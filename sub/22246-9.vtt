00:14.806 --> 00:17.142
[clock chiming]

00:33.366 --> 00:35.869
[car revving outside]

00:55.013 --> 00:57.599
[breath trembling]

01:02.437 --> 01:04.647
[turns faucet on, off]

01:36.429 --> 01:39.099
[theme music playing]

03:13.067 --> 03:15.653
[upbeat music playing]

03:18.656 --> 03:21.868
-It's like meeting a movie star.
-Could be as anti-climactic.

03:21.951 --> 03:25.204
-[Holden] "Crime of the Century."
-Until Charles Whitman two weeks later.

03:25.288 --> 03:29.000
I remember staring at this wanted poster
of him, trying to figure out...

03:29.334 --> 03:31.961
if I saw him on the street,
would I know he was insane?

03:32.045 --> 03:34.756
-You clip all these?
-Everything I could get my hands on.

03:34.839 --> 03:38.301
Even went to my neighbors who subscribed
to newspapers outside of Milwaukee.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.511
Holden and his first criminal crush.

03:40.595 --> 03:44.265
I was home for the summer from college.
It really made an impact.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.726
Nancy didn't sleep for a week
when it hit the front page.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.770
She'd just started nursing school.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.438
It still makes the news.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.440
We should've let that suffice
as our interview.

03:52.523 --> 03:55.151
-Saved ourselves a trip out here.
-He lied all through it.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.903
Why? You don't think he'll lie to us?

03:57.195 --> 03:59.155
Wonder how Bob Greene got him to talk.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.907
Probably by kissing his ass.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.118
He called him a romantic figure.
He's as bad as you.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.163
You would really turn down the chance
to meet Richard Speck?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.958
He's almost up there with Manson.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.585
Well, maybe he'll give you an autograph.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.882
That would be inappropriate, right?

04:56.838 --> 04:57.839
[man] Sign in.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.310
All right. Go ahead.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.191
[bell rings]

05:27.869 --> 05:29.329
Deputy Warden Armstrong.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.331
Holden Ford. This is Bill Tench.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.374
-The headshrink guys?
-[Tench] Behavioral Science Unit.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.917
Thanks for accommodating us.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.087
You're the ones
who painted this place pink?

05:38.588 --> 05:42.091
The feds. You know, some psychology thing.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.219
The color pink
was supposed to keep the animals calm.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.804
How'd that work?

05:46.888 --> 05:47.889
I don't know.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.933
They ate it off the bars
before we could find out.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.397
[indistinct chatter, shouting]

05:56.481 --> 05:58.941
-Is this the only way through?
-This is the way.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.612
We prefer to come in quietly, make it look
like a civil rights investigation.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.530
Look around,
how am I supposed to hide you?

06:04.614 --> 06:07.575
We didn't want him to be seen as a snitch,
suffer reprisals.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.912
As far as I'm concerned, he could suffer
the burning flames of hell for eternity.

06:10.995 --> 06:14.082
-Okay, but that's not what we agreed to.
-God, take it easy.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.709
We pulled him to toss his cell.
Do it twice a month.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.544
It'll look like business as usual.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.047
[man] Armstrong.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.553
[chuckles] From his groupies.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.847
How does a man who slaughtered
eight women have groupies?

06:29.931 --> 06:33.643
Hundreds of them.
Keeps the whole prison stocked in smut.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.314
Stay behind me.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.068
[man] You goddamn motherfucking shits!

06:42.151 --> 06:43.861
Get off of me! I'll fuck you up.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.573
I'll fuck you so hard, your asshole
will come out your motherfucking mouth!

06:47.657 --> 06:50.576
-[man 2] Take it easy, Speck.
-Get your fucking mitts off of my shit!

06:51.035 --> 06:51.953
Son of a bitch!

06:52.036 --> 06:56.332
Fuck your mama's hairy fucking asshole,
you cock-sucking peckerwood!

06:56.415 --> 06:58.584
Shit-bag, motherfucking twat!

06:58.668 --> 07:02.421
I'm gonna shit in your goddamn
fucking poontang, you fuck-ass--

07:03.297 --> 07:04.757
Get off me, you cracker!

07:05.591 --> 07:08.344
I ain't talking to the motherfucking FBI!

07:12.265 --> 07:14.142
I wouldn't say that too loudly,
if I were you.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.310
Fuck you in your fucking mouth.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.940
We'd like to have a conversation, Richard.
Or what do you go by?

07:21.023 --> 07:23.276
I'm not talking to no faggot feds.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.154
Relax. We only want
background information.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.865
Stick your background up your fucking ass.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.285
You're here,
and we're gonna ask you a few questions.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.619
We can make it brief,

07:33.703 --> 07:36.080
or you can scream your head off
and take all day.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.665
You fucking turned my cell out.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.001
How'd you like it
if I looked up your fucking cracks?

07:40.084 --> 07:43.880
I wouldn't like it at all.
Going through your cell was not our idea.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.800
Please.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.552
Have a seat.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.283
We're conducting interviews

08:12.366 --> 08:14.785
with people who've been convicted
of violent crimes.

08:14.869 --> 08:18.748
We'll be asking about family history,
antecedent behavior, and thought patterns

08:18.831 --> 08:21.834
-surrounding the crimes--
-Fuck you, Hoover boys.

08:23.085 --> 08:26.589
Our goal is to publish a statistical
analysis which will not include your name.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.966
-You better know my name.
-[Holden] I beg your pardon?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.801
"Beg your pardon." Fuck you.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.262
We know your name.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.516
Everybody knows your name.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.686
Who else you talking to?

08:41.187 --> 08:44.357
[Holden] People who've been convicted of
similar violent crimes.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.025
-I'm not like them.
-No?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.236
Don't think
you've committed violent crimes?

08:48.319 --> 08:49.320
I didn't say that.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.697
[Holden] How are you not like them?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.366
Them fuckers are crazy.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.951
[bird chirping]

08:55.826 --> 08:56.869
Is that a bird?

09:00.248 --> 09:01.374
Where'd you get it?

09:01.958 --> 09:03.626
[Speck] It had a broken wing.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.004
I fed it meatloaf through an eyedropper.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.172
Oh...

09:08.881 --> 09:10.299
Did you give it a name?

09:11.092 --> 09:12.677
They let you keep a pet here?

09:12.760 --> 09:14.720
As long as I suck their dicks.

09:17.890 --> 09:22.687
It won't surprise you, Richard,
that we want to talk about July 14, 1966.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.898
You'd been drinking since the morning,
is that correct?

09:27.483 --> 09:29.569
You'd gone a few times
to the Maritime Union

09:29.652 --> 09:33.364
to see about getting a job,
but nothing had panned out.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.783
Did this influence your state of mind?

09:39.203 --> 09:43.874
You drank at the Shipyard's Inn Tavern
until after 10:00 p.m.,

09:43.958 --> 09:48.337
when you walked over a mile
to 2319 100th Street.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.008
Did anything about the nurse's apartment
catch your eye?

09:54.552 --> 09:57.930
Was it your intention to commit robbery
when you went to the door?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.274
May I see your... tattoo?

10:11.235 --> 10:14.697
I read about it.
I collected these pieces on you.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.532
The tattoo is kind of legendary.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.826
I always wondered what it looked like.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.873
You're gonna have to roll up my sleeve.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.959
Okay.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.837
Well, come here, then, little boy.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.349
You want to pet my bird, too?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.185
[Holden] Uh, no. Thanks.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.236
You went to the nurse's apartment,
knocked on the door,

10:54.320 --> 10:56.072
one of the young women answered it.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.158
You flashed a knife at her,
pushed your way inside,

10:59.241 --> 11:00.826
realized there were several women home.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.621
Was it still your intention to rob them
at this point?

11:06.207 --> 11:08.376
At what point did you decide to kill them?

11:13.255 --> 11:14.590
-I'm sorry.
-What?

11:14.673 --> 11:15.966
I gotta ask.

11:18.511 --> 11:24.600
What gave you the right
to take eight ripe cunts out of the world?

11:25.559 --> 11:26.811
Some of them looked pretty good.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.064
You ever think you were depriving
the rest of us?

11:31.941 --> 11:35.027
Eight hot pieces of ass.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.905
You think that's fair?

11:38.239 --> 11:41.033
[laughing]

11:42.451 --> 11:43.786
You're crazy.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.997
That's a fine line
that separates you from me.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.708
How the hell did you even fuck
eight women the same night?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.001
What do you eat for breakfast, gunpowder?

11:51.085 --> 11:52.920
-All right.
-I didn't fuck all of them.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.214
That story got blowed
all out of proportion.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.259
-I only fucked one of them.
-The one on the couch?

11:58.342 --> 11:59.969
-That's right.
-[Holden] Why her?

12:00.052 --> 12:01.971
-Could've fucked all of them.
-[Holden] Why didn't you?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.139
They kept coming.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.974
One after the other.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.517
[Holden] What'd you do
when they came home?

12:06.600 --> 12:10.062
I put one in the bedroom,
one in the closet.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.480
You corralled them like ponies?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.941
-[Speck] That's right. Tied them up.
-Why'd you kill them?

12:14.024 --> 12:16.360
Once I killed one,
I had to kill all of them.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.695
[Holden] Why'd you kill the first?

12:17.778 --> 12:20.573
She was crying and all,
she was fucking loud.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.618
You told Bob Greene she spit in your eye,
said she'd pick you out of a lineup.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.954
That son of a bitch,
I should've never talked to him.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.498
-[Holden] Why not?
-He got the whole place all riled up.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.043
-I just wanted to kick back.
-Do your heroin, drink your hootch?

12:33.127 --> 12:35.045
-That's right.
-Where do you get that stuff?

12:35.129 --> 12:36.464
[Speck] Got my sources.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.717
-Made my own still.
-You made a still?

12:39.800 --> 12:43.971
Hid it in a drawer in a guards' desk.
Right under their fucking nose.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.973
They couldn't figure out
what the stink was.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.642
Was that true about the first girl?
She spit at you?

12:48.726 --> 12:52.271
-Because they all sounded pretty timid.
-All right, she got after me.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.064
I told her to shut up.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.317
-Did she shut up?
-[Speck] She did what I said.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.111
-Then why kill her?
-'Cause I wanted to.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.529
[Holden] How'd you do her?

13:00.946 --> 13:01.864
Choked her.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.200
Took forever.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.076
Is that why you stabbed the others?

13:06.160 --> 13:07.828
-It was faster?
-That's right.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.999
Originally, you told them you weren't
gonna kill them, just rob them.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.334
I guess I fucking lied.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.170
-Maybe you got overwhelmed?
-[scoffs] No.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.047
I just decided to kill them.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.508
Except the one.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.551
She was a sneaky bitch.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.094
Hid under a bed.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.932
You know,
I never did have much use for math.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.519
And all them girls, I lost count.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.729
And there was blood fucking everywhere.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.981
Yep, they all looked dead to me.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.316
[Holden] They'd done nothing,

13:37.399 --> 13:42.321
except maybe start crying
when they realized this was it.

13:44.698 --> 13:45.950
Ever wonder why you did it?

13:46.033 --> 13:47.243
No.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.330
-[Holden] Not even curious?
-I don't think about it at all

13:51.413 --> 13:52.915
until peckers like you show up.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.917
What about when you tried to off yourself?

13:55.626 --> 13:57.044
Don't know what you're talking about.

13:57.127 --> 14:00.047
-[Holden] In that motel.
-I didn't do that.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.091
-Well, you slashed your wrists.
-[Speck] Fuck no!

14:02.174 --> 14:03.592
-That was a fight.
-[Holden] What?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.177
-How I got cut.
-Who'd you fight?

14:05.261 --> 14:06.971
Some river coon trying to hustle.

14:07.054 --> 14:10.099
-Just happened to be on both wrists?
-I killed that motherfucker.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.725
-You killed him, too?
-Shit, yeah.

14:11.809 --> 14:15.271
-I didn't see that in the paper.
-Because nobody gives a fuck about that.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.232
You lost a lot of blood.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.443
-Did it hurt?
-I didn't feel fucking nothing.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.321
-Do you still feel nothing?
-That's right.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.157
-[Holden] It feels good, feeling nothing.
-Sure.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.078
[Holden] Are you sure,
when you slashed your wrists,

14:31.662 --> 14:33.247
you didn't feel bad about those girls?

14:33.330 --> 14:34.915
I told you, I didn't do that.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.585
[Holden] Maybe you weren't feeling bad
about the girls.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.421
Maybe you were feeling sorry for yourself.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.881
Fuck you, peckerhead!

14:43.841 --> 14:45.801
-You know why those cunts died?
-[bird chirping]

14:49.471 --> 14:51.432
Because it just wasn't
their fucking night.

14:53.809 --> 14:54.810
[exhales deeply]

14:55.603 --> 14:56.979
Well, that was fucked up.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.359
When he started talking about feeding it
through an eyedropper,

15:02.443 --> 15:04.153
I actually felt sorry for the guy.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.575
We really should videotape
these interviews.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.244
Audio is never gonna do it justice.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.999
A video archive
of our most violent offenders.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.584
Imagine that for posterity.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.923
"It just wasn't their night."

15:32.139 --> 15:34.266
You might want to consider
losing the tape.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.351
What?

15:35.434 --> 15:38.395
Or saying it got mangled.
The recorder chewed it.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.022
Why would I do that?

15:41.148 --> 15:42.608
"Eight ripe cunts."

15:42.691 --> 15:45.235
-I was getting him talking.
-That excuse is wearing thin.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.780
Bill, don't get caught up in semantics.

15:47.863 --> 15:51.241
I don't like the language, and I know
at least one person who won't either.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.953
-Am I supposed to be cowed by Wendy?
-I'm just saying...

15:54.036 --> 15:55.955
You pushed back
when she reamed us about Brudos.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.374
Because we got something worthwhile
from him.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.376
I can do this stuff.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.128
I can choke down the bile,
manufacture empathy,

16:03.212 --> 16:05.089
when our subjects are
at least informative.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.800
-You couldn't choke it down with Brudos--
-Shut up, let me finish.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.386
But someone like Speck
isn't worth our time.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.973
The fact that his death sentence
was commuted is a national disgrace.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.016
We decided no one was
beneath our contempt.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.434
That snail didn't change your mind?

16:17.518 --> 16:19.645
-We can learn from snails.
-What did we learn?

16:19.728 --> 16:24.024
That some subjects have no idea what's
behind the horrific acts they commit.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.527
It was disgusting.
I don't want to be part of it.

16:26.610 --> 16:29.071
-When did you get thin-skinned?
-I'm trying to warn you,

16:29.154 --> 16:31.490
your attitude is gonna
bite you in the ass.

16:32.908 --> 16:37.830
There is no dishonor in losing at least
the first three minutes of that tape.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.916
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will be arriving at Dulles momentarily.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.252
Please make sure
your seat belts are fastened.

16:43.335 --> 16:46.213
Tray tables and seat backs should be
in their upright and locked position.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.797
[typewriter clacking]

17:55.532 --> 17:56.867
[Holden] You know, Gregg...

17:58.744 --> 18:02.206
there are some things in this interview
that were important to, uh...

18:03.332 --> 18:06.835
But maybe best
kept off the permanent record.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.368
He admits to raping only one of the women.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.328
-We already knew that.
-Why does he bring it up?

18:41.411 --> 18:42.704
He wasn't initially forthcoming.

18:42.788 --> 18:46.458
I believe I asked him how he managed
to have sex with all those nurses.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.795
Wait, you caught him off guard,
he told the truth?

18:49.878 --> 18:52.631
-I guess so.
-This rape was committed reflexively.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.592
The crime scene photos indicate
that she was facedown on the couch,

18:55.676 --> 18:57.344
so she was already depersonalized to him.

18:57.427 --> 19:00.097
It was probably just
a "what the fuck" fuck.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.727
So he goes to the boardinghouse drunk,
looking for someone to rob.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.438
And then he finds himself
in this situation with all these women.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.066
He corrals them
and then he rapes one of them.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.361
-To prove he can?
-Statement of sexual competence.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.196
Which he later exaggerates
in the interview,

19:16.280 --> 19:18.907
-claiming he could have raped them all.
-[Holden] He was bragging.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.034
He turned his suicide attempt
into a bar fight.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.661
Yeah, projecting machismo.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.163
-"Born to Raise Hell."
-[Carr] Yes.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.624
It would be interesting to know
how old he was when he got that tattoo.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.170
Because that was the conscious decision
for him to brand himself a badass.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.464
We didn't get much history.
The bird in the fan kind of ended things.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.508
[Carr] That moment? Vintage Speck.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.678
You had just accused him of cowardice
by attempting suicide.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.847
And nobody born to raise hell
is a coward.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.557
The bird was just further demonstration.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.435
I like the part where he doesn't want
to be lumped in with other subjects

19:46.518 --> 19:49.730
-because  they're  crazy.
-[Carr] Again, projection of self-image.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.399
Speck is powerful, superior, exceptional.

19:52.482 --> 19:55.402
But did we learn anything new?
Anything that wasn't in our files?

19:55.485 --> 19:57.571
[Carr] He had no idea
what he was going to do.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.699
Every single act he committed was...
spontaneous.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.159
[Tench] We knew that.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.327
Speck was so out of it,

20:03.410 --> 20:06.496
the woman who answered the door
was the only one he forgot to kill.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.666
Yeah, but to hear him say it,
that's extremely valuable.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.378
We need terminology to distinguish
a Kemper from a Speck.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.924
One drives around with ropes, knives,
plastic bags in his trunk

20:17.007 --> 20:20.802
and returns to a specific hunting ground
looking for specific prey,

20:20.886 --> 20:22.888
while the other just
happens upon his victims.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.389
Organized and disorganized?

20:24.473 --> 20:27.059
[Carr] No. Those terms describe procedure.
I'm looking...

20:27.851 --> 20:29.937
For example,
Charles Whitman is similar to Speck.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.189
He killed 14 people in 90 minutes.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.817
-He's not a sequence killer, he's...
-Whitman was on a spree.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.236
[Carr] His victims weren't selected.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.321
-Just wasn't their night.
-Bill?

20:40.489 --> 20:43.116
Spree is good for Speck or Whitman.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.827
But I think sequence killer is wrong
for someone like Kemper.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.205
-It feels too cadenced.
-Perhaps.

20:48.288 --> 20:52.459
It should feel like a long story.
Continually updated.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.752
A series of killings.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.712
-Serial?
-Serial murderer?

20:55.796 --> 20:56.838
Serial killer?

20:58.173 --> 21:00.425
That's better. Let's see if it sticks.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.097
-Six more years?
-At least.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.848
Another year to complete my Masters,

21:06.932 --> 21:09.559
a year of exams
to get a doctoral candidacy,

21:09.643 --> 21:13.981
and the dissertation takes two if you're
extremely motivated, usually four.

21:14.064 --> 21:17.150
-You drink out of these?
-Just the one that's drying.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.819
Store them upside down.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.612
[blows]

21:21.321 --> 21:24.700
-Anyway, I'll be 30 before I get my PhD.
-That's still impressive.

21:24.783 --> 21:28.078
Is that why I'm doing this?
Who am I trying to impress?

21:28.161 --> 21:30.038
-I thought you loved this stuff.
-"This stuff"?

21:30.122 --> 21:34.126
Yeah, the sociological constructs
that you're always espousing.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.796
-The Goffman and the Higel--
-Hegal.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.256
-Hegal.
-I knew it.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.466
In one ear, out the other,
little Debbie's stuff.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.468
I'm talking generally,
not trying to minimize--

21:43.552 --> 21:46.388
You perk up when I talk about something
that has to do with your work,

21:46.471 --> 21:49.683
-but the rest of the time--
-I don't think you can put this on me.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.561
You've made it clear
I'm not to get between you and your--

21:52.644 --> 21:54.813
"Stuff." Maybe that's all this is.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.858
Maybe that's why I'm wondering if I want
to spend the rest of my life--

21:57.941 --> 21:58.984
Just now doing the math?

21:59.067 --> 22:02.571
Not all of us land feet first
in our ideal vocation, Mr. Ford.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.282
-You think that's me?
-You've found this microscopic niche

22:05.365 --> 22:07.784
interviewing freaks,
and you couldn't be better--

22:07.868 --> 22:09.745
[phone rings]

22:17.669 --> 22:20.130
-Hello?
-Mr. Ford, I have a Mrs. Wade to see you.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.923
-Who?
-Uh, she says--

22:22.507 --> 22:23.925
What is this regarding, ma'am?

22:25.635 --> 22:28.555
-She's the wife of someone you had fired.
-Oh.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.308
She says to remind you
of someone named Roger.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.225
Okay.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.186
If you'd like, I can call somebody.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.354
Send her up.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.568
What?

22:44.154 --> 22:45.113
[sighs]

22:45.947 --> 22:46.907
What is it?

22:54.581 --> 22:56.249
[elevator dings]

23:02.547 --> 23:03.840
Mr. Ford?

23:03.924 --> 23:05.050
Mrs. Wade.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.885
That's right.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.678
How did you find me?

23:08.762 --> 23:10.013
It took a while.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.476
You might not want to follow
a federal agent.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.145
There could be consequences.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.022
You're just a kid.

23:20.107 --> 23:23.610
-What do you want?
-So young to be ruining people's lives.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.070
-Mrs. Wade.
-I'm sure you're aware

23:25.153 --> 23:27.572
that Roger was let go
by the school district.

23:29.407 --> 23:30.784
I was not aware.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.620
Which means he can never again work
in Prince William County.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.332
We've been in our home for 23 years.

23:37.415 --> 23:41.169
We have a daughter who's still
in high school, so moving is impossible.

23:45.173 --> 23:48.969
[Mrs. Wade] He's been looking for work
all over Virginia, Maryland, Delaware,

23:49.052 --> 23:51.513
as a guidance counselor,

23:53.140 --> 23:54.307
a substitute teacher.

23:55.308 --> 23:59.646
But no one wants him near children.
And children are his life.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.690
I am very sorry to hear that,

24:01.773 --> 24:03.775
but I had nothing to do
with your husband--

24:03.859 --> 24:06.903
I understand you told the superintendent
he could be a pedophile.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.155
You've been misinformed.

24:08.238 --> 24:12.075
So... you're saying
that you didn't talk to anyone?

24:12.909 --> 24:16.997
-This was started by teachers.
-You mean Janet Ebner? [scoffs]

24:17.080 --> 24:20.375
Roger was going against the wishes
of faculty and parents.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.628
-He'd been given every opportunity to--
-He did nothing wrong!

24:24.880 --> 24:26.840
[elevator buzzes]

24:28.717 --> 24:30.302
I don't know what to tell you.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.638
I almost don't know him anymore.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.893
[scoffs] I've never seen him so morose.

24:38.476 --> 24:40.812
He doesn't sleep.
I wake up in the middle of the night,

24:40.896 --> 24:44.024
he's in the living room,
staring at snow on the television.

24:45.358 --> 24:47.485
He's almost 50 years old.

24:48.111 --> 24:51.656
We have three children,
two of them are studying to be teachers.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.492
We were respected in the community.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.207
Suddenly, people who've known us
for years

25:00.290 --> 25:02.542
pretend they don't see him on the street.

25:02.626 --> 25:07.255
Someone spray-painted "kiddie fucker"
on our driveway.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.384
Would you like to come in?

25:14.554 --> 25:16.181
You're very young as well.

25:17.474 --> 25:20.060
Do you know what kind of person
you're married to?

25:20.560 --> 25:22.229
We're not married.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.106
Then there's still time.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.031
What did you do?

25:33.114 --> 25:34.115
Nothing.

26:44.477 --> 26:47.063
-What am I looking at?
-Came in from the Atlanta field office.

26:48.189 --> 26:51.192
Twelve-year-old girl raped and murdered
after she got off the school bus.

26:53.987 --> 26:54.821
[Tench] Atlanta?

26:54.904 --> 26:57.324
[Gregg] Adairsville,
60 miles northwest of Atlanta.

27:00.827 --> 27:03.621
Contact the case lead,
see if he'll send us more info.

27:06.708 --> 27:10.462
Lisa Dawn Porter disappeared after being
dropped off at the driveway to her house.

27:10.545 --> 27:13.340
Her body was found in a wooded area,
ten miles away.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.134
Cause of death was determined to be
blunt force trauma to the head,

27:16.217 --> 27:17.510
probably from this rock.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.804
Marks indicate manual strangulation
from behind.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.848
-She was a cheerleader?
-Majorette.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.352
They march with the school band,
twirl batons.

27:25.435 --> 27:28.146
What else do we know about her?
Habits? Personality?

27:28.730 --> 27:30.357
By all reports, she was a good girl.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.777
No drugs, no alcohol,
no boyfriends anyone knows of.

27:33.860 --> 27:37.447
Autopsy indicates that she was a virgin
before all this.

27:37.530 --> 27:40.033
-Low-risk victim, low-risk setting.
-Her clothes were disheveled,

27:40.116 --> 27:42.202
there was no debris on them,
no dirt, no leaves.

27:42.285 --> 27:45.413
They think she was raped in a vehicle,
but killed in the woods.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.707
-Disheveled how?
-The buttons were misaligned.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.959
So she undressed,
probably when the unsub raped her,

27:50.043 --> 27:52.212
and then she got dressed again
in a hurry.

27:52.587 --> 27:54.881
He either allowed her to do it
or he encouraged it.

27:54.964 --> 27:55.924
Mm-hmm.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.510
He put the coat over her face?

27:58.593 --> 28:00.637
[Gregg] That's how she was found.
It was yellow.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.764
A young couple noticed it
walking through the woods.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.182
What do you think that means?

28:06.601 --> 28:11.272
If he places it over her head,
it's like he's covering up what he's done.

28:12.565 --> 28:13.775
-He's ashamed?
-[Holden] Okay.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.860
That's consistent with her
getting dressed.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.112
He's concerned for her.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.239
In that way that child rapists
can be concerned.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.492
Let's say there's shame.
What does that tell us about him?

28:23.535 --> 28:26.079
-This might be his first murder?
-[Holden] Good.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.164
-He's young?
-How young?

28:28.790 --> 28:31.501
Maybe another teenager?
Someone that knew her?

28:31.584 --> 28:35.797
Strangulation. Even 12-year-olds
rarely comply, takes real strength.

28:37.298 --> 28:39.217
-Mid to late 20s?
-That's where I'd put him.

28:39.300 --> 28:42.721
He intercepted her between the bus stop
and her home only a short distance away.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.181
It's possible he knew
when she was coming home from school.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.810
The woods where she was found
is a known make-out spot for locals, so...

28:50.311 --> 28:52.147
-he's likely from the area.
-[Tench] Good.

28:53.022 --> 28:54.733
-They knew each other?
-Can't assume that.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.568
He could have threatened her
at gun or knifepoint.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.111
-Absolutely.
-[Holden] If he knew her schedule,

28:58.194 --> 29:01.489
then he probably planned the kidnapping,
which means he likely planned the rape.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.615
But did he plan the murder?

29:04.242 --> 29:05.869
What does the crime scene tell us?

29:07.912 --> 29:10.749
[Gregg] He left the body in full view
at the scene of the murder.

29:11.082 --> 29:13.460
-He left the murder weapon by the body.
-And the yellow jacket?

29:13.543 --> 29:15.587
-Um...
-It's the opposite of hiding her.

29:17.338 --> 29:20.091
All of this indicates
a disorganized, spontaneous act.

29:23.219 --> 29:25.180
He planned the rape,
he didn't plan the murder.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.182
-He might even feel bad about it.
-Nice.

29:28.349 --> 29:32.520
Thanks. So I should get back to them
and tell them what we're thinking.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.314
Are they expecting to hear back?

29:34.647 --> 29:36.524
Yeah. This isn't just an exercise, is it?

29:40.236 --> 29:43.072
[insects chirping]

29:47.452 --> 29:49.537
[man]
School bus dropped her off right there.

29:50.830 --> 29:54.292
Eighty yards to the driveway,
a hundred yards to the house?

29:54.375 --> 29:56.294
[Holden] Did she even make it
to the driveway?

29:56.711 --> 29:58.379
[man] Well, her mother was home.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.924
She didn't see anything, hear anything.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.717
So he probably picked her up on the road.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.929
We think someone was waiting for her,
knew when the bus would drop her off.

30:06.012 --> 30:07.597
-Think she knew him?
-[Holden] Unclear.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.432
You checked out family, friends?

30:09.766 --> 30:12.644
Looking into it. No red flags so far.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.604
We're sure there's no boyfriend
in the picture?

30:14.687 --> 30:17.732
All her girlfriends say no,
even on the sly.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.817
Was she popular?

30:19.275 --> 30:21.903
Family said she was... gregarious.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.988
-Majorette?
-Mm-hmm. That's right.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.909
The outfit is flashy. Shows off her legs.
Might have been what caught his eye.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.244
Did she wear it to school?

30:29.327 --> 30:30.829
They found it in her backpack.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.331
A stranger who knew her schedule.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.875
He must have been watching her.

30:37.585 --> 30:40.421
-Who would have reason to be out here?
-This is farmland.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.006
Seasonal workers?

30:42.924 --> 30:44.467
Well, I can check.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.470
The area where she was found,
it was familiar to locals?

30:47.762 --> 30:50.014
It's known as a lovers' lane.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.058
-Lovers' lane?
-Jesus.

30:52.141 --> 30:55.979
-Could he have thought of it as a date?
-He truly was not thinking ahead.

30:56.771 --> 30:59.023
We don't believe the unsub
planned the murder.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.900
He certainly didn't try to cover it up.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.485
Like Gregg said,

31:02.569 --> 31:04.988
if he knows about a lovers' lane,
he could be from the area.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.948
And it might not be his first rape.

31:08.157 --> 31:12.036
See what records you've got on young men
in the Floyd and Bartow Counties.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.955
-Yep.
-How often does this get done?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.416
-Hm?
-The trees.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.418
They've been cleared
around the power lines.

31:18.501 --> 31:19.502
[shutter clicks]

31:21.546 --> 31:22.839
[man] Oh...

31:23.339 --> 31:24.883
Well, this is rural Georgia.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.510
Not very often.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.304
Well, those limbs are freshly cut.

31:30.638 --> 31:32.807
You think a service crew
might have been out here?

31:35.351 --> 31:36.352
Thank you.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.481
I just got off a call with Floyd County.

31:40.565 --> 31:44.110
They say they recently questioned a guy
about the rape of a 13-year-old girl.

31:44.193 --> 31:46.029
He works for a tree-limbing service.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.865
-He spent a week on the Porter's street.
-Bingo.

31:49.282 --> 31:52.243
Name's Darrell Gene Devier,
24 years old.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.828
High school dropout.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.665
Was in the army, went AWOL,
discharged after seven months.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.751
-Couldn't handle the military.
-Disorganized.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.586
-Makes sense.
-Single? Married?

32:02.045 --> 32:04.839
Married and divorced twice.
Living with his first ex-wife.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.383
Sexually and socially competent,
if indecisive.

32:07.467 --> 32:08.593
Can't get over the young girls.

32:08.676 --> 32:11.095
Every afternoon,
he watches Lisa get off the bus.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.432
She's got a sunny disposition,
maybe she even talks to him.

32:14.515 --> 32:17.894
He sees her in her majorette outfit.
It makes her look a little older than 12,

32:17.977 --> 32:19.896
and he's able to justify
his attraction to her,

32:19.979 --> 32:22.732
maybe even fantasize
that she would enjoy having sex with him.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.859
But once he's assaulted her,
she is terrified,

32:24.943 --> 32:26.569
she's in pain, she's crying.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.029
Not fun. The fantasy's over.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.698
He realizes, to get away with it,
he has to kill her.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.994
Has her get dressed, he'll let her go.
When she turns around, he strangles her.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.704
It's harder than he thought,
he can't finish.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.206
So he picks up a rock.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.125
After, perhaps shocked
at what he's done or ashamed,

32:41.209 --> 32:42.585
he puts the coat over her head.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.379
[man] We're getting a warrant
to search his car.

32:44.462 --> 32:47.173
-We'll bring him for a lie detector test.
-[Tench] Not recommended.

32:47.256 --> 32:50.677
The outcome of the polygraph can depend
on the quality of the questions.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.679
We use it all the time.
It's standard procedure.

32:52.762 --> 32:55.682
If he's a sociopath, he doesn't register
emotions the way we do.

32:55.765 --> 32:59.394
Wait, you said he might be ashamed
for what he's done.

32:59.852 --> 33:02.939
-Now, how's that square with a sociopath?
-[Tench] Murdering a little girl?

33:03.022 --> 33:05.108
He had the confidence
to take a human life.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.860
If he beats the polygraph,
he'll think he's Superman.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.740
[Shepard]  Thanks for coming up.

33:12.824 --> 33:16.077
It's always a pleasure to see daylight.
What's the bad news?

33:16.160 --> 33:17.829
We have a branch
of the Department of Justice

33:17.912 --> 33:20.164
called the Office
of Professional Responsibility.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.165
That sounds very bad.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.334
They look into allegations
of official misconduct.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.421
Usually there's nothing to it,
but they can make your life difficult.

33:26.504 --> 33:29.716
They are considering investigating
the unit for a civil rights violation.

33:29.799 --> 33:30.925
Is this about Brudos?

33:32.301 --> 33:33.469
This is about Richard Speck.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.847
He was jumped by a couple inmates

33:35.930 --> 33:38.683
after the interview
conducted by Agents Tench and Ford.

33:38.766 --> 33:41.853
Claimed they made a public show
of his meeting with the FBI,

33:42.186 --> 33:43.187
didn't respect his safety.

33:43.271 --> 33:46.858
How the agents interact with the prison
administration is not my purview.

33:46.941 --> 33:49.610
Understood. That's not really the charge
I'm worried about.

33:49.694 --> 33:54.574
Speck also wants to cite Agent Ford
for "fucking with his head."

33:54.657 --> 33:55.491
Anything specific?

33:55.575 --> 33:57.994
No, but we have all suffered
Agent Ford's head fucking.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.955
-Indeed.
-So it has an ominous ring of truth.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.459
What is the format
for evaluating these subjects?

34:04.542 --> 34:08.379
A short script and a questionnaire,
but the agents don't always adhere to it.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.672
Why did you mention Brudos?

34:10.673 --> 34:12.884
During his interview,
Brudos was obfuscating,

34:12.967 --> 34:19.640
so the agents brought in a woman's shoe
to elicit a response.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.142
Was that part of the script?

34:21.225 --> 34:23.853
If I were being polite,
I'd call it bad improvisation.

34:24.228 --> 34:28.274
I'm asking all of this because
no one's crying for Richard Speck.

34:28.357 --> 34:31.110
He can file a complaint
and they are required to look into it.

34:31.194 --> 34:35.114
But these internal affairs types
justify their existence by finding dirt,

34:35.198 --> 34:37.283
and I want to make sure
there's nothing here.

34:37.366 --> 34:38.826
-Nothing that I can think of.
-Good.

34:38.910 --> 34:42.330
Tell the boys that the OPR would like
to see them at their earliest convenience.

34:42.413 --> 34:45.458
They should take all their materials,
everything Speck-related.

34:45.541 --> 34:48.419
You know, I don't want to be their boss.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.214
I'll be the boss. You be the messenger.

34:52.548 --> 34:53.549
All right.

35:00.181 --> 35:03.184
Fucking Richard Speck filed a complaint?
That piece of shit.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.811
We violated his rights.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.313
Those morons at Joliet
didn't do a thing I asked.

35:07.396 --> 35:10.399
Okay, so tell the OPR that.
It sounds like it is just a formality.

35:10.483 --> 35:11.651
It's a pain in the ass.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.612
It shows they're interested.
Take everything that you've got on Speck.

35:14.695 --> 35:18.074
-Like what?
-Like the file, the tape, transcript.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.203
You're coming with us.

35:31.462 --> 35:32.797
Hey. Hey.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.258
The transcript is fine.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.565
Please state your names.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.692
Special Agent William Tench.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.444
Special Agent Holden Ford.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.487
Special Agent Gregg Smith.

36:39.405 --> 36:42.617
In what capacity do you serve
the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

36:43.117 --> 36:44.202
For the record.

36:44.827 --> 36:46.704
We're in the Behavioral Science Unit.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.456
How would you summarize what you do?

36:48.539 --> 36:51.125
-Research.
-Could you be more specific?

36:51.542 --> 36:52.752
[Tench] We're engaged in a study

36:52.835 --> 36:55.129
funded by the Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration

36:55.213 --> 36:57.048
and the National Institute of Justice

36:57.131 --> 36:59.133
to interview criminals
convicted of violent crimes,

36:59.217 --> 37:00.468
classify their behavior,

37:00.551 --> 37:03.638
and create a profiling manual
for domestic law enforcement.

37:03.763 --> 37:04.597
Hm.

37:05.264 --> 37:07.934
You're here because we have complaints
filed against the Bureau

37:08.017 --> 37:10.519
by the Illinois Department of Corrections
on behalf of an inmate

37:10.603 --> 37:13.481
who claims you knowingly
put him in danger with your visitation.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.274
-Richard Speck.
-That's right.

37:15.358 --> 37:19.278
If I may, we made arrangements
that we felt would guarantee his safety.

37:19.362 --> 37:20.321
When we arrived,

37:20.404 --> 37:23.324
the deputy warden took it upon himself
to ignore all of them.

37:23.407 --> 37:26.452
-Were these verbal arrangements, written?
-[Tench] Written.

37:26.535 --> 37:28.537
I have their faxed agreement to our terms.

37:29.997 --> 37:32.750
Agent Ford, you're directly named
in the complaint.

37:33.876 --> 37:38.214
The inmate said you, quote,
"fucked with his head," unquote.

37:38.297 --> 37:41.801
I'm sure the nature of my questioning
brought back uncomfortable memories.

37:41.884 --> 37:44.595
-You asked him about...
-[Holden] The night he killed eight women.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.682
His sexual performance. Stuff like that.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.726
-Are these questions prepared in advance?
-[Tench] We work from this.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.228
But every subject is different.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.189
We usually have to improvise.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.317
With Speck, I applied
a slightly aggressive interview style,

37:58.401 --> 37:59.694
tried to speak his language.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.028
Speak his language?

38:01.112 --> 38:02.363
Get into his rhythm.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.740
I'm assuming you have a record
of the interview.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.033
We have a transcript.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.161
Gregg?

38:16.002 --> 38:18.212
-Where did this come from?
-[Gregg] Tape of the interview.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.505
Tape? You have the tape?

38:20.756 --> 38:24.719
We reuse our tapes.
I'm afraid that we erased that interview.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.223
You erased the interview?

38:29.849 --> 38:30.891
Yes.

38:32.643 --> 38:35.271
We recommend you do not do that
in the future.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.023
[Gregg] No, sir.

38:37.523 --> 38:41.569
I'm assuming your funding would cover
the purchase and archiving of audio tapes.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.570
Yes, sir.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.615
Are there other materials
you have to share with us?

38:47.158 --> 38:50.077
These are the pre-
and post-interview notes on the inmate.

38:50.578 --> 38:51.787
Should be everything.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.707
Gentlemen, we'll review these
and keep you updated on our findings.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.584
What we expect from you
during this process,

38:56.667 --> 38:58.753
more than anything, is candor.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.637
Richard Speck, what a shit stain, huh?

39:08.721 --> 39:11.432
[laughing]

39:11.515 --> 39:12.683
Read to the end.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.643
We should have kept the tape
just for that.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.270
[imitates squawking, laughs]

39:16.354 --> 39:18.356
-Fascinating.
-Thanks, guys.

39:18.439 --> 39:19.982
[elevator dings]

39:22.693 --> 39:24.653
I'm soaking.
I sweat right through my shirt.

39:24.737 --> 39:27.239
-I noticed.
-I'm not good at this.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.991
[Holden] It's over, you did fine.

39:30.576 --> 39:33.412
What should we do with the tape?
Destroy it?

39:33.496 --> 39:35.289
Probably. Where is it?

39:35.748 --> 39:38.167
-In my desk.
-[Holden] Just give it to me.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.044
[Gregg] This whole thing makes me nervous.

39:40.127 --> 39:41.504
[Holden] You said that, Gregg.

39:41.587 --> 39:45.091
It's a prison interview, not Watergate.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.933
-What's going on?
-Maybe you can tell us that.

39:57.603 --> 40:00.314
Holden, would you care to do the honors?

40:02.233 --> 40:04.610
[Shepard] What did you tell
the Office of Professional Responsibility?

40:04.693 --> 40:06.821
Nothing. There was nothing there.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.490
We gave them a transcript, that's all.

40:09.573 --> 40:10.991
So you're in on this, too?

40:12.034 --> 40:13.619
Well, Agent Ford approached me--

40:13.702 --> 40:15.746
Do not say, "Holden made me do it."

40:15.830 --> 40:16.747
Sorry, I apologize.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.833
I don't even know where to begin. Wendy?

40:18.916 --> 40:20.751
"Eight ripe cunts"?

40:20.835 --> 40:23.295
-Sure, let's start there.
-Jesus, not this again.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.089
[Carr] Did you have Gregg redact it?

40:26.173 --> 40:28.884
-So you must have known it was sensitive.
-Sensitive for some people.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.886
-Meaning me.
-I don't like it either.

40:30.970 --> 40:34.557
We can't like everything we do.
We're talking to serial killers.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.017
-"Serial killers"?
-New terminology.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.478
[Shepard] So you're gonna say
and do whatever you want.

40:39.562 --> 40:43.357
Never mind that we are answerable
to the LEAA and the NIJ.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.944
This study is funded with Congressional
dollars, taxpayer money,

40:47.027 --> 40:48.863
which means your interviews
are public record.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.156
[Holden] I would've left it as is.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.283
I really don't have a problem
with this being public.

40:52.366 --> 40:55.453
All of us have to go along
with what you consider to be appropriate?

40:55.536 --> 40:57.580
We've never discussed what's appropriate.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.540
-Of course we have.
-We haven't made decisions.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.917
There's no procedural rule book
for how to talk to these people.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.627
We spent a month drawing up
that questionnaire.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.754
It is a framework for substantive input.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.090
-It doesn't always work.
-[Carr] You haven't let it work.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.718
You're so impatient, you weren't in there
three minutes with Speck

41:10.801 --> 41:12.928
before you got him going
with the cunt speak.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.055
That's when he admitted
to raping only one of the women.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.975
You want truffles,
you gotta get in the dirt with the pigs.

41:18.058 --> 41:19.310
No, we don't.

41:19.393 --> 41:20.769
We are the FBI.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.063
Look at that board.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.150
Look at our work.

41:27.109 --> 41:29.153
Because of that, Bill and I
were able to identify a murderer

41:29.236 --> 41:30.613
last week in Georgia.

41:30.696 --> 41:33.157
This is no longer a theoretical exercise.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.367
That board is mostly the result
of background research,

41:35.451 --> 41:37.620
not priceless gems
you seem to think you're mining.

41:37.703 --> 41:38.913
[Holden] It all goes together.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.499
Everything we do
informs the bigger picture.

41:41.582 --> 41:44.919
Right, and if our tactics blow back on us,
then the whole thing could be jeopardized.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.755
We have at least 40 convicts to interview,
the data will aggregate--

41:47.838 --> 41:49.840
There is no need to wait that long.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.258
What happened in that meeting?

41:53.385 --> 41:56.096
I lied. I outright lied to the OPR.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.389
What did you say?

41:57.473 --> 41:59.308
That I erased the Speck tape.

41:59.391 --> 42:01.810
-You gave them the redacted transcript?
-Yes.

42:03.229 --> 42:07.066
-They don't know about the "ripe cunts."
-They don't care.

42:07.149 --> 42:09.109
So we're all in on a little cover-up here.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.195
I can't be part of a cover-up.

42:11.278 --> 42:14.240
-You told them there was no tape.
-[Gregg] Well, I was, um...

42:14.990 --> 42:16.617
I don't do deceit very well.

42:16.700 --> 42:20.162
There is no way they will know
about the tape unless we tell them.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.164
-We just don't say a thing.
-[Carr] I disagree.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.375
We turn the tape over
and be completely transparent.

42:24.458 --> 42:26.752
If we're caught in a lie,
it'll be very bad.

42:26.835 --> 42:29.046
-I'm okay with it.
-I started this thing.

42:32.132 --> 42:34.426
It is not too late to go back to the OPR.

42:34.510 --> 42:35.928
-And tell them what?
-The truth.

42:36.011 --> 42:38.097
Easy for you to say, Wendy,
you're a consultant.

42:38.180 --> 42:40.224
If they open an investigation,
which they will--

42:40.307 --> 42:41.475
[Tench] Leave it.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.520
Burn the fucking tape.

42:45.521 --> 42:48.107
They don't give a shit about Speck.
Nobody does.

42:49.275 --> 42:50.609
This can die right here.

43:00.369 --> 43:02.329
We are not going to turn in the tape.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.708
We're not going to speak about this
anymore. We will protect the unit.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.127
But something is wrong here.

43:09.878 --> 43:13.215
In my entire professional life,
I've never been put in a position

43:13.299 --> 43:16.802
of having to withhold information
from the Bureau, and I resent it.

43:18.721 --> 43:22.558
Moving forward, establish clear guidelines
for the behavior in these interviews,

43:22.641 --> 43:24.018
and you will adhere to them.

43:24.935 --> 43:27.521
I never want to listen to a tape
where I can't tell the difference

43:27.605 --> 43:30.608
between my agent
and some incarcerated lowlife.
