01:13.900 --> 01:15.600
People have been
struggling to recover

01:15.635 --> 01:17.637
from a record-breaking
heat wave,

01:17.670 --> 01:19.438
and it just keeps getting worse.

01:19.471 --> 01:21.373
Now, it's floods.

01:21.406 --> 01:23.710
Entire towns have
been reduced to ashes.

01:23.743 --> 01:26.311
These fires are now
the most destructive...

01:26.344 --> 01:28.613
Deforestation is
rapidly accelerating.

01:28.648 --> 01:31.718
Oxygen levels
plummet from deforestation.

01:31.751 --> 01:34.319
Extinction revelers
lost the war today.

01:34.352 --> 01:35.722
...as the last tree on Earth

01:35.755 --> 01:37.422
was logged in the Amazon.

01:37.456 --> 01:39.524
Large areas of
ocean algae are dying.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.327
Revolution over Europe
now so widespread...

01:42.360 --> 01:43.930
Fatal respiratory
illness...

01:43.963 --> 01:45.430
Is the biggest
killer in more

01:45.464 --> 01:47.466
than 100 countries
across the globe.

01:47.499 --> 01:48.868
Plant life extinct,

01:48.901 --> 01:50.636
food rations oversubscribed...

01:50.670 --> 01:52.337
And supplies are
stretched beyond...

01:52.370 --> 01:54.372
What the local
charities can support.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.608
Overpopulation in
Africa and the Middle East

01:56.642 --> 01:58.044
now catastrophic.

01:58.077 --> 01:59.746
Reports of oxygen
content dropping.

01:59.779 --> 02:01.346
Synthetic oxygen supplies

02:01.379 --> 02:03.281
buckle under demand
as the UN disbands.

02:03.315 --> 02:04.684
Thousands suffocate in...

02:04.717 --> 02:06.418
And now,
Canada has gone dark.

02:06.451 --> 02:07.687
We've lost India.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.921
After losing
Belgium...

02:08.955 --> 02:10.355
Germany is offline.

02:10.388 --> 02:11.958
China now completely dark.

02:11.991 --> 02:13.558
In all of the
Middle East since January...

02:13.592 --> 02:14.961
O2 supplies
dangerously low as...

02:14.994 --> 02:16.796
As survivors flood
to the last...

02:16.829 --> 02:18.664
...the last city
not in darkness.

02:42.688 --> 02:45.624
Emergency reroute required.

02:45.658 --> 02:49.594
90 seconds until
nuclear core overload.

02:59.571 --> 03:01.674
You down the hall tonight?

03:01.707 --> 03:05.011
Why? You going to grace us
with your presence?

03:10.082 --> 03:12.985
Fill up both.
See if she'll hold.

03:13.019 --> 03:15.755
Danger.
Evacuate utility tunnel.

03:15.788 --> 03:19.491
Yeah. She'll hold.
And hell no, I'm not going.

03:19.524 --> 03:20.993
Oh, come on, man.

03:21.027 --> 03:23.930
There'll be booze
and small talk.

03:23.963 --> 03:25.731
Not for all the oxygen
in the world.

03:25.765 --> 03:27.633
Hey.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.936
Hanging around a bunch
of lowlife foggers.

03:29.969 --> 03:32.972
Lowlife foggers
have feelings too.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.674
Alright. Light it up.

03:38.443 --> 03:41.147
30 seconds until overload.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.115
Evacuation incomplete.

03:43.149 --> 03:47.086
Utility tunnel locking down.

03:47.119 --> 03:48.120
Sealed.

03:48.154 --> 03:50.388
Depressurization imminent.

03:50.422 --> 03:51.958
You know, you might even
find yourself a wife there

03:51.991 --> 03:54.727
one of these nights.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.561
Another mouth to feed,
great plan.

03:56.595 --> 03:57.997
How the hell am I going to
have time for a wife

03:58.030 --> 04:01.701
when I'm stuck down here
wiping your ass every day?

04:01.734 --> 04:04.904
- Right here.
- ...5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

04:04.937 --> 04:06.672
Light it up, baby.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.708
Ah!

04:08.741 --> 04:11.443
Power reroute complete.

04:11.476 --> 04:12.979
System stabilized.

04:18.617 --> 04:22.688
Workers, form an orderly line.

04:22.722 --> 04:26.659
A reminder that oxygen credits
are not transferable.

04:26.692 --> 04:28.460
ChroniCorp... Breathe easy.

04:28.493 --> 04:29.962
Uh, I can't, uh,
do my shift tomorrow,

04:29.996 --> 04:31.163
but it's not a problem.
Uh...

04:31.197 --> 04:33.431
- I'll take it.
- I can make it up.

04:33.465 --> 04:35.500
No. It's not my fault
you don't want to get paid.

04:35.533 --> 04:39.038
- I'll take his shift.
- We're ahead, boss.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.674
Fine. You're in. He's out.

04:41.707 --> 04:43.508
Permanently.

04:43.541 --> 04:45.745
What? No, no. Hey, hey.

04:45.778 --> 04:47.079
- You good?
- Yeah, man.

04:47.113 --> 04:48.814
It's more money in the pocket.

04:48.848 --> 04:52.517
O2 is currently at 3.3%.

04:52.550 --> 04:54.552
Come on. Let's go.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.656
Where the hell is he?

04:56.689 --> 04:58.057
Hey, man.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.060
Georgie, I need the money
tomorrow.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.495
He owes me money for that.

05:03.528 --> 05:05.463
Hey, Jerry.
How you doing?

05:05.497 --> 05:07.833
There's no fire without oxygen.
There's no fire without oxygen.

05:07.867 --> 05:09.201
Yeah.
You got any smart ideas?

05:09.235 --> 05:10.602
- Get out of here.
- There's no fire without oxygen.

05:10.636 --> 05:12.138
- Get out of here.
- Hey.

05:12.171 --> 05:13.806
- Why don't you just leave it?
- No. You listen to me.

05:13.839 --> 05:15.908
- There's no fire without oxygen.
- It's always something.

05:25.251 --> 05:26.953
...for generations to come.

05:26.986 --> 05:28.754
Hey. No, listen.

05:28.788 --> 05:31.791
We have to sacrifice it all
for the generations to...

05:35.061 --> 05:37.697
Oxygen is not a privilege.

05:37.730 --> 05:40.700
You're not listening,
and I will make you listen.

05:40.733 --> 05:43.601
- Okay. Alright.
- I need my job.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.972
- Get off me.
- My kids got the sickness too.

05:46.005 --> 05:47.940
- I will make you listen.
- What do you want me to do?

05:47.974 --> 05:50.042
- We all need to...
- Listen to me.

05:50.076 --> 05:54.880
You know that oxygen
is not a privilege.

06:12.865 --> 06:15.533
Another suicide protest today

06:15.567 --> 06:17.602
marked the anniversary
of the death

06:17.636 --> 06:20.840
of the last
living plant in captivity.

06:20.873 --> 06:23.275
Since the believed extinction
of plant life,

06:23.309 --> 06:26.178
deaths have continued
to spiral out of control

06:26.212 --> 06:29.949
due to biophysical rejections
of the synthetic oxygen

06:29.982 --> 06:33.119
that humanity
has come to rely on.

06:33.152 --> 06:35.955
As the leading distributor
of synthetic O2,

06:35.988 --> 06:38.590
ChroniCorp is still committed
to finding a solution

06:38.623 --> 06:42.328
to this oxygen crisis that the
world has termed The Sickness.

06:42.361 --> 06:45.931
However, citizens continue
to revolt amid fears

06:45.965 --> 06:48.934
that this may be the end
for humankind.

06:48.968 --> 06:51.670
ChroniCorp's quantum physicist
Dr. Richard Whyte

06:51.704 --> 06:54.874
once radically posed that
in the unlikely event

06:54.907 --> 06:57.043
that humanity
survives this crisis,

06:57.076 --> 06:59.678
could we somehow find a solution

06:59.712 --> 07:02.148
from our descendants
in the future?

07:02.181 --> 07:03.581
Some suggest that his death

07:03.615 --> 07:06.185
some 20 years ago
is linked to...

07:28.841 --> 07:30.976
- Oh, my...
- Hi.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.712
Hi.

07:33.746 --> 07:36.715
Did I just hear your dad's name?

07:36.749 --> 07:38.384
I got something for you.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.685
Oh?

07:39.718 --> 07:43.155
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

07:43.189 --> 07:44.957
- Are they closed?
- Yes.

07:44.990 --> 07:47.960
- Alright. Keep them closed.
- Mm-hmm.

07:47.993 --> 07:49.662
Keep them closed.

07:49.695 --> 07:51.730
Okay. Okay.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.299
Open.

07:55.134 --> 07:56.869
What did you do this time?

07:56.902 --> 07:59.972
See, um, the strap is loose
on the other one, and I...

08:00.005 --> 08:02.108
I... I still have to seal it,
and, well,

08:02.141 --> 08:04.176
this one is compatible
with the high-grade O2.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.945
I don't need that.

08:05.978 --> 08:08.914
Okay. It's fine.
I-I-I got a new shift.

08:38.277 --> 08:40.079
But this is fashion.

08:40.112 --> 08:41.280
It looks great.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.415
Yeah, it does.

08:43.449 --> 08:44.984
Really?

08:45.017 --> 08:46.719
Oh. What?

08:46.752 --> 08:48.053
Don't you want to look
pretty too?

08:48.087 --> 08:49.722
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

08:49.755 --> 08:51.857
Don't... Don't start this again.
Remember what they said.

08:51.891 --> 08:53.225
- You need to calm down.
- Okay.

08:53.259 --> 08:55.728
You need... you... you...
you need to relax.

08:55.761 --> 08:58.297
Shit.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.466
Are you okay?

09:00.499 --> 09:03.002
- Sorry.
- J-Just give it to me.

09:03.035 --> 09:05.905
It's fine.

09:05.938 --> 09:08.007
- Please.
- It's fine.

09:09.141 --> 09:10.709
Shit.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.932
Citizen number 34465?

09:36.235 --> 09:38.037
We've been instructed
to bring you upstairs.

09:38.070 --> 09:40.005
We've got clearance
to be down here.

09:42.007 --> 09:43.943
He doesn't like to be touched.

09:43.976 --> 09:45.477
He'll go if I go.

09:47.813 --> 09:49.248
Let's just see
what they've got to say.

09:49.281 --> 09:50.482
Come on.

09:53.986 --> 09:55.754
Greetings, citizen.

09:55.788 --> 09:59.091
Welcome to the Applied Sciences
Division of ChroniCorp.

09:59.124 --> 10:01.260
ChroniCorp is proud to be
the largest supplier

10:01.293 --> 10:03.929
of breathable air
to the people of the world.

10:03.963 --> 10:06.031
ChroniCorp... Breathe easy.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.401
Greetings, citizen.

10:09.435 --> 10:12.938
Welcome to the Applied Sciences
Division of ChroniCorp.

10:12.972 --> 10:15.107
ChroniCorp is proud to be
the largest supplier

10:15.140 --> 10:17.276
of breathable air
to the people of the world.

10:30.122 --> 10:32.324
Even the fires
burn themselves out.

10:36.161 --> 10:37.863
They can't breathe, either.

10:43.902 --> 10:45.571
My name is Regina Jackson.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.007
I'm the CTO of
Particle Research.

10:51.343 --> 10:55.080
And you're Ethan Whyte.

10:55.114 --> 10:57.049
Um, yes, ma'am.

11:00.052 --> 11:03.022
How's your wife?
Our records show...

11:03.055 --> 11:04.556
I'm looking after her.

11:08.628 --> 11:10.896
We've all accepted
that things today

11:10.929 --> 11:14.466
are even worse
than what scientists predicted.

11:14.500 --> 11:18.170
The fact is
the O2 rejection epidemic

11:18.203 --> 11:21.140
is going to wipe out the human
race within a handful of years.

11:21.173 --> 11:22.875
I appreciate you bringing us
up here, but...

11:22.908 --> 11:24.310
but what exactly
are you offering?

11:24.343 --> 11:27.079
What if I told you that
you could save all of us?

11:33.619 --> 11:35.554
I-I'd hate to seem like
I don't appreciate

11:35.587 --> 11:37.089
this show-and-tell,
but I think we should go.

11:37.122 --> 11:39.525
Your security
has been upgraded.

11:39.558 --> 11:41.260
You'll be briefed at the lab.

11:51.170 --> 11:54.206
Welcome to our Hail Mary.

11:54.239 --> 11:55.974
Meet the Chronicle.

12:02.348 --> 12:04.183
Billy Mitchell.

12:04.216 --> 12:07.886
An absolute honor
to meet you, Ethan.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.421
So you're the one.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.225
Interesting.

12:20.999 --> 12:23.502
Ethan, do you know
what your father did here?

12:33.946 --> 12:35.280
Alright.

12:35.314 --> 12:37.049
3 minutes, 10 seconds.

12:37.082 --> 12:39.084
Calibration is within tolerance.

12:42.287 --> 12:44.323
It's taken us 20 years.

12:44.356 --> 12:48.961
If only your father
could see this.

12:48.994 --> 12:52.398
My father's not here, is he?

12:52.431 --> 12:56.201
Right. Of course. I'm sorry.

12:56.235 --> 12:58.437
During our first trial,
we tested the Chronicle

12:58.470 --> 13:01.407
with something that wouldn't
take as much power as matter...

13:01.440 --> 13:04.143
radio waves to act
like a sort of ping

13:04.176 --> 13:06.145
to see what was
on the other side.

13:06.178 --> 13:08.380
The radio waves bounced back,

13:08.414 --> 13:10.082
but they had been changed.

13:10.115 --> 13:12.184
There was something
encoded inside.

13:12.217 --> 13:15.087
Bounced back, what?
What do you mean, bounced back?

13:15.120 --> 13:16.388
From where?

13:16.422 --> 13:19.057
Not where, when.

13:19.091 --> 13:23.228
We received a message
from the future.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.397
From the future?

13:25.431 --> 13:27.399
This is a fucking time machine?

13:27.433 --> 13:30.637
407 years into the future.

13:30.670 --> 13:34.006
400 years?

13:34.039 --> 13:37.042
You're telling me people
are still alive then?

13:37.075 --> 13:39.611
The message was simple, Ethan.

13:39.646 --> 13:44.049
Red, decode
Chronicle file 170681.

13:44.082 --> 13:45.584
Up here.

14:04.704 --> 14:06.338
The people
who sent the message

14:06.371 --> 14:08.106
must have found a cure
for the O2 sickness.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.608
It's impossible.

14:09.642 --> 14:11.376
There's no other way
they could still be alive

14:11.410 --> 14:12.712
that far in the future.

14:12.745 --> 14:15.347
We think they want to give
the cure to us

14:15.380 --> 14:19.017
so that we could
save more people here.

14:19.051 --> 14:20.687
Why ask for me?

14:20.720 --> 14:23.656
We don't exactly know why,

14:23.690 --> 14:26.759
but we may only get one shot
at sending someone.

14:28.761 --> 14:30.596
One shot?

14:30.630 --> 14:33.532
The Chronicle feeds off the
nuclear reactor under the city.

14:33.565 --> 14:37.469
Just to fire a clock
a few minutes through time

14:37.503 --> 14:40.239
knocks large sections
of the city off the grid.

14:40.272 --> 14:42.775
To fire the mass
of a human that far?

14:42.809 --> 14:45.344
Let's just say I hope we
don't have to try this twice.

14:45.377 --> 14:49.381
Why do I get the feeling
that there's a catch?

14:49.414 --> 14:55.722
Ethan, we don't know yet
how to bring you back.

15:00.727 --> 15:02.594
You want to shoot me
into oblivion with...

15:02.629 --> 15:04.263
with no way to get home?

15:04.296 --> 15:06.298
You have to find
the people who sent the message.

15:06.331 --> 15:08.567
They can help you get back.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.738
You have got to find the cure.

15:11.771 --> 15:14.373
You may be humanity's
only chance.

15:16.876 --> 15:18.811
You may be your wife's
only chance.

15:24.483 --> 15:29.154
Beautiful, crisp,
clean air, all you can breathe,

15:29.187 --> 15:31.623
only $20 an hour.

15:34.727 --> 15:37.730
Have you ever seen
anything like that shit before?

15:37.764 --> 15:41.300
- Two more.
- It's all very impressive.

15:41.333 --> 15:44.637
I'm not leaving Xanthe
as a favor to those ghouls.

15:49.608 --> 15:52.311
Use it.

15:54.546 --> 15:57.416
He's buying.

15:58.885 --> 16:02.287
Ah. Alright. Alright.

16:06.558 --> 16:08.661
What's the matter
with you?

16:08.695 --> 16:10.596
What?

16:10.630 --> 16:14.499
Do you... do you really believe
I'm going to save the world?

16:14.533 --> 16:16.769
Very romantic.

16:16.803 --> 16:20.272
You need to take this seriously.

16:20.305 --> 16:21.573
Your old man believed them.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.876
My old man was a fool
and a liar.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.819
What if there's more
to his story, Ethan?

16:34.921 --> 16:37.322
Story?

16:37.356 --> 16:38.891
You want to hear more?

16:42.795 --> 16:47.165
A father leaves a suicide note
for his 8-year-old son.

16:47.199 --> 16:50.302
If he'd just been there instead
of chasing fucking rainbows,

16:50.335 --> 16:53.605
my mother would
still be alive.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.341
Very heroic,

16:56.375 --> 16:58.610
and as if this wasn't enough
of a reminder of that,

16:58.645 --> 17:00.379
you want me to do what?

17:00.412 --> 17:03.850
Follow in his footsteps
to leave my sick wife to die?

17:13.960 --> 17:15.895
I remember when I brought you
down in the tunnels

17:15.928 --> 17:17.664
for the first time.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.803
You were so scared
of just being left alone.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.537
Remember what I told you?

17:27.907 --> 17:30.308
"Without the darkness,
there's no light."

17:30.342 --> 17:32.779
Stupid saying.

17:32.812 --> 17:35.313
Fuck you.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.349
Listen, shithead.

17:37.382 --> 17:39.852
I've been through hell
and back in this life.

17:39.886 --> 17:43.488
I've lost my family,
damn near lost my mind.

17:43.522 --> 17:44.857
I've been working in
those fucking tunnels

17:44.891 --> 17:46.291
for as long as I can remember,

17:46.324 --> 17:48.628
and the only thing
I know that works

17:48.661 --> 17:52.364
is when we fight for ourselves,
protect what's ours.

17:52.397 --> 17:54.266
I can protect Xanthe.

17:54.299 --> 17:58.270
I'm not just going
to abandon her.

17:58.303 --> 18:00.539
And what are you going to do
when she gets worse?

18:04.609 --> 18:07.479
This ain't about
saving the world, bro.

18:12.284 --> 18:14.987
You want to prove
that you're not like him?

18:15.021 --> 18:16.723
Save her.

19:00.398 --> 19:02.001
He's been waiting for you
all day.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.514
I made this for you,
Ethy,

19:15.547 --> 19:17.884
because I have it
on good authority

19:17.917 --> 19:22.454
that you are going to grow up
to be someone very important.

19:22.487 --> 19:25.057
A science man?

19:25.091 --> 19:26.793
A science man.

19:30.730 --> 19:37.036
Now, this is going to hurt
a little,

19:37.069 --> 19:41.540
but it will help you become
who you are meant to be.

19:41.573 --> 19:46.378
Now, one day you'll understand.

19:46.411 --> 19:49.115
You will want to trust what you
can see with your own eyes,

19:49.148 --> 19:54.352
but it won't be enough, and you
will need to make a choice

19:54.386 --> 19:57.690
about whether you believe
in something bigger.

20:00.126 --> 20:01.828
Believe in what?

20:05.031 --> 20:06.732
Believe in people.

20:36.461 --> 20:38.563
I'm sorry, Ethy.
You're done.

20:38.597 --> 20:42.601
It won't come off.

20:42.635 --> 20:44.402
What's wrong with you?

20:44.436 --> 20:47.173
Papa...

20:47.206 --> 20:49.574
Don't you dare
leave us again.

21:02.688 --> 21:04.389
When?

21:07.525 --> 21:10.730
I'm not leaving you to chase
some stupid fantasy.

21:10.763 --> 21:13.766
You think a second chance
is a fantasy?

21:13.799 --> 21:16.501
How could you say that?

21:16.534 --> 21:18.004
Fucking scientists.

21:18.037 --> 21:19.939
Do you think your tool kit
is important right now?

21:19.972 --> 21:21.606
My tools need to be clean.

21:21.641 --> 21:22.642
Look at me.

21:22.675 --> 21:24.810
I have responsibilities here.

21:24.844 --> 21:26.045
I need to meet my shifts.

21:26.078 --> 21:27.545
We're... We're so close

21:27.579 --> 21:29.115
to having enough for
the high-grade O2.

21:29.148 --> 21:30.615
That could help you.

21:30.650 --> 21:31.817
It could slow down the symptoms.

21:31.851 --> 21:35.054
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

21:35.087 --> 21:37.657
What?

21:37.690 --> 21:40.092
You can say that you're afraid,

21:40.126 --> 21:42.895
but don't you dare use me
as an excuse.

21:42.929 --> 21:45.530
You're better than that, Ethan.

21:45.563 --> 21:47.532
What?

21:47.565 --> 21:49.534
What are you talking about?

21:49.567 --> 21:50.870
You're everything to me.

21:50.903 --> 21:53.906
I-I can look after you.
I can help you.

21:53.940 --> 21:57.777
I-I can make more money.
I can make you okay.

21:57.810 --> 21:59.577
Who's to say that time
is anything

21:59.611 --> 22:01.579
we should mess with anyway?
What if I can't change anything?

22:01.613 --> 22:02.915
Who's to say that we can't?

22:02.949 --> 22:05.517
Okay. What if I could?

22:05.550 --> 22:08.486
What if I mess with something,
and it makes everything worse?

22:12.590 --> 22:15.928
I can't believe what I'm hearing
right now.

22:15.962 --> 22:18.965
No. I'm not going to risk
losing you.

22:18.998 --> 22:20.598
You can't lose me.

22:20.633 --> 22:22.534
Of course I can.

22:22.567 --> 22:26.772
You've got to have faith, Eth,

22:26.806 --> 22:29.574
that you can be bigger.

22:32.111 --> 22:34.213
Faith isn't going
to protect you.

22:36.581 --> 22:39.685
Now is not the time to have
your tail between your legs.

22:41.654 --> 22:44.023
We're a team.

22:44.056 --> 22:45.958
Why aren't you on my side?

22:48.761 --> 22:52.031
Last year, I had
20 kids in my class.

22:52.064 --> 22:53.866
This year, I have 12.

22:56.168 --> 22:59.005
I saw three of them suffocate
right in front of me.

23:03.075 --> 23:04.944
You're the only one
I care about.

23:06.946 --> 23:09.547
I wouldn't be with you
if I thought that was true.

23:12.151 --> 23:18.057
I'm afraid too, Ethan.

23:18.090 --> 23:21.327
I know that you'll come back
to me.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.295
I believe in you.

24:05.337 --> 24:07.273
Papa!

24:07.306 --> 24:10.743
Fuck.

24:10.776 --> 24:13.112
Papa...

24:20.419 --> 24:23.756
Your father is not here.

25:38.097 --> 25:42.101
I don't care if I can only find
one dose of this cure.

25:42.134 --> 25:46.138
Xanthe gets the first one,
or I'm not going.

25:46.172 --> 25:48.474
You need me.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.476
Okay, Ethan.

25:50.509 --> 25:52.211
We have a deal.

25:55.381 --> 25:58.350
These aren't just
space suits, Ethan.

25:58.384 --> 26:00.786
These are my babies.

26:00.819 --> 26:03.189
Fenrir is not quite ready,

26:03.222 --> 26:07.426
but, Tyr, she'll get you there.

26:07.459 --> 26:09.061
She'll protect you.

26:09.094 --> 26:10.362
The Chronicle, at this time,

26:10.396 --> 26:12.364
can't tether to itself
in the future.

26:12.398 --> 26:15.334
There's something wrong
at the other end.

26:15.367 --> 26:16.936
What the hell does that mean?

26:16.969 --> 26:20.239
It means we're going to
have to throw you there.

26:20.272 --> 26:21.840
Throw me there?

26:21.874 --> 26:23.042
Without being tethered
at the other end,

26:23.075 --> 26:25.878
there's a chance you could land

26:25.911 --> 26:27.980
inside a mountain
or the ocean, so...

26:28.013 --> 26:31.150
You've got to be kidding me.

26:31.183 --> 26:33.185
We have to aim a little higher.

26:36.889 --> 26:38.157
We'll land you as close
as we can

26:38.190 --> 26:41.126
to the source
of the radio waves.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.928
You just find the people.

26:42.962 --> 26:46.365
Track them down and bring
the cure back home to us.

26:46.398 --> 26:49.501
Sounds easy.

26:49.535 --> 26:52.304
This may be humankind's
most critical journey.

26:54.273 --> 26:56.742
I'm counting on you to find
a way back, Ethan.

27:03.115 --> 27:04.917
Okay.

27:04.950 --> 27:07.553
One more time, focus.

27:07.586 --> 27:09.288
Who's this?

27:09.321 --> 27:10.889
- Archie.
- Yeah.

27:10.923 --> 27:12.458
What does Archie do?

27:12.491 --> 27:17.029
Um, systems analysis,
navigation, communication.

27:17.062 --> 27:18.130
Yeah. That's right.

27:18.163 --> 27:20.032
Archie is your only friend,

27:20.065 --> 27:21.900
so treat her well.

27:21.934 --> 27:25.170
The suit will feed your vitals
back to us from Archie,

27:25.204 --> 27:27.072
so we're going
to know you're safe.

27:27.106 --> 27:30.542
We'll be watching.

27:30.576 --> 27:32.444
Hold your breath.

27:32.478 --> 27:35.547
Look at me.

27:35.581 --> 27:37.082
Do not let go.

27:41.887 --> 27:46.325
Timing quantum forward.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.137
Look after her.

27:58.170 --> 27:59.872
Only till you get back.

28:12.618 --> 28:14.320
See you soon, brother.

28:16.388 --> 28:18.090
Go bring back the light.

28:27.933 --> 28:33.872
Ignition in 20, 19, 18, 17,

28:33.906 --> 28:40.245
16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11,

28:40.279 --> 28:44.450
10, 9, 8, 7,

28:44.483 --> 28:51.190
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

28:59.231 --> 29:01.033
Ethan.

33:09.214 --> 33:10.783
Hello.

33:17.489 --> 33:19.524
Come on.

33:19.558 --> 33:21.526
Ethan Whyte. Come in!

33:21.560 --> 33:24.363
Ethan Whyte to base. Come in!

33:28.735 --> 33:32.437
- Archie?
- Hello, Ethan.

33:32.471 --> 33:34.807
Archie, where are we?

33:34.841 --> 33:37.542
Let me find a satellite.

33:37.576 --> 33:39.946
Satellite link failed.

33:39.979 --> 33:43.448
Location unknown.

33:43.482 --> 33:45.417
Searching. Searching.

33:45.450 --> 33:47.619
Satellite link failed.

33:47.654 --> 33:51.256
Archie,
geography magnetics, go.

33:56.294 --> 33:58.765
I have detected a structure.

33:58.798 --> 34:00.867
It's not far.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.601
Follow me.

34:22.722 --> 34:24.423
Fuck.

36:14.466 --> 36:16.702
Am I going to die here?

36:40.993 --> 36:42.728
Fuck you.

36:50.002 --> 36:51.103
Archie?

36:51.137 --> 36:52.872
I'm here, Ethan.

36:56.608 --> 36:58.878
Why are there two of me
here at once?

36:58.911 --> 37:01.914
I don't think this is
a second you, Ethan.

37:01.948 --> 37:05.084
I think this is you.

37:05.117 --> 37:10.555
So I'm dead and alive
at the same time?

37:10.589 --> 37:13.759
Even I have trouble
with time travel, Ethan.

37:16.629 --> 37:18.631
Very helpful, thanks.

37:18.664 --> 37:20.365
My pleasure.

38:29.068 --> 38:30.602
Archie?

38:30.636 --> 38:32.171
Yes, Ethan?

38:35.708 --> 38:37.009
Status.

38:37.043 --> 38:40.713
Nuclear cell at 2%,
display offline.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.050
Replay last recording.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.719
Am I going to die here?

38:46.752 --> 38:48.054
Maybe it's better this way.

38:48.087 --> 38:49.789
No one is suffering anymore.

38:49.822 --> 38:51.724
What did you have to sacrifice?

38:51.757 --> 38:53.826
I am your family.

38:53.859 --> 38:57.096
you.

38:59.665 --> 39:02.068
Ah, please!

39:02.101 --> 39:03.769
Please!

39:03.803 --> 39:06.939
No, no!

39:10.575 --> 39:11.877
Power failure.

39:11.911 --> 39:13.746
Shutting down. Goodbye.

39:13.779 --> 39:14.914
No, no, no, no!

39:14.947 --> 39:17.216
Archie! Archie!

39:58.190 --> 39:59.591
Diagnose.

39:59.624 --> 40:01.027
Signal found.

40:01.060 --> 40:02.962
It's an emergency beacon.

40:02.995 --> 40:04.864
We should make contact.

40:04.897 --> 40:06.332
Follow me.

40:51.377 --> 40:53.112
Hello?

41:05.057 --> 41:08.227
Hello?

41:08.260 --> 41:10.229
Rub the sticks together.

41:10.262 --> 41:11.831
Friction makes fire.

41:11.864 --> 41:15.000
Easy, peasy.

41:15.034 --> 41:16.836
Rub. Rub.

41:16.869 --> 41:18.104
Easy, peasy.

41:18.137 --> 41:19.705
- Easy, peasy.
- Easy, peasy.

41:19.738 --> 41:20.806
Easy, peasy.

41:20.840 --> 41:24.043
Fire takes time, Ethan.

41:24.076 --> 41:25.044
Come on.

41:25.077 --> 41:27.213
Rub, rub, rub.

41:27.246 --> 41:29.014
Even I have trouble with fire.

41:29.048 --> 41:31.350
Come on!

41:31.383 --> 41:32.918
Keep at it!

41:32.952 --> 41:34.420
- Easy, peasy.
- Ugh!

41:34.453 --> 41:36.155
Rub, rub, rub!

41:36.188 --> 41:37.256
- Ugh!
- Good.

41:37.289 --> 41:38.791
Now blow.

41:38.824 --> 41:40.893
Blow, blow, blow, blow.

41:54.039 --> 41:55.841
Fire!

42:01.380 --> 42:03.082
Easy, peasy.

42:22.101 --> 42:24.303
Unidentified.

42:24.336 --> 42:26.872
Gee, thanks.

42:42.321 --> 42:43.956
Ugh.

42:48.894 --> 42:50.462
Scanning.

42:50.496 --> 42:52.164
Scanning.

42:52.198 --> 42:54.500
Star formations synchronized.

42:54.533 --> 42:57.803
Date... 2474 AD.

43:12.518 --> 43:14.286
Stars.

43:16.222 --> 43:19.525
Stars.

43:19.558 --> 43:21.994
Stars.

43:24.797 --> 43:26.365
How are we like stars?

43:26.398 --> 43:28.100
That's silly.

43:32.838 --> 43:34.073
Okay.

43:34.106 --> 43:36.809
Try this.

43:40.512 --> 43:42.414
So you see, Ethy,

43:42.448 --> 43:44.516
I will never
let anything happen to you.

44:10.909 --> 44:12.978
Fuck you!

44:13.012 --> 44:14.980
Fuck you!

44:31.263 --> 44:32.998
Ah!

45:14.674 --> 45:18.210
No, wait. Ethan, please.

45:18.243 --> 45:20.045
You're not real!
You're not real!

45:20.079 --> 45:21.580
You're not real!

45:21.613 --> 45:24.016
Ethan, you're hallucinating.

45:24.049 --> 45:26.285
What the... What the hell?

45:26.318 --> 45:29.455
You poisoned yourself

45:29.488 --> 45:32.157
because of the gallberries.

45:46.271 --> 45:48.207
Jude?

45:50.409 --> 45:54.446
You're going to be okay, kid,
as long as you do what I say.

45:57.049 --> 45:59.385
Right away, we knew
something was wrong.

45:59.418 --> 46:01.620
We could see your pulse
echoing back.

46:01.654 --> 46:04.691
Then your blood-toxicity
level spiked.

46:04.724 --> 46:06.693
Poison.

46:06.726 --> 46:09.128
Your heart stopped.

46:09.161 --> 46:11.029
You know, I watched you die,
Ethan.

46:15.735 --> 46:17.436
I'm not dead.

46:20.472 --> 46:22.408
Am I?

46:22.441 --> 46:24.143
I don't think so.

46:27.613 --> 46:29.181
But Billy said he had
just enough power

46:29.214 --> 46:33.252
to fire the Chronicle
one last time.

46:33.285 --> 46:36.121
I grabbed a second suit.

46:36.155 --> 46:38.991
Couldn't leave you down here
all by your lonesome.

46:39.024 --> 46:41.326
I told him I could
bring you back.

46:46.031 --> 46:47.566
You came for me.

46:51.638 --> 46:53.305
I hit the ground
like a ton of bricks.

46:53.338 --> 46:57.009
Everything was destroyed...
my suit, everything.

46:57.042 --> 47:01.079
I'm just happy to be alive, man,
happy to see your ugly mug,

47:01.113 --> 47:03.182
happy to be breathing
without a fucking mask.

47:03.215 --> 47:04.950
Xanthe?

47:08.320 --> 47:10.022
Man, she needs you.

47:13.192 --> 47:15.260
There's a problem.

47:20.633 --> 47:23.101
What the hell is this?

47:23.135 --> 47:27.172
I thought you saved me,
but I'm still dead.

47:27.206 --> 47:30.743
No.

47:30.777 --> 47:35.347
No. This isn't right.
I mean, this isn't you.

47:35.380 --> 47:38.685
I thought you said
I was poisoned.

47:38.718 --> 47:41.487
You were.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.255
I mean, we changed that.

47:45.491 --> 47:47.192
Didn't we?

47:55.100 --> 47:56.368
Something is very wrong.

47:56.401 --> 47:58.738
You think?

47:58.771 --> 48:02.074
Listen, was there
anything else here?

48:02.107 --> 48:06.178
Like... like what?

48:06.211 --> 48:07.379
A gun?

48:10.582 --> 48:14.486
I'd say whoever left that hole
in my head took off with it.

48:14.520 --> 48:17.289
Listen, this fucking
bag of bones is not you.

48:21.493 --> 48:23.328
Been eating berries again, huh?

48:33.706 --> 48:37.075
Well, whoever sent for me,
for them to survive

48:37.109 --> 48:40.279
this long to regrow this place,

48:40.312 --> 48:43.215
they must have found a cure.

48:43.248 --> 48:45.584
If I don't find them in time,
Xanthe's...

48:48.153 --> 48:49.254
- Well, let's find them.
- Yeah.

48:49.288 --> 48:51.691
We were sent here for a reason.

48:58.130 --> 48:59.832
Now we follow the bread crumbs.

49:09.842 --> 49:14.346
Emergency beacon
saturation 98%.

49:14.379 --> 49:16.049
We're close.

49:28.728 --> 49:31.698
Ready?

49:31.731 --> 49:34.734
Let's see if anyone's home.

49:34.767 --> 49:36.636
I got your back.

50:38.230 --> 50:39.766
Hello?

50:46.806 --> 50:48.540
Careful.

50:48.573 --> 50:50.275
Hello?

50:54.013 --> 50:56.348
Ethan!

50:56.381 --> 50:57.917
Hey, stick with me, Jude.

51:15.868 --> 51:17.436
I can't see shit.

51:59.078 --> 52:00.847
Activate what?

52:18.330 --> 52:19.331
Ah!

52:19.364 --> 52:21.299
Shit!

52:23.970 --> 52:25.638
Come out!

52:38.117 --> 52:39.852
Access?

52:58.470 --> 53:00.539
Not possible.

53:00.572 --> 53:02.474
Hello, GRID One.

53:02.507 --> 53:03.575
Hail Mary, brother.

53:03.608 --> 53:07.747
Hello, relegating 1,270.

53:07.780 --> 53:11.651
Ethan Whyte, DNA identity
confirmed.

53:11.684 --> 53:13.786
Chronicle access granted.

53:13.820 --> 53:16.656
Portal priming sequence
commencing.

53:16.689 --> 53:20.059
Countdown commencing.

53:20.092 --> 53:23.062
Four hours to
portal activation.

53:23.095 --> 53:25.631
Destination 2067 AD.

53:25.665 --> 53:28.067
Ethan.

53:28.100 --> 53:29.669
Ethan, if this puppy
still works,

53:29.702 --> 53:31.436
we can use it to get home.

53:33.973 --> 53:35.708
Where are the people?

53:37.977 --> 53:39.712
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

53:43.649 --> 53:46.118
This doesn't make sense.

53:46.152 --> 53:47.753
This is all wrong.

53:51.757 --> 53:52.992
I'm just looking at
what's in front of me, man,

53:53.025 --> 53:54.593
and I see a lifeboat.

53:54.627 --> 53:56.394
I thought when you saved me
from the poison

53:56.428 --> 53:57.562
that it changed
the course of everything.

53:57.596 --> 54:00.833
Obviously, it changed nothing.

54:00.867 --> 54:03.602
What does that mean?

54:03.636 --> 54:06.172
It means there's something
bigger at play.

54:06.205 --> 54:08.140
When this thing
scanned my blood,

54:08.174 --> 54:09.842
the light, it's been
red my whole life.

54:09.876 --> 54:12.111
It just changed to green.

54:12.144 --> 54:15.681
This one, from the skeleton,
it was already green.

54:15.715 --> 54:17.183
So what?

54:17.216 --> 54:19.618
It means the dead me
has been through this before.

54:19.652 --> 54:22.420
- The dead you?
- Every step I'm taking, he took.

54:22.454 --> 54:23.455
Are you listening to yourself?

54:23.488 --> 54:24.991
How is that possible?

54:25.024 --> 54:26.659
It's like he's my future.
It's like I'm becoming him.

54:26.692 --> 54:30.129
It's not possible!

54:30.162 --> 54:32.497
You got to bring it down,
brother.

54:32.530 --> 54:34.066
You're losing your mind, man.

54:39.772 --> 54:41.707
- Grid?
- Yes, Ethan?

54:41.741 --> 54:43.976
Does this thing give me access
to the Chronicle's data backup?

54:44.010 --> 54:45.610
Yes, Ethan.

54:45.645 --> 54:47.980
Decode the system logs.

54:53.953 --> 54:56.923
Chronicle log number one...

54:56.956 --> 54:58.958
We are at the beginning
of a journey

54:58.991 --> 55:02.962
that could change everything.

55:02.995 --> 55:04.797
My name is
Professor Richard Whyte,

55:04.830 --> 55:07.833
and I'm the lead physicist
of the Chronicle Project.

55:07.867 --> 55:10.670
We have discovered an anomaly
in the Higgs field,

55:10.703 --> 55:12.972
which might soon allow us
to send radio waves

55:13.005 --> 55:15.641
and eventually matter
through time.

55:15.675 --> 55:17.176
Stop!

55:22.181 --> 55:23.649
What makes you think
you're going to find

55:23.683 --> 55:26.118
what you're looking for?

55:26.152 --> 55:28.486
I have to.

55:28.520 --> 55:30.022
No, you don't.

55:32.792 --> 55:35.828
We have buried an atmospheric
monitoring station.

55:35.861 --> 55:37.196
It will continue to operate,

55:37.229 --> 55:38.831
and if it reaches a time
in the future

55:38.864 --> 55:40.633
when the air is breathable,

55:40.666 --> 55:43.936
it will send this data back
to us through the Chronicle.

55:43.970 --> 55:46.806
Our hope is that the Chronicle
will help us learn

55:46.839 --> 55:50.542
from our descendants how they
replenished the O2 levels.

55:50.575 --> 55:52.244
Enough.

55:52.278 --> 55:55.815
This is going to hurt
more than it helps.

55:55.848 --> 55:58.784
I can't run from him forever.

55:58.818 --> 56:00.585
Please.

56:04.323 --> 56:06.993
Log 97.

56:07.026 --> 56:09.228
Bring your A game, people.

56:09.261 --> 56:10.997
Prep the countdown.

56:21.340 --> 56:25.644
Our entire lives have led
to this moment.

56:25.678 --> 56:28.881
We are preparing
subject number one,

56:28.914 --> 56:30.716
the radio-wave packet
that will ping

56:30.750 --> 56:32.584
the Chronicle in the future.

56:32.617 --> 56:34.086
If it works,

56:34.120 --> 56:36.822
we should get an echo
with data on the O2 levels.

56:39.025 --> 56:42.895
Firing ping in 3, 2, 1.

56:52.004 --> 56:53.272
Echo received.

56:53.305 --> 56:54.807
Ping returned.

56:54.840 --> 56:58.944
Date... 2474 AD.

57:03.282 --> 57:04.850
It works!

57:04.884 --> 57:07.053
Ping data decoded.

57:07.086 --> 57:10.689
Data has been manually
overridden at destination.

57:10.723 --> 57:14.994
English words encoded
in transmission.

57:15.027 --> 57:16.929
English? What?

57:32.678 --> 57:34.213
Jesus.

57:43.422 --> 57:45.891
What in God's name?

57:45.925 --> 57:49.328
I didn't do this.

57:49.361 --> 57:52.198
How is this possible?

57:52.231 --> 57:54.333
You need to make this work.

57:54.366 --> 57:57.236
It is working.

57:57.269 --> 57:58.938
Someone is calling for my son.

57:58.971 --> 58:02.007
How the fuck do they know
about your son?

58:02.041 --> 58:03.409
I can't explain this.

58:03.442 --> 58:05.878
Don't tell me that.

58:05.911 --> 58:07.780
We all have families.

58:07.813 --> 58:09.782
It is working.

58:09.815 --> 58:11.016
Someone sent us this message.

58:11.050 --> 58:13.152
There is someone
at the other end.

58:15.254 --> 58:18.023
So we move to the next phase.

58:18.057 --> 58:20.259
How long before we can test
sending matter?

58:20.292 --> 58:22.695
We can't.

58:22.728 --> 58:23.963
Speak.

58:23.996 --> 58:26.398
There's a problem with the power
at 2474.

58:29.135 --> 58:32.238
Warning, nuclear core
power failure.

58:32.271 --> 58:35.007
Warning,
Chronicle systems offline.

58:35.040 --> 58:36.775
Archie, diagnose.

58:36.809 --> 58:40.212
Nuclear core,
cold-fusion power feed corrupt.

58:40.246 --> 58:41.914
What does that mean?

58:41.947 --> 58:45.351
The portal will not
tether to 2067, Ethan.

58:45.384 --> 58:46.986
There is not enough power.

58:47.019 --> 58:48.454
Archie, where is the failure?

58:48.487 --> 58:50.856
Searching.
Searching.

58:50.890 --> 58:52.458
Nuclear core control room,

58:52.491 --> 58:55.828
access via service tunnel
section seven.

58:55.861 --> 58:58.197
- Grid?
- Yes, Jude Mathers?

58:58.230 --> 59:00.032
Why hasn't
the countdown stopped?

59:00.065 --> 59:03.035
Jude Mathers,
the Chronicle priming sequence

59:03.068 --> 59:05.304
has commenced
and cannot be stopped.

59:05.337 --> 59:08.707
The system would reach
unstable particle levels.

59:08.741 --> 59:10.075
Define unstable.

59:10.109 --> 59:12.011
If the power feed
is not reconnected

59:12.044 --> 59:14.280
before the countdown
reaches zero,

59:14.313 --> 59:16.382
the charged particles
in the Chronicle

59:16.415 --> 59:19.752
will create a nuclear explosion.

59:19.785 --> 59:22.154
Nuclear explosion
doesn't sound good.

59:22.188 --> 59:24.857
Let's not die today, Eth.

59:24.890 --> 59:26.425
Wait.

59:26.458 --> 59:30.763
If they received this message
all that time ago,

59:30.796 --> 59:32.364
they knew about
the power failure.

59:32.398 --> 59:35.034
Grid, if we fix
the Chronicle's power,

59:35.067 --> 59:38.103
how long will portal stay open
before the nuclear core drains?

59:38.137 --> 59:40.339
Once the countdown
reaches zero,

59:40.372 --> 59:45.978
the portal will tether to 2067
for approximately 30 seconds.

59:48.380 --> 59:50.416
Eth, it's going to take us
hours to get down to the core.

59:50.449 --> 59:52.151
We got to gun it there now.

59:54.420 --> 59:56.789
Jesus Christ.

59:56.822 --> 59:59.892
Did you not see what I just saw?

59:59.925 --> 1:00:03.329
Someone sent that message
from here!

1:00:03.362 --> 1:00:04.897
That... That means
they fixed this place.

1:00:04.930 --> 1:00:06.365
That means they have a cure!

1:00:06.398 --> 1:00:08.000
They can help me fix Xanthe.

1:00:08.033 --> 1:00:11.403
Yeah, whoever sent the message,
they're not here.

1:00:11.437 --> 1:00:15.441
Why didn't they tell us
about the power failure?

1:00:15.474 --> 1:00:17.176
Why did they send you?

1:00:19.411 --> 1:00:21.814
What?

1:00:21.847 --> 1:00:23.215
I came to save you,

1:00:23.249 --> 1:00:26.385
stab antitoxin
in your dead body.

1:00:26.418 --> 1:00:29.288
But why not send a soldier or...
or a medic?

1:00:32.324 --> 1:00:34.793
Well, who else is going to
damn near kill themselves

1:00:34.827 --> 1:00:37.129
to save your thankless ass?

1:00:37.162 --> 1:00:38.530
Listen, man.
You were right.

1:00:38.564 --> 1:00:40.966
We can't save everyone,
but I can save you.

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:42.501
- Let's go.
- No. No.

1:00:42.534 --> 1:00:45.070
I was wrong.
I need to figure this out.

1:00:47.239 --> 1:00:50.075
We've got one shot at fixing
this thing.

1:00:50.109 --> 1:00:54.213
One shot, Ethan.

1:00:54.246 --> 1:00:58.183
I can't do it without you,
brother, so let's take control.

1:00:58.217 --> 1:01:00.119
We've got to take control,
little brother.

1:01:00.152 --> 1:01:01.854
I need... I need more time.

1:01:04.023 --> 1:01:06.091
So don't you want to see
Xanthe again?

1:01:06.125 --> 1:01:07.459
Don't use her like that.

1:01:07.493 --> 1:01:09.495
I'm not going to let you
get yourself killed.

1:01:09.528 --> 1:01:11.163
Get off me.

1:01:17.436 --> 1:01:19.338
Please, wake up, kid.

1:01:21.006 --> 1:01:25.577
I mean, I have never
let you down,

1:01:25.611 --> 1:01:29.181
so don't let me down now.

1:01:29.214 --> 1:01:33.085
3 hours, 50 minutes
to nuclear explosion.

1:01:35.354 --> 1:01:37.923
Okay. Okay.

1:01:37.956 --> 1:01:41.560
Okay, whoever sent the message,
they're not here.

1:01:41.593 --> 1:01:44.129
Now we just need to make our
way down to the access tunnel.

1:01:44.163 --> 1:01:45.531
We need to turn the power on,

1:01:45.564 --> 1:01:49.368
and then we'll have enough
time to find them.

1:01:49.401 --> 1:01:51.603
3 hours, 50 minutes,
tick tock.

1:02:06.618 --> 1:02:10.422
The city should be right here.

1:04:22.588 --> 1:04:24.490
They never found a way
to survive.

1:04:27.159 --> 1:04:29.261
The Earth just waited
for us to die.

1:05:06.498 --> 1:05:08.668
Eth,
where have you taken us?

1:05:08.701 --> 1:05:10.402
'Cause this ain't the way.

1:06:10.362 --> 1:06:14.132
They just died
here in the classroom,

1:06:14.166 --> 1:06:15.400
just sitting here.

1:06:17.770 --> 1:06:19.639
Everything just got worse.

1:06:24.777 --> 1:06:26.646
They didn't even
remove the dead.

1:06:29.882 --> 1:06:32.217
Does this mean that we failed?

1:06:38.423 --> 1:06:42.494
Eth.

1:06:42.527 --> 1:06:47.232
Eth.

1:06:47.265 --> 1:06:48.600
Eth, don't.

1:06:48.635 --> 1:06:50.335
Ethan.

1:07:08.788 --> 1:07:10.489
Xanthe.

1:07:16.228 --> 1:07:17.730
It's okay, buddy.

1:07:34.246 --> 1:07:35.882
Don't you dare leave again.

1:07:41.286 --> 1:07:43.622
Richard, where are you?

1:07:43.656 --> 1:07:46.391
What have you done to him?

1:07:46.425 --> 1:07:48.928
No. What? No.
I don't... I...

1:07:48.961 --> 1:07:50.362
No. I don't understand.

1:07:50.395 --> 1:07:52.899
You're going to have to tell him
yourself.

1:07:52.932 --> 1:07:55.300
Ethy...

1:07:55.333 --> 1:07:56.936
Ethy, listen to me.

1:07:56.969 --> 1:07:59.404
I need you to go for
a little walk with your mom.

1:07:59.438 --> 1:08:00.940
- Papa, I want to stay here.
- I will meet you.

1:08:00.973 --> 1:08:02.507
I promise.
Do you understand?

1:08:02.541 --> 1:08:04.242
You have to trust me now.

1:08:17.890 --> 1:08:19.659
Okay.

1:08:23.328 --> 1:08:24.964
You have to climb up there,
baby.

1:08:24.997 --> 1:08:27.532
Quick. Climb, baby.
Just go.

1:08:27.566 --> 1:08:28.835
Just go, baby.

1:08:28.868 --> 1:08:29.936
- Mom!
- Climb.

1:08:29.969 --> 1:08:32.537
Just climb, please, climb.

1:08:32.571 --> 1:08:34.473
- Mom!
- Ethan.

1:08:34.506 --> 1:08:37.677
We don't have any money.

1:08:37.710 --> 1:08:39.478
Please. He's just a boy.

1:08:39.511 --> 1:08:41.279
Please. No!

1:08:48.587 --> 1:08:50.355
No!

1:08:50.790 --> 1:08:53.558
No!

1:08:53.592 --> 1:08:55.427
Mama.

1:08:58.765 --> 1:09:02.668
No.

1:09:02.702 --> 1:09:04.837
Mama, no.

1:09:10.710 --> 1:09:12.678
Mama.

1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:15.380
I'm with you.

1:09:17.784 --> 1:09:19.618
No!

1:09:26.959 --> 1:09:29.962
Mama!

1:09:55.755 --> 1:09:57.455
Papa.

1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:03.629
Papa.

1:10:03.663 --> 1:10:05.932
Papa.

1:10:05.965 --> 1:10:08.701
Papa.

1:10:18.510 --> 1:10:21.714
Papa.

1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:42.935
Breathe.

1:10:42.969 --> 1:10:45.503
Come on, breathe.

1:10:45.537 --> 1:10:49.675
You've got to fight
for yourself now.

1:10:49.709 --> 1:10:51.911
Your father's not here.

1:10:54.046 --> 1:10:55.815
Breathe.

1:10:55.848 --> 1:10:57.083
Breathe.

1:10:57.116 --> 1:10:58.885
- No!
- Breathe.

1:10:58.918 --> 1:11:00.686
- No! No!
- Breathe.

1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:02.989
Breathe.

1:11:03.022 --> 1:11:04.924
Breathe.

1:11:09.195 --> 1:11:12.899
There, you go.

1:11:12.932 --> 1:11:15.101
- Jesus.
- I have to get back to her.

1:11:15.134 --> 1:11:16.601
I have to.

1:11:18.671 --> 1:11:20.405
I know.

1:11:22.675 --> 1:11:25.044
How could I leave her alone?

1:11:25.077 --> 1:11:27.780
Well, you did what you thought
was right, Eth.

1:11:32.685 --> 1:11:34.586
Did I?

1:11:39.491 --> 1:11:41.459
I promised her I'd come back.

1:11:50.803 --> 1:11:53.039
We're in control of our fate,
right?

1:11:56.108 --> 1:11:59.211
Just got to have fucking faith.

1:11:59.245 --> 1:12:01.613
Just got to have faith.

1:12:04.016 --> 1:12:08.187
I-I can't lose her again.

1:12:08.220 --> 1:12:09.922
This is not your fault.

1:12:13.659 --> 1:12:15.560
I left her to die.

1:12:15.593 --> 1:12:17.063
Hey.

1:12:17.096 --> 1:12:19.632
You're not him, Eth.

1:12:33.112 --> 1:12:34.880
What if we can't
change anything?

1:12:37.717 --> 1:12:39.652
Maybe it's not our place.

1:12:39.685 --> 1:12:41.287
That can't be true.

1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:43.189
There... There has to be a way.

1:12:43.222 --> 1:12:48.995
It's dust and... dust and bones.

1:12:49.028 --> 1:12:51.931
It can't be the only way.

1:12:51.964 --> 1:12:53.265
It can't.

1:12:53.299 --> 1:12:55.901
- We...
- No more detours.

1:12:58.270 --> 1:12:59.972
Maybe it's better this way.

1:13:00.006 --> 1:13:01.573
No one's suffering anymore.

1:13:04.043 --> 1:13:05.543
Come on.

1:13:07.913 --> 1:13:09.648
What did you just say?

1:13:13.019 --> 1:13:14.720
What?

1:13:16.789 --> 1:13:18.290
What?

1:13:21.627 --> 1:13:23.696
Archie...
Archie, repeat last playback.

1:13:23.729 --> 1:13:24.964
Who is that?

1:13:24.997 --> 1:13:26.032
Maybe it's better this way.

1:13:26.065 --> 1:13:27.299
No one is suffering anymore.

1:13:27.333 --> 1:13:28.768
Data corrupt.

1:13:28.801 --> 1:13:30.069
Skipping ahead.

1:13:30.102 --> 1:13:32.872
What did you
have to sacrifice?

1:13:32.905 --> 1:13:35.775
I did this for you.

1:13:35.808 --> 1:13:38.177
You did this
for yourself.

1:13:38.210 --> 1:13:40.112
This is our fate, Ethan.

1:13:40.146 --> 1:13:42.314
- There is no other way.
- Wait.

1:13:42.348 --> 1:13:43.983
What did you say?

1:13:44.016 --> 1:13:45.117
No, no, no!

1:13:48.754 --> 1:13:51.824
- No!
- Fight me!

1:13:51.857 --> 1:13:53.259
I'm so sorry.

1:13:53.292 --> 1:13:55.728
No, no.

1:13:57.196 --> 1:14:00.666
Power failure.
Shut down.

1:14:00.699 --> 1:14:02.802
What are you...
What are you doing?

1:14:02.835 --> 1:14:04.070
Why the fuck is my voice
in that thing?

1:14:04.103 --> 1:14:05.805
You tell me.

1:14:09.642 --> 1:14:11.744
Why did you hide that from me?

1:14:11.777 --> 1:14:13.212
Why did you hide that from me?

1:14:13.245 --> 1:14:15.613
And why do you have a gun?

1:14:18.851 --> 1:14:20.853
It's protection.

1:14:20.886 --> 1:14:22.188
From what?

1:14:22.221 --> 1:14:23.621
You said it yourself.

1:14:23.656 --> 1:14:24.824
This place, it...
it's dust and bones.

1:14:24.857 --> 1:14:27.827
Protection from what, me?

1:14:27.860 --> 1:14:29.762
Are you going to shoot me,
brother?

1:14:32.331 --> 1:14:34.033
What?

1:14:38.270 --> 1:14:40.005
You're losing your mind.

1:14:44.009 --> 1:14:45.845
That's not me on that thing.

1:14:49.882 --> 1:14:52.852
Jude, Jude, give me the gun.

1:14:52.885 --> 1:14:55.921
I'm in control.

1:14:55.955 --> 1:14:58.257
- Please.
- Why did you trick me?

1:14:58.290 --> 1:15:00.326
Please, please, please,
please, Jude.

1:15:00.359 --> 1:15:02.862
- Give me the gun.
- Stay right there.

1:15:02.895 --> 1:15:04.063
- Just... Just...
- Stay right there.

1:15:04.096 --> 1:15:05.297
Just give me the gun, Jude.

1:15:08.067 --> 1:15:09.802
Please.

1:15:18.344 --> 1:15:21.013
You know how my skeleton
got there, don't you?

1:15:27.153 --> 1:15:31.090
Warning... two hours
to nuclear explosion.

1:15:36.829 --> 1:15:39.231
- Please, please, please, please.
- Move.

1:16:00.953 --> 1:16:03.155
You want to tell me
what you're doing?

1:16:03.189 --> 1:16:06.225
Saving you from yourself. Move.

1:16:25.377 --> 1:16:27.079
Looks like we found our problem.

1:16:29.114 --> 1:16:32.985
Emergency reroute
required.

1:16:35.321 --> 1:16:39.825
It's so fried.

1:16:39.858 --> 1:16:41.794
We've got to reroute the power.

1:16:43.829 --> 1:16:46.532
Archie, reroute stability.

1:16:46.565 --> 1:16:49.401
Reroute stability 30%,
Ethan.

1:16:49.435 --> 1:16:51.203
Okay. Hit it.

1:16:51.237 --> 1:16:52.871
Come on.

1:16:57.142 --> 1:16:58.444
Power reroute failure.

1:16:58.477 --> 1:17:01.046
Damn it.
Give us a fucking chance.

1:17:05.150 --> 1:17:08.254
Evacuate service chamber.

1:17:08.287 --> 1:17:10.789
Eth, look out! The door.

1:17:14.293 --> 1:17:16.128
Depressurization required.

1:17:16.161 --> 1:17:17.396
Grid, override.

1:17:17.429 --> 1:17:19.898
Unable to comply.

1:17:19.932 --> 1:17:21.200
It won't work.

1:17:21.233 --> 1:17:23.002
We need to manually pull
the backup breaker

1:17:23.035 --> 1:17:24.903
while the room
is depressurized.

1:17:28.107 --> 1:17:31.310
Am I going to die in here?

1:17:31.343 --> 1:17:32.878
Purging O2.

1:17:32.911 --> 1:17:34.413
You aren't.

1:17:40.219 --> 1:17:41.353
Ethan!

1:17:41.387 --> 1:17:43.289
Ethan!

1:17:45.991 --> 1:17:49.328
No!

1:18:50.989 --> 1:18:52.524
Stars?

1:18:54.661 --> 1:18:57.029
How are we like stars?

1:19:10.142 --> 1:19:11.510
Power restored.

1:19:11.543 --> 1:19:13.312
Nuclear core active.

1:19:59.057 --> 1:20:00.660
Grid, system status.

1:20:00.693 --> 1:20:02.461
Chronicle systems online.

1:20:02.494 --> 1:20:04.363
Critical systems nominal.

1:20:04.396 --> 1:20:07.466
37 minutes to portal launch.

1:20:07.499 --> 1:20:09.435
Thank fucking Christ.

1:20:17.042 --> 1:20:18.544
Where does this go?

1:21:35.187 --> 1:21:37.657
No.

1:21:37.690 --> 1:21:39.759
No. No.

1:21:39.792 --> 1:21:42.695
- What?
- How didn't I-I see it?

1:21:42.729 --> 1:21:44.329
See what?

1:21:44.363 --> 1:21:45.832
The... The...
The... The future. It's...

1:21:45.865 --> 1:21:47.299
It's already written.

1:21:47.332 --> 1:21:49.401
We're just turning
the fucking pages.

1:21:52.204 --> 1:21:53.806
Give that to me.

1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:55.708
No.

1:21:55.742 --> 1:21:58.076
Ethan, stop playing games.

1:22:00.713 --> 1:22:02.514
I-I am going to die.

1:22:06.786 --> 1:22:08.821
What happens next, Jude?

1:22:08.855 --> 1:22:10.657
I-I thought that
when we changed my death,

1:22:10.690 --> 1:22:12.591
it meant that I could
change fate...

1:22:12.624 --> 1:22:16.161
mine, Xanthe's, everyone's.

1:22:16.194 --> 1:22:18.397
But the skeleton, it...
it's still there.

1:22:18.430 --> 1:22:20.098
My skeleton is still here.

1:22:20.132 --> 1:22:22.467
Why are we still talking about
a fucking skeleton?

1:22:22.501 --> 1:22:24.269
My skeleton is still here

1:22:24.303 --> 1:22:28.140
because
we can't change anything.

1:22:28.173 --> 1:22:29.709
Everything was always
going to play out this way.

1:22:29.742 --> 1:22:32.679
No matter what we do,
it's leading us to that moment.

1:22:34.546 --> 1:22:36.448
You're confusing yourself,
Ethan.

1:22:36.481 --> 1:22:37.650
No.

1:22:37.684 --> 1:22:39.484
We're going to go home,

1:22:39.518 --> 1:22:41.186
and you're going to shoot me
in the head,

1:22:41.219 --> 1:22:43.856
and I'm going to rot
in that hallway for 400 years.

1:22:47.326 --> 1:22:50.228
Am I not useful to you anymore,
brother?

1:22:50.262 --> 1:22:51.798
You wouldn't lie to me.

1:22:55.902 --> 1:22:59.204
Why would I? Why would I?

1:22:59.237 --> 1:23:02.474
Because you know I'm never
going to see her again.

1:23:02.507 --> 1:23:03.843
I'm protecting you.

1:23:03.876 --> 1:23:06.345
By putting a fucking gun
to my head?

1:23:09.548 --> 1:23:11.216
- Archie...
- Put that fucking thing away.

1:23:11.249 --> 1:23:13.151
- Yes, Ethan?
- ...play last recording.

1:23:19.524 --> 1:23:20.727
Please, no. No.

1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:22.194
No.

1:23:22.227 --> 1:23:24.664
Find me!

1:23:24.697 --> 1:23:26.699
No.

1:23:26.733 --> 1:23:29.501
- I wouldn't.
- No!

1:23:33.438 --> 1:23:34.874
Fuck.

1:23:35.574 --> 1:23:38.778
The second I got here, it was...
it was staring me in the face.

1:23:38.811 --> 1:23:40.512
I-I just didn't want
to believe it was you.

1:23:40.545 --> 1:23:42.581
- It's not me, Ethan.
- Why?

1:23:42.614 --> 1:23:44.917
Why wait until we get back
to do it?

1:23:44.951 --> 1:23:47.285
Why not just fucking do it now?

1:23:47.319 --> 1:23:48.520
How could you do that to me?

1:23:48.553 --> 1:23:49.756
It's not the plan.

1:23:49.789 --> 1:23:51.456
What plan?

1:23:51.490 --> 1:23:52.959
- We've got to get out of here.
- What fucking plan?

1:23:52.992 --> 1:23:55.527
If we leave now,
we can change everything.

1:23:55.560 --> 1:23:57.529
Get off. Fuck!

1:23:57.562 --> 1:23:59.598
- What fucking plan?
- You've got to trust me.

1:23:59.632 --> 1:24:01.400
I'm protecting you,
God damn it.

1:24:01.433 --> 1:24:03.201
Fuck!

1:24:03.235 --> 1:24:06.505
Fuck.

1:24:06.538 --> 1:24:10.308
30 minutes
to portal launch.

1:24:10.342 --> 1:24:12.444
I'm in control.

1:24:12.477 --> 1:24:13.713
I'm in control.

1:24:13.746 --> 1:24:14.947
This place is alive, Ethan.

1:24:14.981 --> 1:24:17.784
There's no reason
we can't live here.

1:24:17.817 --> 1:24:21.219
And leave everyone to die?

1:24:21.253 --> 1:24:22.755
Ethan.

1:24:25.858 --> 1:24:27.960
There's no masks.

1:24:27.994 --> 1:24:30.897
You can't stop them.

1:24:30.930 --> 1:24:33.700
I saved you, Ethan,
but we can't save everyone.

1:24:38.403 --> 1:24:40.640
You've lost your fucking mind.

1:24:40.673 --> 1:24:42.374
Stay away from me.

1:24:46.611 --> 1:24:48.313
Ethan!

1:24:51.483 --> 1:24:52.985
My birthday.

1:24:57.389 --> 1:25:00.592
I've made a terrible mistake.

1:25:00.626 --> 1:25:03.996
We can't play God.

1:25:04.030 --> 1:25:06.498
We don't belong
in God's playground.

1:25:08.935 --> 1:25:11.470
Jude, what the fuck?

1:25:11.503 --> 1:25:13.940
You're not going to find
what you're looking for.

1:25:17.609 --> 1:25:21.446
Ethan, no!

1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:23.049
Ethan!

1:25:23.082 --> 1:25:25.550
There is no other way.
Ethan!

1:25:25.584 --> 1:25:27.787
We don't belong
in God's playground.

1:25:27.820 --> 1:25:30.056
We don't belong
in God's playground.

1:25:30.089 --> 1:25:31.824
We don't belong
in God's playground.

1:25:31.858 --> 1:25:33.592
It won't change anything.

1:25:33.626 --> 1:25:36.495
Maybe one day
I'll be there, and I can say...

1:25:36.528 --> 1:25:38.363
say this to your face.

1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:44.971
All of this was for you, Ethan.

1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:49.508
If I could give you the life
I never had,

1:25:49.541 --> 1:25:54.814
then you'd know
that I love you.

1:25:56.816 --> 1:25:58.550
Wouldn't you?

1:26:03.656 --> 1:26:06.491
It's the hardest thing,
to admit what you're afraid of.

1:26:09.561 --> 1:26:12.765
I never had a father.

1:26:12.799 --> 1:26:14.634
I don't know if you know that.

1:26:18.905 --> 1:26:20.605
Why do I run away?

1:26:22.875 --> 1:26:24.609
I should have been there
for you.

1:26:26.611 --> 1:26:28.380
I should have been there
for you.

1:26:30.716 --> 1:26:32.450
I didn't know how.

1:26:35.087 --> 1:26:37.924
I'm sorry.

1:26:37.957 --> 1:26:39.659
I'm sorry.

1:26:45.665 --> 1:26:48.500
Fuck.

1:26:48.533 --> 1:26:50.102
Grid, dial home.

1:26:54.506 --> 1:26:56.876
Richard, where are you?
What have you done to him?

1:26:56.909 --> 1:26:59.078
Sweetheart, I don't have time
to explain.

1:26:59.111 --> 1:27:01.781
I need you to take Ethan
and leave the house.

1:27:01.814 --> 1:27:03.149
Meet me where we first met.

1:27:03.182 --> 1:27:05.084
No. What? No.
I don't understand.

1:27:05.117 --> 1:27:07.753
You're going to have
to tell him yourself.

1:27:07.787 --> 1:27:09.689
Ethy.

1:27:09.722 --> 1:27:13.558
Ethy, I need you to go
for a little walk with your mom.

1:27:13.592 --> 1:27:15.161
Papa,
I want to stay here.

1:27:15.194 --> 1:27:16.896
I will meet you.

1:27:16.929 --> 1:27:19.065
I promise.

1:27:19.098 --> 1:27:20.867
You have to trust me now.

1:27:22.969 --> 1:27:24.804
Entry granted.

1:27:24.837 --> 1:27:26.839
End call.

1:27:37.950 --> 1:27:40.385
Jude.

1:27:41.754 --> 1:27:43.521
I can't let you do it.

1:27:43.555 --> 1:27:46.192
What are you thinking
now, Richard?

1:27:46.225 --> 1:27:49.862
This isn't about
finding a cure anymore, is it?

1:27:49.896 --> 1:27:54.767
You want to escape,
just leave the world behind.

1:27:54.800 --> 1:27:57.535
There is no cure.

1:27:57.569 --> 1:27:59.171
That message was sent
by someone.

1:27:59.205 --> 1:28:01.007
There must be a cure.

1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:02.642
We have a responsibility.

1:28:02.675 --> 1:28:04.810
It's too late for that.

1:28:04.844 --> 1:28:07.113
This world is done, Richard.

1:28:10.082 --> 1:28:12.051
You want to save them all?

1:28:12.084 --> 1:28:13.219
Most of them would
cut your throat

1:28:13.252 --> 1:28:16.055
for one breath of fresh air.

1:28:16.088 --> 1:28:19.759
They wouldn't know what to do
with another chance.

1:28:19.792 --> 1:28:21.193
You're wrong.

1:28:21.227 --> 1:28:23.561
Even if we could save them,

1:28:23.595 --> 1:28:25.831
humans are a virus.

1:28:25.865 --> 1:28:28.167
The Earth will heal but never
while we're suffocating it.

1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:31.070
- This isn't the way.
- This is the only way.

1:28:33.105 --> 1:28:36.809
The Earth needs time
without us, so we jump ahead.

1:28:36.842 --> 1:28:39.946
Start again, or humanity
dies for nothing.

1:28:39.979 --> 1:28:43.916
Who, your chosen few?

1:28:45.985 --> 1:28:47.820
I know you've lost people,
but you can't...

1:28:47.853 --> 1:28:49.755
This isn't about me, Richard.

1:28:53.859 --> 1:28:56.095
You're right.

1:28:56.128 --> 1:28:58.164
People are going to have to die.

1:29:00.733 --> 1:29:04.670
It's not an easy decision,
but it's the right one.

1:29:04.704 --> 1:29:05.871
It's not what we want.

1:29:05.905 --> 1:29:07.640
It's what we need.

1:29:09.607 --> 1:29:12.712
You need to have faith.

1:29:12.745 --> 1:29:14.847
You're the scientist here.

1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:17.984
You want to talk about faith?

1:29:18.017 --> 1:29:22.121
I am not risking the survival
of humanity on your faith.

1:29:22.154 --> 1:29:23.723
Hey, Richard.

1:29:23.756 --> 1:29:24.991
Just wanted to say
thank you so much

1:29:25.024 --> 1:29:26.659
for giving me this chance.

1:29:26.692 --> 1:29:28.694
I've run the numbers,
and I'm sure it will work.

1:29:28.728 --> 1:29:32.631
I've got the design team working
on a rough outline as we speak.

1:29:32.665 --> 1:29:35.234
An outline for what?

1:29:35.267 --> 1:29:38.270
What?

1:29:38.304 --> 1:29:40.973
Wait.
Did Richard not authorize this?

1:29:41.007 --> 1:29:42.708
Is it going to work or not?

1:29:44.744 --> 1:29:46.611
I think so.

1:29:46.645 --> 1:29:49.115
Yes, I mean,
it will take some time,

1:29:49.148 --> 1:29:51.751
but I think we can eventually
jerry rig the Chronicle

1:29:51.784 --> 1:29:54.186
to fire a person one way,
kind of like a...

1:29:54.220 --> 1:29:57.757
a slingshot or a...
or a catapult.

1:29:57.790 --> 1:30:00.092
That's suicide.
You're going to kill someone.

1:30:00.126 --> 1:30:02.328
With some kind of protective
suit, they might have a chance.

1:30:02.361 --> 1:30:04.030
All we need is one person
to fix the power

1:30:04.063 --> 1:30:07.233
on the Chronicle
in the future, right?

1:30:07.266 --> 1:30:09.235
We fix the power,
she opens up the portal,

1:30:09.268 --> 1:30:10.936
and we can go safely through.

1:30:10.970 --> 1:30:12.671
The ping came back.

1:30:12.705 --> 1:30:14.006
There's oxygen there.

1:30:14.040 --> 1:30:16.308
It proves the plan
has already worked.

1:30:16.342 --> 1:30:19.311
Earth regrows only because
mankind doesn't make it.

1:30:19.345 --> 1:30:21.080
No!

1:30:24.817 --> 1:30:27.086
I don't believe
it's the only way.

1:30:29.388 --> 1:30:32.792
I've locked the system
so only Ethan's DNA

1:30:32.825 --> 1:30:35.728
can activate the Chronicle
at the other end.

1:30:35.761 --> 1:30:39.999
Somebody sent for him,
and whether you believe or not,

1:30:40.032 --> 1:30:43.202
you need him if you want
to open the portal.

1:30:46.105 --> 1:30:49.141
Can you do it?
Can you get one person through?

1:30:49.175 --> 1:30:50.643
I mean, I think it might
be possible,

1:30:50.676 --> 1:30:52.211
but it's Richard's science,
so...

1:30:52.244 --> 1:30:55.081
Can you make it work?

1:30:55.114 --> 1:30:58.951
- Can you make it work?
- Yes!

1:31:07.293 --> 1:31:10.129
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

1:31:13.232 --> 1:31:14.967
Stop!

1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:16.302
Stop!

1:31:16.335 --> 1:31:19.705
Damn it, stop! Stop.

1:31:19.738 --> 1:31:22.074
Ms. Jackson, I-I don't...
I don't...

1:31:22.108 --> 1:31:24.944
Go down with a team.

1:31:24.977 --> 1:31:28.948
Make sure the boy stays alive.
You will be his guardian.

1:31:28.981 --> 1:31:32.318
Let nothing happen to him.
You understand?

1:31:32.351 --> 1:31:35.888
He's the key to everything now.

1:31:35.921 --> 1:31:37.857
I know.

1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:10.823
30 minutes
to portal launch.

1:32:10.856 --> 1:32:13.092
Fuck you.

1:32:13.125 --> 1:32:15.294
You fucking liar!

1:32:15.327 --> 1:32:18.397
All this time, you used me!

1:32:18.430 --> 1:32:20.366
You used me.

1:32:20.399 --> 1:32:23.335
They used us.

1:32:23.369 --> 1:32:25.237
I was just a kid, man.

1:32:29.975 --> 1:32:33.312
They're still coming, Ethan,
even if you try and stop them,

1:32:33.345 --> 1:32:35.881
and the world you care
so much about,

1:32:35.915 --> 1:32:38.317
they died for nothing.

1:32:38.350 --> 1:32:40.085
That can't be true.

1:32:40.119 --> 1:32:43.756
We can't change the past.

1:32:43.789 --> 1:32:48.727
Even if we could,
what would happen to this place?

1:32:48.761 --> 1:32:50.396
What would happen to us?

1:32:50.429 --> 1:32:52.731
I don't know!

1:32:52.765 --> 1:32:55.034
But we can't leave
millions of people to die!

1:32:55.067 --> 1:32:58.003
They have already died!

1:32:58.037 --> 1:33:01.373
It's already happened, man!

1:33:01.407 --> 1:33:03.142
There is no cure!

1:33:06.445 --> 1:33:09.515
Eth, you said it yourself.

1:33:09.548 --> 1:33:12.051
Things can't be changed,
little brother.

1:33:16.088 --> 1:33:17.923
I'm not your brother.

1:33:23.362 --> 1:33:27.099
You sound like your father now.

1:33:27.132 --> 1:33:30.135
You know, if he had listened
to Jackson, he'd still be here.

1:33:32.871 --> 1:33:34.974
Only the strong survive, Ethan.

1:33:41.580 --> 1:33:44.350
So you bought yourself a place
in the new world.

1:33:47.019 --> 1:33:48.787
What did you have to sacrifice?

1:33:50.889 --> 1:33:53.392
Me?

1:33:53.425 --> 1:33:55.127
Xanthe?

1:34:01.467 --> 1:34:04.903
I am your family.

1:34:04.937 --> 1:34:06.438
I did this for you.

1:34:08.841 --> 1:34:10.809
You did this for yourself.

1:34:15.314 --> 1:34:18.317
There has to be another way.

1:34:18.350 --> 1:34:21.120
I have to stop this thing.

1:34:21.153 --> 1:34:23.889
- No, I can't let you.
- I have to stop this thing.

1:34:26.558 --> 1:34:28.527
There is no other way.

1:34:29.629 --> 1:34:31.163
This is our fate.

1:34:31.196 --> 1:34:33.832
There is no other way.

1:34:39.104 --> 1:34:40.939
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry.

1:34:40.973 --> 1:34:42.274
- No, no, no!
- I'm sorry.

1:34:42.308 --> 1:34:44.143
No, no!

1:34:44.176 --> 1:34:46.045
Fight me.

1:34:46.078 --> 1:34:47.613
Ethan, Ethan, Ethan.

1:34:47.647 --> 1:34:49.181
Fight me.

1:34:49.214 --> 1:34:51.283
- Fight me.
- Please!

1:34:51.317 --> 1:34:53.018
- No! No!
- Fight me!

1:34:53.052 --> 1:34:55.020
No!

1:34:59.158 --> 1:35:01.026
No, no!

1:35:01.060 --> 1:35:02.995
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

1:35:03.028 --> 1:35:06.165
- Fight me! Fight me!
- Please, no, no, no!

1:35:06.198 --> 1:35:07.166
Fight me!

1:35:07.199 --> 1:35:09.301
No! Help me!

1:35:09.335 --> 1:35:11.603
You got to fight
for yourself now.

1:35:11.638 --> 1:35:14.139
Fight me!

1:35:14.173 --> 1:35:16.375
Help.

1:35:19.178 --> 1:35:20.412
Please.

1:35:20.446 --> 1:35:23.382
You got to fight me.

1:35:23.415 --> 1:35:26.552
I believe in you.

1:35:29.254 --> 1:35:31.123
I believe in you.

1:35:36.528 --> 1:35:38.564
It is me.

1:35:40.966 --> 1:35:43.102
I can change.

1:35:46.572 --> 1:35:49.074
I'm so sorry.

1:36:13.132 --> 1:36:15.167
Ohh, geez.

1:37:42.454 --> 1:37:46.091
Distinguished friends,
you have stood with me

1:37:46.124 --> 1:37:50.095
while you watched your world
fall down around you.

1:37:50.128 --> 1:37:53.398
This is our time.

1:37:53.432 --> 1:37:55.100
Each one of you
has played a part

1:37:55.133 --> 1:37:57.704
in bringing us to this point.

1:37:57.737 --> 1:38:01.106
History will not forget you.

1:38:01.139 --> 1:38:04.309
This day will be marked
as the day that we proved

1:38:04.343 --> 1:38:08.280
that we will not go quietly
into the night,

1:38:08.313 --> 1:38:12.351
the day the human race
took control of its fate.

1:38:19.826 --> 1:38:22.729
I have it on good authority
that you are going to grow up

1:38:22.762 --> 1:38:26.498
to be someone very important.

1:38:26.532 --> 1:38:29.769
This is going to hurt,
but it will help you become

1:38:29.802 --> 1:38:32.639
who you are meant to be.

1:38:32.672 --> 1:38:36.174
One day you'll understand it.

1:38:36.208 --> 1:38:39.111
You will want to trust what you
can see with your own eyes,

1:38:39.144 --> 1:38:43.081
but it won't be enough,
and you'll need to make a choice

1:38:43.115 --> 1:38:47.586
about whether you believe
in something bigger.

1:38:47.619 --> 1:38:50.188
- Archie?
- Yes, Ethan?

1:38:56.863 --> 1:38:58.765
Someone is here.

1:38:58.798 --> 1:39:00.566
Who is here, Ethan?

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:10.075
I'm here.

1:39:21.587 --> 1:39:23.622
I believe.

1:39:38.705 --> 1:39:41.206
Believe in...
believe in what?

1:39:45.243 --> 1:39:46.746
Believe in people.

1:39:49.849 --> 1:39:53.352
- No!
- Fight me!

1:39:53.385 --> 1:39:55.187
I'm sorry.

1:40:24.483 --> 1:40:27.285
Incoming particle stream.

1:40:30.990 --> 1:40:32.892
Ethan.

1:40:36.595 --> 1:40:38.831
He's a liability.

1:40:38.865 --> 1:40:40.399
Shoot him.

1:40:40.432 --> 1:40:41.768
Leave him here.

1:40:41.801 --> 1:40:43.970
Once we're gone,
it won't matter.

1:40:44.003 --> 1:40:46.271
Remember the drill.

1:40:46.304 --> 1:40:48.306
We have one shot.

1:40:48.340 --> 1:40:51.510
Once the portal opens, we have
30 seconds to clear through.

1:40:53.478 --> 1:40:58.718
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

1:40:58.751 --> 1:41:05.357
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

1:41:11.631 --> 1:41:14.332
Tether interrupted.

1:41:14.366 --> 1:41:15.868
Shutting down.

1:41:25.477 --> 1:41:27.546
No.

1:41:27.579 --> 1:41:31.249
No.

1:41:31.283 --> 1:41:33.485
No. No.

1:41:33.518 --> 1:41:35.788
No.

1:41:35.822 --> 1:41:37.824
No!

1:42:12.825 --> 1:42:16.394
ChroniCorp's headquarters
were raided just moments ago

1:42:16.428 --> 1:42:20.499
after this news station
received an anonymous broadcast.

1:42:20.532 --> 1:42:24.670
Officials seized hundreds
of believed-extinct plants.

1:42:24.704 --> 1:42:27.405
If what we are hearing is true,
this may be the second chance

1:42:27.439 --> 1:42:31.711
the world so desperately needs
for ecological regeneration.

1:42:31.744 --> 1:42:34.947
Religious groups are already
calling it the deus ex machina,

1:42:34.981 --> 1:42:37.349
or God out of the machine.

1:42:40.452 --> 1:42:43.588
Entry request.

1:42:43.622 --> 1:42:45.357
Entry request.

1:42:48.661 --> 1:42:50.562
Security override.

1:43:00.773 --> 1:43:02.742
Xanthe Whyte?

1:44:39.005 --> 1:44:40.840
Stars?

1:44:40.873 --> 1:44:43.876
How are we like stars?

1:44:43.910 --> 1:44:46.578
Silly.

1:44:46.611 --> 1:44:48.513
Okay. Here.

1:44:48.546 --> 1:44:50.783
Here, try this.

1:44:52.952 --> 1:44:55.087
What's between us?

1:44:55.121 --> 1:44:56.088
Your hands.

1:44:56.122 --> 1:44:57.189
No.

1:44:57.223 --> 1:45:00.960
Here.

1:45:00.993 --> 1:45:04.764
Imagine for a moment that we are
all physically connected

1:45:04.797 --> 1:45:07.432
by the very fabric
of the universe.

1:45:10.502 --> 1:45:14.040
An invisible field
that bonds us together,

1:45:14.073 --> 1:45:16.742
everything in the universe.

1:45:16.776 --> 1:45:22.715
It's you, me, the stars.

1:45:25.017 --> 1:45:27.119
We are all connected
through time.

1:45:31.057 --> 1:45:32.624
So you see, Ethy,

1:45:32.658 --> 1:45:35.795
even when I'm not with you,

1:45:35.828 --> 1:45:38.798
we are always together.
