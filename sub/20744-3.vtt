08:35.582 --> 08:37.417

08:37.417 --> 08:39.085
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.286
- I like you girls.

08:40.286 --> 08:45.358
I think it is
a little bit copycat.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.227
I mean this
in a really positive way,

08:47.227 --> 08:49.562
which is there is--
there is a gap in the market

08:49.562 --> 08:51.331
for a band like you right now,

08:51.331 --> 08:53.033
but you've got to do something--

08:53.033 --> 08:55.535
- Different.
- A little bit more quirky.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.669
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

08:56.669 --> 08:57.670
- Because you're good singers.

08:57.670 --> 08:58.805
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.000

I haven't heard before.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.379

09:06.379 --> 09:07.614
- It's like going up
a level now.

09:07.614 --> 09:08.615

- Yes.

09:09.616 --> 09:10.617

Simon?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.527
- You know,
when I came to do the show,

18:14.527 --> 18:15.728
and I was looking forward

18:15.728 --> 18:18.698
to seeing some
of the dance acts in America,

18:18.698 --> 18:22.134
I wasn't quite imagining this.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.870
Having said that, Sally, John,

18:24.870 --> 18:26.906
you probably want to get back
to the hotel room,

18:26.906 --> 18:26.960
so I'm gonna give you
your third yes.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.008
so I'm gonna give you
your third yes.

Sally.

- Now's your time to audition
for "America's Got Talent."

19:16.322 --> 19:18.190
- I auditioned on season eight.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.291
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.093
It's never your last chance.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.495
- This is my tenth year.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.363
- This is my first.
- Oh.

19:24.363 --> 19:26.198
- But he's been here
three times.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.237
- If you don't make it
this year, you try it again.

19:31.237 --> 19:32.471
That's why I'm here.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.973
- Yeah, and it's her second time
on the show,

19:33.973 --> 19:35.708
so we're kind of a comeback act.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.677
- I feel like we've met before.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.881
- We have.
I've auditioned before.

19:38.881 --> 19:39.812
- We have.
I've auditioned before.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.180
I'm Diane Bannard,

19:41.180 --> 19:43.849
and I'm from Ocala, Florida,

19:43.849 --> 19:45.484
and I love to Hula-Hoop,

19:45.484 --> 19:47.186
and I'm back.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.188
I auditioned for
"America's Got Talent"

19:49.188 --> 19:50.690
in season nine,

19:50.690 --> 19:52.124
and I got stage fright,

19:52.124 --> 19:54.560
and I just couldn't do as well
as I'm able to do.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.861
- Are you doing
the same routine?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.830
- No, I'm trying
to impress them more

19:57.830 --> 19:59.899
by doing another one
that's harder.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.434
- Very good.
- I hope it works.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.402
- Well, it will.

20:03.402 --> 20:06.605
- Since being on the show,
I've been practicing nonstop,

20:06.605 --> 20:08.881
and I come back
with something real special.

20:08.881 --> 20:09.241
and I come back
with something real special.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.677
- Well, you do what you do--
oh, Diane.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.683
- Hello, young lady.
- Hello.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.185
- How are you?
- Hello.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.619
- Good, how are you?

20:20.619 --> 20:21.787
- Good.
What's your name?

20:21.787 --> 20:24.457
- Diane Bannard.
- She's back.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.992
- Diane Bannard,
why do I know your name?

20:26.992 --> 20:30.930
- Because I've been
on the show before.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.798
- Two years ago, right?

20:32.798 --> 20:33.966
- Two years ago,

20:33.966 --> 20:36.402
but I've learned a lot since.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.670
- So would the lesson be,

20:37.670 --> 20:38.881
"If at first
you don't succeed--"

20:38.881 --> 20:39.371
"If at first
you don't succeed--"

20:39.371 --> 20:40.973
- Keep trying.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.441
- All right.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.810
Let's see what you do.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.918
- I remember her so well.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.864
- Yeah!

21:13.506 --> 21:14.507
What?

21:20.379 --> 21:22.982
- No, guys.

21:30.456 --> 21:33.192
- I thought it was really boring
and sort of pointless.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.161
- But I'm doing
a Hula-Hoop dance.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.996
- It's a dance.
- But it didn't look that way.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.881
Looks like you were
having a fight with it.

21:38.881 --> 21:39.999
Looks like you were
having a fight with it.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.803
- Diane, Diane, hold on.
Hold on.

21:43.803 --> 21:47.106
It should be a duo,
you and me.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.774
Simon didn't understand
the neck thing.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.342
Let's show him
how the neck works.

21:50.342 --> 21:52.411
Put your neck into it, Si.

21:55.614 --> 21:56.615
- Wow.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.254
- We did it.
Let's get out of here.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.056
- I can do it around the neck.
- She can do it.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.558
- Where you going, Heidi?
- She's gonna do it.

22:05.558 --> 22:08.227
- I'll show you.
- She can do it pretty good.

22:08.227 --> 22:08.881
- Go ahead.
Go.

22:08.881 --> 22:09.228
- Go ahead.
Go.

22:12.698 --> 22:14.433
Wow.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.203
- Second round, boys,
let's do this.

22:17.203 --> 22:18.470
Yeah.

22:18.470 --> 22:21.106
- My name is Marco.
- I'm Yves.

22:21.106 --> 22:22.341
- My name is Christine,

22:22.341 --> 22:25.711
and we are the Russian Bar Trio
from Quebec City.

22:25.711 --> 22:27.213
- This is actually
not our first time

22:27.213 --> 22:28.547
on "America's Got Talent."

22:28.547 --> 22:30.883
We've been on the journey
with the season three.

22:32.251 --> 22:33.719
Unfortunately,
Christine got hurt,

22:33.719 --> 22:36.655
and we had to drop out
of the competition.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.057
- I'm ready.

22:38.057 --> 22:38.881
- On a show like this,
you don't get a second chance.

22:38.881 --> 22:41.360
- On a show like this,
you don't get a second chance.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.361
Yes, we do.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.336
- Good evening.
- Hello.

22:50.336 --> 22:52.805
- What is your name?
- My name is Christine.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.039
- And who are you with?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.774
- My name is Marco.
- Hi, Marco.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.243
- And I'm Yves.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.511
- And we're
the Russian Bar Trio.

22:59.511 --> 23:01.113
- Tell me what Russian bar is.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.415
- The Russian bar is the thing
right here in the back,

23:03.415 --> 23:04.950
the three-color thing
in the back.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.418
- Oh, where they toss you?

23:06.418 --> 23:08.020
You're just standing on a bar,
and they toss you in the--

23:08.020 --> 23:08.881
- Yep, they toss me around and--

23:08.881 --> 23:09.822
- Yep, they toss me around and--

23:09.822 --> 23:11.957
- Isn't that dangerous?
- Very dangerous.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.525
- I was about to say--
- Have there been--

23:13.525 --> 23:14.627
oh, he wants
to tell me something.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.794
Go ahead.

23:15.794 --> 23:17.997
- Well, we basically hold
her life in our hands.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.465
It's very dangerous.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.733
- Yeah, about eight years ago

23:20.733 --> 23:22.968
I actually
fell off the stage,

23:22.968 --> 23:25.037
and I got hurt really bad,

23:25.037 --> 23:27.039
and I thought
that was pretty much it for me.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.507
- Why are you doing
this again?

23:28.507 --> 23:30.910
What--what are your hopes
and dreams?

23:30.910 --> 23:34.013
- Well, I just really love
doing the Russian bar,

23:34.013 --> 23:35.714
and I just thought
that it would be great

23:35.714 --> 23:38.417
for me to get back to it
and to show America

23:38.417 --> 23:38.881
what we can do.

23:38.881 --> 23:40.352
what we can do.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.291
We're back.

23:46.725 --> 23:49.028
- Well, welcome back.
- Thank you very much.

23:49.028 --> 23:52.965
- We wish you the best
of luck on so many levels.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.066
- Thank you very much.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.402
I hope you enjoy.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.640
Because you have no net.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.542
You have nothing under you.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.744
I mean, it was fantastic.
I was really nervous.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.913
- Thank you very much.
- Wow.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.849
- I have to say,
you had my heart,

26:23.849 --> 26:26.385
like, pounding out of my body.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.486
I was so worried

26:27.486 --> 26:28.921
that you were gonna fall again

26:28.921 --> 26:32.157
like you did eight years ago
and tumble right off the stage--

26:32.157 --> 26:35.527
something crazy like that,

26:35.527 --> 26:36.528
but you didn't.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.330
It was so graceful.

26:38.330 --> 26:38.881
It was great.

26:38.881 --> 26:39.898
It was great.

26:43.168 --> 26:48.040
- That was very simple in terms
of just the three of you, a bar,

26:48.040 --> 26:50.876
and you made it
really suspenseful.

26:50.876 --> 26:53.345
It's obviously
incredibly difficult.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.813
You could have broken your neck,

26:54.813 --> 26:56.548
but it was more than a comeback.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.617
I mean, it was a triumph.
- Yeah.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.919

who this crush
is of yours, young man.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.618
- Actually, I got a surprise,
so hold on.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.881
- What's happening?
- Oh.

28:08.881 --> 28:09.154
- What's happening?
- Oh.

28:09.154 --> 28:11.056
- You want to know
how I feel about you?

28:11.056 --> 28:12.624
I tell you right now.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.168
- Hi, guys, welcome
to "America's Got Talent."

28:23.168 --> 28:24.870
- Where are you from?
- Delray Beach, Florida.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.339
- I came all the way
from San Antonio, Texas, so...

28:27.339 --> 28:29.041
- Did you travel to come here,
or do you live here now?

28:29.041 --> 28:30.442
- Yeah, like,
three days of driving.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.643
- Oh.

28:33.178 --> 28:34.479
- Actually,
this is my first time

28:34.479 --> 28:35.881
being on a plane, coming here.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.382
It was a little scary at times,

28:37.382 --> 28:39.551
but it's all worth it.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.587
- No matter
where we come from,

28:41.587 --> 28:45.224
we are ready to do
what we've been called to do.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.225
- Are you gonna show 'em

28:46.225 --> 28:47.292
how it's done?
- Yes.

28:47.292 --> 28:47.896
- Show 'em
how Iowa girls do it?

- New York.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.764
- Wow, you came all the way
down?

28:52.764 --> 28:54.733
- Yep, 21 hours.
- Whoa.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.568
- But it's all worth it
in the end, right?

28:56.568 --> 28:57.569
- Yeah, yeah.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.305
- This is your moment.

29:00.305 --> 29:02.140
You're gonna be awesome.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.242
- Go have fun.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.919
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.520
- And how are you?

29:15.520 --> 29:16.755
- I'm good.
How are you?

29:16.755 --> 29:17.896
- Very well, thank you.
What's your name?

29:17.896 --> 29:18.156
- Very well, thank you.
What's your name?

29:18.156 --> 29:20.492
- My name's Kadie Lynn.
- Katie Lynn?

29:20.492 --> 29:22.694
- Mm-hmm, with a D.
- Oh, Kadie, okay.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.029
Where are you from?

29:24.029 --> 29:27.432
- I'm from Kemp, Texas,
about an hour east from Dallas.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.668
- And that's a small town,
big town?

29:29.668 --> 29:32.170
- Tiny town.
It has one stoplight.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.673
- No.
- Yes.

29:34.673 --> 29:36.308
- Okay.
- Really?

29:39.177 --> 29:40.646
- My name is Kadie Lynn.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.114
I am 12 years old.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.150
I'm from Kemp, Texas,
and I love to sing.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.618
- She's been singing
all of her life,

29:46.618 --> 29:47.896
since she was
a little, tiny baby.

29:47.896 --> 29:48.787
since she was
a little, tiny baby.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.857
- Singing is me.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.859
It's not something I do.
It's who I am.

29:53.859 --> 29:57.062
I love you, Mama.

29:57.062 --> 30:00.732
- Darrell and I adopted
Kadie Lynn when she was born.

30:00.732 --> 30:03.835
We were already in our 50s.

30:03.835 --> 30:07.272
I would have never thought
we would have done that,

30:07.272 --> 30:09.308
but the minute I picked her up,

30:09.308 --> 30:12.644
she was my baby immediately.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.780
Immediately I was bonded to her,

30:14.780 --> 30:17.749
and she became our daughter.

You're, like,
this little, cute thing,

33:01.780 --> 33:02.948
and then you start singing,

33:02.948 --> 33:05.650
and this big,
powerful voice

33:05.650 --> 33:07.853
comes out of nowhere.

33:07.853 --> 33:09.788
You know what I really
liked about you is you have,

33:09.788 --> 33:12.457
like, such control
over your big voice

33:12.457 --> 33:13.592
technically.
- Thank you.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.293
- I mean,
it was a home run for me.

33:15.293 --> 33:17.896

- Thank you.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.097
- Howie?

33:19.097 --> 33:20.398
- When you sing a song--
you know,

33:20.398 --> 33:22.701
it's a love story
talking about, you know,

33:22.701 --> 33:24.703
an attachment
to some--you're 12!

33:24.703 --> 33:27.439
What do you know about love?

33:27.439 --> 33:29.474
But if I was listening
to that on the radio,

33:29.474 --> 33:31.710
it sounded like you really
knew about love

33:31.710 --> 33:34.179
and you have--have you ever
been in love?

33:34.179 --> 33:35.213
- With my mom.

33:35.213 --> 33:37.482
- Aww.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.885
- That's great.
- Heidi?

33:39.885 --> 33:41.419
- Well,
I'm very, very impressed.

33:41.419 --> 33:42.721
I'm impressed when I see...
- Thank you.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.789
- A 12-year-old child
on the stage

33:44.789 --> 33:45.824
with so much power,

33:45.824 --> 33:47.459
so much confidence.
- Thank you.

33:47.459 --> 33:47.896
- You know,
my oldest daughter is your age,

33:47.896 --> 33:49.528
- You know,
my oldest daughter is your age,

33:49.528 --> 33:52.197
and I couldn't even imagine her
doing anything remotely

33:52.197 --> 33:53.398
like what you just did.

33:53.398 --> 33:54.933
- Thank you.
- I'm very proud of you.

33:54.933 --> 33:57.869
- Thank you.
- Great job.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.671

33:59.671 --> 34:01.773
You know,
when we make these shows,

34:01.773 --> 34:05.410
it's a bit like
we're mining for talent,

34:05.410 --> 34:08.113
and you dig, and you dig,
and you dig,

34:08.113 --> 34:10.248
and then every so often,

34:10.248 --> 34:13.118
you find a little diamond,

34:13.118 --> 34:15.053
and that's who we found today
with you.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.625
I am so impressed.
- Wow.

34:20.625 --> 34:23.361
- Actually, from the moment
you started talking to me,

34:23.361 --> 34:25.196
I had this feeling
about you, Kadie.

34:25.196 --> 34:28.366
You've got this really cool,
nice confidence about you.

34:28.366 --> 34:29.901
Your voice, however,

34:29.901 --> 34:32.971
it's so mature, so real,

34:32.971 --> 34:34.906
and I have a feeling--

34:34.906 --> 34:36.508
and I'm rarely wrong--

34:36.508 --> 34:38.310
that in a few years' time,

we're gonna look back

Okay, we're gonna vote.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.024
- Oh.
- It's her dress.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.093
- You lost the--
oh, it came off.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.728
- Give us a second.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.163
- All right.
- She put it wrong.

38:18.163 --> 38:19.264
- Thank you.
- There we go.

38:19.264 --> 38:20.765
- Oh, she put it wrong.
It's her fault.

38:20.765 --> 38:23.401
- Yes, she put it wrong.
- Always my fault.

38:23.401 --> 38:26.738
Hi, everyone,
my name is Aura Cardinali.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.940
- And--
- I live in Sarasota, Florida.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.408
I'm 50 years old.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.509
- I'm Werner.

38:31.509 --> 38:33.344
I'm 55 years old,

38:33.344 --> 38:33.895
and I live in Sarasota, Florida.

38:33.895 --> 38:34.813
and I live in Sarasota, Florida.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.115
- Tell me what the relationship
is between the two of you.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.416
- She's my wife.

38:38.416 --> 38:40.051
- Wow.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.954
- She doesn't look too happy
about that.

38:42.954 --> 38:45.456
So tell me what the act is.
What are we gonna see?

38:45.456 --> 38:49.127
- You're gonna see something
extremely dangerous.

38:49.127 --> 38:52.030
It's so big and so dangerous

38:52.030 --> 38:54.732
that we need to go outside.

38:54.732 --> 38:57.035
- Okay.
- So let's go.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.736
- Let's go outside.
- Don't step on it.

38:58.736 --> 38:59.938
- Don't step on the tail.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.993
- Okay, so we are outside
with Duo Guerrero.

39:24.429 --> 39:25.630
Don't try this at home

39:25.630 --> 39:28.032
if you got any tightropes
in your backyard.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.168
Get to it.
You guys ready?

39:31.836 --> 39:33.238
Go for it.

39:48.987 --> 39:52.824
Werner's told me that he has
fallen twice in the past

39:52.824 --> 39:54.559
and has a brother
in a wheelchair

39:54.559 --> 39:56.127
because of this act.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.629
Serious business.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.800
- Seems a little windy up there.

40:09.507 --> 40:12.176
- She looks nervous.
- Yeah, she does.

40:17.482 --> 40:19.550
- Whoa.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.387
- She's gonna do the splits?

40:22.387 --> 40:24.589
No.
- Oh, my God.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.827
- Oh, my God.

40:51.316 --> 40:52.383
- Oh, oh, oh.

40:52.383 --> 40:55.320
Oh, oh.
- She nearly fell.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.156
- They got a chair?

41:13.371 --> 41:16.641
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:18.343 --> 41:19.911
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

41:27.385 --> 41:28.386
She's standing up.

41:28.386 --> 41:29.721
- Aah!
- Oh!

41:31.923 --> 41:33.725
No, no, no, no.

41:33.725 --> 41:33.895
- Oh, my gosh.

41:33.895 --> 41:36.260
- Oh, my gosh.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.346
That looks impossible.

42:09.093 --> 42:10.895
- Whoa.

42:12.797 --> 42:14.632
- Phew.

42:14.632 --> 42:17.035
- Backwards?
- Gonna go backwards?

42:22.740 --> 42:24.575
- Sweating.
- Back rub?

42:28.146 --> 42:29.747
Oh, no.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.624
- You're absolutely kidding me.

42:51.536 --> 42:52.403
- Oh, no, no.

42:52.403 --> 42:55.940
- Oh, my gosh.

42:55.940 --> 42:57.742
- Oh, no.
- My God.

43:03.748 --> 43:04.782
- No, no, no, no, no.

43:04.782 --> 43:05.783
- Oh.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.720
No.

43:25.503 --> 43:27.004
Really?

43:27.004 --> 43:28.806
- What?
Wow.

43:43.321 --> 43:44.322
- That's crazy.

43:52.196 --> 43:53.231
He's hopping off.

44:02.940 --> 44:04.275
- Whoa.

44:12.183 --> 44:13.918
- Wowza.

44:19.724 --> 44:22.693
Wow, wow, wow.

44:31.636 --> 44:33.004
- Howie, what did you think?

44:33.004 --> 44:35.540
- I'll tell you that I was more
terrified than ever.

44:35.540 --> 44:36.874
You got to balance.

44:36.874 --> 44:38.142
You got to know where
you're putting your foot.

44:38.142 --> 44:40.144
- It's precise, right?
- Yes.

44:40.144 --> 44:42.847
- As you were coming out,
you stepped on her dress

44:42.847 --> 44:44.682
and accidentally ripped it off
with your foot.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.050
Yes.

44:46.050 --> 44:47.418
- That's all that was going
through my head.

44:47.418 --> 44:48.900
"This guy
can't walk beside his wife

44:48.900 --> 44:50.421
"This guy
can't walk beside his wife

44:50.421 --> 44:52.323
without stepping on this dress."

44:52.323 --> 44:53.691
- In the floor, I'm very clumsy,

44:53.691 --> 44:55.960
but up there I know
what I'm doing.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.395
- That was amazing.

44:57.395 --> 44:58.863
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.331
- And I'm not being rude here,

45:00.331 --> 45:04.569
but you're not exactly
spring chickens, you two,

45:04.569 --> 45:06.404
so to do what you did--

45:06.404 --> 45:08.773
I mean, it was extraordinary.

45:08.773 --> 45:09.840
- Thank you.

45:09.840 --> 45:13.311
- It was truly,
truly breathtaking,

45:13.311 --> 45:15.947
and I cannot believe

45:15.947 --> 45:18.115
you actually had him
on your shoulders.

45:18.115 --> 45:18.900
I was like, "No way.

45:18.900 --> 45:19.116
I was like, "No way.

45:19.116 --> 45:20.952
She is not gonna do that."

45:20.952 --> 45:24.455
- Yeah, I try not to
feed him, but...

45:25.656 --> 45:27.458
- I escape in the night
to the kitchen.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.393
- Yeah.
- Really?

45:30.928 --> 45:32.730
- And you're laughing.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.765
- He always wanted to be on top.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.036
- Thank you, Aura.

45:41.405 --> 45:43.207
Okay, we're gonna vote,

45:43.207 --> 45:46.110
and we start with Howie.

45:46.110 --> 45:47.712
- Yes.

45:47.712 --> 45:48.900
- Mel?
- Thank you.

45:48.900 --> 45:49.247
- Mel?
- Thank you.

45:49.247 --> 45:51.315
- Definite yes for me.
- Thank you.

45:51.315 --> 45:53.417
- Heidi?
- Thank you.

45:53.417 --> 45:56.187
- Third yes.
- Thank you.

45:56.187 --> 45:58.189
- Thanks.
- Now four yeses.

45:58.189 --> 45:59.991
- Yay!
- Whoo-hoo!

45:59.991 --> 46:02.026
- ♪ Love and marriage ♪

46:02.026 --> 46:03.394
♪ Go together
like a horse and carriage ♪

46:03.394 --> 46:04.962
- Aww.
- Aww.

46:04.962 --> 46:06.063
- Thank you.

46:06.063 --> 46:07.098
- Bye.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.099
- Don't step--

46:08.099 --> 46:09.333
watch where you're walking.

46:09.333 --> 46:12.069
- I know.
- Okay, there.

46:12.069 --> 46:13.337
Wow.
Wow.

46:13.337 --> 46:14.338
- That was great.

46:14.338 --> 46:17.141
- Yay!
- Yay, congratulations.

46:17.141 --> 46:18.900
I mean, if anybody deserves it,

46:18.900 --> 46:18.976
I mean, if anybody deserves it,

46:18.976 --> 46:19.977
you guys deserve it.

46:19.977 --> 46:20.978
Hey, what's up?

46:20.978 --> 46:22.213
It's Nick Cannon here,

46:22.213 --> 46:23.881
hanging outside with my people

46:23.881 --> 46:25.616
at the "America's Got Talent"
auditions.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.585
Let's go talk
to some of the contestants.

46:27.585 --> 46:28.819
What do you guys do?

46:28.819 --> 46:29.987
- Well--
- Martial arts.

46:29.987 --> 46:31.355
- I actually wanted
to show you something,

46:31.355 --> 46:32.757
so I'm gonna have to ask you
to put your drink down.

46:32.757 --> 46:35.192
- I value my drink.

46:35.192 --> 46:38.029
We're gonna start in fifth.

46:38.029 --> 46:40.097
Oh, okay.

46:40.097 --> 46:41.365
- Well, we can try
juggling together.

46:41.365 --> 46:45.469
- Faster, faster,
faster, faster!

46:50.007 --> 46:51.108
- What do you think, man?

46:51.108 --> 46:52.543
- I think I'ma stick
to my coffee.

47:02.186 --> 47:03.220
- What's up, y'all?

47:03.220 --> 47:04.355
Hey.

47:04.355 --> 47:05.923
- Greetings.
What's the name of the act?

47:05.923 --> 47:08.492
- We're One Voice.
- One Voice.

47:08.492 --> 47:11.462
- We're part of a 12-member
high school a capella group.

47:11.462 --> 47:13.331
We come from all different
parts of the school.

47:13.331 --> 47:15.166
Like, we have
the football players,

47:15.166 --> 47:17.635
the academics, the artists,

47:17.635 --> 47:20.705
but singing
has brought us together.

47:20.705 --> 47:22.073
- We don't just sing together.

47:22.073 --> 47:23.874
We hang out,
like, 24/7.

47:23.874 --> 47:25.810
We go to the movies.
We go eat together.

47:25.810 --> 47:27.778
- And I win in laser tag
every time.

47:27.778 --> 47:27.882
- Oh, my God.
- Debatable.

47:27.882 --> 47:29.046
- Oh, my God.
- Debatable.

47:29.046 --> 47:30.047
- Debatable.

47:30.047 --> 47:32.183
- Debatable.
- Okay. Well, I do.

47:32.183 --> 47:34.085
- There are no, like,
romantic relationships

47:34.085 --> 47:35.252
within the group, honestly--

47:35.252 --> 47:36.454
- We're all like brother
and sister,

47:36.454 --> 47:38.122
so it would be
really weird if...

47:38.122 --> 47:39.423
- Yeah.
- That happened.

47:39.423 --> 47:41.792
- ♪ We're all
in this together ♪

47:41.792 --> 47:44.061
- We perform a lot
during school assemblies.

47:44.061 --> 47:46.597
I mean, Jeremy has, like,
a crowd of little girls, like,

47:46.597 --> 47:49.467
asking him, "Oh, my gosh,
you sing low notes,

47:49.467 --> 47:51.902
like, give me your autograph."

47:51.902 --> 47:53.671
- Thinking about going
in front of the judges

47:53.671 --> 47:55.172
makes me really nervous.

47:57.141 --> 47:57.882
- That's a horrifying sound.

47:57.882 --> 47:59.510
- That's a horrifying sound.

47:59.510 --> 48:01.212
- We get to perform
for all of America.

48:01.212 --> 48:02.780
Like, that is so awesome.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.548
One Voice!

48:04.548 --> 48:06.717
- That kind of makes me, like...
- Scary.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.819
- Freak out just a little.
- Very scary.

48:08.819 --> 48:10.755
- You guys ready?
- Ready.

48:10.755 --> 48:12.056
- All right, go get 'em.

48:12.056 --> 48:15.159

- How you doing?

48:22.666 --> 48:23.801
What's your name?

48:23.801 --> 48:25.770
- We are One Voice.
- And where you from?

48:25.770 --> 48:27.171
- We're from Memphis, Tennessee.

48:27.171 --> 48:27.882
- Memphis, Tennessee?
- Yeah.

48:27.882 --> 48:29.006
- Memphis, Tennessee?
- Yeah.

48:29.006 --> 48:30.408
- What is it that you do?

48:30.408 --> 48:33.577
- We are an a capella group,
so we all perform together.

48:33.577 --> 48:35.079
- How do you
all know each other?

48:35.079 --> 48:37.114
- We go to the same high school.
- Really?

48:37.114 --> 48:39.183
- We have football players,
people really in--

48:39.183 --> 48:40.184
- In this group?

48:40.184 --> 48:41.419
- Yes.
- Oh, really?

48:41.419 --> 48:42.653
- We have two.
- You're a football player?

48:42.653 --> 48:44.255
What's your name, sir?
Give him the mic.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.757
- I'm Jeremy.
- So why did you join?

48:46.757 --> 48:49.026
Like, don't you want to focus
on football?

48:49.026 --> 48:50.961
- Yeah, I do a lot
of things around the school,

48:50.961 --> 48:53.130
so everybody's supportive
and, like, it's all good.

48:53.130 --> 48:54.298
- You do?
Well, that's great.

48:54.298 --> 48:55.399
Are there relationships here,

48:55.399 --> 48:57.468
boyfriends and girlfriends
or anybody?

48:57.468 --> 48:57.882
- No.
- Aww.

48:57.882 --> 48:59.170
- No.
- Aww.

48:59.170 --> 49:01.639
- I mean, but there might--
there might be a crush.

49:01.639 --> 49:02.640
You know.
- Here and there?

49:02.640 --> 49:04.208
- Somebody might have--

49:04.208 --> 49:05.509
might have one in the group.

49:05.509 --> 49:07.144
- You've got a crush on someone.
- Jeremy.

49:07.144 --> 49:08.279
- Who?

49:08.279 --> 49:09.647
- Nobody else knows that
except you, Jeremy.

49:09.647 --> 49:11.182
What--

49:11.182 --> 49:13.951
- Maybe I'm the only one bold
enough to say it, I guess.

49:13.951 --> 49:16.720
- Aww. All right,
let's hear you, One Voice.

49:16.720 --> 49:19.590
- All right.

49:19.590 --> 49:21.859
- I now want to know
who had the crush on who.

It's based on where
you get asked for help.

well, uh...

57:12.429 --> 57:13.881
My dad--
he got Bell's palsy,

57:13.881 --> 57:16.199
My dad--
he got Bell's palsy,

57:16.199 --> 57:19.236
and...
it started to become hard

57:19.236 --> 57:21.238
for my dad to smile.

57:24.241 --> 57:27.144
I used to be extremely shy.

57:27.144 --> 57:30.113
My biggest fear was talking.

57:30.113 --> 57:32.182
A lot of people
didn't even know the sound

57:32.182 --> 57:34.718
of my voice, honestly.

57:34.718 --> 57:36.820
I always looked up to my dad.

57:36.820 --> 57:40.724
He just knows how to make
everyone feel comfortable

57:40.724 --> 57:43.760
and everyone laugh.

57:45.329 --> 57:48.031
About three years ago,

57:48.031 --> 57:50.567
my dad got Bell's palsy.

57:50.567 --> 57:54.404
Half of your face
just stops working.

57:54.404 --> 57:56.106
He couldn't drive.

57:56.106 --> 57:58.608
He couldn't read.
He couldn't smile.

57:58.608 --> 58:01.611
I was terrified,

58:01.611 --> 58:04.314
but my goal was
to make him smile.

58:04.314 --> 58:07.150
I started
writing jokes for him.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.286
He just sat there
and listened to them

58:09.286 --> 58:12.322
every day for a year.

58:12.322 --> 58:13.881
Then one time I told him
a joke, and he smiled.

58:13.881 --> 58:15.425
Then one time I told him
a joke, and he smiled.

58:17.060 --> 58:20.263
It was like I had my dad
back again,

58:20.263 --> 58:23.400
and I felt like
I helped heal him.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.268
- You're amazing,
and I think that

58:25.268 --> 58:27.437

they're gonna love you.

58:27.437 --> 58:28.839
I'm proud of you.

58:30.640 --> 58:32.542
- Once I started telling jokes,

58:32.542 --> 58:34.644
I'm just more confident
with myself,

58:34.644 --> 58:37.381
and he always tells me,

58:37.381 --> 58:40.017
"If you have a dream,
go for it."

58:40.017 --> 58:42.519
Here I am.

58:44.821 --> 58:46.790

59:07.310 --> 59:10.013

59:55.459 --> 59:57.427
I mean, that's crazy.

59:57.427 --> 59:59.496

- A juggler?

1:10:51.981 --> 1:10:53.349
How did you get into this?

1:10:53.349 --> 1:10:54.751
- When I was five years old,

1:10:54.751 --> 1:10:56.953
my brother snuck me
from the kindergarten

1:10:56.953 --> 1:10:59.555
and bring me
to the juggling show

1:10:59.555 --> 1:11:00.957
that was in my little town,

1:11:00.957 --> 1:11:04.026
and since then I was
fascinated with juggling

1:11:04.026 --> 1:11:06.462
and decided to juggle.

1:11:06.462 --> 1:11:08.164

1:11:08.164 --> 1:11:10.032

1:13:12.355 --> 1:13:13.856

1:13:14.884 --> 1:13:15.524
and watching you do that
for 90 seconds.

1:13:15.524 --> 1:13:17.693
I have no idea who is
in our ceiling up there,

1:13:17.693 --> 1:13:19.795
but it was fantastic
how these balls were just

1:13:19.795 --> 1:13:21.264

1:20:27.423 --> 1:20:30.059
when you want to sing
this kind of music,

and you're an old soul.

1:20:34.630 --> 1:20:37.232
- Yeah.
- Thank you very much.

"Yeah, he did it his way."

1:20:44.139 --> 1:20:46.375
I can feel that.
- Thank you.
