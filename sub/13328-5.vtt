WEBVTT

00:15.917 --> 00:18.834
Tickle tickle tickle!
( laughing )

00:18.834 --> 00:22.166
Hey Bret, how come you
don't tickle me anymore?

00:22.166 --> 00:23.792
- What?
- Huh?

00:23.792 --> 00:26.417
Oh, I'm just joking.

00:26.417 --> 00:29.083
- Tickle tickle.
- ( laughing )

00:29.083 --> 00:31.250
Actually, seriously though,
you guys are just

00:31.250 --> 00:33.041
tickling each other and,

00:33.041 --> 00:35.291
you know, it might
be nice to include
someone else as well.

00:35.291 --> 00:38.708
Yeah. What are you
up to today, Jemaine?

00:38.708 --> 00:40.875
Uh, I don't know.
Actually I'm really bored.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.542
Come on, man, you got
to get out of here.

00:43.542 --> 00:45.000
I'm trying to get
onto first base.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.041
- I live here too.
- Yeah, but go into Dave's

00:47.041 --> 00:48.959
and make some
cake or something.

00:48.959 --> 00:52.917
- I don't like doing that.
- Yeah, but I can't be
tickling all night.

00:52.917 --> 00:54.458
- I'm not even ticklish.
- Aren't you?

00:54.458 --> 00:55.917
- No, I'm faking it.
- Really?

00:55.917 --> 00:57.375
Yeah she's faking it
as well, I think.

00:57.375 --> 01:00.417
Oh, that's not fair.
I'm really ticklish.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.792
( theme music playing )

01:11.000 --> 01:13.083
( blows whistle )

01:34.834 --> 01:38.000
( classical music playing )

01:42.500 --> 01:44.500
- Jemaine?
- Oh, hi, Sally.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.875
I thought it was you.

01:45.875 --> 01:48.000
- You looking for something?
- Uh, no.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.792
I mean, yes. Yes. Mm.

01:50.792 --> 01:53.333
Uh, oh, there they--

01:53.333 --> 01:55.708
there they go there.

01:55.708 --> 01:58.375
Hey, I, uh, saw your
music video online.

01:58.375 --> 02:01.708
"The year 2000,
the year 2000."

02:01.708 --> 02:03.750
Well, that was you, right?

02:03.750 --> 02:05.208
Affirmative.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.708
- You were robots.
- Yeah, we were just
dressed up as robots.

02:07.708 --> 02:09.291
Yeah, but you were robots.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.834
Yeah, just, you know,
acting as robots--

02:10.834 --> 02:14.250
No, yeah, no, I-- I know
you weren't actually robots.

02:19.083 --> 02:22.291
So, you got a boyfriend
at the moment?

02:22.291 --> 02:24.542
Me? No. You?

02:24.542 --> 02:27.041
Me? I don't
have a boyfriend.

02:27.041 --> 02:29.291
( laughs )
Or a girlfriend.

02:29.291 --> 02:31.417
No, not me.
You can't tame the J-Dog.

02:31.417 --> 02:34.750
- The J-Dog's just...
- What's the J-Dog?

02:34.750 --> 02:37.708
Uh, well, that's me,
I'm the J-Dog.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.291
Where is that from?

02:39.291 --> 02:40.959
Well, it's street language.

02:40.959 --> 02:43.000
You know, you just take
the first letter of your name

02:43.000 --> 02:44.500
and you put "dog"
on the end of it

02:44.500 --> 02:46.583
and all the other dogs
sort of respect you.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.917
Okay.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.083
I thought it was from
a kid's book or something.

02:51.291 --> 02:52.792
No, the thing
about the J-Dog

02:52.792 --> 02:54.291
is you can't put
a leash on the J-Dog.

02:54.291 --> 02:56.166
What? You don't ever
want to settle down?

02:56.166 --> 02:59.083
( scoffs )
Me?

02:59.083 --> 03:02.000
No. Uh, do you?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.959
Oh, yeah. I do.

03:03.959 --> 03:06.125
I really do.

- Oh, I'll walk with you.

07:05.375 --> 07:07.208
Well, here's the Doghouse.

07:07.208 --> 07:09.000
Thanks for walking
me home, Sally.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.083
Um, should I come up
for a cup of coffee?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.250
What are you--
are you serious?

07:14.250 --> 07:17.083
Oh, in my-- up there?

07:17.083 --> 07:18.291
Yeah.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.208
I mean, obviously
if you're busy...

07:20.208 --> 07:21.500
No, I'm not busy at all, I--

07:21.500 --> 07:25.083
Wait, you're not still
living with Bret, are you?

07:25.083 --> 07:27.125
Maybe. Yes.

07:27.125 --> 07:28.542
Actually, definitely yes.

07:28.542 --> 07:31.000
And if we go up there
he'll be, oh...

07:31.000 --> 07:32.792
I can't believe you're
still living with Bret.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.792
Jemaine you gotta
get your own place.

07:34.792 --> 07:37.667
- You need your own space.
- We could go back to the
launderette, maybe?

07:37.667 --> 07:39.708
- Yeah, I don't think so.
I gotta go--
- No?

07:39.708 --> 07:41.750
Call me when you get
your own place, Jemaine.

07:43.708 --> 07:46.208
Bret, I'm moving out.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.583
I've decided
I need my own space.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.417
It's time to take life a little
more seriously, you know?

07:51.417 --> 07:54.333
It's time for me to look each
day in the eye and say

07:54.333 --> 07:57.375
"Hey, Jemaine you're--
you're doing this for you."

07:57.375 --> 07:59.625
- What's that, man?
- Oh, didn't you hear that?

07:59.625 --> 08:01.542
What did you say?
I wasn't listening.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.041
Oh, I'm moving out.

08:05.542 --> 08:08.166
Why are you moving out?
Is it something I've done?

08:08.166 --> 08:10.375
- No.
- Was it because of the towel?

08:10.375 --> 08:14.542
- What towel?
- Because I used your towel
and I got athlete's foot.

08:14.542 --> 08:16.750
- Do you?
- It's not that?

08:16.750 --> 08:18.834
No. Well... no.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.542
Is it my mold farm?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.417
- No.
- Are you sick
of my mold farm?

08:22.417 --> 08:24.750
- No.
- Is it aspergillus fumigatis?

08:24.750 --> 08:26.959
- No.
- You sure?

08:26.959 --> 08:28.083
Yeah, it's fine.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.458
Was it something
from a while ago?

08:29.458 --> 08:31.750
- No it's just--
- When we were at school

08:31.750 --> 08:34.583
and you said you got
a hickey from Judy Bailey,

08:34.583 --> 08:36.458
I told everyone it was
the vacuum cleaner.

08:36.458 --> 08:37.708
- No, that's not it--
- Is that it?

08:37.708 --> 08:39.250
- No, it's not that.
- But you did.

08:39.250 --> 08:40.750
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.333
Well, it was
a perfectly round hickey.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.583
Well, she had a perfectly
round mouth anyways--

08:44.583 --> 08:47.792
- It's not exactly the same size
as a vacuum cleaner tube--
- It's not that, it's not that.

08:47.792 --> 08:50.041
Is it because I drank
all the orange juice?

08:50.041 --> 08:51.750
- No.
- Is it because I drank
all the apple juice?

08:51.750 --> 08:53.792
- No.
- Was it something
psychological?

08:53.792 --> 08:56.000
- Because I put you down
in front of other people?
- No.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.792
He wouldn't know,
because he's got no idea.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.208
Why you moving out, Jemaine?

08:59.208 --> 09:00.792
Is it because
I didn't fix that leak?

09:00.792 --> 09:02.500
- No.
- Eugene: Is it because
I left the wires out

09:02.500 --> 09:04.041
- and you shocked yourself?
- No.

09:04.041 --> 09:07.291
Is it because the new
paint job's a little brown,

09:07.291 --> 09:08.792
too nouveau riche?

09:08.792 --> 09:11.458
- A little too recherché?
- No.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.375
Is it because
sometimes I'll sneak in

09:13.375 --> 09:16.291
when you're sleeping
and give you a little
kiss on the cheek?

09:19.792 --> 09:20.959
No.

09:20.959 --> 09:23.667
- ( elevator dings )
- Here we are.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.625
- Well, is it because I ask
too many questions?
- No.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.166
- Was it something subtle?
- Yes, it's subtle, Bret.

09:29.166 --> 09:30.542
- Is it because
I eat too loudly?
- Yes.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.417
- It is?
- Yeah.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.667
- I knew it. Yeah.
- I didn't want to say it,
Bret, but there it is.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.583
- You eat too loudly.
It's deafening.
- It's not that loud.

09:36.583 --> 09:39.291
- It's so deafening.
- Well, I eat
with my mouth shut.

09:39.291 --> 09:40.959
I don't know
how you do it.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.667
Murray: Jemaine.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.875
- Present.
- Bret!

09:45.875 --> 09:47.792
- Yeah.
- And Murray.

09:47.792 --> 09:50.250
- Yes, present, thank you.
- ( phones ringing,
people chattering )

09:50.250 --> 09:51.500
I'm always here anyway.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.917
I don't know why
I bothered with my line.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.333
All right, first
on the agenda:

09:55.333 --> 09:56.667
band investment portfolio.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.667
- What's that?
- Our retirement fund, Jemaine.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.333
Over the last few months
I've been

10:01.333 --> 10:04.375
creaming a bit off
of the top of the band
income and investing it.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.834
- Well, that sounds good.
- Yeah.

10:05.834 --> 10:07.917
Well, it sounds good,
but it is good.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.667
All right, I've
done the research

10:09.667 --> 10:11.291
and everyone thinks
property is the way to go.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.375
So I'm proud to announce
that as of this morning

10:13.375 --> 10:16.625
we're the official owners
of three stars--

10:17.667 --> 10:20.166
intergalactic real estate.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.834
All right,
so there's mine, Murray.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.208
Bret, yours is up here.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.583
And Jemaine,
you're on the other
side of the nebula there.

10:26.583 --> 10:30.291
But that's as close
as we could get the three
that were available, but--

10:30.291 --> 10:31.875
Who took that photo?

10:31.875 --> 10:34.166
That's the real estate
people take that.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.542
Right. How much
do they cost?

10:36.542 --> 10:38.166
Well, that's
the best part.

10:38.166 --> 10:39.959
Only $50 a star

10:39.959 --> 10:41.583
and that includes
a certificate.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.041
Here we go.
Planet Bret for you.

10:44.041 --> 10:47.291
- I hope that's-- I hope
that's all right.
- That's good, that's great.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.583
And Jemaine,
Planet Jemaine.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.708
And mine's Murrayland.

10:51.708 --> 10:53.458
I thought that
had a ring to it.

10:53.458 --> 10:56.375
Planet Murray was already taken.
I like it-- Murrayland.

10:56.375 --> 11:00.208
- Welcome to Murrayland.
- This is a waste of money.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.959
No, it's not, Jemaine.
What are you talking about?

11:01.959 --> 11:04.041
In 10 years' time
we'll be able to move up there.

11:04.041 --> 11:05.417
And besides, I was thinking

11:05.417 --> 11:08.083
two words, guys:
natural resources.

11:08.083 --> 11:10.375
Like coal, think about it.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.083
Imagine a planet full of coal.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.375
You get up there, oh, my God,
it's coal everywhere.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.583
Imagine how much
that would be worth.

11:16.583 --> 11:17.708
I don't know.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.583
It be worth a lot,
wouldn't it?

11:19.583 --> 11:23.792
- A real lot.
- What about a planet of, um,
diamonds and rubies?

11:23.792 --> 11:26.417
No.

11:26.417 --> 11:27.959
Well, it would be nice.

11:27.959 --> 11:29.250
A lot of things
would be nice, Bret,

11:29.250 --> 11:30.959
particularly
if they were real.

11:30.959 --> 11:32.917
Do we have any gigs, Murray?

11:32.917 --> 11:35.583
Uh, yes, I've got
an answer for that.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.208
No.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.542
I was going to wait until you
move into your new apartment.

11:39.542 --> 11:42.083
- Who told you?
- Why are you moving out
of your apartment?

11:42.083 --> 11:44.667
- Is it because I keep coming
around when I'm sad?
- No.

11:44.667 --> 11:47.125
- Is it because I always--
- Oh, we've been
through this, Murray.

11:47.125 --> 11:49.083
- It's because I eat too loud.
- Really?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.875
You eat too loud, Bret?

11:50.875 --> 11:53.208
Well, I didn't notice.

11:53.208 --> 11:55.375
Here, eat this.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.792
( crunches )

11:56.792 --> 11:58.834
Oh, yeah. Whoa.

11:58.834 --> 12:01.125
Who's eating?

12:01.125 --> 12:03.125
Greg, did you hear that?

12:06.792 --> 12:09.500
- Welcome back,
Mr. Clemaine.
- Thank you, Sebastian.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.792
John.

12:10.792 --> 12:12.417
So this is
my new place.

12:12.417 --> 12:14.166
This is fancy, man.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.250
Ah, yeah, it is quite fancy,
but it's cheaper than
the other place actually.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.959
Flippin' hell.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.583
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hey, Mel.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.917
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

12:23.917 --> 12:26.125
I was walking my dog.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.208
Whoa, this your
new place, Jemaine?

12:28.208 --> 12:31.125
It's crazy. I was
just walking past here.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.917
That's so weird.
I didn't even
know you'd moved.

12:33.917 --> 12:36.000
- How could I know?
- Yeah, where's your dog?

12:36.834 --> 12:39.458
Wow, this place is classy.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.083
Is that a guard?

12:42.083 --> 12:43.834
He looks like he could
really mess someone up.

12:43.834 --> 12:47.500
Is there always someone
at the door, 24/7?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.000
Why?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.875
Oh, nothing.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.166
Just making conversation.

12:53.166 --> 12:55.041
Oh, hi, guys!
Sorry I'm late.

12:55.041 --> 12:58.708
I was up all night looking
at stars trying to find ours.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.834
They all look the same.
Really a waste of time.

13:00.834 --> 13:03.291
Hey, Mel, hey, has
Jemaine told you about

13:03.291 --> 13:05.125
the housewarming party
on Saturday night?

13:05.125 --> 13:09.000
- You should come along.
- Oh, I'd love to come.
Thank you.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.834
Hey, Jemaine,
where do I park?

13:10.834 --> 13:13.750
- Can you park around here?
- I don't know,
I don't have a car.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.417
I can't get any more tickets,
mate, I'll go to jail.

13:16.417 --> 13:17.875
I don't know.

13:17.875 --> 13:20.291
I'll just leave it here.

13:20.291 --> 13:22.250
You're not taking
any of the weight, Murray.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.375
- Yes, it's all here.
- You are not.

13:26.542 --> 13:28.500
- Is this it?
- Mm-hmm.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.375
- No number on the door.
- Don't need one.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.750
This is it.
What do you think?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.875
It's not a room,
it's a cupboard.

13:39.875 --> 13:41.959
- It's not a cupboard.
- It's a cleaning cupboard.

13:41.959 --> 13:43.542
It's not
a cleaning cupboard.

13:43.542 --> 13:47.000
Is it-- what's--
is that cleaning products?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.625
Yeah, I don't know
what they're doing here.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.750
Well, it must have
at one stage been
a cleaning cupboard.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.542
It's not a cleaning cupboard.
It's an apartment.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.708
It's my studio apartment.

13:55.708 --> 13:57.542
More like a compartment.

13:57.542 --> 14:00.625
- Hmm?
- A compartment.
Not an apartment...

14:00.625 --> 14:02.500
- Is that a joke?
- Yeah.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.083
That's pretty good.

14:04.083 --> 14:05.917
- You did get it, eh?
- Yeah, that's
a good one.

14:05.917 --> 14:08.208
- Because it's small.
- You can't have
a party in here, man.

14:08.208 --> 14:11.583
- Yeah, I can.
- I'll just put some lights up
and have some music.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.250
Where's the bathroom?

14:13.250 --> 14:14.959
Listen, guys,
I-- I've got to go.

14:14.959 --> 14:16.625
Where?

14:16.625 --> 14:18.583
Out, nowhere.
No, out.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.333
You're going nowhere?

14:20.333 --> 14:21.750
I'm going on a date.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.792
Oh, okay.
Bachelor life now, eh?

14:23.792 --> 14:25.125
Watch out, ladies.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.583
- Who with?
- No one.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.917
No one.
That's not a date.

14:30.917 --> 14:33.250
That's just going out.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.458
I do that all the time.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.375
Do-- do you want
to go for a walk?

14:36.375 --> 14:39.458
- It's Sally, isn't it?
- No.

14:40.291 --> 14:43.458
Oh, Jemaine!
No, not her again.

14:43.458 --> 14:47.291
Bret went out with her.
She broke your heart
and yours as well.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.291
Anyway, I thought
you said Sally was shallow.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.291
- Oh, she's not shallow.
- She is shallow.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.166
But she's really hot.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.291
- She's the hottest girl
I've ever touched.
- Ever seen.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.291
Well, she was
the hottest girl
I'd ever seen,

14:57.291 --> 14:58.792
but then I
touched her.

14:58.792 --> 15:01.458
She's not shallow
once you get to know her.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.417
- Do you like butter?
- Butter, yes.

15:04.417 --> 15:05.959
- I don't.
- No.

15:05.959 --> 15:08.959
- I don't really
like yellow things.
- No, me neither.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.083
Hey, is that Bret?

15:14.291 --> 15:15.959
No, I don't think so.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.792
Well, he's waving at us.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.875
It looks like him,
but I don't think it's him.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.667
Bret:
Jemaine, Sally!

15:21.667 --> 15:25.291
- No, that's not him.
- It's me, Bret.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.000
- Maybe it is him.
- He's coming over here.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.750
- Is he?
- It's definitely him.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.583
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Bret.

15:32.583 --> 15:33.834
Yeah, it is him.
You're right.

15:33.834 --> 15:36.375
- Hey, Bret.
- Fancy seeing you here.

15:36.375 --> 15:38.083
Yeah, what
an amazing coincidence.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.083
- Who are you here with?
- Oh, that's just Coco.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.917
- It's his long-term girlfriend.
- Yeah, just a friend.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.708
Well, why don't
you guys join us?

15:44.708 --> 15:46.834
- There's no room, though.
- Okay, thank you.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.708
Do you want to get Coco?

15:54.708 --> 15:57.834
- Sorry?
- Coco, your girlfriend--
you want to get her?

15:57.834 --> 15:59.625
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.250
Hey, Coco, do you
want to sit over here?

16:08.542 --> 16:10.583
Well, this has been
a really great evening,

16:10.583 --> 16:12.792
but I gotta go.
I got yoga in the morning.

16:12.792 --> 16:15.083
Hey, um, Sally, on Saturday

16:15.083 --> 16:16.917
I'm going to have
a great party at my place,

16:16.917 --> 16:19.375
my new, uh, pad
where I live by myself.

16:19.375 --> 16:22.250
It's going to be
a lot of people, a DJ.

16:22.250 --> 16:23.542
- Next Saturday?
- Mm.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.834
Well, she can't go.
It's her birthday,
the 14th.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.458
- I think, maybe.
- Yeah, no, that's right.

16:30.458 --> 16:32.208
Anyway I'm having this thing,

16:32.208 --> 16:34.792
- It's a shame
you guys can't come.
- Oh, I can come no matter what.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.667
Hey, you-- you gotta be my DJ.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.041
- Well, yeah...
- There's only going to be
five people if you don't come.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.708
Well, it was really nice
meeting you, Coco.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.291
It was really nice
to meet you too.
Hopefully see you soon.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.625
- Sally, I'll walk you home.
- Oh, no no.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.083
It's okay, I'm tired. Stay.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.625
You don't want
to see my new place?

16:48.625 --> 16:51.792
I'm really tired.
Maybe some other time.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.917
Sally is nice.

17:20.291 --> 17:25.125
♪ If it's a Chinese junk
or a Roman galley ♪

17:25.125 --> 17:29.333
♪ I'll find my way
to you, Sally ♪

17:29.333 --> 17:32.166
♪ Happy birthday, Sally. ♪

17:35.750 --> 17:38.959
- That's beautiful.
- That's a sure thing, bro.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.959
What's a Chinese junk?

17:40.959 --> 17:42.458
Oh, it's a kind of ship.

17:42.458 --> 17:46.250
Oh, yeah, sure.
Women love that kind of
sensitive nautical shit.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.959
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.708
Haven't you ever
seen "Watership Down"?

17:49.708 --> 17:51.583
- No.
- Well, me neither,

17:51.583 --> 17:53.041
but women
love that film.

17:53.041 --> 17:56.375
I was just going to give her
this card that I made.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.458
Whoa.

17:57.458 --> 17:59.291
Dave:
Holy shit,
did you make that?

17:59.291 --> 18:01.000
- Yeah.
- Well, that's beautiful.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.959
- She's going to love that.
- I don't know.

18:02.959 --> 18:06.291
- Oh, yeah, she is.
- It's just a bit of paper
and five hours' work.

18:06.291 --> 18:08.792
No, that is super sensitive.

18:08.792 --> 18:11.041
I mean, that reminds me of
when I saw a puppy being born.

18:11.041 --> 18:13.417
I mean, just to see
its little head

18:13.417 --> 18:16.667
just coming out
of that dog's pussy.

18:16.667 --> 18:19.667
What an incredible
moment, man-- beautiful.

18:26.834 --> 18:29.208
- ( knocking )
- Come in.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.959
Hey, man.

18:34.542 --> 18:36.125
Bret, come on, let's go.

18:36.125 --> 18:38.333
Yeah, just a minute.
I'm trying to get
the eye color right.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.000
Do you think that
looks like Sally's eyes?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.834
I don't know, Bret.
I don't think about her
as much as you do.

18:42.834 --> 18:45.458
Yeah, that's true.
Well, forget I asked.

18:54.291 --> 18:58.375
How did you get all
seven verses on that
tiny little pebble?

18:58.375 --> 19:00.708
Well, it took ages.

19:01.583 --> 19:03.083
Oh, it's good.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.959
That's good.
It's exquisite.

19:04.959 --> 19:07.875
- Yeah.
- Is that what you're gonna give
to Sally for her birthday?

19:07.875 --> 19:09.917
Yeah. What are you
going to give her?

19:09.917 --> 19:11.959
- That glass butterfly.
- Oh, yeah.

19:11.959 --> 19:13.542
That's good.
I think they're about even.

19:13.542 --> 19:15.708
Yeah.

19:15.708 --> 19:18.208
You're coming
to my party, aren't you?

19:18.208 --> 19:19.959
- Yeah yeah.
- How you going to
get that to her?

19:19.959 --> 19:22.208
I'm just going
to post her this.

19:22.959 --> 19:26.333
Oh, where's it gone? Oh...

19:32.250 --> 19:35.375
Having a good time, Greg?

19:35.375 --> 19:37.166
Hey, Murray, glad you made it.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.959
Hey, get off my pillow.
You're on my pillow.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.583
Oh, sorry.

19:40.583 --> 19:42.917
There's something
I want to talk to you
about, actually, Jemaine.

19:42.917 --> 19:44.959
Um, it's not good news.

19:44.959 --> 19:48.208
Planet Jemaine supernova'd.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.041
Yeah, there's nothing
left of it apparently.

19:50.041 --> 19:52.250
Just a huge
gaseous cloud

19:52.250 --> 19:54.750
and the beginnings
of a black hole.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.125
When did this happen?

19:56.125 --> 19:58.583
Uh, about
four million years ago.

19:58.583 --> 20:00.125
Yeah. Sorry.

20:00.125 --> 20:03.250
Well, that was
a waste of 50 bucks.

20:03.250 --> 20:04.333
Thanks, Murray.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.500
- Hey, Coco.
- Hi.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.291
- Hey, is Bret here?
- No.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.750
No. Well, he was
supposed to DJ.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.500
- I only got a cassette.
- I-- I don't know.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.625
He-- he said--
I saw him this afternoon

20:14.625 --> 20:16.208
on his way
to get his hair cut.

20:16.208 --> 20:18.542
He said he would
meet me here.

20:18.542 --> 20:21.250
Cassette--
to get his hair cut?

20:21.250 --> 20:22.792
Yeah.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.917
- Party's over.
- Murray: What?

20:25.917 --> 20:27.834
- Party's over, everyone.
- What are you doing, Jemaine?

20:27.834 --> 20:30.125
- Party's over.
- No no, Greg's about
to do his party trick.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.834
- Sorry.
- This is the one that got him
in "The East Village News."

20:32.834 --> 20:34.875
No, party's over.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.458
- Jemaine...
- Jemaine!

20:36.458 --> 20:38.458
I need to talk
to you about Bret.
I know where he is.

20:38.458 --> 20:40.333
I know where you're going
and when you see him...

20:42.959 --> 20:45.000
( crowd chattering )

20:51.625 --> 20:54.125
- Hey, Jemaine.
- Hey, Sally.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.667
Hello, Bret.

20:55.667 --> 20:56.917
Sorry your party
was canceled.

20:56.917 --> 20:59.667
Yeah, me too.
Nice haircut, Bret.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.750
I made you this
for your birthday.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.208
Aw.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.917
It's a butterfly.

21:05.917 --> 21:08.625
I sat on it
in the subway.

21:08.625 --> 21:11.542
- Oh, you shouldn't have.
- But I also got you some glue.

21:11.542 --> 21:15.375
- Oh.
- And that's--
that's multipurpose.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.291
You can use-- use
that around the house.

21:17.291 --> 21:21.166
Well, thanks.
That's, um, really sweet.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.834
Hey, did you see this amazing
painting Bret made me?

21:23.834 --> 21:25.333
Painting?

21:25.333 --> 21:26.500
A painting?

21:26.500 --> 21:28.792
- Oh, yeah yeah.
- See, that's me,

21:28.792 --> 21:31.542
and that's some
really weird kind of wolf.

21:31.542 --> 21:33.083
Well, it's difficult
to draw a wolf,

21:33.083 --> 21:36.333
so I used a picture
of myself and then
adjusted it.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.291
Kind of creepy,
but it's pretty.

21:39.291 --> 21:40.917
Oh, I'm just glad
you like it.

21:42.125 --> 21:44.708
Well, thanks, guys,
for these amazing gifts.

21:44.708 --> 21:47.500
Oh, have you heard my news?

21:49.083 --> 21:50.375
What's happened?

21:50.375 --> 21:52.750
- Is it Mark's
birthday as well?
- No!

21:52.750 --> 21:55.583
I got engaged.
Mark and I are getting married.

21:55.583 --> 21:58.542
- Who's Mark?
- Mark, he was my boyfriend

21:58.542 --> 22:00.792
and then we broke up
and now he's my fiancé.

22:00.792 --> 22:02.500
He bought me a BMW.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.875
- Mm, Mark, come here and meet
these friends of mine.
- Mark: Hey.

22:04.875 --> 22:07.750
- This is, uh, Bret
and Jemaine.
- Hey, good day, guys!

22:07.750 --> 22:09.250
- He's Australian.
- ( laughs )

22:09.250 --> 22:10.333
Go on,
show them your abs.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.417
- No...
- No, go show them.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.792
- No, I'm-- no.
- Rock hard.

22:12.792 --> 22:15.291
- Hey, you guys want
to see them?
- Yes.

22:15.291 --> 22:16.708
No, no, thank you, Mark.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.708
- Mark: Yeah, no worries.
- He is so strong.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.375
- Pick up Bret.
- No, I can't--

22:20.375 --> 22:23.083
Just lift him up.
He's little, he's like
a pixie. Come on.

22:23.083 --> 22:26.083
Brettie, aye, oi... yes!

22:26.083 --> 22:29.250
( laughs )
Isn't he strong?

22:29.250 --> 22:30.667
What's that?

22:30.667 --> 22:33.250
Oh, that's
a broken butterfly.

22:33.250 --> 22:36.333
- ( gasps ) This is my song!
- ( ballad playing )

22:36.333 --> 22:38.959
- Oh, baby.
- Come on, Mark, let's dance.

22:38.959 --> 22:41.625
Let's go.

25:26.917 --> 25:28.583
Hey, Jemaine,
I was wondering
if you'd think about

25:28.583 --> 25:31.959
moving back in together,
because I'm having
trouble paying rent.

25:31.959 --> 25:33.708
I spent all my money
on art supplies.

25:33.708 --> 25:37.375
That's a good idea.
I haven't really been
sleeping very well lately.

25:37.375 --> 25:39.750
Oh, Coco told me
to tell you you're dumped.

25:39.750 --> 25:42.125
Oh-- oh, sorry, man.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.583
What?

25:43.583 --> 25:46.458
Sorry, she-- she said that
you're emotionally immature.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.667
- What else did she say?
- She said to say

25:48.667 --> 25:49.959
that you've
been ignoring her

25:49.959 --> 25:51.917
and that you're clearly
still in love with Sally,

25:51.917 --> 25:53.625
- which I agree with, actually--
- That's not true.

25:53.625 --> 25:56.375
She said you'd say that
and she said to say

25:56.375 --> 25:58.000
it is true
and you know it.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.959
- Yeah, but, I mean--
- No buts, she said to say.

26:00.959 --> 26:02.750
Well, did she say
we could talk about it?

26:02.750 --> 26:05.708
- She said we are
talking about it.
- Well, we're not though are we?

26:05.708 --> 26:07.041
Well, no.

26:07.041 --> 26:08.959
I don't know what
she meant by that.

26:08.959 --> 26:10.792
Can we still stay in touch?

26:10.792 --> 26:13.166
She doesn't know.
She needs some time alone.

26:13.166 --> 26:15.792
Well, I mean-- I mean,
what else can I do?

26:15.792 --> 26:17.500
I mean, I'm-- I'm sorry.

26:17.500 --> 26:21.291
It's too late.
It's over, you bastard.

26:21.291 --> 26:23.208
What, did she
call me a bastard?

26:23.208 --> 26:24.875
Uh, no, sorry,
I added that bit.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.667
- Oh, okay.
- I got carried away.

26:26.667 --> 26:29.333
I might just give her
a call about it
and see what she says.

26:30.583 --> 26:33.166
- What was that?
- Well, she told me
to do that.

26:33.166 --> 26:34.875
I was supposed to start
with that actually,

26:34.875 --> 26:36.834
I'm sorry, I forgot.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
