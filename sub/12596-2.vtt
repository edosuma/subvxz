Hey.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.758
Rise and shine.

01:33.678 --> 01:35.847
Is this what you're looking for?

01:36.681 --> 01:38.349
Motherfucker.

01:40.810 --> 01:43.896
-Who is this?
-I'm a friend of your husband's, ma'am.

01:43.980 --> 01:46.983
Was a friend of your husband's
till tonight.

01:48.901 --> 01:52.280
Till you sent that guy to my motel.

01:52.488 --> 01:53.948
Are you gonna kill me?

01:58.828 --> 02:01.456
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

02:02.415 --> 02:04.083
I believe in second chances.

02:12.759 --> 02:14.135
What the fuck is this?

02:14.927 --> 02:17.138
That's shit you need to know
about my brother.

02:19.682 --> 02:23.978
<i>So, John, Wayne</i>
<i>knows enough now to get you locked up.</i>

02:24.145 --> 02:26.606
-Turn it off.
-<i>We're all gonna get along,</i>

02:26.773 --> 02:28.733
<i>or I take you both down with me.</i>

02:28.941 --> 02:30.693
Fucking turn it off.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.783
I'm a businessman, Detective.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.452
And I need my business
back up and running,

02:39.619 --> 02:43.039
so this bullshit with the task force?

02:43.331 --> 02:45.041
You're gonna bring it to an end.

02:45.416 --> 02:49.712
And nothing happens to me
or anyone who works for me.

02:56.469 --> 02:58.554
Now, I know there are gonna be
a lot of people

02:58.763 --> 03:04.560
who would be very interested in hearing
what your brother has to say about you.

03:05.311 --> 03:08.648
Every word on that tape is a lie.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.400
Is it, Detective?

03:10.608 --> 03:12.693
His word against mine.

03:12.902 --> 03:16.656
Well, then I guess you
got nothing to worry about.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.086
<i>John knows you tried</i>
<i>to kill me tonight, Wayne,</i>

03:30.253 --> 03:31.629
<i>so back the fuck off.</i>

03:31.838 --> 03:36.134
<i>Because my baby brother</i>
<i>is very protective.</i>

03:37.051 --> 03:38.428
<i>Aren't you, John?</i>

03:38.636 --> 03:42.682
You tipped me off about a federal
investigation, I was about to get busted.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.642
And let's not forget,

03:44.851 --> 03:47.895
you moved two million dollars' worth
of coke from the inn

03:48.104 --> 03:50.690
<i>so the feds wouldn't find it.</i>
<i>You stole evidence.</i>

03:50.982 --> 03:54.694
And you lied to the DEA to protect me.

03:54.861 --> 03:59.449
The list goes on and on and on and on.

03:59.657 --> 04:04.871
<i>The truth is, I'd be in prison</i>
<i>if it wasn't for you.</i>

04:12.628 --> 04:13.713
Fuck you.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.090
You're not gonna do this to me.

04:16.299 --> 04:17.341
Fuck you!

04:19.427 --> 04:20.887
Fuck you!

04:50.708 --> 04:52.126
You're late.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.422
What happened out there?

05:02.136 --> 05:03.596
Car accident.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.557
Was it bad? People hurt?

05:13.397 --> 05:14.816
Yeah.

05:20.655 --> 05:22.281
Burt Fisher called again.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.450
Hm?

05:24.742 --> 05:26.536
The campaign consultant.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.372
Party's asking that you meet with him,

05:29.539 --> 05:32.375
so we gotta decide
if you're really gonna run.

05:35.211 --> 05:37.004
I've already decided.

05:45.555 --> 05:47.223
I'm gonna run.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.018
We were gonna have
another conversation.

05:51.227 --> 05:52.478
I know.

05:52.645 --> 05:57.775
You know you literally sat there
five years ago when Maddox retired,

05:57.942 --> 05:59.402
and you told me there was no way,

05:59.485 --> 06:01.445
no way in hell
you'd wanna run for sheriff.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.991
-That was five years ago.
-Well, why now?

06:06.534 --> 06:08.327
I need this.

06:12.415 --> 06:15.042
I haven't said anything until now

06:15.459 --> 06:18.337
because I know what you
went through with Danny,

06:18.504 --> 06:21.048
and that you're still going through.

06:22.091 --> 06:24.302
But we all went through it.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.680
Ben, Janey, me.

06:28.014 --> 06:30.182
You're here, but you're not. You're gone.

06:34.854 --> 06:36.314
Hey.

06:37.023 --> 06:40.776
I see the toll that this has taken on you.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.737
You ended up in the hospital.

06:44.447 --> 06:48.284
I'm worried. About you. About us.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.330
Just the idea
of taking on a sheriff's race,

06:52.413 --> 06:54.540
doing that right now, just...

06:58.794 --> 07:00.421
Listen to me.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.967
This is a good time for me to put my...

07:05.468 --> 07:07.928
Put my mind towards something else.

07:12.642 --> 07:14.727
I'm sorry.

07:16.479 --> 07:19.315
I'm so sorry I haven't been here for you.

07:30.952 --> 07:32.870
Very touching.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.593
What did I tell you about that?

07:47.843 --> 07:49.303
Don't worry.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.307
I'm going out to the road.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.696
<i>♪ Well, I can't remember ♪</i>

08:23.295 --> 08:26.007
Come on, motherfucker, come on.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.512
Fuck!

08:31.762 --> 08:35.683
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

09:23.022 --> 09:25.357
-Hi.
-Hi. Wait a second. You look familiar.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.942
Oh, really?

09:27.193 --> 09:28.861
Is it Mary? Is that it? No.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.154
-Keep going.
-I'll get it.

09:30.321 --> 09:31.947
-I just need a second.
-I'm sure you will.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.658
No, I'm good with names normally.
I just need a second.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.037
You okay with me dropping by
unannounced?

09:38.871 --> 09:41.082
Well, technically, I wasn't
totally unannounced.

09:41.791 --> 09:44.335
-Work's been hairy.
-Yeah, Susannah told me.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.378
You taking the weekend?
Going down to the Keys?

09:46.545 --> 09:48.255
No, that was her idea.

09:48.464 --> 09:50.382
It might be nice to be home.
Reset your system.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.802
-It'd be good for you.
-Stop. Stop, okay?

09:53.010 --> 09:54.929
-I know what's good for me.
-Okay.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.724
Time at home is not what I need.
And the fucking Keys are not what I need.

10:01.143 --> 10:04.563
All right.
Well, clearly this isn't the best time.

10:06.524 --> 10:07.691
Hey, wait.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.616
I'm sorry.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.454
I'm...

10:23.999 --> 10:27.419
I really don't wanna be alone right now.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.381
If you could just please stay.

10:30.631 --> 10:35.219
We can get a movie or we can
get something to eat or...

10:36.512 --> 10:37.805
We can do whatever you want.

10:44.353 --> 10:48.774
Around here, if you wanna run
for office, you have to talk to Burt.

10:48.983 --> 10:52.778
Burt's run campaigns for half
the elected officials in Monroe County.

10:52.987 --> 10:55.156
Truth is, politics is pretty damn simple.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.700
All you have to do is choose
the right candidate.

10:58.409 --> 10:59.660
Well, I appreciate that.

11:00.161 --> 11:02.663
I didn't say you were the right candidate,
Detective.

11:03.414 --> 11:05.666
Forgive me for saying this,

11:05.875 --> 11:09.920
but a campaign manager just seems
like overkill for a sheriff's race.

11:10.129 --> 11:11.338
Maybe you should hear
what Burt has to say.

11:11.547 --> 11:14.508
A few campaign speeches
and some lawn posters, and...

11:14.675 --> 11:16.051
I mean, this is Monroe County.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.012
We're not talking
about a national election.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.890
Well, in addition to lawn signs,
you've got polling,

11:21.056 --> 11:23.475
message refinement, debate prep,
event planning,

11:23.642 --> 11:27.563
party relations, fundraising,
FEC compliance.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.773
You kiss the babies for him as well?

11:29.940 --> 11:31.358
I provide the babies.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.947
I'm not gonna lie to you, Detective.
You've got a problem. A big problem.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.451
- And what might that be?
- Your brother.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.912
In a race like this, his story
will be a liability.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.041
We've already addressed that issue.

11:47.458 --> 11:50.544
To a small group of party faithful.

11:52.087 --> 11:56.175
As I understand it, he was accused
of drug trafficking

11:56.342 --> 11:58.719
and possible homicide before he, uh...

12:00.679 --> 12:01.680
Anyway, make no mistake,

12:01.847 --> 12:04.266
this is gonna be your opponent's
main line of attack.

12:06.602 --> 12:09.438
Sheriff Aguirre and I have had
a conversation.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.523
We plan on keeping this a clean race.

12:13.484 --> 12:16.362
See, this is why you need me.

12:18.614 --> 12:21.367
Why do I get the feeling that
you're interviewing my husband

12:21.450 --> 12:22.952
instead of the other way around?

12:23.994 --> 12:26.497
I'm just saying,
if you wanna do this,

12:27.081 --> 12:31.126
you're gonna have to open yourself and
your family up to a whole lot of scrutiny.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.800
Even down here a campaign
can be... rough.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.259
People talk. Rumors spread.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.845
One way or another, a candidate's
true self gets revealed.

12:42.054 --> 12:45.849
That can be a good thing or a bad thing.
What it can't be is a surprise.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.561
So you gotta know, Detective...

12:50.813 --> 12:53.273
why the hell do you wanna be sheriff?

12:57.194 --> 12:59.697
Cabochon labradorite.
Sterling silver.

12:59.905 --> 13:02.533
I don't know if it's gonna fit you.
Oh, that could be perfect.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.368
Or, um...

13:06.203 --> 13:09.415
This is a... Oh. A local artist.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.835
Isn't this great? It's a great piece.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.671
Have a look around.
I'll be back in a minute.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.423
Hey, is everything okay?

13:17.589 --> 13:19.008
- I called you.
- Yeah?

13:19.216 --> 13:23.137
Because a guy just left, bought a white
gold diamond halo, paid cash.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.680
-Okay.
-Gift for his girlfriend.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.224
First time in the Keys,
thinks he's discovered America.

13:27.433 --> 13:29.810
-That's a good thing, right?
-Listen. He's in real estate.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.353
I told him about you and your place.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.398
-You did?
-Yes.

13:34.565 --> 13:37.860
-Well, what did you tell him?
-I said that the location can't be beat

13:38.027 --> 13:40.029
and that nobody in the Keys
can do the work you do.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.365
So who-- Who-- Who is he?

13:43.574 --> 13:45.451
I looked him up online, and apparently

13:45.617 --> 13:49.204
he's made a fortune
in commercial property.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.040
And he wants to meet you.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.876
- No shit. Really?
- Yes.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.440
When you're walking through here--

14:16.607 --> 14:18.692
Right, right, right. Okay, okay, okay.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.945
-Right, I get it now.
-Morning.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.323
Take a look at this.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.285
Gas cans?

14:28.619 --> 14:31.580
Coast Guard found them hidden
in the mangroves west of Molasses Reef.

14:31.747 --> 14:34.708
John, that's the same area that
Lowry's men used to use to refuel.

14:34.917 --> 14:35.918
Anything else?

14:36.126 --> 14:38.545
No, but there's dozens of them
and they're full of fuel,

14:38.712 --> 14:41.048
so we're thinking Lowry's
getting ready to do another run.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.258
Or he's testing the waters
to see who's watching.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.802
- Could be.
- Diaz.

14:45.177 --> 14:47.596
I mean, he may be working
a different angle,

14:47.679 --> 14:50.474
but if he's feeling confident,
we need to find out what that angle is.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.684
Oh, okay. That was Largo.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.980
Some nut job lost his shit on a waitress
up there and they want us to head up.

14:57.606 --> 14:58.816
What do they want us for?

14:59.483 --> 15:01.568
Someone specifically asked
for me and you.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.659
This her? Hi, how are you?

15:08.826 --> 15:11.286
Detective Diaz, Detective Rayburn.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.372
How do you do? Nice to meet you.

15:17.418 --> 15:20.045
The guy that was bothering you,
do you know him?

15:20.254 --> 15:21.422
Never seen him before.

15:25.092 --> 15:28.929
He came in, he was drunk,
and started talking weird shit to me.

15:29.138 --> 15:31.557
-Talking about what?
-All sorts of crazy shit.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.852
-Yeah, so, what'd you do?
-Told him to leave.

15:35.394 --> 15:38.647
So, he went ballistic, my manager got
involved and then things got physical.

15:38.856 --> 15:39.857
You okay?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.819
I can take care of myself.
I don't need no police.

15:44.027 --> 15:47.531
-So why'd you call us?
-I didn't.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.075
You didn't call us?

15:51.201 --> 15:52.494
Who did?

16:05.048 --> 16:07.384
Ask him what he was doing
with the waitress inside.

16:13.182 --> 16:16.268
Okay. Mm-hm.

16:18.896 --> 16:19.938
Okay. Okay.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.483
He says that there's a young couple
from his church

16:22.566 --> 16:25.652
and that this woman
offered to help bring over their family,

16:25.819 --> 16:27.446
because she has access to boats

16:27.613 --> 16:30.574
and that she would be willing to do it
for a price. Right, right, right.

16:31.325 --> 16:32.784
Mm?

16:33.494 --> 16:35.579
Recruiting traffickers?

16:43.587 --> 16:46.089
He says that-- That a boat's
about to get here,

16:46.256 --> 16:49.468
and he thinks maybe these are
the same men that killed his Ana.

16:53.305 --> 16:54.515
Tell him we'll take care of it.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.850
You gotta let-- Tell him
he's gotta let us do our work.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.269
- Mm-hm.
- Make sure he understands that.

16:59.436 --> 17:03.440
And again, I'm sorry for the loss
of your daughter.

17:14.785 --> 17:16.870
Get him a coffee, okay?

17:18.580 --> 17:21.458
I know. Can you believe
the fucking timing of this shit?

17:22.751 --> 17:25.712
You know, if she's recruiting,
that means Grunwald's right.

17:25.879 --> 17:28.632
Lowry's getting ready to do another run.
Let's bring her in, John.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.467
You think she's working for Lowry?

17:30.634 --> 17:32.261
Could be.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.014
-What, off this guy's word?
-Run her through the system.

17:36.265 --> 17:38.016
I'm sure we'll find something.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.229
Did I just hear you say that?

17:42.437 --> 17:46.984
This is our chance to get Lowry.
Do we really wanna fuck that up? Hm?

18:30.652 --> 18:32.613
Detective Rayburn.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.615
I'm afraid Miss Cortez can't help you.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.327
-Who are you?
-Miss Cortez's attorney.

18:38.493 --> 18:39.745
She has nothing to say.

18:41.163 --> 18:44.541
Usually when you guys pop up
this quick, the clients have a lot to say.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.085
-Are you charging her with something?
-I don't need to.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.212
She's got pending charges
and a bench warrant

18:49.379 --> 18:50.922
for missing her last court appearance.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.091
Well, then I'm here to bail her out.

18:53.759 --> 18:54.968
Why don't you take a seat,

18:55.093 --> 18:57.638
because she's gotta be processed
and go in front of the judge.

18:57.971 --> 19:02.392
For your own sake, I'd encourage you
to stop what you're doing and let her go.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.565
And why would I do that?

19:09.775 --> 19:13.070
Because Miss Cortez is prepared
to provide information on another case.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.447
A case Wayne Lowry is certain

19:15.572 --> 19:18.325
that you don't want
the district attorney reopening.

19:18.742 --> 19:22.162
<i>I represented Carlos</i>
<i>Mejia on an aggravated assault charge.</i>

19:22.329 --> 19:24.081
Was there anything unusual
about the case?

19:24.623 --> 19:27.042
-Unusual how?
-Just tell me, Meg.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.252
Was there anything at all
off about the case?

19:29.878 --> 19:33.006
I mean, a witness dropped out,
but so what?

19:33.298 --> 19:34.716
Why did the witness drop out?

19:35.676 --> 19:37.803
Because I tripped him up on cross.

19:38.512 --> 19:42.015
-You're sure that's why?
-<i>That's what the ADA told me.</i>

19:42.891 --> 19:48.313
He takes back his testimony and then
the case against Carlos is dropped?

19:48.522 --> 19:50.232
John, what's the issue?
What's going on?

19:50.399 --> 19:53.735
-<i>I need you to come home.</i>
-No, I can't.

19:53.944 --> 19:56.738
No-- No, you don't have a choice.
I need you here.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.867
You're freaking me out, John.
What's going on?

20:01.201 --> 20:02.744
Am I in some kind of trouble?

20:02.828 --> 20:05.288
I don't know. You need to be here.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.457
Listen to me.

20:07.624 --> 20:11.586
I mean as soon as fucking possible.
Do you understand?

20:44.578 --> 20:45.954
-Kevin?
-Mr. Garnet.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.539
-Yeah.
-Hi, it's a pleasure.

20:47.622 --> 20:50.167
-Yeah, come on. Have a seat.
-Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.461
Would you give me a second?
I gotta talk to Kevin here.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.338
-Hi.
-Glad you could come up.

20:56.882 --> 20:58.675
I really appreciate you meeting me.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.845
Absolutely. Like I told your wife,
I'm always looking for opportunities.

21:02.053 --> 21:05.557
Well, I tell you what. I've got a
once-in-a-lifetimer with this new marina.

21:05.640 --> 21:09.269
And I got it because my family
has been down here a long time.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.188
Yeah, your wife said almost 50 years?

21:11.271 --> 21:14.566
That's right. People know me, you know?
They trust me to turn it into

21:14.649 --> 21:17.235
a mixed-use facility that'll make money,

21:17.319 --> 21:20.405
but also won't look like fucking Vegas
on the water. Know what I mean?

21:21.782 --> 21:23.158
So, what do you have for me?

21:25.202 --> 21:27.788
People come to the Keys because
it's one of the most unique places

21:27.871 --> 21:29.039
in the entire world, right?

21:29.122 --> 21:31.833
They wanna come and they wanna
experience that beauty,

21:31.917 --> 21:36.379
but they want it unspoiled.
They want it, uh... pure.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.256
But they also want comfort
and service, right?

21:38.340 --> 21:43.345
I wanna build a state-of-the-art
stowage and docking program.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.681
Fishing charters, boat tours,
off-season storage. Uh...

21:46.765 --> 21:48.975
-Like, a beautiful boutique retail space--
-Kevin, look.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.354
Everything that you're saying,
I love it, man. Okay?

21:52.437 --> 21:53.855
Have you had a pro-forma done?

21:54.022 --> 21:56.983
-Uh, you mean like a business plan?
-Yeah. Yeah, essentially.

21:57.108 --> 22:00.654
But you also wanna detail things like your
build-up costs, your seasonal sales rates.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.864
Yeah, I mean, like,
I have financials.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.953
Sure, but I mean, what does that mean
for a mixed-use marina, right?

22:08.036 --> 22:09.913
Right, exactly. Exactly.

22:10.205 --> 22:13.625
And I imagine that you've accounted for
your seasonal contingencies

22:13.834 --> 22:16.837
-and your impact fees on a per seat basis?
-Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

22:17.295 --> 22:18.338
Good.

22:19.172 --> 22:22.843
So, can you tell me something about how
you've budgeted for your holding costs?

22:24.636 --> 22:26.054
Um...

22:26.513 --> 22:27.472
My what?

22:33.687 --> 22:34.938
Fuck!

22:38.441 --> 22:40.360
You're such a fucking idiot!

22:51.621 --> 22:53.331
Um, uh...

22:53.498 --> 22:55.000
Hang on a second, please.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.503
What the fuck, man?
I said give me a second.

22:58.587 --> 22:59.796
Easy, brother.

23:00.255 --> 23:03.174
To party alone is bad luck.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.343
Uh, okay.

23:06.845 --> 23:09.264
Um, yeah, okay. Okay.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.604
Ahh...

23:15.729 --> 23:16.646
Snow this good?

23:16.730 --> 23:20.817
I have some brethrens willing
to scare up significant funds for that.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.696
No, no. No-- Dude, I don't--

23:24.779 --> 23:25.947
I don't sell it.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.783
Come on, Frosty.
Hook a brother up, man.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.118
Um...

23:30.285 --> 23:32.078
No, no, man, I'm sorry.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.371
I don't-- I don't--

23:33.747 --> 23:36.708
Thank you, though, for the offer. Here.

23:44.007 --> 23:48.011
Ahh. Damn, Frosty, that's good.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.434
I was very sorry to hear about Danny.

23:54.643 --> 23:58.438
- I really liked him.
- Yeah, thank you.

23:58.647 --> 24:00.607
I appreciate that.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.943
The cops are all done with his things.

24:04.653 --> 24:06.738
-Thank you.
-Sure thing, ma'am.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.865
-Take your time.
-Okay.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.455
What did the landlord say?

25:38.955 --> 25:41.916
He remembers letting John in
a few months ago.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.796
-So he was here more than once?
-Yes.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.257
You're certain?

25:50.425 --> 25:51.718
I am now.

25:53.344 --> 25:56.806
Though I don't think John
mentioned any of it to the police.

26:23.249 --> 26:28.671
- Do you need help with your bags?
- No, thanks. I got it.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.282
<i>I don't understand what you're saying.</i>

26:56.407 --> 26:58.576
Her lawyer's
trying to use me as leverage?

26:58.660 --> 27:00.578
He says that your witness
was tampered with.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.330
That's not true. It never happened.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.750
He was. It did happen.
I talked to the witness.

27:05.834 --> 27:08.211
Wayne Lowry's people got to him
and they paid him off.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.964
-That's why he recanted?
-There's more.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.549
The money came from Mom.

27:13.216 --> 27:15.385
Yeah, Carlos worked at the inn.
She paid him every week.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.595
Mom paid with a personal check.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.473
Oh, shit. That's right.
She gave him money for bail.

27:20.974 --> 27:23.810
Danny had Carlos sign over that check.

27:24.060 --> 27:26.104
So, it wasn't enough for him
to fuck with my case,

27:26.187 --> 27:28.481
he had to create a fucking paper trail?

27:29.858 --> 27:31.651
Jesus Christ.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.946
Why is this all coming out now?

27:36.239 --> 27:39.158
The lawyer of the woman we arrested
was sent by Lowry.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.160
Why would he do that?

27:41.619 --> 27:43.788
Why would Lowry
know anything about this?

27:45.081 --> 27:46.082
Danny.

27:47.458 --> 27:48.543
Danny what?

27:49.127 --> 27:51.254
Danny told him?

27:53.506 --> 27:56.634
I think we have to assume
that Danny told him everything.

27:57.677 --> 28:01.222
So, he knows that you lied to the DEA?
He knows that we hid the drugs?

28:01.347 --> 28:04.058
-My word against his.
-Jesus Christ.

28:05.143 --> 28:06.519
-This is all about Danny still.
-Meg--

28:06.686 --> 28:09.355
He won't fucking go away.

28:20.074 --> 28:22.327
Mom's gonna be involved. And me.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.079
-Neither of you did anything wrong.
-Are you fucking crazy?

28:25.288 --> 28:27.707
I've tried one criminal case
in my entire life

28:27.790 --> 28:29.876
and now it looks like I bribed a witness

28:30.001 --> 28:33.588
with a personal check
for the sole purpose of running drugs

28:33.671 --> 28:35.048
through my family's business.

28:35.131 --> 28:39.928
Listen to me. Wayne Lowry
is the only fucking person

28:40.261 --> 28:43.181
that has a motive for killing Danny.
The only one.

28:45.808 --> 28:48.436
We have to shut this down.
Do you understand that?

28:48.519 --> 28:49.354
How?

28:50.355 --> 28:52.482
We find Carlos. Carlos is the one person

28:52.565 --> 28:54.525
that knows that
you did not do anything wrong.

28:54.859 --> 28:56.694
Where the fuck are we gonna find him?

28:57.278 --> 28:59.405
You said the DEA
doesn't know where he is.

28:59.697 --> 29:02.033
The DEA doesn't know where he is.
But I do.

29:09.582 --> 29:12.001
Hi, I'm--
I'm just here looking for Carlos Mejia.

29:12.543 --> 29:16.047
-What's your name?
-Meg Rayburn. I'm his lawyer.

29:18.508 --> 29:19.968
Is Carlos here?

29:20.051 --> 29:22.679
No. A few nights ago,
he picked up his shit and took off.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.807
Okay, is there any chance
that you could get a message to him?

29:26.224 --> 29:28.559
Depends. What's the message?

29:28.935 --> 29:31.312
Did he ever tell you about
my brother John Rayburn?

29:31.688 --> 29:33.147
-The cop?
-Yeah.

29:33.231 --> 29:34.107
No, no, no.

29:34.190 --> 29:37.026
Carlos isn't in trouble.
He just needs to talk to my brother.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.152
About what?

29:39.862 --> 29:42.782
You know, my family's helped Carlos a lot,
and now we need him to help us,

29:42.865 --> 29:45.451
so if you could just tell him
to contact my brother.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.745
I don't even know
if I'll hear from him again.

29:47.954 --> 29:51.207
-But if you do?
-If I do, I'll tell him you came by.

30:00.925 --> 30:04.178
Hey, hey. Jake the Snake, man.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.723
-Hey, Kev.
-Hey.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.474
Listen, um...

30:10.310 --> 30:13.771
I'm sorry, but I'm leaving.
Just come to say goodbye.

30:14.063 --> 30:18.568
Come on, man. You can't be serious.
Come on.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.903
I swear to you,
every fucking cent I owe you,

30:20.987 --> 30:23.531
-you're gonna get it. With interest.
-Kevin. You gotta stop. No--

30:23.614 --> 30:24.657
Don't worry about all that.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.826
Listen, anything
that you can find. All right?

30:26.909 --> 30:30.663
Go around my yard, anything you find,
you take it as collateral.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.915
I just gotta feed my family, Kev.
You understand.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.335
You waited this long already, man.
Come on.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.381
We had a good run, didn't we?

30:42.633 --> 30:43.801
But I'm done.

30:46.637 --> 30:49.057
I'm gonna take care of you, Jake.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.144
You're not gonna shake my hand, Kevin?

30:53.269 --> 30:56.189
Don't do this to me. Don't--
Please don't do this to me right now.

30:56.439 --> 30:59.484
Come on. You're all I got, man.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.652
-Good luck, brother.
-Jake.

31:02.612 --> 31:03.529
Jake.

31:06.699 --> 31:07.742
Jake.

31:47.865 --> 31:52.036
Len.
I heard you were here. How are you?

31:52.829 --> 31:55.331
I can't get enough, I guess, John.

31:55.790 --> 31:57.834
Had a hell of a fight
with a sailfish yesterday.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.460
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

31:59.669 --> 32:02.296
Well, hell, this time of year,
you'd probably have more luck down--

32:02.380 --> 32:04.340
-Down around Key West, I'd think.
-Yeah.

32:04.465 --> 32:05.842
-There's too many tourists.
-Ah.

32:06.134 --> 32:10.054
I'd rather stick around here
and see what I can find.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.683
How long you planning on staying?

32:15.726 --> 32:19.605
As long as it takes
until I can catch a big one.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.735
Goddamn if you don't put on a good act.

32:25.361 --> 32:28.865
I mean, you-- You act like you have
my family's best interests in mind...

32:31.284 --> 32:34.162
But if you did, you wouldn't have
given Danny those tapes, Len.

32:40.168 --> 32:41.210
Well, John...

32:42.795 --> 32:44.672
I'm not sure that I agree with you.

32:44.881 --> 32:46.632
Your guilt from the past...

32:48.050 --> 32:49.844
That's why you're here.

33:00.771 --> 33:02.023
Why don't you leave it alone?

33:03.274 --> 33:05.151
Why don't you leave my family alone?

33:06.152 --> 33:07.236
Please.

33:14.744 --> 33:15.912
All right.

33:20.791 --> 33:22.585
His name is Nolan.

33:25.004 --> 33:28.799
And I didn't wanna say anything
until I was sure.

33:34.805 --> 33:35.765
Mom.

33:38.434 --> 33:39.727
Are you sure?

33:42.355 --> 33:44.357
When you meet him, you'll see.

33:48.611 --> 33:50.863
Did Danny talk to him about us?

33:53.491 --> 33:55.034
It seems he did.

33:55.576 --> 33:57.036
What does he know?

34:00.248 --> 34:01.874
What do you mean?

34:05.920 --> 34:07.672
Did you meet his mother?

34:09.006 --> 34:11.008
Still trying to track her down.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.520
Do you wanna meet him, Mom?

34:27.650 --> 34:29.193
If I do...

34:30.778 --> 34:32.863
what am I supposed to tell him?

34:36.909 --> 34:38.119
About what?

34:40.621 --> 34:42.164
About everything.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.173
I hope you're getting
some much-needed R and R.

34:51.257 --> 34:54.552
- You get down to the Keys?
<i>- Yeah, I did. It's great.</i>

34:54.927 --> 34:57.054
It was a great idea. Thank you for that.

34:57.430 --> 35:00.391
Good. You using the time to
clear your head and get your focus back?

35:00.600 --> 35:04.145
Yeah. That's what I'm doing.
That's what you said to do.

35:04.937 --> 35:07.064
Okay, good. Because the Pell case
is going to trial.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.774
I need you back and on your game.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.484
<i>How soon can you travel?</i>

35:10.735 --> 35:12.445
Uh, can you give me one more day?

35:12.945 --> 35:14.697
Okay. See you then.

35:24.248 --> 35:25.291
Hello?

35:38.387 --> 35:39.430
John?

35:53.277 --> 35:54.737
Miss Rayburn?

35:54.820 --> 35:57.740
Jesus Christ. You stay right there.

35:59.408 --> 36:01.077
Why were you looking for me?

36:05.122 --> 36:07.041
I just wanted to talk to you.

36:09.919 --> 36:12.588
I know the truth about your case.

36:13.255 --> 36:15.508
I know what you and Danny
did to that witness.

36:16.008 --> 36:18.427
I'm so sorry, Miss Rayburn. I mean,

36:18.511 --> 36:21.681
you trusted me and you helped me.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.225
I know about the drugs, too.

36:24.809 --> 36:26.852
I never meant
for anything bad to happen.

36:26.936 --> 36:29.230
And I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

36:32.274 --> 36:35.194
So, I talked to my brother John
and he's willing to help you.

36:35.945 --> 36:38.572
You just have to go in there
and tell him the truth.

36:38.739 --> 36:40.366
There are men that are trying to kill me.

36:40.533 --> 36:43.703
-Lowry's men.
-I know. He can protect you.

36:47.748 --> 36:50.501
Just talk to John.
Can you do that, please?

37:03.556 --> 37:05.349
Come on, baby.

37:07.518 --> 37:09.729
<i>Bravo 4, are you located</i>

37:09.895 --> 37:11.814
<i>anywhere near the Marathon Minimart?</i>

37:12.648 --> 37:15.609
- This better be fucking good.
- We're sorry to bother you, Judge,

37:15.693 --> 37:17.737
but we have an affidavit
for a search warrant

37:17.820 --> 37:19.029
that needs impartial eyes.

37:19.196 --> 37:21.449
Oh, well, that's cute, detective.

37:21.782 --> 37:24.535
I tell you what these impartial eyes
are seeing.

37:25.411 --> 37:27.913
You two got shot down
by the judge on duty

37:27.997 --> 37:32.877
and decided to come all the way out here
and ruin my day off.

37:35.588 --> 37:37.923
Is this regarding your brother's murder?

37:38.299 --> 37:41.385
Yes, sir. We've picked up a woman.

37:41.469 --> 37:44.638
We suspect that she's a recruiter
for Wayne Lowry's trafficking ring.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.098
You suspect how?

37:46.307 --> 37:48.309
An immigrant couple ID'd her
off a six pack.

37:48.392 --> 37:50.811
They were looking to bring
their sick mother up from Honduras.

37:50.895 --> 37:52.730
They've already given a $2500 deposit.

37:52.897 --> 37:55.149
And this woman,
did she introduce them to the traffickers?

37:55.232 --> 37:58.986
Yeah, and according to them,
a boat of illegal immigrants

37:59.069 --> 38:00.529
is gonna land here any day now.

38:00.613 --> 38:06.160
So, they said
that he said that she said...

38:06.368 --> 38:09.079
That's a little light on the PC,
don't you think, fellas?

38:09.246 --> 38:13.000
She was also picked up previously
for manufacturing fake IDs.

38:13.167 --> 38:18.714
Fake IDs.
So was my 16-year-old grandson. Jeez.

38:22.343 --> 38:24.762
Your Honor, we're holding
her on a misdemeanor.

38:24.929 --> 38:29.475
She's gonna make bail on Monday,
and I'm certain she is gonna skip town.

38:29.809 --> 38:35.022
And you'd like to sneak a little peek
inside her domicile before that happens.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.149
Yes, sir, I would.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.444
Well...

38:40.694 --> 38:42.363
I'll think about it.

38:43.823 --> 38:46.659
We're running out of time,
so we brought you her jacket

38:46.826 --> 38:48.452
and everything we have
on Lowry.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.666
Well, like I said,
I'll think about it.

38:55.543 --> 39:00.130
In the meantime, I suggest you
gentlemen vacate my fishing hole.

39:00.714 --> 39:02.883
The croakers are starting to nibble.

39:05.553 --> 39:07.012
Thank you, Your Honor.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.100
Don't run over my line.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.124
Hello.

39:38.502 --> 39:39.670
You Sally?

39:40.129 --> 39:41.255
Yeah.

39:42.882 --> 39:44.633
Yeah, I heard about you.

39:52.308 --> 39:55.936
-My dad actually lived in this place?
-Until he was an adult.

39:58.856 --> 40:00.941
My dad was never an adult.

40:13.412 --> 40:15.456
-Is that my dad?
-Yeah.

40:16.165 --> 40:17.791
And your Uncle John.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.295
Look like a couple of bum chums.

40:32.348 --> 40:33.682
Is this my Aunt Meg?

40:34.892 --> 40:36.769
No, that's Sarah.

40:37.186 --> 40:39.980
Who's that? The dead one?

40:45.527 --> 40:47.863
My dad liked
the dead one the most.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.200
Why did you come here?

40:53.827 --> 40:55.829
John said you wanted to meet me.

40:57.998 --> 41:00.209
I mean,
why did you come down here?

41:00.876 --> 41:02.294
Holy shit.

41:09.802 --> 41:11.428
What is it you want from us?

41:14.181 --> 41:16.517
I don't want anything from you, Sally...

41:18.477 --> 41:20.771
so you can fucking relax.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.692
And you can clean up
your fucking mouth.

41:27.736 --> 41:30.447
Now come inside for some lemonade.

42:07.901 --> 42:11.655
Hey. You Frosty?

42:11.864 --> 42:14.742
-Yeah. Who the fuck are you?
-Mutual friend.

42:19.830 --> 42:21.790
Malaki says he met you at a party.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.376
He didn't tell me
much else, though.

42:24.460 --> 42:26.962
Uh... Well, there's not much else to tell.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.716
So, how long you been
in business?

42:30.924 --> 42:33.886
Uh, I'm not.
I'm just helping out a friend.

42:35.095 --> 42:36.221
Anyone we might know?

42:37.347 --> 42:39.016
You ask a lot of questions.

42:40.809 --> 42:42.603
Just trying to be thorough.

42:44.772 --> 42:47.649
-Can I get you guys something?
-No, thank you, sweetheart.

42:47.816 --> 42:49.651
-How's the pie?
-It's great.

42:49.818 --> 42:51.904
Actually, can I get
a whole one to go,

42:52.071 --> 42:53.989
and a check?

42:54.156 --> 42:55.741
You got it.

43:00.996 --> 43:02.790
Enough small talk?

43:06.293 --> 43:07.836
Okay.

43:08.295 --> 43:10.589
You see that guy out there
smoking a cigarette?

43:12.591 --> 43:15.719
The way this works is, you bring
your stuff to him, he'll sample it.

43:15.886 --> 43:19.807
If everything checks out, he'll text me,
I'll meet you by your car and pay you.

43:26.271 --> 43:28.482
Yeah, I don't-- I don't think so.

43:30.734 --> 43:34.196
-What do you mean?
-That's not gonna really work for me.

43:34.363 --> 43:37.407
-And why is that?
-I'd just rather stay here.

43:38.617 --> 43:41.537
There's a sample in the sugar
if you wanna try it.

43:42.913 --> 43:45.874
If you're satisfied, you get the money,
you bring it to me,

43:46.041 --> 43:48.460
and I'll tell you
where to find the rest of it.

43:50.587 --> 43:52.589
That's not how we do business.

43:52.756 --> 43:56.718
I totally understand that, so if you
wanna walk away right now, that's fine.

44:06.228 --> 44:07.729
Okay.

44:07.896 --> 44:10.983
Okay. We'll do it your way.

45:20.302 --> 45:25.182
How did the witness tampering
go down and whose idea was it?

45:27.017 --> 45:29.394
Carlos, I need you
to tell me this now.

45:31.188 --> 45:35.484
-I don't wanna get anyone in trouble.
-Who might you be getting into trouble?

45:40.238 --> 45:41.239
Miss Rayburn.

45:42.324 --> 45:43.450
What?

45:43.742 --> 45:47.829
-It was her idea. She bribed the witness.
-No. You mean it was Danny's idea.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.957
No, it was your sister, Meg.

45:50.123 --> 45:52.292
She didn't think she'd get
my charges dropped,

45:52.459 --> 45:54.711
so she got Rafi Quintana
to pay the witness.

45:55.379 --> 45:57.005
Fuck you.
My sister barely knew you.

45:57.172 --> 45:59.466
Why would she care
about your charges?

45:59.675 --> 46:03.679
Because she wanted me to help you.
Help the whole Rayburn family.

46:05.764 --> 46:08.100
Help the Rayburn family do what?

46:09.142 --> 46:11.269
Move cocaine through the inn.

46:12.896 --> 46:16.525
You listen to me, Carlos.
You and I had an agreement.

46:16.692 --> 46:19.069
I would keep you
from getting dragged into this

46:19.236 --> 46:21.113
and then one day,
you would help me.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.865
And today is that fucking day.
I need your help.

46:24.074 --> 46:26.076
You only protected me because
you were working for Lowry.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.870
Wayne Lowry is using you
to fuck with me and my family.

46:29.037 --> 46:30.664
After he gets what he wants,

46:30.747 --> 46:33.542
-he's gonna kill you.
-Your family was in on it.

46:47.681 --> 46:50.058
- Thank you.
- No rush.

47:26.928 --> 47:28.597
Fuck, yes.

47:28.764 --> 47:30.307
Fuck.

47:34.770 --> 47:36.229
Mm.

47:44.613 --> 47:45.989
Fuck!

48:01.088 --> 48:02.422
Later.

48:05.258 --> 48:06.635
<i>I spoke with Carlos.</i>

48:06.968 --> 48:09.846
-He said it was all your idea.
-He's lying.

48:10.055 --> 48:14.017
He threatened to put the money on us,
to put the drugs on us. He does that...

48:14.184 --> 48:16.144
that gives motive for Danny
right there.

48:21.149 --> 48:22.859
Who is it?

48:26.154 --> 48:28.782
-Hey, Marco.
-We're good to go on Elena Cortez.

48:29.241 --> 48:31.159
We can search her house.

48:31.368 --> 48:33.036
Judge Hemel signed off.

48:33.370 --> 48:36.039
That's great. Okay. Good job.

48:40.669 --> 48:43.296
-He gave us the warrant.
-You can't.

48:43.797 --> 48:46.091
No way.
You cannot pursue it, John.

48:46.258 --> 48:48.510
-I don't have a choice.
-Lowry's gonna expose us.

48:48.677 --> 48:51.596
It doesn't matter if I do or don't,
Marco is gonna pursue it.

48:51.847 --> 48:54.933
-Well, then tell him to back off.
-I can't-- I can't do that.

48:55.100 --> 48:56.726
I can't do that.

48:58.353 --> 49:01.648
What if you find something that
connects her to Lowry...

49:01.731 --> 49:03.650
what are you gonna do?

49:09.865 --> 49:11.491
Monroe County Sheriff's Department!

49:13.618 --> 49:15.996
Monroe County Sheriff's Department!

49:16.163 --> 49:17.414
Go for it. Go, go, go.

49:19.916 --> 49:21.877
Sheriff's Department!

49:22.544 --> 49:26.131
-Check outside. Check outside.
-The mud and the mosquitoes?

49:26.298 --> 49:29.009
Mud and mosquitoes are good for you.
I'll check in here.

49:29.176 --> 49:30.760
Hey, Reggie.

49:31.386 --> 49:33.263
-Is that her room?
-Yes, sir. This is it.

49:33.430 --> 49:34.848
Come here a second.

49:35.724 --> 49:38.310
Go outside and make sure
he doesn't fuck anything up.

49:38.476 --> 49:41.855
Do me a favor, will you? No one
touches anything until I see it first.

49:42.022 --> 49:43.398
Got it.

50:23.271 --> 50:25.106
Over here.

50:28.568 --> 50:30.278
Come here, pop that.

51:11.027 --> 51:12.904
Everything's clean.

51:27.460 --> 51:30.130
-Any luck?
-No, nothing.

51:30.297 --> 51:31.756
John?

51:31.923 --> 51:33.341
John, anything?

51:37.053 --> 51:38.638
John?

51:41.474 --> 51:42.851
No.

51:43.977 --> 51:45.186
It's clean.

51:55.113 --> 51:57.365
<i>In 1979, I was ten years old.</i>

51:57.532 --> 51:59.868
<i>All of us kids,</i>
<i>we lived here at the inn.</i>

52:00.035 --> 52:03.371
And our parents had one rule,
it was the granddaddy rule of them all.

52:03.538 --> 52:04.956
And that was...

52:05.373 --> 52:09.711
that you do not
go into the guests' rooms, ever.

52:10.462 --> 52:12.213
Well, I was a 10-year-old kid.

52:13.173 --> 52:18.178
One afternoon, a couple guests came
along and they were very mysterious.

52:19.054 --> 52:23.391
And I was intrigued. So, the next
morning, I went to the front desk.

52:24.351 --> 52:25.977
I took their room key,

52:26.561 --> 52:29.481
and I went out and I watched
until they left for the day.

52:30.732 --> 52:34.861
I let myself into their room and my heart
was pounding. I closed that door,

52:35.528 --> 52:37.238
and I tell you, it was like, uh...

52:38.365 --> 52:41.409
It was like being in one of those
detective novels, you know?

52:42.702 --> 52:45.288
And I poked around and I prodded
and I looked here and there.

52:45.955 --> 52:49.501
I laid down on the bed and a couple
hours later, the people came back

52:49.667 --> 52:52.379
and they found a 10-year-old
detective asleep on their bed.

52:53.671 --> 52:54.881
Now, you all knew my father.

52:55.131 --> 52:59.177
Most of you knew my father. God bless him.
You know when he was angry,

52:59.344 --> 53:00.678
he had a silence to him.

53:00.887 --> 53:03.181
And the more silent he was,
the more angry he was.

53:03.348 --> 53:05.725
And I tell you,
he was deadly silent

53:05.892 --> 53:09.521
when we came together,
and he said to me after this, he said:

53:10.397 --> 53:11.856
"I'm happy for you."

53:12.649 --> 53:16.694
<i>Well, he says, "I'm happy for you</i>
<i>because every day after today,</i>

53:16.861 --> 53:21.282
<i>you will always know</i>
<i>the meaning of right and wrong."</i>

53:24.327 --> 53:28.123
And then there was my mother,
who I can never,

53:28.498 --> 53:31.709
never forget the look on your face.

53:31.876 --> 53:33.294
Because it was a look...

53:33.962 --> 53:37.257
of disappointment and betrayal.

53:39.050 --> 53:41.594
And she only said one word to me:

53:44.889 --> 53:46.141
"Why?"

53:51.271 --> 53:55.108
And I'll tell you, I have been trying to
figure out the answer to that question

53:55.275 --> 53:56.734
my whole life.

53:59.487 --> 54:01.656
<i>I don't live here at this inn anymore.</i>

54:04.701 --> 54:06.744
<i>I live in the real world...</i>

54:11.332 --> 54:13.918
<i>where right and wrong...</i>

54:14.836 --> 54:17.213
<i>have life and death consequences.</i>

54:21.468 --> 54:23.511
That's why
I'm officially announcing today

54:23.678 --> 54:26.514
that I am running for
Sheriff of Monroe County.

54:27.849 --> 54:32.520
<i>Because I realized that there is</i>
<i>no answer to my mother's question:</i>

54:33.855 --> 54:35.190
<i>"Why?"</i>

54:39.819 --> 54:41.905
<i>There's only human nature.</i>

54:54.417 --> 54:57.921
<i>And human nature</i>
