WEBVTT

00:09.310 --> 00:10.544
( man shouting )

00:12.246 --> 00:13.447
Hey, Harry...

00:14.148 --> 00:16.350
Stop! Stop!

00:19.187 --> 00:20.554
Hey, what's up?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.090
Throw me a flashlight.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.199
( gasps )

00:33.734 --> 00:37.405
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

00:37.438 --> 00:41.509
and CBS

01:14.708 --> 01:16.544
Agent Gibbs?
Yeah.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.312
Lieutenant Commander
Willis, Base Security.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.181
Commander Hutchins'
day to play golf?

01:20.214 --> 01:22.216
Intestinal virus.

01:22.250 --> 01:26.254
Ah. Special Agent Todd,
McGee and DiNozzo.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.389
How long since anyone's
lived in these units?

01:28.422 --> 01:30.258
Base closed the tract
five years ago.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.892
Plans were to convert it
to a park.

01:31.925 --> 01:32.926
Cutbacks put it on hold.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.429
Units were becoming
a security and health hazard,

01:35.463 --> 01:37.198
We brought in a private
company to demo it.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.399
When Gibbs introduced us,

01:38.432 --> 01:40.368
he introduced you,
then McGee, then me.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.535
Why'd he mention me last?

01:41.569 --> 01:43.171
You a kidding.
No.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.273
For Gibbs to mix up
the seniority order like that,

01:45.306 --> 01:46.707
it's just... just seems weird,
that's all.

01:46.740 --> 01:47.675
Well, I don't think

01:47.708 --> 01:49.243
it really means...
Toby, no.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.244
I wouldn't put too
much stock in it.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.346
Why do you say that?
'Cause I don't
think it has

01:52.380 --> 01:53.614
anything to do
with seniority.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.482
What do you think
it has to do with?

01:54.515 --> 01:55.816
My guess would be level
of intelligence

01:55.849 --> 01:56.850
and general competence.

01:56.884 --> 01:57.885
No.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.754
I didn't
say anything.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.890
It's what you're
thinking, probie.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.458
WILLIS:
Soon as we knew what he had,

02:04.492 --> 02:05.626
all work was stopped.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.261
We contained the scene.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.929
Old bunker?

02:08.962 --> 02:11.299
We don't know what it is.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.306
GIBBS:
A little bit more left.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.313
Your other left, McGee.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.647
Sorry, boss.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.483
TONY:
A little nervous, probie?

02:33.321 --> 02:34.288
GIBBS:
Whoa!

02:34.322 --> 02:35.689
Hold it right there.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.227
GIBBS:
The tunnel leads to the house.

03:05.453 --> 03:08.289
That's a little weird.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.327
( sniffing )

03:22.370 --> 03:23.904
Boss, over here!

03:31.379 --> 03:32.280
Kate, McGee,

03:32.313 --> 03:33.281
you're with me.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.815
DiNozzo,
wait for Ducky.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.499
( wood creaking )

04:05.513 --> 04:06.246
Let's do it.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.252
( camera shutter clicking )

04:27.535 --> 04:30.538
Nails were hammered in
at a left-to-right angle.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.407
Might have been left-handed.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.909
Ever seen anything

04:35.943 --> 04:38.479
like this before, boss?

04:39.813 --> 04:42.416
Only in the movies.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.984
Where's our bride, DiNozzo?

04:46.420 --> 04:48.622
Nine feet down,
twelve feet over.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.924
You're kidding, right?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.528
( whimpers )

04:54.562 --> 04:56.330
This actually reminds me
of my days

04:56.364 --> 04:57.698
at Edinburgh Medical College.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.733
TONY:
You took a tunnel
to get to school, Ducky?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.569
No, the morgue was tiny.

05:01.602 --> 05:05.373
Yeah, we had a... a fellow
student who suffered terribly

05:05.406 --> 05:06.674
from claustrophobia.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.542
DUCKY:
Constantly hyperventilating.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.445
Yes, one day, he decided
to overcome his fear.

05:11.479 --> 05:16.484
Eh... he shut himself
in one of the morgue drawers.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.520
Well, the ventilation
was off, of course.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.922
He asked us not
to disturb him
for 24 hours.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.758
We were very impressed
with his gumption.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.893
Did it work?

05:25.926 --> 05:27.695
Unfortunately not, no.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.398
He died of a massive coronary.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.634
So, you see, people can
be frightened to death.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.769
( hyperventilating )

05:35.803 --> 05:37.571
( camera shutter clicks )

05:37.605 --> 05:38.806
( debris falling )

05:40.708 --> 05:42.576
Hey, Duck.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.714
This is really sick.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.082
Stephen King would love it.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.518
Oh, my dear.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.454
Get you out
of this place.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.392
( sniffing )

05:58.426 --> 06:01.795
Into somewhere
more appropriate...

06:01.829 --> 06:03.531
I promise.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.933
That was really nice, Doctor.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.435
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.037
Now, if you'd give me
the bag for transportation.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.776
It's in the... truck.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.778
DUCKY:
I know.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.880
Next time, you'll remember.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.615
Oh.

06:21.649 --> 06:22.616
Uh...

06:26.520 --> 06:28.622
The Good Wife's Guide.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.624
Ten Steps To Pleasing
Your Husband.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.960
I think I read something
like that in Redbook.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.528
Redbook?

06:34.562 --> 06:36.597
Yeah.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.533
You read Redbook?

06:40.934 --> 06:43.170
Yeah, all the time.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.738
Well, I don't think
you read this one, McGee.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.074
It's from May, 1955.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.877
How long's she been here, Duck?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.712
Oh, it's hard
to say, Jethro.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.881
Poor thing's been dead
for months.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.682
How about years?

06:54.715 --> 06:57.417
Perhaps one...
not more than two.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.757
Housing's been abandoned
for five years.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.059
Well, then she wasn't
the last tenant.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.928
Check it anyway.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.697
( man shouting,
debris falling )

07:15.569 --> 07:17.204
The last tenant in that house

07:17.237 --> 07:19.139
was Lieutenant Commander
Carlton Halpin,

07:19.172 --> 07:20.708
his wife and two children.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.175
Moved out January, '99.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.177
Transferred to the San Diego
Naval Station.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.179
As far as we can tell,
he's never been back.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.380
McGee?

07:27.414 --> 07:29.683
All the materials used in
the construction of the bunker

07:29.717 --> 07:31.552
could've been purchased
at any Lowe's in the area.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.686
DiNozzo?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.888
A lot of the furniture in
the room is authentic '50s

07:34.922 --> 07:37.024
Not my taste, but what the hell.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.562
All from various manufacturers.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.730
Nothing in production today.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.665
The way I figure it,
he would have

07:44.698 --> 07:45.966
to have collected the pieces

07:45.999 --> 07:47.835
from antique shops
or garage sales.

07:47.868 --> 07:48.669
What about the possibility

07:48.702 --> 07:50.103
they were handed down
from family?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.004
Yeah, I was getting to that.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.840
There is, of course,
always the possibility

07:52.873 --> 07:54.241
that the pieces had
been handed down

07:54.274 --> 07:55.609
from family members.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.077
Point is...

07:57.110 --> 07:59.880
either scenario is not a road
that's easily traceable.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.585
Question for you, probie.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.521
Redbook. Why?

08:07.555 --> 08:08.522
Redbook was and still is

08:08.556 --> 08:11.124
the definitive magazine
for today's young woman.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.827
Planning a sex change?

08:13.861 --> 08:16.129
No. Since I've always
been interested in women,

08:16.163 --> 08:18.599
I figured the best way
to know about them was to,

08:18.632 --> 08:20.934
you know, know about them.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.871
McGee...

08:23.904 --> 08:28.008
the best way to know about
them... is to know them.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.981
JIMMY:
Do you think
she knew him?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.983
Well, it's difficult to say.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.652
She could have been lured
by a confidant

08:38.686 --> 08:40.688
or grabbed by a...
by a stranger.

08:40.721 --> 08:44.091
The result, unfortunately,
in the case of so many women,

08:44.124 --> 08:46.326
is the same either way.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.828
Is your recorder on?

08:47.861 --> 08:48.929
Do you want
it to be on?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.964
No, do you want it on?

08:50.998 --> 08:52.800
It helps me to be more
accurate in my report.

08:52.833 --> 08:53.867
Well, then turn it on.

08:53.901 --> 08:54.868
It is on.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.269
Then why didn't you
just say so?

08:56.303 --> 08:57.605
I'm... n-not sure.

08:57.638 --> 09:01.108
The victim is a
Caucasian woman, 20 to 25.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.877
Cause of death
can be attributed

09:03.911 --> 09:05.946
to non-specific
asphyxiation.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.849
No obvious signs
of sexual trauma.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.852
But due to the dehydration
and mummification of tissue,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.855
it's impossible to say
whether she was violated.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.190
Yeah, but you'd think
that she was though, right?

09:19.026 --> 09:20.794
I mean all-all the stories
that you read about,

09:20.828 --> 09:22.796
these guys, they usually
don't keep girls down in a...

09:22.830 --> 09:24.965
cellar for conversation.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.068
Where do you read
these stories, Mr. Palmer?

09:28.101 --> 09:31.338
I... I-I-I didn't mean
that I actually read them.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.106
I-I meant to say that-that...

09:33.140 --> 09:34.942
She wore a ring.

09:34.975 --> 09:35.976
A wedding ring?

09:36.009 --> 09:37.044
Yeah, no doubt.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.080
It was removed violently.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.950
Mr. Palmer...

09:43.984 --> 09:46.854
What stories?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.665
What do you have, Abby?

09:57.698 --> 09:59.633
What don't I have, Gibbs?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.034
Clothing fibers, carpet fibers,

10:01.068 --> 10:03.937
dust, beetle parts,
soiled bedding...

10:03.971 --> 10:07.307
There's even a pamphlet
called The Good Wife's Guide.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.742
What's up with that?

10:08.776 --> 10:09.843
Ask McGee.

10:09.877 --> 10:10.978
McGee?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.279
McGee.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.881
( chuckling ):
Really.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.148
The dress, Abby?

10:15.182 --> 10:16.116
As you might imagine,

10:16.149 --> 10:18.185
it's not exactly virginal.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.853
It was made in 1952.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.955
She'd wearing it for
months before she died.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.957
And I'm running a DNA sample
as we....

10:25.759 --> 10:26.727
Prints?

10:26.760 --> 10:27.995
All over the room.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.830
Thanks to our semi-mummy,

10:29.863 --> 10:31.264
I was able to get a match
for our victim.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.933
Your crack team is
running it through AFIS.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.735
Only prints
in the room were hers?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.036
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.906
I found traces of cleanser
on the furniture.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.808
He's cautious.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.176
So am I, when I...
chain guys up.

10:46.714 --> 10:47.915
( chuckles )

10:47.948 --> 10:49.049
Victim is Carolyn Figgis.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.318
Petty Officer Third Class. 22.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.720
Went missing 18 months ago.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.021
I pulled the file, Boss.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.022
It was a Pacci case.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.023
Didn't have much.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.390
She left for work one morning

10:57.424 --> 10:59.059
and poof, gone!

10:59.092 --> 11:00.928
No witnesses, case went cold.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.429
Yeah, well, it just
got hot again.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.965
Ducky estimates she's
been dead about a year.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.835
That means she was in the bunker
for six months before she died.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.469
That rules out the last tenants.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.138
Kate?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.205
Tell me about
the killer.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.074
The basic pathology is obvious.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.843
He was probably
abused as a child.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.946
Dad beating on mom; one or both
beating on him, who knows?

11:18.979 --> 11:21.248
He's trying to create
the perfect relationship.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.115
That's right.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.984
And control's
the name of the game.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.019
This one didn't live up
to his expectations.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.688
Why was I sure you'd
understand that part?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.124
So, cut off her air supply,

11:31.158 --> 11:33.961
left her in an airtight chamber
to die and moved on.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.029
KATE:
Yeah, that's
the problem.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.198
This kind of pathology
is driven.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.401
He's not going to stop
until he finds the perfect one.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.837
He's playing house with
somebody else out there.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.852
Something's off.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.721
Gibbs, I recreated it
from McGee's photos.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.192
Gibbs, everything
in here was ALS'd.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.228
All pertinent forensic evidence
was sent to Abby for analysis,

12:08.261 --> 12:09.997
and then I rebuilt it
from the photos.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.336
This room and everything in it

12:16.369 --> 12:18.972
is exactly as it was
when we found it.

12:21.975 --> 12:22.976
( sighing )

12:44.031 --> 12:46.133
What is with
his '50s thing?

12:46.166 --> 12:48.836
The '50s represents
an idealized time

12:48.869 --> 12:52.072
when the rules between men
and women were simpler.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.907
This was an older guy.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.042
Actually, I think
he was younger.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.310
As Tony said,

12:57.344 --> 13:00.013
a lot of the stuff in here
is authentic '50s,

13:00.047 --> 13:01.181
but a lot of it isn't.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.183
Some is '60s,
some are reproductions,

13:03.216 --> 13:05.552
but it isn't pure.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.888
He couldn't get his hands
on the real deal.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.156
I don't think it mattered.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.490
I think he put
this room together

13:10.523 --> 13:12.059
based on his idea of a fantasy,

13:12.092 --> 13:15.929
rather than some remembrance
of an ideal experience.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.565
Someone who grew up with it
would be more "pure"?

13:18.598 --> 13:20.433
Well, I think he'd want
to be as close

13:20.467 --> 13:22.602
to what he actually
experienced as possible.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.636
Plus, he didn't seem
to have a problem

13:23.670 --> 13:25.605
with just picking up
and leaving everything behind.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.376
How do we know
he didn't have to leave?

13:29.409 --> 13:32.112
Transferred.
It's possible.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.614
Ducky said her wedding ring
was removed.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.549
Well, it makes sense--
that'd be the one thing

13:36.583 --> 13:39.052
that he keeps in common
from one "bride" to the next.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.355
You know, it might help

13:42.389 --> 13:43.991
if I could observe
a reenactment

13:44.024 --> 13:46.059
of the victim's life
inside the chamber.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.161
Put someone in the wedding
dress.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.030
Tony would look cute.
No.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.332
He's interviewing
the victim's parents.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.967
Well, McGee, then.
Nope.

13:54.001 --> 13:54.968
He's with Tony.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.304
Abby?
No.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.039
Up to her tats
in forensics tests.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.173
Well, what about you?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.049
You won't have
to wear the dress.

14:10.250 --> 14:14.321
( rock song blaring on radio )

14:18.325 --> 14:19.159
( turns radio off )

14:19.192 --> 14:20.994
I hate that song, McGee.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.163
I thought you bought tickets
to see them next week.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.164
Changed my mind.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.098
I'm selling them on eBay.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.499
Oh.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.502
Well, could we listen
to something else?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.138
Sure.

14:31.171 --> 14:38.946
( country-western music playing
)

14:38.979 --> 14:40.914
This isn't about music, is it?

14:40.948 --> 14:42.049
This what?

14:42.082 --> 14:45.085
Whatever it is,
it isn't music?

14:45.118 --> 14:47.120
This is your conversation,
McGee.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.925
Tony, I'm not after your job.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.126
( sardonic laugh )

14:53.160 --> 14:54.327
Do you think I'm
actually worried

14:54.361 --> 14:56.029
about you taking
my place, probie?

14:56.063 --> 14:56.496
No... I mean,

14:56.529 --> 14:58.031
of course not.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.132
How could I be?

14:59.166 --> 15:01.068
You're Gibbs' right-hand guy.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.102
Did Gibbs say that?

15:02.135 --> 15:05.638
Uh... not...
not directly.

15:05.672 --> 15:06.873
Then why did you say that?

15:06.906 --> 15:11.945
Well... well... 'cause I've,
I've heard him say nice things.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.313
What kind of things?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.949
I-I-I don't remember.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.450
Remember.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.289
Um... okay.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.957
Uh, yesterday.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.092
Yeah?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.627
Yeah. He, uh...
said... something

15:27.660 --> 15:29.462
about filing
your case report.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.164
What did he say, exactly?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.935
He said it wasn't late,
for once.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.540
( engine revving )

15:40.573 --> 15:43.276
This is not what I
had in mind, Gibbs.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.978
You wanted a reenactment.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.047
Reenact.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.116
I wanted to observe.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.118
I'm observing.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.153
( sighing )

15:54.287 --> 15:55.622
Okay.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.292
She can make it to the toilet.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.201
But she couldn't make it
to the threshold of the tunnel.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.569
( straining )

16:13.606 --> 16:16.609
KATE:
I can't imagine what she must
have gone through, Gibbs.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.146
How many months did she suffer
before giving up

16:19.179 --> 16:21.414
and realizing she was
never gonna be found?

16:21.448 --> 16:24.651
That no one was going to hear
her scream.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.086
She had nothing left to do

16:26.119 --> 16:29.056
but sit and stare
at her own reflection.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.401
GIBBS:
Hmm...

16:41.434 --> 16:42.402
What?

16:42.435 --> 16:44.071
The rug.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.607
The spots.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.278
Someone was standing there
over and over again.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.479
Mm-mm. The pattern's wrong.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.814
It's not from a shoe or foot.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.217
It's too round, too large.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.120
She wasn't standing.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.388
She was kneeling.

17:05.558 --> 17:08.728
Enough to permanently wear
an indentation in the carpet.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.432
Praying.
Praying.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.502
Polopinus Ingens,

17:15.535 --> 17:18.305
commonly known as
the darkling beetle.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.639
As with all beetles,

17:19.672 --> 17:21.608
the darkling has
two sets of wings.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.243
One set of hard front wings

17:23.276 --> 17:25.678
and a set of soft hind wings,
used for flying.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.714
This is going to be
useful, Abby, why?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.783
Gibbs, I know you know
that I need a good windup

17:30.817 --> 17:32.252
before I deliver my knockout.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.686
Just hit me with it, baby.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.521
Okay.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.757
This particular species
of darkling

17:37.790 --> 17:39.826
is indigenous only in extreme

17:39.859 --> 17:42.262
Southeast Georgia
and Northeast Florida.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.197
What's it doing
in Virginia?
My guess?

17:44.231 --> 17:45.598
Somebody stepped on it.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.699
A piece of it got lodged

17:46.733 --> 17:47.767
in her shoe

17:47.800 --> 17:50.603
and then it dislodged
in Mr. Sicko's love nest.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.840
Very Silence Of The Lambs,
don't you think?

17:56.243 --> 17:58.811
Our nasty little critter
could've called any one of three

17:58.845 --> 18:00.580
Navy bases home:

18:00.613 --> 18:01.814
Jacksonville Naval Air Station

18:01.848 --> 18:04.584
or Mayport Naval Station
in Florida;

18:04.617 --> 18:06.353
Naval Submarine Base,
Kings Bay, Georgia.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.222
We have a piece of a beetle
that shouldn't be in Virginia.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.558
It doesn't mean that the guy
who did this is there now.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.392
Didn't say it did.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.294
No, she's right, boss.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.763
I mean, he could've just been
there on vacation, who knows?

18:16.796 --> 18:17.764
Could've been.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.832
TONY:
He still could be here.

18:19.866 --> 18:20.633
Except nobody else
is missing from Norfolk.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.869
Somebody is from Jacksonville.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.704
She fits the profile.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.473
NCIS Agent
Jane Melankovic

18:26.506 --> 18:28.141
forwarded a Missing
Persons Report

18:28.175 --> 18:30.810
she filed on a female
petty officer.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.780
Barbara Swain, Petty Officer

18:33.813 --> 18:35.382
Second Class at Jacksonville.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.784
She's been missing
for almost four months.

18:37.817 --> 18:41.788
She's close in age to
Carolyn Figgis; similar look.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.923
McGEE:
Same deal, too-- disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.259
Never made it to work.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.495
No witnesses, no clues,
case went dead.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.698
Get us on the next
flight to Jacksonville

18:51.731 --> 18:52.732
and tell Agent Melankovic

18:52.765 --> 18:55.535
we think her victim might
still be alive on base.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.736
On it, boss.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.405
Pretty thin, Gibbs.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.906
All we've got, Kate.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.813
The Seahawk's still searching
for thermal anomalies

19:06.846 --> 19:08.481
on the ground surface.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.683
Been sweeping for a long time,
Agent Melankovic.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.486
At this altitude, they're
working 150-foot swatches.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.722
It's time-consuming
but more accurate.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.258
Hungry again, Tony?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.259
Actually, no, Kate.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.494
I... I'm just bored.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.330
I had something
to eat on the plane.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.732
Not sure what I ate,
but it was filling.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.800
( deep inhale )

19:27.834 --> 19:31.338
You had the chicken Singapore
with port mushroom sauce.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.905
Something you read
in Redbook McGee?

19:32.939 --> 19:34.441
Ladies' Home Journal, actually.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.210
The Food and Home section?

19:37.244 --> 19:38.211
Yeah, that's right.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.346
The best.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.780
Oh, no question.

19:41.614 --> 19:42.882
McGee, right?

19:42.915 --> 19:44.217
Timothy.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.552
Jane.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.986
Me Tony.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.721
( sighing )

19:48.755 --> 19:49.856
Oh, looks like
they're picking up

19:49.889 --> 19:51.558
a thermal signature; it's warm.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.926
Warm is good.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.201
Let's go!

20:29.996 --> 20:30.897
Whoa, whoa, don't shoot!

20:30.930 --> 20:31.898
Don't shoot!

20:31.931 --> 20:33.800
Please don't shoot!

20:39.005 --> 20:41.341
Petty Officer Third Class
Darrell Baum.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.842
Works in Avionics.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.677
Claims he was growing
for his own personal use.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.878
What do you think?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.381
Well, there's over
200 plants, boss.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.949
Gotta think
he's spreading the love.

20:49.982 --> 20:53.486
I am pretty sure Darrell's
cutting into his profit margin.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.654
There's nothing here.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.488
Doesn't look like it.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.690
Says he started
over three months ago.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.592
Size of the weeds indicates
that would be about right.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.294
And you'd know this
because...?

21:01.328 --> 21:03.463
Of my experiences with the
Baltimore PD Drug Task Force.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.732
You were never
on the Baltimore
PD Drug Task Force.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.801
I have friends;
we shared experiences.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.937
Actually, Darrell does seem
to be on the level, boss.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.739
Oh, and you know
this, why, McGee?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.341
From personal knowledge?

21:14.374 --> 21:15.742
No. No, no, no.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.976
I-I mean, you know, there was

21:17.009 --> 21:18.445
the occasional, uh,

21:18.478 --> 21:19.379
innocent youth,

21:19.412 --> 21:19.979
experimenta...

21:20.012 --> 21:21.013
Commander Spencer

21:21.047 --> 21:22.682
would like to see you, sir.

21:24.951 --> 21:25.752
TONY:
Let me guess.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.686
You never inhaled.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.488
I inhaled.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.589
Yeah?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.791
Yeah. Once. A little bit.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.026
How was it?

21:34.060 --> 21:35.628
I didn't like it.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.397
You didn't like it?

21:37.430 --> 21:39.065
No.

21:39.098 --> 21:42.001
He didn't inhale.
He didn't inhale.

21:42.034 --> 21:45.672
All 423 houses have been
analyzed, Agent Gibbs.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.708
No heat signatures other than
this one have been recorded.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.810
Okay with you if
I recall the helo?

21:50.843 --> 21:52.679
( helicopter whirring )

21:57.484 --> 21:59.386
What now, Gibbs?

22:01.020 --> 22:01.821
Well,

22:22.842 --> 22:23.910
ABBY:
Shot the forensics wad
on our mummified bride.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.879
Except for the prints,

22:26.913 --> 22:27.880
nothing in
the underground chamber

22:27.914 --> 22:28.881
is really speaking to me.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.783
The carpet fiber indicates

22:30.817 --> 22:33.420
a cheap nylon product,
available anywhere.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.054
The analysis
of the accumulated dust

22:35.087 --> 22:37.657
only indicates
that our sicko murderer

22:37.690 --> 22:39.592
wasn't any better a housekeeper

22:39.626 --> 22:41.027
than he was a pretend husband.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.829
Clothes fibers.
White cotton,

22:42.862 --> 22:45.398
probably socks and purple silk.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.566
Don't know what that's about.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.769
Maybe a scarf or an ascot
kind of thing.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.471
KATE:
How many guys
wear ascots today?

22:51.504 --> 22:52.872
I have.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.106
You would.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.975
GIBBS:
Okay. Thanks, Abbs.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.844
Oh, anything for you,
oh, Wonderful Wizard.

22:57.877 --> 22:58.811
By the way, Tony...

22:58.845 --> 23:00.580
Yeah?

23:00.613 --> 23:02.815
I need it back when you're done.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.452
MELANKOVIC:
Files you requested.

23:05.485 --> 23:06.753
All transfers
from Norfolk

23:06.786 --> 23:07.887
over the past
six months.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.789
Put them over there,
Agent Melankovic.

23:11.458 --> 23:12.892
Hey, we appreciate
the use of your desk.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.193
Not a problem.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.796
You finding everything
all right?

23:16.829 --> 23:18.598
GIBBS:
Yeah, DiNozzo there

23:18.631 --> 23:20.600
sure found the nuts
without much trouble.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.738
I haven't eaten
since the plane.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.139
I hope you don't mind.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.508
I do, actually.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.842
They're for my sister.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.179
Oh, sorry.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.615
But... probably for the best.

23:35.648 --> 23:36.849
So fattening.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.685
I'm sure you know that from

23:38.718 --> 23:39.986
all your food magazine
reading.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.521
She's anorexic.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.590
GIBBS:
According to
the Missing Persons report,

23:43.623 --> 23:46.459
the last person
to see Petty Officer Swain

23:46.493 --> 23:47.827
was her roommate.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.896
That's right.
Petty Officer Debra Marshall.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.498
She still on base?

23:51.531 --> 23:52.832
Mechanic in Motor-T.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.166
All right, Kate, you're with me.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.167
DiNozzo, you're

23:55.201 --> 23:56.703
with McGee.
McGee. Yep.

23:56.736 --> 23:57.870
Help her with
the transfers.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.539
Agent Gibbs...

24:00.673 --> 24:01.941
I did the initial interview

24:01.974 --> 24:03.009
with the roommate.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.744
Yeah.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.614
I know.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.988
Petty Officer Marshall?

24:16.022 --> 24:17.023
Yeah.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.090
NCIS.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.963
Is it about Barbara, ma'am?

24:23.996 --> 24:25.498
KATE:
Yes.

24:25.532 --> 24:26.198
Have you found her?

24:26.232 --> 24:27.233
No.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.270
You don't expect her
to be found alive?

24:31.303 --> 24:33.239
I was told the odds get worse

24:33.272 --> 24:35.642
the longer a person
goes missing, sir.

24:35.675 --> 24:38.711
Well, yeah. That's true.

24:38.745 --> 24:40.680
KATE:
Agent Melankovic
might have

24:40.713 --> 24:42.114
gone over this ground
with you before, but...

24:42.148 --> 24:44.584
No problem, ma'am.

24:44.617 --> 24:45.785
You last saw your roommate

24:45.818 --> 24:47.620
when she left for work
four months ago.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.955
It was 0600, sir.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.190
She worked here in Admin.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.025
That's how we met.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.027
Was there anyone acting
strange around her,

24:55.061 --> 24:57.864
any arguments or disputes
you might know about?

24:57.897 --> 24:58.931
No, ma'am.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.067
Everybody liked Barbara.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.002
Even likable people
have beefs.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.106
So I'm told.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.307
Was there anything

25:08.340 --> 25:10.543
particular on her mind
at the time?

25:10.577 --> 25:13.980
Nothing other than what
was always on her mind.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.081
Guys.

25:15.114 --> 25:19.118
She was hung up that she
couldn't find the right one.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.620
She wanted
to get married.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.689
In the worst way, sir.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.191
Except all the guys
she met were losers.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.026
She thought

25:27.059 --> 25:28.661
something must be wrong
with her.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.030
Even mentioned she might
even see somebody about it.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.031
Did she?

25:32.064 --> 25:33.299
I don't know.

25:33.332 --> 25:35.668
She was a really
private person.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.705
Did you ever meet
any of the losers?

25:38.738 --> 25:39.872
No, sir.

25:39.906 --> 25:43.309
I couldn't even tell you
their names.

25:43.342 --> 25:46.178
I doubt Barbara could, either.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.247
CPO Alan Drewe.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.349
Transferred from Norfolk
two months ago.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.984
Left-handed.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.252
Father
was a drywall sub-contractor.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.721
He could've
built a bunker.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.122
Captain Marshall Buckner.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.124
Right-handed,
but heads up a Seabee crew,

25:58.157 --> 26:00.993
and has a domestic disturbance
charge on his record.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.829
Transferred last May.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.731
"Always respond
enthusiastically

26:04.764 --> 26:06.899
"to your husband's
amorous advances.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.167
"It's a wife's duty

26:08.200 --> 26:11.738
to make sure his physical needs
are met."

26:11.771 --> 26:13.172
You know,

26:13.205 --> 26:15.274
except for
the murder/abduction part,

26:15.307 --> 26:17.910
I kind of think this guy's
onto something.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.178
I can't believe you said that.

26:19.211 --> 26:20.346
Why?

26:20.379 --> 26:22.181
It's sexist

26:22.214 --> 26:24.917
and insensitive
and what the hell

26:24.951 --> 26:26.619
does it have to do
with our investigation?

26:27.820 --> 26:29.689
Do you know, Timothy?

26:31.791 --> 26:33.860
Answer Jane, Timothy.

26:38.130 --> 26:41.668
The real question is,
do yo find it pertinent?

26:41.701 --> 26:44.771
Every bit as pertinent
to this investigation
as those files, probie.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.005
It is?

26:46.038 --> 26:49.041
Speaks to the suspect's
state of mind.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.045
Tony, with all due respect,

26:53.079 --> 26:55.748
I think it speaks
to the state of your...

26:55.782 --> 26:57.349
With all due respect,
probie!

26:57.383 --> 26:57.884
How much time do you
have in the field?

26:57.917 --> 26:59.786
Not a lot, of course.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.854
Exactly, because
you're a probationary

27:01.888 --> 27:02.655
field agent.

27:02.689 --> 27:06.258
I know it can be
confusing sometimes.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.028
I'm actually not confused.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.697
Oh, you just think
you're not confused.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.864
In reality,

27:11.898 --> 27:13.065
you're very confused.

27:13.099 --> 27:16.869
And that contradiction is
what makes the whole situation

27:16.903 --> 27:18.871
seem, um,

27:18.905 --> 27:20.439
more...

27:20.472 --> 27:22.008
uh...

27:22.041 --> 27:23.743
Confusing.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.712
Exactly.

27:29.849 --> 27:32.018
Just because she didn't
see a Navy therapist

27:32.051 --> 27:34.253
doesn't mean she wasn't
seeing someone off base.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.454
She's a Petty Officer.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.289
Civilian shrinks
are expensive.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.991
Private people go to
long lengths sometimes.

27:39.025 --> 27:41.794
Sometimes.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.029
Sometimes
they don't have to.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.698
Bit's in your
mouth, Gibbs.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.333
She didn't have
to see a shrink.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.434
Okay.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.837
Second divorce.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.138
Saw the padre.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.741
Chaplains don't
keep records.

27:54.774 --> 27:55.875
Yes, I saw her.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.944
Only once, though.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.478
We know that whatever you
discussed is confidential,

27:59.511 --> 28:02.381
but her life could hang
in the balance.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.983
What happened to the woman
in Norfolk

28:04.016 --> 28:05.084
could be happening to her.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.490
Petty Officer Swain
didn't say much.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.325
In fact, I did most
of the talking.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.994
What were her issues?

28:15.027 --> 28:16.796
She was attracted to men

28:16.829 --> 28:19.899
who fulfilled her needs
on a physical level,

28:19.932 --> 28:21.167
but not a spiritual one.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.802
And I tried
to make her see

28:22.835 --> 28:25.805
they didn't need
to be mutually exclusive.

28:25.838 --> 28:28.274
It's a difficult concept
in today's world.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.409
Did she mention any of those men
by name?

28:30.442 --> 28:31.510
No, she met them in bars.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.980
I got the impression
they weren't around very long.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.048
She was supposed to call
and make another appointment.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.083
Never did.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.285
McGEE:
Well, this one's
not left-handed either,

28:39.318 --> 28:40.286
but everything else fits.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.122
( phone rings )

28:49.361 --> 28:50.329
DiNozzo.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.064
GIBBS:
How's it going
with the transfers?

28:52.098 --> 28:53.432
Uh, almost finished, boss.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.400
We've ID'd 15

28:54.433 --> 28:56.435
that fit a substantial
part of the profile.

28:56.468 --> 28:57.837
Good.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.505
Put down
The Good Wife's Guide

28:59.538 --> 29:01.507
and listen up.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.142
Padre thinks says
Petty Officer Swain

29:03.175 --> 29:05.111
could have met this guy
at a local bar.

29:05.144 --> 29:06.312
Split up, canvass the area.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.314
See if a bartender can make
a connection to one of 'em?

29:09.448 --> 29:12.084
I'll make copies
of their service photos.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.185
Uh, DiNozzo?

29:13.219 --> 29:14.253
Yeah?

29:14.286 --> 29:17.156
Make the copies yourself.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.326
Of course.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.045
GIBBS:
You're sure about this, DiNozzo?

29:39.078 --> 29:40.947
All in his SRB, boss:
Left-handed,

29:40.980 --> 29:42.114
transferred
six months ago.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.349
From where?

29:43.382 --> 29:44.583
Norfolk.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.485
Boss, you remember what Abby
said about the clothes fibers?

29:46.518 --> 29:49.055
Chaplains sometimes
wear a vestment

29:49.088 --> 29:50.056
called a stole
over their uniform.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.491
It's a band of silk cloth
hung around the neck.

29:52.524 --> 29:53.692
Silk.

29:53.725 --> 29:57.029
The color of the stole depends
on the liturgical season.

29:57.063 --> 29:58.898
It can be red, or green,
or white...

29:58.931 --> 29:59.932
Or purple.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.102
( tires screeching )

30:05.237 --> 30:07.539
It wasn't Petty Officer
Carolyn Figgis
who was praying, was it?

30:07.573 --> 30:09.175
No.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.280
( tires squealing )

30:36.535 --> 30:37.136
( gunshot )

31:04.063 --> 31:05.064
After your interview,

31:05.097 --> 31:07.499
he must have sensed
it was just a matter of time.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.902
What do you know
about him, Commander?

31:09.936 --> 31:11.003
Not much.

31:11.037 --> 31:14.240
He was Episcopal-- I'm Catholic.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.575
Only time I ever met him
was at the Navy Ball.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.477
Seemed normal to me.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.678
Yeah.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.013
Usually do.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.915
Medical examiner's on the way.

31:22.949 --> 31:26.618
I'll get the
search helo
back in the air.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.120
I wonder what
Ducky would say

31:28.154 --> 31:29.288
to this piece of work.

31:29.321 --> 31:32.191
He'd ask Evans where he's
keeping Petty Office Swain.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.026
I said I'm gonna get married.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.929
John said he's
gonna get married.

31:36.963 --> 31:38.097
( audience laughing )

31:38.130 --> 31:39.098
That's great!

31:39.131 --> 31:40.299
That's wonderful, John.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.433
You're the one

31:41.467 --> 31:42.634
who convinced me, Oz.

31:42.668 --> 31:45.637
Why this delightful home,
wonderful family, devoted wife.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.406
Ah, this is the way
a man should live.

31:47.439 --> 31:50.209
I didn't realize what I'd
been missing all these years.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.678
What are you watching?

31:52.711 --> 31:54.680
Ozzie and Harriet.

31:54.713 --> 31:58.317
Ran for 14 years,
435 episodes.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.552
McGEE:
Why am I not surprised
you would know that?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.354
I have the "best of"
box set at home.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.423
It's really good.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.025
Where'd you find those?

32:06.058 --> 32:08.394
Uh, found them stashed
under the settee.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.395
The settee?

32:09.428 --> 32:10.596
It's a small sofa

32:10.629 --> 32:12.364
with seating for two.

32:12.398 --> 32:16.002
Sold mine at a garage
sale last year.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.037
Are you gonna watch
the whole hour, or...?

32:18.070 --> 32:21.073
They were a half-hour,
McGee, and what if I do?

32:21.107 --> 32:22.641
I guess that would mean

32:22.674 --> 32:26.212
you're trying to figure
the suspect's state of mind?

32:26.245 --> 32:28.147
Ha! We're gonna make
a field agent

32:28.180 --> 32:29.548
out of you yet, Probie.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.385
DiNozzo!

32:33.419 --> 32:36.188
( sighs )

32:38.324 --> 32:41.127
Flipped on the light
switch-- look what I got.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.130
Well, it's either a darkroom,
or a really small bordello.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.197
What's your call?

32:45.231 --> 32:47.599
Have you always been a
smart ass, Agent DiNozzo?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.568
Tony. Probably as long
as you've been

32:49.601 --> 32:53.005
an overachiever, Jane.

32:53.039 --> 32:56.342
He might have pictures
somewhere around here...

32:56.375 --> 32:57.176
to remind him.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.145
He might.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.713
Are you ready to find where
Ozzie stashed Harriet?

33:07.053 --> 33:09.188
( catlike growling )

33:13.659 --> 33:16.762
SPENCER:
The Chaplain could have hidden
her in a number of places

33:16.795 --> 33:18.630
the thermal scanner
wouldn't pick up.

33:18.664 --> 33:21.633
We have unoccupied housing,
training and maintenance units,

33:21.667 --> 33:25.371
as well as boiler rooms
here and here.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.673
Base housing storage is
another possibility.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.109
Several abandoned ammo dumps
in this quadrant,

33:30.142 --> 33:31.543
and an ammo bunker's
in this one here.

33:31.577 --> 33:34.780
Jacksonville N.A.S. is
almost 4,000 acres.

33:34.813 --> 33:35.681
Hundreds of buildings.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.284
It'll take us days
to search them all.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.585
Then we'd better start now.

33:39.618 --> 33:40.652
How much time
does she have?

33:40.686 --> 33:42.821
If he cuts off
the O2 like he
did the others,

33:42.854 --> 33:44.123
a few hours.

33:45.791 --> 33:48.727
"My Darling, my betrothed.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.697
I long for the day
we will be together always..."

33:51.730 --> 33:54.200
Must be more than 50
of these love letters.

33:54.233 --> 33:57.636
All sounding like
Nelson Eddy recordings.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.238
That guy was on the air
for 14 years

33:59.271 --> 34:00.439
singing lyrics like that?

34:00.472 --> 34:02.208
Different Nelson.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.676
Not Ozzie Nelson, Nelson Eddy.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.246
Do you have his collection, too?

34:07.279 --> 34:08.714
The Forgotten Recordings.

34:10.449 --> 34:13.552
You, you seem to have an awful
lot in common with this...

34:34.740 --> 34:36.608
Uh-huh.

34:39.278 --> 34:40.646
Oh, yeah.

34:47.419 --> 34:49.221
Whoa.

34:49.255 --> 34:53.292
She's not Petty
Officer Figgis or Swain.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.766
And neither is this one.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.672
There's Figgis.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.775
MELANKOVIC:
God, she looks terrified.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.844
Here's Swain.

35:17.249 --> 35:20.452
Where did he hide you,
Petty Officer Swain?

35:20.552 --> 35:22.621
I'll scan the prints,
upload them to Abby.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.593
Wish we had
the negatives.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.362
Probie.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.731
Negatives.

35:32.764 --> 35:37.503
When I was a kid I used to hide
stuff in my record player.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.471
Nice work...

35:39.505 --> 35:40.506
hotshot.

35:42.508 --> 35:43.642
( clicks tongue )

35:43.675 --> 35:46.378
Some of these prints were
enlarged from the negatives.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.314
I think you'll find this one
very interesting.

35:48.347 --> 35:52.218
Okay, this is Petty Officer
Swain's photo from the album.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.486
Now look at the full negative.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.189
There's much more visible in the
background now around the bed,

35:57.223 --> 35:59.558
and there's
some sort of door to the left.

35:59.591 --> 36:00.626
Abbs, can you blow that up?

36:00.659 --> 36:01.660
Lighten it?

36:01.693 --> 36:02.861
Oh, yeah.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.635
ABBY:
It's a riveted door frame.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.570
GIBBS:
That's an ammo bunker.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.948
SPENCER:
You're right, Gibbs.
These ammo bunkers

36:22.981 --> 36:25.651
are the only underground
structures on the base
with riveted doors.

36:25.684 --> 36:26.518
How many?

36:26.552 --> 36:28.554
Six bunkers,
all with multiple corridors

36:28.587 --> 36:29.955
and up to a hundred
compartments each.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.823
Some units have bar locks,
others padlocks.

36:31.857 --> 36:32.724
They've been vacated so long,

36:32.758 --> 36:34.593
I couldn't get access
to a master key.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.328
We'll need bolt cutters.
Got 'em.

36:36.362 --> 36:37.396
The search dogs
won't be here

36:37.429 --> 36:38.664
for another half-hour.
We can't wait.

36:38.697 --> 36:42.734
Kate. McGee. DiNozzo.
Take Bunker Two. Thanks.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.836
Melankovic,
you're with me.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.638
We'll take Bunker Three.

36:51.477 --> 36:52.478
Clear.

37:12.831 --> 37:13.799
Clear.

37:13.832 --> 37:14.833
Clear.

37:55.674 --> 37:56.842
Kate.

37:56.875 --> 37:57.976
Kate.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.378
I hear tapping.

37:59.411 --> 38:02.414
( muffled clanging )

38:07.553 --> 38:09.821
Petty Officer Swain?!

38:10.822 --> 38:12.023
Open it.

38:17.095 --> 38:17.929
Ready?

38:31.042 --> 38:32.411
Bunker One is cleared.

38:32.444 --> 38:33.412
What's everyone's status?

38:33.445 --> 38:35.046
KATE:
McGee and I are
almost done in Two.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.615
TONY:
I got a couple more, boss.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.816
GIBBS:
Keep me posted.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.050
Yup.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.372
Petty Officer Swain.

39:00.406 --> 39:01.740
You all right?

39:05.544 --> 39:07.479
Where's Brett?

39:07.513 --> 39:10.015
Well, you don't have
to worry about him.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.917
He's dead.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.387
You're safe now.

39:15.421 --> 39:16.922
Okay?

39:19.491 --> 39:21.026
( phone clicking )

39:21.059 --> 39:22.528
Boss.

39:22.561 --> 39:23.529
DiNozzo.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.397
I got her.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.065
Bunker Two, Corridor "C."

39:27.098 --> 39:28.366
She's all right, but...

39:30.769 --> 39:32.003
GIBBS:
DiNozzo?

39:32.037 --> 39:35.040
Tony? Tony, you there?

39:49.555 --> 39:50.856
Kate?

39:54.460 --> 39:56.528
Is it true?

39:56.562 --> 39:58.129
Brett's dead?

39:58.163 --> 40:00.699
Put the gun down,
Petty Officer.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.034
( sobs )

40:06.705 --> 40:09.808
We were supposed to get married.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.983
I don't think I can go on
without him.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.651
Kate?

40:19.685 --> 40:22.153
You've done everything that
Brett's asked, haven't you?

40:22.187 --> 40:24.690
I have.

40:24.723 --> 40:29.661
You wouldn't want to disappoint
him, would you?

40:31.129 --> 40:33.031
No.

40:36.502 --> 40:39.070
Doesn't the guide say

40:39.104 --> 40:43.008
that the good wife must carry on
in her husband's absence?

40:44.109 --> 40:47.178
Let me show you.

40:50.081 --> 40:53.819
( whimpering sobs )

41:04.095 --> 41:06.798
( sobbing grows louder )

41:11.202 --> 41:13.238
( moans gently )

41:19.911 --> 41:21.980
( moans )

41:22.013 --> 41:23.715
How's your head?

41:23.749 --> 41:25.083
Still throbbing.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.952
You know what bongos are?

41:26.985 --> 41:28.286
Yeah.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.288
Well a beatnik
is playing them
in my head.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.591
( laughs to herself )

41:32.624 --> 41:35.260
You finally met
the perfect '50s woman

41:35.293 --> 41:37.996
and she almost kills you,
DiNozzo.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.097
She was so obedient.

41:39.130 --> 41:42.167
Yeah, scary how impressed
you are by that.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.069
I find it hard
to believe

41:44.102 --> 41:46.572
how Chaplain Evans could have
such power over her.

41:46.605 --> 41:49.174
Classic Stockholm Syndrome.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.277
She formed an emotional
attachment to her captor.

41:52.310 --> 41:55.146
It'll take her time,
but she'll recover.

41:56.882 --> 41:59.050
DiNozzo, Kate, McGee,
M-TAC now!

41:59.084 --> 42:01.987
( under his breath ):
DiNozzo, Kate, McGee...

42:02.020 --> 42:05.123
( aloud ):
DiNozzo, Kate...

42:05.156 --> 42:07.192
McGee...

42:07.225 --> 42:09.861
Beatnik gone?

42:09.895 --> 42:11.162
Yeah.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.064
Cool.
