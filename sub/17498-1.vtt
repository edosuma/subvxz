00:36.266 --> 00:39.565
<i>It all started with
a small immigrant family.</i>

00:44.000 --> 00:47.499
<i>That's me, Alex Danyliuk.</i>

00:47.501 --> 00:52.332
<i>And that's my mom and dad,
Mr. and Mrs. Danyliuk.</i>

00:52.334 --> 00:55.766
<i>We left Ukraine
in search of a new life.</i>

00:55.768 --> 00:58.999
- Welcome to Canada.
- Thank you.

01:03.167 --> 01:05.099
<i>We couldn't afford
to live in the city,</i>

01:05.101 --> 01:09.232
<i>so we ended up in London...
London, Ontario.</i>

01:09.234 --> 01:12.832
<i>Of course, like most hopeful
immigrants, we found ourselves a house</i>

01:12.834 --> 01:15.432
<i>- that we couldn't
actually pay for...</i>

01:15.434 --> 01:17.899
<i>so things got worse.</i>

01:19.633 --> 01:21.766
<i>Mom and dad started
arguing a lot more.</i>

01:21.768 --> 01:24.133
<i>But eventually a Russian
friend of the family</i>

01:24.135 --> 01:26.932
<i>helped mom get a job as a
bookkeeper's assistant at a bank.</i>

01:26.934 --> 01:28.932
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:28.934 --> 01:30.866
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Danyliuk,
we're calling about</i>

01:30.868 --> 01:34.399
<i>- your overdue payments
on your line of credit.</i>

01:34.401 --> 01:36.565
<i>Please give us a call.</i>

01:39.266 --> 01:41.565
Don't touch anything.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.766
<i>But dad wasn't of much use.</i>

01:48.768 --> 01:51.265
<i>He tried, but people
didn't trust him.</i>

01:51.267 --> 01:54.399
<i>So we basically
lived on welfare.</i>

01:56.566 --> 01:58.198
<i>Everything my mom earned
went to pay off the mortgage.</i>

01:58.200 --> 02:01.999
<i>I didn't have any friends to
play with or socialize with</i>

02:02.001 --> 02:06.099
<i>except my mom's computer, and, to
be honest, we got along very well.</i>

02:06.101 --> 02:08.264
<i>I'm talking Internet,
video games, forums,</i>

02:08.267 --> 02:10.765
<i>chat rooms with random
strangers, all sorts of sites,</i>

02:10.768 --> 02:15.632
<i>easy access to information,
and infinite possibilities.</i>

02:18.666 --> 02:20.499
<i>It was this that made me
want to go to college.</i>

02:20.501 --> 02:24.032
<i>I wanted to follow in the footsteps
of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates</i>

02:24.034 --> 02:26.732
<i>and one day change the world
for the better.</i>

02:26.734 --> 02:28.966
<i>Fortunately, or unfortunately,</i>

02:28.968 --> 02:33.665
<i>I learned early on that I needed to
save up money for school myself.</i>

02:35.067 --> 02:38.099
<i>My very first dollars.</i>

02:47.199 --> 02:48.932
<i>My job was being a clicker.</i>

02:48.934 --> 02:51.499
<i>I'd build up traffic to sites
by changing my ip address</i>

02:51.501 --> 02:53.832
<i>and visiting the same site
over and over again.</i>

02:53.834 --> 02:57.298
<i>It was boring,
but it was easy money.</i>

02:57.300 --> 02:59.766
<i>For every 1,000 clicks,
I made $20.</i>

02:59.768 --> 03:05.866
<i>It wasn't a lot, but all big
things have small beginnings.</i>

03:05.868 --> 03:09.532
<i>Time went by, and I wanted to learn
more about how the world worked,</i>

03:09.534 --> 03:11.465
<i>especially the money world.</i>

03:11.467 --> 03:15.265
<i>The Internet was full of ideas and
opinions about the banking system,</i>

03:15.267 --> 03:18.332
<i>the financial crisis, the
vulnerability of the system,</i>

03:18.334 --> 03:20.332
<i>and about the need for change.</i>

03:21.901 --> 03:24.265
<i>But some things
just never changed.</i>

03:47.199 --> 03:49.665
<i>So that's how I grew up.</i>

03:49.667 --> 03:51.632
<i>As you can see,
it wasn't a fairy tale,</i>

03:51.634 --> 03:55.932
<i>but I was hoping
that would change.</i>

03:55.934 --> 03:57.899
Just a coffee, please.

03:57.901 --> 03:59.799
<i>Yesterday,
a cyber-attack</i>

03:59.801 --> 04:02.632
<i>was perpetrated on a number
of government sites and banks.</i>

04:02.634 --> 04:06.665
<i>Responsibility for this attack
was claimed by Darkweb,</i>

04:06.667 --> 04:10.232
<i>an online criminal organization
led by a hacker named zed.</i>

04:10.234 --> 04:12.832
<i>Now, he is considered to be
an international criminal</i>

04:12.834 --> 04:16.165
<i>implicated in dozens of cases
around the world.</i>

04:16.166 --> 04:19.665
<i>Now, this video was uploaded
claiming that responsibility.</i>

04:19.666 --> 04:21.565
<i>We are Darkweb.</i>

04:21.567 --> 04:25.098
<i>We will not stand by and allow slave
masters to control our lives.</i>

04:25.100 --> 04:29.432
<i>We will fight back. We will bring them
down. This is just the beginning.</i>

04:29.434 --> 04:36.031
<i>And in other news, the stock market has
been unstable due to these attacks.</i>

04:41.767 --> 04:43.399
Mom, I'm home.

04:48.266 --> 04:50.031
Mom?

04:50.768 --> 04:54.632
Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong?
What's wrong, huh?

04:58.833 --> 05:00.699
Okay, now, mom, that's bullshit.

05:01.634 --> 05:06.065
That bank owns the mortgage, and
now they know that I'm unemployed

05:06.067 --> 05:08.132
and I can't pay monthly bills.

05:08.134 --> 05:10.665
We will lose the house.

05:11.767 --> 05:14.365
Okay. Well,
what did dad say?

05:14.367 --> 05:18.499
Dad... he's asleep.

05:34.066 --> 05:37.065
Okay. Okay, mom.

05:37.666 --> 05:39.132
What is this?

05:39.134 --> 05:41.265
This is money.
All right, this'll last you

05:41.267 --> 05:44.031
for a few months, and then
after that, I can get more.

05:44.033 --> 05:46.298
Where did you get this?
Did you steal it?

05:46.300 --> 05:48.098
No, no, no.
I didn't steal it.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.532
I been saving up for college.

05:50.534 --> 05:55.365
But how? You never told us,
and... where did you get this?

05:55.367 --> 05:56.532
Mom, okay, that doesn't matter.

05:56.534 --> 05:59.332
What matters is we're
not going to lose the house.

05:59.334 --> 06:02.265
I can't take it.
You need to pay for school.

06:02.267 --> 06:04.399
Look, mom, please, okay,
I'm an adult.

06:04.401 --> 06:05.699
Okay, I can...
I can get a job.

06:05.701 --> 06:10.499
I can... I can make this back,
but, please, take it.

06:10.501 --> 06:13.998
What will I say to dad?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.399
Tell him the truth.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.365
<i>Thoughts were
rushing through my head.</i>

06:26.367 --> 06:28.499
<i>Why? For what?</i>

06:28.501 --> 06:31.399
<i>I hated the bank
that fired my mom.</i>

06:31.401 --> 06:33.098
<i>Even if the bank had
a hundred reasons,</i>

06:33.100 --> 06:34.365
<i>I still fucking hated them.</i>

06:34.367 --> 06:36.132
<i>I spent years saving up
that money.</i>

06:36.134 --> 06:39.198
<i>I put down a deposit for school, and
now I risked losing everything.</i>

06:39.200 --> 06:44.165
<i>I had to start over.
I didn't have years to spend.</i>

06:44.167 --> 06:49.432
<i>I needed something faster, but the
Internet was just full of scams.</i>

06:50.867 --> 06:54.732
<i>And then,
I remembered something.</i>

07:02.266 --> 07:06.065
<i>Darkweb was this online hacker group that
was getting a lot of news at the time.</i>

07:06.067 --> 07:08.732
<i>I was surprised that their site
hadn't been shut down.</i>

07:08.734 --> 07:10.799
<i>It all seemed
kind of simple at first.</i>

07:10.801 --> 07:13.865
<i>I just needed to make
an account and sign up.</i>

07:13.867 --> 07:17.098
<i>But real access wasn't
given out so easily.</i>

07:18.333 --> 07:20.432
"Soldier"?

07:34.099 --> 07:35.865
<i>They told me
to do something illegal,</i>

07:35.867 --> 07:37.732
<i>like stealing a person's
credit card number,</i>

07:37.734 --> 07:39.632
<i>and that was how
they verified the rookies.</i>

07:39.634 --> 07:40.965
<i>To me, this seemed simple,</i>

07:40.967 --> 07:43.799
<i>but I needed a victim,
and I had an idea.</i>

07:43.801 --> 07:45.898
<i>- There was
this one guy at school</i>

07:45.900 --> 07:48.799
<i>who really had it coming,
Randy Bickle.</i>

07:48.801 --> 07:52.265
Whoo! Maybe next time,
watch where you're going.

07:52.267 --> 07:53.931
What's your problem, man?

07:53.933 --> 07:55.699
What did you just say to me,
Dostoyevsky?

07:55.701 --> 07:58.432
I said why don't you pick on
somebody your own size, huh?

07:58.434 --> 08:00.165
You want to go? Huh?

08:00.167 --> 08:03.665
You want to go?
Huh? Huh?

08:03.667 --> 08:06.766
Yeah, next time, asshole.

08:07.566 --> 08:10.132
<i>What a dumb-ass.</i>

08:10.134 --> 08:12.831
<i>I built a pretty simple site
that sold fake supplements,</i>

08:12.833 --> 08:15.632
<i>and Randy fell for it.
He used his dad's credit card,</i>

08:15.634 --> 08:17.632
<i>and it had a lot of money on it.</i>

08:17.634 --> 08:20.798
Dad! Can I use your credit card?

08:22.400 --> 08:25.098
Yes.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.732
<i>I leaked the information to
Darkweb, and before I knew it,</i>

08:27.734 --> 08:30.031
<i>one of their guys was
communicating with me.</i>

08:49.333 --> 08:53.198
<i>This guy who called himself
Roosevelt gave me low-level access.</i>

08:53.200 --> 08:57.465
<i>In reality, it was more of
a job, black market trading.</i>

08:57.467 --> 08:59.465
<i>His prices were much lower
than market value,</i>

08:59.467 --> 09:02.332
<i>and this made it easy
to find buyers.</i>

09:02.334 --> 09:05.165
<i>First time around, he sent me a
couple of powerful gaming laptops,</i>

09:05.167 --> 09:07.499
<i>and I just had to sell them,</i>

09:07.501 --> 09:10.098
<i>so I went on Craigslist
and found a buyer.</i>

09:10.100 --> 09:13.365
<i>This guy was a small-town gamer
who liked to play for money,</i>

09:13.367 --> 09:15.165
<i>but I didn't care who he was.</i>

09:15.167 --> 09:20.165
<i>Most importantly, he had
the cash that I needed.</i>

09:24.299 --> 09:27.165
<i>I'd never made this much money
at once.</i>

09:27.167 --> 09:30.499
<i>I sent Roosevelt his cut and
bought myself a new laptop.</i>

09:30.501 --> 09:33.432
<i>In other words,
I was in business,</i>

09:33.434 --> 09:35.998
<i>and I liked it a lot.</i>

09:36.000 --> 09:38.565
<i>Roosevelt kept sending me
things, and I kept selling 'em</i>

09:38.567 --> 09:39.898
<i>and making the money
that I needed.</i>

09:39.900 --> 09:42.699
<i>The products were always
something simple</i>

09:42.701 --> 09:45.499
<i>phones, jewelry,
watches, laptops...</i>

09:45.501 --> 09:48.132
<i>- easy to carry,</i>

09:48.134 --> 09:49.765
<i>easy money.</i>

09:55.799 --> 09:58.432
<i>But there were other ways
of making money, too.</i>

09:58.434 --> 10:01.599
<i>Forums that kept a list of
vulnerable online shopping sites,</i>

10:01.601 --> 10:04.565
<i>and they were easy
to break into.</i>

10:04.567 --> 10:06.198
<i>I didn't want
to cross that line,</i>

10:06.200 --> 10:07.465
<i>but these companies
had insurance,</i>

10:07.467 --> 10:09.298
<i>so there really
wasn't too much damage.</i>

10:09.300 --> 10:13.465
<i>I pulled a few hundred credit
cards and sold them on Darkweb.</i>

10:18.133 --> 10:21.965
<i>I would have used these cards myself,
but I needed fake I.D.S to match them,</i>

10:21.967 --> 10:25.132
<i>so I was happy to get
whatever I could for them.</i>

10:26.866 --> 10:29.698
<i>Took me four years
to save up 30 grand.</i>

10:29.700 --> 10:34.931
<i>This time, I did it in four
weeks, and now I was ready.</i>

10:39.500 --> 10:42.399
So I'll call you guys
when I get there.

10:42.401 --> 10:44.798
Be careful.

10:50.899 --> 10:52.565
All right.

10:52.567 --> 10:57.165
And I'm going to be sending
you guys money every month,

10:57.167 --> 11:01.232
so... spend some time together.

11:01.234 --> 11:03.898
Look after each other.

11:10.233 --> 11:14.499
<i>I left my parents behind and
took the bus to the big city.</i>

11:14.501 --> 11:16.865
<i>I wasn't sure if I'd made
the right decision,</i>

11:16.867 --> 11:19.664
<i>but it was too late to go back.</i>

11:38.599 --> 11:41.532
<i>It was pretty cool
to move to Toronto.</i>

11:41.534 --> 11:43.998
<i>Everything was bigger.</i>

11:48.766 --> 11:50.132
Welcome to your new home,
Mr. Sawyer.

11:50.134 --> 11:54.798
The building has 24-hour
security, has a shared rooftop.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.865
There's a loading dock
around the back.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.132
You've got all brand-new
stainless steel appliances,

11:59.134 --> 12:00.465
floor-to-ceiling windows.

12:00.467 --> 12:02.365
The neighborhood is absolutely
up-and-coming.

12:02.367 --> 12:04.965
There's not much more
you could get.

12:04.967 --> 12:06.564
Do you have any questions?

12:06.566 --> 12:09.564
Yeah, how do I connect
to the Internet?

12:09.566 --> 12:11.731
<i>Unfortunately,
my payment was late,</i>

12:11.733 --> 12:14.965
<i>and the university said I could
only start in January.</i>

12:14.967 --> 12:17.132
<i>That meant I needed money
to live.</i>

12:17.999 --> 12:19.631
<i>I'd made enough money
for Roosevelt</i>

12:19.633 --> 12:21.765
<i>that he increased
my access on Darkweb.</i>

12:21.767 --> 12:23.731
<i>I could now buy credit card
numbers and fake I.D.S</i>

12:23.733 --> 12:27.765
<i>and use 'em for online shopping.</i>

12:39.032 --> 12:41.965
<i>Next station
is St. George.</i>

12:44.500 --> 12:47.731
- I'm expecting a package.
- Okay.

12:49.799 --> 12:51.664
Yeah. Let me check it out.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.631
Yeah, this should be it.

13:10.766 --> 13:11.664
Okay.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.865
Just sign right there.

13:14.867 --> 13:16.831
Sure.

13:16.833 --> 13:19.132
And there we go,
Mr. Munchausen.

13:19.134 --> 13:20.664
Thank you.

13:22.632 --> 13:24.531
Can you take me to Chinatown?

13:33.233 --> 13:34.965
<i>But things weren't so simple.</i>

13:36.999 --> 13:39.465
<i>I couldn't use Craigslist
to find buyers in the city.</i>

13:39.467 --> 13:42.031
<i>Too many cops and fakes,
so I tried my luck</i>

13:42.033 --> 13:44.765
<i>with a few pawnshops
and jewelry stores.</i>

13:58.999 --> 14:00.698
Hey.

14:00.700 --> 14:04.399
You... you speak English, yeah?

14:04.401 --> 14:08.399
I... I have watches.

14:09.565 --> 14:13.098
Okay?
I want to sell them.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.132
Do you want to buy them?

14:16.732 --> 14:21.065
Look, these are real...
These are real watches, okay?

14:21.067 --> 14:26.798
This cost... this cost $15,000.
I sell for... for ten.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.698
- Thousand?
- Yes.

14:31.367 --> 14:34.631
- W-what's that?
- No, no, no. Look, look.

14:34.633 --> 14:37.598
See, these are real watch,
too, okay?

14:37.600 --> 14:41.865
I sell these to you
for 200 bucks.

15:12.266 --> 15:14.398
Ten. Ten. I got...
There's three watches.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.965
- Now ten.

15:19.465 --> 15:22.065
Hey, wait.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.998
- Hey.
- What can I do for you?

15:45.932 --> 15:48.898
Says here you purchased these three
days ago. How come you're selling 'em?

15:48.900 --> 15:52.232
I... you know, I just
didn't want 'em anymore.

15:52.234 --> 15:56.831
I can't. I lost the card that
I used to purchase 'em, so...

15:56.833 --> 15:58.398
Well, wait for
a replacement card.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.598
I mean, surely it's worth the wait
rather than losing money on the resale.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.965
Look, do you want to buy them,
or do you not?

16:04.967 --> 16:08.664
Okay. Mr... Munchausen...

16:08.666 --> 16:12.431
We're going to need two pieces
of I.D. And a proof of address.

16:12.433 --> 16:13.865
Bank statement is fine.

16:13.867 --> 16:15.631
Then we're going to get you
to sign a form

16:15.633 --> 16:17.531
stating that
these were not stolen,

16:17.533 --> 16:19.631
at which point,
we'll review your application.

16:19.633 --> 16:22.398
If everything checks out,
then you can come back,

16:22.400 --> 16:23.531
and we'll make the purchase.

16:23.533 --> 16:25.265
- You can't just buy 'em now?
- Sorry.

16:25.267 --> 16:27.631
You know, I can drop the price,
by another thousand.

16:27.633 --> 16:32.965
Hey, you know, don't worry about it.
I'll just... I'll keep them for now.

16:32.967 --> 16:35.865
Sure.

16:55.665 --> 16:57.331
You having a rough day?

16:57.333 --> 16:59.831
Sorry. Do I know you?

16:59.833 --> 17:01.198
Sye.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.330
Hey, I just wanted to talk
to you about your watches.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.232
No, no, no.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.865
I'm not a cop.
I'm not a cop.

17:08.867 --> 17:12.165
I just might want
to buy your watches.

17:14.464 --> 17:15.964
Yeah, what do you want
to talk about?

17:15.967 --> 17:17.897
Look, if it'll help,

17:17.900 --> 17:20.397
I'll give you five grand
for all of 'em.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.830
I'm not an idiot.
Thirty grand.

17:23.833 --> 17:25.065
Seven.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.431
Thirty grand.

17:27.531 --> 17:29.132
All right, tell you what.

17:29.134 --> 17:31.364
I go in there.

17:31.366 --> 17:33.031
I sell 'em for at least 30,000.

17:33.033 --> 17:36.098
I take 30 percent off the top.

17:38.166 --> 17:40.765
All right, but you get the money
today, huh. Otherwise...

17:40.767 --> 17:42.898
Otherwise, you take
your watches and go.

17:44.099 --> 17:47.165
Hey, look, the watches
are stolen anyway, right?

17:48.232 --> 17:50.531
So what do you got to lose?

17:53.766 --> 17:56.531
- All right. Yeah.
- Yeah, all right. Let's go.

17:59.265 --> 18:00.731
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Wait.

18:00.733 --> 18:03.765
I go in alone, all right?

18:13.599 --> 18:17.264
Hey, Christopher!
Look who it is.

18:17.266 --> 18:19.664
How you doing, buddy boy?

18:49.365 --> 18:51.965
What the hell?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.398
Aw, you dick.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.898
That's rude.

18:55.900 --> 18:59.598
Come on.
Walk with me.

19:01.799 --> 19:03.498
What happened back there?

19:03.500 --> 19:05.798
What? Exactly what I said
I was going to do...

19:05.800 --> 19:07.564
No, you disappeared, though.

19:07.566 --> 19:09.164
Yeah, I went out
the back door. Here.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.297
You didn't tell me you were
going to go out the back door.

19:11.299 --> 19:12.965
What's this?

19:12.967 --> 19:16.464
$24,500 in very dirty 20s.

19:16.466 --> 19:19.731
Well, it would have taken a while
to get fifties and hundreds.

19:19.733 --> 19:22.898
But you sold my watches
for 35,000?

19:22.900 --> 19:25.765
Receipt's in the bag.

19:25.767 --> 19:30.131
See, now you don't strike me as some student
who has very expensive taste in watches,

19:30.133 --> 19:34.965
and you don't seem like a thief, so I'm
thinking to myself, "who is this kid?"

19:37.699 --> 19:40.398
How'd you do that so fast?

19:41.198 --> 19:42.631
I'll tell you

19:42.633 --> 19:45.798
if you tell me how
you got those watches.

19:47.966 --> 19:51.698
Hey, hey, don't worry.
It's all in there.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.898
I promise.

19:55.599 --> 19:57.998
Okay.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.598
Yeah.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.664
<i>And that was how I met sye.</i>

20:02.666 --> 20:04.498
And you want to approach
every buyer differently.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.065
I know that sounds simple,
but it is important,

20:07.067 --> 20:10.031
because you say the wrong thing,
you could lose credibility.

20:10.033 --> 20:12.331
You know, you could get
blacklisted real quick.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.464
You don't want to do that.

20:14.466 --> 20:17.031
You're still working
in these conditions, eh?

20:17.033 --> 20:18.965
I mean, it takes a lot of
strength to do what you guys do.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.898
You should give yourselves
a pat on the back.

20:20.900 --> 20:23.664
You guys are troopers. And you
know who else shares my opinion?

20:23.666 --> 20:27.598
Your wives, your parents,
your sons and daughters,

20:27.600 --> 20:30.798
and I think that you should
be able to call them.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.264
Now, you ever use one of these?

20:33.266 --> 20:36.331
<i>But if you can put yourself
in the shoes of the buyer,</i>

20:36.333 --> 20:38.564
whew, you're gold.

20:43.899 --> 20:45.998
Thank you very much.

20:47.266 --> 20:51.664
<i>And then there are also people, you
know, sometimes people in high places</i>

20:51.666 --> 20:52.965
that you... you don't
think are on the market,

20:52.967 --> 20:57.064
and they're not until you find
them something they like.

20:57.066 --> 21:00.965
All right, what we have for you gentlemen,
nothing short of extraordinary.

21:00.967 --> 21:06.264
So we got monochrome
LCD display, USB interface,

21:06.266 --> 21:09.231
20 megabytes of built-in memory.
It's got an electronic compass.

21:09.233 --> 21:10.865
More importantly, your friends
will be really impressed

21:10.867 --> 21:14.464
as to how you actually
got your hands on 'em, so...

21:14.466 --> 21:16.064
Who'd you steal from this time?

21:16.066 --> 21:18.564
I know someone works
for the watch company.

21:18.566 --> 21:20.297
I'm getting 'em
for a good price.

21:20.299 --> 21:21.564
How many have you got?

21:21.566 --> 21:26.398
Two for you.
Eight for your friends.

21:28.766 --> 21:31.097
Yeah, we'll take 'em.

21:31.099 --> 21:32.965
<i>Now then,
there's your longtime buyer.</i>

21:32.967 --> 21:36.297
<i>Now, you always got
to make them happy.</i>

21:36.299 --> 21:37.798
<i>You got to keep
bringing 'em stuff,</i>

21:37.800 --> 21:40.931
because trust is the most important
commodity in this business, all right?

21:40.933 --> 21:44.798
Takes a long time to build, but
you can lose it just like that.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.398
What's up?

21:46.400 --> 21:48.498
- Hey, I'm Chris, by the way.
- Hi.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.097
So what can I do for you?

21:52.732 --> 21:53.831
Boom.

21:58.665 --> 22:01.531
<i>In just a couple months,
we made about 60 grand.</i>

22:01.533 --> 22:02.831
That's your half.

22:02.833 --> 22:05.798
<i>I sent some money to my parents
and saved the rest,</i>

22:05.800 --> 22:11.931
<i>the criminal mastermind behind last
night's cyber-attack on the world bank</i>

22:11.933 --> 22:15.997
<i>has claimed responsibility for
what he calls an act of justice.</i>

22:15.999 --> 22:20.498
<i>But authorities say the breach
in security was substantial.</i>

22:20.500 --> 22:23.364
<i>The banks of this world have
enslaved their citizens</i>

22:23.366 --> 22:28.398
<i>and then quietly stand back and let the people
suffer under the weight of their debts.</i>

22:28.400 --> 22:30.364
<i>That is not the fault
of the people.</i>

22:30.366 --> 22:32.698
<i>It is the manufactured sin
of the bank.</i>

22:32.700 --> 22:34.531
<i>A drug addict makes a mistake,</i>

22:34.533 --> 22:36.564
<i>but the drug dealer
commits the crime.</i>

22:36.566 --> 22:39.197
<i>Banks and bankers,
watch your backs.</i>

22:39.199 --> 22:41.364
<i>Darkweb is coming after you.</i>

22:43.433 --> 22:46.131
<i>I thought about these words</i>

22:46.133 --> 22:49.598
<i>and realized a university life
wasn't for me.</i>

22:50.866 --> 22:51.964
Hey.

22:51.966 --> 22:54.331
If you... if you haven't
bought all your books yet,

22:54.333 --> 22:56.698
these'll save you a few bucks.

22:58.766 --> 23:02.664
<i>So I called up sye and asked
him for help with another job.</i>

23:02.666 --> 23:05.364
<i>I told him I wanted
to try something bigger,</i>

23:05.366 --> 23:11.297
<i>forums had a blacklist of corrupt
bankers who were going to get punished,</i>

23:11.299 --> 23:12.930
<i>but we needed to get
into their wallets,</i>

23:12.932 --> 23:14.997
<i>'cause their online information
was highly protected.</i>

23:14.999 --> 23:16.865
Hey, sweetie.

23:21.065 --> 23:22.698
I think I got some friends
that could help.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.897
<i>You know, I'm sure
it'll surprise you,</i>

23:24.899 --> 23:27.798
<i>but the single most important
people that I get to know,</i>

23:27.800 --> 23:29.431
<i>people in the service industry.</i>

23:29.433 --> 23:31.698
Anybody that knows anybody,
right,

23:31.700 --> 23:34.164
those are the people who are going
to help you get to the people

23:34.166 --> 23:38.331
that are staying there at the
hotel or at the restaurant.

23:38.333 --> 23:41.997
These are the people
that you need to know.

23:47.132 --> 23:49.498
<i>Like I said, these
bankers were all corrupt.</i>

23:49.500 --> 23:54.664
<i>Darkweb wanted to punish them, so I wanted
to pitch in to fight for the cause.</i>

23:54.666 --> 23:58.464
<i>Nobody knew that I was doing
it, and that was the point.</i>

23:58.466 --> 24:01.131
<i>-We were anonymous.</i>

24:02.998 --> 24:06.930
- Just got another one. I'm going
to send it to you. -Nice.

24:06.932 --> 24:10.097
<i>And of course I couldn't have
done it without sye.</i>

24:10.099 --> 24:13.664
<i>He knew a lot of people
in a lot of different places.</i>

24:18.831 --> 24:20.897
Hey, Chavez.
How you doing, man?

24:28.565 --> 24:30.164
Boys!

24:31.666 --> 24:33.631
Oh, Robin, come to me,

24:33.633 --> 24:36.498
you saucy little minx, you.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.164
Mwah. Mwah.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.431
Where have you been all my life?

24:39.433 --> 24:40.798
Well, you never
come around anymore.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.331
Thought you started
playing for the other team.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.731
Very funny.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.731
Robin, this is my friend, Alex.

24:47.733 --> 24:50.631
Alex has never been
to a strip club before.

24:50.633 --> 24:52.765
You're not missing anything,
sweetie.

24:52.767 --> 24:55.164
So remember that fat-cat banker
I was talking to you about?

24:55.166 --> 24:58.331
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He comes in
here all the time, so no problem.

24:58.333 --> 25:00.131
I'll get one of the girls
to work him.

25:00.133 --> 25:01.997
So, I have something else
for you.

25:01.999 --> 25:04.964
This guy comes in last night.
He's with a bunch of people.

25:04.966 --> 25:07.930
They're throwing money around.
Think he was Colombian.

25:07.932 --> 25:11.030
Anyways, everything was fine.
The girls were making money.

25:11.032 --> 25:15.398
But then he tried to force himself on
one of the girls, so I stepped in.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.765
Anyways, he left his card here.

25:16.767 --> 25:19.264
None of us were so keen
on giving it back to him,

25:19.266 --> 25:21.564
- so there you go.
- Hmm.

25:22.465 --> 25:23.698
Holy shit, that's an infinity.

25:23.700 --> 25:24.997
What does that mean?

25:24.999 --> 25:26.964
Means it's got a shitload
of money on it.

25:26.966 --> 25:27.731
We can use it at stores.

25:27.733 --> 25:29.531
Knock yourselves out, boys.

25:29.533 --> 25:31.231
Wait. Whoa! How much
money you want for it?

25:31.233 --> 25:32.864
Nothing!
It's a gift.

25:32.866 --> 25:36.997
Just make sure you punish
that asshole.

25:36.999 --> 25:39.131
I love you.

25:40.765 --> 25:42.464
I love her.

25:46.465 --> 25:49.231
- No.
- What?

25:49.233 --> 25:51.830
We can't take money off that
card. It's too dangerous.

25:51.832 --> 25:53.930
What are you talking about?
I wasn't even...

25:53.932 --> 25:57.064
All right, look, man.
It is easy money.

25:57.066 --> 25:59.764
You said so yourself. It's got a
shit-ton of money on it, right?

25:59.766 --> 26:01.498
- Yeah, but...
- So why don't we...

26:01.500 --> 26:03.664
So what's $20,000, $30,000
to this guy, huh?

26:03.666 --> 26:05.797
So we'll just, you know,
get a fake I.D.,

26:05.799 --> 26:10.664
put on a disguise,
go the bank, boom.

26:10.666 --> 26:13.997
And then we will never
touch it again.

26:13.999 --> 26:16.498
I promise.

26:22.765 --> 26:24.498
I should be the one
going in there.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.930
I look way more Colombian
than you do.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.797
Just don't stress me out, man.
Come on.

26:27.799 --> 26:30.097
Well, maybe you're right.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

26:30.099 --> 26:32.964
What if the guy already
reported the card stolen?

26:32.966 --> 26:34.364
I'm already checking.

26:34.366 --> 26:37.297
What? What are you doing?

26:37.299 --> 26:38.398
I'm using the card
to buy a song.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.331
It only costs 99 cents,
but if it works,

26:40.333 --> 26:42.051
that means we know
the card's still working.

26:47.632 --> 26:49.531
Okay, done. It works.

26:49.533 --> 26:52.631
All right, you sure
you want to do this?

26:53.998 --> 26:56.431
All right, now you got to be
confident, all right?

26:56.433 --> 26:59.030
Don't mess with your clothes. Just
act like you belong, all right?

26:59.032 --> 27:01.131
- Okay. -This rental
was really expensive.

27:01.133 --> 27:03.431
- You better make it worth it.
- I got it, I got it.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.564
All right. No pressure.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.164
Go, go, go, go!
Drive! Drive!

28:05.166 --> 28:06.398
What happened?!
What happened?!

28:06.400 --> 28:09.630
Relax. We're in the money.

29:46.166 --> 29:49.897
<i>and I wanted to find a way
to kick them in the balls.</i>

29:49.899 --> 29:53.630
<i>They'd never know it's me,
but again, that was the point.</i>

29:53.632 --> 29:57.563
Hey, sye, you think you could
help me with a job?

30:00.598 --> 30:02.830
I want to cause a little chaos
in the bank,

30:02.832 --> 30:05.064
and I want to do something
that'll disrupt their system,

30:05.066 --> 30:08.930
stall 'em for weeks, something
that'll make them close their doors.

30:08.932 --> 30:12.231
Sounds good, but I don't get it.
Where are we making our money?

30:12.233 --> 30:14.663
Oh, it's not always
about the money, sye.

30:14.665 --> 30:17.997
All right, this time,
it's about payback.

30:19.664 --> 30:20.764
What do you need me to do?

30:20.766 --> 30:22.663
Well...

30:24.731 --> 30:26.630
You look good.
Confidence.

30:26.632 --> 30:29.264
- Not too confident.
- Yep. Yep.

30:29.266 --> 30:30.331
Remember, confidence.

30:30.333 --> 30:34.663
<i>I'll go into the bank
and pretend to be a new client.</i>

30:34.665 --> 30:37.064
<i>I've already been inside,
so I know where I need to sit.</i>

30:37.066 --> 30:40.830
<i>Just before lunch, I'll go in as
though I'm asking for a loan.</i>

30:40.832 --> 30:44.530
<i>The only thing is I need
to chat up this banker girl.</i>

30:44.532 --> 30:46.997
<i>And that's where you come in.</i>

30:46.999 --> 30:49.730
Hi. Can I help you?

30:49.732 --> 30:52.497
- Can you do a British accent?
- Uh... probably.

30:52.499 --> 30:55.364
- If you can, do a British accent.
- Why?

30:55.366 --> 30:57.563
Chicks love it.
She'll fall for it on the spot.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.964
- You sure?
- Works every time, mate.

30:59.966 --> 31:02.597
I'd like to inquire about a
loan for a small business.

31:02.599 --> 31:05.164
Oh, okay. So that would be
a commercial loan.

31:05.166 --> 31:07.663
- Do you have an account
with us already? -No.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.964
Okay, so we have a couple
of different products

31:09.966 --> 31:13.398
I can talk to you about. So, why don't
I get some basic information from you.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.697
You know what I just noticed? You have the
most beautifully symmetrical facial features.

31:16.699 --> 31:18.797
It's really...
You'd be great in movies.

31:18.799 --> 31:22.797
- Oh. -Actually, I have
a director friend

31:22.799 --> 31:25.730
<i>who would be happy to audition
you for his next film.</i>

31:25.732 --> 31:28.530
- Oh.
- Just crossed my mind, you know?

31:29.899 --> 31:32.897
Okay. Can I get
your name from you?

31:32.899 --> 31:34.897
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

31:34.899 --> 31:36.897
I'm so sorry.

31:36.899 --> 31:39.830
- No, that's okay. Don't worry about it.
- No, no, no.

31:44.464 --> 31:47.930
- Really have a lot of pens.

31:51.398 --> 31:53.597
- Sorry.
- That's fine.

31:53.599 --> 31:55.030
Why don't I try
to open an account for you?

31:55.032 --> 31:59.797
- Sure. -Let me just,
uh, type the date in.

32:03.298 --> 32:05.897
Oh. That's strange.

32:05.899 --> 32:07.463
Oh, that's weird.

32:08.098 --> 32:09.463
There seems to be a problem.

32:09.465 --> 32:10.430
Something wrong?

32:10.432 --> 32:11.864
There's a problem here.

32:11.866 --> 32:13.430
Um...

32:13.432 --> 32:15.730
That is strange.

32:15.732 --> 32:18.497
Don't know what that's
all about.

32:18.499 --> 32:20.264
Looks like it's lunchtime
for you, so I might...

32:20.266 --> 32:21.897
I can go, and I can
come back later.

32:21.899 --> 32:23.730
Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.

32:23.732 --> 32:25.131
Good luck.

32:25.133 --> 32:26.697
Carol.

32:26.699 --> 32:29.297
Carol, there's something wrong.
There's...

32:29.299 --> 32:30.897
<i>And then, once I'm done,</i>

32:30.899 --> 32:32.764
<i>I'm going to quietly walk out of
the bank and head to the car,</i>

32:32.766 --> 32:35.530
<i>and no one will suspect a thing.</i>

32:37.365 --> 32:41.231
- Sir. Excuse me, sir.
- <i>-Fuck.</i>

32:41.233 --> 32:43.264
Excuse me.
Can you come with us?

32:43.266 --> 32:44.530
What's wrong?

32:44.532 --> 32:45.997
We have a small security issue.

32:45.999 --> 32:47.697
Oh, that's terrible.
What kind of security issue?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.377
Won't take very long.
Please, come with us.

32:51.531 --> 32:54.563
Hey! Hey!

32:55.498 --> 32:57.897
Excuse me!

32:59.498 --> 33:01.663
Excuse me! Officer!

33:08.931 --> 33:10.597
Alex and sye...

33:10.599 --> 33:13.131
I appreciate your Patience.

33:13.133 --> 33:15.897
I'm head of security
at this bank.

33:15.899 --> 33:18.730
Oh, actually, sye,
you can leave. Thank you.

33:18.732 --> 33:21.363
I think I'm going
to stay with my friend.

33:21.365 --> 33:23.363
Yeah, absolutely not.

33:23.365 --> 33:25.797
Sye, it's okay.
I got this.

33:26.498 --> 33:28.830
Yeah, it's okay.

33:33.431 --> 33:36.864
Um-hmm.

33:38.098 --> 33:42.397
Ah, that's a pretty cool
little thing you got here.

33:42.399 --> 33:43.797
Did you make it yourself?

33:43.799 --> 33:45.530
I'm not saying anything
without a lawyer.

33:45.532 --> 33:49.764
Well, first of all, you don't have a
lawyer, and you can't afford one.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.797
Secondly, I'm not the police,

33:51.799 --> 33:54.064
so you can open
right up with me.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.030
Did you make this yourself?

33:57.098 --> 33:58.397
I wrote the software.

33:58.399 --> 34:01.097
Ah. Not bad for a young kid.

34:01.099 --> 34:02.830
Where'd you get it?

34:02.832 --> 34:06.231
Online.

34:06.233 --> 34:09.164
Where online?

34:10.965 --> 34:14.231
We're going to charge you
with breaking and entering,

34:14.232 --> 34:19.563
Cyberterrorism, and conspiracy to commit
credit card fraud on the federal level.

34:19.565 --> 34:22.097
You're looking at five to ten
years in prison,

34:22.099 --> 34:27.897
and you will not be allowed to touch another
computer again for the rest of your life.

34:29.563 --> 34:35.063
I mean, of course unless you want to
tell me where you... you bought this.

34:39.364 --> 34:43.630
Fine. Then I will
call the police.

34:45.132 --> 34:46.996
Hey, sir, can I ask your name?

34:46.998 --> 34:48.797
Curtis. Yeah.

34:48.799 --> 34:52.362
Is that your... is that your
first or your last name?

34:52.364 --> 34:53.996
Both.

34:53.998 --> 34:56.030
Okay, Mr. Curtis,
can you...

34:56.032 --> 34:58.764
Can put the phone down
for a second, please?

35:01.464 --> 35:03.230
You have exactly one minute.

35:03.232 --> 35:06.430
Look, this was just a prank, okay?
I wasn't trying to...

35:06.432 --> 35:08.230
I wasn't trying
to steal anything.

35:08.232 --> 35:10.363
Your security system is awful.

35:10.365 --> 35:12.230
Firewall's outdated.

35:12.232 --> 35:13.630
The software that I created

35:13.632 --> 35:16.530
was able to put a virus
in the system very easily.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.397
I mean, it doesn't look good
for you if an 18-year-old

35:18.399 --> 35:21.030
was able to break in to the bank
and steal all this information.

35:21.032 --> 35:23.830
I mean, bank like this
should be more secure.

35:23.832 --> 35:26.597
Okay.

35:26.599 --> 35:31.697
Okay, what... what I'm
suggesting is, uh,

35:33.865 --> 35:37.697
you let me upgrade
the software for free.

35:37.699 --> 35:41.830
You can tell everyone that, you
know, that you had a security test

35:41.832 --> 35:43.730
and you brought me in
to fix the problem.

35:43.732 --> 35:46.697
Bank'll look bulletproof, your
bosses will be thanking you,

35:46.699 --> 35:51.830
and in exchange, all I ask is that you let
my friend and I just walk out of here,

35:51.832 --> 35:54.864
and we can all pretend like
none of this ever happened.

35:56.031 --> 35:59.930
Does that seem... fair?

36:03.331 --> 36:05.663
What the hell happened in there? Why'd
they let you go? What'd you tell 'em?

36:05.665 --> 36:07.563
I told them I wouldn't do it
again. They let me go.

36:07.565 --> 36:09.296
Wait. That's all you said?

36:09.298 --> 36:10.930
Yeah. Thought you'd be happy.

36:10.932 --> 36:13.463
Just seems a little bit
too easy. That's all.

36:13.465 --> 36:17.064
<i>I wanted to punish
this bank, and I failed.</i>

36:19.399 --> 36:21.030
<i>But some people
didn't see it that way.</i>

36:21.032 --> 36:23.864
<i>Someone leaked information
on Darkweb,</i>

36:23.866 --> 36:26.930
<i>and everyone knew it was me.</i>

36:30.765 --> 36:32.730
<i>At first, I was worried
that I'd get in trouble,</i>

36:32.732 --> 36:36.130
<i>but apparently people
were impressed.</i>

36:37.564 --> 36:39.363
<i>Even the head
of Darkweb noticed.</i>

36:39.365 --> 36:42.196
No way. Sye. Sye.
Sye, wake up, man.

36:42.198 --> 36:43.430
Hey.

36:43.432 --> 36:44.830
Look at this.
I just got a like from zed.

36:44.832 --> 36:45.930
You like who?

36:45.932 --> 36:47.697
No, no, zed,
the guy I told you about.

36:47.699 --> 36:49.163
He just sent me a like.
Look at that.

36:49.165 --> 36:52.530
I'm happy for you.

36:55.164 --> 36:58.463
<i>I'd never gotten this
kind of attention before.</i>

36:58.465 --> 37:00.263
<i>Apparently, what I did
was pretty ballsy,</i>

37:00.265 --> 37:01.597
<i>'cause I actually went
into the bank,</i>

37:01.599 --> 37:04.263
<i>whereas most break-ins
happen remotely.</i>

37:04.265 --> 37:06.930
<i>That's why he noticed me.</i>

37:12.231 --> 37:14.030
Dude, you're famous.

37:14.032 --> 37:17.630
Huh? What...
Hey, what are you doing, man?

37:17.632 --> 37:22.296
I just got you... a date.

37:22.298 --> 37:24.597
What the hell?

37:24.599 --> 37:26.397
What? She wants to
meet up with you.

37:26.399 --> 37:27.764
She said she's got some ideas

37:27.766 --> 37:29.363
on how you guys can work
together. Cute, right?

37:29.365 --> 37:32.096
What, you set me up on, like,
a date with a random stranger?

37:32.098 --> 37:33.497
I mean, we got to lay low, man.

37:33.499 --> 37:35.563
No, you need to get laid.

37:35.565 --> 37:38.296
I mean come on.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.597
What's the worst
that could happen?

37:43.431 --> 37:45.363
So you're Kira, huh?

37:45.365 --> 37:47.663
Yeah, but it's not my real name.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.930
Where are you from?

37:49.932 --> 37:52.029
I don't give out
my personal information.

37:52.031 --> 37:55.363
Okay. Then what are we
supposed to talk about?

37:55.365 --> 37:57.029
Where are you from?

37:57.031 --> 37:58.463
I'm from London.

37:58.465 --> 37:59.897
I don't hear an accent.

37:59.899 --> 38:01.530
London, Ontario.

38:01.532 --> 38:03.764
Really? That sucks.

38:03.766 --> 38:06.830
Thank you. Thanks.

38:06.832 --> 38:09.764
Um... so when's
your birthday?

38:09.766 --> 38:12.964
It's the 23rd of June, 1993.

38:12.966 --> 38:15.263
See? You're an idiot.

38:15.265 --> 38:16.630
Excuse me?

38:16.632 --> 38:19.764
I know your name, where you're
from, and your birth date.

38:19.766 --> 38:22.864
With that information, I could steal
your identity and ruin your life.

38:22.866 --> 38:25.363
It'd be a shame for someone
like you to go down like that.

38:25.365 --> 38:27.230
Someone like me?

38:27.232 --> 38:32.029
I mean, you might as well tell me what your
mother's maiden name is or her occupation.

38:32.031 --> 38:33.930
She doesn't have one.

38:35.398 --> 38:37.330
- That's rough.
- Yeah, but she's...

38:37.332 --> 38:40.697
She's tied to our house with,
you know, mortgage by the bank

38:40.699 --> 38:42.630
that fired her little while ago,

38:42.632 --> 38:45.029
and they know she couldn't even
afford it if she had the job.

38:45.031 --> 38:49.163
They say the drug addict makes the mistake,
but the drug dealer commits the crime.

38:49.165 --> 38:52.163
Did you just quote zed?

38:52.165 --> 38:55.463
Yeah, I did.
Do you follow him?

38:55.465 --> 38:58.697
Well, yeah, doesn't everybody?

38:58.699 --> 39:02.130
No. Most people are in it
for the money.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.830
Huh.

39:06.331 --> 39:10.063
So, have you met him?

39:10.065 --> 39:12.597
Um, I almost met him.

39:12.599 --> 39:14.463
"Almost"?
What does that mean?

39:14.465 --> 39:17.130
If you want to meet zed,

39:17.132 --> 39:19.363
you have to do something big.

39:21.098 --> 39:22.797
Are you going to answer that?

39:22.799 --> 39:24.730
Yeah. Sorry.

39:25.865 --> 39:27.263
Yeah.

39:27.265 --> 39:28.363
Are you banging her yet?

39:28.365 --> 39:30.063
I...

39:30.065 --> 39:31.230
No, hey, I'm just kidding.

39:31.232 --> 39:32.996
I'm just kidding. Just kidding.

39:32.998 --> 39:34.263
<i>Listen. I've got an idea.</i>

39:34.265 --> 39:36.063
Uh-huh. Okay, what is it?

39:36.065 --> 39:39.063
What if we ask if she wants
to work with us?

39:39.065 --> 39:41.096
Okay.

39:41.098 --> 39:44.963
No, you sure that's a good idea?
I mean, we just met her.

39:44.965 --> 39:47.330
<i>I mean, all that shit she was
writing me on the computer</i>

39:47.332 --> 39:49.764
about credit card printers
and Bitcoins.

39:49.766 --> 39:51.963
I mean, no offense, but she
knows more than you do,

39:51.965 --> 39:54.096
<i>and if we're going
to keep growing, get bigger,</i>

39:54.098 --> 39:57.196
girl can always help. I mean,
alone, we're just two dudes,

39:57.198 --> 40:01.230
but she can be a girlfriend,
a distraction, a decoy.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.597
<i>Look, listen.
You trust me, right?</i>

40:02.599 --> 40:06.896
Just ask her if she wants
to work with us.

40:08.930 --> 40:10.397
All right. Yeah.

40:10.399 --> 40:12.196
I'll call you back, all right?

40:12.198 --> 40:13.363
Hey, hey, ask her.

40:13.365 --> 40:18.797
- So...
- I was thinking...

40:18.799 --> 40:20.830
All right, you go.

40:20.832 --> 40:27.330
I mean, I was just wondering if you
were working with anybody right now.

40:27.332 --> 40:33.963
That's funny, because I was going to
ask if you wanted to work together.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.530
Ah.

40:35.532 --> 40:37.764
<i>We got pretty
carried away with Kira.</i>

40:37.766 --> 40:39.863
<i>First thing she did was make us
buy a credit card printer.</i>

40:39.865 --> 40:42.896
I have a couple thousand blank
cards I picked up in Thailand.

40:42.898 --> 40:44.730
We can stamp them in here and
sell them on the Darkweb,

40:44.732 --> 40:46.830
or we can use them in stores,

40:46.832 --> 40:50.697
and this is how we can get
credit card information.

40:50.699 --> 40:52.597
<i>We used our old crew
to get the credit card numbers,</i>

40:52.599 --> 40:55.096
<i>and we'd print the duplicates,
hide them in magazines,</i>

40:55.098 --> 40:58.163
<i>and ship them to buyers
all around the world.</i>

41:00.197 --> 41:02.630
<i>Then she got us using Bitcoins.</i>

41:02.632 --> 41:05.730
<i>This was digital currency that
was pretty much untraceable,</i>

41:05.732 --> 41:08.764
<i>and people used it to pay us
for the credit cards.</i>

41:08.766 --> 41:10.929
<i>Then she introduced me
to onion browsing.</i>

41:10.931 --> 41:14.430
<i>Apparently, you could buy an atom bomb
on there, and no one could trace it.</i>

41:14.432 --> 41:18.663
Address. I can type it in
again here.

41:18.665 --> 41:22.497
<i>And then she proved to be
useful in a very practical way.</i>

41:23.331 --> 41:24.996
Like it, sweetie?

41:24.998 --> 41:25.697
Uh-hmm.

41:25.699 --> 41:28.029
We'll take it. Thank you.

41:53.398 --> 41:54.963
<i>Kira basically upgraded us.</i>

41:54.965 --> 41:57.096
<i>She managed to find targets
with much bigger wallets.</i>

41:57.098 --> 41:59.929
<i>That's how we were able to
afford big, expensive toys.</i>

41:59.931 --> 42:03.497
<i>We went from online carding
to real carding.</i>

42:03.499 --> 42:05.963
Why do you keep taking
the pictures?

42:05.965 --> 42:07.363
My clients need to know
what I'm selling.

42:07.365 --> 42:09.863
Having fun? Great.

42:09.865 --> 42:12.029
When do I get to buy something?

42:12.031 --> 42:15.697
Finding right car is like
finding the right woman.

42:15.699 --> 42:19.029
You want to get inside her
several times a day,

42:19.031 --> 42:22.163
show her off to your friends,
but never let them touch her.

42:22.165 --> 42:24.330
- Then you've come to the right place.
- Ah.

42:24.332 --> 42:27.597
It just all depends how much you
want to spend on the wedding.

42:27.599 --> 42:31.397
Oh, depends. What kind of girl?

42:33.131 --> 42:35.196
Italian.

42:35.198 --> 42:37.863
Ah.

42:41.631 --> 42:43.430
You like her, boss?

42:43.432 --> 42:46.130
Never been kissed.

43:05.332 --> 43:09.096
<i>When it came time to sell,
Kira was surprisingly good.</i>

43:09.098 --> 43:11.497
Wow.

43:11.499 --> 43:12.863
I sold the watches.

43:12.865 --> 43:14.363
That's great.

43:14.365 --> 43:16.263
Why didn't you let us know?

43:16.265 --> 43:17.497
Just wanted to take
some initiative.

43:17.499 --> 43:19.630
That's awesome.
That is awesome.

43:19.632 --> 43:22.796
Oh, and I found someone
to buy the diamond ring.

43:22.798 --> 43:28.029
<i>She used a social media site called Mobli
to advertise our products to her buyers.</i>

43:28.031 --> 43:30.096
<i>We were very impressed.</i>

43:30.098 --> 43:32.196
<i>But we suspected she was
working with someone.</i>

43:32.198 --> 43:35.363
<i>Of course sye wasn't very happy
about this new arrangement.</i>

43:35.365 --> 43:37.729
<i>After all, he usually did
all the selling.</i>

43:37.731 --> 43:40.130
Where do you find these guys?

43:40.132 --> 43:43.230
My uncle helped me. I usually
give him a piece of my cut.

43:43.232 --> 43:48.063
Then we're going to have to meet him
if he's going to be working with us.

43:48.065 --> 43:52.696
Well, he really just works with me,
so we don't have to include him.

43:52.698 --> 43:54.063
As long as that's okay
with you guys.

43:54.065 --> 43:57.397
Shouldn't be a problem.
You don't mind, right, sye?

43:57.399 --> 44:01.996
I don't, Alex.
I don't mind at all.

44:17.964 --> 44:19.263
You all right, man?

44:19.265 --> 44:21.130
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

44:21.132 --> 44:24.896
It seems like something's
bugging you.

44:28.630 --> 44:31.430
Look, if you don't want to work
with her, we don't have to.

44:31.432 --> 44:33.296
I don't know.

44:33.298 --> 44:37.696
Just seems like she has all these
buyers that don't even haggle with her.

44:37.698 --> 44:40.929
I mean, how the fuck does
she know these people?

44:40.931 --> 44:44.363
- She fucking 'em?
- Or her uncle's helping her.

44:44.365 --> 44:46.896
Okay. Then why does
she need us, huh?

44:46.898 --> 44:49.696
She seems to be doing
just fine on her own.

44:49.698 --> 44:52.130
My gut's telling me
something's up here.

44:52.132 --> 44:57.063
Maybe your gut's gotten a little jealous
'cause she can do what you can do.

44:59.098 --> 45:00.463
You're joking, right?

45:00.465 --> 45:02.263
I don't know. I mean, it
just seems like

45:02.265 --> 45:05.929
you're a little off
on this one, you know?

45:12.697 --> 45:15.696
Hoo! And they gave me
a ten percent tip.

45:15.698 --> 45:19.196
Why? What,
you give 'em a tug?

45:19.198 --> 45:20.929
Dude, don't be like that.

45:36.830 --> 45:39.562
I think we should move
to Hong Kong.

45:39.564 --> 45:41.596
Why? What's in Hong Kong?

45:41.598 --> 45:46.996
Well, remember I told you there's
a lot of action happening there.

45:46.998 --> 45:49.863
I think you and I could do
really well there if we tried.

45:49.865 --> 45:51.863
Seriously.

45:51.865 --> 45:55.463
Hong Kong is the place to be
for people like us right now.

45:55.465 --> 45:58.230
Sye could keep running
some deals here,

45:58.232 --> 46:01.029
but you and I should go.

46:02.030 --> 46:05.163
If only for a little while.

46:05.165 --> 46:08.263
I can't just get up and go,
especially without sye.

46:08.265 --> 46:09.996
He's like my best friend.

46:09.998 --> 46:12.163
Can't just leave him here.

46:17.331 --> 46:19.629
Well, think about it.

46:28.497 --> 46:31.397
- Hey. -This better be
fucking important.

46:33.030 --> 46:34.829
Roosevelt.

46:34.831 --> 46:36.463
It's nice to...
Nice to finally meet you.

46:36.465 --> 46:38.662
Make it fast, kid.
I don't have all day.

46:38.664 --> 46:40.330
Yeah. You know,
I just wanted to...

46:40.332 --> 46:42.596
I wanted to say
thank you and, uh...

46:42.598 --> 46:45.729
You know, meet you
in person, obviously.

46:45.731 --> 46:48.063
That's what you asked me
out here for?

46:48.065 --> 46:52.929
Well, you know, it's...
I think it's important...

46:53.964 --> 46:56.430
Okay, well, you know,
you brought me in.

46:56.432 --> 47:00.196
You, you know,
here you gave me a shot.

47:00.198 --> 47:02.363
That's my token of gratitude.

47:02.365 --> 47:04.462
How much is it?

47:04.464 --> 47:05.896
It's five grand.

47:05.898 --> 47:09.729
Pretty nice of you.

47:09.731 --> 47:11.462
But I heard that you been...

47:11.464 --> 47:14.397
Can I get a fucking
coffee here?!

47:17.131 --> 47:20.696
I hear you been going
to the stores. Why?

47:22.164 --> 47:24.662
Well, I can make
more money that way.

47:29.164 --> 47:32.130
Oh, that tastes like shit.

47:32.132 --> 47:35.462
And I wanted to find out if you
knew about a girl named Kira.

47:35.464 --> 47:38.763
Yeah, she's a lieutenant.

47:38.765 --> 47:40.662
No, i... no, I never heard of her.
Why? Do you want to fuck her?

47:40.664 --> 47:42.429
No. No, no, no.

47:42.431 --> 47:44.196
I just... I was curious.

47:44.198 --> 47:47.562
Well, if I haven't heard of her,
then she's probably no good.

47:47.564 --> 47:51.397
Anyway, I think we're done here.

47:51.399 --> 47:53.996
Well, no. Do you know
how I can meet zed?

47:57.431 --> 47:59.896
You know zed?

48:00.430 --> 48:02.063
You a cop?

48:02.065 --> 48:03.662
No, of course I'm not a cop.

48:03.664 --> 48:06.629
Don't ask stupid
fucking questions.

48:11.864 --> 48:14.029
This is a fucking stupid idea.

48:14.031 --> 48:15.429
You need to relax, pal.

48:15.431 --> 48:18.963
Who the fuck are you to tell me
to relax? And I'm not your pal.

48:18.965 --> 48:20.829
Jesus. You've been
with us a few weeks,

48:20.831 --> 48:22.763
and you think you can
tell us what to do?

48:22.765 --> 48:24.029
I'm not telling you what to do.

48:24.031 --> 48:26.029
I'm just saying if
we don't do this right,

48:26.031 --> 48:28.230
it's going to take forever
to get rid of all this stuff.

48:28.232 --> 48:29.596
I think it's pretty logical.

48:29.598 --> 48:32.562
No, no, no, no, no.
What's logical is to stay small,

48:32.564 --> 48:34.096
keep pushing smaller loads,

48:34.098 --> 48:37.562
and then when it's time, grow
bigger and push larger ones.

48:37.564 --> 48:41.096
That's exactly what we're doing.
We're growing, so keep up.

48:41.098 --> 48:43.763
Alex, you better step in, or I
am gonna tip this truck over,

48:43.765 --> 48:48.396
and she's gonna kill herself when she hits the
ground and I fall on her face with my ass!

48:53.897 --> 48:55.829
You know, you need
to calm down, okay?

48:55.831 --> 48:57.296
Oh, are you fucking
serious right now?

48:57.298 --> 48:58.696
You're making everybody tense.

48:58.698 --> 49:00.496
You're fucking supposed
to be tense.

49:00.498 --> 49:04.896
Look, it's a dumb idea
walking into this meeting.

49:04.898 --> 49:06.196
How do you know?

49:06.198 --> 49:07.330
'Cause they're buying
a shitload,

49:07.332 --> 49:08.763
and unlike miss fancy-pants,

49:08.765 --> 49:10.429
we don't know
who the fuck they are.

49:10.431 --> 49:12.629
Why does that matter,
though? They're buying.

49:12.631 --> 49:14.096
It matters because...

49:14.098 --> 49:18.696
Ah, god. Jesus, Alex.
You're not thinking. All right?

49:18.698 --> 49:20.796
Look, we got a good thing
going here, man.

49:20.798 --> 49:22.196
I don't want to screw it up.

49:22.198 --> 49:23.929
All right, I been watching her.

49:23.931 --> 49:25.729
Something's not right.
I can't put my finger on it.

49:25.731 --> 49:27.863
It's on me, okay,
'cause I brought her in,

49:27.865 --> 49:32.696
but I'm telling you that fucking girl
is putting us under too much risk.

49:32.698 --> 49:35.096
We'll go in. We'll
evaluate the situation.

49:35.098 --> 49:39.863
If we can't, it won't matter because we
can just sell them all individually.

49:39.865 --> 49:41.996
Huh?

49:41.998 --> 49:44.963
- It's not...
- Alex!

49:53.597 --> 49:57.496
Everything looks good.
We'd be happy to make a deal.

49:57.498 --> 49:59.433
Well, of course I
share your opinion.

49:59.458 --> 50:01.929
It looks good, and I would
love to make a deal.

50:01.931 --> 50:07.763
But I'd like to know,
what's your real commitment?

50:07.765 --> 50:11.230
Honestly, how many of these things
do you want to buy today, hmm?

50:11.232 --> 50:13.462
A few? Half? How many?

50:13.464 --> 50:16.996
'Cause our principle of business
is based on trust,

50:16.998 --> 50:19.662
because without trust,
you can't have business.

50:19.664 --> 50:21.929
And, of course,
I want to become trustworthy,

50:21.931 --> 50:24.929
so I don't want you to feel like
you got to buy everything today.

50:24.931 --> 50:28.596
You know, you're welcome to just take a
few pieces and then come back for more.

50:28.598 --> 50:32.362
Actually, no.
My partner's mistaken.

50:32.364 --> 50:34.262
There is no negotiating here.

50:34.264 --> 50:36.829
Either you buy everything
in that truck,

50:36.831 --> 50:39.396
or we walk and find
another buyer.

50:39.398 --> 50:40.662
That's our deal.

50:40.664 --> 50:42.662
- Take it, or leave it.
- What the fuck are you doing?

50:42.664 --> 50:45.996
I'm selling, because clearly you're
not man enough to do it yourself.

50:45.998 --> 50:48.796
This is the biggest deal we've ever had.
I'm not gonna let you ruin this.

50:48.798 --> 50:52.130
Why don't you just back off and
let the adults deal with this?

50:52.132 --> 50:55.796
Because you're about to ruin this deal
with that fat little mouth of yours.

50:55.798 --> 50:57.529
What makes you feel like
you can talk to me like that?

50:57.531 --> 51:00.696
I'm protecting my interests. My money paid
for the stuff just as much as yours did.

51:00.698 --> 51:02.396
Where do you find these guys?

51:02.398 --> 51:05.863
Not a single one of them seems to know
who you are, so where'd you find 'em?

51:05.865 --> 51:07.130
Sye, it's her uncle, all right?
It's fine.

51:07.132 --> 51:09.396
- Just let her handle it.
- Oh, god, this fucking uncle.

51:09.398 --> 51:11.295
What are you, taking her side?
No, hey, hey, hey.

51:11.297 --> 51:14.863
She brings in these sketchy-ass buyers
who, as far as we know, might be cops.

51:14.865 --> 51:17.696
- The buyers are not cops.
- How the fuck do you know, huh?!

51:17.698 --> 51:19.763
God, you're always so
fucking sure of yourself.

51:19.765 --> 51:21.562
You need to calm the fuck down.

51:21.564 --> 51:23.629
All you ever do is talk!

51:23.631 --> 51:25.529
Yeah, I'll talk all I want to,
sweetheart,

51:25.531 --> 51:27.996
'cause I been doing this
a lot longer than you have.

51:27.998 --> 51:29.362
Okay, why don't we
just make a deal, guys?

51:29.364 --> 51:31.963
No, there's not gonna be a deal
with this fucking girl here!

51:31.965 --> 51:34.729
- Is there a problem here?
- No. There's no problem...

51:34.731 --> 51:37.429
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

51:37.431 --> 51:39.396
Okay, look, we don't want
any trouble, okay?

51:39.398 --> 51:40.763
So let's just make the deal.

51:40.765 --> 51:42.130
No deal.

51:42.132 --> 51:44.163
Okay, that's fine.

51:44.165 --> 51:45.096
All right.
All right. We'll go.

51:45.098 --> 51:47.229
Stop being pussies.

51:47.231 --> 51:48.963
We are making this deal
right now.

51:48.965 --> 51:51.130
You are gonna buy
everything in that truck...

51:54.363 --> 51:58.562
All right, sye, Kira, I need you to
just shut the fuck up right now, okay?

51:58.564 --> 52:01.362
It's fine. No deal.
You walk. We'll walk.

52:01.364 --> 52:03.496
We can make a deal another time,
okay?

52:03.498 --> 52:05.329
Deal is off the table
for good now.

52:05.331 --> 52:10.462
If we ever see you again, if you
deal with anyone that we know,

52:10.464 --> 52:12.462
we will not be as pleasant
as we were today.

52:12.464 --> 52:14.929
Let's go.

52:22.897 --> 52:24.130
That was pleasant?

52:26.430 --> 52:28.863
- Good job, sye.
- Fuck off!

52:28.865 --> 52:31.829
You have to be
so up in his face?

52:31.831 --> 52:35.130
These are my contacts.
You guys are ruining all of my contacts.

52:35.131 --> 52:37.662
What a waste of my time.

52:42.230 --> 52:43.896
Fuck!

52:55.997 --> 52:58.029
That was a fucking mess.

52:59.296 --> 53:00.696
You guys either need
to get along,

53:00.698 --> 53:02.295
or we all go our separate ways,

53:02.297 --> 53:03.396
'cause I don't want to get shot,

53:03.398 --> 53:05.496
and I'm pretty sure
you guys don't either.

53:05.498 --> 53:09.063
So, sye, you got to relax.

53:09.065 --> 53:10.929
I mean, if she thinks
she can handle something,

53:10.931 --> 53:13.262
you got to give her
a chance, man.

53:13.264 --> 53:15.662
Sorry.

53:15.664 --> 53:17.496
Yeah, whatever.

53:17.498 --> 53:19.462
Sye.

53:20.230 --> 53:23.496
Fine. I'm sorry.

53:32.330 --> 53:34.796
There's cops at our truck.

53:45.497 --> 53:47.596
We got to get out of here.

54:08.296 --> 54:10.796
That was really close.

54:12.296 --> 54:13.963
Why'd he just leave like that?

54:13.965 --> 54:15.896
Who cares? He's gone.

54:15.898 --> 54:18.596
Okay, guys, I been thinking
about what happened today,

54:18.598 --> 54:21.996
and I think it's a sign
for us to move somewhere else.

54:23.463 --> 54:25.596
He's right.

54:25.598 --> 54:27.429
Those buyers could
actually come after us.

54:27.431 --> 54:29.095
They're all mobbed up.

54:29.097 --> 54:30.896
All mobbed up?

54:30.898 --> 54:32.863
You hooked us up
with mobbed-up buyers?

54:32.865 --> 54:38.562
That doesn't matter anymore, because
we're going to get out of the city.

54:42.597 --> 54:46.796
Okay, then where are we
going to go?

54:48.597 --> 54:50.929
How 'bout Hong Kong?

55:30.730 --> 55:33.329
<i>So Hong Kong
became our new home.</i>

55:33.331 --> 55:35.329
<i>We'd made a ton of money,</i>

55:35.331 --> 55:37.129
<i>so we decided to enjoy it
a little bit.</i>

55:55.029 --> 55:56.562
This is nice.

55:56.564 --> 55:57.629
Yeah, it's beautiful.

55:57.631 --> 56:00.129
Eh, it's all right.

56:00.131 --> 56:01.596
Seriously?

56:01.598 --> 56:03.928
What? It's a fucking
hotel room.

56:04.663 --> 56:07.863
Going to go find the minibar.

56:07.865 --> 56:10.396
<i>We also got ourselves
a brand-new car</i>

56:10.398 --> 56:11.696
<i>and a quiet place
where we could work.</i>

56:11.698 --> 56:16.995
<i>Here we kept all of our gear
and our money.</i>

56:36.463 --> 56:38.162
<i>And after everything
that happened,</i>

56:38.164 --> 56:41.662
<i>we hoped that things would calm
down and we'd move up in the world.</i>

56:41.664 --> 56:44.429
<i>At least,
I had hoped they would.</i>

56:44.431 --> 56:46.229
Thank you.

56:46.231 --> 56:48.763
<i>Me Gusta.</i>

56:57.363 --> 56:59.362
<i>Here, our volumes got bigger.</i>

56:59.364 --> 57:00.696
<i>We bought more,</i>

57:00.698 --> 57:03.162
<i>we sold more,
and for higher prices.</i>

57:03.164 --> 57:06.962
<i>But it was all the same shit,
watches, jewelry, computers, phones.</i>

57:06.964 --> 57:09.962
<i>It didn't feel like we were
doing anything special.</i>

57:18.363 --> 57:20.195
I like them.

57:20.197 --> 57:22.729
We'll take it.

57:22.731 --> 57:23.696
All of them.

57:23.698 --> 57:25.396
Great. Thank you.

57:34.063 --> 57:38.362
I want you to appreciate the quality of
the product that I'm bringing to you.

57:38.364 --> 57:41.928
How much, all?

57:43.096 --> 57:44.629
Two hundred.

57:45.896 --> 57:47.529
For you.

58:03.930 --> 58:06.462
<i>It felt like we were
just making money.</i>

58:06.464 --> 58:08.195
<i>We had no purpose.
We weren't moving forward.</i>

58:08.197 --> 58:09.828
Please have her sign here.

58:09.830 --> 58:13.295
<i>We even started getting sloppy.</i>

58:13.297 --> 58:14.662
<i>Anytime we used the card,</i>

58:14.664 --> 58:16.696
<i>we always did
a test purchase online</i>

58:16.698 --> 58:18.763
<i>to make sure the card
wasn't blocked,</i>

58:18.765 --> 58:20.429
<i>but we had hundreds
of credit cards,</i>

58:20.431 --> 58:22.429
<i>and it was hard
to keep track of them,</i>

58:22.431 --> 58:24.729
<i>so we got ourselves a pick-up.</i>

58:25.996 --> 58:28.195
I'm... sorry, sir.

58:30.598 --> 58:32.629
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

58:37.663 --> 58:39.662
<i>A pick-up was when
a card would get canceled,</i>

58:39.664 --> 58:41.995
<i>and if a duplicate was used,
the terminal would recognize</i>

58:41.997 --> 58:43.928
<i>that it's a fake
and would warn the cashier</i>

58:43.930 --> 58:46.662
<i>to hold the card
and call the cops.</i>

58:46.664 --> 58:50.429
<i>We took that risk whenever
we didn't test the card.</i>

58:53.029 --> 58:58.295
<i>Like I said, we were just
making money, a lot of it,</i>

58:58.297 --> 59:01.596
<i>and the trouble with that is
money doesn't change people.</i>

59:01.598 --> 59:03.696
<i>It reveals them.</i>

59:03.698 --> 59:08.729
<i>And I got to see a side of sye
that I'd never seen before.</i>

59:08.731 --> 59:11.762
Jeez, would you quit
with the computer already?

59:11.764 --> 59:14.629
We still get buyers off Mobli.

59:22.397 --> 59:24.329
I feel like we're not
getting anywhere.

59:24.331 --> 59:27.529
We're doing the exact same shit
we were doing in Toronto.

59:27.531 --> 59:29.728
It's getting kind of boring,
don't you think?

59:29.730 --> 59:32.696
It's not like we're sending anyone
a message or hurting the system.

59:32.698 --> 59:34.562
We're just making money.

59:34.564 --> 59:36.828
So what do you want to do?

59:36.830 --> 59:39.762
I don't know. We just got to...
We got to step our game up.

59:39.764 --> 59:42.028
We got to do something that's
big, something that'll hurt.

59:42.030 --> 59:44.895
Well, zed prides himself
on being a visionary.

59:44.897 --> 59:47.262
He knows that to send
a message to the system,

59:47.264 --> 59:52.229
you have to talk in terms of dollars
and cents, because money is power.

59:52.231 --> 59:56.429
If we can figure out a way
to make money and cause chaos,

59:56.431 --> 59:58.262
we can finally get
his attention.

59:58.264 --> 01:00:00.928
Okay, so how do we do it?

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.496
- What if we try...

01:00:03.498 --> 01:00:06.662
Guys, we should be celebrating!

01:00:06.664 --> 01:00:10.129
Celebrating what, failure?

01:00:10.963 --> 01:00:12.728
It's my birthday.

01:00:14.996 --> 01:00:15.995
Ah.

01:00:40.096 --> 01:00:41.728
So what do you think?

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:45.562
I can't believe we forgot
his birthday.

01:00:45.564 --> 01:00:48.195
We gotta get him something.

01:00:48.197 --> 01:00:51.928
No, Alex,
I was talking about the ATM's.

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:55.162
That's my girl, not yours.

01:00:55.164 --> 01:00:57.362
She doesn't want to be with you.

01:00:57.364 --> 01:00:59.995
I paid for her the whole night.

01:00:59.997 --> 01:01:03.262
I paid her three times as much,
so fuck off!

01:01:03.264 --> 01:01:05.095
You can't afford her anymore.

01:01:05.097 --> 01:01:06.895
Oh, shit.

01:01:07.996 --> 01:01:10.028
Excuse me. One side.

01:01:12.996 --> 01:01:15.928
Sye!

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:27.728
Calm down, buddy!
Calm down! Calm down!

01:01:38.397 --> 01:01:39.628
Shut the fuck up!

01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:54.828
I'm sorry, man.

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:00.728
Hey.

01:02:02.296 --> 01:02:04.962
Look, I know.
I fucked up.

01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:08.862
Okay.

01:02:10.096 --> 01:02:12.062
I get it.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.062
Andrew Smith.

01:02:16.064 --> 01:02:17.862
Eric Dupere.

01:02:17.864 --> 01:02:20.462
Come out.

01:02:35.796 --> 01:02:37.795
What happened?
What's going on?

01:02:37.797 --> 01:02:40.062
My uncle.

01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:06.262
Where's sye?

01:03:06.264 --> 01:03:08.828
I don't know. He was
gone when I woke up.

01:03:10.562 --> 01:03:14.396
Listen, I think I have what
we've been looking for.

01:03:14.398 --> 01:03:16.195
Yeah, what's that?

01:03:16.197 --> 01:03:18.728
- ATM's.
- What do you mean, "ATM's"?

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:21.728
So, banks keep physical cash
in vaults,

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:24.528
safety-deposit boxes,
and ATM's.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:26.995
- Okay. -Wire fraud gets
covered by insurance,

01:03:26.997 --> 01:03:32.129
but if we knock a physical location, then
it's a question of security and reputation,

01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:37.229
that's amazing. Why have we been wasting
our time with all the other shit?

01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:44.795
Check it. Check it.
Check it.

01:03:47.896 --> 01:03:49.528
You like?

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:51.129
How did you get that?

01:03:51.131 --> 01:03:53.828
I did what I'm good at. I bought
some things. I sold some things.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.928
Don't say I don't got it
anymore. I still got it.

01:03:55.930 --> 01:04:00.828
And it's also an apology
for yesterday.

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:06.129
- That's a nice job, man.
- Yeah, way to go.

01:04:06.131 --> 01:04:11.429
Oh, and for old times' sake,
look what card I used.

01:04:13.462 --> 01:04:18.195
- You fucking serious, sye?
- What?

01:04:18.197 --> 01:04:21.928
You went out, used this fucking
card? Are you out of your mind?

01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:23.795
What's your problem?

01:04:23.797 --> 01:04:25.728
Well, for one, where's your
fucking disguise, sye?

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.129
Don't worry about it.
It's not a big deal.

01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:29.862
- I wore my sunglasses.
- Sunglasses. That's great.

01:04:29.864 --> 01:04:33.661
The problem is that we took
money from this card, sye!

01:04:33.663 --> 01:04:36.129
You can't just go out and use it
without a fucking disguise!

01:04:36.131 --> 01:04:37.795
Do you not know
they can find us?!

01:04:37.797 --> 01:04:40.628
Jesus, I was just
trying to help.

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:42.995
Just like you helped yesterday,
got us thrown in jail, huh?

01:04:42.997 --> 01:04:45.195
I already told you I was sorry.
What more do you want from me?

01:04:45.197 --> 01:04:48.528
Nothing. I don't want anything
from you anymore. You know why?

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:50.395
'Cause you been acting
like a dick lately.

01:04:50.397 --> 01:04:51.728
You've been fucking
everything up.

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.561
You don't trust Kira.
You're drunk all the time.

01:04:53.563 --> 01:04:54.795
And now you've gone
and used the fucking card

01:04:54.797 --> 01:04:58.229
that I specifically told you
not to use again, sye!

01:04:58.231 --> 01:05:01.262
I think you should just go.

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.329
Just go back to Toronto, huh?

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:06.628
Is this coming from her?
Did she tell you to say this?

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:08.428
She didn't say shit.
This is me, sye.

01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:09.895
This is me asking you to leave.

01:05:09.897 --> 01:05:11.728
'Cause while you're here, we're
gonna get fucking locked up

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:13.995
or we're gonna fucking die!

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:17.895
So you should just...
Just take your cut and go, huh.

01:05:23.396 --> 01:05:24.695
Okay.

01:05:26.063 --> 01:05:27.895
I'll pack my bags.

01:05:58.696 --> 01:06:00.962
I left my ids in the drawer.
Good luck with everything.

01:06:03.296 --> 01:06:06.762
You know, this used to be fun.

01:06:21.396 --> 01:06:24.528
Oh, fuck.

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:28.928
What the fuck did I just do?
What the fuck did I just do?

01:06:30.263 --> 01:06:31.995
Oh, shit.

01:07:25.063 --> 01:07:27.695
234 Tak man street.

01:07:39.996 --> 01:07:44.528
<i>Now let's try the ATM...
18 Kierna Waiden road.</i>

01:07:45.996 --> 01:07:51.595
5052 ma hang road. It's busy,
but you can take a lot.

01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:14.695
That's the last one.

01:08:14.697 --> 01:08:16.595
I'm out.

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:24.661
<i>$2.3 million was stolen across
various ATM's in Hong Kong.</i>

01:08:24.662 --> 01:08:27.895
<i>Authorities are at a loss, as
no one knows how this happened,</i>

01:08:27.897 --> 01:08:32.461
<i>but we do have confirmation that a
notorious cybercriminal organization</i>

01:08:32.462 --> 01:08:34.294
<i>has claimed responsibility.</i>

01:08:34.296 --> 01:08:35.928
<i>Darkweb, the online mafia</i>

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.962
<i>controlled by international
fugitive zed,</i>

01:08:38.964 --> 01:08:42.995
<i>left their business cards
at the scene of the crime.</i>

01:08:42.997 --> 01:08:45.928
<i>Was committed by Darkweb,
and we won't stop</i>

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:48.261
<i>until we find the people
responsible for the citizens...</i>

01:08:48.263 --> 01:08:49.661
To causing a little chaos.

01:08:49.662 --> 01:08:52.328
<i>World banks now fear for
the safety of their assets.</i>

01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:58.395
So we should probably pack up
and get out of here tomorrow.

01:08:58.397 --> 01:09:00.862
Whole city'll be looking for us.

01:09:00.863 --> 01:09:01.962
Yeah.

01:09:01.964 --> 01:09:04.962
Everything okay?

01:09:04.964 --> 01:09:07.161
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:09:07.162 --> 01:09:10.728
Hey, come on. Look at me.
What's on your mind?

01:09:13.496 --> 01:09:15.595
I want to get out.

01:09:15.596 --> 01:09:18.461
That's what we're doing.
We're leaving.

01:09:18.462 --> 01:09:23.428
No, I mean I don't want
to do this anymore.

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:25.428
I want to disappear.

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:27.161
Disappear? Where?

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.528
Anywhere. Let's just go.

01:09:29.529 --> 01:09:30.962
With this money,
if we invest it,

01:09:30.964 --> 01:09:33.895
we don't have to worry about
anything ever again.

01:09:33.897 --> 01:09:36.294
Are you fucking serious
right now?

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:39.095
Don't swear at me.

01:09:39.996 --> 01:09:42.294
Okay, look, I'm sorry,

01:09:42.296 --> 01:09:44.627
but that's fucking stupid,
all right?

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:47.228
You just want... you want to
leave all this behind

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:48.694
and go live a boring
old life, huh?

01:09:48.697 --> 01:09:51.294
Would it really be that boring
if it was just the two of us?

01:09:51.296 --> 01:09:52.560
Yes. What the fuck
would we do?

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:54.495
We would relax, enjoy life.

01:09:54.497 --> 01:09:55.661
But for how long?
Are you Cr...

01:09:55.663 --> 01:09:56.928
I mean, you're the one who said

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:58.695
we got to cause chaos
and make some money.

01:09:58.697 --> 01:10:02.895
Yeah, well, now that we've done that, I
think maybe we should relax for a minute.

01:10:02.897 --> 01:10:05.261
Fuck that. Why do you want
to leave? What's changed?

01:10:05.263 --> 01:10:12.261
I had a different plan for my life,
and now it's just different.

01:10:12.263 --> 01:10:14.094
Okay, well, you know,
I appreciate that,

01:10:14.096 --> 01:10:16.928
but i...
I can't just drop this.

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:21.495
I mean, my parents almost lost everything
'cause of those fucking banks.

01:10:21.497 --> 01:10:22.728
I'm going to punish all of them.

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:25.261
Those fuckers don't deserve
to sit in their chairs

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:28.461
and rip people off every...

01:10:44.997 --> 01:10:48.094
Oh, my god. It's zed.

01:11:28.195 --> 01:11:30.161
It's done.

01:11:30.163 --> 01:11:33.161
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

01:11:33.163 --> 01:11:36.862
Okay. I don't...
I don't fucking understand you.

01:11:36.864 --> 01:11:40.027
You're the one who said we
needed to get zed's attention.

01:11:49.629 --> 01:11:51.862
Yeah, I'm in Hong Kong.

01:11:53.129 --> 01:11:55.128
Yeah, there's two of us.

01:11:56.329 --> 01:11:57.728
Yeah.

01:12:01.329 --> 01:12:02.928
<i>Kira's plan had worked.</i>

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:05.395
<i>Zed noticed us
and arranged a meeting</i>

01:12:05.397 --> 01:12:06.994
<i>off the island of Hong Kong.</i>

01:12:06.996 --> 01:12:10.461
<i>But the man behind the Darkweb
mask was very different</i>

01:12:10.463 --> 01:12:12.795
<i>to what I'd imagined in my head.</i>

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:16.595
Get out of the car.
Leave your stuff.

01:12:16.597 --> 01:12:18.862
He's going to search you.

01:12:55.429 --> 01:12:58.927
So what brings you to Hong Kong?

01:12:58.929 --> 01:13:01.228
Well, we...

01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:03.862
We almost got caught in Toronto.

01:13:03.864 --> 01:13:06.762
We got tired of that, so Kira
suggested we move here.

01:13:10.662 --> 01:13:13.695
Why would you suggest that?

01:13:16.028 --> 01:13:19.661
Because Hong Kong is the place
to be for people like us.

01:13:20.928 --> 01:13:23.294
Also we heard that maybe
you'd be out here, too.

01:13:23.296 --> 01:13:25.428
We wanted to meet you.

01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:30.061
You wanted to meet me?

01:13:30.063 --> 01:13:33.561
What made you think that you
would even get my attention?

01:13:33.563 --> 01:13:36.261
We had a plan that could
bring in a lot of money.

01:13:36.263 --> 01:13:39.762
Oh. Well, I don't care
about money,

01:13:39.764 --> 01:13:43.294
but I understand
that many people do.

01:13:43.296 --> 01:13:46.595
So, why do you need me?

01:13:46.597 --> 01:13:49.261
Oh, we need a lot of resources.

01:13:49.263 --> 01:13:51.695
The plan wouldn't work
without you.

01:13:51.697 --> 01:13:53.795
Okay.

01:13:53.797 --> 01:13:59.894
Then after you tell me,
why do I need you?

01:13:59.896 --> 01:14:02.628
'Cause we know how
to get this job done.

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:05.661
I would have people
to do that for me,

01:14:05.663 --> 01:14:08.828
hmm, more than likely
even better.

01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:12.595
Well, sir, I believe you
to be a man of principle,

01:14:12.597 --> 01:14:15.261
so if I bring you an idea
and you like it,

01:14:15.263 --> 01:14:18.661
I can only hope that you'll let
me see it through to the end.

01:14:21.562 --> 01:14:25.795
Well, before you tell me what
you're about to tell me...

01:14:25.797 --> 01:14:30.228
I need you to understand
who I am.

01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:33.094
I am not your friend.

01:14:33.096 --> 01:14:35.927
I'm not your boss.

01:14:35.929 --> 01:14:38.561
I am your owner.

01:14:38.563 --> 01:14:42.294
If you work for me,
you'll become my property,

01:14:42.296 --> 01:14:45.461
and if you do your job right,

01:14:45.463 --> 01:14:48.595
you could have
anything you want.

01:14:49.562 --> 01:14:52.961
But if you make a mistake,

01:14:52.963 --> 01:14:55.561
you will die.

01:14:56.928 --> 01:15:02.961
And so will your families and
so will all your friends.

01:15:04.295 --> 01:15:05.927
So, if you want to hold the ax,

01:15:05.929 --> 01:15:11.595
you make sure to cut off
the head clean.

01:15:12.496 --> 01:15:15.061
Because with me,

01:15:15.063 --> 01:15:18.561
there won't be any mistakes.

01:15:26.529 --> 01:15:28.595
So why didn't you say
anything in there, huh?

01:15:28.597 --> 01:15:31.428
There's no limit
to what he can do.

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:34.395
What the hell?

01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:39.261
Got a missed call from sye.

01:15:39.263 --> 01:15:40.761
<i>Hey, Alex, it's me.</i>

01:15:40.763 --> 01:15:42.961
<i>I'm just...
I'm really sorry about the...</i>

01:15:42.963 --> 01:15:44.927
<i>The way that things went down,
and I just...</i>

01:15:44.929 --> 01:15:47.261
<i>I been thinking a lot,
and I just really want a chance</i>

01:15:47.263 --> 01:15:48.927
<i>to make it up to you and Kira,</i>

01:15:48.929 --> 01:15:51.761
<i>just go back to the way
that things were.</i>

01:15:51.763 --> 01:15:54.261
So, I came back to the hotel,
and I'm here right now,

01:15:54.263 --> 01:15:58.361
and I'm just going to wait for
you till you get back, so...

01:15:59.829 --> 01:16:02.861
Oh, maybe that's you right now.

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:09.761
What... just wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

01:16:12.162 --> 01:16:13.794
He's at the hotel.

01:16:13.796 --> 01:16:15.161
Really?

01:16:15.163 --> 01:16:16.861
Yeah.

01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:20.561
Sounds like he's feeling better.
Maybe we should go talk to him.

01:16:20.563 --> 01:16:22.661
Maybe we should.

01:16:36.895 --> 01:16:39.094
Sye?

01:16:41.295 --> 01:16:43.395
Sye.

01:16:52.429 --> 01:16:55.727
Sye! S...

01:16:58.129 --> 01:16:59.395
Fuck!

01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:02.528
Fuck!

01:17:05.263 --> 01:17:08.894
<i>I'm gonna call
the cops. I'll call the cops.</i>

01:17:08.896 --> 01:17:10.894
<i>Alex, you cannot call the cops.</i>

01:17:10.896 --> 01:17:12.660
- I'll call the ambulance. They
can do something! -Alex...

01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:14.994
- No, they can't, Alex.
- They'll come and help him!

01:17:14.996 --> 01:17:16.727
- There's no helping him!
- We can't leave him, Kira!

01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:18.495
- There's no helping him right now, Alex.
- Fuck you!

01:17:18.497 --> 01:17:20.595
- I'm gonna call the ambulance!
- Give me the phone!

01:17:20.597 --> 01:17:22.428
- Fuck you!
- Give me the phone.

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:24.827
<i>Ow! Stop!</i>

01:17:24.829 --> 01:17:28.361
<i>Stop! Get out...
We have to get out of here!</i>

01:17:28.363 --> 01:17:31.027
<i>Stop! Please!</i>

01:17:32.728 --> 01:17:36.094
<i>The Colombian man who left his credit
card at the strip club in Toronto</i>

01:17:36.096 --> 01:17:42.161
<i>he missed the first transaction, but
he was ready for the second one.</i>

01:17:43.496 --> 01:17:46.660
<i>If sye hadn't come back...</i>

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:49.595
<i>Kira and I would have been dead.</i>

01:18:04.828 --> 01:18:07.528
<i>There's a team waiting for you.</i>

01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:11.128
<i>They'll do whatever
you ask them to.</i>

01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:15.761
<i>I heard about what
happened to your friend,</i>

01:18:15.763 --> 01:18:18.660
<i>and I understand
this must be hard for you,</i>

01:18:18.662 --> 01:18:20.761
<i>but I want you to say
to yourself,</i>

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:26.361
"I will still get
this fucking job done."

01:18:26.363 --> 01:18:30.061
I'm still going to get
this fucking job done.

01:18:30.962 --> 01:18:32.694
Listen, I think
after all this is done,

01:18:32.696 --> 01:18:34.294
we should find
a place to hide out.

01:18:34.296 --> 01:18:36.627
Yeah, I agree.
We should go back to Toronto.

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:40.861
No. We need to go
as far away as possible.

01:18:40.863 --> 01:18:43.827
I have an idea as to where
we should meet.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:57.161
<i>You know, ever since the banks started
to suffer these cyber-attacks,</i>

01:18:57.163 --> 01:18:59.294
<i>the market has been shaky.</i>

01:18:59.296 --> 01:19:03.660
<i>Fortunately, the federal reserve chairman
started to put more money into the economy,</i>

01:19:03.662 --> 01:19:06.094
<i>and things have started
to stabilize.</i>

01:19:06.096 --> 01:19:08.761
<i>Better housing, less taxes,</i>

01:19:08.763 --> 01:19:11.094
<i>more money for you,
more money for me,</i>

01:19:11.096 --> 01:19:12.461
<i>more money for all of us.</i>

01:19:15.429 --> 01:19:17.061
Where were you?

01:19:17.063 --> 01:19:18.560
Just using my phone.

01:19:19.762 --> 01:19:22.027
We're 15 away.

01:19:22.029 --> 01:19:26.061
<i>- Are you sure, sir? -Yes,
I'm sure, Mr. Dimayo.</i>

01:19:26.063 --> 01:19:29.361
<i>Sir, each of these stock options
might not cost a lot right now,</i>

01:19:29.363 --> 01:19:33.495
<i>but they're going to expire in half
an hour, and they will be worthless.</i>

01:19:33.497 --> 01:19:35.328
<i>You see, by opening up
these positions,</i>

01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:38.994
<i>you're betting that the market
is essentially going to crash.</i>

01:19:38.996 --> 01:19:41.660
<i>I just want you to understand
that, you know, my job...</i>

01:19:41.662 --> 01:19:44.727
Your job is to do
exactly as I tell you,

01:19:44.729 --> 01:19:48.927
and if I tell you to open,
you will fucking open.

01:19:48.929 --> 01:19:52.627
<i>They'll be up on your screen
once we fill the orders.</i>

01:20:02.028 --> 01:20:04.461
- I can't do this.
- No, no, no, no.

01:20:04.463 --> 01:20:07.827
Look, look.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:20:07.829 --> 01:20:12.560
What are these kids doing?
Get back to your seats.

01:20:12.562 --> 01:20:14.094
I think we should walk away.

01:20:14.096 --> 01:20:15.627
What are you talking about?

01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:18.660
Things are not right here.
It's going to go badly.

01:20:20.795 --> 01:20:22.194
Guys.

01:20:22.196 --> 01:20:24.194
It's not going to go well.

01:20:24.196 --> 01:20:26.228
They're almost there, guys.

01:20:26.230 --> 01:20:27.494
I need you here, okay?

01:20:27.496 --> 01:20:29.428
No, Alex, you don't
need me here.

01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:30.428
You can do this yourself.

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:32.961
Okay, fine, fine.
I want you here.

01:20:32.963 --> 01:20:34.328
They're pulling up
to the building.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:38.294
All right, look, I don't want
to do this without you.

01:20:38.296 --> 01:20:40.194
Okay, after this, we can go.

01:20:40.196 --> 01:20:43.228
We can do whatever you want to do, but
now I really would like you here.

01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:44.560
It's not that simple.

01:20:44.562 --> 01:20:46.094
Kira, please, come on.

01:20:47.762 --> 01:20:50.395
Guys, we really need you
here right now.

01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:05.061
Guys, here we go.

01:21:20.928 --> 01:21:24.027
Sir, sir, can you comment
on the current market situation?

01:21:24.029 --> 01:21:26.761
Can we be expecting any
market corrections, perhaps?

01:21:26.763 --> 01:21:27.761
No comment.

01:21:27.763 --> 01:21:31.961
- For bringing the market
back onto its feet...

01:21:34.330 --> 01:21:36.261
Fuck, yeah!

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:44.161
Are they ready?

01:21:44.163 --> 01:21:46.460
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Begin.

01:22:03.628 --> 01:22:05.394
<i>We're just getting
a breaking news alert.</i>

01:22:05.396 --> 01:22:07.128
<i>We have some live breaking news.</i>

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:08.360
<i>We have a shot for you.</i>

01:22:08.362 --> 01:22:12.128
<i>There's been an incident with the
chairman of the federal reserve.</i>

01:22:12.130 --> 01:22:16.061
<i>Tragic situation, and of course
this is affecting the state</i>

01:22:16.063 --> 01:22:19.394
<i>and the entire country
as we wait with bated breath.</i>

01:22:19.396 --> 01:22:21.594
<i>No confirmation on
if he has been killed.</i>

01:22:21.596 --> 01:22:23.761
<i>He was rushed to hospital.</i>

01:22:23.763 --> 01:22:27.527
The chairman of the federal
reserve has just been shot

01:22:27.529 --> 01:22:28.927
outside the federal reserve
building.

01:22:28.929 --> 01:22:31.660
We have no idea where...

01:22:44.995 --> 01:22:50.261
<i>We have a report that the chairman of
the federal reserve has been shot.</i>

01:22:50.263 --> 01:22:54.294
<i>It is unconfirmed whether
or not he has been killed.</i>

01:22:54.296 --> 01:22:56.961
Is this thing
actually happening?

01:22:56.963 --> 01:22:58.560
Good god.

01:22:58.562 --> 01:23:00.560
Well, of course, yes.
Unload everything.

01:23:00.562 --> 01:23:03.527
Yes, everything!
Just do it!

01:23:05.828 --> 01:23:07.061
Bloody yanks.

01:23:32.428 --> 01:23:33.827
<i>Sir, from the looks of it,</i>

01:23:33.829 --> 01:23:35.994
<i>there will probably be
an investigation.</i>

01:23:35.996 --> 01:23:37.727
Pull the positions.

01:23:37.729 --> 01:23:40.761
Send the rest of the money
to these accounts.

01:23:40.763 --> 01:23:44.627
Twenty percent to Alex, and the
rest you can divide up equally.

01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:47.161
<i>Sir, maybe we should wait until
Monday so that the sec...</i>

01:23:47.163 --> 01:23:52.660
Just do it. Remember, oz,
money doesn't change anybody.

01:23:52.662 --> 01:23:54.894
It only reveals them.

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:58.627
Let's see what our friend
does with his money.

01:24:06.195 --> 01:24:10.260
- Need to get out of here.
- Yeah. Just one more second.

01:24:10.262 --> 01:24:13.961
That's for sye, asshole.

01:24:15.495 --> 01:24:19.594
Is what? Hold on. Sir!

01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:21.827
News says you've been killed.

01:24:22.928 --> 01:24:24.161
Hello.

01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:27.961
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:24:27.963 --> 01:24:30.594
How can I be dead
if I'm talking to you?

01:24:30.596 --> 01:24:33.027
<i>And that's the closing bell.</i>

01:24:33.029 --> 01:24:37.161
<i>After today's tragic incident,
the market witnessed a nosedive,</i>

01:24:37.163 --> 01:24:40.527
<i>and by the looks of it,
the sec has ordered a stop</i>

01:24:40.529 --> 01:24:43.527
<i>on all trading accounts
until further notice.</i>

01:24:43.529 --> 01:24:45.794
<i>It's unclear what this means
for the economy,</i>

01:24:45.796 --> 01:24:48.560
<i>but we can expect the fallout
to last for a while.</i>

01:24:56.561 --> 01:24:59.061
- Hey, Alex. Time's up.
- What's going on?

01:24:59.063 --> 01:25:02.660
No. Alex!
You bastards! Alex!

01:25:07.162 --> 01:25:09.394
Where is Kira?
What have you done with her?

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:13.527
Hey, fuck you!
Fuck you!

01:25:14.895 --> 01:25:17.394
Where is Kira?

01:25:19.062 --> 01:25:21.219
We're just going to sit here?
Is that what's happening?

01:25:27.261 --> 01:25:29.061
Yeah.

01:25:31.129 --> 01:25:32.994
Yeah.

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:34.360
Let's go.

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:36.627
Who was that?

01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:40.394
That your mom?
You inviting her to the party?

01:25:40.396 --> 01:25:42.460
Quiet.

01:25:44.228 --> 01:25:47.094
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
What the fuck?!

01:26:45.895 --> 01:26:49.694
Uh... JFK as fast
as possible, please.

01:26:53.595 --> 01:26:55.794
I need to use your phone,
please.

01:27:01.996 --> 01:27:05.027
<i>The number you have called
is not assigned.</i>

01:27:05.029 --> 01:27:07.994
<i>Both Kira's and zed's
phones were disconnected.</i>

01:27:07.996 --> 01:27:10.527
<i>How was that possible?
Who set us up?</i>

01:27:10.529 --> 01:27:13.494
<i>Who were those guys that
kidnapped me, zed's people?</i>

01:27:13.496 --> 01:27:16.660
<i>I didn't know,
and I didn't know what to do.</i>

01:27:16.662 --> 01:27:20.827
<i>I had to go and meet Kira in the one place
where she said no one would ever find us.</i>

01:27:30.561 --> 01:27:34.494
<i>Here, I felt cut off
from the rest of the world.</i>

01:27:35.128 --> 01:27:36.293
<i>I was alone,</i>

01:27:36.295 --> 01:27:39.727
<i>and everything
was stacked against me.</i>

01:27:39.729 --> 01:27:42.093
<i>Kira and I agreed that
if anything happened,</i>

01:27:42.095 --> 01:27:46.927
<i>we'd meet at noon at the temple of
dawn two days after the operation.</i>

01:27:47.628 --> 01:27:49.627
<i>So I had to wait.</i>

01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:54.494
<i>And in that moment,
I remembered my parents.</i>

01:27:54.496 --> 01:27:57.861
<i>I had completely
forgotten about them.</i>

01:28:05.762 --> 01:28:10.026
<i>We are unavailable to take your call.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:28:10.028 --> 01:28:13.026
Hey, mom, dad.

01:28:13.028 --> 01:28:15.127
It's me, Alex.

01:28:15.129 --> 01:28:17.594
I'm sorry I haven't called.

01:28:17.596 --> 01:28:20.527
I'm sorry I kind of disappeared.

01:28:21.994 --> 01:28:26.060
I'm going to be home
in a few days. I promise.

01:28:26.062 --> 01:28:28.694
Yeah, I miss you.

01:28:30.261 --> 01:28:32.494
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

01:28:34.528 --> 01:28:37.761
Alex. Alex!

01:28:46.561 --> 01:28:49.227
- Cell phone. Hey, guy.
- Yeah?

01:28:49.229 --> 01:28:50.293
- Phone?
- Oh, yeah.

01:28:50.295 --> 01:28:53.427
- Yes, BlackBerry.
- No, cheaper.

01:28:53.429 --> 01:28:54.761
- Something cheaper.
- Cheap?

01:28:54.763 --> 01:28:58.260
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's cheap. 1,000 baht.

01:28:58.262 --> 01:28:59.927
- Half. 500 baht.
- No.

01:28:59.929 --> 01:29:01.627
- No?
- 600 baht.

01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:04.293
- Okay. 600.
- Yeah.

01:29:04.295 --> 01:29:05.560
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:29:05.562 --> 01:29:07.060
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

01:29:07.062 --> 01:29:08.427
Thank you.

01:29:20.628 --> 01:29:22.560
Can I have a single, please?

01:29:22.562 --> 01:29:24.494
Can I have your passport,
please?

01:29:24.496 --> 01:29:26.894
Yeah, yeah.
Do you have Internet?

01:29:26.896 --> 01:29:29.427
- The Internet doesn't work.
- No? Okay.

01:29:29.429 --> 01:29:33.560
- Your key.
- Thank you. Thanks.

01:30:01.261 --> 01:30:03.993
<i>I waited and waited for her,</i>

01:30:03.995 --> 01:30:06.594
<i>but she never showed up.</i>

01:30:09.428 --> 01:30:12.527
<i>Now I really felt alone again.</i>

01:30:12.529 --> 01:30:16.861
<i>No friends, no family, no one.</i>

01:30:23.328 --> 01:30:24.727
Excuse me.
What time is it?

01:30:24.729 --> 01:30:25.993
- Sorry?
- What time is it?

01:30:25.995 --> 01:30:29.193
Oh. Uh... 12:15.

01:30:29.195 --> 01:30:31.127
Thank you. Thanks.

01:30:49.061 --> 01:30:51.394
Excuse me.
What time is it?

01:30:51.396 --> 01:30:52.527
Uh, ten-to-three.

01:30:52.529 --> 01:30:54.960
Okay. Thank you.

01:31:02.128 --> 01:31:03.761
<i>I was lost.</i>

01:31:03.763 --> 01:31:07.727
<i>I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't know where to go,</i>

01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:10.860
<i>but I had a weird feeling
in my stomach.</i>

01:31:10.862 --> 01:31:13.627
<i>Something was off.</i>

01:31:18.861 --> 01:31:20.494
Hi. I need to
use the Internet.

01:31:20.496 --> 01:31:21.893
Okay. You pay first.

01:31:21.895 --> 01:31:25.960
Yeah. Yeah.
You take card, right?

01:31:25.962 --> 01:31:29.427
You go there, number five.
On the left.

01:31:29.429 --> 01:31:31.360
- Number five. Oh, yeah.
- The left.

01:31:31.362 --> 01:31:33.560
Yeah, left.

01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:09.193
<i>Days after the staged account on the
chairman of the federal reserve,</i>

01:32:09.195 --> 01:32:11.727
<i>the stock markets are finally
up and running again.</i>

01:32:11.729 --> 01:32:15.026
<i>The authorities apprehended those
responsible for the attack.</i>

01:32:15.028 --> 01:32:18.826
<i>The notorious computer hacker
zed has been taken into custody</i>

01:32:18.828 --> 01:32:22.460
<i>and will be charged with over
five dozen counts of wire fraud,</i>

01:32:22.462 --> 01:32:27.160
<i>as well as charges of insider
trading, tax evasion, and terrorism.</i>

01:32:27.162 --> 01:32:32.560
<i>The authorities have also shed light on
zed's partner in crime, Kira Whittal.</i>

01:32:32.562 --> 01:32:34.960
<i>Now, she's been with zed's
outfit from the very start.</i>

01:32:34.962 --> 01:32:38.860
<i>She was shot dead while attempting
to flee from federal agents.</i>

01:32:38.862 --> 01:32:42.694
<i>Police were compelled to use deadly
force when Whittal opened fire.</i>

01:32:42.696 --> 01:32:45.327
<i>How was that possible?</i>

01:32:45.329 --> 01:32:49.460
<i>And finally, a third conspirator
was arrested this morning.</i>

01:32:49.462 --> 01:32:52.327
<i>A Colombian businessman known
as Alfonso Regalo</i>

01:32:52.329 --> 01:32:56.127
<i>was apprehended when it was found that
his money financed the operation.</i>

01:32:56.129 --> 01:32:59.260
<i>No, she couldn't be dead. She must
have left a clue for me on her page.</i>

01:32:59.262 --> 01:33:01.160
Mobli. Okay.

01:33:09.261 --> 01:33:12.026
Excuse me.

01:33:12.028 --> 01:33:15.427
I'm not connected.
Can you reconnect me, please?

01:33:15.429 --> 01:33:17.193
- Can you connect...
- Hey, you.

01:33:17.195 --> 01:33:20.093
Your passport. You.

01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:22.093
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:22.095 --> 01:33:25.726
- Five minutes.
Five more minutes.

01:33:25.728 --> 01:33:28.260
No, no, it's very important.
Just go and press the button.

01:33:28.262 --> 01:33:30.960
- No! -Five minutes. What's "five
minutes" in Thai? Please.

01:33:30.962 --> 01:33:33.394
- Please come with us.
- I just need to talk to...

01:33:33.396 --> 01:33:35.260
- I just need to talk
to somebody.

01:33:35.262 --> 01:33:38.160
No, no, no. Please, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

01:33:38.162 --> 01:33:39.693
Somebody...
I need five minutes.

01:33:39.695 --> 01:33:41.026
Five minutes. Five...

01:33:41.028 --> 01:33:42.394
I need to talk to somebody!

01:33:42.396 --> 01:33:44.160
I just need five
fucking minutes!

01:33:44.162 --> 01:33:46.127
Can you please
give me five minutes?!

01:33:55.994 --> 01:33:57.826
No, no, no, no, no.
Listen. Just listen.

01:33:57.828 --> 01:33:59.560
If you'd just hear me out.

01:33:59.562 --> 01:34:00.793
Please. Come on.
You understand English?

01:34:00.795 --> 01:34:02.327
Can you stop for a second,
please?

01:34:02.329 --> 01:34:06.627
I just need five minutes.
Can you come back, please?

01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:09.926
I just need five minutes
on the Internet! I...

01:34:21.362 --> 01:34:25.527
<i>I'd hoped that Kira was still
alive and that she'd find me.</i>

01:34:25.529 --> 01:34:29.926
<i>With every day that went by,
I lost hope.</i>

01:34:34.695 --> 01:34:37.993
I've been asking for a while
now, and I really...

01:34:37.995 --> 01:34:42.460
I wouldn't mind... I really wouldn't mind
if I could just have... just five minutes.

01:34:42.462 --> 01:34:45.193
Five minutes is...
Is not a very long time!

01:34:45.195 --> 01:34:49.360
Five minutes on the Internet!
How fucking hard can it be?!

01:34:49.362 --> 01:34:51.026
How many times
do I have to ask?!

01:34:51.028 --> 01:34:54.260
I can fucking hear you!
I can hear you walking around!

01:34:54.262 --> 01:34:55.826
Can you at least say something?!

01:34:55.828 --> 01:34:59.893
Just say, "no"! Tell me no,
but don't fucking say nothing!

01:35:08.261 --> 01:35:10.527
Hey!

01:35:15.894 --> 01:35:18.227
<i>- And then...</i>
- Help me.

01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:20.460
<i>I resigned myself to it.</i>

01:35:20.462 --> 01:35:24.760
<i>I accepted the fact
that I was alone.</i>

01:35:26.395 --> 01:35:29.960
<i>My parents,
sye, Darkweb, Kira, zed,</i>

01:35:29.962 --> 01:35:33.160
<i>it was all so far away
and so long ago.</i>

01:35:33.162 --> 01:35:37.160
<i>Back then, I wanted to change
the world for the better,</i>

01:35:37.162 --> 01:35:39.860
<i>but now my world was dead.</i>

01:35:39.862 --> 01:35:44.026
<i>So I decided to just
give up on life.</i>

01:35:49.694 --> 01:35:52.427
<i>But life wasn't ready
to give up on me.</i>

01:36:03.294 --> 01:36:06.960
<i>I decided to stop living in the
past and just decided to live.</i>

01:36:06.962 --> 01:36:10.993
<i>Even if I lived like a caged
animal, I was still alive.</i>

01:36:12.194 --> 01:36:15.360
<i>I realized that by the time
I was 21 years old,</i>

01:36:15.362 --> 01:36:17.659
<i>I'd caused a lot of harm
to a lot of people,</i>

01:36:17.661 --> 01:36:22.494
<i>that I was responsible for the
death of the people I loved.</i>

01:36:24.027 --> 01:36:25.726
<i>Everything had changed,</i>

01:36:25.728 --> 01:36:29.893
<i>all the chaos,
the conspiracies, my beliefs.</i>

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:34.860
<i>It was all different.</i>

01:36:37.395 --> 01:36:40.526
<i>But I guess there was always that
one thing that never changed.</i>

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:45.659
<i>It killed me to know that
she'd sit and wait for me,</i>

01:36:45.661 --> 01:36:48.460
<i>and I'd never show up.</i>

01:36:48.462 --> 01:36:52.693
<i>I missed my parents.
I wanted to see them so badly.</i>

01:36:52.695 --> 01:36:55.227
<i>I wanted to hug them like
I'd never hugged them before.</i>

01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:58.360
<i>I wanted to sit down and
talk to them about nothing.</i>

01:36:58.362 --> 01:37:02.427
<i>I just wanted to be near them,
because they know who I am.</i>

01:37:02.429 --> 01:37:04.860
<i>I was done pretending
to be someone else.</i>

01:37:04.862 --> 01:37:08.160
<i>I just wanted
to be myself again.</i>

01:37:27.495 --> 01:37:31.093
<i>And then, after two years,
I was released.</i>

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:35.360
<i>I could hardly believe it, 'cause I
was released under my fake name,</i>

01:37:35.362 --> 01:37:37.426
<i>but the important thing was...</i>

01:37:37.428 --> 01:37:39.459
Furlong, you're free to go.

01:37:39.461 --> 01:37:41.459
<i>I was free,</i>

01:37:41.461 --> 01:37:45.426
<i>and I was finally ready
to go home.</i>

01:38:35.094 --> 01:38:37.860
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:38:39.994 --> 01:38:41.826
How are you here?

01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.826
You're obviously very good
at what you do,

01:38:47.828 --> 01:38:55.060
so if you'd like to get out of here
early and have a clean record...

01:38:55.062 --> 01:38:57.093
We have a job for you.

01:39:02.094 --> 01:39:04.559
<i>What the hell happened in there? Why'd
they let you go? What'd you tell 'em?</i>

01:39:04.561 --> 01:39:06.260
<i>I told 'em I wouldn't
do it again. They let me go.</i>

01:39:06.262 --> 01:39:07.659
<i>Just a little bit too easy.</i>

01:39:07.661 --> 01:39:12.793
We have a guy we think
can get us closer to him.

01:39:15.027 --> 01:39:18.559
- He's young.
- So are you.

01:39:18.561 --> 01:39:20.459
We'll give him a way
to get him interested in you.

01:39:20.461 --> 01:39:23.459
What do you know about
the New York stock exchange?

01:39:23.461 --> 01:39:25.926
<i>You're going to
help him make money,</i>

01:39:25.928 --> 01:39:28.693
<i>and we're going
to organize everything.</i>

01:39:28.695 --> 01:39:30.893
<i>And if anyone ever
gets suspicious,</i>

01:39:30.895 --> 01:39:32.659
<i>you just refer to me
as your uncle.</i>

01:39:32.661 --> 01:39:34.426
<i>Where do you find these guys?</i>

01:39:34.428 --> 01:39:36.693
<i>My uncle helped me.</i>

01:39:36.695 --> 01:39:38.793
<i>Then you're gonna need
to get him to Hong Kong.</i>

01:39:38.795 --> 01:39:41.493
Hong Kong is the place to be
for people like us.

01:39:41.495 --> 01:39:43.026
<i>What if he doesn't fall for it?</i>

01:39:43.028 --> 01:39:45.160
<i>We'll scare him into leaving.</i>

01:39:45.162 --> 01:39:48.193
<i>I've been thinking about
what happened today,</i>

01:39:48.195 --> 01:39:52.559
and I think it's a sign for us
to move somewhere else.

01:39:52.561 --> 01:39:56.093
<i>Once you're there, you'll need
to push the ATM operation on him</i>

01:39:56.095 --> 01:39:57.459
<i>so that zed notices you.</i>

01:39:57.461 --> 01:40:01.227
I was talking about the ATM's.

01:40:01.229 --> 01:40:04.160
<i>And we will always be
nearby if something goes wrong.</i>

01:40:04.162 --> 01:40:05.359
What happened? What's going on?

01:40:05.361 --> 01:40:08.060
My uncle.

01:40:08.062 --> 01:40:11.026
<i>What do you mean you
don't think he can do it?!</i>

01:40:11.028 --> 01:40:12.893
<i>Are you falling for him
or something?</i>

01:40:12.895 --> 01:40:15.793
<i>I had a different plan
for my life,</i>

01:40:15.795 --> 01:40:17.926
<i>and now it's just different.</i>

01:40:17.928 --> 01:40:21.260
Oh, my god. It's zed.

01:40:21.261 --> 01:40:24.893
<i>All we'll need is a paper trail that
shows that he financed the operation</i>

01:40:24.895 --> 01:40:27.926
<i>and that he knew about
the market collapse.</i>

01:40:27.928 --> 01:40:29.826
<i>We'll get him on
insider trading and fraud.</i>

01:40:29.828 --> 01:40:31.826
I need a clean out
for me and Alex.

01:40:31.828 --> 01:40:34.160
I will not do this if it means
him getting arrested.

01:40:34.162 --> 01:40:35.593
Do you understand me?

01:40:35.595 --> 01:40:37.127
<i>Sure, but...</i>

01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:38.359
<i>You can never see him again.</i>

01:40:38.361 --> 01:40:40.426
Fine.

01:40:40.428 --> 01:40:42.227
Where were you?

01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:43.227
Just using my phone.

01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:45.393
<i>I wasn't lying when I said</i>

01:40:45.395 --> 01:40:48.093
<i>we had to get
as far away as possible.</i>

01:40:48.095 --> 01:40:50.060
<i>I was going to meet you there
and tell you everything,</i>

01:40:50.062 --> 01:40:52.593
<i>but I didn't know that they had
other plans for me.</i>

01:40:52.595 --> 01:40:54.860
<i>Zed's partner
in crime, Kira Whittal,</i>

01:40:54.862 --> 01:40:59.326
<i>was shot dead while attempting
to flee from federal agents.</i>

01:40:59.328 --> 01:41:01.393
No. Alex! You bastards!

01:41:01.395 --> 01:41:02.726
<i>Alex!</i>

01:41:02.728 --> 01:41:04.426
<i>As soon as I got out,
I went looking for you.</i>

01:41:04.428 --> 01:41:08.893
<i>I knew the passport you had, so
it wasn't hard to track you down,</i>

01:41:08.895 --> 01:41:12.226
<i>but took me a while
to get you out.</i>

01:41:12.228 --> 01:41:14.593
<i>I wish I could have
sent you a note.</i>

01:41:14.595 --> 01:41:17.559
<i>I wish I could have told you
that I was coming,</i>

01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:22.426
but I couldn't risk it, in case they were
watching, so I had to wait till today.

01:41:29.094 --> 01:41:30.292
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:41:30.294 --> 01:41:31.726
I tried.

01:41:31.728 --> 01:41:33.793
No, you didn't.
You lied to me.

01:41:33.795 --> 01:41:36.760
You know... I never
really lied to you.

01:41:36.762 --> 01:41:40.026
I just didn't tell you
the whole truth.

01:41:41.427 --> 01:41:42.893
So, what are you doing here?

01:41:42.895 --> 01:41:45.926
Can I give you a ride home?

01:41:45.928 --> 01:41:49.093
Might have some trouble
crossing the border.

01:41:50.327 --> 01:41:52.493
Not if you use
your real passport.

01:41:59.994 --> 01:42:02.359
You okay to drive?

01:42:02.361 --> 01:42:05.060
Um-hmm.

01:42:07.827 --> 01:42:11.159
<i>In the end,
I got a chance to start over,</i>

01:42:11.161 --> 01:42:14.860
<i>live an honest life,
and make an honest living.</i>

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.659
<i>And, Kira, well,</i>

01:42:16.661 --> 01:42:19.526
<i>I was just happy she was alive.</i>
