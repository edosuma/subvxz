04:51.639 --> 04:53.815
- [Sgt. Turner] What is it?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.165
- Trouble.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.255
- [Sgt. Turner] Are you sure?

04:59.386 --> 05:01.431
I can't hear anything.

05:01.562 --> 05:02.345
[plane buzzing]

05:02.476 --> 05:05.174
- Bloody hell! Get off the path!

05:05.305 --> 05:06.784
- [Harris] Argh!

05:06.915 --> 05:09.918
[suspenseful music]

05:16.011 --> 05:19.580
- [Singh] Look out!
It's a Japanese patrol!

[birdsong sounding]

06:23.644 --> 06:26.342
[steps falling]

06:43.490 --> 06:45.535
- We could've 'ad 'em, Sarge.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.623
There was only two of 'em.

06:46.754 --> 06:47.711
- And the other three hundred

06:47.842 --> 06:48.843
back at the barracks, Harris,

06:48.973 --> 06:49.974
who'd come looking for them

06:50.105 --> 06:51.715
when they didn't turn up from
patrol.

06:51.846 --> 06:54.588
You have got to think before you
act.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.111
[Harris sighs]

06:56.241 --> 06:58.722
- With all due respect,
Sarge, what are we doing?

06:59.723 --> 07:02.247
I mean I know it's hush hush,
top secret and all that,

07:02.378 --> 07:05.773
but don't you think we deserve
to know what we're doing?

07:06.600 --> 07:09.037
Dropped off into some island
without even

07:09.167 --> 07:11.256
having the pleasure of taking on
any Japs.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
- That's on a need to know
basis, Harris.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.003
If any of us are captured,
it's gonna be best

07:19.134 --> 07:20.918
that we don't know anything.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.486
The Japanese have a knack
for making people talk.

07:26.184 --> 07:29.666
- Did you say three hundred
Japanese on the island, sir?

07:29.797 --> 07:31.407
- Give or take, yeah.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.582
- What about him?

07:32.713 --> 07:34.105
What's he doing here?

07:34.236 --> 07:36.673
- If you're referring to
Lance Daffadar Singh, Harris,

07:36.804 --> 07:39.937
he's on temporary transfer
from the 77th Indian Brigade.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.070
- Weren't there any
English lads available?

07:42.200 --> 07:45.116
- It was decided,
Harris, given the climate

07:45.247 --> 07:47.118
we're all enduring at the
moment,

07:47.249 --> 07:49.599
a man from the Indian
Brigade might just survive

07:49.730 --> 07:51.471
a four day trek without
succumbing

07:51.601 --> 07:54.822
to some tropical disease
of the digestive function.

07:57.607 --> 08:01.089
- Er, now that you mention it,
sir...

08:01.219 --> 08:02.307
- Mention what?

08:02.438 --> 08:04.179
- The digestive function, sir.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.835
- Well, you can have five
minutes, go on.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.445
Get well away from the path.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.230
And put that camera away, you
lose that

08:12.361 --> 08:13.971
this whole trip's for nothing.

08:14.102 --> 08:17.801
- Sir? May I also request five
minutes?

08:17.932 --> 08:18.889
- Fine.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.282
- Yeah and I need a piss an'
all.

08:20.412 --> 08:21.762
- Fine.

08:21.892 --> 08:22.980
- Thanks, Sarge.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.416
[birds chirping]

08:24.547 --> 08:26.593
- [Sgt. Turner] This is
going to be bloody tight.

08:28.420 --> 08:32.467
[foreboding instrumental music]

08:55.447 --> 08:58.538
[footsteps sounding]

09:02.150 --> 09:05.806
[suspenseful marimba music]

09:06.807 --> 09:08.156
- [Pike] What is it, Sarge?

09:09.026 --> 09:10.462
- Japanese fighter.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.856
Been here more than a
year by the looks of it.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.860
- Do you think it's one
of them kamikaze pilots?

09:16.991 --> 09:20.081
- If he was, he missed his
bleeding target, didn't he?

09:20.211 --> 09:22.518
Unless he was aiming for a
bleeding hole in the ground!

09:24.476 --> 09:25.608
- Save your film, Pike.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.567
We're not here to take holiday
snaps.

09:29.699 --> 09:30.874
- Yes sir.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.268
[birdsong echoing]

09:33.398 --> 09:36.358
[footsteps fading]

09:48.675 --> 09:53.680
[soothing music]

09:57.205 --> 09:58.380
[footsteps falling]

09:58.510 --> 10:01.513
- Sir, may I be so bold
as to make a suggestion?

10:02.863 --> 10:03.690
- You may.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.911
- Look, the light is dimming.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.436
When the sun falls behind the
tree line,

10:11.567 --> 10:15.223
I predict it will become
very dark, very quickly.

10:16.964 --> 10:20.445
I suggest we set up camp
as soon as possible.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.360
- I second that, Sarge.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.101
My feet are bleedin' killing me.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.537
- Well alright.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.801
I guess we're far enough
off the beaten track

10:27.931 --> 10:29.063
here to take a rest.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.413
You carrying the rations, Singh?

10:31.543 --> 10:32.414
- Yes sir.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.286
- Permission to light a fire,
Sarge?

10:35.417 --> 10:37.462
- Weather not warm enough for
you, Harris?

10:37.593 --> 10:39.073
- It's not that, Sarge.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.553
I just don't fancy having cold
baked beans for tea again.

10:41.684 --> 10:42.554
- Alright.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.993
Keep it under control.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.778
[ominous music]

11:06.274 --> 11:10.800
- Oi!

11:10.931 --> 11:12.584
What are you doing with my pack?

11:16.023 --> 11:18.025
- I believe you're carrying the
matches.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.331
To light the fire?

11:22.420 --> 11:23.508
- I'll light the fire.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.555
And don't touch my pack again.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.558
- What's the problem, Harris?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.865
- Well, you can't trust
'em, Sarge, can you?

11:33.301 --> 11:35.085
It's not like he's one of us, is
it?

11:36.913 --> 11:39.481
- D'you know, Harris, the men
of the 77th Indian Brigade,

11:39.611 --> 11:41.222
they're all volunteer fighters.

11:42.049 --> 11:42.963
Looking at the state of you

11:43.093 --> 11:45.269
I can only assume you were
drafted.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.488
- I volunteered.

11:46.618 --> 11:47.663
- When, 1944?

11:49.796 --> 11:50.797
Can't have been out here long,

11:50.927 --> 11:52.189
you'd have been used to the heat
by now.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.321
- I've done my bit.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.846
I volunteered for this mission,
didn't I?

11:58.152 --> 11:59.327
Whatever the hell we're doing
here.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.416
- Watch your mouth, Private!

12:03.113 --> 12:03.984
And keep it down.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.988
We're still in enemy territory
in case you'd forgotten.

12:10.077 --> 12:13.167
- Yes, Sarge.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.168
Sorry Sarge.

12:19.086 --> 12:22.132
- Well, is somebody
gonna cook these beans?

12:22.263 --> 12:23.960
I'm bloody starving.

12:24.091 --> 12:24.918
- Yes sir!

12:25.832 --> 12:28.617
[dramatic music]

12:33.578 --> 12:36.843
[soothing piano music]

12:57.689 --> 13:00.170
- 'Ere, what kind of gum you
got?

13:01.432 --> 13:04.392
- American, " Fruity Mint," or
something.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.223
I traded it for a pack
of fags with this Yank

13:09.353 --> 13:10.441
when I first came out.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.881
I'm saving it for a special
occasion.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.492
- Can I have a bit?

13:17.622 --> 13:21.061
- Fuck off! I've only got one
stick left.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.281
And I'm keeping it for when

13:24.412 --> 13:26.327
we're on that boat out of this
shit-hole.

13:29.243 --> 13:32.768
- See her? That's my fiancee,
Olive.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.773
Nice, ain't she?

13:39.775 --> 13:42.430
- Not now, Pike. My
stomach's giving me gyp.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.912
- I took these myself.

13:46.042 --> 13:49.524
My uncle's got a little
photography
studio down town centre.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.439
He's showing me how to run the
business.

13:51.569 --> 13:52.440
- Wonderful.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.660
- And when all of this is over,

13:55.791 --> 13:58.402
I'm gonna be a professional
photographer.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.318
You know, weddings,
babies, that sort of thing.

14:02.232 --> 14:06.933
And me and Olive, yeah,
we're gonna get married.

14:08.325 --> 14:09.500
- Bleedin' hell, Pike.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.852
Do you realize, you've
just reduced your chances

14:12.982 --> 14:15.637
of getting out of here alive
by about eighty percent

14:15.767 --> 14:16.768
by telling me that?

14:18.205 --> 14:19.510
[Harris sighing]

14:19.641 --> 14:22.078
Have you not seen the
picture about the last lot?

14:22.209 --> 14:23.688
- What, the Great War?

14:23.819 --> 14:26.343
- Yeah. The war to end
all wars, they said.

14:31.522 --> 14:32.306
- Did you fight in it?

14:32.436 --> 14:33.655
- I'm not that bloody old, am I?

14:35.265 --> 14:37.615
I just saw a lot of pictures
about it.

14:37.746 --> 14:42.751
And Pike, let me tell you
something.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.103
The lad that waves around a
photograph

14:47.234 --> 14:48.888
of his beloved fiancee back
home,

14:49.976 --> 14:50.759
[Harris sighs]

14:50.890 --> 14:53.022
he never makes it to the end.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.895
[fire crackling]

14:59.246 --> 15:01.770
- Aren't you lads gonna get some
sleep?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.033
Long trek tomorrow to
get where we're going.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.296
- Yeah, I thought there might
be.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.907
This didn't look like a very big
island,

15:08.037 --> 15:10.344
but it's taking us
bloody ages to cross it.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.478
- With the greatest of
respect to you, Mr Harris.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.828
I don't believe we are
crossing the island.

15:16.959 --> 15:17.873
- What?

15:18.004 --> 15:20.832
- Unless I am mistaken, I
believe

15:20.963 --> 15:22.617
we are going around the edge.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.228
- What makes you say that?

15:27.883 --> 15:30.407
- Earlier on in the day, when
the wind

15:30.538 --> 15:32.366
was blowing in the right
direction,

15:32.496 --> 15:34.934
I could detect the sound of the
ocean,

15:35.064 --> 15:38.415
even after walking for
all these many hours.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.591
- Why the bleedin' hell are
we going around the edge?

15:40.722 --> 15:44.291
- The centre of Ramree
Island is impassable, sir.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.296
We will definitely fail our
mission

15:49.426 --> 15:51.428
if we try to cross it directly.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.213
- How do you know that?

15:53.343 --> 15:54.997
Does he know where we are?

15:55.128 --> 15:58.174
How come he gets to know
where we are and I don't?

15:58.305 --> 15:59.784
I'm more senior than him.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.613
- Technically, sir, Lance
Daffadar

16:02.744 --> 16:04.833
is a higher rank than Private.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.402
- Shut it! An Englishman
out ranks any of you lot.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.838
Tell him, Sarge.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.187
- Keep your voices down.

16:12.232 --> 16:13.059
All of you!

16:17.019 --> 16:19.065
- Apologies for the
misunderstanding, sir.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.503
Sgt Turner didn't tell me
anything.

16:23.591 --> 16:26.072
I merely calculated our location

16:26.202 --> 16:27.943
with the evidence available,

16:28.074 --> 16:30.467
just like your very own Sherlock
Holmes.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.817
- What's he on about?

16:32.948 --> 16:34.254
- Explain yourself, Singh.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.997
- Well sir, first of all,

16:38.127 --> 16:40.477
I knew we weren't too far from
Burma.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.523
That is what narrowed it down.

16:42.653 --> 16:43.741
- Narrowed it down?

16:44.786 --> 16:47.919
There are over eight hundred
islands in this area, Singh.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.184
- Yes sir. But not as many
Japanese bases

16:51.314 --> 16:54.622
with three hundred men, and
even less with an air strip.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.843
I examined the wreckage earlier
sir.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.063
It's not battle-damaged.

17:02.630 --> 17:06.547
I believe the plane crashed
on either take off or landing.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.116
- Very good, Singh.

17:11.682 --> 17:12.814
What about our mission?

17:14.945 --> 17:16.470
You figured that out as well?

17:17.992 --> 17:19.386
- No, no sir.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.173
Except to say...

17:24.304 --> 17:25.131
- Yes?

17:27.089 --> 17:30.310
- Well, the young man and his
camera...

17:31.615 --> 17:32.486
- What about me?

17:34.009 --> 17:37.056
- With the greatest of
respect, Private Pike,

17:37.186 --> 17:40.450
I don't believe you're here
to show your battle skills.

17:42.365 --> 17:47.153
I believe you're here to show
your photographic skills.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.197
- Is that it, sir?

17:49.068 --> 17:51.157
Are we just gonna take
photographs of the base?

17:51.287 --> 17:52.114
- Not quite.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.814
We have aerial photographs
that precisely locate

17:56.945 --> 17:58.555
the position of the base.

17:58.686 --> 18:02.472
What we don't have is the
position of their munitions
store.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.608
Well the Japanese aren't stupid,

18:07.738 --> 18:09.218
they're not gonna locate the
store

18:09.349 --> 18:11.090
near where their lads sleep,

18:11.960 --> 18:12.874
and they're not gonna store it

18:13.004 --> 18:14.484
where we can see it from the
air.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.270
But we know it's there, 'cause
we've seen

18:17.400 --> 18:20.142
boats coming and going for
months bringing the stuff in.

18:22.405 --> 18:25.191
If we can pinpoint the location
of the munitions store,

18:26.235 --> 18:29.760
get a good image of it to
give to the lads in the RAF,

18:29.891 --> 18:32.198
they stand a good chance of
scoring a direct hit on it,

18:32.328 --> 18:34.896
and then, boom!

18:35.026 --> 18:36.245
- Bloody Japs.

18:36.376 --> 18:37.551
They won't know what's hit 'em.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.945
- Right. Which means the
follow-up attack by land

18:41.076 --> 18:43.861
stands a very good chance
of taking the island back,

18:43.992 --> 18:46.516
with the added benefit
of a very nice airstrip.

18:48.257 --> 18:53.001
So, this is why it was supposed
to be a tightly-kept secret.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.439
The Japanese get word that
we're planning an attack,

18:56.570 --> 18:58.049
they'll be ready for us.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.747
We won't stand a chance.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.055
Now, unless there are any more
questions,

19:04.186 --> 19:08.973
what I would suggest is,
no, what I would command is,

19:09.104 --> 19:11.628
you get your heads down, get
some sleep.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.631
Soon as the sun's up, we're on
the move.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.025
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

19:18.896 --> 19:19.984
- [Sgt. Turner] Harris?

19:21.421 --> 19:23.074
- Just one question, sir.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.467
- What's that?

19:24.598 --> 19:27.644
- Well, if we did encounter
some of those Japs,

19:27.775 --> 19:29.429
and they were trying to kill us,

19:29.559 --> 19:33.215
and it was situation like
them or us, can we kill 'em?

19:35.609 --> 19:37.915
- Orders are not to engage.

19:38.873 --> 19:39.613
- Fuckin' 'ell.

19:39.743 --> 19:40.614
- What was that?

19:41.615 --> 19:42.442
- Nothing, Sarge.

19:43.399 --> 19:44.618
- I hope it was nothing.

19:45.749 --> 19:46.707
Get some sleep.

19:46.837 --> 19:49.666
[birdsong ringing]

19:49.797 --> 19:52.495
[ominous music]

20:01.156 --> 20:04.246
[flashback whooshes]

20:05.465 --> 20:06.292
[nostalgic music]

20:06.422 --> 20:09.251
[boys chattering]

20:21.045 --> 20:23.961
[machine guns stuttering]

20:24.092 --> 20:26.964
[bombs exploding]

20:32.535 --> 20:35.277
[birds chirping]

20:40.326 --> 20:43.329
[suspenseful music]

21:07.614 --> 21:08.484
- Oi!

21:08.615 --> 21:09.355
[blows landing]

21:09.485 --> 21:10.138
[Japanese soldier grunting]

21:10.269 --> 21:11.270
[Dramatic music]

21:11.400 --> 21:12.227
[punches landing]

21:12.358 --> 21:13.272
[Japanese soldier grunting]

21:13.402 --> 21:16.275
[Harris exerting]

21:19.408 --> 21:20.453
[soldier falling]

21:20.583 --> 21:23.282
[neck snapping]

21:24.413 --> 21:25.109
[footsteps approaching]

21:25.240 --> 21:26.415
[dramatic music]

21:26.546 --> 21:28.765
- Oi, Pike! Get your camera out!

21:30.071 --> 21:31.725
I want to take a picture for me
mum.

21:32.726 --> 21:33.727
- What the bloody hell

21:33.857 --> 21:35.859
do you think you're playing at,
Harris?

21:35.990 --> 21:37.296
- I had to do it, Sarge.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.558
They were onto us.

21:38.688 --> 21:41.604
- Really? Well they certainly
will be now.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.214
Right, back to camp.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.433
Get packed up.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.087
We're moving out now.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.611
- Come on! Just one picture!

21:52.572 --> 21:54.400
[footsteps falling]

21:54.530 --> 21:56.358
I mean, what type of war is
this,

21:57.577 --> 21:59.753
if we can't take out a few Japs?

22:03.060 --> 22:04.192
[revolver cocking]

22:04.323 --> 22:05.498
[bow discharges]

22:05.628 --> 22:10.285
[arrow whooshes]
[Japanese soldier grunting]

22:13.767 --> 22:15.246
- Where did you learn to do
that?

22:15.377 --> 22:18.249
- We have a very similar
plant in India, sir.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.600
[birdsong sounding]

22:20.730 --> 22:21.949
- Ow!

22:22.079 --> 22:24.386
- Be careful Mr Harris,
sir, it's very sharp.

22:24.517 --> 22:25.431
- Now you tell me!

22:28.259 --> 22:31.654
It strikes me, you could
be quite a dangerous man.

22:31.785 --> 22:35.266
- Only in the service of
the British Empire, sir.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.267
- If you say so.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.836
- Shall we catch up with the
others?

22:39.967 --> 22:41.316
- I'm watching you.

22:41.447 --> 22:44.450
[suspenseful music]

22:52.283 --> 22:55.678
[running footsteps]

22:55.809 --> 22:57.680
- Oh, good of you to grace us
with your presence, Harris.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.203
Are you ready to move on?

22:59.334 --> 23:02.076
- Look Sarge, if they'd
found us all asleep,

23:02.206 --> 23:03.686
we'd all be dead by now.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.167
- Don't give me that, you
went out looking for trouble.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.560
You certainly found it,

23:07.690 --> 23:09.692
you have put this mission
into serious jeopardy.

23:09.823 --> 23:10.998
- How d'you reckon that?

23:11.128 --> 23:13.304
- According to the plan
we've got a two-day walk

23:13.435 --> 23:15.263
until we get to the Japanese
base,

23:15.394 --> 23:17.396
three-day walk back to the
pick-up point.

23:18.919 --> 23:21.312
- You may not have noticed
but those Japanese soldiers

23:21.443 --> 23:24.620
you took on weren't carrying
supplies, so,

23:25.795 --> 23:26.883
less than a day's walk

23:27.014 --> 23:28.885
from some sort of Japanese
encampment.

23:29.016 --> 23:32.367
Let's be generous, say eight
hours,

23:33.629 --> 23:36.327
sixteen hours before
they realize back at base

23:36.458 --> 23:38.199
they're not coming back from
patrol,

23:38.329 --> 23:40.201
send troops out looking for
them,

23:40.331 --> 23:41.463
find the bodies.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.727
Assuming they've got a field
radio,

23:45.728 --> 23:48.383
every soldier on this
island is looking for us

23:48.514 --> 23:50.472
24 hours from now.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.260
- Apologies for the
interruption, sir,

23:56.391 --> 23:57.827
but the Japanese would have
guessed

23:57.958 --> 24:00.003
we are targeting the munitions
store.

24:00.134 --> 24:01.744
They will double the guard at
least.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.050
- You shut up!

24:03.180 --> 24:04.051
- He's right.

24:05.008 --> 24:08.272
We may evade the search, but
we're stuffed

24:08.403 --> 24:10.753
if we don't get near that
munitions store.

24:11.754 --> 24:14.409
- Might it be as well to
abandon the mission, sir?

24:14.540 --> 24:15.541
- I've considered all the
options,

24:15.671 --> 24:17.456
Pike, including that one.

24:18.979 --> 24:21.068
But the pick-up boat's not
coming back 'til Tuesday

24:21.198 --> 24:22.373
and we're sitting ducks if we're

24:22.504 --> 24:24.114
waiting around in the meantime.

24:25.551 --> 24:28.597
The only course of action
is to change the route.

24:34.081 --> 24:34.951
[map thudding]

24:35.082 --> 24:36.431
Look at the shape of the island,

24:36.562 --> 24:38.955
long, thin, like a cucumber.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.697
That's why it's taking so
long to go round the edge.

24:41.828 --> 24:43.482
But if we went straight across,

24:43.612 --> 24:45.658
as the crow flies, we might

24:45.788 --> 24:48.182
just be there in under 24 hours.

24:49.270 --> 24:50.967
- But sir, the terrain?

24:51.098 --> 24:53.448
- Is swampland, yes I know that
Mr Singh.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.755
But I thought that was one your
strengths,

24:55.885 --> 24:58.279
you were brought up in this
kind of climate, weren't you?

24:58.409 --> 24:59.672
- They say the swamplands

24:59.802 --> 25:02.849
of Ramree Island are almost
impassable.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.981
- You're not scared of
getting your feet wet are you?

25:05.112 --> 25:06.896
- My Olive got pneumonia once,

25:07.027 --> 25:08.637
they said that was from
getting her feet wet.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.291
- Well that was in England.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.379
You're not gonna get pneumonia
out here,

25:11.510 --> 25:12.511
it's too bloody hot.

25:12.641 --> 25:15.818
- Quiet! This isn't up for
discussion

25:15.949 --> 25:16.993
now get moving.

25:26.655 --> 25:27.700
- Shit!

25:27.830 --> 25:29.658
[grenades rolling]

25:29.789 --> 25:30.616
- What's this?

25:32.313 --> 25:33.575
- It's just a few grenades,
Sarge.

25:33.706 --> 25:34.881
- And who authorized you to
bring them?

25:35.011 --> 25:37.492
- Well, it was on my own
initiative, sir.

25:37.623 --> 25:38.580
- Initiative?

25:39.973 --> 25:42.845
I've seen more initiative
in a goldfish, Harris.

25:42.976 --> 25:43.803
What were you gonna do with them

25:43.933 --> 25:45.326
on a reconnaissance mission?

25:47.371 --> 25:48.808
One of those goes off,

25:48.938 --> 25:52.289
every Japanese soldier
within earshot's after us.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.031
Four of us versus three hundred.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.555
How do you think that's gonna
work out?

25:56.685 --> 25:58.992
- I just wanna blow a
few of those bastards up.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.210
Isn't that what we're here for?

26:00.341 --> 26:02.212
- You are here to protect the
interests

26:02.343 --> 26:04.040
of the British Empire in
whatever way

26:04.171 --> 26:06.608
your superior officers see fit.

26:07.522 --> 26:10.351
You may want to go out in
a blaze of glory, Harris,

26:10.481 --> 26:11.526
the rest of us would quite like

26:11.657 --> 26:14.224
to get off this island in one
piece.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.140
- What shall we do with them,
sir?

26:17.271 --> 26:19.360
- I've half a mind to leave them
here.

26:19.490 --> 26:20.883
But that'd be like leaving a
trail

26:21.014 --> 26:23.364
of breadcrumbs for the Japanese.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.061
No, put them in your pack,
Singh.

26:25.192 --> 26:26.323
- Aw Sarge!

26:26.454 --> 26:27.934
Anyone but him!

26:28.064 --> 26:29.326
You can't trust 'em.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.720
Right now, I'd sooner trust him
than you.

26:31.851 --> 26:32.982
- But he isn't even English!

26:33.113 --> 26:34.593
- Now get moving.

26:40.424 --> 26:41.338
[birds chirping]

26:41.469 --> 26:44.515
[suspenseful music]

26:49.390 --> 26:50.347
[water birds and frogs
chattering]

26:50.478 --> 26:53.263
This is it lads, straight on
through.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.919
- Told you we were gonna get out
feet wet.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.443
- Well how deep do you think it
gets?

26:59.574 --> 27:01.054
'Cause I'm not much of a
swimmer.

27:01.184 --> 27:01.968
- [Sgt. Turner] I don't
think it'll come over

27:02.098 --> 27:03.273
your head, Pike.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.406
Come on, we've no time to lose.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.451
I don't much fancy wading
through this lot in the dark

27:07.582 --> 27:09.584
but I don't think we've got much
choice.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.589
- Forgive me, sir, but what is
that?

27:15.764 --> 27:16.896
[suspenseful music]

27:17.026 --> 27:19.725
[birds chirping]

27:22.292 --> 27:23.511
- Jesus Christ!

27:29.212 --> 27:31.388
- It's a Japanese soldier.

27:33.869 --> 27:36.002
- I wonder what he was doing out
here?

27:36.132 --> 27:37.481
- And what happened to him?

27:38.787 --> 27:40.876
- I read something about the
Japanese.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.052
If one of their men disgraces
his unit,

27:44.097 --> 27:46.926
they send him out to the
countryside with a sword.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.275
And then?

27:48.405 --> 27:50.407
Well and then he kills himself.

27:50.538 --> 27:53.280
Takes his sword and puts
it right through his guts.

27:53.410 --> 27:54.585
I don't know how they could do
it.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.196
I couldn't do it.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.894
It's called Harry something.

27:59.025 --> 28:00.330
- Harakiri.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.245
- You heard of it, sir?
[birds chirping urgently]

28:02.376 --> 28:03.769
- I've seen them do it, Pike.

28:05.553 --> 28:09.078
But if that was the case,
what's happened to his sword?

28:10.993 --> 28:13.953
- Never mind that, what
happened to his bleedin' legs?

28:14.083 --> 28:14.867
D'you think he chopped 'em off

28:14.997 --> 28:16.651
and they ran away on their own?

28:16.782 --> 28:19.785
[suspenseful music]

28:26.052 --> 28:28.663
- Sir? This could be a
worrying development.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.622
What if there's something in the
water?

28:33.450 --> 28:34.321
- We move on.

28:43.634 --> 28:46.812
[army boots sloshing]

28:49.162 --> 28:50.467
[crickets chirping]

28:50.598 --> 28:52.295
- Can you really tell where
we are on there, Sarge?

28:52.426 --> 28:53.427
- As long as we keep going

28:53.557 --> 28:55.124
in a straight line we'll be on
course.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.604
- A straight line!

28:57.692 --> 28:59.476
We could be going around
in circles for all we know.

28:59.607 --> 29:02.262
- We're going east, Harris.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.700
All I need is a compass to
confirm that.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.963
- Sgt. Turner is correct.

29:08.094 --> 29:11.010
I've been tracking our progress
in line with the stars.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.533
- The stars?

29:12.663 --> 29:14.404
How ridiculous, how can you see

29:14.535 --> 29:16.319
the stars through all that fog?

29:16.450 --> 29:17.973
- Well, I could earlier.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.410
[Pike yawns]

29:20.541 --> 29:22.064
- You all right, Pike?

29:22.195 --> 29:22.978
- Just tired, sir.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.241
- Aah, is it past your bedtime?

29:25.372 --> 29:26.895
- That's enough, Harris.

29:27.026 --> 29:28.027
- Sorry, Sarge.

29:28.897 --> 29:32.509
- Actually, Sarge, I've just
been thinking

29:32.640 --> 29:35.991
about what Harris said, about
all those old war pictures,

29:36.949 --> 29:38.777
and the lads who didn't make it
home.

29:40.169 --> 29:41.649
Just got me thinking 'bout
Olive, is all,

29:41.780 --> 29:46.480
and, you know, who's going to
look after her if I don't...

29:47.089 --> 29:49.875
- Pike, I wouldn't take any
notice about what I say.

29:50.745 --> 29:53.008
I'm just a miserable old git who
spends

29:53.139 --> 29:55.706
too much time at the pictures,
aren't I?

29:55.837 --> 29:59.493
- Yeah, well, I bet you've seen
more of the war than I have.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.669
- To be honest, Sarge was right.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.237
I only signed up last year.

30:06.282 --> 30:07.762
Well how come you weren't
drafted?

30:07.893 --> 30:09.242
It's a long story.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.028
- Still, you didn't need to sign
up

30:13.159 --> 30:14.638
for this mission, did you?

30:14.769 --> 30:15.988
- Well, I thought I was gonna be

30:16.118 --> 30:17.250
blowing something up, didn't I?

30:17.380 --> 30:18.599
- Quiet, Harris!

30:19.426 --> 30:20.340
You don't know how close we
might be

30:20.470 --> 30:22.255
to a Japanese encampment.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.344
- Even the Japanese have
got more sense than to camp

30:24.474 --> 30:26.476
in the middle of a bloody swamp.

30:26.607 --> 30:27.782
Ain't that right, Pike?
[Sgt. Turner whooshes]

30:27.913 --> 30:29.175
[compass splashing]

30:29.305 --> 30:32.395
- Jesus Christ, Harris,
look what you made me do!

30:32.526 --> 30:33.962
- What was that?

30:34.093 --> 30:35.834
- The compass, it's in the
water, somewhere over there.

30:35.964 --> 30:36.922
Start searching.

30:38.749 --> 30:41.796
[suspenseful music]

30:44.407 --> 30:45.191
- Have we got another one?

30:45.321 --> 30:46.540
- No, not me.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.586
- What happens if we can't find
it?

30:53.112 --> 30:55.549
- Sgt. Turner, sir, can I
have use of the torch, sir?

30:55.679 --> 30:58.421
I think I saw something here.

30:58.552 --> 30:59.988
- Yes, all right.

31:06.603 --> 31:09.824
[Sgt. Turner yells]
[Water splashes]

31:09.955 --> 31:11.478
- What's happened?

31:13.045 --> 31:15.003
- Looks like the Sarge has gone
arse over tit in the water.

31:15.134 --> 31:16.004
[Harris laughs]

31:16.135 --> 31:18.137
Sarge?

31:18.267 --> 31:19.529
Sarge?

31:19.660 --> 31:21.488
- Sarge?
- Give me that!

31:21.618 --> 31:24.708
Sarge! Sarge! Sarge!

31:25.927 --> 31:27.059
- Please, sir! Quiet!

31:27.189 --> 31:29.017
The enemy could be nearby.

31:30.453 --> 31:31.367
- Never mind that.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.718
It could be right in front of
me.

31:36.198 --> 31:37.547
Pike?

31:37.678 --> 31:39.636
- Erm, I was just looking at the
water.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.291
- So maybe you took your chance

31:42.422 --> 31:44.772
while no one was looking, huh?

31:45.816 --> 31:46.861
- Really, sir?

31:48.080 --> 31:49.211
I must protest...

31:49.342 --> 31:51.779
- Come on, Harris, he's
on our side, surely?

31:51.910 --> 31:52.780
- Is he?

31:53.912 --> 31:57.045
There's a lot them that
don't like us, us English.

31:58.046 --> 32:00.222
I've even heard some of you
are siding with the Japs.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.703
- Please, Mr Harris sir, I can
assure you

32:02.833 --> 32:04.574
I wasn't part of that faction.

32:04.705 --> 32:07.055
My family was hugely benefiting
by trading

32:07.186 --> 32:08.709
with the British Empire.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.146
How could I make Sgt. Turner
disappear?

32:11.277 --> 32:12.539
- I don't know.

32:13.714 --> 32:16.195
You were looking pretty
handy this morning though.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.285
Maybe the Sarge is floating down
the river

32:19.415 --> 32:21.852
with a bleedin' tropical
leaf stuck in his neck?

32:25.117 --> 32:27.946
- Really, sir? With the utmost
respect,

32:28.076 --> 32:29.773
can you stop wasting time,

32:29.904 --> 32:32.341
so I can resume my
search for the Sergeant?

32:33.647 --> 32:34.691
- You listen to me.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.260
In the absence of a commanding
officer,

32:39.696 --> 32:40.959
I'm the most senior here

32:42.047 --> 32:44.223
and I'm running this shit-show
now.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.442
- In that case, sir, shouldn't
you

32:46.573 --> 32:49.619
be using this valuable time
trying

32:49.750 --> 32:51.447
to figure a way out of this
swamp?

32:52.535 --> 32:55.234
- Come on, Harris, he's right.

32:55.364 --> 32:57.801
We should be looking for the
compass.

32:57.932 --> 33:00.804
You don't really think
he killed Sarge do you?

33:00.935 --> 33:04.286
- From now on, you don't
go out of my sight.

33:04.417 --> 33:05.244
You got that?

33:07.768 --> 33:08.595
- Yes sir.

33:08.725 --> 33:10.858
[bird cawing]

33:10.989 --> 33:11.946
- I'm watching you.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.731
Now get looking for that
compass.

33:16.603 --> 33:17.343
- Yes sir.

33:17.473 --> 33:18.344
- Yes sir.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.347
[water sloshing]

33:21.477 --> 33:24.654
- May I point out a
small inaccuracy you made

33:24.785 --> 33:27.309
in an earlier statement, Mr
Harris?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.615
[Pike sloshing water]

33:28.745 --> 33:31.792
[suspenseful music]

33:33.141 --> 33:36.797
As you know, my rank is of Lance
Dafadar.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.582
You and Mr Pike are Privates.

33:44.370 --> 33:45.893
So as far as your claim goes,

33:46.024 --> 33:47.634
as being the senior man,

33:47.764 --> 33:49.114
I'm really sorry to say,

33:49.244 --> 33:51.638
that is specifically incorrect,
sir.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.731
[water splashing]

33:57.861 --> 33:59.820
- Don't push your bleedin' luck,
Singh.

34:00.951 --> 34:02.083
I've just about had enough of...

34:02.214 --> 34:03.128
Jesus Christ!

34:04.607 --> 34:05.652
- What is it?

34:05.782 --> 34:07.219
- Something just went past my
leg!

34:09.569 --> 34:10.264
[Pike yells]

34:10.396 --> 34:11.701
- Pike! What is it?

34:11.831 --> 34:14.094
- I, er, found the compass.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.706
[monkey chattering]

34:17.838 --> 34:19.753
- You gave me a bleedin' heart
attack.

34:19.882 --> 34:21.014
[water bubbling]
[dramatic music]

34:21.146 --> 34:22.538
- Look, there!

34:22.668 --> 34:23.626
- [Harris] What?

34:23.757 --> 34:24.627
- There's something in the
water!

34:24.757 --> 34:25.889
- [Harris] Where?

34:26.020 --> 34:27.021
[water bubbling]

34:27.152 --> 34:28.152
- Don't shoot!

34:28.283 --> 34:29.806
The Japanese!

34:29.937 --> 34:32.896
- I couldn't care less about
the Japanese at this point!

34:33.027 --> 34:35.594
I'm more concerned about
what just went past my leg.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.902
- I suggest we move very
quickly!

34:40.034 --> 34:41.469
- Pike, which way is east?

34:41.601 --> 34:42.775
- Uh,

34:42.906 --> 34:43.603
[water creature growling]

34:43.733 --> 34:44.908
It's that way!

34:45.039 --> 34:46.867
- Wait! What is that?

34:48.172 --> 34:49.391
- It's the Sarge!

34:49.522 --> 34:50.652
- Somebody get him up.

34:54.179 --> 34:58.748
[ominous music]
[water sloshing]

34:58.879 --> 35:00.185

[all screaming]

35:01.142 --> 35:03.753
[water splashing]

35:03.884 --> 35:04.624
- Fuck me!

35:04.754 --> 35:05.755
- Don't shoot, sir!

35:05.886 --> 35:06.669
The Japanese!

35:06.800 --> 35:07.801
- Fuck the Japanese!

35:09.368 --> 35:10.630
- It's not going to work.

35:10.760 --> 35:11.718
The pistol!

35:13.633 --> 35:14.416
- What are you on about?

35:14.547 --> 35:15.548
- They have very thick hides!

35:15.678 --> 35:16.549
- What do?

35:21.728 --> 35:22.598
- Crocodiles.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.996
- Let's get out of here!

35:29.127 --> 35:31.390
[ominous music]

[all grunting]

36:00.070 --> 36:02.943
- Well, we made it. [grunts]

36:03.073 --> 36:04.249
[birds and crickets singing]

36:04.379 --> 36:04.945
I never thought we were gonna
see the end

36:05.075 --> 36:06.599
of that bleedin' swamp.

36:06.729 --> 36:07.730
[Pike sighs]

36:07.861 --> 36:09.950
Permission to have a rest sir?

36:10.080 --> 36:11.299
- Why are you asking me?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.955
- I believe you volunteered

36:15.782 --> 36:18.828
to take over the mission last
night, sir.

36:18.959 --> 36:22.441
- Hah! Yeah, that's a laugh,
innit?

36:26.532 --> 36:28.838
[water splashing]

36:28.969 --> 36:32.015
- Are you suggesting we give up?

36:33.016 --> 36:33.887
- I'm suggesting

36:34.931 --> 36:36.498
you tell me

36:36.629 --> 36:39.632
everything you know about
crocodiles.

36:39.762 --> 36:42.330
[haunting music]

36:42.461 --> 36:44.419
- Not very much, sir.

36:44.550 --> 36:47.509
But we do have them in India.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.641
The same type.

36:49.598 --> 36:53.298
The saltwater crocodile.
[ominous music]

36:54.821 --> 36:58.520
[water splashing]
[haunting music]

36:58.651 --> 36:59.695
- That ain't salt water.

36:59.826 --> 37:00.957
- No, sir.

37:01.088 --> 37:02.350
It's,

37:02.481 --> 37:04.178
It's just the name of the breed.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.225
- Well, how do you know?

37:07.355 --> 37:09.139
We haven't even seen one.

37:09.270 --> 37:12.839
- It's the kind of breed that
lives in these swamplands.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.362
It is the same back home.

37:14.493 --> 37:15.189
- What are you?

37:15.320 --> 37:16.538
A crocodile expert now?

37:16.669 --> 37:19.367
- No, not at all, sir.

37:19.498 --> 37:23.632
But, I did see one attack a man
once.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.026
- What happened?

37:28.724 --> 37:30.726
- I was very, very young.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.424
[nostalgic music]

37:32.554 --> 37:37.167
Me and a few friends decided
to go on an expedition

37:37.298 --> 37:38.473
out of the city.

37:39.866 --> 37:42.869
We were reading up about your
very own Dr. Livingstone.

37:43.913 --> 37:46.916
So we imagined we will be
exploring

37:47.047 --> 37:49.310
the farthest reaches of Africa.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.879
Just three young boys and a
pani-wallah.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.272
- What's that?

37:54.402 --> 37:56.230
- It's a man who carried the
water for us.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.971
- What, like a servant?

37:58.101 --> 37:59.407
- Yes.

37:59.538 --> 38:02.236
He was sent from home by my
father.

38:02.367 --> 38:05.587
- Christ, I never knew
you lot had servants.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.981
I thought you were the servants.

38:08.111 --> 38:12.246
- He was from a very low
caste and I feel ashamed

38:12.377 --> 38:14.335
because we treated him very
poorly.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.861
He begged us not to go
into the swamp water

38:18.992 --> 38:21.821
because he knew we would ruin
our shoes

38:21.951 --> 38:23.388
and he would get the blame.

38:24.954 --> 38:28.915
But we didn't listen to him
because we didn't respect him.

38:29.045 --> 38:32.092
[melancholic music]

38:32.222 --> 38:34.050
One of us found some sticks

38:34.181 --> 38:37.445
so we decided to go fishing
by the water's edge.

38:38.620 --> 38:42.624
And then it appeared out of
nowhere!

38:42.755 --> 38:45.105
[dramatic music]

38:45.235 --> 38:48.761
A huge, monstrous scaly
head come out of the water.

38:50.415 --> 38:55.158
This poor man put himself
between us and the crocodile.

38:58.858 --> 39:02.252
It was so fast like it
was with the Sergeant.

39:04.211 --> 39:06.822
- You knew all this and
you let us go wandering

39:06.953 --> 39:10.217
into a crocodile-infested swamp
without telling us anything?

39:10.348 --> 39:13.089
- No, I tried to warn the
Sergeant,

39:13.220 --> 39:14.743
but he was most insistent.

39:14.874 --> 39:17.093
- Well, you didn't do a
very good job, did you?

39:17.224 --> 39:19.095
- I was thinking about the
mission.

39:25.798 --> 39:28.104
- All right.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.193
We've still got a mission to
accomplish

39:31.151 --> 39:32.587
for what it's bleedin' worth.

39:34.937 --> 39:36.286
We've still got the compass,

39:37.200 --> 39:38.463
we've still got the camera

39:39.464 --> 39:41.770
and we've still got the
grenades.

39:41.901 --> 39:46.122
So just maybe, maybe we can
make something worthwhile

39:46.253 --> 39:47.820
out of this shit-show yet.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.475
[dramatic music]

39:50.605 --> 39:52.128
Let's get a couple of hour's kip

39:53.173 --> 39:54.130
[Harris sighs]

39:54.261 --> 39:55.610
and then we'll head east.

39:56.481 --> 39:57.525
See what we can find.

40:11.234 --> 40:14.586
[leaves rustling]
[birds calling]

40:14.716 --> 40:16.414
- Who is that in the picture?

40:16.544 --> 40:18.285
- Don't tell him, Pike!

40:18.416 --> 40:20.896
- My fiancee, Olive.

40:21.027 --> 40:22.855
[Harris sighs]
- That's it, mate.

40:22.985 --> 40:24.944
You've got no chance now.

40:29.252 --> 40:32.038

[suspenseful music]

41:28.268 --> 41:31.271

41:33.621 --> 41:34.840

41:34.970 --> 41:36.624

43:08.542 --> 43:09.369
- Oi!

43:09.499 --> 43:11.023
[suspenseful music]

43:11.153 --> 43:11.937
- Mr Harris!

43:12.067 --> 43:13.068
- Don't you "Mr Harris" me!

43:13.199 --> 43:14.504
- I'm really sorry, sir.

43:14.635 --> 43:16.332
I thought you was an enemy.

43:16.463 --> 43:17.769
- I bet you did!

43:17.899 --> 43:20.641
[dramatic music]

43:26.299 --> 43:28.780
- Really, sir, there's
no need for the pistol.

43:28.910 --> 43:30.608
- I'll be the judge of that,
Singh.

43:30.738 --> 43:32.044
What are you up to?

43:32.174 --> 43:33.480
- Up to?

43:33.611 --> 43:35.743
- I saw you nick that
compass out of Pike's bag

43:35.874 --> 43:38.224
and you know without
that we're all screwed.

43:38.354 --> 43:39.442
So what are you up to?

43:40.879 --> 43:42.663
[suspenseful music]

43:42.794 --> 43:45.492
[water splashing]
[crocodile growling]

43:45.623 --> 43:47.363
- Please, Mr Harris, sir.

43:47.494 --> 43:49.539
I insist you lower the gun.

43:49.670 --> 43:51.454
- You insist, or what?

43:51.585 --> 43:53.543
- I may be forced to take
unfortunate measures.

43:53.674 --> 43:54.370
- Oh yeah?

43:54.501 --> 43:55.763
I'd like to see that.

43:55.894 --> 43:58.505
[ominous music]

[Pike yelling desperately]

44:34.280 --> 44:37.109
[water splashing]

44:49.121 --> 44:50.122
- He's gone.

44:53.952 --> 44:54.648
- Crocodiles.

44:54.779 --> 44:57.782
[suspenseful music]

45:07.095 --> 45:10.098
[footsteps falling]

45:16.496 --> 45:19.978
[Harris sighs]
- I told him.

45:22.458 --> 45:23.503
I bleedin' told him!

45:27.681 --> 45:28.682
He was just a kid.

45:29.814 --> 45:31.076
[Harris sighs]

45:31.206 --> 45:33.121
He shouldn't have been out
here in the first place.

45:35.950 --> 45:37.517
[sighs]
Stupid kid.

45:38.997 --> 45:40.999
[sighs]

45:44.176 --> 45:46.178
- Who's gonna tell her, hey?

45:46.308 --> 45:48.223
[Harris breathes rapidly]

45:48.354 --> 45:50.835
Who's gonna turn up with
a cap in their hand.

45:51.836 --> 45:54.882
And a "Sorry Mrs. Harris,
he died too young,

45:55.927 --> 45:57.580
"but he was serving his
country."

46:00.627 --> 46:02.020
- "Mrs Harris"?

46:02.890 --> 46:03.761
- What?

46:05.023 --> 46:07.634
- Don't you mean Mrs. Pike?

46:07.765 --> 46:10.550
[dramatic music]

46:10.680 --> 46:13.292
[Harris sighs]

46:15.033 --> 46:17.296
[melancholic music]

46:17.426 --> 46:19.037
[Harris breathes deeply]
I had a little brother,

46:20.690 --> 46:21.561
Will.

46:23.563 --> 46:25.217
He was about the same age as
Pike.

46:27.306 --> 46:29.874
First in line at the town
hall to join up, he was.

46:31.571 --> 46:33.747
I had special dispensation,

46:34.574 --> 46:37.098
'cause someone had to stay at
home and look after my mum.

46:38.883 --> 46:39.884
Will couldn't wait.

46:41.668 --> 46:44.236
He thought he was going to
Germany to fight Hitler.

46:45.063 --> 46:46.325
[Harris scoffs]

46:46.455 --> 46:47.848
But he was never any
bleedin' good at geography.

46:48.893 --> 46:49.850
He ended up in Singapore.

46:49.981 --> 46:50.808
Stupid sod.

46:55.334 --> 46:57.902
He didn't know Singapore
from Streatham High Street.

46:59.947 --> 47:02.080
He just thought it was
gonna be this big adventure.

47:04.082 --> 47:05.431
Even sent us a letter home.

47:07.433 --> 47:09.609
Saying there was nothing to do.

47:09.739 --> 47:12.046
Him and the boys were just
lying around in their bunks

47:12.177 --> 47:13.961
trying to avoid the sun.

47:14.092 --> 47:16.921
[nostalgic music]

47:19.706 --> 47:20.620
And then we heard

47:22.578 --> 47:23.841
the Japanese had attacked.

47:24.754 --> 47:27.627
[dramatic music]

47:30.543 --> 47:32.458
We never had any more letters
after that.

47:32.588 --> 47:35.374
[nostalgic music]

47:35.504 --> 47:38.551
[birdsong ringing]

47:38.681 --> 47:39.726
Months went by,

47:41.467 --> 47:43.164
and then there was a knock on
the door.

47:44.209 --> 47:46.733
Some Sergeant Major or other.

47:46.864 --> 47:51.303
We knew it was bad because
he had his cap in his hand.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.090
And with him was this
tiny scrap of a bloke.

47:58.049 --> 47:59.093
All skin and bone.

48:03.489 --> 48:06.927
Well anyway, this bloke
introduced himself.

48:08.494 --> 48:09.756
[Harris sighing]

48:09.887 --> 48:11.062
Turns out he was fighting
alongside our Will.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.501
When they got captured by the
Japs,

48:17.372 --> 48:21.333
they ended up in some prisoner
of war camp in Thailand.

48:27.687 --> 48:28.949
You should've heard the things

48:29.080 --> 48:33.519
they did to my little
brother. [inhales sharply]

48:34.389 --> 48:35.695
I wish my mum hadn't have
been in the same room

48:35.825 --> 48:37.218
and heard all that.

48:37.349 --> 48:41.657
[mellow instrumental music]

48:41.788 --> 48:45.183
This bloke, he made it out
alive, barely.

48:48.926 --> 48:50.231
And Will didn't.

48:55.019 --> 48:56.063
The next day

48:57.021 --> 48:59.110
I packed my mum off to
live with her sister

49:00.067 --> 49:01.242
then I signed up.

49:03.375 --> 49:06.465
And now, here we are.

49:08.467 --> 49:10.251
We've still got a mission to
finish.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.386
And you know what?

49:14.516 --> 49:16.083
We're gonna finish this mission.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.391
For Pike.

49:21.610 --> 49:22.611
For the Sarge.

49:24.396 --> 49:26.137
And I don't care what you're up
to.

49:28.313 --> 49:29.923
We're gonna find that ammo dump

49:31.142 --> 49:32.926
and we're gonna blow the fucker
up.

49:34.754 --> 49:37.887
If we made it out of that
crocodile-infested swamp,

49:38.018 --> 49:39.063
we can do anything.

49:42.196 --> 49:43.241
[eerie music]

49:43.371 --> 49:44.242
- Um,

49:47.071 --> 49:47.985
actually

49:51.901 --> 49:55.993
the reason I took the compass
and went out walking earlier,

49:56.123 --> 49:58.647
was so I could try to
ascertain our position

49:58.778 --> 50:00.823
and plan our route eastward.

50:02.564 --> 50:03.435
- And?

50:04.784 --> 50:07.134
- To the east there's just more
swamp.

50:08.657 --> 50:10.094
- How about north?

50:10.224 --> 50:11.051
- More swamp.

50:11.878 --> 50:13.271
- South?

50:13.401 --> 50:14.272
- Swamp.

50:17.536 --> 50:19.059
- Are you telling me-

50:19.190 --> 50:23.020
- I'm sorry to say we're
not out of the swamp.

50:23.150 --> 50:25.848
We're on an island in
the middle of the swamp.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.985
[dramatic music]

50:34.118 --> 50:39.123
[haunting music]
[birds calling]

50:45.781 --> 50:48.915
[crocodile growling]

51:04.148 --> 51:06.933
I didn't know about your
brother.

51:10.154 --> 51:14.375
But now I can understand
why you hate them so much.

51:15.811 --> 51:16.899
The Japanese.

51:17.813 --> 51:20.947
[crocodile growling]

51:23.602 --> 51:28.563
But I was wondering, what
if that body we saw earlier,

51:28.694 --> 51:33.699
of that Japanese man, he
had a brother in Japan?

51:34.874 --> 51:38.443
Or a mother waiting for
her son to come back home?

51:38.573 --> 51:41.533
- Yeah, well they started it,
didn't they?

51:41.663 --> 51:45.754
I mean, look, Singapore and Hong
Kong.

51:45.885 --> 51:47.104
It's British territory.

51:48.235 --> 51:50.716
We had the right to be
there and they didn't.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.893
- It wasn't always British
territory, sir.

51:54.023 --> 51:55.938
- Well, we invaded it first.

52:03.120 --> 52:03.990
Look!

52:07.428 --> 52:08.255
What's that?

52:09.430 --> 52:10.736
- It's Pike's backpack!

52:10.866 --> 52:12.477
- No it's not.

52:12.607 --> 52:14.653
There's a map sticking out the
top.

52:14.783 --> 52:15.915
It's Sarge's.

52:17.046 --> 52:19.397
- If only we could get that map-

52:19.527 --> 52:22.095
- We'd have a bleedin'
chance to get out of here.

52:22.226 --> 52:25.054
[dramatic music]

52:26.752 --> 52:27.666
What do you think?

52:30.277 --> 52:32.453
- What do I think of what?

52:32.584 --> 52:33.759
- Getting the backpack?

52:37.980 --> 52:40.026
- Let's not be too hasty.

52:40.157 --> 52:42.463
- Come on, it's not that far
out.

52:42.594 --> 52:45.901
- Perhaps, with you
being the senior officer,

52:46.032 --> 52:48.165
it will be a privilege
for you to carry out

52:49.296 --> 52:50.471
such a heroic act?

52:50.602 --> 52:51.646
- Don't give me that.

52:51.777 --> 52:52.560
I thought you were the senior
officer?

52:52.691 --> 52:55.128
- It's very complicated, yaar.

52:55.259 --> 52:57.261
There's too many ranks.

52:57.391 --> 52:58.610
- Look, I've got an idea.

52:59.698 --> 53:00.829
Let's go fishing.

[crickets chirping]

53:12.450 --> 53:14.321
Good thing you got those
extra bootlaces in your pack.

53:15.453 --> 53:16.671
- Do you think it will hold?

53:16.802 --> 53:18.064
- Why not?

53:18.195 --> 53:20.327
You haven't got to lift the pack
up.

53:20.458 --> 53:22.286
Just hook it, pull it in.

53:23.243 --> 53:25.158
[ominous music]

53:25.289 --> 53:27.334
- Who's going to hold it?

53:27.465 --> 53:28.335
- Well,

53:29.249 --> 53:30.990
you've been fishing in a swamp
before.

53:31.120 --> 53:32.165
[dramatic music]

53:32.296 --> 53:33.297
- How excellent of you to
remember!

[suspenseful music]

53:45.134 --> 53:47.746
[Singh grunts]

53:49.704 --> 53:50.705
- It's not long enough!

53:50.836 --> 53:52.359
- Ah, just go in a bit!

53:52.490 --> 53:54.274
- It still won't be long enough!

53:54.405 --> 53:56.145
- It will be if you go far
enough.

53:59.671 --> 54:00.889
Don't worry about it.

54:01.020 --> 54:03.849
I'll keep an eye out for the
crocodiles.

54:03.979 --> 54:05.024
- Are you sure?

54:05.154 --> 54:06.199
- Just get on with it.

54:06.330 --> 54:07.940
You'll be in and out in two
minutes.

54:15.077 --> 54:17.950

54:21.693 --> 54:24.391

[birds calling]

55:09.828 --> 55:10.698
Harris!

55:11.830 --> 55:13.397
It's looking at me!

55:14.615 --> 55:17.183
What should I do?
[crocodile growls]

55:17.314 --> 55:18.793
- Well, I thought you
knew about these things!

55:18.924 --> 55:20.142
- I'm struggling to remember

55:20.273 --> 55:21.927
the finer details at this
moment!

55:22.884 --> 55:24.103
- How good can they see?

55:25.409 --> 55:26.627
Maybe you should stay still.

55:26.758 --> 55:29.413
[ominous music]

55:29.543 --> 55:32.329
- I'm leaning more towards
running away!

55:34.113 --> 55:35.636
- Christ!
- What?

55:35.767 --> 55:38.160
- There's another one!

Do they hunt in packs?

55:40.902 --> 55:42.208
- I don't know!

55:44.645 --> 55:47.169
[crocodile rumbling]

55:47.300 --> 55:48.170
- They're coming!

55:50.216 --> 55:51.086
Get out!

55:52.087 --> 55:54.786
[Singh shrieks]

55:58.616 --> 56:01.401
[Singh panting]

56:01.532 --> 56:03.795
You could've kept hold of the
pole!

56:03.925 --> 56:05.187
- I'm really sorry, sir.

56:05.318 --> 56:07.973
I didn't think it was
a priority at the time.

56:08.103 --> 56:09.844
- I mean, they've gone.

56:09.975 --> 56:10.802
Want to try again?

56:10.932 --> 56:12.151
[Singh whimpers]

56:12.281 --> 56:15.067
Oh, come on, look, just
down there, in and out.

56:15.197 --> 56:16.982
I'll keep an eye this time, I
promise.

56:17.112 --> 56:18.679
- No, no, it's not that.

56:20.377 --> 56:24.555
Every time we go into the water
we attract their attention.

56:24.685 --> 56:27.819
And then we come running
back to the land for safety.

56:27.949 --> 56:32.519
What if they grow bold enough
and decide to follow us?

56:32.650 --> 56:33.999
- [Harris] Can they do that?

56:34.129 --> 56:35.174
- They're not like fish, you
know, sir.

56:35.304 --> 56:37.002
They have legs!

56:40.135 --> 56:42.877
- Well without that map, we
don't know which way to go

56:43.008 --> 56:44.139
to get off this bleedin' island.

56:44.270 --> 56:45.314
- I understand, sir.

56:46.359 --> 56:48.317
It's a conundrum indeed.

56:48.448 --> 56:51.146
[birds singing]

56:59.154 --> 57:00.373
- It's been a few hours.

57:02.636 --> 57:04.377
I haven't seen a single
crocodile.

57:07.075 --> 57:08.990
It's like we imagined the whole
thing.

57:10.122 --> 57:10.949
[exasperated sigh]

57:11.079 --> 57:12.733
I swear there were loads of 'em.

57:12.864 --> 57:14.735
And now there's not one.

57:17.172 --> 57:18.913
Maybe they've swam off somewhere
else?

57:19.044 --> 57:22.003
Like birds, when they all fly
off at once.

57:22.134 --> 57:24.876
- Are you suggesting crocodiles
migrate?

57:25.006 --> 57:27.705
- I don't mean they've
gone south for the winter.

57:27.835 --> 57:29.489
Maybe they've just gone for a
swim.

57:35.408 --> 57:38.063
[leaves rustling]

57:38.193 --> 57:40.108
[stone plonks in water]

57:40.239 --> 57:41.762
[ominous music]

57:41.893 --> 57:42.589
- [Singh] Look!

57:42.720 --> 57:45.723
[suspenseful music]

57:52.904 --> 57:55.646
[water sloshing]

57:55.776 --> 57:57.474
- Fucking bastard crocodiles!

58:03.088 --> 58:04.219
Look at that!

58:05.090 --> 58:08.528
They've been waiting there the
whole time.

58:11.226 --> 58:13.228
- They can hold their
breath for several hours.

58:13.359 --> 58:14.665
- Are you the expert again?

58:15.666 --> 58:17.494
- No, it was just an
observation.

58:20.627 --> 58:24.326
And I also observe every
time the water splashes

58:24.457 --> 58:27.416
it attracts their
attention, just as I feared.

58:32.117 --> 58:33.510
- Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

58:37.426 --> 58:39.211
- What are you thinking?

58:41.474 --> 58:42.780
- I'm thinking

58:42.910 --> 58:44.695
if something was splashing
the water over there,

58:46.087 --> 58:48.089
that might attract their
attention long enough

58:48.220 --> 58:50.439
for someone else to go
and get the backpack.

58:53.878 --> 58:56.794
- It seems like a risky plan at
both ends.

58:59.231 --> 59:00.537
- You got any better ideas?

59:08.588 --> 59:10.372
[stones clattering]

59:10.503 --> 59:11.939
- I believe it's your turn

59:12.070 --> 59:13.854
to go into the water, Mr Harris,
sir?

59:13.985 --> 59:14.942
- Yeah, whatever.

59:16.422 --> 59:17.292
Tell you what.

59:18.555 --> 59:21.601
Let's drop all this, "Mr
Harris," and "Sir," bollocks.

59:23.472 --> 59:24.343
My name's Jack.

59:25.692 --> 59:26.998
- Very good, Jack.

59:28.869 --> 59:31.655
Pleased to make your
acquaintance.

59:31.785 --> 59:35.310
My name is
Harinariyan-Shera-Punjab-Singh-

59:35.441 --> 59:37.312
Lal-Killa-Chandni-Chowk-Delhi-Va
la.

59:37.443 --> 59:38.183
- Oh, forget it.

59:38.313 --> 59:39.488
- "Harry," for short.

59:40.664 --> 59:41.926
- Yeah, all right.

59:42.056 --> 59:43.841
That's enough time-wasting.

59:43.971 --> 59:45.582
You best get chucking some rocks
in there,

59:45.712 --> 59:47.496
see if it's gonna work.

59:47.627 --> 59:48.672
- Yes Jack!

59:51.283 --> 59:52.327
[stones clattering]

59:52.458 --> 59:54.199
[leaves crunching underfoot]

59:54.329 --> 59:57.071
[dramatic music]

01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:06.820
[water splashing]

01:00:16.264 --> 01:00:19.659
[water splashing]

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:21.313
[crocodile growling]

01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:22.749
Look there!

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.881
It's working.

01:00:25.926 --> 01:00:26.927
- Chuck another one!

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:29.887
- I suggest you don't shout.

01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:31.497
They may be able to hear you.

01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:35.719
[suspenseful music]

01:00:39.897 --> 01:00:42.726
[water splashing]

01:00:47.295 --> 01:00:49.167
- There's three over here.

01:00:49.297 --> 01:00:50.734
This may be your best chance.

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:53.040
- Yeah, in a minute.

01:00:57.566 --> 01:00:59.612
[water splashing]

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:00.613
- Right.

01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:07.228
[water splashing]

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:13.931
[water sloshing]

01:01:15.497 --> 01:01:18.370

[crocodile growling]

01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:36.518
[dramatic orchestral music]

01:01:44.439 --> 01:01:47.268
[water sloshing]

01:01:52.099 --> 01:01:54.536
- Hey! Crocodiles, over here!

01:01:55.494 --> 01:01:57.452
- He's gone bleedin' mad.

01:01:57.583 --> 01:02:00.673
[crocodile growling]

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:09.682
[music crescendos]

01:02:09.813 --> 01:02:10.857
- [Harris] I've got it!

01:02:10.988 --> 01:02:13.555
- Oh, thank God for that!

01:02:13.686 --> 01:02:15.209
[leaves crunching]

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.343
I can't see where the bloody
crocodiles are anyway.

01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:23.348
[crocodiles splashing in water]

01:02:23.478 --> 01:02:24.262
[Singh screams]

01:02:24.392 --> 01:02:25.176
- Harry!

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:28.005
[Singh screams]

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:38.015
[crocodile splashing]

01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:42.019
- You, you saved my life, Jack.

01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:43.194
- Oh, shut it!

01:02:43.324 --> 01:02:45.065
It's just a scratch.

01:02:45.196 --> 01:02:47.415
[Harris panting]

01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:50.592
- It would have dragged
me in just like Pike.

01:02:50.723 --> 01:02:53.552
[Harris gasping]

01:02:54.379 --> 01:02:56.381
- Come on, we've gotta keep
moving.

01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.688
That sun's going down and I'd
rather

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:01.690
spend the night away from that
water.

01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:05.912
- I don't think I can get up,
Jack.

01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:07.479
- Yes you can!

01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:09.046
It's not that far.

01:03:09.176 --> 01:03:11.875
And when we get there I'll light
a fire

01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:13.354
and that'll keep them away.

01:03:13.485 --> 01:03:15.922
[crocodile growling]

01:03:16.053 --> 01:03:17.271
- Or bring them nearer.

01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:22.059
[Singh whimpers]

01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:23.930
[Harris panting]

01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:27.151
[crocodile rumbling]

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:39.206
[fire crackling]

01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:45.517
[night creatures chattering]

01:03:45.647 --> 01:03:48.694
[crickets chirping]

01:03:52.219 --> 01:03:54.831
[Singh grunts]

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.704
- How's the leg?

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:01.576
- Not better, not worse.

01:04:01.707 --> 01:04:03.187
- That's good.

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:06.277
Be alright in the morning
when you've had a bit of kip.

01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:08.932
[Singh grunts]

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:15.199
- Tell me something, Jack.

01:04:16.156 --> 01:04:18.376
There's something I don't
understand.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.291
- What?

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.424
- It really surprised me.

01:04:23.555 --> 01:04:25.774
Your reaction to what happened
to,

01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:27.124
to young Pike.

01:04:30.475 --> 01:04:32.564
I can understand your
explanation,

01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:37.134
but I never imaged your
saw him like a brother

01:04:37.264 --> 01:04:39.963
because you never had a
kind word to say to him.

01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:42.139
- Kind word?

01:04:43.575 --> 01:04:47.231
- What I mean is, you would
always make jokes about him,

01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:48.754
or have a laugh at his expense.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:49.755
- Oh, that.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.803
Listen, Harry, you wouldn't
understand.

01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:57.154
It's a British thing.

01:04:57.284 --> 01:04:58.372
It's what we do.

01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:00.113
- A British thing?

01:05:00.244 --> 01:05:01.680
It's called, "Taking the piss."

01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:03.421
Having a laugh.

01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:04.335
A bit of banter.

01:05:04.465 --> 01:05:05.336
That's all.

01:05:06.206 --> 01:05:07.555
- Banter?

01:05:07.686 --> 01:05:09.993
- It's how you know who your
mates are.

01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:12.952
When you can have a bit of
banter.

01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:16.303
It's like a show of affection I
suppose.

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:20.394
- Oh, I see.

01:05:20.525 --> 01:05:23.920
Now I understand why
you used to shout at me

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:26.574
and accuse me of doing certain
things.

01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:30.143
Because you felt I was
like a brother to you!

01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:31.101
- No!

01:05:36.323 --> 01:05:37.194
I, um...

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.849
[Harris sighs]
Yeah, that was it.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.852
I should've known you wouldn't
understand.

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.901
- It's okay, I get it now.

01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:50.294
You bloody stupid English idiot!

01:05:50.424 --> 01:05:52.035
- Oi! Watch it!

01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:55.212
There are ways of doing it.

01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:02.349
[Singh grunts]

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.178
[dramatic music]

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:07.964
[birds calling]

01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:38.429
- Fuck me!

01:06:39.647 --> 01:06:40.387
- What is it?

01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:41.345
- Look at this!

01:06:42.563 --> 01:06:43.564
[Singh yawns]

01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:45.436
That's the route we were meant
to take!

01:06:47.394 --> 01:06:49.788
The Sarge marked on there
where we turned east

01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:50.789
into the swamp.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.010
That is the route we were meant
to take.

01:06:55.272 --> 01:06:57.361
And if you follow a straight
line east

01:06:57.491 --> 01:06:59.754
there's a tiny little island

01:06:59.885 --> 01:07:01.104
and that's where we are.

01:07:02.453 --> 01:07:04.020
And if you go further east

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.631
there's that bleedin' Japanese
base.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.069
It's less than half a mile away
from here.

01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:12.028
We're nearly there.

01:07:17.816 --> 01:07:20.993
If they've got any lights we'll
be able to see it from here.

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.081
- Which way's east?

01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:24.214
- I don't know.

01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:26.651
- Can't you tell from
the stars, or something?

01:07:26.781 --> 01:07:29.828
- My eyes are a little blurry.

01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:30.655
- Oh forget it.

01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:31.656
Where's the compass?

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:36.095
- Uh, it was here in the
morning.

01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:37.923
- So what happened to it?

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.359
- It was in my hand!

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:40.317
- [Harris] When?

01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:43.972
- When we were fighting.

01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:46.018
- Are you bleedin' kidding me?

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:48.281
After what we went
through to get that map?

01:07:49.326 --> 01:07:51.154
We were that close!

01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:53.982
[birds calling]

01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:59.640
- I'm really sorry to say,

01:08:01.686 --> 01:08:04.297
I'm not going to be able
to make it that far anyway.

01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:06.778
Not through the water

01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:08.867
with this leg.

01:08:13.393 --> 01:08:16.962
[leaves crunching underfoot]

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:21.314
- Listen, Harry, I tell you
what.

01:08:23.707 --> 01:08:28.321
You wait here and tomorrow
I'll go back to where we first

01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:29.627
came out of that water.

01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:33.457
[Harris sighs]

01:08:33.587 --> 01:08:35.111
I'll make a straight line east

01:08:36.502 --> 01:08:37.721
and I'll find that base.

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:40.986
And then I'll find the munitions
dump

01:08:42.335 --> 01:08:43.075
[Harris sighs]

01:08:43.206 --> 01:08:44.076
and I'll blow the fucker up

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.513
with a couple of them grenades.

01:08:50.604 --> 01:08:51.953
- And then what?

01:08:52.953 --> 01:08:55.218
[Harris sighs]
And then while I'm gone

01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:59.046
you find some sticks, build a
raft.

01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:01.484
- This nice, big raft.

01:09:02.354 --> 01:09:05.792
And then we can float out of
the swamp to the getaway boat.

01:09:06.837 --> 01:09:09.841
And then we'll be back
in Singapore for supper.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:10.885
How's that sound?

01:09:18.023 --> 01:09:21.374
- I really appreciate your
optimism, Jack.

01:09:21.505 --> 01:09:23.376
But you have to be realistic.

01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:28.990
The description of these
events is very unlikely.

01:09:30.035 --> 01:09:31.602
- We gotta try and do something!

01:09:32.645 --> 01:09:34.953
Otherwise this has all
been a waste of time.

01:09:35.082 --> 01:09:39.000
The Sarge, Pike, all for what?

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:44.397
And I'll tell you one thing,

01:09:45.616 --> 01:09:47.051
I'm not quitting.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.053
Not now.

01:09:48.966 --> 01:09:50.273
We've come too fucking far.

01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:54.625
[ominous music]

01:09:54.755 --> 01:09:57.845
[crocodile growling]

01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:12.469
- I was in this situation once
before.

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:18.388
- Five Rupees?

01:10:18.518 --> 01:10:20.694
What's this? Indian money?

01:10:20.825 --> 01:10:22.043
- No, look at it.

01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:24.176
"Japanese Government".

01:10:26.613 --> 01:10:29.529
When the Japanese invaded Burma,

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.401
they imposed their own currency.

01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:33.403
I was fighting out there.

01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:38.321
I found this and decided
to keep it as a souvenir.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.019
- That's the bleedin'
Japanese for you, innit?

01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:42.325
[Harris sniggers]

01:10:42.455 --> 01:10:44.501
It's their way of showing you
who's boss.

01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:46.981
"We're running the bleedin'
country now, mate".

01:10:48.418 --> 01:10:50.071
- You're probably right.

01:10:50.202 --> 01:10:51.334
- Bloody Japs.

01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:54.511
- But it was the same in 1835

01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:57.035
when the British imposed
the Indian Coinage Act.

01:10:58.166 --> 01:11:00.908
They said that all the Indian
currency

01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:03.694
will have to bear the face
of the King of England.

01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:04.782
- Well that was different.

01:11:04.912 --> 01:11:06.523
We weren't at war then.

01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.742
Anyway, India was a bloody mess

01:11:08.873 --> 01:11:10.657
before we came in and sorted it
out.

01:11:11.963 --> 01:11:15.140
- Perhaps that it what Mr
Hitler thought of Poland?

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.141
- You what?

01:11:17.098 --> 01:11:19.275
- Please don't misunderstand me,
Jack.

01:11:19.405 --> 01:11:23.888
As you know, my family
business benefited hugely

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:25.803
by trading with the British
Empire.

01:11:27.326 --> 01:11:29.372
It was my father who encouraged
me

01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:31.461
to join the Volunteer Army.

01:11:31.591 --> 01:11:34.028
He said we owed the British a
huge debt.

01:11:37.684 --> 01:11:39.686
- What were you doing in Burma?

01:11:39.817 --> 01:11:42.428
- They called it, "Operation
Longcloth."

01:11:42.559 --> 01:11:45.170
- You were on Operation
Longcloth?

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.345
- You've heard of it?

01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:47.651
- Of course.

01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:49.305
It was all in the papers.

01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:53.613
Major General Wingate going on
about what a success it was.

01:11:53.744 --> 01:11:55.702
- Huh! It was terrible.

01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:00.925
We were amongst the first in.

01:12:02.535 --> 01:12:05.277
"Long-range penetration," they
called it.

01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:10.587
We were ordered to cross
the Irrawaddy River,

01:12:10.717 --> 01:12:12.023
deep into Burma.

01:12:13.807 --> 01:12:15.983
Our column was the first to
cross it

01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:19.291
and then we decided to sit
and wait for the others.

01:12:21.075 --> 01:12:23.556
But then the orders changed.

01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:25.602
Wingate was ordered to withdraw.

01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:30.737
We were left stranded on
the wrong side of the river

01:12:30.868 --> 01:12:34.611
with limited supplies and
the Japanese hunting us down.

01:12:37.222 --> 01:12:40.051
We were deep into enemy
territory,

01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:43.794
just like you and I are now.

01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:47.972
- Then what happened?

01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:52.237
- We had to abandon all our
equipment.

01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:55.980
And once the supplies ran out,

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:59.462
we were instructed to eat our
horses.

01:13:02.595 --> 01:13:03.727
I refused.

01:13:05.032 --> 01:13:09.297
Eventually, I used that
horse to cross the river.

01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:14.999
I made it, but a lot of them
didn't.

01:13:16.348 --> 01:13:21.309
I believe we lost a thousand men
over all.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.964
- Christ, they didn't
print that in the papers.

01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:26.793
[birds calling]

01:13:29.187 --> 01:13:30.318
- You keep it.

01:13:31.319 --> 01:13:32.886
- It's your souvenir.

01:13:33.017 --> 01:13:35.889
- I believe you have a
slightly better chance than me

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.717
of making it off this island.

01:13:44.507 --> 01:13:45.943
- I've got something in here for
you.

01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:50.513
Try that.

01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:53.341
- What is that?

01:13:53.472 --> 01:13:54.430
- American gum.

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.171
You ever tried it before?

01:13:58.085 --> 01:14:00.261
- I don't believe I've
ever had the pleasure.

01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:03.569
- There you go.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.484
- Are you sure, Jack?

01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:06.442
- Of course.

01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.053
- Thank you very much.

01:14:18.976 --> 01:14:22.893
- Mm, very unusual flavor.

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:27.419
- Did you just swallow it?

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.639
- Yes, very, very tasty.

01:14:29.769 --> 01:14:31.467
- You're not meant to swallow
it!

01:14:32.772 --> 01:14:34.295
I wanted that back!

01:14:34.426 --> 01:14:36.080
I could've made that last a
week!

01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:46.525
- What's that?
[dramatic music]

01:14:46.656 --> 01:14:51.399
[Harris panting]
- There's something out there!

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:52.792
- A Japanese patrol!

01:14:52.923 --> 01:14:53.880
[crocodile growling softly]

01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:55.316
- I doubt it.

01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:56.796
One thing I'll say about the
Japanese,

01:14:56.927 --> 01:14:59.320
is they ain't stupid.

01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:00.539
And they're not gonna go
marching

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.323
into a swamp full of bloody
crocodiles.

01:15:03.934 --> 01:15:04.891
Not like we did.

01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:08.504
[dramatic music]

01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:12.072
- What if they did?

01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:13.117
- You what?

01:15:14.422 --> 01:15:18.470
- I never finished telling
you about Operation Longcloth.

01:15:18.601 --> 01:15:19.819
- Well you'd better hurry up.

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:21.212
I think we've got company.

01:15:22.953 --> 01:15:26.652
- It was a horrible failure,
but there was one positive.

01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:32.266
The Japanese sent out three
whole divisions to hunt us down.

01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:35.748
That left them very short of
men,

01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:38.446
so when they attempted to invade
India

01:15:38.577 --> 01:15:39.883
they miserably failed.

01:15:41.014 --> 01:15:42.886
- Shit! There's one of them!

01:15:43.016 --> 01:15:44.670
I think we're in trouble, mate.

01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:45.889
- Are you listening to me, Jack?

01:15:46.019 --> 01:15:48.239
- Yeah, we beat 'em out of
India.

01:15:48.369 --> 01:15:51.808
- What are you getting at?

01:15:51.938 --> 01:15:55.725
- Well, sometimes you can fail
and still make a difference.

01:15:56.856 --> 01:15:59.163
Oh Christ, there's another one!

01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:00.947
- Listen to me, Jack!

01:16:01.078 --> 01:16:03.820
We agreed if the Japanese hear a
gun

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.518
they will send a patrol to
investigate.

01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:09.739
But what if they hear
a few of these go off?

01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:14.395
They will think they're under
attack

01:16:14.526 --> 01:16:18.269
and they might just send
out a whole division!

01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:21.533
- Into a swamp full of
crocodiles?

01:16:21.664 --> 01:16:23.143
That'd be a bleedin' massacre.

01:16:23.274 --> 01:16:24.144
- Right!

01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:28.801
[victorious instrumental music]

01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:32.326
- If I have to go down,
I'm going down fighting.

01:16:32.457 --> 01:16:35.155
And if I can take out a whole
division of Japs with me,

01:16:35.286 --> 01:16:36.243
that's even better.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.681
Give me the bag.

01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:41.684
- [Singh] Look out!

01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:43.381
[gunshots ringing]

01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:44.600
- There's another one!

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:47.907
[gunshots ringing]

01:16:48.038 --> 01:16:48.734
I knew it!

01:16:48.865 --> 01:16:50.040
I knew they'd come.

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:51.868
- They've got a taste
for us now, ain't they?

01:16:54.218 --> 01:16:55.132
I wonder if they like Japanese
meat

01:16:55.262 --> 01:16:56.437
like they like the English?

01:16:56.568 --> 01:16:58.788
- They seem to like a
bit of Indian all right.

01:17:01.007 --> 01:17:03.140
Look out, it's coming back!

01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:04.054
- Well it ain't gonna come back

01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:05.577
when he gets a taste of this.

01:17:10.321 --> 01:17:11.627
[Harris grunts]

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:16.588
You hear that you bloody Japs?

01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:18.721
There's more where that came
from.

01:17:18.851 --> 01:17:20.984
Come and get us if you've got
the guts.

01:17:21.114 --> 01:17:22.420
[crocodile growling]
- Look out!

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:23.464

[gunshots ringing]

01:17:29.819 --> 01:17:31.908
- Jack! Throw me the bag!

01:17:33.997 --> 01:17:34.824
The strap!

01:17:38.392 --> 01:17:39.480
I've got you!

01:17:47.358 --> 01:17:49.186
- Let go you idiot!

01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:51.928
Or else it'll take you as well!

01:17:52.058 --> 01:17:53.190
- Shut up!

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.452
I've got you!

Jack Harris, you bloody
stupid English idiot.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:46.634
