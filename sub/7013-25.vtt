WEBVTT

00:10.377 --> 00:14.473
Ah, my last American Popsicle
washed down by my last American grape soda.

00:15.548 --> 00:18.449
Fez, it's sad
you're getting deported...

00:18.518 --> 00:21.510
but this "last American" crap's
getting annoying.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.182
Ah, my last American chance
to annoy you.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.954
Hey. Come on, Fez.
Look on the bright side.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.962
I mean, we graduate tomorrow.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.293
You go to your country
with a high school diploma...

00:32.365 --> 00:35.129
they'll probably make you, like,
head medicine man or something.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.831
Eric, there is no bright side
about going back to a place...

00:39.906 --> 00:42.067
where people
are outnumbered by lizards.

00:44.544 --> 00:49.277
I'm gonna miss you, man.
When you get there, can you mail me a lizard?

00:49.349 --> 00:52.216
- Eric, guess what came for you?
- Hey. They just send those to me.

00:52.285 --> 00:55.015
I don't even find
those girls attractive.

00:55.088 --> 00:58.387
No, you perv. It's the key
to our new apartment in Madison.

00:58.458 --> 01:01.052
- Oh.
- Now we can leave tomorrow after
graduation like we wanted.

01:01.127 --> 01:03.618
Great. By this time next week,
our new neighbors will be...

01:03.696 --> 01:06.961
hearing your cries of love
through our paper-thin walls.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.934
Cries of love?
Or cries of disappointment?

01:10.937 --> 01:12.928
Oh, I don't want to go.

01:13.006 --> 01:15.566
Come on, Fez. It's not like we're never
gonna see you again.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.667
I'm sure in a couple months
you'll be, like...

01:17.744 --> 01:20.110
on the cover of <i>National Geographic.</i>

01:23.183 --> 01:26.050
Yeah, those bastards
are always so intrusive.

01:28.321 --> 01:30.846
Fez, look.
At least we're going camping tonight.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.893
- We'll all be together for our last blowout.
- It won't be all of us.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.088
Kelso can't make it on account
of he's got a broken face.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.597
I don't got a broken face.

01:42.669 --> 01:45.069
You will if you keep interfering with me
getting Jackie back.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.470
You're the one that's interfering.

01:47.540 --> 01:51.237
You know what? I'm going and Jackie's going,
and you're staying home.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.472
- No. You are.
- No. You are.

01:53.546 --> 01:56.037
- Fine, stay home then.
- I will.

01:59.452 --> 02:03.388
Hey, stop it. Would you please put aside
your differences and go camping with me?

02:03.456 --> 02:06.016
We only have
a few hours left together.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.491
- Fine. I'll go for you.
- Good.

02:08.561 --> 02:12.691
Now, I am off to spend the rest of my
American money on candy and porno.

02:13.766 --> 02:17.202
- But, Fez-
- I said, candy and porno.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.379 --> 02:29.940
Hey, Jackie? You're gonna love
these cookies on the camping trip.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.507
They're sweet and tasty,
just like me.

02:34.521 --> 02:37.046
Kelso, this apple's
kind of like you too.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.886
You mean juicy and delicious?

02:39.959 --> 02:42.450
- No. Red and bruised.
- Agh!

02:43.730 --> 02:46.460
Yeah? Well, these hot dogs
are like you, too, Hyde.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.991
They're, uh-

02:50.069 --> 02:52.401
- Kosher.
- Yeah, kosher!

02:54.908 --> 02:56.876
- Wait, what's kosher?
- That means blessed by a rabbi.

02:56.943 --> 02:59.138
Burn!

03:00.813 --> 03:03.008
Jackie, are you sure
you want to go camping?

03:03.082 --> 03:05.516
These idiots are gonna be competing
over you the whole time.

03:05.585 --> 03:08.554
Well, I am glad, Donna.
They've both jerked me around so much...

03:08.621 --> 03:10.612
I cannot wait
to watch 'em fight over me.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.023
You know, if you really want to mess
with them, you should do it with me.

03:16.062 --> 03:18.428
Hey, talk about humiliating.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.801
So, you guys are going
to the lake, huh?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.803
It is real fun up there.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.930
My senior year, I set the record...

03:27.006 --> 03:30.373
for most topless rides
on the rope swing.

03:31.844 --> 03:33.778
I wish I was goin'.

03:33.846 --> 03:36.406
Yeah, don't even
think about it, Laurie.

03:36.482 --> 03:39.042
There are enough scary things
in the woods already.

03:39.118 --> 03:42.679
Eric, I'm being deported,
and she's loose with the boobs. She goes.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.159
Hey, Forman. Your mom just came back
from the loony doctor.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.287
She got real depressed when she heard
you guys were moving to Madison, huh?

03:50.363 --> 03:52.661
Yeah, you're tellin' me.
Last night she was making sounds...

03:52.732 --> 03:54.666
that were giving my dad
war flashbacks.

03:57.337 --> 04:00.898
What a beautiful day.

04:02.442 --> 04:06.640
I feel- I feel like a rainbow.

04:07.647 --> 04:12.175
Anyone else feel like a rainbow?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.688
- What happened to her?
- [Pills Rattling]

04:21.027 --> 04:23.518
## [Singing Folk Rock]

04:55.328 --> 04:57.353
## [Ends]

04:59.399 --> 05:01.333
I wrote that just for you, Jackie.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.869
He didn't write that.
He ripped it off from "American Pie."

05:03.936 --> 05:07.030
Nah-uh.
The "American Pie" guy ripped me off.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.768
- You shut up, man.
- You shut up!

05:09.842 --> 05:13.744
Okay. I'm gonna freak everyone out
and tell my ghost story...

05:13.813 --> 05:16.873
so go hide in the woods
and jump out when I get to the end.

05:16.949 --> 05:19.747
[British Accent]
You are as wicked as you are gorgeous.

05:22.021 --> 05:27.084
You know, it really creeps me out being up
here after what happened to those kids.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.424
What kids?

05:30.863 --> 05:35.300
A bunch of kids just like us were
camping out up here...

05:35.368 --> 05:37.598
and they disappeared.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.504
And all the police could find were these
bloody drag marks that led down to the lake.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.633
<i>It was like-</i>

05:43.710 --> 05:46.736
It was like something killed them
and then pulled them in.

05:46.813 --> 05:49.782
Maybe it was the Loch Ness Monster.

05:51.951 --> 05:56.786
No. Fez, the Loch Ness Monster's
in Africa.

05:56.856 --> 06:00.257
So the police, like, searched the lake
with their sonar and stuff...

06:00.326 --> 06:02.260
and when they
played back the tapes...

06:02.328 --> 06:05.456
all they could hear in the background was,
like, a whisper.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.761
What did it say?

06:08.968 --> 06:12.096
"I am the Lady of the Lake.

06:12.171 --> 06:15.163
<i>I am the Lady of the Lake. "</i>

06:15.241 --> 06:19.439
Yeah. And you'll know when she's coming,
because she screams before she kills.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.810
Let's see if we can hear her.

06:27.754 --> 06:31.155
I said, let's see
if we can hear her.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.954
<i>[Eric]</i>
<i>D- Donna, I'm stuck in a thornbush.</i>

06:37.497 --> 06:40.660
I heard her.
She's stuck in a thornbush.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.903
I'm kind of cold.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.565
I'll reward who ever
gets more firewood...

06:47.640 --> 06:50.905
by letting them
feed me marshmallows.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.969
I'm not gonna go running around
the woods trying to impress you.

06:55.047 --> 06:57.709
I will.

07:00.686 --> 07:03.519
Damn it.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.853
I'm gonna go take a walk
down to the lake.

07:08.728 --> 07:11.162
[Thinking]
She's going to the lake, old boy.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.824
That means topless rope-swinging.

07:13.900 --> 07:18.701
Now, do you want to spend your last hours
in America eating s'mores?

07:18.771 --> 07:24.141
Or watching her glorious breasts
swinging in the chilly night air?

07:25.344 --> 07:27.608
I choose boobs.

07:30.550 --> 07:34.316
This is so strange, you know?
It's, like, our last night all together.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.447
It's too weird to think about.
Let's, like, do something to get our minds off it.

07:38.524 --> 07:41.891
Well, here's the tent.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.192
So, I'll tell you what. I'll go inside,
strip down and just lay there-

07:45.264 --> 07:48.825
Let's go skinny-dipping.
Meet me down by the lake in five minutes.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.699
Wait, so-

07:51.771 --> 07:55.867
I have to walk all the way down
to the lake by myself?

07:55.942 --> 07:58.911
Yeah.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.912
That's cool.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.945
Here you go, Kitty.
Home sweet home.

08:09.455 --> 08:11.821
I went into my closet
to get a jacket.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.792
I found Kitty standin' in there.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.362
I like the way
the coats felt on my arms.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.668
Oh, yes.

08:44.423 --> 08:47.358
Why, there you are,
my little sex muffin.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.188
- Little brother?
- [Screams]

08:54.901 --> 08:56.960
[Screams]

08:57.036 --> 08:59.027
<i>[Screams]</i>

08:59.105 --> 09:01.039
What the hell was that?

09:01.107 --> 09:05.476
It's the Lady of the Lake!
She screams and then she kills!

09:09.315 --> 09:11.442
[Thinking]
There's Laurie.

09:11.517 --> 09:14.179
Okay. Time to turn on the charm.

09:14.253 --> 09:18.246
Hey, Laurie, are you naked,
or you just happy to see me?

09:19.325 --> 09:23.386
- Oh, my God! Fez!
- Oh, my God! Donna!

09:23.462 --> 09:27.523
[Thinking]
Steady, old boy. Say something smooth.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.864
Nice honkers.

09:29.936 --> 09:33.702
- Get out of here!
- Hey, you like the rough stuff, eh?

09:38.044 --> 09:40.012
It was awful.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.445
I saw Laurie,
and everything just went blank.

09:42.515 --> 09:46.508
And I just ran, Donna.
I just ran away.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.453
And then I heard these
high-pitched screams.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.820
And it was me.

09:51.891 --> 09:54.860
Yeah? Well,
I've got bigger problems.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.419
Fez is a good artist.
He's gonna paint me onto a nudie poster...

09:58.497 --> 10:02.593
and sell it to every gaucho in Argentina,
or wherever the hell he's from.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.762
Eric, I'm gonna be
Ms. Nude Argentina.

10:07.673 --> 10:11.473
You know,
being here under the stars...

10:11.544 --> 10:14.172
sitting in the grass...

10:14.246 --> 10:16.544
makes me really glad I'm not poor.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.151
Man, check out that fire, baby.

10:21.220 --> 10:26.419
Yeah, if there's one thing I'm good at,
it's turning a small fire into a big fire.

10:26.492 --> 10:30.258
Man, that one
guitar-shaped log is roarin'.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.591
What the- Is that my guitar?

10:35.601 --> 10:38.661
Yep. It's got a nice, warm sound.

10:38.738 --> 10:42.640
<i>- Dead!</i>
- Back off, man. Jackie doesn't want you.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.142
Yeah? She still has
feelings for me and you know it!

10:45.211 --> 10:48.009
Okay, okay, okay. Stop it!
This isn't fun for me anymore!

10:48.080 --> 10:50.514
What?
What do you mean fun for you?

10:51.584 --> 10:53.779
I didn't say that.

10:53.853 --> 10:57.846
Yeah, you did. All right.
What are you trying to do?

10:57.923 --> 11:00.687
You're getting your kicks off of watching us
jump through hoops over you.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.751
No. We didn't jump through hoops.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.023
I'm good at that.
I would have won that.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.197
All right. I'm done with this crap, Jackie.
You choose right now. Me or him.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.670
Yeah, who's it gonna be?

11:13.739 --> 11:15.798
- Wait. What? No. L-
- What's the matter? You don't know?

11:15.875 --> 11:17.866
No, I don't know.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.143
Wow. Drama.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.555
I know. For a second there I almost forgot
about my sister's wet, naked ass.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.819
Oh, God!

11:35.828 --> 11:39.025
Yeah, where is Laurie?
And where's Fez?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.974
That was incredible, huh?

11:54.747 --> 11:56.908
It was okay.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.041
Okay's good enough for me.

12:16.582 --> 12:19.949
Wow. Yeah, I don't know
if it's the mountain air...

12:20.018 --> 12:22.077
or the poison from that thornbush...

12:22.154 --> 12:24.987
but... I slept great.

12:26.825 --> 12:28.759
Oh, my God.
It's almost 10:30.

12:28.827 --> 12:30.988
We're late for graduation.

12:59.558 --> 13:01.583
Wait, wait.
Guys?

13:01.660 --> 13:03.787
Guys, where's the van?

13:03.862 --> 13:05.796
I think it's obvious, Jackie.

13:05.864 --> 13:09.356
The Lady of the Lake stole it.

13:09.434 --> 13:13.131
- Why would a ghost need a van?
- What's she gonna do, hitch a ride?

13:14.139 --> 13:16.266
Who's gonna pick up a ghost?

13:16.341 --> 13:19.003
And you're telling me
you can't decide between us?

13:20.112 --> 13:22.603
Oh, my God.
Fez and Laurie.

13:22.681 --> 13:26.014
- They probably took it to mess with us.
- Aw, man. I'm gonna kill 'em.

13:26.084 --> 13:29.679
Eric, if I'm right about the Lady of the Lake,
and I think I am...

13:31.089 --> 13:33.080
they might already be dead.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.862
I can't believe those morons
missed their own graduation.

13:38.930 --> 13:43.162
My whole life I waited to hear
the Pinciotti name called at graduation.

13:44.336 --> 13:47.533
When they skipped
from Olendorff to Stevens...

13:47.606 --> 13:50.336
a little part of me died.

13:52.311 --> 13:54.472
Come on.
Let's get you a hoagie.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.682
Kitty.

13:58.750 --> 14:02.777
We've got to have a little conversation
about those pills you're taking.

14:02.854 --> 14:06.290
These things?
I think they're working wonders.

14:06.358 --> 14:08.758
You know, I didn't cry once
when Eric got his diploma.

14:08.827 --> 14:11.125
I just smiled and took his picture.

14:12.130 --> 14:14.064
That wasn't Eric.

14:14.132 --> 14:17.829
That was some skinny girl
with a Dorothy Hamill haircut.

14:18.904 --> 14:20.997
But it's not fair, Red.

14:21.073 --> 14:25.009
You-You teach your children how to-
how to walk, to-to use a fork...

14:25.077 --> 14:28.444
to-to look both ways
before crossing the street...

14:28.513 --> 14:31.505
and then one day you realize
all you're doing is teaching them how to leave.

14:31.583 --> 14:34.381
We should never
have potty-trained him.

14:34.453 --> 14:37.422
Listen, Kitty.
We did the kid thing...

14:37.489 --> 14:40.890
and it was... great.

14:42.461 --> 14:46.363
But now I'm looking forward
to it just being the two of us again.

14:46.431 --> 14:48.558
This is our time.

14:48.633 --> 14:50.692
Let's enjoy it.

14:55.040 --> 14:59.807
You're right, Red. I don't need those.
[Laughs]

14:59.878 --> 15:03.939
Whenever I feel like I'm on the verge of a
nervous breakdown, I'll just come talk to you.

15:05.917 --> 15:09.444
And I'll just give you one of these.

15:14.159 --> 15:16.093
Wow. What a great day.

15:16.161 --> 15:19.028
Not only did we get
to miss our own graduation...

15:19.097 --> 15:22.260
but we got to ride home
in the back of a pig truck.

15:23.635 --> 15:25.569
Yeah, when we went
around a corner...

15:25.637 --> 15:28.162
one of those pigs almost
went to third base on me.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.174
You know what?
I need a shower.

15:30.242 --> 15:32.176
Hang on.
You're not going anywhere.

15:32.244 --> 15:34.906
- You haven't given us an answer yet.
- Yeah. Who's it gonna be?

15:34.980 --> 15:38.211
You know what?
I can't talk about love right now.

15:38.283 --> 15:40.683
The bottom of my jeans have
something brown on them.

15:43.989 --> 15:48.892
- Where the hell have you been?
- I have waited 18 years for my graduation picture.

15:48.960 --> 15:53.192
I want you all back here at 5:00 sharp
in your caps and gowns, ready to say cheese.

15:53.265 --> 15:55.733
Is that clear?

15:55.801 --> 15:58.269
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Yes, Mom.

15:58.336 --> 16:03.831
Hey? What kind of a moron leaves
the keys <i>in</i> the ignition?

16:03.909 --> 16:09.438
When I put the keys in my pocket,
it distracts from my natural bulge. God!

16:21.259 --> 16:24.057
You guys, I've been thinking about Steven
and Michael all day...

16:24.129 --> 16:26.097
and I don't know who to pick.

16:26.164 --> 16:28.860
Face facts, Jackie.
There's only one good man in this town...

16:28.934 --> 16:31.095
and, well, he's leaving.

16:33.638 --> 16:35.936
Eric, this is really hard.

16:36.007 --> 16:41.843
I mean, okay. I know I love Steven
because he's smart, and he's deep...

16:41.913 --> 16:44.575
and when we have conversation
he makes me think.

16:44.649 --> 16:47.618
Which used to give me a headache,
but now I really like.

16:49.788 --> 16:54.157
- So, go with Hyde.
- Yeah, but Michael.

16:54.226 --> 16:58.856
Oh, Michael is so beautiful.

16:58.930 --> 17:02.957
And you spend a lot more time looking
at someone than you do talking to them.

17:05.270 --> 17:08.705
Again, go with Hyde.

17:08.772 --> 17:11.435
No, but, Donna,
you don't understand.

17:11.510 --> 17:14.604
Look, I know in a lot of ways
I need Steven.

17:14.679 --> 17:17.204
But Michael needs me.

17:17.281 --> 17:19.910
And it's nice to be needed.

17:19.984 --> 17:22.282
You know what, Jackie?

17:22.354 --> 17:24.515
In order to help you, and-

17:24.589 --> 17:26.750
well, just to speed
this thing up-

17:26.825 --> 17:30.386
I, uh- I think you should
just take everything and toss it aside...

17:30.462 --> 17:34.626
and ask yourself,
who do you love the most?

17:37.435 --> 17:40.404
You're right. You're right.
That's what I should do-

17:40.472 --> 17:43.339
- Because I'm-
- No, no. Not here. Not here.

17:44.943 --> 17:47.639
Yeah, that's-Yeah, just-

17:49.814 --> 17:53.272
More dishes? I
thought we already loaded these.

17:59.357 --> 18:02.326
You had to bring
the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

18:11.870 --> 18:15.567
Son, here's 10 bucks for gas.

18:17.509 --> 18:19.443
No way. Thanks.

18:19.511 --> 18:21.809
Well, I just want
to make sure that you get out.

18:23.515 --> 18:27.076
I mean, that you get, um,
all the way there.

18:28.119 --> 18:30.849
Hey, guys, I made a decision.

18:30.922 --> 18:34.858
So who's it gonna be?
"Tall and hot" or "short and kosher"?

18:38.630 --> 18:40.825
Would you shut the hell up
and let her talk?

18:40.899 --> 18:44.528
Okay, look. I had to ask myself
a really hard question.

18:44.603 --> 18:46.662
Who do I love most?

18:46.738 --> 18:50.139
And the answer was so obvious.
It was staring me in the face the whole time.

18:50.208 --> 18:53.041
The person I love most is me.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.405
I love me most.

18:57.482 --> 19:00.144
You choose you?

19:02.220 --> 19:05.621
Look, if I could run across the beach
into my own arms, I would.

19:09.027 --> 19:11.518
Wait, what-
So where does that leave us?

19:11.596 --> 19:15.032
I'll figure that out after
I spend the summer by the pool.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.968
I feel this would be a lot clearer
when I'm much tanner.

19:22.674 --> 19:24.904
What a bunch of crap, man.

19:24.976 --> 19:28.639
You know, freakin' girls.
If it wasn't for the soft skin, the legs...

19:28.713 --> 19:32.649
the eyes, the long fingernails, the butts
and the boobs, I wouldn't even talk to 'em.

19:34.285 --> 19:36.446
All right. All right.
Picture time.

19:36.521 --> 19:38.546
Everybody get in front of the car.

19:38.623 --> 19:41.114
Hey, Forman, I got you a plant
for your new apartment...

19:41.192 --> 19:44.059
- but, um, I can't give it to you
in front of your parents.
- Oh!

19:48.700 --> 19:52.602
Okay, here we go.
One, two-

19:52.671 --> 19:57.165
- Guys, I have something to tell you.
- Just talk while you pose.

19:57.242 --> 20:01.303
Kitty, be sure to get me in the background
loadin' the last bunch of Eric's crap.

20:01.379 --> 20:05.042
- Aw, man.
- Okay, here we go. Smile.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.107
<i>[Flashbulb Pops]</i>

20:11.322 --> 20:13.847
Okay, tell them Laurie.

20:13.925 --> 20:16.519
I married Fez so he could stay
in the country!

20:17.429 --> 20:20.728
<i>[Flashbulbs Pop]</i>

20:27.739 --> 20:30.367
You did what?

20:30.442 --> 20:35.505
Don't worry, Daddy. I don't love him.
I was just bored.

20:35.580 --> 20:38.913
Yeah, but we will be
sleeping together.

20:41.686 --> 20:45.918
You- Ooh. Ooh.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.390
- Dad, are you all right?
- Uh, yeah. I'm fine.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.394
I'm just, uh- My arm hurts.

20:50.462 --> 20:54.831
Red. Red, you're all clammy.
Red, I think you're having a heart attack.

20:54.899 --> 20:57.993
- No. Open your eyes. He's having an arm attack.
- Michael-

20:59.304 --> 21:02.364
Michael, get a chair.
Laurie, call an ambulance.

21:04.809 --> 21:06.606
Okay. Hang in there, Dad.

21:14.252 --> 21:16.550
- Kitty?
- Yes, Red?

21:16.621 --> 21:19.590
If I don't make it...

21:19.657 --> 21:22.125
kill the foreigner.

21:29.534 --> 21:32.401
So, Red's gonna be okay, huh?

21:32.470 --> 21:35.564
Yeah, he's doing better, but they're gonna be
at the hospital for a while.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.006
- Hey, you got the letter for your folks?
- Yes.

21:38.076 --> 21:41.045
I told them I'm married,
and I'm not coming home.

21:41.112 --> 21:44.309
And that people have landed
on the great white head.

21:49.087 --> 21:51.248
<i>[Splashing]</i>

21:52.857 --> 21:55.382
Yeah, that'll get there.
