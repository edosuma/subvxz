WEBVTT

00:05.372 --> 00:06.304
Joelle...

00:06.305 --> 00:07.237
thought you said you were gonna

00:07.240 --> 00:08.606
stay in the garage.

00:08.608 --> 00:11.241
I thought you said
you were a securities trader.

00:11.243 --> 00:13.710
What do you want
to know about me?
How about
we start with your first name?

00:13.712 --> 00:14.744
(laughs)

00:14.746 --> 00:17.079
That bring back
some memories?

00:17.081 --> 00:18.380
Is this my father?

00:18.382 --> 00:20.448
Maybe he is,
maybe he isn't.

00:20.450 --> 00:24.385
Detective Jacqueline Rivera,
LAPD, Internal Affairs.

00:24.387 --> 00:26.253
The LAPD

00:26.255 --> 00:27.387
has decided to open

00:27.389 --> 00:29.122
an investigation

00:29.124 --> 00:30.389
into you.

00:42.302 --> 00:44.201
(panting)

00:56.682 --> 00:59.349
¶ ¶

01:03.288 --> 01:05.354
(panting)

01:12.296 --> 01:13.662
(car alarm chirps)

01:13.664 --> 01:16.364
(sighs)

01:16.366 --> 01:18.632
(sniffles)

01:18.634 --> 01:20.734
You're a big boy, Arkady.

01:20.736 --> 01:23.536
You should know not to play
with other people's toys.

01:23.538 --> 01:25.538
What the hell does that mean?

01:25.540 --> 01:27.072
Who sent you?

01:27.074 --> 01:29.174
Friends.
(laughing):
Oh.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.442
Friends don't make friends
wake up this early.

01:31.444 --> 01:33.444
These kind of friends do.

01:33.446 --> 01:35.412
Go home.

01:35.414 --> 01:38.348
I won't tell. I promise.

01:38.350 --> 01:41.450
Arkady, this is not going away.

01:42.719 --> 01:45.419
(grunting)

01:47.089 --> 01:49.155
(grunting)

01:54.228 --> 01:55.460
(two gunshots echoing)

01:57.363 --> 01:59.396
Call 911.

01:59.398 --> 02:00.697
WOMAN (over radio):
What's going on?

02:00.699 --> 02:02.365
Get the cops!

02:07.137 --> 02:09.637
(remote chirps)

02:55.217 --> 02:57.917
Wow. Sure you
got everything?

02:57.919 --> 02:59.852
(laughing):
I know. Even my kindergartners

02:59.854 --> 03:01.587
have started calling me
"The Bag Lady."

03:01.589 --> 03:02.921
It's a problem.

03:02.923 --> 03:04.254
I'll see you tonight?

03:07.726 --> 03:08.725
What?

03:08.727 --> 03:11.227
How's your day looking?

03:12.930 --> 03:14.930
You know...

03:14.932 --> 03:16.932
each day has its own surprises.

03:16.934 --> 03:20.735
No, Callen,<i> my</i> days have
surprises, often having

03:20.737 --> 03:22.670
to do with
bodily functions.
(laughs)

03:22.672 --> 03:24.471
Your days...

03:27.175 --> 03:29.308
On the bright side, at least
I won't be in prison.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.576
Well, that's a plus.

03:31.578 --> 03:34.245
I take it you haven't dated
an ex-con before?

03:34.247 --> 03:37.181
Mm, the whole bad boy thing
never really appealed to me.

03:37.183 --> 03:40.584
Well, except when Marky Mark was
in those underwear ads.

03:40.586 --> 03:43.253
(laughing)

03:43.255 --> 03:45.255
Joelle...

03:46.391 --> 03:48.424
...you can trust me.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.261
I know I can.

03:52.263 --> 03:54.396
I'm just still
getting used to all this.

03:54.398 --> 03:56.197
To you.

03:56.199 --> 03:58.432
The real you.

04:00.202 --> 04:02.335
So, I'll see you tonight?

04:03.338 --> 04:05.338
Be safe.

04:17.284 --> 04:19.350
(phone buzzing)

04:23.756 --> 04:25.822
(engine starting)

04:31.862 --> 04:34.295
What do we have?

04:39.234 --> 04:41.701
Play him the video.

04:41.703 --> 04:45.371
This is security footage
from a parking garage

04:45.373 --> 04:46.939
in downtown,
early this morning.

04:52.012 --> 04:54.645
Arkady. What's he done now?

04:54.647 --> 04:56.413
Just keep watching.

05:00.719 --> 05:02.351
NELL:
The vehicle that exploded

05:02.353 --> 05:04.419
was registered to
Arkady Kolcheck.

05:04.421 --> 05:05.720
GRANGER:
Because of the circles

05:05.722 --> 05:07.788
he ran in,
and the people he knew,

05:07.790 --> 05:10.791
we need to figure out
who wanted him dead and why.

05:10.793 --> 05:12.793
Well, he had a lot of enemies.

05:12.795 --> 05:15.262
Guess it was just
a matter of time

05:15.264 --> 05:16.997
before his past
caught up with him.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.732
NELL:
We don't actually know

05:18.734 --> 05:20.400
what happened this morning.

05:20.402 --> 05:22.502
Security cameras at the parking
garage didn't catch it.

05:22.504 --> 05:24.570
So, we just have video
of the before,

05:24.572 --> 05:26.371
and crime scene photos
of the after.

05:30.276 --> 05:32.342
DEEKS: Looks like he was
running away from somebody

05:32.344 --> 05:33.994
in that alley.

05:33.995 --> 05:35.645
And his security
detail was not with him.

05:35.647 --> 05:38.047
Only reason he'd do that is

05:38.049 --> 05:40.315
if he didn't know
who he could trust.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.317
Would you two check out
his house?

05:43.319 --> 05:44.985
Okay.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.424
Let's go pay our respects.

05:53.794 --> 05:55.693
Was Arkady in any
kind of trouble?

05:55.695 --> 05:57.027
You mean any more than usual?

05:57.029 --> 05:58.595
The last time
we spoke to him,

05:58.597 --> 06:00.463
he hinted the water
might be getting rough.

06:02.433 --> 06:04.499
Looks like the storm
finally found him.

06:15.878 --> 06:18.311
Do you really think
it's a good idea

06:18.313 --> 06:20.413
to keep Kensi and Deeks
in the field together?

06:20.415 --> 06:23.382
Well, their
extra-curricular activities

06:23.384 --> 06:26.785
don't seem to have caused
any problems yet.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.486
No, I'm talking about the LAPD

06:28.488 --> 06:30.754
internal investigation
into Deeks.

06:30.756 --> 06:33.490
We need to make sure
he's protected.
Ah.

06:33.492 --> 06:37.660
Frankly, I'm more concerned
with Mr. Callen at the moment.

06:37.662 --> 06:39.395
Was Arkady a close friend?

06:39.397 --> 06:43.565
Does anyone have close friends
in our line of work?

06:43.567 --> 06:45.433
So, what's the problem?

06:48.471 --> 06:51.672
Arkady Kolcheck may have been

06:51.674 --> 06:53.807
Callen's last chance

06:53.809 --> 06:57.510
at finding out
who his father was,

06:57.512 --> 06:59.378
and where
he came from.

07:03.784 --> 07:05.984
Looks like we're not
the first ones here.

07:05.986 --> 07:07.919
One,

07:07.921 --> 07:09.520
two, three.

07:20.765 --> 07:22.598
Clear.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.132
Yeah, clear.

07:24.134 --> 07:26.501
I may be going out
on a limb here,

07:26.503 --> 07:28.002
but, uh,

07:28.004 --> 07:29.970
pretty sure they were
looking for something.

07:31.940 --> 07:33.005
Thanks.
You're welcome.

07:33.941 --> 07:35.974
Thank you.

07:44.451 --> 07:45.616
(sighs)

07:45.618 --> 07:47.417
You good?

07:47.419 --> 07:50.453
Of course I am.

07:50.455 --> 07:52.455
Why?

07:52.457 --> 07:54.824
I can't ask my partner
how he's doing?

07:54.826 --> 07:57.660
Just making conversation,
being friendly.

07:57.662 --> 08:00.462
Polite response would be for
you to ask me how I'm doing.

08:14.176 --> 08:15.125
Just doesn't feel right.

08:15.126 --> 08:16.075
There's no way of knowing
who this is.

08:16.077 --> 08:19.711
Dental records are gonna take
forever to come back.

08:19.713 --> 08:21.779
Maybe Arkady's not dead.

08:23.916 --> 08:27.584
It's fascinating.
What?

08:27.586 --> 08:28.785
You're not sure how you feel

08:28.787 --> 08:30.720
about your friend
Arkady being dead.

08:30.722 --> 08:32.888
Let's get one thing clear:

08:32.890 --> 08:34.756
We weren't friends.

08:34.758 --> 08:37.058
I was ready to pull
the trigger on him

08:37.060 --> 08:39.460
myself a few times myself.

08:39.462 --> 08:41.428
Don't let me get
on your bad side.

08:41.430 --> 08:43.496
I just...

08:45.433 --> 08:47.499
I got mixed
emotions about it.

09:04.617 --> 09:05.682
(camera clicks)

09:18.529 --> 09:23.597
(reading Russian)

09:25.968 --> 09:27.167
What's that mean?

09:27.169 --> 09:29.469
"Loyalty to party.

09:29.471 --> 09:31.704
Loyalty to Motherland."

09:33.474 --> 09:35.240
It's a rite of passage.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.976
KGB used to give this
to all their agents.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.610
Arkady?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.915
Wore his every day I knew him.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.328
There you go.
Thanks, man.

10:03.768 --> 10:05.801
Hey.

10:05.803 --> 10:07.869
You sure you're okay?

10:07.871 --> 10:09.971
I really wish
you'd stop asking me that.

10:09.973 --> 10:11.973
Look, Arkady knew
a lot of people,

10:11.975 --> 10:13.908
knew a lot of secrets,

10:13.910 --> 10:17.011
about you, about
your family...

10:18.080 --> 10:20.246
That's true.

10:20.248 --> 10:22.348
But if Eric has
taught me one thing,

10:22.350 --> 10:26.118
it's that origin stories
tend to disappoint.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.720
And in this scenario,
you're the superhero?

10:28.722 --> 10:31.055
I've been known to stop
a speeding bullet for you.

10:31.057 --> 10:32.756
Oh, okay, Super G.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.024
Well, let's hit up Kensi,
see what they've got.

10:35.026 --> 10:37.226
KENSI:
Hello, boys.

10:37.228 --> 10:39.228
What's the word?

10:39.230 --> 10:40.862
We decided to start
in the study,

10:40.864 --> 10:42.763
because that seems
to be what the intruder did.

10:42.765 --> 10:43.864
Any luck?

10:43.866 --> 10:45.398
They stole his hard drive.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.933
Arkady was old school.

10:47.935 --> 10:49.834
He never trusted technology.

10:49.836 --> 10:51.769
He had a paper backup
for everything.

10:51.771 --> 10:54.037
Old KGB habits die hard.

10:54.039 --> 10:55.905
Kens...

10:55.907 --> 10:58.274
there's a painting
in his house of a tree.

10:58.276 --> 11:00.809
See if you can find it.
Painting of a tree?

11:00.811 --> 11:03.912
A tree.
He was always going on and on
about the provenance of

11:03.914 --> 11:05.346
this painting or that
painting...

11:05.348 --> 11:06.780
But he never said squat
about the tree.

11:06.782 --> 11:08.815
It was also in a
different frame every time

11:08.817 --> 11:11.117
I was there.
Well, how often was that?

11:11.119 --> 11:12.651
He had a nice pool.

11:12.653 --> 11:13.652
KENSI:
Guys?

11:13.654 --> 11:15.754
I'm gonna find the tree.

11:15.756 --> 11:17.756
So our fearless leader has

11:17.758 --> 11:20.225
instructed us to...
Find a tree-- yeah, no,
I definitely heard that.

11:20.227 --> 11:22.660
But I did something much better:
I found fingerprints.

11:22.662 --> 11:25.229
Yeah, there are many of those
where people live.

11:25.231 --> 11:27.764
Unless you find 'em on
something that couldn't possibly

11:27.766 --> 11:30.099
have had fingerprints on it
until this morning.

11:30.101 --> 11:32.768
Dramatic pause,
dramatic pause...

11:32.770 --> 11:34.770
I present you with
something that could not

11:34.772 --> 11:36.204
possibly have had
fingerprints on it

11:36.206 --> 11:37.939
until this morning:
Exhibit A.

11:37.941 --> 11:39.106
Take a look. Ready?

11:39.108 --> 11:40.373
Fingerprint one,
fingerprint two.

11:40.375 --> 11:41.807
Watch and learn.

11:41.809 --> 11:43.675
This used to be here.

11:43.677 --> 11:45.293
You can tell by the dust line.

11:45.294 --> 11:46.910
And then it fell,
or was knocked over, down here--

11:46.913 --> 11:48.846
why there's glass on the floor--
at which point, someone

11:48.848 --> 11:51.048
picked it up and
put it up here.

11:51.050 --> 11:53.683
And by "someone" I mean the
intruder and by "sometime"

11:53.685 --> 11:55.351
I mean this morning.

11:55.353 --> 11:57.886
And if they're not Arkady's,
they belong to our bad guy.

11:57.888 --> 11:59.387
Which is why I am
now gonna take

11:59.389 --> 12:02.356
a picture and send it
back to Eric in Ops.

12:02.358 --> 12:04.191
Mm-hmm.

12:04.193 --> 12:06.860
Oh, yeah?
You like that, don't you?

12:06.862 --> 12:09.696
I do. I do love
when you talk detective.
Oh, yeah?

12:09.698 --> 12:11.397
Well, I can talk detective
to you all night long.

12:11.399 --> 12:12.798
Oh, I know you can.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.866
I can talk search warrants.
Mm-hmm...

12:14.868 --> 12:15.967
Chain of custody.
Mm-hmm.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.435
Forensic DNA evidence.
Mm-hmm...

12:17.437 --> 12:20.337
Talk about some
severed pinkies.
Mm...

12:20.339 --> 12:21.338
...mm.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.339
No.

12:22.341 --> 12:23.840
Moment's gone.

12:23.842 --> 12:25.341
I'm gonna go find the tree.

12:25.343 --> 12:28.077
Oh, forget the tree!
God, son of a...

12:28.079 --> 12:30.379
(sighs)
Note to self.

12:30.381 --> 12:32.981
Severed and amputated pinkies--
too far.

12:32.983 --> 12:34.115
Who would have thought?

12:34.117 --> 12:35.783
(computer beeps)

12:35.785 --> 12:38.252
Wow. All right,
we're in business.

12:38.254 --> 12:40.287
Did you I.D. the guy
chasing Arkady?

12:40.289 --> 12:41.988
Y... Not yet.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.991
But this photo that we got
from Arkady's house

12:44.993 --> 12:47.059
might tell us something.

12:47.061 --> 12:48.794
Deeks apparently
figured it out.

12:48.796 --> 12:51.797
I'm running a search
on the prints now.

12:51.799 --> 12:54.866
Apparently? Eric, do you
have something against Deeks?

12:54.868 --> 12:57.935
No. But, you know,

12:57.937 --> 13:00.070
he's just, uh...

13:01.006 --> 13:02.505
Deeks.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.473
The man does love his hair.
(computer beeps)

13:04.475 --> 13:05.841
Ooh, that was quick.

13:05.843 --> 13:07.909
Yeah.

13:07.911 --> 13:10.411
Uh, too quick.

13:10.413 --> 13:11.945
It's Arkady.

13:11.947 --> 13:13.479
One down, one to go.

13:17.218 --> 13:19.251
Arkady had some
eclectic taste.

13:19.253 --> 13:21.019
Think he paid money for that?

13:21.021 --> 13:22.854
I think he lost a bet.

13:22.856 --> 13:24.922
Thought I'd feel guilty
about destroying a piece of art,

13:24.924 --> 13:26.756
but this be
the right thing to do.

13:29.961 --> 13:31.527
Ready?

13:38.335 --> 13:40.101
Hello, ladies.

13:45.341 --> 13:47.407
Let's see what we got.

13:48.977 --> 13:51.310
DEEKS:
It's a deed to a yacht.

13:51.312 --> 13:52.811
That belongs to Arkady.

13:52.813 --> 13:54.880
Did Callen ever mention
Arkady having a yacht?

13:54.881 --> 13:56.948
No. I didn't even think
he had yacht money.
That's true.

13:56.950 --> 13:58.115
He's not Jay Z.

13:58.117 --> 14:00.484
Maybe it wasn't his money.

14:04.923 --> 14:06.989
So... (sighs)

14:10.461 --> 14:12.260
I...

14:17.166 --> 14:19.933
(sighs) I have looked through
every single piece of traffic

14:19.935 --> 14:23.036
and security footage from before
the car explosion this morning.

14:23.038 --> 14:25.138
I'm guessing that
didn't go so well.

14:25.140 --> 14:28.141
No one followed Arkady
into that parking garage.

14:28.143 --> 14:31.043
And that man certainly didn't
run for his health.

14:31.045 --> 14:33.979
It's like he was spooked.
So...

14:33.981 --> 14:36.181
Arkady was killed by a ghost.

14:36.183 --> 14:39.083
Well, I'm certainly not
telling Hetty that.

14:39.085 --> 14:41.218
Got a lot to live for.

14:41.220 --> 14:44.287
Okay, Eric, maybe you're just
looking at it the wrong way.

14:45.990 --> 14:47.522
I've looked everywhere.

14:47.524 --> 14:49.991
So we know this guy knows
how to avoid the cameras.

14:49.993 --> 14:51.859
Right? What if...

14:51.861 --> 14:53.861
Oh, my God, that's it.

14:53.863 --> 14:55.095
I love you.

14:56.031 --> 14:58.531
And by you, I mean your mind.

14:58.533 --> 15:01.233
Your beautiful, gorgeous mind.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.535
Thank you.
Sometimes...

15:03.537 --> 15:05.203
I feel like I want to just

15:05.205 --> 15:07.004
take a little piece of it
home with me.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.806
Home with you?
Yeah.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.607
Just part of the prefrontal
cortex, right here.

15:11.977 --> 15:14.010
So, like, a lobotomy?

15:14.012 --> 15:15.161
No, not like a lobotomy...

15:15.162 --> 15:16.311
Oh, my God.
Exactly like a lobotomy.

15:16.314 --> 15:18.347
I'm a monster.

15:19.316 --> 15:21.249
You're picturing my brain

15:21.251 --> 15:22.984
right now, aren't you?

15:23.920 --> 15:25.152
Maybe I should just...

15:25.154 --> 15:26.219
Get back to work?

15:26.221 --> 15:28.087
Yeah.
Great idea.

15:29.924 --> 15:32.224
I'm trying to think of something
I could say right now

15:32.226 --> 15:34.025
that would make this
less weird.

15:34.027 --> 15:36.027
Mm. Not possible.

15:36.029 --> 15:37.161
Okay.

15:45.470 --> 15:46.969
What is that?

15:46.971 --> 15:49.972
That is tofu.

15:49.974 --> 15:51.606
I think.
It's Joelle's idea.

15:51.608 --> 15:54.275
I know what it is, G, but
what's it doing on your plate?

15:54.277 --> 15:56.543
We only come here because you
like their Achin' Bacon Burger.

15:56.545 --> 15:58.578
Well...

15:58.580 --> 16:00.513
trying to eat a little
healthier, that's all.

16:00.515 --> 16:02.147
Oh.

16:02.149 --> 16:04.516
You know soy converts
into estrogen, right?

16:05.452 --> 16:07.185
I can't win with you, can I?

16:07.187 --> 16:08.886
No, 'cause you take
everything to extremes.

16:08.888 --> 16:10.354
Hold on a second.

16:10.356 --> 16:12.489
Name one thing
I do that's extreme.

16:12.491 --> 16:15.391
You're a grown man, you sleep
on a mattress on the floor.

16:15.393 --> 16:17.526
I... like sleeping
on the floor.

16:17.528 --> 16:20.061
Depriving yourself like that,
living like a monk--

16:20.063 --> 16:22.063
It's gonna
catch up with you.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.330
Make you do something
you regret.

16:23.332 --> 16:25.432
Like what?
I don't know.

16:25.434 --> 16:27.600
Join a cult.
Oh, you mean
like the Office

16:27.602 --> 16:30.069
of Special Projects for NCIS?

16:30.071 --> 16:31.503
Burn through your savings.

16:31.505 --> 16:32.570
I already did that.

16:32.572 --> 16:34.071
To save
my cult leader, no less.

16:34.073 --> 16:35.506
Exactly.

16:35.507 --> 16:36.940
You know what,
at least I don't, uh,

16:36.942 --> 16:38.141
practice shooting
the gun left-handed,

16:38.143 --> 16:40.009
or-or deactivating bombs

16:40.011 --> 16:42.144
on train tracks.
Those are valuable skills.

16:42.146 --> 16:45.046
That are also extreme.
Yeah, but it's work.

16:45.048 --> 16:46.180
It's not personal.

16:46.182 --> 16:48.515
Is this about Joelle?

16:48.517 --> 16:51.050
No, this-this is about you.
And how you live.

16:51.052 --> 16:54.586
I think this is more personal
than I prefer at a work lunch.

16:54.588 --> 16:56.220
Oh, this
is a work lunch.

16:56.222 --> 16:58.255
So... why do you think
Arkady had a yacht?

16:58.257 --> 17:00.657
Decent-size yacht like that

17:00.659 --> 17:03.993
could move a decent
amount of guns, drugs...

17:03.995 --> 17:06.261
Think Arkady had it in him
to smuggle drugs?

17:07.697 --> 17:09.963
I wouldn't put anything
past Arkady.

17:11.433 --> 17:15.001
Now, whoever killed Arkady
knew where the cameras were.

17:15.003 --> 17:17.269
But I this is who
we're looking for.

17:17.271 --> 17:18.970
Now, I was able to find

17:18.972 --> 17:21.539
pieces of his face
in window reflections,

17:21.541 --> 17:23.641
car side mirrors,
what have you.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.576
It's all very Picassoesque.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.146
All right, here goes nothing.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.624
Maybe you<i> should</i> tell Hetty
it was a ghost.

17:50.167 --> 17:52.767
Oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, tiger.

17:52.769 --> 17:55.336
Sorry, sorry.
We just identified

17:55.338 --> 17:57.171
the person who
blew up Arkady's car.

17:57.173 --> 17:58.172
And?

17:58.174 --> 17:59.506
And...

17:59.508 --> 18:00.807
you'll never guess
who it is.

18:00.809 --> 18:03.176
Why is your team so hell-bent

18:03.178 --> 18:05.545
on finding the drama
in everything?

18:05.547 --> 18:08.281
Oh, lighten up, Owen.
Sheesh.

18:14.588 --> 18:16.554
(coughing)

18:18.391 --> 18:21.125
I'm not giving you the Heimlich.
You chose to eat that. What?

18:28.300 --> 18:30.433
You boys miss me?

18:43.180 --> 18:45.446
Callen, don't look so surprised.

18:45.448 --> 18:47.281
I am like a grizzly bear.

18:47.283 --> 18:48.882
Nothing can
take me down.

18:48.884 --> 18:50.783
Oh, I can think of something.
Arkady, what the hell's

18:50.785 --> 18:52.718
going on?
What?

18:52.719 --> 18:54.652
I came to visit my friends,
find out what you planned

18:54.655 --> 18:57.188
for my funeral.
Please, tell me...

18:57.190 --> 18:58.822
(blows)
...bagpipes.

18:58.824 --> 19:00.523
Did you fake your own death?

19:00.525 --> 19:03.142
You ransack your own house?

19:03.143 --> 19:05.760
No, no, someone genuinely tried
to kill me this morning.

19:05.763 --> 19:07.262
What the hell
is that, tofu?

19:07.264 --> 19:10.565
Did you give up meat
to mourn my death?

19:10.567 --> 19:12.433
I didn't know
you felt so strong.

19:12.435 --> 19:14.835
What happened this morning?

19:16.738 --> 19:20.306
I was out early,
does not matter why.

19:20.308 --> 19:21.340
My sixth sense

19:21.342 --> 19:23.175
tells me I'm not alone.

19:23.177 --> 19:26.678
So I start running,
and this nut job follows me.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.813
He pulls gun, I...

19:28.815 --> 19:31.148
protect myself.

19:31.150 --> 19:32.449
I shoot him.

19:32.451 --> 19:33.917
With his gun?

19:33.919 --> 19:36.185
Was only gun I had.

19:37.254 --> 19:38.253
That's it?

19:39.256 --> 19:41.322
Yeah, more or less.

19:41.324 --> 19:43.223
At what point
did your car explode?

19:43.225 --> 19:45.725
I forgot that part.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.197
(alarm chirps)

19:52.833 --> 19:56.668
Hold on. Your car
was already rigged to blow?

19:57.904 --> 19:59.169
Ah.

19:59.171 --> 20:01.404
It pays to be prepared.

20:01.406 --> 20:03.239
You have any other cars
preloaded with explosives

20:03.241 --> 20:04.740
parked around town?

20:04.742 --> 20:07.242
You don't?

20:07.244 --> 20:09.394
What about the pocket watch?

20:09.395 --> 20:11.545
Ah, that was special
for you, Agent Callen.

20:11.548 --> 20:13.180
Dramatic,

20:13.182 --> 20:14.748
but I needed you to know
the dead body

20:14.750 --> 20:16.716
was me--
buy me some time.

20:16.718 --> 20:18.217
Buy you some time
for what?

20:18.219 --> 20:20.719
To find out who tried
to kill me, what else?

20:20.721 --> 20:22.353
Then enlighten us.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.188
Uh... (exhales)

20:24.190 --> 20:25.822
...could be...

20:25.824 --> 20:27.323
Chechens.

20:27.325 --> 20:30.426
Could be...
Albanians.

20:30.428 --> 20:33.896
Iranians.

20:33.898 --> 20:36.298
Could be somebody else.
I don't know.
Mm-hmm.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.266
So why are you here?

20:38.268 --> 20:39.734
You want protection?

20:41.270 --> 20:43.203
I can take care myself.

20:43.205 --> 20:45.505
You sure about that?

20:45.507 --> 20:48.241
'Cause we can't
protect you

20:48.243 --> 20:50.243
if we don't know
who we're protecting you from.

20:50.245 --> 20:52.311
Could be North Koreans.

20:55.349 --> 20:57.315
Do the North Koreans
know about the yacht?

20:58.284 --> 21:00.217
What yacht?

21:00.219 --> 21:03.220
The one whose paperwork was
hidden in a frame at your house.

21:03.989 --> 21:06.990
I don't even like yachts.

21:06.992 --> 21:09.993
Way too... flashy.

21:09.995 --> 21:12.528
He's gonna need
protection, all right.

21:12.530 --> 21:14.463
From me.

21:17.301 --> 21:19.768
Coast Guard is always happy
to help out.

21:19.770 --> 21:22.237
Now, tell me
about this yacht.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.838
Uh, vessel's name
is<i> Cairo Nights.</i>

21:23.840 --> 21:26.240
120 ton category,
118 feet long,

21:26.242 --> 21:29.343
with a sun deck,
apparently.

21:29.345 --> 21:31.678
Know what country
it's flagged to?

21:31.680 --> 21:32.945
No.

21:32.947 --> 21:33.979
Do you know
what port it left from?

21:33.981 --> 21:35.013
No.

21:35.015 --> 21:36.414
Owner's name?

21:38.251 --> 21:39.783
Maybe.

21:39.785 --> 21:42.886
But you're not at liberty
to say.

21:42.888 --> 21:45.021
It's part
of an open investigation, so...

21:45.023 --> 21:48.758
So... you want us to find
118 feet of yacht sailing

21:48.760 --> 21:51.360
somewhere
in water that...

21:51.362 --> 21:53.628
spans 71%
of the Earth's surface?

21:53.630 --> 21:54.829
When you say
it like that,

21:54.831 --> 21:57.264
it makes it sound impossible.
Not at all.

21:57.266 --> 21:59.432
It's what the Coast Guard
does best.

22:08.275 --> 22:09.807
No.

22:10.743 --> 22:11.742
You put me in here before.

22:11.744 --> 22:13.610
With Henrietta.
So?

22:13.612 --> 22:15.878
So your boss doesn't
take up much space,

22:15.880 --> 22:18.347
but she made room feel
like coffin.

22:18.349 --> 22:19.715
I'm not going back.

22:19.717 --> 22:22.551
Ark... Arkady.

22:22.553 --> 22:23.652
Arkady!

22:23.654 --> 22:26.521
Interrogation room. Now.

22:26.523 --> 22:28.456
I feel like I'm talking
to my kid.

22:28.458 --> 22:30.391
But this is so much
more comfortable.

22:30.393 --> 22:31.058
You've got couch,

22:31.060 --> 22:32.659
canoe...

22:32.661 --> 22:34.293
coffee...

22:34.295 --> 22:35.294
It's fresh?

22:35.296 --> 22:37.062
Double shot.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.564
Please.

22:39.566 --> 22:43.000
Okay. Let's try this again.

22:43.002 --> 22:44.368
Okay.

22:44.370 --> 22:45.502
Who tried to kill you
this morning?

22:45.504 --> 22:47.070
If I had a nickel
for every time

22:47.072 --> 22:49.405
someone tried to kill me...

22:49.407 --> 22:50.773
You'd buy a yacht?
What yacht?

22:50.775 --> 22:52.741
Arkady, we're trying

22:52.743 --> 22:54.943
to help you.
The feeling is mutual.

22:54.945 --> 22:56.744
Bet you're not feeling
so ambivalent now, huh?

22:56.746 --> 22:57.878
(wry chuckle)

22:57.880 --> 22:58.979
Ambivalent about what?

22:58.981 --> 23:00.647
About you
being dead.
Is true?

23:00.649 --> 23:02.649
CALLEN:
Yes.

23:02.651 --> 23:05.718
You hurt my feelings.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.353
I'm sure I do.
So start talking.

23:08.355 --> 23:10.521
'Cause neither one of us
will hesitate to turn you loose.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.391
ERIC (over monitor):
Callen.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.060
What do you have, Eric?
We're talking to Arkady.

23:17.062 --> 23:17.994
(typing)

23:17.996 --> 23:20.363
Why is he on the couch?

23:20.365 --> 23:23.032
New interrogation technique.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.367
All right. Well, I got a match

23:25.369 --> 23:27.769
for the second set of prints
found at Arkady's house.

23:27.771 --> 23:30.104
They belong
to a Brett Edward Smith.

23:30.106 --> 23:31.905
Male, 42 years old.

23:31.907 --> 23:34.107
No criminal record
but he's a former cop.

23:34.109 --> 23:35.775
The really interesting part is

23:35.777 --> 23:38.744
he was suspended from the LAPD
in 2008.

23:38.746 --> 23:40.679
Went into private security.

23:40.681 --> 23:41.713
You got an address?

23:41.715 --> 23:42.714
Uh, last known address

23:42.716 --> 23:44.449
is in Redondo Beach.

23:44.451 --> 23:46.751
And it's now a shopping mall.

23:46.753 --> 23:49.120
Any luck I.D.'ing the body
from the explosion?

23:49.122 --> 23:51.055
ERIC: Still working on that.
CALLEN: All right. Thanks.

23:53.959 --> 23:56.025
This the guy who tried
to attack you this morning?

23:56.027 --> 23:58.761
Is old police photo I.D.

23:58.763 --> 24:01.396
I mean, maybe him, maybe not.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.598
But the name rings a bell,
doesn't it?
Smith is

24:03.600 --> 24:04.732
common name.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.133
Like Smirnov in Russia.

24:06.135 --> 24:08.401
What aren't you
telling us, Arkady?

24:09.670 --> 24:12.570
What you're not ready to hear.

24:15.708 --> 24:17.107
(sighs)

24:27.786 --> 24:29.652
KENSI: I'll let you
know, Callen.

24:29.654 --> 24:31.787
Okay. Thanks.

24:31.789 --> 24:34.523
Arkady is stonewalling them.

24:34.525 --> 24:35.924
Of course he is.
What fun would it be

24:35.926 --> 24:37.692
if he made it easy
for us to protect him?

24:37.694 --> 24:39.694
Hm. Fingerprints found
at Arkady's house belong

24:39.696 --> 24:41.962
to a disgraced LAPD cop
named Brett Smith.

24:41.964 --> 24:43.163
You know him?

24:43.165 --> 24:44.898
I don't think
I remember a Brett Smith.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.766
Is he the one that went after
Arkady this morning?

24:46.768 --> 24:47.900
Starting to look that way.

24:47.902 --> 24:49.835
They're trying
to make a positive I.D.

24:49.837 --> 24:51.937
Which leaves us with...

24:51.939 --> 24:53.571
Arkady stonewalling us.
For fun.

24:53.573 --> 24:54.972
(computer beeps)
Awesome.

24:54.974 --> 24:57.808
I may have something.
Take a look at this.

24:57.810 --> 25:00.143
I believe the vessel
you're looking for left

25:00.145 --> 25:02.812
the La Guaira port outside
of Caracas yesterday.

25:02.814 --> 25:05.548
I'm still waiting on details
from the Venezuelan government.

25:05.550 --> 25:07.917
Mm. Could be waiting
on them for a while.
Anything else?

25:07.919 --> 25:10.085
Yes. It has a transponder.

25:10.087 --> 25:12.687
And the plot thickens.

25:12.689 --> 25:13.888
Why does the plot thicken?

25:13.890 --> 25:14.889
Because 118-foot yachts

25:14.891 --> 25:17.424
don't have transponders.

25:17.426 --> 25:19.993
Cargo ships have transponders.

25:19.995 --> 25:21.861
So Arkady must have doctored
the paperwork.
Mm-hmm.

25:21.863 --> 25:23.562
Can you track the boat?

25:23.564 --> 25:25.030
As long as they keep
the transponder turned on.

25:25.032 --> 25:26.598
Do you think
we can get a visual?

25:26.600 --> 25:27.932
Not until we have
a weather satellite

25:27.934 --> 25:28.999
positioned over it.

25:29.001 --> 25:30.734
How long do you
think that'll be?

25:32.170 --> 25:34.904
Five hours, 22 minutes.

25:34.906 --> 25:37.573
(sighs)

25:37.575 --> 25:38.974
Know anything about a ship
that left a port

25:38.976 --> 25:41.042
near Caracas yesterday morning?

25:41.044 --> 25:44.045
Ships come in, ships go out.

25:44.047 --> 25:47.481
SAM: Your yacht
is suddenly a cargo ship.

25:47.483 --> 25:48.582
Why?

25:48.584 --> 25:51.117
Mm, I don't...
Maybe we should just

25:51.119 --> 25:54.086
turn you loose,
let you fend for yourself.

25:56.090 --> 25:57.889
Fine.

25:57.891 --> 25:59.690
Give me your phone.
My phone,

25:59.692 --> 26:03.060
my private property.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.115
SAM:
You know what,

26:08.116 --> 26:10.066
while we're protecting you from
whoever's trying to kill you,

26:10.068 --> 26:12.134
you don't have
any personal property.

26:12.136 --> 26:15.804
Hey! Give that back!

26:15.806 --> 26:17.906
You afraid
he might find something?

26:17.908 --> 26:21.075
(reading in Russian)

26:21.077 --> 26:23.277
He's right.

26:23.279 --> 26:27.014
Anna is a pretty girl.

26:27.016 --> 26:29.116
Who is she?

26:29.118 --> 26:33.153
I know lots of pretty girls.

26:33.155 --> 26:35.588
That's a good comeback.

26:35.590 --> 26:38.057
A friend.

26:38.059 --> 26:41.126
She has nothing to do
with the boat.

26:41.128 --> 26:43.094
It's true.

26:43.096 --> 26:46.831
You just admitted
that there is a boat.

26:51.604 --> 26:53.770
A few months ago,

26:53.772 --> 26:56.272
I introduce some Russian
friends to American friends.

26:56.274 --> 26:59.008
Russians have cargo,
Americans have empty ship.

26:59.010 --> 27:00.809
There's no law against that.

27:00.811 --> 27:03.745
Actually, there is a very
specific law against that.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.147
American economic sanctions
against Russia.

27:06.149 --> 27:07.848
Did you broker the deal before

27:07.850 --> 27:09.316
or after the sanctions
came down?

27:09.318 --> 27:11.851
Uh, it... it was close.

27:11.853 --> 27:13.152
What was on the ship?

27:18.024 --> 27:19.356
(magazine rustling)

27:19.358 --> 27:22.892
Well, whatever it is,
you're worried about it.

27:22.894 --> 27:24.994
What makes you think that?

27:24.996 --> 27:27.062
Because you've been staring
at that same page

27:27.064 --> 27:28.862
since you got here.

27:31.967 --> 27:33.766
Okay.

27:34.902 --> 27:39.037
I will tell you everything
you need to know.

27:39.039 --> 27:41.172
And, hopefully,

27:41.174 --> 27:44.208
you will never have
to hear the rest.

27:49.014 --> 27:53.016
So, I found the company
that owns the cargo ship.

27:53.018 --> 27:55.952
It was hiding behind
a shell corporation.

27:55.954 --> 27:57.253
P&E Berkeley Shipping.

27:57.255 --> 27:59.221
Established in
2002 by Patrick

27:59.223 --> 28:01.890
and Elia Berkeley.
Husband and wife?

28:01.892 --> 28:03.725
Brother and sister.
Oh.

28:03.727 --> 28:05.226
All right, running 'em
through the database.

28:05.228 --> 28:07.094
NELL: Looks like
their company's been

28:07.096 --> 28:09.162
in and out
of financial distress.

28:09.164 --> 28:11.097
Oh, things are about
to get worse.

28:11.099 --> 28:13.132
They're under investigation
by the DOJ.

28:13.134 --> 28:16.068
Hmm. For what?

28:16.070 --> 28:17.736
They're suspected
of circumventing U.S. sanctions

28:17.738 --> 28:19.270
for the last ten years,

28:19.272 --> 28:23.140
cutting deals with Iran,
Burma, Cuba, North Korea.

28:23.142 --> 28:25.775
Guessing we can
add Russia to the list.
Yeah.

28:25.777 --> 28:28.077
Ooh. Got something else.

28:28.079 --> 28:32.147
A certain Brett Smith has been
on their payroll since 2009.

28:32.149 --> 28:33.781
Head of security.

28:33.783 --> 28:36.150
That's the same guy
who ransacked Arkady's house.

28:36.152 --> 28:37.184
Better tell Hetty.

28:37.186 --> 28:39.252
No need. I will.

28:39.254 --> 28:40.987
This fish keeps getting bigger
and bigger.

28:40.989 --> 28:44.856
Find out everything you can
about Berkeley Shipping.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.259
(computer beeping)
Hmm.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.327
Now what?
So, the reason Smith

28:51.329 --> 28:54.997
was suspended from the LAPD
was for excessive force.

28:54.999 --> 28:58.166
Looks like another officer
was suspended along with him.

28:58.168 --> 28:59.901
Tom Keefer.

28:59.903 --> 29:01.836
After the two
were suspended,

29:01.838 --> 29:04.772
both Smith and Keefer
worked together for two

29:04.774 --> 29:06.073
private security firms

29:06.075 --> 29:09.009
before Smith became head
of security at Berkeley.

29:09.011 --> 29:11.044
He's not on Berkeley Shipping's
employee list.

29:11.046 --> 29:13.312
Maybe not officially.

29:13.314 --> 29:14.846
Maybe Keefer's Smith's go-to man

29:14.848 --> 29:16.314
when he needs
to go off the books.

29:16.316 --> 29:19.884
I have an address for Keefer
in Atwater Village.

29:19.886 --> 29:21.385
Have Kensi and Deeks
bring him in.

29:32.731 --> 29:34.797
(knocking)

29:35.766 --> 29:37.832
(continues knocking)

29:40.203 --> 29:43.404
No probable cause, no warrant.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.472
Then we wait.

29:47.876 --> 29:49.408
Apartment A.

29:49.410 --> 29:51.476
That means he's got to be close.

29:53.112 --> 29:55.178
Want to take a picture
of that license,

29:55.180 --> 29:57.780
send it to Eric, see if
it's registered to Keefer?

29:57.782 --> 29:59.848
I'd love nothing more.

30:02.085 --> 30:03.084
(camera clicks)

30:05.822 --> 30:07.288
(phone chimes)
All right, got it.

30:07.289 --> 30:08.755
Okay, so we have two
suspended LAPD officers,

30:08.758 --> 30:10.491
we have one dead body,
and one cargo ship.

30:10.493 --> 30:11.492
All leading to Arkady.

30:11.494 --> 30:12.493
Huh.

30:12.495 --> 30:13.494
(phone buzzes)
Ooh.

30:13.496 --> 30:15.963
Is it Keefer's?

30:15.965 --> 30:18.365
Yeah. But also the body
from this morning

30:18.367 --> 30:20.166
was identified
as Brett Smith.

30:20.168 --> 30:24.403
Well, then Keefer has
some big shoes to fill.

30:25.372 --> 30:27.105
You okay?

30:27.107 --> 30:27.972
Yeah.

30:30.376 --> 30:32.442
Oh, fantastic.

30:36.214 --> 30:38.948
(sighs heavily)

30:43.421 --> 30:45.020
Deeks?

30:45.022 --> 30:46.187
Hmm.

30:46.189 --> 30:48.222
Penny for your thoughts.

30:48.224 --> 30:51.325
I was just thinking
about stakeouts.

30:51.327 --> 30:54.961
Not as much fun
as they used to be.

30:54.963 --> 30:57.029
When the cat becomes the mouse.

30:57.031 --> 30:59.231
I know what you meant.

31:00.434 --> 31:04.335
Detective, uh, Rivera,
did she contact you again?

31:04.337 --> 31:06.337
No.

31:06.339 --> 31:08.939
I would have told you
if she had.

31:08.941 --> 31:10.573
Right. Of course.

31:10.575 --> 31:13.108
(quiet, wry laugh)

31:16.379 --> 31:18.379
I know you don't
want to talk

31:18.381 --> 31:21.181
about this...

31:21.183 --> 31:24.050
but if Detective Rivera
keeps digging,

31:24.052 --> 31:26.085
is she gonna find anything?

31:26.087 --> 31:27.853
Kensi, don't ask me
that question.

31:27.855 --> 31:30.121
Why not?

31:32.358 --> 31:36.326
Because I honestly don't know
how to answer it.

31:45.136 --> 31:46.568
You're in trouble now.

31:47.971 --> 31:50.037
Henrietta.

31:50.039 --> 31:52.239
Pleasure to see you again.

31:52.241 --> 31:55.442
I'm sorry I can't say the same,

31:55.444 --> 31:58.311
but my mother didn't
raise me to be a liar.

31:59.347 --> 32:01.347
He's all yours.

32:01.349 --> 32:04.383
So, if you want this agency

32:04.385 --> 32:06.385
to lift a pinky finger

32:06.387 --> 32:08.387
to help you...
I don't know

32:08.389 --> 32:10.455
what it is about you,

32:10.457 --> 32:12.890
but I really like you.

32:17.363 --> 32:20.397
The shipping company
that came to you for help

32:20.399 --> 32:22.432
is now coming for your head.

32:22.434 --> 32:24.066
Why is that?

32:24.068 --> 32:26.601
Sanctions were bigger headaches

32:26.603 --> 32:29.403
than I thought they'd be.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.438
I don't suffer fools gladly.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.540
Try again, please.

32:35.510 --> 32:38.878
(chuckles): I spent all
the money they gave me.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.380
I doubt they even paid you
for your efforts

32:41.382 --> 32:42.481
up front.

32:42.483 --> 32:44.916
Last chance, Arkady.

32:44.918 --> 32:47.251
Why do they want you dead?

32:49.054 --> 32:51.221
(grunts)

32:51.222 --> 32:53.389
Because I would not give them
their ship back.

32:55.393 --> 32:58.026
They wanted to pull out
of the deal?

32:58.028 --> 32:59.394
Why?

32:59.396 --> 33:02.363
They found out about the
DOJ investigation.

33:02.365 --> 33:04.365
But it was already
too late.

33:04.367 --> 33:06.233
Ship had left port.

33:06.235 --> 33:08.001
What was on the boat?

33:08.003 --> 33:11.070
More than
a hundred million dollars.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.271
CALLEN:
In what,

33:12.273 --> 33:14.273
shrink-wrapped bills?
No.

33:14.275 --> 33:18.443
The only true currency accepted
everywhere in the world.

33:18.445 --> 33:19.544
Oil.

33:19.546 --> 33:21.012
Yeah.

33:21.013 --> 33:22.479
Hundred million dollars'
worth of oil?

33:22.482 --> 33:24.114
Yeah.

33:24.116 --> 33:26.149
That's not a cargo ship.

33:26.151 --> 33:27.183
That's a supertanker.

33:27.185 --> 33:29.351
That's enough to finance a war.

33:45.969 --> 33:48.636
You brokered a deal
to supply a supertanker

33:48.638 --> 33:51.038
to break our economic sanctions
with Russia,

33:51.040 --> 33:53.707
and you have no idea where it is
or where it's headed?

33:53.709 --> 33:55.575
It is truth.
Wrong answer.

33:55.577 --> 33:57.977
It is not my ship.

33:57.979 --> 34:00.179
I am broker, middle man.

34:00.181 --> 34:01.413
Nobody tells me,

34:01.415 --> 34:04.149
and I sure as hell did not ask.

34:04.151 --> 34:05.617
When this case is over,

34:05.619 --> 34:08.252
you and I are going to have
a little chat about ethics.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.420
Berkeleys may know
where it's headed.

34:10.422 --> 34:12.021
Gonna have to flush them out.

34:12.023 --> 34:13.288
How?

34:14.224 --> 34:17.225
With a sacrificial cow.

34:18.461 --> 34:21.628
No one would ever mistake you
for a lamb.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.032
CALLEN:
Set it up, Arkady.

34:26.034 --> 34:27.333
Somewhere public.

34:30.571 --> 34:32.270
KENSI:
Deeks.

34:32.272 --> 34:34.338
(car alarm chirps)
That's our guy.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.174
(engine starts)
Too late.

34:38.176 --> 34:40.443
We'll take him when he stops.

34:42.213 --> 34:45.280
(engine starts)

34:50.419 --> 34:52.785
(sighs)
Here you go.

34:56.357 --> 34:58.623
Berkeleys one and two
headed your way.

34:58.625 --> 35:00.224
Get 'em talking, Arkady.

35:00.226 --> 35:02.292
Need to know who,
what and where.

35:02.294 --> 35:04.360
Not my first "ro-day-o."

35:05.296 --> 35:06.461
Rodeo.

35:06.463 --> 35:08.396
It's rodeo.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.264
I swear, you two sound like
an old married couple.

35:10.266 --> 35:11.832
ARKADY (over radio):
Is only because he loves me.

35:13.702 --> 35:15.535
Patrick, Elia.

35:15.537 --> 35:16.736
Sit, let's have a drink.

35:16.738 --> 35:18.204
ELIA:
This is hardly

35:18.206 --> 35:19.471
a social visit.

35:19.473 --> 35:21.806
Listen, we got DOJ
breathing down our necks.

35:21.808 --> 35:23.374
I don't know what
it is you got to do

35:23.376 --> 35:25.342
or what strings
you got to pull, but...

35:25.344 --> 35:26.876
But you need to turn
our ship around.

35:26.878 --> 35:28.410
ARKADY: You look upset.

35:28.412 --> 35:29.677
Sit. Sit, sit, sit.

35:29.679 --> 35:31.512
What's the name of the street
the hotel is on

35:31.514 --> 35:33.213
where Arkady is meeting
the Berkeleys?

35:33.215 --> 35:34.214
Argyle.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.715
About to cross Wilcox,

35:35.717 --> 35:37.216
so the hotel,
is it left or right?

35:37.218 --> 35:38.383
It's on the right side.

35:39.285 --> 35:41.551
All right. Call Eric.

35:41.553 --> 35:43.886
(phone line rings)

35:43.888 --> 35:45.821
Hey, Eric, will you tell
Sam and Callen

35:45.823 --> 35:47.689
looks like Keefer's
gonna show up to the party?

35:47.691 --> 35:49.857
ERIC: Callen, Sam,

35:49.859 --> 35:51.391
Keefer's on his way to you.

35:51.393 --> 35:53.459
Thanks, Eric.

35:58.399 --> 36:00.565
SAM: Looks like things are about
to get interesting.

36:20.919 --> 36:23.185
DEEKS:
There's Keefer's car.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.833
Kens... does that look
like blood to you?

36:42.604 --> 36:43.803
Ready?
Yep.

36:43.805 --> 36:45.871
One, two, three.

36:48.442 --> 36:50.508
That's Keefer.
So who've we been following?

36:52.311 --> 36:53.643
Stairs will be faster.

36:56.447 --> 36:59.414
Callen, Sam, it's not Keefer!

36:59.416 --> 37:00.448
(over radio): I repeat...
(radio static) ...Keefer!

37:00.450 --> 37:01.515
Get that, Sam?

37:01.517 --> 37:03.350
Something about Keefer.

37:13.228 --> 37:14.627
We go down, you go down.

37:14.629 --> 37:15.761
ARKADY:
It won't come to that.

37:31.311 --> 37:32.443
SAM:
Gun!

37:32.445 --> 37:34.445
(people screaming)

38:19.825 --> 38:21.391
(groans)

38:28.399 --> 38:30.499
Ambivalent, huh?

38:30.501 --> 38:32.400
Just doing my job.

38:32.402 --> 38:33.334
Ah, sure.

38:33.336 --> 38:34.401
Come on.

38:34.403 --> 38:35.802
Sam, you good?

38:35.804 --> 38:37.570
SAM: Good.
Callen?

38:37.572 --> 38:38.704
Good.

38:38.706 --> 38:41.006
Oh, my God...

38:41.008 --> 38:43.041
Eric, we need an ambulance.

38:43.043 --> 38:44.641
Elia!

38:47.712 --> 38:49.311
You good?

38:49.313 --> 38:51.879
Good.

38:54.550 --> 38:55.949
You know this guy?

38:55.951 --> 38:58.484
Never seen him before.

38:58.486 --> 39:00.586
He didn't come for me.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.355
He came for them.

39:06.893 --> 39:08.525
ELIA:
I have a question.

39:09.528 --> 39:11.594
What's in it for you?

39:11.596 --> 39:12.928
ARKADY:
What do you mean by that?

39:12.930 --> 39:14.562
ELIA:
This makes no sense.

39:14.564 --> 39:17.064
Your name is all over
the paperwork of that ship.

39:17.066 --> 39:18.532
(remote clicks, chirps)

39:18.534 --> 39:20.567
You didn't get them
to say much.

39:20.569 --> 39:22.502
Was winning their confidence.

39:22.504 --> 39:25.605
Few more minutes,
you have everything you need.

39:25.607 --> 39:26.906
Is Elia going to live?

39:26.908 --> 39:28.574
Yeah.

39:28.576 --> 39:31.343
And the idiot shooter?

39:33.447 --> 39:35.914
Russian, Nikolai Brantov.

39:35.916 --> 39:36.981
Contract killer.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.515
You got a theory, Arkady?

39:39.451 --> 39:41.617
Do you?

39:42.920 --> 39:45.487
Berkeleys
couldn't stand the heat.

39:45.489 --> 39:46.955
They wanted to shut
the deal down,

39:46.957 --> 39:48.323
turn the ship around.

39:48.325 --> 39:51.426
They sent Smith to kill you.

39:51.428 --> 39:55.363
That didn't work out good
for Smith.

39:55.365 --> 39:56.764
Russians wanted to proceed
with the deal,

39:56.766 --> 39:58.932
sent Brantov to kill
the Berkeleys.

40:00.602 --> 40:02.902
One more question:

40:02.904 --> 40:04.637
Who's Anna?

40:04.639 --> 40:07.873
Nice Russian girl.

40:08.909 --> 40:11.075
Am I free to go?

40:11.077 --> 40:12.042
For the time being.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.714
Arkady...

40:34.598 --> 40:36.564
(speaks Russian)

40:36.566 --> 40:40.367
(replies in Russian)

40:40.369 --> 40:42.402
But loyalty to family...

40:42.404 --> 40:44.670
trumps them both.

40:44.672 --> 40:47.406
Every time, my friend.

40:47.408 --> 40:49.474
Every time.

41:04.823 --> 41:06.889
Heading for home,
gentlemen?

41:06.891 --> 41:08.690
Dinner with Joelle, actually.

41:08.692 --> 41:11.392
We're having some, uh,
Chinese vegetarian thing.

41:11.394 --> 41:13.060
Not my first choice.

41:13.062 --> 41:15.529
I'm going home to kiss
my wife and kids.

41:15.531 --> 41:17.464
Today's been exhausting.

41:17.465 --> 41:19.398
Never a dull moment,
is there, Mr. Hanna?

41:19.401 --> 41:20.967
Never.

41:20.969 --> 41:22.868
In fact, I have a hunch

41:22.870 --> 41:25.570
this one isn't quite over with.

41:26.472 --> 41:28.705
That's just you
being pessimistic.

41:28.707 --> 41:32.174
And to think, my parents
almost named me Pollyanna.

41:33.477 --> 41:34.509
Nell...

41:34.511 --> 41:36.077
any update on
the oil tanker?

41:36.079 --> 41:37.945
Yeah, it's not there.

41:37.947 --> 41:39.713
What do you mean,
it's not there?

41:39.715 --> 41:41.548
Weather satellite
couldn't find it.

41:41.550 --> 41:43.550
And the ship's transponder
has been turned off.

41:45.754 --> 41:48.654
I think it might be a good idea
if we brought Arkady back

41:48.656 --> 41:51.490
for one more little chat,
Mr. Callen.

41:51.492 --> 41:55.060
I have a feeling he's gonna
be difficult to find, Hetty.

41:55.062 --> 41:56.694
Oh...

41:56.696 --> 41:59.530
<i> You don't say.</i>
