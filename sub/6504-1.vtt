Q-u-a-r...

01:22.032 --> 01:23.632
a-n-t...

01:26.579 --> 01:28.346
i-n-e.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.660
Quarantine.

01:35.427 --> 01:37.586
Q-u-a-r...

01:41.552 --> 01:43.426
a-n-t...

01:44.770 --> 01:46.417
i-n-e.

01:47.898 --> 01:49.507
Quarantine.

01:49.611 --> 01:52.926
- You know the cholera?
- Yes, Mother.

01:53.030 --> 01:56.135
You've seen the signs on the houses
where the coloureds live?

01:56.240 --> 01:57.932
Yes, Mother.

01:58.036 --> 02:00.944
- You know the typhus?
- I do, Mother.

02:04.492 --> 02:07.233
You know what they can do to you?

02:07.337 --> 02:09.699
Yes, Mother.

02:12.708 --> 02:16.108
You are not safe.

02:22.176 --> 02:25.789
You may be directing this movie, Howard,
but what you're asking, we can't do it.

02:25.893 --> 02:28.668
Don't tell me I can't do it.
Don't tell me it can't be done.

02:28.772 --> 02:30.880
The gyro forces are too much here.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.655
You send these planes into simultaneous...

02:32.759 --> 02:36.465
It's the goddamn climax of the picture,
Frank, all right? You make it work.

02:36.569 --> 02:38.849
Look, decrease the vertical trajectory,
if you have to.

02:38.953 --> 02:41.723
A LeRhone rotary won't stall at 60 degrees,
I've done it.

02:41.827 --> 02:45.599
Howard, we're still short two cameras.
We need to cut that sequence down...

02:45.704 --> 02:48.087
We're not cutting anything, all right.
I'll get those extra cameras.

02:48.191 --> 02:48.984
Set up for rehearsals in five.

02:49.088 --> 02:51.820
Mr Hughes, I'm Noah Dietrich.
Your office said I might find you here.

02:51.924 --> 02:56.739
Dietrich. You're a man on the come. I read
your rÃ©sumÃ© and talked to your references.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.489
You know what I'm looking for?

02:58.594 --> 03:01.663
As I understand it, you're looking for
a second in command at Hughes Tools.

03:01.768 --> 03:04.579
Someone to help oversee
the financial aspects of the business.

03:04.683 --> 03:07.457
Yeah. I'm looking for somebody
to run it and do a damn good job.

03:07.561 --> 03:09.835
Look, there's really one thing
you've got to know.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.962
My folks, they're gone now,
so it's my money.

03:13.066 --> 03:15.302
Now, what I choose to do with
that money may seem crazy

03:15.406 --> 03:18.117
to those sons of bitches in Houston -
and I'm sure as hell it does -

03:18.222 --> 03:20.512
but it all makes good sense to me.
You got that?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.512
- Got it.
- Good.

03:22.617 --> 03:25.808
Now, you made, what,
$5,200 a year on your last job?

03:25.913 --> 03:28.270
I'll pay you 10,000.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.443
- Guess I'll be working twice as hard.
- You'll be working four times as hard.

03:31.547 --> 03:35.110
I just got you at half-price, Mr Dietrich.
Welcome aboard.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.053
You're my voice now.
Make 'em understand that.

03:37.157 --> 03:39.743
Look, some of those fine folks down there
still call me "Junior".

03:39.847 --> 03:42.992
- You tell them it's "Mr Hughes" now.
- You bet.

03:43.096 --> 03:46.747
- So, when do we go to Houston?
- We don't. Cholera epidemic in 1913.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.624
2,000 dead. Whole place is
nothing but pestilential swamp.

03:49.728 --> 03:54.045
Typhus, malaria, cholera, yellow fever -
you name it, they got it.

03:54.149 --> 03:56.545
You see that, Mr Dietrich?

03:56.650 --> 04:00.885
You are looking at the largest
private air force in the entire world.

04:00.989 --> 04:05.360
- What do you think of that, now?
- It's your money.

04:05.905 --> 04:08.505
Start 'em up.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.937
I just saw the rough cut of
the new Tod Browning movie,

05:37.042 --> 05:40.445
<i>London After Midnight.</i>
Lon Chaney is incredible.

05:40.549 --> 05:45.250
It's his best performance in a long time. It's
gonna be a big hit. The cards are great.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.495
Hello, Mr Mayer.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.705
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's Howard Hughes.

05:52.809 --> 05:55.167
I was wondering
if I could have a moment of your time.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.878
Yeah, Howard Hughes.
The airplane picture, right?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.423
- Exactly.
- Yeah, I remember.

05:59.528 --> 06:02.260
- <i>Hell's Angels.</i> You heard of it. Good.
- Yes.

06:02.364 --> 06:04.930
Listen, I was wondering
if I could have a moment of your time.

06:05.034 --> 06:07.510
I need a few cameras.

06:07.614 --> 06:09.308
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:09.413 --> 06:11.306
Two, to be exact.

06:11.410 --> 06:13.146
I already bought every camera I could find,

06:13.251 --> 06:15.336
but we're shooting
our big dogfight sequence this week

06:15.440 --> 06:19.104
and I need two more, desperately.
Do you think MGM could help me out?

06:19.209 --> 06:21.819
- With what?
- Cameras.

06:21.923 --> 06:26.874
With the actual cam... We're not usually in
the practice of helping out the competition.

06:28.047 --> 06:31.879
- How many cameras do you have now?
- 24.

06:35.471 --> 06:37.796
Wait a minute.

06:39.350 --> 06:41.003
- You have 24 cameras?
- That's right.

06:41.108 --> 06:44.010
- And you need two more?
- Yeah.

06:44.114 --> 06:47.717
- You don't think you got it with 24?
- No. No, sir.

06:47.822 --> 06:50.475
You know, I think we've got them all...

06:50.580 --> 06:53.055
Don't we have them all?
They're all used.

06:53.159 --> 06:55.519
- All 26 of them.
- I only need two, sir.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.647
- Jesus Christ, sonny...
- Howard.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.606
Howard.
Let me give you a little advice.

07:00.711 --> 07:03.107
- Why don't you take your oil money...
- Drill bits.

07:03.211 --> 07:06.237
Take your drill bit money,
and why don't you put it in the bank?

07:06.341 --> 07:08.848
Because if you continue making the movie
the way that you are,

07:08.952 --> 07:11.371
there isn't gonna be a distributor
who'll want to distribute it.

07:11.476 --> 07:14.078
You're not gonna find anybody
who wants to see the movie,

07:14.182 --> 07:17.168
and you're not gonna have
any more oil money.

07:17.272 --> 07:20.376
So, welcome to Hollywood.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.965
Yeah. Well, I'll be sure
to remember that, Mr Mayer.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.092
- Good luck.
- All right.

07:26.197 --> 07:29.355
He needs 26 to make it work?
He's out of his mind.

07:36.449 --> 07:40.363
I looked down at my pants.
It was a strange situation.

07:41.162 --> 07:42.162
Boss.

07:42.375 --> 07:46.489
Scram, love boat, let's go.
Another soda. You know what I mean.

07:46.593 --> 07:49.492
Milk, please, in the bottle.
With the cap still on.

07:49.596 --> 07:51.224
OK, Howard, what did "His Highness" say?

07:51.328 --> 07:54.592
The son of a bitch won't part with a single
goddamn camera. Can you believe it?

07:54.717 --> 07:57.996
Howard, why don't you try
and make do with what you have?

07:58.100 --> 08:02.418
What I have isn't enough, John.
Not for how I see it. Look.

08:02.522 --> 08:04.131
My name depends on this picture.

08:04.236 --> 08:06.906
If it doesn't work, I'm back to Houston
with my tail between my legs,

08:07.010 --> 08:09.510
making goddamn drill bits
for the rest of my life.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.911
Couldn't you find a way to do it
with the cameras you have?

08:12.015 --> 08:14.997
I mean, jeez, you ought to hear what's
going on with DeMille over at Paramount.

08:15.102 --> 08:17.771
He's shooting this Bible picture, right,
and he's gotta do a crucifixion.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.355
- Johnny.
- He's doing it in Fresno.

08:19.459 --> 08:21.316
- Johnny. Johnny.
- All of a sudden there's...

08:21.421 --> 08:22.900
- Johnny.
- Yeah?

08:23.004 --> 08:25.359
- You're a press agent, are you not?
- Yeah.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.863
And you're supposed to know all the little
ins and outs of Hollywood? Do you?

08:28.968 --> 08:34.243
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Then you leave the big ideas to me.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.256
- Yeah, of course, boss.
- Cigar, cigarettes, Sen-Sen?

08:38.302 --> 08:42.625
Thelma. I thought you were over at
the Brown Derby with Trixie. No, Theresa.

08:42.729 --> 08:45.503
- Margaret, yeah.
- Exactly. What happened to Margaret?

08:45.607 --> 08:48.132
- She lost her shoes?
- Thank God that's settled.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.636
I'm sorry.
Thelma, this is Howard Hughes.

08:51.740 --> 08:56.349
Howard and I were just discussing how he
wants me to pull a camera out of my ass.

08:56.454 --> 09:01.107
- Cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

09:02.284 --> 09:06.441
Whew. Boy, you are just hitting
on all six cylinders, aren't you?

09:06.545 --> 09:07.945
My God.

09:09.129 --> 09:11.361
Would you do me a favour and just...

09:11.465 --> 09:14.995
Would you just smile for me one time?
Just once?

09:17.049 --> 09:20.290
Whew. Yeah. Yeah.
You see, you got a short upper lip.

09:20.394 --> 09:23.671
Makes for a much nicer smile.

09:27.268 --> 09:31.008
See, I wonder what gives
a beautiful woman like you pleasure.

09:31.112 --> 09:34.845
I mean, say you're just standing there,
right? And I just touch you.

09:34.949 --> 09:38.932
Just like this,
through my fingertips.

09:39.037 --> 09:42.354
Do you...
Do you like that?

09:42.458 --> 09:43.858
Do you?

09:49.081 --> 09:53.072
See, I want to learn what pleases you.

09:53.176 --> 09:56.531
I want to learn everything about you.

09:56.636 --> 10:01.173
Would you let me do that?
Would you give me that job?

10:06.056 --> 10:08.049
I'm off in a half an hour.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.423
- Well, I'm in room...
- 217.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.328
217.

10:16.484 --> 10:19.188
See you there.

10:22.782 --> 10:25.145
Johnny, get on the horn
to Universal and Warner's.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.234
I need two more cameras by Saturday.
Rent 'em if you can.

10:28.338 --> 10:30.988
Steal 'em if you have to.

10:31.092 --> 10:34.747
Abso-tively, boss.
Abso-tively.

10:36.420 --> 10:39.412
Rumours coming from
a lonely airstrip out in Van Nuys.

10:39.516 --> 10:42.914
Sources whisper that young
Texas industrialist Howard Hughes

10:43.018 --> 10:46.750
just won't stop pouring money
into his war epic. And do we mean epic.

10:46.855 --> 10:52.879
137 pilots, 87 airplanes,
35 cameramen, 2,000 extras.

10:52.984 --> 10:56.315
How long will it be before this picture
ends up costing as much as the real war?

10:56.440 --> 10:59.515
Goddamn it.
Why the hell do they look so slow?

10:59.619 --> 11:05.862
This isn't what it was like up there. They
look like a bunch of goddamn models.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.788
Son of a bitch.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.525
Howard?

11:18.129 --> 11:22.074
Without something standing still
behind the planes

11:22.178 --> 11:24.660
we've got no idea of how fast we're moving.

11:24.764 --> 11:28.706
We got no sense of relative motion.

11:28.810 --> 11:31.420
Call over to UCLA.
Get me the best meteorologist they got.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.968
You get him here in an hour, all right?

11:37.273 --> 11:40.014
Hey. You want the good news
or the bad news?

11:40.118 --> 11:41.763
- The bad news, always.
- All right.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.891
We installed the 450 radial
but the struts won't take the vibration.

11:44.995 --> 11:49.228
Minute we fire her up, the struts
start cracking at the attach points.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.273
- Well, what's the good news?
- There isn't any.

11:52.377 --> 11:56.150
Goddamn it, Odie, if the 450's too big,
we just got to figure something else out.

11:56.254 --> 11:59.158
We've done everything.
We've rebuilt her from top to toe.

11:59.262 --> 12:03.032
Now, if we drain the fuel tank, for a couple
of runs, she might make 180mph.

12:03.136 --> 12:04.996
I want minimum 200, all right?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.730
I want a date with Theda Bara,
but that ain't gonna happen either.

12:07.834 --> 12:08.791
Don't be so sure.

12:08.895 --> 12:14.298
So if the struts won't sustain the engine
we need, we got to get rid of the struts.

12:14.403 --> 12:17.311
No, then the top wing falls off.

12:19.190 --> 12:21.176
Then let it.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.280
What?

12:23.699 --> 12:28.356
Who says we need a top wing?
I mean, who says we need anything?

12:30.534 --> 12:33.314
- A monoplane.
- A cantilevered monoplane, right.

12:33.418 --> 12:36.446
I mean, they're doing it in France.
To hell with the top wing and the struts.

12:36.551 --> 12:39.487
- Put in a 550 Wasp engine.
- 100 octane fuel.

12:39.591 --> 12:43.741
- That'd give us a top horsepower of what?
- 700.

12:43.845 --> 12:48.964
We squeeze that to a thousand,
we've got the fastest plane ever built.

12:50.846 --> 12:57.134
You know, I just got to say we've already
spent over $ 200,000 rebuilding this plane.

12:57.728 --> 13:00.387
To hell with it.

13:00.491 --> 13:03.517
Tear it up, Odie.
Go on.

13:06.862 --> 13:07.862
Well.

13:09.452 --> 13:15.035
The cumulonimbus formations
about which you speak...

13:16.372 --> 13:18.525
that look like...

13:18.629 --> 13:22.403
Giant breasts full of milk.
I want clouds, damn it.

13:22.507 --> 13:28.413
Yes, clouds that look like
giant breasts full of milk

13:28.517 --> 13:32.249
cannot exactly be guaranteed
for any particular occasion.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.718
So you might have to...

13:35.599 --> 13:37.199
to wait.

13:39.061 --> 13:41.924
Then we'll wait.

13:42.029 --> 13:46.474
Look, whatever they pay you at UCLA, I'm
doubling it, all right? You work for me now.

13:46.578 --> 13:49.766
Find some clouds.

13:49.870 --> 13:53.438
Find some clouds.
Find me some clouds.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.025
Welcome to <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

13:59.123 --> 14:00.238
Thank you.

14:10.009 --> 14:13.416
We've been to Chatsworth, Santa Cruz,
Encino, San Diego, Riverside,

14:13.521 --> 14:16.337
Van Nuys and Bakersfield.
It has been eight months.

14:16.441 --> 14:20.883
- Where are my goddamn clouds?
- They move, Mr Hughes.

14:20.987 --> 14:24.469
Clouds move.
That's what they do. They move.

14:24.573 --> 14:30.514
See that? It is costing me $5,271 a day
to keep those planes on the ground.

14:30.618 --> 14:34.361
You find me some goddamn clouds.

14:40.831 --> 14:42.631
Nice day.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.861
Yeah, very funny.

14:44.966 --> 14:47.974
Listen, I got a call from Houston.
They're getting real nervous about all this.

14:48.078 --> 14:51.326
- Stop showing them the damn bills, Noah.
- That would be illegal, Howard.

14:51.430 --> 14:53.994
Shit, no.
Maybe it's a little bit naughty.

14:54.099 --> 14:59.294
Hughes Tools is incorporated in Texas.
They have to see the bills.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.799
Incorporate a new division out here,
all right? We'll call it Hughes Aircraft.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.464
Odie, do we need
these rivets on the cowling?

15:05.568 --> 15:07.679
Yeah, or the reverse thrust would rip it off.

15:07.783 --> 15:10.177
They're gonna give me drag.
Do something about that, OK?

15:10.282 --> 15:12.623
- Wind resistance on the rivets?
- Yeah, I want her slippery.

15:12.728 --> 15:15.727
There are serious tax consequences
to incorporating in California.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.899
- Just take care of it, would you?
- Mr Hughes. Mr Hughes.

15:19.004 --> 15:23.279
Oakland.
We have clouds in Oakland.

15:23.383 --> 15:25.654
- You mean it this time?
- Yes.

15:25.758 --> 15:30.452
Goddamn it, yes. I can promise you.
Clouds in Oakland.

15:30.556 --> 15:32.435
All right, all right,
don't get all jittery now.

15:32.539 --> 15:35.939
Oakland.
Oakland.

15:36.768 --> 15:41.056
We're going to Oakland.
Oakland.

16:16.427 --> 16:18.918
Down and to the left.

16:42.244 --> 16:45.494
That was perfect.

16:52.421 --> 16:55.080
Yes, young Howard Hughes
has pulled it off.

16:55.184 --> 16:58.748
After two years, <i>Hell's Angels</i>
has finally finished filming.

16:58.853 --> 17:01.791
There's going to be one heck
of a wrap party in Hollywood tonight.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.880
The price tag?
A staggering $ 2 million.

17:04.984 --> 17:07.377
So, if every human being
in America buys a ticket,

17:07.482 --> 17:09.387
heck, he might
even make a profit.

17:14.401 --> 17:18.347
First the clouds don't come, then the
planes break down, then the planes crash.

17:18.451 --> 17:20.101
Then the Zeppelins don't work.

17:20.204 --> 17:23.066
Seems we've had everything but
a damn plague of locusts on this thing.

17:23.171 --> 17:24.605
I mean, you have to admit.

17:24.710 --> 17:30.493
Now, honestly, did you ever think
you'd actually finish the damn thing?

17:30.918 --> 17:32.460
Come with me.

17:34.130 --> 17:37.743
Mama, darling,
if I'm a success in this show,

17:37.847 --> 17:39.844
- well, we're going to move from here.
- Oh, no.

17:39.969 --> 17:42.000
Oh, yes.
We're gonna move up in the Bronx.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.609
Lot of nice green grass up there
and a whole lot of people you know.

17:44.713 --> 17:47.087
There's the Ginsbergs,
the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.019
A whole lot of bergs.
I don't know them all.

17:50.437 --> 17:54.383
You see, this is what the people want.
Silent pictures are yesterday's news.

17:54.487 --> 17:58.101
So I figure we gotta reshoot
<i>Hell's Angels</i> for sound.

17:59.738 --> 18:02.647
- How much of it?
- All of it.

18:02.751 --> 18:07.897
Before you even ask, I'll tell you. An
additional 1.7 million. We got that much?

18:08.001 --> 18:11.237
- No.
- Well, we'll make it.

18:11.342 --> 18:13.365
Take care of that, would you?

18:13.469 --> 18:14.659
Now get this.

18:24.972 --> 18:29.173
In the halls of 7000 Romaine, it goes on
day after day, month after month.

18:29.277 --> 18:33.135
Howard Hughes is now editing
some 25 miles of film.

18:34.899 --> 18:39.516
Heck, I say release it now and give
the world its first 560-hour movie.

18:39.620 --> 18:44.683
Pat. Mr Hughes needs this reel
in the projection room right now.

18:44.788 --> 18:46.482
Enough is enough, Mr Hughes.

18:46.586 --> 18:49.690
Are you ever gonna let us actually see
this little epic of yours?

18:49.795 --> 18:51.595
Hurry up.

19:12.311 --> 19:13.759
- Who is it?
- Noah.

19:13.864 --> 19:15.930
Come on in.

19:17.149 --> 19:19.485
I've been on the phone to Houston
for three solid hours.

19:19.610 --> 19:21.513
We're fixing every goddamn book we have.

19:21.617 --> 19:23.810
Wait, wait, wait.

19:23.914 --> 19:27.314
Yeah. Run reel ten again.
I think we're duplicating a shot here.

19:27.418 --> 19:31.233
And tell Jimmy I want
ten chocolate chip cookies, all right?

19:31.337 --> 19:35.031
Medium chips,
none too close to the outside. Got it?

19:36.043 --> 19:38.529
Do you remember
that goddamn shot from reel ten?

19:38.633 --> 19:43.662
No. I don't remember anything from
reel ten. I don't know what reel ten is.

19:43.766 --> 19:47.000
I'm a businessman, Howard,
and so are you.

19:47.104 --> 19:48.916
Now, look.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.960
This has been a great ride.
We've had a hell of a lot of fun.

19:53.064 --> 19:56.922
But you're losing
$ 25,000 a day doing this.

19:57.027 --> 19:59.027
Every day.

20:04.655 --> 20:07.442
So, what are my options?

20:09.034 --> 20:11.693
Well, this time I don't know
that you have any.

20:11.798 --> 20:14.862
I'm afraid you got to close it down.

20:14.966 --> 20:16.700
Dig your way out.

20:23.257 --> 20:25.788
I'm sorry, Howard.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.092
I truly am.

20:35.060 --> 20:38.429
Reel ten, Mr Hughes.

20:42.693 --> 20:45.556
Mortgage Toolco.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.974
Every asset.

20:48.079 --> 20:50.771
- You heard me.
- If you do that, you could lose everything.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.944
Well, I won't.

20:55.581 --> 20:57.181
I won't.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.344
All right.

21:01.545 --> 21:03.289
I'll get into it.

21:04.548 --> 21:06.707
Thanks, Noah.

21:41.252 --> 21:44.947
More than half a million good souls
lining the curb of Hollywood Boulevard.

21:45.051 --> 21:46.914
Look at the automobiles,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:47.018 --> 21:50.290
There are at least 45,000 cars here,
making it the greatest traffic jam...

21:50.394 --> 21:53.461
Young Howard Hughes must have
quite a lump in his throat tonight.

21:53.565 --> 21:57.590
Six months after the stock market crashes
and after the death of three of his pilots,

21:57.694 --> 22:00.798
he's finally unveiling
his $4-million baby doll.

22:00.903 --> 22:05.264
It's the most expensive movie ever.
Nothing five-and-dime for our Mr Hughes.

22:05.368 --> 22:07.474
Nothing like tonight
has ever been seen before,

22:07.578 --> 22:10.600
and I can certainly say
it will never be seen again.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.644
500,000 people are crowding the streets
to get a glimpse

22:13.749 --> 22:17.317
of the stars and celebrities.
Three companies of Marines were called

22:17.421 --> 22:21.236
to assist the 250 special police
who are handling this enormous crowd.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.904
This is an industry town, my friends,

22:23.008 --> 22:26.326
and nobody, but nobody,
makes a movie outside a studio.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.908
Sure, some Hollywood insiders
over at the Brown Derby...

22:29.012 --> 22:31.161
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I think...

22:31.265 --> 22:34.374
Yes, yes. I can just see
Mr Hughes's car arriving now.

22:34.478 --> 22:38.212
Mr Hughes escorts
the lovely starlet Jean Harlow tonight.

22:38.316 --> 22:41.965
He discovered her for this picture,
and we think her platinum-blonde locks

22:42.070 --> 22:46.724
and hot-jazz, baby-doll style
are gonna make her a big star.

23:11.842 --> 23:13.035
Mr Hughes.

23:13.139 --> 23:16.498
Mr Hughes, how about a word?

23:16.602 --> 23:21.048
Big night for you, Mr Hughes.

23:21.153 --> 23:24.051
Big night for you tonight.

23:24.156 --> 23:26.261
Very big.
Very big.

23:26.365 --> 23:30.485
Tell us what it was like
making this fabulous picture.

23:31.987 --> 23:32.787
Yes.

23:33.874 --> 23:34.874
Yeah.

23:35.417 --> 23:41.197
So, four million clams from your own
pocket. Nervous how the flick will fly?

23:43.415 --> 23:47.239
Big night.
You enjoy the show.

23:47.343 --> 23:52.830
Yes, well, let me present the feminine star
of this spectacle, <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

23:52.934 --> 23:55.411
- Miss Jean Harlow.
- Thank you.

23:55.515 --> 23:58.708
I would like to use this occasion
to publicly thank Mr Hughes

23:58.812 --> 24:02.335
for the opportunity he gave me.
Thank you.

24:02.440 --> 24:06.297
Thank you. And now
I'd like to ask Roscoe Arbuckle

24:06.401 --> 24:08.761
to introduce his pet lion cub, Gilmore.

24:08.865 --> 24:11.329
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you remember my name?

24:11.433 --> 24:15.731
I'm sorry. Roscoe Turner.
And this would be Gilmore.

24:58.783 --> 25:00.526
We've got him.
We've got him.

25:02.119 --> 25:05.316
Murder. That's what
this dirty rotten politician war is.

25:05.420 --> 25:07.288
Murder. You know it as well as I do.

25:45.037 --> 25:47.706
Stand up, Slim, take a bow.

26:00.177 --> 26:02.292
Reel four played way too long.
Too many coughs.

26:02.396 --> 26:04.984
Get Harry and the team out of the party,
get them over to the office.

26:05.088 --> 26:06.377
I want to cut a few shots tonight.

26:06.481 --> 26:10.299
Find Glenn Odekirk. Somebody write
this down. "Flush rivets." You got that?

26:10.403 --> 26:12.260
- Flush rivets.
- Flush rivets.

26:12.364 --> 26:14.055
Lickety split, boss.

26:14.159 --> 26:16.226
Here he is.

26:17.862 --> 26:20.264
<i>Variety</i> says,
"This one won't miss."

26:20.368 --> 26:22.644
Magnificently photographed...

26:22.749 --> 26:26.188
Scenes that never
have been approached...

26:26.292 --> 26:29.611
Not for a long time have I seen
anything as enthralling...

26:29.715 --> 26:34.665
It cost four million dollars
and it has four million thrills...

27:31.185 --> 27:37.057
The lighter shade. I don't want to look like
Boris Karloff, if you know what I mean.

27:38.108 --> 27:42.016
I read in the magazines
that you play golf.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.811
On occasion.

27:43.915 --> 27:46.397
Well, how about nine holes?

27:48.160 --> 27:50.940
Now, Mr Hughes?

27:51.044 --> 27:54.074
If it would be convenient, Miss Hepburn.

28:16.230 --> 28:19.760
You're not extending enough
on your follow-through.

28:19.864 --> 28:23.099
Follow-through is everything in golf,
just like life. Ha-ha-ha.

28:23.204 --> 28:24.350
Don't you find?

28:24.454 --> 28:26.516
Saw your <i>Scarface</i> picture.

28:26.621 --> 28:28.436
- Violent.
- Realistic.

28:28.540 --> 28:33.772
Movies are movies, Howard, not life.
Now, the stage - the stage is real.

28:33.877 --> 28:38.074
Real flesh and blood. Human beings
right up there in front of you, buster.

28:38.178 --> 28:41.282
Can't look away.
Can't munch popcorn. That would be rude.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.244
- Do you like the theatre?
- No.

28:43.349 --> 28:45.538
I adore the theatre.

28:45.643 --> 28:47.832
Only alive on stage.
I'll teach you.

28:47.937 --> 28:51.963
We'll see some Ibsen, if the Republicans
haven't outlawed him by now. Ha-ha.

28:52.067 --> 28:55.196
You're not a Republican, are you? Couldn't
abide that. How did you vote in '32?

28:55.300 --> 28:59.391
- Well, I didn't.
- You must. It's your sacred franchise.

29:02.234 --> 29:05.392
Heard you were wooing Ginger Rogers.
What about that?

29:05.496 --> 29:07.225
Aw, she's just a friend.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.937
Ha. Men can't be friends
with women, Howard.

29:10.041 --> 29:13.979
They must possess them or leave them be.
It's a primitive urge from caveman days.

29:14.084 --> 29:17.359
It's all in Darwin.
Hunt the flesh, kill the flesh, eat the flesh.

29:17.463 --> 29:21.320
That's the male sex all over.

29:21.424 --> 29:23.424
Excuse me?

29:23.594 --> 29:28.744
Well, if you're deaf you must own up to it.
Get a hearing aid, or see my father.

29:28.848 --> 29:32.540
He's a urologist, but it's all tied up
inside the body, don't you find?

29:32.644 --> 29:36.796
Me, I keep healthy.
I take seven showers a day to keep clean.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.589
Also because I am what's so
vulgarly referred to as "outdoorsy".

29:40.694 --> 29:44.552
Well, I'm not "outdoorsy".
I'm athletic. I sweat.

29:44.656 --> 29:47.432
There it is.
Now we both know the sordid truth.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.060
I sweat and you're deaf.

29:50.165 --> 29:53.526
Aren't we a fine pair of misfits?

29:56.622 --> 29:57.822
Three.

30:05.965 --> 30:08.041
Noble effort.

30:10.094 --> 30:13.373
So I suppose you're wooing me now.

30:13.477 --> 30:15.277
Oh, well.

30:34.493 --> 30:39.693
Not enough. Not enough.
These rivets have to be completely flush.

30:39.797 --> 30:42.948
I want every screw and joint countersunk.

30:43.052 --> 30:45.741
I want no wind resistance on the fuselage.

30:45.845 --> 30:49.162
She has got to be clean, Odie.
Clean. Understand?

30:49.266 --> 30:52.998
- OK, Howard.
- I don't know what else to tell you.

30:53.102 --> 30:54.333
What have you got for me?

30:54.437 --> 30:58.004
The thing is, TWA needs a new plane.
A modern plane.

30:58.108 --> 31:00.337
- Yeah? What kind of plane?
- OK.

31:00.441 --> 31:03.760
The DC-3 has 21 daytime seats
and 14 overnight berths.

31:03.864 --> 31:06.258
- Something bigger.
- Try 50 seats.

31:06.363 --> 31:09.389
- With a ceiling of 12,000 feet.
- No.

31:09.493 --> 31:13.227
20,000. Think about it, Jack.
What does 20,000 feet give you?

31:13.331 --> 31:15.774
- Less turbulence.
- Right, because it's above the weather.

31:15.878 --> 31:18.482
Jack, we want to fly above the weather.

31:18.586 --> 31:22.155
Only 1 per cent of the American population
has ever set foot on a commercial airliner.

31:22.260 --> 31:25.241
Why? Because they're scared to death,
Jack, and they should be.

31:25.345 --> 31:28.033
I mean, 7,000 feet is bumpy as shit.
You know that.

31:28.137 --> 31:30.661
We build a plane
that flies above the weather,

31:30.765 --> 31:34.620
we could get every man, woman and child
in this country to feel safe up there.

31:34.724 --> 31:37.877
An airplane with the ability
to fly in the substratosphere.

31:37.982 --> 31:41.253
Across the country.
Across the world.

31:41.357 --> 31:43.754
Now, that is the future.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.092
- You with me?
- Yeah.

31:45.196 --> 31:47.410
Shoot straight with me now,
cos I don't wanna get into all this

31:47.514 --> 31:49.261
if your board doesn't have the balls for it.

31:49.365 --> 31:52.019
- Would they support us?
- I don't know. They're tight bastards.

31:52.123 --> 31:54.146
- Well, what's your financial picture?
- Not great.

31:54.250 --> 31:56.354
- Last year's deficit?
- 770,000.

31:56.459 --> 31:59.064
- What's it selling at?
- About eight dollars a share.

31:59.169 --> 32:02.985
That's the lowest it's been.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.529
- I could do that.
- Do what?

32:05.633 --> 32:07.863
- Buy it.
- You want to buy the airline?

32:07.967 --> 32:10.787
For crying out loud, Jack. We don't want
a bunch of damn pencil-pushers

32:10.892 --> 32:13.287
getting in the way
of us making our plane, do we?

32:13.391 --> 32:18.206
Give me brass tacks, now. What does
controlling interest in TWA cost me?

32:18.311 --> 32:21.962
- Call it 15 million.
- Whew.

32:22.066 --> 32:25.013
- That is a chunk of change.
- Yeah.

32:27.773 --> 32:31.846
You call Noah Dietrich.
You have him start buying.

32:31.950 --> 32:36.267
Howard, hold on. Are you sure? You want
to think about it for five minutes?

32:36.371 --> 32:40.363
Hell, Jack, I've got a tiger by the tail here,
and I ain't gonna let it go.

32:49.170 --> 32:54.453
Good evening, Mr Hughes.
Welcome. Your table is ready.

32:54.557 --> 32:57.580
- How goes the aviation, Mr Hughes?
- Just fine, Pete.

32:57.684 --> 33:00.050
I'm so glad.

33:01.599 --> 33:04.340
- Good evening, Mr Hughes. Madame.
- It's "Miss".

33:04.444 --> 33:07.881
- Miss. The usual, Mr Hughes?
- Please, yes.

33:07.985 --> 33:10.427
And may I recommend for the lady
our clementine soup,

33:10.532 --> 33:14.431
followed by roast wild duck with currant
glaze and poached pears in rose sauce?

33:14.536 --> 33:17.731
- It's truly divine.
- Yeah. That sounds fine.

33:19.700 --> 33:23.562
Your kind of a joint, is it?

33:23.667 --> 33:26.110
- Wouldn't have thought.
- They're open late.

33:26.214 --> 33:30.069
I go to a hot dog stand on La Cienega, too.
They're open till about four.

33:30.173 --> 33:31.973
Are they?

33:33.464 --> 33:35.919
How marvellous.

33:51.148 --> 33:54.140
Howard. Howard.

33:54.244 --> 33:56.598
Hi. Son of a gun.

33:56.703 --> 34:00.602
Kate, this is Johnny Meyer. I suppose
you could call him my press agent.

34:00.707 --> 34:02.420
Pleased to meet you.
Loved you in <i>Alice Adams.</i>

34:02.524 --> 34:04.314
- You're too kind.
- I'm sure you know Errol, right?

34:04.419 --> 34:07.153
- Mr Flynn. Yes.
- Kate. Kate.

34:07.257 --> 34:11.320
Kate of the clenched-jawed Hepburns.
Enchanting as always.

34:11.425 --> 34:13.782
You should use Lux on your hands,
by the way. I do.

34:13.887 --> 34:17.080
Kate, sweetie, you and Howard ought
to cook up a picture. Co-star with Errol...

34:17.185 --> 34:18.751
My chair.

34:22.304 --> 34:25.667
I think not.
Don't you read <i>Variety.</i> Mr Meyer?

34:25.771 --> 34:29.422
I'm box-office poison.
I'm on the outs, the skids, the doldrums.

34:29.527 --> 34:33.260
Washed up, day-old fish
not worth the eating, so they tell me.

34:33.364 --> 34:36.887
To hell with them. To hell with them,
my dear. Soulless pricks to a man, right?

34:36.991 --> 34:43.273
Johnny tells me you're thinking about
doing a Western, of all goddamn things.

34:45.286 --> 34:48.065
Are you making a Western, Howard?

34:48.170 --> 34:50.777
Yeah. Making a Western.
I'm gonna call it <i>The Outlaw.</i>

34:50.882 --> 34:55.114
Yeah. And you know what it's about?
S-e-x. It's all about s-e-x.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.949
It's a Western.

34:57.054 --> 35:01.204
- You can't have fornication in a Western.
- It's not real sex, Skinny. It's movie sex.

35:01.308 --> 35:05.042
What <i>Scarface</i> did for the gangster picture,
<i>The Outlaw</i> is gonna do for the Western.

35:05.146 --> 35:08.086
Put the sex and guts and blood
right up there on the screen...

35:08.190 --> 35:10.298
- Have any cigarettes?
- Don't mind us.

35:10.402 --> 35:13.840
New York-cut steak, 12 peas,
bottle of milk with the cap on.

35:13.945 --> 35:17.219
You're the only movie star I know
can't afford his own goddamn cigarettes.

35:17.323 --> 35:21.686
I hope your food isn't getting cold over
at your table somewhere, or something.

35:21.790 --> 35:24.183
No, no, no. We're here all night.
Don't worry.

35:24.287 --> 35:27.857
Now, Howard.
Now, Howard, Howard. Howard.

35:27.962 --> 35:31.361
If you're seriously talking about putting
carnality back on the silver screen,

35:31.465 --> 35:36.035
you must swear to let me in
on the casting sessions.

35:37.922 --> 35:41.119
I've somewhat of an eye -
an eye for talent, isn't that right, Johnny?

35:41.223 --> 35:43.792
You ought to give up that prancing
in tights, be a talent scout.

35:43.896 --> 35:48.087
That prancing in tights paid for my new
yacht. You must all come sailing with me.

35:48.191 --> 35:49.756
Catalina, this weekend.
What do you say?

35:49.861 --> 35:52.087
- Yeah, Catalina. Sounds grand.
- Let's have some fun.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.845
I've even managed to coax
the luscious Miss de Havilland

35:54.949 --> 35:57.219
and her equally luscious sister
to accompany me.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.537
Though I fear their mother
will insist on coming along

35:59.641 --> 36:02.141
to preserve their questionable virtue.

36:02.245 --> 36:06.938
We shall assault these twin monuments
of pristine Britannic beauty nonetheless.

36:07.042 --> 36:09.187
- What do you say, Howard?
- Yeah?

36:09.292 --> 36:10.690
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:10.794 --> 36:11.794
Yeah.

36:16.127 --> 36:18.447
I gotta... I gotta go.

36:18.551 --> 36:21.743
If you'll excuse us,
we have to be somewhere.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.620
You are somewhere, Howard,
you madman.

36:24.725 --> 36:27.749
- Somewhere else. Excuse us.
- Charmed, gentlemen.

36:27.853 --> 36:32.131
Do help yourself to the poached pears.
I hear they're divine.

36:32.235 --> 36:35.756
Well. Howard Hughes,
ladies and gentlemen.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.176
Was that meant for me?

36:37.280 --> 36:40.719
My hero.
God, all that Hollywood talk bores me silly.

36:40.823 --> 36:43.852
As if there aren't more important things
in the world. Mussolini, for one.

36:43.956 --> 36:48.022
- Where are we going, by the way?
- Do you feel like a little adventure?

36:48.126 --> 36:50.148
Do your worst, Mr Hughes.

36:50.252 --> 36:51.520
...you limey bastard.

36:51.625 --> 36:54.484
I'm a Tasmanian bastard,
you ignorant prick.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.658
That a way, Errol.

37:30.534 --> 37:33.314
That's Mr Mayer's house right there.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.698
Do you know where Jack Warner lives?

37:44.632 --> 37:48.494
- What's that on the steering wheel?
- Cellophane.

37:48.598 --> 37:52.878
If you had any idea of the crap
that people carry around on their hands...

37:52.983 --> 37:55.293
What kind of crap?

37:55.398 --> 37:57.599
You don't want to know.

38:02.233 --> 38:05.103
Hold onto the wheel for a bit.

38:12.409 --> 38:14.651
That's too hard.
Relax your hand. Relax your hand.

38:21.127 --> 38:26.282
You see, you've got to feel the vibration
of the engine through your fingertips.

38:26.386 --> 38:29.745
- Feel that?
- Yes.

38:29.849 --> 38:30.849
Yeah.

38:31.979 --> 38:34.169
Well, that's good.

38:34.273 --> 38:35.473
Golly.

38:40.437 --> 38:42.340
Well, she's all yours.

38:42.445 --> 38:46.929
- Where are you going?
- I think there's some milk back here.

38:47.034 --> 38:50.942
- You just keep us steady now.
- All right.

39:08.966 --> 39:10.748
- Howard.
- Yeah?

39:10.852 --> 39:13.245
There's a rather alarming mountain
heading our way.

39:13.350 --> 39:16.216
Pull back on the wheel a smidge.
Go on.

39:20.811 --> 39:22.011
Golly.

39:29.361 --> 39:35.067
I don't think I've ever met someone
who actually uses the word "golly".

39:41.457 --> 39:43.737
You all right?
Do you want me to take over?

39:43.842 --> 39:47.702
Just when I'm getting the hang of it?

39:51.509 --> 39:55.458
- You... You want some milk?
- Please.

40:17.159 --> 40:21.066
Utterly smashing.
We'll do it again. I'm free Wednesday.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.030
It's a little early for golf, though,
don't you think?

40:23.134 --> 40:25.489
Oh, no. I live right there.

40:25.594 --> 40:28.419
- Feel like a drink?
- Lead on.

40:29.463 --> 40:32.993
Now, that makes
for a challenging par four.

40:33.097 --> 40:37.209
My decorator picked out
the wallpaper and such.

40:37.314 --> 40:42.421
He's queer as a bed bug, but...
I just hate this room.

40:42.525 --> 40:44.755
Gives me the willies. Ugh.

40:44.859 --> 40:49.017
Feel I'm about to be swallowed up
by the latest issue of <i>Town & Country.</i>

40:57.575 --> 41:00.605
What room do you like?

41:00.709 --> 41:02.509
My study.

41:04.457 --> 41:06.533
Take me there.

41:22.641 --> 41:26.382
You are the tallest woman I know.

41:26.486 --> 41:29.093
And all sharp elbows and knees.

41:29.197 --> 41:30.597
Beware.

41:53.172 --> 41:56.208
Will you fly me to work tomorrow?

41:58.803 --> 42:01.638
It is tomorrow.

42:53.566 --> 42:55.264
Keep your eye on the fuel gauge.

42:55.368 --> 42:58.972
She's got a minimum of fuel to keep
her weight down. Two runs, that's it.

42:59.076 --> 43:02.126
After that, you're flying on vapours.
And then you crash and then you die.

43:02.231 --> 43:03.898
- Right.
- Just give her easy flying.

43:04.002 --> 43:06.856
Don't worry about speed.
And don't think about the record today.

43:06.960 --> 43:10.301
I wish to God you'd let someone else take
her up. You've got damn 20 test pilots...

43:10.405 --> 43:13.366
Hell, why should I let
someone else have all the fun?

43:13.470 --> 43:16.248
See you in a bit.

43:36.275 --> 43:37.875
Contact.

45:05.614 --> 45:07.414
Whoo-hoo.

45:07.750 --> 45:08.550
339.

45:10.911 --> 45:12.074
Goddamn.

45:34.518 --> 45:35.318
347.

45:36.654 --> 45:38.887
Whoo.
Son of a bitch.

46:11.347 --> 46:13.947
- 352.
- 352.

46:15.100 --> 46:16.345
Good girl.

46:25.945 --> 46:27.545
Damn it.

46:31.450 --> 46:34.647
Goddamn it.
Oh, God.

46:34.751 --> 46:38.244
- There goes our meal ticket.
- Come on.

47:18.122 --> 47:20.402
Howard. Howard.

47:20.507 --> 47:22.946
How did we do?

47:23.051 --> 47:26.989
352 on the last run.

47:27.093 --> 47:28.797
She'll go faster.

47:29.300 --> 47:31.580
Country mouse.

47:31.684 --> 47:33.164
Kate. Katie.

47:33.268 --> 47:35.338
Upstairs, city mouse.

47:38.017 --> 47:39.217
Hello.

47:39.486 --> 47:43.716
- Good Lord, what happened to you?
- Nothing. Hard landing. I cut my foot.

47:43.820 --> 47:46.677
Sit down. I'll take care of it.
You tell me everything.

47:46.782 --> 47:50.516
Well, you cannot imagine what it was like,
Katie. You cannot imagine the speed.

47:50.620 --> 47:52.682
She was like a winged bullet up there.

47:52.787 --> 47:56.854
- What did she make?
- Around...

47:56.959 --> 47:57.759
352.

48:05.377 --> 48:07.577
You did it.

48:08.141 --> 48:10.078
Fastest man on the planet.

48:10.182 --> 48:14.625
- Hot dog. I'm so proud of you.
- She did it, baby.

48:14.729 --> 48:18.255
- You knew she would.
- She was fine. She was just fine.

48:20.392 --> 48:22.848
- Now let me see your foot.
- Yeah.

48:23.813 --> 48:25.595
Good God.
You're covered in blood.

48:25.699 --> 48:28.886
No, no. That's just beet juice.
I crashed into a beet field.

48:28.991 --> 48:32.816
- What?
- Yeah, I crashed in a beet field.

48:35.324 --> 48:38.232
Let me get you cleaned up.

48:38.336 --> 48:40.442
Heavens, what is this?
Electrical tape?

48:40.546 --> 48:43.900
Yeah. Odie just sort of slammed it on there.

48:44.005 --> 48:50.038
But all I could think about was
getting home to see you.

48:53.676 --> 48:57.294
I am so proud of you.

49:01.100 --> 49:03.170
Now, this is going to sting a little bit.

49:03.274 --> 49:07.681
This is useless. Come to the bathroom.

49:08.732 --> 49:11.512
- Don't get beet juice on the carpet.
- I won't.

49:11.617 --> 49:14.445
- Too hot.
- Don't be a baby.

49:16.073 --> 49:19.648
Was the press there?

49:19.752 --> 49:22.152
Some, but...

49:23.080 --> 49:27.623
They're calling everyone.
Should be on the wires by now.

49:34.967 --> 49:37.167
What is it?

49:39.388 --> 49:40.388
Kate?

49:44.101 --> 49:47.631
I've been famous,
for better or worse,

49:47.735 --> 49:50.565
for a long time now, and...

49:52.026 --> 49:56.735
I wonder if you know
what it really means.

49:57.823 --> 50:01.647
Yeah. I had my fair share
of press on <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

50:01.751 --> 50:04.116
I'm used to it.

50:05.456 --> 50:07.056
Are you?

50:10.836 --> 50:12.912
Howard, we're...

50:15.549 --> 50:18.301
We're not like everyone else.

50:20.054 --> 50:25.631
Too many acute angles.
Too many eccentricities.

50:25.736 --> 50:30.965
We have to be very careful
not to let people in,

50:31.069 --> 50:34.019
or they'll make us into freaks.

50:34.985 --> 50:35.985
Kate.

50:37.037 --> 50:39.976
They can't get in here.
We're safe.

50:40.080 --> 50:43.110
They can always get in.

50:45.287 --> 50:48.739
When my brother killed himself,

50:49.792 --> 50:53.405
there were photographers at the funeral.

50:53.509 --> 50:56.421
There's no decency to it.

51:08.394 --> 51:10.303
You know, sometimes I...

51:13.983 --> 51:16.604
I get these feelings, Katie.

51:21.157 --> 51:24.027
I get these ideas, these...

51:26.579 --> 51:28.951
crazy ideas about...

51:31.500 --> 51:34.252
things that may not...

51:35.296 --> 51:38.658
things that may not really be there.

51:38.763 --> 51:39.763
Yeah.

51:46.974 --> 51:50.260
Sometimes I truly fear that I'm...

51:51.729 --> 51:54.729
losing my mind.

52:01.363 --> 52:03.854
And if I did, it would...

52:06.327 --> 52:09.244
It'd be like flying blind.

52:16.962 --> 52:19.962
You understand?

52:22.676 --> 52:25.796
You taught me to fly, Howard.

52:28.474 --> 52:30.965
I'll take the wheel.

52:46.158 --> 52:50.443
Smashing all records, Howard Hughes
outdoes Jules Verne's wildest dreams.

52:50.547 --> 52:53.695
Around the world from New York
to New York in four days,

52:53.799 --> 52:57.115
even beating Wiley Post's mark
by over three days.

52:57.219 --> 52:58.826
New aviation history is written

52:58.930 --> 53:02.661
when his Lockheed monoplane
returns swiftly and safely.

53:02.765 --> 53:06.831
A daring aviator.
A true pioneer of the world's airways.

53:06.935 --> 53:09.709
From New York to Paris,
he cuts Lindbergh's time in half.

53:09.813 --> 53:11.128
Then on to Moscow.

53:11.232 --> 53:15.759
35 hours out of New York, he roars
across Siberia's trackless wastes.

53:15.863 --> 53:20.472
60 hours out of New York, he heads
for Alaska, most hazardous hop of all.

53:20.576 --> 53:23.098
Continuing the terrific pace,
he comes home,

53:23.203 --> 53:25.681
bringing new laurels
to American aviation.

53:25.785 --> 53:30.194
Howard Hughes and his crew may find
more worlds to conq...

53:36.750 --> 53:39.138
You're not gonna believe this.
It just came across the wires.

53:39.243 --> 53:42.704
Howard Hughes
has bought control of TWA.

53:44.300 --> 53:47.208
I thought Mr Hughes
was flying around the world.

53:47.312 --> 53:52.297
Apparently, he did it while he was flying,
over the radio.

53:58.022 --> 54:02.806
I have heard some disquieting rumours
about Mr Hughes.

54:02.910 --> 54:07.611
I'd like to know everything
there is to know about Mr Hughes.

54:08.657 --> 54:12.869
I'd like you to attend
to that for me, thoroughly.

54:13.996 --> 54:16.610
Ah, the Pantages is glittering tonight.

54:16.714 --> 54:18.970
Right over here, Mr Hughes.
This way, over to the left.

54:19.074 --> 54:21.074
Mr Hughes. Mr Hughes,
how was your flight?

54:21.178 --> 54:23.558
Miss Hepburn, Miss Hepburn.
When are you gonna name the day?

54:23.662 --> 54:27.538
- Right over here, Mr Hughes.
- What's your next movie, Howard?

54:27.642 --> 54:31.248
Right here, Howard. How many more
records are you gonna set?

54:31.352 --> 54:35.292
Come on, Howard.
Give us a smile. It won't kill you.

54:35.397 --> 54:37.467
- Raise your head a little.
- Over here. Over here.

54:37.572 --> 54:39.218
Don't forget this side.

54:39.322 --> 54:41.471
Mr Hughes, when are you
gonna fly round the world again?

54:41.576 --> 54:45.433
You going to fly with Kate next time?
Did you get Ionely without her?

54:45.537 --> 54:47.978
Did you talk to Lindbergh
about your round-the-world flight yet?

54:48.082 --> 54:50.893
Mr Hughes,
where is Linda Darnell tonight?

54:50.998 --> 54:53.145
Right here.
Right here, Mr Hughes. That's it.

54:53.249 --> 54:56.484
Are you trying to be
more famous than Lindbergh?

54:56.589 --> 55:00.448
You know,
fame is supposed to be my turf.

55:02.461 --> 55:03.061
LB.

55:06.799 --> 55:09.496
If you don't get more distinguished
every time I see you.

55:09.601 --> 55:12.380
Ah, you look so beautiful.

55:20.229 --> 55:21.844
Is that true?

55:21.948 --> 55:26.316
...Mr Randolph Scott.
They make a handsome couple...

55:30.531 --> 55:32.395
Don't worry about it, Howard.

55:32.500 --> 55:34.606
She's just working the room.

55:34.710 --> 55:37.074
It's her job, baby.

55:38.372 --> 55:42.989
Sultry southern tigress
Ava Gardner dazzles the room tonight.

55:43.093 --> 55:47.961
She's the newest star in the MGM galaxy.
And believe you me...

55:51.510 --> 55:56.303
Jane Eyre has been selling
popcorn for over a hundred years, LB.

56:37.932 --> 56:39.132
Hello.

56:41.018 --> 56:42.218
Hello.

56:47.691 --> 56:50.527
Could you reach me a towel?

56:57.993 --> 56:58.793
I...

57:00.878 --> 57:04.157
I really can't do that.

57:05.751 --> 57:07.751
I'm sorry.

57:32.027 --> 57:36.600
I'm an idiot.
I'm a complete idiot and I'm sorry.

57:36.704 --> 57:37.808
- Forget it.
- No, no.

57:37.912 --> 57:42.231
I'm a vain, preening ass
without a single redeeming feature.

57:42.336 --> 57:45.942
That's not true.
You have very good teeth.

57:46.047 --> 57:47.647
Come on.

57:48.299 --> 57:50.530
I've got a better idea.
Take me flying.

57:50.635 --> 57:54.579
- Or better yet, I'll take you flying.
- Do your worst, Miss Hepburn.

58:03.100 --> 58:05.420
Don't be so squirmy, Howard.

58:05.524 --> 58:07.636
You're going to get on famously
with Father and Mother.

58:07.740 --> 58:11.477
And I'm sure they'll like you, too.
Once they get to know you.

58:19.575 --> 58:20.768
Hello. Hello.

58:20.872 --> 58:23.785
- Kath, hello.
- Kathy.

58:27.333 --> 58:29.262
Sweetheart, who's that
with the camera right there?

58:29.366 --> 58:33.202
That's my ex-husband, Ludlow. Father
and Mother are just mad about Luddie.

58:33.306 --> 58:36.077
What the hell is he doing here?

58:36.181 --> 58:38.539
He's here all the time.

58:38.643 --> 58:39.843
Hello.

58:41.847 --> 58:44.755
Sorry we're late. Mom.

58:44.860 --> 58:46.504
- Thank you.
- Dad.

58:46.608 --> 58:48.882
- Darling.
- Uncle Willy.

58:48.987 --> 58:52.470
Who've we got here?
Don't feel self-conscious.

58:52.575 --> 58:55.596
Hepburns. Hepburns.
Attention, please.

58:55.701 --> 58:58.058
This is Howard.

58:58.163 --> 59:01.269
Howard, welcome.

59:01.373 --> 59:03.905
Don't worry, he's had his lunch.

59:04.995 --> 59:07.193
He likes you.
That's unusual.

59:07.298 --> 59:10.447
We pay our devotion to the arts here.
A colony we created.

59:10.551 --> 59:13.157
Julian's a painter.
Abstract, of course.

59:13.261 --> 59:15.266
What the hell's the point
of painting something real

59:15.370 --> 59:18.161
when you can just take a picture
nowadays, don't you agree?

59:18.265 --> 59:21.167
Where do you stand on politics,
Mr Hughes?

59:21.271 --> 59:23.709
- Excuse me?
- We're all socialists here.

59:23.813 --> 59:26.013
We are not.

59:26.479 --> 59:29.180
You've met Mr Roosevelt.
What make you of him?

59:32.106 --> 59:34.386
What are you sniggering at?

59:34.491 --> 59:37.558
- What? What was that?
- You just sniggered.

59:37.662 --> 59:40.728
No, no. The dog.
It seems to be crushing my feet.

59:40.832 --> 59:42.809
- Oh, my God.
- Buster.

59:42.914 --> 59:44.284
Hey. Hey.

59:45.870 --> 59:47.856
Don't you like dogs?

59:47.960 --> 59:50.864
I will not have you sniggering
at Mr Roosevelt at my table. Please leave.

59:50.968 --> 59:53.280
- No, no, I wasn't.
- I thought everybody liked dogs.

59:53.384 --> 59:54.868
Perhaps he had a bad experience
as a child.

59:54.972 --> 59:57.934
So, Kathy, does it stick in your craw that
Howard here gets more press than you?

59:58.038 --> 01:00:01.206
- A bad experience with a dog?
- No, no.

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:05.957
- You are such a shy creature, aren't you?
- Perhaps it was a very large dog.

01:00:06.062 --> 01:00:07.568
The press can be a damned nuisance...

01:00:07.673 --> 01:00:09.878
- Was it a Doberman?
- It burns my goat.

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:11.676
A Doberman, Mr Hughes, or a dachshund?

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.679
- Neither, sir.
- Dachshunds are little dogs.

01:00:14.783 --> 01:00:16.932
They should all be lined up
against a wall and shot.

01:00:17.036 --> 01:00:19.889
What's that Spanish painting? The...

01:00:19.993 --> 01:00:23.894
- The Goya.
- Goya. Of course. Yes.

01:00:23.998 --> 01:00:27.105
- Yes. Mexicans. Poor lambs.
- What was that called?

01:00:27.209 --> 01:00:31.948
Anyway, that's the vulgar press, I'm sure.
Do you read much, Mr Hughes?

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:35.862
I try to stay up to snuff
on the trade journals, yeah.

01:00:35.967 --> 01:00:37.167
Snuff?

01:00:37.387 --> 01:00:40.748
These would be flying magazines?

01:00:41.592 --> 01:00:44.039
- What was that?
- He's a little deaf.

01:00:44.143 --> 01:00:46.961
- Pass the goddamn butter.
- You read flying magazines?

01:00:47.065 --> 01:00:50.713
- Take the butter.
- Trade journals on engineering, aviation.

01:00:50.817 --> 01:00:53.008
We read books.

01:00:53.112 --> 01:00:57.138
Howard has to read the trade pieces, Mom,
because he's designing a new airplane.

01:00:57.242 --> 01:00:59.474
Oh, really? Do tell.

01:01:02.822 --> 01:01:04.222
Well...

01:01:05.917 --> 01:01:10.647
It's quite exciting, actually.
It's a spy plane for the Air Corps.

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:13.654
A twin-engine plane with some,
I must admit,

01:01:13.759 --> 01:01:16.152
some rather unique design features.

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.282
You see, it has these two booms...

01:01:19.386 --> 01:01:22.621
Luddie built a birdhouse once.
You remember that?

01:01:22.725 --> 01:01:25.580
- Yes, well, a mere trifle.
- I remember the painting.

01:01:25.684 --> 01:01:28.375
- It's called "May 18" or something.
- Hey. Hey.

01:01:28.479 --> 01:01:31.252
Anyway, Goya's vastly overrated.
All the Spaniards are.

01:01:31.356 --> 01:01:34.297
- Nonsense. Picasso is sacred.
- I'm a urologist.

01:01:34.401 --> 01:01:37.533
- It was quite aesthetic, really.
- A sacred monster, that's what Picasso is.

01:01:37.638 --> 01:01:40.224
The birds don't care for it much,
but the bats do.

01:01:40.328 --> 01:01:42.515
- I'll bet.
- That's such bunk.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.019
- Do speak up, dear.
- Nothing, nothing, Mrs Hepburn, nothing.

01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:50.022
Then why did you speak? I can't abide
people who speak but have nothing to say.

01:01:50.126 --> 01:01:53.859
Did you go to mechanic school
to learn all this airplane guff?

01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:55.194
No, no, I didn't, Luddie. No.

01:01:55.298 --> 01:01:58.321
Well, Howard just flew
round the world in three days.

01:01:58.425 --> 01:02:01.532
- We've heard enough about airplanes.
- And dogs, apparently.

01:02:01.637 --> 01:02:05.537
- Then how'd you make all that money?
- We don't care about money here.

01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:09.335
Well, that's because you have it.

01:02:11.765 --> 01:02:14.251
Would you repeat that?

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:17.049
You don't care about money
because you've always had it.

01:02:17.153 --> 01:02:20.093
- Well then, how did you make...
- Excuse me, I'm speaking.

01:02:20.197 --> 01:02:21.889
- OK.
- Thank you.

01:02:21.993 --> 01:02:23.478
All right.

01:02:23.944 --> 01:02:26.392
Some of us choose to work for a living.

01:02:26.496 --> 01:02:33.072
Speaking of which, I have more of that
"airplane guff" to attend to. Excuse me.

01:02:41.837 --> 01:02:44.496
Well, seems a rather high-strung chap.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.089
Well, you're a fine bunch
of bullies, aren't you?

01:02:48.219 --> 01:02:51.332
Have you talked to Mr Mayer
about letting you do <i>Jane Eyre?</i>

01:02:51.436 --> 01:02:55.126
The old Philistine won't budge.
Too arty, don't you know.

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.384
Daddy, I'm convinced,
the man hasn't read anything longer than

01:02:57.488 --> 01:03:00.311
a Sunday <i>Katzenjammer Kids</i> in his life.

01:03:01.357 --> 01:03:04.726
No fair kicking.
You have to use the mallet.

01:03:06.695 --> 01:03:10.391
Really, though, darling, you can't retire
from the field of battle like that

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:14.270
- or they'll never respect you.
- Katie, I don't understand.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:16.690
You were like a different person in there.

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:20.407
They just expect me to be a certain way.

01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:24.783
There's only one real Kate.

01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:27.206
And that's your Kate.

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:32.752
And over in Hollywood,
aviation tycoon Howard Hughes

01:03:32.856 --> 01:03:34.667
seems to be cooking up something big.

01:03:34.771 --> 01:03:37.046
Even as he edits
his newest motion picture,

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.506
he's been secretly meeting
with the US Air Corps.

01:03:39.611 --> 01:03:43.260
We applaud his patriotism and look
forward to his newest mechanical marvel.

01:03:43.364 --> 01:03:46.537
Do you know how many Allied ships we
lost this year because of U-boat attacks?

01:03:46.642 --> 01:03:50.309
- No.
- 681 ships, just this year so far.

01:03:50.413 --> 01:03:53.563
Now, the army needs a new airplane
to fly the troops over to Europe.

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:57.483
These ships, they're sitting ducks.
They're sitting ducks for the U-boats.

01:03:57.587 --> 01:04:01.109
- You want to build a troop carrier plane.
- Stop thinking like an insect, Odie.

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:04.449
Not just a plane to carry the troops.
A plane to carry everything.

01:04:04.553 --> 01:04:09.123
The troops and the jeeps and the tanks
and whatnot. Here, take a look.

01:04:10.259 --> 01:04:12.667
No, other side.

01:04:14.972 --> 01:04:18.585
I figure around 200 feet from nose to tail.
Wingspan around 300.

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:22.546
We're gonna need
about 24,000 horsepower.

01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:25.593
Now, this, this is just what Kaiser
and the army are looking for.

01:04:25.697 --> 01:04:27.474
And don't worry,
they're gonna pay for it this time.

01:04:27.578 --> 01:04:28.930
Christ.
What are you getting us into?

01:04:29.034 --> 01:04:32.685
Well, it's a big plane.
So I'm calling it the Hercules.

01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:34.729
Swell name, isn't it?

01:04:34.834 --> 01:04:39.701
- How heavy you imagine this thing is?
- Say around 200 tons.

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:44.031
Well, I didn't say it was going to be easy.

01:04:44.136 --> 01:04:47.367
All right, boys,
I want you to rig up something like this.

01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:49.327
Should give the proper uplift ratios

01:04:49.431 --> 01:04:52.218
while reducing the need
for additional torque support on the front.

01:04:52.343 --> 01:04:55.251
We are not getting enough production
out of Jane Russell's breasts.

01:04:55.355 --> 01:04:58.512
All right, I want smooth titties, gentlemen.
Smooth titties.

01:05:01.185 --> 01:05:04.925
- It's all in engineering, isn't it, Odie?
- Howard.

01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:09.639
Do you really think they're gonna let you
put out a whole movie just about tits?

01:05:09.743 --> 01:05:13.021
Sure.
Who doesn't like tits?

01:05:23.165 --> 01:05:26.362
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Sorry I'm late.

01:05:26.466 --> 01:05:29.158
Will the secretary please record
that Mr Hughes has arrived,

01:05:29.262 --> 01:05:32.746
and that this session is now called
to order? I yield the floor to Mr Breen.

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:34.956
Mr Hughes, members of the committee,

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.166
I have reviewed Mr Hughes' photoplay
entitled <i>The Outlaw</i>

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:42.126
and I can state categorically that I have
never seen anything quite so unacceptable

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:46.510
as the shots of the mammaries
of the character named Rio.

01:05:46.615 --> 01:05:49.469
For almost half the picture,
the girl's mammaries,

01:05:49.573 --> 01:05:54.850
which are quite large and prominent,
are shockingly uncovered.

01:05:54.954 --> 01:05:59.065
For this reason I have concluded the
picture appeals only to prurient interests

01:05:59.169 --> 01:06:04.315
and should be denied the Motion Picture
Association's seal of approval.

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:06.779
Really, Mr Hughes.

01:06:06.883 --> 01:06:10.910
- Thank you, Mr Breen. Mr Hughes.
- Thank you, Mr Chairman.

01:06:11.014 --> 01:06:12.742
Mr Breen,
it's good to see you again.

01:06:12.846 --> 01:06:17.374
I haven't seen you all since that situation
with all the violence in <i>Scarface.</i>

01:06:17.478 --> 01:06:20.544
The situation here seems to revolve
around Miss Russell's mammaries.

01:06:20.649 --> 01:06:23.337
Mr Breen feels that
they are too prominent, yes?

01:06:23.441 --> 01:06:26.880
More prominent than other mammaries
have been up on the screen?

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:31.024
Well, I hope to dispel that notion.

01:06:33.235 --> 01:06:35.477
Jean Harlow.

01:06:36.655 --> 01:06:38.613
Ann Sheridan.

01:06:39.784 --> 01:06:41.105
Irene Dunne.

01:06:41.209 --> 01:06:43.482
Claudette Colbert.

01:06:43.586 --> 01:06:45.443
Rita Hayworth.

01:06:45.548 --> 01:06:46.777
Betty Grable.

01:06:46.881 --> 01:06:50.071
And the lovely Miss Jane Russell.

01:06:50.175 --> 01:06:53.244
Now, all these shots,
save for Miss Russell,

01:06:53.348 --> 01:06:58.328
were enlarged from pictures
that received Mr Breen's seal of approval.

01:06:58.432 --> 01:07:03.766
Now, as you have probably noticed
by now, they all contain mammaries.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.503
I will ask my associate to join me now.

01:07:06.607 --> 01:07:10.931
May I introduce Dr Ludlow Branson
of Columbia University?

01:07:12.942 --> 01:07:14.942
Dr Branson

01:07:15.366 --> 01:07:18.974
is a mathematician of some note.

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:20.105
Yes, you.

01:07:20.209 --> 01:07:23.523
And he will now demonstrate that, in fact,

01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:27.193
Miss Russell's mammaries
are no more prominent

01:07:27.298 --> 01:07:30.493
than any of these other fine ladies'.

01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:34.045
Doctor.

01:07:35.422 --> 01:07:36.822
Doctor,

01:07:38.013 --> 01:07:41.424
you forgot your callipers.

01:07:46.934 --> 01:07:49.507
Gentlemen, Mr Hughes.

01:07:52.898 --> 01:07:58.643
Let us commence by calling this
Mammary Exhibit Number One.

01:07:58.747 --> 01:08:05.230
Now, you'll see that the length
of the actual cleavage,

01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:07.735
if I may, is

01:08:09.466 --> 01:08:13.613
five inches and quarter.
Now, if we move to Mammary Exhibit...

01:08:13.717 --> 01:08:15.253
Dateline Hollywoodland.

01:08:16.087 --> 01:08:18.663
Movie tycoon Howard Hughes
must have the greatest job in the land.

01:08:18.768 --> 01:08:22.792
Each and every night the lucky guy
has to escort a different beautiful woman

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:26.877
to a different dazzling event.
The TWA king always talks up his airline

01:08:26.981 --> 01:08:29.845
as he escorts a succession...

01:08:31.895 --> 01:08:35.425
The Hercules, ladies and gentlemen.
The Hercules.

01:08:35.529 --> 01:08:39.596
A plane, a boat, a flying city.

01:08:39.701 --> 01:08:43.019
Now, don't forget. Every bill comes to me.
They don't pay for anything.

01:08:43.124 --> 01:08:46.772
Those men decide whether or not to fund
the plane, so I need them real happy.

01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:49.399
- You do what it takes.
- You betcha, boss.

01:08:49.504 --> 01:08:52.111
What about the girls?
How are they in the bomb department?

01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:56.198
Well, let's put it this way.
It'll be a regular boob buffet.

01:08:56.301 --> 01:08:59.662
I don't think the gentlemen from the Air
Corps will have any trouble scoring tonight.

01:08:59.767 --> 01:09:05.372
And inside, 700 brave American soldiers,
a dozen Sherman tanks,

01:09:05.477 --> 01:09:10.542
all winging their way over the Atlantic,
free from the threats of the U-boats below.

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:15.133
Could Jules Verne himself have ever
imagined anything so magnificent?

01:09:15.237 --> 01:09:19.093
Could he have imagined her mammoth
wingspan, longer than a football field?

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:21.095
Don't you see how this demeans me?

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.103
Since when do you care about
the scandal rags?

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:27.059
Every time there's a picture of you with
another woman, it's like a slap in the face.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:30.234
- Don't you understand that?
- That's overstating it just a bit.

01:09:30.337 --> 01:09:33.737
Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers,
Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine,

01:09:33.841 --> 01:09:36.832
and now Bette Davis, for God's sake.

01:09:38.546 --> 01:09:43.884
Look. They're Cracker Jack candy, honey.
They don't mean anything to me.

01:09:44.885 --> 01:09:46.885
Very nice.

01:09:48.305 --> 01:09:51.546
Well, you're the one that said
that all men are predators, right?

01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:54.589
I mean, it's all in Darwin.
Remember?

01:09:54.693 --> 01:09:58.632
And am I to expect this behaviour
to continue after the wedding?

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:05.269
What is really bothering you, Kate?
Is it the women? Or the publicity?

01:10:09.368 --> 01:10:13.911
Can't you eat ice cream from a bowl
like everyone else in the world?

01:10:20.713 --> 01:10:23.713
Don't you dare.

01:10:35.895 --> 01:10:36.895
Yeah.

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:42.092
No. Odie, this is not a good time.

01:10:42.197 --> 01:10:46.432
For Christ's sakes, we can't make the
Hercules if we don't have any aluminum.

01:10:46.537 --> 01:10:49.727
Wait. No, no.
I can hear you better now.

01:10:49.831 --> 01:10:54.858
Look, you tell the War Production Board
that this is an essential strategic operation.

01:10:54.963 --> 01:10:57.427
Odie, if they're giving aluminum
to Douglas, Northrop and Boeing,

01:10:57.531 --> 01:10:59.571
they sure as hell
can give some to Hughes Aircraft.

01:10:59.676 --> 01:11:02.865
Don't set the ice cream...

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:04.684
Meantime, we've got to think
of something else.

01:11:04.788 --> 01:11:07.290
If we can't get aluminum,
we'll just have to find another way.

01:11:07.394 --> 01:11:09.083
Christ, I don't know.
You tell me.

01:11:09.187 --> 01:11:14.000
We'll find some alloy that works
just as well. Right. Look...

01:11:14.105 --> 01:11:16.300
If we can't get any aluminum,
we'll just have to use wood.

01:11:16.404 --> 01:11:18.505
You can't make
a 200-ton plane out of wood.

01:11:18.609 --> 01:11:20.971
Why the hell not?
The damn thing is a flying boat, right?

01:11:21.075 --> 01:11:22.952
- What do they use to make boats out of?
- Oak.

01:11:23.056 --> 01:11:26.180
Think of the Hercules
like a flying Spanish galleon.

01:11:26.285 --> 01:11:29.558
Spanish galleons could weigh 1,200 tons.

01:11:29.662 --> 01:11:32.226
Good luck today.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.650
We just have to find the right kind of wood.
Something light but strong.

01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:38.747
- Morning, Kate.
- Pine, cedar, maybe birch.

01:11:49.093 --> 01:11:50.293
Catch.

01:11:54.598 --> 01:11:56.879
From my farm.

01:11:56.983 --> 01:11:59.930
If you like it,
I can get you a bushel.

01:12:12.366 --> 01:12:15.284
Trouble with Mr Hughes?

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.749
There's too much Howard Hughes
in Howard Hughes.

01:12:26.422 --> 01:12:28.498
That's the trouble.

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:43.770
Beautiful.

01:12:45.608 --> 01:12:48.222
Don't you even take Christmas off?

01:12:48.326 --> 01:12:51.099
Nice to see you, Bob.
Sorry, I've got grease on my hands.

01:12:51.203 --> 01:12:53.770
Have we got something to show you?

01:12:57.953 --> 01:13:03.653
Take a look. She's the XF-11
reconnaissance flier. Spy plane, really.

01:13:03.757 --> 01:13:06.531
Designed every inch of her myself.

01:13:06.635 --> 01:13:08.782
She's got a top speed of 450,

01:13:08.886 --> 01:13:11.706
which means she can outrun
anything they throw against her.

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:14.958
After the Japs stole my H-1 design
for their goddamn Zeros,

01:13:15.062 --> 01:13:18.167
I figured I needed to do them one better.

01:13:18.272 --> 01:13:21.589
Yeah. She's my Buck Rogers ship.

01:13:21.694 --> 01:13:23.883
She's a looker.

01:13:23.988 --> 01:13:26.055
OK, what have you got for me?

01:13:33.239 --> 01:13:35.686
Jiminy Cricket.

01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:39.523
Seating capacity for 60.
Wingspan, 123 feet.

01:13:39.627 --> 01:13:42.983
Four double Cyclone engines.
Her ceiling's 25,000 feet.

01:13:43.087 --> 01:13:46.406
- Gross weight?
- 86,000. Wing loading of 41 pounds.

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:49.410
So less drag on the plane in thinner air.

01:13:49.514 --> 01:13:53.956
At high cruise power, you're looking
at a top speed of around 340.

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:58.668
Giving her a range of about 3,000 miles.

01:13:58.772 --> 01:14:01.801
- Cross-country.
- Nonstop.

01:14:02.601 --> 01:14:04.838
Bob, you know something?

01:14:04.942 --> 01:14:07.642
You are a son of a bitch.

01:14:19.535 --> 01:14:22.240
Bob, you got something on your suit.

01:14:23.497 --> 01:14:24.497
Yeah.

01:14:25.255 --> 01:14:29.828
On your lapel there.
You got something on your lapel.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.956
Right there, Bob.

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:38.207
You missed it.
Right there.

01:14:38.311 --> 01:14:40.418
Clean it off, would you?

01:14:40.523 --> 01:14:43.123
Here. Thanks.

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:49.271
Now throw it away.

01:14:51.817 --> 01:14:54.355
No, over there.

01:14:59.617 --> 01:15:03.607
Thanks.
So, what do you call her?

01:15:03.711 --> 01:15:05.984
The Constellation.
But we can change that.

01:15:06.089 --> 01:15:07.863
No, no, no.

01:15:07.968 --> 01:15:10.628
It's pretty. I like her.

01:15:11.796 --> 01:15:15.786
So, what kind of deal can you give me?
What kind of deal can you give me?

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:18.452
We'll give you the first 40 planes
off the assembly line.

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:21.038
That should give us
about two years exclusivity with her?

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:22.587
Hell, more than that.

01:15:22.691 --> 01:15:26.754
United and American don't have
the imagination for a plane like this.

01:15:26.858 --> 01:15:29.972
Two years ahead of Juan Trippe, then.

01:15:34.527 --> 01:15:38.275
- How much?
- 450,000 each.

01:15:38.906 --> 01:15:42.646
That's 18 million for the first 40.

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:48.200
Hell, TWA can't afford that.
The damn airline's flat broke.

01:15:49.875 --> 01:15:52.580
Guess I'll just have
to pay for them myself.

01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:56.409
Build them, Bob.
Send the bill to Noah Dietrich.

01:15:56.513 --> 01:15:58.250
And thank you.

01:16:01.846 --> 01:16:03.832
Merry Christmas.

01:16:03.936 --> 01:16:07.560
You have just placed the largest order for
airplanes in the history of the damn planet.

01:16:08.435 --> 01:16:10.302
Lockheed just sent us a bill for $18 million.

01:16:10.406 --> 01:16:13.970
Now now, don't get all hysterical on me,
Noah. It isn't good for you.

01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:17.761
- This is a lot of money for some planes.
- Yes. Yes, I know it's a lot of money.

01:16:17.866 --> 01:16:21.518
It's too damn much. You think I've just got
$18 million in petty cash?

01:16:21.623 --> 01:16:23.690
I should have told you earlier.
It slipped my mind.

01:16:23.795 --> 01:16:26.401
- Slipped your mind? For God's sake.
- Right. Well, look...

01:16:26.506 --> 01:16:30.274
- How could $18 million slip your mind?
- I'll get back to you. Goodbye, now.

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:33.624
Hey, honey.
What are you doing home?

01:16:37.882 --> 01:16:41.789
You're not one for tears
and, well, neither am I.

01:16:41.893 --> 01:16:45.337
So it's best to come out with it.

01:16:48.309 --> 01:16:53.054
I've met someone.
I've fallen in love and I'm moving out.

01:16:55.274 --> 01:16:59.930
If I could make it any more gentle, I would.

01:17:00.034 --> 01:17:02.434
But I can't.

01:17:02.747 --> 01:17:06.405
So there we both are.

01:17:10.706 --> 01:17:12.654
Let's be honest.

01:17:12.758 --> 01:17:17.240
It's all been a grand adventure,
but it couldn't possibly last.

01:17:17.344 --> 01:17:21.335
We're too alike, you and I.

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:26.623
- You met someone?
- Someone more appropriate.

01:17:26.727 --> 01:17:28.928
To me, I mean.

01:17:31.602 --> 01:17:34.549
What does that mean,
more appropriate?

01:17:34.653 --> 01:17:39.219
Someone more attuned to my needs.

01:17:39.323 --> 01:17:42.936
Look at me, Katie.
Stop acting.

01:17:44.615 --> 01:17:46.691
I'm not acting.

01:17:51.330 --> 01:17:54.117
I wonder if you even know any more.

01:17:58.879 --> 01:18:00.955
Don't be unkind.

01:18:03.759 --> 01:18:04.959
You...

01:18:06.855 --> 01:18:09.855
You want to go?

01:18:11.809 --> 01:18:13.009
Go on.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.048
Actresses are cheap in this town, darling.
I got a lot of money.

01:18:18.153 --> 01:18:22.600
- Howard, please. This is beneath you.
- No, no, this is exactly me.

01:18:22.704 --> 01:18:25.604
You come in here out of the blue and
tell me you're leaving me just like that,

01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:27.933
and you have the nerve
to expect graciousness?

01:18:28.038 --> 01:18:33.483
I expect a little maturity. I expect you
to face the situation like an adult who...

01:18:33.587 --> 01:18:37.443
Don't talk down to me.
Don't you ever talk down to me.

01:18:37.547 --> 01:18:40.912
You are a movie star, nothing more.

01:19:52.952 --> 01:19:56.071
Don't answer it.

01:19:57.581 --> 01:19:59.446
What is it, Howard?

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:01.550
Hey, Noah.

01:20:01.716 --> 01:20:04.951
I need you to get to Penney's
and buy me new clothes.

01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:07.078
- Penney's isn't open.
- Shit.

01:20:07.183 --> 01:20:11.497
- It's two in the morning.
- Yeah, that's right. Ah, well.

01:20:11.602 --> 01:20:13.086
First thing tomorrow, then, all right?

01:20:13.191 --> 01:20:16.210
I need two suits off the rack.
One light and one dark.

01:20:16.315 --> 01:20:19.755
Three white shirts and three pairs
of white tennis shoes. You got that?

01:20:19.859 --> 01:20:22.929
- Yeah.
- No, no. Make it Woolworths.

01:20:23.033 --> 01:20:26.553
- Woolworths.
- No, no. Penney's. Penney's.

01:20:26.657 --> 01:20:28.932
All right, then.

01:20:29.037 --> 01:20:32.520
I'll get into it as soon as I can, Howard.

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:35.940
- Noah, do you have a recorder?
- No.

01:20:36.045 --> 01:20:39.566
- Are you recording this conversation?
- No.

01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:40.270
OK.

01:20:41.468 --> 01:20:43.868
I trust you.

01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:44.868
Howard...

01:20:44.972 --> 01:20:47.742
Listen, I need those suits
first thing tomorrow, all right?

01:20:47.846 --> 01:20:49.033
- All right.
- Wait, wait.

01:20:49.137 --> 01:20:52.290
- Did I say Penney's or Woolworths?
- Penney's.

01:20:52.394 --> 01:20:56.135
- Better make it Sears.
- All right, then. Sears.

01:20:59.643 --> 01:21:01.719
I'm sorry, honey.

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:05.388
If I don't answer,
he'll just call back.

01:21:26.962 --> 01:21:30.581
Stop there, if you please,
Miss Domergue.

01:21:35.805 --> 01:21:39.628
Have you had surgery, Miss Domergue?

01:21:39.732 --> 01:21:40.332
No.

01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:45.353
Do you have scars of any kind?

01:21:46.565 --> 01:21:47.165
No.

01:21:49.777 --> 01:21:52.315
Wipe off your lipstick.

01:21:56.492 --> 01:21:59.189
That's much better.

01:21:59.294 --> 01:22:04.411
Now, you understand that you'd be
under contract to me, personally?

01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:07.700
Do you know what that means?

01:22:15.928 --> 01:22:18.633
Turn around for me.

01:22:25.896 --> 01:22:27.896
Very nice.

01:22:28.321 --> 01:22:30.641
You move well.

01:22:32.945 --> 01:22:36.602
You live with your family, do you?

01:22:36.706 --> 01:22:37.506
Yes.

01:22:39.289 --> 01:22:41.689
That's nice.

01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:45.109
Tell me something.

01:22:45.214 --> 01:22:47.745
How old are you, Miss Domergue?

01:22:50.463 --> 01:22:51.063
15.

01:22:55.676 --> 01:22:58.001
Holy mother of God.

01:23:16.322 --> 01:23:20.439
Well, a car picks me up
every morning at eight, and off I go.

01:23:20.544 --> 01:23:26.361
I am getting my high-school diploma.
Howard thinks that education is important.

01:23:26.465 --> 01:23:28.777
- That's right.
- And then after classes,

01:23:28.881 --> 01:23:32.450
I'm off for elocution
and grooming and fittings.

01:23:32.555 --> 01:23:34.622
Well, blow me down.

01:23:35.716 --> 01:23:38.166
Don't tell me Pan Am's
working out of the Cocoanut Grove now?

01:23:38.271 --> 01:23:40.208
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Juan.

01:23:40.312 --> 01:23:41.958
Helen, good to see you.

01:23:42.062 --> 01:23:44.670
- How are you, Howard?
- Good, thanks.

01:23:44.774 --> 01:23:48.590
- This is Miss Faith Domergue.
- Sit down. Now, what you doing out here?

01:23:48.695 --> 01:23:51.679
Well, I'm out this way to meet
with Douglas about the DC-4.

01:23:51.783 --> 01:23:55.681
That's our new plane
and it is gonna be a pip, let me tell you.

01:23:55.785 --> 01:23:59.224
- How's the Constellation coming?
- Good.

01:23:59.328 --> 01:24:00.528
Great.

01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:04.619
So, how about letting me steal a peek?

01:24:06.455 --> 01:24:08.403
Don't think so.

01:24:08.507 --> 01:24:12.361
You know, I should be cross with you.
You stole Ray Loewy from us.

01:24:12.465 --> 01:24:14.328
He's doing our interior design.
That's right.

01:24:14.432 --> 01:24:16.913
He was doing ours.

01:24:18.467 --> 01:24:21.459
So, what are your colours?

01:24:21.563 --> 01:24:23.345
Stop fishing.

01:24:24.974 --> 01:24:29.130
So, you have buttons or zippers?

01:24:29.234 --> 01:24:30.888
I'm sorry?

01:24:32.690 --> 01:24:34.510
Buttons or zippers?

01:24:34.615 --> 01:24:37.775
For the drapes on the sleeping berths.

01:24:40.156 --> 01:24:41.756
Zippers.

01:24:50.624 --> 01:24:52.224
Buttons?

01:25:01.927 --> 01:25:05.002
So, I suppose you'll be
expanding on down to Mexico.

01:25:05.107 --> 01:25:08.294
- Why do you say that?
- Well, your range is 3,000 miles.

01:25:08.398 --> 01:25:11.339
I would imagine you'd expand
from Los Angeles to Mexico.

01:25:11.443 --> 01:25:14.716
- And maybe on down to South America.
- Hey, that's a good idea.

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:18.267
- Anyone got a pen?
- Or across the Atlantic.

01:25:20.446 --> 01:25:23.892
Now, honey, you've had enough of this
ice cream. You give me that spoon.

01:25:23.996 --> 01:25:27.407
You don't want to get your gloves all sticky.

01:25:28.454 --> 01:25:30.493
Isn't that too far?

01:25:35.461 --> 01:25:39.126
New York to Newfoundland...

01:25:40.382 --> 01:25:42.873
to Ireland...

01:25:46.597 --> 01:25:48.397
to Paris.

01:25:55.314 --> 01:25:56.314
Well,

01:25:57.572 --> 01:26:01.767
Pan Am welcomes you.
We're overbooked as it is.

01:26:01.872 --> 01:26:05.519
It's such a burden doing it all on your own,
let me tell you.

01:26:05.623 --> 01:26:07.814
So, when's the Connie gonna be ready?

01:26:07.918 --> 01:26:10.607
- Next year, maybe. DC-4?
- Next year.

01:26:10.712 --> 01:26:13.984
Well, we look forward to her, then.

01:26:14.088 --> 01:26:17.037
And I to the Connie.

01:26:17.878 --> 01:26:21.785
I've ordered the next 40 after you.

01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:23.203
It's Miss?

01:26:23.308 --> 01:26:24.854
- Domergue.
- Domergue. Yes, of course.

01:26:24.958 --> 01:26:27.502
Now, was that a rumba or a samba
you were doing out there, my dear?

01:26:27.607 --> 01:26:30.543
- It was a samba.
- A samba, yes.

01:26:30.647 --> 01:26:33.975
Howard, I never knew
you were such a good dancer.

01:26:34.812 --> 01:26:37.054
Helen, Jack.

01:26:38.482 --> 01:26:41.890
Good going, boss. You just gave away
our entire postwar strategy.

01:26:41.994 --> 01:26:43.889
- He can't stop us.
- He's Pan Am, Howard.

01:26:43.993 --> 01:26:46.276
He can stop anything.

01:26:47.992 --> 01:26:49.775
Waiter, give me
the largest Scotch you've got.

01:26:49.879 --> 01:26:54.489
I don't know what in the hell you're
so goddamn giddy about. Excuse me.

01:28:45.609 --> 01:28:46.609
Jack.

01:28:47.162 --> 01:28:49.770
All right. I want you to get in touch
with Mr Joyce and Mr Berg.

01:28:49.874 --> 01:28:51.084
Those are my boys in Washington.

01:28:51.188 --> 01:28:53.649
Set up a meeting with Jesse Jones,
he's the secretary of commerce.

01:28:53.753 --> 01:28:55.149
- Old golfing buddy.
- Slow down.

01:28:55.253 --> 01:28:57.646
We're gonna need terminals
in both Ireland and France,

01:28:57.751 --> 01:28:59.175
and I want to get tax breaks from them.

01:28:59.279 --> 01:29:02.238
If that shit-ass thinks that he owns
the entire goddamn world,

01:29:02.343 --> 01:29:04.618
- he's got another think coming.
- Pan Am owns Europe, you know.

01:29:04.722 --> 01:29:06.119
He's smart.
We ought to think about Mexico.

01:29:06.224 --> 01:29:07.225
To hell with Mexico, Jack.

01:29:07.329 --> 01:29:10.203
No one airline should have
a monopoly on flying the Atlantic.

01:29:10.307 --> 01:29:13.792
For Christ's sakes, it isn't fair. Look,
he owns Pan Am. He owns Congress.

01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:17.878
He owns the Civil Aeronautics Board,
but he does not own the sky.

01:29:17.982 --> 01:29:20.968
We are in a street fight with that
son of a bitch now, and I'm not gonna lose.

01:29:21.072 --> 01:29:24.424
I've been fighting high-hat, Ivy-League
pricks like him my whole goddamn life.

01:29:24.528 --> 01:29:28.302
And listen, fire Ray Loewy.
You goddamn heard me? Fire Ray Loewy.

01:29:28.406 --> 01:29:31.726
He's spying for Trippe. That shit-heel
knew all about the goddamn buttons.

01:29:31.831 --> 01:29:35.820
Spies in my midst, Jack.
Spies in my midst.

01:29:50.841 --> 01:29:54.293
- Hello, Howard.
- Roland.

01:29:55.638 --> 01:29:59.089
So, what can I do for you?

01:30:02.186 --> 01:30:06.220
I want all the pictures you have
of Kate Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.

01:30:06.324 --> 01:30:09.928
All the negatives.
And I want you to kill the story.

01:30:10.032 --> 01:30:13.435
Howard, he's a married man.
He's a Catholic.

01:30:13.539 --> 01:30:17.480
They're both movie stars.
Fair game all around.

01:30:24.291 --> 01:30:27.366
My office knows where I am, Howard.

01:30:27.471 --> 01:30:30.369
I'm not gonna kill you, Roland.

01:30:30.474 --> 01:30:32.920
I don't do that.

01:30:37.138 --> 01:30:39.925
- How much?
- Not for sale.

01:30:42.685 --> 01:30:44.485
How much?

01:30:45.487 --> 01:30:48.087
Not for sale.

01:30:51.861 --> 01:30:55.768
You ever cheat on your wife, Roland?

01:30:55.872 --> 01:30:58.895
You ever screw a coloured girl?

01:30:58.999 --> 01:31:02.409
You ever steal anything?
You ever hurt anyone?

01:31:04.331 --> 01:31:06.529
Good night, Howard.

01:31:06.634 --> 01:31:10.955
You ever go to
a Communist Party meeting, Roland?

01:31:19.388 --> 01:31:21.388
TWA stock.

01:31:22.606 --> 01:31:24.406
How much?

01:31:25.445 --> 01:31:29.136
- 50,000 shares.
- Ten.

01:31:32.067 --> 01:31:34.067
All right.

01:31:36.697 --> 01:31:38.434
This isn't gonna be that easy.

01:31:38.539 --> 01:31:42.107
He's been making big contributions
on both sides of the aisle.

01:31:42.211 --> 01:31:45.816
And Jack Frye is out there lobbying
everybody in town.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:49.949
The French and British ambassadors
are all lined up on his side now.

01:31:50.053 --> 01:31:54.078
I'm telling you, TWA is serious
about going international.

01:31:54.182 --> 01:31:58.957
OK. Point, Mr Hughes.
Very well. You know what I think?

01:31:59.061 --> 01:32:01.712
I think it's time for you to introduce
the Community Airline Bill

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:04.128
on the floor of the Senate.

01:32:04.232 --> 01:32:07.004
- Is it done?
- My people are finishing it right now.

01:32:07.109 --> 01:32:13.223
I also have to get you on the committee
investigating the national defence.

01:32:14.193 --> 01:32:17.434
On the committee or chairman?

01:32:17.538 --> 01:32:20.309
You know, I could be
much more effective as chairman.

01:32:20.414 --> 01:32:24.186
It's a great public platform.
You know, it generates a lot of press.

01:32:24.291 --> 01:32:26.234
Wasn't Truman chairman
of that committee?

01:32:26.338 --> 01:32:30.276
Yeah, right. Now he's vice president.
Look what he did with it.

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:33.180
No, I think...

01:32:33.305 --> 01:32:35.781
I think chairman.

01:32:35.885 --> 01:32:39.244
What do you think?

01:32:39.348 --> 01:32:42.123
- Chairman. That is interesting.
- Yeah.

01:32:42.227 --> 01:32:45.712
Let me show you these specs
for the DC-4.

01:32:45.816 --> 01:32:49.548
Ava, what do you think about
"Trans World Airlines"?

01:32:49.652 --> 01:32:52.131
"Transcontinental and Western"
just doesn't fit any more.

01:32:52.235 --> 01:32:55.011
Now that we're international,
we need a name that reflects that.

01:32:55.115 --> 01:32:57.972
"Trans World" is good.
Kind of peppy.

01:32:58.076 --> 01:33:00.276
TWA. Right?

01:33:00.744 --> 01:33:03.690
Keep the same initials. That way you
don't need to repaint any of the planes.

01:33:03.795 --> 01:33:06.980
That's you, always pinching pennies.

01:33:07.084 --> 01:33:09.155
Hand me my wrap.

01:33:23.137 --> 01:33:25.426
Knock it off.

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:35.095
I have something for you.

01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:37.199
Stay here.

01:33:42.531 --> 01:33:45.311
- What the hell is this?
- It's a present.

01:33:45.415 --> 01:33:48.523
Go on and open it.

01:33:48.627 --> 01:33:52.028
A box of trash.
You shouldn't have.

01:33:52.133 --> 01:33:54.698
Keep looking.
Keep looking.

01:33:58.672 --> 01:34:01.664
It's a Kashmiri sapphire.
Best in the world.

01:34:01.768 --> 01:34:04.123
I had my boys all over the damn globe
looking for this.

01:34:04.227 --> 01:34:06.999
- Why?
- Because.

01:34:07.104 --> 01:34:10.960
Look.
It matches your eyes.

01:34:11.064 --> 01:34:13.546
I am not for sale.

01:34:13.650 --> 01:34:15.760
For Christ sakes, Ava,
it's just a present.

01:34:15.865 --> 01:34:19.219
You can't buy me, Howard,
so stop trying.

01:34:19.323 --> 01:34:22.848
Don't buy me any more diamonds or
sapphires or any other goddamn thing.

01:34:22.952 --> 01:34:26.144
You can buy me dinner.
How about that?

01:34:26.248 --> 01:34:27.570
Jesus, Ava.

01:34:28.410 --> 01:34:31.607
It's bad enough I have to endure
those filthy gym shoes of yours,

01:34:31.712 --> 01:34:36.695
but then I get all dolled up and we have
to go out in this old jalopy without a hood.

01:34:36.799 --> 01:34:39.991
Ava, will you marry me?

01:34:40.095 --> 01:34:41.410
No, Howard.

01:34:41.514 --> 01:34:45.625
- Why not, for heaven's sake?
- In the first place, I don't love you.

01:34:45.729 --> 01:34:48.167
In the second place, I'm still married.

01:34:48.271 --> 01:34:53.048
Look, you got girls stashed all over town.
You got a damn harem just at the Bel-Air.

01:34:53.152 --> 01:34:55.104
Why don't you marry
one of your bungalow girls?

01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:57.512
Those are employees.
I'm not going to marry an employee.

01:34:57.617 --> 01:35:00.519
Jesus Christ, how would that look?

01:35:06.115 --> 01:35:08.606
Good Lord, what is going on?

01:35:11.829 --> 01:35:14.534
- Oh, my God.
- Goddamn it.

01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:17.241
Faith.

01:35:18.093 --> 01:35:20.155
- Faith. What the hell?
- Look out.

01:35:20.259 --> 01:35:23.208
Goddamn, what the hell are you doing?

01:35:26.051 --> 01:35:28.915
- You OK, lady?
- What are you doing with her?

01:35:29.019 --> 01:35:31.754
We're going to dinner, that's all.
Now get out of there.

01:35:31.858 --> 01:35:33.919
Get that crazy bitch away from me.

01:35:34.023 --> 01:35:37.425
- Don't you love me any more?
- Course I love you, pork chop.

01:35:37.530 --> 01:35:39.758
- Ava, look over here.
- Howard.

01:35:39.862 --> 01:35:42.099
- Hey.
- Come on, Howard.

01:35:45.446 --> 01:35:47.750
Juan Trippe is working with
that goddamn Senator Brewster now.

01:35:47.854 --> 01:35:48.682
They're after you, Howard.

01:35:48.787 --> 01:35:51.940
If the Community Airline Bill becomes law,
we are finished, my friend.

01:35:52.044 --> 01:35:54.340
Pan Am will have a legal monopoly
on international travel.

01:35:54.444 --> 01:35:56.816
How can they justify it, Jack?
It's un-American.

01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:59.262
Senator Brewster's saying that
nationalised foreign carriers,

01:35:59.366 --> 01:36:00.738
like Air France and Lufthansa,

01:36:00.842 --> 01:36:03.700
can offer lower rates
cos they don't have to compete, right?

01:36:03.804 --> 01:36:05.977
So, hey, let's just get rid of
all that messy competition

01:36:06.081 --> 01:36:08.959
and have a nationalised airline of our own,
and why don't we make it Pan Am?

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:10.836
I'm not kowtowing to Washington
or anyone else.

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.916
- Howard, I need you up here.
- One sec, Odie.

01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:15.795
Look, we are Trans World Airlines,
all right?

01:36:15.899 --> 01:36:20.465
Get me something with a circle or a globe
or something round, for God's sake.

01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:23.306
Speak up. I know.
I don't give a rat's ass what he says.

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:26.309
I'm not making a single cut.
Tell him I'm releasing without a seal.

01:36:26.413 --> 01:36:28.141
All right.
We gotta go public with this.

01:36:28.245 --> 01:36:30.251
I'm gonna talk to Hearst,
see what press he can give me,

01:36:30.355 --> 01:36:32.336
but sooner or later it's gonna come down
to a vote in the Senate,

01:36:32.441 --> 01:36:33.567
so we gotta get senators on our side.

01:36:33.671 --> 01:36:36.278
- What do you want me to do?
- Do what Trippe does, for Christ sake.

01:36:36.382 --> 01:36:37.650
Set up some offshore operations.

01:36:37.754 --> 01:36:40.011
See who's up for re-election.
Let's start making donations.

01:36:40.115 --> 01:36:43.491
- So, you want me to bribe senators?
- I don't want them bribed, Jack.

01:36:43.596 --> 01:36:46.201
I want it done legally.
I want them bought.

01:36:46.306 --> 01:36:48.227
And put a team of investigators
on Senator Brewster.

01:36:48.332 --> 01:36:50.833
I need to know everything there is to know
about that shit bag.

01:36:50.937 --> 01:36:53.920
Where he goes, what he says
and who he screws.

01:36:54.024 --> 01:36:57.218
- Get into it right now, Jack.
- You got it.

01:37:03.732 --> 01:37:06.484
Just give me a second.

01:37:07.403 --> 01:37:11.016
- All right. What do you need?
- Rudder and elevators.

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.937
These are fine. Have Simon and Pete get
back to me on the hydraulic assemblies.

01:37:16.042 --> 01:37:19.815
- We need a secondary system here.
- OK.

01:37:19.919 --> 01:37:22.779
And listen, we need to take
another look at the wheel.

01:37:22.883 --> 01:37:27.367
- Jesus. The damn wheel?
- Yeah. It just doesn't feel right.

01:37:27.471 --> 01:37:31.666
Christ almighty, you've seen 8,000
goddamn wheels. Choose one, please.

01:37:31.770 --> 01:37:33.498
- Just one of them.
- I know. I know.

01:37:33.602 --> 01:37:35.998
- This one?
- I know. This one...

01:37:36.102 --> 01:37:38.213
This one's pretty close.

01:37:38.317 --> 01:37:40.385
Pretty close.

01:38:15.971 --> 01:38:16.971
Odie?

01:38:18.312 --> 01:38:21.005
That man sweeping up over there.

01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:24.259
Does he work for me?
I mean, have you seen him before?

01:38:24.363 --> 01:38:27.106
Name's Nick.
Something like that.

01:38:29.151 --> 01:38:31.025
Why's he looking at me?

01:38:33.155 --> 01:38:35.231
I don't know.

01:38:36.492 --> 01:38:39.899
Fire him. And make sure they use
damp brooms from now on.

01:38:40.004 --> 01:38:43.403
Respiratory diseases are expensive, and
I don't want a bunch of damn lawsuits.

01:38:43.507 --> 01:38:46.366
OK. But can we at least proceed
with the instrument panel we discussed?

01:38:46.471 --> 01:38:47.534
The tool shop's ready to go.

01:38:47.638 --> 01:38:49.557
- No. I wanna see the blueprints again.
- Howard,

01:38:49.661 --> 01:38:52.161
the deadline is now completely unrealistic.

01:38:52.265 --> 01:38:54.955
At this rate, the war is gonna be over
by the time she's done.

01:38:55.059 --> 01:38:57.499
Now, I need you here
to help consult on vital decisions

01:38:57.604 --> 01:38:59.295
and you're off dealing with movies.

01:38:59.399 --> 01:39:02.487
You got a thousand goddamn workers
waiting for you to make a decision here...

01:39:02.591 --> 01:39:04.175
Hey. Odie.

01:39:04.279 --> 01:39:07.761
Take it easy, all right?
I understand you're under a lot of pressure,

01:39:07.865 --> 01:39:13.095
but it's gonna do me no good if you
crack up on me like that. All right? Look.

01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:15.515
Take a couple of hours off, all right?

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:17.562
- You relax a little.
- OK.

01:39:17.666 --> 01:39:20.272
- See your wife.
- OK.

01:39:20.376 --> 01:39:22.376
All right.

01:39:22.627 --> 01:39:26.405
- Be sure to show me all the blueprints.
- All right.

01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:29.951
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:30.171 --> 01:39:32.240
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:32.345 --> 01:39:37.411
I'm serious, now.
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:37.515 --> 01:39:39.524
Show me all the blue...
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:39.628 --> 01:39:42.293
- Howard...
- Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:42.397 --> 01:39:44.550
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:44.654 --> 01:39:48.425
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:51.264
I want to get this done right,
so show me all the blueprints.

01:39:51.368 --> 01:39:52.929
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:53.033 --> 01:39:55.060
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:55.164 --> 01:39:57.563
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:57.667 --> 01:40:00.059
- Show me all the blueprints.
- Howard.

01:40:00.163 --> 01:40:03.575
Show me all the blueprints.

01:40:03.788 --> 01:40:07.737
Show me all the blueprints.

01:40:07.958 --> 01:40:11.078
Show me all the blueprints.

01:40:32.233 --> 01:40:34.433
Quarantine.

01:40:35.328 --> 01:40:36.128
Q...

01:40:37.410 --> 01:40:38.210
U...

01:40:39.662 --> 01:40:40.462
A...

01:40:42.502 --> 01:40:43.302
R...

01:40:45.211 --> 01:40:46.011
A...

01:40:47.295 --> 01:40:48.095
N...

01:40:49.092 --> 01:40:49.892
T...

01:40:51.507 --> 01:40:52.307
I...

01:40:53.343 --> 01:40:54.143
N...

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:00.160
E.

01:41:04.598 --> 01:41:06.674
Quarantine.

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.877
General McEwan. Colonel Bertrang.
Thanks for coming down.

01:41:47.981 --> 01:41:53.432
- Odie, you reading me OK?
- Yeah, Howard. You're A-OK.

01:41:57.234 --> 01:42:02.655
All right, flight controls are active.
She's all yours.

01:42:09.288 --> 01:42:11.697
She's spotless, Odie.
No wiggle on the wheel or throttles.

01:42:11.801 --> 01:42:13.867
Take it easy.

01:42:30.518 --> 01:42:34.341
- How does she sound, Howard?
- She's whispering to me, buddy.

01:42:34.445 --> 01:42:37.225
All right, make her sing.

01:42:57.086 --> 01:43:00.532
Well, Odie, she can fly.
Congratulations.

01:43:00.636 --> 01:43:05.831
I'm glad to hear it. Retract landing gear and
climb to 5,000 feet on a heading of 2-7-0.

01:43:05.935 --> 01:43:12.381
Retracting landing gear and climbing
to 5,000 feet on a heading 2-7-0.

01:43:16.397 --> 01:43:18.677
- Jesus, she's fast.
- What's your airspeed, Howard?

01:43:18.781 --> 01:43:22.553
- 292.
- All right, take her back to 200.

01:43:22.657 --> 01:43:24.278
No damn way.

01:43:49.930 --> 01:43:51.751
All right, Howard, we gotta bring her home.

01:43:51.855 --> 01:43:55.173
Scheduled time of one hour and 45
minutes has elapsed. Set course for 0-9-0.

01:43:55.277 --> 01:44:00.341
- Give me ten more minutes. Roger that.
- Negative. Howard, bring her home.

01:44:00.445 --> 01:44:01.634
OK. OK.

01:44:01.738 --> 01:44:06.684
Setting course for 0-9-0.

01:44:06.788 --> 01:44:08.939
Preparing to descend.

01:44:12.411 --> 01:44:15.910
- Jesus.
- What is it, Howard?

01:44:16.957 --> 01:44:20.614
The right wing just dipped.
I'm losing starboard engine.

01:44:20.718 --> 01:44:23.658
Increasing power to 2800 rpm.

01:44:23.762 --> 01:44:25.410
Cutting back.

01:44:25.514 --> 01:44:27.714
Increasing starboard engine only.

01:44:28.803 --> 01:44:31.960
Cutting back.
I'm losing altitude.

01:44:32.064 --> 01:44:35.585
Howard, check starboard engine
manifold pressure.

01:44:35.690 --> 01:44:39.009
- It's good, but rpms are low.
- Are both starboard props turning?

01:44:39.113 --> 01:44:40.713
Hold on.

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:43.928
It looks like they are, but she's pulling me
back and starboard, Odie.

01:44:44.032 --> 01:44:47.721
- How bad is your cross control?
- I'm at full left rudder and full left aileron,

01:44:47.826 --> 01:44:50.269
but she won't stay level.
Goddamn it.

01:44:50.373 --> 01:44:53.357
- Howard, give us your position.
- 2,000 feet over...

01:44:53.462 --> 01:44:57.525
Oh, Christ, I don't know.
Beverly Hills. 1,500 feet.

01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:59.450
We're going down.

01:45:00.334 --> 01:45:03.947
I'm gonna try for the Wilshire Country
Club. Ninth hole. You reading me?

01:45:04.051 --> 01:45:08.091
Wilshire Country Club. Copy that.
Howard, reduce engines to one thousand.

01:45:08.717 --> 01:45:11.165
I'm going down.

01:45:11.269 --> 01:45:13.753
I'm not gonna make it, buddy.

01:45:19.979 --> 01:45:21.141
Goddamn it.

01:47:24.353 --> 01:47:27.844
Is there anyone else inside?
Is there anyone else?

01:47:27.948 --> 01:47:28.548
No.

01:47:33.446 --> 01:47:36.392
I'm Howard Hughes, the aviator.

01:47:36.496 --> 01:47:38.096
Come on.

01:47:45.791 --> 01:47:49.032
Every inch of wiring and fluid connection...

01:47:49.136 --> 01:47:51.825
He has burns to 78 per cent of his body.

01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:54.997
Nine ribs are shattered.
Not broken, shattered.

01:47:55.102 --> 01:47:59.626
As are his nose, his chin, his cheek,
his left knee, his left elbow.

01:47:59.730 --> 01:48:02.835
He has 60 lacerations on his face
to the bone.

01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:05.797
His chest was crushed,
so his left lung has collapsed

01:48:05.901 --> 01:48:10.346
and his heart has shifted entirely
to the right side of his chest cavity.

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:12.344
Jesus, God.

01:48:12.448 --> 01:48:15.806
He's getting blood transfusions now, but...

01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:19.396
- Whose blood?
- I'm sorry?

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:22.816
- Whose blood?
- From our stock.

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.776
He's not gonna like that.

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.571
Mr Dietrich, I doubt he's ever
gonna like or dislike anything again.

01:48:30.676 --> 01:48:33.042
I'm terribly sorry.

01:49:01.281 --> 01:49:03.268
Orange juice.

01:49:03.372 --> 01:49:04.772
It's...

01:49:06.212 --> 01:49:09.453
It's not fresh from the kitchen, so I...

01:49:10.499 --> 01:49:14.627
I have them make it here so I can see.

01:49:19.716 --> 01:49:21.792
Look at me.

01:49:24.304 --> 01:49:28.000
I'm a monster.
Yeah.

01:49:28.104 --> 01:49:31.800
Orange juice has nutritional value.

01:49:32.854 --> 01:49:38.183
There's some flies
outside my window, though.

01:49:38.287 --> 01:49:39.287
So...

01:49:42.072 --> 01:49:44.148
little Howard likes...

01:49:46.076 --> 01:49:47.476
citrus.

01:49:49.127 --> 01:49:51.197
Don't he just?

01:49:54.126 --> 01:49:55.726
Tell me.

01:49:57.471 --> 01:50:01.325
An oil seal ripped off
the starboard rear propeller.

01:50:01.429 --> 01:50:05.332
When the pressure dropped,
the prop reversed pitch.

01:50:05.436 --> 01:50:07.627
Do you understand me?

01:50:07.731 --> 01:50:12.712
Howard, I'm sorry to have to tell you
this now, but there's something else.

01:50:12.816 --> 01:50:15.267
- You following me?
- Yeah.

01:50:17.065 --> 01:50:22.892
The Air Force cancelled
the contract on the Hercules.

01:50:22.996 --> 01:50:28.687
The war's over now,
and they say they don't need it any more.

01:50:28.792 --> 01:50:33.403
I have to know what you want me to do.
Should I release the staff?

01:50:33.507 --> 01:50:35.507
How far...

01:50:36.005 --> 01:50:38.955
from finishing?

01:50:40.130 --> 01:50:42.871
- About six months.
- No, no.

01:50:42.976 --> 01:50:44.776
In money.

01:50:48.222 --> 01:50:52.302
Seven million.
Maybe more.

01:50:58.023 --> 01:50:59.823
Build it.

01:51:00.952 --> 01:51:03.952
Build it, Odie.

01:51:04.787 --> 01:51:06.187
Howard,

01:51:06.915 --> 01:51:10.941
a Constellation crashed
outside Reading, Pennsylvania.

01:51:11.045 --> 01:51:14.903
The Civil Aeronautics Board
has grounded the whole fleet.

01:51:24.841 --> 01:51:30.927
You know, Juan Trippe sent me flowers.

01:51:33.016 --> 01:51:35.092
Take a look.

01:51:38.605 --> 01:51:43.511
- What did you do with all the others?
- I had them taken out.

01:51:43.615 --> 01:51:46.813
They attract aphids.

01:51:47.823 --> 01:51:53.233
Aphids are...
They're just awful little creatures.

01:51:53.338 --> 01:51:54.538
But...

01:51:57.416 --> 01:51:59.492
But these ones...

01:52:00.669 --> 01:52:04.797
I wanted to see these ones every day.

01:52:11.889 --> 01:52:14.963
Can white elephants really fly?
That's everybody's question.

01:52:15.068 --> 01:52:17.838
It's the hull of the world's
mightiest airplane,

01:52:17.942 --> 01:52:20.300
a flying boat built
by Howard Hughes.

01:52:20.404 --> 01:52:24.553
220 feet long, it towers higher
than a five-storey building.

01:52:24.658 --> 01:52:28.724
Power lines have to be cut as it starts
the trip from Culver City, California,

01:52:28.828 --> 01:52:30.975
to the Pacific, 30 miles away.

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:34.399
Moving the 60-ton load
is quite an engineering problem.

01:52:34.503 --> 01:52:38.440
But you gotta ask, "Was anything this big
ever supposed to fly?"

01:52:38.544 --> 01:52:43.074
There goes one wing section.
160 feet long with four engine housings.

01:52:43.178 --> 01:52:46.577
Double that, and you've got
some idea of the wing spread.

01:52:46.682 --> 01:52:50.837
An airplane that challenges
a mountain for sheer size.

01:52:57.601 --> 01:52:59.921
How long can they keep us grounded?

01:53:00.025 --> 01:53:03.428
Till they finish investigating
the Reading crash. Could be months.

01:53:03.532 --> 01:53:08.179
Jesus. You're already running a
$14 million deficit. How you gonna afford...

01:53:08.283 --> 01:53:10.598
We go international,
we'll make it up.

01:53:10.703 --> 01:53:13.356
Look, Brewster's CAB bill
just isn't going away.

01:53:13.461 --> 01:53:16.046
That bill passes and you bought
all these goddamn planes for nothing.

01:53:16.151 --> 01:53:17.444
- We're fighting the CAB bill.
- Yeah.

01:53:17.548 --> 01:53:19.858
Meanwhile, how do you suggest
we keep TWA flying?

01:53:19.962 --> 01:53:21.844
And don't say, "Just go to Toolco,"
this time.

01:53:21.948 --> 01:53:24.388
As it is we're pumping every damn cent
we have into the Hercules,

01:53:24.492 --> 01:53:27.615
which, I might add,
the Air Force doesn't even want any more.

01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:30.540
Now look, Howard, I'm glad Jack here
is feeling so sunny about things,

01:53:30.644 --> 01:53:31.562
but I've seen the books.

01:53:31.666 --> 01:53:34.461
And I'm telling it to you straight,
I'm not just crying wolf this time,

01:53:34.565 --> 01:53:37.587
we're in serious trouble.
You've got to make a choice.

01:53:37.691 --> 01:53:43.057
You want to be bankrupted by
the big plane or by the big airline?

01:53:49.987 --> 01:53:53.727
Go see Thomas Parkinson
at the Equitable in New York.

01:53:53.831 --> 01:53:58.940
Get a loan against all the TWA equipment
and capital. Use the planes as collateral.

01:53:59.045 --> 01:54:03.489
Hell, use the desks, use the pens,
use everything we got.

01:54:03.593 --> 01:54:08.323
- Try to get me 40 million.
- And if TWA defaults on the loan?

01:54:08.427 --> 01:54:11.542
Well, then Juan Trippe buys us cheap.

01:54:13.844 --> 01:54:16.919
Under my bed. You put
a goddamn microphone under my bed.

01:54:17.023 --> 01:54:19.250
Honey, listen to me.
I am concerned about you, baby.

01:54:19.355 --> 01:54:22.879
- I just want to make sure you're OK.
- And who is in that car?

01:54:22.983 --> 01:54:25.380
That goddamn car
has been with me 24 hours a day.

01:54:25.485 --> 01:54:27.383
That car is there for your protection.

01:54:27.488 --> 01:54:30.929
The only one I need protection from is you,
you sick bastard.

01:54:31.033 --> 01:54:32.681
You don't own me, Howard.

01:54:32.786 --> 01:54:35.937
I'm not one of your teenage whores,
and I'm not some damn airplane.

01:54:36.041 --> 01:54:38.108
Now look, honey,
I'll have them take all the bugs out.

01:54:38.212 --> 01:54:40.485
You just have to understand
that I need to know where you are.

01:54:40.589 --> 01:54:43.195
- Why?
- Because I worry about you, that's why.

01:54:43.299 --> 01:54:45.099
Bullshit.

01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.086
What do you mean, all the bugs?

01:54:56.011 --> 01:54:58.716
What do you mean, all the bugs?

01:55:00.933 --> 01:55:02.964
There's more.

01:55:03.068 --> 01:55:04.868
How many?

01:55:05.279 --> 01:55:07.340
I don't know, 12.
12, maybe.

01:55:07.444 --> 01:55:11.844
And on the telephones.

01:55:11.995 --> 01:55:15.681
Oh, Christ, Howard, on the telephone?

01:55:15.785 --> 01:55:17.434
You listen to my phone calls?

01:55:17.539 --> 01:55:21.395
No, no, no, honey. I would never do that.
I'd never do that. I...

01:55:21.499 --> 01:55:24.662
I just read the transcripts, that's all.

01:55:29.044 --> 01:55:31.324
What do you want to know, Howard?

01:55:31.429 --> 01:55:33.658
Was I screwing Artie Shaw last night?

01:55:33.762 --> 01:55:36.537
Was I screwing Sinatra the night before?
You bet.

01:55:36.641 --> 01:55:39.294
Everyone told me you were
a goddamn lunatic but I didn't listen.

01:55:39.398 --> 01:55:42.379
It's no wonder Kate Hepburn
dumped your demented ass.

01:55:42.483 --> 01:55:44.431
Shut your goddamn mouth.

01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:52.309
Get out, you pathetic freak.

01:55:59.950 --> 01:56:01.550
Get out.

01:56:02.085 --> 01:56:04.025
Is everything all right, sir?

01:56:04.129 --> 01:56:07.324
Take out all the bugs.

01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.781
Except for the one on the bedroom phone.

01:56:10.885 --> 01:56:13.962
Sir, the FBI are at the house.

01:56:14.965 --> 01:56:17.926
This is outrageous. Everything in these
offices is the private property

01:56:18.051 --> 01:56:21.043
of Hughes Productions.
My legal counsel is on the way...

01:56:21.147 --> 01:56:25.088
Federal warrant.
Don't interfere with this search, sir.

01:56:44.244 --> 01:56:47.568
Dateline Los Angeles.
Howard Hughes has a new house guest.

01:56:47.673 --> 01:56:51.443
No, it's not another beautiful starlet
this time. It's the FBI.

01:56:51.547 --> 01:56:53.158
Noah, you have got to help, all right?

01:56:53.263 --> 01:56:55.573
This is the tenth goddamn time
they have been here.

01:56:55.678 --> 01:56:59.163
Rumour has it that federal agents working
for Senator Ralph Owen Brewster

01:56:59.268 --> 01:57:03.166
have practically taken up residence
in the aviation mogul's Hollywood home.

01:57:03.271 --> 01:57:07.964
Look, they are touching things.
Noah, Noah, they are touching things.

01:57:08.068 --> 01:57:12.094
Just keep yourself calm and I'll be
down there as soon as I can, Howard.

01:57:12.198 --> 01:57:15.059
Howard?
Howard?

01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:42.331
Howard, hello.

01:57:42.436 --> 01:57:45.790
- Owen, nice to see you again.
- Good to see you. Come on inside.

01:57:45.894 --> 01:57:48.503
- Emma, you can start the lunch now.
- Yes, sir.

01:57:48.608 --> 01:57:53.173
Well, really lovely room.
Nicely decorated.

01:57:53.277 --> 01:57:55.136
Thank you.
Here, have a seat.

01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:56.608
- Thanks.
- Thanks for coming by.

01:57:56.733 --> 01:57:59.763
I just thought you and I should have
a chance to talk privately.

01:57:59.868 --> 01:58:02.892
You know, outside the office.

01:58:02.996 --> 01:58:04.396
Well...

01:58:05.753 --> 01:58:07.782
I appreciate that, Owen.

01:58:15.085 --> 01:58:20.746
So, you're coming out pretty strong
against the CAB bill.

01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:26.124
- You're coming on pretty strong for it.
- Well, it's my bill, Howard. You know?

01:58:26.228 --> 01:58:28.919
Look, I believe sincerely that

01:58:29.023 --> 01:58:33.310
America cannot afford to have
more than one international carrier.

01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:39.969
So, do you think it's fair that one airline
should have a monopoly on...

01:58:40.074 --> 01:58:43.681
A monopoly? No, no, no.
No, no, no. Oh, no.

01:58:43.786 --> 01:58:49.313
No, I think one airline could do it better,
see, without competition.

01:58:49.417 --> 01:58:54.195
All I'm thinking about are the interests,
the needs of the American passenger.

01:58:54.299 --> 01:58:57.292
That's just beautiful.
What is that?

01:59:01.506 --> 01:59:03.827
What is that?
Is that a...

01:59:03.931 --> 01:59:06.917
Is that a yak?
Some kind of a yak?

01:59:07.021 --> 01:59:11.130
No, that's a llama. My wife picked that up
when we were in Peru a year ago.

01:59:11.234 --> 01:59:14.640
Son of a gun.
A real llama.

01:59:17.105 --> 01:59:20.014
- From Peru?
- Yeah. A year ago.

01:59:20.118 --> 01:59:22.556
Yeah, it was about a year ago.

01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:24.889
- Lunch is served, Senator.
- Good. OK.

01:59:24.994 --> 01:59:27.610
Come on, let's go have some lunch.

01:59:28.659 --> 01:59:32.604
Now did you...
Did you actually get to see any llamas?

01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:34.652
No, no.
My wife just liked the painting.

01:59:34.756 --> 01:59:38.527
It's a hell of an interesting animal.
I'll have to read up on those.

01:59:38.631 --> 01:59:43.366
How do you spell that?
Like Fernando Lamas?

01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:45.868
No, no, no. It's...

01:59:45.972 --> 01:59:49.171
It's the animal. It's got two Ls.
Here, come on, have a seat.

01:59:59.147 --> 02:00:02.516
It's brook trout.
Hope you like fish.

02:00:04.152 --> 02:00:05.973
I love it.

02:00:06.077 --> 02:00:07.477
Thanks.

02:00:22.963 --> 02:00:27.126
I know you're not a drinking man,
so I hope water's OK.

02:00:39.897 --> 02:00:41.297
Thanks.

02:00:47.154 --> 02:00:51.560
All right, let's get down to business.
Let's talk turkey.

02:00:51.665 --> 02:00:54.772
My investigators...

02:00:54.876 --> 02:00:58.111
My investigators
have turned up a lot of dirt.

02:00:58.215 --> 02:01:02.069
Could be really embarrassing
if this stuff got out.

02:01:02.173 --> 02:01:05.864
I'd like to save you
from that embarrassment.

02:01:05.968 --> 02:01:08.206
That's very kind of you, Owen.

02:01:11.136 --> 02:01:14.968
My committee has the power
to hold public hearings.

02:01:16.516 --> 02:01:19.047
I'd like to spare you that.

02:01:19.151 --> 02:01:21.591
Would you, now?

02:01:21.696 --> 02:01:22.696
Look.

02:01:23.324 --> 02:01:28.099
Do you want to go down in history
as a war profiteer, Howard?

02:01:28.203 --> 02:01:30.816
Is that what you want?

02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:34.660
What do you want, Owen?

02:01:35.786 --> 02:01:42.030
You agree to support my CAB bill
and I won't hold public hearings.

02:01:42.134 --> 02:01:43.779
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

02:01:43.883 --> 02:01:47.701
I can't do that, Owen.
The CAB would kill TWA.

02:01:47.805 --> 02:01:51.411
Sell TWA to Pan Am.

02:01:51.515 --> 02:01:55.666
You'll get a good price.
You'll get a fair price, I'm telling you.

02:01:55.770 --> 02:01:57.962
And then?
Then you won't go public?

02:01:58.066 --> 02:02:03.047
Right. That's right. The investigation's
closed. Nobody knows a thing.

02:02:03.152 --> 02:02:06.515
It's better for everybody.

02:02:10.779 --> 02:02:12.727
You know, Owen, I'm...

02:02:12.831 --> 02:02:14.783
- I'm still wondering one thing.
- What's that?

02:02:14.908 --> 02:02:18.271
You know the picture of the llama
you got last year?

02:02:18.375 --> 02:02:21.122
- Yeah.
- Where'd you sail from?

02:02:21.874 --> 02:02:23.866
We didn't sail.
We flew.

02:02:25.127 --> 02:02:27.534
- You flew?
- Yeah.

02:02:35.137 --> 02:02:38.999
Are you sure you want to do this, Owen?

02:02:39.103 --> 02:02:41.637
You want to go to war with me?

02:02:46.356 --> 02:02:51.511
It isn't me, Howard.
It's the United States government.

02:02:51.616 --> 02:02:54.725
We just beat Germany and Japan.

02:02:54.829 --> 02:02:57.030
Who the hell are you?

02:03:02.206 --> 02:03:07.322
You tell Juan Trippe something for me,
all right?

02:03:07.426 --> 02:03:10.366
Tell him thanks for the flowers.

02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:15.885
And he can kiss both sides of my ass.

02:03:39.785 --> 02:03:42.271
Well, we have a long list of particulars.

02:03:42.375 --> 02:03:46.777
Chief among them is that
he defrauded the American government

02:03:46.881 --> 02:03:50.450
of $56 million while we were at war,
when we could least afford it.

02:03:50.554 --> 02:03:53.620
While brave men were dying
on the beaches of Normandy,

02:03:53.725 --> 02:03:56.623
Mr Hughes was picking the pocket
of the American taxpayer.

02:03:56.728 --> 02:03:58.128
I sleep

02:03:59.564 --> 02:04:04.564
in this room in the dark.

02:04:05.026 --> 02:04:08.048
I'll have him dragged here
to Washington if I have to.

02:04:08.153 --> 02:04:10.383
I want to see the whites of his lies.

02:04:10.487 --> 02:04:14.972
I have a place where I sleep.

02:04:15.076 --> 02:04:18.184
- He has a lot of questions to answer.
- I have a chair.

02:04:18.288 --> 02:04:23.231
Particularly about that
monstrous boondoggle of his.

02:04:23.336 --> 02:04:28.112
That model airplane he's building.
You know, that flying lumberyard.

02:04:28.217 --> 02:04:31.366
That Spruce Goose.

02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:34.213
No, we'll get him here.

02:04:37.259 --> 02:04:41.166
That's just beautiful.

02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:43.505
I like the desert.

02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:50.723
It's hot there in the desert, but it's clean.
It's clean.

02:04:52.858 --> 02:04:55.693
I need to sleep.

02:04:57.946 --> 02:05:01.362
I should drink something first.

02:05:04.578 --> 02:05:06.903
I should drink something first.

02:05:11.126 --> 02:05:13.926
Wait a minute.

02:05:14.138 --> 02:05:16.870
What if that milk is sour?

02:05:16.975 --> 02:05:19.285
If that milk is bad,

02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:24.751
I shouldn't pick up the bottle of milk
with my right hand,

02:05:24.855 --> 02:05:30.684
and I shouldn't take the top off
with my left hand.

02:05:32.022 --> 02:05:35.263
Put it in my pocket.

02:05:35.367 --> 02:05:37.435
My left pocket.

02:05:54.711 --> 02:05:56.576
Howard, it's Kate.

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:59.079
I need to talk to you.

02:06:00.217 --> 02:06:02.209
Can you hear me?

02:06:04.596 --> 02:06:07.134
I'm coming in.

02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:14.272
Howard, unlock this door immediately.

02:06:22.614 --> 02:06:25.651
I can't, sweetie.

02:06:28.036 --> 02:06:30.610
You mean you won't.

02:06:31.832 --> 02:06:35.655
Howard, please let me see you.

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:37.655
I haven't shaved.

02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:40.708
Well, neither have I.

02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:45.360
Come on.

02:06:45.896 --> 02:06:48.696
You let me in.

02:06:55.689 --> 02:06:59.513
I can hear you, Katie.

02:06:59.617 --> 02:07:04.848
I could always hear you.
Even in the cockpit, with the engines on.

02:07:04.952 --> 02:07:08.697
Well, that's because I'm so goddamn loud.

02:07:13.999 --> 02:07:16.075
Howard, I...

02:07:18.212 --> 02:07:21.120
I came to thank you.

02:07:21.224 --> 02:07:24.577
I found out what you did
for Spence and me.

02:07:24.682 --> 02:07:27.428
Buying those awful pictures.

02:07:32.559 --> 02:07:34.303
You love him.

02:07:40.984 --> 02:07:43.558
He's everything I have.

02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:53.020
Howard.

02:07:54.632 --> 02:07:57.956
I'm glad for you, Kate.

02:07:58.502 --> 02:08:01.948
Go away now.
Would you do that?

02:08:02.052 --> 02:08:04.162
Howard, please.

02:08:04.266 --> 02:08:09.207
Go away.
Just for now. I'll see you soon.

02:08:09.312 --> 02:08:11.707
- We'll go flying together.
- Yes.

02:08:11.811 --> 02:08:14.753
Yes, please.
You take me flying again.

02:08:14.858 --> 02:08:18.018
Howard, I can take the wheel.

02:08:23.652 --> 02:08:25.052
Howard?

02:08:31.577 --> 02:08:34.281
Howard, are you there?

02:08:39.334 --> 02:08:40.734
Howard?

02:08:42.838 --> 02:08:45.245
Howard, are you there?

02:08:47.259 --> 02:08:49.335
Come on, Howard.

02:08:52.264 --> 02:08:54.837
Howard, are you there?

02:09:20.334 --> 02:09:22.320
Come in with the milk.
Come in with the milk.

02:09:22.424 --> 02:09:26.076
Come in with the milk. Come in with
the milk. Come in with the milk.

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:27.327
Come in with the milk.

02:09:27.431 --> 02:09:30.703
He is to open the bag with his right hand

02:09:30.808 --> 02:09:33.999
and hold the bag out to me
at a 45-degree angle

02:09:34.104 --> 02:09:39.336
so I may reach
into the bag without...

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:43.054
without touching the paper.

02:09:46.652 --> 02:09:49.182
Repeated from the beginning.

02:09:49.287 --> 02:09:53.740
Repeated from the beginning.
Repeated from the beginning.

02:10:04.670 --> 02:10:12.328
If there is any variation of these
instructions, even to the smallest degree,

02:10:12.433 --> 02:10:18.543
the entire process
must be repeated from the beginning.

02:10:18.647 --> 02:10:20.545
- Come in with the milk.
- Repeated...

02:10:20.649 --> 02:10:22.573
- Come in with the milk.
...from the beginning.

02:10:22.677 --> 02:10:25.970
- Come in with the milk.
- Repeated from the beginning.

02:10:26.074 --> 02:10:30.139
- Repeated from the beginning.
- Come in with the milk.

02:10:30.243 --> 02:10:31.043
Q...

02:10:34.283 --> 02:10:35.083
R...

02:10:35.708 --> 02:10:36.508
N...

02:10:39.121 --> 02:10:39.921
T...

02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:42.389
Q...

02:10:44.877 --> 02:10:45.677
U...

02:10:48.630 --> 02:10:49.430
E...

02:10:51.842 --> 02:10:52.642
I...

02:10:54.226 --> 02:10:55.026
T...

02:10:57.222 --> 02:10:58.022
I...

02:10:59.313 --> 02:11:00.113
N...

02:11:02.026 --> 02:11:02.826
E...

02:11:04.692 --> 02:11:05.492
N...

02:11:07.774 --> 02:11:08.574
E...

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:09.600
E.

02:11:11.495 --> 02:11:12.295
I...

02:11:24.082 --> 02:11:25.482
Howard?

02:11:28.045 --> 02:11:29.245
Hello?

02:11:31.882 --> 02:11:36.045
- Who is it?
- Howard, it's Juan.

02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:44.310
Juan.

02:11:46.489 --> 02:11:48.882
Juan, right. Yeah.

02:11:48.986 --> 02:11:51.680
We had an appointment, right? Yeah.

02:11:51.784 --> 02:11:54.807
I remember that. Look...

02:11:54.911 --> 02:11:57.519
I've got a hell of a cold in here.
A hell of a cold.

02:11:57.623 --> 02:11:59.316
So why don't you just take
a seat out there?

02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:01.354
Cos you know,
I don't want to get you sick.

02:12:01.458 --> 02:12:07.705
I'd never forgive myself if I got you sick.
I don't want to get you sick. I don't want to...

02:12:14.007 --> 02:12:16.007
Thank you.

02:12:18.428 --> 02:12:20.831
OK, Howard, I'm sitting.

02:12:20.935 --> 02:12:23.046
I've brought along our accountings.

02:12:23.150 --> 02:12:27.381
Now, Pan Am is trading
at 13 and five-eighths.

02:12:27.485 --> 02:12:30.220
TWA at four and a quarter...

02:12:30.325 --> 02:12:31.802
Come on.

02:12:31.906 --> 02:12:34.386
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:39.475
We both know I'm not gonna sell TWA.
Besides, you couldn't afford her anyway.

02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:43.942
Our domestic routes alone
are worth more than twice Pan Am.

02:12:44.047 --> 02:12:47.112
Well, considering our stock
is trading at three times yours,

02:12:47.217 --> 02:12:50.448
I find that a dubious claim, Howard.

02:12:50.552 --> 02:12:52.352
What I...

02:12:54.172 --> 02:12:58.790
What I mean is,
you have no domestic routes. All right?

02:12:58.894 --> 02:13:01.122
I mean, you get TWA,
you span the globe.

02:13:01.226 --> 02:13:04.213
Now, I'm not gonna sell,
and you know I'm not gonna sell.

02:13:04.317 --> 02:13:08.601
Here's the point.
Owen Brewster works for you.

02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:15.481
Howard, I didn't elect Senator Brewster.
We can thank the voters of Maine for that.

02:13:22.534 --> 02:13:28.112
Now, if I appear at his hearings, Juan,
it could get nasty.

02:13:28.216 --> 02:13:30.443
Real nasty for all of us.

02:13:30.547 --> 02:13:35.114
Well, I think considerably more so for you.

02:13:35.219 --> 02:13:38.244
While the good people of America
were losing sons at Anzio,

02:13:38.348 --> 02:13:42.414
you produced a dirty movie
and built airplanes that don't fly.

02:13:42.519 --> 02:13:45.082
Well, that's just not fair, is it?

02:13:45.186 --> 02:13:49.172
I mean, the XF-11 flew quite well
for an hour and 45 minutes.

02:13:49.277 --> 02:13:54.219
I mean, I wish you were up there with me,
Juan. It was exhilarating.

02:13:54.323 --> 02:13:58.434
Be that as it may, you still have
to answer for the Spruce Goose.

02:13:58.538 --> 02:14:01.059
It's called the Hercules.

02:14:01.163 --> 02:14:05.018
- And it will fly, goddamn it.
- I certainly hope so.

02:14:05.123 --> 02:14:08.693
The American people deserve something
for their $13 million.

02:14:08.797 --> 02:14:11.902
I won't sell TWA.

02:14:12.007 --> 02:14:13.245
I won't.

02:14:18.090 --> 02:14:20.831
I know that, Howard.

02:14:20.935 --> 02:14:23.002
I know that.

02:14:24.388 --> 02:14:27.879
But I'm going to get it anyway.

02:14:27.983 --> 02:14:30.377
You're going to default on
your loan from Equitable

02:14:30.481 --> 02:14:32.758
after Senator Brewster
destroys your reputation

02:14:32.862 --> 02:14:36.262
and you can't find additional capital
for the airline.

02:14:36.366 --> 02:14:39.849
The hearings will also show
Hughes Aircraft to be mismanaged

02:14:39.953 --> 02:14:44.063
and incompetent,
and it will go bankrupt, too.

02:14:44.167 --> 02:14:47.732
But you won't be insolvent.
You'll still have Toolco.

02:14:47.836 --> 02:14:51.862
Perhaps you'll head back to Houston
to rebuild your empire.

02:14:51.966 --> 02:14:54.404
I rather hope you do.

02:14:54.508 --> 02:14:57.115
By that time,
Pan Am will have bought TWA

02:14:57.219 --> 02:15:02.035
and painted all those
magnificent Connies blue and white.

02:15:02.139 --> 02:15:07.128
So when you do return,
it will be on a Pan Am plane.

02:15:10.601 --> 02:15:12.001
Well...

02:15:14.187 --> 02:15:18.011
You seem to have me
in a corner here, buddy.

02:15:18.115 --> 02:15:22.236
Not a position in which
I'm very comfortable.

02:15:23.113 --> 02:15:27.980
I think you're gonna be less comfortable
at Senator Brewster's hearings.

02:15:28.085 --> 02:15:31.695
Very public, Howard.

02:15:32.456 --> 02:15:35.863
Lots of cameras and newsmen.

02:15:35.968 --> 02:15:40.538
I understand you're not
particularly fond of crowds.

02:15:41.590 --> 02:15:44.793
Perhaps we should spare you that.

02:15:46.762 --> 02:15:51.668
Well, thank you for your concern, Juan.

02:15:51.772 --> 02:15:53.972
I find that

02:15:54.946 --> 02:15:57.346
very moving.

02:15:57.821 --> 02:16:00.056
It's been a real pleasure.

02:16:01.568 --> 02:16:05.514
Noah will see you back to the airport.
Now you...

02:16:05.618 --> 02:16:07.192
You fly safe.

02:16:10.786 --> 02:16:13.193
You fly safe.

02:16:18.043 --> 02:16:20.097
Thank you, Howard.
And you take care of that cold.

02:16:20.201 --> 02:16:22.868
Don't you worry.

02:16:22.972 --> 02:16:26.078
I certainly will.

02:16:26.182 --> 02:16:27.782
Bye-bye.

02:16:32.432 --> 02:16:37.338
If you let him appear at those hearings,
the whole world will see what he's become.

02:16:37.442 --> 02:16:40.557
People should remember him as he was.

02:16:45.529 --> 02:16:50.146
He'll have a subpoena in three days
to appear in Washington.

02:16:50.250 --> 02:16:52.994
If you can get him out of there by then.

02:17:42.710 --> 02:17:44.668
Mr Hughes?

02:17:50.593 --> 02:17:53.084
I don't have any shoes.

02:17:54.848 --> 02:17:57.710
- Could you get me some shoes?
- Shoes.

02:17:57.816 --> 02:17:58.816
Yeah.

02:18:25.379 --> 02:18:28.083
How nice of you to dress for me.

02:18:31.218 --> 02:18:33.459
Can I come in?

02:18:34.012 --> 02:18:37.713
Yeah. Yeah.
You can come in.

02:18:45.398 --> 02:18:47.937
Thank you for coming.

02:18:59.745 --> 02:19:01.900
Now, let's get a drink.

02:19:02.004 --> 02:19:04.990
Wait, wait, wait, honey.
You can't move. You can't move.

02:19:05.093 --> 02:19:09.492
You're safe here. You're in the germ-free
zone now. You understand?

02:19:09.596 --> 02:19:13.285
- I'll take my chances.
- Oh, no. No, no, honey.

02:19:13.388 --> 02:19:15.958
Wait, wait, wait.

02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:32.147
Love what you've done with the place.

02:19:37.367 --> 02:19:41.531
Now, let me look at you.

02:19:46.126 --> 02:19:49.034
When do you go to Washington?

02:19:49.138 --> 02:19:50.538
A week.

02:19:51.136 --> 02:19:53.368
No, no.
Just under a week.

02:19:53.472 --> 02:19:58.834
I don't know the date today,
but I have to be... I have to be...

02:19:58.938 --> 02:20:01.386
All right, take it easy.

02:20:14.363 --> 02:20:17.150
There's nothing there, Howard.

02:20:19.034 --> 02:20:19.634
Mm.

02:20:23.872 --> 02:20:27.455
You know, I...
I see things.

02:20:28.293 --> 02:20:30.784
I know, baby.

02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:33.668
Rinse your face off now.

02:20:42.558 --> 02:20:45.088
Put your hands in the water
and wash off the soap.

02:20:45.192 --> 02:20:48.554
I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

02:20:52.943 --> 02:20:56.389
- Does that look clean to you?
- Nothing's clean, Howard.

02:20:56.493 --> 02:20:59.608
But we do our best, right?

02:21:00.325 --> 02:21:01.325
Yeah.

02:21:21.305 --> 02:21:24.380
- What do you think?
- I look all right?

02:21:24.484 --> 02:21:26.672
You look great.

02:21:26.777 --> 02:21:30.469
- Will you marry me?
- You're too crazy for me.

02:21:32.941 --> 02:21:36.182
I gotta go, baby.

02:21:36.286 --> 02:21:36.886
OK.

02:21:38.663 --> 02:21:40.063
Thanks.

02:21:46.371 --> 02:21:48.945
You'd do it for me.

02:21:54.796 --> 02:21:57.085
Hi, Howard.
How are you doing?

02:22:37.714 --> 02:22:40.539
The Committee will come to order.

02:22:40.643 --> 02:22:45.501
Ladies and gentlemen, I must insist that we
maintain quiet during these proceedings.

02:22:45.606 --> 02:22:49.429
All right, Mr Hughes,
will you stand to be sworn?

02:22:50.727 --> 02:22:54.634
Do you solemnly swear that in the matter
now pending before this committee,

02:22:54.739 --> 02:22:59.016
you will tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:01.513
- I do.
- Pardon me for speaking loudly,

02:23:01.617 --> 02:23:03.977
but I understand
you have some difficulty hearing.

02:23:04.081 --> 02:23:09.069
That's quite all right. Everybody knows
I'm deaf. I'm not gonna try to hide it.

02:23:12.249 --> 02:23:14.735
Mr Hughes,
it is the intention of this committee...

02:23:14.839 --> 02:23:17.782
Mr Hughes has a statement.

02:23:17.886 --> 02:23:23.965
All right. All right. You may proceed
with this statement, Mr Hughes.

02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:33.469
Mr Hughes, do you have a statement?

02:23:39.818 --> 02:23:44.195
I'm gonna attempt to be honest here.

02:23:44.865 --> 02:23:50.526
My reputation's being destroyed, so I might
as well lay the cards on the table.

02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:54.944
Senator Brewster,
if you hadn't have gone too far overboard,

02:23:55.048 --> 02:23:57.611
if you hadn't have put
the red-hot iron in my side,

02:23:57.715 --> 02:24:02.283
I might have been willing to take a
shellacking in this publicity spree of yours.

02:24:02.388 --> 02:24:05.745
I might have been willing to sit back
and take a certain amount of abuse.

02:24:05.849 --> 02:24:08.624
Simply because, well...

02:24:08.728 --> 02:24:11.381
Well, I am only a private citizen,

02:24:11.485 --> 02:24:16.350
whereas you are a senator,
with all sorts of powers.

02:24:17.522 --> 02:24:20.302
But I think this goddamn circus
has gone on long enough.

02:24:20.407 --> 02:24:21.721
That's quite sufficient.

02:24:21.826 --> 02:24:24.643
You have called me a liar, sir, in the press.

02:24:24.747 --> 02:24:27.730
You have called me a liar
and a thief and a war profiteer.

02:24:27.834 --> 02:24:31.942
- The witness will restrain his comments...
- Why not tell the truth for once, Senator?

02:24:32.046 --> 02:24:35.234
Why not tell the truth
that this investigation was really born

02:24:35.338 --> 02:24:38.362
on the day that TWA
first decided to fly to Europe?

02:24:38.466 --> 02:24:41.784
On the day that TWA
first invaded Juan Trippe's territory.

02:24:41.889 --> 02:24:43.245
Sit down, Mr Hughes.

02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:46.870
On the day that TWA first challenged
the generally accepted theory

02:24:46.974 --> 02:24:49.666
that only Juan Trippe's
great Pan American Airways

02:24:49.770 --> 02:24:55.002
- had the sacred right to fly the Atlantic.
- You are not here to make a speech.

02:24:55.106 --> 02:24:58.509
I asked for silence.
I asked for quiet in this room...

02:24:58.614 --> 02:25:03.428
We have in our possession receipts
in the amount of $170,000

02:25:03.532 --> 02:25:05.641
acquired from Mr John Meyer.

02:25:05.746 --> 02:25:08.223
Mr Meyer works for you,
does he not?

02:25:08.327 --> 02:25:13.273
- He does.
- And what is his official title?

02:25:13.377 --> 02:25:17.232
Well, I don't exactly know, Senator.
A lot of people work for me.

02:25:17.336 --> 02:25:22.782
Can you explain why your press agent
would pay out more than a $170,000

02:25:22.886 --> 02:25:25.327
to representatives of
the United States Air Force?

02:25:25.431 --> 02:25:28.204
I don't know.
I suppose you'd have to ask him, Senator.

02:25:28.308 --> 02:25:32.209
- Well, would you produce him?
- Produce him?

02:25:32.313 --> 02:25:34.459
- Will you cause him to appear?
- Well, Senator,

02:25:34.563 --> 02:25:37.421
you had John Meyer on
the stand for three days last week.

02:25:37.525 --> 02:25:43.937
Well, be that as it may, we would like him
to reappear. Would you ask him to return?

02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:53.602
No, I don't think I will.

02:25:53.706 --> 02:25:56.110
Will you try to have him return?

02:25:57.372 --> 02:26:01.029
Well, no, I don't think I'll try.

02:26:01.133 --> 02:26:03.582
You don't think you'll try?

02:26:04.546 --> 02:26:07.704
No, I don't think so.

02:26:07.808 --> 02:26:12.583
The $170,000 paid out to the Air Force
in the form of hotel suites,

02:26:12.688 --> 02:26:14.688
TWA stock,

02:26:14.937 --> 02:26:17.590
female companionship...

02:26:17.695 --> 02:26:22.062
Now, is it possible
that these could be considered bribes?

02:26:22.564 --> 02:26:26.139
I suppose you could call them that, yes.

02:26:26.243 --> 02:26:28.515
Would you repeat that?

02:26:28.619 --> 02:26:32.610
I said, I suppose you could
consider them bribes, yes.

02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:38.690
Well, would you like
to explain that, Mr Hughes?

02:26:38.794 --> 02:26:43.944
Well, I'm afraid you don't know how
the aviation business works, Senator.

02:26:44.048 --> 02:26:48.661
See, wining and dining Air Force
dignitaries is common in our business.

02:26:48.765 --> 02:26:52.581
It's because we all want the big contracts.
All the major aircraft companies do it.

02:26:52.685 --> 02:26:57.046
Now, I don't know whether it's a good
system or not. I just know it's not illegal.

02:26:57.150 --> 02:27:00.337
You, Senator, you are the lawmaker.

02:27:00.442 --> 02:27:03.760
If you pass a law that states
no one can entertain Air Force officers,

02:27:03.864 --> 02:27:07.556
well, hell,
I'd be happy to abide by it.

02:27:09.486 --> 02:27:11.556
Senator Brewster,
your story is a pack of lies,

02:27:11.660 --> 02:27:14.186
and I can tear it apart
if allowed to cross-examine you.

02:27:14.290 --> 02:27:16.685
- We're not gonna have this bickering...
- Yes.

02:27:16.789 --> 02:27:19.402
Somewhere between two and five hundred,
if you'll just let me...

02:27:19.507 --> 02:27:22.234
Now, if you believe that
because of your great wealth and power,

02:27:22.339 --> 02:27:24.818
you can intimidate
any member of this committee,

02:27:24.922 --> 02:27:26.783
I want to advise you that you're mistaken.

02:27:26.887 --> 02:27:29.871
- Now, submit your questions to the chair.
- Now, I'll put this very simply.

02:27:29.975 --> 02:27:33.122
On February 12th at the Mayflower Hotel,

02:27:33.227 --> 02:27:38.879
did you, or did you not, tell me
that if I were to sell TWA to Pan Am

02:27:38.983 --> 02:27:41.799
that this entire investigation
would be called off?

02:27:41.903 --> 02:27:45.717
No, I did not. I have asked you repeatedly
to submit your questions in writing.

02:27:45.821 --> 02:27:49.471
- How long have you known Juan Trippe?
- I've known Mr Trippe for some time now,

02:27:49.575 --> 02:27:51.305
and that's not the question here.

02:27:51.409 --> 02:27:55.937
Is it not true that Juan Trippe donated
$ 20,000 to your last campaign?

02:27:56.041 --> 02:27:59.395
I mean, he spoke to me
as if you worked for him.

02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:01.154
All right.

02:28:03.123 --> 02:28:04.927
I have a personal friendship
with Mr Trippe...

02:28:05.031 --> 02:28:08.530
Is it true that you accept free tickets
from Pan Am so you can circle the globe

02:28:08.634 --> 02:28:11.704
- in support of your CAB bill?
- No, no, it is not true.

02:28:11.808 --> 02:28:16.083
Well, who wrote that bill, Senator?
Who actually wrote the CAB bill?

02:28:16.187 --> 02:28:18.376
The actual words in the bill,
did you write them?

02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:21.152
This is not how these hearings
are gonna be conducted, Mr Hughes.

02:28:21.256 --> 02:28:24.421
I have it right here.
Maybe it'll refresh your memory.

02:28:24.526 --> 02:28:27.844
"Bill S-987,
to amend the Civil Aeronautics Act."

02:28:27.948 --> 02:28:31.807
Now, you introduced
this bill to the Senate.

02:28:34.738 --> 02:28:37.102
Lot of words.

02:28:37.206 --> 02:28:39.563
You write all of them?

02:28:39.667 --> 02:28:42.606
- Did you write any of them, Senator?
- Now look, Mr Hughes.

02:28:42.711 --> 02:28:45.862
Now, this entire bill
was written by Pan Am executives

02:28:45.966 --> 02:28:50.159
and designed to give that airline
a monopoly on international travel.

02:28:50.263 --> 02:28:53.494
And you've been flogging this bill
all around the world on their behalf,

02:28:53.599 --> 02:28:54.867
have you not?

02:28:54.971 --> 02:28:58.874
I have duties that take me
all over the world, Mr Hughes.

02:28:58.978 --> 02:29:04.048
Well, what the hell does a senator
from Maine need to visit Peru for?

02:29:04.601 --> 02:29:08.886
I was seeking outlets
for our trade goods.

02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:12.480
Buy a lot of lobsters down there,
do they?

02:29:15.821 --> 02:29:19.184
Senator Brewster, how many times
have you visited Juan Trippe's office

02:29:19.288 --> 02:29:23.411
in New York in the last three months?

02:29:24.913 --> 02:29:27.700
Would you like me to tell you, Senator?

02:29:28.292 --> 02:29:31.738
All right, this has gone on long enough.
Juan Trippe is a great American.

02:29:31.842 --> 02:29:35.660
His airline has advanced the cause
of commercial aviation in this country

02:29:35.765 --> 02:29:38.038
for decades.
Juan Trippe is a patriot.

02:29:38.142 --> 02:29:41.468
Juan Trippe is not a man
who is interested in making money.

02:29:42.931 --> 02:29:46.134
Well, I'm sure his stockholders
will be happy to hear that.

02:29:48.312 --> 02:29:50.304
I'm telling you,
we're gonna clear this room.

02:29:51.398 --> 02:29:52.785
This is James McNamara
speaking to you

02:29:52.889 --> 02:29:57.097
from aboard the Howard Hughes 2000-ton
flying boat, the world's largest aircraft.

02:29:57.202 --> 02:29:59.765
This is the sky giant
which has prompted Congress

02:29:59.869 --> 02:30:02.562
to investigate
the war contracts of Mr Hughes.

02:30:02.667 --> 02:30:05.484
Today, before boarding the craft,
Mr Hughes told newsmen

02:30:05.588 --> 02:30:08.320
that this test would
be solely a taxi experiment.

02:30:08.424 --> 02:30:10.401
He said he didn't know
what might happen.

02:30:10.506 --> 02:30:13.159
He pointed out that the mammoth
flying plywood shell

02:30:13.264 --> 02:30:17.160
might ship some water under high-speed
taxi pressure. He said definitely, however,

02:30:17.265 --> 02:30:20.748
that he would not take the craft into the air
until next spring.

02:30:20.852 --> 02:30:24.917
The thin man from Culver City pronounced
the craft an unknown quantity.

02:30:25.021 --> 02:30:26.585
Hi, boys.

02:30:26.690 --> 02:30:28.446
All right, none of that, now.
None of that.

02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:31.798
As we speak to you, we're about
five feet in back of Mr Hughes,

02:30:31.902 --> 02:30:35.804
and we are looking through
one of the side windows in the cockpit.

02:30:35.908 --> 02:30:38.560
Professor, why don't you
come on up front here?

02:30:38.664 --> 02:30:42.228
In other words,
we are 30 feet high in this aircraft.

02:30:42.332 --> 02:30:45.212
Strap yourself in right there.
You ought to be able to see just great.

02:30:45.317 --> 02:30:47.899
...just how gigantic this ship is.

02:30:48.004 --> 02:30:51.237
Huge crowds jammed
the surrounding shoreline this morning...

02:30:51.341 --> 02:30:54.667
All right, boys.
Let's fire it up.

02:30:58.423 --> 02:31:00.623
One's good.

02:31:01.097 --> 02:31:03.163
Two's good.

02:31:03.267 --> 02:31:04.960
Three's good.

02:31:05.064 --> 02:31:07.208
Four's good.

02:31:07.312 --> 02:31:09.128
Five's good.

02:31:09.232 --> 02:31:10.758
Six is good.

02:31:10.862 --> 02:31:12.301
Seven's good.

02:31:12.405 --> 02:31:15.005
Eight's good.

02:31:15.159 --> 02:31:20.681
- Advancing master throttles.
- Advancing master throttles.

02:31:20.785 --> 02:31:21.936
As you probably know by now,

02:31:22.041 --> 02:31:24.689
I have to do a great deal of screaming
here into my microphone.

02:31:24.794 --> 02:31:26.853
- Prop start up.
- Understood.

02:31:26.957 --> 02:31:30.942
- Lowering 15 degrees of flaps.
- Lowering 15 degrees of flaps.

02:31:31.047 --> 02:31:32.404
Howard.

02:31:32.509 --> 02:31:34.863
She's gotta hit 70
to have any kind of chance.

02:31:34.967 --> 02:31:36.742
Yeah, I know. I know.

02:31:36.846 --> 02:31:40.616
I might add that it's a beautiful day over
here off the coast of Southern California.

02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:43.246
Crystal blue skies, a warm sun...

02:31:43.351 --> 02:31:46.130
25 miles per hour.

02:31:47.264 --> 02:31:47.864
30.

02:31:49.521 --> 02:31:50.121
35.

02:31:50.897 --> 02:31:54.883
One would think these eight power plants
might shake the mighty craft to pieces.

02:31:54.987 --> 02:31:56.844
Take it easy, Howard.

02:31:56.949 --> 02:31:59.010
...and certainly, it's holding up...

02:31:59.114 --> 02:32:03.016
- 40.
- Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:06.862
Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

02:32:10.495 --> 02:32:13.275
The flight crew itself consists of four men.

02:32:13.380 --> 02:32:17.446
Mr Hughes, however, has added 11
maintenance men to this maiden taxi test,

02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:20.075
stationed at various places
throughout the ship,

02:32:20.179 --> 02:32:23.541
checking points of stress and strain.

02:32:25.594 --> 02:32:28.080
How does she sound, Odie?

02:32:28.184 --> 02:32:30.256
Sounds good, Howard.

02:32:33.352 --> 02:32:35.632
- Professor.
- Yes?

02:32:35.736 --> 02:32:38.009
Would you do me a favour?

02:32:38.114 --> 02:32:44.358
Would you take a look out that window
there and tell me what the wind is doing?

02:32:47.241 --> 02:32:51.148
I would say that we have
a 15-knot wind.

02:32:51.252 --> 02:32:55.242
Would you call that a headwind,
Professor?

02:32:55.832 --> 02:32:57.319
I would, Mr Hughes.

02:32:57.424 --> 02:32:59.737
I must insist that we maintain silence.

02:32:59.842 --> 02:33:01.823
We must have quiet during
these proceedings.

02:33:01.927 --> 02:33:04.369
All right, Mr Hughes,
will you stand to be sworn?

02:33:04.473 --> 02:33:08.245
Mr Hughes,
did you receive $43 million

02:33:08.349 --> 02:33:14.627
to manufacture one hundred XF-11
spy planes for the United States Air Force?

02:33:14.732 --> 02:33:15.919
I did.

02:33:16.023 --> 02:33:20.387
How many functional planes did you
deliver to the United States Air Force?

02:33:20.492 --> 02:33:21.492
None.

02:33:21.824 --> 02:33:25.474
Would you lean a little closer
to the microphone, sir?

02:33:25.578 --> 02:33:26.578
None.

02:33:26.913 --> 02:33:30.812
Did you receive $13 million to manufacture

02:33:30.917 --> 02:33:35.867
a prototype of a flying boat
known as the Hercules?

02:33:36.456 --> 02:33:37.656
I did.

02:33:38.759 --> 02:33:41.659
And did you deliver that plane?

02:33:41.763 --> 02:33:43.763
I did not.

02:33:44.011 --> 02:33:47.497
So, by your admission in this chamber,
Mr Hughes,

02:33:47.601 --> 02:33:52.793
you have received $56 million
from the United States government

02:33:52.897 --> 02:33:55.753
for planes you never delivered.

02:33:55.857 --> 02:33:58.721
That is correct.

02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:05.219
Well, excuse me for asking, Mr Hughes,
but where did all that money go?

02:34:05.323 --> 02:34:10.141
Well, it went into the plane, Senator,
and a lot more.

02:34:10.245 --> 02:34:15.146
More? Do tell, Mr Hughes.
What other larcenies did you commit?

02:34:15.250 --> 02:34:20.666
I mean, I put my money
into the plane, Senator. My money.

02:34:23.003 --> 02:34:24.824
- See, the thing is...
- Mr Hughes,

02:34:24.928 --> 02:34:27.701
your personal finances are not...

02:34:27.806 --> 02:34:30.551
Let him speak.

02:34:33.764 --> 02:34:37.088
All right, proceed, Mr Hughes.

02:34:37.192 --> 02:34:42.678
See, the thing is,
I care very much about aviation.

02:34:42.782 --> 02:34:46.635
It has been the great joy of my life. That's
why I put my own money into these planes.

02:34:46.739 --> 02:34:49.137
And I have lost millions, Senator Brewster.

02:34:49.242 --> 02:34:54.309
And I'll go on losing millions.
It's just what I do.

02:34:54.414 --> 02:34:58.188
Now, if I've lost a lot of the government's
money during the war,

02:34:58.292 --> 02:35:01.612
well, I hope folks
will put that into perspective.

02:35:01.717 --> 02:35:03.778
You see, more than 60 other airplanes,

02:35:03.882 --> 02:35:07.157
ordered from such firms as Lockheed,
Douglas, Northrop and Boeing,

02:35:07.261 --> 02:35:09.287
never saw action, either.

02:35:09.391 --> 02:35:15.998
In all, more than $800 million was spent
during the war on planes that never flew.

02:35:16.102 --> 02:35:20.466
Over six billion on other weapons
that were never delivered.

02:35:20.570 --> 02:35:25.844
Yet Hughes Aircraft, with her 56 million,

02:35:25.948 --> 02:35:28.600
is the only firm
under investigation here today.

02:35:28.704 --> 02:35:31.851
Now, I cannot help but think
that has a little more to do with TWA

02:35:31.955 --> 02:35:33.850
than planes that did not fly.

02:35:33.954 --> 02:35:36.857
- I think you've made your point...
- One second.

02:35:36.961 --> 02:35:41.070
Senator Brewster, I have one more thing
to say here to this committee,

02:35:41.174 --> 02:35:44.278
and that has to do with the Hercules.

02:35:44.382 --> 02:35:49.704
Now, I am supposed to be many things
which are not complimentary.

02:35:49.809 --> 02:35:51.951
I am supposed to be capricious.

02:35:52.056 --> 02:35:56.168
I have been called a playboy.
I've even been called an eccentric.

02:35:56.272 --> 02:36:01.213
But I do not believe that I have
the reputation of being a liar.

02:36:01.317 --> 02:36:04.884
Now, needless to say, the Hercules
was a monumental undertaking.

02:36:04.988 --> 02:36:07.721
It is the largest plane ever built.

02:36:07.826 --> 02:36:11.473
It's over five storeys tall,
with a wingspan longer than a football field.

02:36:11.577 --> 02:36:13.684
That's more than a city block.

02:36:13.789 --> 02:36:18.270
Now, I put the sweat of my life into this
thing, I got my reputation all rolled up in it,

02:36:18.375 --> 02:36:21.776
and I have stated several times
that if the Hercules fails to fly

02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:24.697
I will leave this country
and never come back.

02:36:24.801 --> 02:36:27.533
And I mean it.

02:36:27.637 --> 02:36:32.617
Now, Senator Brewster,
you can subpoena me. You can arrest me.

02:36:32.721 --> 02:36:37.955
You can even claim that I've folded up
and taken a run-out powder, but, well...

02:36:38.059 --> 02:36:41.711
I've had just about enough
of this nonsense. Good afternoon.

02:36:41.816 --> 02:36:43.424
I had to do it.

02:36:43.528 --> 02:36:46.638
Mr Hughes. Mr Hughes.

02:36:47.606 --> 02:36:50.303
I'd love to see the Hercules in the air.

02:36:50.408 --> 02:36:52.773
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

02:36:54.696 --> 02:36:57.816
Excuse us.
Excuse us, please. Thank you.

02:36:58.992 --> 02:37:01.281
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

02:37:01.828 --> 02:37:03.830
- Switch it off.
- The hearings aren't over yet.

02:37:03.956 --> 02:37:05.948
The hearings are over.

02:37:08.669 --> 02:37:11.577
The airline bill
will be defeated in the Senate.

02:37:11.681 --> 02:37:14.785
TWA will begin flights
from New York to Paris.

02:37:14.889 --> 02:37:19.675
Then on to Moscow, to Japan,
to Hawaii, to Los Angeles...

02:37:22.808 --> 02:37:24.884
to New York.

02:37:28.522 --> 02:37:29.522
Fuck.

02:37:34.319 --> 02:37:37.937
- Power coming up.
- Power coming up.

02:37:41.451 --> 02:37:43.982
Howard Hughes has just alerted us.

02:37:44.086 --> 02:37:49.779
He has asked everyone to hold on.
Tremendous horsepower picking up.

02:37:49.883 --> 02:37:53.911
- Let me hear it, Odie.
- 25 miles per hour.

02:37:54.015 --> 02:37:54.615
30.

02:37:55.386 --> 02:37:57.913
Here we go.
Here we go.

02:37:58.017 --> 02:37:58.617
35.

02:38:00.478 --> 02:38:04.000
...has moved up to 25. It's 30.

02:38:04.104 --> 02:38:06.463
- It's 35.
- 40.

02:38:06.567 --> 02:38:08.463
As he pushes the throttle, it's 40.

02:38:08.567 --> 02:38:12.930
- 45.
- 45. More throttle. It's 45.

02:38:13.034 --> 02:38:16.055
- 50.
- 50. It's 50 over a choppy sea.

02:38:16.159 --> 02:38:19.159
- 55.
- 55. 55.

02:38:19.787 --> 02:38:22.978
- 60.
- More throttle. It's 60.

02:38:23.083 --> 02:38:25.365
- 65.
- 65.

02:38:28.874 --> 02:38:30.860
- 70.
- It's 70.

02:38:30.964 --> 02:38:32.786
- 75.
- It's 75.

02:38:41.136 --> 02:38:43.750
And something momentarily
has just cut out.

02:38:43.854 --> 02:38:48.132
I believe we are airborne.
We are airborne, ladies and gentlemen.

02:38:48.236 --> 02:38:51.927
I don't believe that Howard Hughes
meant this to be. I don't know.

02:38:55.317 --> 02:39:00.773
And we're really up in the air.
We're really up in the air.

02:39:05.077 --> 02:39:08.523
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Hughes mammoth aircraft

02:39:08.627 --> 02:39:13.278
has flown this afternoon
in Los Angeles Harbour.

02:39:13.382 --> 02:39:16.574
It certainly looks, at this moment,
that Howard Hughes

02:39:16.678 --> 02:39:21.879
will be around the United States
for quite some time to come.

02:39:32.479 --> 02:39:35.593
What we must understand
is that technologies like these

02:39:35.697 --> 02:39:37.953
are the way of the future.
That's enough questions for now.

02:39:38.058 --> 02:39:40.768
TWA and Hughes Aircraft are delighted
to have you come here

02:39:40.872 --> 02:39:43.809
and witness this wonderful sight.

02:39:43.913 --> 02:39:46.144
- Excuse us for just a second.
- Sorry.

02:39:46.248 --> 02:39:48.396
- So you feel like going to Paris?
- Now?

02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:52.025
TWA is starting up flights to Europe.
Thought I might pilot the first one myself.

02:39:52.129 --> 02:39:54.194
Ought to be some fun.

02:39:54.298 --> 02:39:57.087
- Lots of good shopping in Paris.
- I'll buy you anything you want.

02:39:57.212 --> 02:40:02.202
You can buy me dinner.
How about that?

02:40:02.306 --> 02:40:04.870
Dinner, then.
We got a date?

02:40:04.974 --> 02:40:07.426
OK, baby, you got a date.

02:40:08.932 --> 02:40:12.839
I'll be back in a second.
But don't you go anywhere, now. I mean it.

02:40:12.944 --> 02:40:16.970
Al right, listen, boys. Something new. Jet
airplanes. You know anything about jets?

02:40:17.075 --> 02:40:22.810
- No. But it sounds expensive.
- It will be. But we got to get started.

02:40:22.914 --> 02:40:25.646
Come on, walk with me.

02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:29.315
Whoever can start utilising jet technology
on commercial airliners

02:40:29.419 --> 02:40:31.152
is gonna win all the marbles,
you understand?

02:40:31.257 --> 02:40:32.570
Odie, what do you know
about the science?

02:40:32.675 --> 02:40:37.574
I know a little. I can work something
to show you. Basic turbine stuff.

02:40:41.548 --> 02:40:45.048
Noah, who are those fellows?

02:40:46.261 --> 02:40:48.135
Do they work for me?

02:40:49.389 --> 02:40:51.762
Everybody works for you, Howard.

02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:01.078
Lockheed worked on the F-80,
so let's get Bob Gross on the phone.

02:41:01.182 --> 02:41:04.472
- See if he can help us out.
- OK. What, now?

02:41:04.576 --> 02:41:08.772
Of course, now. We gotta get into it.
Jets are gonna be the way of the future.

02:41:08.877 --> 02:41:10.021
It's 4:30.

02:41:10.126 --> 02:41:12.982
I talked to Bob last week.
He's in New York, so it's 7:30.

02:41:13.086 --> 02:41:14.273
He won't be in the office.

02:41:14.377 --> 02:41:16.364
We'll get Nancy
to figure out what hotel he's at.

02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:18.220
The question is,
do you want a telephone call

02:41:18.325 --> 02:41:20.055
or do you want
some kind of meeting right away?

02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:21.951
We want a meeting,
don't we, Howard?

02:41:22.055 --> 02:41:26.165
All right. Well, do you want me to bring
him out here tomorrow, then, Howard?

02:41:26.269 --> 02:41:28.918
- The way of the future.
- Howard?

02:41:29.023 --> 02:41:32.209
- Howard.
- The way of the future.

02:41:32.314 --> 02:41:35.087
- The way of the future.
- Let's take a walk, Howard.

02:41:35.191 --> 02:41:37.427
- The way of the future.
- Give me a hand here, will you, Glenn?

02:41:37.531 --> 02:41:40.678
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:41:40.782 --> 02:41:44.598
The way of the future. The way
of the future. The way of the future.

02:41:44.702 --> 02:41:47.558
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:41:47.662 --> 02:41:51.313
The way of the future. The way
of the future. The way of the future.

02:41:51.417 --> 02:41:53.896
The way of the future.
The way of the future. The way...

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:58.068
All right, stay here. I'll be right back.
Do you understand, Howard?

02:41:58.173 --> 02:42:00.012
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:42:00.116 --> 02:42:03.742
Guard the door. I'll get a doctor.
No one sees him like this.

02:42:03.846 --> 02:42:07.255
The way of the future. The way
of the future. The way of the future.

02:42:08.427 --> 02:42:11.834
The way of the future. The way
of the future. The way of the future.

02:42:11.939 --> 02:42:14.416
The way of the fut...

02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:17.968
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:42:24.109 --> 02:42:27.509
You are not safe.

02:42:34.745 --> 02:42:39.567
When I grow up, I'm gonna fly
the fastest planes ever built,

02:42:39.672 --> 02:42:42.325
make the biggest movies ever,

02:42:42.429 --> 02:42:45.455
and be the richest man in the world.

02:42:58.644 --> 02:43:01.007
The way of the future.

02:43:08.779 --> 02:43:11.025
The way of the future.

02:43:19.039 --> 02:43:21.024
The way of the future.

02:43:24.336 --> 02:43:26.248
The way of the future.

02:43:28.257 --> 02:43:30.161
The way of the future.

02:43:31.802 --> 02:43:33.545
The way of the future.
