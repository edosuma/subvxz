WEBVTT

04:02.700 --> 04:06.788
Thomas Zurbuchen is
the head of science at NASA,

04:06.871 --> 04:09.958
or Dr. Z, as we can also call you.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.209
The day has come.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.836
All these decades, all this time,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.964
all these people
working on this telescope,

04:16.047 --> 04:18.091
and here we are, minutes to launch.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.971
Ten, nine, eight…

05:15.523 --> 05:19.068
…three, two, one, liftoff!

06:45.780 --> 06:49.033
We have been given
the go-ahead to begin commanding

06:49.117 --> 06:51.953
a release of the forward latches.

06:53.955 --> 06:58.668
We're seeing both blankets
unfurl on the solar array.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.670
Looks good.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.679
I want to wish Hubble
its own set of adventures,

07:09.762 --> 07:12.932
that it may unlock
further mysteries of the universe.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.336
We want to look out
into the vastness of space

09:05.419 --> 09:09.215
and back to the beginnings of time
to answer the questions,

09:10.007 --> 09:13.469
"How did, and how do, galaxies form?"

09:14.554 --> 09:17.932
"Are there other habitable planets
outside our solar system?"

09:18.849 --> 09:21.602
"Is life unique to planet Earth?"

09:21.686 --> 09:26.065
Hubble and ground-based telescopes
have given us an important start.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.942
But we must go farther,

09:28.025 --> 09:30.403
and the Next Generation Space Telescope,

09:31.153 --> 09:35.491
NGST, will be the next great step taken.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.384
Navigation confirmed
that the parachute has deployed

10:35.468 --> 10:37.845
and we are seeing
significant deceleration.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.899
Oh, it's beautiful, Mike,
it really is.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.152
They've got the flag up now,
and you can see the stars and stripes.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.132
This institute will be managing
a telescope

22:22.215 --> 22:24.801
with a launch projected for 2007.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.847
The target price for doing this
will be 500 million dollars.

22:46.448 --> 22:50.619
Mr. Howard, did you ever see
the movie called The Money Pit?

22:51.745 --> 22:52.996
Yes, absolutely.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.125
I think the standard line in that movie
was, ''It's only two more weeks.''

22:57.209 --> 23:01.630
Mm-hmm. Now, how can we justify this
to our constituents?

28:20.573 --> 28:25.870
We are just about 12 hours from launching.
Fingers crossed that the weather holds,

28:25.954 --> 28:30.291
and we'll be able to launch
this telescope tomorrow morning.

28:30.375 --> 28:34.087
I can't believe… I can't believe
that we're almost here.

28:34.170 --> 28:37.132
I'm so excited. I can't wait
to get this telescope into space.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.303
Seven, six, five,

29:23.386 --> 29:27.849
four, three, two, one, liftoff.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.602
Ignition.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.317
Liftoff.

29:45.992 --> 29:49.788
All propulsion parameters
are normal. Trajectory is normal.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.353
The coolest thing
of the decade, possibly the century,

30:55.436 --> 30:56.563
is about to happen.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.314
The successor to the Hubble,

30:58.398 --> 31:01.109
three times as large
and way more technologically advanced,

31:01.192 --> 31:03.695
is about to be launched.
I'm going to start crying.

31:04.654 --> 31:08.741
Feliz Navidad. I got up
at 4:50 a.m. this morning

31:08.825 --> 31:10.785
to watch the JWST launch.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.873
Just praying to all the science gods
that everything goes without a hitch,

31:14.956 --> 31:17.792
and that in six months,
we'll be able to get this wonderful data.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.627
Merry Christmas, everyone.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.043
Ten, nine, eight…

33:40.518 --> 33:42.020
ESC shutdown.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.731
All onboard parameters are normal.

33:59.912 --> 34:01.956
Separation of the Webb Telescope.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.791
Go, Webb!

35:04.644 --> 35:06.938
Solar array is out.

35:07.021 --> 35:09.482
All right! All right!

35:15.530 --> 35:17.448
Now we're talking!

46:15.856 --> 46:20.486
JWST has completed
all of its major deployments.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.572
Things are going spectacular.

46:23.655 --> 46:26.784
We have the biggest,
most complex observatory

46:26.867 --> 46:30.579
we've ever sent to space,
and we can expect some awesome images.

46:31.330 --> 46:33.081
Y'all, we did it!

47:24.049 --> 47:26.885
An embarrassingly blurred
Hubble Telescope.

47:26.969 --> 47:30.514
One of the telescope's two mirrors
is thought to be defective,

47:30.597 --> 47:32.057
blurring its images.

47:55.163 --> 47:56.790
Jeff, you'll have your hands full.

47:56.874 --> 47:59.376
You might wanna go ahead
and put your helmet lights on.

48:00.335 --> 48:01.378
Good idea.

48:13.599 --> 48:15.434
-One bright pixel.
- Right there!

48:16.768 --> 48:18.061
There, there, there.

48:18.145 --> 48:20.480
- We can see the pixels.
-We did it!

49:50.862 --> 49:53.699
Six months after
the most powerful telescope ever made

49:53.782 --> 49:55.158
launched into space,

49:55.242 --> 49:58.870
the team inside the Webb Space Telescope's
flight control room is preparing

49:58.954 --> 50:01.498
to reveal what astronomers
all over the world

50:01.581 --> 50:04.167
have been waiting for for decades,

50:04.251 --> 50:06.878
the telescope's first full-color images.

51:59.157 --> 52:02.911
Today, our understanding
of the universe is about to get clearer.

52:02.994 --> 52:05.038
It is.
President Biden's going to unveil

52:05.122 --> 52:07.833
the much-anticipated
first full-color image

52:07.916 --> 52:10.127
from NASA's Webb Space Telescope.

54:06.868 --> 54:11.122
Today is a historic day
for America and all of humanity.

54:11.206 --> 54:12.374
We're gonna get a glimpse

54:12.457 --> 54:15.502
of the oldest documented light
in the history of the universe

54:15.585 --> 54:18.171
from over 13 billion--

54:18.255 --> 54:21.967
Let me say that again,
13 billion years ago.

54:22.050 --> 54:23.677
It's hard to even fathom.

54:23.760 --> 54:26.554
And now let's take a look
at the very first image

54:26.638 --> 54:28.682
from this miraculous telescope.

54:47.325 --> 54:48.910
Oh my gosh!

54:48.994 --> 54:51.579
The first image
from the James Webb Space Telescope.

54:51.663 --> 54:53.164
And here it is.

54:53.248 --> 54:56.334
Uh, galaxies to the edge of time.

54:56.418 --> 54:58.336
Oh my gosh.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.796
Okay…

55:09.306 --> 55:10.724
It really is amazing.

55:11.725 --> 55:13.184
Oh, my God.

55:17.355 --> 55:18.398
I have no words.

55:19.024 --> 55:21.735
The whole thing
is a bit mind-boggling, everybody.

55:21.818 --> 55:23.820
It's just-- It's just fantastic.

55:30.160 --> 55:32.829
It's a pretty cool photo.
It's just gorgeous.
