Hey, folks, welcome
to the Bobby Raines show.

00:22.420 --> 00:24.421
I am the aforementioned
Bobby Raines,

00:24.473 --> 00:25.756
as most of you know,

00:25.807 --> 00:28.893
just a note, if you're gonna
send me fan mail,

00:28.944 --> 00:30.895
don't put your name
on the front in crayon

00:30.946 --> 00:32.095
'cause I'm not opening it.

00:32.147 --> 00:33.514
That's all I need to do

00:33.582 --> 00:36.934
is find some rabbit pellets in
there, and I got hantavirus.

00:36.985 --> 00:37.852
Thank you.

00:39.387 --> 00:43.274
Five miles offshore today
on the Snark Ark

00:43.341 --> 00:44.992
'cause I'm not going onshore.

00:45.076 --> 00:46.193
I refuse to do it.

00:46.261 --> 00:47.862
I cannot go
into the city anymore.

00:47.929 --> 00:49.029
I'm sorry.

00:49.097 --> 00:52.249
The kids in that Occupy
movement driving me

00:52.300 --> 00:55.619
absolutely crazy when I go by.

00:55.670 --> 00:56.720

to break down

00:56.788 --> 00:58.055

Uncle Fester.

00:58.122 --> 01:00.341
You got the wide-eyed
stoner kid

01:00.425 --> 01:02.927
who's hitting the gecko bong
more frequently

01:02.978 --> 01:05.796
than one of Bob Marley's kids
at a Phish concert

01:05.847 --> 01:09.299
or else you have the disaffected
rich kid who's gonna show my dad

01:09.351 --> 01:12.319
that I'm not part
of the whole machine.

01:12.387 --> 01:13.771

01:13.822 --> 01:15.472
You walk in his shoes.

01:15.524 --> 01:17.208
I've just had enough.

01:17.275 --> 01:19.577
So what are you trying
to say, Bobby?

01:19.644 --> 01:21.328
it's over.

01:21.396 --> 01:23.330
It's time to Zamboni
off the loser ice

01:23.415 --> 01:25.916
and get these kids out of there.

01:25.984 --> 01:27.150

01:27.202 --> 01:30.237

you as squatters who apparently

01:33.708 --> 01:35.209
don't know squat, all right?

01:35.293 --> 01:37.327
We've had enough of it, kids.

01:37.379 --> 01:38.662

01:38.713 --> 01:40.731
Get back in the basement, okay?

01:40.799 --> 01:42.332

they always hit me

01:42.384 --> 01:43.968
with "Well, you don't have
any compassion

01:44.019 --> 01:44.969
for the common man."

01:45.020 --> 01:46.169
Wow, you kidding me?

01:46.221 --> 01:47.688
I want to help the helpless.

01:47.772 --> 01:51.108
I don't want to help
the clueless.

01:51.175 --> 01:53.744
And you have officially
lapsed over

01:53.812 --> 01:56.680

01:56.731 --> 01:57.898
Listen, you're looking
back on times

01:57.983 --> 01:59.349

01:59.401 --> 02:03.621

02:03.688 --> 02:04.855
All right, my man?

You are a rebel

04:39.903 --> 04:41.403

04:51.197 --> 04:52.398

04:52.465 --> 04:54.083
Yeah, man, Raines--
he was a comedic genius.

04:54.167 --> 04:56.034
He used to have a show
back in New York.

04:56.086 --> 04:57.870
I used to listen to it
all the time.

04:57.921 --> 04:59.371
I'm sorry, man.

04:59.422 --> 05:01.707
What do we know?

05:01.775 --> 05:04.075
All right, so S.I.S. is still
processing, but it's looking

05:04.127 --> 05:05.577
like some type
of an explosion.

05:05.645 --> 05:07.379
Like an equipment
malfunction?

05:07.430 --> 05:09.031
More like a bomb.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.435
What about his family?
They been notified?

05:13.503 --> 05:15.738
He's divorced.
He's got a daughter.

05:15.805 --> 05:17.473
Used to talk about her
all the time.

05:17.540 --> 05:19.308
Yeah, Chin's tracking
her down now.

05:19.392 --> 05:22.060
She definitely doesn't
need to see this, so please

05:22.112 --> 05:23.662
keep her away from here, okay?

05:23.730 --> 05:25.247
Yeah, yeah.

05:30.703 --> 05:32.404
This charge was directional.

05:32.455 --> 05:34.623
They used low explosive.

05:34.707 --> 05:37.543
It was not
a mass detonation device.

05:40.964 --> 05:42.113
This charge was meant

05:42.165 --> 05:44.750
to kill whoever was
sitting in front of it.

05:44.801 --> 05:46.919
A directional hit
would be consistent

05:46.970 --> 05:48.387
with the injuries.

05:48.454 --> 05:50.622
Our victim sustained
massive hemorrhaging

05:50.673 --> 05:53.091
and lacerations
to the chest cavity and head.

05:53.143 --> 05:55.527
He died instantly.

05:55.595 --> 05:58.096
Who was in this room, Max?

05:58.148 --> 06:00.799
His producer.

06:00.850 --> 06:02.568
He was hit by
the backblast, wasn't he?

06:02.635 --> 06:03.852
That is correct.

06:03.937 --> 06:05.154
But his injuries were minor

06:05.238 --> 06:08.306
due to the fact he was not
in the broadcast booth.

06:08.358 --> 06:09.808
We should go find him.

06:09.859 --> 06:11.743
You're extremely lucky
you weren't in that booth

06:11.811 --> 06:12.978
when that bomb went off.

06:13.029 --> 06:15.514
It came close.

06:15.582 --> 06:19.201
I was headed in there
on the next commercial.

06:19.269 --> 06:20.619
I can't believe Bobby's dead.

06:20.670 --> 06:23.154
I'm sorry, man.

06:23.206 --> 06:24.590
Listen, besides you,

06:24.657 --> 06:26.124
who else had access
to that soundboard?

06:26.176 --> 06:27.125
No one.

06:27.177 --> 06:29.461
We were a two-man
operation.

06:29.512 --> 06:31.830
I produced;
Bobby was the voice.

06:31.881 --> 06:35.234
Okay. Anybody else
you could think of

06:35.301 --> 06:36.518
have access to the yacht?

06:36.603 --> 06:38.336
Here when we're docked?

06:38.388 --> 06:41.106
Me, Bobby,
yacht club security.

06:41.173 --> 06:42.925
Nobody got in or out
without a keycard.

06:42.992 --> 06:44.843
Miles, can you think
of anybody

06:44.894 --> 06:46.428
who'd want to do something
like this?

06:46.496 --> 06:49.731
Look, Bobby completely rewrote
the rule book

06:49.816 --> 06:52.201
on what you could do in radio.

06:52.285 --> 06:54.770
And he'd speak his mind.
Some people didn't like it.

06:54.838 --> 06:56.855
I thought he came here
to retire.

06:56.906 --> 06:58.490
Yeah, he did,

06:58.541 --> 06:59.708
but a guy like Raines,

06:59.776 --> 07:01.944
he's only happy
when he's behind the mike.

07:02.011 --> 07:04.029
He had all the money
in the world,

07:04.080 --> 07:06.248
but he missed his acolytes.

07:06.332 --> 07:07.499
Acolytes?

07:07.550 --> 07:10.569
That's what he called his fans.

07:10.637 --> 07:12.004
Okay, so let me get
this straight.

07:12.055 --> 07:13.805
Bobby gets tired
of living the good life,

07:13.873 --> 07:16.675
he picks up the mike and starts
his show back up, right?

07:16.726 --> 07:18.760
Yeah. It was
a total pirate operation.

07:18.845 --> 07:23.599
Bobby-- he buys up the signal;
we air when we want to.

07:23.683 --> 07:25.267
And our ratings--
they were sky-high.

07:25.351 --> 07:27.452
I mean, we were smoking
the competition with static.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.638
With static?

07:29.706 --> 07:31.240
Yeah. He didn't keep
a regular schedule,

07:31.324 --> 07:33.325
so his die-hard fans--
they'd keep their dials tuned in

07:33.392 --> 07:35.027
to Raines' station
so they wouldn't miss him.

07:35.094 --> 07:37.195
It's gone! It's gone!
Wait.

07:37.247 --> 07:38.463
Breathe. What are you
talking about?

07:38.531 --> 07:40.365
Raines' body-- it's gone!

07:40.416 --> 07:42.334
What do you mean, it's gone?

07:42.401 --> 07:43.335
Somebody stole
my van

07:43.402 --> 07:44.586
with the body in it!

07:56.732 --> 07:58.965
Okay, first of all,
please slow down, okay?

07:58.967 --> 08:00.150
We don't even know
which way they went.

08:00.151 --> 08:03.487
This road is the only way
out of the marina.

08:03.555 --> 08:05.873
<i>Easy, please!</i>

08:05.924 --> 08:07.174

08:07.241 --> 08:08.842
Actually, this vehicle
<i>was</i> engineered

08:08.910 --> 08:10.076
to be driven in this manner.

08:10.128 --> 08:11.545
Would you stop it?
You're not helping!

08:11.596 --> 08:13.079
Commander, I am personally
responsible for that body,

08:13.131 --> 08:14.164
so hammer down if you will.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.301
Kono, this is not a good time.

08:17.385 --> 08:19.336
You're interrupting
vehicular manslaughter.

08:19.404 --> 08:21.421
You're chasing the morgue van,right?
How'd you know that?

08:21.489 --> 08:23.423
A couple of Raines' fans
took the body.

08:23.491 --> 08:26.092
They're live-tweeting everything, and
I'm tracking them through their phones.

08:26.144 --> 08:28.094
Okay, finally, the Internet
is good for something.

08:28.146 --> 08:29.730
Where are these idiots?

08:29.781 --> 08:30.914
Get over to Aloha Tower.

08:30.982 --> 08:32.164
You'll be able
to cut 'em off there.

08:40.958 --> 08:42.392
There it is!

08:50.935 --> 08:53.570
Hey, hands on the wheel!
On the wheel!

08:55.139 --> 08:56.757
Hey, you, you,
get out of the car.

08:56.808 --> 08:57.741
Hands behind your head.

08:59.911 --> 09:01.845
Interlock your fingers.
Hands behind your back.

09:01.913 --> 09:03.680
Interlock your fingers.
Against the hood.

09:03.765 --> 09:05.131
Against the hood here.

09:07.735 --> 09:09.903
The body's still here!
He's okay!

09:09.971 --> 09:11.355
You mean, aside
from the fact

09:11.439 --> 09:12.789
that he's dead,
right, Max?

09:18.312 --> 09:20.664
Okay, so let me get
this straight:

09:20.748 --> 09:22.749
you guys stole the body

09:22.817 --> 09:25.018
'cause you're big Bobby Raines
fans, is that right?

09:25.086 --> 09:26.954
Not fans.

09:27.005 --> 09:28.154
Acolytes, dude.

09:28.206 --> 09:30.107
"Dude"?

09:30.174 --> 09:32.109
Yeah.
Sir.

09:32.176 --> 09:34.928
So where exactly were you
planning on taking this body?

09:34.996 --> 09:37.347
We were gonna fly him
to the big island...

09:37.432 --> 09:39.016
...and toss him
in the Kilauea volcano.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.885
Wait a minute. You were gonna
fly him commercially?

09:41.970 --> 09:43.954
Kind of <i>Weekend</i>
<i>at Bernie's</i> style?

09:44.022 --> 09:46.172
Okay, well, that is
without question

09:46.224 --> 09:48.775
the stupidest thing I have
ever heard in my entire life.

09:48.843 --> 09:50.010
I second that.

09:50.061 --> 09:51.828
Get these guys out of here.

09:58.987 --> 10:00.337
<i>Tell me, Brandi.</i>

10:00.405 --> 10:04.524
Did your father get
any threats recently?

10:04.575 --> 10:06.626
No. I mean, there were always
the crazy acolytes,

10:06.694 --> 10:09.029
people who hated what he said,

10:09.080 --> 10:10.998
but we grew up like that.

10:11.049 --> 10:13.467
You get used to it.

10:13.534 --> 10:15.469
Could he have been worried
about something at work?

10:15.536 --> 10:17.871
He never talked about work
when we were together.

10:17.922 --> 10:21.892
How was his relationship
with his producer Miles Rogers?

10:21.976 --> 10:24.144
They were like brothers.

10:24.211 --> 10:25.712
Moved here
from New York together.

10:25.780 --> 10:27.431
All right.

10:27.515 --> 10:29.900
So no change in your father's
routine or behavior recently?

10:32.303 --> 10:34.504
Tell him about the gun.

10:34.572 --> 10:35.906
A gun?

10:35.990 --> 10:37.724
About a month ago

10:37.775 --> 10:39.843
my father took me with him
to buy a gun.

10:39.911 --> 10:41.495
Did he say
what he was worried about?

10:41.562 --> 10:44.247
No, I just remember
it being odd

10:44.332 --> 10:45.916
'cause my father was
anti-gun his whole life.

10:46.984 --> 10:49.069
He got one
for Brandi, too.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.488
He said he wanted me to be able
to protect myself.

10:51.556 --> 10:52.756
And he never said why?

10:56.127 --> 10:59.012
Do you think he knew
someone was trying to kill him?

10:59.080 --> 11:01.882
That's what
we're gonna find out.

11:07.271 --> 11:09.106
All right, good.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.690
See you back at the shop.

11:10.758 --> 11:11.975
All right, so get this.

11:12.060 --> 11:13.944
Turns out that Raines was
getting a little jumpy recently,

11:14.011 --> 11:15.145
was gearing up for bear,

11:15.229 --> 11:16.880
got himself a gun
and one for his daughter.

11:16.948 --> 11:18.782
Did Chin say
there was a threat?

11:18.866 --> 11:21.034
Uh, the daughter didn't know
of anything specific.

11:21.102 --> 11:23.120
So, what, he just runs out
and joins the NRA?

11:23.204 --> 11:27.707
Well, maybe he's just
a worried father looking out

11:27.775 --> 11:31.878
for his helpless, defenseless,
and very innocent little girl.

11:31.946 --> 11:34.815
Listen,
don't give me a look.

11:34.916 --> 11:36.633
Okay, I would be
very content knowing

11:36.701 --> 11:39.903
that Grace had a stun gun
in her back pocket at all times.

11:39.971 --> 11:41.505
There are very many
unsavory characters

11:41.589 --> 11:42.973
roaming around this rock.

11:43.057 --> 11:45.842
Why don't you tell me what
happened at the Hilton today?

11:45.927 --> 11:47.177
Nothing happened
at the Hilton.

11:47.261 --> 11:49.229
'Cause you seem upset to me.

11:49.296 --> 11:50.897
You became a shrink
all of a sudden?

11:50.965 --> 11:53.350
Yeah, and you can take
a seat in the back there,

11:53.434 --> 11:55.068
uh, if you'd be more
comfortable lying down.

11:55.136 --> 11:56.403
Or you can stay
where you're sitting

11:56.470 --> 11:57.971
and tell me what happened,
because either way,

11:58.022 --> 12:00.157
I'm gonna keep asking you,
so it's up to you.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.509
Okay, Sigmund, you want
to know what's bothering me?

12:02.577 --> 12:04.477
It's your hour.

12:04.529 --> 12:06.196
Okay, I'll tell you.

12:06.264 --> 12:07.447
Today by the pool,

12:07.498 --> 12:09.449
there was this very,
very creepy, creepy child.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.333
Okay.

12:10.418 --> 12:11.501
I mean, real, real malcontent.

12:11.586 --> 12:12.669
Mm-hmm.

12:12.753 --> 12:14.337
Okay, and-and you should
have seen Grace.

12:14.422 --> 12:16.039
I mean, she's giggling
like a schoolgirl

12:16.124 --> 12:17.757
every time
this kid opens his mouth.

12:17.825 --> 12:20.260
Uh, Grace <i>is</i> a schoolgirl.

12:20.327 --> 12:22.612
And this guy's
a stalker, okay?

12:22.680 --> 12:24.381
He's a stalker.
He fits the profile.

12:24.465 --> 12:26.450
Profile?
Called her five times in three days.

12:26.517 --> 12:28.468
How do you know that?
Because I dumped her phone.

12:28.519 --> 12:29.803
You dumped your
kid's phone?

12:29.854 --> 12:32.522
Yes.
And the stalker is... ten? Is he?

12:32.590 --> 12:33.773
What, ten years old?

12:33.841 --> 12:34.925
Ted Bundy was ten once.

12:34.992 --> 12:37.477
Yes, he was, Danny.

12:37.528 --> 12:39.529
Yes, he was.

12:43.100 --> 12:46.887
Fong took apart the soundboard.

12:46.954 --> 12:48.038
The wiring
for the IEDs

12:48.122 --> 12:49.873
was connected
to the sound effects button

12:49.957 --> 12:50.690
marked "Boom,"

12:50.741 --> 12:51.758
and they were hidden here

12:51.826 --> 12:53.359
and here in these two
speaker boxes.

12:53.411 --> 12:54.478
S.I.S. lifted

12:54.545 --> 12:56.480
some prints off the soundboard.
Most of them

12:56.547 --> 12:57.664
belonged to Raines
and his producer,

12:57.715 --> 12:58.665
but there were a couple
of foreign ones

12:58.716 --> 12:59.799
we ran through the system.

12:59.867 --> 13:01.051
All right, good.
We get any hits?

13:01.118 --> 13:03.053
Yeah. They came back
to Tony Archer, ex-NYPD

13:03.137 --> 13:04.871
Homicide.
Spent 30 years

13:04.922 --> 13:06.823
as the lead investigator,
90% conviction rate.

13:06.891 --> 13:08.708
According to the press
back in the day,

13:08.759 --> 13:10.877
he wrote the book
on interrogation techniques.

13:10.928 --> 13:12.662
What's he doing on our island?

13:12.730 --> 13:14.397
He retired to Oahu
four years ago.

13:14.482 --> 13:15.315
Six months after landing,

13:15.382 --> 13:16.816
he pulls a P.I. license.

13:16.884 --> 13:18.668
Check this out.

13:18.736 --> 13:21.988
Back when he was on the job,

13:22.056 --> 13:23.223
NYPD got hit

13:23.274 --> 13:24.991
by a corruption scandal.

13:25.059 --> 13:28.228
Wait a minute.
I remember this.

13:28.296 --> 13:29.746
Raines used to talk about this.

13:29.830 --> 13:30.997
He went hard

13:31.065 --> 13:32.398
at the NYPD
on the radio every morning.

13:32.450 --> 13:33.583
He was relentless.

13:33.668 --> 13:35.285
Were there ever charges
filed against Archer?

13:35.369 --> 13:36.686
No.

13:36.754 --> 13:39.739
He was clean, but the guys that
were dirty were friends of his.

13:39.790 --> 13:41.741
Well, maybe Archer was harboring
a grudge against Raines.

13:41.792 --> 13:43.693
He certainly had the know-how.
Says here

13:43.761 --> 13:45.378
he did a stint
on the bomb squad.

13:45.429 --> 13:47.097
We have an address on this guy?
No, but he has a slip

13:47.181 --> 13:50.567
registered in his name
at the South Shore Sailing Club.

14:18.279 --> 14:19.996
Hey.

14:20.064 --> 14:22.132
Don't move!
Who are you?

14:22.199 --> 14:24.000
Five-O.
Five what?

14:24.068 --> 14:25.168
Put your weapon down
right now.

14:25.236 --> 14:27.470
You're trespassing.
Put your weapon down!

14:27.555 --> 14:30.090
Maritime law says that I can
shoot your ass off right now.

14:30.141 --> 14:31.591
There is no such law.
What are you talking about?

14:31.642 --> 14:32.642
What if I blow it off anyway?

14:32.727 --> 14:33.810
How about you put
the gun down right now?

14:33.878 --> 14:35.161
Last time I'm gonna tell you.

14:35.229 --> 14:36.313
Listen, tough guy,

14:36.380 --> 14:38.665
I want a little I.D.
first, all right?

14:38.733 --> 14:40.233
My name is Commander
Steve McGarrett.

14:40.301 --> 14:43.937
The badge on my vest is
the only I.D. you're gonna get.

14:46.257 --> 14:47.357
I didn't bring my glasses,

14:47.441 --> 14:49.159
so you want to step
a little closer to me?

14:49.226 --> 14:50.944
Oh, yeah? Why don't
you come over here?

14:50.995 --> 14:52.245
I just finished saying that,
McGruff, didn't I?

14:52.313 --> 14:54.164
McGarrett.
Two "Rs," two "Ts."

14:54.231 --> 14:55.498
McGarrett.
Whatever.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.701
I hope you'll find it in
your heart to forgive me.

14:57.768 --> 15:00.337
Listen. Whoa.
Just listen.

15:00.421 --> 15:03.290
I see no reason for one
of us to get shot here.

15:03.341 --> 15:05.408
We don't have to do this.

15:05.476 --> 15:07.594
What we should do
is maybe, uh,

15:07.661 --> 15:10.647
put our little peashooters
down at the same time.

15:10.715 --> 15:12.716
Oh, yeah, how's that done?
Well, uh,

15:12.783 --> 15:14.050
you count-- one, two, three.

15:14.135 --> 15:15.869
On the count of three,
we put our guns down, huh?

15:15.936 --> 15:16.970
You got it.

15:17.021 --> 15:18.271
You want me to start?

15:18.339 --> 15:19.439
That would be nice.

15:19.506 --> 15:20.607
All right.
All right.

15:20.674 --> 15:21.992
One.

15:24.678 --> 15:26.696
You're doing good.
Keep going.

15:26.764 --> 15:28.264
Two.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.435
Three.

15:37.158 --> 15:39.659
Learned a big lesson,
didn't you, pal?

15:41.379 --> 15:44.530
Like you learned a big lesson,
too, old man, huh?

16:00.140 --> 16:01.974
Look, are these
bracelets necessary?

16:02.041 --> 16:04.056
I know you guys ran me.
You know I'm a cop.

16:04.057 --> 16:05.241
Oh, you're an ex-cop.

16:05.325 --> 16:06.433
So do me a favor.
Zip it.

16:06.434 --> 16:08.136
We found your prints
all over Raines' boat.

16:08.203 --> 16:09.603
Well, of course you did.

16:09.655 --> 16:11.739
You found plenty of 'em, too,
didn't you, Muscles?

16:11.790 --> 16:12.974
Muscles?

16:13.041 --> 16:14.208
That's nice.

16:14.276 --> 16:16.577
Uh, it's Detective
Danny Williams.

16:16.628 --> 16:19.797
The reason you found those
prints on the boat, Detective,

16:19.882 --> 16:22.750
is because Bobby
was my best pal.

16:22.801 --> 16:24.485
I mean, I'm his daughter's
godfather.

16:24.553 --> 16:26.838
I had a beer with him
at least once a week,

16:26.922 --> 16:28.639
every week on that boat.

16:28.724 --> 16:31.726
Oh, and speaking of the,
um, aforementioned,

16:31.793 --> 16:33.060
there's one sitting
over there.

16:33.128 --> 16:34.762
Would you mind
fetching that for me?

16:37.566 --> 16:38.766
You guys talk

16:38.817 --> 16:41.269
telepathically?
Because I don't hear an answer.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.321
Please.

16:56.151 --> 16:58.886
What the hell's your name again?

16:58.954 --> 17:00.822
<i>Still</i> Detective Danny Williams.

17:00.889 --> 17:05.076
Well, Danny,
you're a big hump, okay?

17:05.144 --> 17:06.260
A hump.
Okay.

17:06.328 --> 17:07.411
All right, listen.

17:07.479 --> 17:09.564
Let's go back.
How did you know Raines?

17:09.631 --> 17:10.830
From back in New York?

17:10.883 --> 17:12.550
Yeah. I did some work

17:12.617 --> 17:15.086
for him in New York, and I did
a little work for him here.

17:15.154 --> 17:16.971
So, what kind of work?

17:17.021 --> 17:18.439
Uh, work work.

17:18.506 --> 17:20.641
Like, uh... you know,
after you retire work.

17:20.692 --> 17:22.742
A little of this,
a little of that.

17:22.810 --> 17:24.478
Okay, pretend I'm an idiot.

17:24.530 --> 17:26.464
Okay.

17:28.700 --> 17:29.784
Uh,

17:29.851 --> 17:30.684
security.

17:30.736 --> 17:31.986
I did a little security work.

17:32.037 --> 17:34.855
I mean, Bobby was a...
a nut job magnet, right?

17:34.907 --> 17:36.123
So... security.

17:36.191 --> 17:37.992
Okay, I-I just...
I don't know if it's me.

17:38.043 --> 17:39.860
I find it to be
a very big coincidence

17:39.912 --> 17:41.379
that you used to work bomb squad

17:41.463 --> 17:44.599
and now this guy's dead,
and he was killed by a bomb.

17:44.666 --> 17:46.951
Coincidence?
Mm-hmm.

17:47.019 --> 17:48.169
You got me there, Hairdo.

17:48.220 --> 17:49.503
You got me there.

17:49.555 --> 17:51.038
So let me tell you the story.

17:51.089 --> 17:52.373
Here's how it goes.

17:52.441 --> 17:56.510
I moved out here pretending
I was going to retire,

17:56.562 --> 17:58.346
but because I was a good cop,

17:58.413 --> 18:01.382
I knew that this guy, too,
would move out here someday.

18:01.433 --> 18:04.685
So, one night,
I paddle out to his yacht,

18:04.736 --> 18:07.622
and, because I know how,
I plant

18:07.689 --> 18:09.223
this very sophisticated bomb.

18:09.274 --> 18:12.393
Then I leave my prints
all over the boat

18:12.444 --> 18:14.395
just to confuse you guys.

18:14.446 --> 18:16.497
I'm telling you,
this was a perfect crime.

18:16.564 --> 18:19.300
My luck I had to run
into you two Sherlocks.

18:19.368 --> 18:22.320
I mean, that is some amazing,
amazing police work.

18:22.387 --> 18:23.454
That was... that was great.

18:23.538 --> 18:24.538
That was very entertaining.

18:24.590 --> 18:25.706
He's wasting our time.

18:25.757 --> 18:26.824
Lock him up.

18:26.892 --> 18:29.243
Okay.

18:30.578 --> 18:31.712
What is that?

18:31.763 --> 18:33.648
What is what?
There it is again.

18:33.715 --> 18:36.250
What's the sound?
Well, I-I don't...

18:36.301 --> 18:37.751
I don't hear nothing.
There's a sound!

18:37.803 --> 18:39.770
Well, I mean,
it's a very old boat.

18:39.855 --> 18:41.672
It's creaky, probably.

18:41.740 --> 18:42.907
Watch him.

18:42.975 --> 18:44.542
Yeah, yeah.

18:46.928 --> 18:48.446
Danny.
Mmm.

18:48.530 --> 18:50.031
Nice.

19:01.493 --> 19:03.628
Danny, get him
over here.

19:09.935 --> 19:11.969
Sit down.

19:16.491 --> 19:18.793
You want to explain this?
Bait.

19:18.860 --> 19:20.127
No, try again.

19:20.178 --> 19:21.712
Guy's my suspect.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.197
Suspect? No, you
don't get a suspect.

19:23.265 --> 19:25.349
- What do you mean?
- He's crazy! Keep him away from me!

19:25.434 --> 19:26.367
Hey, you've been

19:26.435 --> 19:28.052
in a chum box, pal.
Nobody's going

19:28.120 --> 19:29.487
to go near you--
believe me.

19:29.571 --> 19:31.322
Stop talking.

19:31.406 --> 19:33.040
Who are you?

19:33.108 --> 19:34.358
Len Marks.

19:34.426 --> 19:36.360
I... did I just
say stop talking?

19:36.445 --> 19:37.528
I asked him.

19:37.612 --> 19:38.779
Who are you?

19:38.830 --> 19:39.980
Leonard Marks.

19:40.032 --> 19:41.866
I'm a security guard
at the yacht club.

19:41.950 --> 19:43.868
Yeah, now, tell my boys here

19:43.952 --> 19:45.652
why you didn't show up
for work last night,

19:45.704 --> 19:47.288
and why you
left your post

19:47.339 --> 19:49.623
and allowed someone to kill
my best friend. Tell them.

19:49.675 --> 19:51.208
Huh?

19:51.293 --> 19:52.960
I met a girl.

19:53.011 --> 19:54.661
You were supposed
to be on the job,

19:54.713 --> 19:56.347
you bum, you rent-a-cop
piece of garbage, you.

19:56.431 --> 19:57.932
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.800
You took off work
'cause you met a girl.

19:59.851 --> 20:02.503
I met her at the Slippah's Bar
the night before.

20:02.554 --> 20:04.505
Okay, so what'd you do?
You called in sick?

20:04.573 --> 20:06.474
No. He didn't even do that.
The guy just didn't show up.

20:06.525 --> 20:07.808
- That's what he did.
- All right.

20:07.859 --> 20:10.077
All right, all right.
When you did show up,

20:10.145 --> 20:12.096
did you notice anybody
hanging around Raines's yacht?

20:12.164 --> 20:13.931
Anybody scouting it
out, acting weird?

20:13.999 --> 20:15.266
Anything?
Yeah.

20:15.334 --> 20:17.535
His acolytes were always trying
to get a piece of him--

20:17.602 --> 20:19.003
photos, autographs, anything.

20:20.906 --> 20:22.289
That's it.
Now we're talking, buddy.

20:22.357 --> 20:23.641
Whoa.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.943
What? What
are you doing?

20:26.011 --> 20:27.244
What the hell
are you doing, man?

20:27.329 --> 20:28.979
Get out of here.
The guy's a suspect.

20:29.047 --> 20:30.631
He's supposed to be
in jail. Hey.

20:30.698 --> 20:31.916
Get... get off...
Would you stop?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.001
The guy belongs in jail, all right?
Okay. All right.

20:34.052 --> 20:36.053
So we'll save him a place
right next to you--

20:36.138 --> 20:37.704
the bunk right
on top, okay?

20:40.058 --> 20:41.976
Can I ask you a question?

20:42.043 --> 20:43.978
Yeah, go ahead.
You got shoes?

20:44.045 --> 20:46.180
I'm in Hawaii. What the hell
do I need shoes for?

20:46.231 --> 20:48.099
You're going to jail. You got
to have shoes to go to jail.

20:48.183 --> 20:50.317
Oh, so now you're concerned
about my health and hygiene?

20:50.385 --> 20:52.153
That's very nice.
That's very sweet.

20:52.220 --> 20:53.521
You want to fetch them?

20:53.572 --> 20:54.855
They're right over there.

20:54.906 --> 20:56.907
Fetch.

21:01.046 --> 21:02.863
You ready?
Yeah.

21:02.914 --> 21:05.282
Let's go.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.718
This is frigging
stupid!

21:09.704 --> 21:10.671
Hey, Max.

21:10.738 --> 21:12.206
So you said you have something.

21:12.257 --> 21:13.407
Yes.

21:13.458 --> 21:15.526
During my examination,
I used a sticky disc

21:15.594 --> 21:17.545
and an X-ray
fluorescence detector

21:17.596 --> 21:19.130
to scan the body
for trace.

21:19.197 --> 21:21.499
I found potassium
nitrate, carbon,

21:21.566 --> 21:23.250
sulfur, barium,
and copper

21:23.301 --> 21:25.186
both in the wounds
and on the torso.

21:26.221 --> 21:28.506
So is that
good or bad?

21:28.573 --> 21:31.008
It's perplexing.
How so?

21:31.076 --> 21:33.811
Well, the first three
components make gunpowder,

21:33.895 --> 21:35.479
common in bomb victims.

21:35.564 --> 21:37.231
However, the latter two
are utilized

21:37.282 --> 21:38.833
to create the colors
green and blue,

21:38.900 --> 21:40.117
respectively.

21:40.185 --> 21:41.569
Colors. Okay.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.338
You've lost me, Max.

21:44.406 --> 21:49.026
I found thin paper
inside Raines' wounds.

21:49.094 --> 21:51.111
I sent it over to the lab
for analysis,

21:51.163 --> 21:53.681
and they determined
it was nosing paper.

21:53.748 --> 21:55.749
Oh, like the kind you use
to make firecrackers?

21:55.801 --> 21:57.301
Well, not exactly.

21:57.385 --> 22:00.171
The bomb used to kill
your victim was manufactured

22:00.255 --> 22:02.756
using repurposed
commercial-grade fireworks,

22:02.808 --> 22:04.675
the kind you would
typically find in a July Fourth

22:04.759 --> 22:06.010
or Chinese New Year's
celebration.

22:06.094 --> 22:08.295
I imagine it was
a rather crude weapon.

22:08.346 --> 22:10.898
But very effective.

22:10.965 --> 22:13.717
<i>Chin and Kono have got</i>

22:13.785 --> 22:15.769
a list of importers
and permit holders

22:15.821 --> 22:17.521
for professional-
grade fireworks.

22:17.606 --> 22:19.139
Okay, I got them
chasing them down now.

22:19.191 --> 22:20.241
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait.

22:20.308 --> 22:22.326
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it. Hold it.

22:22.410 --> 22:25.279
J-Just let me get this
straight here, Magoo.

22:25.330 --> 22:28.115
You now have your
crack task force team

22:28.166 --> 22:32.670
running around, asking guys if
they illegally sold fireworks

22:32.754 --> 22:35.155
to some wacko that wants
to blow up Raines?

22:35.207 --> 22:36.156
That's good

22:36.208 --> 22:38.375
because I literally
can see them

22:38.460 --> 22:39.793
lining up
to confess down there.

22:39.845 --> 22:42.179
And I bow to your prowess
as a detective.

22:42.264 --> 22:43.864
Please, shut up. All right?

22:43.932 --> 22:46.867
What we do after we drop
your sorry ass off in jail

22:46.935 --> 22:48.719
is our business, you understand?

22:48.803 --> 22:51.372
Listen, just, please,
Dick Tracy, stop.

22:51.439 --> 22:53.107
Because you and I both know

22:53.174 --> 22:54.675
this is a complete
waste of time.

22:54.726 --> 22:55.676
You know it.

22:55.727 --> 22:57.478
Got a better idea?
Yes.

22:57.529 --> 22:58.729
Yes, I have.

22:58.797 --> 23:00.948
I always have a better idea.

23:01.015 --> 23:02.349
Give me the phone.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.951
Why?

23:04.018 --> 23:05.536
I want to schedule
a pedicure.

23:05.620 --> 23:07.121
I know a guy.
Give me the phone.

23:07.188 --> 23:08.855
Oh, well, he knows a guy.
That's very promising.

23:08.907 --> 23:09.856
Give me the phone.

23:09.908 --> 23:11.525
There you go.

23:12.844 --> 23:15.028
Hey, yo!

23:15.080 --> 23:16.947
Hold on a minute.
This is your guy?

23:17.015 --> 23:18.165
That's my guy.

23:18.216 --> 23:19.166
That's our guy.

23:19.217 --> 23:20.534
Easy, gentlemen.

23:20.585 --> 23:22.119
Plenty of me to go around.

23:22.187 --> 23:24.505
Hey.
What's up, T?

23:24.556 --> 23:25.706
What's up with
the jewelry?

23:25.757 --> 23:27.341
They run you down
for the cash you owe me

23:27.392 --> 23:29.126
on the card game
last week?

23:29.194 --> 23:30.261
Cash? Cards?

23:30.328 --> 23:31.829
What are you talking about, man?

23:31.897 --> 23:33.180
You know there's no gambling
on this island.

23:33.231 --> 23:34.965
It's illegal, right, officers?

23:35.033 --> 23:37.501
So how can I be
of service

23:37.569 --> 23:38.736
to my community?
Well, I'll tell you.

23:38.820 --> 23:40.688
Okay, you remember that big
mortar firework you got me

23:40.739 --> 23:42.223
for New Year's Eve
a couple years ago?

23:42.290 --> 23:43.741
Of course I do.

23:43.825 --> 23:46.810
HPD wasn't too happy when you
launched it off of Magic Island.

23:46.878 --> 23:48.312
Oh, true that.

23:48.380 --> 23:50.030
Well, um, we need to know

23:50.081 --> 23:51.198
where you bought it.

23:51.249 --> 23:53.000
At the fireworks store,
where else?

23:53.067 --> 23:55.286
It's the only place they sell
that heavy-duty stuff.

23:55.370 --> 23:57.354
Oh, good. You can take
us there, right?

23:59.407 --> 24:00.708
Can, can.

24:00.759 --> 24:02.576
But I ain't walking in there.

24:02.627 --> 24:04.795
That'll damage my future
firework-acquiring skills.

24:06.298 --> 24:07.848
All right.

24:07.915 --> 24:09.550
It's two blocks down.
Let's roll.

24:09.618 --> 24:10.601
All right, come on.
Okay.

24:10.669 --> 24:11.769
Hold it.

24:11.836 --> 24:13.804
Listen, since we're trying
to work together,

24:13.872 --> 24:15.856
maybe you could consider
taking these things off.

24:15.923 --> 24:17.257
Maybe you can consider
putting your shoes on.

24:17.309 --> 24:18.826
Don't need shoes.

24:18.893 --> 24:20.277
Stop. Don't enable him.

24:21.112 --> 24:23.447
I want to help you, gentlemen,

24:23.515 --> 24:27.001
but I'm just
the humble owner of a tiny

24:27.068 --> 24:28.235
produce market.

24:28.286 --> 24:30.220
Just, uh, produce, huh?

24:31.673 --> 24:33.273
Look at that.
Whoa!

24:33.325 --> 24:34.325
Okay, oh, what
do we got?

24:34.409 --> 24:35.726
What do we got here?

24:35.794 --> 24:36.744
- Wow.
- Yeah.

24:36.795 --> 24:38.062
These kind
of look like

24:38.129 --> 24:39.430
fireworks to me.

24:40.632 --> 24:42.132
Let me tell you something
about this, okay?

24:42.217 --> 24:43.434
I don't care about this.

24:44.636 --> 24:45.753
I want the aerial mortars.

24:45.804 --> 24:48.288
The large aerial mortars,

24:48.340 --> 24:49.974
you understand me?
Sell any of those?

24:51.676 --> 24:54.345
Look, I sell mortars
for New Year's.

24:54.429 --> 24:56.747
This guy comes in,
he wants big ones.

24:56.815 --> 24:58.315
I had to call China
for that.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.984
Okay, what's
this guy's name?

25:00.068 --> 25:01.819
I didn't ask.

25:01.903 --> 25:02.969
What'd he look like?

25:03.021 --> 25:04.655
Haole.

25:04.723 --> 25:06.073
Dark hair.

25:06.141 --> 25:07.491
About your height.

25:07.559 --> 25:09.142
That's all I remember.

25:09.194 --> 25:10.778
Okay, book him, Muscles.

25:11.913 --> 25:13.497
I like this guy.

25:13.565 --> 25:14.498
Come on. Turn around.

25:14.582 --> 25:16.149
No, no, wait, wait.

25:16.201 --> 25:18.485
I remember a truck.

25:18.536 --> 25:21.988
I brought the fireworks to
a farm truck, and he drove away.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.507
Wait, farm truck?

25:23.591 --> 25:25.259
Y-You sure about the farm truck?

25:25.326 --> 25:26.844
Yeah. I only remember

25:26.928 --> 25:30.347
because it had a big picture
of a lettuce on it.

25:32.550 --> 25:33.651
What?

25:36.488 --> 25:38.822
Um, we, uh, we got to go
back to the boat.

25:38.890 --> 25:40.891
Come on. We got to go back.
Back to the boat?

25:42.927 --> 25:45.663
<i>Okay, so what are</i>
<i>we doing here?</i>

25:47.065 --> 25:50.484
Bobby had this pet charity, uh,

25:50.535 --> 25:51.785
Hale Ku'oko'a--

25:51.853 --> 25:53.637
House of Freedom--
for runaway kids.

25:53.705 --> 25:55.205
Hold on a second.

25:55.290 --> 25:56.323
I heard about
the charity.

25:56.374 --> 25:58.325
They put the kids up
and give them legal help

25:58.376 --> 26:00.961
to emancipate themselves, right?
That's right.

26:01.028 --> 26:03.047
Raines was involved in that?
Oh, yeah, big-time.

26:03.131 --> 26:04.798
Why? What's so special
about this charity?

26:04.866 --> 26:08.702
I guess when Bobby was a kid,
his dad was

26:08.753 --> 26:09.920
a piece of work.

26:10.004 --> 26:11.538
Used to knock him
around with

26:11.589 --> 26:13.257
whatever the hell
he had in his hand.

26:13.341 --> 26:14.708
And, uh, well, anyway,
it was bad.

26:14.759 --> 26:15.993
So, one day,
he ran away,

26:16.061 --> 26:17.961
never looked back.
Made something of himself.

26:18.029 --> 26:21.782
And, uh, I guess he wants
to get back to the kids.

26:23.184 --> 26:24.985
It's here...
Here you go.

26:25.052 --> 26:26.570
Here you go.
Here you go.

26:26.654 --> 26:27.938
There's your head of lettuce
right there.

26:28.022 --> 26:29.006
Let me see that.

26:32.077 --> 26:33.026
Why'd you take
this picture anyway?

26:33.078 --> 26:35.863
Uh, I guess somebody's parents,

26:35.914 --> 26:37.414
they thought that Raines
was, you know,

26:37.499 --> 26:39.566
getting in the middle of
some of their family business.

26:39.617 --> 26:40.734
They didn't like it.

26:40.785 --> 26:44.037
So they got together
and they wanted to protest.

26:44.089 --> 26:45.339
Me, I wanted to take pictures,

26:45.406 --> 26:47.407
just in case, you know,
they crossed that line again.

26:47.459 --> 26:49.793
What are you talking about?

26:49.878 --> 26:52.913
Well, some of these
runaway charities--

26:52.964 --> 26:54.598
they've been vandalized.

26:54.682 --> 26:56.166
Just, you know, property damage

26:56.234 --> 26:58.001
kind of crap.
Well, right,

26:58.069 --> 26:59.586
until now.

26:59.637 --> 27:01.421
Is that why Raines
bought the gun?

27:01.473 --> 27:02.422
No.

27:02.474 --> 27:04.942
That would be me.

27:05.009 --> 27:07.010
I told him
he should be strapped,

27:07.078 --> 27:08.362
in case something happened.

27:08.429 --> 27:10.697
Guess it did him
a lot of good, right?

27:10.765 --> 27:11.815
Come on,
you didn't know

27:11.900 --> 27:12.866
that these whack jobs
were gonna go out

27:12.934 --> 27:14.701
and make bombs
out of fireworks.

27:14.769 --> 27:16.570
- Yeah, yeah.
- Look, all right.

27:16.621 --> 27:19.940
Let's put a name to this face
and find our killer.

27:25.641 --> 27:26.541
Doug Leland.

27:26.542 --> 27:28.683
Tax records show
that he works at Taka's Farm

27:28.685 --> 27:30.915
on the North Shore,
but when we reached out to them,

27:30.920 --> 27:32.871
they said he hadn't
been there in days.

27:32.922 --> 27:34.990
Is something wrong?

27:35.058 --> 27:37.292
Uh, this is a computer.

27:37.377 --> 27:39.878
Wow, that's pretty good,
Detective.

27:39.929 --> 27:42.080
I'm Kono, by the way.

27:42.132 --> 27:43.715
Uh, Anthony.

27:43.766 --> 27:45.667
Pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure.

27:45.735 --> 27:47.336
I hope to enhance that feeling
as time goes on.

27:49.389 --> 27:50.489
All right,

27:50.557 --> 27:51.923
do we know where Leland lives?

27:51.975 --> 27:53.091
Uh, yeah.

27:53.143 --> 27:54.593
We got a home address,
but it's bogus.

27:54.644 --> 27:55.760
It's not even a
residential building.

27:55.812 --> 27:57.346
See, uh...

27:57.413 --> 27:59.598
I don't know.

27:59.649 --> 28:01.834
What don't you know?
What are you thinking?

28:01.901 --> 28:03.652
I'm thinking that this guy
didn't do it.

28:03.736 --> 28:04.769
Is that right?

28:04.821 --> 28:05.770
Yeah, that's right.

28:05.822 --> 28:07.156
Care to elaborate?

28:07.223 --> 28:10.275
Yeah, um... Leland's a coward.

28:10.326 --> 28:11.777
See, when HPD
rolled up,

28:11.845 --> 28:13.245
the protestors he was with,

28:13.313 --> 28:16.231
they all linked arms
and sat down.

28:16.299 --> 28:17.716
But not this guy; he just ran.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.585
Yeah, he ran because he had
something to hide. Makes sense.

28:19.636 --> 28:23.589
Well, you see a suspect,
I see a coward.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.691
This afternoon, you couldn't see
anything without your glasses.

28:25.758 --> 28:27.593
Hey, check this out.

28:27.644 --> 28:28.594
According to this,

28:28.645 --> 28:29.578
Leland worked demolitions

28:29.646 --> 28:31.113
for five years

28:31.181 --> 28:34.066
at a mine in Colorado.
That means he knew explosives.

28:34.133 --> 28:36.518
Do you still think
that he didn't do it?

28:36.586 --> 28:37.870
I'm-I'm just saying,

28:37.937 --> 28:39.271
there's something about it
don't feel right.

28:39.322 --> 28:41.607
But he has motive;
he has means,

28:41.658 --> 28:44.109
which means he's a suspect,
so we will check him out.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.545
In the meantime, what do we
got on his known associates?

28:46.613 --> 28:48.614
Well, HPD has
Field Interview Cards

28:48.665 --> 28:50.465
on the protestors
associated with Leland,

28:50.533 --> 28:53.151
and most of them
live or work off-island;

28:53.203 --> 28:55.420
couple of them are in jail,
except one:

28:55.488 --> 28:57.022
Karen Whitfield.

28:57.090 --> 28:59.958
Let's go talk to her,
see what she knows.

29:00.026 --> 29:02.678
What do I do with him?

29:02.745 --> 29:04.213
Tony.
Hmm?

29:04.280 --> 29:06.615
It's been a pleasure, and
you're free to go, all right?

29:06.683 --> 29:08.333
Go? Go?
W-Where am I going?

29:08.384 --> 29:10.669
What, am I gonna go
to the beach, have a mai tai?

29:10.720 --> 29:11.937
There's some guy
running around there

29:12.004 --> 29:13.272
that killed a friend of mine.

29:13.339 --> 29:15.140
I don't think so, pal.
I don't think so.

29:15.191 --> 29:17.025
You got no choice.
Look, you don't know me.

29:17.110 --> 29:18.277
I don't know you.

29:18.344 --> 29:19.478
But I knew Bobby.

29:19.529 --> 29:20.562
And I owe him.

29:20.630 --> 29:22.564
I owe more than one.

29:22.649 --> 29:25.284
So I'm asking you, please,

29:25.351 --> 29:27.352
please let me help you
with this one.

29:35.878 --> 29:38.480
<i>Doug told me he was</i>
<i>losing his son due to</i>

29:38.548 --> 29:41.116
the emancipation program
Raines supported.

29:41.184 --> 29:42.684
Uh, the Hale Ku'oko'a House?

29:42.752 --> 29:44.052
That's right.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.587
And I didn't think
it was right.

29:45.672 --> 29:48.056
Some radio guy getting in
the middle of family problems?

29:48.124 --> 29:50.409
Doug was trying to work things
out with his son.

29:50.476 --> 29:51.710
Want to sit?

29:51.761 --> 29:53.262
Okay.

29:57.550 --> 29:58.900
No, no, thanks.

29:58.985 --> 29:59.985
I'll stand.

30:00.052 --> 30:03.221
I got, uh, two new knees
a couple years ago--

30:03.273 --> 30:04.556
warranty expired.

30:06.509 --> 30:07.609
So how do you know Leland?

30:07.677 --> 30:10.195
I met him
at one of the protests.

30:10.246 --> 30:11.396
Do you have children?

30:14.617 --> 30:18.353
When I was 12 years old,
I broke my arm.

30:18.421 --> 30:21.256
And that was right after
I'd just gotten stitches

30:21.341 --> 30:22.824
after falling off my bike.

30:24.927 --> 30:28.513
One of my teachers thought
I was being abused by my father

30:28.581 --> 30:31.283
and tried to put
me in a home.

30:31.351 --> 30:33.251
And when I tried
to tell them the truth,

30:33.303 --> 30:36.421
they just thought
I was scared and lying.

30:38.441 --> 30:41.560
It took two years for everything
to get back to normal.

30:41.611 --> 30:45.280
But if I had been taken away,

30:45.365 --> 30:48.000
my life and my father's
would have been ruined.

30:49.952 --> 30:53.772
So, when I heard Leland's story,
I wanted to do something.

30:53.823 --> 30:56.274
And because I'm a paralegal,
I was able to help

30:56.326 --> 30:57.993
with some forms to fight
the emancipation.

30:58.061 --> 30:59.878
But...

31:01.881 --> 31:05.317
But, um...
that never happened, did it?

31:05.385 --> 31:07.586
No.

31:07.637 --> 31:09.588
So you just stopped
helping him.

31:09.639 --> 31:12.174
Just stopped. Why?

31:17.296 --> 31:19.297
Look, Karen, um...

31:19.349 --> 31:21.350
I lost a very...

31:23.353 --> 31:25.520
very, very dear friend of mine;
he got murdered.

31:25.605 --> 31:27.823
And, uh,

31:27.907 --> 31:29.708
I just think
Leland might know something.

31:33.913 --> 31:37.866
I was with Doug one day,
and I saw...

31:37.950 --> 31:39.701
I don't know,
these-these devices

31:39.769 --> 31:41.420
with wires coming
out of them.

31:41.487 --> 31:43.622
These diagrams

31:43.673 --> 31:46.375
and these pictures
of someone's house and boat.

31:46.442 --> 31:47.759
It...

31:47.827 --> 31:50.262
I'm so stupid.

31:50.329 --> 31:52.097
I should have just...

31:52.164 --> 31:53.164
It's okay.

31:56.519 --> 31:58.520
Um, did you ask him about it?

31:58.604 --> 32:00.839
I got scared.

32:00.890 --> 32:02.858
I just left.

32:02.925 --> 32:04.976
We never talked
after that.

32:05.027 --> 32:06.311
And where did you see this?

32:07.447 --> 32:08.980
In his R.V.

32:09.031 --> 32:10.348
Where is that?

32:10.416 --> 32:13.184
He had it parked
near Manoa Falls.

32:13.236 --> 32:14.636
But that was a couple weeks ago.

32:17.490 --> 32:18.473
Um...

32:19.692 --> 32:23.445
Karen, um...

32:23.513 --> 32:27.382
do you think that Doug
is capable of murder?

32:30.887 --> 32:35.390
Doug blamed Raines
for breaking up his family.

32:35.475 --> 32:38.343
He was angry and he talked
about sending Raines a message,

32:38.394 --> 32:40.946
so...

32:41.013 --> 32:43.932
yes.

32:44.016 --> 32:46.418
I think he killed him.

32:52.408 --> 32:54.743
♪ ♪

33:17.383 --> 33:19.367
Leland!

33:20.236 --> 33:22.838
Move it!

33:22.905 --> 33:25.089
On the couch!

33:26.893 --> 33:27.776
Clear.

33:29.729 --> 33:31.513
Let's go.

33:31.581 --> 33:34.265
You're lying!

33:34.317 --> 33:36.651
We found the exact same
type of bomb materials

33:36.736 --> 33:38.987
in your R.V. that was used
to kill Raines.

33:39.055 --> 33:41.056
What can I say?
It's a coincidence.

33:42.274 --> 33:44.025
Bomb-making a hobby of yours?

33:44.093 --> 33:46.277
Yeah, I like to work
with my hands.

33:46.329 --> 33:48.112
You think this is a joke?

33:50.449 --> 33:52.417
Raines financed your
son's emancipation

33:52.468 --> 33:54.536
and you wanted him dead for it.

33:54.604 --> 33:57.055
I wanted him dead.
That's right.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.390
But I didn't kill him.

33:59.425 --> 34:01.059
I don't believe you.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.928
Those bombs were just
meant to scare him.

34:02.979 --> 34:06.565
I wanted to blow that whole damn
runaway home into the sky.

34:06.632 --> 34:08.632
But...

34:09.467 --> 34:11.302
But what?

34:11.353 --> 34:12.904
I don't know...

34:12.972 --> 34:14.589
All right?
I just couldn't do it.

34:16.359 --> 34:17.692
Where were you two days ago?

34:17.777 --> 34:19.527
I drove my R.V.
up to Manoa.

34:19.612 --> 34:21.079
Anybody who can vouch for that?

34:21.146 --> 34:22.563
No.

34:22.632 --> 34:24.032
I went up there alone.

34:24.116 --> 34:25.283
Wait. You drove your R.V.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.118
up to Manoa
a couple days ago?

34:27.168 --> 34:28.203
That's right.

34:28.286 --> 34:29.487
And before then?

34:30.456 --> 34:32.456
I'd never been there before.

34:32.507 --> 34:34.492
<i>Leland's friend Karen told me</i>

34:34.543 --> 34:36.561
the R.V. was parked
in Manoa Falls weeks ago.

34:36.629 --> 34:39.380
Now Leland's saying he's never
been there before two days ago.

34:39.465 --> 34:40.549
One of them's lying.

34:40.616 --> 34:42.434
Yeah. Or both.
I'll go tell McGarrett.

34:53.896 --> 34:55.897
Karen Whitfield?

34:57.283 --> 34:59.284
Five-O!

35:04.373 --> 35:06.374
Karen?

35:08.494 --> 35:10.495
Karen.

35:12.898 --> 35:14.583
Her body's still warm.

35:22.441 --> 35:24.208
Hey, hey, hey!
Drop the gun!

35:34.558 --> 35:36.526
Don't be ridiculous.

35:36.593 --> 35:38.600
When I got here she was dead
already, and she was still warm.

35:38.601 --> 35:40.552
So naturally,
I searched the perimeter,

35:40.620 --> 35:42.087
looking for the killer.

35:42.138 --> 35:44.189
What is he doing here?

35:44.257 --> 35:45.424
I am following the evidence.

35:45.475 --> 35:47.559
What evidence?
Come here.

35:49.679 --> 35:50.929
See this?

35:52.148 --> 35:53.432
Slippah's Bar.

35:53.483 --> 35:55.917
Okay. So what does that
have to do with the murder?

35:55.985 --> 35:58.720
Well, Slippahs Bar's
this joint that my suspect--

35:58.788 --> 36:00.138
that, uh, security guard--

36:00.189 --> 36:03.108
he was there that night
that the bomb was planted.

36:03.159 --> 36:04.476
Okay, I understand,

36:04.527 --> 36:05.727
but I'm sure there were
plenty of girls there.

36:05.795 --> 36:06.828
That's very true.

36:06.913 --> 36:08.730
But when I showed him
her picture,

36:08.798 --> 36:11.199
he I.D.'d her as the girl
he went home with.

36:11.284 --> 36:13.985
All right. So she picks him up;
she steals his keycard;

36:14.037 --> 36:15.237
she gets access to the yacht.

36:15.304 --> 36:16.788
Where she plants
one of the bombs

36:16.839 --> 36:19.624
she stole off of Leland
after she "befriended" him.

36:19.676 --> 36:20.959
Homegirl's quite the operator.

36:21.010 --> 36:22.660
Nice.

36:23.513 --> 36:25.797
Gold stars all around here.

36:25.848 --> 36:27.832
Okay.
So-So Karen blew up Raines.

36:27.884 --> 36:30.668
Uh, makes sense, but it still
does not explain motive.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.170
And it still does not explain

36:32.238 --> 36:34.005
who killed her.

36:36.025 --> 36:38.560
So, it turns out that
Karen Whitfield's an alias.

36:38.644 --> 36:39.928
Her real name
is Susan Dupree.

36:39.996 --> 36:41.613
She has outstanding warrants
in Arizona and California

36:41.680 --> 36:43.265
for sweetheart scams...

36:43.332 --> 36:45.850
targeted the wealthy
"lonely seeking love" set.

36:45.902 --> 36:47.736
And she also had a male partner.

36:47.820 --> 36:49.037
That's an old school scam
right there.

36:49.122 --> 36:50.906
Okay, well, Raines was single.

36:50.990 --> 36:54.326
Maybe he was one of their marks
and things did not go so good.

36:54.377 --> 36:56.294
No, no, no, no.
If-If he had a girl,

36:56.362 --> 36:58.246
I think I'd have known about it.

36:58.331 --> 37:00.048
There's no way.

37:00.133 --> 37:01.866
We need answers.
We need the partner.

37:01.918 --> 37:03.701
Okay, what do we got
on the partner? What do we know?

37:03.753 --> 37:06.037
Not much.
White male, early 20s.

37:06.089 --> 37:08.223
No real I.D.
or composites,

37:08.307 --> 37:09.558
but according
to the crime report

37:09.642 --> 37:10.892
they made off
with close to a million dollars

37:10.960 --> 37:11.927
before
they disappeared.

37:12.011 --> 37:13.311
Yeah, well, close
to a million dollars

37:13.379 --> 37:14.379
wasn't enough
for these two.

37:14.430 --> 37:16.598
They came here
to pull another scam.

37:16.682 --> 37:18.483
Tell me, when did
she get to Oahu?

37:20.703 --> 37:22.637
I got the credit card
statements.

37:22.705 --> 37:26.458
She bought a ticket from Phoenix
to Oahu last summer, June 12.

37:26.526 --> 37:28.844
Okay, give me phone records
from the day she landed, Kono.

37:30.396 --> 37:32.030
All right, got some
outgoing 808s...

37:32.081 --> 37:33.081
Give me names.

37:40.923 --> 37:42.290
Whoa, what is it?

37:42.375 --> 37:44.042
It's Todd Dutton.

37:44.093 --> 37:45.327
That's Brandi's husband.

37:45.394 --> 37:47.362
Yeah. And Karen's partner.

37:52.385 --> 37:53.918
Why?

37:53.970 --> 37:56.421
Now tell me why.

37:56.472 --> 37:58.089
You talk to me,
you son of a bitch,

37:58.141 --> 37:59.257
or I will kill you right here.

37:59.308 --> 38:01.309
I don't care
who's watching.

38:03.112 --> 38:04.980
Look, it's not
what you think, okay?

38:05.064 --> 38:06.764
I-I would never hurt Brandi.

38:06.816 --> 38:07.765
What?

38:07.817 --> 38:09.601
What'd you say?

38:09.652 --> 38:11.269
You wanted her money.

38:11.320 --> 38:14.105
So you and Karen--
you had Bobby Raines killed

38:14.157 --> 38:17.342
because you knew that your wife
stood to inherit Bobby's millions.

38:17.410 --> 38:19.444
No, no... I didn't have anything
to do with that.

38:19.495 --> 38:21.163
That was all Karen's idea.
Why?

38:21.247 --> 38:22.614
She was tired of waiting.

38:22.665 --> 38:23.882
Waiting?

38:23.949 --> 38:25.217
Waiting, but that's-that's
the grift, right?

38:25.284 --> 38:26.218
Isn't that the plan?

38:26.285 --> 38:28.286
You wait?

38:28.337 --> 38:30.672
The plan was
for me to marry Brandi

38:30.756 --> 38:34.359
and to-to skim off of her trust.

38:34.427 --> 38:37.095
But this time it was...
it was different.

38:37.146 --> 38:40.549
Different how?
How different?

38:42.602 --> 38:44.553
I fell in love with Brandi.

38:50.109 --> 38:54.946
And Karen knew she wasn't
getting a payday, huh?

38:54.997 --> 38:56.281
She killed Mr. Raines

38:56.332 --> 38:57.649
because she thought that if...

38:57.700 --> 39:01.253
if my wife inherited his money,
I'd pay her off.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.821
You just killed her instead?

39:05.842 --> 39:07.492
I went over there
to reason with her.

39:07.543 --> 39:10.328
Okay? Things...

39:10.379 --> 39:12.597
I mean, they got out of control.

39:12.665 --> 39:14.783
I just... I wanted her
out of my life.

39:15.834 --> 39:17.835
Bobby trusted you.

39:20.823 --> 39:22.674
He gave you his daughter,
but now...

39:27.730 --> 39:29.731
He gave you his daughter.

39:33.369 --> 39:35.370
I'm sorry.

39:42.194 --> 39:43.545
Not good enough.

39:50.753 --> 39:52.754
♪ ♪

40:13.442 --> 40:14.442
Hey.

40:16.895 --> 40:19.247
♪ ♪

40:24.403 --> 40:25.720
I'm sorry.

40:48.778 --> 40:51.212
It's nice.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.447
I think Tony had it right:

40:52.531 --> 40:53.598
the whole shoe thing's
overrated.

40:53.649 --> 40:56.601
Nice.

40:56.652 --> 40:58.937
Look, on that... I mean, if this
is something you're gonna do...

40:59.005 --> 41:01.206
regularly...

41:01.273 --> 41:03.308
you should invest
in some nail clippers, Danny.

41:03.376 --> 41:05.327
No, no. I-I didn't...

41:05.411 --> 41:07.412
I didn't say that it's gonna
be a lifestyle choice.

41:07.463 --> 41:09.331
You know, I just...
I'm enjoying it; it feels good.

41:09.415 --> 41:11.216
It does feel good.
That it does, my friend.

41:11.283 --> 41:12.200
That it does.

41:12.268 --> 41:14.252
And you know what else?

41:14.303 --> 41:16.304
We got everything
we need right here.

41:16.389 --> 41:17.639
No. No. We don't
have everything we need

41:17.723 --> 41:18.974
because this guy--
he promised me

41:19.058 --> 41:20.425
an authentic slice
of New York pizza--

41:20.476 --> 41:22.126
a real, authentic
New York slice.

41:22.178 --> 41:24.479
And all he did was bring us
to the <i>SS Minnow</i> here.

41:24.563 --> 41:25.647
Yeah, what's with that?

41:25.731 --> 41:27.649
Depressing,
and it's... it's not honest.

41:27.717 --> 41:30.318
Tony! I am starving.
What's going on?

41:30.403 --> 41:32.404
Put a sock in it,
will you?

41:34.357 --> 41:35.607
Here she comes.

41:35.658 --> 41:37.075
The one, the only,
original Ray's,

41:37.142 --> 41:38.994
flown in direct.

41:39.078 --> 41:42.998
Now. When Tony Archer
promises you something,

41:43.082 --> 41:45.116
you can bet you get it...
50% of the time anyway.

41:45.167 --> 41:47.252
Here. Try it.
You're a good man.

41:47.319 --> 41:49.170
You're a good man, Tony.

41:49.255 --> 41:50.171
This is beautiful.

41:50.256 --> 41:53.157
All right.
This is sweet.

41:53.209 --> 41:55.210
What are you doing?
You fold... you fold it up?

41:55.294 --> 41:56.594
This is good.

41:56.662 --> 41:57.879
Fold it up.
Bend it over.

41:57.963 --> 42:00.148
Oh, this is good.

42:02.184 --> 42:04.836
That's a... that's a good
piece of pizza right there.

42:04.887 --> 42:06.054
No, no, no, no.

42:06.138 --> 42:07.605
See, where we come from,
you don't say "piece."

42:07.673 --> 42:08.857
It's a "slice."
We call it a slice.

42:08.941 --> 42:10.458
Slice.
No, hold on. Don't try to, um,

42:10.526 --> 42:12.644
domesticate him.
He's an animal.

42:12.695 --> 42:13.962
Trust me.
I'm not an animal.

42:14.030 --> 42:15.230
You were born an animal.

42:15.314 --> 42:17.014
You're gonna be an animal
for the rest of your life.

42:17.066 --> 42:18.516
It's pizza. What makes me an animal?
Hold-hold it.

42:18.567 --> 42:19.534
Hold it. Hold it.
Huh?

42:19.618 --> 42:20.869
Let me ask you something.

42:20.953 --> 42:23.104
You two hens peck at each other
like this all the time?

42:23.172 --> 42:24.856
All the time?
- No. - Yeah.

42:24.907 --> 42:26.357
Absolutely.
No, no.

42:26.409 --> 42:28.293
Well...
Come on.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.161
I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

42:30.212 --> 42:31.496
'Cause I'm a good guy.

42:31.547 --> 42:34.031
And more importantly, I need
some laughs in my life.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.633
I'm gonna be your
marriage counselor.

42:35.701 --> 42:38.553
Thank you.
You got a problem with a case,

42:38.621 --> 42:40.805
or any time you
need help, basically,

42:40.873 --> 42:41.990
I'll be here for you.

42:42.058 --> 42:44.476
Okay? Could we have
a little group hug here?

42:44.543 --> 42:46.010
Oh, yeah.
All right. Love you.

42:46.062 --> 42:48.329
Now let's eat this pizza.
I got three of them.

42:48.397 --> 42:50.198
You do?
Sure do.

42:50.266 --> 42:52.901
Give me a hug.

42:52.985 --> 42:54.402
You're a good man.

42:54.487 --> 42:56.938
What's the difference?
Why's it so good in New York?

42:57.022 --> 42:58.940
You tell me.
The water's bromide.

42:59.024 --> 43:00.942
The water. Bromide?
It's bromide...
