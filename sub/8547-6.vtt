WEBVTT

00:07.750 --> 00:11.493
Boy, come on! Let's go.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.788
Good boy. Come here.

00:14.790 --> 00:18.453
Come on. Yeah. Yeah.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.702
Enough with the dog already.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.280
You haven't heard a single word I've said.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.819
I don't have time for this now.

00:28.290 --> 00:31.202
Okay, fine. Then make time for this.

00:31.210 --> 00:33.110
I'm telling your wife about us.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.326
No, you won't.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.615
Try and stop me.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.286
Come here.

00:40.830 --> 00:41.990
Go fetch!

00:42.540 --> 00:43.996
You're seriously threatening me?

00:45.330 --> 00:46.877
You just made a big mistake.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.241
Jeff? Let's talk about this.

01:02.210 --> 01:03.609
Jeff?

01:06.080 --> 01:08.071
Stay there. Don't come any closer.

01:15.380 --> 01:16.699
Hmm.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.706
Pizza is ready.

01:19.170 --> 01:20.614
I just don't get this.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.030
What's a cloud?

01:23.670 --> 01:27.822
Uh, you know, it's hard to explain.
It's a wireless upload to a server.

01:27.830 --> 01:30.663
There's actually data centers
called cloud farms.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.120
Ah, terrific. It took me a year to learn
how to scan these onto CDs

01:36.120 --> 01:39.078
and now I'm in a cloud farm.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.913
Don't worry about it. I'll help you.
I'll grab the pizza.

01:42.210 --> 01:44.110
Then it's off the bed, Henry, okay?

01:44.120 --> 01:46.372
Okay. Who's that?

01:47.080 --> 01:50.322
Well, that's your mama,

01:50.330 --> 01:53.572
and that's your Aunt Rosalind, honey.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.990
You don't know who she is?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.035
Mmm-mmm.

02:03.830 --> 02:05.616
Good night, buddy. Sleep tight.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.281
Good night, Mommy.

02:12.540 --> 02:16.078
Um, did you and Henry talk about
Rosalind this evening?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.997
Yeah, a little bit.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.377
He saw a picture of her and he asked.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.917
Uh-huh. And you told him she was dead?

02:23.920 --> 02:26.070
No. No.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.198
I explained to him that she was gone,
that she went to a better place.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.531
Okay, well, Henry just asked
if we could go visit her

02:32.540 --> 02:34.326
in this better place.

02:34.920 --> 02:38.378
Mom, I can't believe you told him
without even discussing it with me.

02:38.380 --> 02:40.029
I didn't go into details.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.917
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.708
Will and I have discussed this,
at length, okay?

02:45.710 --> 02:49.919
We decided that we would wait
until Henry was old enough

02:49.920 --> 02:52.457
-to broach the subject.
-We don't need to talk in code.

02:52.460 --> 02:55.702
Roz killed herself, and now I see
you making the same mistakes

02:55.710 --> 02:56.916
your father and I made.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.114
What are you talking about?

02:58.120 --> 03:01.499
For years we kept our heads in the sand
about Rosalind,

03:01.500 --> 03:02.819
ignored the warning signs.

03:02.830 --> 03:06.948
Maybe, maybe if we had just
dealt with her problems head-on,

03:06.960 --> 03:08.496
she'd still be with us.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.788
You're an adult. Henry is a child.
There's a big difference.

03:11.790 --> 03:15.248
I don't see how the truth harms anyone,
adults or children.

03:15.250 --> 03:18.208
Okay, so what am I supposed to tell him
if he asks how she...

03:22.790 --> 03:23.825
Hmm.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.410
I gotta go. It's work.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.871
Go. We're fine here.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.279
Mom...

03:32.120 --> 03:34.998
Do not say anything
more to Henry about Roz.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.245
Please.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.877
I won't. Don't worry.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.571
Avoidance is what
this family does best, anyhow.

03:52.420 --> 03:54.615
Hi. Good evening.

03:54.620 --> 03:59.068
Okay. University of Montana
student Douglas Clark

03:59.080 --> 04:02.618
was found this afternoon next to his car,
stabbed at least a dozen times,

04:02.620 --> 04:04.497
and the killer left a calling card.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.876
That's a distinctive signature.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.609
Have there been similar
murders reported In the area?

04:07.620 --> 04:08.780
Thankfully, no.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.530
So then why are we being called in?

04:10.540 --> 04:13.498
Last month a local shopkeeper
was killed in a hit-and-run.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.617
The driver was a student
who's very rIch and well connected.

04:16.620 --> 04:18.417
Daddy got him off
with a slap on the wrist.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.741
Which I imagine didn't sit well
with the locals.

04:20.750 --> 04:21.876
Oh, you could say that.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.280
A random fraternity was firebombed
in retaliation.

04:24.290 --> 04:26.417
And there's concern that the murder
mIght escalate the friction

04:26.420 --> 04:28.536
between the student community
and the permanent residents.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.201
Town versus gown. It happens.

04:30.210 --> 04:32.576
All the way back to the Battle
of Saint Scholastica Day.

04:35.710 --> 04:39.168
Okay, I'll take the bait. What is the...
Whatever it is that you just said?

04:39.170 --> 04:41.286
The Battle of Saint Scholastica Day?
I'm glad you asked.

04:41.290 --> 04:42.826
Oxford University, 1335,

04:42.830 --> 04:45.742
citizens attacked students
and professors wrth bows and arrows.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.071
Fighting went on for two days
and nearly 100 people were killed.

04:49.210 --> 04:51.576
You know, it's probably
just my easygoing nature,

04:51.580 --> 04:54.162
but ifI stabbed someone a dozen times,

04:54.170 --> 04:56.070
it'd pretty much be out of my system.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.741
Why smash a car window?

04:57.750 --> 05:00.457
Well, a car killed the shopkeeper.
Maybe it's a message.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.826
Or just plain anger, and a lot of it.

05:02.830 --> 05:04.115
Whatever the reason,
we have to assume

05:04.120 --> 05:05.530
there's more where that came from.

05:05.540 --> 05:07.030
Wheels up in 30.

06:14.420 --> 06:17.821
"Deep vengeance is
the daughter of deep silence."

06:17.830 --> 06:19.457
Vittorio Alfieri.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.916
The coroner's report
puts the time of death

06:21.920 --> 06:24.707
00 am.
the previous night.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.662
This doesn't feel like payback
for the hit-and-run driver.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.820
Clark was stabbed 12 times.
That's personal.

06:29.830 --> 06:33.414
He was quiet. Kept to himself.
No problems with the locals.

06:33.420 --> 06:36.036
Clark did come from the same
privileged gene pool as the other kid.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.201
Money, education, influence.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.872
There's not much blood on_ the_scene
given the extent of the Injuries.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.324
Clark must have been killed somewhere else

06:42.330 --> 06:44.241
and then dragged into
the woods and abandoned.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.457
Okay, thing one, a search
on Douglas Clark's cell phone

06:46.460 --> 06:49.372
turned up a cache of pornography.
The non-heterosexual kind.

06:49.380 --> 06:50.608
Well, that changes the equation.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.781
If the victim was gay,
we could be looking at a hate crime.

06:52.790 --> 06:54.997
And I wouldn't have said
"thing one" if there wasn't a thing two.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.412
A new body was just discovered
a mile away from the first victim.

06:57.420 --> 06:58.614
No details yet.

06:58.620 --> 07:00.030
So much for a cooling-off period.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.576
All right, when we land,
Dave, you and Reid

07:01.580 --> 07:03.116
go directly to the new crime scene.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.530
Morgan and JJ, talk to the ME,

07:04.540 --> 07:06.326
and Kate and I will
coordinate with local law enforcement

07:06.330 --> 07:07.877
and find out what we can
about Douglas Clark.

07:14.290 --> 07:15.609
MISSOU LA, MONTANA

07:15.620 --> 07:18.669
Five-thirty in the morning, east
coast time. You don't seem tired at all.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.240
What can I tell you? I'm a night person.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.706
Speaking of that,
you might want to consider

07:21.710 --> 07:24.452
revamping your circadian clock
to a more traditional chronotype.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.576
Yeah, I'll put that on my to-do list.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.377
Seriously, studies
have found that night owls

07:29.380 --> 07:31.200
show reduced integrity
of white matter in their brain

07:31.210 --> 07:32.700
compared to early risers.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.780
While I appreciate your concern,

07:34.790 --> 07:38.112
I'm very happy with my brain
just like it is.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.200
There's a lot more damage to this car.

07:42.210 --> 07:44.701
Look, the tires are punctured
and all the windows are broken.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.878
Our killer's getting bolder.
The car's in plain sight.

07:48.580 --> 07:50.878
Given the proximity
to the earlier crime scene,

07:50.880 --> 07:53.531
he _had to know there'd
be a police presence in this area.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.706
Oh, bite marks.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.070
Douglas Clark's cell didn't have that.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.207
The phone was put into
Clark's mouth postmortem.

08:09.210 --> 08:11.701
This victim must have still been alive.

08:11.710 --> 08:15.328
Well, let's see if this baby
holds any surprises.

08:16.750 --> 08:18.320
It's an honor to be working with the BAU.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.661
We're glad to be of help.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.701
-This is the latest victim?
-Kevin Brubaker.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.280
Senior here at the university.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.497
Oh, wow.
The killer and I have the same type.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.286
Dark-haired handsome guys in their 205.

08:29.290 --> 08:30.666
Both had money, too.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.740
Drove nice cars, rented high-end condos.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.661
A hair fiber that wasn't Brubaker's
as found at the scene.

08:34.670 --> 08:35.876
We're checking for DNA.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.529
Do we know Brubaker's sexual orientation?

08:37.540 --> 08:40.373
No, but your agent sent back
a cell phone with one of our officers.

08:40.380 --> 08:41.699
We're looking through it now.

08:41.710 --> 08:43.746
We need to speak to someone
who knew Douglas Clark.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.321
Terence Reynolds.
Came in three hours ago on his own.

08:46.330 --> 08:47.911
Says he's the victim's partner.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.663
He was ashamed.
That's why I ended our relationship.

08:52.460 --> 08:54.781
-Who else knew Douglas was gay?
-Nobody.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.327
He was scared to death
people would find out.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.957
So he didn't have a social life?

08:59.960 --> 09:01.666
He did. A phoney one.

09:03.170 --> 09:06.162
He avoided gay hangouts,
he only went to straight bars,

09:06.170 --> 09:08.240
and he dated women
to keep people from suspecting.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.910
Do you know a Kevin Brubaker?

09:12.540 --> 09:14.952
-No. Why?

09:16.080 --> 09:17.411
Excuse me.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.450
What is it?

09:21.460 --> 09:23.667
We found something
on Brubaker's cell phone.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.879
Okay, this is for mature
viewing audiences only.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.745
Viewer discretion is advised.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.788
That's just about right.

09:46.710 --> 09:48.416
All right, let's get this party started.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.206
Spoiler alert.

10:14.210 --> 10:17.168
There's another minute or so
of that tender, nuanced foreplay

10:17.170 --> 10:18.819
and then Brubaker seals the deal.

10:18.830 --> 10:20.616
And she had no idea he was filming her.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.453
We found three other videos like this
with three different women.

10:23.460 --> 10:25.246
He circulated them
to a few of his buddies.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.990
And they say chivalry is dead.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.992
Anything on the phone to indicate
a gay or bisexual lifestyle?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.743
No. If Brubaker wasn't straight,
he did an enthusiastic job of faking it.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.411
We're trying to identify
the three women now,

10:35.420 --> 10:37.957
in case we're dealing
with an angry boyfriend or a relative.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.451
Angry boyfriend doesn't explain
Douglas Clark's murder.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.451
The UnSub's victim selection criteria
might not be

10:42.460 --> 10:43.779
as simple as gay versus straight.

10:43.790 --> 10:45.667
-It could be more generalized.
-In what way?

10:45.670 --> 10:47.160
He could be targeting
any sexual behavior

10:47.170 --> 10:49.240
that he perceives as
deviant or unwholesome.

10:50.210 --> 10:51.495
A closeted gay man.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.037
A jerk like Brubaker
who violates his partner's trust.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.535
We need to find out how he learns

10:56.540 --> 10:58.076
the details of his victims' lives.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.536
And how he finds them
in the first place.

11:08.620 --> 11:10.167
Have you determined a COD yet?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.377
Sometimes what you see
is what you get.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.416
Both victims died
from being stabbed a lot.

11:14.830 --> 11:18.288
Mr. Clark's was pretty savage, actually.
Lots of defensive wounds.

11:18.290 --> 11:19.575
Knife?

11:19.580 --> 11:21.320
More like a two-bladed instrument.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.412
Heaw-duty scissors, gardening shears.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.747
Flesh tears were jagged and deep. Messy.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.115
What about Brubaker?

11:28.120 --> 11:31.248
The same murder weapon,
but a couple significant differences.

11:31.790 --> 11:34.247
The lacerations were
deliberate and preCIse,

11:34.250 --> 11:37.742
ligature marks on the wrists and ankles,
and no defensive wounds at all.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.286
Like he'd been held down and tortured.

11:39.290 --> 11:42.532
Yes, except the bindings
were mild in terms of severity of force

11:42.540 --> 11:43.746
and duration of application.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.570
Not enough to seriously
restrain the victim.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.786
Exactly.

11:46.790 --> 11:50.112
So how did the UnSub control Brubaker
if he was still alive?

11:50.120 --> 11:51.610
Well, there's no drugs in his tox screen.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.166
Gun, maybe.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.614
Some of the stab wounds

11:54.620 --> 11:56.668
could maybe have come
from earlier, weakening him.

11:56.670 --> 12:00.242
There was one anomaly
consistent with both victims.

12:02.540 --> 12:06.032
Right here and here.

12:06.620 --> 12:07.700
Puncture wounds.

12:07.710 --> 12:10.998
Wide at the surface, tapering to
a narrow point deep in the tissue.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.740
Any idea what it could be?

12:12.750 --> 12:14.035
No, ma'am.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.827
Frankly, I've never seen
a wound quite like it before.

12:30.420 --> 12:31.785
Excuse me.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.576
I think you dropped something.

12:40.380 --> 12:43.031
The UnSub took a big risk
going back to this location.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.701
It must have special meaning.

12:44.710 --> 12:46.200
What do you mean?

12:46.960 --> 12:49.747
No second set of tread marks
found at either crime scene.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.378
Means the killer probably left on foot.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.780
There is a residential
area about a half mile away

12:54.790 --> 12:56.246
if he cut southeast through the woods.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.376
Thank you.

12:58.330 --> 12:59.706
You were right.

13:00.330 --> 13:01.706
The other alarm was set.

13:01.710 --> 13:03.246
Alarm?
-Police report said

13:03.250 --> 13:05.070
that Douglas Clark's cell phone alarm
was going off

13:05.080 --> 13:06.536
when the couple with the dog found him.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.576
00
the previous evening,

13:08.580 --> 13:11.071
so I had forensics check to see
if Brubaker's alarm had also been set.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.991
It had. Also for midnight.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.956
Hey, guys. Take a look at this.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.417
I had the Tech Department here
construct a 3D image

13:17.420 --> 13:20.116
of the shape of the weapon used
to make the mystery punctures

13:20.120 --> 13:21.530
on Clark and Brubaker.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.747
At first I thought it might
be some kind of funnel

13:23.750 --> 13:25.320
you'd use in the yard.

13:25.330 --> 13:28.072
The M.E. did say the murder weapon
could have been gardening shears.

13:28.420 --> 13:30.115
Mmm-hmm.
But then another thought hit me.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.374
So I went browsing through the latest
Jimmy Choo catalogue.

13:36.830 --> 13:40.459
Virtually the same size and shape.

13:40.710 --> 13:43.372
Okay, now, it's not necessarily
this particular label.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.951
But the puncture could have been
caused by a stiletto heel.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.576
If Douglas Clark was gay
and the UnSub was wearing these,

13:48.580 --> 13:50.207
we could be looking
for a male cross-dresser.

13:50.210 --> 13:52.496
But the puncture wound
was also on Kevin Brubaker,

13:52.500 --> 13:54.411
and we know Douglas
dated women as a cover.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.530
I think the UnSub might be a woman.

14:02.790 --> 14:06.328
So, let's get the awkward questions
out of the way.

14:07.250 --> 14:08.820
-Are you married?
-No.

14:09.170 --> 14:11.616
-Boyfriend -No. No.

14:12.210 --> 14:16.112
Good. Then how about some Thai?
I mean, it's almost lunchtime.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.452
And I'll be the perfect gentleman.
Promise.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.246
We don't even know each other.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.741
Yeah, but I mean,
that's how it works, right?

14:24.790 --> 14:26.417
YOU meet someone and...

14:26.420 --> 14:27.705
Magic.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.289
Shane, you received via email
three videos from Kevin Brubaker

14:39.290 --> 14:42.782
of him having sex with three different
female college students.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.490
Can't control what I'm emailed.

14:48.250 --> 14:52.619
He also sent you these
two days before the videos,

14:52.620 --> 14:54.576
sort of like a preview
of the coming attractions.

14:57.670 --> 15:00.286
My buddy just died.
Is this going anywhere?

15:00.830 --> 15:02.411
Yeah.

15:03.710 --> 15:05.450
Did your buddy have
another woman lined up?

15:06.080 --> 15:07.320
Kevin always had women lined up.

15:07.330 --> 15:10.618
I mean like a specific woman,
maybe in the last couple of days.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.458
Look, it is in your best interest
to cooperate with us, Shane.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.917
I mean, you did receive videos
taken of these women

15:16.920 --> 15:18.114
without their permission.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.952
Montana may be a two-party consent state,

15:21.960 --> 15:23.871
but you probably noticed
Kevin turned the audio off.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.996
Consent isn't required
without the audio component.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.321
Therefore, I wasn't involved
in anything illegal.

15:30.170 --> 15:31.455
I'm pre-law.

15:31.460 --> 15:32.609
Oh...

15:32.620 --> 15:37.205
And I'm sure you are gonna have
a wonderful career sometime in 2035.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.531
Consent issues don't apply to child porn.

15:41.460 --> 15:42.825
What?

15:42.830 --> 15:44.991
Well, let's just say
one of these girls was,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.321
I don't know, two months shy
of her 18th birthday.

15:47.330 --> 15:50.379
That's child porn, video or audio,
whatever, it doesn't really matter.

15:50.380 --> 15:54.248
And child porn carries a mandatory
minimum of 20 years in prison.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.036
But I am sure that you knew that,

15:56.040 --> 15:58.110
what with your pre-law background.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.412
I did not...
Didn't know... I never would have...

16:02.670 --> 16:03.785
I'm gonna be sick.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.530
Okay, so let's try it again.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.662
Did Kevin Brubaker
talk about another woman

16:08.670 --> 16:10.786
that he was planning on videotaping?

16:10.790 --> 16:13.247
-Yes.
-Did he describe her or give a name?

16:13.250 --> 16:17.459
No. She was a townie,
impressed by his car.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.537
All Kevin said was that she was weird.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.578
-Weird how?
-I don't know. Old-fashioned.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.496
Didn't even have a cell phone.

16:27.170 --> 16:29.240
Her dress had a tag
still hanging off of it.

16:31.210 --> 16:32.666
Really, I'm gonna puke.

16:41.380 --> 16:43.826
None of the girls Brubaker filmed
were underage.

16:43.830 --> 16:46.572
Oh, gosh. Do you think I gave Shane
the wrong impression?

16:48.380 --> 16:49.995
I kind of like your style, Callahan.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.707
Somebody should get a barf bag
for our legal eagle in there.

16:57.540 --> 16:59.280
You know, I thought I'd blown it.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.372
In the car after lunch,
I came on kind of strong

17:01.380 --> 17:03.109
and you got weird there for a second.

17:03.120 --> 17:06.112
But I get it. You shut me down
when I try to sample the goods,

17:06.120 --> 17:08.247
then come back home and
start getting freaky.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.912
Slow it down, huh? We got all afternoon.

17:22.380 --> 17:23.950
This really your room?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.279
Yes. Why?

17:25.290 --> 17:27.611
It's just different, that's all.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.912
The planets and stuff on your ceiling.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.616
I like that they're
the last things I see at night.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.991
Don't you ever wish upon a star?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.993
-No, but after today, I'm gonna start.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.820
-It won't do any good.
-Whoa.

17:46.170 --> 17:47.740
What the hell's going on here?

17:48.540 --> 17:51.498
You think you can make a mockery of this.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.279
Uh...

17:54.290 --> 17:55.575
What are you talking about?

17:55.580 --> 17:59.619
You take love and beauty and enchantment

17:59.620 --> 18:03.249
and you turn it into something ugly!

18:03.250 --> 18:05.241
Hey, you're starting
to freak me out. Okay?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.615
Untie me, now!

18:06.960 --> 18:08.370
What are you doing?

18:18.120 --> 18:21.419
Wouldn't mind having the window
replacement franchise in this town.

18:24.210 --> 18:25.871
Well...

18:26.790 --> 18:28.746
No phone, but there's
something in his mouth.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.287
And the alarm is set to midnight.

18:36.170 --> 18:38.115
Rossi, look at that.
He was clearly restrained.

18:38.620 --> 18:40.201
What's that on his arm?

18:40.750 --> 18:42.377
Don't quote me, but I think that's ash.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.490
The UnSub we're looking for is a woman

18:45.500 --> 18:47.741
we refer to as a female annihilator,

18:47.750 --> 18:50.958
a black widow who lures men in
most likely With the promise of sex

18:50.960 --> 18:52.279
and then kills them.

18:52.290 --> 18:53.917
We don't yet know what
triggered these murders,

18:53.920 --> 18:57.321
but it's most likely connected
to a specific person or event.

18:57.330 --> 18:58.877
The trauma is profound.

19:00.290 --> 19:02.747
She's probably in her
early 205 and attractive,

19:02.750 --> 19:05.071
which is how she's able to
draw in her preferred targets

19:05.080 --> 19:06.616
of affluent, handsome, young men.

19:07.620 --> 19:10.783
But she herself may live humbly,
without much money.

19:10.790 --> 19:12.496
One of her victims characterized her

19:12.500 --> 19:15.037
as a townie impressed by
his luxury vehicle.

19:15.670 --> 19:18.241
The killer inserts
a cell phone or wristwatch

19:18.250 --> 19:20.992
into her victims' mouths,
sets the alarm for midnight.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.822
It's her way of saying "Time's up"
or "A new day dawns but not for you."

19:24.830 --> 19:26.377
Putting objects in mouths

19:26.380 --> 19:28.996
is also a symbolic way
to silence or gag victims.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.070
This could also indicate that the UnSub

19:31.080 --> 19:33.116
feels her own voice has not been heard.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.872
If the triggering event
was an assault

19:34.880 --> 19:36.279
suffered by the UnSub herself,

19:36.290 --> 19:38.781
she might feel that she was denied
the justice that she deserved.

19:39.170 --> 19:42.708
So she's appointed herself
judge, jury, and executioner,

19:42.710 --> 19:44.951
killing surrogates for her own attacker.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.611
Look closely at recent victims
of sexual assault

19:47.620 --> 19:49.747
where charges weren't filed
because the accused

19:49.750 --> 19:51.286
was either wealthy or connected.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.609
With the most recent victim,

19:52.620 --> 19:56.329
for the first time, we found ash residue
in the car and on the body.

19:56.330 --> 19:59.288
This ritual aspect could
symbolize the UnSub's rebirth,

19:59.290 --> 20:02.202
like the phoenix rising
from its ashes to live again.

20:02.210 --> 20:05.611
And with this sense of resurrection
she experiences With each of the kills,

20:05.620 --> 20:08.248
we expect her to become
more emboldened and more dangerous.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.456
Thank you.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.075
Five times you've been late this month.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.617
I deducted 20 bucks from your salary.
Maybe that'll help you learn.

20:14.620 --> 20:17.168
Sorry, Mr. Jensen. It won't happen again.

20:17.170 --> 20:18.535
Yeah, I've heard that before.

20:18.540 --> 20:19.780
Next time you show up late,

20:19.790 --> 20:21.280
turn your ass around
and go back out the door.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.576
Find another job.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.575
Good afternoon. Can I help you?

20:27.580 --> 20:29.616
Hey, how you doing?
I'm picking up some dry-cleaning.

20:29.620 --> 20:30.951
Yeah, sure, no problem.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.279
I dropped it off this morning.

20:32.290 --> 20:34.030
All right,
it'll just take a second.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.077
I'm sorry. My dad shouldn't
talk to you like that.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.457
There you go, sir. That'll be $42.

20:39.790 --> 20:41.109
It's okay.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.997
And I'll make sure
you get the money he took.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.453
Listen, I was thinking
about catching a movie tonight.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.070
I thought maybe you'd like to go.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.958
Oh... Sorry.
I already have plans. It's a date.

20:56.670 --> 20:57.910
Oh.

20:57.920 --> 21:01.287
Okay. Maybe another time.

21:16.460 --> 21:19.497
The price tags were still on the dress.
Maybe the UnSub stole it.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.821
I'll have Garcia look into local vintage
and secondhand shops.

21:21.830 --> 21:23.957
Maybe an employee or customer
fits our profile?

21:23.960 --> 21:25.245
Also have her check police records

21:25.250 --> 21:27.206
for young women recently arrested
for shoplifting.

21:27.210 --> 21:29.451
What if the stealing of clothing
isn't about finances,

21:29.460 --> 21:31.075
just part of her overall psychosis?

21:31.080 --> 21:32.490
Maybe.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.876
It's an impulse control disorder

21:33.880 --> 21:35.666
three times more prominent
in women than in men.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.410
Researchers believe that compulsive thefts

21:37.420 --> 21:39.240
could be a response
to early childhood trauma.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.616
They're trying to symbolically
repossess what was lost in childhood.

21:41.620 --> 21:43.167
But a true kleptomaniac
doesn't steal

21:43.170 --> 21:44.455
for financial gain or personal use,

21:44.460 --> 21:45.950
-and she's wearing _what she's stealing.

21:47.290 --> 21:48.575
What is it, Jennifer?

21:49.790 --> 21:52.372
Young, handsome men with money and status.

21:52.380 --> 21:54.746
A high-heeled shoe
one might wear to a dance.

21:54.750 --> 21:58.413
Luxury transportation that at the
stroke of midnight reverts to junk,

21:58.420 --> 21:59.990
and what's another name for soot?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.160
Cinders.

22:01.830 --> 22:03.741
It's a fairy tale gone horribly wrong.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.877
Fairy tale? You mean like...

22:05.880 --> 22:08.610
Our UnSub sees herself
as an avenging Cinderella.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.747
Cinderella

22:11.750 --> 22:14.662
Our UnSub obviously feels
her life mirrors that of Cinderella,

22:14.670 --> 22:15.910
so start there.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.114
All right, go back 15 years,

22:17.120 --> 22:19.372
see if law enforcement _
or child serwces were called in

22:19.380 --> 22:21.701
to deal with _ _
a step-parent/step-child Situation.

22:21.710 --> 22:23.951
You know what, Garcia?
Also check the foster care system,

22:23.960 --> 22:26.076
particularly instances
where girls were put into homes

22:26.080 --> 22:28.617
where favored biological daughters
were already in place.

22:28.620 --> 22:31.418
Per usual, your suggestions
have made the impossibleness

22:31.420 --> 22:34.241
of this endeavor seem possible.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.911
I will hit you back
when I have more intel.

22:37.710 --> 22:39.996
So if she's Cinderella,
who are the victims?

22:40.250 --> 22:42.411
Prince Charmings who didn't
live up to her fantasy.

22:51.750 --> 22:52.990
Dad, what's the matter?

22:54.040 --> 22:57.077
Mrs. Jordan came in to pick up
her daughter's dress.

22:57.080 --> 23:00.038
It isn't here and she needs it
for a wedding this weekend.

23:01.290 --> 23:02.780
That's it. Claire's fired.

23:03.290 --> 23:04.700
Fired

23:04.710 --> 23:07.167
This is the third dress gone missing
since she's been here.

23:07.170 --> 23:09.377
She's not just fired.
I'm having her arrested.

23:09.380 --> 23:11.280
Wait. Don't do that.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.780
Why not? She's a thief.

23:12.790 --> 23:16.374
Let me go to her house.
I'll bring the dress back

23:16.380 --> 23:18.280
and tell her she doesn't
have a job here anymore.

23:19.830 --> 23:21.661
She's not a bad person.

23:21.670 --> 23:23.706
You want to take care of it? Go ahead.

23:23.710 --> 23:25.746
But I better not see her_
face around here ever again.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.377
I'll do it the first thing tomorrow.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.741
I had to dig deep into
the storage shed for this.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.069
We don't get much call for champagne.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.745
Thank you.

23:44.330 --> 23:45.957
Poor girl looks lonely.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.537
Think I'll go introduce myself.

23:49.540 --> 23:51.201
Proceed with caution, bro.

23:51.210 --> 23:52.370
What for?

23:55.670 --> 23:57.661
Some serious crazy going on up in there.

23:58.790 --> 24:01.167
One man's crazy is another man's kink.

24:03.670 --> 24:04.910
I wouldn't do it.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.576
Love your dress.

24:12.580 --> 24:14.161
Thank you.

24:14.170 --> 24:15.706
The name's John.

24:15.710 --> 24:18.372
And I mean it, you are really
decked out tonight.

24:18.380 --> 24:22.919
I thought this was a place
where you could dance.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.821
This place? Not hardly.

24:26.830 --> 24:27.876
Oh...

24:31.210 --> 24:32.609
Do you feel like dancing?

24:34.960 --> 24:36.370
Then let's do it.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.708
Be sure to take pictures. Okay. Bye.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.746
-Got anything new?
-Yeah. All three cars

25:08.750 --> 25:11.241
had the driver's seat adjusted
as far forward as possible,

25:11.250 --> 25:13.206
which means the UnSub's probably short.

25:13.210 --> 25:14.529
I'm assuming under 5'4".

25:18.080 --> 25:19.877
Everything okay?

25:19.880 --> 25:22.701
Yeah. Yeah, that was my mom.
She's up visiting for a couple days.

25:22.710 --> 25:23.916
Nice.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.821
Yeah, yeah.
She and Henry are gonna go to the zoo.

25:26.830 --> 25:29.207
-Sounds like_fun. Or not.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.240
Uh...

25:32.250 --> 25:34.662
She and I got into an argument
a couple nights ago

25:34.670 --> 25:36.376
and it's still a little tense.

25:36.380 --> 25:38.610
So... It's just not a big deal.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.827
What was it about?
If you don't mind me asking.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.279
Um...

25:43.290 --> 25:47.454
Well, my mother believes that children
shouldn't be shielded

25:47.460 --> 25:49.166
from the realities of the world.

25:49.170 --> 25:53.072
I do. I mean, isn't that why we read
them fairy tales in the first place?

25:53.080 --> 25:55.662
No, actually, most fairy tales
in their original form

25:55.670 --> 25:57.160
were gruesome to the extreme.

25:57.170 --> 25:59.821
In Cinderella, the stepsisters
had their feet mutilated

25:59.830 --> 26:03.573
to fit into the shoe, and their eyes
were eventually pecked out by doves.

26:03.580 --> 26:06.572
Sleeping Beauty was raped while
she was unconscious by the king.

26:06.580 --> 26:09.322
Hansel and Gretel were held captive
by a half-blind cannibal.

26:09.330 --> 26:12.743
Soldiers were instructed
to cut out Snow White's liver and lungs

26:12.750 --> 26:14.320
so the Queen could feast upon them.

26:14.330 --> 26:15.820
Thanks for that, Spence.

26:15.830 --> 26:18.321
My point is, one could argue

26:18.330 --> 26:20.787
that the sanitized versions we have today

26:20.790 --> 26:24.829
are actually counterproductive
to the original purpose of fairy tales.

26:25.420 --> 26:28.207
So that children could safely confront
their darkest fears.

26:30.210 --> 26:31.871
Maybe my mom was right.

26:32.750 --> 26:36.038
The UnSub believed
in the fairy tale, not in reality.

26:37.750 --> 26:38.910
This is the result.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.868
It's been a wonderful evening.
Almost magical.

26:52.330 --> 26:55.538
Are you from Missoula?
Because I haven't seen you around before.

26:56.290 --> 26:58.952
-You date much?
-No.

26:59.540 --> 27:00.780
Neven

27:01.290 --> 27:05.613
Well, you can't say never.
This is sort of like a date.

27:06.670 --> 27:08.319
That's true.

27:08.920 --> 27:13.948
I hadn't gone out with a man, ever,
until last week.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.280
-You serious?
-Mmm-hmm.

27:18.250 --> 27:19.615
Why not?

27:19.620 --> 27:22.498
It's important to wait
for the right person.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.740
The only person.

27:25.750 --> 27:27.706
Yeah, okay.

27:27.710 --> 27:30.702
So what happened with the guy
from last week

27:32.620 --> 27:36.784
I thought he was a good man,
honest and true, but he wasn't.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.280
What?

27:40.920 --> 27:43.536
You have a funny way
of saying things sometimes.

27:44.670 --> 27:46.490
"Honest and true."

27:51.120 --> 27:52.496
ButI like it.

28:08.170 --> 28:10.161
-Don't do that.
-What's the matter?

28:10.170 --> 28:11.876
-Stop!
-I thought you liked it.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.165
I said, "No"!

28:13.170 --> 28:14.660
What the hell's the matter with you?

28:17.080 --> 28:18.616
Let me out of this car!

28:19.460 --> 28:21.030
Psycho bitch!

28:58.790 --> 29:00.326
Reid.

29:00.670 --> 29:01.876
John Franklin.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.451
Garcia said he used his credit card
at a nightclub downtown last night.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.207
Vehicle undamaged.

29:09.210 --> 29:11.997
Blunt force trauma instead of stabbing.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.206
Was there anything in his mouth?

29:13.210 --> 29:15.997
No. The UnSub is devolving.
This kill was much more disorganized.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.912
We're a good 15 miles
away from the other crime scenes.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.205
At least this time she was gracious enough

29:20.210 --> 29:21.746
to leave behind the murder weapon.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.661
Can I see this really quick?

29:26.790 --> 29:28.496
This was found impaled in his neck.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.530
Hi.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.246
What are you doing here?

29:51.250 --> 29:52.820
Uh... I thought I'd swing by.

29:53.960 --> 29:57.373
I actually need to talk to you
about something. Work stuff.

29:57.620 --> 30:00.578
I can't today. The bus will be here
in just a few minutes.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.820
Bus?

30:02.830 --> 30:06.994
These are for my father.
This is the day I go to the cemetery.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.035
Oh...

30:09.460 --> 30:11.610
Then um, let me take you.

30:13.250 --> 30:14.490
Really?

30:14.500 --> 30:17.116
Why not? I'm here. I've got my pickup.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.206
The bus is a hassle.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.571
I remember her. Hard person to forget.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.662
She was overdressed,
like a bridesmaid or something.

30:27.670 --> 30:30.457
And the dress, it didn't fit her.
It was at least a size too big.

30:30.460 --> 30:31.950
Did she come with anybody?

30:31.960 --> 30:34.372
No. Another customer came over to her

30:34.380 --> 30:36.701
and the two of them
did this sort of slow dance.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.166
And then they left.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.990
You could tell the guy
was just doing it as a goof,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.410
but she was totally into it.

30:42.380 --> 30:45.031
I noticed that you have surveillance
at the front entrance.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.701
Oh, yeah. Those don't work.

30:46.710 --> 30:48.780
It's just there to scare off
underage students.

30:48.790 --> 30:51.532
Well, listen, if you think of
anything else that might be helpful,

30:51.540 --> 30:52.950
please, give us a call.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.458
I will. I hope nothing
bad happened to her.

30:57.210 --> 30:59.872
Maybe she was a little bit off,
but she seemed like a really sweet girl.

31:08.670 --> 31:10.206
Garcia came up empty-handed.

31:10.210 --> 31:12.110
No one working at a clothing
store fits our profile.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.202
Same thing with arrest
records for female shoplifters.

31:15.120 --> 31:18.374
All right. Let's back up and look
at the changing MO sequentially.

31:18.380 --> 31:21.702
Douglas Clark had defensive
wounds, no ligature marks,

31:21.710 --> 31:23.666
the kill was sloppy
and probably not planned.

31:23.670 --> 31:25.911
But the next two victims
felt premeditated.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.821
Both Brubaker and Colin Baylor
were tied up willingly

31:28.830 --> 31:29.990
and killed with minimal resistance.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.379
It was as if the UnSub anticipated the
possibility of murder and was prepared.

31:33.380 --> 31:34.824
She assumed the role of the black widow.

31:34.830 --> 31:36.786
Except the latest victim
didn't fit the pattern.

31:36.790 --> 31:39.782
With John Franklin, the rock was
a weapon of opportunity.

31:39.790 --> 31:42.167
Exactly. The kill was spontaneous,
like Douglas Clark.

31:42.170 --> 31:43.319
Probably not planned.

31:43.330 --> 31:46.458
It's like she circled back to her mindset
prior to the first murder.

31:46.460 --> 31:49.827
The profile is slightly off.
She's not a black widow luring men in.

31:49.830 --> 31:51.991
Her delusion is hopeful and optimistic.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.662
You're right. Despite the blood and guts,

31:54.670 --> 31:57.070
she's still hoping for
a happily-ever-after ending.

32:01.710 --> 32:04.076
_I never even knew
this cemetery was here.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.492
He's buried over there
under that big tree.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.536
It's peaceful, isn't it?

32:09.620 --> 32:13.033
They don't sell flowers
anywhere near here,

32:13.040 --> 32:14.951
so, I just bring them myself.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.611
Well, obviously the UnSub
disassociates when she kills,

32:21.620 --> 32:22.780
but from what?

32:22.790 --> 32:24.451
If she's in her early 205,
that is the right age

32:24.460 --> 32:26.781
for sublimated trauma
to manifest as psych05is.

32:26.790 --> 32:30.453
What's curious is the competing
coexisting psychopathologies

32:30.460 --> 32:31.825
going on inside of her.

32:31.830 --> 32:34.458
Belief in the existence
of the perfect man.

32:34.460 --> 32:37.418
Yeah, and murderous rage at anyone
who falls short of that perfection.

32:37.420 --> 32:40.992
It's the kind of profound ambivalence
found in abuse and incest survivors.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.491
And that fact the she's
living this perfect fantasy

32:43.500 --> 32:44.819
means the stressor existed

32:44.830 --> 32:46.377
Oh!

32:46.790 --> 32:48.997
-You okay?
-Ah! That's so typical.

32:49.380 --> 32:51.450
My mother used to say
if clumsiness was a virtue,

32:51.460 --> 32:53.451
I would be anointed Katherine the First.

32:57.460 --> 32:58.745
What is it?

32:59.880 --> 33:01.074
Uh...

33:01.080 --> 33:04.072
The dress that the UnSub wore,
the bartender said it didn't fit right?

33:04.080 --> 33:05.377
She said it was too big.

33:06.080 --> 33:09.493
Which is strange, because the details
of her fantasies mean so much to her.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.785
You're right.
If she was stealing the dresses,

33:10.790 --> 33:11.950
why not steal a dress that fits?

33:11.960 --> 33:14.030
So, where else might clothes get tagged?

33:14.540 --> 33:15.825
The dry-cleaners.

33:17.540 --> 33:20.202
Got it. Claire Dunbar.
She works at Vic's Cleaners.

33:20.210 --> 33:21.370
Does she fit the profile?

33:21.380 --> 33:23.746
As snugly as I fit into
the chiseled arms of Derek Morgan.

33:23.750 --> 33:27.618
Her mother was institutionalized
shortly after her birth.

33:27.620 --> 33:30.783
The father raised her
on his own until he flaked.

33:30.790 --> 33:31.916
Wait flaked how?

33:31.920 --> 33:33.069
Looks like he couldn't handle it.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.661
Lost his job, ran out of money.
Left her at the mall

33:34.670 --> 33:37.457
with an apology note pinned to her blouse.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.111
And that put her
in the foster system.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.452
With a foster mom
and three biological daughters.

33:42.460 --> 33:44.951
Whoo.
That rings the Cinderella bell for me.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.615
You got an address, Garcia?

33:46.620 --> 33:49.168
I don't have one yet, but I do have
the address to the dry-cleaners.

33:49.170 --> 33:50.455
-I'm sending that now.-

33:50.790 --> 33:52.109
I'll check it out.

33:55.380 --> 33:56.870
Hey, what are you thinking?

33:57.830 --> 34:01.209
What we were talking about
earlier, sublimated trauma.

34:01.210 --> 34:04.577
Penelope, Claire Dunbar's father,
the one who abandoned her,

34:04.580 --> 34:06.116
did he ever surface again?

34:06.120 --> 34:07.747
Not that I can see, no.

34:07.750 --> 34:09.820
All right, listen.
Run the DNA from the hair ﬁber

34:09.830 --> 34:12.037
through the national database,
see if there's any near matches.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.530
97% or above, all right?

34:13.540 --> 34:14.916
-On it. Love you.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.819
Do you remember much
about your dad?

34:19.040 --> 34:21.827
Yes. They're the best memories I have.

34:22.920 --> 34:25.741
My father is the one
who gave me the love of books.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.991
He'd read to me every single night
before bed.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.319
Fairy tales mostly.

34:34.380 --> 34:36.951
My favorite was Cinderella.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.452
Are you sure this is your father's grave?

34:55.250 --> 34:57.377
Of course I'm sure.
I come here every week.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.569
I think a woman's buried here.

35:14.170 --> 35:16.912
And she died like almost 100 years ago.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.747
No. You're wrong.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.241
Talk to me, baby girl.
You got an address coming my way?

35:25.250 --> 35:26.740
I'm almost there.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.877
The trouble is, sometimes she uses
her mother's maiden name,

35:28.880 --> 35:32.919
which is...
Yes! Claire Rawley, aka Dunbar.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.114
2569—A Sagebrush Court.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.326
I'll get Hotch.

35:35.670 --> 35:36.989
Oh, oh...

35:37.000 --> 35:38.240
VVhat

35:38.250 --> 35:42.493
That DNA thing you asked me to do.
I got a near match. 99.5% near.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.378
Edward Rawley Banner of Twin Falls, Idaho.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.745
Rawley?

35:46.750 --> 35:48.286
That's Claire Dunbar's
mother's maiden name.

35:48.290 --> 35:49.575
Well, that has to be Claire's father.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.241
He just moved a state over
and stole the name.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.410
Is he still alive?

35:52.830 --> 35:55.162
Uh, negative.
He died of a heart attack in 2005.

35:55.170 --> 35:57.991
And I'll lay odds that his DNA is
on record 'cause he was incarcerated.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.285
You'll collect on that bet.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.326
He was arrested in 2002 and convicted...

36:02.750 --> 36:03.876
Pedophilia.

36:04.210 --> 36:06.576
And I know
who one of his victims was.

36:12.380 --> 36:14.109
Please don't touch that.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.702
I'm just making sure. I really think
your father is somewhere else.

36:17.330 --> 36:20.379
He's not somewhere else. He's right there,

36:20.380 --> 36:21.529
and I want to go home now.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.782
Let's find someone who works here
and ask them where he's buried.

36:25.380 --> 36:30.079
He's buried right there.
And I want to go home now!

36:31.830 --> 36:35.038
But, look, it says right here,
"Dorothy Carter."

37:00.580 --> 37:01.786
Clear.

37:01.790 --> 37:03.280
Clear.

37:03.750 --> 37:05.991
Hey, Hotch, in here.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.610
Yeah, Dave.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.536
Good. Send the number to Garcia.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.320
Claire Dunbar's not at her residence
or her workplace.

37:26.330 --> 37:27.536
But the owner of the dry-cleaners said

37:27.540 --> 37:28.780
that his son was supposed to
meet her this morning.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.371
Dave has sent you the son's
cell phone number.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.575
I need you to triangulate
and get me a location.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.241
Yeah, yeah, I'm already doing it, sir.

37:34.250 --> 37:36.411
In five, four, three, two, the

37:37.250 --> 37:39.536
phone is at a cemetery.
Oh, that can't be good.

37:39.540 --> 37:40.825
I'm sending the location now.

37:41.620 --> 37:42.917
Hey, Hotch, what do you have?

37:42.920 --> 37:45.411
_ We think Claire_Dunbar
is at Cypress Memorial Cemetery.

37:45.420 --> 37:46.819
That's out near Bonner Mountain.

37:46.830 --> 37:48.661
You're closer to the location than we are.

37:48.670 --> 37:50.535
All right, we're on our way.-Wait, Reid.

37:50.540 --> 37:51.950
There's something I want you
to take with you.

38:00.250 --> 38:03.742
This is him, and somebody changed it.

38:04.460 --> 38:08.169
Who changed it

38:10.210 --> 38:14.419
This all your fault.
I never should have brought you here.

38:14.670 --> 38:15.819
Stop. Please.

38:15.830 --> 38:18.663
What did you do to my father's grave?

38:18.670 --> 38:20.160
Tell me now!

38:20.170 --> 38:21.535
Claire, you don't need to do this.

38:21.540 --> 38:24.202
I'm not the one who ruined it. You did.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.617
Excuse me. May I approach?

38:27.620 --> 38:29.611
Who are you? Go away!

38:29.620 --> 38:32.077
Please, just give me the chance to speak.

38:33.670 --> 38:35.661
I've looked for so long.

38:36.120 --> 38:39.749
VVhat

38:39.750 --> 38:43.322
I've searched this entire city
trying to find the right person.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.206
Are you the right person?

38:46.710 --> 38:49.110
The dance, the other evening.
Do you remember?

38:52.460 --> 38:53.870
The dance?

38:53.880 --> 38:57.452
I met the most beautiful girl
I had ever seen in my life.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.327
We danced the whole night,
and then she was gone.

39:01.710 --> 39:03.666
But she left this behind.

39:12.830 --> 39:14.206
May I?

39:30.040 --> 39:32.076
I brought the carriage.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.707
-You did?
-It's waiting for us.

39:43.290 --> 39:46.248
"The gift of fantasy
has meant more to me

39:46.250 --> 39:49.788
"than any talent for abstract
positive thinking."

39:49.790 --> 39:51.246
Albert Einstein.

39:57.750 --> 39:59.786
Yeah, she left about an hour ago.

40:01.170 --> 40:02.489
Oh, uh...

40:02.500 --> 40:06.163
So apparently Henry's favorite
zoo animals were the pigeons.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.666
I know, right?

40:10.420 --> 40:14.117
Anyway, you know, my mom,
she drives me crazy,

40:14.120 --> 40:15.451
but she means well.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.532
You know, I was thinking about it.

40:18.540 --> 40:22.453
I lost a sister, but my mom and dad,
they lost a child.

40:24.620 --> 40:25.951
Yeah.

40:27.170 --> 40:29.661
So, um, how much longer
do you think you're gonna be?

40:30.960 --> 40:32.109
Oh!

40:32.120 --> 40:35.999
Okay, good, well, I will stretch out
this glass of wine and wait up for you.

40:37.380 --> 40:38.699
Okay. Drive safe.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.075
Mommy.

41:05.710 --> 41:09.282
Hi. Hey, buddy, I didn't hear you.
You can't sleep?

41:10.580 --> 41:11.615
Oh...

41:12.120 --> 41:14.076
Can you read me a story?

41:15.920 --> 41:16.955
Um...

41:18.040 --> 41:22.033
Hey. How about I tell you a story tonight?

41:22.040 --> 41:23.951
A brand-new one? Okay.

41:24.380 --> 41:26.200
Come here.

41:30.380 --> 41:31.415
Hmm.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.206
Come here, buddy.

41:36.830 --> 41:41.665
This story is about two sisters
who loved each other very much.

41:43.540 --> 41:45.246
They lived together on a farm

41:45.250 --> 41:49.038
out in the countryside
with lots of animals.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.246
Pigeons?

41:50.250 --> 41:52.662
Um, especially pigeons.
How did you know that?

41:54.750 --> 41:58.413
In the winter, when it snowed,

41:58.420 --> 42:02.538
the two sisters would pretend
that they lived in a huge castle.

42:04.880 --> 42:08.281
They would spend long, wonderful days

42:08.290 --> 42:11.282
talking about what
they were going to do in the future.

42:13.620 --> 42:18.614
They made a vow that
if ever they were apart,

42:18.620 --> 42:23.819
they would go outside at night
when the moon was full

42:23.830 --> 42:26.242
and look up into the slq...

42:29.830 --> 42:33.414
And they knew that they would
both be looking at the same thing...

42:35.960 --> 42:38.201
And that they would never be apart.
