WEBVTT

00:01.990 --> 00:06.989
Previously on "big
brother", Vanessa had

00:06.990 --> 00:09.989
secured herself two
different alliances.

00:09.990 --> 00:12.989
There was Austin's angels on
one side, and Johnnie mack

00:12.990 --> 00:16.989
and Steve on the other.

00:16.990 --> 00:18.989
With sneaky Steve in power...

00:18.990 --> 00:20.989
Steve, you are the new
head of household!

00:20.990 --> 00:21.950
Steve!

00:21.951 --> 00:26.989
He took a shot at Liz.

00:26.990 --> 00:30.989
I have nominated you
Austin and Liz for eviction.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.989
But after Austin has won
the veto,.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.989
I have decided to use the
power of veto to save

00:36.990 --> 00:36.991
myself.

00:36.991 --> 00:38.989
Julia, I'm so sorry.

00:38.990 --> 00:41.409
Steve put the sisters
side-by-side.

00:41.410 --> 00:43.539
Bye-bye Liz and Julia,
nice knowing you, twin twist

00:43.540 --> 00:45.699
is over, see you in jury.

00:45.700 --> 00:50.989
At first it seemed like
Liz was the obvious target.

00:50.990 --> 00:51.990
Liz can beat pea.

00:51.991 --> 00:56.989
But after Julia decided
that Liz could see fight to

00:56.990 --> 00:57.990
another day.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.989
You should, you got this.

00:59.990 --> 01:02.989
A deal was struck with
Vanessa to keep her in the

01:02.990 --> 01:04.989
game.

01:04.990 --> 01:07.989
If I get the hoh, I
expect the other two to be

01:07.990 --> 01:10.989
out the front door.

01:10.990 --> 01:16.989
At the live eviction,
the house said bye-bye to ju-ju.

01:16.990 --> 01:21.829
By a vote of 3-0, Julia,
you are evicted from the big

01:21.830 --> 01:24.539
brother house.

01:24.540 --> 01:30.989
With only five remaining
and egg-sit, battle for

01:30.990 --> 01:31.990
power began.

01:31.991 --> 01:34.989
Tonight who will secure
their spot in the final four

01:34.990 --> 01:36.989
and which two house guests
will be nominated for

01:36.990 --> 01:37.990
eviction.

01:37.991 --> 01:40.989
Plus frackie returns and
takes two house guests on

01:40.990 --> 01:44.989
the trip of a lifetime, all
this right now on "big

01:44.990 --> 01:49.290
brother"

02:25.950 --> 02:26.950
> is everybody ready?

02:26.950 --> 02:26.990
Yes.

02:26.990 --> 02:26.991
Great.

02:26.991 --> 02:34.991
Because this competition
begins now.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.989
The object of this head
of household competition is

02:39.990 --> 02:42.989
to get our eggs one at a
time across the rainbow to

02:42.990 --> 02:44.989
the pot of gold.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.989
The first house guest to
transfer all ten eggs

02:46.990 --> 02:50.999
without them falling wins
the head of household.

02:51.000 --> 02:51.990
Oh God.

02:51.991 --> 02:55.989
In addition to going for
hoh, we can also go for a

02:55.990 --> 02:58.989
luxury prize for a once in a
lifetime trip outside the

02:58.990 --> 03:04.989
Big Brother house.

03:04.990 --> 03:06.989
Ju-ju my other half has
just been evicted from the

03:06.990 --> 03:09.989
"Big Brother" house and I'm
fired up.

03:09.990 --> 03:13.949
I'm hoping to go, have me or
Austin win this hoh

03:13.950 --> 03:13.990
competition.

03:13.991 --> 03:19.949
I'm definitely wanting to
get revenge on little

03:19.950 --> 03:20.989
Mr. sneaky Steve.

03:20.990 --> 03:28.989
Not so lucky.

03:28.990 --> 03:31.949
The outgoing hoh, I can't
compete so I'm hoping

03:31.950 --> 03:36.989
Vanessa or John can win hoh
this week, protect me.

03:36.990 --> 03:39.699
Pie worst-case scenario
would be either Austin or

03:39.700 --> 03:40.989
Liz can win after them.

03:40.990 --> 03:43.989
I'm the hoh that went after
Julia and I know they'll

03:43.990 --> 03:48.989
come after me if I don't win.

03:48.990 --> 03:51.829
Liz and... Julia just left
so Liz and ri the show-man's

03:51.830 --> 03:51.990
couple.

03:51.991 --> 03:56.949
So we need to win this to
insurance we're in the final

03:56.950 --> 04:01.289
four.

04:01.290 --> 04:04.989
Austin gets his first egg.

04:04.990 --> 04:07.829
We have five people left
this is the most important

04:07.830 --> 04:08.989
hoh we've had thus far.

04:08.990 --> 04:11.989
At this point I need to win
this thing.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.989
My strategy is trying to
roll it and catch it if my

04:14.990 --> 04:19.989
other hand all the way down
the other side.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.989
Johnny mack with his first egg.

04:22.990 --> 04:23.990
Yes, sir.

04:23.990 --> 04:23.991
All right.

04:23.991 --> 04:27.119
This would be a great
time to get some blood on my

04:27.120 --> 04:28.989
hands and make a big move.

04:28.990 --> 04:33.999
And I want to get a big
target out of this game.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.989
Okay, got one.

04:35.990 --> 04:43.990
Vanessa gets her first egg.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.989
I want a golden goose, daddy.

04:54.990 --> 04:55.990
Austin gets his second egg.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.989
I see Austin just
cruising over the rainbow.

04:58.990 --> 05:00.989
I'll just thinking oh, man!

05:00.990 --> 05:02.989
I don't want to you win, dude.

05:02.990 --> 05:04.949
I'm going to end up on the
block.

05:04.950 --> 05:08.989
Slow down, mess up.

05:08.990 --> 05:12.539
It is a really miserable
experience watching Austin

05:12.540 --> 05:14.989
take this lead an sitting
here and there not a thing I

05:14.990 --> 05:15.990
can do about it.

05:15.991 --> 05:18.989
I could really use a
four-leaf clover, because if

05:18.990 --> 05:22.989
Austin wins I'm not in a
good spot.

05:22.990 --> 05:29.989
Vanessa gets her second egg.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.409
Vanessa, Johnnie mack an
Austin are tied for the

05:32.410 --> 05:33.989
league with two eggs, Liz is
bringing up the rear with

05:33.990 --> 05:34.990
her first, almost done.

05:34.991 --> 05:38.989
This competition is so
much harder than it looks.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.289
I'm just trying to go slow
and steady so I can win the

05:41.290 --> 05:46.989
race and by race I mean not
drop my egg.

05:46.990 --> 05:52.989
Lizes get her first egg.

05:52.990 --> 05:56.989
John ties Vanessa and
Austin for the lead with

05:56.990 --> 06:01.989
three eggs.

06:01.990 --> 06:03.989
> This competition is
brutal, dropping one of your

06:03.990 --> 06:07.989
eggs is devastating because
it takes so long to bring it

06:07.990 --> 06:09.989
up to the top of the rainbow.

06:09.990 --> 06:13.989
This whole rainbow sucks.

06:13.990 --> 06:18.989
Liz dropped her egg.

06:18.990 --> 06:20.989
Awe Liz dropped another egg.

06:20.990 --> 06:23.989
She is dropping more eggs
than getting to the other

06:23.990 --> 06:24.700
size.

06:24.701 --> 06:26.829
And to watch her fail this
competition is really

06:26.830 --> 06:28.989
beautiful.

06:28.990 --> 06:35.989
A lot of gold falling on
this rainbow.

06:35.990 --> 06:41.989
Vanessa takes the lead
with her fourth egg.

06:41.990 --> 06:49.949
Liz finishes her second egg.

06:49.950 --> 06:51.829
You're on the underside
of the rainbow which means

06:51.830 --> 06:53.989
your arms are always above
your head and in doing that

06:53.990 --> 06:55.999
you are putting a lot of
strain on your shoulders.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.989
All I know is that I
probably can't lift up my

07:00.990 --> 07:04.539
coffee cup tomorrow.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.119
John pockets his fourth egg.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.989
John has four eggs,
Austin has three and Liz

07:09.990 --> 07:16.989
only has two.

07:16.990 --> 07:19.989
Within this competition
although it looks nice and

07:19.990 --> 07:20.990
cute is grueling.

07:20.991 --> 07:23.989
I'm trying to get my egg
through this little chicken

07:23.990 --> 07:23.991
wire.

07:23.991 --> 07:25.989
My fingers are getting
scratched.

07:25.990 --> 07:28.989
My arms start to give out
but I'm thinking about swrulia.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.989
I'm thinking about how much
this would mean to her to be

07:31.990 --> 07:37.989
here as well and I know I
got to do it for her.

07:37.990 --> 07:42.989
> Liz just finished her
third eck.

07:42.990 --> 07:45.989
Vanessa finishes herivity egg.

07:45.990 --> 07:50.989
Vanessa is halfway there.

07:50.990 --> 07:53.989
Austin finishes his fourth egg.

07:53.990 --> 07:56.989
John and Vanessa are tied
for the lead with five eggs

07:56.990 --> 07:57.700
each.

07:57.701 --> 08:01.989
This is quite the egg
sighting... egg-sitting

08:01.990 --> 08:01.991
matchup.

08:01.991 --> 08:02.990
I don't get it.

08:02.991 --> 08:05.989
Oh, God.

08:05.990 --> 08:07.990
Vanessa is in the lead
with six eggs.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.989
Going for the luxury prize.

08:16.990 --> 08:19.989
I'm really struggling
over here, Austin is doing

08:19.990 --> 08:20.120
great.

08:20.121 --> 08:23.989
I'm banking on him to win
but I know that this is just

08:23.990 --> 08:30.989
not my comp and I'm going to
go for that luxury prize.

08:30.990 --> 08:32.989
I'm trailing too far behind.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.999
I'm taking the luxury with me.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.989
Liz has officially won
the luxury prize and will be

08:37.990 --> 08:41.989
taking a trip outside of the
Big Brother house.

08:41.990 --> 08:43.989
Did you go for the luxury.

08:43.990 --> 08:44.000
Yeah.

08:44.001 --> 08:47.989
As usual, Liz adds
pressure to my already

08:47.990 --> 08:48.990
pressurized game situation.

08:48.991 --> 08:50.989
Now it's all on my shoulders.

08:50.990 --> 08:54.949
If I can win it, Liz and I,
we're going to be in the

08:54.950 --> 08:55.120
final four.

08:55.121 --> 08:59.289
I only have three eggs,
there's no way.

08:59.290 --> 09:04.989
An Vanessa maintains her
lead with her seventh egg.

09:04.990 --> 09:11.539
Austin finishes his sixth egg.

09:11.540 --> 09:12.989
Johnny mack finishes his
seventh egg.

09:12.990 --> 09:15.989
I have not won a single
hoh in this game.

09:15.990 --> 09:19.989
My resume looks pretty bad
on paper.

09:19.990 --> 09:23.119
So this with be a great time
for me to win this hoh, cuz

09:23.120 --> 09:27.119
I've done something.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.409
Austin completes his 7th egg.

09:29.410 --> 09:33.699
Good job, aust irx.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.409
Vanessa maintains her
lead with her 8th egg.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.989
General and Austin are tid
for second with seven.

09:39.990 --> 09:42.989
If Austin wins this, oom's
in a really bad spot because

09:42.990 --> 09:44.119
I really want to see the
show-mance back on the block

09:44.120 --> 09:45.120
this week.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.989
Johnnie mack completes his 8th.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.699
I've got the lead but to
the by much.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.989
It's like I can taste final
four.

09:56.990 --> 09:57.990
I've got a shot at this.

09:57.990 --> 09:58.990
Stay focused.

09:58.991 --> 10:01.999
Everybody will come down to
whether I drop an egg at

10:02.000 --> 10:03.289
this point.

10:03.290 --> 10:11.290
Vanessa with will eggs
Vanessa drops an egg.

10:13.990 --> 10:17.989
Liz drops another egg.

10:17.990 --> 10:22.989
Austin completing his 8th egg.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.989
It's down to pretty much
myself, Vanessa and fun and

10:25.990 --> 10:28.539
it's a close race to the
finish and all I'm thinking

10:28.540 --> 10:30.989
is focus on myself, keep going.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.989
We're so close to making it
to the end.

10:32.990 --> 10:36.829
Let's do this.

10:36.830 --> 10:44.539
Austin with a big drop.

10:44.540 --> 10:44.990
Bam.

10:44.991 --> 10:47.989
Vanessa completes her 9th egg.

10:47.990 --> 10:50.119
She is on her final egg.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.829
Down to the wire.

10:51.830 --> 10:54.989
It's me and Johnnie mack and
I'm thinking you know what,

10:54.990 --> 10:56.539
I'm no one's top priority.

10:56.540 --> 10:58.289
I'm everyone's replacement
nominee this week.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.570
I really need to win this thing.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.121
Vanessa is on her final egg.

11:09.290 --> 11:14.989
John and Austin are tied
with eight eggs.

11:14.990 --> 11:16.989
Johnnie mack with his 9th egg.

11:16.990 --> 11:20.119
Vanessa and John have only
one to go.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.989
Whoever wins it will be the
new hoh an guarantees

11:23.990 --> 11:26.119
themselves a spot in the
final four.

11:26.120 --> 11:30.989
Between me and Vanessa,
my hands are bleeingdz,

11:30.990 --> 11:31.990
feeling the pain in pie
shoulders.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.999
All it takes is Vanessa to
make one false move with the

11:35.000 --> 11:43.000
egg and I can take the hoh
for myself.

11:59.990 --> 12:02.949
Vanessa gets her 10th egg
which means congratulations,

12:02.950 --> 12:05.949
Vanessa, you are the new
head of household.

12:05.950 --> 12:06.989
Oh my gosh, you guys u
don't have to hug me, I'm so

12:06.990 --> 12:06.991
disgusting.

12:06.991 --> 12:10.989
I can't even move my arms.

12:10.990 --> 12:13.989
So I win hoh and although
I'm secure for the we can,

12:13.990 --> 12:16.289
I'm now sitting in the
middle of two alliances.

12:16.290 --> 12:18.989
I've got Liz and Austin on
one side and Steve and

12:18.990 --> 12:19.990
Johnnie mack on the other.

12:19.991 --> 12:21.989
And it's time for me to
choose a side.

12:21.990 --> 12:22.990
Well done.

12:22.990 --> 12:23.990
Thats with a toughie.

12:23.991 --> 12:26.989
When Vanessa wins it
means that the show-mance

12:26.990 --> 12:28.949
will be targeted this week.

12:28.950 --> 12:30.989
I stay for the week and holy
crap, I did just make final

12:30.990 --> 12:31.990
four?

12:31.991 --> 12:34.989
I was like I'm trailing
behind so far, the least coy

12:34.990 --> 12:37.989
do is get a luxury for may
damn self.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.989
Vanessa has kind of
sketched me out lately.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.949
I kind of feel like she's
playing both sides of the

12:42.950 --> 12:42.990
house.

12:42.991 --> 12:44.990
And who knows what she's
capable of doing.

12:55.990 --> 12:56.990
> Oh my goodness.

12:56.991 --> 12:58.289
Oh man.

12:58.290 --> 12:59.989
That was a lot harder
than it looked.

12:59.990 --> 13:00.990
I will say.

13:00.991 --> 13:02.989
My arms hurt so bad, Steve.

13:02.990 --> 13:06.289
I believe it, I believe it.

13:06.290 --> 13:10.539
I feel really good about
Vanessa winning because the

13:10.540 --> 13:16.989
plan with me was to check
out... take occupant the

13:16.990 --> 13:18.949
remaining show-mance.

13:18.950 --> 13:21.989
She just can't get paranoid
with Steve and myself

13:21.990 --> 13:25.989
because if she does, we're
in trouble.

13:25.990 --> 13:28.989
Give me a hug.

13:28.990 --> 13:29.120
Thank you.

13:29.121 --> 13:32.699
Give me a hug.

13:32.700 --> 13:35.119
Vanessa winning head of
household means that she

13:35.120 --> 13:39.989
could very well think of me
as a threat since I'm the

13:39.990 --> 13:40.990
last girl standing with her.

13:40.991 --> 13:42.409
But she likes girls.

13:42.410 --> 13:42.990
I'm a girl.

13:42.991 --> 13:46.829
I hope she still likes me.

13:46.830 --> 13:47.989
I'll get over it.

13:47.990 --> 13:48.990
Great job.

13:48.990 --> 13:48.998
Thank you.

13:48.999 --> 13:49.990
Yeah.

13:49.991 --> 13:54.989
I don't have it... in me.

13:54.990 --> 13:55.990
I know I saw it.

13:55.991 --> 13:58.989
You know what, I have too
much paranoia on my mind,

13:58.990 --> 14:00.989
way too much stuff going on.

14:00.990 --> 14:04.989
So step one for me now
that I'm hoh is going to be

14:04.990 --> 14:07.989
ask Steve, ask Austin, ask
Liz what deals did you guys

14:07.990 --> 14:10.989
have coming into this hoh
and start comparing notes

14:10.990 --> 14:14.989
and see who is lying to me,
who is telling the truth.

14:14.990 --> 14:17.989
What did Steve think you
were going to do if you won?

14:17.990 --> 14:21.989
That I would keep him safe.

14:21.990 --> 14:22.990
That's what I thought.

14:22.991 --> 14:26.539
That is what I said, to
keep him in line.

14:26.540 --> 14:27.989
Here we go again.

14:27.990 --> 14:30.989
Vanessa is looking for a
reason for who to put up

14:30.990 --> 14:30.991
this week.

14:30.991 --> 14:33.989
And it's because her
paranoia is getting the best

14:33.990 --> 14:34.990
of her.

14:34.991 --> 14:37.989
Her wheels are spinning in
her head but she's got to

14:37.990 --> 14:44.989
remember, myself and Liz,
we're her alliance.

14:44.990 --> 14:46.989
Will you answer me
something real quick, Steve.

14:46.990 --> 14:47.990
Sure.

14:47.991 --> 14:50.989
I'm just on one big quest
for information, because

14:50.990 --> 14:52.989
information in this game is
power.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.289
And more so than that, it's
also just a vacation and I

14:55.290 --> 14:58.539
need a justification to put
two people on the block this

14:58.540 --> 15:00.989
week.

15:00.990 --> 15:01.990
Go ahead of me.

15:01.990 --> 15:02.830
Okay.

15:02.831 --> 15:07.989
What did you think Austin
was going to do if he won

15:07.990 --> 15:09.989
hoh.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.949
Some combination of me,
you, Johnnie.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.989
Do you have no other
specific information?

15:13.990 --> 15:14.990
Do I?

15:14.990 --> 15:15.990
Think really carefully.

15:15.991 --> 15:20.989
It is going to come down to
it right now.

15:20.990 --> 15:23.989
My Austin guess of who
Austin would put up.

15:23.990 --> 15:24.990
I didn't want a guess.

15:24.990 --> 15:25.990
Did he tell new.

15:25.991 --> 15:28.989
He did not tell me who he
would put up.

15:28.990 --> 15:29.990
De say he would keep you safe.

15:29.990 --> 15:30.990
Yes.

15:30.991 --> 15:32.119
He did.

15:32.120 --> 15:32.990
Yes.

15:32.991 --> 15:35.409
Did he say its with a
front door or back door.

15:35.410 --> 15:38.989
No, he just said I'm not
his target.

15:38.990 --> 15:38.991
Okay.

15:38.991 --> 15:42.989
And who did you think was
going on the block.

15:42.990 --> 15:46.999
She told me she would put
me on the block.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.989
I want to tell you this
now because I don't want to

15:49.990 --> 15:51.989
think anything misconstrued.

15:51.990 --> 15:54.989
I made a deal with Liz where
I would give her an her

15:54.990 --> 15:56.989
sister what they want...
>> right before the live

15:56.990 --> 15:59.989
show I made a deal with Liz
because I know they really

15:59.990 --> 16:01.989
wanted Liz to stay over Julia.

16:01.990 --> 16:04.989
I would like to ask, if you
win hoh and I'm on the

16:04.990 --> 16:04.991
block.

16:04.991 --> 16:05.990
Okay.

16:05.991 --> 16:07.989
And you end up being the
tie breaker.

16:07.990 --> 16:07.991
Yes.

16:07.991 --> 16:10.289
Could you break it in my favor.

16:10.290 --> 16:10.990
Yes.

16:10.991 --> 16:13.989
Vanessa, of course I'm
going to try to pull a deal

16:13.990 --> 16:14.000
out of Liz.

16:14.001 --> 16:16.989
Would you do the same thing
and you would be a hypocrite

16:16.990 --> 16:17.990
to say you're not okay with
what I did.

16:17.991 --> 16:19.989
Okay, okay, I understand.

16:19.990 --> 16:22.119
Cool.

16:22.120 --> 16:22.990
Now you scared me.

16:22.991 --> 16:25.989
Good to know, Steve what
that means is she just made

16:25.990 --> 16:26.990
a deal to send me home.

16:26.991 --> 16:34.991
At this point, I have no
idea what I'm going to do.

16:44.990 --> 16:46.989
You... they are just
adding up for me.

16:46.990 --> 16:46.991
Okay.

16:46.991 --> 16:50.989
More than anything I'm
actually up set with Liz.

16:50.990 --> 16:51.540
Really?

16:51.541 --> 16:55.989
She gave me her word on
her sister that she wouldn't

16:55.990 --> 16:57.829
vote against me.

16:57.830 --> 17:00.989
And she promised Steve the
same thing.

17:00.990 --> 17:03.989
She was going to go back
on it she never meant to

17:03.990 --> 17:05.999
keep it I just wanted
to... say whatever you're

17:06.000 --> 17:06.990
going to say.

17:06.991 --> 17:09.289
Who did Johnnie think you
were going to put up?

17:09.290 --> 17:12.989
I just told him that if I
can I will take him to final

17:12.990 --> 17:15.989
four like we talked about.

17:15.990 --> 17:17.989
You took Steve, so how
did that work.

17:17.990 --> 17:20.409
They're both... I was just
telling them that.

17:20.410 --> 17:22.119
I wasn't going to keep
either one of them safe.

17:22.120 --> 17:27.409
I was going to put up both
of them.

17:27.410 --> 17:29.989
I had to say what I had to
say to make sure...

17:29.990 --> 17:32.409
I understand, everyone
has to say what they have to

17:32.410 --> 17:34.989
say but everyone is just
saying what they have to

17:34.990 --> 17:34.991
say.

17:34.991 --> 17:35.990
Okay.

17:35.991 --> 17:39.699
That's the issue.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.989
I don't be mad at me
again, please.

17:41.990 --> 17:42.000
No.

17:42.001 --> 17:47.989
I can't go against you.

17:47.990 --> 17:51.989
My... I feel like there's
something shady going on.

17:51.990 --> 17:54.989
No way.

17:54.990 --> 18:02.990
Seriously.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.989
Apparently there were all
these deals going on where

18:06.990 --> 18:07.990
potentially I was going on
the block.

18:07.991 --> 18:10.989
Might as well fill may self
in completely and find out

18:10.990 --> 18:12.539
what people were telling
Johnnie mack and see if I

18:12.540 --> 18:13.989
can get any more information.

18:13.990 --> 18:14.990
Will you answer me a question?

18:14.990 --> 18:14.991
Yeah.

18:14.991 --> 18:17.989
Had you ever talked in
the last few days either

18:17.990 --> 18:20.699
Austin or Liz what they were
going to do if they won?

18:20.700 --> 18:25.989
Austin said he wouldn't
put me up.

18:25.990 --> 18:26.990
Without did he say.

18:26.991 --> 18:29.989
He told me to make a deal
I went and made a deal with

18:29.990 --> 18:32.119
him that I would put you an
Steve up.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.989
Okay, so you're saying
was it your idea or his

18:34.990 --> 18:35.120
idea.

18:35.121 --> 18:36.989
You told me to.

18:36.990 --> 18:37.990
I did?

18:37.990 --> 18:38.290
I don't remember.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.409
You told me I had to go
page a deal with Austin.

18:41.410 --> 18:43.989
You think it's smart to
have a deal with Austin for

18:43.990 --> 18:45.949
to us make a deal with him.

18:45.950 --> 18:46.989
And pockly break it, yes.

18:46.990 --> 18:47.990
Maybe.

18:47.991 --> 18:49.289
See what I'm saying.

18:49.290 --> 18:50.949
No, I agree.

18:50.950 --> 18:52.989
Why what I want to you
make a deal that includes

18:52.990 --> 18:53.990
putting me on the block.

18:53.991 --> 18:55.989
I wouldn't... I didn't ask
you that.

18:55.990 --> 18:56.950
Okay.

18:56.951 --> 18:57.989
Like Vanessa, are you crazy.

18:57.990 --> 19:01.989
Don't you remember that you
told me to make this deal?

19:01.990 --> 19:05.989
Well like to hide our
alliance this is typical you,

19:05.990 --> 19:13.990
Vanessa.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.989
> How is your... during
that.

19:18.990 --> 19:19.990
Okay, fine.

19:19.991 --> 19:21.949
What is the deal with her.

19:21.950 --> 19:27.989
She's mash ash... the deal
with Steve, he said Steve

19:27.990 --> 19:28.990
made me do it.

19:44.700 --> 19:45.989
Can I talk to you?

19:45.990 --> 19:53.990
Sure.

19:54.990 --> 19:57.989
You are bugging out.

19:57.990 --> 20:01.539
I what be too.

20:01.540 --> 20:04.989
Look, he came up like I'm
just really scared leaving

20:04.990 --> 20:07.989
new the game and obviously I
said anything I could.

20:07.990 --> 20:10.539
If I won hoh I would have
never put you up.

20:10.540 --> 20:18.540
I would have...
>> you need a replacement of

20:19.990 --> 20:22.989
me, of course you put me and
if you want... you need the

20:22.990 --> 20:24.989
tie breaker vote to keep him.

20:24.990 --> 20:29.989
I would never have done
that, though.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.989
I have never given you a
reason to doubt me.

20:31.990 --> 20:36.989
I took out James, your
arch-enemy, I don't know

20:36.990 --> 20:37.990
what I want to you tell me.

20:37.990 --> 20:38.990
Okay.

20:38.991 --> 20:41.699
I've been dealing with
Vanessa an her paranoia all

20:41.700 --> 20:41.990
summer long.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.989
Another day in the big
brother house.

20:43.990 --> 20:46.989
When Vanessa is paranoid,
she knows how to interrogate

20:46.990 --> 20:47.990
everyone.

20:47.991 --> 20:50.989
It's essential that I calm
Vanessa down so she doesn't

20:50.990 --> 20:53.989
jump to the wrong conclusion
and end up putting myself

20:53.990 --> 20:54.990
and Liz on the block.

20:54.990 --> 20:55.990
That would ruin everything.

20:55.991 --> 21:00.989
Look, Vanessa...
>> elite reallyly said I'm

21:00.990 --> 21:01.990
controlling the vote.

21:01.991 --> 21:03.989
If you don't tell me what I
want to hear I'm going to

21:03.990 --> 21:05.989
tell them to vote you out.

21:05.990 --> 21:06.990
So please don't question that.

21:06.991 --> 21:09.539
I believe you, I believe you.

21:09.540 --> 21:12.989
Liz, I believe you.

21:12.990 --> 21:15.989
They already put me in
this situation by making me

21:15.990 --> 21:17.989
swear...
>> I understand.

21:17.990 --> 21:19.989
Are they talking to her?

21:19.990 --> 21:25.829
They're talking... they're
talking... did to the go in

21:25.830 --> 21:27.989
there do not go in there.

21:27.990 --> 21:29.989
Whoever won the veto,
whoever beat Johnnie mack

21:29.990 --> 21:32.989
and I end up with a decision
on me, you have two

21:32.990 --> 21:33.700
conflicting promises there.

21:33.701 --> 21:34.829
No, I don't.

21:34.830 --> 21:36.989
You promised Steve if it
came down to your tie

21:36.990 --> 21:38.829
breaker vote you would keep him.

21:38.830 --> 21:39.989
Hi no intention of keeping it.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.289
What was I going to say.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.989
I never meant to say...
>> I never made a deal, I

21:43.990 --> 21:46.989
said yeah, buddy, I got you.

21:46.990 --> 21:49.989
Don't worry opinions but you
told me Johnnie mack you

21:49.990 --> 21:52.989
never talked to about it.

21:52.990 --> 21:55.989
I never talked to
Johnny... Johnnie mack about

21:55.990 --> 21:56.700
nominations.

21:56.701 --> 21:57.989
He just told me
completely different.

21:57.990 --> 21:59.989
That's a... lie.

21:59.990 --> 22:01.989
My name never came out of
his mouth.

22:01.990 --> 22:02.120
His mouth?

22:02.121 --> 22:05.409
No.

22:05.410 --> 22:07.999
That's going to start
factoring all my decisions

22:08.000 --> 22:12.989
now, who I can't beat if I
go to the end with them.

22:12.990 --> 22:19.989
I feel like...
>> tough to make it without

22:19.990 --> 22:20.990
a lawyer.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.989
It's going to be tough to
beat him.

22:23.990 --> 22:26.989
I probably can't beat my
girlfriend either, honestly.

22:26.990 --> 22:29.829
So I think I would be
secretary place.

22:29.830 --> 22:37.830
I'm feeling... I got more
figured out.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.829
Just get there.

22:40.830 --> 22:42.989
I'm down, why even ris tk.

22:42.990 --> 22:45.119
He told me would put me
and Steve up.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.989
He never said that he
never told me that.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.989
He said that you said the
same thing.

22:48.990 --> 22:51.989
I never said names to him.

22:51.990 --> 22:53.999
Like I've been committed
to you and you and that's it

22:54.000 --> 22:56.949
I don't trust what Johnnie
mack and Steve are going to

22:56.950 --> 22:56.990
do.

22:56.991 --> 22:59.989
I can't have them both here
to final four because they

22:59.990 --> 23:00.990
will take each other to
final three.

23:00.991 --> 23:02.119
I have never been committed
to anything they have ever

23:02.120 --> 23:02.990
said to me.

23:02.991 --> 23:05.119
So I can't believe he said
those names came out of my

23:05.120 --> 23:06.949
mouth, they did not.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.949
I'm Judas I'm willing to
say whatever I need to say

23:09.950 --> 23:12.539
to anyone in order to stay
safe for another week in

23:12.540 --> 23:12.990
this house.

23:12.991 --> 23:16.539
I'm going to go with my
gut, and just go with pie

23:16.540 --> 23:18.540
gut and that's that ♪

23:27.990 --> 23:32.989
Be a fly on the wall
inside the Big Brother house

23:32.990 --> 23:35.271
watch the houseguests anytime on
the live feeds on CBS.Com

23:46.990 --> 23:47.990
okay.

23:47.990 --> 23:48.990
Hi there.

23:48.990 --> 23:49.990
Close the door.

23:49.991 --> 23:52.949
All right, so here's
where my head is at.

23:52.950 --> 23:56.289
I know the obvious play is
to go for Austin and Liz.

23:56.290 --> 23:56.990
Okay.

23:56.991 --> 23:58.989
Because they are a couple.

23:58.990 --> 23:58.991
Okay.

23:58.991 --> 24:01.989
And I think I'm foolish
to think you're ever going

24:01.990 --> 24:03.989
to take me to finals over
Johnnie.

24:03.990 --> 24:06.699
You'd be foolish to do that
do the math.

24:06.700 --> 24:09.409
He hasn't won an hoh, I've
won four.

24:09.410 --> 24:10.989
So come on.

24:10.990 --> 24:12.989
Incentive wise...
>> you think I would have an

24:12.990 --> 24:14.829
easier time beating Johnnie
than you.

24:14.830 --> 24:14.990
Yes.

24:14.990 --> 24:15.990
Okay.

24:15.991 --> 24:17.989
He's already been evicted
from the game.

24:17.990 --> 24:22.289
Ands aliked as he is in jury,
I think that he hasn't won

24:22.290 --> 24:23.000
an hoh.

24:23.001 --> 24:24.989
And I needed to by now.

24:24.990 --> 24:26.989
And he's a very loyal guy.

24:26.990 --> 24:30.539
And he's also a guy's guy.

24:30.540 --> 24:30.990
You're afraid of him.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.989
And I've also worked with
him the shortest of anyone.

24:32.990 --> 24:33.990
Okay.

24:33.991 --> 24:35.989
And all those factors
makes me believe he's going

24:35.990 --> 24:38.409
to take you and you're going
to take him, so I might as

24:38.410 --> 24:39.989
well be in the house with
oooh too sho-mances that are

24:39.990 --> 24:40.999
incentivized to take each
other to the finals.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.539
The only thing I can do ask
to make smart joyces by

24:44.540 --> 24:45.989
increasing my odds of
getting the final.

24:45.990 --> 24:46.990
Okay.

24:46.991 --> 24:49.989
What is standing in my
way, first getting to final

24:49.989 --> 24:51.989
What is standing in my way
is having people choose me

24:51.990 --> 24:55.989
and people with lower
competition wins are much

24:55.990 --> 25:01.989
more attractive than people
like me.

25:01.990 --> 25:04.989
It's like all of us have
done a lot and then Johnnie

25:04.990 --> 25:05.990
is like out here.

25:05.991 --> 25:07.989
He has not won an hoh, light.

25:07.990 --> 25:09.989
He's the easy one to pull
along because he's very

25:09.990 --> 25:12.989
unlikely to win and it's the
smartest play for me to go

25:12.990 --> 25:15.409
for Johnnie mack, after
thinking it all through,

25:15.410 --> 25:15.990
that's it.

25:15.991 --> 25:18.949
I just think that is the
more risky option.

25:18.950 --> 25:18.990
For you.

25:18.991 --> 25:19.990
For you.

25:19.990 --> 25:20.990
For both of us.

25:20.991 --> 25:23.989
There is a tremendous
amount of risk... risk for me

25:23.990 --> 25:24.990
no matter what.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.989
I just think there is a
numbers advantage and we're

25:27.990 --> 25:30.989
losing to now whans what
numbers advantage, you had a

25:30.990 --> 25:31.000
numbers advantage.

25:31.001 --> 25:32.989
We had a numbers advantage.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.989
No, there is no we with
the Johnnie.

25:34.990 --> 25:37.989
Johnnie and I are on the
same side to break up the

25:37.990 --> 25:38.000
three some.

25:38.001 --> 25:39.409
The three some is broken up.

25:39.410 --> 25:41.989
I don't believe I have an
alliance with Johnnie mack.

25:41.990 --> 25:41.991
Okay.

25:41.991 --> 25:43.989
Dow understand the
difference, that's the

25:43.990 --> 25:44.990
difference.

25:44.991 --> 25:46.119
If you went to final
three with us.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.989
I'm sure he does.

25:47.990 --> 25:48.990
Vanessa what are you doing?

25:48.991 --> 25:51.989
The whole point of my hoh
last week was to get us a

25:51.990 --> 25:54.989
numbers advantage so it was
3 on 2 going into final five,

25:54.990 --> 25:56.989
that the was the function of
my hoh.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.829
If you go against Johnnie
mackin stead of 3 on 1rk it

25:59.830 --> 26:02.949
will be 2 on 2 and we're
right back where we started

26:02.950 --> 26:03.989
this doesn't help you at all.

26:03.990 --> 26:04.990
Go get some sleep.

26:04.990 --> 26:05.990
Give me a hug.

26:05.991 --> 26:09.989
I have to go to bed.

26:09.990 --> 26:12.699
I'm so soar from that comp, bro.

26:12.700 --> 26:17.949
I'm only 60% sure of what
I'm going to do.

26:17.950 --> 26:20.989
Okay.

26:20.990 --> 26:23.539
If I'm going to do
something as bold and risky

26:23.540 --> 26:26.989
as keeping a show-mance in
the house into final four I

26:26.990 --> 26:29.989
better be sure the things
they're telling me they will

26:29.990 --> 26:29.991
stick to.

26:29.991 --> 26:32.989
The best way is to go to
Austin, shake his hand, get

26:32.990 --> 26:35.989
his word and make a deal.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.539
I don't want to go
against you in this game

26:37.540 --> 26:40.989
even though logically this
is... I can't believe I'm

26:40.990 --> 26:41.990
having this conversation.

26:41.991 --> 26:42.999
I don't think it is.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.989
It would be amazing to
make the deal so that

26:44.990 --> 26:48.989
basically what I need is
first of all, you would be

26:48.990 --> 26:50.989
agreeing you vote the way I
want this we can.

26:50.990 --> 26:54.699
Austin and Judas will
give you his word together.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.989
Okay there will be no
squirming out of it.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.989
So the first thing is, is
that vote needs to go

26:59.990 --> 27:01.999
Johnnie mack needs to go.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.989
Second thing is, if you
win the veto,.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.699
Don't use it, obviously.

27:07.700 --> 27:07.990
Obviously.

27:07.990 --> 27:08.410
Okay.

27:08.411 --> 27:15.409
The third thing is next
week when that hoh please.

27:15.410 --> 27:17.989
I will go for it, 100 percent.

27:17.990 --> 27:18.700
That would be a I paing.

27:18.701 --> 27:21.989
Dow want me to normally
give you my word.

27:21.990 --> 27:23.989
I feel terrible to ask
anyone to do that.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.989
I will, I have no problem.

27:25.990 --> 27:27.989
You and Judas united.

27:27.990 --> 27:28.999
Austin and Judas.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.999
Are there any other
people that I need to know

27:31.000 --> 27:31.990
about.

27:31.990 --> 27:32.990
Not that I know of yet.

27:32.991 --> 27:35.989
I think it's Austin and Judas.

27:35.990 --> 27:37.989
This game is not about
who wins the most

27:37.990 --> 27:38.990
competition.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.409
It's who puts themselves in
the most strategy I believe

27:41.410 --> 27:42.989
position to advance.

27:42.990 --> 27:45.989
On day two I promised
Vanessa we would work until

27:45.990 --> 27:48.989
the end of this game together.

27:48.990 --> 27:51.699
I'm down for...
>> then I fell in love with

27:51.700 --> 27:51.990
Liz.

27:51.991 --> 27:53.999
But I have to put my own
interests first if I'm going

27:54.000 --> 27:55.989
to win this thing.

27:55.990 --> 28:00.989
Austin and Judas formally
want to let you know that we

28:00.990 --> 28:07.989
swear on my love for Liz,
and my family name on

28:07.990 --> 28:12.989
everything I hold dear that
what you've asked of me in

28:12.990 --> 28:13.990
here will be honored.

28:13.990 --> 28:14.990
All right.

28:14.990 --> 28:15.540
100 percent.

28:15.540 --> 28:15.990
Sounds good.

28:15.990 --> 28:16.990
Let me shake on that one.

28:16.991 --> 28:18.989
An I believe you on that
I do believe you.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.989
I want some of to believe
the things Austin is telling

28:21.990 --> 28:23.989
me and the deal he is
putting on the table.

28:23.990 --> 28:25.989
And he's saying all the
right things.

28:25.990 --> 28:26.990
He's shaking my hand.

28:26.991 --> 28:28.989
He's putting it on his love
for Liz.

28:28.990 --> 28:31.989
And if I can count on him
this is the best bet for me.

28:31.990 --> 28:32.990
That sounds like the plan.

28:32.991 --> 28:34.989
Okay.

28:34.990 --> 28:35.990
And get some sleep.

28:35.991 --> 28:39.989
I need new game peak form,
all right, man.

28:39.990 --> 28:40.990
Sweet.

28:44.990 --> 28:49.989
(Cheers and applause)
>> Outgoing.

28:49.990 --> 28:50.990
What?

28:50.991 --> 28:53.989
Outspoken.

28:53.990 --> 28:56.409
One of the most idz
yottic conversations.

28:56.410 --> 29:00.989
Outrage us.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.699
The search is on for the
next "Big Brother" house

29:03.700 --> 29:03.990
guests.

29:03.991 --> 29:06.989

29:06.990 --> 29:07.290

29:07.291 --> 29:10.539

to move in and compete in a

29:10.540 --> 29:12.989
three month power struggle
for a half-million dollars.

29:12.990 --> 29:16.989
Yes, yes, yes.

29:16.990 --> 29:16.991
Yes, yes, yes.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.989
of time watching him on the

and now I'm seeing him here

30:38.990 --> 30:41.699
bizarre but really cool and
it's just wow.

I'm here because one of

The fact she chose me and
stayed true to her words,

32:07.990 --> 32:08.990
her integrity is soiled.

32:08.991 --> 32:12.119
You have five minutes to
get ready, so go.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.989
Leaving the "Big Brother"
house in '86 day something

32:14.990 --> 32:17.989
mind blowing especially that
we get to go to an Arianna

32:17.990 --> 32:18.990
Grande concert.

32:18.991 --> 32:21.989

dying to see and as a hawk

32:21.990 --> 32:24.989
frack-year fan I couldn't
have asked for a better

32:24.990 --> 32:25.990
chaperone.

32:40.990 --> 32:41.990
I will see you at the
staples center tonight.

32:41.991 --> 32:45.989
If I don't recognize you,
just look for the pink hair.

32:45.990 --> 32:49.989
I'm social sighted.

32:49.990 --> 32:52.289
86 days in the house,
kind of like forgot there

32:52.290 --> 32:54.539
was even a real world out here.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.989
I'm harnessing my inner
rocker chick and I'm going

32:56.990 --> 32:59.989
to be the purple haired roxy.

32:59.990 --> 33:03.289
And I'm going to be the
sexy soccer mom.

33:03.290 --> 33:09.989
Sexy soccer mom.

33:09.990 --> 33:11.989
Oh my God.

33:11.990 --> 33:12.990
Rock star.

33:12.990 --> 33:13.990
Who is she.

33:13.990 --> 33:14.830
You look hot.

33:14.830 --> 33:15.410
Thank you.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.999
Like it's a really good look.

33:17.000 --> 33:17.990
Thank you so much.

33:17.991 --> 33:19.989
I love my transformation.

33:19.990 --> 33:20.990
Let's do this thing.

33:20.990 --> 33:21.990
Let's go.

33:21.991 --> 33:24.409
Arianna, we are coming for you.

33:24.410 --> 33:27.989
Thank you.

33:27.990 --> 33:30.989
I feel like I've won a
sweepstakes, this will be

33:30.990 --> 33:31.990
unforgetable.

33:31.990 --> 33:32.990
Oh my gosh.

33:32.991 --> 33:36.949
It's a highway, it's
mountains, it's crazy.

33:36.950 --> 33:38.699
12 more days and 's back
to this.

33:38.700 --> 33:39.989
I'm social sighted to be
heading to the staples

33:39.990 --> 33:41.989
center to see Arianna Grande.

33:41.990 --> 33:43.989
She is so cutement I
can't wait to meet her in

33:43.990 --> 33:46.409
person and beyond that I
haven't been to a concert in

33:46.410 --> 33:46.990
forever.

33:46.991 --> 33:49.989
The coolest part of all of
this is that Liz and I get a

33:49.990 --> 33:53.989
day of relaxation, freedom,
fun, and not having to worry

33:53.990 --> 33:54.990
about talking game.

33:54.991 --> 33:59.989
The boys are going to be so
jealous.

33:59.990 --> 34:00.990
That's it!

34:00.991 --> 34:02.409
There it is.

34:02.410 --> 34:06.989
Arianna Grande tonight.

34:06.990 --> 34:08.289
Oh my goodness.

34:08.290 --> 34:15.989
Oh my God you look amazing.

34:15.990 --> 34:19.989
So I have your all access
Arianna Grande passes.

34:19.990 --> 34:20.990
Let's go.

34:20.991 --> 34:22.989
Let's do it.

34:22.990 --> 34:25.829
Okay so, this is the stage.

34:25.830 --> 34:26.989
This is the money shot right
here, look.

34:26.990 --> 34:27.990
Wow.

34:27.991 --> 34:34.989
We should stop stomp,
look, how cool is this.

34:34.990 --> 34:35.990
Woo.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.289
This is hands-down a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

34:38.290 --> 34:41.989
We get to meet Arianna and
go backstage at one of her

34:41.990 --> 34:43.989
concerts this is going to be
huge.

34:43.990 --> 34:44.000
Probably over the top.

34:44.001 --> 34:46.699
I might lose my mind.

34:46.700 --> 34:47.989
Arianna.

34:47.990 --> 34:48.700
Whooo!

34:48.701 --> 34:51.989
I'm social sighted.

34:51.990 --> 34:52.990
You are disguised.

34:52.990 --> 34:53.990
Yeah.

34:53.990 --> 34:54.990
Oh my gosh.

34:54.990 --> 34:54.998
Hi.

34:54.999 --> 34:55.990
Hi.

34:55.991 --> 34:57.829
Nice to meet you.

34:57.830 --> 34:58.989
Arianna is a sweetheart.

34:58.990 --> 35:01.989
She knew who we were knew we
were in disguises that means

35:01.990 --> 35:04.989
she knows us, I'm in shock.

35:04.990 --> 35:06.989
I love you.

35:06.990 --> 35:08.989
Break a leg, Arianna.

35:08.990 --> 35:12.989
I also like... have a
great show.

35:12.990 --> 35:13.990
I love you.

35:13.990 --> 35:14.990
Huai.

35:14.990 --> 35:15.700
You're gorgeous.

35:15.701 --> 35:16.989
Have fun.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.989
Meeting Arianna was such a rush.

35:18.990 --> 35:21.989
I'm so celeb shy right now
and I'm shocked I got to

35:21.990 --> 35:23.989
meet her and touch her.

35:23.990 --> 35:26.409
She's so nice, so sweet and
I can't wait to hear her.

35:26.410 --> 35:28.999
This is really where we
will watch the show from and

35:29.000 --> 35:33.989
I have a few gifts for you
guys from the grandes.

35:33.990 --> 35:41.989
Your very own Arianna
Grande... bag.

35:41.990 --> 35:43.989
A few things in here.

35:43.990 --> 35:45.989
I have something else
really exciting to give you.

35:45.990 --> 35:49.989
This is not even out yet,

will be the first to get

35:52.990 --> 35:53.540
Yay.

35:53.541 --> 35:58.289
You can make the house
smell really pretty now.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.989
She's coming.

36:00.990 --> 36:07.539

36:15.990 --> 36:23.990

36:36.990 --> 36:39.989
I'm so happy I took
Vanessa with me, we were

36:39.990 --> 36:41.989
dancing the whole night
together am we had such a

36:41.990 --> 36:43.119
great girl's night.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.989
Although its with amazing
I'm ready to go back to the

36:45.990 --> 36:53.990
house way smile on my face
and it was the best

36:56.410 --> 37:04.410
experience.

37:06.990 --> 37:07.990
Hey boys.

37:07.991 --> 37:11.989
Without wants to see our
alter egos!

37:11.990 --> 37:12.990
What?

37:12.991 --> 37:15.949
Finally.

37:15.950 --> 37:16.989
Whoa!

37:16.990 --> 37:18.699
Oh pie God.

37:18.700 --> 37:22.699
I'm Dakota this is roxy.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.829
Liz comes back all
dressed up looking very sexy

37:23.830 --> 37:24.989
with her alter ego.

37:24.990 --> 37:28.989
Hey, Judas what do you think
of dakotah?

37:28.990 --> 37:32.989
Dakotah, new that's a
destination would I... I

37:32.990 --> 37:33.990
would love to vit.

37:33.991 --> 37:36.989
Okay so, we got to ride
in a stretch limo.

37:36.990 --> 37:39.989
Then frackie Grande gives
us a guided handheld tour

37:39.990 --> 37:41.989
and we met Arianna, hello.

37:41.990 --> 37:45.539
We go upstairs in our vip
room which overlooks the

37:45.540 --> 37:46.410
entire staples center.

37:46.411 --> 37:48.989
Then the concert starts and
from there it was a big

37:48.990 --> 37:49.000
dance party.

37:49.001 --> 37:53.539
Thank you Arianna Grande,
frackie Grande, mama Grande.

37:53.540 --> 37:53.990
Dog-year Grande.

37:53.991 --> 37:56.989
We had the time of our
life t was the most fun

37:56.990 --> 37:58.989
we've had in '86 days.

37:58.990 --> 38:03.989
And the best tour guide ever-
/chaperone, frackie.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.989
I'm sorry, boys, but you
had no business being there

38:06.990 --> 38:08.989
it was such a girl's trip.

38:08.990 --> 38:08.991
Cool.

38:08.991 --> 38:11.989
Liz, Vanessa, I'm really
happy you had a good time at

38:11.990 --> 38:13.539
the concert.

38:13.540 --> 38:15.989
But nominations are coming
up and we've got to focus

38:15.990 --> 38:16.990
right know.

38:25.990 --> 38:29.989
I decide to go up to talk
to Vanessa because I don't

38:29.990 --> 38:31.989
think that the situation is
as cut and dried as putting

38:31.990 --> 38:33.989
Austin and Liz on the block
any more.

38:33.990 --> 38:36.989
So I need to at least see
where her head is at so I

38:36.990 --> 38:38.699
knows what's going to happen.

38:38.700 --> 38:39.989
Here's where my brain is at.

38:39.990 --> 38:42.989
100 percent certain that I'm
going to put Liz and Austin

38:42.990 --> 38:43.990
up.

38:43.990 --> 38:44.990
Right.

38:44.991 --> 38:46.989
Then I started to think
about it.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.989
I feel like I have two couples.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.989
I feel like it's two couples
and me as the big fat fifth

38:51.990 --> 38:51.991
wheel.

38:51.991 --> 38:54.989
I know Steve is always going
to take you to finals over

38:54.990 --> 38:54.991
me.

38:54.991 --> 38:56.989
He would be dumb ass not to.

38:56.990 --> 38:58.989
Vanessa is telling me
that she's caught between

38:58.990 --> 39:02.409
two show-mances and the last
time I recall I have never

39:02.410 --> 39:03.290
made out with Steve.

39:03.291 --> 39:05.989
Can you tell me would you
take me to the final two

39:05.990 --> 39:07.289
over Steve.

39:07.290 --> 39:07.990
Yeah.

39:07.991 --> 39:10.989
If Steve and me and
Austin in the game who are

39:10.990 --> 39:12.949
you taking to final three.

39:12.950 --> 39:13.989
Probably get rid of Austin.

39:13.990 --> 39:17.989
Now what if Austin has
won the hoh.

39:17.990 --> 39:18.990
He's to the going to at
that point.

39:18.991 --> 39:23.409
If I have to win a mental
comp against him I'm not

39:23.410 --> 39:23.990
going to win it.

39:23.990 --> 39:24.990
The only psychology that
works on ven as... Vanessa is

39:24.991 --> 39:28.699
reverse, reverse, reverse,
reverse psychology.

39:28.700 --> 39:28.990
Put Steve and me up.

39:28.991 --> 39:35.949
I don't want to.

39:35.950 --> 39:37.989
It's going to sart this
weird cycle and her gears

39:37.990 --> 39:40.989
will get stuck together and
he'll be like why does he

39:40.990 --> 39:42.989
want me to put her up on the
block.

39:42.990 --> 39:46.119
And hopefully her head
explodes and somehow I'm

39:46.120 --> 39:48.989
safe this week.

39:48.990 --> 39:51.989
If I put you and Steve up
an Steve goes, are you going

39:51.990 --> 39:54.989
to hold it against me or.

39:54.990 --> 39:56.990
No.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.989
Hey, everybody, it's time
for the

40:11.990 --> 40:13.990
nomination ceremony.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.989
This is the nomination ceremony.

40:29.990 --> 40:33.989
It is my responsible as the
head of household to

40:33.990 --> 40:35.989
nominate two house guests
for eviction.

40:35.990 --> 40:38.989
I would turn two keys to
lock in my nominations and

40:38.990 --> 40:40.989
their faces will appear on
the memory wall.

40:40.990 --> 40:48.990
First house guest I've
nominateed is: The next

40:54.990 --> 41:02.990
house guest I've nominated
is: Western I've nominated

41:13.290 --> 41:16.699
you, Steve, and you Johnnie
mack.

41:16.700 --> 41:20.989
Steve, we definitely have
had our ups and downs but I

41:20.990 --> 41:21.990
absolutely adore you.

41:21.991 --> 41:25.989
You are a friend to me and I
want you it know this

41:25.990 --> 41:27.989
decision couldn't be farther
from personal.

41:27.990 --> 41:29.989
Johnnie, I have so much
respect for you as a

41:29.990 --> 41:30.410
competitor.

41:30.411 --> 41:34.989
You've won three vetoes, a
battle of the block and

41:34.990 --> 41:38.289
every competition that you
didn't win, just about you

41:38.290 --> 41:38.990
were runner-up.

41:38.991 --> 41:41.989
At the end of the day I
can't ignore the fact that I

41:41.990 --> 41:44.989
know in my gutter awe
ultimate loyalty is to each

41:44.990 --> 41:46.989
other this is a game
decision, all about what I

41:46.990 --> 41:50.989
think maximizes my own
probability of being able to

41:50.990 --> 41:52.409
make it to finals and
nothing more.

41:52.410 --> 41:58.989
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

41:58.990 --> 42:01.989
Vanessa's telling me I'm
not the target but anything

42:01.990 --> 42:03.409
can happen and there's
nothing like a guarantee to

42:03.410 --> 42:07.989
the final four and that only
guarantee is the veto.

42:07.990 --> 42:10.989
Pie gut is El iting me I
made the right nomination

42:10.990 --> 42:10.991
today.

42:10.991 --> 42:13.989
I'm just crossing my fingers
that it will stay the same

42:13.990 --> 42:15.999
and I don't have to put
Austin or Liz on the block

42:16.000 --> 42:18.989
as a replacement nominee
because that would

42:18.990 --> 42:20.539
complicate things.

42:20.540 --> 42:22.989
Vanessa has nominated
Steve and Johnnie mack which

42:22.990 --> 42:24.989
means she has kept her end
of the deal to myself and

42:24.990 --> 42:25.990
Liz.

42:25.991 --> 42:28.989
Now I need these nominations
to stay the same which means

42:28.990 --> 42:31.829
myself, Liz or Vanessa needs
to win that veto.

42:31.830 --> 42:33.989
The last thing I want
someone of them coming down

42:33.990 --> 42:36.989
and myself or Liz going up
on the block.

42:36.990 --> 42:39.989
Steve and ri sitting on
the block.

42:39.990 --> 42:41.989
We have been in this
situation before.

42:41.990 --> 42:44.989
I'm going to do whatever it
takes to keep me from

42:44.990 --> 42:45.950
walking out the door.

42:45.951 --> 42:47.989
I know my back is in the
corner now and I either win

42:47.990 --> 42:50.989
the veto or I'm evicted and
it's terrible.

42:50.990 --> 42:52.989
Who will win the power of veto.

42:52.990 --> 42:56.119
And will it be used to save
either John or Steve?

42:56.120 --> 42:59.989
And who will be leaving the
"Big Brother" house next?

42:59.990 --> 43:02.989

eviction episode Tuesday at

43:02.990 --> 43:10.990
