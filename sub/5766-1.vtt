00:01.800 --> 00:04.792
PETER:
Now I've worked hard to earn
forgiveness both from my family

00:04.830 --> 00:07.663
and from you,
the citizens of Chicago.

00:07.700 --> 00:09.429
That work is ongoing...

00:09.470 --> 00:11.438
(Alicia's phone rings)
ALICIA: Hello? Will?

00:11.470 --> 00:13.677
...and will continue,
but I'm confident...

00:13.710 --> 00:15.678
Huge press conference.
Is everything all right?

00:15.710 --> 00:18.270
...that it will continue
to make me a better husband...

00:18.310 --> 00:19.709
Wait. I can't hear you.

00:19.750 --> 00:22.048
(Will speaking indistinctly)
Hold on.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.512
PETER:
...a better public official.

00:23.550 --> 00:24.812
I just need to say it.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.353
We've been up and down,
back and forth, and I...

00:27.390 --> 00:29.221
Will._..
No, I Just
need to say this.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.625
No!

00:30.660 --> 00:32.355
Show me the plan.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.719
The what?

00:33.760 --> 00:35.296
The plan.

00:35.330 --> 00:36.695
I get the romance.

00:36.730 --> 00:38.129
I need a plan.

00:38.170 --> 00:40.559
PETER:
But it's unnecessary,
because Chicago...

00:40.600 --> 00:43.137
ALICIA:
Poetry's easy. It's
the parent-teacher

00:43.170 --> 00:44.137
conferences that are hard.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.432
Alicia, come on.

00:45.470 --> 00:46.801
I have to go now.
Come on.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.637
PETER:
I believe I am that change,

00:48.680 --> 00:52.172
and I believe
that I am that individual.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.244
PETER:
Thank you very much.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.111
(applause and cheering)

00:57.120 --> 00:58.109
Alicia?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.648
(phone ringing)

01:13.200 --> 01:13.859
Hey, thanks
for doing this.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.595
It'll be right here
for you.

01:17.770 --> 01:20.876
(phone line ringing)

01:20.910 --> 01:22.639
ALICIA:
I'm away from my phone

01:22.680 --> 01:24.500
at the moment,
so please leave a message.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.370
(voice mail beeps)
Hey, I just wanted to say...

01:26.420 --> 01:28.115
PETER (on TV):
You all know my wife...

01:28.150 --> 01:30.584
(reporters clamoring)

01:30.620 --> 01:33.180
Look, you're right.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.320
I don't have a plan.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.759
It's wrong.

01:37.790 --> 01:39.326
I'm your boss.
You're my employee.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.157
Let's just...

01:41.200 --> 01:42.758
drop this. Okay?

01:42.800 --> 01:44.495
PETER:
Now that hasn't been the focus

01:44.530 --> 01:46.191
of the current _
state's attorney's office.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.231
Instead, S.A. Glenn Childs...

02:02.920 --> 02:04.740
(phone beeps, speed-dials)

02:04.790 --> 02:06.758
ALICIA:
I'm away from my phone
at the moment,

02:06.790 --> 02:08.655
so please leave a message.

02:08.690 --> 02:11.352
(voice mail beeps)

02:11.390 --> 02:13.620
No. You know what?
I'm not just dropping this.

02:13.660 --> 02:14.888
You want to know my plan?

02:14.930 --> 02:17.125
My plan is, I love you, okay?

02:23.270 --> 02:25.204
I've probably loved you...

02:25.240 --> 02:27.208
ever since Georgetown.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.549
So phone me.

02:29.580 --> 02:33.641
I'll meet you anywhere,
and we will make a plan.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.781
If none of this makes sense
to you, just Ignore It.

02:39.820 --> 02:41.959
No embarrassment, nothing.

02:41.990 --> 02:45.357
We'll just go back
to where things stood.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.333
(phone chimes)

02:59.010 --> 03:00.477
WILL:
No. You know what?

03:00.510 --> 03:01.875
I'm not just dropping this.

03:01.910 --> 03:03.400
You want to know my plan?

03:03.450 --> 03:05.270
My plan is, I love you, okay?

03:05.310 --> 03:06.641
So phone me.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.545
I'll meet you anywhere.

03:08.580 --> 03:12.880
If none of this makes sense
to you, just Ignore It.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.457
PETER:
Cook County State's Attorney

03:15.490 --> 03:18.550
will put justice
before politics,

03:18.590 --> 03:21.957
public safety
before personal vendetta.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.763
(phone beeps)

03:23.800 --> 03:27.793
(Peter continues speaking
indistinctly in background)

03:36.450 --> 03:39.271
(reporters clamoring,
cameras snapping)

03:42.050 --> 03:44.416
Thank you for coming out
this morning.

03:44.450 --> 03:46.759
I have a short statement
I'd like to read.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.314
(cameras snapping)

03:48.360 --> 03:50.920
First, please let me apologize
to my wife,

03:50.960 --> 03:53.258
friends,

03:53.300 --> 03:55.291
staff, and fellow Coloradans

03:55.330 --> 03:56.968
for the shadow placed over them

03:57.000 --> 03:58.968
by these accusations.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.831
I did nothing wrong,

04:00.870 --> 04:03.566
but I can understand
how my actions

04:03.610 --> 04:05.532
over the last two years
have been misinterpreted.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.849
So let me say
without equivocation,

04:09.880 --> 04:14.670
I have always been faithful
to my wife.

04:14.720 --> 04:15.675
Not only...

04:15.720 --> 04:16.709
Yeah?

04:17.750 --> 04:19.354
I'm headed out.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.948
The Police Union speech?

04:20.990 --> 04:23.322
Yeah. Did you have
a chance to read it?

04:23.360 --> 04:25.624
It's good.

04:25.660 --> 04:27.389
The opening story...

04:27.430 --> 04:28.397
Not funny enough?

04:28.430 --> 04:29.897
Cut it.

04:31.470 --> 04:33.859
Listen, this...

04:33.900 --> 04:35.629
It's not us, Peter.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.865
You know, I have an hour today.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.537
I thought, uh...

04:39.580 --> 04:42.037
Thought I'd drop by
court and watch you work.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.399
Oh, that's okay.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.576
No, I really want to.

04:44.610 --> 04:45.747
It's a status hearing.

04:45.780 --> 04:46.917
Maybe another time.

04:46.950 --> 04:48.941
Okay.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.056
(TV clicks on)

04:53.090 --> 04:55.058
CONGRESSMAN TIMMERMAN:
The charges and gossip

04:55.090 --> 04:56.978
now being bandied about
in the press

04:57.030 --> 04:58.383
and through anonymous blogs...

04:58.430 --> 04:59.658
Am I boring you?

04:59.700 --> 05:00.928
Excuse me, Your Honor?

05:00.960 --> 05:02.564
I asked if
I'm boring you.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.726
I saw you check
your watch,

05:03.770 --> 05:05.419
and I thought I might
be holding you up.

05:05.470 --> 05:07.335
No, Your Honor. We have
a staff meeting in an hour.

05:07.370 --> 05:09.804
I was checking to make sure
I was on time, and I am.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.377
I'm so glad.

05:12.410 --> 05:13.729
Was that a smile,
Miss Long?

05:13.780 --> 05:16.476
No, Your Honor.
Food in my teeth.

05:16.510 --> 05:19.343
Okay, so, I love
when prosecutors

05:19.380 --> 05:22.747
and defense attorneys come
together and find agreement, but

05:22.790 --> 05:25.918
your client's restitution
should also include court costs,

05:25.950 --> 05:29.727
Mrs. Florrick, so if you don't
mind, you two can revise this

05:29.760 --> 05:32.422
while_I handle
a pretrial motion.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.392
JUDGE:
Tommy...

05:33.430 --> 05:34.829
Let me guess.
He hates women?

05:34.860 --> 05:37.397
No. He just checks his
Google alerts daily.

05:37.430 --> 05:38.692
You have more
than he does.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.698
So it looks like
you're off the hook.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.991
I'm...?

05:42.040 --> 05:43.667
Press has a new scandal.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.837
MAN _:
It's my right,
Your Honor!

05:45.870 --> 05:47.132
You are one day
away from trial.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.602
We have a jury.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.403
_I will not slow
this process down!

05:50.450 --> 05:51.371
It's my right

05:51.410 --> 05:52.547
to represent myself.

05:52.580 --> 05:53.877
You are not a lawyer, sir.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.444
Yeah, and I wasn't
an Alaskan fisherman

05:55.480 --> 05:57.016
till I stepped
on my first trawler.

05:57.050 --> 05:59.143
I wasn't a hacker
till I broke my first code...

05:59.190 --> 06:00.509
This is not a game.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.448
You are being accused of murder.

06:02.490 --> 06:04.082
It's a murder _
the government committed.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.621
The Pentagon murdered
my business partner

06:06.660 --> 06:08.389
and set me up for it.

06:08.430 --> 06:11.593
Why? Because
we posted top secret

06:11.630 --> 06:13.996
Pentagon video on our Web site!

06:14.040 --> 06:16.600
OpenSourceFind.com.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.437
And I don't care if you don't
believe me, Your Honor.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.607
It's my right

06:19.640 --> 06:21.505
under the 6th
and 14th Amendment

06:21.540 --> 06:23.508
to fire my attorney,
represent myself.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.869
(gavel banging)

06:24.910 --> 06:27.947
I will not allow
this court to become

06:27.980 --> 06:29.618
your personal
soapbox, Mr. Salle.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.709
And I won't watch
this trail turned over

06:31.750 --> 06:32.978
on appeal, you understand?

06:33.020 --> 06:34.157
You are getting a baby-sitter.

06:34.190 --> 06:35.885
That is not open
for discussion.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.059
Mrs. Florrick?

06:40.530 --> 06:42.862
Are you a member
of the Capital Litigation Bar?

06:42.900 --> 06:44.527
Uh, excuse me,
Your Honor?

06:44.570 --> 06:45.719
Are you a member

06:45.770 --> 06:48.136
of the Illinois
Capital Litigation Bar?

06:48.170 --> 06:49.569
Yes.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.134
Good.

06:51.170 --> 06:52.159
Congratulations.

06:52.210 --> 06:55.134
I'm appointing you
standby counselor to Mr. Salle.

06:55.180 --> 06:56.670
ALICIA:
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I have

06:56.710 --> 06:58.905
the Murphy/Gomes suit
going to trial next week.

06:58.950 --> 06:59.917
Who's the judge?

06:59.950 --> 07:01.144
Judge Fullerton.

07:01.180 --> 07:02.818
Good. My court
takes precedence.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.181
Trial starts tomorrow at 9:00.

07:04.220 --> 07:06.188
No. Your Honor, I can't!
You can't do this.

07:06.220 --> 07:07.551
Actually, ma'am,

07:07.590 --> 07:09.057
I can.
SALLE:
Your Honor,

07:09.090 --> 07:10.227
I just want
to point out...

07:10.260 --> 07:11.158
Don't you start!

07:11.190 --> 07:13.055
We are going to trial on this
tomorrow.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.226
Anything from you, Mr. Brody?

07:14.260 --> 07:15.488
The People are content.

07:15.530 --> 07:16.667
Of course, they are.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.794
Tommy, next case.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.058
(laughter)
DIANE: And his name just
kept coming up.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.069
Derrick Bond.
Derrick Bond.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.078
I go to Louisiana
to sign up fishermen

07:27.110 --> 07:29.578
for a BP class action,
and I find

07:29.610 --> 07:31.771
that half of them
have already been signed up

07:31.810 --> 07:33.744
by a small boutique D.C. firm.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.509
Imagine my frustration.

07:35.550 --> 07:36.915
(laughter)

07:36.950 --> 07:39.111
So I had to look up
this Derrick Bond.

07:39.150 --> 07:41.584
And I was surprised

07:41.620 --> 07:43.554
to find one
of the most gentlemanly

07:43.590 --> 07:45.080
young lavwers that
I have ever met.

07:45.130 --> 07:46.495
MAN:
Hear, hear.
WOMAN:
Yeah!

07:46.530 --> 07:47.827
(applause)

07:47.860 --> 07:50.260
Anyway, I couldn't be
happier about this merger.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.927
Will and I could not be happier.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.597
(applause)

07:55.040 --> 07:56.837
BOND:
Thank you, Diane.
Thank you, Will.

07:56.870 --> 07:59.907
Uh, I know that there
some unfamiliar faces around,

07:59.940 --> 08:02.238
so please, everyone,
introduce yourselves

08:02.280 --> 08:04.999
and communicate through...

08:05.050 --> 08:06.540
We're moving towards
a paperless office.

08:06.580 --> 08:09.014
We bring lobbyists,
you bring corporate.

08:09.050 --> 08:11.610
We bring DO,
you bring Chicago.

08:11.650 --> 08:13.686
With our current president's
ties to your city,

08:13.720 --> 08:15.608
we mean more together
than apart.

08:15.660 --> 08:16.922
(applause)
Hear, hear.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.120
Now,

08:18.160 --> 08:20.958
let me turn things over
to Bachelor number 16.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.251
(laughter)

08:22.300 --> 08:25.019
I'm not going to hear the end
of that, am I?

08:25.070 --> 08:26.219
No.
Neven

08:26.270 --> 08:27.760
WILL:
A few updates.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.631
We got a continuance on BP,

08:29.670 --> 08:32.571
so we'll need a few of you
to join us on the diocese depos.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.770
And the Murphy/Gomes suit got

08:33.810 --> 08:34.777
an expedited start date,

08:34.810 --> 08:37.301
so we'll need that team
to kick into high gear.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.102
So let's get going.
Will?

08:42.920 --> 08:44.911
ALICIA:
Will?

08:48.920 --> 08:51.150
Good job.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.589
Not me, you.

08:52.630 --> 08:54.552
Its like Invasion
of the Body Snatchers.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.568
As long as we're
the ones snatching.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.727
(laughter)

08:58.770 --> 09:00.089
How long do I have to wait

09:00.140 --> 09:01.630
before I get my
season tickets back?

09:01.670 --> 09:02.830
(laughs)
A polite week.

09:02.870 --> 09:04.007
Happy days.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.234
Just so you know,

09:05.270 --> 09:07.079
I'll be playing
this disgruntled.

09:07.110 --> 09:08.805
The excluded partner.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.046
Well, maybe we can shake

09:10.080 --> 09:11.308
something else loose
contractually.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.318
Oh, Derrick, we were
just talking about you.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.271
That went well,
didn't it?

09:14.320 --> 09:17.312
It did. It did.
A good group.
Very good.

09:17.350 --> 09:18.749
Will was just
talking the merger.

09:18.790 --> 09:19.916
He had a few concerns.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.609
Nothing big. Just
about office space.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.150
An equitable division.

09:23.190 --> 09:25.181
(overlapping chatter,
phones ringing)

09:27.860 --> 09:31.591
PETER (on TV):
An hour ago, I resigned as
State's Attorney of Cook County.

09:31.630 --> 09:33.837
NEWSCASTER:
Another year, another scandal.

09:33.870 --> 09:35.167
An_other woman
standing by her man...

09:35.200 --> 09:37.100
ASSISTANT:
Are you kidding?

09:37.140 --> 09:39.335
You'd rather have your husband
sleep with a prostitute?!

09:39.370 --> 09:41.600
If the choice was that or fall
in love with someone, yeah.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.777
One's just sex.

09:42.810 --> 09:44.107
The other's...
Shh.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.276
MAN (on TV):
Miss Correlli

09:45.310 --> 09:46.641
is a key member of my staff...

09:46.680 --> 09:47.647
Oops.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.282
ELI:
What happened
to your couch?

09:51.320 --> 09:53.254
Why, hello, Mr. Gold.

09:53.290 --> 09:54.951
It's gone.
Redecorating.

09:54.990 --> 09:57.629
I'm taking this
very personally.

09:57.660 --> 09:58.729
Oh, Mr. Gold.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.692
Do you know
what a tracker is?

09:59.730 --> 10:02.198
Do I know what a tracker is?

10:02.230 --> 10:03.663
No.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.099
An unpaid
political operative

10:05.130 --> 10:06.267
wh_o_ tracks _
the opp05ition candidate,

10:06.300 --> 10:09.360
trying to catch him off-guard
with a question or a comment

10:09.400 --> 10:12.062
in order to tape
the embarrassing encounter

10:12.110 --> 10:14.203
for free viral _
negative campaigning.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.208
Macaca?

10:16.240 --> 10:18.049
Result of a tracker.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.742
And I imagine this will all
come around to me.

10:20.780 --> 10:21.747
The events of this morning.

10:21.780 --> 10:22.940
This congressional scandal.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.208
You are back in the news.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.411
And Childs has people
tracking you.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.382
You know this?

10:29.420 --> 10:31.229
Well, I know what I would do,
and Ijust flip it

10:31.260 --> 10:33.251
to know what
my opponent Will do.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.294
Okay.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.730
So, if anyone approaches you
with a flip phone

10:43.770 --> 10:45.704
or an oddly shouted
comment,

10:45.740 --> 10:48.334
the best thing to do
is smile and move on.

10:48.380 --> 10:49.369
They will try
to follow you.

10:49.410 --> 10:52.174
Probably a college student,
often working in twos.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.770
Again, smile and move on.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.414
I'm trying to keep you out of
this, but it's modern politics.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.645
Wives are no longer
off-limits.

11:04.490 --> 11:06.697
Everything good here?

11:06.730 --> 11:08.254
Everything's good here.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.269
Anything else?

11:11.300 --> 11:13.791
No. I'm good.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.829
If you're good.

11:14.870 --> 11:15.859
I'm good.

11:17.770 --> 11:18.998
Hey, Will.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.473
Eli.

11:20.510 --> 11:22.171
You needed something?
Yes.

11:22.210 --> 11:24.701
Judge Matchick made me
standby counsel

11:24.750 --> 11:26.240
on a pro se case
starting tomorrow.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.747
You told him about
the Murphy/Gomes date?

11:27.780 --> 11:28.849
I did.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.017
He didn't seem to care.

11:30.050 --> 11:31.278
Yeah, that sounds
like Matchick.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.856
He's still proud
of a walk-on line

11:32.890 --> 11:33.959
he had in The Dark Knight.

11:33.990 --> 11:35.787
(chuckles)

11:35.820 --> 11:38.425
Okay, I'll have
Shawn take over.

11:38.460 --> 11:39.791
I think I can do both.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.127
No, it's okay.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.219
We're not starved
for personnel anymore.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.297
Merger going well?

11:46.330 --> 11:48.298
It is.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.262
I'm glad.

12:00.450 --> 12:03.419
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

12:12.530 --> 12:14.748
LANDRY:
Don't sweat the drug cases.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.121
Gag 'em and bag 'em.
Five to ten.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.298
On page two, you'll
find a summary

12:20.340 --> 12:22.934
of outstanding continuances.

12:22.970 --> 12:25.165
We may not have enough copies,
so share at the back.

12:25.210 --> 12:28.429
Let's not go continuance
crazy, okay, folks?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.801
Unless you're up against
Goldstein and Michaels.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.101
(all chuckling)

12:32.150 --> 12:34.175
Then all continuances
are welcome.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.312
Matan, what's up
with the pro se?

12:35.350 --> 12:38.012
Guy's running
a unicorn defense.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.950
He killed his business partner
for the money,

12:39.990 --> 12:41.184
and now he's trying to suggest

12:41.220 --> 12:43.188
it was some sort of
Pentagon conspiracy.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.425
Judge Matchick saddled him
with a wrangler.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.484
Alicia Florrick.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.350
Should be entertaining.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.288
LANDRY:
Anyone on break, sit in.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.321
Anything else?
Okay.

12:52.370 --> 12:55.237
Let's get
the bad guys.

12:55.270 --> 12:56.032
Matan.

12:56.070 --> 12:59.369
Why would Matchick
choose Florrick?

12:59.410 --> 13:01.298
Happenstance.

13:01.340 --> 13:02.272
She was there
on a settlement.

13:02.310 --> 13:05.074
Take Cary
as second chair.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.919
Sir, it was nothing.
It's okay.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.247
It's happenstance.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.440
It's an election year.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.209
There's no such thing
as happenstance.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.218
Matchick
supports Peter.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.454
He's pushing his wife
into a prominent position.

13:14.490 --> 13:15.479
Cary?

13:20.030 --> 13:21.827
I want you
to take second chair.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.828
Matan will bring you
up to speed, okay?

13:23.870 --> 13:24.996
You got it.

13:25.030 --> 13:27.089
You're up to speed.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.169
He was bleeding profusely
from the neck and chest.

13:32.210 --> 13:33.472
There also appeared to
have been a struggle

13:33.510 --> 13:35.307
before the shooting.
I attempted CPR,

13:35.340 --> 13:37.171
but the victim died
at the scene.

13:37.210 --> 13:38.347
Now, Detective,
at the crime scene,

13:38.380 --> 13:39.301
you also found shell casings,

13:39.350 --> 13:40.374
isn't that correct?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.375
Objection.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.478
On what grounds?

13:42.520 --> 13:43.839
On the grounds
of foundation.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.619
Mr. Salle,

13:45.650 --> 13:47.356
he was about to tell us
the foundation.

13:47.390 --> 13:48.550
May I have a ruling, Your Honor?

13:48.590 --> 13:49.921
Overruled.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.257
Exception.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.484
Mr. Salle, you know
that doesn't mean anything?

13:52.530 --> 13:55.158
Oh, I'm preserving your bias
for the record.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.997
Oh, dear God. Mrs. Florrick?

13:57.030 --> 13:59.498
Please, Mr. Salle,
let me argue for you.

13:59.530 --> 14:01.259
I'm very good at it.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.392
It's not about being
good, Mrs. Florrick.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.068
In a fight between
a man being paid

14:05.110 --> 14:08.329
and a man fighting for his
life, who would you bet on?

14:08.380 --> 14:10.109
I'm betting on myself.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.045
(sighs)

14:15.080 --> 14:16.240
Don't turn your back
to the jury.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.111
These nine millimeter casings

14:18.150 --> 14:19.412
you found at the scene?

14:19.450 --> 14:21.418
They are consistent
with a Russian-made

14:21.460 --> 14:23.951
Makarov semiautomatic.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.082
A very rare handgun?

14:25.130 --> 14:26.119
That's correct.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.252
And who owned
such a handgun?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.927
The defendant.
And when you arrested him,

14:28.960 --> 14:31.121
did he say what had happened
to his gun?

14:31.170 --> 14:32.398
He said it was missing.

14:32.430 --> 14:33.590
No more questions.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.596
Now, Detective,

14:35.640 --> 14:37.437
didn't I say
it had been stolen?

14:37.470 --> 14:38.937
You did.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.608
You said agents from the
government had stolen it.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.608
(quiet chuckling)
Did I say why?

14:42.640 --> 14:44.278
MATAN:
Objection.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.107
Actually, you know what?
Forget it.

14:46.150 --> 14:47.970
Let the jury hear this.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.442
You said the
government was upset

14:49.480 --> 14:52.950
because you had uploaded a
leaked video to your Web site.

14:52.990 --> 14:54.958
Was it this video

14:54.990 --> 14:58.323
that played on my Web site,
OpenSourceFind.com?

14:58.360 --> 15:02.023
This video is of a U.S.
predator drone assassinating

15:02.060 --> 15:04.369
an unarmed man
in Afghanistan.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.389
RODRIGUEZ:
Yes, I believe that's correct.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.534
And did I give you the name
of someone to talk to?

15:07.570 --> 15:11.336
Someone who could point to the
real killer at the Pentagon?

15:11.370 --> 15:13.372
You said to speak to one of your
volunteers: a woman named Onya

15:13.410 --> 15:15.469
who'd acquired the
video from a leaker.

15:15.510 --> 15:17.478
Did you speak to Onya,
this volunteer?

15:17.510 --> 15:19.046
MATAN:
Okay, I think I'll object

15:19.080 --> 15:20.342
at this point,
Your Honor.

15:20.380 --> 15:21.369
JUDGE:
Sustained.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.240
Mr. Salle, I already told you.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.245
The government is not

15:24.290 --> 15:27.157
on trial here.
You are.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.055
Well, maybe they should be.

15:29.090 --> 15:31.354
Do I think the U.S. government
killed his business partner?

15:31.390 --> 15:32.459
No.

15:32.490 --> 15:35.095
But I've got nothing
else to go on.

15:35.130 --> 15:37.223
Look, we're trying to be more
thrifty with Kalinda's hours,

15:37.270 --> 15:38.521
so I _can't have her
chasmg phantoms.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.561
Just do the best you can
with what you've got.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.329
What's your strategy?

15:42.370 --> 15:44.338
My strategy?

15:44.370 --> 15:46.509
Well, there's this one juror.

15:46.540 --> 15:48.269
I think he agrees with Salle.

15:48.310 --> 15:50.107
Every time
the judge overrules us,

15:50.150 --> 15:52.209
you can tell he
wants to hear more.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.569
He thinks we're
being censored.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.578
Quite a risk.
Trying to win over one juror.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.440
I only need one
for a deadlock.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.654
We can give her half a day.

16:01.690 --> 16:05.023
To hunt down
Pentagon assassms?

16:05.060 --> 16:08.359
_ To find sand to throw
in the prosecutor's case.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.195
KaHnda?

16:13.240 --> 16:14.491
What's up?

16:14.540 --> 16:16.633
Alicia needs help
ﬁngenng

16:16.670 --> 16:18.035
the Pentagon for a murder.

16:18.070 --> 16:19.469
How long do I have?

16:19.510 --> 16:20.602
The afternoon.

16:24.510 --> 16:25.602
Sorry.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.489
What?

16:33.390 --> 16:36.314
Sixteenth most
eligible bachelor.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.486
We're fine, Kalinda.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.679
Yeah, that
looked fine.

16:38.730 --> 16:41.198
Did you see the photo spread?

16:41.230 --> 16:42.390
Will in a swimsuit.

16:42.430 --> 16:43.590
He wasn't in a swimsuit.

16:43.630 --> 16:45.598
So you saw it, then?

16:45.630 --> 16:46.767
Talk to him.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.062
He doesn't want to.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.397
He told me.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.532
He wants to drop it.

16:50.570 --> 16:52.401
Yeah. In voice mail.

16:52.440 --> 16:55.705
Anything said in voice
mail doesn't count.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.174
Salle doesn't know who
leaked the pentagon video.

16:58.210 --> 16:59.541
He was insulated
from the leaker

16:59.580 --> 17:02.242
by a go-between activist
named Onya, no last name.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.781
Her last known address.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.481
But she's paranoid,

17:05.520 --> 17:07.317
so she moves around a
lot to av0id detection.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.419
Well, the good thing
about amateur paranoids

17:09.460 --> 17:10.620
is, they always leave
something behind.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.298
Talk to him.

17:14.330 --> 17:16.127
Life is short.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.369
PSYCHOLOGIST (on computer):
The most honest part

17:22.400 --> 17:24.504
of the body, which you
wouldn't guess, is the feet.

17:24.540 --> 17:25.700
NEWSCASTER:
The feet? You're kidding.

17:25.740 --> 17:26.809
PYSCHOLOGIST (chuckling):
No.

17:26.840 --> 17:27.738
Look at
Mrs. Timmerman's feet.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.476
They are pointing away
from her husband,

17:30.510 --> 17:32.307
almost as if to flee.

17:32.350 --> 17:35.513
Now, let's look at
Mrs. Clinton's feet.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.643
They are facing
toward her husband.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.715
This is a marriage
that can recover.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.650
Now let's look at
Alicia Florrick's feet.

17:41.690 --> 17:43.783
One foot is toward her husband.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.525
One foot is away
from her husband.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.199
It just signifies ambivalence.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.323
It's not going away.
That's the problem.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.099
It's not my scandal.
Thank you.

17:52.130 --> 17:53.336
It's Colorado.

17:53.370 --> 17:54.462
That's like going
to the moon.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.797
Every time they show
him, they show you.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.603
Every time they show his
wife, they show Alicia.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.629
So change the subject.

17:58.670 --> 18:00.433
Right, to Glenn Child's
divorce.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.504
No, Eli. No.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.609
Peter, you can't
keep leaving

18:02.640 --> 18:03.572
all your missiles
in the silo.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.168
I'm not leaving anything.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.575
This isn't about
being a good guy.

18:06.610 --> 18:07.747
We go after his family,

18:07.780 --> 18:09.372
then he's going
to come after mine.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.183
He's coming after
yours, either way.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.517
Then we'll wait
till he does.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.585
In the meantime,
change the subject

18:13.620 --> 18:15.178
to something positive.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.551
MAN:
So, without further ado...

18:16.590 --> 18:18.285
What am I doing
here, anyway?

18:18.330 --> 18:19.524
I present to you
the new...

18:19.560 --> 18:20.891
Get me in front
of some woman's group,

18:20.930 --> 18:22.898
so we can remind them
of the mutual respect.

18:22.930 --> 18:24.522
...Peter Florrick.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.629
(audience applauding
and cheering)

18:28.800 --> 18:30.358
Get me a_ list_
of any organizations

18:30.410 --> 18:31.468
giving out an award
this season.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.899
I don't care if it's the
Knitting Needlers of America.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.305
I need a visual.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.628
Oh. Sorry. Uh...

18:54.660 --> 18:58.460
My friend lives here and she
said I could get her key.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.762
Are you...?
The landlord.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.392
Who's your friend?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.691
Onya.

19:02.740 --> 19:03.866
Yeah. Uh...

19:03.910 --> 19:04.706
She moved out.

19:04.740 --> 19:07.607
Right. She leave
a forwarding address?

19:07.640 --> 19:09.505
No. No.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.677
She's a friend of yours?

19:10.710 --> 19:11.870
Yeah.

19:11.910 --> 19:13.673
Look, the thing is,

19:13.720 --> 19:15.642
she has my extra key,
and I'm locked out.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.511
I was hoping I could get in.

19:17.550 --> 19:19.643
Oh, there's nothing left in
there. She cleaned it out, so...

19:19.690 --> 19:22.352
It might be shoved to the
back of a drawer or something.

19:22.390 --> 19:23.584
Do you mind if I just check?

19:23.630 --> 19:26.428
Check? For your extra key? Um...

19:26.460 --> 19:28.257
It would really help.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.358
Please?

19:33.300 --> 19:35.598
Close the door
when you're done.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.834
Thank you.

20:01.260 --> 20:02.693
(clattering outside)

20:02.730 --> 20:03.890
(dog barking)

20:07.500 --> 20:09.593
I found it in the Dumpster
in the back.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.359
No SIM card. She must have taken
it when she left the apartment.

20:12.410 --> 20:14.605
So, it's a dead end?

20:14.640 --> 20:15.607
For the moment.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.779
But there was somebody
there just before me.

20:17.810 --> 20:20.449
I found chipped paint
under the air vent screws.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.368
So somebody must have
checked the vents

20:22.420 --> 20:23.614
after the apartment
was cleaned.

20:23.650 --> 20:25.288
Yeah. Sorry.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.719
I should have
cleaned that up.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.412
Oh, yes. Derrick said
you would be dropping by.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.382
_ This is_ Derrick's
in-house investigator,

20:31.430 --> 20:33.557
Blake, from DC.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.851
I picked the lock
in the apartment.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.754
Found a cell phone
hidden in the air vent.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.665
It looked like the
subject left in a rush.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.759
She left this in the
phone. SIM card.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.336
Much of it's encrypted.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.406
I can try and
decipher if you want.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.509
DIANE:
Uh, yeah.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.939
Let's see what
you can find.

20:46.970 --> 20:50.303
I wouldn't mind Kalinda
trying to decipher.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.477
She's done it
for me before.
Um...

20:52.510 --> 20:54.671
Yeah. Well, why don't you
work on it together?

21:02.060 --> 21:05.552
Did you ever find
your extra key?

21:05.590 --> 21:07.023
You knew who I was?

21:07.060 --> 21:08.527
Yeah.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.720
I wanted to see
how you'd play it.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.489
What are you, man
of a thousand faces?

21:11.530 --> 21:12.667
No.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.837
Just one.

21:13.870 --> 21:17.408
Does that flirtation bit
always work for you?

21:17.440 --> 21:19.431
Yeah.

21:19.470 --> 21:20.732
Are we going to have trouble?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.372
No.

21:22.410 --> 21:23.741
No. As far as
I'm concerned,

21:23.780 --> 21:25.441
it's your baclqard, Leela.

21:25.480 --> 21:28.517
Sorry. That's not
your name, is it?

21:28.550 --> 21:30.780
It's Kalinda.

21:30.820 --> 21:33.414
Kalinda's your name.
Right.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.626
Imagine my surprise when I
looked at the membership roll

21:40.660 --> 21:42.855
of the Women's Auxiliary
of the Botanical Gardens

21:42.900 --> 21:44.094
and saw your name.

21:44.130 --> 21:47.998
I was also surprised to see that
the Auxiliary has not awarded

21:48.040 --> 21:50.099
a "Friend of the Auxiliary"
in quite some time.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.904
Anyway, if you could talk
to the auxiliary...

21:52.940 --> 21:54.703
Well, certainly, Mr. Gold.

21:54.740 --> 21:55.934
How's the campaign going?

21:55.980 --> 21:57.470
The campaign?

21:57.510 --> 21:59.705
It's going very well,
ma'am. Thank you.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.513
Why?

22:01.550 --> 22:02.812
Oh, no reason.

22:02.850 --> 22:06.445
It's just that it seems
like you're coming to me

22:06.490 --> 22:07.787
more than I might expect.

22:07.820 --> 22:09.879
And how much did you expect,
Mrs. Florrick?

22:09.920 --> 22:13.629
I imagine that campaigns
are very complicated things.

22:13.660 --> 22:17.369
Maybe you need... help.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.095
What kind of help?

22:20.130 --> 22:22.837
I think we should
stay in touch.

22:22.870 --> 22:25.839
I think we should
talk regularly.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.474
I can offer you advice

22:27.510 --> 22:31.776
and you can ask questions
when you are confused.

22:35.450 --> 22:37.418
I think that's
a very good idea.

22:37.450 --> 22:38.417
Let's stay in touch.

22:38.450 --> 22:40.680
(washer buzzing)

22:43.160 --> 22:44.127
Objection!

22:44.160 --> 22:45.127
Overru_led.
Exception!

22:45.160 --> 22:46.525
And ye-yes, exception, I get it.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.027
JUDGE: Continue,
Mr. Brody.

22:48.060 --> 22:49.994
What other forensic evidence
did you collect

22:50.030 --> 22:51.167
from the scene, ma'am?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.690
We found partial
palm prints

22:52.730 --> 22:57.508
on the Cessna door and
fingerprints on the inside.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.098
MATAN:
And who did those
prints belong to?

22:59.140 --> 23:00.437
The defendant.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.436
MATAN:
No further questions.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.107
Have I been
on that plane before?

23:04.150 --> 23:05.879
Objection, Your Honor.
Beyond the scope.

23:05.910 --> 23:06.899
JUDGE:
Sustained.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.418
These prints of mine
on the plane--

23:09.450 --> 23:10.781
that doesn't mean
that I was at any time...?

23:10.820 --> 23:11.946
MATAN:
Objection.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.048
JUDGE:
Sustained.

23:13.090 --> 23:14.079
(whispers):
Did your investigation

23:14.120 --> 23:15.087
reveal you were
on the plane...?

23:15.120 --> 23:17.452
Did your investigation reveal

23:17.490 --> 23:19.958
that I had been on the plane
a week before the murder,

23:19.990 --> 23:21.457
and that could be the
source of the fingerprints?

23:21.500 --> 23:22.489
Yes.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.467
JUDGE:
Are we finished here,

23:25.500 --> 23:27.092
Mr. Salle?

23:27.130 --> 23:29.860
Uh, one second, Your Honor.

23:29.900 --> 23:32.437
Mr. Salle?

23:32.470 --> 23:34.472
Miss-- I forgot
your name.

23:34.510 --> 23:36.137
Loren.
Loren, sorry.

23:36.180 --> 23:38.648
What happened
to the sample #48?

23:38.680 --> 23:40.910
I don't understand the question.

23:40.950 --> 23:43.145
You collected
48 blood samples.

23:43.180 --> 23:44.147
Isn't that correct?

23:44.190 --> 23:46.146
No, 47 blood samples.

23:46.190 --> 23:47.088
Yes, 47 samples

23:47.120 --> 23:48.917
according to your
evidence list, and yet

23:48.960 --> 23:52.919
here on the crime scene photo,
there is a 48th sample.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.053
That's outside the
de5ignated crime scene.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.160
So, you found blood

23:58.200 --> 24:00.532
outside the designated
crime scene,

24:00.570 --> 24:02.037
and you decided
not to include it?

24:02.070 --> 24:03.059
MATAN:
Objection, Your Honor.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.101
This is
a large hangar,

24:04.140 --> 24:07.234
and this blood sample
was found by a tool kit

24:07.270 --> 24:08.931
which could have been left
by any random worker.

24:11.780 --> 24:13.748
Overruled.

24:13.780 --> 24:14.940
JUDGE: Answer
the question.

24:14.980 --> 24:18.188
We did a preliminary blood type
test of this blood sample,

24:18.220 --> 24:20.188
as we do with all our samples.

24:20.220 --> 24:22.882
It was O-negative,
not consistent with the victim.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.024
SALLE:
And what is my blood type?

24:26.260 --> 24:27.488
B-positive.

24:27.530 --> 24:29.191
So it wasn't consistent

24:29.230 --> 24:31.892
with my blood type either.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.091
No further questions.

24:41.210 --> 24:43.770
I haven't said this
in a while to anyone.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.608
Thank you.

24:54.820 --> 24:56.788
BLAKE:
Cryptbit encryption?

24:56.820 --> 24:58.822
You don't like
Lasermite?

25:01.560 --> 25:04.529
Try combining
Lasermite and Elcosec.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.526
Use them
as binary sifters.

25:06.570 --> 25:07.298
They'd cancel
each other out.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.537
Use Lase_rmite
for salting.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.765
So, what did you
find out about me?

25:12.810 --> 25:17.031
Some friends in DC.
said you phoned.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.105
You have enemies.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.811
(typing)

25:27.190 --> 25:29.988
Nice-- same
phone number.

25:30.590 --> 25:31.557
There, there, there.

25:31.590 --> 25:34.229
Every night at 7:30.

25:36.260 --> 25:39.195
Yeah._ _
You recognize it.

25:39.230 --> 25:41.198
Stan's Chicken Shack.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.004
She's ordering
takeout.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.234
You think
she would get takeout

25:45.270 --> 25:47.238
again from her new address?

25:52.780 --> 25:54.748
Hey, Leela.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.316
(clears throat)

25:56.350 --> 25:58.910
We should work together.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.111
Stop it.
What?

26:09.660 --> 26:13.960
It's been such a difficult
time for Peter and his family,

26:14.000 --> 26:15.831
and...

26:15.870 --> 26:19.761
this award will mean
so much to them.

26:19.810 --> 26:22.836
Now he needs us.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.006
Would you excuse me?

26:24.050 --> 26:25.347
Her daughter-in-law--

26:25.380 --> 26:26.847
that's who we should get.

26:26.880 --> 26:27.847
Oh, hello, Jackie.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.848
Hello, Ruth.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.313
We were just talking about
your daughter-in-law.

26:31.350 --> 26:33.341
Where is Alicia?

26:33.390 --> 26:34.857
Well, as you know, she works,

26:34.890 --> 26:38.189
but my granddaughter
is here-- Grace.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.186
Grace.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.289
She's thinking of joining
our cotillion.

26:42.330 --> 26:43.695
Oh.

26:43.730 --> 26:45.721
Grace!

26:47.900 --> 26:49.891
(sighing)

26:52.310 --> 26:55.768
It's so bogus, huh?

26:55.810 --> 26:58.677
Yeah, I got dragged here.

26:58.710 --> 26:59.745
Yeah.

26:59.780 --> 27:01.748
You, too?

27:01.780 --> 27:04.385
No, no, I'm...
I'm working.

27:04.420 --> 27:05.944
Doing what?

27:05.990 --> 27:07.753
You know.

27:07.790 --> 27:09.781
(both laugh)

27:11.690 --> 27:13.658
So has your mom or
dad said anything

27:13.700 --> 27:14.928
about this other scandal?

27:14.960 --> 27:17.099
The one right now?

27:17.130 --> 27:19.064
No. They kind of
just try to avoid

27:19.100 --> 27:20.294
the whole subject,
you know.

27:20.330 --> 27:23.231
They're still sleeping
in separate rooms?

27:25.440 --> 27:27.704
Who's that?

27:27.740 --> 27:29.901
BOY:
Oh, Steven--
he's in film school.

27:29.940 --> 27:31.441
So your parents
aren't sleeping

27:31.480 --> 27:34.938
together
anymore, right?

27:34.980 --> 27:36.675
And you used to do
accounting work

27:36.720 --> 27:37.914
for the victim, Mr. Kimball?

27:37.950 --> 27:39.110
Yes, and Mr. Salle.

27:39.150 --> 27:40.344
I'm sorry,
Miss Derbeken,

27:40.390 --> 27:42.915
could you please
move your hand?

27:42.960 --> 27:44.450
Yes, sorry.

27:44.490 --> 27:46.856
In fact, you traveled
with Mr. Kimball, didn't you?

27:46.890 --> 27:49.427
Yes, our job required
moving around a lot,

27:49.460 --> 27:50.495
so I stayed
in the same hotel.

27:50.530 --> 27:53.260
And you saw firsthand
a dispute between Mr. Kimball

27:53.300 --> 27:55.461
and the defendant
about their Web site?

27:55.500 --> 27:56.797
Yes, I did.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.262
In fact, could you describe

27:58.310 --> 27:59.959
the letter you saw
sent by Mr. Salle

28:00.010 --> 28:01.307
to the victim a week
before the murder?

28:01.340 --> 28:02.307
Object now.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.307
Why?
Do it.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.307
Objection.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.339
Your Honor,
this isn't hearsay.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.348
Miss Derbeken
is testifying

28:07.380 --> 28:09.314
to a letter she read herself,

28:09.350 --> 28:11.386
not what was heard.
Yes, but, uh...

28:11.420 --> 28:12.341
best evidence,

28:12.390 --> 28:15.359
Your Honor.

28:15.390 --> 28:17.483
I'm listening.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.418
The original
letter offers...

28:18.460 --> 28:20.052
The original letter offers
the best evidence,

28:20.090 --> 28:21.318
and it can't be testified to

28:21.360 --> 28:22.896
if the letter is not produced.

28:22.930 --> 28:25.865
Where is the letter?

28:25.900 --> 28:27.390
Oh, come on.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.364
Your Honor, we can't establish
motive unless we hear from her.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.231
JUDGE: That's not my
problem, Mr. Brody.

28:31.270 --> 28:32.806
The objection is sustained.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.398
Miss Derbeken
cannot testify

28:34.440 --> 28:36.374
to the letter.

28:37.780 --> 28:40.248
Know what I want to do
if I get out?

28:40.280 --> 28:41.315
Go to law school.

28:41.350 --> 28:42.977
MATAN: _
He's got no case, Sir.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.238
He's still arguing
a unicorn defense.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.416
And he's beating you.

28:46.450 --> 28:47.382
He's got no case,

28:47.420 --> 28:48.387
and he's beating you.

28:48.420 --> 28:49.387
Cary.

28:49.420 --> 28:50.387
Don't do this--

28:50.420 --> 28:51.819
he's a first year.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.452
I don't care if he's
just out of law school.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.496
Can you beat her?

28:56.530 --> 28:59.067
Uh... we just caught a
bad break, Mr. Childs.

28:59.100 --> 29:00.419
That's not what I asked.

29:00.470 --> 29:01.437
Can you beat her?

29:01.470 --> 29:03.438
Yes.
YouTe
first chair.

29:05.470 --> 29:08.337
I don't know how long
you plan to stay with us,

29:08.380 --> 29:11.247
but that's not how you endear
yourself to your coworkers.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.907
Oh, is that
what this is about--

29:12.950 --> 29:15.510
endearment?

29:15.550 --> 29:17.017
DIANE:
Oh, uh, one last thing.

29:17.050 --> 29:19.086
How are you
on partners' offices?

29:19.120 --> 29:20.109
Diane has a corner office.

29:20.150 --> 29:21.151
I have a partial corner

29:21.190 --> 29:23.249
with more
square footage.

29:23.290 --> 29:24.484
We could splurge for either.

29:24.530 --> 29:28.125
One of the things we did
at our old office was

29:28.160 --> 29:31.197
move the partners' offices
into the core of the building

29:31.230 --> 29:33.835
and made the_outside
communal assoqate areas.

29:33.870 --> 29:35.337
It fostered goodwill.

29:37.370 --> 29:40.339
Do you prefer
an interior office?

29:41.380 --> 29:43.371
Let me think on it.

29:43.410 --> 29:45.469
And I would
like to start

29:45.510 --> 29:47.205
a partner mentorship program.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.512
Well, we already
unofficially

29:48.550 --> 29:50.040
mentor associates.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.513
I think it'll create
greater goodWIll

29:51.550 --> 29:53.859
if we officially mentor.

29:53.890 --> 29:55.551
There's one
more thing.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.188
Peer review.

29:59.230 --> 30:00.481
We don't choose who to fire.

30:00.530 --> 30:02.395
Associates grade each other.

30:02.430 --> 30:04.523
It creates
community.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.526
Yeah, like Lord of the Flies.

30:06.570 --> 30:08.231
(laughs)

30:08.270 --> 30:11.103
Um, well,
let us think on that.

30:15.610 --> 30:18.408
Are we being played
in some way?

30:18.450 --> 30:19.872
I don't see how.

30:19.910 --> 30:21.468
I don't either.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.408
It's making me
suspicious.
(chuckles)

30:23.450 --> 30:25.042
CASHIER:
Stan's Chicken Shack on 58th.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.615
Yeah, I just phoned a minute ago
for my delivery order.

30:27.650 --> 30:30.084
I just want to check
I gave you the right address.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.087
The name's Onya.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.529
No delivery by that name.

30:32.560 --> 30:35.199
Are you sure
you have the right...?
(phone beeps off)

30:36.360 --> 30:37.520
(dialing)

30:39.600 --> 30:42.091
(line ringing)

30:42.140 --> 30:43.493
CASHIER 2:
Stan's Chicken Shack.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.532
Yeah, I think I might have
given you the wrong address.

30:46.570 --> 30:49.073
Uh, the name's Onya.

30:50.110 --> 30:52.340
Oh, yeah, you got a new address?

30:52.380 --> 30:55.178
Uh, no, I-I thinkI may have
given you the wrong address.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.176
Uh, what do you have?

31:01.060 --> 31:02.186
Is that right?

31:02.220 --> 31:03.482
Yeah, yeah,
that-that's really good.

31:03.520 --> 31:06.318
Thank you, bye.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.327
Hi.

31:13.370 --> 31:16.396
Hi.
You ready to take
another go at this?

31:17.700 --> 31:19.201
What is lupus?

31:19.240 --> 31:21.003
Lupus is a disease
in which

31:21.040 --> 31:22.371
the immune
system attacks...

31:22.410 --> 31:23.672
Objection, Your Honor.

31:23.710 --> 31:24.677
Uh,

31:24.710 --> 31:26.041
beyond the scope.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.377
JUDGE:
Hmm, I'm going
to overrule on that.

31:27.410 --> 31:28.547
I'd like to see

31:28.580 --> 31:30.218
where this is going.
Lupus is a disease

31:30.250 --> 31:32.389
in which the immune
system attacks

31:32.420 --> 31:34.285
the body's cells
and tissue,

31:34.320 --> 31:36.550
resulting in inflammation
and tissue damage.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.682
How common is it?

31:37.720 --> 31:38.755
LOREN:
Fairly common.

31:38.790 --> 31:41.657
It affects perhaps one out
of every 1,000 Americans.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.328
Does the defendant Mr. Salle
suffer from lupus?

31:44.370 --> 31:46.520
Lupus erythematosus,
yes, he does.

31:46.570 --> 31:50.688
Now, what is another
odd artifact of lupus?

31:50.740 --> 31:52.662
Well, if you withdraw
medication,

31:52.710 --> 31:54.234
it can change your blood type.

31:54.280 --> 31:58.546
CARY:
Hmm, so Mr. Salle could
have O-negative blood

31:58.580 --> 31:59.672
one week, and
if he changed

31:59.710 --> 32:02.440
his medication,
B-positive the next?

32:02.480 --> 32:03.981
LOREN:
That is correct.
Wow.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.317
Now...

32:05.350 --> 32:08.478
this blood sample
that you took from a tool kit

32:08.520 --> 32:09.987
in the hangar--
this blood sample

32:10.020 --> 32:12.159
that Mrs. Florrick
and her mentor

32:12.190 --> 32:14.158
worked so diligently
to get into evidence--

32:14.200 --> 32:17.966
did you expedite a DNA test
looking for a match?

32:18.000 --> 32:18.967
I did.
And who

32:19.000 --> 32:19.967
did it match?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.594
LOREN:
Mr. Salle the defendant.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.437
CARY:
Well, no further questions.

32:24.470 --> 32:25.607
The prosecution rests.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.218
KALIN DA:
Onya.

32:42.260 --> 32:43.454
No, no, no,
Vance sent me.

32:43.490 --> 32:45.026
I work with his lavwers.

32:45.060 --> 32:47.278
I'm not Onya
you're looking for...

32:48.700 --> 32:49.655
Okay, they know
you're in there.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.019
Don't go back in there.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.128
Come on.

32:52.170 --> 32:56.288
Look, Vance wants to help,
but he needs your help, too.

32:56.340 --> 32:59.059
You know who shot
Kimball, right?

32:59.110 --> 33:00.634
Was it the government?

33:00.670 --> 33:03.104
Shh.

33:03.140 --> 33:04.368
What?

33:04.410 --> 33:05.707
The Feds use strollers.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.399
They're transmitters.

33:07.450 --> 33:10.214
They're easy to disguise.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.712
The guy who leaked me the video?

33:13.750 --> 33:17.413
He was afraid that Kim_bal|
was g0ing to name him,

33:17.460 --> 33:19.348
so he killed him.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.024
Onya, you have
to testify to that.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.697
No. No, he'll kill you.

33:26.730 --> 33:28.288
He'll kill me, too.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.364
We can hide your identity.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.061
No, you can't.

33:31.110 --> 33:35.137
If you bring me into that
court, I will plead the Fifth.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.431
Look at her.

33:36.480 --> 33:39.301
Like that's
a real baby.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.312
Okay, then tell me
the name of the leaker.

33:45.350 --> 33:46.544
I'll take the risk.

33:46.590 --> 33:49.309
Come on. It's the least
you can do for Vance.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.157
KALIN DA:
Good news

33:51.190 --> 33:52.179
is we found the leaker.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.458
CIA analyst,
Edgar Barkus.

33:53.490 --> 33:56.254
The bad_ news?
He's missmg.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.824
Office was cleared out
a month ago.

33:57.860 --> 33:59.327
DIANE:
So, what are we saying?

33:59.370 --> 34:00.667
It is a government conspiracy?

34:00.700 --> 34:02.258
Or the Pentagon
found their leaker.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.268
WILL:
Alicia?

34:11.410 --> 34:13.844
Use her. Use Onya.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.542
I don't understand.

34:16.580 --> 34:18.081
Prosecution is winning

34:18.120 --> 34:19.644
because they're arguing
a straightforward case

34:19.690 --> 34:21.317
with a straightforward motive.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.510
Your client killed over money:
possession of his Web site.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.323
You need a straightforward
alternative.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.850
Jealousy.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.391
Who's jealous?

34:28.430 --> 34:30.227
Onya.
But she'll plead
the Fifth.

34:30.260 --> 34:31.420
Right, so use her.

34:42.140 --> 34:44.108
ALICIA:
Onya, you're familiar

34:44.150 --> 34:47.369
with Mr. Kimball's accountant,
Jeanine Derbeken?

34:47.410 --> 34:49.571
ONYA:
What do you mean, familiar?

34:49.620 --> 34:51.247
You know who she is?

34:51.290 --> 34:52.382
Yes.

34:52.420 --> 34:55.583
This should be
interesting.

34:55.620 --> 34:56.848
You have to go?

34:56.890 --> 34:58.619
Yeah. Take care.

34:58.660 --> 35:01.458
ALICIA:
And you knew that
Jeanine would often stay

35:01.500 --> 35:03.320
in Mr. Kimball's hotel room
when he traveled?

35:03.360 --> 35:05.760
No.
You didn't
know that?

35:05.800 --> 35:07.597
But you also traveled
with Mr. Kimball, didn't you?

35:07.630 --> 35:09.291
I did, yeah.

35:09.340 --> 35:10.261
And...

35:10.300 --> 35:11.665
did you ever fight with Jeanine?

35:11.710 --> 35:13.359
ONYA:
With. . .?

35:13.410 --> 35:15.173
No.
You never fought
with Jeanine

35:15.210 --> 35:16.336
over the attentions
of Mr. Kimball?

35:16.380 --> 35:17.677
CARY:
Objection.

35:17.710 --> 35:18.847
Sustained.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.245
So, Onya,

35:20.280 --> 35:23.340
the week before the murder--
this is

35:23.380 --> 35:25.382
the week Mr. Kimball received
the leaked video--

35:25.420 --> 35:28.184
did you and Mr. Kimball travel
to Washington DC?

35:30.890 --> 35:32.778
It's a simple
question, Onya.

35:32.830 --> 35:36.652
Did you and Mr. Kimball stay
together in Washington, DC?

35:38.530 --> 35:40.395
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

35:40.430 --> 35:41.533
that it may incriminate me.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.934
JUDGE:
Are you sure that's
what you want to do?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.436
You're pleading the Fifth?

35:50.480 --> 35:52.368
Yes.

35:52.410 --> 35:53.707
You're worried

35:53.750 --> 35:56.412
about relating what happened
with the victim

35:56.450 --> 35:58.441
in Washington DC?
I refuse to answer

35:58.490 --> 36:00.310
on the grounds that
it may incriminate me.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.322
Miss, I want to make sure

36:04.360 --> 36:05.281
I understand_ what
you're saying.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.286
Your Honor, the witness
already answered...

36:07.330 --> 36:09.525
Are you pleading the Fifth
because you were involved

36:09.560 --> 36:11.619
in Mr. Kimball's murder, or
because of the leaked...?

36:11.670 --> 36:14.298
Your Honor, it is not your place
to ask my witness.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.466
Yes, it is,
Mrs. Florrick.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.865
Now, you are taking
the Fifth...

36:16.900 --> 36:18.800
ALICIA:
Your Honor, if you
compel my witness

36:18.840 --> 36:19.704
to answer this question,

36:19.740 --> 36:21.230
I am moving
for an immediate mistrial.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.872
Denied. I'm asking
a simple question...

36:22.910 --> 36:24.639
You are not, sir!
Mrs. Florrick...

36:24.680 --> 36:26.875
You are piercing
the Fifth Amendment right.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.639
Mr. Florrick, shut up.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.716
No, sir.

36:30.750 --> 36:31.739
Excuse me.

36:33.390 --> 36:35.278
As long as you are attempting

36:35.320 --> 36:37.413
to circumvent
her Fifth Amendment right,

36:37.460 --> 36:38.484
I will not shut up.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.827
You will shut up,

36:39.860 --> 36:41.452
or be held in contempt.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.626
Then hold me in contempt,

36:42.660 --> 36:44.264
and I will refer this

36:44.300 --> 36:46.825
to the Judicial Conduct
Committee for immediate action.

36:56.540 --> 37:00.977
This court will adjourn
until tomorrow morning.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.410
(gavelbangs)

37:03.450 --> 37:05.441
(water running)

37:17.630 --> 37:19.621
I'm almost done.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.235
What are you up to?

37:27.570 --> 37:29.538
Peter.

37:31.380 --> 37:33.268
I saw you in
court today.

37:33.310 --> 37:35.016
Yeah?

37:35.050 --> 37:37.348
You were
amazmg.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.281
Peter, I've got to...
study.

38:06.810 --> 38:08.812
Peter, I have to study.

38:08.850 --> 38:10.818
(radio news program
playing quietly)

38:10.850 --> 38:13.387
Okay.

38:13.420 --> 38:15.411
Let me.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.609
(gasps)

38:27.870 --> 38:30.395
(Alicia sighs contentedly)

38:36.110 --> 38:39.773
So, let's just go at this
from a different angle.

38:39.810 --> 38:41.573
Do you know of any motive

38:41.620 --> 38:44.441
Mr. Salle might have had
to murder Mr. Kimball?

38:44.490 --> 38:45.388
I refuse to answer

38:45.420 --> 38:48.457
on the grounds that it
might incriminate me.

38:48.490 --> 38:49.809
Now, are you pleading the Fifth
because you were involved

38:49.860 --> 38:50.884
in the murder, or...

38:50.920 --> 38:52.888
I refuse to answer
on the grounds

38:52.930 --> 38:54.488
that it might
incriminate me.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.466
So, you want to follow me again?

38:59.500 --> 39:01.388
Have me do your work for you?

39:01.440 --> 39:03.533
BLAKE:
Nope, I have something for you.

39:03.570 --> 39:05.367
I picked it up on
my police scanner.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.970
A kid found the murder weapon
down by the river.

39:08.010 --> 39:10.877
A Russian-made _
Makarov semi-automatic.

39:10.910 --> 39:12.400
The cops have it?

39:12.450 --> 39:14.372
They're checking it
for prints right now.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.547
My guess is, your client
didn't wipe it down.

39:16.580 --> 39:17.376
How long do we have?

39:17.420 --> 39:19.012
I know your Chicago
cops are slow,

39:19.050 --> 39:20.540
but I'd say
you got few minutes.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.388
And you still want
to plead the Fifth?

39:25.430 --> 39:28.888
ONYA: I refuse to answer...
CARY: No more questions.

39:28.930 --> 39:31.057
JUDGE:
Mrs. Florrick?

39:31.100 --> 39:32.419
Your next witness.

39:32.470 --> 39:35.394
Defense rests, Your Honor.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.395
What are you doing?
We still have

39:36.440 --> 39:37.395
to refute the blood evidence.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.032
Defense rests.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.572
Your Honor, The
People are unprepared

39:43.610 --> 39:44.577
for closing arguments.

39:44.610 --> 39:45.872
That's unfortunate,
Mr. Agos,

39:45.910 --> 39:46.877
because I am.

39:46.910 --> 39:48.411
Well, we request

39:48.450 --> 39:49.269
a five-minute recess.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.414
No, Mr. Agos.
This trial has gone on

39:52.450 --> 39:54.111
much longer than I anticipated,
and I'm tired.

39:54.150 --> 39:58.587
So you go now,
or you don't go.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.052
(sighs)

40:00.090 --> 40:02.923
And where does that
leave the defense?

40:02.960 --> 40:04.928
CARY:
In tatters.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.461
_Look at their
Witnesses. Oops.

40:07.500 --> 40:12.062
I'm sorry. Their one witness.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.600
Your Honor,
I need to interrupt.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.471
The police have just uncovered
a new piece of evidence.

40:15.510 --> 40:17.933
Mr.Brody, you
know as well as I

40:17.980 --> 40:20.448
that once the prosecution
starts its closing arguments,

40:20.480 --> 40:21.970
there is no new evidence.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.488
Yes, Your Honor, but these are
extraordinary circumstances.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.112
Well, that's
unfortunate, Mr. Brody.

40:26.150 --> 40:28.459
If the jury deadlocks,
you may use

40:28.490 --> 40:29.809
your extraordinary circumstances
in the next trial.

40:29.860 --> 40:34.058
The jury will ignore
Mr. Brody's statements.

40:34.090 --> 40:37.093
You may continue,
Mr. Agos.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.590
(footfalls)

40:40.630 --> 40:41.426
Hey.

40:41.470 --> 40:44.507
About your peer
review suggestion.

40:44.540 --> 40:47.532
We thought we could try it for
one year as a pilot program.

40:47.570 --> 40:48.502
Okay.

40:48.540 --> 40:49.973
Oh, and we're still
working on getting you

40:50.010 --> 40:51.648
a smaller office
Without a Window.

40:51.680 --> 40:52.977
But in the meantime,

40:53.010 --> 40:54.147
you'll have to
live With this.

40:54.180 --> 40:55.545
Thank you.

40:55.580 --> 40:58.048
You shoot the hoops?

40:58.080 --> 40:59.547
I do.

40:59.590 --> 41:02.718
We got an afternoon league.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.079
A few judges,
lawyers.

41:04.120 --> 41:06.088
We could use some
Baltimore blood.

41:06.130 --> 41:09.054
Oh, you can't handle
some Baltimore blood.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.590
(laughs)

41:11.670 --> 41:13.160
(chuckles)

41:13.200 --> 41:14.861
That's how it starts.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.578
Still deliberating?
Yep.

41:26.610 --> 41:27.577
You know,
that gun they found?

41:27.610 --> 41:29.578
The Feds have a way of making
this stuff pop up

41:29.620 --> 41:30.848
right when they need it.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.586
They're offering
you five years.

41:32.620 --> 41:33.587
They're... Who is?

41:33.620 --> 41:34.757
The state's
attorney's office.

41:34.790 --> 41:36.655
Five years, second degree.

41:36.690 --> 41:39.750
But you're... I mean,
we're not considering it.

41:39.790 --> 41:40.882
Yes, we are.

41:40.930 --> 41:42.659
It just takes one.

41:42.700 --> 41:43.553
Yeah, it just takes
one to deadlock.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.726
Yes.

41:44.770 --> 41:47.295
And if the jury deadlocks,
the gun is in.

41:47.330 --> 41:49.230
A deadlock works against you.

41:49.270 --> 41:50.635
I can say
the government planted...

41:50.670 --> 41:51.762
Oh, Vance, stop it.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.630
You did it.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.170
Right now, you're in control.

42:00.210 --> 42:01.973
Once the jury comes in,
it's out of your hands.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.511
Take the five years.

42:20.330 --> 42:22.161
Did he take it?

42:22.200 --> 42:23.667
The five years? Yes.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.533
It was the smart move.

42:29.740 --> 42:31.571
I'm your new mentor.

42:31.610 --> 42:34.841
See you tomorrow morning.
