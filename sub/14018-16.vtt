00:01.683 --> 00:03.424
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.485 --> 00:07.365
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:07.422 --> 00:09.231
the police
who investigate crime

00:09.291 --> 00:12.101
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.867
These are their stories.

00:17.699 --> 00:19.645
She'll call us in
when she's ready.

00:19.701 --> 00:22.944
We're already paying 30
bucks for a 50-minute hour.

00:23.004 --> 00:24.847
You just don't want to be here.

00:24.906 --> 00:26.476
How'd you figure that out?

00:26.541 --> 00:28.919
You're supposed to be
doing this for yourself.

00:28.977 --> 00:31.753
What, so some shrink
can tell me I'm a pig?

00:31.813 --> 00:34.589
I know I'm a pig,
like most guys.

00:34.649 --> 00:37.255
Look, women want
everything from one guy.

00:37.319 --> 00:39.424
Guys want one thing
from a lot of women.

00:39.487 --> 00:41.160
It's human nature.

00:43.124 --> 00:45.730
You're right.
We're wasting our time.

00:48.963 --> 00:50.237
Dr. Burk?

00:56.671 --> 00:59.015
Dr. Burk?

00:59.074 --> 01:02.544
Eric! Eric!

01:04.512 --> 01:07.254
She's got scratches on her
arm, a bruise on her neck.

01:07.315 --> 01:09.818
She went a couple of rounds
before she was counted out.

01:09.884 --> 01:10.988
What time was that?

01:11.052 --> 01:14.033
Eight to 12 hours ago. Single
stab wound to the chest.

01:14.089 --> 01:16.194
We're still looking
for the weapon.

01:16.257 --> 01:17.600
I don't see a purse.

01:17.659 --> 01:19.900
It's in the desk drawer
along with her wallet,

01:19.961 --> 01:22.874
78 bucks and a half-dozen
credit cards.

01:24.065 --> 01:25.510
Make sure she gets a rape kit.

01:25.567 --> 01:26.944
MAN: Right.

01:27.035 --> 01:29.345
Cleaning crew comes
through here around 8:00.

01:29.404 --> 01:31.179
How often do your people
patrol this area?

01:31.239 --> 01:32.912
Every hour.
What about vagrants?

01:32.974 --> 01:34.044
Any problems there?

01:34.109 --> 01:35.383
We don't let them
become a problem.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.923
Okay, I'd like to see your security
logs for last night, all right?

01:37.979 --> 01:40.050
Sure.
I'll bring them up.

01:40.115 --> 01:41.219
All right,
the receptionist said

01:41.282 --> 01:44.195
that Dr. Burk's last appointment
was yesterday at 7:00 p.m.

01:44.252 --> 01:46.129
Allison and Dennis Hall.

01:46.187 --> 01:47.962
Must've been some
counseling session.

01:48.022 --> 01:49.399
Please, my name is George Burk.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.368
The hospital called me. They
told me my wife had been hurt.

01:51.426 --> 01:52.769
Okay, let's just go sit
over here, all right?

01:52.827 --> 01:55.706
Can't I see her? I've been
looking for her all night.

01:57.332 --> 01:59.073
Oh, God. Is that her?

01:59.134 --> 02:00.169
Take it easy.

02:00.235 --> 02:04.741
Linda! Linda! Let me go!

02:04.806 --> 02:06.149
BRISCOE: All right, there's
nothing to see here.

02:06.207 --> 02:07.481
Show's over. Take a hike.
Come on.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.970
I spoke to her
just before 9:00.

02:59.027 --> 03:01.371
She said she was leaving
in a few minutes.

03:01.429 --> 03:03.636
Coming right home?
Yes.

03:03.698 --> 03:06.736
She usually takes
a cab out front.

03:06.801 --> 03:09.407
By 10:00,
I started to worry.

03:09.470 --> 03:13.043
I called her back.
She didn't answer.

03:13.107 --> 03:15.587
You waited an hour?

03:15.643 --> 03:19.955
I thought maybe she stopped
to pick up dinner.

03:20.014 --> 03:22.153
I waited another half hour,

03:22.217 --> 03:25.255
and then I phoned
the hospital security.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.095
Who'd you talk to?

03:28.223 --> 03:29.793
I don't remember.

03:31.025 --> 03:34.768
He said that he was gonna send
someone to check her office.

03:36.297 --> 03:38.607
He called back
15 minutes later.

03:38.666 --> 03:40.577
He said that she wasn't there.

03:42.203 --> 03:46.652
Then I started calling the
hospitals and the police.

03:47.075 --> 03:48.884
Did she mention if
any of her clients

03:48.943 --> 03:50.047
had been giving her trouble?

03:50.979 --> 03:52.117
No.

03:52.180 --> 03:53.853
CURTIS: She always
work this late?

03:53.915 --> 03:56.020
Yes.

03:56.084 --> 03:58.121
Besides the people
she sees at the hospital,

03:58.786 --> 04:00.663
she has private clients.

04:01.489 --> 04:04.060
And she consults
for the Archdiocese.

04:05.693 --> 04:07.639
Right. I talked to him.

04:07.695 --> 04:10.471
He called here about 10:30,
all upset about his wife.

04:10.532 --> 04:12.170
So, you sent somebody
to check on her.

04:12.233 --> 04:14.736
Uh-huh.
Checked out. No problem.

04:14.802 --> 04:16.803
Except her door wasn't locked.

04:16.870 --> 04:18.577
Who'd you send?

04:18.640 --> 04:21.017
Let me think. Rollins.

04:23.211 --> 04:27.091
According to your logs, Rollins
was in the north wing at 10:40.

04:27.148 --> 04:30.425
Isn't that all the way on the
other side of the hospital?

04:30.485 --> 04:32.692
Then it must've been Jarrett.

04:33.288 --> 04:34.528
Jarrett?

04:35.990 --> 04:39.301
It says here that Jarrett was
handling a disturbance in the ICU.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.362
A homeless woman
caught stealing syringes.

04:41.429 --> 04:43.136
Look, the fact is, you
didn't send anyone up

04:43.197 --> 04:44.540
to Dr. Burk's office,
did you?

04:44.599 --> 04:46.579
Hey, she's five minutes
late getting home.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.545
I can't screw up
my entire rotation.

04:48.870 --> 04:50.474
So instead,
you lied to her husband.

04:50.538 --> 04:52.245
I got two people
out with the flu.

04:52.307 --> 04:53.445
And how'd this homeless woman

04:53.508 --> 04:56.011
make it all the way up to the
ICU without being detected?

04:56.077 --> 04:59.024
She was caught.
I call that being detected.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.286
Well, you're gonna
give us your records

05:00.348 --> 05:03.886
of all the other homeless people you
detected in the last six months.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.895
CURTIS: This place
had some month.

05:08.957 --> 05:11.563
Theft of drugs, trespassing,
indecent exposure,

05:11.626 --> 05:14.766
defecating in a public area,
theft of patient meals.

05:14.829 --> 05:16.604
That's a crime?
Autopsy came in.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.166
No sign of sexual assault.

05:18.232 --> 05:21.975
M.E. thinks the murder weapon
was a pair of scissors.

05:22.036 --> 05:24.983
Rey, those photos
from her office?

05:25.039 --> 05:27.076
There's one skell they caught
last month stealing linen.

05:27.141 --> 05:28.381
"Subject was male Caucasian."

05:28.443 --> 05:31.549
"Identified himself as
Pope Adrian VI of Utrecht."

05:31.613 --> 05:33.320
"Subject was ejected from
the premises."

05:33.381 --> 05:34.416
"Subject was wearing"

05:34.482 --> 05:38.055
"green raincoat and red baseball
cap from a dry cleaning store."

05:38.119 --> 05:39.598
All decked out
for Christmas, huh?

05:39.654 --> 05:41.964
There it is, next to her desk.

05:44.158 --> 05:46.434
"Stain's Dry Cleaning."

05:47.095 --> 05:49.541
No good deed goes unpunished.

05:49.597 --> 05:52.840
My wife talked me into letting
her brother do the hats.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.779
Stan's Dry Cleaning. This
is what he came back with.

05:55.837 --> 05:57.475
"Stains."
He thought it was cute.

05:57.538 --> 05:58.642
How many hats did you get?

05:58.706 --> 05:59.741
Like this?

05:59.807 --> 06:02.151
Just the one. I had him fix it
before I ordered the others.

06:02.210 --> 06:03.587
And you tossed this one?

06:03.645 --> 06:06.524
I put it in with the clothes
people leave past 60 days,

06:06.581 --> 06:09.118
then I took them over to
St. Remy's on 30th Street.

06:09.183 --> 06:10.491
BRISCOE: Thanks.

06:10.685 --> 06:12.892
Sorry, I don't pay
attention to their hats.

06:12.954 --> 06:15.764
This guy thinks
he's Pope Adrian VI.

06:15.823 --> 06:17.063
Leonard.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.763
I don't know his last name.
What's he done?

06:18.826 --> 06:21.238
Well, it's in connection with a murder at St.
Anne's Hospital.

06:21.295 --> 06:23.468
Murder? Doesn't
sound like Leonard.

06:23.531 --> 06:24.771
Once you start thinking
you're the Pope,

06:24.832 --> 06:26.971
it's not much of a stretch
to killing people.

06:27.035 --> 06:28.036
Does he sleep here?

06:28.102 --> 06:29.740
No. He doesn't
like the noise.

06:29.804 --> 06:30.976
Well, it's better
than freezing.

06:31.039 --> 06:32.712
Oh, he's in good health.

06:32.774 --> 06:35.550
I'm sure he's found a way
to keep warm at night.

06:35.610 --> 06:36.850
When was the last
time you saw him?

06:36.911 --> 06:39.050
Last week.
He came in for supper.

06:39.113 --> 06:42.560
I noticed he was wearing
hospital scrubs under his coat.

06:42.617 --> 06:44.722
Thanks for your help.

06:44.786 --> 06:46.823
Scrubs?
He'd blend in.

06:46.888 --> 06:49.664
Yeah, and make himself at home.

06:52.994 --> 06:54.974
CURTIS: You people
never checked up here?

06:55.029 --> 06:57.236
McGIVEN: Not since they
closed down the floors.

06:57.298 --> 06:59.505
What's the point? There's nothing
to steal up here anyway.

06:59.567 --> 07:04.038
I smell a big, fat lawsuit,
McGiven, with you as Exhibit A.

07:04.105 --> 07:05.948
MAN: Here we are.

07:08.376 --> 07:09.411
(BRISCOE SIGHING)

07:09.477 --> 07:13.220
And here it is, Rey.
The Holy See.

07:13.281 --> 07:14.589
McGIVEN: Give us a day.

07:14.649 --> 07:16.322
This guy shows up,
we'll catch him.

07:16.384 --> 07:17.556
Yeah, right.

07:17.618 --> 07:18.892
If we hadn't had
the hospital searched,

07:18.953 --> 07:21.058
this guy would've started
holding Sunday services

07:21.122 --> 07:23.033
right here under your nose.

07:23.091 --> 07:24.661
MAN ON RADIO:
Unit One, this is Unit Two.

07:24.726 --> 07:25.796
Yeah, go ahead.

07:25.860 --> 07:28.136
There's a male Caucasian
matching the suspect

07:28.196 --> 07:30.176
in the second floor
waiting area.

07:33.968 --> 07:35.174
He's in there.

07:47.148 --> 07:48.149
Hey, how's it going?

07:48.216 --> 07:49.718
The nurse at the desk
wanted me to tell you

07:49.784 --> 07:52.390
she has free toys
for your kids.

07:52.887 --> 07:55.197
She said just go ahead and
bring them right over.

08:00.795 --> 08:02.468
Hey, stop!

08:05.333 --> 08:07.244
All right, take it
easy, Your Holiness.

08:07.301 --> 08:08.507
Help us!
It's all right, buddy.

08:08.569 --> 08:11.550
Save us from these
Lutheran blasphemers!

08:12.173 --> 08:13.550
I know this place.

08:13.608 --> 08:16.020
First there's the tears,
then the blood.

08:16.077 --> 08:18.114
So you've been
here before, huh?

08:18.179 --> 08:20.523
They wanted me to renounce
transubstantiation.

08:20.581 --> 08:22.686
To deny the Eucharist.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.856
I'm gonna be sorry I asked,
but who's "they"?

08:25.920 --> 08:28.400
The Princes of Germany.

08:28.456 --> 08:30.367
What about Dr. Burk?

08:30.858 --> 08:32.996
Did she ever do
anything to you?

08:33.594 --> 08:36.164
She's not a doctor.
She's a nun.

08:36.998 --> 08:39.342
Her baptismal name
is Katherina von Bora.

08:39.900 --> 08:43.371
Oh, that's a secret.
She's hiding from him.

08:43.437 --> 08:44.472
Him?

08:44.539 --> 08:46.610
The Antichrist.
The Devil of Wittenberg.

08:46.674 --> 08:47.812
You mean Martin Luther?

08:48.509 --> 08:50.113
Yes. Yes.

08:50.178 --> 08:53.352
Now, Dr. Burk,
she a pal of yours?

08:54.215 --> 08:55.455
I took a vow of poverty.

08:55.516 --> 08:57.553
She bought me boots. See?
Yeah, fine.

08:57.618 --> 08:59.291
WOMAN: Lieutenant.

08:59.353 --> 09:02.766
So you've been up to her office,
then, on the third floor?

09:02.824 --> 09:05.600
I don't go to women's rooms.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.661
Your hat does.

09:08.629 --> 09:10.870
My miter.
I gave it to her.

09:11.599 --> 09:13.943
When?
Days ago.

09:14.001 --> 09:17.414
To let her enemies know she was
protected by the power of the Holy See,

09:17.471 --> 09:21.078
by the authority of the Vatican,
and the infallibility of the Pope.

09:21.142 --> 09:23.418
Her enemies
being Martin Luther?

09:23.477 --> 09:25.252
And his minions.

09:26.180 --> 09:29.354
A blasphemous whore
with a crown of fire.

09:29.417 --> 09:32.762
She was screaming at her,
one-two-three-four-five days ago,

09:32.820 --> 09:34.629
defying the authority
of the Bishop,

09:34.689 --> 09:36.396
of Canon Law,
and the Council of Trent.

09:36.457 --> 09:37.492
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

That's for us.
You can wait here.

09:44.799 --> 09:47.609
His prints are in the system.
Leonard Gardner.

09:47.668 --> 09:51.013
Multiples for trespassing,
vagrancy, petty theft.

09:51.072 --> 09:54.610
He spent the night of the murder in the
16 for urinating on a public street.

09:54.675 --> 09:55.949
Was released the next day.

09:56.010 --> 09:57.216
The times check out?

09:57.278 --> 09:59.849
I called over. He was
grabbed up at 7:30.

09:59.914 --> 10:01.621
So he goes back
to tending his flock,

10:01.682 --> 10:04.253
and we go back to
scratching our heads.

10:04.318 --> 10:06.559
He said Dr. Burk had an
argument with someone

10:06.621 --> 10:08.965
over the authority
of the Bishop.

10:09.023 --> 10:12.027
Didn't she do some work
for the Archdiocese?

10:13.060 --> 10:15.199
(BELL TOLLING) MARINO:
This is a terrible loss.

10:15.263 --> 10:17.106
Linda Burk was
very highly regarded.

10:17.164 --> 10:18.700
What did she do
for the Archdiocese?

10:18.766 --> 10:20.575
Mostly prenuptial counseling.

10:20.635 --> 10:21.773
No fireworks there.

10:21.836 --> 10:24.442
She also handled the less pleasant end.
Annulments.

10:24.505 --> 10:27.247
Ah, the catholic divorce
after the real divorce.

10:27.308 --> 10:31.017
As far as we're concerned, the
annulment is the real divorce.

10:31.078 --> 10:32.182
Linda would meet
with the parties

10:32.246 --> 10:35.386
and give our tribunal an
evaluation of the marriage.

10:35.449 --> 10:37.520
Her word carry a lot of weight?

10:37.585 --> 10:39.929
Our tribunal usually followed
her recommendations.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.024
The annulments
ever get contested?

10:42.089 --> 10:45.662
Father O'Brien would
know more about that.

10:45.726 --> 10:46.932
Well, if a former
Mr. and Mrs.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.268
are still raw from the divorce,

10:48.329 --> 10:49.330
it can get messy.

10:49.397 --> 10:51.673
And someone like Dr. Burk
gets caught in the middle.

10:51.732 --> 10:54.406
Was she having any problems
with her current cases?

10:54.468 --> 10:56.243
You think?

10:56.304 --> 10:57.715
Well, she mentioned
the Kilpatricks.

10:57.772 --> 10:59.183
She didn't go into specifics.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.311
She was still preparing
her evaluation.

11:01.375 --> 11:03.616
Would you happen to
have their file handy?

11:03.678 --> 11:05.658
Oh, they had a lousy
divorce last year.

11:05.713 --> 11:07.624
This didn't improve their mood.

11:07.915 --> 11:09.223
Which way was
the annulment going?

11:09.283 --> 11:10.853
Well, we're waiting
for Linda's input.

11:10.918 --> 11:13.660
Unless her report turns up,
we're back to square one.

11:13.721 --> 11:15.723
Well, whose idea
was the annulment?

11:15.790 --> 11:17.736
The husband, Mr. Kilpatrick.
He filed the petition.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.965
I understand he wants to get
remarried in the church.

11:20.394 --> 11:21.566
Hmm.

11:21.629 --> 11:22.972
Look at this.
Love letters.

11:23.030 --> 11:26.068
"Dear Molly," signed Gary.
Dated 16 years ago.

11:26.133 --> 11:28.170
We look at their state of
mind when they got married.

11:28.235 --> 11:30.772
If they lacked due
discretion of judgment.

11:30.838 --> 11:31.976
Meaning what?

11:32.039 --> 11:35.418
Well, if the bride or groom had a
screw loose or their fingers crossed

11:35.476 --> 11:37.513
when they said their I dos,
it's grounds for annulment.

11:37.578 --> 11:40.491
Dr. Burk was supposed to have
read their minds 16 years back?

11:40.548 --> 11:44.826
Rey, the Kilpatricks
in happier times.

11:44.885 --> 11:46.091
Pretty hair, huh.

11:47.388 --> 11:49.163
Pretty fire-red hair.

11:49.223 --> 11:53.296
Say hello to the blasphemous
whore with the crown of fire.

11:55.296 --> 11:59.711
I saw Dr. Burk Monday
evening at her office.

11:59.767 --> 12:02.805
I had some concerns about
the annulment evaluation.

12:02.870 --> 12:04.042
Concerns?

12:04.105 --> 12:05.584
Questions. Why?

12:05.639 --> 12:08.586
She was murdered Tuesday
night in her office.

12:11.912 --> 12:13.289
Do you think I killed her?

12:13.347 --> 12:15.793
We're talking to everybody
who had business with her.

12:15.850 --> 12:17.852
Where were you Tuesday night?

12:17.952 --> 12:22.594
Here, with my son, Billy.
(MICROWAVE BEEPS)

12:22.656 --> 12:24.795
And the argument
you had with Dr. Burk?

12:24.859 --> 12:26.805
No, it wasn't an argument.

12:26.861 --> 12:29.341
BRISCOE: But you were upset
about the annulment.

12:29.397 --> 12:31.001
I was upset at my husband.

12:31.065 --> 12:36.014
He wants the church to wave a wand and
pretend our marriage never happened.

12:36.070 --> 12:37.743
To turn our son into a bastard.

12:37.805 --> 12:40.547
He wanted you to roll
over so he could remarry?

12:40.608 --> 12:41.814
Mmm-hmm.

12:41.876 --> 12:44.482
And if Dr. Burk said so, he'd
get his annulment, wouldn't he?

12:46.814 --> 12:49.158
BRISCOE: Mrs. Kilpatrick,
did Dr. Burk tell you

12:49.216 --> 12:51.253
what she was
going to recommend?

12:52.520 --> 12:55.501
I think I've said
everything I want to say.

12:55.556 --> 12:57.035
I'd like you to leave, please.

12:58.793 --> 13:00.670
I don't know what
she told my ex-wife.

13:00.728 --> 13:02.401
I spoke to
Dr. Burk on Monday.

13:02.463 --> 13:05.501
I got the impression
things were going our way.

13:05.566 --> 13:08.479
Was Burk going to recommend
for the annulment?

13:08.536 --> 13:10.379
She didn't come
right out and say so,

13:10.438 --> 13:13.419
but as Gary's attorney,
I was reasonably optimistic.

13:13.474 --> 13:16.580
BRISCOE: And did you share your
optimism with Mrs. Kilpatrick?

13:16.644 --> 13:19.022
I may have mentioned
it to her attorney.

13:19.079 --> 13:21.582
By the way, did you
find the evaluation?

13:21.649 --> 13:23.629
The Archdiocese said
she was still working on it.

13:24.085 --> 13:25.291
(SCOFFS)

13:26.854 --> 13:28.959
You in a hurry to take
another walk down the aisle?

13:29.757 --> 13:31.634
My fiancée is
a devout catholic.

13:31.692 --> 13:34.002
I don't want this
thing to drag out.

13:34.695 --> 13:39.075
Mental unfitness is grounds for annulment.
Mrs. Kilpatrick fits the bill.

13:39.133 --> 13:41.010
You're not in divorce
court now, Counselor.

13:41.068 --> 13:43.480
I'm not speculating.
She has to be medicated.

13:43.537 --> 13:46.450
She even took a swing at me a
year ago, during a deposition.

13:46.507 --> 13:48.043
Can't imagine why.

13:48.109 --> 13:49.645
Sheila Atkins is her lawyer.

13:49.710 --> 13:51.917
She provoked it.
They're both a piece of work.

13:51.979 --> 13:53.083
They lost the divorce.

13:53.147 --> 13:56.822
I don't think Molly Kilpatrick
could stand losing again.

13:56.884 --> 13:58.488
Have a nice day.

14:00.621 --> 14:03.966
Divorce lawyers. God's way
of telling you to stay single.

14:04.024 --> 14:05.128
Or married.

14:05.192 --> 14:07.468
Let's find out which way
Burk was leaning.

14:09.096 --> 14:10.473
As far as I can tell,

14:10.531 --> 14:14.343
these are just notes taken during her
interviews with the Kilpatricks.

14:14.401 --> 14:17.041
Summaries.
Copy of the petition.

14:17.104 --> 14:19.914
Nothing that looks like
the evaluation you want.

14:19.974 --> 14:21.612
Well, no luck here either.

14:21.675 --> 14:23.382
I found drafts of
three other evaluations,

14:23.444 --> 14:25.355
but nothing on the Kilpatricks.

14:25.412 --> 14:26.516
Did you check her home?

14:26.580 --> 14:28.924
Yeah. Any place else
it might be?

14:28.983 --> 14:30.826
Mmm. Afraid not.

14:30.918 --> 14:34.229
Lennie, the computer when they
found her, it was on, right?

14:34.288 --> 14:36.097
Yeah.

14:36.724 --> 14:39.204
I searched her computer's memory.
Your hunch was right.

14:39.260 --> 14:40.762
The Kilpatrick file
was deleted.

14:40.828 --> 14:41.898
Well, I assumed so.

14:41.962 --> 14:44.203
And then, just to make sure
that we couldn't recover it,

14:44.265 --> 14:45.539
they optimized the hard drive.

14:45.599 --> 14:48.808
That I know they did
at 9:28 Tuesday night,

14:48.869 --> 14:50.871
according to the
computer's internal clock.

14:50.938 --> 14:52.849
About the same time
Burk was bleeding out.

14:52.907 --> 14:54.215
What'd they do again?

14:54.275 --> 14:56.812
They reorganized all
the data in the memory.

14:56.877 --> 14:58.982
Anything that was erased,
it's gone for good.

14:59.046 --> 15:01.219
Well, except as
electronic flotsam

15:01.282 --> 15:04.229
and jetsam bobbing
on a pool of silicon.

15:04.285 --> 15:06.492
Now, if you're smart enough,
you can skim the surface.

15:06.554 --> 15:08.591
And you're smart enough?
Oh, yeah.

15:08.656 --> 15:11.830
"Mrs. Kilpatrick has demonstrated
mental instabilities."

15:11.892 --> 15:13.269
"Her immaturity raises doubts"

15:13.327 --> 15:15.329
"as to whether the
Kilpatricks truly formed"

15:15.396 --> 15:18.104
"the requisite
marital bond which..."

15:18.165 --> 15:19.337
That's it?

15:19.400 --> 15:20.845
Everything with
Kilpatrick in the text.

15:20.901 --> 15:23.643
Sounds like Burk was
recommending annulment.

15:23.871 --> 15:27.580
You have to be some kind of computer
whiz to do this erasing trick?

15:27.641 --> 15:29.120
Well, your suspect
would have to know

15:29.176 --> 15:31.952
more than just how
to turn the machine on.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.388
Molly Kilpatrick is
a terrific employee.

15:35.449 --> 15:37.656
I don't want her to think
I'm talking behind her back.

15:37.718 --> 15:39.664
Does she work with computers?

15:39.720 --> 15:41.563
Of course.
Like all bookkeepers.

15:41.622 --> 15:43.693
We're a long way
from Bob Cratchit.

15:43.757 --> 15:47.034
Well, does she hunt and
peck, or is she good at it?

15:47.094 --> 15:48.539
She knows all of the software.

15:48.596 --> 15:49.973
She even helps
train our recruits.

15:50.030 --> 15:52.442
So she's familiar with
disk optimizing programs?

15:52.499 --> 15:53.978
Absolutely.

15:54.034 --> 15:55.377
What kind of trouble is she in?

15:55.436 --> 15:56.540
Who said she's in trouble.

15:57.204 --> 16:00.083
Last Tuesday evening, you
remember what time she left?

16:00.140 --> 16:02.142
Early.
Just before 6:30.

16:02.209 --> 16:03.313
That's early?

16:03.377 --> 16:04.788
She's here till 8:00,
usually.

16:05.012 --> 16:06.047
She had to see her lawyer.

16:06.113 --> 16:07.888
She say if
she had any plans later?

16:07.948 --> 16:11.691
No. I guess it was the usual.
Dinner at home and a video.

16:11.752 --> 16:12.787
BRISCOE: With her son?

16:12.853 --> 16:14.764
Not Tuesday nights.
He's with his father.

16:15.122 --> 16:16.760
You sure of that?
Are you kidding?

16:16.824 --> 16:19.361
It took them eight months to work
out the custody arrangement.

16:19.426 --> 16:21.599
They even had me
give a deposition.

16:24.598 --> 16:26.600
That's right, she was here.

16:26.667 --> 16:29.477
Any more than that, like the color
of her blouse, I can't tell you.

16:29.536 --> 16:31.482
BRISCOE: What about what
time she left, Ms. Atkins?

16:31.538 --> 16:32.573
That's not privileged.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.143
And you know this
because you're an attorney?

16:35.209 --> 16:38.156
Molly told me that you're trying to
implicate her in Dr. Burk's murder.

16:38.212 --> 16:40.453
Well, she wasn't too thrilled
about the annulment.

16:41.215 --> 16:43.161
Who told you that,
Mr. Kilpatrick?

16:43.217 --> 16:44.696
He's the one who
needs the annulment.

16:44.752 --> 16:47.289
Because of his
devoutly catholic fiancée.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.425
Not his fiancée, her parents.

16:49.490 --> 16:51.731
They are rich devout catholics.

16:51.792 --> 16:56.104
Kilpatrick is looking for some relief.
We soaked him pretty good.

16:56.497 --> 16:59.205
Really? Well, his lawyer seems to
think it was the other way around.

17:00.134 --> 17:02.307
Paul Redfield would
like to believe that.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.370
But at the end of the day,

17:03.437 --> 17:06.281
he's not the one putting all those
zeroes on the alimony checks.

17:06.339 --> 17:09.583
And as to what time your client
left and where she was going?

17:09.943 --> 17:12.719
I'm not saying
anything about that.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.453
That's too bad, Ms. Atkins,

17:14.515 --> 17:17.086
'cause right about now, she could
use some help with her alibi.

17:18.218 --> 17:21.722
Yeah, she told us she was home
alone with her son that night.

17:21.789 --> 17:24.030
Turns out the kid spends
Tuesdays with his dad.

17:24.157 --> 17:25.296
Oh.

17:25.358 --> 17:28.271
You're just a fountain
of misinformation.

17:28.329 --> 17:29.603
Billy has dinner
with his father,

17:29.663 --> 17:31.870
who then drives him to
hockey practice at 8:00.

17:31.932 --> 17:37.280
Molly picks him up and
takes him home. Happy?

17:38.205 --> 17:39.479
Ecstatic.

17:41.342 --> 17:45.347
She showed up, all right.
At around 8:30, with bells on.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.619
Eighty-proof bells,
or something else?

17:47.681 --> 17:49.126
She's a pill head.

17:49.183 --> 17:51.185
She tried to pull
her kid out of practice.

17:51.251 --> 17:54.130
Poor kid was embarrassed. I
finally got her out the door.

17:54.188 --> 17:55.724
Her ex told me
how to handle her.

17:55.789 --> 17:57.769
So this wasn't the first time?

17:57.825 --> 18:00.328
No, she came to a game
about two months ago.

18:00.394 --> 18:03.000
Mr. Kilpatrick shows up
with his girlfriend,

18:03.063 --> 18:04.974
Mrs. Kilpatrick goes nuts.

18:05.032 --> 18:08.206
And I thought the players were
the only ones allowed to fight.

18:08.268 --> 18:10.248
The next day,
their lawyers got into it.

18:10.304 --> 18:11.942
I had to submit
a game schedule,

18:12.005 --> 18:13.882
and they negotiated
who could come when.

18:13.941 --> 18:16.717
Last Tuesday evening,
what time did practice end?

18:16.777 --> 18:18.120
9:30, same as always.

18:18.178 --> 18:19.953
She pick him up?

18:20.013 --> 18:23.085
No. Billy said she told
him to take a cab home.

18:24.018 --> 18:25.224
Thanks.

18:26.754 --> 18:29.166
I was home sleeping.

18:29.223 --> 18:32.397
Did you talk to anyone?
Maybe on the phone?

18:32.459 --> 18:34.029
No, I don't think so.

18:34.094 --> 18:37.405
Well, you're not really clear
about that night, are you?

18:37.464 --> 18:39.671
Is that because of the pills?

18:41.035 --> 18:42.776
Come on, Molly.
We asked around.

18:42.836 --> 18:45.180
You were taking
Prozac and Valium.

18:46.607 --> 18:47.608
Can I have a cup of coffee?

18:48.108 --> 18:50.588
They're just making
a fresh pot. Rough night?

18:52.446 --> 18:53.550
Am I going to be here long?

18:53.614 --> 18:55.116
Hey, if you want
to leave, go ahead.

18:55.182 --> 18:56.490
But we have to warn you,

18:56.550 --> 19:00.362
the District Attorney can use
that as a reason to arrest you.

19:02.156 --> 19:04.659
So how many Valium
you take every night?

19:04.725 --> 19:06.398
One.

19:06.460 --> 19:07.495
Sometimes two.

19:07.561 --> 19:08.801
CURTIS: But some days
it's more, yeah?

19:08.862 --> 19:10.273
I don't keep a running count.

19:10.330 --> 19:11.707
How about that Tuesday?

19:11.765 --> 19:13.767
Was it three or four?
I don't know.

19:13.834 --> 19:15.871
Well, it was enough that you
went home and passed out.

19:15.936 --> 19:16.971
I was very tired.

19:17.037 --> 19:19.347
You remember
what time that was?

19:19.406 --> 19:21.147
No.

19:21.208 --> 19:22.516
Well, how long
after you left the rink?

19:22.576 --> 19:23.714
Half an hour?
An hour? What?

19:23.944 --> 19:26.720
(STUTTERING)
I'm not exactly sure.

19:26.780 --> 19:27.986
It couldn't have been an hour.

19:28.048 --> 19:30.426
BRISCOE: You remember
what happened at the rink?

19:30.484 --> 19:31.588
I went to see my son.

19:31.652 --> 19:34.132
Yeah, you tried to yank
him off the ice, right?

19:34.188 --> 19:36.168
You were hysterical.
I don't think so.

19:36.223 --> 19:37.793
You were yelling
at his coach, Molly.

19:37.858 --> 19:38.893
People saw you.

19:38.959 --> 19:41.735
Now, maybe you just don't remember
it because of the pills you took.

19:42.896 --> 19:44.375
I don't know.
It's no big deal.

19:44.431 --> 19:46.035
I mean, you let off
some steam at his coach,

19:46.100 --> 19:47.807
and you just don't
remember it, right?

19:48.736 --> 19:50.340
Right?
Yeah.

19:50.404 --> 19:52.077
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

19:53.607 --> 19:55.314
Her divorce lawyer's outside.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.685
Mrs. Kilpatrick's son
told her she was here.

19:57.745 --> 19:59.088
This lady's starting to slip.

19:59.146 --> 20:02.355
We don't have all day. Her lawyer's
chewing through the leash.

20:04.818 --> 20:07.162
Pot's almost ready.

20:07.221 --> 20:09.827
So, Molly, I read up
on annulments.

20:09.890 --> 20:11.597
Ninety percent
of them are granted,

20:11.658 --> 20:13.831
whether they're
contested or not.

20:14.094 --> 20:15.869
Now, to me, that
sounds like a rigged game.

20:15.929 --> 20:18.603
And I say that being
a practicing catholic.

20:18.665 --> 20:20.076
Same as you, yeah?

20:20.133 --> 20:21.168
Yes.

20:21.235 --> 20:24.842
It's like the church is saying all
these marriages never existed.

20:24.905 --> 20:27.647
Now, when you took your vows
in the church before God,

20:27.708 --> 20:29.710
you meant them, yeah?
Yes.

20:30.077 --> 20:31.647
And so did your husband.

20:31.712 --> 20:33.555
Yeah, I read
the letters he sent you.

20:33.847 --> 20:35.224
He really loved you.

20:36.149 --> 20:38.186
And now, what, 16 years later,

20:38.252 --> 20:41.062
he wants the church to,
how did you put it,

20:41.121 --> 20:44.295
"Wave a wand and
say it never happened"?

20:44.358 --> 20:45.359
Yes.

20:45.425 --> 20:46.802
He expected you to
go along with that?

20:46.860 --> 20:49.136
To lie before God?

20:49.196 --> 20:50.573
I wouldn't do it.

20:50.631 --> 20:52.702
Is that what you told
Dr. Burk on Monday,

20:52.766 --> 20:54.336
when you had those concerns?

20:54.401 --> 20:55.539
She didn't care!

20:55.602 --> 20:57.445
She knew he was lying
about the marriage.

20:57.504 --> 21:00.383
About me.
About the money, even.

21:00.441 --> 21:03.547
BRISCOE: So you went back on
Tuesday, after you left the rink?

21:03.610 --> 21:04.987
No, I went home.

21:05.579 --> 21:08.321
Wait a minute. Wait. You just said
that you blanked out at the rink.

21:08.382 --> 21:10.362
Next thing you remembered, you
were passed out in your bed.

21:10.417 --> 21:12.055
BRISCOE: That leaves
a big gap, Molly.

21:12.119 --> 21:14.497
Hey, if you were on drugs,
Molly, you're not responsible.

21:14.555 --> 21:16.432
If it was an accident
or self-defense,

21:16.490 --> 21:18.561
the D.A. has to take
that into consideration.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.605
Nothing'll happen to you.
What are you saying?

21:20.661 --> 21:22.368
We're giving you a chance
to help yourself.

21:22.429 --> 21:24.932
Hey, look, you had every
right to be angry at her.

21:24.998 --> 21:27.205
Things just got out of control, right?
Isn't that what happened?

21:27.267 --> 21:28.541
BRISCOE: Maybe she
did something to you.

21:28.602 --> 21:29.876
She pushed you,
you grabbed the scissors.

21:29.937 --> 21:31.041
That's self-defense.

21:31.104 --> 21:32.344
Yeah, I bet you didn't
even mean to hurt her.

21:32.406 --> 21:34.511
I mean, you just swung the
scissors, and it was bad luck.

21:34.575 --> 21:35.610
It was an accident, right?

21:35.676 --> 21:38.020
Molly, you tell us it was an
accident, you can walk out of here.

21:38.078 --> 21:39.489
Go ahead, Molly.

21:39.546 --> 21:42.186
You took all those pills and you
accidentally killed her, right?

21:42.249 --> 21:43.284
(DOOR OPENS)

21:43.350 --> 21:46.058
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

21:46.119 --> 21:47.325
Molly, not another word.

21:47.387 --> 21:49.526
BRISCOE: You can say
anything you want, Molly.

21:50.324 --> 21:52.133
I'm taking you home.

21:58.532 --> 22:01.513
BRISCOE: Her lawyer'd gotten stuck
in traffic, we'd have a confession.

22:01.568 --> 22:02.774
Has anyone talked to her son?

22:03.604 --> 22:04.674
Parents won't
make him available.

22:04.738 --> 22:07.378
There's gotta be something in what she
said to jump start a search warrant.

22:07.441 --> 22:10.081
I wouldn't go near a judge
with that crap.

22:10.143 --> 22:12.214
You told her we could arrest
her if she tried to leave?

22:12.279 --> 22:13.280
Who told you that?

22:13.347 --> 22:15.623
JACK: Besides the fact
that you lied to her,

22:15.682 --> 22:18.663
it takes it pretty damn close
to a custodial interrogation.

22:18.719 --> 22:21.893
We also told her she could
leave any time she wanted to.

22:21.955 --> 22:26.370
Please. This is not some dumb
gangbanger with a Legal Aid lawyer.

22:26.426 --> 22:28.337
Nice to see where
you draw the line.

22:28.395 --> 22:29.772
Hey.
Forget it, Rey.

22:29.830 --> 22:31.741
CURTIS: Hey, look, she
shoved a pair of scissors

22:31.798 --> 22:32.936
into this woman's chest.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.106
You want us to serve her tea cakes while
she makes up her mind to give it up?

22:36.169 --> 22:37.170
She was this close.

22:37.237 --> 22:39.308
Better she didn't confess.

22:39.373 --> 22:41.785
Saves us all from looking like
idiots when it gets tossed.

22:41.842 --> 22:43.515
Come on, Rey,
if she had given it up,

22:43.577 --> 22:46.148
he'd throw his shoulder out trying
to pat himself on the back.

22:46.213 --> 22:47.419
(DOOR OPENS)

22:48.982 --> 22:50.086
(DOOR CLOSES)

22:52.319 --> 22:54.299
It wasn't all a waste of time.

22:54.354 --> 22:55.628
She said something
about Burk knowing

22:55.689 --> 22:58.363
her husband was
lying about his money.

22:58.425 --> 23:01.099
Ex-wives always think their
husbands lie about money.

23:01.161 --> 23:03.971
And they're probably right.

23:04.031 --> 23:06.978
If he really had something to
hide, and somehow Burk knew,

23:07.267 --> 23:09.372
it pumps up
Molly Kilpatrick's motive.

23:10.170 --> 23:14.346
Or her husband's. Take
a look at his finances.

23:14.408 --> 23:16.615
We don't have enough to
subpoena them.

23:16.677 --> 23:20.147
Maybe this Sheila Atkins
can save you the trouble.

23:20.213 --> 23:23.387
I have 23 boxes full of
his financial records.

23:23.450 --> 23:24.758
Why should I give them to you?

23:24.818 --> 23:26.627
So you can use them
against my client?

23:26.687 --> 23:28.394
They might clear your client.

23:28.455 --> 23:30.765
We suspect Mr. Kilpatrick
might have killed Dr. Burk

23:30.891 --> 23:34.168
because she knew something
about his finances.

23:34.227 --> 23:36.036
Knew how?

23:36.096 --> 23:38.702
Your client seems
to think he told her.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.369
Maybe Mr. Kilpatrick
let his guard down

23:40.467 --> 23:43.243
during one of his
sessions with Dr. Burk.

23:43.303 --> 23:46.341
Ms. Ross, I think we can
work together on this.

23:47.474 --> 23:48.544
It's in your
client's interests.

23:48.609 --> 23:50.088
My client's interests
lie in proving

23:50.143 --> 23:52.680
that her husband and his lawyer
conspired to defraud her.

23:52.746 --> 23:54.316
Go on.
He's been hiding assets

23:54.381 --> 23:55.883
at the direction
of Mr. Redfield.

23:55.949 --> 23:56.984
You know this for a fact?

23:57.050 --> 24:00.827
I can't prove it to a
judge for a fact. Yet.

24:04.124 --> 24:06.263
Molly told me it was
possible that Dr. Burk knew.

24:06.326 --> 24:09.034
I wanted Dr. Burk
to go on the record.

24:11.164 --> 24:14.737
I'll have those files delivered to
your office by tomorrow morning.

24:16.002 --> 24:18.915
The forensic accountants think
Kilpatrick undervalued his company.

24:18.972 --> 24:21.418
He told the Family Court
it was worth a million-two.

24:21.475 --> 24:23.682
Atkins puts the number
closer to four.

24:23.744 --> 24:24.882
Wishful thinking?

24:24.945 --> 24:26.947
Our accountants feel
Atkins has a decent case.

24:27.013 --> 24:28.583
She's hoping
we can help her prove it.

24:28.649 --> 24:31.425
Oh, no. We're not getting
dragged into their divorce.

24:31.485 --> 24:34.694
Did the police happen
to ask Mr. Kilpatrick

24:34.755 --> 24:37.167
where he was
the night of the murder?

24:37.224 --> 24:39.101
No. They didn't
consider him a suspect.

24:39.159 --> 24:41.605
Well, we do.

24:43.897 --> 24:45.968
You want an alibi from him?

24:46.033 --> 24:47.137
If he has one.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.680
I don't like your tone.
Why is he a suspect?

24:49.736 --> 24:53.616
Sheila Atkins was going to depose
Dr. Burk about his finances.

24:53.673 --> 24:56.313
Our accountants went through
your records, Mr. Kilpatrick.

24:56.376 --> 24:58.481
I turned my books
inside-out for Molly.

24:58.545 --> 25:00.582
I haven't denied her anything
that's rightfully hers.

25:00.647 --> 25:03.287
This is another Sheila
Atkins fishing expedition.

25:03.350 --> 25:06.160
They're stalling the annulment in
order to extort money from him.

25:06.219 --> 25:10.531
Atkins telling her client there's a
pot of gold, when there's nothing.

25:10.590 --> 25:14.128
Mr. Kilpatrick, if you could
just answer my question.

25:16.063 --> 25:19.601
After I dropped my son off,
I went home to change,

25:19.666 --> 25:21.646
and then I met
a friend for drinks.

25:21.768 --> 25:22.838
About 9:30.

25:22.903 --> 25:24.473
I'll need your friend's
name and number.

25:24.538 --> 25:26.347
David Harrigan. Sure.

25:26.406 --> 25:28.579
I've seen Sheila Atkins
at work for 10 years.

25:28.642 --> 25:31.020
The woman ought to
have her license pulled.

25:31.077 --> 25:34.854
She has nice things to say
about you, too. Thank you.

25:36.883 --> 25:38.328
HARRIGAN: I had a crisis
with a Korean bank,

25:38.385 --> 25:43.664
so I got to the bar maybe 9:45.
Gary had started without me.

25:43.724 --> 25:45.567
How long had he been there?

25:45.625 --> 25:47.400
He was into his third Chivas.

25:47.461 --> 25:48.940
He wasn't wasting any time.

25:48.995 --> 25:51.999
Well, since the split-up...

25:52.065 --> 25:54.545
He says you're investigating
him about this murder.

25:54.601 --> 25:55.773
He called you?

25:55.836 --> 25:57.941
To give me a heads up, yeah.

25:58.004 --> 26:01.816
Don't worry, he didn't ask me to lie.
He knows me better than that.

26:01.875 --> 26:04.412
You don't sound convinced
he didn't do it.

26:04.878 --> 26:06.687
I believe he's innocent.

26:06.746 --> 26:08.487
That's not
a ringing endorsement.

26:08.982 --> 26:10.290
What about Molly?

26:11.952 --> 26:13.454
I've known them since college.

26:13.553 --> 26:14.588
I mean, their son and mine

26:14.654 --> 26:16.600
practically grew up together.

26:16.656 --> 26:19.068
Gary and Molly
were decent people.

26:19.125 --> 26:21.298
Even the divorce
started out friendly.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.965
Then the lawyers
got hold of them.

26:25.031 --> 26:27.534
Hyenas have better manners.

26:27.601 --> 26:30.207
I just worry what it's
done to their son, Billy.

26:30.270 --> 26:31.476
Do you talk to him?

26:31.538 --> 26:33.381
Well, he's been staying
with us since a few days ago.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.851
Why is that?

26:34.908 --> 26:37.514
Something to do with his mother.
I don't know what.

26:37.577 --> 26:39.682
He just needs a time-out.

26:39.746 --> 26:41.953
Do you mind if I talk to him?

26:43.583 --> 26:46.757
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to, Billy.

26:47.654 --> 26:48.758
(SIGHS)

26:48.822 --> 26:51.200
It's just the stuff at home.

26:51.258 --> 26:52.999
With my mother.

26:53.660 --> 26:55.537
With her pills and all that.

26:56.296 --> 26:57.639
She cries a lot.

26:58.532 --> 27:00.671
ROSS:
She's not in good shape.

27:01.601 --> 27:04.377
Like the night she tried
to take you out of practice.

27:06.172 --> 27:07.344
What happened
when you got home?

27:07.407 --> 27:10.479
I'm sick of everybody
asking me that.

27:10.544 --> 27:11.852
Who else asked?

27:11.912 --> 27:14.119
Dad's lawyer, and Mom's.

27:14.180 --> 27:16.421
She told me not to talk
about it with anybody.

27:16.483 --> 27:18.724
Ms. Atkins?
Do you trust her?

27:22.455 --> 27:25.459
Billy, did your mom tell you to take
a cab home from practice that night?

27:27.661 --> 27:30.267
HARRIGAN: You should tell
her the truth, Billy.

27:31.831 --> 27:35.472
(SIGHS) She was
supposed to pick me up.

27:36.136 --> 27:38.241
I called her.
She didn't answer.

27:38.305 --> 27:40.615
ROSS: Was she there
when you got home?

27:40.674 --> 27:42.381
Her door was closed.
She was sleeping.

27:42.842 --> 27:44.219
Did you see her or hear her?

27:46.346 --> 27:47.848
Did you knock on the door?
BILLY: No.

27:47.914 --> 27:49.757
I went to my room
and watched videos.

27:50.417 --> 27:52.192
So, she still
could have been asleep.

27:53.053 --> 27:58.230
Uncle David, I don't
think she was there.

27:59.392 --> 28:01.372
I heard her phone ring
in her room.

28:01.761 --> 28:03.365
She never answered it.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.870
Her own son isn't
supporting her alibi.

28:08.935 --> 28:10.471
She was halfway to a
confession a week ago.

28:10.537 --> 28:13.211
She's popping pills, crying
herself to sleep at night?

28:13.273 --> 28:17.153
Arresting her might push
her the rest of the way.

28:17.210 --> 28:20.555
Pick her up. Get warrants
for her home and office.

28:20.613 --> 28:22.957
Better put her
on suicide watch.

28:26.386 --> 28:29.299
Half a million dollars bail?
It's utterly punitive.

28:29.356 --> 28:31.802
If it keeps her where she
can't hurt herself or others.

28:31.858 --> 28:33.462
You know, that's
a very benign view

28:33.526 --> 28:35.062
of imprisonment
before conviction.

28:35.128 --> 28:37.267
I don't see a strong case here.

28:37.330 --> 28:38.707
I don't see a case here at all.

28:38.765 --> 28:40.836
Nothing specifically
contradicts her alibi,

28:40.900 --> 28:42.971
and nothing directly
connects her to the crime.

28:43.036 --> 28:46.381
So far, carpet fibers from the victim's
office have turned up at her house

28:46.439 --> 28:48.385
and hair matching hers
was found at the crime scene.

28:48.441 --> 28:51.081
BEHRENS: All of which can
be explained innocently.

28:51.144 --> 28:53.317
All we need is a speck of blood
where it doesn't belong.

28:53.380 --> 28:56.657
I didn't kill her.
Why don't you believe me?

28:56.716 --> 28:58.423
Molly, please
let me handle this.

28:58.485 --> 29:01.159
Are you putting Mr. Kilpatrick
under the same microscope?

29:01.221 --> 29:03.132
His alibi can be corroborated.

29:03.189 --> 29:04.896
By David Harrigan?

29:04.958 --> 29:06.904
Before you take his
testimony at face value,

29:06.960 --> 29:08.462
look at his banking practices.

29:08.528 --> 29:10.007
Yeah, well, look, we're not
going to settle this today.

29:10.063 --> 29:12.065
Let's talk about chopping
this bail in half.

29:12.132 --> 29:14.510
Out of the question. Now, if
you want to talk about a plea.

29:14.567 --> 29:16.240
BEHRENS:
With what you've got?

29:16.303 --> 29:19.750
Given her state of mind, we're
willing to go to man one.

29:19.806 --> 29:22.309
That's a minimum of
eight years in prison,

29:22.375 --> 29:24.981
Mrs. Kilpatrick,
instead of 25,

29:25.278 --> 29:27.087
if you're convicted
of second-degree murder.

29:27.147 --> 29:29.787
You'll get laughed out
of the grand jury first.

29:29.849 --> 29:31.851
We're done here. Come on.

29:34.287 --> 29:36.062
And I used to think
my divorce was rough.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.567
Look where you
could have ended up.

29:37.624 --> 29:40.104
My murder fantasies
don't include getting caught.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.868
Ms. Ross, Mr. McCoy,

29:42.929 --> 29:45.739
between you and me,
Mr. Behrens blew it.

29:45.799 --> 29:47.005
Only if your client's guilty.

29:47.067 --> 29:48.205
I'm not conceding anything.

29:48.268 --> 29:52.011
But I don't see things looking
up for Molly anytime soon.

29:52.072 --> 29:53.676
What are you proposing?

29:53.740 --> 29:55.447
Whatever's best for her.

29:55.508 --> 29:58.455
Does your offer of man one come
with a sentence recommendation?

29:58.511 --> 29:59.717
Give me a number.

30:00.246 --> 30:02.487
(SIGHS) Molly listens to me.

30:02.549 --> 30:04.688
I'll get back to you
in a few days.

30:04.751 --> 30:06.196
(DOOR BUZZING OPEN)

30:09.122 --> 30:11.966
Yeah, I'll let him know.
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

30:15.795 --> 30:20.073
Atkins. She had her halfway there,
until Behrens got wind of it.

30:20.133 --> 30:21.976
Nice try.
She'll take another run at it

30:22.035 --> 30:23.343
once we get an indictment.

30:23.403 --> 30:25.474
All our adversaries
should be this accommodating.

30:25.538 --> 30:27.609
Or pragmatic.

30:27.674 --> 30:30.211
Addressed to me,
belongs to you.

30:32.812 --> 30:35.122
From the Bar Association
Ethics Committee.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.457
Dues check bounced?

30:37.517 --> 30:40.930
They're requesting copies of
all non-confidential documents

30:40.987 --> 30:42.728
held by the District
Attorney's Office

30:42.789 --> 30:45.235
in People v.
Molly Kilpatrick.

30:49.362 --> 30:51.171
This case hasn't even gone
to the grand jury yet

30:51.231 --> 30:52.869
and already
there's an ethics problem?

30:52.932 --> 30:55.435
Jamie, I'm not supposed
to discuss pending matters.

30:55.502 --> 30:57.345
Don't send me back to
Jack McCoy empty-handed.

30:57.404 --> 30:58.747
You know what a hard ass he is.

30:58.805 --> 31:01.547
Yeah.
He seeing anybody?

31:01.608 --> 31:02.848
You want an introduction?

31:02.909 --> 31:04.388
Sure.

31:04.444 --> 31:06.424
Tell you what else
you can do for me.

31:06.479 --> 31:07.651
Give up a Saturday to work

31:07.714 --> 31:10.627
with my high school mock
trial team at St. Joseph's.

31:10.683 --> 31:13.323
Sure. I'll teach them
to spell quid pro quo.

31:13.386 --> 31:14.490
(CHUCKLES)

31:15.889 --> 31:17.527
Sheila Atkins
came to the committee

31:17.590 --> 31:20.093
for an advisory opinion
on a privilege issue.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.969
That's all I can say.

31:23.930 --> 31:26.103
It's got to be about something
Molly Kilpatrick told her.

31:26.165 --> 31:28.577
An incriminating statement
that might not be privileged.

31:28.635 --> 31:32.310
That explains why Ms. Atkins
was pushing for a plea.

31:32.372 --> 31:36.047
If it's not privileged, she
has a duty to come forward.

31:36.109 --> 31:37.520
She's obviously
struggling with it.

31:37.577 --> 31:39.056
Why else go to
the Ethics Committee?

31:39.112 --> 31:40.989
Whatever they tell her, she's
not bound by their decision.

31:41.047 --> 31:42.253
It has no force of law.

31:42.315 --> 31:45.125
Any new evidence
against Mrs. Kilpatrick?

31:45.185 --> 31:47.028
Nothing new from Forensics.

31:47.087 --> 31:49.966
Yeah, well, then
it's up to Ms. Atkins.

31:50.023 --> 31:55.097
If she can't bring herself to do
the right thing, we got a problem.

31:55.161 --> 31:58.301
Exactly what ethical dilemma
am I struggling with?

31:58.364 --> 32:00.708
An issue of privilege
regarding Molly Kilpatrick.

32:00.767 --> 32:03.008
We know you went to
the Ethics Committee.

32:03.069 --> 32:04.912
Somebody has a big mouth.

32:04.971 --> 32:07.383
Would you mind getting out
of my way? They can't see me.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.420
The Committee asked
us for documentation.

32:09.476 --> 32:11.080
This can't come
as a surprise to you.

32:11.144 --> 32:13.647
We appreciate you take the
canons of ethics seriously.

32:13.713 --> 32:15.215
We hope we don't
have to compel you

32:15.281 --> 32:16.954
to disclose what
your client told you.

32:17.016 --> 32:19.553
I don't have anything
to say to you.

32:20.587 --> 32:24.967
You have until tomorrow
morning, or we go to the judge.

32:25.024 --> 32:27.834
Don't wait up for me.
And thank you.

32:33.066 --> 32:34.409
This motion's
an egregious attempt

32:34.467 --> 32:36.378
to intrude on the
attorney-client relationship.

32:36.436 --> 32:37.779
And for all
Mr. McCoy knows,

32:37.837 --> 32:41.080
the information he's trying to wring
out of Ms. Atkins is irrelevant.

32:41.140 --> 32:43.347
Mr. McCoy, you have any
idea what you're after?

32:43.710 --> 32:44.848
I can only speculate.

32:44.911 --> 32:46.322
Speculate out loud.

32:47.914 --> 32:50.588
Solicitation by a client
for help in a cover-up.

32:51.684 --> 32:54.824
A statement by a client that he
or she intends to commit a crime,

32:55.054 --> 32:56.829
or offer perjured testimony.

32:56.890 --> 32:58.369
Is he in the ballpark,
Ms. Atkins?

32:58.424 --> 33:00.426
I'm not conceding that
my client said anything.

33:00.493 --> 33:02.473
You didn't call the Ethics
Committee for cooking tips.

33:02.529 --> 33:03.735
That's between
her and the Committee.

33:03.796 --> 33:04.797
JACK: And this court.

33:05.064 --> 33:07.271
Your Honor, you have the
authority to compel her to talk.

33:07.333 --> 33:08.641
Thank you, Mr. McCoy.

33:09.802 --> 33:12.043
Ms. Atkins, you and I are going
to have a chat in camera.

33:12.438 --> 33:14.611
The rest of you
can wait outside.

33:17.911 --> 33:20.391
Divorce lawyers wrestling
with their conscience.

33:20.446 --> 33:23.859
What's next? Plumbers
who don't pad their bills?

33:23.917 --> 33:26.796
If my gut's right, you might
start thinking about a plea.

33:28.554 --> 33:30.693
The Judge wants you back in.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.798
Back on the record.

33:35.862 --> 33:40.277
Ms. Atkins has informed me of
Mrs. Kilpatrick's statements.

33:40.333 --> 33:43.837
In light of the canons of ethics
and the relevant case law,

33:43.903 --> 33:45.541
the statements
are not protected

33:45.605 --> 33:48.586
by the client-attorney
privilege.

33:48.641 --> 33:52.020
Ms. Atkins has a duty to divulge
them to the District Attorney.

33:52.078 --> 33:55.491
The People's motions
to compel are granted.

33:55.548 --> 33:56.720
Let's hear it, Ms. Atkins.

33:56.783 --> 33:59.559
Not until you and I reach
an agreement.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.755
Your Honor?

34:01.821 --> 34:03.459
Ms. Atkins, you can
be held in contempt.

34:03.523 --> 34:04.797
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

34:04.857 --> 34:06.359
Molly Kilpatrick
is still my client,

34:06.426 --> 34:08.632
and I still represent
her interests.

34:08.695 --> 34:11.402
First, they agree to a minimum
sentence on a plea of man one.

34:11.464 --> 34:12.498
Three-to-six?

34:12.565 --> 34:13.668
Then they issue subpoenas

34:13.733 --> 34:16.145
for accounts held by Paul
Redfield in the Virgin Islands.

34:16.202 --> 34:18.409
I don't understand.
Who's Mr. Redfield?

34:18.471 --> 34:20.109
He represents my
client's ex-husband.

34:20.172 --> 34:24.246
I intend to prove that he and Mr. Kilpatrick
conspired to hide assets from her.

34:24.310 --> 34:26.813
You don't need our help. You
can get your own subpoenas.

34:26.879 --> 34:27.949
Family Court turned me down.

34:28.014 --> 34:29.186
This is a civil matter.

34:29.248 --> 34:31.092
Even if we wanted to, we
don't have the authority.

34:31.150 --> 34:34.154
You can if you open a tax fraud
investigation into Mr. Kilpatrick.

34:34.786 --> 34:37.460
Sooner or later,
my client will be out of jail,

34:37.523 --> 34:39.696
and I'm committed to seeing
that she's provided for.

34:39.759 --> 34:41.705
That she gets every last
dime she's entitled to.

34:41.761 --> 34:43.967
DERRICK: That's all fine
and good, Ms. Atkins.

34:44.030 --> 34:47.534
But you have 48 hours
to answer Mr. McCoy,

34:47.600 --> 34:48.943
or I'll hold you in contempt.

34:53.306 --> 34:54.512
Heck of a lawyer.

34:54.574 --> 34:57.612
She's using us to grind
Redfield's face into the ground.

34:57.677 --> 35:00.783
If he committed fraud, it
wouldn't be a waste of our time.

35:00.847 --> 35:02.224
I don't like to be manipulated.

35:02.281 --> 35:06.161
All of a sudden you don't need Ms. Atkins'
testimony to convict her client?

35:06.219 --> 35:08.995
Six months in Rikers for contempt
will compel her testimony.

35:09.289 --> 35:10.324
You hope.

35:10.390 --> 35:12.199
Her client is guilty of murder.

35:12.258 --> 35:14.363
We're supposed to let
her off with three years

35:14.427 --> 35:16.668
and help her gouge
her husband for alimony?

35:16.763 --> 35:18.709
You'll get over it.

35:19.699 --> 35:23.408
We've decided to
accept Ms. Atkins' terms.

35:23.469 --> 35:25.005
We've opened an investigation

35:25.071 --> 35:27.881
into Messrs. Redfield
and Kilpatrick,

35:27.940 --> 35:30.614
and we'll make a sentence
recommendation for Mrs. Kilpatrick.

35:30.676 --> 35:33.054
I don't understand
what's going on here.

35:33.112 --> 35:34.557
ROSS: Didn't Mr. Behrens
explain it to you?

35:34.614 --> 35:36.787
Yes, but I didn't kill Dr. Burk.

35:36.849 --> 35:40.058
Molly, it's best we
just listen for now.

35:43.256 --> 35:45.361
You're up, Ms. Atkins.

35:45.425 --> 35:48.531
I'm sorry, Molly.
They're forcing me to do this.

35:52.398 --> 35:56.039
You have to understand that Molly
was driven to it by her husband.

35:56.102 --> 35:59.572
By his lawyer's
unconscionable tactics.

35:59.639 --> 36:02.677
If it weren't for them, she
wouldn't be on medication.

36:02.742 --> 36:04.722
She wouldn't be here.

36:06.245 --> 36:09.488
When she came to my office on
Tuesday, she was beside herself.

36:09.549 --> 36:12.689
She was fixated
on the annulment.

36:12.752 --> 36:15.699
She felt that the church
and Dr. Burk, in particular,

36:15.755 --> 36:18.167
were aligned against her.

36:19.158 --> 36:24.972
She said, "I'll kill her, if that's
what it takes to change her mind."

36:25.064 --> 36:27.271
No, Sheila! Why are
you telling them this?

36:27.333 --> 36:28.641
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36:28.701 --> 36:29.873
No, I didn't say that.

36:29.936 --> 36:31.244
I couldn't.
You'd taken a lot of pills.

36:31.304 --> 36:33.409
You didn't know
what you were saying.

36:33.473 --> 36:34.747
I never thought
you'd go through with it.

36:34.807 --> 36:36.787
MOLLY: (SOBBING) No.

36:37.443 --> 36:39.855
It can't be true.

36:42.915 --> 36:45.691
Please. Oh, God.

36:46.919 --> 36:48.057
Three-to-six,
is that right?

36:49.889 --> 36:52.870
Contingent on a
psychiatric evaluation?

36:54.393 --> 36:56.395
Come on, Molly. Come on.

37:05.605 --> 37:08.176
Grand jury subpoenas?
Bank examiners?

37:08.241 --> 37:09.914
I can't believe she
talked you into this.

37:10.510 --> 37:12.285
If you have nothing to hide,
why jump all over us?

37:12.345 --> 37:14.484
Because I don't think that the
District Attorney's office

37:14.547 --> 37:16.527
should be a patsy
for Sheila Atkins'

37:16.582 --> 37:18.323
malicious campaign
of harassment.

37:18.384 --> 37:19.385
Don't be paranoid.

37:19.452 --> 37:22.399
She simply alleged what our forensic
accountants already suspected.

37:22.455 --> 37:25.834
Paranoid? This is what
I've received from her

37:25.892 --> 37:27.701
just within
the past three months.

37:27.760 --> 37:33.142
Interrogatories, motions for legal
fees, frivolous criminal complaints.

37:33.199 --> 37:35.736
I've got a whole room in my
office filled with her crap.

37:35.802 --> 37:38.339
It's attrition, not litigation.

37:38.404 --> 37:42.352
You take a look at that, and then
you tell me if I'm paranoid.

37:44.811 --> 37:45.983
(DOOR OPENS)

37:46.145 --> 37:47.419
Sore loser.

37:48.448 --> 37:50.985
The divorce was finalized
four months ago.

37:51.050 --> 37:52.529
What's she hope
to gain from this?

37:52.785 --> 37:54.230
It does seem like overkill.

37:54.287 --> 37:56.699
I'm surprised
nobody's reined her in.

37:58.091 --> 38:01.004
Go back to the Ethics
Committee. Check her out.

38:01.060 --> 38:03.062
She's our star witness
against Molly Kilpatrick.

38:03.129 --> 38:05.075
I'd like to know
what we're dealing with.

38:07.967 --> 38:09.275
Hey.

38:10.036 --> 38:12.607
I'm thinking of buying it.
It's an antique.

38:12.672 --> 38:15.676
Aren't motorcycles supposed
to have wheels and an engine?

38:16.509 --> 38:19.456
Atkins' rap sheet
from the Ethics Committee.

38:21.247 --> 38:22.920
Allegations of
conflict of interest,

38:22.982 --> 38:25.986
comingling funds,
courtroom misconduct.

38:26.052 --> 38:29.556
Looks like she never met an ethical
violation she didn't like.

38:29.622 --> 38:32.193
Most of the complaints were
filed by Paul Redfield.

38:32.258 --> 38:35.330
Which is only fair, since she filed an
equal number of complaints against him.

38:36.329 --> 38:37.967
What's the matter with
those two?

38:38.030 --> 38:42.103
It's the adversarial system on steroids.
It gets stranger.

38:42.168 --> 38:44.273
I looked through the papers
Redfield left behind.

38:44.337 --> 38:47.409
It's a notice of a petition
for a preliminary injunction.

38:47.473 --> 38:49.714
Atkins wanted to
enjoin the Archdiocese

38:49.776 --> 38:51.517
from proceeding
with the annulment.

38:51.577 --> 38:54.649
Enjoin the Archdiocese?
Who's she kidding?

38:55.414 --> 38:56.950
She had a hearing scheduled
with Judge Kaufer

38:57.016 --> 38:58.461
the Friday after
Linda Burk's death.

38:59.018 --> 39:00.326
And?
I don't know.

39:00.386 --> 39:02.923
I've got a call in
to Kaufer's clerk.

39:03.823 --> 39:05.632
Enjoining the Catholic church.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.136
I thought
it was a non-starter.

39:07.193 --> 39:09.002
First Amendment, separation
of church and state.

39:09.061 --> 39:11.234
I'm surprised Judge Kaufer
even scheduled a hearing.

39:11.297 --> 39:12.537
You'll be more
surprised to learn

39:12.598 --> 39:15.204
there's actual
case law on this.

39:15.268 --> 39:17.373
Ms. Atkins wasn't completely
out in left field.

39:17.436 --> 39:18.779
Her petition had merit?

39:19.038 --> 39:22.850
Her brief argued the annulment
had civil repercussions.

39:22.908 --> 39:25.650
Namely, the illegitimacy
of Mrs. Kilpatrick's son,

39:25.711 --> 39:28.487
which can be held to be defaming
and injurious to someone

39:28.548 --> 39:32.052
who's not a party to the
ecclesiastic proceedings.

39:32.118 --> 39:34.029
She even quoted Blackstone.

39:34.086 --> 39:35.622
JACK: How did
Judge Kaufer rule?

39:36.022 --> 39:38.798
If Ms. Atkins hadn't withdrawn
her petition, I could tell you.

39:39.759 --> 39:40.999
When did she do that?

39:41.360 --> 39:42.839
The day before the hearing.

39:46.532 --> 39:48.705
All right, Ms. Jones.
Thank you.

39:57.043 --> 39:58.488
(DOOR CLOSES)

39:59.111 --> 40:00.954
Son of a bitch.

40:03.549 --> 40:08.020
She withdrew her petition right after
the murder because it was moot.

40:08.087 --> 40:10.089
Because she knew
Burk's evaluation

40:10.156 --> 40:12.762
had been destroyed,
because she did it.

40:13.726 --> 40:15.865
She knew the annulment
would be stalled.

40:15.928 --> 40:18.306
Maybe she knew because
Molly Kilpatrick told her.

40:18.364 --> 40:20.605
Then why didn't Atkins tell us?

40:22.201 --> 40:23.874
She killed Burk, Jamie.

40:24.236 --> 40:27.012
That whole business
with the Ethics Committee.

40:27.073 --> 40:30.418
We were conned.
She framed her own client.

40:30.476 --> 40:32.387
She withdrew a petition
two days after a killing.

40:32.445 --> 40:35.221
It's not much to hang
a murder charge on.

40:35.281 --> 40:38.728
She talked an innocent woman
into three years in jail.

40:41.020 --> 40:44.194
Maybe she'll talk herself
into 25-to-life.

40:44.891 --> 40:46.871
Call her friend, Paul Redfield.

40:50.630 --> 40:53.577
I took the liberty of
sketching out an agreement.

40:53.633 --> 40:56.204
You'll see that it covers what
we discussed on the phone,

40:56.268 --> 40:58.475
Kilpatrick puts a
million-five on the table,

40:58.537 --> 41:00.244
my client signs off
on the annulment.

41:00.306 --> 41:01.410
She's agreed?

41:01.474 --> 41:03.351
My clients listen to me, Paul.

41:03.409 --> 41:06.185
And I'll tell McCoy that we're
withdrawing the fraud complaint.

41:06.779 --> 41:10.090
<i>REDFIELD: That might not be
enough to get him off my back</i>

41:10.149 --> 41:12.129
Molly and I don't testify,
he doesn't have a case.

41:12.184 --> 41:13.788
The little twerp can pound
his desk all he wants.

41:14.086 --> 41:15.224
It doesn't matter.

41:15.288 --> 41:16.892
You must have
gone back for seconds

41:16.956 --> 41:19.402
when they handed out
the brass ones, Sheila.

41:19.458 --> 41:20.937
Mmm.

41:20.993 --> 41:22.973
It took you two-and-a-half
years to cry uncle, Paul.

41:23.028 --> 41:24.029
I never thought I'd hear it.

41:24.096 --> 41:27.202
Your client's going to prison, and
you're doing a victory dance.

41:27.266 --> 41:28.267
Why shouldn't I?

41:28.467 --> 41:32.210
I earn my fees in divorce court.
Criminal law is not my bag.

41:33.172 --> 41:34.276
So, do we have a deal?

41:34.340 --> 41:35.375
I tell you what, Sheila.

41:35.441 --> 41:38.786
I like everything about it
except the million-five.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.688
Let me propose another figure.
Zero.

41:42.348 --> 41:43.884
What the hell are
you talking about?

41:45.584 --> 41:47.586
I found this in my file.

41:49.121 --> 41:52.534
Your petition for an injunction
against the Archdiocese.

41:53.059 --> 41:54.834
It looked so promising.

41:54.894 --> 41:58.034
I called Judge Kaufer's clerk to
find out what happened to it.

41:58.097 --> 41:59.838
Imagine my surprise

41:59.899 --> 42:03.938
when I was told that you withdrew
it two days after Burk was killed.

42:04.837 --> 42:06.214
Of course.
Without her report,

42:06.272 --> 42:07.842
the annulment is
dead in its tracks.

42:07.907 --> 42:10.148
REDFIELD: Nobody knew
the report was erased

42:10.209 --> 42:13.213
except the person who
erased it.

42:13.279 --> 42:14.849
That would be you, Sheila.

42:16.182 --> 42:17.752
(EXCLAIMS)

42:19.352 --> 42:21.491
Did somebody put drugs
in your protein shake?

42:21.554 --> 42:24.160
Fine. I'll just walk this
over to One Hogan Place,

42:24.223 --> 42:26.965
and see what
McCoy makes out of it.

42:27.026 --> 42:31.065
Or you get your client to consent
to the annulment for no money,

42:31.130 --> 42:33.269
and you withdraw
the fraud complaint.

42:33.332 --> 42:34.902
You bastard.
I had you beat.

42:34.967 --> 42:36.469
In your dreams.

42:36.535 --> 42:38.913
I beat you on child support,
on visitations.

42:38.971 --> 42:40.211
One extra dinner a month.

42:40.272 --> 42:41.945
Kilpatrick had to double
her clothing allowance.

42:42.008 --> 42:43.510
He was planning
to do that anyway.

42:43.576 --> 42:45.385
You just can't stand to lose.

42:45.444 --> 42:46.684
ATKINS: And you know
exactly how to lose.

42:46.745 --> 42:47.780
You're an expert at it.

42:47.847 --> 42:48.882
They're worse than my kids.

42:48.948 --> 42:51.053
You're gonna get a crash
course in losing,

42:51.116 --> 42:53.323
'cause you're going
to prison for murder.

42:53.385 --> 42:56.423
I'm taking this to McCoy.

42:56.489 --> 42:58.730
Paul, all right, you win.

42:58.791 --> 43:00.202
You'll have her
consent tomorrow.

43:00.259 --> 43:01.636
Just don't do anything stupid.

43:02.161 --> 43:03.367
Please.

43:14.206 --> 43:15.344
Ms. Atkins.

43:15.408 --> 43:16.512
What is this?

43:16.575 --> 43:17.645
Turn around, please.
What are you doing?

43:17.710 --> 43:19.246
You're under arrest for murder.

43:19.311 --> 43:22.588
Better start making criminal
law your bag, Ms. Atkins.

43:22.648 --> 43:23.854
CURTIS: You have the
right to remain silent.

43:23.916 --> 43:26.624
Anything you say
can and will be used...

43:32.024 --> 43:34.732
ATKINS: I'm convinced that he was
hiding money from my client,

43:34.793 --> 43:37.740
and the annulment was the
only leverage I had left.

43:37.796 --> 43:40.572
I practically begged Dr. Burk
to reconsider her evaluation,

43:40.633 --> 43:44.547
even just to delay it for a
few weeks, and she refused.

43:47.172 --> 43:48.947
I was furious.

43:49.008 --> 43:52.478
After two-and-a-half years,
to think that I could lose.

43:53.412 --> 43:58.987
And we struggled, and I stabbed
her with a pair of scissors,

43:59.051 --> 44:02.589
and then I erased the
report from her computer.

44:04.156 --> 44:09.003
And your statements to the District
Attorney regarding Mrs. Kilpatrick?

44:11.030 --> 44:12.031
I lied.

44:13.833 --> 44:15.574
And I apologize to her.

44:16.869 --> 44:18.109
She trusted me with everything.

44:18.170 --> 44:21.344
She gave me a free hand
in how I handled her divorce.

44:21.407 --> 44:24.388
I tried to defend her
rights as...

44:25.678 --> 44:27.555
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

44:28.013 --> 44:31.654
You killed my wife to win a
divorce case, and you're sorry!

44:31.717 --> 44:32.752
(GAVEL POUNDS)

44:40.559 --> 44:43.972
GANCE: Mr. McCoy,
are the People satisfied?

44:49.401 --> 44:50.436
We are, Your Honor.

44:53.239 --> 44:56.709
Sheila Atkins,
pursuant to your plea

44:56.776 --> 44:58.778
of Murder in the Second Degree

44:59.144 --> 45:02.182
and the recommendation of the
District Attorney's Office,

45:02.248 --> 45:07.129
you are hereby sentenced to a
term of no less than 15 years

45:07.186 --> 45:10.360
and no more than the term
of your natural life

45:10.422 --> 45:12.333
in a facility to be determined

45:12.391 --> 45:14.337
by the
Department of Correction.

45:15.761 --> 45:17.365
We're adjourned.
(GAVEL POUNDS)

45:28.908 --> 45:32.014
Redfield agreed to full restitution
of the missing assets,

45:32.077 --> 45:34.717
and he gets off with having his
license pulled for three years.

45:34.780 --> 45:36.657
He'll probably
count this as a win.

45:36.715 --> 45:40.754
He can drive up to Bedford
and crow to Atkins about it.

45:40.819 --> 45:43.561
Where on earth did these
people learn their ethics?

45:43.622 --> 45:44.657
