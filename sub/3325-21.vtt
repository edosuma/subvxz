WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.242
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.420 --> 00:03.284
Why you putting him in here?

00:03.463 --> 00:05.795
I saw an MRI
that looked exactly like my wife's.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.167
And it ferrifies me.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.002
- This is him.
- The Nogi’rsune?

00:09.177 --> 00:10.713
- Recognize them?
- One of them.

00:10.928 --> 00:14.512
The Nogitsune feeds oft
chaos, strife, and pain.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.432
You know me.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.013
If the oni can't defeat you,
I know someone who will.

00:32.992 --> 00:35.574
There's an answer, I swear.
Come on, just try.

00:35.745 --> 00:37.201
What gets broken without being held?

00:37.413 --> 00:38.448
I don't care.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.123
A promise. Get it?

00:43.336 --> 00:45.418
No, I don't. It's stupid.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.996
It's not funny. None of this is funny.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.085
What has teeth but doesn't bite?

00:54.305 --> 00:55.966
- Will you shut up already?
- Come on. This one's good.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.755
What has teeth but doesn't bite?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.601
- A comb.
- These jokes are stupid.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.394
They're not jokes, idiot. They're riddles.

01:04.607 --> 01:06.939
My girl back home loves them.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.981
What has a neck, but no head?

01:11.155 --> 01:12.110
Your mother.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.610
A bottle.

01:17.453 --> 01:18.442
What the hell.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.974
What has a neck but no head?

03:02.433 --> 03:04.014
Coming in on a Saturday.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.013
That's dedication.

03:08.898 --> 03:09.933
Where's she hiding them?

03:10.149 --> 03:12.185
I'm sorry,
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.017
Her little knives.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.395
Daggers.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.027
I know what they are.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.082
Physical representation of her tails.

03:35.591 --> 03:36.876
However the hell that works.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.629
Maybe you'd like to do some reading on it.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.506
I can direct you to the section
on Japanese myth in the library.

03:42.598 --> 03:46.011
No. No, I'd like to talk to you.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.770
The older the tail, the stronger the oni.

03:52.358 --> 03:55.600
Am I right? I know there's one left.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.686
I know it's the strongest.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.697
Unfortunately, I don't know
what you're referring to.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.025
You'll talk.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.010
They always talk.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.883
This looks just like me.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.477
- This has to be my grandmother.
- You remember I told you about Malia?

04:32.690 --> 04:34.806
She's the last one who saw
Stiles at Eichen House.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.062
This picture and this.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.362
They found it with a body buried in a wall.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.072
The same backwards five
that the oni put on us

04:44.285 --> 04:45.570
was on the wall.

04:47.163 --> 04:49.199
It sounds like it all goes back
to your family.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.326
Your grandmother, your mom.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.245
- What is it?
- My dad.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.011
Kira, did you bring it?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.723
- You going to tell me what it is?
- Reishi.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.926
You're not seriously giving
Dad magic mushrooms?

05:25.618 --> 05:27.199
Are you okay?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.325
Stiles did this?

05:33.417 --> 05:35.282
He wanted the last kaiken.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.287
I've kept this near me
ever since your friend disappeared.

05:39.632 --> 05:42.999
Mom, you need to talk to us,
about everything.

05:51.769 --> 05:53.054
Where did you get this?

05:53.979 --> 05:55.264
Is it Grandma?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.059
No.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.524
It's me.

06:08.828 --> 06:10.364
Hayes, a little help here.

06:12.081 --> 06:13.196
Hayeﬂ

06:13.874 --> 06:15.410
Merrick, what did you say the count was?

06:15.626 --> 06:16.832
Five.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.457
Five crates apples.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.038
There's only three left here.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.002
Okay, four crates apples.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.214
Hayes, come on!

06:38.023 --> 06:40.435
If that's you,
then you'd have to be like 90 years old.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.975
Closer to 900.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.145
Okay, sure. Why not?

06:47.157 --> 06:48.658
Dad, how old are you?

06:48.826 --> 06:49.861
43.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.527
But I've been told I look mid-30s.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.559
The blade was shattered
the last time it was used.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.309
When was that?

07:19.815 --> 07:20.975
1943.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.144
Against a nogitsune.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.814
All this, it's all happened before, hasn't it?

07:27.406 --> 07:28.395
Yes.

07:28.908 --> 07:31.991
Those who cannot remember the past
are condemned to repeat it.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.863
Where did it come from?

07:34.079 --> 07:36.821
It was an internment
camp during World War II.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.578
In Oak Creek. Not too far from here.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.754
Hold on. You told Allison and Isaac

07:42.963 --> 07:44.874
that there was
no internment camp at Oak Creek.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.756
Allison's family has
a certain history of violence.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.833
I didn't know if she could be trusted.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.965
There was a camp, yes.

07:52.181 --> 07:53.762
But all the records were erased.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.214
They covered it up.

07:57.436 --> 07:59.472
When I was a grad student,

07:59.647 --> 08:01.308
my passion project,

08:01.523 --> 08:03.650
actually more like an obsession,

08:03.943 --> 08:06.730
was trying to dig up
the truth on Oak Creek.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.820
It's how I met your mother, Kira.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.702
So, where did the nogitsune come from?

08:20.918 --> 08:22.624
Isn't it obvious yet?

08:24.630 --> 08:26.166
It came from me.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.606
Guys, keep your voices down.

08:53.826 --> 08:56.488
There's plenty for everyone.
But if the MPs hear, no one gets anything.

08:58.038 --> 08:58.993
Michio.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.583
A baseball, Noshiko?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.792
Did you manage to steal any firecrackers?
A machine gun maybe?

09:14.388 --> 09:17.255
I can feel your glare
on the back of my head, Satomi.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.436
You take too frequently.
And you take too much.

09:25.733 --> 09:26.973
Should I give some back?

09:32.031 --> 09:34.568
I know you get
migraines at least once a month.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.778
I prefer to suffer.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.748
I know what you think of me, Noshiko.

09:49.048 --> 09:52.006
You think I am weak
because I follow the rules.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.926
You think rules are
for the obedience of fools and cowards.

09:56.472 --> 10:00.681
The young fox always
knows the rules so she can break them.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.176
The older, wiser animal

10:03.771 --> 10:07.184
learns the exceptions to the rules.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.989
Listen, you two,
all we have to do is stay quiet.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.372
Michio, get back.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.580
What the hell was that?

10:29.755 --> 10:31.336
The MPs are coming.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.811
Somebody lose something?

10:53.362 --> 10:55.853
There were supplies
stolen off the truck last night.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.524
Anybody here got
any ideas what happened?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.957
- Merrick.
- Just doing my patriotic duty, Corporal.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.754
I want that window fixed.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.840
There'll be an inspection in the morning.

11:17.052 --> 11:19.213
We better not
find anything that shouldn't be here.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.720
- We're not gonna look now?
- Inspection in the morning.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.101
This is a relocation center. Not a prison.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.767
You can call it a summer camp
if it makes you feel better.

11:28.689 --> 11:29.849
Sir.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.494
Or as the Americans say,

11:55.716 --> 11:58.298
you reap what you sow.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.599
Kira, I need your help on this.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.312
There isn't much time.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.728
And this is something
that needs to be done in the daylight.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.810
Not until you tell us everything.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.607
Tell them, Noshiko.
Tell them what they need to know.

12:20.908 --> 12:24.651
Wolves and foxes tend not to get along.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.826
Not just in tables and stories.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.906
But allies,
however unlikely, should be welcomed.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.366
Especially in times of war.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.292
Sorry, but I can't let you walk out with this.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.217
It's way above the legal voltage limit.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.094
I only use it for hunting.

12:45.307 --> 12:48.014
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure
you could use it to jump-start a 747.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.769
This property belongs to me
and the charges were dropped.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.805
Although, I'm not exactly sure
who's responsible for that.

12:55.025 --> 12:58.108
I am. I'll take care of this, Parrish.

12:58.654 --> 12:59.814
Sheriff, I'm not kidding.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.986
This thing's a few watts
from being a Iightsaber.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.989
I said I'll take care of it.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.824
The specialist I saw in LA told me
the thing that every doctor says

13:10.040 --> 13:11.996
when he's trying to avoid a lawsuit.

13:12.251 --> 13:13.912
"We can't say for sure."

13:15.337 --> 13:16.702
And then I spoke with Melissa.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.548
These are brain scans.
My wife's and Stiles'.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.792
I knew they were similar.

13:24.263 --> 13:25.719
But those are the same.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.593
Exactly the same.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.349
- And I'm guessing this isn't possible?
- Not even remotely.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.681
So the trickster is still playing tricks.

13:35.399 --> 13:36.855
But why this trick?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.978
When I was in the Army,

13:39.486 --> 13:42.444
an officer told me,
"If you want to defeat your enemy,

13:43.323 --> 13:45.188
"you don't take away their courage.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.487
"You take away their hope."

13:48.161 --> 13:50.994
You don't look like
a man who gives up hope easily.

13:51.206 --> 13:52.662
But Stiles might.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.872
If this thing inside him,
if it's using his mother's disease

13:58.088 --> 14:00.374
as some sort of psychological trick,

14:01.049 --> 14:02.835
then this isn't just a fight for his body.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.007
It's also a fight for his mind. Right?

14:05.595 --> 14:08.462
You know, he's left people severely injured.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.014
And others severely dead.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.263
That's why I need the two of you.

14:16.982 --> 14:20.440
I need people
who are experienced in this kind of thing.

14:23.989 --> 14:26.321
I need you to help me stop him.

14:27.951 --> 14:31.864
And by stop him, you mean trap him.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.000
Why do I like you
when you're acting tough?

15:21.505 --> 15:23.666
Maybe because you
want me to be a fighter.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.086
No, I like my handsome medic.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.928
Don't like him too much.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.253
Your handsome medic is getting worried.

15:31.932 --> 15:35.595
I think you need to ease up on all the stuff
you're taking off the truck, Noshiko.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.433
Especially medical supplies.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.682
People are starting to notice.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.638
So what if they notice?

15:44.027 --> 15:46.359
You're quoting Japanese proverbs to me?

15:46.571 --> 15:48.653
The stake that sticks out
gets hammered down.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.234
It's a good proverb.

15:51.410 --> 15:54.527
You know they're gonna come in
and just confiscate everything, right?

15:54.788 --> 15:56.779
They'll punish everyone
and get them to turn you in.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.573
- That's how they do it in the Army.
- Okay, I get it.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.368
And if missing
a few bottles of aspirin is that bad,

16:02.587 --> 16:04.043
I'll bring them back.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.211
Let me help. I can get stuff too.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.925
I can be pretty sly myself.

16:12.264 --> 16:13.674
Oh, my God. Is that chocolate?

16:16.810 --> 16:20.018
- I thought you liked it when I'm tough.
- I like chocolate more.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.652
Okay, stop. Just stop.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.608
We don't want
to hear your "Casablanca" story.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.159
We wanna know how to save Stiles.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.660
I'm trying to tell you.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.290
You're trying to stall.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.827
When the sun goes down,

16:42.043 --> 16:43.829
the oni are gonna come after
him again, aren't they?

16:44.045 --> 16:45.296
Your friend's gone, Scott.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.378
I don't think you know that for sure.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.212
You brought the oni. Can you call them off?

16:51.470 --> 16:52.926
It's not his fault.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.136
Stiles may be your best friend.

16:55.432 --> 16:59.016
He might be like a brother to you.
But he is nogitsune now.

16:59.311 --> 17:00.346
He is void.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.143
Can you call them off?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.846
When you hear the rest of the story,
you won't want me to.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.865
This is everything non-lethal I could find.

17:19.498 --> 17:20.487
Take all of it.

17:21.666 --> 17:22.701
What's the plan here?

17:22.918 --> 17:26.001
Our best shot right now is for Derek to try
to pick up Stiles' scent at Eichen House.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.124
Especially if he went through
something stressful there.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.163
Should all four of us
be going to the same place?

17:30.509 --> 17:31.965
Where else has Stiles been showing up?

17:32.135 --> 17:34.000
School, the hospital.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.212
Okay, hold on. We did this already.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.346
He disappeared.
We started looking for him.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.758
Then walked right into
a trap at the hospital.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.478
He's getting us to repeat the same moves.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.811
So, what do we do?
Wait for him to come to us?

17:45.023 --> 17:47.514
We can't. Not if the oni find
him when the sun goes down.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.516
Scott's working on them
right now, with Kira.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.896
That's the problem.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.977
We're all trying to outfox the fox.

17:57.035 --> 17:57.990
Listen.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.827
I'll understand if anyone wants to back out.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.997
I'm not gonna be
the first wolf to run from a fox.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.836
Apparently I'm carrying a Iightsaber.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.631
Dad, you and Derek hit Eichen House.
Sheriff, it's you and me in the hospital.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.583
We all meet in the school.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.845
Making sure you have
a few lethal options just in case?

18:24.062 --> 18:25.723
I like to prepare for the worst.

18:26.398 --> 18:29.105
Rhys and I found ways to see each other.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.354
Sometimes at the barracks.

18:33.572 --> 18:36.655
Sometimes in the bunkers
where they parked military vehicles.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.700
He was being transferred
to North Africa in a few weeks.

18:41.162 --> 18:43.073
l was teaching him some French.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.122
Foudre. It's an "ah" sound.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.419
Coup de toudre.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.418
Not bad. It's an idiom.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.375
But the literal translation
is "bolt of lightning."

19:00.056 --> 19:01.045
Embrasse-moi.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.470
I don't remember teaching you that.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.219
That one's self-taught.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.187
I figured it might come in handy.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.691
So, embrasse-moi.

19:15.030 --> 19:15.985
Kiss me.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.087
We watched Merrick and Hayes
talking with the camp doctor.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.007
They were whispering, talking quickly.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.013
Noshiko.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.558
Mom, what are you doing?

20:01.034 --> 20:02.240
How did you do that?

20:03.161 --> 20:04.697
It's one of our talents.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.494
Something you'll learn, Kira.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.455
You should've noticed by now
that you never get sick.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.495
Ever.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.955
You'll never experience
something as simple as a common cold.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.335
Something as bad as the flu.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.843
Or something like...

20:22.055 --> 20:24.546
Pneumonia. Same as the others.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.972
- Rinko...
- I'm okay. It's not that bad.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.577
Everyone's coming down with pneumonia.
And we are all out of M and B.

20:52.043 --> 20:52.998
M and B?

20:53.545 --> 20:56.127
May and Baker Pharmaceuticals.
It's sulfadiazine.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.630
I saw those boxes.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.584
- What do you mean boxes? We only got one.
- There were three.

21:02.846 --> 21:06.430
I know I took a bunch of stuff off that truck,
but I didn't take any M and B.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.219
Rhys checked his log.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.552
But we already knew what was happening.

21:13.481 --> 21:16.814
Dr. Liston was using Merrick and Hayes

21:17.026 --> 21:19.608
to sell medicine on the black market.

21:23.491 --> 21:26.779
Michio? Michio? Michio!

21:46.848 --> 21:49.055
Listen. Listen!

21:49.267 --> 21:51.258
All we have to do is
go to the administration

21:51.478 --> 21:53.139
and issue a formal complaint.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.640
You want to talk to them?
Let's talk to them.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.564
Let's tell them how one of their doctors

21:58.777 --> 22:01.519
has been stealing medication
and selling it on the black market.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.021
They'll listen. They have to.

22:04.449 --> 22:05.780
I'm sure they will.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.859
They'll nod their heads
with their condescending smiles.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.943
They'll say, "A new shipment is on its way.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.029
"Any day now." While today...

22:14.209 --> 22:15.745
Today,

22:16.503 --> 22:17.913
my son is dead.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.329
I know how you feel...

22:22.550 --> 22:25.132
No, Rinko. I know how you feel.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.513
You feel sick.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.845
I'm going to bury you next to Michio.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.802
You want to know what I think?

22:32.393 --> 22:35.055
You won't even get a condescending smile.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.603
They won't listen to us.

22:38.316 --> 22:39.817
Why should they?

22:42.987 --> 22:44.397
I have a way to make them listen.

22:45.073 --> 22:49.658
I had realized the mistake I had made
by speaking too soon.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.530
I wasn't helping anyone.
I was inciting a riot.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.258
Stop! Stop! Put your guns away.

23:11.474 --> 23:13.055
Put 'em away!

23:16.187 --> 23:17.597
We want the doctor!

23:23.403 --> 23:25.314
Those people,
if they manage to drag me out

23:25.530 --> 23:27.441
of this car, do you know
what's going to happen?

23:27.615 --> 23:29.992
They are going to
put a noose around my neck!

23:30.201 --> 23:33.238
And maybe they'll be polite enough
to ask me if I have any last words.

23:33.454 --> 23:34.990
You know what those
last words are gonna be?

23:35.206 --> 23:36.286
"I had help."

23:36.499 --> 23:39.036
So maybe we throw you out there now
and provide a little distraction, huh?

23:39.294 --> 23:41.876
They've got a few pipes,
some rocks and sticks.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.203
You've got guns.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.334
Now, get out there and shoot something.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.040
Do it!

23:47.552 --> 23:49.338
I yelled for them to stop.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.049
But so many people were sick.

23:52.891 --> 23:54.427
And so many were dying.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.050
I'd never seen anger like that.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.391
It was a living, breathing thing.

24:30.345 --> 24:33.337
Get back! Back! Get back! Get back!

24:46.069 --> 24:50.312
Now I knew why
Satomi was always trying to keep quiet.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.856
Why she got migraines once a month,

24:53.076 --> 24:55.909
and why she was always at the game of Go.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.656
It kept her calm.

24:59.457 --> 25:00.663
She was bitten.

25:01.084 --> 25:02.540
Bitten werewolves

25:02.752 --> 25:04.663
have a harder time suppressing their anger.

25:04.879 --> 25:08.121
One unexpected flare-up
and they could lose all control.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.415
You know what,
I don't know how you guys do it.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.786
You're all so strong.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.330
You're fearless.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.628
Hell, you even manage
to keep your grades up.

25:53.219 --> 25:56.211
I am failing Econ.

25:57.181 --> 25:58.466
Is that Coach's class?

26:02.103 --> 26:04.014
Well, I'll have a talk with him.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.109
Hey. You okay?

26:22.749 --> 26:24.205
I'm not...

26:25.084 --> 26:26.199
Fearless.

26:27.378 --> 26:28.993
I'm terrified.

26:29.672 --> 26:32.049
I'm always terrified. I...

26:32.467 --> 26:35.049
I act like I know what I'm doing, but I don't.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.678
I don't know if Isaac is dying right now.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.844
I don't know if I made a mistake with Scott.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.395
I don't know what my dad is thinking.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.599
I don't know if we should trust Derek.
I don't know...

26:50.818 --> 26:52.228
I don't know anything.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.532
You know what's funny?

27:05.583 --> 27:07.119
You sound just like a cop.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.087
Hey.

27:23.559 --> 27:24.935
You're gonna be okay.

27:26.896 --> 27:27.976
Okay.

27:34.403 --> 27:35.654
What's that?

27:35.863 --> 27:37.819
Someone's breaking into my house.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.273
After Stiles started sleepwalking,

27:41.369 --> 27:43.451
I had some security precautions put in.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.745
Motion sensors. Cameras.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.163
Is that his room?

28:34.630 --> 28:36.541
The gunfire nearly killed me.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.669
I don't know how many bullets
made their way into my body,

28:39.886 --> 28:41.626
but I fought every one of them.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.636
It left my body so weak,

28:44.807 --> 28:47.924
my heartbeat so slow
it appeared as though I was dead.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.645
But even then

28:54.859 --> 28:56.815
I was still better off than Rhys.

28:59.530 --> 29:02.818
His screams could
be heard throughout Eichen House,

29:03.326 --> 29:06.068
echoing through every room,
every hallway.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.028
He died in agony.

29:11.083 --> 29:15.793
The doctor, it seems,
had also sold the morphine.

29:20.092 --> 29:24.381
Merrick and Hayes were given the task
of getting rid of all the bodies,

29:24.805 --> 29:27.091
both American and Japanese-American.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.677
They were transferring
Dr. Liston out as well,

29:32.897 --> 29:34.728
stationing him somewhere else.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.441
They were covering it up.

29:44.242 --> 29:47.530
The doctor, Merrick, Hayes,
and all of the others.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.694
They were gonna get away with murder.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.292
By chance, I guess,

29:58.506 --> 30:01.088
Rhys' body had been put next to mine.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.870
I wanted the soldiers
and the administration of the camp

30:41.090 --> 30:43.046
to be punished for their crime.

30:43.801 --> 30:45.507
But I knew the clock was ticking.

30:46.262 --> 30:48.503
I was going to lose my chance.

30:49.724 --> 30:52.136
They were going
to burn me with the others.

30:55.104 --> 30:58.722
I couldn't fight back
with my body weakened and still healing.

30:59.108 --> 31:00.939
I could barely move.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.146
I was going to die.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.233
With time slipping through my fingers,

31:07.533 --> 31:09.990
I knew I was making a terrible decision.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.615
But I could not die knowing
they would get away.

31:13.998 --> 31:17.582
So I called out
to our ancestors for kitsune-tsuki.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.583
Possession by a fox spirit.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.660
For a powerful nogitsune,

31:22.173 --> 31:26.041
one that feeds off chaos, strife and pain,

31:28.095 --> 31:30.711
to take control of my weakened body,

31:31.182 --> 31:35.516
imbue it with power
and use it as a weapon.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.686
But calling on a trickster spirit
is a dangerous thing.

31:40.024 --> 31:42.481
They can have a very dark sense of humor.

31:43.444 --> 31:47.028
Because while the nogitsune did
come to possess someone,

31:49.533 --> 31:50.943
it wasn't me.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.506
What the hell.

32:15.851 --> 32:18.718
- What happened?
- My body was beginning to heal.

32:19.730 --> 32:21.891
And I managed to pull myself
up from the ground.

32:22.191 --> 32:23.852
But it was too late.

32:29.073 --> 32:31.485
Rhys! Rhys, stop!

32:32.326 --> 32:33.657
Rhys!

32:39.667 --> 32:40.873
Rhys!

32:42.670 --> 32:43.876
What did it do?

32:44.088 --> 32:48.832
It brought chaos,
strife and more pain than you can imagine.

33:53.657 --> 33:56.273
I had to find him.
I had to stop him.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.163
Kira, hurry. Night is coming.

35:00.474 --> 35:02.965
Coup de toudre.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.791
The literal translation
is "a bolt of lightning."

35:30.170 --> 35:33.253
In French, it can also mean
"love at first sight."

35:36.760 --> 35:40.127
But a bolt of lightning happens to be
exactly what we need right now.

35:40.764 --> 35:41.719
For what?

35:41.932 --> 35:45.299
Excising the nogitsune
from Rhys' body shattered the katana.

35:46.729 --> 35:48.560
But you can put it back together.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.600
Why don't you just do it yourself?

35:50.816 --> 35:53.023
Because I'm not a thunder kitsune.

35:56.113 --> 35:57.398
Do you trust me?

35:57.865 --> 35:59.526
I just found out you're 900 years old.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.407
I don't think I'm ever gonna trust you again.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.868
Trust me on this.

36:39.156 --> 36:42.239
What is all this?
What are these sticky notes for?

36:42.743 --> 36:47.487
This is what Stiles used
to try and explain to me about all of you.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.868
Well, maybe it's a message from Stiles.

36:51.085 --> 36:52.165
The real Stiles.

36:55.631 --> 36:57.872
You think there's any reason
my name's on the king?

36:58.217 --> 36:59.627
Well, you're heavily guarded.

36:59.927 --> 37:02.760
Though I guess the alarming detail is that

37:03.472 --> 37:05.838
you're one move from being in checkmate.

37:10.104 --> 37:11.844
It's a threat from the nogitsune.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.770
He's at the loft.
That's what he's trying to tell us.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.597
- And he wants us to come there.
- Night's falling.

37:15.818 --> 37:18.525
- This couldn't sound any more like a trap.
- I don't think it is.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.853
I think your opinion
might be slightly biased, Sheriff.

37:21.073 --> 37:22.108
Hear me out.

37:22.324 --> 37:25.441
What we're dealing with here is
basically someone who lacks motive.

37:25.661 --> 37:27.117
No rhyme, no reason, right?

37:27.413 --> 37:29.825
- Meaning what?
- Our enemy is not a killer.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.326
It's a trickster.
The killing is just a by-product.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.872
If you're trying to say it won't kill us,
I'm not feeling too confident about that.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.999
It won't. It wants irony.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.664
It wants to play a trick. It wants a joke.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.049
All we need to do

37:43.637 --> 37:45.138
is come up with a new punch line.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.050
The sun is setting, Sheriff.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.135
What do you have in mind?

38:17.212 --> 38:18.497
Go ahead.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.499
It's yours now.

38:22.676 --> 38:24.132
What if I don't want it?

38:25.846 --> 38:27.086
You need it.

38:29.767 --> 38:32.053
You see? It gives you balance.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.259
My power is yours now, Kira.

38:34.688 --> 38:37.020
If the oni can't stop Stiles, you have to.

38:37.608 --> 38:39.018
The same as I did.

38:41.570 --> 38:44.027
And maybe seek out a wolf to help you.

38:45.032 --> 38:46.522
You didn't tell us anything.

38:46.909 --> 38:49.025
You want to save Stiles? Kill him.

38:50.621 --> 38:52.031
That's the only way.

38:53.665 --> 38:54.791
You agree with this?

38:55.083 --> 38:57.745
Sometimes, history does
repeat itself, Scott.

38:59.129 --> 39:00.665
Only if you don't learn.

39:00.881 --> 39:04.465
But sometimes even then,
fate conspires against you.

39:13.393 --> 39:15.054
There's a way to save him.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.010
There has to be.

39:21.235 --> 39:22.441
Kira.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.233
I'll take it somewhere safe.

40:08.448 --> 40:09.904
That's not what I'm worried about.

40:11.994 --> 40:15.452
History has not done well
with making children into killers.

40:17.791 --> 40:19.406
These children played their part in it

40:19.626 --> 40:21.878
long before we came back to Beacon Hills.

40:31.096 --> 40:34.213
I buried the jar
deep within the roots of the Nemeton.

40:34.975 --> 40:37.842
It was their sacrifice
that brought its power back.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.647
They let the demon out of its cage.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.209
Hi, Dad.
