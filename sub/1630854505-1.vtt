WEBVTT

00:20.098 --> 00:22.540
- So December 3rd, 1999

00:22.540 --> 00:25.510
we went home that night
and about 11:30 at night

00:25.510 --> 00:28.860
we got a call from Hal's
good friend, Jeremy

00:28.860 --> 00:32.887
and he had indicated that Hal
had been in a car accident.

00:33.869 --> 00:36.550
- So the night of Hal's accident,

00:36.550 --> 00:39.710
we were at a conference and
we were coming back from it.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.263
He gets in the car, I get in my car

00:41.263 --> 00:43.160
and we head out.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.373
He got ahead of me and
I caught a red light.

00:48.990 --> 00:51.960
- Hal was driving about 65 miles per hour.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.480
- The drunk driver was
going 80 miles an hour.

00:54.480 --> 00:58.203
- Someone crossed the
median and hit them head on.

01:00.270 --> 01:01.997
His Ford Mustang spun around

01:01.997 --> 01:04.643
and the oncoming driver T-boned him.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.310
- There was like all this debris

01:11.310 --> 01:13.023
in the middle of the freeway.

01:13.023 --> 01:15.737
- And my buddy looks
out the window and says

01:15.737 --> 01:17.470
"I think there was a Mustang
on the side of the road. "

01:17.470 --> 01:19.530
I was like, "Dude, I couldn't even tell. "

01:19.530 --> 01:20.887
And as I kind of started
driving he's like,

01:20.887 --> 01:25.760
"No man, I think that was Hal's Mustang. "

01:25.760 --> 01:27.202
- When I talked to Jeremy,

01:27.202 --> 01:30.210
I told him to tell Hal that we loved him

01:30.210 --> 01:32.680
and that he had to hang in there

01:32.680 --> 01:34.573
and that we were all coming.

01:35.450 --> 01:36.690
- The fire department when they showed up,

01:36.690 --> 01:40.593
they had to cut through the
car to have to pull him out.

01:43.202 --> 01:46.119
(machines beeping)

01:49.140 --> 01:51.790
His heart had stopped for
about six or seven minutes.

01:58.090 --> 02:01.230
- I remember walking through the door

02:01.230 --> 02:03.510
and it was like they'd
been waiting for us.

02:03.510 --> 02:05.370
There was whispers and it
was like the Elrods are here

02:05.370 --> 02:07.383
and then we were rushed into a room.

02:08.380 --> 02:11.800
- The damage that was done
to his body was horrific.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.730
I did not expect him to
live through the weekend.

02:15.730 --> 02:17.080
- He's probably not gonna be able to hear

02:17.080 --> 02:18.270
because of the damage to his ear.

02:18.270 --> 02:19.103
He might not be able to see

02:19.103 --> 02:20.630
'cause he had shattered
bones around his eye.

02:20.630 --> 02:21.790
He'll never walk again.

02:21.790 --> 02:23.840
- There was so much brain trauma

02:23.840 --> 02:26.653
and they told us that
he would be a vegetable.

02:27.790 --> 02:31.073
- I think he was in a
coma for about a week.

02:32.082 --> 02:33.860
- At first, it was like, say goodbye.

02:33.860 --> 02:34.693
Then they were like,

02:34.693 --> 02:37.260
oh, looks like he might make it sort of.

02:37.260 --> 02:39.010
- We knew he was alive inside,

02:39.010 --> 02:40.100
his brain was still working,

02:40.100 --> 02:40.960
he wasn't a vegetable.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.261
And he woke up the next day talking.

02:43.261 --> 02:44.520
- When Hal woke up

02:44.520 --> 02:46.930
his short term memory
was completely impacted.

02:46.930 --> 02:49.043
So it was like Groundhog's Day every day.

02:49.043 --> 02:52.130
I remember one time he's like,
"Did I get in a plane crash?"

02:52.130 --> 02:53.500
I think we went with
that story for the while.

02:53.500 --> 02:57.314
I was like, tomorrow, we'll
retell the real story again.

02:57.314 --> 02:58.800
He took his first step

02:58.800 --> 03:00.610
and it was another one of those things

03:00.610 --> 03:02.110
where people were just shocked

03:02.110 --> 03:04.050
at how fast he was coming back.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.573
- He just defied everything
the doctors said.

03:09.350 --> 03:11.610
We laughed through all of it which is,

03:11.610 --> 03:13.070
you always kind of found humor,

03:13.070 --> 03:15.263
and I think that helped him survive.

03:17.540 --> 03:20.263
- When Hal got out of the
hospital four months later

03:20.263 --> 03:23.607
his high school principal
called and he said,

03:23.607 --> 03:25.437
"I know this is crazy", but he goes,

03:25.437 --> 03:27.700
"do you think Hal would
speak to the student body?"

03:27.700 --> 03:32.223
And so that was the start
really of Hal's speaking career.

03:34.310 --> 03:36.040
- I just feel like Hal
had another purpose,

03:36.040 --> 03:37.240
he wasn't done yet.

03:37.240 --> 03:38.693
I still believe that now.

03:39.680 --> 03:40.603
It was a miracle.

03:53.109 --> 03:56.242
- My mom and dad were
called in by the doctors

03:56.242 --> 03:58.580
after I had been awake for a week

03:58.580 --> 04:01.030
and I had been evaluated
by all the psychologists

04:02.180 --> 04:03.807
and the doctors sat
them down and they said,

04:03.807 --> 04:05.700
"We want to give you an update on Hal. "

04:05.700 --> 04:07.042
They said,

04:07.042 --> 04:09.250
"We're concerned with Hal's
mental and emotional state.

04:09.250 --> 04:13.677
We believe that Hal is
in denial or delusional

04:13.677 --> 04:15.850
because every time we interact with him,

04:15.850 --> 04:19.138
the psychologist, his doctors,
his physical therapist,

04:19.138 --> 04:24.138
Hal's always smiling
and laughing and joking

04:24.180 --> 04:26.580
and telling us jokes, making us laugh. "

04:26.580 --> 04:28.840
And they said, "Frankly,
that's not normal. "

04:28.840 --> 04:31.370
They said, "That's not normal
for a 20 year old young man

04:31.370 --> 04:34.370
that's being told you're
never going to walk again. "

04:34.370 --> 04:37.180
I can't change that I
was in a car accident,

04:37.180 --> 04:38.410
but I can change everything else

04:38.410 --> 04:40.633
and I can damn well choose my attitude.

04:41.720 --> 04:45.160
I will be the happiest,
most grateful person

04:45.160 --> 04:48.493
that you or anyone has
ever seen in a wheelchair.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.623
Consider that.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.023
What's your wheelchair?

04:54.410 --> 04:56.160
What's a circumstance in your life

04:56.160 --> 04:56.993
that you can reference,

04:56.993 --> 04:58.960
past, present, or maybe even

04:58.960 --> 05:00.360
you're worried about for the future

05:00.360 --> 05:02.580
that's out of your control?

05:02.580 --> 05:04.240
Especially if it's in the past, right?

05:04.240 --> 05:06.540
Or if it's happening now
based on past events.

05:07.800 --> 05:08.780
But what's your wheelchair?

05:08.780 --> 05:10.970
What's that experience, that circumstance,

05:10.970 --> 05:12.621
that challenge, that adversity

05:12.621 --> 05:16.126
that has caused you emotional pain

05:16.126 --> 05:20.330
when really you need to take
a deep breath and acknowledge

05:20.330 --> 05:22.903
I can't change it, it's in the past?

05:25.940 --> 05:27.130
I might as well be the happiest,

05:27.130 --> 05:29.503
most grateful person I could ever be

05:29.503 --> 05:32.580
even though that thing happened

05:32.580 --> 05:35.840
or even though I'm going
through that thing right now.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.580
Because see the two
aren't mutually exclusive,

05:37.580 --> 05:39.320
but most of us think that they are.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.767
Most of us think that bad,
painful thing happened,

05:42.767 --> 05:45.623
happening, I feel bad.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.061
Well, the reality is

05:48.061 --> 05:49.150
you can endure

05:49.150 --> 05:51.910
the most difficult painful
circumstance in your life

05:51.910 --> 05:54.280
and choose to be the happiest

05:54.280 --> 05:56.303
and most grateful you've ever been.

05:57.661 --> 06:00.244
(gentle music)

06:01.080 --> 06:03.580
Why is it that when a baby is born,

06:03.580 --> 06:07.002
we often refer to them
as the miracle of life,

06:07.002 --> 06:10.853
but then we go on to accept
mediocrity for our own lives?

06:11.720 --> 06:12.830
Where along the way

06:12.830 --> 06:15.763
did we lose sight of the
miracle that we are living?

06:18.100 --> 06:21.290
Perhaps we became jaded by the challenges,

06:21.290 --> 06:23.543
the setbacks and the disappointments.

06:25.615 --> 06:27.260
When we were born,

06:27.260 --> 06:29.840
everyone assured us that we could do, have

06:29.840 --> 06:32.763
and be anything we wanted when we grew up.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.020
So now that you've grown up,

06:36.020 --> 06:38.640
are you doing, having and being

06:38.640 --> 06:41.363
anything and everything
you've ever wanted?

06:56.301 --> 06:58.384
(crying)

07:05.610 --> 07:07.890
I can only learn, grow

07:07.890 --> 07:10.763
and become better than
I've ever been before.

07:18.609 --> 07:20.420
I think we struggle most in life

07:20.420 --> 07:24.370
when we fail to take
responsibility for our lives.

07:24.370 --> 07:27.820
It's easy to blame other
people, outside forces,

07:27.820 --> 07:30.750
for how we feel or how
we're limited in our life.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.410
But when we allow our outer world

07:33.410 --> 07:34.910
to dictate our inner world,

07:34.910 --> 07:36.000
we give away our power,

07:36.000 --> 07:37.360
we lose control.

07:37.360 --> 07:41.700
And in doing so, we feel
stressed and we get depressed

07:41.700 --> 07:43.990
and we experience fear and anxiety

07:43.990 --> 07:46.740
and life becomes a struggle.

07:46.740 --> 07:49.170
Mentally and emotionally
more prescription medication

07:49.170 --> 07:51.470
is doled out now by doctors

07:51.470 --> 07:53.653
than has ever been recorded in history.

07:54.650 --> 07:58.239
Relationally, the divorce
rate is still over 50%.

07:58.239 --> 08:00.270
Physically, the obesity rate

08:00.270 --> 08:03.199
is higher than it's ever been before.

08:03.199 --> 08:07.520
Financially, there's more
personal debt in the United States

08:07.520 --> 08:10.130
than at any other time in our history.

08:10.130 --> 08:12.220
People are settling for
less than they're capable of

08:12.220 --> 08:15.393
and as a result of settling,
life becomes a struggle.

08:16.450 --> 08:18.940
According to the social
security administration,

08:18.940 --> 08:20.350
if you take any 100 people

08:20.350 --> 08:22.150
at the start of their working careers

08:22.150 --> 08:24.260
and follow them for the next 40 years

08:24.260 --> 08:27.490
until they reach retirement
age, here's what you'll find.

08:27.490 --> 08:29.210
Only one will be wealthy.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.620
Four will be financially secure.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.400
Five will continue working,

08:33.400 --> 08:36.520
not because they want to,
but because they have to.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.120
36 will be dead.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.740
And 54 will be broke and dependent

08:40.740 --> 08:43.530
on friends family, relatives,

08:43.530 --> 08:45.920
and the government to take care of them.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.400
Monetarily speaking,

08:47.400 --> 08:49.800
that's only 5% of us who will succeed

08:49.800 --> 08:51.970
in creating a life of freedom

08:51.970 --> 08:56.170
and 95% who will continue to
struggle their entire lives.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.950
It's no wonder that
nationwide polls have shown

08:58.950 --> 09:02.433
that only one in three
Americans are actually happy.

09:07.830 --> 09:09.310
- Let's talk more about
what's going on here

09:09.310 --> 09:11.420
in this trading session so far today

09:11.420 --> 09:12.610
after this big plunge.

09:12.610 --> 09:15.410
- I've had in my life, what I
would call two rock bottoms.

09:15.410 --> 09:17.640
In 2008, the US economy crashed

09:17.640 --> 09:19.597
and like so many other
people in the world,

09:19.597 --> 09:22.351
I suffered the financial consequences.

09:22.351 --> 09:25.950
Overnight, I lost over half my income,

09:25.950 --> 09:27.570
I couldn't pay my mortgage,

09:27.570 --> 09:29.300
I lost my house,

09:29.300 --> 09:31.170
I was deep in debt,

09:31.170 --> 09:32.810
I got in the worst shape physically,

09:32.810 --> 09:36.159
and for the first time in my
life, I got deeply depressed.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.400
I was a motivational speaker.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.370
To tell everyone that
I was failing miserably

09:40.370 --> 09:42.350
was a real identity crisis for me.

09:42.350 --> 09:43.580
- I was never worried

09:43.580 --> 09:46.540
that Hal was gonna fall into depression

09:46.540 --> 09:48.440
but then he started to,

09:48.440 --> 09:50.320
and I couldn't shake him out of it.

09:50.320 --> 09:54.560
I finally realized that there's
nothing I can do or say.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.060
It needs to be somebody else,

09:56.060 --> 09:58.180
maybe somebody else's
perspective, a third party.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.360
So I recommended that he go

09:59.360 --> 10:01.210
and talk to his friend, Jon Berghoff.

10:03.679 --> 10:04.512
- Hal called me and said,

10:04.512 --> 10:06.320
"JB, I'm really struggling in my life. "

10:06.320 --> 10:08.267
And I just said to him, I said,

10:08.267 --> 10:10.750
"Hey buddy, I don't have all the answers

10:10.750 --> 10:13.070
but I feel like you really need

10:13.070 --> 10:15.017
to become the type of person

10:15.017 --> 10:19.490
that deserves to attract that success. "

10:19.490 --> 10:21.390
And he really took that to heart.

10:21.390 --> 10:23.110
- And I was expecting business advice

10:23.110 --> 10:24.590
you know, step one, step two, step three,

10:24.590 --> 10:26.090
and he said, "Hal, two things,

10:26.090 --> 10:27.400
you need to exercise every morning,

10:27.400 --> 10:29.450
go for a run every morning.

10:29.450 --> 10:30.500
And while you're on that run,

10:30.500 --> 10:32.350
listen to some self-help,

10:32.350 --> 10:34.036
listen to a business audio book. "

10:34.036 --> 10:35.160
And he said, "Put yourself

10:35.160 --> 10:36.980
in a peak, physical,
mental, and emotional state

10:36.980 --> 10:39.310
every morning to start your day

10:39.310 --> 10:41.570
and then learn something
you can apply to your life,

10:41.570 --> 10:43.270
to your business, to your goals

10:43.270 --> 10:44.730
while you're in that peak state. "

10:44.730 --> 10:48.470
And my response was,
"John, I hate running.

10:48.470 --> 10:49.970
What else could I do?"

10:49.970 --> 10:51.207
And without hesitation he said,

10:51.207 --> 10:52.840
"What do you hate worse, running

10:52.840 --> 10:55.830
or your circumstance that
you just described to me?"

10:55.830 --> 10:58.407
I said, "Okay, touche
buddy, I'll go for a run. "

10:59.980 --> 11:01.130
I grabbed my iPod,

11:01.130 --> 11:03.583
which I was this close
to selling for food,

11:03.583 --> 11:07.360
and on that run I heard
a quote from Jim Rohn

11:07.360 --> 11:09.370
that changed my entire life.

11:09.370 --> 11:10.397
Jim Rohn said,

11:10.397 --> 11:11.590
"Your level of success

11:11.590 --> 11:14.320
will seldom exceed your
level of personal development

11:14.320 --> 11:16.356
because success is something you attract

11:16.356 --> 11:17.957
by the person you become. "

11:21.685 --> 11:24.500
I realized I'm not
dedicating time everyday

11:24.500 --> 11:26.030
to my personal development,

11:26.030 --> 11:28.860
therefore I'm not becoming
the person that I need to be

11:28.860 --> 11:31.620
that can attract or create or sustain

11:31.620 --> 11:33.673
the success that I want in my life.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.290
And I had an epiphany.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.790
I thought I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna go online

11:40.790 --> 11:42.010
and I'm gonna Google,

11:42.010 --> 11:45.230
What are the world's most
successful people do every day

11:45.230 --> 11:46.630
for their personal development?

11:46.630 --> 11:47.961
I'm gonna figure out

11:47.961 --> 11:50.180
what the best personal
development practice is

11:50.180 --> 11:52.950
known to man and I'm gonna do that.

11:52.950 --> 11:54.164
And after an hour of research,

11:54.164 --> 11:55.890
I couldn't narrow it down to one,

11:55.890 --> 11:57.540
I had a list of six.

11:57.540 --> 11:58.622
And those six practices

11:58.622 --> 12:01.720
when I tried to figure out
which was the best of the six,

12:01.720 --> 12:02.810
there was no clear answer,

12:02.810 --> 12:05.640
it depended on which successful
person that you asked.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.740
So I had an epiphany.

12:07.740 --> 12:10.160
I thought, what if I did all six of them?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.420
What if I woke up tomorrow

12:11.420 --> 12:16.000
and I did all six practices
in one hour, one ritual?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.860
My research had shown no one does all six,

12:18.860 --> 12:21.330
maybe one or two, three at the most.

12:21.330 --> 12:22.190
And I thought this would be

12:22.190 --> 12:24.253
the ultimate personal development ritual.

12:29.611 --> 12:31.100
I woke up the next morning,

12:31.100 --> 12:32.302
even though I wasn't a morning person,

12:32.302 --> 12:33.610
I jumped out of bed,

12:33.610 --> 12:34.670
I went into the living room

12:34.670 --> 12:37.998
and I went through all six
practices for 10 minutes each.

12:37.998 --> 12:41.165
(inspirational music)

12:56.190 --> 12:57.510
And at the end of that hour,

12:57.510 --> 13:00.800
by 6:00 a. m. , my entire life changed

13:00.800 --> 13:03.280
because even though my outer
world was still a mess,

13:03.280 --> 13:04.490
even though my finances,

13:04.490 --> 13:06.810
and my physical health my fitness,

13:06.810 --> 13:08.656
everything was a mess on the outside,

13:08.656 --> 13:11.860
internally, I felt like I could overcome

13:11.860 --> 13:13.230
and accomplish anything.

13:13.230 --> 13:14.650
And in that moment I realized

13:14.650 --> 13:17.110
if I start every day like this

13:17.110 --> 13:20.270
with this much clarity
and motivation and energy,

13:20.270 --> 13:21.738
it's only a matter of time

13:21.738 --> 13:24.430
before I become the
person that I need to be,

13:24.430 --> 13:27.943
that can create anything
that I want for my life.

13:33.470 --> 13:35.610
- I remember first hearing
about the Miracle Morning

13:35.610 --> 13:37.760
'cause Hal was doing it

13:37.760 --> 13:41.006
and this was just in casual conversation,

13:41.006 --> 13:43.124
Hal sharing with me

13:43.124 --> 13:46.330
another routine, another
idea, another strategy

13:46.330 --> 13:50.470
that he was using to amplify his life.

13:50.470 --> 13:52.300
When I knew this was something special

13:52.300 --> 13:54.286
is when Hal called me

13:54.286 --> 13:56.910
when I think his name was Joe,

13:56.910 --> 13:59.500
somebody had posted that they
were doing the Miracle Morning

13:59.500 --> 14:01.450
and they had posted a
picture of their alarm clock

14:01.450 --> 14:06.050
and I remember the first
time that he saw the impact

14:06.050 --> 14:11.050
and the feeling that I
remember is the joy of Hal

14:12.440 --> 14:14.893
knowing that he was
helping another person.

14:16.062 --> 14:17.065
- Good morning.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.180
This is your friend, Joe, Joe De Sena,

14:19.180 --> 14:20.870
hope you're doing well.

14:20.870 --> 14:21.760
Guess what?

14:21.760 --> 14:22.910
Let's look at the time.

14:24.160 --> 14:29.097
It is 5:41 in the morning on Sunday.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.810
You must be wondering
what in the world dude

14:33.810 --> 14:35.801
are you doing this early in the morning?

14:35.801 --> 14:39.750
Well, check out Miracle Morning.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.580
It feels like Christmas to me, honestly

14:41.580 --> 14:42.937
and I've got a lot of energy.

14:42.937 --> 14:44.330
It's like Christmas every day.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.500
So anyways, check it out

14:46.500 --> 14:48.150
and hope your life will be blessed,

14:48.150 --> 14:49.273
I'll talk to you soon.

14:51.070 --> 14:53.650
- I didn't see how viral it would become

14:53.650 --> 14:55.860
where when somebody would
implement this into their life

14:55.860 --> 14:58.790
that they would then tell
other people as well.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.998
- So I actually got up at 5:00 a. m..

15:00.998 --> 15:02.360
- Good morning.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.360
It's just after six o'clock.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.220
- How to have a Miracle Morning

15:06.220 --> 15:08.300
coming to you from Jaco, Costa Rica.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.750
- I came out to work
out only in the morning,

15:10.750 --> 15:12.558
little bit earlier than my usual time.

15:12.558 --> 15:16.958
- (speaking in foreign
language) Miracle Morning.

15:16.958 --> 15:17.840
- I am not a morning person

15:17.840 --> 15:19.570
but anyone can do the Miracle Morning

15:19.570 --> 15:21.413
because it's customized to you.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.441
- You getting your Miracle Morning on?

15:24.441 --> 15:26.350
(baby cooing)

15:26.350 --> 15:28.010
- Yeah?

15:28.010 --> 15:30.303
Do you know what silence is?

15:31.635 --> 15:32.468
(baby cooing)

15:32.468 --> 15:34.090
I don't think you do.

15:34.090 --> 15:35.700
- I think there's a number of reasons

15:35.700 --> 15:37.616
why the Miracle Morning caught on.

15:37.616 --> 15:39.300
Hal packaged it in a way

15:39.300 --> 15:42.130
where there's these very clear
steps that people can take.

15:42.130 --> 15:44.510
- They need a set of instructions.

15:44.510 --> 15:45.936
They need guidelines.

15:45.936 --> 15:47.550
And I, in the beginning,

15:47.550 --> 15:51.390
underestimated the power of
giving somebody the path.

15:51.390 --> 15:55.180
- Hal's taking something fairly
complex and made it simple.

15:55.180 --> 15:56.220
Even if you're laying in bed,

15:56.220 --> 15:57.530
you can do half of them in bed.

15:57.530 --> 15:58.640
You can do your silence

15:58.640 --> 16:01.572
and your affirmations
and your visualizations

16:01.572 --> 16:03.460
before you even get out of bed.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.190
It's like a miracle pill, if you will,

16:05.190 --> 16:06.710
for starting your day right.

16:06.710 --> 16:08.795
- When I was first introduced
to the Miracle Morning

16:08.795 --> 16:11.490
I thought it was the most
ridiculous thing in the world.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.040
I was like, nope, not for me.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.460
I know people who do
things in the morning,

16:14.460 --> 16:15.620
but I'm a night person,

16:15.620 --> 16:17.140
like I'm always gonna be a night person.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.730
Course, it was very difficult at first

16:18.730 --> 16:20.831
to just wake up even an
hour earlier than normal.

16:20.831 --> 16:24.740
Before I would often wake up
at between seven and eight

16:24.740 --> 16:27.010
because it was time to get the kids ready.

16:27.010 --> 16:29.180
But you can wake up for yourself first

16:29.180 --> 16:31.690
and dedicate that energy
to personal development

16:31.690 --> 16:33.690
to improving yourself and your life

16:33.690 --> 16:36.360
so that you can better serve
other people during the day.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.900
- My morning routine is everything.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.440
It's 4:30 in the afternoon right now

16:40.440 --> 16:43.872
and I still feel annoyingly good.

16:43.872 --> 16:46.570
It's like I have this pure and this clean

16:46.570 --> 16:50.040
and this positive framed
mind and energy right now

16:50.040 --> 16:53.850
because I'm so crazy diligent
about the morning routine.

16:53.850 --> 16:57.317
- When you get intentional
about how you start your day

16:57.317 --> 16:58.875
you create a routine

16:58.875 --> 17:01.720
that sets you up for
extraordinary success,

17:01.720 --> 17:04.960
that puts you in control of
what you're thinking about,

17:04.960 --> 17:06.300
of what your priorities are,

17:06.300 --> 17:07.940
that aligns you with your values,

17:07.940 --> 17:10.320
that primes your mind to work for you

17:10.320 --> 17:12.330
instead of working against you.

17:12.330 --> 17:15.790
- For me, the most important
reason for my morning routine

17:15.790 --> 17:19.435
is to help me serve my purpose

17:19.435 --> 17:21.850
the best I possibly can.

17:21.850 --> 17:25.000
So my purpose of helping the world

17:25.000 --> 17:27.300
awaken through conscious comedy

17:27.300 --> 17:31.400
and my purpose of being the
absolute best husband to Amber

17:31.400 --> 17:32.233
that I can be

17:32.233 --> 17:34.503
and the best father to my future child

17:34.503 --> 17:36.390
that I can possibly be.

17:36.390 --> 17:39.800
I JP, see, hear, feel and
know the purpose of my life

17:39.800 --> 17:41.270
to be outrageously thankful

17:41.270 --> 17:44.466
to touch and inspire the world around me.

17:44.466 --> 17:48.500
When we have a solid morning
routine that works for us,

17:48.500 --> 17:51.350
we start the day on our terms.

17:51.350 --> 17:54.970
We're in a very proactive
posture with life

17:54.970 --> 17:56.650
with more access to the miracle

17:56.650 --> 18:00.240
of our own mind body connection.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.233
And I think that's a good thing.

18:04.220 --> 18:07.880
- My morning routine is
crucial to my personality

18:07.880 --> 18:12.130
and my career and my
spiritual and emotional life

18:12.130 --> 18:16.140
because there's something
so crisp and clear

18:16.140 --> 18:20.703
and regenerative about
the early morning hours.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.205
Me placing my routine into that

18:26.205 --> 18:29.470
is a way that helps me prime

18:29.470 --> 18:31.470
and get myself in a certain state.

18:31.470 --> 18:36.470
It is a reminder of my own divinity.

18:36.470 --> 18:40.350
I use my morning routine to remind me

18:40.350 --> 18:42.360
of who and what I really am

18:42.360 --> 18:44.580
and get myself into a particular state,

18:44.580 --> 18:47.200
a particular feeling tone,

18:47.200 --> 18:48.925
which for me is declaring

18:48.925 --> 18:51.673
what the day is gonna be about.

19:04.271 --> 19:05.820
- Next up, step ups.

19:05.820 --> 19:07.450
- Oh, step ups.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.403
This is not easy.

19:14.064 --> 19:17.303
- Three, two, one.

19:18.177 --> 19:20.383
Next up, triceps dips.

19:21.770 --> 19:23.003
10 seconds to go.

19:23.980 --> 19:24.930
- Workout complete.

19:25.890 --> 19:26.910
I don't care what my wife says

19:26.910 --> 19:28.000
about the seven minute workout

19:28.000 --> 19:30.126
and that being her
warmup and she teases me,

19:30.126 --> 19:32.420
it's a real workout folks.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.892
Probably not footage for the film.

19:34.892 --> 19:39.892
You never know.

19:40.897 --> 19:43.488
Alright, we got
everything, we ready to go?

19:43.488 --> 19:45.220
Let's go, woo!

19:45.220 --> 19:47.120
We're ready, dude, we've got our bags.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.020
We're ready to go.

19:50.892 --> 19:53.127
Going to Toronto to speak at Socialite.

19:58.012 --> 20:01.830
♪ Fly away with me ♪

20:01.830 --> 20:06.830

20:19.688 --> 20:20.845
- He's the keynote speaker.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.187
He's been in the hall of
fame business achiever.

20:23.187 --> 20:26.357
He's known as yo pal Hal.

20:26.357 --> 20:28.040
And are you guys excited?

20:28.040 --> 20:32.030
Are we gonna give Hal Elrod
a warm Toronto welcome?

20:32.030 --> 20:34.045
Everybody bring it up for Hal.

20:34.045 --> 20:37.128
(audience applause)

20:37.988 --> 20:40.024
- I want to hug you,

20:40.024 --> 20:42.232
I just want to hug you.

20:42.232 --> 20:43.357
- Thank you for coming.

20:43.357 --> 20:45.302
- How 'bout Teresa?

20:45.302 --> 20:48.603
(audience applause)

20:48.603 --> 20:49.920
- You guys want to have some fun?

20:49.920 --> 20:50.923
- Yeah.

20:50.923 --> 20:52.010
- All right, I have nothing fun planned.

20:52.010 --> 20:54.860
I apologize on that front.

20:54.860 --> 20:56.320
You're waking up 'cause you what?

20:56.320 --> 20:57.153
- Want to.

20:57.153 --> 20:58.581
- 'Cause you want to become the person

20:58.581 --> 21:00.890
that you create everything
you want for your life.

21:00.890 --> 21:05.890
Now matters more than any
other time in your life, right?

21:06.200 --> 21:07.550
You can't wait for some day.

21:07.550 --> 21:08.822
You can't wait to wake up one day

21:08.822 --> 21:12.189
and realize you could have
been, done and had so much more.

21:12.189 --> 21:15.360
Tonight, set your alarm
clock back 30 minutes,

21:15.360 --> 21:17.150
even do it right now.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.650
I will give you one bonus tip,

21:18.650 --> 21:22.043
move your alarm clock as far
across the room as possible

21:22.043 --> 21:24.960
'cause I don't care who
you are, myself included,

21:24.960 --> 21:26.803
if I can reach the alarm,

21:31.337 --> 21:34.000
if I can reach the alarm, right,

21:34.000 --> 21:37.460
if I can reach the alarm
while I'm still 90% asleep,

21:37.460 --> 21:39.440
what do you do most of the time?

21:39.440 --> 21:41.460
You snooze, right, fall back asleep?

21:41.460 --> 21:43.730
Most people for their
first 30 day challenge,

21:43.730 --> 21:45.050
they just read the "Miracle Morning"

21:45.050 --> 21:46.970
during their 30 minutes, right?

21:46.970 --> 21:48.761
Until they get to the (mumbles)

21:48.761 --> 21:50.740
and they go, oh I can
implement silence into this,

21:50.740 --> 21:52.676
then I can add affirmations, right,

21:52.676 --> 21:53.610
and go through all the practices.

21:53.610 --> 21:55.590
Who's ready to start Miracle
Morning challenge tomorrow?

21:55.590 --> 21:56.940
Raise your hand and say ay.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.970
I just want to close by saying

22:00.970 --> 22:02.150
thank you for being in this event,

22:02.150 --> 22:05.560
thank you for allowing me to
share my message with you.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.060
I hope it's inspired you,

22:07.060 --> 22:08.050
it's empowered you.

22:08.050 --> 22:09.830
I hope to see you in the
Miracle Morning community.

22:09.830 --> 22:10.663
I love you guys.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.260
Thank you so much.

22:12.260 --> 22:15.260
(audience applause)

22:20.740 --> 22:22.369
Catherine with a C, right?

22:22.369 --> 22:25.200
- Yeah, it's Catherine with a C.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.284
I've only read the first chapter

22:27.284 --> 22:30.340
and you've already conquered my fears.

22:30.340 --> 22:33.380
I know, I really respect that about you.

22:33.380 --> 22:35.650
- It was really after the book published

22:35.650 --> 22:36.623
and we started seeing,

22:36.623 --> 22:41.330
you know, dozens and then
hundreds, and then thousands

22:41.330 --> 22:43.520
of people sharing, emailing me,

22:43.520 --> 22:46.049
posting on Facebook, putting on Amazon

22:46.049 --> 22:47.990
in the form of a book review

22:47.990 --> 22:48.823
that the Miracle Morning

22:48.823 --> 22:51.694
had radically transformed their life.

22:51.694 --> 22:54.646
And we saw things like
it saved my marriage,

22:54.646 --> 22:57.710
it got me off my depression medication.

22:57.710 --> 23:02.640
- The Miracle Morning helped
me gain confidence and clarity.

23:02.640 --> 23:06.098
- The Miracle Morning
helping me in so many ways.

23:06.098 --> 23:09.898
(speaking in foreign language)

23:09.898 --> 23:10.731
- This life changing book

23:10.731 --> 23:12.347
called "The Miracle Morning" by Hal Elrod.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.830
- "Miracle Morning" by Hal Elrod.

23:14.830 --> 23:16.420
- Before eight o'clock in the morning,

23:16.420 --> 23:19.930
I am so energized that
yeah, I've done so much,

23:19.930 --> 23:21.100
I've accomplished so much.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.897
- I have the ability and the power

23:22.897 --> 23:24.820
and the control over my life

23:24.820 --> 23:26.620
to take it in the direction that I want.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.324
- I was like, I gotta do this.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.810
- This is a way out for me.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.810
- I'm happier, I'm smiling
more, it's working.

23:33.810 --> 23:36.000
- That date that I started
the Miracle Morning,

23:36.000 --> 23:37.830
that was the date that changed everything.

23:37.830 --> 23:39.820
- I saw these amazing results.

23:39.820 --> 23:41.220
And that's when I started to think bigger

23:41.220 --> 23:45.260
that wow, this is actually
changing a lot of lives.

23:45.260 --> 23:46.884
And we came up with this mission,

23:46.884 --> 23:48.910
the Miracle Morning Mission,

23:48.910 --> 23:53.070
change millions of lives
one morning at a time.

23:53.070 --> 23:54.730
- The Miracle Morning has helped me

23:54.730 --> 23:57.161
recover from a deep
depression and anxiety.

23:57.161 --> 24:01.650
(speaking in foreign language)

24:01.650 --> 24:02.804
- The Miracle Morning.

24:02.804 --> 24:05.504
- The Miracle Morning make
me feel better with myself.

24:10.402 --> 24:13.400
- When I made the decision to
write "The Miracle Morning",

24:13.400 --> 24:15.343
I thought who who's gonna read this?

24:15.343 --> 24:19.380
People have such a deeply ingrained belief

24:19.380 --> 24:21.170
of not being a morning person

24:21.170 --> 24:23.840
that is created, I
believe, when we're kids

24:23.840 --> 24:26.180
because we want to sleep in as kids

24:26.180 --> 24:28.520
and we only get out of bed
because our parents make us.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.880
So we develop this resistance
to waking up early.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.020
It's like, no, no, no,

24:32.020 --> 24:33.520
if I don't have to get out of bed,

24:33.520 --> 24:34.353
I'm not getting out of bed.

24:34.353 --> 24:36.800
I'm gonna sleep as long as
mom and dad will let me.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.950
- A lot of people say to me,

24:38.950 --> 24:41.210
well, Brendon, I'm just
not a morning person,

24:41.210 --> 24:43.060
so I don't have a morning routine.

24:43.060 --> 24:44.790
It's not that you're not a morning person,

24:44.790 --> 24:46.600
you're not a prepared person.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.280
And there's two different ways, right?

24:48.280 --> 24:50.300
'Cause those who say, well
I'm not a morning person,

24:50.300 --> 24:51.660
or I don't have a morning routine,

24:51.660 --> 24:52.660
'cause it's too much discipline,

24:52.660 --> 24:54.140
I'm just like listen,

24:54.140 --> 24:56.713
your next level of success
in life is preparation.

25:07.155 --> 25:09.230
- You don't think that it's a routine,

25:09.230 --> 25:11.690
but hitting the snooze alarm
four or five times a morning

25:11.690 --> 25:12.523
is a routine,

25:12.523 --> 25:15.700
lying in bed and allowing
anxiety to take over,

25:15.700 --> 25:17.200
that is a routine.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.090
Being late every day, that's a routine.

25:20.090 --> 25:23.920
Getting your kids to school
late, that becomes a routine.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.430
You don't think about a
routine in the negative,

25:26.430 --> 25:29.000
but most of us when we're stuck,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.190
when our lives aren't working,

25:30.190 --> 25:31.440
when we're not happy,

25:31.440 --> 25:33.007
if you were to take a look at

25:33.007 --> 25:35.534
"the routine" that you're actually in,

25:35.534 --> 25:38.030
those small five second choices

25:38.030 --> 25:40.500
create a routine of negativity

25:40.500 --> 25:42.960
that (bleep) your entire day.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.100
- Most people really do wake up

25:45.100 --> 25:46.580
and they feel exhausted

25:46.580 --> 25:47.900
and then they turn on the news.

25:47.900 --> 25:48.733
What does the news do?

25:48.733 --> 25:50.180
It actually pours cortisol,

25:50.180 --> 25:52.070
the fear chemical, through your brain.

25:52.070 --> 25:53.090
They lose their energy,

25:53.090 --> 25:54.630
they lose their creativity,

25:54.630 --> 25:57.650
they start to perceive
reality as a dangerous place

25:57.650 --> 26:00.000
versus a generous, optimistic place to be.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.180
And just because of the way
they front end load their day,

26:03.180 --> 26:05.750
they set themselves up
for a day of average.

26:05.750 --> 26:06.583
If you look at many

26:06.583 --> 26:07.880
of the most productive
people in the world,

26:07.880 --> 26:09.700
they'll have one thing in common.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.200
They were early risers.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.755
And so when I started
wiring this morning ritual,

26:13.755 --> 26:16.150
everything started to change

26:16.150 --> 26:19.320
By six o'clock, I felt
fundamentally different,

26:19.320 --> 26:20.530
I felt more confident,

26:20.530 --> 26:22.170
I felt more energy,

26:22.170 --> 26:25.470
and I believe your days
are your life in miniature.

26:25.470 --> 26:26.830
And if you start your day well,

26:26.830 --> 26:28.900
and you take care of the day that follows,

26:28.900 --> 26:29.880
the days slip into weeks,

26:29.880 --> 26:30.820
the weeks slip into months,

26:30.820 --> 26:31.680
the months slip into years.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.900
You're pretty much
guaranteed a world class life

26:33.900 --> 26:35.250
if you get your days right.

26:41.570 --> 26:44.190
- The biggest impact that
morning routines had on my life

26:44.190 --> 26:46.530
is probably a sleep regulation.

26:46.530 --> 26:47.940
Getting much more regular sleep

26:47.940 --> 26:51.520
is really one of the effects
of having a morning routine.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.670
And as a neuroscientist,

26:52.670 --> 26:55.840
regular sleep is critical
for brain health.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.700
Sleep is not just a rest mode

26:57.700 --> 26:59.440
and repair and recovery mode.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.637
Sleep is also used for learning

27:01.637 --> 27:03.713
and consolidation of memories.

27:04.810 --> 27:06.210
- Everything you do,

27:06.210 --> 27:08.670
you do better with a
good night's sleep, okay?

27:08.670 --> 27:11.780
Sleep affects every organ
system and every disease state.

27:11.780 --> 27:13.940
There is no single human function

27:13.940 --> 27:16.340
that isn't affected by the way you sleep,

27:16.340 --> 27:18.490
in amount or in quality.

27:18.490 --> 27:19.610
So let me give you an example.

27:19.610 --> 27:21.550
We now know that the more
sleep deprived you are,

27:21.550 --> 27:24.100
the faster cancer cells multiply.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.150
We know that your reaction time

27:26.150 --> 27:28.480
when you have been up
for more than 36 hours

27:28.480 --> 27:31.290
slows to the point of being a drunk driver

27:31.290 --> 27:33.280
when we put you in a driving simulator.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.730
So a lot of people ask me questions

27:34.730 --> 27:36.830
about what is optimal sleep,

27:36.830 --> 27:38.400
how can I get optimal sleep?

27:38.400 --> 27:40.570
And we have to think about
it in two different ways.

27:40.570 --> 27:42.760
Are we talking about the quantity of sleep

27:42.760 --> 27:45.060
or are we talking about
the quality of your sleep?

27:45.060 --> 27:47.520
'Cause those can actually be
two very different things.

27:47.520 --> 27:51.520
So from a quantity perspective,
eight hours is a myth.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.870
The national recommendation

27:52.870 --> 27:54.890
is somewhere between seven and nine hours.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.440
I've been a six and a half hour sleeper

27:56.440 --> 27:58.010
almost my entire life.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.840
My wife needs eight and a half or nine.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.580
So everybody's sleep need is different

28:02.580 --> 28:05.190
and that need can change over
the course of your lifetime.

28:05.190 --> 28:08.260
Consistency is going to
give you the best sleep.

28:08.260 --> 28:09.660
It's going to bed at the same time,

28:09.660 --> 28:12.500
but more importantly,
waking up at the same time

28:12.500 --> 28:14.270
every single day.

28:14.270 --> 28:16.173
So the vast majority of sleep regulation

28:16.173 --> 28:18.930
is driven by not when you go to bed,

28:18.930 --> 28:20.032
but when you wake up.

28:20.032 --> 28:23.115
There's a certain frequency,
if you will, bandwidth of light

28:23.115 --> 28:25.770
that is prevalent in the air

28:25.770 --> 28:28.640
in the first hour or so
after the sun comes up.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.900
You have about 30,000 cells in your eye

28:30.900 --> 28:32.610
called melanopsin cells.

28:32.610 --> 28:34.310
These are very sensitive

28:34.310 --> 28:36.950
to a particular level of
light called blue light,

28:36.950 --> 28:39.450
which is approximately 460 nanometers.

28:39.450 --> 28:40.420
Why is that important?

28:40.420 --> 28:42.320
Because when the blue light hits the eye,

28:42.320 --> 28:44.690
it triggers a reaction
in the melanopsin cells,

28:44.690 --> 28:46.010
which sends a signal to the brain

28:46.010 --> 28:48.130
to stop producing melatonin.

28:48.130 --> 28:49.230
Melatonin, if you remember,

28:49.230 --> 28:51.360
is the key that starts
the engine for sleep.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.730
It's what gives you
that morning fogginess.

28:53.730 --> 28:55.680
They've got this fuzzy head.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.050
They can't get it going.

28:57.050 --> 28:58.770
They're like, oh my God,
I got to drink the water,

28:58.770 --> 28:59.603
I got to do this,

28:59.603 --> 29:00.436
I got to do that.

29:00.436 --> 29:02.130
Just stand in front of a window

29:02.130 --> 29:04.440
to allow yourself to get
a little bit of sunlight

29:04.440 --> 29:07.970
because that stops that
melatonin almost immediately.

29:07.970 --> 29:10.570
And so if you get
sunlight in the first hour

29:10.570 --> 29:13.270
in your face, even a few minutes,

29:13.270 --> 29:16.630
it will strongly reset
your own circadian rhythm

29:16.630 --> 29:18.570
and sort of line it up on
the Earth's photoperiod,

29:18.570 --> 29:21.070
so you're in sync with the
Earth's daylight cycle.

29:37.971 --> 29:41.270
- I wake up in alignment
with my circadian biology.

29:41.270 --> 29:43.960
I know the time that I
perform best when I wake up

29:43.960 --> 29:46.140
and it varies from person to person.

29:46.140 --> 29:47.130
You can shift it a little bit

29:47.130 --> 29:48.410
but it's kind of wired in.

29:48.410 --> 29:50.970
When you wake up, have a glass of water.

29:50.970 --> 29:52.260
Bonus points if you put

29:52.260 --> 29:55.013
about a half a teaspoon of
Himalayan salt in the water

29:55.013 --> 29:57.800
and possibly lemon or lime juice.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.330
If you do that first thing

29:59.330 --> 30:01.340
that actually supports your adrenal glands

30:01.340 --> 30:03.811
and you can have your coffee.

30:03.811 --> 30:06.230
There are a couple of
things that you could eat

30:06.230 --> 30:07.770
in your morning routine.

30:07.770 --> 30:09.830
One practice that I really appreciate

30:09.830 --> 30:11.710
is called intermittent fasting,

30:11.710 --> 30:13.760
which means you don't eat
anything for breakfast

30:13.760 --> 30:14.730
and you have a late lunch,

30:14.730 --> 30:16.270
which gives you an 18 hour window

30:16.270 --> 30:18.530
where your body has nothing going on.

30:18.530 --> 30:19.590
So all of the enzymes

30:19.590 --> 30:20.850
that would have been used for food

30:20.850 --> 30:23.490
can be used for healing
and repair and recovery.

30:23.490 --> 30:25.020
But this is a stressor on the system.

30:25.020 --> 30:27.150
So if you're tired or
you've had a heavy workout,

30:27.150 --> 30:29.165
it's probably not the
right day to do that.

30:29.165 --> 30:32.820
The two things that matter
most in the morning are fat,

30:32.820 --> 30:35.190
the right kinds of fat and protein.

30:35.190 --> 30:36.520
Having a morning protein shake

30:36.520 --> 30:38.184
can be really beneficial for you.

30:38.184 --> 30:40.330
And when you're doing your
morning protein shake,

30:40.330 --> 30:42.210
you want to minimize the number

30:42.210 --> 30:43.410
of carbohydrates that are in it

30:43.410 --> 30:44.540
and you want to maximize

30:44.540 --> 30:46.310
the number of nutrients that are in there.

30:46.310 --> 30:49.210
So when you add things
like leafy greens to it,

30:49.210 --> 30:50.980
you're giving yourself
some extra nutrients,

30:50.980 --> 30:51.813
which are really good.

30:51.813 --> 30:54.480
And the important thing is
to make sure you get enough

30:54.480 --> 30:57.350
of the right kinds of fat
in your morning shakes.

30:57.350 --> 30:59.710
It could even be like a
little bit of almond butter.

30:59.710 --> 31:01.570
You can add real butter if you want to.

31:01.570 --> 31:03.420
Surprisingly, that's good in a shake.

31:04.343 --> 31:05.640
What you want to do

31:05.640 --> 31:09.638
is you want to eat for energy
first and taste second.

31:09.638 --> 31:13.330
When you get food that's higher
quality, you feel better.

31:13.330 --> 31:16.087
And when you feel better,
you like your life

31:16.087 --> 31:18.437
and you also spend less
at the doctor's office.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.360
- I think we all suffer

31:24.360 --> 31:26.370
from what I call rear view mirror syndrome

31:26.370 --> 31:28.430
where we constantly check
the rear view mirror

31:28.430 --> 31:29.870
to see who we've been in the past

31:29.870 --> 31:30.703
and we think that that,

31:30.703 --> 31:32.562
that that becomes our
identity of who we are.

31:32.562 --> 31:34.690
But the reality is that's who we were

31:34.690 --> 31:35.997
and who we are is who we choose to be

31:35.997 --> 31:37.490
and it really is limitless.

31:37.490 --> 31:41.067
- So Hal, how do we get
out of this EO fire 1266?

31:46.940 --> 31:49.600
- So I get about 50 inbound email requests

31:49.600 --> 31:50.433
every single week

31:50.433 --> 31:51.620
of people wanting to be

31:51.620 --> 31:53.037
on Entrepreneur on Fire

31:53.037 --> 31:54.386
or recommending other
people to be on the show,

31:54.386 --> 31:58.170
and this one name kept popping
up over and over again.

31:58.170 --> 32:00.880
Hal Elrod, Hal Elrod, Miracle Morning.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.550
Of my over 1,000 episodes,

32:02.550 --> 32:04.616
his ranks as one of the top 10.

32:04.616 --> 32:07.283
(gentle music)

32:11.020 --> 32:13.760
I spent eight years as an
officer in the US Army.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.301
We had a motto in the army.

32:15.301 --> 32:18.243
We get more stuff done before nine a. m.

32:18.243 --> 32:21.050
than the rest of the world does all day.

32:21.050 --> 32:22.500
I've always been a morning person,

32:22.500 --> 32:24.230
I've always subscribed to that theory,

32:24.230 --> 32:26.670
but the problem was,
especially as an entrepreneur,

32:26.670 --> 32:30.060
like what was I doing with that time

32:30.060 --> 32:31.420
that I was waking up early?

32:31.420 --> 32:33.640
And it wasn't really
that focused of a time.

32:33.640 --> 32:37.030
And that's really what I love
about the Miracle Morning

32:37.030 --> 32:38.560
is that it gave me that direction,

32:38.560 --> 32:39.660
it gave me that focus,

32:39.660 --> 32:40.730
and allowed me to say,

32:40.730 --> 32:41.906
hey, I'm gonna take the hours

32:41.906 --> 32:44.040
that I'm waking up earlier
than everybody else

32:44.040 --> 32:46.913
and actually putting them into
something that's productive.

32:50.770 --> 32:52.205
- The Miracle Morning practices

32:52.205 --> 32:54.882
are like the iron that
smooths out the wrinkles

32:54.882 --> 32:57.960
in an otherwise wrinkly shirt,

32:57.960 --> 32:59.780
which is this life that we live.

32:59.780 --> 33:01.150
It's not brand new

33:01.150 --> 33:02.910
to suddenly be silent in the morning

33:02.910 --> 33:05.060
and to have affirmations and to exercise,

33:05.060 --> 33:06.207
but these are the rituals

33:06.207 --> 33:08.900
of every successful
person you could think of.

33:08.900 --> 33:11.880
It's amazing how fast the changes happen

33:11.880 --> 33:13.070
and you feel it in your head,

33:13.070 --> 33:14.703
the magic that starts to happen.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.720
- So something that people
don't really touch on too much

33:20.720 --> 33:22.200
when it comes to morning routines

33:22.200 --> 33:25.060
is how beneficial it can
be to building habits,

33:25.060 --> 33:26.400
and effective habits, at that.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.080
Again, one of the reasons why
I cherish my mornings so much

33:29.080 --> 33:30.720
is the importance of small wins.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.150
There was an article published

33:32.150 --> 33:33.940
about the importance of small wins

33:33.940 --> 33:36.400
when it came to Michael Phelps' success

33:36.400 --> 33:38.466
where his coach would set up his days

33:38.466 --> 33:40.120
so that when he wakes up in the morning,

33:40.120 --> 33:41.800
he wakes up at the exact same time,

33:41.800 --> 33:43.410
he has the exact same breakfast,

33:43.410 --> 33:46.424
he does his workout down to
the second the exact same way

33:46.424 --> 33:48.210
and these are all small wins.

33:48.210 --> 33:50.400
And by the time he goes
to get in that pool,

33:50.400 --> 33:51.304
he's already won.

33:51.304 --> 33:53.130
- You know, we did the
world's largest study

33:53.130 --> 33:54.450
of high performers,

33:54.450 --> 33:56.317
over 190 countries all around the world

33:56.317 --> 33:59.030
and we studied what is it
that makes people succeed

33:59.030 --> 34:00.510
over the long term?

34:00.510 --> 34:01.810
And it was so clear

34:01.810 --> 34:04.210
that the number one thing
that they were doing

34:04.210 --> 34:05.881
was establishing habits

34:05.881 --> 34:08.840
that help trigger them to be their best.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.600
Whether that for you is
movement, meditation,

34:10.600 --> 34:12.200
writing, scribing, silence.

34:12.200 --> 34:16.360
- These aren't new and
fascinating concepts,

34:16.360 --> 34:17.725
but executing them,

34:17.725 --> 34:19.670
creating a daily habit,

34:19.670 --> 34:20.900
putting them into your life

34:20.900 --> 34:24.230
and having them take effect,

34:24.230 --> 34:26.050
that is where the magic happens.

34:26.050 --> 34:30.510
- What he did was he put into one form

34:30.510 --> 34:34.460
the best ancient wisdom
practices in the world

34:34.460 --> 34:37.070
so I can do 'em every morning,

34:37.070 --> 34:42.070
s-a-v-e-r-s, which fits
my goofy lifestyle.

34:54.705 --> 34:57.170
(mystical music)

34:57.170 --> 35:00.466
- As we've grown and
evolved as human beings,

35:00.466 --> 35:03.315
we've developed morning routines

35:03.315 --> 35:06.480
that take care of our physical space.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.939
I'll give you an example,

35:07.939 --> 35:08.772
you wake up, you brush your teeth,

35:08.772 --> 35:13.010
you shower, you put on
cologne and we head to work.

35:13.010 --> 35:17.140
But if you go back 100
years, all of us would stink.

35:17.140 --> 35:19.410
People would maybe shower once a week.

35:19.410 --> 35:20.370
Now the last 100 years,

35:20.370 --> 35:24.140
we've evolved in terms of how
we treat our physical spaces.

35:24.140 --> 35:24.980
It's rare to meet someone

35:24.980 --> 35:26.640
who doesn't shower every single day.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.930
But here's the problem.

35:27.930 --> 35:31.690
We haven't evolved how we
take care of our minds.

35:31.690 --> 35:34.830
So while we clean our bodies, we wake up,

35:34.830 --> 35:37.720
billions of people wake
up every single day

35:37.720 --> 35:42.610
with their minds filled with
anxiety, fear, stress, worry

35:42.610 --> 35:43.990
and they assume it's normal.

35:43.990 --> 35:47.550
It isn't, these things are not normal

35:47.550 --> 35:50.510
and we need to learn
how to clean our minds,

35:50.510 --> 35:53.000
a mind wash is what meditation does.

35:53.000 --> 35:53.891
The amount of research

35:53.891 --> 35:57.400
showing the benefits of
meditation is just growing.

35:57.400 --> 36:01.720
Last I read, there are
1,400 different studies

36:01.720 --> 36:04.760
on how meditation improves
every aspect of your life,

36:04.760 --> 36:06.940
from your health to longevity,

36:06.940 --> 36:08.830
to the way your heart functions,

36:08.830 --> 36:12.110
to creativity, to happiness levels.

36:12.110 --> 36:14.110
But it's so little understood.

36:14.110 --> 36:16.296
- We have so many thoughts
going on in our head

36:16.296 --> 36:19.890
and we have the idea,
oh well, if I meditate,

36:19.890 --> 36:21.554
I'm not supposed to have any thoughts.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.221
That's not true.

36:23.221 --> 36:25.350
You just learn how to
work with the thoughts.

36:25.350 --> 36:28.500
You learn how to accept
that your mind is active.

36:28.500 --> 36:32.090
- So science is also now
proving that meditation

36:32.090 --> 36:35.520
actually increases different
neurotransmitters in our brain

36:35.520 --> 36:37.960
and that practice of gratitude or prayer

36:37.960 --> 36:41.350
or whatever form of silence
that somebody practices

36:41.350 --> 36:44.000
actually has a physiological
effect in the body.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.320
- Silence is actually
a form of meditation.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.250
And sometimes I will just,

36:49.250 --> 36:51.530
I do many kinds of meditations

36:51.530 --> 36:54.069
and one of them is just
simply to notice the silence.

36:54.069 --> 36:56.880
And in the silence, I
live in a beautiful place,

36:56.880 --> 36:58.650
I can even hear the birds, right,

36:58.650 --> 36:59.630
when the sun is rising?

36:59.630 --> 37:01.053
They will wake up and they sing.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.900
It's extremely soothing to the physiology

37:03.900 --> 37:08.476
to just listen in silence
to the birds singing.

37:08.476 --> 37:11.110
- I believe when you quiet your mind,

37:11.110 --> 37:13.810
it lets the wisdom of God,

37:13.810 --> 37:15.580
the wisdom of infinite intelligence

37:15.580 --> 37:18.970
or higher being, higher power,
wherever you want to call it,

37:18.970 --> 37:21.432
I believe it lets that
spirit into your brain

37:21.432 --> 37:23.930
and you'll kind of have a thought

37:23.930 --> 37:25.850
that if you weren't quiet,

37:25.850 --> 37:27.050
you wouldn't have heard.

37:43.450 --> 37:44.307
- Someone came up to me and they said,

37:44.307 --> 37:46.380
"Hey, do you do live events?"

37:46.380 --> 37:47.720
And I said, "What do you mean?

37:47.720 --> 37:48.703
I mean, I'm speaking at,

37:48.703 --> 37:50.152
I just spoke at this live event,

37:50.152 --> 37:51.155
what do you mean?"

37:51.155 --> 37:51.988
They go, "No, no, no, no, no,

37:51.988 --> 37:53.590
do you actually put on
your own live event?"

37:53.590 --> 37:56.690
So I thought that's a great
idea, doing live events,

37:56.690 --> 37:59.550
and I put on my goals do a live event.

37:59.550 --> 38:00.930
Writing a book is scary.

38:00.930 --> 38:03.160
Pales in comparison to
putting on a live event

38:03.160 --> 38:04.030
because guess what?

38:04.030 --> 38:06.110
You rent a big giant hotel room

38:06.110 --> 38:07.300
and you have to fill it with people.

38:07.300 --> 38:09.080
- He told me that he had a live event

38:09.080 --> 38:10.730
that he had sold 200 tickets to,

38:10.730 --> 38:12.260
he had sold this thing out,

38:12.260 --> 38:14.072
and I said, "What's your
plan for the event?"

38:14.072 --> 38:16.360
And he was still working on that.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.734
- So he said,

38:17.734 --> 38:19.554
"Do you want me to help you
put on your first live event?

38:19.554 --> 38:20.973
And I can kind of work with you on this?"

38:20.973 --> 38:22.550
And he was just gonna advise me at first.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.747
And as we got into advising, I said,

38:24.747 --> 38:26.540
"Will you do this with me?

38:26.540 --> 38:28.320
Will you help me facilitate the event?"

38:28.320 --> 38:29.940
- We had no idea if it was gonna work

38:29.940 --> 38:32.110
even up until the moment
that we were doing it.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.875
And then we were blown away.

38:33.875 --> 38:36.542
(upbeat music)

38:44.300 --> 38:46.020
When a group of people get together

38:46.020 --> 38:47.820
around a higher purpose,

38:47.820 --> 38:51.350
they can't help but see
their own higher purpose

38:51.350 --> 38:53.113
within the vision of that group.

39:00.137 --> 39:01.770
- Almost every person in the audience

39:01.770 --> 39:04.300
was a practitioner of the Miracle Morning.

39:04.300 --> 39:07.750
So I had a 180 Miracle
Morning community members

39:07.750 --> 39:09.095
in that audience.

39:09.095 --> 39:13.480
And I realized wow, this is my community

39:13.480 --> 39:15.330
right here sitting in front of me,

39:15.330 --> 39:17.190
right here sitting with each other,

39:17.190 --> 39:18.420
talking to one another,

39:18.420 --> 39:19.680
supporting each other

39:19.680 --> 39:21.530
with their goals, with their dreams

39:21.530 --> 39:23.191
in having their best year ever.

39:23.191 --> 39:25.910
And the proximity of being close to people

39:25.910 --> 39:27.452
that are likeminded,

39:27.452 --> 39:31.840
that you have a shared
common purpose or objective

39:31.840 --> 39:34.641
or in this case, really practice
being the Miracle Morning,

39:34.641 --> 39:36.610
the closer you get to people

39:36.610 --> 39:38.020
that you're in a community with,

39:38.020 --> 39:41.170
the more you're able to
transform one another's lives.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.393
And that's what our live events have done

39:43.393 --> 39:46.432
for the members of the
Miracle Morning community.

39:46.432 --> 39:51.432
(upbeat music)
(clapping)

40:18.854 --> 40:19.687
- I thought I had headphones.

40:19.687 --> 40:21.975
I'm like, no, I left already.

40:21.975 --> 40:24.558
(bell ringing)

40:27.650 --> 40:29.610
I first heard about the Miracle Morning

40:29.610 --> 40:32.640
from my mom who had read the book,

40:32.640 --> 40:33.860
started practicing it,

40:33.860 --> 40:37.090
and then had my sister and I go on a plane

40:37.090 --> 40:38.615
to the cocreation event.

40:38.615 --> 40:40.900
And that was really cool to see.

40:40.900 --> 40:43.850
We got to meet a whole
bunch of different people

40:43.850 --> 40:46.940
who had their lives impacted
by the Miracle Morning

40:46.940 --> 40:50.780
and by Hal, and we got to
see everything in person.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.817
So that really inspired
us to start doing it

40:53.817 --> 40:55.540
and to start the club.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.390
- They have so much on
their plate these days

40:58.390 --> 41:00.210
and the pressures are so much greater

41:00.210 --> 41:02.935
to get into college and
just finish with high school

41:02.935 --> 41:06.260
with straight A's and SAT
scores and blah, blah, blah.

41:06.260 --> 41:09.650
- I know mornings are one
of the most difficult times

41:09.650 --> 41:12.010
for kids to get out of bed

41:12.010 --> 41:15.130
and be functioning in the mornings.

41:15.130 --> 41:18.070
- She was always the last one out the door

41:18.070 --> 41:20.970
basically running by the counter,
grabbing something to eat

41:20.970 --> 41:21.993
and she's out.

41:22.831 --> 41:24.290
She's now up before Michelle,

41:24.290 --> 41:26.480
she's out and with a half an hour leeway,

41:26.480 --> 41:27.980
calmly packing up her stuff,

41:27.980 --> 41:31.350
calmly having a sit down
breakfast, ready to go.

41:31.350 --> 41:34.450
- They started us off by
going through the SAVERS

41:34.450 --> 41:37.300
and teaching us different
techniques to do that.

41:37.300 --> 41:40.410
- As their mom, I see the
changes in both my girls

41:40.410 --> 41:45.410
to be more intentional,
more mature, more calm,

41:47.270 --> 41:48.710
less distracted,

41:48.710 --> 41:52.610
definitely more aware of who they are

41:52.610 --> 41:54.770
and how they go about their day,

41:54.770 --> 41:56.889
more self aware in their own actions.

41:56.889 --> 41:59.223
- Goodbye Hal, I love you.

41:59.223 --> 42:00.231
- Goodbye Hal.

42:00.231 --> 42:01.064
- Bye Hal.

42:15.478 --> 42:18.561
(gentle piano music)

42:29.600 --> 42:31.960
- My morning routine has
changed over the years.

42:31.960 --> 42:33.690
When I was a professional athlete

42:33.690 --> 42:35.060
and I was actively boxing,

42:35.060 --> 42:37.570
I always had a routine because
I had to get up and run,

42:37.570 --> 42:39.700
I had to go to the boxing
gym and I had to work out.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.990
So that's what my day was centered around.

42:41.990 --> 42:42.960
Now things are different

42:42.960 --> 42:45.000
because I'm a business woman, I'm a mom.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.310
I have a million things
going on all the time,

42:47.310 --> 42:48.143
but in the morning,

42:48.143 --> 42:51.230
it's a great time for me
to just really get centered

42:51.230 --> 42:53.700
and think, okay, what
are my short term goals

42:53.700 --> 42:55.260
and my long term goals,

42:55.260 --> 42:57.630
making sure that I'm kind
of keeping myself in check.

42:57.630 --> 42:59.910
Because what happens when
I didn't have routine

42:59.910 --> 43:02.140
is that you kind of just
lose track of everything.

43:02.140 --> 43:03.630
You have the best intentions,

43:03.630 --> 43:05.960
but you don't have any way
to kind of check yourself

43:05.960 --> 43:07.610
and make sure that you're doing the things

43:07.610 --> 43:09.341
that you say you want to do.

43:09.341 --> 43:11.731
Let's see, what was one
of my latest affirmations?

43:11.731 --> 43:14.200
I will learn how to say no

43:14.200 --> 43:16.140
to the things I didn't want to do.

43:16.140 --> 43:17.010
It can be anything.

43:17.010 --> 43:18.677
It's just kind of a reminder for yourself

43:18.677 --> 43:20.810
and the more you say it,
the more you believe it

43:20.810 --> 43:22.903
and it's embedded in you.

43:29.976 --> 43:32.690
- We have 60,000 thoughts a day.

43:32.690 --> 43:34.740
Our minds are always thinking.

43:34.740 --> 43:38.330
And for the average person,
80% of those are negative.

43:38.330 --> 43:40.208
We have a negativity bias

43:40.208 --> 43:44.220
that we inherited from
our caveman ancestors.

43:44.220 --> 43:48.547
The mind can't distinguish
between real and imagined.

43:48.547 --> 43:53.547
So if you say I am dumb, your
mind accepts that as truth.

43:55.460 --> 43:59.900
If you say I am smart, your
mind accepts that as truth.

43:59.900 --> 44:02.740
I spend a lot of time during my day

44:02.740 --> 44:06.211
saying things like I am filled with love,

44:06.211 --> 44:08.467
I am filled with grace.

44:08.467 --> 44:11.929
Another beautiful form of
affirmation is gratitude.

44:11.929 --> 44:14.870
I'm grateful for this day.

44:14.870 --> 44:16.947
I'm grateful for my life.

44:16.947 --> 44:18.570
I am alive.

44:18.570 --> 44:22.540
I am healthy in my body, heart and spirit.

44:22.540 --> 44:25.240
Anything that helps you feel more aligned

44:25.240 --> 44:26.980
with the you that you want to be,

44:26.980 --> 44:29.710
the you that you want to
live out during your day,

44:29.710 --> 44:33.223
that is a beautiful form of affirmation.

44:35.667 --> 44:38.273
- (speaking in foreign
language) live modestly.

44:42.292 --> 44:47.292
On December 31st of 2020,
we'll be completely debt free.

44:47.410 --> 44:50.493
This is a big number but
I am not afraid of it.

44:53.202 --> 44:55.020
I think the Miracle Morning works

44:55.020 --> 44:57.776
because it's just a proven framework

44:57.776 --> 45:01.283
for a complete mindset change.

45:02.678 --> 45:06.940
Miracle Morning helped me
get through depression,

45:06.940 --> 45:10.470
helped me to become a better
father and a better husband,

45:10.470 --> 45:14.000
and it also helped me
find a purpose in life

45:14.000 --> 45:16.863
through my business and serving others.

45:18.143 --> 45:22.274
I'm a good man who loves to serve.

45:22.274 --> 45:25.493
I will prioritize serving others first.

45:25.493 --> 45:28.793
- I think the best thing about
the Miracle Morning for him

45:28.793 --> 45:32.030
is that it gave him a
platform to find that purpose.

45:32.030 --> 45:37.030
And now Keith is generous and
kind and thankful and giving

45:37.280 --> 45:39.200
and he's helpful around the house,

45:39.200 --> 45:41.043
which has been an amazing change.

45:47.840 --> 45:48.690
- Who is Everett?

45:51.730 --> 45:52.613
- He's my son.

45:54.573 --> 45:56.463
- Tell me who is Everett.

45:59.723 --> 46:02.193
- Everett is our third son.

46:03.918 --> 46:06.900
He made it all the way through birth

46:06.900 --> 46:11.760
and he lived for three
hours and it was amazing,

46:11.760 --> 46:12.730
it was horrible,

46:12.730 --> 46:15.883
it was the best worst thing
that ever happened to us.

46:17.761 --> 46:22.700
- He allowed us to
understand what grace meant.

46:26.112 --> 46:30.940
He allowed us to improve our marriage

46:30.940 --> 46:32.353
for Kim and I, for sure.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.840
- Keith certainly went

46:40.840 --> 46:44.890
through a period of depression
and frustration and anger,

46:44.890 --> 46:48.190
I think probably like most dads would.

46:48.190 --> 46:51.670
He really began questioning
life and purpose.

46:51.670 --> 46:52.580
- I was mad.

46:52.580 --> 46:53.440
I was mad at God.

46:53.440 --> 46:56.855
I was mad at people that said,

46:56.855 --> 46:59.573
God had a plan, something like that,

46:59.573 --> 47:01.120
and that's the last thing
that I wanted to hear.

47:01.120 --> 47:03.460
I wish that I had the SAVERS

47:03.460 --> 47:04.850
and the Miracle Morning back then,

47:04.850 --> 47:07.620
because I would've probably
been able to process that

47:07.620 --> 47:09.153
a lot differently than I did.

47:10.031 --> 47:12.614
(gentle music)

47:16.560 --> 47:19.437
Everett died in 2012

47:19.437 --> 47:22.591
and I started the Miracle
Morning last year in 2015.

47:22.591 --> 47:24.100
So there was about a three year period

47:24.100 --> 47:27.550
where I felt complete discontent.

47:27.550 --> 47:30.250
Almost on the first day, it was this big,

47:30.250 --> 47:31.083
it's almost like somebody

47:31.083 --> 47:33.674
took this big weight off of my chest

47:33.674 --> 47:38.674
because I had gone through
the process of mindfulness,

47:40.000 --> 47:43.430
of affirmation, of visualization.

47:43.430 --> 47:46.400
I actually can now see myself
doing something in the future

47:46.400 --> 47:48.010
and that lit a fire in me.

47:48.010 --> 47:49.725
And after that fire was lit,

47:49.725 --> 47:53.100
it just continued to grow.

47:53.100 --> 47:56.207
- I think the biggest changes
with the Miracle Morning

47:56.207 --> 47:59.130
was the peace that came.

47:59.130 --> 48:01.310
He's softer to other people.

48:01.310 --> 48:06.310
He is compassionate a bit more
maybe than he was previously,

48:07.700 --> 48:09.727
even though he was kind.

48:09.727 --> 48:11.187
- I'm trying to.

48:11.187 --> 48:14.365
Alright, we got you some more meat.

48:14.365 --> 48:16.245
- Thank you, my friend.

48:16.245 --> 48:19.326
- I almost had a Kevlar,
a Bulletproof vest on

48:19.326 --> 48:24.326
of positive affirmational
just mental awareness

48:24.850 --> 48:26.470
of who I was.

48:26.470 --> 48:30.140
And that allowed me to pull
myself up out of depression.

48:30.140 --> 48:32.750
And I I haven't been there since.

48:32.750 --> 48:34.470
Even through starting a business.

48:34.470 --> 48:36.720
I've had my ups and downs, trust me,

48:36.720 --> 48:40.080
and the affirmation component

48:40.080 --> 48:43.800
and the visualization and the
meditation, all the SAVERS,

48:43.800 --> 48:47.173
has helped those downs
become not very long.

48:51.007 --> 48:53.710
- And so what if you could
do that for every single day?

48:53.710 --> 48:55.810
What if before you went to bed at night

48:55.810 --> 48:57.290
you established the thought as

48:57.290 --> 48:59.720
how am I gonna make tomorrow awesome?

48:59.720 --> 49:01.530
Like, what's the one thing
that's gonna happen tomorrow

49:01.530 --> 49:03.350
that I'm really excited about?

49:03.350 --> 49:05.106
That I want to wake up for.

49:05.106 --> 49:07.070
Imagine if that was the last thought

49:07.070 --> 49:07.970
that you went to bed with,

49:07.970 --> 49:09.020
not oh my God,

49:09.020 --> 49:10.340
think about all of this stuff

49:10.340 --> 49:11.884
that I need to get done tomorrow.

49:11.884 --> 49:16.020
So one unexpected way that
we really got the word out

49:16.020 --> 49:18.930
about the Miracle Morning
came from one of my friends.

49:18.930 --> 49:20.044
And he said,

49:20.044 --> 49:22.240
"I've shared the book with
everyone on my sales team.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.450
Almost every single
one of our sales people

49:24.450 --> 49:26.710
that's read the book, their
sales have increased. "

49:26.710 --> 49:27.543
He goes, "What about doing

49:27.543 --> 49:29.242
like a Miracle Morning for salespeople?"

49:29.242 --> 49:30.075
And he said,

49:30.075 --> 49:31.450
"And customizing the Miracle Morning

49:31.450 --> 49:32.660
with affirmations and everything

49:32.660 --> 49:34.770
that were designed for
increasing your sales

49:34.770 --> 49:36.880
and being successful as a salesperson. "

49:36.880 --> 49:39.801
And I said, "That sounds
like a great idea, sure.

49:39.801 --> 49:42.630
You want to coauthor it with me, why not?"

49:42.630 --> 49:44.220
Then I met Honoree Corder

49:44.220 --> 49:47.500
and it really feels now like serendipity.

49:47.500 --> 49:50.210
- I am the cocreator of the
"Miracle Morning" book series.

49:50.210 --> 49:52.990
We have almost a dozen
titles in the series.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.460
We started with the "Miracle
Morning for Real Estate Agents"

49:55.460 --> 49:57.580
and then salespeople and
then network marketers

49:57.580 --> 49:58.704
and then we went to writing

49:58.704 --> 50:02.570
and then we did a the "Miracle
Morning for Entrepreneurs",

50:02.570 --> 50:03.577
parents and families,

50:03.577 --> 50:05.584
"The Art of Affirmations Coloring Book"

50:05.584 --> 50:09.420
and coming up next is one that is really,

50:09.420 --> 50:11.820
I'm really fond of this
coauthor and of this book,

50:11.820 --> 50:13.983
it's "The Miracle Morning
for College Students. "

50:13.983 --> 50:16.130
We've heard for thousands of years

50:16.130 --> 50:18.610
to practice any one of the life SAVERS

50:18.610 --> 50:20.257
and I think the reason
that the Miracle Morning

50:20.257 --> 50:22.610
and the life SAVERS message resonates

50:22.610 --> 50:24.030
is not really about the message

50:24.030 --> 50:25.330
because it's not a new message.

50:25.330 --> 50:26.640
It's because the messenger

50:26.640 --> 50:29.013
is such a powerful messenger.

50:49.302 --> 50:53.550
- Our morning routine starts
with a variation of things.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.580
The main thought that
starts it off though,

50:55.580 --> 50:58.213
is we have a rule that
nothing enters our world

50:58.213 --> 51:00.180
until we're full.

51:00.180 --> 51:01.630
And the analogy I've always used

51:01.630 --> 51:02.900
is if you took a soda can

51:02.900 --> 51:05.100
and you opened it up
and you emptied it out

51:05.100 --> 51:07.600
and you hand that small can to a child,

51:07.600 --> 51:11.000
the child can easily dent it,
if not crush the whole can.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.550
Versus if you take the same can,

51:12.550 --> 51:15.430
fill it all the way up,
pressurize it and seal it,

51:15.430 --> 51:17.940
now that child has a very
little chance of denting it

51:17.940 --> 51:20.390
and almost impossible for
that child to crush it.

51:35.334 --> 51:36.420
And so my thought is

51:36.420 --> 51:38.960
what's everything that can
fit into that morning routine

51:38.960 --> 51:42.150
that fills you up, fuels
you up, pressurizes you

51:42.150 --> 51:45.550
with awesome, great,
powerful pressure pushing out

51:45.550 --> 51:47.380
so that all the natural pressures

51:47.380 --> 51:48.570
that life puts on you

51:48.570 --> 51:51.830
is easily and effortlessly forged through

51:51.830 --> 51:53.180
by that almost force field

51:53.180 --> 51:54.980
you've created around you of energy.

51:56.230 --> 51:58.257
Now treadmill desk is set up

51:58.257 --> 52:00.258
and if you see, I have my
vision boards wrapped around it.

52:00.258 --> 52:03.170
This is me looking way
out into the future.

52:03.170 --> 52:05.640
What's the ultimate vision
of what life looks like?

52:05.640 --> 52:07.250
And I'll start doing affirmations

52:07.250 --> 52:08.410
and incantations about this,

52:08.410 --> 52:10.050
where I'm activating my body,

52:10.050 --> 52:11.690
I'm looking at a visual image

52:11.690 --> 52:13.600
of what that future point looks like

52:13.600 --> 52:16.070
and then I'm physically
feeling it in my body

52:16.070 --> 52:17.040
while saying it

52:17.040 --> 52:20.000
and getting that vibrational
energy to move inside of me

52:20.000 --> 52:21.100
so I can feel it at the same time.

52:21.100 --> 52:23.870
So I'm trying to see it,
feel it, activate it.

52:23.870 --> 52:25.840
And if you go to the
science aspect of this,

52:25.840 --> 52:27.120
all I'm doing is trying to activate

52:27.120 --> 52:29.020
as many lobes in my brain as possible.

52:31.920 --> 52:34.190
- Having visualizations tends to set

52:34.190 --> 52:36.350
literally visual scenery

52:36.350 --> 52:38.240
on the back of the visual cortex.

52:38.240 --> 52:40.110
And from the point of
view of a neuroscientist

52:40.110 --> 52:41.900
either doing fMRI or EEG,

52:41.900 --> 52:43.100
the brain patterns produced

52:43.100 --> 52:44.700
when you're imagining a scene

52:44.700 --> 52:47.560
are actually the same as when
you're seeing that thing.

52:47.560 --> 52:48.780
So you're teaching your brain

52:48.780 --> 52:50.522
how to get used to the ideas

52:50.522 --> 52:53.593
that you'd like to eventually accomplish.

52:54.938 --> 52:56.480
- Who has a vision board

52:56.480 --> 52:59.199
that not all the visions
have quite come true yet?

52:59.199 --> 53:01.140
Right, and who has a vision board

53:01.140 --> 53:05.000
that it just like, it's
actually an invisible board?

53:05.000 --> 53:06.170
'Cause it's been there so long,

53:06.170 --> 53:07.003
you walk by it,

53:07.003 --> 53:08.920
you don't even see it anymore, right?

53:08.920 --> 53:09.980
That's what happened to me.

53:09.980 --> 53:12.030
So visualize not just the end result,

53:12.030 --> 53:14.477
close your eyes and
visualize the daily activity.

53:14.477 --> 53:16.830
One of the things that
we found unquestionably

53:16.830 --> 53:20.110
is a high performers have
a high level of intention

53:20.110 --> 53:21.147
for their day.

53:21.147 --> 53:23.560
But what I do is I look at my calendar

53:23.560 --> 53:25.200
or I look at my task or my to do's

53:25.200 --> 53:26.970
or my priorities that day

53:26.970 --> 53:30.090
and I simply walk through it in my mind.

53:30.090 --> 53:31.930
Like, what's the mindset
I'll need to be in?

53:31.930 --> 53:33.850
What's the value I'll want to add?

53:33.850 --> 53:35.750
How do I want to demonstrate myself?

53:35.750 --> 53:38.090
How do I want to feel during that?

53:38.090 --> 53:41.378
You know, by walking
through the day like that,

53:41.378 --> 53:43.938
it's more powerful for me

53:43.938 --> 53:45.938
because I find that I'm more intentional

53:55.138 --> 53:57.888
(water bubbling)

54:11.319 --> 54:12.152
- My name is Risa.

54:12.152 --> 54:14.338
I am a mother of two boys.

54:14.338 --> 54:17.030
I am a motivational speaker.

54:17.030 --> 54:18.320
Most of you know my story

54:18.320 --> 54:21.378
that I was sick and I
was supposed to be blind

54:21.378 --> 54:24.730
but God rescued me from blindness

54:25.620 --> 54:28.470
and I received donated eyes

54:28.470 --> 54:30.690
from the United States of America.

54:30.690 --> 54:34.423
So my sight and my life is a miracle.

54:36.877 --> 54:40.460
I had undergone a
separation in my marriage

54:41.470 --> 54:43.300
and also I had lost my job.

54:43.300 --> 54:45.703
So I was in a very serious depression.

54:46.650 --> 54:48.010
There was no one else to turn to,

54:48.010 --> 54:51.100
so I went to Google and I typed

54:51.100 --> 54:52.910
how to get out of depression.

54:52.910 --> 54:54.260
That's when I had suggestions

54:54.260 --> 54:57.227
and part of it was "The Miracle Morning".

54:59.140 --> 55:01.070
In the morning when I wake up,

55:01.070 --> 55:04.746
the first thing I do is
take a glass of water

55:04.746 --> 55:07.223
and then brush my teeth.

55:08.120 --> 55:12.040
And after that, I pray, I read the Bible

55:12.040 --> 55:17.040
and then I do meditation
and then affirmations.

55:18.870 --> 55:23.800
The positive energy around
me is continuously expanding.

55:23.800 --> 55:27.023
And then I do visualization.

55:28.340 --> 55:30.060
I've always wanted to travel the world

55:30.060 --> 55:33.513
so I always visualize myself
with airplanes and all that.

55:35.261 --> 55:39.480
"The Miracle Morning"
has helped me realize

55:39.480 --> 55:43.210
how important I am as an individual

55:43.210 --> 55:46.480
and also to appreciate myself as a mother.

55:46.480 --> 55:48.450
My children are more happier

55:48.450 --> 55:50.710
and they have a very strong foundation.

55:50.710 --> 55:53.703
They know that I love them
and they love me back.

56:12.620 --> 56:16.583
- Wow, this is crazy.

56:18.827 --> 56:23.673
"The Miracle Morning" in
Korean, the Korean edition.

56:26.760 --> 56:28.083
This is surreal.

56:29.040 --> 56:32.216
We just signed with 19 foreign publishers

56:32.216 --> 56:34.390
and "The Miracle Morning" is gonna publish

56:34.390 --> 56:37.523
in 19 countries, 17 translations.

56:41.909 --> 56:43.181
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:43.181 --> 56:44.210
- Perfect.

56:44.210 --> 56:47.181
- Okay bye guy, you guys be good.

56:47.181 --> 56:49.020
- We are going to Paris to film
"The Miracle Morning" movie

56:49.020 --> 56:49.900
and spread the movement.

56:49.900 --> 56:51.670
I got the filmmaker in the back.

56:51.670 --> 56:52.503
Will, where are you?

56:52.503 --> 56:54.670
There he is, filming right now.

56:54.670 --> 56:56.147
It's gonna be an adventure.

56:59.936 --> 57:02.370
- Hey, we're on the camera.

57:02.370 --> 57:04.150
We're going to Paris.

57:04.150 --> 57:05.900
- We are underneath the Eiffel tower.

57:05.900 --> 57:07.280
There's my beautiful bride.

57:07.280 --> 57:10.510
- It's actually a marathon three
days for me with the media.

57:10.510 --> 57:13.800
So I'm meeting with television
stations and radio stations

57:13.800 --> 57:17.200
and I've got to sign 200 books
this afternoon for Amazon

57:17.200 --> 57:19.540
and then I do a more TV and radio.

57:19.540 --> 57:21.920
So yeah, it's a pretty
nonstop the next three days

57:21.920 --> 57:24.040
and I'll sleep on the way home.

57:24.040 --> 57:26.873
(whimsical music)

57:33.720 --> 57:35.240
- And I read your book last September

57:35.240 --> 57:36.310
and it changed my life.

57:36.310 --> 57:37.390
- Wow.
- It did.

57:37.390 --> 57:39.003
- Hug for that, that's amazing.

57:42.396 --> 57:44.280
Anyone can do it,

57:44.280 --> 57:48.015
especially if you don't consider
yourself a morning person.

57:48.015 --> 57:52.250
(speaking in foreign language)

57:52.250 --> 57:56.400
- We are now official and bestseller list

57:56.400 --> 57:58.200
to Amazon in France.

57:58.200 --> 58:00.483
It's very nice and very great.

58:04.310 --> 58:05.640
- The last few days

58:05.640 --> 58:09.170
have been beyond anything I ever imagined.

58:09.170 --> 58:10.850
And I don't know what
I would have imagined.

58:10.850 --> 58:12.600
I mean, it was a media tour

58:12.600 --> 58:16.770
to spread "The Miracle Morning"
throughout Paris, France.

58:16.770 --> 58:19.550
I've never done anything like that before.

58:19.550 --> 58:22.670
I really did try to treat every interview,

58:22.670 --> 58:25.720
every opportunity, every experience

58:25.720 --> 58:30.720
as the most important of
my life, of being here,

58:30.920 --> 58:34.110
because I wanted to make sure
that I reached and impacted

58:34.110 --> 58:35.520
as many people in France,

58:35.520 --> 58:37.810
as I possibly could with
"The Miracle Morning".

58:37.810 --> 58:39.338
You work so hard,

58:39.338 --> 58:44.130
you follow your passion and
your dreams for so long,

58:44.130 --> 58:46.790
and almost as soon as you get

58:46.790 --> 58:49.670
to the place you've been
working for, it switches,

58:49.670 --> 58:52.050
your emotions switch from this desire

58:52.050 --> 58:54.330
to the fear of losing it all.

58:54.330 --> 58:55.260
And "The Miracle Morning",

58:55.260 --> 58:57.250
especially the use of affirmations,

58:57.250 --> 59:00.560
enables me to address my
fears in writing every day

59:00.560 --> 59:03.160
and remind myself that
the fears are in my head,

59:03.160 --> 59:04.000
they're in my mind,

59:04.000 --> 59:05.520
and that life has proven

59:05.520 --> 59:07.540
that if you continue to do good things

59:07.540 --> 59:09.480
and put good out into the universe

59:09.480 --> 59:11.871
and work hard and move toward the,

59:11.871 --> 59:14.490
move confidently in the
direction of your dreams

59:14.490 --> 59:17.960
as Henry Thoreau once
said, that life rewards you

59:17.960 --> 59:20.160
and that everything
works out for the best,

59:20.160 --> 59:21.200
even though it's never perfect,

59:21.200 --> 59:23.650
there's always challenge
and obstacles along the way,

59:23.650 --> 59:26.373
you eventually get where
you're moving towards.

59:41.779 --> 59:43.490
- I was born into a body

59:43.490 --> 59:45.980
that most people would
say is a perfect body

59:45.980 --> 59:48.180
to have an excuse not to workout.

59:48.180 --> 59:49.530
You know, they'd be like, aw Shawn,

59:49.530 --> 59:51.330
look at that, you're three feet tall,

59:51.330 --> 59:52.626
you're in a wheelchair,

59:52.626 --> 59:56.290
if you didn't work out, nobody
would get on you about it.

59:56.290 --> 59:57.850
And that's sad

59:58.706 --> 1:00:01.860
because who better to be working out

1:00:01.860 --> 1:00:05.470
than somebody who spends
most of their day in a chair.

1:00:05.470 --> 1:00:08.390
And so my mentality is if I can move this,

1:00:08.390 --> 1:00:11.250
if I am blessed enough to
be able to lift something,

1:00:11.250 --> 1:00:14.240
stretch, pull, do whatever I gotta do,

1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:15.570
then I'm gonna use it.

1:00:15.570 --> 1:00:20.040
This body is a taxi
cab that I am riding in

1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:22.460
during this time around.

1:00:22.460 --> 1:00:25.460
And so I want to keep
the cab running smooth,

1:00:25.460 --> 1:00:26.810
I want to keep it clean.

1:00:26.810 --> 1:00:29.063
I want to have a good
time in this vehicle.

1:00:30.727 --> 1:00:35.310
I use air pumps as like chest press.

1:00:35.310 --> 1:00:38.853
I use pulleys and sandbags for weights.

1:00:40.510 --> 1:00:44.120
Self care, which you would
say are your morning rituals,

1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:46.090
is the cure to insecurity.

1:00:46.090 --> 1:00:48.130
When you're taking great care of yourself,

1:00:48.130 --> 1:00:51.160
the less your insecurities
start to surface

1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:52.870
and tell you you're not enough.

1:00:52.870 --> 1:00:54.370
And I think at the end of the day,

1:00:54.370 --> 1:00:56.770
people who don't want to exercise

1:00:56.770 --> 1:00:59.530
they're basically writing
out a prescription

1:00:59.530 --> 1:01:01.570
for their own depression.

1:01:01.570 --> 1:01:04.110
- If you exercise first
thing in the morning,

1:01:04.110 --> 1:01:07.140
the positive benefits from that commitment

1:01:07.140 --> 1:01:11.190
sometimes last up to 15 hours
after the initial exercise.

1:01:11.190 --> 1:01:13.020
So just by that morning ritual

1:01:13.020 --> 1:01:15.010
of getting involved in
that intense exercise,

1:01:15.010 --> 1:01:17.230
creating that pharmacy of mastery,

1:01:17.230 --> 1:01:20.560
which releases dopamine, the
inspirational neurotransmitter,

1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:23.780
serotonin which calms you down
and helps you fight stress,

1:01:23.780 --> 1:01:25.960
BDNF, which amplifies your brain,

1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:27.960
so you're thinking like a superhero.

1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:30.840
I mean, what would that do for you alone?

1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:31.870
It not only does that,

1:01:31.870 --> 1:01:33.560
it actually increases your metabolic rate

1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:34.393
first thing in the morning.

1:01:34.393 --> 1:01:36.350
So you burn fat much more quickly,

1:01:36.350 --> 1:01:38.080
which is key for a lot of people.

1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:39.690
We all have greatness within us.

1:01:39.690 --> 1:01:41.690
I believe a lot of people
are going through their lives

1:01:41.690 --> 1:01:44.510
and they sort of resign
themselves to being average.

1:01:44.510 --> 1:01:45.440
And they just think people,

1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:46.730
like the great entrepreneurs

1:01:46.730 --> 1:01:49.700
and the great heroes and
the great humanitarians

1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:53.430
and the great scientists are
cut from a different cloth.

1:01:53.430 --> 1:01:55.848
And what a lot of good
research is starting to show us

1:01:55.848 --> 1:02:00.347
is you don't get lucky, you create lucky.

1:02:00.347 --> 1:02:02.190
And if you look at the superstars,

1:02:02.190 --> 1:02:03.192
the great performers,

1:02:03.192 --> 1:02:07.130
they're not cut from any kind
of a different cloth or DNA,

1:02:07.130 --> 1:02:09.170
they're just running different habits.

1:02:09.170 --> 1:02:11.890
- (announcer mumbling)

1:02:11.890 --> 1:02:14.110
and Lewis Howes takes it to the house.

1:02:14.110 --> 1:02:16.511
- Well I just think when
we have a big dream,

1:02:16.511 --> 1:02:20.757
we need to have the energy in
order to make it come to life.

1:02:20.757 --> 1:02:22.958
And so exercise for me is,

1:02:22.958 --> 1:02:25.700
it's just a nonnegotiable.

1:02:25.700 --> 1:02:26.533
We only have one life

1:02:26.533 --> 1:02:28.410
and if we're not taking
care of our own body,

1:02:28.410 --> 1:02:29.995
then it's not gonna take care of us.

1:02:29.995 --> 1:02:31.570
And it's gonna hold us back

1:02:31.570 --> 1:02:34.193
from achieving the dreams that we want.

1:02:34.193 --> 1:02:37.026
(inspiring music)

1:02:43.974 --> 1:02:46.641
(alarm beeping)

1:03:04.990 --> 1:03:07.160
- Through "The Miracle
Morning" and my routine,

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:09.253
I lost 90 pounds in eight months.

1:03:11.185 --> 1:03:13.900
Not only did I lose the
weight and keep it off,

1:03:13.900 --> 1:03:15.260
but I changed my lifestyle

1:03:15.260 --> 1:03:17.080
and haven't wanted to,

1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:18.953
or even considered turning back.

1:03:21.564 --> 1:03:24.760
I posted a picture in "The
Miracle Morning" Facebook group

1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:28.400
and I got like 700 and
something likes like instantly,

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:29.930
hey that's amazing what you've done.

1:03:29.930 --> 1:03:31.590
And in that moment, it clicked for me.

1:03:31.590 --> 1:03:35.370
I had spent my whole life
being inspired by other people

1:03:35.370 --> 1:03:37.550
but I never realized that by talking

1:03:37.550 --> 1:03:40.490
about struggling with my
weight my entire life,

1:03:40.490 --> 1:03:43.480
and then finally finding a solution

1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:48.123
in the Miracle Morning could
give other people hope.

1:03:48.123 --> 1:03:51.990
So I always did stuff so
that people would like me.

1:03:51.990 --> 1:03:54.171
Like, I thought that
that's how you got value

1:03:54.171 --> 1:03:56.780
was you had to perform.

1:03:56.780 --> 1:03:59.490
So like, I was always the class clown.

1:03:59.490 --> 1:04:02.066
- You got to do a front flip, belly flop.

1:04:02.066 --> 1:04:03.784
- Don't do a belly flop.

1:04:03.784 --> 1:04:04.617
Oh.

1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:07.473
- Oh my God.

1:04:07.473 --> 1:04:08.850
(yelling)

1:04:08.850 --> 1:04:11.570
- And while it's all like
funny to look back and laugh at

1:04:11.570 --> 1:04:13.969
like I was so desperate for attention

1:04:13.969 --> 1:04:16.070
that all that was okay.

1:04:16.070 --> 1:04:18.710
Like it didn't matter that
like I was a human being

1:04:18.710 --> 1:04:22.010
or I put myself in danger or
that like could have drowned,

1:04:22.010 --> 1:04:23.290
I could have died from impact.

1:04:23.290 --> 1:04:26.000
Like people can fall from 10 feet and die

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:27.926
and I just jumped off a 40 foot cliff

1:04:27.926 --> 1:04:31.220
because I wanted people to like me.

1:04:31.220 --> 1:04:33.249
I was also like a really angry person,

1:04:33.249 --> 1:04:36.513
like I was so just furious.

1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:39.280
And I think a lot of that came

1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:41.462
from feeling like the
world owed me something,

1:04:41.462 --> 1:04:43.407
but I never did anything about getting it.

1:04:43.407 --> 1:04:45.931
And so I saw other
people that had gotten it

1:04:45.931 --> 1:04:47.054
and I was angry at them.

1:04:47.054 --> 1:04:49.100
Like I didn't want
other people to be happy

1:04:49.100 --> 1:04:51.510
because I didn't feel like
I knew how to be happy,

1:04:51.510 --> 1:04:52.770
so why should they?

1:04:52.770 --> 1:04:56.060
So I found Miracle Morning and
then I knew how to be happy.

1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:57.960
I used to live with this concept

1:04:57.960 --> 1:05:00.527
that everybody was either
better than or worse than me.

1:05:00.527 --> 1:05:02.240
And so I was always just on this ladder

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:03.140
trying to move up

1:05:03.140 --> 1:05:04.720
and trying to be better than other people.

1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:06.810
And there's not that same element

1:05:06.810 --> 1:05:08.570
of competition in my life anymore.

1:05:08.570 --> 1:05:11.640
Like I'm not on a ladder,
I'm on a landscape

1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:13.830
and we're all going forward.

1:05:13.830 --> 1:05:15.770
And like I get to be a part of that

1:05:15.770 --> 1:05:17.707
instead of being against it.

1:05:17.707 --> 1:05:20.760
I'm not angry at other
people for being happy.

1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:23.325
I'm sad when I see them
not realizing their dreams

1:05:23.325 --> 1:05:25.043
and I want to bring them with me.

1:05:31.059 --> 1:05:33.892
(whimsical music)

1:05:45.910 --> 1:05:50.020
- Great lives are created
one great day after another

1:05:50.020 --> 1:05:52.900
and those great days
start with great mornings.

1:05:52.900 --> 1:05:54.680
Miracle mornings are created

1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:57.970
by systematically installing new habits.

1:05:57.970 --> 1:06:00.180
I think the Miracle Morning
has impacted so many lives

1:06:00.180 --> 1:06:02.350
because it's awesome, it works.

1:06:02.350 --> 1:06:04.680
If you put together this SAVERS model

1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:07.050
and you start your day with these rhythms,

1:06:07.050 --> 1:06:09.173
you will have better days period.

1:06:10.369 --> 1:06:12.470
So I think reading is essential.

1:06:12.470 --> 1:06:14.460
I think it's an essential
part of the SAVERS model.

1:06:14.460 --> 1:06:16.490
Hal suggests 10 to 15 minutes a day.

1:06:16.490 --> 1:06:19.260
You compound 10 to 15 minutes a day,

1:06:19.260 --> 1:06:20.160
over the course of a year,

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:21.740
that's a ton of reading.

1:06:21.740 --> 1:06:24.190
And we need to realize
that any one big idea

1:06:24.190 --> 1:06:25.310
that we read from someone

1:06:25.310 --> 1:06:27.450
who spent a lot of time figuring it out

1:06:27.450 --> 1:06:28.767
can literally change our lives.

1:06:28.767 --> 1:06:30.730
And you find that one little idea

1:06:30.730 --> 1:06:32.410
that either affirms
something you already knew

1:06:32.410 --> 1:06:35.550
or maybe introduce you to new
idea, and you implement that,

1:06:35.550 --> 1:06:38.660
you compound that over
months and years and decades,

1:06:38.660 --> 1:06:41.010
and it's truly astonishing
what you can create.

1:06:48.690 --> 1:06:49.640
- I come across people,

1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:50.960
what's your favorite book?

1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:52.830
You know, what's the best book
you've read in the last year?

1:06:52.830 --> 1:06:53.663
And they'll be like,

1:06:53.663 --> 1:06:55.340
"Well, I haven't read a
book in the last year. "

1:06:55.340 --> 1:06:58.870
And it's mind boggling to me
that that that even exists

1:06:58.870 --> 1:07:00.940
in places where people
actually know how to read

1:07:00.940 --> 1:07:02.580
and they have access to books.

1:07:02.580 --> 1:07:03.860
The second way to learn

1:07:03.860 --> 1:07:05.980
is through the experiences
of other people.

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:07.940
You read their books,
you go to their seminars,

1:07:07.940 --> 1:07:08.773
you listen to them.

1:07:08.773 --> 1:07:10.570
And then the third and most effective

1:07:10.570 --> 1:07:12.000
and efficient way to learn something

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.220
is once you learn something,

1:07:13.220 --> 1:07:14.830
you teach it to someone else.

1:07:14.830 --> 1:07:17.324
Okay, because that
reinforces your knowledge.

1:07:17.324 --> 1:07:19.020
Most people that are readers,

1:07:19.020 --> 1:07:20.940
they can point to a book

1:07:20.940 --> 1:07:23.180
that has actually changed their thinking,

1:07:23.180 --> 1:07:24.530
the direction, their knowledge.

1:07:24.530 --> 1:07:26.050
And so when I read a book

1:07:26.050 --> 1:07:28.380
it's really about trying
to improve myself.

1:07:28.380 --> 1:07:30.350
I'm trying to actually learn something.

1:07:30.350 --> 1:07:33.110
And it could either be
a negative aspect of me

1:07:33.110 --> 1:07:34.750
that I'm trying to improve,

1:07:34.750 --> 1:07:37.390
or it could just be simply
learning about business

1:07:37.390 --> 1:07:38.870
or getting better,

1:07:38.870 --> 1:07:41.360
but not everyone that
is a reader is a leader,

1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:43.853
but I know very few leaders
that are not readers.

1:07:50.453 --> 1:07:53.203
(water bubbling)

1:07:58.945 --> 1:08:01.778
(machine beeping)

1:08:04.230 --> 1:08:05.692
- I wish I had more
energy to be more chipper,

1:08:05.692 --> 1:08:10.110
but it's going on 1:13 in the morning

1:08:10.110 --> 1:08:12.988
and I'm in Saint David's Hospital

1:08:12.988 --> 1:08:15.150
and I haven't slept in,

1:08:15.150 --> 1:08:19.770
I haven't slept pretty
much in the last two weeks.

1:08:19.770 --> 1:08:21.586
Yeah man, they can't
figure out what's wrong.

1:08:21.586 --> 1:08:24.370
My white blood cells and red blood cells

1:08:24.370 --> 1:08:27.249
are all out of whack,
which is kind of crazy.

1:08:27.249 --> 1:08:29.850
- Initially, I got texts
from Hal and it was,

1:08:29.850 --> 1:08:33.140
there were things just like,
hey, I don't feel good,

1:08:33.140 --> 1:08:34.060
I'm not sleeping,

1:08:34.060 --> 1:08:35.446
I don't know what's wrong.

1:08:35.446 --> 1:08:38.410
And then it was, I went
to the hospital yesterday

1:08:38.410 --> 1:08:42.348
and that was the first
flag of, oh, what happened?

1:08:42.348 --> 1:08:43.670
He's like, oh, well, we
drained a bunch of fluid

1:08:43.670 --> 1:08:45.091
from my lungs.

1:08:45.091 --> 1:08:46.565
Then it happened again.

1:08:46.565 --> 1:08:50.430
And by the third time he
went into the hospital

1:08:50.430 --> 1:08:51.710
to drain fluid,

1:08:51.710 --> 1:08:54.810
he was draining quarts of fluid at a time.

1:08:54.810 --> 1:08:57.030
I was kind of concerned about it.

1:08:57.030 --> 1:08:59.373
But we didn't know what it was.

1:08:59.373 --> 1:09:03.040
- After about five or six times

1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:05.780
of getting him stuck in
the back with a long needle

1:09:05.780 --> 1:09:07.934
and pulling out two liters of fluid,

1:09:07.934 --> 1:09:11.727
we finally went to a different
hospital and they said,

1:09:11.727 --> 1:09:13.740
"We don't know why the other
hospital let you go home

1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:16.537
but we're not releasing you
until we know what's wrong. "

1:09:19.390 --> 1:09:21.230
- Learning the secrets of using the mind

1:09:21.230 --> 1:09:23.830
to achieve goals in health,
wealth, and happiness.

1:09:23.830 --> 1:09:25.720
Modern medicine can do a lot to heal

1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:28.920
but the mind is also a powerful
part of that prescription.

1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:30.400
Take a look at these pictures.

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:32.060
The 20 year old man in this car

1:09:32.060 --> 1:09:37.060
was hit head on at 70 miles
an hour by a drunk driver.

1:09:37.140 --> 1:09:39.010
He was pronounced dead at the scene.

1:09:39.010 --> 1:09:39.846
So what happened?

1:09:39.846 --> 1:09:42.240
Well, please welcome Hal Elrod.

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:44.430
Did you ever go back to those
times where you thought,

1:09:44.430 --> 1:09:45.320
okay, is it worth it?

1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:46.680
Is it worth fighting?

1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:47.680
- Yes and no.

1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:49.610
I mean, the thoughts of
course went through my mind

1:09:49.610 --> 1:09:51.430
of how am I gonna do this?

1:09:51.430 --> 1:09:52.920
My body's a wreck.

1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:54.260
How am I gonna get better?

1:09:54.260 --> 1:09:55.620
But I don't think I ever gave up.

1:09:55.620 --> 1:09:58.690
I always thought the only
place to go is forward,

1:09:58.690 --> 1:10:00.210
the only place to go is up.

1:10:00.210 --> 1:10:01.460
I can't focus on the past.

1:10:01.460 --> 1:10:02.740
I've got to move past that

1:10:02.740 --> 1:10:04.760
and focus all of my energy and attention,

1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:06.820
not on complaining about what went wrong

1:10:06.820 --> 1:10:07.840
and wishing it didn't happen,

1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:09.710
but all of my energy went into

1:10:09.710 --> 1:10:12.380
my thoughts, words, and actions
that would move me forward

1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:14.250
and align with what I wanted.

1:10:14.250 --> 1:10:17.550
- I found out about you
from Brianna Greenspan,

1:10:17.550 --> 1:10:20.160
who is in the audience, who
you have also encouraged her

1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:21.630
and she said, "The book is amazing. "

1:10:21.630 --> 1:10:23.800
And Brianna, you went through
something in your life too

1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:26.609
where you were told probably won't walk.

1:10:26.609 --> 1:10:29.370
- When I was 12, I cracked my spine.

1:10:29.370 --> 1:10:31.645
And when I was 19, I had fusion surgery

1:10:31.645 --> 1:10:33.600
but my body rejected it

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:35.852
and I couldn't walk for a year and a half.

1:10:35.852 --> 1:10:38.230
As a kid, I was always getting sick

1:10:38.230 --> 1:10:41.200
and I had a variety of
different challenges.

1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:42.900
It was going to the foot
doctor, the eye doctor,

1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:46.070
the stomach doctor, the ear
doctor and every other doctor.

1:10:46.070 --> 1:10:49.304
When I first got my
Ehlers-Danlos diagnosis,

1:10:49.304 --> 1:10:53.569
I felt relieved and I felt understood.

1:10:53.569 --> 1:10:56.986
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a
connective tissue disorder

1:10:56.986 --> 1:11:00.310
that affects the collagen in your body.

1:11:00.310 --> 1:11:02.710
Sometimes there's dislocations,

1:11:02.710 --> 1:11:06.588
sometimes there's extreme
stomach challenges,

1:11:06.588 --> 1:11:08.730
sometimes there's inflammation.

1:11:08.730 --> 1:11:12.290
And I used to have extreme,
widespread pain everywhere.

1:11:12.290 --> 1:11:14.533
It would hurt to just take a step.

1:11:22.257 --> 1:11:24.260
"The Miracle Morning" has
helped me tremendously

1:11:24.260 --> 1:11:25.809
with my EDS diagnosis.

1:11:25.809 --> 1:11:27.665
I could immediately see

1:11:27.665 --> 1:11:30.870
that by incorporating
some version of the SAVERS

1:11:30.870 --> 1:11:32.880
into my daily routine,

1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:35.144
I'd be able to do more with my time.

1:11:35.144 --> 1:11:38.023
And that was something that
was really intriguing to me.

1:11:40.182 --> 1:11:44.250
I am fit, healthy, strong, and attractive.

1:11:44.250 --> 1:11:46.970
I am confident that I can and will handle

1:11:46.970 --> 1:11:50.100
any situation that life throws at me.

1:11:50.100 --> 1:11:52.090
I was consumed a lot of the time

1:11:52.090 --> 1:11:54.579
by the pain that I was experiencing

1:11:54.579 --> 1:11:58.572
the first 19, 20 years of my life.

1:11:58.572 --> 1:12:02.569
And the last nine years have
been completely different

1:12:02.569 --> 1:12:06.090
because I'm able to
release some of that pain

1:12:06.090 --> 1:12:10.230
and shift the focus from how I'm feeling

1:12:10.230 --> 1:12:11.310
to how I want to feel

1:12:11.310 --> 1:12:14.533
and what I'm gonna do to feel differently.

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.863
I am grateful for my health.

1:12:29.890 --> 1:12:32.903
I feel relaxed, open and balanced.

1:12:53.450 --> 1:12:56.454
All of this art was actually
created by Paul Joy,

1:12:56.454 --> 1:13:00.410
who had been doing "The Miracle
Morning" for about a year

1:13:00.410 --> 1:13:02.156
and he posted something in the group

1:13:02.156 --> 1:13:05.337
and I saw them and immediately
reached out and said,

1:13:05.337 --> 1:13:07.330
"Hey, I want to create something

1:13:07.330 --> 1:13:09.516
that can help people
elevate their environment

1:13:09.516 --> 1:13:11.516
and shift their subconscious thinking. "

1:13:11.516 --> 1:13:14.701
And he immediately was on
board, was super excited.

1:13:14.701 --> 1:13:18.670
I told Hal what I was doing
and he immediately loved it

1:13:18.670 --> 1:13:20.804
and the rest is history.

1:13:20.804 --> 1:13:24.653
I feel normal for the first time.

1:13:25.597 --> 1:13:28.720
That's exactly what I was hoping to do,

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:29.980
to make a whole bunch of people

1:13:29.980 --> 1:13:32.400
that have felt misdiagnosed, misunderstood

1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:37.400
and like they were a total weirdo

1:13:38.070 --> 1:13:39.620
feel normal for the first time.

1:14:12.567 --> 1:14:15.400
(whimsical music)

1:14:18.620 --> 1:14:19.840
- There's quite a bit of science

1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:24.207
behind the application of
journaling and the benefits of it.

1:14:24.207 --> 1:14:25.550
The most compelling evidence

1:14:25.550 --> 1:14:28.000
is actually in the field
of gratitude journaling.

1:14:37.873 --> 1:14:40.920
When you write down
what you're grateful for

1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:43.600
and you emailed that experience,

1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:45.660
we found within six to eight weeks

1:14:45.660 --> 1:14:48.940
they score higher on happiness baselines.

1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:50.130
They also score higher

1:14:50.130 --> 1:14:53.240
in terms of being able
to help other people,

1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:55.040
something called prosocial behavior.

1:14:58.420 --> 1:15:01.020
- So I'm really big on describing.

1:15:01.020 --> 1:15:02.740
That's something that
I'm a big believer in.

1:15:02.740 --> 1:15:05.780
If I can see it on paper,
then to me, it becomes real.

1:15:05.780 --> 1:15:08.770
And what becomes reality
becomes part of my life.

1:15:08.770 --> 1:15:10.310
So when I sit down every single day

1:15:10.310 --> 1:15:11.430
with "The Five Minute Journal"

1:15:11.430 --> 1:15:13.440
or another journal of any kind,

1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:16.120
and I actually write things
down, it just becomes real,

1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:18.570
those words on a page
become my actual life.

1:15:18.570 --> 1:15:21.010
- You create the day
before the day starts.

1:15:21.010 --> 1:15:22.694
People talk about law of attraction,

1:15:22.694 --> 1:15:24.220
but what I'm talking about

1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:27.660
is a very real consistent daily creation

1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:29.500
where you're doing it every day.

1:15:29.500 --> 1:15:30.910
At night, you open up your journal,

1:15:30.910 --> 1:15:33.473
you look at what are the things
you did and didn't do it.

1:15:33.473 --> 1:15:36.238
It helps keep you accountable
to the actual actions

1:15:36.238 --> 1:15:39.670
that you're taking to
move forward in life.

1:15:39.670 --> 1:15:42.930
- It forces you to sit down and identify

1:15:42.930 --> 1:15:44.420
what's the most important task

1:15:44.420 --> 1:15:46.150
or result you want to achieve today.

1:15:46.150 --> 1:15:48.570
It makes you consciously plan your day

1:15:48.570 --> 1:15:50.680
as opposed to again, like most people,

1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:53.630
you wake up and you start
reacting to the demand of others.

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:12.121
- When I came in here, I
was having kidney failure,

1:16:12.121 --> 1:16:13.996
my lungs were full of fluid

1:16:13.996 --> 1:16:17.040
and my heart was surrounded by fluid

1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:18.630
in a dangerous way

1:16:18.630 --> 1:16:21.658
to where it could cause heart
failure, kidney failure.

1:16:21.658 --> 1:16:23.830
I've got a catheter in my heart

1:16:23.830 --> 1:16:25.810
that is draining the
fluid out from my heart.

1:16:25.810 --> 1:16:26.670
It's mostly drained.

1:16:26.670 --> 1:16:28.177
It's going well.

1:16:28.177 --> 1:16:29.010
I've got a catheter in my lung

1:16:29.010 --> 1:16:31.130
that is draining the fluid from my lung.

1:16:31.130 --> 1:16:31.963
Hooked up to electrodes

1:16:31.963 --> 1:16:33.560
to make sure I don't have a heart attack.

1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:37.743
I've been diagnosed with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

1:16:40.438 --> 1:16:43.105
(gentle music)

1:16:49.850 --> 1:16:51.377
- I remember having

1:16:51.377 --> 1:16:54.610
these kind of jarring emotional responses

1:16:54.610 --> 1:16:56.810
to, oh my God, he's not doing well.

1:16:56.810 --> 1:16:59.310
And there's a chance that
he's actually gonna die.

1:17:04.013 --> 1:17:09.013
That for me, it's a very
trying emotional experience

1:17:12.770 --> 1:17:14.423
in ways that you don't expect.

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:18.620
- You idolize someone and you see them

1:17:18.620 --> 1:17:23.493
as the strongest, healthiest
like person you've ever known

1:17:26.230 --> 1:17:29.870
and then something gets thrown at them

1:17:29.870 --> 1:17:34.039
that makes you remember they're human

1:17:34.039 --> 1:17:38.430
and that's, it's a wake up call.

1:17:38.430 --> 1:17:42.180
- So I remember I was driving
from Philadelphia to Austin

1:17:42.180 --> 1:17:44.900
to move within miles of Hal,

1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:47.410
super excited to be near my buddy.

1:17:47.410 --> 1:17:51.981
I remember I was in my hotel
room and he told me the news

1:17:51.981 --> 1:17:56.093
and I didn't know how to respond.

1:17:56.941 --> 1:17:59.840
(crying)

1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:03.003
- And I was gonna go see Hal
in the hospital that day.

1:18:05.657 --> 1:18:08.340
And I remember totally breaking down

1:18:08.340 --> 1:18:09.480
in front of these parents,

1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:11.619
100% complete breakdown.

1:18:11.619 --> 1:18:13.560
And that was actually the first time

1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:18.560
that I was articulating how
important this person was

1:18:20.152 --> 1:18:22.985
and how serious the situation was.

1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:26.820
- Hey, this is a message for
the Miracle Morning community.

1:18:26.820 --> 1:18:30.330
If you're willing to send some
positive thoughts Hal's way,

1:18:30.330 --> 1:18:32.130
maybe leave a positive message

1:18:32.130 --> 1:18:34.030
for Hal under this video,

1:18:34.030 --> 1:18:35.430
you can acknowledge or thank him

1:18:35.430 --> 1:18:36.920
for any difference he's made in your life,

1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:40.000
just give him something
fun and uplifting to read

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.683
while he's resting and recovering.

1:18:44.330 --> 1:18:45.922
- Hal, Robert Kiyosaki,

1:18:45.922 --> 1:18:47.860
I heard through the grapevine

1:18:47.860 --> 1:18:51.440
that you may have recurrent
cancer or something.

1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:53.283
I just want to call to wish you the best

1:18:53.283 --> 1:18:56.430
and thank you for your
contribution to the world

1:18:56.430 --> 1:18:58.090
with your book "Miracle Morning"

1:18:58.090 --> 1:19:01.394
and to my life personally.

1:19:01.394 --> 1:19:03.370
- Hal, my good friend,

1:19:03.370 --> 1:19:05.080
I'm sending you some love,

1:19:05.080 --> 1:19:06.760
sending you some healing vibes, my man.

1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:11.110
When the world is chasing
money and chasing success,

1:19:11.110 --> 1:19:12.310
you're chasing love.

1:19:12.310 --> 1:19:14.180
And for me, that is priceless.

1:19:14.180 --> 1:19:16.900
- Your impact and your spirit

1:19:16.900 --> 1:19:18.180
and your energy in the world

1:19:18.180 --> 1:19:20.179
has made such a difference
in so many people's lives.

1:19:20.179 --> 1:19:21.550
We're all proud of you.

1:19:21.550 --> 1:19:22.480
We're all cheering for you.

1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:24.090
We're all praying for you.

1:19:24.090 --> 1:19:25.270
And we all love you.

1:19:25.270 --> 1:19:26.310
- I just wanted to remind you

1:19:26.310 --> 1:19:28.007
how much you've helped me

1:19:28.007 --> 1:19:30.183
and so many other people
all around the world

1:19:30.183 --> 1:19:33.180
because of your amazing
strength and resilience,

1:19:33.180 --> 1:19:34.470
and you can get through anything.

1:19:34.470 --> 1:19:36.790
So thank you for being
the champion you are.

1:19:36.790 --> 1:19:39.070
- You know, I just sent a
couple of prayers over to you

1:19:39.070 --> 1:19:41.320
but never just told you
straight up that I just

1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:44.100
am wishing for a speedy recovery.

1:19:44.100 --> 1:19:44.933
- I love you.

1:19:44.933 --> 1:19:45.766
You're amazing.

1:19:45.766 --> 1:19:46.630
You're a great father.

1:19:46.630 --> 1:19:49.430
You're a great human and
you're a great husband.

1:19:49.430 --> 1:19:51.530
- They did tell me it looks
like I'll be losing my hair

1:19:51.530 --> 1:19:52.720
in a few weeks.

1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:54.800
So I spiked it.

1:19:54.800 --> 1:19:55.840
I thought all right,

1:19:55.840 --> 1:19:58.640
this might be my last
chance to spike my hair.

1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:01.120
So I did it up today.

1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:02.130
I'm feeling good.

1:20:26.220 --> 1:20:27.350
Tammy, thank you so much.

1:20:27.350 --> 1:20:28.530
Have a great day.

1:20:28.530 --> 1:20:29.683
I will see you soon.

1:20:32.150 --> 1:20:36.510
So for me, while I'm
focused on being optimistic

1:20:36.510 --> 1:20:39.319
and all of that most of the time,

1:20:39.319 --> 1:20:42.370
there are times where the realism sets in

1:20:42.370 --> 1:20:45.393
and I realize that I could die,

1:20:46.264 --> 1:20:48.659
I very much, very well,
despite all the positivity,

1:20:48.659 --> 1:20:50.203
I could die.

1:20:52.750 --> 1:20:55.583
With a wife and two babies,

1:21:00.540 --> 1:21:02.573
leaving them is terrifying.

1:21:04.680 --> 1:21:05.803
My son needs me.

1:21:06.880 --> 1:21:10.127
My daughter needs me and my wife needs me

1:21:10.127 --> 1:21:12.623
and the world needs me
and I need me, right?

1:21:15.345 --> 1:21:18.380
So, those moments, those dark moments,

1:21:18.380 --> 1:21:20.650
those fearful moments,

1:21:20.650 --> 1:21:25.610
I really try to minimize
and not to deny them,

1:21:25.610 --> 1:21:29.240
I feel them, as you can
see, I really, I feel them,

1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:32.610
but I don't dwell there.

1:21:32.610 --> 1:21:33.610
Right, and I really believe,

1:21:33.610 --> 1:21:37.200
that you want to look at
the worst case scenario

1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:40.680
and you want to acknowledge
it and then accept it

1:21:40.680 --> 1:21:42.437
and then be at peace with it

1:21:42.437 --> 1:21:47.043
so that it doesn't cause,
it doesn't hold you back.

1:21:47.043 --> 1:21:49.160
And it's the same thing when
I was in the car accident.

1:21:49.160 --> 1:21:50.720
Dead for six minutes, broke 11 bones,

1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:51.890
told I'd never walk again,

1:21:51.890 --> 1:21:53.900
it's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1:21:53.900 --> 1:21:55.240
And so now I feel,

1:21:55.240 --> 1:21:56.959
even though I'm in the
midst of the cancer,

1:21:56.959 --> 1:21:58.590
they say hindsight's 20/20.

1:21:58.590 --> 1:22:00.010
Why wait till the future

1:22:00.010 --> 1:22:01.703
to see the positivity, the power,

1:22:01.703 --> 1:22:04.500
in every experience we face, good or bad.

1:22:04.500 --> 1:22:06.798
Every experience we face is an asset

1:22:06.798 --> 1:22:09.060
if we choose to see it that way.

1:22:09.060 --> 1:22:10.040
Just as the accident

1:22:10.040 --> 1:22:11.380
was the best thing that
ever happened to me,

1:22:11.380 --> 1:22:12.819
I really believe,

1:22:12.819 --> 1:22:13.652
because it allowed me to find,

1:22:13.652 --> 1:22:15.680
to share it with other
people and help them,

1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:16.781
the cancer is gonna be

1:22:16.781 --> 1:22:19.800
the new best thing that
ever happened to me.

1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:20.700
And then I'm gonna find a way

1:22:20.700 --> 1:22:23.697
to keep helping others
through the experience

1:22:23.697 --> 1:22:26.153
and the things that I'm
learning and overcoming.

1:22:34.941 --> 1:22:37.774
(whimsical music)

1:22:45.043 --> 1:22:49.123
♪ It's time to slow down ♪

1:22:49.123 --> 1:22:54.123
♪ And give myself a
little love right now ♪

1:22:54.196 --> 1:22:56.997
- We have a video message
that we're gonna play.

1:22:56.997 --> 1:23:01.043
And this was prerecorded
just in the last day or two

1:23:01.043 --> 1:23:03.380
by our good friend, Hal Elrod.

1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:04.610
And I'll share with all of you right now,

1:23:04.610 --> 1:23:06.050
we've been throughout the day,

1:23:06.050 --> 1:23:07.070
seeing if there was a time

1:23:07.070 --> 1:23:09.405
where he wanted to address us live

1:23:09.405 --> 1:23:12.610
and he's having a rough
day right now, right?

1:23:12.610 --> 1:23:15.160
I'm just gonna call it as it
is, he's having a rough day.

1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:17.893
So if you guys want to cue
it up, that'd be awesome.

1:23:19.340 --> 1:23:23.120
- I'm coming to you
today from the hospital.

1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:26.170
Just in case you thought this
was what my office looks like,

1:23:26.170 --> 1:23:29.650
nope, I am in the hospital
undergoing treatment right now.

1:23:29.650 --> 1:23:30.540
Doctor's orders,

1:23:30.540 --> 1:23:34.520
which is why, sadly, I
am not there with you.

1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:35.840
However, the lesson,

1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:38.480
and really it's to me, the question

1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:40.620
that I believe we need
to be asking ourselves

1:23:40.620 --> 1:23:43.860
is how are we impacting the world,

1:23:43.860 --> 1:23:45.910
and not just our bank account?

1:23:45.910 --> 1:23:48.760
The biggest impact we can make
is how we treat other people,

1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:51.920
how we show up, how we
show up to our work.

1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:53.304
You've heard me say this before,

1:23:53.304 --> 1:23:56.210
I think the greatest gift we
can give to people around us

1:23:56.210 --> 1:23:58.530
is to live to our full potential

1:23:58.530 --> 1:24:01.890
so that we give them permission
and confidence and courage

1:24:01.890 --> 1:24:03.790
to live to their full potential.

1:24:03.790 --> 1:24:04.930
So how are you showing up?

1:24:04.930 --> 1:24:05.890
Right, that's the question?

1:24:05.890 --> 1:24:07.050
How are we showing up?

1:24:07.050 --> 1:24:08.500
- I think one of the ways

1:24:08.500 --> 1:24:10.290
we can measure the quality of our lives

1:24:10.290 --> 1:24:12.427
is by how we show up for people.

1:24:12.427 --> 1:24:14.005
Hal has done this for years.

1:24:14.005 --> 1:24:17.220
He's shown up in huge
ways for so many people.

1:24:17.220 --> 1:24:20.540
We need to not only work
to take care of ourselves,

1:24:20.540 --> 1:24:24.370
to become the best version
of ourselves, for others.

1:24:24.370 --> 1:24:29.370
But we do that knowing that one
day when we face a challenge

1:24:29.710 --> 1:24:33.330
it's important to have
relationship equity,

1:24:33.330 --> 1:24:36.320
that we have poured so much into others,

1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:38.120
that when we're in a time of need,

1:24:38.120 --> 1:24:39.860
that people will show up for us.

1:24:39.860 --> 1:24:43.510
And Hal has so many
people that have shown up

1:24:43.510 --> 1:24:46.550
because of how he has shown
up for them for so many years.

1:24:46.550 --> 1:24:49.000
- Love you, take care,
guys, I'll talk to you soon.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:50.790
- Hey, if you want to
turn and acknowledge Hal,

1:24:50.790 --> 1:24:53.230
he can see you in that
camera right back there.

1:24:53.230 --> 1:24:55.270
Give Hal a big round of applause.

1:24:55.270 --> 1:24:56.712
We love you, buddy.

1:24:56.712 --> 1:24:58.133
Why Hal?

1:24:58.133 --> 1:24:59.630
That just doesn't seem right.

1:24:59.630 --> 1:25:01.510
He's offering so much to the world.

1:25:01.510 --> 1:25:04.291
Why would he be faced with this challenge?

1:25:04.291 --> 1:25:06.190
But you know in life, you don't get to say

1:25:06.190 --> 1:25:07.640
what's fair and not fair.

1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:09.730
That's not what life gives you.

1:25:09.730 --> 1:25:11.020
Life gives you things

1:25:11.020 --> 1:25:14.210
and you choose to turn
those things that happen

1:25:14.210 --> 1:25:19.210
into gold or silver or
opportunity or lessons,

1:25:19.229 --> 1:25:21.640
or you choose something different.

1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:25.390
And Hal is choosing to turn this challenge

1:25:25.390 --> 1:25:28.350
into an opportunity for all of us to grow.

1:25:28.350 --> 1:25:30.320
And I think the way we honor Hal

1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:35.290
is by choosing to grow with
him through this experience

1:25:35.290 --> 1:25:39.192
and celebrate his health when
he gets to the other side.

1:25:39.192 --> 1:25:42.025
(inspiring music)

1:26:05.776 --> 1:26:07.610
- Some fresh juice for the day.

1:26:07.610 --> 1:26:10.463
- One person can only
drink so much liquid.

1:26:12.430 --> 1:26:16.050
- I just decided that I
was gonna be there for him.

1:26:16.050 --> 1:26:18.310
And I made a flight like at 10 a. m.

1:26:18.310 --> 1:26:19.720
and left the house at four

1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:21.270
and I haven't been back since.

1:26:21.270 --> 1:26:25.010
And at a certain point,
he said I should go home.

1:26:25.010 --> 1:26:28.290
It kind of got quiet
and I thought about it.

1:26:28.290 --> 1:26:30.487
And the next day I told him, I said,

1:26:30.487 --> 1:26:33.430
"You know Hal, I can't leave you. "

1:26:33.430 --> 1:26:37.940
And he said, which I
thought was interesting,

1:26:37.940 --> 1:26:40.010
he said, "I'm so glad you said that

1:26:40.010 --> 1:26:43.080
because I don't want you to go".

1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:45.550
- This is living in three places,

1:26:45.550 --> 1:26:49.093
living between an apartment
here in Houston with my dad,

1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:53.790
and living in the hospital

1:26:53.790 --> 1:26:57.120
and then living at home
with my family and my home.

1:26:57.120 --> 1:26:59.050
So between treatments,

1:26:59.050 --> 1:27:02.350
I'm focusing on building up my immunity.

1:27:02.350 --> 1:27:06.710
So there's wellness formula,
there's garlic immune.

1:27:06.710 --> 1:27:07.870
This is my parlor trick

1:27:07.870 --> 1:27:11.550
that I've been doing since I was a teen

1:27:11.550 --> 1:27:12.800
is to drink all of these.

1:27:14.412 --> 1:27:17.245
(inspiring music)

1:27:22.550 --> 1:27:25.340
And I just got a Miracle Morning cup

1:27:25.340 --> 1:27:27.430
that way everyone knows this is my cup.

1:27:27.430 --> 1:27:28.860
There's no question whose cup this is.

1:27:28.860 --> 1:27:30.936
It's the only Miracle
Morning cup in the house.

1:27:30.936 --> 1:27:33.019

- 10 seconds to go.

1:28:26.300 --> 1:28:30.060
- 10 seconds, how's my
plank, how's my posture?

1:28:30.060 --> 1:28:32.060
- Four, three, two, one.

1:28:37.063 --> 1:28:40.540
(breathing deeply)

1:28:40.540 --> 1:28:43.707
- My 2017 healing cancer affirmations.

1:28:45.304 --> 1:28:47.360
I will do whatever it takes

1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:49.710
putting forth extraordinary
effort to beat cancer

1:28:49.710 --> 1:28:53.160
and live a long, healthy
life for my family.

1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:54.440
I will beat cancer for Ursula

1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:57.100
because I committed to
her forever in a day

1:28:57.100 --> 1:28:59.601
and I want to grow old and
spend the rest of our long,

1:28:59.601 --> 1:29:01.934
(sniffling)

1:29:04.749 --> 1:29:07.153
spend the rest of our lives together.

1:29:09.800 --> 1:29:13.647
I'll beat cancer for Sophie
because she needs her daddy.

1:29:19.820 --> 1:29:21.110
I'll beat cancer for Helston

1:29:21.110 --> 1:29:23.610
because he needs my love,
leadership and guidance.

1:29:24.983 --> 1:29:27.066
(crying)

1:29:32.197 --> 1:29:35.770
I don't normally read these out loud.

1:29:35.770 --> 1:29:36.820
I read 'em to myself.

1:29:37.791 --> 1:29:40.870
I'll beat cancer for dad
because he gave up everything

1:29:42.033 --> 1:29:44.733
to heal me and save my life.

1:29:46.070 --> 1:29:47.090
I'll beat cancer for mom

1:29:47.090 --> 1:29:52.090
because she doesn't deserve
to lose another child.

1:29:52.490 --> 1:29:54.170
I'll beat cancer for me

1:29:54.170 --> 1:29:59.170
because I want and deserve
to live a long life.

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:03.030
And I'll beat cancer for
the millions of people

1:30:04.210 --> 1:30:06.560
who are themselves battling cancer

1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:08.750
or some other disease

1:30:08.750 --> 1:30:12.090
and don't have the knowledge
or resources that I do

1:30:12.090 --> 1:30:14.563
and desperately need my
leadership and support.

1:30:15.490 --> 1:30:17.203
All right, those are my affirmations.

1:30:20.060 --> 1:30:22.070
Time to visualize.

1:30:22.070 --> 1:30:24.010
- It's hard and it's scary

1:30:24.010 --> 1:30:29.010
and I try to be strong
for him, for the kids,

1:30:29.330 --> 1:30:31.080
I don't want the kids to be scared.

1:30:32.540 --> 1:30:34.340
I only tell them the positive things

1:30:35.690 --> 1:30:38.313
and if they bring up the scary things,

1:30:40.378 --> 1:30:41.660
I answer it in a way seven
year old will understand

1:30:41.660 --> 1:30:44.090
or a four year old will understand.

1:30:44.090 --> 1:30:46.590
- So how often do you guys
see your dad right now?

1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:49.870
- Barely.
- Barely.

1:30:49.870 --> 1:30:51.585
- Mia, you don't see him much?

1:30:51.585 --> 1:30:52.418
- Uh uh.

1:30:52.418 --> 1:30:53.251
- Well, why not?

1:30:55.351 --> 1:30:57.002
- He's in Houston.

1:30:57.002 --> 1:30:57.835
- What is he doing in Houston?

1:30:59.810 --> 1:31:00.643
- Chemo.

1:31:01.910 --> 1:31:04.290
- Can you explain to me what that is?

1:31:04.290 --> 1:31:05.840
- It's like a type of medicine

1:31:05.840 --> 1:31:07.640
because he has leukemia cancer.

1:31:07.640 --> 1:31:10.190
- He has so much medicines.

1:31:10.190 --> 1:31:12.690
- How does that make you feel?

1:31:15.790 --> 1:31:16.623
- Sad.

1:31:18.230 --> 1:31:19.063
- Yeah?

1:31:19.063 --> 1:31:19.896
- Yeah sad, too.

1:31:21.086 --> 1:31:23.490
- Well, what are you guys excited about

1:31:23.490 --> 1:31:25.537
when he's all healed up

1:31:25.537 --> 1:31:27.030
and he doesn't need any more medicine,

1:31:27.030 --> 1:31:28.860
what are you excited about doing with him?

1:31:28.860 --> 1:31:31.564
- We can go hug him.

1:31:31.564 --> 1:31:33.326
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:31:33.326 --> 1:31:35.576
- Bye, love you, goodnight.

1:31:46.375 --> 1:31:48.958
(gentle music)

1:31:57.761 --> 1:32:01.361
- And so the last 10 days
have been the hardest

1:32:01.361 --> 1:32:02.944
10 days of my life.

1:32:04.663 --> 1:32:06.401
Pain management for the last 11 days,

1:32:06.401 --> 1:32:08.170
which I didn't really even
know what that concept meant,

1:32:08.170 --> 1:32:09.867
but it's essentially,

1:32:09.867 --> 1:32:14.867
you know, just you are living
each day to minimize your pain

1:32:15.070 --> 1:32:17.140
or I think that's what it
is, what it was for me,

1:32:17.140 --> 1:32:18.403
just minimize your pain.

1:32:22.115 --> 1:32:25.440
And none of this changes,

1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:28.503
how hard this has been doesn't
change my overall outlook,

1:32:29.441 --> 1:32:31.380
which is I'm grateful for all of this,

1:32:31.380 --> 1:32:34.630
because I truly believe
that what doesn't heal you

1:32:34.630 --> 1:32:36.420
makes you stronger.

1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:39.230
And those are the greatest
opportunities we have,

1:32:39.230 --> 1:32:40.063
that adversity,

1:32:40.063 --> 1:32:41.047
and the more difficult it is,

1:32:41.047 --> 1:32:45.200
the better the opportunity for
us to learn, for us to grow,

1:32:45.200 --> 1:32:46.900
become better than we've ever been before,

1:32:46.900 --> 1:32:49.040
and then go out and make a difference

1:32:49.040 --> 1:32:51.800
with what we've learned
and who we've become.

1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:53.110
- Yeah that's, I think one of the things

1:32:53.110 --> 1:32:54.470
that draws people into Hal

1:32:54.470 --> 1:32:57.300
and why so many people
from around the world

1:32:57.300 --> 1:32:58.200
love and respect him

1:32:58.200 --> 1:33:02.260
is he's walking the talk
even when the chips are down.

1:33:02.260 --> 1:33:05.040
- You know, it's easy
to be happy and positive

1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:06.550
when everything's going great.

1:33:06.550 --> 1:33:07.383
And it would be easy

1:33:07.383 --> 1:33:09.521
for somebody on the outside to
look into Hal's life and say

1:33:09.521 --> 1:33:12.610
you know, bestselling book and
all these things are amazing,

1:33:12.610 --> 1:33:15.350
of course, it's easy to be that positive,

1:33:15.350 --> 1:33:16.756
but I've watched Hal

1:33:16.756 --> 1:33:21.270
go through some of the most
challenging moments of life.

1:33:21.270 --> 1:33:23.200
- I believe that there
are people on this Earth

1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:26.240
that are the Hal Elrod's of the world.

1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:30.100
They get put on this
earth to endure things

1:33:30.100 --> 1:33:33.660
that the average person couldn't

1:33:33.660 --> 1:33:36.523
to remind us that the average person can.

1:33:37.465 --> 1:33:40.115
- This is the Elrod family

1:33:40.115 --> 1:33:44.323
for "The Miracle Morning Movie" take one.

1:33:45.690 --> 1:33:47.093
Soft sticks marker.

1:33:49.059 --> 1:33:50.380
Nice.

1:33:50.380 --> 1:33:52.660
The Miracle Morning
began as a daily ritual

1:33:52.660 --> 1:33:55.240
to get everything that
you want out of life,

1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:59.210
success, health, happiness,
money, love, et cetera.

1:33:59.210 --> 1:34:02.864
And I guess it's the cancer
that really taught me

1:34:02.864 --> 1:34:07.860
that what it's really
about is what matters most

1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:09.350
and what we've already had,

1:34:09.350 --> 1:34:10.410
all of us already have,

1:34:10.410 --> 1:34:14.204
which is relationships and
the people that you love.

1:34:14.204 --> 1:34:17.210
And I found out personally

1:34:17.210 --> 1:34:19.440
that I was addicted to
success and achievement

1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:20.300
and "The Miracle Morning"

1:34:20.300 --> 1:34:21.930
helped me get everything that I wanted.

1:34:21.930 --> 1:34:23.390
And then when I got
everything that I wanted

1:34:23.390 --> 1:34:26.500
I realized that although I
said family was number one

1:34:26.500 --> 1:34:28.480
and most important,

1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:29.880
my schedule didn't reflect that,

1:34:29.880 --> 1:34:30.880
my calendar didn't reflect that.

1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:32.318
I was a workaholic.

1:34:32.318 --> 1:34:35.550
And I find that too many
of us are doing that.

1:34:35.550 --> 1:34:37.310
We're squeezing in time,

1:34:37.310 --> 1:34:40.060
an hour here, a minute
there, 10 minutes there.

1:34:40.060 --> 1:34:42.150
I would set the timer
to play with my children

1:34:42.150 --> 1:34:44.730
and not give them the
time that they deserved.

1:34:44.730 --> 1:34:47.030
And I was lying to myself

1:34:47.030 --> 1:34:49.280
thinking that I was doing it all for them.

1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:51.240
I was thinking that my
role was a provider.

1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:53.290
And I realized that I wasn't,

1:34:53.290 --> 1:34:56.210
a provider wasn't my most important role.

1:34:56.210 --> 1:34:59.190
It was a father and a husband

1:34:59.190 --> 1:35:01.540
and providing was something that I did,

1:35:01.540 --> 1:35:02.740
but my kids weren't gonna remember

1:35:02.740 --> 1:35:04.140
how many mortgage payments I made,

1:35:04.140 --> 1:35:05.340
my kids weren't gonna remember

1:35:05.340 --> 1:35:09.500
how many hours I worked
and churned and burned

1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:13.520
and hustled and grinded
and whatever term you use

1:35:13.520 --> 1:35:15.961
as a badge of entrepreneurial honor.

1:35:15.961 --> 1:35:19.020
Really what mattered is
the people that I love

1:35:19.020 --> 1:35:21.500
and spending time with them.

1:35:21.500 --> 1:35:23.520
And the Miracle Morning now for me,

1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:24.500
I still do it every day,

1:35:24.500 --> 1:35:27.570
I've done it almost every
single day for gosh,

1:35:27.570 --> 1:35:28.403
eight or nine years.

1:35:28.403 --> 1:35:29.633
You want to sun gaze?

1:35:30.700 --> 1:35:32.053
Want to do a little sun gazing?

1:35:40.350 --> 1:35:41.510
I always wonder if my neighbors

1:35:41.510 --> 1:35:44.533
are looking out their windows
watching me in the morning.

1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:49.233
What it's about though

1:35:49.233 --> 1:35:53.340
is giving to myself first every single day

1:35:53.340 --> 1:35:56.450
so that I can become the
person that I need to be

1:35:56.450 --> 1:35:58.220
to be the best dad

1:35:58.220 --> 1:36:00.800
and be the best husband
and be the best CEO

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:03.940
and be the best friend and leader and son.

1:36:03.940 --> 1:36:05.570
And that's what the
Miracle Morning is about.

1:36:05.570 --> 1:36:09.000
It's about becoming your
best every single day

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.400
so that you can show up and give your best

1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:13.100
to the people that matter most to you

1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:15.678
in your world and in your life.

1:36:15.678 --> 1:36:18.511
(inspiring music)

1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:23.830
- We're going to ring the bell.

1:36:25.968 --> 1:36:27.359
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

1:36:27.359 --> 1:36:28.399
- Ding, ding, ding, ding.

1:36:28.399 --> 1:36:29.574
- Okay.

1:36:29.574 --> 1:36:32.157
(bell dinging)

1:36:33.292 --> 1:36:34.296
- Congratulations.

1:36:34.296 --> 1:36:35.547
- All right.

1:36:35.547 --> 1:36:38.190
- Everyone that has been a part of this

1:36:38.190 --> 1:36:39.150
and part of the journey,

1:36:39.150 --> 1:36:40.400
if you're watching this, I love you.

1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:41.300
Thank you so much.

1:36:43.524 --> 1:36:46.357
(inspiring music)

1:36:58.750 --> 1:37:00.780
This is about all of humanity

1:37:00.780 --> 1:37:04.010
and elevating the
consciousness of our humanity

1:37:04.010 --> 1:37:06.100
so that changing the world

1:37:06.100 --> 1:37:09.320
is something that we do
collectively together,

1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:11.140
that we don't depend on our government,

1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:14.440
that we don't depend
on some outside forces,

1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:17.260
but that we actually
all take responsibility

1:37:17.260 --> 1:37:18.850
to wake up every day,

1:37:18.850 --> 1:37:20.960
become the best version of ourselves

1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:22.480
and then go out into the world

1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:24.150
as the best version of ourselves

1:37:24.150 --> 1:37:27.240
and positively impact
every other human being

1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:28.750
that we come into contact with.

1:37:28.750 --> 1:37:30.560
And if every single one of us does that,

1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:33.180
consciousness of humanity is elevated

1:37:33.180 --> 1:37:35.193
and the world is a better place.

1:37:35.193 --> 1:37:38.026
(inspiring music)

1:37:51.510 --> 1:37:55.960
- We got amazing news that not
only is Hal still remission,

1:37:55.960 --> 1:38:00.200
but his tests from his most
recent bone marrow aspiration

1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:01.033
came back-

1:38:01.033 --> 1:38:02.330
- Negative residual disease

1:38:02.330 --> 1:38:03.830
which means there's zero percent.

1:38:03.830 --> 1:38:05.050
- Big fat zero.

1:38:05.050 --> 1:38:06.613
So Hal's success,

1:38:06.613 --> 1:38:08.900
probability of success
in staying in remission

1:38:08.900 --> 1:38:10.710
is almost guaranteed.
- 95%.

1:38:10.710 --> 1:38:13.880
- So we are just on cloud
and we love you all.

1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:15.871
Thank you so much for supporting us.

1:38:15.871 --> 1:38:17.034
- We can never thank you enough

1:38:17.034 --> 1:38:18.954
for your extraordinary love and support.

1:38:18.954 --> 1:38:20.076
- We're just so happy.

1:38:20.076 --> 1:38:20.909
- Love you.

1:38:20.909 --> 1:38:21.800
- Love you guys.

1:38:26.330 --> 1:38:28.310
- Yeah, he's filming the movie right now.

1:38:28.310 --> 1:38:30.530
The movie is all gonna
be about us talking about

1:38:30.530 --> 1:38:32.430
that he's filming the movie right now.

1:38:33.711 --> 1:38:37.020
- Where's the makeup room, where?

1:38:37.020 --> 1:38:37.853
- There.
