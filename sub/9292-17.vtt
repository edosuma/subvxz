00:14.440 --> 00:18.911
CTU is being absorbed
by the Department of Homeland Security

00:19.000 --> 00:22.595
and Christopher Henderson
remains an open protocol.

00:22.680 --> 00:27.595
Ms Raines signed a statement documenting
the numerous missteps made today by CTU.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.432
And by you in particular.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.954
I don't understand. Why am I staying?

00:32.040 --> 00:35.350
Because Ms Raines requested
that you keep your position.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.752
I had to keep Karen from replacing you.
That's why I signed. I didn't have a choice.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.550
- Why were those men trying to kill you?
- David had a source inside the White House.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.791
- Who's this source?
- Mrs Logan's assistant.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.316
I have proof about who's behind
everything that's happened today.

00:51.400 --> 00:55.188
Someone killed David.
And then just tried to kill me.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.350
- I have to go now.
- Give me what I need!

00:57.440 --> 00:59.874
They kidnapped my little girl.

01:00.720 --> 01:05.191
Evelyn. I promise you
we're donna get your daughter back.

01:05.280 --> 01:08.590
I already told them I wouldn't give up
any information until I have my daughter.

01:08.680 --> 01:12.753
be need Henderson alive.
Do not shoot to kill.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.150
- Did you bring what we discussed?
- I have the evidence with me.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.310
I want my daughter.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.955
She's moving.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.110
- Give me the evidence, Evelyn.
- Now.

01:27.120 --> 01:30.112
Wayne, I didn't get him.
If you've got a shot, take it.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.948
Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car.
Do you have him on satellite?

01:36.040 --> 01:39.032
- We can't lose him.
- Evelyn's been hit.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.395
It's not serious, but it has to be dressed.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.119
You got your daughter,
now tell me what I need to know.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.350
Who is behind this? Is it the vice president?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.749
The vice president has
nothing to do with this!

01:49.520 --> 01:52.080
You promised you would control this.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.072
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir.

01:55.160 --> 01:58.675
Bauer and Palmer won't be around long
enough to tell anybody else what they know.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.751
I will not let you down.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.151
See that you don't.

02:13.760 --> 02:18.754
With White House-imposed martial law
and curfew still in eject throughout the area,

02:18.840 --> 02:23.630
- all traffic is restricted to emergency vehicles.
- Wayne, turn that off.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.549
OK, Evelyn, I need you to stay focused.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.473
The recording of the call
between Logan and Henderson

02:31.560 --> 02:34.393
is in a safety deposit box. Which bank?

02:34.480 --> 02:36.311
Which bank?

02:36.400 --> 02:39.472
- City Trust and Savings in Agoura Hills.
- Where's the key?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.391
My jacket pocket.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.916
- Mom?
- It's all right, your mom's donna be fine.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.230
She's donna be fine, OK?

02:48.720 --> 02:54.033
You heard what they said. We have to get off
this road. There are patrols everywhere.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.918
There's a motel up there on the right,
turn in there.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.833
- I hanna go home.
- We're gon na get you home.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.717
We're donna get you home.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.109
Wayne, can you get us a room?
1.11 keep watch.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.830
Keep pressure on it. 1.11 be right back.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.838
- Hello?
- Have you got Henderson on satellite yet?

03:42.920 --> 03:44.956
No. Chloe didn't reposition in time.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.919
- Dammit. Are you still on a secure line?
- Yes. Why? What's going on?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.232
Evelyn didn't implicate Gardner.
She implicated President Logan.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.470
Oh, my God, Jack.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.913
Logan? Are you sure?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.312
She said he's responsible for everything,
starting with giving them the nerve gas.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.709
David Palmer found out, so they killed him.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.519
President Logan ordered
Palmer's assassination?

04:06.600 --> 04:10.354
Henderson gave the order, but Evelyn
has evidence Logan was compliant.

04:10.440 --> 04:11.839
What evidence?

04:11.920 --> 04:15.196
She recorded a call this morning
between Henderson and Logan.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.113
It's in a safety deposit box.
We're on our way to get it.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.394
Jack, the city is under martial law.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.758
I know. Upload every military checkpoint
to my PDA so we can navigate around them.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.274
- AII right, 1.11 take care of that.
- Audrey.

04:27.360 --> 04:33.356
As soon as I have the recording, we'll have
to involve your father to present the evidence.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.958
AII right. He's on his way back
from a summit in Japan.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.510
- 1.11 call him on the plane.
- Leave CTU before you do anything.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.751
- You don't think they can be trusted?
- We can't trust anyone.

04:43.840 --> 04:49.676
Logan has every federal agency, the military,
at his disposal, and he'll use them to stop us.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.719
Don't fill your father in on the particulars.
Just set up the meeting.

04:53.800 --> 04:57.679
- 1.11 call back when I have the recording.
- 1.11 upload those checkpoints.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.109
Wayne.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.839
That's the bank manager's address -
he's not far.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.990
Good. Let's get them in the room.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.998
Hey. We need to get inside now.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.834
- Come on, it's OK.
- Just try to stand up.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.388
I need you to sit right here, OK?

05:26.520 --> 05:29.318
OK. Lay down here on the bed.

05:34.800 --> 05:40.432
I'm sorry, but it's not safe to take you
to a hospital yet. Let me see. Let me see.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.674
Wayne, take Amy outside for a second.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.634
Come on, sweetie.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.439
OK. Even though the bullet went through,
I still have to clean this wound.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.229
It's donna hurt, but I promise
1.11 get you to a hospital as soon as I can.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.199
- In the meantime, Wayne will look after you.
- No, 1.11 be fine.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.590
You need to get the evidence.
I don't need help.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.148
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.270
OK.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.749
Put pressure on it.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.509
- SWeetheart you can see your mom n0W.
- Go ahead.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.917
Give me the car keys. Let's go.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.474
- I haven't picked up Bauer's trail yet.
- So he got away.

06:40.560 --> 06:45.076
And there's nothing to stop him and Wayne
from going to the media with all they know.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.197
Jack knows there's no point
going public until he has proof.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.670
He won't make accusations
until he has that evidence in his hand.

06:51.760 --> 06:56.390
This evidence, this recording
that Evelyn made of our conversation,

06:56.480 --> 06:59.313
are you any closer to finding
where she's hidden it?

06:59.400 --> 07:02.198
No, not yet,
but she was wounded and I will find her.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.193
We're monitoring hospitals.
This is containable, I promise you.

07:06.280 --> 07:09.158
Please, spare me your promises,
Mr Henderson.

07:09.240 --> 07:14.360
It's all gone wrong. None of this
should have happened. AII these killings.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.797
This whole thing was planned
to make our country safer stronger,

07:18.880 --> 07:21.713
to protect ourinterests.

07:21.800 --> 07:26.476
And it all spiralled out of control
when you decided to kill David Palmer.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.596
Mr President, what's done is done.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.719
Right now, we have to focus on stopping
Bauer before he finds that recording.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.270
No. You have to focus on it.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.317
- Haven't the analysts finished the homilies?
- They're still getting up to speed.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.675
We knew this wouldn't be seamless.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.593
Sometimes I wonder if it was even necessary.

07:51.040 --> 07:55.158
Karen, CTU'S performance today
has been considerably less than stellar.

07:55.240 --> 07:59.518
Dozens have been killed, and they couldn't
even prevent an attack on themselves.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.799
Do you believe, under the circumstances,
that we could have done any better?

08:04.880 --> 08:07.872
Ms Hayes. The president's on line one.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.793
Put him through to Buchanan's office.
1.11 work there.

08:10.880 --> 08:16.477
Have Medical notify me as soon as Bierko
has regained consciousness. Miles.

08:29.720 --> 08:34.350
- Yes, Mr President?
- Karen, do you know where Jack Bauer is?

08:34.440 --> 08:38.592
Not at the moment. He was due back 30
minutes ago to lead the Bierko interrogation.

08:38.679 --> 08:42.275
- He's gone off-grid.
- I'm not surprised.

08:42.360 --> 08:47.275
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the
immediate apprehension and arrest of Bauer.

08:47.360 --> 08:53.674
I want you to run point on this, and
I want you to make this CTU'S top priority.

08:53.760 --> 08:59.278
Yes, sir. For purposes of the warrant, 1.11 need
to know what Bauer's being charged with.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.828
His role in the assassination of David Palmer.

09:01.920 --> 09:06.630
But I understood he'd been exonerated
of that charge. You reinstated his credentials.

09:06.720 --> 09:11.396
I know, but I didn't have all the facts then.
Some new evidence has come to light.

09:11.480 --> 09:15.871
- New evidence?
- Yes. I'm looking at it right now.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.270
And I will forward it to you
at the appropriate time.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.715
- Yes, sir.
- Karen.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.075
Obviously this is a very sensitive matter.

09:25.160 --> 09:29.073
For now, I'd like you to treat
the origin of this warrant as confidential.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.799
- Understood, sir.
- Good.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.957
Put out an alert on Jack Bauer to all
federal law-enforcement agencies and NSA.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.350
1.1 I also tel I M i I italy.
They have more men on the street.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.556
I don't like this.

09:45.640 --> 09:50.156
Pulling our resources off Henderson to go
after Jack without knowing the evidence?

09:50.240 --> 09:53.198
It's a direct order from the president.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.115
If we really want to find Bauer,

09:57.200 --> 10:00.988
we need to keep watch on
anyone he might contact for help,

10:01.080 --> 10:03.275
starting with Audrey Raines.

10:11.040 --> 10:15.591
- What's this?
- Make it look like we're talking about it.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.318
OK.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.156
Can you get me a secure channel
so my calls can't be monitored?

10:21.240 --> 10:24.471
Using a VPN pathway, sure.
It takes about an hour to crack.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.233
- Why, what's going on?
- I just spoke with Jack.

10:27.320 --> 10:31.836
Gardner isn't the one who's behind this.
It's President Logan.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.478
What?

10:33.560 --> 10:36.028
Jack is getting proof. I'm leaving to help him.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.350
Take a CTU walkie.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.759
Audrey.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.559
It's a warrant for Jack's arrest.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.915
- It's starting.
- What do we do?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.150
Heading out?

10:47.240 --> 10:49.549
Yes, I'm donna try to grab some sleep.

10:49.640 --> 10:53.553
- I came to talk to you about the warrant.
- Start with why it was issued.

10:53.640 --> 10:57.519
There's new evidence implicating Jack
in David Palmer's assassination.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.195
That's ridiculous.
The assassin confessed. Check the logs.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.352
I know about the logs, Chloe.
My orders are to bring Jack in.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.716
New evidence? Have you seen it?

11:08.640 --> 11:11.438
- It's forthcoming.
- Who ordered this, Karen?

11:11.520 --> 11:14.876
I can't discuss that.
When was the last time you spoke with Jack?

11:14.960 --> 11:18.111
About an hour ago.
We haven't had contact since.

11:18.200 --> 11:23.433
I don't have to remind you that you have an
obligation to notify me if Jack contacts you.

11:23.520 --> 11:28.469
Look, I know this may seem odd
to the both of you. Frankly, it does to me.

11:28.560 --> 11:33.475
But let's remember it's in everyone's
best interests to bring Jack in peacefully.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.630
Have a good night.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.711
Thank you.

11:45.200 --> 11:49.034
- Harris.
- Audrey's on her way. What's your status?

11:49.120 --> 11:53.352
- We're placing the transponder on her car.
- Good.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.432
There won't be many cars.
Use the tracker and stay out of sight.

11:57.480 --> 12:02.156
We don't want anything to stop Audrey
from leading us to Bauer.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.595
- That's the house.
- OK.

12:22.240 --> 12:26.313
- What's the bank manager's name?
- Carl Mossman.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.712
- You got your gun?
- Yeah, but we don't need one for this, do we?

12:34.800 --> 12:37.872
He won't let us into his bank
unless he thinks he has to.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.236
- Why don't we just tell him the truth?
- Would you believe it?

12:41.320 --> 12:44.198
The only way we'll have compliance
is if he's scared.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.558
If you're uncomfortable with that,
you should stay here.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.553
They've got a magnetic alarm.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.635
b?I?t' rte i rl.

13:46.720 --> 13:51.840
.-within the hour, President Logan plans
to make a statement to the American people

13:51.920 --> 13:57.472
about the successful resolution of today's
terrorist threat. As of now, however...

13:57.560 --> 14:01.030
- Did you hear something?
- Like what?

14:02.400 --> 14:04.391
I don't know.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.110
- Carl?
- Hang on.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.348
- Carl!
- 1.11 be right back.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.913
Don't you move!

14:22.000 --> 14:23.718
Rose, call...

14:24.880 --> 14:26.313
Cover him.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.639
Put the phone down.
Put the phone down now!

14:31.720 --> 14:36.032
Bring him in here!
Just stay calm and everything will be fine.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.315
Let's go!

14:39.080 --> 14:42.072
- Oh, my God! Carl!
- Take a seat on the bed.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.630
Hey, look. Our money and jewelled's
in a floor safe in the closet.

14:45.720 --> 14:50.350
We're not interested in that.
You're donna get us into your bank.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.839
I can't do that.

14:53.920 --> 14:58.914
It's not that I won't. I can't. The alarm system
will only allow entry during business hours.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.711
Don't lie to me. Every bank has procedures
to allow access during an emergency.

15:05.440 --> 15:09.353
Hey! No, no! 1.11 take you to the bank.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.956
Slowly, get up and get dressed.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.555
- Carl!
- It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.708
I want four of your neckties.

15:27.920 --> 15:32.038
Tie her up to the chair. Ankles and wrists.
Make sure she doesn't move.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.396
AII right, go ahead.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.350
She's got clearance.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.353
Come on.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.318
Hi. I need to speak
with Secretary Heller, please.

15:52.320 --> 15:58.316
Mr Secretary, there's a call coming in for you
on an encrypted channel. It's your daughter.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.036
- Audrey, is everything OK?
- H i.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.111
Yes, I'm OK.

16:04.200 --> 16:08.159
- Dad, I need your help. Is this a secure line?
- Very secure.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.915
Is this about the arrest order for Jack?
I was just informed.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.595
I can't go into details now,
but Jack is innocent. He's being set up.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.148
Set up by whom?

16:19.120 --> 16:24.148
What the hell is going on, Audrey? You call
me this morning to tell me that Jack's alive.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.835
Now I get word he's a suspect again
in the Palmer assassination.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.390
I can't talk to you about it right now.
I need to see you in person.

16:31.480 --> 16:34.278
Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles?

16:34.360 --> 16:40.151
Dad, I would never ask you to do this
if it wasn't extremely important.

16:42.560 --> 16:46.917
- AII right, yes.
- Thank you. The closest airport is Van Nuys.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.112
We're about an hour out.
1.11 call you on final approach.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.839
- OK, thank you. 1.11 see you there.
- 111 see you.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.717
Bye.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.312
Doug!

17:04.960 --> 17:06.439
Yes, sir?

17:06.520 --> 17:11.513
We have to make a stop in LA,
and keep it off the manifest.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.477
Yes, sir.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.835
Pull over. She's stopped.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.195
The corner of Elderton and Davis.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.112
It's a gas station.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.156
- O 'Brian.
- Chloe, it's me.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.800
Hold on.

17:41.880 --> 17:46.158
I switched to my VPN. They can't monitor
the conversation. Do you have the walkie?

17:46.240 --> 17:48.708
Yeah, hang on.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.713
- AII right, what do I do with it?
- Tune to proprietary channel 17.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.872
Turn sensitivity up all the way
to pick up a pilot signal.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.951
OK, hold on.

18:01.560 --> 18:06.270
- Wow. Do you hear that?
- It's what I figured. They put a tracker on you.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.838
I found it. AII right, Chloe, I got it. Thank you.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.992
You need to disable your phone
by taking the battery out.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.629
I have to wait for a call from Jack,
and then I will.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.108
- Yes?
. s i r.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.191
It's almost time.

19:00.280 --> 19:04.512
Yes, the press conference. That's right.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.959
Mr President, if I could have a moment?

19:08.040 --> 19:12.955
- 1.11 be done with my statement shortly...
- This is potentially time-sensitive, sir.

19:13.040 --> 19:17.158
I just got an alert that a warrant
has been issued for Jack Bauer.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.794
Thank you, Aaron.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.711
Yes, sir.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.991
- What about the warrant?
- It's an executive branch warrant.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.310
I didn't issue it, so it must have been you.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.311
That's right, it came from me.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.552
As you put me in charge of overseeing CTU
and the Homeland Security transfer,

19:38.640 --> 19:41.757
don't you think you should have
discussed it with me first?

19:41.840 --> 19:47.790
I appreciate everything you've done, but last
time I checked, I was still commander in chief.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.758
Of course, Mr President, but Jack Bauer?

19:50.840 --> 19:54.958
It doesn't make any sense.
We should be treating that man like a hero.

19:55.040 --> 20:00.398
I've gone over it. Cummings confessed that
he arranged the assassination, framing Bauer.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.995
Well, clearly Cummings
was protecting Bauer.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.514
- why?
- I don't know why.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.275
The fact remains I received confirmation
from intelligence sources

20:10.360 --> 20:12.999
that Bauer was, without question, the shooter.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.957
- Which sources?
- That's enough.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.794
I'm not donna stand here
and have my orders challenged.

20:18.880 --> 20:24.796
You have concerns, Hal. We will
sort this all out once Bauer's in custody.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.189
Does that suit you?

20:27.280 --> 20:29.510
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.551
Mom?

21:12.960 --> 21:15.315
Amy?

21:15.400 --> 21:17.550
I'm coming.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.075
Sweetheart? Ow!

21:39.400 --> 21:41.277
Mom!

21:43.680 --> 21:45.671
Mom.

21:52.880 --> 21:58.159
- 911. What's your emergency?
- My mom passed out. I can't wake her up.

21:58.240 --> 22:02.472
- Calm down. Tell me, what's your name?
- Amy. My mom's name is Evelyn.

22:02.560 --> 22:06.872
- And what's your mom's last name?
- Martin. Her name's Evelyn Martin.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.599
AII right, honey, now tell me where you are.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.713
Yeah.

22:14.800 --> 22:21.319
Sir, a call is coming to the 911 operator
from a motel at 1850 Porter Valley Drive,

22:21.400 --> 22:24.437
requesting assistance for an Evelyn Martin.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.988
1.11 be there shortly.

22:40.680 --> 22:43.558
My fellow Americans, it is with great relief

22:43.640 --> 22:48.760
that I announce that the terrorist threat
our nation faced today is over.

22:48.840 --> 22:52.753
More than an hour ago,
counterterrorist agents, under my direction,

22:52.840 --> 22:55.434
thwarted the latest attack on civilians,

22:55.520 --> 22:59.593
the nature of which was kept secret
due to national security.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.389
This was done
with the public's best interest in mind.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.199
- He really did it.
- Madam?

23:07.080 --> 23:08.911
Charles.

23:09.920 --> 23:13.879
He stopped the terrorists,
the treaty was signed.

23:13.960 --> 23:18.238
He said he would ride out this crisis
and everything would be OK.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.754
And it is.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.354
I should have trusted him.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.873
Yes, madam.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.794
What's wrong, Aaron?

23:28.880 --> 23:31.075
I'm just a little battle-worn.

23:48.040 --> 23:51.715
- Why are we stopping here?
- There's too many checkpoints in the area.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.758
- We'II go the rest of the way on foot.
- How far's the bank?

23:54.840 --> 23:57.718
About a quarter of a mile that way.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.591
1.11 be right back.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.478
- Aaron, it's Jack.
- Jack.

24:10.560 --> 24:15.315
Are you aware Logan's issued a warrant
for your arrest for Palmer's assassination?

24:15.400 --> 24:19.632
- No, but that makes sense.
- The vice president's not behind this, is he?

24:19.720 --> 24:22.314
No, it's Logan.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.871
They'll have every agency looking for you.
Logan is the only one who can call them off.

24:26.960 --> 24:31.795
As soon as we have the evidence, we'll pass it
off to Secretary Heller. Then it won't matter.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.668
- Is there anything I can do?
- Keep your eyes open and watch your back.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.753
Get out of the car. Come on.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.790
Let's go.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.552
Move, move.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.831
Take cover. Go!

25:06.920 --> 25:09.798
Not a word.

25:17.640 --> 25:22.509
Ms Hayes, Valerie Harris
on line two for you. She says ft's urgent.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.239
- Valerie, what's happening?
- We lost Audrey.

25:25.320 --> 25:29.393
- What?
- She transferred the tracker to a DWP truck.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.199
Dammit. How? She's got no field experience.

25:32.280 --> 25:37.593
I don't know. We only found it cos the DWP
guy stopped to check a faulty power line.

25:37.680 --> 25:42.993
AII right, hold your positions
and wait for my instructions.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.637
- Wiles) Papazian.
- Audrey ditched her transponder.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.314
Redirect satellite surveillance and track her.

25:49.400 --> 25:53.916
I can redirect Caltrans and one sat-link,
but the rest are dedicated to finding Bauer.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.993
Following Audrey should lead us to him.
Tell me when you've got something.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.470
Take the wall.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.516
Watch him.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.798
Just do what he says, Carl,
and you'll be home before you know it.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.631
What's the emergency procedure?

26:28.720 --> 26:31.518
I have 30 seconds to put my key in,
then I enter my code.

26:31.600 --> 26:36.071
If you enter the wrong code and alert the
police, your wife is dead. Do you understand?

26:36.160 --> 26:38.071
- Yes.
- Let's go.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.351
Where's the vault?

27:07.440 --> 27:12.116
Take us around the back.
Stay away from the windows.

27:21.480 --> 27:25.632
- How do I open it?
- It's a lz-digit code, but it's a timed unlock.

27:25.720 --> 27:30.316
It allows enough time for the police to arrive
if someone triggers the silent alarm.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.789
Write the code down for me.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.195
Take him to one of the desks.
Keep an eye on him.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.714
You heard him.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.110
I know you.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.912
- No, you don't.
- I do. You're David Palmer's brother.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.391
I saw you on TV this morning.
You were there when he was shot.

28:00.480 --> 28:04.553
What the hell are you doing in my bank,
and who is he?

28:04.640 --> 28:07.871
I know it's absurd to ask you to trust me
in these circumstances,

28:07.960 --> 28:10.918
- but, believe me, you don't want to know.
- Oh, come on!

28:11.000 --> 28:14.675
You threaten me with a gun,
you kidnap me, you're robbing my bank.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.590
I deserve to know
what the hell is going on here.

28:22.920 --> 28:26.196
We believe there's evidence
in one of your safety deposit boxes

28:26.280 --> 28:30.353
that's donna prove who was behind
the assassination of my brother, OK?

28:30.440 --> 28:32.078
Wayne.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.470
- What's going on?
- What could I say? He recognised me.

28:39.560 --> 28:44.315
It's all right. Mr Mossman,
how long is the delay before the vault opens?

28:44.400 --> 28:47.153
Five minutes. Is that true?
Is that why you are here?

28:47.240 --> 28:48.468
Yes.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.996
Why don't you wait and get a subpoena?

28:52.080 --> 28:54.355
The people behind this would never let us.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.352
They've already tried to kill me twice tonight,

28:57.440 --> 29:02.036
and they're donna try again
the very first chance they get.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.673
Mom!

29:09.840 --> 29:14.391
Ms Martin, you're in shock,
but you're donna be OK.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.672
You know my name?

29:28.280 --> 29:30.157
Where's Bauer?

29:43.960 --> 29:47.555
You did? Well, that's good. I'm glad.

29:47.640 --> 29:50.313
1.11 get back to you.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.919
- I thought you went to bed.
- No.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.753
1, uh, watched you with the press.

29:57.840 --> 30:02.550
Well, um, that was Maul,
and he thought it went pretty well.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.517
Good.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.989
But that doesn't begin to describe it.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.677
Charles, you have had to
deal with more crises today

30:10.760 --> 30:14.230
than any president in an entire term.

30:14.320 --> 30:17.915
You... were magnificent.

30:20.200 --> 30:24.113
Magnificent? Well, I like the sound of that.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.395
Especially coming from you.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.071
I'm so proud of you.

30:31.160 --> 30:35.756
I hope I haven't embarrassed you
too much as your first lady.

30:35.840 --> 30:42.359
Don't be ridiculous. You walked up to the
edge a couple of times, but nobody noticed.

30:42.440 --> 30:46.035
1.11 try to find a compliment
in there somewhere.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.588
I'm sorry, Marty. I didn't...

30:58.480 --> 31:00.072
Wow.

31:00.160 --> 31:05.837
I was selfish today. You had so much on your
plate, you didn't need me piling more on.

31:05.920 --> 31:11.040
- No...
- Don't say anything. Just accept my apology.

31:11.120 --> 31:15.079
I do, I do. I accept your apology.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.909
- I have to take this privately.
- Who is it?

31:27.000 --> 31:30.549
- What difference does it make?
- I thought the crisis was over.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.234
- I thought you and 1...
- AII right.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.399
- Yes.
- We know Bauer's location.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.630
Evelyn gave him up.

31:45.720 --> 31:49.110
- Well, then, take care of it.
- My men are heading there now.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.875
- Good. Let me know when it's done.
- I will.

31:57.600 --> 32:04.199
I'm sorry, honey. I guess I haven't
gotten used to the idea that the crisis is over.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.997
- When what's done?
- What?

32:07.080 --> 32:11.471
- You just said, "Let me know when it's done."
- That was Jamie.

32:11.560 --> 32:16.429
I asked her to write me a radio speech
for tomorrow morning.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.911
- We found Audrey Raines.
- Where?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.150
Heading north toward Mulholland.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.470
- Get me Harris.
- Yes, madam.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.596
There.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.680
- Harris.
- Valerie, we have a fix on Raines.

32:34.760 --> 32:39.834
She's heading toward the Sepulveda Pass,
coming up on Mulholland.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.558
Let's go.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.790
- Chloe, do you have a minute?
- No.

32:59.880 --> 33:04.078
- What is it?
- I was assigned to log all video activity.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.628
But part of the vector's locked out.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.190
- What do you mean?
- Someone's taken control of a satellite

33:10.280 --> 33:13.033
using a class-one priority override.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.271
- Do you know anything about it?
- No. 1.11 look into it.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.351
Thanks.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.312
Crap.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.440
- Yes.
- AII points covered. Perimeter is secure.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.193
- Do you have a visual?
- Yes, I did briefly.

34:00.280 --> 34:05.673
AII right, listen. You tell your men the instant
that Bauer steps outside that bank building,

34:05.760 --> 34:09.230
you take him down,
then kill the others and secure the recording.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.839
- Which one is it?
- 23.

34:19.639 --> 34:23.155
Mr Palmer, I admired your brother
a great deal. He was a great man.

34:23.239 --> 34:25.514
Thank you.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.831
- It had to be done.
- I decide that.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.797
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.

34:34.880 --> 34:39.908
Palmer found out
about your involvement. He called your wifed

34:40.000 --> 34:45.677
I can handle my wife. My concern
is keeping this operation from collapsing.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.956
- That's Logan.
- AII threads end with Cummings.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.679
He thinks he's running this. Keep it that way.

34:51.760 --> 34:56.038
I know my part, Mr Henderson.
Youjust do as youre told.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.634
- Oh, my God!
- We got what we need.

34:58.720 --> 35:03.794
I'm sorry we put you through this. It'II be
safer for you to stay here. Please let us out.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.916
I'd like to help. I've come this far.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.310
- We'II need your car a little longer.
- Sure. It's insured.

35:09.400 --> 35:14.269
Wayne, there's someone outside.
Mr Mossman, get back in the vault now.

35:14.360 --> 35:17.591
- Is there any other way out?
- No, front door only. Security.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.557
Dammit.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.552
80th of you, stay here. 1.11 be right back.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.990
- Men are taking up positions.
- We'II have to turn ourselves in.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.038
They didn't come here to arrest us,
they came to kill us.

36:01.120 --> 36:05.318
- What are they waiting for?
- They're waiting for us to leave the building.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.675
So what do you hanna do?

36:07.760 --> 36:10.115
- How do you trip the silent alarm?
- A key.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.078
But if you trip that,
LAPD will be here within minutes.

36:13.160 --> 36:17.358
That's what I want. Henderson's men
outnumber us. If we leave now, we lose.

36:17.440 --> 36:20.159
The cops get the recording
if we go into custody.

36:20.240 --> 36:25.109
We won't. When Henderson finds out LAPD
have arrived, his men will engage them.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.510
He doesn't want the police
to have the recording either.

36:28.600 --> 36:32.912
- They shoot each other. How does that help?
- We have to use that as a diversion.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.390
It's our only way out. Trigger the alarm.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.758
Let's get ready.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.989
Valerie, the feed should be coming through
to your laptop now.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.799
I've got her. She's heading west on Chandler.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.713
- How close are you to Audrey's car?
- About two mites.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.109
- Close the gap to one mile.
- Will do.

37:37.400 --> 37:40.312
Something's wrong. The feed's breaking up.

37:41.600 --> 37:44.797
We're experiencing the same difficulty
with ours. Hold on.

37:44.880 --> 37:47.519
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

37:48.120 --> 37:50.429
That satellite's positioned correctly.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.000
I'm tracing the corruption.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.429
It's the server.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.751
- What is it?
- O'Brian's gone.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.953
- What were you doing?
- What?

38:45.040 --> 38:47.156
What were you doing?

38:47.240 --> 38:52.712
Are you kidding? If you really want
the details, 1.11 write you a report.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.198
Let's go. Now.

39:14.320 --> 39:18.916
They're here. Mr Mossman, like I said before,
it might be safer for you to stay here.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.028
If these guys find me, they assume I know
about the recording, they kill me, right?

39:26.400 --> 39:28.550
1.11 take my chances with you.

39:30.600 --> 39:34.309
Stay as close to Mr Palmer as you can.
1.11 provide cover fire.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.233
Once we leave the bank, you break left.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.277
- Yes, sir?
- What's your status?

39:40.360 --> 39:45.593
- No change. They haven't come out.
- They've seen you. Tell your men to move in.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.194
Dammit. The cops are here.

39:48.280 --> 39:52.751
- We can't let 'em have Bauer. Take 'em down.
- Yes, sfr.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.395
Drop your weapons!

39:56.480 --> 39:59.278
Take 'em out! Now!

40:00.600 --> 40:02.397
Let's go.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.674
We need to go to the police car now. Move!

40:35.280 --> 40:36.998
He's been hit!

41:05.320 --> 41:07.880
- How's he doing?
- He's dead.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.753
Dammit.

41:12.920 --> 41:16.071
- Where are you?
- On my way. Has your father agreed to meet?

41:16.160 --> 41:18.628
He's landing at Van Nuys airport
in 15 minutes.

41:18.720 --> 41:22.269
- I'm here now.
- Good. We got the evidence.

41:22.360 --> 41:25.511
- Have you listened to it?
- There's no doubt it's Logan.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.875
You understand what this means?

41:27.960 --> 41:31.839
We're talking about taking down
the President of the United States.

41:32.305 --> 41:38.660
