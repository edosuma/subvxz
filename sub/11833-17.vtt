WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.170
When did this happen?

00:04.204 --> 00:05.405
Eight days ago.

00:05.438 --> 00:07.173
Why didn't the hospital
notify the police?

00:07.207 --> 00:09.042
Admitting says
he wasn't convinced

00:09.075 --> 00:10.677
a crime had been committed.
I don't believe him.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.513
He also says he wanted her
to heal first

00:12.546 --> 00:14.180
before asking
any tough questions.

00:14.214 --> 00:15.682
That may be true.

00:15.716 --> 00:16.750
She's been read her rights?

00:16.783 --> 00:18.151
Twice.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.385
She didn't ask
for a lawyer.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.354
She hasn't said anything.
She won't talk.

00:32.398 --> 00:35.702
Hi, Jenny.
My name's Helen Gamble.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.538
I'm the District Attorney.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.173
I know you're scared.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.142
Being brought in by the police--

00:42.175 --> 00:43.710
you must be terrified.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.113
But I'm not the police, okay?

00:47.147 --> 00:50.116
And I think
I can help you,

00:50.150 --> 00:52.118
but you're gonna
have to trust me first.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.454
I-I just want to leave.

00:54.487 --> 00:56.823
And I will
make sure you do.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.727
But first I...

01:00.761 --> 01:02.729
I just want you to tell me
what happened, okay?

01:03.764 --> 01:06.266
Now, Dr. Matthews said
you tried to kill yourself.

01:06.299 --> 01:07.367
Is that true?

01:09.302 --> 01:11.137
Can you tell me why?

01:11.171 --> 01:12.506
Because.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.209
I know this stuff is hard
to talk about,

01:16.242 --> 01:18.378
so tell you what--

01:18.411 --> 01:20.213
I'll tell you what
I do know,

01:20.246 --> 01:22.849
and you can fill in some
of the blanks, all right?

01:22.883 --> 01:24.851
Your mom threw you out
of the house.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.487
When did she
throw you out, Jenny?

01:27.521 --> 01:29.289
The day before.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.324
The day before you tried
to take your life.

01:31.357 --> 01:32.693
Yes.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.194
Did she throw you out

01:34.227 --> 01:36.196
because she was angry
that you were pregnant?

01:36.763 --> 01:37.764
Yes.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.866
And you were seven months.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.638
Why was she so upset?
Do you know?

01:46.673 --> 01:48.609
She used to always say,

01:48.642 --> 01:51.311
"Don't go
and get knocked up."

01:51.344 --> 01:53.313
It was a big thing with her.

01:53.346 --> 01:54.781
So when she found out,

01:54.815 --> 01:57.751
she kind of went berserk
and stuff.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.721
Told me my life
would be ruined and...

02:00.754 --> 02:02.122
I don't know.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.489
What about your dad?

02:03.524 --> 02:04.691
I don't have a dad.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.562
My mother doesn't even know
who he is or was.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.700
I think that's...

02:15.468 --> 02:17.170
She got knocked up.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.375
I was probably the baby
that ruined her life.

02:22.843 --> 02:23.877
You being pregnant,

02:23.910 --> 02:26.647
this was sort of
a huge disaster, huh?

02:26.680 --> 02:29.783
Were you upset when she
threw you out of the house?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.585
Yes.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.521
Is that the reason you tried
to kill yourself?

02:36.356 --> 02:37.524
Probably.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.529
Are you really
going to help me?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.230
You have my word.

02:47.634 --> 02:51.237
I saw that after
you stabbed yourself,

02:51.271 --> 02:53.339
I see you then got yourself
to a hospital.

02:56.743 --> 02:59.312
Did you then decide
you really wanted to live?

03:00.514 --> 03:02.749
Yeah. I mean,
it was hurting so bad,

03:02.783 --> 03:05.285
I just wanted the pain
to go away.

03:06.252 --> 03:07.921
Did you really think
you would kill yourself

03:07.954 --> 03:10.223
by stabbing yourself
in the stomach, Jenny?

03:11.491 --> 03:12.959
I don't know.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.800
When I was 19,
I got pregnant.

03:21.735 --> 03:22.969
I had an abortion.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.639
I was way too young
for a baby.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.510
What are you, 15?

03:31.678 --> 03:33.747
Look, it's okay.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.549
You need to talk
about this.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.751
You can't try
to bear this alone.

03:37.784 --> 03:39.953
Trust me.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.855
I tried to keep
everything inside,

03:41.888 --> 03:43.657
and it caused me more pain

03:43.690 --> 03:46.527
than anything else
in my whole life.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.495
It's okay to talk
about it, Jenny.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.735
When you stabbed yourself,

03:54.768 --> 03:57.571
you were only trying to kill
the baby, weren't you?

03:59.072 --> 04:02.843
It's okay, Jenny.
You're only 15 years old.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.711
For you to try
to raise a child,

04:04.745 --> 04:06.713
your mom had thrown you
out of the house...

04:08.949 --> 04:10.784
You were only trying
to kill the baby,

04:10.817 --> 04:12.619
isn't that right?

04:15.321 --> 04:19.291
You thought if you could
make the baby go away,

04:19.325 --> 04:20.961
things would be better.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.666
It's okay, sweetheart.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.602
I'm gonna help you.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.338
But first I'm going to
send someone in

04:32.372 --> 04:34.608
to write down the things
we talked about,

04:34.641 --> 04:36.510
then I'm going to
help you get out.

04:38.344 --> 04:39.680
I promise.

04:49.656 --> 04:50.991
Get her statement.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.298
(music playing)

05:41.775 --> 05:43.409
This is the first trial
of it's kind

05:43.443 --> 05:45.612
where a woman
is actually being charged

05:45.646 --> 05:47.080
with fornicating her husband
to death.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.915
Jeez, it's on every channel.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.784
MAN: And she's now accused
of inducing his heart attack

05:50.817 --> 05:52.553
with sexual intercourse.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.556
The defense firm of Donnell,
Young, Dole, and Frutt...

05:55.589 --> 05:57.423
Hey, I got to run down
to the courthouse.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.992
Favor for Helen--
some homicide case.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.961
Helen's asking a favor
on a homicide case?

06:00.994 --> 06:02.729
I'll call you
when I know more.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.397
...bother some men, however.

06:04.430 --> 06:07.433
In one of the more
amusing polls, 33 percent

06:07.467 --> 06:09.035
of the men said
they would nevertheless

06:09.069 --> 06:11.404
still want to have sex
with the black widow,

06:11.437 --> 06:14.107
fully knowing she might then
try to kill them.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.109
I would.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.878
Ew.
REBECCA: Jimmy.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.447
MAN: 32622-- Commonwealth
v. Jennifer Holbrook,

06:21.481 --> 06:22.549
murder in the first degree.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.984
Ellenor Frutt
for the defendant.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.119
Waive reading--
we enter a plea of not guilty.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.954
Helen Gamble
for the Commonwealth.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.523
Your Honor,
I'd like to conference.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.991
I think we can
dispose of it today.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.126
A first degree
murder case?

06:33.159 --> 06:34.761
I'd like to conference.

06:34.795 --> 06:39.132
Let's go.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.803
Jenny, I'm Ellenor Frutt,
and I'm your attorney here.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.005
And right now I'm going
to go back there,

06:45.038 --> 06:47.440
and I'm going to
talk to the judge and
the district attorney,

06:47.473 --> 06:49.442
and then I'm gonna come
back and talk to you, okay?

06:49.475 --> 06:50.977
Okay.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.946
Okay, it's very important
that you don't talk

06:52.979 --> 06:55.816
to anybody about this--
nobody.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.151
All right, I'll be back
in a few minutes.

07:01.522 --> 07:04.024
(reporters clamoring)
MAN: Mrs. Hanson,
how do you feel

07:04.057 --> 07:06.593
about being labeled
the black widow?

07:06.627 --> 07:08.128
Come on, guys,
just let us through.

07:08.161 --> 07:11.197
What about the deaths
of your other husbands?

07:11.231 --> 07:13.767
Are you worried about
being judged on your appearance

07:13.800 --> 07:15.168
and not the merits
of this case?

07:15.201 --> 07:17.137
BOBBY: It's a prior bad act
and inadmissible under--

07:17.170 --> 07:18.672
It goes to pattern, Your Honor.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.240
She killed her last husband,
she killed this one.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.776
She killed neither,
and two cannot make
a pattern, anyway.

07:22.809 --> 07:25.746
She could have killed
her first husband as well.
That would make three.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.914
Her first husband died
of cancer. What are you saying?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.183
She's clever.
(laughter)

07:30.216 --> 07:32.052
(gavel bangs)
JUDGE KIMBALL: Settle down.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.220
I'll remove you all
if I have to.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.723
My client was never charged
with the murder of her previous
husband,

07:36.757 --> 07:38.759
and to allow the prosecution--
She was and still
is suspected.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.694
Three marriages,
three dead husbands--

07:40.727 --> 07:41.928
That's a pattern.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.631
I'm going to allow it.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.633
Appealed.
So noted. Anything else?

07:46.667 --> 07:47.834
No, Your Honor.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.536
Is the Commonwealth ready
for trial?

07:49.570 --> 07:51.705
Ready, Your Honor.
Mr. Donnell?

07:51.738 --> 07:53.974
Ready.
Two o'clock. Till then...

07:58.679 --> 08:00.514
I'm not sure that was
the old college try.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.783
Just preserving the objection
for appeal.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.951
The truth is I want them
to introduce this stuff.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.220
Why?

08:07.253 --> 08:08.755
Because it's been
in the papers for months.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.657
There's no way those jurors
haven't heard of it.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.626
We'll need to address it,
Courtney.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.227
They're not calling you
the black widow

08:14.260 --> 08:15.762
because you like bugs.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.868
She was thrown out of the house
by her own mother,

08:21.902 --> 08:24.004
she's never had a father,
she's 15 years old.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.939
I'd just like
to do this quietly

08:25.972 --> 08:27.974
before it becomes front page
of the Metro section,

08:28.008 --> 08:29.643
which it would be.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.111
What's your offer?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.847
I'll give involuntary
manslaughter-- three years.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.717
That way she's out
when she's 18 instead of 21.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.585
She might have a shot
at a life.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.986
Well, I need to look
at her file.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.056
I'll talk it over with her,
but that sounds great.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.860
Ms. Gamble said
she'd help me.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.762
She is, Jenny, trust me.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.632
Involuntary manslaughter
is a very good offer,

08:51.665 --> 08:54.134
considering this happened
in your third trimester.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.137
You could be out
by the time you're 18.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.073
And even if we went to trial
and won on diminished capacity,

09:00.106 --> 09:02.876
you're still looking
at as much time.

09:02.909 --> 09:06.146
So I should plead guilty?

09:06.179 --> 09:09.215
Well, first I want you to
undergo a psychiatric exam,

09:09.249 --> 09:10.684
then I'd like
to review your statement

09:10.717 --> 09:12.586
and the police report
a little more, but...

09:14.220 --> 09:16.590
...yes, it's an excellent deal,

09:16.623 --> 09:18.224
and I think
we should jump at it.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.703
Has your mom come
to see you yet?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.573
I don't think
she even knows.

09:36.643 --> 09:37.644
Could you tell her?

09:37.678 --> 09:38.779
Sure.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.884
I'm gonna get Lucy Hatcher,
my assistant, to come
and talk to you.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.219
We're gonna need to get you
some new clothes for court.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.922
Okay? All right.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.859
I'm gonna be in touch.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.976
And were you able
to determine the cause
of death, doctor?

10:10.010 --> 10:12.178
Acute cardiac arrest.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.047
You did toxicology tests?
We did.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.182
Anything remarkable
in those tests?

10:16.216 --> 10:19.986
We found traces of the drug
commonly known as Viagra.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.823
I never, ever prescribed
Viagra for Jerry.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.191
Did you ever talk
about Viagra with him?

10:25.225 --> 10:28.829
Yes, we did, and I told him,
in no uncertain terms,

10:28.862 --> 10:31.331
taking that drug
would be a death sentence.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.999
Why is that, doctor?

10:33.033 --> 10:34.735
Jerry had a weak heart.

10:34.768 --> 10:38.004
He'd gone through two
separate bypass operations.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.773
The very last thing
he should have been taking

10:39.806 --> 10:43.243
is a pill to facilitate
sexual marathons.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.145
The reason you had talked
about Viagra

10:45.178 --> 10:46.847
with Jerry Hanson
is because he wanted it,

10:46.880 --> 10:48.248
isn't that right, doctor?

10:48.281 --> 10:50.951
I wouldn't prescribe it.
But he wanted it.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.720
He wanted to be able to perform
better with his wife, yes.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.255
He... wanted it.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.090
Yes, but I--
Thank you.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.825
In addition to being
Jerry Hanson's doctor,

10:58.859 --> 11:00.093
were you also his friend?

11:00.126 --> 11:01.394
Yes, I was.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.229
His death was
very upsetting for you.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.065
Do they teach that
in law school,

11:05.098 --> 11:07.367
it's upsetting
when friends die?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.769
KIMBALL: Doctor.

11:08.802 --> 11:09.903
Of course I'm upset.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.271
And if you believe
my client

11:11.304 --> 11:12.973
was responsible
for his death,

11:13.006 --> 11:14.440
you'd want to see her
convicted, wouldn't you?

11:14.474 --> 11:16.442
Objection.
Goes to bias.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.011
You've made the point.
Move on.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.849
Doctor, you said Jerry
wanted to perform better
with my client.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.018
Yes.
Sexually perform.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.987
Yes, sexually perform.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.355
She wanted him
to perform better

11:29.389 --> 11:31.157
and he wanted
to perform better.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.326
She played these
mind games with him,

11:33.359 --> 11:34.928
made him feel inadequate.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.763
Well, if he were
feeling inadequate,

11:36.797 --> 11:39.199
could that be why
he wanted the Viagra?
Possibly, but I--

11:39.232 --> 11:41.101
And if you wouldn't
give it to him,
you make no room

11:41.134 --> 11:44.070
for the possibility
that he might go get it
someplace else?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.773
Well, why was it ground up
and put into wine?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.775
Move to strike.
If he wanted to take it--

11:48.809 --> 11:50.744
Move to strike!
She laced the wine
and killed him!

11:50.777 --> 11:52.846
Move to strike!
Doctor, that's enough!

11:55.115 --> 11:58.384
Doctor, did you advise
Jerry Hanson

11:58.418 --> 12:01.287
to refrain from sexual
intercourse altogether?

12:02.155 --> 12:05.926
No. I told him
to be very careful
and take it slow.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.861
Well, then why couldn't
he take the drug

12:07.894 --> 12:11.932
just to help him perform,
but carefully and slowly?

12:12.966 --> 12:14.100
People with heart conditions

12:14.134 --> 12:15.936
do use this drug sometimes,

12:15.969 --> 12:17.203
isn't that right, doctor?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.905
Yes, but I didn't think

12:18.939 --> 12:20.106
it was indicated
for Jerry.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.241
Why not?

12:21.274 --> 12:22.776
Because knowing Jerry,

12:22.809 --> 12:25.512
I was afraid he would try
to keep up with her.

12:25.546 --> 12:30.116
And add Viagra,
his heart might
give out before--

12:30.150 --> 12:31.552
And knowing Jerry's nature,

12:31.585 --> 12:33.253
he wouldn't
have the sense to stop.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.321
Was that your fear?
Yes.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.958
Thank you, doctor.

12:43.830 --> 12:44.497
Ms. Holbrook?

12:45.165 --> 12:46.032
Yeah.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.068
My name is Ellenor Frutt.
I'm an attorney.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.335
What do you want?

12:49.369 --> 12:51.404
I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.341
Is she dead?
Who?

12:55.375 --> 12:56.409
Jenny.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.445
Oh, no, no, no, no.
She's not dead.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.983
But her baby is,
and she has been charged
with its death.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.185
She's in custody now,
and I'm representing her.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.853
What's gonna happen to her?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.189
Well, she may have to go

13:09.222 --> 13:11.257
to a juvenile detention center
until she's 18.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.893
That's what we're hoping for.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.128
Three years?

13:15.161 --> 13:17.497
Baby lasts a lot longer
than that.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.032
She made out good.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.468
Yeah.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.282
MAN: We tested the wine.
The results indicated

13:36.316 --> 13:38.985
there were remnants
of Viagra in it.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.453
PROSECUTOR: And what
if any conclusions

13:40.486 --> 13:42.422
did you draw
from this, Detective?

13:42.455 --> 13:45.992
That the Viagra
had been ground up
and put into the wine.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.894
Her previous
husband, Mr. Carter,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.230
died of an insulin overdose.
Accidental?

13:50.263 --> 13:53.133
There was evidence
to support that he was
killed by the defendant,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.068
who was still married
to him at the time.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.137
What evidence?
He was a diabetic.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.306
He gave himself
insulin injections daily

14:00.340 --> 14:03.209
and had been for years
without incident.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.478
And here we had
a massive overdose.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.448
It was hard for us to believe
that he could have made
such a huge mistake.

14:08.481 --> 14:12.152
Latent fingerprints
on the syringe matched
the defendant.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.154
She inherited
under the will,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.456
which gave financial motive.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.992
You never charged Mrs. Hanson
with Mr. Carter's death.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.494
No. We were never able
to collect enough evidence.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.130
In fact, the truth is,
you had no evidence

14:24.164 --> 14:26.567
other than your suspicion,
isn't that right, detective?

14:26.600 --> 14:28.168
Her prints
were on the syringe.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.237
She could have handed him
the syringe like she said.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.573
Possible?

14:32.606 --> 14:35.008
Possible.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.010
EUGENE: We're
missing something.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.311
Why?

14:38.344 --> 14:40.046
Their case is lousy.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.115
It's all
circumstantial innuendo.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.484
Marcia Scott is a smart DA,

14:44.518 --> 14:46.452
and she's hasn't put
anything on the table.

14:47.621 --> 14:48.989
We're missing something.

14:51.958 --> 14:56.096
Courtney. Are we?

14:56.129 --> 14:59.499
No. I mean--
What's the son
going to say?

14:59.533 --> 15:02.703
Just what we talked about.
But he's had an agenda
from the beginning.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.939
He never even wanted me
to marry his father
in the first place.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.107
Why?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.510
He was afraid
I'd kill him--

15:11.277 --> 15:12.546
Because of all the suspicion

15:12.579 --> 15:14.247
around my previous
husband's death.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.218
Well, they must think
he's some kind of witness,

15:18.251 --> 15:20.220
because they're resting
on his testimony.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.223
We're missing something.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.528
They could rest by midday
tomorrow, so let's go
over your testimony.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.295
I go first?

15:29.763 --> 15:31.665
Courtney, you're
first and last.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.499
You're all we have.

15:40.574 --> 15:42.208
How'd it go?

15:42.242 --> 15:44.545
All right.
Did you tell her mother?

15:44.578 --> 15:46.212
Yeah.
You know what she said?

15:46.246 --> 15:47.548
"Three years? Not so bad.

15:47.581 --> 15:49.115
A baby lasts longer
than three years."

15:49.149 --> 15:51.552
(sighs)

15:51.585 --> 15:54.454
Ellenor, Helen told her
she could leave.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.557
What do you mean,
she told her she could leave?

15:56.590 --> 15:58.324
If she told what happened,
she could leave,

15:58.358 --> 15:59.660
that's what Helen said.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.762
She also told Jenny
about her own abortion,

16:01.795 --> 16:03.564
and how she needed
to talk about it.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.433
I think she was tricked
into that confession.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.773
She told you she
had an abortion?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.474
Yes.
And what else?

16:14.508 --> 16:16.510
Just how hard
it was for her

16:16.543 --> 16:19.479
and how she made it worse
by keeping it all inside.

16:19.513 --> 16:22.148
She said it would
be better for me

16:22.182 --> 16:24.184
to tell her,
and that if I did,

16:24.217 --> 16:25.786
she'd make sure
I could leave jail.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.187
What else?

16:27.220 --> 16:28.689
She just kept saying how,
you know,

16:28.722 --> 16:32.526
she understood how I would
want to make the baby go away,

16:32.559 --> 16:35.228
and how my life...

16:36.462 --> 16:38.064
I thought she'd help me.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.335
She never said
I'd be convicted of murder.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.571
She never said that.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.458
My first husband?
How is he relevant?

17:05.491 --> 17:08.294
Well, we have to cover
the "old" thing.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.564
All your husbands
were years older.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.633
It's a question
the jury will be asking,

17:12.665 --> 17:14.267
and I'd like
to answer it.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.304
It's not something
I really want to get into

17:18.338 --> 17:21.141
on the witness stand
in front of a roomful
of reporters.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.076
Well, get into it now,

17:23.108 --> 17:25.078
and I'll decide whether
it's useful or not.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.784
I, uh...

17:32.152 --> 17:35.221
...began to develop
when I was 11.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.190
My older brothers' friends
were copping feels

17:37.223 --> 17:38.625
by the time I was 12.

17:38.659 --> 17:41.494
When I was 15, college guys
were hitting on me.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.197
Even now, your colleague
Mr. Berluti...

17:45.799 --> 17:47.133
and even you...

17:49.570 --> 17:51.271
...have your thoughts.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.141
Me? W-What have I done?

17:55.175 --> 17:58.645
It's beside the point.
The point is...

17:58.679 --> 18:02.816
I've been on my guard
with men my whole life.

18:03.617 --> 18:07.087
The only man I ever felt
safe with growing up
was my dad.

18:08.488 --> 18:12.258
So I suppose on some level,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.327
my attraction to older men...

18:16.162 --> 18:20.433
is more about my being drawn
to the safety of...

18:23.570 --> 18:25.205
I don't know.

18:25.238 --> 18:28.709
I hope that you don't feel
that I've been--

18:28.742 --> 18:31.778
You've been nothing
but totally professional.

18:31.812 --> 18:34.247
But I know when a man's
attracted to me.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.117
Sometimes even before he does.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.389
Bobby, are you gonna
be much longer?

18:44.257 --> 18:45.391
No, I just--

18:45.425 --> 18:46.727
We're just about finished.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.474
Ellenor,
you didn't tell her?

19:01.508 --> 19:03.176
I don't
want her prepared.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.779
MAN: 32622-- Commonwealth
v. Jennifer Holbrook,

19:05.812 --> 19:07.881
murder in the first degree.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.617
Your Honor, both parties
offer joint recommendation

19:10.651 --> 19:11.952
as was discussed
in conference.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.287
I'm sure Ms. Holbrook--
Actually, Your Honor,
defense rescinds

19:14.320 --> 19:16.422
its agreement on the plea
and instead brings a motion

19:16.456 --> 19:17.724
to suppress
Ms. Holbrook's confession.

19:17.758 --> 19:19.626
Ellenor.
On what grounds?

19:19.660 --> 19:22.262
My client's statement was
a result of coercion.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.665
It was also obtained
in violation of her
Fifth Amendment rights.

19:24.698 --> 19:25.966
What are you
talking about?

19:25.999 --> 19:27.400
Miranda. My client
didn't understand--

19:27.433 --> 19:29.335
She was read
her rights twice.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.672
And then she was basically
unread them, Helen.

19:31.705 --> 19:33.640
What?
What's going on here?

19:33.674 --> 19:36.610
Ms. Gamble told my client
that if she gave a statement,

19:36.643 --> 19:38.612
she would get to leave.
Basically, Your Honor,

19:38.645 --> 19:42.348
where Miranda says,
"Anything you say
may be used against you,"

19:42.382 --> 19:45.819
Ms. Gamble told her,
anything you say
may be used to help you.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.254
Ms. Holbrook
is 15 years old,

19:48.288 --> 19:50.390
still in the throes of a pretty
big emotional wallop,

19:50.423 --> 19:52.693
and she believed the promises
that Ms. Gamble made.

19:52.726 --> 19:55.361
Oh, come on!
Have you ever
had an abortion?

19:56.630 --> 19:59.666
She talked to my client
about her very own abortion

19:59.700 --> 20:02.636
in order to get Jenny
to admit that she
killed her unborn child.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.638
The only thing that matters
for the purpose

20:04.671 --> 20:07.340
of a confession is, was
the suspect read her rights,

20:07.373 --> 20:09.543
and did she make
the statement voluntarily?

20:09.576 --> 20:11.444
She was, she did.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.447
And I contend she was confused
in respect to her rights--

20:14.480 --> 20:17.483
deliberately confused--
and that the statement
was not voluntary.

20:17.518 --> 20:18.952
All right.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.956
I'd like to see Ms. Holbrook
in chambers, please.

20:22.989 --> 20:23.857
Excuse me?

20:25.025 --> 20:28.261
Is there a problem with me
asking a few questions, counsel?

20:30.463 --> 20:31.998
Nice ambush, Ellenor.

20:32.032 --> 20:33.433
You know, don't talk to me
about ambush, Helen.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.368
You used me.
I did no such thing.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.870
You figured
I'd be less inclined

20:36.903 --> 20:38.639
to doubt your motives,
and I don't like it.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.440
My motive was
to help that girl.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.342
What was it when you went into
that room to interrogate her?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.645
To get her statement.
Having got a confession,

20:44.678 --> 20:46.346
I did have compassion
for her.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.648
That is why
I came to you.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.015
I don't know how,
in good conscience,

20:49.049 --> 20:50.784
you can trick
a 15-year-old.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.686
Your client
is a murderer, Ellenor.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.721
You're angry.
I understand.

20:54.755 --> 20:56.823
But don't appeal to me
on conscience.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.729
I was suspicious of her
from the very beginning.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.798
Why was that?

21:04.831 --> 21:07.634
My father was
in his 70s, frail.

21:07.668 --> 21:09.936
He wasn't what anybody
would call attractive,

21:09.970 --> 21:11.838
nor was he at all charming.

21:11.872 --> 21:13.874
And she falls
in love with him?

21:13.907 --> 21:15.642
Did your father
ever talk to you

21:15.676 --> 21:17.911
about his relationship
with the defendant?

21:17.944 --> 21:19.513
Sometimes.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.314
Specifically,
what did he talk about?

21:21.347 --> 21:25.451
Specifically, sex.
He said she was insatiable.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.688
He once said that she--
Objection. Hearsay.

21:27.721 --> 21:30.456
Did he ever seem upset
when he spoke of sex?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.092
Once he was
very excited, yes.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.960
What did he say then?
Objection.

21:33.994 --> 21:36.697
Excited utterance--
objection to the hearsay rule.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.532
He just happened to use
that word, "excited"?

21:38.565 --> 21:39.800
This witness
has been coached.

21:39.833 --> 21:41.535
I object to that.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.069
All right.

21:43.103 --> 21:45.806
Mr. Donnell,
your objection is overruled.

21:45.839 --> 21:47.841
Please sit. The witness
may answer the question.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.811
What did your father
tell you, Mr. Hanson?

21:52.478 --> 21:56.482
He said she would make love
so physically sometimes,

21:56.517 --> 22:00.521
it was violent,
almost sadistic.

22:00.554 --> 22:03.389
He wondered whether
she was trying to give him
a heart attack.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.059
What else, sir?

22:06.092 --> 22:10.096
He said she'd taunt him
during sex,

22:10.130 --> 22:12.733
taunt him to go harder,

22:12.766 --> 22:16.537
like some weird
psychological punishment.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.373
I have nothing further,
Your Honor.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.383
Did she say, "I'm going
to put Viagra in his wine,

22:30.416 --> 22:32.686
and then make love to him
until he suffers a coronary"?

22:32.719 --> 22:34.955
Because that would be
good testimony, Mr. Hanson.

22:34.988 --> 22:36.089
Maybe you should
have her say that.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.958
Objection.
Withdrawn.

22:38.959 --> 22:40.727
Did your father feel
his life was in danger?

22:40.761 --> 22:43.029
Well, I think
a little, he did.

22:43.063 --> 22:45.131
Did you take him seriously?
Yes.

22:45.165 --> 22:46.700
Did you notify the police,

22:46.733 --> 22:48.134
talk to my client,
express your concern?

22:48.168 --> 22:51.071
No.
So you weren't concerned?

22:51.104 --> 22:53.674
You took the danger seriously,
but it didn't concern you.

22:53.707 --> 22:56.643
What was I supposed to do,
go to the police and say,

22:56.677 --> 22:58.679
"Hey, I think
my stepmother is trying

22:58.712 --> 23:00.714
to intercourse my father
to death"?

23:00.747 --> 23:03.517
If you were concerned, yes.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.485
Tell me, Mr. Hanson,

23:05.519 --> 23:07.554
if my client is convicted
of murder

23:07.588 --> 23:09.990
and becomes disqualified
from the inheritance,

23:10.023 --> 23:11.725
who then takes under the will?

23:12.225 --> 23:14.695
That would be me.
That would be you.

23:14.728 --> 23:17.197
You think I'm sitting in this
chair today because of money?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.432
That's exactly what I think.
I think you're a liar.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.834
Objection.
I think your testimony

23:20.867 --> 23:22.736
was false, calculated--
Objection!

23:22.769 --> 23:25.138
Are you lying
to get your father's money?
Counsel!

23:25.171 --> 23:26.873
It's just a little
too damn convenient for me.

23:26.907 --> 23:29.109
I'm sorry. My client
is being charged with murder

23:29.142 --> 23:31.712
for inducing a heart attack,
and you get up here and say,

23:31.745 --> 23:34.781
"Gee, my father told me he
was afraid she'd give him
a heart attack,"

23:34.815 --> 23:37.584
when you never said that
to anybody before, Mr. Hanson.

23:37.618 --> 23:40.020
And you remembered to add
he was excited when he said it

23:40.053 --> 23:41.955
to get around the hearsay rule--

23:41.988 --> 23:44.057
ah, probably at the district
attorney's coaching.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.492
Objection.
It's just a little
too convenient.

23:46.527 --> 23:49.596
He's badgering.
Damn right I am.
I badger liars.

23:49.630 --> 23:51.131
Mr. Young,
that's enough.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.734
You said she makes love
in a violent way.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.468
That's what he said.
She--

23:55.502 --> 23:57.538
What's violent
to a 70-year-old man?

23:57.571 --> 23:59.540
I don't know.
Well, did you ask?

24:00.707 --> 24:02.943
Your father says "violent."
You don't follow
that up, say,

24:02.976 --> 24:05.779
"Dad, what do you mean?"
I wish I had.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.114
You said she taunts,
she's sadistic,

24:08.148 --> 24:10.183
she psychologically
punishes him,

24:10.216 --> 24:13.153
and you don't even go to her
and say, "What's going on?"

24:13.186 --> 24:14.988
What kind of caring son
are you?

24:15.021 --> 24:16.256
Maybe I should
have done more--

24:16.289 --> 24:17.724
Do you know
what perjury is, Craig?

24:17.758 --> 24:19.492
Objection.
You're under oath here!

24:19.526 --> 24:20.727
Mr. Young!

24:25.566 --> 24:26.800
I'm done.

24:38.545 --> 24:42.248
And since, you know,
she was an attorney,
I thought...

24:43.750 --> 24:46.052
I thought she would
make it so I could leave.

24:46.086 --> 24:48.822
But when you
signed this statement--

24:48.855 --> 24:52.893
She said that if I told them
exactly what happened,

24:52.926 --> 24:54.895
it would be better
for me

24:54.928 --> 24:57.798
by not keeping
stuff inside, and I--

24:57.831 --> 25:00.534
She told you
she had an abortion?

25:00.567 --> 25:03.169
Yes, and how terrible
it was for her

25:03.203 --> 25:05.906
that she kept stuff
buried inside and--

25:07.307 --> 25:09.309
You lied to me.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.912
I trusted you,
and you lied to me.

25:11.945 --> 25:15.281
All right, Jenny.
The detectives told you,

25:15.315 --> 25:18.051
did they not,
that the things you said

25:18.084 --> 25:21.154
could be used against you
in a court of law?

25:21.855 --> 25:23.590
Yes.

25:23.624 --> 25:26.226
But then she came in,
and she's an attorney,

25:26.259 --> 25:28.094
and she said
they wouldn't be.

25:33.266 --> 25:36.737
Jenny, I think I'd like you
to wait outside for a minute.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.843
Keep her here, please.

25:48.348 --> 25:50.584
Aren't we resourceful?

25:50.617 --> 25:52.919
None of her civil rights
were violated.

25:52.953 --> 25:54.588
Did you have an abortion?

25:54.621 --> 25:56.056
That certainly isn't relevant.

25:56.089 --> 25:57.691
It is to me. Did you?

26:00.060 --> 26:03.263
No. Tricks are used
in interrogations
all the time.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.766
This was a lie.
Lies, too.

26:06.967 --> 26:08.802
There's nothing
unconstitutional

26:08.835 --> 26:11.037
about lying to a suspect
so long as they

26:11.071 --> 26:13.707
understand their rights,
which she did.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.610
I disagree with that.
She didn't understand
her rights.

26:16.643 --> 26:19.713
Oh, come on, we can all try
to get inside this girl's head,

26:19.746 --> 26:21.748
but that's not
the way it goes.

26:21.782 --> 26:23.884
We have constitutional
dos and don'ts.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.152
We didn't commit any
of the don'ts.

26:26.186 --> 26:28.021
The statement is valid
and admissible.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.723
That's my decision.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.893
I'm going to think
about it.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.232
We'll reconvene at 2:00.

26:41.434 --> 26:42.869
May I say something?

26:44.137 --> 26:46.707
You're all thinking
about Jenny Holbrook.

26:46.740 --> 26:50.076
I wasn't called in to talk
to Jenny Holbrook.

26:50.110 --> 26:53.146
I was brought down to question
a murder suspect,

26:53.179 --> 26:54.915
a suspect
who killed a baby,

26:54.948 --> 26:57.718
a suspect who wouldn't talk
to the police.

26:57.751 --> 27:02.222
Now, the morality
of how I tricked her
has no relevance.

27:02.255 --> 27:05.726
This isn't a moral arena,
it is a legal one.

27:05.759 --> 27:09.362
And everything I did was legal,
and she has this backstory

27:09.395 --> 27:13.066
and a fragile personality
and an abusive mother.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.969
It all seems
just so awful now.

27:16.002 --> 27:19.039
Well, here's a flash:
killers don't like to talk.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.808
It's not easy
getting these confessions.

27:21.842 --> 27:24.711
Tag a bunch
of moral strings now

27:24.745 --> 27:26.279
on top
of the constitutional ones,

27:26.312 --> 27:28.715
we will never get anybody.

27:41.862 --> 27:43.730
He brought the Viagra.

27:43.764 --> 27:45.298
Your husband did?
Yes.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.733
Did he say
where he had gotten it?

27:46.767 --> 27:48.001
No.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.202
And then you put it
in the wine?

27:49.235 --> 27:50.436
Yes.

27:50.470 --> 27:52.839
He had 50 milligrams,
one pill,

27:52.873 --> 27:55.141
and, well, we were talking
about the fact

27:55.175 --> 27:56.076
that it was now
being reported

27:56.109 --> 27:58.278
that women got benefits
from taking it, too.

27:58.311 --> 28:00.714
So more for a laugh
than anything else,

28:00.747 --> 28:03.884
we ground up the pill,
and we sprinkled it
into our wine.

28:03.917 --> 28:05.385
And then?

28:05.418 --> 28:07.821
After dinner,
we watched some television,

28:07.854 --> 28:10.991
then we went to bed,
and we made love.

28:11.024 --> 28:13.794
And the effects
of the Viagra?

28:15.095 --> 28:17.230
Well, it definitely works.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.099
And at some point...

28:19.132 --> 28:22.102
Jerry grabbed his chest.

28:22.135 --> 28:24.738
He was having
a heart attack.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.741
I called 911,
performed CPR,

28:27.774 --> 28:29.843
but by the time
the paramedics got there...

28:31.244 --> 28:32.478
...he was gone.

28:34.014 --> 28:35.181
There's been testimony

28:35.215 --> 28:37.751
that you were
extremely physical,

28:37.784 --> 28:39.219
and that you taunted
while--

28:39.252 --> 28:41.421
That's completely false.
Craig Hanson was lying.

28:41.454 --> 28:44.024
His father never said
those things to him.

28:44.057 --> 28:46.492
Our lovemaking
was never very physical.

28:46.527 --> 28:48.428
It was certainly
not violent.

28:48.461 --> 28:50.196
My husband
had a heart condition,

28:50.230 --> 28:53.066
and we were always mindful
of it-- both of us.

28:54.267 --> 28:56.069
You say your husband
brought the Viagra?

28:56.102 --> 28:57.437
That's right.

28:57.470 --> 28:59.806
Did you ever get Viagra
from your doctor?

28:59.840 --> 29:01.942
No.
Ever talk to her about

29:01.975 --> 29:03.877
the virtues
of Viagra for women?

29:03.910 --> 29:06.212
Well, yes,
we had discussed that.

29:07.147 --> 29:08.214
Okay.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.516
I have nothing
further, Your Honor.

29:12.886 --> 29:13.754
Counsel?

29:15.321 --> 29:16.823
The witness may step down.

29:19.059 --> 29:20.226
Mr. Donnell.

29:21.962 --> 29:23.463
The defense rests,
Your Honor.

29:23.496 --> 29:25.465
The commonwealth calls
one rebuttal witness--

29:25.498 --> 29:27.500
Dr. Gail Parent.

29:30.070 --> 29:32.138
Who is it?
(door opens)

29:32.172 --> 29:33.406
She's my doctor.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.979
Defense objects,
Your Honor. Sidebar.

29:45.118 --> 29:46.920
This is my client's
own doctor.

29:47.487 --> 29:49.155
What's your offer
of proof?

29:49.189 --> 29:51.091
She's prepared to testify
she gave the defendant

29:51.124 --> 29:54.094
Viagra samples two days
before Jerry Hanson died.

30:04.538 --> 30:07.874
BOBBY: It's privileged
doctor/patient relationship.
She waived privilege.

30:07.908 --> 30:09.576
She opened the door.
How?

30:09.610 --> 30:12.045
During her testimony.
She had the right
to assert privilege.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.614
She didn't. She talked
about her doctor--

30:13.647 --> 30:15.148
That is so bogus.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.618
You can't selectively assert
privilege, Your Honor.

30:17.651 --> 30:19.853
The woman did answer questions

30:19.886 --> 30:21.454
about things she discussed
with her physician.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.989
I'm going to allow it.

30:23.023 --> 30:24.190
You got to be kidding me.

30:24.224 --> 30:25.859
She opened the door.

30:30.964 --> 30:32.498
I knew we were
missing something.

30:32.533 --> 30:34.000
That was their ace.

30:39.940 --> 30:41.575
You got the Viagra
from your own doctor?

30:42.543 --> 30:44.144
I was afraid of how
it would look if...

30:45.679 --> 30:48.148
People would think
that I secretly put it
in his wine.

30:48.181 --> 30:51.484
Did you?
No. It happened
exactly as I said.

30:51.518 --> 30:53.486
It didn't happen
as you said.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.922
You got the Viagra,
and now they caught you
in a lie.

30:55.956 --> 30:57.958
Our whole case
was your testimony,

30:57.991 --> 30:59.526
your credibility,
and now it's shot.

30:59.560 --> 31:00.961
Don't yell at me.

31:00.994 --> 31:02.195
You lied to us, Courtney.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.631
I didn't kill him!
We were making love!

31:04.665 --> 31:06.199
I didn't kill him!

31:06.232 --> 31:07.500
Well, that's how it looks.

31:14.508 --> 31:16.276
After your doctor
testifies,

31:16.309 --> 31:17.611
you have to get
back up there

31:17.644 --> 31:22.082
and explain to the jury
why you lied.

31:24.084 --> 31:25.652
And I hope you're good.

31:38.131 --> 31:40.500
I was just so afraid
of how it would look.

31:40.534 --> 31:43.336
Everybody thinks that
I killed my last husband.

31:43.369 --> 31:46.272
I was afraid if they knew
that I was the one
who procured the Viagra--

31:47.641 --> 31:51.177
So you lied.
Yes.

31:51.211 --> 31:54.515
But we both agreed
to put it into the wine.

31:56.249 --> 31:59.620
Courtney, why should
the jury believe you now?

31:59.653 --> 32:01.922
I don't have an answer
for that. I'm--

32:03.590 --> 32:05.191
Why should anybody believe

32:05.225 --> 32:06.660
that I could fall in love
with an older man?

32:06.693 --> 32:08.228
But I did.

32:11.698 --> 32:12.999
I did.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.403
MARCIA: Let's talk
about that.

32:17.437 --> 32:20.173
You've fallen in love
with three older men.

32:20.206 --> 32:24.377
For whatever reason,
I've found safety
in older men.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.713
They're not as predatory,
I suppose.

32:26.747 --> 32:30.316
I was telling Mr. Donnell
that it probably goes
to the safety

32:30.350 --> 32:32.118
that I found
with my own father.

32:33.286 --> 32:35.455
You felt safe
with your dad?

32:38.291 --> 32:40.594
Your dad died
serving time

32:40.627 --> 32:43.129
in Carteret Prison
in New Jersey, didn't he?

32:47.133 --> 32:48.735
He was convicted
of raping you

32:48.769 --> 32:50.403
when you were
nine years old.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.306
He was wrongly convicted.

32:55.075 --> 32:56.743
It never happened.

32:56.777 --> 32:59.713
Your mother and your sister
walked in on it.

33:01.381 --> 33:04.150
Mrs. Hanson?
It never happened.

33:04.184 --> 33:06.486
Your Honor, could I have time
to confer with my client?

33:06.520 --> 33:08.354
No, you may not.

33:08.388 --> 33:12.659
You don't find safety
with these older men,
do you, Mrs. Hanson?

33:12.693 --> 33:15.562
You find your anger--
your hatred.

33:17.798 --> 33:19.399
He was wrongly convicted.

33:21.101 --> 33:22.503
It never happened.

33:27.508 --> 33:30.511
(reporters clamoring)

33:41.722 --> 33:44.925
So, Courtney,
any other surprises?

33:48.795 --> 33:50.363
Never happened.

34:09.650 --> 34:10.551
BAILIFF: Be seated.

34:12.786 --> 34:16.156
Well, Ms. Gamble,
you're completely right.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.659
There is nothing illegal
or unconstitutional

34:18.692 --> 34:22.228
about deceiving suspects
into giving statements.

34:22.262 --> 34:24.130
It's done all the time.

34:24.164 --> 34:27.167
But still,
I can't help but think

34:27.199 --> 34:29.770
that somehow
we've lost our way.

34:29.803 --> 34:33.106
The whole point of our
constitutional safeguards

34:33.139 --> 34:37.310
is to protect the suspects
against police misconduct.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.846
Maybe you honored
the letter of the law here,

34:39.880 --> 34:42.516
but the spirit of it
took a beating.

34:43.684 --> 34:45.485
Defense counsel's argument--

34:45.518 --> 34:48.855
that a mirandized suspect was,
in effect, de-mirandized--

34:48.889 --> 34:51.424
it's a valid one.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.259
She's 15.

34:53.293 --> 34:54.828
By the time
you got through with her,

34:54.860 --> 34:57.197
she believed she'd
help herself by talking.

34:57.230 --> 34:59.432
It doesn't make sense

34:59.465 --> 35:02.603
that you could
read somebody her rights
so she'll understand,

35:02.636 --> 35:05.138
only then to deliberately
confuse her

35:05.171 --> 35:08.374
and smile
with a constitutional wink.

35:08.408 --> 35:11.545
It would seem
that the players in our system

35:11.578 --> 35:14.380
should at least act
in good faith.

35:17.651 --> 35:22.355
But as a judge,
I'm bound by precedent.

35:22.388 --> 35:26.693
And trickery still survives
any constitutional challenge.

35:28.361 --> 35:30.564
I suppose Ms. Gamble
said it best--

35:30.597 --> 35:35.468
this is a legal arena,
not a moral one.

35:37.504 --> 35:39.205
The statement is allowed.

35:39.239 --> 35:42.175
We'll conference
next Tuesday at 9:00

35:42.208 --> 35:43.877
to set a trial date.
Adjourned.

36:14.808 --> 36:17.544
Well, there's certainly been
a few surprises here today,

36:17.578 --> 36:19.680
and watching Courtney Hanson
on the stand,

36:19.713 --> 36:22.749
maybe she's got
some denial issues

36:22.783 --> 36:25.218
about what happened
to her as a child.

36:25.251 --> 36:26.887
Maybe it didn't
really happen.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.455
Obviously, the prosecution
wants you to believe

36:29.489 --> 36:30.957
that she's acting out
her anger

36:30.991 --> 36:34.695
against these older men
she married. It's a theory.

36:34.728 --> 36:38.431
But at the end of the day,
that's all they have--

36:38.464 --> 36:40.901
suspicion, jealousy,

36:40.934 --> 36:43.369
innuendo, theory.

36:43.403 --> 36:44.738
There is no evidence
to establish

36:44.771 --> 36:46.807
that she purposely caused
Jerry Hanson

36:46.840 --> 36:48.875
to have a heart attack.

36:48.909 --> 36:50.777
Suspicion, yes.

36:50.811 --> 36:54.480
But evidence?
What is there?

36:55.481 --> 36:59.285
Jerry Hanson
told his son

36:59.319 --> 37:02.255
he was afraid,

37:02.288 --> 37:05.559
the way she pushed him
during intercourse.

37:06.660 --> 37:08.562
And, yes, we can consider

37:08.595 --> 37:10.363
the way her
previous husband died

37:10.396 --> 37:12.966
because it's a pattern.

37:12.999 --> 37:15.702
Rich old men...
death...

37:16.803 --> 37:18.438
...she inherits.

37:18.471 --> 37:20.406
If his father
said he felt danger,

37:20.440 --> 37:22.042
why did this loving son
do nothing?

37:22.075 --> 37:25.378
If she gets convicted,
he inherits everything.

37:25.411 --> 37:28.014
Why is this loving son
suddenly making noise

37:28.048 --> 37:29.850
as the will
goes to probate?

37:29.883 --> 37:33.554
She ground up that Viagra
so he wouldn't detect it.

37:33.587 --> 37:34.955
Come on.

37:34.988 --> 37:37.758
A man with a weak heart,
two bypasses,

37:37.791 --> 37:40.894
she has intercourse
for over an hour?

37:40.927 --> 37:44.998
If that isn't
reckless disregard,

37:45.031 --> 37:47.300
then what is?

37:47.333 --> 37:48.669
A man with a weak heart,

37:48.702 --> 37:51.505
prone to pushing too hard,
has a coronary.

37:51.538 --> 37:52.873
They're charging murder.

37:52.906 --> 37:54.775
That's out there
to begin with.

37:54.808 --> 37:58.979
To prove it, you better have
some pretty strong evidence.

37:59.012 --> 38:00.981
They don't have any.

38:01.014 --> 38:04.518
They're asking you
to convict with suspicion.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.453
Why did she lie?

38:07.487 --> 38:09.089
If she's innocent,

38:09.122 --> 38:11.457
why didn't she
just take that stand

38:11.491 --> 38:13.326
and tell us the truth?

38:13.359 --> 38:15.328
But she didn't do that,
did she?

38:15.361 --> 38:20.634
She lied, afraid you might
get the right idea.

38:39.853 --> 38:41.454
Murder Two?

38:41.487 --> 38:42.488
Chance of parole.

38:43.389 --> 38:46.560
If you get convicted
of first degree,

38:46.593 --> 38:48.361
you go away forever.

38:51.732 --> 38:53.499
Do you think
I'll be convicted?

38:53.534 --> 38:55.669
Strictly on the evidence,
you shouldn't be,

38:55.702 --> 38:58.371
but I'm not so sure

38:58.404 --> 39:00.073
the jury won't look
beyond the evidence.

39:01.107 --> 39:03.977
The insulin OD
of your last husband,
that'll hurt.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.679
You lying on the stand...

39:08.048 --> 39:09.716
That'll hurt a lot.

39:09.750 --> 39:11.618
Bobby...

39:12.452 --> 39:13.754
I didn't do it.

39:13.787 --> 39:15.789
(door opens)

39:18.792 --> 39:19.893
Twenty-six minutes.

39:20.426 --> 39:21.762
They have a verdict?

39:23.063 --> 39:24.064
What does that mean?

39:24.097 --> 39:25.999
In this case,
I have no idea.

39:26.032 --> 39:28.434
They could have easily said,
"No evidence," or they--

39:28.468 --> 39:30.436
they could have
just quickly concluded

39:30.470 --> 39:32.405
that you're guilty.
I have no idea.

39:32.973 --> 39:35.441
Well, if we're going to
take the deal...

39:36.042 --> 39:37.410
Courtney...

39:39.646 --> 39:40.881
It's your call.

39:44.651 --> 39:46.419
I'll take my chances.

40:06.106 --> 40:08.174
Courtney, the jury
is not looking over here.

40:09.142 --> 40:11.077
That's a bad sign.

40:12.245 --> 40:14.548
If we can still
get Murder Two...

40:27.127 --> 40:29.029
They're not looking over,
not even one of them.

40:39.005 --> 40:40.473
Still on the table?

40:41.775 --> 40:43.476
I hate to rush you.

40:45.979 --> 40:47.614
Okay.

40:47.648 --> 40:48.815
Your Honor?

40:58.625 --> 40:59.760
We've reached a plea.

40:59.793 --> 41:01.595
Murder
in the second degree.

41:01.628 --> 41:03.630
It's too late. The jury's
returned its verdict.

41:03.664 --> 41:05.899
It's not too late.
The verdict hasn't been entered.

41:05.932 --> 41:08.168
We are about
to enter it, counsel.

41:08.201 --> 41:10.737
It's not entered. We have
a right to reach a plea.

41:10.771 --> 41:12.506
I'll file
an interlocutory appeal,

41:12.539 --> 41:14.040
we'll go upstairs,
and we'll argue it.

41:15.208 --> 41:16.810
You really
want to do this?

41:16.843 --> 41:18.812
We're fine with it.
It'll spare us an appeal.

41:19.746 --> 41:20.881
I don't like these

41:20.914 --> 41:22.649
last-minute stunts,
Mr. Donnell.

41:22.683 --> 41:24.017
It's not a stunt.

41:24.050 --> 41:25.786
It's a legitimate
plea agreement.

41:27.954 --> 41:29.122
Mrs. Hanson?

41:34.227 --> 41:37.531
Do you agree to plead guilty
to murder in the second degree?

41:38.865 --> 41:40.200
I do, Your Honor.

41:40.233 --> 41:42.302
(people murmuring)
So entered.

41:42.335 --> 41:44.638
Members of the jury,
thank you for your service.

41:44.671 --> 41:47.808
This matter is adjourned.
Sentencing, 2:00 Friday.

41:47.841 --> 41:49.075
(pounds gavel)

41:50.043 --> 41:51.244
(whispering) Mr. Donnell?

41:52.679 --> 41:54.247
I'm not big
on passing notes in class,

41:54.280 --> 41:55.849
but you can keep this.

42:31.918 --> 42:33.754
I think we did
the right thing.

42:37.724 --> 42:40.026
I'll be in.
We need--

42:40.060 --> 42:41.962
We need to talk
before sentencing.

42:44.765 --> 42:46.066
Okay.

42:48.034 --> 42:49.570
I think we did
the right thing.

43:42.989 --> 43:44.090
You stinker!
