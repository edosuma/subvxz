WEBVTT

02:23.586 --> 02:24.628
Mom?

02:25.588 --> 02:26.839
Mom?

02:26.839 --> 02:28.048
Present.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.300
What?

02:29.300 --> 02:31.135
Like when the teacher calls roll call,

02:31.135 --> 02:34.221
you say "present."
Mom is ready, so reportin' to duty.

02:35.431 --> 02:36.765
How come you only have one sock on?

02:36.765 --> 02:38.726
I couldn't find the other one.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.853
You can't go to school like that.

02:47.484 --> 02:50.905
Mom, can Alisa come over Friday
for a sleepover again?

02:50.905 --> 02:52.781
Yeah, if it's okay with her mom, sure.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.784
Sweetie, are we not combing our hair now,

02:55.784 --> 02:58.329
or is this just a new fashion thing
that they got by me?

02:58.329 --> 03:00.789
- I combed it.
- Well,

03:00.789 --> 03:03.000
maybe we have ourselves
a wind tunnel in the house.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.461
Why don't you go back
and comb it again, please?

03:05.461 --> 03:07.296
What kind of mother
will people think I am

03:07.296 --> 03:09.882
if you are a mop-head
and your brother's half sockless?

03:09.882 --> 03:13.260
Alisa said you worry too much
about what other people think.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.470
Excuse me?

03:15.846 --> 03:18.599
Alisa said that?
Now why would she say that?

03:23.354 --> 03:24.813
<i>She's never said that to me.</i>

03:24.813 --> 03:28.025
Well, she must have got it from somebody,
so that leaves Betty.

03:28.025 --> 03:30.653
I've never heard Betty say that.

03:30.653 --> 03:32.655
I know she doesn't like me.

03:32.655 --> 03:35.032
- What are you talking about?
- I get a feelin'.

03:36.408 --> 03:38.410
Betty adores you, Candy.

03:38.410 --> 03:42.206
You think she'd be trusting you
to look after our kids if she--

03:46.418 --> 03:49.880
The feeling you're getting
is just her usual

03:49.880 --> 03:51.674
depression stuff.

03:51.674 --> 03:53.342
Yeah, how is that goin'?

03:55.636 --> 03:57.972
Well, much better, actually.

03:57.972 --> 04:02.309
This Marriage Encounter
was really a miracle.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.897
What exactly do they do there?

04:06.897 --> 04:10.401
Well, mostly get us to talk about
our feelings and--

04:11.318 --> 04:15.656
Well, they're big into
writing everything down in a notebook.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.366
Sounds a little silly.

04:17.366 --> 04:20.369
I know. That's what we thought at first,
too, but it--

04:21.287 --> 04:22.454
it really works.

04:22.454 --> 04:24.415
For the first time
in I don't know how long

04:25.541 --> 04:26.500
we were

04:27.459 --> 04:29.753
unflinchingly honest with each other.

04:29.753 --> 04:33.090
Exactly how unflinchingly honest
could you be, Allan?

04:35.759 --> 04:37.678
Well, except for that.

04:38.929 --> 04:41.348
And it was an issue for me.

04:42.474 --> 04:46.186
Betty would bring up sex
and my lack of interest.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.939
And I'd go quiet.

04:48.939 --> 04:51.316
I couldn't exactly say
I was less interested in sex

04:51.316 --> 04:54.111
because I was having it
with Candy Montgomery.

04:54.111 --> 04:56.405
We finally opened up to each other.

04:56.405 --> 04:58.490
Well, that's good.

04:58.490 --> 05:00.909
I'm glad. So...

05:02.453 --> 05:04.079
where does that leave us?

05:05.456 --> 05:08.917
Well, it doesn't necessarily
change the way I feel about you.

05:11.253 --> 05:13.422
But I do feel strongly

05:13.422 --> 05:20.304
that I should be
giving my full resources to my family.

05:22.181 --> 05:26.226
And my relationship with you
is taking away

05:26.226 --> 05:28.771
some of my emotional availability and

05:30.105 --> 05:33.025
energy and attention
that I could be directing towards

05:34.193 --> 05:37.529
Betty and the kids.

05:39.615 --> 05:41.533
So you don't wanna see me anymore?

05:43.410 --> 05:45.079
I don't know. Yeah.

05:45.079 --> 05:48.707
They said an awful lot of things
at the Encounter but

05:50.250 --> 05:52.169
they never said you couldn't

05:53.337 --> 05:55.089
see someone else.

05:57.341 --> 06:01.804
Allan, you seem to be leaving it up to me,
so I'm just deciding.

06:02.888 --> 06:07.184
I'm not gonna call.
I'm not gonna try to see you.

06:07.184 --> 06:09.895
I won't bother you anymore.

06:13.649 --> 06:14.858
Okay.

06:15.359 --> 06:17.945
Ok-- Wow.

06:17.945 --> 06:21.490
Well, you certainly unleashed
your feelings there.

06:21.490 --> 06:25.285
Well, I'm not sure
how you want me to respond.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.287
Do you remember what you told me?

06:27.746 --> 06:31.458
That the days you spent with me
at the Como,

06:31.458 --> 06:33.544
that they were the only hours
of your week where

06:33.544 --> 06:36.088
you didn't feel responsible
for other people's emotions.

06:37.339 --> 06:40.717
Meaning Betty.
The burden of making her happy.

06:40.717 --> 06:45.264
The burden of keeping her
from being miserable.

06:45.722 --> 06:47.266
Now,

06:47.266 --> 06:49.268
have you ever

06:50.644 --> 06:53.564
felt any responsibility for my emotions?

06:54.857 --> 06:56.608
Do you now?

07:03.240 --> 07:04.491
Candy...

07:07.953 --> 07:09.121
Yeah.

07:12.958 --> 07:13.917
Okay.

07:51.246 --> 07:53.582
You realize that every time
you feel a hole,

07:53.582 --> 07:55.167
you paint the kitchen?

07:55.167 --> 07:56.752
That's not true.

07:57.836 --> 07:59.129
Okay, fine.
Maybe it's a little true,

07:59.129 --> 08:02.174
but also, you know, it is good therapy.

08:02.174 --> 08:04.760
- Well, it looks really good.
- Thank you.

08:05.260 --> 08:08.096
I keep saying
that we should start our own business.

08:08.096 --> 08:11.266
There's a lot of people in Wylie
that are looking to remake their lives,

08:11.266 --> 08:14.102
and some of which would settle
for a spiffier breakfast nook.

08:14.102 --> 08:17.606
You know, it's not even like
I'm gonna miss the sex.

08:17.606 --> 08:19.066
It's the friendship.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.526
Allan's been like my best friend.

08:22.027 --> 08:23.654
Hello?
What about me?

08:23.654 --> 08:26.657
I just wish I could talk like that
with Pat.

08:27.991 --> 08:30.369
Okay, I'm serious.

08:30.369 --> 08:32.913
Why don't we start our own business?

08:32.913 --> 08:35.707
At a minimum, it'll get us out
into other people's kitchens.

08:35.707 --> 08:38.418
That's where the real life
happens anyway, right? Kitchens?

08:38.418 --> 08:40.587
God, I'm feelin' angry.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.714
I don't necessarily want him but

08:43.799 --> 08:45.717
I don't like feeling rejected.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.264
You're gonna have to put that
in the fridge, honey, for it to keep.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.640
Or the garage.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.185
- The garage is nice and cool.
- Why does it have to stay cool?

08:55.185 --> 08:57.312
The weather this warm,
I'm afraid it'll rot,

08:57.312 --> 09:00.607
and we still have two whole weeks
before Halloween.

09:09.199 --> 09:11.576
<i>I think it's just a benign fibrous mass.</i>

09:11.576 --> 09:14.288
You can't possibly know that.
Not for sure.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.790
Betty, this is likely harmless.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.834
How dare you be impatient with me.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.335
It could be cancer.

09:21.420 --> 09:22.963
I don't think it is.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.881
But you can't know that!

09:24.881 --> 09:27.551
I actually can know it.

09:27.551 --> 09:29.720
It's my business to know it.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.514
And the mammogram confirms it.

09:32.514 --> 09:34.057
So it's nothing?

09:34.057 --> 09:38.478
It's a mass, yes.
But it's benign.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.397
You should stop taking birth control

09:41.023 --> 09:43.275
and also control your caffeine intake.

09:43.275 --> 09:45.360
It could be from drinking too much coffee?

09:45.360 --> 09:47.863
Betty, you're fine.

09:49.364 --> 09:51.825
Honey, I'm just saying

09:51.825 --> 09:54.161
that you were Luke Skywalker last year,

09:54.161 --> 09:57.122
and there are other characters
in "Star Wars."

09:57.122 --> 09:59.207
No, he wears a mask
for the other characters.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.752
He gets claustrophobia.

10:01.752 --> 10:03.670
- You puked in your Batman mask!
- Hey.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.673
- No, I didn't!
- Alright! Okay!

10:13.096 --> 10:14.890
Jenny! Wait your turn!

10:14.890 --> 10:16.350
Okay!

10:16.850 --> 10:19.102
Thank you.
Thank you.

10:19.102 --> 10:22.731
- Wait up!
- Ian, stop following me!

11:16.368 --> 11:18.286
- Hello?
-<i>Hey!</i>

11:19.204 --> 11:20.288
Candy?

11:20.789 --> 11:24.167
Sorry. I know I promised that,
that I wouldn't call,

11:24.167 --> 11:27.379
but this is just for some advice.

11:27.379 --> 11:29.464
I'm sorry. Bad manners.

11:31.049 --> 11:32.008
How are you?

11:33.301 --> 11:35.637
I'm good.
Good. How are you?

11:36.179 --> 11:38.181
You don't sound great.

11:38.181 --> 11:41.101
Well, I said good, not great.

11:42.018 --> 11:43.812
What's the matter?

11:43.812 --> 11:46.815
<i>Betty found a lump in her right breast.</i>

11:49.860 --> 11:52.571
She's fine. At least that's what
the doctors are telling her.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.574
She's already been to two.

11:55.574 --> 11:58.368
I'm sure she's looking for a third.

11:58.368 --> 12:01.746
They think it's benign,
but she's a wreck.

12:01.746 --> 12:05.041
Well, I should go over there.
Is she home now?

12:05.459 --> 12:08.170
She is, but you don't have to.

12:08.170 --> 12:11.465
No, I should go check on her.
If it were me--

12:12.299 --> 12:14.217
<i>You're a good friend, Candy.</i>

12:31.693 --> 12:33.945
- Betty.
- Hi!

12:33.945 --> 12:35.947
Hi. I just heard

12:36.740 --> 12:38.658
and I know in my heart

12:40.035 --> 12:42.204
that you're fine.

12:42.204 --> 12:43.622
Thank you.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.082
Thank you so much.

12:46.082 --> 12:49.252
You have nothin' to worry about.

12:49.252 --> 12:51.963
- I hope you're right.
- Hey, now, you listen to me.

12:52.589 --> 12:55.258
Doctors are so scared today
about bein' sued

12:55.258 --> 12:58.053
that if you go to them
with a growth of any kind,

12:58.053 --> 13:00.222
the last thing they're gonna do is say,
"Go home, it's nothin',"

13:00.222 --> 13:04.017
unless they are
pretty damn sure it's nothin'.

13:05.060 --> 13:07.604
I am sure that you're right.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.607
How did you find out?

13:10.607 --> 13:12.442
Allan told me.

13:12.442 --> 13:14.444
- Allan did?
- Yeah, he was concerned.

13:14.444 --> 13:17.572
You know how worried husbands can get.

13:17.572 --> 13:19.824
Oh, wait.
No, I got that wrong.

13:19.824 --> 13:21.409
Husbands never worry enough.

13:22.619 --> 13:24.120
That's it.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.627
Well, you didn't have to drive
all the way down here.

13:31.795 --> 13:34.965
But I cannot tell you how much
it means to me that you did.

13:34.965 --> 13:39.928
These doctors, they think
I am the biggest hypochondriac!

13:39.928 --> 13:41.763
They tell me it's nothing,
convince me it's all in my head,

13:41.763 --> 13:44.641
then write me prescriptions
for anxiety and depression,

13:44.641 --> 13:46.851
of which I'm on a gazillion.

13:46.851 --> 13:49.104
- Hi, honey!
- Hi.

13:49.104 --> 13:51.856
Can you believe
Candy drove all the way down here?

13:51.856 --> 13:54.943
She is just the sweetest.

13:54.943 --> 13:57.737
- You feeling better?
- Yes.

13:59.990 --> 14:03.660
Yes. She helped lasso my runaway brain.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.249
Look at us making you stand out here.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.667
- Come in, come in.
- Oh, no! No, no, no.

14:10.667 --> 14:14.671
I gotta get back and make dinner.
It's Meatball Tuesday.

14:14.671 --> 14:18.675
This is just one of those hug-and-runs,
now that I see that you're fine.

14:18.675 --> 14:20.552
- And you are.
- Yes.

14:21.886 --> 14:22.804
Walk Candy to her car.

14:22.804 --> 14:24.055
- Sure.
- Would you, sweetheart?

14:24.055 --> 14:26.016
Thank you again.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.934
So much.

14:29.394 --> 14:31.438
And let's get the kids together

14:31.438 --> 14:32.981
for some trick-or-treating.

14:32.981 --> 14:35.025
Sure, yeah. Perfect. I'll call you!

14:35.942 --> 14:36.901
Okay.

14:40.322 --> 14:42.657
That is not the same person.

14:42.657 --> 14:45.076
You're saying Marriage Encounter did that?

14:45.076 --> 14:47.912
I'm telling you,
she's like a flower blossoming.

14:47.912 --> 14:50.498
Yeah, and she was actually warm.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.709
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to--

14:53.752 --> 14:55.503
Yes, you did.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.631
But it's alright.
You're not wrong.

14:58.340 --> 15:01.259
- But now, she's--
- Just like a normal person.

15:04.012 --> 15:07.599
Hey, do you think that Pat and I
should get into Marriage Encounter?

15:07.599 --> 15:09.893
'Cause that's actually why
I called earlier.

15:09.893 --> 15:13.480
- Well, I'm not sure.
- Well, I gotta try somethin'.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.482
He doesn't know how to communicate.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.445
The thing is Marriage Encounter
is definitely not for couples

15:20.445 --> 15:22.947
who are having serious problems.

15:24.407 --> 15:27.869
From what you told me
about your feelings for Pat--

15:27.869 --> 15:30.872
I do love him.

15:31.623 --> 15:33.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:34.959 --> 15:37.379
But it really--
It worked for you.

15:37.379 --> 15:38.588
So far.

15:39.631 --> 15:40.965
So far, it's really worked.

15:40.965 --> 15:43.760
She insists on doing
the homework every night.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.471
The dialog sessions, the love letters.

15:47.931 --> 15:50.934
She wants to become
a group leader in the area.

15:52.769 --> 15:54.145
Very committed.

15:55.397 --> 15:58.733
- Well, that's good.
- But thank you for checking on her.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.861
Yeah. It was good to see you.

16:01.861 --> 16:04.406
Good to see you, too. Alright.

16:55.039 --> 16:56.207
<i>My pleasure.</i>

16:56.207 --> 16:57.834
<i>You're all very special people.</i>

16:57.834 --> 16:59.502
<i>Thank you. We're coming back.</i>

16:59.502 --> 17:01.337
<i>Oh, well, in that case,
I'll double our insurance.</i>

17:08.803 --> 17:11.264
-<i>Thanks for everything</i>.
<i>- Yes. Wonderful.</i>

17:11.264 --> 17:12.390
<i>So long.</i>

17:13.308 --> 17:14.517
<i>Well, what's your prediction?</i>

17:14.517 --> 17:16.019
<i>Oh, definite marriage.</i>

17:16.978 --> 17:18.605
<i>Think they'll have children?</i>

17:18.605 --> 17:20.106
<i>Whether they want to or not.</i>

17:21.775 --> 17:23.067
Hey.

17:24.652 --> 17:25.653
I was watching that.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.073
Yes, I can see
that you were watching that.

17:28.073 --> 17:30.241
I bet you'd love to be a passenger on
<i>The Love Boat,</i>

17:30.241 --> 17:31.576
wouldn't you, Pat?

17:32.702 --> 17:34.370
Well, guess what?
So would I.

17:36.915 --> 17:39.834
I feel like I'm in trouble.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.087
I don't know why.

17:43.087 --> 17:45.089
I wanna go to Marriage Encounter.

17:46.216 --> 17:47.258
What?

17:47.258 --> 17:50.887
It's not just the Garlingtons.
Allan and Betty.

17:50.887 --> 17:53.932
Betty, I mean,
she's just like a whole new person.

17:53.932 --> 17:56.267
It's a cult though, Candy.

17:56.267 --> 17:58.394
It's not a cult!

17:58.978 --> 18:00.480
And even if it is--

18:01.397 --> 18:03.107
Why are we here, Pat?

18:04.108 --> 18:06.528
And I don't mean on the sofa.
I mean

18:07.487 --> 18:08.696
on Earth.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.698
- Yeah.
- Why are we here?

18:14.994 --> 18:16.830
That's a huge question, Candy.

18:16.830 --> 18:19.791
And I'd like an answer.
Your answer.

18:21.417 --> 18:22.836
Well, I mean

18:25.296 --> 18:26.631
why is a tree here?

18:27.674 --> 18:28.550
What?

18:28.550 --> 18:31.845
You know how I hate you answering
my questions with questions.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.972
- Yeah, I have--
- Why is a tree here?

18:33.972 --> 18:36.474
- Seriously?
- Look, Candy.

18:36.474 --> 18:38.685
I'm not going to have this

18:39.269 --> 18:40.687
cosmic grasp

18:40.687 --> 18:43.314
that you're looking for, I think, but

18:44.315 --> 18:47.318
a tree, it grows its roots.

18:47.318 --> 18:49.571
It sprouts fruit.

18:50.738 --> 18:54.159
The fruit spreads its seeds,
and then more trees grow,

18:54.159 --> 18:56.828
and it goes on and on like that.

18:56.828 --> 18:59.747
And I don't think we're much different,
you know?

18:59.747 --> 19:02.667
We grow our roots.
We raise our kids.

19:03.835 --> 19:06.462
I think that's a good reason to be here.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.339
Or anywhere.

19:09.465 --> 19:11.551
Well, what's your answer?

19:11.551 --> 19:13.970
Why are you here?

19:17.724 --> 19:19.142
I don't know.

19:26.441 --> 19:27.859
You know

19:29.736 --> 19:31.070
you always want more.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.949
You do, Candy.
Whatever you have,

19:34.949 --> 19:36.659
- you always want more.
- Yes, I do.

19:36.659 --> 19:38.870
I do want more.

19:38.870 --> 19:40.914
And I'm not gonna apologize for it.

19:40.914 --> 19:44.667
I want more from me.
From you. From us.

19:46.628 --> 19:48.296
You want to go to Marriage Encounter?

19:52.759 --> 19:54.886
Okay. Let's go.

19:59.682 --> 20:05.229
So he has agreed,
and we're gonna just give it a try.

20:05.229 --> 20:08.983
- This is great.
- Well, you know, it's hopeful,

20:08.983 --> 20:12.487
and every day should have a sprinkle
of hope in it, so.

20:12.487 --> 20:15.114
You should put that
in one of your Sunday parables.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.699
"Every day should have
a sprinkle of hope."

20:16.699 --> 20:17.742
That is lovely.

20:17.742 --> 20:19.577
And you know what else?

20:19.577 --> 20:21.412
And this could be the best part of all.

20:21.412 --> 20:23.623
Just that Pat is willing to try,

20:23.623 --> 20:25.416
I don't find myself
thinking of Allan as much.

20:25.416 --> 20:27.585
And when I do,
the first thing that comes to my mind

20:27.585 --> 20:29.629
is that his eyes are too close together.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.631
That's what I've been sayin'.

20:32.382 --> 20:34.842
Here's my new mantra.

20:34.842 --> 20:38.930
It's called, "rediscover me."

20:38.930 --> 20:42.183
With my marriage, with our new business.

20:42.183 --> 20:44.978
And I thought of the perfect name already.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.813
The Covergirls.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.982
- The Covergirls.
- It's what we do, right?

20:48.982 --> 20:52.318
I paint, you wallpaper.
The Covergirls.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.195
I love it.
"We got you covered."

20:54.195 --> 20:55.405
Yes.

20:56.572 --> 21:00.868
And thank you,
Sherry girl, for covering me.

21:08.251 --> 21:10.753
So that's 10 windows, and price per.

21:10.753 --> 21:13.214
Plus saving time on construction, right?

21:19.345 --> 21:23.766
Don Crowder!
Church grounds on a weekday?

21:23.766 --> 21:26.394
My, my, whose wrath
have you doth incurred?

21:26.394 --> 21:29.689
Just my normal pillar
and beacon of the community stuff.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.858
Trying to figure out
some budget challenges.

21:31.858 --> 21:34.527
Yeah, buildings and maintenance.
That's why I'm here.

21:35.445 --> 21:36.446
Let's see.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.324
What's this?

21:40.324 --> 21:43.536
Now, if you're serious about
sprucing up the parsonage,

21:43.536 --> 21:44.871
Sherry Cleckler
and I have started

21:44.871 --> 21:47.457
a new little boutique
home improvement business.

21:47.457 --> 21:48.916
It's mostly paint and polish,

21:48.916 --> 21:50.835
but it's good work at
a price you won't beat.

21:50.835 --> 21:51.878
Thank you.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.130
I'll certainly consider it.

21:54.130 --> 21:56.466
And references upon request.

21:56.466 --> 21:59.052
Well, how would you have references
if you just started?

21:59.052 --> 22:02.055
Why, Ron, I make 'em up.

22:03.347 --> 22:06.184
I'll leave you to your pillaring
and beaconing.

22:10.021 --> 22:12.315
You wanna get in tighter
with the congregation,

22:12.315 --> 22:15.276
straightest line might be
Candy Montgomery.

22:15.276 --> 22:16.778
Folks love her.

22:18.404 --> 22:21.199
Yeah. Meaning they don't love me.

22:21.199 --> 22:24.202
Ron, a little friendly advice.

22:27.705 --> 22:29.165
Here at Lucas,

22:29.165 --> 22:31.375
people just wanna raise their kids,

22:31.375 --> 22:33.002
love their family, love God.

22:33.002 --> 22:35.088
Doesn't call for heavy lifting
on your part.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.131
Just don't be a dick.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.896
Okay.

22:53.397 --> 22:54.816
Is that a moose?

22:57.485 --> 22:59.028
Yep.

22:59.028 --> 23:01.531
- Should we go check in?
- Okay.

23:01.531 --> 23:08.246
When you give yourself,
and I mean give all of yourselves,

23:09.205 --> 23:11.124
I'm gonna make it real simple.

23:12.041 --> 23:13.793
When you give,

23:14.502 --> 23:16.796
you beget.

23:17.839 --> 23:20.258
Let's say it all together, shall we?

23:21.134 --> 23:25.429
When you give, you beget.

23:26.556 --> 23:27.890
Well done.

23:27.890 --> 23:31.853
And look inside.
How does that make you feel?

23:35.648 --> 23:36.649
Pat?

23:40.111 --> 23:41.529
Should I read yours first?

23:42.947 --> 23:44.866
- Okay. Yeah. Yes.
- Okay.

23:46.117 --> 23:49.412
-"When I think of you--"
- Now, I'm a mathematician,

23:50.413 --> 23:53.249
not a writer. So.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.209
Okay.

23:57.378 --> 24:00.798
"When I think of you,
I feel the earth move."

24:02.300 --> 24:04.594
That is so sweet.

24:04.594 --> 24:06.596
"I feel it under my feet."

24:07.555 --> 24:08.806
Pat.

24:09.724 --> 24:12.393
"I feel the sky tumbling down."

24:18.441 --> 24:20.693
Pat, this is a Carole King song.

24:21.611 --> 24:24.405
She's one of your favorites.

24:25.406 --> 24:27.200
Honey, I told you I'm not a writer.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.410
- Oh, my God!
- They're good words.

24:29.410 --> 24:31.245
No, but they're not your words!

24:31.245 --> 24:33.789
Words are not my thing!

24:34.665 --> 24:36.918
I love you more than I could ever express.

24:36.918 --> 24:39.545
More than I could ever write down
in some stupid notebook,

24:39.545 --> 24:42.256
at some stupid cult workshop.

24:45.843 --> 24:47.803
I went with Carole King

24:47.803 --> 24:51.265
because you said
she always wrote close to your heart,

24:51.265 --> 24:53.559
and that's where I wanna be.

24:53.559 --> 24:55.269
Close to your heart.

24:56.812 --> 25:00.024
Why couldn't you have put that down?
That was really beautiful.

25:01.234 --> 25:02.652
It was?

25:04.570 --> 25:05.529
Yes.

25:11.619 --> 25:13.829
I wanna be close to your heart, too.

25:15.456 --> 25:17.667
Why are we here, Candy?

25:18.918 --> 25:22.797
I don't mean on Earth,
I mean at this place,

25:22.797 --> 25:24.298
and

25:25.258 --> 25:26.217
I...

25:27.260 --> 25:29.679
I don't know what you're looking for.

25:31.180 --> 25:33.140
Do you know what you're looking for?

25:36.102 --> 25:39.021
The song "Tapestry" by Carole King.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.150
I've listened to it a zillion times,

25:43.150 --> 25:50.032
and I still have no idea what it's about,
but it speaks to me just the same.

25:51.701 --> 25:56.539
"My life has been a tapestry
of rich and royal hue.

25:57.873 --> 26:01.168
A wondrous woven magic."

26:04.505 --> 26:07.800
Now, I haven't a clue
what she's talkin' about--

26:10.094 --> 26:11.721
but I want it.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.059
Yeah, I want it. I want

26:18.602 --> 26:20.479
my royal hue.

26:23.566 --> 26:24.900
Oh, honey.

26:25.776 --> 26:26.861
Pat.

26:33.117 --> 26:35.911
<i>I'm not saying
that it wasn't a little goofy</i>

26:36.495 --> 26:38.539
but, you know, we did connect.

26:38.539 --> 26:39.999
That's fantastic.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.209
Yeah. And we've fallen off
with the assignments.

26:42.209 --> 26:45.629
There's the daily 10-and-10 and so forth.

26:45.629 --> 26:47.340
What's the daily 10-and-10?

26:47.340 --> 26:50.676
Well, you pick a topic,
and you write about it for 10 minutes,

26:50.676 --> 26:53.804
and then you spend another
10 minutes talking about it.

26:53.804 --> 26:57.266
We did do that for about three days.

26:57.266 --> 27:00.644
But overall, you know,
our sex life has definitely improved.

27:02.313 --> 27:04.648
And I hardly ever think about

27:04.648 --> 27:07.485
you-know-who's perfectly shaped penis.

27:07.485 --> 27:11.030
- Well, this is all very positive.
- Yeah, I think so.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.368
Sorry.

27:17.328 --> 27:20.748
- Hello?
-<i>Candy. Betty Gore.</i>

27:21.540 --> 27:24.377
Betty, hi! How are you?

27:24.377 --> 27:26.045
I'm fine.

27:26.045 --> 27:29.673
And I'm told that you are.
Marriage Encounter went well?

27:30.383 --> 27:32.843
I think it did, yes.

27:32.843 --> 27:34.261
<i>That is so good.</i>

27:34.261 --> 27:37.014
You know I'm the local Flame leader.

27:37.014 --> 27:38.682
<i>I think I heard that.</i>

27:38.682 --> 27:41.185
Yes, that's fantastic.

27:41.185 --> 27:44.105
<i>Yeah. One of my duties</i>

27:44.105 --> 27:46.065
is I host other couples

27:46.065 --> 27:48.234
who have been Encountered and,

27:48.234 --> 27:51.737
well, I would love to have
you and Pat over on Saturday.

27:52.613 --> 27:54.365
She wants me to come to dinner.

27:54.365 --> 27:56.242
No.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.911
And you said yes?

27:58.911 --> 28:01.205
<i>Well, I felt on the spot.</i>

28:01.205 --> 28:03.124
Well, it's this Saturday?

28:03.916 --> 28:05.918
Yep. What are we gonna do?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.004
I guess it'll be fine.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.465
Will it be a problem for you?

28:12.049 --> 28:14.552
I don't know. It might be.

28:16.804 --> 28:19.223
To see you in that context
might be painful and

28:20.349 --> 28:22.810
I don't know.
What if I start wanting you again?

28:27.481 --> 28:32.695
I'm so sorry, Candy. I feel so guilty
for messing up your life like this.

28:32.695 --> 28:35.489
No, no. You didn't. Maybe--

28:36.615 --> 28:39.326
Maybe this is just
the best way for us to move on.

28:40.161 --> 28:41.704
Because Betty and I, we should be friends

28:41.704 --> 28:45.541
and maybe this will be
kinda like a good closure.

28:46.417 --> 28:49.295
Yeah. Good. Okay, good. Good.

28:52.089 --> 28:53.674
It'll be great. I think it'll be fine.

28:54.258 --> 28:57.011
The best part is the capsule
will be reusable.

28:57.011 --> 28:59.513
So, I mean,
you think of all the wasted technology--

28:59.513 --> 29:02.516
- What a waste.
- Such a waste.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.607
- This looks delicious.
- So delicious.

29:09.607 --> 29:12.234
You know, pot roast is my favorite.

29:12.234 --> 29:13.903
Well, I did know.

29:14.528 --> 29:16.655
Allan let the cat out of the bag.

29:20.409 --> 29:22.328
It didn't take you two scientists long

29:22.328 --> 29:24.872
to start talking about
rocket ships and so forth.

29:25.706 --> 29:31.420
No, but actually, we were talking about
something new called the space shuttle.

29:31.420 --> 29:35.424
Which is a capsule
which can be used for repeated travel.

29:35.424 --> 29:38.552
What did you say, Pat?
A couple of years?

29:39.553 --> 29:41.138
1981. Yeah.

29:41.138 --> 29:44.600
Pretty soon,
it'll be easier to go to the moon and Mars

29:44.600 --> 29:46.352
than to get in and out of Dallas.

29:52.149 --> 29:55.611
So, you two enjoyed,
you enjoyed the Encounter.

29:56.946 --> 29:57.738
Yeah.

29:58.155 --> 30:00.074
You been keeping up with your 10-and-10?

30:01.325 --> 30:02.493
Well, we're trying.

30:02.493 --> 30:03.786
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:03.786 --> 30:07.456
Well, that's wonderful.
Isn't that wonderful?

30:07.456 --> 30:09.083
It's wonderful. Yeah.

30:10.459 --> 30:11.627
Yeah.

30:15.714 --> 30:19.260
Candy, I heard about you
and Sherry Cleckler

30:19.260 --> 30:21.262
are talking about a

30:22.638 --> 30:25.975
rediscovering yourself.
A kind of a "rediscover you."

30:25.975 --> 30:28.060
- Wait, did I hear that correctly?
- Yes, you did.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.645
And what does that entail?

30:29.645 --> 30:32.398
Well, Sherry and I are
starting a business together.

30:32.398 --> 30:33.482
Home improvement.

30:36.944 --> 30:39.863
And then, I'm still taking
my writers' workshop classes.

30:40.656 --> 30:43.200
I'm actually moving on
to an advanced level.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.451
That's wonderful.

30:47.663 --> 30:48.831
Some kind of wonderful.

30:52.001 --> 30:53.168
You know

30:54.211 --> 30:57.131
sometimes,
the best way to rediscover yourself is to

30:59.091 --> 31:00.467
look inside you.

31:02.845 --> 31:04.513
Deep inside.

31:05.973 --> 31:08.017
That makes sense.

31:08.017 --> 31:10.019
We all have stuff

31:11.604 --> 31:13.814
buried deep within.

31:15.274 --> 31:16.900
Things we never knew were there.

31:21.530 --> 31:22.615
Yep.

31:28.787 --> 31:29.997
Wonderful.

31:34.209 --> 31:37.254
My God, you must have been dyin' inside!

31:37.254 --> 31:40.090
- A little, but mostly, I was just bored.
- Bored?

31:40.090 --> 31:43.636
At a couples dinner with your lover,
his wife, and your husband?

31:43.636 --> 31:45.721
He is not my lover anymore.

31:45.721 --> 31:49.475
And you know what?
The best part is I was bored with him.

31:49.475 --> 31:50.893
Allan.

31:50.893 --> 31:54.647
I thought that it would be hard to see him
or that old feelings would bubble up,

31:54.647 --> 31:57.024
but nothin'. It's over.

31:57.024 --> 31:59.985
And Betty, love her to death,
but she's a little weird.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.112
You're just now figurin' that out?

32:02.112 --> 32:05.240
But she's also nice.
You know, she's odd because she's odd,

32:05.240 --> 32:08.452
not because she's mean
or unkind or uncaring.

32:08.452 --> 32:10.496
And I'll tell you somethin' else.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.998
I think she's way more interesting
than Allan.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.793
Why does she have to go to some lake
to study the Bible?

32:15.793 --> 32:18.587
- She could just study it here.
- Yep.

32:18.587 --> 32:20.589
Yeah, we have a lot of Bibles.

32:22.007 --> 32:24.927
Maybe she's really going fishing.

32:25.969 --> 32:26.845
Nope.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.722
No, she's definitely studying.

32:28.722 --> 32:31.975
Your mother is taking some special time

32:31.975 --> 32:35.396
to further her commitment to our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

32:36.313 --> 32:37.981
And I'm very proud of her.

32:37.981 --> 32:39.817
I think you guys
should be proud of her, too.

32:39.817 --> 32:41.443
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:41.443 --> 32:42.695
Okay.

32:43.445 --> 32:45.322
It's time for us to pray, right?

32:45.322 --> 32:48.409
- Can we talk after?
- Yeah. Yeah, you can talk after.

32:49.451 --> 32:53.664
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

32:53.664 --> 32:58.043
And if I die before I wake,
I pray to God my soul to take.

34:59.748 --> 35:01.208
- Hey, Pat.
- Hey.

35:01.208 --> 35:02.793
Can I talk to you for a sec?

35:02.793 --> 35:04.253
It's important.

35:04.253 --> 35:05.504
Sure.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.465
You can just let that dry.

35:08.465 --> 35:11.218
- Hey. Yeah. Sorry.
- Hi. It's okay.

35:11.844 --> 35:13.011
Alright.

35:20.394 --> 35:21.353
So

35:22.855 --> 35:27.985
I found a love letter
from Allan Gore to Candy.

35:28.902 --> 35:32.865
I was looking for a letter
she'd written me just after we married

35:32.865 --> 35:36.076
and found a different letter.

35:37.911 --> 35:40.372
I need to know something.
I know she would tell you.

35:42.207 --> 35:43.250
Is it over?

35:45.335 --> 35:47.963
- Pat--
- Is it over?

35:54.595 --> 35:55.888
It is.

35:56.972 --> 35:58.348
And it won't happen again.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.310
It was just a brief thing and, honestly,

36:01.310 --> 36:03.312
it was more friendship than anything.

36:04.354 --> 36:06.356
It was just a stage
that Candy went through.

36:06.356 --> 36:08.233
We were just over at their house
not long ago.

36:09.484 --> 36:12.237
- The Gores, all four of us--
- She told me, and you know what she said?

36:12.237 --> 36:15.490
She said the best part about that night
was that she felt nothin' for Allan.

36:15.490 --> 36:17.034
That it's over-over.

36:19.411 --> 36:20.579
Pat.

36:21.496 --> 36:22.831
She really loves you.

36:25.417 --> 36:29.171
Candy is a good mother,
and she's a good wife,

36:29.171 --> 36:30.964
and she is a good friend to you.

36:30.964 --> 36:33.300
She just made a mistake.

36:33.300 --> 36:37.262
And it was just a brief thing
and it didn't mean anything.

36:40.349 --> 36:42.392
And it's totally over?

36:42.392 --> 36:45.771
It's been over for a long time.

36:49.024 --> 36:52.861
I wanna talk to Candy about this
in my own way.

36:53.487 --> 36:56.239
I don't want you to tell her
that I talked to you.

36:57.282 --> 37:00.202
- Promise me I can talk to her first.
- I promise.

37:01.078 --> 37:02.788
I promise.

37:37.948 --> 37:39.741
- Mommy!
- Hey.

37:39.741 --> 37:42.411
- Hey, baby! Hi!
- Hey, Mom!

37:42.953 --> 37:46.164
Hi! Oh, my gosh, you grew!

37:46.164 --> 37:49.334
I thought we had a deal.
No growing when I'm gone.

37:54.006 --> 37:55.424
- Hey! Hi!
- Hey, Mom.

37:55.424 --> 37:57.259
- Good trip?
- Oh, yeah.

37:58.135 --> 37:59.177
Yeah, we learned so much.

38:00.387 --> 38:03.015
I better not be hearing that you grew,
too, young lady.

38:03.807 --> 38:04.891
Hello?

38:04.891 --> 38:06.351
<i>It's me.</i>

38:06.351 --> 38:09.354
<i>- Don't change your expression.</i>
- What?

38:11.940 --> 38:13.984
Pat found Allan's letter.

38:15.986 --> 38:16.862
What?

38:17.738 --> 38:20.949
<i>He found one of Allan's love letters,
and he came by the salon this morning</i>

38:20.949 --> 38:23.076
<i>to make sure
that the affair's really over.</i>

38:23.076 --> 38:25.746
<i>And he made me promise
not to tell you that he knows.</i>

38:25.746 --> 38:28.999
So, this is me
not telling you that he knows.

38:31.084 --> 38:33.295
Well, I'll call you later, okay?

38:33.295 --> 38:36.048
-<i>Okay. I'm so sorry.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

38:51.855 --> 38:53.815
Everything alright?

38:53.815 --> 38:56.234
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, it's good.

38:57.069 --> 38:59.488
I think I should start fixin' dinner.

39:00.322 --> 39:04.242
And since I have been gone,
it is kids' choice.

39:04.242 --> 39:06.495
- Chef Boyardee!
- Chef Boyardee!

39:06.495 --> 39:08.371
That is my best work.
Straight out of a can.

39:09.706 --> 39:11.875
Raise your hand if you love
Chef Boyardee's.

39:11.875 --> 39:12.918
I do.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.879
Chef Boiardi is the French version
of Chef Boyardee.

39:18.381 --> 39:21.384
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

39:25.722 --> 39:28.725
<i>Now, Travis, let him tell his story
the way he wants to.</i>

39:28.725 --> 39:31.978
<i>But, Mama, I just seen that old yeller dog
catch this fish!</i>

39:31.978 --> 39:34.940
<i>Arliss is just a little boy
with a big imagination.</i>

39:34.940 --> 39:36.316
<i>Won't hurt him to let him use it.</i>

39:38.193 --> 39:40.445
<i>We keep that old yeller dog much longer,</i>

39:40.445 --> 39:42.405
<i>it's gonna make Arliss
the biggest liar in Texas!</i>

40:42.507 --> 40:44.426
I know I failed you.

40:48.972 --> 40:51.892
I tried to write down
how I feel in a letter.

40:54.978 --> 40:56.897
I'm gonna go downstairs while you read it.

40:59.149 --> 41:01.568
Come down whenever you feel like it.

41:25.592 --> 41:27.260
<i>- Take it, Tom!
- No.</i>

41:37.938 --> 41:40.815
<i>...it just stands right up.
It's American--</i>

41:40.815 --> 41:42.817
<i>I agree, agree! It felt--</i>

41:54.788 --> 41:57.207
<i>You read the book? Right?
Did you read the book?</i>

41:57.207 --> 41:58.166
<i>Yes, I read the book.</i>

41:58.166 --> 41:59.918
<i>Okay, then you read
the Folk Singers' Credo.</i>

42:34.411 --> 42:36.329
I am so ashamed.

42:40.959 --> 42:43.295
I don't ever wanna hurt you or the kids.

42:44.546 --> 42:45.839
I know.

42:47.799 --> 42:52.304
Maybe we could get away together.
South Padre Island for a bit.

42:53.555 --> 42:56.474
Just you and me.
Could make it like a

42:58.685 --> 43:00.478
second honeymoon.

43:03.398 --> 43:04.816
That would be nice.

44:26.940 --> 44:32.028
I trust you'll agree that the added
expenditure is well worth it.

44:32.028 --> 44:35.115
They really are the most beautiful
rose-colored cushions I've ever seen, Ron.

44:35.115 --> 44:37.659
They really do make a wonderful statement.

44:37.659 --> 44:39.953
We'll have the best pews in the county.

44:39.953 --> 44:42.539
Now, if we could just find
some folks to fill 'em.

44:46.626 --> 44:49.254
Maybe we should just invite
Jackie Ponder back

44:49.254 --> 44:50.922
to give a guest sermon.

44:50.922 --> 44:52.507
That would fill the seats, wouldn't it?

44:53.174 --> 44:55.635
I think you're being a little sensitive, Ron.

44:55.635 --> 44:58.179
No! I'm not.

45:03.143 --> 45:06.229
He's feeling sensitive
about the attrition.

45:06.229 --> 45:09.524
Maybe if we can get the Gores back,
and the Garlingtons.

45:09.524 --> 45:12.026
Y'all are friends with the Gores, right?

45:12.735 --> 45:16.322
No, not so much. No.
Just our kids play together.

45:16.322 --> 45:18.575
You and Allan
are in the same line of work.

45:20.743 --> 45:23.413
We don't need the Gores.

45:54.194 --> 45:56.362
<i>Pryor remained in critical
but stable condition today</i>

45:56.362 --> 45:58.531
<i>at the Sherman Oaks Community Hospital
in California.</i>

45:59.324 --> 46:01.159
<i>Pryor continues his steady improvement.</i>

46:01.159 --> 46:05.038
<i>Surgery to remove scorched dead skin
could begin next Tuesday,</i>

46:05.038 --> 46:07.207
<i>with skin grafting
starting three or four days later.</i>

46:07.207 --> 46:09.751
Honestly, Pat, can we not have that on?

46:09.751 --> 46:12.795
- He was doing drugs, they say. Cocaine.
- Well, even so,

46:12.795 --> 46:14.255
this is a day of celebration.

46:14.255 --> 46:19.427
We shouldn't be hearin' talk of comedians
lightin' themselves on fire.

46:19.427 --> 46:21.513
Dad, did you take my elephant puppet?

46:22.138 --> 46:24.474
- Why would I do that?
- He's missing.

46:24.474 --> 46:27.268
And Noah's ark has to have an elephant.

46:27.268 --> 46:30.772
We'll find him, honey.
Now, can you please just eat your cereal?

46:30.772 --> 46:34.484
And a cleaner shirt will be nice.
Could somebody call the girls?

46:35.068 --> 46:37.862
- Why are you using that voice?
- What voice?

46:37.862 --> 46:39.572
Your stressed voice.

46:39.572 --> 46:41.241
This is my zillion-things-to-do voice.

46:41.241 --> 46:42.867
We have Bible camp graduation,

46:42.867 --> 46:44.619
I have to do my parable,
we have the puppet show,

46:44.619 --> 46:48.122
and then I have five different errands
to run in five different towns.

46:48.122 --> 46:49.374
Hey! No, you don't.

46:50.333 --> 46:51.709
- Three Trees?
- What?

46:51.709 --> 46:53.378
Your parable.
Are you going with Three Trees?

46:53.378 --> 46:55.672
Well, yeah.
Do you think I shouldn't?

46:56.214 --> 46:57.924
No, well, it's my favorite.

46:57.924 --> 46:59.676
Kids'll love it.

46:59.676 --> 47:03.054
Mom, can Alisa go to the movies
with us tonight?

47:04.222 --> 47:06.266
I don't know, honey.
Alisa's mom didn't like it

47:06.266 --> 47:08.560
when we took her to see "Grease."

47:08.560 --> 47:12.272
But she loves "Star Wars."
She wouldn't mind.

47:12.272 --> 47:13.982
She would want me to go.

47:14.482 --> 47:15.733
Oh, sweetheart.

47:15.733 --> 47:17.986
Now, that was just
the most adorable little fib,

47:17.986 --> 47:20.863
but if it is okay with your mom,

47:20.863 --> 47:22.865
we would love to have you.

47:22.865 --> 47:25.326
Pat, are you sure you can't make
the puppet show?

47:25.326 --> 47:28.746
'Cause I saw the rehearsal
and it's gonna be great.

47:29.289 --> 47:31.040
- I wish.
- Okay.

47:34.294 --> 47:37.547
Doesn't that serve you perfectly right?

47:41.884 --> 47:43.970
You can't come back here first?

47:43.970 --> 47:48.891
My flight's at 4:00, honey.
So, with Friday traffic,

47:49.726 --> 47:51.894
I think I probably need to leave
for the airport.

47:51.894 --> 47:54.897
Best to just go straight from the office.

47:57.108 --> 47:59.819
- Just two days, honey. Two days.
- Yes.

47:59.819 --> 48:02.822
Two days can go more quickly
for some than for others.

48:07.869 --> 48:10.288
Then, I'm home, and

48:11.581 --> 48:15.335
we're packing for Switzerland
and we're going to have the best time.

48:19.922 --> 48:22.300
I'm almost two weeks late.

48:26.387 --> 48:28.765
I can't take care of another baby.
I'll break.

48:32.101 --> 48:35.563
- I don't wanna be pregnant again.
- Honey, there's no reason to start--

48:35.563 --> 48:36.939
No, please don't--

48:37.982 --> 48:40.610
Do not handle me. I beg you. Just...

48:43.071 --> 48:44.405
be with me.

48:45.490 --> 48:47.909
Honey, I am. I am with you.

48:49.535 --> 48:50.953
If you are,

48:52.413 --> 48:53.706
we'll deal with it.

48:53.706 --> 48:55.333
We can deal with anything.

48:55.333 --> 48:57.126
Right? We can.

48:58.878 --> 49:00.254
We can.

49:17.397 --> 49:19.440
You wanna say bye?

49:21.317 --> 49:24.445
Bye, Dada. Bye, Daddy. Bye.

49:26.322 --> 49:28.116
Bye, Dada.

49:36.040 --> 49:39.794
<i>"Once upon a time,
there were three trees high up on a hill.</i>

49:40.586 --> 49:43.172
<i>"The biggest tree
used to say to the others,</i>

49:43.172 --> 49:47.719
"'When I grow up,
I want to be made into a big boat.

49:47.719 --> 49:51.848
"The finest ocean liner in the world.'

49:51.848 --> 49:53.391
"But, one day, a group of wood cutters

49:53.391 --> 49:56.185
"came to the hill of the three trees.

49:56.185 --> 49:59.772
"And one of them looked
at the biggest tree and said,

49:59.772 --> 50:03.568
"'This tree looks like it would make
a fine fishing boat.'

50:03.568 --> 50:06.612
"And the big tree cried and cried,

50:06.612 --> 50:08.656
"but the wood cutters cut it down anyway,

50:08.656 --> 50:10.616
"and it became the very boat

50:10.616 --> 50:14.495
that Peter used as his altar
to spread the good news."

50:15.037 --> 50:16.539
Isn't this a wonderful time we're having?

50:16.539 --> 50:18.958
- Yeah!
- Yes?

50:44.108 --> 50:46.736
Hey, Barbara. Let me help you.
I can get the Kool-Aid.

50:47.779 --> 50:49.614
It is gonna be a scorcher today.

50:49.614 --> 50:52.992
Oh, my God,
I just wanna drop and put my feet up.

50:52.992 --> 50:55.745
- Do you ever do that, Candy?
- Well, it won't be today.

50:55.745 --> 50:58.331
The kids all wanna see
the new "Star Wars."

50:58.331 --> 51:00.750
And Jenny wants Alisa
to stay over another night,

51:00.750 --> 51:03.920
which is fine,
but Alisa has her swim lesson today,

51:03.920 --> 51:05.671
so that means I have to drive
all the way to Wylie

51:05.671 --> 51:08.257
to pick up her swimsuit.

51:08.257 --> 51:11.803
I suppose if I do leave soon enough,
then I can swing by the Target

51:11.803 --> 51:14.722
- to get a Father's Day card for Pat.
- Oh my-- Go.

51:14.722 --> 51:17.058
Go. I can do this.

51:17.058 --> 51:18.142
And you better get a move on

51:18.142 --> 51:19.352
if you're gonna make it back
in time for the puppet show.

51:19.352 --> 51:20.770
And I can't miss that.

51:20.770 --> 51:22.772
- Ian made the elephant.
- Bail.

51:24.065 --> 51:26.609
- Hey. Listen to Miss Barbara, okay?
- Okay. Bye, Mom.

51:30.363 --> 51:31.239
Hi!

51:31.239 --> 51:32.657
Hi.

51:37.411 --> 51:40.331
Candy!
I finished with your cassette recorder.

51:40.998 --> 51:42.166
Okay, well, I'll be right back.

51:42.166 --> 51:44.252
I just need to run over to
Betty Gore's and then to Target.

51:44.252 --> 51:45.670
Gotcha. Bye.

51:45.670 --> 51:47.171
Yeah. See you.

52:47.231 --> 52:48.107
Candy.

52:48.107 --> 52:50.401
Sorry. Why call when you can
barge right in, right?

52:51.068 --> 52:52.528
I hope I didn't disturb.

52:52.528 --> 52:55.573
No. No, no, no.
No, I just put the--

52:55.573 --> 52:57.783
put the baby down
and then poured myself a cup of coffee,

52:57.783 --> 53:01.162
getting ready to watch
a little "Phil Donahue."

53:01.162 --> 53:03.164
Sounds like heaven.

53:03.164 --> 53:05.166
- Come in. Join me.
- Okay.

53:06.250 --> 53:07.793
Well, I can't stay long.

53:07.793 --> 53:10.338
Noah's ark is leaving port
within the hour.

53:10.338 --> 53:12.673
But the reason I came is
we're seeing "Star Wars" tonight,

53:12.673 --> 53:14.675
and Alisa wants to come,

53:14.675 --> 53:17.178
and Jenny's just
desperate for her to join.

53:17.178 --> 53:19.889
And I said it was okay with me
if it was okay with you.

53:19.889 --> 53:22.058
Which is to mean
her spending another night.

53:22.892 --> 53:26.187
And I'm happy to take her
to her swim lesson to save you the trip.

53:27.229 --> 53:30.191
No, sure.
That's fine with me.

53:30.191 --> 53:31.901
Well, I thought it would be,

53:31.901 --> 53:34.904
so I just came from Bible school
to pick up her suit.

53:34.904 --> 53:36.906
- You sure you can't stay for coffee?
- No, no. Thank you.

53:38.783 --> 53:41.953
Remember, she doesn't like to
put her face underwater. Alisa.

53:41.953 --> 53:43.329
So, if she does put her face underwater,

53:43.329 --> 53:44.830
be sure to give her
peppermints afterwards.

53:44.830 --> 53:47.041
That's the reward that we have.

53:47.500 --> 53:49.669
- Okay!
- Okay.

53:51.212 --> 53:53.714
I'm just so busy
getting ready for our trip.

53:54.423 --> 53:57.343
- Switzerland! I heard!
- Kansas first.

53:57.343 --> 53:59.720
We're gonna drop the kids and the dogs off
at my parents.

54:00.304 --> 54:01.764
- Dogs?
- Yes.

54:01.764 --> 54:03.516
We got another one.
A puppy, six months old.

54:03.516 --> 54:05.643
He's right out there.

54:05.643 --> 54:08.896
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

54:08.896 --> 54:11.983
What is his name?

54:11.983 --> 54:14.568
- Cheeto.
- Cheeto!

54:14.568 --> 54:17.488
Oh, my gosh.
Your name is Cheeto. Hi.

54:17.488 --> 54:19.490
Alisa can't bear to leave him alone.

54:19.490 --> 54:24.078
Well, I can see why.
You're just the sweetest little boy!

54:24.620 --> 54:27.415
You're a good boy! Yes, you are!

54:27.415 --> 54:29.333
Come, come.
Just sit for a second.

54:30.543 --> 54:31.585
Okay.

54:32.586 --> 54:35.339
- Okay, outside. Outside. Good job.
- Oh, my goodness.

54:47.476 --> 54:49.395
- Nothing?
- No. Thanks.

54:50.730 --> 54:51.731
Well.

55:00.740 --> 55:02.408
Gonna be a scorcher today.

55:02.408 --> 55:04.410
Scorcher.

55:06.162 --> 55:09.206
I almost forgot.
Sherry and I actually incorporated.

55:09.206 --> 55:10.958
We're lining jobs up for the fall,

55:10.958 --> 55:16.005
so if you need any papering
or painting done, here is our card.

55:16.005 --> 55:17.798
The Covergirls.

55:19.133 --> 55:21.427
- It's cute.
- It's so exciting.

55:22.636 --> 55:24.013
Well, I should probably get goin'.

55:24.013 --> 55:28.768
I'm hopin' to swing by Target
and get a Father's Day card for Pat,

55:28.768 --> 55:30.811
so should I just go grab Alisa's suit or--

55:30.811 --> 55:31.729
Candy.

55:34.482 --> 55:36.358
Are you having an affair with Allan?

55:37.026 --> 55:38.194
No.

55:38.944 --> 55:41.322
No, of course not.

55:43.365 --> 55:44.784
But you did.

55:47.119 --> 55:48.120
Didn't you?

55:52.083 --> 55:53.250
Didn't you?

55:57.838 --> 55:59.256
Yes.

56:01.801 --> 56:04.220
But it was a long time ago.

56:11.560 --> 56:13.813
Did Allan tell you?

56:20.945 --> 56:22.363
Can you wait a minute?

57:05.823 --> 57:07.032
Betty?

57:11.912 --> 57:13.330
Betty.
