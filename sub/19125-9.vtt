02:30.726 --> 02:33.652
Until now, you've been competing

02:33.837 --> 02:37.281
This week, each team
will combine with another team

02:37.474 --> 02:41.410

02:41.519 --> 02:43.912

02:44.022 --> 02:45.166
I know this is
a little different,

02:45.190 --> 02:46.915

<i>this challenge is gonna be.</i>

02:53.698 --> 02:55.090
[chuckles]

02:55.200 --> 02:57.718
Okay, we're gonna let
you choose which team

02:57.903 --> 03:00.263
you want to pair up with, so go
ahead and do that right now.

03:03.091 --> 03:04.766

- Yep.
- Going down.

03:09.932 --> 03:11.685
All right, now that we have
our new super teams,

03:11.709 --> 03:15.444
let's get into your next
Spotlight Challenge.

03:15.553 --> 03:17.404
In classic horror films like...

03:17.589 --> 03:19.531
- Yes!
- So excited.

03:19.717 --> 03:21.569
Okay, well let me at least
give you a couple of examples.

03:21.593 --> 03:22.743
- Sure.
- So in films like

03:24.112 --> 03:25.573
<i>"The Hills Have Eyes,"
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"</i>

03:25.597 --> 03:27.414
<i>and "House of 1000 Corpses,"</i>

03:27.599 --> 03:30.292
lost travelers stop
and ask for directions

03:30.452 --> 03:32.878
at remote gas stations
just like this one.

03:33.063 --> 03:34.963
Unfortunately,
the creepy attendants

03:35.073 --> 03:37.549
give them false directions
that lead them astray,

03:37.735 --> 03:40.469
allowing some sort of mutated
or deranged family member

03:40.578 --> 03:41.845
to pick them off one by one.

03:42.038 --> 03:44.056
Oh, my gosh, stop.

03:44.241 --> 03:45.521
So in this Spotlight Challenge,

03:45.583 --> 03:47.059
each super team will create

03:47.244 --> 03:50.520
a sadistic family
of three deranged mutants.

03:50.714 --> 03:51.714
- Dude!
- Yes!

03:51.790 --> 03:54.066
- Yes, yes!
- Oh, my God.

03:54.251 --> 03:55.651
You're giving me wiggle fingers.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.653
Finally, we've done all
this pretty [bleep],

03:57.762 --> 04:01.073
<i>and now we get to do something
scary and bloody and snotty,</i>

04:01.258 --> 04:02.574
which is so awesome.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.493
Let's go. Let's go right now.

04:04.653 --> 04:06.464
Now I do want you to have
a little inspiration

04:06.488 --> 04:09.373
when you create your family,
so next to me are two maps,

04:09.566 --> 04:11.917
<i>each leading to a different
nearby location</i>

04:12.102 --> 04:13.335
<i>where your family might live.</i>

04:13.445 --> 04:15.671
Super team two, you're up first.

04:15.780 --> 04:16.922
Come choose a map.

04:17.107 --> 04:18.798
- Can I pick it?
- We elect you.

04:18.983 --> 04:20.841
- What do you guys want?
- I'll get it.

04:23.672 --> 04:24.672
[laughter]

04:24.782 --> 04:26.150
We're already getting along
great.

04:26.174 --> 04:27.432
[laughter]

04:27.618 --> 04:28.769
I like the one
with all the signs.

04:28.793 --> 04:30.644
- Adam, pick one, man.
- They're the same.

04:30.829 --> 04:32.020
No... the one... the signs.

04:32.180 --> 04:34.022
- You want the signs?
- Yeah, 'cause it says...

04:34.182 --> 04:35.357
[laughter]

04:35.467 --> 04:37.567
What?

04:37.761 --> 04:39.121
That's a team leader
right there.

04:39.187 --> 04:40.654
Teamwork.

04:40.839 --> 04:43.031
All right, super team one,
please come take your map.

04:43.191 --> 04:44.491
- Can I pick it?
- Go for it.

04:44.676 --> 04:45.492
- Yeah, get it.
- Oh, thank you guys.

04:45.677 --> 04:46.837
- Appreciate it.
- Absolutely.

04:46.970 --> 04:49.955
George, that's gonna be
a wonderful choice.

04:50.140 --> 04:52.040
- Great choice.
- Oh, you guys are the best.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.500
- You're the best.
- Aww.

04:53.685 --> 04:55.627
- You're the best.
- All right, guys,

04:55.813 --> 04:58.338
because there are four of you
working together,

04:58.524 --> 05:02.050
you will only have two days
to complete your characters.

05:02.210 --> 05:04.678
So please use your time wisely.

05:04.863 --> 05:08.015
Before you go,
I have one more big piece

05:08.200 --> 05:10.934
of information to share.

05:11.127 --> 05:15.314
From this point forward,
there will be no more immunity,

05:15.499 --> 05:19.443
and we will be eliminating
individuals instead of teams.

05:19.636 --> 05:20.636
Wow.

05:20.729 --> 05:22.821
<i>Oh, my gosh. This is crazy.</i>

05:23.006 --> 05:24.286
We don't want anybody
going home,

05:24.399 --> 05:26.825
especially when you've built
such a great relationship

05:27.010 --> 05:30.829
with your teammate, but now
it's really anyone's game.

05:31.014 --> 05:33.040
All right, guys,
it's time to follow your maps

05:33.225 --> 05:34.708
and get started on your designs.

05:34.893 --> 05:36.204
Can't wait to see
your deranged families.

05:36.228 --> 05:38.003
- Yeah.
- Bye.

05:40.156 --> 05:42.924
- Where are we going, Logan?
- Well, hold on a second.

05:43.034 --> 05:44.051
Take out this map here.

05:44.236 --> 05:46.428
How do you operate
one of these things?

05:46.588 --> 05:48.055
It's right. I don't get where-

05:48.240 --> 05:50.766
- If you don't get this...
- All right.

05:50.926 --> 05:54.311
All right, bye, guys.

05:54.504 --> 05:58.065
So Logan's leading the way,
and I look over,

05:58.250 --> 06:01.318
and I see the place
that we would have had

06:01.511 --> 06:03.278
was a [bleep] circus.

06:05.348 --> 06:07.491
- No.
- Okay.

06:07.684 --> 06:09.785
All right, so who's got an idea?

06:09.945 --> 06:12.996
<i>We end up at
a abandoned military base.</i>

06:13.189 --> 06:14.748
There's bombs everywhere.

06:14.933 --> 06:17.000
<i>There's these barrels of poison.</i>

06:17.193 --> 06:19.294
<i>It literally looks like
a testing facility</i>

06:19.454 --> 06:20.670
that just went haywire.

06:20.864 --> 06:23.632
The first thing I thought of
was nuclear testing.

06:23.741 --> 06:25.467
- Yep, yep.
- One character could be

06:25.627 --> 06:28.011
blazoned on one side from the
flash of a nuclear explosion.

06:28.204 --> 06:29.346
- Okay.
- Burned.

06:29.539 --> 06:31.092
Now what do they do?
I personally think

06:31.116 --> 06:32.184
we should have a little girl.

06:32.208 --> 06:33.968
I feel like she should be
the one that lures.

06:34.043 --> 06:35.852
They are a family
that take others.

06:36.045 --> 06:37.056
- Right, a family dri...
- You feel like you have

06:37.080 --> 06:39.022
a sympathy factor for her. Yes.

06:39.215 --> 06:40.357
- Plus, a lost child.
- Yeah.

06:40.550 --> 06:41.670
- A lost child factor.
- Yep.

06:41.759 --> 06:44.528
So we come up with the idea
that our military family

06:44.721 --> 06:46.613
is broken up between
a little girl

06:46.798 --> 06:47.989
and her mother and father.

06:48.099 --> 06:51.576
<i>We want them to be set
in the '40s-type era,</i>

06:51.762 --> 06:55.038
<i>And they fall victim
to being tested on</i>

06:55.231 --> 06:56.665
and it just went totally wrong.

06:56.774 --> 06:58.419
Well, like you just said,
to keep it practical,

06:58.443 --> 06:59.723
why couldn't you do something...

06:59.777 --> 07:01.962
I've done a lot of things
with the teeth,

07:02.147 --> 07:04.005
or you can pull a lip up
and keep it there.

07:04.115 --> 07:06.007
Absolutely. Something like this

07:06.117 --> 07:08.095
in this particular challenge.
I always wanted to do that.

07:08.119 --> 07:09.636
That's definitely
a good way to go.

07:09.821 --> 07:13.348
We have a concept,
but I'm not as excited about it

07:13.508 --> 07:14.975
<i>as the rest of the team.</i>

07:15.160 --> 07:16.685
<i>I don't want to go
against the grain,</i>

07:16.794 --> 07:19.020
<i>so I'm just hoping that things
will come together</i>

07:19.130 --> 07:21.231
<i>once we start to sculpt.</i>

07:21.424 --> 07:22.941
- Festering, just...
- Yes.

07:23.126 --> 07:25.112
There's more black in the
paint job than there is reds.

07:25.136 --> 07:27.737
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

07:27.931 --> 07:30.407
- [grunting]
- Oh, my gosh.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.826
We end up at
an abandoned circus.

07:33.011 --> 07:36.037
<i>There's dumbbells, a big mallet,</i>

07:36.147 --> 07:38.498
<i>and a big cage,
so that gives us a lot of ideas</i>

07:38.684 --> 07:40.917
for kind of
a freak show-type family.

07:41.110 --> 07:42.755
Obviously we have to do
something circus-themed.

07:42.779 --> 07:44.546
It could be any freak.
Could be any freak.

07:44.706 --> 07:46.506
Could we make him hydrocephalic?

07:46.692 --> 07:48.049
A water head baby.

07:48.159 --> 07:49.801
Ooh, if he was in a wheelchair.

07:49.987 --> 07:51.839
Oh, yeah, I wanted to do...
I was gonna say a wheelchair.

07:51.863 --> 07:53.722
- Like "The Hills Have Eyes."
- Yeah.

07:53.831 --> 07:56.892
So our concept for our family
is the "Ma" character

07:57.001 --> 07:58.121
<i>used to be the strongwoman,</i>

07:58.161 --> 08:00.437
<i>and the father,
humanzee organ grinder,</i>

08:00.630 --> 08:04.941
<i>kidnap people and force them
to perform for their son,</i>

08:05.134 --> 08:06.693
<i>the creepy ringmaster,</i>

08:06.878 --> 08:07.981
before they kill them
and eat them.

08:08.005 --> 08:10.822
Come to my playground, kiddies.

08:11.008 --> 08:12.365
[laughter] <i>- I'm feeling great.</i>

08:12.551 --> 08:13.825
<i>We have a super solid concept.</i>

08:14.011 --> 08:15.655
All the characters
work really well together.

08:15.679 --> 08:17.329
And it's super scary,

08:17.514 --> 08:18.700
which is the whole point
of a horror challenge.

08:18.724 --> 08:19.539
All right, let's get back
to the lab.

08:19.725 --> 08:20.540
- Let's go back.
- Okay.

08:20.726 --> 08:21.726
- Let's do it.
- Cool.

08:21.852 --> 08:22.667
All right, you guys,
let's go back.

08:22.853 --> 08:23.668
- All right.
- Yeah.

08:23.854 --> 08:25.295
- Oh, you got the map wet!
- Aww.

08:25.488 --> 08:26.666
- Now we'll never get back.
- We don't know where

08:26.690 --> 08:28.340
- we're going.
- Hi, guys.

08:28.525 --> 08:29.883

Its directionality from the tip

30:13.495 --> 30:15.354
is absolutely perfect.

This, to me, is some

Good job.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.603
My favorite thing
about this makeup

30:56.763 --> 31:00.649
is that actually looks like
the eyes are slightly askew,

31:00.842 --> 31:02.987
even though they're not because
it's the performer's real eyes.

31:03.011 --> 31:04.820
So they've used color
to create form,

31:05.013 --> 31:06.066

- Very well.
- That's fantastic.

31:13.021 --> 31:15.330
Awesome.

31:15.523 --> 31:16.876
I love the fact that
they mixed it up

31:16.900 --> 31:18.292
and put the guy in the dress

31:18.401 --> 31:20.669
and put the chick
in the father's clothes.

31:20.862 --> 31:22.212
That's pretty great.

31:22.398 --> 31:24.715
I love the restraint shown
on the prosthetics.

31:24.900 --> 31:26.711

with just little things

31:26.735 --> 31:28.468
like the hair and the dress.

come to life.

That's what interests me now
with the rationale behind this,

31:33.541 --> 31:35.976
you know, is it like some toxic
thing that happened to them,

31:36.136 --> 31:38.937

because there are two teams,

33:26.913 --> 33:30.507

33:30.692 --> 33:34.594
There's an eloquent restraint

33:34.755 --> 33:36.555
<i>Which is creepy
right out of the gate.</i>

33:36.740 --> 33:38.142
We had originally designed
these characters

<i>we make Chase the little girl.</i>

33:48.602 --> 33:50.902
<i>That decision made
the daughter character better,</i>

33:51.088 --> 33:54.239

from the father figure.

They are so fricking creepy,
every single one of 'em.

the daughter is a subtle makeup.

<i>I'm wondering if this is

Is that why she's gray
and powdery?

34:12.125 --> 34:13.300
Yeah, she's still so vain

34:13.460 --> 34:15.802
that she continues to load
the makeup on.

34:15.911 --> 34:18.346
<i>That way we can still see
some of the grotesqueness.</i>

34:18.540 --> 34:20.931
But on her face itself,
it's just caked-on makeup.

34:21.118 --> 34:22.809
I figured there had to be
some reason

34:22.969 --> 34:25.853

flourish of all

- Yes!

37:35.829 --> 37:37.170
All right, judges, so let's talk

37:37.330 --> 37:38.964
about tonight's super teams.

37:39.149 --> 37:41.758
This is a really,
really hard decision, ain't it?

37:41.943 --> 37:44.511
'Cause I loved both teams,
every character.

37:44.620 --> 37:46.680
It's gonna be a tough one.
Where do we begin?

37:46.840 --> 37:49.516
Why don't we start with
Adam, Logan, Emily, and Tyler?

37:49.625 --> 37:53.311
<i>As a family, I thought they
worked extremely well together.</i>

37:53.497 --> 37:56.982
What was interesting was
that split-second choice

37:57.167 --> 38:00.318
to swap the daughter
for the father.

38:00.504 --> 38:02.779
<i>And that was probably
the best decision</i>

38:02.964 --> 38:06.199
<i>because it gave them a subtle
makeup on the daughter</i>

38:06.359 --> 38:08.326
but the strongest silhouette
of them all.

38:08.512 --> 38:10.453
<i>But the father was a bit
anonymous,</i>

38:10.639 --> 38:14.374
<i>both in its sculpture
as well as the disorder.</i>

38:14.484 --> 38:16.001
I think the face was also

38:16.186 --> 38:18.503
a little over-painted for me
and sloppy.

38:18.688 --> 38:20.758
<i>If the paint job would have
been a little bit more subtle,</i>

38:20.782 --> 38:22.794
<i>it probably would have looked
much better as well.</i>

38:22.818 --> 38:26.845
I love the illustrative
pulp-style of the mother makeup.

38:27.030 --> 38:29.848
<i>The teeth and the eyes
make everything else pop,</i>

38:30.033 --> 38:32.559
<i>and it gives it this "Fright
Night" pulp horror look.</i>

38:32.668 --> 38:34.936
She's a fantastic character,
I absolutely agree.

38:35.129 --> 38:36.449
<i>Even down to the pre-made teeth,</i>

38:36.540 --> 38:37.814
<i>which so seldom work well.</i>

38:37.999 --> 38:39.399
<i>It worked really well on her.</i>

38:39.559 --> 38:41.526
But I didn't believe that
they all suffered from

38:41.711 --> 38:44.571
the same disease and from the
same source of disfigurement.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.000
When these teams are this close,

38:46.140 --> 38:47.657
that's a very important point.

38:47.843 --> 38:49.868
Because it comes down
their ability to adhere

38:50.053 --> 38:51.953
to the core
of the challenge parameters.

38:52.146 --> 38:54.466
All right, judges, let's move
on to our other super team,

38:54.649 --> 38:56.791
Cig, George, Evan, and Ben.

38:56.984 --> 38:59.961
<i>The offspring character,
the stretching of the skin.</i>

39:00.154 --> 39:02.213
<i>The weight of the head,</i>

39:02.399 --> 39:04.060
<i>the veining that goes
all the way around it,</i>

39:04.084 --> 39:06.468
so well-sculpted.

39:06.661 --> 39:08.928
<i>That paint job was
absolutely gorgeous.</i>

39:09.038 --> 39:11.681
<i>That's probably the best
example of vein painting</i>

39:11.867 --> 39:13.725
I have seen in 11 seasons.

39:13.910 --> 39:15.145
And you liked
the painted-on mustache, right?

39:15.169 --> 39:15.977
I loved the painted-on mustache.

39:16.170 --> 39:17.570
Because that made it real
somehow.

39:17.672 --> 39:19.352
<i>- Loved it.
- That's what they did, yeah.</i>

39:19.416 --> 39:22.442
The only real complaint is
I can't believe someone

39:22.552 --> 39:24.778
<i>that can sculpt and paint
that silicone face</i>
