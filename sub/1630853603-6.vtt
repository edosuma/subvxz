WEBVTT

00:00.679 --> 00:03.617
(water running)

00:09.496 --> 00:11.199
MICHAEL:
Alright, so you guys wanna
hear the story or what?

00:11.232 --> 00:12.401
-CARMY: Yeah.
-RICHIE: Let's go.

00:12.434 --> 00:13.136
MICHAEL:
Hmm? Hmm?

00:13.169 --> 00:14.305
RICHIE:
Let's go, let's go.

00:14.338 --> 00:15.240
MICHAEL:
Alright, here we go.

00:15.273 --> 00:16.611
Here we go, here we go.

00:16.644 --> 00:17.513
So we're at Ceres, right?

00:17.546 --> 00:19.282
Which was the, the bar
at the bottom of

00:19.315 --> 00:21.252
the Board of Trade
building, right?

00:21.285 --> 00:23.558
Just this little bar
in the lobby, right?

00:23.591 --> 00:26.129
The thing is, the place opened
at like 6:30 in the morning

00:26.162 --> 00:27.733
so that when traders,
when they lost their ass

00:27.766 --> 00:29.002
when the market opened,
they could just,

00:29.035 --> 00:31.674
you know, they could walk over
and just get fuckin' hammered

00:31.707 --> 00:32.809
in this little fucking bar.

00:32.842 --> 00:34.479
Anyway, the name Ceres,

00:34.513 --> 00:36.517
it was named after (burps)

00:36.550 --> 00:37.418
the Goddess of Agriculture.

00:37.451 --> 00:39.355
-Sorry.
-You and your fucking stories.

00:39.388 --> 00:41.326
Someone's jealous they
weren't invited, huh?

00:41.359 --> 00:42.596
(scoffs) I would not have gone.

00:42.629 --> 00:43.698
You would've fuckin' gone.

00:43.731 --> 00:44.800
Hey, Carmy, do some parm.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.202
Yeah, I got you. I got you.

00:46.235 --> 00:47.405
Anyway, on top of the building,

00:47.438 --> 00:50.177
there was like a statue
of Ceres and her back,

00:50.210 --> 00:51.580
for all of you historians,

00:51.613 --> 00:52.783
was facing towards the east.

00:52.816 --> 00:54.687
And that's because
all the trading

00:54.720 --> 00:56.389
had just moved to the Midwest.

00:56.422 --> 00:58.594
So the architect,
John Storrs, legend has it,

00:58.627 --> 01:01.466
he built this statue--
It was like a, It was like
a big "fuck you."

01:01.500 --> 01:03.771
RICHIE:
Christ, wake me up
when the story starts

01:03.804 --> 01:04.840
and the fucking
class is dismissed.

01:04.873 --> 01:06.376
MAN:
He's trying to tell his story.

01:06.409 --> 01:07.713
MICHAEL:
I'm trying to tell
the fucking story.

01:07.746 --> 01:09.282
So anyway--
Just let me add this.

01:09.315 --> 01:11.587
Anyway, so, the point is
we're out all night,

01:11.620 --> 01:14.325
we're drunk as shit,
we're fuckin' high as shit.

01:14.358 --> 01:15.729
We figured the only place
that's still open,

01:15.762 --> 01:17.198
of course, Ceres!

01:17.231 --> 01:18.735
And being 6:45 in the morning,

01:18.768 --> 01:20.304
we are right to assume
that the place

01:20.337 --> 01:22.141
is gonna be a fuckin'
ghost town, right?

01:22.174 --> 01:23.678
-No, no, no. Fuck off.
-Yo, get the fuck outta here

01:23.711 --> 01:24.680
with those raisins.

01:24.713 --> 01:26.149
Mom always added raisins!

01:26.182 --> 01:27.017
We are not fucking
doing raisins.

01:27.051 --> 01:28.888
Anyway, Cousin,
was it a ghost town?

01:28.921 --> 01:29.923
It was not a ghost town.

01:29.956 --> 01:31.661
MICHAEL:
Not only was it
not a ghost town,

01:31.694 --> 01:33.196
it was a fucking rager.

01:33.229 --> 01:34.432
It was fucking packed!

01:34.465 --> 01:36.604
It was just like.
(howls) Right?

01:36.637 --> 01:38.240
All fuckin' Blackhawk fans,

01:38.273 --> 01:39.475
and, Cousin, who was there?

01:39.509 --> 01:40.443
-Savvy.
-Oh!

01:40.477 --> 01:42.883
-Get the fuck outta here!
-Fucking Savvy!

01:42.916 --> 01:45.154
-Denis motherfucking Savard.
-BOTH: Number 18!

01:45.187 --> 01:46.356
In the house!

01:46.389 --> 01:47.425
-SUGAR: Okay.
-MICHAEL: But not only that.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.228
No, no, no.
It does not stop there.

01:49.261 --> 01:52.836
Chelios fuckin' Belfour,
let's go!

01:52.869 --> 01:53.838
-Right?
-SUGAR: Okay, that's cool.

01:53.871 --> 01:55.942
The night before,
Savvy had gotten inducted

01:55.975 --> 01:57.445
into the fuckin'
Hockey Hall of Fame.

01:57.478 --> 02:00.217
We walk into this
giant fuckin' party.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.654
I mean, it's going off, right?

02:01.687 --> 02:02.622
A fucking brouhaha.

02:02.655 --> 02:03.322
And this motherfucker,

02:03.356 --> 02:05.394
he somehow, this curious fellow,

02:05.427 --> 02:06.597
he somehow gets
his hands on--
What was it?

02:06.630 --> 02:09.335
It was like a, It was like
a Ceres pamphlet or some shit?

02:09.368 --> 02:10.772
Yeah, it was behind the bar.

02:10.805 --> 02:12.375
-Right, so he's--
-Behind the bar.

02:12.408 --> 02:13.911
MICHAEL:
He's reading aloud
about the history

02:13.944 --> 02:15.615
of the Goddess of Agriculture,

02:15.648 --> 02:17.686
and somehow in that process
he somehow decides

02:17.719 --> 02:20.792
that he too has this
deep connection to, uh,
to agriculture, right?

02:20.825 --> 02:21.894
So he takes out his phone,

02:21.927 --> 02:23.798
and he starts leaving this
outgoing message, right?

02:23.831 --> 02:25.267
What was the fuckin' message?

02:25.300 --> 02:26.937
"Hi, you have reached
the voicemail

02:26.970 --> 02:28.373
"of Richie Jerimovich,

02:28.406 --> 02:29.977
the Goddess of Agriculture."

02:30.010 --> 02:31.814
-(all laugh)
-(overlapping chatter)

02:31.847 --> 02:32.883
So fuckin' stupid.

02:32.916 --> 02:34.285
That shit is genius!

02:34.318 --> 02:35.421
So the goddess over here,

02:35.454 --> 02:36.624
he's trying to leave
this message,

02:36.657 --> 02:38.260
but he's a puddle,
he keeps fucking up.

02:38.293 --> 02:40.498
It's just getting louder
and louder and louder,

02:40.531 --> 02:41.767
and somehow
with all the cacophony

02:41.800 --> 02:42.836
and all the fuckin' nonsense,

02:42.869 --> 02:44.506
with all the fuckin' hullabaloo,

02:44.539 --> 02:46.510
we hear this fuckin'
voice ring out,

02:46.543 --> 02:49.817
and the voice says,
"What are you doing?"

02:49.850 --> 02:50.919
(laughs)

02:50.952 --> 02:51.987
Right?

02:52.020 --> 02:53.691
And right in front
of us, this guy,

02:53.724 --> 02:56.229
he turns around, who was it?

02:56.262 --> 02:57.732
-Bill Murray! Bill Murray!
-SUGAR: What?

02:57.765 --> 02:59.970
-Of course, it's Bill Murray.
-(all shouting)

03:00.003 --> 03:02.408
Bill fuckin' Murray!
He's right there.

03:02.441 --> 03:04.613
Bill fucking Murray
actually says to Richie,

03:04.646 --> 03:06.951
he says to him, he goes,
"Why are you doing that?"

03:06.984 --> 03:09.990
And Richie says,
"Because it's funny."

03:10.023 --> 03:12.829
He fucking says
that to Bill Murray,
"Because it's funny."

03:12.862 --> 03:14.232
And Bill Murray says, "No, no."

03:14.265 --> 03:15.902
-RICHIE: "No, it's not."
-"That is not funny."

03:15.935 --> 03:17.739
He goes, "Give me your phone."

03:17.772 --> 03:18.908
RICHIE:
Yeah, yep.

03:18.941 --> 03:20.578
And then he goes...

03:22.047 --> 03:23.416
"What's your name?"

03:24.018 --> 03:24.853
Right?

03:24.887 --> 03:27.457
I mean, Bill Murray
says this to me.

03:27.992 --> 03:28.995
The king.

03:29.028 --> 03:29.897
Fuckin' Bill Murray.

03:29.930 --> 03:31.867
Yeah, no,
I understand
who that is.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.474
If you call me,
you can hear it.

03:35.508 --> 03:36.710
-I get it.
-RICHIE: Call me.

03:36.743 --> 03:37.578
-I-I-I--
-I still got it.

03:37.612 --> 03:39.015
-I believe you--
-It's still on my phone.

03:39.048 --> 03:40.383
I'm good.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.722
-RICHIE: Really?
-Thank you.

03:43.757 --> 03:44.726
You don't wanna hear it?

03:47.064 --> 03:49.769
You guys were at a bar
at 6:45 in the morning?

03:51.874 --> 03:53.310
Uh...

03:53.343 --> 03:55.481
Yeah, but, I mea--

03:55.515 --> 03:57.350
The, the whole point of it is--

04:05.935 --> 04:07.738
(sirens wailing)

04:13.049 --> 04:15.420
(upbeat music playing)

04:23.069 --> 04:25.440
(sizzling)

04:25.473 --> 04:27.378
-RICHIE: Okay, there we go.
That's a good picture.
-Checks!

04:27.411 --> 04:28.647
RICHIE:
That's better.

04:29.683 --> 04:30.384
She has nice eyes.

04:30.417 --> 04:31.921
RICHIE:
She does have nice eyes.

04:31.954 --> 04:33.156
No sense of humor, you know.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.993
-And even worse,
Tina, I'll tell you...
-SYDNEY: Behind.

04:35.026 --> 04:36.362
...even actually much worse,

04:36.395 --> 04:39.536
-it's like she got no--
-Behind.

04:39.569 --> 04:42.976
no sense of Chicago history,
you know what I'm saying?

04:43.009 --> 04:44.613
Whatever, other fish in the sea.

04:44.646 --> 04:47.351
See you in another
galaxy, puta.

04:47.384 --> 04:49.388
-(Tina laughs)
-Yo, listen up!

04:49.421 --> 04:51.358
Okay, I just yelled like that?

04:51.927 --> 04:53.463
Yeah, make it worth it.

04:53.497 --> 04:56.402
Take this green tape off
before it gets to us.

04:56.435 --> 04:58.106
It takes five seconds,

04:58.139 --> 05:00.010
'cause once it's soapy
and our fingers are pruned,

05:00.043 --> 05:02.682
we can't fuck
with this shit, cool?

05:02.715 --> 05:03.818
ALL:
Yes, Chef!

05:03.851 --> 05:05.453
Thank you for your time.

05:06.523 --> 05:09.395
CARMY:
Two hours to open, Chefs.

05:09.428 --> 05:11.500
-Here, Chef, I think
this new dish is dialed.
-Great.

05:11.533 --> 05:12.836
-Can we jam on that later?
-It's what we were
talking about.

05:12.869 --> 05:15.073
-That elevated--
-Later is better for me, Chef.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.376
...the risotto
with etouffee stock.

05:16.409 --> 05:17.411
Hey, T, watch those peppers.

05:17.444 --> 05:18.714
It's easily adaptable,

05:18.747 --> 05:20.117
we can make it
for a great to-go.

05:20.150 --> 05:21.419
Are you saying
"risotto to-go" to me?

05:21.452 --> 05:22.421
I am barely convinced

05:22.454 --> 05:23.323
we're ready for to-go
at all at this point.

05:23.356 --> 05:25.027
I'm just saying if
you should dine in,

05:25.060 --> 05:26.029
dine out, plus we're
using ingredients

05:26.062 --> 05:27.131
that are just lying around here.

05:27.164 --> 05:28.968
It's pretty smart,
let's just try it.

05:29.001 --> 05:30.672
-I don't understand.
It's right here.
-Chef. Chef.

05:30.705 --> 05:31.840
-Chef. Chef.
-You can have a taste.

05:31.873 --> 05:32.508
Hey, listen to me, please.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.780
One, I'm thinking about it.

05:34.813 --> 05:36.784
So hold on, please. Okay?

05:36.817 --> 05:39.121
Two, I know everybody
you used to work for,

05:39.154 --> 05:41.025
I called them
before hiring you.

05:41.058 --> 05:42.662
And why'd you do that?

05:42.695 --> 05:44.800
Because your resume is excellent
and this place is not.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.503
Everybody said you
are incredibly smart,

05:46.536 --> 05:47.672
you are incredibly talented.

05:47.705 --> 05:50.511
They also said you
are incredibly inpatient

05:50.544 --> 05:51.579
and incredibly green.

05:51.613 --> 05:54.653
Okay, so that's why
my business couldn't cut it,

05:54.686 --> 05:56.089
that's why I'm here,
that's why you--

05:56.122 --> 05:57.391
That's not what I'm saying, no.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.126
So, So what are you saying?

05:58.159 --> 05:59.896
I'm saying, give me a minute.

06:00.798 --> 06:01.567
Yes, Chef.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.604
Okay. Now, can
you make this work

06:03.637 --> 06:05.107
-without ruining the flow?
-Yes, Chef.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.276
Did you talk
to Manny and Angel?

06:06.309 --> 06:08.079
-Yes, I spoke with them--
-They're gonna have a shit-fit--

06:08.112 --> 06:08.981
-already, Chef.
-with the pans, okay?

06:09.014 --> 06:10.852
Now, so you know
where I'm coming from.

06:10.885 --> 06:13.624
We have finally gotten
this to a place

06:13.657 --> 06:17.464
where things
are sort of, kind of
a little bit chill, right?

06:17.498 --> 06:19.870
I would like to hold on to that
as long as I possibly can.

06:19.903 --> 06:23.176
-(door pounding)
-SUGAR: God damn it, Carmy!

06:23.209 --> 06:24.613
Hey, did you get it?

06:24.646 --> 06:27.484
What, What exactly is it
I'm-I'm-I'm looking for?

06:27.518 --> 06:30.457
Oh, wow. You are special.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.694
-Yeah.
-You know, there is something

06:31.727 --> 06:33.497
called the
Internal Revenue Service

06:33.530 --> 06:35.434
and they collect taxes
from human beings.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.503
I know this, Natalie.

06:36.536 --> 06:37.638
Yeah, and the people
in this place,

06:37.672 --> 06:40.745
they haven't given that
government organization anything

06:40.778 --> 06:41.747
in five years.

06:41.780 --> 06:45.955
And somehow I'm a co-owner
in this nightmare

06:45.988 --> 06:49.629
and my home will be seized
if I don't give them some money.

06:49.662 --> 06:52.201
Okay, so I've spent
the last few days

06:52.234 --> 06:54.506
on top of my other job
and my life

06:54.539 --> 06:56.577
getting all of your
documents in order,

06:56.610 --> 06:58.514
so I can reach
an agreement with them

06:58.547 --> 06:59.816
to pay a smaller amount.

06:59.849 --> 07:02.254
So I'm gonna need you
to go in there

07:02.287 --> 07:04.693
and to get the payroll
records from 2018.

07:04.726 --> 07:05.761
Can you do that for me, please?

07:05.795 --> 07:07.699
-I can do that. I can do that.
-SUGAR: Thank you.

07:07.732 --> 07:09.101
Who's, uh, seizing
your house, Shug?

07:09.134 --> 07:11.873
Ugh. The IRS, Rich.

07:13.977 --> 07:16.149
Tax shit... Yikes.

07:16.182 --> 07:17.952
-You’re yikes.
-Yikes.

07:17.985 --> 07:18.954
Okay, go, Carmy.

07:18.987 --> 07:20.792
I know. I know exactly
where it is, alright?

07:20.825 --> 07:21.694
Thank you.

07:21.727 --> 07:23.129
Fuck you!

07:23.162 --> 07:24.699
Fuck you!

07:26.035 --> 07:29.275
Wait a minute, it's a fuck you.

07:29.308 --> 07:31.580
Why the hell would he
organize it like this?

07:31.613 --> 07:34.017
I don't know.
I'll ask him when he's not dead.

07:54.926 --> 07:56.195
(sighs)

07:56.228 --> 07:57.531
Ass.

08:00.638 --> 08:02.274
Should I be wearing
a gas mask?

08:02.307 --> 08:03.744
MARCUS:
No, man, you're good.

08:03.777 --> 08:04.880
Who's that?

08:04.913 --> 08:06.215
Hmm?

08:06.248 --> 08:08.687
Oh, that's Richard Hart.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.558
Hart Bageri in Copenhagen.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.893
That's a bad motherfucker.

08:13.029 --> 08:13.997
Cool.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.870
You good, man?

08:16.903 --> 08:17.972
Yeah, you?

08:18.005 --> 08:19.743
Yeah, yeah.

08:19.776 --> 08:25.654
You know, if you need anything,
like whatever, you know.

08:26.355 --> 08:27.892
Like what?

08:27.925 --> 08:29.529
I don't know, like--

08:30.263 --> 08:31.600
Ah, fuck it.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.971
Look, man... when I
tried out for the Cubs,

08:34.004 --> 08:36.610
I was playing on the farm team
and they wouldn't put me up,

08:36.643 --> 08:39.649
and I was broke.

08:39.682 --> 08:43.189
And I got pretty good at...
figuring out places to stay.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.162
Bro, I'm-- What?
I'm not homeless.

08:46.195 --> 08:47.665
Then what's up with the nest?

08:47.698 --> 08:49.135
Oh, I just started
sleeping here

08:49.168 --> 08:50.772
so I could save time
on my commute.

08:50.805 --> 08:53.109
I'm just so close
to nailing these donuts

08:53.142 --> 08:54.178
and they gotta be perfect.

08:54.211 --> 08:55.782
Okay, good.

08:55.815 --> 08:57.819
So you're a psychopath, cool.

08:57.852 --> 09:00.056
I just want them
to be perfect.

09:00.089 --> 09:01.058
You want perfection, bro?

09:01.091 --> 09:02.762
Start with a shower.

09:04.732 --> 09:06.804
It's not even that bad.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.141
Wait, you used to play
for the fucking Cubs?

09:15.119 --> 09:16.121
You good?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.094
Yo.

09:20.230 --> 09:21.633
You okay?

09:22.234 --> 09:23.570
Yeah.

09:26.342 --> 09:27.878
It feels weird out there.

09:30.383 --> 09:32.354
Bar closed.

09:32.387 --> 09:34.158
You go there a lot, or...

09:34.191 --> 09:35.795
RICHIE:
Nah.

09:35.828 --> 09:39.001
The owner and I
don't really see eye to eye.

09:39.034 --> 09:41.606
-Huh.
-But nice to know it
was there, you know.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.345
It was like a fixture.

09:44.378 --> 09:46.649
SYDNEY:
Yeah, like Logan...

09:47.317 --> 09:50.992
Wicker... Pilsen.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.060
Yep.

09:53.229 --> 09:55.200
They all suck now.

09:55.233 --> 09:57.271
SYDNEY:
They're different.

09:57.304 --> 09:59.643
RICHIE:
Yeah, they are different.

09:59.676 --> 10:00.711
That's why I keep
telling you guys,

10:00.744 --> 10:02.347
stop fuckin' with this place.

10:02.380 --> 10:04.151
You know, you let up
a little bit...

10:05.353 --> 10:07.257
everything changes.

10:07.290 --> 10:09.663
You know, you don't realize

10:09.696 --> 10:11.699
this is a delicate ecosystem...

10:12.802 --> 10:15.841
and it's held together
by a shared history,

10:15.874 --> 10:19.014
and love and respect.

10:23.322 --> 10:26.896
There's this statue
on top of the Board of Trade,

10:27.698 --> 10:29.401
goddess, right?

10:29.434 --> 10:30.403
She has no face.

10:30.436 --> 10:32.775
People are like,
"Where the fuck's her face?"

10:32.808 --> 10:35.447
An, uh, a-architect
John Storrs, right?

10:35.480 --> 10:38.419
John Storrs goes,
"Well, when we put it up there,

10:38.452 --> 10:39.756
"it was the tallest
building in the city

10:39.789 --> 10:41.158
"and no one really
gonna see her face,

10:41.191 --> 10:44.298
so we didn't bother to put one."

10:44.331 --> 10:47.906
But now, every goddamn building
is taller than the next one

10:47.939 --> 10:50.277
and they all just look out
at this chick with no face

10:50.310 --> 10:52.047
-and it's just--
-(gunshots)

10:52.080 --> 10:53.483
-Yo, what the fuck?
-(tires screeching)

10:53.517 --> 10:55.320
-(indistinct yelling)
-Yo, what the fuck?

10:55.353 --> 10:56.890
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:56.923 --> 10:57.759
-Is everybody alright?
-You good?

10:57.792 --> 10:58.459
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:58.493 --> 10:59.996
RICHIE:
Mother fuck!

11:00.029 --> 11:01.833
-CARMY: Everybody okay, yeah?
-SYDNEY: Yeah.

11:01.866 --> 11:03.436
-Sounds like a pistol.
-Everybody straight?

11:03.469 --> 11:05.040
RICHIE:
The fuck is going
on around here?

11:05.073 --> 11:06.342
MARCUS:
Yo, Richie, don't go out there.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.311
What you doing, bro?

11:07.344 --> 11:08.814
(indistinct chatter)

11:08.847 --> 11:10.182
JOHN:
It's getting crazy out here.

11:20.269 --> 11:23.108
Hey, yo. Crooked John.

11:24.177 --> 11:24.979
What's up?

11:25.012 --> 11:26.817
You guys see who
shot up my window?

11:26.850 --> 11:28.052
I didn't see it, man.

11:28.085 --> 11:29.956
It scared the shit
out of me though.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.459
Sounded like a little marble.

11:31.493 --> 11:32.595
Yeah, right?

11:32.629 --> 11:36.001
Probably some dumbass kid
fucking with his mom's 22.

11:37.003 --> 11:39.108
Listen, man.

11:39.141 --> 11:41.412
You know, you guys
aren't supposed
to be hanging out here.

11:41.445 --> 11:42.882
I asked you to hang out
down there.

11:42.915 --> 11:44.351
Yeah, don't call the cops.

11:44.384 --> 11:46.790
John... Don't hurt my feelings.

11:46.823 --> 11:47.959
How long have you known me?

11:47.992 --> 11:50.230
Alright, I do not give
a fuck what you do

11:50.263 --> 11:51.265
or who you do it with.

11:51.298 --> 11:53.036
All I ask is you
do it over there

11:53.069 --> 11:55.508
and, you know, keep it
at a reasonable volume.

11:55.541 --> 11:57.110
But we can't chill
over there, man.

11:57.143 --> 11:58.413
RICHIE:
Why can't you chill over there?

11:58.446 --> 12:00.116
-It's dangerous.
-RICHIE: Dangerous?

12:00.149 --> 12:02.020
But you motherfuckers
have weapons on you.

12:02.053 --> 12:05.160
It's a different dangerous.
Construction dangerous.

12:05.193 --> 12:07.498
The vent went cold,
the whole shit's gutted.

12:07.531 --> 12:08.834
They're building a Sweetgreen.

12:08.867 --> 12:11.305
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

12:11.338 --> 12:12.474
You know, the bar's closed too.

12:12.508 --> 12:14.111
It's getting ugly.

12:14.144 --> 12:17.117
Alright, I'll tell you what,
do me a favor, okay?

12:17.150 --> 12:19.355
Ask around,
and see if you can sniff out

12:19.388 --> 12:20.992
who shot up my shit.

12:21.025 --> 12:22.829
-Check Alice. Alright?
-Okay.

12:22.862 --> 12:25.166
In exchange, you guys
can hang out here,

12:25.199 --> 12:27.237
but low pro, alright?

12:27.270 --> 12:28.339
I don't want any noise.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.811
I don't want any fucking
gangster shit popping off.

12:30.844 --> 12:33.349
I don't want anything
that's gonna freak out
my customers, okay?

12:33.382 --> 12:34.519
-Alright, alright.
-You dig?

12:34.552 --> 12:37.290
-Dug. Respect, alright?
-RICHIE: Alright.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.527
Thanks, pal.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.262
You all heard him. Okay?

12:46.782 --> 12:48.284
-Wow, I love coming here.

12:52.747 --> 12:54.585
-RICHIE: Are you okay?
-Hmm, yeah, you?

12:54.618 --> 12:57.557
Yeah. Fuck, I don't
even know anymore.

12:59.026 --> 13:01.064
Should we call the cops?

13:01.097 --> 13:02.199
ALL:
No.

13:02.232 --> 13:03.770
They're sweeping glass up.

13:03.803 --> 13:04.505
I know.

13:04.538 --> 13:06.141
-Tuesday afternoon?
-Sugar.

13:06.174 --> 13:07.476
I'm gonna lose my house.

13:07.510 --> 13:09.147
Don't co-sign
for a drug addict.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.017
Forty-five minutes
to open, Chefs!

13:11.050 --> 13:12.153
ALL:
Yes, Chef.

13:12.186 --> 13:13.923
Keep not processing
trauma, Carm.

13:13.956 --> 13:15.593
Dude, what? I can't close.

13:15.626 --> 13:17.631
Yeah, just keep working.
It's like nothing ever happened.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.035
A window got shot out,
everybody is fine, the end.

13:20.068 --> 13:21.204
'Cause that's what
I'm talking about.

13:21.237 --> 13:22.573
-Natalie.
-Carmy.

13:24.176 --> 13:25.212
You're pissing me off.

13:25.245 --> 13:26.882
And you're pissing me off!

13:26.982 --> 13:27.884
Fucking go.

13:35.933 --> 13:36.935
What?

13:38.973 --> 13:40.475
I didn't say anything.

13:45.218 --> 13:47.489
Did you find, uh, Sugar's--

13:48.659 --> 13:49.661
I don't know--

13:51.965 --> 13:53.869
No. No, I didn't find it.

13:56.675 --> 13:58.245
Yeah.

13:58.278 --> 14:00.917
Paperwork's not really my jam.

14:00.950 --> 14:02.019
Me neither.

14:04.958 --> 14:08.699
They didn't teach you
accounting at, uh... Noma?

14:11.872 --> 14:13.108
They teach you at DeVry?

14:13.141 --> 14:14.209
Yeah.

14:14.778 --> 14:15.680
(sniffs)

14:17.917 --> 14:18.819
What is that, oven?

14:21.692 --> 14:22.627
No.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.535
No, it was, um...

14:27.971 --> 14:29.841
Michael's 15th birthday party.

14:31.712 --> 14:33.616
Jan-Carlo and Fak
got into a fight,

14:33.649 --> 14:35.920
I tried to break it up,
I fell into the barbecue.

14:39.026 --> 14:40.061
Fak.

14:47.677 --> 14:49.748
Is there a name
for that thing where

14:51.618 --> 14:52.988
you're afraid of something
good happening

14:53.021 --> 14:54.958
'cause you think something
bad's gonna happen?

14:58.031 --> 14:59.233
I don't know.

15:00.001 --> 15:01.003
Life?

15:08.686 --> 15:10.857
Other night my kid asked me if

15:10.890 --> 15:13.596
my real last name
is "Bad News."

15:13.629 --> 15:15.566
Bad News. Like Bad News Bears?

15:16.935 --> 15:20.609
I guess I'm in her mom's phone
as "Richie Bad News."

15:24.818 --> 15:25.786
I go...

15:26.622 --> 15:28.993
Tiff, "What the fuck?"

15:29.026 --> 15:30.261
You know.

15:31.632 --> 15:33.903
She says I'm contagious,

15:33.936 --> 15:35.873
I only call with bad news.

15:41.952 --> 15:44.022
Maybe that's not what
you're talking about.

15:47.997 --> 15:49.768
Fuck, I don't know.

15:50.803 --> 15:51.805
Fuck it all.

16:21.865 --> 16:25.072
Alright,
put me outta my misery.

16:25.105 --> 16:26.074
Flip it, T.

16:26.107 --> 16:28.144
Hey, look alive, Chefs, we open.

16:28.177 --> 16:29.413
Ba-da-ra-ka. Let's go.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.351
Alright. Come on,
step right in. Let's go.

16:31.384 --> 16:34.658
Oh, shit, it's the man
with the golden dick.

16:34.691 --> 16:36.127
How are you, Tom?

16:36.160 --> 16:38.198
Good to see you, bro.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.271
Let me get one beef,
little hot, little sweet,
dip it!

16:41.304 --> 16:42.239
Thanks, Tom.

16:42.273 --> 16:44.945
How is that
dog of yours,
by the way?

16:44.978 --> 16:46.080
Okay, man?

16:46.114 --> 16:48.953
Got the, the thing off,
the cone and everything off?

16:48.986 --> 16:49.954
How are you?

16:51.257 --> 16:54.230
(scatting)

16:54.263 --> 16:57.002
(soft rock song playing)

17:04.751 --> 17:06.420
TINA:
Damn, Chef!

17:13.001 --> 17:14.771
Mm!

17:14.804 --> 17:15.806
Brava.

17:17.075 --> 17:18.278
Thanks, Chef.

17:18.311 --> 17:19.781
CARMY:
Alright, Ebra and Richie
are out front.

17:19.814 --> 17:21.852
Tina, you're floating.
We good back here, Chefs?

17:21.885 --> 17:23.021
-ALL: Yes, Chef.
-CARMY: Alright, shit.

17:23.054 --> 17:24.992
We better watch the heat
on the stove, guys.

17:25.025 --> 17:27.162
Those chickens are coming
out pretty dark, yeah?

17:27.195 --> 17:29.267
Yo, Sweeps,
when was the last time you
cleaned out the grease trap?

17:29.300 --> 17:31.137
-It's getting
backed up in there.
-SWEEPS: I'll get to it.

17:31.170 --> 17:32.941
-Still dealing with
the circuit breaker.
-CARMY: Thank you, Chef.

17:32.974 --> 17:35.078
Alright, Chef, you think
now might be a good time

17:35.111 --> 17:36.281
for you to try this?

17:36.314 --> 17:37.316
Yes, thank you for asking.

17:37.349 --> 17:38.351
Yes.

17:38.384 --> 17:39.988
-This one?
-Yes.

17:50.776 --> 17:52.179
It's tremendous, Chef.

17:52.212 --> 17:53.180
Thank you, Chef.

17:54.316 --> 17:55.820
Sauce is a little bit tight.

17:55.853 --> 17:57.222
Yeah, heard, thank you.

17:57.255 --> 17:58.291
Mm! Mm-hmm!

17:58.324 --> 18:01.164
Um, do you think maybe so--

18:01.197 --> 18:02.299
-Fire.
-Thank you.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.367
Uh...

18:03.401 --> 18:06.809
Maybe we start rolling it out
as a special soon?

18:06.842 --> 18:09.012
-See how it plays.
-It's getting closer, yeah.

18:10.015 --> 18:12.186
How... How close?

18:12.219 --> 18:13.889
I told you it was great.

18:13.922 --> 18:16.027
You actually said "tremendous,"
if you remember.

18:16.060 --> 18:17.863
I didn't tell you
it was perfect.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.433
Well, yeah.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.437
I mean, you know, I-I like it.

18:21.470 --> 18:24.377
I think it's great
and I'll definitely
loosen up the sauce.

18:24.410 --> 18:28.485
-Sydney... Sydney.
-Just, you know,
I don't understand.

18:28.519 --> 18:30.054
Chef, it's not ready yet.

18:31.090 --> 18:32.158
You understand?

18:33.829 --> 18:35.500
Yes, Chef, I understand.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.302
-Thank you, Chef.
-Thank you, Chef.

18:43.982 --> 18:47.155
Hi, um, these are Cola-braised
short ribs with risotto,

18:47.824 --> 18:49.327
and they're yours.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.464
-Really?
-SYDNEY: Yep, I had an extra.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.268
And I'm Sydney,
if you need anything else.

18:53.301 --> 18:55.506
Well, thank you, Sydney.

18:55.539 --> 18:56.942
SYDNEY:
Have a good day.

19:01.852 --> 19:02.988
Hey, Sugar, maybe it's not here.

19:03.021 --> 19:04.958
-No, it's here.
-CARMY: All right.

19:05.993 --> 19:07.128
(exhales)

19:22.392 --> 19:25.967
I knew it was dumb
to co-sign, FYI.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.202
CARMY:
I would've done the same thing.

19:30.341 --> 19:31.443
-You wanna fight?
-Please.

19:33.147 --> 19:34.985
-I know you're mad at me.
-This is just irresponsible.

19:35.018 --> 19:38.158
No, no, no, no.
I mean, at your house,
all that stuff you said.

19:38.191 --> 19:39.326
I was annoyed.

19:39.359 --> 19:40.897
Yeah, clearly.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.303
Ah, look, I think the thing
that just pisses me off,

19:44.336 --> 19:48.110
is, is the thing
that I'm probably too
embarrassed to admit.

19:50.181 --> 19:53.020
Is that you never ask me
how I'm doing.

19:53.589 --> 19:55.292
Like ever.

19:55.325 --> 19:56.427
(sighs)

19:56.460 --> 19:57.997
I know it's childish, but...

19:59.299 --> 20:00.836
that's why I'm mad at you...

20:01.938 --> 20:03.408
I think.

20:03.441 --> 20:06.180
Plus, we never spend
any real time together.

20:06.213 --> 20:08.953
This place is eating
you alive, you know.

20:08.986 --> 20:10.422
You always blame this place.

20:10.455 --> 20:11.525
What do you mean?

20:11.558 --> 20:13.294
CARMY:
I mean, you blame
the restaurant, right?

20:13.327 --> 20:16.568
You don't blame Mom,
you don't blame Mikey.

20:16.601 --> 20:18.438
SUGAR:
How can I not blame this place?

20:18.471 --> 20:20.342
I just cleaned up shot-out glass

20:20.375 --> 20:23.080
and now I'm covered in carbon.

20:24.517 --> 20:27.423
All of our time, money, work,

20:27.456 --> 20:30.328
gets sucked up into this place.

20:30.361 --> 20:35.138
The only thing we get back
is chaos, resentment.

20:39.346 --> 20:40.314
It's bullshit.

20:42.152 --> 20:43.455
Sounds like Mom.

20:43.488 --> 20:45.325
-I'm serious.
-I'm serious.

20:45.358 --> 20:46.394
(Sugar scoffs)

20:46.427 --> 20:48.933
I just want things to be calm.

20:48.966 --> 20:50.937
I just want things
to be on solid ground.

20:50.970 --> 20:53.274
-I-I-I want things to feel--
-Consistent.

20:53.307 --> 20:55.212
Yeah, consistent.

20:55.245 --> 20:56.447
CARMY:
Yeah.

20:58.384 --> 21:00.222
That's totally reasonable.

21:00.255 --> 21:01.323
SUGAR:
Well...

21:03.495 --> 21:05.098
I appreciate you saying that.

21:06.233 --> 21:08.170
CARMY:
Um...

21:09.974 --> 21:13.114
I guess all the time
I feel like I'm kind of trapped

21:14.383 --> 21:19.360
because I can't describe...
how I'm feeling.

21:19.393 --> 21:24.003
So to ask somebody else
how they're feeling,

21:24.036 --> 21:25.471
that just seems, uh...

21:28.444 --> 21:30.248
I don't know, insane?

21:30.281 --> 21:31.350
(laughs)

21:34.389 --> 21:35.660
Okay.

21:35.693 --> 21:39.099
CARMY:
But I'm sorry,
you know, you're um...

21:39.132 --> 21:41.403
you're right.
I wanna know how you're feeling.

21:45.713 --> 21:47.584
How are you feeling?

21:47.617 --> 21:48.719
(Sugar scoffs)

21:48.752 --> 21:50.255
Really good.

21:50.288 --> 21:51.423
Just great.

21:53.695 --> 21:54.997
Right.

22:01.645 --> 22:03.247
(exhales)

22:08.625 --> 22:11.363
Yo. Yo, is this it?

22:13.602 --> 22:15.305
Uh...

22:15.338 --> 22:16.742
-Y-Yeah.
-Yeah.

22:16.775 --> 22:18.410
-Right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:19.179 --> 22:20.750
Just, uh...

22:20.783 --> 22:24.389
-sitting in this
file labeled...
-BOTH: "Shit."

22:34.409 --> 22:36.548
(indistinct chatter)

22:37.482 --> 22:39.721
Hey. Checks.

22:39.754 --> 22:42.059
The lowboys look great, guys.

22:42.092 --> 22:44.196
-(indistinct arguing)
-Oh shit! What's he doing?

22:44.229 --> 22:46.735
-(arguing continues)
-(horns honking)

22:46.768 --> 22:48.438
What's going on
with these edges, Chef?

22:48.471 --> 22:49.440
You gotta be cleaner than that.

22:49.473 --> 22:50.275
This knife is shit.

22:50.308 --> 22:51.210
Okay, well, you
gotta sharpen it.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.047
When was the last time
you sharpened it?

22:54.617 --> 22:56.622
Fuck!
Where's my gun?

22:56.655 --> 22:58.424
Any of you motherfuckers
take my gun?

23:01.363 --> 23:02.600
Carmy!

23:02.633 --> 23:04.470
(indistinct arguing)

23:04.504 --> 23:06.407
What? You know I stay here.

23:06.440 --> 23:07.409
Huh? Fuck me!

23:07.442 --> 23:08.779
He's gonna get him!

23:08.812 --> 23:10.215
Um... Uh...

23:10.248 --> 23:11.752
Hello. Everyone, uh,
thank you so much

23:11.785 --> 23:12.687
for your patronage.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.089
Everything's under control.

23:14.122 --> 23:16.662
Um, please enjoy your beefs.
Focus on that.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.398
Uh, Chicago, am I right?

23:18.431 --> 23:20.235
(indistinct arguing)

23:20.268 --> 23:21.538
Hey, guys!

23:21.571 --> 23:24.076
-(arguing continues)
-Hey! Guys!

23:24.109 --> 23:26.748
Guys! Shut up! Please.

23:27.817 --> 23:29.085
Thank you.

23:30.388 --> 23:31.456
What's going on here?

23:32.526 --> 23:33.562
This isn't his space.

23:33.595 --> 23:36.100
(indistinct arguing)

23:36.133 --> 23:37.537
Yeah, 'cause you're--

23:37.570 --> 23:39.808
Hey! Hey!

23:39.841 --> 23:42.647
Can we lower our voices, please?

23:42.680 --> 23:44.116
Thank you.

23:44.149 --> 23:46.253
I'm Sydney, let's start there.

23:46.286 --> 23:47.188
I'm Sydney.

23:47.657 --> 23:48.692
John.

23:48.725 --> 23:50.194
Mr. Carl.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.702
Okay, Mr. Carl and John.

23:53.735 --> 23:57.442
Hello, associates,
good afternoon.

23:57.475 --> 23:58.477
Uh...

24:00.415 --> 24:03.121
(Richie screams)
Fuck!

24:03.154 --> 24:04.790
-We didn't take your gun, bro.
-Fuck!

24:05.759 --> 24:08.131
Shit.

24:08.164 --> 24:11.838
You apparently know
Tina and Gary as well.

24:11.871 --> 24:14.209
Great, so now we all
are in various states

24:14.242 --> 24:15.546
of knowing each other.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.682
Cool, okay.

24:16.715 --> 24:19.153
So... So, how do we fix this?

24:19.186 --> 24:21.390
Can't be fixed
because this guy's a bitch.

24:21.423 --> 24:23.328
Oh, you fuckin' said it
for the last time.

24:23.361 --> 24:26.099
-(indistinct arguing)
-No! No!

24:46.206 --> 24:48.512
-Alright, so we do this
every week, yeah?

24:48.545 --> 24:52.720
Sandwiches,
civil conversation,
no yelling,

24:52.753 --> 24:55.358
no, no smoking
where all the food is.

24:55.391 --> 24:57.295
-You know what
I mean, alright?
-Okay.

24:57.328 --> 24:59.166
-SYDNEY: Okay.
-JOHN: Gonna need a pop too.

24:59.199 --> 25:00.168
Wash down the sandwiches.

25:00.201 --> 25:02.573
RC, Green River,
whatever we're working with.

25:03.474 --> 25:05.245
Sure. Great.

25:05.278 --> 25:07.650
Deal only applies to the guys
that's out here right now,

25:07.683 --> 25:10.255
so don't go telling your auntie,
brother, cousins, friends

25:10.288 --> 25:11.858
to come down here
every Tuesday, okay?

25:11.891 --> 25:13.495
-Cool.
-Alright.

25:13.528 --> 25:16.200
Cool. Okay, so we good?

25:16.233 --> 25:18.772
Great, you guys take these.

25:18.805 --> 25:20.609
Wild, man.
Stay safe out here, G.

25:20.642 --> 25:21.912
MR. CARL:
Hey, fancy now, my guy?

25:21.945 --> 25:23.882
SWEEPS:
Yeah, man, real fancy.

25:23.915 --> 25:25.485
This is exactly what
happens when you

25:25.519 --> 25:27.590
sweep the Padres
but fail the drug test.

25:27.623 --> 25:28.424
MR. CARL:
Ooh!

25:28.457 --> 25:30.328
-(laughter)
-(indistinct chatter)

25:30.361 --> 25:31.296
It's handled.

25:36.373 --> 25:38.344
JOHN:
Alright, you think we
can handle this, Mr. Carl?

25:39.580 --> 25:40.515
MR. CARL:
Okay.

25:43.254 --> 25:45.893
This fuckin' goon,
he pulls up again, right?

25:45.926 --> 25:48.364
Tina, now, this is
the third stoplight, right--

25:48.397 --> 25:51.237
Let me get, uh,
two dogs, two chickens,
four all day, please!

25:51.270 --> 25:53.408
Two dogs,
two chickens,
four all day.

25:53.441 --> 25:55.646
RICHIE:
So finally I roll down
the window, right?

25:55.679 --> 25:59.788
And I'm like, "Guy, take
a breath, it's a fuckin' Honda,

25:59.821 --> 26:00.957
let's just chill for a second."

26:00.990 --> 26:02.426
Sorry about that, but you're
gonna love this next shit.

26:02.459 --> 26:03.629
-Listen to this--
-Yeah. I-I-I...

26:03.662 --> 26:05.800
-I'm rocking in here,
I'm rocking.
-Oh, you rocking?

26:05.833 --> 26:07.402
-Richie, I need you
on register--
-RICHIE: Yeah, one second here.

26:07.435 --> 26:08.705
Let me just fuckin'
tell this story.

26:08.738 --> 26:09.908
-Richie!
-Just one second here.

26:09.941 --> 26:10.843
-SYDNEY: Richie!
-Yeah, one second.

26:10.876 --> 26:11.745
-Richie, now.
-Yo!

26:11.778 --> 26:14.584
Will you shut the fuck
up for a second!

26:14.617 --> 26:17.656
TINA:
Richard, outside!
Outside now.

26:20.428 --> 26:23.267
Damnit, I'm gonna
throw some shit at you.

26:24.704 --> 26:27.342
You remember, T, this place
used to be cool, man.

26:27.375 --> 26:29.981
TINA:
You need to go home
and cool off.

26:30.014 --> 26:31.952
-What?
-You need to get outta here.

26:31.985 --> 26:33.488
You are fuckin' my shit up.

26:33.522 --> 26:35.425
RICHIE:
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

26:35.458 --> 26:37.295
I feel like I'm on a different
fucking planet right now.

26:37.328 --> 26:40.936
My, My game has improved
300% in two months.

26:40.969 --> 26:43.675

and, and smooth, and--

26:48.885 --> 26:50.956
Yo, I love Mikey.

26:50.989 --> 26:53.962
You know how much
I love that kid,

26:53.995 --> 26:56.567
but, this...

26:58.337 --> 27:01.978
this is real and alive, and--

27:02.880 --> 27:03.982
And what?

27:05.017 --> 27:06.319
And good.

27:07.857 --> 27:09.259
It's good.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.297
RICHIE:
Tina.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.334
They're kids, you know.

27:13.367 --> 27:16.575
She doesn't understand.
She's a baby, you know.

27:16.608 --> 27:18.579
Walking around thinking
that she can handle shit.

27:18.612 --> 27:21.551
This is a delicate
fuckin' ecosystem!

27:24.489 --> 27:26.026
I don't need this
right now, I really don't.

27:26.059 --> 27:27.128
I cannot fuckin'
emphasize enough

27:27.161 --> 27:29.834
how much I don't fuckin'
need this shit right now.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.548
I'mma quit.

27:36.581 --> 27:37.583
Quit?

27:43.093 --> 27:44.997
And where you
gonna go, Richie?

27:47.368 --> 27:48.705
Where you gonna go?
