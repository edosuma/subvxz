Compared to last split,

00:38.516 --> 00:40.127
he has much better
jungle-to-lane communication.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.867
He is playing so well right now,

00:41.998 --> 00:43.695
and it's why Fugitive
is doing well.

00:43.826 --> 00:46.263
Nightfall is as good a player
as he is a cosplayer,

00:46.394 --> 00:48.570

great cosplayer.

Everyone's talking about how
Nightfall is this crazy jungler,

00:58.884 --> 01:00.756
and I mean, uh, he is, but...

01:00.886 --> 01:02.410
ever since this
new top laner came in,

01:02.540 --> 01:03.802
things have been going
a little more efficiently,

No, he's definitely the carry.

KAIZEN: Tyrant, of all people,
came into this team

01:13.856 --> 01:16.250

the much-needed strong

01:16.380 --> 01:18.600
weak-side top lane play
that the team needed,

01:18.730 --> 01:20.819
and has allowed Nightfall
to just do what he does best,

around the rest of the map.

the entirety of the map,

01:40.187 --> 01:42.972
but you can't help
but question

01:43.103 --> 01:45.714
how long these wins can go
for Fugitive Gaming

01:45.844 --> 01:48.020
when the bot-lane
is still so out of sync

01:48.151 --> 01:51.023
with the rest of the team's
and with themselves.

because, you know,

02:01.991 --> 02:03.949
because my teammates
made it really easy, so...

02:04.080 --> 02:05.386
Well, on the note
of your teammates,

02:05.516 --> 02:07.170
there has been
a lot of criticism

specifically that bot-lane.

can say whatever they want,

I'm not concerned at all.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.876
I-I believe in them, truly.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.748
There's so many questions
about their ownership,

08:33.164 --> 08:34.426
-it's just, um... Right.
-No, I-I like

08:34.557 --> 08:35.689
the diversity I see here.
This motley crew,

08:35.819 --> 08:37.517
-as I was saying before.
-JULIE: Mm-hmm.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.345
A crew... A bunch of, you know,
a bunch of single guys.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.478
Yeah. Bunch of single guys.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.134
I'm married.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.135
-Yeah.
-Okay.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.354
Well, um, "F" them up,

08:49.485 --> 08:50.878
-as-as the kids say.
-[all laugh]

08:51.008 --> 08:52.009
No pressure. No pressure.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.881
-Impress Gerry.
-Relax.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.012
-Go over your strategies.
-No, I-I thrive under pressure,

08:55.143 --> 08:56.405
-so...
-Wow. Big pressure.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.059
-Big pressure. Get Gerry.
-KYLE: All right.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.190
-Really looking forward to it.
-KYLE: That's great.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.191
-Okay.
-It was nice to meet you.

09:00.322 --> 09:01.715
-Yeah.
-All righty.

09:01.845 --> 09:02.759
-KYLE: Okay, do you want to...?
-Shall we?

09:02.890 --> 09:03.847
-Okay.
-CREAMCHEESE: Bye, guys.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.283
-JULIE: Bye.
-KYLE: All right.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.807
-See you later, Cream.
-See you later.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.330
-She's cool. I like her, yeah.
-KYLE: Okay.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.374
JULIE:
Yeah, there were other things

09:09.505 --> 09:10.332
that I could invest in,

09:10.462 --> 09:12.073
like real estate

09:12.203 --> 09:14.379
or some random stocks,
but I don't even know them.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.859
That stuff is boring to me.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.470
I mean, I'm a mid laner,
so I-I was Plat,

09:18.601 --> 09:21.038
but-but these guys...

09:21.169 --> 09:22.605
These guys are just, like...

09:22.736 --> 09:25.652
They're on a whole nother level.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.175
I mean, I am watching the game,

09:27.305 --> 09:29.699
but I'm also...
I'm watching the players.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.266
'Cause there's a player cam,

09:31.396 --> 09:33.485
and I'm locked in
on the player cam,

09:33.616 --> 09:35.618
and I can see them.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.489
And it's like I can see them

09:37.620 --> 09:39.448
making those choices, you know?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.190
I can also see just them

09:42.320 --> 09:44.453
there, sitting.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.151
You know, they're so, like...

09:50.154 --> 09:52.156
...hot.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.291
CAPTAINFLOWERS: And
a huge Equalizer from Nightfall

09:56.421 --> 09:58.598
cuts through the entire team.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.338
AZAEL:
That's gonna be third dragon.

10:00.469 --> 10:01.862
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
What a play from the jungler.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.907
RUDY JR.:
Hell yeah.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.693
-And Gerry? Gerry.
-That's a good... Yeah?

10:06.823 --> 10:08.782
-That's Nightfall.
-Right.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.348
That's the motherfucker
I was talking about.

10:10.479 --> 10:13.221
GERRY: Nightfall made
that happen. Wonderful.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.092
AZAEL: Fugitive have it there
and they're going down mid lane,

10:15.223 --> 10:17.355
looking to clean this one up.

10:17.486 --> 10:18.879
Wait, we can end here.
End here.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.445
-NIGHTFALL: Yeah.
-Come five mid and end.

10:20.576 --> 10:21.925
No, no, we should 1-3-1
and push all lanes in.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.274
CREAMCHEESE: No, bro,
we have a huge wave here.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.928
We have a huge wave.
We got to force a fight.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.408
-Org, come-come in.
-NIGHTFALL: Bro, come back.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.018
CREAMCHEESE:
What the fuck are you doing?

10:28.149 --> 10:29.759
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
That's not where he needs to be.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.195
He is caught, he is isolated.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.544
Dude, just come back!

10:32.675 --> 10:34.111
CREAMCHEESE:
Oh, my fucking God.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.636
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
And Organizm is down.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.638
NIGHTFALL: We can still win,
we can still win.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.466
CAPTAINFLOWERS: Nightfall's
going in both barrels blazing.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.817
They'll mop up everybody.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.471
Immortals has nothing
left in the tank.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.299
-Nice, nice.
-Easy, easy, easy, easy!

10:48.430 --> 10:50.519
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
Fugitive will take the Nexus

10:50.650 --> 10:53.261
with an incredible performance
from Nightfall.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.655
Fuck yeah!

10:55.785 --> 10:57.134
-Good fucking game.
-Let's fucking go!

10:57.265 --> 10:59.049
That was fucking sick,
Nightfall.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.485
You little dirty dog.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.487
[overlapping chatter]

11:02.618 --> 11:04.228
[cheering, applause]

11:04.359 --> 11:05.926
-[whoops]
-Let's go down there.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.623
Let's go down there
before they come onstage.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.320
Yeah, yeah, let's do that,
let's do that, come on.

11:09.451 --> 11:12.889
Awesome win here from Fugitive,
and I've got nothing

11:13.020 --> 11:14.804
but praises for Nightfall.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.240
The man had

11:16.371 --> 11:18.460
yet another
incredible performance

11:18.590 --> 11:20.027
-here in summer.
-I mean, he is cruising.

11:20.157 --> 11:21.811
I've got some criticisms
for the bot-lane, though.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.421
They were looking

11:23.552 --> 11:25.423
-a little bit sloppy.
-[laughs]: Yeah.

11:25.554 --> 11:26.686
AZAEL:
But Nightfall carried them

11:26.816 --> 11:28.078
to their third straight win.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.124
Seven and two in the last nine.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.214
This man is crushing it.

11:33.344 --> 11:36.086
-[cheering, applause]
-That was so good. So, so good.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.088
Hey, thanks so much for coming.

11:38.219 --> 11:41.178
[overlapping chatter]

11:41.309 --> 11:43.137
There goes the big guy, huh?

11:43.267 --> 11:45.487
It was an honor,
Mr. Creamcheese.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.141
Fuck!

11:47.271 --> 11:50.057
CREAMCHEESE: Jesus, man,
don't-don't embarrass us

11:50.187 --> 11:51.493
just 'cause you made

11:51.623 --> 11:52.581
-a horrible call.
-KYLE: Cream. Cream.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.451
It would've worked if you just

11:53.582 --> 11:54.801
fucking listened, man!

11:54.931 --> 11:56.237
KYLE:
Can you chill out, please?

11:56.367 --> 11:57.847
My God, communicating.
He's-he's talking.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.414
He's being an asshole,
but he's communicating.

11:59.544 --> 12:00.807
-Well, you a shit shot caller!
-KYLE: So sorry.

12:00.937 --> 12:01.982
-Sorry about that.
-KYLE: Cream, you want to

12:02.112 --> 12:03.461
take a lap real quick, please?

12:03.592 --> 12:04.767
CREAMCHEESE:
It's kind of a breakthrough,

12:04.898 --> 12:06.421
-though, honestly.
-KYLE: Cream!

12:06.551 --> 12:08.075
APRIL:
I see gamers melt down

12:08.205 --> 12:09.076
all the time.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.860
I'm pretty numb to it.

12:10.991 --> 12:16.257
But seeing Organizm explode
like that, I was floored.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.737
Well, this isn't typical,

12:17.867 --> 12:18.607
-I promise you.
-It's not all his fault, though.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.043
No, athletes' passion.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.915
-Volatility.
-Yeah.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.091
I see how excited you are
about the growth and potential,

12:24.221 --> 12:25.875
but I have to hedge the risks.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.181
I have
a fiduciary responsibility

12:27.311 --> 12:29.487
to the trust and to you.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.968
Here we've got
this potential investor

12:32.099 --> 12:36.494
who sees our edge, our brand,
our sex appeal, you know?

12:36.625 --> 12:39.671
And those are probably
her words, not mine.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.151
But Org fucked
everything up again.

12:41.282 --> 12:44.154
You know, you're lucky
to be in this team.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.634
You're lucky to play
with Creamcheese.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.114
You know that, right?

12:47.244 --> 12:48.985
So can you stop
being a solo queue player

12:49.116 --> 12:50.813
and maybe start
listening to him?

12:50.944 --> 12:53.555
Because he is a good player.
You know that by heart.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.557
Your mechanics are insane.

12:55.687 --> 12:56.993
Like, I really get it,
but I feel like,

12:57.124 --> 12:58.821
once you start listening
to Creamcheese call

12:58.952 --> 13:03.086
and actually start playing
like a team, we can win this.

13:03.217 --> 13:06.002
We can win LCS.
We can win Worlds.

13:06.133 --> 13:09.614
Sometime, like, Creamcheese
doesn't seem like a leader,

13:09.745 --> 13:11.312
but, you know, he is.

13:11.442 --> 13:14.010
Like, he can make Organizm
a better player

13:14.141 --> 13:17.318
just like he made me
a better player.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.804
♪ ♪

13:27.676 --> 13:30.722
After Guru left, lots
of Fugitive fans just assumed

13:30.853 --> 13:32.942
that his replacement
would be some big name.

13:33.073 --> 13:36.598
Guru did not give advance notice
that he was going to leave.

13:36.728 --> 13:40.036
Today I'm announcing that, uh,
I am, I'm leaving Fugitive.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.821
It was the first game
of the season.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.388
Every jungler was already
signed to contracts

13:44.519 --> 13:45.999
that are at least a year long.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.349
And I am retiring
from pro gaming.

13:48.479 --> 13:51.091
JATT: Fugitive had not budgeted
to be able to pick up

13:51.221 --> 13:53.093
another high-level jungle.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.659
APRIL: The new ownership group
was spending money

13:54.790 --> 13:56.052
on all superficial things.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.358
Nathan brought in
a marketing firm

13:57.488 --> 13:59.751
to overhaul our logo.

13:59.882 --> 14:03.146
He was so proud of putting
barbed wires in a capital "F."

14:03.277 --> 14:05.540
KYLE:
The joke around the team

14:05.670 --> 14:07.672
was that Resnick
was spending more money

14:07.803 --> 14:10.588
on our logo than on our jungler.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.505
Once it became clear we couldn't
afford a known quantity,

14:14.636 --> 14:16.159
uh, We had to get creative.

14:16.290 --> 14:19.989
Around 2016,
it was starting to become clear

14:20.120 --> 14:22.600
that the amateur talent
in East Asia rivaled

14:22.731 --> 14:25.168
some of the most expensive
pro talent in North America.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.867
So that's why we took
our search to Korea.

14:31.305 --> 14:34.569
NIGHTFALL: Yeah, I grew up
in Yangju, Korea, uh, which is

14:34.699 --> 14:36.049
about an hour outside of Seoul.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.319
APRIL:
Unlike here in North America,

14:45.449 --> 14:47.103
Internet cafés
are everywhere in Korea.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.713
For just a few dollars a day,

14:48.844 --> 14:51.412
you can play for hours
on the newest computers

14:51.542 --> 14:52.761
with super fast Internet.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.458
And that's a big reason

14:54.589 --> 14:57.418
why the talent level
in Korea is just insane.

14:57.548 --> 15:00.508
NIGHTFALL: That PC bang
was like my second home.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.205
And, yeah, I climb up

15:02.336 --> 15:04.251
the solo queue ladder,
like, really quick.

15:04.381 --> 15:07.558
And, you know, out of nowhere
I just got signed

15:07.689 --> 15:10.561
by SKT, I mean, as a trainee.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.651
But, you know, there was
no really real money in it,

15:13.782 --> 15:15.697
but it r-- I was really excited.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.873
[cheering, applause]

15:18.004 --> 15:20.006
But after a while,

15:20.136 --> 15:23.923
um, it started to become clear
that SKT were never

15:24.053 --> 15:26.577
going to bump me up
just from being a trainee.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.885
Any hope of doing this
as a career just started to,

15:30.016 --> 15:32.366
you know,
fade away a little bit.

15:32.496 --> 15:35.978
And that's when
I got a call from Fugitive.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.937
So, even though
Nightfall wasn't able

15:38.067 --> 15:40.591
to make a starting LCK roster,

15:40.722 --> 15:43.420
we were still excited because
we knew he had potential.

15:43.551 --> 15:47.598
And frankly, he was just
the-the perfect, uh, personality

15:47.729 --> 15:49.470
to replace Guru.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.254

15:57.608 --> 16:00.611
what's gonna be like
playing in NA,

16:00.742 --> 16:02.178
but everyone was
really welcoming,

16:02.309 --> 16:03.397
especially Creamcheese.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.442
Nightfall was the perfect fit.

as soon as I met him.

the premiere of Fugitive's
new jungler Nightfall,

amateur circuit

is supposed to be
an amazing experience, and...

of that experience.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.581
Fans flamed Nightfall
in his first game

16:57.712 --> 16:59.801
for "doing nothing" in a win.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.759
-He is boring.
-Oh, my goodness.

17:01.890 --> 17:02.978
Kind of a snooze-fest.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.936
For a jungler?
As far as someone

17:05.067 --> 17:07.548
that should be really making
play-- he's boring.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.637
Fans were so used to Guru.

17:09.767 --> 17:12.466
They want to see someone
just ripping his shirt off,

17:12.596 --> 17:14.033
chugging hot sauce,
flexing for the camera.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.730
KYLE:
If we lost,

17:15.860 --> 17:17.514
fans blamed Nightfall.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.908
If we won,
they called him boring.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.216
GURU: He's completely fine.
He's human celery.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.305
He's-he's someone that's, like,
you would see at a party,

17:25.435 --> 17:27.176
and you'd be like, "Oh, good
to meet you," and he'd like,

17:27.307 --> 17:29.918
"We already met. We went on
a whole road trip together."

17:30.049 --> 17:31.398
-Oh.
-You wouldn't even know.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.269
Nightfall is more
of a cerebral jungler,

17:33.400 --> 17:35.750
a pathing jungler,
a vision-oriented jungler.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.970
I-It's hard to see the tangibles
that he's bringing to a team,

17:39.101 --> 17:41.973
but the hate that he got
was so unwarranted.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.975
NIGHTFALL: People said a lot
of mean things to me,

17:44.106 --> 17:46.413
uh, especially Guru's fans.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.980
Like, I'm known
for my vision control, right?

17:49.111 --> 17:51.853
And they will be, like, you
know, "How good is your vision?"

17:51.983 --> 17:53.768
Like, "Can you see deez nuts?"

17:53.898 --> 17:55.770
APRIL:
When I first met Nightfall,

17:55.900 --> 17:58.555
he was this bubbly, funny guy.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.862
-[laughs]
-But as fans

18:00.992 --> 18:04.344
got more critical,
he-he really withdrew.

18:04.474 --> 18:08.174
KYLE: Obviously now it is
widely accepted that a team

18:08.304 --> 18:11.133
can't be a serious contender
without import players,

18:11.264 --> 18:15.398
but, you know, in 2016
NA teams were still doing okay

18:15.529 --> 18:17.487
on the world stage
with homegrown talent,

18:17.618 --> 18:20.882
so a lot of fans didn't think
that we needed import players.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.276
NIGHTFALL:
Those times were, uh,

18:23.406 --> 18:25.626
you know, r-really tough.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.976
Like, they hated me
because I'm an import.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.718
They hated me
because I wasn't Guru.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.720
Like, I couldn't
be myself anymore.

18:32.850 --> 18:36.289
Everything I did
would pretty much get flamed,

18:36.419 --> 18:41.032
and, like, that time, I just
barely wanted to go onstage.

18:41.163 --> 18:45.472
I felt a lot of judgment
from the fans.

18:45.602 --> 18:49.563
So, when the flaming
was at its absolute worst,

18:49.693 --> 18:53.828
you know, this one girl, um,
slid into my DM.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.004
At first I thought, you know,
she was a catfish,

18:56.135 --> 18:58.789
but, you know,
it turned out that she was real

18:58.920 --> 19:00.704
and she lived in L.A.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.880
and she asked me to go out.

19:03.011 --> 19:05.100
So, you know, we went
on a date, a few dates,

19:05.231 --> 19:07.320
and things got
pretty serious with her,

19:07.450 --> 19:09.278
and I lost my virginity

19:09.409 --> 19:13.761
with her, and, you know,
that-that was really great.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.632
Well, I-I haven't
really had sex a lot,

19:15.763 --> 19:18.896
but that was one of my best sex
that I ever had.

19:19.027 --> 19:21.856
I was happy for my guy,
he was, uh,

19:21.986 --> 19:25.990
he was experiencing a new
part of life, shall we say.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.516
NIGHTFALL:
But after a few days,

19:29.646 --> 19:32.127
um, I found something
really weird

19:32.258 --> 19:34.390
on my, you know, penis.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.653
Like, you know,
like a, like a white spot.

19:36.784 --> 19:40.918
CREAMCHEESE: He knocks on
the door of my room and he says,

19:41.049 --> 19:42.703
"I got to talk to you, Cream,"
and I say, you know,

19:42.833 --> 19:44.966
"What's up? Like, I'm here
for you, whatever you need."

19:45.096 --> 19:46.707
I-I think maybe they're
breaking up or something,

19:46.837 --> 19:48.926
and he says, "I have an STD.

19:49.057 --> 19:53.104
I think I-I might
have syphilis," and I'm like,

19:53.235 --> 19:56.020
"Fuck, dude, like, okay, this
is way out of my wheelhouse."

19:56.151 --> 19:59.850
"Like I-I'm not a doctor,
like, maybe I'll google it

19:59.981 --> 20:03.289
or maybe we can find a cream
or something," and I search it;

20:03.419 --> 20:06.944
syphilis is a fucked-up disease.

20:07.075 --> 20:10.687
That's nasty. I would say,
one thing to not do:

20:10.818 --> 20:13.647
search "syphilis"
and then click Google Images.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.953
Knowing that I might have STD

20:16.084 --> 20:17.955
and, you know,
not get laid again,

20:18.086 --> 20:20.828
and, you know, also,
I might even die from it.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.744
And I was like,
"Okay, this is pretty scary.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.920
"If Nightfall's got this
in his pants,

20:26.050 --> 20:28.836
that is, we got to get him
to a doctor right away."

20:28.966 --> 20:32.883
So I went to the doctor
and I pull off my, you know,

20:33.014 --> 20:35.146
boxer short, uh,
in front of her... [chuckles]

20:35.277 --> 20:38.411
and, you know,
she look at the, the spot.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.848
I'll never forget, he comes out
of the doctor's office

20:40.978 --> 20:42.806
with a huge smile
on his face and he goes...

20:42.937 --> 20:47.028
It was just a dry bit
of toilet paper. [laughs]

20:47.158 --> 20:49.770
He was glowing, man.
All he had to do was shower

20:49.900 --> 20:51.554
and wash his dick
a little bit better.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.382
It-it was something that could
have happened to anyone.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.732
After that, he was
a different Nightfall.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.299
He was, like,
on top of the world,

20:57.430 --> 20:59.910
acing every single fucking game.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.217
He was a god.
That is the Nightfall we know.

21:02.348 --> 21:06.221
The best part about that story
is that I played

21:06.352 --> 21:10.965
my best fucking game in my life,
against TL, that night.

21:11.095 --> 21:13.707
CAPTAINFLOWERS: And Fugitive
will take the Nexus.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.927
And that win from Fugitive,

21:17.058 --> 21:19.147
you know that it's all
about Nightfall.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.062
Incredible performance
from him yet again.

21:21.192 --> 21:24.239
NIGHTFALL: They wanted
to do a postgame interview

21:24.370 --> 21:26.676
because, you know,
I was Man of the Match.

21:26.807 --> 21:30.289
But I had nothing
to prove or say.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.682
CREAMCHEESE:
Hey, hey, hey, guys, listen.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.249
I just want to say something

21:34.380 --> 21:36.251
to everyone who still
thinks that Nightfall

21:36.382 --> 21:37.818
doesn't do anything

21:37.948 --> 21:39.341
or that he's boring.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.691
This game right here
proved you all wrong.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.693
This game right here proved
you all wrong.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.521
I'm just gonna say it.

21:45.652 --> 21:48.916
Nightfall is the best fucking
jungler in North America.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.831
I'm gonna get fined
for saying that,

21:50.961 --> 21:52.485
but I don't fucking care.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.443
I don't care.
I'm not gonna say it three times

21:54.574 --> 21:55.879
'cause it's gonna be
too expensive for me.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.055
But I love him.
I love him so much.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.928
So show him some love.
Let's go, Nightfall!

22:01.058 --> 22:02.886
[chanting]:
Nightfall! Nightfall!

22:03.017 --> 22:04.888
Nightfall! Nightfall!

22:05.019 --> 22:06.150
NIGHTFALL:
Creamcheese going up there

22:06.281 --> 22:07.630
and speaking out for me

22:07.761 --> 22:10.372
really meant a lot to me.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.983
Like, he was a real leader
and he was a real friend

22:13.114 --> 22:14.681
when I needed it.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.379
These days,
a lot of fans, uh, joke

22:17.510 --> 22:19.163
that Creamcheese
is a support with the ego

22:19.294 --> 22:20.556
of an AD Carry.

22:20.687 --> 22:23.298
Heimerdinger!
You fucking kidding?!

22:23.429 --> 22:27.563
But i-if you really knew Trevor,

22:27.694 --> 22:29.348
i-it wouldn't surprise you
that he chose that role.

22:29.478 --> 22:34.353
He chose to play support
because that's what he was.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.398
Oh, my God!

22:36.529 --> 22:39.053
-Dude...
-You're such a beast.

22:39.183 --> 22:40.271
JATT:
The psychology of support

22:40.402 --> 22:42.012
is different than other roles.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.231
Other roles are trying
to get gold

22:43.362 --> 22:45.494
and CS and kills for themselves.

22:45.625 --> 22:46.930
A support shouldn't care

22:47.061 --> 22:48.062
-about those things.
-Fuck yeah...

22:48.192 --> 22:49.716
What the support cares about

22:49.846 --> 22:53.110
is getting his teammates gold
and CS and kills.

22:53.241 --> 22:57.288
So a great support makes
everyone else's job easier.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.507
-Fugitive.
-Fugitive!

22:58.638 --> 23:00.466
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Fugitive!

23:00.596 --> 23:01.902
KYLE:
Back in 2016,

23:02.032 --> 23:04.861
Cream was the definition
of a support,

23:04.992 --> 23:08.125
uh, in every way,
and-and you can really see that

23:08.256 --> 23:09.823
when you look at Nightfall.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.999
APRIL:
I think that Nightfall is maybe

23:12.129 --> 23:16.090
not the same player and maybe
not the same person today

23:16.220 --> 23:17.396
without Creamcheese.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.968
[indistinct chatter]

23:27.884 --> 23:29.625
RUDY JR.: What you playing with?
What's that, a Slinky?

23:40.114 --> 23:41.376
Mm-hmm.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.342
[Irelia babbling]

23:51.473 --> 23:52.909
-KYLE: Yeah?
-She's so loud.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.345
APRIL:
You want to see what's outside?

23:54.476 --> 23:56.478
RUDY JR.:
Hey, Kyle...

23:56.609 --> 23:59.525
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

23:59.655 --> 24:01.701
APRIL:
There's a new addition, right?

24:01.831 --> 24:04.791
These socks are expensive.

24:04.921 --> 24:06.836
These are Gucci socks.

24:06.967 --> 24:09.273
Look at those. It's so silly.

24:09.404 --> 24:10.449
CREAMCHEESE: Who's that
hot guy in the corner?

24:10.579 --> 24:11.798
RUDY JR.:
Hey! Y'all tried

24:11.928 --> 24:13.190
-this kimchi pancake?
-KYLE: Uh-huh.

24:13.321 --> 24:14.844
-It's so good, dude.
-Oh, yeah.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.238
-Like, I'm mad. It's...
-Here.

24:17.368 --> 24:19.283
I give you some.
I give you some.

24:19.414 --> 24:20.763
-To take home?
-Take home.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.504
You know, you're-you're
a smart player.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.550
You know that, right?
And I-- like, I know

24:24.680 --> 24:26.552
Creamcheese thinks
the same way, you know.

24:26.682 --> 24:28.379
Like, I just wanted you to know
the other day

24:28.510 --> 24:30.207
that, you know,
everything Creamcheese does,

24:30.338 --> 24:33.384
he's really doing it
for the team, you know?

24:33.515 --> 24:34.690
-Right, Creamcheese?
-What?

24:34.821 --> 24:36.997
Like, everything you do,
like, even though

24:37.127 --> 24:39.913
you're, like, mad sometime, but
you're doing it for the team.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.349
Yeah, of course...

24:41.480 --> 24:43.656
Also, Nightfall,
this food is really good.

24:43.786 --> 24:47.486
Um, I just-- and so, no offense,
but if anyone wants to get in

24:47.616 --> 24:49.705
on a Postmates order,

24:49.836 --> 24:51.402
there's, like, a B-Dubs
a mile and a half away.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.752
I was just gonna
order some stuff.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.362
-KYLE: Are you serious?
-Yeah.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.625
Y-You said
you wanted some fries, right?

24:56.756 --> 24:59.062
Bap?

24:59.193 --> 25:01.412
-Onion rings?
-Onion rings, yes.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.675
Sick.

25:02.805 --> 25:06.417
♪ Happy birthday to you♪

25:06.548 --> 25:11.118

[cheering, applause]

25:23.739 --> 25:25.088
-You the man!
-He's my son!

25:25.219 --> 25:28.570
[cheering, applause]

25:28.701 --> 25:30.529
AZAEL: Fugitive so far
has been answering

25:30.659 --> 25:33.575
all the critics,
all the doubters.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.012
At this top-of-the-table battle
here against Cloud9,

25:36.143 --> 25:37.753
the clear number one team
in the league,

25:37.884 --> 25:40.930
their biggest challenge so far.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.671
-I'm just poking.
-Org, y-- don't go in.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.151
-I can go, I can go.
-No, you cannot. No, you cannot.

25:44.281 --> 25:45.805
I won't die.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.197
Yes, you will.
You say that every single time.

25:47.328 --> 25:48.634
Just wait in the bush,
Nightfall will clean up.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.244
Just listen to Cream, man.
Just listen.

25:50.374 --> 25:51.419
All right.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.161
I-I look up to Nightfall, so...

25:54.291 --> 25:56.772
Whenever he says something,
I-I take heed and I listen.

25:56.903 --> 25:58.861
Yeah, I-I have a good plan.
I have a plan.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.646
CAPTAINFLOWERS: Cloud9 pushing
up on this tier 2,

26:00.776 --> 26:03.649
but Nightfall's coming around
for the flank,

26:03.779 --> 26:05.912
-and takes everybody out.
-Oh, my God.

26:06.042 --> 26:08.741
-APRIL: Oh! Goddamn, Nightfall.
-KYLE: Looks good, looks good.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.090
That's your son right there.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.439
-That's right.
-That's my son.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.049
Fucking dirty, dude.

26:13.180 --> 26:14.747
That shit was good.
Good-good shit, Nightfall.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.444
See, that's what
I'm talking about, Org.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.314
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Yeah, you're right.

26:17.445 --> 26:18.751
Good call, good call.

26:18.881 --> 26:21.057
Every game, I'm watching
from the team room,

26:21.188 --> 26:22.885
a-and it's refreshing

26:23.016 --> 26:24.670
to hear a little coordination
from the bot-lane.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.149
CREAMCHEESE:
We can-- We can end here.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.411
-We can end here.
-NIGHTFALL: Yeah, yeah?

26:27.542 --> 26:28.674
-Nice. Yeah? Yeah?
-We're good.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.415
-Go, go, go, go...
-With this?

26:31.546 --> 26:33.243
CAPTAINFLOWERS: And Fugitive
comes marching in all the way

26:33.374 --> 26:35.028
to the base,
all the way to the Nexus.

26:35.158 --> 26:36.507
Hit the Nexus, hit the Nexus.
Look, we can end there.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.206
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
And they'll take the game.

26:39.336 --> 26:40.294
Nice! Nice! Nice!

26:40.424 --> 26:43.297
[cheering, applause]

26:43.427 --> 26:44.777
-APRIL: Yes!
-KYLE: There you go.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.213
APRIL:
That's what I'm talking about!

26:46.343 --> 26:48.607
-Fuck yeah! Nice!
-AZAEL: That'll do it.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.870
Fugitive were cruising today.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.960
I knew it, bro.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.918
-Good fucking job.
-CAPTAINFLOWERS: It may be

26:56.049 --> 26:58.007
Nightfall's birthday,
but save some cake

26:58.138 --> 27:00.575
for the Fugitive bottom lane.

27:00.706 --> 27:03.230
They have finally
got it together here.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.275
Azael, happy bot day indeed.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.060
AZAEL:
Man, Fugitive coming out,

27:07.190 --> 27:10.019
giving Nightfall the best
possible gift: a team game.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.195
And how about Organizm
and Creamcheese?

27:12.326 --> 27:14.110
They were on fire today.

27:14.241 --> 27:16.330
CAPTAINFLOWERS: Yeah, if you're
Nightfall, being the 1v9,

27:16.460 --> 27:18.332
being the hero, feels great.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.812
Being a guy on a team
with four other dudes

27:19.942 --> 27:22.597
that can also put up
instead of shut up,

27:22.728 --> 27:23.990
that means a lot.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.556
PAUL:
It was a huge win.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.471
I think that Organizm

27:27.602 --> 27:30.300
listening to Creamcheese finally
shows what this team can be,

27:30.431 --> 27:34.087
uh, when we communicate, when
we-we work as a cohesive team.

27:34.217 --> 27:36.089
Organizm listening to me

27:36.219 --> 27:39.135
was easily my favorite thing
he's ever done.

27:39.266 --> 27:40.528
KYLE: Look,
Creamcheese and Organizm

27:40.659 --> 27:42.095
may not be best friends,

27:42.225 --> 27:44.924
but winning helps a lot,

27:45.054 --> 27:47.404
and-and a win like this, uh,

27:47.535 --> 27:49.624
it gives us something
to build on.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.757
-NIGHTFALL: Dude, you saw that?
-BAP: We just finished the game.

27:51.887 --> 27:54.977
I'm telling you, people can
see that if you listen to us.

27:55.108 --> 27:56.805
-Listen to the team.
-That's what I'm talking about.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.720
That is what I'm talking about.
When you listen, we fucking win.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.287
-All right! Listen up.
-Okay?

28:00.417 --> 28:02.158
-Listen up.
-That was perfect.

28:02.289 --> 28:05.292
I want you each to remember
how you just played.

28:05.422 --> 28:08.338
All right? Remember how
you played out there today.

28:08.469 --> 28:11.211
I want you to lock it in,
this moment right now,

28:11.341 --> 28:12.647
next to your teammates.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.736
That right there
is how I want you to play

28:14.867 --> 28:17.043
-every game we have left.
-APRIL: Goddamn right.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.609
KYLE: I know that
League is a game

28:18.740 --> 28:20.133
a lot of us started playing

28:20.263 --> 28:21.787
because we could do it
by ourselves.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.615
Our-our safe little haven
away from everything.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.443
Away from our parents,
away from a crowded house,

28:26.574 --> 28:28.968
away from worries about money.

28:29.098 --> 28:31.797
No matter what it was,
we could go there

28:31.927 --> 28:35.670
and be by ourselves and play our
game and everything was okay.

28:35.801 --> 28:40.544
But at a certain point,
we all made a decision...

28:41.807 --> 28:43.852
...that we were no longer

28:43.983 --> 28:46.072
just gonna be playing
for ourselves.

28:46.202 --> 28:48.074
No, we wanted to be part
of something bigger.

28:48.204 --> 28:51.207
Part of a team.
That's why we joined Fugitive.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.775
And I'm gonna be honest with
you guys 'cause I always am.

28:53.906 --> 28:57.561
You know, until today, we were
not always playing like that.

28:57.692 --> 29:00.129
But those five guys
out there today?

29:00.260 --> 29:01.652
That was a team

29:01.783 --> 29:05.395
that showed me
and everybody else watching

29:05.526 --> 29:08.181
that League of Legends,
oh, it's a beautiful game.

29:08.311 --> 29:10.226
-[others chuckle]
-It's a beautiful game.

29:10.357 --> 29:12.272
And I'll tell you
something else.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.970
There are no five guys,

29:15.101 --> 29:18.713
not here, not anywhere else,

29:18.844 --> 29:20.802
that I would rather
follow into battle.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.543
I'm talking the best of them.

29:22.673 --> 29:25.807
No one else I would rather
follow than you five guys.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.243
-NIGHTFALL: Fuck yeah.
-Right?

29:27.374 --> 29:28.810
-Fuck yeah.
-So tell me this right now.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.551
Are we gonna keep
playing together?

29:30.681 --> 29:32.031
ALL:
Hell yes!

29:32.161 --> 29:33.075
-Are we gonna keep
playing like that?

29:33.206 --> 29:34.903
[all shouting]

29:35.034 --> 29:36.383
Are we gonna win a fucking

29:36.513 --> 29:37.688
-LCS championship?
-[cheering, shouting]

29:37.819 --> 29:38.994
-That's right!
-Let's fucking go!

29:39.125 --> 29:41.388
-Who are we?
-ALL: Fugitive!

29:41.518 --> 29:44.608
-One more time, who are we?
-Fugitive!

29:44.739 --> 29:46.045
All right, Paul,
can you grab me a water?

29:46.175 --> 29:47.786
PAUL:
Yeah, no problem.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.526
CREAMCHEESE: Paul, I--
I'm also-- one for me, please.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.093
KYLE [distant]:
Round of waters, Paul!

29:51.224 --> 29:52.921
PAUL:
All right, room temp?

29:53.052 --> 29:54.793
CREAMCHEESE:
Uh, yeah.
