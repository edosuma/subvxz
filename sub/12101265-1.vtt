WEBVTT

05:04.422 --> 05:05.890
<i>All right,
at the top of the hour</i>

05:05.956 --> 05:07.324
<i>this is Shock Jock Jacques</i>

05:07.391 --> 05:10.361
<i>with another episode of
"Confess Your Crime."</i>

05:10.428 --> 05:12.296
It's time for all you
scumbags out there

05:12.363 --> 05:14.765
to clear your conscience
for another week

05:14.832 --> 05:16.901
until ya fuck up again.

05:16.967 --> 05:18.701
Father Jacques will hear
your confessions now.

05:18.769 --> 05:20.171
The lines are open.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.638
Who is our first brave soul?

05:21.704 --> 05:24.707
All right, on line one
we have Kelly from Newark.

05:24.775 --> 05:26.177
<i>What'd ya do, Kelly?</i>

05:26.243 --> 05:27.845
<i>I shoplift
all the time.</i>

05:27.912 --> 05:30.713
<i>Oh, is this
Winona Ryder?</i>

05:30.781 --> 05:33.084
<i>What?</i>

05:33.150 --> 05:34.518
<i>Winona, when are you gonna
start making good movies again?</i>

05:34.584 --> 05:36.887
<i>I mean seriously,
I need 'em.</i>

05:36.954 --> 05:38.289
<i>My name is
not Winona, it's Kelly.</i>

05:38.355 --> 05:39.356
<i>It was an
attempt at humor, Kelly,</i>

05:39.423 --> 05:40.091
<i>but thank you for your call.</i>

05:40.157 --> 05:41.192
<i>Who else we got?</i>

05:42.259 --> 05:43.794
<i>All right, let's see.</i>

05:43.861 --> 05:45.262
<i>On line two, we have
Anthony from Queens.</i>

05:45.329 --> 05:48.299
<i>What'd ya do, Anthony?</i>

05:48.365 --> 05:48.933
<i>Whoa, I can't
believe I actually made it on!</i>

05:49.867 --> 05:50.901
<i>All right, check this out, guys.</i>

05:51.969 --> 05:53.337
<i>I masturbated on a public bus.</i>

05:53.404 --> 05:55.139
You mean, in the
bathroom stall?

05:55.206 --> 05:56.606
<i>No, no, no, I
mean like, right in my seat.</i>

05:56.673 --> 05:59.676
<i>Like,
I used my coat as a cover</i>

05:59.742 --> 06:01.812
<i>and, like, the girl next
to me was asleep, so...</i>

06:01.879 --> 06:04.081
Dear God, Anthony, I feel
like there is another show

06:04.148 --> 06:06.083
that you should be
calling right now.

06:06.150 --> 06:08.953
Wait, wait,
wait, Anthony, Anthony,

06:09.019 --> 06:11.755
I don't know why, I have
to ask you this right now

06:11.822 --> 06:13.090
or I'm gonna die of
morbid curiosity.

06:13.157 --> 06:14.458
<i>What's that?</i>

06:14.525 --> 06:16.327
Oh, I don't wanna
do this.

06:16.393 --> 06:19.263
How old was the girl you
were sitting next to?

06:19.330 --> 06:21.866
<i>I mean,
I think she was 15 or 16...</i>

06:21.932 --> 06:23.400
- Okay!
- Oh, and that is the end

06:23.467 --> 06:25.035
of that conversation.

06:25.102 --> 06:27.104
Thank you for
calling in, Pee Wee.

06:29.073 --> 06:30.174
Who else we got?

06:30.241 --> 06:31.041
All right, let's
see, okay, line three,

06:31.108 --> 06:32.709
we have Dean from Brooklyn.

06:32.776 --> 06:33.944
What'd ya do, Dean?

06:35.346 --> 06:36.746
Ya there, Dean?

06:36.814 --> 06:38.715
<i>Dean?</i>

06:40.551 --> 06:42.820
<i>Yeah,
yeah, this is Dean.</i>

06:43.954 --> 06:45.422
<i>I'm
already intrigued.</i>

06:45.489 --> 06:46.223
<i>You gonna confess
your crime, Dean?</i>

06:46.290 --> 06:48.893
<i>The suspense is killing us.</i>

06:50.060 --> 06:51.495
<i>I met a girl
at a club one night.</i>

06:51.562 --> 06:53.464
<i>She came back to
my house with me</i>

06:53.531 --> 06:56.200
<i>and we started to have sex.</i>

06:58.836 --> 07:02.006
<i>I wanna
cut you off Dean,</i>

07:02.072 --> 07:03.908
<i>but I just can't bring
myself to hit the button.</i>

07:03.974 --> 07:05.176
<i>I don't think...</i>

07:05.242 --> 07:06.977
<i>What happened next?</i>

07:09.413 --> 07:11.982
<i>Well, things
went fine at first,</i>

07:12.049 --> 07:15.152
<i>but then things started
to get a little rough.</i>

07:16.287 --> 07:17.521
<i>She didn't like that very much.</i>

07:17.588 --> 07:19.790
<i>She wanted to leave.</i>

07:20.591 --> 07:22.026
<i>Then what?</i>

07:22.092 --> 07:23.761
<i>Well,
as you could imagine,</i>

07:23.827 --> 07:25.963
<i>I was pretty upset.</i>

07:26.030 --> 07:28.698
<i>I started to hit her.</i>

07:29.433 --> 07:30.834
You beat her up?

07:31.835 --> 07:33.904
<i>Yeah, I...</i>

07:33.971 --> 07:38.108
<i>No, no, I, I don't
think she made it.</i>

07:42.279 --> 07:43.746
Dean,

07:44.848 --> 07:46.716
did you kill her?

07:48.252 --> 07:50.720
<i>I don't know, I...</i>

07:51.522 --> 07:54.358
<i>Yeah, yeah I did.</i>

07:54.425 --> 07:55.993
<i>I know I did.</i>

07:59.863 --> 08:01.865
<i>How long
ago was this, Dean?</i>

08:03.701 --> 08:06.470
<i>I dunno, maybe, I
dunno, about five years ago.</i>

08:06.537 --> 08:10.207
<i>Dean, Dean, have you
told anyone else about this?</i>

08:10.274 --> 08:12.843
<i>No, no, look,
I really gotta go.</i>

08:12.910 --> 08:15.846
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Goodbye.</i>

08:15.913 --> 08:19.083
<i>Uh, Dean...</i>

08:23.153 --> 08:27.358
<i>Well, ladies and
gentlemen, that just happened.</i>

10:17.769 --> 10:19.970
What are you doing?

10:45.764 --> 10:46.798
Did
you notice that

10:46.865 --> 10:49.233
we passed Janice's
store on Woodlawn today?

10:49.299 --> 10:52.035
We passed
many stores on Woodlawn.

10:52.102 --> 10:54.037
The clothing store.

10:56.540 --> 10:57.641
And?

10:59.109 --> 11:03.147
That was where you bought
the white for me, from Janice.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.015
And?

11:07.484 --> 11:09.520
Do I need to spell
it out for you?

11:12.589 --> 11:15.426
I want you to buy the
white dress for me again.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.327
I don't think so.

11:19.229 --> 11:20.364
Why not?

11:20.431 --> 11:21.198
I don't
think it's a good idea.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.133
So you're not gonna do it?

11:24.401 --> 11:25.569
I'm saying that

11:25.636 --> 11:27.104
we don't need to spend
the money right now.

11:27.171 --> 11:29.239
So we're broke?

11:29.306 --> 11:32.777
No, we're not broke, we're
actually doing very well,

11:32.844 --> 11:35.946
But it's not exactly
a necessary purchase, now is it?

11:37.481 --> 11:39.116
I think it is.

12:58.428 --> 12:59.496
I'm hungry.

12:59.563 --> 13:01.331
Yeah.

13:20.684 --> 13:23.253
You know what you're getting?

13:23.320 --> 13:24.688
Not yet.

13:24.756 --> 13:27.324
Yeah, well, pick fast, I
wanna make this a quick bite.

13:28.458 --> 13:29.794
I don't want it
to be a quick bite.

13:29.861 --> 13:32.262
I want a nice,
relaxing lunch.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.599
Okay, we can have
a relaxing quick bite.

13:38.302 --> 13:40.437
Okay, why don't
you just pick for me?

13:42.874 --> 13:44.474
Is there something wrong?

13:46.510 --> 13:48.645
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

13:50.581 --> 13:55.218
Come on, tell me.

14:03.627 --> 14:05.228
I thought I saw him again,

14:06.998 --> 14:09.232
like the last time
we were out here.

14:10.634 --> 14:11.435
And?

14:14.772 --> 14:18.375
And I
thought I saw him.

14:20.577 --> 14:22.412
Okay,
what did he look like?

14:25.382 --> 14:26.583
What do you mean
what did he look like?

14:26.650 --> 14:27.684
He looked...

14:27.752 --> 14:28.920
You know
what he looks like.

14:28.987 --> 14:30.855
Yeah, but he'd have
to be much older now,

14:30.922 --> 14:32.389
his mid-60s, probably.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.725
He looked exactly the same.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.426
So he hasn't aged at all?

14:38.029 --> 14:39.831
He looked the same.

14:39.897 --> 14:42.499
Did he see you?
Did he say anything?

14:44.701 --> 14:45.770
No.

14:45.837 --> 14:47.537
Anything else?

14:52.409 --> 14:54.277
He was wearing
the same suit.

14:54.946 --> 14:56.313
Why?

14:58.816 --> 15:00.384
What do you mean why?

15:01.418 --> 15:03.420
Why would he be
wearing the suit?

15:05.422 --> 15:06.958
I don't know why he
would be wearing the suit,

15:07.025 --> 15:09.259
but he was wearing
the suit.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.494
What, he was just
taking a stroll

15:10.560 --> 15:12.629
through town
wearing a suit?

15:12.696 --> 15:15.265
What, did he just get out
of a wedding or something?

16:21.032 --> 16:22.632
Can I come in?

17:15.418 --> 17:20.557
Christine, Christine,
wake up, wake up.

17:22.492 --> 17:26.363
It's okay. It's okay.

17:26.429 --> 17:28.632
You were just
having a bad dream.

17:28.698 --> 17:32.369
Just a bad dream,
sweetheart, that's all.

17:32.435 --> 17:33.737
I'm here.

17:54.826 --> 17:59.063
Oh God. Oh God, Christine,
what did you do?

17:59.130 --> 18:02.666
Christine, sweetheart,
what'd you do?

18:02.732 --> 18:06.070
Christine, sweetheart,
what'd you do?

18:06.137 --> 18:09.706
Christine? Christine?

18:19.482 --> 18:20.818
Good morning.

18:23.788 --> 18:25.655
I'm just gonna take
your blood pressure.

18:25.722 --> 18:28.826
Thank you.
Just lift your arm for me.

18:47.644 --> 18:50.647
Perfect. 120 over 67.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.918
And then just your pulse.

18:58.990 --> 19:00.557
Beautiful, 75.

19:00.624 --> 19:02.425
Call me if you need anything.

19:07.899 --> 19:10.001
She's awake,
you can go see her now.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.747
Tom...

20:32.649 --> 20:34.651
Edie and I
are here for you.

20:35.319 --> 20:38.956
Anything you need,
don't hesitate to ask.

20:45.930 --> 20:48.665
Has she given
any indication

20:48.732 --> 20:50.101
that she might do
something like this

20:50.167 --> 20:52.036
over the last few days?

20:58.943 --> 21:00.744
You know, Tom,
for the longest time

21:00.811 --> 21:02.980
I hoped she wouldn't
turn out like her mother.

21:04.382 --> 21:06.851
Now I realize she is
her mother's daughter.

21:12.323 --> 21:15.092
Dylan, you're not gonna
like what I'm gonna say next,

21:15.159 --> 21:19.797
but, I think it's something
that needs to be said.

21:20.931 --> 21:23.733
I think it's time you
looked into finding

21:23.801 --> 21:27.071
some sort of facility
that you can send her to,

21:27.138 --> 21:29.273
just for a little while...

21:29.340 --> 21:31.075
Dylan...

21:31.142 --> 21:32.542
Dylan...

21:45.056 --> 21:47.258
Hello?

21:47.324 --> 21:49.026
Dylan, hi, how are you?

21:49.093 --> 21:51.228
Janice, hi. Um...

21:51.295 --> 21:55.332
Janice, look, do you remember
about five years ago,

21:55.399 --> 21:58.769
I asked you to make
a dress for me?

21:58.836 --> 22:02.106
Oh, yes, I remember,
the one your mother wore.

22:02.173 --> 22:04.842
Yes, well, it turns out,

22:04.909 --> 22:07.778
Christine seems
to have misplaced it.

22:07.845 --> 22:10.881
Could you possibly make
another one for me?

22:10.948 --> 22:13.050
Let me see if I still
have the pattern, okay?

22:13.117 --> 22:14.852
Okay.

22:34.405 --> 22:37.007
And I do.
I can make it for you.

22:37.074 --> 22:38.342
Oh, great.

22:38.409 --> 22:40.077
And I'll call
you when it's done.

22:40.144 --> 22:41.245
Well, thank you so much,
you have a good day now.

22:41.312 --> 22:42.780
Thank you, you too.

22:42.847 --> 22:44.714
- All right, bye.
- Bye, Dylan.

23:12.510 --> 23:15.012
Can I help you?

23:15.079 --> 23:18.715
Hi, I'm here to see Michael
Hampton and Tyler Hull.

23:18.782 --> 23:20.117
They said they would see me.

23:20.184 --> 23:21.485
Sure,
what's your name?

23:21.552 --> 23:23.087
Rich Holstein.

23:29.026 --> 23:33.397
There's a Rich Holstein
here to see you. Great.

23:33.464 --> 23:34.731
He'll be right down.

23:34.798 --> 23:36.100
Okay. I'll just wait.

23:38.002 --> 23:39.870
So my studio manager
has been giving me

23:39.937 --> 23:41.906
a lot of heat
the last couple days,

23:41.972 --> 23:46.076
because you have been calling
him nonstop about our show.

23:48.345 --> 23:51.448
Mike, my fiancee went
missing five years ago.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.716
This happens all the time.

23:54.885 --> 23:56.754
We get a couple
of college students.

23:56.820 --> 24:00.257
They're staying up
late, they're drinkin',

24:00.324 --> 24:01.892
one thing leads to another,

24:01.959 --> 24:02.993
and they call in
our radio station,

24:03.060 --> 24:05.029
acting like they're
some murderer.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.131
They're just trying
to scare people.

24:07.198 --> 24:08.399
I mean, that's what
they did with you.

24:08.465 --> 24:10.801
I mean, they got you to believe

24:10.868 --> 24:12.436
that they murdered your fiancee.

24:12.503 --> 24:13.837
- What was her name?
- Sarah.

24:13.904 --> 24:17.007
Sarah. They made you think
that they killed Sarah.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.945
That's all it is,
a couple of shithead kids.

24:21.011 --> 24:23.380
- It's a hoax.
- I know it was him.

24:23.447 --> 24:25.349
Okay?
I'm positive it was him.

24:25.416 --> 24:27.985
I just need some help
because I know she's alive.

24:28.052 --> 24:29.453
Have you gone to
the police with this?

24:29.520 --> 24:30.454
No, no, no, I didn't
go to the police,

24:30.521 --> 24:32.223
that's why I'm here.

24:32.289 --> 24:34.925
Maybe there's a way that you guys
could triangulate the call, or...

24:34.992 --> 24:37.061
Look,
I've gotta be on in 10.

24:51.976 --> 24:53.277
Whenever you get a chance,

24:53.344 --> 24:55.745
Zach wants to see you
in his office.

25:14.298 --> 25:15.899
Come in.

25:17.668 --> 25:18.502
You wanted to see me?

25:18.569 --> 25:22.072
Take a seat, how are ya, Rich?

25:22.139 --> 25:23.407
I hate it when you
say it like that.

25:23.474 --> 25:24.508
Why?

25:24.575 --> 25:25.843
Because it makes me feel like

25:25.909 --> 25:27.211
I should be lying on a couch.

25:27.278 --> 25:29.113
Well, I'm sorry
if you're offended

25:29.179 --> 25:32.116
by my concern for
your well-being.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.985
I understand you've
taken a leave of absence.

25:35.052 --> 25:36.920
You understand correctly.

25:36.987 --> 25:40.157
How long do you intend for
this leave of absence to be?

25:40.224 --> 25:41.892
Two weeks.

25:41.959 --> 25:43.327
You sure that's how
long it's gonna be, Rich?

25:43.394 --> 25:45.262
What are you trying to say?

25:45.329 --> 25:49.133
Did I fuck up, I mean,
the reports or something?

25:49.199 --> 25:51.935
'Cause if not, I'd like to
finish my Friday in peace.

25:52.002 --> 25:54.471
Yeah, well, it's not
your work performance.

25:54.538 --> 25:56.473
It's you we're worried about.

25:56.540 --> 25:57.708
Zach, have you
ever thought that

25:57.776 --> 26:00.210
this is something that
I need to do for me?

26:00.277 --> 26:02.379
You can call me an insensitive
prick if you want to,

26:02.446 --> 26:07.284
but maybe I thought that
you could work it out here,

26:07.351 --> 26:10.321
and work it out
at home, do both.

26:11.555 --> 26:13.023
Goodbye, Zach.

26:13.957 --> 26:15.826
Rich...

26:17.094 --> 26:19.029
Rich, if you walk out of here,

26:21.365 --> 26:23.367
I'm not sure there's
gonna be anything here

26:23.434 --> 26:25.002
for you when you come back.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.938
- Goodbye, Zach.
- Rich...

26:32.242 --> 26:34.011
I think
the guy who called in

26:34.078 --> 26:36.513
may have really done
something unsavory.

26:36.580 --> 26:41.018
You know that wasn't
a fucking hoax, hmm?

26:45.222 --> 26:48.625
Look, in the '70s, a guy
called a radio station

26:48.692 --> 26:51.028
posing to be
the Zodiac killer.

26:51.095 --> 26:54.465
Yes, and the call was
traced to an insane asylum.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.100
Nevertheless,
ever since then,

26:56.166 --> 26:58.502
the police required
that every radio station

26:58.569 --> 27:00.504
have some sort of tracking
device on the sound board

27:00.571 --> 27:03.941
in case Ted Bundy or
Osama bin Laden calls in.

27:04.007 --> 27:06.009
Did you get an address?

27:07.077 --> 27:08.412
He wasn't on long enough.

27:08.479 --> 27:10.481
Mike and I tried to keep
him on the phone, you know,

27:10.547 --> 27:14.051
but, he hung up before we
could get an exact location.

27:16.086 --> 27:17.654
We were, however, able
to pinpoint the call

27:17.721 --> 27:19.890
to one general area.

27:25.629 --> 27:26.563
Do the police know about this?

27:26.630 --> 27:29.967
No monsters
in the closet, remember?

27:42.279 --> 27:46.250
This is honestly
all I can give you.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.952
Good luck.

28:25.255 --> 28:26.690
I just came back to pick up

28:26.758 --> 28:28.325
a couple of things
that I missed.

28:30.394 --> 28:31.995
I'm sorry.

28:33.163 --> 28:35.165
About the other night,
I apologize.

28:36.099 --> 28:39.169
Waiting for you
to stumble in wasted

28:39.236 --> 28:41.271
at 2 o'clock every
morning, Rich,

28:41.338 --> 28:44.508
is just not something
I can handle anymore.

28:45.542 --> 28:49.546
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

28:49.613 --> 28:51.648
Can we just forget about it?

28:52.616 --> 28:55.552
I told you not to listen
to the radio station, I...

28:55.619 --> 28:58.655
Didn't I tell you it
would fuck with your head?

28:58.722 --> 29:00.023
What do you want me to do?

29:00.090 --> 29:03.260
Do you want me to pretend
I never heard his voice,

29:03.327 --> 29:04.528
- because that was him,
- Rich, Rich, Rich...

29:04.595 --> 29:05.529
and you don't believe me.

29:05.596 --> 29:06.798
You don't believe me,

29:06.865 --> 29:09.399
- is that it?
- Rich, when is it gonna end?

29:11.668 --> 29:14.171
I don't know.

29:14.238 --> 29:16.206
It has nothing to do with us,

29:16.273 --> 29:18.275
it's just these
dreams that keep...

29:19.476 --> 29:23.480
- Always with the dreams, Rich.
- Yes.

29:23.547 --> 29:26.083
- Why don't you come inside?
- No.

29:27.684 --> 29:33.423
Did you ever think if you just
allowed yourself to be happy

29:33.490 --> 29:35.425
then maybe the
dreams would go away?

29:45.669 --> 29:47.170
Do what you need to do.

29:48.505 --> 29:53.377
Just... Just find a way
to finish this, okay?

31:23.667 --> 31:24.969
Recess!

31:39.884 --> 31:43.720
- You look...
- Like shit?

31:43.788 --> 31:44.889
Like crap?

31:44.956 --> 31:47.324
Are we not allowed
to say that either?

31:47.391 --> 31:48.760
Just wait till
you drop the F-bomb,

31:48.826 --> 31:50.995
then you can worry.

31:51.062 --> 31:53.798
Did that actually happen?

31:53.865 --> 31:54.966
It's hard to
control what you say

31:55.033 --> 31:56.566
when you drop a
textbook on your toe.

31:56.633 --> 31:58.535
Ouch.

31:58.602 --> 32:01.471
So what'd you do for their
silence, bribe them with candy?

32:01.538 --> 32:03.273
Luckily, only a couple
of them heard me

32:03.340 --> 32:05.843
and they both like me, so...

32:05.910 --> 32:07.411
Some of them like you?

32:07.477 --> 32:08.645
Yeah, can you believe it?

32:08.712 --> 32:09.781
I can't.

32:12.884 --> 32:15.452
So how's...

32:17.855 --> 32:20.657
- Peter?
- Peter, yeah.

32:20.724 --> 32:22.325
How is he?

32:23.593 --> 32:27.330
He's, good.

32:28.699 --> 32:31.334
Good, good.

32:31.401 --> 32:33.704
Oh, God.

32:33.771 --> 32:35.006
Yeah, go.

32:35.073 --> 32:37.541
Are you okay? Are you okay?

32:37.607 --> 32:42.612
Come on. Come on, let's go
to the office.

32:54.491 --> 32:58.963
Remember, the subject is
what is doing the action

32:59.030 --> 33:00.564
in the sentence.

33:00.630 --> 33:03.400
The actual action
is the predicate,

33:03.467 --> 33:05.736
that is what
the subject is doing.

33:05.803 --> 33:10.574
The object of the action
is called the direct object,

33:10.640 --> 33:15.278
it is receiving what
the subject is doing, okay?

33:16.379 --> 33:18.248
Circle the direct object.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.854
Come on, Lisa.
You can do this.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.822
No, I can't.

33:24.889 --> 33:26.023
Why not?

33:26.090 --> 33:27.792
Because I'm stupid.

33:28.926 --> 33:31.095
You are not stupid.

33:31.162 --> 33:32.662
I don't wanna hear you say that.

33:32.729 --> 33:34.766
You are not stupid.

33:34.832 --> 33:36.633
Who says that you're stupid?

33:36.700 --> 33:38.335
My daddy.

33:41.806 --> 33:44.474
Well, I'm sure your
daddy doesn't mean it.

33:44.541 --> 33:46.710
Can I go home with you,
Mr. Beaufort?

33:48.012 --> 33:51.015
No, you
can't go home with me.

33:51.082 --> 33:53.885
You gotta go home with
your mommy and daddy.

33:53.951 --> 33:55.820
I don't wanna go home.

33:57.121 --> 33:59.322
How come you
don't wanna go home?

33:59.991 --> 34:01.793
I just don't.

34:36.027 --> 34:37.394
You're still here?

34:37.460 --> 34:39.529
So are you.

34:43.768 --> 34:45.535
I told him I was
gonna see my sister

34:45.602 --> 34:47.404
in the city for the weekend.

34:48.806 --> 34:50.340
I left an hour ago.

34:55.780 --> 34:58.615
So why don't you ever eat
in the teacher's lounge?

35:00.550 --> 35:02.186
Bunch of 40-somethings
laughing over

35:02.253 --> 35:05.455
which of their kids are
gonna wind up in jail first,

35:05.522 --> 35:07.657
it gets kinda depressing
after a while.

35:08.793 --> 35:11.461
Besides, I guess I like
comfortable silences.

35:12.163 --> 35:13.898
I can see that.

35:14.966 --> 35:16.533
What do ya mean?

35:17.500 --> 35:19.070
I mean, this whole
setup you got here.

35:19.136 --> 35:21.105
It's kinda perfect
for that.

35:21.172 --> 35:23.373
Yeah, I guess.

35:24.842 --> 35:26.911
So why'd you wanna
be a teacher?

35:28.612 --> 35:30.714
Why, is there something
else I should be doing?

35:31.648 --> 35:34.118
I dunno.
Something bigger.

35:34.185 --> 35:35.987
Something that
makes a lot of money.

35:36.053 --> 35:38.655
Something that makes
more than what we get.

35:40.024 --> 35:41.158
You know,
I came from money.

35:43.526 --> 35:45.997
And I bet they remind
you of that every day.

35:47.697 --> 35:50.667
Actually, my father walked
out on me when I was two.

35:51.568 --> 35:54.839
And my mother committed suicide
my senior year in college.

35:56.073 --> 35:57.674
Oh, my God.

35:58.943 --> 36:01.411
I'm so sorry.

36:03.948 --> 36:06.951
Fortunately,
I had a trust fund to fall back on.

36:07.985 --> 36:09.452
I was an only child.

36:10.087 --> 36:11.956
Got my master's.

36:12.023 --> 36:13.824
Found this old place.

36:15.126 --> 36:16.827
After everything that happened,

36:17.727 --> 36:20.932
the simple life seemed like
the most attractive one.

36:21.966 --> 36:24.467
Simple lives aren't
always happy ones.

36:36.613 --> 36:38.049
Wait...

36:39.183 --> 36:40.550
What?

36:40.617 --> 36:42.719
I wanna
watch you undress.

36:43.854 --> 36:46.190
There's a white dress
in the bathroom.

36:46.991 --> 36:49.160
I saw it in a store
window a few weeks ago,

36:49.226 --> 36:50.694
and I thought you'd look
amazing in it.

36:50.761 --> 36:53.630
I want you to go into the
bathroom, put the dress on,

36:53.697 --> 36:56.533
and then come out here
and strip out of it for me.

36:57.134 --> 36:58.869
Okay.

38:49.146 --> 38:50.580
Sarah?

38:57.088 --> 38:59.722
Sarah?

39:03.994 --> 39:05.728
Sarah?

39:10.201 --> 39:11.601
Sarah?

39:20.444 --> 39:21.879
Sarah!

39:23.481 --> 39:24.982
Sarah!

41:46.156 --> 41:47.124
Thank you.

41:47.191 --> 41:48.859
- Good luck, Christine.
- Bye.

41:51.629 --> 41:53.831
Did you buy the dress?

41:53.897 --> 41:55.332
I did a bit more than that.

42:00.537 --> 42:01.572
Do you think I'm lying?

42:01.639 --> 42:04.308
Mr. Holstein...

42:06.277 --> 42:08.979
Okay, I just need you
to listen to this.

42:09.680 --> 42:13.250
Okay? I need you
to listen to this recording.

42:13.317 --> 42:15.519
It's a guy that
lives around here.

42:15.586 --> 42:18.555
Mr. Holstein...

42:18.622 --> 42:20.591
Please, would
you just listen to this?

42:20.658 --> 42:25.796
Look, this is a nice,
clean-cut town.

42:26.397 --> 42:29.199
What exactly are you
expecting to find here?

42:30.467 --> 42:34.938
I just need you
to listen to this. Please.

42:37.207 --> 42:38.242
Please.

42:39.376 --> 42:41.845
If I get a minute,
I'll let you know.

42:46.250 --> 42:47.418
Thank you.

43:39.703 --> 43:42.072
Hello?

43:42.139 --> 43:43.240
Yeah?

43:45.676 --> 43:47.077
What do ya want?

43:49.513 --> 43:51.248
You need
some work done or...?

43:51.315 --> 43:52.449
No, I...

43:52.516 --> 43:55.052
My sister, she has
this golden retriever,

43:55.119 --> 43:56.353
she has a red tag,

43:56.420 --> 43:57.789
I don't know if you saw
her around the area...

43:57.856 --> 44:00.023
- You think I took your dog?
- No, I'm not saying that.

44:00.090 --> 44:01.392
Maybe you just saw it
around the area...

44:01.458 --> 44:03.193
Get the fuck off my property.

44:59.349 --> 45:01.418
<i>No, I mean
like, actually in my seat.</i>

45:01.485 --> 45:03.086
<i>Like,
I used a coat as a cover,</i>

45:03.153 --> 45:04.555
<i>and there's a girl
sleeping next to me, so...</i>

45:04.621 --> 45:07.057
<i>Oh, dear God, Anthony,</i>

45:07.124 --> 45:08.592
<i>I feel like there
is another show</i>

45:08.659 --> 45:10.027
<i>that you should be
calling right now.</i>

45:10.093 --> 45:12.262
<i>Hey, Anthony, Anthony,</i>

45:12.329 --> 45:14.031
<i>I gotta ask you a question</i>

45:14.097 --> 45:16.300
<i>or I'm gonna die of just
curiosity here on this one.</i>

45:16.366 --> 45:19.536
<i>Um, how old was the girl
you were sitting next to?</i>

45:19.603 --> 45:21.438
<i>Hmm. I think
she was about like 15 or...</i>

45:21.505 --> 45:24.508
<i>Whoa, and that is
the end of that conversation.</i>

45:24.575 --> 45:27.444
<i>Thanks for calling in, Pee Wee.</i>

45:27.511 --> 45:29.814
- <i>Who else we got?</i>
- <i>All right, let's see.</i>

45:29.881 --> 45:32.382
<i>Line three, we have
Dean from Brooklyn.</i>

45:32.449 --> 45:34.318
<i>What'd ya do, Dean?</i>

45:36.487 --> 45:37.721
<i>You there, Dean?</i>

45:37.789 --> 45:39.189
<i>Dean?</i>

45:39.256 --> 45:41.124
<i>Oh, Dean, hello?</i>

45:42.192 --> 45:43.393
<i>Yeah, this is Dean.</i>

45:43.460 --> 45:45.596
<i>Oh,
I'm already intrigued.</i>

45:45.662 --> 45:47.631
<i>You gonna confess
your crime, Dean?</i>

45:47.698 --> 45:50.267
<i>The suspense is killing us.</i>

45:51.134 --> 45:52.937
<i>I met a girl
at a club one night.</i>

45:53.003 --> 45:56.473
<i>Okay, now you've
definitely got our attention.</i>

45:56.540 --> 45:58.843
<i>She came back
to my house with me,</i>

45:58.910 --> 46:01.144
<i>and we started
to have sex.</i>

46:02.246 --> 46:04.114
<i>Okay, I don't think...</i>

46:04.181 --> 46:06.617
<i>I wanna
cut you off Dean,</i>

46:06.683 --> 46:09.553
<i>but I just can't bring
myself to hit the button.</i>

46:11.655 --> 46:13.090
<i>What happened next?</i>

46:15.425 --> 46:17.227
<i>Well, things
went fine at first,</i>

46:17.294 --> 46:21.164
<i>but then things started
to get a little rough.</i>

46:21.833 --> 46:24.501
<i>She didn't like that very much.</i>

46:24.568 --> 46:26.069
<i>She wanted to leave.</i>

46:29.339 --> 46:31.508
<i>Then what?</i>

46:31.575 --> 46:34.745
<i>Well, as you can imagine,
I was pretty upset. I...</i>

46:34.812 --> 46:37.447
<i>I started to hit her.</i>

46:37.514 --> 46:39.216
<i>You beat her up?</i>

46:40.284 --> 46:41.886
<i>Yeah, I...</i>

46:41.953 --> 46:45.455
<i>No, I... I don't...
I don't think she made it.</i>

46:48.692 --> 46:53.263
<i>Dean, did you kill her?</i>

46:54.197 --> 46:56.567
<i>I... I dunno, I...</i>

46:57.734 --> 46:59.871
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I did.</i>

46:59.938 --> 47:01.672
<i>I know I did.</i>

47:03.273 --> 47:05.810
<i>How long
ago was this, Dean?</i>

47:05.877 --> 47:09.513
<i>I dunno, maybe, I
dunno, about five years ago.</i>

47:12.616 --> 47:15.285
<i>Dean, have you told
anyone else about this?</i>

47:15.352 --> 47:17.588
<i>No, no, look,
I really gotta go.</i>

47:17.654 --> 47:20.290
<i>I'm sorry. Goodbye.</i>

47:55.459 --> 47:56.526
Hey...

48:02.532 --> 48:04.534
Can I just ask you one thing?

48:06.838 --> 48:08.338
What makes you so sure that

48:08.405 --> 48:11.274
this is gonna work
this time around?

48:12.476 --> 48:14.411
Doesn't really
matter, does it?

48:24.956 --> 48:27.257
Chocolate chip pancakes?

48:27.825 --> 48:29.426
Sure.

48:46.778 --> 48:47.678
Stay in this room.

48:47.744 --> 48:50.580
- What?
- Don't come out.

49:17.441 --> 49:20.277
Tom! How are you?

49:20.978 --> 49:22.412
It's good to see you, Dylan.

49:22.479 --> 49:24.247
It's good to see you, too.

49:24.949 --> 49:27.819
Um, can we talk for a bit?

49:28.953 --> 49:29.887
Could we talk out here?

49:29.954 --> 49:32.556
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Okay.

49:32.622 --> 49:35.425
You get smaller
every time I see you.

49:35.492 --> 49:37.762
What's Edie been feeding you?

49:37.829 --> 49:39.296
A lot of the green stuff.

49:40.630 --> 49:44.634
Um, I got something to ask you.

49:44.701 --> 49:45.770
Okay.

49:47.004 --> 49:48.039
Where's, uh...

49:48.106 --> 49:49.774
Oh, she's upstairs sleeping.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.642
Make sure she
gets plenty of that.

49:52.709 --> 49:53.744
I will.

49:53.811 --> 49:55.746
And make sure she gets
plenty of fresh air.

49:55.813 --> 49:57.447
Yeah.

49:57.514 --> 49:59.851
You're both gonna
get through this.

49:59.917 --> 50:01.551
You would know.

50:01.618 --> 50:02.820
I would.

50:04.055 --> 50:05.522
Um...

50:06.858 --> 50:08.258
How are ya?

50:11.829 --> 50:13.530
I'm doin'.

50:16.533 --> 50:18.535
You're a strong man,
Dylan.

50:19.871 --> 50:22.739
I've known you since you
were just a little boy.

50:24.541 --> 50:26.409
I remember driving by
your mother's house

50:26.476 --> 50:28.880
and seeing you sitting on
the porch eating ice cream.

50:28.946 --> 50:30.882
I'd wave and you'd wave back.

50:34.551 --> 50:37.454
When I think of all the
things you've been through...

50:40.557 --> 50:44.028
Tom, you're creeping the
hell out of me right now.

50:44.095 --> 50:45.763
Whatever this is,
out with it.

50:47.965 --> 50:50.600
It's, it's idiotic.

50:50.667 --> 50:51.836
Tom...

50:54.437 --> 50:56.506
All right, look.

50:56.573 --> 50:58.542
Fella came to the station,

50:58.608 --> 51:01.711
real crazy-lookin' fella
came to the station.

51:04.115 --> 51:05.348
I'm sure you got a lot

51:05.415 --> 51:07.450
of crazy-looking fellas
coming to the station.

51:07.517 --> 51:10.054
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

51:10.988 --> 51:17.561
Anyway, apparently, there's
this cockamamie radio station

51:17.627 --> 51:19.997
in New York City where
people can call in

51:20.064 --> 51:22.465
and confess what
crimes they've done.

51:23.733 --> 51:27.872
And, this crazy-lookin'
fella's got a recording

51:27.939 --> 51:32.009
of somebody confessing
to taking a girl home

51:32.076 --> 51:34.744
and raping and murdering her.

51:37.747 --> 51:40.517
The crazy fella thinks
it's his fiancee

51:40.584 --> 51:42.586
who disappeared five years ago.

51:43.955 --> 51:45.589
And?

51:49.827 --> 51:55.599
And, the voice
on the recording,

51:58.501 --> 52:00.570
well, I'd be less than honest

52:00.637 --> 52:03.941
if I didn't say it
sounded like you.

52:08.212 --> 52:10.747
What are you saying, Tom?

52:15.086 --> 52:16.620
I don't know.

52:22.793 --> 52:24.728
Tom, haven't I
suffered enough?

52:26.197 --> 52:27.999
Haven't you seen me
suffer enough?

52:30.533 --> 52:33.971
For you to come over here,
and even suggest

52:34.038 --> 52:36.974
that I could be capable of
doing something like that.

52:38.209 --> 52:39.643
What's wrong with you?

52:40.945 --> 52:42.679
I don't know.

52:44.081 --> 52:47.484
I don't know.

52:47.550 --> 52:49.987
You're right.

52:51.621 --> 52:53.758
You're absolutely right.

52:55.159 --> 52:57.995
I don't suppose the voice
on the recording sounded

52:58.062 --> 52:59.897
anything like you after all.

53:00.697 --> 53:04.434
At my age, I can hardly
hear anything anymore.

53:10.274 --> 53:14.711
I'm sorry, Dylan.
I'm really sorry.

53:17.248 --> 53:20.117
It's okay. It's okay.

53:20.184 --> 53:23.788
I don't want you to give
this another moment's thought.

53:23.854 --> 53:27.657
I won't, and I don't
want you to, either.

53:27.724 --> 53:28.960
I won't.

53:30.161 --> 53:34.298
Well, I guess I better go on.

53:34.365 --> 53:37.600
Got a lot more crazy-lookin'
fellas to deal with.

53:37.667 --> 53:40.537
Ones not accusing
me of murder, I hope?

53:40.603 --> 53:44.741
No, I think we've had
enough of that for one day.

53:48.012 --> 53:49.013
Tom?

53:54.185 --> 53:58.122
You and Edie enjoy that
blueberry pie I baked for you?

53:58.189 --> 53:59.757
We ate every crumb.

54:33.924 --> 54:37.594
<i>Dean,
did you kill her?</i>

54:39.797 --> 54:41.832
<i>I dunno, I...</i>

54:43.200 --> 54:46.003
<i>Yeah, Yeah, I did.</i>

54:46.070 --> 54:47.138
<i>I know I did.</i>

54:51.208 --> 54:53.643
<i>How long
ago was this, Dean?</i>

54:53.710 --> 54:58.015
<i>I dunno, maybe, I dunno,
about five years ago.</i>

54:58.082 --> 54:59.350
<i>Dean, Dean,</i>

54:59.417 --> 55:00.918
<i>um, have you told anyone
else about this?</i>

55:00.985 --> 55:04.188
<i>No, no, look,
I really gotta go.</i>

55:04.255 --> 55:07.091
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Goodbye.</i>

55:07.158 --> 55:10.560
<i>Dean...</i>

56:42.820 --> 56:44.188
Who are you?

56:46.190 --> 56:47.224
I'm Rich.

56:48.459 --> 56:50.394
You didn't knock.

56:50.461 --> 56:51.929
The door was open.

56:53.998 --> 56:55.132
I thought that you were him

56:55.199 --> 56:57.234
and if I didn't answer
you would go away.

57:01.338 --> 57:04.642
No, no, don't turn on
the freaking light!

57:05.476 --> 57:08.745
If you turn the light on, he's
gonna know that we're here!

57:10.114 --> 57:13.083
You can't turn the
light on, he's gonna see us.

57:14.852 --> 57:15.986
There's no one outside.

57:16.053 --> 57:17.855
Yes there is.

57:17.922 --> 57:20.090
I know, I know that
there's somebody outside.

57:21.392 --> 57:23.227
Can you sit next to me,
please?

57:23.294 --> 57:27.198
Just... sit next to me?

57:27.264 --> 57:29.066
Is it okay?

57:33.470 --> 57:35.105
You're alone?

57:36.373 --> 57:37.641
- Yes.
- Okay.

57:41.378 --> 57:45.249
All right, maybe we should
go to the cops right now.

57:45.316 --> 57:46.784
No, we can't go right now.

57:46.850 --> 57:48.085
We'll do it when
it's light outside.

57:48.152 --> 57:49.386
We can go when
it's light outside,

57:49.453 --> 57:50.387
we can't go when it's dark.

57:50.454 --> 57:51.555
- We should...
- No, please,

57:51.622 --> 57:52.923
just stay with me.

57:52.990 --> 57:58.229
No, stay with me until
it's light outside, please!

57:58.295 --> 57:59.129
Okay, okay.

57:59.196 --> 58:00.531
Just wait with me.

58:00.598 --> 58:03.267
Will you wait with me?

58:03.334 --> 58:05.169
Just hold me, please.

58:07.871 --> 58:13.010
Okay.

58:23.153 --> 58:25.923
The light...

58:25.990 --> 58:28.158
It's all right. Hey...

58:30.127 --> 58:31.328
The light needs to be on.

58:31.395 --> 58:34.064
He can feel us in the dark.

58:34.131 --> 58:36.467
He knows the dark, the light...

58:36.533 --> 58:38.235
You said
it needed to be off.

58:38.302 --> 58:42.106
No, but he knows the dark,
he can find us,

58:42.172 --> 58:44.875
I can feel
that he's out there.

58:57.655 --> 58:59.857
Do you wanna fuck me?

59:06.697 --> 59:08.899
What's wrong, do you not
think I'm pretty?

59:13.604 --> 59:17.007
No, you're beautiful.

59:17.074 --> 59:19.376
So do you wanna fuck me?

59:25.182 --> 59:28.819
Yes, yes.

1:00:53.137 --> 1:00:56.507
He used to hold me like
this when I had nightmares,

1:00:56.573 --> 1:00:58.041
and then they'd go away.

1:01:01.211 --> 1:01:04.314
And then he stopped holding me
and they came back.

1:01:11.188 --> 1:01:12.489
Do you have bad dreams?

1:01:14.591 --> 1:01:15.959
Yes.

1:01:20.597 --> 1:01:22.266
What's the worst one?

1:01:28.071 --> 1:01:33.310
I put a necklace
on this girl...

1:01:35.446 --> 1:01:37.714
in front of a mirror.

1:01:37.782 --> 1:01:42.119
That doesn't sound
like a bad dream.

1:01:47.090 --> 1:01:50.795
The last day I saw Sarah,

1:01:50.862 --> 1:01:55.499
I put a necklace on her,
in front of a mirror.

1:01:59.736 --> 1:02:02.105
That was five years ago,

1:02:05.877 --> 1:02:08.579
and the dreams just don't stop.

1:02:08.645 --> 1:02:10.047
Maybe if you had the necklace

1:02:10.113 --> 1:02:12.149
the bad dreams would go away.

1:02:13.383 --> 1:02:16.019
Yes, yes.

1:02:18.689 --> 1:02:20.190
Maybe you'll find the necklace

1:02:20.257 --> 1:02:23.494
and the bad dreams
will go away then.

1:02:27.130 --> 1:02:29.233
I don't wanna dream this.

1:02:29.299 --> 1:02:32.302
I don't wanna
dream this anymore.

1:02:35.572 --> 1:02:37.207
Will you help me?

1:02:38.475 --> 1:02:40.444
Will you help me?

1:02:43.514 --> 1:02:44.581
Please?

1:02:45.716 --> 1:02:47.150
Please?

1:03:05.335 --> 1:03:08.338
My name is Dylan Beaufort.

1:03:08.405 --> 1:03:10.274
I'm the man you're looking for.

1:03:15.712 --> 1:03:17.047
Where's Christine?

1:03:18.348 --> 1:03:20.183
She went back to the house.

1:03:21.652 --> 1:03:23.387
You used her
to lure me?

1:03:24.756 --> 1:03:26.189
Yes.

1:03:29.393 --> 1:03:31.061
Why didn't you kill me?

1:03:32.729 --> 1:03:34.464
Because the game's
changed now.

1:03:37.401 --> 1:03:38.468
In what way?

1:03:40.671 --> 1:03:44.207
I think I know how I can
make your bad dreams go away.

1:03:45.509 --> 1:03:48.345
But here is not the time
or the place to tell you.

1:03:51.281 --> 1:03:52.549
I'll give you till the morning,

1:03:52.616 --> 1:03:55.185
and then I'll be
waiting for you outside.

1:04:28.418 --> 1:04:31.688
I think it would be
better if I drove.

1:04:33.925 --> 1:04:36.193
Did I not already say that
if I wanted to kill you

1:04:36.259 --> 1:04:37.694
I would have done it already?

1:04:39.764 --> 1:04:41.164
I'm here to help you.

1:05:05.455 --> 1:05:08.225
Do you know the story
of "Hansel and Gretel?"

1:05:08.291 --> 1:05:09.593
What?

1:05:09.660 --> 1:05:12.629
The Brothers Grimm
fairy tale "Hansel and Gretel,"

1:05:12.696 --> 1:05:14.164
do you know it?

1:05:14.966 --> 1:05:16.433
Yes.

1:05:18.535 --> 1:05:22.205
Well, in the version that I
know, the one that I prefer,

1:05:23.841 --> 1:05:26.811
while Hansel and Gretel are
trapped in the witch's house,

1:05:26.878 --> 1:05:30.414
the father back home realizes
he's made a terrible mistake.

1:05:31.983 --> 1:05:34.651
He tries to go back into
the woods to get them,

1:05:34.718 --> 1:05:36.988
the mother stops him.

1:05:37.055 --> 1:05:40.557
He kills her,
goes back into the woods,

1:05:40.624 --> 1:05:44.594
finds Hansel and Gretel,
and he brings them home.

1:05:57.108 --> 1:05:58.608
Let's start with
a man and a woman

1:05:58.675 --> 1:06:01.344
who don't teach
their daughter love,

1:06:01.411 --> 1:06:04.548
but do teach her that
no one can be trusted.

1:06:05.883 --> 1:06:09.352
That daughter grows up to be
a woman incapable of love,

1:06:09.419 --> 1:06:12.355
who drives away the father
of her two children,

1:06:12.422 --> 1:06:13.623
a son and a daughter,

1:06:14.859 --> 1:06:17.728
a woman incapable of letting
anyone into her heart.

1:06:20.098 --> 1:06:22.033
And when there was
no man to satisfy

1:06:22.100 --> 1:06:23.801
the needs
that all woman have,

1:06:25.435 --> 1:06:27.471
turned to her two
children for them.

1:06:32.810 --> 1:06:35.345
The both of you?

1:06:35.412 --> 1:06:37.547
Some nights it was me.

1:06:37.614 --> 1:06:39.817
Other nights
it was Christine.

1:06:41.384 --> 1:06:43.687
I guess
we felt at the time

1:06:43.755 --> 1:06:47.724
that it was our responsibility,
like a chore, almost.

1:06:49.493 --> 1:06:52.462
I guess that's how kids think
in situations like that.

1:06:53.697 --> 1:06:54.799
Yeah.

1:06:56.868 --> 1:06:58.502
How long did that go on for?

1:06:59.971 --> 1:07:02.807
Really wasn't the kind
of thing we kept track of.

1:07:03.875 --> 1:07:06.676
Minutes turn into centuries
in times like that.

1:07:08.678 --> 1:07:11.615
But it did stop for
a while when he came.

1:07:23.493 --> 1:07:25.529
We're off in
a little while, guys.

1:07:25.595 --> 1:07:27.497
We don't have to be
there for another hour.

1:07:27.564 --> 1:07:29.466
Your mom wants us to be early.

1:07:29.533 --> 1:07:31.601
And we're gonna
meet her there.

1:07:31.668 --> 1:07:33.104
It's good to see
one person excited

1:07:33.171 --> 1:07:35.505
for one of mother's
socialite freak shows.

1:07:35.572 --> 1:07:39.409
It's a charity event
and it means a lot to her,

1:07:39.476 --> 1:07:42.579
so let's try to put on
a good face, all right?

1:07:43.214 --> 1:07:44.414
What's her problem?

1:07:44.481 --> 1:07:46.516
I told her there'd be
dancing at this event.

1:07:46.583 --> 1:07:48.385
So what's the big deal?

1:07:48.451 --> 1:07:50.054
She doesn't
know how to slow dance.

1:07:50.121 --> 1:07:51.889
Shut up, Dylan.

1:07:55.927 --> 1:07:59.462
You said we have another hour
before we have to go, right?

1:08:00.064 --> 1:08:01.531
Yeah.

1:08:01.598 --> 1:08:03.700
I think this gives us
enough time.

1:08:04.568 --> 1:08:07.571
Christine Beaufort,
may I have this dance?

1:08:09.006 --> 1:08:12.810
Okay, we're gonna start with
a simple step-touch motion.

1:08:12.877 --> 1:08:16.513
Step-touch,
step-touch, step-touch.

1:08:16.580 --> 1:08:18.015
Come on, do it with me.

1:08:18.082 --> 1:08:20.084
Just glide, glide with me.

1:08:20.151 --> 1:08:23.687
Step-touch,
step-touch, step-touch.

1:08:23.753 --> 1:08:26.690
That's it.
Now, give me your hand.

1:08:26.757 --> 1:08:29.492
Like that, and just
back-and-forth,

1:08:29.559 --> 1:08:32.529
step-touch, step-touch...

1:08:35.766 --> 1:08:38.435
We played Greg and
Marsha Brady for him,

1:08:38.501 --> 1:08:40.503
so he would never
suspect anything.

1:08:42.106 --> 1:08:45.343
I took him aside one night
and I told him everything.

1:08:47.078 --> 1:08:48.745
He was gone the next morning.

1:08:49.847 --> 1:08:54.451
No note, no phone call,
he didn't even pack.

1:08:55.719 --> 1:08:56.854
A son and a daughter
left with a mother

1:08:56.921 --> 1:08:59.422
who couldn't deal
with it a second time.

1:09:00.557 --> 1:09:02.193
A mother who took her
own way out with a razor

1:09:02.260 --> 1:09:05.395
and a tub full of water.

1:09:06.063 --> 1:09:07.497
Bleeding out in a bathtub

1:09:07.564 --> 1:09:09.532
is a relatively
painless way to die.

1:09:10.935 --> 1:09:13.905
She never got the execution
that she deserved.

1:09:15.039 --> 1:09:16.874
It was at that moment
that I realized

1:09:16.941 --> 1:09:20.011
I had to give Christine
the execution she never got.

1:09:21.312 --> 1:09:23.647
Everything was planned
down to the last detail.

1:09:23.713 --> 1:09:25.149
Nothing could be overlooked.

1:09:25.216 --> 1:09:28.551
The suit he wore,
the dress she wore,

1:09:28.618 --> 1:09:31.856
the razor she used,
the song...

1:09:36.693 --> 1:09:38.695
I was about to leave
when I saw her.

1:09:39.864 --> 1:09:42.833
We had some drinks,
we talked about you,

1:09:43.801 --> 1:09:46.938
and then I asked her to come
back to my place with me.

1:09:47.004 --> 1:09:49.006
She came willingly.

1:09:55.246 --> 1:09:57.815
The rest was clockwork.

1:10:18.202 --> 1:10:19.669
If it's any consolation at all,

1:10:19.736 --> 1:10:22.073
I made it as quick as I could.

1:10:22.139 --> 1:10:24.308
Why'd you
call the radio station?

1:10:27.878 --> 1:10:29.313
Oh, who knows?

1:10:29.380 --> 1:10:32.749
Maybe it was the last lingering
thread of guilt left in me

1:10:32.817 --> 1:10:36.619
or the perverse idea of
being able to tell everyone

1:10:36.686 --> 1:10:38.688
and no one at the same time.

1:10:40.858 --> 1:10:42.960
Or maybe I called
so that you'd listen.

1:10:44.996 --> 1:10:48.232
It was meant to be for me
to run into Sarah that night,

1:10:48.299 --> 1:10:50.700
just as it's meant to be that

1:10:50.768 --> 1:10:53.070
you and I are in this
car together now.

1:10:56.740 --> 1:10:58.708
You know, for a while
I wondered why

1:10:58.776 --> 1:11:01.711
it didn't work
the first time.

1:11:01.779 --> 1:11:04.815
At first I thought it was
because Sarah was too young.

1:11:07.184 --> 1:11:09.086
But now I realize

1:11:09.153 --> 1:11:11.989
it never should have been
me holding the razor.

1:11:14.425 --> 1:11:15.893
An actor can't be an actor

1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:17.727
and a spectator
at the same time.

1:11:20.031 --> 1:11:24.601
I need to sit next to
Christine and hold her hand

1:11:24.667 --> 1:11:26.736
while someone else
holds the razor.

1:11:28.105 --> 1:11:31.876
We have the evil mother,
now we need the good father.

1:11:35.946 --> 1:11:37.915
Christ...

1:11:49.460 --> 1:11:51.896
How do I know you still
have the necklace?

1:11:54.231 --> 1:11:57.968
Silver pearl, steel chain,
diamond shavings.

1:11:59.904 --> 1:12:02.807
I was gonna give it to
Christine on her wedding day.

1:12:03.974 --> 1:12:06.709
I know,
go figure, right?

1:12:08.946 --> 1:12:10.915
Why is it
so important to you?

1:12:15.786 --> 1:12:17.720
Because he was
the good father.

1:12:18.856 --> 1:12:20.191
He was the one who
was supposed to come

1:12:20.257 --> 1:12:22.592
and take us out of the woods.
