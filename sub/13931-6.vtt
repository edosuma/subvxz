00:01.916 --> 00:04.628
- Oh, my God!
- "Dharma Bums"?

00:04.629 --> 00:06.755
It was given to me by someone
I loved very much.

00:06.756 --> 00:08.966
Last night, I saw these
people... down by the lake.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.111
They were wearing these masks.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.467
Jack Sykes. This belonged to my father.

00:11.468 --> 00:12.677
He was doing the same thing we are.

00:12.678 --> 00:14.012
You should keep your eyes open.

00:14.013 --> 00:15.346
'Cause bear traps aren't the only thing

00:15.347 --> 00:16.764
- we should be worried about.
- Whoa.

00:16.765 --> 00:18.433
- Where's your camera?
- It doesn't work here.

00:18.434 --> 00:21.352
Kill Amy, or someone else will die.

00:21.353 --> 00:23.354
‐ So you're gonna go meet
him? ‐ Gotta give it a shot.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

00:49.630 --> 00:51.631
‐ Slow down! ‐ Oh, I can't.

00:51.632 --> 00:53.507
Miles to go before I sleep.

00:53.508 --> 00:56.385
Are we really doing this?

00:56.386 --> 00:57.678
What, are you kidding?

00:57.679 --> 00:59.764
Kerouac and Ginsburg buried one

00:59.765 --> 01:01.724
under a bar in San Francisco.

01:01.725 --> 01:04.227
But nobody really knows which one.

01:04.227 --> 01:05.563
Not even them.

01:06.020 --> 01:08.398
Our own personal time capsule.

01:12.902 --> 01:15.195
"Deb, it's never too late to be

01:15.196 --> 01:17.240
the person you were always meant to be."

01:18.783 --> 01:20.659
I don't know if I can part with this.

01:20.660 --> 01:22.536
There's no choice. We have to.

01:22.537 --> 01:24.175
Look, if you keep it, you might lose it.

01:24.455 --> 01:27.206
This way, if we ever
want this summer back,

01:27.207 --> 01:29.334
we'll know exactly where to find it.

01:33.881 --> 01:35.548
I want to show you something.

01:39.927 --> 01:42.387
- You see that?
- Mm‐hmm.

01:42.388 --> 01:43.931
That's Canis Major.

01:46.182 --> 01:47.891
That's Orion's pet dog.

01:47.892 --> 01:50.519
He's chasing her.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.438
Who's that?

01:52.439 --> 01:55.232
Oh, that's Hare.

01:55.233 --> 01:59.403
See, Hare, she's always on the run.

01:59.404 --> 02:02.072
Always searching for her one true love.

02:02.073 --> 02:06.535
But Orion's dog, he's not
hunting her to kill her.

02:06.536 --> 02:09.913
He loves her. He is her one true love.

02:09.913 --> 02:12.542
She just doesn't know it yet.

02:13.375 --> 02:15.752
I can't believe it's
the last night of camp.

02:15.753 --> 02:17.086
And then...

02:17.087 --> 02:19.297
it's over.

02:19.298 --> 02:22.133
Three weeks college.

02:22.134 --> 02:24.135
Come with me.

02:24.136 --> 02:24.853
What?

02:25.007 --> 02:26.555
I'm going to travel the world.

02:27.639 --> 02:29.598
We'll go everywhere, see everything.

02:29.599 --> 02:31.725
What, so I get to be sidekick
while you write novels

02:31.726 --> 02:33.394
and become the next Richard Brautigan.

02:33.395 --> 02:34.983
Well, if I can, yeah.

02:35.141 --> 02:36.105
Let's do it together.

02:36.107 --> 02:37.271
That sounds great.

02:37.272 --> 02:41.067
But you want to see the world, Keith.

02:41.068 --> 02:44.070
I think I'm going to try and save it.

02:44.071 --> 02:45.824
You have to promise
to send me a postcard

02:45.958 --> 02:48.282
from everywhere you go.

02:48.283 --> 02:49.925
Let's promise each other

02:50.042 --> 02:52.097
we'll never stop being the Dharma Bums.

02:52.245 --> 02:54.454
We'll never give up on our dreams, okay?

02:54.455 --> 02:57.374
It's not like you're
gonna be gone forever, right?

02:57.375 --> 03:00.961
Stay sharp, kid.

03:00.962 --> 03:04.631
You never know when I might come
walking through the door.

03:30.073 --> 03:33.242
Uh... So if, um...

03:33.243 --> 03:36.162
If you need to call your parents

03:36.163 --> 03:40.791
or your campers need anyone,

03:40.792 --> 03:42.209
um...

03:42.210 --> 03:44.545
there's a phone in my office,

03:44.546 --> 03:47.548
and you're welcome to use it any time.

03:47.549 --> 03:50.551
Um, no activities today.

03:50.552 --> 03:54.221
I think that we all need some time.

03:54.222 --> 03:57.391
So, um... take care of each other.

03:57.392 --> 04:00.395
Thanks.

04:12.991 --> 04:16.327
- How you holding up?
- Um...

04:16.327 --> 04:18.661
Better than them.

04:18.663 --> 04:21.916
Deputy Sykes wanted
me to tell you that...

04:21.916 --> 04:24.376
he's done taking statements.

04:24.377 --> 04:27.088
I guess they're ruling it a...

04:27.089 --> 04:29.924
- accident, but...
- Of course it was.

04:29.925 --> 04:32.051
This was all my fault.

04:32.052 --> 04:34.720
I had a perfect summer 19 years ago.

04:34.721 --> 04:37.098
I wanted that for all of you.

04:37.099 --> 04:39.600
But it was a mistake
to reopen this camp.

04:39.601 --> 04:41.227
No, you did the right thing.

04:41.228 --> 04:42.228
Yeah.

04:42.229 --> 04:44.480
It was.

04:44.481 --> 04:46.732
If I had left the past the past,

04:46.733 --> 04:48.944
Cricket would still be alive.

05:06.628 --> 05:09.172
Hello?

05:31.444 --> 05:33.821
I told you to stay sharp, kid.

05:33.822 --> 05:35.281
Keith.

05:39.035 --> 05:42.037
I can't believe you dug
this up without me.

05:42.038 --> 05:45.083
Long time no see, Dharma Bum.

05:47.243 --> 05:51.512
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

06:03.268 --> 06:04.894
Have you said anything to him?

06:07.230 --> 06:08.897
Well, maybe you should.

06:08.898 --> 06:11.692
He could really use a friend right now.

06:11.693 --> 06:13.318
Kind of burned that bridge.

06:13.319 --> 06:14.988
So fix it.

06:17.949 --> 06:22.119
Cricket... always knew
when I was feeling down.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.664
She'd bring me peanut butter cups.

06:25.665 --> 06:28.166
I know it sounds dumb, but...

06:28.167 --> 06:31.086
I would give anything to share
one with her right now.

06:31.087 --> 06:33.338
You know, it doesn't make sense.

06:33.339 --> 06:36.717
Cricket loved to overnight.
She loved these woods.

06:36.718 --> 06:39.261
She knew where to walk,
where not to walk.

06:39.262 --> 06:43.724
She stopped me from stepping
in the trap that afternoon.

06:43.725 --> 06:45.684
She was coming to meet me.

06:45.685 --> 06:48.937
Holyoke told me that if I didn't
do what he told me to do,

06:48.938 --> 06:51.064
that someone else was going to die.

06:51.065 --> 06:52.733
So, what, you're saying
that you pissed off

06:52.734 --> 06:54.192
a ghost and he killed her?

06:54.193 --> 06:58.363
I knew I should have just
kept my mouth shut.

06:58.364 --> 07:01.034
What happened to Cricket
was an accident.

07:02.535 --> 07:05.997
I just wish there was some way
we could find out for sure.

07:14.255 --> 07:16.256
You're sure it's down here?

07:16.257 --> 07:17.591
Yeah.

07:17.592 --> 07:19.593
Why so surprised?

07:19.594 --> 07:22.262
The camp hasn't been open in six years.

07:22.263 --> 07:23.889
They had to put it somewhere.

07:23.890 --> 07:26.768
Oh, there it is... in the box.

07:34.732 --> 07:36.274
Uh...

07:40.905 --> 07:42.572
You sure about this?

07:42.573 --> 07:44.533
Maybe it's a sign that
we shouldn't be here.

07:44.534 --> 07:47.620
Or... maybe it's a sign that se should.

07:56.545 --> 07:59.465
We're going to talk to Cricket.

08:02.590 --> 08:04.591
This is a horrible idea.

08:04.592 --> 08:06.093
Cricket is dead and you're turning this

08:06.094 --> 08:07.761
into some stupid slumber party game.

08:07.762 --> 08:09.763
It's not a game, it's real.

08:09.764 --> 08:12.641
Look, my... my abuelita was a Santera.

08:12.642 --> 08:14.476
You guys can do what you want.

08:14.477 --> 08:16.478
I'm not doing that... that's voodoo.

08:16.479 --> 08:18.605
Santeria is a religion.

08:18.606 --> 08:19.940
Right.

08:19.941 --> 08:21.650
She knew how to talk to the other side,

08:21.651 --> 08:22.515
and she taught me.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.110
What do you think you're gonna hear?

08:24.111 --> 08:25.653
The truth.

08:25.654 --> 08:29.324
If someone did this to her,
I want some revenge.

08:29.325 --> 08:30.825
No, we can't do this.

08:30.826 --> 08:33.328
If this is real and some
spirit killed her,

08:33.328 --> 08:34.621
it could kill all of us.

08:34.668 --> 08:36.163
Do you guys hear yourselves?

08:36.164 --> 08:38.707
Look... nothing is going to hurt us.

08:38.708 --> 08:41.460
We're going to talk to
Cricket, and that's it.

08:41.461 --> 08:43.482
So after lights out
when the campers go to sleep,

08:43.558 --> 08:45.590
we meet here and we find
out what happened.

08:45.746 --> 08:47.424
You really believe this?

08:47.425 --> 08:50.301
I have to believe this.

08:50.302 --> 08:53.305
I didn't get to say goodbye, Jessie.

08:55.808 --> 08:57.809
Okay.

08:57.810 --> 08:59.478
After lights out.

08:59.942 --> 09:03.064
So...

09:03.065 --> 09:04.523
You finally left Fred.

09:04.524 --> 09:06.942
This can't be happening.

09:06.943 --> 09:10.530
Oh, come on, Dharma Bum.

09:14.742 --> 09:17.243
You can't tell me...

09:17.244 --> 09:20.455
that I haven't been on your mind.

09:20.456 --> 09:22.707
Of course you've been on my mind.

09:22.708 --> 09:25.211
You're the whole reason that I'm here.

09:27.630 --> 09:30.673
I thought...

09:30.674 --> 09:34.219
if I could come back, maybe I could...

09:34.220 --> 09:37.056
recreate the magic, but...

09:37.972 --> 09:40.808
we were...

09:40.809 --> 09:43.727
the Dharma Bums...

09:43.728 --> 09:46.563
one summer a long time ago,

09:46.564 --> 09:49.191
and you have no idea

09:49.192 --> 09:50.654
how badly I screwed up.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.405
Well, let's make it better.

09:55.406 --> 09:57.365
Hmm?

09:57.366 --> 09:58.867
Mm‐hmm.

10:00.076 --> 10:03.036
Let's go into the woods.

10:03.037 --> 10:05.163
Find our old spot.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.502
We have some unfinished
business, you and I.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.050
I can't.

10:17.051 --> 10:21.721
The last time you
asked me to come with you,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.599
you broke my heart.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.561
Why do you have to come back now...

10:28.562 --> 10:29.979
when it's too late?

10:30.313 --> 10:32.314
No.

10:32.315 --> 10:35.400
No, it's never too late
to become the person

10:35.401 --> 10:37.110
you were always meant to be.

10:37.111 --> 10:39.780
You remember that?

10:39.781 --> 10:41.574
Right?

10:42.950 --> 10:47.411
The person I am now has a...

10:47.412 --> 10:48.730
a lot of responsibilities.

10:48.836 --> 10:51.540
A lot has happened in the last 24 hours,

10:51.541 --> 10:53.750
and I need you to leave.

10:53.751 --> 10:55.419
All right.

10:59.381 --> 11:03.551
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

11:03.552 --> 11:05.803
And don't wait too long.

11:05.804 --> 11:09.842
I'm only here tonight,
then I have to go.

11:18.607 --> 11:21.234
Thank you.

11:21.235 --> 11:23.111
Thank you.

11:23.446 --> 11:26.114
Who's the fox?

11:26.115 --> 11:29.201
Oh. Just an old friend.

11:29.202 --> 11:31.995
My ass! Guys who look like
that aren't friends.

11:31.996 --> 11:33.622
Who is he?

11:33.623 --> 11:35.457
Well...

11:35.458 --> 11:37.125
Okay, if you must know,

11:37.126 --> 11:40.837
we had a pretty intense
summer together right before college.

11:40.838 --> 11:44.633
But now he's traveling
the world and writing poetry.

11:44.634 --> 11:47.344
Soul mate?

11:47.345 --> 11:48.678
I haven't seen him in years.

11:48.679 --> 11:50.347
Avoiding the question, counselor.

11:50.481 --> 11:52.515
Damn right.

11:52.516 --> 11:54.183
Excuse me.

11:54.184 --> 11:56.060
Sir, I would like to get your signature

11:56.061 --> 11:57.811
for the Children's Defense League.

11:57.812 --> 11:59.855
We are petitioning
Congress for the Safe Families Act.

11:59.856 --> 12:01.232
Yeah, I know what you're doing here.

12:01.233 --> 12:02.983
I've seen you out here
for the past three days.

12:04.778 --> 12:06.946
We've even had a few clients
complain about it.

12:06.947 --> 12:09.448
Oh. Well, we're a hundred feet
from the building's entrance,

12:09.449 --> 12:10.640
and we're not breaking any laws.

12:10.641 --> 12:12.909
And the sooner we get signatures
on all of these pages,

12:12.910 --> 12:14.244
the sooner we'll be gone.

12:14.245 --> 12:15.912
You know, standing out
on the street corner,

12:15.913 --> 12:17.080
bugging people for signatures

12:17.081 --> 12:18.331
isn't gonna change things, right?

12:18.332 --> 12:20.458
- Hmm.
- See that building right there?

12:20.459 --> 12:24.045
Mason, Morrow & Finch... wall
to wall Harvard lawyers.

12:24.046 --> 12:26.047
That's how you change things.

12:26.048 --> 12:28.573
The act of one person on behalf
of another can change the world.

12:28.575 --> 12:30.259
That's heavy, man.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.718
You get that off a bumper sticker?

12:31.719 --> 12:33.720
"Streetlight 49," Keith Jones.

12:33.721 --> 12:37.558
And as a matter of fact,
I am a Harvard lawyer.

12:37.559 --> 12:38.769
- Really?
- Really.

12:38.899 --> 12:40.727
What did you think of Professor Hartman?

12:40.728 --> 12:44.356
Barfman? Brilliant mind,
terrible breath.

12:45.733 --> 12:47.770
I'll make you a deal.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.694
I'll sign your petition

12:49.695 --> 12:51.204
if you'll give me your phone number.

12:51.319 --> 12:53.155
Hmm. That is not a very original line.

12:53.156 --> 12:54.823
I get that every day.

12:54.824 --> 12:56.241
Did it work this time?

12:56.242 --> 12:59.370
We'll see.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.752
Oh.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.253
We'll see.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.756
Yeah.

13:12.716 --> 13:14.926
‐ You find anything, kiddo? ‐

13:14.927 --> 13:16.886
Are you sure this is all Dad's things?

13:16.887 --> 13:18.846
I mean, he didn't have any other files?

13:18.847 --> 13:20.265
That's it, baby.

13:23.727 --> 13:28.230
You have any idea why Dad was
looking into this stuff?

13:28.231 --> 13:30.232
Oh, honey.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.861
Solving a case, even one
that your dad was working on,

13:33.862 --> 13:35.404
is not gonna bring him back, you know.

13:35.405 --> 13:36.256
I know that, Mom.

13:36.405 --> 13:38.994
Garrett, the hard truth is
the quicker people leave us,

13:39.093 --> 13:40.553
the longer it takes to say goodbye.

13:40.583 --> 13:41.660
How can I say goodbye...

13:43.746 --> 13:46.122
when he keeps showing up?

13:46.123 --> 13:48.124
Ohh. Is this...

13:48.125 --> 13:50.293
I found this in an old cabin.

13:50.294 --> 13:53.171
Dad was there, looking
through the exact same evidence as me.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.182
- No, that makes no sense.
- Mom, I'm telling you.

13:55.184 --> 13:56.298
Garrett, your dad
was a number of things,

13:56.299 --> 13:57.924
but sloppy is not one of them.

13:57.925 --> 13:59.760
There's no say he would leave
something like that behind.

13:59.761 --> 14:02.095
Not without good reason.

14:02.096 --> 14:03.639
What are you talking about?

14:07.268 --> 14:08.353
What is that?

14:12.397 --> 14:13.940
It's a file number.

14:15.442 --> 14:17.193
Dad knew somebody else
would come looking,

14:17.194 --> 14:19.403
and he left this behind to point
them exactly where to go.

14:19.404 --> 14:22.323
- Well, what do you think is there?
- I don't know.

14:22.324 --> 14:25.702
But I'm guessing whatever it
is is what got him killed.

14:50.860 --> 14:53.350
"I've been watching the stars.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.186
That dog is still chasing the hare,

14:56.187 --> 14:59.189
and I'm still trying to finish my novel.

14:59.190 --> 15:02.401
Come stay with me here in Paris."

15:03.569 --> 15:05.404
"Please say yes.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.408
Or are you too busy saving the world?"

15:23.088 --> 15:24.922
Wow.

15:27.299 --> 15:29.050
Is it my imagination,

15:29.051 --> 15:31.260
or did becoming a partner
somehow make you even hotter?

15:31.261 --> 15:34.556
Well, it's gotta be your imagination.

15:38.268 --> 15:40.103
No.

15:40.104 --> 15:41.312
It's not my imagination.

15:41.313 --> 15:44.107
What's in the bag?

15:44.108 --> 15:46.275
Oh, it's a promotion, huh?

15:46.276 --> 15:47.444
Let's celebrate.

15:49.279 --> 15:51.782
Let's see.

15:54.951 --> 15:56.188
Oh.

15:56.325 --> 15:57.744
Deborah Carpenter, will you marry me?

15:59.246 --> 16:01.374
Please say yes.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.294
Of course.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.576
"To the person reading this,

16:41.577 --> 16:43.578
if you followed the trail this far,

16:43.579 --> 16:45.497
it means you've come to understand

16:45.498 --> 16:47.834
the same things about
that place as I did."

16:56.843 --> 16:58.136
Ginger?

16:59.053 --> 17:01.346
What else are you looking for?

17:01.347 --> 17:03.724
Chicken blood.

17:03.725 --> 17:05.517
Is this a seance or a bake‐off?

17:05.518 --> 17:07.310
Don't mock it, Alex.

17:07.310 --> 17:11.147
I mean, this is the way to make
a doorway between worlds.

17:11.148 --> 17:15.234
Blair, this is really
starting to creep me out.

17:16.819 --> 17:19.321
What are you two doing in here.

17:19.323 --> 17:21.156
Uh, we're just grabbing a snack.

17:21.157 --> 17:22.992
The old spirit board?

17:22.992 --> 17:24.993
What we're doing here is
none of your business.

17:24.994 --> 17:27.471
Actually, it is my business, Blair.

17:27.715 --> 17:29.247
- I'm camp director. And...
- And what?

17:29.248 --> 17:31.666
I mean, all you've done
is shut down camp for a day.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.252
No activities, just letting
people sit around and be sad.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.338
At least I'm doing something.

17:36.339 --> 17:37.881
I am your boss. You
have to listen to me.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.716
No. What, do you want to fire me?

17:39.717 --> 17:42.053
- Go ahead.
- Blair.

17:43.262 --> 17:44.554
Go back to your cabin...

17:44.555 --> 17:46.400
and I'll speak with you in the morning.

17:46.543 --> 17:47.681
- Yeah. Maybe we should...
- No, screw that!

17:47.682 --> 17:49.391
I'm tired of taking orders from someone

17:49.392 --> 17:51.895
who obviously doesn't know
what the hell she's doing.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.078
Taxi!

18:14.540 --> 18:16.375
Sorry.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.339
‐ Thanks a lot. Oof! ‐ I'm sorry.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.008
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I...

18:25.802 --> 18:28.136
- Oh, my God!
- Ha!

18:28.137 --> 18:31.224
Well, I always told you
to stay sharp, kid.

18:32.307 --> 18:33.974
How's your writing going?

18:33.975 --> 18:35.643
Oh.

18:35.644 --> 18:37.686
You know, a lot of the old magazines,

18:37.687 --> 18:39.605
they're shutting down. So it's...

18:45.153 --> 18:48.447
If you really want
to know the truth, um...

18:49.317 --> 18:51.241
That poem that I sent you...

18:51.242 --> 18:53.660
was the last time that I got published.

18:53.661 --> 18:57.117
Well, that's crazy.
Your work is beautiful.

18:57.372 --> 19:00.040
You know, you should collect
all the postcards

19:00.041 --> 19:03.335
that you wrote me
and... and put them in a book.

19:03.336 --> 19:05.379
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:05.380 --> 19:08.841
Well, I didn't make copies, so...

19:08.842 --> 19:11.469
Well, I saved them.

19:16.140 --> 19:17.807
Hmm.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.893
- How's Fred?
- Fred.

19:19.894 --> 19:22.645
Fred is... we work a lot,

19:22.646 --> 19:24.397
and we're living the yuppie dream.

19:24.398 --> 19:25.982
What happened to us?

19:25.983 --> 19:28.735
We were the Dharma Bums, and we...

19:28.736 --> 19:31.112
we were gonna save the world.

19:31.113 --> 19:34.490
Yeah, well, I guess
the world changed us.

19:34.491 --> 19:35.710
Didn't it?

19:35.838 --> 19:37.659
Was that summer at camp
the best it's gonna be?

19:37.660 --> 19:39.620
Well...

19:41.122 --> 19:45.334
If we ever want to
go back to that summer,

19:45.335 --> 19:49.296
we know exactly where
to find it, don't we?

19:49.297 --> 19:52.549
- Oh!
- Huh?

19:52.550 --> 19:55.177
- The time capsule.
- Yes.

19:56.387 --> 19:57.637
You got three hours?

19:58.371 --> 20:00.640
We could drive up there
right now and dig it up.

20:00.641 --> 20:01.522
- I'm serious.
- No, I know.

20:01.546 --> 20:02.516
But I know what we are now.

20:02.517 --> 20:04.393
We're the creepy adults
who, like, show up,

20:04.394 --> 20:06.144
and the kids are like,
"Why are they here?"

20:06.145 --> 20:07.729
No. There aren't any kids there.

20:07.730 --> 20:09.856
- What?
- The camp's been closed for years.

20:09.857 --> 20:11.233
You didn't know that? It's true.

20:11.234 --> 20:13.193
Come on.

20:13.194 --> 20:15.237
Are you in?

20:15.238 --> 20:17.573
Let's do this. Come on.

20:17.574 --> 20:19.616
Come on, come on, come on.

20:19.617 --> 20:23.079
No, I can't. I need to get home.

20:39.886 --> 20:41.721
Deb, I really need this.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.141
Look...

20:46.142 --> 20:48.226
I'm only here tonight. I...

20:48.227 --> 20:50.045
I leave in the morning. So...

20:52.398 --> 20:54.692
If you change your mind...

20:57.152 --> 20:59.779
you know where to find me, right?

21:22.593 --> 21:24.177
I knew you'd come.

21:33.103 --> 21:35.229
Would you care to dance?

21:35.230 --> 21:36.814
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:36.815 --> 21:38.483
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:49.746 --> 21:50.994
I don't deserve to feel this happy.

21:50.995 --> 21:53.122
Happiness isn't something
that you deserve.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.292
Do you remember a kid named Polly?

21:58.293 --> 21:59.627
Right?

21:59.628 --> 22:01.587
Yeah.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.423
The one that got flu, like,
on the first day of camp,

22:03.424 --> 22:05.133
and she was so upset

22:05.134 --> 22:07.586
that all the other kids
were swimming and running around.

22:07.723 --> 22:09.511
She was stuck in bed.

22:09.512 --> 22:12.139
And you...

22:12.140 --> 22:14.474
you stayed with her.

22:14.475 --> 22:19.021
You were playing cards
and painting her fingernails,

22:19.022 --> 22:20.564
if I remember.

22:20.565 --> 22:22.357
We talked about her parents' divorce.

22:22.358 --> 22:24.026
Yeah.

22:24.027 --> 22:27.029
She ended up having a great
time because of you.

22:27.030 --> 22:30.991
I ended up getting the flu.

22:30.992 --> 22:34.911
Oh, God. You were always
the heart of the camp.

22:34.912 --> 22:36.406
- Yeah.
- You still are, you know?

22:36.455 --> 22:39.623
Those were days were...

22:39.624 --> 22:41.834
the best.

22:41.835 --> 22:43.002
Yeah.

22:43.003 --> 22:44.421
Yeah.

22:45.922 --> 22:48.300
Those days are gone.

22:50.594 --> 22:52.804
Forever.

22:58.059 --> 23:00.895
Maybe they're just beginning.

23:08.194 --> 23:11.071
Okay.

23:11.072 --> 23:14.367
These three candles represent light.

23:16.244 --> 23:17.911
And...

23:17.912 --> 23:21.415
according to my abuelita,

23:21.416 --> 23:24.043
the white roses draw in the spirits.

23:26.045 --> 23:28.881
What is this for?

23:28.882 --> 23:31.217
Sometimes spirits can communicate
using writing.

23:34.221 --> 23:37.056
Dear spirits of kindness and light,

23:37.057 --> 23:39.851
we invite you to join us here tonight

23:39.852 --> 23:42.103
to speak your thoughts and wishes

23:42.104 --> 23:44.022
as openly as you desire.

23:44.023 --> 23:48.027
We banish forces of darkness and evil.

23:53.074 --> 23:54.575
Blair...

23:54.576 --> 23:56.578
don't do this.

23:57.996 --> 23:59.413
Everyone hold hands.

23:59.414 --> 24:00.790
Blair, maybe we should...

24:00.791 --> 24:02.751
Quiet. Concentrate.

24:03.377 --> 24:06.046
Are you sure we should be doing this?

24:06.047 --> 24:07.255
We are doing this.

24:07.256 --> 24:09.966
Carolina Maria Diaz,

24:09.967 --> 24:13.428
we are gathered here in your
name and your memory.

24:13.429 --> 24:18.810
If you wish to communicate with
us, please, give us a sign.

24:21.104 --> 24:24.482
Cricket, please.

24:24.483 --> 24:27.652
It's okay, Blair.

24:27.653 --> 24:29.655
It's okay.

24:33.116 --> 24:33.951
Look.

24:36.246 --> 24:39.581
This is a trick.
This can't be happening!

24:47.468 --> 24:49.008
Amy!

24:49.009 --> 24:50.885
Blair, what the hell is happening?!

24:52.012 --> 24:54.285
I don't know!

25:01.522 --> 25:02.564
I can see you!

25:02.565 --> 25:04.858
Cricket!

25:04.859 --> 25:07.527
Yes! Yes, it's me, it's me!

25:07.528 --> 25:10.321
It's you! It's really you!

25:11.323 --> 25:12.532
Stop!

25:12.533 --> 25:13.533
- Stop!
- No!

25:13.534 --> 25:14.701
Cricket!

25:14.702 --> 25:17.203
Come back, come back!

25:18.664 --> 25:20.623
Somebody pushed me!

25:20.624 --> 25:22.667
Who pushed you? Cricket, what happened?!

25:22.668 --> 25:24.043
Who pushed you?!

25:24.044 --> 25:26.004
Cricket, where are you?

25:26.005 --> 25:28.673
Are you okay?!

25:28.674 --> 25:30.909
Oh, no! He's coming!

25:33.064 --> 25:34.221
He's so close! I have to go!

25:34.222 --> 25:36.015
- Cricket!
- Blair!

25:36.016 --> 25:38.559
- Blair?!
- I'm here!

25:40.307 --> 25:43.064
You should have killed Amy
when you had the chance.

25:43.065 --> 25:46.151
She is the doorway! Kill her!

25:46.152 --> 25:47.569
Kill her!

25:47.570 --> 25:49.739
Kill her now!

25:52.199 --> 25:53.199
Amy!

25:55.286 --> 25:56.703
Shut it down, Blair!

25:56.704 --> 25:58.038
Holy Jesus, help us!

25:58.039 --> 25:58.873
Hurry up!

26:13.972 --> 26:15.389
Amen.

26:25.442 --> 26:28.737
What happened?

26:30.947 --> 26:32.865
Jessie?

26:32.866 --> 26:34.951
Are you okay?

26:37.412 --> 26:39.748
Jessie!

26:42.627 --> 26:44.754
What's happening?

26:46.798 --> 26:47.965
Help!

27:05.820 --> 27:08.530
Show me that it's
all real. It's all real.

27:08.531 --> 27:11.408
I didn't draw that! I
don't know how to draw!

27:11.409 --> 27:13.743
Jess, come on, relax.

27:13.744 --> 27:15.120
Seriously?

27:15.121 --> 27:17.247
Did you not just see
what happened to me?

27:17.248 --> 27:19.075
To Amy? She was possessed!

27:19.230 --> 27:20.626
It was Cricket.

27:20.627 --> 27:22.753
But then it was... it was someone else.

27:22.754 --> 27:25.339
Someone else? What happened to me?

27:25.340 --> 27:26.967
We woke something up.

27:28.176 --> 27:29.385
Something bad.

27:29.386 --> 27:30.970
Holyoke.

27:30.971 --> 27:32.179
What?

27:32.180 --> 27:34.515
Blair, I told you not to...

27:34.516 --> 27:36.016
It was supposed to be Cricket.

27:36.017 --> 27:38.102
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

27:38.103 --> 27:39.478
You said you knew what you were doing.

27:39.479 --> 27:40.980
Leave him alone, Alex.

27:40.981 --> 27:42.136
Oh, I'm sorry, Drew.

27:42.278 --> 27:44.025
Did you miss the part where
Amy tried to stab herself?

27:44.026 --> 27:46.528
Hey!

27:46.529 --> 27:48.280
Everybody calm down.

27:48.281 --> 27:51.199
What happened
tonight was awful and weird.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.827
But now we know some things.

27:53.828 --> 27:55.579
Like what?

27:55.580 --> 27:58.331
Your stupid movies aren't nearly
as screwed up as all this?

27:58.332 --> 28:02.002
Like that all this is real,
and we have to deal with it...

28:02.003 --> 28:04.755
no matter how crazy it seems.

28:04.756 --> 28:06.674
Holyoke still has his sights on Amy.

28:08.218 --> 28:11.637
What did he mean when he
said she was the doorway?

28:11.638 --> 28:14.808
‐ I don't know. ‐
Then I'm getting help.

28:17.269 --> 28:19.353
I'm gonna call Sykes.

28:19.354 --> 28:22.064
Jessie...

28:22.065 --> 28:24.192
I'll cover your cabin.

28:24.193 --> 28:25.235
Thanks.

28:32.035 --> 28:34.077
Okay, wow.

28:34.078 --> 28:38.874
This is... this is not how
I pictured this night going.

28:38.875 --> 28:40.375
That's funny.

28:40.376 --> 28:43.045
'Cause, you know,
this is exactly how I...

28:43.046 --> 28:44.838
pictured this going.

28:48.885 --> 28:51.720
This is, um...

28:51.721 --> 28:53.680
This is what I wanted...

28:53.681 --> 28:55.491
that day I‐I bumped into you.

28:56.519 --> 28:59.687
You and me here... forever,

28:59.688 --> 29:02.441
just... just like this.

29:04.277 --> 29:06.237
You know that I can't stay, right?

29:06.238 --> 29:07.446
No.

29:07.447 --> 29:09.240
Actually, I... I don't.

29:09.241 --> 29:12.993
I don't know that. Not after this.

29:15.580 --> 29:17.488
I'm sorry, Deb.

29:18.584 --> 29:22.045
I wasn't lying when I said
that I had to leave.

29:22.046 --> 29:24.339
Hey.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.007
Keith!

29:28.719 --> 29:30.346
Are you kidding?

29:33.724 --> 29:35.433
Keith?

29:35.434 --> 29:37.602
Hey, come back!

29:37.603 --> 29:39.313
Keith!

29:42.985 --> 29:44.318
Who's there?

29:44.319 --> 29:46.028
What are you doing?

29:46.029 --> 29:47.947
What's going on at camp?

29:47.948 --> 29:49.282
- Are you okay?
- No.

29:49.283 --> 29:51.617
Now tell me everything.

29:51.618 --> 29:55.621
I found a notebook that
belonged to my dad.

29:55.622 --> 29:57.957
He was looking into
the exact same things

29:57.958 --> 30:00.877
that are going on at
camp now... satanic rituals...

30:00.878 --> 30:03.087
just before he got killed.

30:03.088 --> 30:05.919
You mean this is happening he... here?

30:06.060 --> 30:06.758
According to this,

30:06.759 --> 30:08.844
they would have buried a lock of hair,

30:08.845 --> 30:11.805
a deer heart, and a skull for
the ceremony to be complete.

30:11.806 --> 30:13.765
So I went out there and started digging.

30:13.766 --> 30:15.374
Nothing.

30:15.509 --> 30:16.853
Which means they weren't
doing this ritual,

30:16.854 --> 30:19.480
which means my theories are
crap, which means I'm an idiot.

30:19.481 --> 30:21.649
So, why are you out here?

30:21.650 --> 30:24.235
Because you're not an idiot.
Something is happening there.

30:24.236 --> 30:26.322
I didn't believe it, but...

30:29.491 --> 30:31.951
Where'd this come from?

30:31.952 --> 30:34.495
We...

30:34.496 --> 30:35.872
did a seance tonight.

30:35.873 --> 30:38.833
- What?
- Just... just don't.

30:38.834 --> 30:42.670
I passed out, and when I woke
up, I was drawing this.

30:42.671 --> 30:43.963
You sure you weren't drunk or something?

30:43.964 --> 30:45.965
Garrett. Look.

30:45.966 --> 30:47.675
That's not even my handwriting.

30:47.676 --> 30:49.160
Who did this? Who made that map?

30:49.385 --> 30:50.220
What's happening to me?

30:50.221 --> 30:51.513
What... what happened to Cricket?

30:51.514 --> 30:54.225
I don't know. Just...

30:56.394 --> 30:58.521
Can you turn the lights on, please?

31:13.371 --> 31:16.790
I think I know where
they buried the skull.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.167
Keith!

31:19.168 --> 31:21.045
Where are you?!

31:22.630 --> 31:25.049
Where are you?!

31:30.764 --> 31:33.933
You shouldn't have followed me.

31:33.934 --> 31:35.434
I can't lose you.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.561
Not again.

32:03.047 --> 32:04.715
Hey.

32:04.716 --> 32:07.050
Hey, hey, hey, wake up.

32:07.051 --> 32:08.635
What... what did you...

32:24.361 --> 32:26.572
Deb, I need this.

32:58.688 --> 33:01.148
Stay with me, please.

33:01.149 --> 33:02.191
Don't go.

33:02.192 --> 33:03.692
I have to.

33:03.693 --> 33:05.748
Okay.

33:06.864 --> 33:11.284
I'll come with you.

33:11.285 --> 33:12.744
You don't know what you're saying.

33:12.745 --> 33:16.456
I know exactly what I'm saying.

33:16.457 --> 33:19.667
There is nothing here for me now.

33:19.668 --> 33:22.045
It's not your fault.

33:22.046 --> 33:25.090
It's not your fault
what happened to Cricket.

33:25.091 --> 33:26.882
You don't control everything, Deb.

33:29.221 --> 33:30.888
I should have protected her.

33:30.889 --> 33:34.058
What happened to her can't be undone.

33:34.059 --> 33:37.269
But there are other kids here
that are gonna need your help,

33:37.270 --> 33:39.397
and they're gonna need it soon.

33:39.398 --> 33:41.774
You have to stay here for them.

33:43.610 --> 33:45.945
I can't.

33:45.946 --> 33:48.239
Not without you.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.366
Yes, you can.

33:50.367 --> 33:52.701
That's why you left Fred.

33:52.702 --> 33:54.743
That's why you're here,
not because of me.

33:55.540 --> 33:57.207
Because of you.

33:57.208 --> 33:59.042
You came back here

33:59.043 --> 34:02.087
to finally be what you
were always meant to be.

34:02.088 --> 34:05.215
Will I see you again?

34:05.216 --> 34:07.384
Whenever you need me.

34:07.385 --> 34:10.011
You'll know just where to find me.

34:10.012 --> 34:11.730
Stay sharp, kid.

34:12.224 --> 34:14.891
There's more things coming.

34:14.893 --> 34:18.271
Dark things.

34:18.272 --> 34:20.188
Maybe you didn't save the world...

34:20.190 --> 34:23.694
but you might just be able
to save these kids.

34:52.476 --> 34:55.018
I'm sorry, Keith.

34:55.020 --> 34:58.690
I know this is what
you wanted me to do, but...

35:03.487 --> 35:06.323
it wasn't supposed to be like this.

35:08.116 --> 35:11.244
You were supposed to be here, too.

35:13.747 --> 35:15.957
We were supposed to be here together.

35:31.849 --> 35:36.019
What happened to Cricket hurt all of us.

35:36.020 --> 35:40.565
But instead of
being here for you, I hid.

35:40.566 --> 35:43.193
And if some of you are thinking...

35:43.194 --> 35:47.948
or saying that I'm not doing my job...

35:47.949 --> 35:50.114
I understand that.

35:51.160 --> 35:56.722
But at Camp Stillwater,
we look out for each other.

35:57.834 --> 36:01.170
We all have broken hearts.

36:01.171 --> 36:05.841
But maybe trying to talk to
the ghost of a person we miss

36:05.842 --> 36:10.054
the most isn't the
best way to remember them.

36:10.055 --> 36:14.100
If we're looking for Cricket,
we don't need to look out there,

36:14.101 --> 36:16.602
we need to look inside ourselves.

36:16.603 --> 36:22.900
This summer will
always be a special summer,

36:22.901 --> 36:27.921
because it is the one that holds
the last memories of Cricket.

37:10.868 --> 37:13.077
I'm sorry.

37:13.078 --> 37:14.246
I'm sorry, too.

37:56.290 --> 37:57.457
Oh, my God!

38:24.528 --> 38:26.154
Garrett?

38:34.329 --> 38:35.580
Jess, look.

38:39.835 --> 38:42.420
That's where Dave's body
was found, right?

38:42.421 --> 38:45.089
Right where it says "1."

38:45.090 --> 38:46.841
And that's where we found Cricket.

38:46.842 --> 38:48.884
That's 3.

38:48.885 --> 38:52.013
What do you think
we'll find if we look there?

38:54.891 --> 38:57.893
We're about there.

38:57.894 --> 39:00.063
‐ Here?
- Yeah.

39:19.667 --> 39:21.043
What the?

39:23.588 --> 39:25.173
It's blood.

39:27.216 --> 39:28.884
Something was buried here.

39:28.885 --> 39:30.343
Or someone.

39:30.344 --> 39:32.012
But whoever did it...

39:32.013 --> 39:33.597
They came back and moved it.

39:33.598 --> 39:36.100
Which means they know we're onto them.

39:39.271 --> 39:42.356
‐ Did they find it? ‐ No.

39:42.357 --> 39:44.442
Someone moved it.

39:44.443 --> 39:45.666
Who?

39:45.815 --> 39:47.570
The same person that's been
helping us all along.

39:47.571 --> 39:50.031
Yeah, well, we still don't
know who they are.

39:50.032 --> 39:51.574
No, but whoever it is,

39:51.575 --> 39:53.242
the teacher says we should thank them...

39:53.243 --> 39:57.247
for showing us what a true
believer really is.

40:09.927 --> 40:12.304
It's number 4.

40:17.184 --> 40:18.935
They're going to kill again.
