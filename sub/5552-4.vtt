WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.421
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.588 --> 00:06.925
My forefathers were betrayed,
their legacy erased.

00:07.092 --> 00:09.594
And I am here to punish those
who wronged us.

00:09.761 --> 00:11.262
- We have a deal?
- We do.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.196
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll train every day.

00:28.363 --> 00:29.739
Yeah, but you said that before,
didn't you?

00:29.906 --> 00:31.199
I'll even go back to school.

00:34.285 --> 00:35.662
I saved your life.

00:35.829 --> 00:37.747
You wanted to do it, too.
You just didn't have the guts.

00:37.914 --> 00:39.666
Selina, I miss you.

00:43.712 --> 00:45.630
This is not what we rehearsed.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.632
I'm so sorry, Jerome.

00:47.799 --> 00:50.593
Enter the hero.

01:05.942 --> 01:08.862
<i>Gentlemen,
ladies, others,</i>

01:09.154 --> 01:12.991
let us discuss the future
with a little civility, shall we?

01:21.875 --> 01:25.503
So, not one of you knows who orchestrated

01:25.670 --> 01:27.714
and/or executed the Arkham breakout?

01:28.715 --> 01:30.675
I find that hard to believe.

01:31.176 --> 01:34.846
I mean, the cop's only lead
is an old blind man, for God's sake.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.223
A blind man!

01:37.474 --> 01:40.018
Then, who here is to be trusted?

01:41.478 --> 01:43.271
Because someone knows.

01:44.856 --> 01:46.232
Uh... We thought it was you.

01:47.317 --> 01:50.361
Why would I do that?
We've never had it better.

01:50.653 --> 01:54.199
I gave you all the freedom in the world

01:54.574 --> 01:57.702
and business boomed for all of us.

01:58.870 --> 02:00.205
<i>A new generation.</i>

02:00.371 --> 02:04.000
Then that ginger maniac
had to spoil everything.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.585
<i>Even now he's dead,</i>

02:05.752 --> 02:08.171
public is still terrified,
business is in the can,

02:08.338 --> 02:09.756
and what are we doing?

02:09.923 --> 02:11.549
Fighting among ourselves.

02:12.383 --> 02:14.219
Is this how any of us wants to live?

02:14.552 --> 02:18.139
Squabbling, brawling, running, hiding?

02:18.389 --> 02:20.183
This city belongs to us now.

02:20.350 --> 02:23.353
But kids, that brings responsibilities.

02:23.853 --> 02:28.066
We need to restore
confidence in our brand, if you will.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.735
We need discipline and unity, yes?

02:33.112 --> 02:35.240
There will be no more chaos,

02:35.406 --> 02:36.699
<i>no more gang wars,</i>

02:36.866 --> 02:39.410
<i>no more blood in the streets
scaring decent folk.</i>

02:39.577 --> 02:42.288
From now on, if you want to kill someone,

02:42.455 --> 02:44.916
<i>blackmail, steal, or kidnap anyone,</i>

02:45.083 --> 02:46.709
<i>I need to hear about it first.</i>

02:47.085 --> 02:48.336
Understand?

02:48.545 --> 02:49.754
- We got it.
- Fine.

03:01.266 --> 03:02.600
Bravo.

03:02.809 --> 03:05.311
Quite the King Solomon.
You had them nicely in line.

03:05.478 --> 03:06.521
Who are you?

03:06.688 --> 03:09.357
My brother would very much like
to talk to you.

03:09.816 --> 03:10.859
Alone.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.277
Why are you looking at me like that?

03:12.443 --> 03:13.444
You don't know me.

03:13.611 --> 03:14.612
Relax, Butch.

03:14.988 --> 03:17.532
He has issues. Bipolar.

03:18.116 --> 03:19.784
She don't know me. I'm just saying.

03:20.493 --> 03:22.120
Your brother?

03:22.287 --> 03:23.788
Theodore Galavan.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.207
<i>There's a car waiting for you outside.</i>

03:30.044 --> 03:32.338
I'm sick and tired of your
holier-than-thou crap, Gordon.

03:32.505 --> 03:34.132
Yeah? Then do some police work.

03:34.299 --> 03:36.467
The last arrest you made was your bookie.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.011
- Which is why--
- Back off!

03:40.471 --> 03:43.391
My name is Nathaniel Barnes.

03:43.766 --> 03:46.144
Captain Nathaniel Barnes.

03:46.811 --> 03:49.439
That's right, I'm your new boss.

03:50.648 --> 03:51.733
Ten hut!

03:55.486 --> 03:57.238
You, clean that up.

04:01.784 --> 04:03.411
You know when this place was built?

04:04.954 --> 04:06.706
Over 100 years ago.

04:08.291 --> 04:12.003
Can you imagine how many perps have been
booked in here since that time?

04:13.004 --> 04:17.467
All the murderers, rapists, thieves
that have been locked up?

04:18.676 --> 04:22.555
They don't make them like this anymore.
Strong, sturdy.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.684
And yet,

04:27.936 --> 04:29.354
just days ago,

04:30.813 --> 04:34.442
an escaped convict just strolls in here,
into our house.

04:34.609 --> 04:35.944
Our house.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.905
And murders your commissioner,

04:39.489 --> 04:41.866
<i>and nine of your fellow comrades.</i>

04:42.700 --> 04:44.869
I wasn't even here, and I'm ashamed.

04:46.371 --> 04:47.747
Are you all ashamed?

04:48.373 --> 04:49.707
<i>I hope so.</i>

04:49.958 --> 04:53.628
Anyone that's here
that's not ashamed and angry

04:54.253 --> 04:55.421
should resign.

04:55.797 --> 04:56.798
Right now!

05:02.804 --> 05:03.805
Huh.

05:06.224 --> 05:08.685
Some of you are lying to yourselves.

05:08.935 --> 05:10.395
I've got your files here.

05:10.728 --> 05:15.108
I've read them all.
Step forward if you hear your name called.

05:16.067 --> 05:19.487
Pollard. Guthrie. Coulson.

05:20.071 --> 05:24.951
Dowler. Brooks. Perez. Hightower.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.959
You aren't ashamed. You have no shame.

05:33.668 --> 05:37.380
You're not police,
you're lowlife criminals.

05:38.756 --> 05:43.094
Bribery, drug abuse,
extortion, racketeering.

05:43.261 --> 05:45.638
Sons of bitches! You're all fired.

05:48.766 --> 05:49.892
Drop off your badges

05:50.059 --> 05:52.979
and your guns with the desk sergeant
on your way out.

05:53.730 --> 05:56.566
Hey. You can't do this. We got rights.

05:57.942 --> 06:01.279
Yes, you're right.
You do have rights.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.114
You have the right to remain silent,

06:03.281 --> 06:04.741
<i>you have the right to an attorney.</i>

06:05.700 --> 06:06.951
Take him.

06:07.827 --> 06:09.078
From now on,

06:09.996 --> 06:14.000
any officer, detective, rookie or clerk
who breaks the law

06:14.167 --> 06:17.295
will not just lose their job,
they will go to jail.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.466
If you turned a blind eye to crime,
I will bust you.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.468
If you fail to help a fellow officer

06:23.634 --> 06:27.305
because of cowardice or apathy,
I will bust you.

06:31.142 --> 06:32.685
What the hell are you still doing here?

06:34.270 --> 06:35.480
Don't make me mad.

06:39.317 --> 06:42.361
Anyone who didn't hear their name called,
get back to work.

06:43.988 --> 06:45.740
I'd like to see you in my office, please.

06:54.707 --> 06:57.335
Well? What do you think about
what I said out there?

07:02.298 --> 07:03.508
I agree with every word, sir.

07:05.343 --> 07:06.511
Every word, huh?

07:07.845 --> 07:09.388
You a sycophant, Gordon?

07:10.681 --> 07:11.849
No, sir.

07:12.058 --> 07:13.351
"No, sir."

07:14.644 --> 07:16.229
I've read all your files.

07:17.021 --> 07:18.815
Army, Academy, G.C.P.D.

07:20.817 --> 07:22.276
You're a troublemaker.

07:23.194 --> 07:24.362
A fighter.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.491
Is that an accurate assessment?

07:29.742 --> 07:30.952
Yes, sir.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.872
Good. You're my second-in-command.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.375
Starting now, Jim,

07:37.542 --> 07:39.085
we're gonna fix this department

07:39.252 --> 07:41.879
and bring respect for law and order
back to this city.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.214
Yes, sir.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.428
We're, uh, kind of shorthanded.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.181
What, do you think I cut too deep?

07:52.723 --> 07:55.434
You could have thrown out 20 more guys
and not hit bottom.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.562
<i>Fixing this department is gonna be tough.</i>

07:58.437 --> 08:01.274
Maybe tougher than you think, sir.

08:02.900 --> 08:06.028
Welcome to my unit, you sad-ass Army hump.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.573
Tough is what we eat for breakfast.

08:09.699 --> 08:11.242
Jarhead, huh?

08:12.285 --> 08:13.494
Who would have guessed.

08:17.248 --> 08:18.457
Sir.

08:22.253 --> 08:24.755
I hope you just told him
he made a huge mistake.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.048
I don't think he did.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.092
Come on, Jim.
We've seen his type come and go.

08:28.259 --> 08:30.761
Idealists, always looking
to walk the straight line.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.388
Gotham doesn't have straight lines.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.348
It's got twists and turns and dead ends.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.934
Yeah. But it doesn't have to be that way.

08:41.772 --> 08:45.443
<i>With Mayor James still missing
and the deputy mayor recently murdered,</i>

08:45.610 --> 08:49.947
<i>the need for leadership at City Hall is of
paramount concern to Gotham's citizens.</i>

08:50.114 --> 08:53.701
<i>Today, two more hopeful candidates
have thrown their hats into the ring.</i>

08:54.118 --> 08:56.120
<i>Janice Caulfield is a city councilor</i>

08:56.412 --> 08:59.665
<i>who began her political career
as an environmental activist.</i>

08:59.832 --> 09:03.878
<i>Randall Hobbs, the longest-serving
teamster boss in Gotham's history,</i>

09:04.045 --> 09:06.297
<i>is another candidate with a strong base.</i>

09:06.464 --> 09:07.715
<i>In the latest polls, though,</i>

09:07.882 --> 09:11.552
<i>a surprise surge for a man
who has not even declared his candidacy,</i>

09:11.719 --> 09:12.845
<i>Theo Galavan.</i>

09:13.012 --> 09:17.141
<i>The dashing billionaire businessman has
not ruled out a bid for the mayor's job.</i>

09:17.308 --> 09:20.394
<i>But he is considering his options,
according to a spokesman.</i>

09:21.729 --> 09:24.649
Mr. Cobblepot, finally, we meet.

09:25.274 --> 09:26.525
Call me Penguin.

09:27.068 --> 09:28.653
I thought I heard you hated that name.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.571
It grew on me.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.199
Penguin it is. Please, sit.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.494
- How's your head?
- Oh, healing, thank you.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.329
Gave me quite a scare.

09:38.496 --> 09:40.373
You were lucky to get out of there
with your life.

09:41.457 --> 09:42.792
Wasn't I just?

09:45.169 --> 09:46.212
Was it luck?

09:46.379 --> 09:48.464
You are a clever man.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.677
Perfect timing, dear.
Do you two know each other?

09:53.552 --> 09:54.845
We've met.

09:58.891 --> 10:00.101
Oh, my.

10:01.686 --> 10:03.145
The Arkham breakout,

10:04.522 --> 10:07.358
the G.C.P.D. massacre,
Jerome and the Maniax.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.236
All you.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.905
<i>- Of course.</i>
- Guilty.

10:14.031 --> 10:17.034
It was foolish of me to think
I could trick the King of Gotham.

10:17.368 --> 10:18.536
Here.

10:18.995 --> 10:20.371
You need this more than me.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.373
I'll make another.

10:23.708 --> 10:28.713
My sister tells me you're doing a
stellar job of organizing your new empire.

10:29.839 --> 10:31.048
I try.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.342
You're not the King of Gotham,

10:33.634 --> 10:35.177
you're the King of Garbage.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.055
A year ago, I held Fish Mooney's umbrella.

10:38.389 --> 10:40.099
<i>Now she's dead by my hand.</i>

10:40.891 --> 10:42.184
Along with Maroni.

10:43.019 --> 10:46.188
Falcone is in hiding
and all of their businesses are mine.

10:47.064 --> 10:51.193
They all underestimated me.
I suggest you not make the same mistake.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.238
My sister is too blunt.

10:54.447 --> 10:56.032
But she is honest.

10:57.575 --> 11:00.745
The foundations of this great city
were laid 200 years ago

11:00.911 --> 11:03.873
by some very dedicated people.

11:05.166 --> 11:09.253
Now, it's an old, crumbling pigsty,
full of human waste.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.881
<i>It's time to move into the future.</i>

11:12.506 --> 11:15.259
A cleaner, brighter

11:17.553 --> 11:18.679
future.

11:27.563 --> 11:28.564
Uh...

11:29.732 --> 11:31.650
Those are all residential areas.

11:31.942 --> 11:35.863
So, thousands of homes would
have to be destroyed, wouldn't they?

11:36.364 --> 11:37.573
Yeah, so?

11:40.534 --> 11:41.577
<i>Here's the rub.</i>

11:41.744 --> 11:43.871
In order to rebuild,
I need first to destroy.

11:44.038 --> 11:45.289
But I can't do that.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.166
I mean, watch the news, I'm a hero.

11:47.333 --> 11:51.253
But you have a certain flair
for such a task.

11:51.796 --> 11:53.464
You, Penguin.

11:55.216 --> 11:57.301
You will be my destroyer.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.889
Truly, I'm flattered.

12:02.306 --> 12:04.141
<i>Thank you so much for thinking of me.</i>

12:05.017 --> 12:08.437
<i>But, my dear sir, you have me all wrong.</i>

12:08.604 --> 12:13.317
I have no flair for destruction.
I'm a builder, a problem solver.

12:14.402 --> 12:18.239
Besides, such a huge project would need
the support of hundreds of city officials.

12:18.406 --> 12:21.409
Yes. Only the highest authority
could see it through correctly.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.787
Say, a mayor with a landslide mandate.

12:26.455 --> 12:27.665
But you're not a candidate.

12:27.832 --> 12:29.041
Oh, I will be.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.752
By popular demand.

12:32.169 --> 12:35.464
Alas, some of my fellow candidates
actually stand a chance of winning,

12:35.631 --> 12:38.676
so, they'll have to go.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.679
"Go"?

12:41.846 --> 12:44.223
And I'm gonna need you
to take a crack at me, also.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.100
And miss, of course.

12:46.559 --> 12:48.394
<i>Don't want anyone to think
that I had anything</i>

12:48.686 --> 12:50.896
to do with my fellow candidates' demise.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.865
That's smart thinking.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.576
However, with all due respect,
Mr. Galavan,

13:04.160 --> 13:05.327
I'm not your man.

13:06.454 --> 13:07.997
You need an assassin.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.708
This is Gotham,
you can find them in the phone book.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.084
Under "A."

13:15.171 --> 13:18.007
One moment, Mr. Penguin.

13:19.884 --> 13:22.386
I'm sorry. I took you for a man of vision.

13:23.721 --> 13:25.848
Taba, do you wanna get the remote, dear?

13:26.849 --> 13:27.850
Yay.

13:29.477 --> 13:30.895
Before you leave,

13:31.228 --> 13:34.857
my sister would love to show you
her favorite reality show.

13:35.024 --> 13:36.901
She's addicted!

13:42.823 --> 13:44.492
She's being kind of dull right now,

13:44.658 --> 13:48.120
but sometimes,
she cries and bangs on the door.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.080
<i>- Free me.</i>
<i>- Mother!</i>

13:50.539 --> 13:53.209
<i>I swear.
I swear, I don't know about--</i>

13:53.375 --> 13:55.586
You'll pay for this!

13:55.753 --> 13:58.088
That's the spirit.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.301
They die, your mother lives.

14:03.469 --> 14:04.595
Simple.

14:07.223 --> 14:08.682
<i>Please!</i>

14:12.061 --> 14:15.606
<i>I swear. I don't know nothing.</i>

14:34.625 --> 14:36.710
- Thompkins.
<i>- Good morning, Dr. Thompkins.</i>

14:37.169 --> 14:39.171
Captain Barnes, G.C.P.D.

14:40.381 --> 14:43.717
- Captain Barnes, hi.
<i>- I hear great things about you, Doc.</i>

14:43.884 --> 14:45.469
Get ready to get real busy.

14:45.636 --> 14:48.681
We're gonna be sending you
a whole lot of dead bad guys.

14:49.098 --> 14:51.642
Oh, uh, okay, okay.

14:52.226 --> 14:53.435
May I speak to Jim?

14:56.146 --> 14:57.648
He wants to talk to you.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.570
This is Gordon.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.030
Meet me at the Police Academy at 0700.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.699
The Academy, yes, sir.

15:08.284 --> 15:09.868
If you don't mind me asking, sir--

15:10.035 --> 15:11.954
Everybody knows you're banging the ME.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.248
<i>I'll see you in an hour.</i>

15:34.184 --> 15:35.686
<i>Oldest in your class.</i>

15:38.063 --> 15:41.358
Not the strongest, or the fastest,

15:42.192 --> 15:44.612
or even the most
academically-gifted, either.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.946
And yet,

15:46.697 --> 15:48.365
you finished at the top of your class.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.034
Now how did you do that?

15:50.826 --> 15:52.036
I'll tell you how.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.414
You were a soldier.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.207
You saw combat

15:57.458 --> 16:00.002
while your classmates
were still playing with themselves

16:00.210 --> 16:01.920
in their parents' basements.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.505
You got blood on your face.

16:05.549 --> 16:06.717
You could say that.

16:07.343 --> 16:10.012
You're a warrior, Jim. So am I.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.390
But you can't carry on
the way you've been.

16:14.308 --> 16:18.687
Going after everyone on your own.
You need help that you can rely on.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.356
With all due respect, sir--

16:20.731 --> 16:24.193
What if there were a team of young cops
who haven't been bought yet?

16:24.485 --> 16:25.903
<i>Not jaded, not corrupted,</i>

16:26.070 --> 16:28.947
still filled with hope and faith
in the system.

16:32.076 --> 16:33.243
Cadets?

16:33.410 --> 16:35.454
This is the greatest academy
in the country.

16:35.788 --> 16:37.581
Graduation is next week.

16:37.748 --> 16:42.086
We could grab a group of their finest
before some precinct kills their spirit.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.839
Wouldn't hurt to look into it, right?

16:54.598 --> 16:56.934
I don't want anybody getting shot
under my supervision, okay?

16:57.101 --> 16:59.395
- Gus!
- Captain Barnes.

16:59.603 --> 17:00.896
This is Gordon.

17:01.397 --> 17:04.608
Sure, I remember this guy.
He argued a lot.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.152
I like to think I was raising questions.

17:07.361 --> 17:09.279
- What do you got for us?
- This way.

17:14.618 --> 17:15.953
Keep your eye on the little one.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.374
The one getting her ass handed to her?

17:21.208 --> 17:22.292
Wait.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.181
Patience.

17:36.849 --> 17:41.353
Not your strong virtue,
if I remember right, Gordon.

17:42.438 --> 17:45.149
State wrestling champ,
Academy running back.

17:45.566 --> 17:47.401
Why this place
and not a sports scholarship?

17:47.568 --> 17:49.778
People from my neighborhood
don't get scholarships.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.989
They join gangs, sell drugs.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.533
I needed to change the direction
my life was going.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.368
Mr. Martinez,

17:56.744 --> 17:59.037
it says here you're the best shot
this school's ever seen.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.414
<i>Where'd you learn to shoot?</i>

18:00.581 --> 18:01.874
Gotham Gun Range.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.501
One of my mother's three jobs
was cleaning it.

18:04.835 --> 18:07.337
When she died, the owner let me go there
after hours and practice,

18:07.504 --> 18:09.173
until I worked out my anger.

18:10.507 --> 18:11.759
I still go there.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.844
You're way too smart to be here, Garrett.

18:14.470 --> 18:16.597
Don't tell me, your father's a cop?

18:16.764 --> 18:17.973
Negative.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.435
My father's family business
was destroyed by armed thugs

18:21.602 --> 18:23.520
<i>who demanded he pay them protection money.</i>

18:23.771 --> 18:26.190
When he refused,
they beat him half to death.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.193
I'm here to make sure
that doesn't ever happen again.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.114
Garrett!

18:35.616 --> 18:36.742
<i>Pinkney!</i>

18:37.868 --> 18:39.077
<i>Josie!</i>

18:40.329 --> 18:41.872
<i>Martinez!</i>

18:45.918 --> 18:48.170
Do you swear to honor that badge
with your life?

18:48.337 --> 18:49.379
Yes, sir!

18:49.546 --> 18:51.006
Congratulations.

18:52.216 --> 18:56.011
You are now Unit Alpha
of the G.C.P.D. Strike Force,

18:56.178 --> 18:58.639
under the command
of Detective James Gordon.

18:58.806 --> 19:01.433
<i>You will answer only to him,
and him, only to me.</i>

19:01.600 --> 19:02.810
Dismissed.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.570
"Strike Force"?

19:14.404 --> 19:15.739
Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

19:15.906 --> 19:17.074
They're good kids.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.077
But facing what's out there
at their age...

19:21.578 --> 19:22.830
It's a big risk, sir.

19:23.038 --> 19:24.248
True.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.791
But what have we got to lose?

19:26.917 --> 19:28.085
Yes, sir.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.258
For your acts of courage

19:34.466 --> 19:37.261
in the face of overwhelming uncertainty,

19:37.511 --> 19:41.223
the city of Gotham would like to
give you this token of appreciation.

19:41.723 --> 19:44.184
The Medal of Valor and Bravery.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.987
- Mr. Galavan...
- Uh...

19:55.571 --> 19:56.780
Please, "Theo."

19:56.947 --> 20:00.075
Theo, for Pete's sake,
why aren't you running for mayor?

20:02.619 --> 20:04.621
Get down!

20:09.877 --> 20:11.420
Everybody, stay where you are!

20:11.795 --> 20:13.130
<i>Everyone okay?</i>

20:13.672 --> 20:14.840
<i>Everyone?</i>

20:18.135 --> 20:19.261
<i>You know what?</i>

20:20.470 --> 20:23.891
<i>Gothamites don't buckle under pressure,
and neither will I.</i>

20:24.766 --> 20:27.227
<i>We will not be intimidated by the scum</i>

20:27.644 --> 20:30.981
<i>that seek to reduce this
great city of Gotham to ruins.</i>

20:31.315 --> 20:34.067
<i>If the bad guys want to stop me running,</i>

20:34.318 --> 20:36.987
<i>well, then, I guess I got no choice.</i>

20:38.488 --> 20:41.116
<i>I will run for Mayor!</i>

20:41.325 --> 20:42.659
Yes!

20:56.506 --> 20:58.508
Hello? Caulfield for Mayor.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.011
<i>Yes. Will do.</i>

21:01.303 --> 21:03.138
Excuse me! You can't go in there!

21:10.187 --> 21:12.189
Miss Caulfield,
what a pleasure.

21:12.856 --> 21:14.650
Allow me to introduce myself.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.987
I can see what you are.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.031
How did you get in?

21:22.282 --> 21:26.244
I know it's late,
but I'm afraid there's no time for delay.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.664
Someone tried to kill
Theo Galavan this morning.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.207
Are you here to kill me?

21:30.374 --> 21:31.625
Actually, yes.

21:32.209 --> 21:34.127
Please, no.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.713
I'm a mother.

21:37.172 --> 21:39.925
- Wait!
- I have a mother, too.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.222
Steady now, folks.

21:45.389 --> 21:48.600
<i>- No!</i>
- Just think of blue skies and cornfields.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.018
<i>That's what I do.</i>

21:50.560 --> 21:52.312
Why are you doing this?

21:53.230 --> 21:55.732
Darling, I got no freaking idea.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.236
We've been doing crazy stuff all day long.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.497
Well, we're away, then.

22:10.664 --> 22:12.207
Sorry to ruin your evening.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.501
Now, remember...

22:15.919 --> 22:18.463
Yeah, I got your names and addresses.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.091
So, think about your families
and keep mum, eh?

22:47.492 --> 22:49.036
That's Bruce Wayne, right?

22:55.959 --> 22:57.252
Are you waiting for someone?

22:58.295 --> 22:59.421
No.

23:04.176 --> 23:05.302
That's your job.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.224
That's for Reggie.

23:13.643 --> 23:14.978
I know you killed him.

23:16.063 --> 23:17.814
Now, I don't know what you want
with Master Bruce,

23:17.981 --> 23:20.150
but I'm certain

23:20.317 --> 23:23.361
that his life's gonna be
a damn sight better without you in it.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.491
So, you do yourself a favor, treacle,

23:29.576 --> 23:30.952
and jog on.

23:34.164 --> 23:35.373
All good.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.508
Oh, Master Bruce.

23:45.217 --> 23:48.011
You know, I could always
pull out front, if you want.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.471
No, I...

23:49.638 --> 23:51.264
Alfred, I don't want
the other kids to see--

23:51.431 --> 23:55.060
To see that you've got a butler.
Yeah, I completely understand that.

23:55.727 --> 23:58.230
<i>I made dinner reservations,
as requested, for tomorrow night.</i>

23:58.688 --> 24:01.900
Mr. Galavan suggested the Regal Hotel.

24:02.651 --> 24:03.819
<i>Very posh.</i>

24:03.985 --> 24:05.987
You're gonna be forking out
serious dosh for that, I'll tell you.

24:06.363 --> 24:09.866
He saved my life.
Dinner's the least I can do to repay him.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.332
Uh, Master Bruce.

24:17.707 --> 24:18.834
Where are you going?

24:23.046 --> 24:25.715
Now, I clocked Wayne Manor
at exactly six and a half miles.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.384
It should take 90 minutes to two hours,

24:27.551 --> 24:29.886
depending on how many times
you stop, of course.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.013
I know you said you wanted to train.

24:32.514 --> 24:33.640
<i>To prepare.</i>

24:35.058 --> 24:36.268
Well, this is it.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.272
Wait, you...

24:40.730 --> 24:42.107
You expect me to walk?

24:43.066 --> 24:46.778
No, Master Bruce. I expect you to run.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.415
Miss Kringle,

24:59.457 --> 25:02.210
ever since I first laid eyes on you,
I've felt this deep connection.

25:03.795 --> 25:05.755
Perhaps you've felt it, too.

25:07.174 --> 25:09.176
Not cheesy.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.429
Miss Kringle,

25:12.637 --> 25:15.765
you've perhaps
felt my affections from afar.

25:15.932 --> 25:18.685
"Afar"? Really? Oh, God.

25:20.770 --> 25:22.147
Miss Kringle...

25:24.691 --> 25:26.109
Be quiet.

25:27.736 --> 25:29.237
I don't need your opinion.

25:29.446 --> 25:33.283
And what you need is to stop mumbling
and fumbling and tell her what's up!

25:33.450 --> 25:35.535
Well, she's been bullied
and taken for granted for too long.

25:35.785 --> 25:39.831
- And I want her to understand--
- You saved her life, for God's sake!

25:40.540 --> 25:41.917
She owes you.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.045
Take what you deserve.

25:58.725 --> 26:02.187
Miss. Kringle. Dinner, tonight.

26:02.812 --> 26:03.813
Um...

26:04.147 --> 26:06.316
Chez Moi. 8:00.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.863
Okay. I'd like that.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.281
You will.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.828
What?

26:20.163 --> 26:24.501
A wise cop once said,
"If you catch a kid smashing a window,

26:24.918 --> 26:27.045
"even a small one, bust him.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.423
"If you let it slide,
he'll smash another one.

26:31.466 --> 26:34.844
"Then he'll tag a wall, steal a bike,

26:35.136 --> 26:37.597
"rob a store, maybe hold someone up.

26:38.098 --> 26:40.934
"Crime unpunished is a crime in itself."

26:41.977 --> 26:43.687
This city is bleeding to death

26:44.771 --> 26:47.482
<i>from the amount of free passes
we hand out.</i>

26:47.649 --> 26:49.526
<i>Time to put a tourniquet over that wound.</i>

26:49.776 --> 26:54.322
From now on, no one gets a free pass.

26:56.199 --> 26:57.575
What is this strike force for?

26:58.868 --> 27:03.873
<i>To send a message that this epidemic
of lawlessness will no longer be treated,</i>

27:04.040 --> 27:05.667
but extinguished.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.044
With extreme prejudice.

27:08.420 --> 27:13.383
Gentlemen, lady, your new uniforms.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.890
Sir, got a caller,

27:21.057 --> 27:24.102
says Councilor Caulfield has been
attacked. Says she's dead.

27:34.321 --> 27:35.989
<i>You got an extra pair of gloves?</i>

27:38.575 --> 27:40.076
No security cameras.

27:40.827 --> 27:44.205
Galavan, and now her.
Looks like a damn pattern.

27:44.998 --> 27:46.416
Only, she's dead.

27:48.293 --> 27:49.753
Come on, people.

27:50.211 --> 27:51.421
Who knows what?

27:51.921 --> 27:55.925
Just give us a name, a description.
You will not have to testify.

27:58.053 --> 28:00.388
They have our names and addresses.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.393
All right, ma'am,
so could you show me your...

28:09.356 --> 28:11.566
Miss Caulfield was stabbed repeatedly.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.277
Probably drowned in her own blood.

28:18.281 --> 28:19.407
Forget it, Jim.

28:22.202 --> 28:26.331
The man with the knife
was short, fancy clothes,

28:27.374 --> 28:28.708
walked funny.

28:41.805 --> 28:44.265
Mr. Galavan, thank you for meeting me.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.434
It's an honor, the pleasure's all mine.

28:47.060 --> 28:49.479
- I'll meet you in the lobby, Master Bruce.
- Oh, why not dine with us?

28:50.063 --> 28:52.607
That's very kind of you, sir,
but I don't think it's appropriate.

28:52.774 --> 28:55.777
And I know that Master Bruce
wants to speak to you on his own.

28:57.445 --> 28:58.696
Sir?

29:00.031 --> 29:01.199
Thanks, Alfred.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.161
Enjoy.

29:08.415 --> 29:09.666
You like this place?

29:11.668 --> 29:13.002
I've never been here before.

29:13.837 --> 29:15.839
To be honest, I don't go out much.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.632
Well, I hope I can change that.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.510
There's always some tedious function
I could drag you to.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.763
I just...
I wanted this opportunity to thank you

29:24.347 --> 29:25.890
in person for saving my life.

29:26.391 --> 29:27.600
Oh, you're very kind.

29:28.351 --> 29:30.854
The truth is,
I don't know what came over me.

29:31.020 --> 29:34.357
I don't think I was in complete control
of my faculties.

29:35.024 --> 29:38.987
I also wanted to speak with you
face-to-face.

29:39.863 --> 29:41.823
It's regarding your parents' passing.

29:43.867 --> 29:47.162
I find it astonishing that the police have
failed to produce any evidence

29:47.328 --> 29:49.414
or any real suspect in all this time.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.292
It is disappointing.

29:52.459 --> 29:55.295
Even your father's own company,
Wayne Enterprises,

29:55.462 --> 29:57.881
<i>has failed to advance the investigation
in any way.</i>

29:58.047 --> 29:59.382
It's shocking.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.845
Yes, Mr. Galavan, it's very disappointing.

30:09.350 --> 30:10.477
That's Silver.

30:11.561 --> 30:12.562
I'm sorry?

30:12.729 --> 30:14.397
Silver St. Cloud.

30:14.564 --> 30:16.065
Her father was my stepbrother.

30:16.232 --> 30:19.235
<i>He passed, sadly. She's my ward now.</i>

30:21.613 --> 30:23.031
Would you like to meet her?

30:26.326 --> 30:27.368
Yes.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.293
Hello, my dear.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.587
Uncle.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.090
I'd like to introduce you to Bruce Wayne.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.636
- Nice to meet you, Bruce.
- Hello.

30:46.012 --> 30:49.557
I was early, so I came out here.
It's such a warm day.

30:50.016 --> 30:54.270
Do you know, I do believe that you two
will be sharing a school soon.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.481
Anders Prep, yes?

30:56.981 --> 31:00.109
<i>Silver just got back to Gotham
after two years abroad.</i>

31:00.610 --> 31:02.987
Switzerland, Geneva. Ugh.

31:04.155 --> 31:06.157
Yes. We have a house there.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.409
So, what's it like?

31:08.993 --> 31:10.995
- Switzerland?
- No, Prep, silly.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.248
I think it's fine.

31:13.414 --> 31:14.791
I've been homeschooling
for quite a while now.

31:14.958 --> 31:17.377
So, I'm virtually a new boy, too.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.547
Then we shall brave it together.

31:59.252 --> 32:01.504
I was kind of expecting a restaurant.

32:02.171 --> 32:05.174
Miss Kringle, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.

32:06.009 --> 32:07.510
Uh... I like to cook.

32:08.011 --> 32:09.387
I'm a good cook. Is that okay?

32:09.554 --> 32:14.267
It is, it is. Uh, and perhaps
you should call me Kristen.

32:15.518 --> 32:16.561
Kristen.

32:25.361 --> 32:28.197
Hobbs' campaign office
is the entire second floor.

32:29.699 --> 32:30.783
You sure about this?

32:31.659 --> 32:33.786
Don't worry, I've got it under control.

32:36.623 --> 32:38.625
Okay, you gotta tell me
what the hell's going on.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.711
I know I gotta do whatever you say,

32:42.503 --> 32:45.006
but at least tell me
why the hell we're doing it.

32:47.592 --> 32:49.469
- They have my mother, Butch.
- Who?

32:49.927 --> 32:53.473
Galavan and his sister. They have her.

32:54.265 --> 32:55.600
They're making me do this.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.311
Holy smokes.

32:59.646 --> 33:00.980
We gotta find your mom.

33:02.190 --> 33:05.568
If they find out we're looking,
they'll hurt her.

33:07.737 --> 33:09.322
Don't worry. We'll find her.

33:15.745 --> 33:18.414
He's here. Let's go.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.376
Got it. Thanks.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.630
I still think we should move you
somewhere a little more secure.

33:25.797 --> 33:26.798
Forget it.

33:26.964 --> 33:28.758
Anyone has the guts to come after me,

33:28.925 --> 33:31.219
they'll find out real soon
who they're messing with.

33:33.429 --> 33:35.056
<i>All right,
sweep around. Whoa, oh, oh.</i>

33:46.484 --> 33:47.944
Who the hell are you?

33:48.986 --> 33:50.154
Oh.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.740
I came here to volunteer.

33:53.366 --> 33:55.326
Well, run back to whoever hired you.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.912
<i>Tell them I'm not going anywhere.</i>

33:58.287 --> 33:59.747
This city needs me.

34:00.873 --> 34:01.874
Oh.

34:02.333 --> 34:03.459
Cool pins.

34:07.922 --> 34:09.257
Count, idiot.

34:09.549 --> 34:10.883
There's five of us.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.636
I know, hardly seems fair.

34:27.316 --> 34:29.193
Move, move, move, move, move! Go!

34:43.124 --> 34:44.250
Keep going.

34:44.417 --> 34:48.004
There you go. Right there! Go!

34:48.212 --> 34:50.923
<i>G.C.P.D.! Put down your weapons!</i>

35:07.106 --> 35:09.484
Fan out! Flank him from both sides,
catch him in our cross fire.

35:09.650 --> 35:11.194
Yeah, do that.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.695
I'll cover you! Go!

35:17.200 --> 35:19.410
Okay, so, they move well.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.351
Unexpected.

35:47.396 --> 35:48.731
Move, move, move.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.366
Let's go.

36:02.119 --> 36:03.412
The shooter got away, sir.

36:05.915 --> 36:07.542
You just met Victor Zsasz.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.919
Works for Penguin these days.

36:10.461 --> 36:12.588
What the hell is Penguin playing at?

36:21.138 --> 36:24.267
No, but I... I feel like, uh,
I owe you an apology.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.727
I feel as though I have been
nothing but mean to you.

36:26.894 --> 36:28.271
No, I don't think that's fair.

36:28.938 --> 36:30.773
I feel like all I've ever done
is annoy you.

36:32.567 --> 36:33.901
I've been consistently inappropriate.

36:34.068 --> 36:35.570
No, no, no, no, no, it's me.

36:35.736 --> 36:40.533
You have been nothing but sweet.
And I ignored your card, and your gifts.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.451
Miss Kringle, I can honestly say

36:43.327 --> 36:45.955
that our interactions are
always the highlight of my day.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.457
Please, uh, "Kristen."

36:49.125 --> 36:52.670
Oh, my God, I even accused you of
writing Dougherty's good-bye note.

36:52.837 --> 36:55.840
Right. Crazy.

36:56.007 --> 36:57.717
I mean, oh, who knows
what that jerk was thinking?

36:57.884 --> 36:58.885
Jerk.

36:59.051 --> 37:02.054
How I ever let him lay a hand on me,
I'll never know.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.431
I'm glad he's dead.

37:09.312 --> 37:10.438
Well, he's...

37:11.480 --> 37:13.983
He just left town, he's not dead.

37:14.150 --> 37:15.484
Right, yeah, I know.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.446
Figure of speech.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.281
He's dead to you.

37:20.823 --> 37:22.533
Out of your life. Not "dead" dead.

37:26.954 --> 37:28.164
Um...

37:29.707 --> 37:31.167
I'm gonna use the restroom.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.512
You blew it, dummy. Nice work.

37:43.679 --> 37:44.847
Leave me alone!

37:45.014 --> 37:46.599
Are you talking to me?

37:48.267 --> 37:49.435
No.

37:50.186 --> 37:52.355
Honestly, Kristen,
I wasn't talking to you.

37:52.521 --> 37:53.731
Who else is there?

37:54.231 --> 37:57.652
I talk to myself.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.655
It's crazy, I know, just...
I have this, uh...

38:02.615 --> 38:04.533
I have this voice inside my head,

38:04.825 --> 38:07.495
a sort of stronger version of me,
that keeps this me in line,

38:07.662 --> 38:08.913
because I'm such a klutz.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.044
I can understand that.

38:17.046 --> 38:20.049
I think that we all have
a voice like that.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.052
You think?

38:23.511 --> 38:24.929
What was your inner voice saying?

38:25.346 --> 38:27.431
He was mad at me for spoiling the mood.

38:27.682 --> 38:29.141
Mmm-hmm.

38:30.184 --> 38:31.811
It was... It was a really nice mood.

38:34.647 --> 38:38.150
But my inner voice is telling me that

38:39.068 --> 38:41.237
I think maybe we can get back there.

39:34.248 --> 39:35.583
You killed Caulfield.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.585
<i>We have a witness.</i>

39:39.628 --> 39:41.547
And the attempt on Galavan?
Was that you, too?

39:41.714 --> 39:43.591
- Not now.
- And Hobbs?

39:44.258 --> 39:47.386
- You sent Zsasz there?
- It's complicated! Okay?

39:47.595 --> 39:49.889
What does it profit you
to mess with the election?

39:50.264 --> 39:52.641
<i>You have your own
sordid empire to rule over.</i>

39:54.977 --> 39:57.313
Walk away, Jim. Let me be.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.524
The G.C.P.D. has new leadership.

40:00.983 --> 40:03.152
<i>No more deals, no more favors.</i>

40:03.611 --> 40:05.488
If they find out
you're behind these attacks,

40:05.654 --> 40:09.033
- we will come after you--
- Rousing speech! Really.

40:09.867 --> 40:11.202
Goose bumps.

40:12.745 --> 40:15.081
But you came here alone, Jim.

40:15.831 --> 40:19.335
<i>With no warrant, no cuffs,
no backup, and why?</i>

40:19.543 --> 40:22.213
Because you would hate
for your new captain to find out

40:22.379 --> 40:26.550
about how you gunned down
Ogden Barker in cold blood.

40:27.468 --> 40:28.928
<i>Over a debt.</i>

40:29.970 --> 40:32.014
A debt to me.

40:32.807 --> 40:34.058
He was trying to kill me.

40:35.935 --> 40:37.353
Where are your witnesses?

40:38.187 --> 40:39.980
And just that day before,

40:40.147 --> 40:42.858
I suppose you did not ask me

40:43.025 --> 40:46.695
to run Commissioner Loeb out of town
so that you could get your old job back?

41:02.128 --> 41:03.629
I'll face whatever's coming to me.

41:04.130 --> 41:05.422
As will I.

41:06.382 --> 41:07.424
<i>Good-bye, Jim.</i>

41:17.351 --> 41:19.103
- Obviously.
- I don't think so.

41:19.562 --> 41:21.021
- I'm serious.
- For a second--

41:21.188 --> 41:23.399
Hey, you shouldn't be joking
about near misses.

41:24.108 --> 41:26.152
Next bullet might get stuck
right in your eye.

41:26.986 --> 41:28.112
Yes, sir.

41:28.571 --> 41:29.738
No joking.

41:30.072 --> 41:31.574
<i>All right. Gather around.</i>

41:34.702 --> 41:39.081
Today, I'm giving the Strike Force
its first real mission.

41:39.915 --> 41:43.419
Build a case to put away
Gotham's enemy number one.

41:46.213 --> 41:48.007
Time to take down the Penguin.

42:03.731 --> 42:04.773
Bruce!

42:16.577 --> 42:18.579
Hey, Selina, come on, let's go!

42:20.873 --> 42:22.458
<i>I don't know what you want
with Master Bruce,</i>

42:22.625 --> 42:24.001
<i>but I'm certain</i>

42:24.168 --> 42:27.463
<i>that his life's gonna be a damn sight
better without you in it.</i>

42:29.632 --> 42:33.552
So, what do you think? Red? Or Blue?

42:33.969 --> 42:35.387
- Red.
- Blue.

42:36.472 --> 42:38.557
- Blue it is.
- I want some fun.

42:39.016 --> 42:40.684
I'm sick of staying indoors.

42:42.019 --> 42:45.189
Patience, Barbara. Your time will come.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.734
The wheel is turning.

42:50.611 --> 42:53.405
While the G.C.P.D. chase the Penguin,

42:53.572 --> 42:58.452
<i>I'll steal the mayor's office
right from under their noses.</i>

43:01.330 --> 43:02.498
Did you find her?

44:02.975 --> 44:03.976
English - SDH
