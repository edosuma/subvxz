00:32.680 --> 00:33.829
Go, go!

00:36.840 --> 00:38.910
You have the fire, please?

00:40.960 --> 00:42.109
Thank you.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.194
Hurry!

00:45.000 --> 00:46.035
Wait!

01:42.400 --> 01:43.276
It's a doll!

01:51.200 --> 01:52.076
Stop!

04:00.720 --> 04:02.438
What a beautiful place!

04:03.080 --> 04:05.389
Look, this is the Spanish fort.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.632
It dominates the whole Gulf.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.071
You were there with your brother, Fritz?

04:10.280 --> 04:12.669
From here, there is nothing strange.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.550
It is mysterious and we were young.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.795
I remember once, in summer.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.670
We found a dead dog.
Someone ...

04:22.960 --> 04:23.631
Stop!

04:24.520 --> 04:26.431
Someone had strangled.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.119
It was awful.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.673
I wanted to vomit.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.313
- If Fritz ...
- Stop!

04:38.640 --> 04:41.473
Christian, look at that girl,
there!

05:05.480 --> 05:06.151
Who are you?

05:06.360 --> 05:08.112
- What do you want?
- Help you.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.231
I thought ... Come on!

05:11.000 --> 05:12.558
You seemed dead.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.113
What happened to you?

05:14.320 --> 05:17.039
Sunstroke, maybe ...

05:17.240 --> 05:19.196
I had fainted, I do not know.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.232
You feel better?

05:23.560 --> 05:25.437
Yes, okay, it happened.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.792
In fact, it's me Barbara.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.831
I am Xenia, he is Christian.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.158
- You need a scotch.
- I'm going.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.077
It is not safe
to leave two women alone.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.836
You thought I was dead?

05:42.120 --> 05:43.599
There was talk of a crime.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.313
A dog strangled.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.478
If we change the subject?

05:50.920 --> 05:53.229
You are right. You are here?

05:54.680 --> 05:55.510
Oh, I ...

05:55.720 --> 05:59.395
Christian, I do not find it.
Come, please!

05:59.600 --> 06:00.794
Excuse me.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.874
Why is she gone?

06:23.480 --> 06:24.879
Ask him.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.469
Let's see.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.191
Tucania. What's this?

06:30.400 --> 06:33.437
An Etruscan necropolis
or the name of a bird?

06:52.400 --> 06:53.196
Hello?

06:54.200 --> 06:54.950
Yes.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.714
That's me.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.392
What's his name?

07:04.480 --> 07:05.708
Tucania.

07:16.120 --> 07:16.870
Hello!

07:17.160 --> 07:17.876
Well, your bag!

07:18.080 --> 07:20.799
Thank you Carlo. See you later.

07:21.000 --> 07:21.750
Hello!

07:24.400 --> 07:26.118
Hello everybody!

07:26.560 --> 07:27.436
Hello, okay?

07:27.640 --> 07:28.470
Well, do you?

07:29.080 --> 07:32.231
- Want a drink?
- Certainly.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.471
- Cheers Barbara.
- Chin.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.956
If this were planted fuckers?

07:42.160 --> 07:44.355
- Alex, you're crazy!
- Come on!

08:01.720 --> 08:05.030
Beautiful boat, beautiful feast
beautiful day ...

08:05.640 --> 08:06.390
Thank you.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.160
This is said
when you're bored, right?

08:09.760 --> 08:12.228
What are you doing here?
We do not know.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.795
I was passing by,
I saw written Tucania.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.195
What is a bird?

08:17.400 --> 08:19.118
No, a yacht. Mine.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.109
You know Barbara?

08:21.320 --> 08:22.070
Why?

08:23.280 --> 08:25.316
You look at her strangely.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.113
Really?

08:27.400 --> 08:29.311
You do not have an aspirin?

08:29.520 --> 08:30.873
You feel bad?

08:31.080 --> 08:33.035
Yes, very. You're in luck!

08:34.159 --> 08:37.038
I have a headache,
you'll be quiet!

08:37.440 --> 08:38.190
Christiani

08:38.760 --> 08:40.432
I offer you a drink?

08:42.760 --> 08:45.718
Come, I'll find you
aspirin.

08:51.040 --> 08:51.870
Are you angry?

08:54.120 --> 08:56.270
You want to know
why I left?

08:59.160 --> 09:00.195
Who is Alex?

09:00.880 --> 09:02.393
Call it a friend,

09:02.600 --> 09:06.479
rich, possessive, friendly

09:06.680 --> 09:08.511
and a little in love with me.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.719
Poor.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.953
Kindness is not your strong point.

09:15.160 --> 09:15.990
I know.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.030
But with you
I want to be nice,

09:20.000 --> 09:21.399
tender and delicate.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.071
I am not used to that.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.350
That's because you really like me.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.995
You do not deny yourself anything, you.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.436
The moon

09:36.720 --> 09:38.358
it does not bother you?

09:38.560 --> 09:39.470
My motel

09:39.760 --> 09:40.636
we do not see it.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.149
I knew,
you're a fucking sweet.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.158
Well, go to your motel.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.199
First, cut your beard.

09:49.160 --> 09:49.910
What?

09:50.120 --> 09:51.155
Yes!

09:51.360 --> 09:54.875
The sweet whore does not pay
but she has her whims.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.877
Are you crazy?
I give you a check right away,

09:59.440 --> 10:00.634
and I keep my beard.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.311
I have a razor in my room.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.193
Chic, sexy and discreet.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.713
- What do you have?
- A tract.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.348
Come on.

11:08.920 --> 11:09.670
Here it is.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.119
You're not serious?

11:12.320 --> 11:15.517
The beard spades, irritates the skin,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.394
and may reserve
surprises.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.794
Sure.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.560
As a fugitive
who hides his face.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.079
What is your work?

11:25.280 --> 11:26.395
I do not work.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.319
I am the majority shareholder
of the society of my brother.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.991
I beg too?

11:35.120 --> 11:37.236
You can ask me whatever you want.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.591
As you shave,
I will create a little atmosphere.

11:40.960 --> 11:41.995
N'Ã©teins not all.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.628
No, not at all!

12:32.840 --> 12:34.239
You've changed your mind?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.389
You know what?

12:38.240 --> 12:41.789
You keep your beard and you go away.
This game is stupid.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.315
No, it's a fantastic game!

12:45.520 --> 12:46.999
I will not go away,

12:47.280 --> 12:48.429
even if you kill me.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.915
OK, but hurry up.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.395
You're an amazing woman,

13:40.040 --> 13:41.553
who can work miracles.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.316
Shut the door, would you?

14:20.480 --> 14:21.230
Who are you?

14:22.080 --> 14:23.035
Hush!

14:25.560 --> 14:26.788
What do you want?

14:27.360 --> 14:28.349
There was an error.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.118
No, there is no error.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.712
That's for the girl.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.353
If it's for Barbara ...

14:36.160 --> 14:37.513
What do you mean what?

14:37.720 --> 14:40.314
This bitch against your skin?
You're a skunk!

15:18.160 --> 15:18.910
Do not move!

15:20.400 --> 15:21.719
Do not jerk!

15:22.800 --> 15:25.189
Neither do you.
Why you wanted to kill me?

15:36.960 --> 15:39.554
You are being demolished
my bathroom?

15:48.640 --> 15:49.390
Something wrong?

15:57.360 --> 15:58.554
What's up?

16:00.640 --> 16:02.278
I killed a man.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.511
You're kidding!

16:05.960 --> 16:07.598
No, it's true.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.360
He jumped on me
and a shot was fired.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.790
He may have wanted ...

16:15.520 --> 16:16.589
Come see!

16:16.960 --> 16:18.313
You know, perhaps!

16:18.840 --> 16:21.593
No, I do not have the courage.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.674
I'm afraid. Call the police.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.750
It's hard to explain.
They will not believe me.

16:28.960 --> 16:29.551
Sure.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.318
Wait, we will tell them what?

16:32.640 --> 16:34.437
This is my brother whom I call.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.358
Do not call. Neither he nor the police.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.710
Call no one for now.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.634
Let's go!

16:42.840 --> 16:45.991
We need to think about
before making a decision.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.270
Want to run?

16:47.560 --> 16:48.197
Yes.

16:49.040 --> 16:49.995
Do not stop here.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.396
Find an alibi.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.194
It's too difficult to explain,
you said.

17:07.119 --> 17:07.996
Hurry!

17:29.400 --> 17:31.550
No domestic scenes, OK?

17:32.680 --> 17:35.148
This is not the right place.
Let's go!

17:35.720 --> 17:36.869
What do you want?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.833
- Come with me!
- You have no right!

17:40.120 --> 17:41.951
You've already got what you wanted.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.510
Come on up!

17:48.000 --> 17:50.309
Wait, where do you take it?

17:50.520 --> 17:51.714
We'll drink a glass.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.273
Come with us.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.597
We need to be explained
after what happened.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.630
Is not it?

18:24.120 --> 18:27.749
You do not realize
it's a stupid game and useless?

18:27.960 --> 18:29.678
What do you hope to achieve?

18:29.880 --> 18:30.630
You.

18:31.880 --> 18:34.394
Go Christian
do not look.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.397
Looks
you just see a dead body.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.554
How?

18:41.440 --> 18:42.793
You did very well understood.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.639
- It is you who organized everything!
- Christian!

18:46.480 --> 18:49.836
Let us behave
as civilized people.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.675
Tomorrow you come to Monte Carlo
with me.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.515
A holiday will do you good.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.714
My Channel!

18:58.920 --> 19:01.639
I must have left it there!

19:04.800 --> 19:07.109
So you, you go with me,

19:07.400 --> 19:09.311
Christian and decamp.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.315
That we avoid other problems.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.673
Well here, bravo!

19:17.840 --> 19:20.229
It is less reckless
it looks.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.832
- Where did you find?
- She was tied to a tree,

20:39.160 --> 20:41.116
with a knife in the belly.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.073
- Hello?
<i>- Yes</i>

20:45.000 --> 20:46.194
Christian at the camera.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.038
My brother is still there?

20:48.240 --> 20:49.389
<i>this hour?</i>

20:49.600 --> 20:52.160
<i>No, there's only me,
the goalkeeper.</i>

20:52.360 --> 20:54.510
<i>Try tomorrow morning.</i>

21:03.840 --> 21:04.909
What are you doing here?

21:05.120 --> 21:06.678
I ran away.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.677
I've been looking and I saw you.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.794
And your chain?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.114
The body ...

21:15.320 --> 21:18.869
The body of this man is gone
he disappeared!

21:20.240 --> 21:21.639
But it's impossible!

21:22.920 --> 21:25.639
Even the gun has disappeared.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.070
But then you did not kill him!

21:28.280 --> 21:30.111
He was wounded and he fled.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.709
Either he is dead
and was transported.

21:32.920 --> 21:33.875
An accomplice?

21:34.080 --> 21:35.911
This is all so absurd.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.031
Absurd and dangerous.

21:38.240 --> 21:41.550
Perhaps
he was looking for someone else.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.034
It changes nothing.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.959
Maybe Alex who sent it.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.278
It's too dangerous, go away!

21:50.160 --> 21:53.232
Do not worry,
now it's too late.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.950
Even if it had not happened
home, I would have helped.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.752
You do not realize!

21:58.960 --> 22:01.474
If it is just hurt,
he will try again.

22:02.400 --> 22:06.359
But if he is dead,
and if he had an accomplice,

22:07.040 --> 22:10.396
it would be even worse,
you would be hunted down by a stranger.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.555
I stay with you.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.239
I beg you, Barbara!

22:14.440 --> 22:17.671
We need to save time
and hide, but where?

22:22.760 --> 22:26.230
One of my friends
has a property, not far from here.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.591
A Brazilian artist,
it is in Rio at the moment.

22:29.920 --> 22:30.796
You have the keys?

22:32.240 --> 22:33.798
No, but it's easy to enter.

22:34.080 --> 22:34.956
You'll see.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.030
I'll say it again, save yourself.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.715
No, we'll pull together.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.675
Gently!
We could hear us.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.236
Do not be alarmed now,
I told you there was nobody.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.353
I do not like this place.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.630
There is something scary.

23:12.840 --> 23:16.594
- Let us start from here.
- Christian, do not be childish.

23:21.680 --> 23:22.510
You have a jack?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.798
Compensation will my friend
for the tile.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.554
Thou hast well said
that your friend was a painter?

23:46.760 --> 23:47.715
Yes, why?

23:47.920 --> 23:50.878
This place is so commonplace.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.750
At least there was scotch.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.314
Looks
someone has to drink.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.351
Surely the keeper.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.755
It should change from time to time,

24:05.040 --> 24:06.109
to verify.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.516
Should not have answered.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.758
Come take a look.

25:30.240 --> 25:33.277
Angelita passion
for raptors.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.712
I'll unplug the phone.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.555
Nobody will look here.

25:42.040 --> 25:42.790
There.

25:44.840 --> 25:45.556
Barbara!

25:45.760 --> 25:46.829
I'm coming!

25:48.560 --> 25:49.310
Hurry!

25:49.640 --> 25:51.437
- What's up?
- Look.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.469
We spy.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.231
He can not we have seen,

25:58.440 --> 26:00.396
the car is on the other side.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.034
We spy.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.074
You saw?

26:23.400 --> 26:24.594
I do not know ...

26:24.800 --> 26:27.439
It must be a coincidence,
remain calm.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.277
We are safe here.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.748
Go.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.110
This is probably a tourist

26:35.720 --> 26:39.156
which rose by chance
and looked.

26:40.040 --> 26:41.473
But he looked at us!

26:42.040 --> 26:43.109
Nay

28:09.160 --> 28:12.835
There is nothing to do
they had to cut the power.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.110
We can not remain in the dark.

28:16.120 --> 28:20.079
There must be
a switch, but where?

28:21.520 --> 28:22.999
Maybe in the garage?

28:24.160 --> 28:26.037
Yes, I'll go see.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.514
I'll be right back.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.354
Wait!

28:29.840 --> 28:31.558
I prefer to go with you.

28:56.240 --> 28:56.990
Look.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.111
I'm scared!

29:45.280 --> 29:46.633
It's just the wind!

29:55.360 --> 29:56.429
Do not move!

29:59.480 --> 30:00.549
Who are you?

30:01.760 --> 30:02.590
What do you want?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.355
It's mine
you ask.

30:05.560 --> 30:06.629
You are with us.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.872
This house is not yours!

30:09.400 --> 30:11.470
True, but I live there.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.113
I rented it for a month.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.719
Is not it, Clorinda?

30:14.920 --> 30:15.989
Yes, of course.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.670
My name is Malcolm.

30:18.960 --> 30:22.032
I treat you as guests,
How strange, no?

30:22.800 --> 30:25.598
You look scared. Why?

30:25.800 --> 30:27.597
You were going to commit a crime?

30:35.960 --> 30:39.077
So you know
The owner, Miss ...

30:39.280 --> 30:40.918
- What is your name?
- Barbara.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.750
I love this place.

30:43.960 --> 30:47.396
It may sound absurd,
but I die here.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.229
Far from the world of chaos.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.830
If death
is that the continuity of life,

30:54.040 --> 30:55.075
is the ideal place.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.359
Why talk about death?

30:57.560 --> 31:00.711
It is because of what happened
last night.

31:00.920 --> 31:04.230
We were with an old friend,
police.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.989
It has been called urgently
in a motel near here.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.111
We went with him.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.357
And we've seen something
very impressive.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.194
It was I who killed him!

31:17.280 --> 31:18.315
That's me!

31:21.000 --> 31:24.549
He jumped on me
and a shot was fired.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.034
That's it, that's it.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.831
Really?

31:29.040 --> 31:32.749
Yes, but do not ask me
Who was that man.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.188
I do not know.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.753
But you were together.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.191
You are sure of having killed him?

31:39.760 --> 31:42.035
Yes, I shot,

31:43.160 --> 31:45.549
I saw him fall
and there was blood.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.876
It's a bad joke.

31:48.560 --> 31:51.233
- A joke?
- There has been no crime.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.633
I was talking to a doll,

31:55.400 --> 31:57.470
which resembled
a woman.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.114
It was found in a wood,

32:00.320 --> 32:01.469
a knife in his belly.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.072
But I have shot a man!

32:06.000 --> 32:07.035
This is the truth.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.753
I saw him with the revolver.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.154
You've seen it take?

32:12.640 --> 32:13.550
I saw him after.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.513
And the body of this man,
you've seen?

32:20.120 --> 32:20.950
No.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.708
No, but I saw Christian out.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.711
There's no corpse.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.911
I returned it was gone!

32:31.360 --> 32:33.749
Can sometimes
hallucinate.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.709
Feeling better?

33:08.680 --> 33:11.513
- Yes.
- Keep our composure.

33:12.280 --> 33:15.750
Christian should try
to find his brother.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.916
No, not now.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.156
I want to have the heart net.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.674
You know Alex?

33:23.080 --> 33:23.830
Who is it?

33:26.760 --> 33:28.193
Whatever.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.755
It is better from here
immediately.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.394
- Forget that you saw us.
- Impossible.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.955
You are here, and I've seen.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.159
So Bury Me!

33:40.080 --> 33:42.878
Call your friend policeman
and Bury me

33:43.080 --> 33:45.036
Finally the asylum with you?

33:45.240 --> 33:46.673
Do not talk nonsense.

33:46.880 --> 33:49.235
Your victim has disappeared.

33:49.920 --> 33:52.195
You accuse of a crime
that does not exist!

33:52.400 --> 33:54.675
There is no trace.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.550
I ...

34:07.680 --> 34:10.956
Excuse me
I feel mad.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.268
I want to know the truth!

34:15.120 --> 34:16.030
Wait!

34:16.239 --> 34:17.958
Let him go.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.193
He will return.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.118
Why are you following me?

35:34.920 --> 35:36.399
I am not following you.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.670
I'm going to see a friend in the lighthouse.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.595
If you are looking Tucania,
he is gone.

35:46.880 --> 35:47.915
For Monte Carlo.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.714
Finally! But where have you been?

36:49.760 --> 36:50.715
I was in port.

37:15.680 --> 37:16.396
What's going on?

37:16.600 --> 37:17.555
Stay calm.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.035
The generator must be broken.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.834
He has a way
for light!

37:23.480 --> 37:24.435
Hush!

37:24.920 --> 37:25.875
You hear?

37:26.760 --> 37:28.352
The ghosts of the tower!

37:30.280 --> 37:31.554
Stop!

37:32.680 --> 37:35.831
Only rats here.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.632
It might be better ...

37:37.840 --> 37:39.353
I'll go see.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.279
Meanwhile,
help yourself something to drink.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.792
We have become accustomed
leaving everything open.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.194
I've had enough.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.552
It only needed that!

38:05.440 --> 38:07.431
We were perhaps found.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.677
No, it's impossible!

38:15.200 --> 38:16.394
So?

38:18.640 --> 38:20.278
I'm sorry.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.311
The generator is down.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.556
It was not until tomorrow morning.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.554
I know you,
we have already seen.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.118
Christian
there is still time to leave.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.515
I'm tired
we leave tomorrow.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.676
Okay, as you want.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.431
Here is your room.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.278
I hope it pleases you.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.557
The bed is upstairs.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.954
And here is your key

39:07.400 --> 39:09.197
room is downstairs.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.396
- Good night.
- See you tomorrow.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.794
Good night.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.508
Where have you been?

39:19.000 --> 39:20.069
You were looking for Alex?

39:22.040 --> 39:25.157
You sure can
trust Malcolm?

39:25.880 --> 39:27.154
I do not know!

39:28.360 --> 39:29.952
I do not understand you.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.196
I do not understand anything.

39:34.880 --> 39:35.949
You're right.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.070
I'm really sorry, Barbara.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.311
I'm exhausted!

40:38.560 --> 40:40.710
My nerves that shed.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.111
Sorry for just now.

40:44.840 --> 40:47.559
The old man and the girl,

40:47.760 --> 40:50.149
I can not identify them.

40:51.360 --> 40:55.035
Indeed, they should not
Guest normal either.

40:58.560 --> 41:01.597
I do not know why,
but I do not like them.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.316
That's why I wanted to leave.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.879
You act as if ...

41:08.520 --> 41:11.637
you had something to tell me
but you say nothing.

41:12.880 --> 41:17.078
But you do not want to say
Do you really think!

41:18.040 --> 41:21.157
I do not like this Clorinda.

41:24.000 --> 41:24.750
Why?

41:27.880 --> 41:29.632
I do not know.

41:30.520 --> 41:31.873
You look,

41:32.080 --> 41:34.640
as if you knew.

41:34.920 --> 41:38.230
But I may be wrong.

41:38.440 --> 41:41.159
Me too
I'm getting on my nerves.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.634
Listen.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.108
- I need you.
- Go, Christian.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.194
In this sordid affair,

41:56.840 --> 41:59.115
I happened
something fantastic

41:59.320 --> 42:01.390
which does not happen every day.

42:01.760 --> 42:04.115
I met a woman like you,

42:04.480 --> 42:06.755
a real woman. You believe me?

42:08.120 --> 42:09.712
Of course I believe you.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.957
But I can not help you.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.037
You must rely on yourself.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.558
And in the background,

42:20.840 --> 42:23.798
you know almost nothing about me,
so I beg you,

42:25.520 --> 42:27.351
Now, go away!

42:36.000 --> 42:38.798
I am not a strong woman
Christian.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.637
We have little time.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.876
It is wrong and dangerous

43:40.160 --> 43:42.390
the mix with this story, Luca.

43:42.960 --> 43:45.918
- You've changed your mind?
- No, that's not it.

43:46.120 --> 43:48.509
In fact, I begin to fear.

43:48.720 --> 43:49.994
Who?

43:50.200 --> 43:52.270
You're afraid of that, what?

43:52.480 --> 43:55.119
What could happen.

43:55.320 --> 43:57.550
Do not worry, everything is calculated.

43:57.760 --> 44:01.116
There is no risk,
we cover.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.597
A hallucination
it can happen to everyone.

45:41.720 --> 45:43.438
But I am real.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.070
But you ...

45:59.520 --> 46:00.589
Yes

46:01.800 --> 46:03.916
Now I remember.

46:04.280 --> 46:05.759
At the time,

46:06.320 --> 46:08.515
you do not call you Clorinda.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.597
I must look like somebody.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.275
Remember,

46:12.480 --> 46:15.074
I was with my brother,
there two years.

46:15.480 --> 46:17.311
I do not see what you're talking,

46:18.120 --> 46:19.633
but whatever.

46:27.440 --> 46:28.555
You're strange.

46:28.840 --> 46:29.955
I have well observed.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.434
I'm not strange,

46:31.640 --> 46:34.279
- It is you who are!
- How?

46:36.680 --> 46:37.635
No, nothing.

46:37.840 --> 46:38.909
Explain yourself.

46:39.120 --> 46:41.588
Why did you come here,
alone?

46:42.040 --> 46:44.110
Just to say
you do not know me?

46:44.320 --> 46:46.515
I tell you that I live
This in turn

46:46.720 --> 46:48.392
I love flowers

46:48.600 --> 46:50.989
and night
I loose my hair.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.952
I did nothing wrong.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.038
You know all about Malcolm.

46:55.680 --> 46:56.908
Sure.

46:57.120 --> 46:59.076
But why talk now?

46:59.280 --> 47:01.077
Do not complicate things.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.111
I'm here to help.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.270
Look!

47:09.880 --> 47:11.518
Malcolm is a man.

47:11.720 --> 47:13.915
I see none.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.152
He, I say!

47:23.400 --> 47:24.355
Yes.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.193
I remember.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.152
It was also this time,

47:30.440 --> 47:31.555
the funeral.

47:31.840 --> 47:33.796
It never moves without me.

47:36.280 --> 47:37.918
What do you expect from me?

47:38.120 --> 47:39.678
You're hurting me!

47:40.640 --> 47:41.709
Go away.

47:42.440 --> 47:43.350
No!

47:44.160 --> 47:45.354
Wait.

47:45.880 --> 47:47.598
I prefer that you stay.

47:47.800 --> 47:49.438
Even if you're in their camp.

47:49.640 --> 47:50.959
Let me go.

47:51.680 --> 47:53.671
Let me go, please.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.508
Let me go.

47:58.840 --> 48:00.159
Please.

48:00.360 --> 48:00.997
No.

48:02.800 --> 48:03.755
Stop.

49:17.920 --> 49:19.353
What's up?

49:19.920 --> 49:20.830
Where is Barbara?

49:21.040 --> 49:24.237
I could not hold her,
it must be in the village.

49:24.440 --> 49:25.350
She said nothing?

49:25.920 --> 49:27.433
This is not your problem.

49:27.640 --> 49:30.473
Do not think about it, thinking of you.
Go away.

49:31.280 --> 49:33.555
I am living a nightmare since yesterday

49:33.760 --> 49:35.113
and you're gone!

49:35.400 --> 49:38.472
If you want to go out,
you must disappear

49:38.680 --> 49:39.669
few days.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.874
It's the only thing to do.

49:43.120 --> 49:46.237
Okay, but I must first
find Barbara.

49:46.440 --> 49:47.077
Christian

49:47.400 --> 49:48.389
tell me one thing,

49:48.600 --> 49:51.319
you distrust her,
or you need her?

49:57.240 --> 49:58.229
One moment.

49:59.640 --> 50:01.039
Now, I think

50:02.160 --> 50:04.276
I recognize you.

50:05.400 --> 50:09.916
It came back
suddenly last night.

50:11.560 --> 50:15.235
You see, I'm so mad
want to help.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.279
That's all that matters.

50:17.840 --> 50:18.909
Are you crazy?

50:19.560 --> 50:21.710
Why? There is a madman ...

50:22.360 --> 50:23.475
want to help me?

50:23.760 --> 50:25.796
You tried to join your brother?

50:26.920 --> 50:27.670
No.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.432
No, you know,

50:32.480 --> 50:35.438
I would like
leave me alone,

50:35.920 --> 50:39.117
without his help,
for the first time in my life.

50:39.320 --> 50:40.070
Good.

50:40.800 --> 50:42.597
Is that right? You're joking.

50:42.800 --> 50:43.755
No, I ...

50:43.960 --> 50:45.871
All this scares me.

50:46.760 --> 50:48.512
Fritz has always understood,

50:48.720 --> 50:51.075
He always helped me,
but this time ...

50:51.280 --> 50:53.510
I, too, when I saw you,

50:53.800 --> 50:54.710
yesterday evening

50:54.920 --> 50:56.956
I do not immediately returned.

50:57.160 --> 50:59.993
The mysterious death.

51:00.800 --> 51:03.314
And the court case that followed.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.833
These two children,
watching this tragedy.

51:07.520 --> 51:08.714
Yes, I know,

51:09.040 --> 51:11.759
you are involved in all this.
I must go.

51:17.320 --> 51:20.630
One child was called Fritz
another Christian.

51:23.640 --> 51:25.870
I was editor at the time.

51:26.080 --> 51:27.274
What struck me,

51:27.560 --> 51:29.516
in this strange case,

51:29.720 --> 51:32.280
was the expression
one of these children.

51:32.480 --> 51:33.230
And it was you.

51:34.160 --> 51:36.071
You always have the same expression,

51:36.280 --> 51:38.236
after so many years.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.030
But I loved my father.

51:41.240 --> 51:43.549
Only Fritz and I have seen die.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.555
It was terrible.
You have no idea!

52:19.560 --> 52:20.834
Hello, is that you?

52:21.680 --> 52:23.398
Of course I am alone.

52:24.160 --> 52:26.116
Why did not you all say?

52:27.440 --> 52:31.069
What do you mean there is nothing
explain? There was an unexpected.

52:32.720 --> 52:34.073
He does not let me ...

53:56.680 --> 53:58.432
Useless, is closed.

54:00.160 --> 54:01.229
What are you doing here?

54:02.040 --> 54:04.110
Tell me where thou hast led Barbara.

54:05.240 --> 54:07.708
Nowhere, I also looking for her.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.278
I was wrong the other night.

54:12.240 --> 54:14.196
You should not let her go.

54:14.920 --> 54:16.831
It has a lot to me.

54:17.040 --> 54:19.508
I have no intention
to abandon it.

54:20.240 --> 54:22.435
This man, who sent you?

54:23.200 --> 54:25.589
I do not know who you mean.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.431
Barbara is in danger with you.

54:28.720 --> 54:30.836
I stop you
do him harm.

54:31.800 --> 54:33.028
Enough!

54:36.320 --> 54:38.038
It is to her to decide.

54:38.360 --> 54:40.237
I think she has already decided.

54:40.440 --> 54:42.476
Go back to your brother.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.432
This is the only solution.

54:45.440 --> 54:46.509
Only.

55:07.520 --> 55:08.589
<i>It has its problems,</i>

55:08.880 --> 55:09.756
<i>you and yours.</i>

55:11.000 --> 55:11.750
<i>Believe me,</i>

55:12.040 --> 55:13.393
<i>do not think about it.</i>

55:18.840 --> 55:19.795
<i>I can not help you.</i>

55:22.960 --> 55:23.710
<i>You wary of it</i>

55:24.000 --> 55:25.149
<i>or you need her?</i>

56:13.720 --> 56:14.914
Barbara!

56:19.240 --> 56:20.514
Where are you?

56:25.200 --> 56:26.349
Barbara?

56:38.840 --> 56:41.593
No, it has nothing to do
in this story.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.075
Malcolm!

56:51.240 --> 56:52.798
She was in the car?

56:53.000 --> 56:54.433
What happened?

56:55.240 --> 56:56.639
Malcolm, I want ...

57:07.520 --> 57:08.635
Malcolm.

58:52.040 --> 58:55.396
Be careful, this time
it is not loaded with blanks.

58:57.840 --> 58:58.716
But, you ...

58:59.600 --> 59:00.749
Impossible!

59:01.280 --> 59:03.236
You have all complicated.

59:03.560 --> 59:04.356
Pity.

59:05.080 --> 59:06.229
What have you done to Barbara?

59:06.440 --> 59:08.112
Me, I do not kill women.

59:08.640 --> 59:11.393
I killed the old.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.709
Now, do what I say.

59:15.280 --> 59:16.759
Get in the car.

59:17.400 --> 59:18.150
Go!

59:19.120 --> 59:20.189
Come on.

59:22.600 --> 59:23.635
Put the contact.

59:24.720 --> 59:25.357
Go.

59:30.240 --> 59:30.877
Turn.

59:31.480 --> 59:32.356
Go there.

59:38.320 --> 59:39.070
Careful.

59:52.320 --> 59:53.833
Come closer to the precipice.

59:56.160 --> 59:57.036
A little more.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.833
They thought it was enough
to scare you.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:04.836
Who?

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.109
The orders have changed.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.678
You'll make a glide.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.716
Put yourself in neutral.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.356
<i>Hello?</i>

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.709
My brother called?

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.195
<i>No, I try to join?</i>

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.958
No, this is not serious.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.396
Barbara.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.909
<i>You have done everything
miss, Luca.</i>

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.794
Your plan did not work, Fritz.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.752
I had to decide alone.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.235
Ask him to her, what happened.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.273
I do not know, okay?

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.633
I agree with you.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.359
Your brother died in an accident,
that's all.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.198
And you are responsible.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.631
We just wanted to help,

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.755
<i>but it got a horrible plot.</i>

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.831
It's better like that
it simplifies things.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.356
Want a bonus?

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.356
No, after all,
I did it out of friendship.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.469
But of course.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.195
As for you, Barbara,
I beg you

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.118
no unnecessary hysteria.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.838
I thought it was a maneuver
to be hospitalized

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.109
for it can be treated.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.838
<i>I felt confident.</i>

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.951
<i>I thought we would save.</i>

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.150
Indeed.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.631
He took me to the quarry

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.956
assuring me that he was there.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.869
And he was there.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.118
But in the car, dead!

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.070
Stop!

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.079
If you had followed my instructions ...

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.273
Yes, you and that idiot Malcolm.
And then this one.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.471
Nobody followed the instructions.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.750
You need him cause shock,

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.034
but he
who made you mad.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.358
If Torres had not thought ...

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.949
By the way, where's Torres?

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.394
It should disappear
after the accident.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.794
As you wanted.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.191
He took the money,
he will not say anything, do not worry.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.276
Coward!

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.679
So, you too were in agreement.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.639
You wanted to kill him.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.513
- Leave me alone with her.
- But ...

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.117
I have one thing to say.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.109
<i>Listen to me.</i>

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.994
<i>is an accident,
useless to complain.</i>

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.311
Your friend, what name does he?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.396
Alex.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.879
He knows nothing,
leave him alone.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.592
Go with him immediately.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.553
Take that, it will serve you.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.875
I owe you.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.909
Find something
to tell your friend.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.119
I can not believe you, Fritz.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.038
You killed your brother.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.958
I had no choice.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.873
If you were in love,

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.353
thou hast had a narrow escape.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.390
How?

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.194
Christian was crazy!

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.157
<i>Fu</i>

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.632
<i>I tried to help you,
but it was in vain.</i>

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.949
<i>Not true!</i>

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:02.513
But I knew him.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.518
You can not tell me that,
tell me the truth.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:10.433
You wanted to get rid of him,
any way.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.753
To be the sole owner
Plant!

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.790
Hush!

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.275
I told you he was crazy.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:18.351
Yes.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.117
<i>Always.
My only mistake was</i>

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.310
<i>let him free,</i>

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.875
<i>not to be hospitalized.</i>

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.189
- Do you understand?
- You're crazy!

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.279
You're a fool.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.595
Now, go away.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.515
Go away.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.837
Disappear and forget
whole story.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.434
Do not make me...

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.112
I say nothing.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.279
It's useless.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.878
Now nothing can bring him back.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.712
Range them with the rest.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.310
I'm sorry

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.238
but necessary.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.673
You can recognize these objects?

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:55.278
Yes, they are his. That's him.

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:56.912
Commissioner.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.877
They were found on him.

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:16.312
<i>The accident that claimed the life
the young industrialist</i>

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.751
<i>took place near a quarry.
car...</i>

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.394
It is not him, I'm sure.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.795
It was he who killed Torres.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.274
Now he thinks
they believed death.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.595
<i>We need to intervene.</i>

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.392
<i>Leave me a little time.</i>

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.955
No, you've already made
too many mistakes.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.635
I'll handle this.

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.910
I'm on my own.

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:42.554
Franca!

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.513
Come warm yourself.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.189
Where is Nadia?

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:47.276
Nadia!

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.747
But she was there.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.274
She had to find a customer.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.239
What a rotten place.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.193
To whom you say.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.191
- Now what?
- We're leaving.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.711
- I drop you somewhere?
- Yes.

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.348
You're the head of a funeral.

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.279
What's up?
You've lost your tongue?

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.390
But no.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.795
You were very nice.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.513
Where are you going?

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.116
I do not know.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.353
- It's still early.
- I agree with you.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.995
It tells you to go for a drink
in a quiet place?

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.430
There is a motel

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.470
in the corner.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.549
A motel?

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.638
Why a Motel? Why?

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.231
It is a place like any other.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.550
Something wrong?

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.551
Stop, I come down here.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.913
I got there, thank you.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.155
You deserve to pass
night out, little slut.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.992
You scared me!

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.991
I must speak to you.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:09.476
I bothering you?

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.999
No, not at all.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.871
You're lucky to find me.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.550
I thought you were cruising
Barbara. Did she crash?

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.312
Do not talk about Barbara.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.514
I came to talk to me.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.872
I'm listening.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.390
Go!

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.872
I do not know how to explain.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.276
It happens ridiculous things.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.159
They put me
in a dangerous situation.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.237
It's a real enigma.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.192
First, this killer, then Malcolm

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.875
- Clorinda.
- Listen ...

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.511
You can calmly explain?
I do not understand.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:54.550
You can help me.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.758
You know my brother?

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.157
I met him once or twice.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.195
It is a strange guy,
it makes everyone uncomfortable.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.510
You think him capable of doing harm?

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.835
To me, for example?

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.799
I do not know, it's your brother.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.790
Yes, we grew up together.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.992
We loved each other well.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.349
I liked him.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.595
Do me, call him.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.270
It must still be in office.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.991
Yes, hello?

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.755
Hello?

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.673
Excuse me
I saw the light on.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.839
All my condolences.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.237
Thank you.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.838
I need to be alone.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.110
You can go home.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.436
- Are you sure?
- Yes, go ahead.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.756
Do not close, I expect someone.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.836
Okay.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.037
You did a good job.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.071
I had reason to admire.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:31.277
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Yes, it's me.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.030
You're surprised?

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.437
I felt that you were going back,
Christian.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.551
Perhaps because this body
was strange.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.069
It aroused in me
any emotion or feeling.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.079
I understand you, Fritz.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.511
We must solve these problems.
Our father, me ...

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.829
The problems must be solved
no?

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.514
Do not talk about our father,
Christian.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.949
Malcolm!

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:18.791
I know

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.750
you have always held
responsible for his death.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.551
You had me almost convinced.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.191
The investigation concluded suicide.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.349
Now, I can not
do anything for you.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.709
Clorinda!

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.397
I do not want explanations.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.989
I know, his death shocked thee.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.989
A death so cruel, so stupid.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.678
But trying to respond.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.033
Let me help you.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.918
If you had not been there ...

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.633
Excuse me.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.272
I do not know what to do.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.835
I can not believe
he died.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.110
- Calm down, Barbara.
- Excuse me.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.158
We have to go away.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.599
Yes, you're right.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.350
I'll pass
take our tickets at the hotel.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.790
I'll be right back.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.350
You might want to come with me?

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.869
No, he'd better not.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.358
I do not want to see anybody.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.278
Hurry, please.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.390
Okay.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.796
Christian is impossible!

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.916
You're alive!

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.314
Yes, I am alive and I love you.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.472
Let me explain.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.636
I want you to know.

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.752
- No, it is for me to explain.
- I know everything.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.154
I love you, you know.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.153
Alex will happen.

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.679
Whatever.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.712
They go together.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.512
We'll go wherever you want.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.917
Yes, both.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.230
My love ...

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.070
No, not you!

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.833
- No!
- Christian, no!

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.555
Christian, no!

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.110
Barbara!

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:57.909
Barbara!

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:39.835
Tire.

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:43.909
Kill me.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.509
<i>According to our records,
your grandfather</i>

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.709
<i>died in this hospital,
March 2, 1943.</i>

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.878
<i>This confirms that the disease

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.310
<i>is hereditary.</i>

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.310
<i>be hospitalized before it
degenerates into senseless violence,</i>

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.236
<i>September 30 at the latest.
Otherwise...</i>

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:30.677
Yes?

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.476
Yes, it's me.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.515
Near the motel? Are you sure?

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.913
I'm coming.

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.634
<i>illness of your brother Christian
is hereditary.</i>

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.990
<i>The disease is hereditary.</i>

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.072
<i>Hereditary.</i>
