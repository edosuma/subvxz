34:08.004 --> 34:09.619
Hey, Blur, it's Brian.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.497
I like to consider myself
a longtime supporter...

34:12.675 --> 34:15.508
...of these vigilantes,
as they like to call it now.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.293
All of my hopes were conﬁrmed...

34:17.472 --> 34:20.464
when I saw that mysterious letter S
showing up everywhere.

34:20.641 --> 34:24.554
I knew it was you guys. And so,
what it's worth, Blur, thank you.

34:24.771 --> 34:28.639
You've already changed my life.
Keep ﬁghting, no matter what.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.892
I remember what it was like here
in Metropolis before he came.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.983
You couldn't even walk the streets.
But since the Blur came, we have hope.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.068
So I just wanna let the Blur know...

34:38.284 --> 34:42.653
...that there are still people
who support him and l'rn one of them.

34:42.830 --> 34:46.322
Being a hero isn't about being able
to save every person from a mugging...

34:46.501 --> 34:48.913
...or pull someone
from a burning building...

34:49.087 --> 34:51.920

for a brighter tomorrow.

that heroes can and do exist.

as you're doing what you're doing...

of our hometown safe...

35:26.541 --> 35:27.906
...and they're amazing...

35:28.084 --> 35:30.541
...but that's not what inspires me
about him.

into strengths...

...in order for the Blur
to be a true beacon of hope...

37:59.318 --> 38:02.025

to see my face too.
