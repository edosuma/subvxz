01:37.349 --> 01:38.511
Oh, that was so embarrassing.

01:38.683 --> 01:40.924
Mr. Suiter must think
l'm a complete idiot.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.430
Andrea, it was just an exercise.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.761
- Yeah, we all have to do it.
- lt was so humiliating.

01:44.939 --> 01:47.476
Standing there and quacking
in front of the entire class.

01:47.650 --> 01:50.520
l mean, of all the animals,
why did he have to choose a duck?

01:50.736 --> 01:53.985
Seriously, guys, do you think it has
something to do with the way l look?

01:54.198 --> 01:56.071
Andrea, that's not the point.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.067
The question is,
when you were up there

01:58.243 --> 02:01.943
quacking and strutting
and preening your feathers,

02:02.122 --> 02:04.529
did you really feel like a duck?

02:04.749 --> 02:07.204
Brenda, of course not.
l felt like a fool.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.491
Hi, guys.

02:11.130 --> 02:13.205
- What's Kelly doing here?
- She's picking me up.

02:13.382 --> 02:15.421
We're having lunch with her mom
at the beach club.

02:15.634 --> 02:17.377
Brenda, that's doing lunch.

02:18.637 --> 02:21.507
l thought you swore you wouldn't
set foot in this hallway until fall.

02:21.681 --> 02:23.175
Oh, l know. How do you guys do it?

02:23.350 --> 02:25.887
Being here in the middle of summer
totally gives me the creeps.

02:26.061 --> 02:27.768
Are you kidding? lt's fantastic.

02:27.937 --> 02:30.344
lt's like having the entire freeway
all to yourself.

02:30.565 --> 02:32.604
- You can get used to it.
- Sort of.

02:32.775 --> 02:37.068
l couldn't. Brenda, let's get out of here
before l start having flashbacks.

03:01.719 --> 03:04.007
- Thanks for the ride, Kelly.
- You're welcome.

03:04.179 --> 03:06.385
Andrea, stay for lunch.
l'm sure my mom wouldn't mind.

03:06.557 --> 03:08.845
Yeah, you should definitely join us.

03:09.017 --> 03:12.053
Thanks, but l really need to talk
to Brandon.

03:12.229 --> 03:15.063
Maybe that's your problem.
Too much talk and not enough--

03:15.231 --> 03:16.559
This may come as a shock to you,

03:16.733 --> 03:19.223
but it is possible
just to be friends with a guy.

03:19.402 --> 03:21.560
Not if he's adorable.

03:22.155 --> 03:23.234
What?

03:31.205 --> 03:32.615
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

03:32.789 --> 03:34.117
- Hi.
- Hi, Brenda.

03:34.291 --> 03:37.327
l'm sorry, you guys.
l couldn't help myself. l was starving.

03:37.544 --> 03:39.002
That's all right. Dig in.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.458
They have the world's
best chicken salad here.

03:41.631 --> 03:44.038
But go ahead,
order whatever you want.

03:44.384 --> 03:46.127
Brenda, they have a surf burger.

03:46.344 --> 03:48.170
l wonder who they named that after.

04:00.482 --> 04:03.731
- l miss you, Bren.
- l really miss you.

04:19.958 --> 04:21.617
Brenda.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.168
Brenda?

04:23.920 --> 04:24.999
Are you okay?

04:26.047 --> 04:27.291
Yeah.

04:27.465 --> 04:30.833
l'm sorry, the sun's just--
lt's making me a little spacey.

04:37.975 --> 04:40.596
Here you go, ladies.

04:42.021 --> 04:44.511
Walsh, your sister's over there.
Table 3.

04:44.815 --> 04:47.103
- Oh, cool.
- And a friend's here to see you.

04:47.276 --> 04:49.766
What is this? Visitors' day?

04:50.612 --> 04:52.236
- Thanks, Henry.
- Sure enough.

04:52.405 --> 04:53.436
What are you doing here?

04:53.615 --> 04:55.737
Look, l wouldn't bother you
unless it was important.

04:55.909 --> 04:58.482
l know. You should have
brought your suit, you could swim.

04:58.661 --> 05:00.819
No, that's okay.
l don't have time to stay.

05:00.997 --> 05:02.491
Listen, there's this really great kid

05:02.665 --> 05:04.657
at the Valley Youth Center
where l'm a volunteer.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.411
Ten years old,
lives alone with his mom.

05:06.585 --> 05:08.127
l don't know what happened
to his dad--

05:08.295 --> 05:10.121
Why do l have the feeling
you're about to call

05:10.297 --> 05:11.874
on my sense of civic responsibility

05:12.049 --> 05:14.421
for one of your
save-the-universe projects?

05:14.593 --> 05:16.715
Just hear me out, okay?

05:17.387 --> 05:18.631
Listening.

05:18.805 --> 05:21.971
He had this volunteer Big Brother
but the guy can't do it anymore.

05:22.141 --> 05:24.299
lt may take months
till the programme can go and--

05:24.477 --> 05:26.019
Andrea, l don't have the time.

05:26.187 --> 05:28.512
l'm not asking you to go through
the Big Brother training.

05:28.689 --> 05:31.689
All l'm asking you, on a very
informal basis, is to hang out with--

05:31.859 --> 05:34.978
And where would l find the time
for this little informal get-together?

05:35.195 --> 05:36.689
Come on. One afternoon a week?

05:36.863 --> 05:39.151
We're not talking
long-term commitment here.

05:39.324 --> 05:43.736
The kid needs a friend, you know,
an older guy that he can look up to.

05:43.953 --> 05:46.194
- Can l think about it?
- Yeah, go ahead. Think.

05:46.372 --> 05:48.827
l don't have to be anywhere
for 20 minutes.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.781
- l told Felix all about you.
- Felix?

05:51.961 --> 05:53.371
Yes, and he can't wait to meet you.

05:53.546 --> 05:55.123
You should see him
on a pair of skates.

05:55.297 --> 05:57.503
He could teach you a thing or two.

05:58.509 --> 05:59.789
Oh, you think so?

05:59.968 --> 06:02.043
Well, you'll never know
until you meet him.

06:03.722 --> 06:06.888
Here's his address.
He lives in Reseda.

06:08.601 --> 06:09.929
Well, l do have tomorrow off.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.305
Yeah, l know. l already checked
your schedule with Henry.

06:15.191 --> 06:18.310
- You knew l'd fold, didn't you?
- l played a hunch.

06:18.486 --> 06:21.107
l'll tell him you're coming by,
say, 1 0 a.m.?

06:22.156 --> 06:23.733
- Fine.
- Good.

06:25.117 --> 06:26.741
- Go.
- Gone.

06:26.910 --> 06:28.072
- Go.
- Gone!

06:28.286 --> 06:29.780
What is that all about?

06:29.955 --> 06:32.908
- High school intrigue.
- Always the best kind.

06:33.082 --> 06:34.457
Listen, somebody has got to order

06:34.626 --> 06:36.452
the grilled-chicken,
red chilli-pepper pasta

06:36.627 --> 06:38.418
with goat cheese
so l can have a bite.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.338
- God.
- What?

06:41.507 --> 06:43.001
l think l broke a tooth.

06:43.175 --> 06:45.463
Well, and how are the ladies
who lunch?

06:45.636 --> 06:47.295
- Terrible.
- Why? What's wrong?

06:47.471 --> 06:49.510
l just broke a cap
on a chicken bone.

06:49.681 --> 06:51.424
- Excuse me for a second. Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.888
- Let me see that.
- Why?

06:55.228 --> 06:58.679
l'm the third best oral surgeon
in Los Angeles.

06:59.232 --> 07:00.394
Who are the first two?

07:01.067 --> 07:03.557
- Are you a celebrity?
- No.

07:03.778 --> 07:05.188
Then, it doesn't matter, does it?

07:06.530 --> 07:08.771
- Open up.
- ls it bad?

07:10.492 --> 07:12.235
- Get me some Krazy Glue.
- Yeah, sure.

07:12.411 --> 07:15.162
Krazy Glue?
Are you really a dentist?

07:15.330 --> 07:17.156
Absolutely.

07:18.291 --> 07:19.619
Are you really single?

07:20.418 --> 07:22.244
Painfully.

07:22.921 --> 07:26.965
There's no charge for the procedure
if you let me take you out to dinner.

07:28.092 --> 07:29.883
Open again.

07:30.261 --> 07:32.300
Do you believe this guy?

07:32.471 --> 07:35.804
- ls that really ethical?
- Not really.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.425
Feel free to say no.
l'll still glue the tooth.

07:38.644 --> 07:40.802
- Say no.
- l'd love to.

07:41.021 --> 07:42.431
Good.

07:42.606 --> 07:45.275
l couldn't find any Krazy Glue
but l got this rubber cement.

07:45.483 --> 07:48.152
- lt's not--
- No, l was just kidding about the glue.

07:48.319 --> 07:50.644
l'm afraid you will have to come
and see me in the office.

07:50.863 --> 07:52.487
So, what is your name anyway?

07:52.657 --> 07:55.657
Mel. Mel Silver.

07:55.826 --> 07:58.151
l think that my son goes to school
with your daughter.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.907
- Wonderful, what's his name?
- David.

08:01.123 --> 08:02.154
Do you know David Silver?

08:09.923 --> 08:11.167
No.

08:11.341 --> 08:14.258
Yeah, kind of, but not really.

08:14.427 --> 08:17.344
Oh, l knew it.
All the pretty girls know David.

08:17.513 --> 08:20.928
l wish l had his luck with women.
He's such a ladies' man.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.510
Ever since he was in the 6th grade,

08:22.685 --> 08:25.175
when he started dating
this 7th-grade cheerleader.

08:29.649 --> 08:31.688
Can you believe
what happened at lunch yesterday?

08:31.902 --> 08:34.274
lt's like straight out
of a David Lynch movie or something.

08:34.446 --> 08:36.485
My mother is going out
with David Silver's father.

08:36.698 --> 08:39.947
- Kelly, it's not the end of the world.
- You promise you won't tell anyone?

08:40.118 --> 08:42.988
No, l promise l won't say a word
to anybody, okay?

08:43.162 --> 08:44.988
Goodbye.

08:47.625 --> 08:50.744
Kelly's mom broke a tooth
at the beach club yesterday.

08:53.463 --> 08:55.751
Forget it, you'll never understand.

08:59.636 --> 09:01.462
Brandon,
l thought today was your day off.

09:01.638 --> 09:03.345
Yeah, it is, but l promised Andrea

09:03.514 --> 09:05.173
l'd play big brother
to this kid she knows

09:05.349 --> 09:07.922
- from the Valley Youth Center.
- That's great.

09:08.144 --> 09:10.017
Yeah, but don't spread yourself
too thin, son.

09:10.229 --> 09:11.557
Hey, don't worry about it, Dad.

09:11.730 --> 09:14.683
l mean, l always wanted
a little brother anyway, right?

09:32.124 --> 09:33.950
- Hi, you must be Brandon.
- Hi, yeah.

09:34.126 --> 09:35.785
- l'm Suzanne, Felix's mom.
- Hi, Suzanne.

09:35.961 --> 09:38.630
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

09:39.214 --> 09:41.336
Brandon's here.

09:42.301 --> 09:45.087
- Nice apartment.
- Oh, it's all right.

09:45.262 --> 09:47.219
lt's not Beverly Hills.

09:47.389 --> 09:51.386
Believe it or not, l went
to Beverly Hills High too. Class of...

09:52.143 --> 09:55.558
- Never mind.
- Actually, l go to West Beverly.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.437
Listen, thanks for doing this,
Brandon.

10:00.651 --> 10:04.233
You have no idea how much
this means to Felix and to me.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.948
Felix!

10:10.869 --> 10:13.620
So, what happened to Felix's dad?

10:13.788 --> 10:15.282
That's what l'd like to know.

10:15.832 --> 10:20.125
Honestly, he remarried
and moved to Phoenix.

10:20.294 --> 10:22.619
And l haven't heard from him
for three years.

10:22.797 --> 10:24.339
Sends Felix 1 0 bucks
every Christmas.

10:24.507 --> 10:28.967
That's how l know he's still in Phoenix,
because of the postmark.

10:29.511 --> 10:32.428
- Hey, Felix, how's it going?
- lt sucks.

10:32.597 --> 10:34.885
Well, then, it can only get better
from there, can't it?

10:35.058 --> 10:36.089
We'll see.

10:36.267 --> 10:38.674
Felix, is that any way to say hello
to Brandon?

10:38.853 --> 10:42.268
- Sorry.
- You behave yourself.

10:42.607 --> 10:44.599
Give your mom a kiss.

10:48.154 --> 10:51.320
Brandon, he's a good kid.
He really is. lt's--

10:51.865 --> 10:56.194
But he can be a bit difficult at times.

10:56.370 --> 10:59.039
Too difficult, l guess,
for his last Big Brother.

10:59.206 --> 11:01.531
Well,
he doesn't look so scary to me.

11:09.215 --> 11:11.836
Felix, be careful.

11:16.138 --> 11:17.596
Hey!

11:18.891 --> 11:20.053
Hey, Felix.

11:20.225 --> 11:22.431
Try to stay with me, huh, man?
l don't wanna lose you.

11:22.602 --> 11:25.175
You know, you don't have to do this.
l got friends, you know.

11:25.355 --> 11:27.430
Yeah, l'm sure you do.

11:27.607 --> 11:30.097
l thought you wanted someone
a little older to hang out with.

11:30.276 --> 11:33.976
- l'm not a charity case.
- Well, that's good to know.

11:34.864 --> 11:36.939
So why are you doing this?

11:37.116 --> 11:38.859
l mean, don't you have
anything better to do

11:39.034 --> 11:41.441
than hang out with some stupid kid?

11:41.620 --> 11:43.612
l guess not.

11:43.872 --> 11:45.531
Okay,

11:45.707 --> 11:47.865
but you gotta keep up.

11:55.133 --> 11:56.675
Working on those tan lines, ladies?

11:59.136 --> 12:02.836
- So, Kel, l hear tonight's the big night.
- What are you talking about?

12:03.057 --> 12:05.345
Well, your mom, David Silver's dad.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.723
Think he'll bag her on the first date?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.017
Steve, you are such a swine.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.974
Why don't you go take a hike
in the ocean and drown yourself?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.940
Touchy. Touchy.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.439
What's the big deal?

12:17.612 --> 12:20.612
l mean, just because David's a geek,
doesn't mean his dad is.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.564
Donna, the avocado doesn't fall far
from the tree.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.527
No, you know, David's not that bad.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.742
l kind of got to know him
when we did our scene.

12:28.372 --> 12:31.123
l don't know, he's always looking at me
like l'm naked or something.

12:31.291 --> 12:33.034
And now, he's fully bragging
about this date

12:33.210 --> 12:35.368
like it's the two of us going out.

12:36.296 --> 12:38.288
l've got to do something.

12:38.465 --> 12:40.504
What if my mom
really likes this guy?

12:48.015 --> 12:49.592
- You can let go now.
- l don't know.

12:49.767 --> 12:51.309
You think you can stay out of trouble?

12:51.477 --> 12:52.556
l guess.

12:52.728 --> 12:56.227
Hey, Stan, could you get a couple of
lemonades here for me and my friend?

12:56.398 --> 12:57.477
Lots of ice?

12:57.649 --> 13:00.270
Don't go anywhere. l'll be right back.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.701
Hello, you've reached
the Zuckerman residence.

13:17.876 --> 13:18.907
At the sound of the tone,

13:19.086 --> 13:20.793
leave your name, number
and the time

13:20.963 --> 13:23.370
and the appropriate Zuckerman
will get back to you promptly.

13:23.548 --> 13:24.876
Thank you.

13:25.050 --> 13:27.256
Andrea, thanks a lot.

13:27.427 --> 13:29.466
l think the only reason
you dumped Felix on me

13:29.637 --> 13:31.131
was to get him off your back.

13:31.306 --> 13:34.674
l'm telling you,
this kid is a royal pain in the--

13:35.393 --> 13:36.803
Thought you wanted your lemonade.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.393
lt's pretty hot.

13:40.898 --> 13:42.689
Thanks.

13:42.858 --> 13:44.649
Sorry for being
such a pain in the butt.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.519
Yeah, what's with that anyway?

13:46.695 --> 13:48.901
ls that your way of testing people
or something?

13:49.072 --> 13:51.562
- l don't know.
- Look, l'm not a babysitter, all right?

13:51.741 --> 13:54.860
l'm with you because l thought you
wanted someone older to hang with.

13:58.539 --> 13:59.997
What is this place anyway?

14:01.417 --> 14:03.623
lt's the Beverly Hills Beach Club.

14:03.919 --> 14:06.409
- lt's where l work.
- lt's pretty cool.

14:06.589 --> 14:09.423
Yeah, well, l figured as long as l had
to work over my vacation,

14:09.591 --> 14:13.255
l might as well look at pretty girls
and get a tan while l was at it.

14:14.221 --> 14:18.348
So was l so much of a pain in the butt
that you never wanna see me again?

14:19.684 --> 14:21.925
l'd consider hanging out
with you again.

14:22.103 --> 14:24.724
Hey, maybe l can come
and see you work sometime.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.601
- Maybe.
- l wouldn't get in the way. l swear.

14:29.151 --> 14:31.190
All right, man, we'll see.

14:37.534 --> 14:40.155
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi.

14:42.539 --> 14:44.412
So did you have a good day
at the beach?

14:44.582 --> 14:46.373
Groovy.

14:48.127 --> 14:50.748
l hear you and David
hang out together.

14:51.172 --> 14:55.750
No. l mean, l know who he is
but l don't really know him.

14:55.968 --> 14:57.877
Well, l've gotta tell you, Kelly.

14:58.053 --> 14:59.712
You've got a real fan in my son.

15:00.305 --> 15:04.717
And when David likes somebody,
l mean, really likes somebody,

15:04.893 --> 15:06.885
you can be sure of one thing.

15:07.437 --> 15:10.058
- What?
- You've got a friend for life.

15:11.441 --> 15:13.350
How lucky for me.

15:13.526 --> 15:15.684
- Hi, Mel.
- Hi, Jackie.

15:16.112 --> 15:18.946
- You look great.
- Thanks. So do you.

15:19.573 --> 15:23.617
Oh, Mel. White tulips?

15:23.785 --> 15:27.652
- Gorgeous. You didn't have to do that.
- Okay.

15:29.708 --> 15:33.325
Honey, would you mind putting them
in some water? Thanks.

15:33.503 --> 15:35.294
- You hungry?
- Famished.

15:35.505 --> 15:38.873
l made reservations at Michael's
in Santa Monica. l hope that's okay.

15:39.050 --> 15:41.457
- lt's only my favourite restaurant.
- Good. Good.

15:41.635 --> 15:43.259
Let's go. Good night, Kelly.

15:43.429 --> 15:45.088
l'll be sure to say hi to David for you.

15:45.264 --> 15:48.217
Good night, sweetheart.
Don't wait up.

16:02.071 --> 16:03.730
Ladies, how about
these chairs right here?

16:03.906 --> 16:06.740
Maximise your tanning potential.

16:07.952 --> 16:10.786
- Would you like a towel?
- Towel? Sure.

16:10.954 --> 16:12.448
- Some ice water, maybe?
- Love some.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.615
- l'll get it.
- Felix, wait.

16:14.791 --> 16:17.993
- Oh, he's quite a little helper.
- Yeah.

16:18.169 --> 16:20.742
Ladies. Walsh,
could l talk to you for a minute?

16:20.922 --> 16:22.036
Yeah, sure.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.290
- Excuse us.
- Excuse me.

16:27.428 --> 16:28.590
What's with the kid?

16:28.763 --> 16:31.680
Oh, he's just some little guy
l'm playing Big Brother to.

16:32.183 --> 16:33.214
That's commendable.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.965
Just make sure he doesn't
get in the way of your doing your job.

16:36.145 --> 16:37.852
Oh, l'm not.
He's actually helping me out.

16:38.188 --> 16:39.219
Oh, yeah?

16:39.398 --> 16:41.935
Well, l just saw him helping himself
to some french fries

16:42.108 --> 16:44.729
on that tray over there.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.398
l'm sorry. l'll keep
a better eye on him. l promise.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.569
lce water.

16:55.704 --> 16:56.735
lce water.

16:57.414 --> 16:59.205
lce water.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.493
Yeah.

17:03.503 --> 17:07.037
So the word is that Kelly's mom
and David's dad totally hit it off.

17:07.214 --> 17:09.124
That's wonderful, Brenda.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.384
Kelly must be thrilled her mother's
finally met somebody nice.

17:12.554 --> 17:15.175
Thrilled?
She's completely freaking out.

17:16.766 --> 17:19.435
Well, she'll get over it.

17:19.602 --> 17:21.012
Why do you say that?

17:21.436 --> 17:23.512
Well, because when you meet
somebody you care about,

17:23.689 --> 17:26.393
things just have a way
of working themselves out.

17:27.108 --> 17:30.773
Mom, you are such a romantic.

17:30.946 --> 17:33.567
Be careful. lt runs in the family.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.397
So, Brenda, what do you think?

17:37.368 --> 17:39.325
Are things gonna work out
between us?

17:47.503 --> 17:50.337
Hey, Mom, Brenda, l want you to meet
a friend of mine. This is Felix.

17:50.506 --> 17:52.712
- Hi, Felix. Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

17:52.883 --> 17:54.460
He was helping me out
at the club today.

17:54.634 --> 17:58.085
l thought maybe, if it was all right
with his mom, he could stay for dinner.

17:58.263 --> 17:59.342
Sounds good to me.

17:59.514 --> 18:03.131
Listen, Felix, l was just about to start
the famous Walsh french fries.

18:03.309 --> 18:04.933
- You wanna help?
- Yeah.

18:05.102 --> 18:07.011
- Boy, this house sure is great.
- Thanks.

18:07.188 --> 18:10.058
Listen, l'm gonna put this on you.
This oil's awfully hot.

18:10.232 --> 18:12.307
This'll keep it from getting
your clothes messed up.

18:12.526 --> 18:13.770
Oh, don't worry about them.

18:13.944 --> 18:15.438
There you go, Felix,

18:15.654 --> 18:17.693
but be careful,
these are Brenda's favourite food.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.607
After chocolate.

18:19.783 --> 18:21.325
Okay, that oil looks ready.

18:21.493 --> 18:22.987
All right, go ahead. Dump them in.

18:25.413 --> 18:27.738
l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm really sorry.

18:27.915 --> 18:28.946
Felix, it's all right.

18:29.167 --> 18:31.740
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

18:31.961 --> 18:34.119
Just clumsy, l guess.

18:35.673 --> 18:37.499
Felix, why don't you go
call your mother

18:37.675 --> 18:40.000
and let her know you're here?
l don't want her to worry.

18:40.177 --> 18:41.587
Okay.

18:45.599 --> 18:47.141
Sorry about that.

18:47.309 --> 18:49.348
Hey, don't worry about it,
we'll make more.

19:00.029 --> 19:01.772
Hi, Mom.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.732
Everything's great.

19:05.867 --> 19:08.357
l helped Brandon out
at the beach club today.

19:08.537 --> 19:10.280
Now they want me
to stay for dinner.

19:10.455 --> 19:12.780
l'm at their house. ls that okay?

19:14.626 --> 19:16.285
Okay.

19:17.128 --> 19:18.787
Bye, Mom.

19:19.589 --> 19:21.498
l love you too.

19:28.555 --> 19:30.843
- Hey, Kel.
- Hi.

19:31.641 --> 19:35.140
l heard your mom and my dad
had a pretty swinging time last night.

19:35.312 --> 19:36.806
That's not what l heard.

19:37.564 --> 19:38.726
No, seriously.

19:38.898 --> 19:41.104
l think they already set up another date
for this week.

19:42.151 --> 19:45.235
Look, David. My mother's personal life
is her own business.

19:45.404 --> 19:47.313
l don't pay much attention to it.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.656
Wouldn't it be cool if we ended up
stepbrother and stepsister?

19:55.706 --> 19:57.164
Stepbrother and stepsister.

19:57.332 --> 19:58.790
Stepbrother and stepsister.

19:58.959 --> 20:00.536
Stepbrother and stepsister.

20:00.710 --> 20:03.247
Stepbrother and stepsister.

20:03.713 --> 20:05.420
Oh, man, l wonder
how much these will bring

20:05.590 --> 20:07.665
at the annual West Beverly auction?

20:07.842 --> 20:10.878
Not as much
as a picture of Kelly wearing it.

20:11.095 --> 20:14.131
Oh, my God. What are you guys--?
Give me that.

20:14.306 --> 20:17.721
Get out of my room.
Get out of my room now!

20:17.893 --> 20:19.387
She's even cuter mad.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.602
l've gotta do something.

20:32.198 --> 20:35.946
Mel, thanks for another
wonderful evening.

20:36.118 --> 20:38.406
l had a great time too.

20:46.002 --> 20:50.129
l hope this isn't too forward,
but how about tomorrow night?

20:50.340 --> 20:52.795
l'm sorry,
l already have plans with my daughter.

20:52.967 --> 20:55.540
We're trying to spend a lot
of quality time together these days.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.637
Well, so bring her. l'll bring David.
We'll make it a foursome.

20:58.806 --> 20:59.968
We'll go someplace nice.

21:00.141 --> 21:02.014
- That sounds great.
- Good.

21:02.893 --> 21:05.562
Are you sure
there's nothing weird about you?

21:05.771 --> 21:09.388
- Something that you're hiding?
- No, why?

21:09.858 --> 21:12.811
l'm used to men
with major liabilities.

21:12.986 --> 21:15.311
You just seem too good to be true.

21:15.947 --> 21:17.654
Well, give it time.

21:17.824 --> 21:20.528
Under the surface,
l'm an egomaniacal monster.

21:20.701 --> 21:23.785
But by the time you find out the truth,
it'll be too late.

21:23.955 --> 21:26.872
- You'll be in my clutches.
- How frightening.

21:28.250 --> 21:32.377
- Mom, is that you?
- Yeah, hi, Kelly. l'll be up in a minute.

21:34.006 --> 21:36.045
l'll pick you up at 7.

21:36.842 --> 21:39.961
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:43.181 --> 21:46.383
- How'd it go?
- Two for two.

21:48.519 --> 21:51.353
Mom, l thought they told you
you should stay single for a while

21:51.522 --> 21:52.932
to adjust to being sober.

21:53.107 --> 21:54.304
Kelly, please.

21:54.483 --> 21:56.392
You can't be both my therapist
and my daughter.

21:56.568 --> 21:57.599
Which is it gonna be?

21:57.778 --> 21:59.687
l know, but he does not
seem like your type.

22:00.322 --> 22:03.156
Well, you can get
to know him better tomorrow.

22:03.533 --> 22:06.818
Tomorrow? l thought you and l
were having dinner together tomorrow.

22:07.036 --> 22:09.111
l know, but l thought
we'd make it a happy foursome.

22:09.288 --> 22:11.529
You, me, Mel and David.
Doesn't that sound fun?

22:11.707 --> 22:13.746
No, that sounds totally excruciating.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.501
Well, at least we're being honest.

22:16.212 --> 22:18.453
Good night, sweetie. l'm beat.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.289
What if l can't make it?

22:20.466 --> 22:23.917
Kelly, you're going to make it.

22:32.560 --> 22:33.970
Can l have a Coke, please?

22:34.145 --> 22:36.220
- Name?
- Walsh.

22:36.397 --> 22:37.725
Felix Walsh.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.273
Felix Walsh?

22:39.442 --> 22:41.849
Yeah, l'm Brandon's little brother.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.156
Walsh.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.482
- Yeah?
- We gotta talk.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.066
- What's the matter?
- This kid.

22:52.245 --> 22:55.660
l mean, a day or two is one thing,
but this can't become a habit.

22:55.832 --> 22:56.863
Henry, l just got to work.

22:57.041 --> 22:59.199
l didn't even know he was here.
l'll take care of it.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.749
Good. l don't wanna hear
any complaints from the members.

23:01.921 --> 23:05.918
- Right.
- And Walsh,

23:06.967 --> 23:10.003
he's going around telling everybody
he's your little brother.

23:11.888 --> 23:13.963
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

23:18.770 --> 23:20.845
- Felix, my man.
- Hey, big bro.

23:21.022 --> 23:23.061
- How'd you get down here today?
- l took the bus.

23:23.232 --> 23:26.481
l wanted to surprise you.
l thought l could help you out again.

23:26.652 --> 23:29.937
l'd really like that,
but l gotta work alone. l'm sorry.

23:30.114 --> 23:31.394
Oh, well. lt's all right.

23:31.573 --> 23:34.110
Then l'll sit in the back lockers
and fold towels or something.

23:34.284 --> 23:36.988
- Nobody will see.
- l wish you could, buddy.

23:37.287 --> 23:38.318
Tomorrow's my day off.

23:38.497 --> 23:40.156
Why don't you come here
tomorrow around 9

23:40.332 --> 23:42.039
and we'll take a skate
down to Venice, huh?

23:42.250 --> 23:44.325
Well, l could go over there
by the volleyball courts

23:44.502 --> 23:47.668
- and just sit. l won't bother anybody.
- Felix, l can't.

23:47.839 --> 23:50.709
lt's a private club. l can only bring
guests down on my day off.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.457
Come on, l'll walk you out.

23:53.636 --> 23:55.628
Hey, don't look so down.
l'll see you tomorrow.

23:55.804 --> 23:58.757
- You promise?
- Promise.

24:03.812 --> 24:07.097
Hey, Kel, how about a few words
of summer wisdom for posterity?

24:08.358 --> 24:10.350
Get lost.

24:12.195 --> 24:14.021
Hey, Steve, how about you?

24:14.197 --> 24:16.023
What can l say?
lt's great to be young.

24:16.198 --> 24:21.274
l wish they all could be California girls.
You know what l'm saying?

24:22.913 --> 24:25.238
Yeah, definitely.

24:26.541 --> 24:29.992
- See you tonight, Kel.
- l'm counting the minutes.

24:30.879 --> 24:32.503
Me too.

24:37.260 --> 24:39.585
So to what do we owe
your sunny disposition?

24:42.515 --> 24:43.795
How can you stand him?

24:43.974 --> 24:47.307
David Silver? Humour him.
What's the big deal?

24:51.314 --> 24:53.271
lt's true about your mom
and his dad, huh?

24:54.234 --> 24:56.559
We're all going to dinner tonight.
Just the four of us.

24:56.736 --> 24:58.609
Won't that be cosy?

24:58.780 --> 25:01.566
They want you to get along already?
That's quick.

25:02.533 --> 25:04.110
What do you mean?

25:04.285 --> 25:07.487
Kelly, single parents never want
the two sides to get together

25:07.663 --> 25:09.370
unless it's serious.

25:09.540 --> 25:10.654
You really think so?

25:11.166 --> 25:13.123
l mean, they haven't slept together
or anything.

25:13.335 --> 25:16.419
Kelly, get with it.
Sex is out of the loop these days.

25:16.588 --> 25:20.667
lt all depends on how they get along
personally and financially.

25:21.176 --> 25:24.295
My mom was saying
how much they had in common.

25:25.054 --> 25:26.761
And he is rich.

25:26.931 --> 25:29.172
Well, then this dinner
can only mean one thing:

25:29.392 --> 25:33.970
A romantic declaration of love
in front of the kids.

25:37.608 --> 25:39.814
l think l'm gonna be sick.

25:40.068 --> 25:41.692
Steve,
what can l do to stop this thing?

25:43.780 --> 25:46.816
There is one thing that will totally
scare off a prospective stepparent.

25:46.991 --> 25:50.193
But it takes guts,
though l'm sure you've got that.

25:50.369 --> 25:51.483
What is it?

25:52.538 --> 25:54.863
You've gotta let David's father know
right from the start

25:55.041 --> 25:57.247
that life with you
won't be worth living.

25:57.918 --> 26:01.500
You've gotta be
the stepchild from hell.

26:11.139 --> 26:13.843
You're gonna love this place.
lt's one of my favourite restaurants.

26:14.017 --> 26:15.475
lt's gorgeous.

26:15.643 --> 26:18.394
Mom, isn't this the place
that gave Laurie food poisoning?

26:18.562 --> 26:20.305
l don't think so.

26:20.481 --> 26:22.722
So, Kelly,
you ever dream this would happen?

26:22.900 --> 26:26.897
Not in my wildest
Freddy Kreuger nightmares.

26:27.070 --> 26:31.233
Well, Kelly, l hope we're not dragging
you away from your friends tonight,

26:31.408 --> 26:34.657
but Jackie and l thought that
having dinner together would be fun.

26:34.828 --> 26:35.990
Why?

26:36.162 --> 26:39.079
So that l could get to know David
and so that you could get to know Mel.

26:39.290 --> 26:41.911
Let me tell you something
about Kelly, Mel.

26:42.084 --> 26:44.753
- To know her is not to love her.
- Kelly.

26:45.296 --> 26:46.790
Well, that's not what l hear.

26:46.964 --> 26:49.252
Or rather see on video.

26:49.633 --> 26:51.091
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

26:51.260 --> 26:53.003
l hardly think that that's possible.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.424
David, your father tells me

26:54.638 --> 26:57.045
that you're
West Beverly's video historian.

26:57.557 --> 26:59.715
Yeah, something like that.

26:59.893 --> 27:01.850
l can hardly turn around anymore

27:02.020 --> 27:05.269
without that obnoxious video lens
being stuck right in my face.

27:05.481 --> 27:07.806
- lt's nothing personal.
- lt's just a little perverted.

27:07.984 --> 27:09.264
What do you call those guys?

27:09.443 --> 27:11.768
- Voyeurs or something?
- Kelly.

27:12.112 --> 27:15.112
David, l forbid you to commit
one more inch of videotape

27:15.282 --> 27:17.155
to that gorgeous face.

27:17.326 --> 27:18.357
Thank you.

27:18.577 --> 27:21.696
l thought l was gonna have to get
one of those restraining orders.

27:23.832 --> 27:25.705
Let's order.

27:26.167 --> 27:29.749
Actually, l've lost my appetite.

27:30.213 --> 27:31.956
You'll be missing out, Kelly, really.

27:32.131 --> 27:34.206
This restaurant
has one of the best chefs in town.

27:34.383 --> 27:37.502
l knew there must have been some
reason why you dragged us here.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.926
Kelly, that's enough.

27:42.766 --> 27:45.007
- How about a drink to start?
- A drink?

27:45.185 --> 27:46.844
You want my mother
to order a drink?

27:47.020 --> 27:48.217
- l'll have water.
- Whatever.

27:48.396 --> 27:50.851
Because the last thing you do
is ask a recovering alcoholic

27:51.024 --> 27:52.648
- what she wants to drink--
- Kelly!

27:54.318 --> 27:56.524
Why don't you just shut up?

28:00.449 --> 28:02.571
l think we need a little trip
to the ladies' room.

28:02.743 --> 28:04.569
- Forget it. l'm out of here.
- Wait a minute.

28:04.745 --> 28:07.070
Don't you leave this restaurant,
do you hear me?

28:09.082 --> 28:10.492
What is going on?

28:10.667 --> 28:12.624
- Let go of me.
- l will not.

28:12.794 --> 28:14.869
l demand an explanation.

28:15.046 --> 28:18.212
l have never seen a ruder display
of bad manners in my entire life.

28:18.883 --> 28:21.552
Now, what were you hoping
to accomplish by that act?

28:21.719 --> 28:23.711
Aside from humiliating
and embarrassing yourself,

28:23.888 --> 28:26.461
which you did extremely well,
l might add.

28:26.890 --> 28:29.594
lf he's so great, why don't you
just go ahead and marry him?

28:29.810 --> 28:32.894
Oh, Kelly, don't be ridiculous.
We just met.

28:33.063 --> 28:35.269
He's a very sweet man
but l'm not gonna marry him.

28:35.815 --> 28:39.479
We're just dating.
Now what is the big deal?

28:42.780 --> 28:44.439
You know what?

28:44.615 --> 28:48.742
Ever since you and Dad got divorced,
almost my entire life,

28:48.911 --> 28:51.069
you have either been married
or drunk.

28:52.206 --> 28:54.743
l just thought that when you finally
got out of Timber Hills,

28:54.917 --> 28:57.075
you would wanna spend some time
getting to know me.

28:58.336 --> 28:59.913
What do you think l'm doing?

29:00.088 --> 29:01.368
Why do you think you're here?

29:02.132 --> 29:04.836
This is not about me.
This is about you and some guy.

29:05.009 --> 29:09.551
Kelly, please, cut me a little slack.

29:09.722 --> 29:11.679
Don't l have a right to be happy?

29:12.224 --> 29:15.806
Don't l have a right to have you
all to myself

29:15.978 --> 29:17.388
just for a little while?

29:17.563 --> 29:22.224
We're gonna spend lots of time
together. l promise.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.558
No matter who l'm seeing.

29:24.778 --> 29:27.529
l just don't wanna share you.

29:28.698 --> 29:30.275
Not yet.

29:30.450 --> 29:32.822
Not with David Silver.

29:33.077 --> 29:34.986
Kelly.

29:37.748 --> 29:39.621
l know.

29:40.209 --> 29:42.616
l understand.

29:44.796 --> 29:47.333
Do you think we can go back now?

29:49.801 --> 29:51.129
l don't know.

29:51.302 --> 29:54.088
l made a pretty big
fool of myself in there.

29:54.305 --> 29:55.929
Who cares?

29:56.474 --> 29:58.680
Come on.

30:06.525 --> 30:10.024
Walsh, what are you doing here?
l thought this was your day off.

30:10.237 --> 30:13.107
Yeah, it is.
Have you seen Felix around?

30:13.281 --> 30:16.032
No, l'm happy to say l have not.

30:16.201 --> 30:18.027
l was supposed to meet him here
this morning.

30:18.202 --> 30:22.069
- Kept me waiting for over an hour.
- Don't you have better things to do

30:22.248 --> 30:25.533
than to be stood up by a little squirt
on your day off?

30:27.169 --> 30:30.003
Yeah, l do.

30:52.443 --> 30:54.565
Hey, Felix.

30:58.115 --> 31:00.072
Oh, hi.

31:00.283 --> 31:01.658
What's with you, man?

31:01.826 --> 31:03.569
l wait for you all day
at the beach club.

31:03.745 --> 31:05.404
- You don't show, you don't call.
- Sorry.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.738
No wonder so many guys
don't stick it out with you.

31:08.624 --> 31:10.663
Today was my day off, Felix.

31:10.877 --> 31:14.162
l mean, if we're gonna make this work,
you gotta at least show me the--

31:15.714 --> 31:17.042
My God, what happened to you?

31:17.258 --> 31:19.001
l tried to do a triple and l wiped out.

31:19.218 --> 31:21.044
Oh, come on, man.
That's no wipe-out bruise.

31:23.513 --> 31:25.137
What happened?
Did you get into a fight?

31:27.642 --> 31:29.349
Hey, Felix.

31:30.645 --> 31:33.515
l'm here for you, man.
You can trust me.

31:35.858 --> 31:36.889
What happened?

31:38.152 --> 31:39.183
My mom hit me.

31:42.323 --> 31:44.114
- What?
- She didn't mean it.

31:44.741 --> 31:46.698
l was really bad.

31:46.910 --> 31:49.910
You couldn't have done
something so bad to deserve that.

31:50.789 --> 31:54.371
l told her l would call.
l should've called and l forgot.

31:56.002 --> 31:58.457
ls that the only one?

32:11.892 --> 32:14.217
- Felix, has this happened before?
- No.

32:15.103 --> 32:17.060
l told you she didn't mean it.

32:17.689 --> 32:18.720
She didn't mean it.

32:24.529 --> 32:26.817
Promise you won't tell?

32:31.160 --> 32:33.532
lt's gonna be okay, Felix.

32:35.747 --> 32:40.076
That's about all l can promise you.
lt's gonna be okay.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.473
Andrea.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.516
Brandon,
to what do l owe this honour?

33:03.815 --> 33:05.392
There's a really big problem
with Felix.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.310
l know. l know. l got your message.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.892
l know he can be difficult.
l didn't wanna say anything,

33:10.071 --> 33:12.608
l thought it would prejudice you.
l think he's a great kid--

33:12.782 --> 33:14.192
No, no, it's not that, Andrea.

33:14.367 --> 33:17.782
l mean, Felix is a great kid,
once you get past his walls anyways.

33:17.953 --> 33:18.984
Well, then, what is it?

33:22.082 --> 33:25.248
Have you ever noticed all the bruises
Felix gets from skating?

33:25.419 --> 33:28.787
Or how he never takes his shirt off,
even on the hottest day?

33:28.964 --> 33:30.623
Brandon,
what are you talking about?

33:31.883 --> 33:33.258
Felix's mother beats him.

33:38.431 --> 33:40.174
Brandon,
that's a really serious accusation.

33:40.349 --> 33:44.180
- l mean, are you sure?
- Yeah, totally.

33:44.812 --> 33:47.598
l can't believe l let him go home.
l should have taken him with me--

33:47.773 --> 33:50.346
- That would have been kidnapping.
- Well, l gotta do something.

33:50.525 --> 33:53.774
Brandon, are you sure it's his mother?
l mean, maybe it's another kid.

33:53.945 --> 33:55.937
You know, some neighbourhood bully
or something

33:56.114 --> 33:58.355
- and he's too embarrassed to say.
- He wouldn't lie.

33:58.533 --> 34:00.406
Not about this.

34:01.577 --> 34:05.194
You know, if we report this,

34:05.539 --> 34:08.324
he'd be yanked out of his house,
put into foster care.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.168
Maybe he has a grandmother,
an aunt or anybody.

34:11.335 --> 34:13.079
- Maybe not.
- So, what do you say we do?

34:13.255 --> 34:15.627
Just let him stay at home,
let his mom keep beating him up?

34:15.799 --> 34:17.838
No, that's not what l'm saying.

34:18.009 --> 34:23.347
- l don't know. l'm not an expert.
- l know. l'm sorry.

34:25.016 --> 34:31.136
Look, there's a social worker
who used to work at the centre.

34:31.313 --> 34:34.929
l think we've gotta talk
to a professional person about this.

34:36.443 --> 34:39.478
l think
l'd better talk to my parents first.

34:40.822 --> 34:42.481
Thanks.

34:44.993 --> 34:47.114
So, what happened
when you went back to the table?

34:47.286 --> 34:49.527
Well, l had to apologise, of course.

34:49.706 --> 34:50.737
David's dad was very cool,

34:50.915 --> 34:52.989
but l could tell
he thought l was a total nutcase.

34:53.167 --> 34:55.324
Well, you are, Kelly.

34:55.503 --> 34:57.294
lt needs more garlic.

34:57.463 --> 35:00.547
So anyway,
the whole thing totally backfired

35:00.716 --> 35:02.625
and it brought them
even closer together.

35:02.801 --> 35:05.208
Well, Kelly, if it's meant to be,
it's meant to be.

35:05.387 --> 35:07.593
l mean, true love
is kind of like a locomotive.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.798
lt tends to flatten anything
that gets in its way.

35:09.974 --> 35:12.808
Tell me about it. l feel like Gumby.

35:13.770 --> 35:16.225
Gumby. He's flat.

35:16.731 --> 35:18.640
l'll get it.

35:22.361 --> 35:24.234
Hello?

35:24.613 --> 35:26.404
Oh, there's that voice
l miss so much.

35:26.823 --> 35:28.780
Dylan? You guys, it's Dylan.

35:28.992 --> 35:30.189
Hi, Dylan.

35:30.410 --> 35:33.612
There's the most incredible storm
happening right now.

35:33.830 --> 35:35.905
The sky's exploding
in all these bizarre colours

35:36.124 --> 35:37.867
and l just wanted to share it
with somebody.

35:38.042 --> 35:39.417
So you decided to call me.

35:39.585 --> 35:41.624
Well, l tried to call
my other girlfriends,

35:41.837 --> 35:44.623
but their lines were either busy
or disconnected.

35:44.799 --> 35:48.582
- Thanks, Dylan.
- Bren, one more thing.

35:48.802 --> 35:51.209
- What?
- l still--

35:51.638 --> 35:55.006
Dylan? Hello?

35:55.308 --> 35:57.929
Dylan, you still what? Dylan?

35:58.144 --> 36:00.848
- What? What happened?
- Who was that?

36:01.022 --> 36:02.432
Dylan.

36:02.607 --> 36:05.276
We got divinely disconnected.

36:05.610 --> 36:06.938
Thank God.

36:08.029 --> 36:09.487
- Hey, everybody.
- Oh, hi, Brandon.

36:09.655 --> 36:13.522
- Hey, there.
- You spent a long day with that boy.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.779
No, not really.

36:15.661 --> 36:18.994
- What's the matter? You look beat.
- No, Dad. l'm not.

36:19.164 --> 36:21.073
But l know someone who is.

36:21.249 --> 36:22.992
Brandon,
what are you talking about?

36:24.502 --> 36:28.084
Felix, the little kid
who we all thought was so cute?

36:28.923 --> 36:30.500
He's being beat up at home.

36:32.259 --> 36:35.923
- Are you sure?
- Wait a minute. Who's Felix?

36:36.096 --> 36:40.638
This kid that Brandon
was playing Big Brother to.

36:40.851 --> 36:43.520
He came over for dinner
and he had a french-fry freak-out.

36:43.687 --> 36:45.762
Brenda, that's because
l went to pat him on the back

36:45.939 --> 36:47.219
and he flinched.

36:47.399 --> 36:48.941
That's where his mom hits him.

36:49.108 --> 36:51.942
Brandon,
these are very serious charges.

36:52.111 --> 36:53.391
How can you be sure about this?

36:54.071 --> 36:56.146
l've seen the bruises and the welts.

36:56.324 --> 36:58.316
You wouldn't believe
that a parent could do that.

36:58.492 --> 36:59.867
Oh, my God.

37:00.035 --> 37:02.525
He said this was the first time
it's happened,

37:02.704 --> 37:04.363
but l don't know if l can believe it.

37:04.581 --> 37:07.498
lt doesn't make any difference.
Once is one time too many.

37:08.168 --> 37:11.453
Yeah, l know, so l talked to Andrea,

37:11.629 --> 37:14.748
and we're gonna go
see a social worker tomorrow.

37:14.924 --> 37:18.423
But the thing is, do l report it or not?

37:18.594 --> 37:22.377
- Brandon, you have to.
- But it's not that simple, Bren.

37:22.556 --> 37:25.046
Sometimes these kids get yanked
out of their homes right away

37:25.225 --> 37:26.339
and put into foster care.

37:26.518 --> 37:28.724
And l don't know
if Felix could take it.

37:28.896 --> 37:30.058
He feels abandoned as it is.

37:30.230 --> 37:32.305
His father walked out on him
when he was 3.

37:32.524 --> 37:35.643
Well, maybe he has a relative
or a friend he could stay with.

37:36.569 --> 37:37.683
Could he stay with us?

37:41.199 --> 37:44.365
Brandon, that's a very generous idea,
but l don't think--

37:44.535 --> 37:45.697
Dad, you can't turn your back

37:45.870 --> 37:47.494
on someone
you know needs your help.

37:47.705 --> 37:48.867
You let Dylan stay here.

37:49.081 --> 37:51.702
Sweetheart,
it's a completely different thing.

37:51.875 --> 37:55.243
l mean, Felix is a child.
He needs constant care.

37:55.420 --> 37:58.337
Besides, l'm not sure
it would do him any good to be here.

37:58.507 --> 38:01.176
What he needs is a safe,
permanent place.

38:01.384 --> 38:04.135
Brandon,
have you confronted his mother?

38:05.138 --> 38:10.013
No. l mean, what would l say to her?
She'll never admit it to me.

38:10.518 --> 38:13.139
Besides,
Felix made me promise not to tell.

38:13.312 --> 38:15.885
Well, you've just got to do
what's best for Felix, honey.

38:18.358 --> 38:19.982
l know.

38:31.579 --> 38:33.867
Don't worry. lt's off.

38:34.582 --> 38:36.539
Can l buy you a soda?

38:36.750 --> 38:37.947
No, thanks.

38:41.004 --> 38:42.996
Listen, David, l'm--

38:43.173 --> 38:45.580
l'm really sorry about being
such a bitch the other night.

38:46.343 --> 38:47.837
You think because
you're Kelly Taylor,

38:48.011 --> 38:50.418
l'm thrilled about our parents
seeing each other, don't you?

38:51.973 --> 38:54.546
Well, yeah, sort of.

38:55.351 --> 38:56.382
Maybe for a second.

38:56.561 --> 38:59.098
But the bottom line is
your mom's been divorced forever.

38:59.480 --> 39:02.895
And my parents,
their divorce isn't even final yet.

39:03.067 --> 39:04.098
So?

39:04.651 --> 39:07.485
So while it's cool
that my dad likes your mom,

39:07.654 --> 39:10.820
l just wish
he'd like my own mom more.

39:13.243 --> 39:16.279
- l don't know. lt's stupid.
- lt's not stupid, David.

39:17.580 --> 39:22.371
l mean, l can totally remember
l used to hope for the same things.

39:24.587 --> 39:26.912
lt's really hard when you realise
that's not gonna happen.

39:28.048 --> 39:30.585
That sounds like something
my therapist would say.

39:31.135 --> 39:32.878
My mom's therapist.

39:33.053 --> 39:35.259
She made me see him once.

39:35.472 --> 39:38.508
Trust me. l know how it is.

39:42.562 --> 39:47.270
So l guess
my mom really likes your dad.

39:47.817 --> 39:50.023
And vice versa.

39:51.570 --> 39:53.562
What are we gonna do?

39:53.739 --> 39:57.736
l mean, l guess what's important
is that they're happy together.

39:59.119 --> 40:01.444
Yeah, l guess so.

40:03.873 --> 40:05.331
Truce?

40:08.461 --> 40:13.834
Sweetheart, this could be the start
of a beautiful friendship.

40:32.358 --> 40:34.813
- Hi, Brandon.
- Hi, is Felix here?

40:34.986 --> 40:37.393
No, he's down
at the Valley Youth Center.

40:37.571 --> 40:40.061
But l appreciate all the time
you've been spending with him.

40:40.241 --> 40:43.490
- Yeah, well, he's a special kid.
- Yeah, he sure is.

40:45.329 --> 40:47.866
Suzanne,
can l talk to you for a second?

40:50.041 --> 40:51.120
Sure, come in.

40:55.046 --> 40:58.331
So can l get you a soda
or something?

40:58.508 --> 41:00.465
No. No, thanks.

41:03.846 --> 41:07.380
So, what's up?

41:08.809 --> 41:12.260
Well, what's up is...

41:15.106 --> 41:18.308
- Suzanne, l know.
- You know what?

41:19.485 --> 41:21.643
l've seen the bruises.
l know you beat Felix.

41:25.116 --> 41:28.282
What are you talking about?
l can't even believe what l'm hearing.

41:28.452 --> 41:30.527
- Look, l'm not a social worker--
- No, you're not,

41:30.704 --> 41:32.530
so why don't you get the hell out
of my house?

41:32.706 --> 41:34.745
- Suzanne--
- How could you even suggest

41:34.917 --> 41:36.708
that l could hurt my own child?

41:36.918 --> 41:38.744
Well, it seems
pretty unbelievable to me too.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.078
My parents never laid a hand on me
when l was a child.

41:41.256 --> 41:43.414
But Felix has bruises
all over his back!

41:44.133 --> 41:45.924
- What did that boy say to you?
- Nothing.

41:47.345 --> 41:51.424
He defends you. He thinks it's his fault.
He thinks he deserves it.

41:52.266 --> 41:54.223
Oh, God.

41:54.435 --> 41:58.728
l had a little too much to drink
and l hit him, but not hard.

41:59.940 --> 42:03.771
- And he didn't deserve it.
- So why'd you do it?

42:04.361 --> 42:06.982
Things got tough,
and l took it out on him.

42:07.155 --> 42:09.028
lt'll never happen again.

42:09.199 --> 42:11.357
Maybe you should get help
with these problems of yours

42:11.534 --> 42:13.028
so you don't take them out on Felix.

42:13.202 --> 42:14.696
How am l gonna be able
to afford that?

42:14.870 --> 42:18.369
l don't know. There must be some
free community social services--

42:18.541 --> 42:19.572
lt's not for me.

42:19.750 --> 42:21.789
Then maybe
you should do it for Felix.

42:23.045 --> 42:25.535
Look, Suzanne.

42:27.299 --> 42:30.050
l talked to my parents about this.

42:32.679 --> 42:34.837
They didn't think l should come here
and talk to you.

42:35.264 --> 42:38.098
They said l should call a social worker
and report the incident.

42:38.267 --> 42:39.464
They did?

42:39.644 --> 42:41.601
Maybe they were right.

42:43.689 --> 42:45.313
Well, maybe...

42:46.400 --> 42:48.392
Maybe there is somebody
l could call.

42:48.610 --> 42:50.317
A social worker or someone.

42:51.029 --> 42:52.736
Oh, God.

42:53.990 --> 42:56.990
l am so sorry.

42:58.286 --> 43:00.658
l'm so ashamed.

43:03.124 --> 43:05.994
You don't understand.
l am not that kind of a mother.

43:06.168 --> 43:08.326
Really, l'm not.

43:08.837 --> 43:10.959
l know, Suzanne.

43:12.049 --> 43:14.171
l know.

43:29.523 --> 43:32.725
Come on, you guys,
let's go see if lunch is ready.

43:36.113 --> 43:37.856
Hey, Felix.

43:39.574 --> 43:42.360
- What are you doing here?
- l came by to see you.

43:42.577 --> 43:44.320
Well, maybe l don't wanna see you.

43:44.537 --> 43:46.695
l guess
you're pretty mad at me, huh?

43:47.332 --> 43:50.001
You promised.
You promised you wouldn't tell.

43:50.168 --> 43:52.160
- Felix, l know it's hard.
- l miss my mom.

43:52.336 --> 43:54.542
l've been in here over a week.
When am l gonna go home?

43:54.714 --> 43:56.089
Soon, l hope.

43:56.257 --> 43:58.000
But Felix, your mom wanted you
to come here

43:58.175 --> 43:59.717
so she could get some help.

43:59.927 --> 44:02.334
So when you do go home,
you won't have to be afraid anymore.

44:05.807 --> 44:07.882
You know,
l thought you dumped me.

44:08.101 --> 44:11.185
- Just forgot all about me.
- No.

44:11.479 --> 44:15.772
l just thought you needed some space.
Some time to cool off.

44:20.613 --> 44:22.071
l guess you're right.

44:23.198 --> 44:25.653
Do l look like the kind of guy
who would bail on a brother?

44:25.826 --> 44:26.857
No.

44:29.663 --> 44:31.406
Thanks, Brandon.

44:32.249 --> 44:34.288
Anytime, Felix.

44:37.420 --> 44:39.708
Come on,
let's go get some lunch, huh?

44:39.881 --> 44:42.206
- Sure.
- Cool.

44:42.383 --> 44:44.920
- So, what have you been up to lately?
- Oh, not much.

44:45.094 --> 44:46.837
You wanna go
to the Kings' game next week?

44:47.012 --> 44:49.798
Yeah, that'd be great.

44:49.973 --> 44:54.515
So tell me something, Felix,
what's the food like in here?
