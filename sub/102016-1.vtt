I have plans for Mr. Kirby.

(Landon grunts)
You killing Landon
is not your fault.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.184
I'm gonna find a way
to save you both.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.561

Back?

Don't make it a big thing.

The Necromancer freed me

and she's just taking some time

Speaking of,
how is my boy Landon?
ALARIC: Getting Landon

03:13.151 --> 03:15.236
back is my top priority,
and I won't stop

03:15.278 --> 03:17.405

ALARIC: Something you haven't
had a chance to do

03:25.705 --> 03:27.624
in far too long:

03:27.665 --> 03:29.834
be kids.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.502
I want you to remember
what it's like

03:31.544 --> 03:33.421
to not have to worry about
something you shouldn't have to

03:33.463 --> 03:36.424
and grow closer together
in the process.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.135
Now, before you ask me how...

03:40.845 --> 03:43.514
As president of the
Student Activities Committee,

03:43.556 --> 03:46.017
I'd like to welcome you all

04:02.033 --> 04:04.702
As in an entire day spent
in an actual field.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.163
That's your plan to get everyone
to stop looking at Jo

04:07.205 --> 04:08.790
like she's an ax murderer?

04:08.831 --> 04:10.625
Have you got a better one?

04:10.667 --> 04:11.834
I'm so glad that you asked.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.753
Based on my own personal growth,

04:13.795 --> 04:15.755
I have created
a 17-step approach.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.217
Elizabeth, I have got time
for exactly one step,

04:19.259 --> 04:21.177
and that involves you
looking out for your sister

04:21.219 --> 04:23.179
while I deal with Landon,
among many other things.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.764
Dad, that's impossible.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.599
I'll have to deploy
the nuclear option,

04:26.641 --> 04:30.103
which is me backsliding to
using my mean girl bully pulpit

04:30.144 --> 04:32.146
to persuade everyone
to forgive and forget

04:32.188 --> 04:33.773
all the awful things
that Jo did.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.818
And I'm just not
that person anymore.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.820
Lizzie?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.200
(laughter)

04:45.451 --> 04:47.578
Oh, careful, witches.
Don't let her

04:47.620 --> 04:49.914
catch you laughing,
or she might snap.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.542
Your necks, that is.
(laughter)

04:57.213 --> 05:01.301
On second thought...

05:01.342 --> 05:04.387
let the games begin.

05:07.432 --> 05:08.433
Ted?

05:12.937 --> 05:16.649
S-Sorry to bug you, I-I think
I just forgot my headphones.

05:34.959 --> 05:39.547

Necromancer!

Ha ha!

05:42.258 --> 05:43.843

05:43.885 --> 05:48.681
Oh, if only I hadn't
treated you so badly.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.224
To make it up to you,

05:50.266 --> 05:54.103
I will raise any monster
of your choosing.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.522
A Pegasus, you say?

05:56.564 --> 06:00.693
Whatever your heart desires,
my dear friend.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.905
Rise.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.915
Er...

06:13.956 --> 06:15.416
that wasn't me.

06:22.173 --> 06:25.176
Whoa, you're no horsey.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.896
I am Nimue.

I'm-I'm Chad.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.153
Just Chad.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.947
I do require your help,

06:45.988 --> 06:48.282
if you are a worthy man.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.785
(loud bubbling)

06:52.412 --> 06:55.998
We must go. Now.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.335
ALARIC:
We have to keep this between us.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.503
The rest of the school
can't handle knowing

07:00.545 --> 07:01.879
Hope is down, too.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.506
What do you think's
wrong with her?

07:03.548 --> 07:04.590
The Necromancer must have
used black magic

07:04.632 --> 07:06.134
to take her out.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.094
Wait. I-I thought that
the spell that you did

07:08.136 --> 07:09.887
to bring all of us back
was unbreakable.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.014
Yeah, I don't know how
he got around it.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.350
But I know how to find out.
Where you going?

07:14.392 --> 07:18.020
To force some answers
out of that pompous ass.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.567
If you're gonna do this,
let me come with you.
Absolutely not.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.027
I know we need Hope, but we
need you at the school, too,

07:25.069 --> 07:26.279
or we'll definitely
fall apart.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.738
Look, maybe you can just
slow down

07:27.780 --> 07:29.073
and think about it for a second.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.617
My room isn't big enough
for three bodies.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.077
(grunting)

07:33.119 --> 07:36.164
must deal with

07:36.205 --> 07:39.667
this lying, cheating,
backstabbing miscreant.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.169
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.963
Get in there,
you insubordinate little...

07:44.005 --> 07:45.131
Landon.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.966
Hi.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.636
Sorry, bro.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.681
Can somebody tell me what the
hell's going on right now?

07:53.723 --> 07:56.476
You can see him.
Curious.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.852
Perhaps because
you were recently

07:57.894 --> 07:59.187
attached to me in death.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.439
I'm in possession
of the phoenix's

08:01.481 --> 08:04.108
infuriatingly stubborn spirit.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.444
But the dark magic
I was promised

08:06.486 --> 08:09.197
remains out of my grasp
until birdbrain here

08:09.238 --> 08:10.656
returns from the dead.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.994
Now all I need to do is
drop him back into his body,

08:15.036 --> 08:17.455
and we can all go about
our merry business.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.208
So what are you waiting for?

08:20.249 --> 08:22.960
The little pillock
won't come back!

08:34.764 --> 08:37.099
♪ One, two, three, four ♪

08:37.141 --> 08:39.101
♪ ♪

08:39.143 --> 08:41.312
(whistle blowing)

08:43.689 --> 08:45.024
(laughing)

08:48.903 --> 08:50.988
This is going so great.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.365
Right?
(chuckles)

08:52.406 --> 08:53.950
Except for whatever
Wade's doing.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.664
Uh, LARPing.
Oh.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.499
As a fairy faction of one.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.379
Like you said, so far so good.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.965
But the real test will be
when the different factions

09:09.006 --> 09:11.551
pick captains to start
playing games together,

09:11.592 --> 09:13.386
with vampires, witches
and werewolves

09:13.427 --> 09:14.720
on the same team for a change.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.848
Before that happens,
I just want to soak in

09:17.890 --> 09:20.726
this golden moment,

09:20.768 --> 09:23.062
when we both believed
that maybe,

09:23.104 --> 09:26.399
just maybe, your plan
would have worked.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.109
It will, just give it time.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.945
I can't. Not when Josie's
reputation is at stake.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.699
Okay. Lizzie, I know this
tone of voice.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.867
Please tell me what
you're getting ready to do.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.954
Nothing that you or I
will be proud of,

09:39.996 --> 09:43.082
so, like I said, remember this,

09:43.124 --> 09:45.835
and try and forget
what I'm about to do next, okay?

09:45.876 --> 09:48.337
Li-Lizzie. Lizzie...

09:48.379 --> 09:50.423
ALYSSA:
If I'm elected as your captain,
I want you to know

09:50.464 --> 09:53.467
that I'm only choosing witches
for my team.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.345
Because unity starts
in the coven.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.557
With one obvious exception
we can all agree on.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.976
So, all those
in favor,

10:02.018 --> 10:03.561
say...
Nay.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.690
Look, I know it has been
a tough time,

10:07.732 --> 10:11.485
so I would like to remind you

10:11.527 --> 10:13.029
of a simpler one.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.782
The way that things used to be.

10:18.659 --> 10:22.038
And what will happen
if you don't vote for me

10:22.079 --> 10:23.497
as your captain.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.042
Is that a threat?
Only to those

10:26.083 --> 10:27.960
dumb enough not to fall in line.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.799
Lizzie, don't do this.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.846
Josie.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.807
The same Josie
that we have known for years.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.976
Okay? The kindhearted,

10:44.018 --> 10:46.604
compassionate, considerate
Josie. The same Josie

10:46.646 --> 10:49.315
who would stick her neck out
for any one of you.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.941
(clears throat)
Don't!

10:52.693 --> 10:55.363
Yes, she messed up.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.823
But you've been messed up
your whole life,

10:57.865 --> 10:59.992
and we have all had
to deal with it.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.744
So, with a gentle reminder

11:01.786 --> 11:03.329
that I know where
you all live...

11:06.415 --> 11:08.918
...who votes for me?

11:12.296 --> 11:15.716
I truly appreciate
everyone's support.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.177
And for my first pick
as captain?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.306
Josie.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.225
ALYSSA:
Cool.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.937
me
I get to pick the game.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.439
ALARIC:
Quit playing games.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.982
Are you telling me
you're not powerful enough

11:32.024 --> 11:33.734
to force him into his body?

11:33.776 --> 11:37.071
enough? (gasps)

11:38.072 --> 11:40.783
I am the lord
of the restless dead.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.452
The judge of all men's fates.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.872
I swim laps in the River Styx.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.208
But even I have...

11:49.250 --> 11:51.752
(groans) limitations.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.171
Technically, I can
only raise a spirit

11:54.213 --> 11:58.384
to life if the spirit
or the host is willing.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.219
Well, that's a big technicality.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.179
LANDON:
At least it matches his ego.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.723
Never has a soul

12:03.764 --> 12:05.808
been so stubborn

12:05.850 --> 12:08.018
as to refuse
my gracious offer

12:08.060 --> 12:10.771
to return to this realm.
ALARIC:
Fine.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.899
We will convince Landon, okay?
But what about Hope?

12:13.941 --> 12:17.111
(laughing):
Oh, honestly,

12:17.153 --> 12:20.322
the last thing I need
is Tribrid hellfire

12:20.364 --> 12:22.533
raining down on me over this,

12:22.575 --> 12:26.996
so maybe us chaps just keep this
under our chapeaus until...

12:27.037 --> 12:28.205
(grunts)

12:28.247 --> 12:29.623
What did you do to her?!

12:30.666 --> 12:32.918
What are you blathering about?

12:32.960 --> 12:35.045
What's wrong with Hope?

12:36.213 --> 12:37.798
She won't wake up.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.133
And we think
that it has something

12:39.175 --> 12:40.885
to do with the black magic.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.511
That's not me.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.638
I haven't even gotten full use
of the magic yet.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.098
(sighs)

12:46.140 --> 12:47.850
You think you can work on Landon

12:47.892 --> 12:50.770
while I figure out
what happened to Hope?

12:55.441 --> 12:56.776
You should go help Dr. Saltzman.

12:56.817 --> 13:00.070
Yeah, I will.
Right after you come back.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.031
I can't.

13:02.072 --> 13:05.201
See? He's an unreasonable,
ungrateful git.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.788
Do you think I want you
to get any of that black magic?

13:08.829 --> 13:10.831
What?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.291
That's the reason why
you won't come back?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.752
Literally, everybody
else was cool with it,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.295
you fallow-breathed toad.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.965
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You're not helping.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.009
We both want the
same thing, right?
Yeah.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.136
All right, let me
talk to him alone.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.225
Fine.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.435
You have an hour.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.647
JOSIE:
This is gonna be a disaster.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.774
We need to rethink this.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.443
No way, Jo-say, because

13:39.485 --> 13:41.570
as stirring and intentionally
terrifying as my speech was,

13:41.612 --> 13:42.863
do you know what speaks
louder than words?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.824
Actions?
Winning.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.534
Alyssa wormed her way
on to a team

13:46.575 --> 13:49.453
full of vampires and werewolves
and chose tug-of-war.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.121
(indistinct chatter)
I mean, this rope

13:51.163 --> 13:52.957
weighs more than me.
I shouldn't be the anchor.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.708
immobilus.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.126
No, I can't do that.
Don't think of
it as cheating.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.462
Okay? Think of it as,
uh... taking action.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.798
The perfect hero move.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.883
No, no, no.
Lizzie, Lizzie, no, no, no...
(whistle blows)

14:02.925 --> 14:05.594
All right, Salvatore Stallions!

14:05.636 --> 14:07.054
Is everybody ready

14:07.096 --> 14:08.848
for some friendly
inter-faction competition?

14:08.889 --> 14:10.808
(cheering)

14:10.850 --> 14:12.059
♪ ♪

14:12.101 --> 14:14.061
Lizzie!
Thank you for your words

14:14.103 --> 14:15.479
of encouragement, Jo.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.231
I think I speak for
us all when I say

14:17.273 --> 14:20.109
it lifts our spirits

14:20.150 --> 14:21.527
to victory.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.071
We're ready.
Blow the damn whistle.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.616
(whistle blows)

14:27.658 --> 14:29.326
(cheering)

14:31.495 --> 14:33.539
(grunting)

14:42.339 --> 14:43.966
Jo, what are you waiting for?

14:44.008 --> 14:46.343
I told you, I can't!

14:46.385 --> 14:47.511
Come on!

14:48.429 --> 14:50.180
Abort! Abort!

14:57.521 --> 14:59.481
(crowd oohing)

14:59.523 --> 15:00.858
(laughs)

15:00.900 --> 15:02.568
(grunting)

15:06.739 --> 15:08.240
So...

15:09.867 --> 15:11.827
Josie's a mud monster
like Malivore.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.289
It all makes sense now.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.416
(laughter)

15:20.711 --> 15:22.963
I'm not following any of this.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.550
Look, if I stay dead,

15:26.592 --> 15:28.594
The Necromancer doesn't get
the dark magic that he wants,

15:28.636 --> 15:30.930
Malivore can't use
the phoenix as a vessel,

15:30.971 --> 15:33.515
and everyone that I love
will stay safe and alive.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.393
Hope is literally in
a hero coma. Hero moves

15:36.435 --> 15:38.520
always lead to...

15:41.273 --> 15:42.691
...tragedy.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.777
Okay.
So what do you want me to do?

15:47.279 --> 15:48.697
Let the bad guy win?

15:48.739 --> 15:50.783
Lan, out there
the bad guy wins every day.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.701
You know that as well as I do.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.787
Bad guy has been

15:54.828 --> 15:56.830
beating our asses since day one.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.415
So why does this
gotta be the time

15:58.457 --> 16:00.000
that you stop fighting back?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.045
LIZZIE:
Don't look at me like that.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.464
This never would've happened
if you had just

16:05.506 --> 16:07.424
cast the spell sooner.
Or if you'd just
listened to me.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.885
I can't do magic, Lizzie!
I put it away.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.388
LIZZIE:
What?

16:12.429 --> 16:14.098
(gasps) Why the hell

16:14.139 --> 16:15.349
would you do that
without telling me?

16:15.391 --> 16:16.392
I tried.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.601
It's okay, Jo.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.561
We're listening now.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.565
You trying to help
is the problem.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.609
Everybody should be mad
at me for what I did.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.946
And you trying,
it doesn't change anything.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.660
You're making everything worse,
like you used to.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.707
So please,

16:39.748 --> 16:42.042
please just let me deal
with this on my own.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.961
Jo...
Stop.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.921
I'm sorry.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.590
Um...

16:51.468 --> 16:53.929
That wasn't me.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.597
No magic, remember?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.308
WADE:
I can explain.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.768
Kind of.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.395
Or, well, she can.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.941
I am Nimue,
the Lady of the Lake.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.484
Protector of Excalibur,

17:07.526 --> 17:09.820
the enchanted blade of kings...

17:09.862 --> 17:10.821
KALEB:
Game of Thrones.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.947
We get it.

17:11.989 --> 17:12.948
WADE:
Translation:

17:12.990 --> 17:14.491
she wants the sword that I

17:14.533 --> 17:16.827
borrowed from
Dr. Saltzman,

17:16.869 --> 17:18.495
which, as
it turns out,

17:18.537 --> 17:20.372
is the actual Excalibur.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.001
But anyways, I figured

17:24.043 --> 17:26.086
I'd run it by you
all first, seeing as

17:26.128 --> 17:28.672
odds are fairly high that
she's, uh, one of the bad guys.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.923
LIZZIE:
Good job, Wade.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.675
As for you, sister,

17:31.717 --> 17:33.302
we do not
negotiate

17:33.343 --> 17:34.970
with Malivore monsters.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.096
If it is monsters
you fear,

17:36.138 --> 17:38.057
you must give me this blade.

17:38.098 --> 17:41.769
For a true monster is magically
bound to me by its power

17:41.810 --> 17:44.104
and pursues Excalibur
as surely as I do.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.731
Entrust the
sword to me,

17:45.773 --> 17:48.609
and I shall take it
to the protected isle of Avalon.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.111
If you hesitate,
this world

17:51.153 --> 17:54.156
will surely be plunged
into darkness.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.700
(snickers)

17:58.660 --> 18:00.871
Sorry. We've been through
this sort of thing

18:00.913 --> 18:02.664
way too many times.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.793
(heavy footfall in distance)

18:16.637 --> 18:20.140
(roars)

18:20.182 --> 18:23.018
On second thought, maybe you
should give her the sword.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.481
I'm afraid it is too late.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.482
MG, are you okay?
(grunting)

18:28.524 --> 18:30.400
I-I can't control it.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.617
(thunder rumbles)

18:46.834 --> 18:48.210
The challenge has begun.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.757
And only the worthy shall win.

18:59.888 --> 19:00.848
What the hell is that thing?

19:00.889 --> 19:01.890
The Green Knight.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.184
Once noble
and now a monster,

19:04.226 --> 19:07.396
his body and soul corrupted and
decayed as a result of the power

19:07.437 --> 19:09.606
he became unworthy
to wield,

19:09.648 --> 19:12.568
his thirst for more making
him a scourge upon mankind.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.778
Huh. Well, too bad for him.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.738
We already have one of those.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.951
JOSIE:
Why is he moving so slow?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.912
I placed a curse
upon him eons ago.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.165
As the Green Knight

19:26.206 --> 19:27.499
approaches Excalibur,

19:27.541 --> 19:28.625
he will move

19:28.667 --> 19:30.210
more slowly
with each step

19:30.252 --> 19:31.587
he takes.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.921
But he will reach it.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.214
And when last

19:34.256 --> 19:36.425
the Green Knight
wielded Excalibur,

19:36.466 --> 19:38.135
Camelot fell

19:38.177 --> 19:40.262
and the Dark Ages began.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.431
(heavy footfall)

19:42.472 --> 19:44.183
So how do we stop him?

19:44.224 --> 19:46.310
As the Green Knight
last held Excalibur,

19:46.351 --> 19:47.895
he is its rightful owner.

19:47.936 --> 19:51.231
Only a worthy challenger--

19:51.273 --> 19:53.233
a champion-- may defeat him.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.860
Now, I am
bound by duty

19:54.902 --> 19:56.361
to find one,
but if you

19:56.403 --> 19:58.947
do not believe
yourself capable of it,

19:58.989 --> 20:00.741
and you value your lives...

20:02.117 --> 20:03.827
...now is the time to run.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.289
(panicked chatter)

20:07.331 --> 20:08.415
JED:
Oh, come on.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.417
KALEB:
Really? Everybody?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.462
LIZZIE:
Pedro?

20:14.463 --> 20:16.215
When did you get here?

20:16.256 --> 20:17.424
The lower school's
finger painting.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.092
This is where I belong.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.510
(cracks knuckles)

20:20.552 --> 20:22.596
JED: Well, you came
to the right place, Lady.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.557
'Cause killing monsters
is kind of what we do.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.477
That is so hot.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.395
JED: You're damn
right it is.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.939
And I'm gonna recycle
this tin can.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.943
(growling)

20:35.984 --> 20:37.903
Wait! Jed, wait!

20:40.989 --> 20:42.157
(growls)

20:47.162 --> 20:48.872
(grunts, groans)

20:49.706 --> 20:50.707
Oh!

20:53.961 --> 20:55.712
(groans)

20:55.754 --> 20:58.090
(roars)

21:01.718 --> 21:03.470
LADY OF THE LAKE:
The worthy champion must

21:03.512 --> 21:05.055
wield Excalibur.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.600
Only its power can
fell the Green Knight.

21:10.477 --> 21:11.770
LIZZIE:
Cool.

21:11.812 --> 21:15.107
Thanks for telling us that now.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.486
So, who's it gonna be?

21:26.493 --> 21:28.537
♪ ♪

21:28.578 --> 21:30.831
Would it be that bad
to have a ghost roommate?

21:30.872 --> 21:32.833
I could float over teachers'
desks and get us test answers.

21:32.874 --> 21:35.294
I could, I could, I could, I
could drift around the hallways

21:35.335 --> 21:36.753
and see what girls are into you.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.505
Ghost wingman.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.800
Yeah, and, um,
when Hope finally comes back?

21:41.842 --> 21:44.386
She'll understand. She has to.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.930
If she were in my position,
she'd do the exact same thing.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.640
Are you sure about that?

21:48.682 --> 21:50.684
When she head-dove Josie,
she was taking a risk.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.228
She was willing to sacrifice
herself for the greater good.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.522
Now it's my turn
to make that sacrifice.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.194
No, Lan.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.990
Look, after
what I did to you,

22:05.032 --> 22:07.117
I think it's my turn.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.166
Hey.

22:14.207 --> 22:17.294
To bring back Landon,
you only need the spirit

22:17.336 --> 22:18.920
or the host
to be willing, right?

22:18.962 --> 22:20.839
Correct.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.633
And what is the
status of the spirit?

22:24.843 --> 22:26.636
Unwilling.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.473
So I want you to put
his spirit in me.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.687
Well, this just got spicy.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.157
ALARIC:
Look, here's the deal.
I can study every sleep spell

22:47.199 --> 22:49.409
known to man,
but... (sighs)

22:49.451 --> 22:52.454
I think we both know what's
going on, deep down inside.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.040
You know that Landon is dead.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.917
And you know that
if you wake up,

22:56.958 --> 22:59.503
you're gonna have
to face that grief.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.546
And as somebody who has
experienced that grief

23:01.588 --> 23:04.674
more times than I care to count,
I would never

23:04.716 --> 23:07.636
wish that upon you
or anyone else.

23:07.677 --> 23:11.223
But the truth is,
we need you here.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.603
Landon needs you.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.066
We all need you.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.112

LIZZIE:
Now, then. What if one of you

23:28.782 --> 23:30.742
just grabs the sword
and vamps it away?

23:30.784 --> 23:32.119
LADY OF THE LAKE:
The Green Knight
shall follow

23:32.160 --> 23:34.663
his challenger
to the ends of the earth,

23:34.704 --> 23:38.792
carving a swath of death
and destruction in its path.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.921
KALEB:
Yeah, that. So...
Okay.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.256
...not an option.
WADE: I brought
the sword here,

23:44.297 --> 23:47.008
so I should be the one
to face him.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.594
(growling)

23:52.639 --> 23:55.267
Unless someone has
a better idea.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.310
Anyone? Someone? Please?

23:57.352 --> 23:58.478
You heard the Little Mermaid.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.396
Beating this
thing isn't about

23:59.438 --> 24:00.439
who's at fault,

24:00.480 --> 24:01.481
it's about who's worthy.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.608
You know what?

24:03.650 --> 24:05.152
Dr. Saltzman put me
in charge, so...

24:05.193 --> 24:06.820
Throwing a field day

24:06.862 --> 24:08.989
doesn't make that sweet
ass of yours worthy.

24:09.030 --> 24:13.326
True worthiness comes from being
kindhearted, compassionate,

24:13.368 --> 24:14.661
considerate.

24:14.703 --> 24:15.829
So thank you,

24:15.871 --> 24:17.414
Lizzie, for reminding us all

24:17.456 --> 24:19.916
that your sister exemplifies
those qualities.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.751
It should be
her who faces

24:21.793 --> 24:23.044
an honorable
death against

24:23.086 --> 24:24.838
Gigantor over there.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.631
LIZZIE:
You know just as much
as I do that Josie

24:26.673 --> 24:29.843
is the least worthy person here,
even if she did do us

24:29.885 --> 24:32.220
all a huge favor by
getting rid of you.

24:32.262 --> 24:36.641
Because, for the record,
you're a killer, too.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.226
But hey,

24:38.268 --> 24:39.895
at least your parents
aren't here

24:39.936 --> 24:41.730
to see what you've become.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.781
If that's how
you really see me,

24:51.823 --> 24:54.367
then I guess I don't
belong here anymore.

24:54.409 --> 24:57.537
So I'm Team Monster now.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.998
Good luck beating one
without me.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.423
LIZIE:
Jo, I'm sorry.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.510
It shouldn't have
come out that way.

25:11.551 --> 25:15.514
You were just being honest,
so I should be, too.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.266
Alyssa was right.
It has to be me.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.603
Like hell...
Lizzie, this is exactly
what you wanted.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.105
It's what you've been trying
to make me do all day,

25:24.147 --> 25:26.399
a hero move to show everyone
how sorry I am

25:26.441 --> 25:28.068
and that I belong at the school.

25:28.109 --> 25:30.487
You don't have
any magic.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.489
What good will being back be
if you're dead?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.157
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.742
It's the same risk
that you, Hope,

25:35.784 --> 25:37.994
everyone made to bring me
back from the darkness.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.997
So I have to prove
that it was worth it.

25:41.039 --> 25:44.459
So please, don't try to stop me.

25:46.419 --> 25:49.005
Fine. Have it your way.

a-a lady monster came out of it,

27:33.985 --> 27:36.196
and she asked for
a worthy champion,

looking for Hope.

Uh...

27:51.670 --> 27:53.004
Uh, she was in search
of a sword?

27:53.046 --> 27:54.255
Ah.

27:54.297 --> 27:56.549
She sensed it was in a field?

27:58.718 --> 27:59.761
The field day.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.888
We should go help them.

We've all tried and we're

28:19.739 --> 28:21.574
You led me to believe
that you were capable

28:21.616 --> 28:23.243
of vanquishing monsters.

28:23.284 --> 28:25.036
We usually are, but our main
champion's a little busy.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.038
Then there is no hope?

28:27.080 --> 28:29.332
That's the whole point.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.792
We're not worthy.

know who is.

So where the hell is Hope

28:39.843 --> 28:42.679
I mean, I... I wish I was wrong,

28:42.721 --> 28:45.306
but we have to prepare
ourselves for that.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.061
To make her proud of us

28:50.103 --> 28:52.564
for saving the day
just like she always does.

28:52.605 --> 28:54.983

do that is together.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.067

28:56.109 --> 28:59.362
So please, just believe in me

28:59.404 --> 29:02.115

Giving your being over to me

to save everyone else.
