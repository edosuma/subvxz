WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.075
I THINK YOU'RE
A LOUSY MOTHER.
 GABY WAS INSULTED.

00:04.075 --> 00:06.107
DID YOU JUST SAY THAT
TO MY FACE?

00:06.107 --> 00:08.109
I CLOSED THE DOOR TO ASK

00:08.109 --> 00:10.211
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE
MY NEW SENIOR V.P.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.343
LYNETTE CHOSE NOT TO MENTION
HER PREGNANCY.
 OH!

00:12.343 --> 00:14.515
YOU GET TO STAY IN SCHOOL.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.487
SUSAN TRIED TO PROTECT JULIE.

00:16.487 --> 00:18.189
YOU SHOT ME!

00:18.189 --> 00:20.121
THAT GUN IS UNDER OUR REAL NAME.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.752
I WANNA CALL THE POLICE.
 UH, JUST...

00:21.752 --> 00:24.195
AND ANGIE HAD TO PROTECT
HER SECRET.

00:24.195 --> 00:26.627
HIGH ROAD ALL THE WAY.
 THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.459
MM-HMM.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.766
(Mary Alice)
BREE HODGE HAD A PROBLEM.

00:35.766 --> 00:38.469
SHE DID NOT WANT
TO FALL IN LOVE

00:38.469 --> 00:41.412
WITH KARL MAYER.

00:41.412 --> 00:45.646
SHE WAS APPALLED
BY HIS TABLE MANNERS...

00:45.646 --> 00:48.449
WHAT?

00:48.449 --> 00:50.821
HIS PERSONAL ETHICS...

00:50.821 --> 00:54.155
WHAT?

00:54.155 --> 00:56.187
AND HIS WANDERING EYE.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.790
WHAT?

00:59.790 --> 01:04.435
NO, BREE DID NOT WANT TO FALL
FOR KARL MAYER,

01:04.435 --> 01:07.067
AND YET SHE KNEW IN HER HEART

01:07.067 --> 01:09.370
THAT SHE WAS STARTING TO.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.173
AND THAT'S WHY SHE ALSO KNEW

01:12.173 --> 01:14.175
THE TIME HAD COME...

01:14.175 --> 01:16.707
WE HAVE TO TALK.
 TO LEAVE.

01:16.707 --> 01:20.151
(laughs) HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE FACE? YOU DUMPING ME?

01:22.113 --> 01:23.454
KARL...

01:23.454 --> 01:26.857
OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE DUMPING ME.

01:26.857 --> 01:29.460
WE'VE BOTH KNOWN
THIS COULDN'T LAST FOREVER,

01:29.460 --> 01:31.762
SO LET'S END IT NOW
BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.

01:31.762 --> 01:34.595
BUT IT'S GOING SO WELL.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.328
I FEEL WE'RE GETTING CLOSER.
 WE ARE.

01:37.328 --> 01:39.300
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.104
WHEN I AGREED TO BE YOUR LOVER,
I FELT QUITE SURE

01:44.104 --> 01:46.106
THAT MY DISDAIN
FOR YOUR VULGARITY

01:46.106 --> 01:48.108
AND ASTOUNDING LACK
OF SCRUPLES

01:48.108 --> 01:51.582
WOULD PRECLUDE ANY CHANCE OF
MY DEVELOPING FEELINGS FOR YOU.

01:51.582 --> 01:53.514
BUT AGAINST ALL REASON,

01:53.514 --> 01:55.186
IT'S HAPPENING.

01:55.186 --> 01:58.189
I DON'T WANT
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH A MAN

01:58.189 --> 02:00.251
I'M NOT EVEN SURE I LIKE.

02:00.251 --> 02:03.824
I'M GLAD WE'RE BEING CAREFUL
ABOUT NO ONE GETTING HURT.

02:03.824 --> 02:07.828
PLEASE, LET'S NOT MAKE THIS
ANY HARDER THAN IT HAS TO BE.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.162
OKAY.

02:11.162 --> 02:13.464
YOU SAY WE'RE DONE,
WE'RE DONE.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.766
I WAS GONNA WAIT
TO GIVE YOU THIS LATER,

02:15.766 --> 02:17.808
MAYBE OVER DINNER
OR SOMETHING.

02:17.808 --> 02:20.841
I GUESS NOW IT'S SORT OF
A PARTING GIFT.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.743
I COULDN'T.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.875
OPEN IT.

02:28.219 --> 02:30.251
(gasps)
 (chuckles)

02:30.251 --> 02:31.822
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

02:31.822 --> 02:34.625
OH, AND IT'S INSCRIBED.

02:34.625 --> 02:39.460
"TO MY DEAR AND BELOVED...
IRENE"?

02:39.460 --> 02:40.931
IRENE WAS MY GRANDMOTHER.

02:40.931 --> 02:43.764
MY GRANDPA GAVE IT TO HER ON
THEIR FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.266
OH.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.269
WELL, SHE HAD NO GRANDDAUGHTERS,
SO SHE WILLED IT TO ME.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.271
SHE SAID,
"SOMEDAY YOU'LL FIND

02:50.271 --> 02:53.874
THE PERFECT WOMAN TO GIVE THIS
TO," AND SHE WAS RIGHT.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.377
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

02:56.377 --> 03:00.651
I'M--I DIDN'T PLAN
ON FALLING FOR YOU, EITHER.

03:00.651 --> 03:02.653
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU

03:02.653 --> 03:05.486
FOR WANTING TO RUN
THE OTHER WAY.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.489
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH...

03:08.489 --> 03:10.561
I LOVE YOU.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.595
AND IN THAT MOMENT,

03:14.595 --> 03:17.728
BREE KNEW THAT THE TIME
TO LEAVE HER LOVER HAD COME...

03:19.530 --> 03:34.745
AND GONE.

03:34.745 --> 03:36.417
ANN PETERSON

03:36.417 --> 03:39.490
WAS THE PRINCIPAL
OF FAIRVIEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

03:39.490 --> 03:42.593
AND SHE BELIEVED IN RULES.

03:42.593 --> 03:47.298
SHE USED THEM
TO TEACH HYGIENE,

03:47.298 --> 03:50.901
TO CONTROL BEHAVIOR

03:50.901 --> 03:54.835
AND TO INSTILL ORDER.

03:54.835 --> 04:00.371
YES, MRS. PETERSON
BELIEVED IN RULES.

04:00.371 --> 04:02.543
SHE ALSO BELIEVED

04:02.543 --> 04:05.546
THAT THOSE
WHO DIDN'T FOLLOW THEM

04:05.546 --> 04:07.718
SHOULD BE PUNISHED.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.255
OKAY, THE CAMERA IS ROLLING.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.257
ARE THERE ANY WORDS
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY

04:18.257 --> 04:20.461
BEFORE YOUR DAUGHTER MAKES
HER STAGE DEBUT?

04:20.461 --> 04:23.934
LET US PRAY.
 GABY, JUANITA IS
GOING TO SEE THIS.

04:23.934 --> 04:27.868
OH, TRUST ME, THIS IS NOT
FOOTAGE YOU'RE GONNA WANNA KEEP.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.940
WELL, I'M SORRY.
I TRIED TO WORK WITH HER.

04:29.940 --> 04:33.644
BUT YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW
YOUR DAUGHTER IS TALENT-FREE.

04:33.644 --> 04:35.806
SHE IS ONLY 7.
HOW BAD COULD SHE BE?

04:35.806 --> 04:37.808
WELL, I'VE ALREADY
LOOKED THROUGH THE PROGRAM

04:37.808 --> 04:40.311
TO PICK OUT A KID
WE CAN PRETEND IS OURS.

04:40.311 --> 04:43.484
I LIKE PAIGE GLOVER.
I'M GONNA BE HER MOMMY.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.587
(piano playing)

04:50.020 --> 04:52.323
MY NAME IS MILES STANDISH.

04:52.323 --> 04:56.497
WE HAVE COME TO SHARE WITH YOU
OUR BOUNTY.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.499
AND TO GIVE THANKS

04:58.499 --> 05:00.501
FOR THIS NEW LAND,

05:00.501 --> 05:04.335
WHERE WE ARE FREE
FROM RELIGIOUS PERSKACOOTION.

05:04.335 --> 05:06.737
(laughter)

05:06.737 --> 05:08.879
UH, UH, UM...

05:08.879 --> 05:11.782
WHICH ONE IS PAIGE GLOVER?
 (whispers) SHH, SHH.

05:11.782 --> 05:14.685
RELIGIOUS PERSPACOTION.

05:14.685 --> 05:16.587
UM...

05:16.587 --> 05:19.750
WHERE WE ARE FREE
FROM RELIGIOUS...

05:19.750 --> 05:20.891
(whispers) PERSECUTION!

05:20.891 --> 05:22.993
READ THE CORN!
I WROTE IT ON THE CORN!

05:22.993 --> 05:24.525
(sighs)

05:24.525 --> 05:26.927
PER--PERSKA... PROSSA...

05:26.927 --> 05:28.659
AW--

05:28.659 --> 05:29.960
AT THAT MOMENT,

05:29.960 --> 05:34.465
JUANITA SOLIS CHOSE TO UTTER
A CERTAIN 4-LETTER WORD...

05:34.465 --> 05:36.907
(audience gasps and murmurs)

05:36.907 --> 05:39.009
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

05:39.009 --> 05:42.373
I DID NOT WRITE THAT
 ON THE CORN.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.847
(sighs) JUST PROMISE ME

05:46.847 --> 05:49.850
YOU WON'T HAVE A FEW DRINKS
AND GET ALL KISSY WITH ME

05:49.850 --> 05:53.353
LIKE YOU DID LAST WEEK
AT THE BERMANS'.
 YOU TOLD ME YOU DON'T WANT
OUR FRIENDS TO KNOW

05:53.353 --> 05:56.857
WE'RE HAVING MARITAL PROBLEMS.
(rings doorbell)
 WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAUL ME
TO PROVE WE'RE OKAY.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.430
I DON'T LIKE PUBLIC DISPLAYS
OF AFFECTION.
 I KNOW.

05:59.430 --> 06:02.493
BUT THESE DAYS, THEY'RE THE ONLY
KIND I CAN GET FROM YOU.

06:04.435 --> 06:08.038
SORRY WE'RE LATE, MIKE.
 OH, THAT'S OKAY, COME ON IN.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.441
OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

06:10.441 --> 06:12.803
IT'S JUST A PIE, SUSAN.
I'VE BROUGHT THEM BEFORE.

06:12.803 --> 06:15.976
NO, THE BROOCH THAT YOU'RE
WEARING. IT'S... IT'S MINE.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.908
EXCUSE ME?

06:17.908 --> 06:20.781
KARL GAVE IT TO ME YEARS AGO.
CAN I SEE IT?

06:20.781 --> 06:23.484
WELL, I DON'T DOUBT
THAT IT'S SIMILAR, SUSAN,

06:23.484 --> 06:25.786
BUT IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE
THE SAME ONE.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.788
NO, YES! (chuckles)
THERE'S THE INSCRIPTION.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.961
TO HIS GRANNY IRENE! MIKE!

06:33.694 --> 06:36.627
THIS IS THE SAME BROOCH
I LOST TEN YEARS AGO.

06:36.627 --> 06:38.969
YOU SAY YOU LOST IT?

06:38.969 --> 06:41.532
YEAH. IT WAS BACK WHEN
KARL AND I GOT DIVORCED.

06:41.532 --> 06:44.535
ONE DAY IT WAS ON MY COAT,
AND THE NEXT... GONE.

06:44.535 --> 06:46.777
I NEVER KNEW WHERE IT WENT.

06:46.777 --> 06:49.910
(Karl) HI, EVERYBODY.
 WELL, NOW WE KNOW.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.012
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
SEE YOU, SWEETHEART.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.886
HEY, KARL, GET IN HERE. WAIT.
YOU ARE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

06:55.886 --> 06:59.790
BREE FOUND
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S BROOCH.

06:59.790 --> 07:01.792
WHAT?

07:01.792 --> 07:03.824
YES, THE ONE THAT SUSAN LOST.

07:03.824 --> 07:07.858
(Orson) WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY
COINCIDENCE.

07:07.858 --> 07:10.561
WHERE DID YOU GET IT, BREE?

07:10.561 --> 07:12.863
SHE BOUGHT IT. I-I'M ASSUMING.
 UH, YES,

07:12.863 --> 07:15.566
AT THAT LITTLE ANTIQUE STORE
DOWN ON PEARL STREET.

07:15.566 --> 07:17.037
YEAH, SO OBVIOUSLY,

07:17.037 --> 07:19.810
WHOEVER FOUND IT MUST'VE
SOLD IT TO THAT STORE.

07:19.810 --> 07:22.673
REMEMBER HOW MAD YOU GOT
WHEN I LOST IT?

07:22.673 --> 07:25.846
HE REALLY YELLED AT ME.
 YOU YELLED AT HER?

07:25.846 --> 07:28.519
I DON'T RECALL YELLING.
 YOU KINDA DID.

07:28.519 --> 07:30.921
"HOW COULD YOU LOSE
MY GRANDMOTHER'S BROOCH?!

07:30.921 --> 07:33.684
IT WAS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM!"
 UNBELIEVABLE.

07:33.684 --> 07:36.727
YEAH, THAT IT WOULD TURN UP
AGAIN AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

07:39.229 --> 07:43.664
WELL, I'M GLAD I CAN GIVE IT
BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.766
OH, IT'S YOURS.
YOU BOUGHT IT.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.768
OH, I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
WEAR IT

07:47.768 --> 07:51.001
KNOWING THAT KARL
GAVE IT TO YOU.

07:51.001 --> 07:53.904
WELL, HOW MUCH DID IT COST?
I'LL REIMBURSE YOU.

07:53.904 --> 07:57.908
NO NEED, DEAR.
TRUST ME, IT WAS A STEAL.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.584
(man) WHOA!
WE GOTTA GET HIM INSIDE.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.786
SHH. SHH. JUST HOLD ON.
JUST--OKAY. EASY DOES IT.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.889
(laughs) HOW CAN WE GET
SOME PANCAKES?
 (clatter)

08:08.889 --> 08:10.891
WHAT? OH, GEE.
 WATCH IT. WATCH IT.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.893
I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.
(laughs)
 SHH.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.596
(whispers) PORTER,
FOR GOD SAKES!

08:15.596 --> 08:18.599
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP!

08:18.599 --> 08:20.100
(normal voice) TOM?

08:20.100 --> 08:22.603
HEY, HONEY.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:22.603 --> 08:25.606
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE
AT THE LIBRARY STUDYING.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.678
W-W-WE WERE,
AND AFTER WE WERE DONE,

08:27.678 --> 08:30.010
I TOLD THE GUYS
I'D TREAT 'EM TO PANCAKES.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.644
BUT THE--THE PLACE WAS CLOSED.
 AH, SO WE PEED ON
THE BUILDING.

08:33.644 --> 08:36.515
GIVE IT UP, T-SCAV! YO!

08:36.515 --> 08:38.018
YOU'RE DRUNK.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.650
UH, I BEG YOUR PARDON.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.153
HE'S DRUNK.
I'M FACED. (chuckles)

08:44.254 --> 08:45.696
(moans)

08:47.698 --> 08:49.730
DO YOU HAVE A SINK?

08:52.663 --> 08:56.667
WHAT DID THIS LIBRARY HAVE,
A 3-DRINK MINIMUM?

08:56.667 --> 08:59.139
WELL, AFTER THE LIBRARY,
WE WENT TO A BAR,

08:59.139 --> 09:02.873
AND THEY GOT INTO
A CUTTHROAT GAME OF BEER PONG.

09:02.873 --> 09:04.675
EH--

09:04.675 --> 09:06.847
WELL, I'LL JUST
MAKE 'EM SOME PANCAKES

09:06.847 --> 09:08.849
AND TAKE 'EM HOME
IN THE MORNING.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.280
THE MORNING?!

09:10.280 --> 09:13.123
CAN I TALK TO YOU A SECOND,
T-SCAV,

09:13.123 --> 09:15.886
AWAY FROM THESE
BEER PONG CHAMPS?
 (sighs)

09:15.886 --> 09:18.328
ACTUALLY, THEY LOST AND--AND IT
WAS KIND OF CONTROVERSIAL--

09:18.328 --> 09:21.762
I DON'T CARE! THEY'RE NOT
STAYING HERE TONIGHT.
 COME ON! LOOK AT NIEDERMEYER.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.194
I CAN'T TAKE HIM HOME
TO HIS MOM AND DAD.

09:24.194 --> 09:27.798
YOU KNOW HOW PARENTS ARE.
 OF COURSE I DO! WE'RE PARENTS!

09:27.798 --> 09:30.040
(man vomits and belches)
 UGH.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.872
LOOK...

09:33.704 --> 09:36.006
I UNDERSTAND
YOU WANT THE KIDS TO LIKE YOU

09:36.006 --> 09:38.749
SO THEY CAN ELECT YOU
HOMECOMING KING OR WHATEVER,

09:38.749 --> 09:41.652
BUT YOU ARE NOT
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL

09:41.652 --> 09:44.014
TO HAVE SOME SECOND CHILDHOOD.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!

09:44.014 --> 09:45.916
OKAY. OKAY, I HEAR YA.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.959
(grunts)
HEY, I HEAR YOU, TOO.

09:48.959 --> 09:50.791
WANNA KEEP IT DOWN?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.923
(moans)

10:01.201 --> 10:02.703
AND AS PUNISHMENT,

10:02.703 --> 10:04.775
I'M HAVING JUANITA DRAFT
A LETTER OF APOLOGY

10:04.775 --> 10:07.638
TO EVERY CLASSMATE
AND FAMILY MEMBER WHO HEARD...

10:07.638 --> 10:10.080
THE VERB IN QUESTION.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.782
THAT SEEMS FAIR.

10:11.782 --> 10:14.014
AND OF COURSE, SHE WON'T
BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE

10:14.014 --> 10:16.717
IN THE FINAL TWO PERFORMANCES
OF THE THANKSGIVING PAGEANT.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.749
OF COURSE.

10:18.749 --> 10:21.051
AND SHE IS ALSO
ON CAFETERIA CLEANING DETAIL

10:21.051 --> 10:24.324
FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.
 ABSOLUTELY.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.196
UH, NOT SO FAST.

10:26.196 --> 10:28.659
I'M SORRY?
 OH, COME ON, MRS. PETERSON.

10:28.659 --> 10:31.662
A LETTER OF APOLOGY? FINE.
TAKING HER OUT OF THE PLAY?

10:31.662 --> 10:34.264
HEY, SHE DESERVED THAT
BASED ON HER PERFORMANCE ALONE.

10:34.264 --> 10:36.266
BUT LET'S NOT GO OVERBOARD.

10:36.266 --> 10:39.770
MRS. SOLIS, THIS SCHOOL HAS
A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY

10:39.770 --> 10:41.772
WHEN IT COMES TO PROFANITY.

10:41.772 --> 10:45.776
AND WE RESPECT THAT.
RIGHT, HONEY?

10:45.776 --> 10:47.778
STAY OUT OF THIS,
SWEETHEART.

10:47.778 --> 10:49.680
YOU NEED TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK
AT THAT POLICY.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.922
JUANITA MADE A LITTLE SLIP.
IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL.

10:51.922 --> 10:54.725
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE FLIPPED
THE BIRD AFTERWARDS.

10:54.725 --> 10:56.727
MY RULING STANDS.

10:56.727 --> 10:59.860
IF YOU CAN'T DO THE TIME,
DON'T DO THE CRIME.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.362
WHAT IS THIS,
SHAWSHANK ELEMENTARY?

11:02.362 --> 11:04.364
THIS SCHOOL IS NOT AT FAULT.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.296
IF YOU WANT TO ASSIGN BLAME,

11:06.296 --> 11:08.999
YOU MIGHT LOOK TO
YOUR DUBIOUS PARENTING SKILLS.

11:10.801 --> 11:13.744
OH, I WISH
YOU HADN'T SAID THAT.

11:13.744 --> 11:15.876
EXCUSE ME?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.978
WELL, JUANITA
LEARNED THAT WORD SOMEWHERE.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.781
AND YOU'RE SAYING
I TAUGHT IT TO HER?

11:20.781 --> 11:23.984
NO, I'M SURE IT WAS
WHISPERED TO HER BY THE WIND.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.417
(chuckles) LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MRS. PETERSON.

11:27.417 --> 11:31.061
I AM PULLING JUANITA OUT OF
THIS CRAPPY, CRAPPY SCHOOL!

11:31.061 --> 11:32.462
COME ON, CARLOS!

11:32.462 --> 11:33.924
OH.

11:33.924 --> 11:35.265
"CRAPPY," HUH?

11:35.265 --> 11:37.427
WHAT A SHAME
JUANITA WON'T BE HERE

11:37.427 --> 11:39.730
TO BLURT THAT OUT DURING
THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.

11:39.730 --> 11:42.973
OH, YEAH? WELL,
HERE'S A BLURT FOR YA--

11:42.973 --> 11:46.807
(school bell rings)
 ...AND THE HORSE
YOU RODE IN ON!

12:02.152 --> 12:03.854
DON'T SHOOT! IT'S JUST ME.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.958
RELAX, SUSAN.
IT WAS A JOKE.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.300
IS MIKE HERE?

12:10.300 --> 12:13.403
HE IS OUT ON A JOB.
 OH, DARN IT.

12:13.403 --> 12:17.307
I WANTED TO TALK TO BOTH OF YOU
SO I COULD APOLOGIZE.

12:17.307 --> 12:20.470
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS...

12:20.470 --> 12:21.812
(door closes)

12:21.812 --> 12:24.444
I'VE LET MY EMOTIONS
GET THE BEST OF ME.

12:24.444 --> 12:28.218
I'M SURE YOU'VE NOTICED
THAT MY BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN...

12:28.218 --> 12:29.519
(singsongy) CRAZY.

12:29.519 --> 12:32.752
HMM, JUST IN THE...
CLINICAL SENSE.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.155
WELL, THAT'S OVER.

12:35.155 --> 12:38.158
I DON'T WANT THERE TO BE
ANY MORE TENSION BETWEEN US.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.891
WHEN WE SEE EACH OTHER
ON THE STREET,

12:40.891 --> 12:42.893
I WANT US TO WAVE,

12:42.893 --> 12:44.995
NOT DIVE BEHIND
A GARBAGE CAN.

12:44.995 --> 12:49.169
OH, I DIDN'T DIVE. I...
JUST DROPPED MY KEYS.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.442
I JUST WANT THINGS
TO BE NORMAL AGAIN.

12:52.442 --> 12:55.075
LET ME PLAY POKER
WITH YOU AND THE GIRLS.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.507
IF YOU THROW A PARTY,
INVITE ME.

12:57.507 --> 13:02.312
MAYBE YOU AND MIKE CAN HAVE ME
OVER FOR A BARBECUE SOMETIME.

13:02.312 --> 13:05.886
GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED,

13:05.886 --> 13:09.419
I JUST DON'T SEE A BARBECUE
IN OUR FUTURE.

13:13.824 --> 13:16.196
FINE, SUSAN.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.529
I WAS JUST HOPING
TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN

13:19.529 --> 13:22.432
AND SHOW ALL THOSE PEOPLE
HOW WRONG THEY WERE.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.206
WHAT PEOPLE?

13:26.206 --> 13:29.809
THE ONES WHO KEEP TELLING ME
THAT I SHOULD SUE YOU FOR, UH...

13:29.809 --> 13:32.843
WHAT DID THEY CALL IT?
"RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT"?

13:32.843 --> 13:35.315
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.816
NEIGHBORS, WELL-WISHERS,

13:36.816 --> 13:39.119
A COUPLE OF LAWYERS
WHO DABBLE IN CIVIL LAWSUITS.

13:39.119 --> 13:43.994
BUT I TOLD THEM,
"NO, I COULD NEVER SUE SUSAN."

13:43.994 --> 13:46.997
IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING,
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.

13:46.997 --> 13:49.229
BUT...

13:49.229 --> 13:51.531
IF THAT ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE...

13:51.531 --> 13:53.333
BRUNCH!

13:53.333 --> 13:55.035
UH... (chuckles)

13:55.035 --> 13:57.537
MIKE AND I AREN'T REALLY
BARBECUE PEOPLE.

13:57.537 --> 14:02.442
WE LIKE A GOOD BRUNCH. (laughs)
SO... LET'S GIVE THAT A SHOT.

14:02.442 --> 14:06.076
UM, I'M SORRY. THAT WAS JUST
A BAD CHOICE OF WORDS.

14:06.076 --> 14:09.449
(laughs) I LOVE IT!

14:09.449 --> 14:12.522
SUNDAY AROUND 11:00?
I'LL BRING A QUICHE.

14:12.522 --> 14:14.354
GREAT.

14:18.128 --> 14:21.161
AREN'T YOU GLAD
I'M NOT CRAZY ANYMORE?

14:21.161 --> 14:24.264
OH, YEAH.
THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.897
WE ARE OVER, KARL.

14:26.897 --> 14:29.399
(door closes)
 AND THIS TIME I MEAN IT.

14:29.399 --> 14:33.143
OH, COME ON, BREE. YOU'RE GONNA
DUMP ME OVER A LOUSY BROOCH?

14:33.143 --> 14:35.145
IT'S NOT THE BROOCH, KARL.
IT'S YOU.

14:35.145 --> 14:36.606
STEALING SUSAN'S JEWELRY

14:36.606 --> 14:38.648
AND THEN BERATING HER
FOR LOSING IT?

14:38.648 --> 14:41.581
WHAT KIND OF MAN DOES THAT?
 HOW ABOUT A MAN WHOSE WIFE'S
TAKING HIM TO THE CLEANERS,

14:41.581 --> 14:44.915
WHO WANTS TO GET BACK A LITTLE
OF WHAT SHE'S COSTING HIM?

14:44.915 --> 14:47.918
BUT HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID
AS TO THEN GIVE IT TO ME?

14:47.918 --> 14:50.961
DID IT NOT OCCUR TO YOU THAT
SHE MIGHT SEE ME WEARING IT?

14:50.961 --> 14:53.493
HEY, WHEN SUSIE AND I DIVORCED,
SHE LOST A LOT OF THINGS.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.495
I FORGOT THE BROOCH
WAS ONE OF THEM.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.498
THAT'S YOUR DEFENSE--THAT YOU
STOLE SO MUCH, YOU LOST TRACK?

14:58.498 --> 15:01.271
LET'S NOT FORGET
WHO HAD NO PROBLEM

15:01.271 --> 15:04.274
STAGING A FAKE BURGLARY
TO PROTECT HER STUFF FROM ORSON.

15:04.274 --> 15:06.306
WELL, I AM NOT PROUD
OF THAT.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.309
I AM EVEN LESS PROUD OF LETTING
MY LIBIDO BLIND ME TO THE FACT

15:09.309 --> 15:13.113
THAT I HAVE BEEN FORNICATING
WITH A MORALLY BANKRUPT WEASEL.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.445
WELL, NOT ANYMORE.
WE'RE DONE.

15:15.445 --> 15:17.517
WAIT.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.519
BREE...

15:19.519 --> 15:21.521
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

15:24.454 --> 15:27.057
EXCUSE ME?

15:27.057 --> 15:30.530
I KNOW, NOT THE BEST TIME
TO ASK.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.432
BUT I WAS SCARED IF I WAITED,
I WOULDN'T GET ANOTHER SHOT.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.436
DO YOU THINK FOR ONE INSTANT
I WOULD EVEN--
 DON'T FEEL YOU NEED TO ANSWER
RIGHT AWAY.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.138
I'M PRETTY SURE

15:38.138 --> 15:40.640
WHAT THE SHORT-TERM RESPONSE
WOULD BE. BUT, UM...

15:40.640 --> 15:44.174
I LOVE YOU, BREE.
 FOR GOD SAKES, KARL.

15:44.174 --> 15:48.018
AND I'D BE HONORED IF YOU'D EVEN
CONSIDER BECOMING MY WIFE.

15:48.018 --> 15:49.519
NO.

15:49.519 --> 15:52.482
I'M NOT DONE.

15:52.482 --> 15:55.485
THE MAN WHO SWIPED THAT BROOCH--
THAT WAS THE MAN I WAS.

15:55.485 --> 15:58.188
THE MAN I AM NOW
IS A LITTLE BETTER,

15:58.188 --> 16:01.261
BUT HE IS NOTHING COMPARED
TO THE MAN THAT I COULD BE

16:01.261 --> 16:04.394
WITH A WOMAN LIKE YOU
AS MY WIFE.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.539
THERE. DONE.

16:09.539 --> 16:11.701
KARL--
 DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

16:11.701 --> 16:14.044
JUST GO. THINK IT OVER.

16:14.044 --> 16:16.446
I ONLY WANNA SAY--
 BUP, BUP, BUP!

16:16.446 --> 16:17.577
JUST THINK.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.182
(knock on door)

16:53.213 --> 16:55.215
I HOPE
I'M NOT DISTURBING YOU.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.247
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR THE...

16:57.247 --> 16:59.018
OH.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.550
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:00.550 --> 17:04.094
YOU'RE CRYING. WHAT'S WRONG?

17:04.094 --> 17:06.096
NO, NOTHING. WHAT'S UP?

17:06.096 --> 17:07.396
OH, OKAY.

17:07.396 --> 17:11.161
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
HOW WELL OUR PLAN IS WORKING.

17:11.161 --> 17:12.531
OUR PLAN?

17:12.531 --> 17:15.704
YEAH, THE ONE ABOUT TAKING
THE HIGH ROAD WITH SUSAN.

17:15.704 --> 17:19.368
I WAS JUST OVER THERE.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE.

17:19.368 --> 17:21.070
WHO'S THAT?

17:21.070 --> 17:22.771
MY MOTHER.

17:22.771 --> 17:25.315
OH! WHERE DOES SHE LIVE?

17:25.315 --> 17:26.616
SHE DOESN'T.

17:26.616 --> 17:29.319
I'M SORRY.

17:29.319 --> 17:31.321
TOMORROW WOULD'VE BEEN
HER BIRTHDAY.

17:31.321 --> 17:33.583
EVERY YEAR THIS TIME
I GET A LITTLE DEPRESSED.

17:33.583 --> 17:36.656
SO LET'S GO OUT.
I'LL BUY YOU LUNCH.

17:36.656 --> 17:40.130
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO
FOR MY PARTNER IN CRIME.

17:40.130 --> 17:43.133
(sighs) OKAY,
YOU GOTTA STOP WITH THAT.

17:43.133 --> 17:46.136
WHAT?
 THIS "OUR PLAN,"
"PARTNER IN CRIME."

17:46.136 --> 17:49.469
THIS IS YOUR THING WITH SUSAN.
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO.

17:51.241 --> 17:54.204
OH, YOU'RE JUST UPSET
BECAUSE OF YOUR MOTHER.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.706
(gasps) YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:56.706 --> 18:00.550
I'LL BAKE YOU
A PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE.

18:00.550 --> 18:02.612
BEST THING IN THE WORLD
FOR DEPRESSION!

18:05.815 --> 18:08.188
(door opens)

18:08.188 --> 18:11.361
(sighs) WELL, I CALLED EVERY
PRIVATE SCHOOL IN THE AREA.

18:11.361 --> 18:13.223
NO OPENINGS UNTIL SEPTEMBER.

18:13.223 --> 18:15.225
(continues chopping vegetable)
 DAMN IT, GABY.

18:15.225 --> 18:17.827
YOU COULDN'T WAIT TILL SUMMER
TO CUSS OUT THE PRINCIPAL?

18:17.827 --> 18:20.630
I MAKE NO APOLOGIES.
SHE HAD IT COMING.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.632
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.

18:22.632 --> 18:25.505
SHE ATTACKED OUR DAUGHTER.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.507
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE SO DEVOTED TO JUANITA,

18:27.507 --> 18:29.509
'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT
TO BE SPENDING

18:29.509 --> 18:31.811
A WHOLE LOT MORE TIME
TOGETHER.
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:31.811 --> 18:34.144
I THINK WE HAVE OTHER CHOICE.

18:34.144 --> 18:36.146
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
HOMESCHOOL HER.

18:36.146 --> 18:38.318
(laughing) THAT'S FUNNY.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.820
OH, YOU'RE GOOD, CARLOS.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.753
WE NEEDED SOMETHING
TO CUT THE TENSION.

18:43.753 --> 18:46.196
BUT SERIOUSLY,
WHAT DO WE DO?

18:46.196 --> 18:47.357
SERIOUSLY?

18:47.357 --> 18:48.828
WE ENROLL ONLINE,

18:48.828 --> 18:51.601
THEY SEND US THE CURRICULUM,
AND YOU TEACH HER.

18:51.601 --> 18:54.164
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
BEFORE THIS GETS UGLY,

18:54.164 --> 18:56.336
YOU DO REALIZE I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TEACH.

18:56.336 --> 18:59.869
REALLY? YOU TAUGHT JUANITA
A FEW CHOICE WORDS.

18:59.869 --> 19:02.442
ME? HOW ABOUT YOU?

19:02.442 --> 19:04.374
WHAT A BLANK OF A DAY!

19:04.374 --> 19:06.776
EARL AT THE OFFICE
IS SUCH A BLANK.

19:06.776 --> 19:09.879
I WANNA KICK THE BLANK
 OUT OF HIS BLANK.

19:09.879 --> 19:12.382
OH, YEAH? HOW ABOUT,
THAT BLANKING HAIRDRESSER

19:12.382 --> 19:14.454
TOTALLY SCREWED UP
MY BLANKING HAIR!

19:14.454 --> 19:17.287
LOOK AT ME!
I'M TOTALLY BLANKED!

19:17.287 --> 19:19.789
THE BLANKING CLIENT
DIDN'T SIGN THE DEAL,

19:19.789 --> 19:22.292
AND WE LOST
A BLANKLOAD OF MONEY.

19:22.292 --> 19:24.394
WAH! BLANK, BLANK, BLANK!

19:24.394 --> 19:25.735
(sighs)

19:25.735 --> 19:29.369
OKAY. WE ARE BOTH AT FAULT.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.840
BUT YOU'RE
HOMESCHOOLING HER.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.442
FINE,

19:32.442 --> 19:34.674
BUT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO ISN'T
GETTING BLANKED TONIGHT.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.706
(sighs) FINE WITH ME.

19:36.706 --> 19:39.509
I BLANKED OFF EARLIER.

19:52.622 --> 19:54.694
THANKS AGAIN FOR THE PIE.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.367
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:57.367 --> 20:00.330
SO I SEE YOU'RE WEARING
THE BROOCH.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.302
I MUST SAY IT WAS
AWFULLY SWEET OF KARL

20:02.302 --> 20:04.304
TO GIVE YOU
HIS GRANDMOTHER'S JEWELRY.
 (faucet turns off)

20:04.304 --> 20:07.337
WHEN YOU WERE MARRIED, DID HE
DO THAT SORT OF THING OFTEN--

20:07.337 --> 20:10.310
SURPRISE YOU WITH LITTLE GIFTS?
 CONSTANTLY.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.412
REALLY?

20:12.412 --> 20:15.415
YEAH, OF COURSE, AFTER A WHILE
I KNEW THAT IT JUST MEANT

20:15.415 --> 20:17.547
THAT HE'D CHEATED AND WAS
FEELING GUILTY. (chuckles)

20:17.547 --> 20:20.250
ONCE HE WENT TO BARBADOS
AND BROUGHT ME BACK

20:20.250 --> 20:22.792
A PAIR OF SAPPHIRE EARRINGS.
I CRIED FOR DAYS.

20:22.792 --> 20:24.354
OH.

20:24.354 --> 20:26.356
SO... (sighs)

20:26.356 --> 20:28.328
WHY THE SUDDEN FASCINATION
WITH KARL?

20:28.328 --> 20:31.461
OH, I'M HARDLY FASCINATED,
JUST CURIOUS.

20:32.802 --> 20:35.305
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
YOUR MARRIAGE TO HIM,

20:35.305 --> 20:37.807
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE LIES
AND THE CHEATING,

20:37.807 --> 20:40.410
AND YOU NEVER REALLY TALK
ABOUT THE GOOD TIMES.

20:40.410 --> 20:43.373
WELL, THERE WERE
WONDERFUL TIMES.

20:43.373 --> 20:45.875
YEAH, HE WAS ALWAYS
A GOOD KISSER,

20:45.875 --> 20:49.018
AND HE COULD ALWAYS
MAKE ME LAUGH.

20:49.018 --> 20:53.323
YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS, IF HE
HAD BEGGED MY FORGIVENESS...

20:53.323 --> 20:56.856
I MEAN, IF JUST ONCE...

20:56.856 --> 21:00.360
HE HAD TOLD ME THAT HE WAS
WILLING TO CHANGE...

21:02.732 --> 21:04.694
OH!

21:04.694 --> 21:06.366
THE HELL WITH KARL.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.569
IN FACT, UM...

21:09.569 --> 21:11.441
HERE.

21:11.441 --> 21:13.603
NO, SUSAN. IT'S YOURS.

21:13.603 --> 21:15.875
NO, IT'S KARL'S.

21:15.875 --> 21:20.510
AND THE ONLY JEWELRY I SHOULD
BE WEARING NOW IS MIKE'S.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.782
WELL, IF YOU INSIST.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.784
AND BY THE WAY, THANKS.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.456
IT FELT GOOD

21:26.456 --> 21:29.719
TO SAY A FEW NICE THINGS ABOUT
KARL FOR A CHANGE, YOU KNOW.

21:29.719 --> 21:32.692
WELL, IT WAS NICE
TO HEAR THEM.

21:35.465 --> 21:38.768
HERE YOU GO, GABY.
IT'S KINDA OLD.

21:38.768 --> 21:41.871
IT'S FROM BEFORE
THE SOVIET UNION BROKE UP.

21:41.871 --> 21:43.673
THE SOVIET UNION BROKE UP?

21:45.074 --> 21:47.076
YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

21:47.076 --> 21:49.078
WITH THIS HOMESCHOOLING THING?
 OH, HONEY,
JUANITA'S IN FIRST GRADE.

21:49.078 --> 21:50.980
SHE'LL BELIEVE

I'M NOT SURPRISED.

21:58.548 --> 22:00.650

22:00.650 --> 22:02.652
WELL, I WASN'T GONNA
BRING IT UP,

22:02.652 --> 22:05.895

A LITTLE ROUNDER LATELY.

THIS WEIGHT IN ONE MONTH.

30:52.922 --> 30:55.955
WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE
ARE YOU SETTING FOR THEM?

30:55.955 --> 30:57.957
THE SAME ONE YOU'RE SETTING.

30:59.588 --> 31:02.091
WHEN GABRIELLE ASKED YOU
IF YOU WERE GAINING WEIGHT,

31:02.091 --> 31:05.064
DIDN'T YOU LIE?
 OH, CLEARLY THAT'S DIFFERENT.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.937
WHY?
 BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENCES.

31:07.937 --> 31:09.939
YOU COULD GET KICKED OUT
OF SCHOOL.

31:09.939 --> 31:12.571
AND YOU COULD LOSE
ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.444
(sighs) I'M GOING
TO TELL GABY THE TRUTH...

31:15.444 --> 31:18.247
EVENTUALLY.
 AND WHEN YOU DO,
SHE'LL TELL CARLOS.

31:18.247 --> 31:20.109
AND WHEN HE FINDS OUT

31:20.109 --> 31:23.252
THAT HIS NEW VICE PRESIDENT
LIED TO HIM, HE MAY FIRE YOU.

31:23.252 --> 31:26.285
YOU--YOU WANNA TALK TO ME
SOME MORE ABOUT CONSEQUENCES?

31:26.285 --> 31:29.488
I THINK THE WAY YOU'RE TRYING
TO RATIONALIZE YOUR BEHAVIOR

31:29.488 --> 31:32.061
IS PATHETIC.
 WE ARE TWO MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE,
LYNETTE.

31:32.061 --> 31:34.563
WE BOTH KNOW
THE VALUE OF PRINCIPLES.

31:34.563 --> 31:38.097

THAT WE'VE NEVER TOLD THE KIDS--

31:38.097 --> 31:40.599
THAT THERE ARE, SADLY,
SOME TIMES IN LIFE

IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.

32:13.502 --> 32:15.564
IRONING ISN'T GYM CLASS.

32:15.564 --> 32:17.566
HEY, WHO'S THE TEACHER HERE,
HUH?

32:17.566 --> 32:19.068
READ!

32:19.068 --> 32:21.270
YOU READ.

32:23.112 --> 32:25.044
JUANITA!

32:25.044 --> 32:26.715
(sighs) COME ON.

32:26.715 --> 32:30.419
LET'S JUST FINISH
THIS CHAPTER.

32:30.419 --> 32:33.522
(sighs)

32:37.126 --> 32:39.128
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

32:41.630 --> 32:45.264
I'M WARNING YOU.
I AM NOT PLAYING.

32:51.700 --> 32:55.674
JUANITA, SO HELP ME GOD...

32:55.674 --> 32:58.077
PICK IT UP!
 NO.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.749
PICK IT UP OR END UP
ON THE FLOOR NEXT TO IT.

33:08.417 --> 33:11.360
THANK YOU.
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.462
(thud)
 WHOOPS.

33:15.264 --> 33:18.597
HELLO?
SO WHAT DID WE LEARN TODAY?
 (Gabrielle and Juanita grunting)

33:18.597 --> 33:21.700
PICK UP THE BOOK! PICK IT UP!
 NO! NO!

33:21.700 --> 33:24.603
GABY, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?!

33:24.603 --> 33:27.076
IT'S CALLED HOMESCHOOLING!

33:27.076 --> 33:29.478
PICK... UP... THE... BOOK!

33:37.486 --> 33:39.488
I DID WHAT YOU ASKED, KARL.

33:39.488 --> 33:41.690
I WENT HOME AND THOUGHT
ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL.

33:41.690 --> 33:45.724
AND? NO, WAIT. NOT YET.
DO I NEED TO BRACE MYSELF?

33:45.724 --> 33:48.357
I'M NOT GONNA SAY NO.
 REALLY?

33:48.357 --> 33:50.359
OR YES. WHAT'S THE POINT

33:50.359 --> 33:52.501
WHEN I ALREADY HAVE A HUSBAND
I CAN'T SEEM TO SHAKE?

33:52.501 --> 33:55.734
SO FOR NOW, YOU MIGHT WANNA
FOCUS ON GETTING ME A DIVORCE.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.707
AND IF I DO THAT,
YOU'LL MARRY ME?

33:58.707 --> 34:01.770
NO, NOT YOU, BUT I AM INTERESTED
IN THIS OTHER KARL--

34:01.770 --> 34:04.473
THE ONE YOU SAY
YOU'RE PLANNING TO BECOME.

34:04.473 --> 34:07.676
YEAH, IF YOU MARRY ME.

34:07.676 --> 34:09.178
WELL, I'M AFRAID

34:09.178 --> 34:11.449
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO MAKE
AN APPEARANCE SOONER THAN THAT.

34:11.449 --> 34:14.353
(laughs) I THINK
I CAN ARRANGE A MEETING.

34:14.353 --> 34:18.257
OH! THAT'S ANOTHER THING.
NO SEX FOR AT LEAST A MONTH.

34:18.257 --> 34:22.130
A MONTH?
 YOU ARE TOO ADEPT AT USING IT
TO CLOUD MY JUDGMENT.

34:22.130 --> 34:24.632
I WANNA SEE YOU
THROUGH EYES THAT ARE CLEAR,

34:24.632 --> 34:28.266
NOT ROLLING BACK IN MY HEAD.
 SO I HAVE TO BE A GOOD BOY
AND NO SEX.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.268
IT'S LIKE WE'RE MARRIED
ALREADY.

34:30.268 --> 34:33.071
KARL, IF WE GO PUBLIC WITH THIS,
LET ALONE MARRY,

34:33.071 --> 34:35.244
THERE WILL BE
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.

34:35.244 --> 34:37.246
SUSAN MAY NEVER
SPEAK TO ME AGAIN,

34:37.246 --> 34:39.248
AND GOD ONLY KNOWS
WHAT ORSON WILL DO.

34:39.248 --> 34:41.280
I WILL NOT EVEN CONTEMPLATE
PAYING THAT PRICE

34:41.280 --> 34:43.712
UNTIL I'M SURE
YOU'RE DAMN WELL WORTH IT.

34:43.712 --> 34:46.554
AND IF CAN PROVE
THAT YOU ARE...

34:49.717 --> 34:51.820
THEN YOU CAN
GIVE THIS TO ME AGAIN.

34:51.820 --> 34:54.693
AND NEXT TIME,
IT'LL MEAN SOMETHING.

35:02.371 --> 35:04.173
(door opens)

35:04.173 --> 35:05.674
(door closes)

35:08.777 --> 35:10.309
(exhales deeply)

35:10.309 --> 35:13.312
WELL, DID YOU TALK WITH HER?
IS SHE READY TO APOLOGIZE?

35:13.312 --> 35:14.883
MM, NOT QUITE.
 (sighs)

35:14.883 --> 35:17.186
SHE HEARD WHAT YOU SAID
TO THE PRINCIPAL,

35:17.186 --> 35:19.188
AND SHE IS BLAMING YOU

35:19.188 --> 35:22.621
FOR HER NOT BEING ALLOWED
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.
 SO YOU DEFENDED ME, RIGHT?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.723
WELL,
THAT WAS A LITTLE TOUGH,

35:24.723 --> 35:29.498
WHAT WITH HER BEING RIGHT
AND YOU BEING WRONG.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN WRONG?
I DID WHAT I DID FOR HER.

35:29.498 --> 35:32.261
REALLY?

35:32.261 --> 35:34.763
YOU DON'T THINK THAT MAYBE
A TEENY BIT OF THAT

35:34.763 --> 35:37.266
WAS IN RESPONSE TO YOU BEING
CRITICIZED AS A MOM?

35:37.266 --> 35:38.467
NO!

35:39.768 --> 35:43.542
WELL, MAYBE "THE HORSE
YOU RODE IN ON" PART,

35:43.542 --> 35:46.545
BUT THE ORIGINAL SENTIMENT WAS
ALL IN DEFENSE OF OUR DAUGHTER.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.378
WHERE DOES SHE GET OFF
BEING MAD AT ME?

35:49.378 --> 35:51.420
GABY, SHE CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL
AND BE WITH HER FRIENDS.

35:51.420 --> 35:53.422
SHE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE OVER

35:53.422 --> 35:55.524
BECAUSE A CHIMP MAULED A CLOWN
AT HER BIRTHDAY PARTY.

35:55.524 --> 35:57.786
SHE HAS EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD.

35:57.786 --> 36:01.430
YOU... NOT SO MUCH.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.699
(sighs deeply)

36:14.172 --> 36:17.306
(dialing)

36:17.306 --> 36:18.677
(beep)

36:18.677 --> 36:21.780
(sighs)

36:21.780 --> 36:25.554
MA? IT'S ME.

36:25.554 --> 36:29.588
I KNOW. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
I'M SORRY.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.890
NO, YOU KNOW I CAN'T
TELL YOU THAT.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.223
JUST... KNOW THAT
WE'RE SAFE, OKAY?

36:34.223 --> 36:36.725
OH, MA, PLEASE, DON'T CRY.

36:36.725 --> 36:41.370
WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MINUTES
TO TALK, OKAY?

36:41.370 --> 36:43.802
HE'S GOOD. (chuckles)

36:43.802 --> 36:45.934
HE JUST TURNED 19.

36:45.934 --> 36:49.608
I KNOW. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

36:49.608 --> 36:52.881
YEAH, I WISH WE COULD, TOO.
UH, IT'S JUST TOO RISKY.

36:52.881 --> 36:55.884
BUT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS...

36:58.317 --> 36:59.848
MA, I GOTTA GO.

36:59.848 --> 37:02.851
I-I-I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.
 RIMANGA BENE, OKAY?

37:04.993 --> 37:08.427
HEY YA, KATHERINE.
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

37:08.427 --> 37:10.729
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOUR MOTHER WAS DEAD.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.432
OH, YEAH.
THAT WAS MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.003
NICK'S MOM.

37:15.003 --> 37:16.405
OH!

37:16.405 --> 37:17.736
YOU CALL HER "MA"?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.608
WE'RE CLOSE.

37:19.608 --> 37:21.610
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME IN.

37:21.610 --> 37:24.343
THE FRONT DOOR WAS OPEN.
HERE.

37:26.014 --> 37:29.017
HEY, IS THAT ONE OF THOSE
PREPAID PHONES?

37:29.017 --> 37:31.620
OH, YEAH. WHEN NICK AND I
WENT ON VACATION,

37:31.620 --> 37:33.722
WE BOUGHT THIS TO CALL HOME.

37:33.722 --> 37:35.684
AND THEN WE HAD
SOME MINUTES LEFT OVER,

37:35.684 --> 37:39.458
SO I FIGURED I'D USE 'EM UP.
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, KATHERINE?

37:39.458 --> 37:42.561
WELL, I WANTED TO DROP OFF
THE CAKE AS PROMISED

37:42.561 --> 37:47.596
AND TELL YOU LAST NIGHT,
SUSAN AND I HAD A BIG FIGHT.

37:47.596 --> 37:49.698
SHE THREW ME
INTO THE BATHTUB.

37:49.698 --> 37:50.969
REALLY?

37:50.969 --> 37:53.772
FIRST SHE SHOOTS ME,
NOW SHE TRIES TO DROWN ME.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.774
I'M GOING TO THE POLICE,

37:55.774 --> 37:58.347
SO I'M GONNA NEED THAT GUN
FOR EVIDENCE.

37:58.347 --> 38:00.579
WHAT GUN?

38:00.579 --> 38:03.011
THE ONE SHE SHOT ME WITH.

38:03.011 --> 38:05.283
THE ONE DANNY GAVE JULIE.

38:07.656 --> 38:09.788
OH.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.791
LISTEN, KATHERINE, I REALLY
DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA

38:12.791 --> 38:15.824
GETTIN' THE POLICE INVOLVED.

38:15.824 --> 38:18.667
JUST STICK TO YOUR PLAN.

38:18.667 --> 38:23.071
I HATE THAT SHE CAN
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

38:26.475 --> 38:28.807
HEY.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.510
NICK'S NOT ITALIAN, IS HE?

38:31.510 --> 38:32.841
NO. WHY?

38:32.841 --> 38:36.785
'CAUSE YOU WERE TALKING
TO HIS MOTHER IN ITALIAN.

38:36.785 --> 38:40.649
OH, SHE LIKES IT.
MAKES HER FEEL SOPHISTICATED.

38:40.649 --> 38:42.621
(laughs)
 (chuckles)

38:42.621 --> 38:44.953
I HAVE A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT
IN 40 MINUTES.

38:44.953 --> 38:49.558
I REALLY SHOULD GET DRESSED.
BUT THANK YOU FOR THE CAKE.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.412
WHAT'S THAT, SWEETIE,
YOUR HOMEWORK?

39:03.412 --> 39:06.475
IT'S ALL HOMEWORK NOW,
ISN'T IT?

39:08.577 --> 39:10.879
LOOK, JUANITA,

39:10.879 --> 39:13.882
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
I USED TO GET PICKED ON

39:13.882 --> 39:15.884
BECAUSE I WAS THE LITTLEST KID
IN MY CLASS,

39:15.884 --> 39:18.657
AND I COULDN'T DEFEND MYSELF
FROM THE BULLIES.

39:18.657 --> 39:21.790
AND THEN I DISCOVERED
A PART OF ME THAT WAS BIG--

39:21.790 --> 39:24.032
MY MOUTH.

39:24.032 --> 39:26.695
AND I'VE BEEN FIGHTING BACK
WITH IT EVER SINCE.

39:26.695 --> 39:28.697
SO WHEN MRS. PETERSON
SAID THOSE MEAN THINGS,

39:28.697 --> 39:31.640
I HAD TO DEFEND YOU.
 WHY? I SAID A BAD WORD.

39:31.640 --> 39:35.073
IF YOU JUST LET HER PUNISH ME,
THIS WOULD ALL BE OVER.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.075
BELIEVE ME,
LEAVING THAT SCHOOL

39:37.075 --> 39:39.848
IS GONNA WIND UP
BEING A GOOD THING.

39:39.848 --> 39:42.050
MRS. PETERSON IS A BULLY.
 I LIKE MRS. PETERSON.

39:44.152 --> 39:45.914
(sighs)

39:45.914 --> 39:48.657
OKAY.

39:48.657 --> 39:52.661
I WAS WRONG,
AND I'M SORRY YOU'RE UPSET.

39:54.563 --> 39:57.696
YOU STILL THINK I'M A GOOD MOM,
RIGHT? (chuckles)

40:00.469 --> 40:02.000
HONEY?

40:02.000 --> 40:05.734
CAN WE JUST READ?

40:13.111 --> 40:15.614
I'M TELLING YOU,
KATHERINE CANNOT BE TRUSTED.

40:15.614 --> 40:18.617
THE WAY SHE TALKS ABOUT
STEALING MIKE BACK FROM YOU?

40:18.617 --> 40:20.619
SHE HAS COMPLETELY LOST IT.

40:20.619 --> 40:23.121
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.
MIKE AND I HAVE A NEW RULE.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.154
WE'RE GOING TO PRETEND
THAT KATHERINE DOESN'T EXIST.

40:26.154 --> 40:28.527
(chuckles)
 YOU THINK THAT'S GONNA
BE ENOUGH?

40:28.527 --> 40:29.658
YOU NEED TO GET HER
OFF THE STREET.

40:29.658 --> 40:32.661
KATHERINE HATES YOU,

40:32.661 --> 40:35.534
AND I'M NOT TALKIN' "DIRTY LOOKS
IN THE SUPERMARKET" HATE.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.536
THAT WOMAN IS DANGEROUS.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.007
DANGEROUS HOW?

40:39.007 --> 40:41.610
(sighs) OKAY.

40:41.610 --> 40:43.712
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M EVEN SAYING THIS.

40:43.712 --> 40:46.214
BUT DO YOU KNOW
WHERE KATHERINE WAS

40:46.214 --> 40:48.647
THE NIGHT THAT JULIE
WAS ATTACKED?

40:52.881 --> 40:56.755
NO. THAT'S CRAZY. UM...

40:56.755 --> 40:59.688
WHY WOULD KATHERINE
WANT TO HURT JULIE?

40:59.688 --> 41:03.031
YOU HAD JUST MARRIED
THE MAN THAT SHE LOVED.

41:03.031 --> 41:04.863
IT WAS DARK.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.696
A WOMAN WALKED
OUT OF YOUR HOUSE...

41:10.669 --> 41:14.042
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS JULIE.

41:19.648 --> 41:22.881
THERE ARE SO MANY RULES
IN THIS WORLD.

41:22.881 --> 41:25.584
THAT'S WHY WE MUST START
LEARNING THEM

41:25.584 --> 41:29.117
WHILE WE ARE STILL CHILDREN.

41:29.117 --> 41:31.690
WE ARE TOLD VERY CLEARLY...

41:31.690 --> 41:35.063
"DON'T SAY BAD WORDS."

41:35.063 --> 41:36.595
(starts engine)

41:36.595 --> 41:39.928
"YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO CHEAT ON TESTS."

41:42.671 --> 41:46.775
"IT'S NOT NICE
TO LIE TO YOUR FRIENDS."

41:48.807 --> 41:52.681
"YOU SHOULDN'T COVET A MAN
WHO ISN'T YOURS."

41:54.543 --> 41:59.287
(engine starts)
 "AND YOU SHOULDN'T
BETRAY A MAN WHO IS."

41:59.287 --> 42:05.694
SO WE GROW UP,
AND STILL WE BREAK THE RULES...

42:05.694 --> 42:10.528
COMPLETELY FORGETTING
THAT IF SOMEONE CATCHES US,

42:10.528 --> 42:13.061
WE WILL BE PUNISHED.

42:13.061 --> 42:15.564
HI THERE.
 YES, GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR.

42:15.564 --> 42:17.566
UH, I WAS HOPING TO REPLACE

42:17.566 --> 42:20.008
A CAMEO BROOCH
MY WIFE PURCHASED HERE.

42:20.008 --> 42:22.010
I'D LIKE TO SURPRISE HER.
 A BROOCH?

42:22.010 --> 42:24.172
UM, WE DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT HERE.

42:24.172 --> 42:25.844
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

42:25.844 --> 42:29.648
MY WIFE WAS QUITE SPECIFIC
ABOUT WHERE SHE PURCHASED IT.

42:29.648 --> 42:31.650
SORRY. UH, WE SELL FURNITURE.

42:31.650 --> 42:34.152
SHE MUST'VE GOTTEN IT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

42:34.152 --> 42:35.824
(telephone rings)
 UM, EXCUSE ME.
