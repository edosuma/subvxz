ALL SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT

00:38.267 --> 00:40.200

00:42.467 --> 00:45.267
-I GREW UP HERE IN PORTLAND,
OR JUST OUTSIDE OF THE CITY.

00:45.367 --> 00:49.967
I MET MY WIFE IN HIGH SCHOOL,
AND ACTUALLY GOT MARRIED

00:50.067 --> 00:53.433
THE WEEK AFTER I GOT DONE WITH
THE BASIC ACADEMY, SO...

00:53.533 --> 00:57.100
THE START OF MY CAREER
COINCIDES WITH THE START
OF MY MARRIAGE,

00:57.200 --> 01:00.367
IT'S TWO REALLY IMPORTANT
DATES IN MY LIFE.

01:00.467 --> 01:05.133
-WE ARE LOOKIN' FOR A GUY
WHO JUST ASSAULTED A GAL.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.833
HE RAN TOWARDS THE NORTH
AND THE WEST, SO WE THINK

01:08.933 --> 01:10.867
HE CUT THROUGH THE CEMETERY.

01:10.967 --> 01:13.533
WE'RE GONNA TRY
TO FIGURE OUT IF HE'S
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HERE.

01:13.633 --> 01:16.200
YEAH, I THINK HE MADE IT
THROUGH, THAT'S MY GUESS.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.767
-HE WENT THROUGH THIS LOT
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT?

01:18.867 --> 01:20.633
-Dispatcher:
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S
GONNA BE OUR GUY.

01:20.733 --> 01:22.200
-YUP.
-BREAK.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.833
9-8. HE'S GOT A KNIFE
IN HIS HAND.

01:25.933 --> 01:28.533
94 BREAK.
-PUT THAT KNIFE DOWN!

01:28.633 --> 01:31.067
-HE'S RUNNIN', HE'S GOT A
KNIFE IN HIS HAND, HE JUST
TOSSED IT DOWN,

01:31.100 --> 01:33.533
HE'S RUNNING ON 82nd.
-I'M GONNA GET HIM.

01:33.633 --> 01:37.133
-WE'RE GOIN' TOWARDS THE SOUTH,
WE'RE PARALLELING HIM
AT HOLGATE.

01:37.233 --> 01:39.367
-YOU BETTER STOP, DUDE!
-IT'S LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA

01:39.467 --> 01:42.467
TRY TO CUT EAST HERE
THROUGH EASTPORT.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.967
-STOP! YOU BETTER STOP,
GET ON THE GROUND NOW!

01:47.833 --> 01:51.133
(moans of pain)

01:51.233 --> 01:54.067
Man on sidewalk:
I GOT STABBED A BUNCH, SIR.
(moans)

01:54.167 --> 01:55.833
-PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.
-PUT YOUR HAND OUT!

01:55.933 --> 01:57.433
-GET YOUR HAND OUT!

01:57.533 --> 02:00.267
-YOU GOT HIM?

02:22.633 --> 02:24.300
-HE SAYS HE HAS SOME
STAB WOUNDS.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.500
-SHE STABBED ME
A BUNCH OF TIMES.
-STABBED YOU WHERE?

02:26.600 --> 02:29.367
-ALL OVER.
-WHERE, SHOW ME.

02:29.467 --> 02:32.967
(moaning)
-OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GET SOME
MEDICAL ATTENTION TO YOU.

02:33.067 --> 02:35.467
YOU HEAR ME, DUSTIN?
-YEAH.

02:35.567 --> 02:38.600
-SO, WHO STABBED YOU?
WHAT'S GOIN' ON? DUSTIN.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.367
-MICHELLE.
-DUSTIN. WHO?

02:40.467 --> 02:43.800
-MICHELLE.
-MICHELLE STABBED YOU?

02:43.900 --> 02:47.433
OKAY. WHY DID MICHELLE
STAB YOU?

02:47.533 --> 02:51.967
-SHE... (moaning)
-WHO IS MICHELLE TO YOU, MAN?

02:52.067 --> 02:55.133
-GIRLFRIEND.
-GIRLFRIEND? OKAY, WHAT DID YOU
GET STABBED WITH?

02:55.233 --> 02:58.233
-THAT BIG KNIFE.
-WHY WAS SHE TRYIN' TO STAB
YOU, MAN?

02:58.333 --> 03:00.300
-SHE WAS GOIN' PSYCHO.
-SHE WAS GOIN' PSYCHO?

03:00.400 --> 03:02.167
-YEAH, SHE STARTED YELLING
AT ME.
-WHY?

03:02.267 --> 03:05.733
-SAYIN' I SLEPT WITH THESE
OTHER GIRLS.
-OKAY.

03:05.833 --> 03:08.133
-MY SIDE--
CAN I LAY ON MY BACK?

03:08.233 --> 03:10.300
-IF YOU WANNA LAY ON YOUR BACK,
GO AHEAD.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.733
THANK YOU. LEAN YOUR HEAD UP
TO ME.

03:18.700 --> 03:21.833
-SHE RAN OUT
AND JUST STARTED YELLING,
AND I WAS LIKE, NO WAY."

03:21.933 --> 03:24.567
I STOPPED HER FROM IT.
-WHY WERE YOU RUNNIN' AWAY
FROM THE WHOLE THING, MAN?

03:24.667 --> 03:26.933
-BECAUSE THE GIRL'S
ALWAYS RIGHT.

03:28.300 --> 03:31.567
-OKAY.
-SHE PURPOSELY
JUST STARTED SCREAMIN',

03:31.667 --> 03:34.467
AND THEN SHE (bleep) STABBED ME.

03:34.567 --> 03:36.367
THE BLOOD ON HER IS
PROBABLY MINE.

03:36.467 --> 03:39.333
-I DON'T KNOW, I HAVEN'T
SEEN HER. I JUST SAW YOU ALMOST
GET HIT BY A CAR,

03:39.433 --> 03:40.867
RUNNIN' ACROSS THE STREET
OVER HERE.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.867
WERE YOU JUST TRYIN' TO GET
OUTTA THERE AS FAST
AS YOU COULD?

03:42.967 --> 03:43.967
-UH-HUH.
-OKAY.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.600
-I DIDN'T WANNA GET HER
IN TROUBLE.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.133
-OH, YOU DIDN'T WANNA
GET HER IN TROUBLE.

03:47.233 --> 03:48.233
-NO.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.167
I WISH SHE HADN'T STABBED ME.

03:50.267 --> 03:52.733
-OKAY. WHY YOU HAVE
TWO PHONES, MAN?

03:52.833 --> 03:54.433
-ONE IS HERS.
-ONE IS HERS?

03:54.533 --> 03:55.600
-YEAH.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.167
-HAS SHE TRIED
TO STAB YOU IN THE PAST?

03:57.267 --> 03:59.300
-NO, BUT SHE HAD THAT
BIG-ASS RAMBO KNIFE.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.500
-SO, HOW'D YOU GET
THAT KNIFE FROM HER?

04:01.600 --> 04:04.433
-I GRABBED IT.
LOOK AT MY LEFT HAND.

04:04.533 --> 04:07.567
-I SEE IT. IT'S CUT, MAN.
-OH, LORD.

04:07.667 --> 04:10.300
-OKAY. DOES THE LEFT HAND
HURT VERY MUCH?
-(bleep) YEAH.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.900
-YEAH?
-(bleep) YEAH.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.967
-THE STUFF ON YOUR CHEST,
IS THAT FROM THE FENCE?

04:14.067 --> 04:15.567
-IN THE FRONT?
-YEAH.

04:15.667 --> 04:16.767
-PROBABLY THE FRONT.

04:16.867 --> 04:18.833
-ALL RIGHT, THE AMBULANCE
IS HERE RIGHT NOW, DUDE.

04:18.933 --> 04:20.333
-HEY, DUSTIN,
CAN YOU LOOK AT ME, MAN?

04:20.433 --> 04:22.200
YOU HAVE ANY INJURIES
ON YOUR FACE?

04:22.300 --> 04:23.967
-LEFT HAND RIGHT THERE.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.400
-SHE IN THE AMBULANCE, MIKE?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.100
-I THINK SO.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.433
-HI.

04:37.533 --> 04:39.333
HOW ARE YOU?
-GOOD, HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

04:39.433 --> 04:41.500
-YOUNG LADY, IS IT OKAY
IF I TALK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.767
-OKAY.

04:42.867 --> 04:44.533
-OKAY. HOW ARE YOU DOING?

04:44.633 --> 04:46.067
-NOT GREAT.
-YEAH?

04:46.100 --> 04:48.767
-ALL RIGHT, HANG OUT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU.

04:48.867 --> 04:50.400
-SO, I WAS CHASING HIM,

04:50.500 --> 04:52.600
HE SLOWED DOWN RIGHT HERE,

04:52.700 --> 04:54.500
AND JUST KIND OF
WAS SLOWING DOWN,

04:54.600 --> 04:55.967
AND I CAME UP
AND PUSHED HIM ON THE GROUND,

04:56.067 --> 04:57.767
AND WE HANDCUFFED HIM.
-OKAY.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.267
DID YOU SEE HIM DROP THE KNIFE?
-YES.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.767
-I WANTED TO ASK YOU SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

05:02.867 --> 05:06.267
SO, HE GETS JEALOUS BECAUSE
YOU GET A TEXT ON YOUR PHONE?
-YEAH.

05:06.367 --> 05:08.800
AND THEN WE STRUGGLED
FOR THE KNIFE,

05:08.900 --> 05:12.333
AND HE HAD, LIKE,
THE SHARP PART OF THE BLADE,

05:12.433 --> 05:15.067
AND I HAD THE SAWING PART
OF THE BACK SIDE OF IT.

05:15.167 --> 05:16.833
AND THAT'S WHAT
SAWED MY HAND RIGHT HERE.

05:16.933 --> 05:19.433
-AND SO, ONE THING
LEADS TO ANOTHER,
-IT ALL HAPPENED REALLY FAST.

05:19.533 --> 05:22.167
-HE SMACKS YOU,
THEN HE PUNCHES YOU,

05:22.267 --> 05:24.200
THEN YOU GUYS GET INTO...

05:24.300 --> 05:26.133
-BASICALLY, HE STARTS
CHOKING ME OUT.
-A WRESTLING MATCH

05:26.233 --> 05:28.067
WHERE HE KNOCKS YOU DOWN,
GETS ON TOP OF YOU.

05:28.167 --> 05:31.267
-YEAH. THE KNIFE.
-AND SO YOU REACH AND GRAB
A KNIFE TO DEFEND YOURSELF--

05:31.367 --> 05:33.267
WHERE WAS IT?
-IT WAS JUST ON THE COUCH.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.100
-IT WAS SITTING
ON THE COUCH?

05:35.200 --> 05:37.533
-WELL, 'CAUSE HE HAD
HAD A KNIFE EARLIER,

05:37.633 --> 05:40.200
AND LIKE, THAT WAS MY KNIFE
FOR SELF-DEFENSE, BASICALLY.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.500
-THE ONE ON THE COUCH?
-YEAH.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.833
LIKE, THAT I JUST CARRY
AROUND JUST IN CASE.

05:43.933 --> 05:45.933
'CAUSE I MEAN,
OUT HERE IS SCARY.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.233
-YEAH.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.467
-THAT'S NOT
MY USUAL KNIFE,

05:48.567 --> 05:50.300
BUT THAT KNIFE
WOULD DO THE TRICK.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.167
I THINK I JUST, LIKE, BARELY
POKED HIM, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY WANT TO STAB HIM.

05:53.267 --> 05:55.067
-SURE. OKAY, AND SO
IT WAS A QUICK POKE.

05:55.100 --> 05:58.067
DID YOU-- YOU DIDN'T TRY
TO FORCE IT THROUGH OR ANYTHING?
-NO. NO, I DIDN'T--

05:58.133 --> 06:00.167
-WAS THE IDEA BEHIND IT JUST...

06:00.267 --> 06:02.767
YOU DIDN'T WANT--
WHAT WAS THE IDEA? TELL ME.
-I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT HIM.

06:02.867 --> 06:06.200
UH, TO GET HIM OFF ME.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.500
LIKE, I WAS, LIKE,
COULDN'T BREATHE AT ALL.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.233
REALLY, YOU KNOW,
AND LIKE, HE JUST
KEPT GETTING TIGHTER,

06:11.333 --> 06:14.067
AND LIKE, LOOSE ENOUGH
SO I WOULD KIND OF BREATHE,
YOU KNOW,

06:14.167 --> 06:16.600
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

06:16.700 --> 06:20.667
-SO, THE TWO OF YOU GET UP,
HE GETS THE KNIFE AWAY FROM YOU,

06:20.767 --> 06:22.700
YOU DECIDE--
-HE'S BLEEDING,
I'M BLEEDING.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.500
-YOU DECIDE, "WE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE."

06:24.600 --> 06:26.367
-HE SAYS-- YEAH.
-HE SAYS, "LET'S GO,"

06:26.467 --> 06:28.400
AND SO YOU GUYS
GET INTO A CAR,

06:28.500 --> 06:32.433
AND HE DROPS THE KNIFE,
AND YOU REALIZE "THIS IS
MY MOMENT TO ESCAPE,"

06:32.533 --> 06:34.867
AND THEN YOU FLEE ON FOOT
AND FLAG DOWN A COP.

06:34.967 --> 06:36.867
YES, THAT THE WHOLE THING?

06:36.967 --> 06:40.367
DID YOU THINK IF YOU DIDN'T
GRAB THE KNIFE, HE WOULD
HAVE KILLED YOU?

06:40.467 --> 06:42.633
-UH...
-WHAT DID YOU THINK
WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

06:42.733 --> 06:47.300
-THAT HE WAS GONNA BEAT ME UP
SO BAD THAT I WAS GONNA
PROBABLY JUST PASS OUT.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.067
-OKAY.
-KILL ME? UH,

06:49.167 --> 06:51.833
PROBABLY COULD HAVE GOT
TO THAT POINT, BUT I DON'T
THINK HE'D ACTUALLY KILL ME.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.833
-ON PURPOSE. SURE.
-I HOPE, BUT...

06:53.933 --> 06:56.267
AFTER THAT,
PROBABLY HE WOULD HAVE.

06:56.367 --> 06:57.900
'CAUSE HE-- YEAH.
-ALL RIGHT.

06:58.067 --> 06:59.367
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
-THANK YOU.

07:04.433 --> 07:06.800
-WELL, THERE'S THE KNIFE
HE HAD WHEN HE WAS RUNNING.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.767
ROLLED DOWN MY WINDOW
AND YELLED AT HIM
TO DROP THE KNIFE,

07:08.867 --> 07:10.367
HE JUST KINDA THREW
IT DOWN AS HE WAS RUNNING

07:10.467 --> 07:12.200
AND KEPT ON RUNNING.
IT'S A GOOD THING HE DID.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.633
-THAT'S A SHOOTING
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.767
'CAUSE IF THAT GUY CAME
TOWARDS ME BRANDISHING
THAT KNIFE

07:15.867 --> 07:17.667
RIGHT AFTER HE JUST
ATTACKED SOMEBODY,

07:17.767 --> 07:19.167
AND RAN FROM
THE POLICE TWICE,

07:19.267 --> 07:21.133
THAT'S A SCARY GUY.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.333
-MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

07:25.433 --> 07:27.767
WHY WE DO THINGS
THE WAY THAT WE DO.

07:27.867 --> 07:30.100
I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

07:30.200 --> 07:32.567
WHY WE'RE COMING ACROSS
PRETTY AGGRESSIVE AT TIMES.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.467
AND GENERALLY, ONCE WE EXPLAIN

07:34.567 --> 07:36.633
WHY WE'RE DOING THINGS THE WAY
WE'RE DOING THEM,

07:36.733 --> 07:39.367
PEOPLE TEND TO UNDERSTAND,

07:39.467 --> 07:42.600
AND TEND TO BE MORE
ON OUR SIDE.

07:44.667 --> 07:47.333
SO, WE'RE GONNA CHECK
THIS JEEP CHEROKEE OUT.

07:47.433 --> 07:51.500
THERE'S A JEEP CHEROKEE
ON THE STOLEN LIST
OF VEHICLES THAT I HAVE,

07:51.600 --> 07:54.067
AND I RECOGNIZE THIS ONE
AS POSSIBLY BEING STOLEN.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.433
(radio chatter)

08:00.867 --> 08:02.067
STAY IN THE CAR!

08:02.100 --> 08:03.767
STAY IN THE CAR!
FOOT BAIL.

08:03.867 --> 08:06.100
SOUTHBOUND ON MONTEREY.

08:06.200 --> 08:10.333
FOOT BAIL. MALE WEARING
A BLACK AND GRAY HOODIE.

08:10.433 --> 08:12.567
OR A BLACK AND GRAY FLANNEL.

08:12.667 --> 08:16.133
HE'S RUNNING
SOUTHBOUND MONTEREY,

08:16.233 --> 08:18.600
HE'S GONNA GO
EASTBOUND ON GABILAN.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.500
BEHIND THE GAS STATION.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.067
BEHIND THE GAS STATION
AT THE CORNER GOING
SOUTHBOUND IN THE ALLEY.

08:27.167 --> 08:29.467
-(sirens blaring)
HEADING SOUTHBOUND.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.267
HOPPING THE FENCE.

08:31.367 --> 08:34.833
HOPPING THE FENCE
TOWARDS CALIFORNIA.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.067
STOP THERE! STOP THERE!

08:38.100 --> 08:39.667
HOLD ON, HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.367
220 PAJARO,
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

08:45.467 --> 08:48.167
220 PAJARO.

08:48.267 --> 08:50.300
HE'S RIGHT HERE.
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!

08:50.400 --> 08:53.100
GET ON THE GROUND!
GET ON THE GROUND!

08:53.200 --> 08:54.567
ALL THE WAY DOWN.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.200
GIVE ME SOME LIGHT.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.633
(sirens approaching)

08:57.733 --> 08:58.933
I GOT A TASER.

08:59.067 --> 09:02.367
DON'T MOVE.
DON'T MOVE.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.167
-UH, HE STOLE A CAR.

09:04.267 --> 09:07.333
HE STOLE A CAR
AND THEN RAN FROM US.

09:07.433 --> 09:09.533
SO, THERE WAS A FEMALE
IN THE VEHICLE.

DOING TONIGHT?

17:08.833 --> 17:10.867

-ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE BACK.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.433

-CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.

17:29.167 --> 17:32.067

IN THE FRONT, AND A SET OF
KEYS IN THE BACK.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.700
-SET OF KEYS IN THE FRONT--
I DON'T KNOW.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.833

THE FRONT,

17:38.367 --> 17:39.800
ONE OF Y'ALL WAS IN THE BACK.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.500
-THE TWO BEERS THAT WAS IN
THE BACK, THOSE WAS MINE

17:41.600 --> 17:43.667
'CAUSE I BEEN AT THE CLUB.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU.

17:43.767 --> 17:45.767
-OKAY. I AIN'T ASKED
ABOUT NO BEER, THOUGH.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.067
-I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT I HAD.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.800

NO KEYS, NO NOTHING, SIR.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.333

17:56.967 --> 18:00.100
-BUT ANYBODY CAN HAVE
A GENERIC DESCRIPTION.
BLACK SHIRT ON BLUE JEANS?

18:00.200 --> 18:01.767
-BUT THAT'S PART
OF THE INVESTIGATION.

18:01.867 --> 18:03.867

18:11.067 --> 18:13.767
EITHER OR, 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW.
-YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU DON'T.

18:13.867 --> 18:17.200
-WELL, IF THEY CONFIRM YOU,
WHAT'S GONNA BE THE DEAL THEN?

18:17.300 --> 18:19.067
-WHAT'CHU MEAN THEY
CONFIRM ME? THEY CAN'T
CONFIRM ME!

18:19.100 --> 18:20.267
-THEY CAN'T?
-NO.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.367

19:08.100 --> 19:10.100
-HOW CAN I GET CONFIRMED
BY SOMEBODY I CAN'T EVEN SEE?

19:10.200 --> 19:12.700
-YOU COULDN'T EVEN SEE?
-I CAN'T SEE WHO THE PERSON IS!

19:12.800 --> 19:14.833
-HOW CAN I GET CONFIRMED--
-SIR, YOU'RE THE SUSPECT.

19:14.933 --> 19:16.433
-I'M NOT A SUSPECT, I--

19:16.533 --> 19:19.600
-HE'S WEARING HIS SHIRT.
THIS GUY IS ACTUALLY
IN HIS SHIRT.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.567
-THAT'S SOME KIND OF CRAZY,
MY GUY.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.867
YOU GONNA GET
IN YOUR VICTIM'S SHIRT?

19:23.967 --> 19:25.667
-LIKE, YOU MEAN THE PHONE
THAT WAS IN THIS GUY'S--

19:25.767 --> 19:28.533

KARMA'S CRAZY, ISN'T IT?

19:28.633 --> 19:30.333

19:35.133 --> 19:37.433

WHAT I THOUGHT.

19:39.167 --> 19:40.400
-OH, OKAY.

A LOT OF THINGS,

19:44.900 --> 19:46.433
BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY
LIE ABOUT THAT.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.700
-SO THAT WAS HIS SHIRT

police radio chatter)

20:03.600 --> 20:05.533
