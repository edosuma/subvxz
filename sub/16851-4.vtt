 Previously,
 on Children's Hospital.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.572
Your son's operation is over.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.140
- And?
- What do you think?

00:06.174 --> 00:07.708
- How'd it go?
- How do you think it went?

00:07.741 --> 00:09.543
I don't know.
You were in there.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.379
Maybe I wasn't.
Think this stuff over

00:11.412 --> 00:13.214
before you run
off at the mouth.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.815
Owen, a word with you.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.451
Is this about me sleeping
with your sister again, Sy?

00:17.485 --> 00:19.487
Oh, yes. But I'm begging
you to reconsider.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.323
She's going through a tough dry
spell. She could use it.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.358
No can do, bro.
You know my rule.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.794
You don't sleep with girls
who look like Ray Liotta.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.163
Bingo. And your sister
is totes Liotes.

00:29.197 --> 00:33.301
Ugh. Glenn, you cannot leave
your dirty socks in the fridge.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.735
You are such a neat freak.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.371
I pity the fool who ends
up being your boyfriend.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.839
You bitch.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.375
- Kiss me already.
- Oh.

[theme music]

00:49.317 --> 00:51.319
Who forgot to clean
out the coffee grinder?

00:51.352 --> 00:52.553
Sorry. That was me.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.189
You know how I am
before I have my coffee.

00:55.223 --> 00:58.159
Oh, Blake! Wear pants if we're
all in the kitchen together.

00:58.192 --> 01:01.229
Sorry, you know how I am
before I put my pants on.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.132
Oh, come on. Who got chocolate
sauce all over the counter?

01:04.165 --> 01:05.366
That's my blood, actually.
Sorry.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.501
- Oh, yeah?
- Ugh, guys! Ugh.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.137
This is crazy.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.672
We have to work out a system
for the mornings

01:11.705 --> 01:14.308
so that we're not all
on top of each other.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.444
I think we're avoiding
the larger issue here.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.512
That our apartment
isn't big enough for us.

01:18.546 --> 01:21.415
In other words, there's too many
of us for the apartment.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.451
Guys, which means
that one of us..

01:23.484 --> 01:24.852
...will have to move out.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.620
He's right.
It's the only way.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.855

Who's it gonna be?

01:27.888 --> 01:29.423
(all)
Blake.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.659
It can't be me.
My dad co-signed the lease.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.427
Not me.
I'm under house arrest.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.563
- What about Valerie?
- You're too afraid of me.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.697
Did we try Blake?

01:36.730 --> 01:37.898
(all)
Oh!

01:37.931 --> 01:39.767
- Yeah, we did. Remember?
- Oh.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.602
- Oh, what about Owen?
- No, not me.

01:41.635 --> 01:44.238
- Yeah, he's got a point.
- Hey, did we try Blake?

01:44.272 --> 01:45.673
Yeah.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.741
- I don't think so.
- Well, think about it.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.411
Uh..

01:50.444 --> 01:52.613
I guess it has to be one of us.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.756
Owen. O-ski.

02:02.790 --> 02:06.427
Listen, the kid in 311
has terminal cancer

02:06.460 --> 02:09.562
and the Dying Wish Foundation
has granted him one last wish.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.899
- I'm giving that to you.
- Dying Wish Foundation?

02:11.932 --> 02:13.934
Weren't they caught organizing
a dog fighting ring?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.869
- No, that was Michael Vick.
- Oh, yeah.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.405
I always get them confused.

02:17.438 --> 02:20.208
Yeah. So his death...
in your hands.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.543
Cool.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.713
I don't really know how
to end this conversation.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.816
- So...high five?
- Sure.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.652
Yeah.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.654
Hi, Dr. Flame.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.490
I thought maybe you'd like
to know that I'm going home..

02:36.524 --> 02:37.658
..for lunch.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.193
You want a medal?

02:39.793 --> 02:41.562
No, but really?

02:41.595 --> 02:44.632
You think you deserve an award
for going home and eating lunch?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.667
That what you think?
That what you think?

02:46.700 --> 02:48.236

- Good.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.796
I'm gonna help you forget
that you'll soon be dead.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.432
I'm allowed
to grant you one wish.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.467
- Cool.
- Yeah.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.002
Thanks, Dr... Maestro?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.704
Oh. Don't thank me, kid.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.806
You can thank
the Dying Wish Foundation.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.975
Now, what's it gonna be, sport?

03:28.008 --> 03:32.313
I wish for..

03:32.346 --> 03:34.482
...unlimited wishes.

- You little son of a bitch.
- Suck it, Maestro.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.952
That's against wish protocol.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.420
- What kind of nurse?
- Pregnant.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.355
I don't see any way around it.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.790
We'll flip a coin to see
who leaves the apartment.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.026
Wait. We can move in together,
share a room.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.462
That'd free up space
and everybody would be happy.

but I'm just, I'm not sure

04:23.931 --> 04:25.833
I'm ready to give up my place.

You know, between your room
and the john.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.372
Plus, if we move in together,
then the other roommates

04:31.405 --> 04:33.474
would know that we're dating.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.444
Right, and we're not ready
to tell them, yet.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.578
My Lola.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.014
[sobbing]

09:41.915 --> 09:43.350
Oh, Glenn.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.721
[sobbing]

09:49.156 --> 09:51.024
[sobbing]

09:51.058 --> 09:53.260
[all sobbing]

09:53.293 --> 09:54.594
Glenn.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.396
I'm ready now.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.831
Lola.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.335
Guys, we have
an announcement to make.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.204
- Lola and I have been dating.
- Surprise!

10:04.237 --> 10:06.740
[laughing]

10:06.774 --> 10:09.076
(Glenn)
'The look on your faces,
it's priceless.'

10:09.109 --> 10:11.178
Anyway, we're moving
in together into my room.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.047
And that leaves an
extra room in our apartment.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.283
I found a perfect way
to use that space.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.352
I know what you're thinking.
We put a TV and a treadmill

10:19.386 --> 10:21.989
in there so we can watch shows
while doing cardio.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.290
[all]
Oh.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.125
That's a great idea.
I love it.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.995
Well, I guess that solves
our overcrowding issue.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.262
[all]
Yay.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.665
[all cheering]

10:36.003 --> 10:38.305
- Whoo-whoo-whoo.
- Whoo-whoo-whoo!

10:38.338 --> 10:40.741
[Chase and Jonny singing
"We can all be friends"]

10:40.774 --> 10:43.677
* I drew a picture
and painted with my fingers *

10:43.711 --> 10:46.246
* You could do it too
if you want *

10:46.279 --> 10:49.850
* Just come on over
be my friend *

10:49.883 --> 10:52.652
* And we could do
the things we do *

10:55.088 --> 10:58.291
* Amaze me with all the things
you know too well *

10:58.325 --> 11:01.028
* You're just
my favorite person.. *

11:03.030 --> 11:04.865
(Sal Viscuso on PA)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

11:04.898 --> 11:07.835
'You know how they say
home is where the heart is?'

11:07.868 --> 11:11.104
'In our case, the heart is
in a cooler on the third floor'

11:11.138 --> 11:12.806
'because we're a hospital.'

11:12.840 --> 11:13.807
'That is all.'
