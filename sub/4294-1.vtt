13:48.694 --> 13:52.687
Could be. If it's Saudi, then it's
quite probably the work of Abu Hamza.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.563
Osama wannabe.
Lived in Iraq. Afghanistan.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.226
Sir, not to beat a dead horse,

13:57.303 --> 14:00.568
but if there was ever a time for us
to put boots on Saudi sand,

14:00.639 --> 14:01.867
I mean,
don't you think this is it?

14:01.941 --> 14:04.000
There's no way, Adam.
They will never allow it.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.407
Then let's just ask.

14:05.477 --> 14:08.344
The Saudi Royal Family cannot appear
as if they're losing control.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.076
If they lose control of their country,
lose control of the people,

14:11.150 --> 14:13.084
they risk losing
control of the oil.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.141
And that is not gonna happen.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.114
State Department.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.821
'We are in agreement
with the Saudi security assessment

14:20.893 --> 14:24.886
'that any additional American presence
on kingdom soil represents reckless risk.'

14:24.964 --> 14:26.556
AGENT: Oh, come on, risk?
FLEURY: Yeah.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.157
What's that?
That's not a reckless risk?

14:29.235 --> 14:30.259
Fuck it.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.834
You hang tight.
I'm gonna go get access.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.267
Keep your bags packed.
Keep your phones on.

14:37.343 --> 14:38.776
Some of you are gonna
get some calls.

14:39.678 --> 14:40.667

17:02.821 --> 17:05.255
Everyone's terrified,
so nothing moves.

17:05.324 --> 17:07.383
You and your team
aren't going anywhere

17:07.459 --> 17:09.790
and this meeting's
just a circle jerk, Ronnie.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.921
Attorney General Young is
gonna go through the motions

17:11.997 --> 17:14.192
because protocol says
we get an appeal.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.665
We'll be on record,
but you expect nothing more.

17:17.636 --> 17:20.298
I met with Prince Thamer
at Saudi Embassy

17:20.372 --> 17:22.670
15 minutes after hearing
this morning's news.

17:22.741 --> 17:24.766
And after speaking
with Thamer,

17:24.843 --> 17:27.710
I advised withholding
additional U.S. Personnel,

17:27.780 --> 17:30.510
because a large part
of the religious justification

17:30.582 --> 17:34.643
for these bombs is the presence
of current U.S. Personnel.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.550
More boots on Saudi soil

17:36.622 --> 17:38.419
is only gonna make
an already combustible situation

17:38.490 --> 17:39.957
that much more so.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.253
CANAVESIO: My two cents.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.157
The Saudis have not asked for F.B.I. Help.
They've done the opposite.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.858
This is just going to further complicate
an already deteriorating situation

17:47.933 --> 17:50.697
with one of our few remaining
allies in the Middle East.

17:50.769 --> 17:51.758
Rock solid logic.

17:51.837 --> 17:55.000
Well, we would like to be on the record
as saying the F.B.I. Would like

17:55.074 --> 17:59.272
an Evidence Response Team
on the ground in Riyadh now.

17:59.878 --> 18:03.939
Doesn't your team in that country
represent exactly the kind

18:05.150 --> 18:08.051
of target that these masters
would die for?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.350
They'd trade 10 of their own
for one of you.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.721
Not to go after criminals
because they might try to harm you

18:13.792 --> 18:15.783
is really not
a policy of the F.B.I.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.586
See, we try not to say uncle.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.087
We try.

18:19.164 --> 18:20.688
Let me put it to you
another way.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.996
Al Qaeda lost the first phase
of this war.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.091
And they know it.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.497
So a new zero-sum phase
has begun.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.572
'If you're a Westerner
or a moderate Arab

18:28.640 --> 18:32.440
'and you won't join us, we will let loose
the truly talented murderers.'

18:32.511 --> 18:34.103
Men like Abu Hamza.

18:34.346 --> 18:35.813
These are
operational commanders

18:35.881 --> 18:40.716
who plan, organize, train, brainwash,
preach extreme violence.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.513
These are the men
we're fighting.

18:43.589 --> 18:44.715
Duly noted.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.686
YOUNG: Anything else?

18:48.827 --> 18:51.318
Now, as far as
the public's concerned

18:51.997 --> 18:55.023
let's try to view this
through F.B.I. Agents' eyes.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.123
Is that clear?

18:59.438 --> 19:03.932
Sir, how do you suppose this is viewed
through F.B.I. Agents' eyes?

19:04.243 --> 19:05.335
Pardon me?

19:06.512 --> 19:10.346
I said, in this situation,
how do you feel this is viewed

19:10.415 --> 19:12.042
through our eyes?

19:14.119 --> 19:15.711
It's a variation of vengeance.

19:15.787 --> 19:19.518
When one of your own is killed,
agents lose their analytical skills.

19:19.591 --> 19:20.615
Kind of like a...

19:20.692 --> 19:22.319
Thirty-six hours.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.696
We don't do it in 36 hours,
we can forget it.

19:26.765 --> 19:28.790
Agent Fleury, Agent Mayes,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.694
I appreciate your passion.
Quite spirited.

19:32.771 --> 19:36.332
If you were running the F.B.I. ,
you might turn it into Patton's Third Army.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.273
Might be a good idea,
I don't know.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.722
My daddy used to fly a helicopter
up in Saudi Arabia.

19:50.789 --> 19:52.416
Is that right?
Now, where would he sit?

19:52.491 --> 19:54.459
Would he sit either here,
or would he sit over there?

19:54.526 --> 19:56.391
No, he used to sit
right here.

19:56.461 --> 19:57.758
And you want to know a secret?

19:57.829 --> 19:59.023
What?

19:59.097 --> 20:01.725
My daddy died in Saudi Arabia.

20:03.468 --> 20:06.335
Yeah. Your daddy died
in Saudi Arabia.

20:08.307 --> 20:09.797
You know your daddy
was my friend, right?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.240
Yeah.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.107
So that means
that now you're my friend.

20:13.178 --> 20:14.406
Yeah.

20:16.448 --> 20:19.383
So, since we're friends
you promise to take me flying

20:19.451 --> 20:21.181
when you know
how to fly this helicopter?

20:21.281 --> 20:21.453
Yeah.

20:21.553 --> 20:22.850
Good. Good.

20:22.921 --> 20:24.616

when it takes off?

the Royal Family tomorrow in your column?

21:27.352 --> 21:29.149
I'm gonna hit them
with a fucking sledgehammer.

21:29.221 --> 21:32.554
The bombings or other things?

21:32.624 --> 21:33.613
What's other
than the bombings?

21:33.692 --> 21:36.388
I know you've been tracking
our investigation on Al-Haramain, right?

21:36.461 --> 21:40.022
Yeah. Royal Family's donations
that end up blowing shit up.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.396
Yeah. Seat's taken.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.096
I need a favor.

21:46.171 --> 21:47.468
I don't do favors, Ronnie.

21:47.539 --> 21:49.837
Listen, Elaine, when this thing breaks
and it's gonna be real,

21:49.908 --> 21:50.932
I'm gonna bring it
to you first.

21:51.009 --> 21:53.034
I'm listening.

21:53.912 --> 21:55.641
I need you to call Thamer
at the Embassy,

21:55.714 --> 21:57.443
tell him that the F.B.I.
Is getting ready

21:57.516 --> 22:01.680
to lay out major Saudi VIP indictments
dealing with charity financing

22:01.753 --> 22:04.517
out of this Boston investment firm.
We're gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash

22:04.589 --> 22:06.284
and roll out some
hardcore embarrassment.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.417
And you tell them
I'm heading up the investigation.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.051
And I'm not the nicest
kid on the block.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.117
That's accurate.

22:11.196 --> 22:12.857
And all I need is
15 minutes tonight.

22:12.931 --> 22:13.989
Tonight?

22:14.066 --> 22:15.260
Come on. Exclusive.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.359
I know you like exclusives.

22:18.637 --> 22:20.264
I'll see what I can do.

22:28.413 --> 22:31.007
Your Excellency,
Special Agent Ronald Fleury.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.643
Listen, can we talk inside?
Sure.

22:33.719 --> 22:35.846
There's too many people in there
that know both me and you.

22:35.921 --> 22:39.118
I would like to keep this
as discreet as possible.

22:40.325 --> 22:43.556
I know you have a busy schedule.
It's just, so many people in there.

22:43.628 --> 22:46.119
Why don't we
pull up here and talk?

22:47.866 --> 22:52.235
<i>I had an interesting conversation
with a reporter from the Post.</i>

22:52.304 --> 22:56.001
She exaggerates a lot of things.
Me, I consider myself a friend.

22:56.441 --> 22:57.738
A friend of Saudi Arabia.

22:57.809 --> 23:00.937
I just need a little cooperation,
that's all.

23:01.413 --> 23:02.812
What kind of cooperation?

23:02.881 --> 23:04.212
Like clearance to land

23:04.282 --> 23:06.409
on the Prince Sultan's
airport tomorrow.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.749
One month would be
as soon as we could.

23:09.154 --> 23:12.123
One month. This is gonna go
down one of two ways.

23:12.190 --> 23:15.159
One, the F.B.I. Has evidence that
two Royal Family wives donated

23:15.227 --> 23:17.991
$10 million to three
Arab-American cultural centers

23:18.063 --> 23:19.496
right outside of Boston,

23:19.564 --> 23:21.930
and that some of that money
got to Jakarta

23:22.000 --> 23:24.400
and these mosques, and they have
training camps right next to them.

23:24.469 --> 23:26.130
It's just weird to see
little kids playing

23:26.204 --> 23:29.298
and then not-so-little kids
playing with guns right next door.

23:29.374 --> 23:32.104
It's just odd.
Don't you think?

23:32.177 --> 23:33.405
You have no proof of this.

23:33.478 --> 23:35.537
How do you know?

23:38.450 --> 23:40.577
It's gonna be big.
It's gonna be a big story.

23:40.652 --> 23:43.052
I mean, it's not just gonna be
in the metro papers.

23:43.121 --> 23:46.249
<i>It's gonna be in the Omaha Herald,
places like the Terrell Tribune.</i>

23:46.324 --> 23:48.019
You, you ever been
to Terrell, Texas?

23:48.093 --> 23:49.822
Good chili.

23:49.895 --> 23:51.157
What is your point?

23:51.630 --> 23:53.097
I want in immediately.

23:54.332 --> 23:55.663
Define immediately.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.463
Right the fuck now immediately.

24:07.512 --> 24:10.072
So, what was
Fran Manner to her?

24:10.782 --> 24:12.215
He taught her how to shoot.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.244
She introduced him
to his wife.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.922
And he got her
into the Bureau.

24:18.423 --> 24:21.017
They celebrated her graduation
at the IHOP

24:21.092 --> 24:23.322
until some townie called
Janet something.

24:23.395 --> 24:26.125
I don't know,
something not very nice.

24:26.198 --> 24:29.292
So the townie didn't see Fran
coming out of the head,

24:29.367 --> 24:33.030
but he definitely felt
Fran's uppercut shatter his jaw.

24:33.104 --> 24:35.368
Really? And he didn't get
bounced for that?

24:35.440 --> 24:38.136
No. No, Fleury took care of it.

24:38.210 --> 24:42.579
Yeah, I do know the post in Riyadh was part
of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran's career.

24:42.647 --> 24:46.276
Thank you. Janet, what did Fleury whisper
to you this morning?

24:51.289 --> 24:53.382
Grant's age is a liability.

24:57.863 --> 24:58.852

24:58.930 --> 25:00.124
Yeah, actually I didn't.

25:00.198 --> 25:01.222
Well, thank you, anyway.

Is that right?

25:06.238 --> 25:07.728
FLEURY: Nope.

25:07.806 --> 25:10.604
We bringing security?
No.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.905
This is really gonna suck,
I think.

25:12.978 --> 25:15.105
LEAVITT: All right, well
that's very questionable.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.841
MAYES: Dog giving birth.
'Whelp.'

25:16.915 --> 25:17.904
W-H-E-L-P-S? Whelps?

25:17.983 --> 25:19.109
Yeah.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.482
Bitch giving birth.
Whelp. Next word.

25:21.553 --> 25:23.350
A dog giving birth.

25:23.421 --> 25:24.445
SYKES: Right on.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.581
Is that what you thought
it meant?

25:25.657 --> 25:27.090
I know what it means.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.182
That's why I played it.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.558
And you didn't think it was
a hit and a scream.

25:30.629 --> 25:33.826
Like a 'welt' and a 'yelp'?

25:33.899 --> 25:35.059
Yeah.

25:35.767 --> 25:38.031
I don't have much here,
don't worry about it.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.503
Hey, what are four people
supposed to do

25:40.572 --> 25:42.005
over there in five days,
anyway?

25:42.073 --> 25:44.633
Aren't you the one that practically
demanded we go this morning?

25:44.709 --> 25:47.701
I didn't say 'I.'
I said 'F.B.I.'

25:47.779 --> 25:48.768
Let's go.

25:48.847 --> 25:49.871
LEAVITT: I got it, I got it!

25:49.948 --> 25:51.210
Here it comes.

25:52.317 --> 25:53.477
False alarm.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.184
What's it like over there
on the ground?

25:57.255 --> 25:59.655
It's a bit like Mars.

25:59.791 --> 26:00.951
Mars?
Yeah.

26:01.026 --> 26:03.358
Sounds like
I didn't pack right.

26:04.029 --> 26:08.022
Well, I will be looked at with disdain
for pretty much the entire time

26:08.099 --> 26:10.659
we're on the ground.
Kind of like South Virginia.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.101

a beast in there, Fleury.

42:05.489 --> 42:08.617
Listen. This is not
a game show, Mr. Fleury.

42:08.792 --> 42:11.352
And definitely there are
no deals made here.

42:11.562 --> 42:14.224
There is me telling you
what you may or may not do.

42:14.298 --> 42:15.492
And there is you doing it.
That's it.

42:15.566 --> 42:17.796
You gonna tell me what to do.

42:17.868 --> 42:19.836
You will be permitted to
walk through the crime scene

42:19.904 --> 42:22.532
when we determine it is safe,
that's it.

42:23.073 --> 42:24.301
Any questions?

42:27.044 --> 42:29.239
By the way,
I don't like your jokes.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.380
What about witnesses?

42:37.054 --> 42:39.420
The witnesses?

42:39.490 --> 42:41.754
So you haven't interviewed
the witnesses?

42:42.393 --> 42:43.451
Not yet.

42:43.527 --> 42:44.755
Can we do that?

43:02.846 --> 43:04.438
We didn't really see anything.

43:05.015 --> 43:07.916
It was so fast and so loud.

43:08.719 --> 43:10.414
So nobody saw anything?

43:10.487 --> 43:13.650
I hit the deck.
The place was going Rambo.

43:13.724 --> 43:15.316
Guns, guns, guns.

43:15.392 --> 43:17.019
We went into our safe room.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.925
Safe room, what's that?
That room right there.

43:20.097 --> 43:24.193
Earl got an allowance of about $15,000
when we moved here to build it.

43:26.103 --> 43:29.971
We stayed in here,
till we heard the screams.

43:30.541 --> 43:32.441
Yeah, those kids were screaming,
all right.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.010
That's what got me out
of the house. Them kids.

43:35.145 --> 43:36.271
FLEURY: Which kids are those?

43:37.281 --> 43:40.250
Tracy Jackson.
She lived next door.

43:42.119 --> 43:46.078
She was murdered looking out
of her own window, in front of her children.

43:46.190 --> 43:48.488
Jacksons didn't have
a safe room.

43:56.433 --> 43:57.991
(KNOCKING)

43:58.068 --> 43:59.592
Mr. Jackson?

44:02.406 --> 44:03.737
(KNOCKING)

44:03.807 --> 44:07.038
Mr. Jackson. Aaron Jackson?

44:07.111 --> 44:08.135
Yeah.

44:09.847 --> 44:11.405
You keep him away from me!

44:11.482 --> 44:12.847
Hold on, hold on.

44:13.017 --> 44:15.042
Special Agent
F.B.I. Ronald Fleury.

44:15.285 --> 44:16.479
You know what?

44:16.553 --> 44:18.248
That's... Whoa, whoa.

44:18.589 --> 44:20.250
They're the ones
that attacked us.

44:20.324 --> 44:21.723
We don't know that just yet.

44:21.792 --> 44:23.157
That's what I'm here for.

44:23.227 --> 44:25.991
I just need to ask the boys
some questions about maybe something

44:26.063 --> 44:27.291
that they saw the other night.

44:27.364 --> 44:29.161
What do you want to ask my boys
about the other night?

44:29.233 --> 44:31.030
I told you...

44:31.101 --> 44:32.159
What do you want
to ask them about?

44:32.236 --> 44:34.397
You want to ask them about
watching their mother bleed to death?

44:34.471 --> 44:36.871
Is that what you want
to ask my boys?

44:37.708 --> 44:41.007
JACKSON: My 5-year-old boy,
when I got home, had a box of Band-Aids

44:41.512 --> 44:44.345
and he was trying to put
his mama's mouth back on.

44:49.887 --> 44:51.980
Is this what Mohammed
the prophet...

44:52.056 --> 44:53.318
Oh, come on, man,
let's not have a fight.

44:53.390 --> 44:55.153
Is this what Allah wants?
You know that, this isn't...

44:55.225 --> 44:56.453
This isn't gonna bring
your wife back.

44:56.527 --> 44:58.825
Does Allah love your kids
more than he does mine?

44:58.896 --> 45:01.694
Does Allah love your wife
more than he does mine?

45:02.166 --> 45:04.259
Leave me the fuck alone
and do not come back to my house!

45:04.334 --> 45:05.892
I'll leave you alone,
but just...

45:05.969 --> 45:07.664
I should have went home
a long goddamn time ago!

45:18.682 --> 45:20.377
AL GHAZl:
This is the big explosion.

45:21.385 --> 45:24.912
About one hour
into the rescue.

45:48.145 --> 45:49.510
LEAVITT: Where did
the water come from?

45:49.580 --> 45:51.047
They hit a water main?

45:51.115 --> 45:52.104
AL GHAZl: Water main?

45:52.182 --> 45:53.342
Yeah, where'd the water
come from?

45:53.417 --> 45:55.009
From a water pipe?
They break one?

45:55.085 --> 46:00.648
No, it's from the tanks
of this fire engine.

46:00.858 --> 46:05.056
This is the water that didn't,
how you say it, evaporate in the blast.

46:05.129 --> 46:06.960
This truck used to be here?

46:07.030 --> 46:09.396
We think so.

46:09.566 --> 46:14.162
This hole is the case.
Your men are contaminating this.

46:14.938 --> 46:18.465
You understand evidence?
Little things that are clues.

46:18.642 --> 46:22.169
Clues can be very helpful
to a fellow trying to solve a crime.

46:22.980 --> 46:24.470
You want to go into the hole?

46:24.548 --> 46:25.776
Yeah! Absolutely.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.176
No.

46:28.252 --> 46:29.685
All right.

46:32.556 --> 46:34.148
Who was running security?

46:34.224 --> 46:37.318
Security here is
a combination of police

46:37.394 --> 46:39.794
and National Guards of...

46:39.863 --> 46:41.490
(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)

(SPEAKING ARABIC)

46:54.611 --> 46:55.600
Please.

47:06.089 --> 47:07.784
AL GHAZl: This vehicle was stolen.

47:08.492 --> 47:12.019
A team outside the blast radius,
shooting at anything, everyone.

47:12.696 --> 47:14.789
Sergeant Haytham ended this part.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.772
Were any of the shooters your men?
Real Saudi police?

47:25.843 --> 47:27.208
No, they weren't.

47:28.078 --> 47:29.306
(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)

47:35.552 --> 47:36.644
Nice work.

47:38.755 --> 47:42.452
There were two officers in the car.
Both of them were executed.

47:46.430 --> 47:49.866
And those were your men.
I'm sorry.

47:54.004 --> 47:55.096
Car was parked here,
backed in?

47:55.172 --> 47:56.264
Yes.

47:56.540 --> 47:57.529
They were attacked
from the front,

47:57.608 --> 47:59.576
so they must have assumed
they were fellow officers.

47:59.643 --> 48:00.735
These guys been
identified yet?

48:00.811 --> 48:04.247
Not yet. It's likely that the four men
prayed in the same mosque.

48:04.314 --> 48:05.804
That's enough to identify them?

48:05.883 --> 48:06.941
If it's in Suweidi, yes.

48:07.017 --> 48:08.041
LEAVITT: Suweidi?

48:08.118 --> 48:10.018
MAYES: Suweidi's a known
militant stronghold.

48:10.087 --> 48:11.748
Al Qaeda could recruit
from the storefronts.

48:11.822 --> 48:13.813
Is there any way we can check out
those surrounding buildings.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.620
Like especially
that one right there.

48:15.692 --> 48:16.688
AL GHAZl: Why?
From the posting

48:16.788 --> 48:17.261
on the Internet

48:17.361 --> 48:19.420
the attack was filmed
from a high vantage point

48:19.496 --> 48:22.260
and that building right there
looks over the whole crime scene.

48:22.332 --> 48:23.799
It's outside the walls.

48:23.867 --> 48:25.164
Come on now,
this is damn insane.

48:25.235 --> 48:27.635
We got enough security to
invade North Korea and Suweidi...

48:27.704 --> 48:29.604
You don't know
what you are talking about.

48:29.673 --> 48:31.072
Can we just ask?

48:34.044 --> 48:35.102
Okay.

48:35.178 --> 48:37.408
All right. We'll be
in the Community Center.

will be available to you upon entry

49:01.204 --> 49:07.803

what the zealots follow in this stuff?

49:08.178 --> 49:09.406

I'm in Saudi Arabia.

50:40.737 --> 50:42.637
Yeah, you remember
where I showed you on the map?

50:44.608 --> 50:47.634
Well, right now I'm sitting
in the gym-slash-hotel.

He is...
He's, he's tall as ever.

51:05.062 --> 51:07.758
Yeah, and
we're looking for the bad guy.

51:08.465 --> 51:11.593
And I'm gonna get some sleep.
Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed.

51:12.002 --> 51:13.993
I love you, too.

blow out my eardrum.

There's the front gate,
the police car and the bomb site.

53:57.067 --> 53:59.661
And look.
That's about the same angle, right?

54:00.370 --> 54:04.136

the video on Al Saha?

54:04.307 --> 54:07.242
Look. Look right through there.
Same exact thing.

54:07.811 --> 54:10.371
This is too pretty of a plan
to be hatched in just one day.

54:10.447 --> 54:12.745
He had to come here
a couple of times.

54:13.283 --> 54:15.046
This man is a Saudi.

54:16.019 --> 54:18.283
See, if foreigners were here,

54:18.622 --> 54:20.487
someone would say something.

54:20.557 --> 54:22.889
So maybe Abu Hamza?
Could be.

54:22.959 --> 54:24.824
Yeah. Then we should ask around.
Get out of here and some people...

54:24.894 --> 54:26.486
They won't tell you anything.

54:26.563 --> 54:27.655
Why not?

we know he was here.

No.

tell you something.

Does every prince get
a palace this big?

Some get bigger.

for all this?

talk to you like subjects.

If he gives you to hold
his raptor, do not flinch.

57:36.820 --> 57:38.117
It is a compliment.

57:38.188 --> 57:39.951

Hold his rapture?

57:43.626 --> 57:45.253
His talons slice bones.

That right?

57:48.064 --> 57:50.055
That's my most prolific hunter.

57:50.834 --> 57:52.859
I try to teach his friend
over there,
