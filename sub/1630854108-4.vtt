Oh, I wish I could stay in bed,

but I have like 30 cameos
to shoot before work.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.632
Uh, the worst.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.095
Hey, last night was really fun.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.471
Really?

00:54.471 --> 00:55.806
I don't know if you could tell

00:55.806 --> 00:57.724
but that was my first time
with a lesbian woman.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.726
Okay, you don't need to say both,

00:59.726 --> 01:01.311
and I don't really use labels.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.063
Oh. Okay.

01:03.605 --> 01:04.898
Okay.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.901
I'm glad you're so cool about this.
So chill.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.279
The last time I got busy with a coworker,

01:10.279 --> 01:12.698
Reed, it got weird.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.992
Maybe because you
used the term "got busy."

01:14.992 --> 01:16.451
What do people say now?

01:16.451 --> 01:17.828
Fucking?

01:17.828 --> 01:20.163
Oh yeah. I'm used to network television.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.291
Look, don't worry.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.750
It's not weird.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.794
We're friends.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.129
Friends?

01:27.129 --> 01:28.755
I love that.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.509
It's been so long since I've
had a friend that was a woman.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.304
My last one was technically my assistant,

01:35.304 --> 01:37.181
but then she started charging my Amex.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.808
Like I'm not gonna notice
a charge for a Bowflex.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.352
Hey, if it's cool,
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

01:42.352 --> 01:45.105
Okay. Yeah. No, totally. Um...

01:45.564 --> 01:48.233
but, before you go in,

01:48.233 --> 01:49.401
I'm just...

01:50.986 --> 01:53.322

01:53.322 --> 01:55.073
a lady,

01:55.073 --> 01:57.242
did I do it right?

01:57.910 --> 02:00.537

Yes. Yes, I am.

'Cause I just remember
the only time you drank Gatorade

02:59.805 --> 03:02.808
is after, you know, getting busy, so.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.273
I didn't realize that
you were back out there.

03:09.273 --> 03:12.568
Well, Timberly and I went
out to a hotspot last night.

03:12.568 --> 03:13.861
It was really fun.

03:14.570 --> 03:15.863
- You and Timberly.
- Mh-mm.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.781
- That's weird.
- Why is it weird?

03:18.699 --> 03:21.034
Last week you tried to destroy her.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.328
I was being silly.
We're good friends now.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.331
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go do 40 cameos.

03:28.584 --> 03:31.461
You know, another interesting
thing about the Gatorade

03:31.461 --> 03:32.421
is that--

03:46.268 --> 03:48.729
Well, thank you again
for meeting with me.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.856
Oh yeah, of course. I'm stoked.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.817
None of the other executives
ever wanted to meet with me before.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.235
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.946
I even invited them to
my eighth birthday party.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.157
- Aw.
- Oh, it's okay.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.951
They were probably just freaked out
about having to wear bathing suits.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.411
How old were you

04:04.411 --> 04:06.747
when you first started working?
- Four.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.541
I said "ouchie" in a Band-Aid commercial.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.335
Pretty crazy working so young, huh?

04:12.169 --> 04:16.798
Actually, I started a little
business when I was six.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.300
Oh, cool. Like a lemonade stand?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.470
I invented a glucose
monitor for my diabetic cat,

04:21.470 --> 04:23.138
which was subsequently purchased

04:23.138 --> 04:25.015
by a pharmaceutical company.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.391
Awesome.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.227
So we both started in the medical field.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.187
Yeah.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.362
So, besides <i>Step Right Up,</i>

04:38.362 --> 04:40.239
do you have any other
projects in development

04:40.239 --> 04:41.657
that you're excited about?

04:41.657 --> 04:44.034
Actually, yes. Thank you for asking.

04:44.576 --> 04:48.247
I'm currently developing
a batting cage in my backyard.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.335
Boom!

04:57.381 --> 04:59.174
Uh...

04:59.174 --> 05:02.094
Ah, look at this.
A donut with bacon.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.762
Who do you think's gonna
have a heart attack first,

05:03.762 --> 05:04.847
me or my rabbi?

05:04.847 --> 05:07.724
Remember when they first
put potato chips in a can?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.059
You know what? I am tempted though.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.103
That's actually a fonut.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.689
It's gluten-free and the facon
is made with beans.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.440
Okay. Why would you tell me that?

05:16.733 --> 05:18.902
Hey, Reed, I'm confused.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.238
Does the Cody character
live above the garage

05:21.238 --> 05:22.447
or in the basement?

05:22.447 --> 05:25.033
Nobody knows. It's a whole thing.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.077
- Ugh.
- Oh, oh, Timberly.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.454
- Yeah?
- I heard that you and Bree
went out last night.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.497
Sure did.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.333
May I just say, brava.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.461
Bree's been having a rough go of it
since the divorce.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.505
Oh, I know. I was like, girl,

05:38.505 --> 05:40.382
you think you can't get it,
but you can totally get it.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.719
Uh, yes. And I understand she got it.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.637
Uh, yeah. She got it.

05:46.138 --> 05:49.725
Ah, well,
I'm very proud of her, you know?

05:51.268 --> 05:52.561
Nice guy, I hope.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.438
Well.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.398
Not a nice guy?

05:57.399 --> 05:58.901
It wasn't a guy.

06:00.444 --> 06:01.445
Oh.

06:01.445 --> 06:02.487
Hm.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.326
You?

06:07.993 --> 06:09.661
Hm.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.039
You two. You two?

06:13.332 --> 06:18.086
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.756
Did I just blow your mind, boomer?

06:20.756 --> 06:23.217
What, what?

06:23.217 --> 06:25.886
No, girl. That don't phase me.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.429
Hm?
Timberly?

06:27.429 --> 06:28.889
- Yeah?
- Mind if I steal you?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.516
We're about to block the basement scene.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.100
Is that where Cody lives?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.894
Please don't ask me. I can't.

06:39.525 --> 06:42.110
- I'm, uh, freaking out.
- About what?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.779
Never mind, I don't care.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.615
Last night I called Bree and she was

06:46.615 --> 06:48.450
uncharacteristically dismissive.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.744
Again, I could not care less
about this conversation.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.538
She was having sex with Timberly.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.622
Go on.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.958
Bree's into women now?

06:55.958 --> 06:57.751
Which, you know, which is cool.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.961
It's all good. It's good in the hood.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.379
Ain't no thing.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.297
You really need to hang out
with more Black people.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.466
That's fair. I'm just stunned.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.135
This is so not like Bree.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.806
- But it is very Timberly.
- What do you mean?

07:10.806 --> 07:13.642
They used to call her "Sin-berly"
on <i>Fuck Buddy Mountain.</i>

07:13.642 --> 07:16.520
Men, women, that chick is
up and down for anything.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.273
Wait, are you watching
that stupid reality show?

07:19.273 --> 07:21.692
Well you can't imagine
how badass these women are.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.694
Like when Tawny crashed her snowmobile

07:23.694 --> 07:26.446
and had to walk three miles
in high heels and a teddy,

07:26.446 --> 07:28.490
only to find Kim in bed with Brody,

07:28.490 --> 07:30.117
who I knew was trouble.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.869
Guys, we're way behind.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.538
And you know how cranky Jerry gets
when he's not home by 2:00 PM.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.956
Okay. All right.
Okay. Let's go!

07:35.956 --> 07:37.875
Hey, don't tell anyone.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.334
We're on a TV set.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.171
You think Bree scissoring Timberly
isn't going to get around?

07:42.629 --> 07:43.714
Just...

07:48.760 --> 07:51.638
Wait, wait. I'm confused.
What is scissoring?

07:52.514 --> 07:55.017
It's when two women spread their legs,

07:55.017 --> 07:57.769
a la scissors, and I don't wanna be crass,

07:57.769 --> 07:59.980
but they rub their pussies together.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.815
- Okay.
- This from a woman who was

08:01.815 --> 08:03.525
just showing us pictures of her grandson.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.195
- You can't put me in a box.
- Not for another year or so.

08:06.195 --> 08:08.405
- Where were these jokes yesterday?

08:08.405 --> 08:10.574
Instead of the 50 pitches on oat milk.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.618
For the record, scissoring is bullshit.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.786
It is a fantasy of lesbian sex

08:14.786 --> 08:17.497
that exists primarily in porn
made for hetero men.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.124
Why do you have to ruin everything?

08:19.124 --> 08:22.377
Why am I having such a hard time
picturing this scissors thing?

08:22.377 --> 08:24.379
The whole thing is quite
simple, actually, okay?

08:24.379 --> 08:27.216
You have two women,
in this case are Bree and Timberly,

08:27.216 --> 08:30.177
and they lie up on a bed
or perhaps a beach towel

08:30.177 --> 08:32.429
with their legs spread akimbo.

08:32.429 --> 08:35.557
And then they gingerly
press each other's loins together--

08:35.557 --> 08:38.810
Oh god, why does Alan
get to say things like that,

08:38.810 --> 08:40.938
but I get yelled at
for ordering two soups?

08:40.938 --> 08:42.439
Yeah. Let's, let's get back to work.

08:42.439 --> 08:45.234
Yeah, yeah. But right after
Alan tells the story about

08:45.234 --> 08:48.654
the time he got the blowjob
from Paul Lynde in his Hollywood square.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.280
- Shut up.
- It was the '70s.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.823
I had taken a Quaalude.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.450
Oh my God, Paul Lynde is a daddy.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.576
What was he like?

08:54.576 --> 08:56.537
The man had a jaw like a python.

08:56.537 --> 09:00.541
Okay. Let's just stop
prying into each other's sex lives.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.084
That's half the reason I come to work.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.169
How about you, two soups?

09:04.169 --> 09:05.796
Who you bringing the clam chowder home to?

09:05.796 --> 09:08.382
Two soups.
Is that my nickname now?

09:09.299 --> 09:11.844
Hannah looks uncomfortable.
Let's talk about her.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.429
No, we're not gonna do that.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.681
You know what? Hannah's right.

09:15.681 --> 09:16.849
Let's get serious. We got at least

09:16.849 --> 09:18.976
three pages to cut out of this script.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.019
And what do we use to cut things.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.063
Scissors.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.314
Came up again naturally.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.816
Yep
I'll tell you a story.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.317
Goldie Hawn,
this is before she was famous.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.027
Ugh, not the Goldie Hawn story.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.574
I got all sorts of crazy stories.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.743
One of my fellow jurors on
<i>12 Angry Boys</i> faked a seizure

09:36.743 --> 09:38.954
so he could get to his
sister's bowling party.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.540
Wow.
People in Hollywood

09:41.540 --> 09:44.042
are so much more dramatic
than I'm used to.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.461
In Silicon Valley, a coder is
considered high maintenance

09:46.461 --> 09:48.338
if they ask for a standing desk.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.716
I want one.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.509
I've only ever used a sitting desk.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.888
Well, this has been fun,

09:55.888 --> 09:58.849
but I gotta get back to the office.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.935
You're not gonna come hang out on set
before the run-through?

10:01.935 --> 10:05.022
No, I have to read an outline
and try to get through these emails.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.150
Your job doesn't sound as fun as mine.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.987
Have you ever seen any of
the cool things on the lot?

10:12.529 --> 10:14.615
Come on. I'm giving you a tour.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.742
No, no, no.
I gotta get back to the office.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.995
- But your phone's going on a tour.
- Hey!

10:23.916 --> 10:26.168
Oh, Whitney, come on.
You're a member of the family now.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.253
You can ask me for anything,

10:28.253 --> 10:30.047
except for my red Valentino's.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.548
I'm getting buried in those.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.676
The only thing I want
is to be your friend.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.552
Come here.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.014
Ooh. I'm liking in this scene today

10:39.014 --> 10:40.891
way more than I did yesterday.

10:40.891 --> 10:42.684
A very nice tender moment.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.269
Bygones are now bygones.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.604
And we're out.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.941
Hey, so Jerry, would Bree's buried line

10:48.941 --> 10:51.777
be funnier if I made a joke
about wanting the Valentino's?

10:51.777 --> 10:53.946
Ooh!
- Bree got a laugh on it.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.364
I think she'd get a bigger one.
Let's do it.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.281
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.616
Okay. Let's go again.

10:57.616 --> 10:58.617
I don't give a shit.

10:59.535 --> 11:00.869
Did you see that?

11:00.869 --> 11:03.455
Since when is Bree giving away jokes?

11:03.455 --> 11:05.666
It's just like what happened on
<i>Fuck Buddy Mountain.</i>

11:05.666 --> 11:06.959
What are you talking about?

11:06.959 --> 11:09.127
There was this super sweet girl,
Sarah R,

11:09.127 --> 11:10.921
who you just couldn't help but love.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.965
But Timberly saw her as a threat.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.467
So, what does she do?
She seduces her.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.720
And Sarah R being the naive Iowa farm girl

11:18.720 --> 11:20.389
let her guard down and then bam.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.890
Bam. What do you mean, bam?

11:21.890 --> 11:24.101
She gave Timberly her immunity thong.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.435
- Her immunity thong?
- Yeah.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.938
And then the naked council
sent her into sex-ile.

11:27.938 --> 11:30.190
- Into sex-ile?
- Yes.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.193
You don't think that's why
Timberly had sex with Bree?

11:33.193 --> 11:36.113
I don't know, but I'm
on the edge of my seat.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.073
Oh, they're hugging again.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.659
And that's it, we're out.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.495
Bye-bye.
- See you, Jer.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.913
It was funnier, right?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.832
- Much better. Funnier.
- Oh, fantastic.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.417
It's funny.
- Mm-hm.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.503
Hi!

11:51.503 --> 11:53.172
Should we keep pitching on the tag

11:53.172 --> 11:55.048
or start to blue sky the next episode?

11:55.757 --> 11:56.758
Huh?

11:57.551 --> 11:58.802
You okay?

11:58.802 --> 12:00.679
Yeah. I, um...

12:06.768 --> 12:08.437
There's all that sex talk in there,

12:08.437 --> 12:10.898
and we were laughing, and then it hit me.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.193
My dad doesn't know.
- Doesn't know what?

12:14.193 --> 12:16.069
He clearly knows a lot
more about sex than Bob.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.905
No, he doesn't know about me.

12:17.905 --> 12:21.575
You know, that...
that I'm a lesbian.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.244
No one says lesbian anymore,
Billie Jean King.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.454
Anyway, I just, I don't know.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.122
I feel like I have to
come out all over again.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.082
And it's like I thought
I was done with this shit.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.126
I'm, you know, 30-ish years old.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.794
That ish is doing a lot of work.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.630
Hmm. At least my bones are strong

12:34.630 --> 12:36.673
from having grown up
drinking real fucking milk.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.176
I don't understand.
Why didn't you just come out to him?

12:39.176 --> 12:41.845
It's not like he was around
when I came out to my mom.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.722
And I wasn't gonna knock
on his door and be like,

12:43.722 --> 12:45.891
"Happy Thanksgiving.
Hope you're having fun

12:45.891 --> 12:46.975
"with the family you left me for.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.061
By the way, I like sex with women."

12:49.061 --> 12:50.979
Why don't you just do it now?
Get it over with.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.400
You're right. You're right.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.527
Thank you.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.403
I don't why I'm so nervous about this.

12:59.530 --> 13:01.281
Although, is it
inappropriate to do at work?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.325
Oh, did you not just attend scissorfest?

13:03.325 --> 13:04.493
Right.
Yeah.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.960
Hey, um, you busy?

13:12.960 --> 13:15.462
Huh? I got a hankering for something.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.339
I don't know what it is, but something.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.758
Yeah. Yeah. Mind if I talk
to you for a second?

13:19.758 --> 13:21.385
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

13:21.385 --> 13:25.097
So today it occurred to me that you--

13:25.097 --> 13:27.891
Oh, my God. When was the last time
anybody cleaned out this place?

13:27.891 --> 13:29.226

Uh, never mind. Sorry.

talk to you about Timberly.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.686
What about Timberly?

16:18.270 --> 16:20.647
Well, we know that
she is the one with whom

16:20.647 --> 16:22.524
you had sex last night.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.651
I'm not giving you any details.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.279
- That is not why we're here.
- Although--

16:27.279 --> 16:29.948
We are here as friends.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.701
First of all, if you are a lesbian,

16:32.701 --> 16:33.994
we are here to support you.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.298
can you please tell Bree
about "Sin-berly"?

16:46.298 --> 16:47.883
What?

16:47.883 --> 16:50.344
It was episode eight
of <i>Fuck Buddy Mountain</i>,

16:50.344 --> 16:52.012
- "Cucks Versus Sluts."
- "Cucks Versus Sluts."

16:52.012 --> 16:54.431
And Timberly's alliance
was really falling apart.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.099
- Falling apart, into shreds.
- Oh, wait,

16:56.099 --> 16:57.142
I should go back and tell you about

16:57.142 --> 16:58.727
when the Conway sister showed up.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.355
No, no, no.
The point is, ahem,

17:01.355 --> 17:04.191
we suspect Timberly sees you as a threat,

17:04.191 --> 17:06.652
and is using sex to neutralize you

17:06.652 --> 17:08.028
like she did on the show.

17:13.534 --> 17:14.910

17:16.495 --> 17:18.497
She is a reality star.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.415
She didn't come here to make friends.

17:22.835 --> 17:25.128
My God, but it seemed so real.

17:25.128 --> 17:28.340

manipulating me this whole time?

17:28.340 --> 17:29.591

20:37.154 --> 20:39.448
You openly did cocaine at work?

20:39.448 --> 20:41.116
Oh yeah, we used to
send the PA to pick it up.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.243
I wonder whatever happened to him.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.412
I think he's running Columbia TriStar.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.999
So, how'd it go with your dad?

20:49.625 --> 20:51.543
I didn't tell him. Don't shame me.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.921
Honey, you are a fierce,
grown-ass woman.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.547
What the hell is happening?

20:55.547 --> 20:58.550
Why, why do I need to be the one
that keeps sharing shit?

20:58.550 --> 21:00.135
Huh? I don't have anything to prove.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.845
I don't have to impress him.

21:01.845 --> 21:02.846
Why do I have to come out?

21:03.555 --> 21:05.766
He should be the one to come in.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.476
Okay. Now you're spiraling, boo.

21:07.476 --> 21:09.811
Oh my God. Stop lecturing me.
You haven't come out to your dad.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.355
Okay. It's hardly the same thing.

21:11.355 --> 21:13.524
Your dad's friend got
a blowjob from Paul Lynde.

21:13.524 --> 21:16.527
Back in our town,
my dad tried to ban dancing.

21:19.947 --> 21:21.198
Oh.

21:21.907 --> 21:23.325
And we're back.

21:23.325 --> 21:26.078
Woo-woo! That was awesome.

21:26.078 --> 21:30.207
Oh, thanks for making
my first actor meeting so easy.

21:30.207 --> 21:32.626
Same. First business meeting.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.254
You're really fun.

21:35.254 --> 21:37.214
Did you just call me fun?

21:37.214 --> 21:40.425
I don't think I've ever
been called fun before.

21:40.425 --> 21:43.011
:
Well, you definitely are, milady.

21:43.011 --> 21:46.056
:
Oh, why thank you, my lord.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.477
Hey, that's my fucking bike.

21:50.853 --> 21:52.604
Oh, it's okay. I'm an actor.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.189
Nah, I'ma tase your ass.

21:54.189 --> 21:55.274
Sorry!

22:00.404 --> 22:02.239
Whatever happened to Bugles?

22:02.239 --> 22:03.907
We used to have bowls of them.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.078
Hey. Hi, um--

22:08.078 --> 22:09.997
You old enough to remember Bugles?

22:10.622 --> 22:13.125
Yeah, you put them on like witch nails.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.502
Yes! Can we get some of those, please?

22:15.502 --> 22:17.296
Anyway, um...

22:19.089 --> 22:20.924
Have you ever seen the movie <i>Footloose</i>?

22:20.924 --> 22:24.011
That the one with the girl
dancing in the Catskills.

22:24.011 --> 22:25.220
Hates Jerry Orbach?

22:25.220 --> 22:27.055
No, that's <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

22:27.055 --> 22:28.390
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Never cared for that one.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.808
A little too Jew-y.

22:29.808 --> 22:31.268
Okay. Just forget I brought that up.

22:31.268 --> 22:33.312
That's not what I wanted to say.
What I wanted to say--

22:33.312 --> 22:35.522
Okay, everyone,
time for run-through.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.899
All right. Thank you, Dennis.

22:36.899 --> 22:38.233
- Yeah.
- This movie talk, can we,

22:38.233 --> 22:40.194
do we have to do it now,
or can wait till after?

22:40.194 --> 22:41.236
Just forget--
Forget it. Not important.

22:41.236 --> 22:42.487
Forget it.
- All right.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.031
Carrot, got a carrot.
- Okay.

22:44.031 --> 22:45.199
Fuckin' Dennis.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.166
- Yes, we're still seeing that bullshit.
- Hey!

22:54.166 --> 22:55.209
Hey!
- Are you two--

22:55.209 --> 22:57.127
What, darling?
- You made me look

22:57.127 --> 22:58.712
like an idiot.
- The fuck we do?

22:58.712 --> 22:59.922
You got in my head.

22:59.922 --> 23:02.925
So, like an idiot,
I go and I accuse Timberly

23:02.925 --> 23:05.761
of all the things that you said
that she did on her reality show.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.971
And, guess what?
Scripted!

23:07.971 --> 23:08.972
- What?
- Yeah.

23:08.972 --> 23:10.015
Every major plot point.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.517
- No way.
- Yeah.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.435
She brought out the outline

23:13.435 --> 23:15.395
of the episode where
she sleeps with Sarah R,

23:15.395 --> 23:18.315
and then she showed me pictures
of her at Sarah R's wedding.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.816
- Shut the fuck up.
- I will not.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.568
- The honey trampoline?
- That is fake.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.945
Timberly and the snowmobile?

23:22.945 --> 23:24.655
- Fake.
- Kim banging Brody?

23:24.655 --> 23:26.490
- Fake.
- The beaver hunt.

23:26.490 --> 23:27.574
Fake.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.493
I feel so manipulated.

23:29.493 --> 23:31.620
How do you think I feel? You idiots.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.581
Okay, here we go.
And action.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.707
That's my cue.

23:38.836 --> 23:40.003
Hey, Cody.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.713
Hello, Whitney.

23:42.130 --> 23:44.508
Hey guys.
Can I ask you a question?

23:44.508 --> 23:46.301
Sure, buddy. Shoot.

23:46.301 --> 23:48.303
My boss at work is
really getting on my case,

23:48.303 --> 23:49.680
and I'm not sure what to do.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.849
- What's his name?
- Janet.

23:51.849 --> 23:53.183
Ah.

23:53.183 --> 23:56.311
I was just trying to make sure
no one was taking advantage of you.

23:56.311 --> 23:57.646
You can't do this shit anymore.

23:57.646 --> 23:58.689
We're not a couple.

23:58.689 --> 23:59.940
You're not my protector.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.650
You're right. I'm sorry.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.654
It's, it's just hard for me
to not care about you.

24:06.196 --> 24:08.574
I'm a different person
than I was 15 years ago.

24:08.574 --> 24:10.534
I've been through a lot.

24:10.534 --> 24:11.827
And it's made me stronger.

24:11.827 --> 24:13.412
And for the first time in my life,

24:13.412 --> 24:15.873
I am taking care of myself
without anyone's help,

24:15.873 --> 24:17.499
even if it means that I fall on my face.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.793
But I am not going to,
because I am focused,

24:19.793 --> 24:21.503
I am on top of things--

24:21.503 --> 24:23.005
Bree, you missed your cue.

24:23.005 --> 24:25.174
Shit. This is your fault.

24:25.174 --> 24:26.592
I'm sorry, Jer! I'm sorry!

24:26.592 --> 24:27.551
I didn't hear it.

24:27.551 --> 24:29.511
I didn't hear you.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.305
Should I back it up
or should I just come out?

24:31.305 --> 24:34.183
- What?
- Do you want me to come out now?

24:34.183 --> 24:35.350
Just come out.

24:35.350 --> 24:36.977
Okay. Fine. I'm a lesbian.

24:39.396 --> 24:41.440
I'm sorry. I'm a...

24:41.440 --> 24:43.525
I should have said this earlier. And...

24:44.693 --> 24:48.238
Look, I have no idea
why this has been so hard for me to do,

24:48.238 --> 24:50.991
because I spent my entire life
not needing your approval,

24:50.991 --> 24:52.534
and I still don't need your approval.

24:52.534 --> 24:53.702
Mm...

24:53.702 --> 24:58.373
But you're my...
you're my parent.

24:59.082 --> 25:01.001
So you should know.

25:01.001 --> 25:02.669
And I want you to know.

25:04.463 --> 25:05.380
Honey.

25:06.340 --> 25:07.299
I know.

25:09.134 --> 25:11.887
- Wait, you do.
- Yes.

25:11.887 --> 25:13.597
I mean, ever since you were little.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.349
I didn't know, but I knew.

25:15.849 --> 25:18.477
Plus, dummy, when your film came out,

25:18.477 --> 25:19.686
you went on all those interviews

25:19.686 --> 25:21.480
called yourself a queer filmmaker.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.526
Wait, you read, like,
the press and interviews?

25:25.943 --> 25:27.194
Yes.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.154
What? I can't be proud from a distance?

25:29.863 --> 25:30.864
Everyone!

25:33.700 --> 25:35.536
I was also gay last night.

25:36.245 --> 25:37.746
Oh.
That's right.

25:37.746 --> 25:39.540
I'm a sexual fluid

25:39.540 --> 25:41.625
and there is nothing wrong with that.
