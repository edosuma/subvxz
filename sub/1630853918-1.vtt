00:21.313 --> 00:22.606
I didn't want to go trick-or-treating

00:22.690 --> 00:24.442
'cause I thought
I was too old to dress up.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.776
Hey, baby, you up?

00:25.860 --> 00:27.528
The thing is, got a weakness

00:28.154 --> 00:30.656
for those little bite-size
3 Musketeers bars.

00:30.740 --> 00:31.866

00:33.617 --> 00:36.370
Oh, man.
We've been over this, boss.

00:36.454 --> 00:38.164
I have every right
to use the plumbing

00:38.247 --> 00:39.874
to cultivate a romantic relationship

00:39.957 --> 00:41.751
with the female inmate on the third floor.

00:41.834 --> 00:42.918
That's not why I'm here.

Jack, papi, are you there?

00:44.754 --> 00:45.755
Yeah, baby.

00:45.838 --> 00:49.884
[woman] I got the picture you sent.
You got a handsome dick!

00:51.051 --> 00:53.429
Gloria, I'm gonna have to call you back.
We have company.

00:53.512 --> 00:56.182
If you're trying to take my bug,
then we might be throwing hands.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.976
Me and this little guy
have gotten very attached.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.521
He's the only one polite enough
to listen to my stories.

01:02.605 --> 01:04.648
I don't give a shit
about your bug, Rooster.

01:04.732 --> 01:08.402
You can put a vest on it
and take it on a plane, for all I care.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.904
You're both getting out today.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.739
Him and the bug are getting out?

01:11.822 --> 01:13.616
Not the bug. You and him.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.035
The bug has been free to leave
whenever he wants.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.870
Bullshit.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.164
I still got eight months.
This fool got four years left.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.833
Governor's lettin' out a bunch
of nonviolent inmates

01:22.917 --> 01:24.251
because of the coronavirus,

01:24.335 --> 01:26.045
and you dumbasses are two of them.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.046
Grab your stuff.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.173
What the hell is coronavirus?

01:29.256 --> 01:30.674
Beats the shit out of me.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.470
Thanks for always being there, Nelson.

Weh-hell, this is crazy, huh?

01:46.774 --> 01:48.692
If you'd a-told me this morning
that I was gonna--

01:48.776 --> 01:50.945
Here's $40 and your personal belongings.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.863
The clothes you came in with
are down the hall.

01:52.947 --> 01:56.033
If you've been here longer than 10 years,
we apologize for the moth problem,

01:56.116 --> 01:58.494
which has since been rectified. Next!

01:58.577 --> 02:00.955
What exactly
is this coronavirus, anyway?

02:01.038 --> 02:03.249
A couple weeks ago,
some dumbass ate a rotten bat.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.293
Now people are dying from the flu,
and they shut down the NBA.

02:06.377 --> 02:07.878
Mnh. Next!

02:10.840 --> 02:12.550
Hey, yo, what up, Shelley?

02:12.633 --> 02:15.177
They're lettin' you out?
When you come back next week,

02:15.261 --> 02:16.720
don't bring the coronavirus.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.473
Not gonna happen.
I ain't eatin' no bat.

Okay, this is it, folks.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.120
You're all free to go,
but please keep in mind,

02:41.203 --> 02:43.873
the state has issued
a shelter-in-place order.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.916
What's a shelter-in-place order?

02:46.917 --> 02:50.713
Unless you are essential--
which I assure you, you are not--

02:50.796 --> 02:52.298
you need to stay in your home.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.509
But we've been in prison.
We don't have a home.

02:55.593 --> 02:57.303
I agree, it's a bit of a head-scratcher,

02:57.386 --> 03:00.890
but we were just told to let you go,
so that's what we did.

03:01.891 --> 03:02.892
Good luck.

What, no? No,
I can't stay with my boyfriend

03:16.405 --> 03:18.324
because he is still in prison.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.117
Besides, we're not that serious.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.828
We talk through the toilet,
and I've only seen a picture of his dick.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.958
Yeah. No, I know.

into my personal life all of a sudden.

How 'bout you?

04:07.623 --> 04:10.167
Well, I attempted to call my parents.

It's been so long since we talked,
I forgot their number.

04:13.879 --> 04:16.465
I just tried dialing,
hoping muscle memory would kick in.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.468
Ended up calling a Walgreens.

Chatted with the pharmacist for a spell.

the world is upside down right now.

Grocery stores are stripped bare.
Restaurants are closed.

or you have PTSD or something.

minimum drug sentences.

-You got a lot of catching up to do.

like you got a lot of options.

I need toilet paper. You can't
buy any in the stores anymore.

for stealing toilet paper.

All right, let me give you the tour.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.554
This is the kitchen.
Dinner's usually around seven.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.556
Do either of you have any allergies

10:39.639 --> 10:43.310
or things that you're intolerant of,
such as gluten or dairy?

10:43.393 --> 10:45.062
I'm not a huge fan of mayo.

10:45.145 --> 10:49.274
Well, my condolences,
as that's a staple here.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.567
[whispers]
What's a gluten?

10:50.650 --> 10:53.153
TV gets most of the local channels,

10:53.236 --> 10:56.198
but if you're somebody
who just can't live without CBS,

10:56.281 --> 10:57.407
then you gotta get the ladder to

10:57.491 --> 11:00.786
climb onto the roof to point
the antenna towards the water tower.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.412

Yeah, I got my dad's looks
and my mother's thirst for adventure.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.552
It's a pretty good one-two punch.

This is Rooster's bedroom.

long enough to redecorate.

Hey, what happened to
my Dora the Explorer drapes?

11:35.529 --> 11:39.324
Did you not hear what I said
about the toilet paper shortage?

11:39.408 --> 11:43.453
This is my bedroom which brings me
to the most important house rule.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.831
Don't come in here
looking to slip a cock in me.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.707
I'm in a committed relationship

11:47.791 --> 11:49.042
with someone I met online,

11:49.126 --> 11:53.547
and I am for once in my life
trying to remain faithful.

11:53.630 --> 11:57.259
The problem is
I have a weakness for bad boys.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.469
I sometimes get lonely.

11:59.553 --> 12:03.598
I will on occasion treat myself
to half a box of chardonnay.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.852
