00:15.206 --> 00:16.195
Hey, babe.

00:16.197 --> 00:18.531
Hey, did you get him down okay?

00:18.533 --> 00:21.433
Yep, ten minutes of crying
and complete submission.

00:21.435 --> 00:23.802
Good, because I am in the mood for...

00:23.804 --> 00:26.304
<i>I ate all the pizza.</i>

00:26.306 --> 00:27.906
Not what I was gonna say.

Oh?

00:32.579 --> 00:33.845
Oh!

00:33.847 --> 00:35.313
Mm-hmm.

00:35.315 --> 00:37.248
How long till you're home?

00:37.250 --> 00:40.017
[laughs] Ten minutes?

00:40.019 --> 00:41.919
Love you.

00:41.921 --> 00:43.353

Hey, Charlie.

[sighs]

01:18.713 --> 01:20.054
Kristine, what are you doing here?

01:21.261 --> 01:24.292
I brought you a bottle of Kentucky's best,

01:24.294 --> 01:26.962
but I kind of got into it already.

01:26.964 --> 01:31.123
[inhales sharply]

01:31.173 --> 01:33.829
I don't feel so good.

01:35.462 --> 01:37.249
Come inside.

01:44.947 --> 01:48.015
Alex is gonna be home very soon.

01:48.623 --> 01:50.784
Well, lucky you.

01:54.830 --> 01:56.589
Kris, you can't be here.

01:59.127 --> 02:01.194
If you want to talk, we can talk at work.

02:05.699 --> 02:08.734
Well, you've been avoiding me
like the plague.

02:11.104 --> 02:15.058
You can't disappear like that
on me, Charlie.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.241
I need you.

02:18.291 --> 02:19.516
Just...

02:19.566 --> 02:23.947
I'm gonna call you a cab, okay?

02:23.950 --> 02:27.585
And then tomorrow, when you sober up,

02:27.587 --> 02:33.058
and you're feeling the regret of
this evening and a headache,

02:33.060 --> 02:34.959
we can talk.

So, we are booked for Saturday morning?

02:57.694 --> 02:59.782
Can't we just go to brunch?

02:59.784 --> 03:01.050
We could take a walk in high park,

03:01.052 --> 03:02.284
play "which dog would you steal?"

03:02.286 --> 03:03.686
Yeah, we do that every weekend, though.

03:03.688 --> 03:05.788
Let's try something new, something bold.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.423
Something that could lead to
massive lacerations

03:07.425 --> 03:09.425
or amputation?

03:09.427 --> 03:11.526
So, you don't want to go axe throwing?

03:11.528 --> 03:14.062
No, I want to eat chicken
and waffles with you, okay?

03:14.064 --> 03:15.430
Last week, it was paintball.

03:15.432 --> 03:18.066
This week, it's axe throwing?

03:18.068 --> 03:20.268
[laughs] Are you having
a quarter-life crisis?

03:20.270 --> 03:22.070
I'm just trying to shake things up.

03:22.072 --> 03:23.872
Well, stop. There's no need to shake.

03:23.874 --> 03:25.406
I like things the way they are.

03:25.408 --> 03:27.075
Doogie. Dr. Williams.

03:27.077 --> 03:29.110
- Dr. Bishop.
- Morning.

03:32.848 --> 03:34.749
What?

03:34.751 --> 03:36.516
I should get going.

03:36.518 --> 03:39.754
Don't wanna be late for rounds.

03:39.756 --> 03:43.390
It's kombucha, japanese fermented tea.

03:43.392 --> 03:45.158
The slimy chunks are bacteria

03:45.160 --> 03:47.460
that are supposed to stimulate
the immune system.

03:47.462 --> 03:50.396
Uh-huh. Any, uh... any science behind that?

03:50.398 --> 03:52.832
Nah, didn't think so.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.567
[laughs] Listen, I'm just trying to help.

03:54.569 --> 03:56.636
- Hmm.
- What is all that?

03:56.638 --> 03:59.572
Oh, estate planning.

03:59.574 --> 04:02.607
I'm just trying to figure out
how to make sure Molly

04:02.609 --> 04:06.078
doesn't blow through her trust
fund after I'm gone, you know?

04:06.080 --> 04:08.080
I wish there was a way

04:08.082 --> 04:11.683
that I could come back and check
on her every couple years.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.019
Dana? You're still here.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.488
Yeah. No, it's...

04:16.490 --> 04:19.523
And if the time comes,
I'll be there for her,

04:19.524 --> 04:21.125
whatever she needs.

04:21.127 --> 04:24.295
Thank you, darling.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.898
I mean, I know this is self-evident,

04:26.900 --> 04:28.866
but dying really sucks.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.202
[phone buzzes]

04:31.204 --> 04:34.071
Whoa, trauma, MVA on our doorstep.

04:34.073 --> 04:36.273
- Go, go, go.
- Drink it!

04:36.275 --> 04:40.343
Mm, can't wait.

04:40.345 --> 04:41.912
[siren wails]

04:41.914 --> 04:44.314
Got a 35-year-old woman,
drunk driver, car versus tree.

04:44.316 --> 04:46.382
B.P. is 160 over 90.

04:46.384 --> 04:49.652
I need two large bore IV's, an
arterial line, and a catheter.

04:49.654 --> 04:53.355
On three. One, two, three!

04:53.357 --> 04:56.391
Let's go.

04:56.393 --> 04:57.960
Airway is clear.

04:57.962 --> 04:59.695
Chest expanding normally
on both sides. Cassie?

04:59.697 --> 05:01.463
Bilateral lung sounds are normal.

05:01.465 --> 05:02.965
Okay, I want you to follow this pen.

05:02.967 --> 05:06.235
Good pupil response. Visual acuity is good.

05:06.237 --> 05:08.270
Okay, let's get her cleaned up
and ready to move.

05:08.272 --> 05:11.372
Excuse me? Besides the alcohol,
was she on anything else?

05:11.374 --> 05:13.041
Not that we've found on the scene,

05:13.043 --> 05:14.943
but I bagged her personals just in case.

05:14.945 --> 05:18.646
Wait a minute. Let me see that.

05:18.932 --> 05:21.015
Her I.D. says she's a nurse here?

05:21.017 --> 05:23.417
Kristine Fields.

05:23.419 --> 05:26.187
Yeah, I know who she is.

05:38.577 --> 05:40.692
Let's check the chest
and abdominal injuries first.

05:40.694 --> 05:45.163
Her spine felt fine. I need
cervical imaging, as well.

05:46.165 --> 05:50.700
Oh, thank you. Yes, Dr. Sekara.

05:51.172 --> 05:53.733
Aren't you forgetting something?

05:54.767 --> 05:56.380
My latte.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.328
Oh, shoot. I forgot.

05:58.378 --> 06:01.144
Well, despite your insolence,
I have a present for you.

06:01.146 --> 06:04.386
Carmen Basilone, 26, male.
Actually,

06:05.456 --> 06:07.588
I don't want to spoil it.

06:08.386 --> 06:09.918
Ooh.

06:10.695 --> 06:14.212
I might look bad, but I feel great.

06:14.262 --> 06:15.516
He's on a boat load of meperidine.

06:15.566 --> 06:17.799
Dr. Sekara here is going to get
you some antibiotics

06:17.849 --> 06:18.727
and a tetanus shot.

06:19.739 --> 06:21.568
Can you tell me how this happened?

06:21.618 --> 06:22.930
Construction job.

06:22.932 --> 06:26.754
I was reinforcing the floor, and I did this,

06:27.127 --> 06:28.951
and that made me drop the nail gun,

06:29.001 --> 06:31.420
and a nail just came shooting up,

06:31.470 --> 06:37.401
so I covered my face because,
like, "oh, crap, nail."

06:37.451 --> 06:41.482
You may feel some numbness or
radiating pain in your arm.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.684
Oh, I haven't been able to feel
anything for a while now.

06:45.096 --> 06:47.074
You mean figuratively or literally?

06:47.779 --> 06:49.150
No.

06:50.533 --> 06:51.754
In here.

06:51.833 --> 06:55.361
Just... not since she broke up with me.

06:55.363 --> 06:57.396
Okay, I'm gonna go page ortho.

06:57.398 --> 07:00.333
[sighs]

07:00.335 --> 07:01.767
All righty, then, yeah.

07:01.769 --> 07:04.103
Let's get you up for some X-rays.

07:10.643 --> 07:12.310
There's a cheetah-print piece of lace

07:12.312 --> 07:14.444
coming out your right pant leg.

07:15.015 --> 07:17.115
How does that even happen?

07:17.117 --> 07:18.650
These are yesterday's scrubs,

07:18.652 --> 07:20.781
and this is yesterday's underwear.

07:21.098 --> 07:22.521
You ever think about taking
that show on the road?

07:22.523 --> 07:25.123
Guys up in geriatrics would love that trick.

07:25.125 --> 07:27.924
I have been on call all week.
I haven't had sex in six months,

07:27.926 --> 07:30.494
and I was in an explosion less
than two months ago,

07:30.496 --> 07:32.663
so just give me a break, okay?

07:32.665 --> 07:34.331
- [phone buzzes]
- E.R.

07:34.333 --> 07:35.799
I'll walk with you.

07:38.069 --> 07:39.770
[monitors beeping] Hey.

07:39.772 --> 07:43.274
Dr. Button nose, Dr. Cheekbones,
this is Lois.

07:43.276 --> 07:45.341
B.P. is on the high end. Pulse is 110.

07:45.343 --> 07:46.643
She's febrile.

07:46.645 --> 07:47.743
- Okay.
- Dr. Lin.

07:47.745 --> 07:49.912
Lois, I did your gastric bypass, right?

07:49.914 --> 07:52.148
Nine months ago, yes.

07:52.150 --> 07:53.650
[panting]

07:53.652 --> 07:55.251
I think I'm having a heart attack.

07:55.253 --> 07:56.653
Her co-worker called an ambulance.

07:56.655 --> 07:58.254
Okay, well, better safe than sorry.

07:58.256 --> 08:01.890
With us lawyers, it's more like
better safe than liable.

08:01.892 --> 08:04.226
Godspeed.

08:04.228 --> 08:06.295
Lois, do you have any numbness
or tingling your arms?

08:06.297 --> 08:08.763
Lightheadedness? Pain in your jaw?

08:08.765 --> 08:11.433
No. It's just my chest.

08:11.435 --> 08:14.869
It's tight, and there's a burning sensation.

08:14.871 --> 08:16.037
Okay.

08:16.039 --> 08:18.239
I had my stomach stapled because
you warned me

08:18.241 --> 08:19.373
I'd have heart problems

08:19.375 --> 08:21.342
if I didn't get my weight under control.

08:21.344 --> 08:23.010
Now I'm having a heart attack.

08:23.012 --> 08:25.045
- We don't know that yet, Lois.
- Are you on any medications?

08:26.237 --> 08:28.182
I took some anti-malaria pills

08:28.184 --> 08:32.986
a few months ago for a trip to
the Dominican, that's all.

08:32.988 --> 08:34.455
Okay, Lois. Well, there's
a little S.T. elevation

08:34.457 --> 08:36.256
in your cardiogram, so why don't
we get you up to the cath lab

08:36.258 --> 08:40.025
- and sort that out?
- I can't catch my breath.

08:40.028 --> 08:41.727
Okay, bag her.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.763
It's okay. You're okay.

08:43.765 --> 08:46.899
I'm getting a lot of resistance.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.401
Okay, should we tube her?

08:48.403 --> 08:50.837
Open up for me, Lois.

08:50.839 --> 08:52.705
She's showing signs of chronic aspiration.

08:52.707 --> 08:54.206
I don't think this is a heart attack.

08:54.208 --> 08:56.007
Okay, let's get her down to an endo suite.

08:56.009 --> 08:58.110
You're gonna be okay, Lois.

08:58.112 --> 09:00.346
All right, camera's on.

09:00.348 --> 09:03.115
Let's see what's going on with miss Lois.

09:03.301 --> 09:07.784
Esophagus looks a bit dilated,
and it is beet red.

09:08.564 --> 09:09.920
Huh.

09:09.922 --> 09:10.988
Good huh, bad huh?

09:10.990 --> 09:12.523
You ever hear a good huh in here before?

09:12.525 --> 09:14.492
That's a good point. What's the issue?

09:14.993 --> 09:16.461
The scope won't budge.

09:16.463 --> 09:18.195
Seems to be a mechanical obstruction.

09:18.197 --> 09:21.399
Could be caused by a twist in
the bowel or...

09:21.401 --> 09:23.768
looks like a blockage of food?

09:23.770 --> 09:26.803
Judging by her size, she hasn't
been following her post-up diet.

09:26.805 --> 09:28.572
She should have lost 50 pounds by now.

09:28.574 --> 09:30.173
My sister had her stomach stapled.

09:30.175 --> 09:32.942
Couldn't eat anything bigger
than the size of a cashew.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.848
If it is a bottleneck in her G.I. tract,

09:38.850 --> 09:40.784
that could definitely be causing the pain.

09:40.786 --> 09:43.153
All right, who's up for
an exploratory laparotomy?

09:43.155 --> 09:47.022
Okay, I will go prep us an O.R.

09:47.024 --> 09:49.224
Well, you must be the luckiest man on earth.

09:49.226 --> 09:51.827
I don't feel lucky.

09:51.829 --> 09:54.129
The... the nail has went through
the soft tissue

09:54.131 --> 09:55.831
in both the hands and the face.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.700
No bone, vessels, or nerves were
compromised.

09:57.702 --> 09:59.034
So, he doesn't have to go to the O.R.?

09:59.036 --> 10:01.770
No. You can take them out right
here with a local.

10:01.772 --> 10:05.273
I've got the perfect tool for the job.

10:05.275 --> 10:06.941
I'll go find it.

10:06.943 --> 10:09.010
Just try and stay calm, Carmen.

10:09.012 --> 10:11.145
Sorry, I don't like tools.

10:11.147 --> 10:13.548
A contractor who's nervous around tools.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.082
- How does that work?
- I'm not a contractor.

10:15.084 --> 10:16.851
I work in a bookstore.

10:16.853 --> 10:19.085
Okay, we're gonna give you some lidocaine

10:19.087 --> 10:21.322
so you don't feel any pain
when we pull those nails.

10:21.324 --> 10:23.123
You know what pain is?

10:23.125 --> 10:25.426
Living without the love of your life

10:25.428 --> 10:26.993
because of a fight over a bath tub.

10:26.995 --> 10:31.031
Yeah. No, I'm more of a shower guy myself.

10:31.033 --> 10:34.900
Now, you're gonna feel a pinch
in three, two, one.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.136
Well, Bianca loves her baths.

10:37.138 --> 10:38.571
Those smelly fizz balls

10:38.573 --> 10:41.073
make the whole room feel like birthday cake.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.710
So, as soon as you guys fix me up,

10:43.712 --> 10:45.611
I'm heading back and finishing that reno.

10:45.613 --> 10:47.913
Look, I'm no expert here,

10:47.915 --> 10:50.450
but you should probably hire
somebody to finish the job.

10:50.452 --> 10:53.151
You're gonna feel another pinch.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.887
No, see, I have to do it myself.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.589
Otherwise, it isn't meaningful.

10:57.591 --> 11:00.124
You're gonna feel one more pinch here.

11:00.126 --> 11:03.995
As soon as she sees those slate
floors and the skylight

11:03.997 --> 11:07.332
and the claw-foot tub it took me
two months to find,

11:07.334 --> 11:10.534
she realizes I did it all
myself, just for her?

11:10.536 --> 11:12.436
[voice slurring]

11:12.438 --> 11:13.871
She must be some woman.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.139
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

11:16.141 --> 11:18.976
I'll go help Dr. Harris
track down that tool.

11:21.813 --> 11:23.146
You feeling much?

11:23.148 --> 11:25.849
- No.
- That's good. Good.

11:25.851 --> 11:31.721
[inhales sharply]

11:31.723 --> 11:33.890
How did I get here?

11:33.892 --> 11:36.459
You were in a car accident.

11:36.461 --> 11:37.960
What's wrong with me?

11:37.962 --> 11:39.262
We're waiting for the C.T. results.

11:39.264 --> 11:40.630
I need to talk to Charlie.

11:40.632 --> 11:44.800
You know who I am, right?

11:44.802 --> 11:48.069
Well, my son's blanket
was found in your car.

11:48.071 --> 11:49.872
How did it get there?

11:49.874 --> 11:51.673
[groans]

11:51.675 --> 11:53.642
I need some saline in here!

11:53.644 --> 11:55.811
It's not gonna help. She has a
massive hematoma in her liver.

11:55.813 --> 11:57.546
Not to mention the tibial fracture.

11:57.548 --> 11:58.781
All right, help me unhook her.

11:58.783 --> 12:00.681
We're gonna need to get you to
the O.R., all right?

12:00.683 --> 12:02.316
Please, get Charlie.

12:02.318 --> 12:05.152
I can't do this without him.

12:05.154 --> 12:06.788
Let's go.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.367
Okay, there's a lot more inflammatory tissue

12:15.369 --> 12:16.768
than I thought.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.237
Could be the cause of the blockage.

12:18.239 --> 12:19.838
You seeing what I'm seeing?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.406
Holy kumquat.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.508
You took the words right out of my mouth.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.276
Why would there be an abscess

12:25.278 --> 12:27.378
at the side of the jejunojejunostomy?

12:27.380 --> 12:30.215
Because saying jejunojejunostomy
is just so much fun.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.916
- [laughs]
- All right?

12:31.918 --> 12:33.751
Now we know what caused the blockage.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.587
Would you like to do the honors?

12:35.589 --> 12:37.222
Scalpel.

12:37.224 --> 12:40.351
Remember, breathe through your mouth.

12:41.593 --> 12:43.293
[gurgling]

12:43.295 --> 12:45.462
[both gagging] Oh, that is just...

12:45.464 --> 12:47.464
Oh, that's truly vile.

12:47.466 --> 12:48.412
I can taste it.

12:48.462 --> 12:49.455
"Breathe through your mouth"

12:49.505 --> 12:51.301
might not have been the best advice.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.003
Oh! [clears throat]

12:53.005 --> 12:54.438
Oh!

12:54.440 --> 12:56.472
Okay, Bishop, take a look at this.

12:56.474 --> 13:00.643
There's a leak in the efferent loop.

13:00.645 --> 13:02.345
Is it possible you tied the knot too tightly

13:02.347 --> 13:04.880
when you rerouted the jejunum
during the gastric bypass?

13:04.882 --> 13:06.282
No, I couldn't have.

13:06.284 --> 13:07.850
There are a dozen reasons why
there could be an abscess

13:07.852 --> 13:09.352
in this exact spot.

13:09.354 --> 13:10.719
I'm gonna take it from here.

13:10.721 --> 13:12.254
She's my patient...
if there's something wrong,

13:12.256 --> 13:13.522
I'm gonna fix it.

13:13.524 --> 13:16.491
Not if it's a problem you created.

13:16.493 --> 13:18.160
What is that supposed to mean?

13:18.162 --> 13:20.662
Dr. Lin, put your scalpel down.

13:20.664 --> 13:22.797
[monitor beeping]

13:27.703 --> 13:29.436
I need someone in here to assist.

13:29.438 --> 13:31.805
Page one of the residents for me.

13:48.121 --> 13:49.455
Hey, Molly.

13:49.457 --> 13:53.159
It's, um... it's your mom.

13:53.161 --> 13:55.595
So, uh...

13:55.597 --> 13:59.265
So, I thought I would, um,
record these videos for you

13:59.267 --> 14:02.168
so that, um, I don't know,
you could watch them

14:02.170 --> 14:07.606
after I'm gone, and, um,
hopefully, I can... I can help.

14:07.608 --> 14:11.376
And...

14:11.378 --> 14:13.545
Jesus.

14:13.547 --> 14:18.617
Is that what I look like from this angle?

14:18.619 --> 14:20.418
Um...

14:30.962 --> 14:32.263
Hey, Molly!

14:32.265 --> 14:35.032
It's your dead mother here.

14:35.034 --> 14:38.635
God... [laughs]

14:38.637 --> 14:40.437
We've clamped the IVC above
and below the liver,

14:40.439 --> 14:41.571
but there's still blood coming.

14:41.573 --> 14:43.806
Turn up the suction, please.

14:43.808 --> 14:47.143
Can you help me get a better look?

14:47.145 --> 14:48.578
There it is.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.347
There's a tear in her right hepatic vein

14:50.349 --> 14:53.950
as it enters the cava. 4-0 monofilament.

14:53.952 --> 14:57.219
How's that leg?

14:57.221 --> 14:58.854
Circulation's good.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.022
Okay, once we get her stabilized
and off the blood thinners,

15:01.024 --> 15:03.158
let's get ortho in to fix
that nasty fracture.

15:05.194 --> 15:07.563
And that should do it. Removing the clamps.

15:07.565 --> 15:08.997
[monitor beeping]

15:08.999 --> 15:10.766
No! Back on. Clamps back on.

15:10.768 --> 15:13.067
I need another suction unit, please.

15:13.069 --> 15:15.703
Sponges, keep 'em coming.
Let's go, let's go!

15:15.705 --> 15:17.037
Incoming.

15:17.039 --> 15:21.609
That's not gonna work.

15:21.611 --> 15:23.645
Ready? Gonna have to bail out.

15:23.647 --> 15:27.782
Got you.

15:27.784 --> 15:29.616
More.

15:29.618 --> 15:33.620
Biohazard spill, be careful!

15:33.622 --> 15:36.356
Give me more sponges!

15:36.358 --> 15:38.258
Come on, where are you?

15:38.260 --> 15:41.428
There's another tear.
She blew the left vein, too.

15:41.430 --> 15:43.029
Maybe she has
an underlying condition.

15:43.031 --> 15:44.197
Is she on any medication?

15:44.199 --> 15:45.531
The only thing I know about this
woman is that

15:45.533 --> 15:46.899
she works on the eighth floor.

15:46.901 --> 15:48.301
Maybe we should page Dr. Harris?

15:48.303 --> 15:50.636
No! Call up to palliative.

15:50.638 --> 15:52.772
See if the charge nurse knows
anything about nurse Fields.

15:55.442 --> 15:57.777
Okay. Ready? On three.

15:57.779 --> 15:59.712
- Wait!
- Don't do it on one, okay?

15:59.714 --> 16:01.079
Just don't lie like that.

16:01.081 --> 16:02.480
Actually do it on three.

16:02.482 --> 16:04.649
Okay. One, two...

16:04.651 --> 16:05.917
Never mind, go.

16:05.919 --> 16:07.985
Don't even count, just go.
[inhales sharply]

16:07.987 --> 16:10.789
I think I'm gonna throw up.

16:10.791 --> 16:13.658
Can I even... can I even throw up like this?

16:13.660 --> 16:17.147
Take some deep breaths, Carmen.
Just try and relax.

16:17.662 --> 16:20.464
You know, maybe you could leave
this one in for a week or two,

16:20.466 --> 16:22.065
and I can come back, 'cause honestly,

16:22.067 --> 16:23.400
I can't even feel it anymore.

16:23.402 --> 16:25.168
[monitor beeping]
I think it looks pretty cool.

16:25.170 --> 16:26.837
Dr. Miller?

16:26.839 --> 16:28.572
Yes?

16:28.574 --> 16:30.040
His pulse is elevated, and his
pressure's dropping.

16:30.042 --> 16:31.608
I'd like to give him some benzodiazepine.

16:31.610 --> 16:33.644
[sighs] He's already on
analgesics and narcotics.

16:33.646 --> 16:35.011
It's too risky for his heart.

16:35.013 --> 16:36.813
- Okay.
- Carmen?

16:36.815 --> 16:39.048
Huh? Buddy? Why don't you

16:39.050 --> 16:42.170
tell me a little bit about
this girl of yours.

16:42.220 --> 16:43.685
She sounds amazing.

16:43.687 --> 16:45.554
She was my high-school sweetheart.

16:45.556 --> 16:49.691
You know, it was, like, from
the moment I saw her, even.

16:49.693 --> 16:51.994
You know when-when you're in
a used bookstore,

16:51.996 --> 16:53.695
and you're just digging around,

16:53.697 --> 16:56.331
and you come across a limited edition,

16:56.333 --> 16:59.467
still sealed copy of "The Shadow" from 1932?

16:59.469 --> 17:01.202
Totally.

17:01.204 --> 17:02.803
It's just like that, you know?

17:02.805 --> 17:04.605
Like I won the lottery.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.741
The used book store lottery?

17:06.742 --> 17:08.209
Exactly.

17:08.211 --> 17:09.609
It's worth fighting for, isn't it...

17:09.612 --> 17:11.278
[gasps]

17:11.280 --> 17:13.313
Absolutely.

17:13.315 --> 17:16.282
There you go. We're just gonna
irrigate the wound.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.986
Make sure you don't have
any infections, clean you up,

17:18.988 --> 17:20.420
bandage you up, you'll be good to go.

17:20.422 --> 17:23.022
Then I can finish my reno
and get Bianca back.

17:23.025 --> 17:24.223
You're joking, right?

17:24.226 --> 17:26.559
Come on, man.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.560
No one breaks up over a bathtub.

17:28.561 --> 17:30.363
What are you saying?

17:30.365 --> 17:32.064
You nailed your hand to your
face for a woman

17:32.066 --> 17:33.832
that's probably not even that into you?

17:37.604 --> 17:39.305
How's our patient doing?

17:39.307 --> 17:41.941
Good. He's gonna be out of here in no time.

17:41.943 --> 17:44.377
Dr. Sekara, on the other hand...

17:45.811 --> 17:49.514
I need you.

17:49.516 --> 17:51.349
[monitors beeping]

17:51.351 --> 17:54.685
[sighs] Can you shut those up, please?

17:54.687 --> 17:56.221
[monitors cease beeping]

17:56.223 --> 17:58.089
Damn it, I can't get these sutures to hold.

17:58.091 --> 18:00.158
The charge nurse doesn't know
anything, and nurse Fields

18:00.160 --> 18:02.492
doesn't have an emergency contact on file.

18:02.494 --> 18:04.561
How much longer can we keep
the liver clamped

18:04.563 --> 18:05.896
before it starts to clot?

18:05.898 --> 18:07.864
Ten minutes, tops.

18:07.866 --> 18:10.301
Check her leg.

18:13.405 --> 18:14.704
It's rock hard.

18:14.706 --> 18:16.273
She has compartment syndrome.

18:16.275 --> 18:17.707
I'm scrubbing in.

18:17.709 --> 18:19.375
How did he know that?

18:19.377 --> 18:21.044
Probably from the imaging.

18:21.046 --> 18:22.778
I knew we should have paged Dr. Harris.

18:22.780 --> 18:25.214
I'm gonna step out for a moment.

18:28.419 --> 18:30.553
I want a catheter and U.W. solution ready

18:30.555 --> 18:31.754
for when I get back.

18:31.756 --> 18:33.789
We need to perfuse that liver
to keep it alive.

18:36.059 --> 18:37.592
Hey.

18:37.594 --> 18:38.927
Why didn't you tell me she was in our house?

18:38.929 --> 18:41.563
[sighs] I tried.

18:41.565 --> 18:42.965
She stole Luke's blanket...

18:42.967 --> 18:44.967
the one we couldn't find last night.

18:44.969 --> 18:47.569
Why would she do that?

18:47.571 --> 18:50.939
You tell me.

18:50.941 --> 18:52.407
Kristine and I aren't friends anymore.

18:52.409 --> 18:53.941
We haven't even been talking.

18:53.943 --> 18:56.410
What's going on?

18:56.412 --> 18:58.379
She got confused about our relationship,

18:58.381 --> 18:59.947
and she tried to kiss me.

18:59.949 --> 19:01.148
What?

19:01.150 --> 19:03.117
I've been keeping my distance ever since.

19:03.119 --> 19:05.752
Okay, so she comes to see you last night.

19:05.754 --> 19:07.288
This morning, she wraps a car around a tree.

19:07.290 --> 19:08.922
- That a coincidence?
- I don't know.

19:12.426 --> 19:14.027
You want to take this one off?

19:14.029 --> 19:16.829
No. I'm gonna fix that liver,

19:16.831 --> 19:19.099
and then I'm gonna find out
what the hell's going on.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.135
Promise me that when I die,

19:22.137 --> 19:24.471
you'll be there

19:24.473 --> 19:26.639
to make sure that I cross over.

19:26.641 --> 19:29.541
We're not gonna let you die.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.943
Yes, you are.

19:31.945 --> 19:33.945
Because that's the only thing I want now.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.785
Should we close the hole
in the efferent loop?

19:46.835 --> 19:48.836
No, better to let it heal on its own,

19:48.838 --> 19:50.404
so we're gonna have to bypass it.

19:50.406 --> 19:53.007
Suction, please. Thank you.

19:55.510 --> 19:57.645
It's a tough break for Dr. Lin,

19:57.647 --> 20:00.014
especially if she does decide
to file a malpractice suit.

20:00.016 --> 20:03.411
No one said anything about a lawsuit.

20:04.486 --> 20:06.452
Well, that's what
we're all thinking, isn't it...

20:06.454 --> 20:10.156
including Dr. Lin?

20:10.158 --> 20:13.226
Is she able to operate while
she's under investigation?

20:13.228 --> 20:14.694
You know, for a second there,

20:14.696 --> 20:16.796
I actually thought you were
worried about Maggie.

20:17.068 --> 20:19.564
but you're just angling for
her surgeries, huh?

20:19.566 --> 20:22.067
That's kind of snakey, Dr. Mirani.

20:22.069 --> 20:24.469
Doctors get sued all the time, Dr. Bishop.

20:24.471 --> 20:25.771
Somebody has to cover for them.

20:25.773 --> 20:28.907
Look, I just told you, nobody is...

20:28.909 --> 20:30.876
What is that, Dr. Bishop?

20:32.779 --> 20:34.212
[sighs]

20:43.188 --> 20:44.455
Excuse me.

20:47.826 --> 20:49.193
You can kick me out of the O.R.,

20:49.195 --> 20:50.427
but you can't stop me from watching.

20:50.429 --> 20:52.562
Maggie, I found this in
her abdominal cavity.

20:52.564 --> 20:54.297
What is it?

20:54.299 --> 20:55.699
It's a pledget.

20:55.701 --> 20:57.333
You must have left it inside her
during the surgery

20:57.335 --> 20:58.869
nine months ago.

20:58.871 --> 21:01.838
That's what caused the abscess
and the blockage.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.907
Something doesn't make sense.

21:03.909 --> 21:06.442
Maggie, you need to get a lawyer.

21:14.417 --> 21:16.786
The walls are so ragged,
there's nothing to stitch.

21:16.788 --> 21:19.188
Surgery's been a disaster from the get-go.

21:19.190 --> 21:22.257
Thank you, Dr. Williams. Very helpful.

21:22.259 --> 21:24.226
She's still circling the drain here, guys.

21:24.228 --> 21:26.895
Again, helpful.

21:26.897 --> 21:28.697
Anyone else? I'm all ears.

21:28.699 --> 21:31.265
Yeah. We may be fighting
a losing battle here.

21:31.267 --> 21:33.768
[sighs]

21:33.770 --> 21:36.337
She had a personal tragedy years ago.

21:36.339 --> 21:40.541
Her daughter. Drunk driver.

21:40.543 --> 21:42.910
I'm just saying that she might
not have any fight left.

21:42.912 --> 21:44.745
You think that we're having a hard time

21:44.747 --> 21:46.880
because she's given up?

21:46.882 --> 21:49.683
That's not how this works.

21:49.685 --> 21:51.484
I'll repair the damaged vein.

21:51.486 --> 21:52.720
Is that even a thing?

21:52.722 --> 21:55.622
If I have a viable graft, yes.

21:55.624 --> 21:57.624
Saphenous vein.

21:57.626 --> 21:59.459
It's thick enough,
and she can go without it.

21:59.461 --> 22:01.260
Prep another surgical tray,

22:01.262 --> 22:02.962
place it over the patient's pelvis.

22:02.964 --> 22:05.664
I'm sorry to be playing catch-up
here, but huh?

22:05.666 --> 22:07.566
I'm gonna splay the harvested
vein, cut it into pieces,

22:07.568 --> 22:09.135
and then sew the pieces back together

22:09.137 --> 22:10.502
so that I can make a wider vein.

22:10.504 --> 22:12.839
- You've done it before?
- Yes, on pigs.

22:12.841 --> 22:14.306
Pigs?

22:14.308 --> 22:16.408
Wait, so you've never done this
on an actual patient before?

22:16.410 --> 22:18.243
Well, there's a first time for everything.

22:18.245 --> 22:20.445
Prep the left leg. We'll harvest from there.

22:24.383 --> 22:26.151
Make her stop it, Charlie.

22:28.487 --> 22:30.388
Is there a problem, Charlie?

22:30.390 --> 22:34.524
No, no problem.

22:47.139 --> 22:50.807
So, Molly, you've graduated college,

22:50.809 --> 22:54.477
and there is a world of possibilities

22:54.479 --> 22:56.679
ahead of you now.

22:56.681 --> 22:59.548
But take my word for it.

22:59.550 --> 23:02.018
Go out and buy yourself a plane ticket.

23:02.020 --> 23:05.889
Get your head out of your ass
and go and see the world.

23:05.891 --> 23:08.556
It's so...

23:08.558 --> 23:12.795
God, I remember when I was 25,
I went to Costa Rica,

23:12.797 --> 23:14.863
and, oh,

23:14.865 --> 23:17.299
I hopped on the back of a motorcycle

23:17.301 --> 23:23.906
with a guy named Juan
who was so good-looking.

23:23.908 --> 23:26.174
Mm.

23:26.176 --> 23:31.179
Didn't speak a word of english, but...

23:31.181 --> 23:32.847
What am I doing?

23:36.618 --> 23:38.552
There's gonna be an investigation.

23:38.554 --> 23:40.788
The lawyers are going to do a chart review

23:40.790 --> 23:43.356
of all of your previous gastric
bypass surgeries.

23:43.358 --> 23:45.025
I've never made a mistake like this before.

23:45.027 --> 23:47.260
Well, you've picked a hell of
a patient for your first one.

23:47.262 --> 23:50.897
In my circle, Lois Gresham's
got quite a reputation.

23:50.899 --> 23:52.199
Okay, I need to talk to her, then.

23:52.201 --> 23:54.467
No, no, I would strongly
advise against that.

23:54.469 --> 23:56.602
Something doesn't add up.

23:56.604 --> 23:58.938
Dr. Lin, you do understand
what's going on here.

23:58.940 --> 24:02.407
In medical malpractice, that
sponge that you left behind

24:02.409 --> 24:06.511
is as close to a smoking gun as it gets.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.613
Am I gonna lose my license?

24:08.615 --> 24:11.450
When your lawyer arrives, we'll
talk about your next steps.

24:11.452 --> 24:13.752
Wait, aren't you my lawyer?

24:13.754 --> 24:15.520
I'm Hope Zion's lawyer,

24:15.522 --> 24:18.289
and in this case, the hospital's
gonna want to distance itself

24:18.291 --> 24:21.092
- from the...
- Smoking gun?

24:21.094 --> 24:22.994
That's right.

24:22.996 --> 24:24.128
Which is me.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.164
Yeah. Sorry.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.472
[sighs]

24:35.474 --> 24:37.774
All right, Dr. Williams,
I need you to prop up the liver

24:37.776 --> 24:41.111
on sponges and hold it steady,
I'll give me better access.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.212
Not to be a debbie downer,

24:42.214 --> 24:43.881
but what happens if this doesn't work?

24:43.883 --> 24:46.350
If these grafts don't hold,
there is no plan "B."

24:46.352 --> 24:48.451
She'll need to go on the transplant list.

24:48.453 --> 24:51.453
And we all know where drunk
drivers land on that list.

24:53.056 --> 24:57.559
What are you doing?

24:57.561 --> 24:59.628
Now is not the time.

24:59.630 --> 25:01.330
You have to stop them.

25:04.801 --> 25:07.002
Let her go.

25:07.004 --> 25:08.736
That's what she wants.

25:08.738 --> 25:10.171
Man: Whoa, she's bottoming out again.

25:10.173 --> 25:12.173
You can't shut us out.

25:12.175 --> 25:14.943
Charlie? You need to finish up
and get out of here.

25:14.945 --> 25:17.112
Why won't you listen?

25:17.114 --> 25:19.080
Charlie.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.482
B.P.'s in the danger zone.
She's tachy at 130.

25:21.484 --> 25:23.418
Stop trying to fix me.

25:23.420 --> 25:25.119
You know I can't do that.

25:27.088 --> 25:30.190
They'll keep coming until I get what I want.

25:36.932 --> 25:38.765
Enough!

25:38.767 --> 25:41.434
[monitors beeping]

25:47.174 --> 25:49.309
[sighs]

26:01.887 --> 26:04.256
I'm done with the leg.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.857
Close for me, please.

26:09.728 --> 26:12.564
What the hell was that?

26:12.566 --> 26:15.266
Back to work. Let's go.

26:22.350 --> 26:27.488
[monitor beeping]

26:27.490 --> 26:29.756
How do you deal with all of that?

26:29.758 --> 26:32.225
All of what?

26:32.227 --> 26:35.428
Dr. Harris's... quirks?

26:35.912 --> 26:38.898
We all have quirks, Dr. Williams.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.167
Okay, ready to unclamp.

26:41.169 --> 26:43.035
Let's hope those grafts hold.

26:43.037 --> 26:46.172
Well, if they don't, I'm out of
ideas, and she's out of time.

26:46.174 --> 26:48.473
Dr. Williams, first clamp.

26:53.413 --> 26:55.180
- Nothing.
- That's good.

26:55.182 --> 26:59.084
That's very good.

26:59.086 --> 27:00.485
Here we go.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.989
No leaks!

27:05.991 --> 27:07.558
We're up to full flow.

27:07.560 --> 27:10.127
The plumbing holds.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.029
Looks like we finally caught a break.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.465
[both laugh]

27:14.467 --> 27:15.933
[P.A. beeps]

27:15.935 --> 27:19.069
<i>Dr. Mathis to the nurse's station.</i>

27:19.071 --> 27:21.404
You get a hold of a lawyer?

27:21.406 --> 27:23.607
He said he would meet me here.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.114
You know, during my ortho rotation,

27:31.116 --> 27:34.384
I had this patient with an osteosarcoma.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.253
I cut him open from
his elbow to his shoulder,

27:36.255 --> 27:39.187
and as soon as I made the incision, I knew.

27:39.189 --> 27:41.990
- Wrong arm.
- Wrong arm.

27:41.992 --> 27:45.227
Well, you didn't almost kill your patient.

27:45.229 --> 27:47.796
I'm finished here.

27:47.798 --> 27:49.765
It's as simple as that.

27:49.767 --> 27:51.933
[phone buzzes]

27:55.332 --> 27:56.771
We gotta go.

27:56.773 --> 27:58.673
I'm still waiting for my lawyer.

27:58.675 --> 27:59.861
Oh!

27:59.913 --> 28:02.210
So, the lawyer asked me to
preserve the evidence,

28:02.212 --> 28:03.511
but when I cleaned off the pledget,

28:03.513 --> 28:05.080
I noticed it looked a little weird.

28:05.082 --> 28:07.648
- Weird how?
- It wasn't X-ray detectable.

28:07.650 --> 28:08.984
So, what?

28:08.986 --> 28:11.186
The pledgets we use have
radio-opaque threads.

28:11.188 --> 28:12.552
They show up on X-ray.

28:12.554 --> 28:14.121
I called Dr. Bell.

28:14.123 --> 28:16.590
She said Hope Zion's never even
used these pledgets before.

28:16.592 --> 28:18.461
So, how did it get inside her?

28:18.572 --> 28:21.161
Well, Dr. Bell said they still
use them in The Caribbean,

28:21.163 --> 28:23.430
South and Central America.

28:23.432 --> 28:25.732
My guess, she wasn't getting
the results she wanted

28:25.734 --> 28:28.568
with your bypass, so she went
ahead and had a second surgery.

28:28.570 --> 28:29.935
In the Dominican.

28:29.937 --> 28:33.239
Mm.

28:33.241 --> 28:34.974
[P.A. beeps]

28:34.976 --> 28:37.110
<i>Dr. Francesco, please pick up line 2.</i>

28:37.112 --> 28:38.811
You shouldn't be here.

28:38.813 --> 28:40.746
No harm in checking in, right?

28:40.748 --> 28:42.315
No harm?

28:42.317 --> 28:44.550
You made a promise to me about
what my life was gonna look like

28:44.552 --> 28:46.818
- after that surgery.
- What your life could look like.

28:46.820 --> 28:48.786
I went to a singles resort two months ago.

28:48.788 --> 28:51.256
Everyone was taking surfing classes

28:51.258 --> 28:52.857
and scuba lessons,

28:52.859 --> 28:54.292
but I couldn't.

28:54.294 --> 28:55.760
They wouldn't insure me.

28:55.762 --> 28:57.396
Lois, that has nothing to do with me.

28:57.398 --> 28:59.564
The only reason I booked
the trip was because you said

28:59.566 --> 29:01.233
I'd lose 50 pounds by then.

29:01.235 --> 29:03.001
If you followed the proper protocol.

29:03.003 --> 29:05.236
You know what I did, instead?
I read legal briefs.

29:05.238 --> 29:08.005
I'm sorry, you can't sue me
because you had a bad vacation.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.341
Because I have to work ten times
harder to prove that

29:10.343 --> 29:13.044
a woman my size still
deserves to be promoted.

29:13.046 --> 29:14.978
I know about the second surgery.

29:14.980 --> 29:17.415
The piece of cotton that they
left inside you, we don't...

29:17.417 --> 29:19.083
we don't use those here,

29:19.085 --> 29:21.317
anywhere in North America, actually.

29:21.319 --> 29:25.355
A piece of cotton?

29:25.357 --> 29:29.692
You can't ruin my career because
of somebody else's mistake.

29:29.694 --> 29:32.628
You gave me false hope.

29:32.630 --> 29:34.397
That's worse.

29:39.802 --> 29:41.336
I'll monitor for infection and make sure

29:41.338 --> 29:42.938
her clotting factors are up.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.374
Great, and the rest is up to her.

29:46.943 --> 29:48.244
Alex.

29:48.246 --> 29:49.278
- Mm-hmm.
- There you are.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.126
I want to discuss one of your patient's
head CT's...

29:51.176 --> 29:52.214
I got caught up in the O.R.

29:52.216 --> 29:53.749
I'm sorry, which patient?

29:53.751 --> 29:56.017
Kristine Fields.

29:56.019 --> 29:57.618
She has a slow-growing meningioma in her

29:57.620 --> 29:59.053
- occipital lobe.
- What?

29:59.055 --> 30:00.721
This is unrelated to the accident.

30:00.723 --> 30:02.356
Yeah, it's been there for a few years,

30:02.358 --> 30:05.459
but it could lead to depression,
mood swings.

30:05.461 --> 30:08.629
It's straddling the occipital
lobe and the cerebellum.

30:08.631 --> 30:11.064
That is correct.

30:11.599 --> 30:14.768
Could a tumor in that part of
the brain cause hallucinations?

30:14.770 --> 30:16.503
Yeah, yeah.

30:16.505 --> 30:17.637
Has your patient been complaining about

30:17.639 --> 30:20.674
hallucinations?

30:34.021 --> 30:35.454
Been looking for you.

30:38.425 --> 30:40.426
We need to talk.

30:40.428 --> 30:42.895
I tried to talk to you.

30:42.897 --> 30:45.358
You shut me out.

30:47.234 --> 30:49.600
This was never about us, was it?

30:49.602 --> 30:54.605
They say that time heals all wounds.

30:54.607 --> 30:57.408
Well, it's...

30:57.410 --> 30:59.978
it's been almost three years
since Maddie died,

30:59.980 --> 31:02.213
and...

31:02.701 --> 31:04.912
It's just getting worse.

31:19.937 --> 31:22.295
Did you drive your car into
that tree on purpose?

31:28.873 --> 31:32.508
I could have killed someone.

31:32.510 --> 31:35.978
The same way that Maddie was killed.

31:39.148 --> 31:40.916
Kris...

31:40.918 --> 31:44.887
You know that even if you go...

31:47.523 --> 31:51.960
wherever it is that people go,

31:51.962 --> 31:55.829
Maddie might not be there.

31:55.831 --> 31:59.767
If it was Luke,

31:59.769 --> 32:03.837
and there's the smallest chance
that you might see him again...

32:06.875 --> 32:09.777
I'm just so tired of living without her.

32:18.019 --> 32:21.621
Why couldn't you just let me die?

32:21.623 --> 32:23.790
You know why.

32:23.792 --> 32:27.259
[crying]

32:27.261 --> 32:29.795
I thought I might find you here.

32:29.797 --> 32:32.131
I need you to look at something.

32:36.602 --> 32:39.271
Uh... okay. What am I looking at?

32:39.273 --> 32:42.541
Kristine's head C.T.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.309
You see that?

32:44.734 --> 32:46.202
Yeah, what is it?

32:46.252 --> 32:48.031
She has a meningioma.

32:52.617 --> 32:53.918
I had no idea.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.821
She probably didn't, either,
according to Shahir.

33:00.459 --> 33:04.928
Charlie, he said something else.

33:04.930 --> 33:06.729
Say it.

33:06.731 --> 33:11.901
A tumor in this location could
cause hallucinations.

33:11.903 --> 33:14.271
Like seeing ghosts?

33:14.273 --> 33:16.739
What if you have the same thing?

33:16.741 --> 33:21.844
Alex, because the ghosts that
I see aren't imaginary.

33:21.846 --> 33:24.013
You and I both know that this
kind of tumor, if it grows,

33:24.015 --> 33:25.848
could cause brain stem compression.

33:25.850 --> 33:28.951
- It could even cause...
- Alex, I'm not dying, okay?

33:28.953 --> 33:32.054
Shahir scanned me from head
to toe after my accident.

33:32.056 --> 33:33.990
Yeah, but this kind of tumor
is slow-growing.

33:33.992 --> 33:37.158
It could have been undetectable back then.

33:37.160 --> 33:39.627
Sweetheart, I thought we were
done trying to explain away

33:39.629 --> 33:41.296
this thing I have.

33:41.298 --> 33:44.132
Not if it could kill you.

33:52.493 --> 33:54.594
[knock on door]

33:54.596 --> 33:57.129
Dr. Lin, I am so behind on my work.

33:57.131 --> 33:59.231
Please, just leave me alone.

33:59.233 --> 34:02.934
It'll just take a second.

34:02.936 --> 34:05.804
You deserve better.

34:05.806 --> 34:09.308
You should be able to have fun
and meet someone on vacation

34:09.310 --> 34:13.812
and get a promotion without
working 24 hours a day.

34:13.813 --> 34:17.181
I don't need you to tell me that
the world is an unfair place.

34:17.183 --> 34:20.784
I was so afraid of losing my job
that I lost sight of that.

34:24.155 --> 34:27.225
The hospital has cognitive therapy sessions

34:27.226 --> 34:31.529
that are very supportive for
people suffering from addiction.

34:35.032 --> 34:36.733
Addiction?

34:40.304 --> 34:46.576
I feel out of control all the time.

34:46.578 --> 34:49.212
I thought your surgery
was gonna change that.

34:49.214 --> 34:51.012
And when it didn't,

34:51.014 --> 34:53.549
you went looking for someone
who could fix it.

34:53.551 --> 34:55.784
You must think I'm a horrible person.

34:55.786 --> 34:58.220
No.

34:58.222 --> 35:00.489
I think you're struggling.

35:00.491 --> 35:05.060
There's no shame in that.

35:05.062 --> 35:07.195
I'll call off my lawyers.

35:24.412 --> 35:26.079
The anesthetic's out of her system.

35:26.081 --> 35:27.714
She should be awake by now.

35:27.716 --> 35:29.115
I need to remove this meningioma.

35:29.117 --> 35:31.618
Have to get permission from her family.

35:31.620 --> 35:34.321
No next of kin listed, huh.

35:34.323 --> 35:35.889
Dr. Hamza?

35:35.891 --> 35:41.327
Do you think it's possible for
a patient to will themselves

35:41.329 --> 35:46.265
to die, if they don't have
anything to live for?

35:46.267 --> 35:49.902
She's not dead.

35:49.904 --> 35:51.904
She's in a coma.

35:56.576 --> 35:59.511
Okay, so this is for the pain
for the next couple of days.

35:59.513 --> 36:02.180
You need to take a shower...
I know you're more of a bath guy.

36:02.182 --> 36:04.716
Just wrap some plastic over it. Got it?

36:04.718 --> 36:08.085
For what it's worth, thanks for
not poo-pooing my dreams.

36:08.087 --> 36:09.821
I used to poo-poo that kind of
thing, but it got old.

36:09.823 --> 36:12.190
And besides, love finds a way, right?

36:12.192 --> 36:14.826
So, go, build your love shack,
and get her back.

36:14.828 --> 36:17.060
Actually, you know what?
Give me this for a second.

36:17.062 --> 36:20.631
My cousin, Rob.

36:20.633 --> 36:22.366
He's a contractor.

36:22.368 --> 36:23.701
Give him a call. He'll help you out.

36:23.703 --> 36:25.602
I don't make a lot of money.

36:25.604 --> 36:28.372
Well, you'd make a lot less if
you saw off both your arms.

36:28.374 --> 36:31.241
- Right. Thanks.
- You bet.

36:31.243 --> 36:33.108
That guy didn't need a cheerleader.

36:33.110 --> 36:34.910
He needed a smack upside the head.

36:37.481 --> 36:39.816
You know, you've worked in
my E.R. a couple of times now,

36:39.818 --> 36:42.585
and you've never gotten that chippy with me,

36:42.587 --> 36:44.520
and I've deserved it, so what's up?

36:48.158 --> 36:51.393
I found it at Cassie's.

36:51.395 --> 36:53.194
I've been obsessing over it ever since.

36:53.196 --> 36:56.231
What is it?

36:56.233 --> 36:58.266
Pros and cons.

36:58.268 --> 37:01.670
Cons... not athletic.

37:01.672 --> 37:03.705
- Too vanilla.
- How can I even be vanilla?

37:06.675 --> 37:08.409
Doesn't look at me the same way.

37:08.411 --> 37:10.110
Are you kidding me? You're fine.

37:10.112 --> 37:11.445
There's like 20 pros there.

37:11.447 --> 37:12.680
I don't look at her the same way?

37:12.682 --> 37:14.948
I mean, someone else is looking
at her some other way.

37:14.950 --> 37:17.217
- It does not mean that.
- But that's what it means.

37:17.219 --> 37:19.052
So, find the guy, shed some blood,

37:19.054 --> 37:20.320
and show her who's not athletic.

37:20.322 --> 37:22.189
I mean, what are you doing
walking around with that

37:22.191 --> 37:23.590
in your pocket, not talking to her?

37:23.592 --> 37:25.658
I don't know.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.595
I guess I'm afraid of what she'll say.

37:28.597 --> 37:32.231
You know in my experience,
when you have that hunch,

37:32.233 --> 37:34.166
it's usually right.

37:34.168 --> 37:36.102
Great, now I feel worse.

37:36.104 --> 37:38.605
Yeah, well, I ain't Oprah.

37:38.607 --> 37:40.539
[scoffs]

37:44.176 --> 37:45.944
Hey, wanna grab a drink?

37:45.946 --> 37:48.280
I am so buzzed from the surgery
I just assisted on.

37:48.282 --> 37:50.181
Cassie?

37:50.183 --> 37:52.117
What's up?

37:52.119 --> 37:53.952
You're, uh... you're not happy,

37:53.954 --> 37:57.789
and I think it's time we talked about why.

37:57.791 --> 38:00.925
What do you mean, I'm not happy?
I'm always happy.

38:00.927 --> 38:04.228
I don't think you're happy with us.

38:04.230 --> 38:08.165
Is that why you've been so different lately?

38:08.167 --> 38:10.200
I...

38:10.202 --> 38:11.836
thought I could fix the things

38:11.838 --> 38:13.471
that you said were wrong with me.

38:13.473 --> 38:16.205
What are you... I never said...

38:16.207 --> 38:18.341
I found your list.

38:18.343 --> 38:22.512
Oh, my god.

38:22.514 --> 38:25.381
Oh, my god. Dev, I...

38:27.284 --> 38:30.286
I was reading this magazine,
and it said that I...

38:30.288 --> 38:31.787
You know what? It doesn't matter.

38:31.789 --> 38:33.155
It was juvenile. I'm so sorry.

38:33.157 --> 38:34.289
People make these kinds of lists

38:34.291 --> 38:35.658
when they're weighing their options,

38:35.660 --> 38:38.193
so I need you to be honest with me.

38:38.195 --> 38:40.796
Who? Who's op... who's option number two?

38:40.798 --> 38:42.498
No, no, it was just a magazine.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.866
I promise, there's nobody else.

38:43.868 --> 38:44.934
But you've been thinking about it.

38:44.936 --> 38:49.571
- No, Dev.
- Just tell me the truth!

38:49.573 --> 38:51.840
Then I'll save you the trouble.

38:51.842 --> 38:54.141
It's Dr. Bishop, isn't it?

38:54.143 --> 38:56.644
What?

38:59.915 --> 39:01.716
It... it's-it's a crush.

39:01.718 --> 39:03.651
I... it's a stupid crush.

39:11.693 --> 39:14.828
Dev! Dev, hey, listen.

39:14.830 --> 39:17.263
I apologize for before.

39:17.265 --> 39:19.265
I hope things work out with you
and Cass, she's a great girl.

39:19.267 --> 39:21.702
- It's over.
- Well, she's not that great.

39:21.704 --> 39:23.435
I tell you what, how about you
and I go for a beer, huh?

39:23.437 --> 39:25.505
Thanks but no thanks, Dr. Miller.

39:37.384 --> 39:41.720
My darling Molly... some advice.

39:41.722 --> 39:42.954
[knock on door]

39:42.956 --> 39:45.156
Can it wait?!

39:45.158 --> 39:46.858
Sorry.

39:46.860 --> 39:48.560
Williams?

39:48.562 --> 39:50.762
Come on in.

39:50.764 --> 39:54.065
God, what are you still doing here?

39:54.067 --> 39:57.601
Dr. Reid did an interposition
vein graft today...

39:57.603 --> 39:59.003
- Uh-huh.
- And I was wondering,

39:59.005 --> 40:00.771
since you're the vascular specialist,

40:00.773 --> 40:02.039
if you could teach me.

40:02.041 --> 40:04.374
Now?

40:04.376 --> 40:08.145
Either that, or I'm gonna go
home and spell out the names of

40:08.147 --> 40:11.214
my ex-boyfriends with
gummi bears and eat them.

40:11.216 --> 40:13.350
One by one.

40:13.352 --> 40:16.318
[clears throat]

40:16.320 --> 40:18.254
Of course, I'll show you.

40:18.256 --> 40:19.856
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:19.858 --> 40:22.124
I'm gonna finish up here, and, uh,

40:22.126 --> 40:23.626
I'll meet you down in the skills lab.

40:23.628 --> 40:25.862
Okay. Thank you, Dr. Kinney.

40:32.869 --> 40:34.502
[sighs]

40:38.474 --> 40:41.142
Okay, Molly dolly, well,

40:41.144 --> 40:43.445
it's just me and you,

40:43.447 --> 40:47.848
so, um... some advice from your mom.

40:51.119 --> 40:52.553
[sniffs]

40:52.555 --> 40:57.391
Sorry, baby girl, I was...
I was trying for stoic here.

40:57.393 --> 41:01.729
Um...

41:01.731 --> 41:06.066
You know, the day you were born,

41:06.068 --> 41:09.736
I looked at you.

41:09.738 --> 41:12.472
Had that perfect little face,

41:12.474 --> 41:16.309
and that silly hat they put on you.

41:22.315 --> 41:24.850
And I promised I would always be there.

41:28.121 --> 41:29.922
God, I love you.

41:33.893 --> 41:35.360
Well, the good news about being
a doctor here

41:35.362 --> 41:38.330
is you get front of the line at radiology.

41:38.332 --> 41:40.331
Free jell-O.

41:40.333 --> 41:44.502
[laughs]

41:44.504 --> 41:48.205
Thank you for doing this.

41:48.207 --> 41:50.508
Don't worry.

41:52.044 --> 41:57.213
The only advice I have is...

41:57.215 --> 41:59.683
is love.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.484
With your whole heart.

42:01.486 --> 42:03.787
Woman: We're ready for you, Dr. Harris.

42:03.789 --> 42:08.224
Even when you're terrified,
and you want to run away,

42:08.226 --> 42:11.828
and embrace your imperfections

42:11.830 --> 42:14.496
and the flaws of people around you

42:14.498 --> 42:19.001
because everybody's just doing
the best they can

42:19.003 --> 42:21.436
with what they've got, right?

42:21.438 --> 42:24.707
And that's why you're here.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.842
My sweet girl.

42:26.844 --> 42:30.611
Why any of us are here.

42:30.613 --> 42:32.513
To look after one another.

42:39.055 --> 42:40.555
