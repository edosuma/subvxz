00:08.306 --> 00:10.541
- Uh...
- Ha.

00:11.242 --> 00:13.810
That wasn't the warm reception
I was expecting.

00:13.835 --> 00:15.725
Sorry. Just thinking
about the day ahead.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.416
Speaking of...

00:17.441 --> 00:19.397
dinner before the recruiting
event tonight?

00:19.422 --> 00:20.888
Oh, yeah.

00:21.112 --> 00:22.688
Inspiring the hearts and minds

00:22.713 --> 00:24.693
of the next generation
of Navy sailors.

00:24.718 --> 00:25.684
[laughs]

00:25.831 --> 00:27.831
Don't sound so excited.

00:28.123 --> 00:29.856
Wish I could stay, but Du calls.

00:29.881 --> 00:33.010
Hey, you okay?

00:33.159 --> 00:35.647
You were tossing and turning
like crazy last night.

00:35.672 --> 00:39.013
Yeah, all good,
and yes to dinner.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.122
You're not hearing me,
Dr. Halstead.

00:48.147 --> 00:50.030
With the hospital being sued...

00:50.055 --> 00:53.246
I'm under a microscope.
I get it.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.734
Doesn't make it fair.

00:54.759 --> 00:56.633
You ignored
your patient's wishes

00:56.658 --> 00:59.074
and put the hospital
in jeopardy.

00:59.099 --> 01:00.599
It's absolutely fair,

01:00.624 --> 01:02.793
and now you have to deal
with the consequences.

01:02.818 --> 01:06.396
You're in for interrogatories,
depositions, mediation,

01:06.421 --> 01:08.665
and then possibly a civil trial,

01:08.690 --> 01:11.170
and that doesn't even include
what you may have to

01:11.195 --> 01:13.555
go through with
the state medical board.

01:13.580 --> 01:15.332
Yeah. Okay.

01:15.357 --> 01:17.131
Every move you make
will be scrutinized

01:17.156 --> 01:18.981
by Jennifer Baker's attorneys.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.246
Stick to the script.

01:21.271 --> 01:23.453
Don't give them any more ammo.

01:23.546 --> 01:26.039
Until the lawsuit is settled,

01:26.064 --> 01:28.589
you are the perfect doctor.

01:28.614 --> 01:30.047
Are we clear?

01:32.833 --> 01:36.338
Because your future
at this hospital...

01:36.481 --> 01:38.514
depends on it.

Go to Treatment 4, please.

01:54.592 --> 01:55.902
- You got it.
- Thank you.

01:55.928 --> 01:57.494
Right this way.

01:58.893 --> 02:00.960
All right.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.404
Reese, why so glum?

02:03.429 --> 02:05.496
- Residency Match picks.
- Ah.

02:05.521 --> 02:06.921
They have to be in by end of day

02:06.946 --> 02:08.017
and I have no clue what to do.

02:08.042 --> 02:09.241
I'm literally choosing

02:09.265 --> 02:11.025
where I'll spend
the next four years of my life.

02:11.050 --> 02:13.617
And probably the rest
of your life after that.

02:13.642 --> 02:14.614
Be nice.

02:14.639 --> 02:17.608
- [phone beeps]
- Dr. Choi, incoming!

02:17.633 --> 02:20.300
- Where are we going, Maggie?
- Trauma 2.

02:20.325 --> 02:22.732
- Dad?
- Bret Cooper, 17-year-old male,

02:22.757 --> 02:25.578
down on the ice after a hip
check...  GCS 10, improved to a 12.

02:25.611 --> 02:27.228
- Rotate.
- Must have got his bell rung.

02:27.253 --> 02:28.851
I'm his father.
I was there.

02:28.876 --> 02:30.997
He didn't get his bell rung.
He barely got hit.

02:31.022 --> 02:32.529
Bret, I'm Dr. Choi.
Can you hear me?

02:32.554 --> 02:34.213
- Can you breathe?
- Get me off of here!

02:34.238 --> 02:36.383
All right, let's transfer him.
Reese, on your count.

02:36.543 --> 02:38.809
Okay, nice and easy.
One, two, three.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.361
- [groans]
- Uhh!

02:40.386 --> 02:41.682
Transfer the oxygen,
leave him on the cannula,

02:41.707 --> 02:42.840
and let's get him up
on the monitors.

02:42.865 --> 02:44.386
- On it.
- Check his sat levels.

02:44.411 --> 02:45.631
[whimpering]

02:45.656 --> 02:47.773
Okay. Pupils equal
bilaterally and reactive.

02:47.798 --> 02:50.713
He stayed on his skates
the whole time.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.841
Bret, I need you to focus
on me...  is there any pain?

02:52.866 --> 02:55.182
Ah...  there!
Right where you're touching.

02:55.326 --> 02:56.662
Your show, Reese.

02:57.151 --> 02:58.817
He needs a CT head and spine,

02:58.842 --> 03:00.229
and I would get him a chest X-ray.

03:00.254 --> 03:01.817
- Come on, really?
- We got this.

03:01.842 --> 03:04.286
Oh, my God...  is it a
concussion...  What happened, Jack?

03:04.311 --> 03:06.736
He was battling for a puck
along the boards...  it's nothing.

03:06.761 --> 03:08.627
Here we are in
the emergency room, Jack.

03:08.652 --> 03:10.817
Mr. and Mrs. Cooper, I'm
gonna need you to step outside.

03:10.843 --> 03:12.650
Bret had a bad concussion
last month.

03:12.675 --> 03:15.342
Honey, it's not a concussion.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.280
Look, Doc,
he's got a scholarship

03:17.305 --> 03:18.855
on the table
for Boston College, okay?

03:18.880 --> 03:20.795
Another concussion,
they might rescind the offer.

03:20.820 --> 03:22.924
My eyes...  everything's blurry!

03:22.949 --> 03:23.925
Bret, you have to stay still.

03:23.950 --> 03:26.026
Please, Bret, you have to hold
still...  hold still, buddy.

03:26.051 --> 03:27.981
- Dad!
- Son, you okay?

03:28.006 --> 03:30.750
Dad!
Dad, I can't see!

03:30.775 --> 03:32.381
- Stay still, Bret.
- I can't see!

03:32.407 --> 03:35.383
Stay still, Bret.
Stay still.

- The cat nap's over.
- Oh, yeah.

04:03.245 --> 04:04.701
They're on their way in.

04:04.726 --> 04:07.444
- How long was I down?
- About 20 minutes.

04:07.469 --> 04:09.769
Oh, it felt like 20 seconds.

04:09.793 --> 04:12.292
You know you're only supposed
to work 12-hour shifts, right?

04:12.317 --> 04:13.618
- It's the law.
- I know.

04:13.643 --> 04:15.810
But Dr. Downey
makes his own rules.

04:17.010 --> 04:19.815
- All right...
- Half a minute more.

04:20.374 --> 04:22.307

Come on.

04:22.332 --> 04:24.157
Down.

04:26.113 --> 04:27.757
Ticktock.

04:33.616 --> 04:35.521
Doc, hey.
How is he?

04:35.546 --> 04:37.846
- What happened to his eyesight?
- His vision's fine.

04:37.871 --> 04:39.985
It was a transient impairment,
probably caused by anxiety.

04:40.010 --> 04:42.393
What about his head?
Is it another concussion?

04:42.418 --> 04:44.094
Can't say for sure yet.

04:44.364 --> 04:46.697
We're doing a CT of his head
and cervical spine

04:46.722 --> 04:48.088
to make sure
there's no bleeding.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.212
That might require surgery.

04:49.453 --> 04:50.722
Surgery?
Oh, God.

04:50.747 --> 04:52.339
I'm not saying he needs surgery.

04:52.364 --> 04:53.897
We just need
to rule everything out.

04:53.922 --> 04:55.023
Relax, hon, okay?

04:55.048 --> 04:57.776
Let's not get worked up
before the tests come back.

04:57.801 --> 05:00.380
It's...  it...  it's...

05:01.114 --> 05:04.048
it's like...
it's like I...

05:04.770 --> 05:08.705
It's like I said before.
It...  it l-looks worse than it is.

05:08.730 --> 05:12.257
Look, Doc, I played 18 seasons.
I took a hit or two.

05:12.282 --> 05:14.498
99% of the time, it was nothing.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.790
I sat out a shift,
got right back in.

05:16.815 --> 05:18.181
Trust me, I get it.

05:18.206 --> 05:20.686
Listen, as soon
as we get the tests back,

05:20.711 --> 05:22.596
we'll figure out our next step.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.223
Okay.

05:24.248 --> 05:25.714
- Thanks.
- Sure.

05:25.739 --> 05:27.189
Ma'am.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.443
It's gonna be fine.

05:34.590 --> 05:36.063
Whoa.

05:41.232 --> 05:43.765
- Tired, Dr. Rhodes?
- No, I feel great.

05:43.790 --> 05:45.812
Sign for the lungs,
and let's move.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.149
All right.

05:48.174 --> 05:51.344
- How long was he waiting?
- Half a minute.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.970
- Watch out, please.
- Yes. Spoke with Dr. Bucchheit

05:57.995 --> 06:00.052
about Loratazone...
Think it's gonna work out.

06:00.077 --> 06:02.511
Hey, Greg, let me call you back.

06:04.333 --> 06:07.394
Dr. Halstead...  Will.

06:07.419 --> 06:10.108
Zoe, how are you?
Your hair's different.

06:10.158 --> 06:12.023
- I like it.
- Yeah?

06:12.048 --> 06:14.090
Yeah. Thank you.

06:14.918 --> 06:16.757
Had a great time
the other night.

06:16.955 --> 06:19.576
You've officially converted me
to a rye whiskey girl.

06:19.616 --> 06:22.711
It cleanses the soul,
or at least the memory.

06:23.002 --> 06:24.463
Things any better?

06:24.488 --> 06:25.887
Well, they haven't gotten worse.

06:25.912 --> 06:27.312
Guess that's something.

06:27.355 --> 06:30.756
Good.
Cup half full...  my kind of guy.

06:30.994 --> 06:33.149
Round two soon?

06:33.174 --> 06:34.974
I'm free tonight.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.452
I'll call you
when my shift's over.

06:36.477 --> 06:38.802
Yeah.
Okay.

06:41.056 --> 06:43.172
Mr. Anderson,
I'm Dr. Halstead.

06:43.197 --> 06:44.470
Oh, please, call me Tim.

06:44.495 --> 06:45.994
You got it, Tim.

06:46.112 --> 06:47.705
So you're a diabetic?

06:47.730 --> 06:50.402
Yeah, since after college.
Lucky bastard, I know.

06:50.782 --> 06:52.582
I see you're on the
blood-thinner Warfarin.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.747
- How's your INR?
- Don't know.

06:54.772 --> 06:56.420
I haven't had it checked
in a few weeks.

06:56.445 --> 06:59.403
Mm-hmm. Let's have a listen.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.629
Uh-huh.

07:04.861 --> 07:06.854
Yeah, you've also had
a mitral valve replaced.

07:06.879 --> 07:07.950
I can hear the clicking.

07:07.975 --> 07:09.955
Yeah, two stent operations,
an atherectomy,

07:09.980 --> 07:11.743
and a laser angioplasty.

07:11.768 --> 07:14.269
And somehow
still putting us all to shame.

07:14.299 --> 07:16.229
You look like
a Bergdorf's catalog.

07:16.326 --> 07:18.460
Well, look good,
feel good, Dr. Manning.

07:18.485 --> 07:20.218
I was wondering
if I would see you.

07:20.951 --> 07:23.345
Dr. Halstead,
you mind if I sit in?

07:23.370 --> 07:25.008
You don't have to ask.

07:25.384 --> 07:26.680
So what's going on today?

07:26.705 --> 07:28.171
Last time you were in
for a foot infection.

07:28.196 --> 07:29.236
- Any reoccurrence?
- No,

07:29.261 --> 07:30.585
just a little shortness
of breath.

07:30.630 --> 07:32.731
I was cleaning out my attic,

07:32.756 --> 07:34.422
started feeling a little light-headed.

07:34.524 --> 07:36.358
Nothing, really, to worry about,

07:36.383 --> 07:37.786
but, still,
better safe than sorry.

07:37.811 --> 07:38.768
Anything else?

07:38.793 --> 07:40.426
My left leg's been aching a bit.

07:40.452 --> 07:42.899
Mr. Anderson
is in congestive heart failure.

07:42.924 --> 07:44.757
- Oh?
- It's mild.

07:44.782 --> 07:46.945
At least, that's what
my last doctor told me.

07:46.970 --> 07:49.771
But you could still stand
to lose some of that fluid.

07:49.881 --> 07:53.006
All right, what we're gonna
do... chest X-Ray, EKG, labs.

07:53.031 --> 07:55.672
Have IR do an angiogram,
check the flow of the leg.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.139
Here I was, thinking
I was gonna make it home

07:58.164 --> 07:59.797
for the Bulls game.

08:01.370 --> 08:03.383
Don't worry, Tim, we'll
get you the Wi-Fi password.

- Hey.

08:11.230 --> 08:13.803
A little overboard.
His leg wasn't cold.

08:13.828 --> 08:15.540
A vascular ultrasound, maybe,

08:15.565 --> 08:17.361
but an angiogram's
a bit much to start.

08:17.386 --> 08:19.247
He's a decade-long vasculopath.

08:19.272 --> 08:20.612
His blood vessels are shot.

08:20.637 --> 08:22.107
He's not indicating.

08:22.132 --> 08:24.665
I hardly think he needs another
uncomfortable procedure.

08:24.690 --> 08:26.559
There's no telling
what he needs.

08:26.746 --> 08:29.154
Look, I am not
dismissing you, Nat,

08:29.179 --> 08:30.731

09:37.556 --> 09:40.563
- Sweet! Thanks, Doc.
- Sure.

09:42.366 --> 09:45.170
Sports aren't really my thing.

09:46.339 --> 09:47.661
What'd I tell you, hon?

09:47.686 --> 09:49.436
Nothing.
The kid's a rock.

09:49.461 --> 09:52.229
Like father, like son.
Doc, thanks so much.

09:52.254 --> 09:53.583
You got it.

09:56.284 --> 10:00.246
Okay, so let's go tell
those bad-news scouts

10:00.271 --> 10:02.545
that the nation's number-one
recruit is good to go.

10:02.570 --> 10:05.317
Dr. Choi, is it possible
you missed something?

10:05.342 --> 10:06.952
Bret complains of headaches.
Mom.

10:06.977 --> 10:08.238
He's had this one for two weeks.

10:08.263 --> 10:09.963
Joan, enough!

10:12.115 --> 10:15.731
Look, the scan
came back clean, honey.

10:15.756 --> 10:18.982
Stop looking for something
that isn't there.

10:19.433 --> 10:21.066
LP?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.055
Headaches could be
a symptom of meningitis.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.247
An infection like that wouldn't
show up on the CT.

10:26.272 --> 10:27.962
Could explain why a minor hit

10:27.987 --> 10:29.753
caused such a big
reaction earlier.

10:29.778 --> 10:32.009
I think it's best
we do a spinal tap.

10:32.034 --> 10:35.255
Okay, but meningitis,
that is treatable, right?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.480
Hockey can wait
for an hour, Jack.

10:37.907 --> 10:39.841
Okay, Joan.

10:40.822 --> 10:42.366
So, Bret,

10:42.391 --> 10:45.056
if you could lie on your side

10:45.081 --> 10:46.927
and pull your knees
up to your chest,

10:46.952 --> 10:49.031
I'm gonna numb you
with a local anesthetic.

10:49.056 --> 10:50.228
Are you okay?

10:50.253 --> 10:51.786
Feeling a little dizzy.

10:51.811 --> 10:54.685
- Okay.
- Bret? Bret!

10:54.710 --> 10:56.543
- Bret!
- Bret!

10:56.568 --> 10:58.343
- Bret!
- Reese!

10:58.368 --> 11:00.706
Little help!

11:05.268 --> 11:07.873
- Anything hurt?
- Not really.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.828
Gonna be stiff tomorrow,
though, aren't I?

11:09.853 --> 11:12.638
Yeah, but pain builds character.

11:12.980 --> 11:14.713
According to who, exactly?

11:14.738 --> 11:16.004
[both chuckle]

11:16.029 --> 11:17.771
Bret still needs an LP.
You good?

11:17.796 --> 11:20.099
Uh... fourth period,

11:20.124 --> 11:23.275
bottom of the 9th...
Put me back in, Coach.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.633
Butchered hockey, football,

11:24.658 --> 11:27.251
and baseball
in one sentence... impressive.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.182
Dr. Charles,
thanks for coming down.

11:30.207 --> 11:32.086
Quick favor?
Shoot.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.425
Uh, got a patient,
17-year-old hockey player.

11:34.450 --> 11:36.181
I heard.
Bret "Bear" Cooper.

11:36.206 --> 11:37.487
Dad was a heavy.

11:37.512 --> 11:38.922
Hear the kid's even better.

11:38.947 --> 11:40.413
Wouldn't have taken you
for a jock.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.206
Oh, come on... sport's the
oldest form of group therapy.

11:43.231 --> 11:44.830
We yell.
We scream.

11:44.855 --> 11:46.663
Testosterone spikes.

11:46.987 --> 11:49.316
Every now and then, we even
get to believe in a miracle.

11:49.341 --> 11:50.648
Your patient...

11:50.673 --> 11:53.121
It's actually his father Jack
that I needed the consult on.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.574
He's exhibiting memory loss,
hand tremors, agitation...

11:55.599 --> 11:57.466
Could be Chronic
Traumatic Encephalopathy,

11:57.491 --> 11:59.949
but I'd like to rule out
anxiety and depression first.

11:59.974 --> 12:01.303
CTE sounds right.

12:01.328 --> 12:02.478
Get hit in the head
that many times,

12:02.503 --> 12:03.760
it's bound to catch up with you.

12:03.785 --> 12:06.052
- Yeah.
- Past always does.

12:08.967 --> 12:10.352
Listen,
sorry about the other day.

12:10.377 --> 12:12.210
We got slammed.
I get it.

12:12.235 --> 12:13.974
E.D. never sleeps.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.333
But if you keep skipping
our sessions, buddy,

12:16.664 --> 12:18.997
I'm afraid you won't either.

12:24.230 --> 12:27.131
So finally, as we reintroduce
blood into your lungs,

12:27.156 --> 12:29.575
we will manually compress
the pulmonary artery

12:29.600 --> 12:32.332
to avoid
initial volume overload.

12:32.431 --> 12:34.980
Hey, can I see those lungs
again, please, Doc?

12:35.005 --> 12:36.605
Yeah, of course.

12:39.651 --> 12:41.444
Science fiction meets reality.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.302
[both chuckle]

12:43.438 --> 12:45.605
I just hope they work as well
once they're in me.

12:45.630 --> 12:47.561
Believe me,
you couldn't be in better hands

12:47.586 --> 12:49.286
than Dr. Downey's.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.629
We'll see you in the O.R.,
Mr. Mosconi.

12:54.603 --> 12:56.684
Your lungs
got a Chicago Fire escort

12:56.709 --> 12:58.242
like I have never seen.

12:58.275 --> 13:00.357
Brothers in arms.

13:03.815 --> 13:06.015
This is really happening.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.075
It is.
We'll see you on the other side.

13:09.405 --> 13:11.057
Yeah.

13:14.087 --> 13:16.054
Quite the presentation,
Dr. Rhodes.

13:16.347 --> 13:17.857
I wanted to be thorough.

13:17.882 --> 13:19.581
Great.

13:19.606 --> 13:22.515
Next time, in English.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.810
Patient's already overwhelmed.

13:25.947 --> 13:28.082
Okay.

13:28.879 --> 13:30.816
<i>Start of the second,
Bulls are looking strong... </i>

13:30.841 --> 13:33.698
- What's the score?
- Bulls are up by 4.

13:33.723 --> 13:35.611
Nice.

13:36.874 --> 13:39.542
Dr. Manning,
Tim's blood work came back.

13:39.567 --> 13:40.628
INR's high.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.882
Same thing happened
the last time he came in.

13:42.907 --> 13:44.817
All right, let's ease him off
the blood thinners

13:44.842 --> 13:46.719
and give him 10mg of Vitamin K

13:46.744 --> 13:48.246
to level off
his clotting factors.

13:48.271 --> 13:49.488
- Put in the order.
- Thanks.

13:49.513 --> 13:52.791
Oh, those tests
that Dr. Halstead ordered?

13:52.816 --> 13:54.182
All negative.

13:54.207 --> 13:57.241
Put Tim through
all that stress for nothing.

14:04.547 --> 14:08.790
They won't listen.
They're doing a lumbar puncture.

14:09.141 --> 14:13.276
That is exactly what I was
trying to tell them.

14:13.370 --> 14:16.081
Okay, yeah.
I'll keep you posted, Doc.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.306
Thanks.

14:17.331 --> 14:18.797
Mr. Cooper?

14:18.976 --> 14:21.687
Dan Charles.
Boy, what a pleasure.

14:22.092 --> 14:23.992
That's quite a grip.

14:24.017 --> 14:26.679
Good for stick handling.
You ever played hockey?

14:26.704 --> 14:29.194
Oh, a million years ago.
Only Junior League goalie,

14:29.219 --> 14:31.931
but had one shut-out.
Best day of my life.

14:31.956 --> 14:34.099
Ha. I loved
the Junior Leagues.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.858
Played the game for no other
reason than it was fun.

14:37.038 --> 14:39.031
Don't read too much into that.

14:39.056 --> 14:41.361
You are a shrink, right?

14:41.386 --> 14:42.915
Oh, boy, what gave me away?

14:42.940 --> 14:45.444
Well, the team always
had a couple on the payroll.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.369
Soft spoken, loved eye contact,

14:47.394 --> 14:49.537
and not to mention
the sweater vest

14:49.562 --> 14:51.173
and the Rockports didn't help.

14:51.198 --> 14:53.897
[laughs] Oh, geez.
Well, then you know

14:53.967 --> 14:55.520
exactly what
my next question's gonna be.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.279
How am I feeling?

14:57.459 --> 14:58.893
Conflicted.

14:58.918 --> 15:01.000
I mean,
my son is in the E.D.,

15:01.025 --> 15:02.624
so as a dad, I'm concerned.

15:02.886 --> 15:04.419
But as a former player,

15:04.444 --> 15:07.525
knowing that leaving it out
on the ice is what got us here,

15:07.550 --> 15:09.216
couldn't be more proud.

15:09.503 --> 15:12.171
Sacrifice in the name
of sport...

15:12.405 --> 15:14.078
Wouldn't know
anything about that.

15:14.103 --> 15:16.625
- I never played hockey.
- You know, that's a shame.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.569
I mean, you got
great width, you know?

15:18.594 --> 15:19.958
You never thought
about playing goalie?

15:19.983 --> 15:22.951
Mm... more of a bookworm
than a bruiser.

15:22.976 --> 15:24.698
[chuckles] Yeah, I got you.

15:25.143 --> 15:26.633
The spinal tap's done.

15:26.658 --> 15:28.624
We'll get it off to the lab
and go from there.

15:28.775 --> 15:29.974
Great.

15:30.195 --> 15:31.394
Well, nice to meet you, Doc.

15:31.419 --> 15:32.618
Real pleasure.

15:33.691 --> 15:36.182
- Short-term memory loss...
- As of now,

15:36.207 --> 15:38.232
CTE's only diagnosable
postmortem,

15:38.257 --> 15:40.690
but I'm afraid
your instincts are correct.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.368
- You still at it?
- Mm-hmm.

15:46.393 --> 15:47.918
Didn't your mom
ever tell you you'd go blind

15:47.943 --> 15:49.071
staring at a screen that long?

15:49.096 --> 15:50.745
My mother
was a litigation attorney

15:50.770 --> 15:53.152
and worked 90-hour weeks.
She didn't tell me much.

15:53.177 --> 15:54.910
Well, guess
it's on the nurses then.

15:55.186 --> 15:57.103
All right, this hospital's
too far from the city.

15:57.128 --> 15:58.836
You wouldn't last a week
in the boonies.

15:58.861 --> 16:01.630
[laughs] Oh,
and this one's way too vanilla.

16:02.046 --> 16:04.299
You've been rolling with us.
You got a little flavor now.

16:04.324 --> 16:06.330
This one's Boston?

16:06.355 --> 16:08.021
Winters are terrible.

16:09.628 --> 16:11.694
All right,
you got me on that one.

16:11.772 --> 16:15.673
Maybe... we're angling
for you to stay.

16:15.698 --> 16:17.607
Chicago Med's definitely
in the running.

16:17.632 --> 16:18.831
Ah?

16:18.856 --> 16:20.255
It's my specialty I'm torn over.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.914
I always thought
I'd choose pathology,

16:21.939 --> 16:25.456
but the E.D.'s really...
grown on me.

16:25.481 --> 16:26.920
I can't believe
I just said that.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.512
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

16:28.537 --> 16:31.242
You're not the first lab geek
that we've turned.

16:36.227 --> 16:38.060
You shouldn't be
the last one in.

16:38.085 --> 16:39.707
Patient's ready, Dr. Downey.

16:39.732 --> 16:40.967
Let's get this show on the road.

16:40.992 --> 16:42.926
Propofol's going in.

16:43.578 --> 16:46.909
[rapid beeping]

16:46.934 --> 16:48.901
Pressure's tanking.

16:49.862 --> 16:52.405
- No pulse.
- Rhodes, on his chest.

16:56.037 --> 16:58.037
Allen, how much EPI
has he gotten?

16:58.062 --> 16:59.136
20 mics.

16:59.161 --> 17:01.010
[flatline tone]

17:01.035 --> 17:03.529
- [flatline stops]
- [steady beeping]

17:03.554 --> 17:04.753
Got a pulse back.

17:04.779 --> 17:06.979
Good waveform on the A Line.

17:07.010 --> 17:08.476
He's in sinus rhythm.

17:08.530 --> 17:10.430
Let's TEE.

17:10.454 --> 17:11.521
All right.

17:11.546 --> 17:14.486
- Here you go, Doctor.
- Thank you, Nurse.

17:17.959 --> 17:19.933
Get in there.

17:21.963 --> 17:24.396
Show me what I need to see.

17:24.498 --> 17:26.351
Look at the aortic valve.

17:26.686 --> 17:28.786
Valve area's .6.

17:28.817 --> 17:31.289
Cardiologist said it was only
mild to moderately stenotic.

17:31.314 --> 17:32.593
I know, but this is critical.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.250
He needs a new valve.

17:34.275 --> 17:36.408
How long have the lungs
been perfusing?

17:36.433 --> 17:39.221
Including transport,
at least six hours.

17:39.246 --> 17:41.213
They're good for another
five to six,

17:41.315 --> 17:43.552
but we can't transplant
until we fix that valve.

17:43.577 --> 17:45.543
Keep him deep... between
his lungs and the blockage,

17:45.568 --> 17:46.968
he won't tolerate
going under again.

17:46.993 --> 17:49.732
You and I need to figure out
a plan quickly.

17:50.693 --> 17:53.367
- [alarm]
- <i>Code blue, treatment 1.</i>

17:53.393 --> 17:56.278
<i>Code blue, treatment 1.</i>

17:56.303 --> 17:57.636
What happened?

17:57.661 --> 17:59.155
A second ago,
he was perfectly stable.

17:59.180 --> 18:01.113
- We were talking.
- Hold compressions.

18:01.269 --> 18:03.035
- [flatline tone]
- No pulse.

18:03.059 --> 18:05.632
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

18:07.575 --> 18:08.641
No breath sounds.

18:08.666 --> 18:09.899
V-Fib!

18:09.924 --> 18:11.682
Crash cart!

18:14.425 --> 18:16.869
- Charge to 200 Joules.
- Charging.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.996
- Charged.
- Everyone clear.

18:19.257 --> 18:21.224
- [beep beep]
- Nat, back away.

18:21.249 --> 18:22.943
No, just give me
one more second.

18:22.968 --> 18:24.229
I see the cords.

18:24.255 --> 18:26.222
I'm almost in.

18:26.247 --> 18:28.619
All right, tube's in.
Let's go.

18:28.644 --> 18:30.077
Everyone clear!

18:31.770 --> 18:34.247
Nothing.
Copy. O.R. on standby.

18:34.272 --> 18:35.117
- Round of EPI.
- Got it.

18:35.142 --> 18:37.464
- Charging.
- Charged.

18:37.715 --> 18:39.086
- Clear!
- Clear.

18:39.111 --> 18:40.410
- [beep beep]
- [thump]

18:41.260 --> 18:42.459
Still in fib.

18:42.484 --> 18:43.857
Nat, you take over compressions.

18:43.882 --> 18:45.859
Don't stop for anything.
April, where's that EPI?

18:45.884 --> 18:47.050
EPI's in.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.262
Clear.
Clear!

18:49.287 --> 18:51.363
- [beep beep]
- [thump]

18:51.388 --> 18:53.405
- [murmurs in background]
- CPR. EPI again.

18:53.430 --> 18:54.868
Follow it with an amp of bicarb.

18:54.893 --> 18:56.359
Yes, Doctor.

18:58.822 --> 19:01.142
Asystole... he's got no pulse.

19:01.281 --> 19:03.048
I got it.

31:07.659 --> 31:09.963
Listen to me.
I know what you're thinking.

31:09.988 --> 31:12.923
"One in a million hit
can't happen to me,"

31:13.147 --> 31:14.913
but it can.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.942
It can.

31:18.967 --> 31:20.467
I know.

31:22.449 --> 31:24.315
Think about it.

31:26.544 --> 31:28.872
[pat pat]

31:34.470 --> 31:36.971
You'll find another path...

31:39.775 --> 31:41.441
And it'll feel right.

31:41.677 --> 31:43.777
I'm sure of it.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.833
I was so certain I was right.

31:51.858 --> 31:54.735
I did everything I could,
covered every single base...

31:54.760 --> 31:56.359
I'm sure you did.

31:56.384 --> 31:57.850
The worst part...

31:57.875 --> 32:00.375
I attacked a colleague.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.210
A friend.

32:02.236 --> 32:03.881
You're under a lot of pressure.

32:03.906 --> 32:05.930
Everyone knows that.

32:06.477 --> 32:08.043
If you apologize,

32:08.068 --> 32:12.114
I'm Dr. Manning
will understand.

32:13.219 --> 32:15.349
It's her, right?

32:17.385 --> 32:20.318
Why don't we rain-check dinner tonight?

32:21.167 --> 32:22.933
It's okay.

32:24.575 --> 32:26.675
Thanks, Zoe.

32:46.638 --> 32:48.281
We are ready to transplant.

32:48.306 --> 32:51.349
Not yet.
You cut too shallow.

32:51.374 --> 32:54.091
If the vessels are too long.
They could thrombose.

32:54.116 --> 32:57.292
Here, trim the atrial cuff.

33:01.675 --> 33:04.291
Not too deep.

33:04.965 --> 33:07.351
Not too quickly.

33:07.376 --> 33:09.633
Don't want to damage the vessel.

33:12.530 --> 33:14.664
Good.

33:15.178 --> 33:17.624
All right,
let's get the lungs in.

33:18.550 --> 33:20.550
Maybe you should take over.

33:20.575 --> 33:23.309
Let's get the lungs in.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.250
Yes, sir.

33:26.365 --> 33:29.467
- The aortic cannula's loose.
- [rapid beeping]

33:29.492 --> 33:31.028
BP and sats falling.

33:31.053 --> 33:33.714
Get him clamped now
or he's gonna bleed out.

33:34.035 --> 33:36.736
[beeping continues]

33:36.761 --> 33:39.804
<i>[tense music]</i>

33:46.621 --> 33:48.387
Got it.
He's clamped.

33:48.412 --> 33:50.594
And the pressure is improving.

33:54.441 --> 33:57.409
Let's get the lungs in
and get him off the pump.

33:58.789 --> 34:00.889
Are you all right?

34:00.914 --> 34:03.315
You're gonna have
to take lead from here.

34:07.119 --> 34:09.427
Okay, I'll cover you.

34:09.452 --> 34:11.132
I'm ready for the lung.

34:11.158 --> 34:13.360
Here, Doctor.

34:15.677 --> 34:18.110
Bronchus first,

34:18.136 --> 34:20.735
followed by the left atrial cuff

34:20.761 --> 34:23.775
and the pulmonary artery.

34:25.132 --> 34:26.614
Good.

34:26.639 --> 34:29.373
Let's start sewing.

34:29.399 --> 34:31.299
4-0 Prolene.

34:36.454 --> 34:38.353
And that's the cerebellum.

34:38.379 --> 34:40.766
[continues murmuring]

34:46.639 --> 34:49.507
You see what Bret tweeted?

34:50.007 --> 34:51.674
"Off my skates
for a couple of days,"

34:51.699 --> 34:53.184
but I'll be
back at All Star Clinics,

34:53.208 --> 34:55.654
"stronger than ever.
#Downbutnotout."

34:55.679 --> 34:56.811
Seriously?

34:56.835 --> 34:58.876
He's still gonna play?

34:58.901 --> 35:00.862
I told him he could die.

35:02.065 --> 35:04.840
Boys will always want to be
better than their fathers,

35:04.865 --> 35:07.666
which is precisely
what their fathers want.

35:07.691 --> 35:09.591
Ready to go?

35:12.429 --> 35:14.762
"What price glory," right?

35:22.909 --> 35:24.882
Headed out?
Made your decision?

35:24.907 --> 35:27.810
Yep, just now.

35:27.835 --> 35:31.089
Let me guess...
E.D. strikes again.

35:31.114 --> 35:33.376
No... pathology.

35:33.401 --> 35:34.938
What?

35:36.021 --> 35:37.887
It's the patients.

35:38.221 --> 35:40.288
They come in,
and you want to help them.

35:40.313 --> 35:41.805
You care about them,
so you try to connect,

35:41.830 --> 35:43.917
and, just when you think
you're getting through,

35:43.942 --> 35:45.704
they go back to
what they were doing before.

35:45.729 --> 35:47.523
And it's like you were
never even there...

35:47.682 --> 35:49.983
Like everything you did
was for nothing.

35:50.008 --> 35:53.009
I can't take a life of that.

35:53.133 --> 35:54.799
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:06.827 --> 36:08.760
I am in no mood, Will.

36:08.785 --> 36:10.523
I get it.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.164
Natalie, I'm sorry.

36:13.189 --> 36:16.365
It wasn't the vitamin K.
I was wrong.

36:16.390 --> 36:17.560
You, wrong?

36:17.645 --> 36:19.478
Amazing.

36:19.503 --> 36:21.336
Yeah.

36:21.361 --> 36:22.625
I've been an ass,

36:22.975 --> 36:26.009
not just today...
Since last week...

36:26.034 --> 36:29.081
Before that.

36:29.106 --> 36:32.007
I should not have yelled at you.

36:32.538 --> 36:35.639
Why do you always
take things out on me?

36:35.664 --> 36:38.478
You invite me in,
and then you push me back.

36:38.503 --> 36:41.995
You ask for my opinion, and then
you completely ignore me.

36:42.090 --> 36:44.175
It hurts, Will.

36:44.200 --> 36:48.867
You wouldn't treat anyone else
like this, so why me?

36:51.691 --> 36:53.491
Don't you know?

36:55.732 --> 36:57.665
No.

37:45.976 --> 37:48.259
Mr. Mosconi's
gas exchange is good.

37:48.284 --> 37:49.361
We'll rest him overnight,

37:49.386 --> 37:51.052
hopefully extubate him
in the morning.

37:51.231 --> 37:53.832
I thought
maybe you'd be at home resting

37:53.857 --> 37:56.134
after that episode in the O.R.

37:56.158 --> 37:57.958
Episode?

38:00.281 --> 38:02.815
You didn't need me to take over.

38:05.335 --> 38:07.184
I've usually found,
Dr. Rhodes,

38:07.209 --> 38:10.086
that when given responsibility,
people rise to the occasion.

38:12.180 --> 38:16.248
I know the last few weeks
have been... challenging,

38:16.810 --> 38:18.143
and I'd be lying
if I said the months to come

38:18.168 --> 38:20.314
will be any easier.

38:20.490 --> 38:23.191
I have an impossible amount
to teach you

38:23.864 --> 38:26.364
in a diminishing amount of time.

38:28.525 --> 38:31.759
You don't have to show me
how smart you are,

38:31.861 --> 38:33.895
and you don't have to please me.

38:35.165 --> 38:37.498
Just learn.

38:51.159 --> 38:53.652
He's breathing on his own.

38:55.324 --> 38:57.773
Indeed he is.

39:10.624 --> 39:12.423
Sorry about dinner.

39:12.448 --> 39:14.958
Wasn't sure you were gonna show.

39:17.144 --> 39:20.825
- I...
- What is it?

39:27.676 --> 39:29.609
I've been talking
to Dr. Charles,

39:29.634 --> 39:31.634
the hospital psychiatrist.

39:31.717 --> 39:34.985
Shared some things
about my service... tough things.

39:35.010 --> 39:36.309
You don't have to explain.
I know.

39:36.334 --> 39:39.924
I thought if I didn't think
about it or talk about it...

39:41.104 --> 39:43.171
I'm here.

39:47.447 --> 39:49.314
My dad was Navy.

39:49.339 --> 39:51.058
That why you enlisted?

39:51.083 --> 39:52.414
It just always seemed like

39:52.440 --> 39:54.774
that was what I was gonna do.

39:55.255 --> 39:57.021
There's a room
full of kids in there

39:57.046 --> 39:59.013
who are gonna ask you
about your service.

39:59.038 --> 40:00.971
What are you gonna tell 'em?

40:02.418 --> 40:04.652
That I'd do it again.

40:11.327 --> 40:15.596
<i>[pop music plays]</i>

40:15.621 --> 40:18.689
Scotch... rocks.
Thanks.

40:20.346 --> 40:22.079
Who's winning?

40:22.149 --> 40:24.416
The Blackhawks by one.

40:24.441 --> 40:26.228
Nice.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.191
Thanks.

40:39.132 --> 40:41.767
We haven't exactly been the same
since I started with Downey.

40:41.792 --> 40:45.093
No, we haven't.

40:46.213 --> 40:49.547
Sam, I know
this can't be easy for you...

40:52.587 --> 40:56.656
But if you're gonna make me
choose between you and Downey...

40:56.837 --> 40:59.104
It's gonna be Downey.

41:00.747 --> 41:02.453
Yeah.

41:06.788 --> 41:09.519
I'm not gonna make you choose.
