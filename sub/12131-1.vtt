00:35.434 --> 00:38.151
<i>Mr. Stewart,
I'd like to talk to you.</i>

00:38.153 --> 00:40.003
<i>I've come...
I've come to Washburn Creek</i>

00:40.005 --> 00:42.906

Oh, good Jesus.</i>

00:43.508 --> 00:45.425
<i>To your home.
I've come to your home</i>

00:45.427 --> 00:48.995

00:48.997 --> 00:51.397
<i>I'd like very much to ask...</i>

<i>Maryanne...
I'd like to talk to you</i>

It's about Maryanne.</i>

01:17.657 --> 01:20.725
<i>Maryanne?</i>

01:24.680 --> 01:26.465
MARYANNE: <i>Hold still.</i>

01:26.467 --> 01:28.633
CHILD: <i>I don't want to
go to bed yet, not now.</i>

01:28.635 --> 01:30.918
WOMAN: <i>Oh, stop your fussing.
Come on.</i>

01:30.920 --> 01:32.953
(BLOWS AIR)

01:32.955 --> 01:35.790
The splinter already hurts
more than pulling it out.

01:35.792 --> 01:37.558
Okay?

01:39.211 --> 01:41.462
(WHISPERS)
Mary...

01:41.464 --> 01:44.382
- CHILD: I'm not sleepy.
- WOMAN: We'll store you to bed.

01:44.384 --> 01:46.384
You need to take your rest too,
Mary,

01:46.386 --> 01:48.819
if you want to look pretty when
your Irish comes courting tomorrow.

01:48.821 --> 01:51.038
You hush.

01:54.509 --> 01:56.476
(WHISPERS)
Hold still.

- <i>They were in</i> the Williams house.

02:28.009 --> 02:29.558
- Indians?
- Stay with the women.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.893
Down into the root cellar, get.

02:31.895 --> 02:34.213
WOMAN: Let's go.

02:35.281 --> 02:37.549
- MAN: Come on now.
- WOMAN: Come on.

02:37.551 --> 02:39.367
Come on down.

02:41.405 --> 02:43.538
Keep your lamp low
and this door locked.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.440
You don't open it no matter what.

02:45.442 --> 02:48.743
Ma! Ma!

- Ma, ma.

MAN: <i>Maryanne?</i>
Mary?

04:12.642 --> 04:16.278
Anybody home?

04:16.279 --> 04:18.279
Mr. Williams, sir,

04:18.281 --> 04:20.599
the Stewarts aren't home.

04:23.452 --> 04:26.219
Oh, God.

04:27.622 --> 04:29.439
Oh, Jesus.

04:30.876 --> 04:33.110
Oh!

04:35.397 --> 04:37.781
The Stewarts are gone.

04:37.783 --> 04:40.450
Easy. Did Mary say anything
to you about leaving?

04:40.452 --> 04:41.785
No.

04:41.787 --> 04:43.787
What about the williamses?

04:43.789 --> 04:46.089
No, you gotta...

04:56.066 --> 04:58.001
Oh, God.

05:18.404 --> 05:20.488
Damn it.

05:42.143 --> 05:44.245
<i>Indians took 'em.</i>

05:44.247 --> 05:46.847
God help 'em.

05:48.149 --> 05:50.584
We've got to get them back.

06:01.396 --> 06:03.396
I hit three men up there.

06:03.398 --> 06:04.730
Really?

06:04.732 --> 06:07.033
Indians, anyway.
I hit them dead.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.810
Don't feed Dobie your horseshit,
Mr. Parcher.

06:16.812 --> 06:19.679
That ain't horseshit.
That's history.

06:19.681 --> 06:21.681
Boy ought to learn
where he's come from.

06:21.683 --> 06:23.799
Mind the cursing
in front of my boy.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.101
Yes, ma'am.

06:36.595 --> 06:39.931
Great God almighty,
is that coconut cake?

06:39.933 --> 06:41.500
Mom got it special.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.285
Baked it.

06:43.287 --> 06:45.587
Coconut cake from back east.

06:48.124 --> 06:51.025
10 years back,
not a mile from here,

06:51.027 --> 06:53.427
I had to eat a horse to survive.

06:53.429 --> 06:55.796
That's disgusting.

06:55.798 --> 06:58.165
It wasn't my horse.
The point is

06:58.167 --> 07:00.534
we're here now
eating coconut cake.

07:00.536 --> 07:02.770
Right civilized country.

07:06.224 --> 07:09.026
- <i>Mm!</i>
- <i>There's chicken</i> and cornbread.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.812
<i>I know it.
I'll attend to that cornbread directly.</i>

07:11.814 --> 07:14.065
There's a rider.

07:25.176 --> 07:28.795
Listen, cowboy, how about you
take your mother in the house?

07:28.797 --> 07:31.048
He's wearing a funny hat.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.366
I think it's your ranch hand,
Mr. Coffey.

07:33.368 --> 07:35.969
Anybody can wear a funny hat.
That ain't Sunday riding.

07:35.971 --> 07:38.338
Go on, take your mother inside.

07:38.340 --> 07:40.573
Let's go, Dobie.

07:42.426 --> 07:44.443
Go on.

07:57.691 --> 07:59.692
Coffey, God damn it,
I was having a picnic.

07:59.694 --> 08:02.160
Indians...
they killed...

08:03.330 --> 08:06.332
There.
It's from Mr. Clay.

08:06.334 --> 08:08.366
They took Maryanne,
took the whole family.

08:08.368 --> 08:10.768
I can read.

08:13.455 --> 08:16.207
Oh, Jesus.

08:16.209 --> 08:18.876
Did the Indians kill them
little Williams girls too?

08:18.878 --> 08:22.213
No, looks like Mr. Williams did.

08:22.215 --> 08:25.349
That's a hell of a thing to say.

08:27.519 --> 08:29.270
PARCHER: <i>If we're dealing
with crow or Ute,</i>

08:29.272 --> 08:32.107
<i>Dobie could see things a
boy shouldn't have to.</i>

08:32.109 --> 08:34.823
I've made up my mind, will.

08:34.826 --> 08:37.894
You've already lost
a man to the Indians.

08:37.895 --> 08:40.263
I don't want to risk another.

08:42.765 --> 08:44.534
I don't have a man in this house.

08:44.536 --> 08:48.005
I've got a boy.

08:48.007 --> 08:51.141
Take him to Washburn Creek
and bring him back.

08:51.143 --> 08:53.143
Maybe then I'll have two.

08:53.145 --> 08:55.912
- Them horses ready?
- Yes, sir.

08:55.914 --> 08:58.247
We're all set, Mr. Parcher.

08:58.249 --> 09:00.616
Then let's get to it.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.026
Mr. Parcher's lived
through everything

09:10.028 --> 09:11.978
this country could throw at him.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.430
You stay close and mind him.

09:14.432 --> 09:16.932
You'll be fine.

09:26.075 --> 09:28.109
- <i>(FLIES BUZZING)</i>
- Oh.

09:30.496 --> 09:32.363
<i>She should have bled out more.</i>

09:35.217 --> 09:37.552
Same with the girls.

09:37.554 --> 09:39.704
Ida and Daphne.

09:44.877 --> 09:47.412
I think those were their names.

09:49.564 --> 09:52.016
You want to wait outside?

09:52.018 --> 09:54.485
No.

09:54.487 --> 09:56.837
Good.

09:59.991 --> 10:01.609
I wonder

10:01.611 --> 10:03.977
what kind of weapon
makes a wound like that.

10:05.414 --> 10:07.748
<i>No scalping knife I know of.</i>

10:07.750 --> 10:11.351
<i>Maybe some kind of chisel.</i>

10:43.683 --> 10:46.050
That gun only fires twice.

10:47.887 --> 10:50.355
He would have had
to have reloaded it

10:50.357 --> 10:52.691
if he wanted to kill everybody.

10:54.961 --> 10:57.963
Any Christian woman would
prefer dying to capture.

10:57.965 --> 11:01.549
Mr. Williams had time to reload

11:01.551 --> 11:04.335
because his wife gave it to him.

11:04.337 --> 11:07.688
If it came to that,

11:07.690 --> 11:09.457
I hope you'd be strong enough

11:09.459 --> 11:12.025
to take care of your mother.

11:30.594 --> 11:33.996
I suppose a wild buffalo
could have done this.

11:37.068 --> 11:40.754
Looks like you've found yourself
a hole in the ground there, will.

11:40.756 --> 11:43.073
That and four corpses

11:43.075 --> 11:45.075
and six missing,

11:45.077 --> 11:47.727
most of those being
women and children.

11:47.729 --> 11:49.379
I'll get the horses.

11:49.381 --> 11:51.214
Hold up now.

11:51.216 --> 11:53.599
<i>It's in my command.</i>

11:53.601 --> 11:55.918
I gotta know who we're hunting.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.787
How long have the
Indians had them?

11:58.789 --> 12:00.556
Near a day now.

12:00.558 --> 12:03.225
Mm, well,

12:03.227 --> 12:05.727
that's more than enough time for
those women to have been...

12:05.729 --> 12:08.113
Yes, so why aren't
we on the trail?

12:08.115 --> 12:11.534
You want to go face an Indian
war party on your lonesome?

12:11.536 --> 12:15.204
Those blanketheads will peel
you like an orange, boy.

12:15.206 --> 12:18.222
Follow along.
We'll do this thing right.

12:18.224 --> 12:20.625
Don't worry.
We'll find them.

12:41.413 --> 12:45.215
Hey, you all right?

12:48.619 --> 12:52.522
We should be going after them.

12:52.524 --> 12:54.524
You knew these people?

12:54.526 --> 12:57.527
I do.

12:57.529 --> 12:59.462
The Stewarts anyway.

13:04.335 --> 13:06.620
That's Maryanne.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.374
She yours?

13:11.376 --> 13:13.909

14:28.500 --> 14:30.833
<i>That's ten bear, a crow Indian.</i>

14:30.835 --> 14:33.269

Hey, Walnut, Mr. Victor's
canteen's dry.

14:38.075 --> 14:40.076
He called you Walnut.

14:40.078 --> 14:42.545
Yeah, he did.

14:42.547 --> 14:44.914
Is that your name?

14:44.916 --> 14:47.383
The name's Callaghan.

14:47.385 --> 14:49.384
Callaghan.

14:49.386 --> 14:51.486
You Irish?

14:55.124 --> 14:57.693
That man that calls me Walnut
believes he's better than me

14:57.695 --> 14:59.995
'cause nobody ever owned him.

14:59.997 --> 15:02.247
But I'm not enlisted.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.299
I cook for fort Lincoln,
but I'm paid.

15:04.301 --> 15:07.301
I can leave anytime I want.
You understand?

15:07.303 --> 15:09.570
Sure.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.942
I'm Fergus Coffey.

15:16.944 --> 15:19.312

15:19.314 --> 15:21.482

15:24.336 --> 15:26.253
Damnation.

15:26.255 --> 15:28.255
What?

15:28.257 --> 15:32.059
We're not gonna find any kidnapped
wives at a reservation.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.561
I know it.

15:34.563 --> 15:36.596
We could set off on our own.

15:36.598 --> 15:38.965
Might could, though it
would only be four of us

15:38.967 --> 15:42.635
to we don't know how many 'skins.

15:42.637 --> 15:45.838
We have to find the Stewarts.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.142
<i>If we can do that with Henry
Victor's help... fine.</i> If not...

15:49.144 --> 15:51.661
I guess you've had every chance
to and ain't killed us yet.

15:51.663 --> 15:54.013
Whoa.
Whoa.

15:54.015 --> 15:55.514
Whoa. Whoa.

Mr. Parcher.

15:58.403 --> 16:00.720
Hey hey.

16:00.722 --> 16:02.422
Sorry, Dobie.

16:02.424 --> 16:04.339
<i>It must have stepped

16:05.909 --> 16:07.993
Listen, cowboy,

16:07.995 --> 16:09.995
why don't you hump on ahead

16:09.997 --> 16:12.864
and see how much further we're
gonna press on before camp?

16:12.866 --> 16:14.833
Yes, sir.

16:17.303 --> 16:19.271
Go on now.

16:22.575 --> 16:24.943
Why do you spend so much time
rubbing that boy's belly?

16:24.945 --> 16:27.446
He already thinks
you're Jesus Crockett.

16:29.681 --> 16:33.451
I'm courting his mother.

16:33.453 --> 16:36.204
<i>That's Gertrude Spikes' boy?</i>

16:36.206 --> 16:38.489
Yeah.

16:38.491 --> 16:40.924
A skinny woman.

16:40.926 --> 16:44.162
Might as well just poke the boy.

16:44.164 --> 16:46.531
(CHUCKLES)

16:48.933 --> 16:51.302
That's not a very godly sentiment.

16:51.304 --> 16:53.569
(CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY)

17:11.922 --> 17:15.942
- Hey, son.
- Mr. Victor, sir, Mr. Parcher told me...

Take a look yonder.

<i>Is that a horse?</i>
