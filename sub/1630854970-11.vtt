00:12.346 --> 00:13.764
- Hello, there.
- Hey, there.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.390
- Hi, Ted.
- Howdy.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.809
Hey, Ted. Good luck this weekend.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.269
I appreciate you, Susan.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.441
Hey, Ms. Barnaby. Rough night?

00:25.025 --> 00:28.028
Ted, if it's not rough, it isn't fun.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.448
Boy.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.159
- Hiya.
- Hey, fellas. How you doing?

00:35.244 --> 00:37.079
- What's up, Coach?
- There she is.

00:37.079 --> 00:41.333
Hey, wanker. Don't get all cocky
and fuck up that streak you're on.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.960
What streak?

00:42.960 --> 00:45.629
- Go Richmond.
- Yes, sir.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.090
Morning.

00:48.966 --> 00:49.967
Hey. How you doing?

00:55.347 --> 00:57.099
- Mom?
- Hey, Teddy.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.717
Don't think the cleaners
actually cleaned the floor.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.260
There are no cleaners.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.053
So, why do we put the chairs
on the tables?

01:35.053 --> 01:36.763
The patriarchy.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.475
Okay. Oh, well. I'll just go get a broom.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.441
Hello.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.777
We're not open for another half hour.
Would you care to wait not here?

01:50.777 --> 01:51.862
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

01:51.862 --> 01:52.946
No, wait.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.575
We're actually here to speak
with Nathan Shelley. He works here, yeah?

01:57.326 --> 01:58.327
No such man exists.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.790
Oh, my God, it's true.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.044
How did you go through your money so fast?

02:08.044 --> 02:09.630
Did you get addicted to the limelight?

02:09.630 --> 02:13.008
What? No. No, I just like working here.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.136
I like spending time with my girlfriend.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.805
She was right there.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.434
- That was my girlfriend. She--
- Okay.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.561
What are you guys doing here?

02:24.561 --> 02:26.313
We want you to come back to Richmond.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.611
- You do?
- Yeah, bruv.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.113
'Cause this shit here is sad as fuck.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.909
And all of you? You want me to come...

02:39.493 --> 02:41.703
Yeah. It'll be good to have you back.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.707
The whole team talked about it,
and it was unanimous.

02:45.707 --> 02:46.792
Except for Bumbercatch.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.295
Who abstained
because he's passionately antidemocratic.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.922
Oh, yeah.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.006
Yeah.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.468
So, what? Ted asked you guys
to come here to get me to come back?

02:56.468 --> 02:58.262
No, Ted doesn't know about it.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.974
Yeah, no, we wanted to ask you
to see if you wanted to come back

03:01.974 --> 03:03.517
before we approached Ted.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.935
Okay, well, sorry, guys.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.729
I don't think it's a good idea
for me to come back to Richmond, so...

03:07.729 --> 03:08.730
Thank you though.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.527
- Okay.
- Cool.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.779
Can I have 75 kebabs to go?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.449
Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, of course.
Chicken, pork or lamb?

03:21.952 --> 03:23.829
Or 25 of each?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.290
Nate the Great.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.834
- Yum.
- Okay.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.252
- Nice.
- Hey.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.379
Thank you!

03:42.973 --> 03:44.433
Pretty sparse.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.235
What are all these
crazy symbols on your oven dial?

03:55.861 --> 03:59.573
Yeah, well, the one with
the line under the nuclear power symbol,

03:59.573 --> 04:00.991
that's for making cookies and chicken.

04:00.991 --> 04:04.077
The three squiggly lines
let you burn a frozen pizza.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.330
And the key symbol there,
that makes the whole thing beep

04:06.330 --> 04:08.248
until Beard comes over
and fixes it for me.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.499
Is everything okay, Mom?

04:10.125 --> 04:11.293
Sure. I'm just looking around.

04:11.293 --> 04:14.463
No, no. No, I mean, you being here
in London. Is everything okay?

04:14.463 --> 04:16.089
Oh, yeah. Everything's fine.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.050
I just always wanted to see England,

04:18.050 --> 04:20.719
so I booked this trip
as a little Mother's Day gift to myself.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.181
Okay. Well, I mean,
how long you been here?

04:24.181 --> 04:26.808
- Just a week.
- A week? Where the heck you staying?

04:26.808 --> 04:28.560
This adorable little hostel.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.771
- Mom--
- Now, I met so many Australians.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.606
They are backpacking through Europe.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.650
So much sex.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.401
- Mom.
- No, not me.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.654
- The Australians.
- No, no, I get it. Okay.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.822
How about you stay here
for the rest of your trip, all right?

04:40.822 --> 04:42.366
Only if I'm not a hassle.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.535
You're not a hassle, Mom, okay?
Please stay here.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.161
- Okay.
- Okay, good. All right.

04:46.161 --> 04:49.039
- Now, look, I gotta get to work.
- All righty. Have fun.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.417
You wanna tag along?

04:52.417 --> 04:55.754
- Well, I don't wanna be in your hair.
- Mom, I want you in my hair. Okay?

04:55.754 --> 04:58.215
I want you in my friends'
and coworkers' hair.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.758
Now, please. Come on with.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.510
- Okay, thank you. I would like that.
- All right, good.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.303
You don't have to bring
your suitcase, Mom.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.056
- Okay. I'll just grab my coat...
- Yeah.

05:06.056 --> 05:10.435
...get my bag,
leave my worries on the doorstep.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.856
Yeah, just direct your feet that way,
Mom. Okay.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.322
Sam,
Richmond have won 15 matches in a row.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.199
With two games left,
you're just four points off

05:24.199 --> 05:26.451
Manchester City
for the Premier League title.

05:27.202 --> 05:30.873
- Do you have a question?
- Yeah. Am I dreaming?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.544
Well, if you are, please, don't wake up.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.588
And if this is the Matrix,
don't unplug me.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.300
Yeah, better Trent.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.094
Marcus Adebayo, <i>The Independent</i>.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.097
Jamie,
on the heels of making your England debut,

05:47.097 --> 05:49.433
how does it feel to be named
Premier League Player of the Month?

05:54.271 --> 05:56.398
Yeah. Yeah. It feels good, I guess.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.401
But it's really the team
making me look good.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.654
So, I should be doing a better job
of making them look good, really.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.991
So, yeah. Makes me feel bad.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.663
Jamie also led the league
in assists this month,

06:11.663 --> 06:14.416
so he's done plenty to make
his teammates look good.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.251
Yeah, but they're the ones
who took all the shots.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.753
He also scored a goal.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.255
That was meant to be a pass.
You shouldn't count that.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.885
That goal is a lie.
It should be retracted from the records.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.639
I apologize to everyone,
especially the kids.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.019
Right, let's call it there, everyone.
That was great. Thanks very much.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.650
- Hey, Boss.
- Hello, Ted.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.819
So this morning,
I don't just bring biscuits.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.447
I also have a very special surprise guest.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.450
How exciting.
To whom do I owe the pleasure?

06:48.450 --> 06:50.285
I'm Coach Lasso's new bodyguard.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.496
Please keep your hands
where I can see them.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.498
I'm just kidding.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.793
You can keep them well-manicured
mitts of yours wherever you like.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.420
Oh, my God. You're Ted's mother.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.964
Winner, winner, B. F. Skinner.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.802
Mom, this is my boss, Rebecca Welton.
Rebecca, this is Dottie Lasso.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.387
Honey, bring that in.

07:10.305 --> 07:13.433
I can't believe I'm finally getting
to meet the woman who created

07:13.433 --> 07:15.269
one of the nicest humans I've ever met.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.728
Oh, no, don't look at me.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.523
This one popped out and immediately
asked the doctor if he needed anything.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.234
That doesn't make any sense.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.945
Babies can't talk and nor do they
understand empathy. And you know...

07:24.945 --> 07:27.406
Dottie-- I'm sorry. May I call you Dottie?

07:27.406 --> 07:28.949
Sure, if you want me to respond.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.493
Right. If you'd like,
I'd love to show you around.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.996
I've heard great things
about the Sherlock Holmes Museum.

07:34.746 --> 07:35.873
I mean around the facility.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.542
Even better.
I can't wait to meet Dani Rojas.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.419
And he does not disappoint.

07:41.587 --> 07:42.963
- Shall we?
- Sure.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.632
- Where you from, honey?
- Surrey.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.467
Where are you from?

07:48.051 --> 07:50.554
- Surrey.
- I thought you said "sorry."

07:56.727 --> 07:57.728
So I say,

07:57.728 --> 07:59.688
"Officer, you must be mistaken.

07:59.688 --> 08:03.400
You couldn't have arrested my son.
My son is asleep in his own bed."

08:04.568 --> 08:07.196
Are you sure you do not want
a kebab, Mama Lasso?

08:07.196 --> 08:08.572
Oh, no, thank you, Dani.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.240
You are so polite.

08:11.992 --> 08:12.993
Okay, now bear with me.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.247
It must be so lovely
having your mother visiting, Ted.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.707
Oh, yeah. It's great.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.418
- Oklahoma.
- Oh, no. It's weird.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.128
Didn't tell me she was coming.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.047
Just showed up out of nowhere,
you know, like one of them

08:25.047 --> 08:27.925
weird eyebrow hairs I started getting
the day after I turned 40.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.177
That's what mothers do, Ted.

08:31.929 --> 08:35.599
So it turns out my 12-year-old son
was not asleep in his own room.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.851
He had taken our car for a joyride.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.480
Now, he was arrested
for driving on the wrong side of the road,

08:41.480 --> 08:43.774
so I guess he was destined
to live in England.

08:45.651 --> 08:49.029
Now, see, I wasn't 12. I was 15.
And the whole reason we got pulled over

08:49.029 --> 08:52.783
was 'cause Ronnie Fowch was throwing
gang signs at a cop car.

08:52.783 --> 08:55.202
Look, sometimes the truth can ruin
a perfectly good story.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.954
Yeah, you should work for the <i>Daily Mail</i>.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.834
Ted, if you can give your mom
one lovely moment,

09:02.501 --> 09:05.170
you know, a memory to take back home,
then you've won.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.507
Yeah, all right. Thanks, Boss.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.134
Right. I've got to go
and see a man about a horse.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.012
I didn't know girls said that
when they gotta pee.

09:14.763 --> 09:15.931
No, Ted, I'm buying a horse.

09:20.644 --> 09:24.314
Hey, did Teddy ever tell you about
the time he ate a candy bar made of poop?

09:25.482 --> 09:27.109
Okay, okay! All right.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.778
I think that's enough story time
with Mama Lasso, all right, fellas?

09:29.778 --> 09:32.322
Practice starts in twenty minutes.
Up you go.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.366
- Nice to meet you, Mama Lasso.
- Nice to meet you.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.909
Hey, Mom. I'll be right back.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.245
I'm gonna go change,
and then I'll take you out to the pitch.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.080
Okay, honey. I'll be here.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.126
Mrs. Lasso, I just wanted to
introduce myself. I'm Trent Crimm.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.961
- Hello, Trent.
- Hello.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.922
I was wondering if I could
just have a little chat with you about--

09:48.922 --> 09:50.549
Trent, your hair is fabulous.

09:50.549 --> 09:53.010
- It really is. It's just styling.
- Thank you. Thank you.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.264
Van Damme. You still gotta wear that mask?

09:57.848 --> 10:01.226
Yeah, I do, man. Or else I die.

10:06.023 --> 10:09.818
Between wearing that mask and death,
I choose death.

10:11.236 --> 10:15.240
- It does make you look very stupid.
- Oh, well. Thank you, Jan Maas.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.454
You wanna take a crack, Jamie?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.541
I think it's more important
to be safe than to look cool.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.591
Oi! Tartt.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.302
Boot room. Now!

10:39.723 --> 10:42.059
Somebody is in trouble.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.230
No. Shouting is Roy's love language.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.406
All right. Listen up.

10:56.406 --> 11:00.827
This is not the week for your mister
fucking humble, great teammate bullshit.

11:00.827 --> 11:04.581
We got City on Saturday,
so we need you to be the prickiest prick

11:04.581 --> 11:06.959
you've ever been
in your little prick life.

11:06.959 --> 11:09.211
You understand? So I don't want you--

11:15.050 --> 11:16.176
What is wrong?

11:16.176 --> 11:19.179
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.473
Are you fucking dying or some shit?

11:21.473 --> 11:24.977
No. No. I'm-- No. I'm just tired.

11:25.769 --> 11:29.314
But I can't sleep, and I can't eat.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.860
And I wash me hair,
but I don't use any conditioner anymore

11:32.860 --> 11:34.820
'cause I-- Like, what's the fucking point?

11:35.654 --> 11:38.323
I feel like the guy
in the Red Bull commercial

11:38.323 --> 11:41.076
who's pushing that big rock up the hill,

11:41.076 --> 11:43.161
but he's lost his wings.

11:43.161 --> 11:47.499
Roy, I feel like--
I feel like I've lost me wings, Roy.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.671
Where the fuck are my wings, Roy?

12:00.345 --> 12:03.640
Fuck.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.228
- Will?
- Yeah?

12:08.854 --> 12:10.230
You missed a good one.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.282
Oh, boy.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.951
...that you've ever seen. You know, I even...

12:22.951 --> 12:25.662
Oh, my God, Coach.
Our new striker looks just like your mom.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.830
That is my mom.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.917
I know, Ted. That was a joke.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.961
- Right.
- Hey, Ted. Got a sec?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.796
What is time, Higgs boson? What's up?

12:34.796 --> 12:35.923
So, this morning,

12:35.923 --> 12:39.176
a few of my little birdies
went to visit Nathan in his new job,

12:40.469 --> 12:42.888
waiting tables in Tooting.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.515
- Tooting?
- Tooting.

12:44.515 --> 12:46.600
- Did he just say "Tooting"?
- Tooting.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.977
- Y'all got a town here called "Tooting"?
- Tooting, yes.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.395
Man, this place is great, right?

12:51.230 --> 12:52.940
Yeah.
Sorry, what were you saying about Nate?

12:52.940 --> 12:57.194
The little birdies are pretty sure
he'd come back if invited.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.155
Uh-huh. Okay. What do you think?

13:00.155 --> 13:02.366
Well, I do believe in second chances, Ted.

13:02.366 --> 13:05.452
That's why I'm still married,
and all my sons are alive.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.789
Hey, Roy. Would it bother you
if we brought Nate back?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.082
No. I don't give a fuck.

13:10.749 --> 13:14.253
He's great at the shit I suck at.
Look, I've gotta go and do something.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.921
Okay. Everything all right?

13:15.921 --> 13:19.049
Yeah. I've just come down with a case
of the "none of your fucking business."

13:19.049 --> 13:21.760
Right, right. Okay. What about you, Coach?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.846
- You all right if Nate comes--
- If you bring that Judas back,

13:23.846 --> 13:26.390
I will burn this place
to the fucking ground.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.518
Ted?

13:29.518 --> 13:32.062
Is it true that you got onstage and danced
with Bruce Springsteen?

13:32.062 --> 13:33.605
No, that was Courteney Cox.

13:33.605 --> 13:36.358
What I did do was sing "Glory Days"
with a Bruce Springsteen cover band

13:36.358 --> 13:38.026
at my friend Scott Cinnamon's bar mitzvah.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.697
It was the bar mitzvah.
That's right. It was the bar mitzvah.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.490
- Is this your mom?
- Yeah.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.826
It is so nice to meet you.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.870
Friends don't shake hands. Friends hug.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.748
- Weirdo Beard-o!
- Lodi Dodi!

13:52.332 --> 13:54.626
Come on, bring it on in. There you go.

13:54.626 --> 13:58.130
- Trent, come along.
- <i>Lodi Dodi, she like to party</i>

13:58.130 --> 14:00.215
<i>She don't cause trouble
Don't bother nobody</i>

14:01.842 --> 14:04.094
- Some of us got a football team to coach!
- Whoo-hoo!

14:04.094 --> 14:06.180
<i>Lodi Dodi, she like to party</i>

14:06.180 --> 14:08.223
<i>She don't cause trouble
Don't bother nobody</i>

14:18.442 --> 14:21.820
Hello. Are you here about the pipes?

14:22.404 --> 14:24.656
No. What's wrong with the pipes?

14:25.532 --> 14:26.742
Nothing.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.953
That's why I thought it was so weird
that you were here about the pipes.

14:30.954 --> 14:34.124
Roy, what are you doing here?

14:34.124 --> 14:35.751
I need to talk.

14:40.631 --> 14:41.465
Roy...

14:41.465 --> 14:44.885
Oh, no. Not about us. I just...

14:47.262 --> 14:48.555
I need your help with Jamie.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.434
He's all fucked in the head.
And I've tried to do it myself,

14:52.434 --> 14:54.561
but it's all that emotional shit
you're good at.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.232
Also... you look nice.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.067
You want my help with Jamie?

15:00.067 --> 15:02.653
Yeah, and you look nice.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.575
Both of you.

15:10.327 --> 15:11.328
Thank you.

15:12.204 --> 15:15.707
This cost two pounds
from a car boot sale, so...

15:15.707 --> 15:17.000
All right.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.294
You know, thank you.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.889
This place is very charming.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.600
Reminds of this Irish bar
I went to in Topeka.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.769
Well, you probably don't wanna
share that with me.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.688
The Irish part or the Topeka part?

15:37.688 --> 15:39.231
Both, really.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.440
No! No!

15:43.986 --> 15:45.112
My turn. Excuse me.

15:48.866 --> 15:54.037
Trying to follow the yellow brick road,
where the dogs of society keep on howling.

15:54.037 --> 15:54.997
How's he doing?

15:54.997 --> 15:58.000
Well, I'm ahead,
but he's better set up for the multiball.

15:58.584 --> 16:01.170
No, silly pants. How's he doing?

16:04.256 --> 16:05.883
Well, he's Ted.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.843
Still running around in circles,

16:07.843 --> 16:11.972
making sure everybody's okay without
accepting a drop of help for himself.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.016
Pretty much. How you doing, Dottie?

16:15.017 --> 16:16.226
Don't you worry about me.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.980
Nah, y'all got enough cooking without
putting my troubles on your to-do list.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.192
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Mae.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.276
Cheers, Mae.

16:25.611 --> 16:28.488
Mae, your pub is wonderful.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.116
It's nothing like
that Irish place in Topeka.

16:32.618 --> 16:33.785
I'll take your word for it.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.207
So, you seeing anyone?

16:39.333 --> 16:41.835
Had my heart ripped out of my chest,
stomped into a pulp,

16:41.835 --> 16:44.379
and dragged through the town square
for everyone to ridicule.

16:44.379 --> 16:47.007
Sweetie.
That's okay, you'll meet somebody.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.091
No, I'm in love.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.221
- Here. Wanna see a picture?
- Sure.

16:53.639 --> 16:55.015
Your mum's a peach.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.559
Oh, yeah. I-- Thanks.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.772
Here, I'll swap with you. There you are.

17:01.772 --> 17:05.692
You know, Ted, pinball is a lot more fun
if you use an actual ball.

17:08.444 --> 17:12.782
Yeah. Well, I-- You know, I was letting
Coach and my mom catch up a little.

17:12.782 --> 17:13.867
That's all.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.874
"They fuck you up, your mum and dad.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.460
They may not mean to, but they do.

17:25.002 --> 17:30.551
They fill you with the faults they had
and add some extra just for you.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.513
But they were fucked up in their turn

17:35.097 --> 17:38.308
by fools in old-style hats and coats,

17:39.768 --> 17:44.106
who half the time were soppy-stern
and half at one another's throats.

17:46.650 --> 17:49.361
Man hands on misery to man.

17:49.862 --> 17:52.030
It deepens like a coastal shelf.

17:54.157 --> 17:58.328
Get out as early as you can
and don't have any kids yourself."

18:08.213 --> 18:11.300
Hey, Ted. Your mum's the bollocks.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.968
We just became friends on Facebook.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.928
I didn't know you were almost
the drummer in Coldplay.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.346
Oh, yeah. It's true. It's true.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.140
It's amazing. It's incredible!

18:20.475 --> 18:21.476
No way.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.694
I can't take your bed, Teddy.

18:30.694 --> 18:33.405
Mom, it's okay, all right?
I'll just sleep on the couch.

18:33.405 --> 18:36.033
- No, I'll sleep on the couch.
- Well, then I'm gonna sleep

18:36.033 --> 18:38.785
on the floor next to the couch,
and neither of us are gonna use the bed.

18:38.785 --> 18:39.828
Please.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.706
- Thank you.
- Okay.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.043
- Not on the bed.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

18:46.627 --> 18:47.961
Hey, I brought you something.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.339
What? On the off chance
we'd bump into each other?

18:50.339 --> 18:52.966
No, it's your clippings from back home.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.224
I thought you'd want those.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.228
I appreciate it.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.189
So, what's your plan tomorrow?

19:07.856 --> 19:09.691
Yeah, do you wanna come
to Manchester with us?

19:09.691 --> 19:11.235
I don't know.

19:11.235 --> 19:13.737
I mean, coming all the way to England
and not seeing a soccer match

19:13.737 --> 19:16.073
is kind of like going to Rome
and not going to church

19:16.073 --> 19:17.241
or getting your pocket picked.

19:17.866 --> 19:20.410
Well, thank you,
but I think I'll just stay here.

19:20.410 --> 19:23.664
I didn't get much sleep last week,
what with all that noisy sex from--

19:23.664 --> 19:25.207
- not me-- the Australians.
- The Australians.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.875
- Yes, no, I remember.
- Yeah. Exactly.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.545
And you know how nervous I get
when I'm watching your games.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.380
So I think I'll just stay put

19:31.380 --> 19:34.091
and let you go beat the pants
off those Manchesterians.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.384
Mancunians.

19:35.384 --> 19:38.303
And then I'll have a home-cooked meal
waiting for you when you get back.

19:38.303 --> 19:39.471
It's been too long.

19:40.055 --> 19:43.433
Yeah. No, that'll be nice. Okay.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.895
Well, then I'll see you in the morning.

19:47.938 --> 19:48.939
Hey--

19:51.275 --> 19:54.278
Are you still having those episodes?

19:55.445 --> 19:58.490
- You know.
- The panic attacks.

19:58.490 --> 19:59.700
Yeah.

20:01.493 --> 20:03.579
No, no. Not recently.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.708
You know, I've actually been
talking to this therapist.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.710
Let me guess. It's all my fault.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.796
No, Mom. No, of course not. No, but--

20:14.631 --> 20:16.550
Well, I mean, It's really helped.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.177
Good, good, good, good, good, good.

20:18.177 --> 20:21.180
Yeah. You ever thought
about talking to someone?

20:21.180 --> 20:25.434
Oh, no. That is not my cup of tea.
And you know I love my tea.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.062
Good night, Mom.

20:29.062 --> 20:32.482
Good night, sweetie.
Thank you for the bed.

20:33.192 --> 20:34.193
You're welcome.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.668
Hey, hot dog. Y'all joining us today?

20:51.668 --> 20:54.046
- Well, we're all in this together, Ted.
- Yeah.

20:54.046 --> 20:56.298
I also received
a strongly worded text from Nora

20:56.298 --> 20:58.175
demanding I stop using my private jet.

20:58.175 --> 20:59.259
Why?

20:59.259 --> 21:01.512
- The environment.
- Oh, yeah.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.097
- Goddamn environment.
- Yeah.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.390
Yep.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.475
All right.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.273
Hi.

21:14.191 --> 21:15.776
- Hey.
- How's he doing?

21:23.450 --> 21:25.077
Fucking hell.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.203
I'll talk to him.

21:27.788 --> 21:28.789
Right.

21:29.790 --> 21:34.920
Ladies and gentlemen.
Let our journey commence.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.758
Look at Ken.
Boy, he cleans up nice, don't he?

21:39.758 --> 21:41.677
- You should see him in drag.
- Really?

21:45.222 --> 21:47.015
There you go. Well take your time.

21:47.015 --> 21:50.310
And while you wait, do snack on some nuts.
And I'll be back with your drinks.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.311
- All right?
- Thank you.

21:51.311 --> 21:54.773
Hey, hey. Oi, oi, oi.
Do you know who this is?

21:54.773 --> 21:56.233
Your son?

21:56.817 --> 21:58.151
What? No.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.653
Our waiter?

21:59.653 --> 22:03.740
Bloody hell, you two are a right pair.
No, I mean do you know who he was?

22:03.740 --> 22:05.450
I don't know.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.494
Only the manager of West Ham United.

22:08.871 --> 22:11.164
Right. You're the Wonder Kid.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.125
Yes, that's it. I said Wonder Kid.

22:13.125 --> 22:17.212
This man right here went
from kit man to assistant coach,

22:17.212 --> 22:21.592
to manager, to top of the league,
and now he's my head waiter.

22:22.801 --> 22:23.802
I'm so sorry.

22:24.678 --> 22:26.263
Anyway, nice talking to you.

22:27.014 --> 22:29.683
Please try the fish.
We've got a ton of it out back.

22:29.683 --> 22:32.394
- All right. Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish.
- Yep, yep.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.731
Was it drugs? I done drugs. I get it.

22:35.731 --> 22:38.442
No, no. No, I just like working here.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.028
And that's my girlfriend.

22:43.322 --> 22:46.116
Anyway, enjoy the nuts.
I'll go and get your drinks, okay?

22:47.910 --> 22:49.077
Definitely drugs.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.329
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

22:51.330 --> 22:52.497
But which ones?

23:13.936 --> 23:15.062
Hi.

23:15.062 --> 23:16.188
Hey.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.106
Can I come in?

23:18.690 --> 23:19.566
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.902
Come in. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, what's up, yeah?

23:24.112 --> 23:25.948
I just wanted to come
and see how you're doing.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.450
Roy told you.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.412
Well, he's worried about you.
Is that okay?

23:33.205 --> 23:34.915
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

23:34.915 --> 23:37.584
I'm fine. I'm good. I'm great.

23:37.584 --> 23:41.213
In fact,
I think I'm the best that I've ever been.

23:41.964 --> 23:42.965
You know?

23:45.759 --> 23:49.179
There's something so sad about a suitcase.
Do you know what I mean? It's like--

23:51.473 --> 23:54.643
It's like a drawer without a home.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.774
Hey, Jamie. Look at me.

24:01.525 --> 24:04.862
- You've got a lot going on right now.
- There's a lot going on, yeah.

24:04.862 --> 24:07.739
This is the first time you've played
back home since you left.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.325
The crowd's gonna hate you.

24:10.325 --> 24:13.871
And the person who's gonna be booing
the loudest in the crowd is your dad.

24:13.871 --> 24:15.497
I didn't think of that. Yeah.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.000
And I know a lot of people
are shit-talking your hair online.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.919
- They're what?
- No! Think about it.

24:20.919 --> 24:22.588
If you guys win tomorrow,

24:22.588 --> 24:26.675
then you will be on the precipice
of achieving everything

24:26.675 --> 24:27.926
that you've ever dreamed of.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.138
- Oh, my God.
- Shit!

24:31.138 --> 24:32.264
Sorry, Jamie.

24:51.575 --> 24:52.576
Here.

24:53.577 --> 24:54.578
Cheers.

24:56.038 --> 24:57.331
How'd it go with Jamie?

24:57.331 --> 24:59.249
Yeah, I fucked it. I made it worse.

24:59.875 --> 25:01.877
Shit.

25:03.712 --> 25:04.796
Hello, Roy and Keeley.

25:04.796 --> 25:08.175
Good to see you both
next to each other like before.

25:08.175 --> 25:11.386
No.
We're just sitting together as friends.

25:11.887 --> 25:13.263
Yeah, and she just looks very nice.

25:14.932 --> 25:16.475
Nora Ephron.

25:17.059 --> 25:19.144
- I'm saying my apology.
- Who?

25:19.144 --> 25:20.562
Carl Bernstein's ex.

25:38.705 --> 25:43.710
<i>Don't cry, Shop Girl. Don't cry.</i>

25:47.339 --> 25:48.757
<i>I wanted it to be you.</i>

25:51.218 --> 25:54.304
<i>I wanted it to be you so badly.</i>

26:19.621 --> 26:22.124
I mean, <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> is still
a far superior film.

26:22.124 --> 26:23.542
- Not now.
- I'm just saying.

26:29.756 --> 26:30.757
Whoo!

26:33.260 --> 26:35.846
All right. Listen up, you big softies.

26:35.846 --> 26:38.640
10:00 p.m., lights out.
Then get yourselves some beauty sleep

26:38.640 --> 26:40.350
for tomorrow's big meet-cute
with Man City,

26:40.350 --> 26:41.476
- you hear?
- Whoo!

26:41.476 --> 26:43.145
All right, "Ephron" on three.
One, two, three!

26:43.145 --> 26:44.688
- Ephron!
- There you go.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.024
- That was Dave Chappelle.
- Yeah.

26:47.024 --> 26:48.942
Not bad, yeah?
Hey, y'all seen that before?

26:48.942 --> 26:50.986
- First time? First time, yeah?
- First time.

26:50.986 --> 26:52.404
It's a goody. It was a goody.

26:52.404 --> 26:55.157
You gotta see <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>,
though. You know, this is why...

28:15.362 --> 28:16.530
The fuck is he?

28:16.530 --> 28:17.906
I don't know. You've lost him.

28:18.407 --> 28:21.034
- You said he went down here.
- I did not. You said that.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.328
No. I said he's in a tunnel,

28:23.328 --> 28:26.248
- I didn't say he was in this tunnel.
- Well, there's no other tunnel, is there?

28:26.748 --> 28:29.001
I don't believe it.
You've lost Jamie Tartt.

28:29.001 --> 28:31.420
- You can't lose Jamie Tartt.
- Well, you have.

28:32.087 --> 28:34.298
- Fucking hell!
- Why are you following me?

28:34.298 --> 28:36.383
Just wanted to make sure you're okay,
you prick.

28:37.467 --> 28:40.137
What's going on, Jamie?
Are you buying drugs?

28:43.849 --> 28:44.933
Come on.

28:55.235 --> 28:57.404
- Are you joking? Oi!
- How'd you miss?

28:59.114 --> 29:01.700
- Are you Jamie Tartt?
- Yeah.

29:02.326 --> 29:03.410
More like Jamie Fart.

29:03.410 --> 29:06.121
- Screw you, dickhead! Prick!
- Yeah, who are you?

29:06.121 --> 29:07.831
City's gonna fuck you up tomorrow.

29:07.831 --> 29:09.666
Yeah, you spaz. You little twat!

29:09.666 --> 29:11.877
- Yeah, it's not for you, pussy!
- Yeah, go on!

29:11.877 --> 29:13.879
- Walk. Bye!
- Bye.

29:13.879 --> 29:15.297
I smell your bum from here.

29:19.843 --> 29:21.011
Good lads.

29:21.011 --> 29:23.222
Oh, my gosh!

29:23.222 --> 29:24.890
- That was sick!
- Come on!

29:24.890 --> 29:27.226
- Yes, yes!
- Yeah! Come on!

29:31.939 --> 29:34.858
Hey! Jamie!

29:34.858 --> 29:36.109
How you doing, Simon?

29:36.109 --> 29:39.112
- This is Keeley, that's Roy.
- Come on in, come on in.

29:39.112 --> 29:41.573
- How are you, mate? Good seeing you, man.
- Yeah, great.

29:41.573 --> 29:42.616
- Hi!
- Hello.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.201
Hello.

29:45.786 --> 29:47.746
Georgie, we've got visitors.

29:48.247 --> 29:50.457
What was that, love? Someone at the door?

29:54.211 --> 29:55.212
Hello, Mommy.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.507
Jamie!

29:59.341 --> 30:02.845
Mommy, I'd like to introduce you
to Keeley, and this hairy prick's Roy.

30:02.845 --> 30:04.596
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

30:04.596 --> 30:07.349
Hi! It's lovely to finally meet you both.

30:07.349 --> 30:09.810
I'd come and give you a hug,
but I'm not letting go of this one.

30:12.271 --> 30:13.272
There they go.

30:13.772 --> 30:16.066
Right, who wants some sweet treats?

30:16.066 --> 30:18.485
Look at your gorgeous face. I love it.

30:19.194 --> 30:21.655
- How have you been? Look at you.
- Mom. You look...

30:23.574 --> 30:26.743
It was just poopy.
You know, it really upset me.

30:27.536 --> 30:30.747
This guy on Twitter,
he kept saying that it was blonde,

30:30.747 --> 30:34.126
but I'm like,
"It's fucking walnut mist, mate."

30:34.126 --> 30:35.961
- Yeah, obviously.
- Yeah.

30:35.961 --> 30:38.046
He's done a lovely job. It's dead natural.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.094
- What do you think?
- It's really yummy.

30:45.012 --> 30:47.931
- Hey.
- It's fucking delicious.

30:48.599 --> 30:52.436
Well, it's a Paul Hollywood recipe,
but I've gone a little bit rogue on it.

30:53.145 --> 30:54.438
- Right.
- Babes,

30:55.022 --> 30:57.191
do you wanna give Roy and Keeley
the grand tour?

30:57.691 --> 30:58.859
Show them around a bit.

30:58.859 --> 31:01.361
Yes! Good idea. Thank-- Oops!

31:02.738 --> 31:05.824
Right, follow me. We will start
in the kitchen, aka my laboratory.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.620
I've just got a new bain-marie,
and it's copperplated.

31:10.204 --> 31:12.581
Wow. What does that mean?
It sounds expensive.

31:17.419 --> 31:20.589
Have you ever considered doing
a happy hour at the Taste of Athens?

31:21.423 --> 31:24.801
I've literally never thought about work
the second after leaving work.

31:24.801 --> 31:26.428
Or even while there, really.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.853
I don't think you should work
there anymore.

31:35.729 --> 31:37.564
Why? I'm a great waiter.

31:38.065 --> 31:41.276
Yes.
It's weird how great of a waiter you are.

31:44.404 --> 31:47.324
But you're a coach.
They want you back at Richmond.

31:48.617 --> 31:49.743
You should go.

31:52.996 --> 31:55.457
Thing is, it didn't really end
too well for me there.

31:56.124 --> 32:00.420
I think a lot of that was my fault.
Well, it was all my fault.

32:02.089 --> 32:04.383
Look, after this season,
I'll try and get another coaching job,

32:04.383 --> 32:06.593
just not at Richmond, okay?

32:08.762 --> 32:11.723
I will. I promise. I just-- Yeah.

32:16.353 --> 32:18.897
Yeah? You hungry? Do you want food?

32:21.108 --> 32:23.986
Dunno. Can I have some nuts
while I think about it?

32:25.320 --> 32:27.072
Right. Where are they?

32:28.031 --> 32:30.367
Here's the genius behind the nuts, okay?

32:31.368 --> 32:34.162
They make people thirsty. Yeah?

32:34.162 --> 32:39.126
I'm giving away, what, five p on nuts
and taking in five quid on beer.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.587
That's smart. Right?

32:42.588 --> 32:44.631
Why am I the only person
thinking about this stuff?

32:46.758 --> 32:47.759
You doing all right?

32:49.469 --> 32:51.805
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.101
Okay.

32:58.478 --> 33:01.398
Come on. Out with it.

33:07.571 --> 33:08.572
You heard from Dad?

33:09.531 --> 33:10.616
No.

33:11.450 --> 33:13.785
Haven't heard from that
human ball sack in ages.

33:15.787 --> 33:16.788
You?

33:17.956 --> 33:19.208
No, not since Wembley.

33:24.087 --> 33:26.965
Thought I was finally rid of him, but...

33:31.345 --> 33:33.722
...I always did what I did...

33:36.600 --> 33:38.936
because fuck him, you know?

33:38.936 --> 33:42.147
And now that I don't give a shit
about him, it's like...

33:49.238 --> 33:51.990
You know when some guys
can't make their willies go hard?

33:53.325 --> 33:54.451
You mean impotent?

33:55.077 --> 33:57.079
Yeah. It's like I got that, but...

33:59.957 --> 34:01.583
but it's like I got it in--

34:04.461 --> 34:06.004
It's like I got it in my soul.

34:12.761 --> 34:17.766
And here is the main attraction.
Jamie's room.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.320
- Fucking hell.
- Yes.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.822
Many posters have come and gone
over the years.

34:32.822 --> 34:35.284
Henry, Gerrard, Ronaldo.

34:36.326 --> 34:38.411
But Roy Kent always remains.

34:40.706 --> 34:42.291
Meat pies are done. Excuse me.

34:46.253 --> 34:47.920
Fucking hell.

34:50.299 --> 34:51.300
Jamie...

34:54.594 --> 34:58.932
your father, he is who he is.

35:00.976 --> 35:04.521
And he is never, ever, ever gonna change.

35:06.773 --> 35:07.900
And like it or not,

35:08.400 --> 35:11.653
you've ended up being who you are
so that you can prove him wrong.

35:15.365 --> 35:16.617
And you are amazing.

35:20.329 --> 35:21.705
You are.

35:27.211 --> 35:29.004
When you come on for England...

35:32.925 --> 35:35.177
Jesus, Jamie, I wept.

35:36.970 --> 35:38.805
I bawled me fucking eyes out.

35:44.895 --> 35:49.441
And, yeah,
your dad will be in the stands tomorrow,

35:49.441 --> 35:51.818
pissed out of his head,
rooting against you.

35:54.655 --> 35:55.906
And it won't matter.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.996
You don't have anything to prove
to that toerag.

36:11.630 --> 36:15.759
You're not lost, my sexy little baby.

36:19.555 --> 36:24.101
You're just not sure
which direction you're going in yet.

36:38.282 --> 36:40.909
This is fucking weird.

36:42.452 --> 36:45.622
There's a lot of weird to choose from.
Can you be more specific?

36:48.834 --> 36:49.835
You and me...

36:52.296 --> 36:54.715
sitting on Jamie Tartt's childhood bed...

36:57.009 --> 37:00.637
being all fucking concerned
about him and shit.

37:03.557 --> 37:08.061
Yeah. Good on us, Roy-o.

37:09.271 --> 37:10.439
Thanks, bud.

37:10.939 --> 37:12.524
You're welcome, pal.

37:16.403 --> 37:17.613
I don't wanna be friends.

37:19.740 --> 37:22.576
- You don't?
- Uh-uh.

37:23.827 --> 37:27.206
I don't wanna be just friends.

37:37.299 --> 37:38.675
Roy--

37:38.675 --> 37:40.385
Well, guys,
I think we should probably get--

37:44.848 --> 37:45.974
- You good to go?
- Yeah.

37:46.975 --> 37:47.976
Yeah.

37:48.769 --> 37:49.770
Right.

38:00.697 --> 38:02.115
- I love you.
- I love you.

38:02.115 --> 38:04.159
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

38:04.743 --> 38:05.911
Right.

38:05.911 --> 38:07.371
Hey, listen to me.

38:07.371 --> 38:10.165
I don't care
if you lose by ten goals tomorrow.

38:10.165 --> 38:12.793
I just want you to be happy. Okay, Son?

38:13.752 --> 38:16.213
Okay. Love you, Mommy.

38:17.130 --> 38:18.257
I love you.

38:19.716 --> 38:22.135
- See you soon.
- See you soon. All right, come on.

38:22.135 --> 38:24.263
- Off you go. Go home.
- All right. Bye.

38:25.055 --> 38:26.473
It was great to meet you.

38:27.057 --> 38:28.183
Bye.

38:28.183 --> 38:30.936
- One for the road.
- This way, babe.

38:30.936 --> 38:33.021
See you later. Love-- Love you.

38:39.152 --> 38:42.155
We should go and have cocktails.

38:51.164 --> 38:55.210
<i>...the latest in workout technology

38:56.253 --> 38:59.089

<i>Without a dream in my heart

40:03.237 --> 40:06.657
Richmond should have a classic old song
for our fans to sing.

40:07.366 --> 40:11.203
We did. When Freddie Mercury
briefly owned the team in 1980,

40:11.203 --> 40:13.830
he tried to make "Fat Bottomed Girls"
the team anthem.

40:14.498 --> 40:17.251
- Didn't work out.
- Did a bunch of people get offended?

40:17.251 --> 40:19.753
Just the flat-bottomed girls really.

40:19.753 --> 40:21.004
Yeah.

40:21.004 --> 40:23.340
My father went to art school
with Freddie Mercury.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.716
What?

40:24.716 --> 40:29.263
I mean, everyone always talks
about his amazing four-octave vocal range.

40:29.263 --> 40:31.265
But my father always insisted

40:31.265 --> 40:34.852
that if you actually asked Freddie
what his greatest talent was,

40:34.852 --> 40:36.770
he would've said flipping straights.

40:38.772 --> 40:41.525
- Come on, Richmond!
- You lads still have a way!

40:44.611 --> 40:46.446
Hey! Hey!

40:46.446 --> 40:49.324
Hey, thanks for saving us a seat.
How long have you been waiting?

40:49.324 --> 40:51.034
Mae let me sleep here last night.

40:51.034 --> 40:53.871
- How many beers do you want?
- Three, Mae.

40:54.538 --> 40:57.958
How many beers do you want
if you can't order again before halftime?

40:58.625 --> 40:59.751
- Twelve.
- Twelve.

41:00.335 --> 41:04.006
<i>Welcome, everyone. Today,
Manchester City hosts AFC Richmond.</i>

41:04.006 --> 41:09.136

<i>Perhaps not the homecoming

41:30.824 --> 41:31.742
Oh, boy.

41:31.742 --> 41:35.454
Come on, Son. That's it, that's it.
Fucking bastards.

41:35.454 --> 41:37.998
<i>City can clinch the title

41:37.998 --> 41:41.335
A loss makes things
very interesting next week.

41:41.335 --> 41:45.464
We find out in 90 minutes that starts now.

41:51.637 --> 41:52.721
<i>Clattered!</i>

41:52.721 --> 41:55.015
<i>Tartt can expect a lot of that today.</i>

42:03.148 --> 42:06.777
Here are some complimentary nuts.
And I'll be back to get your drinks. Okay?

42:07.486 --> 42:11.156
<i>Physical play from City
as Tartt pushes Richmond forward.</i>

42:12.157 --> 42:14.910
- <i>Tartt has options.</i>
- Colin's open.

42:17.162 --> 42:19.331
<i>A nifty move finds Bumbercatch.</i>

42:19.331 --> 42:22.042
<i>The Swiss crosses to the far post. Hughes!</i>

42:22.668 --> 42:24.378
- <i>The match has barely begun...</i>
- Yes.

42:24.378 --> 42:29.424
<i>...and the Welshman fires the Greyhounds
into the lead with a commanding header.</i>

42:29.424 --> 42:30.843
There we go.

42:30.843 --> 42:34.346
<i>That goal was all down to Tartt.
He's seeing two passes ahead.</i>

42:34.346 --> 42:37.474
<i>Brilliant play indeed
from the unsinkable Jamie Tartt.</i>

42:37.474 --> 42:42.271
<i>Colin Hughes with the exclamation point,
and Richmond leads 1-nil.</i>

42:48.318 --> 42:49.319
Yes!

42:51.196 --> 42:52.573
Leslie, what you doing?

42:52.573 --> 42:55.284
I'll celebrate
when the final whistle has blown.

42:55.284 --> 42:57.077
I don't wanna move and jinx it.

42:58.370 --> 42:59.371
Okay.

43:03.709 --> 43:05.919
<i>With the great Pep Guardiola
at the controls,</i>

43:05.919 --> 43:09.131
<i>rest assured,
City won't be quaking in their boots.</i>

43:09.131 --> 43:11.925
What's this sharp-dressed son of a gun
got cookin' now, huh?

43:11.925 --> 43:13.010
Go.

43:13.010 --> 43:15.512
<i>We know Pep will make
the right adjustments. He always does.</i>

43:15.512 --> 43:16.597
Hold on tight.

43:17.306 --> 43:18.432
All right! Here we go!

43:18.432 --> 43:22.728
<i>Halftime approaches, and the
Premier League title remains undecided.</i>

43:24.271 --> 43:27.357
<i>Jamie Tartt's hometown fans
are still letting him have it.</i>

43:28.400 --> 43:31.236
<i>City continuing to target
Richmond's number nine.</i>

43:31.236 --> 43:34.031
<i>Case in point,
as Tartt is knocked off the ball.</i>

43:38.076 --> 43:39.953
<i>And here comes City.</i>

43:39.953 --> 43:43.999
<i>De Villardi shoots!
Van Damme makes a terrific save.</i>

43:46.543 --> 43:50.130
<i>City making Tartt fight
for every inch out there.</i>

43:52.382 --> 43:54.968
Piss off back down South, pretty boy!

43:54.968 --> 43:58.180
<i>Tough crowd, Jamie Tartt. Tough crowd.</i>

43:58.764 --> 44:00.265
<i>We're in the 65th minute.</i>

44:00.265 --> 44:03.560
And since Richmond's early goal,
it's been one-way traffic.

44:03.560 --> 44:08.398
<i>City asking plenty of questions,
but so far Richmond are not listening.</i>

44:10.943 --> 44:13.070
<i>Oh, a sliver of space for De Villardi.</i>

44:13.654 --> 44:15.489
<i>Is this the equalizer?</i>

44:15.489 --> 44:19.451
<i>No! A swashbuckling save
by the masked Canadian.</i>

44:19.451 --> 44:20.911
<i>Van damn he's been good today!</i>

44:20.911 --> 44:22.287
Come on!

44:22.287 --> 44:23.372
Yeah!

44:23.372 --> 44:25.832
<i>Nearing the 80-minute mark,</i>

44:25.832 --> 44:27.459
<i>Richmond are defending
their one-goal lead.</i>

44:29.378 --> 44:31.213
<i>Ndour takes the corner.</i>

44:31.213 --> 44:34.466
<i>Van Damme races off his line to punch,
but it finds Elokobi.</i>

44:34.466 --> 44:36.218
<i>De Villardi has an open goal.</i>

44:36.218 --> 44:39.388
- <i>Jamie Tartt soars to clear the danger!</i>
- Yes, Jamie!

44:40.889 --> 44:41.890
Yes, Jamie!

44:42.558 --> 44:46.311
<i>Oh, no. It looks like Tartt
is in quite a bit of pain.</i>

44:46.895 --> 44:48.105
<i>It's his ankle, Arlo.</i>

44:48.105 --> 44:51.024
- <i>He landed on it wrong.</i>
- Get up, you soft prick!

44:53.652 --> 44:54.653
Come on.

44:54.653 --> 44:55.988
Is he okay?

44:56.488 --> 44:57.489
Let's go.

45:00.284 --> 45:01.410
Roberts! Get warm.

45:01.910 --> 45:03.453
- I'm good, good. Go, bro. Go, go.
- You good?

45:07.291 --> 45:10.169
Now, hold on. He's up, he's up, he's up. Okay.

45:10.169 --> 45:12.045
<i>It appears he'll give it a go.</i>

45:12.045 --> 45:15.757
<i>Good news for Richmond, who
can ill afford to play without their star.</i>

45:15.757 --> 45:18.093
<i>Not with this much at stake.</i>

45:24.641 --> 45:26.059
<i>We may have spoken too soon, Chris.</i>

45:26.059 --> 45:30.439
<i>Tartt tried to soldier on, but now he's in
some distress and may require attention.</i>

45:30.439 --> 45:31.523
Oh, my God.

45:38.071 --> 45:39.114
Up you go.

45:39.990 --> 45:41.158
Get you on the walk.

45:41.742 --> 45:43.410
Fudge.

45:50.834 --> 45:52.085
- We're finished. We're done.
- Come on.

45:52.085 --> 45:53.795
- We're done.
- Come on, James.

45:56.757 --> 45:58.967
Roberts! You're going in.

45:58.967 --> 46:00.594
Whoa, hold on, hold on. Hey, hey,

46:00.594 --> 46:02.304
hey, don't hop out there
quite yet, Tan, okay?

46:02.888 --> 46:05.224
- Coach, we're a man down.
- I know, Coach. Just give me one second.

46:06.725 --> 46:08.852
Hey, Jamie, are you sure
you can't get back out there?

46:10.187 --> 46:11.396
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

46:11.396 --> 46:12.689
No.

46:12.689 --> 46:14.191
- Hey, Coach!
- Yeah.

46:14.191 --> 46:15.567
You wanna play with ten men?

46:15.567 --> 46:18.237
Heck yeah! Right?

46:18.946 --> 46:20.739
We're just gonna wait and see, okay?

46:21.657 --> 46:23.283
And we'll check in on you, all right?

46:23.283 --> 46:26.495
You two, do me a favor. Heal him.
Use all your tricks, please.

46:28.163 --> 46:30.666
Okay. Yeah.
We're gonna give him a couple minutes.

46:30.666 --> 46:33.544
- He's gonna be fine. Here we go. Come on!
- <i>Ted Lasso elects to wait,</i>

46:33.544 --> 46:37.089
<i>leaving ten Greyhounds
against City's mighty 11.</i>

46:37.714 --> 46:39.591
<i>City looking for the equalizer.</i>

46:39.591 --> 46:42.845
<i>And Orellano shoots.
Van Damme is there! And there again!</i>

46:44.137 --> 46:45.430
<i>And again!</i>

46:45.430 --> 46:48.851
<i>There's just no penetrating
the mask of Van Damme!</i>

46:48.851 --> 46:51.186
<i>With his team facing relentless pressure,</i>

46:51.186 --> 46:52.980
<i>Ted Lasso is gambling with each</i>

46:52.980 --> 46:55.232
- <i>passing second he plays with a man down.</i>
- I'm gonna need a word, Nate.

46:55.232 --> 46:56.608
- In my office, yeah?
- Yeah.

46:56.608 --> 46:59.236
<i>I love gambling. Makes me feel alive.</i>

46:59.236 --> 47:01.530
<i>You should probably talk
to somebody about that, Chris.</i>

47:02.698 --> 47:05.200
Hello, mate. Come in. Take a seat.

47:06.201 --> 47:07.119
Here we go.

47:11.498 --> 47:12.791
Am I getting promoted?

47:13.500 --> 47:14.710
Nate, I gotta let you go.

47:16.879 --> 47:19.131
- Was it 'cause I was watching telly?
- No.

47:19.131 --> 47:20.465
I'm not pushing desserts hard enough?

47:20.465 --> 47:22.885
No, no, no. It's nothing you've done.

47:22.885 --> 47:27.764
You're my top man. You're on time,
you don't steal, you're sober.

47:28.265 --> 47:30.517
You're like my little unicorn.
You know what I mean?

47:31.268 --> 47:35.522
And it breaks my heart to say this,
but Jade said if I didn't fire you,

47:35.522 --> 47:37.024
she was gonna report me to the--

47:37.941 --> 47:40.027
Well, I can't say who,
because then you'd know what I've done.

47:40.027 --> 47:43.739
But my hands are tied. You gotta go.

47:46.408 --> 47:47.409
Yeah.

47:55.167 --> 47:56.418
Yeah!

47:56.418 --> 47:58.170
<i>Chris,
Richmond aren't playing with a keeper.</i>

47:58.170 --> 48:00.255
<i>They've got a brick wall
in front of the goal.</i>

48:00.255 --> 48:03.175
<i>No, Arlo, that's a person.
I can see his arms and legs.</i>

48:03.175 --> 48:04.718
<i>And his hideous mask.</i>

48:04.718 --> 48:08.305
<i>It seems like it's only
a matter of time before City equalize.</i>

48:08.305 --> 48:11.517
<i>That's all they need
to clinch the league title today.</i>

48:11.517 --> 48:13.519
Hey, Coach,
I don't want Jamie to play hurt.

48:14.019 --> 48:15.437
But we gotta make a decision here.

48:15.437 --> 48:16.897
Personally,
I'm fine with him playing hurt.

48:16.897 --> 48:18.106
I played hurt all the time.

48:18.106 --> 48:19.566
You can't walk up stairs.

48:19.566 --> 48:22.027
Okay. Let me go check, all right?

48:23.529 --> 48:25.531
Thanks, y'all. Thank you.

48:28.283 --> 48:29.785
What you looking for up there, Jamie?

48:30.369 --> 48:33.539
Looking for my dad. I can't find him.
It's freaking me the fuck out.

48:33.539 --> 48:34.665
Yeah, I get that.

48:34.665 --> 48:37.125
It's like when you don't know
where Freddy Krueger is.

48:37.125 --> 48:39.044
'Cause you know it's the second
he's gonna pop up

48:39.044 --> 48:40.712
and stick that knife-hand of his
in your face.

48:40.712 --> 48:42.631
Yeah, Freddy Krueger's fucking terrifying.

48:42.631 --> 48:44.383
Yeah, well, he had a rough childhood.

48:44.383 --> 48:46.051
And as we all know,
hurt people hurt people.

48:46.051 --> 48:48.095
Sometimes they just do it
with their knife-hands.

48:48.595 --> 48:49.888
When's the last time you saw your dad?

48:51.056 --> 48:52.140
Wembley.

48:54.142 --> 48:55.143
Y'all talk since then?

48:56.061 --> 48:56.895
Nope.

48:58.438 --> 49:00.399
Okay. If you could talk to him now,
what would you say?

49:00.399 --> 49:02.192
I'd say, "Fuck you."

49:02.192 --> 49:03.527
Yeah. Makes sense.

49:04.152 --> 49:05.988
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

49:06.572 --> 49:08.991
Yeah, I'd say, "Thank you."

49:13.579 --> 49:16.331
You know, Jamie, if hating your Pops
ain't motivating you like it used to,

49:16.331 --> 49:18.000
it might be time
to try something different.

49:20.002 --> 49:21.170
Just forgive him.

49:22.462 --> 49:23.839
Fuck no. I ain't giving him that.

49:23.839 --> 49:25.549
No. You ain't giving him anything.

49:26.049 --> 49:29.595
When you choose to do that,
you're giving that to yourself.

49:37.227 --> 49:38.854
- Come on.
- Okay.

49:40.355 --> 49:41.356
How do you feel?

49:42.608 --> 49:45.986
- Yeah. Yeah, I feel good, Coach. Yeah.
- Yeah. See, the talk helped, right?

49:47.112 --> 49:49.281
Mostly the painkillers and the adrenaline,
I think. But--

49:49.781 --> 49:51.783
But yeah, the talk helped, yeah.

49:51.783 --> 49:54.620
Good. Now get your buns out there.
Let's go.

49:54.620 --> 49:56.038
Okay, okay.

50:05.380 --> 50:06.381
Come on.

50:10.594 --> 50:12.930
Here we fucking go. Come on, Jamie!

50:14.306 --> 50:17.392
<i>Jamie Tartt
with a dramatic return to play.</i>

50:17.392 --> 50:20.896
<i>And he makes sure
he lets the City fans know all about it.</i>

50:22.606 --> 50:25.817
That's it, baby! You fucking show 'em!

50:29.988 --> 50:31.031
Hey, come on, come on, come on.

50:31.031 --> 50:33.408
<i>Jamie Tartt, do, do, do, do, do, do</i>

50:33.408 --> 50:35.244
<i>Jamie Tartt
Do, do, do, do, do, do</i>

50:36.662 --> 50:41.041
<i>Richmond have their backs
against the wall. It's De Villardi again.</i>

50:41.041 --> 50:43.168
<i>But Van Damme collects comfortably.</i>

50:43.168 --> 50:48.590
<i>And the Canadian, wasting no time,
finds McAdoo. And Richmond are off!</i>

50:49.842 --> 50:51.927
<i>Oh, that's astonishing control from Tartt!</i>

50:51.927 --> 50:53.387
Ooh! Ooh!

50:53.387 --> 50:56.139
What's happening? Thank you.

50:57.391 --> 50:58.475
<i>Tartt cuts inside.</i>

50:59.518 --> 51:00.519
<i>And again.</i>

51:01.937 --> 51:03.689
<i>Oh, he's untouchable!</i>

51:14.241 --> 51:17.202
- Go, Jamie!
- Yes! Yeah!

51:20.581 --> 51:24.126
<i>And Jamie Tartt
all but clinches the win for Richmond</i>

51:24.126 --> 51:26.920
- <i>with a spectacular solo goal!</i>
- My goodness! Did you see that?

51:26.920 --> 51:29.590
Yes, Jamie!

51:31.049 --> 51:33.343
<i>And a class move
from the native Mancunian,</i>

51:33.343 --> 51:36.471
<i>not to celebrate against his former club.</i>

51:40.601 --> 51:43.312
<i>And Richmond with a late substitution.</i>

51:48.609 --> 51:49.610
Attaboy, Jamie!

51:53.155 --> 51:54.239
Well done.

51:57.201 --> 51:59.411
Jamie Tartt, you fucking king!

52:01.121 --> 52:02.247
<i>Tartt makes way.</i>

52:02.247 --> 52:05.501
<i>And listen to this response
from the City supporters,</i>

52:05.501 --> 52:09.004
<i>an ovation for a visiting player
who was also one of their own.</i>

52:09.004 --> 52:11.798
- <i>You don't hear this every day.</i>
- Come on.

52:11.798 --> 52:14.551
<i>Just think of what it means
for Tartt to hear this.</i>

52:14.551 --> 52:17.179
- <i>And what it means for his family.</i>
- Yes. Oh, my God.

52:17.888 --> 52:19.139
Oh, my God.

52:24.645 --> 52:27.272
- Fucking beautiful.
- That was amazing.

52:36.156 --> 52:37.157
Jamie.

52:46.625 --> 52:47.668
He's a tough kid.

52:47.668 --> 52:49.336
His dad would have been proud.

52:55.592 --> 52:57.052
<i>Credit where it's due.</i>

52:57.052 --> 53:00.389
<i>Lasso rolled the dice on Tartt's fitness
and the team's talisman</i>

53:00.389 --> 53:01.932
<i>rose to the occasion.</i>

53:03.684 --> 53:06.687
<i>With time running out,
City try and cross into the box.</i>

53:06.687 --> 53:08.146
<i>But again, Van Damme is there.</i>

53:13.277 --> 53:16.405
<i>And after
that sterling performance from Richmond,</i>

53:16.405 --> 53:19.992
<i>the Premier League title will come down
to the final week of the season.</i>

53:19.992 --> 53:22.619
<i>Chris, they could win
the whole effing thing!</i>

53:22.619 --> 53:25.205
<i>Sorry for
the almost brutal language there, folks.</i>

53:25.205 --> 53:26.623
It's that time. Holy crap.

53:27.833 --> 53:30.669
- Good game. Congratulations.
- Thanks, Coach. I appreciate it.

53:30.669 --> 53:33.005
Hey, I gotta be honest with you.
You're a tough guy to beat, man.

53:33.589 --> 53:36.091
Nah, don't worry about wins or losses.

53:36.091 --> 53:39.553
Just help these guys be the best version
of themselves on and off the pitch.

53:39.553 --> 53:41.221
This, at the end,
is the most important thing.

53:41.221 --> 53:42.848
I couldn't agree more, Coach.

53:42.848 --> 53:44.349
All right, then. Take care.

53:49.146 --> 53:51.690
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

53:51.690 --> 53:54.234
- Boss. Hey, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

54:27.851 --> 54:30.395
- All right, lads. Listen up.
- All right. Yo, what's up?

54:30.395 --> 54:32.606
We've got one more game, so that means

54:32.606 --> 54:35.317
a glass of water with every single
alcoholic beverage tonight, all right?

54:36.777 --> 54:38.946
- We rolling?
- No, no. I've gotta get this sorted out.

54:38.946 --> 54:40.405
But you have fun with your water, yeah?

54:44.368 --> 54:46.036
- There's my lad. Do you proud.
- Nice.

54:46.036 --> 54:48.121
- Yeah, you bet, bruv. All right, love.
- Hey, take care, bruv.

54:48.121 --> 54:49.373
- Love.
- That's what I like, man.

54:49.373 --> 54:50.999
- Be good. Be good.
- Rest up, man.

54:50.999 --> 54:52.835
Hey, listen, man.
I wanna say I'm proud of you.

54:52.835 --> 54:55.420
- You played so well today, man.
- Appreciate it, man.

54:55.420 --> 54:57.756
- You scored a goal. Come on. Hey.
- Thanks, Jamie.

54:57.756 --> 54:59.550
Get better soon, <i>hermano</i>.
Well done tonight.

54:59.550 --> 55:01.301
Thank you, man. Big love, amigo.

55:09.351 --> 55:11.270
All right, buddy.

55:11.770 --> 55:13.522
I will see you at karaoke.

55:13.522 --> 55:16.692
I will of course sign us up
for "Islands in the Stream."

55:16.692 --> 55:18.360
But I'm calling dibs on Dolly.

55:18.360 --> 55:19.862
No can do, Coach.

55:21.280 --> 55:23.615
Mom's cooking dinner tonight.
Last night in town.

55:23.615 --> 55:25.909
All right. Well, give Dottie my love.

55:25.909 --> 55:30.664
Will do. Actually, hold on a sec, Coach.
Come here. Check this out.

55:36.336 --> 55:38.755
No, no. I know you've already seen it.

55:38.755 --> 55:41.341
I just don't know if you've watched
the whole thing. Look. Look, look.

55:42.926 --> 55:43.927
All right.

55:44.845 --> 55:46.513
So look. After we came in,

55:47.097 --> 55:50.267
Nate had to hide under my desk here
for, like, three whole hours

55:50.267 --> 55:53.687
while we were all whooping and hollering
and celebrating all around him.

55:55.355 --> 55:58.442
Then, once we all split,
he thought he was in the clear.

55:59.067 --> 56:01.111
And boom! Cleaning crew shows up.

56:01.111 --> 56:05.532
Oh, man. That's another two hours
under that desk. Yep.

56:08.035 --> 56:10.871
Well, then after they leave,
he crawls out.

56:11.496 --> 56:14.666
His legs just gotta be jelly.
He can barely stand up.

56:14.666 --> 56:17.794
Look at this. He goes to check the doors,
but they're all locked!

56:19.880 --> 56:21.632
Oh, man, that son of a gun

56:21.632 --> 56:24.551
had to climb out the window here
just to get out of the building.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.140
You know, I don't know about you, Coach.

56:30.140 --> 56:35.604
But I hope that either all of us
or none of us are judged

56:35.604 --> 56:37.898
by the actions of our weakest moments,

56:39.274 --> 56:41.944
but rather by the strength we show

56:41.944 --> 56:46.573
when and if we're ever given
a second chance.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.703
All right, have fun tonight, Coach.

56:54.206 --> 56:58.210
<i>And we rely on each other, ah ha</i>

57:02.840 --> 57:05.008
Fuck.

57:23.652 --> 57:26.446
- Hi.
- Hey. What are you guys doing?

57:26.446 --> 57:28.407
We thought we'd come and keep you company.

57:28.407 --> 57:30.367
- Fucking celebrate.
- Yeah!

57:31.076 --> 57:33.579
'Cause that was fucking amazing, Jamie.

57:34.246 --> 57:35.747
Yeah, I was fucking amazing. You're right.

57:36.748 --> 57:37.583
Yes.

57:40.711 --> 57:43.130
- You start us off.
- Don't mind if I do.

57:43.130 --> 57:46.341
Right. What the fuck happened, man?

57:48.010 --> 57:49.261
Did I look sexy?

57:52.890 --> 57:55.225
Shame you weren't injured
in your fucking head, innit?

57:59.479 --> 58:00.480
I'm back.

58:02.357 --> 58:03.358
Hey, babe. You all right?

58:03.358 --> 58:05.527
Someone never came for their pickup order.

58:06.195 --> 58:08.113
Thank you. Great.

58:10.449 --> 58:15.370
So, I don't know if you heard,
but Derek fired me today.

58:16.580 --> 58:18.415
That bastard!

58:18.415 --> 58:21.210
Yeah. I was devastated.

58:23.754 --> 58:26.924
But it made me realize that even though
there's only one match left,

58:26.924 --> 58:29.593
I have to go back to Richmond.
To make things right.

58:31.929 --> 58:33.514
Currently writing Ted an apology letter.

58:33.514 --> 58:36.683
It's 60 pages, but I'm just looking
for a few trims, so...

58:38.602 --> 58:39.728
Two secs.

58:41.146 --> 58:42.523
Sixty pages.

58:45.317 --> 58:46.151
Oh, my God.

58:59.164 --> 59:00.624
You here to kill me?

59:02.292 --> 59:04.127
Ted and I met playing college football.

59:05.504 --> 59:08.173
He was the backup punter.
I was the backup kicker.

59:08.173 --> 59:09.508
We never got in a game,

59:10.133 --> 59:13.971
but we spent a lot of time together,
jogging and doing box jumps.

59:15.347 --> 59:16.890
After school, we went our separate ways.

59:16.890 --> 59:19.434
And he was dating Michelle,
got into coaching.

59:20.310 --> 59:21.395
And I got into prison.

59:22.938 --> 59:24.106
When I got paroled...

59:26.108 --> 59:29.486
I had no money, family didn't want me.
I had nowhere to go.

59:30.404 --> 59:31.530
So I looked up Ted.

59:33.699 --> 59:36.034
He took me in, fed me.

59:37.202 --> 59:38.579
Let me crash on his couch.

59:40.080 --> 59:43.333
And in return, I stole his car.

59:45.544 --> 59:46.545
Now, I didn't get far.

59:48.088 --> 59:51.633
And I would've gone straight back
to prison if Ted didn't come down there

59:51.633 --> 59:54.636
and convince those cops
that he gave me the car.

59:55.679 --> 59:56.680
Just like in <i>Les Mis</i>.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.932
Our story is very similar to <i>Les Mis</i>, yes.

59:59.516 --> 01:00:01.185
- You went to prison?
- Yes.

01:00:01.185 --> 01:00:02.978
For stealing a loaf of meth.

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:06.690
And then I stole from my friend.

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:10.152
Who forgave me.

01:00:12.487 --> 01:00:15.824
And gave me a job. And a life.

01:00:19.203 --> 01:00:22.164
So to honor that, I forgive you.

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:28.337
I offer you a job.
And the life part's up to you.

01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:36.678
Thank you.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:46.605
You sure you don't wanna headbutt me?
I think it might make us feel better.

01:01:01.912 --> 01:01:04.039
Monday, 10:00 a.m.

01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:33.735
- Hello?
- Welcome home, honey.

01:01:33.735 --> 01:01:37.614
- Come take a seat, you must be starving.
- Yeah, okay.

01:01:37.614 --> 01:01:40.784
Hey, congratulations on your big win.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:44.371
I didn't know if you'd be in the mood
for meat loaf or lasagna, so I made both.

01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:53.130
- Mom, what's wrong? Why are you here?
- What do you mean?

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:55.799
I mean, if you got something
you need to say to me,

01:01:56.466 --> 01:01:58.218
I'd appreciate it
if you just went ahead and said it.

01:01:58.218 --> 01:02:02.514
Oh, stop. I just want to spend
my last night in London with my son

01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:04.433
and make sure everything's all right.

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:07.102
Yeah, okay.

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:10.063
Well, thank you for cooking dinner.
Both of 'em.

01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:11.607
Oh, you're welcome.

01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:16.987
- And fuck you for not wanting to talk.
- Excuse me?

01:02:16.987 --> 01:02:20.032
Thank you for flying all the way here
to come see me,

01:02:20.032 --> 01:02:21.909
and fuck you for not telling me
you were coming.

01:02:23.118 --> 01:02:27.623
Thank you for all the small, silly, little
things you did for me as a kid, you know?

01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:29.750
Like hiding notes in my lunch box

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:34.379
or putting googly eyes on the fruit
at the supermarket just to make me laugh.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.008
And fuck you for not working on yourself

01:02:38.008 --> 01:02:40.385
or seeking help after we lost dad.

01:02:40.886 --> 01:02:42.721
And for not talking to me about it either.

01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:47.267
Just glossing over the whole thing
and acting like everything was all right.

01:02:50.854 --> 01:02:52.648
I'm sorry.

01:02:57.319 --> 01:02:59.238
I didn't know what to do, Ted.

01:02:59.238 --> 01:03:03.367
So, I pretended I was okay.

01:03:03.367 --> 01:03:05.869
Okay. Well, thank you for the apology.

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:08.622
And fuck you for making me think
I had to pretend too.

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:13.293
All right.
I appreciate you sharing all this with me.

01:03:15.045 --> 01:03:17.673
I just wish you hadn't carried it around
for so long.

01:03:17.673 --> 01:03:18.924
Yeah, okay.

01:03:19.508 --> 01:03:23.095
And you're right, Ted,
I do have something to say to you.

01:03:26.056 --> 01:03:27.391
Your son misses you.

01:03:32.437 --> 01:03:33.814
Yeah, I know.

01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:37.776
I miss him too.

01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:48.036
It's just like I--

01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:53.584
It's like I'm scared sometimes to, like--

01:03:55.043 --> 01:03:57.004
to get close to that little boy.

01:03:57.754 --> 01:03:59.464
Oh, honey, why?

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:05.220
'Cause I know he's gonna leave.

01:04:11.059 --> 01:04:12.144
Oh, well...

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:18.025
God. No, no, no, no. You know--

01:04:18.025 --> 01:04:20.444
All right.
That is the thing about being a parent.

01:04:21.653 --> 01:04:23.572
Sometimes you lose and

01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:27.743
sometimes you win,
but most of the time you just tie.

01:04:31.538 --> 01:04:34.499
All we can do is keep playing.

01:04:36.335 --> 01:04:37.336
Right.

01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:44.927
Thank you.

01:04:47.262 --> 01:04:48.263
Fuck you.

01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:54.394
Oh, my goodness.

01:04:54.895 --> 01:04:57.314
I'm sorry about that. I--

01:04:58.857 --> 01:05:00.442
You know what?
Let me make it up to you, okay?

01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:04.238
Why don't you take a seat?
And I'll serve you dinner for once, okay?

01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:08.617
- What? Okay.
- Come on now, pop a squat. Go on.

01:05:08.617 --> 01:05:09.701
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:11.495 --> 01:05:16.416
Hey. You know, this therapist
must be doing you some good.

01:05:16.416 --> 01:05:17.584
Oh, boy.

01:05:18.502 --> 01:05:20.337
I'm gonna leave her out of this.

01:05:20.337 --> 01:05:24.383
Oh, wait till she hears about this. Okay.
You know what? Let's start with the wine.

01:05:24.383 --> 01:05:25.634
Let's do, please.

01:05:30.138 --> 01:05:32.140
- Bex.
- Hi.

01:05:32.641 --> 01:05:36.562
Sorry to just show up like this.
I need some advice.

01:05:37.938 --> 01:05:40.232
- Okay.
- Can we come in?

01:05:40.816 --> 01:05:41.817
We?

01:05:47.489 --> 01:05:48.490
Of course.

01:07:00.646 --> 01:07:01.813
Morning, Will.

01:07:01.813 --> 01:07:03.190
Hey. Good morning, Ted.

01:07:12.032 --> 01:07:14.201
- Hey, Boss.
- Hello, Ted.

01:07:15.035 --> 01:07:16.537
Do you know this John Wooden?

01:07:17.037 --> 01:07:18.747
No, ma'am.
Never had the chance to meet him.

01:07:18.747 --> 01:07:20.332
Oh, pity. I like this.

01:07:21.083 --> 01:07:23.168
I mean, if you don't like that,
you don't like ice cream.

01:07:24.753 --> 01:07:25.754
What's up?

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.883
- Do you know what time it is?
- 9:30.

01:07:29.883 --> 01:07:33.554
Or half nine as you folks say over here
for some goofy-ass reason.

01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:36.348
- That's just to annoy Americans.
- Yeah.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:44.940
No, this is that time of year when I come
down here and reveal something to you.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.527
Oh, snap. That's right. Okay.

01:07:49.278 --> 01:07:50.612
Well, here we go.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:53.615
You know what?
Maybe I should guess this year.

01:07:53.615 --> 01:07:55.325
No, no, no, that's silly. Yeah.

01:07:55.325 --> 01:07:58.078
No, you just go ahead and tell me.
Go on, let 'er rip.

01:08:00.122 --> 01:08:00.956
I've got nothing.

01:08:02.374 --> 01:08:04.793
I really tried as well.
I mean, even on the walk over here,

01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:07.880
I was thinking something would pop
into my head, but nope.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.424
Absolutely nothing. Sorry, Ted.

01:08:11.425 --> 01:08:14.052
No truth bomb this year.

01:08:14.845 --> 01:08:15.846
Well, that's okay.

01:08:18.223 --> 01:08:19.224
I got one.
