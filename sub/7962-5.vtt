WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:05.020
MAC:
<i> Hey, Dee! Dee! Dee! Dee!</i>

00:05.022 --> 00:06.988
<i> Do you want to take your feet</i>
<i> off my bed, please?</i>

00:06.990 --> 00:08.490
DEE:<i> It's not your bed, okay?</i>
<i> It's my goddamn floor!</i>

00:08.492 --> 00:10.291
And how many times do
I have to ask you guys

00:10.293 --> 00:11.493
to please just
pick up your shit

00:11.495 --> 00:12.727
when you wake up
in the morning?!

00:12.729 --> 00:15.330
You're turning this place
into the Superdome.

00:15.332 --> 00:17.232
Superdome? That's, like,
six years too late.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.833
That's a super lame
reference.

00:18.835 --> 00:20.068
And it's kind of offensive.

00:20.070 --> 00:21.236
You'll be happy to know,
by the way,

00:21.238 --> 00:22.537
we are looking
for a place right now.

00:22.539 --> 00:23.972
All right? What about
this place, man?

00:23.974 --> 00:25.874
Ah, it looks
a little bit junky.

00:25.876 --> 00:27.042
It kind of reminds me of here.

00:27.044 --> 00:28.176
Yeah, this place
is a piece of shit.

00:28.178 --> 00:29.511
It's not junky, okay?

00:29.513 --> 00:31.513
You guys have
destroyed everything,

00:31.515 --> 00:33.982
and that's why it looks junkier,
like a couple of locusts.

00:33.984 --> 00:35.683
Oh, I take that as a compliment.

00:35.685 --> 00:37.385
It's not a compliment.
Well, it's biblical,

00:37.387 --> 00:38.586
so it's a compliment.
Yeah.

00:38.588 --> 00:40.388
(stammers) Why is everything
so goddamn expensive?

00:40.390 --> 00:42.223
I mean,
I wish we hadn't burned down

00:42.225 --> 00:43.925
our rent-controlled apartment.
(both laugh)

00:43.927 --> 00:44.926
Yeah, you think?

00:44.928 --> 00:47.228
Dee, I will slap you
in the teeth.

00:47.230 --> 00:48.496
You think this is easy?

00:48.498 --> 00:49.864
We-we have a list
of demands here.

00:49.866 --> 00:50.999
We need two bedrooms.

00:51.001 --> 00:52.567
We-we need two bathrooms,
minimum.

00:52.569 --> 00:54.002
You know what? Whatever.
What's your plan?

00:54.004 --> 00:55.870
Where are you guys gonna
find a place that fits

00:55.872 --> 00:57.972
all of your needs for
under 1,500 bucks a month?

01:23.567 --> 01:24.766
DENNIS:
Well, guys,

01:24.768 --> 01:25.900
this is it.

01:25.902 --> 01:28.203
Welcome to our
beautiful new home.

01:28.205 --> 01:29.704
CHARLIE: This is crazy.
You guys should've just

01:29.706 --> 01:31.473
moved into that empty apartment
in our building.

01:31.475 --> 01:33.608
The one where the family
was murdered?

01:33.610 --> 01:34.642
Brutally murdered.

01:34.644 --> 01:36.478
Pass.
This place is awesome.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.880
You guys are gonna thrive out
here, and I am not gonna have

01:38.882 --> 01:40.448
to worry about you
hogging my shower anymore.

01:40.450 --> 01:41.950
And we don't have to worry
about getting ringworm.

01:41.952 --> 01:42.951
You brought the ringworm.

01:42.953 --> 01:44.085
Yeah, and now your apartment

01:44.087 --> 01:45.620
is infested with it.
Yeah.

01:45.622 --> 01:46.955
Don't worry, you'll
be back to giving

01:46.957 --> 01:48.223
each other worms
soon enough.

01:48.225 --> 01:49.491
These are city scum.

01:49.493 --> 01:51.226
They can't hack it
out here.

01:51.228 --> 01:52.293
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:52.295 --> 01:53.995
You want to bet?
Absolutely.

01:53.997 --> 01:56.164
Okay, Frank.
So if Mac and I

01:56.166 --> 01:57.665
can live here for a month,

01:57.667 --> 01:59.801
then you have to pay
our rent for an entire year.

01:59.803 --> 02:02.070
Deal. And if you don't,

02:02.072 --> 02:05.073
you have to sleep in bed
with an old man for a year.

02:05.075 --> 02:06.407
(laughing): Gross!
What?

02:06.409 --> 02:07.775
Yeah.

02:07.777 --> 02:09.744
What the hell are you
laughing about, Charlie?

02:09.746 --> 02:11.179
You already sleep
with an old man,

02:11.181 --> 02:12.947
and for no reason other than
you seem to enjoy it.

02:12.949 --> 02:14.916
(laughing)

02:14.918 --> 02:16.317
Yeah.

02:16.319 --> 02:17.585
Okay, you know what, Frank?

02:17.587 --> 02:19.821
You got a bet.

02:22.092 --> 02:23.625
Won't last a month--
Frank is insane!

02:23.627 --> 02:26.027
This place is
paradise, man.

02:26.029 --> 02:27.362
We can really
stretch out, you know?

02:27.364 --> 02:29.030
It-it's quiet,
it's calm.

02:29.032 --> 02:31.099
It's not like the city
where everything is so

02:31.101 --> 02:32.500
stressful, you know?

02:32.502 --> 02:33.768
I'm-I'm just...
I feel at ease.

02:33.770 --> 02:36.204
When was the last time
that we had a home-cooked meal?

02:36.206 --> 02:37.272
Oh, dude...
(stammers)

02:37.274 --> 02:38.273
it's been forever.

02:38.275 --> 02:40.275
Well, my friend, dig in.

02:40.277 --> 02:41.843
Mmm.

02:41.845 --> 02:44.112
Oh, my God.

02:44.114 --> 02:46.881
Mac...

02:46.883 --> 02:48.650
this is incredible.

02:48.652 --> 02:50.385
You like it?
Oh, my God.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.620
Oh, that is such a relief
because I worked so hard on it.

02:52.622 --> 02:53.955
Yeah.

02:53.957 --> 02:56.324
I call it Mac's
famous mac and cheese.

02:56.326 --> 02:57.792
(both laughing)

02:57.794 --> 02:59.227
Okay, well,
I don't know how...

02:59.229 --> 03:01.129
I don't really know
how famous it is.

03:01.131 --> 03:03.398
I mean, I'm your roommate,
and I've never heard of it.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.900
So, what do you want
to do after dinner?

03:05.902 --> 03:08.169
Uh... well, see, the
TV's not hooked up,

03:08.171 --> 03:10.038
so can't watch TV.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.807
Um, there's not really any
bars around here, so...

03:12.809 --> 03:14.075
Right.

03:14.077 --> 03:15.176
You know what
we should do?

03:15.178 --> 03:16.578
Hmm?

03:16.580 --> 03:18.012
Let's just get a
good night's sleep.

03:18.014 --> 03:19.180
That's a good idea.
Yeah.

03:19.182 --> 03:20.315
(faint chirp nearby)
Yeah.

03:20.317 --> 03:21.649
What was that?

03:21.651 --> 03:23.384
What was what?
(chirps again)

03:23.386 --> 03:26.054
You hear that,
that chirping sound?

03:26.056 --> 03:28.256
I did not, no.

03:28.258 --> 03:30.525
Probably a smoke detector
or something like that, huh?

03:30.527 --> 03:32.193
Right, yeah.
No big deal.

03:32.195 --> 03:35.096
Hey, to a great night's sleep.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.866
(crickets trilling)

03:38.868 --> 03:41.269
(low hissing)

03:45.742 --> 03:49.244
(smoke detector chirping)

03:49.246 --> 03:51.679
(fan blades swooshing)

03:51.681 --> 03:53.548
(distant lawn mower humming)

03:53.550 --> 03:55.516
(grunts)

03:55.518 --> 03:57.252
Good morning.
Mm.

03:57.254 --> 03:58.620
Hey, man, did you
hear that...?

03:58.622 --> 03:59.921
Pool filter?

03:59.923 --> 04:01.956
Oh, my God.
It was like a jet engine.

04:01.958 --> 04:04.592
I didn't get any sleep
at all last night, you know?

04:04.594 --> 04:06.294
One noise is so much louder

04:06.296 --> 04:08.196
than all the city noises
combined, you know?

04:08.198 --> 04:09.564
You just, you fixate.
Totally.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.132
I get that, but I-I
was actually talking

04:11.134 --> 04:12.967
about that chirping sound--
did you hear that?

04:12.969 --> 04:14.535
It was, like,
happening all night.

04:14.537 --> 04:15.637
No, I didn't hear that.

04:15.639 --> 04:17.538
Oh, man, it was
driving me nuts.

04:17.540 --> 04:19.107
Yeah.
Anyway, want to roll?

04:19.109 --> 04:21.376
I, uh, got us some music.
I made this Creed mix.

04:21.378 --> 04:23.211
Oh, uh, Creed, huh?

04:23.213 --> 04:24.545
Yeah, it's a long
commute, so...

04:24.547 --> 04:25.747
Yeah, I was thinking more,

04:25.749 --> 04:27.749
like, Bryan Adams.
Okay.

04:27.751 --> 04:29.417
But it-it is Tuesday.
Yeah...

04:29.419 --> 04:31.085
Which is technically
my music day.
Right.

04:31.087 --> 04:32.954
Yeah, and that was cool and all
when it only took us,

04:32.956 --> 04:34.756
like, ten minutes to get to
work, but now we're looking

04:34.758 --> 04:36.090
at, like, an hour
or so commute.

04:36.092 --> 04:37.492
I'm thinking
maybe more my thing.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.160
But, hey, you know what?
Here's an idea.

04:39.162 --> 04:41.095
Why don't you take
a personal day?

04:41.097 --> 04:42.764
You know, I mean, we got
a lot of property here.

04:42.766 --> 04:45.166
It might be nice to have
someone here to look after it.

04:45.168 --> 04:46.834
Yeah.
You know, maybe get
that TV working.

04:46.836 --> 04:48.736
Maybe take a run at that,
uh, pool filter?

04:48.738 --> 04:50.305
Oh.
Huh?
MAN: Hey!

04:50.307 --> 04:51.506
You must be the
new neighbors.

04:51.508 --> 04:52.807
Name's Wally Schmidt.

04:52.809 --> 04:54.509
No relation to Mike.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.577
But don't tell my wife.
(chuckles)

04:59.649 --> 05:02.150
Boy, it sure is a
hot one today, huh?

05:05.121 --> 05:07.255
Okay.

05:07.257 --> 05:09.691
Nice to meet you boys.

05:12.929 --> 05:14.295
What the hell was
that all about?

05:14.297 --> 05:16.097
Just comes up
and starts talking to us?

05:16.099 --> 05:18.099
Right, some guy comes up to me,
I don't know what he's...

05:18.101 --> 05:20.001
I don't know what he's up to.
No. It's like, the whole time,

05:20.003 --> 05:21.669
I'm staring at him, I'm
thinking, does he have a knife?

05:21.671 --> 05:23.271
Are we gonna have to take
this bitch out right now?

05:23.273 --> 05:24.472
No. I don't know.
I don't know.

05:24.474 --> 05:25.940
But it's-it's the city, though.

05:25.942 --> 05:27.508
It-it's forced me to develop
these sharp edges.

05:27.510 --> 05:29.277
For protection, you know?
I got to smooth them out.

05:29.279 --> 05:31.312
We're in the suburbs.
Let's work on it a little bit.

05:31.314 --> 05:33.648
Okay, all right.
Shall we? You know,
'cause now I'm all tense.

05:33.650 --> 05:35.950
I don't want to bring
this energy into work, you know?

05:35.952 --> 05:38.686

the commute to relax.

that pool filter?

06:12.355 --> 06:14.055
Uh... I tried.

06:14.057 --> 06:16.057
But it turns out, it's
actually really complicated,

06:16.059 --> 06:18.393
and I didn't go to school
for that, you know?

06:18.395 --> 06:20.595
Mostly I just tried to get
the living room set up.

06:25.101 --> 06:27.068

06:27.070 --> 06:28.736

Maybe, uh, take another
personal day tomorrow, huh?

06:30.940 --> 06:33.241
You know, maybe I will take
another run at that pool filter.

06:33.243 --> 06:34.675

all the other things

Mac, can I speak to you
in the foyer for a second?

07:57.193 --> 07:59.460
Oh, uh...

07:59.462 --> 08:00.862
Sure.
(chuckles)

08:00.864 --> 08:02.129
Excuse us for a second.

08:02.131 --> 08:03.698
Just be a...
just be a...

08:03.700 --> 08:04.966
just be a quick
minute here.

08:04.968 --> 08:06.534
Hey. What?

08:06.536 --> 08:08.436
DENNIS: Come on, man.
You gonna invite some guy

08:08.438 --> 08:10.037
over to my house
that I don't even know.

08:10.039 --> 08:11.973
MAC: I just wanted to have, uh,
somebody over for dinner.

08:11.975 --> 08:13.975
DENNIS: So I got to have dinner
with some guy, "Hey, pool guy."

08:13.977 --> 08:15.510
MAC:
His name is Jimmy!

08:15.512 --> 08:17.144
DENNIS: Jimmy? I don't give
a (bleep) what you do.

08:17.146 --> 08:19.113
MAC: You could ask him about
all sorts of things. I mean...

08:19.115 --> 08:20.515
DENNIS: What do you want me
to ask pool guy?

08:20.517 --> 08:22.517
If he knew shit
that I was interested in,

08:22.519 --> 08:24.085
he wouldn't be
a (bleep) pool guy.

08:26.623 --> 08:28.956
I said I was sorry.

08:28.958 --> 08:32.360
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm
just, uh... (chuckles)

08:32.362 --> 08:34.362
I'm just confused,
you know, I...

08:34.364 --> 08:37.365
Here I am thinking that we
got a pool that's outside.

08:37.367 --> 08:40.134
Eh... I didn't realize
that we had an indoor pool.

08:40.136 --> 08:42.136
Can we just forget about it
and eat our dinner?

08:42.138 --> 08:43.538
It's just so funny.

08:43.540 --> 08:45.973
We got enough money
for two pools.

08:45.975 --> 08:48.376
And yet we don't have enough
money for a recipe book,

08:48.378 --> 08:51.479
'cause here we are eating
mac and cheese again.

08:51.481 --> 08:52.880
You don't know
how hard it is

08:52.882 --> 08:54.882
to be cooped up in here
all by myself, okay?

08:54.884 --> 08:56.317
(laughs)

08:56.319 --> 08:57.718
At least you get
to go to work.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.153
I<i> get</i> to go to work?
Yes.

08:59.155 --> 09:01.556
Oh, everybody, hey,
I "get" to go to work.

09:01.558 --> 09:03.324
I "get" to have a job.

09:03.326 --> 09:06.093
I "get" to have to
make money for us.

09:06.095 --> 09:08.429
Oh, my... You know
what, screw this.

09:08.431 --> 09:09.764
Wh... Oh, oh, yes.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.032
Fine, just walk away
right in the middle...

09:11.034 --> 09:12.099
Dennis!

09:17.907 --> 09:20.741
(thudding)

09:20.743 --> 09:22.343
Goddamn it.

09:22.345 --> 09:23.544
What is that?

09:23.546 --> 09:25.046
(groans)

09:25.048 --> 09:26.380
Son of a bitch.

09:26.382 --> 09:27.381
What...?

09:27.383 --> 09:28.382
Son of a bitch.

09:28.384 --> 09:29.383
The hell you doing?

09:29.385 --> 09:30.384
Oh, do you hear it, too?

09:30.386 --> 09:31.786
I heard you bashing.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.120
Yeah, yeah,
that chirping?

09:33.122 --> 09:34.789
I'm pretty sure
it's a cricket.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.791
Okay, you know what, I'm
gonna say something here,

09:36.793 --> 09:39.226
and it might not
be popular, but...

09:39.228 --> 09:40.628
I hate this place.
Yes.

09:40.630 --> 09:42.229
And I got to get
back to the city.

09:42.231 --> 09:43.464
I'm going nuts.

09:43.466 --> 09:45.199
I miss the city, too.
I miss the action.

09:45.201 --> 09:47.201
You know, I thought this
place would soften my edges,

09:47.203 --> 09:48.536
but they're
sharper than ever.

09:48.538 --> 09:50.538
Dude, I cannot
be cooped up here.

09:50.540 --> 09:52.607
You know, cooking
and cleaning and fixing.

09:52.609 --> 09:54.442
All right, all right,
calm down, calm down.

09:54.444 --> 09:56.277
I... I think I
have an idea.

09:56.279 --> 09:58.112
L-Let's... let's
invite the gang over.

09:58.114 --> 09:59.614
You know, we'll
clean up the place,

09:59.616 --> 10:01.315
we'll serve 'em
a nice dinner,

10:01.317 --> 10:03.050
we'll show 'em how-how
well we're doing,

10:03.052 --> 10:05.252
and I'll feel Frank out
about this bet, you know,

10:05.254 --> 10:08.089
which in retrospect is
completely ridiculous.

10:08.091 --> 10:09.590
How are they gonna
find an old man

10:09.592 --> 10:10.992
that's gonna go
along with it?

10:10.994 --> 10:12.293
Right. Exactly.
(chuckles)

10:12.295 --> 10:14.128
(doorbell rings)

10:14.130 --> 10:16.964
Mac and Dennis, old man.

10:16.966 --> 10:19.700
Old man, Mac and Dennis.

10:26.509 --> 10:27.742
DENNIS (sighs):
Ah...

10:27.744 --> 10:29.243
MAC: So, uh, what's
with the hats?

10:29.245 --> 10:31.012
(Frank and Charlie laugh)

10:31.014 --> 10:32.847
I... You wouldn't
get it. Uh-uh.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.249
Yeah, you kind of
had to be there, man.

10:35.251 --> 10:36.817
Hey, how about
that food, huh?

10:36.819 --> 10:39.353
Mac calls it "Mac's
famous mac and cheese."

10:39.355 --> 10:40.755
And it is famous.

10:40.757 --> 10:42.323
In my stomach.
(laughs)

10:42.325 --> 10:44.091
Is it? I mean, we're your
friends, I've never heard of it.

10:44.093 --> 10:45.926
Hey, guys.

10:45.928 --> 10:47.928
We are having so much fun
at this house.

10:47.930 --> 10:50.131
I'll tell you, I can't believe
we ever lived anywhere else.

10:50.133 --> 10:52.533
But I was just curious,
if we were to lose this bet,

10:52.535 --> 10:55.703
what would
the logistics be, like,

10:55.705 --> 10:56.771
with the old man thing?

10:56.773 --> 10:58.005
FRANK:
Oh.

10:58.007 --> 10:59.874
Well, I'll tell
you what I'll do.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.876
If you guys are cracking,
you can forfeit now,

11:01.878 --> 11:05.346
I'll buy the three of youse
a California king-size bed

11:05.348 --> 11:07.181
to sleep in.
DEE: What?

11:07.183 --> 11:09.283
No, they're not gonna forfeit--
this place is rad.

11:09.285 --> 11:11.018
You want a little
side action?

11:11.020 --> 11:12.219
No, no, no, don't muddy
this with side action.

11:12.221 --> 11:13.354
Dee, don't do it.

11:13.356 --> 11:14.355
I'll take some
side action.

11:14.357 --> 11:15.356
Don't...

11:15.358 --> 11:16.524
Tell you what.

11:16.526 --> 11:18.059
How about, if they win,

11:18.061 --> 11:20.361
I'll take that California
king bed for myself.

11:20.363 --> 11:22.196
Fine, and if they lose,

11:22.198 --> 11:24.198
the three of you got to
sleep with the old man.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.399
(laughs)

11:25.401 --> 11:26.567
DEE:
Fine.

11:26.569 --> 11:27.568
Deal.
Goddamn it.

11:27.570 --> 11:28.836
Excuse me.

11:28.838 --> 11:30.705
I have to piss.

11:31.641 --> 11:33.708
Out of my penis.

11:36.079 --> 11:37.244
Right.

11:42.218 --> 11:46.220
Okay, well, clearly Mac wants
to speak to me in secret.

11:46.222 --> 11:48.389
Uh, so excuse me.

11:49.559 --> 11:51.192
Wha...?

11:51.194 --> 11:53.260
Oh, good, you got my signal.
Yeah, got your signal.

11:53.262 --> 11:55.062
Dude, we're not gonna make it,
we're not gonna make it.

11:55.064 --> 11:56.330
Yeah, dude,
it's cool, man.

11:56.332 --> 11:57.331
W-We'll figure it out.
It's...

11:57.333 --> 11:58.733
No, no, it's not cool.

11:58.735 --> 12:00.167
There's no way
we're gonna make it.

12:00.169 --> 12:01.669
And also, dude,
what's with the hats?

12:01.671 --> 12:03.237
What is with those hats?!
Dennis, I got to know!

12:03.239 --> 12:04.605
They told me the story,
and it didn't make sense,

12:04.607 --> 12:06.173
and now we can't
get it out of them.

12:06.175 --> 12:08.008
Look, dude, I don't
want to sound racist,

12:08.010 --> 12:10.211
but can we just discuss the fact
that it's an old black man?

12:10.213 --> 12:12.213
Yeah, mmm.
It was supposed
to be an old man.

12:12.215 --> 12:14.081
Just an old man.
Now it's a black man.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.750
Dude, that's, like, a whole
other thing. That's two things.

12:15.752 --> 12:17.418
That's two things,
it's two things.

12:17.420 --> 12:18.552
All right,
you know what, let's...

12:18.554 --> 12:20.187
Maybe we just...
we-we just...

12:20.189 --> 12:21.889
we take the California king.
I mean, that's a big bed.

12:21.891 --> 12:24.058
You want to share the bed
with an old black man?

12:24.060 --> 12:25.292
No, of course not, I...

12:25.294 --> 12:26.727
All right,
that sounded racist.

12:26.729 --> 12:28.362
I don't want to share
a bed with an old man.

12:28.364 --> 12:29.630
I'm just saying
it's a big bed,

12:29.632 --> 12:30.765
and we could probably
work it out.

12:30.767 --> 12:33.200
Okay, so picture
big bed, big bed.

12:33.202 --> 12:34.602
Me on the side,
you know, you right here.

12:34.604 --> 12:35.936
Old man, right here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:35.938 --> 12:38.405
Why am I in the middle? Black
man should be in the middle.

12:38.407 --> 12:40.040
Don't call him "black man."

12:40.042 --> 12:41.742
His name's not "black man."
His name's "old man."

12:41.744 --> 12:43.210
Let's stick with "old man."
Okay.

12:43.212 --> 12:44.578
Just sounds better.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.413
All right,
so how about this?

12:46.415 --> 12:49.416
You and I on the big bed,
side-by-side, black man, he's...

12:49.418 --> 12:50.951
Now you got me doing it.
Mmm.

12:50.953 --> 12:53.320
Old man is down at the bottom,
sideways, like a dog.

12:53.322 --> 12:55.456
Are you calling
black people dogs?

12:55.458 --> 12:57.758
No, that's not what I...
That's very racist.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.727
What the hell is going...?
(gasps)

12:59.729 --> 13:01.595
Oh, my God.

13:01.597 --> 13:03.597
You guys are cracking,
aren't you?
(scoffs)

13:03.599 --> 13:06.233
Nah, it's-it's, like... fine.
Nah, it's fine.
What?!

13:06.235 --> 13:08.335
It's soul-crushing, Dee!
Oh, my God, I can't make
this house into a home.

13:08.337 --> 13:09.637
I didn't go to
school for that.

13:09.639 --> 13:11.238
He didn't go to school for it.
No.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.107
Well, why did you let me
take the side action?!

13:13.109 --> 13:14.975
I told you not to take
the side action!
You bitch! You bitch!

13:14.977 --> 13:17.077
Why didn't you yell it
so I could hear it?
I'm tired of yelling.

13:17.079 --> 13:19.313
Damn it. Now we got to figure
out where Dee goes in the bed.

13:19.315 --> 13:21.682
DENNIS: Oh, right, Dee's
got to be in the bed.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:21.684 --> 13:23.150
I'll tell you exactly
where Dee goes, okay?

13:23.152 --> 13:24.618
Dee goes right
in the goddamn middle

13:24.620 --> 13:26.654
of her brand-new
California king-size bed

13:26.656 --> 13:28.656
all by herself.

13:28.658 --> 13:30.925
How are we even having
this conversation?!

13:30.927 --> 13:32.293
All you boys
have to do...

13:32.295 --> 13:36.063
Guys, all you got to do
to win is just exist.

13:39.268 --> 13:41.202
Hey, morning, buddy.

13:41.204 --> 13:42.837
You're up early.

13:42.839 --> 13:44.605
Yeah, I'm up early,
and I'm feeling great.

13:44.607 --> 13:46.607
You know, I was thinking
about it, and Dee was right.

13:46.609 --> 13:48.609
All we have to do is exist here
for the next couple weeks,

13:48.611 --> 13:49.844
and we win this bet.

13:49.846 --> 13:51.011
So... check
this out.

13:51.013 --> 13:53.480
I made you that.

13:53.482 --> 13:55.316
"Mac's Honey Do List"?
Yep.

13:55.318 --> 13:57.718
That is a list of chores to
give you a sense of purpose,

13:57.720 --> 13:59.687
so you don't feel so
cooped up and lonely.

13:59.689 --> 14:02.022
How's a list of chores going
to make me feel less lonely?

14:02.024 --> 14:04.525
Well, check out
chore number one.

14:04.527 --> 14:06.460
"Name the dog."

14:06.462 --> 14:08.395
Well, that's so stupid.
I don't have a dog.

14:08.397 --> 14:10.497
You sure about that?

14:10.499 --> 14:12.132
Yeah, positive.
I don't have a dog.

14:12.134 --> 14:13.400
I mean, I had Poppins,
but he's gone.

14:13.402 --> 14:14.902
Are you sure?
I don't have a dog.

14:14.904 --> 14:16.637
What do you mean, am I sure?
Of course I'm sure.

14:16.639 --> 14:17.638
I wouldn't
be so sure.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.139
What are you doing?
Why...

14:19.141 --> 14:20.407
What... are you okay?
Look behind you, asshole.

14:20.409 --> 14:22.543
Oh. (gasps)

14:22.545 --> 14:24.511
You got me a dog?
Yeah.

14:24.513 --> 14:27.014
Oh, my God, he's so cute!

14:27.016 --> 14:28.515
I mean, he's no Poppins, but...

14:28.517 --> 14:30.584
Yeah, he's a lot better
than Poppins, trust me.

14:30.586 --> 14:32.152
Oh, Dennis, Dennis.

14:32.154 --> 14:33.687
I'm gonna
name him Dennis.

14:33.689 --> 14:35.189
Huh?

14:35.191 --> 14:37.258
You're Dennis.
He's Dennis Jr.

14:37.260 --> 14:38.826
Weird.

14:38.828 --> 14:40.761
Um, but sure, yeah, that's fine.

14:40.763 --> 14:42.096
Hey, so why don't
you go ahead

14:42.098 --> 14:43.364
and cross number one
off the list there?

14:43.366 --> 14:45.032
See how it feels.
Okay, yeah.

14:45.034 --> 14:47.701
Hey, what's a-a couple weeks
between two best friends, right?

14:47.703 --> 14:49.103
It's whatever we make of it.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.771
So why don't we agree right now

14:50.773 --> 14:53.274
to make these next few weeks
the best of our lives?

14:53.276 --> 14:54.541
You with me, buddy?

14:54.543 --> 14:56.043
I'm with you.

14:56.045 --> 14:58.279
I'm gonna raise this guy
like he was our own son.

14:58.281 --> 14:59.546
Okay.
(laughing)

14:59.548 --> 15:00.781
Yeah. Weird.

15:00.783 --> 15:02.883

15:02.885 --> 15:07.388

Haven't seen you
for a bit.

You've probably
been staying inside

heat wave, huh?

16:14.623 --> 16:16.824

It's hot, huh?

16:19.428 --> 16:21.495
Yeah.

16:21.497 --> 16:22.997
It is super hot.

16:22.999 --> 16:24.832
Yeah.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.101
It's getting real hot
around here.

16:27.103 --> 16:30.004
So hot, Wally.

16:34.977 --> 16:37.311
You ever been in a storm, Wally?

16:37.313 --> 16:40.647
I mean, a real storm?

16:40.649 --> 16:44.518
Not a thunderstorm,
but a storm of fists

16:44.520 --> 16:46.954
raining down on your head.

16:46.956 --> 16:49.189
Blasting you in the face.

Pummeling you

your heart's gonna stop.

16:56.465 --> 16:59.400

17:13.682 --> 17:14.915
Yeah.

17:35.071 --> 17:37.905
Uh-uh.

17:37.907 --> 17:39.406
Well, I called up there.

17:39.408 --> 17:41.475
They... they said
you weren't even there.

17:42.945 --> 17:44.511
Can we not talk about my day?

17:44.513 --> 17:45.779
Sure.

17:45.781 --> 17:47.781
Perhaps we can talk
about my day.

17:47.783 --> 17:49.683
And how was your day?

17:49.685 --> 17:51.085
Not great.

17:51.087 --> 17:53.120
You know, with the dog dying
and all, but...

17:53.122 --> 17:55.456
somehow, old Mac
pulled it together.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.758
He cooked for you,
and he cleaned for you.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.394
In fact, Dennis,
everything I do,

18:00.396 --> 18:02.162
I do for you.

18:03.632 --> 18:05.699
What are you talking about, man?

18:05.701 --> 18:08.402
I'm talking about
everything I do, I do for you!

18:08.404 --> 18:09.603
And everything you do,

18:09.605 --> 18:11.939
you do for yourself!

18:11.941 --> 18:13.640
Sleeping in your car.

18:13.642 --> 18:15.275
Eating at Applebee's.

18:15.277 --> 18:17.211
Were you spying on me?

18:17.213 --> 18:18.879
Oh, don't you turn this
around on me.

18:18.881 --> 18:20.280
All you do is think
about yourself!

18:20.282 --> 18:21.648
You didn't even notice

18:21.650 --> 18:23.383
that I switched up
the mac and cheese.

18:24.420 --> 18:25.953
Is that what this is about?

18:25.955 --> 18:29.223
The goddamn
mac and cheese?

18:29.225 --> 18:31.158
Well, yeah, I noticed!

18:31.160 --> 18:32.926
You put meat hunks in it!

18:32.928 --> 18:35.095
Wow! Hunks of meat!

18:35.097 --> 18:36.663
Mmm!
Well, of course Dennis

18:36.665 --> 18:38.799
would like Dennis.
What?

18:38.801 --> 18:40.667
It's Dennis!

18:40.669 --> 18:41.802
What are you talking about?

18:41.804 --> 18:43.437
You're eating the dog!

18:43.439 --> 18:45.572
(laughing wildly)

18:47.810 --> 18:51.078
Oh! Oh!

18:51.080 --> 18:53.514
Oh, God! What is
wrong with you?!

18:53.516 --> 18:56.150
I don't know! I guess it was
just a cry for attention!

18:56.152 --> 18:57.751
You didn't even
blink twice

18:57.753 --> 18:59.486
when I told you
that the dog was dead!

18:59.488 --> 19:01.788
I can't live with you anymore
in this goddamn place.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.090
I'm out of here.

19:03.092 --> 19:04.491
I'm gonna go stay
in a hotel.

19:04.493 --> 19:06.493
Where's my suitcase, Mac?

19:06.495 --> 19:08.529
Wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

19:08.531 --> 19:10.030
Dennis, Dennis,
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis...

19:16.672 --> 19:19.306
Tell me about Mac's
famous mac and cheese.

19:19.308 --> 19:21.141
Okay, I can explain.

19:21.143 --> 19:24.011
I called it my famous
mac and cheese as-as a joke.

19:24.013 --> 19:25.512
But then it seemed
like you like it.

19:25.514 --> 19:27.948
You like that it was
Mac's famous mac and cheese.

19:27.950 --> 19:30.284
And so I just
kept saying it.
You're pathetic.

19:30.286 --> 19:31.785
You're the one
that's sitting at Applebee's

19:31.787 --> 19:32.986
eating pot stickers
all by yourself.

19:32.988 --> 19:34.288
You're the one that's pathetic!

19:34.290 --> 19:35.455
(doorbell rings)

19:36.692 --> 19:38.158
Oh.

19:38.160 --> 19:41.995
Well, that must
be nosy Wally.

19:41.997 --> 19:45.832
Coming to see what all
the fighting's about.

19:45.834 --> 19:49.836
Well... why don't we show him
what all the fighting's about?

19:49.838 --> 19:51.972
Why don't we show
him right now?
Wait, wait, wait!

19:51.974 --> 19:53.707
Dennis, Dennis,
calm down!

19:53.709 --> 19:55.375
Don't you tell me
to calm down.

19:55.377 --> 19:56.510

19:56.512 --> 19:58.178

19:59.415 --> 20:02.149

20:02.151 --> 20:04.985

the entire goddamn time!

20:04.987 --> 20:07.187
Then why wouldn't
you say something?!

20:07.189 --> 20:09.056
Because I hate you!

20:09.058 --> 20:11.391
