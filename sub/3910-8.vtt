WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:04.067
(male announcer)
Next is a Bravo
scripted original series.

00:04.067 --> 00:07.667
Yes, I--
No, I completely understand,

00:07.667 --> 00:09.100
and I apologize profusely.

00:09.100 --> 00:12.133
It will
never happen again.

00:12.133 --> 00:14.033
What did you do now?
Let me hold those.

00:14.033 --> 00:16.433
That was the preschool
ripping me a new ing.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.600
They rip you a new one
every day.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.767
They're abusive.

00:19.767 --> 00:21.833
Hazel started
this new badminton clinic--

00:21.833 --> 00:23.467
bane of my existence--

00:23.467 --> 00:26.700
that starts right at the same
time as the twins' pickup,

00:26.700 --> 00:28.300
so I've been late
a couple times,

00:28.300 --> 00:29.533
but what
am I supposed to do?

00:29.533 --> 00:31.033
As my dad says,
you can't dance

00:31.033 --> 00:32.800
at two bar mitzvahs
with one tuches.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.433
Maybe it's time to get over
your nanny complex

00:35.433 --> 00:37.133
and hire someone.

00:37.133 --> 00:39.233
Sorry, but I am not gonna be one
of those women

00:39.233 --> 00:41.133
who doesn't work
and has a nanny.

00:41.133 --> 00:44.667
Yeah, what are they doing
all day, other than not eating?

00:44.667 --> 00:47.300
Blowouts, luncheons,

00:47.300 --> 00:49.267
and committee meetings
for their charities.

00:49.267 --> 00:52.100
I have one tomorrow for
Brooke's stupid Nacho event.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.433
Okay, if that isn't a wake-up
call to get back to work,

00:54.433 --> 00:56.200
then I don't know what is.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.700
Trust me, I am planning
on going back to work

00:57.700 --> 00:59.767
once the twins
start kindergarten,

00:59.767 --> 01:01.367
unless they don't
get in anywhere,

01:01.367 --> 01:03.400
in which case I'll be
homeschooling them.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.433
Well, I wouldn't judge you for
hiring a nanny, for the record.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.333
Do you know how expensive
a nanny is?

01:08.333 --> 01:10.233
No, and I don't have time
to find out.

01:10.233 --> 01:12.733
- I have to run back to work.
- Oh, no, you can't!

01:12.733 --> 01:14.900
I have all these ideas
for your 40th birthday--

01:14.900 --> 01:17.533
male strippers,
hung like a daikon.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.767
Yes, next time.
Mwah.

01:19.767 --> 01:22.100
[smooches]
Love you.

01:23.767 --> 01:26.467
[crunches]

01:26.467 --> 01:28.267
I didn't have lunch.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.133
* Hey, yes, you know *

01:33.133 --> 01:36.800
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:36.800 --> 01:40.233
No, I would never use
that florist again.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.533
She wore overalls when
she delivered the centerpieces.

01:43.533 --> 01:46.067
So sorry, I had
the craziest morning

01:46.067 --> 01:47.400
trying to get
the kids to school.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.267
Miles had his first accident
in over a year--

01:50.267 --> 01:55.067
total "code brown" situation
on Madison Avenue.

01:55.067 --> 01:57.233
Make an amendment to
the Nacho Gala meeting notes

01:57.233 --> 02:01.533
that Jill Weber did,
in fact, show up.

02:01.533 --> 02:04.933
So we need a great theme
for the Nacho Gala.

02:04.933 --> 02:08.933
Fat kids around the world
are counting on our creativity.

02:08.933 --> 02:10.867
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

02:10.867 --> 02:13.600
Already been done.
NAG, Nut Allergy Gala.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.167
Gay Paris.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.600
MAST, Mothers
Against Strep Throat.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.433
Game of Thrones.

02:19.433 --> 02:22.300
I am going to pretend
I didn't hear that.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.967
- '80s prom.
- Bright lights, big hair?

02:24.967 --> 02:26.900
Desperately seeking
shoulder pads?

02:26.900 --> 02:30.100
Literally having PTSD flashbacks
of my real nose.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.667
Sorry.

02:31.667 --> 02:35.100
It's brilliant,
just brilliant.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.267
It'll inspire those chunks
to get fit for prom.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.900
Plus, I never had a prom.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.600
I was too busy
training for Nagano.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.833
Motion to accept '80s prom?

02:44.833 --> 02:46.067
- Motion accepted.
- Accepted.

02:46.067 --> 02:47.900
Rad!

02:47.900 --> 02:51.267
You know that
I live for my kids,

02:51.267 --> 02:54.833
but sometimes it's hard
not to miss the old days.

02:54.833 --> 02:57.267
You remember
how sex used to be?

02:57.267 --> 02:59.600
Oh, man, I hope I'm not coming
down with what Miles had.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.933
It just sucks

03:00.933 --> 03:03.467
that you can't touch their boobs
anymore, right?

03:03.467 --> 03:06.233
Well, I think right after
they give birth, they're sore.

03:06.233 --> 03:10.967
No, I mean, like, ever.

03:10.967 --> 03:14.233
Sorry. Brooke never
lets you touch her boobs?

03:14.233 --> 03:15.500
Of course not.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.367
You can't touch their boobs
after they had a baby.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.167
- [snickers, coughs]
- What?

03:21.167 --> 03:22.633
Nothing.

03:22.633 --> 03:25.067
Does Jill let you
touch hers?

03:25.067 --> 03:27.633
That is not fair.

03:27.633 --> 03:30.167
Everyone's different.
[coughing]

03:30.167 --> 03:34.100
I am definitely getting sick.

03:34.100 --> 03:38.067
Now, who's up for lobster rolls
with no buns in Kennebunkport.

03:38.067 --> 03:40.067
Wheels up, bitches!

03:40.067 --> 03:41.700
I wish I could go,
but I can't.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.933
Relax, I have to be back
by 4:30 for physical therapy.

03:45.933 --> 03:47.567
Come on, let's haul ass
to Teterboro.

03:47.567 --> 03:49.533
I have to pick up my kids.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.467
Jill, you've got to staff up

03:51.467 --> 03:53.867
so you can lean in
to motherhood.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.200
I don't think that's
what Sheryl Sandberg meant.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.067
Trust me, I know
what I'm talking about.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.800
Sheryl and I
are Facebook friends.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.100
She likes basically
everything I post.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.600
I don't know.
I just feel too guilty
having a full-time nanny.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.800
It's just not
how I was raised.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.567
Jill, you were
30 minutes late

04:08.567 --> 04:10.767
to the most important
meeting of your life.

04:10.767 --> 04:12.233
You guys can afford it

04:12.233 --> 04:15.067
now that Andy is making
real money at Hercules.

04:15.067 --> 04:18.267
Plus, you smell like...

04:18.267 --> 04:19.467
children,

04:19.467 --> 04:21.267
even from here.

04:21.267 --> 04:23.067
[sniffing]

04:23.067 --> 04:27.067
Help me help you.
Get some help.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.267
How's tomorrow?

04:32.867 --> 04:37.667
Isn't it easier to just go
through a nanny agency?

04:37.667 --> 04:39.567
I'm better than an agency.

04:39.567 --> 04:42.567
You need to observe them
in their natural habitat.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.700
Move in
and bring them home.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.233
You just described poaching.

04:46.233 --> 04:48.867
Don't tell me you have
a problem with that too.

04:48.867 --> 04:51.933
Okay, what's his deal?
Is he a "manny"?

04:51.933 --> 04:55.533
No, that is the freaky
stay-at-home dad.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.633
He's probably
a failed novelist.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.767
Tibetans are
the "it" nannies right now,

04:59.767 --> 05:01.600
but they're
impossible to find.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.767
Jamaican nannies
are know-it-alls,

05:03.767 --> 05:06.067
but they'll love
your kids to death.

05:06.067 --> 05:09.333
Okay, you do realize those are
gross generalizations, right?

05:09.333 --> 05:12.300
That one's Mormon.
They're great.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.133
They don't drink,
and they don't go out at night.

05:15.133 --> 05:17.967
The Serbian nannies
follow the kids around

05:17.967 --> 05:19.867
like Obama's Secret Service.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.933
The kids are safe
but on edge,

05:21.933 --> 05:25.333
like Sasha and Malia--
also my Facebook friends.

05:25.333 --> 05:29.900
Hold the phone.
Mingler in the white uniform.

05:29.900 --> 05:31.500
And notice she's attentive

05:31.500 --> 05:35.767
but just far enough away
to give the child freedom.

05:35.767 --> 05:36.767
Manners.

05:36.767 --> 05:38.767
She's like a Filipino
Mary Poppins.

05:38.767 --> 05:40.533
Nanny crush!

05:40.533 --> 05:43.833
Now approach her
and tell her

05:43.833 --> 05:46.900
you wish you had
a nanny just like her.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.300
If she seems hesitant,

05:48.300 --> 05:51.333
offer to double her pay
and throw in some swag.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.633
I'd stay,
but I have PT.

05:52.633 --> 05:53.833
Again?

05:53.833 --> 05:55.700
What, did you pull
a muscle or something?

05:55.700 --> 05:58.967
Um, just
an old skiing injury.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.867
Oh, here she comes.

06:00.867 --> 06:03.133
Toodles.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.500
I thought I was
the only one

06:07.500 --> 06:09.533
who washed oranges
before cutting into them.

06:09.533 --> 06:10.967
[laughs]

06:10.967 --> 06:14.833
I even wash cantaloupe,
grapefruit, pineapple.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.900
It's kept Hugo healthy
for years.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.767
He's very lucky
to have you.

06:18.767 --> 06:22.467
So do you have
any friends

06:22.467 --> 06:25.867
who are as conscientious
as you are?

06:25.867 --> 06:28.867
How many kids?
Are they potty trained?

06:28.867 --> 06:29.967
Do you allow gluten
in the house?

06:29.967 --> 06:33.567
Three kids,
potty trained-ish,

06:33.567 --> 06:35.500
and we are very
pro-gluten.

06:35.500 --> 06:40.300
I've never done this before,
but I am very unhappy.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.700
If you will match my salary,

06:41.700 --> 06:45.867
throw in a Canada goose coat
and a Burberry umbrella,

06:45.867 --> 06:47.933
we can talk.

06:50.267 --> 06:53.533
(Hadassa)
Now tighten and relax.

06:53.533 --> 06:56.700
And tighten and relax.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.367
Work that pelvic floor.

06:59.367 --> 07:02.333
Now squeeze.
Squeeze.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.800
I am squeezing.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.200
Oi.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.667
Hadassa, your people say that
in times of disappointment.

07:09.667 --> 07:12.967
What else can I do
to tighten up down there?

07:12.967 --> 07:14.533
I was told
that you're the best,

07:14.533 --> 07:16.600
but I'm still
so loosey-goosey.

07:16.600 --> 07:20.100
I felt the same way
after my first one.

07:20.100 --> 07:23.267
But 11 kids later,
my vaginal walls

07:23.267 --> 07:25.467
are tighter than
a tennis racket.

07:25.467 --> 07:29.667
I think it's time
to bring out the big guns.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.967
This is called e-stim.

07:31.967 --> 07:35.133
It's short for
"electronic stimulation."

07:35.133 --> 07:36.467
It works wonders.

07:36.467 --> 07:38.767
So which one
of these probes

07:38.767 --> 07:42.067
most closely resembles
your husband's penis, okay?

07:42.067 --> 07:43.300
This one?

07:43.300 --> 07:44.967
Smaller.

07:44.967 --> 07:46.633
This one?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.067
Smaller.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.633
This one?

07:50.633 --> 07:52.300
Um...

07:52.300 --> 07:53.433
smaller.

07:53.433 --> 07:56.067
We are talking
about an erect penis here.

07:56.067 --> 07:59.400
[chuckles]
He makes up for it
in other ways.

08:02.833 --> 08:05.833
This one?

08:05.833 --> 08:09.667
And that brings us
back to the living room.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.700
Welcome to Casa de Weber.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.133
Thank you, Mrs. Weber.

08:13.133 --> 08:15.667
I assume I am not
allowed upstairs?

08:15.667 --> 08:19.333
First of all, call me Jill,
and there is no upstairs.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.200
And you don't have
to wear that uniform.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.200
Do you have something more
comfortable you can change into?

08:23.200 --> 08:25.100
- Of course.
- Great.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.067
If you're unhappy
about anything,

08:27.067 --> 08:28.267
you just let me know.

08:28.267 --> 08:29.467
We're a team.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.567
Jill and Rowena--
Jillwena.

08:32.567 --> 08:36.167
(Andy)
Hi. I'm sick.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.467
Oh, my God. Rowena, this is
my husband, Andy.

08:38.467 --> 08:40.833
Nice to meet you.
Oh, my head is a cinder block,

08:40.833 --> 08:42.300
I got golf balls
in my throat...

08:42.300 --> 08:44.467
- I'll get you some Tylenol.
- It's not gonna help!

08:44.467 --> 08:47.100
[coughing]
Nothing's gonna help.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.067
[whispering]
He's the biggest baby
when he's sick.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.567
True for all men,
but in my country,

08:51.567 --> 08:54.367
we treat with food,
not medicine.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.333
Come to bed.

08:56.333 --> 08:59.233
I will make you
my homemade chicken soup.

08:59.233 --> 09:02.433
My nanny Yaya used to make that.
With noodles and dill?

09:02.433 --> 09:05.067
- Mm-hmm. You got it.
- Daddy's home!

09:05.067 --> 09:07.467
Guys, guys, guys,
no, no, no.

09:07.467 --> 09:09.667
Daddy can't. He has plague.
There's plague upon us.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.500
My dumplings!

09:11.500 --> 09:14.700
We are going
to play a wonderful game

09:14.700 --> 09:17.167
called "Gather Washcloths
For Daddy."

09:17.167 --> 09:19.300
[children shouting]

09:19.300 --> 09:20.900
[chuckles]
You are magical.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.933
All right, Andy, honey,
I got to get you to bed.

09:22.933 --> 09:25.700
Oh, Jill, please.
You just relax.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.633
I am here now.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.067
Come on.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.733
[line trilling]

09:43.733 --> 09:46.133
[cell phone rings]
- Hey.

09:46.133 --> 09:48.900
I just hired a nanny.
Me.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.067
Really?

09:50.067 --> 09:52.200
Does that mean
you're going back to work?

09:52.200 --> 09:53.567
Definitely...
eventually...

09:53.567 --> 09:55.067
at some point.

09:55.067 --> 09:57.333
Anyway, I'm just test-driving
the nanny thing right now,

09:57.333 --> 10:00.800
and so far, it is crystal meth
and crack in a blender.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.467
Do you want to grab coffee?
I'm dying to plan your birthday.

10:03.467 --> 10:06.800
Yes, but I'll need a real drink
after the shift I'm having.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.067
The diner in ten?

10:08.067 --> 10:10.000
Perfect. I'm literally
walking out the door,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.200
because I can--
I have a nanny.

10:12.200 --> 10:16.067
Rowena, I see you got
more comfortable.

10:16.067 --> 10:17.333
I was just stepping out.

10:17.333 --> 10:21.000
We have a big problem
on our hands.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.167
I'm sorry.
I must quit.

10:23.167 --> 10:25.400
What?

10:25.400 --> 10:26.900
[sirens wailing]

10:32.367 --> 10:33.433
[voice mail beeps]

10:33.433 --> 10:35.833
Jill, I'm at the diner
waiting for you...

10:35.833 --> 10:39.133
getting concerned looks
about my mid-morning rosé.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.600
Call me.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.100
Hey, relax.
I'm a doctor.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.267
I just got off my shift.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.433
This is technically
my happy hour.

10:45.433 --> 10:46.633
Jillian, hey!

10:46.633 --> 10:49.167
Hi. I thought you
were meeting a friend.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.333
So did I.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.500
If it makes you feel better,

10:52.500 --> 10:54.233
I was once
aggressively recruited

10:54.233 --> 10:56.467
by an AA sponsor here.

10:56.467 --> 10:59.167
We spent the last three hours
pumping raspberry cosmos

10:59.167 --> 11:00.767
out of
a 10th grader's stomach.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.300
Can you blame us
for needing a drink?

11:02.300 --> 11:03.333
(both)
Cheers.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.200
[glasses clink]

11:05.200 --> 11:09.067
I still don't understand
why you want to quit.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.167
[exhales sharply]

11:10.167 --> 11:11.267
[both coughing]

11:11.267 --> 11:13.400
I am allergic to dust.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.433
You hire a maid,
or I must leave.

11:16.433 --> 11:17.967
No, I already have one--
Sofia.

11:17.967 --> 11:20.500
- I know she's not the best.
- She's terrible.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.400
Okay, I'll hire another
housekeeper. Done.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.967
But I will be out tomorrow.
My kids' school is closed.

11:24.967 --> 11:27.367
Well, bring them over.
My kids will love it.

11:27.367 --> 11:30.067
Fine.
I must get back to work.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.067
Oh, what is my problem?

11:46.067 --> 11:49.067
I can't believe
I'm just shopping!

11:49.067 --> 11:50.667
It feels so decadent!

11:50.667 --> 11:52.433
I just don't know
why I resisted

11:52.433 --> 11:53.800
this nanny thing
for so long.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.067
I mean, my kids are happy.
My husband's happy.

11:57.067 --> 12:00.300
I showered and
actually shaved both legs.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.467
You will never go back.

12:02.467 --> 12:03.800
I just hope Rowena likes

12:03.800 --> 12:05.367
the housekeeper
you're sending over.

12:05.367 --> 12:08.067
Jill, you can't worry
about the nanny.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.600
She works for you.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.233
If Rowena's not happy,
I'm not happy.

12:12.233 --> 12:14.300
You are such a socialist.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.833
I'm just glad
that you are enjoying

12:15.833 --> 12:18.100
the perks of motherhood.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.167
Isn't it nice
having money?

12:20.167 --> 12:21.267
Kind of.

12:21.267 --> 12:23.067
Oh, let's grab a drink
at ABC Kitchen.

12:23.067 --> 12:24.400
Yeah!

12:29.100 --> 12:30.833
Rowena, guess what.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.233
Shh.

12:32.233 --> 12:34.467
[whispering]
Sorry.

12:34.467 --> 12:37.367
My sister-in-law got us
a really great housekeeper

12:37.367 --> 12:39.200
And I got the name
of an immigration lawyer

12:39.200 --> 12:40.533
for your cousin.

12:40.533 --> 12:42.833
- Why are we whispering?
- I just got the kids down.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.433
Oh, I missed them?

12:44.433 --> 12:46.500
I guess it's later
than I thought.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.167
Well, I guess
I'll go check on Andy.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.933
No, no, no, no, no.
I just got him down too.

12:49.933 --> 12:52.500
Oh, well, I'll make
the kids' lunches.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.967
Already done.

12:53.967 --> 12:56.500
Check Hazel's homework?
Start the laundry?

12:56.500 --> 12:58.267
- Set the coffee?
- It's all done.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.300
I'll take out
the recycling.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.067
Done.

13:02.067 --> 13:03.767
Okay, well I guess
I'll just slam back

13:03.767 --> 13:06.267
some valium and wine
and sleep for two days.

13:06.267 --> 13:07.833
Would you like me
to open the bottle?

13:07.833 --> 13:10.167
I was kidding.

13:10.167 --> 13:11.333
[slowed]
There's nothing

13:11.333 --> 13:15.600
for you
to do, Jill.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.233
Nothing.

13:18.233 --> 13:20.467
See you tomorrow.

13:23.233 --> 13:25.833
So now that I have
a full-time nanny

13:25.833 --> 13:28.500
and two housekeepers,
I'm wondering,

13:28.500 --> 13:31.500
what do you guys still do,
I mean, for your kids?

13:33.967 --> 13:37.233
Well, I always
give them their baths.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.633
Oh.

13:38.633 --> 13:40.067
Wait. I don't really
do that anymore.

13:40.067 --> 13:41.067
Oh.

13:41.067 --> 13:42.533
I still do
the girls' hair.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.133
You do?

13:44.133 --> 13:46.167
Oh, scratch that.
Kasey's the hair wizard.

13:46.167 --> 13:48.100
I mean, she did mine today.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.467
Oh, pretty.

13:49.467 --> 13:51.900
I read to them
before bed...

13:51.900 --> 13:54.533
unless I'm at the 7:00
Move Your Booty class.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.067
Which is every
weeknight, right?

13:56.067 --> 13:58.433
No, no, it's just Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.967
I wish they had a Friday
class, but they don't.

14:00.967 --> 14:04.633
I mean, you probably all still
eat dinner together, right?

14:04.633 --> 14:05.933
Sometimes?

14:05.933 --> 14:07.900
- Not really.
- I wait for Lex.

14:07.900 --> 14:11.333
I don't eat dinner.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.567
[door opens, closes]

14:13.567 --> 14:18.367
Hey.

14:18.367 --> 14:20.667
Hey, nuggets,
I missed you.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.633
Hi, Dakota.
Hi, Madison.

14:22.633 --> 14:25.233
Shh. Rowena's teaching us how
to make friendship bracelets.

14:25.233 --> 14:27.633
Okay, sorry.
How's everyone else doing?

14:27.633 --> 14:29.533
I have your sandwiches.

14:29.533 --> 14:31.767
Manama,
turkey no cheese.

14:31.767 --> 14:35.200
Sofia, apple brie
and honey mustard.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.700
And for my goddess, Ro,
veggie burger, no bun.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.267
I can call you Ro, right?

14:40.267 --> 14:41.933
No, Rowena, please.

14:41.933 --> 14:43.200
- Sorry.
- [coughing]

14:43.200 --> 14:46.067
Andy, what are you
doing out of bed?

14:46.067 --> 14:47.733
Manama said she had
to change the sheets.

14:47.733 --> 14:49.467
- The sheets can wait.
[dog barks]

14:49.467 --> 14:52.133
Aah! Why is there a dog
in my house?

14:52.133 --> 14:54.100
Fazile is like my child.

14:54.100 --> 14:57.400
If Rowena may bring her kids,
I will bring my Fazile.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.667
Rowena,
can I have some milk?

14:59.667 --> 15:01.933
It's Mommy.
You know what?

15:01.933 --> 15:03.967
I'm going to take you all
to the Met tomorrow.

15:03.967 --> 15:05.133
That won't work.

15:05.133 --> 15:06.700
They have a playdate
with the Yelins.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.233
Okay, well,
I'll take them Thursday.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.200
Mo Willems is reading
at the library.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.067
(Andy)
Somebody bring
me a tissue box!

15:12.067 --> 15:13.233
Coming!

15:13.233 --> 15:15.833
No, no, no.
That's what I'm here for.

15:17.767 --> 15:20.133
(Jillian)
Did you watch
the finale last night?

15:20.133 --> 15:22.100
I was bawling.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.300
What are you talking about?
I was laughing, it was so bad.

15:24.300 --> 15:25.967
- Oh, good.
- Hi.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.500
You made it.
This is Jillian.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.067
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.100
She's the one saving my life
on the graveyard shift.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.900
Oh, right, right.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.600
Sorry.
Am I intruding?

15:35.600 --> 15:36.900
No, not at all.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.267
I've been hearing
all about you.

15:38.267 --> 15:39.767
- Have a seat.
- Sit.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.467
Oh, thanks.

15:41.467 --> 15:44.500
So, is Jillian with a "G"?

15:44.500 --> 15:46.600
Nope, I'm a "J" girl.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.733
Same here.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.200
[both chuckle awkwardly]

15:49.200 --> 15:52.067
Anyway, I thought we were going
to talk birthday stuff,

15:52.067 --> 15:53.600
but we can do that
another time.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.767
It's done.
Jillian had the best idea.

15:56.767 --> 15:59.333
Tortilla Flats--
no fuss, no muss.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.700
What more do I need.
Right?

16:00.700 --> 16:03.267
I guess,
if that's what you want.

16:03.267 --> 16:06.633
Um, should I see about
renting out the whole place?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.567
Oh, Jillian knows
the manager.

16:08.567 --> 16:09.967
It's taken care of.

16:09.967 --> 16:11.833
What if I book
a mariachi band

16:11.833 --> 16:14.800
and get a piñata
and little sombreros maybe?

16:14.800 --> 16:18.233
Relax, there's nothing
for you to do.

16:18.233 --> 16:20.767
[slowed]
Nothing.

16:20.767 --> 16:23.900
[cell phone ringing]
- Oh, sorry.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.300
Hello?

16:25.300 --> 16:27.667
I always buy
their clothes.

16:27.667 --> 16:28.800
Huh?

16:28.800 --> 16:30.333
That's what I still do
for my kids.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.200
It was driving me crazy.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.867
I am very involved
in their fashion.

16:34.867 --> 16:37.733
Okay, good for you.
Sorry.

16:37.733 --> 16:39.200
[cell phone ringing]
- Oh, shoot.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.333
Sorry.
It's my nanny.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.333
- Sorry.
- Oh.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.133
Hi, Rowena.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.633
[Vanessa and Jillian
speaking indistinctly]

16:44.633 --> 16:47.467
[scoffs]
Sorry.

16:47.467 --> 16:49.967
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.233
Sorry. You would
not believe this.

16:52.233 --> 16:55.167
My new housekeeper made
my old housekeeper walk the dog,

16:55.167 --> 16:58.067
and now my nanny's
going totally shááhouse.

16:58.067 --> 16:59.333
Like, shoot me!

16:59.333 --> 17:00.767
And I have to find
a drugstore

17:00.767 --> 17:02.433
that sells
the right Swiffers.

17:02.433 --> 17:04.467
Anyway, I have to run now.

17:04.467 --> 17:06.167
But it was really nice
meeting you.

17:06.167 --> 17:07.800
Bye, honey.
I'll call you later.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.067
Bye.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.467
I have no idea
who that was.

17:12.467 --> 17:16.167
Oi.
Oi yoi yoi yoi.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.433
Hadassa, how much longer is
this therapy going to take?

17:19.433 --> 17:22.733
With his putz
and your shmundie,

17:22.733 --> 17:24.467
it's not
a good shidduch.

17:24.467 --> 17:27.800
It could take
another 6 to 12 months of work

17:27.800 --> 17:30.133
if you want to avoid surgery

17:30.133 --> 17:32.667
that anyone
with any sechel would.

17:32.667 --> 17:35.267
Okay, I didn't understand
anything that you just said,

17:35.267 --> 17:39.633
but I heard the word "surgery,"
and I want that.

17:39.633 --> 17:41.867
I don't need
this alternative sháá.

17:41.867 --> 17:44.367
But thank you so much.
Send me the bill.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.967
Shabbat shalom!

17:45.967 --> 17:48.067
It's not Shabbat!

17:48.067 --> 17:50.633
"And oil was rubbed

17:50.633 --> 17:53.567
"in the wounds of our Savior

17:53.567 --> 17:57.267
to increase His suffering."

17:57.267 --> 17:59.767
And that is the end
of chapter four

17:59.767 --> 18:02.467
of Jesus' crucifixion.

18:02.467 --> 18:05.067
One more chapter.
Come on.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.800
Rowena!

18:06.800 --> 18:09.233
(all)
Rowena! Rowena!...

18:09.233 --> 18:12.233
Hi. Can I speak with you
for a second?

18:12.233 --> 18:14.833
Yeah.

18:14.833 --> 18:17.733
I ain't walking
no fáááing dog.

18:17.733 --> 18:22.167
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

18:22.167 --> 18:25.267
Honey, I can't do this.

18:25.267 --> 18:26.900
I don't know
where I fit in.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.767
I mean, the kids
are calling me Rowena.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.133
You won't let me
check on you.

18:30.133 --> 18:32.167
You hate taking care of me
when I'm sick.

18:32.167 --> 18:35.067
That's true, and I also
hate making the kids' lunches,

18:35.067 --> 18:38.333
but this is what
I signed up for, right?

18:38.333 --> 18:39.600
I mean, I feel too guilty

18:39.600 --> 18:42.167
having other people do
what I should be doing.

18:42.167 --> 18:43.633
Well, you got to get
over that.

18:43.633 --> 18:45.400
We're paying them to work,
plain and simple.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.900
They're in our home,
taking care of our kids.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.700
It's very personal.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.800
Boris is having
an angioplasty tomorrow.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.067
Who's Boris?

18:53.067 --> 18:55.467
Manama's husband.
I'm very worried.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.867
Jill, you need
to learn to detach.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.467
My mother never used to worry
about any of this stuff.

18:59.467 --> 19:00.900
I'm sure
she doesn't even know

19:00.900 --> 19:02.133
if her housekeeper
has a husband.

19:02.133 --> 19:04.133
I'm not your mother.

19:04.133 --> 19:06.867
I'm sorry, hon.
I tried, but I can't do this.

19:06.867 --> 19:09.533
You have to fire them all.
Let me know how it goes.

19:09.533 --> 19:10.800
No, no, no, no, no.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.300
This is your decision.
You're doing it. You.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.700
Aah!

19:15.700 --> 19:18.367
Okay, I'm doing this.

19:24.067 --> 19:25.400
I'm scared.
I can't do this.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.967
I have to go
to the bathroom again.

19:26.967 --> 19:28.700
Listen to me.
Just be firm.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.633
Keep it short, detached.
You can do it.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.833
Guys,
I have some bad news.

19:38.867 --> 19:42.200
I'm afraid
this isn't working out.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.567
We're so happy
we found you,

19:43.567 --> 19:45.267
and you've all been
such a big help

19:45.267 --> 19:47.767
and a joy to be around.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.700
And you're going
to get two months' salary.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.800
What are
they trying to say?

19:51.800 --> 19:53.800
I think
we're getting bonuses.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.433
Oh, the timing
could not be better.

19:55.433 --> 19:57.533
Guys, guys,
you're not getting bonuses.

19:57.533 --> 20:00.567
It's severance.
Today will be your last day.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.133
- No, no.
- What? No, he no say that.

20:03.133 --> 20:04.667
- No.
- Sorry.

20:04.667 --> 20:07.000
I'm sorry, and I will write
you all recommendations

20:07.000 --> 20:08.900
that glow in the dark.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.467
And I hope we can
all be friends, right?

20:10.467 --> 20:11.867
Keep in touch.

20:11.867 --> 20:14.067
Help yourself to some
mini muffins on the way out.

20:14.067 --> 20:17.767
You can keep
your fáááing mini muffins.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.033
[line trilling]

20:21.033 --> 20:22.300
[cell phone ringing]
- Hey!

20:22.300 --> 20:23.467
(Jill)
Jillian seems cool.

20:23.467 --> 20:24.633
Sorry, what?

20:24.633 --> 20:28.333
Jillian seems cool.
Sorry I was so distracted.

20:28.333 --> 20:31.167
I got rid of the entire staff,
for what it's worth.

20:31.167 --> 20:32.933
I hope
I don't regret it.

20:32.933 --> 20:34.967
I'm sorry, I'm catching
every other word.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.033
Oh, just nothing.

20:37.033 --> 20:39.267
So--so, Tortilla Flats--

20:39.267 --> 20:41.267
do you want to do
something more special?

20:41.267 --> 20:42.900
Sorry.
It's really hard to hear.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.500
We'll talk tomorrow.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.100
Sure. You go do your thing.
What time do you--

20:47.100 --> 20:48.600
[cell phone beeping]
- Hello?

20:48.600 --> 20:49.700
[distant crash]

20:49.700 --> 20:50.967
What was that?

20:50.967 --> 20:53.200
(Hazel)
Sorry. I knocked
over the fish bowl.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.400
Oh, sháá.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.867
(Miles)
Mommy, I had
another accident!

20:55.867 --> 20:57.200
Again?
Seriously?

20:57.200 --> 20:58.367
All right,
I'll get the wipes.

20:58.367 --> 20:59.867
(Andy)
I think I'm going to be sick.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.767
- [retching]
- Oh, my God.

21:01.767 --> 21:03.633
(Hazel)
There's water everywhere!

21:03.633 --> 21:05.233
- [gasps]
- Rowena, you scared me.

21:05.233 --> 21:07.300
I came back
to return my key,

21:07.300 --> 21:10.067
and I thought you might
reconsider keeping me on

21:10.067 --> 21:11.467
in a way
that works for you.

21:11.467 --> 21:12.800
Thank you, but--

21:12.800 --> 21:14.233
(Andy)
Oh, God, here it comes again!

21:14.233 --> 21:15.900
(Miles)
The doodie's everywhere!

21:15.900 --> 21:17.733
All right, you take the puke.
I'll take the sháá.

21:17.733 --> 21:18.700
Done.

21:18.700 --> 21:21.767
Jillwena!
Jillwena!

21:21.767 --> 21:23.533
Jillwena!

21:23.533 --> 21:26.500
(Jill)

21:26.500 --> 21:28.500
[seagulls crying]
- Oh, dear.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.533
(woman)
Left, right, left,
right, left right!
