My name is Lena Grisky

00:01.968 --> 00:05.338
<i>and I go to the best ballet</i>

00:05.371 --> 00:06.573
I have a
secret.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.642
I'm a time traveler from
1905

00:08.675 --> 00:11.277
and my boyfriend Henri is
doing everything he can to get
me home.

(Lena) Previously...
-I'm a Russian princess from
1905.

00:49.516 --> 00:50.817
This is so
cool!

00:50.851 --> 00:52.553
Henri's plan to bring me
home didn't work.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.387
Run,
Lena!

00:54.420 --> 00:56.456
My necklace scattered
him to another year.
-Stop, Lena!

00:56.790 --> 00:59.826
(Lena) He's gone.
-Find me in Paris.

00:59.860 --> 01:04.264
Luckily the time collectors
were sent back to 1905 so I'm
safe.

01:04.297 --> 01:07.501
New plan: Blend in and
dance like my life depends
on it.

(Ines) What are you doing
up here? It's really
early.

01:25.218 --> 01:28.354
Erm... How do you say
panic?
-Freaking out.

01:28.855 --> 01:34.528
Yes, I'm freaking out. And
when I'm freaking out, I
dance.

01:34.561 --> 01:36.329
Because it calms me
out.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.799
Chills you
out.

01:38.832 --> 01:44.771
Yes, it erm... chills me
out. I'm a hundred years in
the future, Ines.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.340
You'd be freaking out
too.

01:47.373 --> 01:49.109
I've been
thinking...

01:49.142 --> 01:53.346
Mathematically, there has to
be some working formula to
describe Henri's
disappearance.

01:53.379 --> 01:55.682
The time-space
continuum is pretty
complex.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.253
Thank you. Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

02:00.286 --> 02:03.156
For not thinking I'm crazy
and for actually helping
me.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.391
You know, I really
couldn't do this without
you.

02:05.425 --> 02:08.228
Oh, God. Okay, thank you,
Lena. We can't be late.

02:08.695 --> 02:11.331
Until Henri comes for
me I'll dance.

02:11.364 --> 02:14.400
Maybe I can even learn some of
that hop-hop stuff to take
back too.

02:14.434 --> 02:15.802
I think you mean
hip-hop.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.672
Well, whatever it
is. I'm gonna rick
this.

02:18.705 --> 02:19.806
Rock
this.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.742
See, what would I
do without you?

02:21.775 --> 02:26.847
Hey! I've got an idea. Why
don't we make a video diary of
your time here?

02:28.715 --> 02:30.483
Video diary?
-Yeah.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.624
I'm still so amazed by
this.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.627
You would have to sit for
hours in my day for one
photograph.

02:40.661 --> 02:44.531
You'll get used to it.
Okay, so this is your
diary.

02:44.565 --> 02:48.401
What do you have to tell
the world about being a
time traveling ballerina?
-Hmm.

02:50.737 --> 02:53.874
Hello. I am Lena
Grisky.

02:53.907 --> 02:59.379
I'm in the future where I'll
try my best to capture my
journey to the best of my
ability.

02:59.412 --> 03:06.319
Okay, for real. This is day
one of Lena Grisky's life in
the future. Woohoo!

03:18.431 --> 03:20.300
(Henri) Okay, let's find
Lena.

03:35.315 --> 03:38.885
Are you the custodian? Great!
Cause it's like a deep freeze
in here

03:38.919 --> 03:42.523
and my muscles are cramping so
I'm gonna need you to turn the
heat on like... yesterday.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.593
I know, it can be
weird seeing me in
person.

03:46.627 --> 03:51.397
Don't worry. I get this all the
time since the show. Thank you,
Dance Off.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.400
I'm looking for...
-I'm actually not meant to
give out autographs but I
suppose I can

03:54.434 --> 03:55.836
make a little exception.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.471
Have you got a pen?
-Actually, I'm looking for
Lena.

03:59.773 --> 04:00.974
Who's
Lena?

04:01.007 --> 04:03.009
Come on, warm up's
starting.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.410
(kisses
her)

04:11.552 --> 04:12.753
First
position.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.829
Oh no. Lena hasn't arrived
yet.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.798
I'm one year behind
her.

04:36.843 --> 04:40.614
And the hair wash is kept in
the most amazing containers.

04:45.852 --> 04:50.490
No pics or vids without a
waiver. Don't make me tell
you again.

04:52.025 --> 04:57.430
I'm onto you. You think you
can come in here and be all
fainty and attention-grabby?

04:57.463 --> 04:59.900
(scoffs) You don't know
who you're messing
with.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.368
Do your
research. Check
my socials.

05:02.803 --> 05:08.474
Your what?
-Okay, that's not even funny. I
have like thousands of
followers.

05:09.075 --> 05:12.679
You do?
-Yeah, Lena, I do.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.716
And they actually follow
you?

05:16.049 --> 05:20.453
You know what? I think I have
had enough of your sarcasm
for one morning.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.456
Good luck today,
Lena. I mean that
sincerely.

05:23.489 --> 05:27.694
Thank you, Thea, that is very
kind. I wish you a good day
as well.

05:33.066 --> 05:37.771
It's called a shower.
-Well, it was terrifying. Water
fell from the ceiling.

05:37.804 --> 05:40.707
Okay, I'm sorry that I sent
you on that mission solo.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.042
(grunts) I'm
sorry.

05:42.809 --> 05:45.579
Ow!
Careful.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.447
I'm so
sorry.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.020
(students whisper, then
stop)

05:59.726 --> 06:01.361
(Max clears his
throat)

06:01.595 --> 06:02.896
That's my desk,
chica.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.766
My name is Lena, not
chicken.

06:05.799 --> 06:06.900
(all
laugh)

06:17.177 --> 06:20.113
Good morning! Algebra, page
38.

06:20.146 --> 06:24.918
Mathematics? Girls never got to
do mathematics. This is
amazing!

06:24.951 --> 06:28.655
Yeah. You might wanna
use your inside voice
today.

06:40.867 --> 06:47.908
Pride and Prejudice. Which I
trust you all enjoyed as part
of your summer reading.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.744
Let's start with some of
the main themes of the
book.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.112
Oh...
-(Madame Pelletier)
Thea!

06:53.514 --> 07:00.887
Reputation and class. Love
and courtship. And finally,
journeys.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.124
(Madame Pelletier) Very
good. And what was the
original title of the book?

07:04.157 --> 07:06.727
Oh, I know that one too.
-It was called First
Impressions.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.762
(Madame Pelletier)
Excellent!

07:08.795 --> 07:14.067
Write a 500-word essay on two
of the main themes and how they
connect to one another.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.904
(Madame Pelletier) And
next, Anna Karenina by
Tolstoy. Argh...

07:17.938 --> 07:21.041
I know him. Uncle Leo is a
family friend.

07:21.074 --> 07:25.011
No, you don't. Oh, but I do.
He was at the palace last
summer so...

07:25.045 --> 07:31.151
There. Nailed it
down. Or in... or...

07:31.184 --> 07:34.855
It! Nailed it. Yeah! It!
It!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.159
(whispering)
Lena...

07:44.531 --> 07:46.132
I was just
kidding.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.134
(Ines
laughs)

07:49.135 --> 07:50.470
(students
chuckle)

07:58.612 --> 08:02.048
Ooh, ooh, ah, yeah!
Yeah!

08:06.186 --> 08:11.792
Did that feel good? Hey! I
know you're a very big deal
and all.

08:11.825 --> 08:17.998
And I'm totally your biggest
fan for real, but you could
have let Lena answer one
question.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.934
Jeffrey, you're irritating
me.

08:21.267 --> 08:24.905
(gasps) You know my
name?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.507
(gasps)

08:26.540 --> 08:30.644
(radio announcer voice)
Ladies and gentleman, let it
be known on this very day

08:30.677 --> 08:36.149
that Thea Raphael made it
clear that she knows my name.
Whoo!

08:36.783 --> 08:40.621
Yeah! Hmm, hmm, hmm. This
is my favorite move right
here!

08:40.654 --> 08:45.592
You gotta try with me. You
just move your head like this.
Or you can walk away... Yep...

08:55.168 --> 08:58.772
(Ines) Come on, Lena. Put
on your shoes. We can't be
late. Lena!

08:58.805 --> 09:01.808
My pointe shoes?
-Erm, yes, your pointe
shoes.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.778
We have pairs in a
second. And it's with
Etienne.

09:04.811 --> 09:08.248
And you've already fainted
all over him so now is your
time to shine.

09:08.281 --> 09:13.654
But we just had ballet tech.
Isn't that enough dancing for
one day?

09:13.687 --> 09:18.158
I'm used to some ballet in
the morning and maybe a walk.

09:18.191 --> 09:24.731
Followed by some cross
stitch and maybe a
read-along with the other
girls.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.601
Lena, you have got to wrap
your head around main
unit.

09:27.634 --> 09:31.004
You're gonna flunk out
this place if you don't
pull yourself together.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.708
Everything matters. Pairs
matter, tech matters,
pliés matter.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.111
Lena, you can do
this!

09:38.144 --> 09:41.915
You're right! Thank
you! You're a true
friend.

09:41.948 --> 09:45.018
I'm wrapping my head around
main unit. Is that right?

09:45.051 --> 09:46.887
Hm-mm.
-Sounds so weird.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.992
(chuckles) Lena,
wait!

09:59.065 --> 10:01.267
None of you know how
to communicate
anymore.

10:01.802 --> 10:08.374
You're in deep meaningful
relationship with your phones
instead of each other.

10:08.408 --> 10:13.413
How can you connect as
dancers if you can't even
connect as people?

10:13.446 --> 10:19.820
In pairs, you'll use the
choreography to relay a
conversation with each other.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.723
You have until the end of
the day and I expect
excellence.

10:23.724 --> 10:28.695
You. Jeffrey, Thea,
go. You and you, go.

10:29.696 --> 10:34.134
I was for reals earlier. I
loved you in Dance Off. I even
voted for you.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.873
I also know that you've had
826,000 hits since your
epic win.

10:39.906 --> 10:43.309
So... can I apply to be
your third minion?
(Laughs)

10:43.343 --> 10:47.280
(Etienne) Mr Chase, do
you find ballet funny?

10:49.883 --> 10:53.787
(Etienne) Ines and Dash.
Lena and Max. (Snaps his
fingers)

10:55.155 --> 10:57.057
(Max
coughs)

10:57.090 --> 10:59.259
(Etienne) What are
you waiting for?
Let's go.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.362
Let's get right to work
then. Hm, sure. What...

11:03.764 --> 11:07.901
You... you gonna need to come
a little bit closer.
-Okay, yeah.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.707
Excuse me, but I'd like to
remind you to keep your
manners.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.842
Uh. From the top
then?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.244
(Max clears
throat)

11:19.613 --> 11:22.148
Do you have to be so forward?
-Are you being serious right
now?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.250
(Etienne) Stop. Is there a
problem Miss Grisky?

11:24.518 --> 11:26.386
No, sir.
-Then dance.

11:28.454 --> 11:30.256
(Max
coughs)

11:41.301 --> 11:42.769
(gasps)

11:44.037 --> 11:45.105
Keep
going.

11:49.442 --> 11:53.980
Ow! You're too stiff.
-And you're
inappropriate.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.216
It's called dancing, what
the...
-(Etienne) Enough!

11:58.184 --> 12:01.988
The best dancers in the
world have started at this
studio.

12:03.023 --> 12:07.794
Their sweat. Their dreams.
Their passion. Only the best
survive.

12:07.828 --> 12:12.098
If you're not up for
it, then leave. Now.

12:17.170 --> 12:24.144
Promenade. And
arabesque. And prepare
for the lift.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.180
Oh, that's good. Oh...
Okay.

12:27.213 --> 12:30.483
Okay?
-Yeah. Totally. Erm...

12:30.517 --> 12:34.955
Jump, spin, step,
step, and... Jazz
hands!

12:34.988 --> 12:36.422
(chuckles,
snorts)

12:38.158 --> 12:40.426
Can you be serious
for like one
second?

12:41.294 --> 12:44.831
Totally...
not!

12:47.133 --> 12:50.003
Are you having a sugar crash
or do you always act like
this?

12:50.036 --> 12:53.940
Oh girl. I always act like
this.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.279
So I was wondering if maybe
you could introduce me

12:59.312 --> 13:02.148
to one of your hot shot
producers over at Dance
Off.

13:02.182 --> 13:07.087
I figured, you know, if this
whole ballet thing doesn't
work out, I need a back up
plan.

13:10.023 --> 13:13.126
What? What? What did I
say?

13:14.394 --> 13:15.495
(sighs)

13:23.637 --> 13:26.540
You know, this assignment is
about having a conversation.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.942
Yeah, I know but
we're not talking.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.980
Hey, what does that even
mean?!

13:46.893 --> 13:49.229
(sighs) Epic fail on my
part.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.498
You think everybody
wants something from
you, and I'm sorry.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.235
That was my bad.
I didn't mean
it.

13:58.639 --> 14:00.306
What are you even doing
here?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.876
I lost a bet.
-Excuse me?

14:02.909 --> 14:05.646
Yeah well, I did a lot of
street challenges back
home,

14:05.679 --> 14:09.482
and the loser had to
audition at the ballet Grand
Prix.

14:10.651 --> 14:11.852
The
loser?

14:11.885 --> 14:14.588
Yeah, we thought it would
be humiliating to be on
stage

14:14.621 --> 14:18.058
with a bunch of
classically trained
machines like yourself and
surprise!

14:18.424 --> 14:21.862
I got in.
-You don't belong here.

14:22.495 --> 14:27.333
Wow. Nice one, Ice Queen. No
wonder you don't have any real
friends.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.070
I have friends!
-Oh yeah?

14:30.704 --> 14:32.573
Then why are you
here all by
yourself?

14:32.606 --> 14:35.642
Why are you here at all?
You're not even a real
dancer!

14:42.315 --> 14:45.451
Dear Video Diary.
I'm not going to
lie.

14:45.485 --> 14:49.523
Today has been a tough day.
Max doesn't like me very
much.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.558
I'm not sure how I'm supposed
to dance with him.

14:51.592 --> 14:54.628
But all the dancers
are so amazing
here.

14:54.661 --> 14:59.966
And I miss Henri, so much, I
really wish he...
-(Max)
Lena?

15:02.068 --> 15:06.573
We are stuck with each other
so we might as well figure out
a way to make this work.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.544
How about an actual
conversation, like
with words first?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.278
Maybe that'll loosen you
up.

15:12.312 --> 15:16.683
(gasps) I'm not
loose! You are
impossible.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.921
Lena that is not what I
meant! I don't understand,
then.

15:21.988 --> 15:26.059
We have an assignment. We
don't have a choice. Come
on...

15:27.493 --> 15:31.532
This schedule... it's
more rigorous than I'm
used to.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.168
I'm afraid I'm not good
enough.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.338
Maybe you're not.
Let's go find
out.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.575
That's a terrible thing to
say!

15:41.608 --> 15:44.077
Come on chica. Let's
go.

15:45.245 --> 15:49.616
(classical music
plays)

16:03.363 --> 16:04.998
(Jeff) Pssst!
Hey!

16:06.399 --> 16:10.604
(whispers) We're supposed to
be looking at each other. Look
at me.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.187
Next.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.352
What is
this?

17:01.087 --> 17:05.559
Uhm... It's a study about
how much can be said by
saying absolutely nothing at
all.

17:06.392 --> 17:07.628
Hmm.
Cheeky.

17:11.632 --> 17:15.401
That almost cost me my
grade. Not on my watch, OK?

17:15.435 --> 17:17.771
I don't care how cute you
are.

17:20.574 --> 17:22.075
(Max) Follow my
lead.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.771
(Max) (grunts
annoyedly)

17:51.905 --> 17:54.274
(Etienne) Seriously, is
this a joke?!

17:54.708 --> 17:57.878
You're going to practice
this until you can do it in
your sleep!

17:57.911 --> 17:59.680
Is that
clear?

17:59.713 --> 18:00.847
Yes,
sir.

18:36.950 --> 18:41.154
Oh no. No way. Not
you. Out of my shop!

18:41.187 --> 18:43.389
How many times do I have
to kick you out of here,
kid?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.425
Do you know me?
-(Oscar)
Know you?

18:45.458 --> 18:49.429
You are the
bane of my
existence!

18:49.462 --> 18:52.566
I'm not leaving until you tell
me why there's a Wanted Poster
of me on your wall.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.602
Here. In the future. I am
sure you know I'm not from
the future!

18:55.936 --> 18:58.605
This? Well, this is all your
fault.

18:58.639 --> 19:01.608
The rips in time, the
chaos, the mayhem...

19:01.908 --> 19:06.446
This is all you. Now, get out
of my shop, before anyone sees
me with you.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.614
Prove
it.

19:08.749 --> 19:10.316
You stole a
necklace.

19:10.350 --> 19:16.790
You gave it to your
girlfriend. You sent her to
the future. Sound familiar?

19:16.823 --> 19:20.594
Please, sir. I need your
help.

19:20.627 --> 19:25.398
I'm lost. I don't know where
I am, I don't know what to
do.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.333
(deep
sigh)

19:30.737 --> 19:36.209
This is when we met. Before
you ruined everything.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.379
(Henri) We look
like friends
here.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.548
Hey, what's your
name?

19:43.684 --> 19:44.885
Oscar...

19:44.918 --> 19:48.488
Why is it so cold in here?
-This is a place out of
time.

19:48.955 --> 19:54.795
Well, Oscar, if you help me
now, maybe I won't ruin
everything.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.298
I was trying to get Lena
back, and something happened.

19:58.665 --> 20:02.603
And now I'm a year behind her.
She doesn't arrive until next
year.

20:02.636 --> 20:06.239
So I really need your
help. Please.

20:07.741 --> 20:09.843
Fine.
-Really?

20:09.876 --> 20:13.413
On one
condition.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.484
Where are you
going?

20:18.952 --> 20:20.220
To
sleep.

20:20.754 --> 20:22.022
And what am I going to
do?

20:22.055 --> 20:24.925
You are going to read the
rules of time travel.

20:24.958 --> 20:28.228
Or I won't help you and
you'll be out on the
streets.

20:29.029 --> 20:30.430
Good
night!

20:37.771 --> 20:40.507
Okay, okay. Time
travel.

20:56.957 --> 20:58.592
(squeals, super
excited)

21:09.435 --> 21:12.072
It's like you've never
seen a pineapple before.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.976
We can't fail like that
ever again. Not at this
school.

21:16.610 --> 21:17.844
I
know.

21:19.713 --> 21:22.382
Truce?
-I accept.

21:27.087 --> 21:28.622
(inhales
deeply)

21:32.358 --> 21:38.064
Would you like to
finish... dining?
-No, I'm ready.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.668
Let's do
this.

21:42.903 --> 21:49.009
(Jeff) Brrr... it is cold up
in here, man. Downright I-C-Y.

21:50.811 --> 21:56.650
I feel like I'm eating a
snow cone at an ice hotel,
in like, Iceland.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.853
(blows in his
hands)

22:00.420 --> 22:01.755
What do you
want?

22:01.788 --> 22:04.658
Oooh... the ice queen
speaks!

22:06.727 --> 22:10.997
I'm sorry. Sometimes stuff
just comes flying out of my
mouth

22:11.031 --> 22:14.735
without my brain even asking
for permission. I'm an
idiot.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.473
Fine.

22:20.841 --> 22:21.908
Great.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.079
You're dismissed,
Jeffrey.

22:33.554 --> 22:35.522
It's
mango-raspberry.

22:36.489 --> 22:39.593
We just had an epic falling
out. Were you not paying
attention?

22:40.561 --> 22:43.129
Nah... we're gonna be
besties.

22:43.163 --> 22:47.768
We just needed to clear the
air, is all. Come on, I brought
you a nice treat.

22:48.434 --> 22:49.503
Thanks.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.138
Oh!
You!!

23:02.849 --> 23:05.451
(both breathe
nervously)

23:09.856 --> 23:12.458
(gasps) (sighs)
Aah.

23:15.629 --> 23:16.730
I give
up.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.167
Is that an
option?

23:23.737 --> 23:25.005
No.

23:27.708 --> 23:28.975
I'm
sorry.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.679
I'm still getting
used to everything
here.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.450
I'm sorry
too.

23:37.751 --> 23:40.053
I know I can be
pushy.

23:46.159 --> 23:47.861
(Max) I saw that
smile.

23:59.706 --> 24:04.110
Let's talk about your
fears. Exaggerate tensing
up.

24:06.146 --> 24:08.782
Come on, chica. Trust
me.

24:11.151 --> 24:13.186
Why do you keep calling me
that?

24:14.020 --> 24:17.924
It means girl in Spanish.
It's a term of
endearment.

24:17.958 --> 24:20.861
Oohh. That makes more
sense.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.568
Should we try it from the
top?

24:28.168 --> 24:29.803
Yeah. One
second.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.682
(classical music
plays)

24:57.664 --> 24:59.199
(door
opens)

25:00.667 --> 25:04.204
Once more. I don't
have all night.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.953
Not bad.
Pass.

25:55.155 --> 25:58.091
See. You can do
it.

26:03.263 --> 26:06.032
Okay. So you survived day
one.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.803
I've got so much work to
do.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.471
It's OK, you'll get used to
it.

26:11.505 --> 26:16.342
So, I've given some more
thoughts to this whole time
travel thing and it's so cool.

26:16.376 --> 26:21.782
For instance, if you take
the quantum... Hey Lena, are
you listening?

26:23.283 --> 26:27.921
Okay. Well, you've kind of
had an epic day. An epic
week, really.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.991
Get some sleep, because
it all starts again
tomorrow.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.968
(deep sigh)
