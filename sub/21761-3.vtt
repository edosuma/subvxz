Clover, what are you--

Seriously, Clover, what is going on here?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.018
-All right, that's enough!
-Ugh!

00:59.100 --> 01:01.436
I never get to have any fun.

-What is going on here?
-[Julien] Huh?

Huh?

Aah!

[screaming]

01:13.281 --> 01:14.157
Enough!

01:15.325 --> 01:17.953
Your Majesty, I'm Clover,
which makes her...

01:18.037 --> 01:19.580
[Julien gasps] Your clone!

01:19.705 --> 01:20.956
My twin sister.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.668
I knew something was off.
She was fun and playful,

01:24.752 --> 01:28.255
and not all jumpy and angry
and dead inside and--

01:28.338 --> 01:29.673
Okay! We get it!

01:29.757 --> 01:33.719
This space is great.
You have this perfect stretch of floor.

01:33.802 --> 01:38.515
Grease this bad boy up, boom!
You've got a spontaneous party!

01:38.599 --> 01:41.769
-Woot-woot!
-Woot-woot is right.

01:41.852 --> 01:45.814
Slippery floor thing is totally
blowing my mind-brain continuum.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.315
What are you doing here?

01:49.902 --> 01:51.946
I'm actually here to see my sister

01:52.029 --> 01:54.615
who is too busy
to write or visit me.

01:54.698 --> 01:58.452
How can I write or visit
when you don't have a permanent address?

01:58.535 --> 02:01.663
You're supposed to be
this insane secret agent chick.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.332
You could totally find me
if you wanted to.

02:04.416 --> 02:08.045
King Julien, can we take this offline
for a moment?

02:08.128 --> 02:11.548
I have no idea what that means,
so I will say yes.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.717
My sister has to leave immediately.

02:13.926 --> 02:17.137
Why am I getting the feeling
you two don't get along?

02:17.304 --> 02:21.433
Quick follow-up. Why don't you
have a delicious accent like your sister?

02:21.516 --> 02:24.185
-I have the same accent.
-You have an accent?

02:24.269 --> 02:27.731
Your Majesty, Crimson is bad news.
She's careless, selfish.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.734
Leaves a trail of destruction
everywhere she goes.

02:30.818 --> 02:34.446
And then, when there's no more damage
to be done, she moves on.

02:35.114 --> 02:38.993
Is this a bad time to say
I think we should break up?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.871
It's not you, it's me.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.832

Argh! You have to promise
you won't let her stay!

02:59.847 --> 03:01.140
Okay, fine. I promise.

03:53.608 --> 03:57.237
There's a hot new "it" couple,
King Julien and Crimson.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.950
Or "Cring Msulien" as those of us
in the media have started calling them.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.161
Oh! Look at 'em go!

04:07.081 --> 04:08.623
Uh! Argh!

[seagulls calling]

04:13.128 --> 04:15.255

of the   Royal Navy?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.049
Oh. It's gorgeous!

04:17.132 --> 04:19.509
And... [sniffs] ...fragrant.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.804
Yes. I wanted this night to be special.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.599
So I had them put in a fresh urinal cake.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.350
It's perfect.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.977
I am the king...

04:29.103 --> 04:34.649
of a medium-sized tribe of lemurs
on the island of Madagascar!

04:41.573 --> 04:46.036
Oh, man, this view is amazing!

04:46.120 --> 04:47.246
Why, thank you.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.957
You're not even looking
at my best side--

04:50.707 --> 04:53.085
Oh! You mean the stars! Yeah.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.336
Sometimes I look out and realize

04:55.420 --> 04:59.466
just how insignificant one lemur
is in the grand scheme of things.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.218
Then I remember I'm the king

05:01.301 --> 05:04.930
and if aliens ever invaded
they'd have to do what I tell them.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.849
I have been having loads of fun with you.

05:07.933 --> 05:11.186
Not many lemurs are as wild
and adventurous as you.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.312
Yeah.

05:12.395 --> 05:17.067
Everyone else I know has way too much
common sense to do the stuff we did today.

05:17.151 --> 05:22.030
I've finally found someone who is crazier
and more ridiculous than me.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.324
Aw! You're so sweet.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.452
And I had no idea
you were a musician.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.748
Uh, uh, uh! We prefer
the term "musical genius".

05:32.415 --> 05:34.126
[tunes playing]

05:34.334 --> 05:36.628
Of course,
I can't take all the credit.

05:36.711 --> 05:40.132
I'm really just a vessel for the sky gods
to speak through.

-Hm?

[click]

06:16.375 --> 06:17.502
Nice monocle.

06:17.585 --> 06:21.006
I'll get right to it. It's been great
catching up with you

06:21.089 --> 06:24.843
and I'm sure you had fun
endangering the king the past few days.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.637
But it's time for you to leave.

06:27.846 --> 06:31.058
Oh, Clo-Clo, we're sisters.

06:31.308 --> 06:35.187
Can't we forget about the past
and how you're always jealous of me?

06:35.270 --> 06:37.647
Oh, oh, I'm always jealous of you?

06:37.731 --> 06:41.693
I graduated at the top
of my academy class. I work for the king.

06:41.818 --> 06:46.447
And somehow I'm still
mum and dad's favorite. Super weird, huh?

06:46.531 --> 06:49.576
What? No, that is utterly ridiculous!

06:49.659 --> 06:50.827
[laughs awkwardly]

06:50.911 --> 06:52.579
Why, did they say something?

06:52.662 --> 06:53.747
Oh! Almost forgot.

06:53.830 --> 06:58.210
Good news. K.J. invited me
to hang out as long as I want.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.003
You're cool with that, right?

07:01.420 --> 07:02.381
[glass shatters]

07:05.259 --> 07:09.179
How much longer do you
plan to assault this innocent lumber?

07:09.263 --> 07:11.139
I haven't been at it that long.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.307
Ow!

07:12.391 --> 07:13.225
Splinters.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.852
Really? I understand
how you are feeling.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.355
I did not get along
with my sister.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.649
Mostly because when I was a baby,
she tried to eat me.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.403
First off, yikes!
Second, what did you do?

07:24.485 --> 07:27.030
We talked it out, settled our differences.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.823
Then I ate her.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.992
You ate her?

07:31.076 --> 07:32.327
Law of the jungle.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.746
Like, really ate her?

07:35.538 --> 07:36.456
Yum.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.751
Oh, that's-- No, stop, I--
Not a cannibal, okay?

07:39.834 --> 07:41.628
Fine. You want my advice?

07:41.711 --> 07:44.714
You said
your sister never stays in one place.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.342
Perhaps the best thing
you can do right now

07:47.426 --> 07:49.970
is to wait for her
to get bored and move on.

07:50.053 --> 07:53.514
Oh... Well, okay, yeah.
That's actually good advice.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.059
And if that doesn't work,
you can eat her.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.228
Look at me! I'm a termite!

07:58.312 --> 08:00.814
[chomping]

08:00.897 --> 08:02.482
[all] Yeah!

08:02.565 --> 08:04.943
[cheering]

08:05.026 --> 08:10.324
Welcome back to my exclusive interview
with celebrity "it" couple, Cring Msulien.

08:10.407 --> 08:15.162
So, I have to ask
because my viewers are dying to know.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.831
What does the future hold
for Cring Msulien?

08:17.914 --> 08:20.750
I don't know.
You have to ask my psychic lizard.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.170
[laughter]

08:23.253 --> 08:25.588
Guess I walked right into that one.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.881
Isn't he the best?

08:27.299 --> 08:28.633
[all] Aw.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.845
They're just rubbing
everybody's faces in it.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.597
They seem happy.
I don't get why you're upset.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.308
The last thing the king needs

08:36.391 --> 08:39.519
is someone encouraging him
to be less safe and responsible.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.022
I don't disagree. But Masikura is right.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.607
One of them will get
bored sooner or later.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.361
I say we wait and see
if this runs its course.

08:47.444 --> 08:51.948
I've never been one to make plans,
but I just know I'm crazy about this guy!

08:52.032 --> 08:54.409
[growls seductively]

08:54.951 --> 08:56.203
Yeah, baby!

08:56.370 --> 08:57.287
Aw.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.622
And this is how I feel about her.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.583
[yodeling]

09:02.667 --> 09:05.586
[growling]

09:05.670 --> 09:08.048
Help! Somebody help me!

09:08.298 --> 09:10.133
[screaming]

09:10.217 --> 09:11.843
So, does this mean

09:11.926 --> 09:16.139
we may soon be hearing
wedding bells a-ring-a-ding-a-dinging?

09:16.223 --> 09:21.436
Uh... It would be a little crazy
to just, like, jump into it so soon...

09:21.728 --> 09:24.939
is something a boring person would say!

09:25.315 --> 09:29.027
Yeah, totally!
But lemurs like us live on the edge.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.613
Are you saying
that you want to get married?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.366
Are you saying you want to?

09:34.449 --> 09:37.577
'Cause I'm an impulsive madman!
I'll do it right now!

09:37.660 --> 09:39.287
Not if I do it first.

King Julien XIII,
let's get hitched.

[gasping]

09:44.959 --> 09:46.878
You heard it here first, folks.

09:46.961 --> 09:51.508
Bring on the wall-to-wall royal wedding
coverage and commemorative plate sets.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.760
-All right! I love it!
-[cheering]

09:53.927 --> 09:56.263
I love a wedding!

09:56.596 --> 09:57.638
What was that?

09:57.722 --> 10:00.892
I know, right?
My peoples were loving it out there!

10:00.975 --> 10:03.644
Do you have any idea
what you're getting into?

10:03.728 --> 10:07.648
Yeah. What's the big deal?
Lots of idiots get married all the time.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.276
Ah!

10:09.776 --> 10:13.905
I want to thank you all
for coming to our engagement party.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.700
This wedding is gonna be pretty sick,
so it's a big honor...

10:17.784 --> 10:18.868
for you.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.038
Maurice, you're going to be my Best Lemur.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.374
That means a lot, Your Majesty.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.251
Don't get a big head about it.

10:26.334 --> 10:32.173
Xixi, since Clover's being... weird,
you're the Maid of Honor.

10:32.257 --> 10:35.676
-[excitedly] Oh!
-Masikura, you'll be getting us hitched.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.053
[bored] Woo-hoo.

10:37.596 --> 10:41.433
And last but certainly also least, Mort,

10:41.516 --> 10:43.268
you're the flower girl.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.812
I've got the perfect wig.

Hm?

21:39.966 --> 21:40.841
Yes.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.635
[gulps]
Okay, cool.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.764
-I'll go find Crimson and bring her back.
-No need.

21:46.847 --> 21:50.309
I'm a hard habit to kick, baby.
She'll be back.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.228
She'll be back.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.855
[Crimson] He stomped my heart.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.524
Humiliated me.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.236
But I'll get my revenge.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.197
I'll have the last laugh.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.242
[laughing maniacally]

22:06.826 --> 22:10.412
I came to you because
after what King Julien did to me...

22:10.955 --> 22:13.707
we share a common interest.

22:14.292 --> 22:17.044
We both want King Julien dead.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.215
Dead, exiled, whatever it takes
to get my butt back on that throne.

22:21.299 --> 22:25.011
All right, you have a deal.
Pleasure to be in business with you.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.138
[laughs maniacally]

22:27.221 --> 22:28.222
Brilliant.

22:28.306 --> 22:32.768
Crimson, with your "evil" British accent,
I won't have any trouble

22:32.852 --> 22:34.937
telling you apart from your sister.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.023
My sister has the same accent.

22:37.273 --> 22:40.276
Stop the candy maker!
Clover has an accent?

22:41.194 --> 22:43.403
