in Chicago.

The whole place was a death factory.

Turns out my dad had a partner
on his last hunt.

40:16.205 --> 40:19.082
Funny, he usually worked alone.
This guy did too...

40:19.250 --> 40:22.502
...but guess my father figured
he could trust him.

40:23.295 --> 40:26.881
Mistake. The guy screwed up,
got my dad killed.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.676
-What does this have to do--?
-It was your father.

40:30.302 --> 40:32.011
What?

40:32.179 --> 40:35.223
Why do you think John never
came back? Never told you about us?

40:35.433 --> 40:38.601
Because he couldn't look my mom
in the eye after that. That's why.

40:38.769 --> 40:42.605
-Jo--
-Just get out of here.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.733
Please, just leave.
