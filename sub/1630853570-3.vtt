WEBVTT

00:00.645 --> 00:03.083
(semi-trailer truck
driving away)

00:06.089 --> 00:08.126
(phone vibrating)

00:12.101 --> 00:13.671
MAN:
Hey, Grandma.

00:16.109 --> 00:17.746
I already went to the pharmacy.

00:17.779 --> 00:20.552
Mm-hmm. I'm on my way home.

00:20.585 --> 00:24.091
I-I got the extra strength kind.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.396
They didn't have
the back pain kind.

00:26.429 --> 00:29.335
Well, the... the extra strength
and the "for back pain"

00:29.368 --> 00:31.439
are the same stuff.

00:33.778 --> 00:36.684
No, they... they just sell it
in two different boxes.

00:41.292 --> 00:42.629
Exact same stuff, Grandma.

00:42.662 --> 00:45.067
(grunts)

00:45.100 --> 00:46.369
Uh...

00:46.402 --> 00:49.075
just literally, physically,

00:49.108 --> 00:52.214
chemically identical.

00:52.248 --> 00:53.584
Yeah.

00:54.620 --> 00:58.460
To make life interesting.
I don't know why. But...

00:58.494 --> 01:00.364
I-I got to-I got to run,
Grandma.

01:00.397 --> 01:02.234
Because there are people here,

01:02.268 --> 01:04.438
and we're turning into
a vaudeville act.

01:07.812 --> 01:11.452
Yeah. All right, see you soon.

01:15.561 --> 01:18.133
Excuse me, do you know
if the 118 came already?

01:18.166 --> 01:20.672
Oh, no, it's late.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.408
Again.

01:22.441 --> 01:23.744
Thanks.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.580
Can I-can I help you
with that?

01:43.684 --> 01:45.187
Yeah. Thank you.

01:45.220 --> 01:48.293
(phone vibrating)

01:48.326 --> 01:50.230
Hello?

01:52.201 --> 01:54.238
I've been expecting your call.

01:59.783 --> 02:02.656
Uh, well...
Yeah, hold on, please.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.628
I'll catch the next one.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.770
Thanks.

02:12.542 --> 02:15.447
(bus doors close)

02:15.480 --> 02:18.253
You do understand what it is
I do, yes?

02:22.495 --> 02:23.864
HARPER:
...went to great lengths
to make sure

02:23.898 --> 02:25.735
I'd never be on
one of them again.

02:25.768 --> 02:28.607
I was offered your number.
I took it.

02:28.641 --> 02:30.611
I don't know why I took it.

02:30.645 --> 02:34.653
I guess I figured it was okay
because there was no way

02:34.686 --> 02:36.322
I'd ever be able to use it.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.561
Why wouldn't you
be able to use it?

02:38.594 --> 02:41.533
The guy I wanted you
to visit--

02:41.567 --> 02:42.869
I figured there was
a good chance

02:42.902 --> 02:45.875
he'd never be found again.

02:45.908 --> 02:48.380
It's hard to disappear
in this world.

02:48.413 --> 02:50.183
You're giving this guy
a lot of credit.

02:50.217 --> 02:52.756
-Are you good at this?
-Beg your pardon?

02:52.789 --> 02:55.327
Are you good at this?

02:55.360 --> 02:56.730
I don't think you would've
been given my number

02:56.764 --> 02:58.501
if I weren't.

02:58.534 --> 03:01.272
I don't think so either,
but I'd like to hear you say it.

03:03.276 --> 03:06.315
Yeah.
I know what I'm doing.

03:08.286 --> 03:10.323
(indistinct chatter)

03:12.394 --> 03:14.700
What's happening?

03:14.733 --> 03:16.637
Oh, we found the guy.

03:16.670 --> 03:19.743
-You found him? Chase?
-I think so.

03:19.776 --> 03:22.649
Older couple was stopped
at a roadblock yesterday.

03:22.682 --> 03:24.519
Husband didn't have ID.

03:24.553 --> 03:26.724
Wasn't red-flagged because
he wasn't alone.

03:26.757 --> 03:29.663
Didn't fit our criteria,
but the boss man pulled it

03:29.696 --> 03:31.232
from the low-priority pile.

03:31.265 --> 03:32.869
The boss pulled it out?

03:32.902 --> 03:34.973
Well, I'm not sure
why that surprises you.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.677
They teach a class
at the academy

03:36.710 --> 03:37.746
about fugitive mindset.

03:37.779 --> 03:40.618
Half the reading is about him.

03:41.587 --> 03:42.789
Local branch tracked down
the police officers

03:42.822 --> 03:44.526
that made the stop.

03:44.559 --> 03:46.262
We sent over Chase's
Vermont driver's license photo.

03:46.295 --> 03:47.799
We're waiting on confirmation,

03:47.832 --> 03:51.205
but if it's a match, we move.

03:52.441 --> 03:53.744
Hmm.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.837
Nice of you to join us
this morning.

04:06.870 --> 04:08.974
Well, no one called me
about the early start.

04:09.008 --> 04:11.379
Is that a fact?

04:14.853 --> 04:18.393
I heard you made a move
on Agent Adams yesterday.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.767
Oh, me?
No, no, never happened.

04:24.573 --> 04:25.842
Are you calling her a liar?

04:25.875 --> 04:28.581
I don't like to use
that word.

04:28.614 --> 04:30.985
Maybe she was confused.

04:31.018 --> 04:32.956
Sometimes I just...
I get curious.

04:32.989 --> 04:35.795
Can't help asking questions,
that's all.

04:38.032 --> 04:40.638
And what'd she have to say
about your questions?

04:40.671 --> 04:43.009
Oh, she told me
to go fuck myself.

04:44.679 --> 04:46.482
Yeah.

04:46.517 --> 04:48.052
Probably should have known
I wouldn't get any answers

04:48.086 --> 04:50.090
-from her, though, huh?
-Oh, I don't know.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.798
When I was in your shoes,
sometimes I'd ask questions

04:53.831 --> 04:55.066
to get an answer.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.539
Sometimes I'd ask questions
to see

04:57.572 --> 04:59.609
what kind of reaction it got.

04:59.643 --> 05:01.814
Sometimes I'd ask questions

05:01.847 --> 05:04.719
and watch the billiard balls
bounce for a while

05:04.753 --> 05:07.826
on the off chance one of them
led somewhere interesting.

05:11.399 --> 05:13.637
That's funny.
I'm trying to figure out

05:13.671 --> 05:15.708
which one of the three
you're doing with me right now.

05:17.679 --> 05:19.883
It's fun, isn't it?

05:24.659 --> 05:25.895
You're digging around on a case

05:25.928 --> 05:29.435
that is so very hard to know.

05:30.437 --> 05:32.809
Just when you think you have it,
it'll turn on you.

05:38.787 --> 05:41.760
Be very careful with
this story, Mr. Waters.

05:41.793 --> 05:43.731
It bites.

05:52.447 --> 05:56.155
It's him.
Both officers, both confirmed.

05:56.188 --> 05:59.061
Marty, tell Captain Leslie
he's got a full green light.

05:59.094 --> 06:01.432
SWAT team's a go.
How long until they get there?

06:01.465 --> 06:03.403
MARTY:
Two hours, give or take.
Getting details now.

06:03.436 --> 06:05.908
JOE:
That's too long.
We need 'em there sooner.

06:05.942 --> 06:07.879
Someone make sure
the third floor is looped in.

06:07.912 --> 06:09.415
Let's get a clock up
on the screen.

06:09.448 --> 06:12.722
ETA of SWAT's arrival
on site, please.

06:13.724 --> 06:15.895
WATERS:
And here I was worried you
didn't want this guy caught.

06:17.431 --> 06:18.567
Congratulations, sir.

06:18.601 --> 06:20.437
I'm happy to be wrong about you.

06:20.470 --> 06:22.140
And Waters,

06:22.174 --> 06:24.178
if there's something
you want to know about me,

06:24.211 --> 06:26.717
don't harass my people.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.623
Have some balls.
Ask me yourself.

06:32.060 --> 06:34.599
You still think I'm the one
you need to worry about.

06:35.601 --> 06:37.572
Look, maybe I don't know

06:37.605 --> 06:39.809
what story we're in right now

06:39.843 --> 06:42.916
or why we're here
or how it began.

06:44.118 --> 06:46.155
But maybe I'm not the only one.

07:01.586 --> 07:03.691
(wind whistling)

07:13.510 --> 07:15.548
(slow hoofbeats)

07:35.855 --> 07:37.892
(indistinct chatter)

08:05.581 --> 08:07.618
♪ ♪

08:59.756 --> 09:01.827
CHASE:
I got the guns.

09:05.601 --> 09:08.741
Uh... uh, probably, I got 'em.

09:08.774 --> 09:11.145
Uh...

09:11.178 --> 09:12.949
might take a little while,
but I'm almost positive

09:12.982 --> 09:15.855
that they're on their...
on their way.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.226
HAMZAD:
The United States of America
has made it very clear

09:18.259 --> 09:20.731
to anyone who will listen

09:20.765 --> 09:23.537
that they have no interest
in helping me.

09:24.639 --> 09:26.877
How is it that
you're the only person

09:26.910 --> 09:28.747
who can't seem to hear them?

09:28.781 --> 09:32.120
It's possible sometimes
I only hear what I want to hear.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.164
Why are you here?

09:37.197 --> 09:40.771
I told you why I'm here.
I signed up to kill Russians.

09:40.805 --> 09:44.178
This is the only place
they let you do that.

09:44.211 --> 09:46.182
It is a big country.

09:46.215 --> 09:47.718
You can do that anywhere.

09:49.087 --> 09:50.724
Why are you here?

09:53.062 --> 09:54.264
(clears throat)

09:54.298 --> 09:56.603
(bell clanging)

09:58.239 --> 10:00.043
As long as the Agency
is backing your rivals,

10:00.076 --> 10:02.047
it's gonna be an uphill struggle
for you to keep up.

10:03.349 --> 10:05.621
All struggles are uphill.

10:05.654 --> 10:08.025
That is why
they call them struggles.

10:08.059 --> 10:10.196
Not with my help.

10:10.230 --> 10:12.802
I can get things for you

10:12.835 --> 10:14.404
that you can't get on your own.

10:14.438 --> 10:16.743
I can help you do things
that you can't do on your own.

10:16.776 --> 10:18.112
HAMZAD:
Not for long.

10:18.146 --> 10:21.786
Sooner or later,
the CIA will put a stop to that.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.158
CHASE:
They already tried.

10:26.362 --> 10:28.834
I am here against their orders.

10:28.867 --> 10:32.809
And I am procuring supplies
for you without their knowledge.

10:32.842 --> 10:34.879
Why?

10:38.452 --> 10:41.258
Been fighting the Russians
for two generations.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.166
This is the battlefield
where we finally defeat them.

10:46.703 --> 10:49.341
The one who
strikes the final blow

10:49.374 --> 10:53.049
can't just be some stooge
the CIA thinks they can control.

10:54.017 --> 10:56.055
Has to be someone worthy
of the moment.

11:00.363 --> 11:02.400
Been here longer than you know.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.342
I hear what's whispered
about you in the hills.

11:08.012 --> 11:10.116
You're the one it should be

11:10.149 --> 11:12.755
when the dust
finally settles here.

11:15.761 --> 11:17.264
Who is that?

11:19.769 --> 11:21.940
HAMZAD:
You hear whispering
in the hills.

11:23.276 --> 11:25.079
She is the one who whispers.

11:27.785 --> 11:29.354
If you want to join us here...

11:30.490 --> 11:32.728
...you will have
to persuade her, too.

11:34.499 --> 11:36.235
My wife.

11:50.463 --> 11:51.833
ZOE:
There's a moment...

11:53.837 --> 11:55.340
...when you know
they're only seeing

11:55.373 --> 11:57.244
the version of you
that they want to see.

11:59.214 --> 12:01.218
And then there's
another moment...

12:02.788 --> 12:06.028
...where they realize
that they were wrong.

12:06.061 --> 12:09.736
There's another version of you
in there somewhere.

12:09.769 --> 12:12.107
Probably always was there.

12:13.075 --> 12:15.814
And you just see it
wreak havoc on them.

12:18.954 --> 12:20.023
I mean, with my husband,

12:20.056 --> 12:21.793
it wasn't all that surprising.

12:21.826 --> 12:24.231
Before I said anything to him,
I...

12:25.199 --> 12:27.470
I suspected that...

12:27.505 --> 12:30.410
he would struggle
with a version of a wife

12:30.443 --> 12:33.082
who wasn't working...

12:33.115 --> 12:36.155
so hard
to prevent his discomfort.

12:38.092 --> 12:40.129
But with my son...

12:43.102 --> 12:44.471
That's the hard part.

12:45.574 --> 12:49.081
To feel your kid
looking at you in that way.

12:49.114 --> 12:50.818
In what way?

12:53.122 --> 12:56.462
Like someone who...

12:58.132 --> 12:59.836
...isn't worth the trouble.

13:00.604 --> 13:02.407
CHASE:
Mm.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.111
(sighs)

13:04.144 --> 13:05.480
Um...

13:05.514 --> 13:07.885
-you know...
-What time is it?

13:08.854 --> 13:11.559
-8:27.
-Oh, shit.

13:11.593 --> 13:14.464
-What?
-I got to get to the bank.
They open at 9:00,

13:14.499 --> 13:16.903
-and if I'm not there
right when it's open, it's...
-Oh.

13:16.936 --> 13:19.107
-You can't get anyone
to talk to you.
-Uh...

13:19.141 --> 13:21.579
Before you leave, there's
something I need to tell you.

13:21.613 --> 13:22.982
Yeah? What's up?

13:23.015 --> 13:24.351
(clears throat)
Uh,

13:24.384 --> 13:27.190
I got a message
from my contractor this morning.

13:28.159 --> 13:31.098
Uh, he's had some things shift,
and now he's ready to start.

13:31.131 --> 13:35.173
Turns out I need to be there
before he gets started, so...

13:36.141 --> 13:38.479
(sighs)
I think I got to go.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.527
-Oh.
-So, I'd delay,

13:45.561 --> 13:48.065
-but if I miss the window...
-No, no. No.

13:48.099 --> 13:49.468
I understand.

13:54.144 --> 13:55.480
You want to come?

13:57.150 --> 14:00.189
-What, to Montana?
-Yeah.

14:01.593 --> 14:03.229
You're not joking, are you?

14:03.262 --> 14:05.834
(chuckles softly)
I don't think so.

14:09.207 --> 14:11.245
I can't go to Montana. I...

14:12.213 --> 14:14.251
I have things to do here.

14:15.219 --> 14:17.223
Well...

14:18.192 --> 14:20.831
I had fun last night.
Did you?

14:23.670 --> 14:25.607
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I did.

14:26.609 --> 14:29.147
I don't know.
It felt, uh,

14:29.181 --> 14:32.521
more like the beginning
than the end.

14:40.169 --> 14:41.673
(chuckles softly)

14:41.706 --> 14:43.375
Here's what's gonna happen.

14:43.409 --> 14:45.446
Uh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go get some caffeine,

14:45.480 --> 14:46.983
and then I'm gonna go
to the bank

14:47.016 --> 14:49.454
and yell at a stranger
for two hours,

14:49.488 --> 14:52.093
and-and when all of that
is done,

14:52.127 --> 14:54.632
uh, we'll come back here,
we'll make some lunch

14:54.665 --> 14:56.970
and-and-and we'll...
and we'll talk about it.

14:57.003 --> 14:58.472
I'm-I'm-I'm not saying no.

14:58.507 --> 15:00.978
I mean, who knows. It-it
could be fun for a few days.

15:01.011 --> 15:02.615
I just have to deal
with this now.

15:02.648 --> 15:04.017
I can't do that.

15:04.050 --> 15:05.486
-ZOE: Can't what?
-Yeah, I...

15:05.521 --> 15:08.960
I won't be here when you
get back in a few hours.

15:08.994 --> 15:11.499
I'm sorry, but I-I can't wait.

15:11.533 --> 15:13.937
-You can't? Why can't you?
-Well, uh...

15:13.970 --> 15:15.406
Why can't you wait
until lunchtime

15:15.440 --> 15:17.477
to start a drive
that's gonna take three days?

15:17.511 --> 15:21.018
-(Zoe chuckles)
-Yeah, well, last night...

15:22.320 --> 15:24.291
...you told
that officer who stopped us

15:24.324 --> 15:25.894
that I was your husband.

15:27.397 --> 15:29.635
-(chuckles softly)
-(chuckles) Why do you think
you would've done that?

15:29.669 --> 15:31.238
I don't know.

15:31.271 --> 15:35.379
Why, uh, why did you lie
to the police?

15:37.685 --> 15:39.655
And why did you feel, you know,

15:39.689 --> 15:42.293
that you needed to protect me
from them?

15:55.486 --> 15:57.558
They were looking for you.

16:02.167 --> 16:04.471
Why were they looking for you?

16:07.143 --> 16:09.047
(sighs)

16:11.018 --> 16:13.489
-Why were they looking for you?
-(chuckles)

16:13.523 --> 16:17.430
Whatever nightmares that
you're imagining right now,

16:17.463 --> 16:19.434
please understand it's not that.

16:19.467 --> 16:22.575
This... this is
a political thing.

16:22.608 --> 16:25.581
Uh, I fought in a war

16:25.614 --> 16:28.085
that my country supported, uh,

16:28.118 --> 16:31.559
against enemies
that my country condemned.

16:31.593 --> 16:33.597
(sighs)
I did it...

16:35.199 --> 16:37.505
I did it
on the wrong side of a border,

16:37.538 --> 16:39.575
and it shouldn't have mattered.

16:41.078 --> 16:42.480
But to the people
it mattered to,

16:42.515 --> 16:45.186
it mattered a lot. Uh...

16:45.219 --> 16:48.325
This is all
ancient history, Zoe.

16:48.359 --> 16:50.564
-Am I in danger?
-No.

16:50.597 --> 16:53.302
Once we get on the road,
I'll fix all this.

16:53.335 --> 16:55.006
Am I in danger from you?

16:58.513 --> 17:00.449
No, Zoe.

17:00.483 --> 17:02.353
(chuckles softly)

17:03.355 --> 17:05.059
No, no.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.430
Shit.

17:07.463 --> 17:10.504
Look, you can come with me

17:10.537 --> 17:12.473
or you can

17:12.508 --> 17:14.244
walk out that door.

17:15.514 --> 17:17.551
It'll be like I...

17:18.787 --> 17:21.024
...you know, I was never here.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.836
Like you were never here.

17:26.869 --> 17:29.842
Well, you know, you...

17:29.875 --> 17:32.180
They might question you, but...

17:33.482 --> 17:35.654
You didn't do anything wrong.
Just tell them the truth,

17:35.687 --> 17:39.227
that, you know, I lied to you
and then I was gone.

17:39.261 --> 17:41.532
You lied to me.

17:41.566 --> 17:43.302
Yeah.

17:45.139 --> 17:47.443
-You lied to me.
-(sighs)

17:47.477 --> 17:49.214
And then I'm left
with the questions.

17:49.247 --> 17:51.385
How fucking stupid
must I have been

17:51.418 --> 17:52.788
to not have seen this?

17:52.821 --> 17:55.527
How fucking lonely?
How fucking sad?

17:55.560 --> 17:57.865
It's easy for you to say
there's no consequences.

17:57.898 --> 17:59.200
There'll be consequences.

17:59.234 --> 18:01.171
Just none of them
will affect you.

18:02.508 --> 18:04.545
(phone rings)

18:07.483 --> 18:09.154
(sighs)

18:09.187 --> 18:11.526
I got to take this.
This is my daughter.

18:12.828 --> 18:14.799
Hey.

18:14.832 --> 18:17.270
No. No, I'm still here.

18:17.303 --> 18:19.407
Yeah, I haven't left.

18:19.441 --> 18:21.512
I know.
I know time is short.

18:24.184 --> 18:25.587
Uh...

18:28.860 --> 18:31.164
Well, because I would've
had to leave alone,

18:31.198 --> 18:33.235
and I didn't want
to leave alone.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.108
As opposed to with her.

18:36.876 --> 18:39.447
Oh, you know.

18:39.481 --> 18:41.451
(chuckles)
Think about that for a second.

18:41.485 --> 18:43.523
I bet you can figure it out.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.735
Why would you want to do that?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.189
She wants to talk to you.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.592
Please don't move.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.711
Hello?

19:29.381 --> 19:30.717
EMILY:
Hi, Zoe.

19:32.387 --> 19:34.424
My name is Emily.

19:36.395 --> 19:38.399
I know how you feel right now.

19:39.401 --> 19:43.242
I know because I'm probably
the only other person on Earth

19:43.275 --> 19:44.612
who's felt it, too.

19:46.582 --> 19:48.520
On my 18th birthday,

19:48.553 --> 19:50.256
my dad sat me down

19:50.289 --> 19:52.293
and he told me

19:52.326 --> 19:54.464
that my world

19:54.498 --> 19:56.803
wasn't what I thought it was.

19:56.836 --> 20:00.777
Until then, it had been
soccer, braces.

20:00.811 --> 20:03.983
You know, summer camp.

20:04.017 --> 20:06.589
But before that,

20:06.622 --> 20:09.929
long before that,
long before I was born,

20:09.962 --> 20:11.866
it had been a war...

20:13.837 --> 20:16.676
...that ended very badly

20:16.709 --> 20:19.548
and an escape that forced
my father and my mother

20:19.582 --> 20:23.322
into hiding under assumed names.

20:26.428 --> 20:28.365
I couldn't breathe.

20:28.399 --> 20:32.240
I was so frightened of him.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.745
I imagined
all the things he'd done,

20:34.779 --> 20:36.816
the blood on his hands.

20:38.452 --> 20:41.692
But I think the most frightening
thought I had in my mind was

20:41.726 --> 20:43.997
how could I trust someone

20:44.030 --> 20:46.268
who had hidden something from me

20:46.301 --> 20:49.007
as important as a name?

20:50.309 --> 20:52.848
And then my mother
sat down beside me,

20:52.881 --> 20:55.554
and she took my hand in hers.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.923
And she said...

20:58.025 --> 21:01.599
"A name is just a name.

21:01.632 --> 21:05.306
"A sound we make
in his presence.

21:05.339 --> 21:07.678
A breath of air."

21:07.711 --> 21:10.049
What's meaningful
isn't what we call him.

21:10.082 --> 21:11.652
It's what he is.

21:13.055 --> 21:16.328
The good he did.
The suffering that he lessened.

21:16.361 --> 21:18.432
The lives he saved.

21:18.465 --> 21:20.604
So many lives.

21:20.637 --> 21:22.340
Her life.

21:23.643 --> 21:25.346
He freed her...

21:27.651 --> 21:29.989
...so that one day,
I would be free.

21:33.630 --> 21:35.967
A name is just a name.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.446
And if a new name is the price
to be paid for freedom,

21:42.480 --> 21:44.484
for meaning, for purpose,

21:44.518 --> 21:46.622
for finding a place
in the world to stand

21:46.656 --> 21:48.292
and do something good...

21:55.072 --> 21:57.644
...then it's a small price
to pay.

22:01.084 --> 22:04.558
My father protected me.

22:04.592 --> 22:07.363
He protected my mother.

22:07.396 --> 22:11.371
And I can hear it in his voice.
He wants to protect you.

22:11.404 --> 22:12.774
He will.

22:14.077 --> 22:16.983
If you want him to.
If you let him.

22:17.951 --> 22:20.824
Time is short, and I have to go,
and so does he.

22:20.857 --> 22:23.128
So, go. Stay.

22:23.161 --> 22:25.132
Either way.

22:25.165 --> 22:26.802
I just needed you to know

22:26.836 --> 22:29.007
who it was
you had crossed paths with,

22:29.040 --> 22:31.746
no matter what name
you happen to know him by.

It's a different thing now, Zoe.

27:14.845 --> 27:16.682
I don't know who we can trust.

Is the UAV live yet?

27:36.221 --> 27:37.691
Four minutes.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.661
Oh, hello. Half day today?

27:39.695 --> 27:41.197
-I had an errand to run.
-Ah.

27:41.231 --> 27:43.201
-What kind of errand?
-HARPER: Adams!

27:43.235 --> 27:44.972
That kind.

27:47.978 --> 27:50.148
Joe thinks I went to
the fucking movies this morning

27:50.182 --> 27:53.990
-or something.
-I don't think they have movies
at 7:30 in the morning.

27:54.992 --> 27:56.461
Actually, I don't really know

27:56.495 --> 27:58.699
if they have movies
at 7:30 in the morning.

27:58.733 --> 28:00.202
Last time I went to a movie,

28:00.235 --> 28:02.741
I looked up the times
in the newspaper

28:02.774 --> 28:04.711
and bought a ticket
at the little window

28:04.745 --> 28:06.782
with cash.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.391
What?

28:12.994 --> 28:14.932
Um, no, I-I was just...

28:14.965 --> 28:16.969
I just remembered
that the last time, uh,

28:17.002 --> 28:19.040
I saw a m... a movie
was with Chip.

28:24.217 --> 28:26.454
-Sorry.
-About what?

28:26.487 --> 28:29.260
No, I've just been trying
so hard not to bring it up,

28:29.293 --> 28:31.197
and then, of course,
I just walk right into it.

28:33.168 --> 28:35.974
You think
maybe not talking about it

28:36.007 --> 28:37.811
just makes it worse?

28:40.115 --> 28:43.154
Definitely doesn't make it
feel any better, does it?

28:47.898 --> 28:50.068
You haven't been to the house
since it happened.

28:51.437 --> 28:53.074
(Harper sighs)

28:53.108 --> 28:55.747
Once we dig ourselves out of

28:55.780 --> 28:57.751
whatever the hell this is...

28:58.451 --> 28:59.955
...maybe we can fix that.

29:00.924 --> 29:02.326
Yeah.

29:07.504 --> 29:09.875
Any news this morning?

29:09.908 --> 29:11.979
Yes. Sally Singleton

29:12.012 --> 29:13.549
and I had bagels at Abe's,

29:13.582 --> 29:16.487
and I asked her
about our friend over there.

29:20.462 --> 29:22.867
Told her I figured
he must be wired in

29:22.901 --> 29:24.771
to a top-tier rabbi
to get an assignment like this.

29:24.805 --> 29:27.042
-Porter or Brady.
-That's what I said.

29:27.076 --> 29:30.917
-You know,
is it possible that Myers...
-Everyone hates him.

29:30.950 --> 29:32.419
Wh-What do you mean, "everyone"?

29:32.453 --> 29:34.925
Literally everyone hates him.

29:34.958 --> 29:38.031
You know how a four-year-old
asks a simple question,

29:38.064 --> 29:39.868
and you give them an answer,

29:39.901 --> 29:41.538
and then they ask, "Why?"

29:41.572 --> 29:43.208
And then you answer it,

29:43.241 --> 29:46.214
and then it's,
"Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?"

29:46.247 --> 29:47.817
until the point
where you're explaining

29:47.851 --> 29:49.120
the nature of reality?

29:49.153 --> 29:52.126
-Yeah.
-That's him.

29:52.159 --> 29:54.498
Sally said, and I'm quoting,

29:54.531 --> 29:56.802
"He's the nosiest motherfucker

29:56.835 --> 30:00.409
in the history of the CIA."

30:00.442 --> 30:04.216
Faraz Hamzad
has all this leverage.

30:04.250 --> 30:07.824
We are following his script.

30:07.857 --> 30:10.596
And then an unqualified busybody
that nobody likes

30:10.630 --> 30:12.834
gets put in charge of this op?

30:12.867 --> 30:15.005
How does that make any sense?

30:17.009 --> 30:18.345
It doesn't.

30:20.015 --> 30:22.286
You don't seem
too concerned about this.

30:22.319 --> 30:25.526
Well, I can understand
why you'd be.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.966
That's how I taught you
to play the game. Like a cop.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.503
-Mm.
-To a cop,

30:30.536 --> 30:33.375
a puzzle
is a thing to be solved.

30:33.408 --> 30:35.212
But the other game,

30:35.245 --> 30:38.018
the one that Chase and I played
when we were young--

30:38.051 --> 30:41.925
the one I'm starting to realize
we're playing again--

30:41.959 --> 30:44.965
that game has no rules.

30:44.998 --> 30:47.136
Its puzzles have no solutions.

30:47.169 --> 30:49.574
They just lead to other puzzles.

30:50.676 --> 30:54.551
That's what makes this game
so interesting.

30:54.584 --> 30:57.189
It's not for the faint of heart.

30:58.458 --> 31:00.496
But it's a hell of a drug.

31:00.530 --> 31:02.567
MARTY:
We've got a problem here.

31:03.969 --> 31:07.911

34:06.735 --> 34:08.171
on Soviet unit strength

34:08.204 --> 34:09.741
that the Agency
doesn't even give to ISI.

34:09.774 --> 34:11.477
We know more

34:18.525 --> 34:20.195
Could you maybe use those?

34:20.228 --> 34:23.067
If you can produce those guns--
emphasis on "if"--

34:23.101 --> 34:24.771
maybe you can start
shooting Russian officers

34:24.804 --> 34:26.374

our problems that way.

34:33.388 --> 34:36.327

is getting anything he wants

35:49.641 --> 35:51.210
from the U. S. government.

35:51.243 --> 35:53.682
And when he finds out
that the U. S. government

35:53.716 --> 35:57.557
just lost his man again,
heads are gonna roll.

35:57.590 --> 36:00.362
I do not know exactly
what happened out there,

36:00.395 --> 36:03.936
but after watching you
just so clearly intervene

36:03.969 --> 36:06.340
and help Chase escape
the first time,

36:06.374 --> 36:07.610
I'm-a go out on a limb

36:07.643 --> 36:10.415

today wasn't an accident.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.625

36:33.595 --> 36:36.768
You're the second person
to tell me that this week.

36:41.477 --> 36:45.786
-So?
-HARPER: Why would anyone
from Langley choose you,

36:45.820 --> 36:48.859
an unqualified busybody
with no friends,

36:48.892 --> 36:51.531
no network,

36:51.565 --> 36:54.336
to lead an operation
this important?

36:54.369 --> 36:57.476
I could never make any sense
of it till right now.

36:57.510 --> 36:59.981
No one at Langley chose you.

37:01.852 --> 37:03.922
Faraz Hamzad did.

37:04.891 --> 37:06.595
He asked for you himself.

37:06.628 --> 37:09.801
Or someone just like you,
at least.

37:09.834 --> 37:11.805
Someone who would
beat the bushes,

37:11.838 --> 37:14.744
ask questions,
dig things out of the dirt.

37:14.778 --> 37:17.416
I figured
this was a revenge story.

37:17.449 --> 37:20.355
Figured that Hamzad
wanted Chase alive

37:20.388 --> 37:22.760
so he could kill him himself.

37:22.794 --> 37:24.864
But maybe Faraz Hamzad

37:24.898 --> 37:27.904
wanted Chase delivered alive,

37:27.937 --> 37:30.910
yeah, and wanted
the nosiest motherfucker

37:30.943 --> 37:33.715
in the history of the CIA
to do the delivering

37:33.749 --> 37:36.788
because Faraz Hamzad
has questions

37:36.822 --> 37:38.491
that he wants answered.

37:38.525 --> 37:39.761
There's something
he wants to know.

37:39.794 --> 37:41.297
Tell me I'm wrong.

37:41.330 --> 37:43.034
-Listen, if...
-HARPER: Don't bother.

37:43.067 --> 37:44.771
I'm not wrong.

37:44.804 --> 37:47.510
But what the hell
kind of questions does he have?

37:47.543 --> 37:49.346
I know what started all this.

37:49.379 --> 37:52.954
It's ugly, it's dangerous,
but there's no mystery to it.

37:53.956 --> 37:55.458
What do you know?

38:01.070 --> 38:02.540
30 years ago,

38:02.573 --> 38:05.613
Dan Chase stole
Faraz Hamzad's wife,

38:05.646 --> 38:06.948
and I helped him do it.

38:06.982 --> 38:09.086
That's it.
That's the story.

38:09.119 --> 38:11.357
That's why we're here.

38:13.361 --> 38:15.031
30 years ago,

38:15.064 --> 38:18.539
a woman living in the Hindu Kush
met an American,

38:18.572 --> 38:19.941
started fucking him,

38:19.974 --> 38:21.878
saw a chance for a better life

38:21.912 --> 38:24.551
and easier access to a Walmart.

38:24.584 --> 38:27.557
So she left her warlord husband

38:27.590 --> 38:29.928
and followed the American
back home.

38:29.961 --> 38:31.631
And here we are.

38:32.967 --> 38:35.371
But what is Hamzad hoping for,

38:35.405 --> 38:37.543
that after all this time,
he'll find her

38:37.577 --> 38:40.983
and, what, just spirit her away?

38:41.016 --> 38:43.689
She's been dead for years.

38:43.722 --> 38:46.093
Either he's got
some serious smelling salts

38:46.126 --> 38:47.630
-or...
-Stop it.

38:57.683 --> 39:00.388
This isn't getting us anywhere.

39:01.691 --> 39:03.695
We're heading
in the wrong direction.

39:05.031 --> 39:09.741
Dan Chase profiles
as a true believer.

39:09.774 --> 39:12.813
Somebody who fights for causes.

39:12.847 --> 39:16.120
A guy that absolutely,
at no matter what cost,

39:16.153 --> 39:18.157
has to believe
that he is on the right side

39:18.190 --> 39:20.963
of whatever fight he's in.

39:20.996 --> 39:22.533
A guy like that,

39:22.567 --> 39:24.469
the kind of woman
that would follow him

39:24.504 --> 39:26.473
halfway across the world,

39:26.508 --> 39:28.010
their story is going to be

39:28.044 --> 39:30.849
a lot more complicated
than that.

39:31.885 --> 39:33.689
And if you're right

39:33.722 --> 39:37.128
and Hamzad
is chasing answers here,

39:37.162 --> 39:39.934
then we have to find out
what the questions are.

39:40.869 --> 39:43.542
And the only way to do that
is to ask him ourselves.

39:45.879 --> 39:48.184
Ask him-- him who?

39:48.217 --> 39:50.556
Hamzad.

39:51.524 --> 39:53.662
(chuckles)
Come on.

39:54.631 --> 39:57.570
I'm supposed to believe that you
can't get a message to Hamzad?

39:57.603 --> 40:00.041
Not can I.
Why would I?

40:00.074 --> 40:01.611
ANGELA:
And what's the alternative--

40:01.645 --> 40:04.182
you go back there
and admit you failed?

40:04.216 --> 40:06.788
Or you don't fail

40:06.821 --> 40:08.457
and the three of us

40:08.491 --> 40:10.729
get Hamzad the answers
that he's looking for.

40:12.065 --> 40:13.669
We put the genie
back in the bottle

40:13.702 --> 40:15.739
and everyone wins.

40:19.112 --> 40:20.816

the house.

40:34.911 --> 40:36.648

there might still be someone

40:36.681 --> 40:38.084
-in the house.
-HARPER: Why?

40:38.117 --> 40:39.621

in one of the windows.
