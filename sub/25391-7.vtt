WEBVTT

00:02.820 --> 00:04.725
Welcome back to Roman

00:04.750 --> 00:07.292
candle baseball World Series.

00:07.761 --> 00:09.563
Sam Duvet at the bat.

00:09.811 --> 00:11.580
They've just integrated the league.

00:11.613 --> 00:14.410
He's coming to us from
the Roman candle baseball

00:14.410 --> 00:15.557
negro leagues.

00:15.696 --> 00:16.768
It's a proud day for me.

00:16.823 --> 00:18.772
He was not very good there,

00:18.838 --> 00:21.700
but he is fantastic with the whites.

00:21.725 --> 00:23.284
I feel like Superman on Earth.

00:23.788 --> 00:25.482
I got powers here, baby.

00:25.790 --> 00:29.026
Lot of folks in the stands
not happy with the decision.

00:29.369 --> 00:31.629
Get him off the field!

00:31.662 --> 00:33.564
This a white man's sport!

00:33.598 --> 00:35.271
They'll steal our women!

00:36.634 --> 00:38.936
Say hello to a new day,
you white pieces of shit!

00:38.970 --> 00:40.517
Here comes the first pitch!

00:41.824 --> 00:42.844
Strike one!

00:43.903 --> 00:44.864
Strike two!

00:45.653 --> 00:46.611
Crap!

00:46.885 --> 00:48.846
Oh sh... Chrissy, spray him!

00:48.880 --> 00:50.911
Spray him, Chrissy, spray him off!

00:52.383 --> 00:53.490
Dumbass.

00:53.490 --> 00:55.686
Actually, all y'all
are a bunch of dumbasses

00:55.720 --> 00:57.522
- if you ask me.
- Hey, Lois.

00:57.555 --> 00:58.663
Hey, girl.

00:59.557 --> 01:01.726
Tim Cramblin, you still here?

01:01.883 --> 01:03.639
Hey, Lois.

01:03.928 --> 01:05.730
I've been working the
line next to your wife

01:05.763 --> 01:08.766
for the last ten years,
and every day I ask her

01:08.800 --> 01:11.596
when is she gonna dump your sorry ass?

01:11.621 --> 01:14.072
- What does she say?
- She says she's not, right?

01:14.735 --> 01:16.774
Hey, Sam.

01:16.808 --> 01:18.076
Hey, Lois.

01:18.076 --> 01:20.445
If you're not careful,
I'm gonna have to leave my husband

01:20.445 --> 01:21.803
and run away with you.

01:21.981 --> 01:23.648
Actually, I've got 30 seconds right now.

01:23.681 --> 01:25.216
You want to show me what you got?

01:25.250 --> 01:26.651
Oh, I'm gonna need more time than that.

01:26.684 --> 01:28.100
Like at least a half hour.

01:29.554 --> 01:31.656
Yeah, that's because he
gonna have to take a dump

01:31.689 --> 01:33.191
before and after.

01:33.224 --> 01:35.059
First of all, how do you know that?

01:35.093 --> 01:36.686
Second, shut up.

01:36.866 --> 01:38.078
You want to make me?

01:38.078 --> 01:39.199
Do I have to?

01:41.014 --> 01:42.437
Don't hit her in the face, Sam.

01:42.437 --> 01:44.339
Actually go ahead. It might shake

01:44.371 --> 01:45.606
that shit back into place.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.610
You think I enjoy working
next to you every day?

01:49.643 --> 01:51.778
You're like a chimney with titties!

01:51.812 --> 01:53.680
Yeah, old baggy ones too!

01:53.714 --> 01:55.411
You better look out,
Tommy Hearns will come by

01:55.436 --> 01:56.617
and bounce those things around like...

01:58.819 --> 02:01.254
Yeah, Lois, you're no prize yourself.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.256
You're pretty old, you
smoke, you eat like crap,

02:03.522 --> 02:05.292
- Frickin' disgusting.
- Tim!

02:05.389 --> 02:07.461
How is that different from
what you guys were doing?

02:07.494 --> 02:09.863
It can't be like real, Tim.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.398
I see you still don't have kids.

02:11.431 --> 02:12.833
You still shooting blanks, Tim?

02:12.866 --> 02:14.801
Heck no, I'm packed full of sperm.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.537
They're huge too. I can feel
them inside me right now.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.306
Sometimes they hurt when they blast out.

02:19.339 --> 02:20.667
Tim, come on.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.443
I'm joking.
I don't know how to do it, I guess.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.631
Hey.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.685
Can we have one of those?

02:31.718 --> 02:33.632
Oh, by all means.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.956
Ladies, be my guest.

02:36.708 --> 02:39.337
"Be my guest." You proper!

02:39.693 --> 02:41.728
- Excuse me?
- You talk proper.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.294
What do you even mean?

02:43.372 --> 02:45.460
The way you talk is proper.

02:46.872 --> 02:49.621
Proper? Shoot, girl.

02:51.052 --> 02:52.101
Far from it.

02:52.126 --> 02:54.741
- Oh, okay.
- Is this your house?

02:55.442 --> 02:57.087
Yeah, this the crib right here.

02:58.478 --> 03:01.834
This is my homegirl Jasmin,
but she got a boyfriend.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.114
I'm Angel, though.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.520
Oh, for real... oh, word?

03:06.553 --> 03:07.621
Word.

03:07.654 --> 03:08.689
I'm Sam.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.073
Oooh!

03:13.173 --> 03:15.811
I mean, that's it? Shoot.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.125
I mean that last one,
though, was spectacular.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.086
Sam! Did you see that last one?

03:21.414 --> 03:22.695
Whoa!

03:23.172 --> 03:25.141
Yo, patriotic as a muh.

03:25.978 --> 03:27.997
Happy Fourth of July, everybody!

03:28.108 --> 03:29.910
Happy Fourth, Lois.

03:30.301 --> 03:32.477
I love you, you little bony bitch!

- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.625
- How you doing?
- I'm holding up.

03:44.951 --> 03:46.812
Hang in there, dum-dum. Love you.

03:48.287 --> 03:51.348
Guys, this is Elwood. He was Lois' husband.

03:52.301 --> 03:55.079
Oh, we're so sorry for your loss.
We loved Lois very much.

03:56.379 --> 03:58.505
Damn emphysema. If only I told her not

03:58.538 --> 04:00.262
to smoke that last cigarette.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.644
I don't think it was the
last cigarette that did it.

04:04.186 --> 04:05.479
Plus she ate like shit.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.527
Tim!

04:06.698 --> 04:08.316
Let us know if you ever need anything.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.620
Someone to hang out with
or just someone to talk to.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.354
Tomorrow.

04:13.591 --> 04:14.622
Huh?

04:14.655 --> 04:16.156
Well, let's hang out tomorrow.

04:18.849 --> 04:19.904
Okay.

04:20.488 --> 04:21.784
Yeah, that'll be nice.

04:23.085 --> 04:24.565
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

04:24.598 --> 04:26.273
What in the world?

04:26.432 --> 04:29.795
Move on! This was her
final wish. We respected it.

04:30.118 --> 04:31.458
Now just move on!

04:33.361 --> 04:34.944
So... waxy.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.092
- She looks lovely.
- Thank you.

04:39.077 --> 04:40.356
Whoa!

04:52.345 --> 04:53.492
Good afternoon.

04:54.324 --> 04:57.263
Lois Warfield was a dedicated friend,

04:57.665 --> 05:00.499
a loving wife, and a
proud union autoworker.

05:01.065 --> 05:04.670
And while we mourn her loss,
let's look at the bright side.

05:05.178 --> 05:07.515
God's car's gonna be running
a little smoother tonight.

05:09.568 --> 05:11.437
And trust me, you know the big man

05:11.470 --> 05:13.372
won't be driving an import. Amen.

05:15.671 --> 05:16.875
It's not funny.

05:16.909 --> 05:18.710
They're just laughing 'cause he's a pastor.

05:18.744 --> 05:20.479
I know, he's capitalizing
on these people's sorrow.

05:20.512 --> 05:21.920
It's bull[BLEEP].

05:21.921 --> 05:23.880
Some of Lois' friends and family have asked

05:23.905 --> 05:25.114
to say a few words.

05:32.061 --> 05:35.268
Looking in the crowd at
the faces of all my coworkers,

05:35.932 --> 05:38.770
I'm gonna miss all the shit
that Lois said about you

05:38.770 --> 05:39.838
every single day.

05:41.877 --> 05:45.118
I mean, Fred, with Lois
gone, who I'm gonna laugh with

05:45.156 --> 05:46.575
about your double chins?

05:46.816 --> 05:47.984
Double chins?

05:48.333 --> 05:49.681
That's muscle, playa.

05:49.919 --> 05:51.992
A lot of people thought Lois was mean,

05:52.397 --> 05:54.001
but I knew with every jab,

05:54.351 --> 05:55.638
every insult,

05:56.366 --> 05:58.319
it was just her way of saying

05:59.135 --> 06:00.324
"I love you."

06:12.241 --> 06:14.345
I don't know what I'm
gonna do without Lois.

06:19.048 --> 06:20.588
Who's gonna make my sandwich?

06:22.380 --> 06:23.817
Who's gonna make my bed?

06:27.392 --> 06:29.422
Mm? That's it?

06:30.059 --> 06:31.805
- Okay, then.
- That's all he's gonna say.

06:32.061 --> 06:34.163
And we gotta hang out
with this guy tomorrow.

06:34.197 --> 06:36.165
- Well, you do.
- Thank you, brother Elwood.

06:36.199 --> 06:37.808
- Thank you.
- No problem.

06:38.347 --> 06:40.236
It was a lovely service. Thank you.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.572
Thank you, thank you. I'm
sorry again for your loss.

06:42.605 --> 06:43.649
- Thank you.
- All right.

06:43.649 --> 06:45.385
Yeah, I just want to say
it was a beautiful service,

06:45.418 --> 06:47.616
but you and I both know
you wouldn't have gotten

06:47.641 --> 06:49.612
those laughs if you weren't a pastor.

06:50.026 --> 06:51.248
I'm sorry?

06:51.274 --> 06:53.453
Oh, it's no big deal. I don't care.

06:53.908 --> 06:56.112
I'm just saying you're not actually funny,

06:56.146 --> 06:58.485
so don't feel proud about today.

06:59.015 --> 07:00.316
People grieve in their own ways, son.

07:00.350 --> 07:01.885
- No. No.
- I just wanted to say, beautiful service.

07:01.918 --> 07:02.903
Oh, thank you.

07:02.903 --> 07:04.303
I hope you don't think you
deserved any of those laughs...

07:04.303 --> 07:05.636
- No, I just told him. I just told him.
- Oh, okay.

07:05.636 --> 07:06.780
I just gave him the heads up.

07:06.780 --> 07:08.078
Okay, yeah, that's the
worst kind of hack there is.

07:08.078 --> 07:09.132
- Beautiful service, though!
- Beautiful!

07:09.132 --> 07:10.467
- Thank you again, gentlemen.
- My condolences.

07:10.491 --> 07:11.917
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, yeah, sure.

07:12.555 --> 07:13.889
Can't wait for tomorrow, Tim.

07:14.705 --> 07:17.421
Yeah, me neither. I'll be by then.

07:17.660 --> 07:19.052
And you'll stay a while?

07:20.767 --> 07:21.673
Yes.

07:26.281 --> 07:28.979
Ugh. You invited Angel to a funeral?

07:28.979 --> 07:30.314
Nah, she's just picking me up.

07:30.347 --> 07:31.667
I wanted her to see me in this suit.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.425
I mean, you do look good in that suit.

07:33.610 --> 07:35.607
Oh, and some buffs!

07:35.946 --> 07:36.932
Oh!

07:37.071 --> 07:39.107
You're ready? I'm sorry about your friend.

07:39.178 --> 07:41.806
No, no, it's cool, it's
cool. I mean, she flown.

07:42.710 --> 07:45.013
But I tell you what, baby,
why don't you go grab the whip.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.715
Uh... I gotta holla at
my... my baby right here

07:47.749 --> 07:48.883
about some business real quick.

07:48.917 --> 07:50.213
- Okay.
- All right.

07:52.313 --> 07:53.922
- Shut up, Tim.
- All right, then.

07:53.955 --> 07:55.513
- All right?
- You're gonna get busted.

07:55.513 --> 07:57.560
I'm not gonna get busted.
I can keep this up.

07:57.603 --> 07:58.681
- Sam!
- Huh?

07:58.681 --> 08:00.416
- You comin'?
- Shoot, baby,

08:00.449 --> 08:02.208
I ain't said nothing
but a mother[BLEEP] word.

08:05.869 --> 08:06.927
See ya, Sam.

08:08.326 --> 08:11.329
Yeah, baby. No, oh, word? Shoot!

08:11.548 --> 08:12.838
Yeah.

08:13.282 --> 08:15.355
Yeah, yeah, no. It ain't
nothing but a thing.

08:15.845 --> 08:18.039
All right. Yeah, I'll run through then.

08:18.783 --> 08:21.318
All right, peace. That was Angel.

08:21.352 --> 08:23.521
Yeah, I know, because of how you talked.

08:23.554 --> 08:24.689
Did it sound natural?

08:24.722 --> 08:27.161
No, you're gonna get busted.

08:27.286 --> 08:29.810
Shoot, I'm gonna be just fine,

08:29.810 --> 08:32.034
pl-pl-pep
boy.

08:32.328 --> 08:33.496
- Pep boy?
- Oh, no.

08:33.530 --> 08:35.299
Uh-oh!

08:35.332 --> 08:37.125
See you later. I'm going to work.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.283
Okay. You're gonna be all right?

08:38.283 --> 08:40.018
It's gonna be tough
working with someone new.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.623
Yeah, I know, but I'm
gonna go in with an open mind.

08:42.648 --> 08:43.649
- Mm-hmm.
- She won't be Lois,

08:43.683 --> 08:45.451
but no one is.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.307
Ah, but, Chrissy, think of how hard

08:47.307 --> 08:49.181
it's gonna be on your new
linemate when she finds out...

08:50.522 --> 08:51.522
Never mind.

08:52.075 --> 08:53.080
What?

08:53.295 --> 08:55.064
It was just a perfectly-worded slam

08:55.089 --> 08:56.281
that would've totally devastated you,

08:56.315 --> 08:58.099
but you're grieving, so...

08:58.750 --> 08:59.918
- Thank you, Sam.
- Thank you, Sam.

08:59.951 --> 09:01.520
- You're welcome.
- So nice of you.

09:01.553 --> 09:03.322
- Bye. I love you.
- Love you too.

09:11.663 --> 09:13.560
- Hey, I'm here.
- Come on in,

09:13.752 --> 09:14.916
I'll show you around the house.

09:14.941 --> 09:16.235
Okay. Sure.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.336
This used to be our room.

09:24.283 --> 09:25.361
Pictures.

09:26.085 --> 09:27.150
Lamp.

09:27.752 --> 09:29.074
That used to be our bed.

09:30.349 --> 09:33.885
Sorry it's a mess, but
Lois used to make the bed.

09:34.519 --> 09:35.558
Now,

09:36.561 --> 09:37.700
she's gone.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.452
Hey, I can make the bed for you, Elwood.

09:42.427 --> 09:43.578
You'd do that for me?

09:43.603 --> 09:45.159
Yeah, I'd be happy to. Yes.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.160
Wow, look at you.

09:52.871 --> 09:54.302
You're a pro at that.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.972
Oh, I don't know about that.

09:56.541 --> 09:57.484
Thank you.

09:59.034 --> 10:00.212
This is the kitchen.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.788
Lois used to make sandwiches for me

10:02.788 --> 10:04.160
in here when she was alive.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.988
Now she's sandwiches for worms.

10:07.499 --> 10:08.897
I sure am hungry.

10:10.005 --> 10:11.789
I can make you a sandwich, Elwood.

10:11.789 --> 10:13.658
Well, you were so good at making that bed.

10:13.691 --> 10:15.492
Shut up.

10:18.362 --> 10:19.864
You're a good man, Tim.

10:19.897 --> 10:21.499
Yeah, well, everybody loved Lois,

10:21.532 --> 10:23.034
so it's no problem at all.

10:26.479 --> 10:28.553
What's the ETA on that sandwich?

10:30.089 --> 10:32.586
- It's coming.
- Like five?

10:33.319 --> 10:35.346
- Ten?
- Probably ten.

10:35.379 --> 10:36.670
Five would be better.

10:37.861 --> 10:38.923
Okay, yeah.

10:39.784 --> 10:42.453
I'll see what I can do.
Everybody loved Lois very much.

10:49.266 --> 10:52.103
Oh, baby, how about "Star Century Prime"?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.631
You know? I heard it just came out today,

10:53.664 --> 10:54.932
it looks good as mud.

10:54.966 --> 10:56.500
No, let's just go see "Fat Bieber."

10:56.808 --> 10:58.301
Yeah, it does look hilarious.

10:58.302 --> 10:59.790
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.859
But you know, I heard "Star Century Prime"

11:01.892 --> 11:04.462
is 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.
I mean that's consensus.

11:04.495 --> 11:07.140
Well, you know, Jasmin
saw "Fat Bieber" yesterday,

11:07.165 --> 11:09.801
- and she said it was real funny.
- Jasmin said that, huh?

11:09.835 --> 11:12.604
Yeah, well, I guess she knows
more than Leonard Maltin.

11:12.637 --> 11:14.506
Leonard Maltin!

11:14.539 --> 11:16.575
No, you know what? Let's
go to "Fat Bieber" then.

11:16.608 --> 11:18.710
Shoot, we might mess
around and see two movies.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.712
- You play too much.
- No.

11:24.883 --> 11:26.428
Yo, Chrissy!

11:27.052 --> 11:28.335
Bring it in, bring it in.

11:28.335 --> 11:30.522
Chrissy, this is Margaret,
your new linemate.

11:30.555 --> 11:31.934
Margaret, this is Chrissy.

11:31.934 --> 11:34.637
She gonna be showing you the
ropes, all right? All right.

11:34.803 --> 11:36.982
- Hey, Margaret.
- Chrissy, nice to meet you.

11:37.512 --> 11:39.414
You check out Fred and his double chins?

11:39.448 --> 11:41.650
His neck lookin' like a sideways butt.

11:41.683 --> 11:43.153
He was very nice to me.

11:43.405 --> 11:45.378
Yeah, sure, sorry.

11:45.519 --> 11:47.554
My old linemate and I
used to make fun of people.

11:47.579 --> 11:48.947
Just our way of showing love.

11:49.061 --> 11:50.863
Well, I was bullied as a kid,

11:50.896 --> 11:53.257
so that sort of thing isn't fun for me.

11:53.340 --> 11:56.270
- Oh, sorry.
- Kids can be so mean.

11:56.468 --> 11:58.871
Kids made fun of me because
my head was always in a book.

11:58.904 --> 12:00.973
My hairline started at my eyebrows.

12:03.108 --> 12:04.943
That must've been very hard for you.

12:05.270 --> 12:06.346
It was.

12:06.371 --> 12:08.508
So you were like Moe
from "The Three Stooges?"

12:10.649 --> 12:11.620
Shit!

12:12.989 --> 12:16.756
Okay. Back door's locked
and I checked the crawlspace.

12:17.012 --> 12:18.388
Nobody in there.

12:18.651 --> 12:21.827
Well, Elwood, I've had a
great entire Sunday with you.

12:21.860 --> 12:25.497
Do you mind staying until
I fall asleep? Lois used to.

12:25.531 --> 12:26.865
Yeah, but she used to live here.

12:27.072 --> 12:28.316
And she died here.

12:32.349 --> 12:34.006
I don't know how I'm
ever gonna get to sleep

12:34.039 --> 12:36.349
without the smell of smoke in here.

12:36.575 --> 12:39.611
- I'm not smoking, Elwood.
- I don't smoke.

12:41.914 --> 12:43.004
Nighty night.

12:46.085 --> 12:49.989
Oh, no! Yo, I grew up and got fat, yo!

12:51.089 --> 12:53.250
I'm gonna have to go back
in Usher's time machine

12:53.250 --> 12:56.195
and warn myself not to smoke weed!

12:56.228 --> 12:58.030
Mm-hmm! Don't you do it, Justin!

12:58.063 --> 12:59.665
You smoke that kush!

13:00.340 --> 13:01.842
Babe, I'm trying to listen, okay?

13:01.867 --> 13:03.235
If we're gonna talk, we're gonna talk,

13:03.268 --> 13:04.733
but if we're gonna watch the
movie, let's just watch the movie.

13:04.733 --> 13:07.234
Okay, here I go! Come on, Sammich.

13:07.234 --> 13:08.583
Man, that [BLEEP] fat!

13:11.007 --> 13:12.506
Let's maybe leave the
jokes to the professionals.

13:12.531 --> 13:13.746
Man, turn your ass around!

13:15.809 --> 13:18.373
I will have you ejected, just so you know.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.832
He wild!

13:21.857 --> 13:24.835
- Yeah.
- Wild! Wild!

13:25.117 --> 13:26.644
Look at how fat he is.

13:30.168 --> 13:31.831
That big ol' fat negro.

13:32.473 --> 13:35.208
Oh! Oh, my God!

13:36.544 --> 13:38.813
Oh! This is amazing!

13:38.847 --> 13:39.929
What?

13:40.060 --> 13:41.495
Uh, we smashing, you know what I mean?

13:41.528 --> 13:42.846
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

13:43.931 --> 13:46.100
Oh, yeah! Talk more to me, daddy!

13:46.133 --> 13:48.002
Nah, dawg.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.104
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
I'm putting in work!

13:50.137 --> 13:51.805
- I'm all up in them guts.
- Oh, no!

13:51.839 --> 13:53.904
- Whoa! Jesus!
- I'm sorry.

13:54.118 --> 13:56.420
Sam, if Dad heard you talking like that,

13:56.454 --> 13:57.755
he would beat your ass.

13:57.789 --> 13:59.439
I would knock Dad out.

13:59.912 --> 14:01.459
I mean, don't tell Dad.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.761
Sam, I don't know why you're acting

14:03.795 --> 14:05.029
like somebody you're not,

14:05.062 --> 14:06.863
just to impress some hoochie mama.

14:07.031 --> 14:09.298
Chrissy! "Hoochie mama"?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.478
Shame on you for judging people,

14:11.478 --> 14:13.371
when you yourself are
the biggest piece of shit

14:13.404 --> 14:14.478
I've ever seen.

14:14.503 --> 14:16.776
Sam, her linemate just died.

14:16.861 --> 14:18.543
Ah, a week ago. Gloves are off.

14:18.576 --> 14:20.119
She's got a new linemate. Who cares?

14:20.119 --> 14:22.880
But I can't say anything
to Margaret or she'll cry.

14:23.057 --> 14:24.159
What do you mean?

14:24.291 --> 14:27.244
She was bullied as a kid,
so I can't say shit about her

14:27.269 --> 14:28.530
or anybody else.

14:28.859 --> 14:32.267
The other day, Fred farted
so hard his back went out.

14:34.219 --> 14:35.556
She didn't even giggle!

14:35.556 --> 14:39.409
She said, "It's not
funny! He's actually hurt!"

14:42.447 --> 14:44.887
I'm sorry, babe. That sucks.

14:45.044 --> 14:47.256
He's getting workman's comp.

14:49.293 --> 14:51.903
- See? It's funny!
- Yes!

14:54.800 --> 14:55.859
Lunchtime.

14:56.268 --> 14:58.859
Mm-mm-mm! Look
at that hamper.

14:59.026 --> 15:02.423
You know, Lois used to do the laundry.

15:02.796 --> 15:05.643
Yeah, yeah, she did everything around here.

15:05.799 --> 15:06.937
And you know what?

15:15.976 --> 15:17.619
I am not Lois!

15:18.327 --> 15:22.030
Elwood, it's time for you to
start making your own damn bed!

15:22.838 --> 15:23.939
It's time for you to start making

15:23.972 --> 15:25.358
your own damn sandwiches.

15:26.161 --> 15:29.650
It's not hard! Just put two pieces of bread

15:29.675 --> 15:31.401
around slices of meat!

15:31.805 --> 15:33.940
- Is this it?
- No, that's a ball!

15:33.974 --> 15:36.109
Come on, I feel like you're
getting it wrong on purpose.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.226
No, I'm not! I can't do it.

15:38.226 --> 15:40.395
Well, then you're gonna have
to figure this shit out, man.

15:40.510 --> 15:42.412
One day, I'll die and Chrissy
will have to figure out

15:42.445 --> 15:44.076
how to go on without me!

15:44.309 --> 15:46.147
- Maybe she could remarry.
- No!

15:46.508 --> 15:49.578
If your spouse dies and you
remarry, you go to Hell, man!

15:50.782 --> 15:51.816
Sorry. Come here.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.375
Good-bye, Elwood.

15:57.197 --> 15:58.232
You can do this.

16:13.704 --> 16:16.674
Margaret, I'm sorry we
got off on the wrong foot.

16:16.707 --> 16:18.274
But I can't work in silence every day.

16:18.274 --> 16:20.111
I have to talk, or I'll go crazy.

16:20.144 --> 16:22.289
You want to make fun of
people. I don't like bullies.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.329
I know.

16:23.329 --> 16:25.781
It's because my hairline
used to start at my eyebrows.

16:25.806 --> 16:28.368
Oh, I know, and it
sucks that happened to you.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.111
They used to say the meanest things to me.

16:30.111 --> 16:31.947
They used to call me "Bride of Chewbacca."

16:33.224 --> 16:36.252
Maybe you should tell me
what else they would call you.

16:36.252 --> 16:37.981
You know, to get it off of your chest.

16:38.221 --> 16:40.638
They used to call me
the Forehead-less Horseman.

16:40.790 --> 16:42.070
Assholes!

16:42.292 --> 16:43.441
'Sup, ladies?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.465
What do you think those jerks would've said

16:47.465 --> 16:48.707
about Little Joey?

16:48.707 --> 16:50.917
Oh, man, they'd probably
say something like,

16:51.076 --> 16:52.303
"Little Joey's so short,

16:52.425 --> 16:54.821
he needs a ladder to
go down on Tinkerbell."

16:54.875 --> 16:57.048
You know, like he'd have
to climb up that ladder

16:57.082 --> 16:58.837
to [BLEEP] out her vagina
or something like that.

16:58.837 --> 17:01.524
That is so mean. What do you
think they'd say about Fred?

17:01.524 --> 17:04.094
They'd say, "Fred's neck is so weak,

17:04.127 --> 17:06.287
he has to ask his tits for lunch money."

17:09.781 --> 17:10.950
What up, y'all?

17:11.090 --> 17:13.086
This my man, Sam.

17:13.086 --> 17:14.862
Ha. 'Sup, 'sup, 'sup?

17:14.979 --> 17:16.800
Ooh, y'all... y'all drinkin', huh?

17:16.825 --> 17:18.685
Uh, let me get a Hpno.

17:18.926 --> 17:20.398
You know what I'm saying?

17:20.398 --> 17:23.236
Yo, Sam, your pants
tight as hell, my [BLEEP]

17:23.269 --> 17:25.538
Yeah, that's funny you mentioned that,

17:25.570 --> 17:28.540
'cause this is the only pants
I had that was, uh... clean.

17:28.574 --> 17:31.277
I went... I bought some...
I thought I was getting these

17:31.310 --> 17:33.961
in a XXL, and I got home, these are medium.

17:34.028 --> 17:36.631
I was like, I gotta go to the store

17:36.664 --> 17:38.533
and talk to these people face to face.

17:38.566 --> 17:40.902
So I went to the store, I was like, "Hey!"

17:40.935 --> 17:43.871
Hey, my brah, uh... You gave
me the wrong size pants."

17:43.905 --> 17:45.706
And it was like, "Nothing
I can do for you, man."

17:45.740 --> 17:46.939
I was like, "Really, bro?"

17:47.876 --> 17:50.247
And then, so I was like,
"Let me talk to your manager."

17:50.379 --> 17:52.581
And then the manager
came out, and it's like,

17:52.615 --> 17:54.984
"Nothing I can do for you.
We have no refund policy."

17:55.212 --> 17:57.247
So, I was like, "You about to come up

17:57.281 --> 17:58.751
with a refund for me, ...."

18:00.457 --> 18:02.319
You ever notice how some
folks say the word [BLEEP],

18:02.352 --> 18:03.687
it just doesn't sound right?

18:03.720 --> 18:05.756
- Leave him alone, Ray.
- Okay?

18:05.789 --> 18:07.991
'Cause he may talk white,
but he's still cute.

18:08.025 --> 18:09.065
Actually, I'm sexy,

18:09.240 --> 18:11.142
but I don't even really talk white, baby.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.935
- I don't even know...
- Sam.

18:14.447 --> 18:15.645
Listen to your voicemail.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.883
<i>Yello, you've reached Sam Duvet.</i>

18:18.125 --> 18:20.770
<i>You know what to do, and
that is leave a message.</i>

18:23.420 --> 18:25.943
"Yello, you've reached
Frasier. Leave a message."

18:27.838 --> 18:30.374
All right! You got me!

18:30.600 --> 18:33.467
I talk "proper"!

18:33.957 --> 18:36.691
I can't even see with
these on. So, okay. So what?

18:36.691 --> 18:39.915
So because I talk proper
that means I talk white?

18:40.017 --> 18:42.739
And then thus, to speak improperly

18:42.739 --> 18:45.221
means you speak black?
Are we okay with this?

18:45.415 --> 18:47.751
Are we okay with this as a people? Hmm?

18:49.245 --> 18:51.558
You know what's cool?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.675
Being your ding-dong self.

18:54.236 --> 18:55.365
How 'bout that?

18:55.917 --> 18:57.185
Unless you are being yourselves,

18:57.218 --> 18:58.995
which I... you probably are,

18:58.996 --> 19:01.173
I don't know! I don't
care! I guess my point is...

19:01.198 --> 19:03.792
Is just have a good time! Cheers!

19:05.314 --> 19:07.416
Oh, heavens, is there
pineapple in this Hpnotiq?

19:07.449 --> 19:08.951
I'm allergic to pineapple!

19:08.984 --> 19:10.552
It's not funny!

19:10.586 --> 19:12.101
It's a legitimate allergy!

19:12.101 --> 19:15.104
I need an antihistamine or an EpiPen!

19:15.597 --> 19:18.193
Once I got her talking,
Margaret never stopped.

19:18.451 --> 19:20.630
Today was actually a pretty fun day.

19:20.630 --> 19:22.930
Chrissy, you just
tricked her into being mean.

19:23.826 --> 19:25.299
You're a bad person.

19:25.653 --> 19:27.655
Go eat pineapples, you fat head.

19:27.688 --> 19:28.783
Shut up.

19:30.324 --> 19:32.571
Hey, this is Sam. Leave a message.

19:33.019 --> 19:34.420
Why do we still have to do this?

19:34.453 --> 19:35.765
I thought Angel dumped you.

19:36.793 --> 19:40.132
You've reached Sam Duvet.
Leave your thing at the bizzay!

19:40.596 --> 19:43.796
- Just use your regular voice.
- I'm trying!

19:44.215 --> 19:47.251
Hey, you've reached Slammin' Sammy Duvet!

19:47.285 --> 19:50.737
I'm not here right now, because
I'm out rocking the jocks!

19:51.489 --> 19:53.097
- There it is.
- There you go. Thank you.

19:53.168 --> 19:54.492
- That's all I ask.
- That's it.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.027
- That one felt right.
- Use your regular voice.

19:56.061 --> 19:57.144
- That was it.
- That's normal me.

20:18.458 --> 20:21.189
No, I'm on my own now.

20:21.561 --> 20:23.119
I have to do this for myself.

20:36.961 --> 20:39.414
Elwood Warfield was a dedicated friend,

20:39.854 --> 20:40.912
a loving husband,

20:41.374 --> 20:44.377
and though unemployed,
he made life his job,

20:44.576 --> 20:47.798
which I guess he's now been fired from.

20:49.705 --> 20:51.440
- It's funny.
- That's a good joke.

20:51.474 --> 20:52.508
- That was actually funny.
- That was pretty funny.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.536
Damn it.

20:55.056 --> 20:56.840
Yep, it was good.
