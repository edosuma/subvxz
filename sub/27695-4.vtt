00:43.669 --> 00:47.089
II'

00:47.256 --> 00:49.007
<i>"ALBERT".
I must to go to Cambridge</i>

00:49.174 --> 00:50.759
<i>as I have been asked to stand</i>

00:50.926 --> 00:53.887
<i>as chancellor of the university.</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.431
<i>In my absence, I hope
you will follow my advice</i>

00:56.598 --> 00:59.268
<i>and employ a maie tutor
for Bertie.</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:02.437
<i>His behavior has become...
unmanageable.</i>

01:04.356 --> 01:09.319
II'

01:10.237 --> 01:11.363
For the prince.

01:13.532 --> 01:16.577
II'

01:16.743 --> 01:18.036
Mm-hmm,

01:18.203 --> 01:19.413
From the queen, sir.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.248
<i>Berfie's misbehavior</i>

01:21.415 --> 01:22.916
<i>is simply
that he does not fulfill</i>

01:23.083 --> 01:25.627
<i>your very specific expectations</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:26.878
<i>of how a boy should act.</i>

01:27.045 --> 01:28.505
Thank you.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.672
<i>There is no question</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:30.900
<i>of you going to Cambridge today.</i>

01:30.924 --> 01:32.277
<i>Have you forgotten
we are receiving</i>

01:32.301 --> 01:33.677
<i>the foreign ambassadors tonight?</i>

01:33.844 --> 01:36.013
<i>We must present a united front.</i>

01:36.179 --> 01:38.348
II'

01:39.933 --> 01:41.518
<i>ALBERT
By "united front," you mean</i>

01:41.685 --> 01:43.729
<i>another opportunity
for you to indulge your vanity</i>

01:43.895 --> 01:47.524
<i>while I am paraded around
like a show pony.</i>

01:47.691 --> 01:49.359
II'

01:49.526 --> 01:51.194
Sir.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.821
<i>Must I explain again</i>

01:52.988 --> 01:55.198
<i>that since I was forced
to run away to Osborne,</i>

01:55.365 --> 01:57.034
<i>I have had to double my efforts</i>

01:57.200 --> 01:58.702
<i>to show my people
the same devotion</i>

01:58.869 --> 02:00.787
<i>as I show my children?</i>

02:01.955 --> 02:03.624
<i>What you call vanity,</i>

02:03.790 --> 02:05.208
<i>I call duty.</i>

02:05.375 --> 02:07.836
II'

02:08.003 --> 02:11.548
<i>Well,
if you treat your country iike a child,</i>

02:11.715 --> 02:13.842
<i>how will it ever mature?</i>

02:14.009 --> 02:17.137
<i>I, too,
have important' work, Albert,</i>

02:17.304 --> 02:20.474
<i>and that is to show my peopie
their queen is by their side.</i>

02:20.641 --> 02:22.601
Look what I can do
with my new toy!

02:22.768 --> 02:26.146
II'

02:30.067 --> 02:31.193
Your Grace.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.488
<i>'U.</i>

02:35.822 --> 02:37.574
I have been meaning to thank you

02:37.741 --> 02:39.743
for what you did for me
in Osborne.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.412
<i>'U.</i>

02:42.579 --> 02:44.623
Anyone would have done
what I did.

02:44.790 --> 02:49.211
II'

03:01.306 --> 03:02.516
We open in three days.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.980
The place is filthy.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.694
Look.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.532
Look at these windows.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.158
Once they taste
my strawberry tarts,

03:20.325 --> 03:22.045
they won't be looking
out the window, Nancy.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.188
Do you think
we should change the name?

03:31.294 --> 03:32.921
What shall we call it?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.676
The Palace.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.691
It was a joke! You're a chef.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.444
You should know about timing.

03:55.610 --> 03:59.614
II'

04:13.462 --> 04:15.942
Please tell His Royal Highness
our correspondence is at an end.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.735
I believe this letter
is from Mrs-Skew...

04:18.759 --> 04:19.968
Mrs. Francatelli, ma'am.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.731
Is that the best you can do?

04:33.774 --> 04:34.900
Leave us.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.450
You seem out of sorts
lately, Drina.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.743
Could you blame me?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.289
Albert is God knows where,

04:49.456 --> 04:52.250
and the one person
who could do my hair properly

04:52.417 --> 04:55.796
has left me to get married.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.883
It's hopeless.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.343
Don't worry, Drina.

05:01.510 --> 05:02.677
<i>Hm'?</i>

05:02.844 --> 05:05.430
I will never desert you.

05:07.974 --> 05:14.189
II'

05:23.907 --> 05:26.535
II'

05:34.167 --> 05:36.419
<i>Can't you just
give him some medicine, doctor?</i>

05:39.673 --> 05:41.716
Just last night
he was on the street playing,

05:41.883 --> 05:44.094
refusing to go to bed.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.096
Why has the Lord saved me
when my boy...

05:46.263 --> 05:50.183
I'm very sorry to tell you
that your son has cholera,

05:50.350 --> 05:51.810
Mrs. Dolan.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.457
We, we don't know
where it comes from,

05:53.520 --> 05:55.647
only that it acts fast.

05:55.814 --> 06:01.236
Now, do,
do you remember who he was with yesterday?

06:01.403 --> 06:03.738
What are you talking about?

06:03.905 --> 06:06.908
Could you tell
me, where, where he had been

06:07.075 --> 06:08.952
before he came home last night?

06:14.249 --> 06:18.128
Do you want your son's life
to mean something?

06:18.295 --> 06:19.796
If you can help me
discover the cause,

06:19.963 --> 06:21.423
he will not die in vain.

06:21.590 --> 06:24.342
II'

06:50.869 --> 06:52.996
Allow me.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.385
William's been at school
for two months now.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.558
Perhaps I could visit him'?

07:15.435 --> 07:16.635
Are you fond of this necklace?

07:24.152 --> 07:26.613
Remember.

07:26.780 --> 07:31.159
Everything you are fond of

07:31.326 --> 07:33.453
belongs to me.

07:33.620 --> 07:39.209
II'

07:41.920 --> 07:48.635
II'

08:05.485 --> 08:06.486
Her Majesty the Queen.

08:06.653 --> 08:12.909
II'

08:13.076 --> 08:17.372
Emma, I do believe the
prince is smiling at the queen.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.792
That is just for the public,
I'm afraid.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.210
Perhaps that's all marriage is.

08:22.377 --> 08:26.965
Presenting
an appropriate facade.

08:27.132 --> 08:30.510
II'

08:37.058 --> 08:38.268
Your Majesty,

08:38.435 --> 08:41.896
may I present His Excellency
the Ambassador to Oud h.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.940
Your Excellency. Your Majesty.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.860
The king of Oudh
sends his felicitations

08:47.027 --> 08:48.254
on the birth
of the Princess Louise.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.380
And he hopes
that you will accept

08:49.404 --> 08:50.739
this gift for the princess.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.742
II'

08:55.702 --> 08:58.329
The gems are said to protect
the wearer from misfortune.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.874
Your Majesty,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.418
may I present His Excellency

09:03.585 --> 09:04.961
the Persian Envoy.

09:06.713 --> 09:10.050
His Excellency
the Portuguese Envoy.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.887
II'

09:20.685 --> 09:21.728
Prime Minister.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.688
I wanted to tell you,
I, I have been asked

09:23.855 --> 09:26.441
to stand as chancellor
at Cambridge University.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.736
<i>Mi dispiace,
signora, un momento.</i>

09:29.903 --> 09:32.256
You'll be a vast improvement
on the previous royal incumbent.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.908
The duke of Gloucester
had great difficulty

09:35.075 --> 09:37.428
in keeping his mouth closed.
Well, there is much to be done.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.829
At Bonn, we studied
botany, geology,

09:39.996 --> 09:41.539
all of the natural sciences.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.434
But at Cambridge, they study
little more than the classics.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.919
Homer and Virgil
made me the man I am today.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.170
Oh, yes, I believe you

09:47.337 --> 09:50.131
studied at, urn,
"Mag-dalene" College...

09:50.298 --> 09:52.092
Lord Palmerston.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.219
You might want to learn
the names of the colleges

09:54.385 --> 09:55.595
before you start telling them

09:55.762 --> 09:56.846
what to study, sir.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.765
"Maucklin," sir.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.350
Thank you.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.976
Of course, the chancellorship

10:02.143 --> 10:03.311
is an honorary position, sir.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.730
It has no executive power.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.000
And Cambridge is not a place
that relishes innovation.

10:08.024 --> 10:11.069
Even more reason
to accept the post.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.113
Ah, you must not worry
about your duties here.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.031
I will support Victoria.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.620
I hope Cambridge
is ready for you, sir.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.082
Thank you.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.087
Your Serene Highness,

10:30.213 --> 10:31.440
have you heard
the "Swedish Nightingale"

10:31.464 --> 10:32.590
sing before?

10:32.757 --> 10:33.925
I have not.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.426
Well then, how fortunate

10:35.593 --> 10:37.554
that you are here tonight.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.390
I don't suppose singers
of her caliber

10:40.557 --> 10:43.560
often make it all the way
over to Langenburg.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.353
But now Europe is at peace,

10:45.520 --> 10:48.398
I'm sure you'll be making
preparations to return there.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.733
Tell me, is your wife here?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.902
I should so like to meet her.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.530
She is very particular
about the company she keeps.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.532
As is the prince.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.450
Believe he has forbidden
the maids of honor

10:59.617 --> 11:02.078
from walking the grounds
unaccompanied.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.789
In case of assignations.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.289
Used the leftovers
from the Chartists' banners.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.333
Isn't much call for them now.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.922
Cuffay's been transported.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.175
Sometimes it feels like
none of it ever happened.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.611
Well, you've made them
look beautiful.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.803
I shall repay the favor one day.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.472
It is you doing me the favor.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.266
Not much keeping me busy
since you left.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.663
I'm troubled by opening
with all of this, Charles.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.166
You've been troubled from
the moment you left the palace.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.461
Please try to remember
what you've got.

12:33.628 --> 12:34.754
Not what you had.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.819
Prime Minister.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.865
Prime Minister.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.951
Sir. Thank you.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.595
Something the matter?

13:24.762 --> 13:26.931
Nothing to concern you
at present, ma'am.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.534
Judging by the look
on the prime minister's face,

13:28.558 --> 13:29.892
I would beg to differ.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.562
I've just been informed
that there is

13:32.729 --> 13:33.813
a cholera outbreak

13:33.980 --> 13:35.815
in Soho.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.984
We thought it was just
a few isolated cases.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.069
I assure you
we're doing all we can.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.197
We're closing
all the graveyards in town,

13:43.364 --> 13:46.743
and opening them in the country,
to prevent any...

13:47.702 --> 13:49.037
mcongestion.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.581
So your suggestion
is to tidy the problem away.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.108
Surely we should be trying to
find out what is causing this.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.877
It's a laudable aim, sir.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.087
But as politicians,
we can't waste our time

13:58.254 --> 14:00.006
with scientific red herrings.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.675
We need to make sure
that the public are reassured.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.720
The last thing we need,

14:05.887 --> 14:08.514
is to have cabs filled
with dead children

14:08.681 --> 14:10.099
outside graveyards.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.976
I don't want my guests

14:12.143 --> 14:13.478
to hear any of this.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.442
Perhaps Miss Lind
could give us an encore?

14:28.034 --> 14:30.536
I think the only
way to get rid of this disease

14:30.703 --> 14:32.497
is to get rid
of all these foreigners.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.752
What do you reckon, Joseph?

14:37.919 --> 14:40.505
I'm sure you have a theory.

14:44.967 --> 14:48.679
All we can do
is protect those in need.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.991
Why would you not
want me to be in a position

15:09.158 --> 15:10.803
where I can make
a real change to this country?

15:10.827 --> 15:12.328
I need you here, Albert.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.139
How can you think of leaving
London at a time like this?

15:14.163 --> 15:15.516
I'm sure you believe
that your presence here,

15:15.540 --> 15:17.083
it will cure the sick.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.252
No, your, your predecessors
may have believed

15:19.419 --> 15:20.938
in such superstitions,
Victoria, but this

15:20.962 --> 15:22.547
is the 19th century!

15:22.713 --> 15:23.899
You are so callous
at the moment.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.467
You know how hard it is for me
without Skerrett.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.362
I suppose that you
believe we are all abandoning you.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.554
I don't recognize you.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.639
Well, I recognize you!

15:33.057 --> 15:34.809
What does that mean?
How could I forget

15:34.976 --> 15:36.894
your warmth?

15:37.061 --> 15:38.479
Your generosity
in times of crisis?

15:38.646 --> 15:39.915
It is what holds
this country together.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.774
I am a queen, Albert!

15:41.941 --> 15:43.401
What is it you fail
to understand?

15:43.568 --> 15:49.657
II'

15:49.824 --> 15:51.993
I can only assure

15:52.160 --> 15:53.369
the Honorable Member

15:53.536 --> 15:55.955
that every precaution
is being taken

15:56.122 --> 16:00.084
to stop this terrible plague
spreading!

16:03.296 --> 16:07.383
<i>This is the third and most
devastating outbreak of cholera</i>

16:07.550 --> 16:12.138
<i>to ravage the streets of London
in the last five years!</i>

16:12.305 --> 16:17.643
<i>127 people have died</i>

16:17.810 --> 16:19.061
within three days

16:19.228 --> 16:22.106
in one single street in Soho.

16:22.273 --> 16:25.443
Half a mile from this House.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.570
II'

16:27.737 --> 16:29.363
<i>I</i> can <i>only</i> repeat!

16:29.530 --> 16:35.244
<i>We are expediting
every remedy we know.</i>

16:42.752 --> 16:47.632
And now His
Royal Highness, and soon, I hope,

16:47.798 --> 16:49.383
to be chancellor
of this university,

16:49.550 --> 16:52.178
will say a few words.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.934
Thank you, Master.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.770
My university in Bonn,

17:00.937 --> 17:04.440
one was not afraid
to challenge tradition.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.567
We should strive
to build a future

17:06.734 --> 17:09.028
that is enlightened by science

17:09.195 --> 17:10.905
and rationality.

17:11.072 --> 17:14.158
The dreaded disease that today
is causing misery in our capital

17:14.325 --> 17:15.535
must be stopped.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.079
But that will only happen
if institutions

17:18.246 --> 17:19.747
such as this

17:19.914 --> 17:22.291
ask the right questions.

17:39.600 --> 17:44.522
I'm sure you will
resolve your differences.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.691
<i>Hm'?</i>

17:48.734 --> 17:53.656
Do you know why I spend
so much time playing this piano?

17:53.823 --> 17:57.118
My husband sold my instrument
in Langenburg

17:57.285 --> 17:59.287
to pay off his gambling debts.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.708
I hardly know anything
of your life in Germany.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.672
When I first arrived here, I...

18:09.839 --> 18:11.674
thought we would
never understand each other

18:11.841 --> 18:13.843
the way we did as children,

18:14.010 --> 18:16.387
my life had become so dark.

18:16.554 --> 18:20.391
And yours was...

18:20.558 --> 18:21.809
so light.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.147
But perhaps we have
more in common than I thought.

18:31.235 --> 18:35.072
I too understand the ache
of a lonely marriage.

18:41.162 --> 18:44.582
We've always fought,

18:44.749 --> 18:46.417
but in the past, it would...

18:46.584 --> 18:49.629
It would bring us closer together.

18:52.673 --> 18:56.218
He still resents me for
taking him away from Osborne,

18:56.385 --> 18:57.678
his...

18:57.845 --> 18:59.722
His creation.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.932
Ycu believe he is trying
to take revenge?

19:02.099 --> 19:04.018
That's a strong word.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.686
Hmm.

19:08.898 --> 19:13.402
II'

19:13.569 --> 19:15.112
Perhaps it's the right one.

19:18.699 --> 19:23.412
II'

19:30.628 --> 19:32.421
<i>No human pursuits</i>

19:32.588 --> 19:35.257
have ever made
any material progress

19:35.424 --> 19:39.261
until science was brought
to bear upon them.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.389
Now, we must not be complacent.

19:41.555 --> 19:45.184
We must consistently test
the limits of our knowledge.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.688
For, in the words
of Alexander von Humboldt,

19:48.854 --> 19:50.356
the renowned scientist,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.501
who I believe was in residence
at Magdalen College,

19:52.525 --> 19:54.735
universities ask questions

19:54.902 --> 20:00.241
where the answers are not known.

20:00.408 --> 20:05.037
School is discipline.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.916
University is freedom.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.962
Hear! Hear!

20:20.720 --> 20:23.180
Thank you for your thoughts
on our education,

20:23.347 --> 20:24.807
Your Royal Highness.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.517
Cambridge has produced

20:26.684 --> 20:28.102
the greatest minds in the world

20:28.269 --> 20:30.980
for over 600 years

20:31.147 --> 20:34.608
from a curriculum based
in theology

20:34.775 --> 20:37.194
and the lessons of the past.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.238
Are you, for example,

20:39.405 --> 20:42.867
suggesting that we teach the
heretical work of Charles Lyell,

20:43.033 --> 20:45.536
who believes that the world

20:45.703 --> 20:48.038
was not created in seven days?

20:48.205 --> 20:49.540
Hear! Hear!

21:00.092 --> 21:01.093
Foreigners.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.971
It is bought in by foreigners.

21:04.138 --> 21:05.514
The first case recorded

21:05.681 --> 21:07.161
was in a Seaman's hostel
in Limehouse.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.476
Nonsense.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.353
The toxic miasma

21:11.520 --> 21:12.605
should abate soon,

21:12.772 --> 21:14.416
and now that Covent Garden
has been closed.

21:14.440 --> 21:19.028
The only cure is for
people to maintain their composure.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.821
Are we safe here in the palace?

21:20.988 --> 21:24.200
Here, you are
quite protected, ma'am.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.119
The air is clean and safe
around the palace.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.704
But outside,

21:28.871 --> 21:31.665
the danger of encountering
the miasma

21:31.832 --> 21:33.417
is too great.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.224
Are you proposing to put me
in quarantine?

21:35.377 --> 21:37.755
As your prime
minister, I urge you

21:37.922 --> 21:41.842
to remain here until contagion
has passed, ma'am.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.636
And what example
does it set to my people

21:43.803 --> 21:45.429
if I'm hiding here
in the palace?

21:45.596 --> 21:47.556
You don't have to be seen,
ma'am.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.184
You could announce
a national day of penance,

21:50.351 --> 21:51.685
perhaps a day of fast.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.580
Would that would raise
the spirits of my people?

21:53.604 --> 21:54.772
No.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.028
Dr. Shaw?

22:01.195 --> 22:02.738
Do you have another theory

22:02.905 --> 22:05.199
about how the disease is spread?

22:05.366 --> 22:08.786
? I s»s...

22:11.664 --> 22:12.665
Yes?

22:16.377 --> 22:20.214
Without proof,
I cannot offer you an answer,

22:20.381 --> 22:24.260
and as I... have no proof,
I have no answer,

22:24.426 --> 22:28.222
Y-your Majesty.

22:28.389 --> 22:31.892
II'

22:32.059 --> 22:34.895
<i>Russell has been most unhelpful.</i>

22:35.062 --> 22:36.540
Have heard the reports
from Parliament

22:36.564 --> 22:38.482
and I do not wish to stand idle.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.379
I should like you to organize
a visit to the hospital.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.238
I'm your foreign secretary,
ma'am.

22:44.405 --> 22:45.531
May suggest you con-tacit

22:45.698 --> 22:47.175
the commissioner
for the Board of Health.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.202
And he will hem and haw

22:50.369 --> 22:51.912
and talk about
the danger of infection.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.331
You, on the other hand,

22:54.498 --> 22:56.625
you've never met a rule
you didn't want to break.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.838
You sound like my wife, ma'am.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.485
But don't you worry
about catching it?

23:05.092 --> 23:07.511
Lord Palmerston,
if one of my children were ill,

23:07.678 --> 23:10.014
I would not hesitate
to go into the sickroom.

23:12.141 --> 23:16.395
I understand... I'll make
the necessary arrangements.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.105
Although I imagine
those woolgatherers

23:18.272 --> 23:19.398
at the Board of Health

23:19.565 --> 23:20.649
will have a Conniption fit.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.901
Not if we don't tell them.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.657
Your Grace.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.162
From the duke.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.423
Can you, uh, order my carriage?

23:44.590 --> 23:46.926
I have been summoned.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.344
I hope you will be careful.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.304
Surely your husband

23:50.471 --> 23:52.348
would rather you remained
in the palace

23:52.514 --> 23:54.433
until the contagion has passed.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.185
I cannot refuse him.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.312
In this circumstance,
you should not be afraid to.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.988
Shall I let him know that
you are to remain at the palace?

24:08.155 --> 24:10.491
If he's not at home,
he will be at his club.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.078
Exactly.

24:18.540 --> 24:23.963
II'

24:36.308 --> 24:40.521
II'

24:40.688 --> 24:42.106
I make two kinds of tonic

24:42.272 --> 24:43.392
for women in your condition.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.235
This one

24:46.402 --> 24:49.446
works a treat
for ladies who are happy

24:49.613 --> 24:50.773
to welcome a little stranger.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.909
And, um, I have this one...

24:55.494 --> 24:56.996
for those who aren't.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.466
II'

25:18.350 --> 25:20.978
Do you want a surprise?

25:21.145 --> 25:23.022
Depends.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.273
Is it a good one?

25:24.440 --> 25:25.733
Yes.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.194
But you'll have to be patient.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.947
Why?

25:32.114 --> 25:34.992
Because you'll have to wait
nine months.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.630
Yes? Yes.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.034
You also want
some entertainment.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.142
What we've been craving.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.062
Your Grace,
have a message for you.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.606
I'm sorry,
I didn't quite catch that.

26:05.773 --> 26:07.608
A message, Your Grace.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.027
It's almost as though he's
speaking a different language.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.099
Her Grace would like
to inform you

26:13.238 --> 26:16.575
that she has decided
to remain at the palace.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.210
You can remind the duchess

26:26.376 --> 26:30.547
that as it was a command,
I did not expect a reply.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.299
She must leave immediately.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.057
II'

26:40.224 --> 26:42.267
Are you sure
you want to do this, ma'am?

26:42.434 --> 26:45.270
It's not a matter of want.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.939
It's a matter of duty.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.357
Excuse me, miss.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.416
Help me, sir.

27:07.501 --> 27:10.587
II'

27:20.347 --> 27:25.144
II'

27:27.104 --> 27:28.689
Just straight ahead, ma'am.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.191
This way.

27:31.358 --> 27:35.696
II'

27:35.863 --> 27:38.282
It's a cruel disease, ma'am.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.035
What's that noise?

27:46.748 --> 27:49.626
I found her on the floor
of the Parthenon in Athens.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.753
She had fallen from her nest.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.173
And I've had her with me
ever since.

27:56.383 --> 27:57.610
Aren't you worried
she'll bite you?

27:57.634 --> 27:59.553
No, she never has yet.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.598
Just as I've never caught
anything from my patients.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.517
So you don't believe
in the miasma theory?

28:05.684 --> 28:07.724
If it was in the air,
I would be dead by now, ma'am.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.397
What do you think causes it?

28:12.191 --> 28:14.818
All I know is that it is
a disease that follows poverty,

28:14.985 --> 28:16.069
and dirt.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.364
There must be...

28:19.531 --> 28:23.869
God, there must be
something I can do.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.329
A subscription.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.747
Blankets.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.836
The medical board have theories.

28:33.003 --> 28:34.504
Fairy tales.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.341
There's only one doctor
who comes to visit.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.260
A quiet man with a stammer.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.707
I hope he will put an end to it.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.181
Thank you.

28:46.141 --> 28:50.520
II'

28:50.687 --> 28:52.105
What is your name?

28:52.272 --> 28:54.900
Florence Nightingale, ma'am.

28:55.067 --> 28:58.070
The work of Lyell
is most intriguing.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.614
If the fossils do indeed
date from different periods,

29:00.781 --> 29:01.865
then there is no basis...

29:02.032 --> 29:04.368
Sir, I...
I thought you should know,

29:04.534 --> 29:06.411
the gentleman, Powis,
who made his...

29:06.578 --> 29:09.206
preferences so clear at dinner

29:09.373 --> 29:11.750
has decided to stand
against you.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.922
Has this ever happened before?

29:17.089 --> 29:19.341
No, but then they have never
been faced with the prospect

29:19.508 --> 29:22.135
of a foreign chancellor,
and a German one at that.

29:24.888 --> 29:30.185
II'

29:42.781 --> 29:44.491
Thank you.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.410
II'

29:46.576 --> 29:48.662
Mama! Mama!

29:48.829 --> 29:50.831
Mama!

29:50.998 --> 29:52.291
Darling!

29:52.457 --> 29:54.017
Oh, come here, come here.
We missed you.

29:56.545 --> 29:57.545
What is it, Mama?

29:57.629 --> 29:58.629
Is it my fault?

30:01.883 --> 30:03.468
No, darling, I'm...

30:06.179 --> 30:08.140
I'm just <i>so</i> happy to see you.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.393
Aren't you happy to see me?

30:18.608 --> 30:19.860
Come along.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.111
Back inside.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.574
Oh, Victoria.

30:25.741 --> 30:29.077
My poor sister.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.084
There was nothing could do.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.712
You're so hard on yourself, hm?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.805
Duchess, it's your turn.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.935
Your Grace.

30:54.102 --> 30:57.731
The duke has asked me
to inform you

30:57.898 --> 31:00.609
he does not wholly agree
with your message.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.365
I see.

31:08.075 --> 31:12.788
I could let him know
that it is a royal command.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.794
Thank you, I will deal
with the situation myself.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.386
I wish to see him.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.096
The young gentleman,
Yorkshireman.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.724
Dr. Snow?

31:32.891 --> 31:35.268
The fellow who could hardly

31:35.435 --> 31:37.187
string a sentence together?

31:37.354 --> 31:39.564
You should know that he is seen

31:39.731 --> 31:41.149
by the medical establishment

31:41.316 --> 31:42.442
as an eccentric.

31:44.111 --> 31:46.822
I hear he doesn't eat meat.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.949
Or fish.

31:49.116 --> 31:52.411
If he can discover
the cause of this disease,

31:52.577 --> 31:57.040
then his diet
is 0f no concern to me.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.543
Please send for him immediately.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.468
J " Home, sweet home J".

32:15.767 --> 32:17.936
How long you been there
watching me?

32:18.103 --> 32:19.896
Long enough. For what?

32:20.063 --> 32:22.607
For you to finish so won't
have to {do any work.

32:24.526 --> 32:25.944
That's why I married you.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.406
Oh!

32:29.573 --> 32:31.366
Oh, it's perfect.

32:39.833 --> 32:40.917
Am I late?

32:41.084 --> 32:42.210
The guest of honor is...

32:42.377 --> 32:44.045
never late, Mr. Brodie.
Never late!

32:45.464 --> 32:46.715
Take this off. Thank you.

32:46.882 --> 32:47.716
Oh, hello.

32:47.883 --> 32:48.967
Welcome.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.471
Abigail!

32:52.637 --> 32:54.264
Both hungry?

32:54.431 --> 32:55.807
There is a lot to get through

32:55.974 --> 32:57.454
before we open to the public
tomorrow.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.394
How's life at the palace,
Mr. Brodie?

32:59.561 --> 33:01.771
Well, the queen isn't very happy

33:01.938 --> 33:03.190
with her new dresser,

33:03.356 --> 33:04.941
and she's been doing
her own hair.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.588
You're not hitting
the bottle, are you?

33:16.620 --> 33:17.746
Joseph?

33:20.290 --> 33:21.374
I, uh...

33:23.376 --> 33:25.378
I, I need some sealing wax.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.173
Your Grace.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.091
Lam glad you are still
at the palace.

33:30.258 --> 33:34.221
The queen is the only woman
he can't pull rank on.

33:34.387 --> 33:37.307
II'

33:37.474 --> 33:39.309
You weren't at dinner.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.520
It was very quiet.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.523
Is my voice so loud?

33:46.900 --> 33:51.071
When it's the
only thing I can hear.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.031
II'

34:05.043 --> 34:09.714
I can hardly believe I'm here,
under my own roof,

34:09.881 --> 34:12.008
with my beautiful wife

34:12.175 --> 34:15.387
and... with...
a little Francatelli on the way?

34:19.432 --> 34:20.433
Long live the house

34:20.600 --> 34:21.600
of Francatelli!

34:22.811 --> 34:24.104
Thank you.

34:24.271 --> 34:25.438
I want to propose a toast.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.191
To Charles Francatelli,

34:28.358 --> 34:30.235
for not listening to me
when 1 said

34:30.402 --> 34:31.611
this couldn't be done.

34:31.778 --> 34:34.864
We may have left the palace,

34:35.031 --> 34:37.200
but he is a king among men.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.413
- Good health.
- To good health.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.127
If you'll excuse me
for just a moment.

34:47.294 --> 34:49.504
Oh, that is delicious.
Lovely speech.

34:49.671 --> 34:51.172
Thank you.

35:05.604 --> 35:10.483
II'

35:21.995 --> 35:23.872
<i>"MAN". Powis for chancellor!</i>

35:28.376 --> 35:29.502
Powis for chancellor!

35:30.837 --> 35:31.963
Down with the German!

35:38.386 --> 35:40.138
Lord Palmerston.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.974
I did not know
you were in Cambridge.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.435
I thought I'd make the trip
to brush up on my Ovid.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.815
And as a graduate,
I've come to vote, of course.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.610
The future of this university
is very important to me.

35:55.945 --> 35:58.782
And to the nation.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.252
What do you want?

36:11.419 --> 36:14.547
You are still
open, despite the cholera.

36:14.714 --> 36:15.799
What's it to you?

36:15.965 --> 36:18.259
I have patients in this street.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.636
Nothing wrong with my men.

36:19.803 --> 36:22.055
How curious.

36:22.222 --> 36:25.016
It's simple:
No women, no foreigners,

36:25.183 --> 36:26.518
and all the beer you can drink.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.187
Here, go on,
have one on the house.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.648
No, thank you.

36:31.815 --> 36:32.816
Suit yourself.

36:32.982 --> 36:34.317
I reckon it's the best medicine

36:34.484 --> 36:36.486
out there. Cheers!

36:36.653 --> 36:42.450
II'

36:44.953 --> 36:46.830
- He refused my invitation?
- As I said,

36:46.996 --> 36:49.749
Dr. Snow is seen as a maverick.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.459
But what was his reason?

36:51.626 --> 36:55.588
Apparently he hasn't found
the proof you needed, ma'am.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.755
Proof or no proof,
I should like to speak with him.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.428
Send for him again.

37:01.594 --> 37:06.474
II'

37:13.857 --> 37:17.777
II'

37:26.995 --> 37:28.538
I went to church.

37:28.705 --> 37:29.873
And then?

37:32.876 --> 37:33.960
To my apothecary shop.

37:34.127 --> 37:35.879
Where is that?

37:36.045 --> 37:37.756
Soho.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.467
Just off Broad Street.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.431
And-and after work?

37:50.059 --> 37:51.186
Mrs. Arbuthnot.

37:52.896 --> 37:54.230
Need a few more answers.

37:54.397 --> 37:57.025
You're the only case
outside Soho.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.276
I visited my sister.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.069
Is she sick?

38:02.989 --> 38:04.115
No.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.995
What route did you take home?

38:09.162 --> 38:10.413
The usual.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.544
Marshall Street. Broad Street.

38:18.087 --> 38:20.548
You can stop off
for fresh water at the pump.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.720
For my tonics.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.847
II'

38:33.895 --> 38:37.941
Here you are, my darling,
everything just as you like it.

38:38.107 --> 38:41.069
Coddled eggs,
poor knights of Windsor,

38:41.236 --> 38:43.279
and then more...
What shall we call the baby?

38:43.446 --> 38:45.031
Plenty of time to decide that.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.743
Victoria if it's a boy.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.578
Albert if it's a girl.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.459
No, that's not right.

38:56.626 --> 38:59.504
Victoria... if it's a girl.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.755
Shh... Nancy.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.006
Nancy.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.555
What are you doing?

39:08.721 --> 39:11.766
We have to get up
or Mr. Penge will find us.

39:11.933 --> 39:14.853
Shh, shh, Nancy, Nancy.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.437
We're not in the palace anymore.

39:16.604 --> 39:23.653
II'

39:36.749 --> 39:41.629
II'

39:53.099 --> 39:57.979
II'

40:02.025 --> 40:03.401
Stop using that pump!

40:03.568 --> 40:05.737
Stop! Please!

40:05.904 --> 40:07.614
What are you doing?

40:11.075 --> 40:13.161
II'

40:13.328 --> 40:15.997
Go on, get out of here!

40:16.164 --> 40:21.669
II'

40:25.465 --> 40:27.842
The votes have been counted.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.306
Votes for the earl of Powis...

40:33.473 --> 40:34.933
837.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.937
Votes for.

40:39.103 --> 40:42.357
His Royal Highness
Prince Albert»

40:42.523 --> 40:43.858
953.

40:51.115 --> 40:54.410
Congratulations,
Your Royal Highness.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.037
Thank you.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.122
Although I'm sure
you will be pleased to hear

40:58.289 --> 41:00.708
that I shall not be accepting
the chancellorship

41:00.875 --> 41:03.962
under such circumstances.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.380
Clearly they do not want me.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.215
Well then, my journey

41:07.382 --> 41:09.175
will have been in vain.

41:09.342 --> 41:10.843
You voted for me?

41:11.010 --> 41:12.470
Yes, I surprised even myself.

41:12.637 --> 41:16.265
I had what the dons might call
a Damascene conversion.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.226
You have come around
to my way of thinking?

41:18.393 --> 41:20.645
Only on the matter
of cholera, sir.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.903
Congratulations, sir.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.993
I...

41:35.159 --> 41:37.453
wondered what...

41:37.620 --> 41:38.913
We don't have all day.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.456
Prime Minister,

41:40.623 --> 41:43.751
perhaps you could leave
Dr. Snow and I to talk alone.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.601
PRESS.

42:00.768 --> 42:03.563
Make yourself comfortable.

42:04.814 --> 42:05.940
Tea?

42:15.575 --> 42:16.951
I th...

42:19.912 --> 42:21.247
I thought that the, uh...

42:21.414 --> 42:22.832
Please, let me.

42:26.335 --> 42:27.378
That Will be all.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.303
Speaking in public
has always been of...

42:35.470 --> 42:37.013
great difficulty to me.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.934
The trick, I find, is...

42:42.101 --> 42:46.314
is to pretend
I'm speaking to lslay.

42:46.481 --> 42:49.067
[slay hangs? On my every (word.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.651
Don't you, lslay?

42:58.618 --> 43:00.495
You were saying?

43:02.663 --> 43:05.208
I've been c-certain for a while.

43:05.374 --> 43:09.629
It's not miasma,
not the air, but the water.

43:09.796 --> 43:11.964
Bad water, ma'am.

43:12.131 --> 43:14.926
Women and children are
more likely to drink water

43:15.093 --> 43:17.428
and they have died
in greater numbers.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.056
Men who work in the breweries
are unaffected

43:20.223 --> 43:22.433
because they only drink beer.

43:22.600 --> 43:28.189
But... then this...
case in Hampstead.

43:28.356 --> 43:32.819
Only one woman in the village
had contracted it.

43:32.985 --> 43:36.447
I discovered that she had
her water brought up

43:36.614 --> 43:39.117
from a pump in Broad Street.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.035
She even used it in the tonics

43:41.202 --> 43:42.995
in her apothecary.

43:43.162 --> 43:46.582
It is the pump
that is spreading the disease.

43:46.749 --> 43:50.545
This evidence, I believe,
can finally stop the contagion.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.466
Excuse me.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.720
Sir, what was the name
of the woman

43:59.887 --> 44:00.972
making the tonics?

44:01.139 --> 44:02.390
Arbuthnot.

44:06.769 --> 44:10.565
II'

44:13.776 --> 44:18.656
II'

44:24.579 --> 44:29.458
II'

44:37.800 --> 44:39.051
Your Royal Highness.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.596
They are ready for you.

45:07.914 --> 45:09.332
No.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.671
Do something.

45:15.838 --> 45:18.341
Do... something!

45:18.507 --> 45:19.634
When did it start?

45:20.801 --> 45:22.595
Early this morning.

45:22.762 --> 45:24.642
I thought it was something
to do with the child.

45:26.599 --> 45:28.476
Child?

45:33.606 --> 45:36.108
II'

45:48.120 --> 45:50.623
Oh, dear Skerrett.

45:50.790 --> 45:56.212
II'

45:56.379 --> 45:58.506
Do you want me to do your hair,
ma'am?

46:06.222 --> 46:08.683
I've got my own palace now.

46:10.476 --> 46:13.479
Yes, you have.

46:15.481 --> 46:17.984
It's splendid.

46:20.027 --> 46:23.614
Victoria...

46:23.781 --> 46:25.741
if it's a girl.

46:28.577 --> 46:32.415
I couldn't dream
of a greater honor.

46:36.627 --> 46:37.878
Charles!

46:38.045 --> 46:39.714
II'

46:47.263 --> 46:52.143
II'

47:02.945 --> 47:07.908
II'

47:19.378 --> 47:22.757
II'

47:27.678 --> 47:32.558
II'

47:39.565 --> 47:43.277
The chancellor
of Cambridge University.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.323
Congratulations, Albert.

47:48.824 --> 47:51.827
It should have been a,
a formality,

47:51.994 --> 47:54.372
but instead it was a...

47:54.538 --> 47:58.125
a humiliation.

47:58.292 --> 48:01.128
But you won.

48:01.295 --> 48:03.547
Just.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.591
I should have listened
to Victoria.

48:06.801 --> 48:08.094
It is not enough to be right,

48:08.260 --> 48:11.889
one also has to win over
the public.

48:13.641 --> 48:18.521
II'

48:34.453 --> 48:37.581
Do you remember

48:37.748 --> 48:40.167
when I first told you my name?

48:43.254 --> 48:44.713
That was when knew.

48:47.133 --> 48:48.592
So did I.

48:52.513 --> 48:55.224
All that time,

48:55.391 --> 48:57.226
we could have been together.

49:00.062 --> 49:02.189
Just you wait.

49:06.318 --> 49:08.195
All of this...

49:11.740 --> 49:13.701
will be a marvelous success.

49:17.037 --> 49:19.748
Not without you.

49:22.585 --> 49:25.004
I should have married you soonen.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.885
It wasn't long...

49:35.681 --> 49:38.058
But it meant everything.

49:42.646 --> 49:50.237
II'

50:04.043 --> 50:06.003
Nancy?

50:10.216 --> 50:11.800
Nan... Nancy.

50:28.901 --> 50:35.658
I All for to hear
the small birds sing <i>I.</i>

51:00.099 --> 51:02.977
<i>I know that I left
when you needed me most.</i>

51:03.143 --> 51:07.147

51:16.031 --> 51:17.908
I...

51:19.743 --> 51:21.954
I never opened her letter.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.883
You could not have known.

51:37.136 --> 51:41.599
<i>But as much as I
wanted to remain by your side...</i>

51:41.765 --> 51:45.477
