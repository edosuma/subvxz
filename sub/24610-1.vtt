Okay, there. Sorry.

Shut up, bird.

00:54.581 --> 00:55.715
Why are you in here, dummy?

00:55.716 --> 00:57.783
What...?
Because the frickin' fuel pump's

00:57.785 --> 01:00.085
still hinky and we got that charter.

01:00.087 --> 01:02.220
- That's tomorrow.
- It is tomorrow.

01:02.222 --> 01:04.355
- I just said that.
- No, you...

01:04.358 --> 01:07.794
- You've been drunk two days!
- Oh, right.

01:07.795 --> 01:10.962

you're here, naked lady stranger.

- I remember drinking champagne

to play roulette in the back room...

He just ditched you?

- It was actually in a drawer.

04:57.224 --> 05:01.864
My point is, as the majority
stakeholder in Archer Airways,

05:01.899 --> 05:04.463
I'd like to see
a return on my investment.

05:04.465 --> 05:06.398
Ah, well, yeah, we all would.

- And we got a charter.

- A what?
- [Stratton] A boat, you fool.

05:10.437 --> 05:14.706
- I want a boat.
- Why, Mr. Stratton, you're down early.

- Porridge.

05:17.478 --> 05:21.280

- Save your breath for cooling yours.

- But I don't understand. Are you...?
- And you!

05:27.955 --> 05:30.422
I have half a mind to give you
the worst beating of your life.

05:30.424 --> 05:33.125
All right, now.
You're obviously upset.

05:33.127 --> 05:35.027
Yeah, you're talking crazy.

Well, then maybe I'll just sue him

and prosecute you for...

05:44.138 --> 05:45.471

05:45.472 --> 05:47.639
Yeah, I don't think

- Manu, call the tender.
- Yes, Mama.

05:58.052 --> 05:59.985

- Why does it bother you so much?
- [stifled chuckle] Seriously?!

06:03.390 --> 06:04.924
Now, while you're waiting,

06:04.925 --> 06:06.959

settle your account?

06:06.961 --> 06:09.061

06:09.063 --> 06:11.597

06:34.521 --> 06:36.855
- that gambling is going on in here!

He is parrot.

- Shut up, bird.

form of eyehole cancer,

- What do you mean?!
- I mean just that, it is impossible.

09:54.612 --> 09:57.179
To get a passport, you
have to go to the consulate

09:57.181 --> 09:58.681
in Papeete, on Tahiti.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.183
- Well, how far is that?
- As the crow flies?

10:01.185 --> 10:02.519
Ugh, crows.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.920
On the supply ship,
it takes about a week.

10:04.922 --> 10:07.189
- A week?!
- It makes other stops.

10:07.191 --> 10:11.261
And it will be here in...
one month.

10:11.262 --> 10:14.088
[sobbing]
[glass breaks]

10:19.769 --> 10:22.738
Of course, it's only
three hours by plane.

10:22.740 --> 10:26.074
Well, news flash, lady,
the plane just left!

10:26.076 --> 10:28.577
Yeah, so, air travel's not
really an option here, Mother.

10:28.579 --> 10:31.313
[gasps]
Well, now, wait a minute...

10:31.315 --> 10:33.215
- Mother...
- Sterling, dear,

10:33.217 --> 10:35.919
couldn't you just take
her in your plane? [groans]

10:35.920 --> 10:38.053
- Your what?
- Hey, yeah!

10:38.055 --> 10:41.691
- No, actually, Mother, I can't.
- Well, why ever not?

10:41.692 --> 10:46.763
- Because! Uh, because...
- [Princess Lanaluakalani] Presumably...

10:46.764 --> 10:50.232
because you can't tell time.

10:50.234 --> 10:53.702
Her royal highness,
Princess Lanaluakalani.

10:53.704 --> 10:57.073
<i>- Latou te iloa.
- Votre Altesse.</i>

10:57.074 --> 11:01.543
<i>Ah, Capitaine Reynaud.
Et pourquoi me parles-tu en français?</i>

11:01.545 --> 11:05.547
<i>Parce que la langue officielle
de Mitimotu est français.</i>

11:05.549 --> 11:08.083
<i>Oui, en ce moment.</i>

11:08.085 --> 11:12.088
Now, can someone please explain
to me why Mr. Fuchs and I

11:12.089 --> 11:15.490
aren't sipping champagne
in the plane I chartered?

11:15.492 --> 11:18.026
- Uh, well...
- For one thing, we don't do that.

11:18.028 --> 11:20.762
- And secondly, Fuchs?
- Yeah?

11:20.764 --> 11:22.698
Well, we could, and we're
happy to, Your Highness.

11:22.700 --> 11:27.302
Or even... I bet we could
even mix you up some Bellinis.

11:27.304 --> 11:29.004
- We have fresh peaches?
- No.

11:29.006 --> 11:31.306
Then shut up!
The point is, Your Highness,

11:31.308 --> 11:34.010
- my plane is your plane.
- Well, then...

11:34.011 --> 11:37.680
What?! I don't care who you are,
lady, I've got dibs on that plane.

11:37.681 --> 11:39.282
[clears throat]

11:39.283 --> 11:40.983
Reynaud?

11:41.551 --> 11:42.852
[Reynaud] I'm very sorry, madame,

11:42.853 --> 11:47.523
but we have strict law against
vagrancy, and you have no money.

11:47.524 --> 11:48.858
[grunts in frustration]

11:48.859 --> 11:52.328
<i>Alors, for your dinner,
one turnip.</i>

11:52.329 --> 11:55.095
<i>[Lanaluakalani] You must be kidding.</i>

11:55.565 --> 11:57.265
[Engine sputters]

11:57.266 --> 11:59.101
[Lanaluakalani] Are you
sure this thing can fly?

11:59.103 --> 12:01.370
Oh, don't worry about ol' Lucy Goosey.

12:01.372 --> 12:05.440
She may not look like much,
but that's... [engine backfires]

12:05.442 --> 12:08.411
- ...mainly cosmetic. Flaps!
- Well, except for the fue...

12:08.412 --> 12:10.412
- I just...
- Flaps, goddamn it, flaps!

12:10.414 --> 12:12.447
Okay, Your Highness, as you requested,

12:12.449 --> 12:14.783
we'll be making a big
loop around the island,

12:14.785 --> 12:17.637
so just sit back and relax.

12:18.554 --> 12:20.689
That is physically impossible.

12:20.691 --> 12:23.458
<i>Uh. Ja, zis is
not a good airplane.</i>

12:23.460 --> 12:25.994
I hope it at least has parachutes.

12:25.996 --> 12:29.198
- There's actually only three, so...
<i>- [yelps] Gott im Himmel!</i>

12:29.199 --> 12:32.441
Oh, yes, I talk. Get over it.

12:41.378 --> 12:43.311
[jazz music playing over record player]

12:49.919 --> 12:51.920
[Archer] No, Your Highness, I just meant

12:51.922 --> 12:56.391
- it's kinda weird though, right?
- I think he's just reacting to the music.

12:56.393 --> 12:59.996
- Thanks, you just defined dancing.
- Shut up, bird!

12:59.997 --> 13:02.632
No, I mean, it's not a big
island, so the fact that

13:02.633 --> 13:05.267
we've never run into each
other, kinda weird, right?

13:05.269 --> 13:08.938
No.
And should you... be drinking?

13:08.939 --> 13:10.473
[gulping]

13:10.474 --> 13:11.874
- Yes.
- I...

13:11.875 --> 13:15.043
So what's your story, Fuchs?
What brings you out here to Mitimotu?

13:15.045 --> 13:17.879
- Er, uh, well, er...
- Breadfruit.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.449
Oh, ja! I will make a plantation.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.852
- A plantation? Where?
- Down there. On the island.

13:23.854 --> 13:25.620
Creating many jobs for our people.

13:25.622 --> 13:28.690
[chuckling] As what,
artisanal coffin builders?

13:28.692 --> 13:30.293
<i>- Was?
- Nothing.</i>

13:30.294 --> 13:31.360
Nothing but danger.

13:31.361 --> 13:34.229
That jungle's stuffed
to the tits with quicksand,

13:34.231 --> 13:36.865
ferocious baboons, poisonous snakes...

13:36.867 --> 13:40.235
- Poisonous frogs.
- The frogs are poisonous?

13:40.237 --> 13:42.603
- Mildly.
- Insanely. I mean,

13:42.638 --> 13:44.940
you get hit by a dart
slathered with frog poison...?

13:44.942 --> 13:46.609
- Will you...?
- A dart? From where?

13:46.610 --> 13:48.044
- The cannibals.
- Please!

13:48.045 --> 13:49.612
- What cannibals?!
- The...

13:49.613 --> 13:53.582
- The Mua Mua! Man, they are...
- Simply a small native tribe

13:53.584 --> 13:55.251
that has had very limited experience

13:55.252 --> 13:57.923
with people from the outside world.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.457
- Except as food.
- If you...

14:01.458 --> 14:04.360
- Although compared to the dragons...
- What dragons?!

14:04.361 --> 14:06.128
Oh. They're just extremely big lizards.

14:06.130 --> 14:10.031
- You told me none of these dangers!
- Because the dangers...

14:10.033 --> 14:13.168
aren't that dangerous.
And if Mister...

14:13.170 --> 14:14.837
- [Pam] Archer!
- Thank you. If Mister...

14:14.838 --> 14:17.038
[Pam] No, Archer, come here!
Like now!

14:17.040 --> 14:19.508
- What's happening?
- Is there a problem?

14:19.510 --> 14:21.983
[chuckles] No.

14:23.045 --> 14:25.982
- What is your problem?
- It's not my problem, it's Lucy's!

14:25.983 --> 14:29.252
- Her fuel pressure's dropping!
- Son of a... [music]

14:29.253 --> 14:30.820
Why do you always do this?

14:30.821 --> 14:32.587
I mean, I finally meet
someone I might like,

14:32.589 --> 14:34.856
we're having fun,
getting to know each other,

14:34.858 --> 14:37.893
I'm being super charming, but no,

14:37.895 --> 14:42.080
I'm not allowed to be happy
because you're a big, jealous baby!

14:42.865 --> 14:44.599
Oh. You're talking to me?

14:44.601 --> 14:46.935
- Who else is there?!
- The fuel pump.

14:46.937 --> 14:49.286
Oh, right.
Okay, I've got a plan.

14:49.523 --> 14:52.040
[engines sputtering]

14:52.041 --> 14:53.775
[Pam] I'm all ears.

14:53.777 --> 14:55.311
<i>- What is wrong?
- Was ist los?!</i>

14:55.312 --> 14:57.245
[Archer] Nothing, all good.
Have some bubbles.

14:57.247 --> 14:58.548
Feather props!

14:58.549 --> 15:00.082
Feather one!
Feather two!

15:00.083 --> 15:01.250
<i>[Fuchs] Nein! Let me go!</i>

15:01.251 --> 15:02.585
Okay, now let me see if we...

15:02.586 --> 15:05.387
- We are going to die up here!
- No, we're not!

15:05.389 --> 15:07.389
Yeah, it's the ground that kills ya.

15:07.391 --> 15:08.858
- Thanks.
- Eh.

15:08.859 --> 15:12.595
- But how can we fly with no engines?!
- The same way a bird does...

15:12.596 --> 15:15.364
- Flapping around with hollow bones?
- [Archer] Shut up, bird!

15:15.365 --> 15:17.934
We're gonna glide
right into a smooth landing.

15:17.935 --> 15:20.202
Where?!
The island has no runway!

15:20.204 --> 15:23.873
- The ocean is the runway.
- But... [startled yelp]

15:23.874 --> 15:26.041
[Archer] Wh...?
No, no, no, no, no, no!

15:26.043 --> 15:29.412
- [Pam] Well, it was.
- Goddamn it, Fuchs!

15:29.413 --> 15:33.048
Ach! Why would someone put
the landing gear control there?!

15:33.050 --> 15:34.783
Because they didn't
know you're an asshole?

15:34.785 --> 15:36.585
- Get 'em up!
- Love to...

15:36.587 --> 15:38.920
- But...
- Goddamn it!

15:38.922 --> 15:41.289
- What?!
- We can't land on the water

15:41.291 --> 15:45.527
- if the frickin' wheels are down!
- And if there is no runway...

15:45.529 --> 15:47.495
Oof! What are you doing?

15:47.497 --> 15:49.531
[Fuchs] Parachutes!
[Crackers squawks]

15:49.533 --> 15:51.666
[Fuchs] Where are the parachutes?!

15:51.668 --> 15:54.136
- Oh, for the... You pussy!
- No, he's right!

15:54.137 --> 15:55.671
- What?
- [Fuchs] Ah-ha!

15:55.672 --> 15:58.139
<i>- You all gotta bail out!
- Oka atua!</i>

15:58.141 --> 16:01.343
Go on! I'll get us over land,
you get the princess in a chute,

16:01.345 --> 16:03.411
get her down safe,
and get her home safe!

16:03.413 --> 16:05.614
- What about you?!
- I'll try to bring Lucy down

16:05.616 --> 16:08.250
easy in the water.
Go on, I'll be fine!

16:08.252 --> 16:12.407
- No you won't!
- Just go, you big dumb ox!

16:12.588 --> 16:17.859
Wow.
Okay, let's go, Your Fanciness.

16:17.861 --> 16:21.063
<i>[nervous, to self] Vater Unser im
Himmel, geheiligt werde dein Name...</i>

16:21.064 --> 16:22.665
Better pray I don't kick your ass...

16:22.666 --> 16:25.000
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Well, the first thing

16:25.002 --> 16:26.702
you want to do, is
take some deep breaths.

16:26.703 --> 16:28.436
While you help her put that on!

16:28.438 --> 16:31.806
You help her!
I'm getting... owwww!

16:31.808 --> 16:35.444
<i>Your fists are like...
Dosenschinken!</i>

16:35.445 --> 16:37.013
[chuckles]
Yeah, I get that a lot.

16:37.014 --> 16:38.681
Hey! We don't have all day here!

16:38.682 --> 16:40.482
Once we get below a thousand feet,

16:40.484 --> 16:42.717
those chutes are
basically just laundry!

16:42.719 --> 16:45.020
[Pam] Hang on, we're almost ready!

16:45.022 --> 16:48.090
- Will you hurry up?!
- Will you shut up?!

16:48.091 --> 16:49.791
- There! Happy?
- Not really!

16:49.793 --> 16:54.129
Okay, you two! Jesus!
You can bitch on the way down.

16:54.131 --> 16:57.133
- What is all that for?!
- Protection. [cocks gun]

16:57.134 --> 16:58.534
We weren't kidding about that jungle.

16:58.535 --> 17:00.235
[Archer] Come on, Pam,
it's now or never!

17:00.237 --> 17:03.071
Let's go, people!
Move! Move! Move!

17:07.143 --> 17:11.012

17:13.517 --> 17:16.184
[Pam] Ow, my twat!

17:16.185 --> 17:19.355
[relieved exhale] Good luck.
Except for you, Fuchs.

17:19.356 --> 17:21.189
I hope you wind up as an entree.

17:21.191 --> 17:24.492
Hey, Crackers?
Crackers, come here, buddy!

17:24.493 --> 17:27.494
- Okay, so listen...
- Yeah, not great, huh?

17:27.497 --> 17:30.498
No, no, not great.
I'm gonna do the best I can,

17:30.500 --> 17:31.984
but we're gonna hit the water

17:31.985 --> 17:34.378
- pretty hard, probably even flip over.
- Mm-hmm.

17:34.413 --> 17:36.538
But there's a bunch of
life jackets in the storage locker,

17:36.540 --> 17:40.108
so I want you to get in there
and hunker down, okay, buddy?

17:40.110 --> 17:42.477
Hopefully that'll cushion the impact.

17:44.380 --> 17:46.581
Oh. You're talking to me.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.150
Wh...? Who else would I be...?

17:48.151 --> 17:50.018
- Oh.
- Yeah.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.920
- You can fly.
- Yeah.

17:51.922 --> 17:54.022
So you're outta here.

17:54.024 --> 17:55.990
- Is that weird?
- I mean...

17:55.992 --> 17:58.293
Well, yeah, obviously it's
weird if you make it weird.

17:58.295 --> 17:59.695
Okay, you know what?!
