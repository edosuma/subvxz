00:04.964 --> 00:07.776
If you didn't have much luck with that
antifascist.

00:09.211 --> 00:13.491
Does it suit me? -Shorten it a bit,
and it will be fine.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074

00:42.960 --> 00:47.398
Don't shorten it too much! The boy might
still grow a bit.

01:11.745 --> 01:14.873
He killed himself. -He really scared me!
I thought he was shooting at me.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.739
Leave!

01:42.000 --> 01:47.160
This is their last chance.
Their only resort left.

01:48.273 --> 01:52.834
Because Tito didn't have any luck in Konjic,
he's heading towards the Jablanica bridge.

01:53.434 --> 01:55.613
The photos are clearly indicating it.

01:56.015 --> 01:59.426
We are at the last stage of the
operation.

02:01.018 --> 02:04.226
We must destroy the partisans
in Jablanica.

02:05.385 --> 02:08.750
We push them towards Neretva

02:09.554 --> 02:12.964
and we don't let a single soul
cross the bridge.

02:14.993 --> 02:18.483
All Chetnik units should immediately
head here

02:19.440 --> 02:22.251
in the direction of Neretva.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.562
Mr. general.
Your plan is strategically...

02:31.709 --> 02:33.448
.... brilliant.

02:34.447 --> 02:39.485
But I dare think a bit different.

02:42.270 --> 02:45.634
Believe me, I don't want to interfere

02:46.241 --> 02:48.610
in military matters,
but I know this country well.

02:49.139 --> 02:51.757
I know the enemy.

02:53.109 --> 02:56.158
Go ahead,
I want to hear your opinion.

02:56.444 --> 02:59.381
It seems, the typhus is
doing its job.

03:01.646 --> 03:03.508
They're starving.

03:03.829 --> 03:06.561
Physically and mentally
they wont be able to endure,

03:07.243 --> 03:10.766
and here is our chance.
Let the partisans cross the bridge.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.852
Yes, they must cross the
bridge.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.509
They will drag the wounded on snow.

03:18.678 --> 03:21.930
There won't be much left from their
famous morale.

03:22.807 --> 03:25.857
They will start to accuse each other
and hate each other.

03:26.697 --> 03:29.070
They will curse the day,
when they decided

03:29.357 --> 03:32.847
to carry the wounded and typhus people
across these mountains.

03:34.004 --> 03:36.104
Let them eat each other.

03:37.776 --> 03:41.424
I like your idea very much,
but we don't have much time.

03:43.373 --> 03:46.704
Fuehrer's headquarters demands
immediate action.

03:48.019 --> 03:51.113
That's why we will attack immediately .
We musn't give them time.

03:51.235 --> 03:53.290
Not even a single hour.

03:53.420 --> 03:57.349
I'm only a politician. - You can also be
a good soldier if necessary.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.031
The attack will take place from
the following directions;

04:01.360 --> 04:03.415
Kränzer is coming from the north
with his division

04:03.821 --> 04:06.160
and is pushing them into the canyon.

04:06.323 --> 04:09.100
You will be holding the left bank
of Neretva.

04:09.657 --> 04:13.508
When they are in the kettle, we
will attack them from all sides.

04:15.971 --> 04:19.540
That's it, gentlemen. This is how the
last act will be unwinding.

04:19.901 --> 04:23.628
And here Tito will be fighting,
along with the rest of the partisans.

04:24.149 --> 04:26.566
Thank you.
Good luck!

04:38.841 --> 04:41.054
Mr. general.
Can I make you some tea?

04:41.222 --> 04:43.198
Yes, of course,
my tea.

07:04.911 --> 07:07.564
Doctor!
Hey doctor!

07:13.567 --> 07:17.292
But this is the doctor. -It's not the doctor!
It is the doctor! -It's not the doctor!

07:18.767 --> 07:20.427
Let's run!
The doctor is dead.

07:20.990 --> 07:26.230
If I tell you, it's not the doctor!
He's not dead, it's not the doctor, get lost!

07:45.210 --> 07:47.547
Thank you for your question,
Mr. general.

07:47.671 --> 07:49.885
No, I'm not feeling especially warm.

07:51.403 --> 07:54.102
I understand,
I also don't like this place very much,

07:54.182 --> 07:56.881
but I'm happy
that I have caught up on them.

07:57.239 --> 08:00.254
I will force them into action,
here and now.

08:02.322 --> 08:05.134
I understand, Mr. general.
Over!

08:05.300 --> 08:06.958
You have heard, gentlemen.

08:07.126 --> 08:10.253
Our advance party is already
fighting against the partisans.

08:11.137 --> 08:14.986
Their resistance is strengthening.
With all forces forward!

08:18.005 --> 08:20.025
But, Mr colonel...
-I know, what you want to say;

08:20.466 --> 08:23.674
snow, ice, the north wind... Be happy
it's not raining excrement.

08:47.862 --> 08:49.364
It hurts!

08:49.530 --> 08:51.347
Nada, the instruments!

08:52.865 --> 08:55.235
Instruments, Nada!

08:56.835 --> 08:58.889
What is it?

09:00.924 --> 09:03.781
Fire...
Fire...

09:05.371 --> 09:08.024
I'm cold...
I'm cold...

09:09.343 --> 09:11.125
Nada?

09:18.395 --> 09:20.494
Typhus.

09:22.643 --> 09:25.296
Tell them to cut her hair.

09:30.702 --> 09:34.745
Doctor, please don't
amptutate my leg!

09:40.311 --> 09:45.708
Not my leg, doctor! Not the leg!
It must reach the azure wellspring.

09:47.179 --> 09:49.358
Go away, Nikola.

10:16.442 --> 10:22.076
My friend, gently,
slowly. -Ok.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.400
Nikola.
-How beautiful you are!

10:39.470 --> 10:41.569
Gorgeous!

10:45.306 --> 10:47.519
Hug me!

10:57.733 --> 11:01.143
Retreat!
-They're breaking through, they're breaking through!

11:01.664 --> 11:05.786
Retreat towards the church!
-Save the wounded!

11:20.046 --> 11:22.418
The howitzers are firing too much
to the left again.

11:22.588 --> 11:25.524
Tell these fools to correct
the coordinates!

11:27.352 --> 11:29.724
Howitzers left for 100!

11:30.012 --> 11:32.631
Sergeant Pratzke.
From Mr general.

11:35.728 --> 11:40.134
Warm yourself up at the kettle. It's probably
more pleasant at your place in Konjic.

11:41.129 --> 11:43.308
That's true,
Mr colonel.

11:45.616 --> 11:49.863
What did we get? -100 iron
crosslets EK 1 and 500 EK 2.

11:49.984 --> 11:52.602
The general is generous today.

11:53.517 --> 11:56.329
Is the shock fighting unit appointed? -Yes.

11:57.923 --> 12:00.340
Allow me,
Mr colonel?

12:01.100 --> 12:04.860
Allow me to take over the shock fighting unit.

12:11.066 --> 12:13.685
Too early.
-Mr colonel...

12:17.934 --> 12:20.385
I finally have them!

12:44.337 --> 12:47.465
Danica, guess
what I brought you!

12:49.578 --> 12:51.520
What? -I don't know.

12:52.715 --> 12:54.454
Open it!

12:55.852 --> 12:59.059
I can't. You open it.
Come on, open it.

13:00.417 --> 13:02.314
Open it yourself!

13:12.526 --> 13:15.305
I have waited for us to cross Neretva.

13:22.533 --> 13:26.021
Not now, because of Novak
and the brigade.

13:31.347 --> 13:34.475
You store it.
I love you.

14:28.402 --> 14:33.043
Vlado, Vlado!
What are you doing, damn it!

14:34.476 --> 14:37.683
You have folded the explosive in the
middle of the bridge. What's wrong with you?

14:38.604 --> 14:42.614
An order! You withdraw the people
as far as possible from the bridge.

14:43.409 --> 14:46.028
You're telling me I should
move them away?

14:46.704 --> 14:50.115
What are you planning to do with the bridge?
-I'll destroy it.

14:52.461 --> 14:53.648
The bridge?

14:54.645 --> 14:56.859
Yes, Ivan.
With dynamite.

14:59.172 --> 15:01.385
Listen, Vlado.
This bridge,

15:01.553 --> 15:03.812
is our only hope
and chance of saving ourselves.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.273
And you want to blow it up.

15:07.510 --> 15:10.874
Yes, Ivan.
I will blow it up into the sky.

15:11.123 --> 15:13.821
And when it's destroyed?
What will be do then?

15:14.180 --> 15:16.833
Sit and fish.

15:17.714 --> 15:20.333
Until the Kränzer tanks don't arrive?

15:20.492 --> 15:23.744
I'm fulfilling the orders.
I don't know about the rest.

15:24.186 --> 15:27.516
Orders! That is not order,
it's foolishness!

15:28.394 --> 15:31.725
Who came up with this idea?
-Who gave the order?

15:32.721 --> 15:35.578
If you really want to know...
The headquarters.

15:36.890 --> 15:40.301
I want to know,
because it's about the bridge.

15:41.416 --> 15:44.544
Show me the headquarter's
order. Show it to me!

15:45.307 --> 15:50.580
Novak, typhus.
Look!

15:53.803 --> 15:56.741
Typhus...
He fell sick.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.992
Yes, typhus.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.654
He doesn't have typhus!
-He has typhus. -He doesn't!

16:07.781 --> 16:08.964
Tie him up!

16:12.028 --> 16:15.833
I don't have typhus.
I'm fulfilling an order

16:23.423 --> 16:25.636
Get away from the bridge!
I'll shoot.

16:29.259 --> 16:32.669
I don't have typhus.
Leave me alone!

16:33.667 --> 16:37.156
I have to mine. Without delay.
Move further backwards!

16:38.391 --> 16:42.478
Blood will be shed here.
Mine and yours.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.336
Be careful!
Away from the path.

17:06.938 --> 17:10.066
Vuka, why this mess?
Vlado, blow up the bridge!

17:13.965 --> 17:16.901
How much time do you need?
-Two minutes.

17:18.056 --> 17:20.109
Destroy it immediately!

17:20.397 --> 17:22.689
Engineers,
follow me.

17:23.494 --> 17:26.431
But why,
for God's sake, why?

17:26.551 --> 17:30.358
Did we march for 300 km and drag the
wounded, so we can now pull it down?

17:31.514 --> 17:36.077
Why? Answer me!
-Because we must return to the north.

17:37.392 --> 17:40.124
The hospital in Scit is in danger,
the Germans are attacking it.

17:40.368 --> 17:42.785
And on the other side of the hill the
Chetniks are waiting.

17:42.910 --> 17:45.485
They want to attack us in the back.
We must blow up the bridge.

17:45.769 --> 17:48.343
Ivan, Tito gave the orders for this.

17:48.548 --> 17:51.247
Hold out till the other brigades
don't come. Go!

17:52.399 --> 17:56.804
Brigade, departure!
To the north, comrades! Faster!

18:03.239 --> 18:05.372
Over!

19:09.702 --> 19:14.502
Do we really have to head for that ice
and snow again?

19:23.399 --> 19:26.053
I am not the one to be blamed.
-I'm sick of all of this.

19:26.735 --> 19:29.185
Come on, people.
Come on, come on!

19:29.513 --> 19:31.727
Devil take you!

19:33.604 --> 19:37.455
I am in command over here.
Follow me, typhus people!

19:37.694 --> 19:41.182
It doesn't matter. Bosko doesn't mind
that you blew up the bridge.

19:42.856 --> 19:46.458
We will swim across Neretva.
Typhus people, follow me!

19:48.493 --> 19:51.824
Stop typhus people, get back!
Bosko!

19:53.377 --> 19:57.464
Across the water into freedom.
-Bosko!

20:31.175 --> 20:33.670
Snap-shots,
Mr. general.

20:51.305 --> 20:55.551
It wasn't an accident,
which means they deliberately destroyed it.

20:58.728 --> 21:02.817
I'm asking myself, why did they blow up

21:03.136 --> 21:06.467
their only chance they had left.

21:09.806 --> 21:13.657
What do you think?
There is no other explanation.

21:14.253 --> 21:19.008
Tito must return to the north.
Notify all the units:

21:20.368 --> 21:23.021
abandon your current positions

21:23.544 --> 21:26.988
and take the new way to the north,
over Jablanica.

21:28.228 --> 21:31.041
Detailed instructions to
follow. Tell Kränzer,

21:31.524 --> 21:35.612
that this is his opportunity.
He will get Tito directly into his hands.

21:53.799 --> 21:56.610
Follow me!
Retreat only till the slope.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.759
Run, comrades!

22:02.136 --> 22:05.784
Occupy the slope positions!
-Quickly, cover the retreat!

22:08.330 --> 22:11.221
Lie down here!
-All the rest of you follow me.

22:25.045 --> 22:27.259
Run, comrades!

22:36.916 --> 22:39.966
Comrades, our people have come!
The brigade is here!

23:06.297 --> 23:09.900
Come on, let's go!
Let us go, comrades!

23:16.342 --> 23:19.154
Come on, faster!
Ivan, faster!

23:20.828 --> 23:22.138
Nikola!

23:26.863 --> 23:29.077
How are you, Nikola?
-Guess!

23:30.557 --> 23:34.044
Better?
-You guessed wrong.

23:36.671 --> 23:38.568
Fighter!

23:42.070 --> 23:45.875
They cut my hair.
Tell them to give them back to me.

23:46.596 --> 23:48.810
I will order them,
comrade.

23:49.772 --> 23:53.859
You will order them?
-I will. -Thank you, comrade.

23:54.617 --> 23:57.507
They will give you back your hair.
I'll order it.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.311
Leave!

24:03.629 --> 24:05.098
Go!

24:10.935 --> 24:14.143
Hurry up, comrades!
Faster, run along!

24:17.565 --> 24:21.010
Left wing forward!
-First battalion, to the right!

24:30.429 --> 24:34.755
Artillerymen, forward!
To the shooting lines, let's go!

24:41.665 --> 24:43.923
Quickly, quickly!

24:56.197 --> 24:59.766
Stop! There is no retreat,
comrades!

25:03.582 --> 25:08.100
Stop! Hold still!
-Leave me, they will kill us all.

25:08.625 --> 25:10.520
There is no solution!
-No retreat.

25:10.728 --> 25:13.224
Leave me, I don't want...
The wounded are behind us.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.405
Run, comrades!

26:11.198 --> 26:14.246
Quick, load the cannons!
-I understand, Mr captain!

26:22.514 --> 26:23.698
Fire!

26:31.327 --> 26:33.225
Fire!

27:02.692 --> 27:05.392
Bertram, now it's your turn.

27:07.220 --> 27:10.505
The 3rd in 4th battalion should get ready,
is that clear?

27:34.972 --> 27:38.224
Your interceptors forward!
Did you understand?

27:52.483 --> 27:54.695
Forward!

27:55.778 --> 27:57.516
Fire!

28:00.383 --> 28:02.009
First battery...

28:02.725 --> 28:04.509
.... Fire!

28:12.215 --> 28:14.711
Fire!
-Fire!

28:23.491 --> 28:26.302
Reinhardt. Where are your tanks?
I want the tanks!

28:27.262 --> 28:30.232
I don't care. You think,
we don't have snow over here?

28:31.352 --> 28:36.184
If they don't come in 10 minutes,
I'll go there and shoot you.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.033
Horst!

28:46.837 --> 28:49.772
Horst, now it's your turn.
I can't wait any longer.

28:49.893 --> 28:52.863
Bring me the tanks!
-I understand, Mr colonel.

29:17.290 --> 29:20.416
Stop, stop!

29:22.212 --> 29:24.504
To your positions!
To your positions!

29:26.342 --> 29:28.758
3rd battalion forward!

29:29.478 --> 29:31.657
Reinforce only the first line of battle.
-I understand!

29:31.821 --> 29:33.322
Forward!

29:39.603 --> 29:42.539
This is lieutenant Horst,
in the second tank.

29:42.779 --> 29:44.518
All tanks forward!

30:47.060 --> 30:51.417
Captain, stop...
Tanks over there, directly.

30:51.744 --> 30:53.878
Quick, quick!

30:54.127 --> 30:57.141
Cannons on the ridge!
Quick, the tanks are approaching.

30:58.295 --> 31:00.554
Forward, forward!

31:36.887 --> 31:39.744
Prepare yourself for the
shooting

31:46.695 --> 31:48.716
Load, quickly!

31:53.046 --> 31:55.700
Close!

32:43.789 --> 32:45.765
The bottle!

32:47.560 --> 32:49.423
Let's go!

33:26.271 --> 33:27.773
Fire!

33:33.577 --> 33:35.755
I don't see!

33:41.200 --> 33:43.334
My eyes!

33:56.605 --> 33:59.382
Riva!
Marija!

34:00.258 --> 34:01.997
No, the doctor can't help me.

34:02.482 --> 34:05.575
Why not?
Marija!

34:06.690 --> 34:09.310
It's too late,
it's all over for me.

34:09.469 --> 34:11.253
Hold on, Riva!

34:15.623 --> 34:19.226
Listen, please.
Take this letter.

34:20.705 --> 34:25.301
The lamella has my name,
surname and address.

34:26.780 --> 34:28.598
Send it...

34:30.074 --> 34:34.717
Send it to my wife.
Do this for me...

35:10.970 --> 35:12.990
Fire!

35:27.765 --> 35:31.253
Comrade Vuka, did they kill you?
-Leave me alone! -Comrade Vuka.

35:31.457 --> 35:33.670
Where are you, Vuka?

35:55.200 --> 35:56.543
Martin!

35:57.582 --> 36:00.632
Martin, Martin.
-Fire!

36:01.076 --> 36:03.255
What should we do, Martin?
-Fire!

36:03.419 --> 36:05.282
They will kill us all.

36:06.794 --> 36:09.164
Calm down, Marija.
-They will kill us.

36:10.049 --> 36:13.460
Don't panic. Sing a song.
Fire!

36:16.877 --> 36:20.638
Sumadija man, a song!
You start!

36:22.517 --> 36:25.136
Let's sing, the wounded!

36:31.370 --> 36:35.380
Down with injustice and violence!

36:37.326 --> 36:40.612
The nation is now calling you to the judgement.

36:41.058 --> 36:44.503
Run from us,
nightly darkness,

36:45.148 --> 36:47.960
our day has come too.

36:48.165 --> 36:51.338
Run from us,
nightly darkness,

36:52.611 --> 36:55.231
out day has come too...

38:17.261 --> 38:18.920
Tera.
-Yes!

38:19.801 --> 38:23.008
What is this?
-I don't know.

38:47.277 --> 38:49.376
Tera.
-Yes!

38:50.095 --> 38:52.828
Ustasha's into attack!
-I understand.

38:58.115 --> 39:00.734
Drum stronger!

39:06.096 --> 39:08.355
Storm the hospital!

39:33.888 --> 39:37.062
Attack!
-Attack!

40:46.189 --> 40:48.211
Lie down!

40:48.532 --> 40:52.732
Don't! Take care of yourself!
I beg you, brother.

40:54.527 --> 40:56.943
Follow me!

40:59.728 --> 41:02.585
Forward,
black legion!

42:41.290 --> 42:44.103
Stipe, ask the right wing why
they're not answering the calls.

42:44.348 --> 42:46.525
I understand!
-Listen.

42:48.119 --> 42:50.819
The other brigades should also answer back
every half an hour.

42:51.018 --> 42:52.835
I understand!

42:55.186 --> 42:57.242
Faster, boys!

43:08.289 --> 43:11.225
Colonel Kränzer.
Yes, I'll wait.

43:14.443 --> 43:16.657
We have to stop them.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.988
Strike with all forces! Tito wants
to go to the north, into Bosnia.

43:22.185 --> 43:25.833
And you must prevent that from happening.
I rely on you.

43:27.625 --> 43:31.272
Listen, I haven't told you this
yet, but you already know;

43:32.390 --> 43:36.590
you are my best man and your
division is my best unit.

43:37.510 --> 43:40.921
Kränzer, send the soldiers
once more into attack.

43:41.719 --> 43:44.418
Don't entrench yourselves.
Don't miss the opportunity.

43:44.537 --> 43:47.711
Kränzer, I won't let you down.

43:48.867 --> 43:51.520
You can rely on me.
I will send you the Anacker group

43:51.645 --> 43:54.297
and the Chetniks.
Don't wait till they attack.

43:54.703 --> 43:58.113
You attack! It seems though,
that we are in a tough position,

43:58.991 --> 44:02.085
but Tito is actually the one in the problematical
position.

44:03.556 --> 44:07.316
He must head to the north and that
way you will get him directly

44:07.726 --> 44:11.847
in front of the tanks and cannons.
We have gone through a lot of things in this life.

44:13.006 --> 44:16.450
I am speaking to you as comrade
and as a friend.

44:16.778 --> 44:19.318
It all depends on you now.

44:19.597 --> 44:22.645
I understand, Mr general.
Into counterattack. Over!

44:41.513 --> 44:42.903
Horst!

44:44.808 --> 44:47.305
I'm sorry,
Schröder!

44:49.176 --> 44:52.745
We're proceeding into defense.
-But Mr colonel...

44:52.987 --> 44:56.353
I didn't ask you for
an opinion, Schröder.

44:58.189 --> 45:00.368
Into defense!

45:00.770 --> 45:04.529
Entrench, send the reconnoitering parties,
wait for the partisans to attack.

45:05.971 --> 45:08.546
Is that clear,
captain Schröder?

45:08.989 --> 45:11.009
Yes, Mr colonel.

45:11.529 --> 45:16.520
Repeat that! - Entrench, send the
reconnoitering parties, wait for the
partisans .

45:18.915 --> 45:22.245
And that order will be fulfilled.

46:52.972 --> 46:54.711
Partisans, partisans!

46:56.188 --> 46:58.289
Forward!

47:04.923 --> 47:08.289
Come on, after them!
Come here, Novak!

47:27.595 --> 47:30.169
Bring the supporter,
quick, quick.

47:39.663 --> 47:42.001
Come on, boys!
Quick!

47:42.880 --> 47:45.974
The brigades are waiting.
Hurry up!

47:57.372 --> 48:00.308
.... vigorously they step, heads
up, on the meadow,

48:00.588 --> 48:04.394
full of danger, threat...
From the soul of the entire nation is rising

48:05.113 --> 48:07.847
a defiant scream
of faith and hope.

48:08.448 --> 48:11.971
Forward, comrades!
All paths are now open.

48:12.539 --> 48:15.475
There are no dead,
life reigns.

48:16.033 --> 48:19.839
I am a part of this column with no end,
which walks since ancient times,

48:20.399 --> 48:22.941
from the beginning,
in the dusky forests,

48:23.100 --> 48:25.234
on winter thorny paths,

48:25.522 --> 48:27.700
when one falls,
another rises instantly.

48:27.865 --> 48:29.524
Comrade poet!

48:29.730 --> 48:32.147
We're going to the brigade
with Jordan.

48:32.391 --> 48:35.599
Mario will take care of you,
the cow and the books. Is that ok?

48:36.083 --> 48:39.256
That's ok, Zika, now it's not hard anymore.
-Thank you, comrade poet.

48:39.816 --> 48:43.982
Mario! You take bene care of Nazor,
the cow and the books, do you understand?

48:44.422 --> 48:47.040
Nazor safe, cow good,
everything safe!

48:47.200 --> 48:49.142
Ciao, Mario.
-Ciao, Zika.

48:50.654 --> 48:53.273
Hello, Likota.
Hello!

48:53.433 --> 48:56.641
Uncle Nazor,
good bye then!

48:57.801 --> 48:59.979
Good bye Zika,
good luck!

49:00.780 --> 49:03.907
No offence, comrade poet.
Drivers... -Farewell!

49:04.114 --> 49:06.293
Ciao Mario! -Ciao Zika!
-Wait, Jordan!

49:06.456 --> 49:09.471
Who will you leave our bus
to?

49:16.183 --> 49:19.120
When I tell you, push.
-Ok.

49:25.553 --> 49:28.331
Hey, my darling,
you were good.

49:29.406 --> 49:32.137
Take care down there.
-Go!

50:09.506 --> 50:15.018
Send the Chetniks immediately back
to Neretva. On the shortest path.

50:18.559 --> 50:22.760
Only constant bombarding of the
bridge can save us.

50:33.526 --> 50:36.541
Bravo! You showed them well
those bearded people.

50:36.703 --> 50:39.040
Novak, now to the hill and
stop the Chetniks.

50:39.204 --> 50:41.542
As long as the brigades don't arrive.
And no retreating!

50:41.706 --> 50:44.246
I understand!
Prepare for departure!

50:44.327 --> 50:47.737
Stipe, tell Martin, that Ivan will
attack the Chetniks from the middle,

50:47.900 --> 50:50.316
and I will attack them from the back.
Let him fire from all the cannons.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.535
This time we must destroy them once
and for all. -I understand!

50:53.657 --> 50:56.151
Set out immediately!
-Novak, the tins.

50:56.397 --> 50:58.767
Thank you, my friend.
-Danica, stay here.

51:00.605 --> 51:03.574
I want to be with Novak.
-This time he can be without you.

51:03.741 --> 51:06.237
Stay with me.
-I will wait for you above.

51:12.795 --> 51:16.080
I hardly managed to shake off the poets
cow and the books.

52:02.899 --> 52:05.519
Take care of the distance.
-Will you manage, Jordan?

52:05.680 --> 52:07.701
I can, if i have to.

52:07.864 --> 52:10.313
Step on the gas, Jordan!
-Be quiet, you poor devil.

52:10.484 --> 52:12.222
Shift to the third!

52:12.985 --> 52:15.999
Be quiet, you poor devil! For you it's a cow,
not a gun.

52:18.901 --> 52:20.244
Keep it quiet!

54:08.483 --> 54:11.294
Children, children...

54:15.153 --> 54:19.715
.... don't go out, children.
Don't move.

54:34.290 --> 54:36.910
Help, help...

55:26.899 --> 55:28.919
Eat faster!

55:29.837 --> 55:31.416
Jordan.

55:33.053 --> 55:35.784
If you come to me,
you get a preserve.

55:38.690 --> 55:41.264
I don't fall for
preserves.

55:43.573 --> 55:46.306
Where are the beardos, Dana?
-Close.

55:51.593 --> 55:53.885
Come on Novak,
hurry!

55:54.929 --> 55:58.610
I wont eat it in haste.
I'll finish it later in peace.

56:11.883 --> 56:14.817
Don't start firing before I do!

56:58.455 --> 57:01.154
Fire! -Fire!
-Fire on the left.

57:02.623 --> 57:05.479
1st battery...
fire!

57:11.517 --> 57:14.725
He have a delay.
We're late, commander.

57:15.884 --> 57:18.775
Order your officers an immediate
retreat of all units!

57:20.690 --> 57:22.314
Did you understand me?

57:25.651 --> 57:28.825
What is it, senator?
What retreat?

57:29.900 --> 57:33.074
Did you get scare?
-No, I won't allow...

57:33.276 --> 57:36.131
Our best squads must not be
surrounded and destroyed.

57:36.292 --> 57:38.991
The Germans have come off badly,
and without them we are ruined.

57:39.191 --> 57:41.369
This is a battle to the last men.

57:41.851 --> 57:44.584
Why?
Why to the last?

57:45.781 --> 57:49.349
Because Chetniks know no retreat,
senator, that's why!

57:49.475 --> 57:53.234
Commander, you must know how to wait,too.
That is a tactic too.

57:53.444 --> 57:57.962
Wait how long? -Ok,
let's leave this things.

57:58.685 --> 58:01.813
I want to win the war,
not just one battle.

58:02.021 --> 58:04.640
You will win it only with battle,
not by retreating.

58:04.800 --> 58:06.820
By fighting to the last breath.

58:06.944 --> 58:10.072
Let them fight!
Let them shed their blood!

58:11.034 --> 58:15.912
We will wait, save our force,
until the right moment comes.

58:16.235 --> 58:19.408
Now is the right moment!
-For them it is.

58:19.688 --> 58:22.941
I make the decisions! I am the Royal
commander.

58:23.620 --> 58:26.984
The army was entrusted to me.
-I represent the king and the government!

58:27.907 --> 58:30.922
That is treason, senator.
I will destroy every person,

58:31.124 --> 58:33.020
that will be standing on my way.

58:38.349 --> 58:40.687
The pistol!

58:42.439 --> 58:44.618
Give it to him.

58:57.844 --> 59:01.853
In the name of the king, in the name
of the government, in the name of the
movement

59:04.038 --> 59:05.585
I order retreat...

59:19.602 --> 59:22.379
Captain, officers!

59:29.329 --> 59:31.543
To the bridge!
-I understand!

59:33.935 --> 59:36.791
Here with the building materials!
Faster!

59:39.533 --> 59:42.785
Give me timber!
Ram in the cramps!

01:00:08.675 --> 01:00:10.809
Forward, battalions!

01:00:34.522 --> 01:00:37.854
More lively, comrades!
The Chetniks are putting pressure.

01:00:46.633 --> 01:00:49.082
1st battery...
Fire!

01:00:57.432 --> 01:00:59.769
Mine throwers, to your positions!

01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:05.412
Prepare the elements!
Quick!

01:01:06.444 --> 01:01:08.105
Let's go!

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:36.729
Back!

01:01:57.066 --> 01:01:58.376
Dana.

01:01:59.529 --> 01:02:01.108
Dana!

01:02:06.635 --> 01:02:08.656
I'm coming, Zika.

01:02:12.393 --> 01:02:14.571
I'm coming.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.707
Move away, I'll do it.

01:02:31.171 --> 01:02:33.792
Danica, over here.

01:02:37.723 --> 01:02:40.139
I'm already here!

01:02:44.831 --> 01:02:48.761
Comrade commander. The Chetniks
will destroy Novak's platoon. Attack!

01:02:49.277 --> 01:02:52.246
Novak will fall and everyone with him.
Attack!

01:02:57.457 --> 01:02:59.827
It's still early.

01:03:01.983 --> 01:03:04.321
Comrade commander.
We must attack.

01:03:04.524 --> 01:03:06.782
They will shoot them down.
Stole!

01:03:07.105 --> 01:03:08.572
Listen, Stipe.

01:03:08.733 --> 01:03:10.946
Until I completely surround the Chetniks,
there will be no attack.

01:03:11.194 --> 01:03:14.006
Novak and his platoon...
-What are you waiting for! Transmit the order!

01:03:14.766 --> 01:03:17.106
Go!
-I understand!

01:03:29.577 --> 01:03:32.071
Come, Dana!
-At once.

01:03:47.046 --> 01:03:50.615
Dana, take the call!
-I'm here. -Ok.

01:04:00.466 --> 01:04:02.758
Dana, help!

01:04:11.703 --> 01:04:13.328
Another one!

01:04:20.318 --> 01:04:22.215
I'm coming...

01:04:34.652 --> 01:04:39.089
Dana!
-Fire, fire!

01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:51.796
Fire!

01:04:54.027 --> 01:04:55.494
Dana!

01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:24.984
Don't uncover yourself!
Prepare the bombs!

01:07:21.248 --> 01:07:23.619
Get back!
Retreat!

01:07:23.908 --> 01:07:28.234
Get back! There is no retreat!
Attack! To the bridge, forward!

01:07:29.268 --> 01:07:31.527
Mr. lieutenant colonel,
we're surrounded.

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:34.146
The partisans have attacked us in our
back.

01:07:45.904 --> 01:07:47.292
Follow me!

01:07:47.732 --> 01:07:52.326
Over here, turn around!
Follow me, over here! Turn around!

01:07:54.242 --> 01:07:57.527
Turn around!
-Into breakthrough!

01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:26.948
Let them come close and
cold-blooded!

01:08:36.328 --> 01:08:38.620
Bombs!

01:08:39.107 --> 01:08:41.555
Attack with the bombs!

01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:48.752
Now!

01:08:57.411 --> 01:08:59.228
Forward!

01:09:02.135 --> 01:09:05.580
Forward
Stand up! Get up!

01:09:06.265 --> 01:09:09.787
Work your way through!
I'll kill you all!

01:09:15.634 --> 01:09:18.051
Into battle!
Cowards!

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:38.299
Get down, you fool!

01:11:25.863 --> 01:11:28.956
Novak, Novak...

01:12:01.994 --> 01:12:06.082
What will I do without
you, Novak?

01:12:14.818 --> 01:12:16.319
Stipe!

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:28.269
Hold your fire!
Stipe!

01:12:31.374 --> 01:12:33.950
Get out of the way, Ivan!
Move away!

01:12:34.114 --> 01:12:37.051
Stipe. -Get out of my way Ivan,
make way!

01:12:37.489 --> 01:12:39.939
Stipe, stop!

01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:44.433
What are you doing?

01:12:44.596 --> 01:12:47.847
Who gave you the right to shoot
at captives?

01:12:48.526 --> 01:12:50.502
Stand still!

01:12:51.663 --> 01:12:53.560
Shame on you!

01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:00.397
Go!

01:13:01.548 --> 01:13:03.650
Get lost!

01:13:04.884 --> 01:13:07.459
You will be brought before a
court-martial.

01:15:55.491 --> 01:15:57.863
Light the fire!
-I know how to do that.

01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:11.728
What's wrong with you? Why are
you so gloomy ?

01:16:13.318 --> 01:16:16.887
And you just sing.
Sing and burn down.

01:16:17.923 --> 01:16:20.938
Of course we sing.
We're crossing Neretva.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:25.855
Don't mourn, Martin. There will be more
cannons. Many of them..

01:16:27.254 --> 01:16:29.829
Soon you will be as happy
as before.

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:33.959
Happy, you say?

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:40.623
I'll be happy, when there will be
no wars and no cannons. Do you understand?

01:16:44.883 --> 01:16:47.378
We all think that way sometimes.

01:16:47.702 --> 01:16:52.184
I have been demolishing, burning down,
leaving ruins behind me for 3 years.

01:16:55.008 --> 01:16:59.050
Sometimes I dream about bridges,
that I will set up.

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:04.455
What can we do! That's how it is,
my Slovenian.

01:17:05.925 --> 01:17:08.816
Go, so you won't be late.
-I won't be.

01:17:10.133 --> 01:17:12.472
Faster, engineers!

01:17:18.511 --> 01:17:20.092
Push!

01:17:51.068 --> 01:17:53.959
Slowly, slowly comrades.

01:17:55.316 --> 01:17:58.649
She's just sleeping.
Only sleeping.

01:18:09.888 --> 01:18:13.851
Nikola, you can see
that...

01:18:16.042 --> 01:18:17.825
She's not dead.

01:18:18.782 --> 01:18:21.153
Just sleeping.

01:18:21.681 --> 01:18:24.334
That's right. Let her sleep...

01:18:25.809 --> 01:18:29.299
Let's take her to the house.
Put her here, comrades!

01:18:48.877 --> 01:18:51.655
Comrade.
Look, comrade.

01:18:53.999 --> 01:18:56.449
What a beautiful corpse!

01:19:00.113 --> 01:19:03.050
It's looking, it sees us.

01:19:05.275 --> 01:19:07.409
It's looking at me!

01:19:12.421 --> 01:19:16.543
Nikola, Nikola!

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:55.975
Nikola, let's go!

01:20:00.701 --> 01:20:02.801
Nikola!

01:20:12.692 --> 01:20:14.906
What's your name?
-Mirko.

01:20:15.115 --> 01:20:17.056
And yours?
-Mira.

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:20.462
I know uncle, how
they call you.

01:20:20.634 --> 01:20:23.840
How do they call me?
-Gunner Martin.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.891
Now you don't have any left.
-I don't.
