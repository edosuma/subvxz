00:56.456 --> 00:57.548
Dora!

10:31.020 --> 10:32.543
Fable!

10:34.856 --> 10:36.016
Fable!

10:36.091 --> 10:37.115
Huh?

11:20.663 --> 11:22.756
All right. Hold still now.

12:03.099 --> 12:05.260
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

12:11.006 --> 12:14.373
Well...
Oh, sorry.

12:14.476 --> 12:15.669
No, thanks.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.210
Well, you're
in good health.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.937
So how's Judith
and the kids?

12:21.015 --> 12:23.676
Good. Everyone's good,
you know.

12:23.783 --> 12:26.513
Danny must be, what?
About to be bar mitzvah?

12:26.620 --> 12:27.814
Two weeks.

12:27.888 --> 12:29.879
Well, mazel tov!

12:30.523 --> 12:32.320
They grow up fast,
don't they?

12:54.744 --> 12:55.904
Hmm...

13:03.185 --> 13:04.174
Hmm...

13:13.327 --> 13:14.385
Yeah, you put the...

13:38.448 --> 13:39.415
That's right, you put the...

14:11.410 --> 14:12.877
You following this?

14:13.646 --> 14:14.771
Okay?

14:16.147 --> 14:17.273
So...

14:18.917 --> 14:20.475
This part is exciting.

14:22.453 --> 14:25.081
So, am I right?

14:25.322 --> 14:26.619
So, okay So...

14:26.724 --> 14:29.624
So, if that's that,
then we can do this.

14:30.727 --> 14:32.786
And that's Schrödinger's Paradox, right?

14:32.929 --> 14:34.487
Is the cat dead?

14:35.265 --> 14:37.562
Or is the cat
not dead?

14:37.733 --> 14:38.825
Messages,
Professor Gopnik.

14:38.934 --> 14:40.333
Thank you, Natalie.

14:40.736 --> 14:42.670
Oh, Clive, come in.

14:46.974 --> 14:50.000
So, what can I do for you?

14:51.344 --> 14:53.574
Dr Gopnik, I believe the results

14:53.647 --> 14:55.740
of the physics midterm
were unjust.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.472
Uh-huh? How so?

14:58.584 --> 15:00.814
I received
unsatisfactory grade.

15:00.919 --> 15:03.149
In fact, F,
the failing grade.

15:03.689 --> 15:06.919
Yes. You failed the midterm.
That's accurate.

15:06.991 --> 15:08.583
Yes, but that is not just.

15:08.826 --> 15:11.795
I was unaware to be
examined on the mathematics.

15:11.863 --> 15:15.025
Well, you can't do physics without
mathematics, really, can you?

15:15.132 --> 15:18.590
If I receive the failing
grade, I lose my scholarship,

15:18.669 --> 15:19.966
and I feel shame.

15:20.370 --> 15:23.702
I understand the physics.
I understand the dead cat.

15:23.806 --> 15:27.367
But you can't really
understand the physics

15:27.476 --> 15:29.204
without understanding
the math.

15:29.311 --> 15:33.042
The math tells how it really
works That's the real thing.

15:33.148 --> 15:36.708
The stories I give you in
class are just illustrative.

15:36.817 --> 15:40.651
They're like fables, say,
to help give you a picture.

15:40.721 --> 15:42.018
I mean...

15:43.289 --> 15:45.689
Even I don't understand
the dead cat.

15:45.792 --> 15:47.657
The math is how
it really works.

15:47.727 --> 15:49.058
Very difficult.

15:49.562 --> 15:50.550
Very difficult.

15:50.662 --> 15:52.653
Well, I'm sorry, but I...

15:52.731 --> 15:53.823
What do you propose?

15:53.899 --> 15:55.025
- Passing grade.
- No, no.

15:55.133 --> 15:57.328
Or perhaps I can
take the midterm again.

15:57.402 --> 15:59.164
I know now it cover
the mathematics.

15:59.236 --> 16:01.966
Well, the other students
wouldn't like that, would they?

16:02.039 --> 16:05.565
If one student gets to retake the
test until he gets a grade he likes?

16:06.910 --> 16:08.309
- Secret test
- No...

16:08.645 --> 16:10.010
- Hush-hush.
- No.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.638
That's just not workable.

16:11.715 --> 16:14.740
I'm afraid we'll just have to bite
the bullet on this thing, Clive...

16:14.850 --> 16:16.215
Very troubling.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.179
Very troubling.

16:32.999 --> 16:34.330
Sy Able man.

16:34.401 --> 16:36.493
Hello, Sy
Larry Gopnik.

16:36.936 --> 16:39.404
Larry. How are you,
my friend?

16:39.672 --> 16:41.162
Good How you been, Sy?

16:41.240 --> 16:44.072
Fine Can
we talk, Larry?

16:44.175 --> 16:45.836
What? You...
Uh...

16:46.277 --> 16:48.177
Hello? Larry?

16:48.279 --> 16:49.507
Call back!

16:49.580 --> 16:50.740
Clive!

17:03.626 --> 17:04.887
That was Sy Able man.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.358
He said he
got disconnected.

17:09.564 --> 17:10.553
Out in a minute.

17:10.632 --> 17:12.861
I got to wash my hair.
I'm going out tonight.

17:12.933 --> 17:13.957
I'll be out in a minute.

17:14.068 --> 17:15.535
Jesus Christ!

17:17.271 --> 17:19.295
Why is Uncle Arthur
always in the bathroom?

17:19.406 --> 17:21.636
He has to drain his
sebaceous cyst. You know that.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.765
Will you set the table?

17:22.876 --> 17:25.106
Why can't he do it in the
basement or out in the garage?

17:28.714 --> 17:31.581
I had 20 bucks in it,
too. Inside the case.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.140
Twenty bucks?
How come?

17:33.419 --> 17:36.410
Bought a lid from Mike
Fable a couple of weeks ago.

17:36.487 --> 17:37.579
Still owed him 20.

17:37.655 --> 17:39.316
He already
gave you the pot?

17:39.590 --> 17:42.752
Yeah. But a couple of weeks
ago, my funding got cut off.

17:43.126 --> 17:45.594
Fable said he'd pound the crap
out of me if I didn't pay up.

17:45.662 --> 17:47.926
What funding got cut off?
Where do you get your money?

17:47.998 --> 17:48.964
What happened?

17:49.064 --> 17:50.929
Rabbi Turchik took his
radio Had money in it.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.262
That fucker!

17:52.334 --> 17:54.131
Yeah. I think he said
he was confiscating it.

17:54.236 --> 17:56.067
He's a fucker. Where
do you get your money?

17:56.138 --> 17:57.661
Mike Fable’s
going to kick his ass.

17:57.772 --> 18:00.240
Last week he pounded the
crap out of Seth Seddlemeyer.

18:00.308 --> 18:01.570
He's a fucker!

18:01.643 --> 18:03.803
- Fable or Seth Seddlemeyer?
- They're both fuckers!

18:04.745 --> 18:05.769
Out in a minute!

18:05.846 --> 18:06.938
Are you still in there?

18:07.014 --> 18:08.845
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute!

18:33.837 --> 18:34.861
Arthur!

18:34.971 --> 18:36.461
- Yeah?
- Dinner!

18:36.873 --> 18:38.602
Okay,out in a minute!

18:38.675 --> 18:39.835
We should wait.

18:39.943 --> 18:41.170
Are you kidding?

18:48.483 --> 18:51.281
Mr. Brandt keeps mowing
part of our lawn.

18:51.519 --> 18:52.816
Does that matter?

18:53.120 --> 18:54.212
What?

18:54.355 --> 18:55.821
JUDITH: Is it important?

18:57.324 --> 18:58.655
It's just odd.

18:58.725 --> 19:01.489
Mom, how long is Uncle
Arthur staying with us?

19:01.561 --> 19:03.118
Ask your father.

19:51.838 --> 19:52.998
Honey.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.063
Honey.

19:55.173 --> 19:56.401
Did you talk to Sy?

19:56.909 --> 19:58.103
Sy?

19:59.411 --> 20:02.073
Sy Able man That's
right, he called But I...

20:02.180 --> 20:03.703
- You didn't talk to him?
- No.

20:05.850 --> 20:08.250
You know the problems that
you and I have been having?

20:08.352 --> 20:09.376
Mmm-hmm.

20:09.453 --> 20:12.080
Well, Sy and I
have become very close.

20:13.924 --> 20:18.587
In short, I think it's time that
we start talking about a divorce.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.391
Sy Able man?

20:25.466 --> 20:26.899
This is not about Sy.

20:26.968 --> 20:28.560
You mentioned Sy!

20:28.636 --> 20:30.729
Don't twist my words,
Larry.

20:30.805 --> 20:33.364
A divorce? What have I done?
I haven't done anything.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.305
Larry, don't be a child.

20:35.409 --> 20:38.139
You haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

20:38.245 --> 20:41.407
Yes! Yes, we haven't
done anything.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.472
And I'm probably
about to get tenure.

20:44.584 --> 20:47.984
Nevertheless, there have
been problems, as you know...

20:48.086 --> 20:50.418
- Well...
- ... and things have changed.

20:50.488 --> 20:52.319
And then, Sy Able man.

20:52.791 --> 20:54.088
Sy has come into
my life, and I...

20:54.159 --> 20:58.254
Come into your... What does
that mean? You barely know him.

20:58.329 --> 21:00.456
Oh, please We've known the
Aleman’s for 15 years, Larry!

21:00.564 --> 21:04.158
Yes, but you said
we hadn't done anything.

21:04.467 --> 21:06.958
I haven't done anything.

21:07.303 --> 21:09.998
This is not some
flashy fling, Larry.

21:10.105 --> 21:12.903
This is not about
woopsy-doopsy.

21:14.776 --> 21:16.471
Sy Able man?

21:16.844 --> 21:18.436
- I'll be out in a minute!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

21:18.512 --> 21:20.104
Look, I didn't know any other
way of breaking it to you

21:20.181 --> 21:22.979
except to just tell you
and treat you like an adult.

21:23.084 --> 21:24.573
Is that so wrong?

21:25.485 --> 21:26.679
Where do I sleep?

21:26.853 --> 21:28.912
- What?
- Arthur's on the couch.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.614
Look, Sy feels
that we should...

21:30.690 --> 21:33.123
Esther is barely cold!

21:33.192 --> 21:35.126
Esther died three years ago,

21:35.194 --> 21:37.628
and it was a loveless marriage.

21:39.364 --> 21:40.797
Sy wants a get.

21:43.968 --> 21:45.492
- A what?
- A ritual divorce.

21:45.603 --> 21:47.194
He says it's very important.

21:47.304 --> 21:50.330
Without a get,
I'm an agene.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.532
A what?

21:51.642 --> 21:53.200
What are you
talking about?

21:53.310 --> 21:55.709
You always act
so surprised.

21:55.811 --> 21:58.302
I have begged you
to see the Rabbi.

22:37.181 --> 22:38.647
Messages,
Professor Gopnik.

22:48.390 --> 22:50.585
Yes, thanks for coming,
Clive. Have a seat.

22:54.062 --> 22:57.930
We had, I think, a
good talk the other day,

22:59.033 --> 23:01.057
...but you left something...
- I didn't leave it.

23:03.603 --> 23:05.867
Well, you don't even know
what I was going to say.

23:05.939 --> 23:07.372
I didn't leave anything.

23:07.441 --> 23:08.873
I'm not missing anything.

23:08.941 --> 23:10.738
I know where everything is.

23:12.178 --> 23:14.942
Well then, Clive...

23:15.914 --> 23:17.404
Where did this come from?

23:21.720 --> 23:23.277
This is here, isn't it?

23:23.854 --> 23:25.219
Yes, sir.
That is there.

23:25.289 --> 23:26.381
This is not nothing.

23:26.457 --> 23:27.788
This is something.

23:28.759 --> 23:30.623
Yes. That is something.

23:31.928 --> 23:34.055
- What is it?
- You know what it is, I believe.

23:35.064 --> 23:37.725
- And you know I can't keep it, Clive.
- Yes, sir.

23:37.799 --> 23:39.699
I'll have to pass it on
to Professor Finkle,

23:40.302 --> 23:42.566
along with my suspicions
about where it came from.

23:42.637 --> 23:44.434
Actions have consequences.

23:44.539 --> 23:45.562
Yes. Often.

23:45.639 --> 23:48.073
No, always! Actions
always have consequences!

23:48.142 --> 23:51.043
In this office, actions
have consequences.

23:51.112 --> 23:52.806
- Yes, sir.
- Not just physics,

23:52.912 --> 23:54.140
...morally.
- Yes.

23:54.247 --> 23:55.976
And we both know
about your actions.

23:56.082 --> 23:58.050
No, sir.
I know about my actions.

23:58.118 --> 24:01.746
I can interpret, Clive I know
what you meant me to understand.

24:01.820 --> 24:03.447
Meer sir my sir.

24:06.959 --> 24:08.892
"Meer sir my sir"?

24:08.960 --> 24:12.327
Mere surmise, sir.

24:13.331 --> 24:14.820
Very uncertain.

24:48.027 --> 24:49.289
You little brat fucker!

24:49.362 --> 24:51.489
You snuck 20 bucks
out of my drawer!

24:51.863 --> 24:53.660
Studying Torah,
asshole.

24:53.765 --> 24:55.699
You little brat!
I'm telling Dad!

24:56.034 --> 24:58.161
You going to tell him you've been
sneaking it out of his wallet?

24:58.270 --> 25:01.466
You know what I'm going to do, you
little brat, if you don't give it back?

25:02.206 --> 25:03.468
Dad?

25:03.874 --> 25:06.138
Dad, you've
got to fix the aerial.

25:06.210 --> 25:08.200
Hello, Larry. Have you
thought about a lawyer?

25:08.311 --> 25:09.608
- Dad!
- Honey, please!

25:09.679 --> 25:10.771
We're not getting
channel four at all.

25:10.847 --> 25:12.144
Can we
discuss it later?

25:12.215 --> 25:13.375
I can't get F Troop.

25:13.483 --> 25:14.813
Larry, the
children know.

25:14.883 --> 25:16.282
Do you think
this is some secret?

25:16.351 --> 25:17.875
Do you think this is something
we're going to keep quiet?

25:17.986 --> 25:19.544
Dad, Uncle Arthur is
in the bathroom again,

25:19.655 --> 25:20.815
and I'm going
to the Hole at 8:00.

25:20.889 --> 25:22.150
- Out in a minute!
- Ow! Stop!

25:22.223 --> 25:24.214
- She keeps doing that!
- What's going on?

25:52.916 --> 25:54.144
Arthur?

25:54.551 --> 25:55.575
Yes?

25:56.920 --> 25:58.387
What are you doing?

26:00.923 --> 26:02.982
Working on the Meticulous.

26:05.728 --> 26:07.695
Any luck, um,

26:09.264 --> 26:10.822
looking for an apartment?

26:14.168 --> 26:15.192
No.

26:32.451 --> 26:34.282
- Sy.
- Good to see you, Larry.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.109
I'll get Judith.

26:37.221 --> 26:41.123
No, listen, actually, I'm
here to see you, if I might.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.689
Such a thing
Such a thing.

26:44.761 --> 26:45.785
Shall we go
in the kitchen?

26:45.896 --> 26:50.628
You know, Larry, the way we
handle ourselves in this situation,

26:51.567 --> 26:52.898
so important.

26:52.968 --> 26:54.697
- Uh-huh?
- Absolutely.

26:54.770 --> 26:56.294
Judith told me that she
broke the news to you,

26:56.405 --> 26:59.430
and she said that
you were very adult.

26:59.941 --> 27:01.408
- Did she?
- Absolutely.

27:01.743 --> 27:03.870
The respect she has
for you...

27:04.746 --> 27:06.474
- Yes?
- Do you drink wine?

27:06.813 --> 27:08.075
Because this is
an incredible bottle.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.410
This is not
Megan David, Larry.

27:09.483 --> 27:12.213
This is a wine A Bordeaux.

27:12.286 --> 27:13.912
- You know, Sy...
- Open it.

27:13.986 --> 27:16.580
Let it breathe.
Ten minutes.

27:16.656 --> 27:19.124
Letting it breathe,
so important.

27:19.225 --> 27:20.987
Thanks, Sy,
but I'm not...

27:21.092 --> 27:23.583
Listen, I insist, Larry.
There's no cause for discomfort.

27:23.662 --> 27:25.721
I'd be uncomfortable
if you didn't take it.

27:25.797 --> 27:27.923
Larry, listen.
These are signs.

27:27.998 --> 27:29.260
Tokens, Larry.

27:29.333 --> 27:30.732
I'm just...
I'm not ungrateful.

27:30.801 --> 27:32.063
I just don't know
a lot about wine,

27:32.136 --> 27:33.660
...and given our...
- It's okay.

27:34.271 --> 27:36.431
...respective...
- It's okay.

27:38.641 --> 27:42.133
Larry, we're
going to be fine.

27:49.984 --> 27:51.349
Want some of this,
fucker?

28:24.147 --> 28:25.205
Fuck.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.314
Would you read this?
Tell me what you think?

31:41.284 --> 31:42.376
Okay.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.784
Boy! You should have
worn a hat.

32:10.242 --> 32:12.176
Let's see
some hustle, Mitch.

32:58.084 --> 32:59.244
Larry?

33:00.286 --> 33:01.752
Hi, Arlen.

33:02.387 --> 33:07.552
Larry, I feel that as head of the
tenure committee, I should tell you this.

33:07.960 --> 33:13.363
Though it should be no cause for concern,
and you should not at all be worried.

33:13.731 --> 33:14.755
Okay.

33:14.865 --> 33:17.389
But I feel
I should mention it,

33:17.467 --> 33:21.426
even though it will carry
no weight in our decision

33:21.538 --> 33:23.096
on whether or not
to grant you tenure.

33:23.206 --> 33:25.867
So again,
no cause for concern.

33:25.941 --> 33:28.375
Okay, Arlen
Give what any weight?

33:29.612 --> 33:30.976
Well...

33:31.079 --> 33:33.138
We've received
a number of letters

33:34.549 --> 33:38.246
denigrating you
and urging us not to...

33:38.319 --> 33:39.979
Not to grant you tenure.

33:42.823 --> 33:43.790
From who?

33:43.890 --> 33:47.416
Well, they're anonymous,
so we dismiss them completely.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.894
Well, what do they say?

33:50.296 --> 33:52.491
Well, they
make allegations...

33:52.598 --> 33:54.622
Well, allegations...
Assertions.

33:54.733 --> 33:58.601
And though we give them
no credence at all, Larry.

33:59.437 --> 34:00.926
Well, I'm not really
at liberty

34:01.005 --> 34:03.599
to discuss the specifics of
the committee's deliberations.

34:03.674 --> 34:07.405
But I think you're saying these won't
play any part in your deliberations?

34:07.478 --> 34:08.774
None whatsoever.

34:08.844 --> 34:09.812
So what are they?

34:09.911 --> 34:12.745
Moral turpitude,
you could say.

34:14.250 --> 34:16.911
Uh-huh. Can I ask? Are they...

34:18.020 --> 34:20.011
- Are they idiomatic?
- Hmm?

34:20.121 --> 34:23.920
The reason I ask, I have a
Korean student. South Korean.

34:24.025 --> 34:27.859
A disgruntled South Korean, and I
meant to talk to you about this...

34:27.962 --> 34:33.126
Oh, no, no They're competently,
even eloquently written.

34:33.199 --> 34:36.793
A native English speaker.
There's no question about that.

34:36.870 --> 34:39.268
- Uh-huh.
- Let me reiterate.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.804
No cause for concern.

34:40.873 --> 34:45.706
I only speak because I
would feel odd concealing it.

34:45.810 --> 34:47.437
- Yes.
- Yeah.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.538
Best to Judith.

34:57.888 --> 34:59.719
I got to get
my radio back.

34:59.823 --> 35:02.017
Maybe the fucker lodged
it up his fucking asshole.

35:02.124 --> 35:05.457
I got to get it back, or Mike Fable’s
going to pound the crap out of me.

35:05.561 --> 35:06.994
Way up his asshole.

35:21.241 --> 35:22.400
Good afternoon.

35:26.479 --> 35:27.468
Go scrub up, Mitch.

35:29.582 --> 35:30.673
Been hunting?

35:37.254 --> 35:38.687
Is that a...

35:38.756 --> 35:40.189
It's going to be
a boat shed.

35:40.257 --> 35:41.554
Uh-huh.

35:41.659 --> 35:42.648
That's great.

35:44.261 --> 35:46.694
- Mr. Brandt...
- I said scrub up, Mitch!

35:51.601 --> 35:53.033
Isn't this a school day?

35:53.102 --> 35:55.161
I took him out of school today
so he could hunt with his dad.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.270
Uh, Mr Brandt,

36:00.375 --> 36:02.343
that's just about at
the property line there.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.775
I don't think
we're supposed to get

36:03.878 --> 36:05.505
...within, what, 10 feet...
- Property line's the poplar.

36:07.781 --> 36:09.009
- The...
- Poplar.

36:09.683 --> 36:12.345
- Well, even if it is, you're just
about over it. - Measure.

36:12.452 --> 36:15.420
- I don't have to measure, you
can tell it's... - Line's the poplar.

36:16.856 --> 36:17.914
What's going on?

36:18.357 --> 36:19.381
Nothing.

36:22.127 --> 36:23.890
- Larry?
- Yeah?

36:23.962 --> 36:25.554
Did you go to
Sieglestein Schultz?

36:25.630 --> 36:26.722
No, I... Not yet.

36:26.798 --> 36:27.856
Larry.

36:27.932 --> 36:29.193
Appointment Monday.

36:29.266 --> 36:30.563
Where are you going?

36:30.634 --> 36:31.896
I'm going to the Hole.

36:31.969 --> 36:33.561
What? At 5:00?

36:33.637 --> 36:36.128
We're stopping at Laurie Kipper stein’s
house so I can wash my hair.

36:36.739 --> 36:37.763
Hi, Mr Gopnik.

36:38.141 --> 36:40.302
- You can't wash it here?
- Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.

36:40.410 --> 36:41.968
I'll be out in a minute!

36:42.078 --> 36:43.136
- Are you ready?
- Huh?

36:43.246 --> 36:44.735
- We're meeting Sy at Embers.
- I am?

36:44.813 --> 36:47.145
Both of us.
I told you, Larry.

36:49.151 --> 36:50.379
Larry.

36:54.755 --> 36:55.813
How are you?

36:57.625 --> 36:58.648
Sy.

37:01.227 --> 37:02.251
Hello, Judith.

37:02.328 --> 37:03.317
Hello, Sy.

37:05.565 --> 37:08.795
Larry, I want to
thank you for coming.

37:09.101 --> 37:12.628
It's so important that we be
able to discuss these things.

37:12.738 --> 37:14.432
I'm happy to come
to Embers, Sy.

37:14.505 --> 37:16.996
But I'm thinking, really,
maybe it's best to leave

37:17.108 --> 37:18.439
these discussions
to the lawyers.

37:18.509 --> 37:21.341
Of course Legal matters,
you let the lawyers discuss.

37:21.445 --> 37:23.436
You don't mix
apples and oranges.

37:23.513 --> 37:24.946
I have begged you
to see the lawyer.

37:25.015 --> 37:26.277
I told you,
I'm going Monday.

37:26.349 --> 37:29.010
Monday is timely.
This is not...

37:29.118 --> 37:32.781
Please, Embers is not the forum
for legalities You're so right.

37:34.023 --> 37:37.514
No, Judith and I wanted
merely to discuss, uh,

37:38.359 --> 37:40.793
practicalities.
Living arrangements.

37:41.162 --> 37:44.961
After all, this is an issue
where no one is at odds.

37:45.032 --> 37:46.192
Living arrangements?

37:47.367 --> 37:50.597
I think we all agree
that the children

37:50.670 --> 37:53.764
not being contaminated
with the tension,

37:53.840 --> 37:54.966
the most important.

37:55.041 --> 37:57.032
We shouldn't put the kids
in the middle of this, Larry.

37:57.143 --> 37:58.166
The kids aren't...

37:58.276 --> 38:00.176
I'm saying "we. "
I'm not pointing fingers.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.974
No one is playing
the blame game, Larry.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.140
I didn't say
anyone was.

38:04.216 --> 38:06.183
Well, let's not play "He
Said, She Said," either.

38:06.317 --> 38:08.308
- I wasn't! I...
- All right. Look, look, look.

38:08.385 --> 38:12.151
Let's just take a step back and
we can diffuse the situation.

38:14.324 --> 38:17.851
You know, Larry,
sometimes I find that

38:17.961 --> 38:19.622
if I count to 10...

38:21.563 --> 38:22.621
One,

38:23.899 --> 38:24.888
two,

38:26.401 --> 38:27.459
three,

38:28.903 --> 38:30.131
four...

38:30.538 --> 38:32.403
Or silently.

38:39.846 --> 38:42.507
Really, to keep things
on an even keel

38:42.581 --> 38:44.481
leading up to
Danny's bar mitzvah...

38:44.550 --> 38:46.347
A child's
bar mitzvah, Larry.

38:46.418 --> 38:50.148
Sy and I think it's best if
you move out of the house.

38:51.489 --> 38:52.478
Move out?

38:52.590 --> 38:55.024
- Well, it makes eminent sense.
- Things can't continue as they...

38:55.093 --> 38:56.560
Move out?
Where would I go?

38:56.661 --> 38:59.720
Well, for instance, the
Jolly Roger is quite liveable.

38:59.830 --> 39:01.092
It's not expensive.

39:01.198 --> 39:03.758
The rooms are
eminently habitable.

39:03.867 --> 39:05.356
This would allow you
to visit the kids.

39:05.434 --> 39:07.527
There's convenience in its
favour They've got a pool.

39:07.603 --> 39:10.265
Wouldn't it make more sense
for you to move in with Sy?

39:12.240 --> 39:13.332
Larry.

39:13.742 --> 39:16.870
Larry, you...
You are jesting.

39:17.913 --> 39:20.710
I think, really,
the Jolly Roger

39:20.781 --> 39:23.841
is the appropriate
course of action.

39:29.289 --> 39:30.381
Listen here,

39:30.456 --> 39:32.117
you little fucker,
I want my money!

39:32.258 --> 39:33.520
Stop it!
I'm going to get it!

39:33.526 --> 39:34.549
Give it back!

39:34.626 --> 39:36.253
You owe me 20 bucks,
you little shit!

39:36.361 --> 39:38.295
- Don't worry about it!
- Give it, brat fucker!

39:38.430 --> 39:40.898
- I'm going to get it! I'm going to get it!
- Brat! Fucker!

39:40.966 --> 39:42.626
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

39:44.969 --> 39:47.028
- What was that?
- Nothing.

39:48.272 --> 39:49.761
How's the Torah
portion coming?

39:49.873 --> 39:52.239
Can you maybe
use the hi-fi?

39:52.309 --> 39:53.571
- What?
- Can I borrow this?

39:53.643 --> 39:57.544
I'm taking some stuff to,
you know, the Jolly Roger.

39:57.613 --> 39:58.739
- Dad!
- Sure, Dad.

39:58.814 --> 40:00.805
Dad! Chinese guy!

40:01.283 --> 40:02.375
Culture clash.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.279
Culture clash.

40:07.422 --> 40:10.391
With all respect, Mr. Park,
I don't think it's that.

40:10.458 --> 40:11.754
- Yes.
- No,

40:11.825 --> 40:15.420
it would be a culture clash if
it were the custom in your land

40:15.495 --> 40:16.928
to bribe people
for grades.

40:16.997 --> 40:18.123
Yes.

40:19.665 --> 40:21.826
So, you're saying
it is the custom?

40:21.934 --> 40:25.233
No, this is defamation.
Ground for lawsuit.

40:25.838 --> 40:26.929
Let me get this straight.

40:27.005 --> 40:29.599
You're threatening to sue
me for defaming your son?

40:29.674 --> 40:30.800
Yes.

40:31.443 --> 40:33.673
- But it would...
- Is this man bothering you?

40:34.912 --> 40:37.642
Is he bothering me? No.

40:39.617 --> 40:40.845
I, uh...

40:47.190 --> 40:48.521
See, look...

40:48.624 --> 40:50.285
If it were defamation,
there would have to be

40:50.359 --> 40:52.452
someone I was defaming him to, or I...

40:52.527 --> 40:54.586
All right,
let's keep it simple.

40:54.663 --> 40:58.098
I could pretend the money never
appeared That's not defaming anyone.

40:58.165 --> 41:00.531
Yes. And passing grade.

41:01.202 --> 41:02.829
- Passing grade?
- Yes.

41:03.837 --> 41:05.429
Or you'll sue me?

41:05.505 --> 41:06.631
For taking money.

41:06.706 --> 41:08.469
So he did leave the money?

41:08.541 --> 41:09.803
This is defamation!

41:11.043 --> 41:14.137
It doesn't make sense. Either
he left the money or he didn't.

41:14.213 --> 41:16.545
Please.
Accept the mystery.

41:19.951 --> 41:21.714
Give me that, fucker.

41:29.026 --> 41:30.288
He's very
good with numbers.

41:30.360 --> 41:33.726
I think his social skills
have held him back.

41:33.829 --> 41:35.820
Such a sweet man, though.

41:35.898 --> 41:37.195
Arthur has
a good heart.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.699
And he never complains,
unlike me.

41:41.736 --> 41:43.670
Sometimes I don't
give him enough credit.

41:43.738 --> 41:47.504
He tried to tell me about this
thing he's working on, this...

41:47.575 --> 41:49.405
The Meticulous.

41:50.244 --> 41:55.738
He says it's a probability
map of the universe.

41:56.749 --> 41:59.081
Does he go out
socially at all?

41:59.719 --> 42:03.176
He tries. He's been going to the
singles mixers at Hillel House.

42:05.424 --> 42:07.722
I should talk.
I'm not doing any better.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.355
How is Judith?

42:12.530 --> 42:15.192
Fine. She's fine.

42:17.068 --> 42:20.036
Sometimes these things
just aren't meant to be.

42:20.103 --> 42:24.005
And it can take a while before
you feel what was always there.

42:24.074 --> 42:26.439
- For better or worse.
- I never felt it!

42:27.443 --> 42:29.741
It was a bolt
from the blue.

42:29.845 --> 42:31.039
What does that mean?

42:31.113 --> 42:34.878
Everything that I thought was
one way turns out to be another.

42:35.917 --> 42:40.580
Then, it's an opportunity to
learn how things really are.

42:41.955 --> 42:43.354
I don't mean to sound glib.

42:45.759 --> 42:49.455
It's not always easy deciphering
what God is trying to tell you,

42:50.029 --> 42:53.192
but it's not something you have
to figure out all by yourself.

42:54.699 --> 42:55.961
We're Jews.

42:56.434 --> 43:00.370
We've got that well of tradition
to draw on, to help us understand.

43:01.039 --> 43:03.734
When we're puzzled,
we have all the stories

43:03.807 --> 43:07.538
that have been handed down from
people who had the same problems.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.570
Have you talked to
Rabbi Nachtner?

43:15.318 --> 43:16.285
Why not see him?

43:16.385 --> 43:18.045
What's the Rabbi
going to tell me?

43:18.453 --> 43:20.148
If I knew,
I'd be the Rabbi.

43:20.489 --> 43:24.220
The air out here is magnificent.

43:25.659 --> 43:29.823
I'm telling you, if someone
could bottle this air,

43:29.930 --> 43:31.726
they'd make
a million dollars.

43:48.513 --> 43:50.413
Hello, Larry.
Good to see you.

43:50.481 --> 43:51.846
Oh. Rabbi Scott.

43:53.184 --> 43:55.310
I thought I was going
to see Rabbi Nachtner.

43:55.418 --> 43:57.511
He was called away
on an etz monim.

43:57.621 --> 44:01.318
Ruth Bryn’s mother is in the
hospital and she isn't doing well.

44:01.423 --> 44:04.688
Rabbi Nachtner asked me to
cover for him. Come on in.

44:16.370 --> 44:19.771
And she wants a get.

44:24.777 --> 44:25.869
A what?

44:28.548 --> 44:30.345
- She wants a...
- Oh, a get.

44:30.449 --> 44:32.006
Uh-huh. Sure.

44:32.784 --> 44:35.480
I feel like the carpet's
been yanked out from under me.

44:35.554 --> 44:37.818
I don't know which end is up.

44:37.889 --> 44:39.685
I'm not even sure
how to react.

44:39.790 --> 44:41.121
I'm too confused.

44:41.559 --> 44:45.222
What reasons did she
give for the rupture?

44:45.329 --> 44:47.888
She didn't give reasons
Just that,

44:47.997 --> 44:50.227
you know, things
haven't been going well.

44:50.333 --> 44:51.391
And is that true?

44:52.068 --> 44:53.557
I guess.
I don't know.

44:53.669 --> 44:55.830
She's usually right
about these things.

44:55.904 --> 44:58.372
I was hoping that
Rabbi Nachtner could...

44:58.874 --> 45:00.898
That he would...
He would... Yes?

45:01.008 --> 45:03.238
Well, with the benefit
of his life experience.

45:04.011 --> 45:05.171
No offense.

45:05.246 --> 45:08.408
No, of course not I am the junior rabbi.

45:09.082 --> 45:12.848
And it's true, the point of
view of somebody who's older

45:12.919 --> 45:17.355
and perhaps had similar
problems might be more valid.

45:17.423 --> 45:20.483
And you should see the senior
rabbi as well, by all means.

45:20.559 --> 45:21.753
Or even Marshal,

45:22.261 --> 45:24.023
if you can get in.

45:24.095 --> 45:26.689
He's quite busy,
but maybe...

45:31.034 --> 45:32.558
Can I share
something with you?

45:32.936 --> 45:35.837
Because I, too, have had
the feeling of losing track

45:35.906 --> 45:38.703
of Hashem,
which is the problem here.

45:39.242 --> 45:42.040
I, too, have forgotten
how to see him in the world,

45:42.111 --> 45:44.170
and when that happens,
you think,

45:44.247 --> 45:48.239
"Well, if I can't see him,
he isn't there. He's gone. "

45:48.516 --> 45:50.108
But that's not the case.

45:50.619 --> 45:53.610
You just need to
remember how to see him.

45:53.721 --> 45:56.019
Am I right? I mean...

45:57.124 --> 45:59.115
The parking lot here.

46:02.128 --> 46:03.561
Not much to see.

46:04.197 --> 46:06.893
But if you imagine
yourself a visitor,

46:07.733 --> 46:11.635
somebody who isn't familiar
with these autos and such,

46:11.737 --> 46:14.297
somebody still with
the capacity for wonder.

46:14.406 --> 46:17.568
Someone with
a fresh perspective.

46:18.142 --> 46:19.439
That's what it is, Larry.

46:19.543 --> 46:21.568
Because with
the right perspective,

46:21.646 --> 46:25.103
you can see Hashem, you
know, reaching into the world.

46:25.215 --> 46:27.945
He is in the world,
not just in shul.

46:28.652 --> 46:33.554
It sounds to me like you're looking
at the world, looking at your wife,

46:33.622 --> 46:35.556
through tired eyes.

46:36.225 --> 46:39.819
It sounds like she's
become a sort of thing...

46:40.561 --> 46:42.085
A problem.

46:42.630 --> 46:43.756
A thing.

46:43.831 --> 46:45.957
She is seeing Sy Able man.

46:50.771 --> 46:52.601
- Oh.
- They're planning...

46:52.672 --> 46:54.139
That's why
they want the get.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.470
Oh I'm sorry.

46:56.575 --> 46:58.099
It was his idea.

46:58.177 --> 47:03.614
Well, they do need a get
to remarry in the faith.

47:04.849 --> 47:07.840
But... This is life.

47:08.852 --> 47:12.686
You have to see these things
as expressions of God's will.

47:12.790 --> 47:14.689
You don't have to
like it, of course.

47:15.124 --> 47:17.456
The boss isn't always right,
but he's always the boss.

47:17.527 --> 47:19.324
That's right!

47:19.929 --> 47:21.157
Things aren't so bad.

47:21.264 --> 47:23.527
Look at
the parking lot, Larry.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.430
Just look at
that parking lot.

47:43.483 --> 47:44.710
Are we eating already?

47:44.817 --> 47:46.216
Sarah's going out.

47:46.885 --> 47:48.182
Ow! Cut it out!

47:48.287 --> 47:49.515
What's going on?

47:55.827 --> 47:56.816
Isn't Dad eating?

47:56.894 --> 47:58.225
He's at the Jolly Roger.

47:59.296 --> 48:00.524
Oh, yeah.

48:05.902 --> 48:06.993
How are you, Larry?

48:07.069 --> 48:09.560
Jesus, I am so sorry

48:09.705 --> 48:12.196
- to be seeing you under these
circumstances. - Oh, well...

48:12.308 --> 48:14.867
I always thought you
and Judy were rock solid.

48:14.976 --> 48:18.207
This is so terrible, Larry.
This is devastating.

48:18.313 --> 48:19.678
Well, you know,
the way I look at it,

48:19.748 --> 48:23.308
it's an opportunity for me to
really sit down and figure things out

48:23.384 --> 48:27.650
and look at the world afresh
instead of just, you know,

48:27.721 --> 48:31.656
settling for the routine, tired
old way of looking at things.

48:33.426 --> 48:34.552
Really?

48:35.861 --> 48:37.328
I don't know,
maybe not.

48:38.997 --> 48:42.330
Well, legally,
I have to warn you,

48:42.401 --> 48:44.868
it's never easy
for the husband.

48:44.935 --> 48:47.768
Unless, of course,
there's some question

48:47.872 --> 48:52.103
of the wife having violated
the marriage contract?

48:52.208 --> 48:54.233
Oh, no, no
Nothing like that.

48:54.344 --> 48:56.904
Although she is planning to
marry Sy Able man, but they...

48:57.013 --> 48:58.377
Sy Able man!

48:59.448 --> 49:02.542
- Yes. But they...
- Esther is barely cold!

49:03.352 --> 49:04.683
She passed
three years ago.

49:04.753 --> 49:08.950
Well... Still, this changes
the complexion, Larry.

49:09.424 --> 49:10.789
Sy Able man.

49:10.892 --> 49:13.689
Not in the sense that... T
here hasn't been hanky-panky.

49:13.760 --> 49:14.852
To my knowledge.

49:14.961 --> 49:18.226
- Oh? - No I'm fairly
certain this is not an issue.

49:18.298 --> 49:21.460
And in fact,
Judith wants a get.

49:24.036 --> 49:25.128
A what?

49:26.305 --> 49:27.794
A ritual divorce.

49:27.906 --> 49:30.033
- Oh.
- So that they can remarry in the faith.

49:30.108 --> 49:32.372
Uh-huh.
Yeah, sure, uh...

49:32.444 --> 49:34.469
Well, not really
a legal issue.

49:36.380 --> 49:37.642
Okay, um...

49:38.715 --> 49:40.580
Good. Good.

49:41.385 --> 49:43.079
Well...

49:43.152 --> 49:46.588
On the other thing, the
neighbour’s property line,

49:46.656 --> 49:49.284
I've asked Solomon
Schultz to take a look.

49:49.392 --> 49:52.758
There's very little to do with
real estate that'll get by Sol.

49:52.828 --> 49:54.591
Okay Good
How do you...

49:54.663 --> 49:56.153
I guess
I'm a little worried.

49:56.264 --> 49:58.424
How do you...
I have money pressures...

49:58.499 --> 50:00.592
Our fee structure?
We bill by the hour.

50:00.668 --> 50:03.933
Dave Sieglestein and
Solomon Schultz bill at 110.

50:04.004 --> 50:06.836
The associates, me,
for instance, bill at...

50:06.940 --> 50:09.408
Call for Mr Gopnik
Danny at home.

50:09.476 --> 50:11.501
You can take it here.

50:13.679 --> 50:14.805
SECRETARY:

50:16.748 --> 50:17.737
Danny?

50:17.816 --> 50:19.443
- Hey, Dad.
- Are you all right?

50:19.518 --> 50:20.506
Are you all...

50:20.618 --> 50:21.983
F Troop is fuzzy.

50:23.855 --> 50:25.117
What?

50:25.189 --> 50:26.952
F Troop is still fuzzy.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.691
- Dad?
- Is everything okay?

51:58.436 --> 51:59.425
Clive?

52:02.707 --> 52:03.695
Clive!

52:05.576 --> 52:08.374
You little bastard! You
going to send your mother next?

52:10.447 --> 52:12.277
Little bastard!
I want to see you!

52:21.122 --> 52:22.111
Hold on.

52:22.524 --> 52:24.583
Professor Gopnik,
it's Dick Dutton again.

52:25.393 --> 52:26.450
Dick Dutton.

52:28.529 --> 52:29.553
Hello?

52:29.630 --> 52:31.188
Hello, Mr Gopnik?

52:31.265 --> 52:33.960
This is Dick Dutton from
the Columbia Record Club.

52:34.067 --> 52:37.093
I'm calling because
it's now four months,

52:37.203 --> 52:39.569
and we have yet to
receive your first payment.

52:42.074 --> 52:43.564
There's some mistake.

52:43.642 --> 52:45.974
I'm not a member
of the Columbian Record Club.

52:46.078 --> 52:49.774
Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik
of 8419 Fern Hill Road?

52:49.880 --> 52:51.575
No, I live
at the Jolly Roger.

52:51.649 --> 52:52.741
Excuse me?

52:53.417 --> 52:54.714
No, I...

52:55.619 --> 52:57.780
Well, yes, okay.

52:57.887 --> 52:59.787
- Yes, you are Lawrence Gopnik?
- Okay.

53:00.490 --> 53:01.548
"Okay" means...

53:01.625 --> 53:03.888
Okay, yes,
Lawrence Gopnik, yes.

53:03.959 --> 53:06.928
Okay, well, you received
your 12 introductory albums,

53:06.996 --> 53:10.556
and you've been receiving the monthly
main selection for four months now...

53:10.632 --> 53:12.259
The monthly main selection?
Is that a record?

53:12.333 --> 53:14.096
I didn't ask
for any records.

53:14.168 --> 53:17.331
To receive the monthly main
selection, you do nothing. You...

53:18.190 --> 53:19.748
That's right.
I haven't done anything.

53:19.859 --> 53:22.521
Yes, that's why you received
the monthly main selection.

53:22.661 --> 53:27.359
- But...
- The last one was Santana Abraxas. You...

53:27.432 --> 53:30.890
I didn't ask
for Santana Abraxas.

53:31.002 --> 53:33.094
You request
the main selection

53:33.203 --> 53:35.694
at the retail price
by doing nothing.

53:35.773 --> 53:37.707
It's automatically
mailed to you,

53:37.775 --> 53:39.265
plus shipping
and handling.

53:39.410 --> 53:42.207
- You're about to receive...
- I can't afford a new record every month!

53:42.278 --> 53:43.677
I haven't asked...

53:43.746 --> 53:46.715
You're about to get
Cosmo's Factory, sir.

53:46.783 --> 53:48.374
The June
main selection.

53:48.450 --> 53:50.918
Look, look,
something is very wrong!

53:51.019 --> 53:53.214
I don't want
Santana Abraxas.

53:53.288 --> 53:55.448
I've just been
in a terrible auto accident.

53:59.627 --> 54:00.787
I'm sorry, sir.

54:02.695 --> 54:06.062
Well, thank you.
But I...

54:06.966 --> 54:07.955
Are you okay?

54:10.102 --> 54:13.071
Yes, yes.
No one was hurt.

54:14.306 --> 54:16.797
Okay. Good.

54:18.109 --> 54:22.239
Well, you had 14 days to
listen to Santana Abraxas.

54:22.313 --> 54:23.371
- Sir?
- Look...

54:23.448 --> 54:26.143
I didn't ask for Santana Abraxas,

54:26.249 --> 54:29.741
I didn't listen
to Santana Abraxas,

54:29.820 --> 54:31.754
I didn't do anything!

54:31.822 --> 54:33.755
- Sir! Your son.
- Mr. Gopnik...

54:33.823 --> 54:35.256
He says it's urgent.

54:35.324 --> 54:36.621
We can't make you
listen to the record...

54:36.725 --> 54:38.386
- Okay, okay, okay...
- We provide...

54:38.461 --> 54:39.927
Okay, I have to
call you back.

54:39.994 --> 54:41.757
- This is... I'm sorry.
- No, no, Mr. Gopnik, please...

54:41.830 --> 54:43.388
- Danny?
- Yeah. Listen, Dad...

54:43.465 --> 54:45.160
Did you join
the Columbia Record Club?

54:47.668 --> 54:48.828
- Danny?
- Um...

54:48.936 --> 54:52.167
Danny, this is completely
unacceptable. I can't afford to...

54:52.272 --> 54:53.967
Okay, Dad, but you
got to come home.

54:55.475 --> 54:56.737
Is it F Troop?

54:56.809 --> 54:58.743
No, Mom's real upset.

55:10.821 --> 55:11.788
Dad?

55:11.856 --> 55:12.948
Yes?

55:13.023 --> 55:14.991
Does this mean I can't
go to the Hole tonight?

55:15.092 --> 55:16.991
Does what mean?
What happened?

55:17.093 --> 55:19.425
Oh, Sy Able man,
he died in a car crash.

55:19.496 --> 55:20.520
Hey, Dad.

55:20.964 --> 55:21.988
What?

55:22.098 --> 55:23.497
So you're coming back home?

55:24.500 --> 55:25.626
Can you fix
the aerial?

55:25.701 --> 55:26.759
What?

55:26.835 --> 55:28.962
It's still,
you know...

56:02.900 --> 56:05.528
She seems to be
asking an awful lot.

56:07.337 --> 56:09.304
But then...
I don't know.

56:09.739 --> 56:11.900
Somebody has to pay
for Sy's funeral.

56:12.875 --> 56:13.842
Uh-huh.

56:13.910 --> 56:15.343
His own estate
is in probate,

56:15.411 --> 56:17.241
but why does it
have to be me?

56:17.345 --> 56:19.472
Or is it wrong
to complain?

56:19.881 --> 56:21.246
Judy says it is.

56:21.883 --> 56:23.850
But I'm so strapped
for cash right now,

56:23.918 --> 56:26.853
carrying the mortgage, and
paying for the Jolly Roger,

56:26.921 --> 56:30.357
and I wrecked the car, and
Danny's bar mitzvah coming up, I...

56:30.424 --> 56:33.256
Something like this,
there's never a good time.

56:33.927 --> 56:36.691
I don't know
where it all leaves me.

56:36.763 --> 56:37.889
Sy's death.

56:39.364 --> 56:42.390
Obviously, it's not going
to go back like it was.

56:42.501 --> 56:43.433
Mmm.

56:43.569 --> 56:45.502
- Would you even want that, Larry?
- No, I...

56:45.570 --> 56:49.006
Well, yeah.
Sometimes.

56:49.707 --> 56:50.696
Or...

56:51.576 --> 56:53.406
I don't know.
I guess

56:54.044 --> 56:56.512
the honest answer is,
I don't know.

56:56.580 --> 57:00.016
What was my life before?
Not what I thought it was.

57:00.950 --> 57:02.212
So what does it all mean?

57:02.284 --> 57:04.616
What is Hashem
trying to tell me,

57:04.720 --> 57:07.052
making me pay for
Sy Able man’s funeral?

57:07.122 --> 57:08.383
- Mmm.
- And did I tell you

57:08.456 --> 57:11.391
I had a car accident
the same time Sy had his?

57:11.459 --> 57:13.757
- The same instant, for all I know.
- Mmm.

57:13.861 --> 57:17.591
Is Hashem trying to tell
me that Sy Able man is me?

57:18.065 --> 57:20.590
Or that we are all one
or something?

57:22.069 --> 57:23.695
How does God speak to us?

57:24.870 --> 57:25.962
It's a good question.

57:26.973 --> 57:28.099
You know Lee Suss man.

57:28.874 --> 57:30.898
Dr Suss man?
I think I... Yeah.

57:31.543 --> 57:33.977
Did he ever tell you
about the goy's teeth?

57:34.613 --> 57:36.638
No Uh, what goy?

57:36.748 --> 57:39.875
So, Lee is at work one day.

57:40.317 --> 57:43.445
You know, he has the orthodontic
practice there at Great Bear.

57:45.221 --> 57:46.586
He's making a plaster mold.

57:46.656 --> 57:50.251
It's for corrective bridgework in
the mouth of one of his patents,

57:50.326 --> 57:51.816
Russell Krauss.

58:03.638 --> 58:05.902
The mold dries, and Lee
is examining it one day

58:05.973 --> 58:08.338
before fabricating
an appliance.

58:08.441 --> 58:10.136
He notices
something unusual.

58:13.446 --> 58:16.243
There appears to be
something engraved

58:16.315 --> 58:19.182
on the inside of the
patent’s lower incisors.

58:27.191 --> 58:30.648
Hey vav shin yud ayin nun yud.

58:32.362 --> 58:34.296
Ho-she-ay-ni.

58:34.364 --> 58:36.695
"Help me. Save me. "

58:36.999 --> 58:39.194
This, in a goy's mouth, Larry.

58:46.274 --> 58:47.935
He calls the goy back

58:48.009 --> 58:51.308
on the pretence of needling additional
measurements for the appliance.

58:51.679 --> 58:52.873
"How are you?

58:54.014 --> 58:55.982
"Noticed any other
problems with your teeth?"

58:58.152 --> 58:59.140
"No. "

59:06.892 --> 59:08.120
There it is.

59:08.727 --> 59:10.285
Ho-she-ay-ni.

59:10.362 --> 59:11.351
"Help me. "

59:12.364 --> 59:13.353
Son of a gun.

59:16.701 --> 59:18.066
Suss man goes home.

59:18.969 --> 59:20.732
Can Suss man eat?
Suss man can't eat.

59:21.638 --> 59:24.072
Can Suss man sleep?
Suss man can't sleep.

59:30.245 --> 59:32.713
Suss man looks at the molds
of his other patents,

59:32.815 --> 59:34.077
goy and Jew alike,

59:34.183 --> 59:36.241
seeking other messages.
He finds none.

59:37.185 --> 59:38.846
He looks In his own mouth.

59:39.487 --> 59:40.511
Nothing.

59:41.422 --> 59:43.322
He looks
in his wife's mouth.

59:48.862 --> 59:49.988
Nothing.

59:50.863 --> 59:53.024
But Suss man
is an educated man.

59:53.432 --> 59:55.093
Not the world's
greatest sage, maybe.

59:55.201 --> 59:56.429
No Rabbi Marshak.

59:56.769 --> 59:59.760
But he knows a thing or two
about the Zohar and the Kabbalah.

59:59.871 --> 01:00:03.238
He knows that every Hebrew
letter has its numeric equivalent.

01:00:03.341 --> 01:00:06.207
8- 4-5-4-4-7-3

01:00:06.276 --> 01:00:08.608
Seven digits.
A phone number, maybe?

01:00:10.748 --> 01:00:14.342
"Hello? Do you know a goy
named Krauss, Russell Krauss?"

01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:15.441
"Who?"

01:00:15.551 --> 01:00:16.745
"Where have I called?

01:00:17.453 --> 01:00:20.445
"The Red Owl in Bloomington?
Thanks so much. "

01:00:25.127 --> 01:00:26.287
He goes.

01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:32.021
It's a Red Owl
Groceries, what have you.

01:00:35.102 --> 01:00:38.036
Suss man goes home
What does it mean?

01:00:38.471 --> 01:00:41.440
He has to find out if he
is ever to sleep again.

01:00:42.142 --> 01:00:43.472
He goes to see

01:00:45.144 --> 01:00:46.236
the Rabbi Nachtner.

01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:49.212
He comes In, he sits right
where you're sitting, right now.

01:00:49.915 --> 01:00:51.279
"What does it mean, Rabbi?

01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:54.951
"Is it a sign from Hashem? 'Help me'.

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:57.611
"I, Suss man, should be doing
something to help this guy.

01:00:57.721 --> 01:00:59.814
"Doing what?
The teeth don't say.

01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:03.552
"Or maybe I'm supposed to help people
generally lead a more righteous life?

01:01:04.728 --> 01:01:07.252
"Is the answer
in Kabbalah? In Torah?

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:09.995
"Or is there even a question?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.491
"Tell me, Rabbi,
what can such a sign

01:01:14.836 --> 01:01:16.064
mean?"

01:01:24.144 --> 01:01:25.475
So? What did
you tell him?

01:01:27.014 --> 01:01:28.002
Suss man?

01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:29.509
Yes.

01:01:29.615 --> 01:01:31.776
Is it relevant?

01:01:31.851 --> 01:01:33.341
Well, isn't that why
you're telling me?

01:01:34.287 --> 01:01:35.344
Okay.

01:01:36.521 --> 01:01:38.113
Nachtner says, "Look.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:39.953
"The teeth, we don't know

01:01:40.025 --> 01:01:42.288
"A sign from Hashem?
Don't know.

01:01:42.693 --> 01:01:43.682
"Helping others?

01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:46.189
"Couldn't hurt. "

01:01:50.033 --> 01:01:52.695
No, no,
but who put it there?

01:01:52.802 --> 01:01:56.931
Was it for him, Suss man? Or for whoever
found it? Or for just... For, for...

01:01:57.005 --> 01:01:58.267
We can't know everything.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.103
It sounds like you don't know anything!

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:01.540
Why even tell me the story?

01:02:01.877 --> 01:02:04.367
First I should tell you,
then I shouldn't.

01:02:07.315 --> 01:02:08.612
What happened to Suss man?

01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:11.007
What would happen?
Not much.

01:02:11.118 --> 01:02:12.209
He went back to work.

01:02:12.786 --> 01:02:15.550
For a while, he checked every
patent’s teeth for new messages.

01:02:15.655 --> 01:02:16.815
He didn’t find any.

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:18.881
In time, he found
he stopped checking.

01:02:20.659 --> 01:02:22.149
He returned to life.

01:02:27.198 --> 01:02:29.564
These questions that are
bothering you, Larry,

01:02:30.735 --> 01:02:32.225
maybe they're
like a toothache.

01:02:33.538 --> 01:02:36.028
Feel them for a while,
then they go away.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.134
I don't want it to just
go away! I want an answer!

01:02:39.209 --> 01:02:41.074
Sure We all
want the answer.

01:02:42.078 --> 01:02:43.909
Hashem doesn't owe us
the answer, Larry.

01:02:44.413 --> 01:02:46.176
Hashem doesn't
owe us anything.

01:02:46.249 --> 01:02:48.240
The obligation
runs the other way.

01:02:48.818 --> 01:02:51.183
Why does he make us
feel the questions

01:02:51.253 --> 01:02:53.653
if he's not going to
give us any answers?

01:02:55.924 --> 01:02:57.185
He hasn't told me.

01:03:02.563 --> 01:03:05.588
And what happened
to the goy?

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:07.021
The goy?

01:03:08.935 --> 01:03:09.924
Who cares?

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.837
Sy Able man
was a serious man.

01:03:15.274 --> 01:03:18.936
Sy Able man was a man
devoted to his community.

01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:23.068
To Torah study To his
beloved wife, Esther,

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:26.410
until three years ago
she passed,

01:03:26.516 --> 01:03:29.076
and to his duty,
as he saw it.

01:03:30.921 --> 01:03:32.582
Where does such a man go?

01:03:33.522 --> 01:03:37.959
A trade. Who knows,
maybe even a lamed vavnik.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.052
A man beloved by all.

01:03:40.129 --> 01:03:42.528
A man who despised
the frivolous.

01:03:42.597 --> 01:03:45.930
Could such
a serious man simply

01:03:47.135 --> 01:03:48.124
disappear?

01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:52.630
We speak of olam ha-ba,
the world to come.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.229
Not heaven.

01:03:55.475 --> 01:03:58.238
Not what the gentiles
think of as afterlife.

01:03:58.311 --> 01:04:01.747
"Olam ha-ba. "
What is olam ha-ba?

01:04:03.281 --> 01:04:06.409
Where is olam ha-ba?

01:04:07.919 --> 01:04:12.218
Well, it is not a
geographic place, certainly.

01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:14.883
Like Canada.

01:04:15.626 --> 01:04:18.560
Nor is it the
Eretz zavat chalav udvash,

01:04:18.628 --> 01:04:20.289
the land flowing
with milk and honey.

01:04:20.396 --> 01:04:23.490
For we are not promised
a personal reward.

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:25.665
A gold star.

01:04:26.768 --> 01:04:30.329
A first-class VIP lounge where we
get milk and cookies to eternity.

01:04:31.974 --> 01:04:35.773
Olam ha-ba is
in the bosom of Abraham.

01:04:40.914 --> 01:04:42.074
Arthur Gopnik?

01:04:43.783 --> 01:04:45.273
Are you
Arthur Gopnik?

01:04:46.686 --> 01:04:48.676
I'm Lawrence Gopnik.

01:04:48.787 --> 01:04:50.687
Do you go by the name
Arthur Gopnik?

01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:52.256
No.

01:04:52.324 --> 01:04:53.621
Is that Arthur Gopnik?

01:04:57.662 --> 01:05:00.426
Can you tell me what's going
on? We're sitting shiva here.

01:05:00.498 --> 01:05:01.590
You're what?

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:04.129
A religious observance.

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:06.294
We're bereaved.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:07.630
Who died?

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:09.194
My wife's, uh...

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.134
It's a long story.

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:17.009
Look, you tell Gopnik, Arthur
Gopnik, he's breaking the law.

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:19.478
We're not arresting him
now, but next time we will.

01:05:19.547 --> 01:05:22.482
Gambling's against the law in this
state That's just the way it is.

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:25.382
All right.
Go back to your thing.

01:05:26.353 --> 01:05:27.650
Sorry, sir.

01:05:30.024 --> 01:05:33.720
Dad, we get channel four
now, but not channel seven.

01:05:33.826 --> 01:05:36.192
Arthur, how could you
do that to this family?

01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:39.857
- On Sy's... - It's hardly a crime,
I mean, nobody got hurt.

01:05:39.965 --> 01:05:41.398
That doesn't
make it right!

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.195
He won
a lot of money, Dad.

01:05:43.301 --> 01:05:45.030
The Meticulous
really works!

01:05:46.238 --> 01:05:47.568
You knew about it?

01:05:48.973 --> 01:05:50.531
- Well...
- They must have finked me out.

01:05:51.509 --> 01:05:52.908
They knew I could
just go on winning,

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:54.499
so they blackballed me
and now...

01:05:54.577 --> 01:05:56.044
What did you do with the money you won?

01:06:00.316 --> 01:06:01.544
What's going on?

01:06:01.651 --> 01:06:03.515
Well, I didn't want it, and
Danny said that he could use it...

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:04.745
That is so unfair!

01:06:04.853 --> 01:06:06.184
- What are you...
- I'll tell you what's unfair.

01:06:06.255 --> 01:06:08.223
What's unfair is them not letting
me play in their card game.

01:06:08.323 --> 01:06:10.347
Why give him the money? You
know what he spends it on?

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:11.483
I know about
the records.

01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:13.584
Records? Do you think he
buys records from Mike Fagle?

01:06:13.695 --> 01:06:15.185
At least I'm not saving
up for a nose job.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:16.559
- What a brat!
- What?

01:06:16.663 --> 01:06:19.530
Nobody in this house is getting
a nose job! You got that?

01:06:20.901 --> 01:06:22.926
Danny! You're not excused!

01:06:23.036 --> 01:06:24.161
We're still talking!

01:06:24.236 --> 01:06:26.033
What was this
card game, Arthur?

01:06:26.105 --> 01:06:28.096
Some goys put together
a private game.

01:06:28.207 --> 01:06:29.401
I think that
they're Italian.

01:06:29.508 --> 01:06:30.941
Danny!
What's going on?

01:06:31.043 --> 01:06:33.510
Danny? We're
sitting shiva here.

01:06:42.753 --> 01:06:48.554
Well, she has retained Barney
Silver at Tuchman, Marsh.

01:06:49.726 --> 01:06:51.387
This is a...

01:06:52.395 --> 01:06:55.886
- This is an aggressive firm, Larry.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:06:55.964 --> 01:06:58.899
These are not
pleasant people.

01:06:58.967 --> 01:07:02.094
Judith is free to
retain whoever she...

01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:05.530
I take it
you don't talk?

01:07:07.975 --> 01:07:11.375
It's hard. I think she
emptied our bank account.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:12.411
Mmm.

01:07:12.479 --> 01:07:16.574
- I tried to ask her about it,
very civilly. She... - Yeah.

01:07:16.648 --> 01:07:21.984
Yeah, you need to open a new
account in your name only.

01:07:22.087 --> 01:07:24.452
Put your pay checks in
there from here on out.

01:07:24.555 --> 01:07:26.284
- Can I?
- Oh, absolutely.

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:27.914
It's not dishonest?

01:07:27.992 --> 01:07:29.721
Oh, absolutely.

01:07:29.794 --> 01:07:31.385
- You...
- I hate to say this,

01:07:31.461 --> 01:07:35.227
but I think she's also been
sneaking cash out of my wallet.

01:07:35.298 --> 01:07:37.323
Oh, boy Oh, boy.

01:07:37.667 --> 01:07:43.332
Yeah, well, this is
definitely adversarial.

01:07:46.941 --> 01:07:49.466
Larry? Are you
all right? Larry!

01:07:49.577 --> 01:07:53.273
Hey, come on now! Larry!
There's no need for that.

01:07:53.347 --> 01:07:55.110
Larry, Larry, we...

01:07:55.182 --> 01:07:57.844
We're going to
get through this.

01:08:02.588 --> 01:08:05.079
Have you talked
to the Rabbi?

01:08:10.662 --> 01:08:12.357
I talked to Nachtner.

01:08:13.265 --> 01:08:15.698
Was he helpful
at all?

01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:20.830
What, did he tell you
about the goy's teeth?

01:08:22.705 --> 01:08:24.866
You should try to
talk to Marshak.

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:28.304
They told me he doesn't
do pastoral work anymore.

01:08:28.377 --> 01:08:29.470
He just...

01:08:30.879 --> 01:08:33.643
...congratulates the
bar mitzvah boy every week.

01:08:33.715 --> 01:08:35.046
Well, that's too bad.

01:08:35.551 --> 01:08:38.849
He's a very wise man,
Marshak.

01:08:39.487 --> 01:08:40.783
Getting old.

01:08:41.721 --> 01:08:42.881
Very old.

01:08:44.058 --> 01:08:45.888
No, me.

01:08:47.794 --> 01:08:50.388
- Uh, Dick Dutton. Columbia Record Club.
- Not now.

01:08:50.497 --> 01:08:52.225
Does he ever
come to the phone?

01:08:55.801 --> 01:08:58.234
If I came in, could...

01:09:01.339 --> 01:09:04.240
Well, how about at Rabbi
Marsha’s convenience?

01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:07.136
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.545
Well, could I give you
my number at the Jolly Roger?

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:13.343
X squared,
so that delta X equals

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:16.510
the square root of
.077 A squared minus zero,

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:19.817
from which we derive the
square root of.077 A squared.

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:21.412
And also, the uncertainty

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:24.822
in P is equal to the square
root of bracket P squared

01:09:24.893 --> 01:09:27.361
minus bracket P squared,

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:29.919
which also equals the square
root of H over A squared.

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:32.760
Which lets us
delta X, delta P

01:09:32.867 --> 01:09:36.769
equals the square root
of.077 A squared,

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:42.240
H over A squared,
and 1.74 H bar.

01:09:42.341 --> 01:09:43.707
Okay?

01:09:43.776 --> 01:09:45.332
The Uncertainty Principle.

01:09:45.944 --> 01:09:49.037
It proves we can't
ever really know

01:09:49.113 --> 01:09:50.671
what's going on.

01:09:55.219 --> 01:09:58.882
But even though you can't
figure anything out,

01:09:58.956 --> 01:10:01.788
you will be responsible
for it on the mid-term.

01:10:05.695 --> 01:10:07.958
- Did you follow that?
- Of course.

01:10:08.597 --> 01:10:11.225
Except that I know
what's going on.

01:10:11.901 --> 01:10:13.391
How do you explain?

01:10:13.469 --> 01:10:17.404
Well, it might be that in,
you know, in olam ha-ba...

01:10:17.472 --> 01:10:20.566
Excuse me, not the point.
In this world, Larry.

01:10:21.708 --> 01:10:25.371
Now I'll concede that
it's subtle, it's clever.

01:10:26.079 --> 01:10:28.808
But at the end of the day,
is it convincing?

01:10:29.315 --> 01:10:31.283
Well, yes,
it's convincing.

01:10:31.384 --> 01:10:33.409
It's a proof.
It's mathematics.

01:10:33.486 --> 01:10:37.819
No, excuse me. Mathematics
is the art of the possible.

01:10:38.623 --> 01:10:40.557
I don't think so.

01:10:40.625 --> 01:10:43.593
The art of the
possible, that's...

01:10:43.661 --> 01:10:45.322
I can't remember.
Something else.

01:10:45.429 --> 01:10:46.760
I'm a serious man, Larry.

01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:50.823
- I know that So, if I've got it wrong,
what do I... - So simple.

01:10:51.601 --> 01:10:53.592
See Marshak.

01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:56.798
I know! I want to see
Marshak! I want to see Marshak!

01:10:57.774 --> 01:10:59.604
I fucked your wife, Larry!

01:10:59.675 --> 01:11:03.076
I seriously fucked her!
That's what's going on!

01:11:03.145 --> 01:11:04.169
See Marshak!

01:11:38.208 --> 01:11:39.607
Mr Gopnik.

01:11:39.676 --> 01:11:42.304
Hello, Mrs Sam sky.

01:11:42.379 --> 01:11:45.677
I was going to knock, and then
I thought you weren't here.

01:11:46.382 --> 01:11:48.145
I thought
I heard something.

01:11:48.217 --> 01:11:50.117
Can I help you?
Do you want to come in?

01:11:50.186 --> 01:11:52.483
- No, I...
- It's cooler.

01:11:52.554 --> 01:11:54.044
Oh. Okay.

01:11:56.291 --> 01:12:02.195
I've noticed that Mr Sam sky
isn't around, and I, uh...

01:12:05.065 --> 01:12:06.964
- He travels.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:12:07.033 --> 01:12:09.831
So I thought I should let you know,
since you're somewhat new here,

01:12:09.902 --> 01:12:14.998
if you ever have, whatever,
chores that you'd, um...

01:12:15.073 --> 01:12:19.737
Or just help with something I've decided
to help others, in a neighbourly way.

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:24.078
- How thoughtful.
- Oh, it's nothing.

01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:27.707
It's just good to know
your neighbours, and to help.

01:12:27.817 --> 01:12:29.250
Help others.

01:12:29.586 --> 01:12:34.046
Although I don't care much for my
neighbours on the other side, I must say.

01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:37.991
- Goys, aren't they?
- Mmm. Very much so.

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.086
Although maybe it's not fair
to judge. I have to admit...

01:12:41.196 --> 01:12:42.560
Won't you sit down?

01:12:42.663 --> 01:12:45.029
Oh, um...
Okay. Thank you.

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:47.260
- Iced tea? I have some.
- Okay.

01:12:53.073 --> 01:12:54.700
I don't see you
much around either.

01:12:55.509 --> 01:12:59.877
Yes, actually I haven't been
home a lot recently. I, uh...

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.275
My wife and I are...

01:13:04.283 --> 01:13:09.117
Well, she's got me staying at the Jolly
Roger, the little motel there on...

01:13:10.021 --> 01:13:11.784
You're in the
doghouse, huh?

01:13:12.623 --> 01:13:17.117
Yes. That's an understatement,
I guess. Thank you.

01:13:17.227 --> 01:13:19.252
I guess I...

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:22.388
Do you take advantage
of the new freedoms?

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.135
What do you mean?

01:13:39.313 --> 01:13:41.076
It's something I do.

01:13:42.482 --> 01:13:44.211
For recreation.

01:13:46.152 --> 01:13:47.312
That's

01:13:48.987 --> 01:13:50.818
...marijuana?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:13:53.325 --> 01:13:55.486
You'll find you'll
need the iced tea.

01:13:59.997 --> 01:14:01.259
Is it...

01:14:04.468 --> 01:14:05.958
Well, okay.

01:14:27.821 --> 01:14:30.255
Maybe Rabbi Scott was right.

01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:33.024
Who's Rabbi Scott?

01:14:36.429 --> 01:14:38.260
The junior rabbi.

01:14:39.832 --> 01:14:40.923
The junior rabbi.

01:14:55.312 --> 01:14:56.539
What did he say?

01:14:57.514 --> 01:14:59.004
He spoke of

01:15:00.984 --> 01:15:02.508
perception.

01:15:04.653 --> 01:15:06.712
All my problems
are just...

01:15:08.991 --> 01:15:10.117
Just a...

01:15:11.993 --> 01:15:13.620
A mere...

01:15:16.797 --> 01:15:18.388
Is that a siren?

01:15:19.866 --> 01:15:20.890
No.

01:15:22.903 --> 01:15:24.370
Sometimes people
get paranoid...

01:15:24.504 --> 01:15:26.027
Holy cow, that is a siren.

01:15:31.911 --> 01:15:32.899
Hey!

01:15:34.913 --> 01:15:35.902
Hey!

01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:39.138
Hey!

01:15:39.217 --> 01:15:40.410
Does this man live here?

01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:43.181
- Sort of. He sleeps on the couch.
- This is crazy!

01:15:43.253 --> 01:15:45.187
I didn't know what to tell them
They asked me for my address.

01:15:45.255 --> 01:15:47.553
It's just mathematics. You can't
arrest a man for mathematics.

01:15:47.657 --> 01:15:49.989
I didn't know whether to tell
them here, or at the Jolly Roger.

01:15:50.059 --> 01:15:51.185
Do you know this man?

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.989
I just figured that this would
sound better. I don't know.

01:15:53.062 --> 01:15:55.689
Dad, why is Uncle Arthur
in handcuffs?

01:15:55.764 --> 01:15:58.232
It's all a mistake. I mean,
not a mistake, a miscarriage...

01:15:58.333 --> 01:16:00.164
- Hello, Mrs Sam sky.
- Hello, Arthur.

01:16:00.268 --> 01:16:02.202
- Does this man live here?
- He sleeps on the couch.

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:03.531
Look. What did he do?

01:16:03.604 --> 01:16:06.038
- Nothing! I didn't do anything!
- Dad sleeps on a cot.

01:16:06.106 --> 01:16:08.404
Sir, we picked this man
up at the North Dakota.

01:16:08.509 --> 01:16:11.705
- But I didn't do anything! I didn't...
- The North Dakota?

01:16:11.778 --> 01:16:13.678
Solicitation Sodomy Very serious.

01:16:13.746 --> 01:16:14.872
But I didn't
do anything.

01:16:14.948 --> 01:16:16.040
"Sodomy"?

01:16:17.016 --> 01:16:18.744
What's sodomy,
Dad?

01:16:21.787 --> 01:16:23.618
What does Arthur say?

01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:28.252
He says he didn't
do anything.

01:16:28.359 --> 01:16:29.587
Uh-huh.

01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:34.720
He says he just
went in for a drink.

01:16:34.798 --> 01:16:36.026
Uh-huh.

01:16:39.802 --> 01:16:41.963
- Does Arthur drink?
- No.

01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:43.197
Uh-huh.

01:16:44.406 --> 01:16:46.465
The North Dakota.

01:16:47.809 --> 01:16:48.901
Well...

01:16:51.312 --> 01:16:52.802
You'll need
a criminal attorney.

01:16:52.914 --> 01:16:56.474
- Okay Who's...
- Ron Meshbesher.

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:59.051
- Is he good?
- Ron is very good.

01:17:00.721 --> 01:17:02.483
I don't understand.

01:17:03.322 --> 01:17:06.257
- He goes to mixers at the Hillel House.
- Mmm.

01:17:09.427 --> 01:17:12.157
- I would call Ron Meshbesher.
- Is he expensive?

01:17:12.264 --> 01:17:14.926
Ron is not cheap.

01:17:16.301 --> 01:17:17.392
Yeah.

01:17:17.668 --> 01:17:20.660
Oh, Sol, come in, we
could use some good news.

01:17:22.106 --> 01:17:24.767
Sol's been going over
the property line issue

01:17:24.841 --> 01:17:26.809
and he wouldn't go into
details, but he seems to think

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:29.503
there's a nifty way
out of this.

01:17:29.612 --> 01:17:31.806
Says it was pure luck
that he caught something.

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:34.507
I guess that's why you're
full partner, eh, Sol?

01:17:54.433 --> 01:17:57.493
- Danny's bar mitzvah is...
- This week.

01:17:57.603 --> 01:18:00.663
This Shabbats?
Great, great.

01:18:19.955 --> 01:18:21.786
Professor Gopnik,
Dick Dutton.

01:18:21.857 --> 01:18:23.790
Heart attack.
Call back.

01:18:33.901 --> 01:18:35.129
Larry?

01:18:38.571 --> 01:18:41.802
As you know, the tenure
committee meets on... What?

01:18:43.309 --> 01:18:45.243
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:18:46.345 --> 01:18:48.313
I'm sorry. I know
you've hit a rough patch.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:50.177
Someone just...

01:18:50.248 --> 01:18:52.079
But I'm fine.

01:18:54.418 --> 01:18:58.218
Well, as you know, the tenure
committee meets on Wednesday

01:18:58.322 --> 01:19:00.881
...to make its final
determinations, so if... - Arlen,

01:19:02.759 --> 01:19:04.420
I am not an evil man.

01:19:05.028 --> 01:19:08.190
- No, no, Larry, no, of course not.
- I am not!

01:19:08.263 --> 01:19:10.163
No, we don't make
moral judgments.

01:19:10.232 --> 01:19:13.030
I went to the
Aster Art once.

01:19:13.102 --> 01:19:14.933
I saw Swedish Reverie.

01:19:15.037 --> 01:19:17.061
No, it's okay.
We don't need to know.

01:19:17.171 --> 01:19:18.934
It wasn't even erotic.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.009
Although it was,
in a way.

01:19:22.076 --> 01:19:24.703
It's all right, really,
Larry. Believe me.

01:19:26.747 --> 01:19:27.839
Yeah, okay.

01:19:28.215 --> 01:19:30.876
Okay. Okay.

01:19:32.752 --> 01:19:35.220
So, we decide
on Wednesday.

01:19:35.287 --> 01:19:37.880
So, if there's anything
that you want to

01:19:37.956 --> 01:19:40.424
submit in support of
your tenure application,

01:19:40.525 --> 01:19:43.187
we would need it
by Wednesday.

01:19:43.261 --> 01:19:45.091
Submit? What do you...

01:19:45.195 --> 01:19:47.686
Well, anything.
Any published work.

01:19:47.765 --> 01:19:51.394
Anything you've done
outside the institution.

01:19:51.468 --> 01:19:54.368
Anything at all that
we should be aware of.

01:19:55.405 --> 01:19:57.737
- I haven't done anything.
- Uh-huh.

01:19:57.807 --> 01:19:59.865
- I haven't published.
- Uh-huh.

01:19:59.941 --> 01:20:02.466
- You're still getting those...
- Uh-huh.

01:20:03.245 --> 01:20:07.305
- Those anonymous...
- No, no, I know. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:20:07.415 --> 01:20:09.610
- Okay. Okay. Wednesday?
- Uh-huh.

01:20:09.717 --> 01:20:13.312
Um Okay Uh...
Don't worry.

01:20:14.054 --> 01:20:17.454
Doing nothing is
not bad. Ipso facto.

01:20:18.758 --> 01:20:20.623
Just relax.

01:20:21.494 --> 01:20:23.154
Try to relax.

01:20:24.663 --> 01:20:28.929
Oh, my God,
Mrs. Sam sky!

01:20:29.001 --> 01:20:30.331
So good.

01:20:43.346 --> 01:20:45.836
Nailing it down.
So important.

01:21:07.834 --> 01:21:12.100
Please. I need help. I've already
talked to the other rabbis. Please.

01:21:12.839 --> 01:21:14.999
It's not about
Danny's bar mitzvah.

01:21:15.106 --> 01:21:17.438
My boy, Danny.
This coming Shabbats.

01:21:17.509 --> 01:21:19.443
Very joyous event.
That's all fine.

01:21:19.511 --> 01:21:24.812
It's more about myself. I've
had quite a bit of tsarist lately.

01:21:24.882 --> 01:21:27.282
Marital problems,
professional, you name it.

01:21:27.351 --> 01:21:29.147
This is not
a frivolous request.

01:21:29.219 --> 01:21:30.880
This is a...

01:21:30.987 --> 01:21:32.716
I'm a...

01:21:32.822 --> 01:21:36.189
I've tried to be a
serious man, you know?

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:39.818
Tried to do right, be a member
of the community, raise the...

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:44.058
Danny, Sarah, they both
go to school, Hebrew school.

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:45.689
A good breakfast...

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.361
Well, Danny goes to Hebrew
school, Sarah doesn't have time.

01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:52.165
She mostly
washes her hair.

01:21:53.406 --> 01:21:55.397
Apparently there are
several steps involved,

01:21:55.509 --> 01:21:58.410
but you don't have to tell Marshak
that, just tell him I need help.

01:21:58.511 --> 01:22:00.570
Please. I need help.

01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.555
The Rabbi is busy.

01:22:59.397 --> 01:23:01.194
He didn't look busy.

01:23:03.467 --> 01:23:04.957
He's thinking.

01:23:22.417 --> 01:23:23.645
Arthur?

01:23:31.625 --> 01:23:32.819
Arthur?

01:23:33.827 --> 01:23:35.316
What's wrong?

01:23:35.962 --> 01:23:39.295
It'll be okay.
Arthur, we'll...

01:23:39.398 --> 01:23:42.265
Don't worry, we'll get Ron
Meshbesher It'll be okay...

01:23:48.006 --> 01:23:49.268
Arthur!

01:23:50.841 --> 01:23:52.103
Arthur!

01:24:03.486 --> 01:24:06.818
Arthur! You've got to
pull yourself together!

01:24:06.922 --> 01:24:10.255
It's all shit, Larry!
It's all shit!

01:24:10.325 --> 01:24:11.792
Arthur,
don't use that word.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.986
It's just fucking shit!

01:24:14.095 --> 01:24:15.084
Arthur.

01:24:15.162 --> 01:24:17.460
Look at all that
Hashem has given you!

01:24:17.531 --> 01:24:20.693
What has he given me?
He hasn't given me shit!

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:24.759
Arthur. What do I have?
I live at the Jolly Roger.

01:24:24.838 --> 01:24:28.432
You have a family!
You have a job!

01:24:28.507 --> 01:24:31.806
Hashem hasn't given me shit
He hasn't given me burkes!

01:24:31.877 --> 01:24:34.845
It's not fair to blame
Hashem, Arthur. Please.

01:24:34.946 --> 01:24:36.971
Sometimes...
Please calm down.

01:24:37.048 --> 01:24:39.209
Sometimes you
have to help yourself.

01:24:41.552 --> 01:24:43.712
Hashem hasn't given me shit.

01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:47.955
Now I can't even
play cards.

01:24:55.031 --> 01:24:57.692
It's okay,
it's okay.

01:24:57.832 --> 01:25:00.562
It's okay, it's okay.

01:25:25.857 --> 01:25:27.255
Is this it?

01:25:27.858 --> 01:25:30.725
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, there.

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:45.061
Look, this should help
you get back on your feet.

01:25:50.611 --> 01:25:51.703
Oh, my God
Where did you get this?

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:53.269
- It doesn't matter.
- This is a lot of money.

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:56.205
- It should get you started.
- I know, but this is a lot of money.

01:25:56.349 --> 01:25:58.044
- You sure you don't need it?
- Arthur, I'm fine.

01:25:58.118 --> 01:25:59.745
Come on, get in
When you're settled,

01:25:59.853 --> 01:26:01.548
let me know how
to get in touch.

01:26:01.621 --> 01:26:03.520
You're sure?

01:26:03.589 --> 01:26:04.954
It's fine.

01:26:22.372 --> 01:26:25.034
Larry. I'm sorry.

01:26:26.142 --> 01:26:27.541
What I said last night.

01:26:27.610 --> 01:26:29.305
I know.

01:26:29.412 --> 01:26:30.777
It's okay.

01:26:35.817 --> 01:26:37.079
Goodbye!

01:26:46.594 --> 01:26:48.618
There's another Jew, son!

01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:09.444
Were we out at
the pool last night?

01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:13.241
Yeah.

01:27:15.485 --> 01:27:16.816
I'm sorry.

01:27:25.293 --> 01:27:26.783
It's Shabbats.

01:27:30.698 --> 01:27:32.358
Give me that fucker.

01:30:32.188 --> 01:30:36.022
I'm sorry that... That things
have been so hard for us.

01:30:37.694 --> 01:30:39.092
It's okay.

01:30:40.195 --> 01:30:42.823
Sy had so much respect for you, Larry.

01:30:44.533 --> 01:30:47.296
He wrote letters to
the tenure committee.

01:30:59.446 --> 01:31:01.379
Jesus Christ.

01:31:03.215 --> 01:31:05.979
...taking your place
as a member of our tribe.

01:31:06.051 --> 01:31:08.177
Now, you will go
and see Rabbi Marshak.

01:31:08.286 --> 01:31:12.052
Afterwards, you will celebrate in a
reception downstairs in Schanfield Hall.

01:31:12.156 --> 01:31:16.353
And then, you will be a member of
B'Nai Avraham and the Nation of Israel.

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:20.658
Danny Gopnik, the Sisterhood makes
a gift to you of this Kiddush cup,

01:31:20.731 --> 01:31:24.996
so that you will remember this blessed
day on the next Shabbats and the next,

01:31:25.067 --> 01:31:27.627
and on every Shabbats
of a long and fruitful life.

01:31:27.703 --> 01:31:32.833
And until that wonderful day when you
stand under the chuppah, we say amen.

01:33:12.127 --> 01:33:15.118
When the truth

01:33:16.497 --> 01:33:18.089
is found

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.490
to be lies...

01:33:30.476 --> 01:33:33.343
...and all the hope

01:33:34.113 --> 01:33:37.513
within you dies...

01:33:46.823 --> 01:33:48.188
Then what?

01:33:50.759 --> 01:33:53.421
Grace Slick.

01:33:54.864 --> 01:33:57.128
Marty Balin.

01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:00.699
Paul Kantner.

01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:04.035
Jorma...

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:06.199
Kekkonen.

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.030
...something.

01:34:09.042 --> 01:34:12.443
These are the members

01:34:13.646 --> 01:34:15.978
of the Airplane.

01:34:16.048 --> 01:34:18.039
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

01:34:50.144 --> 01:34:51.668
Be a good boy.

01:34:57.584 --> 01:34:59.518
Danny was magnificent.

01:35:00.754 --> 01:35:01.743
Oh.

01:35:02.355 --> 01:35:04.084
Thank you, Arlen.

01:35:04.191 --> 01:35:06.750
Mazel tov.
It was wonderful.

01:35:07.359 --> 01:35:09.919
Yes, it was. Thank you.

01:35:10.029 --> 01:35:12.553
Such a time of nachos.

01:35:12.664 --> 01:35:15.428
He's your youngest,
you have to savour it.

01:35:15.934 --> 01:35:17.094
I do.

01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:19.397
I will.

01:35:20.370 --> 01:35:23.396
- Well, see you at the staff cafe.
- Yes.

01:35:23.507 --> 01:35:24.769
I, uh...

01:35:25.576 --> 01:35:26.941
Just, um...

01:35:27.944 --> 01:35:31.880
I shouldn't tell you this,
I'm not telling you officially.

01:35:31.948 --> 01:35:35.610
The tenure candidates aren't
notified till Thursday.

01:35:38.186 --> 01:35:39.278
Yes?

01:35:40.188 --> 01:35:42.018
You'll be very pleased.

01:35:44.625 --> 01:35:48.425
- Thank you, Arlen.
- I didn't say anything Mazel tov.

01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:44.303
Fagle.

01:37:23.544 --> 01:37:26.307
There's a tornado warning
from the weather service.

01:37:26.379 --> 01:37:30.975
Mr. Torchy has decided to move us
into the basement of the synagogue.

01:37:33.385 --> 01:37:35.046
We will form two lines.

01:38:30.869 --> 01:38:34.201
That fucking flag's going to
rip right off the flagpole!

01:38:48.917 --> 01:38:49.941
Hello?

01:38:50.753 --> 01:38:52.846
- Larry?
- Yes?

01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:54.513
Hi, Len Shapiro.

01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:57.524
Oh. Hello, Dr. Shapiro.

01:38:57.592 --> 01:38:59.856
Listen,
mazel tov on Danny.

01:38:59.927 --> 01:39:01.724
Yes, thank you.

01:39:01.796 --> 01:39:06.129
Listen, could you come by to
discuss these x-ray results?

01:39:10.469 --> 01:39:11.697
Hello?

01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:15.198
Yes?

01:39:15.274 --> 01:39:17.605
Larry, could you come in to
discuss these x-ray results?

01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:20.041
You remember the
x- rays we took?

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:24.248
We can't discuss them
over the phone?

01:39:25.315 --> 01:39:27.374
I think we'd be more
comfortable in person.

01:39:28.452 --> 01:39:30.079
Can you come in?

01:39:31.422 --> 01:39:33.412
- When?
- Now.

01:39:33.489 --> 01:39:36.481
Now is good.
I've cleared some time now.

01:39:44.733 --> 01:39:47.132
Hey, Fagle!

01:39:50.304 --> 01:39:52.101
Fagle, I got your...
