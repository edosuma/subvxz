11:02.928 --> 11:04.463

Not close chapters.

{\an8}I've been very vocal about it.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.830
{\an8}The reason being is because

they're being
their true selves, you know?

18:53.932 --> 18:55.167
{\an8}<i>I think that we're</i>

<i>on the line.</i>

18:56.702 --> 18:58.737
{\an8}Like, this is supposed to be
"Ex on the Beach."

18:58.804 --> 19:00.005
{\an8}This is supposed to be
something that, like,

19:00.072 --> 19:01.807
{\an8}drives feelings and emotions

19:01.874 --> 19:03.842
{\an8}and closure
and new beginnings.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.577
{\an8}And like, I just don't think
that either of them

19:05.644 --> 19:07.479
{\an8}are gonna take
any of that away.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.615

the whole Devin situation,

19:16.154 --> 19:18.891
{\an8}and she doesn't really handle
her emotions that well.

19:18.957 --> 19:20.692
<i>So now she's just going off</i>
<i>on the Kaplans.</i>

19:20.759 --> 19:22.427

19:22.494 --> 19:24.329

19:30.936 --> 19:32.571
- Watch your head.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.139
Yep. We'll see you.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.941
{\an8}<i>I think when her mom</i>
<i>and sister agree on something,</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:38.977
{\an8}they outweigh
Lexi's own personal opinion.

19:39.044 --> 19:42.881
{\an8}And for me, that's something
that I can't deal with,

19:42.948 --> 19:44.983
{\an8}<i>because when I have</i>
<i>a significant other,</i>

19:45.050 --> 19:47.519
{\an8}<i>I want that girl to be able</i>
<i>to make her own decisions.</i>

19:47.586 --> 19:49.354
{\an8}And I think that's a pretty
reasonable thing to want.

19:49.421 --> 19:52.357
Videos them saying that their
mom doesn't like me which is--

19:52.424 --> 19:54.293

- Yeah, I am.

19:58.397 --> 20:00.265
- Okay, so what's corny?
- I think the corny part

20:00.332 --> 20:02.568
is that all this
is fake bull[bleep].

20:02.634 --> 20:04.369

{\an8}- Marie is losing her mind.
She enjoys chaos.

20:12.344 --> 20:17.449
{\an8}The Kaplan twins have very
small amounts of chaos, if any,

20:17.516 --> 20:19.418
