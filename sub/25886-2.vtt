00:10.875 --> 00:14.125
And the stadium explodes!
Names are chanted!

00:14.125 --> 00:16.333
Roses fly through the air!
[imitating crowd cheering]

00:16.333 --> 00:18.750
Yeah! We totally killed it!

00:18.750 --> 00:22.458
Although-- brainstorming here--
as I was singing the chorus,
a whole new verse came to me.

00:22.458 --> 00:24.458
M.J., stop!

00:24.458 --> 00:26.875
You can't keep tweaking songs
every time we play them.

00:26.875 --> 00:29.458
I know.
I just want us to be perfect.

00:29.458 --> 00:33.792
And we will be, someday.
But we're still in high school,
you know?

00:33.792 --> 00:36.709
Garage bands are garage bands
for a reason.
[cymbal crashes]

00:36.709 --> 00:40.625
And its name is the two hours
of pre-calc homework
I still have.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.083
Look, let's call it a day
and go home.

00:43.083 --> 00:47.083
Gloria cannot fail calc.
Betty can rearrange
her YA first editions again.

00:47.083 --> 00:49.792
You can record your tweak,
and if it's still better

00:49.792 --> 00:51.792
in the morning,
we'll listen to it, okay?

00:51.792 --> 00:54.333
Fine.
But it's gonna be so great,

00:54.333 --> 00:56.709
you'll be dying
to change it.

00:56.709 --> 00:58.208
See ya around, Stacy.

00:58.208 --> 01:00.250
Bye.

01:00.250 --> 01:03.542
So, how are you doing,
Gwen?

01:04.542 --> 01:06.458
[crying]
No.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.583
You know me, Glory.

01:08.583 --> 01:11.250
All's fine and dandy
in Gwenlandia.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.083
I thought you had
mountains of homework.

01:13.083 --> 01:15.458
I do.
I just wanted to talk.

01:15.458 --> 01:18.583
We haven't really talked
since Kevin's funeral.

01:18.583 --> 01:22.417
[crying]
<i>And you really need to talk.</i>

01:22.417 --> 01:24.917
<i>It's not healthy.</i>

01:24.917 --> 01:27.542
Neither are cookies,
but you know how I--

01:27.542 --> 01:29.542
Hey! I'm serious, Gwen!

01:29.542 --> 01:31.709
I know. But Kevin
is seriously gone, Glory.

01:31.709 --> 01:33.542
My best friend
was taken from me,

01:33.542 --> 01:35.875
and until I find out
who did it,
there's nothing to say.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.542
"Who did it"?
Ghost Spider did it!

01:40.041 --> 01:42.125
[laughing]
Wow, Gwen!

01:42.125 --> 01:44.542
You have powers?

01:44.542 --> 01:46.625
No, she didn't.
The real criminal--

01:46.625 --> 01:50.125
The Ghost Spider is responsible
for Kevin's death, Gwen.

01:50.125 --> 01:52.792
You've got to accept that.

01:52.792 --> 01:57.125
Even if she didn't do it,
whoever did had powers,
and you don't.

01:57.125 --> 01:59.500
You can't go after people
like that, Gwen.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.834
It's not gonna end well.

02:04.709 --> 02:07.041
Just because you're a superhero
doesn't mean

02:07.041 --> 02:10.291
I'm gonna finish
your book report.
Ah, but you will.

02:10.291 --> 02:13.500
What, you think my dad
just stops doing the right thing
because it's dangerous?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.875
Even cops know when to call
the Avengers.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.375
Listen, I'm on your side.

02:18.375 --> 02:20.834
That's why I want you
to be careful.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.291
I know.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.500
And it's really annoying.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.834
[chuckles]
Hmm?

02:27.834 --> 02:29.875
[chuckles]
On that note,

02:29.875 --> 02:32.417
take it easy, Stacy.

02:32.417 --> 02:34.834
[chuckles]
See ya.

02:37.959 --> 02:40.709
Sorry, Gloria,
but I know who did this,

02:40.709 --> 02:42.375
and I'm bringing her in--

02:42.375 --> 02:45.750
<i>her and her friends.</i>

02:45.750 --> 02:48.959
[helicopter blades whirring]
<i>I nearly had her last night,</i>

02:48.959 --> 02:52.000
<i>but I was too stupid to think</i>
<i>that she'd bring backup.</i>

02:54.792 --> 02:58.291
Who are you?
Why did you go after Kevin?

02:58.291 --> 02:59.375
Huh?

02:59.375 --> 03:02.250
[grunts]

03:02.250 --> 03:05.500
They may have gotten away,
but I'm not out...

03:05.500 --> 03:08.125
yet!
[yells]

03:10.500 --> 03:13.333
Hi. My name's Patriot.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.500
You're under arrest
by order of S.H.I.E.L.D.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.667
A little late to the party.

03:17.667 --> 03:20.834
I've had the NYPD
after me for months.

03:20.834 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, but they weren't trained
by Captain America. I was.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
We can do this
the easy way, or--
[gasps]

03:28.000 --> 03:29.542
[grunts]

03:29.542 --> 03:31.542
Captain America
should have trained you better.

03:31.542 --> 03:33.375
[straining]

03:35.375 --> 03:36.709
[grunts]

03:37.792 --> 03:39.625
No, you don't!

03:39.625 --> 03:41.709
[yells, grunts]

03:43.208 --> 03:46.041
Okay. Now I'm annoyed.
[grunts]

[both grunting]

04:02.166 --> 04:04.583
Huh? Where'd she go?

04:06.500 --> 04:07.750
What?

04:07.750 --> 04:10.583
Ugh! You gotta
be kidding me.

04:10.583 --> 04:14.125
[beeps]
Agent Johnson,
circle around to Point 2.

04:14.125 --> 04:17.917
I've located the Ghost Spider,
and believe it or not,
she picked the hard way.

04:17.917 --> 04:19.750
Patriot out.
