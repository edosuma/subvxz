His family
was having problems.

He didn't have to leave,

like I had to rush things.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.995
You were lucky.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.432
A person in a different
situation might be thinking

18:49.476 --> 18:51.739
about doing stuff with somebody
because they're going away

18:51.782 --> 18:53.610
and that person doesn't want
them to forget them.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.398

tell me what you think.

I appreciate the effort,

Thanks for trusting me
to make my own decision.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.071
No.
Why wouldn't I trust you?

19:20.115 --> 19:21.203
You're a smart kid.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.248
You know that doing something

19:22.291 --> 19:24.598
that you're not physically
and emotionally ready for

19:24.641 --> 19:26.991
would have
serious consequences.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.341

it's gonna hurt.

what Mark said.

We just had a good talk.
