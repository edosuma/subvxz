WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.844
CECIL: Every Papist in the
Kingdom is a potential traitor.

00:03.880 --> 00:06.929
They must be watched and
made to answer for their crime.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.281
What you propose, sir,
is a recipe for rebellion.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.049
On the contrary,
My Lord Northumberland

00:11.080 --> 00:13.526
it is a recipe to avoid rebellion.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.164
ROBERT:
My sister was crushed like a seed.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.168
SHE SCREAMS
- CROWD CHEERS

00:17.200 --> 00:19.601
ROBERT:
My brother, butchered like a hog.

DANIEL SCREAMS

00:20.600 --> 00:22.011
They will be revenged.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.451
The sword plays no part
in what we do.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.131
WADE: Can His Majesty not see
the danger the Kingdom is in?

00:26.160 --> 00:29.004
CECIL: Flanders is where these
dangerous spirits are gathered.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.043
My name is Guy Fawkes.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.684
HE STABS TURNER

00:33.720 --> 00:35.245
I have nothing to do with
desperate men.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.762
I am... a desperate man.

01:24.480 --> 01:29.520
GREGORIAN CHANTS SOUND

01:45.280 --> 01:46.645
Gentlemen.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.570
His Excellency,
the Constable of Castille.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.801
Ahem.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.409
Your Excellency,
I am Robert Catesby...

01:59.440 --> 02:01.920
His Excellency knows who you are,
Master Catesby.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.405
State your purpose.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.768
My purpose is to
kill the King of England.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.208
In our country, as Catholics

02:11.240 --> 02:13.163
we are hunted

02:14.000 --> 02:15.411
pfisoned,fined

02:16.080 --> 02:18.367
banished, tortured and hanged.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.889
Kings are anointed of God.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.809
James is a pretended king.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.921
And a tyrant.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.647
God alone disposes of kings.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.920
Good or bad.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.450
Help us, Excellency.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.209
Spain is our only hope.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.202
CONSTABLE SIGHS

02:37.240 --> 02:39.208
How would have Spain help you?

02:40.720 --> 02:42.165
Send us soldiers.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.011
Send us arms and horses

02:45.040 --> 02:46.883
that we may restore
the True Faith.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.641
The treaty that is presently
under negotiation

02:49.680 --> 02:51.603
between his Catholic Majesty
King Felipe

02:51.640 --> 02:53.165
and King James of England

02:53.840 --> 02:56.286
will see an end to your
persecution.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.004
Before any treaty is signed

02:58.040 --> 03:00.725
we will be overpowered
and uprooted

03:02.400 --> 03:04.562
We will be utterly destroyed.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.366
I beg you, Excellency.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.689
Do not suffer this to happen.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.929
We will consider your petition.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.091
PEN SCRATCHES

03:28.720 --> 03:30.563
Sir, if you saw what I have seen

03:30.600 --> 03:32.443
you would not weep tears
of pity and rage

03:32.480 --> 03:34.562
though your eyes would
be pricked and red.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.484
You would reach for your sword

03:38.240 --> 03:40.208
as I reach for mine.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.530
WADE:
I have news of Catesby.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.728
He was seen in the company
of his cousin Wintour

04:04.760 --> 04:06.762
and also with Jack Wright.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.483
Catesby, Wintour and Wright.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.443
That is a dangerous pack.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.367
Where are they now?

04:12.400 --> 04:13.925
Wright has returned to Yorkshire

04:13.960 --> 04:16.166
but Catesby and Wintour
have not been seen since.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.771
Instruct the searchers at the ports

04:18.800 --> 04:21.610
to keep a lookout for Catesby
and his cousin.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.210
Have them closely watched.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.842
If they're trying to join
Stanley's exiles in Brussels

04:27.880 --> 04:29.609
I want to know about it.

CECIL:
Good day, Madam.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.210
What a splendid house.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.326
I had not expected anything
so... beautiful.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.043
Perhaps a little barren.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.970
We have you to thank
for our bareness, sir.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.370
What a wonderful inheritance.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.404
I congratulate you
on your great good fortune.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.283
Get you gone, sir!

BOWLING SOUNDS IN BACKGROUND

05:39.560 --> 05:41.881
The boy's father is not at home?

05:41.920 --> 05:44.651
Have you come all this way to
put me to interrogation?

05:45.480 --> 05:47.801
I ask not as the King's secretary

05:47.840 --> 05:49.842
but as a neglectful father.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.802
I have a son of my own.
William.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.410
But I am too much about
the King's business

05:56.440 --> 05:58.727
and so see little of my boy.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.605
To my great regret.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.366
You have it right, sir.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.880
You are too much about
the King's business.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.126
I am merely the servant of the state.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.528
I was apprenticed to this trade
by my father.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.847
It is a trade that deals in darkness.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.850
Well, I cannot deny it.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.882
Has your cousin Robert
travelled out of the Kingdom?

06:21.920 --> 06:24.127
It seems you have come to interrogate.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.770
Your cousin, it seems, is set
on a very perilous course.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.648
But he may still be turned back.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.283
Help me to save him
before it is too late.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.690
Tell me where he is.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.842
BOWLING CONTINUES

06:48.120 --> 06:50.691
I try to see the good in men, sir.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.322
For that is the Lord's teaching
and my poor understanding of it

06:55.360 --> 06:57.249
that we all have goodness
in our hearts

06:57.280 --> 06:59.009
before evil and darkness.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.885
But you, sir...

07:02.800 --> 07:04.802
You have racked and tortured.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.009
You have hunted and struck down

07:07.040 --> 07:08.644
and led the condemned
to the block

07:08.680 --> 07:10.330
and to the stake.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.320
Your trade has become your life, sir.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.721
Both are conducted in darkness.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.763
BOWLING CONTINUES

07:28.200 --> 07:29.964
That was truly delicious.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.684
May I trouble you for more?

07:46.920 --> 07:48.763
YOUNG ROBERT LAUGHS

07:53.040 --> 07:55.441
Ready my horse.
- My Lord?

07:56.200 --> 07:57.929
Ready my horse.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.445
Yes, My Lord.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.081
When does your father
return from Brussels?

08:08.560 --> 08:10.289
My father is not in Brussels.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.450
I think you are wrong, young man.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.164
I know he is in Brussels.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.447
No, sir.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.251
My father is in Spain.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.569
That man is a devil.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.482
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

08:40.159 --> 08:41.400
Catesby is in Spain.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.765
Why have you brought us here?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.888
His Excellency the Constable
directed me to bring you here

09:29.920 --> 09:32.161
so that you might see
with your own eyes...

09:32.200 --> 09:33.167
BOUND MAN SCREAMS

09:33.200 --> 09:35.965
...the pain Spain goes to protect
the True Faith.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.641
ROBERT: Who is she?
- A Jew.

09:49.360 --> 09:52.091
Those who do not confess
die by fire.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.523
Will Spain help us,
yes or no?

09:59.240 --> 10:02.608
Spain cannot support your design.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.371
Spain would have a
Protestant king on the throne?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.926
Spain would have a king
who would negotiate.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.804
Twenty years is a long time
to be at war.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.567
Have faith in Spain, gentlemen.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.045
She will protect you

10:18.080 --> 10:20.367
as she protects,
by these means

10:21.560 --> 10:23.608
the faithful in her own land.

DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS

11:16.160 --> 11:18.527
No, we erred to come here.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.527
Hm.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.481
Foreign princes will never
provide the remedy we seek.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.206
We must instead rouse
our fellow Englishmen.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.764
The remedy is close.

11:30.800 --> 11:31.881
It is here.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.642
In our hearts.
- Aye.

11:35.240 --> 11:38.528
Just as it lives on in the hearts
of the exiles in Flanders.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.526
Come, we have work to do.

12:08.280 --> 12:11.250
From Don Juan Fernémdez
de Velasco.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.009
Constable of Castille.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.404
To Charles de Ligne

12:15.880 --> 12:18.531
presently residing in London.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.847
The searchers at Dover
intercepted it this morning.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.769
CECIL:
Make haste, Master Alford.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.370
Break the Constable's cipher.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.404
Let us hear what the Spanish
want for their treaty.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.566
CHURCH BELLS TOLL

12:58.880 --> 12:59.847

CHICKENS CLUCK

Oh, no, no.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.280
ROBERT:
Who's this?

13:16.720 --> 13:18.051
This is not Stanley.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.602
I said I would speak to
Sir William Stanley

13:22.640 --> 13:23.766
and no other.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.090
Stanley is here.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.045
ROBERT GASPS

13:30.080 --> 13:33.050
STANLEY: I see in the son
the father I once knew.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.488
Tom Wintour, my cousin.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.322
A lawyer I'm told.
- Aye.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.970
Though not versed
in argument well enough

13:46.000 --> 13:48.321
to turn our friends in Madrid
to our purpose.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.410
And what is your purpose?

13:52.640 --> 13:53.926
Speak freely.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.361
Fawkes here is my trusted
confederate.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.683
We mean to lead
the Catholics of England

13:59.720 --> 14:00.881
out of their oppression.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.608
How? By what means?

14:04.040 --> 14:07.089
If you help us raise an army
for the rebellion

14:07.880 --> 14:10.360
all that I need can be
found freely in London.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.164
It is there in abundant.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.530
Gunpowder.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.723
STANLEY:
Wintour you trust?

14:22.760 --> 14:23.807
With my life.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.849
We'll need more men
for this venture.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.090
There are others.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.849
Equal to Wintour,
known to me personally

14:30.880 --> 14:32.086
by family and kin.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.804
Find them.
And swear them to your cause.

14:35.840 --> 14:36.921
I will.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.370
Fawkes is a man with
excellent knowledge

14:41.400 --> 14:43.402
of engineering and fortification.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.730
I do not know what to
make of him.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.966
The man says nothing.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.684
Well, that's his great strength.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.848
You'll find him well-fitted
to your purpose.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.724
If you say he is fitted,
then I will have him.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.603
It will not be easy, Robin.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.521
Cecil's esp/os are everywhere.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.964
They must not discover
your design

15:03.000 --> 15:06.129
or that I am gathering men
to invade England in your wake.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.325
The sooner you strike

15:08.360 --> 15:10.203
the more chance
of success.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.647
I am ready to return to England.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.242
My Lord, we have deciphered
the Spanish letter.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.807
Thank you, Master Alford.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.209
I am most grateful.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.530
Most grateful.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.203
NORTHUMBERLAND:
They will in no wise be soothed out

15:39.240 --> 15:40.730
but rather disturbed

15:40.760 --> 15:43.969
and the end you achieve will
be the opposite of that you intend.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.890
HOWARD: Papists burst out
of the dark corners of the land

15:46.920 --> 15:48.126
infecting the godly.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.804
I know you have a misguided
sympathy for their plight

15:51.840 --> 15:53.251
My Lord Northumberland

15:53.280 --> 15:55.442
but we promised laws
against them.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.209
We must now deliver on
that promise

15:57.240 --> 15:58.730
or will we be utterly destroyed.

15:58.760 --> 15:59.841
NORTHUMBERLAND:
No.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.530
If we enforce these laws

16:01.560 --> 16:03.961
then the Spanish will
break off their negotiation.

16:04.440 --> 16:08.081
The negotiations must
be brought to a good pass.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.804
War has emptied the treasury.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.684
Our Kingdom demands peace.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.124
I, the King, demand peace.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.930
As Your Majesty knows
better than we do

16:22.800 --> 16:25.531
God demands true religion.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.481
Fortunately, My Lords,
we can have both.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.409
Both peace and true religion.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.724
Spain does not like these laws,
nor their enforcement

16:36.760 --> 16:40.128
but she will sign the treaty
nonetheless.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.124
You cannot know this.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.087
It is my business to know it,
My Lord.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.330
Spain will put commerce
and self-interest

16:49.360 --> 16:52.330
before any imagined duty to
the Papists of England.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.163
Then I shall have my laws
against the Catholics as well.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.971
JAMES CLEARS THROAT

17:03.960 --> 17:05.689
But you had best be right,
My Lord.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.762
GERARD: Have you read
the King's proclamation?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.165
'Let there no doubt

17:14.200 --> 17:17.646
I have never at any time
entertained intention

17:17.680 --> 17:20.523
of tolerating their utterly
abhorrent, wicked

17:20.560 --> 17:22.608
and detestable religion.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.810
The King's own words.

17:27.599 --> 17:28.840
The Parliament

17:29.480 --> 17:31.926
intends to make us
capital enemies of the state.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.122
We are dogs to be beaten,
boars to be hunted.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.525
We must pray

17:36.480 --> 17:38.687
that God pours His love
and understanding

17:38.720 --> 17:42.042
into the hearts of those in
Parliament who are against us.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.166
You...

17:46.720 --> 17:47.687
You...

17:48.280 --> 17:49.884
You sit there in comfort.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.768
Secreted away from Cecil
and his espios.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.326
You... you read your books,
you drink your wine.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.840
You do not lack for meat.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.882
But I say that you have forgotten

17:59.920 --> 18:01.763
that outside these walls

18:01.800 --> 18:04.041
your flock suffers,
Father Garnet.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.561
Spain has vowed to protect us.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.244
They will not allow
these laws to pass.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.964
I saw it...

18:18.560 --> 18:21.086
when poor Father Smith
was brought to his Calvary.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.446
I saw it in your eyes then
and I see it now.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.091
You are a coward.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.289
I am not afraid to defend
our faith with a strong arm.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.244
Catesby has it aright.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.284
I will stand with him.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.840
DOOR SHUTS

18:58.840 --> 19:00.365
You are no coward.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.523
But here I hide.

19:06.680 --> 19:10.127
With the priests all fastened
for my own purposes

19:10.160 --> 19:12.811
so that I may survive
while others do not.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.203
You are the flame around
which the faithful gather.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.327
That flame must be kept burning.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.530
I do not have your steadfast heart,
Anne.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.925
No, you do.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.886
And my heart is nothing like

19:32.920 --> 19:34.684
as steadfast as you
would believe.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.123
You have a strong heart.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.491
I know it.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.444
It is sometimes strong.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.203
Sometimes weak.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.047
It beats as a
woman's heart beats.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.806
Your Majesty

20:09.840 --> 20:12.320
Don Juan Fernandez
de Velasco

20:12.360 --> 20:14.931
Duke of Frias
and Constable of Castille.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.370
Your Majesty.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.409
By this presence I'm authorised

20:21.440 --> 20:24.444
by His Catholic Majesty
Felipe Ill of Spain and Portugal

20:24.480 --> 20:27.450
to negotiate the treaty
between our two countries.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.720
You are welcome, sir.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.922
It is my earnest hope
that our work

20:30.960 --> 20:32.450
may be speedily concluded.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.961
Sir, His Catholic Majesty
is grievously disturbed

20:37.000 --> 20:39.765
by laws lately proposed
in your Parliament

20:39.800 --> 20:41.643
for the suppression of the faithful.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.607
The good and wholesome laws
made in this Kingdom

20:47.640 --> 20:50.007
are not the concern
of foreign princes.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.245
My master is the protector
of the Catholics of England.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.730
If the threat be not removed
within five days

20:56.760 --> 20:58.888
my orders are
to return to Spain.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.010
With your permission.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.006
You all know me.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.970
I am Robert Catesby.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.046
I am a loyal son of the
One True Church.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.811
I will see her restored
or I will die in the attempt.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.328
I am Thomas Wintour.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.446
And I am willing to die for
the One True Faith.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.080
I am Jack Wright.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.128
I place my life to this enterprise.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.931
JACK:
May God bless us.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.610
I am Thomas Percy.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.929
I will give everything I have...

21:52.560 --> 21:54.324
my fortune and my life

21:54.360 --> 21:56.283
to see the tyrant gone.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.171
I've changed my name
as often as I have my coat.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.043
Lately I'm called John Johnson.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.729
Will you swear, sir, as we have,
each of us?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.444
God knows I'm His servant.

22:25.280 --> 22:26.964
He's heard a thousand times

22:27.760 --> 22:29.728
all He needs to hear
from me.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.331
I have not heard it.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.728
I make the same oath as you.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.726
And to the same end.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.884
DOOR OPENS

23:22.080 --> 23:23.809
You will all have heard
of Father Gerard.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.562
A more staunch defender
of the faith you will not find.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.090
He now stands with us.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.528
Lord, govern and protect
these men

23:49.560 --> 23:50.846
in their holy work.

23:51.320 --> 23:54.324
We ask this in the name of
our one and only

23:54.360 --> 23:56.806
Lord and Saviour,
Jesus Christ.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.365
Amen.
- ALL: Amen.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.528
CECIL: ...no cause to question
the veracity of my sources...

24:04.560 --> 24:06.130
You overreached yourself,
My Lord Cecil.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.525
You are distracting the King!

24:08.760 --> 24:13.209
I shall not choose between
one course and the other.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.131
I say I shall have both
the good

24:17.160 --> 24:18.730
and necessary laws

24:18.760 --> 24:20.728
to keep the Catholics
in their place

24:21.400 --> 24:24.051
and my treaty with Spain.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.730
Though I was promised both.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.681
Was I not?

24:30.480 --> 24:33.086
Aye, I was promised as much,
Master Secretary.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.567
Your foolishness
has tangled us up.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.002
If you have not undone
the knot by the time

24:41.040 --> 24:42.644
I open the Parliament

24:43.040 --> 24:44.929
I will find one who can.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.686
Ah, the Constable.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.688
He seeks to play me.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.968
How could I be so deluded?

25:07.040 --> 25:09.168
He intended his despatch to be read.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.006
To what purpose?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.803
For the very purpose
he has now achieved.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.729
He has discredited me
in the eyes of the King

25:15.760 --> 25:17.649
who now thinks he can do
without me.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.005
If I am removed

25:20.680 --> 25:22.648
Spain will outwit our negotiators

25:22.680 --> 25:25.206
and have terms
all to their advantage.

25:27.040 --> 25:30.408
Go you privately to the Constable.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.167
If I were to be seen with
the Constable

25:33.200 --> 25:34.690
our enemies would cry treason.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.324
Then take pains to ensure
you are unseen.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.042
Tell the Constable
I am desirous

25:42.080 --> 25:44.242
of having private
conference with him

25:44.280 --> 25:46.647
at his earliest convenience.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.362
CECIL:
My master will not countenance

26:11.400 --> 26:14.165
that the laws against
the Papists be put aside.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.168
Then the treaty must fail.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.125
I say it must not.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.331
We both...

26:21.640 --> 26:23.802
Spain and England,
you and I

26:23.840 --> 26:25.490
have need of this treaty.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.205
You have in mind
some compensation, sir?

26:30.960 --> 26:33.964
Your ships, when they
venture into our waters

26:34.000 --> 26:35.968
are attacked and often
destroyed.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.441
We would allow your vessels

26:37.480 --> 26:39.244
not only free access
to the Channel

26:39.280 --> 26:43.126
but use of our seaports
to refit, shelter

26:43.160 --> 26:44.924
and buy provisions.

26:44.960 --> 26:45.961
Merchantmen?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.889
And... warships.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.767
This is something Spain
has proposed many times before.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.723
We have always been refused.

26:56.760 --> 26:59.684
This time, sir, I can ensure
it is agreed.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.166
However, in return for
these articles

27:02.960 --> 27:05.201
Spain must renounce her claim

27:05.240 --> 27:07.322
to protect the Catholics
of England.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.202
I understand the King
lately has occasion

27:13.240 --> 27:15.925
to be displeased with you,
My Lord.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.242
How may you be certain
of these articles?

27:21.440 --> 27:23.886
The little game you devised, sir

27:24.000 --> 27:26.890
has indeed placed me in a
difficult position.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.249
But I know the King

27:29.280 --> 27:33.524
and will recover the trust
that you hoodwinked from him.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.730
However, I shall have
to bring him something.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.924
What do you have in mind?

27:46.320 --> 27:48.402
It will have to be generous.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.521
RIVER WATER FLOWS

28:08.680 --> 28:10.205
Sweet Catherine.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.965
I am near you.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.125
Very near.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.922
He knows?
- Aye.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.326
TOM:
Digby.

28:36.320 --> 28:37.606
DIGBY:
Catesby.

28:39.560 --> 28:40.846
You will stand with us?

28:40.880 --> 28:42.211
To the end.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.091
How many men can you raise?

28:49.120 --> 28:50.770
Twenty of my own household.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.041
Another fifty working
and living on my lands.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.284
They are loyal to the True Church

28:55.320 --> 28:56.685
and will follow where I lead.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.087
My brother Robert has
promised us thirty men more.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.603
Rookwood, Keyes and Grant.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.810
They say they can muster
another twenty each.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.446
Wright has sworn his brother Kit
to our cause also.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.130
One Tuesday next,
the King

29:11.160 --> 29:13.766
his councillors,
all the commons and the lords

29:13.800 --> 29:15.211
will be utterly obliterated.

29:15.240 --> 29:17.242
Our army will march on
Coombe Abbey.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.647
We will seize the King's daughter,
the Princess Elizabeth.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.603
We will place the child
upon the throne.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.085
Northumberland shall be
Lord Protector.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.645
Northumberland has joined us?

29:24.680 --> 29:25.966
Percy is his kinsman

29:26.000 --> 29:28.162
and is confident that
once we strike the blow

29:28.920 --> 29:30.729
Northumberland
will take up his sword.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.444
And while the Earl leads...

29:38.800 --> 29:42.327
England's Catholics
will rise up as one man.

29:43.600 --> 29:46.490
We will sweep aside
this heretic tyranny

29:46.520 --> 29:49.603
and restore the England
of happier times.

29:59.440 --> 30:01.124
DOOR OPENS

30:23.000 --> 30:24.923
How long have you slept
in this bed?

30:30.600 --> 30:31.931
'SCI

30:33.520 --> 30:35.329
Since Christmas last.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.884
Who told you you could sleep in here?

30:40.920 --> 30:41.887
My grandmother, sir.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.524
She had no right.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.248
This is the bed in which
your mother died.

30:49.560 --> 30:52.211
I'm sorry, sir.
Please forgive me.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.450
HE WHISPERS
Forgive me?

31:00.680 --> 31:02.603
Forgive me?

31:11.200 --> 31:12.725
Forgive me, Robert.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.202
I have not been the man
I should have been.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.803
I have not been the father
you deserve.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.046
'SCI

31:25.920 --> 31:27.729
I have not known how.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.605
For my absence.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.566
For not binding myself to you

31:36.600 --> 31:37.761
with all my strength

31:37.800 --> 31:40.121
or loving you with a
heart that's full

31:40.160 --> 31:41.446
and open as your own

31:41.480 --> 31:43.050
can you forgive me?

31:51.760 --> 31:53.888
ROBERT SIGHS

32:05.840 --> 32:08.411
You have so much
of your mother in you.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.044
She would have taught me
how to hold you.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.570
How to protect you.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.443
That is all I have ever wanted.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.644
To see you safe

32:21.200 --> 32:23.407
and happy to see
you prosper.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.530
All that I do...

32:31.320 --> 32:32.731
and all that I am...

32:35.200 --> 32:37.009
the good and the bad...

32:38.960 --> 32:40.644
all is to that end.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.962
Remember this in days to come.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.606
Promise me.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.369
I do promise, Father.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.689
HORSE NEIGHS

34:11.080 --> 34:13.242
This chamber is very
ill-favoured.

34:14.199 --> 34:16.009
Ill-favoured, indeed.

34:16.600 --> 34:20.002
Thus perfectly well-fitted
for those who gather here.

34:21.400 --> 34:24.768
For they are a disorderly
and unseemly lot

34:51.440 --> 34:53.806

king governs.

34:54.679 --> 34:57.331
You will see the Parliament men

34:57.360 --> 35:00.284

and the lords

35:00.320 --> 35:02.561

There is clear passage to the river

35:19.280 --> 35:20.645

35:20.680 --> 35:22.921
Aye, by the Parliament stairs.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.008
My servant, John Johnson.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.246
I shall take it.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.487
I'm afraid that's still
not possible, sir.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.409
I've already agreed
the lease of it.

35:39.920 --> 35:40.887
Break it.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.362
I shall £4 for the lease.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.607
My husband's brother,
he's a coal merchant

35:45.640 --> 35:47.290
and has the most urgent

35:47.320 --> 35:49.800
I say I shall take it,
Mistress Whinniard

35:49.840 --> 35:52.889
on behalf of my patron,
the Earl of Northumberland.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.565

35:58.200 --> 36:01.329

37:03.800 --> 37:05.723
They ascended the stairs
to the private rooms.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.044
They had their hats pulled
low around the faces

37:08.080 --> 37:10.162
but I recognised three
of their number.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.406
Who did you see.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.805
My Lord, I did see
Robert Catesby

37:12.840 --> 37:14.490
Thomas Wintour and Jack Wright.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.963
Did you hear anything
of their conference?

37:17.000 --> 37:18.206
Very little, sir.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.924
They went to their room
as soon as they entered.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.891
They are still there?
- As last I saw.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.002
I came straight
to Sir William Wade.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.371
I was promised payment!

37:26.400 --> 37:27.811
Pay him half rate.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.330
Bring me Catesby,
Sir William.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.281
Northumberland.

37:37.760 --> 37:38.921
Is he with us?

37:40.040 --> 37:41.883
The Earl is a cautious man

37:42.280 --> 37:43.406
but I know my kinsman.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.651
Once the deed is done

37:45.680 --> 37:47.808
he will step forward
to lead our cause.

37:47.840 --> 37:50.571
And the powder?
- We shall need 3,000 pound.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.601

37:52.920 --> 37:54.126

37:57.920 --> 37:59.251
That'll take too long.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.929
