00:06.005 --> 00:07.966
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:15.181 --> 00:18.309
They say that in the fashion world
only appearances matter...

00:18.393 --> 00:21.104
...colors, textures, shapes.

00:21.938 --> 00:26.317
Beauty is a covering.
A mask that protects us from ourselves.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.864
Since my mother Inés died,
I've learned to wear that mask.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.866
I've made it my best friend.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.913
On nights like this, I miss her the most.

00:40.790 --> 00:44.085
I've done this hundreds of times,
but tonight is different.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.464
Tonight my brand's future is at stake.
So is my name.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.223
What do I do?

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
-Mom, what do I do?
-Take it off.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.271
-Here?
-Yes, there's no time, take it off.

01:03.354 --> 01:06.107
That's Elena, my daughter, my only love.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.358
-Make the zipper stronger.
-Done.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.070
Do it again, I want her
to walk down the catwalk easily.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.362
-OK.
-Your dad's here.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.449
Tonight is her first runway show.
I'm more nervous than she is.

01:14.532 --> 01:18.453
Put lotion all over your body.
They can tell, really, trust me.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.998
-What do I tell your dad?
-I want to see her with the shoes on.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.418
The dress she's wearing
is inspired in my mother's work.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.212
She never met her.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.714
Good evening, everyone!

01:29.798 --> 01:32.342
He's Lorenzo,
my business associate and my father.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.052
Enchanté  to meet you, Edha.

01:34.135 --> 01:38.056
There's André, come here... André, Edha.

01:38.139 --> 01:41.518
Every comment, every gesture,
everything is planned.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.854
I design, he sells. The rules are clear.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.983
According to my father,
salvation lies in these guys' hands.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.237
I should smile at them,
at least a little.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.826
That's Paloma, my main competitor.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.204
That isn't even her real name.
Everything about her is fake.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.580
But what is real here?

02:04.207 --> 02:08.336
Aníbal has been with us since forever.
He carries stuff.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.381
Bring me the shoes
from the silver suitcase. Come on!

02:12.340 --> 02:14.717
My father has a soft spot for him.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.928
Please, take the investors
for a drink. Now.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.597
-Get Paloma out of there.
-That's not what we agreed.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.433
Honey, putting this together wasn't free.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.770
-We're broke, please understand.
-Don't talk business right now.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.272
I need to focus.

02:27.730 --> 02:31.734
Antonio, my only friend,
is my right hand and creative partner.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.405
I'd marry him,
but he already has a husband, Ronnie.

02:43.621 --> 02:46.624
In here everything looks perfect,
beautiful, unique.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.545
But some things are hidden between the
seams and others we choose not to see.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.757
Do you have it or not?

02:54.841 --> 02:57.719
We're swamped, brother,
I couldn't finish your stuff.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.805
-How much merchandise are we short?
-Half.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.977
-I have to deliver it today.
-It's all I could get.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.021
You'll have the rest.

03:08.104 --> 03:11.983
Medina let me pay off my debt with clothes
because he knows I've got no other way.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.943
He won't take half. You don't know him.

03:18.197 --> 03:21.200
-It's been a while since I've been here.
-Yeah.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.952
How many people do you have here?

03:23.995 --> 03:25.121
It's dangerous.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.916
Dangerous is your business with Medina.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.169
Make do with that.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.298
Sorry, I tripped.
There are too many people here.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.636
-Tell her the truth.
-Shut up.

03:39.719 --> 03:43.056
-What are you doing here?
-It was me. I came to help--

03:43.139 --> 03:45.892
-You clearly can't help! Get out!
-Wait outside.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.146
You want me to bring the other one?

03:50.230 --> 03:53.274
-It's a unique piece! What other one?
-It's all right. Calm down.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.526
Calm down? It's over. Call it off.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.487
What? Edha.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.488
Edha!

03:58.571 --> 04:01.032
I'm not designing another dress
for my daughter.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.375
There it is.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.215
What are you doing here?
You couldn't get anyone else?

04:18.758 --> 04:22.637
-Celia, go home.
-No. Shall we?

04:25.139 --> 04:26.266
You're a lifesaver.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.352
That's what brothers are for.

04:30.311 --> 04:34.565
Come here with me. A proper job, a future.

04:34.899 --> 04:38.152
-A future? In there?
-Hey!

04:49.539 --> 04:53.418
We've been together for a long time and
still you didn't say anything to Manito.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.128
If he catches us, it'll be worse.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.840
-I can't, Celia.
-You have to talk to your brother.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.593
-Shall I tell him?
-I can't tell him we're together.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.929
Especially not today.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.350
I haven't got the batch for Medina.
I'm missing half.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.978
You know what they did to that kid?

05:12.770 --> 05:16.107
Did you tell Manito?
Did you tell him how much you needed?

05:16.190 --> 05:18.026
Yeah, but they're working flat out.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.154
That's all they could get.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.575
-I'm going with you.
-Are you crazy?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.870
You drop me there, and leave.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.914
You're scared.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.322
Have a great time.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.252
-What do I do?
-Let me see you.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.495
Trust me, love.
Everything will be all right.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.837
What do you think?

07:05.758 --> 07:06.843
I love it.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.124
Bravo, Elena. Bravo!

08:04.233 --> 08:06.027
-What is Jáuregui doing here?
-What?

08:06.110 --> 08:07.570
My dad, who invited him?

08:07.904 --> 08:08.738
I don't know.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.699
Don't talk on the runway,
people are watching.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.211
There's merchandise missing here--

08:23.294 --> 08:25.796
-We agreed to two parts.
-We didn't agree anything.

08:26.130 --> 08:30.384
-You forgot. This is the first part--
-That's not what you told me.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.054
You'll have the rest.
You know I'm good for it.

08:33.137 --> 08:36.349
No, you're not.
You're screwing with me, I don't like it.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.560
Keep your word or fight.
Are you in my weight class?

08:40.186 --> 08:42.230
Don't fuck around or I'll break your legs.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.233
-It's all right.
-No, it's not all right, it's bad.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.945
In this country,
we don't like being screwed.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.572
Now scram, before I want to fuck you.

08:55.660 --> 08:59.080
-Why didn't you tell me Jáuregui was here?
-Because I didn't know.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.041
You were amazing.
Don't let it ruin your night.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.585
Oops, sorry.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.258
-Hello.
-Hello.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.593
Congratulations.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.805
Thank you.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.599
I came to see you, exclusively.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.185
-OK.
-I loved it.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.438
You're beautiful, Elena.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.110
Shall we have dinner tonight?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.823
-I'm with Mom.
-Well, tomorrow perhaps.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.199
-Or maybe--
-We'll see.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.369
It's very aggressive of you,
turning up here.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.038
Aggressive is going to a public event
to see my daughter.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.498
She has to change.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.084
Elena, I don't know
what your mother's told you...

09:46.252 --> 09:49.130
-...but you're not a girl anymore.
-Obviously not.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.341
The danger is no longer
falling out of bed.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.970
You missed all that.
Now there are other dangers.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.680
Men like you, for instance.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.852
It would be good
to create your own version.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.646
-Are you done?
-Elena is my daughter too.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.818
-I'll get her back.
-You can't get back what was never yours.

10:12.903 --> 10:13.946
We'll see.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.240
Goodbye, Elena.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.118
-Bye.
-I'll call you.

10:37.887 --> 10:41.015
Are you interested in a T-shirt?
It's good quality! No?

10:41.849 --> 10:43.184
Good quality.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.378
And the flowers?

11:10.961 --> 11:12.213
In the car.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.173
-I didn't see them.
-In the trunk.

11:14.673 --> 11:15.966
You want them now, Ele?

11:17.343 --> 11:18.844
They'll wilt in there.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.519
I'll be right back, you can start.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.028
Stop, stop! Don't move, OK?

11:39.281 --> 11:41.200
-Where are you from, dude?
-From here!

11:41.992 --> 11:44.286
-Is that so?
-I have residency, look at my ID.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.083
-Another rat come to steal from us.
-I'm working.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.584
Why did you run then?

11:51.252 --> 11:53.421
-I got scared. It's complicated.
-You're complicated.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.423
Turn around and open your bag.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.593
-Open your bag.
-Don't move.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.265
They're T-shirts, good quality stuff,
good stitching.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.185
Want one for your wife? I live off this.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.603
Your size.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.231
We have to take you in for illegal sales.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.360
-Where did you get these?
-From a factory.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.238
We can sort this.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.700
Scram. Out of my sight, rat.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.910
Beat it!

12:25.703 --> 12:26.871
Here.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.834
What you do is wrong. I live off this.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.628
Me too. You got off easy.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.839
Next time, you'll sleep in the station.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.966
And I'll beat you up.

12:45.973 --> 12:49.935
-You're staying for Fashion Week, right?
-We came for that actually.

12:50.019 --> 12:54.773
By the way, we love your granddaughter.
Your daughter.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.109
A young face for the brand, we're excited.

12:57.526 --> 13:01.489
Today's thing was unusual.
A special event, mothers and daughters.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.074
At Fashion Week,
you'll see something you'll like.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.785
Tell them about the concept
of the collection.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.331
Yes. It's all based on and inspired...
No, no, no.

13:10.915 --> 13:15.711
-In the fashion world, no one eats.
-If it has eyes, I don't eat it.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.714
-I already ordered something for you.
-Thank you.

13:19.507 --> 13:23.052
I just sent pictures to my wife
and she loved your part.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.013
We talked to your father
about the possibility

13:26.096 --> 13:29.350
of you creating an export sample,
about 500 garments

13:29.433 --> 13:31.143
in parallel to Fashion Week.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.479
The idea is to adapt them, of course.

13:33.562 --> 13:37.191
We'll keep the concept, the design,
and think about the production scale.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.445
"Adapt" is something
I'm not accustomed to do.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.156
It will be ready by next week.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.491
Excuse me.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.120
We don't doubt her artistic capacity,
not at all.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.790
We want to confirm
her production capacity.

13:59.338 --> 14:03.592
-Edha, what are you doing out here?
-I was suffocating in there. I need air.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.470
And we need them. That's why we're here.

14:06.554 --> 14:10.266
I can't talk business or charm anyone.
I've done my part. It's your turn.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.560
-I can't do any more.
-What were you thinking?

14:12.643 --> 14:15.604
What were you thinking?
Do you know what day it is?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.733
It's 20 years since my mother
committed suicide.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.193
Your wife, remember?

14:24.530 --> 14:27.199
-I miss her too.
-You're lucky then.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.034
I barely remember her.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.204
She was my age when she died.

14:33.998 --> 14:38.294
We need partners, Edha. Capital.
That's how this works. We're broke.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.629
Please, let's go back to the table--

14:40.713 --> 14:43.090
-I don't need anything.
-What is it?

14:43.173 --> 14:45.926
-They're leaving.
-We'll do the sample all the same.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.137
-They don't want it.
-Do it!

14:54.226 --> 14:56.896
From one day to the next,
we become insects.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.231
It's never one day to the next.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.623
-He won't come?
-No.

15:35.851 --> 15:36.936
Get the dog out.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.480
The dog won't tell Manito. Keep going.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.486
And you? When are you going to tell him?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.406
Not yet. Where will I get what I owe?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.367
Manito won't stop giving you clothes.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.160
If I don't pay, Medina will kill me.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.245
Do you want me killed?

15:56.413 --> 15:58.123
We can't keep hiding like this.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.723
-Get the dog out.
-OK.

16:20.938 --> 16:24.441
Board up the window.
No one can see what we do.

16:25.859 --> 16:29.822
I need tools to fix that, Manito.
It's impossible without tools.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.701
Even I could do it with tools.
Anyone could.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.623
We're already on it. Little by little,
we're fixing the factory.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.960
Have you been going out?

16:43.627 --> 16:45.587
No, no one goes out.

16:45.671 --> 16:49.383
Anyone been asking questions outside?
I think the factory's being watched.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.093
I haven't seen anything strange.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.470
-You, Ismael?
-No.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.224
This isn't a hotel
for people to come and go.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.728
No one can know we have
a working factory here.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.980
Aníbal, I know how to handle it.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.189
You sure?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.150
I wasn't born yesterday.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.529
Watch it. I'm going up.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.366
Let's take this upstairs.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.638
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in school?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.849
I felt really sick, so I stayed.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.518
-Do you want me to stay?
-No.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.730
Your dad's flowers are nice.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.609
Call me if you need anything.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.527
I love you.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.798
ELENA, IT'S ME, DAD. LET'S TALK?

18:16.678 --> 18:17.930
SAVE

18:22.684 --> 18:27.731
We need to produce the samples
to persuade the investors. We need money.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.279
We'll sell your mother's work,
and you're going to help me.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.782
Odette won't agree. The work is hers too.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.909
We'll have to try.

18:40.410 --> 18:43.163
I haven't seen her for years. Well...

18:44.248 --> 18:46.750
Everyone's needs change at some point.

18:47.251 --> 18:52.089
Odette was my mother's shadow,
her alter ego, her artistic partner.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.884
Since Inés's death, I stopped seeing her.
I distanced myself...

18:56.552 --> 18:57.386
...until today.

18:57.469 --> 19:02.766
...a totally mediocre artist
who thought he'd invented Land Art.

19:02.850 --> 19:06.145
-I know him.
-A copycat but he made a fortune.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.273
I still think the same.

19:09.356 --> 19:13.986
All artists care about is money,
they're all crooks. Except my daughter.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.321
Thanks for that deference.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.699
Your father's always been
a total pragmatist.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.367
Do you know his story?

19:20.659 --> 19:23.162
Yes, a son of immigrants, poor,

19:23.245 --> 19:25.581
skilled in business,
intuitive with horses,

19:25.664 --> 19:29.293
an important businessman, wealthy.
At least until now.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.045
Yes, but now I'm broke
and it's not metaphorical.

19:32.462 --> 19:33.505
I need to sell.

19:34.298 --> 19:37.885
-At least half the series.
-I can't think about that right now.

19:37.968 --> 19:41.180
-We'll talk after the exhibition.
-I can't wait.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.681
I don't know, ten pieces.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.352
You'll have to learn to wait.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.981
Money isn't more important
than my inspiration.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.609
-Fucking bitch!
-Let us talk alone.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.196
I'll wait in the car.

19:59.656 --> 20:02.451
That collection
is your mother's best work.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.245
You've never seen that collection.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.421
I don't like it, I don't want to see it.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.132
Don't like it or don't want to see it?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.383
Both.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.761
How can you sell something you don't know?

20:21.303 --> 20:23.388
You have to see this before you decide.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.272
Now you can decide.

20:38.695 --> 20:41.073
I'll give you this one.
Half's already yours.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.825
I want you and Lorenzo
to be at my inauguration.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.786
There's no art without you two.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.204
We'll talk more later.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.630
Mom!

21:39.131 --> 21:40.132
What are you doing?

21:45.012 --> 21:46.305
It's all right.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.597
It's nothing, darling.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.858
-Where's Celia?
-How should I know?

21:57.941 --> 21:59.484
We're not talking about Celia.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.361
Don't involve her in your business.

22:02.070 --> 22:05.240
She was looking at me yesterday.
I think she has feelings for me.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.743
It's blue. Blue.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.412
Listen to me and get a job.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.957
Try to be someone, ever think about that?

22:14.750 --> 22:17.085
-No.
-You should.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.672
Come to cutting, you'd do well.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.759
I'm not working here.

22:24.718 --> 22:25.761
-No?
-No.

22:25.844 --> 22:30.265
But with a gun in your hand you do?
Do whatever the fuck you want!

22:30.348 --> 22:32.768
-I won't look after you.
-I look after you.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.606
-Does Celia know you came?
-Shut up about Celia.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.401
-I'm the foreman, we're not at home.
-Fuck home!

22:43.403 --> 22:46.740
I can't be with Celia at home
because of my brother

22:46.823 --> 22:48.909
who doesn't want to see
that we're together.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.911
Well, Celia and me have had enough!

22:52.370 --> 22:54.664
We're together. Is that clear?

23:06.009 --> 23:08.345
What the fuck are you looking at?
Keep sewing!

23:09.554 --> 23:11.306
The engine overheated.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.059
Turn on the fan, it's there for a reason!

23:29.908 --> 23:31.409
All this for you.

23:33.411 --> 23:34.788
-Dad?
-Hmm?

23:34.871 --> 23:37.707
Can you give me a doctor's note
for school?

23:37.791 --> 23:41.461
I want to go on one of those
cooking shows, I love them.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.046
-So trashy.
-You watch them!

23:43.130 --> 23:44.798
-That's not true.
-I saw you!

23:44.881 --> 23:47.676
Old people watch TV.
Will you write me a note?

23:47.759 --> 23:49.052
I can't right now.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.763
Sebi's here. Let's go.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.809
-Give me one, I'll fill it in.
-I can't do that.

23:56.476 --> 23:59.020
-Wait, don't go without tasting it!
-Sebi's here!

23:59.604 --> 24:02.232
He gets here and you go?
You don't do that with me.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.650
With you?

24:04.359 --> 24:06.903
-I'll try it.
-Very well! Give me the plate.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.616
-I can't eat all that.
-Share it with Delfi.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.452
-And the plate?
-The house can take the loss.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.205
OK, I'll bring it back.

24:30.552 --> 24:35.223
-How could you do this to me?
-I love you, but in a different way.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.810
Either you love someone
or you don't, Celia.

24:38.894 --> 24:42.230
-You cheated on me with my brother!
-I didn't cheat on you.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.732
-No?
-No!

24:43.815 --> 24:47.903
It's a long time since we were together,
you've got to find somebody new.

24:48.486 --> 24:51.489
I thought you were playing hard to get,
you used me.

24:56.244 --> 24:57.746
Where are you going? Hey!

24:58.830 --> 25:00.957
You'll stir shit up. Don't!

25:15.055 --> 25:17.933
-Why did you tell him like that?
-That's how it came out.

25:20.435 --> 25:23.813
Give that fucking dog to Medina.
I'm not giving you any more clothes.

25:27.192 --> 25:30.612
I did so many things for you,
things that no one does.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.907
-What did you do for Celia?
-Leave him to me!

25:33.990 --> 25:35.700
What did you do for her? Talk.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.752
Ask her. She can tell you.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.509
You can both forget about Manito...
Forever.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.805
I'm dead to you now.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.358
He'll get over it--

26:08.441 --> 26:10.652
You don't know Manito,
he won't forgive me.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.737
Without him, I have no clothes.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.248
Hi, love.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.959
-Elena!
-What is it?

26:26.042 --> 26:27.460
I want to show you something.

26:29.713 --> 26:30.839
What is it?

26:32.090 --> 26:34.384
One of Inés's last works.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.764
Look!

26:46.146 --> 26:48.481
Isn't that the dress
I wore for the runway?

26:48.565 --> 26:49.816
This was my inspiration.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.779
What is it? What are you thinking?

26:56.031 --> 26:58.658
-Do you think I should see him?
-Who?

26:58.742 --> 26:59.617
My dad.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.997
-Is it OK if I see him?
-No... It won't do you any good.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.129
That's all. The phases are all balanced.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.923
I put in a 380 switchboard. All top class.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.719
Are you OK?

27:18.845 --> 27:19.846
Yes.

27:20.889 --> 27:24.017
Are you stupid? We need to be alert!

27:24.809 --> 27:28.855
I just saw a suspicious car outside.
Let's do things right.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.524
We all have a job to do.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.526
Are we all good?

27:35.737 --> 27:37.906
-We're good.
-Good.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.797
A district attorney
is ordering you to do it.

27:54.839 --> 27:59.177
No. Take care of the ruling,
and find out Judge Mirolli's sentence.

28:00.011 --> 28:03.681
Perfect, but until he announces
the sentence, don't move forward.

28:03.765 --> 28:07.227
And don't forget about the reports
on the sweatshops, 8th district.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.646
OK? See you
at the attorney general's office.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.694
Hi, love. I got your message.
I'll bring the diapers.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.072
I'm coming, I haven't smoked all day.

28:25.995 --> 28:28.581
-Do you need something?
-No, no.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.585
Watch out, at night it gets heavy here.
There are thieves.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.564
Sometimes, seeing what
you don't want to see

28:52.647 --> 28:57.110
opens your eyes
to what you actually need to do.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.115
Inés still shows me the way
through her artwork.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.327
Lorenzo, I know what I have to do now.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.208
Call the investors.

29:12.292 --> 29:15.378
We'll do what they asked,
but we'll do it my way.

29:22.218 --> 29:26.347
-Medina?
-He's inside, go look for him. Go on.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.491
How are you, baby?

29:45.825 --> 29:47.452
I'm late with your money.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.746
I'm good for it, you know.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.124
I heard the cops caught you with clothes.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.376
A couple of T-shirts to get by.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.504
I hear you've been telling the cops stuff.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.005
Was that to get by?

29:59.547 --> 30:00.673
What did I say?

30:02.008 --> 30:03.092
"Medina."

30:03.176 --> 30:05.929
When the cops leaned on you,
you said, "Medina."

30:06.012 --> 30:07.430
No, I didn't say that.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.850
Really?

30:10.934 --> 30:13.978
I don't know you.
That's not how it works.

30:15.021 --> 30:16.898
Did he say "Medina" or not?

30:21.694 --> 30:22.695
Yes, he said it.

30:24.405 --> 30:25.406
I didn't say it.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.452
No one says my name.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.288
Like those who can't name God? The Jews.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.917
They can use other names,
but they can't say "God."

30:36.000 --> 30:37.836
Don't bust my balls, Medina.

30:37.919 --> 30:41.214
Tell me if you can wait
for the payment or not.

30:41.297 --> 30:42.549
But I didn't say it.

30:43.883 --> 30:45.343
You're screwing me around.

30:45.635 --> 30:49.097
You're ungrateful
and you're disrespecting me.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.516
You're lucky you have a nice ass.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.942
They cut out your tongue?

31:16.291 --> 31:18.334
Where are you? Shall I wait inside?

31:18.418 --> 31:19.919
I'm still working.

31:20.003 --> 31:22.547
We promised the investors
more than we can make.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.883
Seriously? I want you here with me.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.176
Can't Florencia go?

31:27.260 --> 31:29.888
-No, she can't.
-I can't believe you're not coming.

31:40.690 --> 31:41.900
Antonio isn't coming.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.777
You're with me.
You don't need anybody else.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.031
Everyone is so dreadfully dressed.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.368
It's starting.

31:53.786 --> 31:56.122
Now I talk Odette into selling Mom's work.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.344
I need everybody at work.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.679
Here, resting, sleeping, I don't care.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.349
Bring everyone. You know
how important this job is?

32:15.141 --> 32:17.101
Have you seen the state of this factory?

32:17.185 --> 32:21.481
-It's packed. It's not big enough.
-So you're an engineer now?

32:22.023 --> 32:25.610
Do whatever it takes. Cut the shifts,
get more people, get more machines,

32:25.693 --> 32:26.819
whatever it takes.

32:27.528 --> 32:28.863
Have you been drinking?

32:29.864 --> 32:31.199
Have you been drinking?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.083
What is it?

32:41.167 --> 32:42.377
Go on. Work.

33:46.941 --> 33:50.319
To Odette, art and life
were a single entity.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.697
She conceived her body
as part of her work.

33:53.281 --> 33:57.910
She put it at risk and danced with death.
She pushed it to its breaking point.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.831
Being close to her is like
being close to my mother...

34:02.331 --> 34:03.541
...and to her death.

34:24.353 --> 34:27.940
This is not art. This time is real.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.234
Odette killed herself.

34:31.069 --> 34:35.948
There's nothing beautiful in this death.
It's cold and cruel, like my mother's.

34:37.200 --> 34:42.080
I know she wanted me to see it,
to be there, to witness her suicide.

34:43.539 --> 34:44.916
Why?

35:09.816 --> 35:13.486
We're in a hurry. OK, OK, OK.

35:17.448 --> 35:20.952
"Your money isn't more important than
my inspiration," she said.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.203
She wanted you there.

35:22.662 --> 35:25.331
Odette thought out her work in advance,
she set it up.

35:25.998 --> 35:29.710
-"Work"? She killed herself.
-Without us, her work had no meaning.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.130
What do you mean?

35:32.839 --> 35:36.092
I'm saying that there's a message for us
in what we saw.

35:36.926 --> 35:41.347
With her artwork, the only thing she did
was make us relive your mother's death.

35:41.430 --> 35:44.725
And she prohibited us from selling
her work. There's your message.

35:45.059 --> 35:47.728
Everyone's busy.
The new stuff will have to wait.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.231
No way, Antonio.
We have to get to Fashion Week.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.608
What we had was good.
There's no time to innovate.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.111
We promised a capsule to the investors.

35:55.194 --> 35:58.614
The usual factories are swamped.
The new ones won't finance us.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.868
Let's move forward however we can,
Antonio.

36:01.951 --> 36:05.454
Please take her out of the house.
I don't want her locked in here again.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.460
We'll do it here.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.337
-What?
-The factory.

36:15.256 --> 36:18.593
The capsule collection is inspired
by Inés. Where better than here?

36:19.760 --> 36:22.096
You'll have to talk to your dad first.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.932
Don't you think I'm too old
to ask my dad for permission?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.684
There are things you don't know.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.019
What things?

36:30.104 --> 36:32.356
The sweatshop that burned down
worked for us.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.900
FIRE IN SWEATSHOP

36:55.671 --> 36:57.798
Manuel Zuñiga, is he your brother?

37:04.347 --> 37:07.558
That's not my brother.
It's what's left of him.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.400
Let's go.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.444
Hey, you!

37:19.403 --> 37:20.780
-Hey!
-Teo. Teo!

37:21.822 --> 37:25.368
-You're leaving without saying a word?
-What do you want me to say?

37:25.451 --> 37:27.370
-That you'll take responsibility.
-What?

37:27.453 --> 37:29.455
You brother was boss, look what happened.

37:29.538 --> 37:32.500
People work in these shitty sweatshops
that catch fire!

37:32.583 --> 37:34.293
-My brother was one!
-He was foreman!

37:34.377 --> 37:37.546
Stop! It's the fault of the company
that ran the sweatshop.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.842
-Who do you know in there?
-I'm supporting the locals.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.845
It's easy to blame a dead man.
That won't happen here.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.305
I'll make sure of it.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.599
Let's go.

37:50.309 --> 37:51.727
Let me through, buddy.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.836
My father always protected me
from the truth.

38:17.211 --> 38:19.964
But secrets come to light
sooner or later.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.551
Silent tragedies, anonymous deaths.

38:24.593 --> 38:28.639
People who, somewhere, lose
their lives for a label, for a brand.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.559
Until one day someone says "enough"...

38:31.976 --> 38:34.353
...and decides to cross
that invisible line,

38:34.437 --> 38:37.982
to open up the seams,
to step out of the shadows.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.202
