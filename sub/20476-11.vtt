we'll beat them to the Holotrix.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.779
Aezethril, we've got to reach
that final chamber.

14:48.780 --> 14:52.100
There is but one path left.

14:53.100 --> 14:58.099
Ah, not the Chamber of Tilisook!
I'd rather fight 100 blogwarts.

14:58.100 --> 15:01.099
I thought you were
this close to beating the game?

15:01.100 --> 15:02.100
I am.

15:02.101 --> 15:06.099
Kind of. This chamber takes
you all the way to the end.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.099
- I-I just never figured it out.
- Fear not.

15:08.100 --> 15:12.299
I will guide us through
the Riddle of Fire.

15:12.300 --> 15:16.300
Oh, yeah, for a second I forgot
we had a wizard on our side.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.099
Or maybe not.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.099
Aezethril? Can you hear us?

15:24.100 --> 15:27.099
Time's started. We only get
a minute to solve this thing.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.138
And, oh, yeah, those guys.

15:30.620 --> 15:34.807

This is why I don't play games.

- No problem.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.099
I've been stuck in this cave
so many times

15:47.100 --> 15:51.139
I can read every language
from Argdal to Zilibish.

One for the rising sun,
two for the drop.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.614
Three for the setting sun,
four for the top.

16:00.649 --> 16:02.140
Aaah!

16:07.100 --> 16:09.099
Rising and setting sun?

16:09.100 --> 16:13.800
- That could be east and west.
- Oh!

16:15.100 --> 16:18.099
Which means "top" and "drop"
are north and south.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.099
Time's almost up, Kayo.

16:20.100 --> 16:23.357

18:21.140 --> 18:23.299
It's time we finish this.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.099
- Does the Guardian have a weak spot?
- Up there.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.099
The jewel on the back of its neck.

18:28.100 --> 18:32.099
Strike there and the Guardian
shall be defeated.

18:32.100 --> 18:35.099
Go for the legs. Once it's down,
we'll attack the weak spot.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.100
Got it.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.099
Huh? It didn't work.

- Can John send you back?
- Maybe to the beginning,

18:57.940 --> 19:00.299
but you're in the final chamber
that is about to explode.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.100
No more games!
This ends now!

With mystic blades and fiery awe,
we pledge our honour best.

a noble few will pass the test.

Thank you for everything.

That didn't sound very wizardly...
Aezethril?

Call me Sylvester.
I've had enough fantasy for one day.
