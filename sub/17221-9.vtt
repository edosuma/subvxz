03:06.654 --> 03:08.789
IT IS NOT A CHRISTMAS ADVENTURE,
ALL RIGHT?

03:08.822 --> 03:11.559
EVERY YEAR ON CHRISTMAS,
I CHOOSE TO GIVE MYSELF THE GIFT

I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.

YOU ARE INVITED

03:19.433 --> 03:20.868

03:42.890 --> 03:44.358
- HOT AIR RISES.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.660
COOL AIR'S DOWN HERE HANGING

03:51.499 --> 03:53.033
WHAT IS IT WITH THESE
UNION GUYS?

03:53.066 --> 03:56.270
THEY PROTECT THIS $60 THERMOSTAT
LIKE IT'S THAT BIG DIAMOND

03:56.304 --> 03:58.539
WITH MAGICAL POWERS
IN MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.707
- IS THAT THE PLOT?

03:59.740 --> 04:00.941
- WELL, I DON'T FOLLOW THE PLOT.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.043
I JUST GO TO WATCH TOM CRUISE
RUN AROUND IN HIS MOM JEANS.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.945
SO DID THEY GIVE YOU AN ETA

04:04.978 --> 04:06.447
OF WHEN THE A/C'S
GONNA BE UP AND RUNNING?

04:06.480 --> 04:08.316
- WELL, I FILLED OUT

04:21.829 --> 04:24.532
MUST BE NAILED SHUT
DUE TO JUMPERS.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.566
- WHY DO YOU KNOW THAT?

04:25.599 --> 04:29.970
- DUDE, MY BRAIN IS A HOARDER.

04:30.003 --> 04:30.971
- UH-OH.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.806
WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND, JUDGE?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.375
- WE GOT A HIGH PROFILE CASE
WITH TOM,

04:34.408 --> 04:37.345
A HEAT WAVE, NO A/C,
HE'S GONNA OBJECT TO EVERYTHING,

04:37.378 --> 04:39.947
SWEAT THROUGH HIS SUIT,
SAY HE'S NOT HOT WHEN HE IS,

04:39.980 --> 04:42.383
SPEAK IN TONGUES,
MAYBE NOT SPEAK IN TONGUES,

04:42.416 --> 04:44.485
AND THEN DROP LIKE A DRUNK GIRL
A COACHELLA.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.388
- OH, HE HIS DEFINITELY GONNA
SPEAK IN TONGUES

04:47.421 --> 04:49.357
AND THAT'S GONNA BE
THE SWEET SPOT OF MY DAY.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.725
both: MM.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.761
- LET'S DO THIS.

[moaning]

05:03.637 --> 05:05.873
- JUDGE, YOU'RE MAKING SOME
MIGHTY PRIVATE SOUNDS THERE.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.008
- OH, TEDWARD, I FEEL LIKE I'M

YOU REALIZE I'M THE JUDGE
YOU HAVE TO STAND UP FOR.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.698
WHAT WAS IT?
HEROIN AND NUNCHUCKS?

05:30.731 --> 05:32.600
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

05:32.633 --> 05:36.504
ANYWAY, I BEAR NEITHER GRUDGES
NOR FOOLS, SO WE'RE ALL GOOD.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.873
BUT YOU DO HAVE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COURT.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.475
REGINA BULLOCK,
IT'S THE COURT'S UNDERSTANDING

05:41.509 --> 05:43.711
THAT YOU HAVE PLED "NO CONTEST"
TO CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE

ENDANGERMENT OF A CHILD,

05:46.947 --> 05:47.981
IS THAT CORRECT?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.883
- CORRECT.
- SHE HIT A KID!

05:49.917 --> 05:50.884
- OBJECTION.

05:50.918 --> 05:51.752
all: BOO!

05:51.785 --> 05:53.421
- OH, OBJECTION TO THIS.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.555
- YOU, OVER-RULED.
AND THE SAME FOR YOU.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.524
AND TO THE SHORTIES
IN THE HOUSE,

05:56.557 --> 05:57.625
THERE'S NO BOOING, OKAY?

05:57.658 --> 05:58.959
AND THERE'S NO CHEERING.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.629
AND IF YOU THINK I WON'T CITE
A KID FOR CONTEMPT,

06:01.662 --> 06:05.999
IT'S ON MY BUCKET LIST.
TRY ME.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.968
COUNSELOR, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY FOR YOU CLIENT?

06:08.001 --> 06:10.037
- ONLY THAT MRS. BULLOCK WITNESS

06:10.070 --> 06:12.606
GET FACE-MASKED BY A MUCH
LARGER CHILD.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.174
MRS. BULLOCK THEN EMBARKED
ON A BRISK WALK

06:14.207 --> 06:16.043
BEFORE GENTLY PUSHING
THE LARGER CHILD TO THE GROUND.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.813
THE CHILD, YOUR HONOR,
WHO WAS PROTECTED HEAD-TO-TOE

06:19.847 --> 06:20.648
WITH REGULATION PADS
AND A HELMET.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.716
- OBJECTION!
HE'S CHARACTERIZING--

06:22.750 --> 06:24.552
- SUSTAINED. I SAW THE VIDEO,
COUNSELOR, ALL RIGHT?

06:24.585 --> 06:26.186
NOBODY GETS 9 MILLION HITS
ON YOUTUBE

06:26.219 --> 06:27.888
FOR DOING ANYTHING "GENTLY."

06:27.921 --> 06:31.759
TEDWARD, CAN YOU PLEASE DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS HEAT?

06:34.595 --> 06:37.765
- YOU CAN HAVE MY JUICE, SIR.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.900
- FINE.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.670
OKAY, FINE. FINE.
LET THE COOLER IN.

06:42.703 --> 06:43.737
children: YAY!

06:43.771 --> 06:45.873
- HEY, JUDGE.
- HEY JUDY.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.207
- I'M IN CHARGE OF SECRET
SANTAS.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.075
TEDWARD ASKED ME.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.777
SAID HE WANTED
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO GO

06:49.810 --> 06:51.812
TO SOMEONE HE FINDS ATTRACTIVE,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH--

06:51.845 --> 06:53.747
I DON'T KNOW,
I STOPPED LISTENING.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.848
ANYWAY, HERE YOU GO.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.884
THE RULE IS YOU HAVE TO DROP OFF
YOUR GIFT TOMORROW.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.986
- NO, LOOK, IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE,
JUDY,

06:59.019 --> 07:01.154
I HAVE NO TIME TO SHOP
FOR GIFTS.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.823
- THAT'S NOT MY FAULT,
THAT'S ON TEDWARD.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.958
LOOK, THERE'S ONLY ONE SLIP
LEFT.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.595
IF YOU DON'T TAKE IT,
SOMEONE DOESN'T GET A PRESENT.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.697
NO PRESENT,
IMAGINE THE HEARTBREAK.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.566
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO RUIN
SOMEONE'S CHRISTMAS

07:12.600 --> 07:15.235
LIKE SOME SWEATY, RED-GLASSES
WEARING GRINCH? I MEAN--

07:15.268 --> 07:18.472
- ALL RIGHT! I WILL TAKE IT
IF YOU STOP TALKING.

07:20.641 --> 07:24.478
- I THINK SOMEONE'S HEART GREW
THREE SIZES JUST NOW.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.979
BUT JUDY, WHAT'S
THE SPENDING LIMIT?

07:26.013 --> 07:26.980
- $50.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.182
ALTHOUGH, YOU DO MAKE FOUR TIMES
AS MUCH AS I DO

07:29.216 --> 07:33.887
SO WHATEVER THAT MEANS TO YOU.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.756
- A LITTLE ORDER IN THE COURT
PLEASE, ALL RIGHT?

07:35.789 --> 07:36.990
FRESHEN UP, SETTLE DOWN,

07:37.024 --> 07:42.963
AND CAN YOU TOSS ME A COUPLE
OF THOSE JUICE BOXES, PLEASE.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.131
THANK YOU.

07:44.164 --> 07:47.100
- YOUR HONOR, IN THE SPIRIT
OF MOVING THINGS ALONG...

07:47.134 --> 07:48.502
- YES, COUNSELOR.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.870
GIVEN THE HEAT AND THE FACT
THAT THE DEFENSE

07:49.903 --> 07:53.173
HAS ALREADY PLED NO CONTEST,
I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET

07:53.206 --> 07:56.009
TO MRS. BULLOCK'S
PETITION FOR LENIENCY.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.845
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THE PROSECUTION

07:57.878 --> 08:00.848
WANTS TO DO A WHOLE SONG AND
DANCE ABOUT MAXIMUM SENTENCING.

08:00.881 --> 08:01.782
- OH, WE DO.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.651
100% WE WANT TO.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.918
MAXIMUM JAIL TIME.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.253
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.588
BIG FINE.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.656
DIP INTO THEIR COLLEGE FUNDS.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.825
- ALL RIGHT, COUNSELOR,
PLEASE APPROACH THE BENCH.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.795
- WHAT?

08:14.828 --> 08:15.863
- COLLEGE FUNDS, TOM.

08:15.896 --> 08:16.864
YOU NEED TO COOL OFF.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.298
WILL YOU PLEASE HAVE A JUICE?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.800
- NOT FROM MY COOLER!

08:19.833 --> 08:20.834
- DON'T NEED IT.

08:20.868 --> 08:21.969
NO HOT.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.537
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ADMIT
THAT YOU'RE AFFECTED BY THE HEAT

08:23.571 --> 08:24.538
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.873
- I'M NOT AFFECTED BY THE HEAT.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.241
THEY ARE.
THIS JURY IS PUTTY IN MY HANDS.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.812
- OH, TOM, THERE'S NO JURY,
JUST A BUNCH OF NUBBY CHAIRS

08:31.845 --> 08:33.747
WITH MYSTERY STAINS.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.917
- STEP AWAY FROM THAT
THERMOSTAT, SON.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.119
- WAYNE CAMPBELL.
LOCAL 617.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.588
LET'S SEE HERE.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.955
WELL, AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE
TO HELP YOU OUT,

08:41.989 --> 08:43.691
YOUR TOUCHPAD'S GOOD.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.759
THE TROUBLE'S WITH YOUR DIAL,
WHICH IS TECHNICALLY A KNOB.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.261
AND THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT
UNION ALTOGETHER.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.798
KNOBS AND DIALS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT,

08:50.831 --> 08:51.865
THAT'S DANTE.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.601
IF YOU SEE HIM,
WHEN YOU SEE HIM,

08:53.634 --> 08:55.669
PLEASE TELL HIM
OF OUR SUFFERING.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.705
- YES, MA'AM.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.075
- IT'S HOT, THEY SAY.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.744
BUT I AM NOT HOT.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.079
- [groans]

09:06.113 --> 09:07.615
- COME WITH ME.
LET'S IMAGINE--

09:07.648 --> 09:08.982
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
RELEVANCE.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.250
SUSTAINED.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.586
TOM, GET TO THE D.A.'S
RECOMMENDATION, PLEASE.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.922
- LET'S IMAGINE OURSELVES
IN A DEPRESSION-ERA

09:14.955 --> 09:16.323
MISSISSIPPI COURTROOM.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.158
- I'D RATHER NOT.

09:18.191 --> 09:18.992
- LOOK, GO DOWN TO THE BASEMENT.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.828
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
THIS DANTE GUY,

09:20.861 --> 09:23.631
- I'D RATHER NOT DO THAT EITHER.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.165
OH, I SEE. OKAY.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.134
YOU'RE BRINGING OUT THE LOOK.

09:27.167 --> 09:31.772
- AND THIS MOTHER GUY
IS A CHILD MISDANGERER.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.774
ENDANGEROUS.
MISDANGERMENT.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.275
- OKAY, HE CALLED ME
A MOTHER GUY.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.644
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT?

09:36.677 --> 09:38.311
- I GET EVERYTHING.
I DON'T EVEN TRY.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.747
ALL RIGHT,
THE DISTRICT TURTTORNEY

09:39.780 --> 09:40.881
NEEDS A LITTLE TAIL TIME.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.015
- OOPS, YOU LOST ME.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.383
AND SPEAKING IN TONGUES, CHECK.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.786
TOM, IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR ME,
DON'T HIT YOUR HEAD

09:45.819 --> 09:47.821
ON THE WAY DOWN.

09:47.855 --> 09:48.922
HE'S DOWN.

09:54.061 --> 09:54.261
.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.395
- TEDWARD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE BASEMENT.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.631
- YOU KNOW WHAT, JUDGE,
I AM NOT AFRAID

09:57.665 --> 09:59.232
OF BASEMENTS, OKAY?

09:59.266 --> 10:02.102
I DO NOT LIKE BASEMENTS 'CAUSE
THEY'RE HOTBEDS FOR MURDER

10:02.135 --> 10:03.837
AND THE OCCULT, OKAY?

10:03.871 --> 10:05.238
AND, LOOK, LET ME TELL YOU,
IT'S NOT FEAR.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.940
THAT IS KNOWLEDGE, OKAY?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.041
THAT'S KNOWLEDGE--
YOU KNOW, HOW--

10:08.075 --> 10:09.042
AFRAID?
- OKAY.

10:09.076 --> 10:12.245
- THAT IS A POOR CHOICE
OF WORDS, YOUR HONOR.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.249
- PUT THAT THING AWAY,
IT'S A BASEMENT!

10:16.283 --> 10:18.285
- YEAH, EXACTLY!

10:20.721 --> 10:22.956
- IT'S FREEZING IN HERE!
- OH, A/C!

10:22.990 --> 10:28.295
- JUDGE JORDAN?

10:28.328 --> 10:30.330
WHAT THE--

10:34.334 --> 10:35.803
- $100 BUY-IN.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.070
- OH, WE DIDN'T COME TO PLAY.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.338
- OKAY.
OKAY.

10:38.371 --> 10:43.310
SO LET'S SEE, I SEE POKER CHIPS,
CARDS, CASH, BOOZE, GAMBLING.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.980
NO, LOOK, THE ONLY CRIME THAT
I SEE IS THAT A BUNCH OF YOU

10:47.014 --> 10:49.282
ARE WEARING PARKAS
IN A BASEMENT

10:49.316 --> 10:52.085
WHILE IT'S 110 DEGREES
UP IN MY COURTROOM!

10:52.119 --> 10:53.086
PARKAS?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.688
I GOT BOOB SWEAT.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.823
- WE DON'T WANNA CATCH COLDS.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.290
- ARE YOU TRYING TO CATCH A HAND
TO THE BACK OF THE FACE?

10:57.324 --> 11:01.762
HUH? Y'ALL DO REALIZE
SHE'S A JUDGE, RIGHT?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.296
- OH, HEY, WHAT'S UP,
YOUR HONOR?

11:03.330 --> 11:04.131
- OH, "WHAT'S UP"?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.799
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S UP,
BARRY WHITE.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.967
WHICH ONE OF YOU'S DANTE?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.902
I'M LOOKING FOR DANTE,
THE KNOB GUY.

11:08.936 --> 11:09.903
- I'M DANTE.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.371
YOU NEED A KNOB.
I ALREADY KNOW.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.405
RELAX.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.406
YOU'RE ALREADY ON THE LIST.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.142
OH, I'M ON THE LIST?
REALLY?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.309
THE--YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT
ON YOUR LIST?

11:16.343 --> 11:19.012
IS THAT FOUR-FIVE OFF SUIT
AND THE FLOP'S A JACK-QUEEN.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.213
I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.715
TEDWARD, SHOW 'EM HOW WE DO.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.717
- ALL RISE, DANTE.
ALL RISE!

11:23.751 --> 11:25.986
- GET YOUR VELVETY VOICE-ASS
UP TOO.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.354
ALL RISE.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.423
COURT IS NOW IN SESSION,
THE HONORABLE REBECCA WRIGHT,

11:30.457 --> 11:32.025
JUDGE PRESIDING.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.326
PLEASE BE SEATED
AND COME TO ORDER.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.462
[A/C whirs]

11:35.495 --> 11:38.065
- [chuckles]

11:38.098 --> 11:39.199
[applause]

11:39.232 --> 11:44.938
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE LOVELY AND TALENTED, DANTE.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.974
- WOO.
- THANK YOU.

11:47.007 --> 11:50.410
- NO LAST NAME, APPARENTLY.
[clears throat]

11:50.443 --> 11:52.245
COUNSELOR, YOUR CLIENT.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.514
- BEFORE YOU SENTENCE ME,
CAN I JUST SAY--

11:54.547 --> 11:57.317
UH, CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING?

11:57.350 --> 11:58.919
I'M A MOTHER,
YOU ARE A MOTHER--

11:58.952 --> 12:00.788
- NO, SHE'S NOT.
NOT A MOM.

12:00.821 --> 12:01.889
- THANK YOU, TOM.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.390
- WELCOME.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.391
- IT'S A WELL-KNOWN FACT.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.859
PEOPLE SAY IT ALL THE TIME.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.227
ESPECIALLY OPRAH.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.763
YOU KNOW, BACK IN WHEN SHE WAS
"OPRAH" OPRAH.

12:09.797 --> 12:13.000
BEING A MOTHER IS THE HARDEST
JOB ON EARTH.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.804
- WELL, I WOULD TELL ALL THOSE
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF OPRAH,

12:16.837 --> 12:18.806
AND ANYBODY ELSE,
THAT THEY SHOULD WATCH

12:18.839 --> 12:21.074
WORLD'S DEADLIEST CATCH 'CAUSE
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE HARDEST JOB.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.943
- SINCE YOU'RE NOT A MOM,
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY QUALIFIED

12:22.976 --> 12:24.144
TO SAY, ARE YOU?

12:24.177 --> 12:25.979
- WELL, I'M NOT AN ALASKAN
CRAB FISHERMAN,

12:26.013 --> 12:27.480
AND IT LOOKS VERY DANGEROUS

12:27.514 --> 12:29.149
AND VERY EXHAUSTING
FROM MY COUCH.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.351
- WELL THAT'S BECAUSE
THAT'S HOW THEY EDIT IT.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.953
AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO TO ME.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.455
THEY MAKE ME OUT OT BE THIS
CRAZY-ASS FACE-MASK MOM,

12:35.488 --> 12:37.424
BUT I AM A GOOD MOTHER, OKAY?

12:37.457 --> 12:39.059
- OBJECTION, IRRELEVANT.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.560
WE'RE NOT HERE TO DETERMINE
THE QUALITY

12:40.593 --> 12:42.329
OF FACE-MASK MOM'S MOTHERING.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.997
- STOP CALLING ME THAT!

12:44.031 --> 12:45.332
- SUSTAINED.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.867
TOM, THERE'S A PUDDLE FORMING
UNDER YOUR CHAIR.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.335
JUST BE AWARE.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.871
AND THE PROSECUTION IS CORRECT.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.339
WE ARE HERE BECAUSE
REGINA BULLOCK

12:52.372 --> 12:54.441
WILLFULLY CHASED AND TACKLED
A CHILD.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.043
HOWEVER, IT IS THE COURT'S
OPINION

12:56.076 --> 12:59.479
THAT SHE DID NOT INTEND GREAT
BODILY HARM OR DEATH.

12:59.512 --> 13:03.283
THEREFORE, THERE WILL BE
NO JAIL TIME SERVED.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.353
MRS. BULLOCK, WILL YOU PLEASE
STAND FOR SENTENCING?

13:06.386 --> 13:08.989
I'M SENSING A LOT
OF HOSTILITY HERE.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.959
- WH--WHAT?
COUNSELOR?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.593
- NO ONE'S GONNA QUESTION ME,
I WILL QUESTION MYSELF.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.895
BIBLE PLEASE?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.163
- MRS. BULLOCK,
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.366
- OKAY, WELL, IT'S HAPPENING.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.868
WHOLE TRUTH,
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,

13:20.901 --> 13:22.870
BIBLE, BIBLE, BIBLE--
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.404
OKAY, THAT LITTLE BOY
OVER THERE,

13:24.437 --> 13:25.505
THAT IS MY SON.

13:25.538 --> 13:29.542
SOMEONE GRABBED HIM
BY THE FACE-MASK AND SWUNG HIM.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.411
OKAY?
LIKE A BIG FAT PURSE.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.846
WHERE IS THE YOUTUBE OF THAT?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.114
I WILL ASK YOU.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.315
I'D--I'D TACKLE THAT KID
ALL OVER AGAIN.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.617
AND ONLY I'D DO IT
HIGHER AND HARDER.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.486
PROBABLY SOMEWHERE NEAR
THE KIDNEYS, YOU KNOW?

13:39.519 --> 13:40.921
REALLY GIVE IT TO HIM.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.023
- MRS. BULLOCK, PLEASE MEET ME
IN CHAMBERS.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.324
- OBJECTION!

13:44.357 --> 13:45.458
GIRL TALK.

13:45.492 --> 13:49.162
- YOU CANNOT SAY THAT YOU WOULD
WILLINGLY HARM A CHILD.

13:49.196 --> 13:52.332
IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
FOR ME TO GO EASY ON YOU.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.434
- THIS OFFICE IS A MESS.
YOU LIVE LIKE A GOAT.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.303
LOOK, I CAN PUT JAIL BACK
ON THE TABLE.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.271
DON'T CROSS YOUR ARMS AT ME.

13:58.305 --> 14:01.041
- FINE.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.310
- OKAY, NOW YOU LOOK LIKE
AN ANGRY CARTOON CHARACTER.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.345
SERIOUSLY, YOU SHOULD HAVE
STEAM AND SMOKE

14:05.378 --> 14:06.346
COMING OUT OF YOUR EARS.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.414
SIT DOWN.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.615
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

14:08.648 --> 14:13.286
I MEAN, WHY ARE YOU
SO TIGHTLY WOUND?

14:13.320 --> 14:16.423
YOUR HONOR, MY ENTIRE LIFE
IS DEVOTED TO MY CHILDREN.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.491
IT'S WHY I GET UP EVERY MORNING.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.094
AND THREE MONTHS AGO,
MY HUSBAND WALKED OUT ON US

14:21.128 --> 14:22.930
FOR THE GIRL AT THE GENIUS BAR.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.432
- FIXED YOUR IPAD,
BROKE YOUR HOME.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.201
I'M SORRY, PLEASE CONTINUE.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.503
- SO A BOMB HAS GONE OFF
IN THERE LIVES

14:30.537 --> 14:32.572
AND THERE IS LITERALLY NOT ONE
THING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

14:32.605 --> 14:37.077
SO, YES, MAYBE I TRY TO PROTECT
THEM FROM EVERYTHING ELSE.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.046
- I SEE.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.114
AND LOOK, I SAW THAT VIDEO,
THAT LITTLE DOUCHEBAG

14:41.148 --> 14:42.115
DID HAVE IT COMING.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.650
BUT STILL, HE'S A CHILD.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.152
- WELL, YOU JUST CALLED HIM
A DOUCHEBAG.

14:45.185 --> 14:49.990
- YES, BUT I'M NOT
ON TRIAL HERE.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.458
- YOU KNOW, TOMORROW
IS THE FIRST CHRISTMAS

14:51.491 --> 14:54.094
THAT I WON'T BE WITH MY KIDS.

14:54.127 --> 14:58.431
THEY'LL BE SPENDING IT WITH
THEIR DAD AND THE STUPID GENIUS.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.200
SHE'S NOT EVEN A GOOD ONE,
YOU KNOW?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.335
SHE HAD TO ASK THE SUPERVISOR
FOR HELP.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.670
- THAT'S TOUGH.

15:03.703 --> 15:04.871
BUT LOOK, LOOK.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.240
MAYBE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING FUN

15:07.274 --> 15:08.475
FOR YOURSELF.

15:08.508 --> 15:12.345
I MEAN, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU REALLY LET YOUR HAIR DOWN

15:12.379 --> 15:14.481
AND HAD FUN?

15:14.514 --> 15:16.083
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.318
OH, THREE DAYS AGO I RENEWED
MY SUBSCRIPTION

15:18.351 --> 15:20.287
TO COOKING LIGHT.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.688
I PAID FULL PRICE.

15:21.721 --> 15:26.626
- WOW, STILL RIDING THAT HIGH,
HUH?

15:26.659 --> 15:29.296
MRS. BULLOCK,
I MAY NEVER FULLY RELATE

15:29.329 --> 15:31.064
TO WHAT DROVE YOU
TO TACKLE THAT BOY.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.100
WHEN IT COMES TO A MOTHER'S
INSTINCT

15:33.133 --> 15:35.468
TO PROTECT HER CHILDREN,
I'M CERTAINLY NO GENIUS.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.104
- GENIUS?
REALLY?

15:37.137 --> 15:38.405
- POOR CHOICE OF WORDS.
ALL RIGHT?

15:38.438 --> 15:42.442
I HEREBY SENTENCE YOU
TO SIX MONTHS COUNSELING.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.445
THE FIRST CARD, YOU WILL FIND
DR. GARY BOYD.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.480
HE SPECIALIZES IN DIVORCE
AND FAMILY COUNSELING.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.983
THE NEXT CARD, THERE'S AN
ADDRESS WRITTEN ON THE BACK.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.584
YOU'RE TO REPORT THERE
TOMORROW MORNING.
