Your last act
of the evening,

00:17.060 --> 00:22.022
put your hands together
for buddy solitaire.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.939
All right, guys,
one more time for all
your comics tonight, huh?

00:26.983 --> 00:29.246
Enthusiastic crowd.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.987
I love it.
Excited to be here.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.336
It's midnight
on a Tuesday,

00:32.380 --> 00:35.122
so all of us
are big winners, huh?

00:35.165 --> 00:37.124
So I'm from Kansas,

00:37.167 --> 00:39.648
where we have a special name
for a 12-year-old girl

00:39.691 --> 00:42.085
who's faster
than her brothers--

00:42.129 --> 00:43.695
a virgin.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.786
Okay. okay.

00:47.830 --> 00:51.312
Not much of a thinking crowd
tonight, that's all right.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.792
-Oh, I'm sorry.

00:53.836 --> 00:56.099
Are you expecting
an important call?

00:56.143 --> 00:57.535
Why don't you just
get off the stage?

00:57.579 --> 00:59.102
Why don't you get back
to your phone call?

00:59.146 --> 01:00.364
Fuck you.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.149
Great.

01:02.192 --> 01:03.585
Right here, in front
of all these people?

01:03.628 --> 01:04.890
You want me to just
fuck you on this stage?

01:04.934 --> 01:06.544
That'll be fun
for nobody to watch.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.292
That's my time.

02:09.781 --> 02:12.436
Hey dude, listen to this joke
i got yesterday, okay?

02:12.480 --> 02:14.569
Really?
-now come on,
just one joke.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.310
-One.
-all right,
here we go.

02:16.353 --> 02:18.834
So, in history class
they asked us,

02:18.877 --> 02:21.315
"what's India's contribution
to the modern world?"

02:21.358 --> 02:23.839
I said, "tech support."

02:23.882 --> 02:25.884
-Okay, so, you're
in history class,

02:25.928 --> 02:28.278
you're a 25-year-old.
Why are you still
in history class?

02:28.322 --> 02:30.802
Dude, it's the joke, okay?
It's a 40-word joke.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.021
-I get it.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.457
The punch line's
gotta come faster.

02:33.501 --> 02:36.156
-It's two sentences!
-Get there faster.

02:36.199 --> 02:40.247
Okay, brown man listen.
Brown man grab his iPad.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.987
Hey, do you actually
do tech support?

02:42.031 --> 02:44.338
'Cause I have a virus
on my computer.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.557
Too much porn, and brown man
says "fuck you."

02:46.601 --> 02:49.038
-Oh, nice.
-Mm-hmm.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.519
I do like how you use
that Indian thing, though.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.956
Keep doing that.
Make it your own.

02:53.999 --> 02:56.524
My guru has spoken.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.322
We're doing yoga today.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.719
You know I don't
understand Chinese.

03:19.329 --> 03:20.896
Come on.

03:24.639 --> 03:27.076
You're not helping
either one of us.

03:29.905 --> 03:30.862
Miss liao--

03:53.755 --> 03:55.017
man, get off the stage.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.540
Thank you, I will,
when I'm done.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.586
You suck.
-I appreciate that.

03:58.629 --> 03:59.935
Just tell some jokes!

03:59.978 --> 04:01.980
Great, yes,
more please, please.

04:02.024 --> 04:04.505
Get off stage!
-I will, I got three minutes,

04:04.548 --> 04:07.899
so I guess we're gonna wait,
and I'll just do this.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.901
This how we're gonna
spend your time, guys?

04:26.353 --> 04:27.789
What are you doing?

04:27.832 --> 04:30.226
Celebrating after
another great show.

04:32.837 --> 04:35.492
Don't you think
you've had enough?

04:35.536 --> 04:37.277
No.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.806
I'm fine.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.592
Okay.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.998
Phew.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.411
-Good morning.
-Hi.

05:24.454 --> 05:27.109
Hey, thanks for stopping me
before I ruined

05:27.152 --> 05:29.764
the ol' moneymaker.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.983
Sure.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.641
Maybe you should spend
a little less time
with Hanna.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.730
What does that have
to do with anything?

05:39.774 --> 05:42.080
It's just
her whole energy.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.168
Maybe it's
rubbing off on you.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.257
We're talking energy now.

05:45.301 --> 05:48.173
Do you want me
to grab your tarot cards?

05:48.217 --> 05:49.914
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.527
Sorry.

05:53.570 --> 05:56.747
Just, I'm not sure I can take
another bad show.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.184
And I know my face can't.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.883
What do you mean?
You love comedy.

06:01.926 --> 06:04.146
Right,
it's in my blood.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.473
Hi, can I help you?

06:26.516 --> 06:27.952
Yes, irwin Schwartz
is up there.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.911
I'm gonna do a set with him.
We go way back.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.261
Uh-huh.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.350
I didn't hear anything
about this.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.700
So why don't you go
pay Julie at the door
for your ticket, yeah?

06:36.744 --> 06:38.136
Do you know
who I am?

06:38.180 --> 06:42.271
I do, Hanna,
but it's not 1983 anymore,

06:42.314 --> 06:43.794
so just go pay
for your ticket.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.274
You do not talk
to me like that.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.623
Who the fuck do you think
you are, you little prick?

06:46.667 --> 06:47.972
Okay, name calling.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.104
-Why don't you just go--
-do not touch me.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.932
Okay, calm down.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.803
-I am a legend.
-Okay, okay.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.936
-I am a fucking legend!
-We have a legend
who's crazy.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.459
Come on,
exit stage right, legend.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.330
Here we go.
Thank you for coming.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.897
Here we go.
There's the door.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.333
Here we go.
Ow, that's nice.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.597
Let's go, let's go.
Bye-bye now.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.555
Bye-bye.
whoo!

07:24.618 --> 07:26.663
Shit.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.541
Hey, honey.

07:34.584 --> 07:35.977
Hey, I'm glad you called.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.240
I wanted to apologize
for this morning.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.981
Oh, don't worry about it.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.026
I left my anxiety pills
at your place.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.725
Oh, you don't need
that stuff.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.683
I'm not gonna take them
forever, you know.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.381
I know! I know.

07:49.425 --> 07:52.036
I see 'em.
I'll be right over,
all right?

07:52.080 --> 07:54.212
Thank you.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.145
Where the hell are you?

08:14.189 --> 08:16.191
I'm coming.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.162
-Hey, ma.
-Hi.

08:31.206 --> 08:32.729
I hear your letterman set.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.775
[Faint TV audio
playing]

08:35.818 --> 08:38.909
-You had no fear.
-Ha!

08:42.652 --> 08:44.654
You would be killing it
if you went up today.

08:44.698 --> 08:48.266
They don't fucking
deserve me.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.051
Slow down with
these, all right?
They give you cancer.

08:50.094 --> 08:52.270
I'll eat cancer.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.926
Hey, I got this joke
I've been working on.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.711
It's this pun thing
that is going to kill--

08:57.754 --> 09:01.105
I was done with puns
when Reagan was president.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.020
-Hey, give it back.
-No.

09:03.064 --> 09:06.589
Aw, did I hurt
little buddy's feelings?

09:06.633 --> 09:09.853
Hanna darling
will always love you.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.292
Look, mom, I just could use
some help with my set.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.859
Well, I really think
you should give it up.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.645
Thank you.
Maybe I will.

09:18.688 --> 09:21.212
Then you'll have more time
to spend with your mother.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.867
-I have to go
pick up Vanessa.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.826
-Vanessa's a cunt!
-Oh, god damn it, mom.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.175
Why do you have to
talk like that?

09:27.218 --> 09:28.742
You want me
to kill myself?

09:28.785 --> 09:31.005
-No.
-i will shoot my
fucking brains out

09:31.048 --> 09:33.442
and you can
just run away with
your little Mexican bitch

09:33.485 --> 09:35.313
and live happily ever after.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.315
I just have to go.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.580
Fucking asshole.

09:42.973 --> 09:46.890
I had my knives and spoons
just like I wanted it
yesterday.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.588
Somebody moved them.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.067
We'll get them right back
to where they were, okay?

09:50.111 --> 09:51.765
You need to
do it right now.

09:51.808 --> 09:55.464
-Yeah, do it right now.
-Zoe. That's not nice.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.379
Why are you yelling at me
and not at miss liao?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.381
No, I need it the right way
for my chicken salad.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.688
-Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
-No, I need to go
to the kitchen.

10:01.731 --> 10:02.906
'Cause I need another
one of these.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.647
Oliver, I need you
to sit down.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.867
No, but see, how I have it
is it goes

10:06.910 --> 10:08.520
chicken salad, chicken salad,
chicken salad--

10:08.564 --> 10:10.305
wow, you must be
really hungry.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.002
You didn't bring me
my chicken salad either?

10:12.046 --> 10:13.613
No, I'm sorry, another
waiter has your section.

10:13.656 --> 10:17.921
-I was at my mom's.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.141
Hey, I'll be right back.
I have to go to
the bathroom.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.664
-Yeah.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.884
Can't be any worse
than my irvine audience.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.458
Hey you, you new
to maple hills?

10:33.502 --> 10:36.636
Uh, no, no.
I could be.

10:36.679 --> 10:39.203
I'm an insomniac,
hypochondriac,

10:39.247 --> 10:42.554
-huge megalomaniac.
Seriously.

10:42.598 --> 10:45.819
Oh. I'm Vanessa's
boyfriend, buddy.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.125
-Are you a
social worker?
-No.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.562
No, but thank you
for thinking I could be.

10:50.606 --> 10:53.043
I'm a comedian, guys.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.828
I'll be here all week.
Try the shrimp.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.481
We have shrimp here?

10:56.525 --> 10:58.614
I have no idea
what the menu is.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.399
You know it's not nice
to make fun of us.

11:01.443 --> 11:05.012
Yeah, look, I'm not
making fun of you guys.

11:05.055 --> 11:08.189
I get what it's like
being here, though.

11:08.232 --> 11:12.149
Social workers, shrinks.
Everybody thinks you're
crazy, right?

11:12.193 --> 11:14.238
It's like being
at home with your mom,

11:14.282 --> 11:16.023
except she probably
doesn't make you kiss her.

11:17.198 --> 11:19.635
Kidding.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.898
You got a very
mad cat at home?

11:24.422 --> 11:27.469
I'm sorry, does one of you
translate for her?

11:27.512 --> 11:30.080
All I got was
"is some"

11:30.124 --> 11:32.343
okay, too much!
All right, too far, too far.

11:32.387 --> 11:33.693
I want my chicken salad!

11:33.736 --> 11:35.303
Man, that is your fourth
chicken salad.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.131
Do you really
eat that much?

11:37.174 --> 11:39.524
Hey, I'm back.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.396
So am I.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.835
What was that?

11:45.879 --> 11:48.708
Don't worry about it, man,
he's just some jerk.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.147
Chicken salad...

11:54.583 --> 11:57.325
Vanessa's class is going
to be my new spark.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.631
Writing about these weirdos
is going to get me
into the jubilee.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.242
What about that joke
i gave you,

12:01.285 --> 12:02.896
the one about
my cousin patel?

12:02.939 --> 12:04.767
-That was some bad shit.
-Yeah, that was
some bad shit.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.551
-Hey.
-look, if I win
the jubilee,

12:06.595 --> 12:08.292
that's gonna turn
everything around.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.034
And Stephan Martin
is running it this year.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.949
That freak would love
a show about crazy people.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.386
I mean, I don't know, man.
Are you sure about this?

12:15.430 --> 12:18.128
Yeah, yeah!
I mean ,look, comedy is
half insane anyway, right?

12:18.172 --> 12:19.869
-Look at us two assholes.
-I'm not an asshole.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.828
You are
kind of an asshole.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.786
Look, it just
seems like a lot,
okay, for some new jokes?

12:23.830 --> 12:26.006
Look, I gotta try something
different, okay?

12:26.049 --> 12:28.660
I've been doing this
for 15 years.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.098
Somethin's gotta change.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.756
Sir!
sir, excuse me.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.062
Hi, yes.
Yes, you, sir. Yeah.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.585
Hi. is this the place
that Stephan Martin

12:40.629 --> 12:42.239
does his hippie-dippy
bullshit?

12:42.283 --> 12:46.026
By "hippie-dippy
bullshit," you mean
meditation?

12:46.069 --> 12:49.116
-Yeah, I think so.

12:49.159 --> 12:51.031
I'm buddy solitaire.
Can you tell Stephan

12:51.074 --> 12:54.991
that buddy's got
a brand new bag, okay?
Like James brown?

12:55.035 --> 12:57.080
Buddy got a brand
new bag, wha-aa!

12:58.908 --> 13:00.127
No, it's not a great
impression

13:00.170 --> 13:01.519
and you clearly
aren't a music fan.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.870
-I like chanting.
-Awesome.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.002
Tell Stephan
it's called "the crazy show"

13:06.046 --> 13:08.178
and that it totally kicks ass,
you got that?

13:08.222 --> 13:09.832
I'll make sure
to let him know.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.747
Okay.
don't forget, baldy.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.271
Psst.
amazing pajamas.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.798
It is nice.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.324
I love nature.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.456
No, you don't.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.112
That's true.
Actually, I think
it's kind of ridiculous.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.332
Hey...

13:32.899 --> 13:34.901
Whoa.
what's the occasion?

13:34.944 --> 13:37.294
-You're gorgeous.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.992
Actually I found
a flower over there.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.689
That's what I thought.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.212
Hey, you know how
maple hill is looking

13:42.256 --> 13:45.128
for that new afternoon
activities instructor?

13:45.172 --> 13:47.391
-I'm your guy.

13:47.435 --> 13:50.003
Yes. I'm gonna
teach 'em stand-up

13:50.046 --> 13:52.135
and sketch, improv.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.485
Look, I really liked
that group yesterday.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.139
Are we talking
about the same people?

13:56.183 --> 13:58.925
Yeah.
well, they're...
Charming.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.623
Look, I know it's just
afternoon workshops,

14:01.666 --> 14:03.538
but these people
have real problems.

14:03.581 --> 14:06.497
I mean, yeah, it's
a counseling center,
not a psych ward,

14:06.541 --> 14:08.804
but they need
a specialist.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.937
I'm as special
as they come.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.416
We already hired someone.
Mr. rickles is gonna do

14:12.460 --> 14:14.505
a deep movement workshop.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.856
Okay, look, anybody
named Mr. rickles deserves
to be fired, one,

14:16.899 --> 14:20.033
and two, what the hell
is a "deep movement"
workshop?

14:20.076 --> 14:22.339
-It's good for your joints.
-Baby, come on, please.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.907
I'm just asking you to
put in a good word, okay?

14:24.951 --> 14:26.691
You're the only one
on my side.

14:26.735 --> 14:29.694
I need this.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.831
I'll see
what I can do.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.226
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.576
Mm-hmm.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.144
Uh-oh.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.062
You know, I have taught
workshops before.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.020
Oh, really?

14:51.064 --> 14:52.369
Where?

14:52.413 --> 14:55.024
-Bakersfield.
-Bakersfield.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.723
Mm-hmm.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.638
You don't have
your certificate, do you?

15:00.682 --> 15:03.380
Paperwork?
come on, who needs that?

15:03.424 --> 15:05.861
Me.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.342
Look, I don't have
a ph.D. Like you.

15:08.385 --> 15:11.301
-Mm-hmm.
-but I can still be very
useful to this psych ward.

15:11.345 --> 15:14.130
This is not
a psych ward.

15:14.174 --> 15:16.567
This is
a counseling center.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.961
Sorry.
uh...

15:19.005 --> 15:21.964
I can be very useful
to your counseling center.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.620
But honestly, it's kinda
"tomatoes-tomahtoes,"
right?

15:29.276 --> 15:31.234
Just kidding.
You got the job.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.323
Thought you'd appreciate that,
being a comedian, hmm?

15:33.367 --> 15:35.282
Yeah, that's--

15:35.325 --> 15:36.892
I'll have to remember
that interview style.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.503
Well, the Vanessa group
doesn't need therapy

15:39.547 --> 15:42.985
as much as social skills,
but comedy,

15:43.029 --> 15:44.987
comedy will take
care of that, huh?

15:45.031 --> 15:46.641
-Comedy.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.034
-High five.
-Okay.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.687
-Yeah.
-fist bump.

15:49.731 --> 15:50.993
-All right.
-Ah-hh!

15:52.081 --> 15:54.823
Let's go meet
the group.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.260
-Yes!

15:59.349 --> 16:02.309
Guys, guys.
Listen up, listen up.

16:02.352 --> 16:04.615
-This is buddy.
-Hi.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.313
I hear you already met.

16:09.055 --> 16:12.101
Okay... well.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.929
I'll leave it
up to you, then, huh?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.844
Good luck.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.024
Well, I didn't expect
to be starting today,

16:22.068 --> 16:25.114
but... here we are.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.421
What are you
doing back here?

16:27.464 --> 16:30.206
Thank you,
it's great to see you too.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.861
Guys, I'm your new
afternoon activities
instructor.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.950
Seriously,
what are you doing here?

16:34.994 --> 16:39.041
Whoa. I'm just here
to teach you guys
comedy, okay?

16:39.085 --> 16:41.435
Somebody needs to teach you
some fuckin' manners.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.437
Okay, all right.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.830
Why don't we just
get to know each other
a little bit first?

16:45.874 --> 16:48.224
Let's get into a semi-circle
so bring your chairs in.

16:48.268 --> 16:51.836
Could you bring them closer?
Come in a little bit?

16:51.880 --> 16:54.056
There you go.
That's the effort
I'm looking for.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.145
If you could just
scoot in?

16:56.189 --> 16:58.365
Could you just
take your chair and...

17:03.892 --> 17:06.329
Okay.

17:09.463 --> 17:10.986
Why don't I begin?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.380
Uh, my name is buddy.
I'm a comedian,

17:13.423 --> 17:17.297
and I want to be famous,
but since I'm here,

17:17.339 --> 17:19.125
clearly I'm not.

17:19.167 --> 17:22.650
I drink a lot,
i get high even more often.

17:22.693 --> 17:26.045
Some days I sleep
for 18 straight hours.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.002
Uh... okay.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.396
Why don't you guys
tell me your names

17:29.439 --> 17:31.398
and what brand
of crazy you got?

17:31.441 --> 17:33.835
Um, excuse you?

17:33.878 --> 17:38.144
Sorry, what's your
mental illness?

17:38.187 --> 17:41.625
My, uh,
my name is buford.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.497
But everybody
calls me "bugg."

17:44.846 --> 17:49.938
I worked at vons
on sunset and Vermont,

17:49.981 --> 17:52.506
before I started
seeing the ghost.

17:54.116 --> 17:57.206
Oh, like Bruce Willis
in "the sixth sense"?

17:57.250 --> 18:00.079
Nice.
all right, who's next?

18:00.122 --> 18:02.733
Elliot gomes.
Phoenix battalion.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.387
Oh, yeah?
Where were you?

18:04.431 --> 18:07.216
-Afghanistan.
-i hear that is beautiful.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.697
"Beautiful"?
what are you,
a fuckin' moron?

18:09.740 --> 18:12.134
Most people
would say yes.

18:12.178 --> 18:15.137
Oliver!
nice to see you, buddy.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.399
How long do
we have to be here?

18:16.443 --> 18:18.184
Vanessa said
we'd be doing yoga.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.142
You're not the yoga teacher.
Where's my chicken salad?

18:20.186 --> 18:21.535
Can I ask you
something?

18:21.578 --> 18:23.363
Once you finish
a chicken salad,

18:23.406 --> 18:25.974
how long until they bring you
that next chicken salad?

18:26.017 --> 18:27.541
I never get
a chicken salad.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.630
And yet you keep asking.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.460
-Hello.
-hi, my name's Zoe.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.070
And why are you here?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.680
Because my parents
are pieces of shit.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.204
Respectful.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.423
That is what I like most
about the youth of today.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.470
Miss liao.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.036
Don't wanna talk
to you.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.823
Okay, "brady bunch."
Let's begin.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.478
Guys, I want you
to think of me as the
cool teacher, okay?

18:51.521 --> 18:54.307
We are just gonna
straight chillax.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.830
"Chillax"?

18:55.873 --> 18:59.181
Yeah, you know, relax,
get to know each other.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.183
Hang out,
tell our stories.

19:01.227 --> 19:04.143
That stuff is very
healing, guys.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.102
So, what makes you
so special?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.538
I hate when people
call me special.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.323
I don't want to
tell you shit, dude.

19:10.366 --> 19:13.456
Fine.
we'll just sit here
in silence.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.633
Show us some comedy.

19:16.677 --> 19:17.721
Excuse me?

19:17.765 --> 19:19.419
Miss liao
loves comedy.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.335
Really?

19:22.378 --> 19:25.294
Okay.
your wish is my command.

19:25.338 --> 19:29.516
All right, uh, well,
a joke comes in two parts.

19:29.559 --> 19:34.260
You got your setup,
and you got your punch line.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.784
"Knock knock."
"Who's there?"

19:36.827 --> 19:38.525
"justin."
"justin who?"

19:38.568 --> 19:40.353
That's your setup.

19:40.396 --> 19:43.921
But the punch line,
that's where you get
your laugh.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.141
"justin time for dinner."

19:49.623 --> 19:51.886
I've seen suicide bombers
that are funnier than you.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.323
-I thought you
were a comedian.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.977
-No, guys,

19:56.020 --> 19:58.719
that's an example
of joke structure.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.374
Look, okay, look.
I will give you a real joke
from my act.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.898
We'll use this.
Okay, all right.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.596
So I lost my virginity
to a French girl.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.598
Which is kind of like learning
to drive on a Porsche--

20:08.642 --> 20:10.861
-boring!
-how do you know
it's boring?

20:10.905 --> 20:12.254
I haven't finished
the joke yet.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.647
My mother's French, dude.

20:13.690 --> 20:14.996
Well, she might like
a joke about her.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.348
You haven't said anything
remotely funny!

20:19.392 --> 20:21.089
You guys gotta
let me finish.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.830
I haven't gotten
to the punch line.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.789
Really hard to
get a joke out--

20:25.833 --> 20:27.269
okay, you know what?
Forget it, forget it.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.358
Let's just watch
a video, okay?

20:29.402 --> 20:31.012
Let's watch
a video together.

20:31.055 --> 20:33.754
We'll watch videos.
Oh, look, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.973
Low effort for
everybody involved,

20:36.017 --> 20:37.758
including Jerry.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.632
What do you think
happened to the French girl?

20:42.676 --> 20:44.939
Don't think about
the French girl, bugg.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.897
Hey, Stephan, it's buddy.

20:46.941 --> 20:49.596
Did you get my message
from that hare krishna?

20:49.639 --> 20:51.685
Anyway, I had to sleep
with all of your assistants

20:51.728 --> 20:54.035
to get this direct number,
including Dave, who is
a great lay,

20:54.078 --> 20:56.124
so you know,
call me back, man.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.039
Thanks.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.171
Okay, guys,
hell of a first day.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.956
See you later.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.310
Hey, buddy.
Hey, hey, buddy.

21:08.354 --> 21:11.226
Hey... I wanna learn
about punch lines.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.314
Oh yeah?

21:12.358 --> 21:13.663
You sure you're
not an emissary

21:13.707 --> 21:15.491
sent from that horde
here to attack me?

21:15.535 --> 21:18.799
Oh, no, man.
This is all just
really new to them.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.670
What's with "Chinese
chuckles" in there?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.759
Kind of an intense woman
for a workshop.

21:22.803 --> 21:26.633
Yeah, miss liao is
Tyson's younger cousin.

21:26.676 --> 21:27.808
So?

21:27.851 --> 21:29.636
Well, he managed
to get her here

21:29.679 --> 21:31.290
instead of a room
at state.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.249
She was a mail-order bride
or something.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.557
Her husband up in Fresno
used to hit her.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.515
A lot.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.343
She burned his house down.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.345
Pulled a "left eye."

21:43.389 --> 21:46.870
Yeah, I never thought
about it like that.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.090
-Yeah.

21:49.133 --> 21:52.485
When I was younger,
my mom wouldn't allow any
cussin' in the house.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.835
I mean, you couldn't
watch anything.

21:54.878 --> 21:58.621
But me and my older brother
used to sneak "delirious"
down in the basement.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.754
My mom said "fuck"
all the time, so...

22:02.016 --> 22:05.062
"Delirious"
is great, though.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.847
How about you, man?
You got jokes?

22:06.890 --> 22:09.806
Yeah, yeah, man.
I got a book full of 'em.

22:11.286 --> 22:12.679
I'll tell you what.
Next time I'm here,

22:12.722 --> 22:14.855
you bring 'em, we'll go
over 'em together, okay?

22:14.898 --> 22:16.900
Yeah, yeah,
that'd be great.

22:16.944 --> 22:19.555
That'd be great, man.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.340
Hey, buddy?

22:21.383 --> 22:23.472
You get to miss liao,

22:23.516 --> 22:26.649
everybody else
falls in line.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.696
Thanks, man.

22:45.276 --> 22:47.017
Come on. Come on.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.541
Come on.
This is your idea.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.499
Yeah, I know.
I know.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.283
I thought I was
in better shape.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.634
No, I could've
told you otherwise.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.376
-All right, well.
-See, you should go
work out with me.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.683
-I work out.
I call it drinking and--

23:00.727 --> 23:03.382
not eating right.

23:10.693 --> 23:13.304
This is beautiful.
-Thank you.

23:13.348 --> 23:16.220
-I did this all myself.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.620
Why do you
put up with me?

23:24.664 --> 23:26.448
I accept your flaws
and you accept mine.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.711
Yeah, but you
don't have any.

23:28.755 --> 23:31.105
Except my terrible
taste in men.

23:31.148 --> 23:34.021
-Hey, that is me.
-It is you.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.240
-Oh.
-mm-hmm.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.463
What's that?

23:41.507 --> 23:43.726
I have something
to tell you.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.163
Okay.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.650
I'm pregnant.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.000
-That's a good joke.
-It's not a joke.

23:58.915 --> 24:01.440
Okay.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.485
All right, let's--

24:03.529 --> 24:04.965
this is great news,
sweetie.

24:05.008 --> 24:07.707
This is-- fuck.
This is great.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.839
I...

24:09.883 --> 24:11.972
Why aren't you happier?

24:12.015 --> 24:15.628
I mean, the two of us
are a mess.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.500
We can barely
take care of ourselves.
Another person?

24:18.544 --> 24:21.938
Honey, you're gonna be
an amazing mom.

24:21.982 --> 24:25.725
-I can try breastfeeding.

24:27.857 --> 24:30.643
Baby, I'm gonna get
into the jubilee, okay?

24:30.686 --> 24:33.950
And then everything
is gonna be different.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.474
Everything's gonna
turn around for us.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.564
I promise.

24:44.744 --> 24:47.311
Next time, warn me before
you and your little "churro"

24:47.355 --> 24:49.400
decide to spring this
kinda news on me.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.707
-This is supposed to
be a good thing, ma.

24:51.751 --> 24:54.014
Maybe if you people
believed in the use
of condoms.

24:54.057 --> 24:56.625
-Listen, darling, don't
let her tear us apart.

24:56.669 --> 24:59.149
-Please, stop it.

24:59.193 --> 25:00.760
You think you can
take my son away from me?

25:00.803 --> 25:02.370
All you do is insult him.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.111
Yeah, well, I can do that.
He's my goddamned son.

25:04.154 --> 25:05.416
Okay, guys, we don't want to
wake the Korean neighbors--

25:05.460 --> 25:07.331
we have a bond.
A bond of real family.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.769
A bond of comedy.
What the hell do you have,
fuck face?

25:09.812 --> 25:12.249
-Buddy, you need to talk to her.
-She said she's gonna stop.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.817
-I never said that.
-You need to check
your mother.

25:14.861 --> 25:18.299
-Check yourself
out the door!
-Thanks, mom.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.867
-Wait.
-bye!

25:36.404 --> 25:38.058
I'm sorry.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.450
You're not my mom.

25:39.494 --> 25:40.974
If it happens again,
.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.106
Speak english.
We're in America.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.543
Do not make fun of bugg.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.936
Don't tell me
what to do!
Jesus!

25:46.980 --> 25:49.373
Argh!

25:53.769 --> 25:57.077
Careful, you're gonna
snap her in half.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.861
American kids
have no respect.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.429
I know.
I was one of them.

26:02.473 --> 26:05.172
-No.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.656
How do you say "pain"
in your language?

26:12.048 --> 26:14.398
"Tong."

26:14.442 --> 26:17.924
Burning down houses,
scaring the living shit
out of people?

26:17.967 --> 26:20.448
That sounds like
a lotta "tong."

26:20.491 --> 26:23.538
Vanessa told me
you had a daughter.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.627
Mind your own business.

26:27.237 --> 26:29.500
I like kids.
They're great.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.590
All squishy,
they're cute.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.505
Their heads smell amazing.
I bet your daughter
would love it

26:34.549 --> 26:37.247
if you just tried
one of these donuts.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.075
I told you to
mind your own business!

26:39.119 --> 26:42.209
-I don't know what
that means.

26:42.252 --> 26:45.038
Means "asshole."

26:45.081 --> 26:47.388
Oh, so, I'm
a double asshole?

26:49.085 --> 26:50.739
Eh, these are fine.

26:52.349 --> 26:54.482
Hello, everyone!

26:54.525 --> 26:57.920
I come bearing gifts.
Get excited, people,

26:57.964 --> 27:00.749
because these bad boys
are fresh

27:00.793 --> 27:03.665
and they are warm.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.581
That'll disturb my digestion.
It'll give me the runs.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.715
Very, very watery poo.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.673
Thanks for talking
about your shits.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.544
Dr. yee doesn't like
outside food in here.

27:13.588 --> 27:15.677
It's just donuts, okay?

27:15.721 --> 27:17.374
Those are full
of sugar and carbs.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.202
That's what goes
into donuts.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.204
Mommy and daddy
won't let you have
the good stuff either?

27:21.248 --> 27:22.902
-Shut your mouth, retard!
Whoa, whoa!

27:22.945 --> 27:25.644
Guys, we don't need
another "dangerous minds."

27:25.687 --> 27:27.167
It's all good.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.914
So you do like donuts.

27:36.698 --> 27:40.528
See, everyone?
Miss liao likes donuts.

27:40.571 --> 27:44.010
Our teacher
is trying very hard.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.751
Yes, I am.

27:45.794 --> 27:48.754
-Thirsty.
-great.

27:48.797 --> 27:51.713
Water.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.803
You'd better get that water.
Miss liao does not ask twice.

27:59.852 --> 28:03.246
Okay, I will be back.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.337
Fuckin' people.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.266
Door's locked.

28:24.441 --> 28:27.880
Ah.
much appreciated.

28:27.923 --> 28:30.143
Hey, guys,
i know it's common.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.840
I locked myself
out of my room,

28:31.884 --> 28:35.844
so, uh, what do we do
in that situation?

28:40.631 --> 28:43.112
Toucheé.

28:43.156 --> 28:46.594
Your water, precious.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.249
Great, now I can
check "getting hazed
by the mentally ill"

28:49.292 --> 28:51.642
off my bucket list.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.167
Get excited, class.

28:54.210 --> 28:55.995
We're about to have
a huge lesson,

28:56.038 --> 28:59.259
'cause today we're learning
about the history...

29:00.390 --> 29:02.218
Of comedy.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.482
Any questions?

29:05.526 --> 29:08.355
You're worse
than my cousin tan.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.574
He was retarded.

29:18.452 --> 29:19.888
...masturbating
this morning,

29:19.932 --> 29:21.847
and on my way here,
it made me kinda late.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.806
So... that happened.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.590
Ah, knuckles.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.810
I didn't think you came
to fringe shows, buddy.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.246
You know, I make
an exception

29:30.290 --> 29:31.682
when I'm on the fringe
of being interested.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.815
-Oh! good one.
-Thank you.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.991
Look, I just want to talk
to Stephan, okay?

29:36.035 --> 29:38.037
I don't know if he's
getting my messages.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.299
Stephan's not here.

29:39.342 --> 29:41.040
He's literally
right behind you.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.304
-No, he's not.
-Jesus.

29:44.347 --> 29:45.653
Is he even listening
to this guy?

29:45.696 --> 29:48.308
-He's absorbing.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.353
-Maybe.
-look, I just want
to tell him

29:50.397 --> 29:51.964
I'm doing some
next

29:52.007 --> 29:53.661
I'm taking things
in a whole new direction.

29:53.704 --> 29:54.793
Oh, that's
a boy band, right?

29:54.836 --> 29:56.403
Pretty good one.
Just let me--

29:57.839 --> 29:59.058
calm down, okay?

29:59.101 --> 30:00.407
Stephan's gotten
all your messages.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.887
He just doesn't want
to talk to you.

30:01.930 --> 30:04.150
How do you know that,
knuckles, osmosis?

30:04.193 --> 30:06.892
-Way to work in
a callback.
-Oh, thanks.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.850
Hey, stick around and you can
watch a real pro on stage.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.765
-Me.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.248
Thank you for that
warm welcome.

30:15.291 --> 30:17.772
I appreciate it.

30:17.816 --> 30:22.211
All right, guys,
i want to talk to you
about a new job that I got.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.126
I'm teaching
stand-up comedy

30:24.170 --> 30:27.303
at a psychological
counseling center.

30:27.347 --> 30:30.437
That's right.
I'm trying to teach
the insane

30:30.480 --> 30:32.482
how to be funnier.

30:32.526 --> 30:35.790
That's like trying to teach
the blind how to drive.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.879
I mean,
what's the point?

30:37.923 --> 30:40.012
There is
an Asian woman there

30:40.055 --> 30:42.753
who is covered in cuts.

30:42.797 --> 30:44.625
I mean, she's kind
of attractive,

30:44.668 --> 30:46.018
provided your turn-ons
include

30:46.061 --> 30:48.194
a horrible personality
and knife skills.

30:49.978 --> 30:52.851
She is a mail-order bride,
though, which is kind of cool.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.070
First one I've ever met.

30:55.114 --> 30:57.377
She burned her husband's
house down.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.900
Imagine how pissed
you would be

30:58.944 --> 31:01.163
if you paid for a woman
to be shipped from China

31:01.207 --> 31:04.079
and then she burned
your motherfucking house down.

31:04.123 --> 31:06.429
She "left-eyed" this guy.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.475
There's an Afghanistan
war vet

31:08.518 --> 31:11.695
who is a real charmer,
let me tell you.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.523
He has some serious
anger problems,

31:13.567 --> 31:15.917
but he's single,
so ladies,

31:15.961 --> 31:20.052
if your bucket list
includes death by
murder-suicide,

31:20.095 --> 31:23.142
-i think I've got your guy.

31:23.185 --> 31:27.450
But the best person there is
a black schizophrenic guy

31:27.494 --> 31:29.670
who got fired from vons.

31:29.713 --> 31:32.412
You hear that?
Let's count all those
shitty things

31:32.455 --> 31:34.675
this guy's dealing with.
I mean, he's a black guy.

31:34.718 --> 31:37.547
Sorry, but he's already
got a few strikes against him
with that.

31:37.591 --> 31:41.464
He's schizophrenic,
and he got fired from vons!

31:41.508 --> 31:44.511
Who the fuck gets fired
from a grocery store?

31:44.554 --> 31:47.644
My cousin is 14,
and he's a manager there.

31:47.688 --> 31:50.821
The only thing worse
than that is an Indian
in a wheelchair

31:50.865 --> 31:53.128
sweeping up at a casino.

31:53.172 --> 31:56.827
He's sweeping!
They couldn't even
give him a job dealing?

31:56.871 --> 31:58.394
So guys, when you think
you got it bad,

31:58.438 --> 32:01.049
keep in mind--
you're doing all right.

32:01.093 --> 32:03.660
-Thanks, guys.
Good night.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.710
He got fired from vons.

32:09.753 --> 32:11.581
How the fuck
do you get fired--

32:11.625 --> 32:14.410
-it's this ugly cat meme.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.978
I don't know.
My niece sent it to me.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.372
I'm actually just getting
a ton of writing done.

32:19.415 --> 32:20.808
-That's great.
-Yeah.

32:20.851 --> 32:21.809
I told you you'd find
your inspiration.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.029
-You were right.
-Mm-hmm.

32:24.072 --> 32:27.989
So, how are you feeling?

32:28.033 --> 32:30.905
-Hungry.
-oh, little baby.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.125
I'm fine.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.996
-Have you checked
your messages?
-No.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.519
When I'm at work
Tyson said,

32:36.563 --> 32:38.521
"don't check your phone."

32:38.565 --> 32:40.001
-Don't be a dick.
-That's what he
sounded like.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.872
Don't be a dick.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.265
You should check
your messages.

32:43.309 --> 32:45.746
-He's called
your land line,

32:45.789 --> 32:47.617
he's even called me.

32:48.836 --> 32:52.013
-Stephan Martin.

32:52.057 --> 32:54.015
-Uh-huh.

33:00.239 --> 33:03.024
This'll only
take a second.

33:03.068 --> 33:06.636
Hey, that was
a very interesting
performance last night.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.596
Yeah, did you see it or
did you just absorb it?

33:09.639 --> 33:12.729
-Ha, ha.
-Will you please
be quiet?

33:12.773 --> 33:16.037
Will you please
adhere to your own
Dharma experience?

33:16.081 --> 33:18.735
Uh, everything okay
over there?

33:18.779 --> 33:22.391
Just some human soul
lost in samsara.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.393
So that was quite
a dark set.

33:24.437 --> 33:27.222
-Compelling.
-shh!

33:27.266 --> 33:29.529
-Oh, thanks, man.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.009
Hey, look...

33:31.052 --> 33:32.532
I got a ton more
where that came from,

33:32.575 --> 33:34.708
and I know you got
the jubilee coming up, so...

33:34.751 --> 33:39.104
Hey, were those real people
you were talking about?

33:39.147 --> 33:40.844
Uh, yeah.

33:40.888 --> 33:45.327
Wow. you're kind of
an evil bastard.

33:45.371 --> 33:48.200
Uh, I guess.
Thanks.

33:48.243 --> 33:50.898
You need to be quiet.

33:50.941 --> 33:53.118
What if I was on
the phone with Buddha?

33:53.161 --> 33:54.423
Buddha calls now.

33:54.467 --> 33:58.079
So do shut up,
you unenlightened fuck.

33:59.646 --> 34:02.605
All praise
Buddha shakyamuni.

34:02.649 --> 34:07.088
Anyway, let's see what
you can do on the jubilee
emerging stage.

34:07.132 --> 34:09.047
Night one.
You kill there,

34:09.090 --> 34:10.570
and I'll bring you back
for the competition.

34:10.612 --> 34:12.702
I want to kiss
your bald head.
Thank you!

34:12.746 --> 34:15.835
Ooh, I'm fucking the world!
I'm sorry about that.

34:15.879 --> 34:19.143
I... shouldn't have said that
to a social worker.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.494
Ah, I'm still fucking
the world, though! Oh!

34:21.536 --> 34:23.409
Oh-ho, yes!

34:23.452 --> 34:26.281
To quote the prophet
ice cube,

34:26.324 --> 34:28.804
"today is a good day!"

34:28.849 --> 34:30.981
Oh, you know what?

34:31.025 --> 34:32.940
I'm gonna teach you guys
a little comedy.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.116
A little quid pro quo.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.813
What did we do for you?

34:36.857 --> 34:39.860
-It is Latin.

34:39.902 --> 34:41.949
I think.
Guys, not a language class.

34:41.992 --> 34:43.429
Oh, let's get back
to our lesson.

34:43.472 --> 34:45.039
What did you guys take
from that Jerry video?

34:45.083 --> 34:47.259
His voice sounds
nasal and strange.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.130
Well, I liked it.

34:49.174 --> 34:52.132
I liked the punch lines.
It seems like he thought
a lot about 'em.

34:52.177 --> 34:53.786
Yeah.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.963
That's a good
observation, bugg.

34:56.005 --> 34:58.661
Here's one of his classics.

34:58.705 --> 35:03.318
"Men want from their underwear
the same thing they want
from their women--

35:03.362 --> 35:06.582
a little bit of support
and a little bit of freedom."

35:08.236 --> 35:10.325
I saw that.

35:10.369 --> 35:13.372
I saw that, miss liao.
You liked that one
didn't you?

35:13.415 --> 35:16.375
I didn't know the communists
were fans of freedom.

35:16.418 --> 35:19.769
I have pretty underwear.
Target.

35:19.813 --> 35:22.163
-Oh.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.644
Okay, well,
let's not show anybody,
all right?

35:24.687 --> 35:26.646
Anybody else want to
talk about their underwear?

35:26.689 --> 35:28.169
Oh, I'm so gonna
get fired.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.128
All right, let's start
the lesson.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.613
How do you not get
scared up there

35:37.657 --> 35:40.094
when everybody's
judging you?

35:40.138 --> 35:43.228
Believe me,
you're scared.

35:43.271 --> 35:46.579
Absolutely terrified.

35:46.622 --> 35:50.583
But, you know, you gotta
learn to use that fear.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.585
You know
how moms can, like,

35:52.628 --> 35:55.240
lift a car off
of their kids?

35:55.283 --> 35:57.198
Same thing when
you're on stage, man.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.548
When you're a comedian,
it's kill or be killed.

35:59.592 --> 36:02.943
How'd you get started
doing this?

36:02.986 --> 36:04.988
I just needed something
to make myself feel better

36:05.032 --> 36:06.294
after my parents
got divorced.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.427
Yeah, my folks
got divorced too.

36:08.470 --> 36:10.646
Yeah, pretty common.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.736
That's it, though.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.129
My folks divorce
messed me up.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.696
That's what drove me
into the military.

36:16.739 --> 36:18.872
Yeah, I couldn't get in.

36:18.915 --> 36:22.310
-Too manly.

36:22.354 --> 36:23.659
All right, let's get
back to the lesson--

36:23.703 --> 36:27.881
you know, we're kinda
experts on pain.

36:27.924 --> 36:29.448
That's all we face,
right?

36:31.276 --> 36:34.061
There's always
something more.

36:34.104 --> 36:35.715
Tell us.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.590
You guys want to
hear a story?

36:45.377 --> 36:51.165
One night, after
my mother passed out...

36:51.209 --> 36:54.647
I went into the bathroom
and took about 20 pills.

36:57.345 --> 37:00.957
Apparently that's
not enough...

37:01.001 --> 37:03.917
Because I woke up...

37:03.960 --> 37:07.312
In the long beach center
for mental health.

37:07.355 --> 37:10.228
I was there
for six months.

37:12.882 --> 37:16.538
That place
is terrible.

37:16.582 --> 37:19.889
Take the glass
out of the mirrors,

37:19.933 --> 37:24.242
so you don't
kill yourself.

37:24.285 --> 37:27.027
Food is terrible.

37:27.070 --> 37:30.117
Jesus, Oliver,
you would be so
disappointed

37:30.160 --> 37:32.075
in what they call
chicken salad there.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.866
All right...

37:39.909 --> 37:42.085
How about we learn
some comedy, huh?

37:45.741 --> 37:48.744
Hey.
hey, buddy.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.746
Hey, man.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.487
Hey, that was...

37:52.531 --> 37:55.360
That was really cool of you
to share that with us today.

37:55.403 --> 37:58.232
What's a little story
about being institutionalized
among friends?

37:58.276 --> 38:01.496
Goes a long way,
trust me.

38:01.540 --> 38:02.976
Thanks.

38:07.546 --> 38:09.069
Oh, uh--
oh, yes.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.549
We were gonna go over
your jokes today, right?

38:10.592 --> 38:13.639
-Sure.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.337
You don't, um...

38:16.381 --> 38:18.121
You don't
have your notebook
with you today.

38:18.165 --> 38:21.777
-The notebook that
you write in

38:21.821 --> 38:23.736
after every class?

38:23.779 --> 38:25.738
Yeah, I just must've
forgot it, okay?

38:25.781 --> 38:27.392
It's not about me.
Come on, hit me.

38:28.741 --> 38:29.872
All right.

38:29.916 --> 38:31.657
Um... okay.
Okay, all right.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.049
Hit me.
Find a good one.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.268
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You gonna like this one.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.835
This is the one?
All right.

38:35.878 --> 38:38.011
Okay.

38:38.054 --> 38:41.841
"One cool thing about
being schizophrenic is

38:41.884 --> 38:44.931
you never
have to be alone.

38:44.974 --> 38:47.629
There's always another
voice to talk to
in your head."

38:48.978 --> 38:52.330
Okay.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.375
That sucked.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.421
I-- I got--
i got a better one--

38:56.464 --> 38:57.683
it didn't suck.

38:57.726 --> 39:00.425
You're just not
in the moment right now.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.252
I got an idea,
come on.

39:03.471 --> 39:05.299
Follow me.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.389
Try your joke
with the ball.

39:09.477 --> 39:11.479
-Yeah, yeah.

39:11.523 --> 39:14.526
It keeps you
out of your head.
Trust me, it works.

39:14.569 --> 39:17.267
I used to play
in garry shandling's
pick-up games.

39:17.311 --> 39:19.400
You know a lot
of famous people?

39:19.444 --> 39:20.967
Hmm.
I've been to their houses.

39:21.010 --> 39:25.363
-Oh! nice!

39:30.933 --> 39:32.239
You're terrible
at basketball.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.894
-Soccer's more my thing.

39:34.937 --> 39:36.374
No.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.291
Just relax.
We got all day.

39:41.335 --> 39:42.815
We got all day, okay?

39:42.858 --> 39:46.427
Just you,
the ball, the hoop.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.125
One of the great things about
being schizophrenic is

39:49.169 --> 39:50.736
you never have to be alone.

39:50.779 --> 39:54.870
There's always another voice
to talk to in your head.

39:56.568 --> 40:00.354
Especially if one of
those voices is a girl.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.747
That's right.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.619
One of the voices
in my head

40:04.663 --> 40:07.143
is a girl.

40:07.187 --> 40:08.928
You know how many times
a day I hit on myself?

40:08.971 --> 40:11.670
-12.

40:11.713 --> 40:12.758
So much better.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.457
Hey, can I ask you
something?

40:16.501 --> 40:18.720
-Why are you working
so hard at this?

40:18.764 --> 40:22.332
I know touring comics
that don't put in
this much time.

40:22.376 --> 40:25.161
My mom wants
to come see me.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.250
I want...

40:27.294 --> 40:29.427
Trina to see me
tell jokes.

40:31.298 --> 40:34.649
We've been through
a lot.

40:34.693 --> 40:39.088
Just want her to be
proud of me again.

40:39.132 --> 40:41.134
Let's get you
on stage, kid.

41:05.550 --> 41:08.074
-Let's get
this put away.
-Okay.

41:10.903 --> 41:12.818
Thanks for
listening today.

41:12.861 --> 41:14.689
Hey,
no problem, man.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.693
How long you been
having episodes?

41:26.440 --> 41:29.661
About a year now.

41:29.704 --> 41:33.360
I was getting good grades
up at Cal poly

41:33.403 --> 41:37.495
when... I started
seeing ghosts.

41:37.538 --> 41:40.454
Really fucked me up.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.803
We don't have to talk
about this.

41:41.847 --> 41:45.024
No, I need to
talk about it.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.678
-Okay.
-when it happened,

41:46.721 --> 41:51.509
I'd...
shake so hard...

41:51.552 --> 41:56.731
That my friends would call me
"polaroid picture."

41:57.993 --> 41:59.995
Like in that
outkast song?

42:02.432 --> 42:04.522
'Cause I'd do this.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.441
Piss in my pants, too.

42:14.096 --> 42:16.621
Never told anybody that.

42:16.664 --> 42:18.710
That's fucked up.
I'm sorry, man.

42:18.753 --> 42:20.494
-I know, you just
met me, man.
-Stop.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.714
Dude, stop.

42:22.757 --> 42:25.804
It's totally cool.

42:25.847 --> 42:28.676
You're doing
better now, right?

42:28.720 --> 42:30.591
You got it
under control.

42:33.159 --> 42:36.597
Yeah... yeah,
things are good now.

42:39.513 --> 42:41.471
Let's get this
put away.

42:54.354 --> 42:57.226
You were supposed
to be here an hour ago!

42:57.270 --> 42:58.967
I'm on my way.

43:08.934 --> 43:11.676
Thank you.

43:11.719 --> 43:13.242
You think you might
want to smoke less?

43:13.286 --> 43:15.027
No, asshole.

43:15.070 --> 43:17.246
Your father used to
ask me that all the time.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.509
What, are you gonna
leave me over that, too?

43:19.553 --> 43:21.207
Please don't talk
like that.

43:21.250 --> 43:23.296
Well, if you were here more
often I wouldn't have to.

43:23.339 --> 43:26.212
Jesus, I'm here
three nights a week.

43:26.255 --> 43:27.953
How can you say that?

43:27.996 --> 43:30.564
Here, come sit with me.

43:34.916 --> 43:39.747
I'll make popcorn,
heavy with butter,
just the way you like it.

43:39.791 --> 43:42.097
What am I, ten?

43:42.141 --> 43:45.187
You think I'm not
good enough for you?

43:45.231 --> 43:48.277
Look, I brought you groceries.
I'll be back Monday.

43:48.321 --> 43:51.411
You think you're
better than Hanna?

43:51.454 --> 43:52.934
I was at the top.

43:52.978 --> 43:54.936
I sacrificed my entire
career for you!

43:54.980 --> 43:56.372
I could've aborted you!

43:56.416 --> 44:00.028
Don't talk to me
like that.

44:00.072 --> 44:01.726
And don't bother Vanessa
anymore either, okay?

44:01.769 --> 44:03.684
Or I'm not gonna
bring you shit.

44:11.518 --> 44:13.607
Oh.

44:20.527 --> 44:23.573
It's Sunday.
Aren't you supposed
to be with Hanna?

44:23.617 --> 44:25.140
Didn't feel like it.

44:25.184 --> 44:27.099
I'd rather be here
with you.

44:28.709 --> 44:31.146
Thank you.

44:31.190 --> 44:33.671
-Darryl's pizza
emporium.

44:33.714 --> 44:35.542
Your favorite.

44:35.585 --> 44:38.458
It is my favorite.

44:38.501 --> 44:40.547
Thank you.

44:44.464 --> 44:47.989
You know, I turns out
I'm not that hungry.

44:48.033 --> 44:49.643
Me neither.

44:51.253 --> 44:52.951
Is it kinky
to have sex with
a pregnant woman?

44:52.994 --> 44:55.040
I'm in a kinky
kind of mood.

45:25.635 --> 45:27.812
That's actually
pretty good.

45:34.775 --> 45:36.298
That your daughter?

45:36.342 --> 45:38.692
-Whoa, whoa!

46:02.890 --> 46:05.284
You know, you're actually
kind of pretty.

46:05.327 --> 46:07.460
Don't tell Vanessa.

46:07.503 --> 46:09.636
I'm not pretty at all.

46:10.637 --> 46:11.986
You are.

46:12.030 --> 46:14.946
You just hide it.

46:14.989 --> 46:18.732
Me, I'm undeniably ugly,
so I can't do that.

46:19.864 --> 46:22.170
Daughter's pretty, too.

46:22.214 --> 46:23.781
Thank you.

46:25.347 --> 46:27.785
Sure she misses you.

46:31.179 --> 46:33.529
You know...

46:33.573 --> 46:35.488
You and I have
something in common.

46:35.531 --> 46:37.751
What?

46:40.014 --> 46:41.624
"Tong."

46:46.194 --> 46:49.719
I don't hit my head,
because I don't want it
ruin my pretty face.

46:49.763 --> 46:52.679
So you think I'm pretty?

46:54.159 --> 46:56.726
Pretty ugly.

46:58.598 --> 47:00.034
So how's everything
going with the group?

47:00.078 --> 47:01.949
You know,
they've grown on me.

47:01.993 --> 47:04.604
Well, now you've got
a feel for the place,

47:04.647 --> 47:07.128
I want to tell you my plans
about your workshop.

47:08.608 --> 47:12.177
Stand-up comedy
is like public speaking.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.266
I want your students
to finish your class

47:14.309 --> 47:18.052
with a speech entitled,
"who am I?"

47:18.096 --> 47:20.489
-Sounds exciting.
-No, no, I'm serious.

47:20.533 --> 47:22.709
Comedy can build confidence,
don't you think?

47:22.752 --> 47:25.930
Yes, it just...
Sounds a little academic.

47:25.973 --> 47:28.497
Repeat after me--

47:28.541 --> 47:30.586
who am I?

47:33.198 --> 47:34.852
Who am I?

47:34.895 --> 47:37.419
Who am I?

47:37.463 --> 47:38.986
Who am I?

47:39.030 --> 47:41.075
Who am I?

47:41.119 --> 47:43.251
"Who am I?"

47:43.295 --> 47:45.558
It's not a request,
buddy.

47:48.039 --> 47:49.736
I do not get
this guy.

47:49.779 --> 47:52.652
"
-that's lame.

47:52.695 --> 47:54.088
Agreed.

47:54.132 --> 47:55.698
We already know
who we are.

47:55.742 --> 47:58.136
A bunch of
anxiety-ridden crazies.

47:58.179 --> 48:00.834
Hey, guys, come on.
Be nice to yourselves.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.227
You're not crazy.

48:02.270 --> 48:04.925
I mean, you are, Zoe.

48:04.969 --> 48:07.058
Oh, sorry.
Just a joke.

48:07.101 --> 48:08.407
Everything okay?

48:08.450 --> 48:10.888
Yeah. what are you
looking at?

48:10.931 --> 48:12.890
Your class sucks.

48:15.022 --> 48:16.937
Anyway--
look, guys,

48:16.981 --> 48:19.113
I get that this
assignment is lame.

48:19.157 --> 48:21.986
But come on, let's turn
a negative into a positive.

48:22.029 --> 48:25.511
I think I got
a way to give Tyson
exactly what he wants,

48:25.554 --> 48:27.643
but better.

48:27.687 --> 48:31.560
I'm gonna teach you guys
the biggest secret
of comedy.

48:31.604 --> 48:35.564
It's called "pp."

48:35.608 --> 48:36.696
Like pee

48:36.739 --> 48:39.873
yes!
Oliver with the joke!

48:39.917 --> 48:42.832
Did not realize
he made a joke, okay.

48:42.876 --> 48:45.183
Yes, like pp.

48:45.226 --> 48:49.056
Once you master the two ps,
you will know exactly
who the hell you are.

48:49.100 --> 48:51.319
Who the fuck do you
think you are, huh?

48:51.363 --> 48:53.626
You think you're
"captain, my captain"?

48:53.669 --> 48:55.410
You think you're
gonna save us?

48:55.454 --> 48:58.544
Get the hell
out of my face.

48:58.587 --> 49:00.154
-Zoe.

49:00.198 --> 49:02.896
Shut up.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.811
Whatever.

49:11.078 --> 49:12.862
I want to learn
about pp.

49:12.906 --> 49:14.560
Me, too.

49:16.040 --> 49:18.912
You guys have
such refined taste.

49:18.956 --> 49:22.350
Good comedy, guys?
Honest comedy?

49:22.394 --> 49:25.440
It's "painful"
and it's "personal."

49:25.484 --> 49:27.660
You gotta dig deep, guys.

49:27.703 --> 49:31.055
You gotta get to that stuff
that people can relate to.

49:31.098 --> 49:33.971
Anybody have a personal story
they want to share?

49:39.715 --> 49:41.630
You guys know
I'll wait.

49:43.284 --> 49:45.286
Hell, yeah.

49:48.637 --> 49:50.465
Well, before
i got discharged,

49:50.509 --> 49:52.250
I actually
got quarantined.

49:52.293 --> 49:53.860
The only thing
that got me through

49:53.903 --> 49:55.993
was there was this British
soldier named Winston.

49:56.036 --> 49:59.387
He was paralyzed and he was
dying from a shrapnel injury.

49:59.431 --> 50:01.911
I thought this
was supposed to be
a funny story.

50:01.955 --> 50:03.565
Zoe, quiet.

50:05.045 --> 50:07.743
Anyway, he never lost
his sense of humor.

50:07.787 --> 50:11.051
He'd wake up every
morning and he'd go,

50:11.095 --> 50:12.879
you know, Elliot?

50:12.922 --> 50:15.403
I look 'round here,
all these young men

50:15.447 --> 50:16.970
dyin' for their country,

50:17.014 --> 50:20.495
and you know what I find
really moving?

50:20.539 --> 50:21.801
Everything but my legs."

50:24.064 --> 50:25.761
That was awesome.

50:25.805 --> 50:27.328
Thank you.

50:27.372 --> 50:29.591
All right, who's next?

50:34.379 --> 50:38.905
When I was a kid,
i was afraid of everything--

50:38.948 --> 50:41.429
roller coasters,
the dentist,

50:41.473 --> 50:44.215
my reflection.

50:44.258 --> 50:47.044
I didn't brush my teeth
in front of the bathroom mirror
until I was 23.

50:48.349 --> 50:50.699
I mean, I was afraid
to masturbate

50:50.743 --> 50:52.310
until I took myself
on a date first.

50:54.007 --> 50:56.575
Nice!
went a little dark.

50:56.618 --> 50:58.185
Good work, bugg.

51:00.144 --> 51:02.146
All right, let's go
to the next lesson.

51:33.916 --> 51:36.876
Now get outta here.
I'll see you tomorrow.

51:36.919 --> 51:39.357
Bye, Zoe.
Bye, miss liao.

51:43.665 --> 51:45.798
What, can't get
enough of me?

51:50.150 --> 51:51.978
What are you
lookin' at?

51:54.023 --> 51:56.156
A computer screen.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.767
I'm im-ing my fianceée,
is that okay?

51:58.811 --> 52:00.465
Ah, yeah.

52:03.424 --> 52:05.687
Everything okay?

52:09.561 --> 52:12.912
"Flowergirl81."
is that her?

52:12.955 --> 52:15.175
Yeah.

52:15.219 --> 52:17.525
What kind of name
is "flowergirl81"?

52:17.569 --> 52:19.440
It's a good name.

52:21.877 --> 52:24.402
What are you doing
im

52:24.445 --> 52:27.709
women need
love and affection...

52:27.753 --> 52:30.190
I think.

52:30.234 --> 52:32.279
You're not
in Afghanistan anymore.

52:32.323 --> 52:34.107
No, I'm going to
an anxiety workshop

52:34.151 --> 52:35.848
in koreatown
five days a week.

52:35.891 --> 52:38.285
Yeah.

52:38.329 --> 52:40.635
And you're doing
really good.

52:40.679 --> 52:42.768
Hell of a cockney accent.

52:45.118 --> 52:47.076
When's the last time
you saw her?

52:48.730 --> 52:50.906
A while.

52:53.561 --> 52:56.085
Let me try something.

52:56.129 --> 52:58.087
What are you doing?
Are you serious?

52:58.131 --> 52:59.480
Trust me.

53:06.966 --> 53:08.707
What the hell is that?

53:08.750 --> 53:11.231
It's a joke.
Look, I know,

53:11.275 --> 53:13.538
it's not my best,
but it's serviceable.

53:21.372 --> 53:23.939
See?

53:23.983 --> 53:26.028
Serviceable.

53:29.597 --> 53:31.643
Feel free to leave
a message.

53:31.686 --> 53:35.342
I probably won't
listen to it.
Namaste.

53:35.386 --> 53:37.997
Stephan!
hey, it's buddy.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.826
Very excited about the jubilee,
thank you again.

53:40.869 --> 53:42.784
I tweaked my set a bit.

53:42.828 --> 53:45.047
Probably not doing that stuff
about the crazy people,

53:45.091 --> 53:48.703
so... yeah.
But I will see you soon.

53:55.710 --> 53:57.277
Buddy, I need you.

53:57.321 --> 53:59.105
Where are you?

53:59.148 --> 54:01.063
Come on, ma,
let's go home.
Let's go home.

54:01.107 --> 54:02.630
That's the last time.

54:02.674 --> 54:04.241
She's not allowed
back in here.

54:04.284 --> 54:05.807
Fuck off, you cunt.

54:05.851 --> 54:07.287
Do you know
who the hell I am?

54:07.331 --> 54:10.072
Yeah, I keep telling you--
a has-been bitch.

54:10.116 --> 54:12.205
-Fuck you!
-Okay, cut that
shit out.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.120
-We're leaving.
-Yeah, get her
outta here.

54:14.163 --> 54:15.774
-Fuck you, douchebag.
-Yeah, yeah, start
walking, buddy.

54:15.817 --> 54:17.558
Okay, we are, we are.

54:17.602 --> 54:19.821
Ma, turn around!

54:19.865 --> 54:22.215
Fuck him.
I'm Hanna bales.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.478
Does he know
I'm Hanna bales?

54:24.522 --> 54:26.698
I think he's aware
of it, mom.

54:28.134 --> 54:29.875
What the hell
were you thinking?

54:29.918 --> 54:31.920
Schwartz
can eat my shit.

54:31.964 --> 54:34.358
Four sold-out nights,
god damn it.

54:34.401 --> 54:37.535
I wrote for him.
He owes me.

54:39.232 --> 54:41.408
Let's get you
cleaned up.

54:58.382 --> 54:59.948
You feel better?

54:59.992 --> 55:01.950
We're never going back
to that shithole.

55:01.994 --> 55:04.039
Actually, I'm going
back tomorrow.

55:04.083 --> 55:06.477
I got into the jubilee.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.435
Thank you for
the great setup.

55:08.479 --> 55:10.959
How did you get
that gig?

55:11.003 --> 55:13.484
I don't know,
i wrote some new jokes.

55:13.527 --> 55:15.529
Are you trying
to leave me?

55:15.573 --> 55:17.357
Ma, I'm not leaving you.

55:17.401 --> 55:19.011
I think you're
leaving me alone,
you son of a bitch,

55:19.054 --> 55:21.274
-you dickhead.
-Stop it,
that's my book.

55:21.318 --> 55:22.536
Here's what I think
of your jokes.

55:22.580 --> 55:24.321
Ma, stop it!

55:24.364 --> 55:26.758
This is the queen.
You owe the queen.

55:29.587 --> 55:32.024
I was an idiot to think
you'd ever be proud of me.

55:32.067 --> 55:34.243
Oh, fuck you.

55:34.287 --> 55:36.507
Hmm.

55:54.176 --> 55:56.353
Yeah, knuckles can
take care of that.

55:57.745 --> 56:00.182
-Stephan.
-I'll call you back.

56:00.226 --> 56:02.359
Ignore my message.
I'm not changing the set.

56:02.402 --> 56:05.187
You change the set, buddy,
you're out of the jubilee.

56:05.231 --> 56:07.929
I'm sorry,
it was a dumb idea.

56:07.973 --> 56:09.975
We're good with
dark and compelling?

56:12.717 --> 56:15.110
Namaste.

56:15.154 --> 56:16.808
I think we might be
able to get there early,
get some good seats.

56:16.851 --> 56:18.331
All right, all right.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.289
Anybody have any jokes
they want to workshop?

56:20.333 --> 56:21.421
I don't have a lot
of time today.

56:21.465 --> 56:22.727
Whoa, what's
the rush, dude?

56:22.770 --> 56:24.729
Got someplace to be?

56:24.772 --> 56:28.036
-We heard you have a show.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.298
I don't know what
you're talking about.

56:29.342 --> 56:31.083
Ah, don't be shy, dude.

56:31.126 --> 56:32.998
We know about
the jubilee.

56:33.041 --> 56:35.392
The asshole
is famous now.

56:35.435 --> 56:36.958
Vanessa told us
all about it.

56:37.002 --> 56:38.090
That was nice of her.

56:38.133 --> 56:39.831
We want to come
see you, man.

56:39.874 --> 56:41.659
No, no, sorry.
I don't think so.

56:41.702 --> 56:42.964
You should be happy.

56:43.008 --> 56:45.097
I always wanted to be
a star in China.

56:45.140 --> 56:47.012
Great. why don't you
keep that Jackie chan dream
to yourself, okay?

56:47.055 --> 56:49.928
Oh, the funny guy afwaid to
perform for his fwiends?

56:49.971 --> 56:51.669
Come on, let us
come see you, man.

56:51.712 --> 56:53.540
Look, guys,
i told you no.

56:53.584 --> 56:55.760
-We're gonna see you.

56:55.803 --> 56:57.022
'Cause I don't
want you to come.

56:57.065 --> 56:58.458
'Cause it's
not appropriate.

56:58.502 --> 57:00.460
You're students.
You're not gonna come see--

57:00.504 --> 57:02.462
you know what, no.
It's a violation of
how we should interact

57:02.506 --> 57:05.117
as teachers--
you know what, guys?
You know what?

57:05.160 --> 57:06.945
Really short class
today, okay?

57:09.556 --> 57:11.645
What's with the stick
up his ass?

57:11.689 --> 57:14.953
It's just stage fright.
What do you think?

57:14.996 --> 57:17.042
We will go see him.
It's decided.

57:17.085 --> 57:19.218
Wait, I'm not decided.

57:20.567 --> 57:22.003
Okay, I'm decided.

57:22.047 --> 57:24.223
I've decided
you're not going.

57:24.266 --> 57:26.355
Let me go talk to him.

57:28.009 --> 57:30.708
Buddy? hey.

57:30.751 --> 57:32.666
Hey.

57:32.710 --> 57:37.149
-Yeah. I got a lot
on my mind.

57:37.192 --> 57:39.499
Well, listen.
Thanks for your help
yesterday.

57:39.543 --> 57:42.371
I really appreciate it.

57:42.415 --> 57:44.199
You're welcome.

57:44.243 --> 57:47.028
The assignment,
"who am I?"

57:47.072 --> 57:49.944
Tyson's homework.
You want to do that now.

57:49.988 --> 57:52.556
Hey, I got a 4.0
at csun, man.

57:52.599 --> 57:55.559
Highest-scoring officer
in Phoenix battalion.

57:55.602 --> 57:57.125
Not for dancing.

57:57.169 --> 57:58.649
No, I've come up
with a thesis, man.

57:58.692 --> 57:59.737
I just need
an example from you.

57:59.780 --> 58:02.348
-Yeah.

58:02.391 --> 58:05.525
I'm a comedian, man.
That's all.

58:16.275 --> 58:20.888
There is an Asian woman there
who is covered in cuts.

58:24.631 --> 58:27.025
Hey. just gotta take a quick
shower before the show--

58:27.068 --> 58:30.028
what the hell is this?

58:30.071 --> 58:32.421
-It's nothing.
-That's you talking
about my group.

58:32.465 --> 58:34.206
Baby, it's just
some jokes.

58:34.249 --> 58:36.861
Is this the stuff
you're gonna do at
the jubilee?

58:36.904 --> 58:39.211
You're exploiting them.

58:39.254 --> 58:41.648
You're exploiting them.
You said you liked them.

58:41.692 --> 58:43.128
Honey, I do like them.

58:43.171 --> 58:45.347
Look, this is just
some bullshit.

58:45.391 --> 58:47.654
You can't-- you can't
hurt them like this.

58:47.698 --> 58:49.917
They can't take it.
They trust you!

58:49.961 --> 58:51.658
They should trust me.

58:51.702 --> 58:53.965
I can belie--
i don't believe you.

58:54.008 --> 58:56.489
-I have to call Tyson.
-No, you don't.
No, you don't.

58:56.533 --> 58:57.882
Stop!

59:00.667 --> 59:02.843
Honey, no, no.
Let go.

59:02.887 --> 59:04.976
-What the fuck
do you care?
-Let go.

59:05.019 --> 59:06.934
Let go.

59:06.978 --> 59:08.545
They're not good for you.

59:08.588 --> 59:11.112
They're not good
for the baby, okay?

59:12.461 --> 59:15.726
Are you still
gonna do those jokes?

59:15.769 --> 59:17.945
I don't know.

59:32.003 --> 59:33.787
Buddy.
namaste.

59:33.831 --> 59:36.094
Hey.
what's the order?

59:36.137 --> 59:38.270
Don't you want to
check out the catering?

59:38.313 --> 59:41.055
We got gluten-free nutmeg
from Gandhi's tandoori.

59:41.099 --> 59:43.057
Isn't all nutmeg
gluten

59:43.101 --> 59:44.755
it's Gandhi's nutmeg.

59:44.798 --> 59:47.671
Hey, look, can you just
tell me when I go up?

59:47.714 --> 59:50.412
I got four bookers
out here for you, buddy.

59:50.456 --> 59:53.024
-Yeah.

59:53.067 --> 59:56.070
Yes. I'll be
in the green room.

59:56.114 --> 59:58.116
Go get 'em.

59:59.465 --> 01:00:02.947
Hey. don't suck
tonight, okay?

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:11.346
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.045
buddy solitaire!

01:00:21.487 --> 01:00:22.749
Too fanboy?

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:23.968
No, I can't wait
to see his face.

01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:26.144
You look great.

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:42.595
I recently took a job
at a psychological
counseling center.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.946
I teach stand-up
to the insane.

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:51.473
Everything okay?

01:00:51.517 --> 01:00:53.911
I left my medication
at home.

01:00:53.954 --> 01:00:55.739
When were you
supposed to take it?

01:00:55.782 --> 01:00:58.002
About an hour ago?

01:00:58.045 --> 01:01:01.179
I'll be fine, guys.
Gonna have a good time.

01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:04.051
There is a crazy
Asian woman

01:01:04.095 --> 01:01:06.750
who is covered in cuts.

01:01:06.793 --> 01:01:11.145
It looks like she
got into a fight with
100 knife-wielding midgets

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:12.930
and lost.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:17.456
But the absolute
best guy there

01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:21.721
is a schizophrenic
black guy who used
to work at vons.

01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:24.376
Do you understand
how hard that is?

01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:27.858
My 15-year-old cousin
is a general manager
at vons.

01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:31.165
I have seen a baby
run the register
at vons.

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:34.473
It is nearly impossible
to get fired from vons,

01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:38.564
but they had to,
because when this guy has
a schizophrenic break,

01:01:38.607 --> 01:01:41.306
he shakes and
then pisses himself.

01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:43.351
Oh!
-yeah. yeah.

01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:47.529
He is like a human
polaroid picture with
a very weak bladder.

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:03.937
-Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:13.599
-Get the fuck off me.

01:02:15.906 --> 01:02:17.081
It's not what
it looked like.

01:02:17.124 --> 01:02:18.473
Yeah, then what
the hell was it?

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:19.779
-Let me talk to bugg.
-Fuck off!

01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:21.259
-No, it's okay.

01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:23.609
-No, no, no, no.
-Don't make fun
of me no more.

01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:25.263
Don't make fun of me.

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:26.830
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

01:02:26.873 --> 01:02:28.657
-Leave him alone!
-Get the fuck off me.

01:02:33.227 --> 01:02:34.838
Hit me again.

01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:36.753
You're fucking crazier
than the rest of us.

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:38.189
What, "unknown soldier."

01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:40.931
You saving it for
your goddamn fianceée?

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.632
Got something else
to say

01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:48.068
say something else,
funny man.

01:03:11.004 --> 01:03:13.615
Yes, miss Jackson,
yes.

01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:16.357
I totally understand.
We'll wait for your
lawyer's call.

01:03:16.401 --> 01:03:19.099
Thank you.
Bye.

01:03:21.232 --> 01:03:23.321
How is he?

01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:25.410
Bugg's had a seizure.

01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:30.197
Did you know about this?
The show?

01:03:34.158 --> 01:03:35.681
Yeah.

01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:04.971
Hi, uh,
have you seen Vanessa?

01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:07.017
No, she hasn't
been here all day.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.108
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:11.151 --> 01:04:12.413
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:04:12.457 --> 01:04:13.893
Just here
to see Vanessa...

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:16.156
And bugg.
Are they around?

01:04:17.157 --> 01:04:19.246
You have no idea.

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:22.684
You think everything
revolves around you.

01:04:22.728 --> 01:04:24.643
Don't you?

01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:28.255
Get the hell
outta here.

01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:35.219
Is there anything
i need to prepare?

01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:42.443
Yeah, i-- yes,
i will be there on Monday.

01:04:42.487 --> 01:04:45.229
Yes, okay, thank you.

01:04:45.272 --> 01:04:49.624
Hey. I've been
looking all over for you.

01:04:49.668 --> 01:04:51.061
We should talk.

01:04:51.104 --> 01:04:53.324
I don't think there's
anything to talk about.

01:04:53.367 --> 01:04:55.543
Honey...

01:04:55.587 --> 01:04:58.503
I want to apologize.

01:04:58.546 --> 01:05:00.940
I'm gonna go stay on
my own for a few days.

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:06.337
Can you tell me what's
happening on Monday?

01:05:08.861 --> 01:05:12.038
I have an appointment.

01:05:12.082 --> 01:05:14.519
For what?

01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:16.042
Vanessa...?

01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:55.908
"Taco truck" isn't staying
with you tonight?

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:59.825
-No.
-i knew it
wouldn't last.

01:05:59.868 --> 01:06:02.697
Remember, everybody's gonna
turn away from your sorry ass,

01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:05.439
but Hanna darling
will always love you.

01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:08.790
You told me
that already.

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:25.938
Why do you hate me, mom?

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.593
Don't say that.
I love you.

01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:35.687
You gonna stay
with me tonight?

01:06:37.819 --> 01:06:39.908
-Yeah.
-hmm.

01:07:24.605 --> 01:07:26.781
Hi, mom, hi, dad.

01:07:26.825 --> 01:07:29.045
Stop filming, you little shit.

01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:31.438
Hanna, let him play
with the camera.

01:07:31.482 --> 01:07:34.746
Forget about
the little runt.

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:39.316
Hanna darling
will always love you.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:21.140
Yo, buddy.

01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.883
The fuck?

01:08:27.841 --> 01:08:30.018
Buddy!
dude!

01:08:32.846 --> 01:08:35.241
Just exercising, man.

01:08:35.285 --> 01:08:37.635
The fuck is the matter
with you, man?

01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:40.464
Look, I know
it's messed up

01:08:40.506 --> 01:08:43.466
that you got fired
from the counseling center,

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:45.904
but you got what
you wanted, didn't you?

01:08:47.384 --> 01:08:49.863
Stephan's
representing you.

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:51.256
Right.

01:08:52.997 --> 01:08:57.089
You want me to call
a doctor, or a shrink?

01:08:57.133 --> 01:09:00.353
Vanessa was gonna have
a baby with me.

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:05.402
"Was"?

01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:15.499
You need to get back
to what makes you happy.

01:09:15.542 --> 01:09:17.761
And what would that be?

01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:21.157
Honestly...

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.984
You were the happiest
when you were teaching
those students.

01:09:29.295 --> 01:09:32.080
Told you not to
come back here.

01:09:32.124 --> 01:09:33.821
I really want to
talk to bugg.

01:09:33.865 --> 01:09:38.216
"Being nice to buddy"
is not high on my agenda.

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:41.872
Look, I just want to
apologize to him, okay?

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:44.267
-That's all.
-Whatevers.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:46.834
Want me to stalk you
forever? I can.

01:09:46.877 --> 01:09:49.054
I can set up
an office in here.

01:09:49.096 --> 01:09:52.578
In this little munchkin
office right under here, huh?

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:56.104
When the phone's for me,
just let me know.

01:09:56.148 --> 01:09:58.977
Please, go.

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:12.295
I get it.
I'm persona non grata
around here.

01:10:22.435 --> 01:10:24.002
Not any better
at basketball, huh?

01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:31.052
You know, they had to
up my medication.

01:10:31.096 --> 01:10:32.837
I'm sorry.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.318
They doubled it.

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:38.277
I hate taking that stuff.

01:10:38.321 --> 01:10:40.279
Makes me throw up.

01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:42.673
I should go.

01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:47.939
"Polaroid picture"?

01:10:50.202 --> 01:10:52.160
I trusted you.

01:10:52.204 --> 01:10:54.641
-I trusted you!
-I know.

01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:57.731
You treated me just like
the rest of 'em, man.

01:11:00.952 --> 01:11:03.650
If you never want to
see me again, I get that.

01:11:04.738 --> 01:11:07.001
You're good, bugg.

01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:10.004
You're funny.

01:11:10.048 --> 01:11:13.312
Don't let the fact
that I'm a piece of shit
take that away from you.

01:11:29.633 --> 01:11:32.244
Buddy, I need you.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.941
Coming.

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:46.519
Oh, there you are.

01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:48.478
What the hell?

01:11:48.521 --> 01:11:51.132
-I thought
i told you to leave!
-Look, I have an idea.

01:11:51.176 --> 01:11:52.482
Just don't give me
the "wrath of Khan"

01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:54.962
for just one second
and listen to me.

01:11:55.006 --> 01:11:57.313
-These students
are good at comedy.

01:11:57.356 --> 01:11:59.315
You should do a show.
You do it here.

01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:01.360
You invite their family.
You invite their friends.

01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:03.754
Look, they get some laughs,
it'll feel great,
believe me.

01:12:03.797 --> 01:12:06.104
It's good for social skills
which is what you wanted--

01:12:06.147 --> 01:12:08.106
back off!

01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:09.890
I won't be around.

01:12:09.934 --> 01:12:11.892
-You don't have to
worry about me.

01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:18.290
I'll think
about it, okay?

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.553
Thank you.

01:12:31.782 --> 01:12:35.002
Stop fucking
calling me, mom.

01:12:37.091 --> 01:12:40.007
We all know him.
Doing two sets tonight,

01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:44.403
put your hands together
for buddy solitaire.

01:12:45.622 --> 01:12:47.972
Hey, buddy.

01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:56.328
I recently took a job
teaching stand-up comedy

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:58.722
at a psychological
counseling center.

01:13:01.594 --> 01:13:03.204
Hi.

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:10.473
God, I love comedians.

01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:12.431
I love "chuckle fuckers."

01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:14.085
Okay, whatever.

01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:21.745
Wait, I am gonna
give you a blow job.

01:13:21.788 --> 01:13:24.182
-I'm gonna let you.
-Okay.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:29.230
Let's see what
you got in here.

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:36.586
-Oh, yeah.
-Stop.

01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:38.544
You gotta have
somethin' better to do.

01:13:38.588 --> 01:13:40.807
-Come on.

01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:43.114
-No, I'm really
good at this.
-I'm sure you are.

01:13:43.157 --> 01:13:44.550
It will be better
for your self-esteem.
Go.

01:13:44.594 --> 01:13:46.422
Come on, up.
Go.

01:13:46.465 --> 01:13:50.164
-Fuck you, asshole.
-Okay, your dad's gonna
thank me for this.

01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:52.253
Don't you talk
about my daddy.

01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:06.572
-'Course it's fake.

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.881
Tyson, hi.

01:14:10.924 --> 01:14:13.536
You had a good idea
about the show.

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:15.538
Oh, thanks.

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:16.930
They're telling jokes
about their lives.

01:14:16.974 --> 01:14:18.715
It's quite inspiring.

01:14:21.152 --> 01:14:22.762
Hey, tell 'em
i said hello, okay?

01:14:22.806 --> 01:14:25.722
-Of course. Thank you.
-Bye.

01:14:50.398 --> 01:14:53.184
Let's hear
"polaroid picture"!

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.015
You know what?
No.

01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:19.993
Quite the exit, Houdini.

01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:21.908
What are you doing here?

01:15:21.952 --> 01:15:24.650
-Go home, mom.
-Come home with me.
I'll fix you dinner.

01:15:26.434 --> 01:15:29.263
-I can't be dad anymore.
-Who you gonna be, then,
Freud?

01:15:29.307 --> 01:15:30.874
I gotta pay you
by the hour?

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:32.876
You've been taking this
out on me for years.

01:15:32.919 --> 01:15:35.008
-It's fucked up, mom.
-You want to see
fucked up?

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:39.099
You're such a piece of shit,
you sweat feces.

01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:40.318
What's the matter
with you?

01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.407
No one ever
wanted you around.

01:15:42.450 --> 01:15:44.278
No one!

01:15:44.322 --> 01:15:46.672
You were worse than
a girl baby in China!

01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:48.631
Yeah.
yeah, let's do this.

01:15:48.674 --> 01:15:50.328
You're so ugly that
when you were born,

01:15:50.371 --> 01:15:52.591
your mama named you
"shit happens."

01:15:54.506 --> 01:15:56.943
-No!

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:07.867
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:09.652
I didn't mean it.

01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:12.306
-I love you.
-I know.

01:16:13.525 --> 01:16:17.137
Oh, please don't
leave me, please.

01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:18.965
Please.

01:16:31.674 --> 01:16:34.415
Sure you want to
do this, baby?

01:16:34.459 --> 01:16:36.766
Yes, ma'am.

01:16:36.809 --> 01:16:39.638
Whatever happens, you know
I'm proud of you, right?

01:16:59.527 --> 01:17:01.486
I can't wait.

01:17:01.529 --> 01:17:04.663
Hi there, hi there.
I am Tyson yee.

01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:06.839
You know me as
the head counselor here,

01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:08.841
and I will be
your host tonight.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:16.544
Oh, welcome to maple hill's
big show!

01:17:18.024 --> 01:17:20.461
No pressure.

01:17:20.505 --> 01:17:23.203
Up first, we have Zoe.

01:17:30.384 --> 01:17:34.432
Uh, I'm not very
good at jokes,
but here goes.

01:17:34.475 --> 01:17:38.784
When I was little,
i wanted to be a doctor.

01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:41.134
Now I need a doctor.

01:17:43.528 --> 01:17:45.138
Sometimes when i
tell people

01:17:45.182 --> 01:17:46.705
I did demolitions
in the military

01:17:46.749 --> 01:17:48.576
they're like,
"wow, was it fun?"

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.796
And I'm like,
"fun?

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.580
I defused bombs all day.

01:17:52.624 --> 01:17:54.887
The last thing I want to be
doing is having a blast."

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:59.762
I have extreme anxiety.

01:17:59.805 --> 01:18:02.939
So I'm a little nervous
in front of a crowd.

01:18:02.982 --> 01:18:05.593
But I'm even more
nervous in front of
these crooked lights.

01:18:06.594 --> 01:18:08.858
First joke, personal.

01:18:08.901 --> 01:18:12.035
My ex-husband beat me
and my daughter.

01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:15.734
Pain.
it hurts.

01:18:15.778 --> 01:18:18.781
Second joke, personal.

01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:20.957
I hate my ex-husband.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.003
Pain.
i burned down his house.

01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:38.757
Up next, we have our very own
buford "bugg" Jackson.

01:18:41.586 --> 01:18:43.240
You got this.

01:18:49.072 --> 01:18:50.769
I-- I'm bugg.

01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:54.425
-I'm sorry, sorry. Sorry.

01:18:54.468 --> 01:18:56.601
Hey.

01:18:56.644 --> 01:18:58.037
Don't apologize.

01:18:58.081 --> 01:19:00.692
Just get
your first joke off.

01:19:05.001 --> 01:19:07.743
It's okay.
I invited him.

01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:19.885
I used to be ashamed
of being different.

01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:22.932
But now I'm not.

01:19:22.975 --> 01:19:27.023
I have two voices
in my head.

01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:29.590
Any more and we'd be
a walking gang.

01:19:32.028 --> 01:19:35.118
One is the most
intimidating black dude

01:19:35.161 --> 01:19:36.815
that you'll ever meet
in your life,

01:19:36.859 --> 01:19:41.602
and the other is a 70-year-old
church white lady.

01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:47.217
So I'm pretty much covered
for any situation

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.001
that you can
possibly think of.

01:19:49.045 --> 01:19:51.874
If somebody cuts me off
in traffic,

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:55.616
the black dude
is like, "hey, hey, hey!
Forget you, man!

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:57.836
Ol' jive Turkey.
You see this bicycle."

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:02.841
And if I'm ever
grocery shopping,

01:20:02.885 --> 01:20:06.584
the white church lady pretty
much has me covered with,

01:20:06.627 --> 01:20:09.065
"excuse me, sir.

01:20:09.108 --> 01:20:11.545
I know you're blind, so you
probably didn't see the line,

01:20:11.589 --> 01:20:13.417
but it starts behind me.

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.245
Thank you.

01:20:15.288 --> 01:20:17.856
Gotta get this wine
to church communion."

01:20:29.912 --> 01:20:31.652
Thank you.

01:20:32.653 --> 01:20:33.829
You want to do
a set?

01:20:33.872 --> 01:20:35.874
Oh, no, no.
I'm good, thanks.

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:37.963
Come on.

01:20:53.065 --> 01:20:54.719
Who am I?

01:20:54.762 --> 01:20:56.286
What's he doing?

01:20:56.329 --> 01:20:58.201
Our assignment, dummy.

01:20:58.244 --> 01:21:00.856
I'm buddy solitaire.

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:03.554
I'm Hanna bales's son.

01:21:03.597 --> 01:21:06.339
My mother was my hero
growing up.

01:21:06.383 --> 01:21:10.778
I probably watched
her "letterman" set
thousands of times.

01:21:10.822 --> 01:21:12.258
Which is about
how many times this week

01:21:12.302 --> 01:21:14.391
she's called me
"a complete piece of shit."

01:21:17.698 --> 01:21:20.440
The physical abuse
was bad.

01:21:20.484 --> 01:21:24.749
She was either
hitting me too hard
or hugging me too close.

01:21:24.792 --> 01:21:28.405
We're kind of like
Norma and Norman bates
from "psycho"...

01:21:28.448 --> 01:21:32.888
Except we never had
a functioning shower.

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:34.977
She's my mom.

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.544
The only family I got.

01:21:37.588 --> 01:21:39.024
So whatever I feel
for her,

01:21:39.068 --> 01:21:42.593
I realize I gotta let
a lot of that shit go,

01:21:42.636 --> 01:21:44.987
because if I don't
I'm not gonna make any room
in the future

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:47.859
to meet--
to meet new people.

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:52.081
And that has been
awesome, guys.

01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:53.996
I truly mean this.
Thank you.

01:22:01.612 --> 01:22:03.788
Thank you so much.
It's so nice, so--

01:22:03.831 --> 01:22:05.616
excuse me, sorry.

01:22:08.271 --> 01:22:10.795
Vanessa, please.
Talk to me.

01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:16.061
That was great.

01:22:16.105 --> 01:22:17.976
You should be proud.

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.239
That means a lot.

01:22:21.197 --> 01:22:25.157
Buddy, we don't work.

01:22:25.201 --> 01:22:28.900
-We just don't.
-That's not true.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:31.163
We can't fix each other.

01:22:31.207 --> 01:22:34.514
I have to do it myself.

01:22:34.558 --> 01:22:36.560
Okay?

01:22:38.736 --> 01:22:40.738
Okay.

01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:58.886
I love you.

01:23:00.758 --> 01:23:02.890
I love you, too.

01:23:05.284 --> 01:23:07.156
Goodbye.

01:24:05.257 --> 01:24:06.867
Okay.

01:24:46.559 --> 01:24:49.910
