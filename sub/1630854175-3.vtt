WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:05.139
This is our target,
Tobias Kazan.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.508
He runs the largest fentanyl
syndicate in the Southland.

00:07.541 --> 00:10.344
And tomorrow he's throwing
a birthday party

00:10.378 --> 00:11.379
for his daughter, Aliz.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.913
I cut through
a mile of red tape

00:12.946 --> 00:15.249
to acquire
the Title III warrant

00:15.283 --> 00:17.585
for Kazan's restaurant,
which means what, Simone?

00:17.618 --> 00:20.588
That we break in
on the Q.T.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.690
and install surveillance equipment.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.058
But why, oh, why, Brendon,

00:24.092 --> 00:25.893
would a seasoned agent
such as myself

00:25.926 --> 00:27.328
waste his precious time

00:27.361 --> 00:29.330
listening in
on a kingpin's family shindig?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.332
Well, it looks to me like
Tobias' family tree

00:31.365 --> 00:33.667
and his crime tree share
a lot of same branches.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.036
And what better place
than a family gathering

00:36.070 --> 00:37.838
to run your mouth
and talk shop?

00:37.871 --> 00:40.007
And we'll capture
every word spoken

00:40.040 --> 00:42.610
thanks to the man
who literally wrote the book

00:42.643 --> 00:45.446
on electronic surveillance,
Agent Bob Telford.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.015
What a humbling day
this must be for you rookies

00:48.048 --> 00:51.519
to stand in the presence
of a genius like myself.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.786
Let's hope you can keep up.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.189
Oh, we will do
more than that.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.591
I'm the razzle.
B's the dazzle.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.960
If just one mic
or camera's detected,

00:59.993 --> 01:01.862
the whole operation is blown.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.365
So, I'd be happy if you just
didn't screw this up.

01:04.398 --> 01:07.901
You, "Vampire Fed,"
what's our first step?

01:07.935 --> 01:09.437
A surreptitious entry.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.975
Next, security.

01:15.008 --> 01:18.246
You'll have 15 seconds
to disarm the alarm,

01:18.279 --> 01:19.747
or this whole operation
is blown.

01:32.260 --> 01:36.964
Civilians call these bugs.
We call them mics.

01:36.997 --> 01:39.933
Now, you don't want the mics to
overlap and create interference,

01:39.967 --> 01:42.102
but, at the same time,
you don't want dead zones.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.071
Alright, in order to check off

01:44.104 --> 01:45.973
"participated
in a surveillance op"

01:46.006 --> 01:48.108
from your probationary
new-agent handbooks,

01:48.142 --> 01:50.344
you need to complete this
on your own.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.012
Start here in the dining room.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.914
Wake me when you're ready
for an inspection.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.516
Then we'll wire up the kitchen.

01:57.551 --> 02:01.822
And remember, everything,
even the dust,

02:01.855 --> 02:04.825
must be left exactly
as you found it.

02:19.072 --> 02:21.141
You good, B?

02:21.175 --> 02:22.376
Come on.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.812
Alrighty, Bob.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.147
We are ready
for your inspection.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.716
Prepare for excellence.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.950
We just rewrote
your handbook.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.819
Mm-hmm.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.222
Wake him up.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.088
Hey, Bob?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.499
He's dead.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.872
What the hell happened?

02:51.905 --> 02:53.073
I don't know.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.342
He was fine,
and then he wasn't.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.576
We got to call
the coroner.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.545
No.
The op comes first.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.380
Let's do a final sweep.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.881
We pack up.
I'll pull the van around back.

03:00.914 --> 03:01.982
You guys meet me there.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.317
But--
I know, I know.

03:03.351 --> 03:07.488
Trust me. Bob would have
wanted it this way.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.925
Simone, don't forget
to lock the door.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.694
Watch his head.
Watch his head.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.567
Rest in peace, amigo.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.942
Bob was a legend.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.944
His surveillance ops took down
some of the biggest criminals

03:30.978 --> 03:32.613
of the last two decades.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.947
I once heard a rumor

03:33.981 --> 03:35.949
that he went 32 hours
without urinating.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.286
Forty-seven.
Man was a machine.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.687
Sounds like he's trying
to murder his kidneys.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.955
Well, I spoke to Bob's wife,
and she told me

03:41.989 --> 03:44.558
he'd been struggling
with high blood pressure

03:44.592 --> 03:46.026
and diabetes for years.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.962
So, most likely
he had a stroke.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.564
You okay, boss?

03:52.466 --> 03:54.435
Bob was a good man.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.804
And do you know
how we honor him?

03:56.837 --> 03:59.273
By finishing this op.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.741
Tobias' party starts
in six hours,

04:00.774 --> 04:01.809
and we need to be ready.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.412
So, I suggest everyone
get some rest.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.252
I'm not much
of a day sleeper.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.322
Ah, that's a lie, Laura.
You love to sleep.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.990
How about
I get us some breakfast?

04:19.493 --> 04:20.628
Sure.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.934
♪ Baby, I'm good

04:26.967 --> 04:29.970
♪ Baby, what you want?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.238
Excuse me, sir.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.006
Sir?

04:33.040 --> 04:35.175
Ma'am? I-- My bad.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.444
It's cool. It happens.

04:36.477 --> 04:40.113
That was a nice, little song
you were humming there.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.149
Thanks.
I wrote it myself.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.785
Alright.
Looks <i>and</i> talent.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.853
I see you.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.355
I'm D.J.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.856
I'm smitten.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.993
Uh, I'm Simone.
Nice to meet you.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.662
You here to inject some youth
into Cutty's

04:54.695 --> 04:56.096
breakfast book club?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.832
Wait.
My daddy got a book club?

04:58.866 --> 05:00.601
For senior citizens.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.269
Ah! Okay.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.937
And my mom left her notes
back at home,

05:03.971 --> 05:04.872
so I brought them over.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.306
I'm Ruth's daughter.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.141
So, uh, what you about
to get into?

05:08.175 --> 05:11.311
You know, there's a jazz fest up
at Expo Park today.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.380
You want to come with?

05:12.413 --> 05:16.517
I would love that.
I got to work, though.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.685
Some other time?

05:17.718 --> 05:18.986
Put your number in.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.357
You don't mess around,
do you?

05:23.391 --> 05:24.792
Not when I see something
I want.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.802
Critics say that Alice Walker's
too hard on Black men.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.336
I mean, it's nonsense.

05:36.370 --> 05:40.307
She told an honest story
of one family, right?

05:40.340 --> 05:43.176
Cutty, what do you think?

05:43.210 --> 05:45.379
Uh, I think I read
the wrong book.

05:45.413 --> 05:48.682
Is "How Stella Got Her Groove
Back" for next month?

05:48.716 --> 05:50.918
I can't
believe you.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.355
Well, hello, gorgeous ladies
and Daddy.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.525
Look who finally decided
to come home

05:57.558 --> 05:59.660
after worrying me
to death all night.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.262
Daddy, I'm not a teenager
who broke curfew.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.065
I'm a grown woman who
stayed out fighting crime.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.234
Okay, no matter how old
you get,

06:07.267 --> 06:09.937
you're still my daughter,
and I still worry.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.439
I tell my Dina
the same thing.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.273
You mind your father,
Miss Simone.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.175
I will, Miss Ruth,

06:15.208 --> 06:19.112
and I just met your daughter outside.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.347
She single?

06:20.380 --> 06:21.582
Very.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.850
Good to know.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.518
Oh.

06:24.552 --> 06:27.955
Your daddy did not mention
that you were into the ladies.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.458
Because that's Simone's
business.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.392
That I am happy to share.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.295
For me, it's about the vibe,
not the gender.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.363
Okay?
Okay!

06:36.396 --> 06:38.065
You ladies, uh,
continue talking.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.769
I need to have a word
with my daughter real quick.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.571
You best slow that roll.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.974
Dina's single because
she's got drama for days.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.208
Wha--

06:48.241 --> 06:50.043
And from what I've heard,
you don't want

06:50.077 --> 06:51.612
no part of that.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.582
No. Mnh-mnh. No. No.

06:59.487 --> 07:02.422
To Bob.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.626
Just another reminder that
we could all go at any time.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.160
Okay, if that's
a not-so-subtle nod

07:07.194 --> 07:08.328
to my heart condition,
look--

07:08.361 --> 07:10.063
oatmeal, fruit, egg whites.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.131
I'm doing better.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.668
How about you?

07:14.702 --> 07:16.470
How about me... what?

07:18.205 --> 07:19.907
The department therapist
sent over

07:19.940 --> 07:22.009
your counseling
discharge paperwork.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.345
Question is,
should I sign it?

07:25.378 --> 07:27.815
Absolutely.
I finished the mandated therapy.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.517
I did everything
the Bureau asked of me

07:29.550 --> 07:32.520
to return to full active duty
with no leash.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.854
Matt, I did the work.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.355
Come on, Laura.

07:35.388 --> 07:38.025
Your fiancé cheated on you
with your best friend.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.794
Of course
what Sam and Katie did hurt me.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.030
And, naturally,
an emotional betrayal

07:43.063 --> 07:46.199
triggers a-- a psychological
and a physiological response,

07:46.233 --> 07:47.535
which is what I experienced.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.770
But it was a momentary blip
that I've since moved past.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.447
Yeah, you know, maybe just
another month of therapy.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.024
Surveillance is a game
of patience and preparation.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.027
Got your change of clothes,
your food, your water,

08:14.061 --> 08:16.797
your snacks, something to use
as your restroom.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.532
I'm not tinkling
in that thing.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.705
I was just a bit startled--
no big deal.

08:24.738 --> 08:28.141
Yeah, well, the new cellphone
you just bought says otherwise.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.410
Katie's phone call
clearly upset you.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.645
I haven't spoken to Katie
in six months, okay?

08:31.679 --> 08:32.680
And there she was.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.514
Who are we talking about?
Who's Katie?

08:34.548 --> 08:37.017
Nobody.
Mind your own business.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.987
You can explain it
and analyze it all you want.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.121
I saw what I saw.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.928
You're ordering food already?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.097
It's a dinner reservation
for tonight.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.100
Ooh, somebody's got
a hot date.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.904
With my wife.
Just needs to be special.

08:56.937 --> 08:57.938
Look at you.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.073
Pretending to be
a tough G-man

09:00.107 --> 09:03.043
who does his business
in a jar,

09:03.076 --> 09:05.545
when you really are a romantic

09:05.579 --> 09:10.684
and you just want to have
some sexy time with your wifey.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.555
Hey, sweet thing.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.758
You checking to see
if my schedule freed up?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.059
D.J.: <i>Well, has it?</i>

09:19.092 --> 09:20.728
Afraid not.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.697
Well, at least I got a chance
to see your pretty face again.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.298
<i>Can't wait to see more.</i>

09:25.332 --> 09:26.533
Ooh!

09:26.566 --> 09:27.635
Do I need to call HR?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.402
I'mma have to call you back.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.541
Okay. Did she seem like drama
to you?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.744
Maybe a little thirsty,
but drama?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.612
I don't know.
So, my dad was saying--

09:38.646 --> 09:40.080
I don't want to hear
none of this story.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.617
Thank God.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.452
Alright.

09:45.485 --> 09:46.987
Target has arrived.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.622
Alright, let's see how well
you studied the case file.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.724
Identify the main players.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.560
Okay. Uh, Tobias Kazan.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.095
That's his wife, Cora.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.164
They've been married 21 years,

09:57.197 --> 09:58.832
meaning she doesn't care
where the family bank

09:58.866 --> 09:59.933
is coming from.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.402
That's his daughter, Aliz,

10:02.435 --> 10:05.739
an SCLA student
with no real friends.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.975
'Cause if she had some,
they would tell her

10:08.008 --> 10:10.644
she has no rhythm
in those TikTok videos.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.981
They're sweeping for bugs.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.949
We got mics all over
this place.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.085
The FBI uses a higher-encrypted
radio frequency

10:18.118 --> 10:20.020
that's only available
to the U.S. government.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.089
Those store-bought detectors
won't find them.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.291
That is, if you
installed them correctly.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.271
<i>My dear friends,</i>

10:38.305 --> 10:41.208
<i>so happy to have you all here today.</i>

10:41.241 --> 10:44.477
<i>Together, we're celebrating
our beautiful Aliz.</i>

10:44.511 --> 10:48.181
As we say back home,
<i>chronía pollá!</i>

10:48.215 --> 10:49.850
<i>Chronía pollá!</i>

10:55.322 --> 10:56.389
Uh-oh.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.501
Who the hell
are those guys?

11:08.535 --> 11:09.970
The Dead Bastards.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.304
They're the most violent
biker gang on the West Coast.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.306
And there's their shot caller,
Rusty Filmore.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.342
Word on the street is he has
a major hate-on for Kazan,

11:15.375 --> 11:17.244
and it looks like he's here
to drop some bodies.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.688
Get ready to move in.

11:28.722 --> 11:29.823
This thing
can go sideways at any moment.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.432
Good-looking kid.
Baby-faced to be a gangster.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.168
That's Rusty's son Kellen.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.070
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

11:43.103 --> 11:45.205
<i>What, you're having a party,
and you didn't even invite us?</i>

11:45.238 --> 11:47.674
<i>It's my daughter's birthday.</i>

11:47.707 --> 11:49.542
Now, what the hell do you want
that couldn't wait?

11:49.576 --> 11:50.944
I want to talk business

11:50.978 --> 11:53.080
before it's too late
to save our deal.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.681
Holy hell.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.548
They're working together.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.418
Kitchen.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.456
Sir, we have a problem.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.626
Simone, we're about
to get proof that these

12:06.659 --> 12:08.128
two criminal organizations
are in bed together.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.230
I don't want to hear
about problems.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.398
What's the problem?

12:11.431 --> 12:14.134
Um...

12:14.167 --> 12:16.536
we don't have eyes or ears
in the kitchen.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.737
Why the hell not?

12:17.771 --> 12:19.973
Because we were just about
to wire that room,

12:20.007 --> 12:22.209
and then, you know,
Bob turned up dead.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.643
If we don't hear
what's happening in there,

12:23.676 --> 12:25.645
the whole op is a bust.

12:25.678 --> 12:26.646
Sir, send me in.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.983
Simone, if you get made
in there,

12:30.017 --> 12:31.819
you will not
make it back out.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.921
No one will think
I'm law enforcement.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.923
That's for sure.
Be nice.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.125
I can plant the mic.
Trust me.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.127
Matt, don't.
It's too risky.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.263
Okay, do it.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.966
But, Simone, the first sign
of trouble,

12:45.999 --> 12:47.400
I want you out of there.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.972
Get ready to watch your girl
save the day.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.180
<i>Hello, handsome.</i>

13:00.814 --> 13:02.482
<i>We're closed</i>

13:02.515 --> 13:03.650
for a private party.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.986
Really?

13:06.019 --> 13:10.023
That's weird because
I talked to Natalia yesterday,

13:10.057 --> 13:11.258
<i>and she said
that I should--</i>

13:11.291 --> 13:12.792
<i>She's not here.
Come back after 5:00.</i>

13:12.826 --> 13:15.128
<i>Oh, but I'm here now.</i>

13:15.162 --> 13:16.496
See, I just want to talk
about planning

13:16.529 --> 13:17.530
a little retirement party--

13:17.564 --> 13:19.632
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.335
Unh-unh, don't be.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.372
With them beautiful eyes, baby,
you never have to be sorry.

13:26.739 --> 13:30.043
I will, uh, come back
another time.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.312
But is it okay if I use
the bathroom real quick

13:32.345 --> 13:33.380
before I go?

13:33.413 --> 13:34.814
Pretty please?

13:36.549 --> 13:37.684
Just make it fast.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.020
Thanks.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.496
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

13:49.529 --> 13:50.530
I was gonna reach out
after the party.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.966
Hey!
It's a whole nother party

13:53.000 --> 13:54.501
going on in here.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.702
Who are you?

13:55.735 --> 13:58.671
I made a left when I should have
made a right.

13:58.705 --> 13:59.907
Look at this cuteness.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.208
<i>Okay, get out.</i>

14:01.241 --> 14:02.742
Okay, right, but before I go, listen.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.644
I want to have a party here.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.547
My daddy can't have dairy,
and the kids don't like meat.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.050
Everybody got something.
Can y'all handle all of that?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.151
No. Now leave.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.385
Okay, but the only thing--
Get out.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.853
Wait, you ain't got to put
your hands on me.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.422
<i>Wait. Don't touch me.</i>

14:15.455 --> 14:17.024
Ernestine!

14:17.057 --> 14:20.427
Ernestine, what the hell are you
doing in these people's kitchen?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.896
Luther, I was trying
to talk to them

14:22.930 --> 14:24.597
about your mama's party.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.867
And the next thing I know,
I'm being manhandled.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.602
Now, you being what, now?

14:29.636 --> 14:33.573
Sir, you and your wife,
you need to leave now.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.908
<i>Oh, we got to go, huh?</i>

14:34.942 --> 14:36.243
Come on, baby.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.912
Let's find a place
that values our business.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.081
Yeah.
We don't got to take this.

14:42.449 --> 14:46.286
<i>You promised we'd get
the package two days ago.</i>

14:46.319 --> 14:48.788
<i>Yeah, there's been a little
issue at the border,</i>

14:48.821 --> 14:51.091
<i>but now everything is fixed.</i>

14:51.124 --> 14:52.759
Yeah, well, I got people looking
at me like I can't deliver.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.728
I understand the position
I put you in, okay?

14:55.762 --> 14:57.430
<i>So, there'll be
a little extra</i>

14:57.464 --> 15:00.067
<i>in your package tomorrow night,
free of charge.</i>

15:00.100 --> 15:02.135
Boom! Just like that,
we got them.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.803
Now, tomorrow night,
we bust that drop,

15:03.836 --> 15:05.372
and we put Tobias
and the Dead Bastards

15:05.405 --> 15:06.940
out of commission
once and for all.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.808
Two birds,
one surveillance mic.

15:08.841 --> 15:09.876
I'll get with CIRG,

15:09.909 --> 15:11.378
get them up to speed
for tomorrow.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.946
Can we go home
and get some sleep now?

15:12.980 --> 15:14.581
No, you and Simone still

15:14.614 --> 15:16.149
have to remove all the wires and
cameras out of that restaurant

15:16.183 --> 15:17.284
after they close,

15:17.317 --> 15:19.086
and you'll need supervision, so...

15:20.353 --> 15:21.788
Right.
Unh-unh.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.890
Don't even think about it.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.593
Carter has a hot date
tonight, so...

15:26.626 --> 15:28.228
It's cool.
I can supervise.
Are you sure?

15:28.261 --> 15:29.796
Yeah, of course.
I'm not doing anything.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.298
Laura?

15:32.932 --> 15:33.967
Katie.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.304
Why don't we, uh...

15:37.337 --> 15:38.738
Uh, what the hell
are you doing here?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.440
I texted you.
I left messages.

15:40.473 --> 15:41.975
I didn't answer,
which would clearly indicate

15:42.009 --> 15:43.676
that I don't have anything
to say to you.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.346
Can we do this somewhere
less public, please?

15:46.379 --> 15:48.948
I really hope you didn't come
all this way to apologize.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.351
I came because I wanted you
to hear this from me

15:51.384 --> 15:53.420
before anyone else.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.388
Sam and I are engaged.

15:57.991 --> 15:58.858
Okay.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.727
No, it's not okay.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.297
You and I have been
lifelong friends.

16:04.331 --> 16:08.001
I just-- I-I hope
we can move past this.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.304
I already have.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.006
Great. I was worried
you were gonna be upset.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.974
I'm glad you understand.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.976
I'm sorry.
Understand what, exactly?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.978
We did nothing wrong,

16:19.012 --> 16:21.648
'cause you became
so consumed by work that--

16:21.681 --> 16:23.016
that you just couldn't
hold space

16:23.050 --> 16:24.051
for anything
outside of that.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.053
So, Sam and I bonded

16:26.086 --> 16:28.888
over being shut out
emotionally by you.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.358
Got it.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.227
Well, um, guess what?

16:34.261 --> 16:37.030
I-I've moved on,
and the two of you

16:37.064 --> 16:42.635
both obviously...
moved on

16:42.669 --> 16:44.571
with my engagement ring.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.876
Sam gave that to me.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.211
But you returned it.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.545
Okay, Katie.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.982
Uh, I-I-I really have to
get back to work, but, um,

16:56.015 --> 16:57.650
congratulations.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.353
I hope you're both very happy.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.889
And, uh, be sure to return
your visitor badge

17:02.922 --> 17:03.990
at the front desk.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.525
Uh...

17:11.898 --> 17:13.600
<i>Hey, Daddy.</i>

17:13.633 --> 17:16.936
Simone, can't you just call me
old-school like normal people?

17:16.969 --> 17:19.506
Uh, no. And why are you
all dressed up?

17:19.539 --> 17:22.175
You know better than to get
into grown folks' business.

17:22.209 --> 17:26.379
<i>I haven't seen you bust out
the cravat since Widow Jenkins.</i>

17:26.413 --> 17:27.847
<i>This must be juicy.</i>

17:27.880 --> 17:29.949
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.952
Daddy, wait. I called you
because I wanted to tell you

17:32.985 --> 17:34.954
I'm working late
and not to wait up.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.389
I won't.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.558
<i>See, now I know you up
to something.</i>

17:42.295 --> 17:44.063
So, I looked at the
reviews for this place,

17:44.097 --> 17:49.536
and everyone raves about
the bone-marrow crostino.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.670
My favorite.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.909
What's going on
with that promotion

17:56.943 --> 17:58.645
to the New Orleans
field office?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.214
I kind of spoke too soon.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.984
It's off the table.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.153
Don't be mad.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.421
I'm not.
And that's the problem.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.226
Lately,
the only feeling I have

18:13.260 --> 18:20.133
when it comes
to you and me is...

18:20.167 --> 18:21.634
indifference.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.270
We're not us anymore,
are we?

18:23.303 --> 18:26.339
Not for a long time.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.479
So, do we keep
the reservation?

18:35.448 --> 18:38.351
I'll drive you home.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.456
This girl is so hot, B.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.759
So, what's wrong?
You got your problem face on.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.695
My daddy thinks
she's trouble.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.129
How much trouble
could she really be?

18:50.163 --> 18:51.964
If you have to ask,
it's already too much.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.333
Trust me on this.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.435
What's got you twisted?
Nothing.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.003
Remember, her BFF was--

18:57.036 --> 18:58.338
Okay, gossip girls,

18:58.371 --> 19:00.006
no more talking
until you finish the job.

19:01.541 --> 19:05.545
Done. Now can we get back
to talking about you?

19:12.652 --> 19:14.020
Grab the bags.
Take cover.

19:29.436 --> 19:32.239
Hi.
So, why are we here?

19:32.272 --> 19:34.474
Don't be such a punk.
It's my birthday.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.875
I want a drink.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.417
Okay.

19:44.451 --> 19:45.885
I can buy you a drink
somewhere else.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.488
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
No. I want this.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.223
It's tequila from Greece.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.724
You're gonna love it.

19:55.127 --> 19:59.932
Tobias' daughter
and Rusty's son are smashing?

19:59.966 --> 20:02.669
Damn, this just got spicy.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.940
What the hell?!

20:10.777 --> 20:12.279
Oh, no.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.886
This is FBI Special Agent
Laura Stensen.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.521
I just witnessed
a kidnapping.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.857
Blue panel van,
license plate K-I-9-8-0-9.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.732
LAPD has a BOLO out
on the kidnappers' van,

20:32.765 --> 20:33.800
but we got to assume
at this point

20:33.833 --> 20:35.034
that they got away.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.436
So, we're gonna focus
on the bigger picture.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.804
Why the hell were Rusty
and Tobias' kids together?

20:37.837 --> 20:40.873
We're looking at
a Romeo/Juliet situation.

20:40.907 --> 20:41.808
No, these families work together.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.042
They're not at war.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.477
So I'm not sure that metaphor
really tracks.

20:44.511 --> 20:47.146
Okay, but it's more of an
analogy than a metaphor, so I--

20:47.179 --> 20:48.648
Alright.
Either way, the big problem

20:48.681 --> 20:50.483
is both their fathers
have a lot of enemies.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.752
So, we don't know which kid
the kidnappers were after.

20:52.785 --> 20:53.753
Maybe they were both the target.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.154
I mean,
that's a lot of leverage.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.557
Whatever the case, we do have
to notify the families.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.958
Whiplash.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.660
I mean, our-- our criminal
targets are now our victims.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.128
Are we gonna have to blow up
our surveillance op for this?

21:02.161 --> 21:04.397
No, at least try not to.
We'll tell them

21:04.431 --> 21:07.634
an eyewitness saw the abduction,
which technically is not a lie.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.602
We can use it as an opportunity
to gather more intel.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.003
These people
may be criminals,

21:11.037 --> 21:12.839
but we still
have to treat them with heart.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.273
I mean, their babies
are in danger.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.842
Yes, of course.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.144
But let's not forget, these
are ruthless dope pushers.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.412
Psychologically speaking,

21:19.446 --> 21:21.013
this will
trigger extreme duress.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.082
It's a high probability

21:23.115 --> 21:24.584
that they'll make
a careless mistake.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.152
Let's bring them in and see
what shakes out.

21:26.185 --> 21:26.853
We could get lucky.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.421
Absolutely.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.357
But saving these kids
is our top priority.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.859
Now, I have history with Kazan,
so I'll bring him in myself.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.361
Laura, Brendon, you get Rusty.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.363
Carter, Simone, your covers
were blown at the restaurant,

21:36.396 --> 21:37.697
so you've got to stay
out of sight.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.666
But start digging
into these kids' lives.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.334
Go through their phone records,

21:41.368 --> 21:43.536
their receipts,
their social media, everything.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.972
If we can figure out
how the kidnappers tracked them,

21:46.005 --> 21:50.477
we might be able to uncover
who the kidnappers are, okay?

21:50.510 --> 21:52.812
Aliz's entire life
is online.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.615
She likes
overpriced handbags,

21:55.648 --> 21:59.852
mirror butt selfies,
Jell-O shots.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.320
She's pretty basic.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.356
I mean, a spoiled princess

22:03.390 --> 22:07.126
who likes taking
sloppy photos at d-arties.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.461
D-arties?

22:08.495 --> 22:11.063
Gen-Z lingo
for day parties.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.833
Yeah, she just finished
her freshman year,

22:13.866 --> 22:16.703
and every other photo since
she pledged her sorority

22:16.736 --> 22:19.872
is her sitting on
some drunk frat boy's lap.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.408
She's a little ratchet.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.511
Okay, well, Kellen only recently
joined the Dead Bastards.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.878
And unlike his father,

22:25.912 --> 22:28.314
he's got
no priors, not even juvie.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.684
Well, since he was nonexistent
in her social feeds,

22:31.718 --> 22:34.020
I called his high school
guidance counselor.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.256
Of course you did.
Any intel?

22:37.289 --> 22:39.892
Well, she said
he was a "C" student,

22:39.926 --> 22:41.561
never been
to the principal's office,

22:41.594 --> 22:44.597
a quiet kid, self-taught
Harley mechanic.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.399
So that's methodical.

22:46.433 --> 22:50.770
She's wild. He's mild.

22:50.803 --> 22:54.240
Well,
opposites do attract.

22:54.273 --> 22:57.844
Yeah, but how did
these two even meet?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.278
I mean, their fathers'
businesses

22:59.311 --> 23:01.213
can't be the only thing
they have in common.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.016
Ah, wait a minute.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.885
It doesn't make sense.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.087
How the hell did you find out
about this before we did?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.055
An eyewitness
saw it happen

23:09.088 --> 23:11.591
around 3:00 a.m.
and called 911.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.561
And they called the feds
before the family?

23:14.594 --> 23:16.028
I don't think so.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.230
If I find out
you're lying

23:18.264 --> 23:20.266
and you're using my boy
as leverage--

23:20.299 --> 23:22.201
That's
a little paranoid, isn't it?

23:22.234 --> 23:23.770
I wouldn't put
anything past you.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.072
How about we focus
on getting your kid back?

23:26.105 --> 23:27.974
Have there been any threats
against Kellen?

23:28.007 --> 23:29.308
No!

23:29.341 --> 23:31.243
Of course not.
Aliz is a good kid.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.712
Were there any threats made
against anyone else

23:32.745 --> 23:33.312
in your family?

23:33.345 --> 23:35.448
No, just from the FBI.

23:35.482 --> 23:38.284
Did you approve of Kellen's
relationship with Aliz?

23:38.317 --> 23:40.653
Kazan's daughter?
He's never even met her.

23:40.687 --> 23:41.921
You're lying.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.990
Aliz would never go out
with that gearhead.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.992
They were spotted together right
in front of your restaurant

23:46.025 --> 23:47.460
just before the abduction.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.562
Why would your son

23:49.596 --> 23:50.963
meet Aliz there?

23:50.997 --> 23:52.398
She must have lured him there.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.833
He must have stalked her there.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.334
You saying the Dead Bastards
are responsible?

23:55.367 --> 23:56.102
Yeah!

23:56.135 --> 23:57.604
His trashed son seduced

23:57.637 --> 24:00.272
my little girl to get an in
into my husband's--

24:01.440 --> 24:03.476
Look, do I think Tobias
could be responsible?

24:03.510 --> 24:04.677
No comment.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.679
Now, if we're finished here,
I got work to do.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.014
I got to go find my kid.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.684
Kazan!
Where's my son?

24:11.718 --> 24:12.919
Where's my daughter?

24:12.952 --> 24:15.121
Hey, hey!
Back off!

24:15.154 --> 24:16.789
Come on!
Now!

24:16.823 --> 24:19.158
This isn't over!
Not by a long shot.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.192
Get him out of here, now.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.031
I'm sending agents
to your house

24:25.064 --> 24:27.033
to put trap-and-trace devices
on all your phones, okay?

24:27.066 --> 24:28.167
So, when
the kidnapers call--

24:28.200 --> 24:29.536
Forget it.
We don't want your help.

24:29.569 --> 24:30.803
Don't do this.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.138
Taking matters
into your own hands

24:32.171 --> 24:33.472
is only gonna
get your kids killed.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.042
Damn it.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.551
Okay, judge just signed off
on T3 cellular

24:44.584 --> 24:47.153
and landline wiretap warrants
for both Rusty and Tobias.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.154
So, we'll know
if either family

24:48.187 --> 24:49.956
gets a ransom demand
from the kidnappers.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.158
Or if they try to conspire
to do anything illegal.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.726
Carter and Simone,
you tail Rusty.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.227
Laura, Brendon,
you tail Tobias.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.396
Now, remember, these are two
desperate, violent men.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.899
So let's stay close and act
quickly if something goes down.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.200
Copy that.
On it.

25:06.739 --> 25:09.141
Come on, Rusty, do something.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.243
At some point, you're going
to need to get used

25:11.277 --> 25:13.079
to the slow pace
of surveillance.

25:13.112 --> 25:16.415
What can I say?
I'm wired for action.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.986
<i>Tell me you got something.</i>

25:20.019 --> 25:22.088
<i>All the guys are out
searching, but nothing yet.</i>

25:22.121 --> 25:24.356
<i>Did you jack up
the West Side crew?</i>

25:24.390 --> 25:27.760
<i>Yeah, pulled some bits off.
They're not involved.</i>

25:27.794 --> 25:30.362
It's getting serious
out there.

25:30.396 --> 25:33.165
Oh. How was dinner
with the wifey?

25:33.199 --> 25:34.400
You never told me.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.735
Why would I tell you?

25:35.768 --> 25:38.204
Okay. Be like that.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.372
I could always sing
to pass the time.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.541
Please don't.

25:42.575 --> 25:45.244
Dinner was... great.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.046
Not according to
the look on your face.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.450
We didn't--

25:51.483 --> 25:53.419
We didn't even make it
into the restaurant.

25:53.452 --> 25:54.754
What happened?

25:56.756 --> 25:57.924
We're getting a divorce.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.860
Carter, I am so sorry.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.094
Can we not talk about it?

26:05.564 --> 26:06.565
<i>I don't care.</i>

26:06.599 --> 26:08.434
<i>Bust some heads,
pay some bribes,</i>

26:08.467 --> 26:10.569
<i>whatever you got to do
to find her, do it.</i>

26:10.603 --> 26:11.570
He's cracking.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.439
Tobias never would have said

26:13.472 --> 26:16.776
something like that
on a cellphone before.

26:17.977 --> 26:21.748
You know, this one time,
my best friend, Davey Pepper,

26:21.781 --> 26:23.950
stole all my Pokémon cards.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.718
He sold them
to buy a new bike.

26:25.752 --> 26:26.886
I was devastated.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.621
Are you seriously trying
to tell me a story

26:28.655 --> 26:31.724
from your childhood just to get
me to open up about Katie?

26:31.758 --> 26:33.793
Childhood?
It was, like, nine months ago.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.394
Remember what I said
about my personal business?

26:35.427 --> 26:37.396
I-I-I do.
But I also saw you earlier,

26:37.429 --> 26:39.799
and it looked like you might
explode out of your own skin,

26:39.832 --> 26:40.800
so...

26:42.101 --> 26:44.070
Well, that's because
Katie told me it was

26:44.103 --> 26:45.938
my fault
she cheated with my ex.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.008
Now they're engaged.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.076
What?
Yeah.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.011
Oh, my-- You destroyed her, right?

26:53.780 --> 26:56.849
I kind of...
congratulated her.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.184
You did what?

26:58.217 --> 26:59.618
During my sabbatical,
I did a deep dive

26:59.652 --> 27:02.154
into the latest scientific
literature on--

27:02.188 --> 27:03.756
on narcissists,
toxic personalities,

27:03.790 --> 27:05.191
psychopaths.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.960
Research, Laura,
that's-- that's, you know,

27:07.994 --> 27:09.095
one way to go about it.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.096
Yeah, it's my way.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.964
And it reminded me

27:11.998 --> 27:12.999
that you can't change
a toxic person.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.034
You just have to
stay positive

27:15.067 --> 27:18.104
and cut them out
of your life.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.105
So, you just... Yeah.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.007
Wished her well,
sent her on her way.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.374
It felt good.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.043
Laura, you got to get out
of your own head.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.311
You know,
you got to stop doing

27:25.344 --> 27:26.813
what all
the research tells you to do.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.147
And you got to be vulnerable.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.316
You got to--
You got to feel this.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.386
Oh, incoming
from Rusty's phone.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.355
<i>Yeah, who's this?</i>

27:36.388 --> 27:37.489
[ Distorted ] <i>If you ever
want to see your son again,</i>

27:37.523 --> 27:38.791
<i>it'll cost $2 million.</i>

27:38.825 --> 27:41.527
<i>I'll text you an address
to drop the money.</i>

27:41.560 --> 27:44.230
<i>Be there in two hours.</i>

27:44.263 --> 27:46.632
<i>How do I know he's still alive?</i>

27:46.665 --> 27:48.467
<i>Check your e-mail.</i>

27:54.040 --> 27:55.808
You seeing this, B.?

27:55.842 --> 27:57.176
Yeah, it's hardcore.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.878
You got two hours to try
and locate the kidnapers.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.646
Any chance to trace
the ransom call?

28:00.679 --> 28:03.249
No. They used a spoof
VOIP number.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.652
So Rusty's got a ransom demand,
but not Tobias?

28:06.685 --> 28:09.989
Maybe Kellen was the target
and Aliz was collateral.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.257
Or she might
already be dead.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.061
What are you doing?

28:15.094 --> 28:16.362
Little computer trick
I learned

28:16.395 --> 28:17.864
on the set of
"My Hard Drive Ate My Homework."

28:17.897 --> 28:20.066
If I isolate the background
in the ransom video,

28:20.099 --> 28:22.168
I can run a web search
for the photos

28:22.201 --> 28:23.435
with the exact same background.

28:23.469 --> 28:24.904
So it's like
facial recognition,

28:24.937 --> 28:26.238
but with objects
and architecture?

28:26.272 --> 28:28.507
Exactly.
If the room was posted online,

28:28.540 --> 28:29.575
it could get us
a location.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.010
I love it.
Keep going.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.578
Simone, Carter,
you stay with Rusty.

28:32.611 --> 28:33.846
You follow him
to that money drop.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.414
Kidnappers just lit a fuse,

28:35.447 --> 28:37.683
and we've got only two hours
to stop this explosion.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.724
We're at the drop.
Eyes on Rusty.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.269
Now what?
Now we gear up, get closer,

28:57.303 --> 28:59.105
and see who comes
to get the money.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.940
Yes, B.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.241
What?

29:02.274 --> 29:04.410
Brendon found the house
from the ransom video.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.145
FBI!

29:06.178 --> 29:07.479
- Cover right.
- Move, move, move!

29:07.513 --> 29:09.381
Go! Move in!

29:09.415 --> 29:10.917
- Watch your corner.
- Cover left, cover left.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.118
- Check the back.
- Go, go, go!

29:12.151 --> 29:14.653
Sweep the area.

29:17.489 --> 29:18.424
One down.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.967
Don't you move!

29:28.000 --> 29:29.335
- Facedown.
- Clear.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.302
Don't move!

29:30.336 --> 29:31.637
Hey.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.005
You find him?

29:35.474 --> 29:36.608
Help!

29:45.617 --> 29:47.719
In here! In here!
Help!

29:50.122 --> 29:53.159
- FBI! We're coming in!
- Hey! In here!

29:53.192 --> 29:54.861
Put your hands up!

29:54.894 --> 29:55.995
Yeah. Yeah.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.267
Where's Aliz?
I-I don't know.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.502
Th-They-- They took her
somewhere else.

30:10.910 --> 30:14.180
While we're waiting, shouldn't
we put a tracker in the bag?

30:14.213 --> 30:16.015
Just, you know,
in case they get away?

30:16.048 --> 30:18.350
In theory,
it's a good idea.
In theory?

30:18.384 --> 30:20.319
It would leave us exposed
without proper backup.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.888
Procedure is to identify
the kidnappers,

30:21.921 --> 30:23.055
initiate surveillance,

30:23.089 --> 30:24.523
and then follow them back
to their safe house.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.459
Right. But Brendon already
found the safe house,

30:27.493 --> 30:30.162
so we should be
slapping cuffs on guys, right?

30:42.674 --> 30:43.709
Okay.
Let's grab them.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.989
What do we do now?
Call for backup.

30:57.023 --> 30:57.990
You do that.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.225
Simone, wait.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.360
Shots fired. Shots fired.
Send backup.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.065
FBI!

31:06.098 --> 31:08.000
You are surrounded.

31:08.034 --> 31:11.403
Don't even think about
getting away on foot.

31:11.437 --> 31:16.208
I want to see guns on the ground
and hands in the air now!

31:26.618 --> 31:28.054
I did good, right?

31:34.093 --> 31:36.362
Here you go, buddy.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.763
Is Aliz okay?
We don't know.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.031
Can you tell us
what happened?

31:39.065 --> 31:40.732
We got separated
right away.

31:40.766 --> 31:43.435
Okay, they kept me blindfolded.
They wore masks.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.571
Do you think someone found out
about your relationship

31:45.604 --> 31:47.906
and used it as a way
to get a payday from both sides?

31:47.940 --> 31:50.876
No, okay?
Nobody knew about me and Aliz.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.979
We kept it secret, okay?

31:53.012 --> 31:55.114
We didn't even go out
in public together since we met.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.482
How did you guys meet?

31:56.515 --> 31:58.617
At Hard Road
a few months ago.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.153
Biker bar. Huh.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.122
That's a strange place
for her, huh?

32:03.155 --> 32:07.559
Yeah. I mean, she was--
she was out of place big time.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.728
But, you know, she was--
she was really cute about it.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.330
So I hit on her.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.465
Once I found out who she was,
I-I backed off.

32:13.499 --> 32:17.403
Okay? I knew my dad
would be pissed, but...

32:17.436 --> 32:19.671
That girl is--
She's--

32:19.705 --> 32:22.741
She's-- She's stubborn.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.276
You know, that's--
that's Aliz for you.

32:26.378 --> 32:27.446
He just lawyered up.

32:27.479 --> 32:30.149
That's four for four.
No one's talking.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.750
Definitely not your
run-of-the-mill kidnappers.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.285
This one looks like
he just got his braces off.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.653
I know. It's odd.

32:34.686 --> 32:37.256
None of them have ties or
records to either crime family.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.591
It's like they're just
straight out of suburbia.

32:39.625 --> 32:43.462
More like straight out of
Southern College of Los Angeles.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.964
I found the link
between the kidnappers.

32:45.998 --> 32:49.268
Dwayne here is a senior.
The other two just graduated.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.337
Aliz goes to SCLA.
That can't be a coincidence.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.938
Well, maybe they found out
who her father was

32:52.971 --> 32:54.506
and they thought
they could make a quick buck.

32:54.540 --> 32:55.674
And Kellen
is just collateral

32:55.707 --> 32:57.109
that ended up
being worth something.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.345
Maybe,
but my daddy always said,

32:59.378 --> 33:02.548
when something don't seem right,
turn on the light.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.715
I take it
you have a theory?

33:03.749 --> 33:05.117
No, more of a question.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.119
How does Aliz,
a spoiled princess,

33:07.153 --> 33:09.988
go from d-arties
to biker bars?

33:10.022 --> 33:12.291
D-arties--
That's a day party.

33:12.324 --> 33:16.362
Little Miss Aliz may not be
as innocent as she seems.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.364
<i>The FBI arrested several men,</i>

33:18.397 --> 33:20.532
<i>averting what was
a tense standoff earlier--</i>

33:22.068 --> 33:24.070
You said there was no way your
families would involve the cops.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.504
They wouldn't.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.673
The cops got onto this
some other way.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.742
Do you think
the others will talk?

33:30.776 --> 33:33.079
Eventually, yeah.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.514
But none of them know
I'm in on it, right?

33:35.547 --> 33:37.716
No, they all think
it was my idea.

33:37.749 --> 33:38.950
Good.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.556
Please no.
I have to.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.692
No.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.344
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

34:05.377 --> 34:08.280
Help.
Um, this is Aliz Kazan.

34:08.314 --> 34:11.217
I wa-- I was kidnapped,
but I got free.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.585
Uh, he stabbed me.

34:13.619 --> 34:14.886
So I grabbed his g--

34:14.920 --> 34:17.022
I grabbed his gun.
I, um--

34:17.055 --> 34:20.726
I shot him.
I shot him.

34:20.759 --> 34:24.296
Please help me. Please.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.532
Hey, hold up.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.767
Can we see the vic?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.402
What is it?

34:30.436 --> 34:33.305
I've seen this guy before.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.145
She knew her kidnapper.

34:45.651 --> 34:49.755
Miss Kazan, we're with the FBI.
I'm so glad you're safe.

34:49.788 --> 34:50.989
It was awful.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.624
I'm sure it was.

34:52.658 --> 34:55.093
We ID'd your kidnapper,
the-- the man you killed.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.628
He came at me
with a knife.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.397
His name
is Tony Eakins.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.232
Did you know him?

35:00.266 --> 35:02.634
No. I never met him
before in my life.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.838
Any idea why he abducted you
or your boyfriend?

35:06.872 --> 35:08.274
Because our dads
are rich.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.309
And you sure you've
never seen him before?

35:12.178 --> 35:15.347
Aliz, honey,
let me give you some advice.

35:15.381 --> 35:18.450
The next time
you decide to lie,

35:18.484 --> 35:21.587
scrub your socials first.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.156
I guess it's easier
to kill somebody

35:24.190 --> 35:27.025
if you pretend
like you don't remember them.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.361
Same as it is
if you say you love them

35:29.395 --> 35:32.531
and don't even ask
about how they doing.

35:32.564 --> 35:35.434
'Cause, see, the first thing
that little Kellen boy did

35:35.467 --> 35:37.536
was ask about you.

35:37.569 --> 35:38.770
I'm in shock.

35:38.804 --> 35:39.971
I would be too,

35:40.005 --> 35:41.973
if I killed somebody
to keep from going to jail.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.309
Out of my way.
She's my daughter.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.477
Don't say another word.
Stand back.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.480
Your daughter is the prime
suspect in her own kidnapping

35:48.514 --> 35:50.982
and the kidnapping
of Kellen Filmore.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.652
And for the murder
of Tony Eakins.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.794
Wait.

36:02.828 --> 36:06.131
You two were in my restaurant
the other day.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.966
Watching on us
this whole time?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.401
Is this what this
is about?

36:09.435 --> 36:11.203
You coming after
my business?

36:11.237 --> 36:15.040
That is all you care about--
your business!

36:15.073 --> 36:16.875
You're always all,
"I grew up with nothing.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.844
And you should learn
the value of hard work."

36:18.877 --> 36:20.679
You wanted me
to earn my own money?

36:20.712 --> 36:22.881
Well, guess what?

36:22.914 --> 36:24.850
I did.

36:24.883 --> 36:29.154
Whoops. That right there
is what we call a confession.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.390
And that means
you're under arrest.

36:37.095 --> 36:40.165
You came at me
through my kid.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.166
I won't forget that.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.502
Your kid
made her own bed.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.837
If I were you, I'd get her
a really good lawyer.

37:04.290 --> 37:08.927
The AD says Bob's plaque's
gonna go right here.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.897
Wish we could have taken down
Tobias in his honor.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.632
Yeah, well,
it wasn't all a bust.

37:13.665 --> 37:14.866
Laura was right.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.435
Because of
the kidnapping chaos,

37:16.468 --> 37:18.870
Tobias's crew had to reroute
the fentanyl delivery.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.439
Yeah, our wiretaps
caught one of his guys

37:20.472 --> 37:21.773
making a call
he shouldn't have.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.109
DEA nabbed the shipment
coming over the border.

37:24.142 --> 37:28.580
As far as Rusty and Tobias go,
we'll get them one day.

37:28.614 --> 37:32.751
Listen, even though we didn't
get our intended targets,

37:32.784 --> 37:35.621
this was still one hell
of a successful op today.

37:35.654 --> 37:39.090
Technically, the--
the op started yesterday

37:39.124 --> 37:41.293
or the day before.

37:41.327 --> 37:43.295
How many days have we been up?

37:43.329 --> 37:45.997
I don't know.
But I'm ready to lay down.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.600
Well, all of you go home.
Get some rest.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.442
You okay?

37:56.475 --> 37:58.109
One day, you're an agent
in the field.

37:58.143 --> 38:01.246
The next, you are a ghost
on a wall.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.148
Mm.

38:03.181 --> 38:04.650
The life we lead.

38:04.683 --> 38:05.651
You're deflecting.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.820
Maybe.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.922
At least I'm not dwelling
on my health issues, right?

38:12.223 --> 38:14.660
Still eating healthy.
I'm managing my stress.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.430
My heart is good.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.098
Speaking of,
how's yours?

38:20.131 --> 38:22.801
You know,
the whole Katie situation.

38:26.237 --> 38:27.373
What is she, a witch?

38:27.406 --> 38:29.040
Yeah, with a "B."

38:29.074 --> 38:30.609
She's waiting for me.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.210
I asked her
to come back.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.450
Hey.
Surprised you called.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.452
Yeah, me too.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.054
But I realized
you were right.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.624
I am obsessive
when it comes to work.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.460
And that doesn't always
leave space for friends

38:48.494 --> 38:52.498
or lovers or...
anyone, really.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.999
Laura, I am so happy

38:54.032 --> 38:56.134
you're finally starting
to be honest with yourself.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.703
Well, hold up,
'cause that honesty

38:57.736 --> 39:00.171
is about to get directed
right at <i>you.</i>

39:00.205 --> 39:03.341
You were a horrible friend.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.511
The absolute worst.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.479
And not just because
you cheated with Sam

39:07.513 --> 39:10.215
behind my back
for over a year.

39:10.248 --> 39:12.818
We grew up together.
Each other's ride-or-die.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.487
And if you saw me
losing connection
with my relationships,

39:15.521 --> 39:18.824
then why the hell
didn't you ever just tell me?!

39:18.857 --> 39:19.891
Because
you wouldn't listen.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.528
Oh, well, we'll never
know now, will we?

39:22.561 --> 39:24.396
I do want to thank you

39:24.430 --> 39:27.365
because I will never,
ever let someone like you

39:27.399 --> 39:29.501
into my life ever again.

39:29.535 --> 39:32.438
Oh, and do you know
what came of me being obsessive

39:32.471 --> 39:33.939
when it comes to work?

39:33.972 --> 39:36.608
I became a genius profiler
of human psyche.

39:36.642 --> 39:39.678
So trust me
when I say this--

39:39.711 --> 39:42.347
Cheaters always cheat.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.782
Good luck with Sam.

39:51.657 --> 39:52.758
Too much?

39:54.460 --> 39:56.027
Awesome.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.763
Did it feel awesome?

39:57.796 --> 39:58.630
Didn't suck.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.001
Thank you.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.006
Hey.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.743
How you holding up?

40:11.777 --> 40:12.744
I'm fine.

40:21.086 --> 40:24.490
Look, you don't want
to talk to me, that's cool,

40:24.523 --> 40:26.825
but you need
to talk to <i>somebody.</i>

40:26.858 --> 40:31.196
Even amicable divorces
can be emotional chainsaws.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.601
It's my son
I'm worried about.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.006
How do we tell him?

40:43.341 --> 40:45.577
Carter, I worked with kids
for 20 years,

40:45.611 --> 40:50.248
and they understand a lot more
than we think they do.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.684
Be honest with the boy.

40:52.718 --> 40:55.487
Tell him the truth.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.756
Love him.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.025
