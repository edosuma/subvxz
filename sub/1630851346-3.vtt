different, you think?

27:06.486 --> 27:07.453

that I’m going [bleep] her up
in the head.

27:10.156 --> 27:11.080
- I get that,

27:11.080 --> 27:13.684
but if you live your life
in that frame of mind,

27:13.684 --> 27:16.080
you’re just limiting yourself.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.552
And I think that’s the worst.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.552
My mom was a teen mom.
She struggled.

27:19.552 --> 27:23.684
You have people around her
that will be healthy for her

27:23.684 --> 27:27.156

28:43.354 --> 28:45.486
Night, night. Look.

28:48.321 --> 28:50.882
- So who was that boy you were
with today out in my yard

28:50.882 --> 28:54.816
when I was leaving to go
to work, with that truck?

28:54.816 --> 28:56.288
- You already know.
[giggles]

28:56.288 --> 28:57.915
- What’s his name, Rachel?

28:57.915 --> 29:00.783
- Koty.
[giggles]

29:00.783 --> 29:02.519
- What you doing
with Koty, Rachel?

29:02.519 --> 29:04.684
- Well, we’re not back
together, but we’re talking.

29:04.684 --> 29:08.750
- How many days have you hung
out with him in the past week?

29:08.750 --> 29:11.519
- [giggles]
Every day, probably.

29:11.519 --> 29:14.750
- So what are you trying to do?
- I don’t know.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.816
I’m just chilling,
but at the same time,

29:16.816 --> 29:18.453
we’re trying to work things out
for the better.

29:18.453 --> 29:21.684
- I really hate y’all together.
Y’all are always damn fighting.

29:21.684 --> 29:23.750
I think it bothers me out
because I always worry

29:23.750 --> 29:24.948
that you’ll come crying to me
about it.

29:24.948 --> 29:27.651
I’ll try to save you, and then
you start fighting with me.

29:27.651 --> 29:28.948
- Back then,
it was just the wrong time,

29:28.948 --> 29:31.255
but I feel like
we’ve both grown since then.

29:31.255 --> 29:32.080
It’s been over a year.

29:32.080 --> 29:35.288
Like, I care about him more as
my baby’s father, that’s gone,

29:35.288 --> 29:39.288
than I do Drew, that is
the baby’s father that’s here.

29:39.288 --> 29:42.750
Like, we both used to argue
a lot, but I feel like

29:42.750 --> 29:45.321
we can change it for the better
if that’s really what we want.

29:45.321 --> 29:49.486

what he wants, so...

30:17.589 --> 30:20.622

than I expected it to go.

30:20.622 --> 30:21.325
She said that,

30:21.325 --> 30:23.787
"I don’t even just want
a relationship with Amour.

30:23.787 --> 30:25.754
I would like to build
a relationship with you."

30:25.754 --> 30:27.490
She was like,
"It don’t have to be now.

30:27.490 --> 30:28.457
"It could be in three months,

30:28.457 --> 30:30.490

30:30.490 --> 30:32.863

Amour would be, what?

30:32.863 --> 30:34.325
Four?
- Four. Yeah.

30:34.325 --> 30:35.292
I told her that I would try--

30:35.292 --> 30:37.721
to definitely try
to make more of an effort

30:37.721 --> 30:39.490
to make sure that
they see each other.

30:39.490 --> 30:42.721
- I don’t trust her.
You have to deal with that.

30:42.721 --> 30:43.721
I don’t have to deal with ’em.

30:43.721 --> 30:45.896
She can have a relationship
with you

30:45.896 --> 30:48.424
on the strength of,
you know, our grandbaby,

30:48.424 --> 30:51.358
but I’m kind of done
when it comes to that.

30:51.358 --> 30:53.556

30:53.556 --> 30:57.863
Zay has my name tatted
on his hand.

30:58.622 --> 31:01.259

about it at all?

31:01.259 --> 31:02.863
- No, I did not.

31:04.226 --> 31:05.688
- Are you going to ask him
about it?

31:05.688 --> 31:07.556
- Any answer that I get
is like,

31:07.556 --> 31:08.589
what is it gonna do for me?

31:08.589 --> 31:11.721
I just rather leave it alone.
- Yeah.

31:11.721 --> 31:15.995
- I just rather, just...
- Mm-hmm.

31:15.995 --> 31:17.226
<i>- It don’t be adding up.</i>

31:17.226 --> 31:19.226
He tattooed you, and you
don’t know the reason why?

31:19.226 --> 31:21.995
<i>Don’t nobody just
put your name on his skin</i>

31:21.995 --> 31:23.424
