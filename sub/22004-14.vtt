WEBVTT

00:22.323 --> 00:24.192
It's Erica.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.729
I can't talk long;
I think someone's after me.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.848
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:47.881 --> 00:50.451
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

00:50.484 --> 00:53.154
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:53.187 --> 00:54.255
* How, how, how, how

00:54.288 --> 00:56.624
* Hey, hey

01:02.530 --> 01:04.098
* You gotta come on.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.702
TAYLOR:
New Orleans is a city

01:08.736 --> 01:11.872
rich in tradition,
rich in culture.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.142
It's also rich in corruption.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.377
Which is why
this special election

01:16.410 --> 01:20.481
is a chance to move past the
same old way of doing things,

01:20.514 --> 01:24.618
as my opponent Mr. Butler
champions, and instead

01:24.652 --> 01:27.255
move forward into a new dawn.

01:27.288 --> 01:30.324
One that includes all citizens,

01:30.358 --> 01:32.826
not just the select few
who have profited

01:32.860 --> 01:35.363
at the city's expense
for too long.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.465
That's why I need your vote.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.733
Thank you.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.404
WOMAN:
Please, ladies and gentlemen,

01:43.437 --> 01:46.274
let's thank the two candidates
for joining us here today

01:46.307 --> 01:48.542
at the Bourbon Orleans Hotel.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.413
Latest polling shows
us ahead in Lakeview,

01:52.446 --> 01:54.482
but Butler's leading Uptown
and in the Garden District.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.917
This is why I keep saying that
we can't just rely on the media.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.752
Volunteers have got to go
door-to-door, too.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.589
It's hard to get anybody to
go door-to-door right now.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.457
City's packed.
Why they would pick

02:03.491 --> 02:05.459
a special election
during Mardi Gras--

02:05.493 --> 02:06.427
what were they thinking?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.462
Lower turnout.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.930
Rig Butler for the win.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.765
It's why we need a new mayor,
Loretta.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.203
Please don't tell me
we've got a case.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.338
We got a case.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.207
Thought I'd pick
you up on the way.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.208
:
Sorry.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.842
Arthur,

02:21.875 --> 02:23.611
I'm counting on you.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.313
We've only got two days,

02:25.346 --> 02:27.315
and Zahra needs
every vote she can get.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.349
I know, I know.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.450
Brought chicory.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.651
Thought you might need some.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.820
It's got rum in it?

02:32.853 --> 02:35.956
Kidding, sort of.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.825
My support.
Thank you. Hi.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.427
WADE:
Ah, this is hard, Dwayne.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.961
I can't do two
jobs at once.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.596
I don't know what
I was thinking.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.399
You were thinking about more
than just yourself, as usual.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.600
Getting Zahra elected,

02:46.634 --> 02:48.769
moving past the damage
Hamilton's done

02:48.802 --> 02:50.538
is a worthy cause.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.473
Why would anyone
want to reelect

02:52.506 --> 02:55.209
someone like Hamilton
again is beyond me.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.777
Old money and influence
goes deep in this town,

02:56.810 --> 02:57.978
you know that.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.947
Makes change
that much more difficult

02:59.980 --> 03:01.949
and that much
more important.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.285
Dwayne, Dr. Wade.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.387
Haven't seen you around in
a while. What brings you here?

03:06.420 --> 03:08.322
Wait, don't tell me

03:08.356 --> 03:10.458
that you're a Taylor supporter,
you'll break my heart.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.926
I'm a federal agent, Ron.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.862
You know I'm not allowed
to take sides.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.297
Come on, Dwayne,

03:16.330 --> 03:17.698
who are you kidding?

03:17.731 --> 03:21.269
We both know who brought down
Hamilton and why.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.336
You know Vernon Butler,
don't you?

03:22.370 --> 03:23.604
Of course.
Yeah.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.373
Used to work for Dwayne's daddy,
didn't you?

03:25.406 --> 03:26.707
That's right.
Ah.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.609
Heard old Cassius
is out of prison.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.444
Yeah.
How's he doing, anyway?

03:30.478 --> 03:31.445
I wouldn't know.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.482
Excuse us.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.820
Doesn't Cook own half
the TV stations in this town?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.755
Yeah.
Supposed to be unbiased.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.425
Talk about old money
and influence.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.660
All the reason to get Zahra
elected, sooner the better.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.665
Chris, Gregorio, morning.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.534
What do we got?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.369
Train versus human,
never ends well.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.338
Victim's Chief Erica Croft,

03:57.371 --> 03:59.307
cryptologic
technician interpreter

03:59.340 --> 04:00.574
based out of D.C.

04:00.608 --> 04:03.344
Engineer said he
came through on the 6:55.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.580
Said it all happened so fast,
she stumbled onto the tracks.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.550
Thought it was just another
drunken Mardi Gras accident.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.984
GREGORIO: Except Erica
wasn't here to play.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.553
I just got off the phone
with her C.O.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.822
Said she came into town
to polish up on her Arabic

04:14.855 --> 04:17.425
at the refugee center
down on Lakefront.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.461
CTIs translate
foreign communications,

04:20.494 --> 04:24.432
intercept counterterrorism
intel.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.367
What are you thinking, King?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.701
What if this wasn't an accident?

04:27.735 --> 04:29.002
LASALLE:
Then it's possible

04:29.036 --> 04:30.904
it's not a training mission,
either.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.540
SEBASTIAN: Well, it definitely
wasn't an accident.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.841
Found what could be
the victim's phone

04:33.874 --> 04:35.376
in the gravel over there.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.510
Probably slid away
during the fight.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.045
In addition to that,

04:38.078 --> 04:40.581
I found, uh,
two sets of shoe prints

04:40.614 --> 04:42.583
scuffling in the dirt
by the tracks.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.085
Uh, I also found blood and hair
on the ground and on the pipes.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.520
I'm gonna go out
on a limb and guess

04:46.554 --> 04:47.555
that it's not
just the victim's.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.022
Means if Erica
was in a fight,

04:49.056 --> 04:50.524
she could have been pushed.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.626
Yeah, I'll run DNA,
try to ID the second person.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.728
Uh, by the way,
where is, uh, Percy?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.464
Yeah, where's Percy?
I don't know.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.931
She's taking some personal time.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.433
What does that mean

04:59.467 --> 05:00.601
Yeah, sure, she's fine.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.003
You know, personal's personal.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.538
PRIDE:
Why don't we just,
uh, focus on the case.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.806
We need to find out
who would want to kill

05:05.839 --> 05:07.475
a CTI specialist and why.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.410
You afraid she might have gotten
wind of a terrorist attack?

05:09.443 --> 05:10.478
I don't know.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.880
But no denying that
the tricentennial Mardi Gras

05:12.913 --> 05:14.648
is a potentially prime target.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.949
Especially with
hundreds of events

05:15.983 --> 05:17.050
going on all around the city.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.586
And an upcoming election.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.954
Loretta, I got this.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.023
I know that you're
swamped, but, uh...

05:23.056 --> 05:25.726
Don't worry. I am going
to do your autopsy first.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.561
Just keep the chicory coming.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.630
You got it.
Chris, Gregorio,

05:29.663 --> 05:31.565
why don't you head over
to the refugee center.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.634
See if you can find out
who Erica was talking with.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.536
Keep a low profile.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.671
Don't want to presume guilt,
and don't want any of them

05:37.705 --> 05:40.073
to be more nervous than they
already are just being here.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.509
Copy that.
Yeah.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.910
Sebastian, with me.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.712
Need you to track
Erica's contacts

05:44.745 --> 05:46.614
while I get Patton
to see if he can

05:46.647 --> 05:48.616
pick up any local
terrorist chatter.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.551
Come on, people.
Let's learn things fast!

05:52.620 --> 05:53.887
MAN:
Many refugees from many
countries stay here.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.524
The church welcomes
all who need.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.626
Although I specifically work
with those from Syria.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.760
How many are here?

05:59.793 --> 06:01.395
Uh, it changes,

06:01.429 --> 06:02.663
but usually
around 20 to 30.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.565
Erica befriended
many of them.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.967
They helped her with her Arabic
and she helped them cope,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.002
feel safe.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.871
News of her death
will hit them hard.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.644
We're not here to cast
suspicion, Mr. Petro,

06:16.677 --> 06:18.011
but we do need to try

06:18.045 --> 06:20.781
and find out who wanted
Erica Croft killed and why.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.016
Which casts suspicion,
whether you mean to or not.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.952
They know how they're
perceived, Agent Lasalle.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.820
They know how fear and
ignorance can cause many

06:26.854 --> 06:28.656
to assume they're
all radicals,

06:28.689 --> 06:31.792
terrorists, but I can
assure you they are not.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.794
Okay, but when a victim
who specializes

06:33.827 --> 06:36.564
in intercepting
counterintelligence is murdered,

06:36.597 --> 06:38.165
we have to check it out.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.534
Yeah, especially when that
victim was apparently

06:40.568 --> 06:42.670
on the phone with somebody here
just before she died.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.972
Sebastian just
traced her last call

06:45.005 --> 06:46.674
to a burner phone that was
purchased by the church.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.176
Call ended abruptly at 6:55.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.679
We provide refugees with
cell phones for emergencies,

06:51.712 --> 06:53.747
also so we can stay in contact
if they get lost.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.517
Yeah, well,
we got to find one of them

06:56.550 --> 06:58.652
because now they're
a potential witness.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.790
Noora! It's Petro.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.458
You sure you got
the right person?

07:04.492 --> 07:05.626
If your agent's right
about the serial number,

07:05.659 --> 07:07.661
the phone's assigned to Noora.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.664
NCIS.

07:10.698 --> 07:11.932
They're not here
to hurt you, Noora.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.667
They just want to ask
about Erica.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.703
No, I can't talk.
You don't have a choice.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.605
Freeze. Freeze.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.672
LASALLE:
Back up, back up.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.773
I'm going after him.

07:19.807 --> 07:20.908
GREGORIO:
Don't move.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.142
Stay back, Petro.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.688
He got away.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.223
Why are you
arresting her?

07:36.256 --> 07:37.658
One, because that
was her son, Sharif.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.759
And two, check
out the cabinet.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.969
Jihadi flag.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.671
Yeah. Keep looking.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.178
Reading up on making bombs.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.783
Looks like Erica really did
stumble across something.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.017
Yeah, and if that's true,
then it means

08:04.051 --> 08:05.686
we got a terrorist on the loose.

08:27.908 --> 08:28.942
LASALLE:
It's hard for us

08:28.976 --> 08:31.579
to believe you didn't know
this was in your closet.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.946
I'm telling
you the truth.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.247
I did not know.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.683
Why would I lie?

08:35.716 --> 08:38.251
I don't want to be deported.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.921
Mrs. Saadi, being deported's
the least of your problems.

08:40.954 --> 08:45.092
A counterterrorism specialist
calls you, gets killed.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.094
LASALLE:
Then we come and
knock on your door,

08:47.127 --> 08:50.798
your son runs... and we find out
he's researching bombs.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.866
GREGORIO:
The only way to help yourself
is to help us stop

08:52.900 --> 08:54.635
whatever it is
Sharif's planning.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.604
I'm telling you the truth.
Sharif is not planning

08:56.637 --> 08:57.871
to hurt anybody.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.306
Well, it looks
like he hurt Erica.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.575
Killed her
when she found him out.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.843
She was my friend.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.612
Erica called me

09:04.645 --> 09:06.346
because she was worried
about Sharif.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.616
Worried that people were trying
to force him

09:08.649 --> 09:10.751
to do something he did not
want to do.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.152
Then why'd he run from us?

09:12.185 --> 09:14.054
He was afraid.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.725
We all are.

09:17.758 --> 09:21.895
You judge us with your eyes,
you decide before you know.

09:23.030 --> 09:26.967
Sharif hates the radicals.

09:28.301 --> 09:33.040
They killed his father,
my husband.

09:36.944 --> 09:40.147
That's why we came here.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.956
Was Sharif with you
when Erica called?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.191
No.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.927
Mrs. Saadi, if what
you say is true,

09:53.961 --> 09:55.228
Sharif's involved
in something,

09:55.262 --> 09:56.930
and if it's a threat,

09:56.964 --> 09:59.066
we have to do everything
in our power to stop it.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.302
Which is why we need you
to help us find Sharif.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.905
Not only so we can stop
the attack,

10:04.938 --> 10:06.306
but to save him, too.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.908
Save him to what?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.142
Arrest him?

10:09.176 --> 10:11.645
Take him away from me
so I have nothing?

10:11.679 --> 10:14.782
Sharif is all I have left.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.953
I will not help you find my son.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.892
PRIDE:
Keep me posted, Raymond.

10:24.925 --> 10:28.395
Yeah. Every agency should be
coordinating intel right now.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.998
I'm hoping you got something
out of the mother,

10:31.031 --> 10:32.800
because DHS and FBI

10:32.833 --> 10:34.935
haven't heard anything.
Patton not able
to pick up

10:34.968 --> 10:36.236
on local chatter?
No.

10:36.269 --> 10:39.006
Could mean that Sharif's
in this alone, or...

10:39.039 --> 10:41.942
Or whoever he's involved
with is done talking,

10:41.975 --> 10:43.944
and the attack's imminent.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.348
Sharif's mom give you
anything to go on?

10:48.381 --> 10:50.017
She's scared.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.185
Doesn't trust us.
Yeah, but I
get this sense

10:52.219 --> 10:54.421
that she wants to-- she
just doesn't know how.

10:54.454 --> 10:57.891
Problem is, her son's
life just might depend
on her trusting us.

10:57.925 --> 10:58.792
Not to mention,
we got to figure out

10:58.826 --> 11:00.928
where the attack's gonna be.
Well, with all

11:00.961 --> 11:02.162
the Mardi Gras events happening,
that's gonna be

11:02.195 --> 11:03.764
like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

11:03.797 --> 11:04.932
Only way to figure out
what's really going on

11:04.965 --> 11:06.867
is to find Sharif.
Or...

11:06.900 --> 11:07.868
his recruiter.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.036
I mean, if the
mom's right

11:09.069 --> 11:11.772
and Erica called and said
Sharif was being forced into it,

11:11.805 --> 11:12.906
he can't be working alone.

11:12.940 --> 11:16.777
This kid loses his father,
flees from a war-torn country,

11:16.810 --> 11:19.079
he's lost, angry--
certainly fits the profile

11:19.112 --> 11:21.715
of somebody who's open
to being recruited.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.284
Yeah, but we have
zero leads to follow.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.820
We got Noora.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.757
She's got to know
where Sharif is.
Right.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.224
But... I get the feeling

11:31.258 --> 11:34.461
she's not gonna trust
anyone with a badge, King.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.831
Then we have to find somebody
who doesn't have one.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.902
*

11:41.935 --> 11:45.038
Funny, I was just
about to call you, Dwayne.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.940
Okay, but first I need to...

11:46.974 --> 11:48.041
Uh, hold that thought.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.409
Arthur, I'm sorry,

11:49.442 --> 11:51.779
I can't talk to you
right now. What?

11:51.812 --> 11:54.147
No. Zahra absolutely
must get to that meeting.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.883
Call Estes.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.285
Use a police escort
if you have to. Okay.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.519
Sorry about that.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.154
Uh, so, where were we?

12:01.188 --> 12:03.390
Ah. The victim.
Uh...

12:03.423 --> 12:06.526
So, I still haven't been able
to differentiate

12:06.559 --> 12:10.063
any of the injuries
from the train or the attacker.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.832
But... fortunately,

12:11.865 --> 12:14.234
Erica's lungs were
a bit more forthcoming.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.003
How so?

12:16.036 --> 12:18.005
I found this unusual
tar-based substance

12:18.038 --> 12:20.473
in her left alveoli.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.075
Trachea, too.
Meaning?

12:22.109 --> 12:24.077
Meaning that she
must have inhaled it

12:24.111 --> 12:26.413
within an hour of her death--
otherwise her system

12:26.446 --> 12:27.514
would have absorbed it.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.116
Metabolized.
Should help us

12:29.149 --> 12:30.851
narrow down
Erica's last whereabouts.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.786
Yeah, likely help us ID
her killer, too,

12:32.820 --> 12:34.187
if she crossed paths
with him there.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.255
Any chance
you can expedite the...?

12:35.288 --> 12:36.489
SEBASTIAN:
The analysis?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.025
Oh, yeah. We're already on it.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.326
After all,
we got a campaign to run.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.061
And by "we,"
I mean... I mean you.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.197
Sorry. I'm just really caught up
in all the excitement, you know?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.099
And stress, anxiety, pressure.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.968
Sebastian!
All right.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.037
Dokha. That's...

12:50.070 --> 12:51.238
that's what was found
in Erica's lungs.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.372
Do-Dokha.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.107
Uh, it's a rare tobacco blend.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.509
It's more commonly found
in the Middle East.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.111
The high levels
of concentration suggest

12:58.145 --> 13:00.113
she inhaled it
in a closed room.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.148
You mean like a car

13:01.181 --> 13:03.250
or apartment...?
Hookah lounge.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.451
EinCarim Cafe.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.854
It's a block away
from the tracks.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.956
We saw it when we were doing
our perimeter search.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.157
Ok-Okay, go
check it out.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.992
Thanks, Sebastian.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.129
Oh. Sorry, Dwayne.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.430
I know you called me.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.532
Was there something you needed?

13:19.566 --> 13:21.501
Just your help...

13:21.534 --> 13:23.837
saving the city.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.873
If you got a minute.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.608
NOORA:
You don't look like police.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.211
Are you?

13:31.244 --> 13:33.613
:
Far from it.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.916
:
Ah, I hate...

13:35.949 --> 13:37.885
guns, violence.

13:37.918 --> 13:41.388
Partly, I suppose, because
I see too much of it every day.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.991
I'm a doctor.
Coroner.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.625
But I don't understand.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.527
Why did the agents call you?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.496
What do you want from me?

13:49.529 --> 13:54.534
I don't want to see your son
ending up on one of my tables.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.304
And believe it or not,
nor do the agents.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.506
And that's why they called me.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.043
Uh, would you like some?

14:03.076 --> 14:05.245
Tea, maybe?

14:07.647 --> 14:11.318
We had a bakery in Damascus,
my husband and I.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.621
We were hoping

14:14.654 --> 14:17.490
Sharif would
take it over one day.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.894
Noora, I'm not
gonna lie to you.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.234
Time is not your friend here.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.937
If what you say is true,

14:29.970 --> 14:33.340
then both your son
and the city's
in terrible trouble--

14:33.373 --> 14:36.176
unless you help
the agents find him.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.979
But they will take him
away from me forever.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.113
Perhaps.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.315
But at least no one else
will be hurt,

14:42.349 --> 14:44.017
and Sharif will live.

14:44.051 --> 14:47.587
Can you say the same
for those who are forcing him?

14:47.620 --> 14:50.290
Do you think that they
will not sacrifice his life

14:50.323 --> 14:52.225
for their cause?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.594
I have a cause, too,

14:54.627 --> 14:56.663
one that I believe in
with all my heart,

14:56.696 --> 15:01.568
but one that is the opposite
of those using your son.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.570
I want to elect a mayor

15:03.603 --> 15:07.074
who believes in including
all the people,

15:07.107 --> 15:09.542
not just the privileged
and those in power.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.945
But those from everywhere,

15:11.979 --> 15:14.614
no matter who they are
or what they are.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.017
Like you and Sharif.

15:18.718 --> 15:22.689
You came to this country...

15:22.722 --> 15:26.593
for a chance at a better life
for you and Sharif.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.297
Help us find Sharif.

15:30.330 --> 15:35.268
Help us stop the attack
by helping us find your son.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.276
Don't get a lot of
Navy types in here.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.544
Not exactly sure what
you're looking for.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.279
How about
a gas mask?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.315
Just need to see
your surveillance tapes.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.084
You said you were open
24 hours a day, right?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.153
Yeah, but we just
keep the last seven
days on cloud storage.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.622
Only need to see
around 6:00 this morning.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.590
MAN :
...Sharif.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.232
We were actually pretty busy
this morning.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.167
Not unusual for Mardi Gras.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.570
Late-night partiers,
early morning risers,
businessmen.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.704
What time did you say again?

16:11.738 --> 16:12.739
Just keep rewinding.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.207
We'll tell you
when to stop.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.277
So, when's Percy
coming back?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.546
I don't know.
She said she needed
some time to think.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.081
Think about what?

16:21.114 --> 16:23.350
Life. Is this the time
or the place?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.285
It's just a question.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.220
GREGORIO:
Wait. Stop right there.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.657
That's Erica

16:30.690 --> 16:33.226
14 minutes
before she died.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.362
Hey, can you
highlight that grid?

16:37.264 --> 16:38.431
LASALLE:
She a regular here?

16:38.465 --> 16:40.233
First time I've seen her.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.668
What is she doing?
She's just sitting there

16:41.701 --> 16:43.603
by herself.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.140
I think that's
Sharif behind her.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.409
Looks like she's eavesdropping.

16:51.611 --> 16:55.248
GREGORIO:
Sharif's trying to stop the guy
from following her.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.049
Could be Erica's killer.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.817
We just passed that guy
out there.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.619
I heard him talking
about Sharif.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.155
He's gone.
Yeah, well, we'd
better find him fast,

17:02.189 --> 17:04.124
because if King doesn't
find Sharif either...

17:04.157 --> 17:05.825
All right, I'll take
the pipe for prints.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.195
NOORA:
He should be here any minute.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.297
You promise

17:10.330 --> 17:12.332
you will not arrest my son?

17:12.365 --> 17:13.666
Loretta?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.502
Noora, now,
we talked about this.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.670
Dwayne has a job to do,
a city to protect--

17:17.704 --> 17:20.207
he has to take Sharif in
for questioning.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.309
But if you're right
about him being innocent,

17:22.342 --> 17:24.344
then neither one of you have
anything to worry about.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.846
In fact, if he ends up
helping us stop the attack...

17:26.879 --> 17:28.448
Then Sharif
will be a hero.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.650
And I guarantee
Mayor Taylor will do

17:30.683 --> 17:33.620
everything she can to help you
both become permanent residents.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.555
If she gets elected.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.458
She learns fast.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.826
I see that.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.397
Sharif!

17:46.333 --> 17:48.735
Mama. Mama.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.445
Thanks for helping out.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.281
I-I know you're
crazed right now...

18:01.314 --> 18:03.316
Noora!

18:05.752 --> 18:07.587
(Noora screaming,
men shouting in Arabic)

18:22.602 --> 18:24.171
Are you all right?
Sharif!

18:24.204 --> 18:26.306
You have to stop them!
You have to save him!

18:26.339 --> 18:28.575
He said they were going
to make him kill your mayor!

18:28.608 --> 18:30.243
Wait, Zahra?

18:30.277 --> 18:33.146
*

18:46.759 --> 18:49.329
Appreciate anything
you can do.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.864
BOLO's out on the van.
Didn't have any plates.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.900
I need you to
pull surveillance.
First things first.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.702
Are you all right
Yeah.

18:55.735 --> 18:56.903
We're both fine.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.605
Noora's in shock.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.240
Loretta's gonna ride
with her to the hospital

19:00.273 --> 19:01.841
so she won't be alone.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.411
Poor girl.
She's probably scared to death.
She is.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.346
But Noora was right
about Sharif--

19:06.379 --> 19:08.415
he's not doing
any of this voluntarily.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.217
They forced him into the van.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.519
But he wouldn't let 'em
hurt his mother.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.587
That's pretty consistent.
I mean, clearly, he was trying

19:14.621 --> 19:17.224
to save Erica this morning
at the bar, too.
Obviously

19:17.257 --> 19:18.791
not a radical-- ISIS is known

19:18.825 --> 19:20.427
to seduce prospects
without knowing their cause.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.695
Once they get onto it
and want out, it's too late.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.896
Yep, forced
recruitment.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.532
Could be Sharif had no idea

19:25.565 --> 19:26.966
what he was
getting himself into.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.568
Doesn't change the fact
that they're forcing him

19:28.601 --> 19:29.902
to go through with
the attack anyway.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.704
Yeah, well,
it's not just any attack.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.773
They're targeting Mayor Taylor.

19:33.806 --> 19:34.774
Wait a second.

19:34.807 --> 19:35.575
What?

19:35.608 --> 19:37.277
Noora said Sharif
kept yelling that

19:37.310 --> 19:38.911
to her as they took him.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.980
Does Wade know?
Yeah.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.449
She's counting on us
to save the mayor

19:42.482 --> 19:44.584
and Sharif now.
The only way
to do that

19:44.617 --> 19:45.952
is to stop the attack
before it happens,

19:45.985 --> 19:47.454
and we can't find
Sharif's recruiter or...

19:47.487 --> 19:48.855
Then we'd better figure it out.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.257
According to Noora,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.292
she contacted her son
on a messaging app.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.960
Terrorists had
to hack into it

19:53.993 --> 19:55.962
to know that Sharif
was gonna be here.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.597
I'll try to get
Patton to trace it.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.965
I'll pull surveillance.
There's plenty of cameras

19:58.998 --> 20:00.833
around the square,
help us find the van.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.969
And then get Sebastian
out here, all right?

20:03.002 --> 20:04.837
He needs to turn this place
upside down.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.006
Tire tracks, trace evidence.
We need something.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.441
Okay, but where are you going?

20:09.476 --> 20:11.878
Someone needs to warn the mayor.

20:22.655 --> 20:26.593
All right, Dwayne, I canceled
on a veterans group,

20:26.626 --> 20:28.661
which no doubt my opponent's
gonna want to hammer me on,

20:28.695 --> 20:30.930
so what was so important you
couldn't tell me over the phone?

20:30.963 --> 20:32.965
Someone's trying
to kill you, Zahra.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.033
TAYLOR:
What?

20:34.066 --> 20:38.471
The first black female mayor
this town's ever had?

20:38.505 --> 20:39.472
Somebody who wants
to change its corrupt ways?

20:39.506 --> 20:41.708
Hell, there's probably
a long list of people

20:41.741 --> 20:43.876
who want to kill me just
for running my mouth.
Not people. Not people.

20:43.910 --> 20:44.877
Zahra.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.613
ISIS.

20:46.646 --> 20:49.349
ISIS?

20:49.382 --> 20:50.350
Are you sure about this?

20:50.383 --> 20:51.618
What I'm sure about

20:51.651 --> 20:54.053
is a local refugee
is being forced into it.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.423
He was taken,
he warned his mother

20:56.456 --> 20:57.524
that you were the target.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.359
That doesn't make sense.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.728
A terrorist attack's supposed
to have some sort of ideology

21:01.761 --> 21:02.795
behind it.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.597
Why would killing me...?
New Orleans

21:04.631 --> 21:06.032
is a high-profile target.
You know that.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.900
And for all the reasons
you just said,

21:07.934 --> 21:10.837
you are the high-profile center
of it all.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.073
So, what do you want me to do?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.975
We don't have a choice.
You have to stop campaigning.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.477
What?! No way.
Zahra,

21:17.510 --> 21:19.312
it's too dangerous.
I said no, damn it.

21:19.346 --> 21:22.949
If I stop now, I'll let down
everyone who's fought so hard

21:22.982 --> 21:24.451
to make this city better,

21:24.484 --> 21:25.652
to change it for the better.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.455
I've come too far. This city's
come too far to back down now.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.323
My team's working
around the clock.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.091
We're doing all we can
to stop the attack,

21:32.124 --> 21:34.060
but the only way

21:34.093 --> 21:36.929
to really protect you...
The election's one
day away. One day.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.798
I have a speech
in Jackson Square

21:38.831 --> 21:39.632
in an hour, strategy session

21:39.666 --> 21:41.934
with my staff, then dinner
You can't...

21:41.968 --> 21:42.969
with donors, phone calls,

21:43.002 --> 21:44.771
knocking on doors, a rally

21:44.804 --> 21:46.439
in Laketown in the morning.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.975
Dwayne Pride, I'll be dammed
if I'm gonna let anyone

21:49.008 --> 21:51.711
try and scare me off.
You understand?

21:54.547 --> 21:57.083
I say something funny or...?
No.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.485
No, you just reminded me

21:58.518 --> 22:00.653
why I need to do
everything I can

22:00.687 --> 22:02.455
to help get you elected.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.361
All right, now, thank you.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.363
And don't forget to vote.
All right.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.498
I'll be right there.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.533
I'll be waiting.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.536
Pride, where's she headed?

22:16.569 --> 22:17.670
Where are you going?

22:17.704 --> 22:19.872
I'm going to protect her.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.408
And I'm counting on you all

22:21.441 --> 22:23.009
to figure out
how to stop the attack.
Whoa.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.544
Hold up.
You're putting yourself

22:24.577 --> 22:26.045
in the line of fire, too?

22:26.078 --> 22:27.747
I believe in what
she's fighting for,

22:27.780 --> 22:29.081
so I'm fighting with her.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.117
Besides, I know who's
after her, which means

22:31.150 --> 22:33.453
being by Zahra's side
might be the only way

22:33.486 --> 22:35.054
to save her if you can't.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.857
You find out anything
about Sharif or the van?

22:37.890 --> 22:38.891
Surveillance came back empty,

22:38.925 --> 22:41.093
but we're still waiting
on Sebastian's forensics.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.595
Yeah, Patton's
still trying to trace

22:42.629 --> 22:44.564
who hacked into
Noora's message app.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.066
Afraid I don't have an ID
on that yet, but I do have one

22:47.099 --> 22:49.101
on the guy who was sucking
on that water pipe.

22:49.135 --> 22:52.171
Sharif's recruiter?
Yeah, but nothing I found

22:52.204 --> 22:54.474
indicated he's with ISIS,
though. Check it out.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.142
Yossuf Abbas,

22:56.175 --> 22:58.177
born in Amman, but
he's a U.S. citizen

22:58.210 --> 23:01.147
who's not even on
the FBI's terrorist watch list.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.182
Still doesn't mean
he's not ISIS.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.851
I mean,
we don't know every embed.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.153
Yeah, but we do know
they've got Sharif

23:07.186 --> 23:09.188
and they're targeting
Mayor Taylor.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.057
I'll check her itinerary,

23:11.090 --> 23:13.560
see if I can't narrow down
likely vulnerabilities.

23:13.593 --> 23:17.029
You stay on Sharif,
Abbas and the van.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.631
Keep me posted.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.700
Okay. Not exactly the way

23:20.733 --> 23:22.502
I planned on celebrating
my Mardi Gras,

23:22.535 --> 23:24.170
worrying about saving
Pride's life, too.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.539
Yeah, we need more, fast.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.007
All right, call Sebastian.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.842
See if he found anything

23:29.876 --> 23:31.978
from when they grabbed Sharif.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.145
Sebastian.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.847
Aah, God!
Give us something good.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.016
All right. Well, two things.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.051
One is I'm turning off
auto answer

23:39.085 --> 23:41.854
because that just
scared the hell out of me.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.890
And two,

23:43.923 --> 23:45.992
I might have actually
found something.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.259
You find the van?

23:47.293 --> 23:50.062
No, but I might have a lead on
where it was before the attack.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.832
Mineral deposits left behind
by the skid marks

23:52.865 --> 23:55.001
showed trace evidence
of nitrogen,

23:55.034 --> 23:57.737
phosphorus, magnesium,
ammonium nitrate...

23:57.770 --> 23:59.506
Fertilizer?

23:59.539 --> 24:02.208
Yeah, and I'll take bomb-making
materials for a thousand, Alex,

24:02.241 --> 24:04.777
because I found hydrocarbons
mixed in with it, too.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.613
So they're making
a fertilizer bomb.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.214
Has all the earmarks
of one, yeah.

24:08.247 --> 24:11.250
And if so, they'll
have to place it close

24:11.283 --> 24:12.752
to the mayor before
they ignite it.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.253
Yeah, but there's no way
they could drive in

24:14.286 --> 24:15.922
with a car or truck,

24:15.955 --> 24:17.990
not with all the street closures
and security.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.527
Unless the bomb
is already in position.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.163
Sounds like a pretty
specific group of materials.

24:24.196 --> 24:27.099
You think you can trace where
the fertilizer came from?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.868
Will do.

24:28.901 --> 24:32.104
Find the fertilizer,
find the terrorists?
Got to hope.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.673
It's our only chance
of stopping the attack

24:33.706 --> 24:35.074
before it's too late.

24:46.719 --> 24:50.256
LASALLE: Last fertilizer plant.
This has got to be it.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.791
GREGORIO: If not,
we're back to square one.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.259
LASALLE: We don't have time
for square one.

24:53.292 --> 24:56.162
It's Election Day.
We've got a mayor to save.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.801
Think we found the van.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.571
Yeah, obviously trying
to cover their tracks,

25:04.604 --> 25:06.205
which means the attack's
still in motion.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.807
No sign of Sharif.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.208
Well, the van's still smoking.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.710
They got to be close.

25:19.619 --> 25:20.887
Oh, my God. That's Sharif.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.322
Yeah, in a boat loaded
full of explosives.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.891
Any idea where
this canal leads to?

25:24.924 --> 25:26.225
Yeah, and it ain't good.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.267
It took us 300 years,

25:35.301 --> 25:36.936
but we're almost there,
aren't we?

25:36.969 --> 25:38.771
Aren't we?

25:38.805 --> 25:40.740
And who are we?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.108
We're French,

25:42.141 --> 25:44.276
Spanish, American,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.178
African, Indian,

25:46.212 --> 25:47.847
and we're proud of that.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.016
And we can no longer

25:50.049 --> 25:51.317
allow the privileged few,

25:51.350 --> 25:53.319
'cause I don't see them
out here today.

25:53.352 --> 25:55.221
I don't see them.
Find something, Chris?

25:55.254 --> 25:57.323
Yeah. Are you at the rally?
Yeah, we're right
in the middle of it.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.257
We're proud of that New Or...

25:58.290 --> 26:00.359
Why?
Because Sharif
is headed your way

26:00.392 --> 26:03.062
in a boat loaded full
of explosives, ready to blow

26:03.095 --> 26:04.864
everything up to kingdom come.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.165
Sharif

26:06.198 --> 26:07.333
Yeah.
Gregorio saw him, too, King.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.868
You want me
to call the Coast Guard?

26:08.901 --> 26:12.304
To corrupt who we
really are anymore...

26:12.338 --> 26:14.741
No, it's too late. Get
everybody out of here.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.676
Everyone, we need
to leave the park right now.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.277
Safely but quickly. Please.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.612
Get the mayor
off the stage right now.

26:19.646 --> 26:20.780
Get her to safety.

26:20.813 --> 26:21.948
Hurry. Loretta, go with her.

26:21.981 --> 26:22.949
Go, go, go!

26:27.920 --> 26:29.155
What the hell is he doing?

26:32.659 --> 26:35.094
All right, listen to me.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.295
Gonna fire a warning shot.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.297
Do not hit the boat.
It is rigged to blow.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.604
Dwayne!

26:46.438 --> 26:48.775
Go, Loretta. You got to go now.

26:48.808 --> 26:49.842
Everybody, go!

26:51.243 --> 26:52.344
Fire at the boat.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.312
Fire!

27:24.076 --> 27:25.177
MAN:
Our city's safety

27:25.211 --> 27:27.046
should be
of paramount importance,

27:27.079 --> 27:28.314
but not to Mayor Taylor,

27:28.347 --> 27:31.017
whose idealistic,
open door policies

27:31.050 --> 27:32.785
and Kumbaya mentality

27:32.819 --> 27:34.320
led to this near tragedy.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.022
COOK:
Uh, I highly doubt

27:36.055 --> 27:37.256
that voters agree with Taylor

27:37.289 --> 27:39.692
that welcoming
refugees and criminals

27:39.726 --> 27:41.828
into our city
is the kind of change we want...

27:41.861 --> 27:43.395
It's not fair that
they're blaming Mayor Taylor

27:43.429 --> 27:45.031
for everything that happened.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.699
Especially since Mayor
Taylor almost died.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.000
That's cold.
Yeah.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.169
That's Butler.
He'll do or say anything

27:50.202 --> 27:52.271
to get elected.
Mayor Hamilton, the sequel.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.305
Just what we don't need.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.807
Maybe this election needs

27:54.841 --> 27:56.442
a little Russian-style
hacker meddling.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.979
Just joking. Sort of.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.848
Yeah, well, I'm not
in the mood to joke.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.150
Still don't understand
why Sharif did this.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.185
I thought
he was being forced into it.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.054
Well, that doesn't mean
he wasn't still.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.422
I mean, who knows what kind
of leverage they had on him.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.158
Yeah, but why risk
even warning us?

28:12.191 --> 28:13.893
He knew we'd try to stop him.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.294
Just doesn't make any sense.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.328
No, it doesn't.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.398
Follow me.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.201
I kept replaying what happened
over and over.

28:22.234 --> 28:25.237
It didn't add up,
just like you said.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.306
Sharif had to know
that we'd try to stop him,

28:27.339 --> 28:29.308
which means the terrorists
had to know, too.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.510
It's all too neat.
I had a hunch.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.379
Let's see if I'm right.

28:33.412 --> 28:34.914
What'd you find out, Loretta?

28:34.947 --> 28:37.083
I found the best news
of all, Dwayne.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.251
It wasn't Sharif
driving the boat.

28:39.285 --> 28:40.419
Wow.
LASALLE:
But wait a second.

28:40.452 --> 28:41.754
I thought y'all saw him.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.422
We saw a red hoodie.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.291
That's what they
wanted us to see.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.459
Knew we'd blow the boat
before we could get a clear look

28:47.493 --> 28:49.395
at who he really was.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.831
Well, tissue samples show
that the real driver of the boat

28:51.864 --> 28:54.300
was a man named Zaid Farhi
from Houston.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.068
Any affiliation to ISIS?

28:56.102 --> 28:58.237
SEBASTIAN: A couple garden
variety felonies and assaults.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.405
No obvious links.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.440
Wait, hold on. Slow down.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.310
So, this Farhi guy was set up
to look like Sharif?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.846
Why? I mean, if he wasn't ISIS,

29:06.879 --> 29:09.281
why would he sacrifice his life?

29:09.315 --> 29:11.918
Tox screen indicated
that he was drugged,

29:11.951 --> 29:14.286
uh, most likely unconscious
at the time.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.022
SEBASTIAN: Yeah,
and most likely with his hands

29:16.055 --> 29:17.356
tied to the wheel.

29:17.389 --> 29:18.457
So, I found this floating

29:18.490 --> 29:19.992
near the debris field.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.393
I-I can't confirm it yet,
but I'm...

29:21.427 --> 29:23.262
I mean, I'm guessing
that this thing's gonna show

29:23.295 --> 29:24.496
that the boat
was controlled remotely.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.866
All right,
so this bad guy named Farhi

29:26.899 --> 29:30.402
was knocked out and then tied
to a boat full of explosives.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.805
And made to look
like it's Sharif.
To send him

29:32.839 --> 29:35.441
towards Mayor Taylor, knowing
that we would try to stop him.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.144
Yeah, well, the terrorists
knew that we were onto them.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.012
Needed to find a way
to make us think

29:40.046 --> 29:41.413
that we averted the attack.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.282
Yeah, hoping we would
let down our guard,

29:43.315 --> 29:44.483
thinking the threat was over.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.118
And that Sharif was dead.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.353
But he's not dead, Dwayne.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.988
He's still alive.
But why?

29:49.021 --> 29:50.356
What do they still need him for?

29:50.389 --> 29:52.158
The terrorists
couldn't possibly expect

29:52.191 --> 29:53.425
to use him
to make another attempt

29:53.459 --> 29:55.061
against Mayor Taylor.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.462
That makes even less sense.

29:56.495 --> 29:58.297
Then we make it make sense.

29:58.330 --> 30:02.034
Loretta, I need you to explain
all of this to the mayor

30:02.068 --> 30:03.335
and get her to lay low.

30:03.369 --> 30:06.172
On Election Day?

30:06.205 --> 30:07.874
I'll try.

30:07.907 --> 30:10.142
But I'll call Noora first,

30:10.176 --> 30:11.410
let her know Sharif's okay.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.512
No, no, not-not just yet.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.381
We can't risk letting
the terrorists find out

30:15.414 --> 30:16.448
that we know.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.517
Otherwise, we might not be able

30:18.550 --> 30:20.352
to save him
from whatever they got planned.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.254
You want me to keep
trying to break this down,

30:22.288 --> 30:25.191
see if it leads anywhere?
Yeah, go.

30:25.224 --> 30:28.360
You backtrack
how they intercepted the message

30:28.394 --> 30:30.229
Sharif's mom left for him yet?

30:30.262 --> 30:32.631
I narrowed the IP address down
to a few locations,

30:32.664 --> 30:34.200
but nothing concrete.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.435
I need your best guess here,
Patton.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.537
There's too much at stake,
and we're running out of time.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.472
We got to find those terrorists.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.075
I'm on it.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.411
ARTHUR:
They tried to kill you, Zahra.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.446
That doesn't make them all bad.

30:47.479 --> 30:50.482
I will not denounce
an entire community of refugees

30:50.516 --> 30:51.450
because of the actions of one.

30:51.483 --> 30:52.952
It's profiling,

30:52.985 --> 30:54.286
and I won't stand for it.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.155
Even if it costs you
the election?

30:56.188 --> 30:58.224
Even if it costs me
the election.

31:02.294 --> 31:05.464
I'd like the room, please.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.305
Pride send you

31:13.339 --> 31:15.274
to try and talk some sense
into me, too?

31:15.307 --> 31:17.343
As a matter
of fact, yes.

31:17.376 --> 31:20.412
Sharif was not the one who
tried to kill you this morning.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.314
It was made to
look like him.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.650
Why

31:24.683 --> 31:27.486
Dwayne doesn't know yet,
but they were obviously

31:27.519 --> 31:30.689
using Sharif
as some kind of scapegoat.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.459
Dwayne'll figure it out.
In the meantime...

31:33.492 --> 31:35.394
I'm not standing down, Loretta,
so don't even try.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.296
Zahra...
You know me better
than anyone.

31:37.329 --> 31:40.032
You know I don't ever
walk away from a fight.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.370
As a matter of fact...

31:44.403 --> 31:45.938
Where are you going?

31:45.972 --> 31:47.940
I'm going
to do exactly the opposite

31:47.974 --> 31:49.976
of what everybody wants me
to do.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.944
I'm going to go stand
with the refugees

31:51.978 --> 31:53.445
and let them know
I support them,

31:53.479 --> 31:55.114
and let whoever's after me know

31:55.147 --> 31:57.316
I will not be intimidated.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.221
Oh, boy. Geez.

32:07.459 --> 32:10.296
PRIDE: If Patton's right
and the terrorists are here,

32:10.329 --> 32:12.198
they'll have Sharif, too.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.652
Federal agents!
Drop your weapons!

32:37.623 --> 32:39.025
It's not worth it, Abbas!

32:39.058 --> 32:41.027
Get your hands up. Now. Slow!

32:41.060 --> 32:42.661
On your knees.

32:48.367 --> 32:51.437
I got him, King.
You all right, Sharif?
Hey, you okay?

32:51.470 --> 32:53.505
My mother...
What about your mother?

32:53.539 --> 32:56.508
Pride, not to profile,
but these guys seem more

32:56.542 --> 32:59.545
like mercenaries
than terrorists.
Could be sympathizers.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.280
Except he doesn't seem to have
any radical affiliations.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.115
Neither did the guy on the boat.

33:03.149 --> 33:06.285
Someone's trying to make it
look like it's terrorists.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.555
Please. They have my mother.
You have to stop them!

33:09.588 --> 33:11.657
WADE:
Zahra, I know how strongly

33:11.690 --> 33:13.359
you feel, but you
are too exposed.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.361
We've had this conversation,
Loretta.

33:15.394 --> 33:17.096
I'm here because
it's the right thing to do.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.565
Now, which one is
Sharif's mother?

33:20.599 --> 33:22.568
Loretta, which one
is Sharif's mother?

33:22.601 --> 33:25.704
Second to last table
on the right.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.711
Noora?

33:32.744 --> 33:34.746
May I call you Noora?

33:36.148 --> 33:38.684
What are you doing here?

33:38.717 --> 33:40.752
I'm Zahra,

33:40.786 --> 33:42.488
and I wanted

33:42.521 --> 33:44.223
to come here and
tell you personally

33:44.256 --> 33:45.824
that I'm on your side.

33:45.857 --> 33:50.596
I'm not going to let anybody
turn your son into a scapegoat.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.465
I-I do not understand.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.834
Do you want to tell
her, or shall I?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.636
Dwayne said specifically
not to tell...

33:57.669 --> 34:00.806
Your son is alive, Noora.
Alive, and we're doing

34:00.839 --> 34:03.809
everything we can to find him
and to stop these people who...

34:03.842 --> 34:05.844
No, you can't.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.081
This is the only way
to save Sharif.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.185
Noora, what are
you talking about?

34:17.356 --> 34:19.725
I have no choice.

34:19.758 --> 34:21.660
Forgive me.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.625
How did you know the mayor
would go to Sharif's mother?

34:53.659 --> 34:55.661
Huh? Answer me!
ABBAS:
Those who know her say

34:55.694 --> 34:57.429
she's predictable.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.731
They were right,
and you're too late.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.634
We have to find a way
to let her know I'm safe!

35:02.668 --> 35:04.370
TAYLOR:
Let's

35:04.403 --> 35:06.372
try...

35:06.405 --> 35:08.640
and talk about this.
Noora,

35:08.674 --> 35:14.313
she didn't come here
to hurt you or Sharif.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.348
She came here to help.

35:16.382 --> 35:19.185
This is the only way
to help Sharif.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.220
This is the only way
they let him live.
Noora...

35:21.253 --> 35:23.455
I am his mother.
I have to protect him.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.591
This won't save your son.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.493
If they don't
kill him,

35:27.526 --> 35:29.228
they'll return him
to the country

35:29.261 --> 35:31.197
you sacrificed so much

35:31.230 --> 35:32.631
to rescue him from.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.866
Noora, please.
I understand this--

35:34.900 --> 35:37.469
the love of a mother--

35:37.503 --> 35:41.640
but you can't do it like this.

35:41.673 --> 35:45.377
Please, I have lost so much.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.613
:
I cannot lose Sharif, too.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.284
Uh, please, please.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.720
Just-just let me
answer the phone, I beg of you.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.622
It-it... it could

35:56.655 --> 35:59.458
be about Sharif.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.764
NOPD's on their way.

36:05.797 --> 36:08.567
Come on, Loretta.
Pick up, damn it!

36:13.739 --> 36:15.941
Dwayne.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.309
Yes, Loretta, we've got Sharif.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.477
Put Noora on the line.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.848
It's Sharif.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.951
Hello. Mama?

36:25.984 --> 36:27.386
Habibi.

36:53.612 --> 36:54.613
I love you.

37:10.796 --> 37:13.599
NEWSWOMAN:
We feel quite confident here
to project Zahra Taylor

37:13.632 --> 37:14.666
as the winner of this election.

37:14.700 --> 37:15.901
Ron.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.036
Quite an upset
considering the...

37:18.069 --> 37:19.805
Dwayne.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.675
Didn't turn out the way
you'd planned, did it?

37:23.709 --> 37:25.844
Did everything you could
to keep it that way?

37:25.877 --> 37:27.579
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:30.949 --> 37:33.719
Sure, you do.

37:33.752 --> 37:37.789
Tried to make the refugees look
like terrorists, scapegoats.

37:37.823 --> 37:41.493
Tried to use them
to kill Mayor Taylor.

37:41.527 --> 37:44.563
Mayor Taylor.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.798
All so you could stay
in control of the city.

37:46.832 --> 37:49.468
Again...

37:49.501 --> 37:51.703
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.739
That's all right.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.342
You can explain it
to the U.S. Attorney,

37:56.375 --> 37:58.310
'cause you're under arrest,
Mr. Cook.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.646
GREGORIO:
Conspiracy to
commit murder. Oh.

38:00.679 --> 38:04.683
And add on election fraud
and domestic terrorism charges.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.318
Abbas turned State's evidence,

38:06.352 --> 38:09.321
threw you under
the bus. We know

38:09.355 --> 38:11.022
you hired him to set up Sharif.
GREGORIO:
We really

38:11.056 --> 38:13.058
messed you up when we got
on this case, didn't we?

38:13.091 --> 38:14.726
When you couldn't get Sharif
to kill the mayor,

38:14.760 --> 38:17.829
you used him to force his mama
to do it instead.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.731
Yeah, you figured the
mayor would go to her

38:19.765 --> 38:20.999
out of the goodness
of her heart.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.569
Knew she would stand
by the refugees.

38:23.602 --> 38:24.903
And even if she didn't,

38:24.936 --> 38:26.838
a suicide bomber blowing herself
up at an election

38:26.872 --> 38:28.974
would sway voters.
PRIDE:
Tried to make it look like

38:29.007 --> 38:30.676
terrorism when it was all

38:30.709 --> 38:33.412
just about you
getting your candidate elected.

38:33.445 --> 38:36.682
If you think you can bring me
down like you did Hamilton,

38:36.715 --> 38:39.651
you got another thing coming.

38:39.685 --> 38:42.053
This doesn't change anything.

38:42.087 --> 38:46.124
It changes who's in control
of this city... finally,

38:46.157 --> 38:48.727
and it sure as hell isn't you.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.435
Get him out of here.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.103
Come on.

39:07.679 --> 39:12.618
NEWSMAN:
Acting Mayor Zahra Taylor is now
officially Mayor Taylor,

39:12.651 --> 39:15.921
the first African-American woman
to lead this city.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.022
Quite an achievement.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.944
All right, can't very well
celebrate the tricentennial

39:38.977 --> 39:40.912
Mardi Gras without
a king cake, huh?

39:40.946 --> 39:42.180
PATTON:
All right.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.815
Now you're
talking, baby!

39:43.849 --> 39:44.983
Man, that's a
good-looking cake.

39:45.016 --> 39:46.585
Where'd you get
it, Randazzo's?

39:46.618 --> 39:47.886
No. Noora.
Mm-hmm.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.788
She and Sharif wanted
to show their gratitude.

39:49.821 --> 39:52.157
Combined a little
of the hometown bakery

39:52.190 --> 39:54.993
with one of the oldest
traditions in their new town.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.695
Isn't that fantastic?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.897
Might have a little more
basbousa in it than nutmeg,

39:58.930 --> 40:00.131
but it sure looks good.

40:00.165 --> 40:01.833
That's what I love
about this town, man.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.535
Everyone adds their own flavor,
you know?

40:03.569 --> 40:05.971
Hey, it's too bad Percy's
not gonna get to enjoy it.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.507
Keep fishing, Lasalle.
Keep fishing.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.175
Hey, five bucks says
she's with a new flame.

40:10.208 --> 40:11.943
Not that I'm gambling.
I'm not gambling.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.879
It's totally gambling.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.013
To a new dawn!

40:15.046 --> 40:16.682
To a new dawn!

40:16.715 --> 40:17.916
New dawn!
All right.
