01:22.303 --> 01:25.640
Hodges. What d'you think
about those hotshot jitterbugs?

01:26.098 --> 01:28.893
- What about 'em?
- You never pulled that shit, did you?

01:29.018 --> 01:31.062
No way.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.440
- Bullshit, huh?
- Yeah.

01:35.191 --> 01:40.071
I don't understand Melindez, I really don't.
John Wayne's Rexall Rangers... pussies.

01:40.196 --> 01:42.490
I got one year left.

01:42.615 --> 01:45.076
Gimme a towel. And after that...

01:46.619 --> 01:48.663
After that...

01:50.164 --> 01:52.208
Excuse me.

01:58.381 --> 02:00.424
I'm gonna go for another ten.

02:01.509 --> 02:03.553
Who are you?

02:06.931 --> 02:09.058
Rocky VI.

02:11.894 --> 02:14.105
What'd you say you did for a living?

02:15.189 --> 02:17.984
I'm a guardian of masculinity, man.

02:18.109 --> 02:21.112
- Somebody smells good!
- Where does that put you?

02:21.237 --> 02:24.490
- Where the fuck is my gun?
- Fuck.

02:24.615 --> 02:27.660
We want a uniformed presence...

02:27.785 --> 02:29.829
out in the street.

02:29.954 --> 02:32.290
They're flying their colours...

02:32.415 --> 02:34.292
we're flying ours.

02:34.417 --> 02:37.295
I want them to know
who they're dealing with.

02:38.004 --> 02:41.841
They got uzis. They got shotguns.

02:41.966 --> 02:47.680
They got explosives. They got access
to any weapon they want within 24 hours.

02:47.805 --> 02:50.725
We got over 50,000
gangbangers out there.

02:50.850 --> 02:53.144
We're bleeding from open wounds.

02:53.311 --> 02:56.105
We're just jamming you 24 in
to stop the flow.

02:56.230 --> 02:58.691
We sound like a bunch of Tampax.

03:00.693 --> 03:02.904
What?

03:05.698 --> 03:08.701
You wanna tell me what you were saying?

03:10.244 --> 03:12.204
Uh...

03:12.330 --> 03:15.207
I said we sound like
a bunch of Tampax, sir.

03:18.377 --> 03:20.004
Kid's cute.

03:20.338 --> 03:22.715
Tampax goes someplace good.

03:26.719 --> 03:29.680
- Give this guy to Hodges.
- What? What?

03:31.057 --> 03:33.184
Beat it.

03:54.330 --> 03:56.791
<i>A wise man</i>

03:57.041 --> 03:59.335
<i>Was tellin' stories to me</i>

03:59.460 --> 04:04.507
<i>About the places he had been to
and the things that he had seen</i>

04:06.342 --> 04:08.970
<i>A quiet voice</i>

04:09.095 --> 04:11.556
<i>Was singin' something to me</i>

04:11.722 --> 04:16.185
<i>An age-old song 'bout the home
of the brave in this land here of the free</i>

04:16.310 --> 04:19.564
<i>One time one night in America</i>

04:21.065 --> 04:24.986
<i>A lady dressed in white
with the man she loved</i>

04:26.320 --> 04:30.324
<i>Was standing along the side
of a pick-up truck</i>

04:31.576 --> 04:34.036
<i>A shot rang out in the night</i>

04:34.161 --> 04:36.622
<i>Just when everything seemed right</i>

04:36.747 --> 04:40.501
<i>Another headline written
down in America</i>

04:42.295 --> 04:46.048
<i>The guy that lived next door in 305</i>

04:47.258 --> 04:51.888
<i>Took the kids to the park
and disappeared 'bout half past nine</i>

04:52.889 --> 04:58.102
<i>Who will ever know
how much she loved them so?</i>

04:58.227 --> 05:01.397
<i>That dark night alone in America</i>

05:03.608 --> 05:05.651
<i>A quiet voice</i>

05:06.152 --> 05:09.030
<i>Was singin' somethin' to me</i>

05:09.155 --> 05:13.284
<i>An age-old song 'bout the home
of the brave in this land here of the free</i>

05:13.409 --> 05:16.662
<i>One time one night in America</i>

05:21.042 --> 05:24.712
<i>Four small boys
playing ball in the parking lot</i>

05:26.255 --> 05:30.092
<i>A preacher, a teacher
and the other became a cop</i>

05:31.260 --> 05:33.721
<i>A car skidded into the rain</i>

05:33.888 --> 05:36.724
<i>Making the last little one a saint</i>

05:36.849 --> 05:40.519
<i>One more light goes out in America</i>

05:42.230 --> 05:46.776
<i>A young girl tosses a coin
in a wishing well</i>

05:47.568 --> 05:51.697
<i>She hopes for a heaven,
but for her there's just this hell</i>

05:52.531 --> 05:55.076
<i>She gave away her life</i>

05:55.326 --> 05:58.204
<i>To become somebody's wife</i>

05:58.329 --> 06:02.083
<i>Another wish unanswered in America</i>

06:03.584 --> 06:06.128
<i>People havin' so much faith</i>

06:06.295 --> 06:09.882
<i>Die too soon
while all the rest come late</i>

06:11.551 --> 06:15.054
<i>We write a song that no one sings
on a cold black stone</i>

06:15.179 --> 06:19.475
<i>Where a lasting peace
will finally bring...</i>

06:42.081 --> 06:45.209
<i>Say, Rocket's gonna pop it
And no one's gonna stop it</i>

06:45.334 --> 06:48.004
<i>Look what I got
to rock your knots with...</i>

06:48.129 --> 06:50.506
- Just light the damn sherm.
- Yes, yes.

06:50.673 --> 06:52.884
- Light it up, dude.
- Yes, yes, yo.

07:00.224 --> 07:03.561
- Sherm up the driver, cuz.
- Eat it up.

07:03.686 --> 07:07.231
<i>We like to get high
So a nigger kid dies</i>

07:07.356 --> 07:10.192
<i>Checkin' out slobs
That is our job</i>

07:10.318 --> 07:14.155
<i>And if you think we're the Crips
Well, you hit it on the nob</i>

07:14.322 --> 07:17.742
<i>G-ridin' in the van
With my main man</i>

07:17.909 --> 07:21.412
<i>Shotgun jam
Turnin' niggers into Spam</i>

07:23.331 --> 07:26.375
<i>Rocket don't smoke
And Rocket don't joke</i>

07:26.500 --> 07:29.537
<i>Yo! Rocket, put the cap on the nigger</i>

07:34.550 --> 07:37.428
- Hey, man, shut the fuck up.
- Better?

07:37.553 --> 07:40.223
- Chill out, motherfucker.
- Yo, Rocket.

07:49.774 --> 07:52.235
Man, I'm high as a motherfucker.

07:56.030 --> 07:58.741
Yo, Rocket, we're comin' in.

08:10.419 --> 08:12.296
Hey, Blood!

08:13.548 --> 08:15.258
Oh, God! No!

08:15.383 --> 08:17.385
No! No!

08:17.510 --> 08:19.262
No! No!

08:19.387 --> 08:22.640
Oh, God! No! No! No!

08:22.765 --> 08:25.434
He can't die! He can't die!

08:26.435 --> 08:29.814
No! He can't die!

08:29.939 --> 08:34.025
No! Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy!

08:37.071 --> 08:39.532
No!

08:39.657 --> 08:44.328
- What'd you find out?
- OK, the victim's name is Robert Craig.

08:44.453 --> 08:46.914
A little warlock, house of Blood set.

08:47.081 --> 08:51.377
Apparently, at least two blacks
drive by in a van, say "Hey, Blood." Boom.

08:51.502 --> 08:53.546
Shit.

08:56.299 --> 08:58.759
She saw it.

09:05.349 --> 09:07.393
Excuse me.

09:09.020 --> 09:12.231
- I ain't seen nothin'.
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.

09:12.815 --> 09:15.526
- Nothin'!
- Ma'am, if you saw this, you can't...

09:15.651 --> 09:19.405
Who can't? Just get on out of my face.

09:19.530 --> 09:22.575
Are you gonna just close your eyes
every time this happens?

09:22.700 --> 09:27.455
- There's a kid laying here dead, ma'am!
- Let's go, let's go. She has to live here.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.790
No, please!

09:35.671 --> 09:37.548
No!

09:38.925 --> 09:41.385
He can't die! He can't die!

09:45.223 --> 09:47.475
D'you need anything?

09:47.975 --> 09:51.729
Jeez, I don't know, Hodges.
Maybe some of your valuable expertise.

09:52.563 --> 09:58.361
I doubt it. You guys are doin' such a fine
job, that's why they call us out at 2am.

09:58.903 --> 10:03.866
Hey, why don't you flyin' CRASH guys
go take a flyin' fuck?

10:07.411 --> 10:09.455
Hey, fuck you.

10:10.539 --> 10:13.292
- Fuck you.
- Let's get in the car.

10:13.417 --> 10:15.461
There's too many bodies around here.

10:15.586 --> 10:18.047
No! No! No!

10:20.258 --> 10:22.009
He can't die! No!

10:22.134 --> 10:25.763
Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy!

10:25.888 --> 10:27.723
No!

10:29.642 --> 10:32.019
The kid was a Blood. Dealing too.

10:32.186 --> 10:36.566
Whether it was drugs or gang related, I
don't know. For now, let's hook and book.

10:36.691 --> 10:39.527
Be inventive. Find some probable cause.

10:39.652 --> 10:42.738
Get both gangs off the street,
at least for a night or two.

10:42.863 --> 10:45.575
Let 'em calm down. See if they'll talk.

10:46.534 --> 10:49.954
What I need is a shot of Demerol
and some clean sheets.

10:51.414 --> 10:54.083
Whoa, whoa. Any further questions?

10:54.208 --> 10:56.752
- No, sir.
- All right. Let's rock 'n' roll.

11:04.468 --> 11:08.222
- Stand up. Keep your fuckin' mouth shut.
- Why the fuck you holdin' on us?

11:08.389 --> 11:10.266
- Wait, wait.
- Shut up!

11:10.391 --> 11:12.643
Don't get excited, man. Wait!

11:13.185 --> 11:17.481
Yo, man, we ain't did nothin'!

11:17.607 --> 11:20.818
Man, they rode on us.
The punk-ass motherfuckers!

11:22.570 --> 11:23.738
Keep movin', Rocket.

11:23.905 --> 11:27.283
<i>I am a nightmare walkin'
Psychopath talkin'</i>

11:27.408 --> 11:29.368
<i>King of my jungle
Just a gangster stalkin'</i>

11:29.493 --> 11:32.121
<i>Livin' life like a firecracker
Quick is my fuse</i>

11:32.246 --> 11:34.457
<i>Vendettas of death
Back the colors I choose</i>

11:34.582 --> 11:37.043
<i>Red or blue, Cuz or Blood
It just don't matter</i>

11:37.168 --> 11:39.795
<i>Sucker, dive for your life
When my shotgun scatters</i>

11:39.921 --> 11:42.381
<i>Colors
The gangs of LA will never die</i>

11:43.507 --> 11:45.051
<i>Just multiply
Colors</i>

11:45.176 --> 11:47.637
<i>Colors, colors, colors</i>

11:47.762 --> 11:50.139
<i>Colors, colors, colors</i>

11:50.306 --> 11:52.683
<i>Colors, colors, colors</i>

11:52.850 --> 11:55.394
<i>Colors, colors, colors</i>

11:55.561 --> 11:57.855
<i>Colors, colors, colors</i>

11:58.105 --> 12:00.483
<i>Colors, colors, colors</i>

12:00.608 --> 12:03.069
<i>Colors, colors, colors</i>

12:03.194 --> 12:05.196
<i>Colors, colors</i>

12:05.321 --> 12:07.865
<i>You don't know me, fool</i>

12:07.990 --> 12:10.368
<i>You disown me, cool</i>

12:10.493 --> 12:13.120
<i>I don't need your assistance
Social persistence</i>

12:13.246 --> 12:16.123
<i>Any problem I got
I just put my fist in</i>

12:16.249 --> 12:18.167
<i>My life is violent
But violent is life</i>

12:18.459 --> 12:20.920
<i>Peace is a dream
Reality is a knife</i>

12:21.045 --> 12:23.256
<i>My color's my honor
My color's my all</i>

12:23.381 --> 12:25.758
<i>With my colors upon me
One soldier stands tall</i>

12:25.925 --> 12:28.386
<i>Tell me, what have you left me?
What have I got?</i>

12:28.553 --> 12:31.430
<i>Last night in cold blood
My young brother got shot</i>

12:35.643 --> 12:39.480
And there they are. The Ville.
Crips. Crip de Ville.

12:39.689 --> 12:43.901
Stone fuckin' killers. They'll walk in your
house, blow you away, sit down to eat...

12:44.026 --> 12:46.237
Then leave.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.994
That's right.
You get them off the street.

12:53.661 --> 12:56.998
- Lady, we're trying.
- You need more help!

12:58.249 --> 13:02.587
- So, what's up, Rocky-o?
- Yo, yo, yo, put it here.

13:06.674 --> 13:09.218
Get your hand outta my face, all right?

13:10.469 --> 13:11.470
Oh.

13:11.596 --> 13:13.639
Hodges, you back, huh?

13:14.807 --> 13:18.895
- What's up, homes?
- Hey, turn the music down, man.

13:19.020 --> 13:23.482
- Hey, fuck that! That ain't my job.
- You better watch your back, man.

13:23.608 --> 13:26.569
Nice ride, man. I didn't make it.

13:27.570 --> 13:32.325
- Why you sneakin' up on us like that?
- You wanna get back on the sidewalk?

13:33.659 --> 13:38.539
- You're all buffed out. Been to the joint?
- Just County. Missed you for a while.

13:39.749 --> 13:42.376
You out on good time? What's this?

13:43.336 --> 13:46.422
Oh, this here's my Hopalong Cassidy rag.

13:47.423 --> 13:49.304
Get rid of it.

13:50.509 --> 13:55.473
- Find better friends. You're in violation.
- Hey, I live right there. I'm just passin' by.

13:56.140 --> 13:58.517
- What's the matter with him?
- Who, Rocket?

13:58.684 --> 14:03.397
- Don't he like it around here?
- Cuz is down for the hood, man.

14:08.110 --> 14:10.238
Y'all got any dope today?

14:10.613 --> 14:14.033
Not us. We just say no to drugs.

14:14.492 --> 14:18.412
- You go get some. I'll be right back.
- All right, man. Get some for us.

14:19.205 --> 14:20.831
Yeah, you bet.

14:20.957 --> 14:24.293
Hey, later on, Hodges.
Take care of yourself, homeboy.

14:24.418 --> 14:26.462
They ain't got nothin', cuz.

14:28.005 --> 14:30.049
Hodges has a new partner.

14:37.515 --> 14:41.185
Fuckin' Melindez, man. I cannot
believe I'm back out here. Man!

14:41.310 --> 14:45.398
I worked CRASH for five years.
I did my time. Finally made it up to Juvie.

14:45.523 --> 14:49.902
Home at night with the wife. Get to
help somebody every once in a while...

14:50.027 --> 14:53.114
Here I am. Same old shit.

14:58.869 --> 15:00.705
He don't wanna see us.

15:02.832 --> 15:04.875
Freeze.

15:05.209 --> 15:07.461
Stop, asshole!

15:11.716 --> 15:13.718
Fuckhead!

15:15.344 --> 15:17.054
Don't move.

15:17.179 --> 15:20.141
That's what you get
for messin' with the police.

15:20.266 --> 15:24.478
Hands behind your heads, interlock your
fingers, down on your knees. Let's go.

15:24.604 --> 15:26.647
Cross your ankles. Don't move.

15:28.441 --> 15:29.692
Drop it.

15:29.859 --> 15:33.946
1-CRASH-32. Requesting backup.
My partner's on foot in an alley.

15:34.071 --> 15:36.324
1200... South Main.

15:41.078 --> 15:45.750
OK, you kids, get outta here. Get lost. Go
home. These guys are creeps. Go home!

15:45.875 --> 15:47.919
Go on!

15:48.628 --> 15:50.755
Bring him out here, McGavin.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.554
Homes, what d'you think I'm gonna
find when I look under that car, huh?

15:58.721 --> 16:00.556
Huh?

16:04.101 --> 16:07.396
You don't run from
the fastest white boy on two feet.

16:08.898 --> 16:12.360
Oh, man, you smell good, homes.
What is that? Eau de doo-dah-day?

16:16.530 --> 16:18.574
I saw him toss it.

16:21.619 --> 16:23.955
What the hell were you runnin' for?

16:25.414 --> 16:27.500
Answer me, asshole.

16:28.584 --> 16:30.628
Answer me.

16:31.212 --> 16:33.464
What's your name?

16:34.173 --> 16:36.842
- What's your name?
- Clarence Brown.

16:37.176 --> 16:40.930
- Don't lie to me.
- Clarence Brown.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.444
- How old are you?
- 18.

16:56.070 --> 16:58.114
How old are you?

16:58.573 --> 16:59.991
14.

17:01.409 --> 17:04.787
What else do they call you?
What's your name on the street?

17:04.912 --> 17:06.955
Give me another name.

17:10.501 --> 17:12.752
- High Top.
- Why do they call you that?

17:12.878 --> 17:17.258
You a second-storey man, High Top?
You go down on basketball players?

17:18.300 --> 17:22.512
What do you hang out with this loser for?
Wanna be like him? You do, don't you?

17:22.637 --> 17:24.265
No.

17:28.060 --> 17:31.105
- What's your heart beatin' for?
- I'm scared, man.

17:31.355 --> 17:33.816
I thought you were runnin' a marathon.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.334
Got it.

17:51.459 --> 17:53.920
Stand up. Let's see your tattoos.

18:00.051 --> 18:02.929
Oh, man, homes. It's fuckin' Gibraltar.

18:05.848 --> 18:08.726
- Look at the red. He's a Blood. Let's see.
- What?

18:08.893 --> 18:13.022
- Recognise this?
- Cancel Christmas. You're dead.

18:13.147 --> 18:16.651
- You on parole or probation?
- No.

18:16.776 --> 18:19.695
Well, I got you on my file now.

18:20.655 --> 18:25.785
If I catch you here again, I'm gonna shove
this up your ass. How would that feel?

18:31.457 --> 18:33.334
Uncuff him.

18:33.459 --> 18:35.503
Uncuff him.

18:37.004 --> 18:39.048
You heard me.

18:44.053 --> 18:46.806
- I'm Hodges. Ask around who I am.
- Yeah.

18:46.931 --> 18:48.849
- You owe me one, OK?
- Yeah.

18:48.975 --> 18:51.018
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.

18:51.936 --> 18:53.980
Say it.

18:55.690 --> 18:57.942
- I owe you one.
- OK.

18:58.067 --> 19:00.111
Get outta here.

19:02.238 --> 19:04.532
This alley is hot.

19:04.699 --> 19:06.742
It's no longer yours, it's mine.

19:08.786 --> 19:12.123
If I catch you here again,
I'm gonna arrest you.

19:12.248 --> 19:15.126
Be straight with me,
I'll be straight with you.

19:15.251 --> 19:18.212
Now, all of you, get lost.
Let's go. Come on. Out!

19:18.337 --> 19:20.131
- Come on, man. Let's go.
- Go on.

19:20.256 --> 19:22.466
- We'll get him round the corner.
- Right on.

19:22.633 --> 19:24.844
I'm down for that.

19:26.095 --> 19:28.139
I'll drive.

19:41.068 --> 19:43.446
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

19:43.613 --> 19:46.157
I made a righteous collar
back there, partner.

19:46.324 --> 19:50.411
If I do something, I expect you to back
me up and I hope you expect the same.

19:50.536 --> 19:54.206
Oh. You don't even know the area, yet you
wanna drag him in for a pissy little rock...

19:54.373 --> 19:57.627
and spend the rest of the shift
doin' paperwork? Is that a plan?

19:57.752 --> 20:00.046
- You wanna hear a plan? I got a plan.
- Yeah.

20:00.421 --> 20:02.882
We get him for rock,
then for somethin' else...

20:03.049 --> 20:07.678
and when he does something serious,
it's not a first fuckin' offence!

20:15.269 --> 20:20.691
Male causing disturbance
at parking lot, corner of 9th and Figueroa.

20:23.110 --> 20:24.028
Shit.

20:32.370 --> 20:36.582
OK, that's your plan. All right.
Now you wanna hear mine?

20:36.707 --> 20:39.627
You're full of fuckin' adrenaline, man.
You know...

20:39.752 --> 20:43.089
You're not chasin' around
Mickey Mouse crimes any more.

20:43.256 --> 20:47.176
Now, the plan as I see it
is to get to know these guys...

20:47.301 --> 20:50.388
so then when somethin' big
does come along...

20:51.305 --> 20:53.140
You wanna listen or what?

20:54.517 --> 20:56.102
What?

20:56.227 --> 20:59.272
You wanna look at pussy
or learn about this job? Which is it?

21:03.526 --> 21:05.903
You heard the one about the two bulls?

21:06.779 --> 21:08.990
Not yet.

21:09.115 --> 21:11.158
Not yet, huh?

21:12.201 --> 21:16.330
These two bulls are sittin' on a knoll
overlookin' a herd of Guernseys...

21:16.455 --> 21:22.378
and the baby bull says "Hey, Pop, let's
run down and fuck one of those cows."

21:22.503 --> 21:25.172
But the papa bull says "No, Son."

21:26.048 --> 21:28.092
"Let's walk down."

21:28.217 --> 21:30.261
"Fuck 'em all."

21:43.983 --> 21:46.944
Unit 15, what is your location?

21:52.325 --> 21:55.328
- When d'you get outta jail?
- What?

21:56.370 --> 21:58.664
I could put a word in with Parole.

22:01.876 --> 22:03.920
- What's your name?
- Louisa.

22:04.754 --> 22:06.464
Danny.

22:06.589 --> 22:08.674
Hi, Danny.

22:08.799 --> 22:11.802
So you get time off for good behaviour?

22:13.304 --> 22:15.348
You ever go out with a cop?

22:16.766 --> 22:18.976
You don't like cops, do you?

22:20.061 --> 22:21.771
No.

22:21.896 --> 22:25.233
- No what?
- No sale. Let's go.

22:25.358 --> 22:26.901
Yeah, sure.

22:27.735 --> 22:29.904
I will be back.

22:30.029 --> 22:33.449
I really love... your coffee, Louisa.

22:34.533 --> 22:36.452
Bye.

22:36.577 --> 22:38.621
Bye.

23:02.603 --> 23:05.231
- You're jealous.
- That's right.

23:05.356 --> 23:08.693
But I got a wife at home
whom I love, and three kids.

23:08.818 --> 23:13.573
- Yeah, well, that don't mean shit.
- That's why I'm jealous.

23:14.532 --> 23:17.076
You don't wanna get laid, man.

23:17.201 --> 23:20.788
It leads to kissin',
and pretty soon you gotta talk to 'em.

23:40.057 --> 23:43.728
White Fence are the oldest gang in LA.
There's three or four generations.

23:43.895 --> 23:47.732
I don't know if you remember...
they threatened that lady DA last year.

23:49.650 --> 23:51.903
What's up?

23:52.028 --> 23:55.072
- Nice ride.
- Hodges, what's happenin'?

23:55.197 --> 23:56.991
Not much.

23:57.116 --> 24:00.244
You still smokin' that PCP?
Make you stupid, man.

24:00.369 --> 24:03.706
No, I don't fuck with juice.
This is weed.

24:03.831 --> 24:05.875
Peewees smoke that shit. I don't.

24:06.417 --> 24:10.004
You seen any... gang members around?

24:10.713 --> 24:13.090
Who, me? I ain't seen any gang members.

24:13.257 --> 24:15.301
You seen any gang members?

24:29.941 --> 24:32.401
Check these vatos.

24:35.529 --> 24:38.616
- 21st Street on our list?
- Nah.

24:38.741 --> 24:41.369
Poor fuckers are professional victims.

24:41.494 --> 24:44.789
Get their ass kicked constantly.

24:44.914 --> 24:46.958
Kind of a mixed gang.

24:47.708 --> 24:51.003
You got Diamond Street there, the Ville,
and the projects on the west.

24:51.128 --> 24:54.215
So they gotta fight their way in
and fight their way out.

24:54.340 --> 24:57.510
- They're fucked, huh?
- They are fucked.

25:00.078 --> 25:01.222
Jesus!

25:24.203 --> 25:29.166
What're you gonna do? Stand in the street
and wave your fist? Let's go. Come on!

26:11.959 --> 26:14.003
Hey, what you guys doin'?

26:23.221 --> 26:26.098
Stay where you are.
Drop and you're dead, buddy.

26:35.608 --> 26:38.903
OK. All right, let's line up.
Come on, let's go.

26:39.028 --> 26:41.155
Come on. Right up here. Let's go.

26:41.322 --> 26:43.366
Let's go. Come on.

26:44.784 --> 26:46.827
All right.

26:49.413 --> 26:53.167
What's the matter with you?
Put that fuckin' thing away!

26:55.878 --> 26:57.838
Asshole.

27:11.185 --> 27:15.106
Hey, get your hands outta your pockets.
Put your hands behind your neck.

27:15.273 --> 27:17.024
Come on. And you.

27:17.149 --> 27:21.529
Are you guys stupid or what? Throwin'
rocks at our car... This is my office.

27:21.821 --> 27:23.906
What are you, crazy?

27:24.156 --> 27:27.243
Get your hands up.
Gimme your fingers, man.

27:28.703 --> 27:30.746
Spread your legs. Wider.

27:31.289 --> 27:33.165
Spread your fuckin' legs, homes.

27:33.875 --> 27:35.501
Who threw the rock?

27:40.047 --> 27:41.883
Oh.

27:42.633 --> 27:46.470
We can have it any way you want.
You wanna have an understanding?

27:46.637 --> 27:49.307
Are we gonna have
some kind of rapport or what?

27:50.016 --> 27:52.226
- What's that?
- Cigarettes.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.565
- You have any fuckin' primos in there?
- Chale, homes.

27:57.690 --> 27:59.734
OK, get out.

28:00.610 --> 28:02.653
What do you wanna have?

28:05.281 --> 28:09.744
- Hodges, still with that rapport shit, huh?
- Hey. How you doin'?

28:10.703 --> 28:13.956
What's my little brother
doin' up in that tree?

28:14.457 --> 28:17.168
- Thinks he's a monkey vato, eh?
- Stay up there.

28:17.293 --> 28:19.337
You heard the man.

28:20.838 --> 28:24.050
- Little brother?
- Simón.

28:24.634 --> 28:26.761
What's your name, little brother?

28:27.136 --> 28:29.597
- Tell him your name, homes.
- Felipe.

28:30.973 --> 28:34.310
- That's my partner, McGavin.
- What's your name, man?

28:34.435 --> 28:36.562
- Huh?
- Larry.

28:36.687 --> 28:38.522
Larry.

28:42.318 --> 28:44.362
New partner.

28:47.615 --> 28:49.659
OK, Larry. Get over there.

28:51.994 --> 28:55.581
Larry Sylvester. Looney Tunes.

28:55.706 --> 28:58.042
What's the matter
with the peewees, homes?

28:58.167 --> 29:01.754
- What?
- They threw a rock at my brand-new car.

29:04.006 --> 29:06.300
Who threw the rock?

29:07.218 --> 29:09.262
Who threw it?!

29:17.436 --> 29:21.941
- You're a stupid fuck, you know that?
- No future in it, homie.

29:23.859 --> 29:28.656
- So you're back in the jungles, homes?
- This ain't the jungle. This is Disneyland.

29:32.827 --> 29:34.870
So how we gonna teach them?

29:35.997 --> 29:39.667
I don't know, Hodges. I don't know, man.

29:39.792 --> 29:42.837
I don't know about this
younger generation, homes.

29:45.923 --> 29:48.759
You come down, Felipe.
I'm gonna beat your ass.

29:52.513 --> 29:55.349
Well, keep the homeboys
in line, all right?

29:55.892 --> 29:57.935
Yes, sir.

29:58.728 --> 30:00.771
Have a good day.

30:02.356 --> 30:04.901
All right, homes.

30:05.067 --> 30:09.447
I didn't mean to jump on your case,
it's just you were blowin' my deal.

30:18.539 --> 30:22.126
Our community have kids out there
who are dying over colours.

30:22.251 --> 30:26.797
I mean, actually dying over red or blue.
And what we need is your help.

30:26.923 --> 30:30.426
We need you to testify when
you see something going on out there.

30:30.551 --> 30:34.222
We're outnumbered, we're outgunned,
we're tired. We need your help.

30:34.388 --> 30:37.016
You mean the cops
don't have enough guns? Shit!

30:37.141 --> 30:41.479
- You wanna know why they pull this shit?
- Cos there ain't no jobs out there!

30:41.604 --> 30:45.441
Hell with 'em all!
Throw all the motherfuckers in jail, huh?

30:45.566 --> 30:49.403
I know all about bein' outgunned,
all right? I mean, I was in Vietnam.

30:49.528 --> 30:50.696
Yeah!

30:50.863 --> 30:54.408
It ain't about what you got in your hand.
It's about what the people want.

30:54.533 --> 30:58.287
That's what it is, man.
You're doggone right that's what it is.

30:58.454 --> 31:02.542
- It's what the people want.
- Wait. Let the man talk, all right?

31:02.667 --> 31:06.504
I used to run with a gang, all right?
Now I work with 'em.

31:06.671 --> 31:08.839
I just wanna make a point here.

31:08.965 --> 31:13.010
The reality on the streets is
the dope dealer has the Mercedes-Benz...

31:13.135 --> 31:17.932
the money and the women. Now, these
kids have eyes. They see what's goin' on.

31:18.057 --> 31:22.562
And that is their socialisation.
It's the values that they respect.

31:22.687 --> 31:25.231
We don't educate 'em.
We don't give 'em jobs.

31:25.398 --> 31:28.317
We know all that.
Why don't you do somethin' about it?

31:28.442 --> 31:31.404
Look, what we need
is some damn protection.

31:31.529 --> 31:35.616
- Then you've got to get involved.
- Why the fuck d'you think we're here?

31:35.741 --> 31:38.578
We're fed up! We're sick of this shit!

31:38.703 --> 31:41.247
The police are never gonna get anywhere.

31:41.414 --> 31:45.001
Shakin' people down,
shinin' their lights in our eyes.

31:45.126 --> 31:48.713
Treatin' all of us like criminals
cos of where we live!

31:48.880 --> 31:52.800
- And right in front of our kids!
- D'you know where your kids are now?

31:54.760 --> 31:56.095
Fuck you!

31:56.220 --> 31:59.140
- Fuck you, man!
- You don't go botherin' me about my kid.

32:03.043 --> 32:06.772
Calm down! Please hold it down.
Let's come to order!

32:18.159 --> 32:20.328
<i>Soon, and very soon</i>

32:20.453 --> 32:23.664
<i>We are going to see the King</i>

32:23.789 --> 32:26.500
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah</i>

32:26.626 --> 32:29.962
<i>We are going to see the King</i>

32:30.087 --> 32:32.048
<i>Oh, Lord God in heaven</i>

32:32.173 --> 32:35.384
<i>We are going to see the King</i>

32:35.509 --> 32:38.304
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah</i>

32:38.429 --> 32:40.473
<i>We are going to see the King</i>

32:40.598 --> 32:44.018
<i>Oh, I said soon, and very soon</i>

32:44.143 --> 32:47.647
<i>We are going to see the King</i>

32:47.772 --> 32:49.732
<i>Soon, and very soon</i>

32:49.857 --> 32:52.193
<i>We are going to see the King</i>

32:52.318 --> 32:55.613
<i>Oh, I said soon, and very soon</i>

32:55.738 --> 32:58.282
<i>We are going to see the King</i>

32:58.449 --> 33:01.327
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah</i>

33:01.452 --> 33:06.834
<i>We are going to see the King</i>

33:10.419 --> 33:14.674
I want to thank Miss Loretta Thomas
and her choir...

33:14.799 --> 33:18.719
greet the congregation and
all the rest of you who have chosen...

33:18.844 --> 33:22.056
to grace our church on this special day.

33:23.474 --> 33:28.521
What makes this day so special?
"What is so special?" you ask.

33:28.688 --> 33:31.983
Another black boy bites the dust
to which thou art returned.

33:34.277 --> 33:37.947
I knew this boy, this Robert Craig...

33:38.114 --> 33:40.491
whose mama brought him up
as best she could.

33:40.658 --> 33:43.870
- It wasn't lack of love that killed him.
- Amen!

33:43.995 --> 33:46.539
It was the scourge of drugs and gangs.

33:46.706 --> 33:48.749
That's right.

33:49.208 --> 33:54.171
And what makes this day so special is,
we have now declared war upon this plague!

33:54.338 --> 33:55.339
Yeah!

33:55.464 --> 34:00.177
Till we see that this scourge of
gang violence is driven from our streets!

34:01.137 --> 34:04.682
We've been bullied too long
by these sawed-off gangsters.

34:04.807 --> 34:07.727
These gangbangers,
as they call themselves.

34:08.853 --> 34:12.440
And now it is time for decent folk...

34:12.565 --> 34:16.027
- for people of God, to start bangin' back.
- Amen!

34:16.360 --> 34:19.572
- Are we afraid of these hoodlums?
- No.

34:19.697 --> 34:21.866
- I said, are we afraid?
- No!

34:29.998 --> 34:31.708
They hit, goddamn it!

34:47.308 --> 34:51.938
We have a black and white following
a black Ford LTD. Request air unit.

34:52.063 --> 34:54.273
- Fuck!
- Shit!

34:54.398 --> 34:58.611
Eastbound in alley
between 113 and 114 from Wilmington.

35:30.184 --> 35:33.604
Air units, come in
on southeast frequency.

35:33.771 --> 35:35.606
Air 18. Go ahead.

35:48.202 --> 35:50.830
Keep this motherfucker goin'!

35:56.836 --> 35:59.046
Fuckin' asshole!

36:03.342 --> 36:07.889
Get outta Dodge, you motherfuckers.
Eat shit and die, motherfuckers!

36:12.393 --> 36:14.770
Get these cops. Fuck 'em up!

36:14.896 --> 36:16.939
Air 18, respond to shots fired.

36:29.202 --> 36:31.495
That fuckin' bitch can drive, man.

37:05.112 --> 37:08.866
Air 18. Code six. Have three suspects...

37:13.955 --> 37:17.333
Assholes. Fuck. Crips, Bloods...

37:59.834 --> 38:02.003
Oh, shit!

38:27.904 --> 38:31.657
My wife, uh...
says she wants to meet you.

38:34.744 --> 38:37.038
She says, uh...

38:37.205 --> 38:39.665
- you can bring a date.
- Thanks.

38:44.462 --> 38:47.089
Jesus Christ!

38:47.215 --> 38:51.052
So we had Linda, you know.
She's 18 now, right?

38:51.219 --> 38:54.722
And then Bobby said
"Well, why don't we try for a boy?"

38:54.889 --> 38:59.017
So I thought Tommie for sure
was gonna be our last one, but...

38:59.142 --> 39:01.437
these things happen!

39:02.063 --> 39:04.315
Well, they better not.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.567
Oh, no. You heard what he said?

39:08.152 --> 39:10.905
Jumbo shrimp! There's a contradiction.

39:11.030 --> 39:13.824
- $14.95 a pound.
- Bobby...!

39:13.950 --> 39:15.952
Hey, he's my partner.

39:16.077 --> 39:19.997
What's money to two highly paid
professionals of LA's best? Right?

39:20.164 --> 39:21.999
- Right.
- Let me go help you.

39:22.124 --> 39:25.878
- No, honey. Sit down.
- It's OK. I'll just come. Later, dear.

39:29.423 --> 39:31.676
Prick. Bastard.

39:31.801 --> 39:33.427
You dog.

39:33.553 --> 39:38.099
You better treat her right,
or her Mexican mama's gonna chop it off.

39:38.224 --> 39:41.018
- A fuckin' angel.
- I know.

39:44.355 --> 39:47.108
Pretty fancy drivin'
the other day, McGavin.

39:49.068 --> 39:51.612
I mean, we didn't
have to try and catch 'em.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.282
Are you sayin' I wouldn't have?

39:54.407 --> 39:57.743
Well, if I was you,
a year before pension...

39:57.869 --> 40:00.246
a wife like that, a kid...

40:00.413 --> 40:02.623
Three kids. That's bullshit.

40:05.585 --> 40:08.254
D'you wanna get into this now?

40:11.674 --> 40:13.801
I don't understand you. I really don't.

40:14.302 --> 40:16.178
You wanna psychoanalyse me?

40:16.387 --> 40:20.308
- Where'd you get your fuckin' hard-on?
- Ask me if I loved my mother.

40:20.433 --> 40:23.561
I used to get jacked up
cos I thought I needed that edge.

40:24.270 --> 40:28.107
Well, maybe you don't, maybe I do.
Maybe we're just different.

40:28.774 --> 40:33.529
What I remember most from that time
is nothing but regrets.

40:33.654 --> 40:37.700
Let me tell you something: you can't
prove anything out on the streets.

40:37.825 --> 40:42.747
What you do is a job. You can try to be a
professional... that's the best you can do.

40:43.664 --> 40:45.791
Now in 19 years I've learned one thing.

40:45.917 --> 40:50.296
If you try to fight every jerk on the street,
you'll be one sad, sorry son of a bitch.

40:50.421 --> 40:52.673
And you'll never last 20 years.

40:52.798 --> 40:56.636
And God forbid if you ever get married
and take it out on your wife.

40:56.761 --> 40:59.222
She will walk.
She will fucking leave you.

41:03.267 --> 41:05.436
So why make it worse all the time?

41:06.520 --> 41:09.941
- Is that one thing?
- Yeah, one thing.

41:10.107 --> 41:12.235
It's all one thing.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.196
- The other day...
- This isn't to do with that.

41:15.321 --> 41:18.282
- Shut up! Uh, do I get to talk?
- Talk.

41:19.534 --> 41:23.621
I'm sorry about the car.
I fuckin' wiped out. What can I say?

41:23.746 --> 41:26.666
You want me to say
it's not gonna happen again?

41:27.458 --> 41:30.002
I know what you're saying
and trying to do...

41:30.169 --> 41:34.966
but I didn't volunteer for CRASH to play
games and be nice to these assholes.

41:36.425 --> 41:40.888
Think you get respect? They laugh and
fuck somebody up. I can't deal with that.

41:41.013 --> 41:45.351
If you don't think you can deal with me,
well, I understand that, too.

42:02.702 --> 42:04.537
- Well?
- What?

42:04.662 --> 42:08.249
- So tell me about him.
- Well, I will tell you later.

42:09.333 --> 42:13.087
- Gimme the baby. Louisa?
- No, it's all right. I enjoy it.

42:15.214 --> 42:17.675
How do you want me to cook those shrimp?

42:17.800 --> 42:20.261
Oh, butterfly 'em.

42:29.228 --> 42:31.272
What's up?

42:31.939 --> 42:33.816
Nothin'.

42:33.941 --> 42:35.776
You OK?

42:35.902 --> 42:37.737
Yeah.

42:46.996 --> 42:50.750
- Here I come!
- Look at your brother there. Look.

42:58.216 --> 43:00.259
Now look what I got.

43:30.998 --> 43:35.294
Hey, homes. You kiddin' me, homes?
Listen up, homes. Listen up.

43:35.419 --> 43:38.089
That dude was fly, homes.

43:38.256 --> 43:40.466
He so fly, he gone.

43:40.591 --> 43:44.178
He made his own from the kerb, man.
Over and out.

43:44.929 --> 43:47.181
Boom! Yeah.

43:48.599 --> 43:50.643
Hey, Larry.

43:51.686 --> 43:54.355
- You can make it out too, man.
- How?

43:56.148 --> 43:59.443
Maybe I'll go to Hollywood,
be Eddie Murphy.

44:00.278 --> 44:03.948
Frog, you think America's ready
to love two niggers at the same time?

44:04.115 --> 44:06.200
Chale, homes.

44:06.492 --> 44:09.745
- You been talkin' to Bird too long, eh?
- Say what?

44:10.121 --> 44:12.999
I say you been talkin' to Bird too long.

44:17.128 --> 44:20.798
- He says there's no future in it.
- Ain't no future but what you make it.

44:20.923 --> 44:22.967
- Shit.
- Bangin' is shit!

44:23.092 --> 44:27.388
Listen, homes! Hey, see, man,
that's just the way the world is, ese.

44:27.513 --> 44:31.100
There's always gonna be gangs.
There's always gonna be fighting.

44:31.225 --> 44:36.272
Always was and always is, man.
Nobody's gonna fuckin' stop it, man.

44:36.439 --> 44:38.524
That's just life.

44:38.900 --> 44:42.486
- You can stop it for yourselves.
- Fuck you. I don't wanna stop nothin'!

44:42.612 --> 44:46.449
- Fuck you, you stupid fuckin' asshole.
- Fuck you back, man!

44:46.616 --> 44:48.743
Tell your fairy tales to somebody else.

44:49.243 --> 44:51.787
What am I gonna do with you guys, man?

44:51.913 --> 44:56.292
What do you mean? What the fuck
you mean, what you gonna do, man?

44:57.084 --> 44:59.295
Who the fuck sent you anyway, homes?

45:01.964 --> 45:04.175
- Hodges.
- Hodges?!

45:06.135 --> 45:11.974
Yeah, he thinks maybe you're smart
enough to walk away from this bullshit.

45:12.099 --> 45:16.270
- But you're too stupid to realise it.
- What does Hodges know, man? Huh?

45:16.437 --> 45:18.397
Fuck Hodges, man!

45:18.522 --> 45:21.192
Where does Hodges come from anyway, huh?

45:21.859 --> 45:25.279
See, man, these are my homeboys, vato.

45:25.905 --> 45:28.658
See, our homie here is all we have, man.

45:30.660 --> 45:32.703
I love them...

45:34.622 --> 45:37.500
They love me back, man.

45:38.876 --> 45:42.129
Mi barrio es primero, man.

45:47.718 --> 45:50.388
D'you want me
to walk away from this, man?

45:51.430 --> 45:53.057
No way.

45:53.182 --> 45:54.917
Fuck you. No way, man.

45:59.428 --> 46:01.472
You can stop over there.

46:17.780 --> 46:19.740
I had a nice time.

46:19.866 --> 46:21.909
Thank you.

46:26.581 --> 46:28.416
Hey.

46:29.458 --> 46:31.502
- What?
- Look over here.

46:33.713 --> 46:35.756
Where?

46:37.466 --> 46:39.510
Closer.

46:40.553 --> 46:42.597
What?

46:43.598 --> 46:45.641
Lookin' pretty good.

46:50.354 --> 46:52.398
I like you, too.

46:53.232 --> 46:55.276
I didn't say that.

46:57.111 --> 46:59.447
Tough guy, huh?

46:59.572 --> 47:03.326
You know, everybody around here
is so tough that...

47:03.493 --> 47:05.703
that doesn't get to me.

47:06.454 --> 47:08.498
What does?

47:09.207 --> 47:11.250
Be nice.

47:14.462 --> 47:18.132
- Wanna tell me what you were thinking?
- No. Uh... no!

47:20.051 --> 47:22.595
OK. I'm gonna go then.

47:22.762 --> 47:25.306
No, no, no, no, no. I'll drive you down.

47:25.473 --> 47:27.517
This is a bad area.

47:29.018 --> 47:32.271
- I'll bring you down.
- Danny, I'm a homegirl.

47:32.396 --> 47:35.233
This is my barrio, remember?

47:35.358 --> 47:37.360
I'm safe.

47:37.485 --> 47:40.404
Now they see me with you, maybe I'm not.

47:44.826 --> 47:46.869
Good night.

48:05.137 --> 48:07.181
Come here.

49:08.201 --> 49:11.829
- She was that good?
- Yeah. The biggest tits I ever saw.

49:20.087 --> 49:22.131
This fuckin' paperwork!

49:25.092 --> 49:29.430
Excuse me! Hello? Anyone know
where the valet parking is?

49:38.648 --> 49:41.901
Hey, how do I look?
I don't mean relative to you, of course.

49:42.026 --> 49:45.696
- Looks like they got a lemon.
- It looks like a Pac-Man.

49:45.863 --> 49:49.909
- Oh, yeah, gobble them assholes up.
- Hey, hey, ooh. Pac-Man.

49:50.034 --> 49:53.538
- That's my street name.
- Got a registration for that?

49:54.163 --> 49:58.000
- I'll registrate your ass.
- Take all you bluecoats to try.

49:58.167 --> 50:02.797
- Let's go get some of this juicy booty.
- Juicy booty!

50:02.922 --> 50:04.841
Come on, we ain't goin' in that.

50:05.216 --> 50:08.344
1-Mary-11, 1-Mary-11, meet 1-Mary-10...

50:08.469 --> 50:10.805
How'd you get involved?

50:10.930 --> 50:14.225
Shit. Sheriff's got
the best intelligence, man.

50:15.852 --> 50:18.312
We the ones called you in.

50:18.479 --> 50:20.773
Yeah?

50:20.898 --> 50:25.903
I noticed all those gangbang assholes
drivin' fire extinguishers off the docks.

50:26.154 --> 50:31.492
I couldn't figure out why they was so
concerned about puttin' out a fuckin' fire.

50:31.617 --> 50:35.538
So I'm checkin' out the fire extinguishers,
and it goes off in my hands.

50:36.581 --> 50:41.127
They put the coke in the holes, you
know? So the evidence gets destroyed.

50:42.503 --> 50:45.590
I nearly froze my fuckin' balls off.

50:47.133 --> 50:52.013
35-Charlie-22. 212 Collins Street.
2-1-2 Collins Street.

50:52.555 --> 50:57.351
The fire extinguisher's made in Taiwan,
comes from Colombia on a Panama boat.

50:57.935 --> 51:00.146
11-George, are you ready?

51:01.564 --> 51:04.484
11-Georgia. So, Big Bird,
let's do it to it!

52:18.516 --> 52:21.060
Police! We have a search warrant.
Open up!

52:24.689 --> 52:28.860
Freeze! Stand the fuck up!
Turn around! Keep your fuckin' hands up!

52:28.985 --> 52:32.488
Stand the fuck up! Turn around!
Get your fuckin' hands up in the air!

52:32.613 --> 52:36.367
Put 'em behind your fuckin' head!
Put 'em behind your head!

52:38.661 --> 52:40.705
Fuck! Don't move!

52:45.501 --> 52:47.545
OK, we're inside.

52:49.714 --> 52:53.134
- What have you got?
- I don't know. Check back there.

53:03.102 --> 53:06.939
- He's got a gauge.
- Doin' some duck huntin', asshole?

53:20.828 --> 53:24.332
- I didn't get his lower half yet.
- I'll get it.

53:40.681 --> 53:42.808
Cuff this fuckin' gorilla.

53:57.615 --> 54:00.535
All right, get him
on his goddamn feet. Now!

54:00.660 --> 54:03.037
Help me lift him. Help me lift him.

54:07.202 --> 54:09.245
Hey, now, Oso.

54:10.038 --> 54:13.708
- Oso means "bear" in Spanish, huh, Oso?
- Simón.

54:13.833 --> 54:16.920
Well, ain't this a fuckin' bear, Oso?

54:19.255 --> 54:21.382
You know what I want from you, man?

54:22.217 --> 54:24.010
Five names.

54:24.511 --> 54:28.348
You ain't shit. We'll fuck you.
Send you to county jail.

54:28.765 --> 54:32.769
Or you give us five names,
stand back of court, and walk.

54:32.894 --> 54:35.188
Is that understood?

54:35.980 --> 54:38.024
We ain't talkin' no DA deal now.

54:38.691 --> 54:41.486
I don't know anybody, officer.

54:41.611 --> 54:46.032
Search warrant. Resistin' arrest. Want
more? You're messin' with a sheriff now.

54:46.157 --> 54:48.535
If I talk?

54:48.660 --> 54:51.413
Gun clean, you walk,
right here, right now.

54:53.164 --> 54:57.627
Fuck it. Sheriff,
you got Chango, Mosca and Trian.

54:58.378 --> 55:01.798
That's good. I know those assholes
as well as I know my own.

55:01.923 --> 55:05.218
Now, who take it to the city?
For my friends here.

55:05.927 --> 55:10.265
Who take the coke out the hose?
Who is Smokey the Bear?

55:12.767 --> 55:14.644
A cat named Winky and High Top.

55:16.980 --> 55:19.065
- High Top?
- I'm not lyin', man.

55:19.190 --> 55:22.277
I don't owe them pinche myates
a fuckin' thing!

55:26.573 --> 55:31.369
Let's go. Come on. You been a good bear.
You can go hibernate for a while.

55:33.204 --> 55:36.875
- High Top.
- I fuckin' had the motherfucker.

55:38.042 --> 55:42.255
Had what? What did we have?
A piece of rock. Big deal.

55:42.380 --> 55:44.841
Did we know he was tied in here?

55:47.135 --> 55:50.180
Oh, hey, what? Uncle Bob make a mistake?

55:52.348 --> 55:55.810
- You wanna go and second-guess me?
- No, I wanna go and bust him.

55:56.060 --> 55:58.772
So you gonna pull a fire extinguisher
out of his ass?

55:58.897 --> 56:00.857
I'll plant one there if I have to...

56:00.982 --> 56:05.987
then you can pull it out so you don't
have to dick around in the car all the time.

56:12.702 --> 56:14.913
You wanna fuckin' die? Spit it out!

56:16.289 --> 56:18.416
Spit it out!

56:18.625 --> 56:21.086
Face the wall. Down on your knees.
On your knees!

56:21.252 --> 56:24.422
Spit it out! Spit it out!
You're gonna fuckin' die.

56:25.882 --> 56:28.760
- Spit it out!
- That's enough, McGavin. Enough!

56:28.885 --> 56:33.181
My partner doesn't fuckin' care if you
die either. Fuckin' stand up. Stand up!

56:33.306 --> 56:35.350
Keep your hands behind your head.

56:36.893 --> 56:38.937
Get down!

56:42.607 --> 56:47.028
Your homeboy is gonna fuckin' die, OK?
He's gonna start turnin' blue and dyin'.

56:47.153 --> 56:50.406
If somebody gives a fuck,
they'll bring him to the hospital.

56:50.532 --> 56:55.078
- Don't fuckin' dance on me, OK?
- Enough. McGavin! Enough, hotshot.

57:05.672 --> 57:09.092
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

57:09.217 --> 57:13.930
Hold on. What are you doin', Picasso?
Crossin' out the names of your friends?

57:14.055 --> 57:17.725
Not gonna like that, are they?
Put your hands on your head.

57:19.644 --> 57:22.105
You at war with these guys now?

57:22.647 --> 57:26.234
Well, they're not gonna
like that one bit, my friend.

57:26.693 --> 57:28.736
I'll tell you what.

57:29.446 --> 57:31.489
Turn around, White Fence.

57:32.824 --> 57:36.161
Why don't you graffiti on this mural?
Why don't you do that?

57:37.454 --> 57:41.458
Cos they'll kill your fuckin' ass
and you know that, right, homes?

57:41.583 --> 57:45.670
Now, if I were you, I'd get out
of this neighbourhood right away.

57:46.087 --> 57:47.922
Hey.

57:49.007 --> 57:51.050
This is a misdemeanour.

57:51.760 --> 57:54.053
We could take you to jail for this.

57:54.179 --> 57:58.933
But I got a plan. We can work somethin'
out. Ever heard of Earl Scheib, homes?

58:02.979 --> 58:05.023
That's enough of that shit!

58:06.524 --> 58:09.903
What should I have done?
Put masking tape on his ears?

58:10.987 --> 58:13.031
Go on, get outta here.

58:14.365 --> 58:16.409
Fuck you, Pac-Man!

58:21.748 --> 58:24.626
- Here's your lemonade.
- Thank you, darlin'.

58:24.751 --> 58:29.089
So, like I was sayin', everything's
goin' all right. You're doin' a good job.

58:29.214 --> 58:33.218
You down for your crime,
so don't worry about nothin', man.

58:33.343 --> 58:36.429
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Yes.

58:38.264 --> 58:40.308
Pac-Man!

58:51.319 --> 58:53.363
Stand up.

58:53.988 --> 58:56.032
I said stand up!

58:56.991 --> 58:59.035
Get your hands behind your head.

59:03.248 --> 59:05.792
Where your friends goin', dealer man?

59:05.959 --> 59:09.254
You're usin' ten-year-olds
to carry your dope now?

59:10.171 --> 59:12.382
What's this? You a brain surgeon?

59:12.507 --> 59:14.551
Dr Feelgood?

59:25.061 --> 59:27.188
Look at this shit.

59:28.440 --> 59:31.526
- Where'd you get this?
- My auntie.

59:31.651 --> 59:36.531
Man, I'm just kickin' it here. I'm just
chillin' out. What Pac-Man on me for?

59:42.996 --> 59:46.124
Keep your hands behind your head
and turn around.

59:50.837 --> 59:55.592
Who do you call when that beeper goes
off? Who's the nice man who calls you?

59:56.217 --> 59:57.469
Huh?

59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.221
Who's your connection? High Top?

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:03.433
What are you lookin' at, huh?

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:09.189
Don't you ever gimme no hard looks, cuz!

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:10.940
- Come on.
- Hey!

01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:14.903
- Just for that you're goin' to jail, homes.
- Goin' to jail?!

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.071
Aagh!

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.575
But I ain't did nothin'.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.703
- Except become a professional asshole.
- Aagh!

01:00:23.828 --> 01:00:29.209
- Man, these handcuffs is too tight!
- Well, they're not built for comfort, pal.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:33.838
- Listen, man, you ain't got nothin' on me!
- I got handcuffs on you.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.424
Say, man, you ain't got to grab my hair!

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:44.766
Ah, shit! Man, you ain't got shit on me!

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.485
Shut up!

01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:51.689
Soon I'll be out
of this motherfucker, man!

01:00:51.856 --> 01:00:55.193
All that old punk shit you doin',
that ain't nothin'!

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.529
That ain't shit!

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:02.617
Say, man, a fuckin' parole violation? I'll
be out of this motherfucker in six months.

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:05.954
- Shut up.
- These handcuffs are too tight.

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:09.040
Want me to do a little
tap dance on your head? Shut up.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:11.126
This fuckin' guy...

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.839
- What's the matter?
- I'm too old for your shit.

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:20.135
- I'm not gonna argue with that.
- Oh, yeah?

01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:23.179
You think you can handle me?
You think I'm over the hill?

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:26.599
You want a fuckin' piece of me?!
Right now, huh?

01:01:26.724 --> 01:01:32.021
You think you got the market cornered?
You think I'm not fuckin' crazy? Try me.

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:34.065
Try me, you fuck.

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.818
What are you talkin' about?

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.284
That's what I thought.

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:49.205
Hey, Hodges.

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:51.875
Uncle Bob.
I don't have any problem with you.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:56.629
Oh, no? You got problems with
the whole fuckin' world, and I'm in it.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.506
And I don't like it.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:06.222
Why don't you just chill out a little bit
and figure out which side you're on?

01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:08.808
I would if I could.

01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:11.561
But you're just like them, Pac-Man.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.064
Nothin' but a gangster.

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:28.578
Now, you've been to my house, that's
where I live. Any time. Any fuckin' time!

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:31.790
You better bring your lunch.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.217
- Will you just come out to talk?
- No!

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:44.552
- Why?
- You OK?

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.514
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:54.562
- What do you want?
- Nothing. Just... go away!

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:01.987
This is stupid. It stinks back here.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:06.074
No kidding? Well, thank you.

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:10.453
Will you just tell me what I did?

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.580
They hate you, McGavin.

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:18.795
McGavin? Oh.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:25.051
You see that badge?

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:28.096
I wear it. That's my job.
That's what I do.

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.141
So what do you want?

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:38.565
The other day you caught this boy
and put paint all over his face.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:42.318
Well, he's my cousin.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:48.992
Oh, that's funny?

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:52.495
I didn't know you had such a big family.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.622
I'm sorry. OK?

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.791
I'm sorry.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.044
You know what he was doin'?

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.383
He was crossing out the names
of East LA gang members on the wall.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.219
You know what that means
when they do that?

01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:14.392
It means they're gonna kill someone.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:18.938
So I'm sorry if I sprayed the kid's face.
Maybe I saved his life that way.

01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:21.316
- But I swear...
- I don't care!

01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:26.112
That's mean, Danny. You're sadistic.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:32.535
I am not with you.

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:36.623
I am with them, Danny. I'm a homegirl.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.043
Did they threaten you?

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:43.004
No.

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.173
No one knows I saw you.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.803
It's you who threaten me, Danny.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.890
You have a mean heart.

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.502
What's up? What can I do for you?

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:26.506
- Thanks for comin' by.
- I called you because Felipe's got...

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:29.717
Felipe got all fucked up on PCP, homes.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.474
He got whacked on that juice.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:40.228
But he's straight, homes.
He goes to school.

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:44.941
Now they got him on this gang file shit
and he ain't banging, homes.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:49.863
He ain't in no gang.
Barrio don't need him, homes.

01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:54.826
Hodges, I'm telling you this. You gotta
get him off the computer file, homes.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:59.414
Well, he's gonna have
to go to Juvie Hall anyway.

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.750
Might do him some good.
Scare him a little.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:05.545
Ah, he's scared. He's scared
of what I'm gonna do, homes.

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:11.092
Listen, get him out of the gang file. You'll
fuck up his life sure as I live, homes.

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:14.512
I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him, OK?

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:18.933
Orale! I know the routine, homes.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:20.769
I owe you one.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:23.354
That's what makes
this country great, homes.

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:25.774
- What's that?
- Credit.

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:29.819
You got your Visa card.
I got you, homes.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.698
Thanks, homes.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.412
- Hey, Frog.
- Yeah.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.581
- 21st Street, right?
- Simón.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:46.169
Leo Lopez. Homeboy, you just saved
me a trip. I got a warrant out for you.

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:48.546
Hey, homes, I'm a visitor, man.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:51.216
- Now you're a guest.
- I'm a fucking visitor.

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:54.344
Turn around. Assume the position, man!

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:59.182
- What'd he do, man?
- This clown's got 15 outstanding tickets.

01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:01.643
Hey, homes, I was gonna pay those.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:04.562
Yeah, well,
you're a little late, partner.

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:09.109
Want me to raise your bail, man?

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:12.070
Nah. I got more time than money.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.890
Dreamer.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.393
Let's go.

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.663
Good morning, officer.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:20.971
Hey!

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.265
Hey!

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:27.520
Watch it!

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:29.522
High Top!

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:36.237
Hey!

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:44.078
Hey, High Top!

01:09:46.975 --> 01:09:49.102
Everybody down! Everybody down!

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:55.150
Release the woman, motherfucker!

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:59.779
- Let's go.
- No.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:02.198
God! Please.

01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:04.492
Release the woman!

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:09.038
Give it up, asshole!

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.334
Please!

01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:16.755
Release the woman, motherfucker,
or I'll fuckin' shoot!

01:11:28.535 --> 01:11:30.995
How long you been
thinking about this one?

01:11:39.087 --> 01:11:41.297
Motherfucker!

01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:46.719
Let me see your fuckin' face, asshole!

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:50.223
You're under arrest.

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:54.769
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:12:01.025
If you give up that right, anything you say
can be used against you in a court of law.

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:07.073
You have the right to speak to an attorney
and have one present during questioning.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:12.495
If you so desire and cannot afford one,
one will be appointed for you at no cost.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.435
Hey, Bob!

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:44.319
- That was hot shit, cowboy.
- Thank you, man. Thank you.

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:46.488
For an old man.

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:49.450
Well, every dog has his day.

01:12:50.575 --> 01:12:55.955
It was my own fault, right? I mean, I was
the asshole that let him go to begin with.

01:12:57.749 --> 01:12:59.793
Hey, wait a minute.

01:13:01.086 --> 01:13:03.129
I wanna apologise.

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:06.091
- For what?
- For a lotta shit.

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:12.055
Go see a priest, say a couple of Hail
Marys. I mean, I'm not the guy for that.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:17.018
If you cut me half as much slack as you
do those assholes, I might owe you one.

01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:22.315
I have.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.067
You do.

01:13:30.949 --> 01:13:33.576
Listen, I spoke to Melindez at DSD, OK?

01:13:34.536 --> 01:13:37.622
I'll be gettin' a new partner
first of the month.

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:47.048
You ever have a bad relationship with
a woman where you fight all the time?

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:49.384
Even when you love 'em.

01:13:49.551 --> 01:13:54.514
It's like havin' two heads. One says
"red", the other's sure to say "green".

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:59.185
Once you had one that wasn't like that,
you never go back again. You leave it.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:02.230
You don't point a finger
and blame someone.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:05.024
You just go your separate ways.

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:06.985
OK?

01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:11.823
That's it.

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.242
Yeah, well, the apology still goes.

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:58.203
That's your ass, High Top!

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:01.956
Bloods don't deal with Crip dealers.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:07.045
You Crip!

01:15:12.217 --> 01:15:14.260
Hey, Crip!

01:15:15.804 --> 01:15:17.764
We're Bloods, motherfucker!

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:29.651
I want a doctor.

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:34.072
Why'd they do you, High Top? Hm?

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:36.950
You sellin' bad shit in the street?

01:15:37.075 --> 01:15:40.120
You been hangin' around
those Crips too much, man.

01:15:41.121 --> 01:15:43.415
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.334
Lawyer's not gonna help you, man.

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:49.963
Give it up.
Tell me somethin' that I don't know.

01:15:50.922 --> 01:15:54.217
Even his homeboys can't deal with him.
Get his ass outta here.

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:56.428
- Get him put in his cell.
- Hold it!

01:16:00.682 --> 01:16:04.894
Wanna get out of the gang module, huh?
Wanna get back in the population?

01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:08.523
You don't... well,
you're one dead motherfucker.

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:11.359
Tell me somethin' I don't know.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.906
You may beat the rap, but there's
all kinds of justice in this world.

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:18.867
I don't know what you know.

01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:22.412
Give me somethin' tasty.

01:16:22.537 --> 01:16:26.040
Some of that nasty cheese of yours, hm?

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:32.714
It's a cold world, Blood. No mercy.

01:16:32.839 --> 01:16:36.176
Ain't that what you write on the walls?

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:41.306
Who got Robert Craig?

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:49.689
Rocket. It was Rocket.

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:57.113
Hollenbeck units. Vehicle used in a 187.

01:16:57.238 --> 01:17:03.578
Dark-blue van. License.1-Frank-
9-2-6-David. 1-Frank-9-2-6-David.

01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:06.956
- That's Rocket's van, man.
- Well, here we go.

01:17:07.082 --> 01:17:12.587
1-CRASH-32, we're southbound
on Huntington, responding to a 187 van.

01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:15.256
At the liquor store,
you go past it, turn right.

01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:20.178
I have my light on a dark-blue
van behind the liquor store.

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:50.125
Driver, put both hands out the window.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.293
Both hands!

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:58.007
Keep your right hand out the window.
Take your left hand...

01:17:58.133 --> 01:18:01.386
cross it over your body
and take the keys out of the ignition.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:07.725
I wanna see the keys in your hand.

01:18:12.647 --> 01:18:17.026
Air Two. I have two units,
code six, on the suspect.

01:18:18.069 --> 01:18:20.989
Now, with one hand,
open the right-hand door.

01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:24.033
I want it all the way open.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:26.661
Same hand, open the other door.

01:18:30.582 --> 01:18:32.000
Now get your hand back up.

01:18:33.084 --> 01:18:36.463
Air Two. We have two suspects.
Male, black.

01:18:38.131 --> 01:18:39.841
Passenger...

01:18:39.966 --> 01:18:44.262
slowly climb over the driver's side.
Exit with your hands in the air.

01:18:48.433 --> 01:18:51.936
Put your hands in sight above your head.

01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:54.939
Face forward.

01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:06.493
Hey, RJ, these guys look pretty scary.
You feelin' like a hero? Cuff 'em up.

01:19:08.161 --> 01:19:12.373
This is the van that ol' Rocket was driving
when he shot up Robert Craig.

01:19:12.499 --> 01:19:15.585
- Read 'em their rights.
- What for?

01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:20.423
All right, keep your head still.

01:19:20.548 --> 01:19:24.552
OK, move 'em over. That's it.
What you got? Nice and easy now.

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:27.222
- See my flashlight?
- Tell me what you got.

01:19:27.347 --> 01:19:31.017
- OK, what do we got here?
- Don't want no surprises.

01:19:32.644 --> 01:19:34.395
Don't worry. They got no diseases.

01:19:37.065 --> 01:19:40.985
Air Two. Code four. Suspects in custody.

01:19:43.947 --> 01:19:46.491
How long have you known Rocket?

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:48.993
A year? Ten years?

01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:53.039
- About one year, I guess.
- About one year, you guess.

01:19:53.164 --> 01:19:55.417
Where does his lady live?

01:19:57.544 --> 01:19:58.962
I don't know.

01:19:59.963 --> 01:20:02.507
Hey, don't pull my fuckin' dick, stupid.

01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:05.927
I don't. I don't know where she lives.

01:20:06.928 --> 01:20:10.432
OK, look. Somebody
wants to kill Rocket, let's say.

01:20:10.557 --> 01:20:15.603
And old fat Willie's gotta let him know, be
a hero to him. Now, how do you find him?

01:20:16.354 --> 01:20:17.981
I don't know.

01:20:18.982 --> 01:20:21.025
Oh, man, homes.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.867
We can do this all fuckin' night.
What is Rocket's girlfriend's name?

01:20:29.951 --> 01:20:32.787
I don't know his girlfriend's name.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:37.375
Hey, look.

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:41.129
You're not talkin' to some fool now.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.591
We're talkin' about your freedom.

01:20:44.716 --> 01:20:47.677
You don't know her.
What's her girlfriend's name?

01:20:49.304 --> 01:20:52.515
- What girlfriend?
- Any one. Pick one.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.060
Don't tell me you don't know
the little bitches' names in the hood.

01:20:56.186 --> 01:20:58.229
Big strong boy like you.

01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:01.900
Huh?

01:21:03.234 --> 01:21:07.072
What's the name of some of
Rocket's girlfriend's friends?

01:21:08.698 --> 01:21:10.241
Annie.

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.410
Annie what?

01:21:12.911 --> 01:21:14.954
I don't know.

01:21:15.622 --> 01:21:18.374
180, 65. Come to the front desk.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:23.254
Who else? Don't pull my fuckin' dick.
I'll front you in front of the homeboys.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:27.133
I'll go out there, give you $50,
say "Thanks for the information."

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.385
I'll do it. I've done it before.

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:35.183
Cheryl Williams.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.105
I'll be back.
You keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

01:21:40.605 --> 01:21:42.273
Annie, Cheryl Williams.

01:21:42.524 --> 01:21:47.654
Call at the front desk. 1-David-12,
phone call at the front desk.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:54.619
How did he get your van?

01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:02.210
How did he get your van?

01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:06.089
Hm?

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:11.636
We know that he used your van, Lewis.
Now, if you don't wanna get in trouble...

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:14.055
just tell me how Rocket got it.

01:22:25.859 --> 01:22:27.986
I lent it to my brother.

01:22:28.153 --> 01:22:30.238
And?

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:32.407
Rocket took it from him at a party.

01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:35.076
He just took the van?

01:22:35.869 --> 01:22:38.329
My brother was afraid.

01:22:39.581 --> 01:22:42.250
He's more afraid of Rocket than of you?

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:51.217
Detective McShaney has a call
in the front office.

01:22:54.596 --> 01:22:59.017
Just so we understand ourselves.
We don't want you, man. We want him.

01:22:59.726 --> 01:23:02.979
But they used your van in a drive-by...

01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:06.149
so we're gonna book you
unless you help us out.

01:23:14.699 --> 01:23:16.993
Relax, man. I'm not laughin' at you.

01:23:17.952 --> 01:23:21.372
- You know what fat Willie just told me?
- What?

01:23:21.498 --> 01:23:26.086
You know that foxy little chick that hangs
out with Cheryl Williams and Annie?

01:23:26.211 --> 01:23:29.422
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, yeah, you know who I mean.

01:23:29.547 --> 01:23:32.008
The sexy little thing. This is wild.

01:23:32.509 --> 01:23:34.552
Shit, uh...

01:23:36.471 --> 01:23:39.307
Lewis, what the fuck
is the name of that girl?

01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:42.393
- Sharon?
- Right!

01:23:42.519 --> 01:23:44.646
Oh, yeah.

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.941
Right, Sharon, uh...

01:23:48.066 --> 01:23:49.526
I don't know.

01:23:50.527 --> 01:23:52.570
Robbins?

01:23:53.446 --> 01:23:55.990
Robbins. Right.

01:23:56.282 --> 01:23:58.993
- Rocket's lady.
- Right, man!

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:05.083
Right.

01:24:07.794 --> 01:24:10.065
Police! Open up.

01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:14.926
- I don't think they heard us.
- Fuck 'em. Let's go.

01:24:15.051 --> 01:24:17.178
Talk about gettin' off.

01:24:17.303 --> 01:24:20.473
We are going in.
Be careful and be quiet.

01:24:36.281 --> 01:24:37.916
Yes!

01:25:14.554 --> 01:25:15.945
Freeze!

01:25:20.533 --> 01:25:23.078
That's not Rocket. That's not Rocket.

01:25:27.409 --> 01:25:29.642
Holy fuck! Stop that shit.

01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:31.169
Come on.

01:25:36.758 --> 01:25:38.843
Killer-Bee.

01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:41.262
Why'd you move, man? Why?

01:25:41.387 --> 01:25:44.057
I was reachin'... for my pants, man.

01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:46.017
Yeah.

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:51.189
Just lie still. Don't move, OK? Hang
in there. I'll get you an ambulance, OK?

01:25:52.273 --> 01:25:54.818
Somebody get an ambulance!

01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:57.195
Hang in there.

01:26:04.702 --> 01:26:09.332
Motherfucker, you!
Pac-Man, motherfucker, you!

01:26:09.457 --> 01:26:12.585
We're gonna get you, motherfucker!

01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:20.593
We can get Pac-Man.

01:26:21.719 --> 01:26:24.180
- You get Pac-Man.
- We gonna let Rocket know.

01:26:24.305 --> 01:26:26.433
Sure enough, momma. We tell Rocket.

01:26:33.898 --> 01:26:36.192
Yo, Rocket, man! Check out this uzi.

01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:40.447
Definitely tighten up
Pac-Man's shit, homeboy.

01:26:52.751 --> 01:26:54.502
T-Bone.

01:26:54.627 --> 01:26:58.298
- You gonna shoot me, you punk?
- I'm not gonna shoot you.

01:26:58.423 --> 01:27:01.134
- You gonna shoot me?
- Everything's cool. Let's go.

01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:03.511
Fuck that, man!

01:27:03.636 --> 01:27:06.389
- Get off me! Gimme my rabbit.
- Calm down, T-Bone.

01:27:06.514 --> 01:27:08.683
Tell him to gimme my rabbit. Punk!

01:27:08.808 --> 01:27:11.352
You couldn't get none at home?
Get off me, man!

01:27:11.519 --> 01:27:14.064
- There's your rabbit, T-Bone.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:17.776
- There's your rabbit.
- I stuck my T-bones in your hind!

01:27:17.901 --> 01:27:20.695
- In the hind, baby.
- Get up, T-Bone.

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:25.241
- You don't have to stick my face in it.
- You'll get your rabbit. Got your rabbit.

01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:28.411
- Give it!
- Here's your rabbit. Come on.

01:27:28.536 --> 01:27:31.414
You're tryin' to take T-Bone away.
I want another one.

01:27:31.539 --> 01:27:34.584
You can't take T-Bone away, man.
You can't take the T!

01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:38.922
Here, boy, come on now. Come on.
The rabbit's gonna be right with us here.

01:27:39.047 --> 01:27:40.882
Here's your rabbit.

01:27:41.007 --> 01:27:43.468
See that? That's the part that's next.

01:27:59.609 --> 01:28:04.406
Hey, man. Wherever I go,
I represent the set, man. I am the set.

01:28:04.572 --> 01:28:08.868
Kickin' back, illin' with the homeboys.
Doin' that crazy shit.

01:28:08.993 --> 01:28:12.038
- Right on, T-Bone.
- I love that crazy shit.

01:28:12.163 --> 01:28:14.999
Crashin' motherfuckers on the floor.
Bam, man!

01:28:15.125 --> 01:28:17.335
Bust 'em in the head,
stab 'em, whatever.

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:20.630
- Robbin' houses, beatin' up on fools.
- You know that.

01:28:20.755 --> 01:28:24.509
- Blastin' my enemies.
- Go partyin' afterwards. That's it, man.

01:28:24.634 --> 01:28:28.388
Yo, I go to this freak house, man,
with cuz. I left cuz there.

01:28:28.555 --> 01:28:33.059
Man, I come back, the boy's sleepin'
on the floor, man. Like The Little Rascals.

01:28:33.184 --> 01:28:35.019
Boy's sleepin' on the floor.

01:28:35.145 --> 01:28:37.522
You know Rocket's hidin' out, man.

01:28:37.689 --> 01:28:41.192
Cops killed the Killer-Bee, man.
Shot that boy down, man!

01:28:41.359 --> 01:28:45.113
He's pumpin' his fuel into Rocket's lady.
The cops came in, bang, bang!

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.616
Pumped so much lead in that boy,
turned him into a pencil, man.

01:28:48.742 --> 01:28:52.787
Left him on the floor curled up
like a baby with a big dick, man.

01:28:52.912 --> 01:28:55.832
- That's cold, man.
- Word, that's the Pac-Man.

01:28:55.957 --> 01:29:00.044
That motherfucker Pac-Man,
we gonna put the bite on his ass, man.

01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:04.507
Yo, man, go get me some cigarettes.

01:29:04.632 --> 01:29:07.177
And a girlie magazine. Hurry up, man.

01:29:08.178 --> 01:29:11.014
Hey, come on, Frog.
Are you playin' or what?

01:29:25.361 --> 01:29:29.574
What about the woman, Officer Baines?
Was she in the line of fire?

01:29:29.699 --> 01:29:32.577
Not to my knowledge. She wasn't hit.

01:29:33.453 --> 01:29:38.124
Your knowledge of our shooting policy
is the question here, Officer Baines...

01:29:38.249 --> 01:29:41.252
because your judgment
is certainly suspect.

01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:44.756
You killed a man, mister...
for reachin' for his pants.

01:29:45.924 --> 01:29:50.261
Sir, I thought my life and the lives
of my fellow officers were in danger.

01:29:50.386 --> 01:29:55.350
- He appeared to be going for a weapon.
- I do understand that, Officer Baines.

01:29:55.475 --> 01:29:57.310
But what I can't figure out...

01:29:57.435 --> 01:30:01.106
is why you didn't take more time
to find out who was really in that room.

01:30:01.272 --> 01:30:04.859
Sir, we thought the 187
murder suspect was in the room.

01:30:04.984 --> 01:30:07.195
That's why we were there.

01:30:08.905 --> 01:30:11.783
You thought wrong, Officer Baines.

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:14.744
Man, this is crazy.

01:30:16.413 --> 01:30:18.415
They think he shot him.

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:21.251
- It wasn't you, was it?
- No, sir.

01:30:21.835 --> 01:30:25.130
What difference does it make?
If they think he did, he did it.

01:30:25.255 --> 01:30:27.465
They're not gonna shoot a cop.

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:31.010
- Who told you this?
- I'd rather not say.

01:30:31.636 --> 01:30:33.555
I'm not asking you to testify.

01:30:37.142 --> 01:30:39.477
I'm not gonna give up your source.

01:30:42.355 --> 01:30:45.191
Leo Lopez. Call him Frog.

01:30:45.316 --> 01:30:48.653
He's in County on a traffic warrant.
He owed me one, OK?

01:30:50.572 --> 01:30:54.576
- Look, I believe him.
- I'm sick of these dumb assholes.

01:30:55.118 --> 01:30:58.580
Call Metro. Put the clamps on
until we get 'em to call it off.

01:30:58.705 --> 01:31:01.958
- Melindez, you wanna set it up?
- Yeah. Sure.

01:31:02.083 --> 01:31:03.543
What we gonna do with him?

01:31:03.877 --> 01:31:07.380
Excuse me. If you wanna take me
off the street, that's your option.

01:31:07.505 --> 01:31:12.510
But we shouldn't let these gangbangers
dictate the way we operate. I'll be OK.

01:31:13.553 --> 01:31:15.597
What do you think?

01:31:18.141 --> 01:31:21.978
I'll call Metro when I get upstairs.
In the meantime, kick back.

01:31:22.145 --> 01:31:25.065
Relax, tú sabes? And be careful.

01:31:25.190 --> 01:31:27.233
Yes, sir. Thank you.

01:31:33.156 --> 01:31:35.200
I'm back after lunch.

01:31:57.889 --> 01:32:02.268
Fuck it, man! They're still out there, dude,
askin' about the hit on Pac-Man.

01:32:02.393 --> 01:32:04.854

01:32:10.276 --> 01:32:12.320
Bullshit, shit!

01:32:17.909 --> 01:32:20.620

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:49.774
Shit! Well,
he shouldn't have paid, homes.

01:32:49.899 --> 01:32:53.236
- It's just money, man.
- I know, but he shouldn't have paid.

01:32:53.361 --> 01:32:55.363
<i>Went up to Miss Mousie's door</i>

01:32:55.488 --> 01:32:57.115
Shut up, man!

01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.617
Gonna get a job and

01:32:59.784 --> 01:33:03.621

Come on, homie. Show us how!

01:33:58.802 --> 01:34:00.845
This is so strong, man.

01:34:03.389 --> 01:34:07.894
You wanna have some of this shit

01:34:09.479 --> 01:34:11.523
Yeah, back in a bit.

01:34:25.662 --> 01:34:27.705
Shit.

01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:32.669
Good shit, huh?

01:34:32.794 --> 01:34:36.214
I feel sorry for the bitch
I'll take home tonight, ese.

01:35:06.202 --> 01:35:11.541

01:35:35.732 --> 01:35:37.776
I'm OK. How you doin' tonight?

01:35:46.743 --> 01:35:49.037
Bet we got victims up there now.

01:36:09.015 --> 01:36:11.309
Turn the music off.

01:36:13.061 --> 01:36:15.271
Sit him down.

01:36:17.190 --> 01:36:19.025
- Did anybody get hit?
- No.

01:36:19.150 --> 01:36:20.819
- Anyone hurt?
- No.

01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:34.457
- What's with your homeboy, Spanky?
- Too many cervezas, homes.

01:36:35.333 --> 01:36:37.377
Go sit over here, man.

01:36:42.882 --> 01:36:44.926
What are you on, man?

01:36:45.718 --> 01:36:48.888
- Been smokin' some super kools?
- Go sit over there.

01:36:49.013 --> 01:36:51.391
See my finger? Follow my finger.

01:36:52.684 --> 01:36:54.728
This guy's dusted.

01:36:55.937 --> 01:36:58.606
Don't sneak up on me like that, man.

01:37:00.108 --> 01:37:02.777
Come on. Come on out.
Take a seat over here.

01:37:31.681 --> 01:37:33.725
What?

01:37:38.188 --> 01:37:40.815
What's the matter with you, Pac-Man?

01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.942
Huh?

01:37:43.068 --> 01:37:46.279
What's the matter with you, man? Hey.

01:37:46.404 --> 01:37:48.239
- Hey, Pac-Man!
- Hey.

01:37:48.364 --> 01:37:50.658
Hey, Pac-Man! Hey, man.

01:37:50.825 --> 01:37:52.660
Fuck you. I know him.

01:37:54.037 --> 01:37:57.957
Just relax. Relax, relax. She's gone.

01:38:00.585 --> 01:38:03.588
I was watchin' TV...

01:38:06.883 --> 01:38:10.011
- What's your name?
- Mary Castillo.

01:38:10.553 --> 01:38:12.847
Castillo?

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:16.893
You think you know who I am, Danny?
Huh? Do you?

01:38:17.018 --> 01:38:20.021
All you see is what you want,
and you only want things one way.

01:38:20.146 --> 01:38:22.148
Look at me, Danny!

01:38:22.899 --> 01:38:25.360
- Look at me!
- Go back up, Dennis.

01:38:26.152 --> 01:38:28.446
Look at me, Pac-Man!

01:38:29.364 --> 01:38:31.825
This is me too, man!

01:38:44.838 --> 01:38:46.881
Why?

01:38:48.258 --> 01:38:50.468
Why? Why?

01:38:56.766 --> 01:38:58.351
Oh, God!

01:39:08.528 --> 01:39:11.156
Why? Why?

01:39:11.281 --> 01:39:13.742
I don't know why, man.

01:39:17.996 --> 01:39:20.248
Did you see how many people
were in the car?

01:39:20.373 --> 01:39:22.208
I didn't see anything.

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.587
Why?

01:39:42.812 --> 01:39:44.856
I saw who it was, man.

01:39:45.648 --> 01:39:48.193
It was Rocket, Dog-Man and Shooter.

01:39:49.486 --> 01:39:52.405
- Rocket?
- Fuck the Crips, eh?

01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:54.574
They die.

01:39:56.451 --> 01:40:00.205
I want in. Won't take this shit no more.

01:40:00.371 --> 01:40:01.998
Es mi barrio.

01:40:02.123 --> 01:40:04.167
I want in.

01:40:04.292 --> 01:40:07.003
Get off the fuckin' porch, homes.

01:40:07.378 --> 01:40:09.839
Get off the fuckin' porch, homes.

01:40:18.598 --> 01:40:21.309
So you wanna let
the little fucker in, huh?

01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:24.396
I don't think he's tough enough, homes.

01:40:25.397 --> 01:40:27.941
I don't think he's got
enough heart, man.

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:18.158
That's two fights, homes. All right.

01:41:18.408 --> 01:41:20.452
All right!

01:41:43.892 --> 01:41:46.561
There's no turning back now, homes.

01:41:48.688 --> 01:41:50.732
You fucked up, homes.

01:41:51.441 --> 01:41:53.526
You joined the gang.

01:41:53.651 --> 01:41:55.570
Es mi barrio, homes.

01:41:55.695 --> 01:41:57.906
Mi barrio.

01:41:58.031 --> 01:42:00.075
You did good.

01:42:00.575 --> 01:42:02.619
You all right?

01:42:03.036 --> 01:42:04.204
Good.

01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:06.414
Way to go, homie!

01:42:58.591 --> 01:43:00.635
Bang. 2-1, homes.

01:43:52.687 --> 01:43:54.731
OK, loosen up!

01:43:57.067 --> 01:44:00.904
All right, I want all CRASH units
on full alert. Wear your vests.

01:44:01.029 --> 01:44:04.449
Use every precaution.
Arrest 'em on sight.

01:44:04.616 --> 01:44:07.952
These streets'll be quiet soon.
There'll be nobody to bust.

01:44:08.078 --> 01:44:10.121
All right, let's go to work!

01:45:12.142 --> 01:45:13.977
All right, just as we planned.

01:45:35.749 --> 01:45:37.792
Stupid fucks.

01:45:56.936 --> 01:45:58.980
Grenades!

01:47:40.665 --> 01:47:42.709
Fuckin' Looney Tunes, eh?

01:47:44.085 --> 01:47:46.129
He's fuckin' Rambo, ese.

01:47:47.756 --> 01:47:49.799
Rambo didn't die, homes.

01:47:52.427 --> 01:47:57.057
Fuck that, man.
Cos I'm a fuckin' Rambo, homes!

01:47:57.182 --> 01:48:00.351
See, I go, man. I'll go just like Larry.

01:48:00.477 --> 01:48:04.022
Fuck! Fucking vato psycho loco, homes.

01:48:13.198 --> 01:48:17.410
When I die, homes,
I wanna go just like that, man.

01:48:18.912 --> 01:48:20.747
Die?

01:48:22.957 --> 01:48:25.960
You ain't never gonna die, homes.

01:48:29.297 --> 01:48:31.341
Come here.

01:48:42.644 --> 01:48:44.979
When I die, homes...

01:48:45.105 --> 01:48:47.399
I'm gonna die like that.

01:48:47.524 --> 01:48:49.567
Con mi ruca, homes.

01:48:51.945 --> 01:48:54.239
Relax, homie.

01:48:54.364 --> 01:48:56.366
You did good.

01:48:56.491 --> 01:48:58.827
Te aventaste, homes.

01:48:59.494 --> 01:49:02.497
You got big balls, little brother.

01:49:15.885 --> 01:49:17.470
Police!

01:49:21.766 --> 01:49:25.061
- What do you want, eh?
- Stand up! Hands on top of your head!

01:49:25.186 --> 01:49:28.189
- Get your hands up now!
- Drop that shotgun!

01:49:28.314 --> 01:49:34.028
Air Two. I have 20 suspects with
automatic rifles, shotguns and handguns.

01:49:34.154 --> 01:49:37.532
I repeat. This is Air Two.
I have 20 suspects...

01:49:37.657 --> 01:49:40.994
with automatic rifles,
shotguns and handguns.

01:49:42.996 --> 01:49:45.206
Put your hands behind your head!

01:49:45.331 --> 01:49:48.168
Get down on your knees!
Down on your knees.

01:49:51.254 --> 01:49:53.298
Down on your knees!

01:49:55.091 --> 01:49:59.220
- Been lookin' for you, Frog.
- Are we gonna have a rapport, Hodges?

01:50:01.014 --> 01:50:02.640
- Who'd you tell?
- Huh?

01:50:02.766 --> 01:50:04.684
- Who'd you tell?
- Nobody.

01:50:04.809 --> 01:50:06.853
You're a fuckin' liar.

01:50:11.441 --> 01:50:14.110
I go and do a favour
for your lousy partner.

01:50:24.079 --> 01:50:27.290
Get that cigarette
out of your mouth. Get up!

01:50:28.083 --> 01:50:30.794
- This guy's got a gun.
- Gimme another set of cuffs.

01:50:30.919 --> 01:50:33.046
Get down. Get down! Get down.

01:50:36.132 --> 01:50:39.052
- Hey, turn the fuck around.
- No future in it, vato!

01:50:39.511 --> 01:50:41.137
Oh, shit!

01:50:44.766 --> 01:50:48.853
Air Two requesting
four additional units for shots fired.

01:50:48.978 --> 01:50:51.272
Oh, Gosh. Oh.

01:50:51.398 --> 01:50:55.485
- Officer down! Call an RA unit!
- Officer requesting backup.

01:50:55.610 --> 01:50:57.987
Four units. 20 suspects. Armed.

01:50:58.613 --> 01:51:00.990
Jesus fucking Christ, man!

01:51:04.577 --> 01:51:06.204
It's OK.

01:51:06.329 --> 01:51:09.124
It's just... I can't feel my legs.

01:51:09.249 --> 01:51:12.710
- OK. It's OK.
- I just wanna lay here for a minute.

01:51:12.836 --> 01:51:15.839
- Stay calm. Stay calm.
- Just call my wife.

01:51:15.964 --> 01:51:18.675
OK. Somebody get an ambulance!

01:51:19.426 --> 01:51:22.804
Have somebody call my wife
and tell her to come get me.

01:51:23.805 --> 01:51:26.182
Go get my w... Get my wife.

01:51:26.349 --> 01:51:28.977
OK. I just wanna rest my head a minute.

01:51:29.102 --> 01:51:32.230
I gotta catch my breath.
I'm gonna catch my breath.

01:51:32.355 --> 01:51:34.274
OK.

01:51:34.399 --> 01:51:37.777
I'm gonna catch my breath.
Gonna catch my breath.

01:51:39.237 --> 01:51:41.281
Catch my breath.

01:51:42.449 --> 01:51:47.245
OK. Now, after just a little rest I...
I'll be ready to roll in a minute.

01:51:51.215 --> 01:51:53.752
- My wife...
- Stay calm. Stay calm.

01:51:53.877 --> 01:51:55.712
OK.

01:51:57.547 --> 01:52:00.008
Gotta catch my breath.

01:52:06.056 --> 01:52:08.516
Breathe. Breathe.

01:52:09.225 --> 01:52:12.604
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

01:52:15.231 --> 01:52:17.692
Let me catch my breath. Where's my wife?

01:52:21.863 --> 01:52:25.700
OK, I'll be ready to roll
in a minute. OK.

01:52:25.867 --> 01:52:27.911
It's all right. Call my wife.

01:52:31.956 --> 01:52:36.044
- Catch my breath.
- Breathe. Breathe.

01:52:38.129 --> 01:52:39.756
Breathe.

01:52:39.881 --> 01:52:42.592
Bob, breathe. Breathe!

01:52:49.391 --> 01:52:52.477
Air Two. We have a possible 187.

01:53:05.657 --> 01:53:07.734
Air Two...

01:53:55.248 --> 01:53:58.668
So you know, I keep my backup
on my inside left ankle.

01:53:58.793 --> 01:54:02.297
If we ever get into any hostage situation,
I call you by my name...

01:54:02.464 --> 01:54:06.551
Hey, hey, you ain't got to worry
about no hostage situation, partner...

01:54:06.676 --> 01:54:12.474
cos now, see, you got yourself
a bad, black, kick-ass cop for a sidekick.

01:54:12.599 --> 01:54:15.435
What's this, man?
Looks like we got us a deal.

01:54:32.285 --> 01:54:34.329
They toss it?

01:54:37.957 --> 01:54:40.001
You're all fired up, man.

01:54:41.127 --> 01:54:45.799
- Let me tell you about workin' the ghetto.
- Hey, I grew up in this neighbourhood.

01:54:45.924 --> 01:54:49.219
I don't need no lecture from no white cop
about how to get on here.

01:54:49.344 --> 01:54:53.640
Hey, what you gettin' moody for? I grew
up here. I know what the fuck I'm doin'.

01:54:53.765 --> 01:54:55.809
Just shut up, all right? Listen.

01:55:02.982 --> 01:55:05.819
There were these two, uh, bulls...

01:55:06.945 --> 01:55:09.781
and they're standin'
on top of a mountain.
