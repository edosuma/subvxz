<i> Previously on</i> Hawaii Five-O:

00:03.504 --> 00:05.337
Goro Shioma was
my father's mentor.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.405
I offered to buy him out,
but he wouldn't accept.

00:07.407 --> 00:10.474
He said the only way out
was to leave with nothing.

00:10.476 --> 00:12.709
Delivery, Mr.
and Mrs. Noshimuri.

00:12.711 --> 00:14.361
Now all you
have to do

00:14.362 --> 00:16.012
is give my friend Damon here
the account codes.

00:16.014 --> 00:19.015
WOMAN:
The transfer's now complete.

00:19.017 --> 00:20.316
You had to give
Gabriel the money.

00:20.318 --> 00:23.319
If you hadn't,
we'd both be dead.

00:23.321 --> 00:26.655
We had two Yakuzas sitting
outside our house yesterday.

00:26.657 --> 00:27.656
ADAM:
<i> You know how Shioma operates.</i>

00:27.658 --> 00:29.158
<i> If he sent men to hurt us,</i>

00:29.159 --> 00:30.659
<i> we never would</i>
<i> have seen them, okay?</i>

00:30.661 --> 00:34.362
<i> He's just posturing,</i>
<i> trying to intimidate us.</i>

00:34.364 --> 00:36.263
Tom Bishop, I work
for Goro Shioma.

00:36.265 --> 00:38.798
Out of respect
to your late father,

00:38.800 --> 00:41.634
Mr. Shioma wants to resolve
this situation peacefully.

00:41.636 --> 00:43.802
This is Gabriel Waincroft's
most trusted soldier.

00:43.804 --> 00:46.371
If anyone knows Gabriel's
whereabouts, it's him.

00:46.373 --> 00:48.239
I find it hard to believe
you brought me here

00:48.241 --> 00:50.274
just to watch you beat
the information out of him.

00:50.276 --> 00:53.043
We're not going
to question him-- you are.

00:53.045 --> 00:55.245
He's telling the truth-- he
doesn't know where Gabriel is.

00:55.247 --> 00:57.146
Well, we tried, right?

00:59.383 --> 01:01.449
I'm afraid it's all
on you now.

01:01.451 --> 01:03.517
Mr. Shioma wants
what you owe him,

01:03.519 --> 01:07.186
and he wants it soon.

01:10.357 --> 01:11.789
(brush crunching)

01:11.791 --> 01:14.825
(heavy breathing)

01:14.827 --> 01:16.626
You don't have to do this.

01:16.628 --> 01:18.427
I just need more time.

01:18.429 --> 01:20.362
Mr. Shioma has given you
over a month

01:20.364 --> 01:23.398
to make good on your debt--
time's up.

01:24.467 --> 01:26.400
What about my wife?

01:26.402 --> 01:28.568
As far as I know, he has no
intention of hurting her.

01:28.570 --> 01:30.570
No, that's not good enough.

01:30.572 --> 01:32.471
I need some assurance.

01:32.473 --> 01:36.141
Goro Shioma
is not like your father.

01:36.143 --> 01:37.775
He's a man of honor.

01:37.777 --> 01:40.410
This debt is yours
and yours alone.

01:40.412 --> 01:44.514
Just let me call her, man.
To say goodbye.

01:44.516 --> 01:47.516
You know
I can't do that.

12:22.267 --> 12:24.300
That's pretty, pretty solid,

12:24.302 --> 12:26.302
That's a pretty solid performance.
Yeah, very good.

12:26.304 --> 12:28.103
What are you talking about?

12:28.105 --> 12:29.637
It says here,
"Albert Keating.

12:29.639 --> 12:32.873
"President, Sunset Investment,
Palm Springs.

12:32.875 --> 12:35.742
'You're never too old
to start saving.'"

12:35.744 --> 12:37.977
Maybe it's his twin brother.
You got a twin?

12:37.979 --> 12:40.779
Okay, all right, uh, all right.

12:40.781 --> 12:42.747
All right, all right,
you got me.

12:42.749 --> 12:43.814
You got me, okay?

12:43.816 --> 12:45.115
Full disclosure--
Katie and I?

12:45.117 --> 12:47.217
We came to Hawai'i
to work the tourists, you know?

12:47.219 --> 12:49.152
We wanted to leave Palm
Springs, fresh start.

12:49.154 --> 12:51.988
Simplify, change it
up a little bit.

12:51.990 --> 12:53.122
So we went with the Badger game.

12:53.124 --> 12:54.940
It's where you
target married men.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.757
And you catch them with
their pants down literally.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.359
They run out.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.827
We take their stuff.

12:59.829 --> 13:01.261
But this?
This is...

13:01.263 --> 13:04.130
this is crazy.

13:10.304 --> 13:11.870
Well, it's lucky you
weren't in the room, huh?

13:11.872 --> 13:15.907
If you think that I had anything
to do with his, you're wrong.

13:15.909 --> 13:17.308
I'm wrong?

13:17.310 --> 13:19.343
Okay, Katie was
more than a protégé to me.

13:19.345 --> 13:21.978
We...

13:21.980 --> 13:23.045
we had something.

13:23.047 --> 13:24.279
Okay, stop,
please, okay?

13:24.281 --> 13:26.714
Hank, you are
a con man, all right?

13:26.716 --> 13:28.782
Therefore, we do not buy
what you are selling.

13:28.784 --> 13:30.817
You understand? Save the
Steppenwolf for the tourist.

13:30.819 --> 13:32.118
Duke?

13:32.119 --> 13:33.418
Do me a favor--
take our friend here

13:33.421 --> 13:34.953
over to the Palace and make sure
he finds a seat in rendition.

13:34.955 --> 13:37.155
Put some handcuffs on him, too

13:37.157 --> 13:38.756
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
timeout, hold on.

13:38.758 --> 13:39.957
Am I... is-is this?
Am I under arrest?

13:39.959 --> 13:41.124
You're not under arrest,
not yet.

13:41.126 --> 13:42.959
I'm just want to make sure

13:42.961 --> 13:44.327
you don't steal my buddy's
wallet on the way out.

13:44.329 --> 13:45.861
Ow, ow. Nice and
tight, nice and tight.

13:45.863 --> 13:48.997
Let's go.

13:48.999 --> 13:51.099
What do you think?

13:51.101 --> 13:52.867
I think he probably
pissed off enough people

13:52.869 --> 13:53.968
and karma caught up with him.

13:53.970 --> 13:55.336
I just feel bad for the mark.

13:55.338 --> 13:57.404
Okay, yeah, but it doesn't
make any sense to me.

13:57.406 --> 14:00.740
Who kills somebody over a
wedding ring and some cash?

14:00.742 --> 14:02.108
Hey, what do we got?

14:02.110 --> 14:05.144
Um, so, Hank and Kate

14:05.146 --> 14:06.311
checked in the hotel
this morning

14:06.313 --> 14:09.447
under the names
Marshall and April Carter.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.981
Yeah, they paid
cash for the room

14:10.983 --> 14:12.449
and the reservation
was for one night only.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.217
But their return flight isn't
until the end of the week.

14:14.219 --> 14:16.352
Okay, they got to have
another room someplace else.

14:16.354 --> 14:17.920
Yeah, why would
they do that?

14:17.922 --> 14:19.755
To cover themselves.
Hank's not a moron.

14:19.757 --> 14:22.023
He's smart enough to know
you don't sleep where you steal.

14:22.025 --> 14:25.059
What, you read that
on a T-shirt or something?

14:25.061 --> 14:27.127
Oh, this guy can't read--
what are you talking about?

14:27.129 --> 14:28.695
Okay, Danny and I
are gonna try to find

14:28.697 --> 14:30.096
this other hotel room,
wherever it may be.

14:30.098 --> 14:31.997
You guys,
talk to security here, please.

14:31.999 --> 14:34.199
Okay, Hank said that Katie was
seducing married men in the bar.

14:34.201 --> 14:36.067
Okay, they got
to have CCTV in there.

14:36.069 --> 14:37.902
Let's try to I.D. those guys.

14:37.904 --> 14:39.370
One of them
could be our shooter.

14:39.372 --> 14:41.105
ADAM:
Hey, Kono, it's me.

14:41.107 --> 14:44.208
Call me as soon as you can.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.043
What's the matter?

14:46.045 --> 14:47.144
You all right?
Everything all right?

14:47.146 --> 14:48.211
Uh, I don't know.

14:48.213 --> 14:49.278
You go ahead.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.345
I-I'll be right there.

14:50.347 --> 14:53.147
Okay.

14:53.149 --> 14:55.215
(line ringing)

14:56.418 --> 14:57.917
ADAM:
Hey.

14:57.919 --> 15:00.119
Hi. Are you okay?
I got your message.

15:00.121 --> 15:01.386
I'm fine.

15:01.388 --> 15:02.920
No big deal.

15:02.922 --> 15:05.122
I was just wondering
if you knew when you'd be home.

15:05.124 --> 15:07.491
I thought we could go out,
grab dinner?

15:07.493 --> 15:09.793
Oh, that sounds like fun.

15:09.795 --> 15:12.128
Um, but I'm gonna be
working late.

15:12.130 --> 15:13.195
All right,
we'll play it by ear then.

15:13.197 --> 15:14.029
Okay.

15:14.031 --> 15:16.131
I love you.

15:16.133 --> 15:18.199
I love you, too.

15:36.084 --> 15:38.184
Charming place.

15:38.186 --> 15:40.186
McGarrett brought
the concept of rendition

15:40.188 --> 15:41.320
over from the military.

15:41.322 --> 15:44.189
Have a seat.
Okay.

15:44.191 --> 15:47.058
Our interrogation tactics,
however unorthodox,

15:47.060 --> 15:49.093
do yield immediate results.

15:49.095 --> 15:50.928
ABBY: Huh, where's the
interrogator sit?

15:50.930 --> 15:52.763
We don't.

15:52.765 --> 15:54.064
And that's
to our advantage.

15:54.066 --> 15:55.832
We sit, we get comfortable.

15:55.834 --> 15:58.000
Which means
they get comfortable.

15:58.002 --> 16:00.369
And we never want them
to get comfortable.

16:00.371 --> 16:02.137
Good, yeah.

16:02.139 --> 16:03.805
I've got a question.

16:03.807 --> 16:06.841
Um, what the hell
is this drain for?

16:06.843 --> 16:09.476
Use your imagination.

16:09.478 --> 16:11.778
Yeah, I'd rather not.

16:11.780 --> 16:14.113
Well, I'm impressed.

16:14.115 --> 16:15.481
Thank you.

16:15.483 --> 16:17.149
I can think of a few
cases where having

16:17.151 --> 16:18.283
a room like this
would've been helpful.

16:18.285 --> 16:20.151
Yeah.
(cell phone ringing)

16:20.153 --> 16:22.153
Excuse me.

16:22.155 --> 16:25.122
Lieutenant Kelly.

16:25.124 --> 16:27.090
I'll be right there.

16:27.092 --> 16:28.958
Well, looks like
we caught a new case.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.060
Come on, I could use a hand.

16:35.299 --> 16:37.098
When were they discovered?
About an hour ago.

16:37.100 --> 16:40.334
Ship's captain found the bodies,
called Port Authority.

16:40.336 --> 16:43.470
(indistinct radio transmission)

16:44.573 --> 16:47.173
CHIN:
This was an execution.

16:47.175 --> 16:48.841
They're all part
of the same crew.

16:48.843 --> 16:51.109
What do we know about
the ship they came in on?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.477
Arrived a couple hours ago.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.045
Originated from Shanghai.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.547
We checked the manifest--
four containers are missing.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.849
How'd they get past security?
They didn't.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.550
I got my guys checking
the port for them now.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.252
What kind of cargo
were they bringing in?

17:03.254 --> 17:04.386
According
to the captain,

17:04.388 --> 17:05.553
it was mostly kid's toys.

17:08.291 --> 17:10.090
This was a smuggling op.

17:10.092 --> 17:11.558
Shanghai to the mainland

17:11.560 --> 17:14.294
with inventory clearance
at a low volume port of entry.

17:14.296 --> 17:16.296
Mostly likely narcotics.

17:16.298 --> 17:18.965
Enough weight to justify
killing five men over.

17:19.968 --> 17:21.901
Now I'm impressed.

17:23.471 --> 17:25.437
(locks click)

17:27.607 --> 17:30.541
All right, where is it?

17:30.543 --> 17:33.911
Whoa, Starsky & Hutch,
it's a little vague.

17:33.913 --> 17:35.445
DANNY:
We just went

17:35.447 --> 17:37.847
to your other hotel room
and it's completely tossed.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.215
STEVE: All right, so whoever
killed your partner

17:39.217 --> 17:40.282
went there looking
for something.

17:40.284 --> 17:41.483
Probably what
you stole from them.

17:41.485 --> 17:43.318
DANNY:
So, what could be

17:43.320 --> 17:45.420
so valuable that you took
that's worth killing for?

17:45.422 --> 17:47.522
I don't know.
Okay, try again.

17:47.524 --> 17:48.956
No, I'm telling you

17:48.958 --> 17:50.490
I don't know.

17:50.492 --> 17:52.024
Uh, we-we just took wallets
off the guys from the hotel.

17:52.026 --> 17:52.924
We grabbed the cash.

17:52.926 --> 17:55.043
We tossed the rest.

17:55.044 --> 17:57.161
Could somebody please tell me
what the hell this drain is for?

17:57.163 --> 17:58.362
All right, listen to me.

17:58.364 --> 18:01.164
The two married guys
that you scammed?

18:01.166 --> 18:02.865
They alibied out, okay?

18:02.867 --> 18:05.534
Which means you took
more stuff from more people.

18:05.536 --> 18:08.336
So, you either gonna
tell us about that,

18:08.338 --> 18:10.004
or I'm gonna show you
what that drain's for.

18:10.006 --> 18:13.007
Okay. (chuckles)

18:13.009 --> 18:15.943
Okay, uh, maybe we took
a few small items

18:15.945 --> 18:18.378
from the airport when we landed.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.646
Just a few? Fine,
maybe more than a few,

18:20.648 --> 18:22.097
but it was just normal stuff.

18:22.098 --> 18:23.547
It was luggage,
cell phones, watches.

18:23.550 --> 18:25.416
Normal stuff-- nothing worth
killing a person over.

18:25.418 --> 18:26.984
Okay, well, clearly the person
who killed your partner

18:26.986 --> 18:29.553
felt differently about that.

18:29.555 --> 18:32.522
Yeah, well, you know,

18:32.524 --> 18:33.990
whatever it is they
were looking for,

18:33.992 --> 18:35.524
they're not gonna find it.

18:35.526 --> 18:36.892
Why's that?

18:36.893 --> 18:38.259
Because Katie
pawned everything

18:38.262 --> 18:39.361
right after the score.

18:39.363 --> 18:40.662
So, whatever
they're looking for,

18:40.664 --> 18:42.330
it's gone.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.065
Okay.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.399
I want the name
of the pawn shop.

18:46.401 --> 18:48.100
Yeah, I don't know that.

18:48.102 --> 18:49.401
It was Katie's contact.

18:49.403 --> 18:51.569
You know, I let
her sell the merch.

18:51.571 --> 18:53.387
It's kind of like
honor among thieves.

18:53.388 --> 18:55.204
Okay, you realize whoever
bought all that merchandise

18:55.207 --> 18:56.439
could be the next target,
right?

18:56.441 --> 18:58.140
I mean, the shooter's

18:58.142 --> 19:00.509
not gonna stop until he finds
what he's looking for.

19:08.685 --> 19:11.519
All right, what are you doing?

19:11.521 --> 19:15.022
I'm undoing
this man's cuffs, Danny.

19:15.024 --> 19:16.490
I see that.
Why are you doing that?

19:16.492 --> 19:18.425
Because we need him.
Ha!

19:18.427 --> 19:20.193
You need me.

19:20.195 --> 19:21.561
Oh, God help us.

19:34.041 --> 19:35.340
Wow, this is a nice office.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.892
This is...
Pretty windows.

19:36.893 --> 19:38.443
Yeah, listen to me-- keep your
hands where I can see them.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.610
You steal anything,

19:39.612 --> 19:41.612
I'm gonna shoot you.
Yeah, I will not.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.180
Uh, you know, I don't,
I don't know-- sorry.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.415
I don't know the laws
here on the islands.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.116
But isn't that a little
extreme for larceny?

19:47.118 --> 19:48.150
Oh, that's funny.
You think I'm kidding.

19:48.152 --> 19:49.484
No, sir.

19:49.486 --> 19:51.352
In fact, I think
that happy-go-lucky

19:51.354 --> 19:53.254
got beaten into submission

19:53.255 --> 19:55.155
by ornery and forceful while
you were still in the womb.

19:55.157 --> 19:56.990
(snickering)

19:56.992 --> 19:58.842
Yeah?

19:58.843 --> 20:00.693
Where are we with the trace
on the pawn shop, Kono?

20:00.695 --> 20:02.261
All right, I pinged
Katie's cell phone.

20:02.263 --> 20:04.963
And it registered at two
cell towers this morning.

20:04.965 --> 20:06.230
One in Waikiki
near their hotel.

20:06.232 --> 20:07.397
The other one
in Chinatown,

20:07.399 --> 20:09.298
about a half-hour
after they checked in.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.199
Problem is there's about
a dozen pawn shops in that area.

20:11.201 --> 20:13.000
It's gonna take a minute
before we can figure out

20:13.002 --> 20:15.302
which one she went into.

20:15.303 --> 20:17.603
Well, why don't you just track
the GPS from the rental car?

20:17.606 --> 20:18.855
What rental car?

20:18.856 --> 20:20.105
The one we boosted
from the airport.

20:20.108 --> 20:22.108
Didn't I--?
Did I mention that?

20:22.110 --> 20:24.176
No, you didn't
mention that, Hank.

20:24.178 --> 20:25.443
Oh.
Where is it?

20:25.445 --> 20:28.212
It's valeted at the hotel
where we were,

20:28.214 --> 20:31.148
we were conducting
our business.

20:31.150 --> 20:33.583
KONO: Okay, I'll head over,
check the car's GPS.

20:33.585 --> 20:35.451
See if I can get us
an address of the pawn shop.

20:35.453 --> 20:36.585
Thank you.
Okay.

20:36.587 --> 20:39.354
Um, can I can get
a cup of coffee?

20:39.356 --> 20:41.689
I'm having a little trouble
adjusting to the time change.

20:41.691 --> 20:44.258
STEVE: All right, we need to pull
the manifest from Hank's flight.

20:44.260 --> 20:45.709
And every other flight

20:45.710 --> 20:47.159
that landed in Honolulu
around the same time.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.294
You, you're gonna
pick out all the people

20:48.296 --> 20:49.628
that you and Katie stole from.

20:49.630 --> 20:51.029
One of them could be
our shooter.

20:51.031 --> 20:52.130
Okay, but I'm just
telling you,

20:52.132 --> 20:53.998
I'm useless
without caffeine.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.165
GROVER:
How do you take it?

20:55.167 --> 20:57.167
Black? Couple cubes
of shut the hell up?

20:57.169 --> 20:59.202
(laughs)
Yeah.

20:59.204 --> 21:00.469
Two, two cubes
and then some cream.

21:00.471 --> 21:02.137
That be awesome.

21:02.139 --> 21:04.239
And then, of course,
your wallet.

21:04.241 --> 21:07.041
Sorry, you-you're
probably gonna want that.

21:07.043 --> 21:08.626
I took it.
Oh, hell no.

21:08.627 --> 21:10.210
You know what, you can get
your own damn coffee.

21:10.212 --> 21:11.294
What did I tell you?

21:11.295 --> 21:12.377
What did I tell you, huh?
I know, it's...

21:12.380 --> 21:13.545
Put your hands on the desk.

21:13.547 --> 21:15.079
It's a--
Keep them there.

21:15.081 --> 21:16.080
I can't help myself.

21:16.082 --> 21:17.281
Close your mouth.

21:24.222 --> 21:26.287
(indistinct chatter)

21:29.125 --> 21:32.192
♪ ♪

22:00.154 --> 22:02.220
(speaking Japanese)

22:07.493 --> 22:09.559
(speaking Japanese)

22:24.742 --> 22:26.742
GABRIEL:
By me.

22:37.855 --> 22:39.588
Heard you had a rough morning.

22:44.227 --> 22:45.693
You don't want
to talk about it?

22:45.695 --> 22:47.361
That's fine with me.

22:47.363 --> 22:49.863
You could at least
say thank you.

22:49.865 --> 22:52.832
We both know you
didn't do this for me.

22:52.834 --> 22:55.467
I'm a businessman.

22:55.469 --> 22:57.401
I don't want a war.

23:00.639 --> 23:02.639
This man has no honor.

23:02.641 --> 23:05.742
He attacked my wife,
stole my money,

23:05.744 --> 23:09.278
executed two of your men.

23:09.280 --> 23:13.115
Goro, we wouldn't be here
if he hadn't intervened.

23:13.117 --> 23:16.351
He's made amends for that.

23:17.454 --> 23:19.387
(scoffs)

23:21.290 --> 23:23.823
How much did he pay you
on top of the debt?

23:25.326 --> 23:26.858
Enough.

23:29.596 --> 23:33.464
And still you sent
your men to kill me.

23:33.466 --> 23:35.599
GABRIEL: Actually,
that was on me.

23:35.601 --> 23:38.435
I had some other business
to conduct this morning.

23:38.437 --> 23:41.271
Otherwise, I would have made
the deal with Goro sooner.

23:41.273 --> 23:43.773
And you wouldn't have had
to kill those two men.

23:49.346 --> 23:51.813
SHIOMA:
Our business is concluded.

23:51.815 --> 23:53.748
You are free to go.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.583
I killed two men...

23:58.720 --> 24:00.653
...for nothing?

24:26.247 --> 24:27.713
HANK:
Uh, him.

24:27.715 --> 24:29.781
Not her, not him.

24:29.783 --> 24:33.383
Her, that woman who looks
like she was born to knit.

24:35.220 --> 24:36.219
That kid.

24:36.221 --> 24:37.653
The kid?

24:37.655 --> 24:39.321
Yeah, I took a pair
of Beats off him.

24:39.323 --> 24:40.622
Look, Richie Rich was
sitting in first class.

24:40.624 --> 24:42.390
Did you ever fly first
class when you were a kid?

24:42.392 --> 24:43.691
Yeah, no.

24:43.693 --> 24:45.826
I mean, I guarantee you
that his parents

24:45.828 --> 24:47.194
are gonna buy him
a brand-new set of headphones

24:47.196 --> 24:48.445
as soon as they get
to the hotel.

24:48.446 --> 24:49.695
GROVER: That's the last
of the passengers.

24:49.698 --> 24:50.763
That's everybody.

24:52.433 --> 24:53.698
DANNY: All right,
got 12 potential suspects,

24:53.700 --> 24:55.666
not including the kid.

24:55.668 --> 24:58.735
All right, let's, uh, let's put
TSA alerts out on all of them.

24:58.737 --> 25:00.403
I don't want anybody
leaving the island

25:00.405 --> 25:01.704
until we have a chance
to talk to them.

25:01.706 --> 25:03.706
(cell phone rings)

25:03.708 --> 25:06.575
Yeah, Kono, you locate
that rental car?

25:06.577 --> 25:09.277
KONO: I did, and I was able
to get an address off the GPS.

25:09.279 --> 25:11.712
Tracked back to Waiwai Nui
Pawn Shop in Chinatown.

25:11.714 --> 25:12.713
Okay, great.

25:12.715 --> 25:14.247
Send it through to me, okay?

25:14.249 --> 25:15.815
Good work.

25:15.817 --> 25:17.817
You, you're coming with us--
you're gonna pick out

25:17.819 --> 25:19.218
all the items you stole.
Let's go.

25:25.926 --> 25:27.458
Hello?

25:27.460 --> 25:30.761
Five-O, anybody here?

25:37.802 --> 25:40.435
Looks like, uh...
somebody likes cats.

25:40.437 --> 25:41.436
(baby voice):
Who doesn't?

25:41.438 --> 25:42.770
Huh? Who doesn't?

25:42.772 --> 25:43.837
Hey. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

25:43.839 --> 25:44.904
Put the cat down.

25:48.542 --> 25:50.675
STEVE:
Hey, back door's open.

25:59.618 --> 26:02.752
STEVE: Looks like he's got
an apartment upstairs.

26:02.754 --> 26:04.620
Door's been forced open.

26:04.622 --> 26:07.456
Either of you guys
read Stephen King?

26:07.458 --> 26:09.791
I mean, I-I don't think
we should go up these stairs.

26:09.793 --> 26:11.359
Keep your voice down
and stay close.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.960
HANK: No, I'm good, I'm
gonna stay right here.

26:12.962 --> 26:15.028
Let's go, please.

26:19.000 --> 26:19.999
STEVE:
Five-O!

26:20.001 --> 26:21.266
After you.

26:33.913 --> 26:34.912
DANNY:
Clear.

26:34.914 --> 26:37.314
I got blood.

26:43.421 --> 26:44.853
Ugh.

26:46.790 --> 26:48.756
Is he dead?

26:48.758 --> 26:51.358
No, Hank, he's, uh,
he's just taking a nap.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.727
We're gonna defrost him though,
just to double-check, you know?

26:53.729 --> 26:57.931
That's... Is that... That's...
Is that... Are you joking?

27:14.782 --> 27:16.782
Hey.

27:16.784 --> 27:17.916
All right, so Max
said the C.O.D.

27:17.918 --> 27:19.918
was a single gunshot
wound to the chest.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.453
Uh, CSU found, uh, a shell
casing-- .22 caliber.

27:22.455 --> 27:24.087
Same as our other vics.

27:24.089 --> 27:25.354
How about time of death?

27:25.356 --> 27:26.688
We're not sure.

27:26.690 --> 27:27.822
The fridge was turned
all the way up.

27:27.824 --> 27:29.456
It affected
the body temp.

27:29.458 --> 27:31.458
Max is gonna get back
to us after the autopsy.

27:31.460 --> 27:35.462
All right, so shooter
takes out Katie and her mark,

27:35.464 --> 27:36.796
doesn't find what
he's looking for,

27:36.798 --> 27:38.798
goes over to Hank's
other hotel room.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.466
Uh, strikes out
there as well.

27:40.468 --> 27:42.000
Right. Somehow,
he figures out

27:42.002 --> 27:44.502
that all roads led
to the pawnshop.

27:44.504 --> 27:46.637
HANK:
Oh, this piece here.

27:46.639 --> 27:48.672
We swiped using
"oops, sorry" routine.

27:48.674 --> 27:51.608
The execution-- flawless.

27:52.577 --> 27:54.510
People work hard
for this stuff.

27:54.512 --> 27:56.545
And you just take it?

27:56.547 --> 27:58.647
Don't you feel the least
bit guilty about it?

27:58.649 --> 28:00.615
Aw, that's sweet.

28:00.617 --> 28:01.816
Don't go changing.

28:02.852 --> 28:04.718
Hey.
Hey.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.170
Everything accounted for?

28:07.171 --> 28:09.621
Uh, well, I remember swiping a
digital camera that is not here.

28:09.624 --> 28:12.458
Okay, maybe that's
what our shooter was after.

28:12.460 --> 28:14.660
Would you recognize the guy
you took that camera from?

28:14.662 --> 28:15.794
Yeah, sure, we did
the "bump and grab."

28:15.796 --> 28:17.095
I looked him right
in the eyeballs.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.395
But I'm gonna tell
you something.

28:18.398 --> 28:19.864
It wasn't one of those fancy
top-of-the-line cameras.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.732
Just a little, like,
cheap-o 20-meg deal.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.633
Not worth more than
maybe a hundred bucks.

28:23.635 --> 28:24.767
It's not the camera
they were looking for,

28:24.769 --> 28:25.768
it's what's on it.
Hey, Lou.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.102
You, uh, you get anywhere

28:27.104 --> 28:28.636
with the passengers
Hank picked out?

28:28.638 --> 28:30.804
We cleared 11 of
the 12 suspects.

28:30.806 --> 28:33.640
Nine of them had solid alibis
at the time of the murder.

28:33.642 --> 28:34.941
The other two were
on connecting flights

28:34.943 --> 28:36.642
to other islands
at the time.

28:36.644 --> 28:38.644
Which leaves only one guy
we haven't been able to reach.

28:38.646 --> 28:40.646
His name is
Andy Kaelani.

28:40.648 --> 28:41.647
He's<i> kama'aina.</i>

28:41.649 --> 28:42.814
Lives over in
Pearl City.

28:42.816 --> 28:44.816
He's got an assault
charge stemming

28:44.818 --> 28:46.751
from an incident
earlier this year.

28:46.752 --> 28:48.685
Well, he's got a violent side--
he could be our shooter.

28:48.688 --> 28:50.821
Send me through the picture--
I'll show it to Hank.

28:50.823 --> 28:52.756
All right, sent it
your way, boss.

28:52.758 --> 28:54.124
Thanks.

28:54.126 --> 28:57.694
Is that the guy you grabbed
the camera from?

28:57.696 --> 29:00.396
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

29:00.398 --> 29:02.730
All right.

29:05.835 --> 29:07.668
Looks like we got
two sets of tire tracks.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.670
A deal went down here.

29:09.672 --> 29:11.772
LUKELA: I.D.s just came in
on our dead crew members.

29:11.774 --> 29:14.974
Turns out, they all had
red notices on Interpol.

29:16.610 --> 29:18.576
CHIN:
Ex-Chinese military.

29:18.578 --> 29:22.579
All wanted in connection
to illicit arms dealing.

29:24.883 --> 29:26.883
Four containers
at 48 feet.

29:26.885 --> 29:28.751
That's a hell of a lot of guns.
Yeah.

29:28.753 --> 29:30.753
Anyone going after
that much firepower

29:30.755 --> 29:34.189
is either gonna sell it...
or looking to start a war.

29:34.191 --> 29:37.192
Thanks, Duke.

29:37.194 --> 29:39.594
HANK: When you really
think about it, Commander,

29:39.596 --> 29:41.095
you pulled the perfect
"velociraptor con"

29:41.097 --> 29:42.930
on Detective Williams.

29:42.932 --> 29:44.932
I mean, you took his car before
he even knew it was happening.

29:44.934 --> 29:46.700
Furthermore,
you're not giving it back.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.702
Which, according to the
laws of this great country,

29:48.704 --> 29:50.870
is technically stealing.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.105
Detective Williams drives his
car home every night, okay?

29:53.107 --> 29:55.107
You know, buddy, if I've
offended you in any way,

29:55.109 --> 29:56.908
I take it all back--
you're good with me.

29:56.910 --> 29:58.393
We're good?
Yeah.

29:58.394 --> 29:59.877
Yeah? You want to bro it up?
No, I don't want...

29:59.879 --> 30:01.945
That's-that's too much?
A little bit.

30:11.055 --> 30:12.621
(clears throat)

30:12.623 --> 30:14.589
Okay, you-- stay.
You don't move.

30:14.591 --> 30:16.591
(stammers)
That is fine by me.

30:16.593 --> 30:18.593
After seeing the pawnshop guy
stuffed in the 'frigerator,

30:18.595 --> 30:19.860
I'm happy to stay right here.

30:19.862 --> 30:21.795
Shut up, okay? Don't move.

30:39.981 --> 30:42.047
STEVE:
Five-O!

30:47.920 --> 30:49.519
Clear.

30:55.526 --> 30:56.992
Clear.

30:56.994 --> 30:57.993
(gun fires)

30:57.995 --> 30:59.060
DANNY:
Gun!

31:05.133 --> 31:06.966
STEVE:
Hank, Hank.

31:06.968 --> 31:08.033
Hank.

31:11.204 --> 31:12.870
Give me the gun, Hank.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.538
Give me the gun.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.974
What the hell
happened?

31:17.976 --> 31:20.843
He came out of there,
he had a gun in his hand,

31:20.845 --> 31:23.245
he was heading for the house,
I had to do something.

31:23.247 --> 31:24.913
I tackled him,
the gun went off.

31:24.915 --> 31:27.815
(breathing heavily)

31:27.817 --> 31:29.883
Okay, take it easy.

31:32.687 --> 31:34.219
I think you just saved
our lives, Hank.

31:35.922 --> 31:37.988
I guess you guys are
rubbing off on me, huh?

31:51.168 --> 31:53.034
Kaelani's gun was a .22.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.769
Same as the
other shooters.

31:54.771 --> 31:57.171
DANNY:
You all right?

31:57.173 --> 31:59.239
Uh, no.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.813
It took a lot of courage to
do what you did, Hank.

32:07.815 --> 32:09.281
I mean, if this guy
had got a shot off,

32:09.283 --> 32:10.815
it would have been one of us

32:10.817 --> 32:12.216
they'd be taking
pictures of right now.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.152
Thank you.

32:16.154 --> 32:18.287
Also, we found
this inside.

32:20.090 --> 32:22.090
That's the camera.

32:22.092 --> 32:24.192
All right, let's go
see what's on it.

32:28.965 --> 32:30.965
What?

32:30.967 --> 32:32.132
Okay, this doesn't
make any sense.

32:32.134 --> 32:33.884
They're all vacation pics.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.635
None of them are even
remotely suspicious.

32:35.637 --> 32:37.103
Why go through all that trouble
to get 'em back?

32:37.105 --> 32:39.872
Because he's not after
the photos.

32:41.141 --> 32:43.141
Wait a minute.

32:43.143 --> 32:44.675
Lou's right.

32:44.677 --> 32:46.576
There's got to be something
embedded on this.

32:46.578 --> 32:47.977
That would explain a lot.

32:47.979 --> 32:49.979
I'll get it to Jerry.

32:49.981 --> 32:52.982
So... what now?

32:52.984 --> 32:56.051
Well, ballistics were a match on
the .22 that Kaelani had on him,

32:56.053 --> 32:58.119
so as far as we're concerned,
we got our shooter, right?

32:58.121 --> 33:01.889
So that just leaves me.

33:01.891 --> 33:03.107
STEVE:
I guess so.

33:03.108 --> 33:04.324
Given your cooperation
in this murder investigation,

33:04.326 --> 33:05.892
and your heroics,

33:05.894 --> 33:07.193
we'll talk to
the P.A.'s office,

33:07.195 --> 33:08.327
get your charges reduced.

33:08.329 --> 33:09.594
You'll do
a couple of months, tops.

33:09.596 --> 33:10.828
(scoffs)

33:10.830 --> 33:13.664
A couple of months? Really?

33:13.666 --> 33:15.065
I thought you guys had juice.

33:15.067 --> 33:16.766
DANNY: No, no, no,
he's right.

33:16.768 --> 33:19.168
Let's, uh, let's skip calling
the P.A.'s office.

33:19.170 --> 33:22.871
He could probably use the solid
full rehabilitation time.

33:22.873 --> 33:25.106
That's good idea.
No, no, no, no. (chuckles)

33:25.108 --> 33:26.707
We're good. I'm good, yeah.

33:26.709 --> 33:28.042
So I appreciate that
and thank you,

33:28.043 --> 33:29.376
and I'm glad that I was able
to help you guys out.

33:29.378 --> 33:30.844
And if there's anything
you need in the future,

33:30.846 --> 33:31.945
you don't hesitate to ask.

33:31.947 --> 33:33.980
You know where I'll be.
I got one.

33:33.981 --> 33:36.014
Maybe you try a different
profession when you get out.

33:36.017 --> 33:38.317
(laughs) You mean like
a-a real job?

33:38.319 --> 33:40.052
(chuckles)
Yeah, no.

33:40.054 --> 33:42.087
How about I just wait until
I'm out of your jurisdiction?

33:42.089 --> 33:44.756
I'm kidding, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.

33:44.758 --> 33:46.357
Okay, look, why don't you take
Hank back to his hotel,

33:46.359 --> 33:48.258
get his things, take him
over to HPD for processing.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.026
Be my pleasure.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.161
Hey, you're not,
you're not still mad at me

33:52.163 --> 33:53.962
about stealing your wallet,
are you?

33:53.964 --> 33:54.996
What do you think?

33:54.998 --> 33:56.831
'Cause, uh,

33:56.833 --> 33:58.332
you're gonna hate me now.

33:58.334 --> 33:59.900
(laughing):
I did it again.

33:59.902 --> 34:01.334
GROVER:
That's funny.

34:01.336 --> 34:04.003
Maybe we'll stop at
the hospital on the way.

34:04.005 --> 34:05.404
Okay, well, good-bye, fellas.

34:05.406 --> 34:07.072
It's been a slice.

34:07.074 --> 34:09.074
STEVE:
Bye, Hank.

34:11.078 --> 34:13.044
I'm good.
I'm good.

34:13.046 --> 34:14.678
You know, I never thought
I'd meet anybody

34:14.680 --> 34:16.046
more frustrating than you.

34:16.048 --> 34:17.881
Oh, that's nice. You just
compared me to Hank?

34:17.883 --> 34:20.917
On irritation level, yes,
you two are very similar.

34:20.919 --> 34:22.084
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

34:22.086 --> 34:23.985
Where you going?

34:23.987 --> 34:25.453
I'm going to get coffee
wit somebody.

34:25.454 --> 34:26.920
Is that all right? Who you
going to get coffee with?

34:26.923 --> 34:28.355
None of your business.
How's it your business?

34:28.357 --> 34:30.724
Is it that girl you hung out
with last week?

34:30.726 --> 34:32.258
(phone rings)
What did I just say to you?

34:32.260 --> 34:33.993
Is that her right now?
'Cause if it is,

34:33.995 --> 34:35.294
let me talk to her.
I'll set her straight.

34:35.296 --> 34:36.895
No, no, you won't talk to her.

34:36.897 --> 34:38.196
You're never even gonna
meet her. It's Max, by the way.

34:38.198 --> 34:39.363
Oh.

34:39.365 --> 34:42.132
Max.

34:42.134 --> 34:43.333
Hold on, what?

34:48.172 --> 34:51.173
You sure about that?

34:51.175 --> 34:54.709
Okay, thanks.

34:54.711 --> 34:56.177
What?

34:56.179 --> 34:59.380
Max just said
the pawn shop owner died

34:59.382 --> 35:01.949
four hours before Katie Dawson.

35:02.885 --> 35:04.317
Doesn't make sense.

35:04.319 --> 35:05.818
If Kaelani already
had the camera,

35:05.820 --> 35:08.086
why would he go back
and kill Katie?

35:10.023 --> 35:11.856
He didn't.

35:11.858 --> 35:13.123
He didn't.

35:13.125 --> 35:14.791
We've been played.

35:16.127 --> 35:17.326
(buzzer blaring)

35:17.328 --> 35:18.727
Guys,

35:18.729 --> 35:20.395
look, look, I know
I pissed Lou off,

35:20.397 --> 35:21.696
but to have him

35:21.698 --> 35:22.797
bring me back here?

35:22.799 --> 35:24.031
This-this is just cruel.

35:24.033 --> 35:25.198
Cruel?

35:25.200 --> 35:28.034
Well, kind of like shooting
your partner.

35:28.036 --> 35:29.902
(chuckles)
Excuse me?

35:29.904 --> 35:31.703
That-That's cruel.

35:32.205 --> 35:33.621
You tried to scam us.

35:33.622 --> 35:35.038
You went for the long con,
and you were this close

35:35.041 --> 35:36.206
to making it work.

35:40.345 --> 35:42.345
This right here,

35:42.347 --> 35:45.147
this is what
it was all about, right?

35:45.149 --> 35:47.816
Uploading this memory card

35:47.818 --> 35:50.185
onto our system.

35:50.187 --> 35:52.954
You see, this is a virus,
isn't it, Hank?

35:52.956 --> 35:56.123
And this virus allows you
to spy on our mainframe.

35:56.125 --> 35:58.225
Oh, man.

35:58.227 --> 35:59.392
I love you two like brothers.

35:59.394 --> 36:01.026
I really do.

36:01.028 --> 36:03.261
So please don't be offended

36:03.263 --> 36:04.729
when I say this,

36:04.731 --> 36:07.031
but, uh, I think I need
to talk to my lawyer.

36:07.033 --> 36:08.899
Hank, you know how
it works down here.

36:08.901 --> 36:11.101
You don't get a lawyer
unless we say you get a lawyer.

36:11.103 --> 36:12.469
(scoffs)

36:12.471 --> 36:15.071
Detective Williams,
come on, buddy.

36:15.073 --> 36:16.806
Help me out here.
I mean, I don't know

36:16.808 --> 36:18.140
where he got these ideas from,
but he's wrong.

36:18.142 --> 36:20.976
No, I don't think he's wrong.

36:23.113 --> 36:25.279
Pawn shop owner's time of death
is what gave you away.

36:26.782 --> 36:28.882
The refrigerator
was a great idea.

36:28.884 --> 36:32.118
<i> You cool the body down,</i>
<i> you're gonna delay the TOD.</i>

36:32.120 --> 36:33.986
<i> You knew we were gonna</i>
<i> find out eventually.</i>

36:33.988 --> 36:36.355
See, you got sloppy, buddy.

36:36.357 --> 36:37.956
(chuckles)

36:37.958 --> 36:39.791
Everything else was brilliant.

36:39.793 --> 36:41.125
<i> Driving the rental car</i>
<i> to the pawn shop,</i>

36:41.127 --> 36:44.795
<i> make it look like</i>
<i> Katie drove there, perfect.</i>

36:44.797 --> 36:46.463
<i> We get to the hotel room,</i>

36:46.465 --> 36:49.199
<i> you made it look like somebody</i>
<i> beat us to it, fantastic.</i>

36:49.201 --> 36:51.167
<i> Then you went</i>
<i> and killed your partner.</i>

36:51.169 --> 36:52.234
Oh, my God!

36:55.339 --> 36:56.971
DANNY: It was good.

36:56.973 --> 36:58.238
I mean, the only thing left

36:58.240 --> 36:59.872
was to frame the shooter,
Kaelani.

36:59.874 --> 37:02.074
He was, he's
the perfect target, you know?

37:02.076 --> 37:04.209
Local guy,
works out of his garage,

37:04.211 --> 37:05.777
had a shady background.

37:05.779 --> 37:06.978
It was a perfect fit, right?

37:06.980 --> 37:09.080
<i> Somewhere in all this,</i>

37:09.082 --> 37:11.215
<i> you managed to get</i>
<i> over to his house,</i>

37:11.217 --> 37:12.249
<i> plant the gun and camera.</i>

37:15.220 --> 37:16.886
<i> Then when we got to his place,</i>
<i> you made sure</i>

37:16.888 --> 37:18.921
<i> we went inside while</i>
<i> you took care of the rest.</i>

37:25.428 --> 37:26.493
(gunshot)

37:32.233 --> 37:33.398
(whimpering)

37:33.400 --> 37:35.400
Hank, Hank.

37:36.436 --> 37:37.802
Whew.

37:37.804 --> 37:40.204
(clicks tongue)
You got it.

37:40.206 --> 37:41.639
(chuckles)
You got it.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.073
If my hands weren't cuffed,
I would applaud.

37:43.075 --> 37:45.542
I knew I liked you guys.

37:45.544 --> 37:48.144
And I got no room in my heart
for chumps, you know?

37:48.146 --> 37:51.313
But you two, you guys are smart.

37:51.315 --> 37:53.281
Well, here's the thing.

37:53.283 --> 37:55.349
You are not going to prison
for just a couple of months.

37:55.351 --> 37:57.084
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life there.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.919
I don't think so.

37:59.921 --> 38:01.487
All right, I want to know
who you were working for

38:01.489 --> 38:03.088
and why they wanted access
to our computers?

38:04.257 --> 38:07.491
I will do you one better,
Commander.

38:07.493 --> 38:09.226
I will testify against them,

38:09.228 --> 38:11.228
and I will help you
put them away

38:11.230 --> 38:12.596
for immunity.

38:14.833 --> 38:17.233
Who is it, Hank?

38:21.305 --> 38:23.605
Gabriel Waincroft.

38:31.314 --> 38:33.414
Where is he?
I don't know.

38:33.416 --> 38:35.249
Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying to you.

38:35.251 --> 38:37.217
I've never met him face-to-face.

38:37.219 --> 38:39.118
Okay, then how did you meet him?

38:39.120 --> 38:40.919
An associate put us in contact.

38:40.921 --> 38:42.220
Who? Who?

38:42.222 --> 38:43.955
Uh, it was a guy named Porter,

38:43.957 --> 38:45.289
but you're not gonna find him.

38:45.291 --> 38:46.957
He shot himself two weeks ago.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.325
He shot himself?

38:48.327 --> 38:50.126
You know, for a con man,
you're pretty gullible.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.862
All right, tell us how
it went down with Gabriel.

38:53.864 --> 38:57.332
Uh, well, he wired me
a half a million dollars,

38:57.334 --> 38:59.200
uh, to start.

38:59.202 --> 39:01.135
Said he was gonna pay me
five million

39:01.137 --> 39:03.337
when the job was done.
I knew I was gonna spend

39:03.339 --> 39:05.339
a little bit of time inside,
but when I got out,

39:05.341 --> 39:09.042
I was gonna go back to LA
a very rich man.

39:13.248 --> 39:15.414
Today's your lucky day.

39:15.416 --> 39:18.650
Because we're not gonna
charge you for those murders.

39:18.652 --> 39:20.001
You're gonna be booked
for theft,

39:20.002 --> 39:21.351
then you're gonna get
in contact with Gabriel.

39:21.354 --> 39:23.253
You're gonna tell him everything
went down

39:23.255 --> 39:24.387
just as you planned it.

39:24.389 --> 39:26.455
If you do that,<i> if</i> you do that,

39:26.457 --> 39:28.490
maybe you won't spend
the rest of your life in prison.

39:30.060 --> 39:31.259
(buzzer blares)

39:31.261 --> 39:33.327
(sighs)

39:35.130 --> 39:36.629
I-I know what you're thinking,
all right?

39:36.631 --> 39:39.031
But this is our only play.

39:39.033 --> 39:42.034
We arrest this guy for murder,
Gabriel knows we're on to him.

39:42.036 --> 39:43.902
Okay, I understand all that,

39:43.904 --> 39:46.137
but what about the software that
he uploaded onto our mainframe?

39:46.139 --> 39:48.139
We're gonna use it.
We're gonna use it

39:48.141 --> 39:49.340
to catch Gabriel.

39:49.342 --> 39:50.407
How are we gonna do that?

39:50.409 --> 39:52.308
We're gonna bait him.

39:52.310 --> 39:54.009
Oh, like, uh, misinformation?

39:54.011 --> 39:55.143
Exactly, right.

39:55.145 --> 39:56.911
When he bites, we hook him.

39:56.913 --> 39:59.046
Then we come back and we charge
Hank with four murders.

39:59.048 --> 40:01.014
I like it-- the long con.

40:01.016 --> 40:03.116
Good.
It's the only chance we got.

40:04.986 --> 40:07.987
CHIN:<i> I'll reach out to a few</i>
<i> CIs and see if they've heard</i>

40:07.989 --> 40:09.455
anything about a
local arms deal.

40:09.457 --> 40:12.424
I have a friend at the FBI
who owes me a favor.

40:12.426 --> 40:15.427
I'll ask him to put together
a list of all known buyers.

40:15.429 --> 40:17.562
Anyone who has enough cash
to make a shipment that big.

40:17.564 --> 40:20.231
<i> Mahalo.</i>

40:20.233 --> 40:22.199
<i> A'ole pilkia.</i>

40:22.201 --> 40:23.333
No.

40:23.335 --> 40:24.567
(chuckles)

40:24.569 --> 40:25.634
<i>A'ole pilikia.</i>

40:25.636 --> 40:27.369
(laughter)

40:27.371 --> 40:29.237
It was a six-hour flight
from San Fran.

40:29.239 --> 40:31.072
I got through most
of the travel guide.

40:31.074 --> 40:34.375
Wow.

40:34.377 --> 40:35.542
You know, I really appreciate
you jumping in

40:35.544 --> 40:37.443
with both feet on this one.

40:37.445 --> 40:39.044
I was hoping this trip
was gonna be more

40:39.046 --> 40:40.178
than just show-and-tell.

40:40.180 --> 40:41.245
Oh, yeah?

40:41.247 --> 40:42.412
What do you think so far?

40:44.015 --> 40:46.215
I like what I see.

40:46.217 --> 40:47.649
(chuckles)

40:47.651 --> 40:48.716
I'm sorry.

40:48.718 --> 40:50.350
That came out sounding weird.

40:50.352 --> 40:52.051
(chuckles) No, no.

40:52.053 --> 40:53.285
Uh, no worries.

40:53.287 --> 40:55.954
Okay.

40:55.956 --> 40:57.288
(tires squealing)

40:57.290 --> 40:59.389
(horn honks)

41:02.293 --> 41:03.358
(guns clicking)

41:10.733 --> 41:14.267
Get out of the car, Chin.

41:14.269 --> 41:15.534
Who is it?

41:15.536 --> 41:17.335
You can put your gun down.

41:17.337 --> 41:20.037
I'll handle this.

41:27.479 --> 41:29.278
You can stop looking
for the stolen guns.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.480
They're already
off the island.

41:31.482 --> 41:34.216
I should've known
it was you.

41:34.218 --> 41:36.585
I was really just
the middle man.

41:38.221 --> 41:40.087
The Chinese were greedy.

41:40.089 --> 41:41.621
So I just took the guns.

41:41.623 --> 41:45.358
I sold them to very
motivated buyers.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.659
Made so much on the deal

41:46.661 --> 41:48.327
I even paid off
your cousin's debt.

41:48.329 --> 41:49.494
You're lying.

41:49.496 --> 41:50.995
Even you're not stupid enough

41:50.997 --> 41:52.463
to show your face
in front of Shioma.

41:52.465 --> 41:54.364
He's got a price
on your head.

41:54.366 --> 41:56.566
Not as big as what
I paid him.

41:58.536 --> 42:00.736
Besides, it'd be bad form

42:00.738 --> 42:03.538
for Goro to kill someone
he just got into business with.

42:05.608 --> 42:09.509
See, unfortunately for you,

42:09.511 --> 42:13.412
I now have the Yakuza
backing my every move.

42:15.048 --> 42:17.181
Didn't have to be
this way, Chin.

42:18.484 --> 42:20.383
I came to you.

42:20.385 --> 42:22.685
I offered you a chance

42:22.687 --> 42:24.586
to be a part of this.

42:26.489 --> 42:27.454
You should've taken it.

42:27.456 --> 42:30.490
I should've done
a lot of things.

42:30.492 --> 42:32.024
(chuckles)

42:32.026 --> 42:33.392
I'm going to wipe that grin

42:33.394 --> 42:35.227
off your face soon enough.

42:35.229 --> 42:38.530
Promises, promises.

42:47.774 --> 42:50.508
(engine starts)

43:03.488 --> 43:05.387
Hey.
Hey.

43:05.389 --> 43:07.355
I got your message.

43:07.357 --> 43:08.823
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.

43:08.825 --> 43:10.324
Uh, what's going on?

43:10.326 --> 43:13.126
(sighs)

43:14.395 --> 43:16.361
Can I help you?

43:16.363 --> 43:18.496
I'd like to report
two murders.

43:20.500 --> 43:23.100
You can find the bodies in the
Makua Kea'au Forest Reserve.

43:23.102 --> 43:25.368
How do you know this?

43:28.373 --> 43:29.605
'Cause I put them there.
