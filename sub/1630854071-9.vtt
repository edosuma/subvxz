00:02.603 --> 00:04.235
(theme music)

00:45.012 --> 00:46.978
(light music)

00:47.014 --> 00:48.881
(train whistle)

00:56.157 --> 00:59.291
(sighs contentedly)
- how I love the english
countryside!

00:59.360 --> 01:00.959
- Oh!

01:01.028 --> 01:03.228
- Ah, yes, it's like a...

01:03.363 --> 01:05.663
A jane austen novel
with less corsets.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.501
- And you are?

01:09.537 --> 01:12.504
- Ah! Mr. And mrs. Crabtree.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.506
- Ah, yes, our newlyweds!

01:14.641 --> 01:16.575
I hope your ride in
was satisfactory?

01:16.710 --> 01:18.710
- Splendid.
Are you mr. Cornish?

01:18.712 --> 01:21.113
- Mr. Hathaway.
I'll be looking after you.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.048
Now, let's get you your keys.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.216
- Oh, george, look!

01:26.353 --> 01:28.520
I can't wait to try
authentic english cuisine.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.056
- "welsh rabbit"?
- Rarebit! It's cheese.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.125
- Mm.
- I think.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.794
- Well, we'll have to make
dinner reservations
as soon as he's back.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.129
- Well, wouldn't you like
to eat in our room?

01:38.165 --> 01:40.398
The sunrise suite is
the best in the hotel;

01:40.468 --> 01:42.400
It's the only one
with a private bathroom.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.269
- Isn't that the one we agreed
was too expensive?

01:44.404 --> 01:46.404
- I've been corresponding
with mr. Cornish

01:46.474 --> 01:49.208
And he agreed to offer it to us
at no extra charge.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.877
The morning view is
supposedly spectacular.

01:51.946 --> 01:55.680
- Well, I hope we'll find
something better to do
than watch the sunrise.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.082
- Here we are, then!

01:58.119 --> 02:00.252
Zlata will lead you
to your suite.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.687
(both): Oh my.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.756
(dramatic music)

02:04.792 --> 02:06.692
- How kind of you.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.693
- Zlata does not speak english.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.697
However, she is fluent
in the language of hospitality.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.798
Enjoy your stay!

02:14.835 --> 02:17.569
- Oh! There seems to be
some mistake.

02:17.605 --> 02:18.836
- I beg your pardon?

02:18.873 --> 02:20.572
- These keys are
for the garden suite.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.608
Mr. Cornish promised us
the sunrise suite.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.643
Mr. Cornish is at a convention
in leeds,

02:25.679 --> 02:28.713
But it is he
who authorized the switch.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.649
The garden suite is
our top room,

02:30.651 --> 02:33.318
With finer amenities and
a view of the rose garden.

02:34.388 --> 02:37.589
I assure you
your needs will be met.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.641
- You're welcome.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.113
(groaning)

03:05.352 --> 03:07.219
- So was I supposed
to give her a tip?

03:07.221 --> 03:09.955
How many shillings
in a farthing?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.356
(sighs)
what's wrong?

03:11.491 --> 03:13.759
- This bed feels lumpy.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.228
And those creatures are ghastly.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.699
- Well, you'll feel better once
you take in the rose garden.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.600
Come on.
(groaning)

03:28.209 --> 03:29.874
What do you think?

03:29.910 --> 03:32.577
- I think mr. Hathaway
is pulling a fast one.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.446
- You may need to let this go,
effie.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.381
I mean, somebody else
must have booked
the sunrise suite.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.383
There's not much
we can do about it now.

03:42.189 --> 03:45.190
I think it'll take more
than a bottle of wine
to pull this off, effie.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.392
- Don't be such a naysayer.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.561
I'm sure they'll be happy
to switch once they learn
we're on our honeymoon.

03:52.265 --> 03:54.433
- I don't know why you think
this room is gonna be
any better than ours.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.468
- Well, you haven't seen it yet.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.603
Faces the sunrise,
which is considered good luck.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.140
- Give it a proper
policeman's knock.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.009
(door creaking)

04:06.547 --> 04:08.013
(gasps)

04:08.082 --> 04:10.349
- George, he's dead.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.684
- Not so lucky after all.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.963
- Oh! Postcard
from effie and george.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.964
- Oh?
Where are they now?

04:27.001 --> 04:30.234
- They've left paris
and they're due to arrive
in hampshire today.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.839
How thrilling it would be
to be on your honeymoon.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.174
- Certainly was for us.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.109
Do you remember that dinner
in new york city?

04:38.178 --> 04:40.178
- How could I forget?

04:40.247 --> 04:42.647
We couldn't keep our eyes
off each other.

04:42.716 --> 04:47.185
- So much so
we almost didn't notice the
oysters rockefeller arriving.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.586
(chuckling)

04:48.588 --> 04:51.323
- I suppose it's hard to keep
that kind of passion alive,

04:51.325 --> 04:54.726
What with susannah and work.

05:00.034 --> 05:04.001
- Do you feel our relationship
is lacking passion?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.972
(phone ringing)

05:15.316 --> 05:16.614
Hello?

05:16.684 --> 05:17.882
Yes it is.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.952
I'll be right there.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.289
Duty calls.

05:24.424 --> 05:25.824
- Hm.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.628
(urban soundscape,
indistinct chatter)

05:37.471 --> 05:39.104
- Excuse me, miss?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.972
I'm looking for room 415.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.442
- The man who died?
- Yes, you've heard?

05:43.577 --> 05:46.378
- I alerted the front desk
when he wouldn't answer
the door.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.114
None of us were surprised
when he took his own life.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.983
He was acting peculiar.
- It was a suicide?

05:51.985 --> 05:53.651
- As far as I know.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.387
Straight down the hall,
second door to your left.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.954
- Thank you.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.329
- This one seems rather obvious.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.464
- An overdosing?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.399
Based on the empty bottle
of laudanum

06:08.435 --> 06:11.669
And excess fluid in his throat,
I'd say yes.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.672
- Do we have a name?

06:13.674 --> 06:15.073
- Nathan cumberland, sir.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.476
He arrived last week
from thunder bay.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.312
Told everyone in the hotel that
his ship had finally come in.

06:20.314 --> 06:21.679
- Meaning?

06:21.681 --> 06:23.281
- Some real estate deal, sir.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.417
Poor man thought
he had tripled his money.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.386
He was buying his fellow
guests drinks all week

06:27.521 --> 06:30.355
And boasting about finally
making his wife and child proud.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.557
- And his arrangement soured?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.760
- Apparently the cheque
he received was fraudulent

06:34.895 --> 06:37.095
And his "investor"
flew the coop.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.499
The other guests noted
a concerning change
in his demeanor after that.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.635
- Henry,

06:43.770 --> 06:46.103
Does this man look familiar
to you?

06:47.374 --> 06:49.006
- No.
Should he?

06:50.177 --> 06:51.710
- I don't know.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.512
- Uh, sir, this is dr. Bellows.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.448
He was with the victim
when he perished.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.183
- You're a doctor?
- Yes.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.118
Yes, I'm staying at the hotel.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.120
They knocked on my door
when they found him.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.922
I did everything I could.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.157
- Was he conscious
when you arrived?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.526
- Barely.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.661
But he did seem
to understand me.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.931
He willingly took the ipecac
I gave him to expel the drugs.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.733
Unfortunately, it was too late.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.604
- People often have a change
of heart when committing
self-murder...

07:19.673 --> 07:21.739
Assuming that's what this was.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.274
- It's likely, sir.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.009
He also left this.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.777
It appears to be a suicide note.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.615
- "I am leaving a world
I am not fit to live in.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.618
I have failed you
as a husband, as a father

07:33.753 --> 07:35.820
And as a fellow human being."

07:35.889 --> 07:37.421
It's tragic.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.957
- Is there anything else
you need from me?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.292
I'm afraid
I have an appointment.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.960
- No.
Thank you.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.028
- Constable higgins
has all my information.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.630
Good day.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.101
- Seems fairly open-and-shut,
sir. Shall I write it up?

07:50.137 --> 07:52.370
- Not quite yet, henry.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.439
There's something
I'd like you to do for me.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.913
- I trust this will not impact
my eight o'clock
dinner reservations.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.715
- Not if I can help it.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.984
- Good evening, my lovelies!

08:05.986 --> 08:08.653
I'm sure we've all heard
about the incident,

08:08.788 --> 08:10.788
But I can assure you
everything is fine.

08:10.858 --> 08:14.392
His name was arthur furlong,
a regular at this hotel.

08:14.428 --> 08:17.528
It appears he died in his sleep.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.598
And his family
has been informed.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.801
Please enjoy some of
our famous house sherry,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.803
Compliments of the hotel.

08:28.609 --> 08:32.143
And please, let's relax
and put this mess behind us.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.745
- Good gracious!

08:33.747 --> 08:35.747
People drink this
of their choice?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.882
- Do you think
there's a killer among us?

08:37.918 --> 08:39.417
- A killer?

08:39.419 --> 08:41.419
Effie, did you not just hear
what the man said?

08:41.455 --> 08:42.487
- Oh, come now!

08:42.622 --> 08:44.222
You really believe
he died in his sleep?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.824
He couldn't have been a day
over 50.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.159
- People can die at any age.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.095
- Mr. Hathaway is clearly in
on it.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.499
In fact, now that everyone's
mingling, it's a perfect time.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.101
- Perfect time for what?

08:56.103 --> 08:58.703
- To sneak into the room
and poke around.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.038
- Effie, I'm an officer
of the law.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.240
- Exactly!
All the more reason!

09:02.309 --> 09:03.908
If there is a cover-up afoot,

09:03.977 --> 09:06.211
It's your duty,
as an investigator,
to follow up.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.448
- People do seem distracted.

09:10.517 --> 09:14.752
- Did I mention that danger
makes me amorous?

09:16.657 --> 09:19.391
- I'll need your, ah, hair pin.
- Hm.

09:25.299 --> 09:26.798
- Never seen him before.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.401
- Are you certain?
- Yes!

09:29.403 --> 09:31.802
Why not just close the file
and be done with it?

09:31.838 --> 09:33.605
Poor bugger
clearly offed himself.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.676
- He was supposedly
swindled by an investor
in a real estate scam,

09:37.811 --> 09:39.544
But I found no paperwork
on his person,

09:39.679 --> 09:41.279
Or any sign of the investor.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.014
- You think there was
no investor?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.683
Or perhaps there was,

09:44.685 --> 09:46.217
But he removed any evidence
to cover his tracks.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.352
(knocking on door)
- sirs.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.953
I've searched our files

09:49.022 --> 09:50.655
And found no nathan cumberland.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.023
In fact, there's no record
of him anywhere.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.058
But, in good news,

09:54.094 --> 09:55.894
There's a new meat
pie shop on colbourne.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.362
May I break for lunch?

09:57.431 --> 10:00.632
- Actually, I need you
to pay a visit to mrs. Hart
at the morgue.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.301
- Uh... The meat pie shop's
in the opposite direction, sir.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.036
- You might want
to hold off on lunch.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.438
I need you to lift
fingermarks off a corpse.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.207
- Oh.

10:15.649 --> 10:16.914
- Oh, my.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.516
They have a love seat.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.385
And a piano!

10:21.588 --> 10:23.455
(plays a tune)
- are you crazy?

10:23.457 --> 10:27.191
- There is no chance
the garden suite is
the top suite in this hotel.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.927
Wait a minute...

10:28.929 --> 10:31.730
Are we doing all this
so you could compare suites?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.798
- Oh, come on, george.
You were curious, too.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.533
- I don't believe it.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.469
Do you even think
this chap was murdered?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.671
(gasps)
- lavender!

10:39.673 --> 10:42.273
It smells like
the fields of somerset.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.478
- Effie! The door!
Get under the bed.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.706
(creaking)

11:21.982 --> 11:24.115
- Henry?
Did you get the fingermarks?

11:24.250 --> 11:25.916
- Ah, yes, sir,
and you were right.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.252
Nathan cumberland is
actually harvey knowles

11:28.288 --> 11:29.921
And we do have a file on him.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.656
Guess who opened it?

11:35.262 --> 11:36.695
- Afternoon, detective.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.964
- You know perfectly well
I'm no longer a detective.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.566
- I do, indeed.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.335
But I'm hoping I can convince
you to play one,

11:44.471 --> 11:46.204
At least for an afternoon.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.842
I'm looking into a man's death.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.477
- Well, you certainly
are consistent.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.612
His name is, uh...

11:54.681 --> 11:56.814
Harvey knowles.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.589
(both sigh in relief)

12:40.861 --> 12:42.693
- That was close!

12:42.729 --> 12:44.862
- Who was that chap?
Why did he have a gun?

12:44.931 --> 12:46.664
What was he doing in here?

12:46.666 --> 12:48.332
- George, look!

12:48.368 --> 12:50.268
The lavender soap... It's gone.

12:51.938 --> 12:56.007
- I suppose even murderers want
a supple scent to their skin.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.877
(chuckling)
- oh my god.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.812
This is so exciting.

13:00.814 --> 13:03.081
Feel my heart, it's pounding!

13:05.552 --> 13:07.685
(both moaning)

13:11.324 --> 13:13.858
(giggling)

13:17.230 --> 13:18.696
- Wait a minute!

13:18.765 --> 13:20.297
A man died on this bed!

13:20.333 --> 13:21.833
- Who cares?

13:30.910 --> 13:32.844
- Ah! George!

13:32.979 --> 13:34.846
That wasn't there before!

13:41.454 --> 13:42.987
- It's still warm.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.455
Well, mice don't just die
like that.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.990
Could it have eaten something?

13:48.695 --> 13:50.261
- Wait a minute.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.966
Effie, look at this.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.572
- That doesn't look right.
- This hose has been
disconnected.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.142
- Do you feel a little nauseous?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.210
- Oh, my god.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.945
It's gas.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.615
- That was on purpose,
wasn't it?

14:10.684 --> 14:13.084
- Someone was venting
carbon monoxide into the room.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.685
- Does this mean
what I think it means?

14:14.754 --> 14:16.621
- It means you were right
the first time.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.023
Mr. Furlong didn't die
of natural causes.

14:19.158 --> 14:20.791
He was murdered.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.366
- I can't believe it.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.301
There really is a killer
among us.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.102
- And it's too late
to alert the authorities.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.105
And we're a half-day
from civilization,

14:34.107 --> 14:36.107
Thanks to your insistence
on booking the most remote hotel

14:36.109 --> 14:37.775
In the western hemisphere.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.311
- You're not really still on
about that inn in marseille
you were pushing for?

14:40.347 --> 14:41.980
- No, I'm sorry!
Look, we should work together.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.648
- Agreed. We're the only ones
we can trust.

14:44.684 --> 14:48.185
- Someone's gone to great
lengths to make mr. Furlong's
death look accidental.

14:48.221 --> 14:52.056
- The sunrise suite
is the only one
with a private bathroom.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.959
- Which means it's the only one
that could be rigged
to emit carbon monoxide.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.861
- Ergo whoever arranged
the switch must be in on it.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.664
- Mr. Hathaway.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.865
- I knew there was something off
about him.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.936
- He must have made the switch
when mr. Cornish left for leeds.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.538
And then pretended the idea
came from mr. Cornish himself.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.006
- How do we prove it?

15:09.075 --> 15:11.342
- I saw a ledger behind
the desk.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.944
It should tell us everything.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.979
- How do we get it
without hathaway seeing?

15:15.982 --> 15:17.414
- I have an idea.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.492
- Mrs. Crabtree!
- Ah!

15:28.528 --> 15:31.228
- Are you enjoying the splendors
of the garden suite?

15:31.264 --> 15:33.631
- Oh, indeed, indeed.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.032
Now who's this?

15:35.068 --> 15:37.101
- That's mr. Cornish.
- Hm.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.837
There seem to be many photos
of him and none of you.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.573
Not all of us are as vain as he.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.108
- You don't like him, do you?

15:44.177 --> 15:46.577
Are you jealous that he's been
invited to a convention in leeds

15:46.646 --> 15:48.046
While you're stuck here?

15:48.048 --> 15:51.783
- I wouldn't wish leeds on
anyone, least of all myself.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.653
Besides, mr. Cornish
has seniority over me,

15:55.788 --> 15:57.722
Thus it was the logical choice.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.191
- Yes, that's one theory.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.527
Allow me to posit another:

16:02.529 --> 16:05.296
Mr. Cornish was chosen over you
because, as a manager,

16:05.431 --> 16:07.865
He would never
have put up with this!

16:09.669 --> 16:11.536
We found this in our room!

16:11.538 --> 16:14.605
Is this the type of service
becoming of your
supposed top suite?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.207
- Please keep your voice down!

16:16.276 --> 16:17.842
- I will not be silenced!

16:17.977 --> 16:20.411
Not until you tell me
how a mouse got into my suite!

16:20.480 --> 16:22.279
- How about a fruit plate?!

16:22.315 --> 16:24.948
A lovely selection of fruits
will be on the way to your room,

16:24.985 --> 16:27.885
Compliments of the house.
- And a cheese plate?

16:27.921 --> 16:29.820
- Yes, of course.
Also complimentary.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.088
- And a bottle of armagnac.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.291
- I can arrange for some
of our fine house sherry.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.427
- Armagnac, take or leave.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.429
Twenty years, minimum.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.565
- Perhaps I can rustle up a ten.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.900
- That may suffice.

16:42.936 --> 16:47.305
- And you need to promise
to keep this little incident
under wraps.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.973
- That'll depend on how quickly
we get the goods.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.642
Chop-chop!

17:03.156 --> 17:06.056
- I employed harvey knowles
on occasion as an informant.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.059
He used to run swindles.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.795
- Knowles was a con artist?
- Hm. Charming one at that.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.332
Surprised to see him die
this way.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.733
- You don't believe knowles
took his own life?

17:16.770 --> 17:20.405
- I don't believe knowles
would have fallen
for a real estate scam.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.939
- What makes you so sure?

17:22.075 --> 17:24.675
- Well, he would have known
what a fraudulent cheque
looked like

17:24.811 --> 17:27.144
Because he ended up running
a fraudulent cheque scheme
himself,

17:27.213 --> 17:29.480
Which was rather
out of character.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.282
- How so?

17:31.351 --> 17:34.752
- Knowles and his former
partner-in-crime,
bernadette childs,

17:34.887 --> 17:38.289
Had a code in which
they only swindled
those they felt deserved it.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.026
And they parted ways
years earlier.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.895
- Did he find another partner?

17:44.030 --> 17:46.196
- If he did, that's news to me.

17:46.232 --> 17:50.234
- Knowles was a solitary figure
who kept to himself

17:50.303 --> 17:52.436
And I haven't seen him
in over a year.

17:52.505 --> 17:56.974
- Well, surely he must have
a more current acquaintance
that could help us?

17:56.976 --> 17:58.976
- No one I know.

17:59.045 --> 18:03.247
Although I do recall a wealthy
woman he was courting.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.316
- What was her name?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.985
- I'm sure I wrote it down
somewhere,

18:08.054 --> 18:10.254
Though she'd be of little use.

18:10.389 --> 18:12.022
- Little is all we have.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.327
(sighs)
- I cannot believe it.

18:16.329 --> 18:20.531
My beloved harvey,
taking his own life.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.869
- Did he strike you
as depressed?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.604
- Oh, heavens, no.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.806
But he did strike me
as passionate.

18:28.941 --> 18:33.945
I can only assume he was
burdened by the passing
of his beloved aunt esther.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.247
- Which aunt was this again?

18:36.249 --> 18:38.282
- Oh, h-his favourite,
of course.

18:38.284 --> 18:42.553
The one who raised him after
his parents died in that fire.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.959
- Did you know this woman?

18:47.961 --> 18:51.429
- We corresponded often by mail.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.931
We never did meet in person,

18:54.066 --> 18:57.101
But I suppose it's for
the best, given her condition.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.503
- Mm-mm.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.238
Refresh my memory.

19:01.374 --> 19:04.775
- Oh, the poor woman suffered
from tuberculosis.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.744
She was given months to live,

19:06.879 --> 19:11.449
But then harvey found
a revolutionary clinic
in new york.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.150
- New york?

19:13.186 --> 19:15.186
That sounds like
a costly undertaking.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.322
- Oh, it was,
but it was worth it.

19:18.457 --> 19:21.458
The clinic prolonged her life
by years.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.194
I was happy to chip in,

19:24.230 --> 19:27.198
Buoyed by her lovely
thank you letters.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.268
- Uh, these letters she sent.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.470
Do you by chance
still have them?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.609
- Good lord. I knew it!
- What is it?

19:38.678 --> 19:41.479
- The sunrise suite,
not the garden suite,
is the top suite!

19:41.481 --> 19:44.815
- That's all well and good,
but perhaps we should focus
on who switched the rooms?

19:44.951 --> 19:48.286
- Right, constable.
We are solving a murder here.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.886
This is curious.

19:49.923 --> 19:52.556
George, it wasn't mr. Furlong
who took our room.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.359
- Who did?
- A man named mr. Castle.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.362
And the switch was authorized
by mr. Hathaway,
not mr. Cornish!

19:58.364 --> 20:00.965
- Castle. Isn't he's the chap
with the 8 p.M. Dinner
reservation?

20:00.967 --> 20:03.634
- So how did mr. Castle and mr.
Furlong end up switching rooms?

20:03.769 --> 20:07.505
- If castle was in the sunrise
suite, where was furlong?

20:07.640 --> 20:10.274
- Arthur furlong, the oak suite.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.309
- Does that mean castle's
in the oak suite now?

20:12.345 --> 20:15.512
- Perhaps mr. Castle rigged
his room to emit carbon
monoxide

20:15.548 --> 20:17.848
And then convinced mr. Furlong
to switch.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.651
- Hell of a way to commit
a discreet murder.

20:20.653 --> 20:24.054
Do you think mr. Castle
and mr. Hathaway
could be working together?

20:24.123 --> 20:26.724
- I think we need to get
into that oak suite
and see what we can find.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.792
- You said he had 8 p.M.
Dinner reservations?

20:28.828 --> 20:31.729
- It's quarter past eight now.
That room should be empty
for another hour at least.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.197
- What if we get caught?

20:33.199 --> 20:36.133
- Then we pretend we're lost
and tip immediately.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.269
- A shilling. Now is that more
or less than a farthing?

20:38.338 --> 20:40.804
- I don't think anybody knows.
Let's get on with it.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.677
- Parents who died in a fire.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.612
That's quite the yarn.

20:48.681 --> 20:52.683
- Sometimes the bigger the
lie the easier it is to tell.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.152
Well, just as I suspected,

20:55.288 --> 20:57.855
The handwriting in aunt esther's
thank-you letters

20:57.857 --> 21:00.424
Matches that of harvey knowles'
suicide note.

21:00.559 --> 21:03.561
- He was posing
as the grateful aunt
to keep those cheques coming.

21:05.164 --> 21:07.898
- Something tells me
it isn't the first time
he's pulled this scheme.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.902
- Leaving a number of potential
victims with motive for murder.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.738
- The question is where did
he send these from?

21:14.774 --> 21:17.708
Certainly not new york,
given the ontario stamp.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.176
- Aha!

21:19.245 --> 21:22.479
Our miss alcock is not
the sharpest tool in the shed.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.783
What's that?
- A mistake?

21:25.852 --> 21:27.318
- Mm.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.320
Seems oddly placed
for a mistake.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.993
- Is that some sort of flower?

21:36.062 --> 21:37.627
- A lily.

21:39.065 --> 21:42.466
Did I not see that on
the sign at hotel florentine?

21:42.601 --> 21:45.335
- I'll have henry connect
with the concierge.

21:53.046 --> 21:55.212
- Oh, that is so not fair.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.548
This room has a chaise lounge!

21:57.617 --> 21:59.816
- Effie, focus!

22:03.089 --> 22:04.521
- Right.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.892
- Do you see anything unusual?

22:08.027 --> 22:12.029
- Only that mr. Castle has
exceptional taste in clothes.

22:12.031 --> 22:15.232
This is one of the most finely
tailored shirts I've ever seen.

22:15.268 --> 22:16.933
Feel this.

22:21.841 --> 22:25.442
- "g.R." hardly stands
for ernest castle.

22:27.513 --> 22:28.846
- Oh, my.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.247
- Good lord!

22:30.316 --> 22:32.583
His soap collection costs
more than my entire wardrobe.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.518
Is that a gun case?

22:37.990 --> 22:40.791
Where's the gun?
(clicking)

22:42.161 --> 22:43.927
- What a tragedy.

22:43.963 --> 22:44.961
Poor granville!

22:44.997 --> 22:47.063
- Granville?
- Granville?

22:47.100 --> 22:49.733
- Oh!
Uh, granville barrington.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.001
- Uh-huh.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.204
- Uh, he was a... A favourite
guest at the florentine.

22:53.339 --> 22:56.140
Every guest was charmed
and delighted by him.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.875
He was quite a character.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.010
- When did he stay there?

23:00.146 --> 23:01.946
- It must have been,
uh, two months ago?

23:02.081 --> 23:05.416
He... He came in to cash in
on a real estate deal,

23:05.485 --> 23:08.819
But, unfortunately,
the investor bamboozled him.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.353
- Let me guess.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.023
He gave granville a fraudulent
cheque and left town.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.891
- Why, yes.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.627
He took it very hard.
- Uh-huh.

23:17.663 --> 23:19.696
Uh, he tried to end
his own life.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.766
We were all very grateful
there happened to be
a doctor at the hotel.

23:22.835 --> 23:27.504
- Who administered ipecac
in order to expel
the laudanum he'd ingested?

23:27.573 --> 23:29.173
- Right again.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.041
It was quite the scene,
ah,

23:31.043 --> 23:33.510
Everyone was grateful
to see granville survive.

23:33.579 --> 23:37.848
Uh, the doctor even spearheaded
a charity drive to get him back
on his feet

23:37.983 --> 23:40.250
And, uh, everyone chipped in.

23:40.286 --> 23:43.119
- The doctor who gave him
the ipecac,
do you remember his name?

23:43.156 --> 23:45.322
- Ah... Bellows.

23:45.358 --> 23:46.790
Dr. Gordon bellows.

23:50.163 --> 23:52.229
- What's your business
with mr. Castle?

23:53.332 --> 23:55.399
- Well, you know, really,
we were just, uh,

23:55.401 --> 23:58.936
Interested in the layout
of the room and, uh...

23:59.005 --> 24:00.871
Oh, you should see the soap!

24:10.550 --> 24:12.850
- George!
(both): What?

24:12.919 --> 24:15.619
- Back!
Get back here. Get back!

24:16.789 --> 24:18.822
Now I'm gonna ask you
one last time.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.692
What exactly is your business
with mr. Castle?

24:23.095 --> 24:24.628
- You're not mr. Castle.

24:26.165 --> 24:29.834
You're george v,
the king of England.

24:39.846 --> 24:40.911
G.R.

24:41.046 --> 24:42.646
George rex, for the king!

24:42.648 --> 24:44.782
That's why you had those
initials in your undergarments!

24:44.784 --> 24:46.783
- You saw my undergarments?

24:46.819 --> 24:49.820
- I can't believe we're sitting
here with the king of England!

24:49.822 --> 24:51.221
- Keep your voice down!

24:51.224 --> 24:54.124
- He is the king and he could
have you charged with treason.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.793
- So what are you doing
in hampshire?

24:56.863 --> 24:59.530
- I am much more interested
in why the two of you are here.

24:59.532 --> 25:02.465
- Well, we came for the lovely
foliage and the world-class
buffet.

25:02.502 --> 25:05.269
- I mean, why you are
here in my room.

25:05.338 --> 25:07.738
- Your majesty, please accept
our humble apologies.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.674
I'm george crabtree
with the toronto constabulary

25:10.676 --> 25:12.642
And I'm here on honeymoon
with my wife effie.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.078
- You're a police officer?

25:14.213 --> 25:15.746
- Uh, in canada.
That's right.

25:15.748 --> 25:19.883
- Police or no police,
you still need to explain
why you are in my room.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.252
- Well, the truth is,
your majesty,

25:22.255 --> 25:24.555
We found evidence
that arthur furlong,

25:24.690 --> 25:26.891
The man staying in the sunrise
suite, was murdered.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.494
- Carbon monoxide. Somebody
tampered with the gas heater
in his ensuite bathroom.

25:30.496 --> 25:33.830
- We were curious
only because we were initially
assigned that room.

25:33.866 --> 25:37.100
- If this is true, your majesty,
our worst fears are confirmed.

25:39.472 --> 25:42.906
- What you're about to hear
must be kept in
the strictest of confidence

25:42.975 --> 25:44.642
By order of the crown.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.779
- Yes, yes, your majesty.

25:48.781 --> 25:52.115
- The reason my valet wadsworth
and I are traveling incognito

25:52.151 --> 25:54.785
Is to visit my troubled son,
edward,

25:54.787 --> 25:59.389
Who is honing his academics at
a special school in portsmouth.

25:59.425 --> 26:02.125
It was a risk I was willing
to take,

26:02.161 --> 26:05.529
Even given the presence
of the black chalice.

26:05.664 --> 26:08.665
The black chalice is
a secretive organization

26:08.701 --> 26:11.869
Pushing back on my plans
to reform
the hereditary peerage.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.738
- We've long suspected that
there might be members
in these parts

26:14.740 --> 26:16.807
And, evidently, we were right.

26:16.809 --> 26:20.210
- You see, wadsworth secured me
the hotel's top suite,

26:20.279 --> 26:23.413
Which we must have
unknowingly taken from you.

26:23.449 --> 26:28.285
I was unable to take my
afternoon nap on account
of my grievous musophobia.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.153
- Musophob...

26:30.222 --> 26:32.089
Is that a british affliction?

26:33.993 --> 26:35.425
- His majesty is
fearful of mice.

26:35.461 --> 26:36.827
- Ah!

26:38.097 --> 26:40.330
- So I fled my suite.
- And neglected to inform me.

26:40.399 --> 26:44.501
And happened upon mr. Furlong
enjoying a cigar in the garden.

26:44.570 --> 26:46.503
I explained my situation

26:46.539 --> 26:50.473
And he offered to switch, since
my room was clearly superior.

26:52.244 --> 26:55.079
Now that we know the room
had been tampered with,

26:55.081 --> 26:59.183
The only conclusion is
that we were the target.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.417
- We?

27:00.552 --> 27:02.719
- His majesty is using
the royal "we."

27:02.755 --> 27:03.954
- Uh.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.657
- So what is your...
Our... Our plan?

27:06.792 --> 27:07.991
- We will do nothing.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.493
- But there's a murderer
out there!

27:09.495 --> 27:11.995
- Given that their first attempt
was a failure,

27:12.031 --> 27:13.864
They're unlikely to strike again
tonight

27:13.933 --> 27:15.532
So long as they assume
we're not onto them.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.769
Now, please,
return to your room and
pretend you know nothing.

27:18.904 --> 27:22.139
I will arrange for
his majesty to be escorted
to safety at dawn.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.843
- You will remember me
only as ernest castle.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.478
And you will never speak
of this again.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.484
- I checked with the
canadian medical registry.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.819
Dr. Gordon bellows has been
dead for five years.

27:35.821 --> 27:39.356
- Person posing as him
has procured a pretty penny
off his name.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.759
- It's quite the brilliant
scheme he and his partner,
knowles, had going.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.894
Knowles would check into
a hotel

27:44.930 --> 27:46.897
Posing as a man whose ship
had come in.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.232
- And his partner-in-crime,
posing as dr. Bellows,

27:49.268 --> 27:51.167
Would show up
several days later.

27:51.203 --> 27:54.071
- Then knowles would reveal
that his windfall had backfired

27:54.140 --> 27:56.506
And made clear that he intended
to take his own life,

27:56.542 --> 27:58.508
Going so far as to
ingest laudanum.

27:58.544 --> 28:02.179
- Dr. Bellows would be called in
and use ipecac
to expel the laudanum,

28:02.181 --> 28:05.381
Creating a scene so authentic
no one would dare question it.

28:05.418 --> 28:09.119
- The perfect opening
to mount an appeal
for money in knowles' name

28:09.188 --> 28:12.389
And then milking
the hotel guests
for everything they're worth.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.992
- He probably volunteered
a large portion of his own money

28:14.994 --> 28:16.727
From the very first time
they pulled this con.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.531
- Well, harvey knowles' murder
seems to be coming into
sharper focus.

28:20.666 --> 28:23.000
- Apparently the swindler
got swindled.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.401
His partner likely offed him
to keep all the money.

28:25.438 --> 28:28.805
- Let's get a sketch
of this medical imposter
straight away.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.641
- I'll connect with
our sketch artist

28:30.776 --> 28:32.810
And make sure henry
distributes it all over town.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.746
- One thing that bothers me:

28:35.748 --> 28:38.948
Hotel guests saw the doctor
give the victim ipecac.

28:38.984 --> 28:40.617
Why didn't it work?

28:40.686 --> 28:42.152
- Hm.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.754
- Once I deliver the sketch,

28:43.889 --> 28:45.823
I'll drop in on mrs. Hart
at the morgue.

28:45.825 --> 28:48.024
- Do you mind if I tag along?

28:48.094 --> 28:50.026
- You're not getting paid.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.394
- Uh-huh.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.031
- The king of England!

28:55.067 --> 28:56.433
Can you believe
that just happened?

28:56.568 --> 28:57.834
- No, nor will anyone else.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.436
No one will believe
this happened to us!

28:59.571 --> 29:01.772
- George, if mr. Hathaway is
a member of the black chalice,

29:01.907 --> 29:03.707
Do you think he's working
alone, or is he...

29:03.709 --> 29:06.910
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
We need to keep our voices down.
We made a promise to the crown.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.446
- Then I suppose we have no
choice but to get back

29:10.483 --> 29:12.248
To why we came here
in the first place.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.650
- Ah. Oh!

29:18.724 --> 29:20.791
(knocking on door)

29:27.566 --> 29:29.065
(both): Oh, my!

29:30.536 --> 29:34.071
- As suspected, his blood
was saturated
with opium and alcohol,

29:34.206 --> 29:36.073
The main ingredients
in laudanum.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.075
- Why wasn't it expelled?

29:38.210 --> 29:41.745
Uh, witnesses saw knowles
be administered ipecac.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.149
- They might have seen him
take some kind of syrup,

29:45.284 --> 29:46.817
But it wasn't ipecac.

29:46.819 --> 29:49.352
I found traces of starches
and sugars, nothing else.

29:50.890 --> 29:54.824
- Could our fake doctor
have switched the ipecac
for a placebo syrup?

29:54.860 --> 29:57.460
- If he did,
he's guilty of murder.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.612
- You're welcome.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.717
- Oh!
- Uh...

30:31.197 --> 30:32.930
- Hathaway can't be
working alone.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.464
I bet she's in on it.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.866
- Maybe they're all in on it?

30:35.935 --> 30:37.667
Should we follow her?

30:40.439 --> 30:41.804
- Julia?

30:47.746 --> 30:49.579
- Hello, stranger.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.681
- What's all this?

30:53.752 --> 30:56.353
- Do you recognize this dress?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.821
- It's lovely.
Should I?

30:58.858 --> 31:00.857
- I wore it on our honeymoon.

31:00.926 --> 31:02.292
- Ah!

31:02.328 --> 31:04.861
- The night we couldn't take
our eyes off each other.

31:04.996 --> 31:06.529
- Oh.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.300
- The nanny has taken susannah
to the park.

31:10.435 --> 31:12.102
We have some time to kill.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.639
Ooh. Ah, julia,

31:15.774 --> 31:19.175
I must admit you've caught me
off guard.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.644
(phone ringing)

31:20.646 --> 31:22.045
Uh...

31:24.249 --> 31:25.515
Hello?

31:25.584 --> 31:28.051
Yes.
Which intersection?

31:29.321 --> 31:30.787
I'll be right there.

31:33.392 --> 31:37.327
Julia, a man matching
doctor bellows' description
has been spotted.

31:38.497 --> 31:43.200
We'll have to delay our date,
but only a little.

31:48.741 --> 31:52.142
It was there, in the ruins
of thebes,

31:52.144 --> 31:55.612
Where we found the lost tomb
of asclepius

31:55.747 --> 32:00.183
And discovered the healing
properties of its sands!

32:01.153 --> 32:03.553
Sprinkle a few grains
in your bed

32:03.589 --> 32:08.425
And watch as back pain,
rheumatism and
arthritis disappear overnight!

32:08.427 --> 32:10.827
This miracle of the east

32:10.896 --> 32:13.563
Can be yours for less
than the cost of...

32:16.234 --> 32:17.701
Terribly sorry,
ladies and gentleman.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.869
We've just run out!

32:25.377 --> 32:27.510
(man): We shall go upstairs
in a moment, dear.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.545
You're on the wrong floor,
darling.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.387
- Seems curious that they need
to lock the coal room.

32:37.522 --> 32:39.255
- Unless it serves
some other purpose.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.858
Like secret meeting room
for the black chalice.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.935
- Yes, I... I've engaged
in a swindle or two
in my time

32:52.004 --> 32:55.472
To make ends meet,
but I'm not a murderer.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.141
- You gave your partner
a benign syrup

32:58.177 --> 32:59.876
When he was expecting ipecac.

32:59.878 --> 33:01.511
- Harvey was
like a brother to me.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.112
Why would I want him dead?

33:04.283 --> 33:06.216
- To reap his half of
the profits, for starters.

33:07.886 --> 33:11.954
- We were going to pull our
hotel con in every province
in the country

33:11.991 --> 33:14.290
And we hadn't even finished
ontario yet.

33:14.326 --> 33:18.128
Yes, detective,
harvey was a financial
windfall to me,

33:18.197 --> 33:20.630
But, more important,

33:20.632 --> 33:22.832
He was my best friend.

33:24.370 --> 33:28.871
I am as devastated
and confused by his death
as everyone else is.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.379
May I please leave now?

33:43.022 --> 33:44.387
Thank you, gentlemen.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.656
I think I can take it from here.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.925
- Off he goes to swindle again.

33:48.961 --> 33:50.794
- Most likely.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.129
You have to admit
his story rings true.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.664
- I don't disagree.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.867
Why go through lengths
to switch the ipecac

33:57.002 --> 33:59.202
When he could have ignored
the call in the first place?

33:59.204 --> 34:02.405
- Unless someone else switched
it without his knowledge.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.740
- But who would have access
to his room?

34:04.777 --> 34:06.275
Friend?

34:06.311 --> 34:09.012
- Perhaps this warrants
another visit to the hotel?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.755
- Well, I don't think
the black chalice are holding
any meetings in here.

34:18.824 --> 34:22.425
- Let's just pretend
to get some coal
and go back to our room.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.228
- Well, we could if we had
a coal shovel.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.097
- You lost it, remember?

34:27.166 --> 34:29.566
- No, dear, you lost it.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.701
In any case,
I'll get some firewood.

34:31.703 --> 34:34.237
- Georgie, I hate to bring
this up, but it was you
who lost the shovel.

34:34.273 --> 34:37.373
- No, effie, I clearly remember
you had it

34:37.409 --> 34:39.509
When you were saying
it felt drafty.

34:39.644 --> 34:41.177
- No, I distinct... Ah!
Oh my god!

34:41.246 --> 34:42.579
Oh my god!

34:42.581 --> 34:43.980
It's mr. Cornish!

34:46.351 --> 34:49.285
- I guess he didn't make it
to that convention in leeds
after all.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.460
(knocking)

34:59.565 --> 35:00.797
- Your majesty.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.999
- Ah, mr. Castle,
we hate to bother you,

35:03.068 --> 35:05.201
But we've got
a bit of a situation!

35:05.337 --> 35:07.036
- This had better be good.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.338
- We were collecting firewood.

35:09.374 --> 35:11.474
My wife and I discovered
the body of mr. Cornish!

35:11.543 --> 35:13.710
- The day manager? No!
He's at a convention in leeds.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.146
- No, he's in the coal room.
He's been garroted.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.882
- Proof positive that
mr. Hathaway is a member
of the black chalice.

35:19.017 --> 35:21.751
- And zlata, too, no doubt.
She had a key to the room.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.353
- I reckon the whole hotel
is in on it.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.855
- Oh, this changes everything.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.623
The assailants are gonna know
that we're onto them;

35:26.692 --> 35:28.158
This may trigger a response.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.492
- We need to leave now.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.760
- Agreed.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.497
But mr. Hathaway is likely
to be black chalice.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.833
You two newlyweds are gonna
need to help us
by creating a distraction

35:36.835 --> 35:38.234
So that we can slip away
to the stables.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.436
- How are we supposed
to do that?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.839
- A petty hotel squabble
should do the trick.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.507
Ten minutes, tops,
is all we need.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.975
But it'll need
to feel authentic.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.743
- Can we count on you two?

35:50.782 --> 35:52.315
- I don't understand.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.517
I thought mr. Cumberland
took his own life.

35:54.553 --> 35:57.921
- His name was harvey knowles
and all is not what it seems.

35:58.056 --> 35:59.855
We need to know
who among your staff

35:59.892 --> 36:02.392
Would have access to room 415.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.528
- This is a small,
private hotel and
I run a very tight ship.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.664
The only ones with access
would be myself

36:07.666 --> 36:09.332
And my cleaner, mabel.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.601
And I, for one,
never left my desk.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.670
- Well, then, we'll need
to speak with your cleaner.

36:13.739 --> 36:16.673
I ran into her the morning
that mr. Knowles' body
was found.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.542
- Of course.
She's right over there.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.676
Mabel!

36:19.811 --> 36:21.410
A word?

36:21.446 --> 36:22.812
- Oh-ho-ho.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.681
This is not the woman
that I met.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.549
Do you employ
a different cleaner?

36:26.618 --> 36:28.918
- Not for the last 20 years.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.757
- The crabtrees!

36:34.793 --> 36:36.626
How delightful.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.294
Did you enjoy the armagnac?

36:38.363 --> 36:40.497
- Oh, do not play nice
with us, hathaway.

36:40.632 --> 36:43.833
We were shocked to learn
that the garden suite is not,
in fact,

36:43.835 --> 36:47.370
Your top suite and we demand
to know why you gave it
away to mr. Castle!

36:47.505 --> 36:49.105
- Yes.
We're oh so upset!

36:49.141 --> 36:51.841
And when I say "we,"
I of course mean her.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.710
- Are we not a unified front
on this?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.578
- Unified?
- Oh, good lord, george!

36:55.581 --> 36:56.913
Why did I ever marry you?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.782
- Oh, I don't know!
That's a good question!

36:58.784 --> 37:01.584
If you love the sunrise suite
so much,
perhaps you should marry it!

37:01.587 --> 37:03.520
- Nothing to see here.
Nothing to see.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.921
- Have you lost your mind like
you lost our little shovel?
- Carry on!

37:05.958 --> 37:07.990
- A loser that lost a shovel.
I'm the--
- yes!

37:08.026 --> 37:09.725
- Yes, I'm the loser of
all things, aren't I?

37:09.761 --> 37:11.594
- Yes, you lose things, george!
You're about to lose

37:11.597 --> 37:13.330
The best thing that ever
happened to you.

37:13.332 --> 37:16.332
- Oh, well, maybe that wouldn't
be such a bad thing
to lose after all!

37:18.470 --> 37:20.670
(whispering):
I didn't mean that last part.

37:23.175 --> 37:26.609
Urgent message for mr. Castle.

37:26.678 --> 37:29.112
Wadsworth is compro--
(gun clicking)

37:29.114 --> 37:31.814
- It wasn't supposed
to get messy like this.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.417
All I had to do was authorize
a room change

37:34.453 --> 37:36.152
And they would do
the dirty work.

37:36.221 --> 37:37.520
Oh, well!

37:37.556 --> 37:39.522
In for a penny, in for a pound.

37:42.227 --> 37:43.959
(both): Found the shovel!

37:43.996 --> 37:45.962
- Effie, a telegram came
through.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.231
Wadsworth is in on it.
We need to warn the king!

37:50.569 --> 37:53.369
- Yes, a much more
delicate nose.

37:56.008 --> 37:57.640
- How's this?

37:59.177 --> 38:00.777
- That's it.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.846
Let's get this picture up all
over town straight away.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.981
- That may not be necessary.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.985
That's bernadette childs.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.387
- Harvey knowles'
former partner?
- Yes.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.856
And I know where
I might find her.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.496
- Your majesty?

38:24.569 --> 38:26.202
Your majesty?

38:27.306 --> 38:30.073
- You won't be needing this
anymore.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.450
- Old habits die hard,
huh, bernadette?

38:42.554 --> 38:45.454
- Hello, llewellyn.
How'd you find me?

38:46.558 --> 38:48.958
- Every creature has
a modus operandi.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.560
Even a rat.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.395
- Is that all I am to you?

38:52.464 --> 38:53.897
A rat?

38:54.032 --> 38:56.031
I was your most valuable
informant.

38:57.235 --> 39:00.236
We had interesting
conversations, back in the day,

39:00.305 --> 39:01.938
Me and you.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.441
- And harvey knowles.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.378
Fellow con
you once called a friend.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.115
Why did you do it?

39:13.251 --> 39:15.051
- Harvey broke the golden rule.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.922
A con capitalizes on greed,
lust,

39:18.924 --> 39:21.324
Vanity,
but never human kindness.

39:21.459 --> 39:23.993
I couldn't sit by while he
and his new partner

39:23.995 --> 39:27.496
Swindled hotel guests
who were only trying to be kind.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.334
- You speaking of rules is
the very definition
of irony.

39:31.403 --> 39:33.469
- Come on, llewellyn,

39:33.505 --> 39:35.872
You once agreed
with me on this.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.675
And it wasn't just the hotel
guests harvey swindled.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.945
It was his lover,
his family... Even me.

39:43.181 --> 39:46.082
A new partner of his must
have rotted his brain.

39:46.084 --> 39:49.018
- So, that's why you switched
the syrup?

39:49.154 --> 39:51.287
So harvey would rot in a casket

39:51.356 --> 39:53.389
While his partner-in-crime
rotted in jail?

39:53.392 --> 39:55.157
- I was protecting
our livelihood.

39:55.193 --> 39:56.859
He crossed the line.

39:57.662 --> 39:59.261
There's a code.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.764
- There is, indeed.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.699
Which is why you need
to come with me.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.841
- Thank you for the gun,
mr. Crabtree.

40:11.976 --> 40:15.711
I'm so sorry you're about
to use it to unknowingly
assassinate the king.

40:15.781 --> 40:18.314
You know, I wasn't sure
what to do with you
two at first

40:18.316 --> 40:20.717
And then the perfect narrative
presented itself:

40:20.852 --> 40:23.586
An epic fight
over the sunrise suite.

40:23.721 --> 40:26.189
- That'll never work.
You'd have to kill us, too!

40:26.991 --> 40:29.225
- Precisely.
- Uh!

40:30.595 --> 40:32.929
- Your authentic bickering
is going to lend credence

40:32.998 --> 40:34.664
To my upcoming report

40:34.799 --> 40:37.066
And it's gonna confirm that
you knocked mr. Hathaway out,

40:37.202 --> 40:38.668
You stole his gun

40:38.737 --> 40:42.338
And then you went after
the man who unjustly took
your honeymoon suite.

40:43.541 --> 40:45.741
Thanks to his majesty's
famous lust for guns,

40:45.811 --> 40:47.677
It is the only logical
explanation

40:47.679 --> 40:50.480
As to why I found three
dead bodies

40:50.482 --> 40:54.083
In the unfortunate aftermath
of this shootout.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.885
(crashing sound)

41:03.762 --> 41:05.661
- You're welcome.

41:16.174 --> 41:19.442
- I owe the both of you
my eternal gratitude.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.578
I'd knight you, if I could,

41:21.713 --> 41:25.247
But, unfortunately,
I think this must be kept
under wraps.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.183
- We understand, your majesty.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.187
- I know it's not much,
but, uh,

41:32.224 --> 41:35.058
Please accept this small token
as a measure of my appreciation.

41:35.193 --> 41:37.059
- Oh my goodness!
- Oh!

41:37.128 --> 41:38.728
- Your majesty, thank you.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.863
- I've also secured you
something else.

41:40.866 --> 41:43.199
For your remaining time
at this hotel,

41:43.268 --> 41:45.668
The sunrise suite is yours.

41:45.670 --> 41:49.005
- Even better than knighthood!
(laughing)

41:49.140 --> 41:51.007
- I must say, detective,

41:51.009 --> 41:53.209
Solving a case again
was quite satisfying.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.144
- For me and you both.

41:56.481 --> 41:59.415
- Can I interest you
in a celebratory cocktail?

41:59.417 --> 42:02.484
- Alas, other plans are afoot.
- Ah!

42:02.521 --> 42:06.022
- But I do hope we get
to do this again, watts.

42:06.091 --> 42:07.723
Soon.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.159
- Yes.

42:23.308 --> 42:25.708
- Told you this suite was lucky.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.517
- Julia?

42:34.586 --> 42:36.252
William,

42:36.387 --> 42:38.321
I'm glad to see you back.

42:38.323 --> 42:41.390
- Oh, it's good to be back.

42:41.426 --> 42:43.192
- I'm sorry about before.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.860
I know how busy you are

42:44.896 --> 42:46.863
And it was just
a silly romantic notion.

42:46.998 --> 42:50.867
I should know that we can't
just bring back the past.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.803
- Oh, I wouldn't exactly
say that.

42:53.872 --> 42:55.538
(snaps fingers)

42:55.607 --> 42:57.806
(violin music plays)

43:06.184 --> 43:07.616
- William!

43:07.652 --> 43:10.252
Oysters rockefeller!

43:11.256 --> 43:13.690
Like our honeymoon dinner
in new york.

43:13.692 --> 43:17.427
- Only this time
we'll definitely
notice them arriving.

43:17.562 --> 43:19.428
- You even remembered our song.

43:19.497 --> 43:21.097
- Of course.

43:21.099 --> 43:23.166
It was the greatest night
of my life.

43:23.301 --> 43:26.969
- Well, the night is
still young.

43:30.208 --> 43:32.741
(baby fussing and crying)

43:35.947 --> 43:38.181
- She'll be fine.

43:42.587 --> 43:44.787
Subtitling: Difuze
