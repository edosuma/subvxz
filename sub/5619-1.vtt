WEBVTT

00:43.795 --> 00:45.296
Did you see what he did?

00:45.380 --> 00:46.464
Whoa!

00:46.548 --> 00:47.632
Hey! Get out of the road!

00:47.716 --> 00:49.926
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:01.938 --> 01:04.274
Look! He's a...

01:04.357 --> 01:06.234
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's happening to me.

01:06.317 --> 01:08.528
I'm just trying to get
to the hospital. Please!

01:08.611 --> 01:10.655
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:11.823 --> 01:13.575
Hands in the air! Now!

01:13.742 --> 01:15.368
We have the alien threat surrounded.

01:15.452 --> 01:18.621
Fifth between Pike and Union.
He's in our sights, ma'am.

01:18.705 --> 01:21.374
<i>Contain the subject.
Use lethal force if necessary.</i>

01:21.458 --> 01:24.836
Lethal force?
I'm not trying to do this. I need help.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.421
Stay right there, damn it! Hands up!

01:26.504 --> 01:27.756
- Okay, okay!
- Now turn around!

01:27.839 --> 01:29.507
Hands on the hood! Real slow.

01:29.632 --> 01:32.177
I'll do whatever you say,
but please don't hurt me.

01:32.302 --> 01:35.680
Honestly, I don't know
what, what, what's...

01:37.932 --> 01:39.434
Happening to me.

01:45.523 --> 01:46.941
Hey, wait a minute!

01:47.025 --> 01:48.359
Freeze!

01:48.443 --> 01:49.527
- Down on the ground!
- Get him!

01:57.827 --> 01:58.953
Where'd he go?

02:00.205 --> 02:01.331
Radio for backup!

02:03.625 --> 02:05.543
Hey, he's in the alley.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.295
Help!

02:24.229 --> 02:26.397
Hey, what's your name?

02:27.065 --> 02:28.483
Guy! What's your name?

02:28.566 --> 02:29.818
- Joey.
- Joey.

02:29.901 --> 02:31.152
Okay, my name's Daisy.
I'm with S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:31.236 --> 02:32.320
We're here for your protection.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.739
There's more on the way. First unit's
down or wetting themselves.

02:34.864 --> 02:37.075
That SUV got the point across.

02:37.909 --> 02:39.244
Joey, Joey...

02:39.327 --> 02:40.662
Joey! Stay with me, okay?

02:40.745 --> 02:43.248
I know you're scared. And your world's
being turned upside down.

02:43.373 --> 02:46.417
But believe it or not,
I've been through this, okay? I can help.

02:46.501 --> 02:47.585
We'll get you out of here.

02:47.919 --> 02:51.172
It's you who made the car
and the people and the thing...

02:51.256 --> 02:52.715
You're gonna want to stand
well clear of that, mate.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.263
Didn't I tell you?

02:58.346 --> 02:59.430
I know it's a lot to take in,

02:59.514 --> 03:01.432
but right now you have
very few options and zero time.

03:01.558 --> 03:02.600
So, please just go with it.

03:02.725 --> 03:03.768
We'll be right there with you.

03:03.893 --> 03:05.353
It's not like this day
can get any crazier, right?

03:05.436 --> 03:06.563
Right.

03:13.945 --> 03:15.613
I take that back.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.498
<i>Chemical hazard. Masks on.</i>

03:27.959 --> 03:30.628
<i>They were right here. What the hell
happened? They're gone.</i>

03:37.427 --> 03:40.805
<i>How are you holding up
in there, buddy?</i>

03:40.889 --> 03:43.266
Fine, I guess.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.894
I hope this is going
somewhere other than higher.

03:45.977 --> 03:48.813
<i>Rest easy. We're almost there.</i>

04:16.841 --> 04:19.052
We had him pinned down,
but the target has escaped.

04:19.177 --> 04:21.596
He didn't escape. He was extracted.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.141
I'll secure the area,
clean and contain the situation.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.976
Manage it without making
any more noise.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.437
There were helicopters this time,
for God's sake.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.648
It is getting harder
for this to go unnoticed.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.548
We'll leave you to it.

04:58.383 --> 05:00.510
Who are you? What is this?

05:00.593 --> 05:02.845
What is S.H.I.E.L.D.?
Did you do this to me?

05:03.554 --> 05:07.767
We try to protect people like you
from the world or from yourself,

05:07.892 --> 05:09.811
unless we have to defend
the world against you.

05:09.894 --> 05:12.939
People like me?
What is happening to me?

05:13.064 --> 05:15.984
You've experienced
what's called a biomorphic event.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.861
Short version, your DNA changed.

05:18.945 --> 05:20.238
And the long version?

05:20.363 --> 05:22.156
Is long.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.785
But right now you need to understand
that you will survive this.

05:26.411 --> 05:30.248
Okay. Okay, so...
So you guys can cure me?

05:32.250 --> 05:33.418
I'm sorry.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.962
We just learn to live with it.

05:36.087 --> 05:41.259
It may feel like your life has ended,
but it just got more interesting.

05:42.802 --> 05:46.639
More interesting?
I'm not a freaking TED Talk.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.808
Did you see the power line
hit that tanker truck?

05:48.933 --> 05:54.022
I'm literally a catastrophic meltdown.
Everything was...

05:54.105 --> 05:55.189
Wait, wait, wait. Why...

05:55.273 --> 05:56.816
Why isn't this box liquefying?

05:56.941 --> 05:59.027
Or this plane,
or whatever the hell this is.

05:59.110 --> 06:01.112
It's poly-tectic adaptive materials.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.031
Each module can be customised.

06:03.114 --> 06:06.367
So, you're safe in there
and we're safe from you.

06:06.451 --> 06:07.618
I don't feel safe.

06:07.702 --> 06:10.288
I feel like my skin's crawling
and my organs are shifting and...

06:10.413 --> 06:11.873
Joey, just take a breath.

06:11.956 --> 06:15.043
First thing you need is rest,
medically speaking.

06:15.126 --> 06:18.796
We'll be in the air for a couple
more hours, and you will be in this box.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.256
So why don't you lie down?

06:21.424 --> 06:23.634
You'll feel better after some sleep.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.810
Well, thanks, whatever your name is.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.729
Daisy.

06:34.812 --> 06:37.648
Well, thank you, Daisy, for not
letting them shoot me in the head.

06:40.777 --> 06:45.156
Uh, oh, one last thing. Do you take
vitamins every day, Joey? Fish oil?

06:46.157 --> 06:47.450
Not every day.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.329
All right. Get some rest.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.089
How's he doing?

07:01.172 --> 07:02.757
Okay, for now.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.258
Third incident already this month.

07:04.342 --> 07:06.094
But at least we were able
to get our hands on this one.

07:06.177 --> 07:08.179
The rate of new cases is increasing.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.431
We knew it would
after the initial reports.

07:10.515 --> 07:12.183
A new Inhuman could emerge anywhere

07:12.266 --> 07:14.310
without having any idea
what's happened.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.145
Only in the continental US so far.

07:16.229 --> 07:18.981
Plus this new aircraft can stay in the air
much longer than the old plane.

07:19.065 --> 07:21.400
Days, really.
So rapid response anywhere is...

07:21.526 --> 07:22.735
You love your new toy, don't you?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.362
I very much love my new toy.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.781
But even with the mind-boggling range
on this puppy...

07:26.864 --> 07:28.366
Inhumans are still disappearing.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.284
He's the first one in a while
we've been able to secure.

07:30.368 --> 07:31.786
Well, it's no mystery who's taking them.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.287
That black ops group
was there before us.

07:33.371 --> 07:34.455
- I know.
- Again.

07:34.539 --> 07:37.041
Whoever they are.
How many do you think they've taken?

07:37.125 --> 07:38.918
We know of at least five sightings,

07:39.043 --> 07:41.504
five individuals who vanished
before we could get to them.

07:41.587 --> 07:44.215
But the real mystery is
who's running that group?

07:44.882 --> 07:47.385
- Not if you did your part.
- Hmm.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.720
How'd it feel to join the paparazzi, Phil?

07:49.804 --> 07:51.806
I think I might've missed my calling.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.058
I have every body,
every piece of software

07:54.142 --> 07:56.394
tasked with identifying that woman.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.646
So we can figure out
where she's taking Inhumans

07:58.729 --> 08:01.399
and what exactly
she plans to do with them.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.775
<i>Make it top priority.</i>

08:02.900 --> 08:04.861
We'll find them.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.613
Just find out who's running them.
I'll handle the rest.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.782
Anyone in particular
I should be looking at?

08:09.907 --> 08:12.243
I have a few names.
Meanwhile, tighten your belt

08:12.326 --> 08:14.912
so they don't catch you
with your pants down again.

08:14.996 --> 08:18.291
This metamorphosis
is becoming less rare.

08:21.836 --> 08:25.256
And I don't like
that one of them got away.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.744
Hey, who the hell are you?

08:54.827 --> 08:56.412
My name's Bobbi.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.747
As in the name usually short for Robert,

08:57.830 --> 09:00.208
but in my case, Barbara,
which to me is worse.

09:00.291 --> 09:03.544
This room is all yours,
so feel free to make yourself at home.

09:03.628 --> 09:05.213
When you've changed,

09:05.296 --> 09:06.881
just put your clothing
and any personal belongings

09:06.964 --> 09:08.049
in the drawer over here for analysis.

09:08.633 --> 09:12.428
The screen will then ask you
to perform a series of medical scans.

09:12.511 --> 09:15.640
I know that you're not a huge fan
of checkups, but this will be painless.

09:16.474 --> 09:18.601
No offence, but I don't know you,

09:18.684 --> 09:21.145
so don't act like
you know a damn thing about me.

09:23.064 --> 09:26.442
I know you put off your yearly physicals
at least once every year.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.527
I know that your ex-boyfriend
was a health nut

09:28.653 --> 09:30.279
and was on you
to take better care of yourself,

09:30.363 --> 09:33.324
but it wasn't until you two broke up that
you finally got your gym membership.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.700
You've been spying on me?

09:35.368 --> 09:36.911
I looked at your Facebook page.

09:38.663 --> 09:40.915
I did see enough to know

09:40.998 --> 09:43.751
that you're generally more concerned
for others than you are for yourself.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.674
Did I hurt anyone?

09:50.675 --> 09:51.759
Probably.

09:52.843 --> 09:56.222
But there've been no reported
fatalities. Not yet, anyway.

09:56.347 --> 09:58.391
So it's a good thing.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.186
Daisy will be in soon
to give you the rundown,

10:03.020 --> 10:05.022
but know that you're not a danger
to anyone in here.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.442
And you're safe from those people
out there who were trying to hurt you.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.195
Whoever they are.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.664
<i>They're not HYDRA.
You know, I've been digging,</i>

10:21.747 --> 10:24.208
and my street sources tell me
HYDRA's gone silent.

10:24.292 --> 10:25.751
Eerily silent, yes, but...

10:25.876 --> 10:28.546
Yeah, the HYDRA finances
we track are static,

10:28.629 --> 10:29.922
no money's changing hands.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.925
And by the looks of the hardware
these gung-ho nutters are using,

10:33.050 --> 10:34.927
they're well-funded.

10:35.052 --> 10:37.388
So if this woman's not HYDRA,
what is she?

10:37.471 --> 10:38.597
Everything else.

10:38.723 --> 10:40.391
I mean, look at this, two years CIA...

10:40.474 --> 10:41.559
Is that MI6?

10:41.642 --> 10:44.437
Yeah, under which time she was
consulting with the CDC, apparently.

10:44.562 --> 10:46.063
All under different aliases.

10:46.147 --> 10:47.481
Oh, I like her.

10:47.565 --> 10:49.358
Yeah, but how are we supposed
to track down someone like this?

10:49.442 --> 10:50.943
We can't look everywhere.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.446
If we can trace that hardware,
that could give us a place to start.

10:53.571 --> 10:55.906
Take that down to Bobbi in the lab.
Have the team analyse it.

10:55.990 --> 10:57.074
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:57.158 --> 11:00.411
No, no, I'm...
I'm not going anywhere near Bobbi.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.665
Fine, I'll take it to her myself.

11:04.749 --> 11:08.336
Wouldn't want you to do anything
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

11:08.419 --> 11:09.879
Yeah, I know that's sarcasm,

11:09.962 --> 11:13.049
and I'm choosing to accept
your thoughtfulness at face value.

11:13.132 --> 11:15.092
Mack, you should head downstairs
to assist Skye with intake.

11:15.176 --> 11:17.887
- Daisy.
- Daisy, damn it.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.430
Hard for us to get used to, huh?

11:19.930 --> 11:22.183
Mmm... No, no, just you.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.686
Okay, so what do we know
about this José Gutierrez?

11:25.770 --> 11:27.063
Well, he goes by Joey.

11:27.146 --> 11:29.899
Construction foreman,
motorcycle enthusiast.

11:29.982 --> 11:32.568
Who appears to be able to liquefy
certain metals spontaneously

11:32.651 --> 11:34.070
at a distance of up to three meters.

11:34.153 --> 11:36.489
Yeah, and understandably
that development

11:36.614 --> 11:39.784
<i>has scared the living crap out of him.</i>

11:39.867 --> 11:42.453
Hey, Joey. May we come in?

11:42.536 --> 11:43.829
You're in.

11:43.954 --> 11:47.333
This is my partner, Mack.
We're just gonna talk.

11:48.042 --> 11:50.753
So, she's the greeting party
and you're the muscle, huh?

11:50.836 --> 11:52.671
Believe me, she's the muscle.

11:52.797 --> 11:54.048
He looks big and intimidating,

11:54.131 --> 11:56.842
but inside he's just a soft little,
fluffy little teddy bear.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.052
Yay.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.595
How are you feeling?

12:00.846 --> 12:03.974
Like a stranger in my own body
who I hate.

12:04.058 --> 12:06.394
Nice of you to ask.

12:07.395 --> 12:09.772
So, as I said,
this phenomenon is mostly...

12:09.855 --> 12:12.441
You know what? Lay it on me.

12:12.525 --> 12:14.819
You don't have to soften
the blows any more, thanks.

12:16.654 --> 12:18.280
All right.

12:18.364 --> 12:19.490
Um...

12:20.741 --> 12:23.244
There exists a small percentage
of the population

12:23.327 --> 12:26.163
with a dormant alien gene
mixed into their DNA.

12:26.831 --> 12:29.708
There's a chemical compound
that activates this gene,

12:29.917 --> 12:32.169
giving them unnatural abilities.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.256
Okay.

12:35.339 --> 12:37.174
This chemical compound,
called Terrigen,

12:37.258 --> 12:39.844
was recently released
into our ecosystem,

12:39.927 --> 12:42.513
and you, Joey,
are one of the first people with this gene

12:42.596 --> 12:44.849
to come into contact with it.

12:49.687 --> 12:51.021
So, I'm an alien?

12:52.523 --> 12:53.732
Part alien.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.236
Welcome to the club.

12:57.361 --> 12:59.196
We call ourselves Inhumans.

13:05.870 --> 13:07.830
Okay.

13:16.881 --> 13:18.215
All right.

13:20.718 --> 13:24.096
At least it's a, uh...
It's a good drinking story.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.182
I can't wait to tell my friends.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.225
Unfortunately,
you're gonna have to wait.

13:29.602 --> 13:30.686
What's that mean?

13:30.769 --> 13:34.940
We can't let you leave before we know
you have your abilities under control.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.942
And even then, only if we decide

13:37.067 --> 13:40.112
you're stable enough not to use them
unless absolutely necessary.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.158
And even then we...

13:44.241 --> 13:47.495
We can't let you go back
to your old life, Joe.

13:49.288 --> 13:50.372
What?

13:50.456 --> 13:53.083
I'm so sorry. It's just the reality.

13:53.167 --> 13:57.004
Wait, wait. You're not saying I can't go
and have a beer any time soon.

13:57.087 --> 14:00.466
You're saying
I can't go back to my life ever?

14:00.591 --> 14:01.967
Not in the foreseeable future.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.677
The first step is control,

14:03.761 --> 14:05.638
but then S.H.I.E.L.D. will set you up
with a new identity...

14:05.763 --> 14:08.098
I like... I like my life.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.519
It has taken me a long time to get here.

14:11.602 --> 14:15.439
To build a life where I'm actually
comfortable, much less happy.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.025
I'm not about to toss it.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.236
As a matter of fact,
now that I think about it,

14:20.319 --> 14:22.696
I'd like to get back to it right now.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.448
<i>...are unsure what to call this.</i>

14:24.532 --> 14:26.742
<i>Whether it was
a calculated alien attack</i>

14:26.825 --> 14:28.410
<i>or an experiment gone wrong.</i>

14:28.494 --> 14:32.206
<i>...get too close,
but, uh, he was a Latino guy.</i>

14:32.289 --> 14:34.542
<i>Normal.
Had this crazy look in his eyes.</i>

14:35.167 --> 14:36.627
<i>A manhunt is underway.</i>

14:36.710 --> 14:38.879
<i>Authorities are asking
witnesses to come forward</i>

14:39.046 --> 14:40.798
<i>with any information
that could lead to the capture...</i>

14:40.881 --> 14:44.510
The world's been a little twitchy
since Sokovia fell out of the sky.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.428
Right now,
your apartment is being torn apart

14:46.512 --> 14:48.264
and your relatives are being questioned.

14:48.347 --> 14:49.640
So I need to get to them before...

14:49.723 --> 14:53.352
Your best-case scenario out there is,
that black ops group kills you quick

14:53.477 --> 14:55.854
before you bring a building down
on someone.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.940
S.H.I.E.L.D. is your best option.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.108
Let me the hell out of here.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.818
- Calm down.
- Let me out!

15:00.901 --> 15:03.529
Joey, you will lose control
if you don't calm down.

15:03.654 --> 15:04.822
- Let me out! Let me...
- Joey, stop!

15:18.586 --> 15:20.129
New readings on the Monolith?

15:20.212 --> 15:22.590
Nope, that was Daisy
firing a warning shot.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.634
No new readings, no new anything
on the Monolith in months.

15:25.718 --> 15:28.846
I mean, Fitz even stopped sending
automated probes into that room.

15:28.929 --> 15:33.475
No one's set foot in there
since Simmons was swallowed up by it.

15:33.559 --> 15:35.019
This was fish oil again?

15:35.102 --> 15:36.895
What can I say?
We pulled the product off shelves,

15:37.021 --> 15:39.565
but we can't track down
every bottle sold.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.233
The good news,
if you wanna call it that...

15:41.358 --> 15:43.694
The deadly metallic elements
sank to the bottom.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.989
So the chemical contaminating
the sea life isn't deadly to humans,

15:47.072 --> 15:49.867
just game-changing for Inhumans.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.076
The bad news...

15:51.201 --> 15:53.996
It's not just in the fish oil.
Where else could it have spread?

15:54.079 --> 15:55.331
Other sea life.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.833
With ocean currents,
it's dispersed into the ecosystem.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.501
I need to know
how wide a range we're talking.

15:59.585 --> 16:02.004
Fitz and I have the team
working on a computer simulation.

16:02.087 --> 16:04.548
That biology degree
is finally coming in handy, huh?

16:04.632 --> 16:06.925
Leaving me stuck staring at screens
in here for all eternity.

16:07.051 --> 16:08.802
I get it. Rehab's a bitch.

16:08.886 --> 16:12.681
At least you're not hoping
your knee will grow back.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.808
Sorry, I'm just frustrated.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.644
Simulation's taking a while.

16:16.727 --> 16:19.688
Have Fitz look into this, too. If we can
figure out where it came from...

16:19.772 --> 16:21.315
We could narrow the search
on the mystery girl.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.650
I'm sure she'd prefer "mystery woman."

16:22.733 --> 16:25.736
- Oh, and by the way, where is he?
- Fitz?

16:25.819 --> 16:28.113
He requested yesterday to do
some research at S.H.I.E.L.D. archives,

16:28.238 --> 16:29.323
but I haven't seen him all day.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.491
I'll call him in.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.576
He's chasing down
one last lead on the Monolith.

16:32.660 --> 16:33.994
He's had a lot of last leads.

16:34.078 --> 16:35.162
I know.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.914
With him, I... I just try to...

16:36.997 --> 16:38.082
We all do.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.376
But I'd rather have him
with his head in the game

16:40.459 --> 16:41.710
than banging it against a wall.

16:41.794 --> 16:42.920
I'll call him in.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.463
Thank you.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.096
<i>Go for Fitz.</i>

16:52.179 --> 16:53.263
You need to come in.

16:53.347 --> 16:55.474
Coulson has some weaponry
he wants you to examine. It's pressing.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.184
You can handle that, though, yeah?

16:57.267 --> 16:59.186
For a biologist,
you're pretty good with forensics.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.188
Fitz, I can't cover for you any more.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.357
<i>I'll get started,
but you need to get in here.</i>

17:03.440 --> 17:04.733
We need you here.

17:04.817 --> 17:05.901
Yeah, I'll head back there in a minute.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.152
I just need to check out one last thing.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.654
Soon, all right?

17:08.779 --> 17:11.490
Yeah, copy that.
Call me if you hit a snag.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.873
Just one last thing.

17:34.722 --> 17:36.056
Should be down that way.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.354
Mister?

17:43.522 --> 17:46.024
A man like you
should not go to that place alone.

17:46.150 --> 17:47.693
Though I will not go with you.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.987
Okay, just stay close.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.845
We speak English, my friend,

18:14.928 --> 18:17.014
but you do not speak Arabic.

18:18.348 --> 18:19.683
I'm looking for Yusef Hadad.

18:19.767 --> 18:22.978
Is he here? I'd like to see him.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.938
But does Yusef want to see you?

18:25.606 --> 18:27.733
I'm fairly certain
he's gonna want what's in this case.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.526
Let me take a look, huh? I'll decide.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.070
No. Ah, I wanna see Yusef.
You understand?

18:32.196 --> 18:34.072
Or is your English
worse than you think?

18:36.450 --> 18:38.035
Suit yourself.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.708
We lost Fitz again, huh?

18:44.792 --> 18:46.335
He out there
chasing down another ghost story?

18:46.418 --> 18:47.836
He has a theory.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.004
He's always got a new theory.

18:49.087 --> 18:51.340
That's why I locked up that damn rock
and won't let anyone in.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.383
He wouldn't dare go in there.
He's not totally irrational.

18:53.467 --> 18:55.260
The process of digging
just helps him cope.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.553
No, it keeps him from coping.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.723
Look, I love the fact
that he won't give up hope. I do.

18:59.807 --> 19:02.851
But the man's a scientist.
And the evidence is pointing one way.

19:02.935 --> 19:07.397
I know. But I'm not gonna have
this talk with him. Are you?

19:11.276 --> 19:12.820
So, let him dig.

19:15.489 --> 19:16.740
Fire in the hole!

19:21.453 --> 19:23.789
Without him, I need your eyes on this.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.251
Well, it's a prototype.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.585
That's what I was thinking.

19:28.669 --> 19:29.753
Palm detection in the handle.

19:29.837 --> 19:30.963
I had to bypass it, yeah.

19:31.088 --> 19:34.299
Liquid helium-cooled,
titanium barrel and slide.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.927
If you ask me, it looks like
an emerging technologies design,

19:37.010 --> 19:38.136
DARPA maybe.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.304
Yeah, that's what I thought.

19:40.681 --> 19:42.432
So, you didn't need
my damn eyes on this at all, huh?

19:43.100 --> 19:46.103
No, I... Yes, thank you.

19:47.479 --> 19:50.232
We can run some surveillance
on known DARPA facilities.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.441
Could be black-market.

19:51.525 --> 19:53.944
You should ask Hunter to contact
the back-alley traders he knows.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.196
Hunter's not talking to me.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.160
You know why?

20:02.786 --> 20:04.121
I do.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.664
I hope you know what you're doing,

20:05.789 --> 20:07.708
and this doesn't end
in complete disaster.

20:07.791 --> 20:12.045
Team's fallen apart enough as it is.
We can't afford any more trouble.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.800
If you want to see Yusef, let's go.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.557
So, we tried to open this case of yours,

20:23.640 --> 20:27.644
but as you can see, we could not.

20:29.146 --> 20:31.481
We'd like you to do that for us now.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.193
I'll open and give you
what's inside, no problem.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.572
But only in exchange
for something in your possession.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.866
How about in exchange for your life?

20:49.875 --> 20:51.501
No deal.

20:53.337 --> 20:54.880
A man with nothing to lose.

20:55.005 --> 20:56.798
Okay, listen,
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.

20:56.882 --> 20:58.842
I've already lost a friend.

20:58.926 --> 21:00.636
And it may sound strange,
but to get her back

21:00.719 --> 21:03.138
I need to understand the properties
of an ancient monolith.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.182
Now, I've learnt
it was buried in the Yucatan

21:05.265 --> 21:07.392
after being dragged around the Earth
for a few hundred years.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.937
And originally
found where there were artefacts,

21:10.020 --> 21:12.189
mostly worthless, except one.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.358
A scroll casing, over 1,000 years old.

21:14.942 --> 21:17.569
The casing holds a parchment
which reportedly

21:17.694 --> 21:20.906
describes exactly what this monolith is,
which is what I want to know.

21:21.031 --> 21:23.742
And I tracked the scroll casing,
not easy,

21:23.867 --> 21:26.244
through history,
to Mosul's Central Museum in Iraq.

21:26.370 --> 21:28.455
But it was taken
by your extremist buddies

21:28.538 --> 21:29.831
when they ransacked
the place this year.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.000
Now I'm 90% sure it's in this room.

21:32.084 --> 21:34.795
So, you can either hand it over
in exchange for what's in there,

21:34.878 --> 21:38.757
or you can spill my guts on the sand
and use the briefcase as a booster seat.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.637
It's totally your call.

22:11.581 --> 22:12.749
Now,

22:13.333 --> 22:14.793
open the case.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.731
Are these splinter bombs?

22:35.814 --> 22:37.524
The very same used in the UN attack.

22:37.607 --> 22:38.650
And used to kill Sunil Bakshi.

22:38.775 --> 22:40.777
That name should mean
something to you.

22:40.861 --> 22:43.321
One of these killed him?

22:43.447 --> 22:45.866
Yeah. Separated his atoms,
leaving no remains.

22:47.951 --> 22:50.454
This woman you went to
all this trouble for,

22:51.788 --> 22:54.207
you love her, yeah?

22:55.876 --> 22:57.294
Yeah.

22:59.129 --> 23:02.674
Only love can make a man so stupid.

23:06.136 --> 23:07.804
No remains, you said, huh?

23:08.722 --> 23:10.474
Should be easy to clean up.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.026
What are you doing?
Come back. Stop!

23:31.578 --> 23:32.662
<i>He's going nuts.</i>

23:33.330 --> 23:34.915
Joey's having a tough time.

23:34.998 --> 23:36.166
The change is hard enough physically.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.335
But emotionally, it's a whole other thing.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.670
And I tried talking him down,
but I blew it in there.

23:40.754 --> 23:43.256
And Mack is not exactly
coming off as a teddy bear.

23:43.340 --> 23:45.050
You just told the guy I'm a teddy bear.

23:45.175 --> 23:47.719
And then you told him best case
scenario was his head blown off.

23:47.928 --> 23:49.012
Hmm.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.056
I need help.

23:51.181 --> 23:53.683
And there's one person
who's better at that than anyone.

23:54.518 --> 23:57.354
Lincoln?
You really want to go there again?

23:57.437 --> 23:58.605
He could help with intake.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.023
Plus he understands physical change.

24:00.107 --> 24:01.233
He's a doctor.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.652
Whereas we don't even know
what medical treatments to give.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.321
Last time you tried to sell him on it
he wasn't exactly buying.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.365
I'd like to try again.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.742
Mack, what's your take?

24:12.702 --> 24:15.038
I voiced my feelings
about letting Lincoln roam free.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.082
I'd gladly drag him in here
where he can't hurt anyone.

24:17.207 --> 24:21.378
But if Daisy can talk him in,
he might actually do some good.

24:22.129 --> 24:24.756
Both of you go.
Requisition a flight team and a Quinjet.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.055
Hey, Coulson, got her.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.017
Weapon is a DARPA prototype.

24:36.101 --> 24:38.770
We tapped surveillance at multiple
DARPA facilities. Got a hit.

24:38.895 --> 24:41.481
The DC branch office.
She visits every few days.

24:41.565 --> 24:44.109
A routine. Tell me there's
a window where we can get to her.

24:44.234 --> 24:45.402
It's a small one.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.530
<i>Every night she visits,
she leaves at approximately 9:00 p.m.</i>

24:48.613 --> 24:50.198
<i>with a small security detail.</i>

24:50.282 --> 24:52.576
<i>They're all three dropped
at the metro station on Twelfth,</i>

24:52.659 --> 24:53.952
<i>half an hour later.</i>

24:54.077 --> 24:56.621
<i>Her escorts buy her a coffee
on the walk to the platform.</i>

24:56.746 --> 25:00.500
<i>But she boards the 9:35 train alone.</i>

25:00.584 --> 25:04.504
<i>Sits in the middle,
drinks her coffee and answers e-mails.</i>

25:04.588 --> 25:07.257
<i>It's the only time she's alone all day.</i>

25:13.763 --> 25:16.016
You're not an easy person to pin down.

25:16.099 --> 25:19.519
Really?
'Cause you were no trouble at all.

25:31.781 --> 25:34.034
Sir, I have trouble counting
without using my fingers,

25:34.117 --> 25:36.786
but I think there's more of them than us.

25:36.870 --> 25:38.538
Roger that. Thanks, Hunter.

25:38.622 --> 25:39.789
I would have sent a car,

25:39.873 --> 25:42.083
but then you would have
suspected something, Mr Coulson.

25:42.167 --> 25:46.713
And what should I call you?
Mrs Kinley? Ms McBride?

25:46.796 --> 25:48.006
So many stage names to choose from.

25:48.131 --> 25:49.424
Call me Rosalind.

25:49.507 --> 25:52.219
Rosalind. I know
that's the name you went by at NASA.

25:52.302 --> 25:55.430
At NASA they tend to stick
to last names, actually.

25:55.513 --> 25:58.934
That whole East Coast flight school
mentality is so deeply embedded.

25:59.017 --> 26:01.269
And yet you somehow came to it
through the DOD.

26:01.353 --> 26:03.605
Space Exploration
and the Defence Department

26:03.688 --> 26:05.523
no longer eat at separate tables.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.400
But they also don't like to share recipes.

26:07.484 --> 26:11.947
You tend to vanish, then materialise
within the walls of a rival agency.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.281
I feel like I'm talking to a ghost.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.325
Whereas I'm talking to a corpse.

26:17.369 --> 26:19.079
You're not the only one
who did the homework.

26:19.162 --> 26:20.205
I guess not.

26:20.330 --> 26:23.625
In the eyes of the public,
S.H.I.E.L.D. no longer exists.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.043
And you were killed long before

26:25.168 --> 26:27.379
the agency you worked for
was pronounced dead.

26:28.421 --> 26:31.132
Yet, somehow you both
rise from the ashes.

26:31.216 --> 26:33.843
If I wasn't so intrigued,
I'd be terrified.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.887
I got a feeling nothing scares you.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.472
Not true.

26:37.555 --> 26:41.184
But I'm certainly not intimidated
by you staking out my route home,

26:41.268 --> 26:44.187
resorting to KGB-style tactics
of intimidation.

26:44.271 --> 26:45.438
I wouldn't know.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.107
I haven't spent as much time
as you have

26:47.190 --> 26:48.733
working with
Russian counter-intelligence.

26:48.858 --> 26:52.612
And I haven't spent any time in Tahiti,
though I hear it's a magical place.

26:55.699 --> 26:58.868
Let's both agree
that we enjoy a good secret.

26:58.952 --> 27:01.663
Though mine do appear
a bit old hat next to yours.

27:01.746 --> 27:05.083
Got to get with the times, Roz.
You don't want to be left in the dust.

27:05.208 --> 27:08.503
That's why I plan to detain you.
So it stops happening.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.839
Two teams in position
at the next stop, ma'am.

27:10.922 --> 27:12.465
That's one team for each of us.

27:13.049 --> 27:15.051
Again, killing it with the math.

27:15.135 --> 27:19.055
But I do hope that we can continue this
conversation in a more intimate setting.

27:19.139 --> 27:20.724
I'm perfectly happy
to answer any questions

27:20.807 --> 27:22.225
that might be bothering you now.

27:22.309 --> 27:24.811
Incarceration doesn't
seem totally necessary.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.105
Nice of you to be so accommodating.

27:27.230 --> 27:30.066
Then, tell me,

27:30.483 --> 27:32.235
where are you hiding them?

27:36.614 --> 27:38.116
You finish your rounds, Lincoln?

27:38.241 --> 27:39.284
I'm trying.

27:39.409 --> 27:42.454
The patient in 305 is a bit of a talker,
I hear.

27:53.340 --> 27:55.759
What are you doing here?
I said to leave me alone.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.677
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.721
We need your help.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.598
I told you, I don't know anything
about that damn rock.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.893
I'm sorry what happened to your friend,
but all I heard was that it's lethal.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.771
It's not the Monolith.
We found a new Inhuman.

28:08.646 --> 28:11.024
He's not the first,
and you know there'll be more.

28:11.107 --> 28:14.402
No one is better at helping
these people transition than you.

28:14.486 --> 28:15.653
You taught me that it's a gift.

28:15.779 --> 28:17.530
I was wrong.

28:17.614 --> 28:20.116
I was regurgitating a lie
they shoved down my throat.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.411
It's a curse.
You of all people should know that.

28:23.495 --> 28:25.372
Look, I get that you're trying to
build a life here, but...

28:25.455 --> 28:28.958
Yes, a normal life.
So stay out of it, please.

28:29.042 --> 28:30.168
But our heritage...

28:30.293 --> 28:31.628
Let it die.

28:32.462 --> 28:35.048
You're not walking out of here until
my partner has said her piece.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.634
I think I've made it pretty clear

28:37.717 --> 28:40.345
I'm not taking orders
from anyone any more.

28:40.470 --> 28:42.097
<i>These altered humans are a threat,</i>

28:42.180 --> 28:44.474
and I'm in charge
of neutralising that threat.

28:44.557 --> 28:47.185
"By any means necessary"
sounds like it's coming next.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.603
And who do you answer to?

28:48.686 --> 28:51.940
Mr Coulson,
it's others who answer to me.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.942
The laws of nature have changed,

28:54.025 --> 28:56.986
and until the laws of man
change to reflect that,

28:57.070 --> 28:58.863
we can only do what we feel is right.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.032
I agree. I think.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.450
I know you do.

29:02.534 --> 29:05.328
So I understand the trail of bodies
you're leaving behind.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.832
The dead ones I won't hold against you,
it's the ones you're sheltering that I...

29:08.915 --> 29:11.084
Dead ones? I haven't killed anyone.

29:11.876 --> 29:13.920
We've had some vanish
before we could secure them.

29:14.003 --> 29:16.923
Then how do you explain
the carcasses we've recovered?

29:17.006 --> 29:18.716
Blasted with some sort of
energy weapon?

29:18.842 --> 29:21.010
- That's not us.
- It's not us either.

29:21.678 --> 29:24.889
Wait, is this still cagey banter, or are
we being honest all of a sudden?

29:25.014 --> 29:27.851
If you're not killing these individuals,
then who is?

29:27.934 --> 29:29.269
Get your hand off me!

29:29.352 --> 29:30.728
You better watch your tone.

29:30.854 --> 29:31.938
You're lucky we haven't dragged you in

29:32.021 --> 29:33.481
for that crap you pulled
on the aircraft carrier.

29:33.565 --> 29:34.691
Mack...

29:34.774 --> 29:37.360
I saw the men you took down.
They barely recovered.

29:37.444 --> 29:39.154
Then you know what I'm capable of.

29:39.237 --> 29:40.405
I'm not scared of you.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.866
You should be.

29:42.949 --> 29:46.077
Whoa. Lincoln, cool down.

29:46.786 --> 29:47.912
This isn't me.

29:54.794 --> 29:55.837
Stop.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.297
Stop right there.

30:00.133 --> 30:02.260
Tell me
where to find the Inhuman.

30:02.385 --> 30:03.595
I don't know.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.490
Never mind.

30:49.516 --> 30:51.768
We have to hit this thing
with everything we've got.

30:51.851 --> 30:55.605
And I need a bigger gun I guess.
Or my axe.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.649
Or maybe a shotgun-axe
combination of some sort.

30:58.816 --> 31:01.986
Oh, we going in here?
Yeah, that makes sense.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.281
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

31:13.873 --> 31:17.460
If we're both getting the call,
then I think we know what it's about.

31:17.544 --> 31:20.838
You'll have to excuse me.

31:25.468 --> 31:28.846
If you don't take it out of my pocket,
it's just gonna ring like that forever.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.750
I guess you guys
didn't do all your homework.

31:57.834 --> 32:02.005
That many! In a hospital?
How close is the response team?

33:04.067 --> 33:05.193
He's gone!

33:05.276 --> 33:06.903
<i>Contain the alien threats at all costs.</i>

33:06.986 --> 33:09.238
<i>Use lethal force if necessary.</i>

33:10.281 --> 33:11.324
Come with us.

33:11.407 --> 33:13.284
We'll keep you safe.
Your life is in danger.

33:13.409 --> 33:14.577
My life is in ruins.

33:15.662 --> 33:17.538
- Lincoln!
- Daisy! Daisy, he's on his own.

33:17.622 --> 33:19.540
We got to get you out of here.
They're hunting you too.

33:19.624 --> 33:21.417
Come on, let's go!

33:35.640 --> 33:37.475
Want to tell me
why you're not speaking to me?

33:41.145 --> 33:42.271
Because

33:44.440 --> 33:46.609
you're not supposed to see the bride
on the wedding day.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.201
So are we gonna do this or what?

33:55.284 --> 33:57.704
I asked for the ring back
because I paid for it.

33:57.787 --> 34:00.123
Not as a meaningful gesture
of any kind.

34:00.206 --> 34:03.084
But thanks,
oh, great master of melodrama.

34:03.167 --> 34:04.794
Right, because it wasn't
at all melodramatic

34:04.877 --> 34:06.629
when you whispered, on your death bed,

34:06.713 --> 34:08.172
"I can't do this any more."

34:09.047 --> 34:10.466
I meant pretend not to...

34:12.467 --> 34:13.678
You know.

34:15.138 --> 34:16.597
I didn't mean
that we should make the tragic mistake

34:16.681 --> 34:18.349
of marrying each other. Again.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.601
Call it what you will,

34:21.686 --> 34:23.688
but you've got the ring
you once threw in my face

34:23.813 --> 34:25.606
and we're shagging on the regular,

34:25.690 --> 34:28.109
so the only thing missing
is a piece of paper.

34:28.192 --> 34:30.527
And your ring.
Not that you know where it is.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.655
I know exactly where it is.

34:32.739 --> 34:34.322
I just don't personally own

34:34.407 --> 34:36.826
the scuba diving equipment
to retrieve it.

34:38.703 --> 34:41.664
You don't care about the money.
That ring is cheap-ass.

34:42.498 --> 34:46.668
I wanted something to hold onto,
if your mind really is made up.

34:49.255 --> 34:52.175
I'm going after him, Bob.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.384
Coulson's given me the green light.

34:53.509 --> 34:56.304
I've chased down all the HYDRA intel
I can from on high.

34:56.387 --> 34:58.347
If my hunch is right,
I need to get to ground.

34:58.431 --> 35:01.184
We agreed that you'd wait
till I was 100%.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.603
I mean, every day I'm pushing myself,
getting better, stronger.

35:03.686 --> 35:04.771
A few more weeks...

35:04.854 --> 35:05.980
I'll be better without you.

35:06.063 --> 35:09.025
On my old turf, calling in favours,
whatever it takes.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.402
I'm gonna hunt
that son-of-a-bitch down.

35:18.743 --> 35:19.786
It's on.

35:19.869 --> 35:20.912
<i>Good evening.</i>

35:21.037 --> 35:25.249
<i>I'm here tonight to address
growing concerns among our citizens</i>

35:25.374 --> 35:29.629
<i>of the threats we face
that are not of this world.</i>

35:29.796 --> 35:33.633
<i>I don't need to remind people of
the catastrophes in New York, London</i>

35:33.716 --> 35:36.260
<i>and most recently, Sokovia.</i>

35:36.385 --> 35:39.680
<i>Tragedies that seem to be
growing in number and scale,</i>

35:39.764 --> 35:43.559
<i>and the organisation we had in place
to protect us, S.H.I.E.L.D.,</i>

35:43.643 --> 35:48.147
<i>brought airships raining down
in our nation's capital.</i>

35:48.231 --> 35:50.983
<i>Every day
new dangers present themselves,</i>

35:51.067 --> 35:53.611
<i>filling our peaceful streets with chaos.</i>

35:53.736 --> 35:54.737
Bigger.

35:55.154 --> 35:59.116
<i>By executive order,
I have created a special task force</i>

35:59.242 --> 36:02.328
<i>to neutralise
these alien threats on our soil.</i>

36:02.411 --> 36:06.249
<i>The Advanced Threat
Containment Unit, or ATCU...</i>

36:06.582 --> 36:12.380
<i>...will be given full licence to act with
whatever authority is necessary.</i>

36:12.463 --> 36:15.341
<i>The laws of nature have changed,</i>

36:15.424 --> 36:18.427
<i>and until the laws of man
change to reflect that,</i>

36:18.511 --> 36:20.888
<i>we must do what we feel is right.</i>

36:20.972 --> 36:22.974
People really
do answer to you, don't they?

36:25.101 --> 36:27.103
<i>Mr President,
how do you respond to reports</i>

36:27.186 --> 36:28.729
<i>that the recent incidents are in fact</i>

36:28.813 --> 36:30.731
<i>due to the spread of
an alien contagion?</i>

36:30.815 --> 36:33.109
<i>These are rumours. They are not true.</i>

36:33.192 --> 36:36.195
<i>They are fabrications meant to
boost ratings and cause hysteria.</i>

36:36.279 --> 36:41.325
<i>Any and all possibilities are being
taken very seriously by the ATCU.</i>

36:41.450 --> 36:44.537
<i>But if this is an outbreak,
shouldn't the public be made aware?</i>

36:44.620 --> 36:48.207
<i>I think we should be careful of
the words we start throwing around.</i>

36:48.291 --> 36:51.919
<i>The last thing we need
is panic in the streets.</i>

36:52.003 --> 36:55.339
<i>Any threat will be eliminated,
I can assure you.</i>

36:55.464 --> 36:57.967
<i>People have a right
to know, are the infected among us?</i>

36:58.050 --> 37:00.678
<i>Thank you. That'll be all for today.</i>

37:03.556 --> 37:05.892
I've lived with a secret before.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.812
I was miserable until I came out with it.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.773
This secret,

37:12.857 --> 37:14.817
the world's not ready to hear.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.091
I've been waiting for a while.

37:39.175 --> 37:40.718
Had to be done. It's my last shot.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.511
What's supposed to be in there?

37:42.595 --> 37:43.638
The answer.

37:43.721 --> 37:46.015
You've thought
you've had the answers before.

37:46.098 --> 37:49.393
I think you've considered
every possible answer

37:49.518 --> 37:50.686
except the obvious one.

37:51.896 --> 37:54.315
You thought Simmons
was trapped inside the Monolith.

37:54.398 --> 37:58.277
But every instrument's scan showed
the stone was solid all the way through.

37:58.361 --> 38:00.696
After hearing about
the Pym Technologies disaster,

38:00.780 --> 38:03.824
you even thought she'd been
reduced to a microscopic level.

38:03.908 --> 38:07.870
But no evidence supported that.
And now...

38:07.954 --> 38:10.581
And now I think...

38:10.706 --> 38:13.042
I know it's a black hole.

38:13.125 --> 38:16.295
It's dark matter made solid.
It can warp space-time. It...

38:16.879 --> 38:19.048
Look, regardless, okay,

38:19.131 --> 38:23.302
this is gonna tell us exactly
what that monolith is. So...

38:34.480 --> 38:36.315
Should we scan it?

38:36.399 --> 38:38.067
See if the computer
can decipher what those...

38:38.150 --> 38:39.318
It's Hebrew.

38:40.069 --> 38:41.570
It's just one word.

38:44.448 --> 38:45.616
What does it mean?

38:48.244 --> 38:49.662
Death.

38:57.253 --> 39:00.881
Fitz, I'm gonna make
the trip to Sheffield.

39:00.965 --> 39:04.010
Jemma's family deserves to know
that she's MIA.

39:04.093 --> 39:06.387
- Ah...
- They need to be able to move on,

39:06.470 --> 39:09.140
and so do we.

39:09.265 --> 39:12.059
You have shown so much heart,
never giving up on Simmons,

39:12.143 --> 39:14.562
and I will always,
always respect you for it.

39:14.645 --> 39:17.898
But look around. We need you.

39:17.982 --> 39:22.820
We need that big brain of yours
and that heart here, okay?

39:23.779 --> 39:28.409
I miss her too. I'm having
a hard time accepting it. All of it.

39:28.492 --> 39:32.038
I'm on my third hand,
but nothing feels normal

39:32.121 --> 39:34.707
because nothing will feel normal.

39:34.790 --> 39:37.209
May took off on vacation
and never came back,

39:37.293 --> 39:38.502
so I lost my right hand too.

39:38.627 --> 39:40.629
We have got to accept it.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.132
To say goodbye.

39:47.136 --> 39:49.930
We need to say goodbye.

39:50.014 --> 39:52.224
Jemma would want us to do that.

39:53.559 --> 39:54.977
Okay?

39:59.648 --> 40:01.233
Okay.

40:14.705 --> 40:15.748
Oh...

41:06.715 --> 41:08.092
Do something.

41:13.139 --> 41:14.890
Do something!

41:19.395 --> 41:20.813
Do something!

41:23.232 --> 41:25.317
Do something!
