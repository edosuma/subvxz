Where are you?

02:55.248 --> 02:56.615
I really thought,
after elimination,

we'd all hug Autumn,

07:31.124 --> 07:32.558
Make it like a sweet
and sour or something or...

07:32.626 --> 07:33.626
That's a great idea.

07:33.693 --> 07:34.893
You two together,
you two together,

07:34.961 --> 07:36.061
and us two together.

07:37.964 --> 07:39.098
We're gonna do, like,
a nice sausage,

07:39.165 --> 07:40.599
and we're gonna
garnish it with prunes.

07:40.667 --> 07:41.934
It's the best thing.

07:42.002 --> 07:43.369
Now you get to cooking.

07:43.436 --> 07:45.270
See you back down in the kitchen
in five minutes, yes?

07:45.338 --> 07:46.205
(All)
Yes, Chef.

07:46.272 --> 07:47.706
Hurry it up!

07:50.744 --> 07:52.044
<i>(Announcer)
After a fast cleanup...</i>

07:52.112 --> 07:53.646
Let's go!

07:53.713 --> 07:55.180
Okay, guys,
fourty-five minutes from now.

07:55.248 --> 07:56.882
<i>(Announcer) the teams begin
their work in pairs,</i>

07:56.950 --> 07:59.018
<i>creating three stunning
pork dishes.</i>

07:59.085 --> 08:01.186
How we doing on that pork?
Okay?

08:01.254 --> 08:02.755
Looking good.

08:02.822 --> 08:04.223
<i>(Announcer) Chef Ramsay
is expecting the teams</i>

08:04.290 --> 08:05.991
<i>to match the appropriate
side ingredient</i>

08:06.059 --> 08:07.726
<i>with the right cut of pork.</i>

08:07.794 --> 08:09.294
That's not done.

08:09.362 --> 08:11.130
Make sure it's cooked through.
That's all.

08:11.197 --> 08:13.098
I haven't worked with any of
the ladies yet on the red team,

08:13.166 --> 08:14.800
so it might be important for me
to just kind of stand back.

08:14.868 --> 08:18.737
I'll take control
of the soup completely.

08:18.805 --> 08:20.372
Kind of sit back and watch
how everybody works.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.641
How are you guys doing
over there on the prunes?

08:22.709 --> 08:23.676
You gonna try
and fry them?

08:23.743 --> 08:25.244
Okay.

08:25.311 --> 08:26.712
That's brilliant.

08:26.780 --> 08:29.114
Scott's definitely got
a little bit of Autumn in him.

08:29.182 --> 08:31.083
I'd say take it out now,
wrap it in foil, let it rest.

08:31.151 --> 08:32.351
- I say another minute.
- Do another minute then.

08:32.419 --> 08:33.919
He needs to stop trying
to put his two cents

08:33.986 --> 08:35.187
into everything.

08:35.255 --> 08:36.655
Scott, are you
running the red team now?

08:36.722 --> 08:39.124
I'm just offering advice,
Chef, that's all.

08:39.192 --> 08:40.893
<i>(Announcer) While Scott
is quickly making a name for himself</i>

08:40.960 --> 08:42.027

08:43.328 --> 08:44.963
<i>Autumn already
has a nickname.</i>

08:50.136 --> 08:52.905
Where are you guys'
tasting spoon?

08:52.972 --> 08:53.972
Right now,
I'm an outsider.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.374
They don't know me
very well.

08:55.442 --> 08:57.342
Anyone see
the tasting spoon?

08:59.212 --> 09:01.080
I just have to get comfortable
with my team,

09:01.147 --> 09:03.582
and I think we'll be able
to work together really well.

09:03.650 --> 09:05.417
I'm gonna make
a honey mustard, then.

09:07.287 --> 09:08.187
Well, just a little bit
of mustard?

09:08.254 --> 09:10.189
It'll be really tasty.

09:10.256 --> 09:13.258
<i>(Announcer) While Autumn

09:13.326 --> 09:14.960

<i>(Announcer)

09:17.497 --> 09:18.597
Is it supposed to be mushy?

09:18.665 --> 09:20.299
Yeah.

09:20.366 --> 09:21.867
I've never cooked
with blood sausage.

09:21.935 --> 09:23.635
Fran never
cooked with blood sausage.

09:23.703 --> 09:26.405
It was all nasty and brown
and black looking.

09:26.473 --> 09:28.073
Where's your sausage at,
guys?

09:28.141 --> 09:29.274
In the oven.

09:29.342 --> 09:30.476
Pull it out real quick
and just make sure

09:30.543 --> 09:31.777
it's not blowing up.

09:31.845 --> 09:32.978
Oh, [bleep] me!

09:34.581 --> 09:36.749
It just bust.

09:36.816 --> 09:37.649
You're supposed to prick it
before you cook it.

09:37.717 --> 09:38.650
Damn it!

09:40.253 --> 09:42.387
Last minute, guys!

09:42.455 --> 09:44.223
I'm so not happy
with this.

09:44.290 --> 09:45.224
Beautiful, beautiful.

09:45.291 --> 09:46.692
Go... go, go, go, go.

09:46.760 --> 09:47.693
Wipe your rim, Fran!

09:47.761 --> 09:49.394
Here, Fran!

09:49.462 --> 09:51.597
(Gordon)
Three, two, one!

09:51.664 --> 09:52.498
Stop!

09:53.967 --> 09:55.701
Okay, let's go.

09:55.769 --> 09:58.337
<i>(Announcer)
Up first, Nilka and Fran's dish</i>

09:58.404 --> 10:01.306
<i>will face off against
Benjamin and Ed's.</i>

10:01.374 --> 10:02.941
What's your dish?

10:03.009 --> 10:04.510
We have the blood sausage

10:04.577 --> 10:05.577
with a prune puree.

10:05.645 --> 10:06.845
Already, you look negative.

10:06.913 --> 10:08.013
I'm not pleased
with the plate.

10:08.081 --> 10:08.981
That's why
I don't look happy.

10:09.048 --> 10:11.283
I'm really, really not.

10:11.351 --> 10:12.851
[grunting]

10:15.822 --> 10:17.189
Blech.

10:19.726 --> 10:22.294
Who in the [bleep] chose prune
with blood sausage?

10:24.430 --> 10:26.098
Talk to me, red team!

10:28.101 --> 10:29.768
You're gonna do
like a nice sausage,

10:29.836 --> 10:31.336
and we're gonna garnish it
with prunes.

10:31.404 --> 10:33.172
It's the best thing.

10:33.239 --> 10:35.374
(Fran) It was his decision
to put those items

10:35.441 --> 10:36.875
onto the plate.

10:36.943 --> 10:39.011
And Scott's trying
not to own up to it.

10:40.346 --> 10:41.880
And it went
completely wrong.

10:41.948 --> 10:43.849
Understatement of the year.

10:43.917 --> 10:44.983
I knew it.

10:45.051 --> 10:46.318
I'd just rather
had went up there

10:46.386 --> 10:47.786
with an empty plate like,
"Voila, Chef."

10:47.854 --> 10:49.354
That's a [bleep] disaster.

10:49.422 --> 10:51.290
Doh!

10:51.357 --> 10:53.125
All right, Benjamin.
What is that?

10:53.193 --> 10:54.660
Pan-roasted pork loin,

10:54.727 --> 10:55.928
rissoled with thyme,
star anise,

10:55.995 --> 10:57.462
and baby bok choy.

10:57.530 --> 10:59.998
The dish that we did
was a beautiful dish.

11:00.066 --> 11:01.733
The pork
was [bleep] gorgeous.

11:01.801 --> 11:04.136
That was delicious.
Just phenomenal.

11:04.204 --> 11:05.337
I mean, I would have
made love to it right there.

11:05.405 --> 11:07.806
Absolutely delicious.

11:07.874 --> 11:09.007
Thank you, Chef.

11:09.075 --> 11:12.244
Well done.
One-nil for the blue team.

11:12.312 --> 11:15.247
Right!
Holli, Jason, let's go.

11:15.315 --> 11:16.748
<i>(Announcer)
Next up, Holli and Siobhan</i>

11:16.816 --> 11:18.383
<i>try to even the score</i>

11:18.451 --> 11:21.253
<i>as their dish squares off
against Jason and Autumn's.</i>

11:21.321 --> 11:22.855
Jason, let's start with you.
What is that?

11:22.922 --> 11:25.557
It's a honey-glazed bacon,
Chef, with honey slaw.

11:25.625 --> 11:27.025
Bacon?
How is it cooked?

11:27.093 --> 11:29.094
We crisped it up
in the pan lightly

11:29.162 --> 11:30.796
and glazed it with
some honey, Chef.

11:30.864 --> 11:31.897
Tastes nice.

11:31.965 --> 11:33.031
Thank you, Chef.

11:33.099 --> 11:34.399
However...

11:34.467 --> 11:36.168
With the honey in the slaw,

11:36.236 --> 11:37.469
it's too sweet.

11:37.537 --> 11:38.737
No mustard in there

11:38.805 --> 11:40.072
to sort of counteract

11:40.139 --> 11:42.341
the sort of the level
of sweetness going on.

11:42.408 --> 11:45.344
I said to Jason,
"I should use mustard."

11:45.411 --> 11:47.713
I'm gonna make like
a honey mustard, then.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.149
I should have done it.

11:51.217 --> 11:52.718
It was the one thing
missing from my dish.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.054
What is that?

11:56.122 --> 11:58.156
Okay, we have a fennel-crusted
pork tenderloin

11:58.224 --> 11:59.358
with a sweet-and-sour apple.

11:59.425 --> 12:00.726
And then a mustard sauce.

12:04.130 --> 12:05.931
Mmm.

12:05.999 --> 12:08.100
The pork tenderloin
is cooked perfectly.

12:09.802 --> 12:12.871
And on that basis, yeah,
well done, red team.

12:12.939 --> 12:14.172
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you, Chef.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.808
Okay, Maria and Jay,
let's go.

12:16.876 --> 12:18.043
<i>(Announcer)
With the score tied at one,</i>

12:18.111 --> 12:20.345
<i>it's Maria and Scott's dish</i>

12:20.413 --> 12:22.281
<i>versus Jay and Salvatore's.</i>

12:23.683 --> 12:25.250
Right.
Jay, what is that?

12:25.318 --> 12:27.352
It's a Latin-rubbed
pork loin chop

12:27.420 --> 12:28.854
served over
some pinto beans.

12:30.223 --> 12:31.590
Who cooked the pork?

12:31.658 --> 12:33.225
- I did, Chef.
- Tastes nice.

12:33.293 --> 12:34.226
Thank you, Chef.

12:34.294 --> 12:35.694
Maria, what is that?

12:35.762 --> 12:37.262
You know,
when we had sweet potato,

12:37.330 --> 12:39.164
I was, like, sweet potato soup,
ham hock,

12:39.232 --> 12:40.966
and then we do it like a...
honey-infused the oil.

12:41.034 --> 12:43.135
We put another pan over it

12:43.202 --> 12:44.436
and let it, like,
pressure cook,

12:44.504 --> 12:45.737
like, one sprig,
again, with the thyme,

12:45.805 --> 12:47.172
just like let it
kind of marinate.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.607
Not like a lot at all.

12:48.675 --> 12:49.675
Breathe.

12:49.742 --> 12:50.776
(Maria)
I don't know,

12:50.843 --> 12:52.277
maybe I talk
a little too much.

12:52.345 --> 12:55.213
I don't know if it's just
flat-out a lack of self-control.

12:55.281 --> 12:56.415
That was the first thing
I thought.

12:56.482 --> 12:57.582
I was like,
ham hock, gotta braise it.

12:57.650 --> 12:58.884
Gotta do
some sort of soup, and...

12:58.952 --> 13:00.686
It's outrag...
look at me right now.

13:00.753 --> 13:02.354
I can't even stop myself.

13:04.090 --> 13:06.291
Nice soup.

13:06.359 --> 13:08.627
The winning dish...

13:10.330 --> 13:11.596
Congratulations!

13:18.126 --> 13:20.561
<i>(Announcer) The score is tied

13:20.629 --> 13:22.797
<i>and it all comes down
to Jay's pork chop</i>

<i>and Maria's sweet potato soup.</i>

13:25.300 --> 13:27.134
Maria, congratulations!

13:29.004 --> 13:31.639
'Cause you just
screwed your team.

13:31.707 --> 13:32.940
Listen to me.

13:33.008 --> 13:35.976
I asked for the ham hock

13:36.044 --> 13:38.112
as the main ingredient.

13:38.180 --> 13:40.848
And you're serving me
a sweet potato soup

13:40.916 --> 13:43.951
garnished with spoon
of ham hock.

13:44.019 --> 13:46.020
Blue team, congratulations.

13:46.088 --> 13:47.588
Back in line.

13:47.656 --> 13:48.989
Wonderful.

13:49.057 --> 13:50.858
Idiot.
I'm an idiot.

13:53.462 --> 13:55.196
Okay, punishment.

13:55.263 --> 13:57.164
On the back of losing
that challenge,

13:57.232 --> 14:01.402
you're gonna be getting
down and dirty.

14:01.470 --> 14:03.904
Andy, bring in
the overalls, please.

14:03.972 --> 14:04.972
You're definitely
gonna need those.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.108
Why?

14:07.175 --> 14:08.376
'Cause those pigs outside,

14:08.443 --> 14:12.146
they need a good,
nose-to-tail clean.

14:12.214 --> 14:13.681
- Is that clear?
(All) Yes, Chef!

14:13.749 --> 14:15.449
Okay, blue team,

very special

Uh, Scott, please
bring in their robes.

14:23.291 --> 14:24.859
Thank you, Chef.

cleaning all the mud

14:34.703 --> 14:36.804
Enjoy it.
Get upstairs.

14:36.872 --> 14:37.872
I'll call you back
in five minutes.

14:37.939 --> 14:40.174
Thank you, Chef.

14:40.242 --> 14:41.342
(Nilka) I told you I wasn't
happy with that [bleep].

14:41.410 --> 14:42.910
I was so mad.

14:42.978 --> 14:44.545
I'm embarrassed that I actually
put something like that out.

14:44.613 --> 14:46.113
So was I.

14:46.181 --> 14:47.415
(Fran) The red team
I thought was on a comeback.

14:47.482 --> 14:49.817
And... it kind of sucks

14:49.885 --> 14:51.519
to lose again,
I gotta tell you.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.821
This [bleep] is so stupid.

14:53.889 --> 14:55.856
You know, we keep taking it
as a positive

14:55.924 --> 14:57.658
when we lose,
but today hurt.

14:57.726 --> 14:59.126
I think today hurt the most
out of all of them.

14:59.194 --> 15:00.127
[oinking]

15:00.195 --> 15:01.595
Oh, man.

15:01.663 --> 15:03.397
All right, guys,
grab the pigs.

15:03.465 --> 15:04.565
Bring them in.
Wash them.

15:04.633 --> 15:06.400
Who wants
to get washed first?

15:06.468 --> 15:07.501
Hey, little guy.

My muscles have been
killing me.

15:34.162 --> 15:35.429
My back was aching.

15:35.497 --> 15:38.833
And the spa day...
that is right up my alley.

15:41.002 --> 15:42.236
(Jay) I've never been
to a spa before.

15:42.304 --> 15:44.038
"The Grotto."

15:44.105 --> 15:45.239
The Grotto may have
been the gayest thing

15:45.307 --> 15:46.207
I've ever done
in my entire life.

15:46.274 --> 15:49.410
Right over here
with Megan.

15:49.478 --> 15:51.979
(Jay)
We had four girls paint us

15:52.047 --> 15:55.483
with some kind
of seaweed wrap stuff.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.750
Okay, Sal!
[laughter]

15:56.818 --> 15:58.619
And then we sat down
and talked for a while.

15:59.855 --> 16:00.855
Hey, I kind of like it.

16:00.922 --> 16:02.223
Ah, you like it, huh?

16:02.290 --> 16:04.658
(Jay)
And then we showered...

16:04.726 --> 16:05.559
together.

16:10.131 --> 16:12.132
This was a good challenge
to win.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.035
Yeah, this beats pigs
any day.

16:15.103 --> 16:17.404
The squealing,
it's so high-pitched.

16:17.472 --> 16:18.973
Sounds like a pig
horror movie.

16:22.611 --> 16:23.777
[squealing]
Calm him down!

16:23.845 --> 16:25.346
[squealing]

16:25.413 --> 16:28.749
- Mine's mean!
- Whoo! Angry one.

16:28.817 --> 16:30.651
Wow! I haven't heard
a noise like that.

16:30.719 --> 16:32.620
Oh, my God!

16:32.687 --> 16:34.355
- What do I do?
- Relax.

16:34.422 --> 16:35.556
[squealing]

16:35.624 --> 16:38.225
You're okay.

16:38.293 --> 16:39.527
What about its butt?

16:39.594 --> 16:40.728
Whew!

16:43.632 --> 16:44.832
Check it out.

16:47.802 --> 16:49.737
I definitely feel welcome
on the blue team.

16:49.804 --> 16:52.907
I'll be one of the boys
faster than they'll know it.

16:52.974 --> 16:53.974
Oh!

16:58.713 --> 17:00.381
(Ed)
I could sit here all day.

17:00.448 --> 17:03.083
Autumn's gonna be a nice
addition to the blue team.

17:03.151 --> 17:04.351
I think she'll gel
just fine.

17:08.223 --> 17:09.323
If my wife sees this...

17:09.391 --> 17:10.691
[laughing]

17:10.759 --> 17:12.159
she's gonna be
a little jealous.

17:15.896 --> 17:17.897
I... would rather
have her than Scott.

17:22.270 --> 17:23.737
[laughter]

17:25.040 --> 17:26.205
Autumn, so far,

17:26.273 --> 17:27.708
we're one with you
on our team.

17:29.311 --> 17:31.679

17:40.188 --> 17:42.690
Salvatore is definitely
the Italian Dr. Phil.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.024
People like to talk to him.

17:44.092 --> 17:47.027
Tell a secret
that you have in your closet.

17:47.095 --> 17:48.395
He seems to get things
out of people

17:48.463 --> 17:49.997
that you would never think
in a million years.

17:52.734 --> 17:54.468
Go, baby.

17:54.536 --> 17:55.502
I have, probably,
the biggest porn collection

17:55.570 --> 17:57.404
out of anybody I know.

17:57.472 --> 17:58.505
I don't know...

17:58.573 --> 18:00.674
[laughter]

18:00.742 --> 18:02.109
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.

18:04.579 --> 18:05.946
No.

18:07.215 --> 18:08.949
No, I made...
I've made porn

18:09.017 --> 18:11.552
with... peop...
significant others.

18:11.620 --> 18:12.886
You see, it's coming out.

18:12.954 --> 18:14.622
I'm taking you
in the right...

18:14.689 --> 18:17.391
it's never been aired
anywhere, that I know of.

18:17.459 --> 18:19.860
I... I... I'm
at a loss for words,

18:19.928 --> 18:21.261
and that usually
doesn't happen.

18:21.329 --> 18:22.730
All right,
I'll tell you my story.

18:22.797 --> 18:23.931
(Salvatore)
Go, baby.

18:23.999 --> 18:26.233
I used to work
somewhat topless

18:26.301 --> 18:27.434
and somewhat nude.

18:27.502 --> 18:29.336
My name was Shannon
or Shannon Marie,

18:29.404 --> 18:31.505
or S&M was my nickname.

18:31.573 --> 18:32.873
And I used to do
fetish balls and...

18:32.941 --> 18:36.276
Like you tied up people?
[imitates whip cracking]

18:36.344 --> 18:38.012
There's be dominatrix stuff.
There'd be S&M stuff.

18:38.079 --> 18:39.947
I like S&M.

18:40.015 --> 18:41.281

Get downstairs.

18:43.218 --> 18:45.886
(Fran) We learned a lot
of interesting things tonight.

18:45.954 --> 18:47.955
You just say, you know,
these are chefs.

18:48.023 --> 18:50.524
Chefs are not
the typical personality.

18:50.592 --> 18:51.659
And I would be
completely nude

18:51.726 --> 18:53.293
and have body paint
on me and stuff.

18:53.361 --> 18:54.862
Get the pastry brush.
Get the barbecue sauce.

that Hell's Kitchen

is going...

19:18.119 --> 19:18.986
barbecue.

19:21.723 --> 19:22.823
I love to cook barbecue,

19:22.891 --> 19:24.058
and I think that it's awesome

19:24.125 --> 19:25.859
that we're serving
barbecue food

19:25.927 --> 19:26.994
in a fine dining atmosphere.

Let's go, in the kitchens.
Up!

the lime butter?

Never thought I'd be cooking
collard greens here, boy.

19:43.244 --> 19:44.144
Just like home,
honey?

19:44.212 --> 19:46.013
Baked beans,

19:46.081 --> 19:47.047
pulled pork.

19:47.115 --> 19:48.515
Gonna be the most intense

19:48.583 --> 19:49.650

I know, right?

19:49.718 --> 19:50.984
If I learn
how to do this right,

23:57.040 --> 23:58.741
But I didn't hear you!

23:58.809 --> 24:00.009
It's not
you can't ask me.

24:00.077 --> 24:01.310
You can ask me,
but you yelling at me,

24:01.378 --> 24:02.378
and I'm trying
to help him.

24:02.446 --> 24:03.612
Well, it's just
a yes or no.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.214
I didn't hear you!

24:05.282 --> 24:07.316
I know.
Sensitive, man.

24:07.384 --> 24:08.718
Who the [bleep]
are you yelling at?

24:08.785 --> 24:10.619
Like, I didn't
[bleep] hear you.

24:10.687 --> 24:12.121
Like I'm gonna
ignore your ass on purpose.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.322
Hey, guys, let's not
[bleep] argue, all right?

24:13.390 --> 24:14.490
Let's just cook.

24:14.558 --> 24:15.691
The red team,
it was a disaster.

24:15.759 --> 24:16.892
They would just, like,
stop in the middle

24:16.960 --> 24:17.960
of dinner service
and fight.

24:18.028 --> 24:19.361
We're not arguing,
I just...

24:19.429 --> 24:20.896
Okay, then let's not
scream at each other,

24:20.964 --> 24:22.098
let's cook.

24:22.165 --> 24:23.632
- Any crab come up?
- No!

24:23.700 --> 24:25.434
If I bring crab up,
I'll tell you.

24:25.502 --> 24:26.936
[overlapping arguing]
Two swordfish, one...

24:27.003 --> 24:28.170
Look at it, if you want
to take anything out of it.

24:28.238 --> 24:29.305
What's that?

24:29.372 --> 24:30.606
[bleep] hell's bells.

24:30.674 --> 24:32.007
Guys, listen to Chef.

24:32.075 --> 24:32.975
Stop it!

24:33.043 --> 24:34.610
Stop!

24:34.678 --> 24:35.878
I'm calling out an order,

24:35.946 --> 24:37.113
and not one of you
is even answering me!

24:37.180 --> 24:38.848
Listen to me,
you [bleep] idiots!

24:40.717 --> 24:41.917
Work as a team!

24:41.985 --> 24:43.552
(All)
Yes, Chef!

- Yes.

24:50.794 --> 24:51.827
Well done on appetizers.

24:51.895 --> 24:53.162
Yes, Chef.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.331
Fran did a really good job
tonight.

24:55.398 --> 24:58.367
She never gave up
and she never stopped trying.

24:58.435 --> 25:00.836
The appetizers are flying out!
Keep it going!

If you need me

You... you have
a look on your face.

25:26.029 --> 25:27.429
- Undercooked?
- A little under.

25:27.497 --> 25:29.565
Okay, I'm gonna take those
right back to the kitchen.

25:29.633 --> 25:31.567
I got myself all pretty.

25:31.635 --> 25:33.869
Gonna charm the tables.

25:33.937 --> 25:35.070
I'm gonna
send anything back

25:35.138 --> 25:36.372
just for the sake
of sending it back

25:36.439 --> 25:38.541

that collapses the red team.

25:38.608 --> 25:41.577
Oh, guys, come on.
What's the matter?

25:41.645 --> 25:42.745
It was supposed
to be medium, and...

25:42.813 --> 25:44.280
Medium and medium well, yes?

25:44.347 --> 25:45.548
These are wrong.

25:45.615 --> 25:47.016
Siobhan, Siobhan, Siobhan.

25:47.083 --> 25:49.652
Burger requested
medium well.

25:49.719 --> 25:52.755
Stone cold in the middle
and it's [bleep] rare.

25:52.823 --> 25:53.856
Ah, [bleep].

25:53.924 --> 25:55.858
Okay, refire two burgers!

25:55.926 --> 25:58.294
Tables are starting
to complain!

25:59.696 --> 26:01.430
You sure?
If you're unhappy with it,

26:01.498 --> 26:03.399
I can always
go and get you some more.

26:05.368 --> 26:06.335

Coming now, Chef.

How long is he
cooking this for?

26:22.385 --> 26:23.953
Scott!

26:24.020 --> 26:26.021
This chicken is like
something from outer space.

26:26.089 --> 26:27.489
Just feel it a little bit.

26:27.557 --> 26:30.125
It's cooked to [bleep]!

26:30.193 --> 26:31.460
It's like something from
a leftover

26:31.528 --> 26:32.661
fast food joint, Scott.

26:32.729 --> 26:34.096
Pathetic.

26:34.164 --> 26:36.232
Scott's got
the most experience,

26:36.299 --> 26:38.634
but he still screwed up
the whole chicken section.

26:38.702 --> 26:40.769
I mean, just
a complete disaster.

chicken!

oven door!

One [bleep] arm
in the fryer,

26:55.418 --> 26:57.019
one in the [bleep] stove!
Now stop it!

26:57.087 --> 26:58.120
Yes, Chef.

26:58.188 --> 27:00.522
He was working
so dangerous, Scott.

27:00.590 --> 27:02.658
He should have known better.

27:02.726 --> 27:04.126
We never cook

Thank God nobody got hurt.

We're now

An order
for table 44, yes?

29:35.231 --> 29:36.965

one salad, one bake.

Look.

30:03.759 --> 30:06.628
Salvatore,
one more corn!

30:06.695 --> 30:09.230
I don't understand why,
soon as he gets in the kitchen,

30:09.298 --> 30:10.465
he just, like, shuts down.

get one corn going.

- Here.

a table 33.

Chef!

30:53.309 --> 30:54.309
That table 33...

30:54.376 --> 30:55.410
we double-took the order,

30:55.477 --> 30:56.844
and that's
a double order, Chef.

30:56.912 --> 30:58.646
So how can you take
the same order twice?

30:58.714 --> 30:59.814
I took it
and Holli took it.

30:59.882 --> 31:01.649
Are you trying
to screw the blue team?

31:01.717 --> 31:02.884
No way.

31:02.951 --> 31:04.285
Holli!

31:04.353 --> 31:06.354
Holli,
get your ass in here!

31:06.422 --> 31:07.288
Uh, excuse me
one second, please.

31:07.356 --> 31:08.623
Unbelievable.

31:08.691 --> 31:11.059
Come here, you.
This is out of order.

31:11.126 --> 31:12.193
I took 33's order,

31:12.261 --> 31:13.394
and you took 33's order.

31:13.462 --> 31:15.263
- So we double...
- 33 is in my section.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.532
If 33 is in her section,
it's my fault.

31:17.599 --> 31:19.801
And Maria's, like,
losing it right now.

31:19.868 --> 31:21.069
Yeah, I took their orders...

31:21.136 --> 31:23.371
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

31:23.439 --> 31:24.739
Just out of interest,

31:24.807 --> 31:26.708
when you hit the table
the second time,

31:26.775 --> 31:28.910
why didn't you at least check
if their order's been taken?

31:28.977 --> 31:29.911
I don't know.

31:29.978 --> 31:32.046
You don't know.

31:32.114 --> 31:34.215
I think she's
overstressed or something,

31:34.283 --> 31:35.350
'cause she's just not there.

31:35.417 --> 31:36.951
Now [bleep] off
and leave me alone.

31:37.019 --> 31:39.320
<i>(Announcer)
Disgusted with the red team,</i>

31:39.388 --> 31:40.855
<i>Chef Ramsay
turns his attention</i>

31:40.923 --> 31:43.424
<i>to Autumn's
next order of ribs.</i>

31:43.492 --> 31:45.259
Oh, [bleep].

31:45.327 --> 31:46.828
All of you, come here!

31:46.895 --> 31:49.263
Come [bleep] here.

31:49.331 --> 31:51.199
Just touch inside that.

31:51.266 --> 31:53.434
- Oh.
- Oh [bleep] off.

31:53.502 --> 31:55.803
They're stone [bleep] cold!

31:55.871 --> 31:57.638
Ice cold in the center!

31:57.706 --> 32:00.108
- Yes, Chef!
- Look at the way her legs...

32:00.175 --> 32:01.442
just walking around
like you're just shopping.

32:01.510 --> 32:02.377
I'm not walking
around, Chef.

32:02.444 --> 32:03.678
I'm... I'm rushing.

32:03.746 --> 32:05.079
- You're rushing?
- Yes, Chef.

32:05.147 --> 32:06.481
Well, I'd hate
to see you slow.

32:08.050 --> 32:09.484
<i>(Announcer)
It's an hour and a half</i>

32:09.551 --> 32:11.686

dinner service,</i>

32:11.754 --> 32:14.255

This is not

32:16.658 --> 32:18.960
<i>(Announcer) Just not the ones
they asked for.</i>

32:19.027 --> 32:21.262
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

32:22.831 --> 32:24.499
So bring the dates back,

32:24.566 --> 32:26.334
- and you tell Chef why.
- Certainly.

32:26.402 --> 32:27.535
What's the matter?

32:27.603 --> 32:29.170
He doesn't
want the dates.

32:29.238 --> 32:30.238
Why?

32:30.305 --> 32:32.440
Because I sold him...

32:32.508 --> 32:34.575
I wrote down dates
and he wanted shrimp.

32:34.643 --> 32:35.610
So you're lying to me!
You [bleep] up the order!

32:35.677 --> 32:36.644
Not intentionally.

32:36.712 --> 32:38.246
Not inten...
Come in here, you.

32:38.313 --> 32:40.148
Come in, come in.
Come in!

32:40.215 --> 32:41.983
Surprise.

32:42.050 --> 32:44.352
I screwed up.
Again.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.387
I wrote down shrimp,
and they wanted dates.

32:46.455 --> 32:48.389
Or I wrote down dates,
and they wanted shrimp.

32:48.457 --> 32:50.258
Basically, she [bleep] up
the order, yeah?

32:50.325 --> 32:52.460
She [bleep] up the order.

32:52.528 --> 32:55.530
I can do a refire
in ten seconds, Chef.

32:55.597 --> 32:58.099
<i>(Announcer) With the clock
running out on their two hours...</i>

32:58.167 --> 32:59.500
Come on, guys,

32:59.568 --> 33:01.269
you got twenty-five minutes
to clear this board, yes?

33:01.336 --> 33:02.537
(All)
Yes, Chef!

33:02.604 --> 33:05.039
<i>(Announcer)
the blue team is moving quickly.</i>

33:05.107 --> 33:07.241
<i>But not carefully.</i>

33:07.309 --> 33:08.309
All of you, come here!

33:10.012 --> 33:11.078
So who's
the [bleep] smart-ass?

33:12.448 --> 33:14.949
Who's the [bleep] smart-ass?

33:15.017 --> 33:15.817
(Jason) I put the chicken
in there, Chef.

33:15.884 --> 33:17.218
What, with the fries?

33:17.286 --> 33:19.053
I just dropped the chicken
in the fries, Chef.

33:21.123 --> 33:22.356
(Jay) Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

33:22.424 --> 33:23.458
Get the chicken, come on!

33:23.525 --> 33:25.126
- Jason!
- Yes, Chef?

33:25.194 --> 33:26.561
- Jason, look at me!
- I'm looking, Chef!

33:26.628 --> 33:27.728
[bleep] not good enough!

33:27.796 --> 33:28.996
(Jason)
Yes, Chef!

33:29.064 --> 33:30.431
It's a [bleep]
fine dining restaurant, yeah?

33:30.499 --> 33:33.367
Not a [bleep] fast food
pickup joint!

33:33.435 --> 33:35.436
Get the fries
out of there first,

33:35.504 --> 33:37.171
then put your [bleep]
chicken in there!

33:37.239 --> 33:39.774
Yes, Chef!
The fries wasn't done, Chef.

33:39.842 --> 33:41.876
The fries are a [bleep] side!

33:41.944 --> 33:43.344
Get your chicken,
go and get your [bleep]...

33:43.412 --> 33:45.379
listen to me, Jason!
I'm listening, Chef!

33:45.447 --> 33:46.814
Then do it, then!

33:49.418 --> 33:50.685
Do it!

33:54.867 --> 33:56.034

<i>(Announcer) Chef Ramsay has
a simple request for Jason.</i>

34:06.279 --> 34:08.280
Get the fries
out of there first,

34:08.348 --> 34:10.047
then put your [bleep] chicken
in there!

34:10.116 --> 34:12.417
Yes, Chef.
The fries wasn't done, Chef.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.286
The fries are
a [bleep] side!

34:14.353 --> 34:15.887
Get your chicken going,
get the [bleep]...

34:15.955 --> 34:17.822
- Listen to me, Jason!
- I'm listening, Chef!

34:17.889 --> 34:19.257
Then do it then!

34:20.927 --> 34:22.327
- Do it!
- I'm doing it, Chef!

34:27.233 --> 34:29.735
(Jason) I see him, put up
with his [bleep] ass [bleep].

34:29.802 --> 34:30.936
He's [bleep] crazy.

34:31.004 --> 34:33.739
I don't give a
[bleep] [bleep].

34:33.806 --> 34:35.806
I don't know what's going
through Jason's head.

34:35.875 --> 34:37.641
I just want to turn around
and say, "Shut the [bleep] up."

34:37.710 --> 34:38.976
Just listen
to what Chef has to say.

34:39.045 --> 34:40.712
Don't talk back
to Chef like that.

34:40.780 --> 34:42.414
Come on, guys,
there's ten minutes left.

34:42.482 --> 34:44.081
- Come on, let's go.
- Yes, Chef.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.083
I need the [bleep] entrees!

34:46.152 --> 34:47.753
Come on,
let's push this out.

34:47.820 --> 34:48.887
Service, please.

34:50.056 --> 34:51.690
Coming down hot.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.324
[overlapping chatter]

34:55.328 --> 34:57.094
Five minutes.

34:57.163 --> 34:58.463
- Hurry up, Autumn!
- Yes, Chef!

34:58.531 --> 34:59.831
Work it! Come on!

34:59.899 --> 35:01.333
Go.

35:01.401 --> 35:02.968
Chicken.

35:03.036 --> 35:04.169
(Gordon)
One minute left!

35:04.237 --> 35:06.805
Are you ready?
I'm ready to go off with that.

35:06.873 --> 35:08.640
- Hurry up, Jason!
- Give me three minutes.

35:08.708 --> 35:09.908
Three minutes.

35:12.345 --> 35:14.479
It's not possible
to be that [bleep] long.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.114
[bleep] crazy.

35:16.182 --> 35:18.150
Time!

35:18.217 --> 35:19.317
I told you to speed it up.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.186
Everything off!

35:21.254 --> 35:23.488
If our team loses tonight,

35:23.556 --> 35:25.624
it'll be bye, bye, see you...
I'm going home.

35:25.691 --> 35:26.591
I love you, honey.

35:26.659 --> 35:27.659
Meet me at the airport.

35:27.727 --> 35:28.991
[bleep].

35:35.168 --> 35:38.136
Out of all the services
so far in Hell's Kitchen,

35:38.204 --> 35:39.971
that was our worst.

35:43.776 --> 35:46.678
We're talking
basic barbecue, yes?

35:46.746 --> 35:49.114
Was that really
the best we could do?

35:49.182 --> 35:50.449
Personally, I thought

35:50.516 --> 35:51.850
it was supposed
to have been easier.

35:51.918 --> 35:55.320
So losing team tonight...

35:55.388 --> 35:56.822
overall...

35:56.889 --> 35:59.891
combined, as a team effort...

36:01.394 --> 36:02.394
the red team.

36:06.232 --> 36:08.400
It's almost like
you all hate each other.

36:08.468 --> 36:11.436
There was one Chef,
however,

36:11.504 --> 36:13.772
that did impress me.

36:15.308 --> 36:17.576
Fran, you were on top
of your game

36:17.643 --> 36:19.244
with the appetizers.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.981
Now get upstairs
and think

36:23.049 --> 36:24.916
of two individuals
in your team

36:24.984 --> 36:26.518
up for elimination.

36:31.324 --> 36:32.624
(Fran)
I had a really good night.

36:32.692 --> 36:34.926
Chef acknowledged it,
so that felt good.

36:34.994 --> 36:37.429
But we are tired of losing.

36:37.497 --> 36:39.831
I can't believe we're
[bleep] doing this again.

36:39.899 --> 36:40.899
[bleep] horrible.

36:40.967 --> 36:43.101
I can't [bleep]
believe it.

36:43.169 --> 36:44.736
Yeah, it's not fun.
At all.

36:44.804 --> 36:46.671
Sorry that I
[bleep] up the service.

36:46.739 --> 36:48.840
I did one of the worst
services

36:48.908 --> 36:49.975
that I've ever had.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.243
That should have
been, like,

36:51.310 --> 36:53.044
the easiest station
of the night, for sure.

36:53.112 --> 36:55.514
We both [bleep] up.
Plain and simple!

36:55.581 --> 36:56.748
Well, like,
the difference is

36:56.816 --> 36:58.617
I put in a hard-ass effort
from the start.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.352
You didn't.

37:01.821 --> 37:02.888
Look, I'd love
to keep everybody.

37:02.955 --> 37:04.756
I've got to put two.

37:04.824 --> 37:06.625
It doesn't matter.
I've got to put two.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.055
And you got to fight for
your [bleep] life like I have.

37:11.364 --> 37:13.131
(Fran)
I don't know about Scott yet.

37:13.199 --> 37:16.168
It seems as if maybe
Scott's not as good

37:16.235 --> 37:17.169
as he perceives to be.

37:19.605 --> 37:20.639
I've been stepping up
to the plate,

37:20.706 --> 37:21.806
and I [bleep] up tonight.

37:21.874 --> 37:23.742
My stuff was not
cooked properly.

37:23.809 --> 37:26.211
I had those couple burgers
get sent back that were raw.

37:26.279 --> 37:29.281
But I take full blame
for my screwed-up food, period.

37:29.348 --> 37:31.449
I'm just really
hard on myself.

37:31.517 --> 37:32.450
You got to get
a little stronger.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.287
If I go up for elimination
again tonight,

37:35.354 --> 37:36.621
I'll probably be [bleep]
sent home as well.

37:36.689 --> 37:37.622
And I don't want
to [bleep] go home.

37:37.690 --> 37:38.790
I'm not ready for it.

37:38.858 --> 37:40.392
I'm ready to [bleep] fight.
That's it.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.861
(Scott) By no means
am I gonna go pack my bags.

37:42.929 --> 37:45.030
I just want to look
after myself now.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.199
And I'll put up a fight
till the end.

37:49.902 --> 37:50.769
Can I just
explain one thing?

37:50.836 --> 37:51.803
Yeah.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.881
Okay.

38:02.949 --> 38:04.115
(Fran)
Scott has a point.

38:04.183 --> 38:06.518
But I really would need
to think about it,

38:06.586 --> 38:07.452
because who else is left?

38:21.067 --> 38:22.067
Right.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.568
Fran.

38:23.636 --> 38:24.936
First nominee, and why.

38:25.004 --> 38:26.938
Maria, Chef.

38:27.006 --> 38:28.373
Why?

38:28.441 --> 38:30.342
Maria has totally
fallen apart.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.576
She's an emotional
rollercoaster

38:31.644 --> 38:33.078
and she has kept our team

38:33.145 --> 38:35.113
down long enough.

38:35.181 --> 38:36.147
Right.
Second nominee and why.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.053
My second nominee is Nilka.

38:44.257 --> 38:45.790
It would have been nice for you
to let me know that, though.

38:45.858 --> 38:47.425
Don't just bring me up here
and surprise me.

38:57.508 --> 39:00.010
<i>(Announcer) After putting Maria
up for elimination,</i>

39:00.077 --> 39:02.012
<i>Fran nominated...</i>

39:02.079 --> 39:04.047
Nilka.

39:04.115 --> 39:05.548
It would have been nice for you
to let me know that, though.

39:05.616 --> 39:07.417
Don't just bring me up here
and surprise me.

39:07.485 --> 39:08.685
No Scott?

39:08.753 --> 39:10.754
No, I felt Scott

39:10.821 --> 39:13.823
is a very strong
team player in the kitchen.

39:13.891 --> 39:15.125
See, this type of attitude

39:15.192 --> 39:16.993
is where we have
a bit of a problem.

39:17.061 --> 39:20.196
(Gordon)
Maria, Nilka...

39:20.264 --> 39:22.132
Scott.

39:23.501 --> 39:25.268
Get your [bleep] asses
up here.

39:30.241 --> 39:31.174
Nilka...

39:31.242 --> 39:32.175
Yes, Chef?

39:32.243 --> 39:34.544
You had a bad service.

39:34.612 --> 39:36.313
But not as bad as these two.
Back in line.

39:36.380 --> 39:37.447
Absolutely, Chef.

39:37.515 --> 39:38.915
And stand close to Fran.

39:41.552 --> 39:43.920
Okay, Maria...

39:43.988 --> 39:45.455
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:45.523 --> 39:48.191
I had an awful,
awful service today.

39:48.259 --> 39:49.326
Like, worst ever.

39:49.393 --> 39:50.660
And, honestly,

39:50.728 --> 39:52.696
I really feel
that I can do better.

39:52.763 --> 39:54.864
I feel that you know
I can do better.

39:54.932 --> 39:57.967
What I'm really struggling
to believe with you

39:58.035 --> 40:01.037
is the level of...
commitment, Maria.

40:01.105 --> 40:04.941
Do you hold any pride,
dignity,

40:05.009 --> 40:07.277
and passion
in this industry?

40:07.345 --> 40:09.546
If I didn't, I wouldn't
be fighting with you

40:09.613 --> 40:11.948
right now in order to stay.

40:12.016 --> 40:12.982
Scott...

40:14.318 --> 40:16.119
Why are you back here?

40:16.187 --> 40:18.054
Blue team, red team.

40:18.122 --> 40:19.889
What's going on?

40:19.957 --> 40:21.925
I come in and bust ass
every [bleep] day.

40:21.992 --> 40:24.127
I work harder than anyone else
in the kitchen, prep-wise.

40:24.195 --> 40:26.229
I'm not looking
for a [bleep] prep chef

40:26.297 --> 40:27.397
to run the Savoy Grill.

40:27.465 --> 40:28.698
I understand that, Chef.

40:28.766 --> 40:29.833
I'm looking
for a phenomenal chef,

40:29.900 --> 40:31.134
great leadership qualities.

40:31.202 --> 40:32.369
I possess all those.

40:32.436 --> 40:33.636
[sighs]

40:33.704 --> 40:35.305
You can teach technique,

40:35.373 --> 40:36.539
you can't teach leadership.

40:37.975 --> 40:39.709
I have leadership abilities.

40:39.777 --> 40:40.910
If you need me to learn
different techniques

40:40.978 --> 40:41.945
to be correct,

40:42.012 --> 40:43.113
I will do so.

40:43.180 --> 40:45.148
But you have to cook.

40:46.884 --> 40:49.285
The person
leaving Hell's Kitchen...

40:55.526 --> 40:57.660
Maria.

40:57.728 --> 40:58.695
Give me your jacket

40:58.763 --> 41:00.196
and leave Hell's Kitchen.

41:05.503 --> 41:06.503
- Thank you.
- Here you go, Chef.

41:06.570 --> 41:07.771
Now [bleep].

41:10.875 --> 41:12.675
I really didn't
show the heart.

41:12.743 --> 41:15.111
I didn't show
all of my capabilities.

41:15.179 --> 41:17.247
But, based on
performance alone,

41:17.314 --> 41:20.550
Scott had a worse service
than me.

41:20.618 --> 41:22.519
Plain and simple.

41:22.586 --> 41:23.753
Back in line, you.

41:23.821 --> 41:25.755
Yes, Chef.

41:25.823 --> 41:27.223
Fran...

41:27.291 --> 41:28.658
I give you a responsibility.

41:28.726 --> 41:30.427
Follow your instincts.

41:32.296 --> 41:33.129
Good night.

41:35.166 --> 41:36.433
(Scott)
I'm tired of talking [bleep].

41:36.500 --> 41:38.067
I'm tried of trying to be
the big badass,

41:38.135 --> 41:40.103
because I'm kind of wearing
sheep's clothing right now.

41:40.171 --> 41:42.439
I can cook, and I will prove
that I can cook.

41:42.506 --> 41:44.841
(Nilka) I hope Fran feels like
a jackass right now.

41:44.909 --> 41:46.142
Because she should.

41:46.210 --> 41:47.343
I can't be her friend.

41:47.411 --> 41:48.611
I don't want
to work with her.

41:48.679 --> 41:50.313
And that's it.

41:50.381 --> 41:52.949
(Fran)
Our team is in shambles,

41:53.017 --> 41:54.551
as far as I'm concerned
right now.

41:55.920 --> 41:59.155
I am truly sorry
for what I have just done.

41:59.223 --> 42:01.758
Bad judgment.
Such a bad judgment.

42:01.826 --> 42:04.260
(Gordon)
Maria was in over her head.

42:04.328 --> 42:06.696
On garnish, she was lost,
and her team paid the cost.

42:06.764 --> 42:09.999
That's why her life
in Hell's Kitchen is dead.

<i>(announcer) Coming up next on
Hell's Kitchen... Nilka...</i>

42:17.141 --> 42:19.242
Y'all can kiss
my [bleep] ass.

42:19.310 --> 42:20.610
<i>(Announcer)
and Scott...</i>

42:20.678 --> 42:21.711
She took all the [bleep]
that I wanted to use.

42:21.779 --> 42:23.513
<i>(Announcer)
do more trash talking.</i>

42:23.581 --> 42:25.381
(Scott) It's difficult when
you're working with people

42:25.449 --> 42:26.616
that don't have
a lot of talent or skill.

42:26.684 --> 42:27.717
<i>(Announcer)
And cooking.</i>

42:27.785 --> 42:29.385
Scott is so cocky.

42:29.453 --> 42:30.954
<i>(Announcer)
At dinner service...</i>

42:31.021 --> 42:32.055
Just cook!

42:32.122 --> 42:34.023
<i>(Announcer)
it's the good...</i>

42:34.091 --> 42:34.991
(Gordon) That's cooked perfectly,
the Wellington.

42:35.059 --> 42:36.025
<i>(Announcer)
the bad...</i>

42:36.093 --> 42:37.927
It's stone cold
in the middle!

42:37.995 --> 42:39.496
<i>(Announcer)
and the clueless.</i>

42:39.563 --> 42:41.598
Pasta? No one told me
I was cooking pasta.

42:41.665 --> 42:43.166
It's a disaster!

42:43.234 --> 42:45.668
<i>(Announcer) One Chef makes
a career-ending mistake.</i>

42:45.736 --> 42:47.470
You just lost my trust!

42:47.538 --> 42:49.839
<i>(Announcer) And every chef
in Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:49.907 --> 42:51.207
This is shambolic!

42:51.275 --> 42:52.876
<i>(Announcer)
will pay the price.</i>

42:52.943 --> 42:54.410
[bleep] off, all of you!
Get out!

42:54.478 --> 42:55.545
<i>(Announcer)
Right now...</i>

42:55.613 --> 42:56.779
Get out!

42:56.847 --> 42:57.814
<i>(Announcer)
on Hell's Kitchen.</i>
