00:44.614 --> 00:46.234
Bring this around.

00:46.234 --> 00:48.594
Bring it here, OK?

00:48.594 --> 00:53.434
I want these hods on the back of
that thing, OK? What's he up to?

00:53.434 --> 00:54.954
You two, get in there.

00:54.954 --> 00:57.014
Right? Come on.

00:59.134 --> 01:00.414
Lamby!

01:01.774 --> 01:05.294
We're already behind schedule,
what do you think you're doing?

01:10.274 --> 01:12.754
They look like gargoyles, sir.

01:12.754 --> 01:16.634
The contortions of the bodies
would suggest poisoning.

01:16.634 --> 01:18.494
An astute hypothesis, detective.

01:18.494 --> 01:23.194
Cyanide, perhaps? That would
explain the clenched fists.

01:23.194 --> 01:24.994
What about the colour of their skin?

01:24.994 --> 01:28.054
Stained by the damp earth, I suspect.

01:28.054 --> 01:30.814
Cyanide is often used in suicides.

01:30.814 --> 01:33.014
Perhaps they killed themselves.

01:33.014 --> 01:36.414
How did they then bury
themselves, George?

01:36.414 --> 01:39.234
Point taken, sir. So a murder, then?

01:39.234 --> 01:43.194
Judging by the condition,
I suspect they were killed
within the last two weeks.

01:43.194 --> 01:44.374
Not likely.

01:45.974 --> 01:49.234
There was a shed
built over those piles.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.894
Could someone have cut the
floorboards, then, to bury them?

01:51.894 --> 01:55.214
No, Lamby and myself would
have noticed a thing like that.

01:55.214 --> 01:58.294
When was the shed demolished?
We took up the floor this morning.

01:59.794 --> 02:02.914
So the bodies were buried
before the shed was built?

02:02.914 --> 02:04.634
Any idea when that might have been?

02:04.634 --> 02:08.253
About five years ago,
as I recollect. Five years?

02:08.253 --> 02:13.014
So they were lying there
in the ground all of this time,
perfectly preserved?

02:16.794 --> 02:20.914
Five years in the ground and they've
not decomposed? How's that possible?

02:20.914 --> 02:23.934
They were buried in
sphagnum moss, sir.

02:23.934 --> 02:25.454
Moss? As in peat moss?

02:25.454 --> 02:28.514
Yes, its acidic nature acts
as a sort of preservative.

02:28.514 --> 02:32.254
The watery, airless conditions
prevent organic matter
from decomposing.

02:32.254 --> 02:34.134
I've never heard of such a thing.

02:34.134 --> 02:37.094
Well, sir, there has been
a recorded case just this year.

02:37.094 --> 02:42.074
A young girl was found in a peat bog
in the Netherlands, she was...
I'll take your word for it.

02:42.074 --> 02:45.294
So whoever built this shed
did it to conceal the bodies?

02:45.294 --> 02:48.174
That would be the owner of
the factory, a James Kirkham.

02:48.174 --> 02:51.454
I've asked George to find him
and determine the nature
of his business.

02:51.454 --> 02:53.414
I did ask him to be quick.

02:53.414 --> 02:58.374
Oh, good, because with a five
year-old case, we wouldn't want
the trail to go cold, would we?

03:02.154 --> 03:07.474
Remarkable. I'm receiving telegrams
from universities and museums,
all but begging for information.

03:07.474 --> 03:12.494
This is a very rare find.
Did you know that earlier this year,
the body of a mummified woman...

03:12.494 --> 03:17.534
Was discovered in the Netherlands,
preserved in a peat bog
just like this.

03:17.534 --> 03:19.074
Yes.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.834
So, what have you learnt, doctor?

03:20.834 --> 03:25.854
Well, they're a male and female,
obviously, both approximately
40 years of age.

03:25.854 --> 03:27.994
And how did you determine that?

03:27.994 --> 03:31.014
Fine wrinkles where the skin
has been folded on itself.

03:31.014 --> 03:35.194
People go grey at different rates,
but skin breakdown is fairly uniform.

03:35.194 --> 03:40.314
Of particular interest, their
internal organs are entirely intact,
as are their stomach contents.

03:42.414 --> 03:49.754
It looks like partially digested
meat, potato and onion.

03:49.754 --> 03:51.974
And cyanide, in both stomachs.

03:51.974 --> 03:54.194
They were definitely poisoned.

03:54.194 --> 03:56.874
Were they husband and wife,
or brother and sister?

03:56.874 --> 04:01.574
They are similar ages, and the fact
they shared the same last meal
would suggest they cohabited.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.334
Yes, and there's this.

04:04.334 --> 04:07.334
The dental apparatus I found
in the woman's mouth.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.034
Are these teeth human?

04:09.034 --> 04:11.894
I'd guess goat or calf.

04:11.894 --> 04:15.634
Clearly, the dentist they visited
employed primitive techniques.

04:15.634 --> 04:18.254
Or they could have been immigrants
from Eastern Europe, perhaps?

04:19.834 --> 04:22.194
Well, this is an excellent start.

04:22.194 --> 04:26.874
Yes, well, I may have saved
the best for last.

04:30.234 --> 04:33.554
It's like it's staring at me, sir.
Yes, quite realistic, isn't it?

04:33.554 --> 04:35.614
How would one keep it
from falling out?

04:35.614 --> 04:38.754
I mean, imagine how embarrassing,
at a lovely romantic dinner and...

04:38.754 --> 04:40.954
Your glass eye falls into your soup.

04:40.954 --> 04:43.494
Not this one, George.
This one is very well made.

04:43.494 --> 04:46.394
It would have been custom fitted
to the man's eye socket.

04:46.394 --> 04:49.214
There appears to be an
identification mark of some sort.

04:49.214 --> 04:51.634
Something to offer us
some insight, sir?

04:51.634 --> 04:55.794
George, there's a very attractive
young lady to see you here.

04:55.794 --> 04:59.734
Georgie! Penny! Oh, my!

04:59.734 --> 05:02.434
Hello. Yes, thank you,
that will be all, Higgins.

05:02.434 --> 05:06.354
Georgie, how wonderful to see you.
The trip was long and the
rail car had a odour,

05:06.354 --> 05:09.854
but it went by quickly,
and Toronto is bigger than
I thought it would be.

05:09.854 --> 05:12.614
You look so smart in your uniform!

05:12.614 --> 05:15.034
Is that a glass eye?

05:15.034 --> 05:17.534
I do believe it's staring at me.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.674
Relative of yours, George?

05:19.674 --> 05:23.054
Please allow me to introduce you
to my cousin, Miss Penny Renton.

05:23.054 --> 05:26.434
This is Detective Murdoch.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Miss Renton.

05:26.434 --> 05:30.394
Sir. If you don't mind,
Georgie's always writing home
about your brilliant ideas

05:30.394 --> 05:34.454
and how many experiments you do
and how he's so much wishing
he will be like you one day.

05:34.454 --> 05:37.394
Penny tends to go on
quite a bit, sir.

05:37.394 --> 05:40.314
She came all the way from Belleville
to attend secretarial school.

05:40.314 --> 05:43.674
Well, in that case, I wish you all
the success in the world.

05:43.674 --> 05:48.194
Now, if you don't mind, I have
a couple of things I need to discuss
with Constable Crabtree.

05:48.194 --> 05:51.994
Constable Crabtree! Of course.

05:51.994 --> 05:54.874
Sir, about the letters,
she tends to exaggerate.

05:54.874 --> 05:56.794
It's quite all right, George.

05:56.794 --> 05:59.154
Um, I looked into the factory
and its owner

05:59.154 --> 06:02.234
and I think you'll be particularly
interested in what they made there.

06:02.234 --> 06:05.814
Very good. And please find out
all you can about this glass eye -

06:05.814 --> 06:07.994
where it was manufactured,
when and for whom.

06:07.994 --> 06:10.694
Sir, I will look into it.

06:14.274 --> 06:15.954
I'm nipping this in the bud.

06:22.894 --> 06:25.874
As I already told your colleague,
there'll be no photographs

06:25.874 --> 06:29.334
of the bodies released,
nor any details of this case.

06:29.334 --> 06:32.974
Yes, you can call back
later if you wish.

06:32.974 --> 06:37.414
But don't expect to hear anything
differently. Thank you. Bye-bye.

06:37.414 --> 06:42.294
Bloody reporters. That's
the third one I've had sniffing
around for your mummies, Murdoch.

06:42.294 --> 06:46.174
Buried treasure, I understand,
but buried bodies? What's this?

06:46.174 --> 06:50.294
Information on James Kirkham,
the factory owner who built
the shed over the burial site.

06:50.294 --> 06:54.274
It was an electroplating factory.
Any significance in that?

06:54.274 --> 06:59.034
An electrolyte used in both gold
and silver electroplating
is a cyanide solution.

06:59.034 --> 07:01.234
Poison responsible for the deaths.

07:01.234 --> 07:04.494
You think the bodies may have
been factory workers?

07:04.494 --> 07:07.474
Apparently Kirkham was
very hard on his employees.

07:07.474 --> 07:11.494
Check missing persons reports
from the period.
Already looking into it, sir.

07:11.494 --> 07:14.354
He'd quite a violent streak,
this fella.

07:14.354 --> 07:18.454
Kirkham was arrested twice
for harassment and
three times for assault.

07:18.454 --> 07:21.814
He does them in, up goes the shed
and no-one's the wiser.

07:21.814 --> 07:24.974
Am I really here
to talk about a shed?

07:26.574 --> 07:29.114
Two people were found buried
underneath that shed.

07:29.114 --> 07:32.154
You think I had something
to do with it?

07:32.154 --> 07:34.374
They died of cyanide poisoning.

07:34.374 --> 07:36.954
You used cyanide in your factory.

07:36.954 --> 07:39.614
Yes, but I didn't feed it
to anybody.

07:39.614 --> 07:44.914
These people were murdered,
Mr Kirkham, and then buried
beneath a shed you built.

07:44.914 --> 07:48.274
Be that as it may,
I didn't murder them.

07:50.094 --> 07:54.014
You owed many people money,
did you not? Still do.

07:54.014 --> 07:56.894
Did any of them ever come
to your factory to collect?

07:56.894 --> 07:58.694
Afraid I can't answer that.

07:58.694 --> 08:00.614
I beg your pardon?

08:00.614 --> 08:04.414
I'm involved in several disputes
of a civil nature.

08:04.414 --> 08:08.574
My lawyer has forbidden me
to discuss any details regarding
my debt obligations.

08:08.574 --> 08:11.994
Are you deliberately evading
my inquiries, Mr Kirkham?

08:11.994 --> 08:17.054
I'm doing no such thing. I'm free
to talk at length about my shed.

08:17.054 --> 08:21.214
Two people have been murdered, and I
believe you know something about it.

08:21.214 --> 08:24.034
You will either tell me... Sir?

08:24.034 --> 08:25.254
Excuse me. A word?

08:32.354 --> 08:36.693
I'm in the middle of an interview,
George. That's why I felt
I had to interrupt you.

08:36.693 --> 08:42.674
What do you mean? Sir, the glass eye
found in our male body was made
by an oculist named Brian Winston.

08:42.674 --> 08:47.334
Winston stopped manufacturing glass
eyes in 1850, almost 50 years ago.

08:49.094 --> 08:53.894
What does that mean? 1850 is the
last year our male victim could
have been fitted with the eye.

08:53.894 --> 08:59.414
If he was 18 at the time, which he
would have had to have been to have
been fitted with a custom glass eye,

08:59.414 --> 09:04.814
and 40 when he died, 1872 is
the last year he could have died.

09:04.814 --> 09:07.074
Before the electroplating factory
was even built.

09:07.074 --> 09:09.954
Which would exonerate Mr Kirkham.

09:09.954 --> 09:13.554
And those bodies have remained
perfectly preserved all this time?
Yes, sir.

09:13.554 --> 09:17.374
25 years, is this even worth
pursuing, Murdoch?

09:17.374 --> 09:18.914
The culprit's probably dead by now.

09:18.914 --> 09:21.054
Age isn't amnesty, sir.

09:21.054 --> 09:25.814
Two people have been murdered.
We owe it to the victims to find
out the truth about their deaths.

09:25.814 --> 09:29.294
If the killer is out there,
I'll find him.

09:31.986 --> 09:36.966
This map, dated 1888, clearly shows
the Kirkham factory.

09:36.966 --> 09:43.246
The X is where the bodies
were found. That's right.
This one, dated 1872...

09:43.246 --> 09:46.546
The last year that we believe
our mystery mummies
could have been killed.

09:46.546 --> 09:50.286
Right. It was mostly farmland
back then, but there is a house

09:50.286 --> 09:52.886
approximately 20 yards from
where the bodies were found.

09:52.886 --> 09:55.206
When was the house torn down?
1880. Sir?

09:55.206 --> 09:57.166
Any luck at City Records, Crabtree?

09:57.166 --> 10:01.446
The land and the surrounding area
was purchased from City Hall in 1852.

10:01.446 --> 10:06.346
Whoever owned that house must know
something about those bodies.
Could well be our killer.

10:06.346 --> 10:10.606
George, were you able to find out
who purchased the house?
His name is Horace Mooney.

10:10.606 --> 10:12.126
On the old farm?

10:12.126 --> 10:16.326
Yes. Well, I wish I knew how
I could help you, detective,

10:16.326 --> 10:19.426
but I haven't lived there
since I sold the place in...

10:19.426 --> 10:21.426
1879. That's right.

10:21.426 --> 10:25.326
The bodies have been there since
at least 1872, Mr Mooney.

10:25.326 --> 10:28.406
You were living there during
that time, were you not? I was.

10:28.406 --> 10:31.506
Then perhaps you can explain how
two people came to be buried

10:31.506 --> 10:34.246
less than 20 yards from your door
without you noticing?

10:34.246 --> 10:37.766
That's a very good question,
detective, and I wish
I knew the answer.

10:37.766 --> 10:39.606
I believe you do.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.166
And whether you buried them
or murdered them as well...

10:42.166 --> 10:45.366
Murder? Detective, I didn't
kill them, I didn't bury them.

10:45.366 --> 10:49.346
I honestly wish there was something
I could do to help you out.

10:49.346 --> 10:51.186
Perhaps there is.

10:54.346 --> 10:57.686
Do you recognise them, Mr Mooney?

10:57.686 --> 11:00.546
How can they still be preserved
like this?

11:00.546 --> 11:02.746
They're mummified.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.746
Do you recognise them?

11:04.746 --> 11:06.746
No.

11:06.746 --> 11:09.126
Someone who went missing, perhaps?

11:09.126 --> 11:10.866
Neighbours, farm hands?

11:10.866 --> 11:12.526
No.

11:12.526 --> 11:17.946
So, complete strangers
were buried on your property
without your knowledge?

11:17.946 --> 11:19.546
I suppose so.

11:21.626 --> 11:24.646
If that's all?

11:24.646 --> 11:26.306
Yes, Mr Mooney, that's all.

11:26.306 --> 11:27.786
For now.

11:30.746 --> 11:33.706
What do you make of his reaction
to the bodies?

11:33.706 --> 11:38.106
It's hard to say. He certainly seemed
to study them with great interest.

11:38.106 --> 11:40.906
Do you think he's their killer?
I don't know,

11:40.906 --> 11:43.406
but I'm convinced he knows
more than he's saying.

11:43.406 --> 11:46.766
But how do I prove it
after 25 years?

11:46.766 --> 11:49.546
I think I might have something
that will cheer you up.

11:55.666 --> 12:01.626
At first I thought it was a birthmark
or discolouration from having been
in the ground for so long,

12:01.626 --> 12:03.686
but I realised...

12:03.686 --> 12:05.286
It's a tattoo.

12:05.286 --> 12:08.686
Military, perhaps?

12:08.686 --> 12:12.386
You're right, Julia,
this has cheered me up.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.626
Sir? Ah, Murdoch.

12:17.626 --> 12:23.266
I've just received a telegram from
the Times in London, they want to do
a featured article on the mummies.

12:23.266 --> 12:25.066
Word has spread to London, sir?

12:25.066 --> 12:29.606
Can you believe it? Murdoch,
I think these bodies are considerably
more significant than we thought.

12:29.606 --> 12:31.366
You don't say.

12:31.366 --> 12:33.186
What have you got there?

12:33.186 --> 12:38.126
Our male mummy had some kind of
military tattoo on his arm.
Can you identify it?

12:38.126 --> 12:42.766
You're not going to believe this,
sir, but the insignia is of
the Caldwell Rangers,

12:42.766 --> 12:46.346
a Canadian regiment that last fought
in the war of 1812.

12:46.346 --> 12:49.066
1812?

12:49.066 --> 12:55.146
Based on Dr Ogden's estimate of
their ages and my assumption that
he was at least 16 years old

12:55.146 --> 13:02.106
when he joined the regiment in 1812,
the murders had to have occurred
before 1836. That's 60 years ago.

13:02.106 --> 13:04.586
Which puts Horace Mooney
in the clear.

13:04.586 --> 13:06.766
I was certain he knew something.

13:06.766 --> 13:11.126
Toronto wasn't much of a city
back then. Less than 10,000 people.

13:11.126 --> 13:15.666
Would have been quiet and safe,
not this sprawling, foul-smelling
place we live in today.

13:15.666 --> 13:18.986
This is what our murder site would
have looked like back in 1836.

13:18.986 --> 13:22.466
It's all fields west of Spadina,
College Street didn't even exist.

13:23.526 --> 13:24.846
What have you, George?

13:24.846 --> 13:29.666
Sirs, the property was originally
owned by a Samuel and Mary Blake.

13:29.666 --> 13:35.866
They built the house there in 1815,
farmed there until 1850 when the
land was expropriated by the city.

13:35.866 --> 13:38.766
For what? An insane asylum.

13:38.766 --> 13:44.986
But then plans changed, the asylum
was built on Queen Street and
the land was auctioned in 1852...

13:44.986 --> 13:47.366
To Horace Mooney.

13:47.366 --> 13:49.306
Well, that clears things up
somewhat.

13:49.306 --> 13:52.966
One other thing, sirs,
the Blakes had a child, a daughter.

13:52.966 --> 13:56.186
Her married name's Rebecca Hastings.
She's still alive and I have
her address.

14:08.066 --> 14:09.546
Hello!

14:11.206 --> 14:12.866
Mrs Hastings?

14:15.126 --> 14:18.586
Mrs Rebecca Hastings?
Yes? How can I help you?

14:18.586 --> 14:21.306
I'm Detective William Murdoch
of the Toronto Constabulary.

14:21.306 --> 14:23.026
Oh, dear, has something happened?

14:23.026 --> 14:24.646
Oh, goodness, no.

14:24.646 --> 14:28.146
I didn't mean to alarm you.
I just have some questions for you.
Of course.

14:30.886 --> 14:34.186
Are these your grandchildren?
Great-grandchildren, actually.

14:34.186 --> 14:36.866
Charlie Hastings.
Detective William Murdoch.

14:36.866 --> 14:39.346
Now, what can we do for you?

14:39.346 --> 14:42.466
Excuse me, ma'am,
do you teach at the secreta...

14:42.466 --> 14:43.906
Pardon me!

14:43.906 --> 14:46.826
Excuse me, ma'am, do you t...

14:46.826 --> 14:49.166
Pardon me. Pardon.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.526
Oh, of course. Pardon me, ma'am...

14:51.526 --> 14:54.006
Yes, is there a problem, Constable?

14:54.006 --> 14:57.326
Yes. Well, no. I'm here to meet
my cousin, Penny Renton.

14:57.326 --> 14:59.406
She began her first day
of class here...

14:59.406 --> 15:02.026
She absolutely did not.
Classes begin tomorrow.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.686
Are you quite certain, ma'am?

15:03.686 --> 15:05.626
I dropped Penny here this morning.

15:05.626 --> 15:07.886
She must have realised
her mistake and left.

15:10.426 --> 15:12.346
Yes, of course.

15:12.346 --> 15:13.866
Good day, ma'am.

15:19.026 --> 15:21.626
Lovely. Thank you, Mrs Hastings.

15:21.626 --> 15:26.486
I was hoping to speak to you about
your parents, Mr and Mrs Blake.

15:26.486 --> 15:29.546
Goodness me, whatever for?

15:29.546 --> 15:37.286
We recently found two well-preserved
bodies buried on the property they
once owned. That's disturbing news.

15:37.286 --> 15:43.706
It appears the bodies were buried
at a time when your parents still
owned the property, around 1836.

15:43.706 --> 15:46.266
I don't know how I can help you.

15:46.266 --> 15:48.166
I'd left the farm by that time.

15:48.166 --> 15:51.246
And how old were you then? 15.

15:51.246 --> 15:54.826
15? That's rather young to be
off on your own, isn't it?

15:54.826 --> 15:57.026
Oh, I wasn't on my own.

15:57.026 --> 15:58.766
Charlie left with me.

15:58.766 --> 16:02.606
Mr Hastings?
You lived at the home as well?

16:02.606 --> 16:05.966
I was indentured. My parents
couldn't afford to keep me,

16:05.966 --> 16:10.786
so they sent me to the Blake farm
to work in exchange
for food and lodgings.

16:10.786 --> 16:16.226
And your parents must not have taken
too kindly to you being courted
by an indentured servant?

16:16.226 --> 16:20.706
No, they did not.
When we tell them we wanted to marry,

16:20.706 --> 16:25.786
they were very angry. So we left.

16:25.786 --> 16:29.606
And did you keep in touch with
your parents? Not very much.

16:29.606 --> 16:35.186
My mother died shortly after
the sale of the property, my father
followed a couple of years later.

16:35.186 --> 16:39.366
So you have no idea who the people
we found buried might be?

16:39.366 --> 16:44.686
Not at all. I wonder, would you be
willing to look at the bodies?

16:44.686 --> 16:48.806
Perhaps it could trigger
a memory, however small,
that could help us identify them.

16:50.406 --> 16:52.506
Well, if it will help.

16:52.506 --> 16:55.466
SHE SHRIEKS

16:55.466 --> 16:57.866
Oh, those poor people!

16:57.866 --> 17:00.506
They look frozen in time.

17:00.506 --> 17:03.266
Do you recognise them?

17:03.266 --> 17:05.425
I'm trying to think.

17:05.425 --> 17:10.346
Well, I can't say that I've ever
seen them before in my life.

17:10.346 --> 17:14.886
Are you absolutely sure? Yes.

17:16.566 --> 17:19.746
Thank you both for coming,
it's most appreciated.

17:29.166 --> 17:33.286
You don't need to pull on me,
I can walk on my own!

17:33.286 --> 17:35.826
I found her in Allan Gardens. What?!

17:35.826 --> 17:39.246
I can't believe you sent the police.
She was talking with a young man.

17:39.246 --> 17:41.126
What?!
I was merely asking for directions.

17:41.126 --> 17:45.606
Penny Elizabeth Harriet Renton,
what were you thinking?
You could have been harmed. I...

17:45.606 --> 17:49.686
I don't want to hear it. I went
to your secretarial school
to pick you up,

17:49.686 --> 17:52.026
only to find that your classes
begin tomorrow.

17:52.026 --> 17:55.766
I'm afraid that in all
the excitement I mixed up the dates.

17:55.766 --> 17:58.746
And you didn't come back
to the station because...?

17:58.746 --> 18:02.986
I was embarrassed. My first day in
the big city and I get it all wrong.

18:02.986 --> 18:04.946
Georgie, please don't be mad at me.

18:04.946 --> 18:06.626
Constable.

18:06.626 --> 18:08.266
Are you hungry?

18:18.426 --> 18:22.106
I've got some bread and some cheese.

18:24.306 --> 18:26.666
I'll get you something warmer
in a little bit.

18:29.026 --> 18:30.866
Sir?

18:30.866 --> 18:33.966
I found something I believe you will
find intriguing. Yes, George?

18:33.966 --> 18:37.506
Well, I looked into
the Caldwell Rangers and I found
an officers list.

18:37.506 --> 18:41.646
That fellow who used to own the
property, Samuel Blake, is on it.
Really?

18:41.646 --> 18:47.666
Sir, it would be my guess that the
buried bodies are those of Samuel
and Mary Blake. Very good, George.

18:47.666 --> 18:51.766
Which means we have identified our
mummies - Rebecca Hastings' parents.

18:51.766 --> 18:56.426
Yes, but it also means Charlie
and Rebecca Hastings lied to me.

19:01.692 --> 19:05.152
The bodies you saw in the morgue
were those of your parents,
Mrs Hastings.

19:05.152 --> 19:08.952
There's no way
you couldn't have known that.
They looked so different,

19:08.952 --> 19:11.472
and it's been such a long time.

19:11.472 --> 19:14.172
I simply didn't recognise them.

19:14.172 --> 19:18.412
You told me your parents died
after the sale of the property.
That was in 1850.

19:18.412 --> 19:20.732
You lied to me. Why?

19:20.732 --> 19:23.032
Did you murder them? Murder?!

19:23.032 --> 19:25.872
No! Charlie?

19:25.872 --> 19:27.872
Rebecca, we need
to tell him the truth.

19:30.432 --> 19:36.172
You were right,
we didn't leave the farm.
It was my parents who left.

19:36.172 --> 19:40.452
At least, that's what we thought
until you showed us their bodies.

19:40.452 --> 19:43.232
When did they leave?

19:43.232 --> 19:45.212
Round 1836.

19:45.212 --> 19:47.472
They just disappeared.

19:47.472 --> 19:49.132
We never saw them again.

19:49.132 --> 19:50.872
And you never went
to the authorities?

19:50.872 --> 19:53.532
What authorities?

19:53.532 --> 19:56.132
There were no police then
the way there are now.

19:56.132 --> 19:58.692
At least none that you could trust,
at any rate.

19:58.692 --> 20:02.992
We knew something must have
happened to them, but we never
had any idea what.

20:02.992 --> 20:07.792
We impersonated my parents
by forging their signatures
on the sales documents.

20:09.392 --> 20:11.612
And we always feared
this day would come.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.672
Are you going to arrest us?

20:15.672 --> 20:18.692
Not for forgery, no.

20:18.692 --> 20:22.192
But I am conducting
a murder investigation.

20:25.232 --> 20:27.132
Oh, sir?

20:27.132 --> 20:32.092
According to the House of Industry
Records, Charlie Hastings was not
the only indentured child

20:32.092 --> 20:35.672
living at the Blakes'
when they disappeared.
There were three other children.

20:35.672 --> 20:37.232
Really? Still living?

20:37.232 --> 20:41.072
All of them, sir,
including one Horace Mooney.

20:41.072 --> 20:43.872
Find them and bring them in
for questioning. Sir.

20:47.312 --> 20:49.272
Sir?

20:49.272 --> 20:51.912
Sir?

20:51.912 --> 20:55.512
Sorry to disturb you, sir,
but you have a telephone call.

20:55.512 --> 20:59.032
Another reporter? This one's
from the New York Times, sir.

20:59.032 --> 21:01.052
New York Times?

21:01.052 --> 21:02.752
Put it through. Right away.

21:07.592 --> 21:13.792
Pardon me. Excuse me,
I received a note at the university
that I should come down here at once.

21:13.792 --> 21:16.832
My name is Michael Webster. No?!

21:16.832 --> 21:18.332
Excuse me, ma'am?

21:20.432 --> 21:23.232
Why, it is you!

21:23.232 --> 21:26.072
You little turkey!

21:26.072 --> 21:31.312
No-one has called me that...
Alice?!

21:31.312 --> 21:34.952
I really don't know what more
I can tell you people, constable.

21:34.952 --> 21:37.692
We just have a few more questions,
Mr Mooney.

21:37.692 --> 21:41.312
Horace! It's Michael, and Alice.

21:43.792 --> 21:46.472
My goodness!

21:46.472 --> 21:50.212
Horace! It's a strange place for
a reunion, but I'll take it!

21:50.212 --> 21:55.352
Now, what in the world did they
drag us all down here for?

21:58.852 --> 22:05.192
Mr Mooney, you say that you didn't
recognise the bodies of Samuel and
Mary Blake, yet you lived with them.

22:05.192 --> 22:07.372
I didn't recognise them.

22:07.372 --> 22:10.712
The last time I laid eyes on them,
I was five years old.

22:10.712 --> 22:14.892
And then they left.
Did you not wonder where they went?

22:14.892 --> 22:17.772
To be honest, not really.
I was glad.

22:17.772 --> 22:19.632
They were horrible.

22:19.632 --> 22:22.152
They just upped and left,
as I recall.

22:22.152 --> 22:24.732
And you never heard from them
again, Miss Nugent?

22:24.732 --> 22:28.592
No. And I didn't care one whit.

22:28.592 --> 22:31.432
That was a...
That was a cold thing to say.

22:31.432 --> 22:34.312
They were, for all intents
and purposes, your parents.

22:34.312 --> 22:37.392
My parents died when I was 10,
the Blakes were my keepers.

22:37.392 --> 22:39.932
You felt bitter about working
for food and board?

22:39.932 --> 22:45.432
I was bitter about 18 hours
of farm work a day,
and the beatings to top it off.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.992
Beatings?

22:46.992 --> 22:51.692
They were mean, those Blakes. Never
a smile or a kind word from them.

22:51.692 --> 22:54.792
Yet years later,
you bought the house.

22:54.792 --> 22:57.632
Why would you do that if there were
such terrible memories?

22:57.632 --> 23:02.332
Because after the Blakes disappeared
there were nothing
but good memories.

23:02.332 --> 23:06.832
Rebecca and Charlie became like
a mother and father to us.
We were family.

23:06.832 --> 23:11.692
Can you tell me anything about
the last time you saw the Blakes?

23:11.692 --> 23:16.352
My last memory is hearing
old man Blake take his belt
to Alice's backside.

23:16.352 --> 23:21.612
I didn't deserve it. He stubbed
his toe on a chair and accused me
of pulling it to the hutch

23:21.612 --> 23:24.472
to steal candy from
the top shelf, but I didn't.

23:24.472 --> 23:26.352
The next morning, they were gone.

23:26.352 --> 23:28.152
Who do you think killed them?

23:28.152 --> 23:29.732
I've no idea.

23:29.732 --> 23:33.312
I'm sorry, detective,
I can't help you with that.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.872
Don't know, don't care.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.112
We were just happy they were gone.

23:39.072 --> 23:40.992
So all their stories match.

23:40.992 --> 23:43.112
They have remarkable memories
for old people.

23:43.112 --> 23:45.292
Except about what happened
to the Blakes.

23:45.292 --> 23:47.232
They could be telling
the truth, sir.

23:47.232 --> 23:51.532
The Blakes could have enemies
that their children didn't
know about. I don't think so.

23:51.532 --> 23:54.732
I think Alice, Horace and Michael
are lying to protect the Hastings.

23:54.732 --> 23:57.752
Or they all did the mean bastards in
to protect each other.

23:57.752 --> 24:01.092
I don't know what's worse,
these sweet old people
killing the Blakes,

24:01.092 --> 24:03.792
or to think of them as
young children, doing the same.

24:03.792 --> 24:06.832
Either way, I think we are finally
getting closer to finding out

24:06.832 --> 24:09.032
what happened in that house
and who was involved.

24:10.092 --> 24:13.632
Off you go, now, ladies.
No loitering. All of you, let's go.

24:13.632 --> 24:15.272
Good evening!

24:15.272 --> 24:17.032
Hello again, ma'am.

24:17.032 --> 24:19.352
Constable, you must be here
to meet Miss Renton.

24:19.352 --> 24:21.912
I am. I have the correct day
today, I hope.

24:21.912 --> 24:25.592
Yes, congratulations, constable.
However, you do not have
the correct time.

24:25.592 --> 24:29.672
Ma'am, if classes end at 4.30,
I'm nearly a full hour early.

24:29.672 --> 24:33.892
Class is over at 3.30, something
you might have checked first.

24:33.892 --> 24:36.232
I'm certain Penny told me 4.30.

24:36.232 --> 24:39.332
Constable, young girls do not have
the capacity to focus.

24:39.332 --> 24:42.632
Their minds wander aimlessly
unless given proper instruction.

24:42.632 --> 24:46.252
Yes, ma'am.
Something I fear you are not doing.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.232
Ma'am, she's usually
a very responsible girl.

24:48.232 --> 24:50.072
You must be responsible for her.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.352
You are her guardian, are you not?

24:52.352 --> 24:53.992
I am, ma'am.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.312
I'll look for her straight away.
Thank you.

24:56.312 --> 25:02.172
Constable, Miss Renton went
in that direction.

25:02.172 --> 25:04.592
Thank you again, ma'am.
You're too kind.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.432
GIGGLING FROM NEXT ROOM

26:01.432 --> 26:03.972
Oh, I don't think so!

26:03.972 --> 26:06.852
Penny, what in God's name
is going on here?!

26:06.852 --> 26:09.792
George! Oh, my gosh!
You get your hands off her!

26:09.792 --> 26:12.472
George, you don't understand!

26:12.472 --> 26:17.052
Oh, I understand! This randy
scoundrel is trying to take advantage
of an innocent young girl!

26:17.052 --> 26:21.292
I'm 16! Sir, I was only...
Oh, yes, I know what you
were only, you goat!

26:21.292 --> 26:23.992
I should have you penned up
in the rams' pasture!

26:23.992 --> 26:27.272
What are you doing?
This...whatever his name is
is under arrest.

26:27.272 --> 26:31.852
For what? Public indecency.

26:31.852 --> 26:33.792
We're indoors.
The curtains are see-through.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.692
What has that to do with anything?

26:35.692 --> 26:39.332
Well, it means that any member of the
public could witness this indecency.

26:39.332 --> 26:43.472
Now get a move on.
George Crabtree, you let him go!

26:58.252 --> 27:00.832
Penny, I'm doing this
for your own good.

27:00.832 --> 27:02.972
Clarence is my true love!

27:02.972 --> 27:06.232
Don't be ridiculous!
You arrived two days ago,
you have only just met.

27:06.232 --> 27:08.072
I've known him six months.

27:08.072 --> 27:12.152
You came here to be with a boy?
The school was just a ruse?

27:12.152 --> 27:17.712
It was not, I came to do both. Oh!
Penny, calm down. You know your
cousin has every right to be upset.

27:17.712 --> 27:20.992
Thank you. Er, you're not allowed
to speak! No more speaking from you!

27:20.992 --> 27:23.572
George, is everything all right?

27:23.572 --> 27:27.452
Sir, forgive me for the disturbance,
I was just making an arrest.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.072
Sir, a man just phoned
from the demolition site,

27:32.072 --> 27:34.852
it seems another body's been
discovered there. What?!

27:34.852 --> 27:38.852
As if two adults aren't bad enough,
someone dumps a child
like a piece of rubbish.

27:38.852 --> 27:41.412
Something's different here, sir.

27:41.412 --> 27:43.812
I don't believe
this body was dumped.

27:43.812 --> 27:47.312
The child is dressed in baptismal
gowns and wrapped in blankets.

27:47.312 --> 27:51.612
It was buried with love. If there's
love in that grave, I don't see it.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.152
Perhaps the Blakes had
a second child.

27:55.152 --> 27:56.972
That's unlikely.

27:56.972 --> 28:01.892
Mary Blake had undergone a
hysterectomy due to postpartum
haemorrhaging after Rebecca's birth.

28:01.892 --> 28:05.912
It's no coincidence that the body
was buried just a few yards
away from the Blakes.

28:05.912 --> 28:07.512
So whose baby is it?

28:09.752 --> 28:11.232
I believe I know.

28:20.592 --> 28:21.572
That's enough.

28:25.152 --> 28:26.972
This was your child, then?

28:26.972 --> 28:30.272
We named him Martin.

28:30.272 --> 28:33.612
He was just six months old when he...

28:33.612 --> 28:37.072
He died of congenital heart failure,
there's nothing you could
have done.

28:39.052 --> 28:45.272
Why did you bury him like you did?
We were just children ourselves.

28:47.032 --> 28:51.152
Frightened we did something wrong.

28:52.952 --> 28:57.332
Constable, please escort
the Hastings back to the station,
they're to be charged with murder.

28:57.332 --> 28:59.832
Oh, no!

28:59.832 --> 29:01.752
No, no, no, no, no!

29:09.532 --> 29:11.952
William!

29:11.952 --> 29:14.512
The child died of natural causes.

29:14.512 --> 29:17.312
And was buried less than 10 feet
away from the Blakes.

29:17.312 --> 29:19.192
That was no coincidence.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.632
So if they buried the Blakes...

29:24.632 --> 29:26.392
Then they murdered them as well.

29:33.052 --> 29:36.452
Mr Hastings, you have lied to me
at every turn.

29:36.452 --> 29:40.152
Yes. We buried them,
but we didn't kill them.

29:40.152 --> 29:42.372
We were trying to kill ourselves.

29:42.372 --> 29:46.912
I don't understand.
Rebecca and I had fallen in love.

29:46.912 --> 29:51.232
We kept it a secret,
but when Rebecca became pregnant,
we had to tell the Blakes.

29:51.232 --> 29:57.912
Mother and father were enraged. They
threatened to have Charlie arrested
on trumped-up charges of theft.

29:57.912 --> 30:01.292
And they wanted Rebecca to take
something to get rid of the baby.

30:01.292 --> 30:03.652
We would have run away,
but we had nowhere to go.

30:03.652 --> 30:07.652
Rebecca told me to leave, but I
wasn't going to abandon her to them.

30:07.652 --> 30:13.532
We saw no way out of the situation.
Except for suicide? Yes.

30:13.532 --> 30:16.912
And how were you planning to do it?

30:16.912 --> 30:21.652
The Blakes used cyanide on their
farm as pesticide. I stole some.

30:21.652 --> 30:26.232
We made a draught with the cyanide
and put it in an old laudanum bottle.

30:26.232 --> 30:31.432
Rebecca's parents
had the habit of taking laudanum
every night to help them sleep.

30:31.432 --> 30:35.172
We planned to use some of
their laudanum in our poison,

30:35.172 --> 30:38.332
with the mind of making
our deaths less painful.

30:38.332 --> 30:41.552
We said our goodbyes and fell asleep.

30:44.472 --> 30:46.732
But in the morning, you awoke?

30:46.732 --> 30:50.672
We...we had no idea
why it didn't work.

30:50.672 --> 30:52.932
Until we saw my parents.

30:55.632 --> 31:00.452
That's when I realised
I'd made a terrible mistake,

31:00.452 --> 31:05.892
I'd inadvertently switched
the cyanide with the laudanum.

31:05.892 --> 31:08.172
The bottles were identical.

31:08.172 --> 31:11.652
We were so frightened. We panicked,
buried the bodies in the backyard

31:11.652 --> 31:15.952
and told the children that
the Blakes had just up and left.

31:22.412 --> 31:25.732
If Charlie had accidentally
switched the bottles,

31:25.732 --> 31:29.452
then the Blakes would have ingested
laudanum as well as cyanide.

31:29.452 --> 31:33.992
Would the laudanum still be
in their bodies? It would be.

31:33.992 --> 31:36.752
But it isn't?

31:36.752 --> 31:39.452
Just cyanide.

31:39.452 --> 31:42.352
I'm afraid they're lying. Oh.

31:42.352 --> 31:44.412
And I wanted so much
to believe them.

31:44.412 --> 31:46.792
Yes, it's a shame.

31:46.792 --> 31:49.032
What will happen to the Hastings?
Will they hang?

31:50.672 --> 31:52.952
If you'll please excuse me, Julia.

32:03.012 --> 32:06.172
There was no laudanum found
in the Blakes' bodies.

32:06.172 --> 32:10.492
You never switched the bottles
and this was no accident.

32:10.492 --> 32:12.552
But what we told you was...

32:12.552 --> 32:14.472
The truth?

32:14.472 --> 32:17.792
I think one of you had something
to do with the Blakes' death,

32:17.792 --> 32:22.532
I'm not sure which one,
and perhaps you never even
admitted it to one another.

32:22.532 --> 32:26.672
But don't you think it's time
to set the record straight?

32:34.402 --> 32:36.082
Arrest me.

32:37.182 --> 32:40.422
I will not. George Crabtree,
you arrest me right now!

32:40.422 --> 32:45.342
For what? I, too, was undressed
and about to engage in carnal acts.

32:45.342 --> 32:49.402
Penny, you came here and asked to
stay with me under false pretences.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.762
We plan to be married,
George, I love him!

32:51.762 --> 32:54.602
Penny, you are 16,
you don't know what love is.

32:54.602 --> 32:57.722
That's practically an adult.
You're behaving like a child.

32:57.722 --> 33:01.342
You're the one who arrested
Clarence for no reason,
just because you're angry.

33:01.342 --> 33:06.662
I'm begging you, let him go. He put
you in a compromising position and
I have to charge him accordingly.

33:06.662 --> 33:11.562
But that will go on his permanent
record. He wants to attend medical
school, it will destroy his life.

33:11.562 --> 33:17.142
If I go home and promise not
to see him again, will you
please let him go?

33:17.142 --> 33:18.762
What about your schooling?

33:18.762 --> 33:20.202
I'll make other arrangements.

33:20.202 --> 33:23.722
I love him, I won't let you ruin
his life just because of me.

33:23.722 --> 33:25.962
Please, George, let him go.

33:32.922 --> 33:37.982
Either they both did it or one of
them did it. So charge them both.
We don't have enough evidence,

33:37.982 --> 33:41.322
and no jury would ever convict
them, a sweet old couple like that.

33:41.322 --> 33:45.622
Age is no reason for amnesty,
Murdoch, you said it yourself.

33:45.622 --> 33:47.382
I'm aware of that, sir.

33:47.382 --> 33:53.282
But let's say one of them did switch
the bottles and the other one is
innocent, that's reasonable doubt.

33:53.282 --> 33:56.362
And if they stick to their story,
well... So break their story.

33:56.362 --> 34:00.342
Interrogate them separately, get one
of them to confess. By what means?

34:00.342 --> 34:02.702
You'll figure it out.

34:02.702 --> 34:05.162
You can solve this, Murdoch,
I know you can.

34:07.562 --> 34:09.542
Thank you, sir.

34:09.542 --> 34:12.641
Sir, the reporter from the
New York Times is on the line.

34:12.641 --> 34:15.062
He wants to confirm your interview
at eight.

34:15.062 --> 34:18.101
Excellent, good. An interview, sir?

34:18.101 --> 34:21.982
With a reporter? He came all the way
from New York to pursue this story.

34:21.982 --> 34:27.842
Which story would that be? The
discovery of mummified remains, or
the subsequent murder investigation?

34:27.842 --> 34:30.661
Both. Well, you can't tell one
without the other, can you?

34:30.661 --> 34:33.942
Ah, so you would like
a satisfactory outcome?

34:33.942 --> 34:37.502
Of course, don't you?
The eyes of the world's press
are upon us, Murdoch.

34:37.502 --> 34:42.982
Sir, given your distaste for
the press, perhaps I should take
this interview off your hands?

34:42.982 --> 34:45.322
That's very kind of you,

34:45.322 --> 34:48.222
but I think this case needs you more.

34:48.222 --> 34:52.641
Excuse me, sirs, Charlie Hastings
would like to speak with you.

34:56.681 --> 35:01.142
I killed the Blakes.

35:01.142 --> 35:03.742
I switched the bottles on purpose.

35:05.362 --> 35:11.062
I didn't put any laudanum in, just
went in and switched the two bottles.

35:11.062 --> 35:14.742
I meant to do it.
 I wanted them dead.

35:19.262 --> 35:21.782
Are you willing to put
your confession to paper?

35:21.782 --> 35:27.562
Yes, just as long as you understand,
I did this alone.

35:27.562 --> 35:30.762
Rebecca had nothing to do with it.

35:37.222 --> 35:42.282
George, can you join me with a pen
and paper? We need to draw up
a confession for Mr Hastings.

35:42.282 --> 35:45.882
Sir, Rebecca Hastings
is asking for you.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.642
I've put her in the interview room.

35:52.922 --> 35:54.842
I killed my parents.

35:54.842 --> 35:56.362
You did?

35:56.362 --> 35:59.902
I couldn't go along with the suicide.

35:59.902 --> 36:03.202
I wanted to live with Charlie,
not die with him,

36:03.202 --> 36:06.142
but I knew he would never have
gone along with my new plan.

36:06.142 --> 36:07.682
Which was?

36:07.682 --> 36:10.922
I switched the cyanide
with the laudanum.

36:10.922 --> 36:12.602
I killed my parents.

36:14.182 --> 36:17.042
I see.

36:18.922 --> 36:21.962
So if they both switched
the bottles,

36:21.962 --> 36:26.902
the second switch would have
cancelled out the first one, so they
can't both be telling the truth.

36:26.902 --> 36:29.242
That means one of them gave
a false confession.

36:29.242 --> 36:32.542
If Rebecca switched the bottles and
Charlie mixed the two concoctions,

36:32.542 --> 36:35.362
they would have also gotten
a dose of the cyanide.

36:35.362 --> 36:37.322
They would have died
along with the Blakes.

36:38.982 --> 36:41.962
But if Charlie alone
switched the bottles,

36:41.962 --> 36:44.222
then they live and the Blakes die.

36:44.222 --> 36:47.042
So Charlie's our man?

36:47.042 --> 36:50.262
Unless...
What if they're both lying?

36:50.262 --> 36:54.922
I mean, what if Charlie is
confessing to save Rebecca, Rebecca
is confessing to save Charlie?

36:54.922 --> 36:57.882
Maybe they're making that sacrifice
for each other.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.962
But if they're both lying...

36:59.962 --> 37:03.602
It means they are both telling the
truth. About the suicide, that is.

37:03.602 --> 37:07.322
Oh, but then the Blakes would have
had laudanum in their stomachs.
Which they didn't.

37:09.542 --> 37:12.122
What if one of the other children
made the switch?

37:12.122 --> 37:13.882
Bloody hell, Crabtree!

37:13.882 --> 37:17.182
We've solved it, it's Charlie.
What did you say?

37:17.182 --> 37:20.182
I don't know, what if one of the
other children switched the bottles?

37:20.182 --> 37:23.442
Sir, he has a point.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.362
George, bring everyone back in here.

37:28.242 --> 37:34.182
Mrs Hastings, you claim that
you switched the laudanum bottle,
unbeknownst to anyone else.

37:34.182 --> 37:37.162
But I believe that you're simply
protecting your husband.

37:37.162 --> 37:39.362
That's not true! It is.

37:39.362 --> 37:43.042
And I also believe that Mr Hastings
is doing the same on your behalf.

37:45.602 --> 37:50.302
He's right. Now, that leaves
the other children in the household.

37:50.302 --> 37:54.342
All of you had both motive
and opportunity.

37:54.342 --> 37:58.082
The Blakes were so awful that you
can barely speak of it, Mr Webster.

37:58.082 --> 38:04.162
Mrs Nugent, you suffered a beating
on the evening that the Blakes died.

38:04.162 --> 38:07.422
And then there's little
Horace Mooney, who claims

38:07.422 --> 38:10.722
to barely remember a thing
because he was only five.

38:10.722 --> 38:13.502
You were the youngest
and also the smallest.

38:13.502 --> 38:17.982
Now, can anyone tell me on
this diagram where the laudanum
bottle was kept?

38:17.982 --> 38:21.522
Right here in the hutch,
on the shelf. Which shelf?

38:21.522 --> 38:23.402
The middle shelf.

38:23.402 --> 38:27.362
The middle shelf.

38:27.362 --> 38:31.782
Now, Mrs Nugent, you suffered
a beating on that fateful evening

38:31.782 --> 38:35.782
because Mr Blake thought
you had been stealing candy.

38:35.782 --> 38:39.162
Where was the candy kept?
On the top shelf.

38:39.162 --> 38:40.842
The top shelf.

38:44.562 --> 38:47.562
And why was it kept
on the top shelf?

38:47.562 --> 38:49.962
Because I could reach the others.

38:49.962 --> 38:54.942
You could reach the others.
Including the shelf
where the laudanum was kept? Yes.

38:54.942 --> 39:00.802
So in that case, you didn't need
a chair to reach the laudanum bottle
and switch it? No.

39:00.802 --> 39:04.402
But there was a chair there
that evening, wasn't there?

39:04.402 --> 39:06.262
Yes.

39:06.262 --> 39:09.822
Was the chair there when you
changed the bottle, Mr Hastings?

39:09.822 --> 39:16.362
I don't recall. No, if it was,
I would have put it back.

39:16.362 --> 39:19.902
So what was the chair doing there?

39:19.902 --> 39:27.602
The only person who would have
needed the chair to reach the lower
shelf where the laudanum was kept

39:27.602 --> 39:29.962
was little Horace Mooney.

39:32.742 --> 39:36.962
But how could you say that?
That's a ridiculous notion.

39:36.962 --> 39:38.562
He's right.

39:45.142 --> 39:47.702
I don't remember much
about that age,

39:47.702 --> 39:52.022
but I do remember that night.

39:53.502 --> 39:58.782
I overheard Charlie and Rebecca,
they were talking about going away.

39:58.782 --> 40:00.922
You overheard them
planning their suicide.

40:04.322 --> 40:08.182
They saw how scared I was, so they
told me they were just taking

40:08.182 --> 40:12.602
a magic disappearing potion that
would make them go away for a while.

40:12.602 --> 40:17.842
We told him it was similar
to the "happy potion"
the Blakes drank each night.

40:17.842 --> 40:20.222
The laudanum. Yes.

40:20.222 --> 40:23.922
But you didn't want them
to disappear, did you?

40:23.922 --> 40:26.842
No.

40:26.842 --> 40:30.582
That night, I stole into their room

40:30.582 --> 40:35.082
with a fresh bottle of happy potion
from the cellar, which I...

40:35.082 --> 40:37.702
I put in place of the...

40:37.702 --> 40:40.842
..what I presumed to be
the disappearing potion.

40:40.842 --> 40:45.822
So when I switched the laudanum
with the cyanide, I was only...

40:45.822 --> 40:48.382
Adding laudanum to laudanum.

40:48.382 --> 40:51.882
I made sure that Charlie
and Rebecca didn't disappear.

40:51.882 --> 40:54.122
But that wasn't enough,
was it, Mr Mooney?

40:54.122 --> 40:57.062
I was afraid that as long
as the Blakes were around,

40:57.062 --> 41:00.522
Charlie and Rebecca would try
to disappear again.

41:00.522 --> 41:08.402
So you gave the Blakes Charlie and
Rebecca's disappearing potion,
the one that contained cyanide.

41:08.402 --> 41:13.482
After Charlie left,
you replaced the laudanum bottle
with the disappearing potion.

41:13.482 --> 41:16.682
But to reach it,
you had to drag a chair over,

41:16.682 --> 41:18.502
and that's where you left it.

41:18.502 --> 41:21.402
I was too young to understand
what "disappearing" meant.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.382
The next day,

41:26.382 --> 41:30.162
Charlie and Rebecca told us
that the Blakes had gone

41:30.162 --> 41:34.842
and they were going to be
taking care of us.

41:34.842 --> 41:36.542
I guess the potion worked.

41:36.542 --> 41:39.362
Horace, you kept
this secret all this time?

41:39.362 --> 41:43.462
That must have been a heavy load
for such a young man.

41:43.462 --> 41:45.342
I never gave it much thought.

41:45.342 --> 41:49.542
It was years before I understood
what I'd done, and...

41:51.602 --> 41:55.802
..I can't say I regret it.
What's going to happen to Horace,
detective?

41:59.202 --> 42:03.782
Well, we can't very well convict a
man for misunderstanding the meaning

42:03.782 --> 42:07.722
of a word when he was five years old,
can we? No, sir, we can't.

42:07.722 --> 42:08.682
Truly?

42:10.742 --> 42:12.662
You mean I'm free to go?

42:12.662 --> 42:15.922
You are. You all are.

42:31.222 --> 42:34.622
Sir? It's almost eight o'clock,
you asked me to remind you.

42:34.622 --> 42:38.202
Bloody hell, what will I tell
the New York Times now?

42:38.202 --> 42:41.042
That we've solved the case
but not made any arrests?

42:41.042 --> 42:45.962
Well, sir, you could always dazzle
them with scientific information
about the details of mummification.

42:45.962 --> 42:49.382
When have you ever heard me use
a scientific term in a sentence?

42:49.382 --> 42:52.382
You'll be fine, sir,
just stick to the facts.

42:52.382 --> 42:56.082
You should get a move on, sir.
How do I look? Really?

42:56.082 --> 42:58.162
You look very handsome, sir.

43:16.062 --> 43:18.442
Penny! Clarence!
All right, not so fast.

43:18.442 --> 43:21.702
Now, listen, I know you say
you're in love... We are in love!

43:21.702 --> 43:25.402
I believe you. I just don't want
you to rush into anything.

43:25.402 --> 43:27.482
So I've written a list of conditions.

43:30.302 --> 43:35.122
"Until you should decide to get
married, you have to agree
to be chaperoned at all times."

43:36.882 --> 43:38.882
Is that all?

43:38.882 --> 43:43.082
That's a sacrifice that two people
in love would be willing to make.
Do you agree?

43:43.082 --> 43:46.282
I do. I do, too. Thank you, Georgie!

43:46.282 --> 43:48.022
I'll treat her well, sir.

43:52.922 --> 43:55.602
All right, that's enough, now.
This is my workplace.

44:01.362 --> 44:04.562
I wonder how the inspector's
interview is faring.

44:04.562 --> 44:06.482
Very well, I should think.

44:06.482 --> 44:10.842
He is surprisingly sentimental
about romantic stories like this,
he'll do it justice.

44:10.842 --> 44:13.002
You find this romantic?

44:13.002 --> 44:14.682
Certainly.

44:14.682 --> 44:18.062
Out of adversity grew
a family, of sorts.

44:18.062 --> 44:20.842
It's important to you,
isn't it, family?

44:20.842 --> 44:22.762
Oh, yes.

44:22.762 --> 44:25.542
My family life was so erratic,

44:25.542 --> 44:30.262
I suppose it made me crave my own
close-knit family some day.

44:30.262 --> 44:32.822
You deserve such happiness.

44:34.642 --> 44:39.322
As do you. If that's what you want.

44:41.142 --> 44:46.482
Is that what you want?
Yes. Yes, of course.
