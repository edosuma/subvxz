00:27.133 --> 00:29.001
<i>Here's the thing about
living with all women.</i>

00:29.003 --> 00:32.168
<i>There's constant
crying in the house.</i>

00:32.171 --> 00:33.739
<i>And they hate it
when I do that.</i>

00:33.741 --> 00:36.240
<i>It's like, first of all, you
know what I'm going through.</i>

00:36.242 --> 00:37.910
All right, you guys ready
for your first comedian?

00:37.912 --> 00:38.977
<i>Let me hear it.</i>

00:38.979 --> 00:42.414
<i>Please give it up
for Nina Geld!</i>

00:42.416 --> 00:45.284
It's incredible, the things
us women could be getting done

00:45.286 --> 00:47.486
if we weren't always
defending ourselves

00:47.488 --> 00:48.820
from men trying to fuck us

00:48.822 --> 00:50.491
all the time.

01:03.904 --> 01:06.038
<i>Peace between Israel
and Palestine,</i>

01:06.040 --> 01:07.739
<i>or Syria, or Saudi Arabia,
or whatever.</i>

01:07.741 --> 01:09.341
<i>We could have fixed that
a long time ago,</i>

01:09.343 --> 01:11.243
<i>but a bunch of dudes that just
couldn't stop thinking about</i>

01:11.245 --> 01:13.645
<i>fucking that hot
Israeli translator.</i>

01:13.647 --> 01:14.782
<i>Just fuck!</i>

01:16.550 --> 01:20.018
<i>When I think about all the amazing
things men could have accomplished,</i>

01:20.020 --> 01:22.323
<i>if you weren't just trying
to fuck us all the time.</i>

01:23.857 --> 01:26.325
<i>You've made a breakthrough.</i>

01:26.327 --> 01:29.227
<i>You're about to find
the cure of cancer.</i>

01:29.229 --> 01:32.065
<i>But, ah, you just wanna
fuck your lab assistant.</i>

01:32.067 --> 01:33.665
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:33.667 --> 01:35.935
<i>Did you know, that's why we
haven't found a cure for cancer?</i>

01:35.937 --> 01:37.636
<i>It's because of
fucking lab assistants.</i>

01:39.239 --> 01:41.442
<i>You ready to see
a cool comic?</i>

01:42.476 --> 01:43.875
<i>This is fucking bullshit.</i>

01:43.877 --> 01:45.611
<i>Fucking girl comic.</i>

01:45.613 --> 01:47.312
<i>Why do I wanna fuck her?</i>

01:49.084 --> 01:52.184
<i>Because you always
want to fuck her.</i>

01:52.186 --> 01:54.119
<i>Remember that time you were
supposed to help your friend Jamie</i>

01:54.121 --> 01:55.520
<i>with her AP biology test,</i>

01:55.522 --> 01:57.456
<i>but you fucked her instead?</i>

01:57.458 --> 01:59.124
<i>She failed that test.</i>

01:59.126 --> 02:00.827
<i>Instead of graduating,
getting her doctorate</i>

02:00.829 --> 02:02.061
<i>and going on to
solve the energy crisis,</i>

02:02.063 --> 02:04.396
<i>she lives with her mother now
and manages a Lids.</i>

02:06.333 --> 02:08.033
That's on you.

02:08.036 --> 02:10.571
That's on you and
your dumb, dumb dick.

02:13.708 --> 02:17.309
Okay. I know I'm not supposed to
talk about my pussy on stage,

02:17.311 --> 02:19.413
because men never
talk about their dicks,

02:20.447 --> 02:21.848
but here's the thing.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.083
I bleed through my pussy
every month.

02:24.085 --> 02:27.354
In fact, I'm... I'm bleeding
through my pussy right now.

02:28.589 --> 02:30.023
On stage.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.224
And here's something else
you probably don't know.

02:32.226 --> 02:35.028
Just before I get my period
every month,

02:35.030 --> 02:36.863
and over the next
day or two,

02:36.865 --> 02:38.430
I get diarrhea.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.668
I do. And I'm not
the only one either.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.069
It happens to a lot
of us women.

02:43.071 --> 02:44.904
- Okay?
- Whoo! Yeah.

02:44.906 --> 02:48.541
When I go to the bathroom and I'm done
shitting liquid while I check Facebook,

02:48.543 --> 02:53.079
I look down, it's like a scene
from fucking <i>Saving Private Ryan.</i>

02:53.081 --> 02:55.081
It's just like
a massacre in there.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.182
But weirdly no men.

02:57.184 --> 03:00.185
No Matt Damon,
just the all female reboot.

03:00.187 --> 03:02.254
I read there's
a German word for it.

03:02.256 --> 03:03.956
"Bloodshitza."

03:03.958 --> 03:06.392
I bet in Canada
the National Health Service

03:06.394 --> 03:08.596
gives you a fucking day off
for bloodshitza.

03:09.431 --> 03:10.295
Oh, no!

03:10.297 --> 03:11.898
Oh, no. Stay home,
watch some hockey

03:11.900 --> 03:13.368
and just shit that blood out.

03:14.536 --> 03:16.602
Nina Geld, everybody.

03:16.604 --> 03:18.907
She's horny as fuck, right?

03:20.775 --> 03:24.112
Give it up for
our next comic, Mike Hall.

03:26.347 --> 03:28.548
Nina Geld.
Round of applause for her.

03:29.884 --> 03:32.518
I'm supposed to say, like, she's
really funny, but she's hot.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.953
She's red smoking,

03:33.955 --> 03:35.955
oh, my God, take you
out of your game hot,

03:35.957 --> 03:37.824
and I want to fuck her.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.726
She can put me
in a dungeon, tie me up,

03:39.728 --> 03:40.793
and play Phil Collins,

03:40.795 --> 03:44.198
and I would
still be bonerific...

03:45.567 --> 03:47.500
Murderer.

03:47.502 --> 03:48.701
When are you gonna fuck me?

03:48.703 --> 03:50.570
Like, this dance is stupid.

03:50.572 --> 03:53.209
Lose some weight, you fat fuck.
Look at yourself.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.908
If I lose weight
you'll fuck me?

03:55.910 --> 03:57.376
'Cause I'll lose...
I'll lose weight.

03:57.378 --> 03:59.679
You know why I will
really never fuck you, Mike?

03:59.681 --> 04:01.380
It has nothing to do with your weight.
You know why?

04:01.382 --> 04:03.015
No, it has everything to do
with my weight.

04:03.017 --> 04:04.450
I'm a big, fat fuck.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.252
It's because there's not a single
original bone in your body.

04:06.254 --> 04:08.188
I'd like to put an original
bone in your body.

04:08.190 --> 04:10.157
Have fun jacking off
to me tonight, right?

04:10.159 --> 04:12.094
Jacking off to you is gonna
be the best part of my night.

04:12.894 --> 04:14.161
You're filthy.

04:14.163 --> 04:16.930
You are filthy
when I jack off to you.

04:23.705 --> 04:26.140
We're not driving.
We're taking the Uber chopper.

04:26.142 --> 04:27.607
Have you guys checked
that out yet?

04:27.609 --> 04:30.179
Look, man. It should be a good weekend.
It gets a little wild.

04:30.946 --> 04:32.114
Uh...

04:34.549 --> 04:36.185
Hi. Wanna buy me
a drink?

04:37.819 --> 04:39.452
You're, uh...
You're forward.

04:39.454 --> 04:42.555
Well, you make more than me,
so it's only fair.

04:42.557 --> 04:43.924
Well, what do you do?

04:43.926 --> 04:45.625
I'm a comedian.

04:45.627 --> 04:46.894
You're a comedian?

04:46.896 --> 04:48.594
So then of course
you'll tell me a joke?

04:48.596 --> 04:50.563
Hmm. No.

04:50.565 --> 04:52.465
No? Well, I don't know
if I want to buy you a drink

04:52.467 --> 04:53.867
if you're not gonna
tell me a joke.

04:53.869 --> 04:55.535
Do you wanna
just go, then?

04:55.537 --> 04:56.669
Do I want to?

04:56.671 --> 04:57.670
Let's go.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.438
Yeah, okay.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.176
So, is this whole, like,
cougar thing common for you?

05:02.178 --> 05:03.609
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:03.611 --> 05:05.913
Did you just say... Did you just use...
Oh, God.

05:05.915 --> 05:07.214
No, did I say that?

05:07.216 --> 05:08.550
- Did you just say cougar?
- No, I didn't.

05:09.151 --> 05:10.383
How am I a cougar?

05:10.385 --> 05:12.318
I swear, I'm like
three years older than you.

05:19.161 --> 05:21.094
- Jesus Christ, Joe.
- Who is this guy?

05:21.096 --> 05:22.229
Hey, who the fuck
is this guy?

05:22.231 --> 05:23.396
Who am I?
Who are you, man?

05:23.398 --> 05:25.098
Jesus... How did you
get in here?

05:25.100 --> 05:26.465
- No...
- What are you...

05:26.467 --> 05:28.237
It doesn't matter
who he is, okay?

05:29.104 --> 05:31.305
Okay. Uh...
I'm gonna go.

05:31.307 --> 05:33.506
- Stay.
- You should fucking leave.

05:33.508 --> 05:34.608
Uh...

05:34.610 --> 05:36.442
Hey, Ken.

05:36.444 --> 05:39.146
I asked you to come up here,
and I want you to stay. Okay?

05:39.148 --> 05:41.684
Okay. Uh, it's Cy actually...

05:42.350 --> 05:43.183
Cy. Fine.

05:43.185 --> 05:44.751
Looks like you already
got a Ken.

05:44.753 --> 05:46.019
That works out.
That's great.

05:46.021 --> 05:47.420
So I'm gonna sit
this one out.

05:47.422 --> 05:48.288
She'll be fine.

05:48.290 --> 05:49.723
Look at that.
You'll be fine.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.091
Works out perfectly.

05:51.093 --> 05:52.526
Good night.

05:52.528 --> 05:54.163
I'm taking these. So...

05:55.030 --> 05:56.665
Thanks a lot, asshole.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.601
Hey, hey.

06:03.038 --> 06:04.872
Fucking shit!

06:04.874 --> 06:06.343
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

06:07.042 --> 06:08.777
Fuck! Goddammit!

06:11.547 --> 06:13.115
Fuck! Nina!

06:13.816 --> 06:15.117
God!

06:29.031 --> 06:30.300
Uh...

06:31.167 --> 06:32.434
I'm gonna call you.

06:33.135 --> 06:34.536
Please don't.

06:47.483 --> 06:50.086
<i>I hear about these set-ups
people do for one another.</i>

06:54.723 --> 06:56.423
<i>It doesn't work for me.</i>

06:56.425 --> 06:58.393
<i>The last significant
relationship I had,</i>

06:58.395 --> 07:00.427
<i>if you can call it that,
was with this guy.</i>

07:00.429 --> 07:01.797
<i>If you can call him that.</i>

07:02.498 --> 07:03.599
<i>Joe.</i>

07:07.337 --> 07:09.705
<i>I got a call from a friend one morning.
She's been raped.</i>

07:10.673 --> 07:12.106
That's not the funny part.

07:12.108 --> 07:13.740
That part was real.

07:13.742 --> 07:16.044
So I go with her
to the cops.

07:16.046 --> 07:19.047
And it's, you know,
not a warm room.

07:19.049 --> 07:21.015
Bunch of old, bloated
white guys being like,

07:21.017 --> 07:22.516
"Well, if you don't
remember nothing,

07:22.518 --> 07:24.321
how do you know
you was raped?"

07:25.754 --> 07:27.223
Woman's intuition.

07:28.657 --> 07:31.558
'Cause my vagina's
blown to pieces.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.627
I swear. If men were
raped as much as women,

07:33.629 --> 07:36.297
there'd be an automatic
death penalty for rapists.

07:36.299 --> 07:37.865
So we gotta go
to The Bronx.

07:37.867 --> 07:39.100
And in walks Joe.

07:39.102 --> 07:40.734
Joe, the guy I mentioned.

07:40.736 --> 07:42.870
<i>He's a breath of
fresh air at this moment,</i>

07:42.872 --> 07:45.708
<i>and just the kind of asshole
I like to ride.</i>

07:48.011 --> 07:49.310
Will you go down
on me, Joe?

07:49.312 --> 07:50.610
- What?
- Will you go down on me?

07:50.612 --> 07:52.113
Yeah. Fuck, yeah.
Of course, I will.

07:52.115 --> 07:53.515
Yeah.

07:53.883 --> 07:55.950
Yeah.

07:55.952 --> 07:58.585
So he drives us to The Bronx,
and he's chatty in the car,

07:58.587 --> 08:00.989
and once he knows
I'm in the business

08:00.991 --> 08:02.056
he starts talking about films.

08:02.058 --> 08:03.458
He's been an extra
for Marty,

08:03.460 --> 08:05.360
he's done comedy,
blah, blah, blah.

08:05.362 --> 08:06.930
As we get out
of the car,

08:07.931 --> 08:10.098
I kid you not,

08:10.100 --> 08:13.436
just as I'm about to take my
friend in for her rape test,

08:14.270 --> 08:17.607
he hands us his headshot.

08:19.042 --> 08:20.577
What do I like
about him?

08:21.811 --> 08:23.244
Nothing.

08:23.246 --> 08:26.282
<i>No, I'm with him
because I'm a fuck up.</i>

08:27.183 --> 08:28.486
<i>He's a joke.</i>

08:29.252 --> 08:31.388
<i>A walking stereotype.
So am I.</i>

08:32.989 --> 08:34.289
What's going on?

08:44.100 --> 08:46.034
At least he's hot.

08:46.036 --> 08:47.702
Fucks me right.

08:47.704 --> 08:49.103
So who cares?

08:49.105 --> 08:51.574
And yes, he hits me.
He's a cop. Duh.

08:55.278 --> 08:56.646
I don't mind it.

08:59.517 --> 09:01.519
It keeps me from falling
asleep during sex.

09:07.657 --> 09:09.023
Thank you.

09:09.025 --> 09:10.261
Good night.

09:33.950 --> 09:35.252
I'll just be a minute.

09:57.007 --> 09:58.006
Can I help you?

10:02.812 --> 10:04.179
Hey, get back here!

10:04.181 --> 10:05.583
Kids, hold on a second.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.683
At least man up to it,
you slut.

10:08.685 --> 10:09.619
Hey!

10:11.754 --> 10:12.822
Hello.

10:13.790 --> 10:14.990
He do that to your face?

10:14.992 --> 10:16.327
'Cause I'm about to
punch you.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.566
I just wanted
to make sure you knew.

10:24.301 --> 10:25.534
Just wanted to make sure
you knew.

10:25.536 --> 10:27.069
Of course, I fucking know.
He's my husband.

10:27.071 --> 10:28.636
You think I'm some
kind of idiot?

10:28.638 --> 10:31.106
He's my husband.
We got two kids.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.475
Well, maybe you can keep
your fucking husband in line.

10:33.477 --> 10:35.210
Okay? 'Cause he keeps
showing up,

10:35.212 --> 10:36.677
and I can't stop fucking him.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.046
So, please!

10:38.048 --> 10:39.148
Do something about it,

10:39.150 --> 10:40.883
'cause I can't fucking
take it anymore.

10:40.885 --> 10:41.986
Then fucking leave.

10:42.887 --> 10:43.986
Maybe I will.

10:43.988 --> 10:45.454
Yeah, good. Go.

10:45.456 --> 10:47.424
Get the hell
off my property.

10:49.994 --> 10:51.293
<i>Hey, Nina. You still there?</i>

10:51.295 --> 10:52.861
Yeah, I'm still on hold.

10:52.863 --> 10:53.896
<i>Sorry, I don't have her right now.
Can we try you back?</i>

10:53.898 --> 10:55.697
No, I don't want her
to call me back.

10:55.699 --> 10:57.533
I want her to get on the phone
whenever she's done taking a shit

10:57.535 --> 10:58.601
or whatever it is
she's doing.

10:58.603 --> 11:00.102
- <i>You wanna stay on the line?</i>
- Yeah.

11:00.104 --> 11:01.906
- <i>Okay, please hold.</i>
- Thank you.

11:02.506 --> 11:03.939
Hey, ducky, ducky.

11:03.941 --> 11:05.009
Hey...

11:06.043 --> 11:08.177
You guys got agents, too?

11:08.179 --> 11:09.512
<i>Hey, Nina.
You're on. Carrie.</i>

11:09.514 --> 11:11.648
Hello? Carrie?
Hey.

11:11.650 --> 11:13.949
<i>Nina, please don't
be rude to my assistant.</i>

11:13.951 --> 11:15.150
I wasn't taking a shit.

11:15.152 --> 11:17.554
I was on another call. That's what I do.
It happens.

11:17.556 --> 11:19.955
Yeah, yeah. I get it.
Listen, um...

11:19.957 --> 11:22.224
Can I still audition
for <i>Comedy Prime?</i>

11:22.226 --> 11:23.759
Oh, my God.

11:23.761 --> 11:24.927
I mean...

11:24.929 --> 11:26.094
I guess you can audition.

11:26.096 --> 11:28.431
But Larry is still gonna
have to see you do stand-up.

11:28.433 --> 11:30.098
That's what he does, okay?

11:30.100 --> 11:32.134
<i>He hates New York though. He's
not gonna go there. He hates it.</i>

11:32.136 --> 11:33.638
Yeah. I'm, um...

11:34.472 --> 11:36.104
I'm moving out there.

11:36.106 --> 11:37.105
I'm sorry, what?

11:37.107 --> 11:38.641
I'm moving to LA.

11:38.643 --> 11:40.677
So can you book me
shows there or what?

11:40.679 --> 11:42.211
<i>I guess.
But I don't know.</i>

11:42.213 --> 11:44.012
Are you gonna show up, or are
you just gonna fuck the doorman

11:44.014 --> 11:45.315
like you did last time?

11:45.317 --> 11:46.651
No, I mean, I'm...

11:47.352 --> 11:49.218
I'm serious this time.

11:49.220 --> 11:50.453
<i>It's not gonna be easy.</i>

11:50.455 --> 11:52.721
- <i>I know.</i>
- It's gonna be lots of hurdles.

11:52.723 --> 11:53.656
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:53.658 --> 11:56.259
You promise me
that you're gonna show up?

11:56.261 --> 11:57.529
I... I promise.

11:57.962 --> 11:59.362
Okay. Well...

11:59.364 --> 12:00.699
I will see what I can do.

12:01.065 --> 12:02.099
<i>Goodbye.</i>

12:09.674 --> 12:11.443
<i>Oh, my goodness. Honey.</i>

12:11.976 --> 12:13.376
I missed you so much.

12:13.378 --> 12:15.278
Oh, my gosh. Is that Nina?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.413
- Oh, hey, Amy.
- Oh, Debora, look at that.

12:17.415 --> 12:18.914
Oh, my gosh.

12:18.916 --> 12:19.948
Hi!

12:19.950 --> 12:21.651
I'm Amy. I'm your
mother's best friend.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.253
I've lived right over here
for years.

12:23.255 --> 12:24.320
Yeah, I know you, Amy.

12:27.024 --> 12:29.259
She hasn't
moved there yet.

12:29.261 --> 12:31.361
Oh, everybody's so tan,
and they run.

12:31.363 --> 12:33.062
Amy, do you remember we
had a conversation

12:33.064 --> 12:35.064
- just about this?
- Yes, I do.

12:35.066 --> 12:36.266
Okay, good.

12:36.268 --> 12:37.866
Why don't I bring over some wine?
What do you prefer?

12:37.868 --> 12:41.671
Amy, bring the wine
over after Nina's gone.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.774
You've got her for a little while.
Treasure her.

12:45.176 --> 12:46.242
Mom.

12:46.244 --> 12:48.046
Mom. Mom, I'm hungry.

12:49.780 --> 12:51.780
- Good, Mom.
- Oh, John.

12:51.782 --> 12:53.383
You looking for some food?

12:53.385 --> 12:54.783
You are so sweet.

12:54.785 --> 12:57.553
It's yummy, so there's no leftover.
I'm so sorry.

12:57.555 --> 12:59.289
I'm so sorry!

12:59.291 --> 13:01.190
Hi. Mom, hi.

13:01.192 --> 13:03.528
I'm here.
I came to visit you.

13:05.063 --> 13:06.231
I'm so glad you're here.

13:16.308 --> 13:17.507
So what do you think, Mom?

13:17.509 --> 13:19.144
You're gonna come
visit me in LA?

13:21.714 --> 13:27.250
I think you are gonna have
a great life out there.

13:27.252 --> 13:29.722
It is gonna be
so fantastic.

13:30.622 --> 13:34.057
I put a little something
together for you,

13:34.059 --> 13:35.628
for your trip to LA.

13:47.072 --> 13:48.438
It's a list.

13:49.575 --> 13:51.307
Of plumbers.

13:51.309 --> 13:53.076
You know,
just in case you need one

13:53.078 --> 13:55.178
where you're staying
if there's no hot water.

13:55.180 --> 13:56.412
It's always good to know.

13:56.414 --> 13:59.683
It's from Angie's list, so they're very...
They're reputable.

13:59.685 --> 14:01.184
So they're good.
They're reputable.

14:01.186 --> 14:03.119
Yeah, thank you.

14:03.121 --> 14:04.688
I know what I wanted to
talk to you about.

14:04.690 --> 14:06.690
I know you're not gonna
lie this, but,

14:06.692 --> 14:09.258
Amy's parents,
they live in LA.

14:09.260 --> 14:10.694
You know,
they're from New Jersey.

14:10.696 --> 14:11.795
They're also Jewish.

14:11.797 --> 14:12.962
They will take care of you.

14:12.964 --> 14:14.931
I'm staying at my agent's
friend's house.

14:14.933 --> 14:16.299
So I'm fine.

14:16.301 --> 14:17.701
Nina, this means
it's gonna happen.

14:17.703 --> 14:20.537
You are gonna be
on <i>Comedy Prime.</i>

14:20.539 --> 14:22.004
This is so exciting!

14:22.006 --> 14:24.842
They have got to hire you.
You are so fanta...

14:24.844 --> 14:27.411
Do you want me to call them for you?
'Cause I will.

14:27.413 --> 14:29.045
Yeah, Mom.
Give 'em a call.

14:29.047 --> 14:29.912
Call 'em up.

14:29.914 --> 14:32.416
You should be on that show.

14:32.418 --> 14:35.184
<i>Blue skies, muted gold...</i>

14:44.397 --> 14:46.397
<i>0.6 miles.</i>

14:46.399 --> 14:48.032
<i>Continue straight.</i>

14:48.467 --> 14:49.899
It's huge.

14:49.901 --> 14:51.368
<i>Turn left.</i>

14:51.370 --> 14:52.969
<i>Turn left.</i>

14:52.971 --> 14:54.173
<i>Right.</i>

14:56.142 --> 14:57.676
<i>Turn right.</i>

15:03.682 --> 15:06.216
<i>You have reached
your destination.</i>

15:36.549 --> 15:38.482
You must be Nina.

15:38.484 --> 15:40.350
<i>Carrie told me
you were coming.</i>

15:40.352 --> 15:43.420
I'm Lake.
My pronouns are she/her.

15:43.422 --> 15:47.059
Sorry. I'm Mexican, and we
don't do the hand thing.

15:47.526 --> 15:48.794
We kiss.

15:49.328 --> 15:50.396
Come here.

15:52.164 --> 15:53.664
Oh!

15:53.666 --> 15:56.937
Come in. I'm gonna
show you the house.

15:58.103 --> 15:59.138
Come.

16:07.213 --> 16:09.613
This place is beautiful.

16:09.615 --> 16:11.281
Thank you.

16:11.283 --> 16:15.085
It's built around that tree
there and the rocks.

16:15.087 --> 16:17.891
As soon as I saw it,
I knew I had to live here.

16:18.959 --> 16:23.028
I used to live on the west side,
but it was too wavy.

16:23.797 --> 16:26.196
I need trees around me.

16:26.198 --> 16:27.665
Hills, roots.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.234
I'm water based,
so I need the balance.

16:30.236 --> 16:34.039
I'm whiskey based,
so that's more my thing.

16:40.747 --> 16:43.783
I feel your energy tired.

16:45.251 --> 16:46.283
Well, I am tired.

16:46.285 --> 16:48.755
So it makes sense
that my energy would be.

16:54.293 --> 16:55.361
What are you doing?

16:56.262 --> 16:57.263
Reiki.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.207
It's so good that you're here.

17:14.781 --> 17:17.079
Come, Nina.

17:17.082 --> 17:18.849
- This is gonna be your room.
- Oh, wow.

17:18.852 --> 17:21.452
- If you like it.
- It's fantastic.

17:21.454 --> 17:22.819
This is gonna be great.

17:22.821 --> 17:24.955
Our fears are gonna sink.

17:24.958 --> 17:26.824
It's gonna be really good.

17:26.826 --> 17:29.294
I love Carrie.
Don't you love her?

17:29.296 --> 17:31.462
Yeah. Well, I mean,
sometimes more than others.

17:31.464 --> 17:34.933
She read my first book
when it was just a manuscript.

17:34.935 --> 17:37.435
I mean, into
the cherry blossom cycle.

17:37.437 --> 17:38.970
- Oh, so you're a writer?
- Yeah.

17:38.972 --> 17:42.006
Yeah, yeah. My 12th book
is coming out next week.

17:42.008 --> 17:44.542
You're into...
Is it <i>Prime...</i>

17:44.544 --> 17:45.743
<i>Comedy Prime,</i> right?

17:45.745 --> 17:47.077
I'm just auditioning.

17:47.079 --> 17:49.249
I gotta come up with material
and stuff, so...

17:50.216 --> 17:51.384
That's so retro.

17:52.786 --> 17:54.285
Hey, I just wanna say
thank you

17:54.287 --> 17:55.787
for putting me up
and everything.

17:55.789 --> 17:57.455
It's really, really cool.
Thank you.

17:57.457 --> 17:58.623
Of course.
Not a problem.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.959
But I do have to
ask you a favor.

18:00.961 --> 18:03.795
I'm organizing this
fundraiser thing tonight,

18:03.797 --> 18:05.496
and my girlfriend is
not in town.

18:05.498 --> 18:06.933
Can you help me
set it up?

18:08.134 --> 18:10.335
Oh, um, I...

18:10.337 --> 18:13.771
You know, I gotta shave.
I gotta wax and...

18:13.773 --> 18:15.141
I should probably.

18:15.575 --> 18:16.843
You wax?

18:18.111 --> 18:19.346
You don't?

18:20.347 --> 18:21.713
No.

18:21.715 --> 18:24.184
Come everyone. Sit down.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.020
Welcome, children.

18:28.022 --> 18:30.321
Thank you for
honoring yourself

18:30.323 --> 18:31.957
by coming here tonight.

18:31.959 --> 18:36.063
My name is Geronimo,
but you can call me Smoky.

18:36.529 --> 18:37.898
What is this, now?

18:38.398 --> 18:39.797
The circle of truth.

18:39.799 --> 18:42.467
Thank you for donating
your time

18:42.469 --> 18:44.103
and your material possessions

18:44.105 --> 18:46.506
to our Topanga Cat Sanctuary.

18:47.374 --> 18:48.706
Cat?

18:48.708 --> 18:49.877
Stay open.

18:51.946 --> 18:54.612
Now, I'd like to begin

18:54.614 --> 18:56.815
by going around the circle

18:56.817 --> 19:00.151
and stating one instance
in which

19:00.153 --> 19:02.489
you saw something
you shouldn't have seen.

19:03.858 --> 19:06.526
This one time,
I saw my girlfriend

19:07.494 --> 19:08.961
shoot up heroin,

19:08.963 --> 19:10.530
and I didn't stop her.

19:11.666 --> 19:12.731
Thank you.

19:12.733 --> 19:14.733
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not doing this.

19:14.735 --> 19:16.602
No, no, no.

19:16.604 --> 19:18.570
Okay, look.
This isn't for everybody.

19:18.572 --> 19:21.372
All right? I don't need to sit
in a circle to own my truth.

19:21.374 --> 19:22.440
I own my truth already.

19:22.442 --> 19:25.445
It's right in here,
just giving me heartburn.

19:26.479 --> 19:28.179
That's beautiful, Nina.

19:28.181 --> 19:32.019
In my 20s, I got into a horrible
argument with my mother.

19:33.054 --> 19:35.054
I called her
a worthless bitch.

19:35.056 --> 19:37.723
She died the next day.

19:37.725 --> 19:39.558
And I've never
forgiven myself.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.794
Thank you, Fred.

19:41.796 --> 19:45.064
Um, but the exercise was

19:45.066 --> 19:48.169
one thing you
shouldn't have seen.

19:49.537 --> 19:50.969
Oh.

19:50.971 --> 19:52.973
I saw my father
hit my mother.

19:56.944 --> 19:58.211
Thank you.

20:06.153 --> 20:07.321
No. No.

20:08.489 --> 20:10.424
No fucking way. Sorry.

20:11.292 --> 20:12.524
Nina...

20:12.526 --> 20:13.625
Yeah...

20:13.627 --> 20:16.395
Lake, some birds
weren't meant to be caged,

20:16.397 --> 20:20.099
but we should still thank them
for their presence.

20:20.101 --> 20:22.067
It just feels like
people get off on it.

20:22.069 --> 20:24.470
Sharing all this personal stuff
and then just

20:24.472 --> 20:25.704
moving on.

20:25.706 --> 20:27.608
I'd love to see your stand-up.

20:28.809 --> 20:30.244
Okay. Okay.

20:31.345 --> 20:32.212
I hear you.

20:32.214 --> 20:34.448
I'm truthful on stage,
but I'm not...

20:37.485 --> 20:40.488
I saw my father hit my mother,
too, when I was a kid, Lake.

20:42.823 --> 20:44.226
- I'm sorry.
- Don't...

20:45.093 --> 20:46.692
See? No, don't do that.

20:46.694 --> 20:48.594
Don't feel sorry for me.

20:48.596 --> 20:50.130
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

20:50.132 --> 20:52.466
You just sound like you
want to have control over...

20:53.667 --> 20:54.900
...everything.

20:54.902 --> 20:56.769
Yeah, that's what art is.

20:56.771 --> 20:58.437
You know, you create
something so that

20:58.439 --> 21:01.442
it has the effect that you
want it to have on others.

21:03.511 --> 21:04.545
Um...

21:05.780 --> 21:07.015
No.

21:08.449 --> 21:10.917
You can't control
every reaction.

21:10.919 --> 21:13.318
You don't know exactly
how people feel.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.822
No, I know if people are
laughing, or if my joke bombed.

21:16.824 --> 21:18.490
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to bother you.

21:18.492 --> 21:20.661
It didn't bother me, okay?
It didn't.

21:23.330 --> 21:24.630
It made me sad.

21:24.632 --> 21:26.700
Oh, it affected you.

21:31.338 --> 21:32.138
What is it?

21:32.140 --> 21:34.774
Cordyceps, reishi and maca.

21:34.776 --> 21:36.410
Is it alive?

21:37.212 --> 21:39.344
It's a super endocrine.

21:39.346 --> 21:40.280
Want some?

21:40.282 --> 21:42.614
You know you're still
gonna die, right?

21:42.616 --> 21:44.186
Try it.

21:47.555 --> 21:49.621
What, what, what? What?

21:52.160 --> 21:53.460
It's a mouse.

21:56.031 --> 21:58.066
I have mouse-phobia.

22:00.001 --> 22:03.337
If I move,
will it kill me?

22:05.207 --> 22:06.172
No.

22:06.174 --> 22:07.640
It's just a tiny rodent.

22:07.642 --> 22:09.843
- Don't make fun of me.
- No, no, no. I'm not.

22:09.845 --> 22:12.245
I respect phobias. Okay?

22:12.247 --> 22:13.713
All right?
Here's what I'm gonna do.

22:13.715 --> 22:15.548
I'm gonna open the door,

22:15.550 --> 22:16.751
gonna let the mouse out.

22:17.752 --> 22:19.120
Come on.

22:25.026 --> 22:27.160
It's gone.

22:27.162 --> 22:28.795
I don't know what
the fuck you're saying,

22:28.797 --> 22:30.830
but I'm sensing
your energy...

22:32.067 --> 22:34.202
...tells me you may have
shit your pants.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.440
Thank you so much for
letting me stay here, Nina.

22:39.841 --> 22:41.142
No problem.

22:44.045 --> 22:46.012
Dating, dating, dating,

22:46.014 --> 22:47.280
dating, dating...

22:47.282 --> 22:48.982
Oh, my God.
It's so boring.

22:48.984 --> 22:50.650
It's such a boring thing
to talk about.

22:50.652 --> 22:53.753
Like, how many comics
have forged careers

22:53.755 --> 22:55.121
just talking about dating?

22:55.123 --> 22:56.756
I guess that's what's
expected of me,

22:56.758 --> 22:57.857
like, as a girl comic.

22:57.859 --> 22:59.626
You wanna hear about
all the embarrassing stories.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.961
Like that time I had
spinach in my teeth,

23:01.963 --> 23:04.265
or my dress got stuck
in my underwear,

23:04.267 --> 23:05.865
my tampon fell out
mid-kiss,

23:05.867 --> 23:07.834
or he was the Zodiac Killer.

23:07.836 --> 23:10.839
And I had spinach in my teeth.
Like, how embarrassing.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.608
Let's get it out of the way.
I don't date.

23:14.210 --> 23:15.441
I don't. I fuck.

23:16.878 --> 23:18.245
Because I don't get it.

23:18.247 --> 23:20.880
I mean, this whole idea that
you gotta go out to dinner,

23:20.882 --> 23:22.182
and let a guy stare
into your eyes

23:22.184 --> 23:23.683
and ask you what
your favorite color is.

23:23.685 --> 23:25.352
For what?

23:25.354 --> 23:29.455
If it works out, you're gonna have plenty
of miserable fucking years to find out.

23:29.457 --> 23:30.823
Right?

23:30.825 --> 23:32.926
Here's what really matters.

23:32.928 --> 23:36.429
What really matters is that
the guy lights you on fire.

23:36.431 --> 23:39.268
Like, look, when he
walks into a room,

23:40.236 --> 23:42.338
does he make your
labia throb,

23:43.039 --> 23:45.372
and your asshole tighten?

23:45.374 --> 23:47.374
You know,
do you feel it?

23:47.376 --> 23:50.413
Does he know
his way around?

23:51.613 --> 23:52.912
Is what I'm saying.

23:52.914 --> 23:54.547
'Cause that's what's
gonna matter.

23:54.549 --> 23:56.616
Eight years down the line, when
you've heard all his stupid jokes,

23:56.618 --> 23:57.884
what's gonna matter

23:57.886 --> 23:59.119
is if he can go down on you

23:59.121 --> 24:01.554
and make you come
before the kids wake up.

24:01.556 --> 24:03.790
It's never really worked for
me, the whole dating thing.

24:03.792 --> 24:05.059
And I've tried.

24:05.061 --> 24:08.862
Like, when I was younger there was
the wine and paint instructor

24:08.864 --> 24:10.763
who finger banged me
to <i>Jackass,</i>

24:10.765 --> 24:12.335
while his roommate slept.

24:13.668 --> 24:16.303
Which was a really
romantic evening.

24:16.305 --> 24:17.704
But if he had trimmed
his nails,

24:17.706 --> 24:20.240
you know, maybe it would
have lasted a little longer.

24:20.242 --> 24:22.475
And another guy, he saved
dolphins for a living

24:22.477 --> 24:25.179
and he was just like a...
a beautiful human being.

24:25.181 --> 24:28.648
But he gagged when
he smelled my pussy.

24:28.650 --> 24:29.515
Actually gagged.

24:29.517 --> 24:31.854
Like, you work with fish
all fucking day.

24:32.822 --> 24:34.656
Go fuck a dolphin,
I'm out.

24:37.126 --> 24:39.026
I went on a
date recently with this guy

24:39.028 --> 24:40.961
who right at
the top of the date

24:40.963 --> 24:42.595
he was like,
"Jenny, you should know

24:42.597 --> 24:45.132
I'm getting millions
of bitcoins right now."

24:45.134 --> 24:49.036
And it's like, you can just tell me
you're gonna try to choke me in bed.

24:49.038 --> 24:51.240
Be straightforward
so I can...

24:58.214 --> 24:59.913
Hey, can I get
a Jack and ginger?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.949
Uh, yeah.
You're a comic, right?

25:01.951 --> 25:03.283
- Yeah.
- Yeah, cool.

25:03.285 --> 25:05.853
So, actually we don't give
free liquor to the comics.

25:05.855 --> 25:06.854
We just do beers.

25:06.856 --> 25:08.122
That's kind of shitty, right?

25:08.124 --> 25:10.224
I'm not actually a bartender.

25:10.226 --> 25:11.392
I'm an improv actor.

25:11.394 --> 25:12.993
So, did you miss
your improv set

25:12.995 --> 25:14.828
with Bob Saget
and Dave Coulier?

25:14.830 --> 25:15.996
Is that supposed to be funny?

25:15.998 --> 25:18.032
It's actually making me kind
of horny how funny you are.

25:18.034 --> 25:19.501
Fuck off, dude.

25:19.503 --> 25:21.268
All right. You can put your
claws away there, Wolverine.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.037
I'm tired, I'm new here.

25:23.039 --> 25:24.406
Would you just
give me a fucking break

25:24.408 --> 25:26.240
and let me pay for
a fucking drink?

25:26.242 --> 25:27.808
It's just like
you're really aggressive.

25:27.810 --> 25:29.176
I'm a little acerbic.

25:29.178 --> 25:30.677
I'll get you a drink.
I'll get you a drink.

25:30.679 --> 25:31.779
Yes, sir.

25:31.781 --> 25:32.713
What are you having?

25:32.715 --> 25:34.451
Oh, now that he comes up
you're gonna get...

25:34.950 --> 25:36.319
What would you like?

25:37.387 --> 25:38.721
What do you want?

25:40.156 --> 25:42.790
Um, I'm trying to get
a Jack and ginger.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.958
Can we have
a Jack and ginger, please?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.294
Absolutely.

25:46.296 --> 25:47.895
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

25:47.897 --> 25:49.997
Yeah, of course,
it's a sexist thing, right?

25:49.999 --> 25:51.266
Yeah.

25:51.268 --> 25:53.000
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

25:53.002 --> 25:54.469
Relax, man.

25:54.471 --> 25:55.636
Cheers.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.638
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:57.640 --> 26:01.141
So, um, you're not working,
are you?

26:01.143 --> 26:02.976
You mean, like a cop?

26:02.978 --> 26:04.678
I hope not, Jesus.

26:04.680 --> 26:07.148
No, I mean like a comic.
You don't have that vibe.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.849
Oh. What vibe is that?

26:08.851 --> 26:11.186
Mmm. Desperate?

26:11.188 --> 26:13.354
And usually pudgy.

26:13.356 --> 26:15.123
You're hot.

26:15.125 --> 26:16.957
Extremely rare for a comic.

26:16.959 --> 26:19.893
So what? You just hang out in clubs and
pick up comedians? Is that what you do?

26:19.895 --> 26:22.830
Actually this is the first time
I've ever been to a comedy club.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.232
It's cool.
Really cool.

26:24.234 --> 26:25.366
And you were...
You were great.

26:25.368 --> 26:26.667
No.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.802
I'm not gonna fuck you,
okay? I'm not.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.072
I'm sorry. I realize it's
a mixed message,

26:31.074 --> 26:33.009
'cause I was just complimenting
you, but, like...

26:33.843 --> 26:34.942
It's not what I do.

26:34.944 --> 26:37.312
I mean, guys come up to me
all the time after sets,

26:37.314 --> 26:39.780
'cause I'm frank
and I talk about sex.

26:39.782 --> 26:42.183
And it's easy to think
I'm into casual sex,

26:42.185 --> 26:44.419
or a freak in bed or whatever,
but I'm not.

26:44.421 --> 26:45.520
Not the casual sex part.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.855
Like, I can be freaky...

26:47.857 --> 26:49.723
- Yeah.
- Whatever. I'm just telling...

26:49.725 --> 26:52.759
- I'm putting it out there.
- You know, you sound like you do on stage.

26:52.761 --> 26:55.130
Either you're not being
honest up there,

26:55.132 --> 26:57.165
or you're not
being honest now.

26:57.167 --> 27:00.734
But you are freaky
sometimes.

27:00.736 --> 27:04.040
So what's the truth?
Like, what's the real you?

27:05.976 --> 27:07.043
I'm...

27:08.178 --> 27:09.613
I'm confused.

27:11.114 --> 27:13.583
Tell you what. We can
figure it out over dinner.

27:15.252 --> 27:16.551
Great.

27:16.553 --> 27:17.651
You still don't believe me.

27:17.653 --> 27:19.320
You don't be...
I'm telling you.

27:19.322 --> 27:21.956
I do. I'm asking you to
dinner, not fucking.

27:21.958 --> 27:23.625
So, what? You're telling me
you're one of those people

27:23.627 --> 27:25.860
that has to like somebody
before you sleep with them?

27:25.862 --> 27:26.828
Is that it?

27:26.830 --> 27:29.063
I mean, I have to like
something about someone.

27:29.065 --> 27:30.832
Something... like ass?

27:30.834 --> 27:32.233
I mean, ass is good.

27:32.235 --> 27:33.568
Nothing the matter
with the ass.

27:33.570 --> 27:36.104
But I mean, you have to have
more than that, you know.

27:36.106 --> 27:39.174
But I'm saying, let's just
take it one step at a time.

27:39.176 --> 27:41.309
Have a drink, talk.

27:41.311 --> 27:43.480
Hi, I'm Rafe.

27:46.816 --> 27:49.350
And I'll have some wine
brought over, on the house.

27:49.352 --> 27:50.921
- Appreciate that.
- Enjoy.

27:51.788 --> 27:53.288
Impressive.

27:53.290 --> 27:54.856
Not what you expected?

27:54.858 --> 27:57.325
Well, I admit, most guys who
come up to me after a show

27:57.327 --> 28:00.261
just offer to buy me
a slice, so...

28:00.263 --> 28:02.567
Ah, now, you deserve
better than that.

28:04.401 --> 28:05.568
Okay, who are you?

28:05.570 --> 28:07.769
Am I supposed to know?
Are you some sort of...

28:07.771 --> 28:10.338
Are you like a motivational
speaker or something?

28:10.340 --> 28:12.006
I'm a contractor.

28:12.008 --> 28:13.611
I'm no longer married.

28:14.445 --> 28:16.614
I was, but she
broke my heart.

28:17.314 --> 28:18.549
But I'm over it.

28:20.518 --> 28:22.917
- What's your last name?
- Hines.

28:22.919 --> 28:25.722
What? Yeah, you wanna make
sure I don't have a record.

28:26.189 --> 28:28.122
Yeah. Yeah.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.358
But I do that with every guy.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.927
- It's not...
- Oh, hundreds of us?

28:31.194 --> 28:32.461
God.

28:32.463 --> 28:34.632
Well, this is
going well already.

28:36.567 --> 28:39.169
- You nervous?
- A little bit, yeah.

28:40.136 --> 28:41.171
Why?

28:43.974 --> 28:47.443
The last time I liked a guy,
I turned out to be really wrong.

28:47.445 --> 28:49.180
Well, how long ago
was that?

28:50.780 --> 28:51.948
Three weeks.

28:52.882 --> 28:53.982
Oh.

28:53.984 --> 28:56.420
I get it. I'm not special.

28:57.255 --> 28:58.554
It's okay. I can handle it.

28:58.556 --> 29:00.322
I knew
I wasn't that special

29:00.324 --> 29:02.426
the day my dad
walked out on me.

29:03.294 --> 29:04.959
Is that a joke, or...

29:04.961 --> 29:07.463
No, I'm just reassuring you
that I already know

29:07.465 --> 29:08.863
that I'm not special.

29:08.865 --> 29:11.133
What is... Have I entered
another dimension?

29:11.135 --> 29:12.334
Is this how guys in LA are?

29:12.336 --> 29:15.072
No, I'm just trying to be honest.
We're being honest.

29:15.905 --> 29:17.673
I don't think you're
really over her.

29:17.675 --> 29:19.441
You're too quick to
say you're over her.

29:19.443 --> 29:20.711
No, I am.

29:29.253 --> 29:30.352
Ah!

29:30.354 --> 29:31.453
You at home now, huh?

29:31.455 --> 29:33.055
I'm feeling
a little bit better.

29:33.057 --> 29:34.223
Yeah, yeah, I see.

29:34.225 --> 29:35.491
I think we need
some water.

29:35.493 --> 29:37.259
What, am I acting
drunk already?

29:37.261 --> 29:39.328
No, you're holding
your liquor well.

29:39.330 --> 29:40.797
We need some water.

29:41.999 --> 29:42.967
Okay.

29:43.701 --> 29:45.036
I'm gonna get that table.

29:45.436 --> 29:47.102
You do that.

29:47.104 --> 29:49.838
Get that. Yes, get that.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.507
Get that.

29:51.509 --> 29:53.044
Can we have some
water, please?

29:56.847 --> 29:58.947
Can you start a tab for me?

29:58.949 --> 30:00.051
Thanks.

30:13.597 --> 30:15.066
Thanks. Hmm.

30:16.567 --> 30:19.236
Girls I know don't have
the balls to talk like you.

30:20.404 --> 30:22.106
Let alone on stage.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.741
I like that.

30:24.743 --> 30:28.611
I mean, it's scary, but
you're not familiar to me.

30:28.613 --> 30:30.412
I can't tell if
that's good or bad.

30:30.414 --> 30:31.683
It's good.

30:32.883 --> 30:34.483
What were the other
girls like?

30:34.485 --> 30:37.252
Ah, they were clingers.

30:37.254 --> 30:38.320
Tight, yeah.

30:38.322 --> 30:39.321
- Tight?
- Tight.

30:39.323 --> 30:40.557
Oh, that's good.

30:40.559 --> 30:44.360
I mean, in certain instances,
yeah, it's good.

30:44.362 --> 30:47.396
You know, you have sex with them
and they move in the next day.

30:47.398 --> 30:49.064
Is that good or bad?

30:49.066 --> 30:50.199
Bad.

30:50.201 --> 30:51.536
- Bad?
- Yeah.

30:52.236 --> 30:53.503
We don't like that.

30:53.505 --> 30:56.608
No. Moving in
the next day?

30:57.274 --> 30:58.541
That's bad.

30:58.543 --> 31:00.844
So, is this it for you?

31:00.846 --> 31:05.314
Like stand-up,
single...

31:05.316 --> 31:09.118
Do you wanna get married or
have children, or any of that?

31:09.120 --> 31:10.320
Um...

31:10.322 --> 31:13.456
I mean, stand-up is
tough to sustain, you know.

31:13.458 --> 31:17.594
But a big part of me wants to
be 80 and still going on stage.

31:17.596 --> 31:19.662
No pants on, just like,

31:19.664 --> 31:21.598
"How is everybody
doing tonight?"

31:21.600 --> 31:24.199
Dentures fall out,
I don't even care.

31:24.201 --> 31:25.735
- I love that.
- Yeah?

31:25.737 --> 31:27.504
But, yeah.
No, I want kids.

31:27.506 --> 31:29.708
I want my own show.
I want...

31:30.709 --> 31:33.410
...a husband who goes
down on me regularly.

31:33.412 --> 31:34.912
I guess that's too much...

31:40.752 --> 31:42.287
What's up?

31:45.457 --> 31:46.991
Yo, what...

31:48.427 --> 31:50.095
- What's up, Ganja?
- Hi.

31:50.928 --> 31:52.362
How you... How you doing?

31:52.364 --> 31:54.531
It's a long time.

31:54.533 --> 31:56.266
I was, um... We...

31:56.268 --> 31:57.369
Dope.

31:58.136 --> 32:00.069
Hi. I'm Ganja.

32:00.071 --> 32:01.072
Hi. Nina.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.374
Hi.

32:03.842 --> 32:05.675
It was...
It was good seeing you.

32:05.677 --> 32:07.277
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.

32:07.279 --> 32:08.611
As far as I'm concerned,

32:08.613 --> 32:10.213
there's still something
going on between us.

32:10.215 --> 32:11.514
You know what?
I'm gonna let you two talk.

32:11.516 --> 32:13.316
No, no. You should hear this.

32:13.318 --> 32:14.250
Woman to woman.

32:14.252 --> 32:17.253
Well, you know what?
I guess was thinking...

32:17.255 --> 32:18.555
I was thinking that...

32:18.557 --> 32:22.025
I don't actually think there's
anything going on between us.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.793
Oh, really?

32:23.795 --> 32:25.662
Was there something
going on between us

32:25.664 --> 32:28.400
when I was riding you
for 48 hours?

32:29.000 --> 32:29.966
Was there?

32:29.968 --> 32:31.668
Yeah, that's what I thought.

32:31.670 --> 32:32.903
I called you.

32:32.905 --> 32:34.637
I called you and I called you.

32:34.639 --> 32:36.306
I was worried.

32:36.308 --> 32:38.174
I thought he was dead.

32:38.176 --> 32:40.643
Is it me?
You said you liked my thighs.

32:40.645 --> 32:42.145
Did you hate my thighs?

32:42.147 --> 32:43.881
It was all in my head.

32:43.883 --> 32:47.650
But, no. Now I know
you're a fucking ghoster.

32:47.652 --> 32:50.923
Look, let me say this.
You're right.

32:51.556 --> 32:52.890
I'm sorry.

32:52.892 --> 32:57.460
I turned down a date with
Joaquin Phoenix for you.

32:57.462 --> 32:58.796
I should have called you.

32:58.798 --> 33:00.630
I apologize.
It's my fault.

33:00.632 --> 33:01.832
Whatever, dude.

33:01.834 --> 33:04.670
You're old.
You should know better.

33:05.270 --> 33:06.837
And now you know.

33:06.839 --> 33:09.675
When it's over,
he'll ghost you.

33:11.409 --> 33:13.779
- Listen, I...
- Such finality.

33:14.981 --> 33:16.816
You know who's not
a ghoster?

33:17.817 --> 33:19.284
Joaquin Phoenix.

33:20.452 --> 33:22.252
He's a good actor.

33:22.254 --> 33:23.890
- Wow.
- Hi.

33:24.590 --> 33:25.758
Joaquin?

33:26.324 --> 33:27.725
Yes. Ganja.

33:27.727 --> 33:28.792
You know, it's, um...

33:28.794 --> 33:30.159
It's not every day
you get to witness

33:30.161 --> 33:33.229
the beginning and the end
of a relationship in one night.

33:33.231 --> 33:36.099
Come on. Look, she wanted
to have a baby with me

33:36.101 --> 33:37.735
- on the second date.
- Mmm.

33:37.737 --> 33:39.570
Like make the child
that night.

33:39.572 --> 33:42.873
Was that before or after
you were all up in her thighs?

33:42.875 --> 33:44.975
- Well...
- Come on, man.

33:44.977 --> 33:46.977
This is the first night,
and I get this shit?

33:46.979 --> 33:49.413
Like, how many Ganjas
are there?

33:49.415 --> 33:51.017
Or did you ghost
your wife, too?

33:53.051 --> 33:54.117
Oh, shit.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.021
Shit!

33:55.488 --> 33:58.288
Nina. Look, Nina.

33:58.290 --> 34:01.961
Seriously. I know this is the type of
thing they warn you about on <i>Jezebel.</i>

34:02.628 --> 34:04.193
But I promise,

34:04.195 --> 34:06.966
I won't do this to you.
I promise.

34:08.501 --> 34:09.768
And if you do?

34:36.495 --> 34:41.465
<i>I go to work and I can
hear people talking about me.</i>

34:41.467 --> 34:44.268
<i>Talking about the smell.</i>

34:44.270 --> 34:46.536
<i>In the beginning they would
wonder where it came from,</i>

34:46.539 --> 34:49.639
<i>and couldn't possibly imagine
that it was a human smell.</i>

34:52.545 --> 34:54.880
<i>But it was me.
It was my smell.</i>

34:58.684 --> 34:59.683
Hello?

34:59.685 --> 35:01.318
Hey, Nina. It's Carrie.
Good news.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.354
You got the audition
for <i>Comedy Prime.</i>

35:03.356 --> 35:04.588
Really?

35:04.590 --> 35:05.823
I get to audition?

35:05.825 --> 35:07.092
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

35:07.094 --> 35:08.659
Yeah, you do.
But, listen.

35:08.661 --> 35:10.095
Don't be mad.

35:10.097 --> 35:11.428
<i>What?</i>

35:11.430 --> 35:13.297
They're changing things up
over at <i>Comedy Prime,</i>

35:13.299 --> 35:14.933
so it's not just you
that's auditioning.

35:14.935 --> 35:16.667
What do you mean?

35:16.669 --> 35:19.503
<i>There's gonna be a lot of other
comedians who are auditioning, too.</i>

35:19.505 --> 35:20.771
What, like a bake-off?

35:20.773 --> 35:23.440
Mmm-hmm. Exactly.
Like a female bake-off.

35:23.442 --> 35:25.242
Oh, like a fake-off.

35:25.244 --> 35:26.744
They know it's
a sausage fest over there,

35:26.746 --> 35:30.481
so they're gonna give one lucky
lady their own one hour special.

35:30.483 --> 35:33.417
That's great. I love being
judged on my gender.

35:33.419 --> 35:35.086
<i>Do we really wanna do that?
I mean...</i>

35:35.088 --> 35:36.721
Are they pitting us
against each other?

35:36.723 --> 35:37.822
That's not cool, right?

35:37.824 --> 35:39.924
Yeah, it's really gross.
And I don't care.

35:39.926 --> 35:41.026
Isn't this what
you've always wanted?

35:41.028 --> 35:42.660
I mean, I can give it
to someone else.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.662
<i>Three impersonations.
Got it?</i>

35:44.664 --> 35:46.330
You know,
I gotta go.

35:46.332 --> 35:47.901
<i>I'll talk to you later.
Goodbye.</i>

36:01.347 --> 36:03.048
Okay.

36:03.050 --> 36:04.783
This is Cher
talking to you right now,

36:04.785 --> 36:06.551
and I want you to know
that I believe in you.

36:06.553 --> 36:07.919
Is Cher southern?

36:07.921 --> 36:09.654
Am I turning Cher southern?

36:09.656 --> 36:11.823
I believe in you, Nina.
Oh, shit.

36:11.825 --> 36:15.128

37:15.355 --> 37:16.423
Hey, what's up?

37:17.424 --> 37:19.891
Hey, I'm starting to feel
like I'm getting into

37:19.893 --> 37:21.659
stalker territory,

37:21.661 --> 37:23.597
and I don't like that, so...

37:24.464 --> 37:27.166
I just didn't want you
to think that...

37:27.168 --> 37:30.502
that I ghosted my wife,
'cause I didn't.

37:30.504 --> 37:34.307
She actually, uh, left me
for one of my friends.

37:35.143 --> 37:36.841
Then I ghosted her.

37:36.843 --> 37:39.011
I mean, what else
could I do then?

37:39.013 --> 37:41.579
<i>Anyway, I know this is
a lot of information.</i>

37:41.581 --> 37:42.714
<i>I would love to see you.</i>

37:42.716 --> 37:44.582
<i>I want you to come by
if you would like to,</i>

37:44.584 --> 37:47.320
<i>and we can hang out
and I'll make you dinner.</i>

37:48.421 --> 37:51.125
<i>Hope things are well.
Talk soon.</i>

37:51.625 --> 37:52.626
<i>Bye bye.</i>

38:02.036 --> 38:04.569
- Hey.
- Can I help you?

38:04.571 --> 38:06.805
Oh, very funny.

38:06.807 --> 38:08.174
I was just kidding.
Just kidding.

38:08.176 --> 38:10.375
I brought this, 'cause I know
you like red wine, so...

38:10.377 --> 38:13.214
That's really nice of you.
Come on in.

38:14.282 --> 38:15.080
Welcome.

38:15.082 --> 38:16.514
So this is a nice house.

38:16.516 --> 38:18.117
It's not really what
I was expecting

38:18.119 --> 38:19.885
when you said you were
a contractor.

38:19.887 --> 38:22.687
I've been here for, like,
over 15 years.

38:22.689 --> 38:24.056
You were in the Marines?

38:24.058 --> 38:25.690
Semper Fi, baby.

38:25.692 --> 38:27.893
Don't worry.
I'm anti-war now.

38:27.895 --> 38:29.297
Oh, God. That's a relief.

38:32.066 --> 38:35.167
So, sobriety chip
and a full bar. Wow.

38:35.169 --> 38:37.837
I see I'm on
the hot seat already.

38:37.839 --> 38:40.572
Oh, yeah. You've been on the hot
seat ever since I found out

38:40.574 --> 38:45.110
you dated a Euro trash model half
your age whose name is weed.

38:45.112 --> 38:46.745
But you're still here.

38:46.747 --> 38:49.116
God, I must be more
fucked up than I realized.

38:49.416 --> 38:50.383
Cheers.

38:53.020 --> 38:54.587
So, this is what you do,
I guess, huh?

38:54.589 --> 38:58.226
You just charm women
into your beautiful lair.

39:00.695 --> 39:01.727
- Uh...
- Oh, yeah.

39:01.729 --> 39:03.562
Yeah, no. I can still
smell her pussy juice.

39:03.564 --> 39:05.264
Oh, my... Okay.

39:05.266 --> 39:06.799
Oh, come on.
Let's do it.

39:06.801 --> 39:09.602
Look, you know what? Have a seat.
Let's get at it, 'cause...

39:09.604 --> 39:10.669
What, already?

39:10.671 --> 39:13.608
Yeah. Well, I mean,
clearly it's bothering you.

39:14.976 --> 39:18.844
I mean, you said
we're not gonna fuck.

39:18.846 --> 39:22.181
So let's just get drunk,
talk it out,

39:22.183 --> 39:23.684
and have a good time.

39:24.585 --> 39:27.219
Wow. What a guy.
Okay.

39:27.221 --> 39:29.690
Okay, Ganja. You're always
talking about Ganja.

39:31.092 --> 39:32.491
First of all,
she's not a model.

39:32.493 --> 39:33.893
Oh, well,
that changes everything.

39:33.895 --> 39:35.561
She does have
amazing thighs.

39:35.563 --> 39:37.029
What the fuck?

39:37.031 --> 39:39.431
Not even those amazing thighs are
worth her blabbering fucking mouth.

39:39.433 --> 39:40.866
Do you like my thighs,

39:40.868 --> 39:42.134
or do you hate my thighs?

39:42.136 --> 39:44.304
I know I might
sound sexist.

39:44.306 --> 39:46.972
I'm not saying I want
my women pretty and quiet.

39:46.974 --> 39:47.973
You're here.

39:47.975 --> 39:49.708
- Wow.
- So...

39:49.710 --> 39:51.543
That didn't sound right.
Okay.

39:51.545 --> 39:52.713
You are amazing.

39:53.447 --> 39:55.215
You know it.

39:55.217 --> 39:57.386
But I'm just telling you
the truth about Ganja.

39:58.353 --> 40:00.552
I'm a 40-year-old man.

40:00.554 --> 40:03.123
I shouldn't be
with 20-year-olds.

40:03.125 --> 40:04.659
I know that.

40:05.726 --> 40:06.694
Now.

40:08.196 --> 40:09.730
What? What are you thinking?

40:11.099 --> 40:13.868
A big part of me
just wants to leave.

40:14.769 --> 40:16.369
Okay?

40:16.371 --> 40:18.271
But I also kind of
can't stop staring.

40:18.273 --> 40:19.505
Like a car crash.

40:19.507 --> 40:21.642
Yeah. Yeah, like a car crash.

40:23.278 --> 40:25.412
- Is it Ganja?
- No.

40:25.414 --> 40:27.314
I mean, this is great
and all, but,

40:27.316 --> 40:29.318
didn't you say you were
gonna make me dinner?

40:30.018 --> 40:31.184
Did I say make you dinner?

40:31.186 --> 40:33.188
- Yeah.
- Because I meant order.

40:33.854 --> 40:35.523
Yeah, I was impressed.

40:36.590 --> 40:37.991
Mmm... not so much.

40:37.993 --> 40:39.725
But I actually do cook.

40:39.727 --> 40:41.194
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:41.196 --> 40:43.163
I make flautas.

40:43.165 --> 40:45.031
Even more
insulting then, God.

40:45.033 --> 40:46.565
I mean, I would have
made flautas,

40:46.567 --> 40:48.068
but it would have
been too much.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.501
Really?

40:49.503 --> 40:51.603
Come on, I can't just make
you flautas the first time.

40:51.605 --> 40:54.107
Like, it's too much.
No woman can handle it.

40:54.109 --> 40:55.208
Not even you.

40:55.210 --> 40:57.279
Did you make flautas
for Ganja?

41:00.782 --> 41:01.716
Ugh!

41:02.284 --> 41:03.718
Unbelievable!

41:04.152 --> 41:05.684
I'm leaving.

41:05.686 --> 41:08.455
You keep being honest. What the
fuck is the matter with you?

41:08.457 --> 41:11.057
I think it's because I know
we're not gonna fuck tonight.

41:11.059 --> 41:12.461
It's liberating.

41:13.395 --> 41:15.095
Yeah, it is.
It is liberating.

41:15.097 --> 41:17.199
Yeah. Let's eat.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.501
Okay.

41:28.210 --> 41:29.510
What about you?

41:30.746 --> 41:32.914
Any Ganja equivalence
in your life?

41:44.760 --> 41:46.862
Hey, where'd you go?

41:49.865 --> 41:50.932
I, um...

41:56.171 --> 41:58.740
I don't usually date,
so I've never really...

42:00.976 --> 42:02.512
Never really
done this before.

42:04.546 --> 42:06.346
Never?

42:06.348 --> 42:09.951
I usually just fuck the
wrong guy and move on.

42:10.919 --> 42:11.920
How old are you?

42:13.356 --> 42:14.689
How old are you?

42:15.323 --> 42:16.792
I told you, I'm 40.

42:18.327 --> 42:20.228
Two. I'm 42.

42:21.029 --> 42:22.331
Okay. Well, I'm 30.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.801
Three. I'm 33.

42:26.668 --> 42:28.536
Jesus.

42:28.538 --> 42:30.506
And you never been
with anyone?

42:34.810 --> 42:37.010
How many... How many women
have you been with?

42:37.012 --> 42:38.546
No, no.
Let me guess.

42:38.548 --> 42:40.450
You probably lived
with a bunch of them.

42:40.782 --> 42:41.917
Three.

42:42.485 --> 42:44.050
Not at the same time.

42:44.052 --> 42:45.321
How was that?

42:45.654 --> 42:46.721
Great.

42:48.191 --> 42:49.624
Till it wasn't.

42:53.196 --> 42:55.697
Intimacy issues.
I get it.

42:56.932 --> 42:58.301
Daddy stuff?

43:02.438 --> 43:04.040
Yeah.

43:07.376 --> 43:09.778
Yeah, I told you
about mine.

43:11.214 --> 43:12.948
My dad left.

43:15.384 --> 43:16.986
Yeah, you said that.
Yeah.

43:19.388 --> 43:22.592
Mine, um...
Mine committed suicide.

43:25.027 --> 43:26.028
Damn.

43:29.165 --> 43:31.367
Suicide trumps abandonment.

43:32.435 --> 43:34.971
- Does it?
- Yeah, definitely.

43:39.375 --> 43:41.511
I don't know.
It's just, um...

43:42.711 --> 43:45.882
It's the relationship part
that I can't do.

43:48.818 --> 43:51.118
Makes me nervous.
I don't know what to do.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.520
So I just don't do it.

43:52.522 --> 43:54.824
Ah, you don't have to
do anything.

43:56.359 --> 43:58.327
Don't do nothing.

44:00.463 --> 44:02.932
Ah. I invited you in,

44:03.833 --> 44:06.000
and I said, "Welcome.

44:06.002 --> 44:07.201
Welcome, Nina."

44:07.203 --> 44:08.402
You did say that.

44:08.404 --> 44:10.204
Not that long ago.

44:10.206 --> 44:12.206
Why are you reminiscing?

44:12.208 --> 44:15.044
No, I know.
But that's a great time.

44:16.579 --> 44:17.614
Right?

44:18.347 --> 44:20.516
Any other things
you wanna share?

44:20.983 --> 44:22.617
Time's almost up.

44:22.619 --> 44:23.951
Is it?

44:23.953 --> 44:24.952
Wait, is that you?

44:24.954 --> 44:26.921
That wasn't even
supposed to be there.

44:26.923 --> 44:29.123
Oh. Oh, oh.

44:57.119 --> 44:58.620
Actually, I'm done entertaining.

44:58.622 --> 45:00.422
I'm done embarrassing myself.

45:00.424 --> 45:01.623
No, don't stop.
Come on. No.

45:01.625 --> 45:03.358
Come on.
I'm loving the band...

45:03.360 --> 45:04.959
I love it.
You're so old.

45:04.961 --> 45:07.395
At least I don't
smell old.

45:07.397 --> 45:11.433
It's true.
You smell young and fresh.

45:11.435 --> 45:12.866
So what...
What happened?

45:12.868 --> 45:14.835
What happened with that? The band?
I mean, that was amazing.

45:14.837 --> 45:16.770
Ah, the usual.

45:16.772 --> 45:20.342
We fought, and our drummer
died of a drug overdose.

45:20.344 --> 45:22.109
And then, the 90s ended.

45:22.111 --> 45:23.513
- Right.
- It was over.

45:24.548 --> 45:25.948
- I want it back.
- I know.

45:27.718 --> 45:29.453
Watch how quick I am.

45:30.220 --> 45:31.555
Well, I'm quicker.

45:32.189 --> 45:33.622
I fear a little fear in...

45:33.624 --> 45:35.592
- Mmm. No.
- Yeah.

45:37.461 --> 45:40.462
Ah!

45:40.464 --> 45:42.930
I think we're doing a great
job with not having sex.

45:42.932 --> 45:45.267
Yeah, I think we are.

45:45.269 --> 45:47.202
Is this when you
would usually...

45:47.204 --> 45:48.403
put the moves on?

45:48.405 --> 45:49.704
- Moves?
- Mm-hmm.

45:49.706 --> 45:52.107
What am I, a slow loris?

45:52.109 --> 45:53.807
It's been hours, Nina.

45:53.809 --> 45:56.046
I guess you don't
really know how it goes.

45:59.116 --> 46:01.583
We could have done it
like five times by now.

46:01.585 --> 46:03.851
- Five times? Wow.
- Wow.

46:03.853 --> 46:04.986
Hold on.

46:04.988 --> 46:06.755
I thought you were
the one that said

46:06.757 --> 46:09.493
you fuck guys like
you write home about.

46:10.727 --> 46:13.295
So, this can't be it,

46:13.297 --> 46:14.763
playing slapsies
at 3:00 A.M.

46:14.765 --> 46:16.598
That can't be your moves.

46:16.600 --> 46:18.266
'Cause it seems like
this is your move.

46:18.268 --> 46:19.634
Is this your move?

46:19.636 --> 46:21.636
- Slapsies.
- Yeah, slapsies.

46:21.638 --> 46:23.206
Freaking at 3:00 A.M.

46:24.941 --> 46:26.241
That turns you on?

46:26.243 --> 46:27.744
Slapsies, huh?

46:31.014 --> 46:32.347
No, no. Hold on.

46:32.349 --> 46:33.684
No, hold on.

46:35.285 --> 46:36.685
We can't do this.

46:36.687 --> 46:40.121
If we do this, I'll be just
another guy that you fucked

46:40.123 --> 46:41.690
and move on from.

46:41.692 --> 46:43.726
And that's not what
I want.

46:43.728 --> 46:45.797
I like you too much
for that.

46:46.697 --> 46:48.632
No one's ever
turned me down before.

46:58.275 --> 46:59.276
Let's go to your bedroom.

47:14.458 --> 47:17.194
Hey, don't fuck with me.

47:18.830 --> 47:20.097
I won't.

47:21.198 --> 47:22.265
Don't.

47:23.100 --> 47:24.234
Let me take care of you.

47:26.537 --> 47:27.971
Let me be your man.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.939
Rise and shine, sleepy head.

48:37.941 --> 48:40.776
I'm sorry to wake you,
but I have to go to work.

48:40.778 --> 48:43.379
And I don't want you to
think this is a hit and run.

48:43.381 --> 48:45.581
What...
What time is it?

48:45.583 --> 48:47.049
6:00.

48:47.051 --> 48:48.952
I have a meeting with
a client in Venice.

48:49.754 --> 48:51.120
Where'd you sleep?

48:51.122 --> 48:52.990
Right here in the bed
with you.

48:54.525 --> 48:56.227
- That's sweet.
- You snore.

48:57.061 --> 48:58.494
- I do?
- Yeah.

48:58.496 --> 48:59.695
Loud.

48:59.697 --> 49:01.664
Sounded like a dying buffalo.

49:01.666 --> 49:04.300
That's a beautiful sound.
Yeah.

49:04.302 --> 49:07.305
Well, I guess it's nice
for you, you were asleep.

49:10.408 --> 49:13.375
- You okay?
- Yeah.

49:13.377 --> 49:15.012
Yeah, I'm just hungover.

49:17.348 --> 49:20.017
All right. Well, I'll get
in touch with you later.

49:21.285 --> 49:22.919
Sandy, right?

49:22.921 --> 49:25.688
Wait, what's your
name again?

49:25.690 --> 49:27.656
I'm just playing.

49:27.658 --> 49:30.025
- I get it.
- Okay, okay.

49:30.027 --> 49:31.460
Well, here.
I brought you a shirt.

49:31.462 --> 49:32.831
You can stay
as long as you want.

49:34.165 --> 49:35.399
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

49:41.372 --> 49:43.140
There's snacks upstairs, too.

49:45.844 --> 49:47.378
I have some cereal here.

49:48.045 --> 49:49.781
And some fruit.

49:50.314 --> 49:51.750
All healthy shit.

50:23.982 --> 50:25.082
Breathe.

50:28.520 --> 50:31.287
<i>You've reached the
office of Dr. Joan Streisand.</i>

50:31.289 --> 50:33.823
<i>Please leave your message
and I will get back to you</i>

50:33.825 --> 50:35.825
- <i>as soon as I can.</i>
- That's...

50:35.827 --> 50:37.226
Dr. Streisand,
pick up the phone.

50:37.228 --> 50:38.728
Pick up the fucking phone,
please.

50:38.730 --> 50:40.363
Please pick up
the fucking...

50:40.365 --> 50:41.298
Please.

50:41.300 --> 50:43.433
Will you call me back?

50:43.435 --> 50:44.634
Call me back, okay?

50:44.636 --> 50:46.203
Okay, please call me.

50:50.207 --> 50:51.142
Okay.

50:52.578 --> 50:54.413
Okay, okay.

51:00.385 --> 51:01.818
Oh, no...

51:04.022 --> 51:05.322
I thought you
turned it off?

51:05.324 --> 51:06.556
I thought you did.

51:06.558 --> 51:09.259
It doesn't work unless we do
it for 15 minutes straight.

51:09.261 --> 51:11.093
- <i>I met somebody.</i>
- Okay.

51:11.095 --> 51:13.229
Who is he,
and what happened?

51:13.231 --> 51:15.398
I never had sex
like this before.

51:15.400 --> 51:16.835
I never. It was so...

51:18.203 --> 51:19.204
...intimate.

51:19.838 --> 51:22.872
He's funny and sexy, and...

51:22.874 --> 51:25.110
It's just the right
amount of screwed up.

51:26.745 --> 51:29.048
Oh, he fucks like a God.
Oh...

51:29.915 --> 51:31.114
Please.

51:31.116 --> 51:33.084
If I wasn't having
a panic attack right now,

51:33.086 --> 51:34.920
my pussy would
still be throbbing.

51:36.221 --> 51:38.688
<i>That all sounds
very nice.</i>

51:38.690 --> 51:41.291
<i>I mean, not every guy out
there knows how to do that.</i>

51:41.293 --> 51:42.592
Yeah.

51:42.594 --> 51:45.395
Yeah, I think I might be
really starting to like him.

51:45.397 --> 51:46.363
<i>That's great.</i>

51:46.365 --> 51:48.065
What if I fuck it up?

51:48.067 --> 51:49.801
Why will you do that?

51:51.503 --> 51:53.973
I'm trying really hard to
be honest with him.

51:55.273 --> 51:57.173
So it's scary.

51:57.175 --> 52:00.044
Honey, that's what
relationships are all about.

52:00.046 --> 52:01.012
Right?

52:01.014 --> 52:03.246
It's good that
you feel that way.

52:03.248 --> 52:06.083
That means that
you care about him.

52:06.085 --> 52:08.153
<i>You know what, Nina?
Why don't you come home?</i>

52:09.421 --> 52:10.923
I'm gonna cook Mexican.

52:19.531 --> 52:21.566
Shit. So goofy.

52:25.170 --> 52:27.272
Thank you for dinner, guys.
That was so good.

52:27.674 --> 52:29.406
Stuffed.

52:30.877 --> 52:33.245
Paula!

52:35.547 --> 52:37.948
How many times

52:37.950 --> 52:41.018
do I need to tell you
not to leave the sponge

52:41.020 --> 52:42.419
in the bottom of the sink?

52:42.421 --> 52:43.654
Yeah, I know.

52:43.656 --> 52:44.755
No, no.

52:44.757 --> 52:46.557
No "yeah, yeah" me, huh.

52:46.559 --> 52:48.561
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

52:52.732 --> 52:54.266
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

52:57.003 --> 52:59.235
I've asked you

52:59.237 --> 53:02.238
to leave the sponge
outside the sink

53:02.240 --> 53:05.076
so I don't need to move
all the dishes on top of it

53:05.078 --> 53:06.711
only to get to it.

53:06.713 --> 53:08.746
And when you ignore
a request of mine,

53:08.748 --> 53:09.882
I feel...

53:10.917 --> 53:12.248
...diminished.

53:12.250 --> 53:13.818
And rage.

53:13.820 --> 53:15.922
This right here is rage.

53:17.690 --> 53:19.390
I hear you.

53:19.392 --> 53:23.196
And I can understand why
you would feel that way.

53:24.097 --> 53:26.229
But I want you to understand

53:26.231 --> 53:29.734
that when I leave the sponge
at the bottom of the sink,

53:29.736 --> 53:31.035
and put plates
on top of it,

53:31.037 --> 53:34.004
I'm not doing it on purpose
just to piss you off.

53:34.006 --> 53:35.639
It's just what I do.

53:35.641 --> 53:38.077
I understand that.

53:39.912 --> 53:42.113
But that's exactly
what pisses me off.

53:42.115 --> 53:44.448
That you're not thinking
about me when you do that.

53:44.450 --> 53:48.387
Okay. Um, what if we got
one of those sponge holders?

53:49.856 --> 53:52.157
That way, maybe
if I could see it,

53:52.159 --> 53:54.226
it would help remind me

53:54.228 --> 53:57.029
to not put it
inside of the sink.

53:59.065 --> 54:02.266
That's actually a great idea.

54:02.268 --> 54:04.835
I mean, it's better than
having the sponge all around.

54:04.837 --> 54:06.270
I feel that way also,

54:06.272 --> 54:07.905
and I'm glad that we agree.

54:07.907 --> 54:09.907
Now, would you like
me to get it?

54:09.909 --> 54:11.475
Well, if you don't mind.

54:11.477 --> 54:12.979
I don't mind.

54:13.713 --> 54:15.314
- Okay.
- Okay.

54:16.916 --> 54:18.649
Thanks for listening.

54:18.651 --> 54:19.585
You're welcome.

54:21.621 --> 54:22.753
I love you, Pau.

54:22.755 --> 54:23.723
I love you.

54:29.963 --> 54:31.829
Yeah, we want our men
to be sensitive.

54:31.831 --> 54:33.697
To hold us when we cry.

54:33.699 --> 54:37.701
To tell us we look beautiful even
when we're waxing our mustache.

54:37.703 --> 54:40.604
Help us hide the body
of the dude we just shot.

54:41.808 --> 54:43.674
No, fuck him. he wouldn't
turn the Packers game off.

54:43.676 --> 54:45.344
Right, ladies? Ha!

54:46.213 --> 54:48.746
No, we want our men to cry.

54:48.748 --> 54:50.614
You know,
to have feelings.

54:50.616 --> 54:53.617
And then be able to
express those feelings.

54:53.619 --> 54:56.420
Most of them even
get to the first step.

54:56.422 --> 54:58.990
It's like,
"Talk to me, boo.

54:58.992 --> 55:01.226
Tell me what you're feeling."

55:01.228 --> 55:02.828
And then, if somebody comes
at us with a machete,

55:02.830 --> 55:05.730
we want our emotionally intelligent
man to just like fucking...

55:05.732 --> 55:07.567
Fuck! Don't you fucking move!

55:09.203 --> 55:11.770
And then just be like,
"I read your horoscope, babe."

55:11.772 --> 55:13.271
I see you.

55:13.273 --> 55:16.473
I'm your ally.
Mercury is in retrogade.

55:16.475 --> 55:19.811
It's our fucking time to get out
fucking fantasies out there.

55:19.813 --> 55:21.213
Right, ladies?
Who's with me?

55:21.215 --> 55:22.747
Who's with me?

55:22.749 --> 55:24.249
Are we asking for
too much?

55:24.251 --> 55:25.617
We're not asking
for too much.

55:25.619 --> 55:29.855
No. I want my men
strong and sensitive.

55:29.857 --> 55:31.258
Supportive.

55:32.159 --> 55:33.660
Machine washable.

55:34.761 --> 55:36.395
Steel enforced dick.

55:37.764 --> 55:39.199
Rechargeable.

55:39.867 --> 55:41.268
Refundable.

55:41.802 --> 55:43.101
And quiet.

55:43.103 --> 55:45.539
When I'm with my friends
talking shit about him.

55:57.050 --> 55:59.517
- Hey, Nina.
- Oh, Pam. Hey.

55:59.519 --> 56:01.052
Hey, you should come
to my club.

56:01.054 --> 56:03.021
- Oh, God. Yeah. Um...
- Awesome.

56:03.023 --> 56:04.990
I'd love to. Yeah.
What are you doing here?

56:04.992 --> 56:07.158
I am plucking the hairs
on my chiny-chin-chin.

56:07.160 --> 56:10.195
- Nice.
- They're blonde, but I know they're there.

56:10.197 --> 56:12.030
So no one can see them.

56:12.032 --> 56:14.367
I'm here filling in
for a friend.

56:14.369 --> 56:16.034
But do me a favor
and don't tell anyone.

56:16.036 --> 56:17.002
Okay.

56:17.004 --> 56:19.070
But you will come by.

56:19.072 --> 56:20.205
I will. I would love to.

56:20.207 --> 56:21.806
I mean, I'm gonna be
here a while. So...

56:21.808 --> 56:23.942
I know. <i>Comedy Prime.</i>

56:23.944 --> 56:25.076
How do you know
about that?

56:25.078 --> 56:27.012
It was on Chugfeed.

56:27.014 --> 56:28.546
What?

56:28.548 --> 56:31.451
It was like the top female comedians
that they're considering.

56:32.152 --> 56:34.586
And you are a female.

56:34.588 --> 56:35.587
I am, too.

56:35.589 --> 56:38.657
You know, isn't it great
like how all of a sudden

56:38.659 --> 56:40.259
- they know that we're funny?
- I know.

56:40.261 --> 56:42.228
The new species.
We've been discovered.

56:42.230 --> 56:44.731
Yeah. Like, my mom
was hilarious.

56:45.565 --> 56:46.731
And she's dead now.

56:46.733 --> 56:48.301
She's...

56:48.303 --> 56:49.868
- Oh, I don't know about that.
- Well...

56:49.870 --> 56:53.471
But did you know that I
tested for Comedy Prime?

56:53.473 --> 56:54.606
I didn't...
I didn't know.

56:54.608 --> 56:56.875
- I was really good.
- I'm sure you were.

56:56.877 --> 56:58.277
It was decades ago, though.

56:58.279 --> 56:59.878
- No...
- Yes.

56:59.880 --> 57:01.980
No, seriously.
It was decades ago.

57:01.982 --> 57:04.116
All those references
are worthless now.

57:04.118 --> 57:05.418
Where's the beef?

57:05.420 --> 57:08.689
I did a whole thing
about "where's the..."

57:09.756 --> 57:11.589
So, I don't know.

57:11.591 --> 57:13.025
I was...

57:13.027 --> 57:14.561
I was good. I was great.
I was good.

57:15.762 --> 57:18.630
There's all these women
that came before us.

57:18.632 --> 57:20.500
And it's your turn now.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.306
Yo!
You're Nina, right?

57:27.308 --> 57:29.008
- Yeah.
- I'm Dustin.

57:29.010 --> 57:30.109
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

57:30.111 --> 57:31.243
You're hilarious.
I just saw your set.

57:31.245 --> 57:32.677
- Thanks.
- Speaking of...

57:32.679 --> 57:34.514
I think I'm kind of
your perfect guy.

57:35.116 --> 57:36.748
Why do you say that?

57:36.750 --> 57:39.018
- Well, see that?
- Mm-hmm.

57:39.020 --> 57:40.786
- Bar fight.
- Oh.

57:40.788 --> 57:42.288
- Strong.
- Ouch.

57:42.290 --> 57:43.856
- See that?
- Yeah.

57:43.858 --> 57:45.291
Rescued a duck
in Echo Park.

57:45.293 --> 57:46.425
Oh, that is so sweet.

57:46.427 --> 57:47.762
- Sensitive, right?
- Yeah.

57:48.029 --> 57:49.197
Hmm.

58:02.443 --> 58:04.645
- Okay. Um...
- What's wrong?

58:06.280 --> 58:09.350
Sorry. I don't... I don't
think it's you. I, uh...

58:11.285 --> 58:12.787
I think it's just
somebody else.

58:15.056 --> 58:16.257
You wanna talk about it?

58:17.692 --> 58:19.227
That's very sweet.

58:20.094 --> 58:21.227
But, no.

58:21.229 --> 58:23.598
- I'm a good listener.
- I'm sure you are.

58:24.866 --> 58:25.867
Thank you.

58:26.868 --> 58:27.902
You sure?

58:38.179 --> 58:39.580
Hey.

58:40.848 --> 58:43.082
Why didn't you call me?

58:43.084 --> 58:44.719
I wanted to see
if you would call me.

58:45.787 --> 58:47.620
- Playing games?
- No.

58:47.622 --> 58:49.657
I just wanted to see
if you were into me.

58:51.359 --> 58:52.794
And if I hadn't called?

58:54.028 --> 58:55.431
I would have
called you.

58:56.365 --> 58:57.865
I was gonna call you.

59:02.203 --> 59:03.338
Come here.

59:09.744 --> 59:11.411
It's weird.

59:11.413 --> 59:14.516
You fuck so good, but you don't
have that sex addict vibe.

59:16.651 --> 59:21.656
Thanks. I mean, it sounds good.
I hope it's good.

59:24.226 --> 59:25.292
What are you doing?

59:25.294 --> 59:26.994
I'm writing down an idea.

59:28.062 --> 59:29.829
Let me hear it.

59:29.831 --> 59:33.533
Just like there should be an app that
tells you all your new guys' issues.

59:33.535 --> 59:35.202
- You know?
- Oh, great.

59:35.204 --> 59:38.438
Like, this one's a mama's boy,
or this asshole never tips,

59:38.440 --> 59:41.343
or this guy's into
toe fucking, or whatever.

59:42.277 --> 59:44.344
Who told you about
the toe fucking?

59:44.346 --> 59:45.911
Uh, your ex.

59:45.913 --> 59:47.746
Oh, come on.
Let it go.

59:47.748 --> 59:50.250
So what's the deal there? You
haven't seen her since you split?

59:50.252 --> 59:51.617
You're jealous already?

59:51.619 --> 59:54.956
Well, I have fucked you
twice now, so, yeah.

59:56.325 --> 59:58.427
I want to ask you about that.

59:59.261 --> 01:00:01.629
So you never saw anybody
more than once?

01:00:02.797 --> 01:00:03.798
Nope.

01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:07.503
No one?

01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:15.577
So how was work?

01:00:17.079 --> 01:00:18.947
Driving me fucking crazy.

01:00:20.015 --> 01:00:21.214
It's just all the waiting.

01:00:21.216 --> 01:00:23.617
Like, all I do now is just wait
for Larry Michaels to call,

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:26.386
or do stand-up,
or now fuck you.

01:00:26.388 --> 01:00:28.155
Who the fuck is Larry?

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:30.323
Oh, he runs <i>Comedy Prime.</i>

01:00:30.325 --> 01:00:32.727
I'm sorry. I like
the fucking you part.

01:00:33.762 --> 01:00:34.897
I bet you do.

01:00:41.403 --> 01:00:43.772
Read this.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.074
Give me a kiss.

01:00:51.513 --> 01:00:53.650
This is...
This dude is dumb.

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.484
Really.

01:00:56.318 --> 01:01:00.253
Actually, you're not
that smart.

01:01:00.255 --> 01:01:01.622
But, I mean,
what is he talking about,

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.089
he wouldn't take you home
to mama?

01:01:03.091 --> 01:01:04.357
I would take you
home to mama.

01:01:04.359 --> 01:01:06.495
Everybody would want to
take you home to mama.

01:01:07.062 --> 01:01:08.864
This guy, he's a goofy.

01:01:10.966 --> 01:01:12.100
It's my agent.

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:13.702
Hello?

01:01:14.736 --> 01:01:16.269
Really?

01:01:16.271 --> 01:01:18.774
Oh, fucking finally!
Where?

01:01:20.342 --> 01:01:22.008
Okay, thank you.

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.876
- Shit!
- What?

01:01:22.878 --> 01:01:24.311
I have to go.
I gotta get my stuff.

01:01:25.747 --> 01:01:28.281
Look, look, look. Hey, Nina,
you have time. It's okay.

01:01:28.283 --> 01:01:30.050
- Relax. Breathe.
- Okay.

01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:32.052
Just a quick
announcement before I go.

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:34.689
If you sat on any
of the stools in this pub,

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:37.257
you do now have HPV.
I hope that's cool.

01:01:37.259 --> 01:01:38.892
My name is Jamie Lactus.
Have a good night.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.468
Hey, what's up, guys?
Thank you for showing up.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:48.502
You guys all look beautiful...

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:50.304
Where is he, Larry?

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.339
I imagine
he's out there.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.006
Yeah, like fucking herpes.

01:01:53.008 --> 01:01:54.675
I gotta take a shit.

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:57.010
What's that smell?
Oh, Maria!

01:01:57.012 --> 01:01:58.379
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.716
You guys, uh,

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:01.982
seem nervous.

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.517
Oh, you look real cool.

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:04.918
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- Are you?

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.019
Actually, yes.

01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:07.921
All right. Real defensive.

01:02:07.923 --> 01:02:10.123
I wonder if we can tell the audience
that we're doing characters.

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:12.693
Otherwise they're gonna be
like super fucking confused.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:13.862
I know.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:17.734
Yolanda Oliver!

01:02:18.934 --> 01:02:20.468
What? No!

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.035
I'm supposed to be
like fourth.

01:02:22.037 --> 01:02:23.137
You go.

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:24.372
Yolanda, just go.

01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:25.439
Don't fuck it up.

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.007
Go, go.

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.342
I'm gonna fuck it up.

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.843
I'm gonna fuck it up.

01:02:29.845 --> 01:02:31.579
Unbelievable.
I'm gonna fuck it up now.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:38.187
This is Chelsea Handler
talking to a baby.

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:42.490
Oh, my God.
You're so cute.

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.425
I'd kiss you, but,
I'm afraid you have chlamydia

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:45.760
since you came out
of a vagina.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.261
What?

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:49.330
This is Bjork

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.399
trapped in an armoire.

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:53.134
Oh, fuck.

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:58.339
<i>♪ I've been stuck
inside Of here for so long ♪</i>

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:01.342
<i>♪ And I feel so good</i>

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:05.012
Ha ha ha ha.
Yes, it's me, Emma Stone.

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:07.248
I know what you're thinking.
"She's black."

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.282
Yes.

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:10.851
I'm black now.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:13.790
I really want that Best Picture Oscar.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:17.158
This next one is
Jabba the Slut.

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.067
Give me your dick.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.704
Hey, ladies.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:32.039
You ever, um, find yourself
at your guy's house

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:35.142
and you're like,
"Ah, I gotta take a shit."

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.846
But you try to hide it?

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.580
Hey, fellas.

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.916
You ever find yourself
at your lady's house

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:44.220
and you're like,
"Oh, I gotta take a shit."

01:03:45.756 --> 01:03:47.523
And so you're like...

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:51.793
And you just take
a damn shit.

01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:53.394
Why is she doing stand-up?

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:55.262
She's supposed to
do characters.

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:56.667
She has to take
a shit.

01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:04.775
Oh, fuck.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.281
Oh, no.

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:14.685
I'm not getting on stage next.

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.388
Hello.

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.691
Hello. I am Nina.

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:25.294
And this is Bijork
ordering a smoothie.

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:31.466
I would like the
memory of my first Christmas,

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:34.772
and also the underbelly
of a fairy,

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:38.774
with the sweat of
a newborn deer.

01:04:38.776 --> 01:04:43.911
And on top, millions and
millions of urban electrons.

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:47.284
Okay. Um, I'll take
Kristen Stewart's order.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:49.253
Um...

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:51.622
I'm sorry. What do people...

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:54.155
What do people order here?

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:56.591
I don't know.
I don't like being famous.

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:58.627
I don't like...

01:04:58.629 --> 01:04:59.761
I don't like being
like a celebrity.

01:04:59.763 --> 01:05:01.095
I don't like going out.
I just don't...

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:02.800
Could you not like look at me maybe?
I don't...

01:05:03.767 --> 01:05:06.066
Shelley Duvall
from <i>The Shining.</i>

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:08.603
Please!

01:05:08.605 --> 01:05:11.706
Just please take this
smoothie for me, please.

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:14.977
Okay. Is that Werner Herzog?

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:19.947
I would like
a neurotical smoothie

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:22.451
which is a representation

01:05:22.453 --> 01:05:25.823
of the deepest parts
of my soul.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.760
It should have
almond milk,

01:05:31.028 --> 01:05:32.162
chaos,

01:05:32.663 --> 01:05:34.097
fornication,

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:36.333
wheatgrass,

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:39.336
insanity,

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:41.238
coconips.

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:43.974
It should not have dairy.

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:47.609
It would be like
a serpent screaming

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:50.512
throughout my inner intestines.

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:54.282
<i>♪ Goji

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:58.220

01:06:02.927 --> 01:06:04.759

01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:06.328
Thank you.

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:09.966
It's okay.

01:06:09.968 --> 01:06:12.768
I'm sure they
didn't really notice.

01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:14.236
Did it get in your pussy?

01:06:14.238 --> 01:06:15.237
Yeah.

01:06:15.239 --> 01:06:16.638
Oh, girl!

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.406
You gotta see
a gynecologist.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:21.144
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:24.981
- Ugh!
- I'm sorry.

01:06:24.983 --> 01:06:27.215
Oh, my God. I can't believe
we both did Bjork.

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:28.450
Yeah.

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:30.051
Why don't you
drink that puke?

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.419
- No!
- Yeah.

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:32.724
Should I drink it?

01:06:38.195 --> 01:06:39.662
Why did you get a car?

01:06:39.664 --> 01:06:41.363
Does anybody walk?

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:43.098
No, it's LA.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.967
We don't walk.
Are you kidding?

01:06:44.969 --> 01:06:46.470
It's probably not that safe.

01:06:48.272 --> 01:06:50.806
Honeless people are
like crazier here.

01:06:50.808 --> 01:06:52.508
They are,
and I think it's because

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:54.913
they don't talk
to people often.

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:56.278
You know?

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.381
Hello?

01:07:01.753 --> 01:07:03.285
What? Really?

01:07:03.287 --> 01:07:05.253
Are you sure? 'Cause if I give
up my apartment in New York,

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:06.556
there is no going back.

01:07:06.558 --> 01:07:08.860
And I will come after you if
something goes wrong. I will.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.396
Thank you. Thanks.

01:07:22.907 --> 01:07:24.342
You got it?

01:07:24.909 --> 01:07:26.842
None of us got calls.

01:07:26.844 --> 01:07:29.380
Yeah, yeah.
I got it. I'm...

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.482
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:35.216
Oh, man!

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.519
Good job.

01:07:36.521 --> 01:07:39.120
I just wanna...
Just wanna...

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:41.524
throw you against
the wall and...

01:07:41.526 --> 01:07:43.259
I know.
I gotta go though.

01:07:43.261 --> 01:07:44.994
- Fuck you.
- Cool.

01:07:44.996 --> 01:07:47.964
I need to go and to be able
to support you as well.

01:07:47.966 --> 01:07:50.299
Yeah, I'm also...
I'm gonna leave.

01:07:50.301 --> 01:07:51.734
Fuck you.

01:07:51.736 --> 01:07:53.002
- No, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

01:07:53.004 --> 01:07:55.037
- Truly.
- Truly, fuck you.

01:07:55.039 --> 01:07:56.405
- Yeah.
- No, I'm so sorry.

01:07:56.407 --> 01:07:58.074
Truly, fuck you.

01:07:58.076 --> 01:07:59.976
I can't fucking believe it.

01:07:59.978 --> 01:08:02.178
Congrats.
A little clap for you.

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.847
I'm happy for you
on the inside.

01:08:04.849 --> 01:08:06.148
The outside looks tense...

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:09.018
- I sense it.
- But the inside is joyful.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.387
I just need to
have a cry.

01:08:11.389 --> 01:08:13.825
I'm gonna cry in
a bathtub.

01:08:20.465 --> 01:08:21.564
Hey.

01:08:21.566 --> 01:08:24.265
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- At the bar down the street.

01:08:24.268 --> 01:08:26.804
I figured you'd need a drink
one way or the other.

01:08:28.107 --> 01:08:30.473
You figured right.

01:08:30.475 --> 01:08:31.341
Well?

01:08:32.777 --> 01:08:35.078
I...

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.578
- ...got it.
- You got it?

01:08:36.581 --> 01:08:38.216
- I got it.
- What?

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:41.684
Larry Michaels wants
to meet me,

01:08:41.685 --> 01:08:43.653
but I got it,
I fucking got it.

01:08:43.654 --> 01:08:44.957
I fucking got it!

01:08:48.027 --> 01:08:50.027
Welcome to the rest
of your life.

01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:51.995
She's gonna be on
<i>Comedy Prime!</i>

01:08:51.997 --> 01:08:53.997
She's on <i>Comedy Prime.</i>
I gotta watch the show.

01:08:53.999 --> 01:08:55.966
Yes, you do.
Of course you have to watch.

01:08:55.968 --> 01:08:57.433
Can we get fucked up now?

01:08:57.435 --> 01:08:58.667
We got drinks right here.

01:08:58.670 --> 01:08:59.903
- Oh, it's perfect.
- Come on.

01:08:59.904 --> 01:09:01.040
We ready?

01:09:26.098 --> 01:09:29.166
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Watch it, bitch.

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:31.033
Don't call me
a bitch, you bitch.

01:09:31.036 --> 01:09:32.536
You touch me again,
you fucking midget...

01:09:32.537 --> 01:09:33.603
What the fuck
is your problem?

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:34.770
Get the fuck
off my daughter!

01:09:34.773 --> 01:09:36.008
I got her.

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:39.910
Wanna try again?
Wanna try again?

01:09:39.912 --> 01:09:41.410
Come on. What? What?

01:09:41.412 --> 01:09:42.313
Try again.

01:09:45.084 --> 01:09:46.384
I gotta get
my fucking jacket.

01:09:57.563 --> 01:09:58.895
So, what was that?

01:09:58.897 --> 01:10:00.697
What was what?
Did you not...

01:10:00.699 --> 01:10:03.100
She fucking bumped into me.
Did you not see that?

01:10:03.102 --> 01:10:05.234
But it was by mistake.
It happens.

01:10:05.236 --> 01:10:07.003
You can't just
start a fight

01:10:07.005 --> 01:10:10.040
and just get up in the face of everybody
who accidentally bumps into you.

01:10:10.042 --> 01:10:11.610
Hell of a dad though, right?

01:10:12.811 --> 01:10:14.580
Wish you'd defended me
like that.

01:10:15.514 --> 01:10:17.280
Defend you from what?

01:10:17.282 --> 01:10:19.282
You started a fight with her
for no reason.

01:10:19.284 --> 01:10:22.018
What, am I not ladylike enough
for you now? Is that it?

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.987
You know what?
I think you're drunk.

01:10:23.989 --> 01:10:25.088
No, I'm not drunk.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:26.959
- You've been drinking too much.
- I'm not.

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.628
What, you're just being
an asshole?

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.235
What?

01:10:36.702 --> 01:10:38.169
What is it?
I mean...

01:10:38.171 --> 01:10:40.403
It must be nice, huh?

01:10:40.405 --> 01:10:42.773
To look down from
your ivory tower.

01:10:42.775 --> 01:10:44.276
What are you
talking about?

01:10:44.877 --> 01:10:46.710
I'm Rafe.

01:10:46.712 --> 01:10:49.579
I like nice things.

01:10:49.581 --> 01:10:51.182
I make things with my hands.

01:10:51.184 --> 01:10:52.783
I'm a California native.

01:10:52.785 --> 01:10:54.017
I'm special.

01:10:54.019 --> 01:10:55.088
I'm Rafe.

01:10:55.721 --> 01:10:56.953
I'm Rafe.

01:11:00.026 --> 01:11:01.892
What? What now?
Cat got your tongue?

01:11:01.894 --> 01:11:03.660
'Cause I can just
keep going, you know.

01:11:03.662 --> 01:11:07.898
You know, let's take...
I'm gonna take you home.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.967
What, you wanna
fuck through this?

01:11:09.969 --> 01:11:12.170
- No. Come on.
- The conflict, you know?

01:11:12.172 --> 01:11:13.904
- No. Come on.
- 'Cause we can.

01:11:13.906 --> 01:11:16.640
I know you...
You might like that.

01:11:16.642 --> 01:11:17.743
I don't know.

01:11:29.721 --> 01:11:31.057
Bye.

01:11:37.362 --> 01:11:38.363
Lake.

01:11:41.633 --> 01:11:42.634
Lake.

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:45.937
What are you doing?

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.144
Stream, ocean, brook!

01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:53.713
Hello.

01:11:54.413 --> 01:11:55.414
Lake.

01:11:56.783 --> 01:11:58.084
Lake, Lake, Lake.

01:11:59.585 --> 01:12:00.720
What the fuck, Nina?

01:12:01.788 --> 01:12:03.587
I was trance writing.

01:12:03.589 --> 01:12:07.293
I don't have time for
your bullshit right now, okay?

01:12:07.961 --> 01:12:09.060
Okay, what's going on?

01:12:09.062 --> 01:12:10.763
How do you... How...

01:12:11.931 --> 01:12:13.333
Oh, God.

01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:17.034
How does...
When he...

01:12:17.036 --> 01:12:18.903
How... What do you...

01:12:18.905 --> 01:12:20.204
Put your shit together.
Okay?

01:12:20.206 --> 01:12:22.039
I can't. I can't.

01:12:22.041 --> 01:12:23.941
You poor thing.

01:12:23.943 --> 01:12:25.712
You're in such distress.

01:12:26.179 --> 01:12:28.114
Nina, the truth

01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:30.014
will set you free.

01:12:30.016 --> 01:12:32.185
What if the truth
sends you to jail?

01:12:32.652 --> 01:12:33.851
What?

01:12:33.853 --> 01:12:35.086
Oh, my God.

01:12:35.088 --> 01:12:36.988
Nina, did you commit
a crime?

01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:39.924
No, I didn't...
Stop. I can't...

01:12:39.926 --> 01:12:41.926
Look, the truth will
set you free.

01:12:41.928 --> 01:12:44.395
People say that,
but that's...

01:12:44.397 --> 01:12:46.831
John said that to the Jews,
and look where it got us.

01:12:46.833 --> 01:12:50.134
I have no idea what we're
talking about anymore.

01:12:50.136 --> 01:12:53.905
All I can tell you
is that Rafe is a solid dude.

01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:57.577
You just have to tell him whatever
the fuck is bothering you.

01:12:58.912 --> 01:13:00.480
Woman the fuck up, Nina.

01:13:01.047 --> 01:13:02.448
Tell the truth.

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:05.386
The truth, here.

01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:45.558
Hi.

01:13:48.461 --> 01:13:49.396
How are you?

01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:52.064
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:13:52.066 --> 01:13:53.531
I'm sorry.

01:13:53.533 --> 01:13:55.700
I didn't mean any of the
things I said about you.

01:13:55.702 --> 01:13:57.202
You know that, right?

01:13:57.204 --> 01:14:00.504
Well, actually, everything
you said was really true.

01:14:00.506 --> 01:14:02.840
But it seems you don't like
that I'm that way.

01:14:02.842 --> 01:14:05.010
I do. I...

01:14:05.012 --> 01:14:07.480
I really like
everything about you.

01:14:09.049 --> 01:14:10.648
I just... I don't know
why I did that.

01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:11.782
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:14:11.784 --> 01:14:14.721
Let's talk about it later.
You have a show.

01:14:15.923 --> 01:14:17.391
I didn't think
you'd come.

01:14:18.691 --> 01:14:19.858
You invited me.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.296
Yeah, I know. But I didn't
think you'd show now.

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:24.697
Thank you.

01:14:26.066 --> 01:14:27.901
God, you're so
fucking solid.

01:14:28.969 --> 01:14:30.337
I'm special.

01:14:32.906 --> 01:14:34.274
I'm Rafe.

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:37.075
- I'm special.
- Ugh!

01:14:37.077 --> 01:14:38.345
I'm Rafe.

01:14:39.079 --> 01:14:40.511
I'm special.

01:14:47.955 --> 01:14:49.356
Oh, hey.
What up, Nina?

01:14:51.859 --> 01:14:53.158
- Hey, I'm Joe.
- What's up, man?

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.493
- Yeah.
- I'm Rafe.

01:14:54.495 --> 01:14:56.028
You guys look good. She looks good.
How are you?

01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:58.897
What... What are you
doing here?

01:14:58.899 --> 01:15:01.433
I would have told you I was coming,
but you fucking blocked me.

01:15:01.435 --> 01:15:02.968
I saw your post.
I thought you were funny.

01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:04.202
She's really funny,
isn't she?

01:15:04.204 --> 01:15:05.570
Fucking hilarious.

01:15:05.572 --> 01:15:08.407
Don't leave, don't leave.
No, no, no. Nina.

01:15:08.409 --> 01:15:10.842
He's not a good guy.
He's a cop. Hey...

01:15:10.844 --> 01:15:11.743
I left her.

01:15:11.745 --> 01:15:13.779
I left her, Nina.
I left her for you.

01:15:13.781 --> 01:15:14.780
Don't fucking touch me.

01:15:14.782 --> 01:15:16.281
I left her just like I...
Nina, look at me.

01:15:16.283 --> 01:15:19.286
Will you do something?
Will you fucking protect me?

01:15:22.890 --> 01:15:24.389
Ah, fuck!

01:15:24.391 --> 01:15:25.993
Get the fuck off me.

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:30.664
Yeah, you can have her,
you fucking bitch.

01:15:34.768 --> 01:15:35.936
Fuck!

01:15:38.839 --> 01:15:40.238
Rafe...

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.274
Oh, so this is what you want? You
want us fighting over you now?

01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:44.776
You want men
fighting over you now?

01:15:44.778 --> 01:15:46.312
So he's married?

01:15:46.314 --> 01:15:47.981
But he just left
his wife for you?

01:15:48.949 --> 01:15:50.918
That's so nice. Wow!

01:15:51.752 --> 01:15:53.819
A married cop?

01:15:53.821 --> 01:15:55.457
That's great, Nina.

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:57.925
Does he have kids?

01:15:59.693 --> 01:16:01.927
You know what?
Don't tell me.

01:16:01.929 --> 01:16:05.163
I bet he chokes black people
for fun, too, huh?

01:16:05.165 --> 01:16:06.800
- It's over.
- It is?

01:16:07.335 --> 01:16:08.534
He's here.

01:16:08.536 --> 01:16:10.470
He left his wife
for you.

01:16:10.472 --> 01:16:12.639
You said you didn't
have relationships.

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:17.909
No snappy comeback now?
What?

01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:19.811
What, you're just gonna
go on stage and act like

01:16:19.813 --> 01:16:21.347
you're the strong,
independent woman

01:16:21.349 --> 01:16:22.950
that always gets
what she wants?

01:16:24.152 --> 01:16:25.553
The fuck out of here.

01:16:48.009 --> 01:16:49.275
Nina?

01:16:49.277 --> 01:16:52.078
Nina?
Nina Geld?

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.946
Oh, my gosh!
It's Amy.

01:16:53.948 --> 01:16:56.916
- Amy. I am your mother's best friend and neighbor.
- Oh, God. Yeah.

01:16:56.918 --> 01:16:59.818
- Yeah. Hi.
- Oh, I'm here visiting my parents.

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:02.054
I saw that you were
acting here,

01:17:02.056 --> 01:17:05.726
so I thought, why don't I just
go see what Deb's kid does.

01:17:06.861 --> 01:17:09.262
So, um...
You okay?

01:17:09.264 --> 01:17:10.229
Yeah.

01:17:10.231 --> 01:17:11.564
Well, the reason why I ask is,

01:17:11.566 --> 01:17:14.934
'cause, to be honest
with you, I've, um...

01:17:14.936 --> 01:17:17.136
seen some of the clips

01:17:17.138 --> 01:17:19.607
that you've been putting
on the Internet.

01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:22.808
There's so much
anger in you.

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:24.243
I don't know why.

01:17:24.245 --> 01:17:26.279
I mean, life is beautiful.

01:17:26.281 --> 01:17:27.580
Don't you know that?

01:17:27.582 --> 01:17:29.949
Yeah, it's not beautiful
for everybody, Amy.

01:17:29.951 --> 01:17:31.119
It's just not.

01:17:35.323 --> 01:17:36.556
Nina!

01:17:36.558 --> 01:17:39.392
Congratulations
on the job, girl!

01:17:39.394 --> 01:17:42.028
Is it just me, or are there more
people here tonight than usual?

01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:43.329
Oh, yeah, yeah.
There are.

01:17:43.331 --> 01:17:44.430
Word gets around fast.

01:17:44.432 --> 01:17:46.299
Plus, I sent out
a mass email.

01:17:46.301 --> 01:17:48.201
'Cause this is great for me.
I need this.

01:17:48.203 --> 01:17:51.370
You know,
you're a name now.

01:17:51.372 --> 01:17:54.042
All these people
are here to see you.

01:17:54.610 --> 01:17:55.576
Okay?

01:17:55.578 --> 01:17:57.678
So, it's no pressure,
but there really is.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.413
Kind of a lot of pressure
on you to do great.

01:18:00.415 --> 01:18:01.548
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:02.583
You guys ready
for our next act?

01:18:02.585 --> 01:18:05.151
Give it up real big
for Nina Geld.

01:18:14.463 --> 01:18:15.728
Hello.

01:18:15.730 --> 01:18:17.397
Hello. Wow.

01:18:17.399 --> 01:18:18.567
That's a lot of...

01:18:20.569 --> 01:18:23.470
Lot of people here
tonight. Um...

01:18:23.472 --> 01:18:26.573
More than usual.
I'm a little bit...

01:18:26.575 --> 01:18:28.609
I think I'm a little
nervous here.

01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:30.344
I had to build
my confidence up.

01:18:30.346 --> 01:18:32.379
You know, I wish I had
the confidence of, like,

01:18:32.381 --> 01:18:35.282
any guy walking into
a guitar center.

01:18:35.284 --> 01:18:37.551
Just like any guy.

01:18:37.553 --> 01:18:40.922
Just the pure,
unearned self-assurance

01:18:41.323 --> 01:18:42.755
that you feel.

01:18:42.757 --> 01:18:45.425
You know, I was gonna do...
I had a whole bit about, like

01:18:45.427 --> 01:18:48.761
periods and shitting liquid,
and all this stuff.

01:18:48.763 --> 01:18:51.163
But there's something
that just been bothering me,

01:18:51.165 --> 01:18:52.568
and I think I'm gonna...

01:18:53.736 --> 01:18:56.672
Um, I'm trying to be more
truthful in my life. So...

01:19:04.413 --> 01:19:06.513
Oh. Thanks. Thank you.

01:19:06.515 --> 01:19:10.217
So, what's that they say? They say the
truth will set you free, right? Yeah?

01:19:10.219 --> 01:19:11.886
So I'm just gonna...

01:19:13.788 --> 01:19:15.389
I'm just gonna
share it with you.

01:19:15.391 --> 01:19:17.957
Hope...
Hope for that.

01:19:17.959 --> 01:19:21.261
I've been reading a lot
of stuff about myself recently.

01:19:21.263 --> 01:19:23.065
People seem to think
I'm negative.

01:19:24.266 --> 01:19:26.602
Yeah, I know.
Negative. Huh!

01:19:27.869 --> 01:19:29.071
Polarizing.

01:19:29.705 --> 01:19:30.872
Angry.

01:19:31.906 --> 01:19:34.476
Not the type of girl
you'd want to bring home.

01:19:35.144 --> 01:19:36.512
Hmm.

01:19:36.979 --> 01:19:37.911
Well, guess what.

01:19:37.913 --> 01:19:40.649
I don't wanna fucking
go home with you.

01:19:40.983 --> 01:19:42.151
Okay?

01:19:45.587 --> 01:19:47.954
I recently ran into
this woman

01:19:47.956 --> 01:19:50.390
who, um, I lived next door
to since I was a kid.

01:19:50.392 --> 01:19:53.929
She was like, "Nina...

01:19:54.663 --> 01:19:56.730
Why are you so angry?

01:19:56.732 --> 01:20:00.636
I follow you on the computer
and it's really sad."

01:20:02.104 --> 01:20:03.539
First of all,

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.406
fuck you, Amy.

01:20:06.408 --> 01:20:08.675
Fuck you.
Why are you following me?

01:20:08.677 --> 01:20:10.043
You love Nicholas Sparks.

01:20:10.045 --> 01:20:12.946
You have no business
reading my shit, you cunt.

01:20:12.948 --> 01:20:15.683
And just because
I grew up next door to you,

01:20:15.685 --> 01:20:17.884
and I smiled every time
you recapped <i>Days of our Lives</i>

01:20:17.886 --> 01:20:20.889
doesn't mean you're gonna like
my social media posts now, okay?

01:20:21.758 --> 01:20:23.490
And also, I find it
pretty amusing

01:20:23.492 --> 01:20:24.759
when people tell me
to cheer up.

01:20:24.761 --> 01:20:26.159
Because considering
the shit I've been through,

01:20:26.161 --> 01:20:27.896
I'm pretty fucking cheery.

01:20:29.231 --> 01:20:32.432
People are like,
"Oh, you're such a man-hater.

01:20:32.434 --> 01:20:34.771
God, you're always picking
on men." Yeah.

01:20:38.608 --> 01:20:40.844
Oh, you haven't
seen anything yet.

01:20:46.215 --> 01:20:49.318
You try being raped by your
own father for eight years.

01:20:59.529 --> 01:21:01.831
See what that does
for your opinion of men.

01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:09.271
Yeah.

01:21:11.306 --> 01:21:13.374
Eight years of rape
will, um,

01:21:13.376 --> 01:21:15.310
make anybody
a little irritated.

01:21:16.646 --> 01:21:19.181
Not just in your vagina,
but in your head, too.

01:21:21.917 --> 01:21:23.551
The thing fucking
Amy doesn't get

01:21:23.553 --> 01:21:25.553
is she's lucky I don't
turn into the Hulk

01:21:25.555 --> 01:21:27.657
every time somebody
says hello to me.

01:21:30.293 --> 01:21:31.759
When a guy
asks for my number,

01:21:31.761 --> 01:21:34.562
my immediate instinct is to break a
fucking beer bottle over his head.

01:21:37.667 --> 01:21:39.269
It takes years

01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:44.641
of recovery and therapy,
and...

01:21:46.242 --> 01:21:47.610
...frankly drinking,

01:21:48.645 --> 01:21:51.646
not to just
punch some dude out

01:21:51.648 --> 01:21:53.648
who just wanted directions.

01:21:53.650 --> 01:21:55.652
Oh, sorry, sir.
You said...

01:21:57.153 --> 01:21:58.386
"Where is Venice Beach?"

01:21:58.388 --> 01:22:00.356
I could have sworn you said,
"Where is your vagina, bitch?"

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:06.227
I remember this party I went to
in college where...

01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:07.961
they were playing
stupid truth or dare games.

01:22:07.963 --> 01:22:10.498
The hostess is like,
"How did you...

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.368
How did you lose
your virginity?"

01:22:15.505 --> 01:22:17.240
None of your
fucking business.

01:22:18.808 --> 01:22:22.009
You know, only virgins
ask this shit.

01:22:22.011 --> 01:22:24.745
Or people who lived in a bubble
of protection their entire lives.

01:22:24.747 --> 01:22:26.716
And yes, I am
jealous of them.

01:22:29.252 --> 01:22:31.988
I'm jealous of their mothers
who come out to visit them.

01:22:36.993 --> 01:22:39.095
What I wanted to say
was what happened.

01:22:43.968 --> 01:22:45.803
How did I lose
my virginity?

01:22:50.273 --> 01:22:52.073
Face down on the floor,

01:22:52.075 --> 01:22:55.211
when I was 12, eyes on my cat,
while my father raped me.

01:22:59.015 --> 01:23:01.215
Yeah, I know. It's not
great party conversation,

01:23:01.217 --> 01:23:02.452
but you fucking asked.

01:23:07.123 --> 01:23:09.092
But instead I made up
a story about

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.830
losing my virginity
to a boy I used to love.

01:23:16.165 --> 01:23:17.935
'Cause that's what
I would have liked.

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:23.572
So, yeah, all in all, I think I'm
doing pretty well, you know.

01:23:23.574 --> 01:23:25.774
I do what I love.

01:23:25.776 --> 01:23:27.443
I'm a reasonably
good person.

01:23:31.949 --> 01:23:33.782
I might even be able to
love somebody some day

01:23:33.784 --> 01:23:35.351
the way that
they deserve it.

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:42.724
Yeah, catch you next time.

01:23:42.726 --> 01:23:44.227
Thanks for coming.

01:24:51.695 --> 01:24:53.564
<i>This is Rafe.
Leave a message.</i>

01:25:15.086 --> 01:25:18.153
I hadn't thought
about him in so long.

01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:20.155
Van Halen one.
You were right.

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:21.757
Hey, Bree.
How you doing?

01:25:21.759 --> 01:25:24.259
Mike! Mike, Mike, Mike!

01:25:24.261 --> 01:25:26.029
Look what the cat
dragged in.

01:25:26.031 --> 01:25:28.165
You, uh, seemed
a little...

01:25:28.799 --> 01:25:29.999
It's really a hug there.

01:25:30.001 --> 01:25:32.001
- Oh, I missed you.
- Missed me?

01:25:32.003 --> 01:25:34.636
I heard you sort of had
a bit of a meltdown tonight.

01:25:34.638 --> 01:25:37.639
Like really kooky. Talking about
fucking your dad or something?

01:25:37.641 --> 01:25:40.676
Is that your <i>Tonight Show</i>
set you're working out?

01:25:40.678 --> 01:25:42.479
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:44.115 --> 01:25:45.549
You gotta take
some chances.

01:25:48.119 --> 01:25:50.187
Slap a guy in the face
and laugh.

01:26:00.999 --> 01:26:02.999
- Let me kiss you.
- Shut up.

01:26:03.001 --> 01:26:05.003
I love you.
I love you.

01:26:06.938 --> 01:26:08.738
- Nina, I'm ready to come.
- Good.

01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.773
Oh, fuck!

01:26:10.775 --> 01:26:13.277
Oh, fuck, yes! Oh!

01:26:13.578 --> 01:26:14.646
Oh!

01:26:36.868 --> 01:26:38.470
<i>How did you
lose your virginity?</i>

01:26:40.337 --> 01:26:41.804
<i>None of your
fucking business.</i>

01:26:41.806 --> 01:26:43.141
Shit.

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:45.610
<i>How did I lose
my virginity?</i>

01:26:46.745 --> 01:26:48.511
<i>Face down on the floor,</i>

01:26:48.513 --> 01:26:52.682
<i>when I was 12, eyes on my cat,
while my father raped me.</i>

01:26:52.684 --> 01:26:55.017
<i>Yeah, I know. It's not
great party conversation,</i>

01:26:55.019 --> 01:26:56.621
<i>but you fucking asked.</i>

01:27:00.358 --> 01:27:01.459
Hi, Mom.

01:27:56.215 --> 01:27:58.381
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Nina. Oh, my God.

01:27:58.383 --> 01:28:00.817
<i>Are you okay? I've been
trying you all morning.</i>

01:28:00.819 --> 01:28:02.154
Yeah, um...

01:28:02.787 --> 01:28:03.921
Crazy night.

01:28:03.923 --> 01:28:08.424
Yeah. I'm so sorry, honey.
I had no idea.

01:28:08.426 --> 01:28:10.294
<i>Thanks, Carrie.</i>

01:28:10.296 --> 01:28:13.462
Is everything okay? Did I get
fired from <i>Comedy Prime?</i>

01:28:13.464 --> 01:28:14.697
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

01:28:14.699 --> 01:28:16.233
Hopefully
everything will be fine.

01:28:16.235 --> 01:28:17.633
What do you mean
"hopefully"?

01:28:17.635 --> 01:28:20.971
<i>Well, you're trending now, Nina.
It's a great thing.</i>

01:28:20.973 --> 01:28:22.471
But you need
a publicist.

01:28:22.473 --> 01:28:23.706
Why?

01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:25.809
<i>Because now you're
the comedian who was raped,</i>

01:28:25.811 --> 01:28:27.410
<i>and that is not
gonna go away.</i>

01:28:27.412 --> 01:28:28.946
I"ll put you in touch
with Bunny.

01:28:28.948 --> 01:28:30.147
- Bunny?
- Bunny.

01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:32.117
She's the best, and she
was also a rape victim.

01:28:32.483 --> 01:28:33.518
Survivor.

01:28:34.419 --> 01:28:36.186
And you shouldn't
out her, Carrie.

01:28:36.188 --> 01:28:38.521
Okay. Well,
Bunny will call you.

01:28:38.523 --> 01:28:41.158
<i>And now I have to
go handle your career.</i>

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.394
Ooh. By the way,
do you wanna do an <i>SVU?</i>

01:28:43.628 --> 01:28:44.630
No.

01:29:20.933 --> 01:29:22.801
Say the word and
I'll kick him out, Nina.

01:29:24.103 --> 01:29:26.036
Just... I'm here for you.

01:29:26.038 --> 01:29:28.605
Hmm. Yeah. Thank you.

01:29:28.607 --> 01:29:29.840
- Okay.
- It's okay.

01:29:29.842 --> 01:29:30.743
Mmm-hmm.

01:29:47.493 --> 01:29:48.761
I'm sorry.

01:29:51.063 --> 01:29:52.464
I'm sorry I left.

01:29:57.603 --> 01:29:58.837
It won't happen anymore.

01:30:03.475 --> 01:30:05.544
I believe despite everything,

01:30:06.578 --> 01:30:08.148
we're good together.

01:30:33.772 --> 01:30:35.908
No, I don't know.

01:31:26.459 --> 01:31:28.560
I got you, I got you.

01:31:29.496 --> 01:31:31.264
Does the cat
make you feel better?

01:31:31.865 --> 01:31:32.799
Yeah.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.134
I love you.

01:31:36.136 --> 01:31:37.904
You know,
it is really nice here.

01:31:39.139 --> 01:31:40.304
It is really nice.

01:31:40.306 --> 01:31:42.306
Yeah, it's all right.

01:31:42.308 --> 01:31:44.944
So, house cats.
I thought they'd be bigger.

01:32:02.729 --> 01:32:03.930
You're very funny, Nina.

01:32:05.632 --> 01:32:07.468
Oh. Hi. Um...

01:32:09.503 --> 01:32:11.602
So nice to meet you. Thank so
much for this opportunity.

01:32:11.604 --> 01:32:13.004
We're in here.

01:32:13.006 --> 01:32:14.007
Okay.

01:32:17.777 --> 01:32:20.512
Now, I usually like to ask
people I'm interested in hiring

01:32:20.514 --> 01:32:22.248
about their childhood.

01:32:23.417 --> 01:32:26.084
What did their parents do.
That type of thing.

01:32:26.086 --> 01:32:28.322
Eases most people
into conversation.

01:32:29.722 --> 01:32:32.324
Considering your performance
on Friday,

01:32:32.326 --> 01:32:36.328
that seems
a bit perfunctory.

01:32:36.330 --> 01:32:38.566
I'm happy to tell you
about my parents, sir.

01:32:39.199 --> 01:32:40.698
Oh, call me Larry, please.

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:43.134
I already feel old enough
as it is.

01:32:43.136 --> 01:32:44.804
Larry. Okay.

01:32:45.705 --> 01:32:47.974
We're in a funny place
right now.

01:32:49.376 --> 01:32:51.310
People think
they want reality,

01:32:51.312 --> 01:32:54.213
but they really want
a curated reality.

01:32:54.215 --> 01:32:56.950
A bit of performance,
a bit of hope.

01:32:59.052 --> 01:33:01.752
You're a very
strong performer.

01:33:01.754 --> 01:33:05.559
I know you can do wonderful
things here at Comedy Prime.

01:33:06.093 --> 01:33:08.828
But you've also come out

01:33:10.097 --> 01:33:12.297
with this very
powerful voice

01:33:12.299 --> 01:33:13.631
against abuse.

01:33:13.633 --> 01:33:17.035
And I'm wondering if that's
all people are gonna see

01:33:17.037 --> 01:33:18.405
when they see you.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.673
What do you think?

01:33:24.512 --> 01:33:28.983
I think if that information prevents
people from enjoying me play Taylor Swift,

01:33:29.782 --> 01:33:31.018
then that's on them.

01:33:32.785 --> 01:33:35.154
I mean, you've had plenty
of people on your show

01:33:35.156 --> 01:33:38.357
that have had drinking problems,
or drug problems, or...

01:33:38.359 --> 01:33:40.025
They probably hit women.

01:33:40.027 --> 01:33:41.260
Sure, sure.

01:33:41.262 --> 01:33:42.628
But people didn't know
about it then.

01:33:42.630 --> 01:33:44.565
It's a brand new world now.

01:33:45.399 --> 01:33:46.999
I feel like
I'm being blamed.

01:33:47.001 --> 01:33:48.903
No. No.

01:33:50.404 --> 01:33:52.573
It makes no difference
to me, you see.

01:33:55.376 --> 01:33:56.909
It was an awful thing.

01:33:56.911 --> 01:33:58.711
I'm glad you got it
off your chest.

01:34:01.681 --> 01:34:04.752
I, uh, wanted to know
how you felt about it.

01:34:06.453 --> 01:34:08.887
I hire talented performers,

01:34:08.889 --> 01:34:12.057
but also people I know
I'm gonna feel comfortable with

01:34:12.059 --> 01:34:14.026
when shit hits the fan.

01:34:14.028 --> 01:34:15.829
- Hmm?
- Right. Yeah.

01:34:21.168 --> 01:34:22.770
I gotta think about it, Nina.

01:34:23.605 --> 01:34:25.472
Thanks for coming in
to see me.

01:34:28.242 --> 01:34:30.643
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, did you have your baby yet?

01:34:30.645 --> 01:34:33.045
Oh, yes. I had her
yesterday morning.

01:34:33.047 --> 01:34:34.213
She's real cute.

01:34:34.215 --> 01:34:37.816
No name yet, but I cannot
wait to get to know her.

01:34:37.818 --> 01:34:39.851
<i>So how was your interview
with Larry Michaels?</i>

01:34:39.853 --> 01:34:43.855
I don't know. It felt like I was
being interviewed by the patriarchy.

01:34:43.857 --> 01:34:46.124
He said he'd have to
think about it, so...

01:34:46.126 --> 01:34:47.159
Not getting it, right?

01:34:47.161 --> 01:34:49.394
Ooh. Yeah, that's not good.

01:34:49.396 --> 01:34:52.032
You know what? Fuck Larry
Micheals and his...

01:34:54.168 --> 01:34:55.437
Hi.

01:34:58.473 --> 01:34:59.771
Where are you
right now?

01:34:59.773 --> 01:35:01.576
Just saying hi
to a friend.

01:35:04.245 --> 01:35:05.777
Listen, can you book me?

01:35:05.779 --> 01:35:08.749
Will anybody book me? I need
to get back on the horse.

01:35:20.662 --> 01:35:22.129
- Hey, Nina.
- Mm-hmm.

01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:24.566
You've got two minutes.

01:35:26.033 --> 01:35:26.900
Yo.

01:35:27.469 --> 01:35:28.869
That viral video...

01:35:29.837 --> 01:35:31.071
Shit was dope.

01:35:32.507 --> 01:35:34.207
So don't fuck it up tonight.

01:35:34.209 --> 01:35:36.444
Thank you.
Thanks. Thanks.

01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:50.791
Where's you, Charlie?

01:35:53.328 --> 01:35:54.763
You should have
taken care of me.

01:35:57.632 --> 01:35:59.833
You should have looked out
for me just a little bit.

01:36:02.637 --> 01:36:04.572
I could have been
a contender.

01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:17.885
Who's the boss? Who's the boss?
Who's the boss?

01:36:20.922 --> 01:36:22.288
Who's the boss?
Who's the boss?

01:36:35.770 --> 01:36:38.438
<i>Whoa, Los Angeles.
Hi. Hi.</i>

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:43.309
<i>Thank you so much for coming to
see my follow up rape routine.</i>
