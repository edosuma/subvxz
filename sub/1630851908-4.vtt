- Cheers.

18:11.090 --> 18:15.178
- Cheers to my best friends.
- To new friends.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.599
Oh my God.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.017
- Whoo!

18:21.059 --> 18:22.644
- Hey, Haley's here!

18:27.106 --> 18:30.068
[laughing]

18:32.862 --> 18:36.282
It just reminds me of how Ali
and I were at the beginning.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.660
- Except we're totally
different. But...

18:38.701 --> 18:40.245
- We're totally different,
but just seeing their spark.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.788
Because, you know,
when you're...

18:41.830 --> 18:43.373
- Honeymoon stage.
- Yeah, the honeymoon stage,

18:43.414 --> 18:45.333
- I mean...
- You only get that once

18:45.375 --> 18:47.168
- with someone.
- You get that once.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.711
You remember when we used to...

18:48.753 --> 18:50.380
Oh, God, please.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.215
[Justin]: This is strong,
Olivia.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.300
I'm going to come visit you
if you make them like that.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.760
- She's been laying
low though, with drinks.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.886
She's been toning down
a little bit.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.346
- Well, she's looking for a new
job.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.265
She has been hanging
with me now,

19:00.306 --> 19:01.683
- so I don't know about that.
- Oh.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.936
Amanda is the brunette
version of Olivia.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.522
- I feel like it's so early on
that we're going to have to wait

19:07.564 --> 19:10.024
and see if Amanda is going
to be a good influence

19:10.066 --> 19:13.111
or a bad influence
because two Olivias

19:13.152 --> 19:15.154
is not always a good thing.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.698
- Sit here, baby.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.199
Let's sit in here.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.909
We're hanging out.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.911
- We're hanging out.
- Hanging out a little bit.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.499
The golden chariot.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.459
They're so cute together,
aren't they?

19:28.501 --> 19:30.712
- [Haley]: It's like her twin.
- Yeah. A little bit.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.881
[Brianna]: But maybe
a more reasonable twin.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.674
[Haley]: Maybe, we don't know
her that well yet.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.509
- She could use
someone a little more

19:36.551 --> 19:38.678
responsible to balance her out.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.346
[Haley]: Is she more
responsible though?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.932
- I don't know, we don't
really know her.
- Guess we don't know yet.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.934
- I don't know.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.644
When I first met Amanda,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.354
she has told me that she had
just recently gotten out

19:48.396 --> 19:51.190
of a really bad long-term
relationship

19:51.232 --> 19:53.067
and that she's not looking
for anything serious.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.695
I was like,
well, that's great

19:55.737 --> 19:57.363
because I'm definitely not
looking for anything serious,

19:57.405 --> 19:59.407
so we're perfect.
But I mean, I don't know.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.242
I think we both like
each other a lot

20:01.284 --> 20:03.161
and it could definitely
turn into something more.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.341

for a mile in Egypt.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.137

- They did.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.555
- John and Michael
are much bigger than us.

20:22.597 --> 20:23.723
So Renee has
been talking about

20:23.765 --> 20:25.224
these belly dancing costumes

20:25.266 --> 20:27.060
for, I don't know,
our whole relationship,

20:27.101 --> 20:28.895
and she's decided
to pull them out

20:28.937 --> 20:30.313
because she wanted me
to see them.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.814
She wanted Marissa
to see them again,

20:31.856 --> 20:33.149
because I guess
it's been years since they

20:33.191 --> 20:34.400
backpacked them through Egypt.

20:34.442 --> 20:35.860
- Oh, boy.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.986
Let's see what
kind of bullshit you have.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.280
- Oh, nice.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.699
Listen, I think one of
you guys should model

20:41.741 --> 20:44.118
them, or both of you,
and I'll take pictures.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.205
See if you can put
some on... What is it?

20:47.246 --> 20:49.916
Is it Marketplace or wherever?

20:49.958 --> 20:52.293
[Summer]: I don't know, who
buys belly dancing costume?

20:52.335 --> 20:54.337
Where do you find belly dancers,
like on Craigslist?

20:54.379 --> 20:56.005
Like who wants these?

20:56.047 --> 20:57.840
I mean, how do you even
approach that?

20:57.882 --> 20:59.968
These tasks... She's running
out of tasks to give us.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.886
That's the conclusion
I've come to.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.805
So now we're going to sell
belly dancing costumes.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.057
- Wait, I like this one.
- Oh, go for it.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.017
- Put it on.
- Yeah, that is pretty.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.560
I feel like you would
wear this to the beach.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.980
This looks like one
of your bikinis.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.314
- There you go.

21:14.649 --> 21:15.942
- Oh, I got a big head, I guess.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.443
- Put it on over your t-shirt.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.320
Looks great.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.656
Are you supposed to...?

21:21.698 --> 21:23.491
I don't understand.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.035
- Put one on, Marissa,
come on, dear.

21:26.077 --> 21:29.455
- I'm having PTSD as it is.
- But you did, 20 years ago.

21:29.497 --> 21:32.333
Because you forced me to
for seven or eight years
straight.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.293
- Yes, and it was fun.
You loved it.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.462
- Now I'm an adult,
and I don't have to do it.

21:36.504 --> 21:37.964
- You loved it.
- No, I didn't love it.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.632
- I hated it.
- I think that Marissa

21:39.674 --> 21:41.718
and Renee are a lot more
alike than they realize

21:41.759 --> 21:44.220
and sometimes that's
the root of the problem.

21:44.262 --> 21:45.596
You're at least putting
on a head piece

21:45.638 --> 21:46.597
if I'm putting
on a whole outfit.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.640
- Oh, gosh.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.060
This stinks like mildew.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.688
- I look like Aquaman.
- Yeah, that's a cool thing.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.065
I definitely feel like I have
to take sides sometimes.

21:56.107 --> 22:00.028
It's always Renee's,
out of pure fear.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.530
I just feel like how
are you going to side

22:02.572 --> 22:04.991
against your future
mother-in-law?

22:05.033 --> 22:06.492
[Renee]: Take it off for a
minute. Just take it off.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.119
Let's see if we
can make it work.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.454
- It's fully below her bra.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.997
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.457
- Oh, boy.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.500
- One went over there.
- Stop picking this.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.836
- I didn't pick it.
- All right.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.379
- About the beads, okay.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.548
Oh, I see y'all
are eating in the room.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.009
Against the rules.

22:25.762 --> 22:28.931
- Mom, seriously right now?

22:28.973 --> 22:32.894
- Are you kidding me?
- Ma, honestly. I'm 30.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.937
- I don't care if you are 90.
- I'm not a little kid.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.647
I'm not going to get it
all over the room.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.484
You know that I hate food
in the bedroom.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.861
- Mom...
- It'll stay there

22:41.903 --> 22:43.654
for a whole week before it
migrates to the garbage.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.239
- No, it won't.
- Oh, yes, it will.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.657
There's like coffee cups in here

22:46.699 --> 22:49.202
for a whole week and glasses.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.329
Yeah, come on, be serious.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.164
Sometimes I think Renee just
wants Marissa's attention.

22:53.206 --> 22:56.918
So she is annoying
to get some sort of reaction

22:56.959 --> 22:58.753
and it works.

22:58.795 --> 23:03.216
And sometimes you're annoying.
To her, not to me.

23:04.801 --> 23:08.179
- What's up, baby?
- Nothing.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.890
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just over it.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.476

23:13.518 --> 23:15.686

- One more week. One more...

23:18.856 --> 23:21.526
If it's more than a week,
I'm going to kill somebody.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.152
- You do this and then
you hurt her feelings

23:23.194 --> 23:24.654
because you storm off.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.864
- How does that
hurt her feelings?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.574
Because she likes going
through her stuff with us.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.576
One day you're gonna miss her.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.745
That's your mom.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.413
I'm gonna help her go clean

23:34.455 --> 23:36.249
because we just left her
in there with everything out.

23:36.290 --> 23:37.375
Let me help her pick up
the cushions.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.252

- She's pouting.
- Oh.

23:53.307 --> 23:56.519
So Summer said I made you cry?

23:56.561 --> 23:59.355
- I wasn't crying.
- Why did you get mad?

23:59.397 --> 24:01.858
Because you're telling me
to not eat in the room,

24:01.899 --> 24:03.901

do we have that we can

24:03.943 --> 24:05.987
watch a show
and be alone for a second?

24:06.028 --> 24:08.364
- The kitchen table. I like
to spend some time with you,

24:08.406 --> 24:10.324
but you go directly to the room.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.869

or the food in the room?

it is usually worth it.

The first time that she shared
her feelings with us,

27:06.417 --> 27:07.918
it was at the mall.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.880
- She would always use me
to calm my dad down.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.382
Because my dad, we just didn't
know how he would react

27:13.424 --> 27:17.345
to anything and then
I was just always the one

27:17.386 --> 27:19.597
that would get him
on his sweet side.

27:19.638 --> 27:24.226
She would be like, "Loosen him
up and then I'll tell him."

27:24.268 --> 27:28.022
She asked me to walk with my dad

27:28.064 --> 27:30.983
and I just told her,
just tell him.

27:31.025 --> 27:35.821
And she like hid in that store.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.990
And then when he came out,

27:38.032 --> 27:40.534
I let him walk out by himself
and she was outside

27:40.576 --> 27:44.413
waiting for him
and then they talked it out.

27:44.455 --> 27:47.583
I've never really had
that discussion with my dad

27:47.625 --> 27:49.960
about my coming out.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.922
When I came out, it was
really, really hard.

27:52.963 --> 27:56.342
My parents weren't okay with it.
They were not happy.

27:56.384 --> 28:01.639
I had to do counseling,
I had to go to church.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.184
It was just really,
really dark for me.

28:12.108 --> 28:17.613

and a half years

28:38.509 --> 28:42.847
before they finally,

28:42.888 --> 28:46.517
um, accepted it.

realize that you are

going to change.

Was she wearing
a g-string? I don't know.

37:14.149 --> 37:16.234
[laughter]

37:16.276 --> 37:18.111
Look, Olivia, I cannot.

37:19.529 --> 37:23.241
I love girls on poles,
so... Sorry.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.868
I don't think Amanda
would be upset at all,

37:24.910 --> 37:26.453
she would probably
do the same thing,

37:26.495 --> 37:27.996
we're very cool about that.

37:28.038 --> 37:29.915
It's more so like,

37:29.957 --> 37:32.292
"You're dancing in front of me,
I'm excited," kind of thing.

37:32.334 --> 37:34.962
[chattering]

37:35.003 --> 37:37.339
You look great.
You look great.

37:37.381 --> 37:39.299
[Summer]: Will you come talk
to me really quick?

37:39.341 --> 37:41.051
- Sure.

37:49.685 --> 37:51.269
What's up?

37:51.311 --> 37:53.021
I just want to
talk to you because I

37:53.063 --> 37:54.940
feel like at the softball game,

37:54.982 --> 37:57.109
I wasn't ready
because I was still

37:57.150 --> 37:59.903
a little heated about the
texts that you sent me.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.905
Look, this is from Haley,

38:01.947 --> 38:03.865
whom I hadn't even
spoken to that night.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.659
I actually, the last thing
I said to her, when I left,

38:05.701 --> 38:07.452
is "Thank you so much
for having us."

38:07.494 --> 38:09.746
"Brianna was just looking
out for you guys as friends.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.373
Clearly,
you both feel otherwise.

38:11.415 --> 38:13.333
You have a lot of fake shit
to say to our face

38:13.375 --> 38:15.460
and a lot of other things
to say behind our back.

38:15.502 --> 38:18.088
Run like you always do,
fake as fuck."

38:18.130 --> 38:21.425
I don't care for Murphy.
She hits on me

38:21.466 --> 38:23.510
and grabs me around
the waist and shit

38:23.552 --> 38:25.512
every single time
I'm out with her.

38:25.554 --> 38:27.806
Not the first time we
fucking heard that story.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.516
Wasn't she crying
to you about the fact

38:29.558 --> 38:31.727
that everybody thinks they're
in an open relationship.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.520
Woman to woman, I just
want to tell Haley

38:33.562 --> 38:35.856
the things that Murphy
has done not only to me,

38:35.897 --> 38:38.817
but I've heard multiple
other people say the same thing.

38:38.859 --> 38:40.902
I think that it's only fair
to let her know

38:40.944 --> 38:42.779
because I would hope
for the same respect

38:42.821 --> 38:44.406
if it were me in her position.

38:44.448 --> 38:47.492
And I just feel like
if I go into it calmly,

38:47.534 --> 38:49.995
respectfully and really try
to hash it out with her

38:50.037 --> 38:51.496
and let her know
that it's never been her

38:51.538 --> 38:53.206
that I had a problem with,
then hopefully

38:53.248 --> 38:55.292
she somewhat accepts
what I'm saying well.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.127
- I mean, I've heard
a lot of things

38:57.169 --> 38:58.754
about the car situation.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.172
I also heard several recordings,

39:00.213 --> 39:01.965
about what you were
saying about us.

39:02.007 --> 39:05.302
I think I don't really
understand the context.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.596
It's never been you, my
issue has never been with you.

39:07.637 --> 39:09.014
I've never been fake
towards you.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.766
It's always been Murphy.

39:10.807 --> 39:12.601
Yeah. But like why, though?

39:12.642 --> 39:15.812
- She has been
inappropriate with me

39:15.854 --> 39:17.105
time and time again
to the point

39:17.147 --> 39:18.607
where it just
makes me uncomfortable.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.984
- Like, how?
- Like grabbing on me,

39:21.026 --> 39:23.862
saying inappropriate things.

39:23.904 --> 39:27.115
She asked me to meet up with her

39:27.157 --> 39:30.786
at CrossFit to fuck
years ago.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.537
She didn't even go
to CrossFit years ago.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.789
- I don't know
why she said that.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.665
- She started, like, a year ago.
- Okay.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.959
I don't know anything about
if she goes to CrossFit at all.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.044
That just sounds like a lie.

39:39.086 --> 39:40.712
I'm telling you why...

39:40.754 --> 39:42.089
I'm just letting you know,
that sounds like bullshit.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.423
- Okay.
- I know my girlfriend.

39:43.465 --> 39:45.175
I've been dating
her for six years.

39:45.217 --> 39:46.176
- You're being defensive
while I'm trying

39:46.218 --> 39:48.345
to tell you why...

39:48.386 --> 39:49.346
No, but I'm just letting
you know that you guys

39:49.387 --> 39:51.056
are making up shit.

39:51.098 --> 39:52.557
- I've heard things that
it's not just with me.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.267
And I heard the first
time that we met you,

39:54.309 --> 39:56.019
you asked my girlfriend
if she's polyamorous.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.479
- Why do you think I asked that?
- It's interesting.

39:57.521 --> 39:59.022
I also think that Jordan
has been saying

39:59.064 --> 40:00.607
- that since I've known her too.
- She has.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.067
- Yeah. That's interesting.

40:02.109 --> 40:04.069
Because she's had
similar encounters.

40:04.111 --> 40:05.737
- That's literally bullshit.
- I'm telling you because

40:05.779 --> 40:07.405
I honestly like you, like I do.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.116
So, you can get mad
at me for saying it.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.909
I would be defensive
of my girlfriend as well,

40:10.951 --> 40:13.245
but I'm trying
to be honest with you.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.913
I heard your girlfriend
was cheating on you, so...

40:14.955 --> 40:16.498
- With who?
- [Haley]: Cuppie.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.333
[Haley]: In the beginning
of your relationship.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.043
They did talk
in the beginning.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.045
We weren't dating.
I don't have any secrets.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.464
Honestly, I don't believe
anything that you say.

40:24.506 --> 40:27.134
I think you're a snake and I
don't trust anything you say.

40:27.175 --> 40:30.178
- I feel really bad for you.
- I feel bad for you, too.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.264
- Okay.
- Yeah, good.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.099
- Hey, babe? Babe! Babe!

40:34.141 --> 40:35.559
Let's bring
Brianna over here too.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.310
Come here.

40:41.314 --> 40:42.941
- Are you okay?

40:42.983 --> 40:45.443
[Haley]: She's saying that
Brianna...

40:45.485 --> 40:47.737
...was inviting her
to Crossfit to fuck.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.447
- What?
- CrossFit?

40:49.489 --> 40:51.241
[Haley]: Yeah. Which,
like three years ago.

40:51.283 --> 40:53.285
[Haley]: But Brianna didn't
even do Crossfit a year ago.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.953
She doesn't believe
anything I say,

40:54.995 --> 40:56.746
I'm a snake and you've
been cheating on me

40:56.788 --> 40:58.582
with Cuppie in the beginning
of our relationship.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.418
[laughs] Hey, Cuppie,
apparently we're cheating.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.503
- Let's call it all out
because I'm ready.

41:03.545 --> 41:05.172
Apparently, me and you
were cheating on Summer

41:05.213 --> 41:07.090
in the beginning
of our relationship.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.217
But it only comes out once
I tell the truth about Murphy.

41:09.259 --> 41:11.136
- Because I've ever told Haley
or Murphy

41:11.178 --> 41:13.471
about my personal
business anyway.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.182
I can tell you
when we first stopped.

41:15.223 --> 41:16.933
- Were we official?
- No.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.685
Far from it.

41:18.727 --> 41:20.520
- I'm honestly about to rip
a bitch's hair out,

41:20.562 --> 41:21.938
so she needs to fucking shut up.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.648
So I thought it was
really messed up that

41:23.690 --> 41:26.484
Summer decided to wait
till Brianna

41:26.526 --> 41:28.361
wasn't around to pull me aside

41:28.403 --> 41:31.072
and talk bad
about Brianna to me.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.949
I thought that she was
genuinely sitting me down

41:32.991 --> 41:35.827
to like
reconcile our friendship.

41:35.869 --> 41:38.163
Even though we were never
close to begin with.

41:38.205 --> 41:43.460
I just really didn't expect
that to come out of her mouth.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.671
Summer sat me down, she's like,
"We need to talk" and all of
this,

41:46.713 --> 41:49.841
and she's like, "Brianna was
inviting me to go to CrossFit

41:49.883 --> 41:53.553
- to fuck three years ago."
- To go to CrossFit to fuck?

41:53.595 --> 41:54.888
- What?
- Yeah.

41:54.930 --> 41:56.264
She said you
were inappropriate...

41:56.306 --> 41:58.266
[Olivia]: You would
never do that.

41:58.308 --> 42:00.101
...and you were inviting her to
CrossFit to fuck. I was like,

42:00.143 --> 42:01.478
that's funny, Brianna
started CrossFit a year ago

42:01.519 --> 42:02.687
and she's like, "Oh, well...

42:02.729 --> 42:04.648
- I touched her at Crossfit?
- ...I don't knpw why she would
have said that."

42:04.689 --> 42:06.358
- She's trying to start shit.
- Did you'll fuck since then?

42:06.399 --> 42:08.485
- The day at brunch that
I saw you,

42:08.526 --> 42:09.986
we didn't fuck
that night at all.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.279
But I'm saying...

42:11.321 --> 42:13.240
- Since then at all?
- No.

42:13.281 --> 42:15.242
[Summer]: I know who I'm
dating.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.285
I trust Marissa,
and that's all that matters.

42:17.327 --> 42:19.746
I think Haley is just projecting
and trying to distract

42:19.788 --> 42:21.623
from the real situation,
which is the fact that her

42:21.665 --> 42:22.916
girlfriend is a cheater.

42:22.958 --> 42:24.834
- Wait, what was the story?

42:24.876 --> 42:26.378
What was the story?

42:26.419 --> 42:27.712
[Summer]: You're not gonna
run up on me like that.

42:27.754 --> 42:29.130
[Haley]: Apparently you
were inviting

42:29.172 --> 42:31.174
Summer to Crossfit
three years ago.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.259
How about you sit down, bitch.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.468
I'm sorry, what did say to me?

42:33.510 --> 42:34.719
How about you
sit the fuck down.

42:34.761 --> 42:36.054
- Why would I sit down?
- Sit down.

42:36.096 --> 42:37.764
- Why, because
you're super tall?

42:37.806 --> 42:39.307
- You're getting in her face.
- She got into my face!

42:39.349 --> 42:41.101
- No, she's not!
- What are you talking about,
she just stood over me?

42:41.142 --> 42:43.061
[Summer]: I need to be next to
my girlfriend, so you can move.

42:43.103 --> 42:44.187
[Summer]: Bitch, you in denial!

42:44.229 --> 42:46.231
[Summer]: Your bitch slimy!

42:46.273 --> 42:47.732
- Yo, what's the conversation?

42:47.774 --> 42:49.651
[Summer]: That you're a
fucking whore!

42:49.693 --> 42:51.152
[Olivia]: What's the real
issue?

42:51.194 --> 42:52.988
- What's the real issue?
She tried to cheat

42:53.029 --> 42:54.698
on her girlfriend
with the wrong motherfucker,

42:54.739 --> 42:56.616
me, and she's denying it.

42:56.658 --> 42:58.535
[Haley]: I know my girl. I've
been with her for six years.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.328
[Marissa]: Do you?

43:00.370 --> 43:02.247
[Jordan]: Then why did you cry
to me in a bathroom about her?

43:02.289 --> 43:04.374
What the fuck are you
talking about, bitch?

43:04.416 --> 43:05.959
- Don't. Don't. Don't.
- What?

43:06.001 --> 43:07.961
The rumors,
from what I've heard,

43:08.003 --> 43:09.879
aren't just rumors
because they're things

43:09.921 --> 43:12.299
that I've heard firsthand
from Brianna.

43:12.340 --> 43:14.426
She asked me if I would
rather sleep with her or Haley,

43:14.467 --> 43:16.720
because they were
in an open relationship.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.556
No one said
"I want to fuck Summer."

43:19.597 --> 43:21.766
I would... You couldn't
pay me to fuck that ho.

43:21.808 --> 43:25.353
- [all shouting]
- Bitch! Bitch!

43:25.395 --> 43:27.105
- I will! I fucking will!

43:27.147 --> 43:31.985
[all shouting]

43:32.027 --> 43:34.195
- Is that what's going on now,
bitch?

43:34.237 --> 43:36.114
- You hit me, bitch!
- Speak up! Speak up!

43:36.156 --> 43:38.158
Speak the fuck up!
