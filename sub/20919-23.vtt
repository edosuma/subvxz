<i>[Iron Man narrating] An alien named
the Beyonder took pieces of worlds,</i>

00:03.987 --> 00:07.898
<i>then mashed them together
to build Battleworld.</i>

00:07.900 --> 00:10.061
<i>[Captain America narrating] The people
from those places, including the Avengers,</i>

00:10.085 --> 00:12.069
<i>were brought to this world.</i>

00:12.071 --> 00:14.071
<i>The Beyonder calls this
his experiment.</i>

00:14.073 --> 00:16.331
<i>We call it
twisted and dangerous.</i>

00:16.408 --> 00:18.258
<i>After Loki joined our side,</i>

00:18.335 --> 00:19.738
<i>we tried to use
the Asgardian Bifrost</i>

00:19.762 --> 00:20.427
<i>to send everyone home.</i>

00:20.504 --> 00:21.687
<i>It didn't work.</i>

00:24.099 --> 00:25.858
<i>Loki and I rebuilt a new Bifrost</i>

00:25.934 --> 00:27.860
<i>so we can undo Battleworld</i>

00:27.936 --> 00:29.844
<i>and end the Beyonder's
experiment.</i>

00:29.922 --> 00:31.179
<i>But we're missing something...</i>

00:31.257 --> 00:32.756
<i>A mystery piece
of knowledge or tech.</i>

00:32.758 --> 00:36.777
<i>Until we find it,
the Bifrost won't work.</i>

00:36.853 --> 00:38.278
<i>Whatever the missing thing is,</i>

00:38.355 --> 00:40.947
<i>it's probably in the one place
we haven't found yet...</i>

00:41.024 --> 00:44.618
<i>The Beyonder's headquarters.</i>

00:44.694 --> 00:46.620
<i>The other Avengers
are scouring Battleworld</i>

00:46.696 --> 00:48.083
<i>for any sign of the Beyonder
or his base,</i>

00:48.107 --> 00:49.539
<i>but so far, no luck.</i>

00:51.610 --> 00:53.201
<i>We need to find the Beyonder.</i>

00:53.279 --> 00:55.212
<i>The sooner we end this,
the better.</i>

00:57.207 --> 01:01.134
[sighs] This would be
so much easier back on Earth,

01:01.211 --> 01:03.136
where I have a real lab
and equipment

01:03.213 --> 01:05.397
and interns
I can throw things at.

01:05.474 --> 01:06.714
Just do the best you can, Tony.

01:10.296 --> 01:11.553
Eh. Not the same.

01:11.630 --> 01:15.465
Besides, the best I can do
might not be good enough.

01:15.467 --> 01:17.801
Things have to be done right.

01:17.803 --> 01:20.304
Yaah! Oh, no. Come on... Aah!

01:20.306 --> 01:21.896
[sighs]

01:21.974 --> 01:23.974
They have to be done right,

01:23.976 --> 01:25.620
or the Beyonder's gonna
mop the floor with us.

01:25.644 --> 01:26.993
[grunts]

01:27.070 --> 01:28.328
Hey, we're all frustrated,

01:28.405 --> 01:30.071
but we're almost there.

01:30.149 --> 01:31.998
Now stay focused and try
not to get rattled.

01:32.075 --> 01:33.926
Save the speech,
Captain Perfect.

01:34.002 --> 01:36.320
I'm not one of your soldiers.

01:36.322 --> 01:37.170
You're gosh darn right
you're not.

01:37.247 --> 01:38.247
Why don't you call me

01:38.324 --> 01:40.991
when you're done
acting like a child?

01:40.993 --> 01:41.767
I'll be in the training room.

01:41.844 --> 01:44.085
"Gosh darn"?

01:44.163 --> 01:45.603
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

01:46.498 --> 01:48.774
Journal update number 1:
Cap is a jerk.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.352
Update 2: Tony Stark is awesome.

01:54.673 --> 01:56.673
Update 3: As soon as I
finish these repairs,

01:56.675 --> 01:59.195
Cap and I will join the others and
look for the Beyonder. [Thud]

02:01.864 --> 02:04.197
Heh heh heh heh heh.

02:04.274 --> 02:06.032
Update 4:
That's a really big ax!

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.380 --> 02:20.864
[growling] Stark!

02:20.866 --> 02:22.532
That would be me.
Don't know who you are,

02:22.534 --> 02:25.035
but not like you're the first
angry ax guy to come at me.

02:25.037 --> 02:28.963
I am Ares, Prince of War.

02:29.041 --> 02:32.267
Know my name. Know my power!

02:36.732 --> 02:37.732
Okay, Ares!

02:40.719 --> 02:42.161
Want to see something cool?

02:42.237 --> 02:43.403
Of course you do.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.480
Watch this.

02:52.915 --> 02:53.915
Hmm?

02:55.567 --> 02:56.567
Uh...

02:57.827 --> 02:59.160
Huh?

02:59.238 --> 03:01.755
Come get some, ax guy.

03:01.831 --> 03:03.131
[growling]

03:06.002 --> 03:08.428
Hey, watch it!
That's my equipment!

03:08.505 --> 03:10.080
No one trashes my stuff
except me,

03:10.082 --> 03:11.598
and occasionally the Hulk.

03:11.675 --> 03:13.508
Aah!

03:13.585 --> 03:16.511
Avengers, regroup at the Tower.

03:16.588 --> 03:18.249
Signal's jammed.
I take it that's your fault?

03:18.273 --> 03:21.366
[chuckling]

03:21.443 --> 03:23.777
Your Avengers friends
can't help you.

03:23.853 --> 03:25.704
I don't need your help
to smack you down.

03:25.781 --> 03:27.689
I've got an upgraded unibeam.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.449
[sputtering]

03:29.526 --> 03:32.436
Or I will have it once I fix it.

03:32.438 --> 03:33.438
Raah!

03:38.535 --> 03:42.128
Now let's open you up
like a tin can. Aah!

03:46.952 --> 03:49.377
Where did Ares come from?

03:49.455 --> 03:50.932
I think he's from Asgard
or something.

03:50.956 --> 03:51.996
Right? You're from Asgard?

03:52.791 --> 03:54.066
Asgard?

03:54.142 --> 03:55.976
Asgard?!

03:56.052 --> 03:58.128
You dare?!

03:58.130 --> 04:00.906
Ares is not from Asgard!

04:00.983 --> 04:02.315
Ares comes from Olympus!

04:05.729 --> 04:09.322
Asgardians are disgusting,
uncultured brutes!

04:09.399 --> 04:11.416
Nothing like
the refined Olympians.

04:11.493 --> 04:13.919
Funny. That's not
what Thor says.

04:13.996 --> 04:15.495
[growling]

04:15.572 --> 04:17.255
Yaah!

04:19.743 --> 04:21.485
Not helping, Tony.

04:21.487 --> 04:23.503
It's funny to make him mad.
Whoa!

04:23.580 --> 04:26.047
You'll suffer
for your insolence!

04:28.677 --> 04:30.102
Uhh! Yaah!

04:30.178 --> 04:31.661
Why are you here?

04:31.663 --> 04:32.721
What is this about, Ares?

04:34.516 --> 04:36.049
This is about Battleworld...

04:36.126 --> 04:39.093
An entire planet
dedicated to war.

04:39.171 --> 04:41.187
Is it not glorious?

04:41.264 --> 04:42.264
Yaah! Yaah!

04:45.344 --> 04:46.952
That explosion one of yours?

04:47.029 --> 04:48.269
No. I think it belongs to them.

04:50.198 --> 04:52.440
The Avengers are a disaster.

04:52.518 --> 04:54.293
We are the cleanup crew.

04:54.369 --> 04:55.369
Attack!

04:59.783 --> 05:01.374
Ee-yaah!

05:07.533 --> 05:10.383
Absorbing Man, make yourself
useful for once.

05:12.962 --> 05:15.722
I'm plenty useful, see?

05:16.966 --> 05:17.966
Huh?

05:19.711 --> 05:21.135
Raah!

05:21.213 --> 05:23.304
MODOK?

05:23.382 --> 05:24.526
I never pegged you
as a team player.

05:24.550 --> 05:27.308
I dislike working with others,

05:27.386 --> 05:29.444
except when it's
to destroy the Avengers.

05:31.056 --> 05:32.280
[sputtering]

05:35.427 --> 05:37.394
I'm calling a tactical retreat.

05:37.396 --> 05:38.706
Call it whatever you want,
but call it fast.

05:38.730 --> 05:39.730
Raah!

05:41.416 --> 05:44.918
As if there was anywhere
they could run from us.

05:44.994 --> 05:46.994
Crimson Widow!

05:47.072 --> 05:49.831
I could have triumphed
without your interference.

05:49.908 --> 05:52.576
Huh. Didn't look that way to me.

05:52.578 --> 05:54.411
Now quit your whining
and come on.

05:54.413 --> 05:57.856
[growling]

06:00.936 --> 06:01.936
[grunts]

06:03.179 --> 06:04.196
I have an idea.

06:04.272 --> 06:05.364
Just do what I do.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.924
Just do what you do?

06:07.926 --> 06:09.087
Nothing good
ever comes from that.

06:09.111 --> 06:09.776
[ball swishing] Huh?

06:09.853 --> 06:10.853
[grunting]

06:15.767 --> 06:16.767
Aah!

06:19.771 --> 06:20.771
I gotcha.

06:22.608 --> 06:24.124
<i>Dasvidanya.</i>

06:24.200 --> 06:25.200
Ha ha ha ha ha!

06:29.114 --> 06:30.114
Hold on, Cap.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.807
Nowhere to go, Cap,
except straight down!

06:43.128 --> 06:45.061
[grunts] Yaah!

06:49.635 --> 06:51.225
[laughing]

06:51.303 --> 06:53.820
You're doomed, Captain America.

06:53.897 --> 06:56.564
Doomed.

06:56.642 --> 06:58.825
Comm signals are still jammed.

06:58.902 --> 07:00.822
We got to try to hold them off
as long as we can.

07:06.151 --> 07:08.084
[grunts] Yaah!

07:15.661 --> 07:17.927
Cap! Aah!

07:21.667 --> 07:25.393
[Crimson Widow] Inform
our boss we have them.

07:35.013 --> 07:36.346
At least we're still alive.

07:36.348 --> 07:38.072
I'll have to take
your word for it.

07:42.779 --> 07:43.779
Ah.

07:45.357 --> 07:47.357
Absorbing Man, Ares,

07:47.359 --> 07:48.541
Crimson Widow, and MODOK.

07:48.618 --> 07:51.136
Not exactly the dream team.

07:51.213 --> 07:52.696
How and why did those four
come together?

07:52.698 --> 07:56.049
They'd work together if the
Beyonder ordered them to.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.034
If I can just get
to the Beyonder,

07:58.036 --> 07:59.202
I can figure this out.

07:59.204 --> 08:00.204
Got to get in his head.

08:02.632 --> 08:04.040
Careful what you wish for.

08:04.042 --> 08:04.966
Beyonder.

08:05.043 --> 08:06.651
If you wanted to hang out,

08:06.728 --> 08:08.153
you could have just texted me.

08:08.230 --> 08:08.987
Just kidding.
I have you blocked.

08:09.064 --> 08:11.490
Ah. Tony Stark.

08:11.566 --> 08:13.900
You and I have
things to discuss.

08:13.977 --> 08:14.977
Come with me.

08:16.888 --> 08:18.388
Huh?

08:18.390 --> 08:19.390
Tony!

08:20.408 --> 08:22.817
[grunting]

08:22.894 --> 08:25.486
[Crimson Widow] Aw, don't
look so distressed, Captain.

08:25.564 --> 08:28.173
We've come to keep you company.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.566
What does the Beyonder want?

08:29.568 --> 08:30.900
And what's your part
in all this?

08:30.902 --> 08:32.177
[laughing]

08:32.254 --> 08:33.586
The Beyonder only told us

08:33.663 --> 08:35.922
to catch Tony Stark.

08:35.999 --> 08:38.575
He didn't say nothing
about Captain America.

08:38.577 --> 08:40.592
[laughing]

08:40.669 --> 08:42.929
[MODOK]
Which means you're all ours.

08:46.918 --> 08:49.510
Well, all four of you
against unarmed me?

08:49.588 --> 08:51.178
That's not really fair.

08:51.256 --> 08:54.181
Aw. No need to worry, Captain.

08:54.259 --> 08:56.609
We'll try to make this
painless, mostly.

08:56.686 --> 09:00.113
Oh, it's not really me
I'm worried about.

09:02.284 --> 09:03.284
Aah!

09:16.448 --> 09:17.463
No!

09:19.284 --> 09:22.135
Eh. Collateral damage.

09:22.211 --> 09:23.469
Wait! Stop!

09:25.381 --> 09:26.398
Aah!

09:29.127 --> 09:31.811
Yaah! No! Wait! Aah!

09:35.967 --> 09:37.634
Aah!

09:37.636 --> 09:39.636
Need to borrow this for a sec.

09:39.638 --> 09:40.706
Thanks for coming to visit,

09:40.730 --> 09:41.730
but now I got to run.

09:43.733 --> 09:45.232
Get him!

09:45.310 --> 09:48.235
Uhh! Thanks a lot, Ares.

09:48.313 --> 09:49.904
That's my favorite hand.

09:49.981 --> 09:51.423
Don't be such a mortal.

09:58.156 --> 09:58.988
[crack]

09:58.990 --> 10:00.340
Ohh.

10:00.416 --> 10:02.100
Tony, you read me?

10:02.177 --> 10:03.602
[sighs] Still jammed.

10:06.331 --> 10:08.181
Can't have gotten far.

10:08.257 --> 10:09.257
Split up.

10:18.601 --> 10:19.843
What do you want with me?

10:19.845 --> 10:21.527
And what have you done with Cap?

10:21.604 --> 10:22.679
I just wanted to talk to you,

10:22.681 --> 10:26.107
without distraction,
without fighting.

10:26.184 --> 10:27.700
As for your second question,

10:27.777 --> 10:29.628
Captain America is fine.

10:29.704 --> 10:31.412
You can see him if you like.

10:33.375 --> 10:34.949
[Beyonder] Aw.

10:35.026 --> 10:37.785
It seems like your friend
has gotten loose.

10:37.863 --> 10:40.472
Shame. But my employees
are already on him.

10:40.548 --> 10:42.123
Ah, but enough about that.

10:42.200 --> 10:46.536
I see you've noticed the aqueous
resinoid polymer graphics.

10:46.538 --> 10:48.872
Impressive, isn't it?

10:48.874 --> 10:51.374
How did you manage
to create something with...

10:51.376 --> 10:52.800
This is your headquarters.

10:52.878 --> 10:54.486
Ha ha ha ha ha!

10:54.562 --> 10:56.804
This is my laboratory,

10:56.882 --> 10:58.990
where I do my best work.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.818
My Citadel, overlooking
all of Battleworld.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.480
So tell me, this whole thing,
Battleworld...

11:06.558 --> 11:07.666
Why go to all the trouble?

11:07.742 --> 11:10.168
For knowledge, of course.

11:10.245 --> 11:11.873
Knowledge is the only goal
worth pursuing...

11:11.897 --> 11:14.339
That and curiosity.

11:14.416 --> 11:15.893
Curiosity? That's
why you did all this?

11:15.917 --> 11:17.917
Tore worlds apart?

11:17.994 --> 11:19.585
Pitted everyone
against each other?

11:19.662 --> 11:21.346
When you're working in your lab,

11:21.423 --> 11:23.308
don't you ever do something
just to see what happens,

11:23.332 --> 11:24.924
because you can?

11:25.001 --> 11:26.667
I created this world,

11:26.745 --> 11:28.244
and I make no apologies for it.

11:28.246 --> 11:31.414
You didn't create anything.

11:31.416 --> 11:32.265
You just took things apart.

11:32.341 --> 11:35.935
I took pre-existing concepts

11:36.012 --> 11:37.489
and mashed them together
into something new.

11:37.513 --> 11:39.923
Men like you and I?

11:39.925 --> 11:43.350
Oh, we stand upon
the shoulders of giants.

11:43.428 --> 11:44.548
So your greatest achievement

11:44.612 --> 11:47.263
is straight stealing
and copying.

11:47.265 --> 11:48.689
My greatest achievement
is my armor.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.357
And I didn't stand on anybody.

11:50.435 --> 11:52.711
That was all me.

11:52.787 --> 11:55.288
Your greatest achievement
isn't your armor,

11:55.364 --> 11:56.864
and you and I both know it.

11:56.942 --> 12:00.626
You and I both know
why you stay up all night.

12:00.703 --> 12:03.370
You and I know why you
push yourself so hard,

12:03.448 --> 12:05.114
why you're terrified

12:05.116 --> 12:07.541
that some day
you'll be forgotten.

12:07.619 --> 12:10.377
Tony Stark's
greatest achievement...

12:10.455 --> 12:12.731
I haven't found it yet.

12:12.807 --> 12:14.223
And I know exactly how you feel.

12:29.491 --> 12:34.744
[singsongy] Come out, Captain.
We know you're in here.

12:36.982 --> 12:38.906
[singsongy] Captain!

12:38.984 --> 12:41.593
Captain!

12:45.915 --> 12:47.599
[MODOK] Spread out.
Ares, go that way.

12:47.675 --> 12:50.159
I'll go this way.
Huh? I said go that way.

12:50.161 --> 12:52.495
[Ares] I don't take
orders from you,

12:52.497 --> 12:53.997
you monstrous dunderhead!

12:53.999 --> 12:56.057
What did you say about my head?

12:57.836 --> 13:00.111
Aah! Uhh!

13:06.344 --> 13:08.453
We have one big difference
between us.

13:08.530 --> 13:10.604
I think ethics are just
as important as knowledge.

13:10.682 --> 13:13.958
Well, perhaps it's time
we talk as equals.

13:14.035 --> 13:17.687
Could you imagine this
for yourself?

13:17.689 --> 13:20.206
Working with me in my lab.

13:20.283 --> 13:22.041
Ha. You're offering me a job.

13:22.118 --> 13:25.361
If you knew how many hours late
I show up to work every day,

13:25.363 --> 13:26.712
you would not want to hire me.

13:26.789 --> 13:31.050
I have much to offer you,
more than just technology.

13:31.127 --> 13:33.970
I can offer... life.

13:35.206 --> 13:38.875
This orb will allow your cells

13:38.877 --> 13:41.486
to regenerate indefinitely.

13:41.563 --> 13:43.304
Immortality?

13:43.381 --> 13:45.231
That's not possible.

13:45.308 --> 13:47.474
Ah, it's not only possible,
it's here.

13:47.552 --> 13:50.736
If you had
ten of your lifetimes...

13:50.813 --> 13:52.738
Another thousand years...

13:52.815 --> 13:55.649
It would still only be a moment.

13:55.727 --> 13:58.077
But imagine all the things
you could do,

13:58.154 --> 14:00.730
all the things you could create,

14:00.732 --> 14:02.331
how many lives you could save.

14:03.902 --> 14:06.736
I would never work for you.

14:06.738 --> 14:07.973
[scoffs]
You wouldn't work for me.

14:07.997 --> 14:11.591
You'd work with me...
Together as equals.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.685
Join me. I'll restore
the universe.

14:13.761 --> 14:15.761
I'll undo Battleworld.

14:15.838 --> 14:17.856
Then together, you and I

14:17.932 --> 14:19.673
will combine our knowledge

14:19.751 --> 14:22.935
and reshape reality.

14:23.012 --> 14:25.530
Everything will be
back the way it was,

14:25.607 --> 14:28.816
except you and I
will make things better.

14:38.103 --> 14:39.103
[revving]

14:45.793 --> 14:47.610
Tony, time to get out of here.

14:47.612 --> 14:50.722
No. No, it's not, Cap, actually.

14:50.798 --> 14:52.426
I think maybe we've been
wrong about the Beyonder.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.875
What are you talking about?
Tony, the Beyonder is...

14:54.953 --> 14:56.710
The Beyonder is right.

14:56.788 --> 14:58.712
With this,
I could change everything.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.973
I could live forever.

15:01.050 --> 15:02.808
Live forever?
What are you talking about?

15:02.885 --> 15:05.364
Get your hand off me! I told you,
I'm not one of your soldiers.

15:05.388 --> 15:07.647
You're not thinking straight.

15:07.723 --> 15:09.390
It's not like you

15:09.467 --> 15:11.227
to just accept something
the Beyonder offers.

15:12.670 --> 15:14.153
Don't do this.

15:14.230 --> 15:16.080
It's already done.

15:16.157 --> 15:19.584
Remember how I couldn't get
my unibeam to work right?

15:19.661 --> 15:21.586
Funny thing is, I just fixed it.

15:49.932 --> 15:52.116
You're not the only one
who's been cheated by time.

15:54.512 --> 15:57.029
Think of everything
I could make up for.

15:57.106 --> 15:58.514
No, Cap!

15:58.516 --> 15:59.516
Don't do it!

16:05.690 --> 16:08.115
I can feel it already.

16:08.193 --> 16:09.525
I'm invincible!

16:09.527 --> 16:10.527
Ohh!

16:13.031 --> 16:15.214
Forget it, Cap.
Beyonder gave it to me.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.291
I intend to use it.

16:20.038 --> 16:23.130
I know how much power
the orb has,

16:23.208 --> 16:24.528
how tempting it can be.
I felt it.

16:27.378 --> 16:29.545
Immortality is not
what you think it is.

16:29.547 --> 16:30.989
I'm not sorry for getting frozen

16:31.065 --> 16:33.307
and waking up in the future,

16:33.384 --> 16:35.384
but I'm glad I never
had to make the choice.

16:35.386 --> 16:37.069
But I'm getting the choice.

16:37.146 --> 16:38.654
And all I can see
are possibilities.

16:41.559 --> 16:44.651
This is not where I expected
my experiment to go.

16:44.729 --> 16:46.487
Oh, ho ho ho ho ho,

16:46.564 --> 16:48.489
but sometimes
the pursuit of knowledge

16:48.566 --> 16:50.657
takes one to unexpected places.

16:50.735 --> 16:53.177
Beyonder, you don't
want us to stop them?

16:53.254 --> 16:57.423
We're happy to destroy either,
or both, of the Avengers.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.909
Ha. You won't.

16:59.911 --> 17:01.911
Not until I see where this goes.

17:01.913 --> 17:04.805
Tony, please, listen to me.

17:07.085 --> 17:08.509
That's close enough, Cap.

17:08.586 --> 17:10.435
I just want to talk.

17:10.512 --> 17:12.313
See? Look.

17:13.590 --> 17:14.590
Uhh!

17:15.260 --> 17:17.868
You're not thinking straight.

17:17.944 --> 17:19.095
Don't let it control you.

17:19.097 --> 17:20.930
Thanks for the pep talk.

17:20.932 --> 17:22.132
I'll take it under advisement.

17:24.285 --> 17:25.492
Aah!

17:27.605 --> 17:29.363
Have you lost your mind?

17:29.440 --> 17:30.882
Have you?

17:35.780 --> 17:37.129
[Absorbing Man]
Come on, Beyonder.

17:37.206 --> 17:39.799
If you're just gonna let
them whomp on each other,

17:39.875 --> 17:42.543
then let us get in
a few good licks!

17:42.620 --> 17:43.803
No.

17:43.879 --> 17:45.563
[muffled grunt]

17:45.640 --> 17:47.139
I must know who is willing

17:47.216 --> 17:49.141
to do what is necessary.

17:49.218 --> 17:50.851
This is what Battleworld is for.

17:56.225 --> 17:57.225
[grunts]

18:01.973 --> 18:03.072
Looking for this? [Beeping]

18:18.172 --> 18:19.413
You tired yet?

18:19.490 --> 18:21.048
I could do this all day.

18:22.585 --> 18:24.051
[both grunting]

18:27.089 --> 18:28.998
What are they up to? [Growling]

18:29.000 --> 18:32.443
Your bizarre obsession
with this thinking game

18:32.520 --> 18:33.611
has gone on too long.

18:33.688 --> 18:35.596
Hmm.

18:35.673 --> 18:36.948
Very well.

18:37.024 --> 18:38.432
Destroy them.

18:38.509 --> 18:40.192
[gasps] It's about time.

18:47.943 --> 18:50.110
Time's up. You finished?

18:50.188 --> 18:51.187
I think we're good.

18:51.189 --> 18:52.371
Raah!

18:56.619 --> 18:58.785
The entire fight was a ruse!

18:58.863 --> 19:01.139
Huh?

19:01.215 --> 19:03.699
Let's get one thing clear,
Beyonder.

19:03.701 --> 19:06.135
You're not as smart as me,
and you never will be.

19:15.229 --> 19:16.470
Ohh! Aah!

19:16.547 --> 19:18.063
Got what you needed?

19:18.140 --> 19:20.474
Hacked and downloaded
the schematic of the orb.

19:20.551 --> 19:22.218
It's all there...

19:22.220 --> 19:23.719
The code to power up
the Bifrost.

19:23.721 --> 19:25.112
Here you go. [Grunts]

19:26.391 --> 19:28.391
Ohh! Uhh! What was that?

19:28.393 --> 19:29.500
[grunting]

19:29.577 --> 19:31.160
We're done with it.

19:32.580 --> 19:34.488
The orb!

19:34.565 --> 19:36.665
You gotta go
through me to get it!

19:38.586 --> 19:40.336
Not if I take you all out first!

19:42.740 --> 19:45.257
Aah! Idiots!

19:45.334 --> 19:47.685
Gimme that! Gimme!

19:47.762 --> 19:49.745
No one gets the better of me!

19:49.747 --> 19:50.913
No one!

19:50.915 --> 19:54.341
I am the greatest intelligence!

19:54.419 --> 19:57.195
I am from Beyond!

20:00.516 --> 20:02.091
For a fake fight,
you hit me pretty hard.

20:02.093 --> 20:03.161
Don't you want to ask
if I'm hurt?

20:03.185 --> 20:06.853
No. I want to ask,
were you tempted?

20:06.931 --> 20:09.356
Sure. Who wouldn't be?

20:09.434 --> 20:11.358
It would have given me
the immortality

20:11.436 --> 20:13.527
to learn all the knowledge
in the universe,

20:13.604 --> 20:15.713
but it wouldn't teach me
how to use it wisely.

20:23.631 --> 20:26.615
[Ares]
Is the orb in MODOK's nose?

20:26.617 --> 20:29.209
Does it look like it's
still in my nose?

20:29.287 --> 20:30.877
Then where did it go?

20:30.955 --> 20:32.471
[grunting] What? Huh?

20:34.959 --> 20:35.958
Be gone.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.978
Aah! Aah!

20:39.054 --> 20:39.979
Huh?

20:40.055 --> 20:42.815
I've always liked you, Ares.

20:42.891 --> 20:43.649
Do you know why?

20:43.726 --> 20:46.077
Uh-uh.

20:46.153 --> 20:49.154
You exist to destroy things.

20:49.231 --> 20:51.565
Aye.

20:51.642 --> 20:53.309
That's gonna be useful
for what comes next.

20:53.311 --> 20:56.328
My experiment is nearly over,

20:56.405 --> 20:58.589
and I've learned much
from Battleworld.

20:58.666 --> 21:00.424
But it all leads to one clear

21:00.501 --> 21:03.744
and incontrovertible conclusion:

21:03.821 --> 21:05.746
The Avengers...

21:05.823 --> 21:06.823
must die.

21:08.326 --> 21:10.751
Heh heh.

21:10.828 --> 21:12.495
[Captain America]
A table with graphics?

21:12.497 --> 21:15.664
So you saw those guys chasing me
through the Beyonder's Citadel,

21:15.666 --> 21:16.735
and you didn't think to help me?

21:16.759 --> 21:18.109
And risk blowing our cover?

21:18.185 --> 21:20.503
Besides, I knew you were fine.

21:20.505 --> 21:22.021
You knew?

21:22.097 --> 21:23.377
I was pretty sure you were fine.

21:28.179 --> 21:29.120
You did it.

21:29.196 --> 21:37.196
We did it. We're ready.
