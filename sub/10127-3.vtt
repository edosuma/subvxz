IS HOW BABIES ARE MADE.

00:27.700 --> 00:31.200
I STILL DON'T
BELIEVE HIM.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.367
UH, BEFORE I FORGET,

00:32.367 --> 00:35.567
UH, NEXT FRIDAY WILL BE
COLLEGE RECRUITMENT DAY.

00:35.567 --> 00:38.367
REPRESENTATIVES
WILL BE HERE FROM,

00:38.367 --> 00:41.000
UH, USC, NYU,
AND RUTGERS.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.300
OH, AND MR. MATTHEWS,
YOUR INTERVIEW
WITH STANFORD

00:45.300 --> 00:47.834
HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED
FROM 3:00 TO 3:30.

00:47.834 --> 00:49.400
STANFORD?

00:49.400 --> 00:51.300
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

00:51.300 --> 00:52.600
OH, IT'S JUST
AN INTERVIEW.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.934
IT'S NOTHING
FROM NOTHING.

00:54.934 --> 00:56.033
CORY?

00:56.033 --> 00:57.100
WHEN WE WERE
LITTLE KIDS,

00:57.100 --> 00:58.200
YOU PROMISED ME

00:58.200 --> 01:00.567
THAT WE'D GO TO THE SAME
COLLEGE TOGETHER.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.367
DID I SAY THAT?

01:02.367 --> 01:05.500
YES, AND YOU ALSO
TOLD ME THAT IF I
GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL,

01:05.500 --> 01:07.567
YOU'D TAKE ME
TO VERMONT TO WATCH
THE LEAVES CHANGE.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.567
RIGHT, VERMONT.

01:09.567 --> 01:10.567
OCTOBER.

01:10.567 --> 01:12.000
WRITE IT DOWN.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.700
YOU KNOW I COULD NEVER
GET INTO STANFORD.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.700
WELL, STANFORD'S JUST
ONE OF THE MANY SCHOOLS

01:15.700 --> 01:16.734
I'M APPLYING TO, SHAWN.

01:16.734 --> 01:19.233
I'M ALSO APPLYING
TO WISCONSIN, PENN.

01:19.233 --> 01:22.800
[GASPS]
WISCONSIN AND PENN?

01:22.800 --> 01:25.100
WE NEVER
DISCUSSED THOSE.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.967
WELL, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
WISCONSIN OR PENN, SHAWNIE.

01:27.967 --> 01:29.734
IT CAN BE A SCHOOL
FROM YOUR LIST.

01:29.734 --> 01:30.767
WHAT'S ON YOUR LIST?

01:30.767 --> 01:31.900
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S ON MY LIST?

01:31.900 --> 01:34.033
NUMBER ONE,
I DON'T NEED A LIST

01:34.033 --> 01:35.500
BECAUSE
MY BEST FRIEND CORY

01:35.500 --> 01:36.500
WOULDN'T APPLY
TO ANY SCHOOL

01:36.500 --> 01:38.400
THAT I COULDN'T
GET INTO.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.200
YOUR LIST
MAKES ME FEEL BAD.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.033
SHAWN, IT--IT,
YOU KNOW,
IT'S EARLY.

01:44.033 --> 01:46.567
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT MY PLANS ARE.

01:46.567 --> 01:47.767
OH, INTERESTING.

01:47.767 --> 01:50.400
YOUR PLANS.
NOT OUR PLANS. HMM.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.600
DON'T YOU TAKE
THAT TONE WITH ME,
SHAWN HUNTER.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.834
I'M NOT
TAKING ANY TONE.

01:54.834 --> 01:57.867
IF YOU WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE
AT STANFORD, THEN GO.

01:57.867 --> 01:58.900
IN FACT, GO NOW.

01:58.900 --> 01:59.934
GIVE YOU PLENTY OF TIME

01:59.934 --> 02:01.834
TO START MAKING
YOUR NEW COLLEGE FRIENDS.

02:01.834 --> 02:03.300
BUT--BUT I DON'T
WANT TO MAKE
NEW FRIENDS.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.567
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:04.567 --> 02:07.100
MAYBE I SHOULD START
MAKING NEW FRIENDS,
TOO, HUH?

02:07.100 --> 02:09.233
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

02:09.233 --> 02:10.600
OH, WELL,
YOU NEED TO, CORY.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.000
WHAT DID YOU THINK?
THAT I WAS ALWAYS
GOING TO BE HERE?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.700
IS THAT
WHAT YOU THOUGHT?

02:14.700 --> 02:17.300
WELL...I'M NOT.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.767
SH--SHAWN,
WHAT ABOUT VERMONT?

02:19.767 --> 02:21.400
I PUT DOWN A DEPOSIT.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.934
SHAWN, I THINK
WE NEED TO TALK.

02:26.934 --> 02:29.400
NO. EVERYTHING'S FINE.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.200
OUR LITTLE CONVERSATION
THIS MORNING
WAS VERY HELPFUL

02:32.200 --> 02:35.000
IN MAKING ME REALIZE
THAT OUR ENTIRE
RELATIONSHIP

02:35.000 --> 02:37.300
HAS BEEN NOTHING
MORE THAN A LIE!

02:39.500 --> 02:40.667
MOVE ALONG,
MOVE ALONG.

02:40.667 --> 02:41.667
JUST A COUPLE
OF SENIORS

02:41.667 --> 02:44.133
REHEARSING
A LITTLE PLAYLET.

02:44.133 --> 02:47.600
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEING A LITTLE DRAMATIC
ABOUT THIS?

02:47.600 --> 02:50.200
DRAMATIC?
PERHAPS A LITTLE.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.600
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GOING TO GO LOOK
OUT THE WINDOW.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.100
I PAID A SKYWRITER
A LOT OF MONEY

02:54.100 --> 02:56.667
TO WRITE
"CORY, I HATE YOU"
IN THE CLOUDS.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.900
SHAWN?

02:59.900 --> 03:02.800
ARE--ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU AND SHAWN
ARE OK?

03:02.800 --> 03:03.800
OH, WE'RE JUST FINE.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.700
HE JUST SPENT
A LOT OF MONEY ON ME.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.200
I THINK
HE NEEDS TO VENT.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.500
SEE, THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP,
TOPANGA, YOU KNOW.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.767
I MEAN, IT--IT'S
ROCK SOLID, BABY.

03:13.767 --> 03:15.233
AAH!

03:15.233 --> 03:18.100
WHO ARE YOU, AND
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY SEAT?

03:18.100 --> 03:19.734
HIS NAME IS ANDY.

03:19.734 --> 03:20.734
WHO'S ANDY?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.100
HE'S MY NEW--

03:22.100 --> 03:23.200
BEST FRIEND?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.233
FRIEND.

03:24.233 --> 03:25.767
CORY, WE AGREED THAT
WE WERE GOING TO GO OUT

03:25.767 --> 03:26.767
AND MEET NEW PEOPLE.

03:26.767 --> 03:28.567
I'M NOT MAKING YOU
HAPPY?

03:28.567 --> 03:32.100
NO, CORY, IT'S--

03:32.100 --> 03:34.133
IT'S NOT YOU, OK.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.400
IT'S ME.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.700
AND RIGHT NOW
I JUST NEED MY SPACE.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.000
BUT WE'RE
STILL FRIENDS?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.500
AS OF RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE ARE.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.300
GIVE ME MY SPACE.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.867
HE'S GOT
A NEW BEST FRIEND.

03:52.867 --> 03:55.500
YOU'RE JEALOUS.
IT'S SO CUTE.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.500
NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.700
BUT 2 CAN PLAY
AT THIS GAME,
GIRLFRIEND.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.800
HI.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.500
HI.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.667
I'M--I'M LIONEL.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.867
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

04:11.867 --> 04:13.200
GRAPES?

04:13.200 --> 04:15.467
I'D LOVE SOME.

04:17.367 --> 04:21.800
I'M TAKING
ANOTHER BOY'S
GRAPES.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.400
OK, FIRST
COLLEGE PAPER.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.667
PLAYING
WITH THE BIG BOYS.

04:31.667 --> 04:35.133
10,000 WORDS.
WORD NUMBER ONE.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.667
I WANT MY MOMMY!

04:39.734 --> 04:41.667
HA. THAT'S 3 WORDS.

04:41.667 --> 04:42.667
COME ON, ERIC.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.100
YOU HAD 3 WEEKS
TO WRITE THIS PAPER.

04:44.100 --> 04:47.467
YOU DON'T MAKE FUN
OF MY LEARNING DISABILITY!

04:47.467 --> 04:49.567
YOU HAVE
A LEARNING DISABILITY?

04:49.567 --> 04:51.734
I WOULD THINK SO.

04:52.967 --> 04:55.033
HEY, WAIT--WAIT.
WHAT DID YOU WRITE
YOURS ABOUT?

04:55.033 --> 04:56.500
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.600
OOH, A LAPTOP.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.567
FOR YOUR LAP.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.000
HERE IT IS.
10,000 WORDS.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.500
A PERFECTLY CRAFTED
ESSAY ON MY SUMMER
IN CHINA

05:04.500 --> 05:06.567
WORKING WITH
PALEONTOLOGISTS.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.100
PPPPTT!

05:09.100 --> 05:10.100
WHAT?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.500
YOUR FIRST
COLLEGE PAPER,

05:11.500 --> 05:13.000
YOU'RE WRITING
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID ON
YOUR SUMMER VACATION.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.300
I UNCOVERED
DINOSAUR FOSSILS.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.300
YOU GOT PICTURES?

05:15.300 --> 05:16.300
NO.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.000
THEN YOU GOT NOTHING.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.400
I THINK
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.567
PRE--

05:20.567 --> 05:21.934
YOU DON'T GET IT.
WE'RE IN COLLEGE NOW.

05:21.934 --> 05:24.100
WE'RE BEING JUDGED
ON A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.200
UH, THEORIES
AND FOOTNOTES,

05:26.200 --> 05:28.800
SHADES OF MEANING,
NUANCE, SPELLING.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.834
WHERE DOES IT END?
WHERE DOES IT END?

05:30.834 --> 05:34.000
ALL RIGHT!
I DIDN'T EVEN GO!

05:34.000 --> 05:37.200
MY SISTER WENT.
SHE'S 10.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.133
I GOT NO PICTURES.
AND I DIDN'T GO
TO CHINA.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.567
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.
IT'S OK.

05:42.567 --> 05:44.567
I'M GOING TO GET US
THROUGH THIS,
ALL RIGHT, MY FRIEND?

05:44.567 --> 05:46.300
THIS IS WHERE
ERIC MATTHEWS SHINES.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.500
HOW? WE PULL
AN ALL-NIGHTER?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.400
WORK TOGETHER
UNTIL IT'S GREAT?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.700
I GOT BETTER.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.567
WE MAKE FRIENDS
WITH THE DEAN.

05:57.300 --> 06:00.700
COR? IT'S 6:00.

06:00.700 --> 06:01.800
YOU'RE IN
YOUR PAJAMAS.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.700
IS
EVERYTHING OK?

06:03.700 --> 06:05.000
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.834
CORY AND SHAWN
HAD A FIGHT.

06:06.834 --> 06:07.967
SHAWN DUMPED HIM.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.867
NOW,
NOBODY GOT DUMPED.

06:09.867 --> 06:12.934
WE JUST AGREED
NOT TO SEE EACH
OTHER FOR AWHILE.

06:12.934 --> 06:14.667
AND YOU BELIEVE THAT?

06:14.667 --> 06:18.033
WELL, UM, SOMEONE
FROM SCHOOL CALLED--
A LIONEL.

06:18.033 --> 06:20.500
IS THAT
YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND?

06:20.500 --> 06:23.133
HE--HE'S
JUST THIS GUY
FROM SCHOOL.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.767
IF HE CALLS AGAIN,
TELL HIM
I'M NOT HOME.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.000
THAT'S NO WAY
TO TREAT HIM.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.133
HE'LL DUMP YOU, TOO.

06:28.133 --> 06:30.800
HEY, EVERYBODY.
HEY, COR.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.000
I HAD LUNCH
AT PINK'S TODAY.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.734
HOW COME I DIDN'T
SEE YOU THERE?

06:33.734 --> 06:35.300
WHY WOULD YOU?

06:35.300 --> 06:36.767
SHAWN WAS THERE.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.800
WAS HE...

06:38.800 --> 06:40.200
ALONE?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.500
UH, NO. HE WAS
WITH A COUPLE OF GUYS.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.133
A COUPLE OF GUYS.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.400
WHAT ARE YOU
SO UPSET ABOUT?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.467
PINK'S
WAS OUR PLACE.

06:48.467 --> 06:49.700
NOT ANYMORE.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.967
MOTHER,
MAKE HER STOP.

06:51.967 --> 06:53.000
CORY, WHAT
IS GOING ON?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.500
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.133
IT'S 2 PEOPLE MOVING
IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS,
THAT'S WHAT.

06:57.133 --> 06:58.400
NOW IF
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

06:58.400 --> 06:59.967
I'M GOING
INTO THE NEXT ROOM
TO WATCH LIFETIME

06:59.967 --> 07:01.300
AND HAVE A GOOD CRY.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.934
IS EVERYTHING
OK BETWEEN...
HIM AND TOPANGA?

07:07.934 --> 07:09.600
GREAT.
NEVER BETTER.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.100
WHEN THEY KISS,
HE ENJOYS IT, RIGHT?

07:17.834 --> 07:19.500
LET'S JUST GO HOME AND
WRITE OUR PAPERS, MAN.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.500
NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.667
WE'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE TO.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.600
YOU SEE, THE BEAUTY
OF BEFRIENDING
THE DEAN IS

07:23.600 --> 07:25.300
HE'S GOING TO GIVE
US AN EXTENSION
ON OUR PAPER.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.800
WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO HAVE TO DO IT

07:26.800 --> 07:28.567
OR ANY PAPER
THEREAFTER.

07:28.567 --> 07:30.467
WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO HAVE TO DO
ANY REAL WORK

07:30.467 --> 07:33.300
UNTIL WE GRADUATE,
GET JOBS, BEFRIEND
OUR BOSSES,

07:33.300 --> 07:35.500
GET MARRIED,
BEFRIEND OUR WIVES.

07:35.500 --> 07:39.000
PLEASE, MAN, I--I
JUST WANT TO GO
TO COLLEGE.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.133
I JUST WANT
TO DO THE WORK--

07:40.133 --> 07:43.367
HEY,
I LIKE YOU TOO MUCH
TO LET YOU DO THAT.

07:43.367 --> 07:45.300
OH, THANKS, MAN.
I LIKE YOU, TOO.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.700
HEY, THANKS.
OH, DEAN.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.300
NOT NOW.
OK.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.100
HEY, HEY, HEY.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.500
HE'S GONNA
LOVE US.

07:53.867 --> 07:55.500
OH, DEAN?

07:55.500 --> 07:57.000
YOU DON'T LISTEN,
DO YOU?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
JACK, BOW.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.467
WHAT?
BOW YOUR HEAD.

07:59.467 --> 08:02.200
UM, SIR, WE'D
ACTUALLY JUST LIKE
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU

08:02.200 --> 08:03.467
UH, UH, A PAPER
THAT WE'RE WRITING

08:03.467 --> 08:05.667
AND PERHAPS EVEN
ESTABLISH THE TYPE
OF RELATIONSHIP

08:05.667 --> 08:07.934
I HAD WITH
MY FORMER MENTOR,
MR. FEENEY.

08:07.934 --> 08:11.800
YOU KNOW
THE KIND OF PEOPLE
THAT HAVE MENTORS?

08:11.800 --> 08:14.300
PEOPLE WHO
CAN'T THINK
FOR THEMSELVES.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.400
WEAK PEOPLE.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.500
YOU'RE IN COLLEGE
NOW, BUDDY BOY.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.233
THE BIG LEAGUES.
THE SHOW.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.667
I'VE GOT OVER
25,000 STUDENTS
IN THIS UNIVERSITY,

08:23.667 --> 08:28.500
AND EACH ONE OF THEM
LINED UP TO KISS
MY DEAN BUTT,

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
LOOKING
FOR AN EASY WAY.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.200
BUT I'M GOING TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

08:32.200 --> 08:36.100
THE ONLY EASY WAY
IS THE HARD WAY.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.734
YOU DON'T SAY MUCH,
PRETTY BOY.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.000
I'M VERY SCARED, SIR.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.367
GOOD.

08:41.367 --> 08:43.967
THAT'S HOW I
BECAME THE DEAN.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.500
WE'RE SO IN.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.567
CORY, UM, I KNOW
THAT YOU AND SHAWN

08:53.567 --> 08:55.300
ARE HAVING SOME
PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.

08:55.300 --> 08:58.233
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS THE TIME
TO BRING HIM UP. HMM?

09:00.200 --> 09:02.934
DID YOU KNOW THAT LIONEL
HAS A REALLY WONDERFUL
SINGING VOICE?

09:04.467 --> 09:06.967
CORY, COME HERE.
I WANT TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.367
DID YOU ENJOY THAT?

09:16.367 --> 09:17.600
YES, MA'AM.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.100
OK, GOOD.
NOW LISTEN TO ME.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.800
BEING A SENIOR IS
A VERY SCARY TIME.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.567
WE HAVE
A LOT OF DECISIONS
WE NEED TO MAKE.

09:23.567 --> 09:24.834
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.100
OK, AND YOU'RE
PROBABLY GOING
TO HAVE YOUR CHOICE

09:26.100 --> 09:28.500
OF SCHOOLS
TO GO TO ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.100
YEAH, BUT
THAT DOESN'T MEAN

09:30.100 --> 09:32.000
SHAWN HAS TO BE UPSET
WITH ME FOR THAT.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.200
HE'S NOT.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.367
HE'S JUST AFRAID
HIS BEST FRIEND
IS MOVING ON

09:35.367 --> 09:36.734
AND LEAVING HIM
BEHIND.

09:36.734 --> 09:38.000
YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.
I MEAN--

09:38.000 --> 09:42.567
HE'S PROBABLY OFF
SOMEWHERE, ALONE...

09:42.567 --> 09:44.300
MISERABLE...

09:45.600 --> 09:48.500
HE'S IN DENIAL.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.100
3 GUYS.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.600
I'M ONLY
WITH LIONEL.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.500
CORY, TALK TO HIM.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.233
SHAWN?

09:58.300 --> 10:00.100
BOYS.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.734
WELL, THIS
CERTAINLY APPEARS
TO BE A LOT MORE

10:03.734 --> 10:06.200
THAN JUST GIVING
EACH OTHER SPACE,
HMM?

10:06.200 --> 10:09.567
CORY, WE AGREED
THAT WE WERE GOING
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.734
NO, YOU AGREED.

10:10.734 --> 10:12.200
I WAS PERFECTLY
HAPPY WITH THE WAY
THINGS WERE.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.467
THEN EXPLAIN HIM!

10:15.500 --> 10:16.800
HIS NAME IS LIONEL.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.100
WE MET TODAY, AND
WE ARE GETTING ALONG
JUST FAMOUSLY,

10:20.100 --> 10:21.133
BECAUSE I'M YOUNG,
HUNTER,

10:21.133 --> 10:23.100
I'M VITAL, AND
I HAVE A LOT TO OFFER.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.100
YEAH, WELL,
SO DO I.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.200
THE DIFFERENCE IS
I HAVE THE DIGNITY

10:25.200 --> 10:27.734
TO KEEP MY FRIENDSHIPS
PERSONAL AND PRIVATE,

10:27.734 --> 10:30.834
NOT PARADE THEM AROUND
IN PUBLIC FOR YOUR
TWISTED AMUSEMENT.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.300
YOU LITTLE PUNK!

10:32.300 --> 10:34.400
YOU DIRTY MAN!

10:34.400 --> 10:36.567
CAT FIGHT.

10:36.567 --> 10:38.400
AAH!

10:38.400 --> 10:39.400
AAH!

10:39.400 --> 10:40.700
FACE IT, MATTHEWS.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.133
OUR FRIENDSHIP
NEVER MADE ANY SENSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

10:43.133 --> 10:45.100
YOU'RE RIGHT. WHY?

10:45.100 --> 10:46.734
BECAUSE
WE'RE DIFFERENT.

10:46.734 --> 10:48.567
YOU'RE COLLEGE.
I'M TOWNIE.

10:48.567 --> 10:49.567
IT WAS ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

10:49.567 --> 10:50.567
BEFORE THAT
CAUGHT UP WITH US.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.567
THEN LET'S END IT NOW

10:51.567 --> 10:53.800
BEFORE IT LASTS
ANY LONGER THAN IT DID.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.567
NO! NOW.

10:56.567 --> 10:58.734
COME ON, BOYS.

11:04.734 --> 11:06.200
CORY, WHY DO I
HAVE TO BE HERE?

11:06.200 --> 11:08.300
LIONEL, IT'S NO SECRET
THAT SHAWN AND I

11:08.300 --> 11:10.133
WENT THROUGH
A PRETTY BRUTAL BREAKUP.

11:10.133 --> 11:12.133
NOW, THINGS
COULD GET UGLY.

11:12.133 --> 11:13.700
AND IF A PUNCH
GETS THROWN,

11:13.700 --> 11:17.834
WELL, I NEED YOU
TO TAKE IT.

11:17.834 --> 11:20.133
I WILL DO THAT
FOR YOU.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.233
OK, GREAT.

11:21.233 --> 11:23.800
NOW, KNOWING SHAWN
AND HOW VINDICTIVE
HE IS,

11:23.800 --> 11:25.834
HE PROBABLY
HAS NO INTENTION

11:25.834 --> 11:28.467
OF GIVING ME
MY STUFF BACK.

11:31.467 --> 11:34.400
WHERE DOES IT END?

11:35.467 --> 11:38.200
SHAWN? I KNOW
YOU'RE IN THERE.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.300
NOT ANSWERING.
HE MUST BE HURTING.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.033
GOSH,
I'M LOVING THIS.

11:42.033 --> 11:44.600
KIRK, IT'S
ABOUT TIME. OH.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.867
IT'S YOU.

11:45.867 --> 11:49.400
I'M, UH--I'M
HAVING A PARTY.
WHAT?

11:49.400 --> 11:53.400
OH, YEAH.
A PARTY, RIGHT.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.834
THAT CERTAINLY
IS SOME SHINDIG.

11:58.834 --> 11:59.867
YEAH, YOU KNOW.

11:59.867 --> 12:00.967
JUST POUNDING DOWN
SOME SODAS,

12:00.967 --> 12:03.400
SWAPPING A FEW
STORIES WITH SOME
CLOSE FRIENDS.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.400
CLOSE FRIENDS?

12:04.400 --> 12:05.400
YOU HARDLY KNOW THEM.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.100
EXACTLY.
SO IF THEY LEAVE,
WHO CARES?

12:08.100 --> 12:10.600
GET OUT,
ALL OF YOU!

12:10.600 --> 12:12.867
NOW GET
BACK IN THERE!

12:12.867 --> 12:14.300
YOU SEE,
NO EMOTIONAL
ATTACHMENT,

12:14.300 --> 12:15.300
NOBODY GETS HURT.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.867
THAT'S MY KIND
OF FRIENDSHIP, BABY.

12:16.867 --> 12:19.934
SO? THIS IS IT?

12:19.934 --> 12:21.367
I GUESS SO.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.200
WELL, IT'S
BEEN A FUN RUN.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.233
IT HAS BEEN.

12:25.233 --> 12:28.834
HEY. REMEMBER THE TIME
WE ATE CAKE

12:28.834 --> 12:29.900
IN THE PARAMUS MALL?

12:29.900 --> 12:31.600
CORY, PLEASE DON'T.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.200
NO EMOTION.
IT--IT'S TOO HARD.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.100
HAVE A NICE,
YOU KNOW...

12:37.100 --> 12:38.300
WHATEVER.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.600
I DON'T HATE YOU.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.600
JUST GO.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.600
LIONEL,
WE'RE THROUGH HERE.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.133
LIONEL? LIONEL?

12:50.133 --> 12:53.000
IF YOU GUYS EVER
PLAY BASKETBALL,

12:53.000 --> 12:54.800
MAKE SURE THERE'S
PLENTY OF WATER
AROUND

12:54.800 --> 12:57.200
BECAUSE CORY
TENDS TO DEHYDRATE.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.600
LIONEL?

12:58.600 --> 13:00.567
AND--AND LET HIM WIN
ONCE IN A WHILE.

13:00.567 --> 13:01.834
HE LIKES THAT.

13:01.834 --> 13:07.200
AND, LIONEL,
NEVER EAT CAKE
IN PARAMUS.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.467
THAT'S OURS.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.300
DEAN BORACK?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.500
DEAN BORACK!

13:32.500 --> 13:34.967
LOOK, I WAS
A VERY GOOD STUDENT
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

13:34.967 --> 13:36.100
I CAN WRITE THIS PAPER.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.100
I'M GOING HOME.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.834
FINE, GO.
HIGH SCHOOL BOY.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.200
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

13:41.200 --> 13:43.567
WHAT? NOTHING.
DIDN'T MEAN A THING.

13:43.567 --> 13:44.567
JUST MEANT
THAT HIGH SCHOOL

13:44.567 --> 13:45.867
WAS A VERY IMPORTANT
TIME IN YOUR LIFE.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.200
PROBABLY THE BEST
YEARS YOU'RE EVER
GOING TO HAVE.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.700
YOU WON A FEW
SPELLING BEES,

13:48.700 --> 13:49.700
YOU TOOK OUT
THE PROM QUEEN,

13:49.700 --> 13:51.800
YOU PEAKED EARLY.
GOOD FOR YOU.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.100
DEAN BORACK?

13:55.100 --> 13:56.900
HUH?

13:56.900 --> 13:57.934
OH, UH,
HELLO, DEAN.

13:57.934 --> 13:59.200
UH, ERIC MATTHEWS.
MY CHUM JACK.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD PUT
ON A POT OF COFFEE,

14:00.800 --> 14:02.734
INVITE US IN,
AND PERHAPS
WE COULD DISCUSS

14:02.734 --> 14:04.100
THE EXTENSION
ON OUR PAPERS.

14:04.100 --> 14:07.600
WE BROUGHT A BABKA.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.734
A BABKA?

14:08.734 --> 14:11.734
YOU BUMS THINK
YOU'RE GOING
TO BUY ME OFF

14:11.734 --> 14:13.934
WITH A STINKING
BABKA?

14:13.934 --> 14:14.934
HILDY.

14:14.934 --> 14:16.133
WE'RE GOING TO MEET
HIS DAUGHTER.

14:16.133 --> 14:19.467
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET
MY DOBERMAN.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.834
MAKE NO MISTAKE
ABOUT IT, BOYS,

14:20.834 --> 14:23.500
I AM A NASTY,
NASTY MAN.

14:24.567 --> 14:26.400
LEAVE THE BABKA.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.667
MR. FEENEY?

14:32.667 --> 14:34.767
MR. FEENEY?

14:34.767 --> 14:36.700
M--

14:36.700 --> 14:39.033
I WAS
EXPECTING YOU.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.233
TODAY, TOMORROW,
YESTERDAY.

14:41.233 --> 14:42.734
IT WAS ONLY A
MATTER OF TIME.

14:42.734 --> 14:46.200
UH, LOOK, MR. FEENEY.
THIS IS MY ROOMMATE
JACK.

14:47.233 --> 14:51.100
WHY DOESN'T HE
LOOK AT ME?

14:51.100 --> 14:53.800
I'M AFRAID, SIR.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.600
MR. FEENEY,
WE'RE BOTH SCARED,
OK?

14:56.600 --> 14:57.700
UH, UH, TOMORROW
WE'VE GOT TO HAND IN

14:57.700 --> 14:59.033
OUR FIRST COLLEGE
PAPER.

14:59.033 --> 15:01.500
W--WHAT IF THEY FIND
OUT WE'RE NOTHING
MORE THAN FAKES?

15:01.500 --> 15:05.400
GENTLEMEN, GETTING
ACCEPTED INTO COLLEGE
IS NOT A RANDOM ACT.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.567
YOU BOTH WERE ACCEPTED
ON YOUR MERITS.

15:08.567 --> 15:11.233
AND BY VIRTUE OF THAT
ALONE, YOU BELONG.

15:11.233 --> 15:14.200
NOW, WHAT'S THE TOPIC
OF YOUR PAPER?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.200
IT'S AN OPEN ASSIGNMENT.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.500
YOU CAN WRITE
ON ANYTHING YOU WANT.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.867
NO RULES, NO GUIDELINES,
NO PARAMETERS.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.934
IT DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE TO BE IN ENGLISH.

15:21.934 --> 15:23.867
YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT?

15:23.867 --> 15:26.133
UH, NO, HMM.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.800
OK, WELL, THE BEST
ADVICE I CAN GIVE YOU

15:28.800 --> 15:31.400
IS TO WRITE ABOUT
SOMETHING PERSONAL.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.033
PERHAPS ABOUT,
UH, THE ANXIETY
YOU'RE FEELING.

15:35.033 --> 15:37.900
YES. THAT'S IT.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.567
THE ANXIETY.
MR. FEENEY.

15:40.567 --> 15:43.200
FEENEY AND ERIC,
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.767
JUST LIKE
THE OLD DAYS.

15:44.767 --> 15:47.567
I MAKE YOU
LOOK SO GOOD.

15:49.734 --> 15:51.900
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:51.900 --> 15:53.367
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT HANDING IN
A PAPER I WROTE

15:53.367 --> 15:56.500
ABOUT UNCOVERING
DINOSAUR FOSSILS
IN CHINA.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.467
YOU GOT PICTURES?

16:00.967 --> 16:02.900
THEN YOU
GOT NOTHING.

16:05.567 --> 16:06.567
AH, MR. FEENEY.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.033
I GOT A MESSAGE
YOU WANT TO SEE ME.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.934
YOU HAVE 2 EXTRA TICKETS
TO SUNDAY'S EAGLES GAME.

16:10.934 --> 16:12.200
HEY, MR. FEENEY.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.734
I HEARD YOU HAD
AN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT
AWARD FOR ME?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.934
YOU!
YOU!

16:18.934 --> 16:21.400
STING!
STING!

16:21.400 --> 16:24.300
OH, SIT DOWN!

16:25.567 --> 16:26.567
MR. FEENEY?

16:26.567 --> 16:28.867
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS
TO US?

16:28.867 --> 16:30.900
I ASKED HIM
TO SEE YOU.

16:30.900 --> 16:31.900
[GASPS]
[GASPS]

16:31.900 --> 16:34.700
TOPANGA?
TOPANGA?

16:35.800 --> 16:37.033
YOU WON'T LISTEN
TO ME.

16:37.033 --> 16:38.100
YOU WON'T LISTEN
TO EACH OTHER.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.200
MAYBE YOU'LL LISTEN
TO MR. FEENEY.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.200
WELL, IT HASN'T
HAPPENED YET.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.300
BUT I'LL
TAKE A SHOT AT IT.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.700
OK, WHO WANTS
TO START?

16:46.700 --> 16:48.200
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.300
ME NEITHER.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.900
OK, THAT WAS
MY BEST SHOT.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.200
WHAT?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.500
MR. FEENEY,
THESE PEOPLE ARE ABOUT
READY TO THROW AWAY

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
10 YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP,

16:56.500 --> 16:59.033
AND YOU CALL THAT
YOUR BEST SHOT?

16:59.033 --> 17:02.600
SHAME ON YOU.
SHAME.

17:04.100 --> 17:07.033
I SHOW UP.
I TEACH.

17:07.033 --> 17:08.934
WHY ISN'T THAT
ENOUGH?

17:08.934 --> 17:10.033
WHY?

17:10.033 --> 17:12.867
LOOK, MR. FEENEY,

17:12.867 --> 17:13.867
LET'S NOT WASTE
ANYONE'S TIME, OK?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.834
CORY AND I,
WE BROKE UP.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.300
IT SHOULD HAVE
HAPPENED SOONER.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.934
BUT WE STAYED TOGETHER
FOR THE KIDS.

17:23.934 --> 17:26.800
IN THE CLASS.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.934
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN
THE BEST OF FRIENDS

17:29.934 --> 17:31.367
FOR AS LONG
AS I KNOW YOU.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.700
NOW WHEN DID
THIS PROBLEM START?

17:33.700 --> 17:36.934
HIS PROBLEM STARTED
THE DAY HE MET ME.

17:36.934 --> 17:38.834
YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU

17:38.834 --> 17:41.100
SINCE THE DAY
YOU MET ME.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.800
THE DAY HE MET ME.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.767
MET ME.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.900
HEY!

17:57.900 --> 17:58.900
WANT TO HAVE
LUNCH WITH ME?

17:58.900 --> 18:00.066
I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD.

18:00.066 --> 18:03.233
THOSE GUYS SAY
THAT YOU LIVE
IN A TRAILER PARK

18:03.233 --> 18:05.600
AND I SHOULDN'T
LIKE YOU.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
OH, WELL.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.967
IF YOU WANT
TO HAVE LUNCH
WITH ME,

18:07.967 --> 18:10.300
I'LL BE
RIGHT HERE.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.033
HEY, TOPANGA. LOOK,
I'M A LLAMA.

18:13.033 --> 18:16.100
LOOK, I'M A--
LA--LA--LLAMA--

18:16.100 --> 18:20.867
CORY, I TOLD YOU
NOT TO PLAY
BY THE LLAMAS.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.867
Young Cory:
HELP! HELP!

18:22.867 --> 18:24.600
SOMEBODY HELP.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.934
HELP!

18:25.934 --> 18:27.667
HELP!

18:35.734 --> 18:38.900
HEY, THANKS
FOR PULLING ME OUT
OF THE LLAMA PEN.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.000
IT WAS FUN.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
MY NAME'S CORY.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.033
I'M SHAWN.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.100
HI. I'M TOPANGA.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.300
THE WIFE.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.667
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T HAVE
LUNCH WITH YOU.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.100
MY FRIENDS
WERE WRONG.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.200
THEY'RE NOT
EVEN MY FRIENDS.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.567
I'LL BE YOUR FRIEND.

18:52.567 --> 18:53.567
REALLY?

18:53.567 --> 18:54.834
JUST PROMISE ME
WHEN WE GROW UP,

18:54.834 --> 18:57.300
YOU WON'T GO TO COLLEGE
AND LEAVE ME.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.000
OK.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.200
FRIENDS FOREVER?

19:00.200 --> 19:01.500
FOREVER.

19:02.734 --> 19:06.033
STOP IT.
YOU'RE BOYS.

19:08.233 --> 19:10.900
STOP IT.
YOU'RE BOYS.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.600
THANK YOU FOR PULLING ME
OUT OF THE LLAMA PEN.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.000
THANK YOU FOR HAVING
LUNCH WITH ME.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.233
OH, HERE WE GO.

19:18.233 --> 19:20.200
CORY,
I WANT YOU TO GO

19:20.200 --> 19:21.300
TO THE BEST COLLEGE
YOU CAN GET INTO.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.300
WE'LL BE
BEST FRIENDS
ALL OUR LIVES,

19:22.300 --> 19:25.000
NO MATTER
WHERE YOU GO.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.767
AND I SHOULD
HAVE BEEN MORE AWARE
OF YOUR INSECURITIES

19:26.767 --> 19:28.500
AND HOW SENSITIVE
YOU CAN BE.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.567
DO YOU THINK
I'M SENSITIVE?

19:30.567 --> 19:32.200
I DO.

19:33.233 --> 19:34.300
YOU KNOW WHAT, COR?

19:34.300 --> 19:35.734
I'M GOING TO WORK
REAL HARD.

19:35.734 --> 19:37.600
SO WHATEVER COLLEGE
YOU GET INTO,

19:37.600 --> 19:38.667
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE
WITH YOU.

19:38.667 --> 19:39.934
YOU MEAN IT?

19:39.934 --> 19:42.667
I'VE NEVER MEANT
ANYTHING MORE
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.967
OK, STOP IT!

19:44.967 --> 19:46.100
OK.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.300
WE STILL ALL
HAVE TO BE READY
FOR THE POSSIBILITY

19:47.300 --> 19:48.734
WE MAY END UP
IN DIFFERENT PLACES.

19:48.734 --> 19:51.500
AND THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR
SENIOR YEAR TOGETHER

19:51.500 --> 19:52.667
THE BEST YEAR
OF OUR LIVES.

19:52.667 --> 19:55.033
I MEAN, I APPLIED TO
THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI--

19:55.033 --> 19:57.467
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

19:57.467 --> 19:58.600
YOU'RE GOING TO MIAMI?

19:58.600 --> 20:00.233
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
I DID TELL YOU THAT.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.500
IF YOU DIDN'T LISTEN,
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.600
NO, TOPANGA,
YOU NEVER
MENTIONED ANYTHING--

20:03.600 --> 20:07.100
YOU TWO.
SIT DOWN.

20:13.133 --> 20:14.600
WELL, IT ALL
STARTED THE DAY

20:14.600 --> 20:16.600
SHE WAS NAGGING ME
BY THE LLAMA PIT.

20:16.600 --> 20:17.800
I DON'T NAG.
OW!

20:17.800 --> 20:20.233
THAT'S NOT TRUE--
GOSH, SHE SAID--

20:25.100 --> 20:26.100
HI, DEAN.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.934
IT'S ABOUT TIME...SIR.

20:27.934 --> 20:29.133
HOW DID YOU GET
IN HERE?

20:29.133 --> 20:32.500
IT'S AFTER HOURS.
THIS BUILDING IS LOCKED.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.400
YOU'RE TRESPASSING,
YOU KNOW THAT?

20:34.400 --> 20:37.367
YOU'RE VIOLATING
MY PERSONAL PROPERTY.

20:37.367 --> 20:41.300
I COULD HAVE YOU BOTH
SHOCK THERAPIED.

20:41.300 --> 20:44.400
LOOK, DEAN. WE REALLY
NEED THAT EXTENSION.

20:44.400 --> 20:48.100
IN MY ENTIRE 27-YEAR
DEAN CAREER

20:48.100 --> 20:52.100
WHICH SPANS 5 COLLEGES
ON 3 CONTINENTS,

20:52.100 --> 20:54.900
INCLUDING CHINA,

20:54.900 --> 21:01.300
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN ANY STUDENTS
AN EXTENSION.

21:05.667 --> 21:09.367
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
CAN YOU MAKE AN
EXCEPTION FOR US?

21:09.400 --> 21:12.100
CAN YOU MAKE AN
EXCEPTION FOR US?
MAYBE FOR A MONTH?

21:14.000 --> 21:18.133
[LAUGHS]

21:18.133 --> 21:20.700
OK, JUST BOUGHT US
A MONTH.

21:20.700 --> 21:23.000
YOU SPEAK
CHINESE?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.500
I DO.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.567
COOL.

21:25.567 --> 21:26.800
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S CELEBRATE.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.800
DEAN'S HOUSE?

21:27.800 --> 21:30.033
AND INSULT HIM
BY GOING ANYWHERE ELSE?
