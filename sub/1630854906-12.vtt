WEBVTT

00:01.544 --> 00:03.045
[explosions bursting
in distance]

00:03.629 --> 00:05.297
[speaking broken Arabic]
The stitches are holding,

00:05.381 --> 00:10.052
but you need to stay one
more day so we can rule out infection.

00:10.761 --> 00:11.804
[in English] Tomorrow.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.807
Sorry. What were you saying?

00:14.890 --> 00:17.268
We should talk about it later.
You should focus.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.352
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.855
I told you that I would be free and...
The hotel called?

00:20.938 --> 00:24.066
Yes, there's another couple
interested in the same cottage.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.776
Then we will find another hotel.

00:25.860 --> 00:26.861
Another hotel?

00:27.236 --> 00:29.864
Michael, you loved that place.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.824
I wouldn't say I loved it, but...

00:31.907 --> 00:33.951
You wouldn't stop talking
about how excited you were

00:34.034 --> 00:35.953
to spend your honeymoon
by the sea.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.414
You sounded like a 16-year-old.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.917
Michael, what is going on?

00:42.001 --> 00:43.878
You've been acting
strangely for weeks.

00:44.295 --> 00:47.089
The doctor who was supposed to
replace me, he backed out.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.049
I will fly in the week
before the wedding,

00:49.133 --> 00:51.594
but I need to come
right back here after.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.598
How much longer will you stay?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.767
Five, maybe six months.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.520
I know you're upset,
but once I'm back,

01:01.604 --> 01:03.355
we can go on our trip
another time and--

01:03.439 --> 01:06.025
-You think this is about a vacation?
-Ees...

01:06.108 --> 01:07.735
No, I am upset because
you promised

01:07.818 --> 01:10.112
you would not extend
your stay again.

01:10.446 --> 01:13.365
-There was nothing I could do!
-Oh, really?

01:13.616 --> 01:16.535
How many other doctors
did you call before you agreed, huh?

01:16.827 --> 01:19.455
Look, I know how important
your work is

01:19.538 --> 01:21.373
and I love how passionate
you are, but--

01:21.457 --> 01:23.125
[soldier yelling indistinctly
in distance]

01:23.334 --> 01:24.585
...if we're going to build
a life together, we...

01:24.668 --> 01:26.045
-Aissa, hang on.
-Dr. Abani?

01:26.128 --> 01:28.380
I don't know what you think
you're doing here,

01:28.464 --> 01:29.715
but Lieutenant... Lieutenant...

01:29.799 --> 01:30.883
Michael, what's going on?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.426
Get off. Take your hands off me.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.553
-I'm a doctor!
-Michael?

01:34.637 --> 01:36.263
-No. You're a terrorist.
-Michael?

01:36.347 --> 01:38.057
-No, no, no, no.
-Michael!

01:47.483 --> 01:51.110
Gatorade, tea, and lots of water.

01:51.237 --> 01:52.446
The theme of the day is...

01:52.530 --> 01:54.782
-Peeing?
-Staying hydrated.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.243
Mooms will be back
to make you lunch in a couple of hours.

01:57.326 --> 01:58.369
If you need anything--

01:58.452 --> 01:59.912
I call you, Mooms,

01:59.995 --> 02:01.872
or Mrs. Cartwright next door
if the house is on fire.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.249
I'm fine.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.001
What you are is warm.
I want you back in bed

02:06.085 --> 02:07.336
as soon as you're finished eating.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.838
And no TV.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.840
You know I can watch TV
on my phone, right?

02:11.423 --> 02:13.843
Well, don't.
Feel better, honeybun.

02:13.926 --> 02:17.054
[door opens and closes]

02:17.137 --> 02:18.639
[door opens]

02:20.474 --> 02:21.517
Agnes?

02:22.685 --> 02:24.061
-Pinky?
-[chuckles]

02:24.144 --> 02:27.231
What are you doing here?
You just missed Pops.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.899
I did? Oh, well.

02:28.983 --> 02:32.111
I heard you were feeling
a little under the weather,

02:32.194 --> 02:35.114
so I thought I'd come
and cheer you up.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.991
Pops has been looking for you,
you know.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.868
He seems pretty worried.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.829
That's just part of his constitution.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.247
But I'm here now,

02:44.039 --> 02:46.125
and I have everything we need

02:46.208 --> 02:48.002
for a quick recovery.

02:48.878 --> 02:51.213
Ice cream for a sore throat

02:51.297 --> 02:54.091
and movies to feed the soul.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.262
-[knocking on door]
-Yeah?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.180
-[door opens]
-Congressman.

03:00.264 --> 03:01.599
Uh-huh?

03:01.682 --> 03:03.392
[razor buzzing]

03:03.475 --> 03:06.186
Arthur, that's the third
all-nighter this month.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.771
-What is it this time?
-I'm not sure.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.317
I was reviewing the FBI's
discretionary spending budget last night.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.568
How exciting.

03:13.152 --> 03:15.321
[chuckles] Yeah.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.072
Right there.

03:17.156 --> 03:19.033
-Task Force 836.
-Mmm-hmm.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.284
The Bureau has dozens.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.744
The Bureau has dozens, officially.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.121
All formally authorized
and subject to oversight.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.999
But from what I could find,
Task Force 836

03:27.082 --> 03:29.668
only exists on this piece of paper.

03:29.752 --> 03:30.878
So it's classified.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.963
It's unacknowledged.

03:33.047 --> 03:36.050
The Bureau's spending millions
that they have to account for somehow.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.135
They assume nobody's looking
closely enough to find it.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.845
-They don't know you're...
-Thorough?

03:39.929 --> 03:41.138
Committed? Brilliant?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.141
And humble.
You thinking corruption?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.352
I don't know, but I want
to ask a few questions

03:46.435 --> 03:48.228
without spooking
Main Justice.

03:48.312 --> 03:51.398
Uh, Senator Panabaker's the ranking member
on Homeland Security, right?

03:51.482 --> 03:52.942
-Yeah.
-Call her office, please.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.027
I want the first five minutes
she has.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.196
No sign of Raymond
at the warehouse,

03:57.279 --> 03:59.156
but I set up surveillance devices

03:59.239 --> 04:01.075
covering the front and back.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.160
We should be able
to monitor it from here.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.747
Which means I'm glued
to the screens all weekend.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.792
Please tell me you're getting up
to something exciting at least.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.210
I am.

04:11.293 --> 04:14.171
The library finally received
the book I requested.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.130
Debt: The First 5,000 Years.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.843
I'm sorry. A book on debt?
That's your exciting weekend?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.928
[Siya] And I thought
my life was dull.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.722
-Anything on Reddington?
-[Dembe] Not yet.

04:23.806 --> 04:27.142
Too bad. I just got
off the phone with Cynthia.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.186
Apparently,
Congressman Arthur Hudson

04:29.269 --> 04:31.021
of the House Appropriations
Subcommittee

04:31.105 --> 04:33.148
on Homeland Security
has been asking questions

04:33.232 --> 04:36.902
about certain expenses
in the FBI's discretionary budget,

04:36.986 --> 04:39.113
expenses that point
to the existence of our task force.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.948
Is that a problem?

04:41.031 --> 04:43.742
Surely, you've dealt
with other government inquiries before.

04:43.826 --> 04:46.203
This task force
can only function if it remains a secret,

04:46.286 --> 04:47.746
even from government.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.540
In the past,
we've been able to keep our work quiet

04:49.623 --> 04:52.376
by delivering high-profile
cases, but recently--

04:52.459 --> 04:53.711
We've got nothing.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.838
Unfortunately, yes.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.382
I'm afraid we can't keep waiting for him
to make contact.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.300
Malik, head up to New York

05:00.384 --> 05:02.011
and put eyes
on Reddington's bathhouse.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.679
If you find him,
let him know

05:03.762 --> 05:06.056
we're gonna need
a new case, and fast.

05:06.140 --> 05:09.101
Meanwhile, I've, uh, set up a meeting
with an old friend who worked with Hudson

05:09.184 --> 05:11.311
-at the US Attorney's Office in Chicago.
-[cellphone buzzes]

05:11.395 --> 05:13.772
Hopefully, he can
give us a sense of who we're dealing with.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.819
You all right?
You look like you saw a ghost.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.530
-I have to go.
-You want some company?

05:21.613 --> 05:23.741
I mean, the last time
you ran out of here like this,

05:23.824 --> 05:26.285
you got shot, captured,
and tortured.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.871
All right, suit yourself,
but I don't hear from you

05:28.954 --> 05:30.914
every half-hour,
I'm calling SWAT.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.878
[man singing in French]

05:36.128 --> 05:38.422
[people chattering indistinctly]

05:42.718 --> 05:44.344
[door closes]

05:46.680 --> 05:48.265
[speaking French]
A glass of Burgundy, please.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.769
[in English] No.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.730
[in French] Excuse me?

05:56.899 --> 05:58.025
You heard me.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.402
[glass clinks]

06:00.486 --> 06:02.780
Twice a week,
you sit at this bar,

06:02.863 --> 06:06.158
you order a glass of wine
that you do not touch,

06:06.241 --> 06:07.951
and you stare
at your book.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.245
I'm tired of seeing
good wine go to waste.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.624
So,

06:13.707 --> 06:17.878
either you ask
for my number, or leave.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.964
What makes you think
I want your number?

06:21.048 --> 06:24.093
Maybe the sound of the bar
helps me focus,

06:24.176 --> 06:25.886
and I order a glass of wine

06:25.969 --> 06:29.556
because I don't drink...
but don't wish to be rude.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.477
It's possible.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.648
But no.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.069
No, I think you are scared.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.655
Scared? Of you?

07:05.384 --> 07:06.718
I guess we'll have to see.

07:06.802 --> 07:07.928
[door closes]

07:08.011 --> 07:09.388
I'm Aissa.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.183
Dembe.

07:16.812 --> 07:17.813
I'll call you.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.231
You better.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.486
[knocking on door]

07:29.366 --> 07:30.576
Aissa.

07:32.536 --> 07:33.871
Come in.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.457
Is everything okay with Isabella?

07:38.542 --> 07:41.253
She and your granddaughter,
they are...

07:41.336 --> 07:43.338
They... They are fine.

07:43.422 --> 07:46.216
I didn't want to bother you,
but I didn't know what else to do.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.551
It's about Michael.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.428
Your boyfriend.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.556
Fiance.
We got engaged last May.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.183
I thought
Isabella told you.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.393
No. She must have forgotten.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.228
Congratulations.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.648
So, what happened
with Michael?

08:01.732 --> 08:04.818
Two days ago,
he was abducted from his medical clinic

08:04.902 --> 08:06.987
outside Taiz by Yemeni soldiers.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.740
I called the State Department,
our Congressman.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.533
I even tried
the Nigerian embassy.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.493
Because Michael is just
a green card holder here,

08:13.577 --> 08:15.746
and no one can tell me anything.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.750
I thought maybe with
your contacts in the FBI,

08:19.832 --> 08:22.377
you might be able to find out
what is happening.

08:22.461 --> 08:25.088
I'm so sorry, Aissa. I'll...

08:25.172 --> 08:27.341
I'll find out everything I can.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.219
Wait here.
And I'll make some calls.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.554
Dembe. Thank you.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.143
I wouldn't have blamed you
if you hadn't come.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.520
[exhales sharply]

08:40.604 --> 08:42.397
I'll... I'll be right back.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.111
So, uh, how's she look?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.614
-[Dembe] Fine.
-What do you mean "fine"?

08:50.697 --> 08:52.407
You see your ex,
Isabella's mother,

08:52.491 --> 08:55.035
the woman you never speak about,
and all you can say is "fine"?

08:55.118 --> 08:57.996
Have you heard back
from your contact at Hostage Affairs?

08:58.080 --> 08:59.873
No. She's sending me
an update any minute.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.291
Are you with her now?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.126
No. I'm in the hallway.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.962
Ha. So you're hiding from her.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.547
I'm making a call
to a secure FBI facility.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.966
I'm not hiding from her.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.927
Whatever you say.
Oh, man.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.011
-[keyboard clacking]
-What is it?

09:13.095 --> 09:14.137
This is bad news.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.306
Michael's being held
at a military prison.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.767
The Yemenis say
that he was redirecting humanitarian aid

09:18.850 --> 09:21.853
away from his clinic toward
a group of Houthi rebels.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.605
They're claiming he's a terrorist.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.148
Do they have evidence?

09:25.315 --> 09:27.442
No, State's trying
to figure that out now.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.028
Look. There's something else.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.660
[sighs]

09:36.743 --> 09:38.954
What is it?
What happened?

09:39.830 --> 09:43.208
Michael was immediately tried
by a military tribunal.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.920
They're planning to execute him
in 72 hours.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.179
What about a rescue operation?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.597
It's unlikely.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.933
The US military doesn't have
many assets on the ground,

10:00.017 --> 10:02.519
and since Michael isn't a US citizen--

10:02.602 --> 10:04.855
The government won't risk it.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.648
What about people from your world?

10:06.732 --> 10:10.944
I'm not in that world anymore.
But I still have friends, contacts.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.321
You mean Raymond.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.865
We haven't been able
to get ahold of him recently.

10:15.198 --> 10:19.036
If I can, he'll need to know
who the local players are.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.039
Michael's NGO wasn't running a clinic
without the cooperation

10:22.122 --> 10:24.041
from both the rebels
and the government.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.002
We need to know who Michael would have
been in contact with on the ground.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.755
You should talk to Jon.
Jon Rapchinski.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.632
He is the executive director
of Michael's NGO.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.843
He just got back from Yemen
a few months ago.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.970
I'll go see him now.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.057
Do you think Michael
may have been involved in the smuggling?

10:40.682 --> 10:43.643
I only ask because it will affect
who we might approach and how.

10:45.812 --> 10:49.775
Michael would never take
anything from his patients. I know him.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.069
We all keep secrets, Aissa.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.614
Not Michael. Not from me.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.371
For a while, I was waiting tables,

11:02.454 --> 11:04.456
and then I started
to train as a sommelier.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.832
No wasted wine.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.417
It's a sin.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.837
After my father died,
my mother wanted me

11:10.921 --> 11:13.799
to come back with her to Cameroon,

11:13.882 --> 11:16.343
but I stayed
to finish my degree.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.387
Public health.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.806
And you're a chef, as well.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.016
This is
the most delicious thing I've ever had.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.437
Can you cook?

11:28.980 --> 11:31.733
If you're lucky, I'll teach you.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.860
I'd like that.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.743
So, how does a university student

11:41.827 --> 11:43.578
afford designer clothing?

11:44.413 --> 11:46.540
They were a gift, from a friend.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.542
Does this friend have a name?

11:48.625 --> 11:50.585
His name is Raymond.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.213
We became close back in Kenya.

11:53.296 --> 11:56.341
He offered me the chance
to pursue my education.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.927
It's like that, um, Dickens novel.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.637
Great Expectations.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.972
Literature student?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.599
Economics. And history.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.018
But I like to read.

12:07.102 --> 12:11.731
And, uh, what kind of work
does this Raymond do exactly?

12:12.149 --> 12:13.525
International trade.

12:13.608 --> 12:17.404
A little broad for a student
of economics and history, no?

12:23.160 --> 12:24.536
You're deflecting.

12:27.539 --> 12:28.540
Is it working?

12:32.335 --> 12:33.336
Ah...

12:33.420 --> 12:34.838
[laughs]

12:34.921 --> 12:37.090
You don't have to
tell me everything,

12:37.174 --> 12:39.759
but you must never lie to me.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.637
[speaking French]
Do you understand me?

12:45.182 --> 12:46.933
[Ressler echoing] Dembe?

12:47.017 --> 12:49.102
[in English] Hey. Dembe!

12:50.061 --> 12:52.647
The CIA confirmed chatter
about a US-based asset

12:52.731 --> 12:54.816
operating in the region
starting last spring.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.819
Right after Michael arrived in Yemen.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.571
-Thank you for your help.
-Of course.

12:59.654 --> 13:04.117
If the government's hands are tied
because of his citizenship status,

13:04.201 --> 13:06.703
we're the only chance
he has.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.289
If you're feeling grateful,
uh, why don't you tell me

13:09.372 --> 13:11.458
about how you and Aissa met, then?

13:13.627 --> 13:14.711
We met in Marseille.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.088
I was in university,

13:17.172 --> 13:20.091
and I had just begun
working with Raymond.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.760
I was young and curious
and learning,

13:21.843 --> 13:25.805
and she was the most
amazing woman I ever met.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.976
And then it ended.

13:34.606 --> 13:38.318
No. No. That's... That's impossible.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.570
[stammers]
Michael worked his tail off

13:40.654 --> 13:42.447
to get those supplies
to begin with.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.950
He... He would never
just give them away.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.952
But he did oversee
your supply procurement,

13:47.035 --> 13:48.828
so, I mean, theoretically,
it is possible

13:48.912 --> 13:50.455
he could have been
rerouting supplies,

13:50.539 --> 13:52.165
and you never
would have known.

13:52.249 --> 13:56.169
It's a small clinic,
so everyone wears multiple hats.

13:56.253 --> 14:00.048
Michael always found a way
to get whatever we needed.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.216
At least, until...

14:01.800 --> 14:03.510
Until what?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.179
Well, last year, uh,

14:06.263 --> 14:09.516
some soldiers
dragged three kids out of the clinic.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.602
The soldiers suspected the boys
of scouting for the Houthi rebels

14:12.686 --> 14:15.438
and shot them out in the street.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.607
Michael took it very hard.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.819
He started arguing
with the staff, with Aissa.

14:20.902 --> 14:23.280
I told him to go home,
clear his head, just...

14:23.363 --> 14:24.906
But he wouldn't hear of it.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.367
Who was your contact
in the Yemeni military?

14:27.450 --> 14:29.244
Uh, Lieutenant Abdul Hassan.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.912
I've never met him myself.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.998
If I ever needed something,
I'd always go through Michael.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.542
So if Dr. Abani wanted
to contact the Houthis,

14:35.625 --> 14:37.627
who do you think
he would have turned to?

14:37.711 --> 14:40.589
Uh, there was a man.
Uh, Abu Saleh.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.633
You know, the staff said that
he worked with the rebels.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.720
But Michael is a good man
and an even better physician.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.264
If there is anything
that we can do to help...

14:49.347 --> 14:54.269
I mean, a bribe, lawyers, supplies,
whatever it is, we will do it.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.271
Thank you for your time,
Dr. Rapchinski.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.106
-We'll be in touch.
-Thank you.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.483
I've tried many varieties

15:00.567 --> 15:03.570
of mint chip
through the years,

15:03.653 --> 15:07.365
and the really green stuff
is never the best.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.409
Maybe it's the food coloring.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.578
Huh! Hmm.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.413
How come you always
come over here

15:13.496 --> 15:15.540
and I never go
to your house?

15:16.166 --> 15:17.834
I don't really have a house.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.211
-Not anymore, at least.
-[Agnes] What happened?

15:20.295 --> 15:23.965
[Reddington] Well,
I sold one, gifted four.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.593
I sunk numbers six and seven.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.304
And eight and nine...

15:29.679 --> 15:32.057
I'm not entirely sure
what's happened to them.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.768
[Agnes] How come you got rid
of all your houses?

15:34.851 --> 15:36.645
[Reddington] I suppose...

15:36.728 --> 15:39.814
Well, recently,
I've found myself

15:40.607 --> 15:42.734
letting go more and more

15:43.234 --> 15:48.531
so I can better
hold onto what I really want

15:48.615 --> 15:50.784
and still be light on my feet.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.411
[cell phone buzzing]

15:53.495 --> 15:54.704
Mmm.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.626
Ah.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.754
Agnes, why don't you queue up
one of the movies?

16:02.837 --> 16:06.216
I'll put this stuff away and be right in.

16:10.595 --> 16:11.971
[beeps]

16:12.055 --> 16:13.598
Yes? What is it?

16:13.682 --> 16:15.558
[Giorgio] I know you didn't
want to be interrupted,

16:15.642 --> 16:19.562
but there was a signal
at 7th and Wharf.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.065
Obrigado, Giorgio. Ciao.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.274
[cell phone beeps]

16:23.358 --> 16:25.193
[cell phone rings]

16:25.276 --> 16:26.945
Raymond.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.614
I wasn't sure you still had
the location being watched.

16:29.698 --> 16:32.325
I am. For emergencies only.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.452
If Harold put you
up to this, Dembe--

16:34.536 --> 16:35.704
It's Aissa.

16:35.829 --> 16:39.999
Aissa. My, my. Tell me.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.254
[beeping]

16:44.337 --> 16:46.172
[keyboard clacking]

16:48.007 --> 16:51.594
I see. So you want me
to help you save the man

16:51.678 --> 16:55.056
set to marry
the woman you loved?

16:55.140 --> 16:59.519
That sounds like
a number of emergencies rolled into one.

16:59.602 --> 17:03.773
He's believed to be working with a Yemeni
commander, Lieutenant Abdul Hassan,

17:03.857 --> 17:07.234
and a Houthi operative
named Fadl Abu Saleh.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.988
-I don't know either one.
-Neither do I.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.198
Not that it would matter much
if I did.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.617
That Lieutenant's
superior's superior

17:14.701 --> 17:18.121
is locked in an intractable
conflict between some of

17:18.204 --> 17:21.165
the most badly behaved players
in the Near East.

17:21.249 --> 17:25.712
Getting one man out of that nightmare
couldn't be more complicated.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.756
But I'll see what
I can find out.

17:27.839 --> 17:28.965
Thank you, Raymond.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.800
Dembe...

17:30.884 --> 17:33.470
That night in Marseille...

17:33.553 --> 17:34.554
It's in the past.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.891
[keyboard clacks]

17:37.974 --> 17:39.309
[printer whirring]

17:41.269 --> 17:43.730
I'll reach out when I have anything,

17:43.813 --> 17:45.690
but in the meantime, Dembe,

17:45.774 --> 17:49.444
you might consider
that the past and the present

17:49.527 --> 17:54.073
aren't as neatly divided
as we'd like to believe.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.743
Take a look at this.
It's a statement for an account

17:56.826 --> 17:58.870
in Michael's name
at a bank in Istanbul.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.539
[Dembe] These deposits...

18:01.623 --> 18:04.042
Over $200,000
in the last six months.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.836
Now, Michael wasn't providing
supplies to the Houthis

18:06.920 --> 18:09.214
out of humanitarian concern.
He was doing it to get rich.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.632
[cellphone ringing]

18:10.715 --> 18:14.803
If that's true, the State Department
will never negotiate his release.

18:14.886 --> 18:17.305
The Yemenis
will execute him for sure.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.431
You have to tell her.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.891
[cell phone ringing]

18:21.100 --> 18:23.603
-I can't.
-Why not?

18:23.686 --> 18:26.481
Because I lied to her once before,
and it broke her heart.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.108
I don't know if I can
watch that happen again.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.448
[speaking French]
It was painfully boring!

18:36.616 --> 18:38.910
It was brilliant.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.829
Kieslowski is a genius.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.455
It's the same woman.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.749
One in France, one in Poland,

18:45.124 --> 18:47.919
both dull.
You want brilliant.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.337
Point Break.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.548
That was brilliant.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.968
[in English]
Will you come by tonight?

18:55.051 --> 18:58.513
There is something I need
to talk to you about.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.224
[speaking French]
How mysterious.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.768
[in English]
You're one to talk.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.771
What is it?

19:06.855 --> 19:09.649
I promised a friend
I would help him study

19:09.732 --> 19:11.484
for an exam this evening.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.278
So come by after we close.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.988
I'll make your omelet.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.448
You always bite your lip
when you're nervous.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.284
-I... I...
-Is there someone else?

19:19.367 --> 19:20.493
[Dembe] What? No!

19:20.577 --> 19:22.120
[speaking French] It's that blonde
from the cinema, isn't it?

19:22.203 --> 19:23.204
I love you.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.252
Aissa.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.922
[in English]
I love you, too.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.637
No. There's no time.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.639
I have to open the cafe.

19:46.978 --> 19:47.979
Go!

19:50.607 --> 19:52.025
See you tonight.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.531
For the last eight months,
money has been flowing

19:58.615 --> 20:00.575
into Michael's account
from shell companies

20:00.658 --> 20:04.203
associated with the Iranian proxies
supporting the Houthi rebels.

20:05.121 --> 20:08.041
You think he really did this?

20:08.124 --> 20:10.043
You think he was
supporting terrorism?

20:10.126 --> 20:13.963
It appears so.
But there may be a silver lining.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.050
If the task force can uncover
the entire smuggling network

20:17.133 --> 20:19.052
that Michael was working with,

20:19.135 --> 20:21.721
it may be possible
we can convince the Yemenis

20:21.804 --> 20:23.973
to extradite Michael back to the US.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.643
I'm sorry, Aissa.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.818
Have you eaten? Sit down.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.946
I'll make you something.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.447
I should go.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.282
I said sit down.

20:42.116 --> 20:46.037
I just found out my fiance
may be a liar helping terrorists,

20:46.120 --> 20:48.122
so you're going to sit there
while I make you some lunch

20:48.206 --> 20:50.124
because if I don't do
something with my hands,

20:50.208 --> 20:52.293
I am going to scream.
Is that what you want?

20:52.377 --> 20:54.045
-No.
-Then sit.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.632
When I'm done, we're going
to go through those papers

20:57.715 --> 21:00.927
until I convince you
that Michael is innocent.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.721
-I'm not asking. Sit.
-[whisking]

21:05.723 --> 21:07.767
I gotta say,
Harold, when you said you wanted to meet,

21:07.850 --> 21:10.269
I thought we would
talk about life in the private sector,

21:10.353 --> 21:12.397
not Arthur Hudson.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.023
Clearly, he made an impression.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.775
How long did you two
work together

21:15.858 --> 21:16.901
at the U.S. Attorney's Office?

21:16.985 --> 21:18.945
Four years.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.655
Most AUSAs
take a little while

21:20.738 --> 21:22.865
to get their feet
underneath them.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.909
Not Arthur.

21:24.993 --> 21:28.246
Political corruption cases
can be a nightmare for prosecutors.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.248
They were Hudson's
bread and butter.

21:30.331 --> 21:33.751
Built his whole Congressional
campaign around it.

21:33.835 --> 21:36.379
I'm telling ya,
nobody can see a story

21:36.462 --> 21:39.424
around a few sticky numbers
like Arthur Hudson can.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.634
So he's tough, smart,
and ambitious?

21:41.718 --> 21:44.470
Almost makes me feel sorry
for Congress.

21:44.971 --> 21:45.972
Almost.

21:48.266 --> 21:49.934
You sure everything's
all right, Harold?

21:50.018 --> 21:53.271
Fine. Yeah.
Just a few questions about an old case.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.898
Thanks for your time, Ronnie.
My best to Bea.

21:55.982 --> 22:00.236
Harold, if, uh, Arthur Hudson
is digging around for something,

22:00.319 --> 22:01.946
I'd just assume that
he's gonna find it,

22:02.030 --> 22:05.366
and when he does,
he'll let the whole world know.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.243
You understand?

22:12.373 --> 22:16.919
Mmm. That was even better
than I remembered.

22:17.295 --> 22:18.838
It's Michael's favorite, too.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.298
It's how I get all my men.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.551
When was the last time
you two saw each other?

22:24.427 --> 22:26.596
End of October.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.432
We spent a week
by the beach in Cyprus.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.684
[chuckles]

22:31.768 --> 22:32.977
What?

22:33.061 --> 22:34.520
[cell phone dings]

22:34.604 --> 22:37.899
I just never imagined you
sitting on a beach.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.234
Ah, Isabella is
coming down with Ella.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.487
I told her not to bother,
but she insisted.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.863
She'll be here soon.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.240
Well, she's just as stubborn
as her mother.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.076
[chuckles]

22:48.159 --> 22:51.037
You know, I really was happy
to hear you two were talking again.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.372
You raised a wonderful
daughter, you know.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.666
I didn't do it alone.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.877
Even with everything
you were going through,

22:57.960 --> 22:59.545
she always had you in her life.

22:59.629 --> 23:01.464
I wish I could have
been there more.

23:04.300 --> 23:08.304
Thank you for staying.
You know, you didn't have to.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.473
Of course I did.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.684
Ever since I met you,
I've never been able to say no to you.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.103
Surely you know that
by now.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.276
You know, I was...

23:22.360 --> 23:25.113
I was nervous to see you.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.615
I was afraid you might
think I looked--

23:27.698 --> 23:28.908
Old?

23:28.991 --> 23:30.827
[laughs]

23:30.910 --> 23:32.954
I was afraid of the same.

23:35.498 --> 23:36.582
Well, you don't.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.419
"Oh, gosh, Aissa, you don't look--"

23:40.503 --> 23:42.880
When was the last time
you two were in Cyprus?

23:42.964 --> 23:44.298
End of October. Why?

23:44.382 --> 23:46.759
You were in Cyprus together
on October 28th?

23:46.843 --> 23:50.096
-You are sure?
-Yes. Why?

23:51.556 --> 23:52.974
According to this statement,

23:53.057 --> 23:55.685
Michael made a withdrawal
from a bank in Istanbul

23:55.768 --> 23:57.228
that day in person.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.230
Someone else has access
to Michael's account.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.358
The Yemenis are
about to execute him

24:02.441 --> 24:05.027
for a crime he didn't commit.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.082
[blows]

24:23.254 --> 24:24.463
-Dembe.
-Aissa.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.382
I'm sorry, but we need
to leave the city, tonight.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.800
-Why?
-There's a plane waiting

24:27.884 --> 24:29.719
outside an airstrip outside Cabries.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.596
It leaves in exactly 36 minutes.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.598
I will tell you everything
you want to know once we're there,

24:33.681 --> 24:35.892
-but we need to leave now.
-We?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.311
I am not going anywhere
until you--

24:38.394 --> 24:40.104
[sirens passing by]

24:42.857 --> 24:44.275
You weren't helping
a friend study.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.110
-You were with him.
-Aissa--

24:46.194 --> 24:49.322
He's not just a businessman,
this Raymond.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.698
He's a criminal.

24:50.781 --> 24:53.534
And... And what?
You work for him?

24:53.618 --> 24:54.952
It's complicated.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.412
Then un-complicate it!

24:56.495 --> 24:58.664
Raymond saved my life
back in Nairobi.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.374
Tonight, I saved his.

25:00.458 --> 25:01.834
You have to understand,

25:01.918 --> 25:04.754
he was the most
important person to me,

25:04.837 --> 25:06.255
until I met you.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.341
You lied to me.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.550
For him.

25:09.634 --> 25:11.010
Yes.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.970
I did, and I'm sorry.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.348
I promise I will tell you
everything you want to know,

25:15.431 --> 25:17.558
but we need to leave, now.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.563
Please.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.535
[door closes]

25:44.001 --> 25:45.586
[sobs]

25:49.507 --> 25:51.467
[Dembe] The State Department
is sharing what we learned

25:51.550 --> 25:53.052
with the Yemenis now.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.888
Hopefully, it will
convince them to stay the execution.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.890
Hopefully? He didn't do it.

25:57.974 --> 26:00.601
I know, and I hope
the Yemenis will agree,

26:00.685 --> 26:03.104
but until we find out who was
really running that account,

26:03.187 --> 26:04.730
we can't be sure.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.733
And even then,
there's no guarantee.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.778
I should go.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.197
Dembe.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.366
I know it must not
have been easy for you,

26:15.449 --> 26:17.785
leaving Raymond, joining the FBI.

26:18.119 --> 26:21.706
I always knew you could do
something amazing with your life.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.625
I'm proud of you.

26:26.877 --> 26:29.547
I'm glad I was wrong
about Michael.

26:30.548 --> 26:33.467
I'll let you know when
we have something. Wait here.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.386
Okay.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.642
Yemenis aren't budging.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.269
They claim our evidence
only proves

26:43.352 --> 26:45.062
Michael had an accomplice,
not that he's innocent.

26:45.146 --> 26:47.440
They're still planning
to move forward with the execution.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.817
Maybe not. I just pulled
the travel records for everyone

26:49.900 --> 26:52.903
who had access
to the supply chain within the NGO.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.614
A Jon Rapchinski flew
into Istanbul two days

26:55.698 --> 26:57.908
before Michael's
last alleged withdrawal,

26:57.992 --> 26:59.243
and the time before that.

26:59.327 --> 27:01.495
The Yemenis will say
it's a coincidence.

27:01.579 --> 27:03.456
Well, maybe, but get this,

27:03.539 --> 27:06.459
two hours after we met with him,
he booked a flight to Lebanon.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.835
He leaves tonight.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.545
Find Rapchinski. Now.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.922
You'll have a warrant
by the time you arrive.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.175
Okay, okay. Slow down, slow down.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.178
Someone at your NGO
set him up, Jon.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.805
Who else in the organization
had access to your supply chains?

27:19.889 --> 27:22.183
I'm not sure.
T-There's half a dozen organizations

27:22.266 --> 27:23.976
who send us supplies.

27:24.060 --> 27:26.645
Uh, um, aid workers
on the ground, local volunteers.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.606
[Aissa] Hello.
This is Aissa Joachim.

27:28.689 --> 27:30.316
I can't come to the phone
right now, but...

27:30.399 --> 27:31.901
Who else had enough
information to set up

27:31.984 --> 27:34.236
an account using Michael's name?

27:34.320 --> 27:37.365
Aissa, it's me.
Call me as soon as you get this.

27:37.448 --> 27:39.492
I thought you told her
to wait for your call.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.035
I did.

27:41.118 --> 27:43.037
Maybe someone
who had access to our computer system.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.206
Someone who had access
who is in the country, yes?

27:45.289 --> 27:47.291
That can't be more than
a handful of people.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.085
-Jon!
-Yes. Right.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.711
I'll call Fatima
and get a list of those names.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.797
Okay, okay. Good. Good.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.423
Okay. Good.

27:59.512 --> 28:00.930
Uh...

28:01.639 --> 28:04.600
[siren wailing]

28:04.683 --> 28:06.102
Isabella, where are you?

28:06.185 --> 28:08.646
Dad, hey.
Ella and I just got to Mom's place.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.815
-Is your mother there?
-I don't think so.

28:10.898 --> 28:13.859
Wait. Did Mom cook for you?

28:13.943 --> 28:15.611
Isabella, listen to me.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.364
Did your mother say
anything to you about where she might be?

28:18.447 --> 28:21.659
No. Dad, you're freaking me out.
What is going on?

28:21.742 --> 28:23.494
-Mom. Look.
-What is it?

28:23.577 --> 28:25.204
Mom left a note.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.623
It says she want to talk
to Jon Rap-something.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.042
-Rapchinski.
-Dad, what is happening?

28:30.126 --> 28:31.961
Does the note say
what time she left?

28:32.044 --> 28:34.713
-No. Dad, talk to me.
-Your mother's in trouble.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.590
-I'll call you back as soon as I can.
-Dad--

28:37.049 --> 28:40.261
I think I may have left
my phone in the car.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.807
[stammers] I'm so sorry.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.767
-Jon--
-I never wanted this to happen.

28:46.851 --> 28:47.852
Jon, I ju--

28:47.935 --> 28:49.645
They promised me
that no one would ever find out.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.105
You have to understand,

28:51.188 --> 28:53.232
I thought I was doing
what was best for everyone.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.733
I thought
if I agreed to help,

28:54.817 --> 28:57.778
we'd get more supplies
for the clinic, right?

28:57.862 --> 29:00.239
And if that meant sending
support to the rebels, so be it.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.866
-Oh!
-I...

29:01.949 --> 29:04.285
I risked my life helping
those people every day!

29:04.368 --> 29:05.995
I paid bribes to the government,

29:06.078 --> 29:07.746
the Houthis, everyone,
out of my own pocket.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.623
Why shouldn't I get a little
of that money back?

29:09.707 --> 29:11.041
I-If Michael had been in my position,

29:11.125 --> 29:12.376
he would have done
the same thing.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.879
Nuh-uh! He didn't
do this, Jon! You did!

29:19.383 --> 29:20.593
For the life of me,
I don't understand

29:20.676 --> 29:22.511
why you would drag
Michael's name into this!

29:22.595 --> 29:25.097
I never meant to involve him.
I really didn't.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.515
I just...
I showed up to the bank.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.142
I-I couldn't believe
what I was doing.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.311
I was scared,
so I-I gave them Michael's name.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.188
I never thought that
he would get hurt.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.648
Okay. I believe you, Jon. I do.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.317
But Michael is in trouble!

29:36.400 --> 29:37.568
They are going to kill him

29:37.651 --> 29:39.445
unless you and I go to
the authorities right now!

29:39.695 --> 29:42.114
The Yemenis are never
going to give him up, even if I confess.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.741
You don't know that!

29:43.824 --> 29:46.785
I know he's your friend, Jon,
and I know that you care about him.

29:46.869 --> 29:49.288
All you have to do
is tell the truth

29:49.371 --> 29:52.166
about what really happened,
and we can save his life!

29:52.249 --> 29:53.375
It's not too late!

29:53.459 --> 29:55.169
I can't! I can't, okay?

29:55.252 --> 29:57.588
Why did you come here?
You shouldn't have come here!

29:57.671 --> 29:59.256
[Aissa screams]

30:03.719 --> 30:05.304
[siren wails]

30:12.228 --> 30:13.437
[Aissa screams]

30:20.819 --> 30:22.821
[Aissa gagging]

30:30.371 --> 30:32.373
[siren wails]

30:38.462 --> 30:39.838
[Dembe] Aissa!

30:46.554 --> 30:49.139
I was afraid that I...

30:49.223 --> 30:50.808
Are you okay?

30:52.393 --> 30:55.020
House is clear.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.273
-You all right?
-Yes, I-I'm fine.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.774
What happened? Where's Jon?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.609
Well, since you two
were taking your sweet time,

31:00.693 --> 31:03.612
I got some help.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.239
From a friend.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.662
-General Thabit. A friend of Al-Ashabi's.
-[Thabit speaking Arabic]

31:11.745 --> 31:13.956
I watched him lose
quite a bit of money

31:14.039 --> 31:15.583
at a table in Lebanon
years ago.

31:15.666 --> 31:19.295
-[Thabit] Reddington?
-Oh! He mentioned me.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.380
Tell me, how did you
get my number?

31:21.463 --> 31:23.966
At the moment, Tamer,
how I got your number

31:24.049 --> 31:26.343
matters less than what
I'm prepared to do for you.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.012
From what I hear,
you're feeding

31:28.095 --> 31:31.140
and supplying
three regiments of infantry.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.393
The total cost to you
and your Saudi backers

31:34.476 --> 31:38.063
is just over $2 million US
per month.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.441
I'm prepared to cut
those costs in half.

31:40.524 --> 31:43.902
All I ask in exchange
is that you see to it

31:43.986 --> 31:46.864
that Dr. Michael Abani is released

31:46.947 --> 31:49.283
from your prison outside of Taiz.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.870
Your offer is generous,
but I cannot simply allow

31:52.953 --> 31:54.997
a convicted terrorist to go free.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.250
Of course not,
which is why I propose a trade.

31:58.334 --> 32:00.711
We both know Dr. Abani is innocent.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.546
Turn him over to the Americans,

32:02.630 --> 32:07.426
and I'll deliver the man
who was in fact supplying your enemies.

32:07.509 --> 32:10.304
You can tell Prince whomever

32:10.387 --> 32:13.349
that you're saving him
over $11 million a year,

32:13.432 --> 32:16.143
or you can treat your men,
your mistress,

32:16.226 --> 32:18.854
or yourself to just about
whatever you please.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.774
So, General,
what do you say?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.445
[man speaking French]
You know, I'm going to miss you.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.906
Oh please,
you won't even notice I'm gone.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.618
Excuse me.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.495
[door closes]

32:41.877 --> 32:43.379
What can I get you?

32:44.213 --> 32:45.714
A glass of Burgundy, please.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.970
-Aissa--
-[in English] You're alive.

32:52.054 --> 32:54.306
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.100
[door opens]

32:56.183 --> 32:57.976
[gasps] Ah!

32:58.852 --> 33:00.354
[speaking French] My love!

33:00.979 --> 33:03.565
Oh! Hello.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.527
Thank you, see you later!

33:08.278 --> 33:09.571
Oh.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.657
How are you my love?

33:11.740 --> 33:13.242
Dembe.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.202
[in English] There's someone
I think you should meet.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.207
This is Isabella, your daughter.

33:21.125 --> 33:22.459
What?

33:22.543 --> 33:23.877
Your daughter.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.464
She just turned 14 months.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.634
She's perfect.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.223
The night you left,
I was going to tell you about her.

33:38.058 --> 33:40.561
I swear, if I had known...

33:41.687 --> 33:43.147
I'm so sorry.

33:45.190 --> 33:48.193
I'm so sorry I haven't been here,
but I'm here now.

33:48.277 --> 33:51.029
Dembe. We won't be.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.574
We are leaving.

33:53.782 --> 33:56.452
I got a research position
in America.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.620
We're moving at the end
of the month.

33:58.704 --> 33:59.913
I'll go with you.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.585
I appreciate the offer.

34:04.668 --> 34:07.629
I do, but...

34:08.297 --> 34:12.009
That man,
the policeman at the bar,

34:12.092 --> 34:14.136
no one else would know
what he does for a living,

34:14.219 --> 34:17.264
but you knew the second
you walked in, didn't you?

34:18.223 --> 34:20.141
And if you came with us,

34:20.225 --> 34:23.103
you'd always be looking over
your shoulder like that,

34:23.353 --> 34:24.646
wouldn't you?

34:27.690 --> 34:28.984
Yes.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.362
And if someone did see you,
then what?

34:32.446 --> 34:34.739
Bags packed in the middle
of the night?

34:34.822 --> 34:37.326
On to a new city, with new names?

34:37.493 --> 34:39.870
I love you, Dembe. I do.

34:39.953 --> 34:43.623
But that's not the life I want,

34:43.706 --> 34:45.583
for either of us.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.965
I won't bother you again.

34:57.346 --> 34:58.931
Do you want to hold her?

34:59.932 --> 35:00.933
Yes.

35:02.893 --> 35:04.561
Very much, but...

35:04.645 --> 35:06.563
I should go.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.959
[cell phone rings]

35:29.711 --> 35:30.796
Raymond.

35:30.879 --> 35:35.217
Dr. Abani was just delivered
to the Red Crescent hospital in Sana'a.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.846
He has a few cracked ribs
and a bump the size of a plum

35:38.929 --> 35:41.431
on the back of his head,
but he should be fine.

35:41.515 --> 35:43.016
What about Dr. Rapchinski?

35:43.100 --> 35:45.769
Oh, he's on a Saudi transport
out of Lisbon.

35:45.853 --> 35:47.646
He'll be in Riyan by morning.

35:47.729 --> 35:50.440
General Thabit assured me
the Yemenis wouldn't

35:50.524 --> 35:53.569
seek the death penalty,
provided the good doctor

35:53.652 --> 35:55.529
gives up his Iranian collaborators,

35:55.612 --> 35:59.032
which I imagine
he's eagerly doing as we speak.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.578
Raymond, if you hadn't
shown up in time--

36:03.036 --> 36:04.621
You're still in love with her.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.001
I think I always have been.

36:12.713 --> 36:14.840
Raymond, you need to speak to Harold.

36:14.923 --> 36:17.217
There's a congressman
investigating the task force and--

36:17.301 --> 36:20.304
I would have understood, if...

36:20.387 --> 36:23.849
If you hadn't shown up
that night at the airfield.

36:24.266 --> 36:25.601
I know.

36:26.476 --> 36:27.644
I knew then, too.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.523
Good.

36:33.650 --> 36:34.693
Goodnight, Dembe.

36:35.485 --> 36:37.195
Goodnight, Raymond.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.532
I don't understand.
What's Hudson's angle here?

36:40.616 --> 36:42.868
Hard to say, but there are
more than a few congressmen

36:42.951 --> 36:46.413
who think they can score political points
by criticizing the Bureau these days.

36:46.496 --> 36:47.748
You think he'll call for a hearing?

36:47.831 --> 36:50.125
I think Arthur Hudson
wants answers.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.127
If he can use the current
politician climate

36:52.210 --> 36:54.671
to advance
his investigation, he will.

36:54.755 --> 36:56.173
Well, if he subpoenas our records,

36:56.256 --> 36:57.716
it's only a matter of time
before Congress

36:57.799 --> 37:01.970
finds out that Raymond Reddington
broke into a secret FBI facility,

37:02.054 --> 37:05.182
murdered two men,
and corrupted every file in this place.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.893
Opening all our former
convictions to appeal.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.561
-Mmm.
-Don't think I haven't thought about it.

37:09.645 --> 37:10.687
If we're gonna survive Arthur Hudson,

37:10.771 --> 37:13.398
we need to prove that
we are still indispensable.

37:13.482 --> 37:15.275
To do that,
we need Reddington.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.027
Dembe didn't get a sense
of where he was?

37:17.110 --> 37:20.572
Well, somewhere over the Atlantic,
but since then, who knows?

37:20.656 --> 37:22.991
Maybe helping Dembe
will inspire Reddington

37:23.075 --> 37:26.787
to start delivering us cases again,
but I wouldn't bet on it.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.581
Neither would I.
I might not like it,

37:29.665 --> 37:30.999
but there's not
a thing we can do

37:31.083 --> 37:33.460
to get Reddington to do
what we want, when we want.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.003
You want me to call Siya off?

37:35.087 --> 37:36.880
Not yet.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.298
We might not be able
to force his hand,

37:38.382 --> 37:39.925
but he should at least
know we're waiting.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.635
["Bless Me"
by Moses Sumney playing]

37:41.718 --> 37:43.720
It's so predictable

37:43.804 --> 37:45.764
To farm the parable

37:45.847 --> 37:47.474
Oh, would you please
hand me that?

37:47.557 --> 37:51.186
From every tete-a-tete

37:51.269 --> 37:54.481
Michael's on his way to Germany,
and my plane leaves in a few hours.

37:54.564 --> 37:56.274
But when you see the end

37:56.358 --> 37:58.151
What's that?

37:58.235 --> 38:00.445
An early birthday gift for Ella.

38:00.529 --> 38:01.571
Did they leave?

38:01.655 --> 38:04.783
Oh, they, uh, went
to pick up, uh, dinner.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.413
[chuckles]

38:10.622 --> 38:11.790
Bless me

38:11.873 --> 38:13.417
Oh. Thank you.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.501
You're welcome.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.628
Before you go

38:17.754 --> 38:23.176
You're going nowhere
With me

38:23.260 --> 38:24.302
Met you
In the wrestling pit

38:24.386 --> 38:25.887
I'm glad you two will be together.

38:27.180 --> 38:30.142
Obviously, not under
these circumstances, but...

38:30.225 --> 38:32.811
Ah, a body on top of me

38:32.894 --> 38:36.023
Is that the truth?

38:36.106 --> 38:38.525
You're glad Michael and I
will be together again?

38:38.608 --> 38:40.527
Stayed up past
The witching hour

38:40.610 --> 38:41.987
I'm glad he's safe.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.822
You showed me
Your secret powers

38:43.905 --> 38:47.242
I wish that mine

38:47.617 --> 38:52.581
Could freeze time

38:52.664 --> 38:54.124
Bless me

38:54.249 --> 38:56.334
Will you give this to Ella
when she comes?

38:56.418 --> 38:59.755
Before you go

38:59.838 --> 39:01.715
You're going nowhere
With me

39:01.798 --> 39:03.884
Stay for dinner.

39:03.967 --> 39:05.469
You can give it to her yourself.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.597
I don't want to impose.

39:10.182 --> 39:12.267
It's no imposition.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.977
I'm sure Ella would love to see you.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.813
You're going nowhere
With me

39:16.897 --> 39:19.232
Stay.

39:19.316 --> 39:22.444
Cupid has it out for me

39:22.778 --> 39:25.489
Gave me crooked alchemy

39:25.572 --> 39:29.618
Eros, oh, god of flings

39:29.701 --> 39:32.621
Sees the beauty
In all things

39:32.704 --> 39:36.208
As stupid is as stupid does

39:36.291 --> 39:39.920
I grasp your cloak because

39:40.003 --> 39:43.256
Maybe you'll grant me wings

39:43.340 --> 39:46.843
If I cling

39:48.762 --> 39:51.807
Bless me

39:51.890 --> 39:53.517
Hey, there.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.935
How you feeling, honeybun?

39:55.727 --> 39:58.271
-A little better.
-I'm glad.

39:59.189 --> 40:02.275
Funny, I, uh...
I don't remember

40:02.359 --> 40:03.944
buying so much
mint chocolate chip.

40:04.027 --> 40:05.195
Pinkie brought it.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.364
He came over to check on me
right after you left.

40:08.115 --> 40:09.908
I see.

40:10.575 --> 40:13.829
And did Pinkie say anything
about where he might be going?

40:15.705 --> 40:17.916
He seemed... different.

40:17.999 --> 40:21.628
Or maybe not different,
but more so.

40:21.711 --> 40:22.921
Oh? How's that?

40:23.004 --> 40:24.548
I don't know.

40:24.631 --> 40:27.843
It's like he's searching
for something but can't see it.

40:28.468 --> 40:30.512
And when he stops,
it bumps into him.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.265
It's like he's looking for something
that's already there.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.350
It's either in front of him
or behind him.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.228
And what do you suppose "it" is?

40:38.311 --> 40:39.813
Life or death, I guess.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.857
Isn't that what it usually is?

40:41.940 --> 40:43.233
Life and death?

40:43.316 --> 40:44.651
Like Charlotte's Web.

40:44.734 --> 40:47.445
Yeah. Like Charlotte's Web.

40:48.572 --> 40:51.575
I think for Pinkie,
maybe it's always been life and death.

40:52.701 --> 40:56.288
Maybe now it's just "more so,"
like you said.

40:58.832 --> 41:01.793
You love him, don't you, Pops?

41:02.878 --> 41:05.505
Before you go

41:05.589 --> 41:08.508
Sometimes he makes me
so angry,

41:08.842 --> 41:12.095
so worried,
and I hardly ever understand him.

41:13.555 --> 41:15.599
But I suppose,

41:15.682 --> 41:17.517
in a way,

41:17.601 --> 41:18.935
maybe I do.

41:20.437 --> 41:22.480
Oh, you definitely love him, Pops.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.691
I mean, how could you not?

41:24.774 --> 41:27.736
He's so soft and cuddly, like you.

41:29.070 --> 41:31.489
I think maybe that's enough
ice cream for tonight.

41:31.698 --> 41:35.285
-[laughs]
-Besides, it's time for you to go to bed.

41:35.368 --> 41:37.204
Night, Pops.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.164
Goodnight, sweetheart.

41:40.665 --> 41:44.002
Bless me

41:44.085 --> 41:46.254
Before you go

41:46.338 --> 41:47.714
"Soft and cuddly."
