11:09.002 --> 11:10.904
Oh, no, no. Hello in there.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.874
Will I be seeing you
in four months?

11:13.907 --> 11:17.044
Yes, I will.
I hope you like potpourri.

11:17.077 --> 11:20.313
Yes, I do. And I hope you
like Tupperware parties.

11:20.347 --> 11:24.217
And lots of flowers.
Lots of...

11:24.251 --> 11:27.921
It's true as well.
I do, I love 'em.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.257
I love flowers.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.009
(compère) Thank you, guys.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.412
All right, all right.
Thank you. That was great.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.849
Helen and Devon.
That's enough.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.285
Keep it down, I got neighbors.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.454
I don't know any of them,
but I got them.

12:01.488 --> 12:05.292
What are you wearing?
I don't know.
Whatever they put on me.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.060
You took these
from the photo shoot?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.929
You know you're not supposed
to take the clothes you model.

12:08.962 --> 12:12.966
Oh, right. So I guess
I should take 'em off.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.302
I'll help you.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.137
(popping sounds)

12:17.170 --> 12:19.973
What is this?
Oh, bubble wrap.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.474
(Helen laughs)

12:21.508 --> 12:24.477
The photographer wanted me
to look more buff.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.478
Ooh.
You like that?

12:25.512 --> 12:27.480
(pops bubble wrap)

12:29.983 --> 12:31.919
Hey.
Mm.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.472
Come on in.
Thank you for waiting.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.274
Any minute. Any minute.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.343
Christopher, don't make me
call for a pizza.
Any minute.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.945
(Caitlin) Hey.
(Helen) Hi, hi.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.280
Hi.
How are you?

13:00.313 --> 13:02.950
Hi. What is this?
Sunday brunch gridlock?

13:02.983 --> 13:04.317
Oh, I know. They just
keep on telling us,

13:04.351 --> 13:06.086
"Any minute now,"
like it's a mantra.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.521
Can we wait like normal,
patient adults?

13:08.555 --> 13:11.191
(all) No.
Christopher. Hi.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.928
You're among friends.
(phone rings)

13:14.962 --> 13:17.264
I would like a Bellini,
please.
Bellini.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.566
(Caitlin) Ooh, yes.
Bellini.
Bellini. Bellini.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.171
It's my sister.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.406
Jenny, can I call you back?

13:28.508 --> 13:31.211
Jenny.
Acceptable guys
at 12 o'clock.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.613
Jenny, slow down.
I can't hear you.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.950
(male friend)
Are they looking at you or me?

13:36.984 --> 13:38.551
What?

13:40.587 --> 13:43.323
Oh, no.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.159
Oh, no, Jenny.
Helen, what's the matter?

13:46.193 --> 13:49.562
Look at Helen.
Jenny...

13:49.596 --> 13:52.065
(female friend)
Helen, what happened?

13:54.601 --> 13:58.371
Hello. What is it?
Honey, what happened?

13:58.405 --> 14:02.575
(Helen, crying) What?
Are you sure?

14:08.381 --> 14:10.583
Jumped the center divide
and he slammed into them.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.585
They didn't have time to react.

14:12.619 --> 14:16.156
That's what the police
think, anyway.
I'm sorry, Ed.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.159
(woman) I remember when
they bought this house.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.593
So what happens now
with the kids?

14:20.627 --> 14:23.596
Oh, hey.
Do the kids have
any grandparents?

14:23.630 --> 14:27.500
Yes. Paul's parents
came from Miami.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.602
They just barely
made it today, so...

14:29.636 --> 14:30.603
So sorry.

14:37.077 --> 14:40.280
I'm so, so sorry
about your aunt and uncle.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.950
Thank you.
Yeah, thank you.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.848
Reverend Hallin
spoke so beautifully.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.954
Thanks again, sweetie.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.197
(rattling)

15:34.367 --> 15:36.503
(sniffing)

15:55.322 --> 15:58.258
I'm so sorry.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.261
So sorry
for your loss, Jenny.
I know, sweetheart.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.563
I know.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.369
It smells like Mommy in here.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.510
(Jenny) Guys.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.956
A lot of people are waiting
to pay their respects.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.892
I'm sure they'd appreciate it
if you all came downstairs.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.584
We are gonna get through this.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.586
All right?

17:02.355 --> 17:05.192
Hey, do you mind going
to the market for me

17:05.224 --> 17:07.859
and getting some blue
party napkins?

17:09.362 --> 17:11.964
Now? I mean, can't we
use something else?

17:13.965 --> 17:15.935
Helen.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.405
I've planned the funeral
and I've...

17:18.438 --> 17:21.674
I've made the food
and I've taken responsibility

17:21.708 --> 17:24.277
for three very scared children.

17:24.310 --> 17:27.946
All I'm asking you for
is four packages of blue,

17:27.980 --> 17:30.950
three-ply dinner napkins
with a seashell design,

17:30.983 --> 17:35.355
so that people don't remember
our sister and her husband

17:35.388 --> 17:40.093
with paper toweling
on their l... on their laps.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.097
All right.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.073
(doorbell)

17:54.107 --> 17:55.875
Terribly sorry.
Thank you.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.211
Hi, I'm Wanda from next door.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.413
If you need anything,
my phone number's
on the casserole.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.283
Thank you.
And I'm Rudy
from across the street.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.252
I also wanted
to pay my condolences.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.254
Everyone loved Lindsay and Paul.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.622
(doorbell)

18:09.656 --> 18:12.125
(sighs)

18:12.159 --> 18:15.162
(doorbell)

18:15.195 --> 18:17.164
Ball goes up...
Oh, all right.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.332
Come on through
and give your brother
a bounce pass.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.468
There you go.
Get it up. Yes!

18:21.501 --> 18:24.304
Very good. OK.
Now you give Sarah
a bounce pass.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.640
Come on, Sarah.
Come on. Come on, sweetie.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.609
(man) "Section 5."

18:29.642 --> 18:32.179
"Custody and care of
the Davis children."

18:34.547 --> 18:38.084
"An account and trust
has been set up
at Maplewood Savings Bank,

18:38.117 --> 18:42.121
in the names of Audrey,
Henry and Sarah Davis."

18:42.155 --> 18:43.523
"This bank also holds
the mortgage

18:43.556 --> 18:46.659
on the Davis property
at 207, Oak Street."

18:46.693 --> 18:49.162
Yes, Larry, and that mortgage
is quite large.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.964
We do need to talk
about that also.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.966
We will.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.470
"With regard to custody
of Audrey, Henry and Sarah,

18:57.504 --> 19:01.007
we hereby appoint
sole guardianship
of all three children,

19:01.040 --> 19:04.110
imbuing her with all legal
rights and responsibilities

19:04.143 --> 19:05.645
that guardianship entails,

19:05.678 --> 19:08.881
to Helen Harris."

19:10.517 --> 19:13.052
What?

19:13.085 --> 19:15.322
What?
It's not a mistake.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.890
I prepared this for them myself.

19:17.924 --> 19:21.328
They were very clear.
Helen Harris.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.903
Jenny should have them.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.640
I... She's got kids. I...

19:33.673 --> 19:40.313
She's got the mom haircut.
She's Supermom.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.850
She left a letter for each of
you explaining her decision.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.489
You know I handled
your mother's will.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.859
Lindsay and Paul's
was equally specific.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.336
Good Lord, Lindsay.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.938
Can I read yours?

20:05.972 --> 20:08.174
Helen.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.910
Are there any contingencies?
Yes.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.379
If Helen is either unable

20:12.412 --> 20:14.447
or unwilling to care
for the children,

20:14.481 --> 20:16.449
then you, Jenny,
are thusly appointed.

20:16.483 --> 20:20.287
OK, finally, some reason.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.954
Thank you.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.391
God, why didn't you
start with that?

20:24.424 --> 20:28.227
Can you imagine Helen
raising three kids?

20:30.096 --> 20:33.132
(Helen clears throat)

20:33.165 --> 20:35.902
When should I tell them?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.837
As soon as possible.

20:41.107 --> 20:44.110
Are you sure?
Yep.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.479
But we all thought...

20:46.513 --> 20:48.481
Nope.

20:48.515 --> 20:52.118
It's gonna be hard
to take care of us
if you're dead too.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.456
This?

20:56.489 --> 20:58.625
Won't kill me for years.

20:58.658 --> 21:02.962
Who's gonna take me to school?

21:02.995 --> 21:04.631
I guess I am.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.334
And make me chicken fingers?
Me.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.069
And give me a bath?
Me.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.139
And check my nose boogies
for infections?

21:13.172 --> 21:17.644
We'll find someone else
to do that last thing.

21:17.677 --> 21:21.013
Come here.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.483
All we gotta do is
stick together.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.619
Everything's gonna be OK.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.989
Thanks for trying, Aunt Helen,
but it's not gonna be OK.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.461
Come on, Sarah.
It's time for your bath.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.863
Come on, Henry.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.198
Good idea. Great.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.033
Uh... You guys do that,

21:41.067 --> 21:45.838
while Aunt Helen is gonna
go out and check the lawn.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.410
Is Aunt Helen older
than you, Audrey?

21:58.017 --> 22:00.319
(Audrey whispers)
Get farther down.

22:00.353 --> 22:03.055
Is she playing
hide-and-go-seek?

22:03.089 --> 22:06.292
(Audrey) I don't think so.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.260
(Henry) We are in deep shit.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.500
(Helen) I love New York pizza.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.403
Aunt Helen, can we go
to the Statue of Liberty
tomorrow?

22:16.436 --> 22:19.305
No, because we won't be here...

22:19.338 --> 22:23.009
Where's Henry?
He said he'd be
right back.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.978
I go to the bathroom
for five seconds,
and he's gone?

22:26.012 --> 22:29.416
With mustard. Here it is.
I didn't want mustard.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.917
You don't want mustard?
No.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.251
All right. No mustard.

22:32.284 --> 22:35.422
There he is.
Henry!

22:35.455 --> 22:38.391
OK? Who's gonna
pay for this?
Aunt Helen.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.860
You can't do that.
You can't just leave.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.895
I hate pizza.
I wanted a hot dog.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.164
Can you pay Aaron, please?
I'm Aaron.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.367
Hi, Aaron. I like that
he's making new friends.

22:48.401 --> 22:49.769
It's lovely.
(Aaron) Look me up!

22:49.802 --> 22:53.506
The next time you want
something like a hot dog,
you tell me, OK?

22:53.540 --> 22:55.575
And we'll all go together.
OK.

22:55.608 --> 22:59.446
Where are we going
to dinner?
This is dinner.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.615
(Sarah) Gee, Mommy
never let pizza be
our whole dinner.

23:02.649 --> 23:05.918
(Henry) And Dad always said
not to eat and walk
at the same time.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.956
(Audrey) Well, they're not
here to yell at us,
so it doesn't matter.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.425
(Henry) How many beds do you
have in your apartment,
Aunt Helen?

23:12.459 --> 23:15.194
(Sarah) Aunt Helen!
(Helen laughs)

23:15.227 --> 23:18.565
Audrey, your knee.
Stop!

23:18.598 --> 23:21.000
Hey, guys. Shh!

23:23.002 --> 23:25.472
(lisps) I'm telling you,
if we don't go to sleep
right now,

23:25.505 --> 23:28.207
Sleepless Sally
gets really upset

23:28.240 --> 23:30.209
when the kids aren't
going to sleep.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.078
Where's Sarah? Sarah?

23:32.111 --> 23:35.448
I'm right down here.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.083
Henry's feet stink. Phew!

23:37.116 --> 23:40.286
(Henry) But I'm a man.
(Audrey) Give Aunt Helen
a whiff.

23:40.319 --> 23:43.923
I don't want to smell your feet.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.459
Ew! I can smell them
from here.
Ew!

23:46.493 --> 23:50.062
Ew! Henry!
Oh, my goodness.

23:50.096 --> 23:53.933
You need to wash your feet
not once a week.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.067
(Henry) Good night, all.

23:55.101 --> 23:59.305
Audrey, get out of the bathroom.

23:59.338 --> 24:02.475
Fire! Fire!

24:02.509 --> 24:04.110
Aunt Helen?
Hm?

24:04.143 --> 24:06.479
Why are we going back?
This was great.

24:06.513 --> 24:08.648
We should spend more time here.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.617
More time?
Yeah.

24:10.650 --> 24:14.153
We can move here.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.189
We can't sleep every night
in a stinky-feet bed.

24:17.223 --> 24:20.126
We'll move to another apartment.
It's a huge city.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.629
You'll be closer to your job
and everything.

24:22.662 --> 24:25.331
You love your job.
What about Henry and Sarah?

24:25.364 --> 24:27.166
What about them?
They've got school.

24:27.199 --> 24:30.503
They have friends.
You guys grew up
in that neighborhood.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.639
That's why. It's a sad
neighborhood now.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.608
Everywhere we go there,
we think of Mom and Dad.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.945
The kids treat me
differently.
We will discuss this later.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.947
Please think about it,
Aunt Helen.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.350
OK, we got a train
to catch. Let's go.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.485
(Helen) Henry, stop
brushing your teeth.

24:46.519 --> 24:49.088
They're gonna fall out.

24:51.524 --> 24:55.862
I can't get Hippo
in the bag.
Oh, give it to me.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.065
OK.

25:00.533 --> 25:04.303
There. He's in the bag.
Are you happy now?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.972
(Helen) Henry!

25:06.005 --> 25:08.340
Now, the only thing to do
would be to tell Aunt Jenny.

25:08.374 --> 25:11.177
Thinking about it, Audrey.
I will think about it.

25:11.210 --> 25:16.148
Tell her we voted.
I'll think about it,
Audrey.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.250
I understand
the children's feelings,

25:18.284 --> 25:21.588
but that's not
part of the plan.
That's your plan, Jenny.

25:21.621 --> 25:25.858
All right, well,
what about the idea of not
selling Lindsay's house?

25:25.892 --> 25:28.861
I know you guys offered
to pay the mortgage,
but it's enormous.

25:28.895 --> 25:32.398
I spoke to the bank,
and the mortgage
is too much for us.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.934
All right.
Besides being my idea,

25:34.967 --> 25:37.369
what's wrong with moving
down the block?

25:37.403 --> 25:40.940
I mean, I think the calm
of the familiar is better

25:40.973 --> 25:44.210
than the overwhelming
hustle-bustle of the city.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.947
Guys, can you please keep
the coloring on the eggs
and not each other?

25:47.980 --> 25:50.182
Oh, no, no, no. No.

25:50.216 --> 25:53.519
Jenny, Sarah thinks that
Hippo's parents are on vacation.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.888
That they're coming back.

25:55.922 --> 26:00.026
Henry walks around like a zombie
and draws skeletons.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.962
Audrey is my only ally.
You really have to watch her.

26:02.995 --> 26:06.065
Look, they're not happy.
And they've told me themselves.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.367
They're not gonna be happy
anywhere right now.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.138
OK, OK. Wait. Wait.
Let us talk for a minute.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.206
Wait till you see what
the Easter Bunny brings.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.476
He's gonna bring
lots more eggs.
The Easter Bunny's not coming.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.545
The Easter Bunny joined 50 Cent.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.849
(Audrey) Why are you
being a brat?
(Henry) You're a brat.

26:24.350 --> 26:27.453
Helen is right.
A change might do them
some good.

26:27.486 --> 26:30.389
And if it doesn't work out,
they can always move back here
to Jersey.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.059
(Audrey) Ew, you got some
in my hair.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.562
(Sarah) You know what?
You know what?
(Helen) Oh!

26:36.595 --> 26:40.499
Oh, no.
You're not very good
at this, Aunt Helen.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.071
Stop it!
Irwin's after ya!

26:45.104 --> 26:49.541
Turtles carry...
carry diseases.
Stop it. Sarah, please.

26:51.277 --> 26:56.115
We have to find an apartment.
We need to help Aunt Helen.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.217
OK? By being quiet.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.322
(smacks lips noisily)

27:03.355 --> 27:06.125
(clicks tongue)

27:16.002 --> 27:18.170
Stop it.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.507
Stop.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.215
(Helen clicks her pen)

27:40.592 --> 27:42.228
(screams)

27:48.935 --> 27:53.305
(Helen) No. Chelsea? No.

27:53.339 --> 27:58.210
You know, I hear there's
some pretty decent stuff
in Queens.

27:58.244 --> 28:01.180
No. We are not
bridge-and-tunnel people.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.582
We are Manhattan people.

28:03.615 --> 28:06.318
(gasps) Oh, wow.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.587
Four bedrooms.
Close to Central Park.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.923
The owner wants it rented
quickly, so he's asking

28:10.957 --> 28:13.492
what is very reasonable
for a New York apartment.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.395
Only nine thousand a month.

Yeah, well,

28:59.906 --> 29:01.974
I'll put you on a waiting list

29:02.008 --> 29:05.477
And look at this -
flower power, huh?

29:05.511 --> 29:08.080
So I guess Audrey
can have the back room

29:08.114 --> 29:10.983
and Henry and Sarah
can share the middle one

29:11.017 --> 29:12.618
and I'll just sleep
on a pull-out couch.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.220
Wow, graffiti.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.622
Oh, sure, there's plenty of room
for a pull-out couch here.

29:16.655 --> 29:17.957
Look, you got a nice view.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.928
So, in the ad it said something
about a visual security system.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.496
How does that work?
Oh, when somebody buzzes,

29:24.530 --> 29:26.632
you stick your head out
the window and you look down.

29:26.665 --> 29:29.969
That's the visual part.
And then you yell for them
to come up or not.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.270
That's the security part.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.606
Here's your keys.
Welcome to the Astoria Arms.

29:34.640 --> 29:38.110
I am only available between
8:30 and nine in the morning

29:38.144 --> 29:40.012
because I have a life.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.351
So...

29:45.384 --> 29:46.518
home!

29:46.552 --> 29:48.520
(Sarah) Yay!

29:50.522 --> 29:52.491
♪ ("Chori Chori Gori Se") ♪

29:57.063 --> 30:00.299
(Jenny) I ordered the pizza.
It should be here
in 30 minutes.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.467
(Ed) Yay!

30:01.500 --> 30:03.836
Um...

30:03.870 --> 30:07.940
Know what,
I bet this is lead paint.

30:07.974 --> 30:10.342
Guys. Guys, guys.

30:10.376 --> 30:14.013
Don't chew on the windowsills,
all right?

30:14.046 --> 30:18.150
Yeah. Stick to the table legs,
like I taught you.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.986
(Ed) OK, come on, guys.
Let's go, let's go.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.653
Sometime today.
Into the bedroom.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.190
This window is also
painted shut.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.192
You know, I mean,
for 1200 a month,

30:26.225 --> 30:29.128
you'd think you'd have
windows that open.

30:29.161 --> 30:32.031
I want this bed.
Look, for the tenth time,

30:32.064 --> 30:36.635
in the old house
I had this bed
and you had that bed.

30:36.668 --> 30:41.407
But I want this bed.
That's it! Hippo goes
out the window.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.510
Followed by Irwin!
(Jenny) Guys!

30:44.543 --> 30:49.048
Stop fighting. He pinches her
all the time, and hard.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.917
It's hard.
I know.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.184
(sighs)

30:52.218 --> 30:54.353
Thank you.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.490
So, it's not that bad,
right, Jen?

30:58.524 --> 31:00.192
No.

31:04.130 --> 31:07.499
Hi.
I'm Nilma Prasad.
I live across the hall.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.002
Here's some samosas
that we made for you.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.905
Oh. So that would
make you my neighbor.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.874
This is my neighbor,
my friendly neighbor, Jenny.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.509
Nilma, I'm Helen.
No, I'm Nilma.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.345
I'm Helen. That's Jenny.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.080
I snagged this one in the
hallway, screaming.

31:21.113 --> 31:25.184
It's OK, Flora.
Mr. Costello's deaf.
(Flora) I'm not.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.186
(Nilma speaks Hindi)

31:27.219 --> 31:31.457
So I see you have kids too,
so maybe a play date sometime?

31:31.490 --> 31:35.861
Oh! Oh, my goodness,
that would be wonderful.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.296
Oh, great.

31:37.329 --> 31:41.200
I'm Jenny, Helen's sister.
Hello.

31:41.233 --> 31:45.304
Can I ask you
a special favor?
Yes.

31:45.337 --> 31:48.607
Helen is new at being a mom.
Uh-oh.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.909
Exactly.
These aren't her kids?

31:50.943 --> 31:55.114
Our sister passed.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Bless her.

31:55.147 --> 31:58.951
So, Nilma, if you could
from time to time...
Oh, absolutely.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.320
And if they...
Which they will, no?

32:01.353 --> 32:03.389
You could...
No problem.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.891
That's all I'm asking.
OK, say no more, please.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.460
Thank you so much.
OK, no problem.

32:10.162 --> 32:13.465
Just mommy talk.
Oh, right.

32:13.499 --> 32:18.037
So, Helen, where have you
decided to send the kids
to school?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.542
Got it covered.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.615
It's just middle school,

32:29.648 --> 32:31.984
and you'll both have
to be separated,

32:32.018 --> 32:33.185
all three of you.
(Sarah) No!

32:33.219 --> 32:35.187
I know.
I vote against separation.

32:35.221 --> 32:38.857
You know, maybe we should find
a school with less policemen
everywhere.

32:40.359 --> 32:43.462
Audrey. Hi. Let's go.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.998
Come on, guys. This cab's
gonna be about $100.

32:46.032 --> 32:50.502
(boy) Oh, that girl is fine.
Hi. Yeah, she's pretty.

32:50.536 --> 32:55.574
Nice, Audrey. Thanks for
making my life a lot easier.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.148
(Audrey)
I don't like school, anyway.

33:02.181 --> 33:05.484
I mean, I'll just drop out
and get a job.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.853
(Sarah) I like school.
I wanna go to school.
I want to.

33:07.886 --> 33:10.556
(Henry) Aunt Helen,
you promised you'd find us
a school.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.025
(Helen) Oh, God, help me.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.593
(church bell)

33:17.663 --> 33:21.500
(Helen) Slow down. Stop.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.170
That was fast. Kids.

33:27.239 --> 33:30.576
Lisa, stop dragging

34:41.147 --> 34:45.284
for as long as Lutheran people
have been around.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.620
Being a Lutheran
is the greatest.
I mean, right, kids?

34:48.654 --> 34:51.889
Hippo wants to be
a Lutheran, too.

34:51.922 --> 34:55.561
Hippo is a Lutheran.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.329
I knew that God told us
to move here

34:57.363 --> 35:00.599
so that we could attend
your fine school.

35:00.632 --> 35:04.503
A good, solid education
taught our Lutheran way
is the best way.

35:04.536 --> 35:08.640
I mean, isn't that right,
Father?
Pastor.

35:08.674 --> 35:11.109
Father Pastor.
Pastor Parker.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.511
Right.

35:14.980 --> 35:18.417
Thank you for that
fine testimonial.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.951
Hallelujah.

35:19.985 --> 35:22.321
Hallelujah.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.423
Well. I'm just gonna need

35:24.456 --> 35:26.958
the kids' transcripts and
blood tests, and they're in.

35:26.992 --> 35:30.196
Blood tests?
Make sure they're
really Lutheran.

35:30.229 --> 35:34.866
You'd be surprised how many
non-Lutherans try to sneak in.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.637
I'm sure. Um, problem.

35:38.670 --> 35:43.509
They're all hemophiliacs.
All three of them.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.044
(whispering)
Can't take blood. Shh.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.214
They're sensitive.
It's a joke.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.982
Why would I joke
about hemophilia?

35:51.016 --> 35:54.052
There's no blood test.
That's the joke.

35:54.085 --> 35:55.621
Oh.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.889
You don't have to be Lutheran
to go here. It's Queens.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.326
There's, like, 50 Lutheran kids
in the whole neighborhood.

36:00.359 --> 36:01.527
Shall we take a look around?

36:01.560 --> 36:05.163
So we have space available.
Can you handle the tuition?

36:05.197 --> 36:07.899
(Helen) Not a problem.
(Sarah) Tetherball!

36:07.933 --> 36:10.236
Oh, yay!

36:10.269 --> 36:12.471
Henry, we have basketball
courts, gym down there.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.173
Saint Barbara's believes
in basketball.
Oh.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.309
So what's the Lutheran take
on the afterlife?

36:17.343 --> 36:20.979
Pretty much the standard
heaven, hell, purgatory thing?

36:21.012 --> 36:22.848
Yeah, pretty much.
Old-school around here.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.317
(Helen) Hey, so you wanna go
see the basketball courts?

36:25.351 --> 36:28.487
No, I'm gonna go
play tetherball.
Oh, OK.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.855
Play hard!
OK.

36:29.888 --> 36:33.091
Pastor Dan.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.660
Hello.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.928
Excuse me.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.498
Mrs. Fricker,
I know what you got there.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.667
I made you some
special brownies.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.370
Wow. You, uh...
I'm gonna...

36:44.403 --> 36:48.173
He gets a lot of brownies.
I see that.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.209
Mm. Better than last time.

36:51.243 --> 36:53.879
Hi, I'm Phyllis Shore.
Helen Harris.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.081
This is my daughter Lisa.
Hi, Lisa.

36:56.114 --> 36:59.951
Will you be joining us
at Saint Barbara's?
I hope so.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.888
Thank you.
I'll see you Sunday.
OK. Bye-bye.

37:02.921 --> 37:05.291
See you Sunday night
at vespers.
See you at vespers.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.926
See you at vespers.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.161
You know what vespers is?

37:11.663 --> 37:13.899
Some kind of scooter?

37:13.932 --> 37:15.934
Close enough.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.308
(Helen) We got ten minutes.
You don't want to be late

37:22.341 --> 37:24.242
for your first day of school.

37:24.276 --> 37:25.711
Audrey.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.315
Please get out
of the bathroom.
(Audrey) I'm not in there.

37:29.348 --> 37:33.352
(tearfully) Can't do it.
I don't remember how.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.124
Sweetie.

37:39.157 --> 37:42.328
I don't remember how.
What's the matter?

37:42.361 --> 37:45.631
Your shoes?
Here, let me help you.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.066
No! No!

37:48.099 --> 37:51.437
Sarah, sweetheart,
we have to go to school.

37:51.470 --> 37:54.072
OK? Let me help you.
No, no!

37:54.105 --> 37:56.942
That's not how.
You don't know how.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.445
Sweetheart, are you
nervous about today?

37:59.478 --> 38:02.147
I mean, it's a big day
at school.

38:02.180 --> 38:05.517
Mom was teaching her how to
tie her shoelaces just before.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.156
Oh.

38:11.189 --> 38:13.425
Right.

38:13.459 --> 38:17.629
And I guess she had
a special way of tying them.

38:17.663 --> 38:21.633
Well, your mom and I were
probably taught the same way.

38:21.667 --> 38:25.471
Let me think.
Something about...

38:25.504 --> 38:27.005
Bunnies.

38:27.038 --> 38:30.041
Bunnies.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.544
Right. Bunny ears.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.516
You make two bunny ears,

38:38.984 --> 38:41.987
bunny goes around the tree,

38:42.020 --> 38:45.023
into the burrow,

38:45.056 --> 38:46.492
pull tight.

38:46.525 --> 38:49.595
Yeah. Yeah.

38:55.434 --> 38:58.069
Hurry up, hurry up.
When will you be home
from work?

38:58.103 --> 39:00.972
By dinnertime. Audrey's in
charge, so listen to her, OK?

39:01.006 --> 39:03.308
I don't wanna listen to her.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.544
Pastor Dan.
Pastor Dan.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.179
Well, it's the four Lutherans.
Here we are.

39:08.213 --> 39:09.548
Here you are.
Pastor Wells,

39:09.581 --> 39:12.017
would you please show Henry
and Audrey to the home room?

39:12.050 --> 39:13.151
Sure.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.653
Hello, Audrey.
Bye.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.555
Bye. Pay attention!
Sit up straight.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.324
Good morning.
Wait, what about lunch?

39:19.357 --> 39:23.194
Eat it, it's healthy.
I meant, we don't have any.

39:23.228 --> 39:26.898
Oh! Right.
I'll take care of it.

39:26.932 --> 39:29.501
Bye.

39:29.535 --> 39:33.605
Can you break a 20?
Always got change
in the collection plate.

39:33.639 --> 39:36.408
And kindergarten?
Right over here.

39:36.442 --> 39:39.611
Oh, wow, look.
It's a juggling pastor, Sarah.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.447
(laughs)

39:41.480 --> 39:44.249
Hello, welcome.
Mrs. LaGambina.

39:44.282 --> 39:47.052
Helen Harris.
This is Sarah.
Hello, Sarah.

39:47.085 --> 39:49.588
Look at all this fun stuff.
You've got markers

39:49.621 --> 39:52.190
and crayons, coloring books,
and all the nice people.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.593
Hi. You're gonna have
such a good time.

39:54.626 --> 39:58.063
(Mrs. LaGambina) We were all
drawing our favorite animal.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.065
Lily was drawing a cat.

40:01.467 --> 40:04.302
Sarah, do you want some crayons?

40:04.335 --> 40:07.906
Oh, no, not those.
Those are the teacher's markers.

40:07.939 --> 40:11.076
You'd better put your sweater
on. It's chilly outside.

40:13.311 --> 40:16.915
OK, that was funny.
Sorry, Sarah.

40:18.517 --> 40:21.219
You could've just told me.
More fun this way.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.954
(Mrs. LaGambina)
Well, now, who's this?
(Sarah) Hippo.

40:22.988 --> 40:24.956
Everybody, meet Hippo.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.493
(Dominique) All right,
all right, all right.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.160
Enough. Come on,
let's get started.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.897
Hi, Lacey. Hey.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.832
Helen.

40:33.865 --> 40:37.302
I told you I'd make it back.
Good. Sit down, sweetie.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.404
Who's that?
That's the intern.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.941
Move over, intern.
Caitlin, move.

40:42.974 --> 40:47.178
OK, good. Now, what about
the Armani deal?

40:47.212 --> 40:49.447
Is that gonna be completed
in my lifetime?

40:49.481 --> 40:52.984
Tom made it happen this morning,
and you're all set
for your trip to Miami.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.320
Good.
You're gonna love it there.

40:55.353 --> 40:59.024
Me?
Well, yes.
You're back, I need you.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.093
Dominique, I...

41:02.127 --> 41:05.263
I can't just pick up
and leave for a week right now.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.599
Why?
(whispers) I have...

41:07.633 --> 41:11.169
Oh. The babies. Hm.

41:11.202 --> 41:14.339
All right, who wants to take
this little mummy's place

41:14.372 --> 41:17.308
on a first-class trip to Miami?

41:17.342 --> 41:20.612
Caitlin. You're on.
Helen will tell you
what to bring.

41:20.646 --> 41:24.482
Don't wear any of those
midriff-baring outfits.
It's so last year.

41:24.516 --> 41:27.152
And I want my luggage
Federal Expressed ahead of time.

41:27.185 --> 41:31.122
Right, that's it.
Lacey, who am I having lunch
with today?

41:31.156 --> 41:33.491
Was it Vogue or Elle or...?
Vogue at Cipriani.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.627
OK. Good.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.529
Good to have you back, sweetie.

41:37.563 --> 41:39.998
We'll go over everything else
at the fashion show tonight.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.333
Tonight?

41:42.367 --> 41:44.870
Unless, of course, you've got
a Brownie meeting or something.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.504
Oh, no, no, no.
I'll be there.

41:46.538 --> 41:48.439
Good.
OK.

42:01.386 --> 42:02.654
Hola!
(man) Sweetheart,
over here.

42:02.688 --> 42:03.722
Hi.
Who's your date?

42:03.755 --> 42:06.057
His name is Pâté.
(man #2) Big smile.

42:06.091 --> 42:07.158
(man) Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.994
Please take your seats.
The show's about to begin.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.663
That's Martina, the supermodel,
sitting next to Dominique.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.231
Who are the ladies on the end?

42:13.264 --> 42:15.433
Those are the agents we're
trying to steal her from.

42:15.466 --> 42:19.104
Hello.
You have a lovely agency. Yes.

42:19.137 --> 42:21.172
I think we should have lunch.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.508
Take the houselights out
and go Cue One.

42:23.541 --> 42:26.978
Hi, Teddy.
Hi. Kids, don't touch
the runway lights.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.916
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Thanks.

42:30.949 --> 42:33.218
Hey, hi.
(Audrey) Front row seats!

42:33.251 --> 42:35.453
(Dominique) What's all this?
(Henry) There's no room.

42:35.486 --> 42:37.623
(Helen) Can you squash down
just a little bit more?

42:37.656 --> 42:39.891
Don't these children
live in Queens?
I know.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.927
I know. I couldn't find
anybody to watch them.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.295
But don't worry, you won't
even know they're here.

42:44.329 --> 42:45.597
I'm here to work.

42:45.631 --> 42:48.333
This child's wearing pajamas.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.070
(Sarah) Aunt Helen, I'm hungry.

42:52.103 --> 42:56.307
Well, you should've
eaten your hamburger.
It had onions.

42:56.341 --> 42:59.945
OK. Take care of her a sec.
I'll be right back.

42:59.978 --> 43:01.847
Keep an eye on her.
You're going?

43:05.651 --> 43:07.585
Keep an eye on Sarah.

43:16.327 --> 43:19.230
Hey, partner. Working on
your lingerie merit badge?

43:19.264 --> 43:20.331
I'm a buyer from
Victoria's Secret.

43:20.365 --> 43:23.234
You're with Helen and you should
go back to your seat.

43:23.268 --> 43:25.170
Yeah. Go for Teddy.

43:27.038 --> 43:30.942
Does my nose boogie look green?

43:30.976 --> 43:33.244
Yes, as a matter of fact,
it does.

43:33.278 --> 43:36.982
Sort of Prada green.
Not their best collection.
Put it back inside.

Oh, no. Sarah, what are
you doing? Are you OK?

44:13.518 --> 44:16.521
(Sarah) What happened?
Everything's OK.

44:34.039 --> 44:37.008
All set. The limo's downstairs.

44:37.042 --> 44:40.545
Martina.
Welcome to our agency.
Thanks. I'm so excited.

You can be effusive on the way

Hi, it's Dan.
Dan. What's wrong?

44:56.061 --> 44:58.864
Um, nothing is wrong.

44:58.897 --> 45:01.867
We just have a little situation
with Sarah down here.

45:01.900 --> 45:05.170
I think you should come
to the school.
Come there now?

45:05.203 --> 45:08.073
It's a little difficult
to get to school right now.

45:08.106 --> 45:10.441
I'm working. Is she OK?

45:10.475 --> 45:14.412
Helen. Give me the phone.

45:14.445 --> 45:16.281
Yeah. Hi.

45:16.314 --> 45:19.617
We'll be right there. OK.

45:19.650 --> 45:21.586
Are you sure?
No problem.

45:21.619 --> 45:23.588
Thank you.
We have plenty of time.

45:23.621 --> 45:27.058
I know how it is.
I have a four-year-old.

45:30.428 --> 45:33.398
Then I couldn't find
the burrow for the bunny.

45:33.431 --> 45:36.567
I hate it when that happens.
Me too.

45:36.601 --> 45:39.838
You guys wanna do my makeup?
(girls) Yeah.

45:41.172 --> 45:44.309
Can I be a princess?
(girl) Yeah. You're pretty.

45:44.342 --> 45:46.277
OK.

45:46.311 --> 45:49.614
Sarah, you don't have to learn
to tie your shoes right now.

45:49.647 --> 45:52.217
When you're ready to tie
your shoes, you will.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.585
That's right.
Shoe-tying's tough.

45:54.619 --> 45:57.255
Why do you think Jesus
wore sandals?

45:58.990 --> 46:01.993
See ya.
(Helen)
Thanks, Pastor Dan.

46:02.027 --> 46:05.496
Do I look pretty?
(girls) Yeah.

Everything's gonna be fine.

Stop!

46:17.976 --> 46:20.411
Are those permanent?

It's OK, it happens to me
all the time.

46:23.148 --> 46:25.316
It'll come off
in a couple of days.

46:30.655 --> 46:33.624
Sorry, Helen.

46:33.658 --> 46:35.961
It's not working.

46:39.230 --> 46:41.466

Now we can watch MTV.
Yeah.

I'm living my life,

not really in touch
with the fact that

48:18.930 --> 48:22.300
I'm sharing this planet

has made, shall we say,

48:25.636 --> 48:28.139
an indelible impact
on my career.

48:28.173 --> 48:30.308
Hey, Helen.
A black mark on my record,

48:30.341 --> 48:32.944
X-ed out my future...
Helen.

48:32.978 --> 48:36.047
...and, in short,
my career is dead.

Oh, shut up.

It's his friend. He's...

49:40.211 --> 49:43.314
I mean...
I know what you mean.

49:43.348 --> 49:45.650
So, how are things going?

49:45.683 --> 49:48.053
Fine.
Hm?

49:48.086 --> 49:50.955
Fine.
Just fine?

49:50.988 --> 49:53.891
Yeah. What do you mean?
Well, it's just that

49:53.924 --> 49:56.327
I've noticed Audrey spending
too much time with the boys.

49:56.361 --> 49:59.330
You know, that's normal
for what she's going through,

49:59.364 --> 50:00.698
you know,
look for that attention,

50:00.731 --> 50:03.501
but some of these kids
are not exactly angels,
you know what I mean?

50:03.534 --> 50:06.003
They're 15.
It's teenage stuff.

50:06.037 --> 50:08.005
It's harmless.
No, it's not really harmless,

50:08.039 --> 50:10.241
'cause one of these punks
- his name's BZ -

50:10.275 --> 50:12.410
I'm about to kick his butt
outta school.

50:12.443 --> 50:14.845
Let's just get upstairs
before Henry finds the bowl.

50:14.879 --> 50:17.148
Yeah, Henry. You said
the kid likes basketball.

50:17.182 --> 50:21.052
He never, ever
picks up a ball.
I know. I've noticed that.

50:21.086 --> 50:24.021
The thing with Sarah
and the shoes the other day,
that's not the first time...

50:24.055 --> 50:26.591
Hey, what do you expect, Dan?

50:26.624 --> 50:30.095
They've lost their parents,
they've moved to a new city,

50:30.128 --> 50:32.397
changed schools,
changed religions.

50:32.430 --> 50:36.601
Well, let's talk about some
things you could do at home.

50:36.634 --> 50:38.503
You wanna know
what I've been doing at home?

50:38.536 --> 50:41.539
I've been doing the best I can.

50:41.572 --> 50:45.210
Do you have any idea what
this has done to my life?

50:45.243 --> 50:48.479
Hey, Helen, do you have any idea
what it's done to theirs?

50:50.448 --> 50:53.284
Hey, Pastor Dan,
Mr. Self-righteous,

50:53.318 --> 50:56.187
I'm hanging on by a thread here.

50:56.221 --> 50:58.623
I lost my sister,
my social life,

50:58.656 --> 51:00.458
my disposable income,

51:00.491 --> 51:02.627
my ability to fit
into a size two

51:02.660 --> 51:05.196
and - this just in - my job.

51:05.230 --> 51:07.265
Pretty much the only two things
that haven't disappeared

51:07.298 --> 51:09.634
are my nicotine fits
and the few pounds

51:09.667 --> 51:12.570
that have recently taken up
residence on my ass.

51:12.603 --> 51:16.474
So forgive me if I'm not too
thrilled about being lectured,

51:16.507 --> 51:17.975
in Queens,

51:18.008 --> 51:20.478
about being a lousy legal
guardian to three kids

51:20.511 --> 51:23.314
who maybe shouldn't have been
given to me in the first place.

51:23.348 --> 51:25.049
Well, they weren't given to you.

51:25.082 --> 51:27.084
They were entrusted to you
by their mother, who...

51:27.118 --> 51:29.587
Don't you talk about Lindsay!

51:29.620 --> 51:31.589
Don't you dare talk
about Lindsay!

51:31.622 --> 51:33.558
You didn't know her.

51:33.591 --> 51:36.394
Gimme the turtle.
That was outta line.
I'm sorry.

51:36.427 --> 51:39.164
Dan, give me the damn turtle.

54:57.895 --> 55:00.431
OK, but what if they ask why?

You, get out of here.
No.

Chill out, Miss Rambo.

Can I ask you a question?

57:14.431 --> 57:17.502
What was Lindsay thinking?

57:26.644 --> 57:28.613
So listen, don't worry about it.

57:28.646 --> 57:30.948
They'll appreciate it
when they're older.

57:30.981 --> 57:33.250
I know.
I just hate being hated.

57:33.283 --> 57:36.086
I love it.

57:36.120 --> 57:39.289
I don't have that
relationship...
You do.

57:39.323 --> 57:42.493
You know, you can tell me
all your problems, really.

57:42.527 --> 57:44.962
I'm a solver.

57:44.995 --> 57:48.265
I once got an axle-grease stain
out of silk.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.467
OK, solver,
can you find me a job

57:50.501 --> 57:53.437
close to home with decent pay?

57:53.470 --> 57:56.106
And a dental plan
for the cavity triplets?

57:56.140 --> 57:58.308

58:05.883 --> 58:07.518

find a Ravi Prasad?

58:07.552 --> 58:09.520
Yeah, he's inside.

58:11.188 --> 58:13.624
You'll see, we're like
one big family here.

58:13.658 --> 58:16.193
Now, the owner, Mr. Massey,
nice guy, very fair,

58:16.226 --> 58:17.962
but he's picky
about who he hires.

58:17.995 --> 58:20.364
Hey, Ralphy, any takers
on that lime-green baby?

58:20.397 --> 58:22.032

58:22.066 --> 58:26.336
I still got five bucks
says you'll sell it.
You're on.

58:26.370 --> 58:28.639
We got... We got stuck with
this lime-green Lincoln.

58:28.673 --> 58:31.375
Been here for months.
Mr. Massey's offering a ham

58:31.408 --> 58:33.243
to the first person
who can sell it.

58:33.277 --> 58:35.045
A ham?
Oh, yeah.

58:35.079 --> 58:38.082
Guys are big on free meats
around here.

58:38.115 --> 58:41.151
Now, listen. Mr. Massey's
a little nervous.

58:41.185 --> 58:44.922
He acted in his first
on-camera TV commercial today.

58:44.955 --> 58:47.992
And see me, Mickey Massey,
a name you can trust.

58:48.025 --> 58:50.160
Uh... Yeah, I forgot to point.

58:50.194 --> 58:52.863
You want a deal on
a previously owned car?

58:52.897 --> 58:56.500
Well, come...

58:56.533 --> 58:59.503
It's me. Yeah. Commercial.

Come in.

59:04.975 --> 59:06.343

59:06.376 --> 59:07.612

the wrong way again.

59:07.645 --> 59:09.279
Hi, I'm Helen.

59:09.313 --> 59:12.149
Sit. I'll be with ya
in a second. Just sit.

59:13.618 --> 59:16.420
Remember: Massey means trust.

59:19.990 --> 59:23.093
What'd you think of that?
I believe it.

59:23.127 --> 59:25.596
Don't.
"Massey" doesn't mean trust.

59:25.630 --> 59:29.834
It means "hillside" in French.
I can't do dishonest.

59:31.401 --> 59:34.138
Ravi, we're reshooting
that commercial.

59:34.171 --> 59:38.976
Honest. We need an honest
commercial, Ravi. All right?

59:39.009 --> 59:41.946
I'm sorry.
Ms. Helen Harris. OK.
Yes.

59:41.979 --> 59:44.314
How long did you work
as a secretary?

59:44.348 --> 59:47.251

59:47.284 --> 59:49.654

to Dominique Courier,

59:49.687 --> 59:53.257

of promotion to agent.

59:53.290 --> 59:54.558

59:54.591 --> 59:56.560
You seem like a nice girl,
Helen.

59:56.593 --> 01:00:00.397
And you're a friend
of Ravi and Nilma's.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.466
All right, we're looking
for a receptionist.

01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:05.335
The pay is 17.50 an hour,
the hours are nine to five.

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:08.138
So, how does that suit you, hm?

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:11.141
I always thought I could have
a career in used cars one day.

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:14.144
We don't sell used cars.
Previously owned

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:17.481

Prior-owned.

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:22.219

Not until you show me yours.

01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:32.349

just do it after dinner?

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:36.053

What happened with the train?
Was there a delay?

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.560
No, no. Audrey was making
samosas at Nilma's,

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:47.965
so we caught the next train.
Mm-hmm. Just one?

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:51.268
Well, they were hungry
so they ate them on the way.

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:53.470
Huh.

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:55.272
Can I help you
with something, Jenny?

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:58.642
You know what?
I've got everything organized.

01:02:58.675 --> 01:03:00.477
Ooh. Ooh.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.479
Sweetie, what did Mommy
say about kicking

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:03.981
when she's having
a conversation?

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:07.151
You need to wait
until she's finished.

01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:09.319
Thank you very much.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:12.022
Did you just boss
around the unborn?

01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:17.094
It's never too early
to start learning manners.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.330
OK, kids. We're ready.

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:24.969
Whoa!

01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:26.937
Wow!

01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:29.206
Oh, my gosh.
(Jenny) Look at that.
Hey, guys.

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.508
Holy cow.
(Jenny) Yeah.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.477
Oliver, did you
wash your hands?
Yes, Mom.

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.145
Everything tastes great, honey.

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:37.047
You shouldn't have had
to cook on Mother's Day.

01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:38.949
You know I don't mind.

01:03:38.983 --> 01:03:43.020
Being a mom is
the greatest job on earth.

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:47.157
I know your mom felt that way.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:50.995
Jenny.
What?

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:53.230
We all love her.
We miss her.

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:56.000
We can mention her.
Can't we?

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:57.935
I don't like to.

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:03.507
(Sarah) Me neither.

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:09.846
You know, would you kids
like to talk about
what you've been reading?

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.316
Harry Potter.
Harry Potter.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.484
Stuff by Shank 54.

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.554
Huh. That sounds interesting.
Who's that?

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:20.857
He writes poems...
on the side of our building.

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:22.592
With spray paint
at four in the morning.

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:24.594
Sometimes I help
when I can't sleep

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.230
because Aunt Helen's on a date

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:30.100
or Audrey's on the Internet
talking dirty

01:04:30.134 --> 01:04:32.502
or Sarah's crying
because we forgot
to feed her again.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:34.538
Henry! What?

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:40.044
Jenny, no.

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:43.247
Henry, what are you
talking about?

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.182
Is this some kind of joke?

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.551
I don't know why you keep
saying things like this.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:49.920
It's not funny!

01:04:49.954 --> 01:04:52.289
I thought it was funny.
Thank you.

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:55.592
Henry was making
all of that up, Jenny.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:56.927
Jenny, what are you doing?

01:04:56.961 --> 01:04:59.463
"When a problem comes along
you must whip it.
Give me my letter.

01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:01.298
Before the cream..."

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:03.968
Jenny, give me my letter.
That's it?

01:05:04.001 --> 01:05:06.470
That's all she left behind
to explain why she chose you?

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:10.207
The lyrics to "Whip It"?
It makes sense to me.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.609
What is it with you two
and that song?

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:15.312
It's ridiculous.
I don't get it.

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:17.481
Exactly!
What are you saying?

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:20.484
That that's the point?
That I'm no fun?

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:24.221
That I don't get things?
That I never make jokes?

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.656
Show me your letter.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:28.292
No!

01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:32.062
No? No?
What do you mean "no"?

01:05:32.096 --> 01:05:34.331
We said you would read my letter
and I would read yours.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:36.633
This is not a letter.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:40.070
These are lyrics.
Nonsensical lyrics.

01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:42.306
This is not a letter!
If this was a letter,

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:46.476
you could read my letter,
but this is not a letter!

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.013
(Helen) Not a letter?

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:53.517
What? You are a smug,

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:56.987
bitter, colossal bitch!

01:05:57.021 --> 01:05:59.923
(whines)
OK. Guys.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:04.328
I think this is a good time
to take Origami for a walk.

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:06.330
No, we'll miss the fight.

01:06:06.363 --> 01:06:09.633
If you're finished, I think
I'd like to serve dessert.

01:06:11.235 --> 01:06:13.137
(Helen) You don't wanna help me.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.638
You just wanna judge me.

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:16.473
Um, let's all go
into the living room

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:19.943
and listen to Jasmine
play the piano with one arm.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.612
You just wanna prove that
you're a better mother than me

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.148
and that Lindsay was wrong.

01:06:24.181 --> 01:06:25.949
Why would I need to prove that?

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.318
Of course I'm a better
mother than you!

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:31.321
I've been doing it forever.
But does that matter? No.

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:33.190
She still chose you over me.

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:36.493
Exactly!
She chose, Jenny. Not me.

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:39.196
I had no control over it.

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:44.501
You're angry with me
because of a decision
that she made for me.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:47.204
Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:48.138
Life is but...

01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:51.007
I am giving up everything
for these kids,

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:53.877
and you have no idea
what that's like.

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:57.147
I don't know what it's like?
How do you think I got this way?

01:06:57.181 --> 01:07:01.251
Whatever this way is that's so
particularly unfun and funny.

01:07:01.285 --> 01:07:04.388
Who changed your diapers?
Oh, don't start with that.

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:06.390
Mom died when I was seven.

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:10.427
Who fed you?
Who baby-sat you?

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.028
Lindsay was there, too.

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:14.064
Lindsay was in New York,
trying to be a dancer

01:07:14.098 --> 01:07:17.000
and I was at home
not having a normal childhood

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.336
'cause I was too busy
being your mommy.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.372
And you're Tra-La-La Helen.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:27.877
So... free.

01:07:27.911 --> 01:07:30.180
Miss Party-Party-
All-Night-Long

01:07:30.214 --> 01:07:34.218
and I never ever got
to feel like that, ever.

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:38.488
Not once.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:45.329
I don't wanna fight anymore.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:52.102
Happy Mother's Day.

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:04.414
(referee blows whistle)
42 - foul.

01:08:04.448 --> 01:08:07.083
Flagrant!
(commentator)
One minute left.

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:09.386
Maybe I can come see you
DJ sometime.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:10.954
I don't know, Miss Audrey.

01:08:10.987 --> 01:08:14.424
I'm not spinning no kids'
birthday parties, you know?

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:17.026
You got a fake ID?
Of course.

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:20.830
Nurse Wilson says he's OK.

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:25.469
When is Henry gonna play,
Aunt Helen?

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:28.404
Uh...

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:31.140
Hey, Coach.
This isn't the NBA Finals.

01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:34.344
What happens to
"everybody plays"?
Why don't you put Henry in?

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:37.180
3, 2, 1.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:40.450
And Saint Barbara's wins.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:44.154
Excuse me.
Yes?

01:08:44.188 --> 01:08:47.491
Hi. Excuse me.
What is your problem?
Aunt Helen, please.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:50.160
I know, I...
He could be one
of your best players.

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:54.997
He doesn't wanna play
so you need to square
that away with him.

01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:58.134
You're the coach.
(Henry) Forget about it.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.170
I'm gonna go change.

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:04.174
I'm sorry that I yelled
at you, Dan,

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:06.310
but I've been battling
with the kids,

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:08.312
and I'm fighting with my sister,

01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:12.182
and we're too stubborn
to talk to each other.

01:09:12.216 --> 01:09:14.518
I guess I'm just edgy.

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:19.323
Hey, nobody ever said
it was gonna be easy. Right?

01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:22.158
Yeah, try doing it on your own.

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:24.328
We got a lot of people
around here who do.

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:26.529
Matt Higgins' mom,
she took a pay cut-

01:09:26.563 --> 01:09:28.532
she works out of her house.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:32.336
And Tommy Meyers' dad is
with the kids all day long,
then he works at night.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:35.238
I mean, it's tough,
but it can be done.

01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:37.241
Hey, you know what you need?
A nanny.

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:40.076
But I can't afford one.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.645
You need some fun.
I'm just the man to provide it.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.582
What are you doing on Sunday?

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:49.185
Going to church, of course.
Yeah, right.

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:51.321
Nice try.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.857
You and the kids.
Sunday afternoon.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:56.293
What do you have in mind?

01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:59.896
Today we're at
the Central Park Zoo,

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:02.232
where every spring
a prayer is said,

01:10:02.266 --> 01:10:05.168
blessing the animals
and the newborn babies.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.903
(reporter) Pastor?

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:10.039
Dear Lord, we humbly ask
that you bless these animals

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:13.377
and all your creatures
throughout the world.

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:15.379
Blessed are You, Lord. Amen.

01:10:19.416 --> 01:10:22.886
OK, who wants a private tour
of the zoo, huh?

01:10:22.919 --> 01:10:25.622
(Sarah) Yeah!

01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:26.015
(Henry) Thanks again,
Pastor Dan.
Sure.

01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:27.484
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:29.185
Thank you, Pastor Dan.
Loved the sea lions.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.488
Henry, give that back to her.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:34.491
Don't do that.
That's not nice.

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:37.494
He is so bad sometimes.
They're cute, though.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:39.996
Listen, I'm not very good at
this, so I'm just gonna ask.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.332
You wanna go out
with me sometime?

01:11:42.366 --> 01:11:44.868
What?
You and me, on a date.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:48.872
Oh, no. I made you
abandon your vows?

01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:53.042
I know you think
that I'm probably worth it,
and I'm not.

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:55.979
Go back to God.
I can't be responsible
for this.

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:58.848
Hey, Helen. I'm a pastor.

01:11:58.882 --> 01:12:01.485
I'm a Lutheran minister.
I can date.

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:04.454
I can get married, have kids,
watch dirty movies.

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:07.056
Oh, really?
Yeah.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:09.993
OK, I can't watch dirty movies,
but we're pushing for it,

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:12.996
so, you know...
What d'you say?

01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:16.165
I'm really flattered, Dan,
but I...

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:19.869
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:22.572
I had a great day,
though, today.

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:27.377
OK.

01:12:27.411 --> 01:12:30.079
Pastor Dan just asked me out.

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:31.481
(Audrey) That is so weird.

01:12:31.515 --> 01:12:35.184
I can hear ya.
I'm still right here, OK?

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:38.488
Go... go inside and do that.

01:12:38.522 --> 01:12:41.024
(sighs)
Way to go, Pastor Dan.

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:48.064
The guy on stilts
was a great gimmick.

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:50.333
It beats balloons and bunting.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.235
Thank you so much.

01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:55.505
There are a couple of customers
wandering outside.

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:57.507
Focus the wanderers.

01:12:57.541 --> 01:13:00.176
(Helen over PA) Sales associate
to the parking lot, please.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:03.379
Sales associate
to the parking lot.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:07.083
Sales associate?

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:10.319
Leo. The guy on stilts
is looking down my shirt.

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:18.127
Hey! Mini-Me. Watch I don't
break your kneecaps.

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:19.896
(Helen) Think you
can reach them?

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:22.198
Hi. Helen Harris.
Welcome to Massey Motors.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:24.468
Leo Dileo.
Pleasure.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.970
Ahem!
And that's Rene DeCarlo.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:28.404
Hi, Rene.
Hi.

01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:29.973
All right, Leo, let's see

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:33.610
if we can find you something
you like. Follow me.

01:13:33.643 --> 01:13:37.981
You know, I bought a lot
of used cars, but...
Previously owned.

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:39.949
We got a nice silver Volvo
over there.

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:41.951
It's a great family car.
I mean, if you have family.

01:13:41.985 --> 01:13:44.621
Just a rich bachelor.
That's what I thought.

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:47.156
You don't want this one.
Oh, wow.

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:50.293
Oh, I forgot we had this baby.

01:13:50.326 --> 01:13:52.896
I think I know why.
It looks like a jukebox.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.231
Oh, only a handful
of these were made.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:57.300
Earmarked for
special customers only.

01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:59.302
Like in the old days

01:13:59.335 --> 01:14:02.639
when guys like Elvis Presley
and Frank Sinatra

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:05.374
used to special-order their cars
right from the factory.

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:11.981
You're kidding.
Sir, three things
we don't joke about:

01:14:12.015 --> 01:14:16.319
Elvis, Sinatra and Lincolns.

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:19.623
But, like I said, for
special customers only.

01:14:19.656 --> 01:14:23.960
Honey, I own every
hot dog stand in Rockaway.

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:25.328
Not the beach,
but, still, I can afford

01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:29.098
to pay well over sticker
for this. And cash.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:31.300
It's getting a little windy.
Are you sure it's all right?

01:14:31.334 --> 01:14:33.102
(man) Yeah, it's OK.
OK. You sure?

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:36.305
You want a deal
on a previously owned car?
Then come to Massey Motors,

01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:39.142
where you can see me,
Mickey Massey. It's a...

01:14:39.175 --> 01:14:42.045
(groans)
(knocks) Mickey, Mickey.

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:43.880
You're not gonna believe it.
She sold it.

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:52.589
Bye, Leo. Drive safely.

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:55.925
She gets a ham.

01:14:57.594 --> 01:14:59.963
(laughs)

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:01.497
Yes, I did.

01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:04.534
Hey, kids. I'm home.

01:15:04.568 --> 01:15:07.637
Do we have mustard?
I don't know. Why?

01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:13.009
Because we got ham.
I sold a car!

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:16.445
Yay, Aunt Helen!
Go long, Henry, go long!

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:24.187
And she takes him down.
(Helen) Who's got
the pigskin now?

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.255
I don't know.

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:34.163
OK.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:36.499
Hey. What's up?

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:40.203
Hippo's mommy and daddy
are still on vacation.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.612
We're gonna go slice the ham.

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:52.181
I'm the man,
I should slice the ham.
You're no man.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:54.183
They've been gone a long time.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:58.387
That's because they went
really far away.

01:15:58.421 --> 01:16:00.824
Where did they go?

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:06.996
Honey?
Sarah, where did they go?

01:16:08.331 --> 01:16:10.333
Heaven.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:16.572
That's right, sweetie.
That's right.

01:16:16.606 --> 01:16:20.343
And now there's no one
to give him a birthday party.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.580
When's Hippo's birthday?
Now.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:28.918
Now?

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:30.987
Say "Hippo."

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.322
Hippo!

01:16:33.356 --> 01:16:36.826
It's a keeper.
Oh, great.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.929
Vince, thanks again for doing
this on such short notice.

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:42.431
You're sure hanging out
with a new crowd these days.

01:16:42.465 --> 01:16:44.934
Yeah, well, tonight
is a very special night.

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:46.235
You see, it's Hippo's...
Ooh, excuse me.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:49.005
The VIPs. Excuse me.

01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:55.611
Hey, Vince.
We're here to celebrate.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.613
Devon just got
the new Polo campaign.

01:16:57.647 --> 01:17:00.016
Yeah, he's the Ralph Lauren
underwear guy.

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.617
(Vince) Congratulations.

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:04.954
Hey, Devon. Congrats.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:07.623
Are you ready
for your dessert?
Yes, please.

01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:09.993
Can I get you coffee or tea?

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:12.461
Ooh, can I get
a cappuccino, please?

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:14.597
Decaf. And I'll have
a real one.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.366
OK.
And I'll have
a Singapore Sling.

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:22.038
Hey, Jerome. Excuse me, Jerome.

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:24.941
Hi. Do you think you could
sing "Happy Birthday"?

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:29.312
Who's the birthday kid?
Actually,
it's Hippo's birthday.

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:34.483
You want me to sing
to a Hippo?
Yeah.

01:17:34.517 --> 01:17:37.153
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:41.324
All right. What do we got?
Ooh, skulls.

01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:45.194
Another round
of double-cherry
Shirley Temples.

01:17:45.228 --> 01:17:48.564
Oh, no, no. At 12.50 a pop,
I don't think so.

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:50.533
And this is for you, Helen.

01:24:09.112 --> 01:24:12.181
Kids need boundaries.
You know that.

01:24:12.215 --> 01:24:15.251
But, Aunt Helen, it's a big deal

01:24:15.284 --> 01:24:17.586
that a senior asked me
to the prom.

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.589
I mean, what do you want me
to do? Find another senior?

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:23.126
Yes.

01:24:23.159 --> 01:24:25.128
Audrey, I wanna treat you
like an adult,

01:24:25.161 --> 01:24:29.898
but I do not want you to go
to the prom with BZ.

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:33.068
If you go with him,
I'll be very disappointed.

01:24:35.504 --> 01:24:38.641
OK.
OK.

01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:42.311
So, will you help me
find a dress?
Yes, I'll find you a dress.

01:24:42.345 --> 01:24:43.979
OK.

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.449
In the balcony of the church?

01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:48.484
Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

01:24:48.517 --> 01:24:52.555
You are so going to hell.
Hey.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:54.257
Spider!

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:58.361
OK. Cradle.

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:06.435
All right, guys. Shoot.

01:25:06.469 --> 01:25:07.970
Whoo!

01:25:08.003 --> 01:25:10.005
OK. Hit the showers.

01:25:11.507 --> 01:25:14.443
Henry, pick up the balls.

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:20.048
Hey. Gimme one of those.
Come on.

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:27.523
Let's go. Take a shot.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:31.594
Come on. You gotta get
fired up for your game.

01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:34.330
I am. Can't you tell?

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:36.965
(sarcastically) Yahoo.

01:25:36.999 --> 01:25:39.302
Oh, Henry.

01:25:39.335 --> 01:25:42.871
OK. Henry?

01:25:42.905 --> 01:25:44.940
Let's talk.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:48.143
You used to love to play sports.

01:25:48.177 --> 01:25:49.245
Sit down.

01:25:52.215 --> 01:25:54.483
You and your dad
used to play basketball

01:25:54.517 --> 01:25:57.019
till it was too dark
to even see the hoop.

01:25:57.052 --> 01:25:59.488
Even when I missed,
he'd always count it.

01:25:59.522 --> 01:26:03.326
He called it "Giving me
the benefit of the dark."

01:26:06.695 --> 01:26:10.333
It's OK to smile about it.
No, it's not.

01:26:10.366 --> 01:26:13.536
And it's OK to play sports.
No.

01:26:13.569 --> 01:26:16.505
Why?
Because he can't
play anymore.

01:26:16.539 --> 01:26:19.342
Because everyone kept saying
Mom and Dad are up in heaven

01:26:19.375 --> 01:26:21.310
and they're looking
down on us always.

01:26:21.344 --> 01:26:25.314
Well, if he is,
I'm not gonna make him
feel bad about not playing.

01:26:25.348 --> 01:26:27.583
Like if you're having
a good time without him,

01:26:27.616 --> 01:26:30.519
you're rubbing it in?

01:26:30.553 --> 01:26:31.654
Yeah.

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:35.558
Henry. The only thing sadder
than them not being here

01:26:35.591 --> 01:26:37.360
is knowing that
by not being here,

01:26:37.393 --> 01:26:39.895
you're not doing what you love.

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:42.998
They want you to be happy.

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.000
But then it's like
I'm just forgetting them.

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:48.604
No, it's not. No.

01:26:48.637 --> 01:26:51.574
'Cause every time you smile

01:26:51.607 --> 01:26:54.343
or laugh

01:26:54.377 --> 01:26:57.613
or enjoy your life,

01:26:57.646 --> 01:27:00.115
it makes their dreams come true.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.952
Besides, if they are
looking down,

01:27:03.986 --> 01:27:07.290
you really want them to be
stuck watching a lousy game?

01:27:07.323 --> 01:27:10.826
No. My dad hates a lousy game.

01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:22.971
Ooh...

01:27:23.005 --> 01:27:24.573
Come on.

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:28.911
Yeah!

01:27:28.944 --> 01:27:33.148
Yes. I am the senior-class
treasurer. And I just...

01:27:33.181 --> 01:27:34.950
I want to say that
I'm very honored

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:37.320
to be taking Audrey
to my prom tonight.

01:27:37.353 --> 01:27:39.488
I want you to know that.

01:27:39.522 --> 01:27:43.125
Thank you. Breathe.

01:27:43.158 --> 01:27:45.928
Hey. Take a look.
I got a wig on.

01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:49.332
(Audrey) I'm gonna come out now.

01:27:52.335 --> 01:27:54.470
How do I look?

01:27:57.039 --> 01:27:59.508
You look just like your mother.

01:28:03.346 --> 01:28:06.449
Thank you, Peter.

01:28:06.482 --> 01:28:09.485
OK. We're gonna go.
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:28:09.518 --> 01:28:12.621
I wanna... We have
to have a picture.

01:28:12.655 --> 01:28:15.190
OK, get closer. Smile.

01:28:18.527 --> 01:28:21.497
All right, welcome
to the senior prom -

01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:24.266
Bridges of Friendship.

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:25.601
Coming up next: ladies' choice.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:28.837
I hear there's actually
some punch in the vodka.

01:28:28.871 --> 01:28:31.507
(DJ) Guys, your choice later.

01:28:33.542 --> 01:28:37.112
Who is it?
(Dan) Uh, prom king.

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:40.182
(giggles)

01:28:40.215 --> 01:28:42.351
Hey, I thought we could
have our own little prom.

01:28:42.385 --> 01:28:46.021
Where's the little kids at?
They're sleeping.

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:48.991
Doesn't the principal
have to police the prom?

01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:51.860
Don't worry. LaGambina's
looking out for Audrey.

01:28:53.996 --> 01:28:56.399
What is this?

01:28:56.432 --> 01:28:59.468
♪ ("Feels Like Rain" by John Hiatt) ♪

01:28:59.502 --> 01:29:03.005

(phone ringing)

01:29:35.971 --> 01:29:38.474
I should get it.
OK.

01:29:44.413 --> 01:29:47.082
Hello. Hello?

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:48.517
(turns off music)

01:29:48.551 --> 01:29:51.620
What?

01:29:51.654 --> 01:29:55.057
Uh... What? I-I'm sorry.

01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:59.194
Can you hear me now?
Yes. This is Mrs. LaGambina.

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:02.965
Yeah, hi. I don't mean to worry
you, but Audrey's not here.

01:30:02.998 --> 01:30:04.366
She arrived with Peter,

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:06.502
but she seems to have
gone off with BZ.

01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:12.641
I understand.
Thank you for calling.

01:30:12.675 --> 01:30:17.913
Dan. That was the school.
Audrey left the prom with BZ.

01:30:17.946 --> 01:30:19.915
And they overheard some kids
saying that

01:30:19.948 --> 01:30:22.951
BZ was bragging about
taking her to a motel.

01:30:22.985 --> 01:30:25.621
What motel?
They wouldn't say.

01:30:25.654 --> 01:30:29.224
OK. They're gonna tell me.
Just come here.

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.960
I just... It's just
that I knew it.
Don't worry.

01:30:31.994 --> 01:30:34.497
I'll call you from the prom.
Don't worry.

01:30:36.532 --> 01:30:38.033
Audrey.

01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:41.604
(grunts in frustration)

01:30:41.637 --> 01:30:46.475
Ed, do you know that a lot of
celebrities are knitting now?

01:30:46.509 --> 01:30:47.976
Isn't that interesting?

01:30:48.010 --> 01:30:49.945
(phone ringing)
Wow.

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:53.516
Hello.
Ed. It's Helen.

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:57.219
I need Jenny.

01:30:58.887 --> 01:31:00.989
It's Helen.

01:31:01.023 --> 01:31:02.858
Really?

01:31:05.894 --> 01:31:07.530
Hello?

01:31:11.066 --> 01:31:12.601
Hey.
What have you found out?

01:31:12.635 --> 01:31:14.870
Thank you.

01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:16.605
So what do you know?
Nothing yet.

01:31:16.639 --> 01:31:18.140
Dan's at the gym, trying to see

01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:20.509
if he can get something
out of BZ's friends.

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.613
No. Thank you for your time.

01:31:24.647 --> 01:31:27.149
Jenny, we have called
over 20 motels.

01:31:27.182 --> 01:31:29.151
BZ has a car,
he could be anywhere.

01:31:29.184 --> 01:31:32.487
They could be in the middle
of Ronkonkoma for all we know.
Helen...

01:31:32.521 --> 01:31:34.990
Did you let her
have a credit card?
No.

01:31:35.023 --> 01:31:39.194
OK. What about your credit
cards? Check your wallet.

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:41.363
I'm having a banana.

01:31:48.537 --> 01:31:51.173
My Visa's gone.
OK.

01:31:53.075 --> 01:31:55.544
I'm gonna call Visa and check
your recent activity.

01:31:55.578 --> 01:31:58.180
If she's used it,
they'll know where.

01:31:58.213 --> 01:32:01.016
Quite the detective.
No, I'm a mom.

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:06.054
I need your help, Nilma!

01:32:06.088 --> 01:32:07.255
Let me at 'em.
No, no.

01:32:07.289 --> 01:32:10.593
Could you watch Henry and Sarah,
please? I'll explain later.

01:32:10.626 --> 01:32:12.060
(Nilma) Ravi, just watch
the kids.

01:32:12.094 --> 01:32:15.430
I'm going to help Helen
again, OK?

01:32:15.463 --> 01:32:18.200
Look, if you don't tell me,
I'm gonna suspend your asses
so long,

01:32:18.233 --> 01:32:21.369
you're gonna be getting social
security when you graduate.

01:32:21.403 --> 01:32:23.371
Where are they?

01:32:27.409 --> 01:32:29.945
Jenny, I'm sorry you had
to come all the way out.
It's all right.

01:32:29.978 --> 01:32:31.213
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:34.349
(cell phone rings)

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:35.350
Audrey?

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.052
Helen. I know where they are.

01:32:37.085 --> 01:32:40.055
Oh, Dan. So do we.
We're halfway there.

01:32:40.088 --> 01:32:41.389
OK. I'll meet you.

01:32:41.423 --> 01:32:44.026
No, no. This is something
I have to do by myself.

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:46.595
I should come with you.
Dan, please. It's pretty...

01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:49.564
(phone cuts out)
Hello?

01:32:49.598 --> 01:32:51.333
Hello?

01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:58.506
We're getting closer.
It's just down the street.

01:33:00.643 --> 01:33:02.845
(Jenny) There it is.

01:33:09.652 --> 01:33:12.554
(man) I don't know.
I don't know, lady.
(Jenny) Give me the key.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.322
(man) Look, there's laws
against these things.

01:33:14.356 --> 01:33:17.660
(Jenny) There's laws against
renting rooms to minors.
Now gimme the key.

01:33:17.693 --> 01:33:20.462
Hey, I don't want
any trouble, now.
Gimme the key.

01:33:20.495 --> 01:33:22.497
I need that key back.
Don't forget it.

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:24.299
What? Do you think
I wanna live here?

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:27.970
I'd rather sleep in a field,
you crazy man. Come on.

01:33:28.003 --> 01:33:30.839
Now, he said
they're in 205, OK?
OK.

01:33:30.873 --> 01:33:34.076
You gotta go in there,
both guns blazing.
I know.

01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:36.078
Rip 'em a new one, OK?
I know. I got it.

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:40.515
Take charge
and get her outta there.
OK.

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:45.487
(whispering) OK, so just
say "housekeeping"
or something.

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:49.191
Get the door open.

01:33:49.224 --> 01:33:51.326
I can't do it.

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:54.129
What?
I can't do this.

01:33:54.162 --> 01:33:56.364
I can't go in there.
She's gonna hate me.

01:33:56.398 --> 01:33:59.101
She's gonna hate you
if you don't.

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:01.136
I can't do it.

01:34:01.169 --> 01:34:04.506
Jenny, I'm not you, OK?
I can't do it.

01:34:08.243 --> 01:34:11.313
Please, just... Please.

01:34:12.681 --> 01:34:14.549
OK. OK.

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:19.321
(knocks)

01:34:19.354 --> 01:34:22.190
Housekeeping.
We're already asleep.

01:34:22.224 --> 01:34:24.026
Could you come back
in the morning, please?

01:34:34.569 --> 01:34:36.671
Aunt Jenny?
What are you doing here?
How did you find...

01:34:36.705 --> 01:34:41.009
You have ten seconds
to get your things together
and get in the car.

01:34:41.043 --> 01:34:43.645
Stay! Ten...

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:46.314
You're not my mother,
if you haven't noticed.

01:34:46.348 --> 01:34:48.350
No. But I love you very much

01:34:48.383 --> 01:34:53.555
and I will be your worst
nightmare if you don't
get in that car now!

01:34:53.588 --> 01:34:57.592
Seven, six...
But we're not ready
to go yet.

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:59.594
Oh, you're not ready?

01:34:59.627 --> 01:35:01.997
Well... Well, are you
ready for this?

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:06.068
I don't think so.
Are you ready to be a parent?

01:35:06.101 --> 01:35:08.203
I don't think so!

01:35:08.236 --> 01:35:09.938
Four,

01:35:09.972 --> 01:35:12.507
three...

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:16.178
Are you happy?
You just ruined my entire life.

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:18.881
Well, we'll fix it later.

01:35:18.914 --> 01:35:21.116
Two...

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:25.220
You!
Chill out, Mommy.

01:35:25.253 --> 01:35:27.122
Hey.
It's all good.

01:35:27.155 --> 01:35:30.926
Don't you talk to me
like that.
It's just prom.

01:35:30.959 --> 01:35:32.928
You listen to me.

01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:37.365
If you ever so much as blink
in her direction again,

01:35:37.399 --> 01:35:42.237
I can and will bury you
so far in the ground

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:44.206
that the heat
from the earth's core

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:46.474
will incinerate your sorry ass!

01:35:46.508 --> 01:35:50.012
Do you understand me?
Yes, ma'am.

01:35:54.516 --> 01:35:58.653
By the way,
you're not a bad person,

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:02.157
but this is very bad behavior.

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:05.027
Very bad behavior.

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:25.180
(Audrey, crying) Go away!

01:36:25.213 --> 01:36:27.615
I'm never speaking
to either of you.

01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:30.518
She's gonna be fine.
She's gonna be just fine.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:35.257
It was so nice to meet you.
And thank you for your help.

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:38.994
Sure.
So. Come here.

01:36:41.696 --> 01:36:45.567
So I'll just come pack up
the kids in the morning,
and, um...

01:36:47.235 --> 01:36:49.905
You're doing the right thing.

01:36:52.074 --> 01:36:54.309
You are.

01:36:54.342 --> 01:36:55.310
OK.

01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:01.149
So good night.

01:37:02.918 --> 01:37:04.987
Good night, Jenny.

01:37:11.927 --> 01:37:14.262
You want me to make you
a cup of tea?

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:18.600
No, thanks.

01:37:20.435 --> 01:37:23.205
I think it would be best for me
if you just go.

01:37:25.007 --> 01:37:27.175
Why?

01:37:27.209 --> 01:37:30.145
I'm not a mom.

01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:34.316
I'm not girlfriend material.
I'm not brave.

01:37:34.349 --> 01:37:37.052
I'm not anything you need.

01:37:37.085 --> 01:37:39.654
Hey, Helen.
No, please.

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.389
Don't.

01:37:41.423 --> 01:37:43.558
Please, Dan.

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:56.238
(door opens/closes)

01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:09.417
OK. So, then, if you wanna
come on Sunday, great,

01:38:09.451 --> 01:38:11.853
and you just figure that out.
All right.

01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:14.256
And then say good-bye
to the kids.

01:38:17.926 --> 01:38:21.463
Hey. You make sure Hippo
has a night-light,

01:38:21.496 --> 01:38:23.831
so he doesn't get scared
in the dark, OK?

01:38:29.137 --> 01:38:31.506
Henry.
Don't worry about it.

01:38:33.675 --> 01:38:34.842
OK.

01:38:38.981 --> 01:38:41.216
I know you're mad.

01:38:41.249 --> 01:38:44.486
I'd be mad too.

01:38:44.519 --> 01:38:47.355
But, really, Audrey,
I'm only thinking of you.

01:38:49.024 --> 01:38:51.493
I got you guys something.

01:38:51.526 --> 01:38:55.297
I thought you might like it.

01:38:55.330 --> 01:38:58.833
Oh, that's darling.

01:38:58.866 --> 01:39:00.868
OK, say good-bye to Helen.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:33.935
Ibsen wrote, "Not all women
are meant to be mothers."

01:39:33.968 --> 01:39:35.537
And I have to say,
I agree with him.

01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:38.040
Fashion and family do not mix.

01:39:38.073 --> 01:39:41.309
But, you know,
there can be exceptions.

01:39:41.343 --> 01:39:43.611
Exceptions?

01:39:43.645 --> 01:39:46.614
Would you like some tea?
No, thank you.

01:39:46.648 --> 01:39:49.017
Exceptions like...?

01:39:49.051 --> 01:39:51.353
Tinka.

01:39:51.386 --> 01:39:53.355
Tinka.

01:39:53.388 --> 01:39:56.024
She wants you to be her agent,
of all things.

01:39:56.058 --> 01:40:00.862
And, as she is one of our
biggest earners right now,
well...

01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:04.366
I want you back.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.002
♪ ("Thinking Over" by Dana Glover) ♪

01:40:08.036 --> 01:40:10.672
Press on this thing.
Makes that big boom sound.

01:40:10.705 --> 01:40:14.008
Softer. OK? Softer.
Thanks.

01:40:15.277 --> 01:40:19.414
And I'm running out of time

01:40:19.447 --> 01:40:23.585
I can feel that it's the season

01:40:23.618 --> 01:40:27.322
It's time to make up my mind

01:40:27.355 --> 01:40:31.926
And I can't really tell you
what I'm gonna do

01:40:31.959 --> 01:40:36.164
There are so many thoughts
in my head

01:40:36.198 --> 01:40:39.000
There are two roads to walk down

01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:41.002
and one road to choose

01:40:41.035 --> 01:40:44.206
So I'm thinking over
the things that you've said

01:40:44.239 --> 01:40:48.009
I'm thinking over the things

01:40:48.042 --> 01:40:49.511
Hey, Helen.
Hey.

01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:52.046
You calling it a night
or want to go eat?

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.516
Oh, no, I'm just gonna go home.

01:40:54.549 --> 01:40:56.518
Thinking over

01:40:56.551 --> 01:40:58.586
Thinking over

Thinking over the things

01:41:02.457 --> 01:41:05.127
I'm thinking over

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.462
Thinking over

01:41:07.495 --> 01:41:11.866
Thinking over the things

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:16.138
Am I ready for forever?

01:41:16.171 --> 01:41:20.308
Oh, God, show me a sign

01:41:20.342 --> 01:41:24.912
'Cause if we're to be together

01:41:24.946 --> 01:41:28.450
Then it's got to be divine

01:41:28.483 --> 01:41:30.952
And I can't really tell ya

01:41:30.985 --> 01:41:33.155
What I'm gonna do

01:41:33.188 --> 01:41:37.225
'Cause there are so many
thoughts in my head

There are two roads to walk down

01:41:39.661 --> 01:41:41.996

Thinking over the things
that you've said

And I'm thinking over

01:42:02.116 --> 01:42:03.951
Thinking over

01:42:03.985 --> 01:42:06.254
Only you know

01:42:06.288 --> 01:42:10.858
If he's the one for me

01:42:12.394 --> 01:42:16.364
So many thoughts in my head

01:42:16.398 --> 01:42:19.000
There are two roads to walk down

01:42:19.033 --> 01:42:21.002

01:42:21.035 --> 01:42:24.406
I'm thinking over

01:42:29.644 --> 01:42:34.316
(man on TV) Mm-mm.
Smells like sunshine.

01:42:34.349 --> 01:42:36.318
Hi, I'm Mickey Massey.

01:42:36.351 --> 01:42:38.320
Um... I've been married
for a long time now,

01:42:38.353 --> 01:42:40.388
but my wife and I don't
have any children,

01:42:40.422 --> 01:42:44.025
so my cars became my babies.

01:42:44.058 --> 01:42:46.328
I know. That sounds obsessive.

01:42:46.361 --> 01:42:48.129
But you don't know
the joy I feel

01:42:48.162 --> 01:42:50.064
when I find them a good home.

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:52.900
I mean, look at these beauties.
What's not to love?

01:42:52.934 --> 01:42:54.202
Massey Motors. Come visit us.

01:42:54.236 --> 01:42:58.172
I love my cars.
And you will, too.

01:42:58.206 --> 01:43:00.908
(man #2) Massey Motors.
In Queens.

01:43:02.377 --> 01:43:06.013
(announcer) Now back to
the Saturday six o'clock movie.

01:43:11.386 --> 01:43:13.988
(phone rings)
Phone call, Mr. Massey.

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:15.323
It's your wife.

01:43:15.357 --> 01:43:17.925
Thank you. Thank you, Sharon.
Hello, Diane.

01:43:17.959 --> 01:43:21.496
Oh, please.
I look like I always do.

01:43:21.529 --> 01:43:24.266
Good night, Tim.
Thank you very much.

01:43:24.299 --> 01:43:26.934
Sure I will...
Hold on a minute.

01:43:26.968 --> 01:43:29.504
Hi.
Helen, you've come
back to work.

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:30.838
Oh, no. No.

01:43:30.872 --> 01:43:34.242
Mickey, I need to borrow a car
desperately. It's an emergency.

01:43:34.276 --> 01:43:37.412
Sure. Use one of
the test drives.
OK.

01:43:37.445 --> 01:43:40.181
Hey, you were great on TV.

01:43:40.214 --> 01:43:42.950
Oh, sure, I looked great,
but did I sell any cars?

01:43:42.984 --> 01:43:44.252
I'm sorry.

01:43:44.286 --> 01:43:45.953
Eddie, I need this car.

01:43:45.987 --> 01:43:47.955
You can't take this car.
This is Mr. Massey's...

01:43:47.989 --> 01:43:50.091
I know, but it's the only one
with a full tank of gas.

01:43:50.124 --> 01:43:51.926
I have to go.

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:54.962
What movie star did
I look like? Well...

01:43:56.464 --> 01:43:59.334
(Mickey, over PA) Helen,
I think you misunderstood.

01:44:20.522 --> 01:44:23.925
Ed! Ed, who do we know
with a Jaguar?

01:44:23.958 --> 01:44:26.328
Could be a celebrity
coming to knit with you.

01:44:26.361 --> 01:44:28.229
(dog barks)
Origami, Origami. Shh.

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:31.165
(doorbell)
Origami.

01:44:32.534 --> 01:44:33.568
Helen.

01:44:33.601 --> 01:44:35.937
I'm here for my kids.

01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:38.340
OK. I'm listening.

01:44:42.644 --> 01:44:44.612
I don't even know who I am
anymore without them.

01:44:44.646 --> 01:44:47.615
I need them
and I want them back.

01:44:47.649 --> 01:44:50.017
OK, let me see if I've got that.

01:44:50.051 --> 01:44:53.855
You need them
because you want them,

01:44:53.888 --> 01:44:57.992
because you don't know
who you are without them.

01:44:59.361 --> 01:45:03.264
See, all I'm hearing
is "you, you, you."

01:45:03.297 --> 01:45:07.001
But this can't be about you.
It has to be about them.

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:10.338
What don't you understand?
I love those kids.

01:45:10.372 --> 01:45:12.940
Whether or not you love them
was never the question.

01:45:12.974 --> 01:45:16.878
It was whether or not
you could raise them.

01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:19.881
The power to take the kids back
is yours.

01:45:19.914 --> 01:45:23.317
This is not a power struggle
between you and me.

01:45:23.351 --> 01:45:25.887
This is me asking you

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:29.391
to do the right thing
for everyone.

01:45:29.424 --> 01:45:31.292
The kids aren't packed.

01:45:31.325 --> 01:45:34.228
It's too late for them to go
anywhere tonight, anyway.

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:37.164
Ed, can you let Origami out?

01:45:38.433 --> 01:45:41.335
Come on. The bases are loaded.
Jeter's up.

01:45:43.371 --> 01:45:46.207
(Origami barks)
I'll be right back.

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:50.011
Ed! I mean, don't you hear him?

01:45:50.044 --> 01:45:51.846
Hi!

01:45:51.879 --> 01:45:54.248
Ohh! (laughs)

01:45:54.281 --> 01:45:58.520
Hey, Henry, Audrey.
I miss you guys.

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:03.057
You guys heard all that?
Yeah, we did.

01:46:03.090 --> 01:46:07.061
Hey, you left Irwin back
at our place. Why?

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:09.330
It's not really Irwin.

01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:12.366
My Irwin had a skull
and crossbones

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.201
that I drew on his stomach.

01:46:14.235 --> 01:46:17.238
Why didn't you say something?

01:46:17.271 --> 01:46:19.507
Seemed you didn't
want me to know.

01:46:19.541 --> 01:46:23.344
Sarah, honey, why don't you
go play with turtle

01:46:23.377 --> 01:46:25.913
and figure out a name for him?

01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:30.518
I just couldn't stand
the idea of you

01:46:30.552 --> 01:46:34.355
losing something else
you cared so much about.

01:46:34.388 --> 01:46:37.091
Can I put him in a bowl?

01:46:43.898 --> 01:46:47.001
Sarah, you wanna help
Henry with the turtle?

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:50.972
Can I name him Hippo?

01:46:51.005 --> 01:46:53.441
Why do you want
to name everything Hippo?

01:46:53.475 --> 01:46:56.478
Because I can spell it.

01:46:56.511 --> 01:46:58.112
Audrey, sweetie,
can you do me a favor

01:46:58.145 --> 01:47:00.982
and get me your wallet?

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.251
Why?

01:47:04.285 --> 01:47:06.488
Could you just do it, please?

01:47:14.028 --> 01:47:15.930
Open it up and
give me your fake ID.

01:47:17.198 --> 01:47:18.232
Why?

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:20.968
Because I said so, that's why.

01:47:21.002 --> 01:47:25.507
I'm not gonna give it to you.
I'm not a child.

01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:27.509
Yes, you are.

01:47:27.542 --> 01:47:30.144
You are a child, Audrey,

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:31.513
and you have a right
to a childhood

01:47:31.546 --> 01:47:32.647
and you should fight for it.

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:36.283
But if you won't, then I will.
Now, give me your ID.

01:47:43.224 --> 01:47:45.993
That was very adult of you.

01:47:46.027 --> 01:47:48.596
You tricked me.

01:47:48.630 --> 01:47:51.432
I thought you were on my side,
but you're just like her!

01:47:51.465 --> 01:47:53.601
I hate you.

01:47:53.635 --> 01:47:57.004
Do you hear me? I hate you!

01:47:58.973 --> 01:48:00.875
Well,

01:48:00.908 --> 01:48:03.377
I'm just gonna have
to live with that.

01:48:21.495 --> 01:48:25.166
Well, we don't have to
decide this tonight.

01:49:57.925 --> 01:50:01.162
(gasps) Oh, Jenny.
What are you doing?

01:50:01.195 --> 01:50:04.832
At first, I didn't agree
with this letter,

01:50:04.866 --> 01:50:05.833
but...

01:50:10.337 --> 01:50:12.139
Sit down.

01:50:12.173 --> 01:50:16.477
No, I think I'll swing.
In fact, you know what they say?

01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:20.481
What?
It's not over till
the fat lady swings.

01:50:21.615 --> 01:50:23.885
See? I can make a joke.

01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:42.303
"Dear Jenny,

01:50:42.336 --> 01:50:46.440
if you're reading this,
you know that I'm gone,

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:50.644
and I asked Helen to be
the guardian for the kids."

01:50:50.678 --> 01:50:54.982
(Lindsay's voice)
"And you're probably
freaked about it.

01:50:55.016 --> 01:50:57.852
"Yes, it's a surprising choice,

01:50:57.885 --> 01:51:02.890
considering that you are
the most incredible mother
I've ever known.

01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.495
"If you find this letter odd,

01:51:08.529 --> 01:51:13.134
understand that my
always-be-prepared Paul

01:51:13.167 --> 01:51:17.872
convinced me to write it now,
while our children are young.

01:51:22.043 --> 01:51:24.245
(Sarah makes popping sound)

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:31.518
"You must know from experience

01:51:31.552 --> 01:51:33.187
that when it comes to
picking somebody else

01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:37.524
to raise your kids,
no one seems right.

01:51:37.558 --> 01:51:39.360
"No one is you.

01:51:43.097 --> 01:51:46.000
(mouths)

01:51:46.033 --> 01:51:50.071
"And so you choose someone
who is most like you.

01:51:50.104 --> 01:51:52.940
(mouths)

01:51:52.974 --> 01:51:57.211
"Someone that will give the
kids a taste of their real mom.

01:51:57.244 --> 01:52:01.448
"The mom they lost
and never really got to know.

01:52:01.482 --> 01:52:05.152
"In so many ways,
we are so much alike.

01:52:08.089 --> 01:52:10.557
"That's why I chose Helen.

01:52:10.591 --> 01:52:13.928
They're all yours.

01:52:13.961 --> 01:52:17.064
"Of course, she'll have lots
of fights with the kids,

01:52:17.098 --> 01:52:20.134
yet she'll find a way
to make up.

01:52:22.937 --> 01:52:25.272
Welcome to the mamahood.

01:52:25.306 --> 01:52:27.942
"I know sometimes
she messes things up

01:52:27.975 --> 01:52:29.476
"and makes big mistakes.

01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:33.580
"On the other hand,
she also makes big comebacks.

01:52:33.614 --> 01:52:36.217
"Respect her, Jenny.
Give her a shot.

01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:39.053
"We're family,
and I'm counting on you

01:52:39.086 --> 01:52:41.588
to keep everyone together.

01:52:43.124 --> 01:52:46.560
"I know Helen
will certainly need some help

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:49.997
learning how to be
a mother to my kids...

01:52:51.465 --> 01:52:53.968
but I've got you for that,

01:52:54.001 --> 01:52:56.303
and who could be better?"

01:52:57.004 --> 01:52:58.305
OK.

01:52:59.974 --> 01:53:04.011
"After all, you raised Helen.

01:53:04.045 --> 01:53:06.147
"You'll teach her
how to be a mom.

01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:09.350
"Just like you taught her
how to tie her shoes.

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:13.187
"I can still hear you
telling her:

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:18.192
The bunny goes around
the tree and into the burrow."

01:53:21.996 --> 01:53:23.164
Pull tight.

01:53:26.233 --> 01:53:30.137
Yes!
