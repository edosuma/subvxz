Cobalt was the biggest

silver producer
in the world,

02:46.266 --> 02:49.433
pulling out millions
of ounces every year.

deposits were discovered here,

08:39.166 --> 08:41.033
It's likely lead babbit from
one of the mills that

08:41.166 --> 08:42.800
burnt down in the Cobalt area.

08:42.934 --> 08:44.600
Lot of people think
it's silver, but it's not.

08:44.734 --> 08:46.367
I thought it was silver.
It's lead?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.800
- Yeah, it's lead.
- So, it's like a 1.23 a pound.

08:48.934 --> 08:52.200
Yeah, it's not worth a
whole hell of a lot right now.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.934
Obviously, that has all kinds
of product from a fire.

08:55.066 --> 08:57.000
I can see a nail,
charcoal in there.

08:57.133 --> 08:59.033
You look closely,
maybe under a microscope,

08:59.166 --> 09:00.667
you'll probably find a
whole bunch of other things.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.500
What's the shiny stuff?
It looks like silver.

09:02.633 --> 09:04.100
- Nah, she's lead.
- Alright.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.467
Not worth as much as
the box, here.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.834
It's unfortunate, but...

09:07.967 --> 09:08.867
Well, it's not worth much,

09:09.000 --> 09:10.567
but it's still great
history piece for me.

09:10.700 --> 09:11.533
I love it.

09:11.667 --> 09:12.667
You want to see
something really cool?

09:12.800 --> 09:16.033
I do. I'm in.
I'm in, brother, let's go.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.767
- Cool place, man.
- Yeah.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.734
It's got a lot of history
in it, that's for sure.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.667
Been around since
1914, this place.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.467
- Seriously?
- So...

09:23.600 --> 09:26.000
- What's this?
- That's a bullion furnace.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.233
That is cool.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.967
That's actually the
original one that was

09:29.100 --> 09:30.834
in operation by the government.

09:30.967 --> 09:33.433
It was set up for
the small scale mine,

09:33.567 --> 09:35.567
and juniors and prospectors.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.934
In the day, that's how rich
the silver deposits were.

09:38.066 --> 09:40.367
One could just take a
hammer or a chisel,

09:40.500 --> 09:43.400
or a drill, and peel it
off the walls, underground.

09:43.533 --> 09:46.467
They used to bring it here
and you smelt it into bars.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.667
Silver bar,
like a big hunk?

09:47.800 --> 09:50.033
Yeah, you pour it into a bar -
500, 1000-ounce bars.

09:50.166 --> 09:51.567
1000-ounce bar?!

09:51.700 --> 09:53.200
Yes, 1000-ounce bars,
that's correct.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.900
Anywhere between 18
and 20 bars in a day.

09:56.033 --> 09:59.266
They poured the silver into
moulds like this, right here.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.500
And then, you could
take that to a buyer,

10:01.633 --> 10:03.867
in most cases, a bank,
walk across the street and

10:04.000 --> 10:05.166
get cold, hard cash.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.934
That'd be like
a good day, eh?

10:07.066 --> 10:08.133
Oh, man.

10:08.266 --> 10:09.867
After Ted wraps up
with Gino,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.533
he hustles back to
join the guys at

10:11.667 --> 10:12.800
the MacMillan building.

10:12.934 --> 10:14.800
They're well into their
first day of salvage,

10:14.934 --> 10:18.133
and have a long way to go
to hit their $10,000 target.

10:18.266 --> 10:19.767
There is so much
stuff back here.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.567
Finding stuff
all over the place!

10:21.700 --> 10:23.867
- It's loaded, isn't it?
- Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.700

10:31.233 --> 10:33.367
Is that ever cool, eh?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
This stuff is waterlogged.
Look at this.

10:35.633 --> 10:38.166
Look at this, man.
Look at that.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.400
- Oh, man, what is that?
- It's a Petty hood ornament.

10:40.533 --> 10:42.300
- Really?
- Is that ever sweet?

10:42.433 --> 10:45.834
Nash got Petty to design
these hood ornaments.

10:45.967 --> 10:47.467
It's a flying goddess.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.266
The flying goddess hood
ornament was designed by

10:50.400 --> 10:52.567
famed pinup artist,
George Petty,

10:52.700 --> 10:54.166
and his designs were
featured on many

10:54.300 --> 10:56.633
Nash vehicles into the 1950s.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.533
The Petty Girl made her
debut in 1933 in

10:59.667 --> 11:02.100
Esquire Magazine's
very first issue.

11:02.233 --> 11:04.367
During the second World War,
they became popular

11:04.500 --> 11:06.734
on war planes, including
the famous bomber,

11:06.867 --> 11:09.000
Memphis Belle.

11:09.133 --> 11:10.166
What do you
think that's worth?

11:10.300 --> 11:13.166
- So, I'd say 75 bucks.
- 75 bucks?

11:13.300 --> 11:14.233
200 bucks.

11:14.367 --> 11:15.700

Okay, fine. We'll start
loading the trailer.

seriously amazing.

16:50.834 --> 16:52.867
I could stay here
for days salvaging,

16:53.000 --> 16:57.700

gonna fly with Ryan.

16:57.834 --> 17:00.667
They've got one last stop
before leaving Cobalt:

17:00.800 --> 17:02.333
they promised to
meet the mayor

17:02.467 --> 17:04.200
at the town's iconic
train station.

17:04.333 --> 17:05.934
- Mr. Mayor?
- Yes.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.367
- How's things, brother?
- Hey, well. Good.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.800
- This is a beautiful building.
- Yeah, fantastic.

17:11.934 --> 17:14.233
Cobalt Station
was built in 1910.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.233
It was designed by John M. Lyle,

17:16.367 --> 17:19.600
who was also the architect
behind Toronto's Union Station.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.600
In its prime, Thomas Edison,

17:21.734 --> 17:23.800
Canadian Prime Minister
Sir Wilfred Laurier,

17:23.934 --> 17:26.834
and even the Prince of Wales,
crossed its platforms.

17:26.967 --> 17:29.233
The station ceased
operating in 2012,

17:29.367 --> 17:32.734
but has since been designated
as a heritage building.

17:32.867 --> 17:34.467
The mayor has asked Ted
to help clear out

17:34.600 --> 17:36.233
what he can from what
was left behind by the

17:36.367 --> 17:38.900
building's previous owners.

that is, the weight?

that went through here.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.667
$15 million.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.133
Twice as much silver came
out of Cobalt during the

17:54.266 --> 17:56.266
silver rush as
gold came out of

17:56.400 --> 17:58.467
the Klondike during
their gold rush.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.200
So, what is the
story here, mayor?

18:01.333 --> 18:02.467
Story is, is...

18:02.600 --> 18:05.400

25:06.900 --> 25:08.233
the more collecting
he's done.

25:08.367 --> 25:09.633
His barn's, like, full.

25:09.767 --> 25:11.734
He has more toys
than anything else.

25:11.867 --> 25:14.300
Like, there isn't one open
shelf in that whole place.

25:14.433 --> 25:15.834
It's just full of stuff.

25:15.967 --> 25:17.667
Over here is Wyandotte,
and then,

25:17.800 --> 25:19.200
down at the end,
Lincoln toys.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.600
These are Ertl Trucks, and
these are Little Beaver,

25:21.734 --> 25:23.333
which is kind of funny
'cause all they are is

25:23.467 --> 25:25.567
Tonka trucks made for Canada.

25:25.700 --> 25:27.633
The toys
started 20 years ago.

25:27.767 --> 25:29.467
Fellow that worked for me,
he had some diecast

25:29.600 --> 25:32.834
construction toys and
he wanted to move away and,

25:32.967 --> 25:34.567
I bought his
little collection.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.100
They're all Structo toys
on this whole wall.

25:37.233 --> 25:39.667
Some of them actually
have engines in them.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.800
There's probably
3,000 toys in here.

25:41.934 --> 25:43.867
I've never actually counted;
that's just a guess.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.400
Bunch of fire trucks,
trains, matchbox toys.

25:48.533 --> 25:50.567
Here's about
1000 Hot Wheels.

25:50.700 --> 25:53.200
My grandpa does let me play
with his toys sometimes....

25:53.333 --> 25:55.667
The rules are mostly,
don't touch if it's on a shelf.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.633
Agricultural equipment toys.

25:57.767 --> 26:00.600
John Deere on the
right and the left.

26:00.734 --> 26:03.233
When I was really young,
I'd go into his old office and

26:03.367 --> 26:04.967
he'd have tractors
along the top.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.734
And I'd ask him to play
with them after camp.

26:06.867 --> 26:09.300
Those are all from
Castle Building Supplies.

26:09.433 --> 26:11.266
This is all
Home Hardware toys.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.533
Canadian Tire trucks here.
More farm tractors.

26:14.667 --> 26:16.600
London bus.
That's about it.

26:16.734 --> 26:18.200
He brought me into it
as a kid:

26:18.333 --> 26:20.400
buying, selling,
keeping, collecting,

26:20.533 --> 26:22.433
fixing, restoring,
whatever it is.

26:22.567 --> 26:23.967
So, it's just something
that's in my blood.

26:24.100 --> 26:26.800
I share the same
passion as he does.

26:26.934 --> 26:28.700
The cool thing about this
is that we found it at

26:28.834 --> 26:31.567
an old Nash Dealership.
So, it might not look great,

26:31.700 --> 26:33.200
but there's a cool
story behind it.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.533
The body's nice,
minus the rust on it.

26:35.667 --> 26:36.767
Like, there isn't
too much body damage.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.133
Well, these cars
don't have a frame though.

26:38.266 --> 26:39.367
They're called a unibody.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.200
If there's one person that
knows about these old cars,

26:41.333 --> 26:42.266
it's my grandpa.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.834
He's been collecting them
for years and he'll

26:43.967 --> 26:46.033
definitely be able to tell me
exactly what it's worth.

26:46.166 --> 26:47.533

41:49.934 --> 41:51.467
What year was the one
that your family had?

41:51.600 --> 41:52.734
I'm pretty sure
it was a '52.

41:52.867 --> 41:54.767
I think it was this
very car, actually.

41:54.900 --> 41:55.900
That's incredible.

41:56.033 --> 41:57.166
I remember the
fold-down seats.

41:57.300 --> 41:59.934
I remember, in 1954,
in Hurricane Hazel,

42:00.133 --> 42:03.166
we drove over in this Nash
to pick our relatives up and

42:03.300 --> 42:06.433
bring them back and,
we got stuck.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.100
The water was right up to
the running boards

42:08.233 --> 42:09.567
on the thing and it stalled.

42:09.700 --> 42:11.133
My uncle was with us
and he said,

42:11.266 --> 42:13.000
"Do you have a
fire extinguisher?"

42:13.133 --> 42:15.767
Sprayed all the wires and
the darn thing started,

42:15.900 --> 42:17.066
and we drove home.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.533
It's absolutely stunning how the
chrome has been maintained.

42:20.667 --> 42:21.667
- It hasn't been redone.
- No, it's definitely original.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.033
It's probably
double, triple coated.

42:24.166 --> 42:26.567
Like, we don't even
hardly have chrome anymore.

42:26.700 --> 42:27.734
What's it look
like under the hood?

42:27.867 --> 42:29.934
- Can you lift that?
- I can, yes.

42:30.066 --> 42:33.133
♪

42:33.266 --> 42:36.433
There you go.
So, the engine's still there.

42:36.567 --> 42:38.400
It's rough.
It's a skeleton, for sure.

42:38.533 --> 42:40.467
Definitely, but the
skeleton's in good shape,

42:40.600 --> 42:41.533
which is what matters.

42:41.667 --> 42:44.600
- Yeah. Bullet hole.
- Yeah. Free of charge.

42:44.734 --> 42:48.100
- So, what do you think?
- What's the number?

42:48.233 --> 42:50.533
- I'd like 18.
- (exhales)

42:50.667 --> 42:53.133
Well, we got it up in Cobalt.
We pushed it on the trailer,

42:53.266 --> 42:55.166
we trailered it
all the way back.

42:55.300 --> 42:56.633
I know it's
sentimental value,

42:56.767 --> 42:58.633
but we've got a bit of
work into getting it here.

42:58.767 --> 43:01.100
You couldn't get 18 in
Cobalt either, I bet.

43:01.233 --> 43:05.433
It requires 5 in the
motor, 5, interior,

43:05.567 --> 43:08.934
5,000 for glass,
5,000 just to do the metal over.

43:09.066 --> 43:10.934
And, another 5 to finish it.

43:11.066 --> 43:12.367
You'd never get
your money out.

43:12.500 --> 43:13.934
No one would do this,

43:14.066 --> 43:16.667
but it's sentimental
to me... so...

43:16.800 --> 43:18.567
- Of course.
- I would pay...

43:18.700 --> 43:21.033
...1000 for it, for sure.
1800's crazy.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.133
1000?

43:22.266 --> 43:24.433
Well, it requires
so much work.

43:24.567 --> 43:29.333
Well, could we meet
in the middle and do 14?

43:29.467 --> 43:32.734
- That's still too high. 12.
- 12...

43:32.867 --> 43:35.333
Okay, just 'cause you're
friends with my grandpa,

43:35.467 --> 43:37.333
and because I've
known you for so long,

43:37.467 --> 43:38.767
I think we can do 12.

43:38.900 --> 43:40.266
Done deal,
thank you very much.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.467
Thank you very much.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.967
He's not his grandfather,
but he's a Priestly, for sure.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.166
(laughs)

43:45.300 --> 43:46.900
I don't know
what my wife might say.

43:47.033 --> 43:48.967
She wanted a second car.

43:49.100 --> 43:51.000
Selling this Nash was
another first for me.

43:51.133 --> 43:53.166
Found the car,
trailered it home,

43:53.300 --> 43:55.133
and then made a
sale for it after.

43:55.266 --> 43:57.900
With this sale, I put us
over the target for Cobalt.

43:58.033 --> 43:59.633
I am no longer the rookie.

43:59.767 --> 44:03.200
I'll be happy to see it on
your lawn and not on ours.

44:03.333 --> 44:04.800
Excellent.
