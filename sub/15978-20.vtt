WEBVTT

00:04.105 --> 00:05.773
(sighs)
We're going out to eat.

00:05.806 --> 00:09.343
Debbie's three bean casserole
just fell off the counter.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.745
Did it fall, Mother?
Or was it pushed?

00:11.779 --> 00:14.715
It probably jumped. I-It was
looking pretty miserable.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.450
Either way,

00:16.484 --> 00:18.619
we're going out for dinner.
Whose turn is it to pick?

00:18.652 --> 00:19.720
Dad, you're up.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.422
Finally.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.790
McGee's Chinese.

00:22.823 --> 00:26.427
No, not McGee's Chinese.
I hate their nachos.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.564
Well, I want Chinese. I've had
a craving for Chinese...

00:30.598 --> 00:32.300
Oh, you know what, Tom?
Zito's has

00:32.333 --> 00:34.068
a Chinese chicken salad
and they deliver.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.736
I'm gonna call 'em.
I don't want salad.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.139
Oh, Tom, just order
spaghetti without sauce

00:38.172 --> 00:40.308
and eat it with
two forks upside down.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.410
That's practically Chinese.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.078
But I wanted to go out.
No,

00:44.112 --> 00:45.613
Dad, going out is a hassle.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.781
So let's just decide
what you want and shout it out.

00:47.815 --> 00:51.552
McGee's Chinese!

00:51.585 --> 00:54.355
Oh. Oh, hey, wait, I just found
some buckwheat tofu patties.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.124
We can just reheat...

00:57.358 --> 01:00.060
Well, I guess I could
just clean these up...

01:09.770 --> 01:11.772
I'll call Zito's.
Yeah, that's good. Good.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.435
Hey, sugar bear.
(laughs)
Fun.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.670
Hey, Nate,
exciting news.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.338
I finally got on the same
bathroom schedule

01:44.372 --> 01:46.174
as Ed Dolan. And it paid off.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.742
Who's Ed Dolan?
Oh, he's the guy
who owns our station.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.911
You met him at the Christmas
party, Mom. He was the guy who

01:50.944 --> 01:53.814
kept going up to people saying,
"Kiss me, I own the station."

01:55.283 --> 01:57.251
Chatted him up
through the stall.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.686
He invited us over
to pitch a show.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.254
That's great, man.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.223
Wait, you're not gonna
pitch him that show about

02:02.256 --> 02:05.459
the globe-trotting
gynecologist, right?
(chuckles)

02:05.493 --> 02:08.496
Vagina Travelogues?
Come on, man.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.764
I'm saving that gold
for the Oprah network.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.534
What Dolan's looking for

02:13.567 --> 02:15.269
is a Saturday morning
kids show.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.705
Ray, I can't pitch him
a kids show.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.208
I need him to see me
as a serious newsman.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.510
Right now I'm just the guy
that they send out every time

02:22.543 --> 02:25.546
two animals of a different
species befriend each other.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.682
But Nathan, you inspired
so many people with your story

02:28.716 --> 02:30.751
about the sloth and the turtle.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.653
"They may move slow,

02:32.686 --> 02:36.624
"But they became fast friends."
but they became
fast friends."

02:36.657 --> 02:38.526
Look, I didn't say I wasn't
good at it. The... ju...

02:38.559 --> 02:40.928
The point is I need Dolan
to see me in a different light

02:40.961 --> 02:43.464
if I'm ever gonna get promoted
to doing the serious news.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.966
Come on, Nate. I need
you for this, man.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.468
In a business meeting
it never hurts

02:47.501 --> 02:49.437
to have a white guy
sitting next to you.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.673
Every time you want to go to
that soul food restaurant in DC,

02:52.706 --> 02:55.243
I always go with you.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.344
You owe me, man.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.579
Well, I guess if we
come up with a good enough idea,

02:58.612 --> 03:01.515
I could use the opportunity
to maybe show Mr. Dolan

03:01.549 --> 03:04.252
I'm more than just
a fluff-news reporter.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.419
All right, I'm in.

03:05.453 --> 03:08.322
Thanks, man. Mm.
(chuckles)

03:08.356 --> 03:11.725
Aw. You two are like
the sloth and the turtle.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.427
I hope not exactly.
Well, four months

03:13.461 --> 03:16.464
after that story, an adorable
litter of slurtles was born.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.705
Okay, guys, you're looking
for some kids show ideas.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.341
I got a box
full of 'em.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.411
Who's ready for some good
old-fashioned edutainment?

03:30.444 --> 03:32.813
Let's see what you got, Carol.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.316
(English accent):
Hello, boys and girls.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.651
My name is Professor Pencil.

03:37.685 --> 03:41.289
I'm sorry I'm late, but it
took me a little while to...

03:41.322 --> 03:42.623
get the lead out.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.759
But let me get
right to the...

03:45.793 --> 03:47.361
point.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.431
I'm here to sharpen your minds.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.566
Can you guys
not hear me?

03:54.302 --> 03:55.503
Oh, we can hear you.

03:55.536 --> 03:58.906
I-I-Is your show idea
just a... just a pencil?

03:58.939 --> 04:01.475
It's a pencil with glasses
and a dry British wit.

04:01.509 --> 04:04.945
Which would be great if we were
dealing with dry British kids.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.880
But these kids are wet
and American.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.016
You got to put sunglasses on
that pencil and give it a sassy

04:09.049 --> 04:11.952
catch phrase. Like, uh, uh, uh,

04:11.985 --> 04:13.987
"Who you calling 'Number Two?'"

04:20.027 --> 04:23.831
Relax, I'm just getting started.

04:23.864 --> 04:28.469
(Mexican accent):
Hola, me llamo
es Professora Pencil.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.605
I'm sorry I'm so tardy, but it
took me a little while to...

04:31.639 --> 04:32.940
get the lead out.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.544
What is wrong with you guys?
Don't you know it's unhealthy

04:36.577 --> 04:38.779
for you to hold in
laughter like this?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.648
Mom, you just took
the same character

04:40.681 --> 04:42.550
and made it a different
stereotype.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.652
Let me see who else
I've got in here.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.953
Maybe you should
hold off, Carol.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.621
I can't promise
how calm I'm gonna stay

04:47.655 --> 04:49.657
if your next character's
a black Sharpie.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.529
Nate, Ray, if you like
the idea of puppets,

04:55.563 --> 04:57.698
Debbie and I actually know how
to make our own therapy puppets

04:57.731 --> 04:59.633
from a couples counseling
retreat we went on.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.869
DEBBIE:
So we can make you
original ones, or

05:01.902 --> 05:04.104
you could save
a little time and money

05:04.137 --> 05:06.574
by doing a show about...

05:06.607 --> 05:09.510
a beautiful petite redhead

05:09.543 --> 05:10.844
who gets a little too honest

05:10.878 --> 05:13.647
after having more than
one glass of wine.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.883
And her handsome husband

05:15.916 --> 05:18.118
who really regrets
vacationing in wine country.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.555
(laughs) Oh, well.
If I was a loud talker,

05:21.589 --> 05:23.791
I would want to know.
(chuckles)

05:23.824 --> 05:25.659
Well, sometimes you
have to talk loudly

05:25.693 --> 05:28.562
to be heard over the
sound of slurring.
(laughs)

05:28.596 --> 05:31.465
Starting to miss
that racist pencil.

05:32.766 --> 05:36.504
Hey, grandpa, why don't you tell
them about your made-up world?

05:36.537 --> 05:38.506
Oh, Mikayla, they're
not gonna be interested

05:38.539 --> 05:40.073
in that silly little story.

05:40.107 --> 05:43.911
But it's so cool. I would love
to see a show about that.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.879
Dad, what's she talking about?
What made-up world?

05:45.913 --> 05:48.616
(chuckles) You don't want
to hear about it, it's stupid.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.650
Come on, Dad.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.853
Come on, remember,
there are no stupid ideas...

05:52.886 --> 05:54.588
left. Mom took 'em all.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.926
Well...

05:58.959 --> 06:01.829
You guys know I've always
been into comic books.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.997
And over the years
I started imagining

06:04.031 --> 06:05.799
what my comic world would be.

06:05.833 --> 06:09.403
And it just, uh,
it kind of grew.

06:09.437 --> 06:12.973
It all started
with a character named Tom.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.543
One fateful day, Tom and Wilma,

06:15.576 --> 06:17.545
his flying pet warthog,

06:17.578 --> 06:19.880
were forced to leave
their planet in a hurry...

06:19.913 --> 06:21.649
(boom)

06:21.682 --> 06:25.586
...and search the galaxy
for a new place to call home.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.922
Unfortunately, as the only
human on this new planet,

06:28.956 --> 06:30.824
Tom was seen as a freak.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.192
NATHAN'S VOICE:
What is that thing?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.428
It doesn't even have
any fur or feathers.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.629
DEBBIE'S VOICE:
And no tail.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.765
Just a lumpy, misshapen
excuse for a butt.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.867
ADAM'S VOICE:
And why is it on
its hind legs,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.702
exposing its
vulnerable organs?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.937
TOM:
Sensing the power structure
had shifted,

06:43.971 --> 06:45.639
even Wilma turned on him.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.140
CAROL'S VOICE:
You should
see him naked.

06:47.174 --> 06:50.177
It looks like a tower
of old tapioca pudding.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.046
Get the hell
out of here, you freak.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.750
TOM: Tom was banished,
forced to watch as Wilma
(smacking, thumping)

06:56.784 --> 07:00.120
became more and more
crazed with power.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.790
She terrorized the land.

07:02.823 --> 07:06.159
Till one day, when Tom
was struck by lightning.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.629
(thunder, electric crackling)

07:08.662 --> 07:11.599
He was transformed
into Tom Tom,

07:11.632 --> 07:13.967
protector of the animals.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.036
Tom Tom stood up to Wilma.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.071
And from the mountains
to the valleys,

07:18.105 --> 07:19.840
the animals rejoiced.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.575
DEBBIE'S VOICE:
Peace has been restored!

07:21.609 --> 07:23.544
ADAM'S VOICE:
Wilma has been defeated!

07:23.577 --> 07:24.945
NATHAN'S VOICE:
Let's hear it for Tom Tom!

07:24.978 --> 07:27.648
A hero so nice, they
named him twice.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.650
All right!
Hooray!

07:29.683 --> 07:32.986
TOM:
And they renamed
their planet Tomlandia.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.755
RAY'S VOICE:
In honor of Tom Tom,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.624
the baddest superhero
to ever appear

07:36.657 --> 07:38.225
on greater Washington, DC

07:38.258 --> 07:40.594
Saturday morning
local television. (laughs)

07:40.628 --> 07:42.195
And-And, uh, you know,

07:42.229 --> 07:43.764
the characters are
all based on members

07:43.797 --> 07:45.132
of my family, so there's
something for everyone.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.801
There's a cute lemur
for the girls, and a...

07:47.835 --> 07:50.804
a handsome, athletic, uh,
peacock for the boys

07:50.838 --> 07:53.273
and even this weird,
sort of nerdy giraffe

07:53.306 --> 07:56.710
for those weird kids that nobody
wants to sit next to at lunch.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.713
I got one of those kids at home.

07:59.747 --> 08:00.981
Oh, uh, well, I was...

08:01.014 --> 08:02.783
I was only joking.
I... I didn't...

08:02.816 --> 08:04.652
Oh, no, no. Don't worry
about it. He's not my kid.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.086
He came with the marriage.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.022
Odd little fella.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.792
Eats anything he can
get his hands on.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.995
Paper, dirt, chalk.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.730
Half of my favorite tie.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.832
Okay, well, um,

08:18.866 --> 08:20.668
as you can see from
the stories, uh, each week

08:20.701 --> 08:22.035
we'll just take the kids
on an adventure

08:22.069 --> 08:24.838
and-and Tom Tom
will save the day.
Hey, listen, here's the deal:

08:24.872 --> 08:27.174
I just need something
to keep my wife's kid

08:27.207 --> 08:30.143
from bothering us
before 7:00am on Saturdays.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.846
My-My wife and I enjoy
early morning hanky-panky,

08:32.880 --> 08:34.915
and it's just hard,
you know? To get...

08:34.948 --> 08:37.751
sexy with a nine-year-old just

08:37.785 --> 08:41.755
gnawing at a condom wrapper
at the foot of your bed.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.557
Well, we'll definitely
give you a show

08:43.591 --> 08:45.893
where you can have some
hanky-panky, and-and, uh, we...

08:45.926 --> 08:47.294
we can make it
an hour long.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.529
If you can make it
an hour long.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.200
Uh, make it a half hour.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.836
I don't like to take two pills.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.906
All right, um,
I like the show, and, um...

08:58.939 --> 09:01.575
I want to do a test
episode of this.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.777
Beca... Provided you guys
are okay with a...

09:03.811 --> 09:05.713
couple of tweaks.
Absolutely.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.014
Anything.
Okay, well, first,

09:07.047 --> 09:08.048
let's make it
more educational

09:08.081 --> 09:10.884
so my wife will let
the kid watch it. And then...

09:10.918 --> 09:14.187
Uh, you know, let's throw out
the whole superhero thing.

09:14.221 --> 09:18.358
You know, kids really need
real heroes like, uh,

09:18.391 --> 09:21.795
oh, firemen and stepdads
who honor their commitments

09:21.829 --> 09:24.064
even though they got misled.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.666
Look at us,
collaborating,

09:25.699 --> 09:28.135
I love it.
Yeah. And I-I don't
want a show with just,

09:28.168 --> 09:30.337
uh puppets, you know.
I want, uh...

09:30.370 --> 09:31.905
I-I want a human host.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.174
Miller, this is perfect for you.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.944
Sir, I-I appreciate it,
but I just...

09:36.977 --> 09:39.046
I don't think that
this job is for me.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.915
Oh, you're telling the boss
"no." I admire your confidence.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.317
That, uh, that reminds
me a lot of Jenkins.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.352
Who?

09:45.385 --> 09:47.688
Exactly.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.957
Got it, yeah. You know what,
let's do it your way.
Fabulous,

09:49.990 --> 09:52.025
fabulous. I can't wait
to get started, guys.

09:52.059 --> 09:55.195
I know what
you're gonna say.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.131
Oh, that I was hoping that
one day that guy was gonna
make me the next Tom Brokaw,

09:58.165 --> 09:59.266
not the next Captain Kangaroo?

09:59.299 --> 10:00.734
Don't worry.
(short laugh)

10:00.768 --> 10:03.070
We're gonna make sure
you look cool and sleek.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.105
(chuckles)
But still fun for kids.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.808
Like-Like James Bond
driving the Batmobile.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.810
Uh, Miller, head
down to costumes

10:09.843 --> 10:12.179
and, uh, get fitted
for a hat and overalls.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.247
My wife's kid loves farmers.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.849
Least I hope he does.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.951
He asked for a pitchfork
for his birthday.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.996
Maybe if I just refuse
to host the kids show,

10:29.029 --> 10:31.665
uh, Dolan will have
more respect for me.

10:31.699 --> 10:32.866
Like that stripper I once saw

10:32.900 --> 10:34.702
who refused to take her
clothes off.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.203
Every guy there
wanted to marry her.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.305
Weren't you the only guy there?

10:39.339 --> 10:41.975
She impressed me.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.012
Look, what-what's Dolan
gonna do, fire me?

10:45.045 --> 10:47.047
I mean, it's not
the end of the world.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.016
Uh, could be the
end of our world.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.384
Yeah, and-and what would you do?
Where would you work?

10:51.418 --> 10:53.687
How would you pay
the majority of our bills?

10:53.721 --> 10:55.689
RAY:
Come on, Nate.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.124
Think about me.
This is my big break.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.793
I got a dream of being
a millionaire before I turn 30,

10:59.827 --> 11:01.862
and I don't want to be
over 13 years wrong.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.932
I think you're
overestimating

11:04.965 --> 11:06.700
how much money we can make
in kids TV.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.968
Are kidding me?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.202
Look at this.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.738
It's the Taj Mahal.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.172
No, it's a replica
of the Taj Mahal

11:12.205 --> 11:15.242
that one of the Wiggles built
for his mother in Phoenix.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.110
Come on, Nathan.
You'd be great at this.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.879
Fine. I'll do it.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.914
But if-if we're gonna do this,
though, I want to do it well.

11:20.948 --> 11:21.982
CAROL:
Great.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.851
And if your boss wants the show

11:23.884 --> 11:25.252
to be more educational,
I can help.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.954
It's no coincidence

11:26.987 --> 11:29.990
that America's academic rankings
had gone down

11:30.023 --> 11:32.860
every year
since I stopped teaching.

11:32.893 --> 11:36.797
Poland is ahead of us in
math, science and reading.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.799
Poland!

11:38.832 --> 11:41.835
Some of our best jokes
don't even make sense anymore.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.940
(crowd murmuring)

11:46.974 --> 11:48.508
This is so exciting.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.378
Tomlandia is actually
coming to life.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.347
Hey!

11:54.381 --> 11:57.084
Oh, uh, I'm sorry
about that. Here.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.386
Here's $100, and try to keep it
away from his mouth.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.024
(upbeat, folksy, instrumental
music plays, featuring violin)

12:04.057 --> 12:05.458
(whistling)

12:05.492 --> 12:07.160
Well, hello.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.062
I didn't see you there.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.130
Did you see you there?

12:10.163 --> 12:12.132
ALL:
No!

12:12.165 --> 12:15.002
Well, you should be able
to see you here

12:15.035 --> 12:16.469
on the farmer cam.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.038
CHILDREN:
Oh!

12:18.071 --> 12:20.140
(Nathan laughs)

12:20.173 --> 12:21.909
That's right.
WOMAN:
Ah.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.978
Now, come with me as we journey
to Tomlandia.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.346
Why is Nathan
a farmer?

12:26.379 --> 12:27.981
There's no farm
in Tomlandia.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.950
It's a self-sustaining
ecosystem.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.886
We had to make
a few changes.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.421
What kind of pig knows karate?

12:34.454 --> 12:35.989
(slide whistle plays)

12:36.023 --> 12:37.157
Pork Chops.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.391
(laughter)

12:38.425 --> 12:40.060
And I resent that.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.395
Well, it's-it's
Wilma Warthog.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.031
(laughter)

12:44.064 --> 12:47.067
Why is she so pretty? And
where are all the warts?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.969
I'm sorry, Tom.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.038
No matter what species
you make me,

12:51.071 --> 12:54.942
good bone structure is
good bone structure.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.911
Wilma, it wasn't very nice
of you to steal my punch line.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.312
No. In fact, it was very...

12:59.346 --> 13:00.914
Ugh!

13:00.948 --> 13:02.415
Now, what's the word
I'm looking for?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.583
(slide whistle plays)
Well, greetings

13:03.616 --> 13:06.086
and good morning, Farmer Nate.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.155
I believe the word
of the day you're looking for

13:08.188 --> 13:09.589
is disrespectful.

13:09.622 --> 13:14.027
Carol, why is there a
talking wiener on stage?

13:14.061 --> 13:16.930
That's a not a wiener.
That's a bookworm.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.498
Though he does look
a little weird

13:18.531 --> 13:20.968
when he stands between
those two boulders.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.839
That's the character
who has all the answers.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.341
Tom Tom has
all the answers.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.910
(slide whistle plays)

13:29.943 --> 13:31.144
(laughter)

13:31.178 --> 13:33.180
Well, hey, there, Tom Tom.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.083
What do you think about
people being disrespectful?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.885
Duh. I don't know.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.886
I'm too distracted

13:38.919 --> 13:42.022
by these yummy-looking
meatballs on the ground.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.523
(laughter)

13:43.556 --> 13:46.526
Oh! Oh, that's a rock.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.528
(laughter)

13:48.561 --> 13:50.097
Why is he acting
so stupid?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.099
Tom Tom is
a superhero.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.167
Superheroes are a fad.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.269
Stupid is forever.
(sighs)

13:56.303 --> 13:59.539
TOM TOM:
Duh. Hey, there's another
meatball down on the ground.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.174
(munching)

14:01.208 --> 14:04.377
Oh. Oh, that's a pinecone.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.380
TOM:
With Tom Tom stripped
of his superpowers,

14:07.414 --> 14:10.550
Wilma the Warthog once again
terrorized the citizens

14:10.583 --> 14:13.320
of what was once Tomlandia.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.156
Tom Tom, you'll have to think
of a way to save us!

14:16.189 --> 14:18.525
TOM:
Since Tom was too stupid
to think of an answer,

14:18.558 --> 14:20.994
their only hope
was an intelligent wiener.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.930
I know exactly how
to save the day.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.231
All you have to do is...

14:25.632 --> 14:28.135
(cackling)

14:28.168 --> 14:31.538
No!

14:31.571 --> 14:33.273
Tom Tom's not an idiot!

14:33.306 --> 14:35.242
He's a superhero!

14:35.275 --> 14:37.577
Dad, what are you doing? My boss
is right out there. Cool it!

14:37.610 --> 14:40.380
This is my world, and you guys
aren't gonna change it.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.416
Those eyebrows look
like two slugs!

14:43.450 --> 14:45.618
Stupid wiener!

14:47.054 --> 14:49.622
Talk about disrespectful, huh?

14:49.656 --> 14:51.458
(folksy music plays)

14:53.326 --> 14:56.496
Oh, wow. We got a real
cliffhanger here.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.332
I can't wait to see
what happens next, man,

14:59.366 --> 15:02.669
which is, uh...
which is, um...

15:02.702 --> 15:04.704
(Ray mutters)

15:04.737 --> 15:06.573
Hello, boys and girls.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.675
I'm Professor Pencil.

15:08.708 --> 15:12.545
I'm sorry I'm late, but
it took me a little while to...

15:12.579 --> 15:14.414
get the lead out.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.418
Get the lead out.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.222
Get the lead out.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.567
Dad, step away from that
shredder and unlock this door.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.336
I need to get those puppets!

15:36.369 --> 15:38.405
I'm sorry, Nathan,
but I have to stop you guys

15:38.438 --> 15:40.273
from doing this to me,
like you always do!

15:40.307 --> 15:42.509
Oh, we're always ruining
your made-up world

15:42.542 --> 15:44.044
with inaccurate puppet shows?

15:44.077 --> 15:46.579
'Cause it kind of feels
like the first time to me.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.081
No!

15:51.551 --> 15:54.087
(children screaming)

15:54.121 --> 15:56.023
Oh, oh, it's okay, kids.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.357
Surprise twist.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.226
Mr. Giraffe was evil.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.427
The end.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.461
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't touch it.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.996
The-the kid digs it.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.398
Feed it more!

16:05.432 --> 16:08.635
Dad, stop! Look, I-I'm sorry
that we made some changes,

16:08.668 --> 16:11.471
but that's no reason
to start a puppet genocide.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.306
It's not that big of a deal.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.243
Maybe not to you, but for me,
this was just one more example

16:16.276 --> 16:17.710
of this family
pushing me around!

16:17.744 --> 16:19.479
What are you talking about?

16:19.512 --> 16:21.581
Do you think
I wanted to be an engineer?

16:21.614 --> 16:22.682
I didn't want that much stress
in my life,

16:22.715 --> 16:25.518
but your mother thought
I needed to earn more money.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.355
So I had to give up my dream
of putting on a badge.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.522
You wanted to be a cop?

16:29.556 --> 16:30.557
A mall cop.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.195
It's got none of the danger
of being a real cop,

16:35.228 --> 16:36.329
but all of the respect.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.265
Debatable.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.634
But your mother laughed,
and said my dream was stupid.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.671
Yeah. Well...

16:44.704 --> 16:47.374
Who's laughing now, Wilma?!

16:47.407 --> 16:48.575
No! No! D-Dad, stop!

16:48.608 --> 16:50.443
(whirring)

16:51.411 --> 16:53.113
(children screaming)

16:53.146 --> 16:55.615
Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat!

16:55.648 --> 16:58.518
Do you think
I wanted to spend my weekends

16:58.551 --> 17:02.655
driving you and your sister
to hockey or gymnastics?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.491
No! I wanted
to go bird watching!

17:04.524 --> 17:06.593
The closest I ever came
was getting into a fight

17:06.626 --> 17:08.661
with a pigeon over a bag
of Doritos

17:08.695 --> 17:10.530
in an ice rink parking lot!

17:10.563 --> 17:12.299
Dad, not me!

17:12.332 --> 17:14.734
(whirring)

17:14.767 --> 17:16.403
(children screaming)

17:16.436 --> 17:19.106
What the hell is going on
up there?

17:19.139 --> 17:20.540
For the past 40 years,

17:20.573 --> 17:22.842
I've done what everyone else
wanted me to do.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.744
What profession to be,

17:24.777 --> 17:26.679
what vacations to take,
where I want to eat,

17:26.713 --> 17:28.681
what movie I want to see.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.251
Even when I wanted
to name you kids.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.585
I wasn't supposed
to be Nathan?

17:32.619 --> 17:35.122
No, you weren't, Mork.

17:41.261 --> 17:45.665
I know. Everyone thinks
it's a silly, made-up world,

17:45.698 --> 17:47.534
but Tomlandia was a piece of me

17:47.567 --> 17:51.304
that was exactly
how I wanted it to be.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.672
And I'm not crazy.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.542
And I understand that being
a man means being there

17:55.575 --> 17:58.178
for the people you love,
and I'm glad I did it.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.613
But at certain point, you...

18:00.647 --> 18:02.282
you sacrifice so much,

18:02.315 --> 18:04.351
it doesn't feel like yourself
anymore.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.119
It feels like...

18:06.153 --> 18:09.256
I don't know.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.692
Feel like a guy wearing
overalls, kids TV show?

18:12.725 --> 18:14.594
Yeah.

18:14.627 --> 18:15.528
I get it, Dad.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.730
Think I'm kind of
doing the same thing.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.203
I just wanted to help Ray,
and then,

18:23.236 --> 18:24.604
Adam, Debbie and Mom
got involved,

18:24.637 --> 18:26.539
and I just didn't want
to let everyone down.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.540
Hmm.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.608
I don't want to do this.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.210
But I also don't
want to end up

18:30.243 --> 18:31.578
resenting everyone
because I did.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.712
Then don't.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.714
You got to do
what's best for you,

18:34.747 --> 18:37.484
or else that resentment
will just build up,

18:37.517 --> 18:40.787
and you'll end up holding
puppets hostage at a kids show.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.690
Which is a huge
adrenaline rush, by the way.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.725
Hmm.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.903
(whirring)

18:59.272 --> 19:01.241
(children screaming)

19:01.274 --> 19:02.442
Kids, look over here!

19:02.475 --> 19:04.444
We're the Black Man Group.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.479
(drumming rhythmically)

19:14.721 --> 19:17.357
(girl crying)

19:17.390 --> 19:18.558
You're both monsters.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.760
Monsters!
Well...

19:20.793 --> 19:22.495
Mr. Dolan, I'm so sorry.
I know this show

19:22.529 --> 19:23.663
was a disaster.

19:23.696 --> 19:24.831
Are you... are
you kidding?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.267
We found the show.
My kid loved it.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.203
Seriously? 'Cause, sir,
I don't think that I could...

19:30.237 --> 19:31.604
No, not you.
He hated you.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.207
I want to do a show
about the shredder.

19:34.241 --> 19:37.310
It's magic. He... he hasn't
eaten anything in an hour.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.450
Half hour.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.320
Well, uh, look,
I'm-I'm just glad

19:47.354 --> 19:48.988
that it worked out
for everyone.

19:49.021 --> 19:49.856
I'm-I'm glad it worked out

19:49.889 --> 19:52.325
between you and your
dad. That was great.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.994
Really?
Yeah. I-I watched
you on farm cam,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.730
and you stayed calm, you
asked the right questions.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.400
And you stayed right in it

20:00.433 --> 20:02.735
until you figured
out the real story.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.571
That's what a good
reporter does.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.873
You're in the
right business.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.909
Thank you, sir.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.645
Well, I guess Debbie
and I aren't gonna get rich

20:12.679 --> 20:14.314
off of puppet toys
after all.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.715
I don't know
about you guys,

20:15.748 --> 20:18.251
but all that shredding
reminded me of cheese.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.252
Let's go eat.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.288
You know, Nate, I think
it's your turn to pick.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.724
I want to eat
wherever Dad wants to eat.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.025
McGee's Chinese!

20:26.058 --> 20:29.729
Nobody does a better
sweet and sour corned beef.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.431
Grandpa, when we get home,

20:31.464 --> 20:33.433
can you tell me more
about Tomlandia?

20:33.466 --> 20:34.701
The good version,

20:34.734 --> 20:36.903
not the crappy,
made-for-TV version?

20:36.936 --> 20:38.371
No offense.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.707
You all
did your best.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.275
Of course, sweetie,
I'd love to

20:42.309 --> 20:45.745
after we all go to McGee's
Frozen Yogurt for dessert.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.914
They have fortune cookies here.
There's no reason to go...

20:47.947 --> 20:49.549
It's my night, Wilma.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.584
My night.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.788
(indistinct conversation)

20:55.822 --> 20:58.391
TOM:
Now that order was restored
in Tomlandia,

20:58.425 --> 21:00.327
the citizens were free
to celebrate.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.697
And when Tom Tom ate
four ice cream cones,

21:04.731 --> 21:06.699
he was once again a hero.
