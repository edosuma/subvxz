Announcer: IT'S BEEN
A DEFENSIVE STRUGGLE ALL DAY
BETWEEN THESE 2 TEAMS.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.500
YOU'RE RIGHT. THE PENTHOUSE
DOES HAVE THE BEST TV
IN THE HOTEL.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.900
AND 413 HAS THE BEST BATHROOM.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.700
THERE WAS SCHOOL TODAY?

01:26.767 --> 01:28.967
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A LONG WEEKEND.

01:28.967 --> 01:31.734
IT'S WEDNESDAY.

01:31.734 --> 01:35.200
OH! SO IT'S ALMOST
THE WEEKEND AGAIN.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.700
WELL, NO POINT
IN GOING NOW.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.667
LONDON, I HAVE A MESSAGE
FROM YOUR FATHER.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.667
HE IS OUTRAGED BY
YOUR POOR ATTENDANCE
RECORD AT SCHOOL.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.200
HOW DID HE FIND OUT?

01:45.200 --> 01:49.000
HE WENT TO YOUR
SCHOOL OPEN HOUSE AND
THEY'D NEVER HEARD OF YOU.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.300
DADDY WENT TO OPEN HOUSE?

01:52.300 --> 01:53.600
HE DOES CARE.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.567
HE CARES SO MUCH THAT HE'S
HAVING YOU TRANSFERRED

01:56.567 --> 01:58.400
TO OUR LADY
OF PERPETUAL SORROW.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.667
THAT'S FUNNY.
MY SCHOOL'S THE SAME NAME.

02:01.667 --> 02:04.100
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.500
OH! OH! [SOBBING]

02:09.400 --> 02:12.834
YOU MEAN, I HAVE
TO WEAR...PLAID

02:12.834 --> 02:14.300
3 DAYS A WEEK?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.900
SCHOOL IS 5 DAYS A WEEK.

02:15.900 --> 02:19.400
THIS JUST GETS
WORSE AND WORSE.

02:20.667 --> 02:25.000
GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE BONDING.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.767
WELL, AT LEAST
IT WASN'T THE WHOLE WALL.

02:30.767 --> 02:33.934
JUST BE GLAD
I'M NOT CHARGING THEM
WITH BREAKING AND ENTERING.

02:33.934 --> 02:38.467
ACTUALLY, IT WOULD
BE BREAKING AND ENTERING
AND THEN BREAKING.

02:38.467 --> 02:42.233
BUT I THINK IT IS
A VERY GOOD IDEA TO HAVE
THE BOYS REPAIR THE DAMAGE.

02:42.233 --> 02:43.200
OH!

02:43.200 --> 02:44.200
OH!

THEY'RE LATE.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.500
PLEASE, SIR.
I DON'T TELL YOU
HOW TO RUN YOUR HOTEL.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.033
YOU DON'T TELL ME
HOW TO RUN MY CREW.

OH, DON'T WORRY, CAREY.
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL,
I WAS A PHI BETA HAMMA.

ARE YOU
EYEBALLING ME, BOY?

03:36.133 --> 03:39.000
SORRY. I'M JUST KIDDING.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THAT.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.567
OK, NOW, YOU'RE HERE
TO FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS.

03:42.567 --> 03:45.133
SO DO EVERYTHING I DO

04:07.300 --> 04:09.300
SO, THIS IS THE CAFETERIA.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.767
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR BREAKFAST, LONDON?

04:11.767 --> 04:12.867
LONDON?

04:12.867 --> 04:14.600
I LOOK HORRIBLE.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.867
WE'RE ALL WEARING
THE SAME THING.

04:17.867 --> 04:21.000
YOU LOOK
HORRIBLE, TOO.

04:22.233 --> 04:26.300
NO! NO! NO!
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

04:28.600 --> 04:30.700
THIS IS WHERE YOU EAT?

04:30.700 --> 04:34.133
WHERE ARE THE TABLECLOTHS,
THE CANDLES, THE STRING QUARTET?

04:34.133 --> 04:35.700
YOU HAD A STRING QUARTET
AT YOUR SCHOOL?

04:35.700 --> 04:39.100
FOR BREAKFAST. AT LUNCH
IT WAS THE PHILHARMONIC.

04:39.100 --> 04:42.467
OH. TABLE FOR 2. SOMETHING
WITH A VIEW, PLEASE.

04:42.467 --> 04:45.400
CERTAINLY. WHY DON'T YOU
SIT AT TABLE 1?

04:45.400 --> 04:48.200
IT HAS A LOVELY VIEW
OF TABLE 2.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.800
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.934
NO, NO. [GASPS]

04:53.934 --> 04:56.200
I'M SORRY, SISTER.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.934
PLEASE EXCUSE MY FRIEND.

04:57.934 --> 04:59.667
SHE'S NEW HERE
AND DOESN'T GET IT.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.500
WELL, I'M MAKING IT
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

05:02.500 --> 05:04.500
TO MAKE SURE
SHE DOES GET IT.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.500
GOT IT?

05:05.500 --> 05:07.000
GOT IT. GOT IT?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.667
GOT IT.
WHAT'D I GET?

05:09.667 --> 05:10.834
OH!

05:21.600 --> 05:24.500
NO. I'LL TAKE
AN EGG WHITE OMELET

05:24.500 --> 05:26.667
WITH TOMATOES, SHALLOTS,
AND CRUMBLED FETA.

05:26.667 --> 05:30.767
OH, AND INSTEAD
OF SLICING THE TOMATOES,
COULD YOU DICE THEM?

05:33.867 --> 05:37.300
WHY DID THAT MAN
PUT CEMENT ON MY TRAY?

05:38.667 --> 05:41.000
THIS IS JUST LIKE PRISON,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.467
ONLY THE OUTFITS ARE WORSE.

05:43.467 --> 05:45.700
HI, GUYS.
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET...

05:45.700 --> 05:46.934

05:46.934 --> 05:49.133
I CAN'T BELIEVE
LONDON TIPTON'S
IN OUR CAFETERIA.

05:49.133 --> 05:51.400
ME NEITHER.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.600
I JUST MET
LONDON TIPTON.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.233
I MET HER MONTHS AGO.
BELIEVE ME, THE THRILL
WEARS OFF.

05:56.233 --> 05:58.300
OH, WELL. THEN I GUESS
I'M NOT INVITING YOU

05:58.300 --> 06:00.100
TO THE BANDINI
FASHION SHOW TODAY.

06:00.100 --> 06:03.900
THE THRILL IS BACK.
YOU WANNA BE BEST FRIENDS?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.133
I MADE A FRIEND
IN PRISON.

06:10.033 --> 06:13.300
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
IN ORDER TO PROPERLY
REPLASTER THIS WALL,

06:13.300 --> 06:17.100
IRONICALLY, WE MUST
FIRST MAKE THIS HOLE
SLIGHTLY BIGGER.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.967
ALL RIGHT!

06:22.500 --> 06:23.934
NOT THAT BIG.

06:23.934 --> 06:26.767
WE'RE GONNA NEED
MORE PLASTER.

06:26.767 --> 06:28.834
LUCKILY, MOTHER GOT ME
SOME FOR CHRISTMAS.

06:28.834 --> 06:32.200
WHAT'D SHE GET YOU

06:32.200 --> 06:34.033
NO.

06:34.033 --> 06:36.033

06:40.667 --> 06:42.233
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.

06:42.233 --> 06:44.033
LISTEN.

06:44.033 --> 06:47.000
YOU DON'T TELL ME
HOW TO FIX THINGS,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.300
AND I WON'T TELL YOU
HOW TO BOIL A PHEASANT.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.567
YOU DON'T BOIL IT.
YOU BRAISE IT.

06:53.567 --> 06:57.033
OH, MY GOSH.
I BROKE THROUGH
TO THE NEXT ROOM.

06:57.033 --> 06:59.834
THERE'S A GIRL'S
SOCCER TEAM IN THERE.

06:59.834 --> 07:02.767
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
NEXT DOOR AND SAY HELLO.

07:04.667 --> 07:07.400
"MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
NEXT DOOR AND SAY HELLO."

07:09.200 --> 07:12.967
ZACK, YOU CAN'T SPY
ON THEM. IT'S WRONG.

07:12.967 --> 07:16.500
HAVEN'T YOU
ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT A GIRL REALLY THINKS,

07:16.500 --> 07:18.700
WHAT THEY REALLY WANT,

07:18.700 --> 07:20.867
WHAT THEY REALLY TALK ABOUT?

07:20.867 --> 07:23.200
SO YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE?

07:23.200 --> 07:25.834
ONLY IN THE INTEREST
OF SCIENCE.

07:25.834 --> 07:29.300
WELL, I DO LOVE SCIENCE.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.200
INCOMING!

07:44.600 --> 07:46.400
I MEAN, IT'S LUNCHTIME.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.567

IS MADE A BIGGER HOLE.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.700
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EAT WITH US, ARWIN.

07:57.700 --> 08:00.834
IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU HAVE
TO SPEND ALL DAY WITH US.

08:00.834 --> 08:03.700
THAT'S OK.
I LOVE SPENDING TIME
WITH MY CREW.

08:04.767 --> 08:07.700

FOR MY MOM.

YOU MEAN TO ME.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.200
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID.

09:12.200 --> 09:12.900
SHUT UP.
