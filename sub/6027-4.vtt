00:10.660 --> 00:12.640
Why is my brother still a suspect?

00:13.593 --> 00:14.852
Is that all of it?

00:14.853 --> 00:16.033
Do you think I kept a piece?

00:16.117 --> 00:18.557
This has one number one it - mine.

00:18.558 --> 00:20.758
Don't tell anyone you have these.

00:22.027 --> 00:23.106
No!

00:23.107 --> 00:27.147
'Police have a suspect in custody, a Russian
national named 'as Anya Lutvchenko.'

00:27.232 --> 00:28.231
Anya!

00:28.232 --> 00:30.932
He is the beating heart of all of
this, and if we can find his

00:30.984 --> 00:33.743
identity, it ends, and you go home.

00:33.744 --> 00:36.304
'That's who Mr Rabbit is.'

00:42.984 --> 00:44.743
Shut her up!

00:44.744 --> 00:46.183
Ian, is she OK?

00:46.184 --> 00:48.383
Please, stop her screaming, now!

00:48.384 --> 00:51.262
I can't stop her screaming, Wilson,
she's lost her fucking mind!

00:51.263 --> 00:54.784
Stop her screaming or I will
drive this van into a fucking wall!

01:13.544 --> 01:15.463
I'm not saying we dump her!

01:15.464 --> 01:17.342
What are you saying then,
Wilson?

01:17.343 --> 01:18.822
- I'm saying we can't look after her!
- Shhht!

01:18.823 --> 01:21.182
She must have grandparents, or
relatives.

01:21.183 --> 01:22.742
Why are you even saying that?

01:22.743 --> 01:24.262
You know they'll be there waiting,

01:24.263 --> 01:26.822
if we go within a million miles of
her family.

01:26.823 --> 01:28.342
So what's your big idea, Becky?

01:28.343 --> 01:30.182
I don't fucking have one, shithead!

01:30.183 --> 01:32.262
Couldn't we just leave her
somewhere,

01:32.263 --> 01:33.982
like a police station or
a hospital?

01:33.983 --> 01:36.102
You might as well put
a bullet in her head right now.

01:36.103 --> 01:37.622
Are you suggesting shooting her?

01:37.623 --> 01:40.024
Of course I'm not - what
the fuck is the matter with you?

01:40.025 --> 01:42.183
All right, pack it in!

01:42.184 --> 01:43.903
We...

01:43.904 --> 01:47.102
we have to take her with us.
It's the only thing we can do.

01:47.103 --> 01:48.342
No, look, just call Milner.

01:48.343 --> 01:49.982
I called at six, you saw me!

01:49.983 --> 01:51.822
The next contact time's midnight.

01:51.823 --> 01:53.902
Taking that girl with us is insane!

01:53.903 --> 01:56.262
How are we going to look after
her? It's not just her life!

01:56.263 --> 01:57.544
It's Grant's, it's ours...

01:57.545 --> 02:02.383
Right, I've had enough of your shit -
I'm taking her with us.

02:02.384 --> 02:04.822
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

02:04.823 --> 02:05.944
What do you mean?

02:07.984 --> 02:11.263
Like a break up?

02:11.264 --> 02:12.903
Yeah...

02:12.904 --> 02:15.224
if you're going to be all fuckin'...

02:16.464 --> 02:17.744
you know.

02:32.664 --> 02:35.462
Mr Rabbit was supposed to
be our ticket out of all this.

02:35.463 --> 02:37.462
There's still Milner.
She'll help.

02:37.463 --> 02:40.662
Then has it occurred to you, the
only reason she's not answering is

02:40.663 --> 02:43.104
because she knows
we lost the manuscript.

02:43.105 --> 02:46.543
Taking Alice with us
is not a good decision.

02:46.544 --> 02:48.703
She needs help.

02:48.704 --> 02:50.543
This will end bad.

02:50.544 --> 02:52.104
All she's got is us.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.743
Did you see how she looked at us?

03:05.744 --> 03:07.703
Like we're terrifying.

03:07.704 --> 03:08.904
Becky, she's in shock.

03:08.905 --> 03:10.664
No...

03:12.464 --> 03:13.584
She's right.

03:14.664 --> 03:16.623
We're scary.

03:16.624 --> 03:18.104
That's what we've become.

03:20.664 --> 03:23.264
We're just like them now.

03:43.904 --> 03:46.224
What's that? A piece of finger!

03:49.624 --> 03:51.984
How did you get involved in all this?

03:51.985 --> 03:53.903
Remember SARS?

03:53.904 --> 03:56.942
I worked for the Martarla Foundation
who discovered it.

03:56.943 --> 04:00.382
One of their top scientists,
a rising star - six figure salary,

04:00.383 --> 04:03.224
use of a private jet - you ever
been on a private jet?

04:05.624 --> 04:08.342
It's nice.
I was in Hong Kong when SARS hit.

04:08.343 --> 04:11.342
They kept it locked down, but
I thought, "Fuck that, I'm special."

04:11.343 --> 04:15.024
So I went in, had a look
and found out it didn't exist.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.183
What... SARS didn't exist?

04:19.184 --> 04:20.422
Nope. Whole thing was just a

04:20.423 --> 04:22.702
series of unconnected respiratory
infections,

04:22.703 --> 04:27.184
took me under an hour to discover
that there was no cause or link.

04:27.185 --> 04:29.664
So, I filed my report...

04:31.344 --> 04:32.664
and within a week...

04:34.824 --> 04:36.623
I was discredited,

04:36.624 --> 04:38.584
research destroyed...

04:40.424 --> 04:41.823
fired.

04:41.824 --> 04:45.742
I tried speaking out, but everyone
thought I'd just gone a bit, "David
Icke".

04:45.743 --> 04:47.544
But people died, SARS was...

04:47.545 --> 04:49.823
Started in November 2002.

04:49.824 --> 04:53.344
It lasted precisely seven months,
by summer 2003 it no longer existed.

04:53.345 --> 04:59.343
The "pandemic" affected just 8,422
people and killed 916.

04:59.344 --> 05:03.624
Do you know how many people die
each year from random respiratory
problems?

05:03.625 --> 05:06.343
SARS did not exist.

05:06.344 --> 05:08.263
Next question -

05:08.264 --> 05:09.542
why did they do it?

05:09.543 --> 05:11.264
Answer - I don't fucking know.

05:11.265 --> 05:13.543
All I know was within the next

05:13.544 --> 05:16.983
few weeks I was embroiled in a sex
scandal...

05:16.984 --> 05:21.383
Professor Pervert - addicted to coke
and prostitutes.

05:21.384 --> 05:23.343
So did they just set you up?

05:23.344 --> 05:24.623
Yes...

05:24.624 --> 05:26.663
Well, no...

05:26.664 --> 05:28.302
I do like cocaine and prostitutes,

05:28.303 --> 05:30.664
but they didn't have to tell anyone.

05:30.665 --> 05:33.063
I've never heard of Martarla.

05:33.064 --> 05:36.584
No, no-one has, but you've
heard of the parent company...

05:38.744 --> 05:39.784
Corvat?

05:48.224 --> 05:51.822
Erm, why don't you come back
tomorrow, I've got a lot of tests.

05:51.823 --> 05:53.462
Tomorrow - no fucking way.

05:53.463 --> 05:54.944
I've got to do some more tests.

05:54.945 --> 05:57.103
I am not leaving that here.

05:57.104 --> 06:00.424
Come back at one, I promise I'll
have something by then.

06:20.184 --> 06:21.304
Where are you going?

06:21.305 --> 06:23.263
There's a thing I have to...

06:23.264 --> 06:25.223
I said one.

06:25.224 --> 06:26.662
OK, yes, I did the test,

06:26.663 --> 06:28.984
and it's flu.
They're right - Russian flu.

06:28.985 --> 06:32.703
No, you're lying. Where's the
sample?

06:32.704 --> 06:35.542
I can't give it you back, I mean
it's infected...

06:35.543 --> 06:36.704
and I'm not lying.

06:36.705 --> 06:38.183
What's in there?

06:38.184 --> 06:40.543
Papers. Nothing, but papers.

06:40.544 --> 06:42.064
No, no... Ow!

06:46.104 --> 06:47.223
Arghhh!

06:47.224 --> 06:48.344
Grrrr.

06:50.104 --> 06:52.103
Ow!

06:52.104 --> 06:53.584
Is this it? Is this it?

06:54.824 --> 06:56.224
It's not what you think.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.784
Oh, Jesus Christ. It was chemical
poisoning.

07:00.824 --> 07:02.463
No flu at all!

07:02.464 --> 07:07.463
You have no idea how powerful...

07:07.464 --> 07:10.183
and rich they are.

07:10.184 --> 07:11.503
Let's split it.

07:11.504 --> 07:13.424
You want to use this for money?!

07:15.104 --> 07:18.263
They ruined my life...

07:18.264 --> 07:20.503
and I deserve compensation.

07:20.504 --> 07:21.784
I deserve it!

07:24.304 --> 07:26.623
Wait!

07:26.624 --> 07:28.024
Think about the money!

07:43.864 --> 07:46.223
Jesus Christ, it's massive!

07:46.224 --> 07:49.944
Yeah, I told you we'd find
the place eventually.

09:04.584 --> 09:07.343
Is it time to call Milner?

09:07.344 --> 09:09.823
Yeah.

09:09.824 --> 09:12.464
Let's just pray she answers.

09:18.024 --> 09:22.784
Come on!

10:14.069 --> 10:18.548
Arby has the manuscript.
But there are pages missing.

10:18.549 --> 10:21.549
He thinks Jessica Hyde removed them.

10:23.592 --> 10:25.352
And there's something else.

10:26.912 --> 10:30.832
I think he had her
and I think he let her go.

11:08.072 --> 11:11.192
You've gone all Goth!

11:14.712 --> 11:16.472
I'm in hiding.

11:17.547 --> 11:19.147
We have to hide.

11:22.427 --> 11:25.466
You OK?

11:25.467 --> 11:27.785
Alice, do you want
to talk about what...?

11:27.786 --> 11:31.545
I've got an essay due Friday.
How am I going to get it in?

11:31.546 --> 11:35.905
It's on crime and punishment. I need
to finish it. Do you have a laptop?

11:35.906 --> 11:37.745
What about paper? Is there paper?

11:37.746 --> 11:42.145
There must be paper. I'm on for
an A. I don't want my mark to drop.

11:42.146 --> 11:44.585
Alice, I've got paper.
I've got paper.

11:44.586 --> 11:46.785
- How am I going to get it in?
- Get it done. I'll find a way.

11:46.786 --> 11:48.625
Staying in one place is stupid!

11:48.626 --> 11:51.087
So is going cross country with
a child who's having a breakdown!

11:51.140 --> 11:52.780
Don't make me the bad guy. I...

11:52.781 --> 11:55.179
Why am I even...?

11:55.180 --> 11:57.140
You've both decided, haven't you?

11:57.141 --> 11:59.740
You've both... Fuck!

12:23.020 --> 12:24.820
Fuck!

12:35.700 --> 12:37.860
Come with me.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.780
Just come. Come on.

12:47.820 --> 12:52.499
We can't go to a restaurant,
so I thought we'd make our own.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.699
Our date, remember!

12:55.700 --> 12:57.660
Come on!

13:03.820 --> 13:07.179
Menu's shit. We've got
salt and vinegar crisps.

13:07.180 --> 13:09.819
Peperami and cheese.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.259
Oh, my God! This is shit.

13:12.260 --> 13:14.579
And the only drink's Fanta.

13:14.580 --> 13:16.380
I hate Fanta.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.380
Is this a table tennis table?

13:23.381 --> 13:25.180
Mm hm.

13:27.380 --> 13:29.500
Oh, and after...

13:32.340 --> 13:35.139
We've got a movie.

13:35.140 --> 13:39.939
Stare at that and I describe
the plot to Spiderman 2.

13:39.940 --> 13:42.820
Thank you.

14:06.020 --> 14:09.379
Have you still got those pages?

14:09.380 --> 14:11.860
Jessica!

14:24.140 --> 14:26.020
You haven't told anyone
about those pages?

14:26.021 --> 14:28.580
- No.
- Don't.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.540
Don't tell anyone, Grant.

14:33.980 --> 14:35.820
Just you and me.

14:36.980 --> 14:40.139
OK?

14:40.140 --> 14:44.339
I'll be around.
I'll keep an eye on you, I promise.

14:44.340 --> 14:46.900
What? Are you leaving?

14:56.060 --> 14:59.500
Keep this up or you'll die.

15:15.300 --> 15:18.780
Are you sure you don't remember
the name of Mr Rabbit?

15:18.781 --> 15:21.300
Just it began with an 'L'.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.219
What's over there?

15:26.220 --> 15:29.780
Grant...? What were you hiding
when I came in?

15:45.220 --> 15:47.780
Drawings?

15:49.300 --> 15:53.339
You did drawings of the manuscript?

15:53.340 --> 15:55.899
Why didn't you tell us?

15:55.900 --> 15:57.860
Well, they ain't very good.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.859
I can't remember her name.

16:02.860 --> 16:05.659
The woman in the book.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.180
The woman Raskolnikov kills.

16:10.660 --> 16:14.139
He kills this woman, this old woman.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.618
He kills her
and I can't remember her name.

16:16.619 --> 16:18.138
You can just say, "The woman!"

16:18.139 --> 16:22.058
No, I can't. I need the book.
Where's the book? I need it.

16:22.059 --> 16:23.540
We haven't got the book.

16:23.541 --> 16:27.260
No! I can't. I need the book.
Where's the book?

16:29.580 --> 16:31.740
It's OK.

16:44.900 --> 16:49.459
Alyona.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.780
Alyona Ivanovna.

16:59.420 --> 17:02.020
I'll go get you some more paper.

17:06.380 --> 17:09.098
Give us that.

17:09.099 --> 17:11.339
Give us it!

17:11.339 --> 17:13.059
I'm using it!

17:13.060 --> 17:15.339
Just give the paper at the back!

17:19.859 --> 17:22.220
Popeyed shit-legs.

17:24.180 --> 17:27.258
I don't know. I never really
knew what I wanted to do.

17:27.259 --> 17:30.500
My brother was always nagging me
about squandering my brain,

17:30.501 --> 17:32.460
thought I was a genius.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.859
I miss him.

17:35.860 --> 17:38.819
He's very driven,

17:38.820 --> 17:41.819
psycho-driven.

17:41.820 --> 17:44.179
This reminds me of him.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.980
He was mad for table tennis
when we were kids.

17:49.220 --> 17:51.460
I'd do anything to see him again.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.700
Well, this is nice.

17:57.820 --> 18:00.580
Better than drunk shagging
and angry shagging.

18:00.581 --> 18:03.219
Yeah. Though shagging was nice.

18:03.220 --> 18:06.739
Hm. Problem for you, though,

18:06.740 --> 18:08.860
is how are you going
to get in my knickers

18:08.861 --> 18:11.139
without me being drunk or angry?

18:11.140 --> 18:14.659
Yeah. Well...

18:14.660 --> 18:17.540
I could try telling you
that I like you.

18:19.380 --> 18:24.099
That I think a lot about your lips,
your eyes, your smile.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.420
I could tell you that
I know you're in the room

18:26.421 --> 18:28.539
even before I've seen you.

18:28.540 --> 18:33.419
And I could tell you that

18:33.420 --> 18:36.779
despite all this madness,
murder and mayhem,

18:36.780 --> 18:41.259
there's a corner of my soul
that feels like it's coming alive

18:41.260 --> 18:43.180
because of you.

18:44.860 --> 18:48.779
Mm. Yeah. That might do it.

18:48.780 --> 18:50.859
Good!

18:50.860 --> 18:52.379
Fuck! Shit!

18:52.380 --> 18:54.540
Don't worry. It was an accident.

18:54.541 --> 18:55.299
Fuck.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.499
It's OK, it's OK.

18:57.500 --> 19:01.420
The great thing about this place,
you can spill anything.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.698
You're never gonna believe this!

19:11.699 --> 19:14.820
I've been looking at these drawings
that Grant did of the manuscript.

19:16.180 --> 19:18.739
What are you twats doing?

19:18.740 --> 19:20.539
Grant did drawings?

19:20.540 --> 19:23.699
Yeah, just a few.
And, no, not of Mr Rabbit.

19:23.700 --> 19:26.539
But do you remember this?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.820
The Scientist makes a thing
called a ghost cell

19:28.821 --> 19:31.059
which he puts into a buffalo.

19:31.060 --> 19:36.019
The buffalo's killed,
fed to the man and the man rots.

19:36.020 --> 19:39.340
Yeah. It's what all the BSE
conspiracy stuff was based on.

19:39.341 --> 19:41.539
Yeah. Look, Grant's drawings!

19:41.540 --> 19:43.500
The Scientist creates a god
with two faces.

19:43.501 --> 19:47.660
And the god goes inside
the ghost cell. Roman mythology!

19:49.780 --> 19:53.259
A god with two faces! It's Janus.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.500
And that's how they get it into us.

19:55.501 --> 19:59.379
Via the food chain,
the same way they did with BSE.

19:59.380 --> 20:01.498
But, it would be noticed! Testing!

20:01.499 --> 20:03.258
Maybe it looks like something else.

20:03.259 --> 20:05.060
There's tons of bacterial shit
in food.

20:05.061 --> 20:07.619
And if Corvadt's a Nazi...

20:07.620 --> 20:11.940
Like what, a disease
that targets certain races?

20:14.980 --> 20:18.860
What if it's not the disease that's
selective, what if it's the cure?

20:21.980 --> 20:25.300
Russian flu.
Corvadt are making the vaccine.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.259
Right. How do you get flu?

20:29.260 --> 20:31.458
Somebody sneezes
and you breathe it in.

20:31.459 --> 20:33.178
No. No, no. You ingest it.

20:33.179 --> 20:35.258
Mostly you get it on your hands
and you ingest it.

20:35.259 --> 20:38.658
So, they adapt
some fucking weapons-grade flu virus

20:38.659 --> 20:40.178
so it can be hidden in food,

20:40.179 --> 20:44.460
and Corvadt make a vaccine that's
only effective on certain races.

20:44.461 --> 20:47.379
After Fetlar, people are terrified.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.138
One more outbreak like that

20:49.139 --> 20:52.658
and they'll be rioting to get it
in their arms. Fuck testing!

20:52.659 --> 20:54.140
But you'd need it in so much food.

20:54.141 --> 20:55.260
Yeah, you would.

20:57.260 --> 21:00.060
See that symbol.
It's everywhere in Part Two.

21:03.300 --> 21:06.139
Don't you recognise that symbol?

21:06.140 --> 21:10.419
Pergus Holdings, they're massive.
Like Kraft or Nestle.

21:10.420 --> 21:13.580
They manufacture everything
from crisps to fizzy drinks,

21:13.581 --> 21:19.100
to pet food and that is their logo.

21:23.860 --> 21:25.660
Fuck!

22:10.435 --> 22:12.275
Have a nice date?

22:12.369 --> 22:15.968
Jesus Christ! Where've you been?

22:15.969 --> 22:18.208
Are you and Becky an item now?

22:18.209 --> 22:19.609
Where the fuck have you been?

22:21.089 --> 22:22.649
The phone Milner gave you.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.469
Take it out and call her.

22:26.477 --> 22:27.636
No, Jessica.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.957
Look, I don't know
what your game is, but I am not...

22:30.997 --> 22:33.477
Call Milner.

22:41.757 --> 22:43.636
Voicemail.

22:43.637 --> 22:45.637
Tell her you're with Jessica Hyde.

22:48.437 --> 22:49.677
It's Ian.

22:51.797 --> 22:54.236
I'm with Jessica Hyde.

22:54.237 --> 22:57.195
If they were tapping her phone,
you've just killed her.

22:57.196 --> 22:59.157
You still think so small, Ian.

23:00.397 --> 23:02.797
So... IT.

23:42.277 --> 23:44.956
"Gone to get supplies"?

23:44.957 --> 23:47.517
What is it with him and notes?

23:49.197 --> 23:51.635
Becky, if I show you something,
will you...

23:51.636 --> 23:55.077
Becky, if I show you something,
do you promise not to get angry?

23:55.078 --> 23:57.437
No, show it me!

24:02.237 --> 24:05.557
I found it in the van.
Don't worry, I turned it off,

24:05.558 --> 24:07.876
but if we were to turn it on...

24:07.877 --> 24:10.715
We need to find out
about Purgus Holdings.

24:10.716 --> 24:13.675
Now, I can find download malware
that will confuse the IMEI of this -

24:13.676 --> 24:16.157
any search will make it
look as though...

24:17.997 --> 24:19.637
So let's go for a walk.

24:21.237 --> 24:22.717
Do it from far away to be safe.

24:30.477 --> 24:32.196
How's Alice?

24:32.197 --> 24:35.835
Grant said all she's talking about
is getting her essay in.

24:35.836 --> 24:38.517
It's like she's switched off,
or something.

24:41.197 --> 24:43.037
Do you think she'll be OK?

24:46.477 --> 24:49.437
I... I dunno.

24:59.317 --> 25:00.276
Here's great.

25:00.277 --> 25:01.995
All right. First, check we're alone.

25:01.996 --> 25:03.997
You look up there,
I'll look down here.

25:21.477 --> 25:23.397
We lost the manuscript.

25:25.437 --> 25:28.157
No, you listen!
Tell me what's going on!

25:28.158 --> 25:30.677
Are they infecting people, are they?

25:32.917 --> 25:34.597
Stop lying, that's bullshit.

25:38.237 --> 25:43.076
Look, I need to see you.
Tomorrow morning, 6.15.

25:43.077 --> 25:46.317
I'll send you my location.
I'm in trouble.

25:50.837 --> 25:52.556
All right?

25:52.557 --> 25:53.997
Yeah.

25:59.357 --> 26:02.997
It says here Pergus were
a small-time processed food company

26:02.998 --> 26:07.476
up until 1993. Then, suddenly,
they started buying subsidiaries

26:07.477 --> 26:13.636
in Europe, Africa,
South America - they're everywhere.

26:13.637 --> 26:15.996
All right. What happened in '93?

26:15.997 --> 26:20.796
Er... A new CEO. Lane Monroe.

26:20.797 --> 26:22.396
Shit!

26:22.397 --> 26:23.917
Lane.

26:26.117 --> 26:27.637
'L'.

26:29.877 --> 26:32.476
Is that Mr Rabbit?

26:32.477 --> 26:33.997
What, him?!

26:36.037 --> 26:38.397
Fuck it, I'm gonna get his address.

26:44.077 --> 26:46.395
Oh, maybe I'll have a look
for my dad.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.677
You know, he would have p...

26:47.678 --> 26:48.876
Don't!

26:48.877 --> 26:51.276
No, it's a perfect opport...

26:51.277 --> 26:53.157
We can't risk.

26:55.957 --> 26:57.397
Yeah?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.956
What's this?

27:06.957 --> 27:09.797
I lied. I did keep a piece.

27:11.917 --> 27:15.276
Kevin Baig, resident of Fetlar,

27:15.277 --> 27:18.677
listed dead from Russian Flu,
Thursday the 14th.

27:20.317 --> 27:23.877
This says he was poisoned
by chromic potassium sulphate.

27:26.757 --> 27:28.837
I want Anya released.

27:31.077 --> 27:35.956
It's the child. Christ,
it's the child. I should've known.

27:35.957 --> 27:37.956
I've copies with lawyers.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.635
Sealed, they don't know what it is,

27:39.636 --> 27:43.917
but they know to send it to press
if I don't phone in every two hours.

27:45.717 --> 27:47.877
Do you know how stupid you look?

27:47.878 --> 27:50.476
Don't do this, Michael, come on.

27:50.477 --> 27:53.597
We will wreck your life,
we will do so much dam...

27:53.598 --> 27:56.716
Release Anya.

27:56.717 --> 27:59.676
Yes, well,
we're not going to do that.

27:59.677 --> 28:04.076
You're proving yourself
surprisingly unpredictable.

28:04.077 --> 28:07.797
We need collateral.
So we can't release her, can we?

28:09.357 --> 28:11.355
What does surprise me is that,

28:11.356 --> 28:13.715
given you know
what we are capable of,

28:13.716 --> 28:16.075
you still seem
to think you can negotiate.

28:16.076 --> 28:18.475
Now, obviously,
we can't hurt you physically,

28:18.476 --> 28:20.357
because of your supposed lawyers.

28:20.358 --> 28:22.037
So...

28:29.437 --> 28:30.956
Is that Jen?

28:30.957 --> 28:32.397
Mm-hmm.

28:36.517 --> 28:40.557
If you hurt her, I'll have nothing
to lose, you remember that!

28:40.558 --> 28:42.117
Alexi, give us a wave.

28:45.877 --> 28:47.517
Alexi has a folder.

28:48.717 --> 28:53.076
It contains photos of you
and Anya fucking, of course -

28:53.077 --> 28:59.156
dates, times, a scan of your baby
and a rather lurid DVD.

28:59.157 --> 29:03.956
Give me everything you have by 8pm
or he will hand it to your wife.

29:03.957 --> 29:06.635
You see, there are lots of grades
of hurt we can do to a life.

29:06.636 --> 29:08.677
And we have the will
to inflict them all.

30:44.397 --> 30:46.076
'Have they seen you?'

30:46.077 --> 30:49.196
Milner? Jesus, is that you...?

30:49.197 --> 30:50.677
'Have they seen you, yes or no?'

30:50.678 --> 30:53.396
No, no, they haven't.

30:53.397 --> 30:56.717
'I'm sending in a distraction,
get out of there now.'

31:14.557 --> 31:16.395
Milner, I'm sorry, I just...

31:16.396 --> 31:20.277
Do you think this is a fucking game?
Is that it, you stupid...

31:20.278 --> 31:22.116
No, no I don't! I'm sorry.

31:22.117 --> 31:25.035
Sorry?
They have your families staked out!

31:25.036 --> 31:28.035
You were picked up three times
on facial recognition -

31:28.036 --> 31:31.555
if I hadn't managed to intercept it,
you and your brother would be dead!

31:31.556 --> 31:34.395
What kind of risk do you think
that puts me in?

31:34.396 --> 31:35.757
I just wanted to see him!

31:37.277 --> 31:40.515
I've had a team on you all morning.
They have no idea what this is.

31:40.516 --> 31:44.275
I don't know how I'm going to
explain that little sideshow.

31:44.276 --> 31:47.875
Why is there a message on my phone
from you about Jessica Hyde?

31:47.876 --> 31:51.117
She had a gun to my head.
I thought she was setting you up.

31:53.317 --> 31:54.877
You lost the manuscript.

31:56.877 --> 31:58.996
How... how do you know...?

31:58.997 --> 32:03.276
I'm a spy. It's, sort of,
the point of what I do.

32:03.277 --> 32:05.837
What's interesting is the person
who took it still has it.

32:05.838 --> 32:08.036
That means we have a chance.

32:08.037 --> 32:09.276
We're a mess!

32:09.277 --> 32:11.755
The others are worse than me,
we're not up to this!

32:11.756 --> 32:13.557
Well, you bloody well have to be!

32:15.277 --> 32:18.235
Look, Carvel finished
Janus before he died.

32:18.236 --> 32:20.235
He wrote it into the manuscript.

32:20.236 --> 32:21.877
So it's in the manuscript?

32:21.878 --> 32:23.316
Yes.

32:23.317 --> 32:26.676
Whatever Janus does or is,
it's in those pages.

32:26.677 --> 32:29.437
I think I know what it is.
We figured some stuff out.

32:33.317 --> 32:35.557
Good God, is that the manuscript?

32:40.997 --> 32:42.517
I read it.

32:44.757 --> 32:47.597
There's a boy. They torture him.

32:50.117 --> 32:51.596
He has one comfort.

32:51.597 --> 32:53.277
A sweet.

32:55.357 --> 32:57.357
Chocolate raisins.

32:59.717 --> 33:01.077
You lied.

33:02.637 --> 33:04.037
That boy is long gone!

33:04.038 --> 33:08.116
They ripped everything from you,
even your name.

33:08.117 --> 33:10.517
You think you're called Arby.

33:12.637 --> 33:17.477
But it's not a name,
it's initials - RB.

33:18.837 --> 33:20.197
"Raisin Boy".

33:21.477 --> 33:25.677
It's what they called you
when they forgot who you were.

33:26.997 --> 33:28.637
I'm all you have, Arby...

33:42.957 --> 33:45.437
Where is Jessica Hyde?

34:06.877 --> 34:10.876
If I see anyone else there,
I'll kill them.

34:10.877 --> 34:13.357
And destroy this.

34:25.277 --> 34:27.837
What was my name?

34:31.317 --> 34:32.877
Pietre.

34:33.956 --> 34:36.317
Your name was Pietre.

34:46.077 --> 34:48.156
You might be right, Ian.

34:48.157 --> 34:50.675
Monroe ran secret nerve agent
research for the CIA

34:50.676 --> 34:53.315
before Pergus.
He's network, definitely.

34:53.315 --> 34:55.635
But for now,
it's all about the manuscript.

34:55.636 --> 34:58.355
There are several parties
searching for it.

34:58.356 --> 35:00.195
Jessica will be the one
who finds it.

35:00.196 --> 35:02.395
What makes you think
she'll come back to us?

35:02.396 --> 35:04.077
Where else does she have to go?

35:05.517 --> 35:07.436
You'd better get back.

35:07.437 --> 35:10.355
Don't tell your friends
about this thing with Roy.

35:10.356 --> 35:11.957
They need to believe in you.

35:15.317 --> 35:16.797
You're doing well, Ian.

35:29.037 --> 35:32.477
"Raskolnikov desires
the power of life over death.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.276
"He kills the old woman

35:34.277 --> 35:37.035
"because he decides that the world
is better off without her.

35:37.036 --> 35:40.515
"But really he wants to discover
what it's like to end a life.

35:40.516 --> 35:42.515
"He deduces that killing the human

35:42.516 --> 35:45.397
"is right in the pursuit
of a higher cause."

35:46.837 --> 35:48.717
Yeah. Yeah, that's great, Alice.

35:53.437 --> 35:55.477
Reckon that'll be an A, definitely.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.557
So you found out where Monroe lives?

36:01.558 --> 36:04.036
Yeah, we did. We need to go.

36:04.037 --> 36:07.077
With respect, I don't think
you're thinking straight.

36:07.078 --> 36:09.476
We go. We find Monroe,

36:09.477 --> 36:13.197
and we see if he's got Chinese
character for a rabbit carved on...

36:13.198 --> 36:15.197
Then what? We whack him?!

36:17.077 --> 36:20.117
He's right. We go.

36:21.997 --> 36:24.037
Sick of waiting
for people to save us.

36:26.997 --> 36:29.797
So she kissed you? On the mouth?

36:31.477 --> 36:32.835
Did you kiss her back?

36:32.836 --> 36:34.397
Becky, she had a gun to my head!

36:35.677 --> 36:37.157
Did you enjoy it?

36:38.277 --> 36:40.556
Well, I suppose she's attractive.

36:40.557 --> 36:44.157
In a kind of skinny-bitch,
evil, murderess kind of way.

36:52.117 --> 36:54.356
Are you Becky?

36:54.357 --> 36:56.317
Yeah, I am.

36:58.357 --> 37:00.157
I'm Alice.

37:08.317 --> 37:09.317
Get in.

37:32.517 --> 37:35.957
I want the manuscript.
And you are going to take me to it.

37:36.957 --> 37:38.237
Of course.

37:39.357 --> 37:41.317
That's why I'm here.

38:26.831 --> 38:29.310
There's your dispatch of vaccine.

38:29.311 --> 38:31.950
We agreed you'd do the testing.

38:31.951 --> 38:34.269
I've arranged for a car,
it's waiting downstairs,

38:34.270 --> 38:35.471
to take you to the lab.

38:35.472 --> 38:41.230
So one of us nips in the garage,

38:41.231 --> 38:43.030
goes up,

38:43.031 --> 38:45.430
breaks in

38:45.431 --> 38:47.511
and forces Monroe to buzz
the rest up.

38:51.351 --> 38:52.910
Which one of us?

38:52.911 --> 38:54.590
He's an old white dude?

38:54.591 --> 38:56.431
Who's he gonna be more scared of?

38:58.391 --> 39:00.071
You look like a psycho pirate.

39:03.631 --> 39:05.471
Yeah...

39:10.671 --> 39:12.230
Where are we going?

39:12.231 --> 39:14.390
Up there...

39:14.391 --> 39:16.231
See the prick that did this to us.

39:38.111 --> 39:39.911
What the fuck is he doing?

40:09.671 --> 40:11.309
'..but, according to Jarrod,

40:11.310 --> 40:13.431
'no-one around can remember a time
when the crop

40:13.432 --> 40:15.270
'was this bad.

40:15.271 --> 40:18.989
'Many are saying, if the rains don't
come soon, they're finished.

40:18.990 --> 40:21.151
'But, for some, it is already
too late.'

40:22.391 --> 40:23.830
Is it money?

40:23.831 --> 40:24.990
Do you want...

40:24.991 --> 40:26.311
Get up!

40:32.311 --> 40:35.150
You need to open the garage door.

40:35.151 --> 40:36.831
My friends want to talk to you.

40:38.071 --> 40:39.911
Oh, no, no.

40:41.791 --> 40:44.270
All right, listen.

40:44.271 --> 40:48.510
I have done everything
that you asked, all right?

40:48.511 --> 40:50.070
Let them in.

40:50.071 --> 40:51.790
Now.

40:51.791 --> 40:53.311
All right.

40:56.711 --> 40:57.791
All right, all right.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.470
OK.

41:02.471 --> 41:05.431
Don't do this, OK.

41:08.191 --> 41:10.070
I have been loyal.

41:10.071 --> 41:11.871
You haven't done what we asked.

41:11.872 --> 41:13.630
What?

41:13.631 --> 41:15.271
I did! I did everything.

41:16.351 --> 41:18.070
What did you do?

41:18.071 --> 41:19.471
You did nothing.

41:20.511 --> 41:22.069
The GCHN1 protein is everywhere!

41:22.070 --> 41:24.351
I made sure it was everywhere,
what more do you want?

41:27.071 --> 41:29.070
All right.

41:29.071 --> 41:30.711
All right! OK.

41:40.631 --> 41:41.830
You're not them?

41:41.831 --> 41:44.590
Surprise. Come on. Move!

41:44.591 --> 41:45.791
All right, all right.

41:46.831 --> 41:48.270
You stay in there

41:48.271 --> 41:50.791
and whatever you hear,
don't come out.

41:56.471 --> 41:58.070
Fuck!

41:58.071 --> 42:00.349
Well, if he's not
Mr Rabbit let's just leave.

42:00.350 --> 42:02.591
He knows something,
he's talking about...

42:02.592 --> 42:04.751
Grant? What about my essay?

42:06.151 --> 42:09.350
It's late, we need to get it in.

42:09.351 --> 42:11.111
Ain't gonna happen, Alice.

42:12.271 --> 42:14.510
Alice...

42:14.511 --> 42:16.430
Your mum...

42:16.431 --> 42:18.630
Is it him?

42:18.631 --> 42:20.430
In there?

42:20.431 --> 42:22.470
He did this?

42:22.471 --> 42:25.070
What's the GCHN1 protein?

42:25.071 --> 42:26.350
Please...

42:26.351 --> 42:27.870
I'm not...

42:27.871 --> 42:30.550
Look, I am no-one.

42:30.551 --> 42:32.231
I was doing what I was told.

42:34.271 --> 42:35.711
Why don't you answer the question?

42:35.712 --> 42:37.471
Oh!

42:38.711 --> 42:39.990
Ow!

42:39.991 --> 42:41.711
What the fuck are you doing?

42:41.712 --> 42:45.511
It was a protein that we
bred into foodstuffs, OK!

42:46.711 --> 42:48.471
A modification of corn.

42:49.631 --> 42:51.791
We bred a corn with a softer husk.

42:53.471 --> 42:58.150
It could be broken down,
used in animal feeds.

42:58.151 --> 43:01.630
It saved farmers billions,
everyone wanted it.

43:01.631 --> 43:03.191
What does the protein do?

43:03.405 --> 43:05.004
Do?

43:05.005 --> 43:06.805
It doesn't do anything.

43:08.005 --> 43:10.003
It contains a modified amino acid
that helps

43:10.004 --> 43:14.003
with the softening process,
but it's not necessary for it.

43:14.004 --> 43:16.923
The amino acid is absorbed
harmlessly into the body.

43:16.924 --> 43:19.363
So you went through all that trouble
to get this amino acid

43:19.364 --> 43:21.205
in food and it does nothing?

43:21.206 --> 43:23.724
Look.. I'm just a cog.

43:23.725 --> 43:25.564
I was paid!

43:25.565 --> 43:27.325
I was just doing what I was told.

43:27.326 --> 43:29.124
Who is Mr Rabbit?

43:29.125 --> 43:31.844
Christ, I don't know that!

43:31.845 --> 43:33.205
Who do you think I am?

43:33.239 --> 43:35.659
Do you know about Janus?

43:35.717 --> 43:37.316
You know that name?

43:37.317 --> 43:40.037
If you're a cog,
then how come you know about Janus?

43:40.815 --> 43:42.535
That's my dad.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.695
Becky, that's my dad.

43:52.735 --> 43:54.735
So what? They killed him?

43:56.975 --> 44:00.014
They killed Dad?

44:00.015 --> 44:02.094
Wilson...

44:02.095 --> 44:03.855
I'm... I'm so sorry.

44:08.095 --> 44:08.655
No, no, no!

44:08.656 --> 44:09.814
Wilson, no!

44:09.815 --> 44:11.454
Wilson.. Wilson, don't.

44:11.455 --> 44:13.534
You said he was alive!

44:13.535 --> 44:16.015
You sat down with me
and you said he was alive!

44:16.016 --> 44:18.374
I had to... We couldn't risk it.

44:18.375 --> 44:20.535
Did you know about this?

44:23.815 --> 44:25.615
You're supposed to be my friends!

44:25.616 --> 44:26.814
We are, we are!

44:26.815 --> 44:28.734
You're not! None of you!

44:28.735 --> 44:30.014
You lied!

44:30.015 --> 44:31.734
No, please...

44:31.735 --> 44:33.895
They killed him. They killed him.

44:33.896 --> 44:35.295
Wilson, leave it.

44:42.775 --> 44:44.093
The concierge knows I'm here.

44:44.094 --> 44:46.335
If I don't answer that,
he'll come up!

44:47.815 --> 44:49.455
Wilson? We need him to answer.

44:49.456 --> 44:52.894
Grant and Alice are here.

44:52.895 --> 44:54.054
Please...

44:54.055 --> 44:55.734
It's all right.

44:55.735 --> 44:57.615
Come on.

45:08.935 --> 45:10.615
Whoever it is, get rid of them.

45:17.255 --> 45:18.734
Send them up.

45:18.735 --> 45:20.575
You fucking little shit!

45:23.975 --> 45:26.455
Right, you! Move!

45:32.695 --> 45:35.934
Grant? Point that at his legs.

45:35.935 --> 45:38.534
If he moves, shoot his knees off.

45:38.535 --> 45:40.175
Fucking, yes!

45:43.815 --> 45:45.734
Monroe, it's Letts.

45:45.735 --> 45:47.694
Conran Letts.

45:47.695 --> 45:50.734
Jesus Christ,
what are we going to do?

45:50.735 --> 45:52.574
Monroe?

45:52.575 --> 45:54.055
Hold this a sec.

45:56.815 --> 45:59.255
You and I need to talk.

46:00.855 --> 46:03.055
Monroe! Open the door!

46:39.575 --> 46:41.734
He killed my mum, Becky.

46:41.735 --> 46:43.055
Jesus Christ!

46:44.375 --> 46:45.854
What do we do? Ian?

46:45.855 --> 46:48.534
We go... now.

46:48.535 --> 46:49.855
And we take him with us.

46:49.856 --> 46:51.615
OK.
