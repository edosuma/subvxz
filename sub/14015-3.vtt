NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.769 --> 00:06.679
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.740 --> 00:08.550
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.609 --> 00:11.419
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.478 --> 00:13.188
These are their stories.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.090
RON: But I have a guaranteed
reservation for a suite.

00:16.149 --> 00:19.129
I'm sorry, sir, but as of midnight
the computers moved your suite

00:19.186 --> 00:20.786
into the pool of assignable rooms.
Ron...

00:20.854 --> 00:22.274
I called from the plane.
I talked to someone.

00:22.322 --> 00:23.532
IRENE: Ron, please,
this isn't helping anything.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.500
Look, what do we need, a note from the
pilot saying why we didn't make it?

00:26.560 --> 00:28.560
IRENE: This isn't helping anything.
RON: Don't you start on me, too.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.109
Just let me deal
with this gentleman.

00:31.498 --> 00:33.808
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

00:34.134 --> 00:35.814
(IRENE GASPING)

00:37.471 --> 00:38.611
I thought he was drunk.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.212
We get all kinds wandering in
here at this hour of the morning.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.185
Maybe this one
wandered in from your bar.

00:43.243 --> 00:44.353
No, the bar is over there.

00:44.411 --> 00:45.911
He was coming from upstairs.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.959
Detective, how much longer
is this going to take?

00:48.015 --> 00:50.615
Our guests are quite sensitive
to this kind of thing.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.364
Yeah, especially this guest.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.869
In his pocket.
No ID, no wallet.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.992
Any way to find out
what room this belongs to.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.358
No, they're untraceable.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.596
A security precaution.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.331
I'm sure he appreciated it.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.995
Hey, next time there's a heart
attack at 3:00 in the morning,

01:05.065 --> 01:06.695
why don't you call it
into the 2-0?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.767
I didn't know what we got here.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.610
Before he keeled over, did you notice
if he was holding his left arm?

01:12.673 --> 01:14.153
No, he just looked drunk.

01:14.207 --> 01:15.907
BRISCOE:
Was he slurring his words?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.416
JENSEN:
No, he was trying to speak.

01:17.477 --> 01:18.887
Could be a stroke.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.486
Yeah.
How about a stroke of lead?

01:21.548 --> 01:22.748
Look at that.

01:22.816 --> 01:23.816
Jeez.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.034
Blink once and you'd miss it.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.356
Must be a small caliber.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.301
There's no exit wound.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.470
Could be a .22.
That'll do it.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.595
Ping-pongs off his vitals,
all the bleeding's internal.

01:34.661 --> 01:35.801
Great.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.872
I liked him better
when he had a heart attack.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.704
Just making sure that
everything's okay here.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.557
Okay. 524's next.

02:39.626 --> 02:42.506
You know, there's gotta be
an easier way than this.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.314
Go ahead, open it.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.521
My, my, what a mess.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.719
Okay, what do you got?

03:04.518 --> 03:05.898
Shiunro Hayashi.

03:05.986 --> 03:09.586
Room's charged to a corporate
credit card from a...

03:09.656 --> 03:11.526
Ingoyo Leisure Company.

03:11.591 --> 03:12.801
Tokyo address.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.959
Phone cord's
pulled out of the wall.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.968
Look what's sitting
right in front of me.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.270
A wallet.

03:18.331 --> 03:19.571
Okay.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.778
Picture ID, and it's him.

03:24.404 --> 03:28.554
Credit cards, receipt from a
traveler's check, and there's no cash.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.159
And we have a shell casing.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.519
.22.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.920
Is this starting
to remind you of something?

03:35.982 --> 03:39.292
Couple of weeks ago a German tourist
got a surprise visit, right?

03:39.352 --> 03:41.392
That was
one of the Barrington hotels.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.895
Midtown
and definitely mid-range.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.804
The rumor about that
is that it was an inside job.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.140
We're going to need a list
of all your employees.

03:49.196 --> 03:52.136
And we're gonna want to talk to
everybody who's staying on this floor.

03:52.199 --> 03:55.869
I'm sure the Barrington wasn't put
through this sort of inconvenience.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.466
Nobody left the Barrington
in a bag.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.986
I've got calls
from the Asahi Shimbun,

04:02.042 --> 04:04.962
the Nippon Weekly,
the Japan Times,

04:05.011 --> 04:08.861
and that's not counting the Japanese
consulate climbing all over us.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.592
Yeah, great. They can help us sort
through the 85 sets of fingerprints.

04:12.652 --> 04:15.332
Okay, there's no calls
from his room after 5:00.

04:15.388 --> 04:18.928
No one on the floor saw anything
go in or out of his room

04:19.358 --> 04:21.399
and no one heard anything.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.698
And no forced entry.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.937
At the Barrington, didn't
the robber talk his way in?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.340
Yeah, he identified himself
as hotel maintenance.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.612
German tourist lets him in,
gets pistol-whipped.

04:31.671 --> 04:34.981
Hayashi has no bruises, but he
gets a slug through the armpit.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.251
Maybe that's what it took.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.759
Seems this guy
was carrying a wad.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.892
According to the travelers' check company,
Hayashi cashed 10 grand yesterday

04:41.948 --> 04:43.118
at the front desk.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.963
That's a lot
of walking around money.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.118
I bet someone at the front
desk thought so, too.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.362
TEAGLE: You'd be amazed how many
guests come back an hour later

04:51.424 --> 04:53.174
claiming we shorted them.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.596
This put an end to that.

04:54.661 --> 04:58.341
Hayashi, 10:08.
$10,000 and your signature.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.865
Anybody else who might know how
much Hayashi was carrying?

05:01.935 --> 05:03.275
Anyone in tipping range.

05:03.336 --> 05:04.906
He was unusually generous.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.851
You've got other receipts here
with someone else's signature.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.248
Danny Zabel.
I was training him.

05:10.510 --> 05:14.520
I had to make him forget everything
he learned at the Barrington.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.331
LOGAN: According
to the manager,

05:19.386 --> 05:22.696
you were with him when he helped the
victim cash some travelers' checks?

05:23.490 --> 05:25.090
He was Japanese.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.398
Hayashi?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.238
I guess.
I don't really remember.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.273
You were working
at the Barrington, midtown,

05:32.332 --> 05:34.642
when a similar robbery
happened, right?

05:34.701 --> 05:38.771
Look, at the Barrington the police
talked to everybody, all right?

05:38.939 --> 05:40.349
I wasn't even in town
when that happened.

05:40.407 --> 05:44.317
So it's for no particular reason
that you're not there anymore?

05:45.212 --> 05:46.752
I was laid off.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.987
It happens.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.118
They told us you quit
a week after the robbery.

05:51.818 --> 05:53.318
Let me tell you something,
Danny.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.796
Robberies happen all the time.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.265
Now, maybe the detectives down at
the Barrington let things slide,

05:58.325 --> 05:59.355
but we don't.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.626
We want the shooter, big guy.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.804
I don't know, I...
Good, we'll take you.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.676
You're just as good for it.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.241
Hold on.
All right, all right.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.551
You were saying?

06:13.573 --> 06:16.923
The stupid idiot. He wasn't
supposed to kill anybody.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.181
Who?

06:19.446 --> 06:20.646
Charlie Kett.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.524
He's my brother-in-law.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.062
He got out of prison
six months ago.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.687
He says I gotta help him or
he takes it out on my sister.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.402
Hey, hey, Mikey, heard you
got one handed to you, huh?

06:31.458 --> 06:32.958
Yeah. For once,
we did something right.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.336
It should be big news in Tokyo.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.276
A slightly late
Detective Logan.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.112
Mr. Nakahara
from the Japanese consulate.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.708
He's here
for Mr. Hayashi's remains.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.042
How are you?

06:47.107 --> 06:50.547
Lieutenant Van Buren tells me
you are making progress.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.624
I have great respect
for the New York police.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.680
I am sure you will solve
this terrible crime.

06:57.717 --> 06:58.887
So are we.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.092
In Japan,
murders are so unusual,

07:02.155 --> 07:05.325
each one can receive the full
attention of the police.

07:05.392 --> 07:08.862
Mr. Nakahara, we may be
overworked and understaffed,

07:08.929 --> 07:12.929
but we sure do like to catch
murderers, no matter who they kill.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.879
Yes. Let me know when we can
take possession of the remains.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.806
Of course.
Thank you.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.879
Nice gull...

07:23.944 --> 07:26.894
Probably thinks you have to be born
eating sushi to get the job done.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.147
Maybe a little brain food
wouldn't hurt.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.915
We located Charles Kett.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.494
He's been in Rikers
since yesterday afternoon.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.733
Picked up on a DWI,
with outstanding warrants.

07:37.023 --> 07:40.473
So if Kett was locked up,
that leaves us with Zabel.

07:40.527 --> 07:43.627
I don't quite picture Mighty Mouse
robbing Hayashi by himself.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.227
We'll hold him as Kett's
accomplice on the Barrington job.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.939
Maybe the shooter's someone Hayashi
brought back to the hotel.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.213
Walk in his shoes.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.911
See who turns up.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.847
What's the deal, Mike?

07:54.908 --> 07:57.718
Your favorite uncle
died at Pearl Harbor?

07:58.745 --> 08:00.275
It's their attitude.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.617
They think they're better
than everybody else.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.787
Masters of the universe.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.352
Doesn't that bother you?

08:07.420 --> 08:10.330
No, what bothers me is some kid
heisting my car for a living

08:10.390 --> 08:13.030
because nobody taught him
how to read.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.503
Lighter than air.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.172
Jacket alone
must be worth two grand.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.576
You believe this is what he
wears to go hit some balls?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.593
Golf Land.
Indoor driving range.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.394
West 34th.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.580
6:00 p.m.,
that's the day he got shot.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.615
Well, look around.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.957
Someone of the Japanese persuasion
would hardly stand out.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.564
Well, what if I told you that
Mr. Hayashi is a very big tipper?

08:47.627 --> 08:49.197
Would that jog your memory?

08:49.262 --> 08:51.112
Yeah, I remember him now.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.084
Actually,
I remember his friend.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.313
A woman?
No, a black guy.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.008
You don't often see
a twosome like that.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.614
He gave me his card.

08:59.672 --> 09:03.122
I think I still have his
number around here somewhere.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.679
I booked some piano players
for his clubs in Tokyo.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.822
I don't know if it's because they
saw Casablanca too many times,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.795
but a cat who can hum
As Time Goes By

09:13.853 --> 09:15.763
can make a very decent living
over there.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.532
So you talked about
lounge acts?

09:17.590 --> 09:21.440
He was also interested in singers,
of the white female variety.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.004
After golf
what else was on the menu?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.574
He invited me along
for some socializing.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.773
The man has...
had a lot of energy.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.276
I, on the other hand,
have a wife.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.438
My condolences.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.776
Any idea
where Hayashi was heading?

09:35.842 --> 09:38.322
Club in midtown.
The East-West.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.681
Said I wouldn't be
disappointed.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.087
KENDRICK: The Japanese are about the last
people in America who still eat steak.

09:44.150 --> 09:47.390
Yeah, and about the only people
who pay $75 for prime rib.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.464
They pay twice
that much in Tokyo.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.302
Anyway, it's all
on their expense account.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.557
This is where they do business.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.935
They relax, close a couple of
deals, and the wives stay at home.

09:55.995 --> 09:58.765
So was Hayashi closing any
deals the other night?

09:58.932 --> 09:59.932
It was a social call.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.279
I met him in Tokyo
about three years ago.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.805
That's where I got the idea.

10:03.870 --> 10:07.650
I saw how he ran his club, and I figured
with all the Japanese over here,

10:07.707 --> 10:09.407
they need a place
where they feel at home.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.246
At home? Look at this.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.621
You got American songs,
girls, food.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.391
What's home about that?

10:16.449 --> 10:19.489
People think they want to bring
America to its knees, uh-uh?

10:19.886 --> 10:21.516
They wanna be America.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.498
They prefer their scotch mellow,
and their women blonde.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.797
How about Hayashi?
Did he leave alone?

10:26.860 --> 10:27.860
Are you kidding?

10:27.927 --> 10:29.337
A guy like him?

10:29.395 --> 10:31.965
He was with one
of the waitresses, Suzy.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.005
I think they might've
left together.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.477
I saw her in the back.
She's cashing out.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.170
Sure, I was with him.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.808
That makes me guilty
of bad taste, not murder.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.984
The United Nations thing
didn't work out?

10:43.042 --> 10:44.952
We understood
each other perfectly.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.491
He wanted to take,
I didn't wanna give.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.217
Some things
I don't do on the first date.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.662
Unless you're getting
paid for it.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.247
I just called up her yellows.

10:52.318 --> 10:57.058
Felony larceny, solicitation, and a little
incident of you discharging a weapon.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.340
.22, surprise, surprise.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.702
Some guy was starting with me.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.900
I told him the next shot would have him
singing with the Vienna Boys Choir.

11:03.963 --> 11:06.883
Right. Now you got Hayashi
singing with a different choir.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.243
I told you,
all we did was kiss.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.945
Then I asked
for money up front.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.207
He said he never
had to pay for it.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.045
Like just because they own
Rockefeller Center

11:17.110 --> 11:18.520
I'm supposed to go to bed
with him?

11:18.578 --> 11:22.418
And meanwhile, the better part of 10
grand is falling out of his wallet.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.179
I'm calling my lawyer.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.360
Good. Tell him to meet you
at the station house.

11:28.121 --> 11:32.231
Don't worry. They got nothing.
They got a lot of nothing.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.497
Three hours of dancing around
with her, and I got nothing.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.633
You tell her she matched up
on fingerprints?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.508
She doesn't deny
being in the room.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.007
Forensics just called.

11:42.068 --> 11:45.238
Suzy left a little something
behind with Hayashi.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.245
Her big mistake
was not taking his watch.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.248
Female pubic hair
caught in the band.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.620
I thought they got caught
on soda cans.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.849
You said she was a brunette?
Yeah.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.388
Brunettes try to look like
blondes, not vice versa.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.748
You got the wrong girl.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.729
Wait a minute, are you saying
the hair's from a blonde?

12:01.788 --> 12:03.858
Yeah, natural blonde. Sorry.

12:06.526 --> 12:10.236
I'm surprised a guy this busy
didn't die of a heart attack.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.170
Must be all the fish they eat.

12:13.266 --> 12:17.036
Last night I caught Mike in the
parking lot smashing up a Toyota.

12:17.103 --> 12:20.483
Our problem is who left their
mark on Hayashi's watch.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.610
After Suzy's out the door, where did
Hayashi find a blonde on short notice?

12:24.677 --> 12:27.207
Well, he's not gonna call a hooker
if he doesn't want to pay for it.

12:27.280 --> 12:31.420
If I wanted a date on the double, I'd
head straight for the hotel bar.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.094
Well, it was pretty busy.

12:33.152 --> 12:35.762
It was the last night
of a dentists' convention.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.802
Somebody should
give them Novocain.

12:37.857 --> 12:40.337
But is that a yes or a no
on Mr. Hayashi?

12:40.393 --> 12:41.933
Yeah, he was here
around closing.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.465
Alone, or was he with somebody?

12:43.529 --> 12:45.339
More like glued to.
A blonde.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.998
They kind of stuck out in a room
full of guys discussing drill bits.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.977
So did you get a look at her?

12:50.570 --> 12:52.410
He ordered drinks
before she got here,

12:52.472 --> 12:54.652
then they did a little
dry hump on the couch,

12:54.707 --> 12:56.147
just enough to make me puke,

12:56.209 --> 12:57.809
and they're off
to the elevators.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.617
This blonde,
you ever see her before?

12:59.679 --> 13:01.059
Maybe she was a guest here?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.724
No, I never seen her
before or since.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.093
But with her level of
enthusiasm, something tells me

13:06.152 --> 13:08.062
she works off a beeper.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.088
Half hour before she gets here,

13:10.156 --> 13:13.426
he tips me a 10 to get change
for the pay phone.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.368
Hey, 12, including the john.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.774
It'll take a couple of days to
pull IUDs from that many phones.

13:20.833 --> 13:24.043
The booking agent said Hayashi
was in town auditioning singers.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.983
Of the female variety.

13:27.507 --> 13:31.147
I put an ad in the trades, and
the headshots came pouring in.

13:31.210 --> 13:35.630
LOGAN: Look at this.
Blonde, blonde. Blonde.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.562
Hayashi had
specific requirements.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.487
I made the phone calls,
set up all the auditions.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.862
And then what?
Hayashi met all the hopefuls?

13:41.921 --> 13:45.461
The auditions were held in his hotel
room during regular business hours.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.395
What about
after business hours?

13:47.460 --> 13:48.530
I wouldn't know.

13:48.594 --> 13:49.804
Hayashi was on his own.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.742
Are these all the girls
Hayashi saw?

13:51.798 --> 13:53.738
Mostly, yeah. I kept a list.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.007
All the future Madonnas
in the five boroughs.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.384
Enjoy.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.983
Our turn to hold auditions.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.909
He saw me personally.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.857
It wasn't as much fun
as having my tonsils out.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.364
Really? We heard
he was a real charmer.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.156
Well, he was busy
charming someone else.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.862
Cell phone glued to his ear,

14:14.921 --> 14:17.271
I'm belting out Whitney
Houston's greatest hits.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.533
Turns out he's ordering lunch.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.592
And that was it?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.640
My mother's just as happy.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.695
She says I need Tokyo
like I need another kid.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.499
I wish I could help.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.808
I never even spoke to him.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.011
You are on the audition list.

14:34.073 --> 14:35.883
You see here,
it says Kristi Jakes.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.622
I'm on a lot of lists.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.087
I get plenty of work
right here singing jingles.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.216
Savmor Car Rentals?

14:41.280 --> 14:42.550
You're kidding.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.715
"Savmor, drive more."
That's you?

14:45.284 --> 14:47.494
Pay's good, I wear what I like,

14:47.553 --> 14:49.833
I don't have to worry
about men like Hayashi.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.559
Who you never met.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.558
I said like him.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.660
I know the type.

14:56.262 --> 14:58.172
"You have a nice voice."

14:58.231 --> 14:59.941
"What else can you do?"

14:59.999 --> 15:02.209
Why did you audition for it,
anyway?

15:02.268 --> 15:04.408
Well, I heard
the pay's good over there.

15:04.470 --> 15:07.920
Then I got on the list, and then
I heard it was at his hotel.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.354
No, thanks.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.175
I didn't show.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.794
I didn't even know he was dead until
my agent called me this morning.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.987
The other singers
weren't so upset about it.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.719
He wanted me in his clubs.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.255
That means I'm good.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.503
"Good" meaning you can sing?

15:23.322 --> 15:24.602
Right.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.834
My bags were packed.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.744
What, you think I want to do
temp work the rest of my life?

15:30.797 --> 15:33.107
I can only type
40 words a minute.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.500
Can I get going?

15:37.904 --> 15:40.154
IUDs from the lobby phones
came in.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.577
Here,
I got you a tuna on white.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.282
They were all out of blowfish.

15:44.343 --> 15:45.853
Arigato, baby.

15:46.312 --> 15:47.922
Got the audition list?
Mmm-hmm.

15:48.915 --> 15:52.685
Okay, I got Tiffany Bouchet.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.256
I don't see her.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.834
Angel Monroe.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.426
Heather Wayne.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.741
Kristi Jakes.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.406
Tori Bishop.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.512
No, no, no.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.370
How about Keli Konnors?

16:09.435 --> 16:11.415
K-E-I-I, Konnors with a

16:11.938 --> 16:13.538
What? Let me see that.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.476
I dated a Keli Konnors
with two "K's" once.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.277
Her real name
was Joan Kozlasky.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.792
Listen to this.

16:24.283 --> 16:25.763
Tara Harmony.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.593
Lisa Larue.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.156
Doesn't that sound bogus
to you?

16:31.224 --> 16:32.534
Stage names.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.512
I doubt that's what NYNEX
puts on their phone bills.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.572
Okay, what've we got?

16:40.132 --> 16:43.312
Shannon Gilbert's real name
is Paulette McDougal.

16:43.569 --> 16:44.669
What's wrong with that?

16:44.737 --> 16:47.837
Sounds like somebody your mother would
make you take to the senior prom.

16:47.907 --> 16:48.937
Next?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.888
Local 802 just faxed this in.

16:50.943 --> 16:51.983
More lady singers.

16:52.044 --> 16:55.254
You find anyone that can
handle opera, let me know.

16:58.651 --> 17:02.761
Dig this. Toni with an "I"
Curtis is Bernice Schwartz.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.365
Cute.
I would've remembered that.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.931
Kristi Jakes, Martha Bowen.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.266
That's the "Savmor,
drive more" lady.

17:13.332 --> 17:17.301
Martha Bowen got a phone call
from the hotel at 1:10 a.m.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.580
It doesn't mean
the call was from Hayashi.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.380
We checked the IUDs
from her apartment.

17:22.441 --> 17:25.391
Three calls to his hotel
the day of the murder.

17:25.444 --> 17:26.864
You're getting warmer.
What else?

17:26.913 --> 17:28.723
Warmer? How about broiled?

17:28.781 --> 17:32.161
A couple of months ago, Martha
Bowen got a home use permit

17:32.218 --> 17:34.458
for a GAR .22 automatic.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.020
Which is probably at the bottom
of the East River by now.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.399
Look, put her in a line-up.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.057
See what the waitress says.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.606
If she can't make a positive ID,
we've tainted her as a witness.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.202
We have the pubic hair.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.173
If it matches with Martha...

17:46.232 --> 17:48.042
We'd have enough to arrest.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.677
Okay, I'll see Judge Rivera
about a search order.

17:53.573 --> 17:57.023
All right, let's make
this fast, Counselors.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.606
I'm on
a 10-minute recess here.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.178
Invasion of privacy,
Your Honor.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.776
Plucking my client's
pubic hair.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.228
I've got it.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.293
Miss Kincaid?

18:06.185 --> 18:08.885
Same standards apply as for the
taking of any other evidence.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.295
A suspect can be compelled
to provide a blood sample.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.767
If there's probable cause.

18:12.825 --> 18:16.095
There's no evidence my client
was anywhere near Mr. Hayashi.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.402
CLAIRE: She called his hotel.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.373
A woman of her description
was seen with the victim.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.972
Your Honor, if they have an eyewitness,
why aren't we talking about that

18:23.035 --> 18:24.305
instead of a hair sample?

18:24.370 --> 18:25.510
Good point.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.921
I see
sufficient cause for both.

18:28.474 --> 18:32.294
And since it's your idea,
Mr. Hellman, it's your call.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.845
Door number one
or door number two?

18:37.683 --> 18:40.193
That's a loaded question,
Your Honor.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.786
You see,
I haven't really... I...

18:43.856 --> 18:45.836
Not to worry, Counselor.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.842
I've got your answer for you.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.803
This is your lucky day.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.029
You get to win both prizes.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.344
I think number two.

18:59.405 --> 19:02.385
She was turned away from me most of the
time, but I'm pretty sure it's her.

19:02.441 --> 19:03.551
Pretty sure is not good enough.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.519
I'll take my client home now.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.648
The forensics came in.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.712
Not so fast, Mr. Hellman.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.849
The hairs match.
We've got her.

19:12.551 --> 19:15.291
Okay, everybody who's
innocent can leave the room.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.104
Not you, sweetheart.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.696
Martha Bowen, you're under arrest
for the murder of Shiunro Hayashi.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.900
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.531
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.542
I read the indictment
backwards and forwards.

19:28.601 --> 19:33.521
I see "ifs" and "maybes" but no
evidence my client did anything wrong,

19:33.573 --> 19:36.523
unless you count being
groped in a bar as a felony.

19:36.575 --> 19:39.605
There's still the matter of a
missing .22 caliber pistol.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.719
Which my client says was stolen
from her purse two months ago.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.992
And only now it occurs to her
to report the theft.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.599
Look, she lied to the police
about meeting Hayashi.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.629
What do you expect
a jury to conclude?

19:53.159 --> 19:55.659
Conclude beyond
a reasonable doubt?

19:55.961 --> 19:57.771
You really want to find out,
Jack?

19:57.830 --> 20:00.070
I wouldn't pass up the chance.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.401
HELLMAN:
Let's talk hypotheticals.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.314
A young singer
gets called for an audition...

20:07.373 --> 20:08.413
JACK: And she brings her gun.

20:08.474 --> 20:11.514
What's her audition piece,
22 Ways To Leave Your Lover?

20:11.577 --> 20:13.677
We live in dangerous times.

20:14.113 --> 20:15.523
Can I go on?

20:16.148 --> 20:18.058
She makes nice
with her future boss.

20:18.117 --> 20:21.757
Soon as she's in his room, it's
the casting couch gone bad.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.831
He tries to rape her,
she shoots in self-defense.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.904
Then rips the phone out,
and steals his money.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.499
The phone's ripped out
in the struggle.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.471
And who's to say
there was any money?

20:30.529 --> 20:31.799
Nice try.

20:32.531 --> 20:36.981
Your client entices a man up to his
room with the purpose of robbing him.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.519
She pumps a bullet into him
and leaves him for dead.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.950
That's murder two.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.208
Really?

20:43.542 --> 20:46.652
Is that the way it'll play
to 12 red-blooded citizens,

20:46.712 --> 20:49.352
who can't tell sushi
from sukiyaki?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.562
Anything to support
their claim?

20:54.620 --> 20:58.660
If there'd been a struggle, you'd
expect to see marks on Hayashi's body.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.834
And at least there'd be Bowen's
prints all over the room.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.534
And the money?
Hasn't been recovered.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.337
She managed to post bail.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.109
With help from a Sandra Krane,
her agent.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.638
Martha Bowen gets on the
stand, says scout's honor.

21:13.539 --> 21:16.709
And we hope the jury doesn't notice
the victim is a foreign national

21:16.776 --> 21:18.806
with an overactive libido.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.748
Talk to her agent.

21:20.813 --> 21:24.283
Maybe this isn't the first time she's
had problems with an audition.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.862
See, last month Martha
averaged three sessions a week

21:29.922 --> 21:31.962
at $600 per, plus royalties...

21:32.024 --> 21:33.634
Well, darling, you do the math.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.833
Very lucky
I found her this niche.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.195
Talent doesn't count?

21:37.263 --> 21:40.373
Talent? Talent doesn't count
if you can't handle a crowd.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.813
See, Martha had stage fright.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.177
She was seeing a therapist.

21:43.235 --> 21:46.215
So she auditions to sing
in a night club in Tokyo?

21:46.272 --> 21:50.022
Well, maybe it's different if the
room doesn't speak the same language.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.146
Why didn't you ask her that
before you set up the audition?

21:52.211 --> 21:55.121
Well, I didn't ask her because she
made the appointment herself.

21:55.181 --> 21:58.861
See, American faces go at a
very high premium in Japan.

21:59.351 --> 22:02.921
A singer like Martha
can make about $5,000 a week.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.468
If I'd known
she wanted to go back there,

22:04.523 --> 22:06.633
I would've booked her
through my own contacts.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.672
She's been there before?

22:11.263 --> 22:14.873
The Japanese consulate issued a work
visa to Martha Bowen two years ago

22:14.934 --> 22:17.044
to work in one of
Hayashi's clubs.

22:17.102 --> 22:20.052
At the time, she was using the
stage name Nicolette Laine.

22:20.105 --> 22:22.875
Hayashi co-signed
her visa application.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.989
What does her lawyer
have to say about this?

22:25.044 --> 22:26.324
Well, he claims he didn't know.

22:26.378 --> 22:28.048
Sure, he didn't know.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.954
Well, maybe he's just an idiot.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.326
Is there anybody who would know
what she was doing in Japan?

22:33.385 --> 22:35.985
There's no boyfriend, no one
she talked to about it.

22:36.055 --> 22:39.695
I called her father in Duluth,
he hasn't returned my calls.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.358
Get back in touch with
the Japanese consulate.

22:41.427 --> 22:45.267
Maybe we can find another singer
who worked with her in Tokyo.

22:48.567 --> 22:49.667
DIANE: I spent a year there.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.235
It was a hoot.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.383
People were real generous.

22:53.439 --> 22:58.449
I came back with two suitcases full
of Chanel bags and Ferragamo shoes.

22:58.644 --> 23:01.284
Most singers get flowers
after a show.

23:01.847 --> 23:04.617
Well, I told my mother
I was singing.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.865
Are you saying
you became a prostitute?

23:08.921 --> 23:12.031
Look, in Japan things don't
work out the same as here.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.431
They've got customs.

23:13.492 --> 23:15.232
You go with the flow.

23:15.361 --> 23:16.671
And Martha didn't?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.299
One night, I heard she took
a swing at somebody.

23:19.365 --> 23:20.365
They had to call the cops.

23:20.432 --> 23:22.642
Even the embassy got into it.

23:23.469 --> 23:27.209
I was on the telephone to our Tokyo
embassy until 4:00 this morning.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.623
I hope we found
what you wanted.

23:29.808 --> 23:34.718
A year ago last April, Miss Bowen was
arrested for assaulting a customer

23:34.780 --> 23:36.850
at a club
where she was employed.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.286
Apparently she'd been drinking.

23:38.350 --> 23:41.920
Maybe she felt that being fondled
wasn't included in the cover charge.

23:41.987 --> 23:43.727
According to her
written statement,

23:43.789 --> 23:46.289
her real beef
was with her employer.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.858
Shiunro Hayashi?

23:48.494 --> 23:50.374
She was interrogated
by the Tokyo police

23:50.429 --> 23:52.669
in the presence
of an embassy officer.

23:52.731 --> 23:56.541
She claimed that Mr. Hayashi owed her
a few thousand dollars in back pay.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.912
She also claimed that he was
holding her passport to keep her

23:59.972 --> 24:01.652
from leaving the country.

24:01.707 --> 24:05.377
Now, we sent a letter to Mr. Hayashi
explaining that the passport

24:05.444 --> 24:08.194
was the property of the U.S. government,
and that it should be returned.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.887
And like a good boy, he did?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.159
Apparently so.

24:11.217 --> 24:14.127
The embassy never heard back
from Miss Bowen.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.690
The Tokyo police dropped the drunk
and disorderly charges against her,

24:17.756 --> 24:20.256
apparently
at Hayashi's insistence.

24:20.326 --> 24:23.356
A couple of months later, she left
Japan on a medical emergency.

24:23.429 --> 24:28.139
So Bowen waits until Hayashi's on her
home turf to settle up with him.

24:28.867 --> 24:31.247
He probably thought she just
wanted to kiss and make up.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.543
CLERK: Miss Kincaid.

24:39.378 --> 24:41.188
It's from Bowen's attorney.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.931
He's moving to suppress
the embassy report.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.364
HELLMAN: Simply put,
Your Honor,

24:50.422 --> 24:53.872
my client wasn't Mirandized
when she was arrested in Tokyo.

24:53.926 --> 24:58.026
Ergo, her statements and any report based
on those statements are inadmissible.

24:58.097 --> 25:01.867
As far as I know, Your Honor, Japan
is still a sovereign nation.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.284
Our constitutional protections
don't apply there.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.476
They do, if there's any
governmental involvement.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.452
An officer
from the U.S. embassy

25:08.507 --> 25:10.947
was present during
my client's interrogation.

25:11.477 --> 25:15.577
She was under the impression that the
officer was there as her legal counsel.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.528
What she thought
is beside the point.

25:17.583 --> 25:20.033
She was under the authority
of the Tokyo police.

25:20.085 --> 25:24.225
If you play stickball in Canarsie,
you better learn Brooklyn rules.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.270
Point well taken, Mr. McCoy.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.455
HELLMAN: This is unbelievable,
Your Honor.

25:28.627 --> 25:32.007
Illegal aliens swarm into our
country by the thousands

25:32.064 --> 25:34.484
and are immediately granted
constitutional protection.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.383
But the minute I set foot
across the border,

25:36.435 --> 25:38.005
you're saying my own government

25:38.070 --> 25:39.170
won't protect my interests?

25:39.238 --> 25:44.648
Come on, Mr. Hellman, you're arguing a
motion here, not running for Congress,

25:45.010 --> 25:46.490
and that motion is denied.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.355
The statements and the report
are admissible.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.157
What next, Jack?

25:53.218 --> 25:56.318
Drag a suspect across the nearest
border, beat a confession out of him,

25:56.388 --> 25:57.918
then use it in court?

25:58.590 --> 26:00.070
Works for me.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.867
"Right next to
Rockefeller Center,"

26:03.929 --> 26:06.809
"Pebble Beach
and the Seattle Mariners,"

26:06.865 --> 26:11.405
"add to the Japanese trophy case the U.S.
Constitution."

26:12.204 --> 26:16.154
Yep, now they have us trampling on
the rights of an American citizen

26:16.208 --> 26:17.848
to pacify the Japanese.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.860
We should let the murderer
go free so that a few bigots

26:20.913 --> 26:23.993
can stand a little taller
at the Fourth of July picnic.

26:24.750 --> 26:28.600
You don't have to be a bigot to see
that we've been taken by our friends

26:28.654 --> 26:30.264
on the other side
of the dateline.

26:30.322 --> 26:33.772
Let's not confuse Martha Bowen
with the auto industry.

26:34.393 --> 26:35.773
(PHONE BUZZING)

26:37.162 --> 26:38.232
Yes.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.080
Hellman's on his way up.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.615
Martha Bowen's
gonna get on the stand,

26:46.939 --> 26:48.439
and she's going to cry rape,

26:48.507 --> 26:52.417
or some other nonsense
about the big, bad Japanese,

26:52.845 --> 26:55.585
and you're lucky
if you get a hung jury.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.802
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:03.455 --> 27:06.795
Jack. I think
you know Mildred Kaskel.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.169
She'll be taking over
as chief counsel.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.898
I filed a notice of
substitution on the way over.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.174
I know your work, Miss Kaskel.

27:13.232 --> 27:17.652
So what's it gonna be, the feminist
version of "the Devil made me do it?"

27:18.804 --> 27:21.554
The Devil here
is your so-called victim.

27:21.807 --> 27:25.187
He viciously abused my client
while she was in Japan.

27:25.944 --> 27:29.954
I plan to introduce evidence she was
suffering from Battered Woman Syndrome

27:30.015 --> 27:31.185
when she shot him.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.630
Come again?

27:32.951 --> 27:34.931
She shot him
over a contract dispute.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.087
MILDRED: No.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.998
What happened to her in Japan
had nothing to do with singing.

27:45.697 --> 27:48.797
It was gonna be
the biggest break I ever got.

27:50.369 --> 27:54.479
Mr. Hayashi said important
people came to his club.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.484
My first week, it was
like a party every night.

27:58.744 --> 28:01.284
All these men
throwing money around.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.290
$100 for a Scotch.

28:04.717 --> 28:07.247
500 just to sit next to me.

28:09.054 --> 28:13.404
Mr. Hayashi told me
to just be nice to them.

28:14.726 --> 28:16.866
No one cared I was a singer.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.410
I wanted to go home.

28:21.800 --> 28:25.010
Mr. Hayashi said
lowed him all this money.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.950
I didn't know what to do.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.979
He had my passport.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.651
I was alone.

28:32.744 --> 28:37.094
He said I could pay him back
by being more friendly.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.360
By sleeping with his customers.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.696
I said no.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.455
He got furious.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.042
He beat me.

28:54.933 --> 28:58.283
He said if I disappeared,

28:59.071 --> 29:00.611
no one would know.

29:02.107 --> 29:03.777
No one would care.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.918
I didn't want to die.

29:10.983 --> 29:15.233
Every day she's been back, Martha's
been living in fear for her life.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.261
When she found out
Mr. Hayashi was in town,

29:18.323 --> 29:21.173
she believed he came here
looking for her.

29:21.660 --> 29:25.200
She killed him believing she
was acting in self-defense.

29:32.738 --> 29:36.578
Martha Bowen claims she killed Hayashi
because she feared for her life.

29:36.642 --> 29:38.492
It sounds irrational,
unless you believe

29:38.544 --> 29:40.924
the Battered Woman Syndrome
applies here.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.149
It's bull.

29:42.414 --> 29:45.054
It's revenge dressed up
in smoke and mirrors.

29:45.117 --> 29:49.187
Tall, blonde Miss Bowen killed
a short, dark Japanese man

29:49.254 --> 29:51.564
who was running
a white slavery operation.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.733
This is not
a Saturday morning cartoon.

29:53.792 --> 29:54.902
Yeah.

29:55.127 --> 29:59.467
Kaskel times her summation
to fall on Pearl Harbor Day,

29:59.531 --> 30:01.841
so the jury can pin a medal
on her client.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.780
She saw his ad, she called
him up, she seduced him,

30:04.837 --> 30:07.367
and she shot him
behind closed doors.

30:07.439 --> 30:08.979
She set him up.

30:09.241 --> 30:13.161
Kaskel can use the Syndrome to
justify every one of those acts.

30:16.381 --> 30:17.661
This defense,

30:19.952 --> 30:23.232
like my grandmother's
nightgown, covers everything.

30:23.555 --> 30:28.655
Just keep the jury focused on the
fact that this woman killed this man

30:28.727 --> 30:30.967
and walked off with the money.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.073
The Battered Woman Syndrome
almost exclusively applies

30:34.132 --> 30:35.742
to abused wives or girlfriends.

30:35.801 --> 30:36.941
Almost.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.182
Any woman
in any abusive relationship

30:39.237 --> 30:41.677
can display characteristics
of this syndrome.

30:41.740 --> 30:44.350
It's never been applied in a
case where the abuser was killed

30:44.409 --> 30:47.749
a year after the relationship
and the abuse ended.

30:47.813 --> 30:52.353
Let's ask some Vietnam vets about the
expiration date on stress disorders.

30:52.417 --> 30:55.917
This theory is not generally accepted
by the scientific community.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.758
Until it is, it's not a proper
subject for expert testimony.

30:58.824 --> 31:02.974
My client has the right to present
evidence to explain her conduct.

31:03.128 --> 31:07.038
She reasonably and honestly
believed her life was in danger.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.339
Mr. McCoy doesn't want
the jury to hear why.

31:09.401 --> 31:12.851
No, I don't want them confusing
Miss Bowen with the actual women

31:12.904 --> 31:14.854
this syndrome
was meant to describe.

31:14.906 --> 31:16.886
They can decide that
for themselves.

31:16.942 --> 31:21.292
Frankly, her actions seem
so far beyond understanding

31:21.346 --> 31:24.876
that I'd like to hear
her explanations myself.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.417
Then I'd like our psychiatrist
to hear them, too.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.030
I want Miss Bowen to submit
to an examination.

31:31.089 --> 31:32.159
MILDRED: No problem.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.764
But I would like the record to
show we're not required to submit.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.696
We're pleading justification.

31:36.762 --> 31:40.732
My client's reasonable beliefs are
at issue, not her state of mind.

31:40.799 --> 31:42.069
So noted.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.644
And I'll see you all in court.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.312
MARTHA: He'd never hit me
on the face.

31:51.309 --> 31:52.879
He'd twist my arm.

31:52.944 --> 31:54.984
He'd punch me in the side.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.688
At first, it was because I
wouldn't sleep with those men.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.390
But then, even after...

32:01.153 --> 32:03.293
If I didn't smile enough

32:03.522 --> 32:06.302
or if a customer complained.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.495
The smallest thing I did
wrong, I'd catch hell.

32:11.129 --> 32:14.169
Have you had any problems
since you've been back here?

32:14.533 --> 32:16.043
I can't sleep.

32:16.835 --> 32:18.815
My doctor gave me pills.

32:21.306 --> 32:22.976
It's stupid.

32:25.143 --> 32:28.423
I'm afraid if I go to sleep,
I'm gonna wake up back there.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.720
Well, how do you deal
with that fear?

32:30.782 --> 32:32.322
I bought a gun.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.560
Men are always looking at me.
It's disgusting.

32:38.056 --> 32:39.966
Do you mean all men,
or just Japanese men?

32:40.025 --> 32:42.435
Well,
the Japanese are the worst.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.067
I mean, all they're
interested in is themselves.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.939
You're there only for them,

32:46.064 --> 32:50.144
and they have a way
of looking at you.

32:50.836 --> 32:53.006
Like, I could never
get a read on them.

32:53.071 --> 32:56.311
I just...
I felt dirty and cheap.

32:57.809 --> 33:01.619
Do you have the same feelings
in your personal relationships?

33:02.981 --> 33:05.021
What, you mean boyfriends?

33:05.984 --> 33:08.264
I don't have one.

33:09.254 --> 33:10.864
I mean, I can't.

33:11.957 --> 33:13.627
You don't want to?

33:15.193 --> 33:16.833
I can't have sex.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.069
It's a medical thing.
It hurts too much.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.073
I got an infection.

33:24.436 --> 33:28.536
She's been diagnosed with chronic
pelvic inflammatory disease.

33:29.274 --> 33:32.554
She has permanent tubal
lesions, and she's sterile.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.223
I caught something from
one of those men in Japan.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.657
It's why Mr. Hayashi
let me leave

33:42.053 --> 33:44.663
MARTHA: 'cause I was no good
to him anymore.

33:46.224 --> 33:48.504
She still calls him
Mr. Hayashi.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.200
She feels her life depended
on her ability to placate him.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.903
It's the heart of the syndrome.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.954
It doesn't bother you that
she never mentioned abuse,

33:56.001 --> 33:58.851
or the word "prostitute"
to the United States embassy?

33:58.904 --> 34:02.554
You want the statistics
on unreported spousal abuse?

34:02.774 --> 34:04.454
However Martha Bowen
came about it,

34:04.509 --> 34:06.389
she walks and talks
like a battered woman.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.315
She's a textbook case.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.456
A battered wife
kills her husband.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.692
I abhor it,
but I can sympathize.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.739
But from the moment that she
set foot in this country,

34:21.793 --> 34:24.402
Martha Bowen was free
and clear of Hayashi.

34:24.462 --> 34:28.601
You have no idea what it's like to
be victimized by a powerful man.

34:28.733 --> 34:33.652
So you want to create a new category
of self-defense just for women?

34:33.705 --> 34:37.475
You might as well say we're by nature
incapable of controlling our emotions.

34:37.542 --> 34:40.152
I doubt that's what
Gloria Steinem had in mind.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.351
That is not what I'm saying.

34:42.947 --> 34:47.558
But, Jack, if you put me on the stand,
I have to stick to my diagnosis.

34:48.485 --> 34:50.755
Fine. You're not testifying.

34:51.755 --> 34:54.696
I wanted her mental condition,
not your emotional reaction.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.639
If you think vengeance
belongs in the penal code,

34:57.762 --> 35:00.572
then you don't belong
on my witness list.

35:10.075 --> 35:11.985
What do you want to do?

35:17.849 --> 35:19.759
Maybe it is a textbook case.

35:19.818 --> 35:23.098
Let's have the police take
a look at Bowen's apartment.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.694
See what she keeps
on her bookshelf.

35:28.193 --> 35:31.203
Enough Is Enough:
Battered Women Fight Back.

35:32.330 --> 35:35.540
Defending Her Life: A Battered
Woman Tells Her Story.

35:35.600 --> 35:40.050
Kill Or Be Killed: Self-Defense
And The Battered Wife Syndrome.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.682
All with highlighted passages.

35:44.276 --> 35:48.746
You know, 15 years ago, a serial
killer named Kenneth Bianchi

35:49.581 --> 35:53.861
almost convinced a team of doctors
that he had multiple personalities.

35:55.787 --> 35:58.227
You think Martha's
a better actor?

35:59.324 --> 36:01.304
She's done the homework.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.496
He kept one hand free for his drink,
and the other hand was in her lap

36:08.567 --> 36:09.767
or on her chest.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.784
And how was
the defendant behaving?

36:11.836 --> 36:14.746
She had her arm around him
and she was smiling.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.686
Did she do anything to make you
think she wasn't enjoying herself?

36:17.742 --> 36:21.422
No. It looked to me like the
current was running both ways,

36:21.479 --> 36:24.219
and when they left
they were arm in arm.

36:25.216 --> 36:26.556
Thank you.

36:28.420 --> 36:32.200
You said you were working
a full bar that night?

36:33.525 --> 36:36.995
So how could you possibly be aware
of everything that transpired

36:37.062 --> 36:39.632
between Mr. Hayashi
and his companion?

36:39.931 --> 36:41.211
I didn't say I was.

36:41.266 --> 36:43.296
And when you picked my client
out of a lineup,

36:43.368 --> 36:46.608
you said you were pretty sure
she was the woman at the bar?

36:46.771 --> 36:47.811
Yeah.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.882
So now when you say there
was current running both ways,

36:50.942 --> 36:53.752
are you dead certain
or are you just pretty sure?

36:54.613 --> 36:55.823
I don't know.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.880
I'm just telling you
how it looked.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.189
Thank you.

36:59.884 --> 37:03.204
During the last 15 years,
I've investigated 48 cases

37:03.255 --> 37:06.195
where a battered woman
has killed her abuser.

37:06.424 --> 37:10.274
Nine times out of 10, when we get to
the scene, the woman's waiting for us.

37:10.328 --> 37:11.708
And the other 10%?

37:11.763 --> 37:13.303
The woman runs
to a family member,

37:13.365 --> 37:16.135
or we find her wandering
in the neighborhood.

37:16.201 --> 37:19.081
In any of these cases, did the
women try to cover up their crime?

37:19.137 --> 37:22.277
No. These women
are not acting rationally.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.341
They're in a state of shock.

37:24.409 --> 37:28.149
So, no pulling out the phone cord, no
effort to make it look like a robbery?

37:28.213 --> 37:29.823
No, nothing like that.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.221
Thank you.

37:33.618 --> 37:38.228
Detective, you said that these
women were acting irrationally.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.400
In other words, their
behavior was unpredictable?

37:41.459 --> 37:43.959
In general,
you know what to expect.

37:44.029 --> 37:47.839
So you could have predicted that an
abused woman named Lorena Bobbitt

37:47.899 --> 37:52.369
would be found driving down the highway
with her husband's penis in her hand?

37:52.437 --> 37:54.677
No, I guess I missed that one.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.080
Thank you.

37:57.375 --> 38:00.845
The women I studied had to live with
the fear that they might be killed

38:00.912 --> 38:03.762
or take drastic action
to save themselves.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.895
You spent a year
at Tokyo University.

38:07.252 --> 38:09.162
What was the nature
of your work?

38:09.220 --> 38:12.170
I studied the exploitation
of women in Japan.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.327
It's a perfect model
of a male-dominated society...

38:14.392 --> 38:16.842
Objection.
This is all irrelevant.

38:21.633 --> 38:25.913
My client was trapped in a culture where
wives still walk behind their husbands.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.880
Now that's relevant to understanding
her feelings of helplessness.

38:28.940 --> 38:32.350
This witness is qualified as an
expert on the abuse of women,

38:32.410 --> 38:34.220
not on Japan bashing.

38:34.379 --> 38:37.549
I'm going to allow some
latitude here, Mr. McCoy.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.727
The witness may finish
with her answer.

38:42.854 --> 38:46.274
Japan is a perfect model
of a male-dominated society

38:46.324 --> 38:49.704
that has a poor record of
respecting the rights of women.

38:49.761 --> 38:54.711
So how would you characterize the
attitude of the typical Japanese male

38:54.766 --> 38:56.576
toward Western women?

38:56.735 --> 38:59.305
They're a status symbol
for Japanese men.

38:59.370 --> 39:00.410
How's that?

39:00.472 --> 39:03.612
In the past, they felt
intimidated by Western women.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.945
That these women now serve
Japanese men is a sign to them

39:07.012 --> 39:08.862
of Japan's rise in the world.

39:08.913 --> 39:10.293
Thank you.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.615
Let's get back to your stated
area of expertise.

39:14.619 --> 39:18.529
Does every abused woman develop
Battered Woman Syndrome?

39:18.723 --> 39:20.463
They all show signs of it.

39:20.525 --> 39:24.665
Does that mean that every abused
woman eventually kills her abuser?

39:24.729 --> 39:26.829
No, there is no hard
and fast rule.

39:26.898 --> 39:27.898
There's no cause and effect?

39:27.966 --> 39:30.876
First you look at the behavior, and
then you see if it fits the pattern.

39:30.935 --> 39:33.345
So first you have the crime, and
then you look for the excuse?

39:33.405 --> 39:34.745
Objection.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.323
Withdrawn.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.876
Everything cuts both ways.

39:44.682 --> 39:47.862
What we call premeditation,
they call a syndrome.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.902
I can't believe anybody
on that jury's gonna buy it.

39:50.955 --> 39:53.485
It's all gonna boil down
to race.

39:54.993 --> 39:58.633
Abuse is just something for the
jury to hang their hat on.

39:58.863 --> 40:01.713
You wanna do the cross
on Bowen tomorrow?

40:01.966 --> 40:04.406
Because of my skills
or my gender?

40:04.769 --> 40:05.869
Both.

40:07.505 --> 40:08.945
Claire, I want to win.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.347
So do you.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.160
MARTHA:
He was always on me.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.559
He said my chest was too small.

40:21.686 --> 40:23.356
He said I smelled.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.302
All Americans smell bad.

40:27.325 --> 40:29.665
I could never do
anything right.

40:31.362 --> 40:35.572
I started believing that all I
was good for was being a whore.

40:38.203 --> 40:42.883
And after you came home,
what happened?

40:43.608 --> 40:46.678
Every day I was afraid
he was going to show up.

40:47.645 --> 40:49.085
It's why I changed
my stage name.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.457
I knew he had the money
to find me.

40:51.516 --> 40:55.156
But why would he,
when he sent you home?

40:56.654 --> 41:00.804
Maybe deep down
I thought it was crazy,

41:01.626 --> 41:04.296
but I felt trapped,

41:05.063 --> 41:07.303
like I couldn't run anymore.

41:07.899 --> 41:11.349
I had to do something
to stop him.

41:14.739 --> 41:16.309
What did you do?

41:17.675 --> 41:20.615
I met with him,
just to tell him how I felt.

41:21.279 --> 41:25.519
In the bar, when he started touching
me, I was afraid to say anything.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.395
He wanted to go back
to his room.

41:30.555 --> 41:32.685
I don't know why I said yes.

41:33.458 --> 41:38.268
We got there, and just
the way he looked at me,

41:38.763 --> 41:40.643
like I was nothing...

41:42.133 --> 41:44.883
I was afraid
of what he was gonna do.

41:46.971 --> 41:48.881
The gun was in my hand.

41:51.876 --> 41:54.576
I don't know what I did next.
It's just a blur.

41:59.717 --> 42:00.887
Thank you.

42:01.753 --> 42:05.503
Miss Bowen, during your
examination by Dr. Olivet,

42:05.657 --> 42:10.827
you stated, quote, "The smallest
thing I did wrong, I'd catch hell."

42:11.296 --> 42:13.206
Do you remember that statement?

42:13.264 --> 42:14.334
Yes.

42:14.432 --> 42:17.172
Miss Bowen,
do you recognize these books?

42:18.803 --> 42:19.843
Yes.

42:19.904 --> 42:21.884
I'm referring to People's
18 through 20.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.890
These books were found
in your apartment.

42:23.941 --> 42:26.511
This one's titled
Defending Her Life:

42:26.578 --> 42:29.078
A Battered Woman
Tells Her Story.

42:29.147 --> 42:32.887
Please read this passage, the
one with the orange highlight.

42:38.423 --> 42:40.463
"I couldn't do anything right."

42:41.426 --> 42:44.166
"Every little thing I did
wrong, he'd punch me."

42:48.599 --> 42:50.409
Now, please read
this passage from

42:50.468 --> 42:53.778
Enough Is Enough:
Battered Women Fight Back.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.740
"I stood over him
while he slept."

42:59.210 --> 43:02.710
"I wanted to make him feel the
way I felt when he beat me."

43:02.780 --> 43:04.690
"The gun was in my hand."

43:06.918 --> 43:08.958
Please continue reading.

43:12.056 --> 43:13.756
"I was nothing to him."

43:13.825 --> 43:16.825
"I had to do something
to stop the pain."

43:19.997 --> 43:22.567
Miss Bowen?
You don't understand.

43:23.501 --> 43:26.541
Just look
what he did to me. Look.

43:27.071 --> 43:29.071
What else was I gonna do?

43:31.476 --> 43:33.976
"The jury is instructed that
it may consider this evidence"

43:34.045 --> 43:37.045
"only as it relates
to consciousness of guilt."

43:38.016 --> 43:39.886
Are we agreed on the language?

43:39.951 --> 43:41.161
Fine with me.

43:41.219 --> 43:42.489
No problem here.

43:42.553 --> 43:43.663
Good.

43:43.888 --> 43:48.098
Next point, "The jury may not consider
the victim's background or origins"

43:48.159 --> 43:50.159
"in making
its determination."

43:50.328 --> 43:51.528
That's not sufficient,
Your Honor.

43:51.596 --> 43:53.836
This case demands
a much stronger statement.

43:53.898 --> 43:55.568
It's funny
how we completely disagree.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.483
I want the jury to consider
all the factors that effect

43:58.536 --> 44:01.846
my client's reasonable belief
that her life was in danger.

44:01.940 --> 44:05.910
You'd also like to pack the jury with
the widows of World War ll veterans.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.147
That's the sum total
of her case, Your Honor.

44:08.212 --> 44:12.022
If this victim were white, Miss Bowen
would have taken a plea months ago.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.563
Now, let's stay focused,
Mr. McCoy.

44:14.786 --> 44:19.626
With all due respect, Your Honor,
you know what people can feel

44:19.690 --> 44:22.330
about certain minorities
in this city.

44:23.027 --> 44:25.737
Racism poisons practically
every trial we see here.

44:25.797 --> 44:28.107
Mr. McCoy is talking
in generalities.

44:28.166 --> 44:33.006
And the defense would like to turn
the jury into a panel of racists.

44:34.405 --> 44:36.535
The court must take a stand.

44:37.942 --> 44:40.222
All right,
let me see what you have.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.798
And lastly, I will
instruct you as follows.

44:52.123 --> 44:57.733
You may not consider Mr. Hayashi's
race or country of origin

44:57.996 --> 45:00.936
or prior acts
when making your decision.

45:02.266 --> 45:05.436
I instruct you this
as a matter of law.

45:06.804 --> 45:13.054
Your duty is to pass judgment on
Martha Bowen, not on the victim.

45:13.811 --> 45:16.221
And your personal feelings
about the Japanese people,

45:16.280 --> 45:18.850
their culture,
or their government

45:20.818 --> 45:23.818
has no place in a jury room.

45:25.056 --> 45:29.526
You swore an oath to put aside
such considerations.

45:30.495 --> 45:35.135
I instruct you now
to live up to that oath,

45:36.200 --> 45:37.580
and I thank you.

45:39.971 --> 45:42.651
Madam Foreman, has the jury
reached a verdict?

45:42.707 --> 45:44.407
Yes, Your Honor, we have.

45:44.475 --> 45:47.385
On the sole count of the indictment,
murder in the Second Degree,

45:47.445 --> 45:48.515
how do you find?

45:48.579 --> 45:50.859
We find the defendant
not guilty.

45:51.949 --> 45:54.429
The jury is dismissed.
Court is adjourned.

46:10.034 --> 46:11.884
Mr. Nakahara, I'm sorry.

46:12.103 --> 46:15.783
I was in the Midwest last year for
the opening of an auto plant.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.750
4,000 new jobs.

46:17.942 --> 46:21.052
When I left,
someone threw paint on my car.

46:21.345 --> 46:24.015
It was disturbing,
but expected.

46:30.054 --> 46:33.764
My guess, tomorrow the papers will call
this a victory for women's rights.

46:33.824 --> 46:36.964
Yeah. And a giant leap
for ignorance.
