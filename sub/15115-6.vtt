WEBVTT

00:00.881 --> 00:03.043
‐ <i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BUNHEADS"...
</i>‐ Truly: <i>YOU'RE HER.</i>

00:03.043 --> 00:05.676
‐ I'M...?
‐ THE POLE DANCER FROM RENO.

00:05.676 --> 00:07.588
I'M NOT A POLE DANCER.
WHO SAID I WAS A POLE DANCER?

00:07.588 --> 00:09.126
‐ WHO ARE YOU?
‐ SHE IS MY DAUGHTER‐IN‐LAW.

00:09.126 --> 00:11.972
THEY GOT MARRIED
IN LAS VEGAS.

00:11.972 --> 00:13.125
‐ HI, TALIA.
‐ TELL ME EVERYTHING.

00:13.125 --> 00:17.017
WE GOT HERE,
HE GOT IN A CAR ACCIDENT
AND NOW HE'S DEAD.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.269
‐ YOU SHOULD GO UP FRONT TODAY.
‐ WHAT? NO.

00:19.269 --> 00:22.232
‐ COME ON!
‐ I DON'T STAND IN
THE FRONT, MELANIE, EVER.

00:22.232 --> 00:24.144
WELL, YOU SHOULD TODAY.

00:24.144 --> 00:26.607
SO YOU CAN DANCE
IN FRONT OF MY BROTHER.

00:26.607 --> 00:28.145
<i>IF CHARLIE
WANTS TO NOTICE ME,
HE CAN NOTICE ME BACK HERE.</i>

00:28.145 --> 00:30.147
‐ IN THE BACK.
‐ HE'S NOT THAT OBSERVANT.

00:30.147 --> 00:33.994
‐ I THINK MY DAD'S GAY.
‐ BASED ON WHAT?

00:33.994 --> 00:35.415
JUST A FEELING.

00:35.415 --> 00:37.141
HE WON'T COME OUT.
THINKS IT'S A GIANT SECRET

00:37.141 --> 00:39.960
BUT EVERYONE KNOWS.
IT'S TOO BAD‐‐

00:39.960 --> 00:42.146
THERE'S SOME LOVELY
SINGLE GAY MEN IN THIS TOWN.

00:42.146 --> 00:46.146
AND SASHA WOULD BE
SO MUCH HAPPIER IF HE
SMILED ONCE IN A WHILE.

00:46.146 --> 00:49.153
IT'S PRETTY LATE.
DO YOU PARENTS KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE?

00:49.153 --> 00:52.432
‐ NOPE!
‐ Fanny: <i>AND IT WAS FUN!</i>

00:52.432 --> 00:55.556
<i>PUTTING IT TOGETHER,
WORKING WITH THE KIDS.</i>

00:56.887 --> 00:59.680
JUST BECAUSE YOU TEACH
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OVER.

01:03.143 --> 01:04.735
Michelle: <i>HEY!</i>

01:04.735 --> 01:08.068
DID SOMEONE
SEE THE VIRGIN MARY
IN THE ROSIN BOX AGAIN?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.173
ONE TIME AND I NEVER
SAID I WAS SURE.

01:09.173 --> 01:12.032
‐ THE DOOR'S LOCKED.
‐ RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO

01:12.032 --> 01:13.181
WHEN THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO COME IN AND TOUCH
THEIR STUFF.

01:13.181 --> 01:17.157
CLASS IS AT 10:00 AND IT'S
ALWAYS OPEN A HALF HOUR EARLY
SO WE CAN WARM UP.

01:17.157 --> 01:20.000
‐ IS FANNY IN THERE?
‐ WHY WOULD SHE BE IN THERE
IF IT'S LOCKED?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.833
‐ WELL, MAYBE SHE DIDN'T
UNLOCK IT FOR A REASON.
‐ WHAT REASON?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.835
MAYBE SHE'S TESTING TO SEE

01:24.835 --> 01:26.707
HOW DEDICATED
YOU ARE TO BALLET.

01:26.707 --> 01:28.338
‐ WHAT?
‐ HOW BAD YOU WANT IT.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.801
‐ WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
‐ WELL, THE DOOR IS LOCKED

01:30.801 --> 01:32.204
AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET
MORE BALLET IS TO FIND
ANOTHER WAY IN.

01:32.204 --> 01:35.212
ARE YOU WILLING TO DIG A TUNNEL
UNDER THE STUDIO WITH NOTHING
BUT A PLASTIC SPOON,

01:35.212 --> 01:39.309
AND THEN CUT A GIANT HOLE
IN THE FLOOR WITH THE CHAIN SAW
YOU DRAGGED ALONG,

01:39.309 --> 01:42.643
AND THEN ONCE INSIDE,
REPAIR THE FLOOR WITH NOTHING
MORE THAN A GLUE GUN,

01:42.643 --> 01:44.204
SOME BOBBY PINS
AND YOUR WITS?

01:44.204 --> 01:46.987
WELL, I SEE
SHE HAS HER ANSWER.

01:46.987 --> 01:49.530
‐ PLEASE DON'T WAIT
WITH US ANYMORE.
‐ OKAY FINE.

01:51.572 --> 01:53.654
‐ FANNY!
‐ OH GEE, CALLING OUT!

01:53.654 --> 01:55.232
‐ WE SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT.
‐ HEY, YOU'D BETTER WATCH IT.

01:55.232 --> 01:58.230
WITH SNARK LIKE THAT
YOU'LL WIND UP WITH YOUR OWN
DIRTY‐GIRL SITCOM ON N. B. C.

01:58.230 --> 02:00.871
‐ I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
‐ WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

02:00.871 --> 02:02.226
TO FIND YOU A TEACHER,
GRASSHOPPER.

02:07.247 --> 02:09.249
‐ Woman: <i>I LIKED IT.
</i>‐ Woman #2: <i>YOU DID?</i>

02:09.249 --> 02:10.460
‐ I DID.
‐ BUT WHY?

02:10.460 --> 02:12.843
THE EMOTIONAL STRUGGLE
BETWEEN RIGHT OR WRONG?

02:12.843 --> 02:14.805
A WOMAN WRESTLING
WITH HER OWN IDENTITY?

02:14.805 --> 02:16.677
‐ 'CAUSE IT'S DIRTY.
‐ WHAT?

02:16.677 --> 02:18.388
I LIKE MY BOOKS DIRTY.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.971
‐ I NEED A BETTER
REASON THAN THAT.
‐ I DO NOT HAVE ONE.

02:20.971 --> 02:22.263
IT'S A NATIONAL PHENOMENON.
THAT'S A REASON.

02:22.263 --> 02:25.475
‐ <i>NOT</i> TO READ A BOOK.
‐ LOOK, I DON'T NEED A REASON.

02:25.475 --> 02:28.569
WHEN JUDY BLUME PUT OUT
THAT BOOK "WIFEY," I WAS
FIRST IN LINE TO BUY IT.

02:28.569 --> 02:30.320
WHY? IT'S DIRTY.
THE WOMAN WHO GAVE YOU

02:30.320 --> 02:32.983
"ARE YOU THERE GOD?
IT'S ME, MARGARET"
WRITES A DIRTY BOOK,

02:32.983 --> 02:35.365
I'M GOING TO READ IT.
TWICE‐‐ ONCE TO MY KID.

02:35.365 --> 02:37.037
‐ OH GOD. TRULY?
‐ <i>HUH?</i>

02:37.037 --> 02:40.240
‐ WHAT ABOUT YOU?
‐ OH WELL, I HAVEN'T
FINISHED IT YET.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.953
‐ WHY NOT?
‐ I'M HAVING THE TILE
IN MY BATHROOM RE‐DONE

02:42.953 --> 02:45.045
AND I DIDN'T WANT THE WORKMEN
TO SEE IT LAYING OUT,

02:45.045 --> 02:47.247
SO I THOUGHT
I'D PUT IT IN THE GARAGE,
BUT IT'S NOT ATTACHED,

02:47.247 --> 02:49.290
<i>SO I WALKED OUTSIDE
AND MY NEIGHBOR WALKED BY
WITH HIS DOG AND I PANICKED</i>

02:49.290 --> 02:53.423
AND THREW IT IN THE TRASH.
WE TALKED FOR A WHILE AND
I WENT BACK INSIDE TO WAIT,

02:53.423 --> 02:55.465
BUT HIS DOG IS OLD
AND TAKES A LONG TIME TO‐‐

02:55.465 --> 02:57.277
ANYHOW, I FELL ASLEEP
AND THE NEXT MORNING
WAS TRASH DAY SO‐‐

02:57.277 --> 03:00.891
‐ HEY.
‐ YOU THREW AWAY
OUR READING ASSIGNMENT?

03:00.891 --> 03:03.103
‐ NOT ON PURPOSE.
‐ BOOK CLUBS HAVE RULES, TRULY.

03:03.103 --> 03:05.185
‐ I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
‐ WHAT BOOK ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.290
‐ "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY."
‐ GREAT.

03:06.290 --> 03:09.189
SORRY TO INTERRUPT THE END
OF LITERATURE AS WE KNOW IT,

03:09.189 --> 03:11.271
‐ BUT HAS ANYONE SEEN FANNY?
‐ OH!

03:11.271 --> 03:13.774
AM I SUPPOSED TO‐‐

03:13.774 --> 03:14.294
RIGHT.

03:16.486 --> 03:18.278
THAT'S QUITE A GATHERING
YOU'VE GOT THERE.

03:18.278 --> 03:20.240
‐ WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
‐ NOTHING.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.242
SO ARE YOU THE OFFICIAL
LIFE‐ALERT PUSHER?

03:22.242 --> 03:24.494
‐ THOSE WOMEN ARE SMART
AND SKILLED.
‐ AND OLD.

03:24.494 --> 03:27.037
‐ THEY ARE NOT OLD.
‐ COMPARED TO YOU
AND METHUSELAH.

03:27.037 --> 03:29.039
I FIND THEIR CONVERSATION
STIMULATING.

03:29.039 --> 03:32.172
Woman:
<i>TRULY, WHAT KIND OF STONE DID
YOUR UNCLE PASS LAST WEEK?</i>

03:32.172 --> 03:33.834
‐ KIDNEY!
‐ NOT GALLSTONE?

03:33.834 --> 03:35.327
NO, KIDNEY.
THERE'S A PICTURE
OF IT ON MY PHONE!

03:35.327 --> 03:37.337
‐ WOW.
‐ SHUT UP.

03:37.337 --> 03:39.890
GONNA REMINISCE ABOUT
THE DAYS WHEN A CUP OF COFFEE

03:39.890 --> 03:41.512
‐ COST TWO BITS?
‐ IT'S A BOOK CLUB.

03:41.512 --> 03:42.326
‐ YOU DIDN'T READ THE BOOK.
‐ SO?

03:42.326 --> 03:45.556
SO YOU'RE HANGING
WITH THE NICKEL‐SLOT
CROWD, TRULY.

03:45.556 --> 03:48.438
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
STAY HOME ALONE, BUY CATS
ON THE INTERNET?

03:48.438 --> 03:51.441
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO OUT
WITH PEOPLE YOUR OWN AGE,
DO FUN THINGS.

03:51.441 --> 03:53.233
‐ MEET GUYS.
‐ YOU WANT ME TO BE
A SLUT LIKE YOU?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.405
YES, I GET
A COUPON TO SIZZLER
FOR EVERY CONVERT.

03:55.405 --> 03:57.447
THANK YOU FOR THE ADVICE,
BUT THOSE ARE MY FRIENDS.

03:57.447 --> 03:59.820
I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR YOU TO HANG OUT
WITH PEOPLE

03:59.820 --> 04:01.341
WHO REMEMBER SHAUN CASSIDY
AND NOT JACK CASSIDY.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.243
‐ HERE.
‐ WHAT IS THIS?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.344
‐ IT'S FROM FANNY.
‐ FANNY? WHERE IS SHE?

04:04.344 --> 04:06.363
‐ JUST READ IT.
‐ TRULY, THERE'S
A CLASS FULL OF KIDS

04:06.363 --> 04:09.960
‐ LOCKED OUTSIDE
THE DANCE STUDIO.
‐ KEYS ARE IN THE ENVELOPE.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.421
‐ BUT‐‐ UGH.
‐ READ THE NOTE.

04:11.421 --> 04:14.294
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT
LIKE ME AND ACCEPT ME.

04:14.294 --> 04:17.087
THESE WOMEN FIND ME INTERESTING
AND INVITED ME INTO THEIR CLUB.

04:17.087 --> 04:20.591
AND YES, MAYBE THAT MEANS I HAVE
TO READ A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE,
SIMPLY AWFUL, DREADFUL BOOK,

04:20.591 --> 04:22.374
BUT AT THE END
OF THAT BOOK IS CAKE...
AND FRIENDSHIP,

04:22.374 --> 04:26.807
‐ WHICH IS, I'M SURE, SOMETHING
YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND.
‐ I UNDERSTAND CAKE.

04:28.889 --> 04:31.061
CELIA NEEDS HER MYLANTA.

04:38.198 --> 04:39.396
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

04:58.406 --> 05:01.421
‐ YOU'RE GONE?
‐ <i>I'm not gone, I still exist.</i>

05:01.421 --> 05:03.407
‐ <i>I'm just not there.
</i> WITHOUT SAYING A WORD.

05:03.407 --> 05:06.426
‐ I LEFT YOU A NOTE.
‐ YOU LEFT TRULY A NOTE.

05:06.426 --> 05:08.408
I KNEW YOU'D COME
SOMETHING FROM ME EVENTUALLY.

05:08.408 --> 05:11.101
‐ NOT FAIR.
‐ <i>What did you mooch?</i>

05:11.101 --> 05:14.024
NOTHING.
OUTSIDE THE STUDIO TO COME IN.

05:14.024 --> 05:16.436
‐ WHAT'S THE POINT, MICHELLE?
‐ THE POINT IS YOU HAVE CLASSES!

05:16.436 --> 05:18.649
I KNOW.
THAT YOU'RE THERE,

05:18.649 --> 05:20.861
SO I CAN GET AWAY FOR A WEEK
AND THEN YOU CAN TEACH THEM.

05:20.861 --> 05:24.535
‐ WHAT?
<i>I have a little help. or once</i>

05:24.535 --> 05:28.328
IT'S GLORIOUS THAT FINALLY
A WOMAN IN HER TWILIGHT YEARS

05:28.328 --> 05:31.662
WHO HASN'T HAD A VACATION
SINCE EISENHOWER WAS IN OFFICE

05:31.662 --> 05:34.434
CAN, JUST FOR A SMALL MOMENT
IN TIME, GET AWAY,

05:34.434 --> 05:36.440
RELAX, RECHARGE.

05:36.440 --> 05:40.010
AND ALL WHILE
A YOUNG VIBRANT WOMAN

05:40.010 --> 05:42.459
WHO NORMALLY DOES NOTHING
BRANGELINA'S WEDDINGVER

05:42.459 --> 05:46.466
‐ CAN TAKE OVER.
HOW MANY KIDS THEY HAVE?

05:46.466 --> 05:48.769
TAKE A WALK! BUY A RING!
EAT SOME CAKE! IT'S TIME.

05:48.769 --> 05:50.731
‐ I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
‐ BUT I CAN'T TEACH.

05:50.731 --> 05:52.683
‐ I HAVE PLANS THIS WEEKEND.
‐ WHAT PLANS?

05:52.683 --> 05:56.026
MY FRIEND TALIA IS
CELEBRATING MY BIRTHDAY. WE'RE

05:56.026 --> 05:58.779
WE HAVE THIS WHOLE WEEKEND
IT'S GONNA BE BIG.

05:58.779 --> 06:00.611
‐ MMM.
‐ <i>What?</i>

06:00.611 --> 06:03.824
HAVEN'T WE PASSED THE AGE
WHERE WE ACKNOWLEDGE BIRTHDAYS?

06:03.824 --> 06:05.656
NO, WE DIDN'T THINK SO.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.789
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE SAD‐‐
A WOMAN OF YOUR AGE?

06:08.789 --> 06:09.481
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM?

06:09.481 --> 06:13.043
ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY.
I GUESS IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE

06:13.043 --> 06:15.045
A BIRTHDAY PARTY LIKE
AN EIGHT‐YEAR‐OLD,

06:15.045 --> 06:16.497
AND WEAR A CINDERELLA COSTUME
AND A TIARA...

06:16.497 --> 06:21.301
‐ ONE YEAR!
DO THAT ALL THAT AT NIGHT. LD

06:21.301 --> 06:22.963
‐ BUT...
‐ <i>Classes are during the day.</i>

06:22.963 --> 06:24.492
‐ BUT...
<i>sit vigil at the studio.</i>

06:24.492 --> 06:28.509
I'M JUST SAYING THAT FOR ONCE
LET AN OLD WOMAN MEDITATE

06:28.509 --> 06:32.513
ON THE FINAL MOMENTS SHE HAS
LEFT IN THIS EARTHLY REALM.

06:33.724 --> 06:36.066
( sighs )
WHAT'S WITH THE POLE?

06:36.066 --> 06:38.018
AH YES.
IT'S A BEAUTY, ISN'T IT?

06:38.018 --> 06:41.021
I GOT TO THINKING
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.

06:41.021 --> 06:45.115
AND WHEN YOU WENT
ON AND ON ABOUT THAT
CARDIO‐STRIPTEASE CLASS,

06:45.115 --> 06:46.827
WELL, THE IDEA JUST STUCK.

06:46.827 --> 06:48.909
WHEN DID I GO ON AND ON ABOUT
CARDIO‐STRIPTEASE CLASSES?

06:48.909 --> 06:49.910
‐ <i>The other day.
</i>‐ NO.

06:49.910 --> 06:50.911
‐ <i>Yes.
</i>‐ NO.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.912
‐ <i>Night?
</i>‐ NO.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.514
OH, I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS FERGIE.

06:53.514 --> 06:57.377
ANYHOW, THE IDEA STUCK
AND I JUST ORDERED THE POLE.

06:57.377 --> 07:00.300
‐ WHEN WERE YOU
TALKING TO FERGIE?
‐ SHE MENTIONED IT ON "LENO."

07:00.300 --> 07:01.522
ANYHOW, IT'S A VERY HOT TREND.

07:01.522 --> 07:06.216
IT'S FUN AND SEXY
AND VERY POPULAR
WITH THE HOUSEWIVES.

07:06.216 --> 07:08.679
‐ LIKE THE TV SHOW?
‐ NO, ACTUAL HOUSEWIVES.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.221
‐ THOSE STILL EXIST?
‐ AND THEY LIKE TO SLIDE
ON POLES.

07:11.221 --> 07:14.224
OKAY, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO
TEACH A CARDIO‐STRIPTEASE CLASS.

07:14.224 --> 07:16.476
THERE'S A DVD AND A BOOK.
THEY CAME WITH THE POLE.

07:16.476 --> 07:18.979
‐ ( sarcastically ) OH GOODY.
‐ <i>You'll learn the routine,</i>

07:18.979 --> 07:20.553
AND THEN LIVEN IT UP IN YOUR
OWN MICHELLE WAY, I'M SURE.

07:20.553 --> 07:23.984
YOU MEAN WITH SARCASM
AND GENERAL HOSTILITY
TOWARD THE WORLD?

07:23.984 --> 07:26.026
I THINK IT'S GOING
TO BE VERY POPULAR.

07:26.026 --> 07:29.409
I PUT A SIGN‐UP
SHEET AT THE OYSTER BAR
FOR ONE FREE CLASS,

07:29.409 --> 07:31.556
AND BY THE TIME RICO BROUGHT
MY COFFEE THE SHEET WAS FULL.

07:31.556 --> 07:34.705
‐ <i>Yeah, but, Fanny‐‐
</i>‐ ENJOY YOUR BIRTHDAY.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.997
DON'T TAKE PICTURES.

07:40.420 --> 07:43.043
( sighs )
OKAY, WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT,

07:43.043 --> 07:45.636
BLAME FERGIE.
EVERYONE AT THE BARRE.

07:53.595 --> 07:55.588
‐ Ginny: TOUCH IT.
‐ NO WAY.

07:55.588 --> 07:58.579
BOO, YOU'RE EXPOSED
TO THIS STUFF ALL THE TIME.
YOU WORK HERE. TRY IT.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.562
NUH‐UH,
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE.

08:01.562 --> 08:03.443
IT'S FRIED.
HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

08:07.317 --> 08:09.660
‐ SO?
‐ CAN YOU SPEAK?

08:09.660 --> 08:11.782
‐ IS IT VEGETABLE?
‐ IT'S PROBABLY CLAMS.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.606
MEL, JUST FORM WORDS.
GO ON‐‐ WORDS.

08:13.606 --> 08:16.286
'CAUSE THERE'S LOTS
OF CLAMS BACK THERE.

08:16.286 --> 08:18.248
I THINK SHE'S TRYING
TO SAY SOMETHING.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.380
I THINK SHE'S SIGNALING
FOR A MERCY KILLING.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.252
IS HER FACE TURNING
A WEIRD COLOR?

08:22.252 --> 08:23.834
<i>OKAY, WHATEVER.</i>

08:23.834 --> 08:25.606
SO BE AT MY HOUSE
AT 7:00 TONIGHT.
THE MOVIE STARTS AT 10:00.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.088
AND YOUR PARENTS WILL
DEFINITELY BE GONE?

08:28.088 --> 08:30.681
MY MOM HAS
AN OUT‐OF‐TOWN CONFERENCE,
SHE'S DRAGGING MY DAD ALONG.

08:30.681 --> 08:34.094
WE'RE LOOKING AT $60
FOOD ALLOWANCE AND COMPLETE
FREEDOM TILL SUNDAY NIGHT.

08:34.094 --> 08:37.848
I LOVE THE MOVIE TRUCK‐‐
HITTING DIFFERENT TOWNS
ON DIFFERENT NIGHTS.

08:37.848 --> 08:39.624
IT'S SO BOHEMIAN.
AND CHARLIE'S GOING, RIGHT?

08:39.624 --> 08:42.983
YEAH, MEL,
DID YOUR IDIOT BROTHER
GET US TICKETS YET?

08:42.983 --> 08:45.696
‐ I DON'T THINK SHE CAN TALK.
‐ JUST NOD YOUR HEAD YES OR NO.

08:45.696 --> 08:47.632
IT'S RATED "R."
ARE THEY CHECKING I. D. s?

08:47.632 --> 08:51.532
IT'S A MOVIE INSIDE A TRUCK.
I THINK THEY'RE JUST
CHECKING PULSES.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.074
‐ I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GO.
‐ Sasha: I DO, I'M JUST SAYING

08:54.074 --> 08:55.657
I DON'T THINK WE NEED
AN ELABORATE PLAN OR DISGUISES.

08:55.657 --> 08:58.643
‐ CHARLIE'S FEET!
‐ OKAY, WE'RE GOING
TO NEED A LITTLE MORE.

08:58.643 --> 09:00.649
IT TASTES EXACTLY
LIKE CHARLIE'S FEET.

09:00.649 --> 09:03.652
OKAY, APPALACHIA,
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR
BROTHER'S FEET TASTE LIKE?

09:03.652 --> 09:05.654
STOP.
THAT'S RHETORICAL.

09:05.654 --> 09:08.509
I'M GOING HOME.

09:08.509 --> 09:10.260
7:00 SHARP.
DON'T BE LATE.

09:10.655 --> 09:12.883
IT'S NOT BAD.

09:21.642 --> 09:22.675
I'M NOT SCARED OF YOU.

09:25.526 --> 09:26.671
YOU SEE THIS?

09:26.671 --> 09:29.900
THAT'S A NOMI MALONE.
INTIMIDATING, RIGHT?

09:44.004 --> 09:46.086
MAKE IT RAIN!

09:56.887 --> 09:59.890
‐ AHHH.
‐ I'M SORRY, YOU LEAVE VEGAS

09:59.890 --> 10:02.563
‐ <i>THEN</i> WIND UP ON THE POLE?
‐ TALIA!

10:02.563 --> 10:05.025
TALIA, TALIA‐‐

10:05.025 --> 10:06.707
OH GOD, TALIA!

10:06.707 --> 10:09.690
‐ ( laughs ) HI!
‐ HI!

10:09.690 --> 10:11.992
HI!

10:11.992 --> 10:12.717
HI!
HOW'S BORIS?

10:12.717 --> 10:15.495
YOUR CAR? I THOUGHT
YOU NAMED IT KYLE.

10:15.495 --> 10:16.729
‐ NO, THAT WAS A BOYFRIEND.
‐ KYLE WASN'T A CAR?

10:16.729 --> 10:19.540
HE HAD MILES ON HIM,
BUT HE WAS HUMAN.

10:19.540 --> 10:22.663
WELL, BORIS IS FINE.
AND I COME BEARING
A SURPRISE GIFT.

10:22.663 --> 10:26.086
‐ YOUR LAST CHECK FROM THE SHOW.
‐ COOL! WOW.

10:26.086 --> 10:26.739
‐ WEIRD.
‐ WHY?

10:26.739 --> 10:30.671
IT'S MY LAST CHECK,
IT'S JUST‐‐ IT'S LIKE...
REALITY.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.594
I'M FINALLY REALIZING
NO MORE SPANGLES
IN MY BUTT CRACK.

10:33.594 --> 10:36.637
THAT PHRASE HAS NEVER BEEN
SAID SO WISTFULLY BEFORE,
LIKE EVER.

10:36.637 --> 10:39.099
‐ WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH IT?
HOARD IT? FRAME IT?
‐ BLOW IT?

10:39.099 --> 10:40.762
AND WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK WITH MORE
FROM "THE SUZE ORMAN SHOW."

10:40.762 --> 10:43.748
WE'RE SPENDING IT‐‐
EVERY CENT.
BIRTHDAY ROAD TRIP

10:43.748 --> 10:45.767
AND WE'LL COME BACK
WITH NOT EVEN A DIME LEFT.

10:45.767 --> 10:49.860
AND SINCE YOU'RE STRIPPING NOW
YOU'RE JUST ONE BACHELOR PARTY
AWAY FROM BEING SET.

10:49.860 --> 10:52.773
‐ ROAD TRIP, YEAH RIGHT.
‐ YEAH, RIGHT ON!

10:52.773 --> 10:54.615
YOU KNOW THE CRAZY LADY
I LIVE WITH?

10:54.615 --> 10:57.327
‐ YOUR MOTHER‐IN‐LAW?
‐ YEAH WELL, THE LOON
FROM LOONTOWN

10:57.327 --> 11:00.370
UP AND DISAPPEARED
THIS WEEKEND AND I HAVE
TO TEACH ALL HER CLASSES.

11:00.370 --> 11:03.163
‐ SO THAT'S WHAT THE POLE'S FOR?
‐ YEAH, HERE AT PARADISE
DANCE ACADEMY

11:03.163 --> 11:06.376
WE SPECIALIZE
IN GIRLS WITH DADDY ISSUES,
SO WE START 'EM YOUNG.

11:06.376 --> 11:08.879
‐ SO WE'RE NOT ROAD‐TRIPPING?
‐ MMM.

11:08.879 --> 11:10.881
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
ACCORDING TO LOONY,

11:10.881 --> 11:13.754
WE ARE AT THE AGE
BIRTHDAYS ANYMORE.

11:13.754 --> 11:15.385
‐ WE'RE DEAD?
‐ I GUESS.

11:15.385 --> 11:17.297
SCREW THAT.
WE WILL ALWAYS DO BIRTHDAYS.

11:17.297 --> 11:19.600
‐ WE'LL JUST BLOW IT OUT
HERE IN PARADISE.
‐ REALLY?

11:19.600 --> 11:22.182
ABSOLUTELY.
WE CAN LOOK HOT ANYWHERE.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.516
AND CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES
OF LOOKING AS HOT AS WE CAN LOOK
IN THIS PLACE.

11:25.516 --> 11:27.107
WE'LL KNOCK
THIS TOWN ON ITS ASS

11:27.107 --> 11:29.189
AND THEN KICK IT IN THE FACE
IF IT EVEN TRIES TO FIGHT BACK.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.361
‐ OH, I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
‐ AWWW.

11:31.361 --> 11:33.802
‐ I WANT TO SHOW YOU MY PLACE.
I HAVE CUSTOM‐MADE CURTAINS.
‐ GET OUT.

11:33.802 --> 11:35.808
‐ AND FRESH FRUIT IN MY FRIDGE.
‐ WHO ARE YOU?

11:46.496 --> 11:48.328
‐ HUH.
‐ PARADISE‐‐

11:48.328 --> 11:51.041
DON'T LET THE NAME
FOOL YOU‐‐ SERIOUSLY,
'CAUSE IT'S NOT.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.333
OKAY, SO IT'S QUIET.
QUIET IS NICE FOR A CHANGE.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.506
‐ SURE.
‐ WHAT'S THAT?

11:55.506 --> 11:58.178
‐ THAT IS THE SURF WAX STORE.
‐ WHAT DO THEY SELL?

11:58.178 --> 11:59.259
‐ SURF WAX.
‐ AND?

11:59.259 --> 12:00.300
‐ AND?
‐ SURF WAX.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.682
‐ SURF WAX.
‐ AND?

12:01.682 --> 12:03.473
SURF WAX.
I CAN KEEP THIS UP
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.146
‐ WEIRD.
‐ WHAT'S WEIRDER IS THAT IT
USED TO BE A FLIP‐FLOP STORE,

12:06.146 --> 12:07.608
‐ WHERE THEY SOLD FLIP‐FLOPS.
‐ AND?

12:07.608 --> 12:10.400
‐ REALLY?
‐ HEY, THIS LOOKS INTERESTING.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.312
‐ UH, TALIA?
‐ OH MY GOD!

12:12.312 --> 12:14.404
THESE CLOTHES ARE
SO CUTE. C'MON.

12:14.404 --> 12:16.446
LET'S START BLOWING
THAT PAYCHECK.

12:16.446 --> 12:18.358
WHOA, THERE, TEX.
WE CAN'T GO IN THERE.

12:18.358 --> 12:20.160
‐ WHY NOT?
‐ YOU KNOW HOW IN A FAIRY TALE

12:20.160 --> 12:23.163
THERE'S LIKE A BRIDGE
THAT LEADS TO A CASTLE WHERE
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS

12:23.163 --> 12:25.075
THAT'S LOCKED IN A TOWER,
BUT THERE'S A CRAZY
LITTLE TROLL

12:25.075 --> 12:27.327
THAT LIVES UNDER THE BRIDGE,
AND IN ORDER TO RESCUE
THE PRINCESS

12:27.327 --> 12:28.709
‐ YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE TROLL?
‐ YEAH.

12:28.709 --> 12:30.420
WELCOME TO SPARKLES.
WHERE THE MOTTO IS

12:30.420 --> 12:31.752
"IF YOU'RE A PRINCESS,
YOU'RE SCREWED."

12:31.752 --> 12:35.175
OH MY GOD, ARE THOSE
DUCKS ON A DRESS?

12:37.007 --> 12:40.010
OH, THESE ARE CLASSIC.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.764
MICHELLE, DO YOU SEE THESE?
WHO WOULD THINK TO MAKE
A DRESS LIKE THIS?

12:43.764 --> 12:46.226
‐ CAN I HELP YOU?
‐ ONCE UPON A TIME‐‐

12:46.226 --> 12:48.809
I WAS JUST LOVING
THE DUCK DRESS.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.602
OH, AND THIS.

12:51.602 --> 12:54.855
AND THIS AND‐‐ OH MY GOD.
MICHELLE, LOOK HOW CUTE!

12:54.855 --> 12:58.238
I MAKE EVERYTHING MYSELF
AND I CAN ALTER ANYTHING
THAT DOESN'T FIT FOR FREE.

12:58.238 --> 13:01.031
GOLD MINE.
THIS PLACE IS A GOLD MINE.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.903
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
IN HERE FOR A WHILE.

13:02.903 --> 13:04.665
‐ UH, I'VE BEEN BUSY‐‐ WHAT?
‐ <i>( shrieks )</i>

13:04.665 --> 13:06.957
THE PRICES!
HAVE YOU SEEN THE PRICES?
ARE THESE THE REAL PRICES?

13:06.957 --> 13:09.039
‐ YES.
‐ EVERYTHING.
WE'RE BUYING EVERYTHING.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.752
MICHELLE, START GRABBING STUFF.
WE HAVE A LOT OF TRYING ON
TO DO BEFORE TONIGHT.

13:11.752 --> 13:13.544
TONIGHT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT?

13:13.544 --> 13:15.375
‐ IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.
‐ OH.

13:16.677 --> 13:18.719
I WILL HAVE
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
THANK YOU, TRULY.

13:18.719 --> 13:21.261
‐ WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
‐ OH, WE'RE JUST GOING
TO GO OUT.

13:21.261 --> 13:23.383
‐ THAT SOUNDS FUN.
‐ IT'S NOT JUST FUN.

13:23.383 --> 13:25.265
THE WAY WE CELEBRATE,
IT'S EPIC.

13:25.265 --> 13:28.478
WE'RE VERY INTO BIRTHDAYS.
THIS PURSE? I'M GETTING TWO.

13:28.478 --> 13:30.390
WHAT'S WITH
THE DECAPITATED
BEAR HEAD?

13:30.390 --> 13:32.312
‐ I'M MAKING A COAT.
‐ YOU'RE KIDDING.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.524
NO. LOOK.

13:33.524 --> 13:36.436
THAT IS THE MOST DISTURBED THING
I THINK YOU'VE EVER DONE.

13:36.436 --> 13:38.438
‐ DOES IT COME IN MY SIZE?
‐ YOU WANT TO TRY IT ON?

13:38.438 --> 13:42.282
‐ YES.
‐ SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY TONIGHT?

13:42.282 --> 13:44.074
OH BOY.
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED
THAT OUT YET.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.446
‐ WE USUALLY JUST SEE
WHERE THE NIGHT TAKES US.
‐ ( gasps )

13:46.446 --> 13:49.449
REMEMBER THE TIME
WE GOT DRUNK AND SNUCK
ON STAGE WITH TOM JONES

13:49.449 --> 13:52.713
AND DANCED FOR 10 MINUTES
BEFORE HE NOTICED WE WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE?

13:52.713 --> 13:55.125
THREE QUARTERS OF "DELILAH"
AND HALF OF "WHAT'S NEW,
PUSSYCAT?"

13:55.125 --> 13:57.668
AND THEN THAT LADY THREW
THAT ROOM KEY AND IT
HIT YOU IN THE HEAD

13:57.668 --> 14:00.220
AND YOU HAD TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL AND GET
THREE STITCHES.

14:00.220 --> 14:03.594
BUT THE DOCTOR WAS
REALLY CUTE AND HE TOOK US
OUT TO DINNER AFTERWARDS.

14:03.594 --> 14:05.516
‐ DR. LOBSTER.
‐ DR. LOBSTER.

14:05.516 --> 14:08.468
‐ THAT HAD TO MAKE THE TOP‐FIVE
BIRTHDAY LIST, RIGHT?
‐ NUMBER FOUR.

14:08.468 --> 14:12.102
‐ REALLY, WHAT WAS FIVE?
‐ COMIC‐CON‐‐ PRINCESS LEIA
COSTUME CONTEST.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.974
‐ ONE‐TWO SWEEP.
‐ <i>RIGHT. NUMBER THREE?</i>

14:13.974 --> 14:18.188
‐ SNEAKING
ONTO THE PLANE WITH...
‐ BON JOVI!

14:18.188 --> 14:19.860
‐ RIGHT.
‐ SO SO RIGHT.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.822
‐ TWO?
‐ TWO WAS WHEN I KISSED
GEORGE CLOONEY.

14:21.822 --> 14:23.113
YOU KISSED GEORGE CLOONEY?

14:23.113 --> 14:24.324
‐ YEAH.
‐ <i>WHAT WAS IT LIKE?</i>

14:24.324 --> 14:26.577
‐ LIKE KISSING GEORGE CLOONEY.
‐ AND THAT WAS TWO?

14:26.577 --> 14:28.328
‐ KISSING GEORGE CLOONEY
WAS TWO.
‐ <i>YEP.</i>

14:28.328 --> 14:29.449
‐ <i>WHAT WAS ONE?
</i>‐ OH WELL, ONE...

14:29.449 --> 14:31.582
‐ WE NEVER TALK ABOUT ONE.
‐ NO, IT WAS SO MONUMENTAL...

14:31.582 --> 14:33.624
‐ THAT WE DON'T
WANT TO REPEAT IT.
‐ AND WE CAN'T REMEMBER IT.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.205
FOR MY LAST BIRTHDAY
FANNY TOOK ME

14:35.205 --> 14:37.628
TO COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG.
I GOT A BONNET.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.379
OH, THAT SOUNDS...

14:39.379 --> 14:42.673
‐ VAGUELY AMISH.
‐ I BET TONIGHT'S GOING
TO BE REALLY FUN.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.345
‐ MAKE SURE TO TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT.
‐ WHEN?

14:45.345 --> 14:47.678
‐ WHEN WE TALK.
‐ WHEN DO WE TALK?

14:47.678 --> 14:50.721
‐ WE'RE TALKING NOW.
‐ BUT THAT'S 'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE TROLL.

14:50.721 --> 14:53.433
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU'RE GOING OUT,

14:53.433 --> 14:57.227
THE TWO OF YOU,
IT'S NICE TO HAVE
ANOTHER PERSON ALONG

14:57.227 --> 14:59.520
TO KEEP AN EYE
ON YOUR BAG IF YOU
GET UP TO DANCE

14:59.520 --> 15:02.983
OR TO WATCH THE BATHROOM DOOR
IN CASE YOU NEED TO USE
THE MEN'S ROOM?

15:02.983 --> 15:05.696
‐ UH‐HUH?
‐ A THIRD PERSON
LIKE IN "CHARLIE'S ANGELS."

15:05.696 --> 15:09.079
‐ THERE WERE THREE OF THEM.
‐ YEAH, BUT ONLY TWO STAYED ON
THE SHOW FOR THE ENTIRE RUN

15:09.079 --> 15:11.582
‐ SO REALLY THERE WERE TWO.
‐ THERE WERE THREE
IN THE PICTURE.

15:11.582 --> 15:13.664
‐ BUT TWO IN LOYALTY AND SPIRIT.
‐ BUT THREE IN REALITY
AND NUMBER.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.536
‐ I WAS THINKING IF YOU
NEEDED A THIRD...
‐ WE DON'T.

15:15.536 --> 15:16.587
‐ ...I COULD COME ALONG...
‐ TWO IS FINE.

15:16.587 --> 15:17.958
...AND WATCH THE MEN'S
ROOM DOOR FOR YOU.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.209
‐ YOU DON'T WANT
TO COME WITH US.
‐ WHY NOT?

15:19.209 --> 15:20.460
‐ YEAH, WHY NOT?
‐ WOW,

15:20.460 --> 15:22.462
ARE WE SO
NOT COMMUNICATING TODAY.

15:22.462 --> 15:24.925
‐ YOU SAID I NEED TO GO OUT
WITH PEOPLE MY OWN AGE.
‐ YEAH, BUT NOT WITH ME.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.427
‐ YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
MY OWN AGE THAT I KNOW.
‐ BUT‐‐

15:27.427 --> 15:28.719
I'LL GIVE YOU 20% OFF
OF EVERYTHING.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.602
‐ AND SOME FREE MOOD RINGS.
‐ I LOVE MOOD RINGS.

15:31.602 --> 15:33.684
‐ COME ON, SHE'LL BE HANDY.
‐ HOW?

15:33.684 --> 15:37.147
LIKE IF A BUTTON FALLS OFF
OR A ZIPPER BREAKS,
I CAN FIX IT.

15:37.147 --> 15:39.650
YEAH, PLUS SHE'S CUTE.
LIKE A PURSE DOG.

15:39.650 --> 15:42.232
‐ IT'LL BE LIKE HAVING
A SHIH TZU.
‐ OH PLEASE?!

15:42.232 --> 15:44.194
( whispers )
PLEASE LET ME BE
YOUR SHIH TZU?

15:44.194 --> 15:46.987
OKAY, BUT IF SHE'S COMING,
WE HAVE TO CHANGE
THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.369
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT LET'S DO IT!

15:51.201 --> 15:53.534
‐ I SHOULD NOT HAVE
WORN THESE SHOES.
‐ THEY'RE CUTE.

15:53.534 --> 15:55.666
THEY'RE TIGHT AND THEY
MAKE ME WALK FUNNY.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.457
‐ THEY MAKE YOU WALK SEXY.
‐ REALLY?

15:57.457 --> 15:58.919
‐ IN A HANNA‐BARBERA
KIND OF WAY.
‐ HUH?

15:58.919 --> 16:00.631
YOU'LL BE DOING
A LOT OF SITTING.

16:00.631 --> 16:03.083
‐ Woman: <i>TELL ME
AGAIN THAT I'M CRAZY!
</i>‐ Man: <i>YOU'RE CRAZY!</i>

16:03.083 --> 16:05.756
‐ Woman: <i>WHEN I HAVE NOTHING
BUT PROOF ON MY SIDE?!
</i>‐ Man: <i>WHAT PROOF?</i>

16:05.756 --> 16:07.798
‐ WHAT DO WE DO?
‐ I GUESS WE KNOCK?

16:07.798 --> 16:09.850
‐ Man: <i>WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
</i>‐ Woman: <i>I CAN'T BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE FOR MY ACTIONS.</i>

16:09.850 --> 16:11.972
‐ <i>APPARENTLY I'M CRAZY! NO!
</i>‐ Man: <i>PUT THAT DOWN!</i>

16:11.972 --> 16:14.054
‐ <i>( ceramic shatters )
</i>‐ Man: <i>THAT'S JONATHAN ADLER,
YOU LUNATIC!</i>

16:14.054 --> 16:15.766
‐ YOU FIRST.
‐ I'M NOT GOING TO KNOCK.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.018
‐ WE CAN'T JUST STAND HERE.
‐ SHOULD WE GO?

16:18.018 --> 16:20.150
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
‐ I'M TEXTING SASHA.

16:20.150 --> 16:22.442
Woman:
<i>YOU COME OVER HERE
AND YOU SAY THAT TO MY FACE!</i>

16:22.442 --> 16:25.155
OH, I HOPE HE DOESN'T
COME OVER HERE AND SAY THAT
TO HER FACE.

16:25.155 --> 16:27.568
‐ <i>( door opens )
</i>‐ GET IN.

16:27.568 --> 16:30.741
MOVE QUICKLY UP THE STAIRS,
DO NOT SAY A WORD.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.993
‐ COME ON, BOO.
‐ Woman: <i>AND WHO,
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,</i>

16:32.993 --> 16:36.286
‐ <i>NEEDS THIS MANY
THROW PILLOWS?!
</i>‐ HI, MR. AND MRS. TORRES.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.039
‐ BOO!
‐ I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.424
‐ Boo: <i>OW.
</i>‐ Ginny: <i>SORRY.</i>

16:45.425 --> 16:46.717
‐ OW.
‐ SORRY.

16:46.717 --> 16:47.928
‐ SORRY.
‐ OW!

16:47.928 --> 16:49.179
‐ OW!
‐ SORRY.

16:49.179 --> 16:51.221
SHE'S GOING TO BE SORRY
FOR THE NEXT 40 PLUCKS.

16:51.221 --> 16:53.053
JUST ISSUE A BLANKET APOLOGY
AND MOVE ON.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.095
‐ <i>( yelling continues )
</i>‐ WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

16:55.095 --> 16:57.768
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE PLUCKING
YOUR EYEBROWS IF YOU CAN'T
TAKE THE PAIN.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.690
BECAUSE CHARLIE IS
GOING TO BE THERE TONIGHT

16:59.690 --> 17:02.022
AND GINNY'S GOING
TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE
DITA VON TEESE.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.023
‐ WAIT, I AM?
‐ AREN'T YOU?

17:03.023 --> 17:04.945
I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING
YOU LOOK LIKE KAT VON D.

17:04.945 --> 17:07.528
‐ I THOUGHT CHARLIE
LIKED DITA VON TEESE.
‐ WHO DOES CHARLIE LIKE?

17:07.528 --> 17:09.950
‐ NEO FROM THE MATRIX.
‐ OKAY, NEVER MIND.

17:09.950 --> 17:11.992
THEY'RE ALMOST
THE SAME PERSON.
I'LL DO A COMBO.

17:11.992 --> 17:14.494
‐ ALMOST DONE, NOW I JUST
NEED MY ACCENT COLOR.
‐ <i>( yelling continuing )</i>

17:14.494 --> 17:16.156
WHAT TIME IS IT?
WE NEED TO LEAVE.

17:16.156 --> 17:18.869
‐ MAYBE THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO GO OUT.
‐ OH, THEY'RE GOING OUT.

17:18.869 --> 17:21.291
THIS IS A WORK THING.
MY MOTHER NEVER MISSES
A WORK THING.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.834
SHE'D RATHER LET
HER ROOTS GROW OUT
THAN MISS A WORK THING.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.627
‐ MAYBE GOLD.
‐ MELANIE, PAINTING
YOUR PINKY ANOTHER COLOR

17:26.627 --> 17:29.510
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AN ACCENT.
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE YOU
RAN OUT OF POLISH.

17:29.510 --> 17:33.093
‐ I DIDN'T INVENT THE CONCEPT.
‐ EVEN WORSE‐‐ YOU'RE COPYING
SOMEONE ELSE'S MORONIC IDEA.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.095
WOW, PLEASANT PERSON,
PARTY OF ONE.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.977
Woman:
<i>SASHA! COME DOWN HERE PLEASE!</i>

17:36.977 --> 17:38.849
GREAT.

17:40.771 --> 17:43.103
I KNOW THEY FIGHT A LOT,
BUT THIS ONE SOUNDS BAD.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.445
‐ I WONDER IF IT'S ABOUT
THE TIMOTHY SITUATION.
‐ MUST BE.

17:45.445 --> 17:47.067
‐ WE DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT.
‐ WE KNOW.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.900
‐ EVERYONE KNOWS.
‐ SASHA'S DAD AND TIMOTHY MARSH
ARE BOYFRIENDS.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.071
‐ THEY'RE IN LOVE.
‐ FORBIDDEN LOVE.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.743
‐ FORBIDDEN BY WHO?
‐ SASHA'S MOM.

17:52.743 --> 17:54.955
‐ OH. YEAH WELL‐‐
‐ AND NOW TIMOTHY'S MOVING AWAY.

17:54.955 --> 17:57.247
‐ AND THEY'LL NEVER GET
TO REALLY BE TOG ETHER.
‐ SAD.

17:57.247 --> 17:58.909
‐ SO SO SAD.
‐ SHH!

17:58.909 --> 17:59.830
‐ IT'S QUIET.

17:59.830 --> 18:01.582
‐ <i>( knocks )
</i>‐ ( girls yell )

18:01.582 --> 18:03.664
‐ EVERYBODY DECENT?
‐ JOSH!

18:03.664 --> 18:06.086
‐ Boo: <i>YOU SCARED US
HALF TO DEATH.
</i>‐ I DID?

18:06.086 --> 18:08.168
‐ WE THOUGHT YOU WERE SASHA.
‐ WHY ARE YOU SCARED OF SASHA?

18:08.168 --> 18:10.470
BECAUSE SHE'S USING
HER PARENTS' CORPSES
AS A COUCH.

18:10.470 --> 18:12.673
<i>NO, SHE'S NOT.
I JUST SAW HER.
SHE'S HAVING A YOGURT.</i>

18:12.673 --> 18:14.715
‐ SHE LET ME IN.
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:14.715 --> 18:17.017
‐ I BROUGHT YOU GUYS
SOME OVERNIGHT KITS.
‐ JOSH.

18:17.017 --> 18:19.479
NOTHING BIG,
JUST SOME MUFFINS,
COOKIE DOUGH,

18:19.479 --> 18:22.312
PRE‐LOADED PEZ DISPENSERS,
SOME APPLES FOR BOO...

18:22.312 --> 18:25.315
‐ JOSH!
‐ TWO DECKS OF CARDS IF YOU
WANT TO PLAY SOME CANASTA,

18:25.315 --> 18:28.358
CUCUMBER EYE MASKS‐‐
POP THEM IN THE FREEZER
FOR A FEW MINUTES

18:28.358 --> 18:31.321
FOR THE BEST RESULTS‐‐
FUZZY SOCKS IN CASE
YOUR FEET GET COLD

18:31.321 --> 18:33.994
‐ AND A DVD OF "GREASE."
‐ WOW, YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
IN THE WORLD

18:33.994 --> 18:36.617
WHOSE BOYFRIEND
IS BASICALLY A GIRL.
I MEANT THAT IN A GOOD WAY.

18:36.617 --> 18:40.120
‐ I SURE HOPE SO.
‐ YOU HAVE THE BEST
BOYFRIEND EVER.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.083
‐ I DO, DON'T I?
‐ OH MY GOD, I LOVE
COOKIE DOUGH!

18:43.083 --> 18:45.335
‐ IT'S MY CRACK.
‐ YOU WANT TO STAY?

18:45.335 --> 18:48.048
NOPE, IT'S GIRLS' NIGHT OUT.
I AM GONNA EITHER GO HIT
A STRIP CLUB

18:48.048 --> 18:50.130
OR DO SOME TRIG HOMEWORK.
I'M STILL DEBATING.

18:50.130 --> 18:53.053
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO COME TO THE MOVIE WITH US?

18:53.053 --> 18:56.056
BAG.
OUT.

19:00.521 --> 19:02.893
‐ WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?
‐ <i>( crashes )</i>

19:04.685 --> 19:07.978
‐ MY MOTHER'S REDECORATING.
‐ WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BESIDES
NEW FURNITURE?

19:07.978 --> 19:10.861
‐ IT MEANS THE IDIOTS
ARE NOT GOING OUT.
‐ RATS!

19:10.861 --> 19:13.233
‐ WELL, AT LEAST WE HAVE SNACKS.
‐ AND FUZZY SOCKS.

19:13.233 --> 19:15.445
AND WE CAN
WATCH "GREASE"‐‐
SING‐ALONG.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.538
WHAT ARE WE,
"REVENGE OF THE NERDS"?

19:17.538 --> 19:19.449
‐ WE ARE GOING OUT.
‐ WHAT?

19:19.449 --> 19:21.992
‐ HOW?
‐ LOOK, ONCE MY MOTHER IS
DONE WRECKING THE JOINT,

19:21.992 --> 19:24.204
SHE'LL TAKE HER
HAPPY BYE‐BYE PILLS
AND GO LIE DOWN.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.376
AND THEN MY FATHER
WILL GO IN THE DEN,
PUT ON HIS HEADPHONES

19:26.376 --> 19:28.549
AND WATCH OLD PERFORMANCES
OF HIS COLLEGE IMPROV GROUP

19:28.549 --> 19:30.841
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW WE'RE GONE.

19:30.841 --> 19:33.173
‐ BUT‐‐
‐ NO BUTS! NOW PAINT IT
IF YOU'RE GONNA PAINT IT,

19:33.173 --> 19:36.216
PLUCK IT IF YOU'RE GONNA
PLUCK IT, BUT GET YOUR SHOES
AND BRING THE BAGS

19:36.216 --> 19:37.678
'CAUSE WE ARE GOING OUT!

19:40.601 --> 19:41.972
‐ COME ON, TRULY.
‐ <i>NO.</i>

19:41.972 --> 19:44.144
‐ JUST LET US SEE THE DRESS.
‐ <i>I CAN'T.</i>

19:44.144 --> 19:47.147
HONEY, YOU HAVE TO COME OUT
OF THE DRESSING ROOM IF YOU WANT
TO WATCH THE MEN'S ROOM FOR US.

19:47.147 --> 19:49.570
‐ <i>I FEEL LIKE A HOOKER.
</i>‐ THEN WE'VE DONE OUR JOB.

19:49.570 --> 19:52.192
TRULY!
HERE, BOY.

19:52.192 --> 19:56.316
I'LL GIVE YOU A TREAT.
I TOLD YOU WE HAD TO CHANGE
THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

19:56.316 --> 19:59.239
OKAY!
FINE, I'M COMING OUT.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.534
‐ WOW. YOU LOOK TOTALLY
DOABLE IN THAT.
‐ I DO?

20:03.534 --> 20:05.285
‐ YOU DO.
‐ YOU SURE?

20:05.285 --> 20:09.089
THIS ISN'T SOME
CRUEL HAZING RITUAL YOU'VE
CONCOCTED TO HUMILIATE ME?

20:09.089 --> 20:12.332
HOW DID WE NOT THINK
OF CONCOCTING A CRUEL
HAZING RITUAL TO HUMILIATE HER?

20:12.332 --> 20:13.884
‐ WE ARE SO OFF OUR GAME.
‐ YOU LOOK GREAT.

20:13.884 --> 20:15.676
I DO?
MICHELLE?

20:15.676 --> 20:18.839
ANGELS,

20:18.839 --> 20:22.723
THE MISSION TONIGHT
IS TO GO OUT THERE
AND ROCK THE CASBAH!

20:22.723 --> 20:24.264
‐ WHOO!
‐ Both: WHOO!

20:24.264 --> 20:26.056
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
"ROCK THE CASBAH" MEANS.

20:26.056 --> 20:27.608
STICK WITH THE "WHOO"
INSTINCT, TRULY.

20:27.608 --> 20:29.479
‐ YOUR FIRST IMPULSE
WAS RIGHT ON THAT.
‐ OKAY.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.522
‐ WHOO!
‐ All: <i>WHOO!</i>

20:34.905 --> 20:37.618
( chattering,
bells ringing )

20:37.618 --> 20:39.409
‐ BOO!
‐ SORRY.

20:39.409 --> 20:41.572
DID I SCREW UP
MY EYEBROWS?

20:41.572 --> 20:44.705
NO. I THINK YOU
LOOK LIKE KAT VON D.
OR DITA VON TEESE.

20:44.705 --> 20:47.327
I THINK I LOOK LIKE ME
WITH UNEVEN EYEBROWS.

20:47.327 --> 20:50.040
DON'T WORRY, BOO.
I'M SURE CHARLIE,
LIKE EVERY GUY IN AMERICA,

20:50.040 --> 20:52.042
HAS VERY STRONG
EYEBROW‐TWEEZING OPINIONS.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.505
I BET HE MAKES ALL
HIS DECISIONS BASED
ON THE TWEEZE.

20:54.505 --> 20:57.087
‐ SO ARE MINE OKAY?
‐ SURE.

20:57.087 --> 21:00.841
GREAT, THE PRINCESS
AND ALL HER LITTLE PRINCESS
FRIENDS ARE HERE.

21:00.841 --> 21:03.473
‐ WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
‐ WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS.

21:03.473 --> 21:06.386
REALLY? FOR HOURS?
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT HERE
FOR HOW MANY HOURS?

21:06.386 --> 21:08.649
‐ ENOUGH HOURS.
‐ YOU WERE AT THE HOUSE
LIKE 10 SECONDS AGO.

21:08.649 --> 21:10.561
AND THEN I CAME HERE
AND GOT YOUR TICKETS

21:10.561 --> 21:13.393
AND THEN WAITED FOR YOU
WITH YOUR TICKETS LIKE I
TOLD YOU I WAS GOING TO DO.

21:13.393 --> 21:16.316
‐ SO HAND 'EM OVER
AND STOP BITCHING.
‐ HERE, NOW GO AWAY.

21:16.316 --> 21:19.239
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT
I DON'T KNOW YOU AND YOU
DON'T KNOW ME.

21:19.239 --> 21:21.451
WE LOOK IDENTICAL,
MORON!

21:23.664 --> 21:25.786
‐ BOO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
‐ BEING INVISIBLE.

21:25.786 --> 21:28.999
‐ IT'S WHAT I DO BEST.
‐ CAN WE JUST GO INSIDE?

21:37.758 --> 21:41.552
YOU OFFICIALLY SUCK!
THE PLACE IS FULL,

21:41.552 --> 21:44.845
WE ALMOST DIDN'T FIND SEATS
AND THE SEATS WE DO HAVE
AREN'T TOGETHER.

21:44.845 --> 21:48.478
I'M NEVER DOING ANYTHING FOR YOU
OR YOUR FRIENDS EVER AGAIN!

21:48.478 --> 21:49.770
I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME.

21:51.431 --> 21:53.854
SOMEDAY, BOO,
SOMEDAY YOU WILL TELL ME
WHAT EXACTLY YOU LIKE

21:53.854 --> 21:56.236
ABOUT MY BROTHER.
BECAUSE SERIOUSLY,
I DON'T GET IT.

21:56.236 --> 21:58.028
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GET IT.
THAT WOULD BE GROSS.

21:58.028 --> 22:00.240
HE'S RIGHT.
NO SEATS TOGETHER.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.653
AND I'LL PROBABLY END UP SITTING
NEXT TO SOME LOSER

22:02.653 --> 22:05.706
WHO'S BEEN
LIFTING THINGS ALL DAY
AND DIDN'T BOTHER TO SHOWER.

22:05.706 --> 22:07.788
OH MY GOD,
DEBBIE DOWNER, RELAX.

22:07.788 --> 22:09.369
‐ WE'LL GET FOUR SEATS
TOGETHER.
‐ HOW?

22:09.369 --> 22:12.292
CHILDREN.
GINNY, SEE THAT SEAT UP THERE
NEXT TO THE OLD GUY?

22:12.292 --> 22:14.084
‐ <i>YEAH?
</i>‐ <i>GO UP THERE
AND GET HIM TO MOVE.</i>

22:14.084 --> 22:16.917
‐ <i>HOW?
</i>‐ HE'S OLD. YOU CAN PROBABLY
JUST MAKE WATER SOUNDS

22:16.917 --> 22:19.960
AND HE'LL HAVE TO RUN
FOR THE BATHROOM. MEL,
YOU GO UP FRONT AND BE TALL.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.552
GOT IT, BE TALL.
AND THEN?

22:21.552 --> 22:24.054
BE TALL IN FRONT OF PEOPLE
AND THEY WILL SWITCH WITH YOU

22:24.054 --> 22:25.926
‐ AND YOU'LL END UP
WITH GINNY.
‐ BRILLIANT.

22:25.926 --> 22:27.638
<i>I'LL GO IN THE BACK
AND WORK MY WAY FORWARD.</i>

22:27.638 --> 22:29.970
<i>BOO, OVER THERE.
WORK YOUR WAY IN.
GOT IT?</i>

22:29.970 --> 22:31.932
FAN OUT AND WE'LL
MEET IN THE MIDDLE.

22:34.735 --> 22:36.897
Boo:
SORRY SORRY.

22:43.824 --> 22:46.246
I COULD REALLY
REALLY USE SOME POPCORN.

22:46.246 --> 22:49.580
YEAH, POPCORN.
POPCORN IS AWESOME.
I'M ON IT.

22:55.956 --> 22:57.337
HI THERE.

23:05.465 --> 23:07.888
I KNOW, I'M TALL.
GENES, RIGHT?

23:07.888 --> 23:10.310
THE INHERITED ONES,
NOT THE LOWRISE KIND.

23:10.310 --> 23:12.012
WE COULD SWITCH.
I DON'T MIND.

23:14.975 --> 23:18.018
HI. I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WOULD...

23:18.018 --> 23:20.521
‐ WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR EYEBROWS?
‐ ...SWITCH WITH ME?

23:20.521 --> 23:22.823
NOPE.
( spits )

23:22.823 --> 23:24.945
YEAH, I THINK
IT'S ABOUT VAMPIRES.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.698
THEY BATTLE FLESH‐EATING
ZOMBIES‐‐ VERY SCARY.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.661
ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN
AND, WELL, ANYONE
WITH A BAD TICKER.

23:30.661 --> 23:33.744
‐ A BAD WHAT?
‐ TICKER‐‐ ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU CALL IT?

23:35.165 --> 23:37.878
HEY, I COULD REALLY
USE A SODA.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.882
NOT INTO OLDER WOMEN, HUH?

23:49.890 --> 23:52.893
‐ WHY ARE YOU HOLDING
A FREAKIN' BABY?
‐ DON'T ASK.

23:52.893 --> 23:55.816
‐ <i>BUT HOW‐‐
</i>‐ MY LAST PLAN TO SWITCH SEATS
BACKFIRED, OKAY?

23:55.816 --> 23:56.857
I SAID DON'T ASK.

23:58.318 --> 24:01.191
‐ 60? 61?
‐ <i>NO.</i>

24:01.191 --> 24:03.153
NO NO.

24:03.153 --> 24:05.235
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
GUESS HOW OLD YOU ARE.

24:05.235 --> 24:08.028
HEY, I REALLY COULD
USE SOME NACHOS.

24:08.028 --> 24:11.241
‐ SO GO GET SOME.
‐ RATS.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.953
I'M GONE FOR TWO SECONDS

24:12.953 --> 24:15.245
AND YOU'RE HITTING
ON ANOTHER GIRL?

24:15.245 --> 24:17.337
‐ I'M GOING HOME.
‐ WAIT!

24:17.337 --> 24:19.840
‐ AT THE BUZZER. MEL!
‐ <i>I WASN'T TALKING TO HER.</i>

24:19.840 --> 24:21.882
‐ <i>LIAR!
</i>‐ WHERE'S BOO?

24:21.882 --> 24:24.545
‐ SHE HASN'T MOVED.
‐ <i>SHE'S PUTTING DOWN ROOTS.</i>

24:24.545 --> 24:27.848
RAISING A FAMILY.

24:27.848 --> 24:30.931
‐ WE GOTTA GET RID OF THIS GUY.
‐ HE'S NOT BUDGING FOR ANYTHING.

24:30.931 --> 24:33.433
‐ WE'RE SO CLOSE.
‐ WAIT, LET ME TRY SOMETHING.

24:33.433 --> 24:36.226
EXCUSE ME,
COULD WE HAVE YOUR SEAT

24:36.226 --> 24:38.769
‐ SO WE CAN ALL SIT TOGETHER?
‐ WELL, SURE.

24:39.980 --> 24:43.984
‐ I DID NOT THINK OF THAT.
‐ I'LL TEXT BOO.

24:49.409 --> 24:51.371
CHARLIE! DUDE!

24:51.371 --> 24:52.703
A SEAT!

24:52.703 --> 24:55.375
OH, UM, I'LL TALK
TO YOU AFTER, RIGHT?

24:55.375 --> 24:57.037
SURE.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.959
‐ NO WAY.
‐ WOW.

24:58.959 --> 25:03.083
‐ WHAT DO I DO?
‐ STAY THERE.

25:03.083 --> 25:05.005
WAIT, IS SHE STILL
HOLDING A BABY?

25:05.005 --> 25:06.967
SOMEHOW THAT DOESN'T
SURPRISE ME AT ALL.

25:06.967 --> 25:09.550
‐ ( gasps ) OH MY GOD.
‐ HEY BOO.

25:09.550 --> 25:12.092
UH, HEY HI.
WHAT'S UP?

25:12.092 --> 25:15.265
‐ IS THAT A BABY?
‐ NO.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.938
( cooing )

25:23.103 --> 25:25.315
OKAY, PEOPLE,
WHO'S MISSING A BABY?

25:27.738 --> 25:29.700
‐ WANT SOME?
‐ OKAY.

25:32.452 --> 25:34.575
HOW IS EVERYTHING
IN THIS TOWN CLOSED
BY 6:00?

25:34.575 --> 25:36.416
BRANSON IS OPEN LATER‐‐
BRANSON. MY GOD,

25:36.416 --> 25:38.999
EVEN THE OSMONDS' DINNER SHOW
DOESN'T START UNTIL 7:00.

25:38.999 --> 25:40.500
I'VE GOTTA TAKE
THESE SHOES OFF.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.162
NO NO NO.
PARTY RULE NUMBER ONE:

25:42.162 --> 25:44.164
NEVER TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF
UNTIL THE END OF THE NIGHT.

25:44.164 --> 25:46.166
YOUR FEET WILL SWELL
AND YOU'LL NEVER GET THEM
BACK ON AGAIN.

25:46.166 --> 25:48.258
THEN YOU'RE THE LOSER
CARRYING HER SHOES AROUND.

25:48.258 --> 25:50.170
‐ HERE'S THE MOVIE TRUCK.
‐ YAY, ACTIVITY.

25:50.170 --> 25:52.342
‐ Michelle: <i>ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
</i>‐ UNBELIEVABLE.

25:52.342 --> 25:55.175
‐ <i>PLUS TICKET DUDE'S A LADY.
</i>‐ CAN'T EVEN SEDUCE OUR WAY IN.

25:55.175 --> 25:57.938
‐ JUST OUR LUCK.
‐ WE COULD BRIBE HER.

25:57.938 --> 25:59.600
‐ WITH WHAT MONEY?
‐ WITH THE MONEY

25:59.600 --> 26:02.603
YOU WERE GONNA USE FOR MY
FABULOUS BIRTHDAY DINNER.
AND THERE'S MY CHECK.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.314
‐ IT'S GONE.
‐ TALIA.

26:04.314 --> 26:06.446
‐ WE SPENT IT AT SPARKLES.
‐ WHAT DID WE BUY?

26:06.446 --> 26:08.779
MY OUTFIT, YOUR OUTFIT,
TRULY'S OUTFIT.

26:08.779 --> 26:11.031
‐ TRULY OWNS THE STORE!
‐ IT WAS A GIFT.

26:11.031 --> 26:13.073
IT'S NOT A GIFT UNLESS
YOU BUY IT FOR THE PERSON.

26:13.073 --> 26:15.906
SO YOU'RE BUYING GIFTS
FOR TRULY FROM HER OWN STORE,

26:15.906 --> 26:17.457
BUT YOU'RE NOT
BUYING ME DINNER?

26:17.457 --> 26:20.080
SHE'S STANDING RIGHT THERE
AND YOU'RE MAKING HER FEEL BAD.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.333
‐ AND LOOK HOW CUTE SHE LOOKS.
‐ OKAY FINE. SORRY, TRULY.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.756
‐ ENJOY IT.
‐ THERE'S A BACK.

26:25.756 --> 26:28.549
‐ WAIT, TRULY, WHAT?
‐ THERE'S A BACK DOOR
AND IT'S PROPPED OPEN.

26:28.549 --> 26:32.342
‐ <i>WE COULD JUST SNEAK IN.
</i>‐ LOOK AT YOU,

26:32.342 --> 26:35.556
ACTING ALL GROWN UP
AND FIGURING OUT HOW
TO SNEAK IN PLACES,

26:35.556 --> 26:39.349
WEARING SHORT DRESSES
AND ACTING AGE‐APPROPRIATE.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

26:43.604 --> 26:47.147
‐ <i>( screams, chainsaw roaring )
</i>‐I LOOK AWAY FOR ONE SECOND

26:47.147 --> 26:50.070
‐ AND HE'S GOT A PILE OF SALAMI.
‐ NO, THE GUY WITH NO ARMS

26:50.070 --> 26:52.993
HAD ARMS A MINUTE AGO.
THEY'RE ON THE SIDE THERE, SEE?

26:52.993 --> 26:56.446
THE EFFECTS AREN'T SUPER GREAT,
SO IT KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE SALAMIS.

26:56.446 --> 26:59.289
‐ IF I HAD A NICKEL
FOR EVERY ARM‐‐
‐ ( laughs )

26:59.289 --> 27:03.123
‐ YOU'RE FUNNY.
‐ <i>( screaming,
maniacal laughter )</i>

27:05.586 --> 27:08.048
<i>( chainsaw roaring )</i>

27:08.048 --> 27:09.670
( sighs )

27:09.670 --> 27:12.963
‐ WE'RE LEANING AGAINST A WALL.
‐ IT'S COOL.

27:12.963 --> 27:15.215
‐ YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING.
‐ IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

27:15.215 --> 27:18.258
‐ SINCE I'VE STOOD IN BACK
AND WATCHED A MOVIE.
‐ WAIT.

27:21.562 --> 27:23.724
TRULY FRANCES
ABIGAIL DOMINICA III,

27:23.724 --> 27:25.816
DID YOU SNEAK BOOZE
INTO THIS MOVIE TRUCK?

27:25.816 --> 27:28.228
I STOLE IT FROM SAM'S DESK
AT SPARKLES.

27:28.228 --> 27:30.110
I WORSHIP YOU.

27:32.653 --> 27:34.404
‐ WOO!
‐ WOO!

27:34.404 --> 27:37.197
‐ Crowd: SHHH!
‐ ( softly ) WOO.

27:37.197 --> 27:41.081
‐ HEY, WHAT IS THIS CALLED?
‐ "MOUNTAIN OF ARMS."

27:41.081 --> 27:44.244
"MOUNTAIN OF ARMS"?
AS IN SOMEONE BUILDS A...

27:44.244 --> 27:47.047
‐ <i>( chainsaw roars )
</i>‐ ...MOUNTAIN OF ARMS.

27:52.793 --> 27:54.595
‐ WE GOTTA GO.
‐ WHAT?

27:54.595 --> 27:56.757
IT'S 11:40.
MY HOUSE ALARM
SETS AT MIDNIGHT

27:56.757 --> 27:58.599
AND IT DOESN'T GO
BACK OFF UNTIL 6:00 A. M.

27:58.599 --> 27:59.930
‐ WE NEED TO GET BOO.
‐ I'LL DO IT.

28:02.142 --> 28:04.184
‐ WHAT?
‐ MICHELLE IS HERE.

28:06.106 --> 28:07.568
( crowd groans )

28:07.568 --> 28:10.811
OH MY GOD,
IT'S ANOTHER ARM.

28:10.811 --> 28:13.814
IT'S LIKE ED WOOD!
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE LITERALLY
WENT TO A WAREHOUSE

28:13.814 --> 28:16.777
‐ LOOKED AROUND, SAW 50,000 ARMS
AND THOUGHT, "DONE"!
‐ TANK TOP!

28:16.777 --> 28:19.489
‐ DRINK.
‐ HEY, WE SHOULD
MAKE A MOVIE.

28:19.489 --> 28:22.823
"SKYSCRAPER OF TEETH"!
"ZIGGURAT OF LEGS"!

28:22.823 --> 28:25.375
‐ "THE TOWER OF TORSOS."
‐ YES! "TOWER OF TORSOS"!

28:25.375 --> 28:27.167
HEY, TALIA WAS
IN A MOVIE CALLED THAT.

28:27.167 --> 28:28.959
IT WAS CALLED
"BLOOD DUNGEON TWO."

28:28.959 --> 28:30.961
SAME THING.
AND SHE TOOK HER TOP OFF.

28:30.961 --> 28:33.253
‐ REALLY?
‐ WHICH IS WHY I WAS KILLED
IN THE FIRST SCENE.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.546
‐ FIRST BOOBS EQUALS FIRST KILL.
‐ WHAT KILLED YOU?

28:35.546 --> 28:37.838
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE
KNEW EXACTLY,

28:37.838 --> 28:40.260
BUT IT WAS LARGE,
IT GLOWED

28:40.260 --> 28:42.342
AND I SLEPT WITH IT
AFTER WE WRAPPED.

28:42.342 --> 28:43.934
( chuckles )

28:43.934 --> 28:45.936
‐ SHE'LL TELL MADAME FANNY.
‐ MAYBE SHE WON'T.

28:45.936 --> 28:48.559
‐ WE COULD SNEAK PAST HER.
‐ SHE'S 18 FEET TALL,
SHE'S TOTALLY GOING TO SEE US.

28:48.559 --> 28:50.981
‐ WELL, IS SHE A NARC?
‐ SHE DOESN'T LOOK NARC‐Y TO ME.

28:50.981 --> 28:53.483
SHE COULD BE A COVERT NARC,
LIKE SHE ACTS LIKE
SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,

28:53.483 --> 28:54.945
YOU HANG OUT
AND DO NARC‐ABLE
THINGS WITH THEM,

28:54.945 --> 28:56.857
AND THEN YOU GO HOME
AND YOU'VE BEEN
TOTALLY NARCED.

28:56.857 --> 28:59.319
‐ SO WHAT DO WE DO?
‐ WE WAIT FOR THE MOVIE
TO BE OVER AND THEY LEAVE,

28:59.319 --> 29:01.782
‐ THEN WE RUN BACK TO MY HOUSE.
‐ <i>( chainsaw rumbles )</i>

29:01.782 --> 29:03.704
‐ I THINK HIS CHAINSAW DIED.
‐ EXCELLENT.

29:08.078 --> 29:11.001
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY POETIC
HOW THE KILLER CUT OFF

29:11.001 --> 29:12.963
HIS OWN ARMS TO FINISH
THE MOUNTAIN,

29:12.963 --> 29:15.756
‐ BUT THEN THERE WAS NO WAY
OF GETTING THEM TO THE TOP.
‐ ( laughs )

29:19.049 --> 29:21.802
OKAY, SOMEONE GET BOO
SO WE CAN GO.

29:28.438 --> 29:30.440
‐ FOUND HER.
‐ EXCELLENT.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.274
‐ WAIT!
‐ Michelle: <i>BOO!</i>

29:34.274 --> 29:36.987
"MOUNTAIN OF ARMS"!
OH MY GOD, RIGHT?

29:36.987 --> 29:39.820
"MOUNTAIN OF ARMS"!
OH MY GOD.

29:43.113 --> 29:46.166
‐ ( whispering ) DID SHE SEE US?
‐ I DON'T THINK SHE
SAW ANYTHING.

29:46.166 --> 29:48.709
‐ WE HAVE TO LEAVE.
‐ I HAVE TO THANK CHARLIE
FOR THE TICKETS.

29:48.709 --> 29:50.330
‐ BOO.
‐ CHARLIE!

29:53.504 --> 29:56.376
‐ HEY.
‐ SHE'S TRYING TO KILL ME.

29:56.376 --> 29:58.298
11:55, HOW FAST
CAN WE ALL RUN?

29:58.298 --> 30:00.010
THAT'S IT,
I'M GETTING HER.

30:00.010 --> 30:03.554
‐ HEY.
‐ OH, HEY, BOO!

30:03.554 --> 30:06.927
‐ HI, I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU FOR THE‐‐
‐ OH, GIMME YOUR HAND.

30:06.927 --> 30:10.060
MY PHONE DIED
AND MY HANDS ARE GREASY

30:10.060 --> 30:11.852
‐ FROM THE POPCORN.
‐ OH.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.274
‐ TEXT ME THAT
WHEN YOU GET HOME, OKAY?
‐ OKAY.

30:16.316 --> 30:18.779
‐ COME ON!
‐ I CAN'T LOOK.
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

30:18.779 --> 30:21.071
‐ "SHARI"
AND THEN SHARI'S NUMBER.
‐ WHO'S SHARI?

30:21.071 --> 30:24.154
‐ THAT'S SHARI.
‐ Ginny: THAT'S TOTALLY WHAT
DITA VON TEESE LOOKS LIKE.

30:24.154 --> 30:26.116
WE DEFINITELY DIDN'T GET
THAT RIGHT, BOO. SORRY.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.328
YEAH, IT'S A REAL TRAGEDY.
LET'S MOVE!

30:29.790 --> 30:31.912
Truly:
WAIT, WHERE ARE WE?

30:31.912 --> 30:34.715
Talia:
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHERE DID WE PARK?

30:34.715 --> 30:37.087
WE PARKED NEAR A TREE
THAT LOOKS LIKE A HOBBIT.

30:37.087 --> 30:39.800
ALL THE TREES HERE
LOOK LIKE HOBBITS.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.962
I LIKE THAT WORD "HOBBIT."
HOBBIT.

30:41.962 --> 30:44.094
IT HAS A NICE
IN‐MY‐MOUTH‐FEEL

30:44.094 --> 30:46.557
WHEN I SAY IT‐‐ H‐HOBBIT.

30:46.557 --> 30:49.229
OH, THERE'S MY CAR!

30:55.275 --> 30:58.028
I'M THINKING
WE SHOULD WALK HOME.

30:58.028 --> 31:01.652
‐ OR SLEEP HERE.
‐ YES, SLEEP IS GENIUS.

31:01.652 --> 31:04.114
I COULD TAKE OFF MY SHOES
AND START SLEEPING.

31:04.114 --> 31:06.947
NO! YOU SAID WE WOULD
STAY UP ALL NIGHT AND IT
HASN'T BEEN ALL NIGHT,

31:06.947 --> 31:08.909
‐ SO YOU CAN'T TAKE
YOUR SHOES OFF.
‐ BUT I WANNA.

31:08.909 --> 31:11.491
‐ ME TOO.
‐ CUPCAKE A. T. M.!

31:11.491 --> 31:14.915
‐ TRULY?
‐ DID YOU SAY
"CUPCAKE A. T. M."?

31:14.915 --> 31:17.958
I READ ABOUT IT.
IN LOS ANGELES THERE
IS A PINK A. T. M.

31:17.958 --> 31:20.921
AND IT DISPENSES ALL KINDS
OF CUPCAKES 24 HOURS A DAY.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.053
‐ ( squeaks )
‐ WHO IS SHE?

31:23.053 --> 31:25.556
I HAVE NO IDEA,
BUT I LIKE HER.

31:25.556 --> 31:29.600
PROBLEM IS WE MADE
MR. TOM COLLINS GO BYE‐BYE,
ALL EMPTY.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.602
AND I MAY HAVE DRUNK
ALL THE BITTERS.

31:31.602 --> 31:33.564
‐ I'M SOBER.
‐ UNPOSSIBLE.

31:33.564 --> 31:35.315
YOU MATCHED US
DRINK FOR DRINK.

31:35.315 --> 31:37.187
YES, AND THEN I SPIT IT
BACK IN THE BOTTLE.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.940
‐ OH MY GOD!
‐ I'M NOT A DRINKER.

31:39.940 --> 31:42.693
‐ BACK IN THE BOTTLE?!
‐ SERIOUSLY, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.404
BUT IT'S A GOOD THING
'CAUSE I CAN DRIVE,

31:44.404 --> 31:46.156
SO WE CAN GO GET
A. T. M. CUPCAKES, RIGHT?

31:46.156 --> 31:48.158
BACK IN THE BOTTLE?

31:48.158 --> 31:49.790
( groans )

31:52.452 --> 31:54.414
UHH YEAH HA.

31:54.414 --> 31:56.166
OKAY.

31:57.998 --> 32:00.380
‐ CUPCAKES!
‐ WHOO‐HOO!

32:01.672 --> 32:04.304
Boo:
IT'S 12:15‐‐ NO, 12:16.

32:04.304 --> 32:06.967
‐ Sasha: IT IS?
‐ YES, I'VE BEEN
YELLING THAT AT YOU

32:06.967 --> 32:09.930
‐ FOR THE PAST THREE BLOCKS.
‐ I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING
"RUN FASTER."

32:09.930 --> 32:12.102
"12:15" DOESN'T SOUND
ANYTHING LIKE RUN FASTER.

32:12.102 --> 32:13.894
‐ IT'S BLINKING RED.
‐ DAMN IT!

32:13.894 --> 32:16.056
‐ CAN WE TURN THE ALARM OFF?
‐ FROM THE INSIDE.

32:16.056 --> 32:18.188
‐ LET'S DO THAT.
‐ YEAH, MEL, LET'S DO THAT.

32:18.188 --> 32:20.270
EVERYONE THINK REAL HARD
AND USE ALL YOUR
PSYCHIC POWERS

32:20.270 --> 32:22.192
TO TURN THE ALARM OFF.
ARE YOU DOING IT?

32:22.192 --> 32:24.985
OKAY? IS IT WORKING?
NO? REALLY? SHOCKING.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.528
‐ SORRY.
‐ I KNEW WE'D GET CAUGHT
IF WE SNUCK OUT.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.740
JUST LEMME
FIGURE THIS OUT.

32:32.953 --> 32:34.875
<i>OVER HERE!</i>

32:38.168 --> 32:40.040
‐ THERE.
‐ YES?

32:40.040 --> 32:42.252
‐ WE'LL GET UP THERE
AND CLIMB IN.
‐ OH OKAY,

32:42.252 --> 32:45.045
‐ LEMME GET MY CATAPULT.
‐ IF THERE WAS A TREE
TO CLIMB MAYBE.

32:45.045 --> 32:48.088
OR A MOUNTAIN OF ARMS.
WE CAN MAKE A MOUNTAIN
OF ARMS AND CLIMB UP THAT.

32:48.088 --> 32:50.260
THE CAR, YOU IDIOTS.
WE'LL CLIMB UP THE CAR.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.352
‐ THAT'S NEVER GOING TO WORK.
‐ BOO, BOO.

32:52.352 --> 32:53.684
OKAY.

33:00.230 --> 33:02.903
‐ C'MON,
‐ YEAH, TALK TO THE WINDOW,
THAT WILL HELP.

33:02.903 --> 33:05.566
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M TRYING TO SAVE US ALL
FROM LECTURES AND GROUNDINGS,

33:05.566 --> 33:07.157
SO YOU CAN EITHER
HELP OR SHUT IT!

33:11.281 --> 33:14.244
‐ DID YOU GROW
IN THE LAST 10 SECONDS?
‐ NO, I'M GONNA JUMP.

33:14.244 --> 33:17.497
OH OKAY, THIS I'M GONNA
WANNA GET ON VIDEO.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.253
‐ ( crashes )
‐ OH MY GOD!

33:23.253 --> 33:25.045
DON'T WAKE MY PARENTS UP!

33:29.219 --> 33:33.013
‐ I HAD AN IDEA.
‐ YOU DID.

33:33.013 --> 33:36.226
‐ NONE OF YOU HAD IDEAS.
‐ THIS IS TRUE.

33:36.226 --> 33:38.599
‐ I COULD‐‐
‐ <i>( laughter continues )</i>

33:41.441 --> 33:43.233
ALL RIGHTY THEN.

33:48.739 --> 33:52.202
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
JAMES BOND MOVIE WHERE THEY
SPRAY‐PAINTED THAT GIRL GOLD

33:52.202 --> 33:55.285
AND THEN SHE SUFFOCATED 'CAUSE
ALL HER PORES WERE CLOGGED?

33:55.285 --> 33:58.709
‐ YES.
‐ THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN
TO ME, BUT IN REVERSE.

33:58.709 --> 34:01.211
FROSTING IS GOING
TO CLOG MY PORES

34:01.211 --> 34:04.044
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
I WILL STOP BREATHING

34:04.044 --> 34:06.466
AND COLORED SPRINKLES
WILL SHOOT OUT MY NOSE.

34:06.466 --> 34:08.378
‐ HOW MANY DID YOU EAT?
‐ OH MY GOD.

34:08.378 --> 34:11.301
‐ THIS MANY.
‐ THIS MANY.

34:11.301 --> 34:14.014
‐ OHHH.
‐ YOU COULD ALWAYS
OUT‐EAT ME.

34:14.014 --> 34:17.808
‐ YOU COULD ALWAYS OUT‐DANCE ME.
‐ YEAH WELL, THAT WAS THEN.

34:17.808 --> 34:20.020
ARMS.

34:20.020 --> 34:24.064
‐ FROSTED ARMS.
‐ OH GOD, PLEASE TELL ME
SHE REMEMBERS HER DREAMS.

34:24.064 --> 34:27.187
LOOK, SHE KEPT HER HEELS
ON THE WHOLE NIGHT.

34:27.187 --> 34:31.361
‐ THE STUDENT
SURPASSES THE TEACHER.
‐ SO ON THE BIRTHDAY SCALE?

34:31.361 --> 34:33.864
THIS ONE DEFINITELY
CRACKED THE TOP 10.

34:33.864 --> 34:37.367
‐ REALLY? WOW.
‐ NOT THE TOP FIVE,

34:37.367 --> 34:39.249
BUT I THINK IT
KNOCKED OUT THE TIME

34:39.249 --> 34:41.001
THAT WE BROKE
INTO THAT TEMPLE

34:41.001 --> 34:43.043
AND SKINNY‐DIPPED
IN THE MITZVAH BATHS.

34:43.043 --> 34:45.255
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL
GETTING OLDER?

34:45.255 --> 34:47.467
FANTASTIC.

34:47.467 --> 34:50.170
I LIKE GETTING OLDER.
SOME WOMEN SAY THEY DON'T,

34:50.170 --> 34:53.423
BUT ME, I FEEL LIKE
EVERY TIME A PART OF ME SAGS

34:53.423 --> 34:55.766
LOWER TO THE GROUND,
AN ANGEL GETS ITS WINGS.

34:55.766 --> 34:59.309
‐ IT'S NICE YOU'RE STILL DRUNK.
‐ I THINK IT'S THE BITTERS.

34:59.309 --> 35:01.932
‐ OH, LAST ONE.
‐ SPLIT IT.

35:01.932 --> 35:04.484
‐ MMM, 60/40?
‐ FINE.

35:05.986 --> 35:10.280
‐ A CUPCAKE A. T. M.
‐ A <i>24‐HOUR</i> CUPCAKE A. T. M.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.863
WHAT A COUNTRY.

35:15.946 --> 35:18.619
MMM.

35:18.619 --> 35:20.621
‐ IT'S SWEET.
‐ MMM.

35:20.621 --> 35:23.163
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SWEET.
IT'S A CUPCAKE.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.745
‐ NO. I MEAN THIS.
‐ WHAT?

35:24.745 --> 35:27.838
THIS PLACE,
THIS TOWN, YOUR PAD.

35:27.838 --> 35:30.010
‐ YOU HAVE A GAZEBO.
‐ FANNY HAS A GAZEBO.

35:30.010 --> 35:32.092
YOUR ASS IS SITTING
IN IT RIGHT NOW.

35:32.092 --> 35:35.015
‐ TRUE, VERY TRUE.
‐ I LOVE IT HERE.

35:35.015 --> 35:36.597
‐ YOU DO?
‐ DON'T YOU?

35:36.597 --> 35:40.350
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING HERE.

35:40.350 --> 35:42.643
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A WHOLE DIFFERENT LIFE.

35:42.643 --> 35:45.475
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MARRIED‐‐ A SADIE.

35:45.475 --> 35:48.478
I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
A HUSBAND

35:48.478 --> 35:50.691
‐ AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO‐‐
‐ TO WHAT?

35:50.691 --> 35:54.114
I DON'T KNOW‐‐
BE REALLY HAPPY.

35:54.114 --> 35:56.076
NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE PLAN IS.

35:56.076 --> 35:58.989
YOU CAN'T BE REALLY HAPPY HERE
WITHOUT BEING A SADIE?

36:01.491 --> 36:04.454
‐ SO NEXT YEAR...
‐ UH‐HUH, MM‐HMM.

36:04.454 --> 36:08.128
‐ ...FOR MY BIRTHDAY‐‐
‐ I PROMISE I WILL BE
MORE PREPARED.

36:08.128 --> 36:09.750
‐ I'LL DO SOME PLANNING.
‐ OKAY.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.252
I'LL CHECK OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THE OTHER TOWNS.

36:12.252 --> 36:15.095
‐ IS THERE MORE TO SOLVANG
THAN WINDMILLS?
‐ THERE'S NOT.

36:15.095 --> 36:18.679
I'LL CHECK OUT CARMEL,
SCOPE OUT THE NIGHT LIFE
IN LOS OLIVOS,

36:18.679 --> 36:21.471
SEE WHAT THE KIDS ARE
UP TO IN CARPINTERIA.

36:21.471 --> 36:24.895
AND I'LL SEE IF
I CAN'T LIVEN THIS PLACE UP
A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THEN.

36:24.895 --> 36:27.107
IF ANYBODY CAN...

36:36.236 --> 36:37.988
THREE MORE MINUTES.

36:39.409 --> 36:42.122
BOY, THOSE TWO CAN
SLEEP IN ANY POSITION,
CAN'T THEY?

36:43.123 --> 36:44.414
BOO?

36:44.414 --> 36:45.956
‐ OH JEEZ.
‐ HEY!

36:45.956 --> 36:47.457
‐ PATHETIC.
‐ NO, DON'T!

36:47.457 --> 36:50.000
FORGET HIM, BOO.
YOU'LL MEET SOMEONE ELSE
JUST AS DUMB,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.422
DRIVING JUST AS CRAPPY
A CAR ANY DAY NOW.

36:52.422 --> 36:55.175
‐ I WAS SUPPOSED
TO TEXT THAT TO HIM.
‐ AND THEN WHAT?

36:55.175 --> 36:58.258
‐ AND THEN HE WOULD THANK ME.
‐ AND AFTER HE THANKS YOU

36:58.258 --> 37:00.641
FOR TEXTING HIM SOME
OTHER GIRL'S NUMBER,
THEN WHAT?

37:00.641 --> 37:03.263
I JUST LIKE HIM.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.055
I KNOW.

37:05.055 --> 37:07.938
YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT THOUGH.

37:07.938 --> 37:10.150
I KNOW.

37:12.482 --> 37:14.945
LOOK ONE MORE TIME
AND THE HAND GOES TOO.

37:21.121 --> 37:24.454

37:31.712 --> 37:34.374
WELL, YOU KNEW
THAT WAS COMING.

37:34.374 --> 37:36.547
IT WASN'T 100%.

37:36.547 --> 37:39.139
SO ARE YOU GOING TO GO?

37:39.139 --> 37:41.882
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING
TO STICK AROUND HERE
ALL SUMMER.

37:41.882 --> 37:44.765
‐ WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS SAY?
‐ I'LL TELL THEM WHEN
I GET BACK.

37:44.765 --> 37:47.437
‐ SASHA.
‐ LOOK, THEY WON'T EVEN
NOTICE I'M GONE.

37:47.437 --> 37:50.100
‐ TRUST ME.
‐ YOU CAN'T JUST UP AND LEAVE.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.442

ON THE THROW PILLOWS.

37:52.442 --> 37:54.484
