15:59.133 --> 16:01.633
- Shopping?
- For the bake sale.

16:01.633 --> 16:05.467
- Look, I can't talk right now.
- Fine. Then don't.

16:05.467 --> 16:09.900
Oh, wait.
I didn't mean it--

16:09.900 --> 16:13.267
Chicken a la king.
Boring, but safe.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.533
[ Ricky ]
I'm telling you guys. I didn't know.

16:18.533 --> 16:21.967
I thought I was putting them
in the chicken a la king.

16:21.967 --> 16:23.967
I don't think
he's our commander.

16:23.967 --> 16:26.967
[ Girl Creep ]
I think he's lying.

16:27.633 --> 16:30.633
[ Wart ]
Let's devour him like an insect.

16:32.133 --> 16:35.567
Maybe you should reveal
the real plan, Commander.

16:35.567 --> 16:38.233
Commander Ricky,
Sergeant Iris reporting for duty.

16:38.233 --> 16:39.600
Huh?

16:39.600 --> 16:43.167
I'm the second in command.
The first plan was a test.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.133
- [ Creeps Grunting ]
- To see if you creeps were ready.

16:46.133 --> 16:50.167
- Now we can put the real plan in action.
- [ Ricky ] We can?

16:50.167 --> 16:53.567
- [ Wart ] Tell us the real plan, Commander.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:53.567 --> 16:56.700
- Um, the real plan.
- Mm-hmm.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.100
Let's see. Well,

16:59.100 --> 17:02.000
we need to get everybody
to eat the identity seeds.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.433
- [ Creeps ] Yes, Commander.
- And, um,

17:04.433 --> 17:08.500
we have to put them in something
kids like to eat, right?

17:08.500 --> 17:13.967
- Yes, Commander.
- Well, what do kids like to eat?

17:14.433 --> 17:16.067
[ Wart ]
Uh, something sweet.

17:16.933 --> 17:19.267
[ Girl Creep ]
What about the bake sale tomorrow?

17:19.267 --> 17:22.400
We could bake cookies
and put the seeds in them.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.267
It's a brilliant idea.
Congratulations, Commander.

17:26.267 --> 17:29.267
Who can resist a free cookie?

17:29.267 --> 17:31.267
Then they'll all turn into creeps.

17:31.767 --> 17:34.267
And creeps will rule.

17:34.767 --> 17:36.767
Yeah, that's good.

17:36.767 --> 17:40.767
Um, Sergeant,
can I talk to you for a moment?

17:40.767 --> 17:43.500
Keep stirring.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.000
Listen, Sergeant.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.033
- Um, about the plan.
- You don't have to call me "Sergeant."

17:51.033 --> 17:54.033
- They can't hear us.
- Oh, thank you.

17:54.033 --> 17:57.200
Thank you.
You're really not one of them?

17:57.700 --> 18:01.933
Of course not. I was on my way to
meet you when I heard your voice.

18:01.933 --> 18:04.467
And then when I saw them,
I couldn't believe it.

18:04.467 --> 18:07.467
At first I freaked out,
and I almost ran away.

18:07.467 --> 18:10.300
I mean,
those creeps are real creepy.

18:10.300 --> 18:14.100
- Creepy? They're disgusting!
- I know.

18:14.100 --> 18:18.333
Then when I saw that they were gonna
attack you, I had to think of something.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.967
I'm glad you did,
but now what are we gonna do?

18:21.967 --> 18:26.733
- What if everyone at school eats the cookies?
- We'll figure something out.

18:26.733 --> 18:30.000
[ Creeps ]
Humans are the past.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Creeps are the future.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.967
Humans are the past.

18:33.967 --> 18:36.333
Creeps are the future.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.833
Humans are the past.

18:38.833 --> 18:40.700
- At least I hope we will.
- Creeps are the future.

18:40.700 --> 18:45.800
Humans are the past.
Creeps are the future.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.800
Humans are the past.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.600
[ Children Chattering ]

18:58.567 --> 19:02.433
I can't believe you're friends with
this creep. That makes you a creep too.

19:02.433 --> 19:07.100
Too bad. You looked like
you had potential. [ Laughs ]

19:07.600 --> 19:12.100
If she knew what a real creep was,
she wouldn't be laughing.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.767
Uh-oh.

19:18.267 --> 19:22.167
- We're ready, Commander.
- Listen, guys. I was thinking--

19:22.167 --> 19:25.933
Free cookies.
Chocolate chip.

19:25.933 --> 19:27.967
Come and get 'em.
Right this way.

19:27.967 --> 19:31.167
- [ Children Shouting ]
- Now what do we do?

19:31.167 --> 19:34.133
If they eat those cookies,
they're all going to turn into creeps.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.900
Wait. Stop!

19:41.900 --> 19:44.200
It's Ricky the Rat.
What does he want?

19:44.200 --> 19:47.433
[ All Chanting ]
Ricky the Rat. Ricky the Rat.

19:47.433 --> 19:50.133
- Ricky the Rat. Ricky the Rat.
- Wait. Listen to me!

19:50.533 --> 19:54.800
- You don't understand.
- Ricky the Rat. Ricky the Rat.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.900
Ricky the Rat.
Ricky the Rat.

19:57.900 --> 20:02.067
Commander, don't let these
stupid kids get to you.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.700
Once they eat the cookies,
you'll be their ruler.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.367
- Ricky the Rat. Ricky the Rat.
- Their ruler?

20:07.800 --> 20:10.267
- Of course. They'll be your slaves.
- Ricky the Rat.

20:10.267 --> 20:13.967
- They'll have to do anything you say.
- Ricky the Rat. Ricky the Rat.

20:13.967 --> 20:17.867
- Ricky the Rat. Ricky the Rat.
- Attention, everyone.

20:17.867 --> 20:20.667
I just wanted to say--
[ Grunts ]

20:20.667 --> 20:24.167
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Boy ] Loser!

20:24.167 --> 20:28.667
- I just wanted to say--
- [ Boy #2] Get off the stage. Go home.

20:30.167 --> 20:31.933
Enjoy the cookies.

20:31.933 --> 20:34.467
Ricky, no!

20:34.467 --> 20:36.633
What a creep.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.733
I'm sorry, Iris.

20:40.733 --> 20:45.233
But from now on, things are
gonna be different around here.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.167
[ Children ]
Long live Ricky. Long live Ricky.

20:51.167 --> 20:55.667
Long live Ricky. Long live Ricky.
Long live Ricky.

20:57.167 --> 21:00.233
- Ricky, now what do we do?
- Long live Ricky.

21:00.233 --> 21:05.500
- Long live Ricky. Long live Ricky.
- You know what they say, Iris.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.933
- If you can't beat 'em--
- No!

21:09.533 --> 21:13.500
Long live Ricky.
Long live Ricky.
