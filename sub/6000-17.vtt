00:00.023 --> 00:01.593
(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"...

00:01.619 --> 00:03.719
I've been wanting to
do that for a long time.

00:03.745 --> 00:04.970
They want to book the tour.

00:04.995 --> 00:06.733
26 cities, two months.

00:06.758 --> 00:07.680
I'll call you every night.

00:07.705 --> 00:08.705
I'll answer every night.

00:08.730 --> 00:10.147
The bar is not doing so great.

00:10.172 --> 00:11.609
We can charge whatever we want as cover.

00:11.634 --> 00:12.952
A guerilla rave.

00:12.977 --> 00:14.177
(cheering)

00:14.202 --> 00:15.755
We've already made more money tonight

00:15.780 --> 00:17.648
than the bar usually makes in a week.

00:17.673 --> 00:19.307
So it's a success.

00:19.332 --> 00:22.061
(man) You blew a 1.6 on the breathalyzer.

00:22.086 --> 00:23.296
You could have killed yourself.

00:23.321 --> 00:24.354
Or someone else.

00:24.422 --> 00:25.680
I don't need a lecture.

00:25.705 --> 00:26.771
Dude, she loves you.

00:26.796 --> 00:27.996
She cares about you.

00:28.021 --> 00:30.170
The social worker set
up a home study visit.

00:30.195 --> 00:32.101
What a nice show of
support, everyone being here.

00:32.351 --> 00:33.702
I've made some mistakes lately.

00:33.727 --> 00:35.313
The biggest mistake that I made

00:35.338 --> 00:36.295
is not telling you how I feel about you.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.553
I'm not 21.

00:37.578 --> 00:39.125
- I'm 17.
- You're 17?

00:39.178 --> 00:40.545
I'm still the same person.

00:40.570 --> 00:42.133
You need to go.

01:10.105 --> 01:11.548
as women in the restroom,

01:11.573 --> 01:14.808
but they're always finding
creative and disgusting new ways

01:14.833 --> 01:15.607
to trash it?

01:15.632 --> 01:17.299
They clean?

01:17.490 --> 01:19.324
Yeah. Now.

01:19.369 --> 01:21.183
Sparkling, actually.

01:21.208 --> 01:23.019
Can you clean those tables next?

01:23.044 --> 01:25.819
Stevie left early last
night, they're a mess.

01:25.974 --> 01:27.792
Jared?

01:29.584 --> 01:32.078
- Are we ever gonna have a real conversation again?
- Carter...

01:32.103 --> 01:33.603
You've barely spoken to me all week.

01:33.628 --> 01:36.558
I'm treating you an employee,
which you're lucky to be.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.402
I'm not big on being lied to.

01:38.426 --> 01:40.593
How many more times can I apologize?

01:43.923 --> 01:45.803
Jared.

01:56.729 --> 01:59.534
Wow... You do windows, too?

01:59.774 --> 02:01.238

02:01.263 --> 02:03.380
Uhh, banging your head against a wall

02:03.405 --> 02:05.740
burns 150 calories an hour.

02:05.773 --> 02:06.778
Does Bird know?

02:06.803 --> 02:08.526
She's getting bored with Pilates?

02:09.109 --> 02:11.911
So, um, we passed the home study.

02:11.987 --> 02:13.137
Oh, really?

02:13.162 --> 02:13.778
Yeah.

02:13.802 --> 02:15.372
I guess the social worker

02:15.397 --> 02:17.551
bought Lori's whole Susie Homemaker act,

02:17.576 --> 02:19.116
and you and David being there

02:19.141 --> 02:20.535
probably didn't hurt, either.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.066
So it's official now?

02:22.091 --> 02:23.091
You're staying in town?

02:23.116 --> 02:24.517
Yeah, I guess so.

02:24.542 --> 02:25.565
I'm glad.

02:25.590 --> 02:27.666
Hey, less talking, more cleaning.

02:27.691 --> 02:28.925
Oh, hey.

02:28.950 --> 02:32.465
- Jared, this is, uh, this is my brother.
- What's up?

02:32.490 --> 02:34.574
The candles on the front
tables need to be replaced.

02:37.143 --> 02:38.551
Who bit him?

02:38.576 --> 02:40.350
Me, apparently.

03:38.935 --> 03:40.297
I work here, Ben.

Do you have any idea how
much this job means to me?

- No, I'm not.
- Nothing I'm doing

03:46.147 --> 03:47.829
will affect his bottom line or yours,

03:47.854 --> 03:49.578
- it's a victimless crime.
- Oh, don't try and spin this

03:49.603 --> 03:50.577
like you're not hurting anyone,

03:50.602 --> 03:51.978
you're taking other people's money.

03:52.003 --> 03:53.577
It's the bank's money
and they cover any losses,

03:53.602 --> 03:55.420
so it's like it never happened.

03:56.513 --> 03:58.320
I have to tell Jared.

03:58.702 --> 04:00.517
If he finds out I knew about this

04:00.542 --> 04:02.296
and I didn't tell him, I will get fired.

04:02.321 --> 04:03.989
If I were you, I would think long and hard

04:04.014 --> 04:05.912
before I do anything stupid.

04:06.137 --> 04:08.205
Are you seriously threatening me?

04:08.230 --> 04:10.011
I'm saying don't mess with me.

04:10.724 --> 04:12.711
Not on this.

04:16.072 --> 04:17.492
Toothbrush.

04:17.516 --> 04:18.349
Packed.

04:18.374 --> 04:19.709
- Charger.
- Right here,

04:19.735 --> 04:22.211
where you put it two minutes ago.

04:23.153 --> 04:25.621
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

04:25.646 --> 04:28.783
You're like the most adorably
prepared person I've ever met.

04:28.808 --> 04:30.842
My head is all over the place.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.400
Are you nervous about the trip?

04:32.574 --> 04:33.808
No, it's a great school,

04:33.833 --> 04:35.395
and if you go to prospective
students' weekend,

04:35.420 --> 04:37.877
it shows you're really interested.

04:38.306 --> 04:40.006
But...

04:40.238 --> 04:43.474
I'm sort of anxious about Gabe coming.

04:43.698 --> 04:46.466
And I'm happy that he's
getting it together,

04:46.722 --> 04:50.591
you know, he's not blowing
everything off, but...

04:50.616 --> 04:54.791
You're afraid he's going
to rage all weekend.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.917
No.

04:56.942 --> 04:58.917
No, I...

05:03.773 --> 05:09.544
The other day, Gabe told me
that he has feelings for me.

05:09.569 --> 05:11.570
What did you say?

05:11.595 --> 05:14.063
That I love you.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.200
That's a good answer.

05:16.225 --> 05:18.760
So you're not upset?

05:18.948 --> 05:21.416
No, he's going through hard time.

05:21.441 --> 05:24.869
We should both probably cut him some slack.

05:25.781 --> 05:28.545
Besides, you're awesome,
so I can't really blame him

05:28.570 --> 05:29.703
for being into you.

05:29.728 --> 05:30.823
Seriously.

05:30.848 --> 05:35.385
As long as he's the only one
doing the feeling, I'm cool.

05:35.410 --> 05:36.577
He is.

05:36.602 --> 05:38.493
Completely.

05:39.236 --> 05:41.304
Then we're good.

05:41.529 --> 05:44.230
I love that I can tell you anything.

05:44.255 --> 05:45.622
Me too.

05:56.113 --> 05:58.114
Found a great venue downtown for the party.

05:58.139 --> 05:59.472
It's an old umbrella factory.

05:59.497 --> 06:01.947
Ooh, Mary Poppins chic.

06:01.972 --> 06:03.006
I like it.

06:03.031 --> 06:04.697
Yeah, nothing says fun like umbrellas.

06:04.722 --> 06:06.143
Come on, hustle up, ladies.

06:06.168 --> 06:08.022
It's all about turnover.

06:08.258 --> 06:11.360
I know he wants me to run point,
but this is still your show.

06:11.385 --> 06:12.886
Thanks. Means a lot.

06:12.919 --> 06:15.525
Of course.

06:24.899 --> 06:26.734
Wait a sec, wait.

06:26.759 --> 06:28.794
What are you doing?

06:29.082 --> 06:30.249
This looks different.

06:30.274 --> 06:32.105
Did you... Did you change it or something?

06:32.130 --> 06:33.133
No.

06:35.385 --> 06:38.217
The cord looks a little smaller.

06:38.783 --> 06:41.287
Someone much have switched it.

06:42.578 --> 06:44.045
How'd you spot that?

06:44.070 --> 06:44.848
I don't know.

06:44.873 --> 06:47.067
I guess I'm very detail oriented.

06:47.092 --> 06:47.992
I guess so.

06:48.017 --> 06:49.284
You got a really good eye.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.509
The last thing the bar
needs is for the customers

06:50.534 --> 06:52.667

Come on in.

07:56.845 --> 07:59.813
Um, so I washed this, I just
wanted to give it back to you.

07:59.838 --> 08:02.133
Oh, thanks, you didn't have to do that.

08:02.158 --> 08:03.877
Do you want something to drink?

08:03.902 --> 08:05.501
I think we have lemonade.

08:05.575 --> 08:07.175

08:10.011 --> 08:14.376
Well, honestly, it's been
hard having David away.

08:14.401 --> 08:16.572
You know, there's been
so much change lately

08:16.597 --> 08:18.330
with Carter leaving school.

08:18.355 --> 08:19.955
Me dropping into your life.

08:20.062 --> 08:21.652
You've been a good change.

08:21.677 --> 08:22.853
Sit down.

08:23.478 --> 08:25.650
We're just still finding our footing

08:25.699 --> 08:29.196
and it's a lot to juggle by myself.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.709
And I can't seem to get
that man on the phone.

08:31.734 --> 08:33.034
Have you talked to him?

08:33.058 --> 08:36.408
Yeah, he called me once and
we texted a couple times.

08:36.654 --> 08:37.953
So... That's good.

08:37.979 --> 08:40.179
But he seemed, like, super slammed, so...

08:40.205 --> 08:41.033
(distant banging)

08:41.058 --> 08:42.711
Oh, we're renovating the basement.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.227
Max is doing it.

08:44.253 --> 08:46.382
I just wanted a place where the
kids could bring their friends

08:46.407 --> 08:50.127
and hang out, you know,
away from parental eyes.

08:51.945 --> 08:54.439
You know, they're lucky
to have such a cool mom.

08:54.515 --> 08:55.752
Oh, I don't know about that.

08:55.777 --> 08:57.799
No, really, I mean, I don't know
many parents who would be cool

08:57.824 --> 09:00.359
with their teenage daughter
dropping out of school,

09:00.427 --> 09:03.552
I mean, you know, let
alone working at a bar.

09:04.093 --> 09:08.750
Yeah, we've always tried to
give her a pretty long leash.

09:14.314 --> 09:17.417
(music playing, chatter)

09:29.355 --> 09:31.089
Thank you.

09:31.351 --> 09:32.918
From before.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.685
Most employees wouldn't have
noticed it and hell, I didn't.

09:37.513 --> 09:41.338
Well, guess I'm not most employees.

09:45.135 --> 09:47.270
(Elizabeth) Carter?

09:57.943 --> 10:00.011
- Hi.
- How long have you been working here?

10:00.036 --> 10:01.537
Um...

10:01.562 --> 10:03.130
- Not long.
- Why didn't you tell me?

10:03.155 --> 10:05.552
Ben mentioned it like
it was common knowledge.

10:05.577 --> 10:06.844
- Ben did?
- Yes.

10:06.869 --> 10:08.444
I felt like an idiot.

10:10.747 --> 10:12.502
Well, I'm still kind of on trial,

10:12.527 --> 10:14.265
I didn't want to say anything
until I was permanent.

10:14.290 --> 10:15.523
Well, so much for that plan.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.064
Do you have any idea how old she is?

10:17.089 --> 10:18.638
(Carter) Yes, he does. I do.

10:18.663 --> 10:20.718
And she happens to be the
best employee that I have.

10:20.743 --> 10:21.913
I'm glad to hear that.

10:21.938 --> 10:24.305
That doesn't change the
fact that she's 17 years old.

10:24.330 --> 10:25.764
Mom, stop it.

10:25.789 --> 10:28.327
- Look...
- (man) What kind of a place is this?

10:28.352 --> 10:31.688
He didn't know about it
until, like, a week ago.

10:31.713 --> 10:33.942
That's true. How is that possible?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.933
He thought I was 21 when
I applied for the job.

10:36.958 --> 10:39.060
And why would he think that?

10:39.159 --> 10:42.942
Because I have an ID that says I'm 21.

10:46.060 --> 10:49.416
Oh, my God, there are tons
of activities, lectures.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.569
How are we gonna choose?

10:50.594 --> 10:52.833
I'm planning to focus on
quarters and keg stands.

10:52.858 --> 10:54.692
Ah, I've trained you well, my son.

10:54.717 --> 10:56.268
You know it.

10:56.293 --> 10:58.960
Me, on the other hand,
gonna keep it mellow.

10:58.985 --> 11:00.710
I need to stay on the straight and narrow.

11:00.735 --> 11:02.703
I'm not trying to be a buzz kill.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.062
I may really want to go there.

11:04.087 --> 11:06.510
I hear you. Message received.

11:08.169 --> 11:09.870
I won't screw it up, I promise.

11:09.895 --> 11:11.963
While you two are
majoring in good behavior,

11:11.988 --> 11:13.855
I'll be rebranding myself.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.210
What does that even mean?

11:15.235 --> 11:16.803
No one at the you knows me.

11:16.828 --> 11:18.694
So I can be whoever I want.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.173
I get it, you're gonna
pretend that you're cool.

11:20.198 --> 11:21.431
Exactly.

11:21.456 --> 11:23.524
I've waited my whole life to be a badass.

11:23.549 --> 11:24.549
(chortles)

11:24.574 --> 11:26.464
I cannot wait to see that.

11:26.489 --> 11:27.656
Me, too.

11:27.681 --> 11:31.100
Mr. Badass... Welcome to school.

11:31.305 --> 11:33.212
I don't know what's more impressive,

11:33.237 --> 11:35.092
the quality of this fake ID,

11:35.117 --> 11:36.825
or the depths to which you've deceived me.

11:36.850 --> 11:38.551
- Mom, would you please...
- No, against my better judgment,

11:38.576 --> 11:40.544
I let you drop out of
school and then I find out

11:40.569 --> 11:42.858
that you have been lying to me ever since?

11:42.883 --> 11:44.350
I have half a mind to call the liquor board

11:44.375 --> 11:45.542
and shut that place down.

11:45.567 --> 11:46.968
Mom, you can't punish the bar.

11:46.993 --> 11:49.395
If you couldn't tell my ID was
fake, how are they supposed to?

11:49.420 --> 11:51.749
You're walking on thin ice already.

11:51.774 --> 11:53.175
I'd be careful.

11:53.253 --> 11:55.768
Okay, I wanted to tell you a million times,

11:55.793 --> 11:57.427
but I knew you would react like this.

11:57.452 --> 11:59.319
Thank you for the vote of confidence.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.311
Was I wrong?

12:00.336 --> 12:01.603
Don't you think it's a little hypocritical?

12:01.628 --> 12:02.749
Excuse me?

12:02.774 --> 12:05.505
You had absolutely no problem
with Gabe drunk driving

12:05.530 --> 12:07.019
and crashing his car,

12:07.044 --> 12:09.148
but I'm earning an honest
living not hurting anyone

12:09.173 --> 12:10.373
and you want to throw the book at me?

12:10.398 --> 12:12.238
First of all, I did
have a problem with that,

12:12.263 --> 12:14.505
and second of all,
that's entirely different.

12:14.530 --> 12:16.531
Really? Because it looks
pretty much the same

12:16.556 --> 12:17.491
from where I'm standing.

12:17.516 --> 12:18.816
Where did you get this ID?

12:18.955 --> 12:20.522
I don't know, I've had it for ages.

12:20.547 --> 12:23.991
How am I supposed to trust you,
Carter, if you keep lying to me?

12:24.016 --> 12:25.483
Maybe I wouldn't have to keep lying to you

12:25.508 --> 12:27.776
if you had just a little
bit of faith in me.

12:27.801 --> 12:29.439
No, no, no, don't turn this on me.

12:29.727 --> 12:33.287
Mom, I love working in that bar.

12:33.312 --> 12:35.714
There's plenty of legal
jobs that you can get.

12:35.739 --> 12:38.308
Do you really see me working
in some office job somewhere?

12:38.333 --> 12:39.817
You're acting like you don't even know me.

12:39.842 --> 12:40.804
Look, you know why?

12:40.829 --> 12:42.853
It's hard to get to know
you when you don't let me in.

12:42.878 --> 12:46.375
I don't want you working there anymore.

12:47.407 --> 12:50.576
Well, that is not your call.

12:51.412 --> 12:52.779
Where are you going?

12:52.804 --> 12:56.173
I'm so tired of you
trying to run interference.

12:56.198 --> 12:58.375
I can take care of myself.

13:02.583 --> 13:05.683
What percent of students
take a semester abroad?

13:05.708 --> 13:06.875
(man) I'm not sure the exact number.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.067
Maybe a third of the juniors?

13:08.092 --> 13:09.726
Still thinking about going to Paris?

13:09.751 --> 13:11.332
I'm surprised you remember that.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.392
I have a good memory when I want to.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.051
You know, it's really starting to hit.

13:15.076 --> 13:18.178
Going to college means leaving home.

13:18.203 --> 13:21.566
I don't think I'm ready to
leave my family, leave Max.

13:21.591 --> 13:22.991
It's still a year away.

13:23.016 --> 13:25.680
I mean, plenty of time
to get used to the idea.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.676
I must sound pretty stupid.

13:27.701 --> 13:28.825
Not at all.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.637
I don't even know if I
want to go to college.

13:30.662 --> 13:32.729
It's just something my
dad assumed that I'd do.

13:32.754 --> 13:34.075
Well, you're here now.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.480
I thought this weekend would
help me make up my mind.

13:36.505 --> 13:38.025
So what's the verdict?

13:38.050 --> 13:39.525
Ask me on Sunday.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.624
I'm from a small village outside of London.

13:41.649 --> 13:44.117
In my spare time, I play in a band.

13:44.142 --> 13:45.525
So cool.

13:45.550 --> 13:46.424
What instrument?

13:46.449 --> 13:47.924
The guitar.

13:47.949 --> 13:50.025
(Gabe) Hey, how's the track team?

13:50.050 --> 13:51.225
(man) It's good.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.116
The star sprinter's graduating,

13:53.141 --> 13:54.308
so they're looking to rebuild.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.161
Really?

13:55.186 --> 13:55.919
You run?

13:55.944 --> 13:57.833
Uh, a little, yeah.

13:57.857 --> 13:59.067
Oh, he's being modest.

13:59.092 --> 14:00.316
He's very good.

14:00.341 --> 14:02.418
Well, I can take you by the field later.

14:02.443 --> 14:03.895
Talk to the coach.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.865
That'd be great.

14:06.696 --> 14:08.052
All right, everybody.

14:08.077 --> 14:08.918
That's it for the tour.

14:08.943 --> 14:11.466
Enjoy your visit.

14:12.224 --> 14:15.644
Hey, so there's a party tomorrow
in my fraternity... Psi Rho.

14:15.669 --> 14:16.936
You guys should stop by.

14:16.961 --> 14:19.301
- Uh...
- Yeah, we'll be there.

14:19.550 --> 14:20.791
Great.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.517
Thanks, Ned.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.476
You sure about that?

14:25.026 --> 14:26.848
It wouldn't be an authentic college weekend

14:26.873 --> 14:29.241
without a frat party, right?

14:30.161 --> 14:31.566
(music playing)

14:31.591 --> 14:34.890
♪ You say you wanted
to come down easy ♪

14:34.999 --> 14:38.968
♪ And it's always way to fast for me ♪

14:39.427 --> 14:42.390
I can't believe you told my
mom I was working at Magic Hour.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.191
I warned you not to mess with me.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.487
That was me protecting my
job, not screwing you over.

14:47.512 --> 14:48.893
It's the same thing.

14:48.918 --> 14:51.629
No, Ben, I would have never
ratted you out like that.

14:51.654 --> 14:53.431
All I did was tell him the
machine looked different,

14:53.456 --> 14:55.135
I didn't say anything about you.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.012
Okay, good, 'cause you
don't know anything about me

14:57.037 --> 14:58.596
or why I do what I do.

14:58.621 --> 14:59.973
Okay, well, then you know what, Ben?

14:59.998 --> 15:01.238
Explain it to me.

15:01.263 --> 15:02.229
I have all night.

15:02.254 --> 15:03.931
It's none of your business.

15:06.095 --> 15:08.849
My mom was all over me
about where I got my ID from

15:08.874 --> 15:10.608
and I didn't tell her that was you, either.

15:10.633 --> 15:12.570
Okay, well, that's your choice.

15:13.892 --> 15:15.226
You know what?

15:15.251 --> 15:17.709
You're not the only
person with problems, Ben.

15:17.734 --> 15:20.591
I'm trying to figure out
what the hell my life is,

15:20.616 --> 15:22.302
and it's not gonna get any easier now

15:22.327 --> 15:24.871
with my mom breathing down my neck.

15:26.418 --> 15:27.885
You know what?

15:28.054 --> 15:30.167
You're really not gonna
tell me what you're up to

15:30.192 --> 15:32.070
Then I am done covering for you.

15:32.489 --> 15:35.671
Seriously, from now on, you're on your own.

15:39.137 --> 15:40.249
(David) Hey, Sweetheart.

15:40.274 --> 15:41.441
Hey.

15:43.058 --> 15:44.374
Have you spoken to Mom?

15:44.399 --> 15:45.766
No, I just got out of a reading.

15:45.791 --> 15:46.857
What's up?

15:46.882 --> 15:49.884
So I got this job waitressing at a bar.

15:49.909 --> 15:51.655
A bar?

15:52.116 --> 15:53.316
Let me guess.

15:53.341 --> 15:54.827
Mom's not that thrilled about it.

15:54.852 --> 15:56.755
<i>She wants me to quit.</i>

15:56.780 --> 15:59.451
But Dad, I'm doing really well there

15:59.476 --> 16:01.777
<i>and for the first time
in a really long time,</i>

16:01.802 --> 16:03.535
<i>I'm actually happy.</i>

16:03.561 --> 16:06.347
But she wants me to stay a kid forever.

16:06.372 --> 16:08.740
All parents want that on some level.

16:08.765 --> 16:10.199
Your mom's no different.

16:10.224 --> 16:12.293
Okay, but there's a difference
between being protective

16:12.318 --> 16:13.619
and smothering me.

16:13.644 --> 16:14.684
All right, I'll talk to her.

16:14.709 --> 16:15.642
Let me get her side of it.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.168
Maybe there's a compromise.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.694
How's everything else?

16:18.719 --> 16:19.972
Fine, yeah.

16:19.997 --> 16:21.431
Oh, um...

16:21.456 --> 16:23.480
<i>Ben and Lori passed the home study.</i>

16:23.505 --> 16:24.772
What?

16:24.919 --> 16:26.048
That's great.

16:26.073 --> 16:26.902
Yeah.

16:26.927 --> 16:28.816
Apparently, the social
worker was very impressed

16:28.841 --> 16:30.275
that both of us were there.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.734
<i>Yeah?</i>

16:31.759 --> 16:32.926
<i>I'm so relieved.</i>

16:32.951 --> 16:35.422
<i>I've been on pins and
needles waiting to hear.</i>

16:38.316 --> 16:41.218
(banging)

16:41.243 --> 16:42.911
(Elizabeth) Hey.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.069
Hey.

16:44.094 --> 16:45.814
Thought maybe you needed a hand.

16:45.839 --> 16:46.939
Yeah.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.150
Have at it.

16:48.732 --> 16:50.540
Oh, wait. Safety first.

16:50.565 --> 16:52.466
Oh.

16:54.677 --> 16:58.179
(grunting)

16:59.885 --> 17:01.848
Watch yourself.

17:01.873 --> 17:03.764
No need.

17:04.622 --> 17:06.623
Sounds like Taylor's having fun.

17:06.691 --> 17:08.968
Yeah, she's been texting me
pictures, it's really pretty.

17:09.089 --> 17:09.989
Yeah.

17:10.013 --> 17:11.545
And I like that it's so close to home.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.003
I mean, I would never say no to Stanford,

17:13.029 --> 17:16.926
but I love the idea that
it's only a few hours away.

17:16.952 --> 17:17.741
It's weird, though.

17:17.767 --> 17:20.286
A few hours away feels a
lot further than I thought.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.913
Sometimes, you can be in the
same room as another person

17:22.938 --> 17:25.385
and feel 1,000 miles apart.

17:26.819 --> 17:28.086
Don't worry.

17:28.109 --> 17:30.482
Taylor is gonna be back before you know it.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.208
Here.

17:32.233 --> 17:33.633
Thanks.

17:33.658 --> 17:37.085
You know, Gabe went with her and Damon.

17:37.110 --> 17:38.410
Um...

17:38.859 --> 17:41.761
That's good, actually.

17:41.786 --> 17:45.264
Gabe, he hasn't seemed like he's
cared about school for a while.

17:45.289 --> 17:46.856
He cares about Taylor.

17:46.881 --> 17:49.149
And she loves you.

17:49.174 --> 17:51.085
I know.

17:52.051 --> 17:54.707
What city is David in right now?

17:54.732 --> 17:56.132
That's a good question.

17:56.157 --> 17:57.624
I have no idea.

17:57.649 --> 18:02.676
His communication skills
have been a bit lax lately.

18:04.285 --> 18:06.086
(grunting)

18:06.111 --> 18:07.260
(hissing)

18:07.285 --> 18:09.777
- What the hell?
- Ooh, we hit a pipe, hit a pipe.

18:09.802 --> 18:12.236
Uh, you know where the
water shutoff valve is?

18:12.261 --> 18:14.396
No, David always takes care of this stuff.

18:14.421 --> 18:16.421
(screaming)

18:19.471 --> 18:20.738
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:20.763 --> 18:22.030
Thanks for coming.

18:22.055 --> 18:24.221
Look, I have the best idea for the party.

18:24.246 --> 18:25.713
My girl's a genius.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.652
You should see this mural
that she did at my place.

18:27.677 --> 18:28.763
It belongs in a museum.

18:28.788 --> 18:30.904
Well, it helps when you
have the most amazing muse.

18:30.928 --> 18:32.520
Oh, baby, you're your own inspiration.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.371
So what's the great idea?

18:34.396 --> 18:35.825
I'm gonna be hanging thrift store umbrellas

18:35.850 --> 18:38.536
from the ceiling, light them
up and strobe it. I love it.

18:38.561 --> 18:40.903
You can go all new wave with
the music, alternative '80s.

18:40.928 --> 18:43.013
Did Stevie get a guy lined
up for the front door yet?

18:43.038 --> 18:44.013
Oh, that's on my list.

18:44.038 --> 18:45.606
Good... We wouldn't want anyone's mommy

18:45.631 --> 18:47.960
to come crash the party, would we?

18:51.571 --> 18:53.772
Tension much?

18:54.114 --> 18:56.582
Nothing I can't handle.

18:59.220 --> 19:03.899
(music playing, chatter)

19:08.525 --> 19:09.555
See?

19:09.580 --> 19:11.502
- Aren't you glad you came?
- Yeah.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.895
It feels like forever
since we just hung out.

19:14.053 --> 19:17.922
Look, I know I haven't been
easy to be around lately.

19:17.947 --> 19:22.217
I miss my dad and all, but
it's getting easier every day.

19:22.242 --> 19:25.244
Well, I'm glad.

19:25.269 --> 19:27.571
I couldn't have gotten
through it without you.

19:27.596 --> 19:29.631
Thanks.

19:29.656 --> 19:31.437
Friends forever.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.709
Friends forever.

19:35.555 --> 19:37.539
Oh, my God, what is he doing?

19:37.564 --> 19:39.088
(laughing)

19:39.113 --> 19:41.299
Only one way to find out, huh?

19:41.324 --> 19:43.592
There's nothing like
catching some serious air.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.125
You're all alone, surrounded
by mountains and snow.

19:46.150 --> 19:47.617
Yeah, snowboarding rules.

19:47.642 --> 19:49.209
Oh, hey, can you do a 360?

19:49.234 --> 19:50.300
In my sleep.

19:50.325 --> 19:51.774
That's amazing.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.978
You should see his signature jump.

19:54.003 --> 19:55.675
Oh, the Damonator.

19:55.700 --> 19:58.444
- What's that?
- Uh...

19:58.469 --> 19:59.437
Tell her, man.

19:59.462 --> 20:01.243
Yeah, it's where you...

20:01.268 --> 20:04.675
you start off facing backwards.

20:04.700 --> 20:05.734
Oh, my God.

20:05.759 --> 20:06.875
Mm-hmm, oh, yeah.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.235
So you go into the jump completely blind

20:09.260 --> 20:10.928
and then you do a 540,

20:10.953 --> 20:12.153
and you land right.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.548
You're a madman.

20:16.904 --> 20:20.373
I don't know what I would have
done if you hadn't been here.

20:20.398 --> 20:22.212
Turn it into an indoor pool.

20:22.237 --> 20:23.906
Grant would have liked that.

20:24.191 --> 20:25.191
Here you go.

20:25.216 --> 20:26.916
Thanks.

20:27.199 --> 20:30.848
Just feel like I can't do
anything right these days.

20:30.873 --> 20:31.958
It's just a broken pipe.

20:31.983 --> 20:32.739
We can fix it.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.799
It's not just the pipe, Max.

20:34.824 --> 20:36.625
Carter, she, uh...

20:36.859 --> 20:41.430
Doesn't trust me enough to
tell me what she's up to.

20:41.455 --> 20:43.757
We're barely speaking.

20:44.030 --> 20:46.758
Well, she's pushing her limits,
you know, that's what she does.

20:46.783 --> 20:49.639
I just feel like I'm banging
my head against a wall

20:49.664 --> 20:51.665
trying to get through to her.

20:51.733 --> 20:53.767
You can't take that personally.

20:53.792 --> 20:56.704
I know that intellectually.

20:56.729 --> 21:00.698
Believe it or not, I was once her age.

21:00.723 --> 21:04.659
You think you know
everything, but you don't.

21:04.684 --> 21:07.319
She wants to find her own path.

21:07.486 --> 21:09.359
Make it or break it on her terms.

21:09.384 --> 21:12.423
That's why I let her drop out of school.

21:12.761 --> 21:16.567
But this is what she wants
to do with her life, Max?

21:16.592 --> 21:19.441
Work illegally in some bar?

21:19.466 --> 21:25.574
I always feel like I'm failing her.

21:25.599 --> 21:27.644
It's hard to feel like mother of the year

21:27.669 --> 21:29.473
with that kind of outcome.

21:30.311 --> 21:33.901
(music playing)

21:34.322 --> 21:37.224
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

21:37.249 --> 21:39.202
You doing okay?

21:40.446 --> 21:42.514
Not really.

21:42.682 --> 21:44.225
Well, he's an idiot if he doesn't see

21:44.250 --> 21:47.086
how fabulous you are?

21:47.111 --> 21:48.078
So...

21:48.103 --> 21:49.885
You and Seth seem cozy.

21:49.910 --> 21:51.577
Beyond.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.469
He's ridiculously perfect.

21:53.494 --> 21:54.794
I'm really happy for you.

21:54.819 --> 21:56.220
We lost the umbrella factory.

21:56.245 --> 21:57.179
What?

21:57.204 --> 21:59.042
Why? What happened?

21:59.067 --> 22:00.801
The EPA declared it a toxic playground.

22:00.826 --> 22:02.193
That's why it was empty.

22:02.218 --> 22:04.720
I was gonna make it crazy beautiful, too.

22:04.745 --> 22:06.122
It's okay, it's okay.

22:06.147 --> 22:07.358
The party's not for three more days,

22:07.397 --> 22:08.343
we'll figure something out.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.511
No, we're not gonna be able
to lock down another venue.

22:10.536 --> 22:12.847
If we pull the plug now,
we can cut our losses.

22:12.872 --> 22:14.840
You're just gonna give up?

22:14.865 --> 22:16.932
Look, this isn't personal, Carter.

22:16.957 --> 22:19.125
I'm trying to make a
smart business decision.

22:22.615 --> 22:24.293
Jared.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.473
This isn't just about you, Jared.

22:26.498 --> 22:28.965
All of us have put a lot of
time and effort into this party.

22:28.990 --> 22:30.812
But the bottom line has my name on it.

22:30.837 --> 22:33.539
Right, so I guess you're the
one who needs it the most, then.

22:33.564 --> 22:35.669
Look, the money from the
parties is the only thing

22:35.694 --> 22:37.526
between keeping the lights on in this place

22:37.551 --> 22:38.918
and shutting the door for good.

22:38.943 --> 22:40.277
You just don't quit, do you?

22:40.302 --> 22:41.135
Nope.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.494
Okay, then what is your solution?

22:42.519 --> 22:43.452
I don't have one.

22:43.477 --> 22:44.821
But I will find one.

22:44.846 --> 22:46.401
You better find it fast,
because if you don't have a venue

22:46.426 --> 22:48.722
by tonight, the parties are over.

22:51.705 --> 22:53.900
I still remember my mother's
face when she found out

22:53.925 --> 22:56.363
I was waitressing at a jazz club.

22:56.388 --> 22:57.455
How old were you?

22:57.508 --> 22:59.275
17.

22:59.625 --> 23:01.336
By my mother's reaction,
you would have thought

23:01.361 --> 23:03.362
that I was working as a drug mule.

23:03.387 --> 23:05.475
Joan seems like she would
roll with anything, though.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.707
Oh, well, back then, she
was more tightly wound.

23:07.732 --> 23:11.241
She kept calling the club a speakeasy.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.049
It's kind of ironic, though, right?

23:13.074 --> 23:15.131
Yeah, it's really ironic.

23:15.597 --> 23:18.421
The hardest part about
having children, Max,

23:18.446 --> 23:19.813
is that you want to help them avoid

23:19.838 --> 23:22.931
making the same stupid
mistakes that you made

23:22.956 --> 23:25.608
and still letting them find their own way.

23:25.633 --> 23:28.168
I mean, I think that's true
of all relationships, though.

23:32.227 --> 23:34.295
This weekend has been hard enough.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.651
I have no idea what's
gonna happen with Taylor

23:36.676 --> 23:37.971
goes to college for real.

23:37.996 --> 23:39.230
Taylor loves you.

23:39.255 --> 23:41.323
And I trust her completely.

23:41.348 --> 23:43.048
Gabe, on the other hand...

23:43.073 --> 23:44.326
She can handle Gabe.

23:44.351 --> 23:46.519
She's had plenty of practice.

23:46.544 --> 23:47.982
Yeah, I guess.

23:48.007 --> 23:49.345
You have nothing to worry about.

23:49.370 --> 23:51.905
Taylor and Gabe, they're,
like, best friends,

23:51.930 --> 23:53.682
like you and Carter.

23:53.799 --> 23:55.482
We're so different, though.

23:55.507 --> 23:58.182
That's why you work, 'cause
you complement each other.

23:58.964 --> 24:00.164
Still.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.190
I wonder...

24:02.543 --> 24:04.962
if she would be better off with someone

24:04.987 --> 24:06.281
she had more in common with.

24:06.306 --> 24:11.953
I might not know the difference
between a monkey wrench

24:11.978 --> 24:15.882
and a crescent wrench,
but I do know my daughter,

24:15.907 --> 24:19.096
and you make her incredibly happy.

24:21.464 --> 24:24.033
(music pumping, loud chatter)

24:24.058 --> 24:26.894
I had no idea the campus was so beautiful.

24:27.387 --> 24:29.889
Yeah, the website doesn't
give you the full vibe.

24:29.914 --> 24:32.811
You kind of have to
experience it I-R-L.

24:32.836 --> 24:34.612
Can you see yourself going
to school here, though?

24:34.637 --> 24:35.604
Oh, definitely.

24:35.629 --> 24:37.396
Excellent.

24:39.878 --> 24:41.679
Let me get you a refill.

24:42.253 --> 24:43.854
Thank you.

24:46.232 --> 24:48.300
Hey.

24:48.325 --> 24:50.209
Hey. What's up?

24:50.457 --> 24:52.008
Look.

24:52.033 --> 24:53.800
I get that you are still pissed,

24:53.825 --> 24:56.093
but you have got to find
a way to move past this.

24:56.134 --> 24:57.468
Yeah, why is that?

24:57.493 --> 25:00.395
Because I am damn good at my job, Jared.

25:00.420 --> 25:04.806
And where you like to admit
it or not, you kind of like me.

25:05.050 --> 25:07.349
Because you're so irresistible.

25:08.069 --> 25:09.791
You said it.

25:10.051 --> 25:11.836
You're okay.

25:12.365 --> 25:15.135
No, actually, I'm fantastic.

25:15.160 --> 25:18.162
I just found us another
venue for the party.

25:18.419 --> 25:21.359
It's an abandoned drive-in
around seven miles out of town.

25:21.384 --> 25:23.719
The Star Shine? Yeah, I used
to go there back in the day.

25:23.744 --> 25:26.627
There's a ton of parking and
there's no one around for miles

25:26.652 --> 25:28.641
so you don't have to worry about noise.

25:28.666 --> 25:30.100
Look at you.

25:30.375 --> 25:33.577
Pulling another rabbit out of your hat.

25:33.602 --> 25:36.537
I might have to stop underestimating you.

25:36.562 --> 25:38.396
Yeah, you really might.

25:40.529 --> 25:42.327
David, it's me again.

25:42.352 --> 25:44.689
I really need to talk to you.

25:49.434 --> 25:52.839
Still trying to decide if I
want to go to a big university

25:52.864 --> 25:54.127
or a smaller college.

25:54.152 --> 25:56.601
I mean, I'm number one in my
class, so I should have choices.

25:56.626 --> 25:59.580
If you're number one in your
class, then I'm Nicki Minaj.

25:59.605 --> 26:00.229
It's the truth.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.388
You can ask anyone.

26:01.413 --> 26:02.613
Look, we all go on these weekends

26:02.638 --> 26:04.432
and pretend like we're more than we are,

26:04.457 --> 26:05.956
but you can be honest with me.

26:05.981 --> 26:06.964
Hey, have you seen Taylor?

26:06.989 --> 26:08.515
Gabe, tell her I'm number one in our class.

26:08.540 --> 26:10.168
Yeah, he is.

26:10.318 --> 26:12.097
Have you? Seen her?

26:12.122 --> 26:14.590
Yeah, she was talking to that tour guide.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.502
That was a while ago.

26:16.835 --> 26:19.295
It's not like her just to take
off without saying something.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.288
Maybe she went to a
seminar on overachieving.

26:22.313 --> 26:24.061
Yeah, maybe.

26:25.788 --> 26:27.822
♪

26:27.847 --> 26:30.835
Right in here.

26:30.860 --> 26:34.212
My legs feel all gummy.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.066
Where are we?

26:43.091 --> 26:45.992
Where's Damon and Gabe.

26:46.599 --> 26:47.833
You should lie down.

26:47.858 --> 26:50.059
You'll feel much better.

26:50.481 --> 26:52.035
No, let's just go back.

26:52.060 --> 26:53.410
Let's get you in bed.

26:53.435 --> 26:55.616
I want to call Max.

26:55.801 --> 26:58.915
You're gonna have a much better
time if you follow my lead.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.185
Stop fighting me!

27:04.510 --> 27:07.979
♪

27:18.048 --> 27:20.142
<i>I don't feel good.</i>

27:20.301 --> 27:22.782
- I want to sleep.
- Don't you ever shut up?

27:22.807 --> 27:24.384
Taylor!

27:34.052 --> 27:36.286
I heard your conversation
with your dad this morning,

27:36.311 --> 27:37.611
all of it.

27:38.008 --> 27:39.375
And Carter, you can't do that.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.396
You can't play both sides
to the middle, it's not fair.

27:42.421 --> 27:43.754
Okay, let me just explain what I was...

27:43.779 --> 27:44.694
It's not just that.

27:44.719 --> 27:46.753
You both have been lying to me.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.499
How many times have you been at Lori's?

27:49.746 --> 27:51.241
Just the once.

27:51.266 --> 27:53.901
And it was only to help Ben.

27:55.604 --> 27:57.611
You're looking at me in the eye

27:57.636 --> 28:00.351
and I still don't know if
you're telling me the truth.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.172
Really?

28:03.600 --> 28:07.129
I am, and I'm sorry I
didn't tell you before.

28:07.154 --> 28:08.934
I'm sorry, too.

28:09.590 --> 28:12.859
But I am tired of being on the losing side.

28:12.884 --> 28:16.087
So Carter, work at the bar.

28:16.154 --> 28:17.172
Do what you want.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.492
Clearly, you will anyway.

28:19.517 --> 28:21.952
Mom, wait.

28:22.357 --> 28:24.591
I don't want to fight with you.

28:24.616 --> 28:26.050
Neither do I.

28:26.310 --> 28:28.224
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about my job,

28:28.249 --> 28:30.483
I know I should have.

28:30.508 --> 28:34.193
It means the world to me that
you're letting me keep it.

28:36.259 --> 28:38.794
Things are hard enough with your dad away.

28:38.972 --> 28:41.279
I need to know that I can trust you.

28:41.304 --> 28:43.973
You can, I promise.

28:44.341 --> 28:45.608
Look...

28:45.633 --> 28:47.828
From now on, I will be an open book.

28:47.853 --> 28:49.074
Okay?

28:49.272 --> 28:53.442
Which is why I'm going to tell
you that I need to get to work.

28:53.467 --> 28:55.568
Okay.

28:55.593 --> 28:57.260
But, um...

28:57.375 --> 29:00.577
You might want to switch
out your heels for sneakers.

29:00.661 --> 29:01.728
I'll be fine.

29:01.753 --> 29:03.354
No, your feet will thank you for it.

29:03.379 --> 29:04.265
Bye, Mom.

29:04.290 --> 29:05.891
Bye.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.442
Is she okay?

29:14.467 --> 29:15.567
Yeah.

29:15.592 --> 29:16.759
Just stay with her, all right?

29:16.784 --> 29:17.751
Yeah, sure.

29:17.776 --> 29:19.243
Where are you going?

29:19.268 --> 29:20.284
Just do what I'm asking.

29:20.309 --> 29:21.777
I'll be back in a minute.

29:26.395 --> 29:28.096
♪

29:28.121 --> 29:29.628
Just give us a minute.

29:29.653 --> 29:31.732
Dude!

29:31.893 --> 29:33.013
What's your deal?

29:33.038 --> 29:34.505
My deal is you're a scumbag.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.961
That was for me.

29:37.986 --> 29:39.956
That was for Taylor.

29:39.981 --> 29:41.756
(laughing)

29:41.781 --> 29:44.049
Maybe next time you'll think
twice about drugging somebody,

29:44.074 --> 29:45.441
you freak.

29:45.466 --> 29:47.834
(single person clapping)

29:54.677 --> 29:55.986
Oh, hey.

29:56.011 --> 29:57.945
I thought you already left.

29:57.970 --> 30:00.372
I don't really have anywhere I need to be.

30:00.397 --> 30:01.331
Yeah.

30:01.356 --> 30:02.597
I know the feeling.

30:03.838 --> 30:05.539
Thanks again for today.

30:05.564 --> 30:06.797
Yeah.

30:06.822 --> 30:07.822
No big deal.

30:07.933 --> 30:09.142
Well, it is to me.

30:09.167 --> 30:11.135
You know, broken pipe aside.

30:11.203 --> 30:12.670
I think we make a pretty good team.

30:12.695 --> 30:14.430
Yeah, me too.

30:14.539 --> 30:17.120
I think you have a serious
future in demolition.

30:17.145 --> 30:21.230
Yeah, you know, if this
cop stuff doesn't work out.

30:22.170 --> 30:24.535
What's the latest on Taylor?

30:24.894 --> 30:27.505
She's been really quiet,
so I'm guessing that means

30:27.530 --> 30:30.150
she's having a really great time.

30:31.466 --> 30:33.066
But you're not convinced.

30:33.091 --> 30:34.792
No, I'm being a little ridiculous.

30:34.817 --> 30:36.046
Or human.

30:36.071 --> 30:37.137
Is there a cure for that?

30:37.162 --> 30:38.982
Yes, it says right here.

30:39.007 --> 30:41.723
Kung pow works wonders.

30:41.748 --> 30:44.122
The universe provides.

30:49.980 --> 30:51.808
Bouncer nailed down for the party.

30:51.833 --> 30:54.364
Oh, and I ordered a backup generator.

Don't want a repeat of last time.

30:56.882 --> 30:58.590

You're welcome.

(chuckles)

31:02.058 --> 31:03.892
Thank you.

31:03.917 --> 31:05.789
Much better.

31:09.208 --> 31:12.344
Is it my imagination or are
things warming up in here?

31:12.624 --> 31:15.461
I think the needle has gone from
"I can't stand the sight of you"

31:15.486 --> 31:17.587
to "Mildly acceptable employee."

31:17.612 --> 31:18.912
You're a lot more than that.

31:18.937 --> 31:19.819
Thanks.

31:19.844 --> 31:22.312
Not to him, I guess.

31:22.337 --> 31:23.437
Forget him.

31:23.462 --> 31:25.528
There are a whole lot of fish in that sea

31:25.553 --> 31:27.454
that would be thrilled to swim with you.

31:27.479 --> 31:29.146
Thank you.

31:38.991 --> 31:41.426
(phone ringing)

31:47.909 --> 31:49.176
Hey.

31:49.244 --> 31:51.419
I'm starting to think
you were dodging my calls.

31:51.444 --> 31:53.037
You saw my itinerary.

31:53.062 --> 31:54.187
They have me going...

31:54.212 --> 31:56.414
I heard your phone call
with Carter this morning.

31:56.727 --> 31:58.094
Liz.

31:58.119 --> 32:02.084
I know about the home visit,
that you went to see Lori.

32:02.557 --> 32:04.485
Why didn't you tell me?

32:05.213 --> 32:08.014
I didn't want to upset you.

32:08.039 --> 32:12.853
I don't know when it happened,
but at some point, I...

32:13.088 --> 32:16.126
I became this person that's
hard to share things with

32:16.151 --> 32:18.866
and you became a person
that would rather hide

32:18.891 --> 32:20.869
than confront an issue.

32:22.054 --> 32:24.822
I don't want us to be like that.

32:24.914 --> 32:27.514
Me either.

32:29.039 --> 32:30.965
(sighs)

32:36.411 --> 32:38.345
Got a new machine.

32:38.538 --> 32:40.749
This one has anti-fraud software built in,

32:40.774 --> 32:43.673
so if anyone tries to mess
with it, an alarm goes off.

32:43.698 --> 32:45.472
Very high tech.

32:49.092 --> 32:52.126
So I put a lot of thought into
it and I think it was Stevie

32:52.151 --> 32:54.547
who switched out the old machine.

32:55.079 --> 32:56.532
What? No, come on,

32:56.557 --> 32:57.623
Stevie is super loyal.

32:57.648 --> 32:58.875
Yeah, when it suits her.

32:59.029 --> 33:02.271
Hey, I like her too, but
she's always short on money

33:02.296 --> 33:05.249
and I caught her cutting corners
before, adding tips to bills,

33:05.274 --> 33:07.587
lifting the occasional bottle of top shelf.

33:08.868 --> 33:10.612
It's small time stuff.

33:10.637 --> 33:11.781
It comes with the territory.

33:11.806 --> 33:14.974
I'm the only bartender I've
ever had who didn't steal.

33:14.999 --> 33:16.451
Jared, I really don't think Stevie

33:16.476 --> 33:17.109
would have done something...

33:17.134 --> 33:18.701
Hey, I tried to be understanding.

33:19.072 --> 33:23.320
Everyone has bad days,
but this is a new low.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.100
I'm gonna fire her.

33:25.489 --> 33:27.023
What? Jared, you can't fire her.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.115
I have to.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.826
I don't trust her.

33:32.981 --> 33:34.490
Jared, it wasn't Stevie

33:34.515 --> 33:37.927
that switched out the credit card reader.

33:37.951 --> 33:40.936
It was my brother, Ben.

33:52.285 --> 33:54.987
Ben, Jared knows you swapped
out the credit card reader,

33:55.012 --> 33:57.581
and in case I need to say it, he's pissed.

33:57.854 --> 34:01.190
So wipe your laptop or burn the
paper trail or do whatever it is

34:01.215 --> 34:03.016
you need to do to get rid of the evidence.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.674
Well, thank you for
throwing me under the bus.

34:04.699 --> 34:06.643
I had to, Ben, he thought
it was one of the other girls

34:06.668 --> 34:08.130
and she was about to lose her job.

34:08.155 --> 34:10.356
You have no idea what you just did.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.284
Then tell me, Ben.

34:15.995 --> 34:19.065
I can't help you if you
keep shutting me out.

34:21.878 --> 34:24.447
All right, look, I have a
friend who's in a bad situation

34:24.514 --> 34:26.449
and she needs money and I
don't make enough selling IDs

34:26.474 --> 34:27.841
to dig her out.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.234
I was just using the bar
to get some extra cash.

34:30.259 --> 34:32.560
That girl I saw you
with a couple weeks ago?

34:32.585 --> 34:34.186
Yeah.

34:34.210 --> 34:36.215
Now you screwed everything up
and I have to get a new plan,

34:36.239 --> 34:38.273
so thank you for nothing.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.330
What are we... Where are we... going?

34:58.355 --> 35:00.191
Home.

35:00.388 --> 35:03.157
How are you feeling?

35:03.646 --> 35:06.181
Like my head got hit by a bus.

35:06.206 --> 35:07.640
I'm sure.

35:07.665 --> 35:10.391
I don't remember drinking
that much last night.

Taylor...

much about waitressing?

It's an old story.

36:38.558 --> 36:42.294
When I was your age, there
was this great place downtown,

36:42.319 --> 36:47.991
it's not there anymore, and
it was full of brick and neon.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.132
Smoky.

36:50.157 --> 36:52.437
And there would be a line outside the door

38:25.125 --> 38:26.575
So?

38:26.600 --> 38:28.934
Is this is where you
fire me in a public place

38:28.959 --> 38:31.232
