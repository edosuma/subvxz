it should have a great,

I need to say a couple things.

{\an3}On my season, I won
every single flash challenge

06:23.983 --> 06:25.918
until they didn't listen to me.

06:25.985 --> 06:27.787
{\an3}So, I'm going to tell you
what I know.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.555
<i>- Testing composition,</i>
<i>they're gonna have to create</i>

06:29.622 --> 06:31.290
{\an8}a couple different elements
that play together well

06:31.357 --> 06:33.092
{\an8}so that they can compose
an image.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.627
- What if we did,
like, a teepee?

06:34.694 --> 06:37.630
{\an1}- In my mind,
that would be very elementary.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.332
<i>- If you do something flat,</i>

06:39.398 --> 06:41.467
the idea of composition
isn't there.

06:41.534 --> 06:44.203
{\an1}- My thought was possibly,
like, a cherry blossom tree.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.938
- That was my first thought,
too, was to do a little tree.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.306
- Okay.
- Yeah.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.776

These guys only have
a few hours.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.750
- My initial idea
is doing a castle.

06:57.817 --> 07:00.253
{\an3}- It's almost the first idea
that someone would have,

07:00.319 --> 07:02.755
{\an3}so to me,
it's not actually that creative.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.190
{\an8}I'm an artist.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.892
{\an8}I don't want
to see something I've seen

{\an8}a hundred [bleep] thousand times
before.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.797

just flat tiers,

07:13.900 --> 07:16.135

07:16.202 --> 07:18.938
{\an3}right at the pinnacle
of the thing.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.339
The ball's, like,
slightly leaning

07:20.406 --> 07:21.974
like it wants to go,

07:22.041 --> 07:23.876
{\an3}and then you just have,
like, one little guy,

07:23.943 --> 07:26.712
like, pushing the ball, like,
uphill, trying to get it over.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.181

this tree at the base?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.492

<i>with a tree,</i>

07:42.728 --> 07:44.230
<i>it's great,</i>

{\an8}We can branch out
into all different dimensions,

07:46.599 --> 07:49.602
{\an8}and make sure we make it flow
and look really cohesive.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.971

it's like, holy shit,
like, I did that,

40:32.630 --> 40:35.399
and nobody really got me here
but me, so...

40:35.466 --> 40:44.842

<i>male narrator: On the next</i>
<i>episode of "Ink Master"...</i>

40:48.612 --> 40:50.681
- We're stronger
than those girls.

40:50.748 --> 40:52.383
<i>I say we send one</i>
<i>of them home again</i>

40:52.449 --> 40:54.418
and even up
this [bleep] competition.

40:54.485 --> 40:57.054
- If anything, it's just gonna
get more and more intense.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.689
- Laura, time ended,
like, ten minutes ago.

40:58.756 --> 41:01.859
What are you doing?
- I'm kind of worried.

41:01.926 --> 41:04.728

and you gotta hit soon.

41:13.838 --> 41:14.972
This is where
you go out swinging.

41:15.039 --> 41:16.874
- I feel so scared.
