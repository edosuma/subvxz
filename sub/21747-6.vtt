break might do us good. - Jamie's wife going?

- You have to leave George. - You
know I have no money of my own.
- I know his finances better than he does.

I am NOT going to stand by and see Adam

00:18.560 --> 00:20.230
Do you do business courses?

00:20.280 --> 00:25.590
- At the first sign of trouble, you

- Just now.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.430

- Well, he's due one.

In the Rush Hour Crush
section. Hang on a minute.

Yeah, here it is --
"Monday, Chapter One Books."

04:14.520 --> 04:18.550
"The sexy blonde who trashed my literary
taste, raved about The Deep End."

04:18.600 --> 04:22.270
- "Fancy hearing my critique?"
- Oh, my God, he's describing me.

'I had a few minutes

04:35.280 --> 04:37.670
Excuse me, could you give me some advice?

04:37.720 --> 04:43.230
Oh, sorry, I don't work here. I was
just, sort of, rearranging the shelves.

Chick lit -- it's not really my thing.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.270
What is, then?

An SAS shoot-'em-up where our hero
single-handedly saves the world and gets
the girl?

05:03.400 --> 05:06.270
- No, I'm waiting for the movie
on that one. - Too many words?

05:07.320 --> 05:10.880
- Perhaps a colouring book, then.
- Not unless it's won the Booker.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.510
I like good literature.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.760
Well...

show emotion, it might move you to tears.

- Oh, wow! The guy must love a challenge.
- Come on, it's not that difficult a read.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.350
No, I mean, the fact that he wants a date.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.790
- You are gonna meet him.
- No, he could be a complete nutter.

05:42.840 --> 05:47.350
You were rearranging the shelves.
He is prepared to overlook that.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.390
- Mm.
- Yeah.

05:49.440 --> 05:53.150
Oh, come on! You said he
was really attractive.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.470
Yeah, he was quite.

05:56.520 --> 06:00.950
He's clearly very intelligent.
He used the word, "Critique."

06:33.360 --> 06:36.470
Bollocks. Look, we
shouldn't be seen talking.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.230
We haven't been.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.190
That's how the rumour started.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.710
What?

06:41.760 --> 06:46.870
They got used to seeing us at the coffee
machine discussing last night's Question Time

06:46.920 --> 06:49.360
and since the away day, nothing.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.670
It's like we're avoiding each other.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.240
We are. Well, I am.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.750
- I don't want to start tongues wagging.
- Congratulations, you have.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.440
- What should we do about it?
- Nothing.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.190
Right...

07:06.240 --> 07:09.270
You mean, go back to avoiding each other?

07:09.320 --> 07:13.310
- No, just go back to how
we were before. - Before?

07:13.360 --> 07:14.760
OK.

07:15.760 --> 07:21.670
- I didn't see last night's Question
Time. - You're very literal. Has
anyone ever told you that before?

07:21.720 --> 07:26.630
- How have you been? - You mean, since you
started avoiding me? - I suppose I do, yeah.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.440
- I've got a lot more work done.
- I've hardly done any.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.150
- Are you out of your mind?
- What? - You can't kiss her.

07:40.200 --> 07:45.670
- Don't even think about kissing
her. - I can't help it. - Well,
don't. Next time I'll cut your balls off.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.910
Are you all right?

07:47.960 --> 07:51.910
Yeah, I was just having a
debate with my conscience.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.350
Who's winning?

07:53.400 --> 07:57.030
My conscience. He hits harder.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.910
Shame.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.880
Yeah.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.510
- I should be getting home.
- Well, good to talk.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.200
- Yeah, we should do it more often.
- You know where the coffee machine is.

have done with this when I was at school."

- Huh! He needs to attend one himself.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.880
Yeah, but not his own and for
that very reason, Babs, I am out.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.670
At least he gave it a go.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.990

your face, sneering at others, isn't it?

loop of 300 feet of cotton

09:32.280 --> 09:37.470
I actually think the product does need some
work but I like the person behind the product.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.270
I'm going to make you an offer, Jenny.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.920
You've always been my favourite, Deborah.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.440
Eh, nah, I'm out.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.150
- Mum, give us a second.
- Oh, love,

09:59.200 --> 10:03.360

you say. Just pretend I'm not here.

the effort, going to the gym,

10:11.840 --> 10:15.540
- taking more pride in my appearance. Can
you say the same thing? - About the gym?

10:15.590 --> 10:17.280
What do you do?

10:19.360 --> 10:24.030
Nothing! Just slob on
the couch pigging out.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.950
You need to stop watching
life, start living it.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.440
I'm happy!

10:30.480 --> 10:32.840
Well, maybe you shouldn't be.

10:55.260 --> 10:58.170
So, have you got something
you'd like to tell me?

10:58.220 --> 11:01.180
Well, somebody seems to think I have.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.730
Hm, going through the bathroom bin again?

11:06.780 --> 11:12.170
- In my experience, women tend to
use these things when they think
they might be pregnant. - True.

11:12.220 --> 11:15.130
The use of it doesn't
necessarily mean that you are.

11:15.180 --> 11:17.530
And I'm not.

11:17.580 --> 11:21.180
I know. I got a second opinion.
The other one said, "No", as well.

11:23.260 --> 11:25.850
I think we should get
ourselves checked out.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.330
Oh, bollocks to that!

11:27.380 --> 11:32.730
Adam, the amount of sex we've been
having, it's like running down
Sniper Alley and not getting hit.

11:32.780 --> 11:38.290
Plastic beakers and wank mags. I've been
down this road before with Rachel. I'm fine.

11:38.340 --> 11:42.860
- He's fine. They are fine.
- That was 20 years ago.

11:44.420 --> 11:46.370
Maybe they're not.

11:46.420 --> 11:47.730
Rude.

11:47.780 --> 11:51.570
Look, you don't even have to go to
the clinic to get tested any more.

11:51.620 --> 11:55.010
- You can do it from the comfort
of your own home. - Really?

11:55.060 --> 12:00.050
Mm, and if you play your cards
right, I might give you a hand.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.780
Mmm.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.660
- I got your call. It sounded urgent.
- Nikki's left me.

12:11.260 --> 12:15.020
- What? - We had a row this morning.
She's packed her bags and gone.

12:18.660 --> 12:20.780

12:21.780 --> 12:24.100

- No!

12:25.260 --> 12:27.410
She told you that, did she?

12:27.460 --> 12:29.140
I guessed.

12:31.260 --> 12:34.530
- Well...
- I bet that bastard's behind it.

12:34.580 --> 12:37.370
- What bastard?
- Todd. You met him at the barbecue.

12:37.420 --> 12:40.570
- He's always all over Nikki.
- Oh, yes.

12:43.340 --> 12:48.730
- I did notice they were rather tactile. - Yeah,
I've known for a while there's another bloke.

12:48.780 --> 12:52.450
- You once thought it was me.
- I'll kill the bastard if it's true.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.890
- Find out for me.
- What?

12:54.940 --> 12:59.170
- She trusts you. - I don't know
where she is. - Her friend Tanya's.

12:59.220 --> 13:02.380
Say she needs to sign some
bollocks, doesn't matter.

13:03.820 --> 13:06.700
Just find out what's going on.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.810
- Tina, hi. Is Adam in?
- He's upstairs.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.890
He's got his hands full at
the minute though. Well, one.

13:15.940 --> 13:19.620
- How long will he be? - I don't know.
At his age, it's difficult to say.

13:21.420 --> 13:24.170
"Collect your sample

13:24.220 --> 13:25.900
in the cup provided."

13:31.340 --> 13:33.820
We're gonna need a bigger cup.

13:39.780 --> 13:43.970
I thought, "How am I gonna allow him to
treat me like this for the rest of my life?"

13:44.020 --> 13:46.250
The lack of money is a bit of a problem.

13:46.300 --> 13:52.290
Thank you, David, for trying to
divert some of George's assets to
me but he was never gonna fall for it.

13:52.340 --> 13:53.770
I knew that, Nikki.

13:53.820 --> 13:57.610
- I don't understand. - Because the
assets are ostensibly in your name,

13:57.660 --> 14:02.210
any income and interests flows into your
account which provides quite a hefty sum.

14:02.260 --> 14:05.770
More than enough to tide you over
until any divorce settlement.

14:05.820 --> 14:09.050
- You mean I'm not destitute?
- Destitute? No.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.490
I think the word is minted.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.940
Thank you, David.

14:15.260 --> 14:17.420
For everything.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.250
Coffee?

14:23.300 --> 14:25.540
Yes, please.

14:36.260 --> 14:38.570
I can't remember how you take it.

14:38.620 --> 14:40.290
Nikki,

14:40.340 --> 14:43.250
have you been playing me all along?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.090
Sorry?

14:45.140 --> 14:50.970
You know, charming me, using me,
hoping I'd set up an escape fund
so you can run off with your lover.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.940
- What?
- George told me about Todd.

14:55.940 --> 14:57.140
Todd?

15:00.060 --> 15:03.090
I saw you stroking his
arm at the barbecue.

15:03.140 --> 15:06.340
I was trying to stop him
from grabbing my arse.

15:09.060 --> 15:12.730
"To Nikki, my love, your Toddy."

15:12.780 --> 15:14.780
That says, "Teddy."

15:15.860 --> 15:18.610
Oh, it looks... Well, who's Teddy?

15:18.660 --> 15:22.250
That was my pet name for George.
I haven't used it for years.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.730
- He sent me those flowers. - So, you didn't
leave him because of another man? - No.

15:26.780 --> 15:29.250
Well, that's not quite true.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.260
There is someone else but...

15:35.820 --> 15:39.420
I'm just not sure he feels
the same way about me.

15:43.660 --> 15:45.660
Is it...

15:46.900 --> 15:48.690
.. me?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.340
Yes.

15:58.660 --> 16:03.570
Well, not the most
satisfying wank I've ever had

16:03.620 --> 16:05.490
but I'll take it. Oh, hi, Karen.

16:05.540 --> 16:10.210
- Hello. - I was just explaining to Karen
that you're counting your sperm. - Excellent.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.890
Did you need your toes or
were your fingers enough?

16:12.940 --> 16:15.890
I presume for counting? I
don't think I'm doing it right.

16:15.940 --> 16:21.130
- You've had enough practice. - I couldn't get
a result. I might have to check with a doctor.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.410
Ah, here's one I knocked out earlier.

16:24.460 --> 16:25.770
Matthew.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.570
Hi, Karen.

16:27.620 --> 16:31.810
Hi. When I discovered your son
kissing another girl the other night

16:31.860 --> 16:36.130
and suggested that you have a word with
him about doing the right thing by Olivia,

16:36.180 --> 16:38.970
I didn't expect him to
turn around and dump her.

16:39.020 --> 16:41.330
Was that the advice you gave him?

16:41.380 --> 16:43.850
No, I told him to act responsibly.

16:43.900 --> 16:46.090
That's what I thought I was doing.

16:46.140 --> 16:50.530
- By dumping her? - I'd have been
stringing her along otherwise.

16:50.580 --> 16:54.650
I know, Matt, but she's got exams
coming up. She's stopped revising.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.850
She's just crying over her laptop.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.460
I'm worried she might electrocute herself.

17:01.860 --> 17:03.810
What do you want him to do?

17:03.860 --> 17:06.089
Get back together with her.

17:06.140 --> 17:07.369
What?

17:07.420 --> 17:11.810
- Just until the exams are over.
- That's not acting responsibly.

17:11.859 --> 17:15.730
She's been through so much recently.
She just needs our support.

17:15.780 --> 17:18.420
You could make all the difference.

17:28.060 --> 17:30.770
I think I'll just go
and have another wank.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.260
Yeah.

17:33.580 --> 17:37.140
Pete, Jen, come on. Dinner time.

17:42.260 --> 17:43.890
What's going on?

17:43.940 --> 17:46.330
Gran's taking us out for pizza.

17:46.380 --> 17:47.970
My treat.

17:48.020 --> 17:49.610
To you two.

17:49.660 --> 17:52.300
All you have to do is pour the gravy on.

17:55.260 --> 17:57.170
It's not our anniversary.

17:57.220 --> 18:01.690
She's probably thinking of her own.
Still, saves either of us having to cook.

18:01.740 --> 18:05.570
- Oh, hang on, she's right. - Married
in March. - First time round.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.090
- Then remarried...
- Today.

18:08.140 --> 18:11.730
- Ah! - I completely forgot. - It's
hard enough remembering one date.

18:11.780 --> 18:14.620
It's actually quite
sweet of the old crone.

18:16.060 --> 18:20.250
- So, how many years did we
manage first time round? - 12.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.460
And what's this anniversary?

18:24.260 --> 18:25.860
It's 12.

18:30.500 --> 18:35.490
- I might not turn up. - Jen and I
will if only to get a good look at
him. - Great, in case I want to bail.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.850
- Six o'clock, Thursday, Chapter One.
- I shall see you there.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.890
- See you. - Bye. - Bye.

18:40.940 --> 18:46.730
- What was that about? - If she'd
wanted you to know, she's have mentioned
it within your hearing. - She did.

18:46.780 --> 18:49.580
Oh, come on! She knows
about my sperm count.

18:50.860 --> 18:54.450
- She's got a blind date with a
secret admirer. - Ooh, I'm in.

18:54.500 --> 18:58.380
- You're not invited. - Six o'clock,
Thursdaym Chapter One. - Ooh!

19:06.780 --> 19:12.170
I know we've not been getting on
too well. I think having your mum
here has made things more difficult.

19:12.220 --> 19:14.650
Certainly not made them any easier.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.020
I've got the answer.

19:18.260 --> 19:20.810
Is it euthanasia?

19:24.060 --> 19:27.300
- It's a loft conversion.
- That's your answer?

19:28.300 --> 19:29.940
What was the question?

19:30.940 --> 19:35.290
I got up the other night, did some
measurements. I got off the sofa especially.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.940
Look...

19:38.060 --> 19:42.730
Stairs where the airing cupboard used to
be, window, bedroom, en-suite bathroom.

19:42.780 --> 19:45.730
Thankfully for the both
of us, she's only small.

19:45.780 --> 19:50.010
Your solution to the problem of my mum
staying is to move her in full-time?

19:50.060 --> 19:53.370
That way she won't be on
top of us, except literally.

19:53.420 --> 19:59.570
- I don't want her here at all.
- We are not sticking her in a home
against her will. That'd kill her.

19:59.620 --> 20:02.410
If she stays here any
longer, I'll do the honours.

20:03.460 --> 20:04.890
Well, that says a lot about you.

20:04.940 --> 20:07.010
I get on fine with her.

20:07.060 --> 20:09.250
She's not your mother.

20:09.300 --> 20:14.290
- Anyway, listen, we can't afford this. - That's
where you're wrong. I've been doing my sums.

20:14.340 --> 20:17.130
- Adam can still go to university.
- OK, listen.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.450
- Shut up. - And then -- - No, shut up!

20:19.500 --> 20:23.290
Your costings do not
take into account my MBA.

20:23.340 --> 20:26.290
- Your what?
- All right, my Dip Biz.

20:26.340 --> 20:30.530
Either way, this is going to help my
career. It's gonna help all of us.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.970
Work's willing to pay half of it.

20:33.020 --> 20:35.140
At least they believe in me.

20:37.140 --> 20:40.650
We are talking about the
welfare of your mother here.

20:40.700 --> 20:44.490
Maybe we should be talking about
the welfare of our marriage.

20:44.540 --> 20:47.980
Bloody loft conversion --
that'd be the death of it.

20:49.260 --> 20:51.690
I don't recognise you, Jen.

20:51.740 --> 20:54.220
You're not the woman I married.

20:55.260 --> 20:57.420
On either occasion.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.310
Toner.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.230
No, no, no, no.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.150
- This is not a good idea.
- What?

21:28.200 --> 21:32.640
- You and me in a confined space.
- Why? Are you claustrophobic?

21:33.640 --> 21:36.070
Or worried about what we might do?

21:36.120 --> 21:37.990
Sarah,

21:38.040 --> 21:40.830
I'm terrified about what we might do.

21:40.880 --> 21:44.030
- I want you to undress me again.
- I can't.

21:44.080 --> 21:48.560
- Not here? - Not anywhere. - Tell
me you haven't thought about it.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.280
You have, haven't you?

21:58.600 --> 22:02.840
- Sarah, we can't.
- Adam, we can't not.

22:05.360 --> 22:10.550
Wait, I don't want to do it amongst
photocopying paper and toner.

22:10.600 --> 22:15.110
- Toner -- yes. That's what I came in for.
- Come round to mine this evening after work.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.640
No.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.320
I'll be expecting you.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.990
- Hiya.
- Sorry.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.830
Held up at work.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.510
So, Karen here yet? Eh?

22:40.560 --> 22:41.710
Ooh!

22:41.760 --> 22:46.150
- Hi! - Jen, we're supposed to be pretending
we don't know her. - Oh, yeah, sorry.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.390
- She'll let us know if
she wants rescuing. - How?

22:49.440 --> 22:52.830
- Have you got a safe word or something?
- How's that gonna work?

22:52.880 --> 22:54.350
Don't know.

22:54.400 --> 22:58.630
- She could, like, scream,
"Help me!" - Don't.

22:58.680 --> 23:02.470
No. She's gonna pretend that
she's got a work call to make.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.110
- That's our signal to swing by the table.
- OK, all right.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.200
Oh, is that him?

23:09.600 --> 23:11.950
Surely not.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.880
Well, at our age, beggars
can't be choosers.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.280
Nah.

23:22.400 --> 23:26.080
- So, Adam coming? - Yeah, said
he wouldn't miss it for the world.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.120
Ooh, not bad! Is that him?

23:53.080 --> 23:57.390
Oh! Hey, psst! Is that him?

23:57.440 --> 23:59.240
Hi.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.910
Oh, my God, that's him!

24:02.960 --> 24:05.200
Oh, he's a looker.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.000
I tell you if Karen
doesn't want him, I will.

24:11.400 --> 24:15.670
- I'm so sorry I'm late. - Five minutes.
Six and I would have been out of here.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.280
I'm glad I ran those
last couple of blocks.

24:21.680 --> 24:24.640
Don't do it, Adam. Don't
get out of this car.

24:25.640 --> 24:26.990
Oh, fuck off.

24:27.040 --> 24:31.630
- You and Tina are trying for a baby. - You
don't need to remind me. - Well, apparently I
do.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.950
- I feel alive! - If you go into that
house, you will never see me again.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.190
- That's reason enough. - Because
you will no longer have a conscience.
Is that the man you want to be?

24:41.240 --> 24:44.030
One who goes skulking around,
has two mobile phones?

24:44.080 --> 24:48.030
You won't be able to look Tina in
the eye again. And all for what?

24:48.080 --> 24:53.910
Uninhibited steamy sex with a super-fit
lovely Irish girl who demands nothing of you?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.990
Goodbye.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.670
- OK, I phrased that badly.
- Leave me alone. I'm doing this.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.680
- No, you're not. - I am. - You're not!

25:12.480 --> 25:14.270
Good lad.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.880
Wanker.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.630
You're the publisher? That explains it.

25:20.680 --> 25:24.070
- My passionate book review?
- You were rearranging the shelves.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.510
- Oh... - I was a little
worried you might be mad.

25:27.560 --> 25:31.390
- Doesn't mean I'm not.
- I see no further evidence.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.830
- So, what is it you do?
- Builder.

25:33.880 --> 25:39.270
- Oh, have you got your own company?
- Why would you think that? - Cos
you read serious literature.

25:39.320 --> 25:43.910
I am so sorry. That is a terrible
thing to say. I'm so sorry.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.070
I'm just a builder, a chippy.
Do I lose points for that?

25:47.120 --> 25:49.190
No, no, no, not at all. The opposite.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.390
A man with intelligence
who's good with his hands.

25:54.440 --> 25:57.190
Sorry, it's my daughter.
Do you mind if I get this?

25:57.240 --> 26:02.870
So the boys' 50th, I've
narrowed it down to three places.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.910
That's my favourite.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.830
Yeah, that looks great. Shall we book it?

26:07.880 --> 26:09.550
Oh, already have.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.910
- Oh, my God, Karen's set
the flare off. - What?

26:12.960 --> 26:15.280
No, wait, Jen, she hasn't called us.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.720
No, no, no, OK.

26:22.800 --> 26:27.070
All right, darling, bye. She's
patched things up with her boyfriend.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.200
That's nice.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.550
- He didn't notice. - Hi. - Think
I got away with it. Hi. - Mwah.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.550
Oh, so, is that him?

26:36.600 --> 26:40.800
- Sit down. We're trying to be subtle.
- Not all together successfully.

26:43.280 --> 26:47.080
- Shall we go somewhere else?
- Wouldn't you like to join your friends?

26:50.880 --> 26:56.470
- A very sensible precaution. - When did you
rumble them? - The thumbs up when I entered.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.910
Look at that.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.910
- So, this is it?
- Yeah.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.000
- Jen's already booked it.
- Looks nice, pricey.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.480
Bye.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.030
- I've missed the show.
- Where were you anyway?

27:21.080 --> 27:23.910
Oh, traffic on the Mancunian Way.

27:23.960 --> 27:26.360
That's the excuse I always use.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.110
I'm just gonna finish this chapter.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.960
I'm just gonna start the next chapter.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.280
It's only gonna take me
longer if you do that.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.670
Is this because you're turning 50?

27:53.720 --> 27:55.110
What?

27:55.160 --> 27:58.750
All this attention you've been
giving me the last couple of nights.

27:58.800 --> 28:02.750
- Or is it a sign of a guilty conscience?
- Such a cliche.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.990
- You know what they say about cliches.
- It's neither.

28:06.040 --> 28:10.480
It's just you're a very... desirable...

28:12.000 --> 28:13.600
.. woman.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.920
Who is never gonna finish this book.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.750
Oh, sod it.

28:28.400 --> 28:32.840
Karen, could I ask you
for a piece of advice?

28:33.840 --> 28:36.630
- It's about affairs
of the heart. - Ooh.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.910
Now you've got my attention.

28:38.960 --> 28:42.630
I've met someone. At least I think I have.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.830
What, you can't tell?

28:44.880 --> 28:47.030
No, no, I have.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.990
We're very different.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.950
She's married.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.630
- Well, that is different.
- Adam tells me that you're seeing someone too.

28:56.680 --> 29:00.230
Yeah, yeah, well, we've
been out for dinner... once.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.080
So have we.

29:03.600 --> 29:07.190
After passing my A'levels,
I went to university.

29:07.240 --> 29:10.990
After I failed my O'Levels,
I went to work at Boots.

29:11.040 --> 29:14.950
I was 33 when we got married.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.230
We divorced seven years later.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.600
I was 23. We lasted 12
years. Similar outcome.

29:23.320 --> 29:28.470
- No, you went to the same restaurant?
- He asked me where I wanted to go.

29:28.520 --> 29:32.470
Ah, it was one of our favourites.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.000
Yeah.

29:35.520 --> 29:40.110
- Are you worried that George might
have had us followed? - Yeah, a little.

29:40.160 --> 29:43.390
That's why I drove around
the block a few times.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.320
I thought you were looking
for a parking space.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.430
What are you going to say to George?

29:49.480 --> 29:53.680
Well, that rather depends on how
the rest of this dinner goes.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.830
So, how did it go?

29:58.880 --> 30:01.680
Well,... I like her.

30:02.680 --> 30:06.430
And... she seems to like me.

30:06.480 --> 30:10.480
Well, David, there is a lot to like.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.080
Not enough obviously.

30:16.920 --> 30:21.030
I've invited her to Adam and Pete's
50th. I hope that's all right.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.790
- Got nothing to do with me.
- Only if you're sure it's OK.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.830
Pete and Adam say it's fine.

30:26.880 --> 30:30.790
A chance to get to know each other
without looking over our shoulders.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.190
Oh, God, I'll be the only one on my own.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.280
- Honestly, I can put her off
if you'd rather. - No, no.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.200
Has she already agreed to come?

30:51.100 --> 30:54.300
Jenny's been delayed, had
to make another pit stop.

30:55.900 --> 30:57.340
Thank you.

31:04.840 --> 31:08.420
I shouldn't have had that cup of
tea, went straight through me.

31:09.460 --> 31:14.540
We've got another 20 miles. Do you
think you can last that long, Mum?

31:15.540 --> 31:18.460
I'll just see if I can
squeeze a bit more out.

31:21.340 --> 31:23.410
We couldn't just leave her at home.

31:23.460 --> 31:26.860
I'd drive her back myself except
I'd have to stop five times.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.410
Get in, son.

31:33.460 --> 31:37.170
No, I didn't ask for a twin
room. I asked for two rooms.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.770
A twin room is not available.

31:38.820 --> 31:43.370
You don't understand. A double
room is fine. I just need two.

31:43.420 --> 31:45.250
One double room is all I can offer.

31:45.300 --> 31:49.410
- David, a double is fine.
- Can't you at least offer a twin?

31:49.460 --> 31:53.130
- There is a twin in the name of Marsden.
- Oh, that's me.

31:53.180 --> 31:56.450
- Mrs Karen Marsden?
- No, that's my ex-wife.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.450
Tell you what, swap us
over. She's on her own.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.090
- David, hi.
- Karen.

32:02.140 --> 32:04.770
- This is Gareth, a late
addition. David. - Hi.

32:04.820 --> 32:06.530
- David's the girls' father.
- Oh.

32:06.580 --> 32:08.810
This is Nikki.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.970
- Nikki, hi. Karen.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

32:12.020 --> 32:15.660
On second thoughts, we'll have
the double. They'll have the twin.

32:16.780 --> 32:22.010
It's a travel journal for you to write down all
the memories of the trips we'll take together.

32:22.060 --> 32:26.850
- I take it you're in for the long haul?
- That's sort of what I wanted to say, yeah.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.370
Thank you. It's beautiful.

32:29.420 --> 32:34.060
And the gesture as well,
really. Where will we go first?

32:35.060 --> 32:38.100
Well, that's the second
part of your present.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.660
Thank you.

32:42.500 --> 32:46.770
"Holidays for the
over-50s." How very droll!

32:46.820 --> 32:51.610
- You'll have to go alone. I'm not eligible.
- You'd only cramp my style.

32:51.660 --> 32:54.020
Or if you'd prefer, there is this.

32:57.660 --> 32:59.970
No... South America?

33:00.020 --> 33:04.450
Yeah. We leave next month for two
weeks. I've cleared it with your work.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.730
Oh!

33:05.780 --> 33:10.290
- Machu Picchu?
- Yeah. You said you always wanted to go.

33:10.340 --> 33:16.130
I figured we should do it sooner
because, in the future, we might be
limited to places with a kids' club.

33:16.180 --> 33:18.540
Speaking of which...

33:19.700 --> 33:22.940
Do you think we've got time before dinner?

33:24.900 --> 33:27.410
As long as we go straight
for the main course!

33:27.460 --> 33:29.490
You just enjoy your sleepover.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.530
We'll celebrate my
birthday on the actual day.

33:32.580 --> 33:35.610
Yeah, course I'll tell
her. All right, yeah.

33:35.660 --> 33:37.650
Lots of love. See you. Bye.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.690
Chloe sends big hugs.

33:39.740 --> 33:43.210
- Oh, God love her.
- Bloody hell!

33:43.260 --> 33:46.570
- How much did that cost?
- Is that the first thing you can say?

33:46.620 --> 33:50.050
No, you look lovely. I just
wondered how much it cost.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.370
- I bought it with my money.
- Your money?

33:52.420 --> 33:56.890
- Yeah, my wages. - It was never my
money when I was bringing in more.

33:56.940 --> 33:59.130
God, that feels like a long time ago.

33:59.980 --> 34:02.410
- Can you get changed, please?
- I am changed.

34:02.460 --> 34:06.170
- You're not wearing that.
- It's my birthday. I can wear what I want.

34:06.220 --> 34:10.409
We look like the lady
and the bloody tramp!

34:10.460 --> 34:14.620
I'm comfortable in what I'm
wearing. I'm not changing.

34:21.340 --> 34:24.570
I think we might have finally
hit the jackpot there.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.659
- You set the bells ringing.
- I know.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.940
Very nice to meet you.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.690
Shall we sit down?

34:43.739 --> 34:45.900
Come on.

35:00.700 --> 35:03.850
- Are you all right?
- Hello.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.730
- Hi. - Gareth. - Gary?

35:05.780 --> 35:06.940
Hi.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.090
I'll just be a minute.

35:10.140 --> 35:12.340
Oh, OK. Wha...

35:15.900 --> 35:17.420
Sarah?

35:19.100 --> 35:21.810
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.

35:21.860 --> 35:25.010
- How did you know where I was?
- You left your emails open.

35:25.060 --> 35:26.650
Jesus!

35:26.700 --> 35:30.570
- We need to talk. I need to talk.
- We will. Next week.

35:30.620 --> 35:33.820
No, now. I need to tell you everything.

35:35.820 --> 35:38.020
Everything? What is there?

35:39.020 --> 35:41.050
Here, go up to my room.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.890
Go.

35:42.940 --> 35:46.700
It's the first floor, the
first suite on the right.

35:49.700 --> 35:51.010
Shit.

35:51.060 --> 35:53.530
I'm having the asparagus.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.570
Sorry about that.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.170
Where's Tina?

35:57.220 --> 35:59.650
- She went to look for you.
- Shit.

35:59.700 --> 36:03.450
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yeah, erm, it's just something I ate.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.780
- We haven't ordered yet.
- Earlier.

36:06.780 --> 36:09.050
- Where were you?
- At the loo.

36:09.100 --> 36:13.690
- Can I borrow your room key?
- Where's yours? - I left it inside.

36:13.740 --> 36:17.250
Something's not right down there. Thanks.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.340
Please start without me.

36:21.260 --> 36:23.860
He's worse than you, Mum!

36:25.500 --> 36:28.180
- She's incontinent.
- Jenny!

36:35.620 --> 36:37.020
Jesus!

36:43.820 --> 36:48.730
I'm working on a conservatory at the moment
but I'll do anything. No job too small.

36:48.780 --> 36:53.210
- Oh, do you do loft conversions?
- We're not getting a loft conversion.

36:53.260 --> 36:55.010
Extra bedroom. Added value.

36:55.060 --> 36:59.180
- We don't need one.
- It's for Barbara. - Oh!

37:00.500 --> 37:04.530
- I don't want to be any trouble.
- Too late for that.

37:04.580 --> 37:08.810
- No harm in Gareth having a look.
- Most of your neighbours have had one done.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.810
I'm happy to give you
a quote. No obligation.

37:11.860 --> 37:15.890
We're not getting a loft conversion, OK?

37:15.940 --> 37:17.250
Why not?

37:17.300 --> 37:22.860
Because I don't even know if I want to
live under the same roof as you any more.

37:24.340 --> 37:26.570
Sorry!

37:26.620 --> 37:28.700
- Jen...
- Sorry, everyone.

37:37.940 --> 37:40.490
I contrived it all, Adam,
to get you into bed.

37:40.540 --> 37:45.130
Are you saying that all of this
was part of some grand scheme?

37:45.180 --> 37:46.620
Yes.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.370
From even before you
started work at our firm.

37:50.420 --> 37:54.090
- In fact, it was me who recommended you.
- But you didn't know me.

37:54.140 --> 37:57.900
I knew who you were -- Tina's boyfriend.

37:58.900 --> 38:01.130
That's why I put your name forward.

38:01.180 --> 38:05.660
I couldn't be sure you'd get the
job. Fortunately for me, you did.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.650
Which is when I moved to stage two.

38:09.700 --> 38:13.210
Of the plan to get even with Tina?

38:13.260 --> 38:15.490
She destroyed my happiness.

38:15.540 --> 38:18.330
I was determined to do the same to her.

38:18.380 --> 38:23.370
- By seducing me? - What spurred me on
was the thought of the look on her face

38:23.420 --> 38:28.810
- when she discovered the man she trusted had
betrayed her with Jamie's wife. - Jesus Christ!

38:28.860 --> 38:31.130
I hated her, Adam.

38:31.180 --> 38:33.650
I meant to get at her through you.

38:33.700 --> 38:38.580
- I came here to tell her everything.
- So, why are you telling me?

38:40.900 --> 38:43.010
Because I can't do it.

38:43.060 --> 38:48.290
I thought that I was controlling
events, but it's the other way around.

38:48.340 --> 38:54.020
What I hadn't anticipated for was...
I would fall in love with you.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.170
I love you, Adam.

39:01.220 --> 39:05.210
As much as I would like to hurt
her, I can't do that to you.

39:06.820 --> 39:11.210
'Adam, are you there? I need
to talk to you. It's important.'

39:11.260 --> 39:15.970
Erm, Jen, yeah. I'll be
down in a couple of minutes.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.690
'Are you all right?'

39:17.740 --> 39:20.580
Yeah, I'm just cleaning up
here. I'll see you soon.

39:21.580 --> 39:23.650
I'll go.

39:23.700 --> 39:26.650
Er, no, no. I need to
get my head round this.

39:26.700 --> 39:30.170
- Your friends will miss you.
- But there's more to be said.

39:30.220 --> 39:33.540
I've got my car outside.
We can talk there.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.780
OK, as soon as I can slip away.

39:41.060 --> 39:42.700
Oh...

39:46.300 --> 39:49.050
I'm guessing this isn't
what it looks like.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.250
It's exactly what it looks like.

39:51.300 --> 39:55.620
Jen, I have screwed up more than
I have ever screwed up before.

39:58.100 --> 40:02.930
- Mum, how could you? - Liv? - Matt only got
back together with me because you ordered him to.

40:02.980 --> 40:05.770
- What? - Have you any
idea how insulting that is?

40:05.820 --> 40:09.210
Why would he tell you that? Liv?

40:09.260 --> 40:10.730
Liv! Liv, wait.

40:10.780 --> 40:13.500
I need the little girl's room.

40:15.660 --> 40:18.190
Are nights out with your
friends always this wild?

40:19.740 --> 40:23.290
Oh, Adam, you've got to
get rid of the mad bitch!

40:23.340 --> 40:27.740
She's not a bitch. She wanted
to be but it's just not in her.

40:28.740 --> 40:30.570
Oh, my God!

40:30.620 --> 40:32.490
You've fallen for her.

40:32.540 --> 40:35.300
That's Stockholm Syndrome, that is.

40:36.340 --> 40:38.770
- Have you been crying?
- Hm?

40:38.820 --> 40:41.610
Oh... It's nothing.

40:41.660 --> 40:44.980
I just told Pete our marriage is over.

40:49.940 --> 40:53.170
- Oh, God, she's in tears.
- Why did you interfere like that?

40:53.220 --> 40:56.010
I'm so sorry. I thought I
was doing the right thing.

40:56.860 --> 40:58.400
Where the hell is Adam?

41:02.100 --> 41:03.660
Mains?

41:04.700 --> 41:06.700
Who ordered the sea bass?

41:09.060 --> 41:14.010
I don't know, Adam. We
want different things.

41:14.060 --> 41:17.410
He wants to watch Dragons'
Den. I want to be on it.

41:17.460 --> 41:23.330
You've had your ups and downs before -- your
divorce, Pete's depression. You got over them.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.370
This is different.

41:25.420 --> 41:30.050
I don't know if I want to spend
the next 25 years with him.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.090
You can't split up.

41:32.140 --> 41:36.130
Rachel's gone. Karen and David are
divorced. You're the last pair standing.

41:36.180 --> 41:39.890
If you two go your separate ways,
the whole group will fall apart.

41:39.940 --> 41:44.130
Well, if we're all that's holding
it together, maybe it should.

41:44.180 --> 41:46.050
Don't say that, Jen.

41:46.100 --> 41:47.690
Seriously!

41:47.740 --> 41:51.530
I mean, look, maybe
friendships, like marriages,

41:51.580 --> 41:53.900
they've got their shelf life.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.890
We have all reached our sell-by date.

41:57.940 --> 41:59.530
Not us.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.970
We've been friends for over 20 years.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.860
We're here to celebrate
my and Pete's 50th.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.100
Happy fucking birthday.

42:13.740 --> 42:15.130
Where is everyone?

42:15.180 --> 42:17.130
Tina's gone to look for you.

42:17.180 --> 42:20.450
Karen and David are with Olivia.

42:20.500 --> 42:24.690
Pete's gone to get a breath of fresh
air and Barbara's gone to the loo.

42:24.740 --> 42:25.850
Ah.

42:25.900 --> 42:27.650
We're having a lovely time.

42:27.700 --> 42:29.930
Oh, God, there you are.

42:29.980 --> 42:32.170
- Hey.
- Adam, what's going on?

42:32.220 --> 42:35.890
Oh, nothing, nothing. Let's
sit down and finish our meals.

42:35.940 --> 42:38.770
Or, in my case, start.

42:38.820 --> 42:40.610
Hi.

42:40.660 --> 42:43.890
Well, your son's really done it this time.

42:43.940 --> 42:47.930
Look, can we just all
please try and get on?

42:47.980 --> 42:49.380
I doubt it.

42:50.860 --> 42:55.250
- I can't wait for the argument when we
split the bill. - I have a calculator.
