little forever.

Reese finally found a way

01:12.990 --> 01:15.367
to beat the snot out of people

01:15.409 --> 01:17.411
and actually get

01:15.409 --> 01:17.411
a trophy for it.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.038
When's Reese up?

01:17.452 --> 01:19.038
I think he's next.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.039
Ooh!

01:20.080 --> 01:23.042
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yee-hee!

01:23.083 --> 01:24.626
You're Reese's parents?

01:24.668 --> 01:26.795
Why?

01:26.837 --> 01:28.505
He's incredible.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.505
I was at the last meet.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.049
His match was

01:28.547 --> 01:30.049
the turning point.

01:30.089 --> 01:31.341
He inspired the whole team.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.135
And?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.596
Nothing.

01:35.637 --> 01:36.597
He's great.

01:36.638 --> 01:40.141
Thank... you.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.143
We're still getting

01:40.183 --> 01:42.143
used to this whole

01:42.185 --> 01:43.562
being proud of Reese thing.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.397
Go team!

01:45.439 --> 01:47.148
Thank you, Braveheart.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.525
(laughter)

01:48.567 --> 01:51.194
Where's Reese?

01:48.567 --> 01:51.194
Shouldn't he be warming up?

01:51.236 --> 01:53.030
(giggling)

01:51.236 --> 01:53.030
(whistles)

01:53.072 --> 01:54.656
Reese! You're up next.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.157
Let's go.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.827
(cheers and applause)

01:58.869 --> 02:00.537
Go, Reese.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.914
All right, who's up?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.128
Uh-oh.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.882
Well, that's not fair.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.258
What do they expect

02:11.924 --> 02:13.258
him to do--

02:13.300 --> 02:14.217
beat up a girl?

02:14.259 --> 02:16.177
I get to beat up a girl.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.512
Cool.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.182
(whistle blows)

02:21.224 --> 02:22.643
(whooping)

02:22.684 --> 02:23.852
Go, Reese!

02:23.894 --> 02:26.187
(Reese laughs)

02:28.231 --> 02:29.190
(yells)

02:29.232 --> 02:30.943
(grunting)

02:32.235 --> 02:33.153
Two points.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.157
One point.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.621
(grunting)

02:44.247 --> 02:45.916
Two points.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.170
(crowd booing)

02:52.673 --> 02:53.590
Come on, Reese!

02:53.632 --> 02:54.508
Let's go, son!

02:54.549 --> 02:56.384
Kill her!

02:59.262 --> 03:00.097
(whistle sounds)

03:00.139 --> 03:01.473
REFEREE:

03:00.139 --> 03:01.473
Warning.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.808
(whistle blows)

03:02.850 --> 03:03.892
Come on, ref!

03:03.934 --> 03:05.060
Stop! Warning!

03:05.102 --> 03:07.228
Kill him!

03:07.270 --> 03:11.232
(whistle blowing)

03:11.274 --> 03:12.484
Aah!

03:12.526 --> 03:14.277
(crowd groaning)

03:14.319 --> 03:16.237
Ow! Aah!

03:16.279 --> 03:18.949
Ow! Ow!

03:18.991 --> 03:20.701
(cheers and applause)

03:20.742 --> 03:21.743
Ow!

03:22.744 --> 03:27.206
(cheers and applause)

03:46.185 --> 03:48.228
Is Reese a girl now?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.313
No, Dewey. He's a lady.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.857
Shut up!

03:51.899 --> 03:52.941
Sorry, ma'am.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.151
All right, that's enough.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.861
Reese lost a wrestling match.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.779
It's no big deal--

03:55.903 --> 03:57.779
sometimes you win,

03:57.821 --> 03:59.198
sometimes you don't.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.490
Yeah, son, you have

03:59.239 --> 04:00.490
nothing to be ashamed of.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.283
You did your best.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.953
That girl was just inarguably

04:02.325 --> 04:04.953
a better wrestler than you.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.288
Oh, my God, she had you

04:04.995 --> 04:07.288
flopping around on that mat

04:07.330 --> 04:08.749
like a rag doll.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.792
(phone rings)

04:13.170 --> 04:14.295
Hello.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.296
Hold him down!

04:15.338 --> 04:17.298
You, shave his butt.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.760
Mom, I'm calling to remind you

04:17.340 --> 04:19.760
that today is the last day

04:19.801 --> 04:21.511
to buy me a plane ticket home

04:19.801 --> 04:21.511
for my...

04:21.553 --> 04:23.097
(whispering):

04:21.553 --> 04:23.097
birthday.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.806
Honey, we talked about this.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.307
We can't fly you back here

04:24.848 --> 04:26.307
in the middle of the week.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.726
You'd only be here

04:26.349 --> 04:27.726
for eight hours.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.727
But, Mom...

04:27.768 --> 04:28.727
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.104
I wish things were different,

04:30.145 --> 04:31.312
but you were just home

04:30.145 --> 04:31.312
for Thanksgiving,

04:31.354 --> 04:33.148
and that's all

04:31.354 --> 04:33.148
we can afford right now.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.567
Mom, you don't know what they do

04:33.190 --> 04:35.567
to people around here on their

04:35.609 --> 04:36.735
(whispering):

04:35.609 --> 04:36.735
birthday.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.237
They strip you naked,

04:38.278 --> 04:39.905
and they shave every hair

04:38.278 --> 04:39.905
off your body

04:39.947 --> 04:41.740
and they throw you

04:39.947 --> 04:41.740
in the reflecting pond.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.158
Is that what you want for me?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.785
I'm impressed, Francis.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.703
Your stories are getting better;

04:44.826 --> 04:46.703
at least more believable.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.205
What stories?

04:48.247 --> 04:49.998
Oh, when you wanted to come home

04:48.247 --> 04:49.998
for that party

04:50.040 --> 04:51.750
and you swore the academy

04:50.040 --> 04:51.750
was being terrorized

04:51.792 --> 04:52.751
by a pack of feral dogs?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.962
Which were never caught.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.922
Francis, I want you home

04:55.003 --> 04:56.922
for your birthday, too,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.007
but we just can't afford it.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.342
Fine. I guess I'll just

04:59.049 --> 05:01.342
fend for myself

05:01.384 --> 05:03.804
and hope these monsters

05:01.384 --> 05:03.804
don't find out it's my...

05:03.845 --> 05:05.222
(whispering):

05:03.845 --> 05:05.222
you know.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.348
(cadet screaming)

05:07.390 --> 05:09.810
He's still got an eyebrow!

05:09.851 --> 05:11.311
Get him!

05:15.065 --> 05:16.275
Hey, Malcolm.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.359
I heard about your brother

05:16.316 --> 05:18.359
last night.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.527
It was hilarious.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.612
You didn't see it?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.364
A sporting... event?

05:23.406 --> 05:24.950
Right. I wonder

05:23.406 --> 05:24.950
what it's like

05:24.992 --> 05:26.534
to get beat up

05:24.992 --> 05:26.534
by a girl.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.369
It's totally humiliating.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.830
You just want to die.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.748
Your brother didn't

05:29.871 --> 05:31.748
soil himself, did he?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.792
No.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.210
Neither did I.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.377
You know...

05:36.419 --> 05:38.297
Reese's embarrassing

05:36.419 --> 05:38.297
defeat could have

05:38.337 --> 05:39.631
serious consequences

05:38.337 --> 05:39.631
for us all.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.466
He'll be working

05:39.673 --> 05:41.466
extra hard

05:41.508 --> 05:43.384
to prove he's still on top

05:41.508 --> 05:43.384
of the food chain.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.553
You're saying we could

05:43.426 --> 05:45.553
actually have a meaner,

05:45.595 --> 05:47.388
more vicious Reese on our hands?

05:47.430 --> 05:48.389
It's very possible.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.683
We can't avoid

05:48.431 --> 05:49.683
the beatings,

05:49.724 --> 05:51.768
but I suggest that,

05:49.724 --> 05:51.768
as a wedgie deterrent,

05:51.810 --> 05:53.895
we go without underwear

05:51.810 --> 05:53.895
for the next several days.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.438
Uh-oh.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.815
Here he comes now.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.360
(silverware

05:59.358 --> 06:01.360
and plate clattering)

06:07.450 --> 06:10.369
This is the first time

06:07.450 --> 06:10.369
I've ever been happy to be me.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.377
You want something

06:16.459 --> 06:18.377
to look at?

06:21.380 --> 06:23.382
I'll give you something

06:21.380 --> 06:23.382
to look at.

06:24.383 --> 06:25.635
(screaming)

06:38.481 --> 06:40.817
The old

06:38.481 --> 06:40.817
chocolate milk diversion.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.652
Wish I had thought of that.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.449
Okay, what the hell was that

06:45.864 --> 06:48.449
milk thing on the playground?

06:48.491 --> 06:50.077
I don't know.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.077
I had to do something.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.079
So you poured milk on yourself?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.373
Why didn't you

06:52.120 --> 06:54.373
just pound that kid?

06:54.413 --> 06:55.540
Because I'm sick of doing that.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.458
I'm sick of beating up

06:55.582 --> 06:57.458
little kids.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.044
It's creepy.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.837
But that's you--

06:59.086 --> 07:00.837
that's what you do.

07:00.879 --> 07:01.838
Not anymore.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.298
That was the old me.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.465
The thing I did

07:03.340 --> 07:04.465
at school today

07:04.507 --> 07:06.509
was me destroying the old Reese.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.678
So, drenching yourself

07:06.551 --> 07:08.678
with chocolate milk

07:08.720 --> 07:10.471
was like a baptism?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.099
No, idiot.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.975
I was washing away

07:12.140 --> 07:13.975
the old me and starting over.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.769
You know, you've been acting

07:14.017 --> 07:15.769
really weird

07:15.810 --> 07:18.188
ever since you got your butt

07:15.810 --> 07:18.188
kicked by that girl.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.564
It's not just about the girl.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.858
Wrestling made me

07:19.606 --> 07:21.858
feel good, you know?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.484
I was helping the school.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.320
People looked up to me.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.406
And that's gone now,

07:25.362 --> 07:27.406
and I've got nothing.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.490
But it's not going

07:27.447 --> 07:29.490
to be like that anymore.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.493
I'm going to find a way to make

07:29.532 --> 07:32.493
people proud of me again.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.121
So what are you going to do?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.289
I don't know.

07:35.330 --> 07:37.374
I just want to be

07:35.330 --> 07:37.374
the good guy,

07:37.416 --> 07:38.959
do good stuff...

07:39.000 --> 07:41.128
for good.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.754
Dewey, what can I

07:41.169 --> 07:42.754
do for you?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.298
Mom!

07:42.796 --> 07:44.298
Shut up!

07:44.339 --> 07:46.216
I'm trying to help you.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.216
(grunting)

07:49.261 --> 07:51.763
Hi, sweetie.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.181
What's wrong?

07:53.223 --> 07:54.599
Is it Francis?

07:54.641 --> 07:56.517
Yeah.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.894
He keeps calling.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.520
His stupid stories are

07:57.936 --> 07:59.520
touching, in a way.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.440
You know, he just

07:59.562 --> 08:01.440
wants to come home.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.900
It's the first time he's

08:01.481 --> 08:03.900
been away on his birthday.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.986
Well, maybe we can at least

08:03.942 --> 08:05.986
do something that night

08:06.027 --> 08:07.528
to take our minds off it.

08:07.570 --> 08:11.532
A guy at work won these

08:07.570 --> 08:11.532
concert tickets on the radio.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.742
Jimmy Buffett?

08:12.784 --> 08:14.911
He didn't want them.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.911
Can you imagine?

08:14.953 --> 08:17.038
(phone ringing)

08:17.080 --> 08:19.040
Hello.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.751
Mom, great news. I figured out

08:19.082 --> 08:21.751
a way to get home Wednesday.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.794
Francis...

08:22.836 --> 08:24.463
No, it won't cost you a cent.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.173
One of the cadet's fathers

08:24.504 --> 08:26.173
is a trucker.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.258
He said I can ride

08:26.214 --> 08:28.258
in the refrigerator compartment

08:28.300 --> 08:30.718
to the 609 interchange.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.718
And a buddy of his

08:30.760 --> 08:32.387
flies a crop duster.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.387
Now, if he's sober,

08:32.429 --> 08:34.555
he should be able to drop me off

08:32.429 --> 08:34.555
at the soybean field

08:34.597 --> 08:35.556
near the train station...

08:35.598 --> 08:36.850
Honey, Francis, come on.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.435
There'll be other birthdays.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.146
Ask him if he wants a T-shirt

08:38.477 --> 08:41.146
from the concert.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.147
What concert?

08:42.189 --> 08:43.564
Uh, your father

08:43.606 --> 08:44.858
got us tickets

08:43.606 --> 08:44.858
to see Jimmy Buffett.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.485
And this concert wouldn't happen

08:46.526 --> 08:48.028
to be on Wednesday night,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.028
would it?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.570
My birthday?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.572
Uh, yes, it is,

08:49.612 --> 08:51.572
but that has nothing to do...

08:51.614 --> 08:52.991
Oh, now I get it.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.451
You can't afford

08:53.033 --> 08:54.451
to bring me home, but somehow

08:54.493 --> 08:55.952
you find money

08:54.493 --> 08:55.952
for Jimmy Buffett tickets.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.497
Francis, that's not

08:55.994 --> 08:58.497
the way it is at all.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.165
They were free tickets.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.165
Sure they were.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.875
A friend of your father's

09:00.207 --> 09:01.875
gave them to us.

09:01.916 --> 09:02.959
He's not really a friend.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.627
You know, you guys should really

09:04.669 --> 09:07.755
get your stories straight before

09:04.669 --> 09:07.755
you try to ditch me on my...

09:07.797 --> 09:09.132
(whispering):

09:07.797 --> 09:09.132
birthday.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.181
Hey, Malcolm.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.599
Want my cake?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.599
You're not hungry?

09:18.641 --> 09:21.602
No. I ate my lunch

09:18.641 --> 09:21.602
and  my decoy lunch.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.231
Now that Reese isn't

09:21.644 --> 09:24.231
stealing it anymore, I get both.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.774
And Reese hasn't made me

09:24.272 --> 09:26.774
eat grass for a week.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.609
Everything tastes better.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.530
Life... is good.

09:31.571 --> 09:35.867
I've been taking ballet,

09:31.571 --> 09:35.867
and I don't care who knows it.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.285
Good for you.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.498
Two days ago,

09:38.828 --> 09:41.498
Reese would've creamed that kid.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.916
Things are really changing.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.626
It's like we've entered

09:42.957 --> 09:45.626
an age of enlightenment.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.295
It's kind of nice.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.922
Hey!

09:48.963 --> 09:50.507
Hey.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.509
What was that for?

09:52.551 --> 09:53.634
That's for having

09:52.551 --> 09:53.634
a smart mouth

09:53.676 --> 09:55.095
and making fun of me

09:53.676 --> 09:55.095
all the time.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.472
Since Reese

09:55.136 --> 09:57.472
is out of the picture,

09:57.514 --> 09:59.057
I don't have to take it anymore.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.517
What are you talking about?

10:00.559 --> 10:02.018
Now that your brother's a wuss,

10:02.060 --> 10:04.645
I don't have to worry

10:02.060 --> 10:04.645
about him coming after me

10:04.687 --> 10:05.939
when I teach you a lesson.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.065
But we're friends.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.025
Making cracks about me

10:07.107 --> 10:09.025
painting my face

10:09.067 --> 10:10.110
and being stupid?

10:10.151 --> 10:11.736
You say those things

10:10.151 --> 10:11.736
to  friends?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.654
Those things were funny.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.655
Oh, yeah. Real funny.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.074
I'll show you what's funny.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.867
Knock, knock. Who's there?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.661
Pushy Pusherson.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.623
What's wrong with him?

10:24.583 --> 10:25.666
(grunts)

10:25.708 --> 10:28.086
Remember me? Moby Rick?

10:28.128 --> 10:29.921
That was so hilarious.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.590
I never called you Moby Rick.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.924
I called you Rick-Oppotamus.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.674
Although...

10:33.716 --> 10:35.051
(grunting)

10:35.093 --> 10:36.344
Hey! Hey!

10:36.386 --> 10:37.429
Just wait for a second.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.183
So you guys really

10:39.806 --> 10:42.183
don't think I'm funny?

10:47.439 --> 10:49.649
Well, you learn something new

10:47.439 --> 10:49.649
every day.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.488
Evidently, I'm not as charming

10:52.110 --> 10:54.488
as I thought.

10:54.529 --> 10:55.696
(groans)

10:55.738 --> 10:57.698
You know, you really

10:55.738 --> 10:57.698
make us feel bad

10:57.740 --> 10:59.493
with your hurtful

10:57.740 --> 10:59.493
comments.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.493
Yeah.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.536
You know I'm insecure

10:59.534 --> 11:01.536
about my taste in clothes,

11:01.578 --> 11:03.913
yet you continue to make cutting

11:01.578 --> 11:03.913
remarks about my outfits.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.332
Yeah!

11:05.373 --> 11:07.334
You walk around acting

11:05.373 --> 11:07.334
all smart and funny,

11:07.375 --> 11:10.504
but did you know I cry

11:07.375 --> 11:10.504
myself to sleep every night?

11:10.545 --> 11:13.632
Ye... You do?

11:13.672 --> 11:16.426
So the only reason those jerks

11:13.672 --> 11:16.426
have been putting up with me

11:16.468 --> 11:17.844
is because they're afraid

11:16.468 --> 11:17.844
of my brother?

11:19.638 --> 11:22.307
Actually, we're a bit tired

11:19.638 --> 11:22.307
of your act, too.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.601
Those guys are nuts. I'm funny.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.354
Aren't I funny?

11:27.395 --> 11:30.440
To be honest,

11:27.395 --> 11:30.440
you  can  be a little caustic.

11:30.482 --> 11:34.194
The word...

11:30.482 --> 11:34.194
is arrogant.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.071
How about bitter, sarcastic

11:34.235 --> 11:37.071
and handsome?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.575
Hey, she's cute.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.956
Hey, Jeffrey.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.209
Do you need help

11:46.998 --> 11:49.209
crossing the street?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.751
(whimpering)

11:50.793 --> 11:52.837
Don't worry,

11:50.793 --> 11:52.837
I'm nice now.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.673
Come on.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.426
(shrieking):

11:55.882 --> 11:58.426
Jeffrey!

11:58.468 --> 11:59.927
How many times

11:58.468 --> 11:59.927
have I told you

11:59.969 --> 12:01.429
to stay out

11:59.969 --> 12:01.429
of that street?

12:01.471 --> 12:03.764
Oh! You are in

12:01.471 --> 12:03.764
so much trouble,

12:03.806 --> 12:05.183
young man!

12:03.806 --> 12:05.183
(Jeffrey sobbing)

12:06.725 --> 12:07.935
Hello?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.020
Yeah.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.564
I'm here to read to you.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.482
Okay.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.774
I was so glad

12:13.816 --> 12:15.485
when I heard

12:13.816 --> 12:15.485
you were coming.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.944
Really? Great.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.530
I just want to help.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.781
They said the terminal patients

12:20.823 --> 12:24.202
really get a lift

12:20.823 --> 12:24.202
from this kind of stuff.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.787
I'm sorry, did...

12:24.244 --> 12:26.787
did you say "terminal"?

12:33.836 --> 12:36.297
I'm in the wrong room.

12:36.339 --> 12:39.884
And come to think of it,

12:36.339 --> 12:39.884
I'm in the wrong hospital.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.803
Nurse!

12:42.845 --> 12:44.805
Nurse!

12:44.847 --> 12:46.807
CADET:

12:44.847 --> 12:46.807
Help! Help! Let me go!

12:46.849 --> 12:48.727
CADET ERIC:

12:46.849 --> 12:48.727
Happy birthday, Murphy.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.604
We've been looking

12:48.767 --> 12:50.604
for you for hours.

12:50.645 --> 12:51.812
MURPHY:

12:50.645 --> 12:51.812
Oh, please! Hey!

12:51.854 --> 12:53.440
Hey, my grandmother

12:51.854 --> 12:53.440
sent me a comforter!

12:53.481 --> 12:54.982
Take my comforter!

12:55.024 --> 12:56.859
You won't believe

12:55.024 --> 12:56.859
how soft it is! Ow!

12:56.901 --> 12:59.862
(mob singing):

12:56.901 --> 12:59.862
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

12:59.904 --> 13:01.489
(electrical buzzing)

13:01.531 --> 13:04.825

13:04.867 --> 13:08.413

13:08.455 --> 13:11.040
MURPHY:

13:08.455 --> 13:11.040
Oh, for God's sake, be careful.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.417
CADET ERIC:

13:11.082 --> 13:12.417
Oops.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.502
MURPHY:

13:12.459 --> 13:14.502
Oh, my God!

13:14.544 --> 13:16.921
(glass shattering)

13:19.382 --> 13:21.008
(screaming)

13:21.050 --> 13:22.469
I wish I could

13:21.050 --> 13:22.469
say this was

13:22.510 --> 13:24.262
the stupidest thing

13:22.510 --> 13:24.262
I've ever done.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.930
You know, on top of everything,

13:24.304 --> 13:25.930
they're going to make me

13:25.972 --> 13:27.223
fix the window

13:25.972 --> 13:27.223
when I get back.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.849
Don't be so hard on yourself.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.893
You have every right

13:28.891 --> 13:30.893
to be upset.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.353
I can't believe

13:30.935 --> 13:32.353
your parents

13:32.395 --> 13:34.272
are leaving you all alone

13:32.395 --> 13:34.272
on your birthday.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.814
You poor thing.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.943
Well, it isn't that bad.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.027
Yes, it is.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.946
Yeah, I guess you're right.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.366
You know, this is going to be my

13:41.988 --> 13:45.366
first birthday without a cake.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.951
You know what?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.662
You're not going to spend

13:46.993 --> 13:48.662
your birthday alone.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.037
You're coming to my place,

13:50.079 --> 13:51.914
and I'm going to make you

13:50.079 --> 13:51.914
a nice dinner.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.667
No.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.251
Why should you have

13:53.708 --> 13:55.251
to bother with me

13:55.293 --> 13:58.546
just 'cause I'm injured

13:55.293 --> 13:58.546
and... all alone?

13:58.588 --> 14:00.298
I'll even make you a cake.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.298
What kind do you...

14:00.340 --> 14:01.633
German chocolate.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.594
What's wrong?

14:04.636 --> 14:06.887
Ugh, I don't know, Hal.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.265
I guess this whole Francis

14:06.929 --> 14:09.265
thing is still bothering me.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.726
Yeah, me, too.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.144
Hey, you know what?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.480
Why don't we do something

14:13.186 --> 14:15.480
extra nice for him?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.692
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.692
What happened to you?

14:18.733 --> 14:21.068
What happened to me? I'll tell

14:18.733 --> 14:21.068
you what happened to me.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.903
Since Reese got

14:21.110 --> 14:22.903
whipped by that girl,

14:22.945 --> 14:24.739
he stopped being

14:22.945 --> 14:24.739
the school bully,

14:24.781 --> 14:27.200
so now there's no one

14:24.781 --> 14:27.200
to protect me from people

14:27.241 --> 14:29.369
who think I'm an unfunny

14:27.241 --> 14:29.369
little smart ass,

14:29.410 --> 14:30.911
which is evidently everyone.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.913
Well, you can be

14:30.953 --> 14:32.913
a little sarcastic.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.833
Thanks, Dad.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.833
I feel better.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.334
Case in point.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.920
Well, he  can  be.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.923
I'll go talk to him.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.844
(knocking)

14:46.969 --> 14:48.638
Rough day, huh?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.515
Yeah.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.975
You know, when people

14:50.557 --> 14:52.975
are mad at you,

14:53.017 --> 14:56.145
a simple apology can

14:53.017 --> 14:56.145
take you a long way.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.147
Let me give you

14:56.187 --> 14:58.147
a hypothetical.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.024
Let's just say,

14:58.189 --> 15:00.024
hypothetically,

15:00.066 --> 15:02.151
I told a coworker

15:00.066 --> 15:02.151
that it looked like my boss

15:02.193 --> 15:03.361
was highlighting his hair.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.945
And let's say, hypothetically,

15:04.987 --> 15:07.198
that the coworker

15:04.987 --> 15:07.198
then went to my boss

15:07.240 --> 15:08.742
and told him what I said

15:08.783 --> 15:10.744
and that,

15:08.783 --> 15:10.744
hypothetically speaking,

15:10.785 --> 15:13.120
my boss then moved me

15:10.785 --> 15:13.120
to the tiny office

15:13.162 --> 15:15.956
at the end of the hall,

15:13.162 --> 15:15.956
next to the copier.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.959
And if I had

15:15.998 --> 15:18.959
just apologized, Malcolm,

15:19.001 --> 15:22.129
you boys would all have

15:19.001 --> 15:22.129
your own bedrooms right now.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.632
So you're saying you wish

15:22.171 --> 15:24.632
you had apologized?

15:24.674 --> 15:26.634
Not to that pretty boy.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.261
Look, this hypothetical

15:28.302 --> 15:29.970
has nothing to do

15:28.302 --> 15:29.970
with your situation.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.931
Just think about it.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.644
Okay, I'll be over at 8:00.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.855
Yeah, feels much better.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.273
All right. Bye.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.234
Heard you got

15:42.024 --> 15:43.234
a hot date.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.862
Nah, just a nurse...

15:43.276 --> 15:45.862
with her own place.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.029
No biggie.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.989
You're a lucky

15:47.071 --> 15:48.989
man, Francis.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.700
You got a way

15:49.031 --> 15:50.700
with the ladies,

15:50.742 --> 15:52.911
you got parents

15:50.742 --> 15:52.911
who love you...

15:52.952 --> 15:54.287
What are you

15:52.952 --> 15:54.287
talking about?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.710
Hey, whose

15:58.040 --> 16:00.710
birthday is it?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.086
According to the card,

16:00.752 --> 16:02.086
it's yours.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.004
Wow.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.091
My family finally sent me a

16:04.046 --> 16:07.091
present, eight months late.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.009
Which is...

16:09.051 --> 16:10.887
(chuckles) ironic

16:10.929 --> 16:13.013
'cause my mom

16:10.929 --> 16:13.013
works at the post office.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.515
Started back in '87.

16:14.557 --> 16:15.975
Used to be a

16:14.557 --> 16:15.975
letter sorter.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.103
Okay, how about right here?

16:25.359 --> 16:26.444
Hey.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.488
What do you want?

16:28.529 --> 16:29.823
I just wanted to talk.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.031
What?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.450
I just want to

16:31.073 --> 16:32.450
say I'm sorry.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.534
About what?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.035
Remember the day

16:33.576 --> 16:35.035
it was raining

16:35.077 --> 16:36.537
and you said,

16:35.077 --> 16:36.537
"Hey, it's raining,"

16:36.579 --> 16:38.038
and I said,

16:36.579 --> 16:38.038
"Thanks, Einstein"?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.707
Yeah. Why'd you say that?

16:39.749 --> 16:41.083
My name's not Einstein.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.043
I was referring to

16:41.125 --> 16:43.043
Albert Einstein.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.672
He was this physicist

16:43.085 --> 16:45.672
who was a genius.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.048
You think I'm a genius?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.760
Oh, man, I've got, like,

16:48.090 --> 16:50.760
five good comebacks to that.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.137
But that was the old me.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.055
No, I was being

16:53.179 --> 16:55.055
sarcastic.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.350
I was kind of saying that you're

16:55.097 --> 16:57.350
the opposite of a genius.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.060
So... you were

16:57.391 --> 17:00.060
calling me stupid.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.729
Yeah, and that's why I...

17:03.147 --> 17:05.900
(punches continue,

17:03.147 --> 17:05.900
Malcolm groaning)

17:10.905 --> 17:13.741
I'm really glad we had

17:10.905 --> 17:13.741
this talk, Malcolm.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.327
Yeah, I feel

17:13.783 --> 17:16.327
a lot better now, too.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.704
Hey, Malcolm, come here.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.248
I finally figured it out.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.500
I found the answer.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.377
I know what I want

17:22.542 --> 17:24.377
to do with my life.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.004
Are you still selling

17:24.418 --> 17:26.004
those video games?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.380
Yeah. Five bucks.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.091
What are you doing?

17:31.133 --> 17:33.093
Selling my material possessions.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.095
Why?!

17:33.135 --> 17:35.095
'Cause Brother Billy

17:33.135 --> 17:35.095
told me to.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.764
Brother Billy?!

17:36.806 --> 17:39.099
You mean that nut who rides

17:36.806 --> 17:39.099
around in the school bus

17:39.141 --> 17:40.142
handing out pamphlets?

17:40.184 --> 17:42.102
It's called a manifesto.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.397
And he is not a nut

17:42.144 --> 17:44.397
once you stop and listen to him.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.107
He and his followers have

17:44.438 --> 17:47.107
this awesome compound in Oregon

17:47.149 --> 17:48.776
where we're going

17:47.149 --> 17:48.776
to live off the land.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.778
You're going off

17:48.818 --> 17:50.778
with this guy?!

17:50.820 --> 17:52.112
Don't worry,

17:50.820 --> 17:52.112
it is totally safe.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.114
They have guard dogs,

17:52.154 --> 17:54.114
watchtowers...

17:54.156 --> 17:55.950
Do Mom and Dad

17:54.156 --> 17:55.950
know about this?

17:55.992 --> 17:57.702
No, and you can't tell them.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.996
Brother Billy says they have

17:57.744 --> 17:59.996
negative energy and bad karma.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.164
You're talking about

18:00.038 --> 18:02.164
joining a cult.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.208
Are you nuts?

18:04.250 --> 18:06.126
Brother Billy

18:04.250 --> 18:06.126
doesn't talk to me like that.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.837
He makes me feel good

18:06.168 --> 18:07.837
about myself.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.006
It's called brainwashing, Reese.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.549
My name isn't Reese anymore.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.092
Then what is it?

18:14.635 --> 18:16.136
I don't remember,

18:14.635 --> 18:16.136
but it isn't Reese.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.430
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:17.471 --> 18:20.140
I have manifestos

18:17.471 --> 18:20.140
to distribute.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.184
Reese, you've

18:20.182 --> 18:22.184
got to help us.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.811
What?

18:23.853 --> 18:25.939
Your absence as a bully

18:23.853 --> 18:25.939
has created a power vacuum.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.566
Now the school is filled

18:25.980 --> 18:28.566
with rogue thugs

18:28.608 --> 18:31.069
carving out random

18:28.608 --> 18:31.069
spheres of influence.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.738
I've been hit up for

18:31.110 --> 18:33.738
my lunch money twice today.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.322
I've been hit

18:33.780 --> 18:35.322
up three times,

18:35.364 --> 18:37.241
and when I didn't

18:35.364 --> 18:37.241
have anything,

18:37.283 --> 18:39.243
they took my shirt!

18:39.285 --> 18:40.870
They took my shoes!

18:40.912 --> 18:42.413
My shoes!

18:42.455 --> 18:44.040
But what am I supposed

18:42.455 --> 18:44.040
to do about it?

18:44.082 --> 18:45.165
We need you back.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.167
What do you mean?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.167
I was a jerk.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.670
Yes, but you

18:47.209 --> 18:49.670
were the alpha jerk.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.047
Reese, without you,

18:51.089 --> 18:52.172
it's anarchy!

18:52.214 --> 18:53.466
Look around you.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.138
(laughs)

19:00.514 --> 19:02.725
Give me those.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.193
Don't you see?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.779
The whole school

19:13.235 --> 19:14.779
needs you back

19:14.821 --> 19:17.197
administering

19:14.821 --> 19:17.197
your unique form

19:17.239 --> 19:19.075
of evenhanded

19:17.239 --> 19:19.075
brutality.

19:19.117 --> 19:22.202
You're saying my being a bully's

19:19.117 --> 19:22.202
a good thing?

19:22.244 --> 19:24.664
Yes! You're

19:22.244 --> 19:24.664
our only hope.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.206
STEVIE:

19:24.705 --> 19:26.206
Stop it!

19:26.248 --> 19:27.416
Stop it!

19:27.458 --> 19:29.293
I'm...

19:29.335 --> 19:31.504
immune.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.214
I'm... immune!

19:34.256 --> 19:36.509
Hey! Stevie's off limits!

19:36.550 --> 19:38.177
He  used  to be.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.226
Get out of my way.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.980
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

nice boys.
