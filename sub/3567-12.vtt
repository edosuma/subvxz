WEBVTT

00:06.198 --> 00:11.869
- Ha! Take that!
- Wow, Amethyst, I'm impressed.

00:11.937 --> 00:15.007
- Now it's your move, Pearl!
- Steven, are the water

00:15.042 --> 00:19.263
- balloons really necessary?
- Yeah! This way the moves really matter.

00:19.298 --> 00:22.363
But it's checkers.
Every single move matters.

00:22.398 --> 00:26.450
It sounds like someone's
being a sore loser.

00:26.518 --> 00:31.297
I'm not a sore loser...
because I just won the game.

00:31.298 --> 00:35.393
Whaaaa?
Here it comes.

00:35.394 --> 00:37.795
Ahh, it feels good to lose.

00:37.896 --> 00:42.433
I certainly hope that's not the
attitude you have during battle.

00:42.500 --> 00:46.303
You're no fun anymore.
This is why we never form Opal.

00:46.371 --> 00:49.740
We don't form Opal
because you're difficult and a mess.

00:49.808 --> 00:53.092
We don't form Opal
because you're uptight and ...

00:53.152 --> 00:57.448
- Guys! Guys! What is Opal?!
- Oh, it's the two of us

00:57.515 --> 01:01.518
- mashed together.
- Is water just hydrogen and

01:01.620 --> 01:05.355
- oxygen "mashed together"?
- Uh...

01:05.357 --> 01:08.647
Analogy wasted.
Look here, Steven.

01:08.682 --> 01:11.795
When we synchronize our forms,
we can combine into a powerful

01:11.863 --> 01:15.799
- fusion gem named Opal.
- Except I don't dance like that.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.670
- Amethyst!
- Wow! That's so cool!

01:19.738 --> 01:24.356
- But tell me more about Opal!
- Well, Steven, she's an ultra-powerful,

01:24.463 --> 01:29.546
stone-cold betty. That part's me.
And she's, like, kind of tall.

01:29.614 --> 01:33.450
- That part's Pearl.
- What Amethyst is attempting to say is...

01:33.518 --> 01:38.115
Opal is an amalgam of our combined
magical and physical attributes

01:38.159 --> 01:42.326
- fused into a single entity.
- Wow! Can you do it right now?

01:42.427 --> 01:44.648
- Come on! Form Opal!
- Pfff!

01:44.649 --> 01:48.635
We only form Opal when
it's absolutely necessary.

01:49.118 --> 01:51.402
Garnet's back!

01:51.469 --> 01:55.406
Ooh! Ooh! Did you bring me anything?
Whoa! A rock!

01:55.473 --> 01:58.309
- Thanks, Garnet!
- So, was your mission a success?

01:58.376 --> 02:01.278
I've located the geode
beetles of heaven and Earth.

02:01.379 --> 02:05.365
- We should split up to retrieve them.
- Well, I'm going with not Pearl.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.651
That's perfect because
I don't want to go with

02:07.752 --> 02:11.488
- grammatically incorrect people anyway.
- Is her talking about me?

02:11.523 --> 02:13.908
You three go together. I go alone.

02:13.943 --> 02:16.360
- What? Why?
- The Earth beetle is

02:16.428 --> 02:22.733
at the bottom of the boiling lava
lake, and only I can swim in lava.

02:22.801 --> 02:27.265
You'll find the heaven beetle at
the top of the sky spire. It's safer.

02:27.300 --> 02:30.856
- You mean boring-er.
- You mean "more boring."

02:30.891 --> 02:32.443
So you agree with me.

02:32.544 --> 02:36.106
Come on, you two. Let's go.

02:36.141 --> 02:38.365
Steven, be sure
to keep the harmony.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.652
No problem.
Today's gonna be all about

02:41.720 --> 02:49.827
ha-a-a-a-rmo-o-o-o-o-ny!
Ugh!

02:49.894 --> 02:52.596
- Whoa! Is this where the heaven beetle lives?
- Apparently.

02:52.664 --> 02:57.301
- All the way at the top.
- So, when you fuse, do

02:57.369 --> 03:01.305
you turn into a giant giant woman
or just a regular-sized giant woman?

03:01.373 --> 03:03.807
- Ugh.
- Does one of you control the right arm

03:03.908 --> 03:07.277
- and the other control the left arm?
- Come on, Steven.

03:07.379 --> 03:10.481
Wait! These are extremely
important questions. Whew!

03:10.548 --> 03:15.719
There sure are a lot of stairs.
How about you form Opal and give

03:15.787 --> 03:18.907
- me a piggyback ride?
- No!

03:18.942 --> 03:20.882
What about if you eat
a hot dog?

03:20.917 --> 03:23.260
Whose stomach does it
go into, or do you share

03:23.328 --> 03:26.397
the same stomach?
That would be gross.

03:32.237 --> 03:34.305
Look out!
It's a magical goat guardian!

03:34.306 --> 03:36.373
Quick! You have to form Opal!

03:36.441 --> 03:43.647
It's the only way to defeat it!
Hurry before it kills us all!

03:43.715 --> 03:48.385
Steven, we only fuse for deadly situations.
Does this look like

03:48.453 --> 03:51.336
a deadly situation?
Ow! Hey!

03:51.371 --> 03:54.625
Bad mountain goat!

03:54.692 --> 03:59.329
Darn it.
Aw, I'm never gonna get to see Opal.

05:01.565 --> 05:04.328
- Steven, I'm not sure you can make those jumps.
- Oh!

05:04.395 --> 05:08.398
You should fuse into Opal, and then
lay across the rocks like a bridge!

05:09.762 --> 05:13.270
- We don't need Opal to get across.
- Can you do it anyway?

05:13.338 --> 05:18.208
- Please? It would be easier, wouldn't it?
- Not as easy as this!

05:18.276 --> 05:20.277
Waaaahhhhh!
Ooooh!

05:20.345 --> 05:23.747
Ooh. Wow, Amethyst.
That was a really good idea!

05:23.815 --> 05:26.817
I know. I'm full of 'em.

05:26.885 --> 05:30.654
Aw, come on, Pearl!
It's safe! Just look!

you worked together.

05:46.344 --> 05:48.670
Why don't you do that all the time?

05:52.699 --> 05:57.548
<i>I can't feel my legs anymore!</i>

05:57.615 --> 06:02.553
- Hey, look at that! It's a tiny temple!
- It's just where Garnet

06:02.620 --> 06:05.422
said it would be.
The heaven beetle should be inside.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.159
Check it out!
It's even got a little beetle

06:09.260 --> 06:13.656
<i>bedroom and little beetle bongos
and a little beetle baby book.</i>

06:13.691 --> 06:17.512
But where's the beetle?
It's supposed to be here.

06:17.547 --> 06:22.383
The heaven beetle wouldn't leave, would it?
Oh, it could be anywhere!

06:22.418 --> 06:24.693
Uh, maybe you
should freak out some more.

06:24.793 --> 06:28.412
- That's really gonna help us find it.
- I can't believe your attitude, Amethyst.

06:28.479 --> 06:31.548
And now you're just slouching
over here doing nothing!

06:31.607 --> 06:35.352
Hey! It's not my fault the beetle
isn't there! Why do you have

06:35.420 --> 06:38.294
<i>- to make things worse by squawking at me?
- I don't squawk!</i>

06:38.356 --> 06:41.525
<i>Yeah, you're squawking and
commenting on my posture!</i>

06:41.593 --> 06:46.230
Hey! Cut it out!
You're scaring Steven Jr.!

06:50.904 --> 06:52.358
My son.

06:59.191 --> 07:04.480
- In here, guys!
- It swallowed my spear!

07:04.515 --> 07:09.486
Guys, this is great! Now's the
perfect time for you two to form Opal!

07:23.278 --> 07:26.092
<i>Oh, brother.</i>

07:35.623 --> 07:39.683
Ugh! So, you wanna try that
again with less hitting

07:39.751 --> 07:43.587
- me in the face this time?
- Well, it would have worked if your

07:43.688 --> 07:47.524
- movements weren't so erratic and formless.
- So, it was all my fault?

07:47.592 --> 07:51.328
You totally weren't
even trying to sync with my dancing.

07:51.396 --> 07:56.581
- You should know how I dance by now!
- Stop! Come on, guys!

07:56.616 --> 07:59.775
Please stop fighting!
If you can't get along with each other,

07:59.810 --> 08:04.107
I might never get to see
your awesome fusion power!

08:04.175 --> 08:08.521
And I might get
eaten by a giant bird!

08:12.081 --> 08:14.385
- Steven!
- Unh!

08:17.522 --> 08:21.591
Steven Jr.!
How can you eat at a time like this?

08:21.659 --> 08:26.163
Hey, is that the heaven beetle?
Let me see it!

08:26.230 --> 08:32.993
Hey! Be a good goat
and give me the magic bug!

08:36.034 --> 08:39.606
I got it!
No! B-bad goat!

08:39.640 --> 08:42.250
You're no son of mine!

08:45.911 --> 08:49.720
What's going on?!
Steven Jr.! Oooh!

09:00.140 --> 09:01.993
Opal?

09:12.276 --> 09:15.345
Hup!

09:16.445 --> 09:19.162
Stay low.

09:51.349 --> 09:57.737
Uh... do you...
know who I am?

10:02.627 --> 10:05.956
A giant woman.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.085
We're back!

10:10.120 --> 10:13.666
- The heaven beetle.
- I don't have it.

10:16.057 --> 10:19.701
- Unh!
- Amethyst, you got distracted!

10:19.736 --> 10:22.036
Hey! You were
the one getting carried away

10:22.071 --> 10:25.003
- with all those fancy backflips!
- Wait a sec.

10:25.038 --> 10:28.189
I've got the beetle!

10:28.867 --> 10:31.003
Good job, Steven.

10:33.613 --> 10:37.038
I also see you helped
your teammates fuse.

10:38.309 --> 10:41.116
And all I had to
do was get eaten by a bird.

10:41.151 --> 10:44.763
Nice work.
You'll be great at fusing one day.

10:45.072 --> 10:48.648
Yeah.
Wait. I can do that, too?!
