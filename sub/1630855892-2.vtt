different, you know?

taking over the world

have to do more than apologize.

19:46.830 --> 19:49.627
I think you're gonna have
to make good financially.

19:49.711 --> 19:52.173

like five bucks a week

19:52.257 --> 19:53.927

did mean all of that.

You didn't help me.

a whole lot worse,

is gonna kill me.

And I mean, kill me.

you're an idiot,
