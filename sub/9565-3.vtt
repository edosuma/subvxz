00:00.192 --> 00:03.039
My new friends!
Rory's letting me blow his chanter.

00:03.201 --> 00:05.280
You just need to learn to finger it.

00:06.912 --> 00:09.240
- I will remember everything.
- I fancy you.

00:09.401 --> 00:11.800
I wanna have sex with you.
I can't do it from out here!

00:11.920 --> 00:14.520
Here I come, Cass. I'm coming.

Episode 3
SID

01:01.241 --> 01:03.578
<i>Sid, can you
get yourself down here?!</i>

01:05.760 --> 01:06.760
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:08.800 --> 01:10.049
Fucking hell.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.519
<i>You'd better help me here or...!</i>

01:12.681 --> 01:14.160
All right!

01:14.280 --> 01:15.720
All right.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.150
<i>Oh, come on, work,
you fucking thing!</i>

01:31.401 --> 01:32.880
Hit the video button.

01:33.081 --> 01:33.920
<i>Sid!</i>

01:34.040 --> 01:35.560
We can talk.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.080
Come on, you ditzy moo, it's the
big fucking red button marked "video".

01:44.160 --> 01:45.480
<i>Sid, I need your help!</i>

01:47.920 --> 01:49.880
- For Christ's sake!
<i>- Sidney!</i>

01:50.361 --> 01:52.799
Big fucking red button!

01:55.160 --> 01:56.409
There you are!

01:57.840 --> 01:59.430
Hey, sexy!

01:59.920 --> 02:01.120
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ!</i>

02:02.240 --> 02:03.240
Cass.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.685
Cass?

02:06.241 --> 02:07.800
<i>What the fuck is a ratchet lock?</i>

02:07.920 --> 02:11.440
Yes, you do, turn on
your sodding speakers! Cass.

02:12.024 --> 02:13.272
<i>Sid, what are you...?!</i>

02:13.392 --> 02:14.600
<i>Is it not working?</i>

02:15.228 --> 02:16.333
No.

02:17.801 --> 02:20.320
Sid. For Christ's sake. You made me

02:20.440 --> 02:23.720
buy that frigging Dyson and
I can't make the pissing thing...

02:24.773 --> 02:26.334
<i>Oh, that's...</i>

02:29.806 --> 02:31.265
That's...

02:32.320 --> 02:34.440
- ... my girlfriend.
- Right.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.669
So, she's in Scotland and...

02:39.280 --> 02:41.520
She doesn't know I can see her.

02:41.681 --> 02:42.681
Right.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.240
Because...

02:47.000 --> 02:48.814
Oh, fuck, no!

02:49.200 --> 02:50.319
<i>Fuck!</i>

02:54.201 --> 02:55.040
Fuck!

03:02.386 --> 03:04.904
- What do you think?
- Sex on a stick, so you are.

03:05.024 --> 03:06.296
Thanks, Lachlan.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.959
But the pink one ain't bad either.
Eh, no, Rory?

03:09.120 --> 03:12.426
Aye. He's a lucky,
lucky gadge, this Sidney.

03:12.546 --> 03:15.400
He's lovely!
I'm going to surprise him.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.199
Look at this.

03:22.110 --> 03:23.766
Help ma boab! Nice.

03:23.886 --> 03:25.039
Fucking A.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.434
You think he'll like it?

03:26.554 --> 03:28.720
Jings, you're almost
turning me straight here!

03:28.840 --> 03:31.471
Love is in the air! Eh, no, Rory?

03:31.591 --> 03:33.839
I'm feelin' it, man.
I'm feelin' it.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.800
It's one of those things,
shit happens.

03:41.961 --> 03:43.680
Is that the best you've got, Dad?

03:44.085 --> 03:46.559
- You always get my best, son.
- Because she's...

03:47.605 --> 03:51.279
Well, she says she loves me,
then she waltzes off to Elgin,

03:51.440 --> 03:53.560
now she's fucking
the Scottish rugby team!

03:53.680 --> 03:55.319
No. She's only fucking one of them.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.240
Stop trying to console me.
I'm inconsolable, OK?

03:59.360 --> 04:01.800
OK, OK! It's just...

04:01.920 --> 04:03.920
It's just women, you know?

04:04.040 --> 04:05.883
Hang on, are we comparing
women here?

04:06.003 --> 04:07.231
I don't know.

04:07.351 --> 04:10.320
Mum left you because you're
a total, world championship cretin.

04:10.481 --> 04:11.799
I'm not sure that that's...

04:11.960 --> 04:14.839
Mine's done this cos I'm
a gullible soft touch who's

04:15.040 --> 04:17.399
far, far, far too fucking nice
for his own good.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.120
There's no comparison, OK?

04:20.800 --> 04:23.120
But you've worked it out then.

04:23.281 --> 04:24.680
Didn't you?

04:24.800 --> 04:26.320
What is this thing?!

04:30.720 --> 04:34.399
Attach the guide nozzle to the
flange circulator? What the fuck?!

04:34.560 --> 04:37.360
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

04:37.521 --> 04:38.440
Dad...

04:38.560 --> 04:41.400
Your mother'll be here in a minute.
We've gotta get this...

04:41.520 --> 04:43.320
We've gotta clear it up.
And maybe...

04:43.440 --> 04:46.160
She's not coming back because
you tidied the house, Dad.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.919
Yeah? Yeah?
Oh, please. Something work.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.800
What time's your Dad arriving?

04:51.961 --> 04:52.961
12.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.319
We can do it if we concentrate.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.679
I thought he hated you.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.800
Who said my dad hates me?

04:59.476 --> 05:01.640
Well, you did, didn't you?

05:01.760 --> 05:04.698
He's not well.
We've got a few issues.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.033
Fuck!

05:08.000 --> 05:09.599
We should have started earlier!

05:10.443 --> 05:12.040
We should have started earlier!

05:13.160 --> 05:14.079
Anwar.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.560
How you doing, man?

05:18.680 --> 05:20.640
I'm not too good,
as it goes, actually.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.199
Right. I just thought I'd pop
round, wonder if you're busy.

05:24.835 --> 05:26.359
In the bedroom department.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.600
Your bedroom,
is it currently in use?

05:29.720 --> 05:33.279
My mum's coming to pretend to still
be married to my dad for my grandad.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.960
But this won't take long.

05:36.108 --> 05:37.231
What?

05:40.586 --> 05:41.599
This is Sketch.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.000
Yeah, I know who she is. She stalked
Maxxie, she got our drama teacher

05:45.120 --> 05:48.200
wrongly fired for sexual abuse
and she tried to poison Michelle.

05:48.361 --> 05:49.361
Yes.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.120
Sketch!

05:52.240 --> 05:53.719
I've come to my senses.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.880
She's sorry.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.080
Boy, she's sorry.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.799
Thing is, Sid,

06:00.961 --> 06:04.200
sex hasn't been invented yet
round at my place.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.471
Tricky with 2,000 years of
religious tradition.

06:07.591 --> 06:10.520
So me and Sketch were
wondering if we could...

06:12.320 --> 06:14.680
Come on. My whole family's
gonna be here in an hour.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.960
- It won't take long.
- It never takes long.

06:17.121 --> 06:19.159
You don't mind do you, Sidney?

06:19.320 --> 06:21.280
I do, actually, you know I...

06:25.080 --> 06:26.329
Oh, whatever.

06:38.672 --> 06:40.080
This is gut, ja?

06:40.420 --> 06:43.780
Oh, yes, Manfred.
It's lovely, but I've got to go.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.620
Thanks for the lift.

06:45.740 --> 06:46.999
But you will hurry,

06:47.161 --> 06:50.440
and tonight we will have
much more great sex, ja?

06:50.740 --> 06:51.840
Ja.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.164
I mean, yes, yes.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.360
Yikes!

06:57.660 --> 06:59.260
You are liking it like that, huh?

07:00.620 --> 07:02.040
Oh, fucking hell.

07:04.380 --> 07:08.303
I've got to go.
I've really, really got to go.

07:09.900 --> 07:12.280
Jesus wept.
Does she have to do that?

07:13.823 --> 07:17.020
I mean, what kind of
a fucked-up relationship is it

07:17.140 --> 07:19.700
where you have to jump each
other every time you say goodbye?

07:20.221 --> 07:21.518
A good one?

07:25.408 --> 07:26.520
Jesus...

07:26.780 --> 07:28.200
Jesus, Je... Bollocks!

07:53.320 --> 07:55.452
- Hi, Sid.
- Hi, Mum.

07:58.465 --> 08:00.340
- Mark.
- Liz.

08:03.180 --> 08:05.380
You all right, Sid?

08:05.500 --> 08:06.849
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:07.740 --> 08:09.380
You smell of something.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.060
It's just Opium.

08:13.180 --> 08:14.660
You know, perfume.

08:14.780 --> 08:15.840
You hate perfume.

08:16.140 --> 08:17.920
Manfred likes it.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.790
I'm sure
Manfred fucking loves it.

08:20.910 --> 08:23.780
I'm sure Manfred loves
rolling into Belgium,

08:23.900 --> 08:26.640
rounding up the Jews
and sending them to Poland,

08:26.940 --> 08:28.980
but hey, that's Blitzkrieg for you,

08:29.100 --> 08:32.240
and Manfred's gotta have
his Opium-scented Lebensraum. Right?

08:32.539 --> 08:35.320
- He can't help being German.
- Who can?

08:36.234 --> 08:38.520
Right, perhaps I should go home.

08:38.820 --> 08:40.820
You should come home.

08:40.940 --> 08:43.000
This is gonna be so silly.

08:43.340 --> 08:47.060
Why on earth did you tell your
father that we were together again?

08:47.180 --> 08:50.163
After that night, you know,
when you stayed...

08:52.821 --> 08:53.920
But that was just...

08:54.260 --> 08:56.600
I mean, you stayed and we...
I thought...

08:56.900 --> 08:58.320
You...

08:58.620 --> 08:59.680
You stayed?

09:00.924 --> 09:03.032
It was just one time.

09:05.060 --> 09:07.353
You know how the
old bastard loves you.

09:07.473 --> 09:10.360
I never got round to telling him
you were just fucking with my head.

09:10.660 --> 09:12.360
Right, that's it. I'm going.

09:12.660 --> 09:13.660
- No!
- No!

09:14.900 --> 09:16.028
Liz...

09:22.140 --> 09:24.920
... I can't make the
sodding Hoover work.

09:28.980 --> 09:30.680
For Christ sakes.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.560
Sid, load the dishwasher.
Have you any cigarettes?

09:44.860 --> 09:46.180
Oh, yeah.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.360
Thanks.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.216
Oh, God.

10:20.860 --> 10:24.020
Godfather. The Godfather Part Two.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.180
Apocalypse Now.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.520
The Conversation...

10:30.820 --> 10:31.980
It's not working.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.429
You gotta get some staying power.

10:35.139 --> 10:38.013
Don't you dare, boyo.
I am far, far from satisfied.

10:38.133 --> 10:40.230
OK. Oh... shit.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.220
Oh, fucking hell.

10:51.180 --> 10:53.840
- Hello, Mrs Jenkins.
- Hello, Anwar.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.020
This is Sketch.

11:00.015 --> 11:01.400
Nice to meet you.

11:02.586 --> 11:04.580
Sid didn't mention you were back.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.900
Yes, I'm not staying.

11:07.020 --> 11:10.060
Mum, you don't need to...
I can tidy my own...

11:10.180 --> 11:11.809
Oh... shit!

11:13.305 --> 11:17.780
Just having a lovely chat
with Anwar and his, um, new friend.

11:17.900 --> 11:21.080
How's your mum, Anwar?
I must give her a ring some time.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.920
Yeah, yeah, she's fine,

11:24.040 --> 11:25.040
she's fine.

11:25.340 --> 11:26.960
She's fine, yeah, but, you know...

11:27.673 --> 11:28.913
Muslim.

11:29.180 --> 11:31.480
She's been a bit busy Muslim...

11:35.100 --> 11:36.980
She doesn't know I have sex.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.100
Really?

11:38.620 --> 11:39.620
Well...

11:40.540 --> 11:41.589
Anyway...

11:45.580 --> 11:47.840
Make sure you
come again soon, Anwar.

11:48.479 --> 11:50.280
Yeah, cheers.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.280
Chance would be a fine thing.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.860
Isn't this nice?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.160
Yeah.

12:11.340 --> 12:12.340
Nice.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.749
How's Cassie?

12:18.780 --> 12:20.200
Still missing you, I bet.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.749
Actually, no.

12:22.580 --> 12:24.360
I don't think
she's missing me at all.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.140
Really? How's that?

12:26.260 --> 12:29.700
Oh, the usual. Woman dumps him
for no good reason

12:29.820 --> 12:32.100
without even explaining herself,

12:32.220 --> 12:35.060
falls into bed with some
random idiot with a big cock,

12:35.180 --> 12:37.340
you know the kind of thing.

12:38.993 --> 12:42.040
That's rotten, Sid. I'm sorry.

12:42.340 --> 12:44.000
I haven't been keeping up properly.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.300
No.

12:46.380 --> 12:49.760
I could explain, but it
wouldn't make any difference.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.080
To me it would.

12:51.420 --> 12:53.860
You heard him.
It would help if you explained.

12:53.980 --> 12:56.720
I mean, we're all here.
Let's explain.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.340
Bloody hell. He's early!

13:03.460 --> 13:05.140
Jesus Christ!

13:05.260 --> 13:06.700
Later, OK?

13:13.135 --> 13:14.514
Liza!

13:14.940 --> 13:16.460
How are you, Alex?

13:16.580 --> 13:19.080
Och, embracing adversity
as ever, my dear.

13:19.420 --> 13:22.640
But borne aloft
by the sight of you, lassie.

13:22.801 --> 13:23.809
Hi, Dad.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.725
You're going grey -
what have ye been doing?

13:25.845 --> 13:27.751
- Nothing.
- Where's my drink?

13:27.871 --> 13:29.580
Sandy! What a nice surprise.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.700
Aye, I ken it is, eh, no?

13:34.340 --> 13:35.832
You've brought the boys.

13:35.952 --> 13:38.618
They've been fair jumpin'
wi' excitement, ken, aye?

13:38.738 --> 13:41.080
Right... Hello, Lex.

13:41.967 --> 13:43.446
<i>Hallo, Ally.</i>

14:07.980 --> 14:09.420
It's nice.

14:11.540 --> 14:12.920
How's the work?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.269
It's fine.

14:14.880 --> 14:15.880
Interesting?

14:16.738 --> 14:18.020
Sometimes.

14:19.656 --> 14:21.611
What is it you do?

14:22.260 --> 14:24.880
Strategic analyst, Dad. OK?

14:25.180 --> 14:26.180
Aye.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.380
Well... done any good, um...

14:31.340 --> 14:33.240
analysing recently?

14:34.018 --> 14:35.389
I do my best.

14:35.509 --> 14:38.089
Well... as long as you've
done your best.

14:38.209 --> 14:40.360
Aye, that's the main thing, Da.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.680
That's the main thing.

14:47.140 --> 14:48.360
Who's that?

14:49.700 --> 14:50.640
Nobody.

14:52.580 --> 14:54.000
And... Sidney...

14:55.580 --> 14:58.940
- You still in the school, boy?
- Oh, A-levels, you know?

14:59.060 --> 15:03.120
A-levels? I hear they make them
nice and easy for you down here.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.320
- What?
- Subjects?

15:05.620 --> 15:08.160
Um, English, drama and psychology.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.260
Psychology? It's piss easy.

15:11.380 --> 15:13.012
No need o' psychology,

15:13.132 --> 15:15.640
staring doon the sights
o' a Stinger missile, ken, aye?

15:17.420 --> 15:19.319
Maybe Sidney is gonna be a...

15:20.140 --> 15:23.011
strategic analyst like his father.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.423
I might,
if my grades are good enough.

15:25.543 --> 15:26.719
Never rated grades.

15:26.893 --> 15:30.119
Few years in the Paratroopers
like Sandy here,

15:30.320 --> 15:31.320
that's wisdom.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.160
Aye. You learn early.
You learn hard.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.442
So now he's taking over
the business.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.029
He's what?

15:40.900 --> 15:42.549
I'm standing aside...

15:43.900 --> 15:45.400
because of my illness.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.982
The doctors are shaking their heads.
Nae idea.

15:49.102 --> 15:50.900
Pure phenomenal, Da.

15:51.020 --> 15:52.919
It's will. Iron will!

15:53.180 --> 15:55.519
Guts. Determination.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.640
Never say die, and here I have it.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.069
My legacy.

16:00.780 --> 16:01.799
Sandy?

16:02.490 --> 16:05.591
Sandy's gonna run
12 dry-cleaning shops?

16:07.280 --> 16:08.320
17.

16:09.060 --> 16:12.500
Bathgate is opening up.
City of the future.

16:13.404 --> 16:15.283
I'm leaving the business
in safe hands.

16:15.403 --> 16:17.479
Is that what you've come to tell me?

16:17.599 --> 16:20.520
Och, no. Wouldnae have bothered
coming all that way for...

16:20.820 --> 16:23.040
No, I'm buying a wee holiday place

16:23.340 --> 16:27.199
in Devon for Sandy
and the weans here.

16:27.460 --> 16:28.759
Nothing too fancy.

16:29.020 --> 16:30.840
1.7 million, ken, aye.

16:31.140 --> 16:35.479
Small change. Ye cannae put too high
a price on loyalty, eh, no Liza?

16:36.618 --> 16:39.379
No, Alex. But my names's not...

16:39.499 --> 16:41.633
Liza, you're a saint.

16:42.230 --> 16:44.680
A good cook is a saint.

16:45.513 --> 16:48.160
And she's a saint
for taking pity on you.

16:51.514 --> 16:53.411
She took you back.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.500
Lucky.

17:00.274 --> 17:01.489
So...

17:04.834 --> 17:06.319
Do you wanna go on the swing?

17:08.579 --> 17:09.640
Slide?

17:11.780 --> 17:12.960
Spliff?

17:13.260 --> 17:16.559
No? Say anything you like doing.
Anything at all.

17:16.760 --> 17:17.560
Fitba.

17:18.780 --> 17:19.799
You what?

17:20.060 --> 17:21.060
Fitba.

17:21.900 --> 17:22.880
Oh!

17:24.660 --> 17:26.420
Think I've got one...

17:26.540 --> 17:27.888
Used to... A-ha!

17:29.140 --> 17:30.400
Football!

17:31.900 --> 17:33.839
Not too good at this.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.959
How about I go in goal and...?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.568
Square go!

17:38.080 --> 17:40.185
- Ya bastard!
- Stick the heid on him!

17:53.020 --> 17:54.224
Hold still.

17:55.828 --> 17:58.679
Will I tell him what we used
to do to bullies in the desert, pal?

17:58.840 --> 18:00.960
- But... I didn't.
- I'm sure it was an accident.

18:01.260 --> 18:03.878
We used to tie them to
the bonnet o' the Saracen,

18:03.998 --> 18:07.120
roast their bollocks for
a couple o' hours, ken, aye.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.159
You'll never dance
the fucking samba again.

18:10.420 --> 18:11.519
That's enough.

18:12.677 --> 18:13.928
Aye, Da.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.600
Sidney's sorry. Aren't ye, son?

18:26.140 --> 18:27.119
Yes.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.200
There you go.

18:29.580 --> 18:30.760
Sorted like men.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.419
Now, if you'll just tell us
where we're sleeping, hen.

18:34.748 --> 18:36.519
- Wait a minute!
- You're staying?

18:36.780 --> 18:39.140
Couple of days. Three, tops.

18:39.260 --> 18:40.720
Don't want to put you out.

18:51.420 --> 18:54.260
I am not sleeping with you
just cos your fucking dad's here!

18:54.380 --> 18:56.600
I had no idea they were staying.

18:56.900 --> 18:59.020
Why don't you stand up to him?
Tell him.

18:59.140 --> 19:01.039
I can't.
He's dying for Christ's sake!

19:01.200 --> 19:02.480
Oh! I'm going home.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.799
Tell me there's not a part of you
that wants to stay.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.060
Mark...

19:07.905 --> 19:09.399
You're not good for me.

19:09.660 --> 19:12.020
Tell me you don't love me.

19:12.140 --> 19:14.679
Go on.
Tell him you don't love him.

19:15.911 --> 19:18.347
Then you can fucking stop this. OK?

19:22.860 --> 19:24.340
Answer it.

19:30.580 --> 19:31.580
Hello.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.460
No, I'm still here.

19:34.580 --> 19:37.400
Yes, well, it's a bit difficult.

19:37.700 --> 19:41.436
No, I'm sorry, Manfred.
I meant to text but... Don't!

19:42.100 --> 19:43.639
No. No, of course not.

19:45.197 --> 19:46.320
Oh, Manfred.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.540
You're not coming round!

19:50.660 --> 19:51.660
No. No!

19:53.940 --> 19:56.200
- Mark! Mark!
- Yes, Dad.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.000
I cannae get hot water.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.040
What?
You have to jiggle the thing.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.479
Then fix it, man.
What's wrong with you?

20:04.740 --> 20:07.220
- I haven't had the time.
- Time?

20:07.340 --> 20:08.740
Time?!

20:08.860 --> 20:12.679
How long does it take to strip
down a shower unit? Minutes!

20:12.940 --> 20:13.940
Da! Da!

20:15.180 --> 20:16.180
It's OK.

20:16.860 --> 20:20.580
Sorted. Some eejit forced
the pressure regulator.

20:21.609 --> 20:22.560
Aye...

20:25.420 --> 20:26.420
So...

20:28.520 --> 20:29.560
I'm going.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.340
I'm going to bed.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.980
Goodnight.

20:42.780 --> 20:45.320
Handsome young lassie,
always said that.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.369
Och, aye. She's steamy.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.960
I hope I can sleep tonight
in that bed.

20:53.940 --> 20:55.900
Man in my condition.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.420
Night, bro.

21:08.980 --> 21:12.000
Alex, Sandy, Lex, Ally.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.020
Kinda weird.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.780
They're all called Alexander.

21:17.378 --> 21:18.405
Yup.

21:20.648 --> 21:23.055
- Except you.
- Except me.

21:26.100 --> 21:27.820
Why don't you stand up to him?

21:29.860 --> 21:31.620
Dad's always been ill.

21:32.490 --> 21:35.437
- What with?
- It's, er...

21:38.500 --> 21:40.000
I don't actually know.

21:41.597 --> 21:45.580
I think every time I see him,
it's gonna be the last time and...

21:45.700 --> 21:47.360
You can't take chances with that.

21:47.660 --> 21:50.120
He calls you stupid
and useless and crap.

21:52.380 --> 21:54.607
My father's disappointed.

21:54.727 --> 21:56.620
They often are.

21:56.740 --> 21:59.160
Is that how you see me?

22:02.500 --> 22:03.439
Never.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.702
I'm useless and crap.

22:05.822 --> 22:08.705
I fuck everything up
and it drives you mad.

22:08.825 --> 22:10.712
You hear me, Sid?

22:11.500 --> 22:12.520
Never.

22:14.957 --> 22:16.760
Make her stay.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.520
Mark.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.160
Get into bed.

23:04.002 --> 23:06.975
I'll probably never change
that much.

23:07.978 --> 23:09.911
Don't talk.

23:11.036 --> 23:13.061
Just do something.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.760
I want you to do some...

23:28.600 --> 23:30.810
Oh, ja... ist gut...!

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
What?!

23:33.871 --> 23:35.000
Nothing.

23:46.960 --> 23:47.960
<i>Sid?</i>

23:48.200 --> 23:49.280
<i>Sid, you there?</i>

23:49.400 --> 23:51.520
<i>I found the button.</i>

23:57.903 --> 23:59.052
<i>Sid?</i>

23:59.400 --> 24:01.732
<i>I can see you!</i>

24:02.880 --> 24:04.560
<i>That's so cool.</i>

24:04.680 --> 24:08.440
<i>I could fucking see everything
you were doing.</i>

24:08.880 --> 24:09.880
<i>What?</i>

24:12.885 --> 24:15.600
<i>Oh, God! No, that was...</i>

24:15.760 --> 24:18.240
<i>- I'm such a tit.
- Sid?</i>

24:19.462 --> 24:20.720
<i>I just thought...</i>

24:21.774 --> 24:23.659
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

24:24.120 --> 24:27.994
<i>Nothing ever works out, does it?
Nobody ever waits.</i>

24:28.240 --> 24:31.720
<i>Nobody ever loves anyone properly,
do they?</i>

24:31.880 --> 24:34.880
- <i>You've got it wrong, Sid.</i>
- <i>Just leave me alone.</i>

24:35.040 --> 24:37.307
- <i>You rang me!</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

24:40.905 --> 24:42.328
<i>Don't you trust me, Sid?</i>

24:42.600 --> 24:43.609
<i>No.</i>

24:44.540 --> 24:46.680
<i>I don't trust you.</i>

24:48.006 --> 24:50.720
<i>You're up there fucking
Oor Fucking Wullie or</i>

24:50.840 --> 24:52.360
<i>whoever the fuck it is and...</i>

24:53.016 --> 24:54.576
<i>I can't talk to you.</i>

25:04.040 --> 25:05.189
Fuck!

25:15.480 --> 25:16.480
Shit!

25:32.988 --> 25:34.622
Gott in Himmel!

25:35.840 --> 25:38.880
Where is she?
Lizzie! Com raus!

25:39.320 --> 25:40.320
Hang on!

25:40.560 --> 25:42.320
Lizzie! Liebchen!

25:44.289 --> 25:45.839
You must come with me!

25:46.000 --> 25:47.960
No, Manfred, please!

25:48.515 --> 25:50.000
Who the fuck's this?

25:50.160 --> 25:52.560
Manfred. He's a... friend.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.920
Leave it to me!

25:56.126 --> 25:58.320
Screw you, man!
I vant my chick!

25:58.480 --> 25:59.840
What... Who?

26:05.806 --> 26:06.880
Square go.

26:11.065 --> 26:12.360
Get out!

26:13.101 --> 26:16.320
I vant my baby! And vat I vant,

26:16.545 --> 26:17.720
I take!

26:17.880 --> 26:18.880
Stop!

26:21.370 --> 26:23.144
But, he is ein plinker!

26:23.575 --> 26:26.114
You are saying, he is ein plinker!

26:26.234 --> 26:27.240
Plonker.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.200
- Right...
- I was angry.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.774
It's fine.

26:31.560 --> 26:34.760
Manfred, you're bleeding.
I'm going to take you to hospital.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.476
I feel nothing! Nothing...

26:43.221 --> 26:44.799
I'll call you in a couple of days.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.809
I need time to think.

26:47.342 --> 26:48.427
OK?

26:51.600 --> 26:53.349
Manfred? Manfred?

26:54.177 --> 26:55.180
Raus!

26:55.600 --> 26:58.200
We're going to hospital.

27:13.505 --> 27:15.640
Cannae hold on to your woman, eh?

27:18.560 --> 27:23.048
Fuck off out of my house,
you miserable Scottish cunt.

27:25.160 --> 27:28.783
You... You, you... what?!

27:29.695 --> 27:32.165
I know what your game is, Alex.

27:32.285 --> 27:36.240
It's a fucking good yin.
But I'm not buying it. You got me?

27:37.481 --> 27:38.481
Dad?

27:38.960 --> 27:40.469
It's OK, Sid.

27:40.766 --> 27:42.720
They're all leaving!

27:44.059 --> 27:45.820
Right now!

28:03.419 --> 28:04.419
OK?

28:05.720 --> 28:06.866
Yup.

28:18.112 --> 28:20.160
I think I dumped Cassie.

28:21.213 --> 28:24.003
She's with some guy.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.360
They're always with some guy.

28:28.802 --> 28:30.680
If they're special,

28:30.800 --> 28:33.440
you just have to make sure that
that guy...

28:33.560 --> 28:35.153
is you.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.130
All right?

28:48.760 --> 28:50.040
Thanks, Dad.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.320
No problem, son.

30:05.676 --> 30:07.974
Little Scottish bastards.

30:09.480 --> 30:11.445
Hey, Cassie.

30:11.974 --> 30:14.448
Everything was a bit weird.

30:14.568 --> 30:17.160
Look, I'm sorry about last night.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.144
Er, we need to talk now.

30:21.093 --> 30:22.661
Everything's...

30:28.444 --> 30:31.120
Jesus,
the fucking signal in this house!

30:34.880 --> 30:37.320
<i>Sorry. The user has blocked
your call.</i>

30:38.288 --> 30:39.437
Idiot!

30:40.720 --> 30:42.154
Ah, fuck!

31:06.929 --> 31:07.929
Dad?

31:33.504 --> 31:34.707
Dad?

32:47.746 --> 32:50.000
You sure you're OK with that, Tony?

32:50.360 --> 32:51.880
It's fine. Give me a sec.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.240
Maybe you should take it easy, mate.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.880
Jesus, Chris,
maybe you should take it easy!

33:03.040 --> 33:05.600
Nah. Angie's coming back today.
I'm a bit...

33:05.760 --> 33:07.040
She's been in touch?

33:07.200 --> 33:09.039
Not as such. But I know
she still loves me.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.520
Chris. She's your psychology teacher.
It was just a fling.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.840
No, it wasn't.
OK? She needed her space.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.480
Right, and now I really need her
naked, buffed, gagging and slippy

33:19.600 --> 33:21.440
in my bed, because...

33:21.560 --> 33:24.371
You know, four months without sex,
that ain't funny.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.799
You probably
wouldn't understand that, Jal.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.115
You don't have sex at all, do you?
You have clarinet lessons.

33:31.235 --> 33:33.240
I do... I mean, I have had...

33:33.400 --> 33:35.960
Look, we're not counting
fapping here, Jal, right,

33:36.320 --> 33:38.839
cos if we were, I'd have had sex
14 times in two days.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.560
I haven't had sex for...

33:41.680 --> 33:43.120
A long time.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.304
Right.

33:44.424 --> 33:47.240
OK, in summary then,
we all need some pussy action.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.720
And I shall be getting mine
tonight with the lovely Angela.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.850
Hey, you all right Sid?

33:59.077 --> 34:01.479
- You two still not talking?
- He stopped coming round.

34:02.100 --> 34:05.719
Tony, he sat with you for months.
He read fucking Anna Karenina to you.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.760
I don't remember.
He must have stopped.

34:09.300 --> 34:10.400
Mate.

34:21.679 --> 34:24.199
Hey, Sid. Do your coursework?

34:25.800 --> 34:26.972
No...

34:35.960 --> 34:38.280
Morning! All right.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.719
Yes, quickly please.

34:41.120 --> 34:44.120
First of all, I've had a word
with the Imam at Redcliffe Mosque

34:44.239 --> 34:47.320
about the school musical last month.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.480
I explained that
it was all meant to be ironic

34:50.600 --> 34:52.437
and he was very understanding.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.623
He's not exactly sure
who imposed the fatwa,

34:55.744 --> 34:57.080
but it wasn't him.

34:57.818 --> 35:00.080
Probably somebody in Iran.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.040
So - what a relief.

35:02.939 --> 35:05.332
And secondly, I have to inform you

35:05.452 --> 35:07.600
that Angela will not be returning

35:07.760 --> 35:09.600
to teach psychology at the college.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.040
She's sent me this message.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.440
"Dear everyone.
I'll never forget you and hope

35:15.560 --> 35:19.560
"you all do great in the A2s."
Well, that's nice, isn't it?

35:19.680 --> 35:22.381
And I don't quite understand this.

35:22.501 --> 35:25.521
"Tell Monkeyman
I'll miss the spaghetti."

35:25.825 --> 35:26.720
Anyone?

35:28.800 --> 35:31.360
In the meantime,
I'll be doing my best.

35:31.480 --> 35:35.120
Biology, psychology,
is there really any difference?

35:35.240 --> 35:38.680
So folders open,
and let's make a start on...

35:40.640 --> 35:43.040
Loss! Oh, fantastic!

35:43.516 --> 35:45.733
So what do we all know about loss?

36:11.089 --> 36:12.220
Sid?

36:13.186 --> 36:15.920
I didn't know what to do.
So I came to college.

36:17.367 --> 36:18.840
What's happened?

36:25.585 --> 36:29.086
Everyone says you looked after me
when I was... iconic.

36:31.502 --> 36:32.506
Intimate.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.331
Fuck! Fuck!

36:38.680 --> 36:39.680
Ill...

36:40.240 --> 36:41.680
I mean, ill.

36:44.963 --> 36:46.560
I just can't remember you.

36:47.953 --> 36:50.142
I reckon it was pretty scary.

36:52.760 --> 36:56.200
I know why you stopped coming.
I would have, too.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.560
It was so awful.

37:00.197 --> 37:01.925
You were so awful.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.960
That bus fucked you up so bad, Tone.

37:07.298 --> 37:08.921
I just couldn't...

37:09.213 --> 37:10.560
I know.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.640
What's happened?

37:24.871 --> 37:26.348
I can't say it.

37:29.722 --> 37:31.619
Know how that feels.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.830
Let's go for a drink.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.307
Sid?

38:56.660 --> 38:59.176
Tony! Hi! Tony!

39:00.432 --> 39:01.900
Oh. Hi, Abi.

39:02.020 --> 39:04.199
Aren't we so kicking?

39:04.361 --> 39:07.300
James says he wants me to sing
lead on his next song he writes

39:07.420 --> 39:09.900
because I'm like totally
Performance Art.

39:10.020 --> 39:14.500
Anyway, I bet you can't wait
to take me home tonight, yah?

39:15.499 --> 39:16.599
I'm with Sid.

39:16.761 --> 39:20.039
You wouldn't
desert your girlfriend, OK?

39:21.180 --> 39:23.079
You're not his girlfriend.

39:23.241 --> 39:26.380
Well, actually I don't think
you get to decide that, Sidney.

39:26.601 --> 39:28.820
Tony loves Michelle.

39:28.940 --> 39:30.780
They're having a few problems.

39:30.961 --> 39:32.660
He can't remember stuff well.

39:32.780 --> 39:36.820
But I know whatever
you've told him is a total lie.

39:36.940 --> 39:40.380
So fuck off
and leave him alone. OK?

39:40.500 --> 39:42.519
Tony! You remember?

39:43.540 --> 39:46.100
I have nipples like
creme caramels, yah?

39:51.401 --> 39:52.900
Sid says I love Michelle.

39:53.020 --> 39:53.980
No!

39:54.161 --> 39:55.410
You... You...

39:59.105 --> 40:00.786
I'll be back.

40:04.616 --> 40:08.820
The moment you've all been
waiting for. Crystal Castles. Yeah!

42:53.080 --> 42:54.072
Where?

43:02.580 --> 43:04.408
I can't go in.

43:05.580 --> 43:06.829
Yes, you can.

43:07.860 --> 43:08.860
Come on.

43:22.340 --> 43:24.004
Ficking hell.

43:25.152 --> 43:26.349
Fucking...

43:27.620 --> 43:28.620
Yeah.

43:29.740 --> 43:31.180
Fucking hell.

43:33.740 --> 43:34.740
Dad?

43:56.423 --> 43:58.533
Is this really happening?

44:01.220 --> 44:02.660
I think so.

44:34.428 --> 44:36.959
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do to him.

44:38.580 --> 44:39.829
Ring someone.

44:40.940 --> 44:42.215
I can't,

44:43.060 --> 44:44.309
they'll come.

44:45.972 --> 44:47.941
They'll all fucking come.

45:11.400 --> 45:13.220
Do you think he'd mind?

45:27.860 --> 45:29.547
He was so happy.

45:31.740 --> 45:32.860
My mum.

45:34.820 --> 45:36.519
Oh, Christ.

45:36.681 --> 45:37.681
OK.

45:45.340 --> 45:46.340
Dad?

45:47.940 --> 45:49.340
What do I do?

46:07.860 --> 46:08.860
Mum?

47:03.720 --> 47:05.759
- You went to see Tony?
- It's over, Sid.

47:05.921 --> 47:07.820
{3}It's a present.
For the good times.

47:08.001 --> 47:09.600
Allah Akbar!
