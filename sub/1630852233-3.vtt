17:18.537 --> 17:20.289
They are being taught
in that classroom right there

17:20.289 --> 17:22.416
by Mrs. Howard,
the oldest teacher here.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.252
Let's go change some lives.
Come on. Let's go.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.545
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What are you doing in here?

17:26.545 --> 17:28.547
Because you really should not
be in here.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.132
We saw your video,
Mrs. Howard,

17:30.132 --> 17:31.926
so we wanted to
come down here in person

17:31.926 --> 17:34.136
and see the look on your face
when we ‐‐

Thank you, but the list
has already ‐‐

‐What video?

‐Should we get a happy one, too?
‐Get out of here!

‐Let's get both. Let's get both.
‐Hey. Get out.

‐What?
‐Oh, no, no.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.148
We're gonna do something
super respectful.

Yeah. "Oh, no, no, no.

Do you want me to take off
my other earring?
No.

‐Definitely not.
‐Get out.

Get out!

Shameful.
Shameful.

Who even
let y'all in here?!

17:59.579 --> 18:02.290
What was that all about?

Can I talk to you
for a second?

18:09.505 --> 18:12.508
Ava made...

18:12.508 --> 18:15.845
I asked Ava to make a video
to promote your wishlist

18:15.845 --> 18:17.096
because it worked for me,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.681
and I knew your class
needed stuff.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.851
And it got a lot of attention,
clearly,

18:21.851 --> 18:23.769
because it was a bit
over‐the‐top.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.021
How far over‐the‐top?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.731
Really, really
over‐the‐top.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.066
Like, if you went to the top,
you wouldn't be able to find it,

18:29.066 --> 18:30.943
'cause it was way up there.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.404
I'm sorry. I just wanted you to
have all the tools you deserve

18:33.404 --> 18:34.739
and that your kids deserve.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.782
My kids don't have
half the supplies they need

18:36.782 --> 18:38.743
most of the time, but they
don't need to know that.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.286
Yeah, but I saw your kids

18:40.286 --> 18:42.079

empty water colors.

18:42.079 --> 18:45.291
It's our job ‐‐
Our job
is to build them up,

18:45.291 --> 18:46.751
make them confident.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.045
Is it nice to have stuff?
Sure.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.547
But my students do not need
to feel less than

18:51.547 --> 18:53.966
because they do not
have stuff.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.927
So, we talk about
what they do have,

18:56.927 --> 18:58.638
not about what they don't.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.808
[ Exhales deeply ]

19:02.808 --> 19:06.896
That was a painfully well‐said
reality check.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.732
So, um, are you gonna
give the stuff back?

19:09.732 --> 19:10.775
Oh, hell no.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.193
[ Chuckles ]
I'm keeping all of that.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.779
Besides, do you know how
expensive those staplers are?

19:14.779 --> 19:16.697
They're so expensive.
Mm.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.325
And thank you for trying.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.203
Your hyperactive little heart
was in the right place.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.082
Hey, Gregory, um,
I just wanted to apologize

19:26.082 --> 19:29.293
for inserting...myself...

19:29.293 --> 19:31.295
Wha...

19:31.295 --> 19:33.422
This looks amazing.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.800
I think
it looks good, too.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.551
Yeah, I still don't know what
kind of teacher I want to be,

19:37.551 --> 19:39.845
but I think I want to stay
around and figure it out.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.682
Plus, the kids probably want
to see their art on the wall.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.892
This is a, um,
interesting piece.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.770
That is you
as a businessman.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.105
‐Really?
‐Yes.

Gregory: Okay, 'cause I thought
I was a building.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.608
I'm ‐‐ I'm really bad
at this.
Mm. No.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.361
Um, the trick is if you see,
like, a really big circle,

19:55.361 --> 19:56.654
that's usually the head.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.073
And if you see bananas,
those are usually fingers.

19:59.073 --> 20:01.492
So, yeah.
Oh, yeah!

20:01.492 --> 20:03.160
Yeah. Okay. Yes.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.287
I'm really, really good
at deciphering this stuff,

20:05.287 --> 20:07.289
so I'll help you.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.918
Well, alright. So, I'm at a,
um, construction site here.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.504
No, you're at a playground.
Those are the kids.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.256
But this is
a caution sign.
