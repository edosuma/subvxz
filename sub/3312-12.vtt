WEBVTT

00:06.674 --> 00:09.543
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.380
SO, MOM, YOU KNOW HOW ENDLESS
A KITCHEN REMODEL CAN BE.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.981
I NEVER WANT TO GO
THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.184
YES, BUT IT'S ALL WORTH
IT WHEN IT'S DONE.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.751
WHEN WILL IT BE FINISHED?

00:17.785 --> 00:19.287
IT IS FINISHED.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.588
REALLY?

00:20.621 --> 00:22.590
SO ALL THIS IS INTENTIONAL?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.725
( laughs )

00:24.758 --> 00:26.627
HEY, SLOW DOWN THERE, YOU TWO.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.430
I'VE GOT SOME SOLID
FOOD COMING HERE.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.999
IT'S SO NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU,
MONICA, PUT A FACE TO THE NAME.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.501
WHAT BROUGHT YOU TO TOWN?

00:33.534 --> 00:36.137
WELL, I WAS WAITING FOR A SPECIAL
OCCASION, LIKE A WEDDING,

00:36.170 --> 00:39.340
BUT WHO ARE WE KIDDING? I'M
NOT GOING TO LIVE FOREVER.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.343
THAT'S RIGHT, MOM. NOT
MARRIED, STILL SINGLE...

00:42.376 --> 00:44.578
CAN'T POINT THAT OUT ENOUGH.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.081
I GUESS MR. RIGHT MUST
HAVE TAKEN A WRONG TURN.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.716
( Monica and Joey laugh )

00:48.749 --> 00:51.652
MONICA, WOULD YOU GO TELL THE
KIDS WE'RE READY TO EAT?

00:51.685 --> 00:53.621
THE CHILDREN ARE GOING
TO JOIN US FOR DINNER?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.156
AT THE SAME TABLE?

00:55.189 --> 00:57.625
YEAH, WE TRY TO ALL EAT TOGETHER,
YOU KNOW, LIKE A FAMILY.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.227
AND YOU SIT WITH US TOO?

00:59.260 --> 01:02.496
I KNOW. IT'S NUTS AROUND HERE.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.466
WELL, NO HUSBAND AND NO
CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN,

01:05.499 --> 01:08.369
BUT STILL A FULL TABLE. OOH
OOH, IT'S LIKE A PLAY...

01:08.402 --> 01:10.404
A SAD LITTLE PLAY.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.640
YOU KILL ME, MOM. YOU REALLY DO.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.708
LENNOX, DINNER!

01:14.742 --> 01:16.710
AND YOU TOO...

01:16.744 --> 01:19.147
YOUNG MAN.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.814
HOW DO YOU PUT UP WITH THAT?

01:20.848 --> 01:23.451
OH, YOU MEAN OUR LITTLE
MOTHER-DAUGHTER BACK-AND-FORTH?

01:23.484 --> 01:25.253
SHE JUST HAS A SARCASTIC
SENSE OF HUMOR.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.121
NO, I HAVE A SARCASTIC
SENSE OF HUMOR, ALL RIGHT?

01:27.155 --> 01:29.089
SHE'S... SHE'S MEAN.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.591
YOU JUST HAVE TO LAUGH IT OFF.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.261
YEAH? OR IN YOUR
CASE SCRATCH IT OFF?

01:33.294 --> 01:35.796
IT'S NO BIG DEAL. I GET HIVES
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

01:35.829 --> 01:36.830
LIKE WHEN?

01:36.864 --> 01:38.632
YOU KNOW, LIKE CHRISTMAS,

01:38.666 --> 01:40.834
THANKSGIVING, MOTHER'S DAY.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.337
BURKE, COME ON. IT'S SO OBVIOUS.
ALL THIS STUFF YOU'RE LAUGHING OFF

01:43.371 --> 01:45.673
YOU'RE ACTUALLY SPELLING OUT IN TINY
RED DOTS ON YOUR ARM. LET ME SEE THIS.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.709
WHAT DOES IT SAY? OH YEAH,
LOOK AT THAT... "HELP ME."

01:48.742 --> 01:51.179
OH, LOOK WHAT THIS ARM SAYS...
"BUTT OUT."

02:16.770 --> 02:18.138
I NEED BREAKFAST.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.741
YOU CAN EAT NEXT
WHEN GRANDMA'S GONE.

02:20.774 --> 02:21.709
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING UP?

02:21.742 --> 02:24.412
GOING TO SCHOOL.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.879
AT 6:00 A.M.?

02:25.913 --> 02:28.716
YEAH, WE LIKE TO BE
THERE WHEN IT OPENS.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.718
YEAH, IT'S REALLY COOL WHEN
THEY UNCHAIN THE GATES

02:30.751 --> 02:33.287
AND WAKE UP ALL THE
HOMELESS GUYS.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.389
YOU'RE DOING ALL THIS TO AVOID
SEEING YOUR GRANDMOTHER, AREN'T YOU?

02:35.423 --> 02:38.526
I CANNOT LISTEN TO HER CRITICIZE
ANOTHER ONE OF MY OUTFITS

02:38.559 --> 02:41.429
AND TELL ME THAT
I'M ASKING FOR IT.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.831
YOU KNOW, SHE STILL
DOES NOT KNOW MY NAME.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.267
SHE CALLS ME "TALL BOY."

02:46.300 --> 02:47.835
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP
HER OUT, YOU KNOW,

02:47.868 --> 02:49.737
WEAR A NAME TAG OR SOMETHING.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.273
OH MY GOD, LIGHTS. OKAY,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.441
HOLD ON.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.409
THIS IS NOT CEREAL.
THIS IS CROUTONS.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.844
CLOSE ENOUGH. LET'S GO.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.815
HEY, JOE.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.918
I LOVE THIS TIME OF DAY.
DON'T YOU?

03:04.952 --> 03:07.187
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
THIS TIME OF DAY.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.689
NOT TRUE.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.891
I USED TO STUMBLE HOME AT
THIS HOUR ALL THE TIME.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.660
ANYWAY, I'M OFF TO WORK.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.528
WHY DON'T YOU STOP SNEAKING
AROUND TO AVOID YOUR MOTHER

03:14.562 --> 03:16.797
AND JUST ADMIT THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER IS PRETTY SCREWED UP?

03:16.830 --> 03:19.833
BECAUSE THEN I'D HAVE
TO DEAL WITH IT.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.669
AVOIDING YOUR MOTHER
IS NOT HEALTHY.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.271
THERE'S NOTHING
UNHEALTHY ABOUT IT.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.740
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

03:26.774 --> 03:28.576
SURE I WISH I HAD A BETTER
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY MOTHER,

03:28.609 --> 03:30.444
BUT I DON'T. THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.845
SO I'VE MADE PEACE WITH THAT.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.582
SEE? PEACE.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.518
YEAH, I SEE A PIECE OF SKIN
HANGING OFF RIGHT THERE.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.721
YOU KNOW, YOU'D LIVE A LOT LONGER IF YOU
ACTUALLY HAD A REAL CONVERSATION WITH HER.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.723
WE'RE BURKES. BURKES
DON'T DO THAT.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.860
LONGOS DO.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.831
RUMOR IS THE WHOLE NEXT SEMESTER

03:50.864 --> 03:52.866
IS GONNA BE PILATES OR ZUMBA.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.536
ANYTHING WITHOUT FLYING BALLS
OR STICKS COMING AT ME.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.237
I REALLY LIKE MY
NOSE WHERE IT IS.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.540
( blows whistle )
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

03:59.573 --> 04:01.809
FOR THE NEXT TWO
MONTHS WE WILL EAT,

04:01.842 --> 04:04.578
SLEEP AND CRAP SOCCER.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.214
THIS WEEK... HEADING THE BALL.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.317
I NEED A VOLUNTEER.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.984
YOU, GLICKMAN.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.820
ATTAGIRL. NEXT TIME
USE LESS FACE.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.823
OKAY, TAKE A LAP AND THEN
45 MINUTES OF HEADERS.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.358
COME ON.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.560
I AM SO NOT DOING THIS.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.462
WELL, YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.632
COACH DALMAN ONLY EXCUSES YOU
IF YOU'RE DEAD OR DYING.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.667
AND EVEN THEN, YOU'D BETTER
HAVE A NOTE FROM THE CORONER.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.969
COME ON, MILLER,
SCANLON, LOOK ALIVE.

04:29.002 --> 04:32.740
UM, LISTEN, COACH DALMAN,

04:32.773 --> 04:35.008
I NEED TO BE EXCUSED FROM P.E.
TODAY.

04:35.042 --> 04:38.712
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM. JUST
SHOW ME YOUR OBITUARY.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.849
IT'S, YOU KNOW, MY PERIOD.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.985
PLEASE, WE WOMEN CAN DO
WHATEVER WE WANT ON OUR PERIOD.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.455
WE CAN CLIMB MOUNTAINS.
WE CAN DECLARE WAR.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.890
WE CAN EVEN WEAR
WHITE STRETCH PANTS.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.759
SO IF IT'S YOUR PERIOD,

04:51.792 --> 04:53.994
YOU CAN GIVE ME AN EXTRA
20 LAPS FOR STARTERS.

04:54.027 --> 04:57.365
NO NO NO NO NO, I DON'T HAVE MY PERIOD.
IT'S NOT MY PERIOD.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.566
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

04:58.599 --> 04:59.867
I SO DO NOT HAVE MY PERIOD.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.769
I WISH I HAD MY PERIOD.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.437
OH.

05:03.471 --> 05:06.474
( whispers ) OH, DO YOU
MEAN YOU'RE PREGNANT?

05:07.608 --> 05:09.443
YOU SAID IT.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.880
HONEY, IF YOU ARE, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY
NOT BE OUT HERE PLAYING SOCCER.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.516
- WELL, I GUESS YOU KNOW BEST.
- YES, I DO, SCANLON.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.619
OKAY, YOU JUST GET SOME HOMEWORK
DONE, PUT YOUR FEET UP,

05:18.652 --> 05:21.021
TEXT YOUR BABY DADDY.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.057
COME ON! YOU RUN LIKE GIRLS!

05:24.091 --> 05:26.794
( blows whistle )
SHAKE THAT ASS!

05:30.698 --> 05:33.501
MY GOODNESS, EVERYONE
HERE GETS UP SO EARLY.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.536
IT'S 11:00.

05:35.569 --> 05:39.072
THEN IT'S TIME FOR A BIG BUBBLY

05:39.106 --> 05:41.475
GLASS OF BREAKFAST.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.378
DID MEL SAY WHEN SHE
WAS COMING HOME?

05:44.412 --> 05:46.980
IT'S TUESDAY... COUNCIL DAY.
SHE'LL BE HOME AT 7:00.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.950
AND IT'S NOT LIKELY SHE HAS
A DATE, SO 7:00 IT WILL BE.

05:49.983 --> 05:53.320
WOW, YOU EVEN THROW SHOTS
AT HER WHEN SHE'S NOT HERE.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.423
SHOTS? ARE YOU REFERRING TO

05:55.456 --> 05:57.558
OUR LITTLE MOTHER-DAUGHTER
BACK-AND-FORTH?

05:57.591 --> 05:59.326
YOU KNOW, THAT LITTLE
BACK-AND-FORTH, I THINK,

05:59.359 --> 06:01.028
IS SOMETIMES PRETTY
HURTFUL TO MEL.

06:01.061 --> 06:05.633
MY, THE STAFF DOES VOICE ITS
OPINION AROUND HERE, DOESN'T IT?

06:05.666 --> 06:08.101
YES, IT DOES, YEAH.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.971
AND ANOTHER THING THAT
IT'S CURIOUS ABOUT IS:

06:11.004 --> 06:14.107
IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE YOU
CAME TO YOUR DAUGHTER'S HOUSE.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.609
AND YOU'D LIKE TO
KNOW WHY I'M HERE?

06:15.643 --> 06:18.011
YEAH, I REALLY WOULD.

06:18.045 --> 06:22.483
I'M HERE BECAUSE MY OTHER
DAUGHTER IS IN PRISON

06:22.516 --> 06:25.886
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO
SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH MY FAMILY

06:25.919 --> 06:27.788
WHILE MY HUSBAND
RUSSELL IS IN MEXICO

06:27.821 --> 06:30.824
BEDDING A 28-YEAR-OLD
YOGA INSTRUCTOR.

06:32.793 --> 06:36.029
THAT'S SOME NEW INFORMATION.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.098
AND IT'S OUR
ANNIVERSARY TOMORROW.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.400
THAT'S MY GIFT FROM RUSSELL...
BETRAYAL.

06:40.434 --> 06:43.804
HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW
TO SHOP FOR YOU.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.940
SERIOUSLY, WOW. I'M SORRY.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.909
I NEVER WOULD HAVE SAID
ANYTHING IF I'D KNOWN THAT.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.110
BUT HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:50.143 --> 06:52.513
SINCE WE'RE KIND OF TALKING NOW,

06:52.546 --> 06:54.515
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

06:54.548 --> 06:57.084
I THINK YOU DESERVE A LOT BETTER THAN THAT.
HOW DO YOU STAND IT?

06:57.117 --> 07:00.153
I HAVE MY WAYS.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.623
I THINK YOU SHOULD TREAT YOURSELF
A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.091
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF
LIFE LEFT AHEAD OF YOU.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.494
YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE REST
OF IT BEING MISERABLE, DO YOU?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.496
LOVELY TALKING TO YOU, JOE.

07:08.529 --> 07:12.065
I THINK I'LL TAKE THE REST
OF MY BREAKFAST UPSTAIRS.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.603
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.005
AVOID ALL MY BRILLIANT ADVICE.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.574
ALL BURKE WOMEN DO.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.846
- ( game playing )
- HEY.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.414
HEY, I HEARD YOU
GOT OUT OF SOCCER.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.949
NOBODY GETS OUT OF
DALMAN'S CLASS.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.653
SHE MADE SHIRA COHEN PLAY FIELD
HOCKEY WITH A BROKEN FEMUR.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.489
YOU COULD SEE IT POKING OUT.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.726
YEAH, WELL, I FELL
INTO A LOOPHOLE.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.894
THERE'S A LOOPHOLE?

07:40.928 --> 07:42.763
LET ME HAVE IT.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.932
DALMAN THINKS I'M PREGNANT.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.902
YEAH, THAT PROBABLY
WOULDN'T WORK FOR ME.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.871
I JUST WANTED TO
GET OUT OF SOCCER.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.973
SHE HAD ME KNOCKED UP BEFORE
I KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

07:53.006 --> 07:56.076
JUST TO BE CLEAR... YOU'RE NOT
ACTUALLY PREGNANT, RIGHT?

07:56.109 --> 07:58.579
OF COURSE NOT. AND IN
A COUPLE OF MONTHS

07:58.612 --> 08:00.948
SHE'S GONNA EXPECT ME TO LOOK
LIKE I'VE SWALLOWED A BASKETBALL.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.016
UGH, THIS IS WRONG.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.653
I HATE SOCCER, BUT I'VE GOT
TO TELL HER THE TRUTH.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.055
YEAH YEAH, TELL HER
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.691
THAT WAY THEY CAN ANNOUNCE
YOUR DEATH AT NOON ASSEMBLY.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.694
MAYBE WE'LL EVEN GET A
HALF-DAY OUT OF IT.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.668
OKAY, 7:00.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.670
IF HISTORY IS ANY
GUIDE, MY MOM SHOULD BE

08:22.703 --> 08:24.905
IN THE MIDDLE OF
HER MARTINI NAP.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.774
NO, SHE'S WIDE AWAKE.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.710
HEY, MEL, I GOTTA TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING

08:29.743 --> 08:31.579
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
REALLY WANT TO HEAR,

08:31.612 --> 08:33.714
BUT TODAY

08:33.747 --> 08:37.484
I GOT TO KNOW YOUR
MOTHER A LOT BETTER.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.888
EWW, GROSS! WITH MY MOTHER?
HOW COULD YOU?

08:40.921 --> 08:42.590
WHAT? EWW. ARE YOU...

08:42.623 --> 08:44.157
I HAVE A LITTLE MORE
RESTRAINT THAN THAT. PLEASE.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.894
NO, LOOK, WE GOT TO
TALKING, ALL RIGHT?

08:46.927 --> 08:48.195
WE GOT TO REALLY TALKING.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.731
EWW, TALKING?!
THAT'S EVEN WORSE.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.733
HEY, WE HAD A VERY
REVEALING CONVERSATION

08:52.766 --> 08:54.702
THAT WAS QUITE THERAPEUTIC
FOR HER, I THINK.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.671
SO LOOK, THIS IS NOT GONNA
BE EASY FOR ME TO SAY.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.106
YOU MAY WANT TO SIT DOWN.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.875
THIS IS BAD, HUH? REALLY BAD?

09:01.909 --> 09:03.811
IT IS.

09:03.844 --> 09:07.247
LOOK, SHE TOLD ME THAT

09:07.280 --> 09:10.651
YOUR FATHER'S BEEN
CHEATING ON HER.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.621
THAT'S IT? ( laughs )

09:13.654 --> 09:15.989
IT'S SO CUTE HOW YOU
THINK THAT'S NEWS.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.992
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK LIKE
A SWEET LITTLE PIXIE,

09:19.026 --> 09:21.729
BUT YOU'RE VERY DARK, BURKE.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.196
OH, MEL DEAR, YOU'RE HOME.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.298
I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING...
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.968
I WONDER WHAT IT COULD BE.
IT MIGHT BE SHOCKING.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.203
I SHOULD BRACE MYSELF.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.205
TOMORROW IS OUR
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

09:32.239 --> 09:34.842
AND RUSSELL HAS USED THIS
OCCASION TO CHEAT ON ME.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.810
WHAT?

09:36.844 --> 09:39.279
AND AS A RESULT, I HAVE DECIDED
TO DIVORCE YOUR FATHER.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.648
WHAT?!

09:40.681 --> 09:42.983
I WISH I HAD NEVER
LAID EYES ON THAT MAN.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.552
NOTHING GOOD HAS EVER
COME FROM THIS MARRIAGE.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.888
MOM, HELLO.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.057
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY, DEAR.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.959
I DID GET TO MEET NANCY REAGAN.

09:51.992 --> 09:55.295
ANYWAY, I NOW SEE
THINGS SO CLEARLY,

09:55.328 --> 09:57.931
THANKS TO THE SUPPORT
AND ENCOURAGEMENT

09:57.965 --> 09:59.667
OF MY GOOD FRIEND JOE.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.201
JOE? REALLY?

10:03.170 --> 10:04.972
SO ONE CONVERSATION
WITH JOE LONGO,

10:05.005 --> 10:06.974
AND MY PARENTS' ENTIRE
MARRIAGE BLOWS UP?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.308
NICE WORK. VERY THERAPEUTIC.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.010
I JUST TOLD HER THAT
SHE DESERVED BETTER.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.578
YEAH, BUT SHE REALLY DOESN'T.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.180
- HE CHEATS ON HER.
- SHE CHEATS ON HIM.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.683
THAT DIDN'T COME UP.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.617
IT'S THEIR THING. THEY'RE
MEANT FOR EACH OTHER.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.052
THEY HAVE THIS ALL WORKED OUT.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.722
ALL WORKED OUT? BURKE, IT'S BEEN
YEARS OF MISERY AND DENIAL.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.024
NAME ME ONE GOOD THING THAT'S
COME OUT OF THIS MARRIAGE.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.927
ME! WHY DOES EVERYONE
KEEP LEAVING ME OUT?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.329
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS
YOUR FATHER IS ON VACATION

10:29.362 --> 10:31.198
WITH A WOMAN HALF HIS AGE
ON THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.366
I THINK HER SHOWING UP
HERE IS A CRY FOR HELP.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.635
NO, WHEN MY MOTHER CRIES
FOR HELP, IT SOUNDS LIKE,

10:35.669 --> 10:39.106
"ESPERANZA, DONDE
ESTA EL VALIUM?"

10:39.139 --> 10:41.108
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK
THIS IS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE,

10:41.141 --> 10:43.944
'CAUSE SHE'S FINALLY TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING
FOR REAL. YOU NEED TO BE THERE FOR HER.

10:43.977 --> 10:47.014
YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF THE DARK FORCES
YOU HAVE JUST UNLEASHED, OKAY?

10:47.047 --> 10:48.716
FIRST COME HIVES, THEN
COME THE LOCUSTS.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.917
YOU'RE OVERREACTING
A LITTLE BIT.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.852
OH? WE'LL SEE WHO'S
OVERREACTING TOMORROW

10:51.885 --> 10:54.054
WHEN THE SUN TURNS TO BLOOD
AND IT BEGINS RAINING FROGS.

10:54.087 --> 10:57.390
IS IT GONNA CLEAR UP BY THE WEEKEND?
'CAUSE I HAVE A SOFTBALL GAME.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.831
( knocks )\ HEY, COACH.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.065
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

11:05.098 --> 11:06.900
SURE, SCANLON, ANYTIME.

11:06.934 --> 11:10.670
EVERYTHING OKAY WITH YOU TWO?

11:10.704 --> 11:13.073
ACTUALLY, NO.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.075
I WAS THINKING ABOUT YESTERDAY

11:15.108 --> 11:17.077
AND GETTING OUT OF SOCCER,

11:17.110 --> 11:19.046
AND I NEED TO BE TOTALLY
HONEST WITH YOU.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.681
THIS WHOLE BABY THING...

11:21.715 --> 11:23.016
I FEEL SO ASHAMED.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.920
OH, HONEY, DON'T WALLOW IN
REGRET AND SELF-RECRIMINATION.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.689
SHOULD YOU HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL?
YES.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.792
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO'S MADE A MISTAKE.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.426
THREE OUT OF 10 GIRLS
IN THIS COUNTRY

11:33.460 --> 11:35.228
GET PREGNANT BEFORE
THEY TURN 20.

11:35.262 --> 11:38.899
THAT'S 2000 GIRLS EVERY
DAY JUST LIKE YOU.

11:38.932 --> 11:42.169
WELL, NOT JUST LIKE ME.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.972
SEE, COACH, I NEED TO TELL YOU

11:45.005 --> 11:46.740
I FEEL REALLY BAD.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.109
OH, LENNOX, IT COULD
HAPPEN TO ANYONE.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.378
IN FACT, WHEN I WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

11:51.411 --> 11:53.847
IT HAPPENED TO ME.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.382
OH BOY.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.385
WHEN I WENT THROUGH IT, THERE
WAS NO ONE TO TURN TO.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.854
BUT I WILL BE HERE FOR YOU

12:00.888 --> 12:02.790
EVERY DAY.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.026
AWESOME.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.761
AND DON'T WORRY,

12:07.795 --> 12:10.363
YOUR LITTLE SITUATION WILL
BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.731
Girl: HEADS UP!

12:11.765 --> 12:13.100
HEY, WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE THROWING THAT!

12:13.133 --> 12:15.435
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
THIS GIRL IS PREGNANT!

12:20.040 --> 12:21.809
HI MOM.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.310
OH, HELLO, DARLING.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.245
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:25.278 --> 12:28.481
REDECORATING. YOU KNOW HOW
IT ALWAYS LIFTS MY SPIRITS.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.018
I GOT RID OF YOUR
TIRED OLD DRAPES.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.921
OH, YOU MEAN MY TIRED
OLD BRAND NEW DRAPES

12:33.954 --> 12:36.790
THAT MAKE ME SO HAPPY WHENEVER
I WALK INTO MY HOUSE?

12:36.824 --> 12:39.326
OH, HONEY, YOU CAN'T EXPECT
ME TO LIVE WITH THOSE

12:39.359 --> 12:42.062
DAY AFTER DAY, WEEK AFTER WEEK.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.363
WHOA, WEEK AFTER WHAT?

12:43.396 --> 12:45.198
SO YOU'RE STAYING?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.167
I CAN'T GO BACK TO
THAT GEORGETOWN HOUSE.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.169
I NEED TO HEAL IN THE
BOSOM OF MY FAMILY.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.171
AND YOU ARE ALL THAT'S LEFT,

12:51.204 --> 12:53.173
SO I HAVE TO MAKE DO.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.845
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD, JOE.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.512
SHE'S MOVING IN AND
STAYING FOREVER.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.281
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.
- YES, I DO.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.150
SHE'S IN THERE RIGHT NOW
TAKING DOWN MY DRAPES.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.818
AND MY POOR PILLOWS ARE NEXT.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.820
SHE'S REDECORATING WHAT
I JUST REDECORATED.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.356
SHE'S RE-REDECORATING.
AND I RE-RESENT IT.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.224
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S GONNA
STAY HERE FOREVER, BURKE.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.194
SHE'S TRYING TO KEEP HERSELF BUSY. SHE
WANTS TO BE A PART OF THE FAMILY.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.863
OH, THAT'S A CHANGE.
BACK WHEN I WAS A KID,

13:15.896 --> 13:17.130
SHE COULDN'T WAIT TO
GET RID OF HER FAMILY.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.166
SHE PRACTICALLY PUSHED ME AND
MEREDITH OUT OF THE HOUSE.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.102
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SAID YOU AND
YOUR SISTER WERE HORRIBLE TEENAGERS.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.171
WELL, WE WERE. THE THIRD
TIME I WAS ARRESTED,

13:24.204 --> 13:26.139
MY MOTHER MADE MY
FATHER GET A VASECTOMY

13:26.173 --> 13:28.876
SO THIS INCONVENIENT CHILD THING
WOULD NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.079
THOSE ARE TENDER MEMORIES, HUH?

13:32.112 --> 13:34.114
PIECE BY PIECE, SHE
WILL DESTROY MY HOUSE.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.816
BURKE, RELAX, OKAY?
PILLOWS, DRAPES...

13:36.850 --> 13:39.186
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE JUST THINGS.
RISE ABOVE.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.121
WHAT THE...

13:41.154 --> 13:43.556
HEY, WHO THE HECK SCRATCHED MY
BRAND NEW CALPHALON SKILLET?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.558
OH, I THINK MONICA
WAS HEATING UP

13:45.592 --> 13:47.227
SOME STUFF FOR HER
MUD MASK IN THAT.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.796
WHAT THE HELL DID SHE
STIR IT WITH, A BACK HOE?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.231
LOOK AT THIS THING. IT'S RUINED.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.868
MY GOD, IT'S LIKE SHE
STRIKES AT WHAT YOU LOVE.

13:54.902 --> 13:58.305
RISE ABOVE, JOE.
IT'S JUST A THING.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.174
THIS WOMAN'S GOTTA GO, BURKE.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.017
MAYBE YOUR MOTHER WILL PACK
UP AND LEAVE IF WE TELL HER

14:10.050 --> 14:11.484
THAT OHIO RAN OUT OF ALCOHOL.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.921
IF SHE STAYS HERE
LONG ENOUGH, IT WILL.

14:13.954 --> 14:17.357
HEY, AUNT MEL, WE GOTTA TALK.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.092
IS THIS GONNA BE ONE OF
THOSE GIRL CONVERSATIONS?

14:19.126 --> 14:20.894
'CAUSE I'M MORE THAN HAPPY
TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.130
JOE, STAY. LOOK, I THINK
YOU BOTH SHOULD KNOW

14:23.163 --> 14:26.399
THAT THERE'S A RUMOR GOING
AROUND SCHOOL THAT I'M PREGNANT.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.868
WHO WOULD START SUCH
A VICIOUS RUMOR?

14:28.902 --> 14:31.338
GIVE ME NAMES. I'LL KILL THEM.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.872
- IT WAS ME.
- Joe: YOU?

14:32.906 --> 14:35.042
WHO THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO KILL NOW?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.044
WELL, I HAVE A SUGGESTION.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.148
I DIDN'T MEAN TO. I
JUST TOLD MY COACH

14:41.181 --> 14:42.382
I WANTED TO GET OUT OF SOCCER.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.284
LISTEN, YOU ARE GONNA
MARCH IN THERE

14:44.317 --> 14:46.186
AND TELL YOUR COACH THE
TRUTH IMMEDIATELY.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.022
I WILL NOT HAVE EVERYONE RUNNING AROUND
SAYING LENNOX SCANLON IS PREGNANT.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.324
OH MY GOD! LENNOX IS PREGNANT?!

14:51.358 --> 14:53.326
BUT SHE'S A CHILD!

14:53.360 --> 14:56.063
NO NO NO NO NO, YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.331
I DO UNDERSTAND.
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.234
THIS WILL MAKE ME A
GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.535
THE TRUTH IS...

15:02.569 --> 15:05.372
UH, UH, LENNOX, NO
MORE SECRETS, OKAY?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.074
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
YOUR GRANDMOTHER LIVED

15:07.107 --> 15:09.276
IN A HOUSE WITH TEENAGERS,
BUT THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.310
BUT I'M NOT...

15:10.343 --> 15:12.645
LENNOX, LENNOX, LISTEN
TO YOUR AUNT, OKAY?

15:12.679 --> 15:14.948
SHE'S GOT A PLAN TO HANDLE THIS
HORRIBLE TEENAGE SITUATION.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.483
LOOK, YOU GO UP TO
YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW

15:16.516 --> 15:18.451
AND TURN THAT ROCK MUSIC UP
AS LOUD AS YOU CAN GET IT

15:18.485 --> 15:20.887
AND YOU THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.457
IT'S LIKE THIS EVERY DAY...
ONE CRISIS AFTER ANOTHER.

15:24.491 --> 15:28.128
SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT
TO PACK UP AND LEAVE THIS MADHOUSE.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.330
IN FACT, I'M GONNA CALL YOU A TOWN
CAR TO TAKE YOU TO THE AIRPORT.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.599
TOWN CAR? FORGET THAT. I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE AIRPORT MYSELF RIGHT NOW.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.668
YOU KNOW, I HAD BEEN THINKING
THAT MAYBE I WAS BEING RASH,

15:35.702 --> 15:38.005
THAT MAYBE MY PLACE
IS BACK IN D.C.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.207
EXACTLY. THAT'S YOUR PLACE.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.109
BUT NOW THAT LENNOX IS
GOING TO HAVE A BABY,

15:42.142 --> 15:43.610
YOU NEED ME HERE MORE THAN EVER.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.512
NO NO NO NO NO. RIGHT, JOE?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.981
SHE'S RIGHT. WE GOT THIS.
GO HOME.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.683
I KNOW I WASN'T THE BEST MOTHER,

15:50.717 --> 15:52.519
BUT HELPING LENNOX
RAISE HER BABY

15:52.552 --> 15:54.387
WILL GIVE ME A CHANCE TO
MAKE UP FOR ALL THAT.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.556
NO NO, YOU WERE A GREAT MOTHER.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.159
REMEMBER I GAVE YOU THAT
SHOT GLASS THAT SAID THAT?

15:59.192 --> 16:01.028
DON'T WORRY, MEL DEAR.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.495
IT'S ALL GOING TO BE FINE.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.032
MOTHER'S HERE.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.068
STOP SCRATCHING.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.505
MOTHER, LENNOX HAS SOMETHING
SHE NEEDS TO TELL YOU.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.210
GRANDMA, I'M NOT PREGNANT,
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.579
I MADE UP THE WHOLE THING
TO GET OUT OF SOCCER,

16:19.612 --> 16:21.448
WHICH ISN'T A SPORT REALLY.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.083
IT'S MORE LIKE A GANG
FIGHT IN KNEE SOCKS.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.518
THAT'S IT, OKAY.
THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.554
I WILL BE UPSTAIRS

16:27.587 --> 16:29.389
SAVING MYSELF FOR MARRIAGE.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.358
SO SHE'S NOT PREGNANT?

16:31.391 --> 16:34.494
NO NO, IT WAS JUST A
MISUNDERSTANDING, MOTHER.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.363
- OH, THAT'S A RELIEF.
- YEAH.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.099
SO NOW THAT WE'RE NO
LONGER IN CRISIS,

16:39.132 --> 16:41.468
YOU CAN GO ON WITH THE NEXT
EXCITING CHAPTER OF YOUR LIFE.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.071
AND I WAS THINKING...
YOU LOVE TO TRAVEL,

16:44.104 --> 16:47.474
SO HOW ABOUT I SEND YOU ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD YOU WANT TO GO...

16:47.507 --> 16:51.078
COSTA RICA, MAJORCA,
THE SOUTH POLE?

16:51.111 --> 16:53.646
LOOK, YOU CAN SWIM
WITH THE PENGUINS.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.648
THAT'S VERY KIND, BUT
I COULD NEVER GO

16:55.682 --> 16:57.750
ON A TRIP LIKE THAT
WITHOUT YOUR FATHER.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.752
HE ALWAYS TOOK CARE OF ME.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.754
WELL, IF YOU MISS DADDY,

17:01.788 --> 17:04.291
THEN WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO HIM
AND WORK IT OUT LIKE ALWAYS?

17:04.324 --> 17:06.393
THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT.
HE LEFT ME FOR A WOMAN

17:06.426 --> 17:09.762
YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE MY
MUCH YOUNGER SISTER

17:09.796 --> 17:12.499
ON OUR ANNIVERSARY.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.034
THIS ONE REALLY HURTS.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.736
WOW, MOM.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.738
OF ALL THE CONVERSATIONS
WE'VE EVER HAD,

17:18.771 --> 17:21.574
THIS ONE IS THE MOST REALEST.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.511
I SUPPOSE IT WAS,
BAD GRAMMAR ASIDE.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.447
WELL, YOU ARE WELCOME TO STAY
HERE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.216
WITHIN REASON.

17:29.249 --> 17:33.019
AND BY "WITHIN REASON" I MEAN...

17:33.052 --> 17:34.554
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.527
THERE WE GO.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.563
DON'T YOU WORRY. THAT MEAN
LADY IS NOT GONNA TOUCH YOU.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.499
HEY, JOE. BIG BREAKTHROUGH...

17:46.533 --> 17:47.734
I'VE INVITED MY MOTHER TO STAY.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.469
SHE AND I ARE ACTUALLY
GETTING ALONG.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.538
AND LOOK... NO
ITCHING, NO BUMPS.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.273
GOOD FOR YOU.

17:53.306 --> 17:56.109
BAD FOR YOU.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.345
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY A MIDDLE-AGED MAN

17:58.378 --> 18:01.148
WOULD LEAVE HIS WIFE FOR A
28-YEAR-OLD YOGA INSTRUCTOR.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.416
NOW THAT I SAID IT OUT
LOUD, I KINDA GET IT.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.186
BUT WHAT COULD SHE
POSSIBLY GET FROM HIM?

18:06.219 --> 18:08.555
A HOUSE, MONEY,

18:08.588 --> 18:10.657
A BABY, WHICH, YOU KNOW,
WOULD GUARANTEE MORE MONEY.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.626
REALLY? SO YOU THINK
SHE'S ONLY WITH HIM

18:13.660 --> 18:15.528
TO HAVE A KID AND GET
ON THAT GRAVY TRAIN?

18:15.562 --> 18:18.265
A TALE AS OLD AS TIME.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.433
NOW THAT'S SOMETHING
I CAN WORK WITH.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.303
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, HUH?

18:23.336 --> 18:26.473
SAFE TO TAKE THE SKILLET
OUT OF THE BOX OR WHAT?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.544
- COACH.
- SCANLON.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.080
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
GREAT NEWS.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.149
TURNS OUT THE WHOLE PREGNANCY
THING WAS A FALSE ALARM.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.385
I CAN PLAY SOCCER NOW.
WOOT WOOT!

18:38.418 --> 18:41.421
REALLY? YOU'RE NOT...

18:41.454 --> 18:45.425
NOT AT ALL. TURNS OUT I
JUST CAN'T COUNT TO 28.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.495
WELL, AFTER I POURED
MY HEART OUT TO YOU...

18:48.528 --> 18:50.697
BUT I GUESS YOU
MUST BE RELIEVED.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.633
I AM, AND I AM SO GLAD
I HAD SOMEONE LIKE YOU

18:53.666 --> 18:55.635
WHO TOOK THE TIME TO SUPPORT ME

18:55.668 --> 18:57.304
AND MAKE ME FEEL LESS ALONE.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.671
I OWE YOU ONE.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.540
YOU KNOW, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR,

19:00.573 --> 19:03.410
BECAUSE I SIGNED YOU UP TO SPEAK TO
A GROUP OF AT-RISK GIRLS TOMORROW.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.545
BEING A SEXUALLY ACTIVE TEEN
WHO'S HAD A CLOSE CALL,

19:05.578 --> 19:07.146
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
GET THROUGH TO THEM.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.748
NO, DIDN'T YOU HEAR?

19:08.781 --> 19:11.451
I'M NOT PREGNANT AT ALL.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.821
BUT YOU'RE STILL CARELESS.
YOU JUST GOT LUCKY.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.224
NO, I'M NOT LUCKY.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.825
I LIED TO GET OUT OF SOCCER.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.295
WELL, SCANLON,

19:22.329 --> 19:23.863
I HAVE TO SAY I FEEL

19:23.896 --> 19:26.666
DISAPPOINTED AND BETRAYED.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.835
BUT MOVING ON... YOUR NAME'S
ALREADY IN THE PROGRAM

19:28.868 --> 19:30.570
AND THEY'RE EXPECTING YOU.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.272
PLUS, THE POSTERS
ARE ALREADY UP.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.543
OH, THAT'S MY OLD YEARBOOK PHOTO

19:36.576 --> 19:39.512
WITH MY ZOMBIE EYES.
OH, WHAT HAVE I DONE?

19:39.546 --> 19:40.613
THAT'S THE LOOK WE WANT.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.415
REMEMBER IT FOR THE SPEECH.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.321
"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, MY DARLING.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.657
ALL MY LOVE, RUSSELL."

19:50.690 --> 19:52.559
OH, A DIAMOND BRACELET.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.861
DADDY WENT WITH THE BIG BLING.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.197
WOW, THAT'S LIKE A FIVE-FIGURE
APOLOGY RIGHT THERE, HUH?

19:58.231 --> 20:00.800
THAT'S LIKE A PRO
BASKETBALL PLAYER APOLOGY.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.337
HE'S FLYING IN TOMORROW
TO WHISK ME OFF TO PARIS.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.339
SUCK IT, YOGA GIRL.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.842
OH MY GOODNESS, I
HAVE TO GO PACK.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.344
I'VE GOT TO ADMIT, BURKE,

20:11.378 --> 20:12.812
I THINK FOR ONCE YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.748
I MEAN, THE DYSFUNCTION REALLY
SEEMS TO SUIT MONICA AND RUSSELL.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.750
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRIED TO
STICK MY NOSE IN THERE

20:17.784 --> 20:21.754
AND FIX WHAT ACTUALLY
WAS BROKEN VERY NICELY.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.657
WELL, ODDLY, IN THIS INSTANCE
YOU WERE ALSO RIGHT.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.793
I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.
GO ON.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.528
WELL, I USED THE POWER
OF REAL CONVERSATION...

20:28.561 --> 20:29.929
YOU KNOW, THAT THING
YOU'RE SO FOND OF.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.931
I CALLED RUSSELL'S
GIRLFRIEND AND TOLD HER

20:31.964 --> 20:33.933
THAT RUSSELL CAN'T GIVE
HER A BABY FOR REAL,

20:33.966 --> 20:36.769
BECAUSE OF THAT VASECTOMY
HE NEGLECTED TO MENTION.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.705
SO SHE KICKED HIM TO THE CURB
WHEN YOU SPILLED THE BEANS

20:38.738 --> 20:42.542
ABOUT RUSSELL'S... BEANS?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.911
YEAH, SO IF YOU WANT TO SAY,
"GOOD JOB, MEL," GO AHEAD.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.713
PRETTY GOOD, BURKE. I TELL YOU,

20:46.746 --> 20:48.881
YOU COULD ALMOST BE A LONGO.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.418
YEAH, AND IF YOU'D JUST SHUT UP ONCE
IN A WHILE, YOU COULD BE A BURKE.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.821
I COULD NEVER BE A BURKE.
MY LIVER COULDN'T TAKE IT.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.994
WELL, MOM, WHEN YOU GET TO
PARIS, SEND US SOME CROISSANTS.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.896
- YOU DON'T LIKE CROISSANTS.
- YES, I DO.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.732
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- I THINK I KNOW WHAT I LIKE.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.700
- YOU LIKE ECLAIRS.
- GO AWAY.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.603
- SEND US A BOX OF ECLAIRS.
- YES, DEAR.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.439
I'M SO GLAD YOU WORKED
THINGS OUT WITH DADDY.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.807
YOU ONLY GET ONE REAL
SOUL MATE IN LIFE.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.410
AND WHEN YOU FIND HIM,
YOU HOLD ONTO HIM.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.347
AND HE'S CLOSER THAN YOU THINK.
TA-TA.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.285
WHAT THE HELL IS
SHE TALKING ABOUT?

21:26.319 --> 21:29.356
WHO KNOWS? SHE HAD
A BIG BREAKFAST.
