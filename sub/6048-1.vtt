- Hey. Bob, what's up?
- <i>Hi. Listen.</i>

01:17.748 --> 01:21.149
<i>According to an unconfirmed
report, David Wallace is dead.</i>

01:21.151 --> 01:24.419
What? No. No, no, no.

01:24.421 --> 01:28.056
No, It must be some sort of a
college prank or something.

01:28.058 --> 01:33.127
<i>Well, I thought if anybody knew whether
it was true or not, it'd be you.</i>

01:36.866 --> 01:40.336
<i>Now a remembrance of writer
David Foster Wallace.</i>

01:40.338 --> 01:44.739
<i>He was found dead, an apparent
suicide, on Friday night.</i>

01:44.741 --> 01:47.809
<i>Wallace's novel,</i> Infinite
Jest, <i>brought him fame...</i>

01:47.811 --> 01:49.110
and a wide audience.

01:49.112 --> 01:51.678
Writer David Lipsky
has this appreciation.

01:54.984 --> 01:59.286
"To read David Foster Wallace was
to feel your eyelids pulled open."

02:00.821 --> 02:04.624
<i>Some writers specialize in the
'away from home' experience.</i>

02:04.626 --> 02:08.727
<i>They have safaried, eaten
across Italy, covered a war.</i>

02:10.229 --> 02:13.232
<i>Wallace offered his alive self,</i>

02:13.234 --> 02:15.234
<i>cutting through
our sleepy aquarium,</i>

02:15.236 --> 02:19.205
<i>our standard TV, stores,
political campaigns.</i>

02:21.474 --> 02:25.110
<i>Writers who can do this...
like Salinger and Fitzgerald...</i>

02:25.112 --> 02:27.880
<i>forge an unbreakable bond
with readers.</i>

02:27.882 --> 02:32.016
<i>You didn't slip into the books
looking for a story, information,</i>

02:32.018 --> 02:35.053
<i>but for a particular
experience...</i>

02:35.055 --> 02:38.222
<i>the sensation,
for a certain number of pages,</i>

02:38.224 --> 02:41.492
<i>"of being David Foster Wallace."</i>

02:45.897 --> 02:49.132
<i>If anything, there was
a conscious attempt...</i>

02:49.134 --> 02:51.701
<i>to not give overt direction,</i>

02:51.703 --> 02:54.304
<i>although, of course,
you end up becoming yourself.</i>

02:55.673 --> 02:57.640
<i>Did they want you
to be a writer or no?</i>

02:57.642 --> 02:59.909
<i>No. I was gonna be... The big
thing, when I was little...</i>

02:59.911 --> 03:02.478
<i>I was... I was, like, a
really serious jock. Really?</i>

03:02.480 --> 03:04.547
<i>Yeah. I played
citywide football as a kid.</i>

03:04.549 --> 03:07.616
<i>I was really big,
really strong as a kid.</i>

03:07.618 --> 03:10.987
<i>And then for four or five years, I was
gonna be, like, a pro tennis player.</i>

03:10.989 --> 03:12.922
<i>That was my great dream.</i>

03:12.924 --> 03:14.623
<i>Reading was just
this kind of fun,</i>

03:14.625 --> 03:17.326
<i>sort of weird thing
that I did on the side.</i>

03:26.302 --> 03:28.003
"I didn't understand SoHo..."

03:28.005 --> 03:32.206
the warehouses, the old
buildings, the cobbled streets.

03:32.208 --> 03:36.143
It wasn't the Upper East Side,
and it was dirty.

03:37.712 --> 03:39.212
I felt marooned.

03:39.214 --> 03:42.950
Our mother had taken us off the track
of the nice life we'd been on.

03:42.952 --> 03:46.054
She'd moored us in a creepy cul-de-sac
with her art-world friends.

03:46.056 --> 03:48.756
<i>None of the kids in my school
had parents in the art world.</i>

03:48.758 --> 03:50.657
<i>It made me feel different,</i>

03:50.659 --> 03:52.593
<i>like there was something
I had to cover up."</i>

03:54.296 --> 03:56.229
It was great.
Sorry I missed it.

03:56.231 --> 03:58.498
Don't worry about it.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.766
Hey. I heard you got
that <i> Rolling Stone</i> job.

04:00.768 --> 04:03.770
We'll see. I'm sort of on probation.
Good luck.

04:03.772 --> 04:06.372
Did you see Kirn's review
in <i> New York</i> magazine?

04:06.374 --> 04:08.640
The guy's been
fuckin' canonized.

04:08.642 --> 04:09.875
Sorry. Who's this?

04:09.877 --> 04:11.877
David Foster Wallace.

04:11.879 --> 04:14.346
"Next year's book awards have been
decided." Can you believe this?

04:14.348 --> 04:17.850
"The plaques and citations can now be
put into escrow." It's unbelievable.

04:17.851 --> 04:20.252
"With <i> Infinite Jest,</i>
by David Foster Wallace,

04:20.254 --> 04:24.723
a plutonium-dense, satirical quiz-kid opus
that runs to almost a thousand"... What?

04:24.725 --> 04:27.760
"A thousand pages,
not including footnotes,"

04:27.762 --> 04:29.561
the competition
has been obliterated.

04:29.563 --> 04:32.163
It's as though Paul Bunyan
had joined the NFL...

04:32.165 --> 04:34.166
or Wittgenstein
had gone onto <i> Jeopardy!.</i>

04:34.168 --> 04:37.335
"The novel is that colossally disruptive
and that spectacularly good."

04:37.337 --> 04:39.705
That's the fucking
opening paragraph.

04:39.707 --> 04:42.540
What if it actually
is that good?

04:43.542 --> 04:46.278
You might just have to read it.

04:57.557 --> 04:58.891
Shit.

04:58.893 --> 05:00.626
Good piece. Thanks a lot.

05:02.095 --> 05:03.830
Solid piece. I'm fine with it.

05:03.832 --> 05:06.033
But you gotta clear it
with Legal, okay?

05:08.267 --> 05:10.869
How many times have we interviewed
a writer in the last 10 years?

05:10.871 --> 05:13.705
Take a guess.

05:13.707 --> 05:15.039
Uh, how many?

05:15.041 --> 05:17.575
Zero. I checked.

05:17.577 --> 05:19.697
Maybe because <i> Rolling Stone</i>
doesn't interview writers.

05:20.678 --> 05:23.247
There hasn't been a writer
like this. Okay?

05:23.249 --> 05:26.650
Once in a generation maybe.
Hemingway, Pynchon.

05:26.652 --> 05:29.153
Let me have this story.
What story?

05:29.155 --> 05:32.222
He's finishing up a book tour,
and I want to go with him.

05:32.224 --> 05:33.857
That's not a story.

05:33.859 --> 05:37.393
He teaches at some small state
university somewhere in Illinois.

05:37.395 --> 05:39.361
Please, Bob. Send me there.

05:39.363 --> 05:43.332
This is the sort of stuff I should be
doing, not 500 words on boy bands.

05:44.967 --> 05:46.902
Talk to Jann.

05:59.550 --> 06:01.950
There better be a story there.

06:04.921 --> 06:07.422
There will be. There better.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.527
David, hi. It's David Lipsky.
<i>Where are you?</i>

07:42.529 --> 07:44.896
I think I may have made
a wrong turn somewhere.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.399
Let's see. I am on
County Highway 29...

07:47.401 --> 07:50.001
just across
from the Circus Video.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.937
<i>How'd you get this number?</i>

07:51.939 --> 07:55.640
Your publicist sent it
in her e-mail, just in case.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.777
<i>You'd do me a favor
by losing it.</i>

08:50.168 --> 08:52.936
Stay. Be calm. Be calm. Stay.

08:55.739 --> 08:58.241
Hey. You made it. Yeah.

08:58.243 --> 08:59.842
Dave. Dave Wallace.

08:59.844 --> 09:02.444
David Lipsky. Hi.
It's a pleasure.

09:02.446 --> 09:04.613
Likewise.

09:04.615 --> 09:07.048
Um, I'm sorry about
the, uh... the phone call.

09:07.050 --> 09:08.215
No, you're fine.

09:08.217 --> 09:12.119
It was 95% joke.
Right, right. Yeah.

09:12.121 --> 09:15.388
Sorry in advance about the dogs.
They'll be slobbering all over you.

09:15.390 --> 09:17.157
I don't mind at all.
I love dogs.

09:17.159 --> 09:20.293
Oh, yeah? You haven't met these guys yet.
No, I love 'em.

09:20.295 --> 09:23.697
Let's, uh... Oh, Jesus. Let's get inside.
It's cold.

09:23.699 --> 09:26.499
Boys. Get in there.
Thanks a lot.

09:26.501 --> 09:28.768
Ooh. Come on. Come on, buddy.

09:28.770 --> 09:30.903
Wait. I'm very glad to meet you too.
Good dog.

09:30.905 --> 09:33.506
Who's that? Oh, that's Jeeves.

09:33.508 --> 09:36.141
Hi. Yeah, that's
the Jeeve-meister.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.476
I got him 'cause he was so ugly.
Nobody else wanted him.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.145
Now he's, like,
a cover girl dog.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.480
And that's Drone.
That's my provisional dog.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.915
Why? Why provisional?

09:44.917 --> 09:47.285
He just showed up one day while
Jeeves and I were out jogging.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.887
The rest is history.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.757
I feel like I should
offer you tea or something.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.719
Yeah. Yeah, thanks. That'd be great.
Yeah? Okay.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.581
Nice view.

10:15.583 --> 10:18.983
Thank you. I can't
take credit for it.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.851
Huh.

10:23.555 --> 10:27.124
So, um, have you
always been unlisted?

10:28.427 --> 10:31.462
I had to do that recently. It
was getting kind of crazy.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.932
Oh. Because of...
Because of fans.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.467
I don't know if "fan" is
exactly the right word.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.138
I think what happened was I had forgotten to
tell my parents not to give my number out.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.707
So it was people who had
tracked my parents down.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.911
I have this terrible problem. I really
hate to hurt people's feelings.

10:45.913 --> 10:49.080
Mmm, right. So I did
somethin' kind of cowardly.

10:49.082 --> 10:53.118
No. I don't think unlisting your
number is cowardly. Kind of is.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.887
I changed my number so these
folks couldn't find me anymore.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.121
Right.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.557
There was this computer
operator from Vancouver.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.091
He was living in a
basement or something.

11:01.093 --> 11:04.894
I found him very moving. He was
in terrible, terrible pain.

11:04.896 --> 11:06.829
What did he want from you?

11:06.831 --> 11:09.799
It's unclear. And when I
would, sorta like, ask him,

11:09.801 --> 11:12.968
that's when he would get angry,
and then it got scary.

11:12.970 --> 11:16.338
Right. What-What is this?
Who's the artist?

11:17.673 --> 11:20.241
That's my friend's daughter.
Calls me chicken head.

11:20.243 --> 11:21.977
I call her chicken head.

11:21.979 --> 11:24.612
It's her latest salvo
in the war.

11:24.614 --> 11:27.849
Um, that's funny.
Would you mind if I...

11:27.851 --> 11:30.384
No. Do what you gotta do.
Thank you.

11:37.559 --> 11:42.429
Listen, before we start putting stuff
on tape, I need to ask you something.

11:42.431 --> 11:46.033
I need to know that anything that I
say five minutes later not to put in,

11:46.035 --> 11:48.301
that you're not
gonna put it in.

11:48.935 --> 11:50.936
Absolutely.

11:50.938 --> 11:54.040
Just given my level of fatigue
and my fuckup quotient lately,

11:54.042 --> 11:57.411
it's the only way I can see doin'
it and not... not going crazy.

11:57.413 --> 11:59.379
No. I completely understand.

12:01.349 --> 12:04.031
It's right back on, huh? Mmm.

12:05.118 --> 12:07.752
Uh, you agreed
to the interview.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.927
So this is your road, huh?

12:15.929 --> 12:17.762
Yeah, this is my road.

12:17.764 --> 12:20.464
You're gonna have to tell me where to turn.
I'm used to a grid system.

12:20.466 --> 12:22.300
This is all new
territory for me.

12:22.302 --> 12:25.436
Fair enough. You just go
straight for about a mile.

12:25.438 --> 12:27.539
There'll be signs for the
school on the right.

12:27.541 --> 12:30.308
Got it. Do you like
teaching there?

12:30.310 --> 12:33.645
I do. Yeah, very much.
Which is what's so fucked.

12:33.647 --> 12:36.481
I feel so bad for these kids.
Why do you feel bad for them?

12:36.483 --> 12:38.983
They have the greatest writing
teacher in the world.

12:38.985 --> 12:42.120
If I was there, maybe.
The whole fuss...

12:42.122 --> 12:43.688
it's taken me out of school
for the past two weeks.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.424
And we gotta leave
again tomorrow.

12:45.426 --> 12:48.093
We gotta be up at the crack
of dawn to go to the airport.

12:48.095 --> 12:51.196
Oh, shit. Do we really? That's
what you signed on for, man.

12:51.198 --> 12:53.532
You're welcome to stick around and
write an article about my dogs.

12:53.534 --> 12:56.868
No, that's just fine. Might be
more interesting. I promise you.

12:56.870 --> 12:59.938
Do yourself a favor. Don't
expect any fireworks in there.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.806
I'm sure you're gonna
be just fine.

13:01.808 --> 13:04.009
Campus-romance story.

13:04.011 --> 13:06.978
Ah! I gotta tell you guys,

13:06.980 --> 13:10.115
the average citizen is not gonna
find it that interesting.

13:10.117 --> 13:12.717
The great dread of creative
writing professors?

13:12.719 --> 13:17.355
"Their eyes met over the keg."

13:17.357 --> 13:19.757
I just want my narrator to be
funny and smart, you know?

13:19.759 --> 13:21.225
I know, I know. I get it.

13:21.227 --> 13:23.528
You want your narrator
to be funny and smart.

13:23.530 --> 13:25.096
Here's a tip.

13:25.098 --> 13:27.999
Have him say funny, smart things
some of the time.

13:28.001 --> 13:29.166
Thank you.

13:29.168 --> 13:30.700
You did a good job. Thank you.

13:30.702 --> 13:33.637
Um, all right, who's next?
Melissa.

13:33.639 --> 13:36.006
I'm normally a much better
teacher than that, I swear.

13:36.008 --> 13:38.575
I thought you were great and
that they obviously love you.

13:38.577 --> 13:39.944
Oh, yeah? Do you think?

13:39.946 --> 13:42.313
Yeah, come on,
you know they do.

13:42.315 --> 13:43.914
You hungry?

13:47.219 --> 13:48.852
<i>And what can I
get you to drink?</i>

13:48.854 --> 13:52.990
I'll just have, like, a
giant Diet Rite, please.

13:52.992 --> 13:54.925
You know what,
I'll have the same thing.

13:54.927 --> 13:58.129
I'll be right back with your pop.
Thanks, man.

13:59.598 --> 14:02.098
Oh. Uh, can I, uh...

14:03.968 --> 14:07.103
Do you mind if I... One second.

14:08.606 --> 14:12.107
Uh...

14:13.809 --> 14:15.944
You don't drink.

14:19.748 --> 14:21.549
Is that a question to me?

14:21.551 --> 14:23.817
No. No, it's an observation.

14:23.819 --> 14:27.221
Ah, I see. No, I know.
No, I do not drink.

14:27.223 --> 14:29.456
You can order whatever you want though.
Go right ahead.

14:29.458 --> 14:30.857
No, no. That's fine.

14:30.859 --> 14:33.760
I have a lot of friends who have
been through the program, so...

14:33.762 --> 14:36.129
They always tell me that
they're uncomfortable...

14:36.131 --> 14:38.564
with people drinking
right in front of them.

14:38.566 --> 14:40.433
So I just... Ah.

14:41.835 --> 14:46.272
I mean, out of respect, I...
I got what you got.

14:46.274 --> 14:50.742
I'm not any sort of authority
on any sort of program.

14:50.744 --> 14:53.212
From my very limited
outside understanding,

14:53.214 --> 14:55.214
for people who have been
in it a while,

14:55.216 --> 14:58.451
you could snort cocaine off the back
of your hand, they'd be all right.

14:58.453 --> 15:00.386
Right. Right. Right.

15:01.554 --> 15:03.556
You know what I would love to do, man?
What's that?

15:03.558 --> 15:07.192
I would love to do a profile on one of
you guys who's doin' a profile on me.

15:07.194 --> 15:09.495
That is interesting. Is
that too pomo and cute?

15:09.497 --> 15:10.996
Maybe for <i> Rolling Stone.</i>

15:10.998 --> 15:14.232
It would be interesting though.
You think?

15:14.234 --> 15:16.602
I'm sorry, man. What's wrong?

15:16.604 --> 15:19.871
It's just you're gonna go back to
New York and sit at your desk...

15:19.873 --> 15:22.708
and shape this thing
however you want.

15:22.710 --> 15:24.876
To me, it's just
extremely disturbing.

15:24.878 --> 15:26.711
Why is it disturbing?

15:26.713 --> 15:30.582
Because I think I would like to shape the
impression of me that's coming across.

15:30.584 --> 15:33.017
I don't even know
if I like you yet.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.420
I'm so nervous about
whether you like me.

15:35.422 --> 15:36.988
Here you go.

15:36.990 --> 15:38.856
Your food will be out soon.
Can I get you anything else?

15:38.858 --> 15:41.326
No, we're fine. Thank you.
Thanks.

15:41.328 --> 15:43.261
Um...

15:43.263 --> 15:45.697
What's this story about
in your mind?

15:45.699 --> 15:47.699
What does Jann want?

15:47.701 --> 15:50.268
Just what it's like to be the most
talked about writer in the country...

15:50.270 --> 15:53.038
or that sort of thing. Right.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.306
Which makes it sound...

15:55.308 --> 15:57.242
How do you learn
to do this stuff?

15:57.244 --> 15:59.944
Do what? The interviewing.

15:59.946 --> 16:02.079
Does one go
to interviewing school?

16:02.081 --> 16:04.549
Yes, I went to eight years
of interviewing school.

16:04.551 --> 16:06.083
So you got a master's? I did.

16:06.085 --> 16:10.588
Um, no. No, I'm... I'm a writer.

16:10.590 --> 16:12.690
Uh, okay. Great. Yeah.

16:12.692 --> 16:15.059
I mean I write fiction
as well. I...

16:16.195 --> 16:17.862
I just had a novel
published actually.

16:17.864 --> 16:20.531
Great. Yeah.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.133
What's... What's that called?

16:22.135 --> 16:24.935
<i>The Art Fair. The Art Fair.
</i> Great.

16:27.506 --> 16:30.975
And I had a collection
published a few years ago, so...

16:30.977 --> 16:32.810
You're, like,
a nervous guy, huh?

16:32.812 --> 16:36.080
No, no. No, I'm okay. How are you?
I... 'Cos I'm terrified.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.981
Are you? Yes. You're
not alone in this.

16:37.983 --> 16:39.550
Okay. We'll do this together.

16:39.552 --> 16:42.185
No, I think it's gonna
be a lot of fun. Yeah.

16:42.187 --> 16:44.687
The thing about the tour
is, yes,

16:44.689 --> 16:47.323
I would like to get laid
off of it a couple of times.

16:47.325 --> 16:49.858
People come up.
They kind of, like, slither up.

16:49.860 --> 16:52.027
And it seems like...
I don't know.

16:52.029 --> 16:54.295
What I want is not to have
to take any action.

16:54.297 --> 16:57.499
What kind of action? I don't
want to have to say, like,

16:57.501 --> 16:59.267
"Do you want to come
back to the hotel?"

16:59.269 --> 17:01.936
I want them to say, "I am
coming back to your hotel."

17:01.938 --> 17:05.473
"Where is your hotel?" That would
be easier for you, wouldn't it?

17:05.474 --> 17:08.509
I can't stand to look like I'm
actively trading off this sexually.

17:08.511 --> 17:10.845
Which, of course,
I'd be happy to do.

17:10.847 --> 17:13.347
I think, in retrospect, I'm
probably very lucky that I didn't.

17:13.348 --> 17:15.049
Lucky? Why?

17:15.050 --> 17:17.617
It just would have made me feel lonely.
You know?

17:17.619 --> 17:19.086
Lonely? How so?

17:19.088 --> 17:21.122
It wouldn't have had
anything to do with me.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.723
I think it would have
been... just...

17:23.726 --> 17:26.425
Your fame? Yeah. Whatever.

17:26.428 --> 17:27.961
Your fame. You can say it.
Fine, fine.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.296
You're famous. Okay, whatever.

17:30.298 --> 17:33.333
You are. Except, though, if they're
responding to your work...

17:33.335 --> 17:34.600
and your work
is really personal,

17:34.602 --> 17:36.969
then reading you is another
way of meeting you.

17:36.971 --> 17:38.870
Isn't that right?

17:38.872 --> 17:40.405
That's so good. Thank you.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.740
This piece will be excellent
if it's mostly you.

17:42.742 --> 17:45.376
Talk all you want, man. Save
me a whole lot of trouble.

17:54.485 --> 17:57.620
Wow! So this is what
a real car feels like.

17:57.622 --> 18:00.656
The one I got is like riding
around on a power lawn mower.

18:00.658 --> 18:02.691
You know?

18:02.693 --> 18:05.327
Do you think being handsome has
anything to do with your success?

18:06.862 --> 18:08.596
- What?
- No, you're photogenic.

18:08.598 --> 18:10.832
You look good in your author's photo.
Come on.

18:10.834 --> 18:15.070
You have to come put me down if
I even start thinking that way.

18:15.072 --> 18:17.572
Thinking what way? What,
about how books are sold?

18:17.574 --> 18:21.276
Like, "Do you want to do
a <i> Rolling Stone</i> interview?"

18:21.278 --> 18:24.045
Do you want to do X?
Do you want to do Y?

18:24.047 --> 18:28.417
It really worries me that what I'm
doing right now is like being a whore.

18:28.419 --> 18:30.652
A whore? Hey. Why?

18:30.654 --> 18:34.723
Cashing in somehow or like getting
some little celebrity for myself...

18:34.725 --> 18:38.593
that will, from some bizarre set of
misunderstandings, sell more copies of the book.

18:38.595 --> 18:42.064
- Mmm, okay.
- You can quote that if you want.

18:42.066 --> 18:44.733
Preferably in a context where I
don't sound like a total dweeb.

18:44.735 --> 18:47.069
Don't worry about it.

18:47.071 --> 18:50.539
By the way, are they gonna send
Annie Leibovitz to take pictures?

18:50.541 --> 18:54.075
I'm not sure. Possibly.
See how the story turns out.

18:56.244 --> 18:58.479
I know. You're a really
good-looking guy.

18:58.481 --> 19:01.215
We should have 'em photograph
you, say you're me.

19:01.217 --> 19:04.185
Maybe I'll finally end up
getting laid.

19:11.227 --> 19:12.727
You're gonna drink all that?

19:12.729 --> 19:15.130
I don't want to have to come back.
I wish they had a case.

19:15.132 --> 19:18.366
Actually,
that's a good idea. Um...

19:21.904 --> 19:23.804
Get the marshmallow one
too, please.

19:23.806 --> 19:26.173
All right. One?

19:26.175 --> 19:27.875
Two. Two. Of course.

19:27.877 --> 19:29.710
Why would I get one?
One second. Okay.

19:29.712 --> 19:32.112
Okay, all right. I think that's enough.
Come on.

19:32.114 --> 19:35.483
Hey, Kim. Hi. We'll
take all of these.

19:35.485 --> 19:38.552
- Please, let me.
- No, you don't have to pay for my shit.

19:38.554 --> 19:41.676
No, no. It's not coming out of my pocket.
I have an expense account.

19:42.958 --> 19:45.359
If you insist, yeah. Yeah.

19:53.002 --> 19:54.935
If we ate like this
all the time... Yeah?

19:54.937 --> 19:57.405
What would be wrong with that?
What would be wrong?

19:57.407 --> 19:59.540
Besides your teeth falling out
and getting really fat?

19:59.542 --> 20:01.441
It's got none of the
nourishment of real food,

20:01.443 --> 20:04.745
but it is real pleasurable masticating
and swallowing this stuff.

20:04.747 --> 20:06.780
Yes, it is. It's like seductive
commercial entertainment.

20:06.782 --> 20:10.017
Mmm, but what saves us is that most
entertainment is not very good.

20:10.019 --> 20:13.387
But what about good seductive commercial
entertainment like... like <i> Die Hard?</i>

20:13.389 --> 20:15.857
First <i> Die Hard?</i> Great film.
No, it's a brilliant film.

20:15.859 --> 20:18.659
The best. So good. Absolutely.

20:18.661 --> 20:21.529
I think, if the book
is about anything,

20:21.531 --> 20:24.498
it's about the question
of "Why?" Right.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.533
"Why am I watching
all this shit?"

20:26.535 --> 20:30.070
It's not about the shit. It's about me.
Right. Yeah.

20:30.072 --> 20:32.372
So why am I doing it?

20:32.374 --> 20:34.775
And what's so American
about what I'm doing?

20:36.744 --> 20:41.047
The minute I start talking about this
stuff, it sounds, number one, very vague,

20:41.049 --> 20:42.915
and number two,
really reductive.

20:42.917 --> 20:45.351
I don't think you're being
vague or reductive at all.

20:45.353 --> 20:48.220
Okay, because I don't have
a diagnosis...

20:48.222 --> 20:51.457
or a system of prescriptions
as to why we...

20:51.459 --> 20:54.092
When I say "we," I mean
people just like you and me...

20:54.094 --> 20:55.993
mostly white,
upper middle class,

20:55.995 --> 20:59.464
obscenely well educated,
doing really interesting jobs,

20:59.466 --> 21:02.733
sitting in really expensive
chairs watching the best,

21:02.735 --> 21:06.670
most sophisticated electronic
equipment money can buy.

21:06.672 --> 21:10.474
Why do we feel so empty
and unhappy?

21:10.476 --> 21:13.810
Right. It's kind of like Hamlet
except with channel surfing.

21:13.812 --> 21:16.814
I'm not saying that watching TV
is bad or a waste of your time...

21:16.816 --> 21:20.885
any more than, like, masturbation
is bad or a waste of your time.

21:20.887 --> 21:23.020
It's a pleasurable way
to spend a few minutes.

21:23.022 --> 21:24.855
But if you're doing it
20 times a day...

21:24.857 --> 21:27.758
if your primary sexual relationship
is with your own hand,

21:27.760 --> 21:28.658
something is wrong.

21:28.660 --> 21:30.993
Except at least
with masturbation,

21:30.995 --> 21:32.794
some action is being
performed, right?

21:32.796 --> 21:35.697
Isn't that... That's better.

21:35.699 --> 21:38.599
Okay, you could make me look like
a real dick if you print this.

21:38.601 --> 21:42.437
No, I'm not going to, but, if
you can, speak into the mike.

21:42.439 --> 21:46.141
Yes, you're performing muscular movements
with your hand as you're jerking off.

21:46.143 --> 21:48.143
But what you're really doing,
I think,

21:48.145 --> 21:50.813
is you're running a movie
in your head.

21:50.815 --> 21:54.349
You're having a fantasy relationship
with somebody who is not real...

21:54.351 --> 21:56.751
strictly to stimulate
a neurological response.

21:56.753 --> 22:00.222
So as the Internet grows
in the next 10, 15 years...

22:00.224 --> 22:04.026
and virtual reality pornography
becomes a reality,

22:04.028 --> 22:08.130
we're gonna have to develop some
real machinery inside our guts...

22:08.132 --> 22:10.133
to turn off
pure, unalloyed pleasure.

22:10.135 --> 22:14.036
Or, I don't know about you, I'm
gonna have to leave the planet.

22:14.038 --> 22:17.373
'Cause the technology is just
gonna get better and better.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.908
And it's gonna get
easier and easier...

22:19.910 --> 22:22.645
and more and more convenient
and more and more pleasurable...

22:22.647 --> 22:26.615
to sit alone
with images on a screen...

22:26.617 --> 22:29.318
given to us by people who do not
love us but want our money.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.354
And that's fine in low doses,

22:32.356 --> 22:34.857
but if it's the basic
main staple of your diet,

22:34.859 --> 22:36.458
you're gonna die.

22:37.293 --> 22:39.461
Well, come on.

22:39.463 --> 22:43.965
In a meaningful way,
you're going to die.

22:47.636 --> 22:51.006
Hey. Can I try that actually?

22:51.008 --> 22:54.842
Yeah. It takes some getting used to.
Go ahead.

22:54.844 --> 22:56.176
Thanks.

22:56.178 --> 22:57.980
It goes right there.
Yeah, I know.

23:01.015 --> 23:03.483
Mmm. That's, um...

23:05.752 --> 23:08.019
Actually, can I... Can I use
your bathroom for a second?

23:08.021 --> 23:09.721
I believe it's unoccupied.

23:18.464 --> 23:19.730
Mm!

24:00.077 --> 24:02.411
Hey. Hey.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.847
So, do you not
have a television?

24:05.849 --> 24:08.984
I do not have a TV, no.
How come?

24:08.986 --> 24:11.853
Because if I had a TV, I
would watch it all the time.

24:11.855 --> 24:14.255
Ah. I don't even know if I
would watch it all the time,

24:14.257 --> 24:16.124
but it would be on
all the time.

24:16.126 --> 24:19.427
My version of a fireplace... some sort
of source of warmth and light...

24:19.429 --> 24:21.830
in the corner, I'd
occasionally get sucked into.

24:21.832 --> 24:24.866
Did you watch a lot of TV
when you were a kid?

24:24.868 --> 24:27.336
Yeah, a lot. You?

24:27.338 --> 24:31.006
I, uh... Me? Yeah.
No, I did. I did.

24:32.776 --> 24:37.312
But I moved in with a woman, and
she grew up without a television.

24:37.314 --> 24:40.282
So living with her for the
first month was like torture.

24:40.284 --> 24:43.718
But then I realized it was
probably the best thing for me.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.955
Did you guys stay together?
It was complicated.

24:46.957 --> 24:48.957
Why?

24:48.959 --> 24:52.161
Well, I was seeing this woman,
and she moved to LA,

24:52.163 --> 24:55.831
so we theoretically broke up.

24:55.833 --> 24:58.167
Then I started seeing
this other woman.

24:58.169 --> 24:59.966
But then I started seeing
the first woman again.

24:59.992 --> 25:01.103
We tried the bi coastal thing.

25:01.105 --> 25:04.674
And let's just say the second woman
didn't take to that very well.

25:04.676 --> 25:07.009
It's so much easier
having dogs.

25:07.011 --> 25:08.644
I'm sure it is.

25:08.646 --> 25:11.179
Yes, you don't get laid, but
you don't have that feeling...

25:11.181 --> 25:13.481
like you're hurting their
feelings all the time.

25:13.483 --> 25:14.649
Right, right, right.

25:14.651 --> 25:16.450
I'd like to emphasize...

25:16.452 --> 25:19.486
strictly platonic relationship
with the dogs.

25:19.488 --> 25:22.690
I'll make sure to highlight
that in the article, sure.

25:22.692 --> 25:25.491
Uh, so, you're not
dating anybody then?

25:27.027 --> 25:29.261
Seriously dating?
No. I'm out of practice.

25:29.263 --> 25:30.929
I wouldn't even know
what to say.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.999
Do you want to have kids?

25:35.001 --> 25:38.369
I think someday I would.
You? Yeah.

25:38.371 --> 25:41.740
Yeah, I think, eventually. Yeah.

25:41.742 --> 25:45.344
I think that writing books is a
little bit like raising children.

25:45.346 --> 25:47.245
You have to be careful though.

25:47.247 --> 25:50.047
It's okay to take pride
in the work,

25:50.049 --> 25:53.985
but I think it's bad to want the
glory to reflect back on you.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.955
It sounds like you're worried
about having children.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.425
I don't know that I want to say
anything more about that.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.428
If that's okay. That's fine.

26:03.430 --> 26:06.431
It's fine for us to joke about
getting laid on tour and stuff,

26:06.433 --> 26:09.835
but that's... that's about it.

26:09.837 --> 26:12.771
I just thought it'd be nice
to have someone...

26:12.773 --> 26:14.673
to be sharing all this
wonderful stuff with.

26:14.675 --> 26:17.042
That's it. Yeah.

26:17.044 --> 26:20.979
I'd really wished that I was
married the past couple weeks.

26:20.981 --> 26:22.580
You have?

26:24.082 --> 26:27.018
Yeah. Nobody else
really gets it, you know?

26:27.020 --> 26:29.720
Your friends who aren't
in the writing biz are just...

26:29.722 --> 26:32.924
They're awed by
your picture in <i> Time.</i>

26:32.926 --> 26:34.859
Your agent and editor
are good people,

26:34.861 --> 26:37.628
but they have
their own agendas.

26:37.630 --> 26:41.366
It's fun talking to you about it,
but you've got your own agenda too.

26:41.368 --> 26:41.955
That's true.

26:41.981 --> 26:44.302
Certainly a set of interests
that diverge from mine.

26:44.304 --> 26:46.171
That's true.

26:46.173 --> 26:50.676
So, yeah, it would be nice to have
somebody that you shared a life with...

26:50.678 --> 26:55.079
and allowed yourself to be happy and...
confused with.

26:55.081 --> 26:57.715
Somebody to call when you
get back to the hotel.

27:00.685 --> 27:03.988
I got a question.
Why aren't you married, at 30?

27:05.657 --> 27:08.125
Why aren't you married, at 34?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.627
You first. Okay.

27:09.629 --> 27:12.730
Uh... I don't know.

27:12.732 --> 27:15.467
I just think it's hard to
cast that role, you know,

27:15.469 --> 27:19.938
to fill it when you know it's
gonna be like 30 to 40 years.

27:21.274 --> 27:23.708
To find someone who, whatever
mental landscape you're in,

27:23.710 --> 27:25.376
they're gonna be in it too.

27:25.378 --> 27:29.280
You have to find someone who will
fit any landscape you can imagine.

27:29.282 --> 27:30.614
I don't know.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.984
I can't put it
as well as you can,

27:32.986 --> 27:35.853
you know, about
these mental landscapes.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.857
I just... I know that
I'm hard to be around.

27:38.859 --> 27:41.326
- No, I don't think so.
- I am.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.060
Why do you say that?

27:45.631 --> 27:47.965
When I want to be alone,
like, to write,

27:47.967 --> 27:49.766
I really do want to be alone.

27:49.768 --> 27:53.203
I think if you dedicate
yourself to anything,

27:53.205 --> 27:56.674
one facet of that is that it makes
you very, very self-conscious.

27:56.676 --> 27:59.309
And you end up using people...

27:59.311 --> 28:01.811
wanting them around
when you want them around...

28:01.813 --> 28:03.079
and then sending them away.

28:03.081 --> 28:05.214
But that comes
with the territory...

28:05.216 --> 28:08.383
if you're gonna be a writer...
that kind of self-consciousness.

28:08.385 --> 28:09.852
There's good self-consciousness.

28:09.854 --> 28:13.388
Then there's also
a toxic, paralyzing,

28:13.390 --> 28:16.992
"raped by psychic bedouins" kind
of self-consciousness. Right.

28:16.994 --> 28:19.627
That is scary.
Yeah, that sounds worse.

28:19.629 --> 28:23.311
Can you do me a favor? Could you tell
me about that poster over there?

28:24.333 --> 28:28.070
Alanis? Yeah.

28:28.072 --> 28:31.139
I don't know. I guess I'm susceptible
like everybody else. Why?

28:31.141 --> 28:34.843
I mean, she's pretty, but
it's the only thing in there.

28:34.845 --> 28:38.346
She's pretty in a very sloppy,
very human way.

28:38.348 --> 28:42.650
She's got this squeaky,
orgasmic quality to her voice.

28:43.518 --> 28:46.053
You know, here's what it is.

28:46.055 --> 28:49.389
A lot of women in magazines are
pretty in a way that is not erotic...

28:49.391 --> 28:51.925
because they don't look like
anybody that you know.

28:51.927 --> 28:53.526
That's true.

28:53.528 --> 28:56.830
You can't imagine them putting a
quarter in a parking meter...

28:56.832 --> 28:58.798
or, like, eating
a bologna sandwich.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.833
Whereas, Alanis Morissette,

29:00.835 --> 29:05.672
I can and have imagined her just, like,
chowing down on a bologna sandwich.

29:05.674 --> 29:09.243
I find her absolutely riveting. -Nice. How did you
get into her? How did you get into her music?

29:09.245 --> 29:12.045
I was listening to this
cheesy Bloomington radio,

29:12.047 --> 29:13.980
and "I Want to Tell You"
came on.

29:13.982 --> 29:16.650
"You Oughta Know." But right.

29:16.652 --> 29:18.318
I don't know what that means.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.055
<i>I Want to Tell You</i> is a book
that O.J. Simpson wrote.

29:21.057 --> 29:24.658
Ah! That's a different thing.
Yeah.

29:24.660 --> 29:27.628
Although, wouldn't it be funny if O.J.
Simpson sang "You Oughta Know"...

29:27.630 --> 29:30.263
and Alanis Morissette wrote a book
about not killing two people?

29:30.265 --> 29:33.200
Oh, man.

29:33.202 --> 29:35.635
I tell you, if this whole
fuss, whatever,

29:35.637 --> 29:38.905
could get me a five-minute
cup of tea with her...

29:38.907 --> 29:41.240
Yo. Why don't you
put out feelers...

29:41.242 --> 29:43.275
and see if she'd be
willing to meet you?

29:43.277 --> 29:46.312
Are you serious? I would never do that.
Why not?

29:46.314 --> 29:49.148
I would be terrified.
Why, would you do that?

29:49.150 --> 29:51.951
If I were you, yeah,
I would do that.

29:51.953 --> 29:54.787
A date with Alanis Morissette?
What would I say?

29:54.789 --> 29:58.657
"Hello, Miss Morissette.
What is it like to be you?"

29:58.659 --> 30:00.291
"I don't know.

30:00.293 --> 30:02.694
Shut up and get
the fuck away from me."

30:02.696 --> 30:04.230
That's that beautiful
squeaky voice you like.

30:04.256 --> 30:05.163
That's right. And orgasmic.

30:05.165 --> 30:06.964
But you would go
if she called you.

30:06.966 --> 30:09.600
"Hey, Dave, I'm at the Drake
in Chicago. Let's have tea."

30:09.602 --> 30:11.702
This is gonna look ridiculous.

30:11.704 --> 30:14.271
It's gonna look like
I'm using <i> Rolling Stone...</i>

30:14.273 --> 30:15.806
as a vehicle to, like...

30:15.808 --> 30:18.241
- It's been used for worse.
- Yes, I would do it.

30:18.243 --> 30:20.944
Okay? I would do it in a heartbeat.
Good.

30:20.946 --> 30:24.380
Perspiring heavily
the whole way,

30:24.382 --> 30:26.850
the whole time shoving Certs
into my mouth. Exactly.

30:26.852 --> 30:30.119
Freaking out. It would cause me
a week of absolute trauma.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.889
And, yes, I would do it
in a... in a heartbeat.

30:32.891 --> 30:34.724
Okay? Are you happy?
We got that?

30:34.726 --> 30:36.358
It's on the record. Okay.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.228
Um...

30:39.230 --> 30:40.829
I like... Eh.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.935
I like talking to you
about this stuff.

30:46.937 --> 30:49.203
But we should...
We gotta be up early.

30:49.205 --> 30:51.172
Really? What time is it?
It's, like, 10:00.

30:51.174 --> 30:53.807
I think it's, like, 11:30,
dick brain.

30:53.809 --> 30:58.612
Oh, shit. Jesus. I am so sorry.

30:58.614 --> 31:00.180
I totally lost track of time.

31:00.182 --> 31:02.750
What time do you want me
to pick you up tomorrow?

31:02.752 --> 31:04.384
Where you going?

31:04.386 --> 31:06.352
There's a motel down the road.
I think it's a Days Inn.

31:06.354 --> 31:09.489
Oh, no, you don't want
to stay there. Trust me.

31:11.959 --> 31:15.395
I got a guest-roomish place
you could stay in.

31:15.397 --> 31:16.996
No, I don't want to impose.

31:16.998 --> 31:19.031
Don't thank me. It's not much.

31:19.033 --> 31:20.867
Okay.

31:22.469 --> 31:24.670
No, it's great. Thank you.

31:24.672 --> 31:26.539
I should probably clean some
of that shit off the bed.

31:26.541 --> 31:28.340
Right. Maximum comfort.

31:28.342 --> 31:29.641
Thanks.

31:29.643 --> 31:31.909
Definitely want
to change that sheet.

31:31.911 --> 31:34.712
No, it's fine. Thank you.

31:34.714 --> 31:37.314
Just throw it wherever.
Okay. Here you go.

31:38.316 --> 31:40.117
Grab one side of this.
All right, thanks.

31:40.119 --> 31:43.620
And you want to change the
pillows or just keep them?

31:43.622 --> 31:47.124
I don't think you're going
to catch anything incurable.

31:47.126 --> 31:50.394
That's all right.
I got penicillin.

31:50.396 --> 31:52.295
Okay. You're good? Yeah.

31:52.297 --> 31:54.830
Do me a favor. Leave the
door open for the dogs.

31:54.832 --> 31:56.532
They like to wander
from room to room at night.

31:56.534 --> 31:59.134
If the door's closed, they'll eat it
to get through it if they have to.

31:59.136 --> 32:01.236
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

32:01.238 --> 32:04.907
Okay, yeah. Okay. Good night.

32:04.909 --> 32:07.429
Good night. Thanks. Cool.

32:44.686 --> 32:47.421
Oh. All right.

32:50.859 --> 32:54.494
Hey, buddy. Okay. How are ya?

32:54.496 --> 32:57.865
Okay. Hey. Oh. All right.

32:57.867 --> 33:00.567
Psst! Okay.

33:02.738 --> 33:05.571
All right. Thanks. Okay.

33:07.106 --> 33:10.242
All right. Okay.
Have a good night.

33:13.812 --> 33:15.446
Okay.

33:38.302 --> 33:40.336
Oh. Hey.

33:41.938 --> 33:43.705
If you want any,
there's coffee.

33:43.707 --> 33:45.628
I don't need caffeine
to wake up.

33:47.009 --> 33:50.177
Oh, but, uh, cigarettes?

33:50.179 --> 33:52.461
Brothers of the lung. Mmm.

33:54.448 --> 33:57.083
Do you want to split this with me?
It's my last one.

33:58.518 --> 34:01.019
Uh, no, thanks.

34:07.526 --> 34:09.094
Just... Here.

34:10.795 --> 34:14.666
<i>Mi</i> Pop-Tart <i> es su</i> Pop-Tart.

34:14.668 --> 34:17.534
Thanks. Try it.

34:17.536 --> 34:19.069
It's delicious, right?

34:19.071 --> 34:22.139
It's really good.

34:40.226 --> 34:42.159
There's a Mitsubishi plant.

34:42.161 --> 34:43.728
Then there's a lot
of farm support.

34:43.730 --> 34:46.465
There's Ro-Tech,
Anderson Seeds.

34:46.467 --> 34:49.768
What are you doing here? I mean,
why are you not in New York?

34:49.770 --> 34:54.005
Every time I go to New York,
I get caught up in this...

34:54.007 --> 34:58.711
There's this enormous hiss of egos at
various states of inflation and deflation.

35:00.081 --> 35:04.150
Yeah. Hey, um, sorry.
I gotta do this.

35:04.152 --> 35:06.252
Okay.

35:06.254 --> 35:09.522
So, I gotta ask.
What is with the bandanna?

35:10.757 --> 35:12.591
What? What do you mean?

35:12.593 --> 35:17.028
No, people think it's your way of
connecting to a younger reading audience.

35:18.263 --> 35:20.130
Is that what people think?

35:20.133 --> 35:23.000
I don't see many Gen Xers
wearing them. Geez.

35:23.002 --> 35:25.068
I kinda wish you hadn't
brought this up, man.

35:25.070 --> 35:27.738
I'm sorry about that. Why?

35:27.740 --> 35:30.574
Because now I'm worried
it's going to seem intentional.

35:30.576 --> 35:32.643
Like, if I don't wear it,
am I not wearing it...

35:32.645 --> 35:35.712
because I'm bowing to other people's
perception that it's a commercial choice?

35:35.714 --> 35:38.549
Or do I do what I wanna do even though
it's perceived as a commercial choice?

35:38.551 --> 35:41.818
It's like a whole crazy circle
I gotta go around in now.

35:41.820 --> 35:43.753
Come on. Sorry.

35:43.755 --> 35:46.389
When did you start
wearing them?

35:46.391 --> 35:48.991
In Tucson. It was, like,
a hundred degrees all the time.

35:48.993 --> 35:52.628
I would perspire so heavily, drip
into the electric typewriter.

35:52.630 --> 35:55.297
I was nervous I was gonna
give myself a shock.

35:55.299 --> 35:59.435
And then, at some point, I realized
I felt better with them on.

36:00.970 --> 36:03.939
I know that it's a security blanket
for me whenever I feel nervous...

36:03.941 --> 36:07.375
or, like, I gotta
keep myself together.

36:07.377 --> 36:10.045
Makes me feel kind of creepy,
people view it as an affectation...

36:10.047 --> 36:11.279
or a trademark or something.

36:11.281 --> 36:13.147
It's more of a foible,

36:13.149 --> 36:16.251
the recognition of a weakness that I'm
kind of afraid my head is gonna explode.

36:16.253 --> 36:17.785
Right.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.292
Your parents are both academics.
Is that right?

36:26.161 --> 36:28.795
My dad, philosophy.
My mom, English.

36:28.797 --> 36:30.863
So. You?

36:30.865 --> 36:33.466
Me? Yeah.

36:33.468 --> 36:37.203
My dad is in advertising,
and my mom's a painter.

36:37.205 --> 36:40.207
When they split up, I moved
in with her to SoHo,

36:40.209 --> 36:41.541
and my brother
moved in with my dad.

36:41.543 --> 36:43.843
Sounds like
there's a story there.

36:43.845 --> 36:46.646
Oh, there is.
I... I just wrote it.

36:46.648 --> 36:50.417
What was it like, you know, growing
up in a house divided like that?

36:50.419 --> 36:53.787
Hey. Who's interviewing who?

36:57.559 --> 37:00.460
How old were you when you
started writing fiction?

37:00.462 --> 37:02.129
Like, 21. Something like that.

37:02.131 --> 37:03.964
Really? Never before?

37:03.966 --> 37:07.000
I think I started a World War
II novel when I was nine.

37:07.002 --> 37:09.436
Did you? That's very ambitious.
Thank you.

37:09.438 --> 37:12.605
It was so good, some of my best work.
Come on.

37:12.607 --> 37:15.275
It was about people with
hyper developed skills and powers...

37:15.277 --> 37:17.510
going to invade Hitler's bunker.

37:17.512 --> 37:18.878
Very nice.

37:18.880 --> 37:22.315
Then, in college, I wrote a couple
of papers for other people.

37:22.317 --> 37:25.397
Really? People paid you to
write their papers for them?

37:26.453 --> 37:28.854
I wouldn't put it that coarsely.
How would you...

37:28.856 --> 37:32.024
There was a complicated
system of rewards. I see.

37:32.026 --> 37:33.725
I would read two or three
of their papers...

37:33.727 --> 37:35.793
and get a sense of what
their music was like.

37:35.795 --> 37:38.563
At some point, I realized
I'm really good at this.

37:38.565 --> 37:41.165
I'm like a strange kind
of forger.

37:41.167 --> 37:43.200
I can sort of sound
like anybody.

37:43.202 --> 37:46.137
It's kind of scary. Um...

37:46.139 --> 37:48.772
Odds are I'm gonna want
to interview your parents.

37:51.009 --> 37:53.744
What for? Just
biographical stuff.

37:53.746 --> 37:55.345
Right.

37:56.448 --> 37:58.715
I hereby request
that you don't.

37:58.717 --> 38:01.551
Really? They're very
private people.

38:01.553 --> 38:04.922
And so I would have a problem with that.
Mmm, okay.

38:04.924 --> 38:07.124
So, no, you may not.

38:08.260 --> 38:10.861
Okay. I may not.

38:17.835 --> 38:21.338
<i>Now boarding,
Flight 54 to Minneapolis.</i>

38:23.374 --> 38:25.655
Ticket. Thank you.

38:30.614 --> 38:33.216
Crap jobs? Oh, man.

38:33.218 --> 38:37.386
I was a security guard at a software
company for three and a half months.

38:37.388 --> 38:41.557
Really? I walked around in
this polyester uniform...

38:41.559 --> 38:44.427
under these fluorescent
lights, twirling a baton,

38:44.429 --> 38:46.862
checking in on the walkie
every 10 minutes.

38:46.864 --> 38:48.630
"All clear at this cubicle."

38:48.632 --> 38:52.101
It was like every bad '60s novel
about meaningless authority.

38:52.103 --> 38:55.771
You're thinking, "My God, I had two books
come out in my early 20s, and here I am."

38:55.773 --> 38:59.509
No. No, as a matter of fact, one of
the things I liked about that job...

38:59.511 --> 39:01.911
is that I walked around not thinking.
Really?

39:01.913 --> 39:06.616
Mmm, in a very, like, "Huh. A
ceiling tile" sort of way.

39:06.618 --> 39:08.578
And what about after the
security guard thing?

39:08.604 --> 39:09.620
Was there anything else?

39:09.622 --> 39:11.788
Oh, this is the worst. What?

39:11.790 --> 39:13.656
Get this down. I am.

39:13.658 --> 39:16.005
I was a towel boy at
this chichi health club.

39:16.031 --> 39:17.127
You were a towel boy?

39:17.129 --> 39:18.736
I was called something
other than a towel boy.

39:18.762 --> 39:19.796
I was, in effect, a towel boy.

39:19.798 --> 39:22.595
Occasionally trusted
with checking people in.

39:22.621 --> 39:23.567
"Show your ID."

39:23.569 --> 39:25.502
Anyway, one day
I'm sitting there.

39:25.504 --> 39:27.838
Who should walk in to get
their towel but this guy,

39:27.840 --> 39:31.674
this writer that I knew who won a Whiting
writer's award the same year I had.

39:31.676 --> 39:33.176
Oh, God. Yeah.

39:33.178 --> 39:35.578
So there I am.
I'm sitting there.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.780
I'd been on a rostrum with
this guy... Holy shit.

39:37.782 --> 39:40.049
Having Eudora Welty
give us an award.

39:40.051 --> 39:42.117
Two years later,
I'm sitting there...

39:42.119 --> 39:45.354
It's the first time I remember ever
actively diving under something...

39:45.356 --> 39:46.855
to have somebody
avoid seeing me.

39:46.857 --> 39:48.690
You dove under a table?
Something like that.

39:48.692 --> 39:52.361
Did you think you were done? I thought
life was over. I was pretty sure.

39:52.363 --> 39:54.483
And was this after
your suicide watch?

39:57.700 --> 40:01.135
Okay, how do you
know about that?

40:01.137 --> 40:03.738
I... I read about it somewhere.

40:03.740 --> 40:07.007
This was McLean's, right?
How long were you there?

40:07.009 --> 40:10.544
I was there for eight days.
And why were you there?

40:10.546 --> 40:13.680
Because I was probably afraid
that I would do something stupid.

40:13.682 --> 40:15.281
Okay.

40:18.018 --> 40:20.920
I had a friend in high school
who tried to kill himself...

40:20.922 --> 40:23.289
by sitting in a garage
with the car running.

40:23.291 --> 40:25.090
And what it turned out was
he didn't die.

40:25.092 --> 40:27.026
It just really
fucked up his brain.

40:27.028 --> 40:28.994
And I, you know...

40:28.996 --> 40:32.665
I knew that if anyone was fated to
fuck up a suicide attempt, it was me.

40:32.667 --> 40:35.267
So there you are.
You're still in your 20s.

40:35.269 --> 40:37.435
My late 20s.
Okay, your late 20s.

40:37.437 --> 40:39.905
And you're in
some kind of pain...

40:39.907 --> 40:42.841
about your desire to become some
sort of successful literary person.

40:42.843 --> 40:46.478
I think that the not very sophisticated
diagnosis is that I was depressed.

40:47.213 --> 40:48.980
Okay.

40:48.982 --> 40:53.451
Okay. At that point, my ego was
all tied up in my writing.

40:53.453 --> 40:56.221
It's the only thing
that I'd gotten any, like,

40:56.223 --> 40:58.823
food pellets
from the universe for.

40:58.825 --> 41:00.791
And I felt very trapped.

41:00.793 --> 41:03.461
"Oh, my five years are up
and I gotta move on.

41:03.463 --> 41:06.063
I don't want to move on."

41:06.065 --> 41:07.831
And I felt stuck.

41:09.601 --> 41:12.302
And it's not like I felt stuck
because I drank, okay?

41:12.304 --> 41:17.006
It was like I felt
my life was over at 28,

41:17.008 --> 41:19.008
and I felt really bad.

41:20.444 --> 41:23.012
I did not want to feel that,
so I did all sorts of stuff.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.080
I would drink real heavy.

41:25.082 --> 41:28.084
I would... fuck strangers.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.953
Sometimes I would not drink at all,
not drink at all for two weeks.

41:30.955 --> 41:35.090
Instead, I would run 10 miles
every morning in a desperate...

41:37.461 --> 41:40.129
like, a very American...

41:40.131 --> 41:45.068
"I will fix this somehow by taking
radical action" sort of thing.

41:48.338 --> 41:51.107
And here you are promoting
this acclaimed book.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.875
That's not bad.

41:58.348 --> 42:01.383
David, this is nice.

42:01.385 --> 42:03.486
This is not real.

42:12.529 --> 42:14.531
By the way, an escort is
supposed to pick me up...

42:14.533 --> 42:16.966
and escort me to the reading.

42:16.968 --> 42:20.537
Of course, when I hear "escort," I
picture, like, full geisha and hair...

42:20.539 --> 42:22.138
Of course, right.

42:22.140 --> 42:24.907
Take you to the bookstore and
take you back to the hotel,

42:24.909 --> 42:27.911
walk on your back and then
just fuck your eyeballs out.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.680
I think that's her.
Ah, just as I pictured.

42:30.682 --> 42:33.417
Mr. Wallace. Just "Dave."

42:33.419 --> 42:36.253
I recognize you from
your photograph. Okay.

42:36.255 --> 42:37.654
I'm Patty Gundersson.

42:37.656 --> 42:39.723
And welcome to Minneapolis.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.492
Thank you, Patty. Hi. I'm David Lipsky.
How are you?

42:42.494 --> 42:45.229
Hi. Okay. David and David.
That's easy.

42:45.231 --> 42:47.731
- It's the Twin Cities, so...
- Hmm.

42:47.733 --> 42:50.367
We only just met. He's
writing a piece on the tour.

42:50.369 --> 42:54.637
- Should we get going?
- Yes. Come on. Come on. Great.

42:54.639 --> 42:56.573
How's your morning, Patty?
Oh, it's good.

42:56.575 --> 42:58.675
How about you guys?
Was the flight all right?

43:05.283 --> 43:09.619
You would not believe the
famous people I've driven.

43:09.621 --> 43:12.421
Shirley MacLaine when she
was on her book tour.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.291
Ron Wood, you know,
of the Rolling Stones.

43:15.293 --> 43:16.692
Of course. Yeah. Wow.

43:16.694 --> 43:19.728
Peter O'Toole. Oh, my gosh.

43:19.730 --> 43:21.664
Very thin, but delightful.

43:21.666 --> 43:23.532
Hey! Look, there's the
Mary Tyler Moore statue.

43:23.534 --> 43:25.233
Yeah, there it is.

43:25.235 --> 43:26.635
Did you want to stop?

43:26.637 --> 43:28.770
Oh. No, it's fine.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.538
Thank you. Are you sure?

43:30.540 --> 43:33.775
Everybody who comes here, that's
the first thing they want to see.

43:33.777 --> 43:37.078
"Where did Mary Tyler Moore
throw her hat up in the air?"

43:37.080 --> 43:38.780
It's really one of our
biggest attractions.

43:38.782 --> 43:40.681
Are you sure you don't
want me to stop?

43:40.683 --> 43:44.919
Definitely. No.
Thank you though.

43:44.921 --> 43:47.221
Trust me. This is about
as sexy as the tour gets.

43:48.457 --> 43:50.391
Mr... Uh, Lipsky.

43:50.393 --> 43:53.293
L-I-P-S-K-Y.

43:53.295 --> 43:55.328
I've got you
in a standard double.

43:55.330 --> 43:57.864
And Mr. Wallace? Yes.

43:57.866 --> 43:59.866
You have a room with twins.

43:59.868 --> 44:03.169
Ah, yes. Anita and Consuela.

44:04.371 --> 44:05.838
Excuse me?

44:10.143 --> 44:12.377
All right, man. I'll see you soon.
I'm gonna take a nap.

44:12.379 --> 44:14.847
Oh. Uh...

44:16.015 --> 44:17.415
Yeah.

44:17.417 --> 44:19.617
<i>What does he say
about the heroin rumors?</i>

44:19.619 --> 44:21.553
I haven't gotten to that.

44:21.555 --> 44:23.288
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

44:23.290 --> 44:26.558
What am I supposed to say? "Is it
true you were a heroin addict?"

44:26.560 --> 44:28.660
<i>Yes. That's your story.</i>

44:28.662 --> 44:31.062
Okay, well, that's... It's hard.

44:31.064 --> 44:34.766
<i>Why, because you like him?
</i> Yeah. Yes.

44:34.768 --> 44:37.135
<i>David, you gotta press him.
</i> Okay.

44:37.137 --> 44:39.838
<i>Be a prick if you have to. You're
not his best buddy.</i> I know.

44:39.840 --> 44:42.001
<i>You're a reporter.</i>
All right. Bye.

44:52.884 --> 44:54.784
It's right up here.

44:57.488 --> 44:59.087
Ready?

45:01.891 --> 45:04.692
- Ah!
- There he is.

45:04.694 --> 45:05.926
I can't believe
you guys actually came.

45:05.928 --> 45:08.229
Yeah, of course. Hi. Hi.

45:08.231 --> 45:09.964
Wouldn't miss it. Hello.

45:09.966 --> 45:12.499
Gluttons for punishment, both of you.
I know.

45:12.501 --> 45:16.370
Uh, this is Dave Lipsky. He's a
reporter from <i> Rolling Stone.</i>

45:16.372 --> 45:18.205
Yes. Hi. Oh.

45:18.207 --> 45:20.274
This is Julie. Hi. Nice
to meet you, Julie.

45:20.276 --> 45:22.142
Great to meet you.

45:22.144 --> 45:23.743
And, uh... This is Betsy.

45:23.745 --> 45:25.578
Betsy and I went
to grad school together.

45:25.580 --> 45:27.547
How nice. Nice to
meet you, Betsy.

45:27.549 --> 45:29.282
And, Julie, how do you...

45:29.284 --> 45:31.818
Julie... Here, turn this on.
This is on, right?

45:31.820 --> 45:33.686
It is. Why? Go ahead.
Do you wanna...

45:33.688 --> 45:36.422
I'll do it. Julie wrote
me a fan letter.

45:36.424 --> 45:37.891
Really? Mm-hmm.

45:37.893 --> 45:40.326
I really did. I... Yeah.

45:40.328 --> 45:43.228
I was the books editor at <i> City
Pages,</i> and I wrote him a fan letter.

45:43.230 --> 45:45.364
Julie's worked with
a whole lot of writers.

45:45.366 --> 45:47.632
So I was very discriminating.

45:47.634 --> 45:50.402
And then it turned out that we
actually like each other as people.

45:50.404 --> 45:53.271
Indeed. That's actually what
happened with Jon Franzen and me.

45:53.273 --> 45:56.174
I wrote him a fan letter. Turns
out writers are real pushovers...

45:56.176 --> 45:57.875
when it comes to flattery.

45:57.877 --> 45:59.476
So you could try that sometime.

45:59.478 --> 46:01.712
I got it. Very subtle.

46:01.714 --> 46:05.115
Friends of friends who
have friends, as well,

46:05.117 --> 46:06.983
who actually know who... Cookies?

46:06.985 --> 46:09.553
Oh, no. Thanks a lot.
Oh, no. Thank you.

46:09.555 --> 46:10.954
Cookies?

46:10.956 --> 46:14.391
Really? Yes, and I've actually
been sworn to secrecy.

46:14.393 --> 46:17.593
Are you sure I can't get
you something to drink?

46:18.595 --> 46:20.697
Do you have any artificial spit?

46:20.699 --> 46:23.866
I don't know why
you guys are laughing.

46:23.868 --> 46:25.969
It's an actual
pharmaceutical product.

46:25.971 --> 46:28.638
Called Xero-Lube. It's
like artificial saliva?

46:28.640 --> 46:30.306
That's right. That's right, David.
Really?

46:30.308 --> 46:32.942
Except it's better because
it actually lubricates.

46:32.944 --> 46:35.244
You don't get that, like...

46:35.246 --> 46:37.112
I see. That clicky sound.

46:37.114 --> 46:39.315
Could you do that for <i> Rolling Stone?
</i> Here you go.

46:39.317 --> 46:42.217
I'll have to remember that.

46:42.219 --> 46:45.054
It's all right. Next tour,
I'll bring myself a case.

46:45.056 --> 46:47.456
In the meantime,
what can I get you?

46:47.458 --> 46:49.157
Just water with no ice, please.

46:49.159 --> 46:52.895
Are you a fiction wri... This
is off the record. Oh, good.

46:52.897 --> 46:55.230
Are you a fiction writer?
I'm a poet actually.

46:55.232 --> 46:58.400
Really? Could I have
seen anything of yours?

46:58.402 --> 47:00.835
I just had my first poem
published in <i> The Kenyon Review.</i>

47:00.837 --> 47:04.539
Really? Wow. Congratulations.
Yes. Thank you.

47:08.877 --> 47:11.144
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be a prima donna,

47:11.146 --> 47:13.513
but do you mind if we
don't do a Q and A?

47:13.515 --> 47:16.583
Yeah, of course. Whatever makes
you feel most comfortable.

47:16.585 --> 47:18.117
Thank you. Sure.

47:18.119 --> 47:21.287
It's always questions like,
"Where do you get your ideas?"

47:21.289 --> 47:25.089
I don't know. From a Time-Life
subscription series for 17.95 a month.

47:25.091 --> 47:27.992
Okay. Now, it's show time.
Okay.

47:29.461 --> 47:31.328
Here we go. Yeah.

47:31.330 --> 47:33.631
It's all downhill from here.
It's fine.

47:33.633 --> 47:37.167
This is the very last stop
on his book tour,

47:37.169 --> 47:39.436
and we're very lucky
to get him.

47:39.438 --> 47:42.372
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to The Hungry Mind,

47:42.374 --> 47:44.308
David Foster Wallace.

47:52.818 --> 47:55.921
Hello. Hi. Hi.

47:55.923 --> 47:57.889
No, I never show
my mother anything.

47:57.891 --> 47:59.690
Now I feel embarrassed
that I said that.

47:59.692 --> 48:01.759
But that's very sweet.
It is, right?

48:01.761 --> 48:03.794
What's that supposed
to be, a computer?

48:03.796 --> 48:06.963
No, that's a smiley face.
Oh. Right.

48:06.965 --> 48:08.699
I could put white-out
on it if you want.

48:08.701 --> 48:11.434
That's okay. It's your book.
Okay.

48:12.869 --> 48:15.972
Oh, man. This old thing.
Do you mind?

48:15.974 --> 48:18.441
I don't mind, but the
new one's a lot better.

48:19.276 --> 48:20.410
Awesome.

48:20.412 --> 48:23.812
I just realized that they...
they want me to be good.

48:24.613 --> 48:26.414
You know what I mean?

48:26.416 --> 48:29.383
It's just something about,
like, giving back.

48:29.385 --> 48:31.017
You know, in that way.

48:31.019 --> 48:33.820
That made me feel kind of
better about everything.

48:33.822 --> 48:36.656
Please, give us the... It's
not... There's no story.

48:36.658 --> 48:39.693
How did it happen then? Okay.

48:39.695 --> 48:41.327
I couldn't be regular
old Dave Wallace...

48:41.329 --> 48:43.429
'cause there were Dave
Wallaces all over the place.

48:43.431 --> 48:45.490
And David Rains Wallace
wrote for the New Yorker.

48:45.516 --> 48:46.766
I don't know if you remember.

48:46.768 --> 48:49.135
So then, one day... It
was Fred Hill asked me,

48:49.137 --> 48:52.572
"What's your middle name?" Dave
Foster Wallace. That's it.

48:52.574 --> 48:54.440
That's your story? Yes.

48:54.442 --> 48:56.976
That is literally the worst superhero
origin story I've ever heard.

48:56.978 --> 48:59.611
I cannot claim that it
was an origin story.

48:59.613 --> 49:03.248
Dave, remember in Tucson that professor
you kind of locked horns with?

49:03.250 --> 49:06.484
Oh, man. My nemesis, who shall
remain nameless. Oh, come on.

49:06.486 --> 49:09.330
I was just kind of a prick.
I think he was too.

49:09.356 --> 49:10.455
I was unteachable.

49:10.457 --> 49:13.459
I don't think I was actively
unpleasant in class.

49:13.461 --> 49:15.527
You were pretty unpleasant.

49:15.529 --> 49:17.061
Okay, Betsy. Betsy. Really.

49:17.063 --> 49:19.096
Oh, I loved it. I loved it.

49:19.098 --> 49:22.033
Betsy, this is... She loved it.

49:22.035 --> 49:24.001
He was pleasantly unpleasant.

49:24.003 --> 49:26.637
That's a great quote, if you
want to quote something.

49:26.639 --> 49:28.805
I'm gonna have to interview
the teacher as well though.

49:28.807 --> 49:31.775
Hmm.

49:31.777 --> 49:34.944
I have to be up unconscionably early
for this public radio interview,

49:34.946 --> 49:36.078
so we should probably
get going.

49:36.080 --> 49:37.847
That means I have
to get up early too.

49:37.849 --> 49:41.116
You can do whatever the fuck you want.
You know?

49:41.118 --> 49:43.752
You can sleep in
if you want to.

49:43.754 --> 49:46.988
Well, we'll get you back
to the hotel then.

49:46.990 --> 49:48.789
Check. You know what,
I will get the check.

49:48.791 --> 49:51.859
I'll get it. Please,
this one is on me.

49:51.861 --> 49:54.027
Well, it's on Jann.
No, no. It's on me.

49:54.029 --> 49:55.763
Jann? Jann's his boss.

49:55.765 --> 49:58.532
No, this one is on me. It was
just so nice to meet you guys.

49:58.534 --> 50:00.367
Mr.<i> Rolling Stone.</i> Yeah.

50:24.859 --> 50:26.626
Can you close the window?
It's fucking freezing.

50:26.628 --> 50:30.996
No, sorry, I cannot. This is our
hypothermia smoking tour of the Midwest.

50:30.998 --> 50:34.567
Hypothermia smoking tour.
I love that.

50:34.569 --> 50:37.437
- Oh, thank you.
- Sounds like something Dave would say.

50:37.439 --> 50:38.971
Doesn't it?

50:50.783 --> 50:53.150
Thanks, ladies. Yeah, sure.

50:53.152 --> 50:55.887
Yeah, thank you so much. Sure.
What are you doing tomorrow?

50:55.889 --> 50:58.889
Oh. I'm not sure yet.

50:59.957 --> 51:01.959
Well, give us a call if you want.
We're here.

51:01.961 --> 51:03.393
Okay. Will do.

51:03.395 --> 51:05.395
Thanks again for coming.
Thank you so much.

51:05.397 --> 51:07.163
Nice to meet you, Julie.

51:07.165 --> 51:09.332
Bye, Betsy. Bye. Bye, David.

51:18.041 --> 51:21.210
That was fun.
Yeah, it was nice.

51:21.212 --> 51:23.292
All right, I'm hungry. Still?

51:24.580 --> 51:27.015
Yeah, it's terrifying
when it's happening.

51:27.017 --> 51:29.784
Really? How does it
feel though?

51:29.786 --> 51:33.087
People fighting to get in. A big line
of people wanting to impress you.

51:34.622 --> 51:36.889
I tell you what. I think
that having an audience...

51:36.891 --> 51:38.825
like, really,
really pretty girls...

51:38.827 --> 51:42.662
who are all paying attention to you
and kind of like what you're saying,

51:42.664 --> 51:47.834
that's gratifying on a fairly, I
think, just simple mammal level.

51:47.836 --> 51:50.704
I know. Why is that?

51:50.706 --> 51:54.007
I think pretty girls are what we most
dream and despair of ever having,

51:54.009 --> 51:56.343
like, pay attention to us.

51:56.345 --> 52:00.146
There they are in the front
row making eyes at you.

52:00.148 --> 52:02.582
I think my girlfriend
is in love with you.

52:04.217 --> 52:06.518
Come on. No, she's not.
No, really.

52:06.520 --> 52:08.020
I think she is.

52:08.022 --> 52:10.318
I think she likes your
writing better than mine.

52:10.344 --> 52:11.490
That's kind of annoying.

52:11.492 --> 52:15.527
Let's get her on the phone.
Get her on the phone. What?

52:15.529 --> 52:17.095
No.

52:18.597 --> 52:21.299
No. I don't know. She's...

52:21.301 --> 52:23.934
She's probably sleeping anyway.

52:26.405 --> 52:27.571
Please.

52:29.408 --> 52:31.107
<i>Hello?</i> Hi.

52:31.109 --> 52:34.344
<i>How's it going?</i> It's,
uh... Did I wake you up?

52:34.346 --> 52:37.246
<i>No. I'm up reading</i>
Infinite Jest.

52:37.248 --> 52:39.549
<i>Pretty amazing.</i> Oh. Good.

52:39.551 --> 52:42.118
Listen, I'm here with somebody
who wants to talk to you.

52:42.120 --> 52:44.855
Can you hold on a second?
What's her name again?

52:44.857 --> 52:47.018
It's Sarah. Yeah. Sarah.

52:48.158 --> 52:50.059
Sarah, hi. It's Dave Wallace.

52:50.061 --> 52:51.360
<i>Nice to meet you telephonically.</i>

52:51.362 --> 52:53.261
It's nice to meet you
telephonically as well.

52:53.263 --> 52:56.898
<i>Is David behaving himself?</i>
Let me ask him.

52:56.900 --> 52:59.000
Are you behaving yourself?

52:59.002 --> 53:01.002
She's asking that?

53:03.107 --> 53:05.273
I'm reasonably sure that he is.

53:05.275 --> 53:07.576
I don't have eyes on him 24-7.

53:07.578 --> 53:09.210
Sarah? Okay.

53:09.212 --> 53:11.278
What are you doin' tonight?
Don't ask her that.

53:11.280 --> 53:15.315
Oh, wow. You're kidding me. Oh, my gosh.
<i>Yes. It's awesome.</i>

53:15.317 --> 53:17.083
What part are you on?

53:17.085 --> 53:19.986
<i>369.</i> Wow, you're
really far along.

53:19.988 --> 53:22.254
<i>I know. I can't put it down.
</i> Oh, thank you.

53:22.256 --> 53:27.059
<i>Really, thank</i> you. I mean,
that's very flattering.

53:27.061 --> 53:29.261
What the fuck was that about?
<i>What?</i>

53:29.263 --> 53:30.996
You were on the phone with him
for half an hour.

53:30.998 --> 53:34.533
<i>It wasn't a half hour.</i> It was. It
was 25 minutes. Okay? I timed it.

53:34.535 --> 53:36.401
You were only supposed
to say hello.

53:53.421 --> 53:56.957
- David?
- David, we gotta go.

53:56.959 --> 53:59.459
Uh, the escort's waiting.

54:01.529 --> 54:03.863
Hey. Sorry.

54:03.865 --> 54:07.968
I got totally, like, sucked
in with this orgy of crap.

54:07.970 --> 54:12.138
There's a simultaneous broadcast of <i> Falcon
Crest, Magnum P.I.</i> and <i> Charlie's Angels.</i>

54:12.140 --> 54:14.274
Okay. A perfect storm of shit.

54:14.276 --> 54:16.756
I'll be out in a second, okay?
Okay.

54:39.266 --> 54:41.834
<i>Call now to order and get
this free workout video...</i>

54:41.836 --> 54:45.138
<i>with complete instructions
and 16 ab-work exercises.</i>

54:45.140 --> 54:48.774
<i>Plus my 20-minute aerobic workout.
That's everything you need.</i>

54:50.377 --> 54:51.977
Here, go in. Can you go around?

54:51.979 --> 54:53.511
Yeah, yeah. Sure. Thanks.

54:59.018 --> 55:01.252
You're wearing that?

55:03.788 --> 55:07.123
For a radio interview? Uh, yes.

55:14.032 --> 55:17.233
Hi. Dave. Dave Wallace.

55:17.235 --> 55:20.036
I know who you are.

55:20.038 --> 55:22.505
My amanuensis... Mr. Boswell.

55:22.507 --> 55:24.773
- Mr. Boswell.
- Very clever. Hi.

55:24.775 --> 55:26.375
Right this way.

55:29.645 --> 55:32.581
We record digitally.
I hope that's okay.

55:32.583 --> 55:36.084
So just yes or no answers?

55:36.086 --> 55:37.486
That's very funny. Hey.

55:37.488 --> 55:40.355
What? Hey. You do a really
mean job with this,

55:40.357 --> 55:42.690
Yeah? I got, like, 20
years to get you back.

55:42.692 --> 55:44.092
You remember that.
You're gonna be fine.

55:44.094 --> 55:46.661
My guest today
is David Foster Wallace,

55:46.663 --> 55:49.297
who has burst on
the literary scene...

55:49.299 --> 55:52.366
with his 1,079-page,

55:52.368 --> 55:55.969
three-pound, three-ounce novel,

55:55.971 --> 55:58.137
<i>Infinite Jest.</i>

55:58.139 --> 56:02.141
Jay Mclnerney called it "something
like a sleek Vonnegut chassis..."

56:02.143 --> 56:04.642
wrapped in layers
of post-millennial Zola."

56:06.111 --> 56:08.079
David Foster Wallace,
welcome to our show.

56:08.081 --> 56:10.014
Thank you. I'm glad to be here.

56:10.016 --> 56:14.585
All right. Now, you have said
you saw yourself as, quote,

56:14.587 --> 56:19.123
"a combination of being incredibly
shy and being an egomaniac too."

56:19.125 --> 56:22.092
I believe I said
"exhibitionist" also.

56:22.094 --> 56:23.860
Meaning?

56:23.862 --> 56:26.163
I think being shy basically
means being self-absorbed...

56:26.165 --> 56:29.766
to the extent that it makes it
difficult to be around other people.

56:29.768 --> 56:31.769
Difficult for you or difficult
for the other people?

56:31.771 --> 56:35.339
Ah. I suppose
a little bit of both.

56:35.341 --> 56:37.775
That was wonderful. Oh, yeah?

56:37.777 --> 56:42.078
I listened to the whole show.
It was so interesting. Thanks.

56:42.080 --> 56:44.448
I may have to buy your
book and read it.

56:44.450 --> 56:46.650
- Uh, sorry about that.
- Oh, no!

56:46.652 --> 56:49.387
Wasn't he wonderful?
He was wonderful.

56:49.389 --> 56:52.323
Oh, my gosh. So, you have
the rest of the day free.

56:52.325 --> 56:54.558
Where would you like to go?

56:54.560 --> 56:56.160
Yeah.

56:56.162 --> 56:58.428
Do you know where
the Mall of America is?

56:58.430 --> 57:00.663
Yes, I do. Great.

57:00.665 --> 57:02.766
Yes, I do. Yeah.

57:09.675 --> 57:12.609
I wanted to write something
that had the sort of texture...

57:12.611 --> 57:14.545
of what American life
is like now.

57:14.547 --> 57:16.914
- This tsunami of stuff just comin' at you.
- Right.

57:16.916 --> 57:20.151
Also, it's not unfun, I don't think.
No. I don't think so either.

57:20.153 --> 57:23.354
No. Not at all. I mean, although it
is, uh... it is sort of heavy though.

57:23.356 --> 57:25.523
Right? Weight-wise at least.

57:25.525 --> 57:28.626
My friend said, when it hit his porch,
it sounded like a car bomb going off.

57:28.628 --> 57:31.496
Right. Exactly. And... And who
do you think your readers are?

57:31.498 --> 57:33.431
Are they, uh...
Are they college kids?

57:33.433 --> 57:36.500
The people who seem most
enthusiastic are young men.

57:36.502 --> 57:39.270
Which I guess I understand.
It's a fairly male book.

57:39.272 --> 57:42.439
It's a fairly nerdy book, too,
about loneliness.

57:42.441 --> 57:45.309
You also can expect that someone who's
willing to read... and read hard...

57:45.311 --> 57:48.378
a thousand-page book is gonna be
someone with some loneliness issues.

57:48.380 --> 57:50.748
Right.

57:52.016 --> 57:54.450
So, is that what you think
the book is about then?

57:54.452 --> 57:56.586
About loneliness?

57:59.690 --> 58:03.026
I think that if there's a sort
of sadness for people under 45,

58:03.028 --> 58:07.331
it has something to do with pleasure
and achievement and entertainment.

58:07.333 --> 58:10.534
Like a sort of emptiness at the heart
of what they thought was going on,

58:10.536 --> 58:13.571
and maybe I can hope
that some parts of the book...

58:13.573 --> 58:16.206
speak to their nerve endings
a little bit. Mm-hmm.

58:16.208 --> 58:19.577
If you quote any of this, by the way,
you'd do me a great favor by saying...

58:19.579 --> 58:21.345
this is what I hope
for the book, you know.

58:21.347 --> 58:24.247
This is what the book is trying to achieve.
I don't pretend that it has.

58:24.249 --> 58:27.150
That's... That's fine. Um...

58:27.152 --> 58:30.219
So the Walter Kirn review in, uh,
<i>New York</i> magazine. Did you...

58:30.221 --> 58:33.423
I heard about it. I didn't read it.
You didn't read it.

58:33.425 --> 58:37.127
"Next year's book awards have been
decided." How do you feel about that?

58:37.129 --> 58:40.130
How do I feel about it? I applaud
his taste and discernment.

58:40.132 --> 58:42.765
What do you want me to say?
How would you feel about it?

58:43.834 --> 58:46.335
How would I feel?

58:46.337 --> 58:52.875
That something that I had known was really
good was now being validated by somebody else.

58:52.877 --> 58:57.780
All I know is this is absolutely the
best I could do between 1992 and 1995.

58:57.782 --> 58:59.915
If everybody had hated it,
I wouldn't have been thrilled.

58:59.917 --> 59:03.419
I don't think I would have
been devastated either.

59:03.421 --> 59:06.555
When you're used to doing heavy-duty
literary stuff that doesn't sell well,

59:06.557 --> 59:10.759
being human animals with egos, you accommodate
that fact by the following equation.

59:10.761 --> 59:13.596
If something sells really well,
gets a lot of attention,

59:13.598 --> 59:15.799
it's gotta be shit, right?
Right. Of course.

59:15.800 --> 59:18.066
The ultimate irony is, if your
thing starts selling well,

59:18.068 --> 59:19.601
gets a lot of attention,

59:19.603 --> 59:21.603
the very mechanism
you used to shore yourself up...

59:21.605 --> 59:23.471
when your thing didn't sell
well... Doesn't work anymore.

59:23.473 --> 59:26.975
It's now part of the darkness nexus when
it does, so you're totally screwed.

59:26.977 --> 59:28.710
You know, you can't win.

59:31.014 --> 59:33.215
I don't really see how they
could've gotten lost. Right.

59:33.217 --> 59:35.568
I mean, it's a straight shot.
Yeah. Of course.

59:35.594 --> 59:37.220
Right, just past the food court.

59:37.222 --> 59:40.623
Yeah. Through the amusement park.
Through the first lobster.

59:40.625 --> 59:43.026
Yeah. Don't go to the aquarium.
Turn right.

59:43.028 --> 59:46.428
Do not... If you see fudge,
you've gone too far.

59:46.430 --> 59:49.165
Hey! Hello.

59:49.167 --> 59:50.799
Aw. Hey!

59:53.035 --> 59:55.704
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

59:55.706 --> 59:57.472
Nice to see you. Thanks
for driving up here.

59:57.474 --> 59:58.806
Yes. You love it, I know it.

59:58.808 --> 01:00:00.808
Nice to see you. Hello, Betsy.
Great. How are you?

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:03.077
What's <i> The Juror?</i>

01:00:03.079 --> 01:00:07.014
Oh, that's a Demi Moore,
John Grisham movie. Yeah.

01:00:07.016 --> 01:00:08.315
<i>Happy Gilmore?</i> No.

01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:09.983
That's, uh, what? Adam Sandier.

01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:12.151
Right. What about,
uh, <i>Broken Arrow?</i>

01:00:12.153 --> 01:00:15.555
It's a dumb boy movie. Stuff blows up.
I've actually seen that.

01:00:15.557 --> 01:00:17.089
You saw that already?
I did actually.

01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:18.623
Wow, a man after my own heart.

01:00:18.625 --> 01:00:21.193
But I would be happy to see
it again if you want to.

01:00:21.195 --> 01:00:22.994
Nah. We can really
see anything.

01:00:35.774 --> 01:00:38.009
Oh, man.

01:00:58.332 --> 01:00:59.999
No.

01:01:01.502 --> 01:01:02.568
Yes.

01:01:11.311 --> 01:01:13.179
It's fantastic.

01:01:13.181 --> 01:01:15.548
- Horrible.
- You have got to be kidding me.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:19.052
That was the worst... The end, when
Travolta got impaled by the thing?

01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:22.255
The worst movie I've ever seen.
He-He saved humanity, Betsy.

01:01:22.257 --> 01:01:23.990
No, he did not. Have a heart.

01:01:23.992 --> 01:01:25.625
He made it worse.
You've changed.

01:01:25.627 --> 01:01:27.827
He made it worse.
What do we do now?

01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:31.331
Do you have a TV? Uh-huh. I do.

01:01:31.333 --> 01:01:33.966
<i>Oh, God. You know what I mean.
Who knows? Okay.</i>

01:01:33.968 --> 01:01:36.234
<i>I guess, you know. Oh, gotta hand
you, that show the other day.</i>

01:01:36.236 --> 01:01:38.103
<i>With Sandra Bernhard?
Ah, Jesus Christ!</i>

01:01:38.105 --> 01:01:39.804
I know that guy actually.

01:01:39.806 --> 01:01:42.473
Wh-Which one? The one
playing Letterman.

01:01:42.475 --> 01:01:43.875
Really? You do?

01:01:43.877 --> 01:01:45.910
How? We went to
Amherst together.

01:01:45.912 --> 01:01:46.844
No. Yeah.

01:01:46.846 --> 01:01:48.378
Was he a friend of yours?

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.080
I hated his guts so much.

01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:51.581
Of course you did. Right.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.649
Hey, wait. Does anyone
want drinks or anything?

01:01:53.651 --> 01:01:55.385
No. No? Okay.

01:01:55.387 --> 01:01:59.155
- But, um, there's also beer in the fridge.
- Soda's fine. Thank you.

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:03.559
- Why did you hate him?
- Pretty simple recipe.

01:02:03.561 --> 01:02:05.827
He was, like, very cool and popular.
Mm-hmm.

01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:09.731
And I was not. That was the basic offense.
Look at him now.

01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:14.836
Hey. Hey.

01:02:14.838 --> 01:02:16.737
Ah, I brought you something.

01:02:16.739 --> 01:02:18.371
You brought me something?

01:02:18.373 --> 01:02:19.940
Yeah. What is this?

01:02:19.942 --> 01:02:21.875
Oh, my God. This is the, uh...

01:02:21.877 --> 01:02:23.810
This is the <i> Review,</i> where
you have your poem in it.

01:02:23.812 --> 01:02:25.174
Somewhere in there.
That's amazing.

01:02:25.679 --> 01:02:27.079
What's on next?

01:02:27.081 --> 01:02:31.050
<i>Algiers,</i> starring Hedy Lamarr.
Have you seen that?

01:02:31.052 --> 01:02:35.187
Um, no. It's one of the greats.
And Hedy Lamarr is fascinating.

01:02:35.189 --> 01:02:38.024
She invented, uh... She
invented frequency hopping.

01:02:38.692 --> 01:02:40.259
No, she didn't. Yeah.

01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:41.860
I will. I definitely will.

01:02:41.862 --> 01:02:43.128
Um...

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.263
Hey, I was wondering.
When I get back to New York,

01:02:45.265 --> 01:02:48.165
if I have any questions about what Dave
was like in grad school or something,

01:02:48.167 --> 01:02:51.736
can I e-mail you?
Sure, if it's okay with Dave.

01:02:51.738 --> 01:02:53.370
I'm sure it's fine with Dave.

01:02:53.372 --> 01:02:57.108
That's great. So can I take your
e-mail address then? Sure. Uh, yeah.

01:02:57.976 --> 01:03:00.010
Oh, that'd be great. Thank you.

01:03:00.012 --> 01:03:03.948
You could just write it
on your book.

01:03:09.755 --> 01:03:11.422
Thank you so much.
Can you read that?

01:03:11.424 --> 01:03:15.526
I can see that it is letters. But,
no, I'll be fine. Thank you so much.

01:03:15.528 --> 01:03:17.127
Sure.

01:03:21.332 --> 01:03:23.366
- So, do you drink out of the tap?
- Yes.

01:03:23.368 --> 01:03:25.135
Okay, great.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.407
What are you...
What are you doing?

01:03:31.409 --> 01:03:32.875
What?

01:03:32.877 --> 01:03:36.211
I saw you hitting on Betsy.

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:40.316
Hitting on... I was...
I was talking to her.

01:03:40.318 --> 01:03:43.453
David. I saw you.

01:03:43.455 --> 01:03:46.189
You got her to give you
her address.

01:03:46.191 --> 01:03:49.459
No, no, no. I got her to
give me her e-mail address.

01:03:49.461 --> 01:03:52.528
In case I had questions about the
piece that I am writing about you.

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.029
Really? Okay. Yeah, really.

01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:56.832
Well, I'll tell you what. What?

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.400
I don't want her
talking to you.

01:03:58.402 --> 01:04:00.068
- I won't contact her.
- Look...

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:03.038
I told you that Betsy and I
dated during grad school.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.360
The least... Look at me. The least
you could... No, you're not.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.344
The least you could do
is show me the respect...

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:13.681
of not coming on to her
right in front of me.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:18.686
Dave, I'm sorry if it looked that way.
That was not my intention.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:22.222
And why would I want to get involved
with somebody who lives in Saint Paul?

01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:28.261
I don't know. You're already involved
with somebody who lives in Los Angeles.

01:04:30.397 --> 01:04:31.598
Okay.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.700
Are you okay?

01:04:33.702 --> 01:04:35.668
Yeah, everything's fine.
Thank you.

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:37.337
Okay.

01:04:38.339 --> 01:04:40.839
Stay away from her, okay?

01:04:43.076 --> 01:04:45.410
Be a good guy.

01:04:50.316 --> 01:04:52.116
What'd I miss?

01:04:52.118 --> 01:04:56.420
Everything. Nothing. Everything? That
seems like a gross exaggeration.

01:05:16.408 --> 01:05:20.111
<i>No. No! No!</i>

01:05:20.113 --> 01:05:23.880
<i>No! No! No!</i>

01:05:24.983 --> 01:05:26.550
<i>No!</i>

01:05:57.818 --> 01:06:00.319
9.50, please.

01:06:00.321 --> 01:06:03.990
I got it. It's all right. My
expense account will pay for it.

01:06:03.992 --> 01:06:06.860
Yeah, so will mine.
I said I got it.

01:06:09.063 --> 01:06:10.797
Thank you.

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:52.473
Hey, um...

01:06:53.641 --> 01:06:55.609
Good night.

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.918
<i>Were you flirting?</i> Sarah. Of
course I was not flirting.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.753
He just... He went
completely crazy on me.

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.523
<i>Well, you do that, David, you know?
You're not even aware of it.</i>

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:11.359
Sorry, I do... What do I do?
<i>You're compulsively flirtatious.</i>

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.195
Okay. Well, now you're
taking his side.

01:07:13.197 --> 01:07:16.765
<i>I am not.</i> Yes, you are.
Listen, I...

01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:19.401
I think I'm just
really tired, okay?

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:22.503
I gotta go.

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:23.971
<i>David?</i>

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:27.008
<i>David?</i>

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:38.520
Good morning!

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:41.155
Hi.
And how are we this morning?

01:07:43.592 --> 01:07:45.225
Think I'll sit up front.

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:49.529
Oh. Okay. Let me just,
um, move my stuff.

01:07:51.231 --> 01:07:53.031
There you go.

01:09:44.522 --> 01:09:46.689
Okay.

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.426
What?

01:09:51.429 --> 01:09:54.029
You didn't think to write
down where we parked the car?

01:09:54.031 --> 01:09:56.432
No. I didn't. Okay?

01:09:56.434 --> 01:09:58.967
Sorry. I fucked up. All right?
I'm a fuckup.

01:09:58.969 --> 01:10:01.337
Not everybody can be
as brilliant as you.

01:10:01.339 --> 01:10:04.306
What is with you? What
the fuck is with you?

01:10:18.454 --> 01:10:21.055
I gotta say,
there's something...

01:10:21.057 --> 01:10:24.538
basically false about
your approach here.

01:10:25.426 --> 01:10:28.194
What do you mean "false"?
Yeah, I think it's, uh...

01:10:28.196 --> 01:10:31.764
I think it's part of your
whole social strategy.

01:10:31.766 --> 01:10:34.366
In what way?

01:10:34.368 --> 01:10:37.803
You still feel you're
smarter than other people.

01:10:37.805 --> 01:10:39.371
Oh, really? Yeah, yeah.

01:10:39.373 --> 01:10:41.606
But you act like you're
in a kids' softball game,

01:10:41.608 --> 01:10:44.042
but holding back his power-hitting to
try and make it more competitive...

01:10:44.044 --> 01:10:45.543
for the little ones, you know?

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:48.880
When? Here. Now. The
past three days.

01:10:48.882 --> 01:10:51.249
It's part of your
social strategy.

01:10:52.718 --> 01:10:55.087
You're a tough room, you know that?
It's so obvious,

01:10:55.089 --> 01:10:59.123
the way you hold back your intelligence
to be with people who are, uh,

01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:01.192
younger than you
or not as agile as you.

01:11:01.194 --> 01:11:04.034
That would make me a real
asshole, wouldn't it? Well.

01:11:04.829 --> 01:11:07.598
I don't think writers
are smarter than other people.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.701
I think they may be more
compelling in their stupidity.

01:11:10.703 --> 01:11:12.370
Or in their confusion.

01:11:12.372 --> 01:11:14.638
But I think one of the real ways
I have gotten smarter...

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.873
is I don't think I'm that much
smarter than other people.

01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:18.442
That's right.

01:11:18.444 --> 01:11:20.977
There are ways in which other
people are a lot smarter than me.

01:11:20.979 --> 01:11:23.646
And I gotta tell you, it...

01:11:23.648 --> 01:11:25.849
It makes me feel kinda lonely.
What?

01:11:25.851 --> 01:11:28.751
There's been certain stuff I've
told you that's been really true.

01:11:28.753 --> 01:11:31.154
- I think it's been brave of me.
- No, no, no. Absolutely.

01:11:31.156 --> 01:11:33.022
I've written enough
of these pieces to know...

01:11:33.024 --> 01:11:35.557
you can write this up a hundred
different ways. You're right.

01:11:35.559 --> 01:11:38.561
Ninety of which I'm gonna come
across as a monumental asshole.

01:11:38.563 --> 01:11:41.230
And now it seems to me
like your read on this is,

01:11:41.232 --> 01:11:44.500
"Wow. What an interesting
persona Dave is adopting...

01:11:44.502 --> 01:11:46.869
- "for the purposes of this interview."
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

01:11:46.871 --> 01:11:51.540
If we had done this by the mail, if I had access
to my library, if I could look stuff up...

01:11:51.542 --> 01:11:54.443
My dream for this would be for you
to write it up, send it to me...

01:11:54.445 --> 01:11:55.911
- and let me rewrite all my quotes.
- Right.

01:11:55.913 --> 01:11:58.346
Which, of course, you'll never do.
But if I'm in a room...

01:11:58.348 --> 01:12:01.516
by myself, alone, and I have
time, I can be really smart.

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:03.535
Yes, I think I'm bright.
I think I'm talented.

01:12:03.561 --> 01:12:05.252
I'm not trying to
sound disingenuous...

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.421
- Oh, no?
- I am not an idiot.

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:10.223
Yes, I can talk intelligently
with you about stuff,

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:12.559
but I can't quite
keep up with you.

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:14.360
- Okay. That is such bullshit.
- Oh, believe me.

01:12:14.362 --> 01:12:17.563
I am not doing some
sorta like, "Aw, shucks."

01:12:17.565 --> 01:12:19.666
I'm just in from the country.
I'm not a real writer.

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:22.168
"I'm a regular guy" thing. I'm not
trying to lay some shit on you.

01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:25.805
But you did it again though. You flatter
me, but you're just patronizing.

01:12:25.807 --> 01:12:27.740
I just think that to look
across the room...

01:12:27.742 --> 01:12:30.810
and to automatically assume
that somebody is less aware...

01:12:30.812 --> 01:12:34.980
or that their interior life is
somehow less rich and complicated...

01:12:34.982 --> 01:12:39.285
and acutely perceived as mine,
makes me not as good a writer.
Why?

01:12:39.287 --> 01:12:41.887
Because it means I'm gonna be performing
for some faceless audience...

01:12:41.889 --> 01:12:44.123
instead of trying to have a
conversation with a person.

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:47.659
If you think that's faux... You know what?
You think whatever you want.

01:12:47.661 --> 01:12:51.196
I got a real, serious fear
of being a certain way.

01:12:51.198 --> 01:12:55.100
And a set, I think, of real convictions
about why I'm continuing to do this.

01:12:55.102 --> 01:12:58.203
Why it's worthwhile. Why it's not just
an exercise in getting my dick sucked.

01:12:58.205 --> 01:12:59.904
Okay.

01:12:59.906 --> 01:13:01.382
This is such a clever
tactic on your part.

01:13:01.408 --> 01:13:02.240
Tactic? What tactic?

01:13:02.242 --> 01:13:04.742
That's right. Get me a little pissed
off, get me a little less guarded...

01:13:04.744 --> 01:13:07.212
I'm gonna reveal more.
Yes, it's true.

01:13:07.214 --> 01:13:09.514
- I treasure my regular guyness.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:09.516 --> 01:13:12.083
I've come to think that maybe it's
my biggest asset as a writer.

01:13:12.085 --> 01:13:14.485
That I'm basically
just like everybody else.

01:13:17.388 --> 01:13:19.875
You know what? I'm not doing any
kind of faux thing with you.

01:13:19.901 --> 01:13:21.158
And I'm not gonna say it again.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.162
Okay. But that faux thing? What you just
said is an example of the faux thing.

01:13:25.164 --> 01:13:27.663
You're not willing to risk
giving the full you.

01:13:29.666 --> 01:13:33.336
I don't know if you're
a very nice man or not.

01:13:33.338 --> 01:13:36.171
It's very clear you don't
believe a word that I've said.

01:13:38.074 --> 01:13:41.242
All your protesting? You
know... I'm just a regular guy?

01:13:42.645 --> 01:13:44.712
You don't crack open
a thousand-page book...

01:13:44.714 --> 01:13:46.980
because you heard the author
is a regular guy.

01:13:46.982 --> 01:13:51.517
You do it because he's brilliant,
because you want him to be brilliant.

01:13:51.519 --> 01:13:53.519
So, who the fuck
are you kidding?

01:13:56.924 --> 01:14:00.059
I don't have the brain cells left to
play any kind of faux games with you.

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:01.461
Mm-hmm. It's fine. Yeah.

01:14:01.463 --> 01:14:03.396
Yeah, it's fine.

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:03.864
What are you thinking?

01:15:05.733 --> 01:15:08.936
Tour's over. Yeah.
That just hit you.

01:15:08.938 --> 01:15:12.307
Yeah. I'm gonna have to
kinda feel all of this now,

01:15:12.309 --> 01:15:14.442
instead of just
sleepwalk through it.

01:15:14.444 --> 01:15:17.278
What do you mean sleepwalking?

01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:21.850
I've sort of unplugged myself
the past three weeks.

01:15:21.852 --> 01:15:24.653
Meeting a whole lot of new
people and having to do stuff,

01:15:24.655 --> 01:15:28.023
you're in this constant
low-level state of anxiety.

01:15:28.025 --> 01:15:31.026
This deep existential fear you feel
all the way down in your butt hole.

01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:33.995
What are you afraid of?
I mean...

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:36.598
What's the worst
that could possibly happen?

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.068
The worst? That I really get to like it.
That's the worst.

01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:41.769
The attention? Yeah.

01:15:45.174 --> 01:15:46.807
What would be so wrong
with that?

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:50.578
Become one
of these hideous, like...

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:53.547
"Yet another publication party.
Hey, there's Dave.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.517
Stickin' his head
in the back of the photo."

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.357
- Rather be dead.
- Why?

01:16:02.359 --> 01:16:06.461
I don't wanna be seen that way.
Why, would you?

01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:12.467
Well, if you're deriving your satisfaction
from talking about your work...

01:16:12.469 --> 01:16:15.803
instead of actually writing,
then yeah.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:17.971
I mean, I guess you'd get
a lot less done.

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:20.841
Exactly. There's nothing more grotesque
than somebody going around saying,

01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:23.543
"I'm a writer. I'm a writer.
I'm a writer."

01:16:24.812 --> 01:16:26.813
I don't mind appearing
in <i> Rolling Stone.</i>

01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:28.848
I don't want to appear
in <i> Rolling Stone...</i>

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:31.985
as somebody who wants to be
in <i> Rolling Stone.</i>

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:35.521
If you see me on a game show in the
next couple of years, I swear to God...

01:16:38.058 --> 01:16:40.659
To have written a book
about how seductive image is,

01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:44.230
how easy it is to get seduced
off of any meaningful path...

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:46.398
because of the way
our culture is now...

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.067
What if I become a parody
of that very thing?

01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:53.471
You know, tomorrow,
you drive away.

01:16:53.473 --> 01:16:56.942
And you get on a plane,
and this whole thing is over.

01:16:56.944 --> 01:17:00.980
I go back to knowing, like,
20 people.

01:17:00.982 --> 01:17:04.516
I'm gonna have to decompress from all this
attention, because it's like gettin'...

01:17:04.518 --> 01:17:07.586
it's like gettin' heroin
injected into your cortex.

01:17:07.588 --> 01:17:10.755
And where I'm gonna need
real balls, is to...

01:17:11.623 --> 01:17:14.725
sit and go through that.

01:17:15.827 --> 01:17:18.496
And try to remind myself
of what the reality is...

01:17:18.498 --> 01:17:23.634
that I'm 34 years old and I'm alone
in a room with a piece of paper.

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.558
Hey. Here ya go.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.162
I'll never leave you again.
I swear.

01:17:52.599 --> 01:17:54.967
All right. Shit check.

01:17:56.903 --> 01:17:58.336
Look what you did.

01:17:58.338 --> 01:18:00.138
Look what you did.

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:04.142
A little excremental work. Looks like
we won't need this anymore, huh?

01:18:04.144 --> 01:18:06.912
It's all right. It happens
to the best of us. Huh, boy?

01:18:06.914 --> 01:18:08.480
Never fails.

01:18:08.482 --> 01:18:12.218
They wait to do their thing until
after the dog sitter leaves.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.886
Make sure your <i> Rolling Stone</i>
readers hear about that.

01:18:27.033 --> 01:18:30.803
Hey, so I'm-I'm leaving
tomorrow and, uh...

01:18:32.772 --> 01:18:36.842
I gotta ask you
about this rumor.

01:18:36.844 --> 01:18:38.677
Is this the heroin thing? Yeah.

01:18:38.679 --> 01:18:40.779
This is the heroin thing again?
Yeah.

01:18:40.781 --> 01:18:44.016
It isn't true. What is so
hard for you to believe?

01:18:44.018 --> 01:18:46.752
The reason it is so hard to believe
is because there is so much...

01:18:46.754 --> 01:18:48.755
about drugs and
addiction in the book.

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:50.223
That doesn't mean that
it's autobiographical.

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:54.027
The book stuff is meant to
be a metaphor. What is...

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:56.596
You don't believe a fuckin' word
that I've said, do you?

01:18:56.598 --> 01:18:58.464
I didn't say that.

01:18:58.466 --> 01:19:01.401
I was not...
I never was a heroin addict.

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:06.039
Okay. The rumor I heard was that in the
late '80s, when you were at Harvard,

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:08.574
you got involved with drugs, and
you had some kind of breakdown.

01:19:08.576 --> 01:19:10.943
I don't know if...

01:19:10.945 --> 01:19:14.013
I don't know if I had a breakdown.
I got very, very depressed.

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:17.383
I told you that. It had
nothing to do with drugs.

01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:20.920
I have spent most of my life in libraries.
I never lived that dangerous kind of life.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.721
And I would never stick
a needle into my arm...

01:19:22.723 --> 01:19:24.555
Okay, so how do you think
that rumor got started?

01:19:24.581 --> 01:19:25.324
I have no ide...

01:19:25.326 --> 01:19:27.326
- I have no idea.
- All right. All right. Calm down.

01:19:27.328 --> 01:19:32.131
And I'm telling you, if you were to
structure this as some sort of like,

01:19:32.133 --> 01:19:35.634
"and then he spiraled into
terrible addiction" sort of thing,

01:19:35.636 --> 01:19:37.837
it would be inaccurate.

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:41.574
It was much more that I got
more and more unhappy.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:44.578
The more unhappy I got,
the more I would drink.

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:49.717
There was no joy in that drinking.
I used it for anesthesia.

01:19:49.719 --> 01:19:52.286
Okay? Okay. What kind
of drinker were you?

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:55.390
Were you a kind of falling-down drinker?
Were you a "waking up in the curb" drinker?

01:19:55.392 --> 01:19:57.759
No, I was not. Okay? All right.

01:19:57.761 --> 01:20:00.796
A part of my reticence
about this whole thing...

01:20:00.798 --> 01:20:04.166
is that it won't make
very good copy for you.

01:20:04.168 --> 01:20:06.235
Because, no, I was not
like that at all.

01:20:06.237 --> 01:20:08.837
You did agree to this interview.
I know that I did.

01:20:08.839 --> 01:20:10.538
All right. I'm not gonna
push much further. Sorry.

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:14.276
I am also aware that some
addictions are sexier than others.

01:20:14.278 --> 01:20:18.047
My primary addiction my entire
life has been to television.

01:20:18.049 --> 01:20:20.616
I told you that.
Now television addiction...

01:20:20.618 --> 01:20:25.621
is of far less interest to your
readers than something like heroin...

01:20:25.623 --> 01:20:27.689
that confirms the mythos
of the writer.

01:20:27.691 --> 01:20:29.457
Yeah, a myth I do not believe.
Okay? Right. No.

01:20:29.459 --> 01:20:31.893
I know you don't believe that. I'm
also aware that one of the things...

01:20:31.895 --> 01:20:34.729
that's swirlin' around here is you want to
have the best fuckin' article you can have.

01:20:34.731 --> 01:20:37.365
See, you know what? Why don't you
write whatever the fuck you want.

01:20:37.367 --> 01:20:41.668
I am telling you that this was not
a <i> Lost Weekend</i> sort of thing.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:44.605
Nor was it some lurid,
romantic,

01:20:44.607 --> 01:20:46.540
"writer as alcoholic"
sort of thing.

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:49.143
What it was,
was a 28-year-old person...

01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:52.579
who had really exhausted
a couple other ways to live,

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:54.648
had really taken them
to their conclusion.

01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:58.885
Which for me was a pink room with a
drain in the center of the floor,

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:02.622
which is where they put me for an entire day
when they thought that I was gonna kill myself.

01:21:04.257 --> 01:21:08.694
Where I got nothin' on. I got someone
observing me through a slot in the wall.

01:21:10.029 --> 01:21:13.999
And when that happens to you,
you become tremendously,

01:21:14.001 --> 01:21:17.135
just unprecedentedly willing...

01:21:17.137 --> 01:21:20.339
to examine some other
alternatives for how to live.

01:22:20.273 --> 01:22:21.873
You awake?

01:22:23.075 --> 01:22:25.310
Yeah.

01:22:26.412 --> 01:22:28.245
I was just thinking, um...

01:22:31.216 --> 01:22:34.184
It wasn't a chemical imbalance,
and it wasn't drugs and alcohol.

01:22:34.186 --> 01:22:35.786
I think, um...

01:22:37.188 --> 01:22:41.391
It was much more that I had lived
an incredibly American life.

01:22:41.393 --> 01:22:47.799
This idea that if I could just achieve X and
Y and Z, that everything would be okay.

01:22:53.638 --> 01:22:58.976
There's a thing in the book about how when
somebody leaps from a burning skyscraper,

01:22:58.978 --> 01:23:01.212
it's not that they're not afraid
of falling anymore.

01:23:01.214 --> 01:23:05.149
It's that the alternative
is so awful.

01:23:05.151 --> 01:23:08.753
And so then you're invited to
consider what could be so awful...

01:23:08.755 --> 01:23:13.057
that leaping to your death would
seem like an escape from it.

01:23:14.726 --> 01:23:17.895
I don't know if you have any
experience with this kind of thing.

01:23:17.897 --> 01:23:20.397
But it's worse than any kind
of physical injury.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.403
It may be in the old days what was
known as a spiritual crisis...

01:23:30.242 --> 01:23:32.810
feeling as though every axiom in
your life turned out to be false...

01:23:32.812 --> 01:23:35.512
and there was actually nothing.

01:23:36.781 --> 01:23:39.582
And that you were nothing.

01:23:39.584 --> 01:23:43.920
And that it's all a delusion and you're
so much better than everybody...

01:23:43.922 --> 01:23:46.222
'cause you can see
how this is just a delusion,

01:23:46.224 --> 01:23:49.559
and you're so much worse because
you can't fucking function.

01:23:53.663 --> 01:23:55.831
It's really horrible.

01:24:01.671 --> 01:24:04.372
I don't think
that we ever change.

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:11.045
I'm sure that I still have
those same parts of me.

01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:20.956
Guess I'm trying really hard to
find a way not to let them drive.

01:24:24.861 --> 01:24:26.528
You know?

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:39.307
Hey, um, okay. Good night.

01:25:16.114 --> 01:25:18.616
Hi.

01:25:18.618 --> 01:25:20.618
Okay. Hi.

01:25:26.625 --> 01:25:29.961
Hey. Good morning.
Good morning.

01:25:45.844 --> 01:25:47.477
Mornin', man.

01:25:56.855 --> 01:25:59.657
Come on, boys.
Let's go. Good boys.

01:26:01.126 --> 01:26:03.166
Come on. What are you doing?

01:26:10.902 --> 01:26:12.536
Jeeves!

01:26:13.504 --> 01:26:15.137
Jeeves, come on, boy.

01:26:23.881 --> 01:26:27.460
You get instantaneous production
from the Jeeve-meister.

01:26:27.486 --> 01:26:29.218
Drone's a much tougher nut.

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.789
- It is so beautiful out here.
- Yeah.

01:26:32.791 --> 01:26:35.491
You should see it in the spring
when the wind blows.

01:26:35.493 --> 01:26:38.828
You can see ripples.
It's like water.

01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:42.032
- It's like the ocean, but real green.
- Mmm.

01:26:42.034 --> 01:26:43.767
It really is.

01:26:45.737 --> 01:26:48.371
It's kind of calm. Real pretty.

01:26:50.374 --> 01:26:53.309
You hungry? Uh, yeah. Kind of.

01:26:53.311 --> 01:26:57.313
But, um... God, I don't
think I want to go back.

01:26:58.148 --> 01:27:00.430
Yeah, I know how you feel.

01:27:04.186 --> 01:27:06.955
Should probably get going though.
Okay.

01:27:06.957 --> 01:27:10.188
Hey, let me take you
someplace nice this time.

01:27:10.214 --> 01:27:11.450
It'll be on Jann.

01:27:14.564 --> 01:27:16.397
Thanks for holding the bag, man.
Of course.

01:27:16.399 --> 01:27:18.760
I gotta eat something. I'm,
like, suddenly starving. Mmm.

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:26.473
You don't like pickles.
Oh, come on.

01:27:26.475 --> 01:27:28.208
What? What, the whole
world needs to know...

01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:30.277
what my mother's known for
years... I'm a picky eater?

01:27:30.279 --> 01:27:32.012
Okay, I'm putting it away.
Thank you.

01:27:32.014 --> 01:27:33.513
All right.

01:27:33.515 --> 01:27:35.014
Can I give 'em a fry?

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:36.316
No. Come on.

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:38.117
All right, go for it.
Hey, Jeeve-meister.

01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:39.718
Hey!

01:27:40.686 --> 01:27:41.953
Watch this. What?

01:27:41.955 --> 01:27:44.956
Jeeves. Jeeves. Sit.

01:27:44.958 --> 01:27:48.160
Jeeves, sit. Sit.

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:49.761
Sit. Perfect.

01:27:49.763 --> 01:27:53.532
Sit. God. Drone gets super
obedient when food is around.

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:55.800
Jeeves is still
kind of a wild man.

01:27:55.802 --> 01:27:58.769
Do not leave food out around him.
He will go for it.

01:27:59.538 --> 01:28:01.539
Good boy.

01:28:01.541 --> 01:28:03.073
You're such a good...

01:28:03.075 --> 01:28:05.676
You're not gonna make me look like
I'm one of those insane old women...

01:28:05.678 --> 01:28:07.778
who talks to their dogs, are you?
Um, no.

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:09.179
Don't worry about it.

01:28:09.181 --> 01:28:11.549
I am worried about it. My
dogs are gonna be offended.

01:28:11.551 --> 01:28:14.218
The dogs are not gonna
read this article.

01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.420
I gotta tell you. Hmm?

01:28:16.422 --> 01:28:19.223
They've never taken to a man
the way they've taken to you.

01:28:19.225 --> 01:28:20.624
Really? Nah.

01:28:20.626 --> 01:28:22.392
Except me, of course.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:22.394 --> 01:28:24.795
Oh. Can you hold this?

01:28:24.797 --> 01:28:26.730
Yeah, of course.

01:28:32.903 --> 01:28:34.470
Hello?

01:28:35.238 --> 01:28:37.573
Hey.

01:28:38.441 --> 01:28:40.442
Yes, I would like to, um...

01:28:40.444 --> 01:28:42.445
I can't right now.
I got this guy here.

01:28:42.447 --> 01:28:44.180
<i>What guy?</i>

01:28:47.016 --> 01:28:49.151
<i>Rolling Stone</i> guy, yeah.

01:28:50.052 --> 01:28:52.412
You know, can I just
meet you there?

01:28:53.321 --> 01:28:56.424
Okay. Great. Yeah, perfect.

01:28:56.426 --> 01:28:58.426
I'll see you then. Bye.

01:29:02.230 --> 01:29:03.830
All right. Well, I should...

01:29:03.832 --> 01:29:06.600
I should probably get out of here,
let you get on with your life.

01:29:06.602 --> 01:29:11.303
That's, no... It's... There's just
this dance that I like to go to.

01:29:12.139 --> 01:29:13.939
Sorry. You dance?

01:29:13.941 --> 01:29:15.607
Yeah.

01:29:15.609 --> 01:29:18.010
It's something I've discovered over
the past couple years I really like.

01:29:18.012 --> 01:29:19.478
Although I'm not that good
at it yet.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:21.413
Wait, sorry.
What kind of dancing?

01:29:22.348 --> 01:29:24.950
I tend to do, like,
the jerk, the swim.

01:29:24.952 --> 01:29:27.652
You know, like,
cheesy '70s disco.

01:29:27.654 --> 01:29:30.722
Really? Yeah. It's one of the
things about living in Bloomington.

01:29:30.724 --> 01:29:33.257
It's like a time warp. You're
completely hip if you do that.

01:29:33.259 --> 01:29:36.427
Yeah, right. So, where do you go?
To a club?

01:29:37.395 --> 01:29:39.435
I go to this Baptist church.

01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:41.564
Why... Why do you go there?

01:29:42.098 --> 01:29:43.798
Baptists can dance.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.967
Wow. Dancing.

01:29:46.969 --> 01:29:48.736
I will not vogue.

01:29:48.738 --> 01:29:52.005
<i>That is where I put my foot
down. I do not vogue.</i>

01:29:52.007 --> 01:29:55.075
<i>Yeah. It's really cool though.
Like a lot of people show up.</i>

01:29:55.077 --> 01:29:57.343
<i>And they got their
dancin' shoes on.</i>

01:29:57.345 --> 01:30:01.614
<i>It's good. It's nice. Everyone for the
most part just leaves each other alone.</i>

01:30:06.319 --> 01:30:08.987
<i>I thought it might be nice
before you go, if...</i>

01:30:08.989 --> 01:30:13.125
uh, maybe we could exchange
address data or something?

01:30:13.127 --> 01:30:14.759
Yeah. Absolutely.

01:30:14.761 --> 01:30:18.096
<i>Yeah. I'll get my stuff together.
Great.</i>

01:30:18.098 --> 01:30:20.598
<i>I'll start carving an ice
sculpture out of my car.</i>

01:30:20.624 --> 01:30:22.191
<i>It's like Antarctica out there.</i>

01:30:44.892 --> 01:30:49.096
Uh, dog stuff. Throw toys. Chew toys.
Crap stains on carpet.

01:30:49.098 --> 01:30:54.001
Uh, fireplace. American flag.
Shark doll on bookcase.

01:30:54.003 --> 01:30:56.236
Alanis poster. Uh, soda cans.

01:30:56.238 --> 01:30:58.638
Lots of them. There's Pepsi.
There's Mountain Dew.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.509
Um, looks like a frat.
A kind of bookish frat.

01:31:02.511 --> 01:31:05.211
Uh, there's a Botticelli
calendar... <i>Birth of Venus.</i>

01:31:05.213 --> 01:31:09.315
Uh, wooden chess set.
Postcard of Updike.

01:31:09.317 --> 01:31:14.286
Um, brain comparison...
male, female, dog. Cartoon.

01:31:15.688 --> 01:31:18.123
In the bedroom, there is a
Barney towel used as a curtain.

01:31:18.125 --> 01:31:20.892
There is a tennis ball. There's
a dental floss on top of books.

01:31:20.894 --> 01:31:24.096
There's a photo collage of his family,
the kind kids put in their dorm rooms.

01:31:24.098 --> 01:31:28.033
His sister is kind of pretty. She
looks like a female version of him.

01:31:28.035 --> 01:31:30.879
There is, uh, stuff everywhere.
Clothes everywhere.

01:31:30.905 --> 01:31:32.137
Sneakers on the floor.

01:31:32.139 --> 01:31:33.938
Clothes draped over stuff.

01:31:35.775 --> 01:31:37.442
Uh...

01:31:37.444 --> 01:31:40.711
Blue toilet-seat cover,
looks like a rug.

01:31:40.713 --> 01:31:44.115
Postcards.
Clintons, um, baboons.

01:31:44.117 --> 01:31:46.817
A Saint Ignatius quote.

01:31:46.819 --> 01:31:49.821
"Lord, teach me to be generous. Teach
me to serve you as you deserve."

01:31:49.823 --> 01:31:53.659
To give and not to count the cost.
To toil and not to seek for rest.

01:31:53.661 --> 01:31:56.628
To labor and not to ask
for reward...

01:31:56.630 --> 01:31:59.998
"save that of knowing
that I do your will."

01:33:27.395 --> 01:33:29.095
Hey.

01:33:29.097 --> 01:33:31.998
Tell you what. Riding around
in that rental of yours.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.134
That feeling of gliding? This thing
doesn't even have shock absorbers.

01:33:35.136 --> 01:33:36.669
What... What is it?

01:33:36.671 --> 01:33:38.270
It's just an old Civic.

01:33:38.272 --> 01:33:41.374
I know it doesn't look like much.
But, man, this thing starts.

01:33:41.376 --> 01:33:44.043
It's actually a problem.
Why is that a problem?

01:33:44.045 --> 01:33:46.925
I gotta get a new one, but I
can't junk this. Why not?

01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:49.213
It's my friend.

01:33:49.215 --> 01:33:50.981
Ah.

01:33:53.585 --> 01:33:55.152
Hey, David. I, uh...

01:33:56.354 --> 01:33:58.188
Wow. Just happened
to have one on you, huh?

01:33:58.190 --> 01:34:02.392
Yeah. I mean, I... I did debate
whether or not I should do this.

01:34:02.394 --> 01:34:04.026
Why? I don't know.

01:34:04.028 --> 01:34:07.797
Don't you think it's some kind of
kid-brother sort of thing to do?

01:34:07.799 --> 01:34:11.033
No. Thank you. I look
forward to reading this.

01:34:11.035 --> 01:34:15.304
Oh, you're welcome. I put my
address and e-mail on the flyleaf.

01:34:15.306 --> 01:34:18.341
Oh. Okay. Cool.

01:34:18.343 --> 01:34:22.611
I'll, uh... Yeah, I'll read it after I finish
the Heinlein, and I'll send you a note.

01:34:22.613 --> 01:34:25.615
That's great. Thanks.

01:34:25.617 --> 01:34:28.483
Be interesting to be inside
your head for a while.

01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:33.288
I like your cover.
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:36.625
I actually had them use the same
art for the British edition.

01:34:36.627 --> 01:34:39.427
Come on. You got
approval, and I d...

01:34:44.066 --> 01:34:45.466
It's nice. It's very nice.

01:34:45.468 --> 01:34:49.070
Don't worry about it. It was not
such a... not such a big success.

01:35:07.992 --> 01:35:10.860
Hey, isn't it at all reassuring to
have a lot of people read you...

01:35:10.862 --> 01:35:13.903
and, you know, say that you're
a really strong writer?

01:35:15.932 --> 01:35:18.634
It'll be interesting to
talk to you in a few years.

01:35:18.636 --> 01:35:20.469
Why do you say that?

01:35:21.637 --> 01:35:24.573
My experience is that
that is not so.

01:35:26.909 --> 01:35:29.043
The more people think
you're really great,

01:35:29.045 --> 01:35:31.813
actually the bigger the fear
of being a fraud is, you know?

01:35:31.815 --> 01:35:34.949
The worst thing about getting a
lot of attention paid to you...

01:35:34.951 --> 01:35:36.918
is that you're afraid
of bad attention.

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.453
And if bad attention hurts you,

01:35:39.455 --> 01:35:43.290
the caliber of the weapon
pointing at you has gone way up.

01:35:43.292 --> 01:35:46.660
Like from a .22 to a .45. Mmm.

01:35:46.662 --> 01:35:50.430
Look, there are parts of me that want a lot
of attention and think I'm really great...

01:35:50.432 --> 01:35:52.965
and want other people
to see it.

01:35:55.002 --> 01:35:58.704
I think that's one of the ways you
and I are sort of alike, you know?

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:03.775
All right. Hey, uh... All right.

01:36:09.682 --> 01:36:11.784
Fuck. David.

01:36:15.988 --> 01:36:18.270
I'm not so sure
you want to be me.

01:36:19.224 --> 01:36:20.691
I don't.

01:36:21.659 --> 01:36:24.094
Give my best to Jann.

01:38:24.533 --> 01:38:26.734
<i>"When I think of this trip,".</i>

01:38:26.736 --> 01:38:30.871
<i>I see David and me
in the front seat of his car.</i>

01:38:30.873 --> 01:38:33.673
<i>We are both so young.</i>

01:38:33.675 --> 01:38:35.909
<i>He wants something better
than he has.</i>

01:38:35.911 --> 01:38:39.479
<i>I want precisely
what he has already.</i>

01:38:39.481 --> 01:38:43.116
Neither of us knows where
our lives are going to go.

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.819
It smells like chewing tobacco,

01:38:46.821 --> 01:38:50.390
soda and smoke.

01:38:50.392 --> 01:38:54.461
And the conversation is
the best one I ever had.

01:38:59.634 --> 01:39:04.737
<i>David thought books existed
to stop you from feeling lonely.</i>

01:39:04.739 --> 01:39:08.208
<i>If I could, I'd say to David that
living those days with him...</i>

01:39:08.210 --> 01:39:10.076
<i>reminded me
of what life is like,</i>

01:39:10.078 --> 01:39:13.980
instead of being
a relief from it.

01:39:15.415 --> 01:39:19.018
"And I'd tell him it made
me feel much less alone."

01:40:51.191 --> 01:40:52.859
I need to use your bathroom
for a second.

01:40:52.861 --> 01:40:55.461
I believe it's unoccupied.

01:41:09.174 --> 01:41:11.543
It's me talkin'
into the tape recorder.

01:41:14.947 --> 01:41:18.750
And Drone's sittin' behind me
just chillin' out.

01:41:18.752 --> 01:41:22.587
I'm smoking. Having just said I
wouldn't smoke, I'm smoking.

01:41:25.625 --> 01:41:28.059
Just me and your tape recorder.
