{\an3}Because I'm just gonna
enjoy this and--

07:49.427 --> 07:52.221
{\an1}- What?
No, you have to get married.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.890
- What?
- I clearly stated

07:53.973 --> 07:56.601
{\an1}that you have to close the deal.
That means marriage.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.727
I mean, come on, do I have to
spell everything out for you?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.396
- No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
- So now, Jeff,

08:00.479 --> 08:02.273
I'm going to say good-bye.
- Just listen, don't cut me off

08:02.356 --> 08:03.649
this time, just let me--don't
cut me off, do not cut me off.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.943
{\an1}- Which means
our conversation is over.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.570
{\an3}- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Oh!

08:07.653 --> 08:10.323
{\an3}Seriously,
that guy is the worst.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.411
{\an8}- Come on, right this way.
Just a little bit further.

08:15.494 --> 08:16.621
{\an9}- [chuckles]
Hey, you know why I think

08:16.704 --> 08:19.415
{\an3}we're working so well
this time around?

08:19.498 --> 08:21.626
- Why is that?
- Because we're taking it slow.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.962
{\an3}We're not trying to put labels
on anything.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.714
{\an1}- No labels?
[chuckles]

08:26.797 --> 08:28.424
{\an1}Excuse me.

08:28.507 --> 08:29.508
Get--get out of here!
Get out of here!

08:29.592 --> 08:31.928
- Huh?
- You know what?

08:32.010 --> 08:33.721
{\an1}I just realized
we're on the wrong mountain.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.597
[chuckles]
- Wait, what?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.642
- The view here sucks, so what
do you say we turn around, huh?

08:37.725 --> 08:40.227
{\an3}- We've been hiking for, like,
three hours.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.687
{\an3}Let's at least
just take a look.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.188
{\an1}- No, no, no, no.
No need to look around, okay?

08:43.272 --> 08:44.232
{\an3}- Jeff, stop.
Let me see what's--

08:44.315 --> 08:45.691
{\an1}- Just come on, come on,
come on, come on.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.944
- [gasps]
all: [singing in Spanish]

08:48.027 --> 08:50.321
- Oh, no.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.990
- [chuckles]
That's crazy.

08:53.074 --> 08:56.369
{\an1}Somebody must be proposing to
another person named Linda here.

08:56.452 --> 08:59.205
{\an1}Oh, damn.
I forgot about that part.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.416
{\an3}- Oh, Jeff.
You always want something more,

09:02.500 --> 09:05.461
{\an3}yet you can't just be happy
in the moment.

09:05.544 --> 09:08.297
{\an3}I guess we're just
on very different pages.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.800
{\an1}- No, no, no, no, no.
We're on the same page, I swear.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.177
{\an1}[chuckles]
Shut the [bleep] up!

09:13.261 --> 09:16.472
{\an1}[chuckles] I want to take
things slow too, all right?

09:16.555 --> 09:17.807
{\an1}We don't have
to get married today.

09:17.890 --> 09:21.644
{\an1}Just sometime in the next, uh,
four days.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.982
{\an7}We're [bleep], we're [bleep].
She dumped me.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.317
{\an1}We're all gonna die,
we're all gonna [bleep] die.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.612
- You know, Zarga wouldn't
marry me either.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.448
She said I was too creepy.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.743
Well, I showed her.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.162
<i>I bought some</i>
<i>black market parts</i>

09:40.246 --> 09:44.625

<i>the love out of other couples.</i>

09:44.709 --> 09:48.087
<i>Then I pumped their love</i>
<i>into her,</i>

09:48.170 --> 09:50.881
<i>so she had no choice</i>
<i>but to love me.</i>

09:50.965 --> 09:54.635
<i>Soon, I had my sweetheart</i>
<i>back in my loving arms.</i>

09:59.223 --> 10:01.851
My sweet little bird.

10:01.934 --> 10:05.313

the creepiest thing

10:05.396 --> 10:07.189
I've ever heard in my life.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.359
But I guess I don't really
have any other options, do I?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.861
- I can't think of any.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.887

- Hey, Sammy, quick question.

10:37.970 --> 10:43.684
Relationships that are, uh,
not necessarily the best,

10:43.768 --> 10:46.896
those still have love in them
that can be sucked out, right?

10:46.979 --> 10:49.106
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
You--you probably need

10:49.190 --> 10:50.733
a lot more couples,
but that should work.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.234

I mean,

10:52.318 --> 10:54.111
I'd actually be doing
something good.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.280
- Hey, Jeff, I gotta go, I don't
want to burn my chicken breasts.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.199
I spent all day marinating them,
and I really don't want

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Okay, you--you know what?

12:10.729 --> 12:12.648

a mistake.

is teach you how to dress.

Great, now I'll be
a bachelor for life.

She's totally out of control.

with the worst kind

What did you expect?

12:34.962 --> 12:37.006

Sammy told me it was okay.

I don't use machines

I'm not some weird loser.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.720

You're getting married?

That's awesome.

kinda wasting your time

so far out of your league.

I'm getting mad

They were out.

Oh, okay.

I pay you in scrap paper?

14:57.313 --> 14:58.606

14:58.689 --> 15:00.107
I'll make sure to
find some peonies.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.235
{\an1}- Yeah, you do that because
my wife is extremely volatile,

isn't perfect,

You--you don't understand, okay?

You gotta break out

with any horns in it
