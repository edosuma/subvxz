01:52.813 --> 01:56.450
Don't fear, when the
48-hour cycle ends,

01:57.985 --> 01:59.620
we will be back to normal.

02:32.153 --> 02:32.986
Izzy!

02:34.155 --> 02:37.055
What have I told you
about being out here?

02:37.057 --> 02:39.327
Come on, inside, now!

02:53.874 --> 02:54.675
Mom?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.677
I think it's time.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.714
I think it's time we
told her the truth.

03:04.118 --> 03:05.386
For her safety.

03:17.131 --> 03:17.965
The curse.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.469
He will rise soon.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.084
Izzy, love.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.422
We have something we should
have told you a long time ago.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.957
We think that now is
the time to tell you

03:45.959 --> 03:48.394
the truth about our family.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.929
About the land that we live on.

03:50.931 --> 03:55.936
And about the curse that our
family has had for generations.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.274
What is it, Mom?

04:02.510 --> 04:07.379
For generations, our family
goes back to one fatal evening

04:07.381 --> 04:11.051
in the spring of
1910 when a man,

04:12.386 --> 04:15.556
your great-great-great-grandfather,
Antony Web,

04:17.658 --> 04:19.993
was brutally murdered by locals.

04:21.394 --> 04:24.196
You see, they thought he was
stealing, so they strung him up

04:24.198 --> 04:27.733
on a cross in the cornfields
and they left him for dead.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.769
He starved.

04:30.204 --> 04:33.674
And the crows pecked out
his eyes, but there was also

04:35.376 --> 04:37.142
what the legend doesn't tell.

04:37.144 --> 04:41.079
His soon-to-be-wife,
Mary-Lou Jameson,

04:41.081 --> 04:44.182
she was also murdered
by the locals.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.587
They thought she was
stealing alongside him.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.524
So she was taken to a
stable on this land,

04:51.725 --> 04:53.259
and she was set on fire.

04:54.762 --> 04:58.564
They both died on this land,
leaving nothing but one child

04:58.566 --> 05:01.433
in the protection of neighbors
who promised to raise

05:01.435 --> 05:03.935
the baby as if it was their own.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.073
These people from our family.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.008
They were murdered?

05:09.777 --> 05:12.280
The curse goes that
Antony is seen on this land.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.382
For years there have been
old wives tales about him,

05:16.384 --> 05:19.953
cursing him to be a scarecrow.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.157
Roaming these lands
every 20 years.

05:25.693 --> 05:29.495
And for 48 hours, he
can take the lives

05:29.497 --> 05:30.864
of those who walk his land.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.335
He kills innocent people?

05:35.736 --> 05:38.071
They say his soul is
trapped in the same time.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.507
For years, your nana and I
have protected these lands

05:41.509 --> 05:43.143
ensuring that no one gets hurt.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.415
As you come into yourself,

05:48.616 --> 05:51.118
we must make you
a protector, too.

05:53.186 --> 05:57.556
We've kept this a secret
for many years, but tonight,

05:57.558 --> 06:00.994
the Scarecrow will
rise to seek his bride.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.077
I'm scared.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.981
Look, we're safe inside.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.719
We stick together
and we're safe.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.120
As long as no one leaves the
house, stepping on his land,

06:29.122 --> 06:30.924
then we are safe.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.461
We're gatekeepers now, Izzy.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.496
Do you want me to
stay with you tonight?

06:37.498 --> 06:38.332
Yeah.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.267
Yeah.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.570
Look, our family's lived on
this farm for generations

06:44.572 --> 06:46.440
protecting the family secret.

06:48.108 --> 06:52.179
Why does Antony, why
does this Scarecrow,

06:53.146 --> 06:55.182
why does he want to hurt people?

06:58.018 --> 07:02.523
Anyone on his land is
in danger, he's not evil,

07:03.691 --> 07:08.061
he's just tormented by
the curse of the fields.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.731
Would he hurt us?

07:15.436 --> 07:19.170
Look, as long as we stay
inside and we don't disturb him,

07:19.172 --> 07:21.039
then we're safe, okay?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.475
And then in the
morning, we'll go out,

07:23.477 --> 07:26.445
and we protect the land and
make sure no one trespasses.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.814
Are we related to Antony?

07:28.816 --> 07:31.550
Is this why we
protect his secret?

07:31.552 --> 07:35.288
We're related to his
wife-to-be, Mary-Lou.

07:36.690 --> 07:37.991
Was she innocent?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.462
The legend goes that
they were wrongly-accused,

07:43.464 --> 07:45.030
but no one knows.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.966
Okay, look, this is a lot
for you to take in, now just

07:47.968 --> 07:50.704
go to sleep and forget about
it till the morning, okay?

08:13.060 --> 08:13.894
Mom?

09:24.031 --> 09:24.865
Izzy.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.101
Izzy!

09:55.996 --> 09:56.997
Scarecrow?

09:59.332 --> 10:00.167
Antony.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.925
Mom!

10:26.927 --> 10:27.761
Mom!

10:41.341 --> 10:45.212
She was here, she was
right here, he's got her!

10:48.115 --> 10:50.415
Where the hell did
you get that from?

10:50.417 --> 10:53.284
In case anything
like this happened!

10:53.286 --> 10:54.087
Come on!

11:02.462 --> 11:03.463
It's open.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.731
You wait outside.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.298
No, Mom, you can't
go in there alone.

11:07.300 --> 11:11.670
You wait here,
this ends tonight.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.940
- Mom, please, no.
- Sabina, please.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.944
Please, just, just stay.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.578
I'm fine!

11:52.746 --> 11:53.546
I'm fine!

11:55.615 --> 11:56.416
I'm fine.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.088
Izzy.

12:47.735 --> 12:48.936
This ends here.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.145
Mom?

13:02.816 --> 13:03.650
Mom!

13:10.323 --> 13:11.158
Mom!

13:42.289 --> 13:43.123
Izzy.

13:44.691 --> 13:45.525
Shh!

13:48.161 --> 13:49.496
Izzy.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.864
Izzy, where are you?

13:52.866 --> 13:54.132
Mom!

13:54.134 --> 13:57.468
I can hear
you, Izzy, it's me.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.271
Izzy.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.482
I mean, I just think if
she was being stalked for all

15:17.484 --> 15:20.886
this time, then the police
would have found some evidence.

15:20.888 --> 15:24.055
I mean, this case
went on for years.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.224
I have to go
against you and say

15:26.226 --> 15:28.193
I honestly think
there was a stalker.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.928
So you don't think
it was all in her head?

15:29.930 --> 15:33.831
No, I mean, the picture
the police painted, sure.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.134
But when you look at
how her body was found.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.668
How did she have hog ties on?

15:37.670 --> 15:38.870
Well you don't think
she could've just

15:38.872 --> 15:40.105
put them on herself?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.840
No, I think someone
killed her, I just can't

15:42.842 --> 15:46.611
imagine a person being able
to do that to themselves.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.248
Okay, guys, I'm afraid
we are out of time,

15:50.250 --> 15:53.584
but please do let us know
your thoughts on the fan page.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.620
Do you think Mona
killed herself,

15:55.622 --> 15:58.123
or do you think
she was murdered?

15:58.125 --> 16:02.928
This 1984 case still
remains unsolved.

16:02.930 --> 16:06.831
You're listening to May
Sealey on May the Dead Rest.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.767
This is our limited-series
event where we'll be discussing

16:09.769 --> 16:13.271
unresolved murders of the 1980s.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.741
Do let us know your
thoughts, until next time.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.613
Hello, uh, you wanted to see me?

16:22.649 --> 16:23.483
Yeah.

16:27.020 --> 16:30.257
How do you feel the
show went today?

16:31.691 --> 16:34.494
Yeah, good, I mean, it's
a really fun show to be on.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.096
Why?

16:38.098 --> 16:38.999
Well...

16:40.333 --> 16:41.899
It's not about what I like,

16:41.901 --> 16:45.638
it's more about what
the listeners like and,

16:47.340 --> 16:52.345
you lost half your
audience today and, uh,

16:53.746 --> 16:57.617
that makes your slot the least
listened to slot all week.

16:58.085 --> 16:58.885
Oh.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.488
I mean, I could get more
controversial with my opinions.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.089
I could jazz it up
a bit, I could...

17:05.092 --> 17:07.527
Look, let me cut to
the chase here, I mean,

17:08.494 --> 17:11.963
this just isn't working.

17:11.964 --> 17:15.167
And I'm sure you're
more than aware that,

17:16.868 --> 17:20.671
your show, it's just not
what you wanted it to be.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.707
Yeah, that's 'cause
of the stories!

17:22.709 --> 17:24.275
I mean, the stories
that I get given,

17:24.277 --> 17:28.779
they're absolutely crap,
there's only so much I can do!

17:28.781 --> 17:31.251
Let's not look at
layin' the blame here.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.987
We're putting you
on an earlier slot.

17:35.989 --> 17:38.223
God, please don't tell
me the early morning...

17:38.225 --> 17:40.560
It's the two to six AM slot.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.164
Really?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.932
Seriously?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.634
That's absolute suicide.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.602
I can't believe you're
doing this to me.

17:51.604 --> 17:56.041
So you'll do your last
afternoon drive time slot today,

17:56.043 --> 18:00.313
and then we'll go from the
early slots from then on.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.486
Absolutely gutted, I
don't know what to say.

18:08.021 --> 18:10.523
Okay, thanks for
the opportunity.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.633
You have a phone
call on line two.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.704
Okay, thanks.

19:04.010 --> 19:04.944
May speaking.

19:09.015 --> 19:09.849
What?

19:14.221 --> 19:15.054
Oh, my god.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.195
Really?

19:29.269 --> 19:32.437
Yeah, look at it.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.904
- What's that?
- I don't know!

19:33.906 --> 19:35.773
I think it's some sort of
sheep or a goat or something.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.076
Do you have goats there?

19:38.478 --> 19:40.545
So you're telling me...

19:40.547 --> 19:44.482
Yeah, that I've inherited
this, this property.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.684
- What the hell, May?
- I know!

19:46.686 --> 19:50.288
I mean, apparently I'm next
in line to inherit this plot

19:50.290 --> 19:51.824
of land and everything.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.525
Does your mum know?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.026
No

19:56.028 --> 19:58.129
I don't think I'm gonna tell
her either, to be honest.

19:58.131 --> 20:00.765
I don't think I really
care how she feels.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.468
She's never given you any
idea as to who your father was?

20:03.470 --> 20:05.970
No, never.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.405
So what are we waiting for?

20:07.407 --> 20:08.906
Let's bail!

20:08.908 --> 20:11.008
You don't think
it's a bit weird?

20:11.010 --> 20:14.745
I mean, a father that I've
never met all of a sudden

20:14.747 --> 20:18.716
just dies and then I
inherit this property.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.619
It's just a bit
too good to be true

20:21.621 --> 20:24.622
All I see is a gold mine

20:24.624 --> 20:27.158
Yeah, of course you do.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.993
Do you think I should
just sell it then?

20:28.995 --> 20:33.564
Babe, sell it, rent
it out, do whatever.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.932
Just get out this shitty job

20:34.934 --> 20:36.301
that doesn't respect
your talents.

20:36.303 --> 20:38.203
Oh god, yeah, I didn't
even think of that.

20:38.205 --> 20:41.741
The way I see it, it
solves all your worries.

20:43.176 --> 20:46.279
Oh, my god, do you think
I should quit my job?

20:47.680 --> 20:49.380
Do it now.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.682
Okay, oh, my god.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.150
- What, right now?
- Why not?

20:53.152 --> 20:54.687
Oh, my god, okay!

20:56.289 --> 20:57.257
Right, okay.

20:59.025 --> 20:59.826
Hang on.

21:03.095 --> 21:03.994
Hello?

21:03.996 --> 21:05.430
Connie?

21:05.432 --> 21:07.932
Hiya, yeah, it's May.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.068
Sorry.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.136
Yeah, just a quick one, really.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.105
I just wanted to say that
I won't be coming in today.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.376
I actually won't be coming
in for rest of the week.

21:18.378 --> 21:22.413
Actually, I'm not gonna be
coming in at all, okay, bye.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.418
Fuck!

21:27.420 --> 21:30.321
That's what I'm talkin' about.

21:30.323 --> 21:34.827
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- She's gonna go mental!

21:37.096 --> 21:37.930
Alright.

21:40.233 --> 21:43.734
The map's saying it's
about a four-hour journey.

21:43.736 --> 21:44.935
Oh, really?

21:44.937 --> 21:47.037
Well I've packed
loads of stuff in here

21:47.039 --> 21:49.342
like snacks and stuff,
so just help yourselves.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.344
Are you excited to own a farm?

21:53.346 --> 21:55.045
Um, yeah!

21:55.047 --> 21:57.982
I mean, it's just a bit weird,
it's just a bit out the blue.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.886
No one's ever mentioned this
side of the family, not ever?

22:01.888 --> 22:04.822
No, I don't know anything
about my biological parents.

22:04.824 --> 22:08.092
Are you gonna tell about
this to your adoptive parents?

22:08.094 --> 22:11.929
No, I mean, they weren't
exactly good parents to me.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.532
I'm pretty sure they just
adopted me to get more benefits.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.267
If I told them, they'd
want half the money.

22:16.269 --> 22:19.904
Aw, you have us, we're a
different type of family.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.272
Yeah.

22:21.274 --> 22:23.474
Do you think this
could be a good story

22:23.476 --> 22:24.642
for your radio show?

22:24.644 --> 22:27.678
May the Dead Rest.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.282
Farmland murders.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.650
Yeah, but we need to
find out what happened

22:32.652 --> 22:34.352
to these people, so come on!

22:34.354 --> 22:36.656
Well, I guess that's
what we're about to do!

22:44.130 --> 22:47.932
Uh, what is with that suitcase?

22:47.934 --> 22:49.934
It's just the essentials.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.470
What, like your
whole wardrobe?

22:52.472 --> 22:54.271
You can take the
man out the city,

22:54.273 --> 22:55.940
but you can't take
the city out the man.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.110
- Oh, my god, cheese on toast.
- Come here.

23:02.281 --> 23:05.316
So, what's with
bringin' your friends?

23:05.318 --> 23:08.653
Sorry, but
they're like my family!

23:08.655 --> 23:11.255
I know they're a bit weird
but they're all I've got.

23:11.257 --> 23:13.123
I wanna celebrate.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.159
- Very sentimental.
- I know, I know.

23:15.161 --> 23:19.830
But it'll be fun, come on!

23:19.832 --> 23:22.232
Okay, get in the car.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.604
Alright.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.706
Let's get this trip on the road!

23:28.708 --> 23:31.175
Wallcreak Manor, here we come.

24:11.117 --> 24:11.951
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:13.386 --> 24:16.053
- Mister Hammerson?
- Please call me Tony.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.288
Hi, May, nice to meet you.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.758
I hope you don't mind, I brought
some of my friends with me.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.727
It's your new home.

24:22.729 --> 24:25.732
- Do you wanna come inside?
- Yes, please, it's so cold

24:56.195 --> 24:59.329
So, what's the big catch?

24:59.331 --> 25:02.467
Now that I've signed,
it's your cue to tell me

25:02.469 --> 25:04.571
this big mystery
about this place.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.277
Your relatives, the ones
that owned the property before.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.815
They vanished without a trace.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.884
It was just over a year ago now.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.452
They were recently
classified as deceased,

25:21.454 --> 25:24.154
so now the property
is being moved onto

25:24.156 --> 25:26.425
the next in line,
which is yourself.

25:28.828 --> 25:32.164
Your father was the
son to Tracey Warren.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.502
She was your grandmother.

25:36.703 --> 25:40.439
Her, her daughter
and granddaughter,

25:42.008 --> 25:43.510
vanished from this property.

25:44.511 --> 25:46.043
What do you mean, vanished?

25:46.045 --> 25:48.813
It's just like they picked
up, packed up and took off.

25:48.815 --> 25:49.982
Never to be seen again.

25:52.519 --> 25:54.587
I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

25:55.988 --> 25:58.791
But I can imagine the
concern it brings to you.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.360
But what I can say is
whatever happened then,

26:03.362 --> 26:07.364
it's believed to be gone now,
so, so now it's up to you.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.536
The property is yours, to sell.

26:11.070 --> 26:11.904
It's yours now.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.746
There's some lovely local
produce up the road.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.580
Oh, lovely.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.050
Bit of a drive but...

26:25.985 --> 26:27.184
Signal's pretty bad around here,

26:27.186 --> 26:28.519
but I'm on the other
end of the line.

26:28.521 --> 26:30.755
Okay, well, thank you so much.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.489
It was really nice to meet you.

26:32.491 --> 26:33.893
- Thanks, May.
- Thank you.

27:23.342 --> 27:24.176
Whoa.

27:25.978 --> 27:29.749
So, they have no idea
what happened to them?

27:31.718 --> 27:32.551
No idea.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.855
He said it's like they
just picked up and vanished.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.224
Look, it's still on the
cards that they could literally

27:40.226 --> 27:42.526
have gone off for
a new life, right?

27:42.528 --> 27:43.362
Hm.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.296
Doesn't seem likely.

27:46.298 --> 27:50.236
So, May, what are you thinking
of doing with this house?

27:52.504 --> 27:53.773
I don't know.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.776
I think maybe I'll just sell it.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.077
I mean, the sort of money a
place like this could give me,

28:00.079 --> 28:02.546
I could actually
study journalism.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.849
Then I wouldn't have to work
for such twats that just wanna

28:04.851 --> 28:08.487
hear me talk about
torture porn stories.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.890
I mean, it's not like I
actually knew the people

28:12.892 --> 28:15.828
that lived here, I had no
relationship with them at all.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.363
I mean, there's nothing
actually keeping me here.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.866
Hell yeah, you're
absolutely right.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.804
Mark this as a payment for
your dad never being around.

28:25.638 --> 28:26.671
Anya.

28:26.673 --> 28:27.805
What?

28:27.807 --> 28:29.606
You're right.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.343
This is a good thing.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.684
Shit.

28:39.686 --> 28:41.688
They have real chickens.

28:47.860 --> 28:48.695
Oh.

28:50.329 --> 28:55.334
Hey, baby.

29:10.316 --> 29:11.150
Hello.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.243
Hey, Anya!

29:40.312 --> 29:41.313
Yeah?

29:43.315 --> 29:45.149
- What?
- Anya?

29:45.151 --> 29:46.452
Yeah, I'm coming.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.494
Is that blood?

29:56.495 --> 29:58.996
Oh, come on, Chris.

29:58.998 --> 29:59.832
What?

30:01.267 --> 30:03.669
Don't be saying shit like
that around May, she'll freak.

30:05.772 --> 30:07.306
I'm sure that's blood.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.007
Blood, paint.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.777
Hell, it could even
be chicken blood?

30:12.779 --> 30:13.612
Who knows?

30:15.982 --> 30:17.481
Oh, come on.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.585
I'm sure the police did
a good scout around here.

30:24.824 --> 30:27.224
You have to loosen
up a little bit.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.894
Just stop running your thoughts.

30:29.896 --> 30:30.997
Chill, dude, hm?

30:31.864 --> 30:33.931
Cool.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.412
Anya, I think this
looks like more blood.

30:47.479 --> 30:48.647
You're kidding me.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.272
Babe?

31:14.440 --> 31:16.208
What do you want me
to do with the boxes?

31:18.710 --> 31:22.448
Uh, just unpack
them in the kitchen.

32:47.333 --> 32:48.899
Why, hello, my busters.

32:48.901 --> 32:51.401
MythBuster himself here.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.770
Anyone looking to get into
the spooky spirit of the dead,

32:53.772 --> 32:56.040
this certainly will
not disappoint.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.274
Sit back.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.808
Relax.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.677
Maybe turn on a light.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.380
I recently read of a story,
a supposed true story,

33:03.382 --> 33:07.684
that takes place on the other
side of the pond, England.

33:07.686 --> 33:08.986
Scarecrow.

33:08.988 --> 33:09.886
Myth.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.121
Reality.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.257
I know what you may
all be thinking.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.425
Scarecrow, isn't that
just a stuffed costume

33:15.427 --> 33:17.627
that the farmer puts
out, stuffs with hay

33:17.629 --> 33:19.196
to scare away the scarecrows?

33:19.198 --> 33:20.764
But the actual origin
of the scarecrow

33:20.766 --> 33:22.432
has a whole lot more
to it than that.

33:22.434 --> 33:26.070
Now this supposed true
story takes place in 1991

33:26.072 --> 33:29.239
with a girl named June
whose parents were murdered.

33:29.241 --> 33:33.010
Now June is fully
convinced that a scarecrow

33:33.012 --> 33:36.213
killed her parents, but
from what I read though,

33:36.215 --> 33:38.615
it looks to be a
robbery that went wrong

33:38.617 --> 33:40.917
and the parents died and the
only people that survived

33:40.919 --> 33:44.121
were June and her brother,
that's what I could tell.

33:44.123 --> 33:48.392
Now, fast forward to
2016, 20 years later,

33:48.394 --> 33:50.594
on the anniversary of
her parents' death,

33:50.596 --> 33:55.132
June's brother gets found
dead of a supposed suicide

33:55.134 --> 33:58.368
on the same land where
her parents had died.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.870
So now, June, the very next day,

34:00.872 --> 34:03.340
after her brother has
died of apparent suicide,

34:03.342 --> 34:06.110
June, along with her best
friend and her therapist,

34:06.112 --> 34:09.815
Go to the house to
try and clean it up.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.172
Whoa.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.444
Oh, what a beautiful horse.

34:40.346 --> 34:41.179
Wow.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.430
Yo, where did you
find that?

35:00.432 --> 35:01.533
It was inside there.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.002
You think it was her nana's?

35:06.905 --> 35:09.741
- Maybe?
- Oh, sexy.

35:19.118 --> 35:20.850
Who the hell are you?

35:20.852 --> 35:22.454
You shouldn't be on this land.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.558
Our friend owns it.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.895
- Friend?
- May Sealey?

35:30.862 --> 35:32.596
The owner as of today.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.865
Who the hell are you?

35:34.733 --> 35:36.468
Young girl inherits a farm?

35:37.669 --> 35:38.970
Be careful in this period.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.872
You know the owners
went missing, right?

35:42.874 --> 35:44.108
Why don't you
get off this land

35:44.110 --> 35:45.509
before we call the cops here?

35:45.511 --> 35:47.077
I was here first!

35:47.079 --> 35:48.578
Yeah?

35:48.580 --> 35:50.247
And I bet the police would
like the hear that, too.

35:50.249 --> 35:54.086
Now, get your crap and get
the hell out of this land!

35:55.554 --> 35:58.021
Go and find a homeless
shelter or something.

35:58.023 --> 36:00.023
Why do you wanna sleep
in the farm anyway?

36:00.025 --> 36:01.425
Gross.

36:01.427 --> 36:02.892
Posh bitches.

36:02.894 --> 36:06.165
We're calling the cops in
five minutes, just get walking!

36:15.474 --> 36:16.308
Anya?

36:19.511 --> 36:20.346
Christine?

36:24.450 --> 36:25.284
Hello?

36:53.445 --> 36:54.280
Hello.

40:35.434 --> 40:37.369
Who's in there?

41:23.915 --> 41:24.914
No!

41:26.685 --> 41:28.353
No, don't take that!

42:36.121 --> 42:38.121
It's that time again.

42:38.123 --> 42:43.128
Once again, we are in
fear of his presence.

42:43.729 --> 42:45.361
Unable to leave.

42:45.363 --> 42:49.866
The curse of the scarecrow has
cursed our family for years,

42:49.868 --> 42:54.840
never allowing us to
move on, move forward.

42:56.041 --> 42:57.974
Trapped in a cycle
for generations

42:57.976 --> 43:00.345
to stop others from
becoming in danger.

43:01.513 --> 43:02.848
For decades.

43:04.215 --> 43:05.050
Every year.

43:06.151 --> 43:07.485
He returns.

43:09.454 --> 43:11.655
Our family has dedicated
years of our lives

43:11.657 --> 43:13.757
to protecting the secret.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.693
Never allowing others
to be hurt by the curse

43:16.695 --> 43:18.697
that was put on the land.

43:24.269 --> 43:27.606
I can't have my family harmed.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.912
But as my granddaughter
gets older in age,

43:35.346 --> 43:36.514
I fear.

43:39.551 --> 43:40.919
She needs to know.

43:43.555 --> 43:44.389
The truth.

44:34.606 --> 44:36.372
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, all good.

44:36.374 --> 44:37.375
Just clearin' up.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.076
You find anything upstairs?

44:40.078 --> 44:41.811
What have you got there?

44:41.813 --> 44:45.148
Just some stuff, you know,
stuff that was boxed away.

44:45.150 --> 44:46.482
Evidence?

44:46.484 --> 44:48.818
It was left out by the hallway.

44:48.820 --> 44:50.922
- What did you find?
- Well...

44:52.423 --> 44:54.624
People have gone missing
from this land before.

44:54.626 --> 44:56.895
As in, before the
people who lived here.

44:57.763 --> 44:58.864
More have vanished.

45:00.565 --> 45:01.631
Wait.

45:01.633 --> 45:02.567
Let me see.

45:03.735 --> 45:05.268
Babe, it's crazy,
check it out.

45:05.270 --> 45:07.671
Every year, even more
so than last year,

45:07.673 --> 45:09.639
people have gone
missing from this area.

45:09.641 --> 45:11.540
And not even just from here.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.009
Check out the map.

45:13.011 --> 45:17.115
In Essex, June Sommers,
Karen Gilbert, Nancy Strong.

45:18.784 --> 45:19.951
You know what's nuts?

45:21.119 --> 45:22.051
It's all been around
the same timeframe

45:22.053 --> 45:23.588
as your relatives gone missing.

45:27.693 --> 45:29.127
Could be a coincidence.

45:32.898 --> 45:34.632
What does the
reporter in you think?

45:38.236 --> 45:40.839
She thinks it's something
more than a coincidence.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.541
A cult maybe?

45:47.645 --> 45:50.115
Scarecrow?

45:52.117 --> 45:53.717
- A scarecrow?
- I know, I know.

45:53.719 --> 45:56.085
It's ridiculous as
hell.

45:56.087 --> 45:59.122
Babe, I couldn't make
it up, even if I tried.

45:59.124 --> 46:00.556
These people are crazy.

46:00.558 --> 46:03.461
They actually believe
that a scarecrow did it.

46:17.275 --> 46:18.376
Do you see what I see?

46:20.879 --> 46:22.513
- Deja vu, eh?
- Oh, my god.

46:23.982 --> 46:25.749
We look so alike.

46:25.751 --> 46:27.252
Crazy, isn't it?

46:31.990 --> 46:34.292
- I found this in the barn.
- Holy shit, May!

46:35.761 --> 46:36.960
Where did you find that?

46:36.962 --> 46:38.427
Well, I just found
it in the barn!

46:38.429 --> 46:40.431
Okay, okay.

46:41.566 --> 46:43.501
Let's just put it
somewhere safe, yeah?

46:52.043 --> 46:53.544
Let's go upstairs.

47:00.085 --> 47:03.152
- Which one do you prefer?
- I have no preference.

47:03.154 --> 47:05.456
I see you ladies
found the wine.

47:06.624 --> 47:08.491
Oh, she had some
expensive shit.

47:08.493 --> 47:09.795
Yeah, here, check it out

47:16.167 --> 47:19.035
- Where did you find this?
- It was out in the stables.

47:19.037 --> 47:22.305
Did you guys know that you
own a bunch of farm animals?

47:22.307 --> 47:23.909
I wonder whose this was?

47:25.510 --> 47:28.046
Come on, let's grab a drink.

47:39.057 --> 47:40.223
- You're going to France?
- Yeah.

47:40.225 --> 47:42.058
I've got this wicked apartment.

47:42.060 --> 47:43.559
- Wow.
- In Nice.

47:43.561 --> 47:45.094
When did you decide that,
when did you decide that?

47:45.096 --> 47:46.762
Well, a friend of mine gave
me this place for six months.

47:46.764 --> 47:49.367
So, have you told your
mom about the house?

47:50.869 --> 47:51.702
No.

47:52.904 --> 47:54.337
I don't think I'm
going to, either.

47:54.339 --> 47:58.074
Can I ask why?

47:58.076 --> 48:00.309
I just think with everything
that's happened it's probably

48:00.311 --> 48:04.280
best that we just carry on
leading separate lives, you know?

48:04.282 --> 48:07.283
This house is so cool.

48:07.285 --> 48:09.485
I'd seriously consider
selling it, you know.

48:09.487 --> 48:11.587
What
am I supposed to do?

48:11.589 --> 48:14.159
Leave the city and become
a little farm girl?

48:15.293 --> 48:16.625
What's
wrong with that?

48:16.627 --> 48:17.462
It could be fun.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.667
What have you got there?

48:24.669 --> 48:25.503
It's nothing

48:29.540 --> 48:31.007
Whoa.

48:31.009 --> 48:33.109
Holy shit, girl.

48:33.111 --> 48:34.510
Looks
like her twin, right?

48:34.512 --> 48:36.312
How strange to look
so alike with someone

48:36.314 --> 48:38.614
you've never actually met.

48:38.616 --> 48:40.649
Do you believe in reincarnation?

48:40.651 --> 48:42.351
- I dunno.
- I think it must be.

48:42.353 --> 48:45.924
I mean, there's gotta be
something more than just us.

48:46.925 --> 48:48.126
What if you are her?

48:49.794 --> 48:52.996
Well, if I am her, I
don't know that I am, do I?

48:52.998 --> 48:54.365
Do you know how she died?

48:56.968 --> 48:58.634
Long story.

48:58.636 --> 48:59.871
Explain, how?

49:00.738 --> 49:02.941
She was actually burnt alive.

49:03.875 --> 49:05.043
On this land.

49:06.677 --> 49:11.216
It was the early 1900s and
her husband, she was engaged,

49:12.117 --> 49:14.685
he was accused of being a thief,

49:15.887 --> 49:18.221
and she was painted
with the same brush.

49:18.223 --> 49:21.925
So they threw her in the barn
and they burnt her alive.

49:21.927 --> 49:23.659
God, holy crap.

49:23.661 --> 49:24.930
And her husband?

49:27.332 --> 49:29.534
Apparently he was
turned into a scarecrow.

49:30.868 --> 49:32.468
The legend of a
scarecrow comes from him.

49:32.470 --> 49:36.005
He was strung up like
a scarecrow, starved,

49:36.007 --> 49:37.907
and then pecked
to death by crows.

49:37.909 --> 49:40.111
My god, that's deep.

49:41.612 --> 49:42.447
Wait.

49:44.749 --> 49:45.716
I have an idea.

49:48.954 --> 49:50.321
What are we doing here?

49:55.560 --> 49:58.761
We are gonna try
to invoke the spirit.

49:58.763 --> 50:01.299
See if Mary-Lou walks
the barns anymore.

50:03.368 --> 50:05.270
Anya, stop.

50:07.672 --> 50:11.309
Nah, this is sick!

50:12.343 --> 50:13.511
Invoke spirit?

50:18.349 --> 50:22.418
It's probably total BS, but
when I was doing a write-up

50:22.420 --> 50:25.323
on spirits, we all
know I'm a believer,

50:26.224 --> 50:28.193
I read on how to invoke one.

50:29.927 --> 50:32.330
Trust me, it's total bullshit.

50:33.731 --> 50:36.899
No, come on, let's invoke
the spirit of that girl.

50:36.901 --> 50:38.736
The one that I look like.

50:39.604 --> 50:40.903
Anya.

50:40.905 --> 50:41.706
May.

50:45.643 --> 50:47.512
Let's all hold hands.

50:50.915 --> 50:53.851
Are you kidding me, are
we actually doing this?

50:56.887 --> 50:59.424
Come on, babe, it's
not gonna work anyway.

51:06.497 --> 51:09.732
I summon you with my hold.

51:09.734 --> 51:14.270
You who hold the sight
I see in the image.

51:14.272 --> 51:15.838
The body of God.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.076
The spirit of the devil.

51:19.244 --> 51:22.311
You who takes all
those who come.

51:22.313 --> 51:24.215
You who refuses no one.

51:25.583 --> 51:29.387
Our great lady who exacts
the price of blood.

51:30.355 --> 51:32.455
Mother and daughter.

51:32.457 --> 51:36.827
Destroy all the era and
transform the world.

51:39.130 --> 51:43.134
Come to me now and
change my life!

51:59.050 --> 52:03.654
Where did you get that
god-awful spell from?

52:04.789 --> 52:06.157
I got it online, okay?

52:18.703 --> 52:19.635
Told you.

52:19.637 --> 52:21.003
Total.

52:21.005 --> 52:22.205
Fucking.

52:22.207 --> 52:23.040
Bullshit.

52:23.941 --> 52:26.209
What do we do now?

52:29.680 --> 52:31.347
What
the fuck was that?

52:31.349 --> 52:34.252
Guys, I'm kinda
getting creeped out now.

52:35.253 --> 52:36.619
I wonder if it's the spirit.

52:37.622 --> 52:39.490
Alright, let's
get out of here.

53:03.814 --> 53:05.481
What the hell was that?

53:05.483 --> 53:07.850
I told you, my spell worked.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.587
That was no spell!

53:12.056 --> 53:14.592
So, what if the
scarecrow is real?

53:15.693 --> 53:16.492
Anya.

53:16.494 --> 53:17.328
No, come on.

53:18.596 --> 53:20.596
Usually I'm not the
supernatural believer,

53:20.598 --> 53:23.999
but they all vanished
on this land.

53:24.001 --> 53:26.101
I think that
was a coincidence.

53:26.103 --> 53:27.370
Okay, look, look.

53:27.372 --> 53:30.005
It's fine, it's fine, okay?

53:30.007 --> 53:32.475
Maybe just some
fucked up wiring.

53:32.477 --> 53:35.077
Look, we've all have
enough for the day.

53:35.079 --> 53:35.980
Let's hit the hay.

54:12.917 --> 54:15.017
You're so cute.

54:15.019 --> 54:16.652
What?

54:16.654 --> 54:17.588
The rose.

54:19.190 --> 54:21.590
I didn't get you no rose.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.226
Whatever.

54:23.228 --> 54:24.061
You know I love a romantic.

54:25.430 --> 54:26.795
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

54:26.797 --> 54:27.632
Okay.

54:32.169 --> 54:33.003
How you doing?

54:35.406 --> 54:36.339
I'm fine.

54:36.341 --> 54:37.174
Listen.

54:38.643 --> 54:41.379
I know it's a lot of shit to
deal with and it's not easy

54:42.780 --> 54:45.182
finding out about your
dad's side of the family,

54:46.351 --> 54:47.785
inheriting this house.

54:49.220 --> 54:50.087
I know it's hard.

54:52.122 --> 54:55.891
I just wanted to say that
I'm here with you, okay?

54:55.893 --> 54:56.992
Okay?

54:56.994 --> 54:58.294
Yeah.

54:58.296 --> 54:59.262
I know.

54:59.264 --> 55:01.131
You sure?

58:44.288 --> 58:46.722
Did you just see something?

58:46.724 --> 58:48.457
See what?

58:48.459 --> 58:52.196
I don't know, I swear
I just saw something.

58:53.363 --> 58:55.265
Babe,
there's nothing there.

59:08.913 --> 59:11.046
Anya, there isn't
a signal on my phone.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.450
Of course not, we're
in the middle of nowhere.

59:25.329 --> 59:26.695
What?

59:26.697 --> 59:28.196
Is this you?

59:28.198 --> 59:29.634
No.

59:34.639 --> 59:36.805
"You're invited to a wedding."

59:36.807 --> 59:41.812
I didn't write that.

59:51.088 --> 59:52.456
You're invited, too.

01:00:06.671 --> 01:00:09.907
I found this in
the bedroom earlier.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:14.679
What is it?

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:20.284
I, I think it's
some kind of journal.

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:24.722
It was my grandmother's, the
one that lived here before us.

01:00:26.824 --> 01:00:30.294
And it keeps an account of
the time that she spent here.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:34.965
But the weirdest bit
about it is that...

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:37.733
Go on, babe, what is it?

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:40.769
It's saying the same stuff
that you discovered earlier/

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:43.338
It's saying she was
protecting this land

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.075
so no one could get hurt again.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:50.014
It was saying that people
died under the hands of him.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:54.084
Him being?

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:55.953
The scarecrow.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:41.932
Why is May outside so late?

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:49.940
Let me check.

01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:15.900
She says he rises
every 48 hours.

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:20.204
May!

01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:46.463
Dude, what's with the music?

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:53.802
I didn't turn it on.

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:54.905
Why is May outside?

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:57.374
- Outside?
- Yeah!

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:01.311
Come on.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:20.630
What the fuck?

01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:23.700
I saw her.

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:26.136
Right here.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:29.239
How'd you know?

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:32.977
I saw
her from my window.

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:35.010
Window?

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:37.045
Let me check the house.

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:23.120
May?

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:45.569
I didn't turn this on.

01:07:12.096 --> 01:07:13.461
Holy straw.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:19.395
Fuck.

01:08:26.136 --> 01:08:26.970
Please.

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:57.932
Don't, don't, don't.

01:08:57.934 --> 01:08:58.902
Who is it?

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:02.139
Who's there?

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:07.176
Darren, what the
hell is going on?

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:12.514
I don't think
you'll believe me.

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:17.520
I don't believe myself.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:24.627
Darren.

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.665
Darren, where the hell
did you find this?

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:33.568
Listen, take this and
shoot anything that you see.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:36.804
- What the hell is going on?
- Go, Christine.

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:33.695
Anya!

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:36.564
Anya, what the, where's
May, is she okay?

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:40.635
- Get out of here.
- May, where's May?

01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:43.540
Come on, bitch, see
what mama's got for ya.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:37.687
Help me!

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:41.491
Someone help me!

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:43.727
Help!

01:12:45.295 --> 01:12:49.132
Help!

01:13:42.552 --> 01:13:44.586
That's not me.

01:13:44.588 --> 01:13:47.755
That's not me, that's not me.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.256
I'm not her.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.058
No, no, no, no!

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.929
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:55.799
It is me.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.334
Remember?

01:14:00.336 --> 01:14:01.104
Mary-Lou.

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:03.440
I died but I'm back now.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:08.645
I saw what they did to you.

01:14:09.813 --> 01:14:11.178
I was watching,
I saw everything.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.247
They killed you for
something that you didn't do.

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:14.350
I saw it all.

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:18.855
They strung you up
and they starved you.

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:23.092
And I saw what the crows did.

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:27.797
They pecked you to
death, I'm so sorry.

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:30.066
I'm so sorry.

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:34.438
I've missed you.

01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:41.010
I've missed you.

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:16.760
I'm the only one taking
this bitch down the aisle.

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.414
He's gone.

01:18:40.884 --> 01:18:42.218
What was that?

01:18:45.822 --> 01:18:48.692
He thinks I'm that
girl from the photo.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:52.126
- Who is she?
- Mary-Lou!

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:55.496
The one who was murdered
in the early 1900s.

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:57.732
It's the curse of the scarecrow.

01:18:57.734 --> 01:19:02.103
It said that Anthony Web
was tied up in the cornfield

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:04.972
by the locals and
starved to death,

01:19:04.974 --> 01:19:07.775
and then his
wife-to-be, Mary-Lou,

01:19:07.777 --> 01:19:10.712
was burnt alive in the barn.

01:19:10.714 --> 01:19:13.516
They were both murdered by
the locals by fear of theft!

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:17.453
And Mary-Lou?

01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:19.588
- You're related?
- Yeah!

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:23.357
Apparently my bloodline has
been protecting this curse

01:19:23.359 --> 01:19:27.261
of the scarecrow for years
making sure no one else got hurt!

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:30.299
- Well, something happened!
- Yeah, they were all killed!

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:35.602
How do we stop it?

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.540
I don't think we can.

01:19:38.842 --> 01:19:39.675
May?

01:19:41.177 --> 01:19:42.376
Why was he trying to marry you?

01:19:42.378 --> 01:19:44.445
Because he wants Mary-Lou.

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:46.649
He actually thinks
that I am her.

01:19:59.262 --> 01:20:01.395
I don't think we can stop it.

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:03.630
It says here that'll he'll
attack anyone on this land,

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.902
still thinking he's in
the time of his death.

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:12.807
Wait, "anyone who
faces the scarecrow

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:15.877
"must see it through
the 48 hours.

01:20:15.879 --> 01:20:20.714
"Each hour of the curse is
each hour until he died.

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:25.654
"Once the 48 hours is up,
the curse will be no more."

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:29.456
We only have to wait 48 hours
for the curse to be over.

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:30.724
For goodness sake.

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:32.226
We don't know when the
48 hours begun, mate.

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:35.562
Well, then we need to
get the hell out of here!

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:37.801
I'll grab the keys, then.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.645
He wants me to be his bride.

01:20:58.054 --> 01:20:58.855
Darren!

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:04.760
Get out of here.

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:39.422
May!

01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:44.260
May!

01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:46.329
Oh, fuck.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.133
May!

01:22:52.235 --> 01:22:53.036
May!

01:23:07.383 --> 01:23:09.285
May, what're you doing?

01:23:10.853 --> 01:23:11.687
May!

01:23:17.593 --> 01:23:18.993
Stop!

01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:19.961
May!

01:23:19.963 --> 01:23:21.495
What're you doing?

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.166
You want Mary-Lou?

01:23:24.267 --> 01:23:25.699
Stop.

01:23:25.701 --> 01:23:26.502
Stop!

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.909
I have to do this, Darren.

01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:37.078
This won't stop.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.046
I have to do this.

01:23:39.048 --> 01:23:39.981
May.

01:23:39.983 --> 01:23:40.814
Please!

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:42.151
It won't stop.

01:23:44.153 --> 01:23:44.988
May, no!

01:23:46.155 --> 01:23:47.921
- May, please!
- Shush.

01:23:47.923 --> 01:23:50.693
This won't stop
until I stop this.

01:23:51.995 --> 01:23:54.297
He won't stop until
he's with Mary-Lou.

01:23:55.398 --> 01:23:57.700
In life and in death.

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:01.004
I'm so sorry, Darren.

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:06.974
May!

01:24:06.976 --> 01:24:08.077
I love you.

01:24:09.678 --> 01:24:10.946
Please, babe.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:13.616
Don't leave me!

01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:22.389
Shut the door, Darren.

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:24.227
Shut the door, Darren!

01:24:25.628 --> 01:24:26.462
May, no.

01:24:28.331 --> 01:24:29.165
May!

01:24:32.535 --> 01:24:33.536
I'm sorry.

01:24:40.443 --> 01:24:45.448
You are not alone anymore.

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:36.825
May the curse
rest here forever.

01:26:57.148 --> 01:27:02.148
