illness, that much is true,

from drought and starvation.

19:04.311 --> 19:08.279
Your people are suffering and dying.

carts stocked with bread,

19:19.726 --> 19:21.794
millet, and wine...

19:21.795 --> 19:25.931

19:48.922 --> 19:51.424
I will burn the fields.

19:51.425 --> 19:53.926
I will burn our grain.

19:53.927 --> 19:56.561

20:24.825 --> 20:28.360

intends to send against us?

20:28.361 --> 20:30.563
Yes.

know your thoughts.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.094
They know your heart.

21:35.095 --> 21:36.896

21:36.897 --> 21:39.031

21:39.032 --> 21:42.134

When this war is over,

High Priest,

22:24.611 --> 22:28.346
The High Priest moves against
you in your absence.

22:29.983 --> 22:32.017
He should be arrested.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.687
That will not quell his influence.

The High Priest and his army

are more powerful than
Horemheb's entire infantry.

I will deal with him
soon enough, carefully.

he's right.

23:05.852 --> 23:08.988

23:08.989 --> 23:11.523
will watch as I leave for battle tomorrow.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.926
They'll see if I'm the first
to lose this sacred land.

23:18.131 --> 23:21.700
Yet here, here is my tomb.

Truth is a matter of perception, my King,

way to answer your question.

or fashioned for the gods,

1,000 years from now it will have vanished.

23:55.335 --> 23:56.735

Yes.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.386
Yes.

24:14.387 --> 24:17.022

24:19.726 --> 24:22.428

that they intended to come,
another misunderstanding.

45:44.642 --> 45:46.643
I left the palace to find them.

45:46.644 --> 45:49.513
I...

45:49.514 --> 45:51.915
I remember being mistaken for others

45:51.916 --> 45:54.418
who were being taken into the quarantine.

45:54.419 --> 45:57.888
After that I can't remember anything.

45:57.889 --> 45:59.790
If you're concerned that the Pharaoh

45:59.791 --> 46:01.892
will hold you responsible,

46:01.893 --> 46:03.926
I will tell him the truth.

46:05.363 --> 46:07.397
The Pharaoh will be angry with you

46:07.398 --> 46:11.100
if he learns you put
yourself in harm's way.

46:12.604 --> 46:16.707
I will tell him I encouraged you to go.

46:16.708 --> 46:18.142
I will pray for mercy.

46:18.143 --> 46:19.776
He will grant it,

46:19.777 --> 46:22.446
and that will be the end of the matter.

46:22.447 --> 46:24.615
I know why you're doing this,

46:24.616 --> 46:27.350
to once again try and protect me.

46:30.688 --> 46:32.055
When the Pharaoh returns,

46:32.056 --> 46:36.994
I will say nothing about any of it.

46:36.995 --> 46:40.697
It will remain a mystery.

46:40.698 --> 46:42.698
That will be the end of it.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.039
Out.

46:58.416 --> 47:00.050
She knows.

47:00.051 --> 47:01.552
She told you?

47:01.553 --> 47:04.188
No, she's too clever for that.

47:04.189 --> 47:06.690
She puts the blame on herself,
but she was testing me.

47:06.691 --> 47:08.192
She knows what happened.

47:08.193 --> 47:09.927
She's going to reveal
it all to the Pharaoh.

47:09.928 --> 47:12.161
Are you sure that you're
not being paranoid?

47:15.366 --> 47:17.734
Did she implicate me?

47:17.735 --> 47:20.671
Perhaps she's telling the
truth and she knows nothing.

47:20.672 --> 47:23.172
I saw it in her eyes.

47:25.877 --> 47:28.794
As you so valiantly told me...

47:31.716 --> 47:34.116
We mustn't expose ourselves needlessly.

47:37.065 --> 47:40.156
I don't think she's that clever.

47:52.136 --> 47:54.203
My Lady?

47:55.940 --> 47:57.174
Nahkt.

47:57.175 --> 47:59.243
I didn't mean to scare you.

47:59.244 --> 48:01.411
What are you doing here?

48:01.412 --> 48:03.113
You'd rather I leave?

48:03.114 --> 48:05.782
No.

48:05.783 --> 48:08.151
No, I'm happy to see you.

48:08.152 --> 48:09.920
I'm just surprised.

48:09.921 --> 48:13.257
I wanted to see how you were feeling.

48:13.258 --> 48:16.693
We're friends, I thought.

48:16.694 --> 48:18.461
We are.

48:23.434 --> 48:25.836
Nahkt, will you help me?

48:25.837 --> 48:27.336
Anything.

48:29.974 --> 48:33.977
I need to deliver a message to the Pharaoh

48:33.978 --> 48:35.646
before his return.

48:35.647 --> 48:37.481
Only my father has permission

48:37.482 --> 48:39.750
to send correspondence to the Pharaoh.

48:39.751 --> 48:41.752
But you could find a way.

48:41.753 --> 48:44.955
You're the Vizier's son.

48:44.956 --> 48:46.990
What is the message that's so important

48:46.991 --> 48:48.425
that it has to be sent now?

48:48.426 --> 48:51.495
I don't want to tell you.

48:51.496 --> 48:53.330
Does your father really control you

48:53.331 --> 48:56.400
the way he controls everyone else?

48:56.401 --> 48:57.834
Of course he does.

48:57.835 --> 48:59.670
Not if you don't want him to.

48:59.671 --> 49:03.273
I carry the Pharaoh's heir.

49:03.274 --> 49:06.510
I'll be made queen.

49:06.511 --> 49:08.878
Nahkt, please.

49:12.517 --> 49:15.719
You will not tell him?

49:15.720 --> 49:18.070
I will not tell the Vizier most of all.

49:47.652 --> 49:49.319
You seek prayer?

49:49.320 --> 49:51.388
You've made your proclamation.

49:51.389 --> 49:52.489
It is the will of the gods.

49:52.490 --> 49:54.091
It is the will of the people.

49:54.092 --> 49:56.526
My priests are ready, Vizier.

49:56.527 --> 49:58.061
Are you?

49:58.062 --> 50:00.664
I am here to reaffirm past promises.

50:00.665 --> 50:03.667
Akhenaten's religion dies with Tutankhamun.

50:03.668 --> 50:06.069
You will keep your temples
and your priests.

50:06.070 --> 50:08.205
They will be yours to command.

50:08.206 --> 50:10.240
This pleases the gods.

50:10.241 --> 50:12.209
You will be well rewarded.

50:12.210 --> 50:14.144
But this cannot be done alone.

50:14.145 --> 50:16.680
Others have reason to see the
Pharaoh removed from power,

50:16.681 --> 50:18.849
others who can be used to our advantage.

50:18.850 --> 50:21.785
You speak of General Horemheb.

50:21.786 --> 50:25.021
His ambitions are not
consistent with my own.

50:25.022 --> 50:28.492
Once it is done, he too can be removed.

50:28.493 --> 50:30.394
You have the general's ear?

50:30.395 --> 50:32.062
I will.

50:32.063 --> 50:34.350
Do not make a move until I say it is time,

50:34.351 --> 50:35.422
you understand?

50:46.811 --> 50:50.380
The festival of Ra will be in place?

50:50.381 --> 50:54.517
A day we will all celebrate
for years to come.

51:12.937 --> 51:15.738
Suhad asked me to have this
delivered to the Pharaoh.

51:18.276 --> 51:20.944
Do you know what it says?

51:20.945 --> 51:23.212
Should I read it to you?

51:27.151 --> 51:28.785
Lies.

51:28.786 --> 51:30.720
No, they're not.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.255
Then why didn't you send it?

51:32.256 --> 51:34.324
Are you going to kill her, like she says,

51:34.325 --> 51:36.793
to ensure there is no heir
when you kill the Pharaoh?

51:36.794 --> 51:39.196
You think I would plot to kill our king?

51:39.197 --> 51:41.730
Are you going to kill her?

51:48.406 --> 51:52.976
Yes, I am.

51:52.977 --> 51:55.212
For reasons you fully understand.

51:55.213 --> 51:56.379
Like you killed my mother.

51:56.380 --> 51:57.380
I loved your mother.

51:57.381 --> 51:58.748
Did you kill her?

51:58.749 --> 51:59.950
No, Son.

51:59.951 --> 52:01.818
You despised her for what she did.

52:01.819 --> 52:04.321
I despised myself for not
giving her the happiness

52:04.322 --> 52:05.755
of a child.

52:05.756 --> 52:08.458
She hated herself more
for what then happened.

52:08.459 --> 52:11.862
She took poison.

52:11.863 --> 52:13.830
That's how she died.

52:13.831 --> 52:15.365
She took her own life.

52:15.366 --> 52:18.702
She wouldn't have left me.

52:18.703 --> 52:21.538
She wasn't of sound mind.

52:21.539 --> 52:24.974
She was not of sound mind.

52:28.145 --> 52:31.982
You're still my son.

52:31.983 --> 52:35.886
You'll be by my side,

52:35.887 --> 52:37.136
together.

52:42.727 --> 52:45.728
What are you going to do?

52:48.399 --> 52:51.116
I was raised by you, Father.

52:55.706 --> 52:58.274
Do you really think I was her friend?

53:00.545 --> 53:02.012
I liked her,

53:02.013 --> 53:04.247
but how could I be her friend

53:04.248 --> 53:07.450
when she carries an heir?

53:07.451 --> 53:11.655
The Queen will never have a child,

53:11.656 --> 53:16.659
which leaves only me when you are Pharaoh.

53:48.081 --> 53:49.825
I will need your help.

a thousand lies to myself, Brother.

But I'm tired of lying.

01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:45.947
I was protecting us.

You were protecting us?

Our blood,

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.089
our dynasty,

01:00:56.090 --> 01:01:00.159
just as you did when you killed Ka.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.095
Ka left me for dead.

She did the same thing to me

the moment she came into this palace.

01:01:08.669 --> 01:01:11.971
She was with my child.

01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:15.174
Were you to have a Mitanni heir?

01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:17.944
Was that to be your dynasty?

01:01:17.945 --> 01:01:20.012
I loved her.

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:27.019
When has that ever mattered?

01:01:30.791 --> 01:01:35.161
You know in your heart

01:01:35.162 --> 01:01:37.997
that you could never be with her.

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:40.265
You are wrong.

01:01:43.704 --> 01:01:46.571
She was all I had left in my heart.

01:01:48.976 --> 01:01:50.409
Imprison her.

01:01:56.016 --> 01:02:00.353
When the festival is concluded
and the people of this city

01:02:00.354 --> 01:02:04.991
once again bask in the
glory of their kingdom,

01:02:04.992 --> 01:02:08.860
they will bear witness to your execution.

01:02:10.264 --> 01:02:12.398
No! No! No.

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:19.203
No, no.

01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:39.757
Lagus.

01:02:43.363 --> 01:02:47.132
Stay close to him, please.

01:02:47.133 --> 01:02:49.400
I will not leave his side again.

01:03:12.525 --> 01:03:15.728
Such a thin line

01:03:15.729 --> 01:03:17.997
between life and death...

01:03:17.998 --> 01:03:21.232
a reminder of just how fragile we are.

01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:27.940
So much vibrancy, youthful energy.

01:03:27.941 --> 01:03:31.543
Seems so little next to
the will of the gods.

01:03:31.544 --> 01:03:35.547
If this was indeed the will of the gods,

01:03:35.548 --> 01:03:38.384
all the more reason to abandon them.

01:03:38.385 --> 01:03:41.253
Or to heed their wrath.

01:03:41.254 --> 01:03:44.223
This is proof they do not sit idle.

01:03:44.224 --> 01:03:47.760
Nor will I, while you turn
my people against me.

01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:50.429
They are not against you, my Lord.

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:54.233
They merely stand for something
that transcends us all.

01:03:54.234 --> 01:03:58.203
And soon they will be free
from your subjugation.

01:03:58.204 --> 01:04:01.572
Protection, Pharaoh Tutankhamun.

01:04:03.243 --> 01:04:06.211
Shame it was not offered to her,

01:04:06.212 --> 01:04:08.213
but then...

01:04:08.214 --> 01:04:11.917
she was not a person of faith, was she?

01:04:11.918 --> 01:04:14.219
Yes, she was,

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.222
but it was her own...

01:04:17.223 --> 01:04:20.090
not imposed by a false prophet.

01:04:20.091 --> 01:04:21.260
You speak blasphemy.

01:04:21.261 --> 01:04:23.228
Then tell your gods to strike me down!

01:04:23.229 --> 01:04:26.465
Tell them I am waiting!

01:04:26.466 --> 01:04:27.558
Until they do,

01:04:27.559 --> 01:04:29.801
continue your preparations
for the festival.

01:04:33.177 --> 01:04:37.576
And pray to those gods
for your own protection.

01:04:37.577 --> 01:04:39.511
No.

01:04:39.512 --> 01:04:43.082
I will pray for yours,

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:45.183
as I always have.

01:05:05.004 --> 01:05:08.340
He would have known...

01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:11.043
even if he hadn't seen the bruises.

01:05:11.044 --> 01:05:13.045
I said I would protect you.

01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:16.532
Protect what?

01:05:16.533 --> 01:05:19.384
He'll never look at me the same way again.

01:05:19.385 --> 01:05:21.787
Soon that may not matter.

01:05:21.788 --> 01:05:23.421
Whatever you're scheming...

01:05:27.794 --> 01:05:32.564
There are forces at work
beyond even my control.

01:05:32.565 --> 01:05:35.300
You did what you had to do.

01:05:35.301 --> 01:05:39.037
So must I.

01:05:39.038 --> 01:05:41.590
Do not hurt him, Ay.

01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:45.778
He's already a wounded man.

01:05:45.779 --> 01:05:48.946
There are some wounds
that cannot be healed.

01:06:20.113 --> 01:06:24.383
You cannot continue to stand
on this leg, my Lord.

01:06:24.384 --> 01:06:26.351
I have little choice.

01:06:26.352 --> 01:06:31.356
Then you are choosing
between life and death.

01:06:31.357 --> 01:06:35.360
He's right. You must rest.

01:06:35.361 --> 01:06:37.029
Let the medicine work.

01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:38.530
He will be carried.

01:06:38.531 --> 01:06:40.866
The Pharaoh is in grave danger.

01:06:40.867 --> 01:06:42.201
Yes, he is.

01:06:42.202 --> 01:06:43.902
There can be no delay.

01:06:43.903 --> 01:06:45.737
Is everything in order?

01:06:45.738 --> 01:06:48.207
Yes.

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:52.277
The people yearn to celebrate
their king's victory.

01:06:52.278 --> 01:06:56.248
They need to see you are
unscathed from battle.

01:06:56.249 --> 01:06:57.748
Except he's not.

01:06:59.352 --> 01:07:01.954
Ay is right, Lagus.

01:07:01.955 --> 01:07:05.143
This only works when the High Priest

01:07:05.144 --> 01:07:08.594
makes his move. I cannot show any weakness.

01:07:08.595 --> 01:07:11.063
By nightfall, this will be over.

01:07:11.064 --> 01:07:14.166
By nightfall, you will be dead.

01:07:14.167 --> 01:07:16.602
I'll have the litter ready.

01:07:16.603 --> 01:07:18.904
Cover the wound.

01:07:18.905 --> 01:07:20.838
No one can know.

01:07:30.984 --> 01:07:35.020
I don't share your trust in him.

01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:37.322
I know his ambitions,

01:07:37.323 --> 01:07:42.193
but we cannot do this without him.

01:07:48.968 --> 01:07:52.853
Now come, help me dress.

01:07:56.943 --> 01:07:59.544
It's a very simple question, General.

01:07:59.545 --> 01:08:01.380
Do you want him dead?

01:08:01.381 --> 01:08:04.950
That's not a simple question, Priest.

01:08:04.951 --> 01:08:07.686
You will bleed if he remains in power.

01:08:07.687 --> 01:08:09.988
You've heard what the Vizier said.

01:08:09.989 --> 01:08:13.025
He has not forgiven you for treason.

01:08:13.026 --> 01:08:15.294
He intends to move on us both,

01:08:15.295 --> 01:08:17.412
and we must strike first.

01:08:17.412 --> 01:08:19.898
Once he's gone, you'll have your army.

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:22.000
The question remains.

01:08:22.001 --> 01:08:23.801
Do you want him dead?

01:08:23.803 --> 01:08:26.505
Do you want me to kill him?

01:08:26.506 --> 01:08:29.006
It will not be enough to
kill only Tutankhamun.

01:08:29.008 --> 01:08:30.559
Everyone loyal to him...

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.845
Ministers, personal guards, servants...

01:08:33.845 --> 01:08:37.515
They must all be eliminated simultaneously.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.089
Do you agree?

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:47.292
General?

01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:49.161
Agreed.

01:08:49.162 --> 01:08:51.330
You will strike against the palace.

01:08:51.331 --> 01:08:53.698
My priests will converge on the Pharaoh.

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:55.033
He will see you coming.

01:08:55.033 --> 01:08:56.667
I don't think you appreciate

01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:59.203
my unique position within this city.

01:08:59.205 --> 01:09:03.241
My priests are one with the people.

01:09:03.242 --> 01:09:06.178
But the Pharaoh must be exposed.

01:09:06.179 --> 01:09:08.580
I've already seen to that.

01:09:08.581 --> 01:09:10.415
Will your men carry this out?

01:09:10.416 --> 01:09:12.718
Will yours?

01:09:12.719 --> 01:09:15.220
It's one thing to take
a man's soul, Priest.

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.388
Quite another to take his life.

01:09:19.024 --> 01:09:24.595
My priests are more versed than you think.

01:09:24.596 --> 01:09:27.265
The festival begins shortly.

01:09:27.265 --> 01:09:29.468
Try and stay sober.

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:32.136

There is no way to save him?

01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:14.891
He is in the hands of the gods.

01:17:14.892 --> 01:17:17.226
Then give him peace.

free from all her enemies.

The most treacherous enemy of all

There is no real truth in this world...

01:19:31.028 --> 01:19:33.896
Only one's perception of it.

There is not much time.

01:20:52.676 --> 01:20:55.260
I know you haven't forgiven me.

01:20:58.916 --> 01:21:02.651

I'm allowed to see you.

For what purpose?

01:21:27.645 --> 01:21:31.047
I was not a builder of great monuments,

01:21:31.048 --> 01:21:34.450
not a conqueror of great lands.

01:21:36.504 --> 01:21:39.322

who understood the dignity of other men,

01:21:52.903 --> 01:21:56.339

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.875
the blood of his own

01:21:58.876 --> 01:22:01.211

a pharaoh...

01:22:04.548 --> 01:22:07.851
who ruled not for himself

01:22:07.852 --> 01:22:10.285
but for his people.

01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:15.358
