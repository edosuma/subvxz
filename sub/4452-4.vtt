00:00.302 --> 00:01.585
<i>Previously on Cedar Cove... </i>

00:01.587 --> 00:03.885
Grace asked me to run
the town event committee.

00:03.898 --> 00:06.335
You want something from
me that I can't give you.

00:06.384 --> 00:07.616
What, forgiveness?

00:07.618 --> 00:08.584
I feel like I'm cheating on Jack.

00:08.586 --> 00:10.085
How?

00:10.087 --> 00:12.154
There's a problem with the investors.

00:12.156 --> 00:14.757
So, you want to hire
me to be your assistant?

00:15.562 --> 00:19.495
Hey. Boy, you weren't easy to catch up to,

00:19.497 --> 00:20.579
but I, too, have been known

00:20.581 --> 00:23.132
to take out my frustrations
on the pavement.

00:23.134 --> 00:24.683
I'm not frustrated.

00:24.685 --> 00:25.985
[Laughs] Okay.

00:28.239 --> 00:29.805
Well, I'm a little frustrated

00:29.807 --> 00:32.141
by a certain defense attorney.

00:32.143 --> 00:34.943
But you can help if you have
time for a sit down later today?

00:34.945 --> 00:36.445
Sure.

00:36.447 --> 00:37.646
I've got a final divorce
decree this morning,

00:37.648 --> 00:39.982
but if you're free this afternoon?

00:39.984 --> 00:41.216
I am.

00:41.218 --> 00:42.718
I don't envy you.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.320
Envy me?

00:44.322 --> 00:45.504
I think I became a D.A.

00:45.506 --> 00:47.506
so I wouldn't have to handle divorce cases.

00:47.508 --> 00:48.524
[Laughs]

00:48.526 --> 00:50.275
That's a bit extreme.

00:50.277 --> 00:51.510
Divorce

00:51.512 --> 00:53.429
is a bottomless pit of hatred

00:53.431 --> 00:54.963
binding two people together

00:54.965 --> 00:58.100
whose only goal is to inflict
emotional and financial pain

00:58.102 --> 01:01.253
on someone they swore
they'd love until death.

01:01.255 --> 01:02.638
If you ask my opinion.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.241
Wow, so, a personal or
professional observation?

01:06.243 --> 01:07.409
Uh, both.

01:07.411 --> 01:09.128
Not observational. Fact.

01:09.130 --> 01:10.979
No, observation, not fact.

01:10.981 --> 01:13.449
And yes, a lot of divorces end up ugly,

01:13.451 --> 01:14.683
but most of the time,

01:14.685 --> 01:16.402
it's just about distribution of assets

01:16.404 --> 01:17.670
accrued during a marriage.

01:17.672 --> 01:22.358
A divorce is an autopsy of a marriage.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.326
Said the pessimist.

01:24.328 --> 01:25.761
Oh, and I suppose

01:25.763 --> 01:28.163
you had one of those "amicable" divorces?

01:28.165 --> 01:30.466
You did!

01:30.468 --> 01:31.266
I thought they were just legend.

01:31.268 --> 01:32.468
[Chuckling]

01:34.505 --> 01:35.988
Do you want to talk about it?

01:37.875 --> 01:39.375
Well, we already are,

01:39.377 --> 01:41.076
aren't we?

01:42.146 --> 01:42.778
Um...

01:46.100 --> 01:48.984
A great woman,

01:48.986 --> 01:51.587
but she has issues.

01:51.589 --> 01:53.355
And I thought I could change her...

01:53.357 --> 01:54.356
I know.

01:54.358 --> 01:57.526
Or... save her.

01:59.397 --> 02:03.182
And I failed on both fronts.

02:03.184 --> 02:05.284
Do you regret it?

02:06.804 --> 02:09.621
Well, at this point in my life,

02:09.622 --> 02:10.589
I didn't think I'd be living

02:10.591 --> 02:12.808
in a three-star hotel, alone,

02:12.810 --> 02:16.078
eating cold takeout every night, so...

02:16.080 --> 02:18.097
I regret that.

02:18.099 --> 02:20.783
But I've come to realize

02:20.785 --> 02:24.119
that if you're with the wrong person...

02:24.121 --> 02:26.488
You're alone anyway.

02:28.225 --> 02:31.610
Okay, well, no more takeout for you.

02:31.612 --> 02:32.561
No more? [Laughs]

02:32.563 --> 02:33.662
Yeah. You have to go

02:33.664 --> 02:34.963
to the Time & Tide bed and breakfast,

02:34.965 --> 02:35.964
and tell them that I sent you.

02:35.966 --> 02:36.999
Okay.

02:37.001 --> 02:38.167
And they will take really good care of you,

02:38.169 --> 02:39.435
and they'll feed you.

02:39.437 --> 02:40.736
- Food, too?
- Yeah!

03:09.467 --> 03:10.849
You look awful.

03:10.851 --> 03:12.868
[Scoffs] Thank you.

03:12.870 --> 03:14.753
No, really bad.

03:15.723 --> 03:17.105
Okay, got it.

03:17.107 --> 03:18.824
Gonna tell me?

03:18.826 --> 03:21.627
Olivia and I had a bad fight,

03:21.629 --> 03:26.081
and I have two deadlines
at two different papers.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.966
Well, you can't push
her to move in with you

03:27.968 --> 03:29.551
just to make yourself
feel better, you know.

03:29.553 --> 03:31.386
I'm not pushing her.

03:33.507 --> 03:34.973
Okay, maybe I'm pushing, a little.

03:34.975 --> 03:36.859
Yeah.

03:36.861 --> 03:39.595
I just don't want to lose her, Bob.

03:41.682 --> 03:44.366
30, 40 years ago, if you loved a woman,

03:44.368 --> 03:46.134
the only way you could live with her

03:46.136 --> 03:48.470
was with a priest and a reception,

03:48.472 --> 03:50.472
or if she was your mother.

03:50.474 --> 03:52.691
We're not a couple of kids, Bob.

03:52.693 --> 03:54.209
We've both been married before, remember.

03:54.211 --> 03:55.327
And divorced.

03:55.329 --> 03:57.880
Just give her some space, hmm?

03:57.882 --> 04:01.950
And time for her to trust you again.

04:01.952 --> 04:03.769
She'll find her way back to you.

04:03.771 --> 04:05.454
And if she doesn't?

04:05.456 --> 04:07.573
You got to have faith.

04:08.626 --> 04:10.392
Yeah.

04:10.394 --> 04:11.927
Hey, I was just wondering,

04:11.929 --> 04:12.945
who's that new guy

04:12.947 --> 04:14.596
that I keep seeing with Olivia?

04:14.598 --> 04:16.732
You mean, Paul? The new D.A.?

04:16.733 --> 04:18.000
Yeah.

04:18.002 --> 04:20.536
He seems a little too friendly.

04:20.538 --> 04:24.172
I'm not sure I like the cut of his jib.

04:24.174 --> 04:26.742
He has a bad jib, does he?

04:26.744 --> 04:28.377
You just watch him.

04:30.247 --> 04:31.980
Okay.

04:31.982 --> 04:34.383
I will watch him and his jib.

04:40.190 --> 04:41.640
I have decided

04:41.642 --> 04:44.059
on what will be my
first official act for me

04:44.061 --> 04:45.260
as town manager,

04:45.262 --> 04:47.129
and your first act as town event manager.

04:47.131 --> 04:48.196
Great.

04:48.198 --> 04:50.999
We are going to take a group photo

04:51.001 --> 04:53.001
of everyone in Cedar Cove!

04:53.003 --> 04:54.503
The whole town?

04:54.505 --> 04:55.504
Yes!

04:55.506 --> 04:56.471
We are going to meet tonight

04:56.473 --> 04:57.739
at dusk,

04:57.741 --> 04:58.907
at the marina.

04:58.909 --> 05:01.443
We are going to form a big group, and...

05:01.445 --> 05:02.444
[imitates a shutter clicking]

05:02.446 --> 05:03.412
Picture!

05:03.414 --> 05:04.379
End of story.

05:04.381 --> 05:05.681
Right? Right?

05:05.683 --> 05:07.349
Tonight?

05:07.351 --> 05:08.567
Why so fast?

05:08.569 --> 05:10.419
Yeah, well, I kind of, you know,

05:10.421 --> 05:11.653
got ahead of myself a bit,

05:11.655 --> 05:13.105
because I sent out the e-mail

05:13.107 --> 05:15.624
- before I...
- Thought it through?

05:15.626 --> 05:18.393
I could really use a
whole lot more "can do"

05:18.395 --> 05:21.096
and a little less "can't do" from you.

05:33.627 --> 05:34.743
Hey.

05:34.745 --> 05:35.677
What are you doing here?

05:35.679 --> 05:37.112
Reporting for work.

05:37.114 --> 05:38.196
First day.

05:38.198 --> 05:39.748
Oh, right.

05:39.750 --> 05:40.849
The job.

05:40.851 --> 05:42.434
Did we set a time?

05:42.436 --> 05:44.152
Yes, an hour ago.

05:44.154 --> 05:45.621
[Sighs] My bad.

05:45.623 --> 05:48.640
Um, have you had breakfast?

05:48.642 --> 05:49.841
It's lunchtime.

05:49.843 --> 05:52.160
That's an excellent point.

05:52.162 --> 05:53.578
Uh, why don't I put my stuff away,

05:53.580 --> 05:55.347
and then we'll figure out what's what.

06:04.475 --> 06:05.474
Hey.

06:05.476 --> 06:07.042
Come on in.

06:07.044 --> 06:08.410
You look busy.

06:08.412 --> 06:11.580
New job, just doing 12 things at once.

06:11.582 --> 06:13.532
How's that working for you?

06:13.534 --> 06:15.951
Great.

06:15.953 --> 06:17.836
I, uh, could live
without my boss sometimes,

06:17.838 --> 06:19.354
but everyone says that, right?

06:21.275 --> 06:23.091
You okay?

06:23.093 --> 06:25.260
No, not really.

06:25.262 --> 06:26.695
It's Warren.

06:26.697 --> 06:27.929
[Scoffs]

06:27.931 --> 06:29.965
Warren...

06:29.967 --> 06:32.567
If only we could run people out of town

06:32.569 --> 06:34.403
with pitchforks and torches, huh?

06:34.405 --> 06:36.338
Actually, with Warren,

06:36.340 --> 06:38.740
I could get a group together
like that... [Snaps fingers]

06:38.742 --> 06:42.377
He's blackmailing me, or threatening to.

06:43.747 --> 06:45.614
About what?

06:45.616 --> 06:46.698
[Sighs heavily]

06:46.700 --> 06:48.600
Back when I was a trader,

06:48.602 --> 06:50.652
I had an elderly couple as clients.

06:50.654 --> 06:52.204
They couldn't come to the office,

06:52.206 --> 06:55.223
so I went to their house
with some stock transactions.

06:55.225 --> 06:56.491
Well, trading outside of the office

06:56.493 --> 06:58.694
is against SEC regulations.

06:58.696 --> 07:00.629
This guy in our office

07:00.631 --> 07:02.197
told my boss.

07:02.199 --> 07:03.832
Wow.

07:03.834 --> 07:05.867
Yeah.

07:05.869 --> 07:07.536
It's pretty competitive
in the world of trading.

07:07.538 --> 07:09.771
You use any edge you can get

07:09.773 --> 07:10.672
to get rid of the competition,

07:10.674 --> 07:13.558
and I gave him a big one.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.712
I got barred from trading and fired.

07:16.714 --> 07:18.096
It made the papers and everything.

07:20.634 --> 07:23.218
Has Warren told Buck anything?

07:24.321 --> 07:26.521
You should come clean, tell him everything.

07:26.523 --> 07:29.357
At the very least,
you'll ruin Warren's fun,

07:29.359 --> 07:31.560
but more importantly,

07:31.562 --> 07:33.345
you should get ahead of the story.

07:33.347 --> 07:37.332
Make sure that you tell
your story, not Warren.

07:41.472 --> 07:43.889
[Knock on door]

07:44.758 --> 07:46.174
Hey.

07:46.176 --> 07:48.076
[Sighing]

07:48.078 --> 07:50.962
Do you think the light's
gonna be okay at 5:00?

07:50.964 --> 07:52.380
'Cause I mean,

07:52.382 --> 07:53.982
if it's too bright, then...

07:53.984 --> 07:55.784
The town photo.

07:55.786 --> 07:56.918
I don't want a town picture

07:56.920 --> 08:00.555
full of squinters.

08:00.557 --> 08:04.643
You know, the eyes are
the windows to the soul.

08:04.645 --> 08:05.894
Your windows are all fogged up.

08:05.896 --> 08:07.362
[Chuckles]

08:08.265 --> 08:09.564
Did you talk to Jack?

08:09.566 --> 08:11.099
Not yet.

08:11.101 --> 08:12.400
Well, you have to.

08:12.402 --> 08:14.336
You have a fight, you have to make up.

08:14.338 --> 08:15.987
That's the best part,

08:15.989 --> 08:17.239
hearing them say,

08:17.241 --> 08:18.406
"I'm sorry.

08:18.408 --> 08:19.975
You were right.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.009
I'm an idiot."

08:21.011 --> 08:22.778
That was my ringtone

08:22.780 --> 08:24.212
when I was married to Dan.

08:24.214 --> 08:26.815
Not that, you know, Jack is Dan.

08:29.052 --> 08:30.585
I can move past the fact

08:30.587 --> 08:32.687
that he was drinking behind my back,

08:32.688 --> 08:35.190
and even though I don't like her,

08:35.192 --> 08:37.926
I'm over the fact he was
hanging out with Jeri.

08:37.928 --> 08:40.578
Then what is it?

08:40.581 --> 08:45.567
What if this relapse
wasn't an isolated incident?

08:45.569 --> 08:56.862
What if this is what I'm signing up for?

08:56.864 --> 08:58.630
Hi.

08:58.632 --> 09:00.382
I'm uh, Paul Watson.

09:00.384 --> 09:01.566
I called earlier, I spoke to your wife,

09:01.568 --> 09:03.018
she said you had a vacancy?

09:03.020 --> 09:04.786
It filled.

09:04.788 --> 09:06.454
In an hour?

09:06.456 --> 09:09.875
Yup. We're very popular.

09:10.794 --> 09:11.793
And friendly.

09:11.795 --> 09:12.761
[Chuckling]

09:12.763 --> 09:13.895
Yes, to most people, I am friendly.

09:13.897 --> 09:15.530
Paul?

09:15.532 --> 09:16.531
Peggy?

09:16.533 --> 09:17.549
Welcome.

09:17.551 --> 09:19.000
Thank you. Hi.

09:19.002 --> 09:19.985
I've got a great room for you,

09:19.987 --> 09:21.903
very private, very quiet, in the back.

09:21.905 --> 09:23.004
Dinner is at 7:00,

09:23.006 --> 09:24.422
so, do you have any allergies?

09:24.424 --> 09:26.591
I will eat anything you put in front of me.

09:26.593 --> 09:28.310
I love guests when they say that.

09:28.312 --> 09:29.311
Come on.

09:29.313 --> 09:30.412
Okay.

09:36.186 --> 09:37.669
This is feeling suspiciously

09:37.671 --> 09:40.155
like an excuse to give
me money and not a job,

09:40.157 --> 09:41.656
which is what my mom thought it would be,

09:41.658 --> 09:44.342
so it's doubly upsetting
that this is making her right.

09:44.344 --> 09:45.777
It is a job.

09:45.779 --> 09:46.928
I need you.

09:46.930 --> 09:48.463
I have business.

09:48.465 --> 09:50.098
All I've done so far is
drive you to this restaurant.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.868
Correction, you drove
me to a business meeting,

09:52.870 --> 09:54.002
which is what assistants do.

09:54.004 --> 09:55.403
Uncle Will...

09:55.405 --> 09:57.155
It's true!

09:57.157 --> 09:58.573
This is...

09:58.575 --> 09:59.758
Justine.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.176
Warren.

10:01.178 --> 10:02.510
Will, right?

10:02.512 --> 10:03.979
Yeah, it is.

10:03.981 --> 10:05.063
- Hey. It's been a while.
- Yeah, sit, please.

10:05.065 --> 10:06.448
Warren, we have a business meeting.

10:06.450 --> 10:08.917
Yeah, I know.

10:08.919 --> 10:09.985
You do?

10:09.987 --> 10:11.102
Mm-hmm.

10:12.105 --> 10:13.521
It's with me.

10:13.523 --> 10:16.558
Warren and I might do a
little business together.

10:24.201 --> 10:25.750
So, if the terms are
agreeable to both parties,

10:25.752 --> 10:28.503
we can move on with the
final divorce decree.

10:28.505 --> 10:29.938
Your Honor.

10:29.940 --> 10:31.539
I would like to keep the house.

10:31.541 --> 10:32.874
What?

10:32.876 --> 10:33.842
[Olivia sighs]

10:33.844 --> 10:34.809
If you can't decide

10:34.811 --> 10:36.378
on the disposition of the house,

10:36.380 --> 10:38.747
you're going to have to
pay your lawyers more money,

10:38.749 --> 10:39.781
and spend days in court

10:39.783 --> 10:42.584
fighting each other.

10:42.586 --> 10:45.203
It's costly, and it's not necessary.

10:45.205 --> 10:47.722
You've already amicably
split all other assets.

10:47.724 --> 10:49.491
It won't be costly.

10:49.493 --> 10:52.227
A trial is always expensive.

10:52.229 --> 10:53.528
I'm sure

10:53.530 --> 10:55.063
that if you two speak with your attorneys,

10:55.065 --> 10:56.498
that they will agree the
best thing for both of you...

10:56.500 --> 10:57.832
It was us.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.534
What?

10:59.536 --> 11:00.936
I'm a lawyer.

11:00.938 --> 11:02.804
So am I, Your Honor.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.386
Hi.

11:18.388 --> 11:19.921
I've been thinking.

11:19.923 --> 11:21.306
[Sighs heavily]

11:21.308 --> 11:23.742
Look, there's something that I need to say.

11:23.744 --> 11:26.428
Okay.

11:27.814 --> 11:30.699
Moving in together would be a mistake.

11:31.802 --> 11:34.035
I got ahead of myself,

11:34.037 --> 11:35.820
and, uh...

11:35.822 --> 11:37.672
We're just not ready.

11:37.674 --> 11:40.875
And maybe we won't ever be ready,

11:40.877 --> 11:42.243
and that's fine, too.

11:43.513 --> 11:45.180
I'm sorry we fought.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.481
I just was feeling cornered.

11:46.483 --> 11:48.483
Exactly.

11:48.485 --> 11:51.970
From now on, we'll just
spend time together,

11:51.972 --> 11:53.154
or not.

11:53.156 --> 11:55.223
We'll just let things unfold.

11:55.225 --> 11:57.409
No pressure.

11:59.229 --> 12:01.179
Okay?

12:01.181 --> 12:02.330
Okay.

12:02.332 --> 12:03.798
I just want to make sure

12:03.800 --> 12:06.851
that you know how sorry
I am for everything.

12:08.105 --> 12:09.504
I wish that I could undo it,

12:09.506 --> 12:11.973
but I can't.

12:17.314 --> 12:18.897
All right.

12:26.423 --> 12:27.722
[Sighs]

12:30.054 --> 12:31.453
I sure hope there's going to be enough room

12:31.455 --> 12:32.454
at the marina.

12:32.456 --> 12:35.557
I sent out so many e-mails.

12:35.559 --> 12:37.393
I'm sure you'll be able
to squeeze everyone in.

12:37.395 --> 12:38.394
You do know

12:38.396 --> 12:40.212
that the photo's being taken at sunset.

12:40.214 --> 12:41.547
John knows that, right?

12:41.549 --> 12:42.965
Because he's always late.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.883
He'll be there.

12:44.885 --> 12:47.286
So, have you given, you
know, any more thought

12:47.288 --> 12:49.838
as to what kind of menu
you're going to have?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.223
The Galley,

12:51.225 --> 12:54.109
when you and John take over.

12:54.111 --> 12:56.245
Um, Mom...

12:56.247 --> 12:59.181
Our investor backed out.

12:59.183 --> 13:01.717
So, what does that mean?

13:01.719 --> 13:04.203
We can't buy the Galley.

13:04.205 --> 13:06.488
But you're not going to leave Cedar Cove?

13:06.490 --> 13:08.223
I'm sure that's what John wants to do.

13:08.225 --> 13:08.974
Honey, no!

13:08.976 --> 13:10.409
I can talk to John.

13:10.411 --> 13:11.860
No. Don't.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.846
Please don't talk to John.

13:13.848 --> 13:16.765
We'll find another investor, really.

13:16.767 --> 13:21.003
Mom, let's not talk about this, okay?

13:21.839 --> 13:23.405
Okay.

13:24.692 --> 13:26.325
Thank you.

13:29.847 --> 13:30.546
[Brisk knock]

13:32.316 --> 13:34.883
I saw your divorcing lawyers in the hall.

13:34.885 --> 13:36.885
They seem fun.

13:36.887 --> 13:39.238
Definitely erring on the side of ugly.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.189
But no doubt you'll steer them

13:40.191 --> 13:42.257
towards a quick resolution.

13:42.259 --> 13:43.392
They don't want one.

13:43.394 --> 13:45.194
They do. They hate each other.

13:45.196 --> 13:47.062
Thin line, right?

13:47.064 --> 13:48.163
True, true,

13:48.165 --> 13:49.148
but they don't want to be together,

13:49.150 --> 13:50.966
so I just say, you know,

13:50.968 --> 13:51.934
cool down and play ball.

13:51.936 --> 13:54.670
No, she wants to hate him,

13:54.672 --> 13:56.021
which means, he hurt her.

13:56.023 --> 13:58.407
Which is why they're
getting divorced, right?

13:58.409 --> 13:59.775
It's not that simple,

13:59.777 --> 14:00.976
no divorce is.

14:00.978 --> 14:02.628
It's not about the house.

14:02.630 --> 14:03.579
Then what's it about?

14:03.581 --> 14:05.848
I don't know,

14:05.850 --> 14:07.783
but I'm going to find out.

14:07.785 --> 14:09.084
Oh...

14:09.086 --> 14:11.119
A little Sherlock under the robes, huh?

14:11.121 --> 14:13.589
Every good judge is part detective.

14:13.591 --> 14:16.091
Well, you are better than good.

14:17.928 --> 14:19.228
Um...

14:20.831 --> 14:22.981
Uh, by the way, Peggy called me.

14:22.983 --> 14:25.317
Yeah, I just got a room
at the thyme and tide.

14:25.319 --> 14:27.936
Peggy and Bob are so sweet.

14:27.938 --> 14:29.805
Peggy, yeah.

14:29.807 --> 14:32.074
Okay, Bob can be a little gruff,

14:32.076 --> 14:34.943
but underneath, he is
just a big teddy bear.

14:34.945 --> 14:36.445
Yeah, he seems like such a nice guy,

14:36.447 --> 14:37.513
who wants me to leave.

14:37.515 --> 14:38.814
The Thyme & Tide?

14:38.816 --> 14:40.816
No, Cedar Cove, I think.

14:40.818 --> 14:41.817
I don't know, he spent a lot of time

14:41.819 --> 14:42.751
talking about you.

14:42.753 --> 14:43.752
Me?

14:43.754 --> 14:45.687
Yeah. And Jack.

14:45.689 --> 14:47.189
Oh.

14:48.993 --> 14:50.893
We're, um... we're taking a break,

14:50.895 --> 14:54.997
or, uh, stepping back...

14:54.999 --> 14:57.249
Actually, I'm not sure what we're doing.

14:57.251 --> 14:58.917
We were talking about moving in together,

14:58.919 --> 15:00.536
and now we're not.

15:00.538 --> 15:02.154
It's complicated.

15:02.156 --> 15:04.273
All relationships are.

15:04.275 --> 15:08.377
I would literally pay
you to change the subject.

15:08.379 --> 15:09.778
I'll do it for free.

15:09.780 --> 15:10.729
[Gasps dramatically]

15:10.731 --> 15:12.047
Want to talk about arson?

15:12.049 --> 15:13.015
[Laughs]

15:13.017 --> 15:14.616
So much so.

15:14.618 --> 15:15.751
[Laughing]

15:15.753 --> 15:17.853
Well...

15:17.855 --> 15:20.022
Voilà.

15:20.024 --> 15:21.456
What do you think?

15:21.458 --> 15:23.125
When we met the other day,

15:23.127 --> 15:24.743
I told you that I wanted
to buy a house to flip,

15:24.745 --> 15:26.528
like an investment property.

15:26.530 --> 15:27.629
No, I understand that, Will,

15:27.631 --> 15:29.214
but I don't do that kind of real estate.

15:29.216 --> 15:30.432
I'm a developer.

15:30.434 --> 15:32.634
It's more money to be made all around.

15:32.636 --> 15:33.952
[Sighs] I don't know.

15:33.954 --> 15:35.337
Okay, come on, look,
if you can flip a house,

15:35.339 --> 15:37.172
you can develop a piece of land.

15:37.174 --> 15:38.607
I had a friend of mine on the county board

15:38.609 --> 15:40.175
who tells me this property right here

15:40.177 --> 15:42.544
is being zoned for multi-units.

15:42.546 --> 15:45.280
So, how much are we talking about?

15:45.282 --> 15:46.882
Gotta spend money to make money, my friend.

15:47.718 --> 15:50.285
[Inhales] Hmm.

15:50.287 --> 15:52.154
I'll give my business manager a call.

15:52.156 --> 15:54.172
[Chuckling] Okay.

15:55.225 --> 15:57.092
[Sighing with satisfaction]

15:57.094 --> 15:58.660
So...

15:58.662 --> 16:01.630
I, uh, heard you dumped Seth.

16:01.632 --> 16:02.998
No, I dumped you.

16:03.000 --> 16:03.966
Seth and I broke up.

16:03.968 --> 16:05.083
Right.

16:05.085 --> 16:07.269
Well, it's nice to see
you change your careers

16:07.271 --> 16:08.520
as often as you change your men.

16:08.522 --> 16:10.172
It's consistent, but it's sporadic,

16:10.174 --> 16:11.173
which is hard to achieve,

16:11.175 --> 16:12.341
but kudos to you.

16:12.343 --> 16:13.642
Didn't change some of them fast enough.

16:13.644 --> 16:16.361
[Chuckles]

16:19.016 --> 16:21.149
Well, looking forward to working with you.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.251
You're working with my uncle, not with me.

16:23.253 --> 16:24.970
You know, you're right.

16:24.972 --> 16:26.788
You are working <i> for</i> him,

16:26.790 --> 16:28.740
and he's working <i> with</i> me,

16:28.742 --> 16:31.727
so you see how that's a
nice happy coincidence?

16:32.629 --> 16:33.395
William!

16:33.697 --> 16:35.797
[Will]: ... Okay, good,
talk to you soon. Bye.

16:47.094 --> 16:49.728
I really appreciate you
meeting with me, Peggy.

16:49.730 --> 16:51.580
I didn't know who else to call.

16:51.582 --> 16:53.465
Of course.

16:55.319 --> 16:56.385
I want to tell you something,

16:56.387 --> 16:57.369
but I'm afraid

16:57.371 --> 17:00.188
it'll change the way you feel about me,

17:00.190 --> 17:02.624
about Corrie and me.

17:02.626 --> 17:05.310
Roy, I love you both,

17:05.311 --> 17:06.944
so that's never gonna change.

17:06.946 --> 17:09.263
And I know,

17:09.266 --> 17:11.833
whatever it is, it's been
eating at Corrie, too,

17:11.835 --> 17:14.368
so anything I can do to help, I'm here.

17:16.339 --> 17:17.990
You know most of this, I'm sure,

17:17.992 --> 17:20.541
but, um, Corrie and I broke up for a while

17:20.544 --> 17:21.643
while we were young.

17:21.645 --> 17:24.029
Yeah, I remember.

17:24.031 --> 17:27.848
I didn't know it at the
time, but she was pregnant.

17:28.986 --> 17:30.585
And she put the baby...

17:30.587 --> 17:32.337
our baby...

17:32.339 --> 17:33.989
up for adoption.

17:33.991 --> 17:37.459
I didn't know about it until years later

17:37.461 --> 17:38.727
until it was, uh,

17:38.729 --> 17:39.828
it was too late.

17:41.331 --> 17:45.267
Well, you can't blame Corrie for that.

17:45.269 --> 17:47.269
She was doing what she thought was right

17:47.271 --> 17:48.904
at the time.

17:48.906 --> 17:52.040
I'm not blaming anybody, I just...

17:52.042 --> 17:55.844
I just want to try and make
things right, that's all.

17:55.846 --> 17:57.746
But Corrie won't let me.

18:00.117 --> 18:01.366
[Sighs]

18:02.986 --> 18:04.803
Let me see what I can do.

18:06.023 --> 18:09.658
Thanks.

18:13.697 --> 18:14.663
Packing up?

18:14.665 --> 18:16.548
Warren.

18:16.550 --> 18:18.233
Hey, Dad.

18:18.235 --> 18:20.402
Listen, I got a little surprise for you.

18:20.404 --> 18:21.470
Does this surprise have anything to do

18:21.472 --> 18:23.338
with Alex losing her broker's license

18:23.340 --> 18:24.573
and getting fired?

18:24.575 --> 18:26.108
Or do you have some other surprise for me?

18:30.114 --> 18:31.613
She told you?

18:31.615 --> 18:32.464
I knew before I hired her.

18:32.466 --> 18:33.799
It's called due diligence.

18:33.801 --> 18:36.785
And you still want her here?

18:36.787 --> 18:38.620
Hasn't stopped you from working here.

18:38.622 --> 18:40.505
Look, your childish attitude toward Alex

18:40.507 --> 18:41.656
is hurting this company.

18:41.658 --> 18:42.624
My company.

18:42.626 --> 18:43.708
Something's gotta give, son.

18:46.997 --> 18:49.531
Or maybe someone's gotta go.

18:49.603 --> 18:51.670
That is definitely an option,

18:51.672 --> 18:52.971
but it's not gonna be Alex.

18:54.488 --> 18:56.154
Okay. Fine.

18:56.156 --> 18:57.756
I quit.

18:58.659 --> 18:59.591
I know this town,

18:59.593 --> 19:00.825
and you don't.

19:00.827 --> 19:01.826
And I'm going to go out there,

19:01.828 --> 19:03.428
I'm gonna start my own business,

19:03.430 --> 19:04.796
and when I do, I'm going
to do everything in my power

19:04.798 --> 19:06.564
to drive the you both
right out of Cedar Cove.

19:06.566 --> 19:08.166
You understand me?

19:09.186 --> 19:10.185
Dad.

19:10.187 --> 19:12.170
- Alex?
- Yes?

19:12.172 --> 19:13.622
Have the locks changed.

19:23.767 --> 19:24.749
Hey.

19:24.751 --> 19:25.817
Hey.

19:31.858 --> 19:33.275
Wow...

19:33.277 --> 19:35.577
Smell of bait is a real turn-on, is it?

19:35.579 --> 19:36.594
[Chuckles]

19:36.596 --> 19:38.046
I just missed you.

19:38.048 --> 19:39.864
I'm not complaining.

19:39.866 --> 19:43.134
How was your first day with your uncle?

19:43.136 --> 19:44.719
Uneasy.

19:44.721 --> 19:46.604
Well, let me see if I can make it better.

20:01.321 --> 20:02.737
I've been stood up.

20:02.739 --> 20:06.007
By an entire town.

20:14.543 --> 20:16.642
- Where were you?
- [Olivia]: When?

20:16.744 --> 20:19.745
Yesterday? The town photo?

20:19.747 --> 20:20.813
I'm sorry, I had court.

20:20.815 --> 20:22.181
I sent you an e-mail.

20:22.183 --> 20:23.182
I couldn't have been missed,

20:23.184 --> 20:25.017
I'm only one person.

20:25.019 --> 20:27.102
Only a handful of people showed up.

20:27.104 --> 20:29.471
Everybody I know had
some kind of an excuse,

20:29.473 --> 20:32.491
and the ones I don't know
didn't show up either.

20:32.493 --> 20:33.859
It was supposed to be so simple.

20:33.861 --> 20:35.260
I'm sorry.

20:35.262 --> 20:36.395
Well, fortunately for you

20:36.397 --> 20:37.329
and our friendship,

20:37.331 --> 20:39.231
I'm rescheduling.

20:39.233 --> 20:40.232
I'll be there.

20:40.234 --> 20:41.800
I promise.

20:41.802 --> 20:43.769
Well, you seem better,

20:43.771 --> 20:46.538
not great, but better.

20:46.540 --> 20:48.340
- What's going on?
- With Jack?

20:48.342 --> 20:49.942
No, the economy.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.844
Yes, Jack.

20:51.846 --> 20:55.297
He said that we should, um...

20:55.299 --> 20:56.548
"Hang out,"

20:56.550 --> 20:59.751
and take the pressure off of both of us.

20:59.753 --> 21:01.453
Well, that's good. It
sounds like he's trying.

21:03.090 --> 21:04.490
You did say you wanted him to back off.

21:04.492 --> 21:07.292
Yeah, back off living together,

21:07.294 --> 21:09.228
not back off in general.

21:09.230 --> 21:10.529
Hmm.

21:10.531 --> 21:16.268
Might be a little too nuanced for a guy.

21:16.270 --> 21:18.220
So, I've been thinking,

21:18.222 --> 21:19.972
and talking to Peggy.

21:19.974 --> 21:24.076
I think that we should send
our information to the agency,

21:24.078 --> 21:26.211
and if she still wants to meet with us,

21:26.213 --> 21:29.631
then we'll just take it from there.

21:29.633 --> 21:31.116
[Chuckles]

21:31.118 --> 21:33.519
Why are you laughing?

21:33.521 --> 21:35.454
I'm just relieved, I guess.

21:35.456 --> 21:38.490
I sent it in a few days ago.

21:38.492 --> 21:40.726
I knew you'd come around.

21:40.728 --> 21:42.494
I hoped you would.

21:42.496 --> 21:43.462
Really?

21:43.464 --> 21:44.663
Mm-hmm.

21:44.665 --> 21:46.365
I know you pretty well,

21:46.367 --> 21:49.635
and I knew this is what you wanted.

21:49.637 --> 21:54.439
You want to meet your daughter.

21:56.343 --> 21:58.544
I'm scared.

21:58.546 --> 22:02.047
Just like everything else,

22:02.049 --> 22:04.049
we're in it together.

22:04.051 --> 22:06.268
Don't forget that.

22:11.846 --> 22:13.328
Hey, Bob, I'm glad you're here,

22:13.330 --> 22:15.114
because I need you.

22:15.116 --> 22:15.914
We need risers.

22:15.916 --> 22:16.882
No, you don't.

22:16.884 --> 22:17.850
Oh, yes, we do,

22:17.852 --> 22:18.851
because we need to make sure

22:18.853 --> 22:19.985
everybody gets seen.

22:19.987 --> 22:22.871
Mm-hmm, and they won't be seen.

22:23.757 --> 22:25.257
That e-mail blast of yours,

22:25.259 --> 22:27.693
somebody reported you to the county,

22:27.695 --> 22:29.528
the county sent out their own blast,

22:29.530 --> 22:31.346
putting the kibosh on the whole thing.

22:31.348 --> 22:32.781
That's why no one showed.

22:32.783 --> 22:34.583
But why would somebody do that?

22:34.585 --> 22:36.435
Well, officially, an event this large,

22:36.437 --> 22:38.437
you need a permit.

22:38.439 --> 22:39.571
You didn't tell me we needed a permit...

22:39.573 --> 22:40.989
you didn't tell me

22:40.991 --> 22:42.291
you were going to do
this before you did it.

22:42.293 --> 22:43.542
I thought you might get away with it.

22:43.544 --> 22:44.810
Okay, fine, you know what we're gonna do,

22:44.812 --> 22:45.944
we will go out and get this permit

22:45.946 --> 22:48.247
and we will reschedule.

22:48.249 --> 22:49.748
All right, when do you want to do that,

22:49.750 --> 22:51.934
next summer or next fall?

22:52.953 --> 22:54.586
They've issued all the permits

22:54.588 --> 22:56.522
for this summer already.

22:56.524 --> 22:58.524
So, no picture.

22:58.526 --> 22:59.992
No.

22:59.994 --> 23:02.161
No Seattle Living AM?

23:02.163 --> 23:03.512
No.

23:03.514 --> 23:04.863
Then I failed, Bob!

23:04.865 --> 23:05.864
No...

23:05.866 --> 23:07.299
Yes, I did.

23:07.301 --> 23:08.851
It was my first big test as town manager,

23:08.853 --> 23:10.302
and I just failed!

23:10.304 --> 23:11.436
Grace...

23:11.438 --> 23:14.006
You didn't lead us into war.

23:14.008 --> 23:14.957
Settle down.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.842
This will all work out.

23:16.844 --> 23:17.559
No, it won't.

23:17.561 --> 23:19.194
I really don't think so.

23:19.196 --> 23:21.180
Is it too late to get Norman back?

23:22.116 --> 23:23.232
Yes.

23:31.258 --> 23:32.407
[Knocks]

23:33.460 --> 23:35.310
Okay, it's officially a record.

23:35.312 --> 23:37.729
I have never seen this
many witnesses being called

23:37.731 --> 23:39.031
for a divorce case.

23:39.033 --> 23:40.332
Their banker?

23:40.334 --> 23:43.068
To testify who made the down payment.

23:43.070 --> 23:44.269
Oh, of course.

23:44.271 --> 23:45.704
Their realtor?

23:45.706 --> 23:47.723
To testify who found the house.

23:47.725 --> 23:49.191
I should have got that one.

23:49.193 --> 23:50.842
Their gardener and housekeepers.

23:50.844 --> 23:52.878
To prove who took care of the house.

23:52.880 --> 23:55.047
Want to go to final jeopardy
where the score really adds up?

23:55.049 --> 23:56.615
No. No, I don't.

23:56.617 --> 23:58.317
They have filed motion on top of motion.

23:58.319 --> 24:00.352
[Scoffs] Lawyers.

24:00.354 --> 24:01.553
I am serious!

24:01.555 --> 24:04.156
It's an abuse of court.

24:04.158 --> 24:05.791
Well, you can block all extraneous motions.

24:05.793 --> 24:07.426
I thought about that,

24:07.428 --> 24:11.663
but then I realized
there's something missing.

24:11.665 --> 24:13.098
A motion?

24:13.100 --> 24:14.299
A witness.

24:14.301 --> 24:16.368
Nice job, Sherlock.

24:20.474 --> 24:22.107
This was left for you at the front.

24:22.109 --> 24:24.042
Oh, you order in?

24:24.044 --> 24:27.112
No, I didn't.

24:27.114 --> 24:29.081
Oh. What is it?

24:29.083 --> 24:33.051
Ah, it's beef and broccoli.

24:34.705 --> 24:36.488
There's no beef.

24:36.490 --> 24:38.774
Jack eats the beef,

24:38.776 --> 24:40.559
I eat the broccoli.

24:41.562 --> 24:44.763
If Jack's here, why didn't he come in?

24:44.765 --> 24:47.966
He's giving me space.

24:51.171 --> 24:52.671
Good times?

24:52.673 --> 24:55.407
A lot of them.

24:55.409 --> 24:57.442
Well then, there's a lot to save.

24:57.444 --> 25:01.146
Yes. There is.

25:03.984 --> 25:04.983
[Laughs]

25:04.985 --> 25:07.886
All dressed up and nowhere to go.

25:07.888 --> 25:09.805
Buck told me.

25:09.807 --> 25:11.490
Buck told you?

25:11.492 --> 25:12.608
Yeah, at breakfast.

25:12.610 --> 25:13.992
You had breakfast with my father?

25:13.994 --> 25:16.395
Just about every day, yeah.

25:16.397 --> 25:18.096
He is good people.

25:18.098 --> 25:20.132
Okay, Moon, look,

25:20.134 --> 25:20.999
I'm good person, too, you know.

25:21.001 --> 25:22.618
[Chuckles ruefully] Not so good.

25:22.620 --> 25:24.086
Actually, uh,

25:24.088 --> 25:25.137
not good at all.

25:25.139 --> 25:26.104
Okay, you know what, enough.

25:26.106 --> 25:27.572
You know, I'm done with Saget,

25:27.574 --> 25:28.824
done with my father.

25:28.826 --> 25:31.343
I am going out on my own, Moon,

25:31.345 --> 25:32.644
and I've got big plans.

25:32.646 --> 25:35.247
Well, I hope your plans
take you really far, Warren.

25:35.249 --> 25:36.281
Seriously.

25:36.283 --> 25:38.917
Far... far away.

25:38.919 --> 25:42.504
Like maybe a state or two away.

25:42.506 --> 25:44.389
I wouldn't give my father the satisfaction.

25:44.391 --> 25:45.774
[Chuckles]

25:45.776 --> 25:47.576
This has all the makings
of a Greek tragedy.

25:47.578 --> 25:50.195
You and your father,

25:50.197 --> 25:51.763
reason why I don't need cable.

25:56.270 --> 25:58.887
Okay, Grace, I'll call you later.

25:58.889 --> 26:00.172
Aw, Grace is pretty upset

26:00.174 --> 26:02.240
about not being able to do this town photo.

26:02.242 --> 26:03.542
I just feel horrible.

26:03.544 --> 26:04.843
Well, it's not your fault.

26:04.845 --> 26:06.728
I didn't ask if she had a permit,

26:06.730 --> 26:08.246
I just assumed she did.

26:08.248 --> 26:10.849
I just don't think it's going to happen.

26:10.851 --> 26:12.517
There's not much you can do.

26:12.519 --> 26:13.635
I could call the county clerk,

26:13.637 --> 26:15.737
but they're pretty strict.

26:16.573 --> 26:17.956
Why don't we go for a drink?

26:17.958 --> 26:19.758
Take your mind off of it.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.143
You can talk about anyone, anything...

26:21.145 --> 26:22.594
Grace, Jack...

26:22.596 --> 26:23.695
it won't go any further.

26:23.697 --> 26:24.696
Attorney-client privilege.

26:24.698 --> 26:26.965
You're not my attorney.

26:26.967 --> 26:27.966
Give me a dollar.

26:27.968 --> 26:29.217
You want me to give you a dollar?

26:29.219 --> 26:30.535
I want you to give me a dollar.

26:39.179 --> 26:40.128
There.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.513
You have now secured my legal services.

26:41.515 --> 26:44.983
Now anything you say cannot be divulged.

26:44.985 --> 26:47.085
Well, what if I don't want to talk?

26:47.087 --> 26:51.056
I do some of my best work in silence.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.226
Okay, one... one drink.

26:54.228 --> 26:56.461
One drink.

27:07.111 --> 27:08.377
So, this seems like a good fit.

27:08.379 --> 27:10.680
You need the cash, I need a tax shelter.

27:10.682 --> 27:11.681
Yeah.

27:11.683 --> 27:13.366
We need to talk to the bank.

27:13.368 --> 27:15.067
I could finance the whole thing.

27:15.069 --> 27:16.419
Cut the bank right out of it,

27:16.421 --> 27:17.720
save the fees.

27:17.722 --> 27:19.355
That'd be great.

27:19.357 --> 27:20.523
Of course, I would need

27:20.525 --> 27:21.824
a bigger percentage of the profits.

27:21.826 --> 27:23.843
Control of the books.

27:23.845 --> 27:25.795
I'd need to bring a
few of my key people in,

27:25.797 --> 27:28.097
you know, to protect my investment.

27:28.099 --> 27:29.448
Yeah.

27:29.450 --> 27:32.001
Maryellen?

27:32.003 --> 27:34.003
Oh, I think, um...

27:34.005 --> 27:36.205
John and I need to talk.

27:36.207 --> 27:37.506
Alone.

27:37.508 --> 27:38.474
Yeah.

27:38.476 --> 27:40.059
I'll be in touch.

27:41.479 --> 27:43.079
Bye.

27:48.286 --> 27:50.820
[♪♪]

27:57.795 --> 28:00.463
Jack, I know what's going on with you two.

28:00.465 --> 28:02.665
I'm concerned about Mom.

28:04.485 --> 28:07.169
Justine, she is one of the
strongest people I know.

28:07.171 --> 28:09.605
She's tough, but she's not, you know?

28:09.607 --> 28:11.157
She needs you to fight for her.

28:12.076 --> 28:13.075
[Sighs]

28:13.077 --> 28:14.343
Sometimes even strong people

28:14.345 --> 28:15.411
need a push in the right direction.

28:15.413 --> 28:17.880
Well, you know, I tried pushing,

28:17.882 --> 28:19.181
and that backfired on me.

28:19.183 --> 28:20.416
She loves you.

28:20.418 --> 28:22.785
She misses you, I can tell.

28:22.787 --> 28:24.186
If you want her in your life,

28:24.188 --> 28:26.088
I'm telling you, you need to fight for her,

28:26.090 --> 28:27.673
and you need to do it now.

28:30.695 --> 28:33.596
You've been busy.

28:33.598 --> 28:35.765
You've ruined my credit,

28:35.767 --> 28:39.418
managed to bad-mouth me to
any possible new partners,

28:39.420 --> 28:41.270
which has made it virtually impossible

28:41.272 --> 28:42.705
for me to start over.

28:42.707 --> 28:43.656
Mm-hmm.

28:43.658 --> 28:45.407
Are you ready to come back?

28:46.511 --> 28:47.810
I don't like her.

28:47.812 --> 28:51.213
Nah, you just haven't
figured out how to play her.

28:51.215 --> 28:52.681
There's a difference.

28:52.683 --> 28:56.051
Alex is a part of this company.

28:56.053 --> 28:59.054
Dad, I really don't
think I can work with her.

29:03.511 --> 29:06.378
Your new company credit card.

29:08.299 --> 29:09.899
It's all yours,

29:09.901 --> 29:12.284
if you promise to play nice.

29:20.077 --> 29:22.812
Your Honor, may I ask
what this meeting's about?

29:22.814 --> 29:24.480
I couldn't help but notice

29:24.482 --> 29:26.982
that you had everyone on your witness list

29:26.984 --> 29:28.551
except your contractor.

29:28.553 --> 29:30.519
You listed your housekeeper,

29:30.521 --> 29:32.288
but not the person

29:32.290 --> 29:35.391
who did major renovations on your home,

29:35.393 --> 29:38.427
and I found that a little odd.

29:38.429 --> 29:40.579
Well, neither of us felt it was important.

29:40.581 --> 29:43.933
Did you have a relationship
with Jennifer Carter,

29:43.935 --> 29:45.701
your contractor?

29:47.238 --> 29:49.338
He had an affair.

29:52.109 --> 29:54.076
One bad decision.

29:54.078 --> 29:55.711
It was one act, one night.

29:55.713 --> 29:57.263
I regretted it then, and I regret it now,

29:57.265 --> 30:01.634
but she just can't let
it go and move forward.

30:01.636 --> 30:03.552
We tried couples' therapy.

30:03.554 --> 30:06.071
We tried relationship retreats.

30:06.073 --> 30:08.624
If you two really wanted a divorce,

30:08.626 --> 30:10.025
you would already be divorced,

30:10.027 --> 30:12.661
instead of using this
house to stay connected.

30:12.663 --> 30:14.563
And clog up my docket.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.465
Go back to therapy.

30:16.467 --> 30:17.933
You may surprise yourself.

30:20.371 --> 30:23.105
Or I could hold you both in contempt,

30:23.107 --> 30:24.974
lock you in a cell together

30:24.976 --> 30:26.475
until you start acting like adults.

30:26.477 --> 30:29.411
And I can, you know.

30:30.581 --> 30:31.614
[Bangs gavel]

30:31.616 --> 30:33.449
Bye-bye.

30:42.827 --> 30:45.828
I don't feel comfortable with Jimmy.

30:45.830 --> 30:48.731
I'm sorry, I say no to
borrowing money from him.

30:48.733 --> 30:50.065
I agree.

30:50.067 --> 30:52.001
Yeah?

30:52.003 --> 30:53.052
I don't want to get into business

30:53.054 --> 30:54.486
with any more shady people.

30:54.488 --> 30:55.821
Then why would you?

30:55.823 --> 30:57.539
To make you happy.

30:57.541 --> 30:58.674
Us. Us happy.

30:58.676 --> 31:00.859
I'm happy in New York.

31:00.861 --> 31:03.245
You aren't. I get it.

31:03.247 --> 31:05.881
What I love, you don't.

31:05.883 --> 31:07.283
My life isn't here.

31:07.285 --> 31:08.651
"My? My?"

31:08.723 --> 31:10.456
What about "us", huh?

31:10.458 --> 31:11.557
What about me?

31:13.294 --> 31:15.227
It's not just about you, it's about us.

31:15.229 --> 31:16.662
It's always been about us.

31:16.664 --> 31:19.631
No, not since we moved away.

31:34.782 --> 31:38.133
[Scoffs] Motorcycle.

31:38.135 --> 31:40.102
What are you talking about?

31:40.104 --> 31:42.838
There's always one guy
who thinks he's all that,

31:42.840 --> 31:44.006
and that guy?

31:44.008 --> 31:45.124
Is that guy.

31:52.466 --> 31:53.465
Hey.

31:53.467 --> 31:54.466
Hey!

31:54.468 --> 31:55.684
Um, I've decided to stay on.

31:55.686 --> 31:56.819
Really?

31:56.821 --> 31:58.668
Yeah, on a month-to-month,
basis, if that's okay?

31:58.669 --> 31:59.671
Yes. Great.

31:59.673 --> 32:01.673
Great! Uh, dinner, 7:00? Kitchen?

32:01.675 --> 32:02.474
Mm-hmm.

32:02.676 --> 32:04.376
You can always eat in your room.

32:04.378 --> 32:06.278
And miss your company? Never.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.747
I'm making scones for breakfast.

32:08.749 --> 32:10.682
Will you take some to
the courthouse for Olivia?

32:10.684 --> 32:12.451
Absolutely. I love your scones.

32:12.453 --> 32:13.502
Aw.

32:13.504 --> 32:15.254
And I love those clogs.

32:15.256 --> 32:19.625
It takes a big man to wear that shade.

32:25.649 --> 32:28.250
If you keep feeding him, he'll never leave.

32:28.252 --> 32:30.969
Bob...

32:30.971 --> 32:32.321
I have to go hammer something.

32:32.323 --> 32:34.906
I want a new pair of gardening shoes.

32:34.908 --> 32:36.041
Black.

32:38.846 --> 32:41.913
Mom, I don't want to go back to New York.

32:41.915 --> 32:44.149
This is my home.

32:44.151 --> 32:46.151
I've missed it.

32:46.153 --> 32:47.102
I've missed you.

32:47.304 --> 32:48.620
Aw, sweetie.

32:48.622 --> 32:50.388
I've missed you, too.

32:52.993 --> 32:54.643
But for what it's worth,

32:54.645 --> 32:58.663
I have learned some things over the years.

32:58.665 --> 32:59.848
One person,

32:59.850 --> 33:02.567
you never have to compromise.

33:02.569 --> 33:04.703
Two people, you have to compromise.

33:04.705 --> 33:06.438
It's just math.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.839
But if you're in the right relationship,

33:07.841 --> 33:11.343
a compromise never feels like a compromise.

33:12.212 --> 33:13.678
[Chuckles fondly]

33:13.680 --> 33:16.515
Thanks, Mom.

33:17.351 --> 33:18.433
Hey there.

33:19.686 --> 33:22.070
What can I get you for?

33:22.072 --> 33:23.622
I'd love an iced tea.

33:25.092 --> 33:27.492
How much do I owe you?

33:27.494 --> 33:32.013
[Stammering] Actually,
uh, it's on the house.

33:32.015 --> 33:34.983
Just a little courtesy we extend
to our men and women in blue.

33:37.170 --> 33:38.904
Well, that's kind of you.

33:38.906 --> 33:41.022
So, uh...

33:41.024 --> 33:44.009
You here on...

33:44.011 --> 33:46.011
Business or for pleasure?

33:46.013 --> 33:47.779
I just moved here.

33:47.781 --> 33:48.780
Oh, you have family here.

33:48.782 --> 33:50.849
No, I don't know anybody.

33:50.851 --> 33:51.750
I decided to give

33:51.752 --> 33:53.618
small town life a try.

33:53.620 --> 33:56.788
Oh, well, you have chosen
the best small town there is.

33:56.790 --> 33:58.223
Welcome, uh... ?

33:58.225 --> 33:59.691
- Gloria.
- Gloria.

33:59.693 --> 34:00.825
Nice to meet you.

34:00.827 --> 34:01.910
I'm Moon.

34:03.564 --> 34:06.364
I'll get your tea.

34:22.149 --> 34:23.315
Bob!

34:23.317 --> 34:24.315
I'm here.

34:24.318 --> 34:25.533
What do you want to talk to me about?

34:25.534 --> 34:27.918
Well, actually, uh, it's about Peggy.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.254
She feels pretty bad

34:29.255 --> 34:30.121
about this whole town photo thing.

34:30.123 --> 34:32.023
No, it's my fault.

34:32.025 --> 34:34.359
It was just too big a
project to start with.

34:34.360 --> 34:37.045
Yeah, I wouldn't quite say that.

34:42.101 --> 34:44.703
[Gasping in delight]

34:44.705 --> 34:46.170
[Laughs]

34:47.007 --> 34:51.275
[♪♪]

34:52.696 --> 34:55.714
Bob, how did you make this happen?

34:55.716 --> 34:58.517
Well, a little bird named Olivia

34:58.519 --> 34:59.518
let me in on a loophole.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.570
You only need a permit

35:01.572 --> 35:03.372
for organized activities.

35:03.374 --> 35:05.540
Nothing says that the
town can't get together,

35:05.542 --> 35:06.591
at the same time,

35:06.593 --> 35:11.363
and if someone happens to take a picture,

35:11.365 --> 35:12.814
well, you don't need a permit

35:12.816 --> 35:13.732
for a spontaneous moment captured on film.

35:13.734 --> 35:14.983
[Laughs]

35:14.985 --> 35:17.669
But you got everyone to show up.

35:17.671 --> 35:18.754
Peggy activated

35:18.756 --> 35:19.688
the community phone tree.

35:19.690 --> 35:21.423
We have a phone tree?

35:21.425 --> 35:22.841
We do now.

35:22.843 --> 35:25.160
She got everybody in
town to call each other.

35:25.162 --> 35:26.745
Low-tech beats high-tech.

35:26.747 --> 35:28.246
[Chuckling]

35:33.520 --> 35:35.303
So...

35:35.305 --> 35:37.406
Guess I'll just leave quietly, right?

35:37.408 --> 35:40.041
Make sure you lock up.

35:40.043 --> 35:41.960
Alex and I are going
over for the town picture.

35:41.962 --> 35:43.378
You're kidding me, right?

35:43.380 --> 35:45.097
When have you ever been into
that cornball mayberry stuff?

35:45.099 --> 35:46.515
In a town like this,

35:46.517 --> 35:49.401
an event like that is
public relations gold.

35:51.205 --> 35:52.287
I tell you what,

35:52.289 --> 35:54.055
if I see you at the town photo,

35:54.057 --> 35:56.174
I'll accept it as an apology,

35:56.176 --> 35:58.393
and then I'll see you
bright and early tomorrow,

35:58.395 --> 36:00.228
here.

36:01.198 --> 36:02.380
That's as easy as I'm going to make it

36:02.382 --> 36:03.932
for you to come back, kid.

36:03.934 --> 36:07.502
Consider it an early birthday present.

36:18.525 --> 36:19.924
[Battery whining]

36:24.681 --> 36:25.730
I hate this.

36:25.732 --> 36:27.615
I know. Me too.

36:27.617 --> 36:29.701
I should go back with you.

36:29.703 --> 36:30.735
No.

36:30.737 --> 36:31.736
No, I get it,

36:31.738 --> 36:33.121
you don't like New York.

36:33.123 --> 36:34.372
I'm going to go back,

36:34.374 --> 36:36.174
and I'll get us an investor.

36:36.176 --> 36:37.559
I can do that.

36:37.561 --> 36:38.576
You believe me, right?

36:38.578 --> 36:40.445
I do.

36:40.447 --> 36:42.413
My leaving is just temporary.

36:42.415 --> 36:43.665
I know.

36:43.667 --> 36:46.417
You belong here, I belong with you,

36:46.419 --> 36:48.970
it's just going to take
some time to set that up.

36:48.972 --> 36:50.922
You'll wait?

36:52.159 --> 36:53.291
I will.

36:53.293 --> 36:54.242
I love you.

36:54.244 --> 36:56.044
I love you, too.

36:59.599 --> 37:01.649
Now, let's get you in your best light.

37:03.103 --> 37:04.619
[Chuckling and muttering]

37:04.621 --> 37:07.238
It's called the Jerry Garcia look.

37:07.240 --> 37:10.492
Hey, Moon.

37:10.494 --> 37:11.543
I don't believe it.

37:11.545 --> 37:14.379
What?

37:15.899 --> 37:18.016
So...

37:18.018 --> 37:19.267
You decided to come.

37:19.269 --> 37:23.505
Well, how could I miss a family photo, Dad?

37:23.507 --> 37:25.256
I'm going back east for a week or two.

37:25.258 --> 37:26.875
So, this will be a test run

37:26.877 --> 37:28.927
to see if things go smoothly

37:28.929 --> 37:29.928
while I'm out of the office.

37:29.930 --> 37:31.095
We'll get along just fine, don't worry.

37:31.097 --> 37:32.263
Card, please.

37:34.784 --> 37:36.701
Great, now things can get
back to normal around here...

37:36.703 --> 37:37.952
I'm putting Alex in charge.

37:37.954 --> 37:40.672
First rule of business, nothing is free.

37:40.674 --> 37:42.006
Yeah, Dad, that sounds like

37:42.008 --> 37:43.007
the first rule of being your son.

37:43.009 --> 37:44.342
[Chuckles]

37:51.334 --> 37:52.467
Justine...

37:53.970 --> 37:55.086
Who's that?

37:55.088 --> 37:56.387
Warren Saget.

37:56.389 --> 37:57.672
Oh, how do you know him?

37:57.674 --> 37:59.173
Saget Developments?

37:59.175 --> 38:00.275
Oh, is that the guy your uncle Will's

38:00.277 --> 38:01.859
going to be going into business with?

38:01.861 --> 38:04.445
Warren and Will?

38:04.447 --> 38:06.965
Cliff?

38:06.967 --> 38:08.883
I thought you were at the auction.

38:08.885 --> 38:10.301
I drove all night.

38:10.303 --> 38:11.436
Aw...

38:12.939 --> 38:14.105
I couldn't miss your first official act

38:14.107 --> 38:15.189
as town manager.

38:15.191 --> 38:16.741
Hi.

38:16.743 --> 38:18.793
Hey.

38:18.795 --> 38:21.996
Oh, boy, here comes trouble.

38:21.998 --> 38:23.498
Hi, Bob!

38:23.500 --> 38:24.716
Paul.

38:24.718 --> 38:26.234
What do you say we

38:26.236 --> 38:28.770
move you over here, away from Olivia?

38:28.772 --> 38:29.737
For balance, huh?

38:29.739 --> 38:30.872
Great.

38:34.794 --> 38:35.793
Hi.

38:35.795 --> 38:37.712
Hey there.

38:37.714 --> 38:39.047
Can we talk for a moment?

38:39.049 --> 38:41.182
It's important.

38:42.552 --> 38:43.718
All right.

38:47.657 --> 38:50.191
Look, um...

38:50.193 --> 38:52.894
There are a million reasons
why we shouldn't be together.

38:52.896 --> 38:55.830
My struggle with sobriety is...

38:55.832 --> 38:58.216
not something that's going away.

38:58.218 --> 38:59.667
It's something I'm going
to have to live with

38:59.669 --> 39:01.469
for the rest of my life.

39:01.471 --> 39:05.940
And if we end up together
the way that I want us to,

39:05.942 --> 39:07.475
it's something you're going
to have to live with, too.

39:07.477 --> 39:09.527
I know.

39:09.529 --> 39:10.895
But...

39:10.897 --> 39:13.147
I think we...

39:13.149 --> 39:14.482
We need to go back

39:14.484 --> 39:16.617
before we go forward,

39:16.619 --> 39:17.652
and it's not just what happened recently

39:17.654 --> 39:18.903
that makes me feel that way.

39:20.573 --> 39:22.990
I don't understand.

39:22.992 --> 39:25.376
We got together so fast.

39:26.996 --> 39:29.047
Well, love at first sight, right?

39:29.049 --> 39:30.832
Yes, I know,

39:30.834 --> 39:33.835
but love has never been our problem.

39:35.004 --> 39:36.838
Hmm, so, what is?

39:38.558 --> 39:41.476
We need more than love to fall back on.

39:41.478 --> 39:42.643
We do?

39:42.645 --> 39:43.845
Yes.

39:44.647 --> 39:46.431
Let's take our time,

39:46.433 --> 39:49.016
and really get to know each other.

39:49.018 --> 39:50.184
Let's go slow.

39:50.186 --> 39:53.988
Slow, fast, medium, I don't care...

39:55.692 --> 39:57.992
As long as I have you back in my life.

39:57.994 --> 39:59.827
You got me.

40:07.087 --> 40:09.087
Oh, hey, I'm Alex.

40:09.089 --> 40:11.122
I, uh... Paul Watson.

40:11.124 --> 40:12.623
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

40:12.625 --> 40:14.542
<i>Places! Places, everyone!</i>

40:14.544 --> 40:16.094
Oh, wait. Just wait!

40:17.695 --> 40:19.912
I have great news.

40:19.914 --> 40:21.948
You're going into
business with Warren Saget?

40:21.950 --> 40:23.199
Yup.

40:23.201 --> 40:24.200
Real estate development.

40:24.202 --> 40:26.085
- Really?
- Yes.

40:26.087 --> 40:27.203
Starting with Mom's.

40:27.205 --> 40:28.287
She said she would call you,

40:28.289 --> 40:29.705
decided to stay at the Cape.

40:29.707 --> 40:31.757
She's giving us the house.

40:31.759 --> 40:34.710
We're going to make a fortune.

40:40.518 --> 40:42.301
That is one amazing town photo.

40:42.303 --> 40:44.220
John is a great photographer.

40:44.222 --> 40:46.973
You can't even tell that
I want to strangle Will.

40:46.975 --> 40:49.725
We both know you can't take a bad picture.

40:49.727 --> 40:52.645
You even made braces look good.

40:52.647 --> 40:53.813
Not true, but thank you.

40:53.815 --> 40:57.033
Oh, that is a really
great picture of Warren.

40:57.035 --> 40:58.985
Yeah, great picture of a not so great man.

40:58.987 --> 40:59.986
True.

40:59.988 --> 41:01.821
Oh, look at you,

41:01.823 --> 41:04.373
you're practically glowing.

41:04.375 --> 41:06.242
I'm practically engaged.

41:06.244 --> 41:07.960
I just can't believe

41:07.962 --> 41:11.130
that people put aside
whatever drama they had

41:11.132 --> 41:13.833
just to show up for this photo.

41:13.835 --> 41:15.918
Well, that's Cedar Cove.

41:15.920 --> 41:19.422
Mm, it's the best town in America.
