02:47.160 --> 02:51.802
Jamie is over and Jamie is gone

02:53.680 --> 02:58.447
Jamie's decided it's time to move on

03:00.240 --> 03:04.928
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon

03:05.920 --> 03:11.006
And I'm still hurting

03:17.960 --> 03:22.966
Jamie arrived at the end of the line

03:23.880 --> 03:29.284
Jamie's convinced
that the problems are mine

03:29.880 --> 03:34.329
Jamie is probably feeling just fine

03:35.760 --> 03:40.926
And I'm still hurting

03:47.560 --> 03:50.325
What about lies, Jamie?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.608
What about things

03:52.760 --> 03:58.130
That you swore to be true?

03:58.280 --> 04:01.568
What about you, Jamie?

04:04.400 --> 04:07.529
What about you?

04:09.640 --> 04:14.487
Jamie is sure something wonderful died

04:15.600 --> 04:20.810
Jamie decides it's his right to decide

04:21.800 --> 04:26.806
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide

04:27.000 --> 04:33.042
And I'm still hurting

04:36.360 --> 04:41.048
Go and hide

04:41.200 --> 04:46.331
And run away

04:46.480 --> 04:49.086
Run away

04:49.240 --> 04:55.247
Run and find something better

04:57.640 --> 05:01.884
Go and ride

05:02.040 --> 05:07.251
The sun away

05:07.400 --> 05:09.880
Run away

05:10.080 --> 05:12.447
Like it's simple

05:12.920 --> 05:16.766
Like it's right

05:44.360 --> 05:47.409
Give me a day, Jamie

05:47.560 --> 05:49.369
Bring back the lies

05:49.520 --> 05:54.082
Hang them back on the wall

05:55.040 --> 05:57.520
Maybe I'd see

05:58.200 --> 06:00.282
How you could be

06:00.440 --> 06:02.841
So certain that we

06:03.000 --> 06:06.209
Had no chance

06:07.400 --> 06:09.243
At all

06:12.720 --> 06:17.408
Jamie is over and where can I turn?

06:18.920 --> 06:24.165
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn

06:25.480 --> 06:30.042
Maybe there's somewhere
a lesson to learn

06:31.320 --> 06:36.360
But that wouldn't change the fact

06:37.000 --> 06:41.722
That wouldn't speed the time

06:42.480 --> 06:46.201
Once the foundation's cracked

06:46.360 --> 06:51.446
And I'm

06:53.080 --> 06:58.166
Still hurting

07:45.640 --> 07:47.124
Jamie... Jamie, wait.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.047
I'm breaking my mother's heart

08:07.640 --> 08:10.803
The longer I stand looking at you

08:10.960 --> 08:13.691
The more I hear it splinter and crack

08:13.840 --> 08:17.242
From 90 miles away

08:21.200 --> 08:24.282
I'm breaking my mother's heart

08:24.480 --> 08:27.609
The JCC of Spring Valley is shaking

08:27.760 --> 08:30.161
And crumbling to the ground

08:30.360 --> 08:32.806
And my grandfather's rolling

08:32.960 --> 08:37.169
Rolling in his grave

08:38.880 --> 08:41.884
If you had a tattoo that wouldn't matter

08:42.080 --> 08:44.845
If you had a shaved head
that would be cool

08:45.040 --> 08:48.487
If you came from Spain or Japan
or the back of a van

08:48.640 --> 08:51.450
Just as long as you're
not from Hebrew school

08:51.600 --> 08:54.888
I'd say, "Now I'm getting somewhere!

08:55.040 --> 08:59.090
I'm finally breaking through!"

08:59.240 --> 09:02.642
I'd say, "Hey! Hey! Shiksa goddess!

09:02.800 --> 09:07.328
I've been waiting for someone like you"

09:07.520 --> 09:10.808
Oh, my God! OK, hold on. Hold on.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.006
What's happening?

09:14.160 --> 09:16.208
I have to... I have to take this in.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.563
You don't understand.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.890
I have been waiting through
Danica Schwartz and Erica Weiss

09:25.080 --> 09:26.684
And the Handelman twins

09:26.840 --> 09:30.481
I have been waiting through
Heather Greenblatt, Annie Mincus,

09:30.640 --> 09:33.962
Karen Pincus and Lisa Katz

09:34.120 --> 09:39.843
And Stacey Rosen, Ellen Kaplan,
Julie Silver and Janie Stein

09:40.000 --> 09:42.970
I've had Shabbat dinners
on Friday nights

09:43.120 --> 09:45.964
With every Shapiro
in Washington Heights!

09:46.120 --> 09:48.885
But the minute I first met you

09:49.040 --> 09:51.361
I could barely catch my breath

09:51.520 --> 09:54.922
I've been standing for days
with the phone in my hand

09:55.080 --> 09:57.526
Like an idiot scared to death

09:57.680 --> 10:00.684
I've been wandering through the desert

10:00.840 --> 10:04.049
I've been beaten I've been hit

10:04.200 --> 10:07.409
My people have suffered
for thousands of years

10:07.560 --> 10:09.324
And I don't give a shit

10:09.480 --> 10:12.450
If you had a pierced tongue
that wouldn't matter

10:12.600 --> 10:16.047
If you once were in jail
or you once were a man

10:16.200 --> 10:19.249
If your mother and your brother
had relations with each other

10:19.400 --> 10:23.371
And your father was connected
to the Gotti clan, I'd say,

10:23.560 --> 10:25.164
"Well, nobody's perfect"

10:25.320 --> 10:29.325
It's tragic but it's true

10:29.520 --> 10:33.241
I'd say, "Hey! Hey! Shiksa goddess!

10:33.440 --> 10:37.650
I've been waiting for someone like you"

10:38.880 --> 10:42.566
Breaking the circle

10:42.720 --> 10:45.041
You

10:45.200 --> 10:48.841
Taking the light

10:49.040 --> 10:51.202
You

10:51.360 --> 10:57.367
You are the story I should write

11:00.480 --> 11:06.044
I have to write!

11:06.200 --> 11:09.170
If you drove an RV that wouldn't matter

11:09.320 --> 11:12.483
If you like to drink blood
I think it's cute

11:12.640 --> 11:16.042
If you've got a powerful connection
to your firearm collection

11:16.200 --> 11:18.089
I'd say draw a bead and shoot

11:18.280 --> 11:22.080
I'm your Hebrew slave at your service

11:22.280 --> 11:28.287
Just tell me what to do

11:28.800 --> 11:32.850
I'd say, "Hey, hey, hey...

11:33.040 --> 11:35.850
I've been waiting for someone

11:36.000 --> 11:38.480
I've been praying for someone

11:38.640 --> 11:41.803
I think that I could be in love

11:41.960 --> 11:46.648
With someone

11:47.642 --> 11:52.807
Like you"

12:38.080 --> 12:41.687
I guess I can't believe you really came

12:43.760 --> 12:46.809
And that we're sitting on this pier

12:48.240 --> 12:50.891
See, I'm smiling

12:52.600 --> 12:55.809
That means I'm happy that you're here

13:01.040 --> 13:05.011
I stole this sweater from a costume shop

13:06.840 --> 13:10.491
It makes me look like Daisy Mae

13:11.000 --> 13:13.526
See, we're laughing

13:15.520 --> 13:18.444
I think we're gonna be OK

13:21.400 --> 13:27.043
I mean, we'll have to
try a little harder

13:27.240 --> 13:31.450
And bend things to and fro

13:31.600 --> 13:35.400
To make this love as special

13:35.560 --> 13:40.088
As it was five years ago

13:40.240 --> 13:44.529
I mean you made it to Ohio

13:44.680 --> 13:47.968
Who knows where else

13:48.120 --> 13:50.851
We can go

13:53.280 --> 13:57.444
I think you're really
gonna like this show

13:58.920 --> 14:01.924
I'm pretty sure it doesn't suck

14:03.480 --> 14:05.608
See, you're laughing

14:05.760 --> 14:07.808
And I'm smiling

14:07.960 --> 14:12.204
By a river in Ohio

14:12.360 --> 14:17.207
And you're mine

14:17.360 --> 14:20.125
We're doing fine

14:28.560 --> 14:34.044
I think we both can see
what could be better

14:34.200 --> 14:38.524
I'll own when I was wrong

14:38.680 --> 14:42.924
With all we've had to go through

14:43.080 --> 14:46.084
We'll end up twice as strong

14:46.280 --> 14:51.571
And so we'll start again this weekend

14:51.720 --> 14:57.727
And just keep rolling along

14:58.891 --> 15:01.720
Baby, I... I'm so sorry.
I can't stay this weekend.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.446
I have this stupid Random House thing,
it's tomorrow.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.404
I couldn't get out.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.283
I didn't know you had to go so soon

15:14.440 --> 15:15.680
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.680
I thought we had a little time

15:20.280 --> 15:21.327
I know.

15:21.520 --> 15:25.809
Look, whatever If you have to

15:25.960 --> 15:28.042
Then you have to

15:28.200 --> 15:30.282
So whatever

15:30.440 --> 15:35.241
It's all right

15:35.400 --> 15:38.609
We'll have tonight

15:38.760 --> 15:40.000
Yeah...

15:40.160 --> 15:42.208
See, the thing is, I tried to get
a plane ticket for tomorrow,

15:42.400 --> 15:45.563
but the only ones
available were for tonight.

15:45.720 --> 15:49.850
So... you know, I can come back
on Monday if you want.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.891
You know what makes me crazy?
I'm sorry, can I say this?

15:57.040 --> 16:00.169
You know what makes me nuts?
The fact that we could be together

16:00.320 --> 16:02.561
Here together Sharing our night

16:02.720 --> 16:05.200
Spending our time
And you are gonna choose

16:05.400 --> 16:06.526
Someone else to be with

16:06.680 --> 16:07.681
No, you are

16:07.840 --> 16:08.841
I'm not... That's not true.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.365
Yes, Jamie, that's exactly
what you're doing

16:10.520 --> 16:13.000
You could be here with me
or be there with them

16:13.200 --> 16:14.406
As usual guess which you pick

16:14.560 --> 16:15.561
Baby, I have to go!

16:15.720 --> 16:17.370
No, Jamie, you do not have to go

16:17.520 --> 16:21.206
To another party with the same
20jerks you already know

16:21.360 --> 16:24.250
You could stay with your wife
on her fucking birthday

16:24.400 --> 16:26.721
And you could, God forbid,
even see my show

16:26.920 --> 16:29.810
And I know in your soul
it must drive you crazy

16:29.960 --> 16:31.849
That you won't get to play
with your little girlfriends

16:32.000 --> 16:33.843
- You're being crazy!
- No, I'm not, no, I'm not!

16:34.000 --> 16:35.764
And the point is, Jamie

16:35.920 --> 16:38.890
That you can't spend
a single day that's not about

16:39.040 --> 16:41.805
You and you and nothing but you

16:41.960 --> 16:44.008
"Mahvelous" novelist, you

16:44.160 --> 16:46.970
Isn't he wonderful? Just 28

16:47.120 --> 16:50.044
The savior of writing

16:50.480 --> 16:53.962
You and you and nothing but you

16:54.120 --> 16:56.009
Miles and piles of you

16:56.200 --> 16:58.771
Pushing through windows
and bursting through walls

16:58.920 --> 17:04.608
En route to the sky

17:04.760 --> 17:06.285
And I

17:19.119 --> 17:22.806
I swear to God I'll never understand

17:24.240 --> 17:28.006
How you can stand there
straight and tall

17:29.240 --> 17:31.561
And see I'm crying

17:33.720 --> 17:37.441
And not do anything at all

18:14.920 --> 18:16.843
Yeah, hello?

18:17.960 --> 18:19.962
Yeah, this is Jamie Wellerstein.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.808
Oh, OK.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.810
Sure.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.331
Wait, who? Who told you?

18:31.160 --> 18:34.721
Wait, wait, you...
you read my manuscript?

18:34.920 --> 18:36.490
But how did you...

18:37.160 --> 18:38.889
Oh, oh, yeah, Professor Adler.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.328
No, no, no, no, that's... that's great!

18:42.480 --> 18:46.405
That's... that's... That's really...
It's a second draft, you know.

18:46.600 --> 18:50.161
It's... it's a work in progress,
it's getting there, though.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.607
I'm sorry, who... Random House read it?

18:52.760 --> 18:54.888
Oh, my... that's...

18:56.280 --> 18:58.806
That's great. That's... Holy shit!

18:58.960 --> 19:01.406
I'm sorry... that's...
no, no, no, no, no!

19:01.560 --> 19:02.925
No, no. No.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.044
OK. Yes. Yes.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.010
Yes, I'm 23. I'm...

19:09.160 --> 19:12.403
No, I didn't finish,
but whatever. That's...

19:12.560 --> 19:15.291
Yes, I can meet you. New York.

19:15.440 --> 19:19.047
Yes, I'm in New York. Yeah, I live here.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.283
OK. Yes. I mean, I can come today.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.125
Great. Great. Great. Great. Great.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.089
Oh, my God. OK.

19:27.240 --> 19:29.686
Yes, I will see you there. I am so...

19:29.840 --> 19:34.129
...so looking... looking forward
to meeting you, Ms. Whitfield.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.982
OK. OK. OK, Linda.

19:38.955 --> 19:40.286
We're like friends, Linda.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.967
Uh, OK, great. That's... that's fine.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.254
OK, bye.

19:46.354 --> 19:47.688
What?!

19:51.120 --> 19:52.121
Hi.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.691
Hey, so I was thinking
about what you said.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.848
- Let's move in together.
- Really?!

19:56.000 --> 19:57.809
- Jamie, what happened?
- I'll tell you later, all right?

19:57.960 --> 20:00.440
Just find an apartment, and I love you.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.728
I... Jamie... Jamie, wait!

20:02.920 --> 20:08.006
Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?

20:08.160 --> 20:12.609
Did I see sirens go flying past?

20:12.760 --> 20:16.401
Though I don't know
what tomorrow's bringing

20:16.560 --> 20:18.767
I've got a singular impression

20:18.920 --> 20:21.685
Things are moving too fast

20:21.840 --> 20:26.289
I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater

20:26.440 --> 20:30.889
I'm riding hot as a rocket blast

20:31.080 --> 20:34.641
I just expected it ten years later

20:34.800 --> 20:37.041
I've got a singular impression

20:37.200 --> 20:39.282
Things are moving too fast

20:39.440 --> 20:42.125
And you say "Oh, no, step on the brakes

20:42.280 --> 20:44.806
Do whatever it takes,
but stop this train

20:44.960 --> 20:47.964
Slow, slow, the light's turning red"

20:48.480 --> 20:50.323
But I say "No, no,

20:50.480 --> 20:53.609
Whatever I do I barrel on through
and I don't complain"

20:53.760 --> 20:58.129
No matter what I try
I'm flying full speed ahead

20:58.280 --> 21:03.366
I'm never worried to walk the wire

21:03.520 --> 21:07.969
I won't do anything just half-assed

21:08.160 --> 21:11.562
But with the stakes
getting somewhat higher

21:11.720 --> 21:15.042
I've got a singular impression

21:15.200 --> 21:19.683
That things are moving too fast

21:19.880 --> 21:24.124
I found a woman I love

21:24.280 --> 21:27.921
And I found an agent who loves me

21:28.080 --> 21:29.320
He's like a young Jonathan Franzen.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.527
Things might get bumpy

21:30.720 --> 21:35.203
But some people analyze every detail

21:35.840 --> 21:40.289
Some people stall
when they can't see the trail

21:40.480 --> 21:44.644
Some people freeze out of fear
that they'll fail

21:44.800 --> 21:50.409
But I keep rolling on

21:50.880 --> 21:55.124
Some people can't find
success with their art

21:55.640 --> 21:59.964
Some people never feel
love in their heart

22:00.120 --> 22:04.364
Some people can't tell
the two things apart

22:04.520 --> 22:09.765
But I keep rolling on

22:10.200 --> 22:14.125
Oh, oh

22:14.280 --> 22:18.729
Maybe I can't follow through

22:18.880 --> 22:23.363
But oh, oh

22:23.520 --> 22:27.809
What else am I supposed to do?

22:27.960 --> 22:29.564
Ooh

22:29.720 --> 22:34.362
Hey, Mike, it's Cathy.
Yeah, how are you?

22:34.520 --> 22:37.649
Um, yeah, no, just two quick things.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.848
I'm not going to talk your ear off.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.565
I just wanted to know if you got

22:41.720 --> 22:44.291
the reviews that I sent you
from last summer?

22:44.960 --> 22:47.440
Thank you. Yeah, it's really exciting.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.642
No, the second thing was just...

22:53.440 --> 22:55.647
...if you have anything
you want to send me in on,

22:55.800 --> 22:59.043
I'm sort of suddenly...
free this summer,

22:59.200 --> 23:01.601
I'm, like, available, so...

23:01.760 --> 23:04.684
Yes.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.526
Yeah, as soon as I'm doing something
in the city, I'll let you know.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.241
OK. No, no, no, no, I understand.
OK, thanks.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.085
That wasn't...
that wasn't too painful, was it?

23:17.520 --> 23:20.330
Right. OK.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.682
OK. Bye, Mike.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.450
OK, ladies.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.730
Uh... Mariah, Taylor, Rachel,

23:31.880 --> 23:34.929
Lauren and Sophia.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.082
Follow me to the dance audition.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.323
And everyone else, thank you very much.

23:42.720 --> 23:47.567
I dreamed of writing
like the high and mighty

23:47.720 --> 23:52.009
Now I'm the subject of a bidding war

23:52.200 --> 23:56.524
I met my personal Aphrodite

23:56.680 --> 24:00.730
I'm doing things
I never dreamed of before

24:00.880 --> 24:05.602
We start to take the next step together

24:05.760 --> 24:09.606
Found an apartment on 73rd

24:09.800 --> 24:14.522
The Atlantic Monthly's
printing my first chapter

24:14.720 --> 24:19.123
Two thousand bucks
without rewriting one word

24:19.280 --> 24:23.842
I left Columbia and I don't regret it

24:24.000 --> 24:27.447
I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it

24:27.600 --> 24:29.887
My heart's been stolen

24:30.040 --> 24:32.008
My ego's swollen

24:32.160 --> 24:37.121
I just keep rolling along

24:37.280 --> 24:41.410
Oh

24:41.560 --> 24:42.800
Oh, yeah

24:43.000 --> 24:45.651
And I think "Well, well,
what else is in store?"

24:45.800 --> 24:47.928
Got all this and more before 24

24:48.080 --> 24:52.961
It's hard not to be sure
I'm spinning out of control

24:53.120 --> 24:55.407
Out of control

24:55.560 --> 24:59.963
I'm feeling panicked
and rushed and hurried

25:00.120 --> 25:04.569
I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed

25:04.720 --> 25:08.167
But I'm so happy I can't get worried

25:08.360 --> 25:11.887
About this singular impression

25:12.760 --> 25:17.721
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast

25:17.880 --> 25:18.927
Hi, can I help you?

25:19.120 --> 25:21.043
Yes, hi. I'm looking for Alise Michaels.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.531
- Mr. Wellerstein.
- Yes.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.330
Hey, I'm Dade, Alise's assistant.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.801
- Let me show you the way.
- Oh, great.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.328
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi. Jamie.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.608
- Jamie Wellerstein.
- Alise Michaels.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.201
It is an absolute pleasure to meet you.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.441
- Wow, this is great.
- Have a seat.

25:39.640 --> 25:40.926
Would you like a glass of water?

25:41.080 --> 25:43.890
Yes. Thank you so much for having me.

25:44.080 --> 25:46.970
Everyone in the office
is absolutely thrilled to meet you.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.044
Everybody has been so nice,
from just walking in the door.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.009
- Everyone's a huge fan of the book.
- This is beautiful.

25:52.160 --> 25:56.484
- I've never even been this high up.
- It's a great office. Yes, thank you.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.050
That's great. Thank you.

26:11.320 --> 26:16.201
One day we're just like
Leave It To Beaver

26:16.360 --> 26:21.651
One day it's just a typical life

26:21.800 --> 26:26.806
And then he's off on
a trip to Jamie-land

26:26.960 --> 26:32.410
Staring catatonic out the window

26:33.960 --> 26:39.967
Barely even breathing all the while

26:43.480 --> 26:45.801
And then he'll smile

26:46.000 --> 26:50.483
His eyes light up
and deep within the ground

26:50.640 --> 26:52.768
Without a sound

26:52.960 --> 26:56.487
A moment comes to life

26:56.640 --> 27:02.443
And I'm a part of that

27:02.880 --> 27:10.207
I'm a part of that

27:11.560 --> 27:16.282
Next day it's just like
it never happened

27:16.440 --> 27:18.727
We're making dinners

27:18.880 --> 27:21.326
We're making plans

27:21.480 --> 27:27.089
Then he gets on the
mule train to Jamie-land

27:27.240 --> 27:33.247
Handful after handful of Doritos

27:33.600 --> 27:39.607
Circling the apartment, Logging miles

27:43.240 --> 27:45.766
And then he smiles

27:45.920 --> 27:50.403
His eyes light up
And how can I complain?

27:50.600 --> 27:52.728
Yes, he's insane

27:52.880 --> 27:56.168
But look what he can do

27:56.360 --> 28:02.367
And I'm a part of that

28:02.600 --> 28:10.246
I'm a part of that

28:10.400 --> 28:13.449
And it's true

28:13.600 --> 28:17.844
I tend to follow in his stride

28:18.000 --> 28:20.446
Instead of side by side

28:20.600 --> 28:24.810
I take his cue

28:24.960 --> 28:27.406
True

28:27.600 --> 28:31.764
But there's no question,
there's no doubt

28:31.920 --> 28:34.605
I said I'd stick it out

28:34.760 --> 28:39.721
And follow through

28:41.440 --> 28:47.447
And when I do

28:48.480 --> 28:52.849
Then he smiles

28:53.040 --> 28:55.725
And where else can I go?

28:55.920 --> 28:57.843
I didn't know

28:58.000 --> 29:02.164
The rules do not apply

29:02.320 --> 29:06.644
And then he smiles

29:06.800 --> 29:09.406
And nothing else makes sense

29:09.600 --> 29:11.887
While he invents

29:12.040 --> 29:15.886
The world that's passing by

29:16.040 --> 29:21.444
And I'm a part of that

29:22.520 --> 29:25.000
I'm a part of that

29:26.080 --> 29:29.482
I'm a part of that

29:29.640 --> 29:32.120
Aren't I?

29:34.440 --> 29:39.440
I'm a part of that

30:21.640 --> 30:25.087
Hey. How are you doing, babe?

30:25.680 --> 30:27.091
You did...

30:28.920 --> 30:31.764
Not a very good day at the bar?

30:32.000 --> 30:35.971
I'm sorry. Did you at least,
get some good tips?

30:36.120 --> 30:37.201
Get any...

30:37.360 --> 30:39.044
- Shit!
- Oh.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.088
You look really nice.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.008
Hey... are you working
on anything tonight?

30:47.160 --> 30:50.528
- Like what?
- You know, your photos? The dress?

30:50.680 --> 30:52.728
Like... Don't you have
an audition or something

30:52.880 --> 30:54.245
later this week that
you need to get ready for?

30:54.400 --> 30:56.164
- I'm not going.
- Why?

30:56.320 --> 30:58.846
Because, I'm not going to get it.

30:59.040 --> 31:02.442
Oh, come on, did you call
your agent or anything?

31:02.600 --> 31:04.125
- He's on a retreat.
- Retreat?

31:04.280 --> 31:06.760
What the hell is an agent retreat?

31:06.920 --> 31:09.002
I don't know. They go into the woods

31:09.160 --> 31:11.970
and sacrifice actresses
to breed more agents.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.966
- That's frightening, Cathy.
- I don't make them do it.

31:16.120 --> 31:21.445
Hey, no, look, I have prepared
a little surprise for you

31:21.600 --> 31:24.206
in the form of the story.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.562
- No, baby, please.
- Come on.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.451
- No, I've had such a shitty day.
- No, listen...

31:29.600 --> 31:31.568
I've literally been doing this for hours,
so you're going to sit up

31:31.720 --> 31:34.041
for, like, five minutes and listen, OK?

31:34.600 --> 31:36.841
You know, if I had known
there were going to be this many stories,

31:37.040 --> 31:40.244
- I wouldn't have ever dated a writer.
- Well, too late.

31:40.866 --> 31:43.249
You're going to like it. I promise.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.767
It's a Christmas story.
You like Christmas.

31:45.960 --> 31:49.567
I call it the Story of Schmuel,
the Tailor of Klimovich.

31:49.760 --> 31:53.207
Schmuel would work till half-past ten

31:53.360 --> 31:55.840
At his tailor shop in Klimovich

31:56.000 --> 31:58.367
Get up at dawn and start again

31:58.560 --> 32:01.769
With the hems and pins and twist

32:01.920 --> 32:03.126
Are you going to touch my dress right now?

32:03.280 --> 32:05.726
Forty-one years had come and gone

32:05.880 --> 32:08.326
At his tailor shop in Klimovich

32:08.480 --> 32:10.881
Watching the winters soldier on

32:11.040 --> 32:13.725
There was one thing Schmuel missed

32:13.880 --> 32:14.961
Are you ready for this?

32:15.160 --> 32:17.891
"If I only had time" old Schmuel said

32:18.080 --> 32:20.845
"I would build
the dress that's in my head

32:21.040 --> 32:23.850
A dress to fire the mad desire

32:24.040 --> 32:26.520
Of girls from here to Minsk

32:26.680 --> 32:32.130
But I have no more hours left to sew"

32:32.280 --> 32:38.287
Then the clock upon the wall
began to glow

32:40.240 --> 32:41.401
And the clock said

32:41.600 --> 32:43.523
"Na na na na, na na na

32:43.680 --> 32:46.445
Oh, Schmuel you'll get to be happy

32:46.600 --> 32:50.924
Na na na na, na na na
I give you unlimited time"

32:51.080 --> 32:54.323
- It's a magical clock.
- I've never been more attracted to you.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.211
"So Schmuel
Go sew and be happy"

32:57.360 --> 33:00.682
But Schmuel said
"No, no, it's not my lot

33:00.840 --> 33:05.448
I've gotta make do
with the time I've got

33:05.600 --> 33:09.844
Oh, look at the time. It's time to go.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.684
Here we go.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.882
Why do all my things
have to come into this?

33:14.040 --> 33:16.008
Schmuel was done at half-past ten

33:16.160 --> 33:18.731
And he said "Good night, old Klimovich"

33:18.880 --> 33:21.281
Put on his coat to go
But then

33:21.440 --> 33:23.920
The clock cried
"Wait! Not yet"

33:24.080 --> 33:25.684
Pretty good, right?

33:25.840 --> 33:28.161
"Even though you're not wise or rich

33:28.360 --> 33:30.931
You're the finest man in Klimovich

33:31.080 --> 33:33.560
Listen up, Schmuel
Make one stitch

33:33.720 --> 33:36.769
And you'll see what you get"

33:37.840 --> 33:40.650
But Schmuel said
"Clock, it's much too late

33:40.800 --> 33:43.406
I'm at peace with life I accept my fate"

33:43.560 --> 33:46.564
But the clock said "Schmuel!
One stitch and you will

33:46.720 --> 33:49.200
Unlock the dreams you've lost"

33:49.360 --> 33:54.890
So Schmuel, with reluctance,
took his thread

33:55.040 --> 34:00.285
He pulled a bolt of velvet and he said

34:00.440 --> 34:06.368
"I should take out my teeth
and go to bed

34:06.560 --> 34:09.928
I'm sitting here with talking clocks

34:10.080 --> 34:14.130
Instead"

34:14.320 --> 34:16.971
And the clock said
"Na na na na, na na na

34:17.120 --> 34:19.851
Oh, Schmuel you'll get to be happy"

34:20.000 --> 34:21.001
And then they dance.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.531
Na na na na, na na na

34:22.679 --> 34:24.284
No. No, thank you.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.001
Come on!

34:26.159 --> 34:27.730
Na na na na, na na na

34:27.880 --> 34:31.726
"Just do it and you can be happy"

34:31.920 --> 34:34.400
So Schmuel put the thread
through the needle's eye

34:34.560 --> 34:38.360
And the moon stared down
from a starless sky

34:39.199 --> 34:41.965
And he pushed the thread
through the velvet black

34:42.120 --> 34:47.126
And he looked, and the clock
was turning back

34:47.280 --> 34:50.284
So he grabbed his shears
and he cut some lace

34:50.480 --> 34:54.530
As the hands reversed
on the old clock's face

34:54.679 --> 34:57.524
And his fingers flew
and the fabric swirled

34:57.680 --> 35:02.163
It was 9:15 all around the world

35:02.320 --> 35:05.802
Every cut and stitch was a perfect fit

35:05.960 --> 35:09.043
As if God Himself were controlling it

35:09.200 --> 35:12.807
And Schmuel cried
through a rush of tears

35:13.000 --> 35:14.729
"Take me back

35:14.920 --> 35:20.927
Take me back all 41 years"

35:28.320 --> 35:31.005
And on it went

35:31.160 --> 35:33.606
Down that silent street

35:33.760 --> 35:36.047
Till Schmuel's dress

35:36.200 --> 35:39.727
Was at last complete

35:39.880 --> 35:42.645
And he stretched his arms

35:42.800 --> 35:46.202
And he closed his eyes

35:46.360 --> 35:49.284
And the morning sun

35:49.440 --> 35:53.161
Finally started

35:53.320 --> 35:57.245
To rise

35:59.480 --> 36:02.882
And the dress he made
on that endless night

36:03.040 --> 36:06.044
Was a dress that would make
any soul take flight

36:06.200 --> 36:09.204
Not a swatch, not a skein
had gone to waste

36:09.360 --> 36:12.728
Every ribbon and button ideally placed

36:12.880 --> 36:16.566
And sewn into the seams

36:16.720 --> 36:22.284
Were 41 seasons of dreams

36:22.680 --> 36:26.366
Dreams that you could feel

36:26.520 --> 36:29.364
Coming real

36:29.520 --> 36:31.010
Come on.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.968
And that very dress so the papers swore

36:37.120 --> 36:40.169
Was the dress a girl in Odessa wore

36:40.320 --> 36:43.449
On the day she promised forevermore

36:43.600 --> 36:49.403
To love a young man named Schmuel

36:51.000 --> 36:54.641
Who only one day before

36:54.800 --> 37:00.284
Had knocked at her kitchen door

37:02.040 --> 37:03.485
Thank you.

37:03.640 --> 37:06.530
That was pretty long, but it was fun.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.727
Oh, it's not over yet.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.406
Plenty have hoped and dreamed and prayed

37:11.560 --> 37:15.724
But they can't get out of Klimovich

37:15.920 --> 37:18.764
If Schmuel had been a cute goyishe maid

37:18.960 --> 37:22.282
He'd have looked a lot like you

37:22.440 --> 37:25.887
- Sorry, I'm Schmuel in this story!?
- Oh, yeah.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.371
I'm not the girl from Odessa?

37:27.520 --> 37:30.922
Maybe it's just that
you're afraid to go out

37:31.080 --> 37:35.369
On to a limb... ovich

37:36.720 --> 37:39.564
Maybe your heart's completely swayed

37:39.720 --> 37:42.007
But your head can't follow through

37:44.360 --> 37:47.170
But shouldn't I want the world to see

37:47.320 --> 37:49.687
The brilliant girl who inspires me?

37:49.840 --> 37:52.730
Don't you think that
now's a good time to be

37:52.880 --> 37:56.043
The ambitious freak you are?

37:56.240 --> 38:00.086
Say goodbye to wiping
ashtrays at the bar

38:00.240 --> 38:01.401
Come on.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.961
Say hello to Cathy Hiatt

38:04.120 --> 38:09.729
A big-time star

38:11.040 --> 38:12.041
'Cause I say

38:12.200 --> 38:13.770
"Na na na na, na na na na

38:13.920 --> 38:16.844
Cathy, you get to be happy

38:17.000 --> 38:22.325
Na na na na, na na na
I give you unlimited time

38:22.480 --> 38:28.044
Na na na na na na na
Stop temping and go, go be happy"

38:28.240 --> 38:31.164
Here's a headshot guy
and a new Backstage

38:31.320 --> 38:34.210
Where you're right for
something on every page

38:34.360 --> 38:37.250
Take a breath
Take a step

38:37.400 --> 38:42.281
Take a chance

38:43.600 --> 38:47.889
Take your time

39:00.080 --> 39:02.845
Have I mentioned today

39:04.440 --> 39:07.444
How lucky I am

39:07.600 --> 39:11.082
To be in love

39:12.240 --> 39:15.687
With you

39:50.480 --> 39:52.209
Hi.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.721
I could have a mansion on a hill

40:03.920 --> 40:07.242
I could lease a villa in Seville

40:07.400 --> 40:11.166
But it wouldn't be as nice
as a summer in Ohio

40:11.320 --> 40:13.846
With a gay midget named Karl

40:14.000 --> 40:16.651
Playing Tevye and Porgy

40:16.800 --> 40:19.724
God... Wow.

40:21.600 --> 40:25.491
I could wander Paris after dark

40:25.640 --> 40:28.883
Take a carriage ride
through Central Park

40:29.040 --> 40:32.487
But it wouldn't be as nice
as a summer in Ohio

40:32.640 --> 40:36.725
Where I'm sharing a room
with a former stripper and her snake

40:36.880 --> 40:38.450
- I love you.
- Wayne.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.886
Oh, my God!

40:40.120 --> 40:42.407
I could have a satchel

40:42.560 --> 40:45.006
Full of dollar bills

40:45.160 --> 40:47.083
Cures for all the nation's ills

40:47.240 --> 40:48.241
Oh!

40:48.400 --> 40:53.566
Pills to make a lion purr

40:54.520 --> 40:59.048
I could be in line
to be the British queen

40:59.200 --> 41:01.248
Look like I was 17

41:01.400 --> 41:02.401
Wow.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.080
Still I'm certain I'd prefer

41:05.240 --> 41:08.130
To be going slowly batty

41:08.280 --> 41:12.251
Forty miles east of Cincinnati

41:16.760 --> 41:20.207
I could shove an ice pick in my eye

41:20.360 --> 41:23.489
I could eat some fish from last July

41:23.640 --> 41:27.201
But it wouldn't be as awful
as a summer in Ohio

41:27.360 --> 41:29.249
Without cable, hot water

41:29.400 --> 41:33.121
Vietnamese food or you

41:34.840 --> 41:36.410
Oh, baby, I love you.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.847
I saw your book at a Target

41:39.000 --> 41:44.040
In Kentucky under a sign that said
"new and recommended"

41:44.200 --> 41:47.682
I stole a look at your
picture on the inside sleeve

41:47.840 --> 41:51.925
And then I couldn't leave

41:52.480 --> 41:55.643
Richard, who was with me
got uncharacteristically quiet

41:55.800 --> 41:59.282
And he said, "All things considered,
I guess you don't have to buy it"

41:59.440 --> 42:05.447
So I smile like Mona Lisa
and I lay my Visa down

42:06.600 --> 42:09.968
He wants me
He wants me

42:10.120 --> 42:13.010
But he ain't gonna get me

42:13.160 --> 42:14.161
Damn right!

42:14.320 --> 42:16.891
I've found my guiding light

42:17.040 --> 42:20.249
I tell the stars each night

42:20.400 --> 42:23.961
Look at me
Look at him

42:24.360 --> 42:30.402
Son of a bitch,
I guess I'm doing something right

42:31.160 --> 42:37.202
I finally got something right

42:40.360 --> 42:44.649
No, it's not Nirvana but it's on the way

42:44.800 --> 42:48.327
I play Anita at the matinee

42:48.480 --> 42:50.960
Then I'll get on my knees and pray

42:51.120 --> 42:53.964
I can state in my next bio

42:54.120 --> 42:59.081
I'm never gonna go back to Ohio

42:59.240 --> 43:03.404
I could chew on tin foil for a spell

43:03.600 --> 43:07.047
I could get a root canal in hell

43:07.200 --> 43:09.202
But it wouldn't be as swell

43:09.360 --> 43:14.321
As this summer is gonna be

43:14.480 --> 43:17.848
'Cause the torture is just exquisite

43:18.000 --> 43:21.163
While I'm waiting for you to visit

43:21.320 --> 43:23.641
So hurry up, schmuck

43:23.800 --> 43:28.249
Get unstuck and get on the scene

43:28.400 --> 43:31.006
Love the midget, the stripper,

43:31.160 --> 43:35.722
Wayne the snake
and Mrs. Jamie Wellerstein

43:35.920 --> 43:41.927
That's me

44:08.200 --> 44:11.522
No, that one's Jerry Seinfeld

44:12.400 --> 44:15.563
That one's John Lennon there

44:16.200 --> 44:18.680
No, the Dakota

44:18.880 --> 44:22.930
The San Remo is up a few blocks

44:23.760 --> 44:28.209
Have you been inside the museum?

44:28.360 --> 44:30.601
We should go

44:32.600 --> 44:35.171
Meet the dinosaurs

44:36.880 --> 44:39.531
Cathy

44:56.000 --> 44:59.800
Will you share your life with me

44:59.960 --> 45:03.601
For the next ten minutes?

45:03.800 --> 45:07.043
For the next ten minutes

45:07.200 --> 45:10.841
We can handle that

45:11.000 --> 45:14.368
We could watch the waves

45:14.560 --> 45:18.007
We could watch the sky

45:18.160 --> 45:21.801
Or just sit and wait

45:21.960 --> 45:25.123
As the time ticks by

45:25.320 --> 45:28.529
And if we make it till then

45:29.000 --> 45:33.210
Could I ask you again

45:33.360 --> 45:36.364
For another ten?

45:40.000 --> 45:44.562
And if you in turn agree

45:44.760 --> 45:48.287
To the next ten minutes

45:48.440 --> 45:52.001
And the next ten minutes

45:52.160 --> 45:55.642
Till the morning comes

45:55.800 --> 45:59.486
Then just holding you

45:59.640 --> 46:02.450
Might compel me to

46:02.600 --> 46:06.525
Ask you for more

46:10.600 --> 46:16.528
There are so many lives
I want to share with you

46:18.720 --> 46:23.089
I will never be complete

46:23.240 --> 46:29.168
Until I do

46:41.120 --> 46:44.647
I am not always on time

46:44.800 --> 46:47.929
Please don't expect that from me

46:48.080 --> 46:51.687
I will be late
But if you can just wait

46:51.840 --> 46:55.447
I will make it eventually

46:55.600 --> 46:58.843
Not like it's in my control

46:59.040 --> 47:02.442
Not like I'm proud of the fact

47:02.600 --> 47:07.288
But anything other than
being exactly on time

47:07.440 --> 47:09.727
I can do

47:11.160 --> 47:14.926
I don't know why people run

47:15.160 --> 47:18.801
I don't know why things fall through

47:18.960 --> 47:22.965
I don't know how anybody
survives in this life

47:23.120 --> 47:26.090
Without someone like you

47:26.280 --> 47:29.762
I could protect and preserve

47:29.920 --> 47:33.970
I could say no and goodbye

47:34.160 --> 47:38.210
But why, Jamie?

47:38.360 --> 47:41.364
Why?

47:41.520 --> 47:47.482
I want to be your wife

47:48.840 --> 47:54.847
I want to bear your child

47:56.600 --> 48:01.640
I want to die, knowing I

48:01.800 --> 48:04.724
Had a long, full life

48:04.880 --> 48:10.887
In your arms

48:11.040 --> 48:16.524
That I can do

48:18.320 --> 48:23.201
- Forever, with you
- Will you share your life with me?

48:23.360 --> 48:27.206
- Forever
- For the next ten lifetimes?

48:27.360 --> 48:31.524
- Forever, Jamie
- For a million summers?

48:31.720 --> 48:35.088
Till the world explodes

48:35.240 --> 48:38.642
Till there's no one left

48:38.800 --> 48:44.807
Who has ever known us apart

48:49.880 --> 48:54.010
There are so many dreams
I need to see with you

48:54.200 --> 48:57.602
There are so many years
I need to be with you

48:57.760 --> 49:01.321
I will never be complete

49:01.480 --> 49:05.963
I will never be alive

49:06.120 --> 49:12.127
I will never change the world

49:14.800 --> 49:20.330
Until I do

49:20.480 --> 49:25.480
I do

49:30.640 --> 49:36.647
I

49:38.760 --> 49:42.481
Do

50:34.640 --> 50:38.486
Is that one John Lennon?

50:41.000 --> 50:43.924
That's the San Remo?

50:46.360 --> 50:49.762
Isn't that the museum?

50:52.840 --> 50:57.971
Can we go see the dinosaurs?

51:35.680 --> 51:37.330
Thank you.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.971
Are you kidding me?

51:41.360 --> 51:44.330
Everyone tells you that
the minute you get married

51:44.480 --> 51:47.370
Every other woman in the world
suddenly finds you attractive

51:47.520 --> 51:49.170
Well, that's not true

51:49.520 --> 51:52.410
It only affects the kind of women
you always wanted to sleep with

51:52.560 --> 51:54.881
But they wouldn't give you
the time of day before

51:55.040 --> 51:58.840
And now they're banging down your door,
and falling to their knees

51:59.000 --> 52:02.368
At least that's what it feels like
because you can not touch them!

52:02.520 --> 52:04.124
In fact, you can't even look at them

52:04.280 --> 52:06.681
Close your eyes
Close your eyes

52:06.840 --> 52:07.841
Close your eyes

52:08.000 --> 52:10.571
Except you're sitting there
eating your corned beef sandwich

52:10.720 --> 52:12.688
And all of a sudden,
this pair of breasts walks by

52:12.840 --> 52:14.683
And smiles at you and you're like,

52:14.840 --> 52:16.205
"That's not fair"

52:16.400 --> 52:17.686
And in a perfect world

52:17.840 --> 52:19.729
A miracle would happen

52:19.880 --> 52:23.521
And every other girl would fly away

52:23.680 --> 52:27.162
And it'd be me and Cathy
and nothing else would matter

52:27.320 --> 52:31.370
But it's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, I mean, I'm happy

52:31.520 --> 52:34.922
And I'm fine, I'm fine
I'm fine, it's not a problem

52:35.080 --> 52:38.050
It's just a challenge
it's a challenge to resist

52:38.200 --> 52:41.249
Temptation

52:46.880 --> 52:50.407
And I have to say that
what exacerbates the problem

52:50.600 --> 52:52.489
ls I'm at these parties
I'm the center of attention

52:52.640 --> 52:55.291
I'm the grand fromage
And here she comes

52:55.480 --> 52:58.563
"Let's get a cup of coffee
Will you look at my manuscript?"

52:58.720 --> 53:02.645
And I'm showing her my left hand,
I'm gesticulating with my left hand

53:02.800 --> 53:06.122
And then, whoa! There's Cathy!
Because she knows, they always know

53:06.280 --> 53:07.884
And there's that really awkward moment

53:08.080 --> 53:09.844
Where I try to show
I wasn't encouraging this

53:10.040 --> 53:11.041
Which of course I was

53:11.200 --> 53:12.884
And I don't want to look whipped
in front of this woman

53:13.080 --> 53:18.086
Which is dumb, I shouldn't care what
she thinks since I can't touch her anyway!

53:18.280 --> 53:21.887
And in a perfect world,
a miracle would happen

53:22.040 --> 53:25.362
And every girl would look like Mister Ed

53:26.120 --> 53:29.488
And it'd be me and Cathy
and nothing else would matter

53:29.680 --> 53:33.571
But it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
You know I love her

53:33.720 --> 53:37.406
And it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
it's what I wanted

53:37.560 --> 53:41.121
And I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
it's not a problem

53:41.320 --> 53:44.164
It's just a challenge
It's a challenge to resist

53:44.360 --> 53:50.367
Temptation

53:52.320 --> 53:54.641
Hi, Mr. Wellerstein.
I'll let Alise know you're here.

53:59.160 --> 54:02.164
When you come home to me

54:03.840 --> 54:07.287
I'll wear a sweeter smile

54:07.440 --> 54:13.368
And hope that, for a while, you'll stay

54:13.560 --> 54:17.645
When you come home to me

54:17.800 --> 54:21.168
Your hand will touch my face

54:21.360 --> 54:27.367
And banish any trace of gray

54:28.280 --> 54:32.763
Soon, a love will rise anew

54:32.920 --> 54:37.323
Even greater than the joy I felt

54:37.480 --> 54:41.485
Just missing you

54:41.640 --> 54:46.726
And once again, I'll be

54:46.880 --> 54:52.205
So proud to call you mine

54:52.360 --> 54:57.321
When finally you come home

54:57.520 --> 55:02.162
To me

55:02.360 --> 55:04.681
- That was lovely.
- Really great.

55:04.840 --> 55:07.684
- Thank you.
- Thank you. OK.

55:10.240 --> 55:13.005
No, it went really, really well. Yeah.

55:13.200 --> 55:15.282
No, I think I got it.

55:15.440 --> 55:18.887
I mean, I hope. Yeah.
It's off Broadway, so...

55:19.080 --> 55:21.321
Please, God, no more Ohio.

55:21.480 --> 55:25.166
Um, I don't where I'm walking, actually.

55:25.320 --> 55:26.704
You have to come find me.

55:27.440 --> 55:31.126
I'll be there soon, Cathy

55:31.280 --> 55:34.363
I'll finish up this chapter
and be out the door

55:34.560 --> 55:38.531
I swear I'll be there soon, Cathy

55:38.680 --> 55:42.287
Don't give up on me yet

55:42.480 --> 55:46.530
I am so proud of you, baby

55:46.680 --> 55:50.321
You're doing what you
never got to do before

55:50.480 --> 55:54.121
And I will be there ripe and crawling

55:54.280 --> 55:58.080
If frigging Random House stops calling

55:58.240 --> 56:01.528
Don't lose faith
Don't get down

56:01.680 --> 56:07.687
Don't despair

56:08.680 --> 56:14.722
I'll be there

56:16.480 --> 56:20.963
And in a perfect world

56:21.120 --> 56:24.647
A miracle would happen

56:24.800 --> 56:30.807
And that day would finally be here

56:31.800 --> 56:34.280
And it'd be me and you

56:34.480 --> 56:35.970
Riding it together

56:36.200 --> 56:39.602
And the things we do
going like we planned

56:39.760 --> 56:42.001
We're gonna make it through

56:42.160 --> 56:43.366
And nothing else will matter

56:43.520 --> 56:45.329
We'll be fine
We're fine

56:45.480 --> 56:47.403
We're fine
We're fine

56:47.560 --> 56:52.885
We're fine
We're fine, we're fine

56:55.840 --> 56:59.765
I'll be there soon, Cathy

57:01.640 --> 57:05.611
I swear I will

57:20.360 --> 57:24.524
When you come home to me

57:24.680 --> 57:26.682
I'll wear a sweeter smile

57:26.880 --> 57:28.769
And hope that for a while you'll...

57:31.560 --> 57:34.564
OK. Thank you.

57:48.160 --> 57:51.050
I'm climbing uphill, Jamie

57:51.200 --> 57:52.884
Climbing uphill

57:54.920 --> 57:57.924
I'm up every morning at six

57:58.400 --> 58:01.404
And standing in line with 200 girls

58:01.600 --> 58:04.888
Who are younger and thinner than me

58:05.080 --> 58:08.209
Who have already been to the gym

58:10.200 --> 58:13.443
I'm waiting five hours in line

58:13.600 --> 58:17.002
And watching the girls
just coming and going

58:17.160 --> 58:19.401
In dresses that look just like this

58:19.600 --> 58:20.681
Cathy Hiatt.

58:20.840 --> 58:23.844
Until my number is finally called

58:25.760 --> 58:29.128
When I walk in the room,
there's a table of men

58:29.280 --> 58:32.602
Always men, usually gay

58:32.760 --> 58:35.969
Who've been sitting like I have
and listening all day

58:36.120 --> 58:42.082
To 200 girls belting as high as they can

58:42.240 --> 58:45.483
I am a good person

58:45.640 --> 58:49.008
I'm an attractive person

58:49.160 --> 58:52.323
I am a talented person

58:52.480 --> 58:58.487
Grant me grace

59:00.080 --> 59:02.606
When you come home

59:02.760 --> 59:04.683
I should have told them
I was sick last week

59:04.840 --> 59:06.001
They're gonna think
this is the way I sing

59:06.160 --> 59:07.605
Why is the pianist playing so loud?

59:07.760 --> 59:09.888
Should I sing louder? I'll sing louder

59:10.040 --> 59:11.405
Maybe I should stop and start over

59:11.560 --> 59:13.164
I'm gonna stop and start over

59:13.360 --> 59:15.044
Why is the director staring
at his crotch?

59:15.200 --> 59:17.441
Why is that man staring at my resume?

59:17.600 --> 59:19.204
Don't stare at my resume

59:19.360 --> 59:21.249
I made up half of my resume
Look at me

59:21.400 --> 59:22.686
Stop looking at that
Look at me

59:22.840 --> 59:24.569
No, not at my shoes
Don't look at my shoes

59:24.720 --> 59:26.529
I hate these stupid shoes

59:26.680 --> 59:27.966
Why did I pick these shoes

59:28.120 --> 59:29.451
Why did I pick this song?

59:29.600 --> 59:30.931
Why did I pick this career?

59:31.080 --> 59:33.242
Why?

59:33.400 --> 59:35.050
Does this pianist hate me?

59:35.200 --> 59:36.850
If I don't get a callback

59:37.000 --> 59:38.570
I can go to Crate and Barrel
with mom and buy a couch

59:38.760 --> 59:40.762
Not that I want to spend a day with mom

59:40.920 --> 59:42.081
But Jamie needs space to write

59:42.240 --> 59:44.242
Since I'm obviously such a horrible

59:44.400 --> 59:45.606
Annoying distraction to him

59:45.760 --> 59:48.843
What's he gonna
be like when we have kids?

59:49.760 --> 59:52.161
And once again

59:52.320 --> 59:53.924
Why am I working so hard?

59:54.080 --> 59:56.970
These are the people who cast
Russell Crowe in a musical

59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.967
Jesus Christ, I suck
I suck, I suck

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.366
When finally you come home...

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.249
Thanks. That's great.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.281
Thank you.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.490
Thank you very much.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.361
Thank you.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.121
Thank you. Thanks very much.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.050
"He touched the wall
and decided he had had enough.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.282
He was exhausted, first of all,
and he could feel it:

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.761
his lungs were throbbing and heavy,

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.402
and his left arm was stinging
from the shoulder right down to his wrist.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.042
Besides that, seven laps in
and the water was still freezing cold,

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.601
and if he wanted to be honest
about it, he felt foolish.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.288
A ghost-pale graceless thing
flapping about frantically,

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.047
desperately trying to keep pace
with the mermaid in the next lane.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.207
He watched her.
He watched her back stretching,

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.648
watched how she seemed
to ride the water.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.964
He didn't recognize the
fierceness in her brow..."

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.243
I will not be the girl stuck
at home in the 'burbs

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.523
With the baby, the dog
and a garden of herbs

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.843
I will not be the girl
in the sensible shoes

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.243
Pushing burgers and beer nuts
and missing the clues

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.563
I will not be the girl
who gets asked how it feels

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.883
To be trotting along
at the genius's heels

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.087
I will not be the girl
who requires a man to get by

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.361
And I

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.931
"He recognized her... 'I see you.'

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.768
Her clenched jaw,
her sharp turns away from him.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.164
'You don't have to let me win,'
she had been screaming,

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.164
but he couldn't hear it at all."

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.607
- Ouch.
- I'm so proud of you!

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.241
Beautiful. From Random House, David.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.006
- Oh, David.
- And Kathryn Marrow.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.004
And this is his agent, Mrs. Whitfield.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.085
Hello. A pleasure to meet you.
Hello, hello. A pleasure to meet you.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.801
Wasn't he wonderful?

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.540
And I've been to every one of them.
I've been to so many.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.962
And the same thing happens, I'm basically
your waitress for the evening,

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.726
I'm bringing you drinks.
I get asked if I'm your publicist,

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.929
because everybody asks me
to take pictures of you on their phone,

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.924
and these people, they ask me
the same things every time.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.570
"How did you and Jamie meet?
What's Jamie like?"

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.327
Baby, I'm so sorry they ask you
the same questions.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.769
No one would notice if I didn't go.
You beg me to go and you abandon me

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.287
and I stand by the bar all night
and I'm drinking!

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.410
I'm holding my purse and I'm waiting
for somebody to come talk to me.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.404
- You certainly don't talk to me!
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.643
God, just stop and listen to me!

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.010
Can we just, for, like, two minutes,

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.324
have a conversation without you
contradicting everything I say?

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.164
Two minutes!

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.561
And then fine, you can
say whatever you want.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.931
OK, look, there are people...

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.209
And they are publishing my book.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.610
And there's a party
that they are throwing.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.964
And while you've made it very
clear that you're not going,

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.766
I will be going.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.729
And that's done.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.481
But what's it really about?

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.843
Is it really about a party, Cathy?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.970
Can we please,
for a minute, stop blaming

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.805
And say what you feel?

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.284
Is it just that you're disappointed

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.927
To be going again to Ohio?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.686
Did you think
this would all be much easier

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.650
Than it's turned out to be?

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.444
Well, then talk to me, Cathy

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.080
Talk to me

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.850
If I didn't believe in you

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.766
We'd never have gotten this far

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.725
If I didn't believe in you

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.805
And all of the 10, 000 women you are

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.363
If I didn't think you could do

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.161
Anything you ever wanted to

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:56.367
If I wasn't certain
that you'd come through somehow

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.561
The fact of the matter is, Cathy

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.123
I wouldn't be standing here now

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:17.169
If I didn't believe in you

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.847
We wouldn't be having this fight

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.247
If I didn't believe in you

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.161
I'd walk out the door
and say, "Cathy, you're right"

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.604
But I never could let that go

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.526
Knowing the things about you I know

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.287
Things, when I met you four years ago

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.568
I knew

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.926
It never took much convincing

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.846
To make me believe in you

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.881
Don't we get to be happy, Cathy?

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.122
At some point down the line

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.521
Don't we get to relax

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.409
Without some new tsuris

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.810
To push me yet further from you?

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.568
And if I'm cheering on your side, Cathy

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.927
Why can't you support mine?

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.971
Why do I have to feel
I've committed some felony

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:25.007
Doing what I always swore I would do?

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.401
I don't want you to hurt

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.971
Hey, hey.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:33.330
I don't want you to sink

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.721
But you know what I think?

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.043
I think you'll be fine

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.569
Just hang on and you'll see

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:47.770
But don't make me wait till you do
to be happy with you

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.005
Will you listen to me?

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.960
No one can give you courage

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.566
No one can thicken your skin

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.601
I will not fail
so you can be comfortable, Cathy

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:10.441
I will not lose because you can't win

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.241
If I didn't believe in you

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:29.530
And, and here's where
the travelogue ends

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.565
If I didn't believe in you

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:39.286
I couldn't have stood
before all of our friends

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.411
And said "This is the life I choose

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.451
This is the thing I can't bear to lose

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.925
Trip us or trap us
but we refuse to fall"

01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.128
That's what I thought we agreed on

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.964
Cathy

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.524
If I hadn't believed in you

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:15.091
I wouldn't have loved you at all

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.484
Baby...

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.130
Baby, just... just
please, put on your dress,

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:29.649
and we'll go to this stupid party.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.600
And we... Can you just do
that for me, Cathy, please?

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.081
Cathy? Where are you going?

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.448
Cathy? Cathy?!

01:08:40.171 --> 01:08:42.126
Cathy! Stop!

01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.805
Uh, you know they're gonna love me.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.121
I'm sure they will.

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:02.685
Come on.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:04.527
Hello, Mr. Hiatt.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.765
Uh, may I please have pre-marital sex
with your daughter? Thank you.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.308
Oh, my God!

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.171
My best friend had a little situation

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:25.448
At the end of our senior year

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.201
And like a shot she and Mitchell
got married that summer

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.447
Carol Ann getting bigger every minute

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.490
Thinking "What am I doing here?"

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.408
While Mitchell's out every night
being a heavy-metal drummer

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.923
They got a little cute house
on a little cute street

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.725
With a crucifix on the door

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.248
Mitchell got a job
at a record store in the mall

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.403
Just the typical facts of a typical life

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:02.769
In a town on the Eastern Shore

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.964
I thought about what I wanted

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.964
It wasn't like that at all

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.249
Made Carol Ann a cute baby sweater

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.370
Thinking I can do better than that

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.641
- Ow!
- Please just drive. Please just drive!

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.646
In a year or so I moved to the city

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.804
Thinking "What have I got to lose?"

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.411
Got a room, got a cat
and got 20 pounds thinner

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:45.408
Met a guy in a class I was taking
with some very well placed tattoos

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.526
He wouldn't leave me alone
'less I went with him to dinner

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.722
And I guess he was cute
and I guess he was sweet

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.804
And I guess he was good in bed

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.809
I gave up my life
for a better part of a year

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:07.249
So I'm starting to think
that this maybe might work

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.722
And the second it entered my head

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.884
He needed to take some time off

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.731
Focus on his career

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.009
He blew me off with a heartfelt letter

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.164
I thought, "I can do better than that"

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.608
You don't have to get a haircut

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.724
You don't have to change your shoes

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.089
You don't have to like Duran Duran

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.321
Just one song!

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.090
Just love me

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.403
You don't have to put the seat down

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.769
You don't have to watch the news

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.685
You don't have to learn to tango

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.208
You don't have to eat prosciutto

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.647
You don't have to change a thing

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:58.728
Just stay with me

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.805
I want you and you and nothing but you

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.241
Miles and piles of you

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.370
Finally, I'll have something worthwhile

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.683
To think of each morning

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.208
You and you and nothing but you

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.727
No substitution will do

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.963
Nothing but fresh undiluted and pure

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:26.365
Top of the line

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:32.527
And totally mine

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.686
I don't need any lifetime commitments

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.730
I don't need to get hitched tonight

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.731
I don't want you to throw up
all your walls and defenses

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.087
I don't mean to put on any pressure

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.244
But I know when a thing is right

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.562
And I spend every day
reconfiguring my senses

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.642
When we get to my house
take a look at that town

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.167
Take a look at how far I've gone

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:10.362
I will never go back
Never look back anymore

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.167
And it feels like my life
led right to your side

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.324
And will keep me there from now on

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.848
Think about what you wanted

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.771
Think about what could be

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.964
Think about how I love you

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.090
And say you'll move in with me

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.164
Think of what's great about me and you

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.085
Think of the bullshit
we've both been through

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:42.247
Think of what's past
because we can do better

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.530
We can do better

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:55.687
We can do better than that

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.329
We can do better than that

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.008
Hey, kid

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.685
Good morning

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.847
You look like an angel

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.604
I don't remember

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.685
When we fell asleep

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.647
We should get up, kid

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.441
Cathy is waiting

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.481
Look at us, lying here

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.167
Dreaming, pretending

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.364
I made a promise

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.605
And I took a vow

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.684
I wrote a story

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.129
And we changed the ending

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:32.287
Cathy, just look at me now

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.045
Hold on

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.488
Facts are facts

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.082
Just relax

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.689
Lay low

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.526
All right

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.890
The panic recedes

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.681
Nobody needs

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:07.210
To know

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.404
Put on my armor

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.243
I'm off to Ohio

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.003
Back into battle

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.210
Till I don't know when

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.882
Swearing to her that I

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.362
Never was with you

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.204
And praying

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:47.367
I'll hold you again

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.445
Hold on

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.286
Clip these wings

01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:01.322
Things get out of hand

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.000
All right

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.004
It's over It's done

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:17.162
No one will understand

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:27.247
No one will understand

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.842
We build a tree house

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.891
I keep it from shaking

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:54.047
Little more glue
every time that it breaks

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:58.123
Perfectly balanced

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:01.841
And then I start making

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.604
The conscious

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:09.767
Deliberate mistakes

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.323
All that I ask for

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:20.326
ls one little corner

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.051
One private room

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.489
At the back of my heart

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.763
Tell her I found one

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.686
She sends out battalions

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.211
To claim it

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:42.402
And blow it apart

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.483
I grip and she grips

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.281
And faster we're sliding

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.523
Sliding and spilling

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:58.048
And what can I do?

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.521
Come back to bed, kid

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.810
Take me inside you

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.962
I promise

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:15.127
I won't lie to you

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.171
Hold on

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:22.847
Don't cry yet

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.007
I won't let you go

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:34.207
All right

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.809
The panic recedes

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.324
All right

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.246
Everyone bleeds

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.325
All right

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:56.202
I get what I need

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.760
And nobody needs

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:12.927
To know

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:22.960
Nobody needs

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:28.604
To know

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:35.727
And since I have to be
in love with someone

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:40.408
Since I need to be in love with someone

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:46.607
Maybe I could be in love with someone

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.007
Like you

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.242
Don't kiss me goodbye again

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:37.050
Leave this night clean and quiet

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.527
You want the last word

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.648
You want me to laugh

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:46.647
But leave it for now

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:51.408
All you can say
All you can feel

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:55.849
Was wrapped up inside
that one perfect kiss

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.287
Leave it at that

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:04.163
I'll watch you turn the corner and go

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.882
And goodbye until tomorrow

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.648
Goodbye until the next time you call

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:18.280
And I will be waiting

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:22.843
I will be waiting

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:29.011
Goodbye until tomorrow

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:33.848
Goodbye till I recall how to breathe

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.731
And I have been waiting

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.841
I have been waiting for you

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.803
I stand on a precipice

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.290
I struggle to keep my balance

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:01.011
I open myself

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:07.207
I open myself one stitch at a time

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:12.569
Finally yes
Finally now

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.123
Finally something takes me away

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.521
Finally free

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:25.727
Finally he can cut through these strings

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:31.201
And open my wings

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:36.042
So goodbye until tomorrow

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.609
Goodbye until my feet touch the floor

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:46.767
And I will be waiting I will be waiting

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:54.284
Goodbye until tomorrow

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:58.923
Goodbye until the rest of my life

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.208
And I have been waiting

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:07.083
I have been waiting for you

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:17.048
Waiting for you

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:28.251
I called Alise to help me pack my bags

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:33.729
I went downtown
and closed the bank account

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.289
It's not about another shrink

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:43.048
It's not about another compromise

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:53.964
I'm not the only one who's hurting here

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.330
I don't know what the hell is left to do

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:05.841
You never saw how far
the crack had opened

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.408
You never knew I had run out of rope

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:17.567
And I could never rescue you

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:23.771
All you ever wanted

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:28.926
But I could never rescue you

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:33.688
No matter how I tried

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.810
All I could do

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.964
Was love you hard

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:44.409
And let you go

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.686
No matter how I tried

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.491
All I could do

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.762
Was love you

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:15.927
God, I loved you so

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:22.887
So we could fight

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:28.524
Or we could wait

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:34.687
- Or I could go
- Goodbye until tomorrow

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:41.922
Goodbye until I crawl to your door

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.402
And I will be waiting

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.531
I will be waiting

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.601
You never noticed
how the wind had changed

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.685
Goodbye until tomorrow

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:01.127
I didn't see a way we both could win

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:06.486
Goodbye until I'm done thanking God

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.042
And I have been waiting

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.246
I have been waiting for you

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.485
Goodbye, Cathy

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.484
I have been waiting

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.409
I have been waiting for you

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.769
Goodbye

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.651
I will keep waiting

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:40.523
I will keep waiting for you

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:52.487
Just close the gate

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:59.051
I'll stand and wait

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.521
Jamie

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:07.130
- Goodbye
- Goodbye
