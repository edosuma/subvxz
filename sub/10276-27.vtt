00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.477 --> 00:12.611
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.613 --> 00:14.847
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.849 --> 00:17.616
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:19.952
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.954 --> 00:22.554
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.556 --> 00:25.457
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.459 --> 00:29.395
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.397 --> 00:33.465
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.467 --> 00:36.468
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.470 --> 00:38.137
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.139 --> 00:40.539
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.541 --> 00:42.975
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.977 --> 00:45.477
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.479 --> 00:51.617
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

00:59.593 --> 01:01.827
Clover says
spin in a circle.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.596
( giggling )
Here goes.
Whoa oh oh!

01:04.598 --> 01:06.432
Nice.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.767
Clover says hop in the air
as high as you can go.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.072
Is that really the highest
you can go? Come on!

01:13.074 --> 01:14.773
Wait. Let me
try it again.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.177
Oh. I wish I was a rabbit.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.847
- What just happened?
- Whoa, Sof!

01:21.849 --> 01:23.515
My amulet must have
done this.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.250
I wish I was
a person again.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.685
Whoa!

01:26.687 --> 01:27.853
I didn't know
you could do that.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.521
Neither did I.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.523
Ever since I helped free
Princess Elena from my amulet,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.425
it's been doing
strange things.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.626
What do you think
is going on?

01:34.628 --> 01:37.196
I'm not sure,
but I need to find out.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.232
Oh, Wormy,
my faithful raven.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.468
Look at that.
Good old Hexley Hall,

01:42.470 --> 01:44.470
where I was teamed with
the best sidekick

01:44.472 --> 01:46.405
a sorcerer could hope for.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.407
Wish I could say the same.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.442
It's missing
something,
isn't it?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.578
I know. It's missing you.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.214
I'll just add your picture
to the portrait.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.549
Entavo paintavo!

01:59.920 --> 02:01.820
Ah! That is not
what I meant to do.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.288
Of course not.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.591
Don't worry.
I'll get you out of there.

02:05.593 --> 02:09.261
Uh, Leavario paintavo?
Exitus paintavo?

02:09.263 --> 02:11.296
Mr. Cedric,
I need your help.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.931
One moment, princess.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.767
Can't you see I've got
a magical emergency on my hands?

02:15.769 --> 02:19.338
Sorry. Oh, I did
the same thing once

02:19.340 --> 02:21.673
in my enchanted
art class.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.510
Oh. Well, you don't happen
to remember the magic words

02:24.512 --> 02:26.979
to get someone
out of the painting, do you?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.981
Sure. Outo paintuvo.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.683
You are quite right.
I was only testing you,

02:31.685 --> 02:33.752
and those are, in fact,
the magic words. Well done.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.521
Outo paintuvo!

02:35.523 --> 02:37.656
There you are.
Out in a jiffy,

02:37.658 --> 02:39.458
just as I promised, Wormy.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.494
Very well. Now what's this
about needing my help?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.263
It's my amulet.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.265
It turned me into a rabbit
and then back again.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.033
It's really been acting
strange lately.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.936
Are you sure you want to
ask him for help?
( squawks )

02:50.938 --> 02:53.172
Stop your squawking,
Wormwood.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.474
The princess is trying to tell
us something extremely important

02:55.476 --> 02:57.142
about her amulet.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.478
I'm not sure if
you knew this or not,

02:59.480 --> 03:02.047
but there used to be a princess
trapped inside my amulet,

03:02.049 --> 03:05.784
and after I freed her,
it turned from purple to pink.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.020
A princess? Trapped?

03:08.022 --> 03:10.622
The amulet turned pink?

03:10.624 --> 03:13.325
- None of that is in my book.
- It was a big secret.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.160
Ever since the amulet
changed colors,

03:15.162 --> 03:16.728
it's been acting different.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.464
The powers inside it
must've changed as well.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.799
But how?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.234
There must be
a way to find out.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.970
Yes. If only we knew.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.739
Hexley Hall.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.008
We could go to
Hexley Hall.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.544
Hush, Wormwood.
I'm trying to think

03:32.546 --> 03:34.246
of someplace we can go
that would have

03:34.248 --> 03:36.215
more information
on the amulet.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.584
- Hexley Hall.
- Mr. Cedric,

03:38.586 --> 03:42.487
- what about this place?
- Hexley Hall! Of course!

03:42.489 --> 03:46.158
The school library
is filled with books
all about magical objects.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.161
One of them will surely
tell us more about your amulet.

03:49.163 --> 03:53.532
Ha ha, another brilliant idea
by Cedric the sensational.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.833
By me, you mean.

03:54.835 --> 03:55.901
Can we go right now?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.769
Right now is perfect.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.771
It's a three-day weekend,

03:59.773 --> 04:02.241
so there won't be any pesky
students to get in our way.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.609
Come, Wormy.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.844
It is time we go
back to school.

04:05.846 --> 04:09.114
We are going to learn
all the amulet's secrets,

04:09.116 --> 04:14.353
and maybe even discover how
I can finally get it for myself.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.732
Oh, Hexley Hall,
my old sorcering grounds.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.868
I learned everything I know
about magic

04:29.870 --> 04:31.603
behind these walls.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.772
All three spells.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.242
Wormwood, what is
going on between
you and Mr. Cedric?

04:37.244 --> 04:39.778
You've been complaining
about him nonstop,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.280
and it's not very nice.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.982
Because he's a nonstop
buffoon.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.118
How would you feel
if you were assigned

04:46.120 --> 04:47.886
to a bumbling fool
of a master

04:47.888 --> 04:50.122
that does nothing
but humiliate you?

04:50.124 --> 04:52.658
- I've had enough of it.
- Well, I've never heard

04:52.660 --> 04:54.826
Mr. Cedric say
one bad thing about you.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.896
Why would he?
I'm perfect.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.132
Gentlemen, if you please.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.203
Wow. Thank you.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.511
I've never seen
a school like this.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.413
It's like
Royal Prep only...

05:14.415 --> 05:17.849
Better. Much, much better.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.620
Cedric, my old friend.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.689
What a pleasant surprise.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.824
Please let me take
your coats.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.697
Can I get you
something to drink? A snack?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.498
Some popcorn, perhaps.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.267
No, thank you.

05:35.269 --> 05:37.369
Princess Sofia, this is
the headmaster

05:37.371 --> 05:39.871
of Hexley Hall,
Grimtrix the Good.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.174
And boy, is he good.

05:42.176 --> 05:47.546
Oh, Cedric, still assisting
the royals of Enchancia, I see.

05:47.548 --> 05:51.049
Now why don't you tell me
what you and the princess

05:51.051 --> 05:53.485
are doing here
on a Saturday.

05:53.487 --> 05:57.889
Well, um, Princess Sofia here
needs to consult some books

05:57.891 --> 06:00.325
for... ( stammering )...
a homework assignment

06:00.327 --> 06:01.960
for, oh, let me see.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.196
Alchemy class
at Royal Prep.

06:04.198 --> 06:08.166
He can't even tell
a silly white lie properly.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.736
Hello, Wormy.
( giggles )

06:10.738 --> 06:12.971
Still a bit
skittish, I see.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.806
Just like the old days.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.476
And I see that you're
still a weasel, Wriggley.

06:17.478 --> 06:21.680
Listen, friend, we should
celebrate your return
to Hexley Hall.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.216
Some of the old gang
still lives here
at the school,

06:24.218 --> 06:25.984
assisting professors
and such.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.220
Let's all get together
for a little reunion,

06:28.222 --> 06:30.856
grab a bite,
catch up.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.759
Why? So I can listen to
you all brag about

06:33.761 --> 06:35.761
how brilliant
your masters are?
No, thank you.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.363
That's one thing I do not
miss from our school days.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.932
Oh, come now.
It won't be like that.

06:40.934 --> 06:44.770
Besides, we can meet
in the conjeteria.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.938
That's still here?

06:46.940 --> 06:50.008
Oh, how I've missed
being able to conjure
anything I want.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.376
So it's settled then.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.845
I'll fetch you
around lunch time.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.782
Yes, I suppose I could
find the time.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.384
CEDRIC: Wormwood,
we have work to do.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.453
Can I walk you
to the library?

07:01.455 --> 07:02.854
Help you find
the books you need?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.923
No, no, I'm sure
you're very busy

07:04.925 --> 07:06.625
doing good deeds
and all that.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.860
We can find the library
ourselves.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.230
In that case,
happy reading.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.899
Finally!

07:13.901 --> 07:16.701
He's even more annoyingly
nice than I remember.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.036
Blecchhh!

07:18.038 --> 07:20.272
Well, the library
is right up the stairs.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.807
But there are no stairs.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.175
Oh, but certainly
there are.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.881
Well, are you coming
or aren't you?

07:29.883 --> 07:32.117
Oh, right.
Wait for me.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.289
Ah, the library!

07:37.291 --> 07:39.891
I studied for many
a test in here.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.660
And failed most of them.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.662
Now, what we need
to find is...

07:43.664 --> 07:45.163
Sh!

07:45.165 --> 07:47.833
Ah, yes, the shusher.
I remember you.

07:47.835 --> 07:51.069
Don't worry.
We'll keep quiet.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.406
Now, Sofia, there are
thousands of books in here.

07:54.408 --> 07:57.642
One of them must mention
the Amulet of Avalor.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.745
Take me to the books about
magical objects...

08:05.686 --> 08:09.488
Oh, it pains me
to call him my master.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.759
Look. Look what I found.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.995
A book about
the kingdom of Avalor,

08:16.997 --> 08:19.764
which has an entire chapter
on magical jewelry.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.000
Great job, Mr. Cedric.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.102
( squawks )

08:24.104 --> 08:26.271
That's the ancient
civilization of Maru.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.939
My amulet was made there.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.175
Yes, and it says here
that long ago,

08:30.177 --> 08:32.978
Maruvian sorcerers
made jewelry with

08:32.980 --> 08:35.113
special magical properties.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.816
With time and practice,
those who wear the pieces

08:37.818 --> 08:39.951
can unlock
unbelievable power.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.321
But I never did anything
to unlock my powers.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.056
Princess Elena just
gave them to me

08:45.058 --> 08:46.491
when she felt
I'd done a good deed.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.693
Ah. You mean she used to,

08:48.695 --> 08:51.329
when she was inside
your amulet.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.799
But now that she's gone,
you are in control
of the powers.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.535
Me?

08:56.537 --> 08:59.137
You gave yourself the power
to turn into a rabbit,

08:59.139 --> 09:00.505
not Princess Elena.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.507
Can I turn into any animal
I want?

09:02.509 --> 09:03.808
Let's find out.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.243
I want to be
an elephant.

09:07.481 --> 09:08.580
Try something else.

09:08.582 --> 09:11.116
- An ostrich.
- Hmm.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.286
I want to be a raven.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.756
Fascinating.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.925
It appears you must be
looking at the actual animal

09:19.927 --> 09:22.527
you wish to transform into.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.396
I can't believe this.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.933
Squawk, squawk.
( giggles )

09:27.935 --> 09:30.302
Okay. I'm ready to be
myself again.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.772
That was incredible.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.341
Yes, it certainly was.

09:36.343 --> 09:40.245
Oh, Wormy, who knows
what powers we could unlock

09:40.247 --> 09:42.681
or what we could do
with those powers.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.083
You'd probably
just bungle it.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.018
Ah, Princess Sofia.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.454
The amulet is
more powerful than ever.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.024
BOTH: Sorry.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.960
For once, I agree with
that wretched shusher.

09:54.962 --> 10:00.198
We must all keep quiet
lest anyone learn about
your amulet's powers.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.734
-I won't tell anyone.
- Good. Then let's read on.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.637
- Shhh!
- Oh, you shush.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.443
Well, Wormy,
I came to fetch you.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.946
But this is far more
entertaining.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.448
So you ready to go,

10:16.450 --> 10:18.550
or are you busy
helping your master with

10:18.552 --> 10:21.152
( chuckles )
important work?

10:21.154 --> 10:24.055
Oh, let's go.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.994
You remember
Chester and Pumpkin.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.096
Hey, Wormy's back.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.831
Birdbrain, old buddy.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.332
Really, Pumpkin?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.835
You can conjure
anything you want
in the conjeteria,

10:36.837 --> 10:39.604
and you choose
a ball of yarn.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.306
What? They're fun.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.174
You haven't changed
a bit, cranky wings.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.076
Yeah. What are
you gonna conjure

10:45.078 --> 10:47.112
if you're so good
at it, Wormwood?

10:47.114 --> 10:49.014
Well, I haven't given it
much thought.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.116
It's been a long time.

10:51.118 --> 10:55.120
I would like a large piece
of the finest peanut brittle.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.188
As you wish.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.696
I must tell you,
I really miss this place.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.197
I'm rather sick of eating
birdseed, you know.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.266
I'll take the usual.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.606
So tell us, Wormwood,

11:14.608 --> 11:17.709
what has Cedric been up to
since our school days?

11:17.711 --> 11:20.712
Oh, a little of this,
a little of that.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.715
Like doing magic tricks
at birthday parties?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.817
( guffaws )

11:25.819 --> 11:29.688
Oh, word on the street is,
your master isn't exactly

11:29.690 --> 11:32.123
the best sorcerer
in the kingdom.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.125
That's simply not true.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.628
Cedric does very important
work for the king sometimes.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.997
Occasionally.
Well, he did it once.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.132
How sad for you.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.301
Meanwhile, our masters
have been up to

11:43.303 --> 11:45.637
all sorts of great things.

11:45.639 --> 11:48.039
¶ At every winter
tournament ¶

11:48.041 --> 11:50.241
¶ My master wins first place ¶

11:50.243 --> 11:53.912
¶ Our wizards are the best,
our wizards are the best ¶

11:53.914 --> 11:56.214
¶ He's won so much,
he had to make ¶

11:56.216 --> 11:58.316
¶ A bigger trophy case ¶

11:58.318 --> 12:02.253
¶ Our wizards are the best,
our wizards are the best ¶

12:02.255 --> 12:06.024
¶ I feel such pride
when I lurk beside ¶

12:06.026 --> 12:10.428
¶ The best sorcerer
a girl could hope for ¶

12:10.430 --> 12:13.865
¶ Our wizards are the best,
our wizards are the best ¶

12:13.867 --> 12:17.268
¶ Way better than the rest ¶

12:17.270 --> 12:19.604
¶ Our wizards are the best ¶

12:26.179 --> 12:28.179
¶ His master
conjured up a spell ¶

12:28.181 --> 12:30.115
¶ For never-ending play ¶

12:30.117 --> 12:33.685
¶ Our wizards are the best,
our wizards are the best ¶

12:33.687 --> 12:36.221
¶ And his guy
just was added to ¶

12:36.223 --> 12:38.690
¶ The Wizard Hall of Fame ¶

12:38.692 --> 12:42.093
¶ Our wizards are the best,
our wizards are the best ¶

12:42.095 --> 12:45.730
¶ We feel so sad
that your guy's so bad ¶

12:45.732 --> 12:50.368
¶ The worst sorcerer
a bird could ask for ¶

12:50.370 --> 12:52.270
¶ Our wizards are the best ¶

12:52.272 --> 12:54.239
¶ Way better than the rest ¶

12:54.241 --> 12:57.742
¶ And they pass any test ¶

12:57.744 --> 13:00.211
¶ We don't say this in jest ¶

13:00.213 --> 13:02.380
¶ You oughta feel impressed ¶

13:02.382 --> 13:05.216
¶ In case you haven't guessed ¶

13:05.218 --> 13:08.052
¶ Our wizards are the best ¶

13:08.054 --> 13:10.755
You think your masters
are so great, do you?

13:10.757 --> 13:12.290
Well, I have news for you.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.560
Cedric is this close
to getting his hands on

13:15.562 --> 13:17.395
the Amulet of Avalor.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.230
One of the most powerful
objects in the world,

13:19.232 --> 13:21.399
thank you very much.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.169
And once he finally gets it
from Princess Sofia,

13:24.171 --> 13:28.439
then we'll see who has
the most powerful master.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.409
Are you telling me there's
a super powerful amulet

13:31.411 --> 13:33.311
here in Hexley Hall?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.847
Bobbin' around
that princess' neck?

13:35.849 --> 13:38.349
My master would really
like one of those.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.251
So would mine.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.955
Wait, no. I wasn't
supposed to tell you anything.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.623
Oh, but you did.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.626
Stop. Come back.
What have I done?

13:48.628 --> 13:50.795
Princess Sofia,
Princess Sofia.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.431
Thank goodness you still
have the amulet.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.034
Of course I do.
What are you talking about?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.203
I found us more books...

14:02.209 --> 14:03.508
Let me help you
with those.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.044
Ooh!

14:06.046 --> 14:07.545
Here comes the amulet.

14:09.382 --> 14:12.283
Aw. Whose cute little
pet is this?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.485
Sofia, that weasel
is dangerous.

14:14.487 --> 14:17.222
Don't be silly.
She's adorable.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.224
( giggles )
Aren't I?

14:19.226 --> 14:21.559
Oops. Careful there.
That's my necklace.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.728
Not for long, princess.

14:24.831 --> 14:27.332
- They're after your amulet.
- They're what?!

14:27.334 --> 14:29.467
Run, Sofia.
I'll hold them off.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.669
Scram. Scram, all of you.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.772
Mr. Cedric, those animals
are trying to take my amulet.

14:35.809 --> 14:38.309
What? We must get you
out of here.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.111
- Come on, Wormy.
- SOFIA: Hurry.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.217
They're just animals.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.152
How do they even know
about the Amulet of Avalor?

14:48.154 --> 14:49.787
We'll be safe in here.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.257
Where are we?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.392
This is the potion room.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.661
It holds every type
of potion ever created.

14:56.663 --> 15:00.565
Perhaps one of them will help us
elude those criminal creatures.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.301
Hmm. What is this one?

15:05.772 --> 15:08.172
Oh, no. A floating potion.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.540
Not what I was
looking for.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.377
Oh, it's all right.
I can reverse it,

15:12.379 --> 15:15.179
if I can only
reach my wand.

15:15.181 --> 15:18.516
Wormwood, why were you
worried about someone
taking my amulet

15:18.518 --> 15:20.385
before those animals
even showed up?

15:20.387 --> 15:22.754
Were you the one
who told them about it?

15:22.756 --> 15:25.556
I didn't mean to do it.
It was a mistake.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.625
Cedric makes them
all the time.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.530
Of course he makes mistakes.
Everyone does.

15:32.532 --> 15:36.100
The other animals,
they were going on and on

15:36.102 --> 15:38.269
about what a fool
Cedric is.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.438
That's what you've been
saying all day, too.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.373
Don't you see that
when someone is your friend,

15:42.375 --> 15:44.542
you accept them,
flaws and all.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.144
CEDRIC: Almost got it.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.547
Oh, no.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.651
How many indignities must
one raven suffer?

15:53.653 --> 15:56.421
Oh, it's only
a little spill, Wormy.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.157
I'll find you a towel...
( shrieks )

15:59.159 --> 16:01.292
Wait. I understood that.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.562
Wormwood, you can talk!

16:04.564 --> 16:06.130
You can understand me?!

16:06.132 --> 16:09.600
I can. This must've been
a speaking potion,

16:09.602 --> 16:11.436
which means, from now on,

16:11.438 --> 16:13.237
I'll finally be able
to understand

16:13.239 --> 16:14.739
all the lovely,
sweet things

16:14.741 --> 16:17.241
you chirp while
we're in the workshop.

16:17.243 --> 16:22.447
Yes, all those charmingly sweet
things I always say about you.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.614
I think it's great.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.483
Now that you can
understand each other,

16:25.485 --> 16:27.185
I'm sure you'll
get along even better.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.354
- Your wand.
- Got it.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.289
Oh, thank you, Wormy.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.192
This speaking potion
is already coming in handy.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.362
Oh, and so will
this floating potion.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.596
Reverse-o!

16:42.369 --> 16:44.535
Oh, perhaps I should've found
the soft landing potion

16:44.537 --> 16:46.771
before doing that.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.007
Here. I heard
some commotion.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.775
Do you need a hand
with anything?

16:50.777 --> 16:52.610
No, no, no, no.
It's nothing.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.979
We just had a little
trouble with a potion.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.447
Might I offer
some assistance?

16:56.449 --> 16:58.649
We're fine.
Thank you.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.451
Sorry for any disturbance.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.720
Maybe we should've
asked for his help.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.455
Isn't he a good sorcerer?

17:04.457 --> 17:06.557
Yes. Annoyingly so.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.826
But we cannot allow
yet another person

17:08.828 --> 17:10.628
to find out you have
the Amulet of Avalor.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.797
We must leave
Hexley Hall right away.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.132
Follow me.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.102
Quickly now.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.777
- My amulet!
- No!

17:26.880 --> 17:29.247
She has my amulet.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.150
All because you had to
go tell those animals
about it, Wormwood.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.552
What is she
talking about, Wormy?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.921
You had nothing to do
with this, did you?

17:36.923 --> 17:39.524
Well, I didn't mean
to tell them.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.491
It just slipped out.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.393
How could you?!

17:42.395 --> 17:43.895
It was a simple mistake.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.863
That was no mistake.

17:45.865 --> 17:49.534
It was part of a scheme
for you and your animal cohorts

17:49.536 --> 17:52.870
- to get the amulet
for yourselves!
- No, no, no.

17:52.872 --> 17:56.340
I can't believe you'd betray me
like this, Wormwood.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.609
After everything
we've been through.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.845
We are finished!

18:00.847 --> 18:03.781
Go find yourself
a new master.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.384
I'm so sorry.
I wish I'd never told them.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.585
I... Oh!

18:07.587 --> 18:10.354
I'm an even worse bungler
than he is.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.590
I've got to fix this.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.858
Not to worry, princess.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.560
I remember where
this leads.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.261
The wanditorium.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.963
We can find
the weasel there.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.531
Let's go.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.701
This is it.
The wanditorium.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.071
Aha! We found
that sneaky pest.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.139
Hurry!

18:29.209 --> 18:31.075
Give me my amulet back.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.578
Or we shall
take it back.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.713
Go ahead.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.981
I dare ya.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.649
Alaka...

18:40.220 --> 18:42.420
That weasel's got my wand.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.488
Can you use one of these?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.289
Oh, they're special wands

18:45.291 --> 18:46.891
that each cast
only one spell.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.392
Try this one.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.629
An ice beam wand.
Oh, let me see.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.132
Glacia externico!

18:57.670 --> 18:59.237
Trapezo webium.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.475
She's going to get away.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.810
Zappezius!

19:05.812 --> 19:08.246
Zappezius! Zappezius!

19:08.248 --> 19:09.714
Zappezius.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.654
Just try and weasel
your way past me, Wriggley.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.089
Way to go, Wormwood.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.460
A standstill wand.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.896
Stop goes the weasel!

19:26.599 --> 19:27.798
Ha ha!

19:27.800 --> 19:30.334
Got it.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.770
You know, Mr. Cedric,

19:32.772 --> 19:34.639
I never would've
gotten it back

19:34.641 --> 19:36.774
- if it wasn't for Wormwood.
- Hmm?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.442
I know he made
a mistake,

19:38.444 --> 19:40.778
but can't you give him
another chance?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.780
Remember, none of us
are perfect.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.849
Not even I, it seems.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.451
Since you put it that way,

19:47.453 --> 19:49.287
what do you say, Wormy?

19:49.289 --> 19:51.722
Shall we team up
once more?

19:53.193 --> 19:54.892
We shall indeed, sir.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.562
What is going on
in here?

19:57.564 --> 20:01.532
We didn't want to have
to tell you this, Grimtrix,

20:01.534 --> 20:05.203
but your weasel stole
Princess Sofia's amulet.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.904
Actually, that was me.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.640
I sent Wriggley
to retrieve it.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.643
You? Why would you
do such a thing?

20:12.645 --> 20:15.746
I couldn't let you leave
with that precious amulet,

20:15.748 --> 20:17.348
now could I?

20:17.350 --> 20:20.017
You knew about my amulet
this whole time?

20:20.019 --> 20:24.355
Let's just say I like to
keep an eye on my visitors.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.524
I don't understand.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.160
You did something bad?

20:29.162 --> 20:31.395
But you've always
been so good.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.031
Well, Cedric,
there comes a time

20:34.033 --> 20:36.234
when a sorcerer
grows tired

20:36.236 --> 20:39.370
of living under the rule
of kings and queens,

20:39.372 --> 20:42.607
and then he sees that
he himself should be

20:42.609 --> 20:44.609
the one to rule.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.611
I never saw a way
to make that happen

20:46.613 --> 20:51.549
until the Amulet of Avalor
practically fell into my lap.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.852
Now, hand it over.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.754
No!

20:56.756 --> 20:58.389
Mr. Cedric, help.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.691
- Stopicus...
- Shush.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.529
You of all people
should understand,
Cedric.

21:05.531 --> 21:09.734
Aren't you sick of being
a glorified jester for
King Roland?

21:09.736 --> 21:12.637
His spell is too strong.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.106
Why don't you just
give me the amulet?

21:15.108 --> 21:18.409
- Never!
- Ha ha!
Found the amulet.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.712
PUMPKIN: Looks like Grimtrix
found it first.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.849
- ( growling )
- I want to be a bulldog!

21:26.653 --> 21:28.185
What's this?

21:29.989 --> 21:32.690
Your spell doesn't feel
so strong now, Grimtrix.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.494
Take that!

21:39.999 --> 21:41.299
My crystal ball!

21:41.301 --> 21:44.001
I wish to be
myself again.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.237
Princess, look out
behind you!

21:46.239 --> 21:47.505
Now's our chance.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.875
The floating potion.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.713
Out this way.
Come on, Wormy.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.185
I hope you all learned
never to underestimate
my master again.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.753
I certainly did.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.691
Great job,
Mr. Cedric.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.758
Now let's get out of here
before Grimtrix

22:07.760 --> 22:09.360
catches up to us.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.762
Right, princess.
Here you are.

22:11.764 --> 22:15.866
Oh, Wormy, I'm glad
we're back together again.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.935
As am I.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.938
I realize now that
neither of us is perfect.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.707
But you're perfect
for each other.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.910
Yes indeed.
The perfect team.
