and how everybody
was so scared.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.066
Everybody was so --
so scared.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.002
Oh, yeah, yeah. Everyone --
They -- They were --

15:35.035 --> 15:36.303
They were scared.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.376
This is getting intense,
huh?

15:43.410 --> 15:47.414
Anthony, maybe tell us how
all of this changed your life.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.084
Well, I'm alive,
so that's good.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.952
I guess that's how
it changed my life.

16:00.093 --> 16:03.130
Monkey Fist,
Sunrise Highway.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.998
Well, thanks for
the great story.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.233
When we come back, we're gonna
be talking to --

16:06.266 --> 16:08.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
W-W-We can't cut away.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.037
He hasn't told you everything.
What about the, uh --

16:10.070 --> 16:11.438
How your mom was gonna
put you up for adoption?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.006
Oh.
She was gonna -- She was
gonna -- She was gonna --

16:13.040 --> 16:14.641
Remember that?
The story about that?

16:14.674 --> 16:16.143
The adoption part?
Monkey Fist.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.513
Really? Your mom was going to
put you up for adoption?

16:20.547 --> 16:22.182
T-Tell them about that.
It's pretty good.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.684
Oh, yeah.
She was gonna, but she didn't.

16:24.717 --> 16:25.752
She didn't.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.357
Fantastic.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.425
We'll be right back
after these messages.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.163
Guys, uh, can we get, uh,
one more segment, please?

16:36.196 --> 16:37.330
'Cause I promise you,
he's just a little nervous.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.798
I think --
-I'm sorry.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.500
We have to clear the couch
for the next guest.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.534
Next guest?

16:43.070 --> 16:44.137
[ Hushed ] No.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.139
[ Hushed ] Yes.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.180
No!

16:53.213 --> 17:01.788
Yes!

17:01.821 --> 17:02.922
What're you doing here?

17:02.955 --> 17:05.192
It's "Hero Cop Day," and I got
a great story to tell.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.261
By the way, thanks for giving me
the heads-up on all this.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.762
Really?
A kid in a wheelchair?

17:09.796 --> 17:11.231
Yeah.
I gave her my kidney.

17:17.437 --> 17:18.438
I hope that
was okay.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.406
Sweetie,
it really wasn't.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.278
Then they told me that
I really needed a kidney

17:25.312 --> 17:26.713
and we were all
so worried.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.716
And then, two weeks ago,
Mr. Munson gave me his.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.418
That's amazing, Frank.

17:31.451 --> 17:35.722
I believe that only through
giving can one truly receive.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.625
And to help with Tracy's
medical expenses,

17:38.658 --> 17:41.561
we're giving
"Team Tracy" t-shirts

17:41.594 --> 17:44.764
to anyone who donates
to Tracy's family.

17:44.797 --> 17:48.435
And on the back?
Nassau Security.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.703
That's Nassau Security.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.873
Wow! That's a great name for
a company -- Nassau Security.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.742
-[ Laughing ] Yeah!
-Right?

17:55.775 --> 17:57.410
Nassau Security just
rolls off the tongue.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.480
It's almost fun to say.
Nassau Security.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.382
[ Laughs ]
Nassau Security.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.318
-Nassau Security!
-Nassau Security! [ Laughs ]

18:05.352 --> 18:07.887
Nassau Security saved my life.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.726
That was eight.
That's impressive.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.497
Oh, man,
we're screwed.

18:17.530 --> 18:21.768
It is fun to say.
Nassau Security.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.303
Kyle,
what are you doing?

18:23.336 --> 18:27.374
Buying a t-shirt --
Team Tracy.

18:27.407 --> 18:31.211
Well, I must say, Frank,
what you've done is incredible.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.279
-Mm-hmm.
-No.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.281
What she's been through
is incredible.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.349
-Oh.
-Give me a hug, Tracy.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.787
Hey, did you see that?
What?

18:40.820 --> 18:41.888
He just bent over
to hug her.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.223
I thought he had
a kidney removed.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.158
Whatever you're thinking,
don't.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.859
Kevin! Kevin!
Don't.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.528
Please. Hey, hey,
this guy's a --

18:48.561 --> 18:49.662
You're a fraud.
You're a fraud, man.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.864
Kelly: We're in the middle
of a live broadcast.

18:51.898 --> 18:52.732
What's wrong
with you, Gable?

18:52.765 --> 18:54.167
Okay, she might've gotten
a new kidney,

18:54.201 --> 18:55.568
but I guarantee
it wasn't yours.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.337
Hey, you know what? If it
is, let me see the scar.
Let's see the scar.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.738
I don't have to
show you anything.

18:58.771 --> 18:59.772
-Exactly.
-You know what?

18:59.806 --> 19:00.907
Now's a good time to take
a commercial break.

19:00.940 --> 19:01.808
No, don't you do that, Kelly.
Come here. Let me see it.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.244
Show the scar.
Come on.
Get off me!

19:04.277 --> 19:05.845
I just had surgery,
you animal!

19:05.878 --> 19:06.779
[ Groans ]
Oh, oh.

19:06.813 --> 19:07.947
Ohh.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.716
Oh, please,
like I'm gonna fall for

19:09.749 --> 19:10.783
the ketchup on
the bandage thing?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.285
All: No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

19:12.319 --> 19:13.753
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

19:13.786 --> 19:14.621
-No, no, no, no.
-No, no, no.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.788
Ha ha ha!

19:15.822 --> 19:16.823
-No!
-No!

19:16.856 --> 19:18.425
[ All groan ]

19:18.458 --> 19:19.826
-Nope. Okay.
-No, no, no.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.561
Okay, that's real.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.731
Monkey Fist, Monkey Fist,
Monkey Fist.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.333
That's 10.

19:26.366 --> 19:37.277
Boom!

19:37.310 --> 19:38.878
I wonder what
he dreams about.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.651
Kevin: Now!

19:51.524 --> 19:54.861
