00:01.001 --> 00:03.878
To answer your question,
no, I'm not having a nervous breakdown.

00:03.962 --> 00:05.255
But thank you for your concern.

00:05.338 --> 00:07.173
Well, I wasn't concerned about you.
I was concerned about me.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.508
I mean, I'm a rip-roaring narcissist.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.051
-Yes.
-And you technically are my therapist.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.594
So you're supposed to be servicing me.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.596
-Yes.
-How could you move to a farm in Nebraska?

00:13.680 --> 00:16.891
It's more like how could I not move
to a farm in Nebraska

00:16.975 --> 00:19.769
when it looks like this. What?

00:20.353 --> 00:24.190
Come on, my husband's great aunt dies
and leaves it to him and bam!

00:24.274 --> 00:25.692
I'm living in a Pinterest page.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.110
Have you ever farmed before?

00:27.193 --> 00:29.446
I... You know... I... No.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.780
Have you ever been to Nebraska?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.240
I have not, no.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.950
But I am excited to go.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.035
-Oh, my god.
RIO: Mm?

00:35.118 --> 00:36.286
I should move to Nebraska.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.620
-Oh, I can't let you do that.
-Then we could be together.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.039
We could be best friends.
I could be your neighbor.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.623
I would advise you not to do that
just based on what I know about you.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.916
-We could bake together.
-Monique,

00:42.000 --> 00:43.043
do you remember what we talked about?

00:43.126 --> 00:44.127
The whole world doesn't revolve
around you.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.588
Don't. Don't do that. Third eye.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.214
-Okay. What's your price?
-There's no price.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.299
-It's not a number...
-Yeah. Name your number. I'll buy you out.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.508
It's not... I'm not...
And you can't "buy me out."

00:50.592 --> 00:52.010
-I want you to come live in my house.
-These are just...

00:52.093 --> 00:53.511
You got to work on boundaries.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.638
With a different therapist.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.516
Mike! I just told my last patient
that I'm leaving,

00:58.600 --> 01:01.728
and I think GPS has me getting to you
in 57 seconds...

01:01.811 --> 01:03.313
-Hey, hey!
-Whoa! Watch where you're going!

01:03.396 --> 01:04.939
-Watch my big, fat ass.
-Yeah, you wish

01:05.023 --> 01:07.275
-that ass was fat, sweetheart.
-Jerko!

01:07.358 --> 01:09.027
RIO: <i>God, the people in this city</i>

01:09.110 --> 01:10.987
<i>are driving me crazy!
I can't wait to get out.</i>

01:11.071 --> 01:12.280
-<i>Honey, I see you.</i>
-What, hon?

01:12.363 --> 01:13.615
Mike! Hey!

01:13.698 --> 01:15.450
-Hi!
-(gasps)

01:15.533 --> 01:16.910
-Hey!
-Did you quit? Did you quit?

01:16.993 --> 01:19.120
-How did it feel?
-I all the way quit.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.831
It was exhilarating.
My editor was like, "What?"

01:21.915 --> 01:24.876
And I was like, "Yeah, you heard me.
I'm going farming in Nebraska."

01:25.460 --> 01:27.670
I'm finally going to have the time
to do everything I've always wanted to do.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.632
I mean, I'm going to become the man
I've always wanted to be.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.717
A... a man who takes care of you.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.095
And makes stuff with his hands.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.179
-I'm not a New Yorker.
-Yeah.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.263
I'm a Midwesterner at heart.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.932
-I've got farming in my blood.
-You are.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.225
-You've seen me at Whole Foods.
-Yeah.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.143
I always walk straight up
to the right heirloom tomato.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.937
I know the best one. I grab it.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.814
Yes. I mean, you're from the suburbs
of Saint Louis.

01:45.897 --> 01:46.898
But I understand
what you're talking about.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.691
-Rural. Very rural.
-Yes. Very rural.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.568
Okay. Last item. It's party time.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.237
Okay!
(squeals)

01:53.113 --> 01:54.114
MAN: Move this door!

01:55.198 --> 01:58.034
(theme music)

01:58.118 --> 02:00.453
(upbeat music)

02:00.537 --> 02:04.249
You look at this sky,
and these vast plains, and...

02:04.332 --> 02:05.917
It's just... It's gorgeous, isn't it?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.418
-You know what I'm going to do?
-What?

02:07.502 --> 02:08.503
I'm going to pull this car over

02:08.586 --> 02:09.671
and we're going to frolic
in one of these fields.

02:09.754 --> 02:10.797
-No, I'm not...
-Yes.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.966
-When was the last time you frolicked?
-I am not doing that.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.427
-I'm frolicking!
-(both screaming)

02:17.512 --> 02:18.888
-Hi, Mom.
DONNA: <i>Rio...</i>

02:18.972 --> 02:21.683
whatever you do,
do not get out of that car in Iowa.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.476
A girl was murdered there in 2008.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.770
-Mom! Mom.
DONNA: <i>Her head was found in 2009.</i>

02:25.854 --> 02:28.106
-How do you know we're in Iowa right now?
-I track your phone.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.941
What, am I not going to track your phone?
I'm your mother.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.234
You track my phone, too?

02:31.317 --> 02:32.902
DONNA: <i>This is too big of a change, Rio.</i>

02:32.986 --> 02:34.863
You've never lived anywhere but the city.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.823
You don't even know how to drive.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.408
You're afraid of cows.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.701
-No, I'm not.
-You're afraid of cows?

02:39.784 --> 02:40.869
No, I'm not a... I'm not afraid of cows.

02:40.952 --> 02:44.122
You were traumatized
when you were six years old, remember?

02:44.205 --> 02:47.292
Your father took you to the petting zoo,
and the cow escaped,

02:47.375 --> 02:49.252
and then it killed itself on the freeway?

02:50.086 --> 02:51.963
-Wait, you witnessed that?
-Yeah, it was awful.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.047
Oh, my goodness.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.592
MIKE: <i>I've actually studied farming
quite a bit, Donna.</i>

02:55.675 --> 02:58.303
I wrote an article
about the DJ from Public Enemy

02:58.386 --> 03:00.430
who started a very
successful ostrich farm.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.348
(whispering)
Rio, who is this man you married?

03:02.432 --> 03:03.516
I never liked him.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.976
You don't need to waste
your time whispering, Donna.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.060
I can hear you.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.812
You've been married, what, a year?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.731
It's nothing, sweetheart, believe me.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.608
Pretty great first year.
Not a single fight.

03:11.691 --> 03:12.775
-That's right.
-So...

03:12.859 --> 03:14.485
RIO: <i>Mom, I know what I'm doing, okay?</i>

03:14.569 --> 03:16.946
<i>I'm done with New York.
I need a simpler life.</i>

03:17.030 --> 03:19.282
-No screens. Especially for this one.
-Yeah, unplugged.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.035
I'm only going to use my phone
in case of an emergency.

03:22.118 --> 03:25.788
Does your husband have a very large
and/or interesting penis

03:25.872 --> 03:29.500
that's tampering your ability
to make rational decisions?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.045
-It's both, though. It's both.
-No. No.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.254
-For the record, it's both.
-No reception.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.048
-I'll show you the next time you visit.
-All right, love you. You're breaking up.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.174
-I am not breaking...
MIKE: <i>I'd rather show you than tell you.</i>

03:36.257 --> 03:38.343
-Don't you dare hang up!
-(both screaming)

03:38.426 --> 03:40.053
MIKE: Nebraska!

03:40.136 --> 03:42.472
(both cheering)

03:42.555 --> 03:43.556
(horn honks)

03:43.640 --> 03:45.183
(imitating car sound)

03:47.810 --> 03:49.854
Okay. Uh...

03:51.105 --> 03:53.399
You know, guess it could use
a coat of paint.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.945
-Something warmer, like a...
RIO: Yep. Yep.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.822
Like a light brown, or a medium yellow.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.450
-And I think we're going to be there.
-Uh... yep.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.993
Yep.
(grunting)

04:04.077 --> 04:05.370
Not too shabby.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.289
It is a bit shabby.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.958
MIKE: Honey, I don't want you
to underestimate

04:10.041 --> 04:11.584
-the power of some sandpaper
RIO: Okay.

04:11.668 --> 04:12.669
and some elbow grease.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.295
RIO: Well...
(chuckles)

04:14.963 --> 04:17.173
Oh, that's appropriate.
(clears throat, chuckles)

04:18.508 --> 04:19.968
-My lady.
-Yeah.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.511
(grunts)

04:26.224 --> 04:27.767
MIKE: Okay.
RIO: All right.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.727
MIKE: Yeah.
-Yeah. I mean, it's, you know,

04:29.811 --> 04:31.437
-it's not so bad.
-Yeah.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.231
-This will be fine.
-Yeah.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.732
(screams)

04:34.816 --> 04:36.359
(grunts, coughs)

04:39.028 --> 04:40.029
Well...

04:40.321 --> 04:41.781
It's just the floor.

04:41.864 --> 04:44.450
RIO: (screams)
-(clattering)

04:48.746 --> 04:50.581
And also the roof.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.501
I think I just swallowed
a little bit of ceiling.

04:54.877 --> 04:58.339
You know, that afternoon light
might really be nice in the foyer

04:58.423 --> 04:59.924
if we just embrace it.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.050
Put a little...

05:02.260 --> 05:03.553
plexiglass or something over.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.721
Just keep moisture out.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.098
(ambient music)

05:09.309 --> 05:10.560
MIKE: <i>Sweetie, you don't need to worry
about the roof.</i>

05:10.643 --> 05:11.644
<i>I'm going to handle it.</i>

05:11.728 --> 05:13.354
-Yeah, I'm back to my roots now.
-Oh, you're back here. Yes, you are.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.772
I'm all man.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.566
(gasps)
Oh, my goodness, that got cold!

05:16.649 --> 05:18.276
-Okay, it's a little cold, yeah.
-Why did that just get so cold?

05:18.359 --> 05:20.987
-I guess I didn't even notice.
-I guess I overreacted.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.405
-(laughing)
-(door closes)

05:22.488 --> 05:24.407
(man coughing)

05:25.366 --> 05:26.367
(whispers)
Mike.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.619
-There's somebody in here.
-Shh.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.372
-There's somebody in our bathroom.
-So, go do something.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.750
-(clanks)
-Who is in here?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.126
MIKE: I don't know if it's an animal
or a person.

05:35.209 --> 05:36.961
-Someone is in here!
RIO: They're using the toilet!

05:37.045 --> 05:38.171
All right, get behind me.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.297
-I'll protect you.
-What are you going to do?

05:39.380 --> 05:41.090
-I'm going to protect you.
-Okay. What are you going to say?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.009
I don't know yet. All right.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.304
(both screaming)

05:48.389 --> 05:50.433
Hello. I'm Rudy.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.437
(laughs)
Rudy! It's Mike!

05:54.520 --> 05:56.105
-Man, is it so great to see you.
RIO: (chuckles)

05:56.189 --> 05:58.441
-Rudy is Aunt Maggie's neighbor.
RIO: Oh.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.276
MIKE: I haven't seen him
since I was a little kid!

06:00.360 --> 06:02.153
Lost my house a couple years ago.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.488
Maggie said I could move into the barn.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.407
But there is no plumbing out there,
so I got to use your bathroom sometimes.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.575
So, sometimes.

06:07.658 --> 06:11.454
Now, what do you, uh, do
in the rest of the times, or...

06:12.121 --> 06:13.122
Bucket.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.415
Mm-hm.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.918
Um...
(clears throat)

06:17.001 --> 06:18.336
A bucket.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.545
Um...

06:19.629 --> 06:22.006
(in slurred voice) You need to tell him
he can't use our bathroom.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.883
Honey, when you use that voice,
I do not know what you're saying.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.427
(in slurred voice)
Tell him that he can't use our bathroom.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.429
-It sounds like a goose.
-(in normal voice) No.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.764
-(garbling)
RIO: I know, but...

06:29.847 --> 06:32.016
-Then I see your mouth moving.
-(in slurred voice) You need to tell him.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.560
She's asking you to tell me
not to use the bathroom.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.187
Thank you so much, Rudy.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.398
Better fix that roof. Storm is coming.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.482
A storm?

06:39.732 --> 06:40.983
Is that right? Oh.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.111
And when is... when is the storm a-coming?

06:43.194 --> 06:44.237
Soon.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.863
Soon? Uh, so...

06:46.239 --> 06:47.240
Today, or...

06:47.323 --> 06:48.366
Soon.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.494
Got that.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.496
-Hi!
-Oh, my gosh.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.415
There's neighbor...
They must be your neighbors.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.792
There's people just, like,
walking up to just, like group

06:57.875 --> 06:59.919
-saying "hi," and to welcome us.
-Yeah.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.046
-What should I say? What should I say?
-Okay, so just start with "hi."

07:02.130 --> 07:03.214
-Okay.
-And then just kind of let it

07:03.297 --> 07:04.340
-evolve from there.
-Yeah, just, like...

07:04.424 --> 07:05.466
-She was born and raised in New York.
-Just say hi.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.844
She's never said hi to a neighbor.
This is so fantastic.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.137
-I'm so glad you're here for this.
-(knocking on door)

07:09.220 --> 07:10.263
-Come on in!
KAY: Oh!

07:10.346 --> 07:11.431
-BEAU: Hey.
-(laughing)

07:11.514 --> 07:13.433
-Hi! I'm Kay Bowman.
RIO: Hi.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.976
-Oh, hey.
-I'm Beau Bowman.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.687
-This is our son, Jacob.
-I am their son, Jacob.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.689
RIO: Yes, hey, hi.
-Hi there.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.900
Beau. Kay. Young Jacob.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.402
-Rudy.
-Rudy.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.195
Can I offer you guys something?

07:26.279 --> 07:29.657
Um, we don't have much,
but we have a little, uh, uh, biscotti,

07:29.740 --> 07:31.868
and some unsweetened ginger beer.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.121
MIKE: Hand-spun noodles. Those are...
-Also like a turmeric cracker.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.123
-The red are gluten-free, as I recall.
-So, um...

07:37.206 --> 07:39.750
There's a, uh, I think an ashwagandha.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.919
-Uh, hot drink.
-Anything jumping out at you,

07:42.003 --> 07:43.254
-that you...
RIO: So...

07:43.337 --> 07:44.380
(scoffs)

07:45.006 --> 07:48.968
No, listen, we're interested
in buying your property.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.637
We're thinking of expanding
into the slaughter industry.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.891
Yeah, we would like to use this house
as our meat locker.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.642
You know what? I think there's been
a little bit of misunderstanding.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.811
-Because we're not selling, unfortunately.
-Yes.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.771
We're going to stay
and make a go of it here.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.607
RIO: Yeah. Only a few days ago,
he was, uh...

08:02.690 --> 08:04.817
He was a music journalist
and I was a therapist,

08:04.901 --> 08:06.486
and now we're farmers.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.362
-We're going to grow alfalfa.
-Yeah.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.490
Hold up. Now, what do you mean
you're farmers?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.909
-Just all of a sudden?
-Um...

08:12.992 --> 08:14.035
-Yes. Yes.
-Should we not be?

08:14.118 --> 08:15.703
We've been doing this all our lives.

08:15.786 --> 08:18.331
You don't just announce one day
you're a farmer. I mean...

08:18.915 --> 08:20.958
-My wife's a supermodel.
-I'm Christie Brinkley.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.168
I'm an astronaut.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.337
-I'm Jacob.
-Oh, okay. All right.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.588
You guys, that farm...

08:25.671 --> 08:27.256
That farm is not going to grow anything.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.633
The soil is dead.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.510
Topsoil washed off years ago.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.678
(somber music)

08:32.762 --> 08:34.680
RIO: <i>I'm just sort of
trying to figure out, like,</i>

08:34.764 --> 08:39.268
did we just quit our job and, like,
move to a farm that doesn't grow anything?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.395
-Do you know what I mean?
-Cowgirl.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.939
-Mm?
-Are you worried?

08:43.564 --> 08:45.942
I'm... No. I'm, like, chill.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.693
-I'm just, like, processing.
-Oh. Oh, good.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.111
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Okay, good.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.696
-I'm not, like...
-You're up. You're up. You're up.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.407
Tip your hat. Tip your hat.
Tip your hat. Your hat. Tip it.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.700
MIKE: Mm-hm.
RIO: Um, um...

08:55.409 --> 08:56.744
-Sir.
MIKE: (snickers)

08:57.453 --> 08:58.538
MAN: Ma'am.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.206
-That was amazing.
-That felt amazing.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.290
-Yeah. That was good.
-That was, like, a...

09:01.374 --> 09:02.458
It's like a victory for me.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.002
So, you all must be
that couple from New York, huh?

09:05.086 --> 09:06.671
-Yes. How did you know that?
-Yeah.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.381
-The hat.
MIKE: Ah.

09:08.464 --> 09:09.507
Oh.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.051
-Hi. I'm Constance Terry.
-Oh, Connie's.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.469
-This is your store. Great.
CONSTANCE: Yeah.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.930
I'm an old friend of your Aunt Maggie's.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.682
I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.351
But she did get a little racist
near the end, you know.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.270
But, hey, ain't nobody perfect.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.397
Is there anything I can do
to make that right, or...

09:24.480 --> 09:26.148
Yeah, I don't... I think we just leave it.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.316
You know what I mean?
Because at this point...

09:27.400 --> 09:28.943
MIKE: Let sleeping dogs lie.
-Constance.

09:29.443 --> 09:30.820
Oh. Hi, Rudy.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.323
I'd like to compliment you
on the pants you're wearing.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.286
Uh... Yeah, they, uh...

09:38.869 --> 09:40.454
They're stretch denim.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.664
CONSTANCE: Uh...

09:43.624 --> 09:44.792
Made in Bangladesh.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.627
Bangla-what?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.212
Bangladesh.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.093
They have the appearance of denim.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.806
But they feel like an exercise pants.

09:58.889 --> 10:02.643
(light music)

10:02.727 --> 10:04.437
Hey, honey! How is it going?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.105
MIKE: Oh, we're good!

10:06.188 --> 10:07.565
Looking real good.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.899
Done, done, and done.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.610
Oh, awesome. So, it's fixed?

10:10.693 --> 10:12.612
There's a bit of a... a little crack
where some...

10:12.695 --> 10:13.738
Maybe some moisture will get in.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.115
-Oh.
-But with a little bit of work still,

10:16.198 --> 10:17.450
I think it's going to be great.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.369
On the roof, or there...
Is there a hole still?

10:20.870 --> 10:21.912
Well, what's a hole?

10:21.996 --> 10:23.706
Like, the classic definition of one.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.832
Yeah.

10:24.915 --> 10:25.916
Yes.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.043
Yeah.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.546
Um... I got the...
I brought this book out.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.549
So... so, what I've done here
is I pulled...

10:33.633 --> 10:34.717
Honey, I... You know, I can...

10:34.800 --> 10:36.761
-I can see that you're using your phone.
-What?

10:36.844 --> 10:38.554
There's like a couple things.
A, I can see it.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.723
B, and then your motion
was clearly scrolling.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.226
Yes, I wa... I...
I had this out just to, uh...

10:44.310 --> 10:46.395
-Photograph the pages?
-No, I... Of course.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.356
You know, just...
We have a hole in the roof still,

10:48.439 --> 10:50.691
and the storm is coming,
and the soil is dead,

10:50.775 --> 10:52.652
and, you know, I'm kind of like,
"Ah, doom."

10:52.735 --> 10:53.903
-So...
-Spinning a little bit?

10:53.986 --> 10:55.321
-I am spinning a bit, yeah.
-Okay.

10:55.404 --> 10:56.572
Listen, we're going to be fine.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.741
Well, how do you know that,
really, though?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.034
-I just know.
-Yeah.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.410
But you can't just know.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.788
-I mean, it's not possible to just...
MIKE: (chuckles)

11:03.871 --> 11:05.790
Okay, are... are we fighting?

11:05.873 --> 11:07.792
-No. We're not fighting.
-Great!

11:08.834 --> 11:10.044
-Great. That's great.
-Yeah.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.420
-That's all we need...
-Oh, yeah.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.505
-Mike!
-Watch out!

11:13.923 --> 11:16.676
Why did you... Why would you...
You broke the hammer!

11:16.759 --> 11:18.386
-Why did you break the...
-Because I'm strong, Rio!

11:18.469 --> 11:19.929
I'm stronger than I look.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.264
RIO: <i>Rudy?</i>

11:22.348 --> 11:25.142
I was wondering
if we could borrow a hammer.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.311
Yes. I will allow it.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.064
Okay.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.486
I'm sure you have questions
about what happened at the hardware store.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.863
I... In... No.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.240
Oh. Do I?

11:39.323 --> 11:40.449
With Constance?

11:41.325 --> 11:43.244
We have a lot of sexual chemistry.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.328
Enough said.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.455
I didn't... I didn't notice that.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.540
You're a therapist, right?

11:47.623 --> 11:48.749
I was a therapist.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.418
Um, but now I'm a farmer.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.421
Is there something
that you want to talk about, or...

11:53.504 --> 11:55.923
I don't need therapy.
I'm not a Jewish person.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.883
Oh, no, no. You don't have to be Jewish
to go to therapy.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.552
Yeah. Okay.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.471
No, I'm serious. You actually...
You don't have to be Jewish.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.057
My friend keeps having a dream
about his ex-wife.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.351
Makes it hard for him
to sleep in the barn.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.645
-And your friend also sleeps in the barn?
-Sleeps in the barn, yes.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.813
Got it. Right.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.440
His name is Bun.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.400
-Bun.
-His wife left him.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.986
But now he's having feelings
for another woman.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.740
But in the dream,
his ex-wife has really sharp teeth,

12:20.823 --> 12:22.491
and she's dressed like Big Bird,

12:22.575 --> 12:23.576
and she keeps yelling,

12:23.659 --> 12:26.245
"I know what you did, Rudy!
I know what you did!"

12:28.164 --> 12:29.749
She calls Bun by the name "Rudy."

12:29.832 --> 12:30.875
Yes.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.294
Bun isn't a real person.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.379
Okay. That's okay.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.464
I think what's going on

12:36.547 --> 12:38.799
is that you're having feelings
for someone new,

12:38.883 --> 12:41.927
and that means you're letting go
of your ex-wife.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.181
Do you think
that's what actually scares you?

12:46.098 --> 12:48.559
(light music)

12:48.642 --> 12:51.395
You're good. That's... Wow.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.230
-(chuckles)
-(horn honks)

12:54.940 --> 12:56.817
-Hi, neighbor.
-Hey, Mr. Mike!

12:56.901 --> 12:58.903
-Just saying hi.
-How are you doing, guys?

12:58.986 --> 13:00.654
I'm a... I'm a little busy right now,
if you don't mind.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.948
Yeah, we heard you're having some trouble
with your roof.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.242
Jacob can help.
He's got a real feel for wood.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.410
-I love wood.
-Yeah.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.204
He tried to eat it
when he was a little boy,

13:08.287 --> 13:10.164
and I started calling him Beaver,
until Beau told me...

13:10.247 --> 13:11.248
I told her to stop.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.292
KAY: Well...
-Who's a beaver? Oh, I got a hammer.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.710
Okay. Back in business.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.795
Yep.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.797
-I think you're doing it wrong.
MIKE: Sit down. Sit.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.174
Thanks for the help, but I got it covered.
(screams in pain)

13:20.257 --> 13:22.593
You know, that storm looks
to be pretty bad.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.553
Price will go down
if the house gets wrecked.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.013
MIKE: Oh! Hammer!
-Oh, is that right?

13:26.096 --> 13:28.307
Well, um... I am curious, actually.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.434
What... How much is it
that you're offering?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.269
-Hello. Rio. Rio.
RIO: Anyway, I would be just curious.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.479
You know, I was just curious.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.358
-Are you trying to sell the farm?
-No, I was just curious,

13:37.441 --> 13:39.860
because I was just... Let's...
Can we go talk somewhere?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.779
No, I'm right in the middle
of fixing the roof.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.781
-Yes, roof.
-Okay? And if we go talk,

13:43.864 --> 13:45.407
-I can't fix the roof.
-Roof, but...

13:45.491 --> 13:48.452
No, what I was going to say was that
maybe we should just, you know,

13:48.536 --> 13:51.372
both agree that, like,
not a lot of progress has been made...

13:51.455 --> 13:52.706
I see a lot of progress.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.167
There's a surfboard up there
that I think you brought.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.962
Do you not believe in me?
Is that what's...

14:00.214 --> 14:01.382
Okay, you know what?

14:01.465 --> 14:02.967
-I'm going to take a five-minute walk.
RIO: No.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.677
-Cool off. Just to get some air...
-Mike, I...

14:04.760 --> 14:06.178
-in the system and, uh...
-No.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.472
-Excuse me. No, no. Mike, please.
-You know, breathe a bit.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.432
I just need to be alone for a minute, hon.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.809
I would like to be alone.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.936
Can we be alone together?

14:14.436 --> 14:16.230
You think he's ever held a hammer before?

14:16.313 --> 14:19.400
-Not in his hand, no.
-(both laugh)

14:19.483 --> 14:21.277
-Stop it, Beau.
-(laughing continues)

14:22.862 --> 14:26.282
Honestly, what's really important is that,
you know, Mike and I got into,

14:26.365 --> 14:28.117
-like, a real argument, you know?
DONNA: <i>Mike is fine.</i>

14:28.200 --> 14:29.910
-I understand but Mike is fine.
RIO: <i>But the thing is</i>

14:30.035 --> 14:31.245
-I have to get some more of the...
DONNA: <i>What I want to know is,</i>

14:31.328 --> 14:32.454
<i>-what kind of storm is it, sweetheart?</i>
-(gasps)

14:32.538 --> 14:34.623
<i>Is it a tornado? If it's a tornado,
that's very, very dangerous.</i>

14:34.707 --> 14:35.749
-Oh, no, Mom.
<i>-You need to get</i>

14:35.833 --> 14:37.126
<i>the hell out of there right away.</i>

14:37.209 --> 14:39.253
-Oh, Mom.
<i>-What? What? What?</i>

14:39.336 --> 14:40.379
It's happening.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.964
Wha... wha... What's happening?
What's happening?

14:42.548 --> 14:43.966
DONNA: <i>What's happening, Rio?</i>

14:44.508 --> 14:45.926
-Cow.
-<i>Oh, my god!</i>

14:46.010 --> 14:47.469
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

14:48.596 --> 14:51.390
(car approaching)

14:52.558 --> 14:54.768
-(car door opens)
CONSTANCE: Woop woop!

14:55.394 --> 14:57.396
-If I was you, I would get...
MIKE: It's not on.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.731
-What?
-It's not on.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.107
-Is it on now?
MIKE: No.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.567
CONSTANCE:
I think the battery may be going.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.068
-(beeps)
-Is it on now?

15:03.152 --> 15:05.154
-Yep.
-Woop woop!

15:05.988 --> 15:08.824
If I was you,
I would get off of this private property

15:08.908 --> 15:12.202
unless you want a BB gun
pointed at your ass. Over.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.121
Constance, why are you in a cop car?

15:14.204 --> 15:15.789
Because I'm the sheriff, too.

15:15.873 --> 15:20.127
And I run the local theater
and we just did a production of <i>Les Mis.</i>

15:20.210 --> 15:22.796
And I played a French ho.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.175
You know, I came out here
to get a little alone time,

15:26.258 --> 15:27.843
if that's not too offensive to you.

15:27.927 --> 15:28.928
Too bad.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.012
Because I want to know

15:30.095 --> 15:31.889
why you're walking along this road
by yourself.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.350
(cow moos)

15:34.433 --> 15:37.061
Rio, get big. Get big and scary.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.395
-Okay.
DONNA: <i>But with a happy face.</i>

15:38.479 --> 15:40.230
<i>But with your eyes shut. No eye contact!</i>

15:40.314 --> 15:42.399
<i>Very large, and moo.</i>

15:42.483 --> 15:44.860
(grunting)

15:44.944 --> 15:46.070
<i>-Show them who is the boss.</i>
-(growls)

15:46.153 --> 15:48.113
I'm the boss. I'm the boss.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.491
Very good, Rio.
Go with what you've learned.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.576
You know. You know what this is all about.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.953
-Yeah.
DONNA: <i>This is about</i>

15:54.036 --> 15:56.705
<i>your father and his abandonment
of all of us.</i>

15:56.789 --> 15:58.374
I'm a child of divorce, all right?

15:58.457 --> 15:59.792
I'm from New York, you know?

15:59.875 --> 16:01.460
I don't want any trouble. I really don't.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.045
-Oh, it's moving its head.
-(cow moos)

16:03.128 --> 16:04.588
Put the cow on the phone, Rio!

16:04.672 --> 16:06.298
Put the cow on the phone right now!

16:06.382 --> 16:07.716
DONNA: <i>Let me tell him a thing or two.</i>

16:07.800 --> 16:09.051
Can you talk to my mom, please?

16:09.134 --> 16:13.389
<i>Get your hands off of my daughter,
you big, fat, bovine beast!</i>

16:13.472 --> 16:15.516
-(loud moo)
-Aah! Oh, my god! It's attacking me!

16:15.683 --> 16:17.101
It's attacking me! Holy...

16:17.184 --> 16:19.144
Rio and I got in a fight,
and we've never fought.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.521
You all never fought?

16:20.604 --> 16:21.647
How long you been married?

16:21.730 --> 16:23.148
-A year.
-A year?

16:23.232 --> 16:25.067
That ain't a marriage. That's a long date.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.111
You still in the part
where you're pretending to be

16:27.194 --> 16:28.821
what the other person wants you to be.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.699
You know, my husband, we fought.
We fought...

16:31.782 --> 16:33.784
We fought a lot before he passed away.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.285
But you got to fight.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.620
(sighs)
Fighting is good.

16:36.704 --> 16:40.207
Fighting is when two people
care enough to get ugly.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.418
Everything can't be good all the time.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.546
You know, the best kind of love
ain't happy.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.924
The best kind of love is honest.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.511
-Best kind of love is honest.
CONSTANCE: Mm-hm.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.179
(light music)

16:55.347 --> 16:56.640
Rio!

16:56.724 --> 16:58.934
Rio, we got to batten down the hatches.
Storm's here!

16:59.018 --> 17:01.103
Hey, Mike, how was your alone time?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.730
MIKE: Hon? Where... where are you?

17:02.813 --> 17:05.149
-I'm up here!
-Oh, what are you doing up there?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.109
You know, I'm just...

17:07.818 --> 17:10.487
I ran up on the roof
to get away from a cow.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.655
Yeah, that makes sense.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.116
Baby, you got to come down.
The storm is here.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.118
-Um, yes, I... I would love that.
-(thunder rumbles)

17:16.201 --> 17:20.039
I just... I'm experiencing
what I would diagnose as a panic attack.

17:20.122 --> 17:23.167
Okay. Say no more. I'm coming up.
I'll get you down in a jiff.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.085
-I'm stuck, Mike!
-All right, I'm coming!

17:25.169 --> 17:28.005
It's a very sneaky, aggressive cow, Mike.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.757
It's okay, honey. I'm here.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.467
-You're not stuck. You're not stuck.
-Hi!

17:31.550 --> 17:32.718
I'm going to guide you
to the ladder, okay?

17:32.801 --> 17:33.802
-You're not stuck.
-I'm not stuck. I'm not...

17:33.886 --> 17:35.012
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.305
-Okay.
RIO: (grunts)

17:36.680 --> 17:38.724
MIKE: Oh.
-(clanks)

17:44.396 --> 17:47.900
-This just in. We are stuck.
-(thunder rumbles)

17:49.485 --> 17:52.071
-(thunderclap)
-I have to pee!

17:52.154 --> 17:53.155
Yeah.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.531
Me, too.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.326
Why did you leave me alone?

17:57.409 --> 17:59.244
Why did you try to sell
the farm to the Bowmans?

17:59.328 --> 18:01.705
Oh, I don't know, Mike!
Because maybe look at it.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.665
-Are we fighting?
-I think so, yeah.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.959
-Good. Good. We need to fight, okay?
-Yeah.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.087
You have not chilled out
since we got here!

18:08.170 --> 18:11.215
Because I really wanted to be this, like,

18:11.715 --> 18:15.052
cool, chill, brave kind of girl,

18:15.135 --> 18:17.012
you know, when we got to the farm,
but the truth is I'm not.

18:17.596 --> 18:22.226
That's not me. And I currently do not know
what to do with my life,

18:22.309 --> 18:23.894
and that really scares me.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.188
Okay, well, that's okay.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.648
-And there's another thing.
-(thunderclap)

18:27.981 --> 18:29.274
I love my phone.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.359
-I love it.
-(thunder roars)

18:30.442 --> 18:33.821
I have not unplugged,
and I have no intention of unplugging!

18:33.904 --> 18:34.988
Yeah, no doi.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.824
I want you to know

18:36.907 --> 18:39.034
that I want to be the man
that can fix a roof.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.286
I do. But... but I don't think I am.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.371
-Roof.
-Roof.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.914
Roof. It's roof.
I'm pretty sure it's roof.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.541
-We're saying the same word.
-No, we're not.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.543
-It's fine.
-And while I'm being honest,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.337
hon, I didn't... I didn't quit my job.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.923
The... the magazine folded,
and I got laid off,

18:53.006 --> 18:55.175
-and I didn't know how to tell you.
-What?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.844
I was afraid you would think
I was a failure,

18:56.927 --> 18:58.971
and then the farm
just kind of fell in my lap,

18:59.054 --> 19:01.265
so it all happened really quickly, and...

19:02.683 --> 19:05.269
(light music)

19:05.853 --> 19:07.646
Just... Can you... Can you say something?

19:07.729 --> 19:09.606
Even if it's in that
annoying whisper voice?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.733
-(thunderclaps)
-Oh, my god.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.026
Sweetie.

19:13.110 --> 19:17.948
I'm... I'm so sorry I drug us out
to this terrible farm.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.908
It's not how I remembered it,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.494
and this whole thing was a mistake,
and I'm sorry.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.079
No.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.039
It's not a mistake.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.501
I... It's what I love about you, Mike.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.171
You make my life an adventure.
You really do.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.881
You make me feel brave.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.801
Honestly, the thing
that scares me the most

19:37.885 --> 19:39.595
would be my life without you.

19:40.679 --> 19:46.768
(calm music)

19:47.561 --> 19:48.562
RIO: <i>Hey, honey.</i>

19:49.396 --> 19:50.898
I just want you to know that I...

19:50.981 --> 19:52.941
I peed a long time ago,

19:53.025 --> 19:55.360
and it was quick, but it happened.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.779
Oh, good. I... I peed, too.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.823
And it was not quick.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.286
(horn honking)

20:04.995 --> 20:06.872
MIKE: What the hell?
RIO: Oh.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.540
-What?
MIKE: What, it's like an armada.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.918
(laughing)

20:11.001 --> 20:12.085
MIKE: Oh.
CONSTANCE: Hey!

20:12.711 --> 20:15.297
We got a call at the station
from someone named Donna?

20:15.380 --> 20:17.758
She said her daughter is in danger.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.593
Thank you guys so much.

20:19.676 --> 20:20.677
Thank you!

20:20.761 --> 20:23.013
Hey, this is just what we do, okay?

20:23.096 --> 20:25.140
CONSTANCE:
Everybody, come on. Let's get them down.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.433
All right, don't you fall.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.268
Come on, let's go, everybody.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.895
(indistinct shouting)

20:29.978 --> 20:31.605
(upbeat music)

20:31.688 --> 20:33.899
Come on, missy. Let me warm you up.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.275
-Oh, Constance, thank you so much.
MIKE: Oh.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.568
-Yeah, I got to take this off.
-Great.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.195
-Mike?
-Hey, Rio.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.696
-Hi!
BEAU: We just want to say

20:39.780 --> 20:41.365
we're still interested in making a deal.

20:41.448 --> 20:44.159
Yeah, like I always tell Jacob,
it's okay to give up.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.119
Thank you so much.
We're going to stay, so...

20:46.203 --> 20:48.330
How wonderful for our community. Right?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.916
Were you just saying that
to get rid of them,

20:50.999 --> 20:52.376
-or do you mean it?
-No, I mean it.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.794
-You mean it?
-Yeah.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.212
Okay.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.637
(gasps)
Mike!

21:05.055 --> 21:06.306
Alfalfa!

21:06.765 --> 21:08.475
(laughing)
Alfalfa!

21:08.558 --> 21:09.643
You've grown an Alfalfa.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.270
-That's it! That's it!
-The soil is not dead!

21:11.353 --> 21:13.480
When should we tell them it's a weed?

21:14.439 --> 21:15.482
Soon.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.610
-(laughs)
-(screaming)

21:18.694 --> 21:20.445
RIO: Oh, the soil is not dead!
MIKE: We did it!

21:20.529 --> 21:23.865
MIKE: <i>♪ We're growing alfalfa
Growing alfalfa, all right ♪</i>
