00:04.705 --> 00:07.075
( theme music playing )

01:51.245 --> 01:53.814
( calliope music playing )

02:38.526 --> 02:40.628
NO.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.430
SOFIE.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.832
I'M SORRY,
I THOUGHT I SAW
SOMEONE COME IN HERE.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.201
NO.
NO, JUST YOU AND ME.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.371
I WONDER, MY DEAR,

03:23.471 --> 03:27.741
IF YOU WOULD MIND TERRIBLY
DOING ME A FAVOR?

03:29.777 --> 03:32.413
WHAT?

03:34.782 --> 03:37.818
THERE'S A LOOSE THREAD
ON THE BACK OF MY COLLAR.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.822
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.469
DO YOU SEE IT?

03:56.103 --> 03:58.005
NO.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.277
( inhales )

04:13.621 --> 04:15.356
CAREFUL.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.834
THERE.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.636
THANK YOU.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.904
YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:34.342 --> 04:37.044
WHAT WOULD I DO
WITHOUT YOU?

04:40.013 --> 04:42.483
- SOFIE?
- YES?

04:44.585 --> 04:47.488
YOU REALLY
SHOULD'VE KNOCKED.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.761
- I HAD HIM DEAD TO RIGHTS!
- THERE WAS HALF A DOZEN GOONS

04:53.861 --> 04:56.430
- WOULD HAVE CAUGHT HIM
ON THE PORCH.
- I HAD HIM!

04:56.530 --> 04:58.999
LISTEN, KID,
IT AIN'T JUST THE PREACHER.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.068
IT'S A WHOLE BUNCH
OF THEM.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.203
AND NOT JUST THE ONES
TOTING SHOTGUNS.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.506
YOU KILL HIM,
THEY'RE LIKELY TO GO APE.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.742
- THAT AIN'T MY PROBLEM.
- IT IS IF THEY SET ON YOU.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.779
AND THEY WILL,
LIKE A PACK OF HUNGRY DOGS.

05:11.879 --> 05:15.483
I DON'T CARE!
AS LONG AS HE'S DEAD.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.685
( scoffs )

05:17.785 --> 05:19.953
WHAT THE HELL IS IT
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

05:20.053 --> 05:22.990
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.892
MANAGEMENT, YOU,

05:24.992 --> 05:27.361
JESUS, JOHN THE BAPTIST--
THE WHOLE BUNCHA YOU!

05:27.461 --> 05:30.464
ALL FIRED UP
TO THROW YOUR LIVES AWAY.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.601
THEY DID WHAT
THEY HAD TO DO.

05:33.701 --> 05:34.902
HOGWASH.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.137
YOU THINK THE LORD HAD
TO DIE TO MAKE HIS POINT?

05:37.237 --> 05:40.641
WHAT IF WHEN
THEY SAID, "COME ON DOWN
FROM THAT CROSS,"

05:40.741 --> 05:43.644
OLD SUS JUST COME ON DOWN
AND SPIT RIGHT IN THEIR EYE?

05:43.744 --> 05:45.379
WHAT HARM
WOULD THAT HAVE DONE?

05:45.479 --> 05:48.281
THAT'S ABOUT
THE DUMBEST THING
I EVER HEARD.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.783
NO, IT AIN'T!

05:49.883 --> 05:52.352
THE DUMBEST THING IS
DYING WHEN YOU AIN'T GOTTA.

05:52.453 --> 05:56.356
DYING JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE
PISS-POOR AT LIVING.

05:56.457 --> 05:59.793
- THAT AIN'T TRUE!
- IT IS TRUE AND YOU KNOW IT.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.262
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S TRUE--

06:02.362 --> 06:05.232
WHEN IT COMES TO LIVING,

06:05.332 --> 06:08.502
DYING IS THE EASY PART.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.846
WHAT ABOUT SOFIE?

06:18.946 --> 06:22.382
- WHAT ABOUT HER?
- EVEN IF YOU DID
MANAGE TO KILL HIM,

06:22.483 --> 06:24.051
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
WOULD HAPPEN THEN?

06:24.151 --> 06:26.554
THEY'D SET ON YOU
AND SHE'D BE IN
THE THICK OF IT,

06:26.654 --> 06:28.155
- TRYIN' TO STOP THEM.
- YOU AIN'T SEEN HER.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.559
SHE'S ALL FULL UP
AND GOO-GOO EYED
WITH THE LORD.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.127
- SHE'S STILL ONE OF US.
- NO, SHE AIN'T!

06:34.227 --> 06:36.063
SHE'S LIVING
IN HIS HOUSE.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.998
SHE WAS BAPTIZED
BY THE SUMBITCH.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.433
HE CALLED HER HIS TREASURE!

06:39.533 --> 06:41.535
HIS GODDAMN TREASURE!

06:41.635 --> 06:43.637
WELL, I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE CALLED HER.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.973
I KNOWED THAT GIRL
SINCE SHE WAS
KNEE-HIGH,

06:46.073 --> 06:47.908
AND I KNOW
WHAT SHE'D DO.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.644
AND IT AIN'T STANDING BY,
WATCHING WHILE ONE OF
HER OWN GETS KILLED.

06:50.744 --> 06:55.048
NOT WITHOUT
DYING HERSELF
TO STOP IT.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.754
HE'S RIGHT, KID.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.324
COME ON.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.394
- WHAT ABOUT HIS BRACE?
- NO NEED FOR THAT.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.731
THEY ALREADY KNOW.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.188
A LOT OF US...

07:36.590 --> 07:39.159
WE WAS WRONG
ABOUT YOU.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.163
AFTER WHAT YOU DID
FOR JONES...

07:45.398 --> 07:48.201
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY,
BEN HAWKINS.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.987
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
JUSTICE TO YOU?

08:07.087 --> 08:10.023
WHY DON'T YOU DRY UP?

08:17.097 --> 08:19.066
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.702
HE'S OUT THERE
WITH THEM, ISN'T HE?
WITH THE CARNIVAL.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.270
- HE'S ONE OF THEM.
- WHO?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.072
THE BOY-- BEN,

08:25.172 --> 08:26.540
YOUR FRIEND.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.408
I DIDN'T SAY
HE WAS MY FRIEND.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.144
SOMETHING MORE, PERHAPS?

08:32.345 --> 08:35.816
I SAID I KNEW HIM.
THAT'S ALL.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.886
YOU WERE WITH THEM TOO,
WEREN'T YOU?

08:40.153 --> 08:42.222
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.825
NOT ANYMORE.

08:44.925 --> 08:48.361
WHY DO YOU CONTINUE
TO DECEIVE YOURSELF?

08:48.461 --> 08:52.700
CAN YOU NOT SEE
THAT YOU ARE A PRISONER
OF YOUR PAST?

08:52.800 --> 08:56.169
ONLY I CAN SET YOU FREE
FROM THIS BONDAGE.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.639
IT IS TIME
TO CHOOSE, SOFIE.

08:58.739 --> 09:02.042
YOU MUST CHOOSE...

09:02.142 --> 09:04.311
THEM OR ME.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.052
TELL ME!

09:15.055 --> 09:17.658
GO TO HELL.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.732
GO? WHY?

09:24.832 --> 09:28.669
I PLAN ON
BRINGING IT HERE.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.742
Samson:
THINK ABOUT IT, KID.

09:34.842 --> 09:38.612
A MILLION RUBES
FOLLOWING THAT CLOWN--

09:38.712 --> 09:43.851
ON WHAT?
A BUNCH OF PRETTY WORDS.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.453
MEANWHILE,
YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.

09:46.553 --> 09:49.623
THEY GET A GANDER
AT WHAT YOU CAN DO,

09:49.723 --> 09:52.760
THEY'LL FLOCK TO YOU,
JUST LIKE IN TIPTON.

09:52.860 --> 09:56.229
- A HEALING TENT.
- DAMN RIGHT!

09:56.329 --> 09:58.231
"BENJAMIN ST. JOHN"!

09:58.331 --> 10:03.771
BEAT THAT BLACK-HEARTED
BASTARD AT HIS OWN GAME.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.373
SHOW THEM ROLLERS
WHAT'S WHAT.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.877
AND YOU WANNA DO THAT
WITH A BUNCH OF
FAKE HEALINGS?

10:09.977 --> 10:13.380
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT FAKE?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.517
I CAN'T DO THAT.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.953
YES, YOU CAN.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.690
I'VE SEEN WHAT YOU DONE.
NOT JUST WITH JONESY,

10:22.790 --> 10:24.958
THAT KID AFTER
THE FERRIS WHEEL
COLLAPSED.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.829
- YOU'VE SEEN HOW IT WORKED?
- I SEEN HE WAS DEADER
THAN DILLINGER,

10:28.929 --> 10:31.364
HIS MAMA BEGGING
FOR HIS LIFE.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.534
AND YOU JUST...
LOOKED AT HIM,

10:34.634 --> 10:36.704
AND HE COME BACK.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.638
THAT AIN'T WHAT YOU SAW.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.974
THE HELL IT AIN'T.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.211
I TOOK THAT WOMAN'S LIFE.
I GAVE IT TO HER SON.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.080
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?

10:47.180 --> 10:49.282
IT MAKES ALL
THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE WORLD.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.652
I CAN'T JUST CONJURE UP
A HEALING FROM SCRATCH.
IT DON'T WORK THAT WAY.

10:52.753 --> 10:56.056
ALL I DO IS MOVE LIFE.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.159
MOVE IT FROM ONE BODY
TO ANOTHER.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.896
SO...

11:04.564 --> 11:06.700
YOU HEAL SOMEONE...

11:06.800 --> 11:09.770
I GOTTA HURT
SOMEONE ELSE.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.381
WELCOME ABOARD--

11:21.481 --> 11:23.450
BROTHER JUSTIN.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.722
JONESY LOCKS HIM IN,

11:28.822 --> 11:32.025
FIRES HER UP
AND SPINS HIM AROUND.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.362
MEANWHILE,
YOU COMMENCE TO HEALING.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.066
YOU DO TO THAT PREACHER
JUST WHAT YOU DONE
TO THAT WOMAN.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.734
TAP HIM DRY.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.569
HE'S TRAPPED IN THERE.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.838
GOT NO PLACE TO GO.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.007
POOR
BROTHER JUSTIN.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.743
MUST HAVE HAD
A BAD TICKER OR SOMETHING.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.746
NOT A MARK ON HIM.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.614
NATURAL CAUSES.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.884
OH, THEY'LL BE
WEEPING AND WAILING,

11:56.984 --> 12:00.053
POUNDING THEIR CHESTS
AND WHATNOT.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.856
ONE THING THEY WON'T
BE DOING IS BLAMING US.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.425
WE PACK IT UP,
SHAKE DUST,

12:05.525 --> 12:07.861
PRETTY AS YOU PLEASE.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.898
THAT MIGHT WORK.

12:10.998 --> 12:13.967
KID, IT'S PERFECTION.

12:14.802 --> 12:17.805
THERE'S STILL SOFIE.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.773
Samson:
WE'LL FIND HER.
YOU CAN MARK IT.

12:19.873 --> 12:23.176
THIS SETUP IS NEAT
AS A BANDBOX.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.645
AGREED?

12:25.745 --> 12:29.582
WHAT IF THE PREACHER
DON'T WANT A RIDE?

12:29.682 --> 12:33.220
YOU LEAVE
THAT ONE TO ME, KID.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.791
( brakes squeal )

12:41.761 --> 12:44.131
( Sofie grunting )

13:00.814 --> 13:02.249
( Stroud grunts )

13:02.349 --> 13:05.118
WOULD YOU STOP
SQUIRMING, WOMAN?

13:07.354 --> 13:09.156
SHUT UP!

13:11.791 --> 13:14.094
( lock clicks )

13:16.696 --> 13:19.099
( Apollonia cackling )

13:27.174 --> 13:29.076
MAMA?

13:33.881 --> 13:36.850
GET TO WORK, YOU VAGRANT.

13:43.857 --> 13:47.160
- THERE YOU ARE.
- Libby: HERE I AM.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.729
I WAS LOOKING ALL OVER
FOR YOU.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.299
Libby:
HUH.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.839
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:59.940 --> 14:03.343
- NOTHING.
- LIB.

14:09.249 --> 14:14.454
- I CAN'T.
- CAN'T WHAT?

14:14.554 --> 14:17.457
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T KEEP BEING
THIS WAY.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.959
WHAT WAY?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.928
NO, I'M NOT GONNA
TALK ABOUT IT.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.696
IT'S JUST GONNA GO BAD
AND THAT'S AT BEST.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.399
SO JUST QUIT
PICKING AT ME.

14:29.569 --> 14:34.908
- THIS IS ABOUT
SOFIE, AIN'T IT?
- OH, GOD DAMN IT!

14:36.876 --> 14:38.511
( chuckling )

14:38.611 --> 14:39.980
WHAT THE HELL
IS SO FUNNY?

14:40.080 --> 14:42.615
NOTHING.
IT'S JUST...

14:43.816 --> 14:45.518
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I EVER GUESSED

14:45.618 --> 14:47.454
WHAT'S ON A WOMAN'S MIND
AND GOT IT RIGHT.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.757
- WELL, I'M GLAD YOU GOT ME
ALL FIGURED OUT.
- I DO!

14:50.857 --> 14:54.594
I DO, AND THAT'S
A GREAT THING!

14:54.694 --> 14:56.363
THAT I'M BORING?

14:56.463 --> 15:01.768
NO! THAT I ALWAYS KNOW
WHERE I STAND WITH YOU.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.836
AND YOU...

15:03.937 --> 15:05.973
YOU AIN'T BORING.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.707
( chuckling )

15:07.807 --> 15:09.276
YOU'RE A LOT OF THINGS,

15:09.376 --> 15:12.312
BUT BORING
AIN'T ONE OF THEM.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.354
ARE YOU STILL
SWEET ON HER?

15:21.454 --> 15:23.423
NOPE.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.663
- DO YOU LOVE ME?
- YES, I DO.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.301
WELL, YOU BETTER.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.237
NORMAN...

16:10.337 --> 16:14.441
WHAT IF YOU HADN'T
FOUND US THAT NIGHT
OUT ON THE ROAD?

16:16.109 --> 16:19.546
DO YOU THINK THINGS
WOULD BE DIFFERENT NOW?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.981
( mumbling )

16:24.951 --> 16:28.455
I THOUGHT I WAS
IN SERVICE TO GOD.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.093
I THOUGHT WE WERE
CHILDREN OF GOD.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.403
I WISH I HAD MADE
BETTER DECISIONS.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.808
BUT THEY'RE ALL MINE.

16:48.908 --> 16:52.712
THE CHILDREN
AND ELEANOR...

16:55.182 --> 16:57.484
SINS LE THAT.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.454
BLACK SINS.

17:01.554 --> 17:05.058
THOSE ARE BEYOND
REDEMPTION, YOU KNOW?

17:26.045 --> 17:29.082
WHEN I DIE,
I'M GOING TO HELL.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.353
AND IF I AM VERY,
VERY FORTUNATE...

17:33.453 --> 17:37.424
MY BROTHER WILL BE
WAITING FOR ME
WITH AN EMBRACE.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.427
( knocks at door )

17:41.961 --> 17:44.197
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.906
Samson:
GOOD DAY, MISS IRIS.

17:54.006 --> 17:57.210
WE COME ABOUT
THE HONORARIUM.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.847
OF COURSE.
WON'T YOU COME IN?

18:07.220 --> 18:08.755
Iris:
NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.523
- HOWDY, MA'AM.
- HELLO.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.553
POOR BASTARD.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.591
HERE WE ARE.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.527
$250, THE AMOUNT
WE AGREED UPON.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.995
THANK YOU, MA'AM.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.264
NO, THANK YOU.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW EXCITED EVERYONE--

18:51.364 --> 18:56.135
- IRIS?
- Iris: OH, JUSTIN.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.105
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT WE HAD GUESTS.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.073
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HOME.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.942
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE
FROM THE CARNIVAL.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.611
ARE THEY?

19:04.711 --> 19:09.382
WE WAS
JUST THANKING YOUR SISTER
FOR HER GENEROSITY.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.785
- YES INDEED.
- IT'S FOR THE CHILDREN.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.455
OF COURSE.

19:17.724 --> 19:22.529
I MUST SAY, IT IS AN HONOR
TO FINALLY MEET YOU,
REVEREND.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.596
THANK YOU.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.532
WE'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO YOU ON THE RADIO.

19:25.632 --> 19:29.836
AND I DON'T MIND SAYING,
YOU'VE BEEN A INSPIRATION
TO THE LOT OF US.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.738
YOU KNOW, IN A WAY,

19:31.838 --> 19:36.943
- YOU AND ME ARE
IN THE SAME BUSINESS.
- IS THAT A FACT, MISTER--?

19:37.043 --> 19:39.612
SAMSON'S THE NAME.
YES, SIR, IT IS.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.949
BROTHER VARLYN.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.252
WE HAVE VISITORS.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.586
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.923
I BELIEVE WE'VE
MET ON THE ROAD.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.096
YOU REMEMBER SABINA...

19:57.196 --> 19:59.232
FROM THE DAILY BROTHERS'
CIRCUS?

19:59.332 --> 20:01.501
RECENTLY DEFUNCT.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.637
AW, REALLY?
THAT'S TOO BAD.
I RATHER ENJOYED THEM.

20:04.737 --> 20:08.408
Justin:
MY GOODNESS.
YOU KNOW EACH OTHER.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.310
WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.946
- SMALL WORLD.
- YES.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.982
GETTING SMALLER
ALL THE TIME.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.784
IN FACT,

20:17.884 --> 20:21.854
WE HAVE A MAID
THAT YOU MIGHT BE
ACQUAINTED WITH.

20:21.954 --> 20:25.658
A LOVELY GIRL.
NAMED SOFIE.

20:30.463 --> 20:34.166
IT DOESN'T RING A BELL.

20:34.267 --> 20:37.236
WELL... I, UH,
HATE TO RUN,

20:37.337 --> 20:41.274
BUT WE'VE GOT A SHOW
TO PUT ON.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.743
MUCH OBLIGED, MA'AM.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.514
OH.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.149
- GOODBYE.
- Iris: GOODBYE.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.018
THANK YOU.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.157
Samson:
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.692
ROLLO?

20:59.792 --> 21:02.495
TWO FREE TICKETS
TO RIDE COLOSSUS,

21:02.595 --> 21:07.834
THE BIGGEST AND BEST TRAVELING
FERRIS WHEEL ON ANY CIRCUIT
WEST OF THE PECOS.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.703
REVEREND,
WE'D BE HONORED

21:10.803 --> 21:13.039
IF YOU AND MISS IRIS
WOULD GIVE IT A WHIRL.

21:13.139 --> 21:17.544
- I COULDN'T POSSIBLY--
- Justin: OH, COME NOW, IRIS.
IT'S JUST A CHILD'S RIDE.

21:17.644 --> 21:21.581
MY SISTER HAS A DREAD FEAR
OF HEIGHTS.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.484
- OF COURSE, I WOULD--
- ROLLO.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.923
MY APOLOGIES, MISS IRIS.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.393
I DID NOT MEAN TO UPSET YOU.

21:33.493 --> 21:37.063
GOOD DAY, REVEREND.

21:46.172 --> 21:49.409
SAMSON, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

21:49.509 --> 21:51.878
HE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE
THEM TICKETS.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.081
WELL, I JUST MADE SURE
HE INSISTS ON 'EM.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.549
AND HOW IS THAT?

21:56.649 --> 21:59.419
SNIPS AND SNAILS, MY DEAR.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.403
Ben:
HE KNOWS THAT SHE'S
ONE OF US?

22:16.503 --> 22:20.106
HE PRETTY MUCH
HUNG A BANNER
ON IT.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.812
OH, SHIT.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.882
AND YOU DIDN'T SEE HER
AT THE HOUSE?

22:29.982 --> 22:32.685
MAYBE SHE WAS RUNNING ERRANDS,
COME BACK AFTER Y'ALL LEFT.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.721
NAW, I PUT OSGOOD UP
TO WATCH THE ROAD.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.490
- SHE AIN'T BEEN UP THERE.
- IF SHE'S IN THAT DAMN
HOOVERVILLE

22:37.590 --> 22:39.492
SHE'S A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK,
YOU DO KNOW THAT?

22:39.592 --> 22:41.961
JEEZ, JONES.
IT AIN'T MY FAULT!

22:42.061 --> 22:44.864
- Jones: I AIN'T SAYING IT WAS!
- SHUT UP, THE BOTH OF YA.
I'M TRYING TO THINK.

22:44.964 --> 22:48.501
HE'S PROBABLY GOT
HER STASHED AWAY SOMEPLACE,

22:48.601 --> 22:51.170
PLAYING HER
LIKE A HOLE CARD.

22:51.270 --> 22:55.508
IT WON'T WORK, THOUGH.
SUMBITCH WILL BE DEAD
BEFORE HE GETS TO PLAY IT.

22:55.608 --> 22:59.011
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

23:01.180 --> 23:02.582
FORGET ABOUT HER.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.517
- WHAT?
- THE HELL!

23:04.617 --> 23:06.719
FOR NOW!
WE JUST FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH THE PLAN.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.589
ONCE THE SHOUTING IS OVER,
THEN WE TRACK HER DOWN,

23:09.689 --> 23:12.191
BRING HER BACK IN,
SCRAPE GRAVEL.

23:12.291 --> 23:16.028
- I DON'T LIKE IT.
- YOU THINK I DO?

23:20.066 --> 23:22.769
WHAT IF SHE'S DEAD?

23:29.609 --> 23:32.545
IF SHE'S DEAD...

23:32.645 --> 23:35.648
THEN GOD HELP THEM ALL
IN THIS VALLEY.

23:37.617 --> 23:40.186
EVERY SINGLE
LAST ONE OF 'EM.

23:45.458 --> 23:48.227
- ( banging )
- ( Sofie panting )

23:48.327 --> 23:50.563

24:37.644 --> 24:39.812
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

24:39.912 --> 24:43.349
I TOLD YOU

25:03.369 --> 25:05.037
EVERY PROPHET

25:07.707 --> 25:09.876
EVERY PROPHET
IN HER HOUSE.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.510
( grunting )

25:11.611 --> 25:13.813
I CAN'T BE HER.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.149
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.086
( screams )
STOP!

25:20.186 --> 25:22.622
( sobbing )

25:35.902 --> 25:36.703
MAMA.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.138

NO!

26:09.568 --> 26:11.738

26:17.443 --> 26:21.814
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.953
( Sofie screaming )

26:31.523 --> 26:35.294
- ( children yelling )
- ( carnival music playing )

27:03.222 --> 27:05.391
EVENING.

27:10.663 --> 27:13.032
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.939
WE GOTTA TAKE CARE

27:20.039 --> 27:22.374
CAN'T VERY WELL LEAVE
THE BOY HIGH AND DRY

27:22.474 --> 27:25.044
AFTER WHAT HE DONE
FOR JONES.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.183
STILL...

27:31.283 --> 27:35.788
FELIX WANTED US
TO PUT ON LONG-JOHNS
UNDER OUR COSTUMES,

27:35.888 --> 27:37.389
CALL IT
"THE DANCE OF SALOME,"

27:37.489 --> 27:40.893
- OR SOME SUCH
BIBLICAL HORSESHIT.
- ( laughing )

27:46.699 --> 27:48.935
HE'S JUST SCARED.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.772
I AM TOO.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.095
WHAT'S THIS?

28:16.195 --> 28:17.596
THAT'S THE NUT.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.366
250 BUCKS.

I CAN'T TAKE IT.

28:25.471 --> 28:29.308
WEOT TO TAKE CARE
OF OUR OWN.

28:48.027 --> 28:51.130
( footsteps approaching )

28:51.230 --> 28:52.564
I DON'T LIKE IT.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.633
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?
AN EVENING OF GAMES
AND FRIVOLITY

28:54.733 --> 28:57.904
- WILL DO US ALL
A WORLD OF GOOD.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.006

29:00.106 --> 29:02.241
STAY HERE.
LET ME AND THE BOYS GO DOWN

MY BROTHER.

29:22.862 --> 29:27.133
YOU WHO HAVE SUFFERED

29:28.400 --> 29:30.236
YOU ARE MY ROD...

29:30.336 --> 29:33.072
AND MY STAFF.

29:34.306 --> 29:37.043
YOU MUST HAVE FAITH.

29:55.327 --> 29:59.031
PAIN IS AN UNAVOIDABLE
SIDE EFFECT.

30:35.334 --> 30:40.539
Sofie's voice:
THE PEOPLE IN THESE TOWNS,
THEY'RE ASLEEP.

30:40.639 --> 30:42.808
ALL DAY, AT WORK,
AT HOME,

30:42.909 --> 30:44.977
THEY'RE SLEEPWALKERS.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.213
WE WAKE THEM UP.

30:47.914 --> 30:50.216
WE WAKE THEM UP.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.960
Barker:
COME ONE, COME ALL.

31:01.060 --> 31:05.664
STEP RIGHT UP,
STEP RIGHT UP.

31:05.764 --> 31:08.800
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS,
STEP RIGHT UP, STEP RIGHT UP.

31:08.901 --> 31:14.173
INSIDE AND ONSTAGE,
10 CAN BE SEEN FOR
THE PRICE OF ONE.

31:14.273 --> 31:17.576
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS,
COME ON UP...

31:29.922 --> 31:33.359
REVEREND, I'M SO PLEASED
THAT YOU COULD COME DOWN

31:33.459 --> 31:35.227
WE ARE SO GLAD
THAT YOU AND YOUR TROUPE

31:35.327 --> 31:37.396
HAVE BROUGHT SUCH JOY
TO THE FAITHFUL BRETHREN.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.999
BEING THAT THERE'S SO MANY
WOMEN AND CHILDREN PRESENT,

31:40.099 --> 31:41.934
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOUR MEN WOULD MIND

31:42.034 --> 31:44.070
LEAVING THE WEAPONS
IN THE VEHICLES.

31:44.170 --> 31:48.674
SORRY, MICROBE, NO CAN DO.
WE'VE ALREADY HAD ONE ATTEMPT
ON THE REVEREND'S LIFE.

31:48.774 --> 31:53.912
I READ IN THE PAPERS IT WAS
THIS CODGER IN THE WHEELCHAIR
TOOK A SHOT AT HIM.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.848
YOU AIN'T

ARE YOU, FELLA?

31:56.949 --> 31:59.685
Iris:
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
JUSTIN...

31:59.785 --> 32:02.421
HE'S RIGHT.
GUNS SHOULD NOT BE
AMONG THE CHILDREN.

32:02.521 --> 32:06.158
- FORGET IT.
- NO, NO. MY SISTER IS
QUITE RIGHT, VARLYN.

32:06.258 --> 32:10.029
PLEASE ASK YOUR MEN
TO LEAVE THEIR WEAPONS
IN THE TRUCKS.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.400
YOU HEARD THE REVEREND.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.040
GOOD?

32:21.140 --> 32:23.609
WELL, NOW THAT THAT'S SETTLED,

AND THE MANY FEARS
THAT THEY HAVE FACED
AND OVERCOME

32:39.992 --> 32:41.994
