-You know,
you don't need the discs.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.340
You can just download these.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.967
Uh, what do you want
to watch next?

09:52.009 --> 09:54.720
Uh, <i>Translucent

09:54.761 --> 09:57.389
<i>Queen Maeve Pleasure Slave.</i>

09:59.433 --> 10:01.393
Oh. <i>Starlight Pulls an A-Train.</i>

10:01.435 --> 10:03.645
I'm good. I'm good.
Thank you.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.522
Okay.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.274
Different strokes, man.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.067
Please don't say that
in this context.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.028
<i>I should just get up and leave.</i>

10:11.069 --> 10:14.114
<i>But you like watching
Homebanger fuck me, don't you?</i>

10:14.156 --> 10:15.782
You know,
this isn't healthy, man.

10:15.824 --> 10:19.036
Y-You can't watch porn
while the... sun's out.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.246
Look, if I get up at
that hearing, I'm dead anyway.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.748
What difference does it make?

10:22.789 --> 10:25.542
<i>-(woman moaning)

Did you know I was a prodigy?

10:42.059 --> 10:44.770
A fucking prodigy.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.897
I lit my first fire at four.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.149
Burned my whole house down.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.568
My dad--

10:51.610 --> 10:53.612
he was so proud.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.989
"My son's a Supe."

10:58.700 --> 11:01.203
I was gonna do great things.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.080
I almost did.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.123
Now look at me.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.626
I'm like the cuck in the porn,

11:07.667 --> 11:09.628
sitting on the sidelines

11:09.669 --> 11:12.339
while the real heroes are
out there doing the fucking.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.470
You want to know
why they left me to babysit you?

Never mind.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.321
After... she was gone,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.824
I watched my dad do...

11:38.865 --> 11:41.243
nothing his whole life.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.412
But me--

11:43.453 --> 11:45.664
I thought I'd finally found...

11:45.705 --> 11:47.124
something.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.210
I thought I found
what I was meant to do.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.588
But it turns out I'm...

11:53.630 --> 11:56.133
shit at that as well.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.760
You're not the cuck.

I'm... the cuck.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.683
Actually, you're worse.

No one condones
the tragic shooting

12:35.172 --> 12:36.423
at the convenience store.

Our thoughts and prayers
go out

to Kuldeep Singh's family.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.886
And we are making a donation

12:40.927 --> 12:42.679
to Samaritan's Embrace

12:42.721 --> 12:44.181
Absolutely.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.849
Thoughts and prayers.

But...

12:47.642 --> 12:49.686
that doesn't change facts.

Right before these godless,

pouring across our borders

-(laughs)
-And then punish us

13:16.963 --> 13:18.924
-for trying to stop them.
-That's right.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.407
It brings me no pleasure
to tell you this,

a mole in The Seven.

Leeds,

Old Trafford.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.175
You loved it.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.428
Do you know why I loved it?

'Cause you'd get on the piss

17:41.186 --> 17:42.437

to say goodbye to Lenny.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.069
And I don't want that with you.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.530

It's a shit world out there.

You count on no one
but yourself.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.374
You either sink or you swim,

18:03.416 --> 18:05.043
and, in Lenny's case,

18:05.084 --> 18:06.795
he chose to sink.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.422
You don't have the fucking right

18:09.464 --> 18:11.049
to mention his name.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.469
I fucking loved Lenny.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.888
But he wasn't hard like you.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.848
That's why you're still here
and he's dead, isn't it?

18:18.890 --> 18:21.893
You beat the fucking shit out
of the both of us, didn't you?

18:21.935 --> 18:24.020
Maybe I pushed you a bit hard.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.189
But look at you.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.941
-Get the fuck off...
-You afraid of anything?

18:27.982 --> 18:29.526
No.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.611
Are you the strongest bastard
you know?

18:31.653 --> 18:33.655
Yeah.

18:35.907 --> 18:38.243
Tougher than I ever was.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.790
Oh, you're welcome, asshole.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.295
(quietly):
Yeah.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.923
Lenny stuck that gun
in his mouth

18:51.965 --> 18:54.133
when you couldn't hack it
anymore

18:54.175 --> 18:58.221
and you pissed off to join
the SAS like a right cunt.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.139
You're the one
who abandoned him,

19:00.181 --> 19:01.933
not me.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.314

19:08.356 --> 19:09.691

-(chuckles)

19:19.868 --> 19:22.328
See?

19:22.370 --> 19:24.831
Lenny could never have
done that.

-Christ. Billy.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.754
Jesus.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.427
-(indistinct chatter)
-All right, guys.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.387
-Sorry, we gotta go.
-All right, guys.
Thanks very much.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.306
-Take care, God bless.
-God bless.
-(cheering)

19:41.347 --> 19:42.599
I'm telling you--
it's a mistake.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.600
What is?

19:43.641 --> 19:45.810
Keeping fucking Starlight alive.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.354
Hey. Yeah.

19:51.566 --> 19:52.984
I underestimated her before.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.569
I will not do it again.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.988
"Starlight is a traitor"
is trending number one.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.324
And we've got a million tweets
in support of Compound V.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.242
A common enemy
rallies the base.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.036
Just trust me.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.871
All right.

20:04.913 --> 20:08.082
And if I can get my hands
on Hugh Campbell,

20:08.124 --> 20:10.209
maybe pull his little spine out
the back of his fucking neck...

20:12.712 --> 20:13.922
You okay?

20:13.963 --> 20:15.757
Yeah, I just, um...

20:15.798 --> 20:17.884
HOMELANDER:
Your daughter?

20:17.926 --> 20:20.887
Yeah.
(chuckles softly)

20:20.929 --> 20:25.016
80 years ago,
she looked exactly like that.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.644
Sometimes it feels
like yesterday.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.611
I got something
I want to show you.

20:39.322 --> 20:40.907
What to finish up the backyard?

20:40.949 --> 20:44.452
Okay if I put
this person right there?

20:46.663 --> 20:48.790
Hey, guys.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.124
Hello.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.376
This is Stormfront.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.836
Stormfront, this is Rebecca.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.465
Very nice to meet you.

20:57.507 --> 21:00.134
And this is my son.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.136
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

21:03.805 --> 21:05.932
Listen, um...

21:05.974 --> 21:07.767
I know, last time, uh,

21:07.809 --> 21:10.436
I screwed up big-time,
and, um...

21:10.478 --> 21:12.689
and I just want you to know
I'm never, ever

21:12.730 --> 21:14.440
gonna push you
that hard again, okay?

21:16.734 --> 21:18.695
All right, well, Ryan,

21:18.736 --> 21:21.739
I'd love you to meet
my girlfriend, Stormfront.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.658
Wow, he looks just like you.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.076
HOMELANDER:
You think?

21:25.118 --> 21:27.078
STORMFRONT:
Are you serious? Those eyes?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.371
-(chuckles softly)
-Hey, Ryan,

21:28.413 --> 21:30.289
your daddy told me
all about you.

21:30.331 --> 21:33.543
-You have superpowers, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

21:33.584 --> 21:36.838
That makes you
very, very special.

21:36.879 --> 21:41.926
You are the first natural-born
superhero.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.679
Can we not?

21:44.721 --> 21:46.389
That's right. Um...

21:46.431 --> 21:47.974
Ryan does have powers,

21:48.016 --> 21:51.185
but his mom doesn't like
to talk about them or use them.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.354
Can you also let me know
before you just pop by?

21:53.396 --> 21:54.772
STORMFRONT:
He's Ryan's father.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.024
He has a right to see his son.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.109
Uh, that's very true,
but, look,

21:58.151 --> 21:59.944
we all just have
Ryan's best interests at heart.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.362
-Right?
-Yes, we do.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.656
I'm really sorry
I haven't been here enough.

22:03.698 --> 22:06.993
Ryan, uh, I'd really like you
to get to know Stormfront.

22:07.035 --> 22:09.203
I would. She's someone
I care about very much,

22:09.245 --> 22:10.413
and, um...

22:10.455 --> 22:11.831
I think you will, too.

22:11.873 --> 22:14.083
So, I think, uh,

22:14.125 --> 22:15.501
we'll be around more.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.545
A lot more.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.340
I want us to be a family.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.677
<i>(door opens)</i>

22:26.554 --> 22:28.514
-Hey.
-(keys jangle)

22:28.556 --> 22:31.100
Empire Wok.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.727
Hi.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.107
That was a fraught "hi."

22:40.234 --> 22:42.361
I'm going to my sister's
for a while.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.576
I have a plan.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.536
You don't need to be scared
of Homelander.

22:50.578 --> 22:51.996
That little girl...

22:52.038 --> 22:54.040
on the plane.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.878
What she must have gone through
in those last few moments.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.922
I lie awake every night
thinking about that.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.132
-Me, too.
-But then I start snowballing

23:03.174 --> 23:04.675
and wondering... (sniffles)
...how many other people

23:04.717 --> 23:06.177
have you killed
and what else have you done?

23:06.219 --> 23:08.387
-I didn't have a choice.
-I'm not blaming you.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.848
I'm not.
It is not your fault.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.643
Will you just--
Will you s-- will you sit down?

23:13.684 --> 23:15.603
-And it's not fair.
-Will you sit down?

23:15.645 --> 23:18.940
I wish I were as strong as you.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.650
But I'm not.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.611
I just need time.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.990
(panting)

23:33.246 --> 23:36.374
Over and over, you...
(sniffles)

23:37.667 --> 23:40.294
You said
you wanted to see the real me.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.383
This is the real me.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.969
I know. (sobs)

23:48.010 --> 23:50.388
I'm sorry.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.807
(sighs)

23:52.849 --> 23:55.101
(sniffles)

24:00.439 --> 24:02.316
(beeps)

24:02.358 --> 24:04.068
<i>WOMAN:
Yes?</i>

24:04.110 --> 24:05.945
I'm here to see Jonah.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.573
<i>He's not taking any visitors.</i>

24:10.116 --> 24:12.285
Tell him it's Grace Mallory.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.797
Goddamn.

24:24.839 --> 24:27.717
We're on the wrong team.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.887
VOGELBAUM:
Moral compromise does have
its privileges.

24:30.928 --> 24:31.888
Grace.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.973
I thought you retired.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.391
Dr. Vogelbaum.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.642
I thought you were taller.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.561
(laughs)

24:38.603 --> 24:40.897
Sonia, can you get some tea?

24:40.938 --> 24:42.982
Thank you, but we won't be
staying long enough.

24:43.024 --> 24:46.944
Ah, yes, there's
that WASPy patrician tone.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.739
-All business.
-Doc, what do you know
about the Sage Grove Center?

24:49.780 --> 24:51.157
Never heard of it.
Should I have?

24:51.199 --> 24:53.576
Considering Vought's been doing
illegal tests there

24:53.618 --> 24:54.994
since you were the CSO

24:55.036 --> 24:56.746
and they're still doing 'em
to this day,

24:56.787 --> 24:58.623
-seems like you should've.
-That's horrible.

24:58.664 --> 25:01.918
Maybe it was Sonnenshine's
project over in R & D.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.128
Prick always did have
a real god complex.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.088
MALLORY:
Do you recall the deal we made?

25:06.130 --> 25:08.132
In exchange
for me graciously dropping

25:08.174 --> 25:10.551
certain involuntary manslaughter
charges?

25:10.593 --> 25:12.220
I recall it was a long time ago.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.764
Doesn't expire until
the statute of limitations does.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.807
Then I guess
I'm turning myself in.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.267
(scoffs)

25:18.309 --> 25:20.686
We don't have
to do this dance anymore, Jonah.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.063
(exhales)

25:22.104 --> 25:23.481
We're both out.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.316
Just a couple of retirees

25:25.358 --> 25:27.485
shooting the shit
on the back nine.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.570
We both know Vought fucked you.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.989
Probably put you in that chair.

25:33.491 --> 25:34.951
Help us fuck 'em back.

25:34.992 --> 25:37.411
Testify to Congress.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.583
That's my daughter.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.710
She took time off
from her practice

25:44.752 --> 25:46.963
to help a bitter old invalid.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.214
I'm sorry to say this, Grace,

25:48.256 --> 25:49.632
but you're the very last person

25:49.674 --> 25:51.717
who should be asking me
for help.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.177
After what you lost.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.598
Do what you like to me.

25:57.640 --> 26:01.644
But some things are more
important than the right thing.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.272
(door closes)

26:04.313 --> 26:05.940
MALLORY:
He's right, of course.

26:05.982 --> 26:08.359
You should listen to him.

26:08.401 --> 26:09.777
Ma'am?

26:09.819 --> 26:11.612
Go back to your wife
and daughter.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.948
Nah. I'd just be putting them
in more danger.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.700
(laughs):
Ah, yes,

26:15.741 --> 26:18.703
the self-martyring bullshit
of the special ops soldier.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.289
I'll get you all on a flight
to Nicaragua.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.082
No one sees you again.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.752
When this is done,
I'll take you up on that.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.088
But that's the point, Marvin.
It's never done.

26:29.130 --> 26:31.090
You just let go.

26:31.132 --> 26:32.758
No justice for your father.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.010
No revenge against Vought.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.761
You get nothing,

26:35.803 --> 26:37.555
except your family.

26:37.596 --> 26:41.058
Go and never come back.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.728
I wish I had.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.477
-They need you two.
-Yeah.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.604
Still got a few deal points
to talk through,

30:13.646 --> 30:16.941
but let's just say, they should
be getting your rooms ready.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.609
-For real?
-Honey, this is amazing.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.236
-Wow.
-Thank you. Thank you so much.

30:20.277 --> 30:21.987
-You're welcome.
-This is awesome.
-(laughs)

30:22.029 --> 30:25.658
By the way, what do you guys
think of, um, Eagle the Archer?

30:25.699 --> 30:27.076
Oh, he's like a brother to me.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.411
Yeah, he was there for me
when I was at rock bottom.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.288
He's the most kind,
loving person that you ever...

30:31.330 --> 30:34.416
He's a toxic personality,
and no Church members are

30:34.458 --> 30:37.336
to have any contact with him
whatsoever.

30:37.378 --> 30:39.505
Right. Yeah.

30:39.547 --> 30:42.591
No, now that you mention it,
he did seem pretty toxic. Yeah.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.385
Wh-What did he do?

30:44.426 --> 30:47.680
Well, he claims
the program had failed him.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.807
But actually
he failed the program.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.475
-He doesn't exist,
you understand?
-Of course.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.562
Ah. Oh, come on.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.146

gonna do the limbo.

lesbian couple, after all.

32:25.861 --> 32:29.073

33:09.154 --> 33:11.031

33:11.073 --> 33:12.783
Tony here is your quarterback.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.201
You protect his blind side.

33:14.243 --> 33:17.121
Okay? When you look at him,
you think of me.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.540

33:35.723 --> 33:37.933

Yeah.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.563

33:42.604 --> 33:44.314
PewDiePie?

33:44.356 --> 33:46.692
What's that?

33:46.734 --> 33:49.778
Or, uh, what about one

33:49.820 --> 33:51.405
You're in a movie?

33:51.447 --> 33:54.116

I'm in a bunch of movies, man.

33:54.158 --> 33:56.452

34:02.374 --> 34:04.668
-in <i>Homelander: Brightest Night.
</i>-Thank you.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.545
RYAN:
Mom, can I see them?

34:06.587 --> 34:08.589
When you're old enough,
we can talk about it, okay?

34:08.630 --> 34:10.257
Ah, they're PG.
He can see them now.

34:10.299 --> 34:11.341
You're old enough.

34:11.383 --> 34:12.926
You're absolutely old enough.

34:12.968 --> 34:15.721
For sleepovers
and baseball games

34:15.763 --> 34:18.348
-and visits to Vought Land.
-Yeah.

34:18.390 --> 34:21.268
Did you know that your dad has

34:21.310 --> 34:22.936
-his own roller coaster?
-Mm-hmm.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.396
Do you want to take a ride

34:24.438 --> 34:25.773
-on your dad's roller coaster?
-Can I, Mom?

34:25.814 --> 34:26.857
We can talk about it.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.358
Whenever you want.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.861
(Homelander laughs quietly)

34:30.903 --> 34:33.405
-I need to speak with you.
-Eh, we're having
a good time here, right?

34:33.447 --> 34:34.448
Outside.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.075
Now.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.123
That's a great idea.

34:43.165 --> 34:46.043
You two... stay here,
get to know each other better.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.252
RYAN:
Okay.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.840
I'll show you,
um, <i>Dances with Wolves.</i>

34:51.882 --> 34:54.134
-I know what you're doing.
-Nope, you don't.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.261
-Yes, I do. I-I can see...
-No, you do not.

34:56.303 --> 34:59.765
You could not
possibly understand.

34:59.807 --> 35:01.767
I was raised
the same way as him.

35:01.809 --> 35:04.728
That kid doesn't know
anything about anything.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.689
When he sees the outside world,
he's going to panic.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.400
Now, that's gonna fuck him up.

35:10.442 --> 35:14.238
I do not want my son to have to
go through what I went through.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.367
His life...

35:18.408 --> 35:20.410
-is different.
-(sighs)

35:20.452 --> 35:22.830
He has a mother.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.332
And I know that that means
something to you. I do.

35:25.374 --> 35:27.668
And if you take him
away from me, this...

35:27.709 --> 35:29.336
this whole world
will feel so confusing

35:29.378 --> 35:31.880
-and frightening.
-Yes, but, Rebecca,

35:31.922 --> 35:35.008
you... are lying to him.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.386
Because I love him.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.638
And I know a part of you
loves him, too,

35:39.680 --> 35:41.431
and that you want
what's best for him.

35:41.473 --> 35:46.019
But what's best for him is to be
here with me, with his mother.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.313
Look, we have this opportunity

35:48.355 --> 35:51.149
to give him a-a childhood
you never had.

35:51.191 --> 35:53.360
We can do that
if he's here with me.

35:55.028 --> 35:57.656
(voice breaking):
Please. I'm begging you, please.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.164
you or Grace came for, either.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.468
What was he like?

36:59.509 --> 37:00.802
Who?

37:00.844 --> 37:02.554
Homelander.

37:02.596 --> 37:05.015
Growing up as a lad,
what was he like?

37:06.224 --> 37:07.643
(exhales)

37:07.684 --> 37:09.478
I'm sure you don't want
to talk about this...

37:09.519 --> 37:12.981
Oh, there is nothing
I want to talk about more.

37:13.023 --> 37:16.568
And who knows better than you?

37:17.611 --> 37:18.946
(sighs)

37:18.987 --> 37:21.406
When he was a little boy,
five or six,

37:21.448 --> 37:23.075
he was quite sweet.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.620
He'd cuddle up to me.

37:26.662 --> 37:29.873
He loved stories
about Davy Crockett,

37:29.915 --> 37:31.833
Teddy Roosevelt.

37:31.875 --> 37:35.504
Loved the idea of the woods,
the forest,

37:35.545 --> 37:38.382
manifest destiny.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.342
Well, you know,
I needed him to be

37:40.384 --> 37:42.803
the strongest man in the world.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.597
So I went to work on him.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.599
He didn't even want it.

37:50.060 --> 37:52.062
It was for me.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.901
Hmm.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.654
And that wasn't your only sin.

38:02.531 --> 38:04.324
Was it?

38:06.284 --> 38:10.372
It wasn't Homelander who hid
my wife away all them years.

38:14.126 --> 38:18.338

sorry bastards like me?

38:19.548 --> 38:22.509
At the time, it was barely
a blip on my radar.

38:26.138 --> 38:29.599
Tell me, Doctor,

38:29.641 --> 38:33.020

telling you now?

42:31.675 --> 42:34.928

45:01.241 --> 45:03.493
Aren't you that sweaty young man
from Believe?

45:03.535 --> 45:04.828
Hi, Mrs. January.

45:04.869 --> 45:06.830
Is that a human hand?

45:06.871 --> 45:10.875
Yes, it is.
Come on. We got to go. (grunts)

45:10.917 --> 45:12.877
(groaning softly)

45:18.633 --> 45:20.051
Hughie?

45:21.553 --> 45:24.639
DONNA (gasps):
Annie! Annie! Annie!

45:24.681 --> 45:26.474
-Oh, my God! Oh!
-Annie!

45:27.517 --> 45:28.476
Hmm.

45:28.518 --> 45:30.562
-Oh!
-(both panting)

45:32.230 --> 45:33.982
Hey.

45:34.023 --> 45:36.901
Wh-What are you doing here?

45:46.953 --> 45:48.913
How are we gonna
get out of here?

45:49.956 --> 45:51.166
I know a way.

45:53.585 --> 45:55.587
(oven beeps)

45:58.673 --> 46:01.885
All right, dinner's ready!

46:01.926 --> 46:03.928
(quietly):
Assholes. (grunts)

46:03.970 --> 46:07.098
Hey, bud.
You ready for dinner?

46:09.934 --> 46:11.728
What's wrong?

46:13.771 --> 46:15.190
You're a liar.

46:15.231 --> 46:17.358
-You lied to me.
-What do you mean?

46:17.400 --> 46:19.569
They just flew me up and
showed me! This house is fake?

46:19.611 --> 46:21.321
The neighbors are fake?
You're fake?

46:21.362 --> 46:23.156
Boy deserves to know the truth.

46:24.407 --> 46:25.950
Hey. Listen to me.

46:25.992 --> 46:27.243
We can talk about this, okay?

46:27.285 --> 46:28.661
I know that you must
feel confused,

46:28.703 --> 46:30.413
and there are reasons
for what I did. I'm sorry.

46:30.455 --> 46:32.081
No, just don't touch me!
I hate you!

46:33.333 --> 46:35.919
I think he just needs
a little space.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.172
-Come here, son.
-No. No.

46:39.214 --> 46:41.925
All right, he needs his mother.

46:41.966 --> 46:43.968
Don't worry.
He'll still have a mother.

46:45.595 --> 46:48.014
Hey, Ryan. Ryan!

46:48.056 --> 46:49.724
Hey, Ryan, no!

46:49.766 --> 46:51.017
Ryan! No!

46:53.978 --> 46:57.941
(crying):
Oh, my God. No. Please.

46:57.982 --> 47:01.694
MOTHER'S MILK:
Kid, you are
fucking unbelievable.

47:01.736 --> 47:03.613
All you had to do
was watch porn.

47:03.655 --> 47:05.490
I didn't know he was gonna
set himself on fire.

47:05.532 --> 47:07.575
-Hey.
-What the fuck
are we gonna do now?

47:07.617 --> 47:10.161
Butcher? It's me.

47:10.203 --> 47:13.998
No, I'm afraid Hugh let our star
witness burn himself to death.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.459
-Thank you.
-MALLORY: Well, I don't know.

47:18.461 --> 47:19.712
What do you mean, no worries?

47:19.754 --> 47:22.257
I mean, I've got it sorted.

47:22.298 --> 47:24.050
(phone beeps)

47:28.263 --> 47:30.265
(bell jingles)

47:38.439 --> 47:40.483
You're gonna stitch me up again?

47:40.525 --> 47:42.402
He's at the airport.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.070
I promise.

47:44.112 --> 47:46.990
You got a right bloody nerve,
you do.

47:47.031 --> 47:50.201
Ah, and I didn't mean
for it to go so bad.

47:50.243 --> 47:52.203
I'm sorry.

47:52.245 --> 47:54.539
You won't have to see him again.

47:54.581 --> 47:57.834
He ain't got much longer.
Couple of months.

48:00.044 --> 48:01.838
Tell me when it happens.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.631
I'll piss on his coffin.

48:03.673 --> 48:06.301
I didn't do it for him.

48:06.342 --> 48:08.595
(Connie sighs)

48:08.636 --> 48:09.846
He's a cunt.

48:15.143 --> 48:17.312
I just thought,

48:17.353 --> 48:21.274
when you saw
how helpless he is now...

48:21.316 --> 48:22.483
you'd let it go.

48:24.527 --> 48:27.030
He wouldn't have
this hold over you,

48:27.071 --> 48:29.824
and you wouldn't become like...

48:34.871 --> 48:36.539
Yeah, well...

48:38.082 --> 48:40.084
(mutters)

48:46.716 --> 48:48.551
(Connie sniffles)

48:48.593 --> 48:50.595
Mm.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.681

Mm.

This bipartisan committee

50:13.010 --> 50:14.971
<i>The testimony we're about</i>

50:15.012 --> 50:18.015
to hear today will prove
that Vought is guilty

50:18.057 --> 50:20.601
of corporate malfeasance
and multiple felonies.

50:20.643 --> 50:22.311
And it'll come from someone

50:22.353 --> 50:24.814
that has witnessed
these crimes directly.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.641
Do you swear that the testimony
you're about to give today

51:00.683 --> 51:03.019
will be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

51:03.060 --> 51:04.520
-I do.
-Thank you.
