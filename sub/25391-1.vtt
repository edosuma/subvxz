00:00.172 --> 00:02.375
And the commercial would
begin with a cartoon version

00:02.408 --> 00:05.244
of you who keeps popping up
and talking about all the deals

00:05.278 --> 00:07.125
you have at Mr. Alvin's.

00:07.281 --> 00:08.449
Oh, I love that.

00:08.718 --> 00:09.883
Looks just like me.

00:09.917 --> 00:11.185
Yeah, we figured that he'd keep on

00:11.218 --> 00:12.820
popping up and he'd be like,

00:12.853 --> 00:13.921
"Come
on down to Mr. Alvin's."

00:13.954 --> 00:16.423
We've got FILA 29, or two for 50."

00:16.457 --> 00:18.812
"Nike, 29 or two for 50."

00:19.649 --> 00:21.183
Why does he sound like that?

00:21.942 --> 00:23.030
I'm sorry?

00:23.063 --> 00:25.158
Why does the cartoon sound like that?

00:26.318 --> 00:27.413
Oh, he doesn't.

00:27.413 --> 00:28.616
Yeah.

00:29.186 --> 00:30.607
You do. You sound like that.

00:30.632 --> 00:31.788
That's right.

00:32.913 --> 00:34.395
I like the cartoon.

00:34.966 --> 00:37.180
Just don't make him
sound all stupid and shit.

00:38.290 --> 00:40.204
Have you heard your voice?

00:40.647 --> 00:43.496
That is our eighth yes in a row!

00:43.521 --> 00:45.907
My friend, we are
officially on a hot streak.

00:45.932 --> 00:47.066
- Officially!
- Officially!

00:47.091 --> 00:49.060
Gentlemen, are you ready to go to dinner?

00:49.093 --> 00:50.495
What are you talking about?

00:50.528 --> 00:51.529
Oh sh...

00:51.609 --> 00:52.804
- Oh, yes.
- No.

00:52.876 --> 00:54.098
- That's right.
- Dinner.

00:54.132 --> 00:55.433
Oh, your anniversary dinner!

00:55.466 --> 00:57.602
Oh, well, two reasons to celebrate!

00:57.668 --> 00:58.731
Shall we go?

00:58.731 --> 01:00.538
Guys, you're dressed like shit.

01:01.216 --> 01:03.170
Yeah, but you look like you're
about to go on the Titanic.

01:03.203 --> 01:05.405
Oh, boom, beast. Let's go.

01:05.438 --> 01:07.308
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on now!

01:11.466 --> 01:12.901
I guess you didn't like your food.

01:12.934 --> 01:14.298
Then why'd I finish it, butt-munch?

01:14.323 --> 01:15.501
Don't be an asshole.

01:17.922 --> 01:19.101
To Sheila!

01:19.101 --> 01:21.186
And her 50 years with the company!

01:22.504 --> 01:25.266
That old gray mare is
still what she used to be.

01:26.709 --> 01:28.477
You must have seen it all.

01:28.510 --> 01:30.680
Yeah, what was it like back
when you started, Sheila?

01:31.113 --> 01:33.382
It was the golden age of advertising.

01:33.415 --> 01:35.592
And your father was the best.

01:35.992 --> 01:37.499
I even had my moment.

01:38.020 --> 01:41.168
Did you know I came up with the tagline

01:41.315 --> 01:43.462
for Wick's pantyhose?

01:43.848 --> 01:47.463
"Control top to make him lose control."

01:48.630 --> 01:50.310
That's pretty racy.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.569
I was talking about making
the man ejaculate early.

01:53.602 --> 01:55.001
Oh, cool. Mm-hmm.

01:55.001 --> 01:58.021
Of course there was no
credit and I wasn't paid,

01:58.549 --> 02:00.696
because I was just a secretary.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.422
It was a different world back then.

02:02.447 --> 02:04.476
Sam, you would've had a hell of a time.

02:04.501 --> 02:05.736
- Oh, I know.
- Yeah, we all would've.

02:05.769 --> 02:07.004
Well...

02:07.037 --> 02:08.005
We all would've had a bad time.

02:08.038 --> 02:09.133
Not the same.

02:10.139 --> 02:11.805
Well, happy 50th, Sheila.

02:12.509 --> 02:14.445
And happy hot streak!

02:14.478 --> 02:16.013
Eight in a row, baby!

02:17.614 --> 02:18.955
Gentlemen, thank you.

02:18.956 --> 02:22.086
You've made an old lady very, very drunk.

02:22.119 --> 02:24.068
- We'll walk you out.
- No, no, no, no, no.

02:24.093 --> 02:25.422
We got that big pitch tomorrow.

02:25.456 --> 02:27.264
We have to get hammered so we
can have a good night's rest.

02:27.289 --> 02:28.827
Oh, that's right. You know
how to get out, Sheila.

02:28.852 --> 02:29.944
Same way you came in, just backwards.

02:29.969 --> 02:31.077
You good to get home?

02:31.102 --> 02:32.196
You're gonna take an Uber, right?

02:32.229 --> 02:33.268
Oh, yeah.

02:34.872 --> 02:36.333
This beer's giving me heartburn.

02:36.367 --> 02:38.469

Bob Seger's diet tequila.

Yeah, me too.

02:48.212 --> 02:49.647
- Yes, I'm Tim Cramblin.
- Come on.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.682
Yep, I'm Tim Cramblin,

02:51.715 --> 02:53.045

She got a DUI after your dinner last night.

you were gonna take an Uber,

09:41.217 --> 09:42.254
I don't.

09:42.254 --> 09:44.252
Oh, well, they were very
vague on the phone, so...

09:44.286 --> 09:46.012
Well, I'm sorry. I can't help you.

09:46.388 --> 09:47.779
Well, you should get some desk candies

09:47.804 --> 09:49.305
that don't taste like medicine.

09:49.465 --> 09:50.492
That is my medicine.

Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

09:52.716 --> 09:54.362
I'm so sorry I ate all your
medicine. But you know what?

09:54.396 --> 09:55.935
You shouldn't keep them
on the desk like that,

09:55.960 --> 09:57.350
so really it's both of our faults, really.

09:57.375 --> 09:58.563

10:15.380 --> 10:16.481
Yeah, I just drank it too fast.

10:16.515 --> 10:18.317
Yeah, you can't slug it
too fast, or the bubbles...

10:18.350 --> 10:19.484
The bubbles.

So what's this all about?

10:20.886 --> 10:22.454
You pissed because we
got the Science Center?

10:22.487 --> 10:23.555
Yeah.

10:23.588 --> 10:25.390
Looks like we swung for the fences,

10:25.424 --> 10:27.850
and your ass struck out.

10:28.694 --> 10:31.797
We would like to buy Cramblin Duvet.

Is this a joke?

10:37.214 --> 10:39.671
'Cause if it is a joke, I
just want to say that I get it.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.607
I get the joke, and I'm in on it also.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.248
- And it's hilarious.
- No.

10:43.273 --> 10:44.508
No, it's not a joke.

At Doner, we believe
if you can't beat them,

10:51.617 --> 10:52.695
you buy 'em.

10:54.853 --> 10:57.002
What does... what does this mean, exactly?

10:57.556 --> 11:00.525
- You'd own Cramblin Duvet...
- Correct. Mm-hmm.

11:00.559 --> 11:01.986
So what would we do?

11:02.427 --> 11:03.962
- We'd own Doner.
- We'd own Doner, right.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.864
Yeah. That's interesting.

11:05.897 --> 11:07.118
Then yeah, I'll do it.

11:07.118 --> 11:08.487
No, no, no. It's not a trade.

11:09.073 --> 11:10.188
Yeah, we know.

11:10.221 --> 11:12.390
Yeah, I know. I'm not stupid.

11:12.423 --> 11:13.825
Basically, you would be getting paid

11:13.858 --> 11:15.359
to do exactly what you've been doing,

11:15.393 --> 11:17.688
you would just be doing it for Doner.

11:18.162 --> 11:20.426
And... and we would keep our name?

11:20.933 --> 11:22.403
No, we would change the name.

- Team Viper.
- Excuse me?

11:24.123 --> 11:25.360

- Yeah, we're the Rowdy Boys.
- Guys, look.

11:31.831 --> 11:34.119
I think you'll find it's a
generous buyout fee, okay?

11:34.119 --> 11:35.525
Not to mention a bump in salary,

11:35.525 --> 11:38.437
and you'd have all of Doner's
resources at your disposal.

11:40.417 --> 11:42.332
Seriously, you got something.

11:42.708 --> 11:45.378
You made the worst
lawyer in town look cool.

11:45.576 --> 11:47.313
I don't know if he's the worst.

11:47.505 --> 11:49.815
He's pretty bad. My
cousin got bit by a dog.

11:49.849 --> 11:51.142
He couldn't do anything for him.

11:51.550 --> 11:52.952
I thought he was a mack at dog bites.

11:52.985 --> 11:54.096
That's what he said.

Guys, think about it. Talk to your lawyer.

11:57.088 --> 11:58.229

11:58.229 --> 12:00.075
Well, I mean I'd rather sleep in a bed.

12:00.108 --> 12:02.010
Not my best.

12:02.044 --> 12:04.346

12:07.916 --> 12:09.484
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

12:09.518 --> 12:11.249
I ate her medicine.

- Earlier today.

14:37.511 --> 14:38.679
Well, you got to find somebody.

16:22.457 --> 16:23.871
We couldn't get any good ones.

16:23.919 --> 16:26.903
Yeah, besides, these actors seem very real.

16:26.936 --> 16:28.201
No, they don't.

16:28.226 --> 16:30.773
And not to mention you
portrayed a Science Center

16:30.807 --> 16:32.475
employee hitting a child.

16:32.508 --> 16:35.318
A child bully. It's a
very important distinction.

16:35.318 --> 16:37.086
Maybe we need to start
looking for a different firm.

16:37.119 --> 16:39.085
No, don't do that in front of us.

16:39.523 --> 16:41.225
I told you this is a work in progress.

16:47.725 --> 16:49.260
We'll have a whole new concept for you.

16:49.627 --> 16:51.195
Are you sure you're capable

16:51.228 --> 16:53.364
of delivering a Science Center worthy ad?

16:53.451 --> 16:54.993
No, they can't.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.635
These two guys are pieces of shit.

17:00.391 --> 17:01.841

17:06.210 --> 17:08.813
Guys, look, going with you guys

17:08.846 --> 17:11.152
was kind of just an experiment on our part.

17:11.176 --> 17:13.217
We just wanted to try
something fun and kitschy,

17:13.250 --> 17:15.419
but let's just face it, okay?

17:15.582 --> 17:18.681
We're the Science Center,
and, frankly, you're not.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.334
That is devastating.

17:36.508 --> 17:38.230
We're sorry we hired you a terrible lawyer.

17:38.775 --> 17:41.312

and we were assholes.

17:41.345 --> 17:42.580
Please forgive us.

17:42.613 --> 17:44.979
You were raging assholes.

17:44.979 --> 17:46.949
And you want to know
what really pisses me off?

17:47.418 --> 17:49.949
I worked for this company for 50 years,

17:49.949 --> 17:52.156
and you never once asked me what I thought

17:52.189 --> 17:53.457
about you selling it.

17:53.726 --> 17:55.310
When Big Hank left,

17:55.526 --> 17:58.471
I was the only employee who stuck with you.

17:58.471 --> 18:02.115
Now you just treat me like some
old lady you have to deal with.

18:03.552 --> 18:04.709
You're right.

18:05.024 --> 18:07.271
We're two idiots who you

And we'll do whatever it takes to show you

18:11.551 --> 18:12.753
what you mean to the company.

18:12.786 --> 18:13.787
Make me a partner.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.022
A partner?

18:15.055 --> 18:16.823
- No!
- What are you talking about?

18:18.355 --> 18:19.493
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

18:19.526 --> 18:20.560
- Sorry, I apologize.
- We weren't expecting that.

18:20.594 --> 18:21.977
We got a little overwhelmed.

18:21.977 --> 18:23.632
Yeah, you really had that
locked and loaded, didn't you?

18:23.657 --> 18:25.146
I have given it a lot of thought.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.064
- We'll make you a partner.
- Silent partner.

18:31.453 --> 18:34.444
And I'll be involved with
all the major decisions?

18:35.463 --> 18:36.898
Starting with the big one.

18:38.833 --> 18:42.035
We've thought long and
hard about your offer.

18:42.094 --> 18:44.477
Yes, and this is the amount

18:45.227 --> 18:46.331
that we are willing

18:46.365 --> 18:47.996
to sell our company for.

18:49.149 --> 18:50.244
Yes. Yeah. That's good.

18:52.219 --> 18:53.430
Here you go.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.196
Okay, I'll give it to you.

18:57.412 --> 18:58.541
Excuse me.

18:59.867 --> 19:01.019
Sorry.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.069
Don't act like it hurt, you idiot.

19:06.496 --> 19:07.843
That's good. There we go.

19:13.627 --> 19:14.745
What is this?

19:14.745 --> 19:16.597
That is a middle finger, butt-munch.

19:16.741 --> 19:18.242
Thank you for the offer and everything.

19:18.276 --> 19:21.272
But it's a respectful no.

19:21.379 --> 19:23.046
That felt good.

19:23.781 --> 19:25.084
Nice work, partner.

19:25.817 --> 19:27.104
You good to drive?

19:27.218 --> 19:28.526
Oh, yeah.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.403
Sheila! Could you come in
here for a second, please?

19:53.176 --> 19:54.895
Sheila, years ago,

19:54.920 --> 19:56.263
you did some work for this company

19:56.288 --> 19:57.685
that went uncredited

19:57.686 --> 19:59.442
and we would like to fix that.

20:00.314 --> 20:02.732
Here's the check you should
have been paid 40 years ago.

20:03.013 --> 20:04.616
Inflation not included.

20:05.319 --> 20:07.438
Oh, thank you, gentlemen.

20:08.805 --> 20:09.989
How do I cash it?

20:09.989 --> 20:11.989
No, you don't. It's, uh... ceremonial.

20:12.013 --> 20:14.013
Do I take the whole thing to the bank?

20:14.037 --> 20:15.183
No, Sheila, don't cash it.

20:15.208 --> 20:16.551
It's for you to have.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.029
- Just put it on a wall so...
- Oh!

20:18.053 --> 20:20.505
And we have another surprise for you!

20:20.872 --> 20:23.261
I found Tim and Sam's April D video.

20:23.284 --> 20:25.348
And it really sucks!

20:25.373 --> 20:26.430
There's no way it sucks.
