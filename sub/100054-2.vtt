WEBVTT

01:54.201 --> 01:55.289
- We're under attack!

02:01.860 --> 02:03.732
- Run, run, run, run!

02:03.775 --> 02:05.908
Come on, Brendan,
get up! Get up!

02:23.926 --> 02:26.668
- Anyone not dead, fall back!

02:26.711 --> 02:28.887
- Quist, come on!

02:28.931 --> 02:30.193
Head for that building!

02:30.237 --> 02:32.369
Run, run, run!

02:32.413 --> 02:33.979
Move it!

02:38.027 --> 02:39.289
- MAN: Move, move, move!

02:41.987 --> 02:43.859
- Clear!

02:43.902 --> 02:45.469
- Doc, Rivers,
cover those windows.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.691
Quist, cover our tail with Doc.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.129
- Stay low.
Watch for a second wave.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.179
- Doc, anyone out there?

03:01.311 --> 03:03.008
- Negative. Nothing moving
over here.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.491
- Looks like we lost 'em.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.840
Stay sharp, people.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.240
- Cap, what about
Glenn and Denards?

03:17.284 --> 03:19.416
Shouldn't we go back?
Or at least--

03:19.460 --> 03:21.592
- CAPTAIN: Glenn and
Denards are dead, Rivers.

03:21.636 --> 03:24.073
We're all that's left
of B Company.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.422
We're on our own.

03:25.466 --> 03:26.728
- Tell you what.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.251
This whole freaking mission
has been

03:28.295 --> 03:30.297
a goddamn shit sandwich
since Normandy.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.081
We got Krauts to the left.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.604
Freaking minefields
to the right.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.215
How you gonna get us
out of this one, Talby?

03:35.258 --> 03:37.304
- Captain Talby.
- Whatever, wiseass.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.436
- I'm thinking about it.
- Really?

03:39.480 --> 03:42.091
That makes me feel a whole
lot better...Captain.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.447
What the hell is this
place supposed to be anyway?

03:50.491 --> 03:52.667
- It appears to have been
a local police station.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.934
- Looks like they
had some trouble, too.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.892
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:10.598 --> 04:11.599
- What the fuck happened here?

04:11.642 --> 04:14.123
Jesus.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.605
- Ooh!

04:17.648 --> 04:19.520
Dear God.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.348
Hey, we got a man down.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.437
We got a couple of 'em.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.961
Oh, would you look at
this shit on my boot, man?

04:29.486 --> 04:32.620
So sorry, sir.
I'm so sorry. I just--

04:32.663 --> 04:34.274
- You goddamn baby.

04:34.317 --> 04:35.492
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

04:35.536 --> 04:37.494
- Leave him be, Quist.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.670
- This piss tank just
yacked all over my foot.

04:39.714 --> 04:40.889
- And I said leave him be.

04:40.932 --> 04:43.065
Stop being an asshole
for two seconds.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.458
- Oh, I'm being the asshole?

04:44.501 --> 04:46.198
- No, Bugs Bunny's the asshole.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.026
Of course you are.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.246
- Gentlemen, this is the last
thing we need right now.

04:56.426 --> 04:58.385
- Hail Mary full of grace.

04:59.995 --> 05:00.952
- What happened here?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.520
- Captain, his
throat's slashed.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.782
He can't talk.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.354
- He's dead.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.619
- Boo fucking hoo.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.318
Hey, Rivers, you wanna
light a candle for him?

06:03.450 --> 06:07.236
-  Hans.

06:07.279 --> 06:11.327
You foolish, foolish boy.

06:14.504 --> 06:19.161
How could my...only son...

06:19.204 --> 06:20.075
allow this?

06:23.774 --> 06:28.823
You have dishonored
the Schmelzgerat name.

06:32.827 --> 06:37.397
But I will find
these American dogs

06:37.440 --> 06:40.487
responsible for this.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.141
And they--

06:43.185 --> 06:48.364
they will suffer...greatly.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.807
- Sir?

06:56.851 --> 06:58.243
What are we gonna do?

07:02.987 --> 07:04.641
- We got a map here.

07:04.685 --> 07:07.470
- Hail Mary full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

07:07.514 --> 07:08.993
Bless--

07:09.037 --> 07:11.822
- Village of
10 kilometers.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.258
- We're near Le Monge.

07:13.302 --> 07:16.000
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
hey, that's our rally point.

07:16.044 --> 07:18.394
Alright, we make it there, our
asses our saved. We gotta go.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.527
- Hell ya.
Prepare to move out.

07:20.570 --> 07:21.745
- WOMAN:

07:21.789 --> 07:23.921
- Jesus!

07:30.493 --> 07:32.147
- Jesus, man.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.844
- You shot a civilian, Rivers.

07:33.888 --> 07:34.976
- She grabbed me.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.499
I didn't know
anybody was in there.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.287
- I'm--I'm so sorry, ma'am.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.725
I didn't mean--

07:47.728 --> 07:49.556
- Captain, she'll bleed out
if I don't get in there soon.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.296
- Find the keys. They must be
around here somewhere.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.516
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Cap, Cap, listen to me.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.953
Every goddamn wienerschnitzel
in this whole goddamn

07:55.997 --> 07:57.389
German army
would have heard that shot.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.000
- Ah!
- We gotta am-scray now.

07:59.043 --> 08:01.263
- You wanna get out
of here, find the keys.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.307
- I can't find them.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.048
I--I'm sorry.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.180
I'm sorry.

08:05.223 --> 08:08.923
- Sorry.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.228
They're in the jail!

08:10.272 --> 08:12.404
- Oh my God.

08:12.448 --> 08:15.277
- Get those keys, Rivers.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.931
- I can't. They're too far.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.019
- Here.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.762
Snag 'em with this.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.720
- WOMAN:

08:23.764 --> 08:25.069
- Listen, Talby.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.549
Listen to me, we're good
as dead if we stay here,

08:26.593 --> 08:27.768
and you know it.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.292
- WOMAN:

08:30.335 --> 08:32.120
- Button your lip, Sergeant,
or I'll button it for real.

08:36.820 --> 08:41.912
- WOMAN:

08:41.956 --> 08:42.826
- I got 'em!

08:42.870 --> 08:43.958
I got 'em!

08:48.223 --> 08:50.007
No!

08:50.051 --> 08:53.097
- No! no! No!
- It's okay.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.577
- Help me hold her down!

08:54.621 --> 08:58.929
- WOMAN:

09:05.893 --> 09:07.111
- Christ, she's strong.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.199
Doc, what is she saying?

09:08.243 --> 09:09.723
- "Don't kill me.
Go away, I think."

09:12.464 --> 09:14.902
- She might also be saying,
"Go away or I'll kill you."

09:14.945 --> 09:16.686
- Kill us?
- This is crazy, man.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.209
She's gonna give
away our position.

09:19.820 --> 09:22.692
- Fuck this!

09:22.736 --> 09:24.172
- Quist, put that gun away!

09:24.215 --> 09:25.826
- I don't think so, Tommy.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.393
Either way I'm getting
killed over some fog bitch.

09:28.437 --> 09:29.873
- No!

09:34.965 --> 09:38.839
- Ah!

09:41.668 --> 09:44.366
You guys are all a bunch
of goddamn lunatics!

09:44.409 --> 09:46.629
- What happened to you, Quist?

09:46.673 --> 09:48.326
You used to be
someone I could trust.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.244
War changes a man.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.463
- Bastard!

09:54.506 --> 09:55.986
- Sorry, boys.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.118
- Come back here, Quist!

09:57.161 --> 10:00.034
- Can't risk a bullet
in the back.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.471
- Quist!

10:02.514 --> 10:04.081
Quist!

10:07.389 --> 10:08.564
- CAPTAIN:  Quist!

10:17.617 --> 10:18.879
Shit!

10:18.922 --> 10:20.489
- Captain, what
are we gonna do?

10:24.014 --> 10:27.365
- I'll get us out of here,
Rivers, come hell or high water.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.410
I promise.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.673
- Captain, come here.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.153
- She not gonna make it, Doc?

10:45.732 --> 10:47.037
- My God.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.302
What are you?

10:54.044 --> 10:56.220
- "I locked myself
in this cage."

10:58.875 --> 11:00.442
- I cannot die.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.667
- The curse make me
do so many bad things.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.977
- I kill people.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.154
- Kill--

11:18.242 --> 11:20.244
- --children.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.682
- No more death.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.335
- No more killing.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.513
- Please just let me die.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.738
- Loup garou!

11:35.782 --> 11:37.174
- Lugaroo?

11:37.218 --> 11:38.959
- Loup garou.

11:39.002 --> 11:42.527
It means...wolf man.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.094
- Or wolf woman.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.236
- She wasn't trying
to grab me before.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.240
She wanted my cross.

12:02.417 --> 12:05.202
- "Please just let me die."

12:05.246 --> 12:06.638
- It's silver.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.126
- MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Attention, American soldiers!

12:16.170 --> 12:17.824
We know you are inside.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.739
My men have
the building surrounded.

12:19.782 --> 12:20.740
- Perfect timing.

12:24.221 --> 12:28.791
- I will be, as you Americans
like to say, to the point.

12:28.835 --> 12:33.143
One of you...killed...

12:33.187 --> 12:35.755
my only son today,

12:35.798 --> 12:41.151
who causes all of you will die!

12:41.195 --> 12:45.634
But I am a man of honor,
and so I offer you a choice.

12:45.677 --> 12:51.335
If...you come out now
unarmed and accept your fate,

12:51.379 --> 12:54.686
your death will be
quick and painless.

12:54.730 --> 12:59.343
But if you force me
to risk the lives of my men...

12:59.387 --> 13:03.565
to expel your filthy hides...

13:03.608 --> 13:08.091
you will die in unimaginable...

13:08.135 --> 13:10.572
agony.

13:10.615 --> 13:13.009
I await your response.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.619
- Damn.

13:35.727 --> 13:39.253
- Here, ma'am, take it.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.994
It'll do you more
good than it did us.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.002
- Hold up.

13:54.921 --> 13:58.925
- But before you die, we need
you to do something for us.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.281
- This is
Captain Lawrence Talby

14:07.324 --> 14:09.109
of the United Stated Army.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.893
And I've considered your offer.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.199
- What is your answer,

14:12.242 --> 14:15.811
Captain Talby
of the United States Army?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.421
- CAPTAIN: Let me
be to the point!

14:18.901 --> 14:22.296
If you want our filthy hides...

14:22.339 --> 14:25.865
come in here and get 'em!

14:25.908 --> 14:27.518
- Good.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.260
That is good.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.435
We are going in.

14:31.479 --> 14:34.264
Attack at sundown.

14:34.308 --> 14:35.439
- Hurry, let her do it.

14:41.054 --> 14:43.056
- Deploy smoke grenades.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.203
- Thank you.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.857
You...

15:10.779 --> 15:12.781
-  I don't feel
any different.

15:12.824 --> 15:15.001
- What if it ain't
gonna work on us?

15:15.044 --> 15:16.654
- Captain?

15:16.698 --> 15:17.960
- Captain?

15:19.135 --> 15:21.094
- I promised I'd get
you out of here.

15:25.141 --> 15:28.579
Come hell or high water.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.931
- My God, wolf man.

16:19.674 --> 16:20.762
- Fire!

17:05.328 --> 17:07.548
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

17:14.163 --> 17:16.687
- You filthy dog!

18:06.563 --> 18:07.782
- Hello, Sergeant.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.697
- Talby.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.915
- I thought you'd
never wake up.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.361
- Ssshh.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.801
- Doc and Rivers wish they
could've been here, but they're,

18:26.844 --> 18:30.718
um, grabbing a bite to
eat with some Germans.

18:30.761 --> 18:34.809
So it's just you...and me.

18:34.852 --> 18:38.682
-  Talby, I'm
so sorry--I'm so sorry about

18:38.726 --> 18:40.510
what happened back there.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.512
I was scared.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.514
Talby! Talby!

18:44.558 --> 18:47.735
You're--you're--you're
not the kind of guy

18:47.778 --> 18:50.607
that would hurt
a defenseless asshole like me.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.140
- It's like you said, Sergeant.

19:03.011 --> 19:05.753
War changes a man.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.555
- CLARK: My name
is Clark Wilson.

20:08.598 --> 20:11.340
And I gotta say, there's some
pretty weird shit going on.

20:13.864 --> 20:16.824
Now, I usually consider myself
a guy who has his shit together,

20:16.867 --> 20:21.742
because most of the time,
well--I'll get into that later.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.832
But in this case, this is all
a bit out of the ordinary,

20:24.875 --> 20:27.791
I gotta say.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.271
I can hear you.

20:38.454 --> 20:39.890
I got a big fucking gun here!

21:00.346 --> 21:01.912
But I don't want
to get too ahead of myself,

21:01.956 --> 21:03.392
so let me start over.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.179
You know how they say
nobody walks in L.A.?

21:08.223 --> 21:11.182
Well, I'm the guy
who walks in L.A.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.881
Like I said before, my
name is Clark Wilson.

21:13.924 --> 21:17.319
I have what you might call
a passion for found objects.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.800
You know, everyday things that
have been lost, thrown away,

21:19.843 --> 21:21.932
or abandoned.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.282
Take this lock for instance.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.808
This used to be new once.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.288
It had a purpose.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.028
It was useful once.

21:31.072 --> 21:33.683
And now it's been forsaken.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.337
Kinda like me, if you
wanna get right down to it.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.691
Now, I had this friend
once who had this dog.

21:41.735 --> 21:44.607
Now, he claimed that if you fed
this dog some weed

21:44.651 --> 21:45.782
in a rolling paper,

21:45.826 --> 21:47.828
it would poop out
a perfectly rolled joint.

21:47.871 --> 21:50.526
Now, I never saw the dog do it.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.659
And I never really
believed that story.

21:52.702 --> 21:56.227
But...actually,
come to think of it,

21:56.271 --> 21:58.142
you're probably not gonna
believe this story either.

22:14.594 --> 22:15.856
- CLARK: The last thing
I expected that night

22:15.899 --> 22:18.337
was to get
the finger...for real.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.429
It was verification that the
whole world was flipping me off.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.909
"Hey, fuck you, loser."

22:25.953 --> 22:29.130
Or maybe...just maybe,

22:29.173 --> 22:31.741
it was the other way around.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.614
I guess I'm just your average,
ordinary, so-called citizen.

22:34.657 --> 22:35.702
Mortgage sucks.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.573
Job prospects suck.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.836
Abandoned by my so-called
family three years ago.

22:45.451 --> 22:49.368
Anyway, I got this house
when Samantha divorced me.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.021
I got the crap house,
the shit mortgage,

22:51.065 --> 22:52.762
the lamentable car,

22:52.806 --> 22:55.112
and a career in web design.

22:55.156 --> 22:58.159
Which is a cute way of saying
I'm mostly unemployed.

22:58.202 --> 22:59.378
I hang on.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.596
I telecommute.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.337
Well, that's what I tell people.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.601
I tell them I
tele--you know what?

23:05.645 --> 23:06.776
Never mind.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.218
Armadillo? No.

23:14.262 --> 23:15.655
Raccoon?

23:15.698 --> 23:16.830
No.

23:16.873 --> 23:19.441
Is it a possum?

23:19.485 --> 23:20.877
Uh, no.

23:20.921 --> 23:23.053
- Fuck!

23:23.097 --> 23:26.666
Ugh! Goddamn it.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.588
- Wow.

23:35.631 --> 23:36.502
That's noteworthy.

23:39.330 --> 23:42.333
You, my friend, are a keeper.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.311
- WOMAN ON PHONE: This is
a call from a debt collector.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.313
This call may be recorded
for quality assurance.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.097
Your account is important to us.

24:07.141 --> 24:08.664
- Why don't you
just fucking die?

24:08.708 --> 24:11.667
Die, die, die,
you fucking vampires!

24:16.193 --> 24:18.065
Sorry.

24:18.108 --> 24:21.416
I'm not normally
this...um, agro.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.375
It's just--I mean, come on.

24:24.419 --> 24:25.899
You hate them, too, right?

24:25.942 --> 24:28.075
Those anonymous people,
who aren't even really people.

24:30.817 --> 24:33.994
Don't you just wish you
could make them suffer?

24:34.037 --> 24:35.865
Suffer the way they've
made you suffer?

24:37.650 --> 24:40.827
Anyway, the instant
family from hell, right?

24:43.220 --> 24:45.832
Had reached its sell-by date.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.095
Samantha eventually needed
someone who could do more

24:48.138 --> 24:51.402
than get things off
a high shelf,

24:51.446 --> 24:53.317
fetch her tampons,

24:53.361 --> 24:54.667
run out to the store at 3:00AM

24:54.710 --> 24:57.713
to buy those pretentious
little cigarettes.

24:57.757 --> 25:01.891
Her idiot son, Ricky, stole
my car and tried to hock it.

25:01.935 --> 25:04.111
Her daughter once offered me
a blowjob to keep quiet

25:04.154 --> 25:06.069
about her meth habit
and the fact that

25:06.113 --> 25:09.377
her latest fiancée
was doing time for murder.

25:09.420 --> 25:13.381
But, hey, it's
the American dream, right?

25:13.424 --> 25:15.731
Domestic bliss.

25:15.775 --> 25:18.821
Sam used to say, "It's the way
it's supposed to be."

25:21.432 --> 25:22.433
No, it's not.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.392
Blogs? Seriously?

25:24.435 --> 25:26.699
What year is this, Blurserno?
2006?

25:26.742 --> 25:28.265
- BLURSERNO ON PHONE:
They're clients, Clark.

25:28.309 --> 25:29.963
They're digitally challenged.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.704
It's work, for fuck's sake.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.053
- It's donkey work.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.620
I'm not doing it.

25:34.663 --> 25:37.971
- BLURSERNO ON PHONE:
It's donkey work that pays.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.189
- Let me call you back.

25:48.242 --> 25:49.373
- Goddamn it.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.479
- Holy hell.

26:25.932 --> 26:29.892
- CLARK: And within 24 hours,
I had myself a whole arm.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.459
The suspense was killing me.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.028
I'm beginning to think maybe
I need to call a grownup.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.075
What would an adult do?

26:52.306 --> 26:54.134
- Maybe I should call a museum.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.875
Or a mad scientist.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.921
Or maybe, just maybe...

26:58.965 --> 27:01.445
I can wait
a little while longer.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.173
- CLARK: This wasn't like
misplacing a set of keys.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.523
This was the first time
something I had salvaged,

27:35.566 --> 27:38.004
something I had
saved...

27:38.047 --> 27:39.440
abandoned me.

27:55.151 --> 27:56.587
- Fuckers.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.172
- I can hear you.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.096
- I've got a big
fucking gun here!

28:48.378 --> 28:50.598
- CLARK: What the holy hell?

29:07.354 --> 29:10.487
- That's--that's a heart.

29:18.626 --> 29:19.758
- Yeah, what?

29:21.542 --> 29:23.283
I mean, hi.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.414
Can I help you?

29:24.458 --> 29:25.981
- Mr. Wilson?

29:26.025 --> 29:27.504
Clark Wilson?

29:27.548 --> 29:28.723
- Yeah, that's me, alright.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.985
- Sorry to disturb
you at this hour.

29:30.029 --> 29:30.986
I'm Detective Moseley.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.466
This is Detective Walsh.

29:32.509 --> 29:33.946
We have ourselves a situation.

29:35.904 --> 29:38.254
Samantha Brown Demara was
your ex-wife, correct?

29:44.260 --> 29:45.914
- Was?

29:45.958 --> 29:49.700
- There was a disturbance
at her condo...earlier today.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.224
Samantha Brown
Demara--

29:51.267 --> 29:53.574
- Ooh, that went on for
like 20 more minutes.

29:53.617 --> 29:56.011
But you get the gist of it.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.622
All I can say is, thank God they
didn't have search warrant.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.540
- DETECTIVE: --she
actually passed away.

30:03.584 --> 30:07.762
-  Oh, dear God, no.

30:07.806 --> 30:12.723
No. Not my Samantha.

30:12.767 --> 30:15.117
Not my beautiful Samantha.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.946
Tell me you're lying.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.557
Tell me she's okay.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.690
Please, tell me she's not--

30:22.733 --> 30:24.605
- DETECTIVE: Do you need
us to call anybody for you?

30:27.129 --> 30:28.739
Bitch didn't
even have any contacts,

30:28.783 --> 30:30.306
that's how much
everyone hated her.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.743
Well, except her ex-husband.
Me.

30:32.787 --> 30:37.096
And of course, no one could find
her kids--the unholy spawn.

30:37.139 --> 30:39.446
Anyway, inquiries
have been initiated,

30:39.489 --> 30:41.100
I would be kept informed.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.232
Hooray. Three cheers for me.

30:43.276 --> 30:44.277
But I was scared.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.583
I needed to sort
this the fuck out.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.195
They're gonna come back.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.674
You'll see.

30:50.718 --> 30:51.632
They'll want pictures.

30:51.675 --> 30:54.069
They always want pictures.

30:54.113 --> 30:55.331
More questions.

30:55.375 --> 30:58.204
"Where were you
on the night of?"

30:58.247 --> 31:01.468
They'll be excuses,
alibis, lies.

31:02.861 --> 31:03.992
Pictures.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.124
Where's that picture?

31:09.258 --> 31:10.520
I must have shot that.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.349
Little shits.

31:57.176 --> 32:00.179
- Ah!

32:13.453 --> 32:15.281
- Hi.

32:17.152 --> 32:20.547
- What are you?

32:20.590 --> 32:23.506
Do you need to go outside?

32:23.550 --> 32:24.855
Right, right, right.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.684
If you need to go outside,
you'll go outside.

32:27.728 --> 32:30.949
I'm just gonna take a
little picture, alright?

32:34.256 --> 32:35.431
- They'll be just
a little flash.

32:35.475 --> 32:36.780
Don't be scared.

32:44.005 --> 32:44.963
- So what do I call you?

32:47.661 --> 32:50.664
Bob? You like that?

32:50.707 --> 32:52.709
- Bob.

32:52.753 --> 32:53.972
Well, alright then.

33:15.297 --> 33:16.951
- Now, let's not go tearing
anyone else's heart out tonight.

33:19.258 --> 33:22.000
- There, so much better.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.857
- CLARK: Turns out,
that Bob likes long,

33:53.901 --> 33:55.903
four multi-arc
television dramas.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.687
You know, soap opera writ large.

33:59.428 --> 34:02.257
- CLARK: The kind of story
that never actually ends.

34:05.434 --> 34:06.392
- And popcorn.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.220
He really likes popcorn.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.576
- How much you wanna bet
that's the police

34:16.619 --> 34:18.012
with just a few more questions?

34:19.970 --> 34:21.233
Yeah?
- WOMAN ON PHONE: This is a call

34:21.276 --> 34:22.756
from a debt collector.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.932
This call may be recorded--
- Fuck off, you Nazi bitch!

34:24.975 --> 34:26.412
Fuck off and leave me alone!

34:36.248 --> 34:37.901
- Oh, no.

34:37.945 --> 34:40.556
No, no, no, no, I wasn't
yelling at you, no.

34:46.345 --> 34:48.564
- CLARK: Yeah, see, it's okay.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.833
- CLARK: I threw that
away last night, didn't I?

34:56.877 --> 34:58.270
Bob's little offering to me.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.709
You know how to
fetch, don't you?

35:05.625 --> 35:07.409
Oh, Christ.

35:23.556 --> 35:24.992
- Forget locks and doors.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.255
Bob wants to go out,
he goes out.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.180
- Hey, goddamn it!

35:42.879 --> 35:44.838
- Hey, fuck you, asshole!

35:44.881 --> 35:48.276
- Well, fuck you too
you fuckity fuck-fuck!

35:54.326 --> 35:55.414
- Asshole.

35:57.198 --> 35:58.330
- So Bob went out last night,

35:58.373 --> 36:00.245
and he brought back
the truck balls.

36:00.288 --> 36:03.639
And he brought back
the guy's real balls as well.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.728
I had to look up testicles to
find out what they were made of.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.427
Basically fibrous tissue.

36:08.470 --> 36:10.733
Not nearly as tough, I assumed,
as a heart muscle.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.740
- CLARK: And then
Bob just disappeared.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.834
- CLARK: Ever had
your child kidnapped?

36:24.878 --> 36:26.575
No?

36:26.619 --> 36:28.229
Ever look out into the yard to
see that your favorite pet

36:28.273 --> 36:29.883
isn't there all of the sudden?

36:29.926 --> 36:31.667
This was a lot like that.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.016
Bob!

36:35.715 --> 36:37.325
- Bob?

36:37.369 --> 36:38.805
Bob!

36:44.593 --> 36:46.334
- Bob's back.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.127
- Bob.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.874
- He always naps after one
of his little excursions.

37:13.883 --> 37:15.537
- I didn't recognize
this one at first.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.932
That is a tongue.

37:22.762 --> 37:24.416
He knew.

37:24.459 --> 37:27.984
Somehow Bob knew who and where.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.812
- WOMAN ON PHONE: This is
a call from a debt collector.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.945
This call may be recorded
for quality assurance.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.555
Your account is important to us.

37:36.297 --> 37:40.083
- CLARK: It was
her--the Nazi bitch.

37:40.127 --> 37:44.479
Even though--God, where was she?

37:44.523 --> 37:48.266
Did Bob fly all the way
to a call center in Texas?

37:48.309 --> 37:50.224
Georgia?

37:50.268 --> 37:51.181
India?

37:57.579 --> 37:59.538
- CLARK: And, naturally,
just like I said,

37:59.581 --> 38:01.453
the nice police persons came
back for the pictures

38:01.496 --> 38:04.107
of Samantha's
kids--Shannon and Ricky.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.546
- Shannon and Ricky, who now
just as naturally

38:07.589 --> 38:08.808
cannot be found.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.382
Because guess who
got there first?

38:17.425 --> 38:21.037
I promise, uh, look, I've just
got so much work on right now.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.430
How 'bout if I call you--

38:22.474 --> 38:24.519
- You, uh--you got
something on your shirt.

38:24.563 --> 38:25.520
- Oh yeah.

38:25.564 --> 38:28.436
Uh, that's just a red sauce.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.177
You know, Bolognese.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.484
'Cause Bob had opted for another
one of his day trips

38:32.527 --> 38:33.528
or night flights.

38:33.572 --> 38:34.964
Bob!

38:41.188 --> 38:42.320
- Bob.

38:44.191 --> 38:45.192
- What?

38:53.026 --> 38:58.336
- BOB:

39:02.601 --> 39:04.907
- That's terrific, Bob.

39:04.951 --> 39:06.692
That's just great.

39:09.564 --> 39:11.261
- Now, if I take those
all the way across town

39:11.305 --> 39:12.524
and drop them in the ocean,

39:12.567 --> 39:13.699
you're just gonna
bring them right back here,

39:13.742 --> 39:14.830
aren't you?

39:17.093 --> 39:20.009
- You little shit.

39:32.761 --> 39:34.459
Just great.

40:08.580 --> 40:11.626
- I couldn't kill
Bob or get rid of him.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.802
I-I-I couldn't even hurt him.

40:13.846 --> 40:15.238
And why would I?

40:16.631 --> 40:19.025
All he wanted was to
eliminate anyone who hurt me.

40:20.635 --> 40:21.680
Isn't that love?

40:26.032 --> 40:27.120
I didn't do those things.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.731
Bob did those things.

40:29.775 --> 40:33.256
Like I told you before, all
I did was find this finger.

40:33.300 --> 40:36.085
And this finger grew into this
little critter called Bob.

40:39.175 --> 40:41.047
And like I told you before,
I already knew

40:41.090 --> 40:42.831
you weren't going
to believe this story.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.453
- How many people annoy you?

40:57.629 --> 41:00.588
Do you really ever
run out of candidates?

41:00.632 --> 41:03.373
The loudmouth ahead of
you in line in the market.

41:03.417 --> 41:05.854
The lunatic on the street
who wants your cigarettes,

41:05.898 --> 41:08.291
your spare change, enough of
your time to tell you

41:08.335 --> 41:10.250
his entire life tragedy.

41:10.293 --> 41:12.513
The bartender who ignores you.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.472
The lover who decides you're not
attractive enough,

41:14.515 --> 41:15.516
smart enough,

41:15.560 --> 41:16.952
or rich enough.

41:16.996 --> 41:18.432
Jehovah's Witnesses.

41:24.525 --> 41:25.570
But he will come.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.489
I'll hear him scratching
right up here.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.103
It's just a matter of time.

41:39.366 --> 41:40.280
You know Bob.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.675
If wants to come in,
he'll come in.

41:48.027 --> 41:49.463
Bob loves me.

41:53.728 --> 41:57.253
- BOB:

42:08.613 --> 42:10.353
- Bob loves me.
