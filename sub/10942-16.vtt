00:00.500 --> 00:01.490
<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i> :

00:01.492 --> 00:02.457
It's okay.

00:02.460 --> 00:04.191
(Bear growls)

00:04.200 --> 00:05.490
Whoa!

00:05.494 --> 00:07.529
Amy! Hey!

00:07.596 --> 00:09.697
Mallory:
What are you doing?!

00:09.765 --> 00:11.800
I am in the middle
of a shift!

00:11.867 --> 00:13.868
Well, he needs to be
brushed out,

00:13.937 --> 00:14.970
ridden a little

00:15.038 --> 00:16.704
and have his stall
cleaned.

00:16.772 --> 00:18.406
Supposed to be coming home
in a couple of days,

00:18.473 --> 00:21.309
but now she wants to stay
for another week or so.

00:21.376 --> 00:22.977
Well, I guess there's
more to see in Italy.

00:23.045 --> 00:24.478
You ever heard of a bride
not coming back

00:24.546 --> 00:26.647
on her honeymoon
with her husband?

00:26.714 --> 00:30.684
Did I ever thank you
for rescuing me?

00:30.752 --> 00:32.586
Not yet.

00:32.654 --> 00:35.021
Well...

00:35.089 --> 00:36.489
Thank you.

00:37.158 --> 00:39.426
It's not a problem.

00:45.191 --> 00:46.424
(Truck rumbles)

00:54.132 --> 00:56.032
It's cold up here.

00:56.101 --> 00:57.734
Yeah, I'm so sorry
I had to call you.

00:57.802 --> 00:58.902
I tried grandpa,
but...

00:58.970 --> 01:01.037
don't worry about it.

01:01.106 --> 01:02.839
What're you doing up
in Canmore anyway?

01:02.907 --> 01:04.007
Well, a client hired me

01:04.075 --> 01:05.875
to put some miles
on a young horse.

01:05.943 --> 01:07.577
That horse have
snow tires on?

01:07.644 --> 01:08.777
Amy:
(Laughs)

01:09.980 --> 01:12.982
Too bad you didn't get to keep
that ring of fire truck.

01:13.049 --> 01:14.650
Are you kidding?
I gave it back.

01:14.718 --> 01:16.085
Do you know what it's like
to drive through town

01:16.153 --> 01:18.254
in a big red truck
with flames?

01:18.322 --> 01:20.256
Yeah, I get it.

01:20.324 --> 01:21.790
I had a chance
to win it again.

01:21.858 --> 01:23.558
They invited me back.

01:23.626 --> 01:25.093
What,
to defend your title?

01:25.161 --> 01:27.562
Yeah.
I turned them down though.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.896
How come?

01:28.964 --> 01:30.365
Well, I just...

01:34.103 --> 01:36.138
Yeah, but there's a lot
of money in it.

01:36.205 --> 01:38.039
You know, from now on,
I just wanna work with horses

01:38.107 --> 01:40.007
that really need my help.

01:40.074 --> 01:41.842
Could still use
your own truck though.

01:44.012 --> 01:44.945
You wanna give it
a shot?

01:45.013 --> 01:46.079
Yup.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.816
(Music blasts from earbuds)

01:56.123 --> 01:58.791
Don't stop
on my account.

02:01.695 --> 02:04.364
I have to say,

02:04.431 --> 02:07.400
I am glad you convinced me to
spend more time with Copper.

02:07.468 --> 02:08.768
Well, I'm glad too,
Mallory.

02:08.835 --> 02:10.169
It gives you an excuse
to come out here.

02:10.235 --> 02:12.070
I know you've been
real busy.

02:12.138 --> 02:14.373
Yeah, with everything.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.609
Too busy to stay
for supper?

02:17.677 --> 02:19.278
What's Lou making?

02:19.345 --> 02:20.612
(Laughs)

02:20.680 --> 02:21.846
(Chuckles)

02:22.682 --> 02:23.948
Marnie:
I know it's a little late,

02:24.016 --> 02:25.050
but the closer we get
to my due date,

02:25.117 --> 02:26.517
the more freaked out
Jerry gets.

02:26.585 --> 02:28.319
Lou: Marnie, I am happy
to be your labour coach.

02:28.387 --> 02:30.521
Besides,
it'll be good practice.

02:30.589 --> 02:31.955
Can you believe
that last time

02:32.023 --> 02:33.691
Jerry actually fainted
in the delivery room?

02:33.758 --> 02:35.159
Well,
he may be squeamish.

02:35.227 --> 02:38.929
But at least he's on
the same continent as you.

02:38.997 --> 02:40.565
But Peter knows
your due date.

02:40.632 --> 02:41.865
I'm sure he'll be back
before then.

02:41.933 --> 02:43.333
Yeah, he better be.

02:43.401 --> 02:44.867
Well, if he isn't,

02:44.935 --> 02:47.970
you know you can
count on me.

02:48.038 --> 02:49.606
(Mats flap)

02:50.541 --> 02:53.142
Lou: Okay, sitting nice
and light on the ball,

02:53.211 --> 02:54.811
we're going to find
our pelvis.

02:54.878 --> 02:57.681
Tilt... and tilt,

02:57.748 --> 03:00.516
and forward and back,

03:00.584 --> 03:03.452
and a nice
lateral stretch.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.454
(Phone rings,
Jerry junior giggles)

03:05.522 --> 03:07.055
Jack:
Is anybody gonna get that?

03:07.123 --> 03:09.391
(Toys clatter,
Jack grunts)

03:09.459 --> 03:10.792
(Phone ringing)

03:13.996 --> 03:16.764
Thank you.
Can I have the phone?

03:16.832 --> 03:19.066
Thank you very much.

03:19.134 --> 03:21.168
Hello? Hello!

03:21.237 --> 03:22.237
Marnie:
Oh my God, Jerry!

03:22.304 --> 03:23.404
Grandpa,
are you okay?

03:23.472 --> 03:25.773
Is that the phone?
Was it Peter?

03:25.841 --> 03:27.475
Um, I don't know that.

03:27.543 --> 03:30.510
I didn't get to it
fast enough.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.046
Did he leave a message?

03:35.783 --> 03:37.618
No, it's not Peter.

03:37.685 --> 03:41.020
It's the
Foothills Cowboy Hall of Fame.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.457
Huh.

03:43.524 --> 03:47.593
Apparently, they've got
some kind of news.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.963
Hey, baby,
uh...

03:51.030 --> 03:55.134
I think it's morning there,
or maybe it's dinnertime.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.636
This is getting weird

03:56.703 --> 03:58.604
trying to figure out
the whole time zone thing,

03:58.672 --> 04:00.839
so maybe you could
phone me.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.275
(Vehicle rumbles nearby)

04:03.342 --> 04:05.577
Oh damn!
Bryce! Um...

04:05.645 --> 04:07.879
'Kay, I gotta go.
I love you, Ash.

04:07.946 --> 04:09.013
(Truck rumbles)

04:12.351 --> 04:13.885
Hey, guys.

04:13.952 --> 04:16.654
Look, uh, totally forgot
to tell you, but...

04:16.721 --> 04:18.623
My rodeo buddy, Bryce,
he's looking for someone

04:18.624 --> 04:21.291
<i>to give his roping horse</i>
<i>a leg up so he can sell it.</i>

04:21.358 --> 04:22.827
<i>I said he could come by.</i>

04:22.895 --> 04:24.228
Well, what's wrong
with him?

04:24.296 --> 04:25.930
Nothing, except he's been
standing in a field

04:25.998 --> 04:27.398
for a couple of years.

04:27.465 --> 04:29.500
A horse like that
doesn't need someone like me.

04:29.567 --> 04:31.235
Well, my friend will pay
your rate.

04:31.303 --> 04:32.369
If he's a roper, Caleb,

04:32.437 --> 04:34.071
why doesn't he just do it
himself?

04:34.139 --> 04:36.039
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

04:36.107 --> 04:38.241
Bryce was in Afghanistan.

Lou:
So?

05:53.480 --> 05:54.680
Did you talk
to the Hall of Fame?

05:54.748 --> 05:56.514
Well, I tried
calling them back,

05:56.582 --> 05:58.049
but all I got
was a message,

05:58.117 --> 05:59.985
telling me they're closed
till Monday.

06:00.052 --> 06:02.354
Come on, grandpa,
you know why they called.

06:02.421 --> 06:04.856
I don't wanna jump
to conclusions.

06:04.924 --> 06:06.958
There is only one reason
they would call you now

06:07.026 --> 06:08.159
and you know it.

06:08.227 --> 06:09.594
The Hall of Fame banquet!

06:09.661 --> 06:10.928
<i>What else could it be?</i>

06:10.996 --> 06:12.162
Well, it could be
lots of things.

06:12.230 --> 06:13.830
Mm-mm.

06:13.899 --> 06:17.134
They are going to induct you
into the Hall of Fame,

06:17.202 --> 06:19.436
and it's about time!

06:21.072 --> 06:22.206
I suppose I have paid

06:22.274 --> 06:25.309
my share of dues
all right.

06:28.545 --> 06:31.247
Notches look
pretty worn down,

06:31.315 --> 06:34.683
the incisors are
pretty long...

06:34.751 --> 06:37.287
Lots of angularities,
so...

06:37.354 --> 06:40.023
I'd say nine,
ten years old?

06:40.991 --> 06:43.758
Oh, it's close,
but no cigar.

06:43.826 --> 06:45.127
He's twelve.

06:45.194 --> 06:47.162
I broke him myself
when he was three.

06:47.230 --> 06:48.897
Huh.

06:48.965 --> 06:51.433
<i>Scott:</i> <i>And what about
general</i> <i>body condition?</i>

06:51.500 --> 06:52.834
Is this a test?

06:52.902 --> 06:54.970
You bet it is.

06:55.038 --> 06:56.838
Okay.

06:56.906 --> 07:00.774
Ah, well,
his coat looks pretty good.

07:00.842 --> 07:02.509
He's got a bit of a hay belly.

07:02.577 --> 07:04.645
It's probably from all the
standing around he's been doing.

07:04.712 --> 07:07.281
Yeah, I figure he could use
about a hundred pounds of muscle.

07:07.349 --> 07:08.882
<i>Bryce:</i>
<i>So, adjust his feed,</i>

07:08.951 --> 07:10.284
couple of weeks
with Amy tuning him up

07:10.352 --> 07:12.486
and he's good to go
on the market.

07:12.554 --> 07:14.088
You know, Bryce,

07:14.156 --> 07:15.488
when you see what Amy can do
in just a couple of weeks,

07:15.589 --> 07:17.023
<i>you might wanna reconsider.</i>

07:17.091 --> 07:18.758
It's a nice thought.

07:18.826 --> 07:20.493
But in case you haven't notice, doc,

07:20.561 --> 07:22.228
don't have much use
for a roping horse.

07:22.296 --> 07:24.431
But, hey, you know,
maybe I can sell him to Caleb.

07:24.498 --> 07:27.834
He always pays too much
for his horses.

07:29.570 --> 07:31.236
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Scott.</i>

07:31.304 --> 07:32.938
What were you getting at?

07:33.006 --> 07:34.373
He's pretty atheltic

07:34.441 --> 07:36.275
Do you think he'd be a good
candidate for para-riding?

07:36.343 --> 07:37.642
You got a suggestion?

07:37.743 --> 07:39.744
I don't know.

07:39.779 --> 07:42.848
I have this client
who does <i>paradressage</i>.

07:42.949 --> 07:46.751
It wasn't easy for her,
but I've seen the benefits.

07:46.819 --> 07:49.687
It can be like giving
someone back their legs.

07:55.894 --> 07:58.262
Caleb:
The wife is still in Italy.

07:58.330 --> 07:59.630
Bryce:
You're kidding me!

07:59.698 --> 08:01.299
The young bride went AWOL
on your honeymoon.

08:01.367 --> 08:03.333
Caleb: Well, it's not like that, man.
She's with her mom.

08:03.401 --> 08:04.567
Bryce: - Her mom?!
Caleb: - Yeah.

08:04.635 --> 08:06.236
Bryce:
Oh, that's even worse!

08:06.304 --> 08:09.139
Man, you must be one big hunk
of burning love!

08:09.207 --> 08:10.474
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>Hey, Jack, come here.</i>

08:10.541 --> 08:11.574
I want you to meet
a buddy of mine.

08:11.642 --> 08:13.143
This is Bryce.

08:13.211 --> 08:16.179
Bryce Quinn,
cowboy soldier.

08:16.247 --> 08:17.481
Yes, sir.

08:17.548 --> 08:20.549
Jack Bartlett.
Pleasure to meet you.

08:20.617 --> 08:22.251
I was uh...

08:22.319 --> 08:24.286
Real sorry to hear
about the injury.

08:24.354 --> 08:26.188
We all appreciate
the sacrifice you made.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.491
Well, you know what we say
in the military, Jack?

08:28.558 --> 08:29.725
Adapt and overcome.

08:29.792 --> 08:32.028
Caleb: - Yeah.
Jack: - You bet.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.996
My granddaughter is cooking up
a storm in the kitchen

08:35.063 --> 08:37.932
and it'd be an honour
to have you at our table.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.200
Yes, sir.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.701
Never turn down
a good home-cooked meal.

08:40.769 --> 08:42.236
Me neither.

08:46.007 --> 08:48.042
(Exhales heavily)

08:50.045 --> 08:51.578
- Lou.
- Hey.

08:51.646 --> 08:53.080
Are you busy?
Have a minute?

08:53.148 --> 08:54.214
Yeah.

08:56.784 --> 08:57.984
(Taken aback)
Wow.

08:58.053 --> 08:59.420
I knew you were
pregnant,

08:59.487 --> 09:02.321
but seeing you
like this now, I...

09:02.389 --> 09:03.189
Wow.

09:03.257 --> 09:05.058
It's wow for me too.

09:05.992 --> 09:07.493
So when are you due?

09:07.561 --> 09:09.795
Uh, sixty-one days.

09:09.863 --> 09:11.197
Give or take.

09:11.265 --> 09:13.299
Oh, uh...

09:13.367 --> 09:15.535
Another wow moment.

09:41.159 --> 09:42.293
Too bad.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.760
I was gonna ask you
to stay for dinner.

09:43.828 --> 09:46.263
Oh... maybe next time.

09:46.331 --> 09:48.465
Sure.

09:48.532 --> 09:50.933
Oh, hey, you wanted to talk
to me about something.

09:51.001 --> 09:55.271
Uh, yeah, but...
it's all good.

09:55.339 --> 09:56.772
I'll talk to you later.

10:00.244 --> 10:02.078
(Front door opens)

10:02.146 --> 10:03.413
<i>Bryce:</i> <i>...And I guess when I joined up,</i>

10:03.481 --> 10:05.013
I figured nothing could be
a bigger rush

10:05.081 --> 10:07.416
than eight seconds
on a fire-breathing bronc.

10:07.484 --> 10:08.617
I mean, you know?

10:08.684 --> 10:10.452
Yeah, that's until
you hear gunfire.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.821
Then you realize that, man,
they're shooting at you.

10:12.888 --> 10:15.090
So, Bryce, how did you end up
in a wheelchair?

10:15.158 --> 10:16.858
Mallory!

10:16.926 --> 10:18.460
Oh no, it's okay.

10:18.528 --> 10:20.628
I don't mind talking about it.

10:22.431 --> 10:25.099
It happened
in the middle of the night.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.535
Um, everything was going fine,

10:27.603 --> 10:29.303
until, uh...
I don't know,

10:29.371 --> 10:31.071
somebody threw on
"boot scootin' boogie"

10:31.140 --> 10:33.007
and then the whole place
just went ballistic.

10:34.610 --> 10:36.043
Line dancing accident.

10:36.111 --> 10:38.145
All:
(Playful laughter)

10:42.016 --> 10:43.583
But, hey, enough about me,
okay?

10:43.651 --> 10:45.118
I'd like to hoist a glass
and just thank you all

10:45.186 --> 10:46.486
for inviting me
into your home.

10:46.554 --> 10:47.787
Oh, and while we're at it,

10:47.855 --> 10:49.722
how about a toast
to the newest member

10:49.790 --> 10:52.191
of the Foothills Cowboy
Hall of Fame?

10:52.259 --> 10:54.460
Amy: What? Gran... are you serious?

10:54.528 --> 10:56.228
Way to keep that
under your hat, Jack.

10:56.296 --> 10:57.763
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Stop, stop.</i>

10:57.830 --> 11:00.366
I'm pretty sure that,

11:00.433 --> 11:02.368
well, having a bunch of old
cowboys sing your praises

11:02.435 --> 11:06.071
does not hold a match to
putting your life on the line

11:06.139 --> 11:07.273
to serve your country.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.674
All: Cheers! Right on! To Bryce!

11:09.741 --> 11:11.643
Hey, seeing as I can
still bend my elbow,

11:11.710 --> 11:13.545
I'll raise a glass
to as many toasts

11:13.612 --> 11:15.346
as you care to make.

11:19.685 --> 11:21.052
You know, Bryce,

11:21.119 --> 11:23.288
you can do a lot more
than bend your elbow.

11:23.355 --> 11:25.522
You can totally ride again.

11:25.590 --> 11:28.692
<i>They have these special saddles</i>
<i>and programs, and...</i>

11:28.759 --> 11:30.260
Look, there are riders
who do reining,

11:30.328 --> 11:31.795
some even jump.

11:32.530 --> 11:34.298
There was a Canadian
who won the Olympic gold medal

11:34.365 --> 11:35.832
for para-dressage.

11:37.602 --> 11:39.503
Cheers to them,
whomever they are.

11:42.339 --> 11:43.472
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>(Clears her throat)</i>

11:43.540 --> 11:45.908
There is pumpkin pie
for dessert.

11:45.975 --> 11:47.210
Bryce:
Really?

11:47.277 --> 11:48.344
Let me help you with this.

11:48.412 --> 11:49.445
Lou:
Okay.

11:51.114 --> 11:53.015
You know, Amy.
Um...

11:53.083 --> 11:55.251
I already got a chest
full of medals.

11:55.319 --> 11:56.618
In case you haven't
figured it out yet,

11:56.686 --> 12:00.555
I don't do anything
in a para-assed way.

12:07.697 --> 12:09.097
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Come on, Ty,</i>

12:09.164 --> 12:11.032
you know it would be
the perfect thing for him.

12:12.967 --> 12:14.067
Maybe.

12:14.135 --> 12:14.868
But you were selling
something

12:14.936 --> 12:17.170
he just wasn't buying.

12:17.239 --> 12:18.472
The guy's doing
pretty good,

12:18.540 --> 12:21.375
considering what
he's been through.

12:21.443 --> 12:22.909
I...

12:22.977 --> 12:24.712
I don't know, I just think
there's something going on

12:24.779 --> 12:27.080
behind all the jokes
and that.

12:27.148 --> 12:29.716
The guy's a war vet,
Amy.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.218
He's lost the use
of his legs.

12:32.286 --> 12:35.555
It's not the easiest thing
to deal with.

12:35.623 --> 12:38.124
Maybe you're right.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.359
Coming from you,

12:39.426 --> 12:40.960
I haven't heard that
in a while.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.195
Don't get used to it.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.231
Don't worry,
I won't.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.403
<i>Bryce:</i> <i>Come on, Caleb!</i> <i>Push him!</i>

12:51.471 --> 12:54.139
<i>Come on! Do it!</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

13:00.579 --> 13:02.513
Come on, man! Move it!
You gotta let him go!

13:02.581 --> 13:04.448
Are you kidding?
I am letting him go.

13:04.516 --> 13:06.250
He's got nothing left
in the tank though.

13:06.318 --> 13:07.551
Well, no kidding,

13:07.619 --> 13:08.653
the way you're hanging
on his mouth like that.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.454
Thanks, but I do know
what I'm doing.

13:10.522 --> 13:11.522
That horse knows more
about roping

13:11.590 --> 13:12.823
than you ever will,
okay?

13:12.891 --> 13:14.057
You run down calves
that are bad,

13:14.125 --> 13:15.058
you run down calves
that are good,

13:15.126 --> 13:16.260
it doesn't matter.

13:16.327 --> 13:17.427
He'll get you
where you gotta be

13:17.495 --> 13:18.461
when you gotta be there,
every time.

13:18.529 --> 13:19.796
You can diss me
as much as you want,

13:19.863 --> 13:21.598
but this guy needs
a lot of work.

13:21.666 --> 13:23.900
Yeah, well, so do you,
okay?

13:23.967 --> 13:25.968
I'm not interested in
giving anybody roping lessons.

13:26.036 --> 13:28.638
I'm just...
I wanna sell the horse.

13:33.209 --> 13:35.043
Hey, buddy.
(Laughs)

13:35.111 --> 13:36.345
<i>Hey.</i>

13:36.413 --> 13:38.980
I got no pretzels, man.
I got nothing.

13:39.048 --> 13:40.749
(Laughs)

13:40.817 --> 13:42.918
He loves pretzels.

13:47.890 --> 13:49.324
(Exhales, in thought)

13:49.391 --> 13:52.993
You guys are the pros.
Deal with it.

13:59.535 --> 14:00.968
(Door closes)

14:01.937 --> 14:03.838
Jack, I brought something
for you.

14:03.905 --> 14:05.405
(Impressed whistle)
Smithville.

14:05.473 --> 14:06.540
That's a hat

14:06.607 --> 14:07.774
a man can't help
but admire.

14:07.842 --> 14:09.509
So, do you think you can
spring for a new one?

14:09.577 --> 14:11.144
After all, you're gonna
need a new hat

14:11.212 --> 14:12.479
for that whole theme thing.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.414
What are you,
a travelling salesman?

14:14.482 --> 14:16.216
Well, they're on special
at Maggies

14:16.283 --> 14:18.418
and I make five percent
commission.

14:18.486 --> 14:21.354
Well I already have
a perfectly good hat.

14:21.421 --> 14:23.055
That hat?

14:23.122 --> 14:24.390
Jack, that's your
second best hat,

14:24.458 --> 14:25.725
<i>and I happen to know</i>

14:25.792 --> 14:27.526
your first best hat
is just as pathetic.

14:27.594 --> 14:28.661
That's not true

14:28.729 --> 14:30.095
and a hat like that
costs a fortune.

14:30.163 --> 14:32.665
Well, not when you factor
in the long-term benefits

14:32.733 --> 14:35.133
of quality beaver fur felt

14:35.201 --> 14:36.868
with a classic
cattleman's crease

14:36.935 --> 14:39.070
made by hand.

14:40.205 --> 14:41.539
Come on, Jack,
just try it on.

14:41.607 --> 14:42.807
It's your size.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.509
How do you know
how big my head is?

14:44.577 --> 14:46.678
Everyone knows
you have a big head, Jack.

14:47.880 --> 14:48.946
Give me that.

14:59.223 --> 15:00.524
Not too shabby.

15:02.627 --> 15:04.294
So what do you say?

15:09.500 --> 15:11.834
Amy, I think
it's a great idea.

15:11.902 --> 15:14.136
But I'm not sure
our insurance covers

15:14.204 --> 15:16.305
working with a disabled rider
off property,

15:16.373 --> 15:19.375
so just let me look
into it first, okay?

15:19.443 --> 15:20.910
<i>Ty:</i> <i>You know, Amy,</i>
<i>sometimes when a guy says</i>

15:20.977 --> 15:22.244
he wants to sell his horse,

15:22.312 --> 15:23.713
it's because he wants
to sell his horse.

15:23.781 --> 15:25.781
I don't think this is
one of those times.

15:25.848 --> 15:26.948
Well, he seemed
pretty sure about it

15:27.016 --> 15:28.383
at dinner
the other night.

15:28.451 --> 15:29.718
You guys didn't see
the connection he had

15:29.786 --> 15:32.020
with his horse, okay?

15:32.087 --> 15:35.457
Look, I'm just trying to give
the guy some options.

15:35.525 --> 15:37.191
Okay.

15:37.259 --> 15:40.028
Scott said you wouldn't
give this up, so...

15:43.331 --> 15:45.299
What is that?

15:45.366 --> 15:46.834
It's the number
of the para-dressage rider

15:46.902 --> 15:48.536
he told you about.

15:48.603 --> 15:50.170
Lauren Barwick?

15:51.105 --> 15:54.442
Are you kidding me?
This is Scott's client?

15:54.509 --> 15:56.410
Ty, she is an Olympic
gold medalist.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.378
She... oh, thank you so much!

15:59.447 --> 16:00.847
Thank you.

16:01.916 --> 16:03.817
Scott said you'd get around
to calling her sooner or later.

16:03.884 --> 16:04.951
(Laughing)

16:08.656 --> 16:11.190
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Hello there,</i>
<i>this is Jack Bartlett calling.</i>

16:11.258 --> 16:13.391
I got your message
and...

16:15.562 --> 16:17.930
Of course.
Oh, I know, next week.

16:17.997 --> 16:19.465
I remember.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.033
Uh-huh...

16:23.336 --> 16:24.402
Yeah.

16:26.405 --> 16:27.873
Oh, okay...

16:29.575 --> 16:32.543
Sure, sure.

16:32.611 --> 16:36.080
Uh, no, no.
It's a terrific honour.

16:36.982 --> 16:37.949
<i>No. Thank you.</i>

16:38.016 --> 16:39.316
(Phone beeps off)

16:39.384 --> 16:41.786
So, what did they say?

16:42.855 --> 16:44.088
(Laughs)

16:44.155 --> 16:47.290
It's not quite
what I expected.

16:48.793 --> 16:50.159
Well, it turns out,

16:50.227 --> 16:54.397
I'm not being inducted
into the Hall of Fame.

16:54.465 --> 16:56.533
(Sighs)
That is not fair!

16:56.601 --> 16:59.135
Well, not this year
anyway.

16:59.203 --> 17:02.404
Grandpa, you must be
so disappointed.

17:02.472 --> 17:04.172
Well,
what did they want?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.876
Well, they want me
to make a speech...

17:06.943 --> 17:09.845
Introducing this year's
inductee.

17:10.747 --> 17:12.446
This year's inductee?

17:12.516 --> 17:13.648
And who the hell

17:13.717 --> 17:14.849
does that bunch
of over-the-hill cowboys

17:14.917 --> 17:18.219
think is more deserving
than Jack Bartlett?

17:18.286 --> 17:20.221
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Hey, Jack? Jack!</i>

17:20.288 --> 17:22.189
Hey!

17:22.257 --> 17:24.492
So, did you hear the news?
Isn't it great?

17:24.560 --> 17:26.260
Yeah.
You happy for me?

17:26.328 --> 17:27.795
(Chuckles)

17:27.863 --> 17:30.264
I'm happy, Tim.
I'm, I'm ecstatic.

17:30.332 --> 17:32.033
Yeah, me too.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.467
Me too.
I'm ecstatic.

17:35.570 --> 17:36.770
You know, I just can't help
but wonder

17:36.838 --> 17:39.139
who's gonna induct me.
That's...

17:39.206 --> 17:41.441
I mean, the obvious choice
would be Porky Simpson, right?

17:41.509 --> 17:44.310
He's been our MP for what,
half a century?

17:44.378 --> 17:46.279
<i>I mean, you tell him two men</i>
<i>and a dog are gonna show up</i>

17:46.347 --> 17:48.681
he'll give a speech.

17:48.749 --> 17:50.016
But I'm kinda gunning

17:50.083 --> 17:51.350
somebody big,
somebody new,

17:51.418 --> 17:52.685
somebody hot.

17:53.754 --> 17:55.521
Not some old cowboy
they gotta dust off,

17:55.589 --> 17:57.023
prop up on the podium...

17:57.090 --> 17:59.358
It's me, dammit!

17:59.426 --> 18:01.661
It's me.
They asked me.

18:01.728 --> 18:03.195
- You?
- That's right.

18:04.130 --> 18:05.163
They must be scraping

18:05.230 --> 18:07.599
the bottom of the barrel
this year.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.835
I'm just kidding you, Jack.
Come on.

18:10.903 --> 18:13.471
Hey, I think it's great.

18:15.074 --> 18:18.476
Keeping it all
in the family, huh?

18:22.527 --> 18:25.429
Taking the arms up
as we inhale...

18:26.363 --> 18:29.965
Fill your lungs with oxygen
for your baby...

18:30.901 --> 18:32.101
Is J.J. okay?

18:32.169 --> 18:33.169
It's okay, Lou.

18:33.236 --> 18:34.637
Toddlers do stuff.

18:34.705 --> 18:37.006
Just inhale, relax.
Whatever.

18:37.073 --> 18:38.274
I'm sorry,

18:38.342 --> 18:39.709
I've been way too uptight
lately...

18:39.777 --> 18:41.210
About pretty much everything.

18:41.278 --> 18:42.711
(Inhales)

18:42.779 --> 18:44.713
How am I ever going to learn
to be a good mom like you

18:44.781 --> 18:47.882
if I can't relax
around children?

18:47.950 --> 18:49.184
<i>What is J.J. Playing with?</i>

18:49.251 --> 18:50.885
Forget about Jerry,
Lou.

18:51.887 --> 18:53.888
Now, close your eyes.

18:53.956 --> 18:55.023
<i>Inhale.</i>

18:57.293 --> 18:58.726
This is better.

18:58.794 --> 19:00.093
Definitely.

19:01.095 --> 19:04.432
(Huge clatter, objects smash,
Lou gasps)

19:04.499 --> 19:08.068
(J.J. Cries
and Marnie stammers awkwardly)

19:09.371 --> 19:12.206
(Orchestral music plays)

19:17.545 --> 19:19.579
What're we doing here
again?

19:19.647 --> 19:20.847
I told you,

19:20.914 --> 19:23.282
there's something
that I want you to see.

19:23.351 --> 19:24.751
Bryce:
Well, right now,

19:24.819 --> 19:27.019
all I'm seeing is some gal
on a Dressage horse.

19:30.357 --> 19:31.923
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Her name is Lauren barwick.</i>

19:31.991 --> 19:33.726
The horse is named Manny.

19:33.793 --> 19:36.595
So, what you're saying
is you wanna retrain Bandit

19:36.663 --> 19:38.397
to become some sort
of fancy dancing horse?

19:40.132 --> 19:41.700
<i>Gimme a break.</i>

19:41.768 --> 19:45.003
Amy: No. I just, I wanted
you to see what she can do.

19:45.071 --> 19:46.271
(Hooves thud)

20:02.553 --> 20:04.454
She's paralyzed?

20:05.390 --> 20:06.456
Yeah.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.759
And she won a
gold medal in Beijing.

20:13.498 --> 20:15.632
<i>You wanna meet her?</i>

20:23.039 --> 20:25.307
Hey, Lauren,
this is Bryce.

20:25.375 --> 20:26.675
Hey, Lauren.

20:26.743 --> 20:30.546
Hi. Amy tells me you were
quite the rodeo cowboy.

20:30.614 --> 20:32.281
Ah, not so much anymore.

20:32.348 --> 20:34.883
And you wanna ride again?

20:34.950 --> 20:37.585
No. Actually,
I just wanna sell my horse.

20:40.623 --> 20:42.990
I can imagine
how you feel.

20:43.058 --> 20:44.592
After my accident,

20:44.660 --> 20:46.861
because of the level of riding
that I'd achieved,

20:46.929 --> 20:49.431
I never wanted
to ride again.

20:50.365 --> 20:51.632
And then one day,

20:51.699 --> 20:54.468
I was watching someone
ride my horse,

20:54.536 --> 20:58.204
and it was the worst
experience ever.

21:00.207 --> 21:04.177
I knew nobody could ride her
like I could.

21:04.245 --> 21:07.747
Yeah, I know exactly
what you mean.

21:16.457 --> 21:17.857
Okay, great.

21:17.925 --> 21:20.225
Yeah, thanks for getting
back to me so quickly.

21:20.293 --> 21:23.662
Okay, so Western Financial
Group has agreed

21:23.729 --> 21:24.863
to extend our coverage

21:24.931 --> 21:26.631
so that you can work
with Bryce.

21:26.699 --> 21:27.899
But this time,

21:27.967 --> 21:29.233
please make sure
he signs a waiver.

21:29.301 --> 21:30.569
Okay.

21:30.636 --> 21:34.105
Oh, careful,
that's grandpa's speech.

21:35.675 --> 21:37.141
Pretty short speech.

21:37.209 --> 21:38.542
Date of birth,
question mark.

21:38.610 --> 21:40.644
Married Marion Bartlett
1983.

21:40.712 --> 21:42.145
All-around cowboy...

21:42.213 --> 21:44.615
'85, '86,
question mark.

21:44.683 --> 21:48.819
Big River Ranch, 601 acres,
question mark.

21:48.887 --> 21:50.788
Wow. This is giving me
tingles.

21:50.856 --> 21:53.423
Yeah,
it's a work in progress.

21:53.492 --> 21:54.724
But it can't be easy
for grandpa

21:54.792 --> 21:56.392
to say something nice
about dad.

21:56.460 --> 21:57.861
I mean, come on,

21:57.928 --> 22:00.997
he was really hoping
it would be him this year.

22:01.064 --> 22:02.532
Caleb:
Oh, do you need a hand, Bryce?

22:02.600 --> 22:03.800
Bryce: Hey, come on, man, back off.

22:03.868 --> 22:05.869
I can get up the damn ramp.

22:05.936 --> 22:07.036
Sorry.

22:07.104 --> 22:08.237
Bryce:
See, I got it.

22:08.305 --> 22:10.339
Caleb:
Well, there you are.

22:21.250 --> 22:22.885
Caleb: All right, man,
toss you up on three.

22:22.952 --> 22:24.686
Why don't you just move?

22:24.754 --> 22:26.221
You drop me,
I'll break both your legs.

22:26.288 --> 22:29.690
Caleb: I'll be careful.
One, two... three!

22:29.758 --> 22:33.093
Ty, Bryce and Caleb:
(Grunts of effort)

22:35.296 --> 22:37.297
Caleb:
I got you, buddy.

22:37.365 --> 22:38.432
All right.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.601
<i>Are you on?</i>

22:43.270 --> 22:44.504
Caleb:
Thanks, Amy.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.072
Okay, you got both feet
in the stirrups?

22:46.140 --> 22:47.908
Bryce:
Yup.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.809
Okay.
How does that feel?

22:49.877 --> 22:52.378
I'm paralyzed,
I don't feel anything.

22:52.446 --> 22:53.813
Okay, you don't gotta
keep grabbing me, okay?

22:53.881 --> 22:55.682
Okay, Caleb, move.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.483
I got your back,
all right?

22:57.552 --> 22:58.918
Doesn't make me feel
any better.

22:58.985 --> 23:02.320
Okay, we're just gonna walk,
all right?

23:03.256 --> 23:04.189
Ty:
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

23:04.257 --> 23:05.624
(Grunts of effort)

23:05.692 --> 23:07.693
Caleb: I got ya. You all right, buddy?

23:07.761 --> 23:09.595
Bryce: You know what?
You can get me off now.

23:09.663 --> 23:11.063
This is too much
of a good thing, you know?

23:11.130 --> 23:13.532
Amy: - Are you sure?
Bryce: - Yeah, yeah.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.332
All right?
Just right now, okay?

23:15.400 --> 23:17.635
Ty: - Okay, we'll just...
Bryce: - Please?

23:17.703 --> 23:19.236
Amy:
Bryce, wait.

23:19.304 --> 23:20.872
Look, this is something that
we all have to get used to.

23:20.940 --> 23:22.239
We're new at it,
we just need practice.

23:22.307 --> 23:23.374
Look, you're gonna have
to practice without me.

23:23.442 --> 23:24.642
As far as I'm concerned,

23:24.710 --> 23:26.210
I should've never
let you talk me into this.

23:26.278 --> 23:28.179
Amy: Bryce, look, this is
gonna get easier, okay?

23:28.246 --> 23:29.681
Do you have any idea
how long it took me

23:29.748 --> 23:31.347
to forget about horses?

23:31.415 --> 23:33.216
To stop thinking
about roping?

23:33.284 --> 23:35.586
To get my head out of rodeo
and into this chair?

23:37.956 --> 23:39.556
So, thank you.

23:39.624 --> 23:41.324
Thank you for bringing it
all back.

23:51.370 --> 23:58.022
<i>And then Tim went on to win</i>
<i>the Nelson Lake rodeo in 1986.</i>

23:58.496 --> 24:01.265
Or was that '84?

24:02.234 --> 24:04.168
Eighty-five?

24:04.236 --> 24:05.269
(Grumbles)

24:07.547 --> 24:08.980
Whatcha doing?

24:09.173 --> 24:10.465
Working on your speech?

24:10.470 --> 24:12.718
I really don't know
how to start this thing,

24:12.785 --> 24:14.519
or finish it
for that matter.

24:14.587 --> 24:18.155
The middle... that's where
it really falls apart.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.891
Grampa, okay,
I have an idea,

24:20.959 --> 24:21.892
now listen.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.761
Close your eyes...

24:24.663 --> 24:25.730
Go on.

24:26.898 --> 24:28.600
And picture dad.

24:28.667 --> 24:31.968
Now what is the first word
that pops into your mind?

24:32.036 --> 24:33.169
Hm.

24:33.238 --> 24:33.930
Got it?

24:33.938 --> 24:34.970
- Yeah.
- What is it?

24:34.972 --> 24:37.774
Nothing I can say
in front of you.

24:37.842 --> 24:41.411
Keep working on it,
it'll come to you.

24:41.479 --> 24:43.213
(Inhales and exhales)

24:44.115 --> 24:45.848
Yeah.

24:45.915 --> 24:47.783
Bryce: So the gal used to be
a Dallas cowboy cheerleader.

24:47.851 --> 24:48.917
Ty:
Come on.

24:48.985 --> 24:50.185
Bryce:
No, seriously, dude.

24:50.254 --> 24:51.487
If you'd seen her?
No, you'd believe it.

24:51.555 --> 24:53.088
Okay, so she tells me
she she's got a thing

24:53.156 --> 24:54.557
for rodeo guys.

24:54.625 --> 24:57.092
Only problem is she's
got a friend, right?

24:57.160 --> 24:59.295
So I pry Caleb away
from his beer,

24:59.363 --> 25:01.029
and I set him up
with the friend.

25:01.097 --> 25:02.530
Nice.
Another cheerleader?

25:02.598 --> 25:03.598
Linebacker.

25:03.666 --> 25:04.733
(Laughs)
What?

25:05.701 --> 25:06.735
So that was Caleb,

25:06.802 --> 25:08.603
my trusty wingman, right?

25:08.671 --> 25:10.071
I'd get set up
with the hottie

25:10.139 --> 25:11.873
and he'd get set up
with the linebacker friend.

25:11.940 --> 25:13.408
Yeah,
well times have changed.

25:13.476 --> 25:15.243
I have a hot little wife now.
Thank you.

25:15.311 --> 25:16.645
<i>Bryce:</i> <i>And she's still</i>
<i>on the honeymoon...</i>

25:16.712 --> 25:17.978
with her mom.

25:18.045 --> 25:18.979
Yeah, what's going on
with that, man?

25:19.046 --> 25:20.648
Everything's fine.

25:21.616 --> 25:23.049
(Sighs) I...

25:23.117 --> 25:24.851
It's embarrassing, okay.

25:24.919 --> 25:27.988
She won't even tell me
when she's coming home.

25:28.055 --> 25:29.356
Sorry, dude.

25:29.424 --> 25:31.057
Hey, listen, if it makes you
feel any better,

25:31.125 --> 25:33.693
my girl and I split when I
got out of the hospital.

25:33.761 --> 25:36.195
Brutal.
She just up and left?

25:36.263 --> 25:37.697
Whoa, no,
she never left me.

25:37.765 --> 25:39.064
I dumped her.

25:39.132 --> 25:40.600
<i>Man, she was getting</i>
<i>on my nerves.</i>

25:40.668 --> 25:41.867
It was like she was always
trying to play nurse.

25:41.935 --> 25:43.536
And you know what? not once

25:43.604 --> 25:45.538
did she offer to put on one of
those sexy little white uniforms

25:45.606 --> 25:47.907
you know, not once!

25:47.974 --> 25:49.341
I'm serious!

25:49.409 --> 25:50.342
Anyone need another beer?

25:50.410 --> 25:52.778
I'll get 'em,
I'll get 'em.

25:52.845 --> 25:55.781
You think the cripple
can't get his own beer?

25:55.848 --> 25:57.215
(Beer bottle clanks)

25:57.283 --> 25:59.318
Ty: - Here.
Bryce: - Seriously.

26:00.219 --> 26:02.153
Or open the damn thing?

26:02.221 --> 26:04.122
Ty:
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, man!

26:04.190 --> 26:05.323
Okay! Let go!

26:06.958 --> 26:08.859
You trying to brake
my arm, man?

26:08.927 --> 26:11.895
Oh yeah, what're you
gonna do about it?

26:13.031 --> 26:15.366
You gonna hit me?

26:15.434 --> 26:17.335
Come on, hit me.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.037
Hit me!

26:22.873 --> 26:24.106
(Laughs)

26:26.276 --> 26:27.444
Come on, man.

26:27.511 --> 26:30.447
I'm just yankin' your
chain, dude.

26:30.514 --> 26:31.815
(Laughs awkwardly)

26:31.882 --> 26:34.684
You should've seen
the look on your face.

26:34.752 --> 26:37.320
Yeah, you really
had me going.

26:39.322 --> 26:40.389
(Laughing)

26:42.258 --> 26:43.559
(Rooster crows)

26:48.331 --> 26:49.598
Something wrong
with the hat, Jack?

26:49.666 --> 26:51.166
Yeah.
I wanna return it.

26:51.234 --> 26:52.568
But the Gala,
the Hall of Fame.

26:52.635 --> 26:55.670
Well, it turns out
it's not my year.

26:55.738 --> 26:57.538
Really?
I'm sorry to hear that,

26:57.606 --> 26:59.340
but you can't take
the hat back.

26:59.408 --> 27:01.041
You're telling me
I can't return a hat

27:01.109 --> 27:02.477
I haven't even worn?

27:02.544 --> 27:04.545
Unfortunately that is exactly
what I'm saying.

27:04.613 --> 27:06.814
Although Maggie's does have
a generous return policy,

27:06.882 --> 27:08.850
it does not include headwear,
footwear or underwear.

27:08.917 --> 27:10.183
Why the hell not?

27:10.251 --> 27:12.753
Public health issue.
Just can't do it.

27:12.820 --> 27:14.821
You'll find a way.

27:15.790 --> 27:18.425
What about my commission?

27:23.498 --> 27:24.598
Hey.

27:25.499 --> 27:27.132
Good morning.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.269
(Exhales heavily)
Rough night?

27:30.336 --> 27:33.939
(Sighs) Yeah, I was out
with Caleb and Bryce.

27:34.007 --> 27:37.476
I'm sure Bryce had some
nice things to say about me.

27:37.544 --> 27:38.977
What do you mean?

27:39.045 --> 27:41.146
He just kinda lost it
on me yesterday.

27:41.214 --> 27:43.281
I was just trying
to help him.

27:43.348 --> 27:44.549
Well, Bryce makes it
pretty clear

27:44.617 --> 27:46.718
he doesn't want
anybody's help...

27:46.786 --> 27:47.819
Ever.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.961
Okay, I want you to try
something for me, all right?

27:57.029 --> 27:58.796
Be a good boy.

28:00.264 --> 28:01.364
I know.

28:01.433 --> 28:04.134
Okay, Bandit,
that's good.

28:05.069 --> 28:06.202
All right.

28:07.405 --> 28:10.674
Gimme your head,
you can do it.

28:10.742 --> 28:12.843
Come on.
Good boy.

28:14.645 --> 28:17.046
Now this is supposed
to give you some relief

28:17.113 --> 28:19.549
once the labour pains
really kick in.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.350
Yeah, you can skip it,

28:21.418 --> 28:22.718
when the labor pain kicks in,

28:22.786 --> 28:24.554
I'm pretty sure I'll be
asking for an epidural

28:24.621 --> 28:25.521
not a tennis ball.

28:25.589 --> 28:26.889
An epidural?

28:26.957 --> 28:29.258
You, Ms. everything-needs-
to-be-natural?

28:29.326 --> 28:31.326
Yeah, tried that first time
around.

28:31.393 --> 28:32.661
First you breathe
through the pain,

28:32.728 --> 28:33.895
then you scream through it

28:33.963 --> 28:36.331
and then you ask
for pain killers.

28:36.398 --> 28:38.066
Trust me,
you will too.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.835
Well look, I know you've
been through this before

28:39.902 --> 28:41.770
and you know more than I do.

28:41.838 --> 28:43.505
But I want a natural birth

28:43.573 --> 28:45.139
and I'm sticking to it.

28:45.207 --> 28:46.707
Okay, look,
it's like I was saying:

28:46.775 --> 28:48.308
Life doesn't always
go to plan.

28:48.376 --> 28:50.077
Sometimes you just have to
learn how to go with the flow

28:50.144 --> 28:51.178
and...

28:54.349 --> 28:56.216
Oh my God.

28:56.284 --> 28:57.518
Oh my God!

28:58.487 --> 29:00.253
My water broke.

29:01.422 --> 29:02.822
Marnie: Oh, okay, Jerry. I'll...

29:02.890 --> 29:04.958
I'll meet on the sixth floor.
Bring my suitcase.

29:05.025 --> 29:06.493
Well, uh...

29:06.560 --> 29:07.894
Marnie, I thought I was gonna
be your labour coach?

29:07.962 --> 29:09.529
It's okay.

29:09.597 --> 29:10.997
Jerry's thinks he'll be able
to stay conscious this time.

29:11.064 --> 29:12.231
He brought smelling salts.

29:12.299 --> 29:13.600
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

29:13.667 --> 29:14.701
Are you sure you're okay
with Jerry junior?

29:14.768 --> 29:16.102
Yeah. We're okay.

29:16.169 --> 29:17.403
Oh, good luck.

29:17.471 --> 29:20.005
Marnie: - Yeah. Yup.
Lou: - We'll be fine.

29:20.072 --> 29:21.807
We'll be good.

29:22.709 --> 29:24.710
Right, buddy?
We're gonna be good.

29:24.777 --> 29:25.944
No.

29:26.012 --> 29:28.079
Yeah, we're gonna be good.
Right?

29:28.147 --> 29:29.247
No.

29:30.416 --> 29:31.617
You're here
'cause you're gonna try

29:31.684 --> 29:33.918
and get me back up
on Bandit, right?

29:33.986 --> 29:35.419
I've been working
with him.

29:35.487 --> 29:36.521
Okay. I think I've made
it easier

29:36.588 --> 29:39.323
for you to be able
to ride him.

29:39.391 --> 29:40.892
You never quit, do you?

29:40.959 --> 29:42.393
Look, I'm sorry, Amy,

29:42.460 --> 29:43.628
I'm still not interested
in this.

29:43.695 --> 29:44.695
I just want you
to train the horse

29:44.763 --> 29:45.796
so I can sell him,
all right?

29:45.864 --> 29:47.264
He's ready.
Okay?

29:47.332 --> 29:48.900
And I've got a whole list
of potential buyers

29:48.967 --> 29:50.567
coming to see him
this afternoon.

29:50.635 --> 29:52.235
Good.
That's great.

29:52.302 --> 29:53.369
Good.

29:54.906 --> 29:56.205
You know what I think, Bryce?

29:56.273 --> 29:59.075
(Sighs annoyed)
I wouldn't hazard a guess.

29:59.143 --> 30:00.744
I think you don't wanna
lose that horse.

30:00.811 --> 30:02.478
Yeah?

30:02.547 --> 30:04.380
You know what? I'm gonna
give you one last shot.

30:04.448 --> 30:08.417
Okay. You come by the arena
this afternoon at three.

30:08.484 --> 30:10.085
Or what?

30:10.153 --> 30:12.087
Or I'll show Bandit
to those buyers.

30:12.155 --> 30:13.589
And I'm sure one of them
will be more than happy

30:13.657 --> 30:16.491
to take him off your hands.

30:20.129 --> 30:21.196
(Door closes)

30:22.130 --> 30:23.531
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Jack?</i>

30:24.567 --> 30:25.633
Hey, Jack?

30:25.701 --> 30:27.134
Hey.

30:27.202 --> 30:28.302
I, uh...

30:28.370 --> 30:30.137
Oh, look at you.
Hard at it.

30:31.640 --> 30:32.974
Or hardly at it.

30:33.042 --> 30:33.808
You do know the banquet's
tonight, right?

30:33.876 --> 30:36.377
I'm well aware,
thank you.

30:36.445 --> 30:38.511
Now if you don't mind.

30:40.414 --> 30:42.482
I brought you
my scrapbook.

30:42.550 --> 30:45.351
I thought it might, you know,
stir up some memories,

30:45.419 --> 30:47.621
<i>beef up the speech a bit,</i> <i>or...</i>

30:47.689 --> 30:49.322
Or maybe get you started.

30:50.257 --> 30:52.492
(Grunts)
Flip it open.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.096
<i>Okay, right there.</i>

30:57.163 --> 30:58.898
All 'round cowboy,
Grand Prairie.

30:58.966 --> 30:59.865
Mmm.

30:59.933 --> 31:01.533
Okay.
Flip the page.

31:02.468 --> 31:04.135
<i>Remember that?</i>
<i>That was night train.</i>

31:04.203 --> 31:05.937
<i>I was the only guy to ride</i>
<i>that bad boy for eight seconds.</i>

31:06.005 --> 31:07.371
Flip the page.

31:08.340 --> 31:10.208
There we go.
Ponoka.

31:10.275 --> 31:12.243
<i>Remember I broke</i>
<i>the record there?</i>

31:12.311 --> 31:13.845
<i>That was the day.</i>

31:13.913 --> 31:15.080
Look...

31:15.147 --> 31:17.281
Tim, I can't just stand
up there

31:17.349 --> 31:19.917
and list off
how many buckles you won.

31:19.985 --> 31:21.685
Oh, you jealous?

31:21.753 --> 31:23.020
Why, 'cause I won more
than you?

31:23.088 --> 31:24.287
Oh, you're keeping score?

31:24.355 --> 31:26.156
Oh, like you didn't?

31:27.092 --> 31:28.859
If you have it all
figured out,

31:28.927 --> 31:30.928
why don't you
just take your book,

31:30.996 --> 31:33.997
and write your own
damn speech?

31:34.064 --> 31:36.265
You're disappointed.

31:38.201 --> 31:39.535
Nah, I get it,

31:39.603 --> 31:42.639
I'm being inducted
and you're not.

31:42.706 --> 31:44.040
Nah, I get it.

31:44.108 --> 31:47.844
I just thought you might
be bigger about it.

31:47.911 --> 31:49.978
Oh well,
stick with it.

31:50.046 --> 31:51.279
I'll leave that for you,

31:51.347 --> 31:53.682
and I'll see you tonight.

31:54.984 --> 31:56.384
It's a big night!

31:58.554 --> 32:00.255
Amy:
(Sighs heavily)

32:08.797 --> 32:12.299
Sorry, Bandit.
He's not gonna show.

32:14.703 --> 32:17.504
Okay,
what am I doing here?

32:21.342 --> 32:23.910
(Reigns clatter,
hooves clomp)

32:28.149 --> 32:29.448
Amy:
Good boy.

32:31.552 --> 32:32.752
Good boy.

32:34.689 --> 32:36.455
Okay.
That's pretty cool.

32:37.357 --> 32:39.624
How's that help me?

32:39.693 --> 32:41.226
Come on over here.

32:48.634 --> 32:49.802
All right, Bryce,

32:49.869 --> 32:51.770
bring your chair
as close as you can.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.876
Now when you're ready,
you climb up there.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.317
Bryce:
(Grunts of effort)

33:06.384 --> 33:07.484
Amy:
Whoa...

33:11.488 --> 33:12.655
(Clears throat)

33:18.529 --> 33:20.797
Now get yourself centered.

33:27.270 --> 33:29.972
(Bandit snuffles,
Bryce exhales)

33:35.779 --> 33:36.846
Huh.

33:36.913 --> 33:38.814
Amy and Bryce:
(Laugh)

33:41.118 --> 33:42.350
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Good boy.</i>

33:43.285 --> 33:44.352
Hey, buddy.

33:46.789 --> 33:48.123
Okay, now what?

33:50.325 --> 33:52.060
(Pleased laughter)

33:52.128 --> 33:53.161
That's it.

33:58.933 --> 34:00.000
(Chuckles)

34:01.557 --> 34:03.458
<i>Whoa, atta boy, Bandit.</i>

34:03.525 --> 34:04.860
Atta boy.

34:04.927 --> 34:06.427
Okay, good boy.

34:06.495 --> 34:07.262
Whoa.

34:07.330 --> 34:08.463
Okay, that's good.

34:08.530 --> 34:09.664
Now just keep him going
with your voice.

34:09.732 --> 34:11.399
Shouldn't one of us
be spotting him?

34:11.467 --> 34:12.867
Just give him a chance.

34:12.934 --> 34:15.502
Just like old times,
eh, buddy?

34:15.570 --> 34:18.239
Caleb. He doesn't need you
to save him, okay.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.072
(Laughter)

34:19.139 --> 34:20.007
That looks great.

34:20.074 --> 34:21.775
Now just go easy,

34:21.842 --> 34:24.311
<i>this is your first time out.</i>

34:24.379 --> 34:26.746
Yeah, I never could
take it slow.

34:26.813 --> 34:27.880
Hoo! Whoa.

34:28.782 --> 34:30.149
Caleb:
Bryce!

34:30.217 --> 34:31.550
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

34:31.618 --> 34:32.685
Aaagh!

34:33.987 --> 34:35.487
Caleb and Amy:
Bryce!

34:36.389 --> 34:37.523
Are you okay?

34:37.591 --> 34:39.025
Agh.
There's something's wrong.

34:39.092 --> 34:41.560
(Panting)
I can't feel my legs...

34:44.197 --> 34:45.597
(Laughs)

34:46.498 --> 34:48.433
That was frkikin' awesome!

34:48.501 --> 34:49.501
Let's go again.

34:49.568 --> 34:50.601
(Grunts)

34:54.274 --> 34:56.174
Lou: (Gasps)
A baby girl!

34:57.076 --> 35:00.111
Jerry,
I'm so happy for you.

35:00.178 --> 35:02.413
Grampa, it's a girl.

35:03.648 --> 35:07.751
Yeah. No, I don't mind taking
care of Jerry Jr. at all.

35:07.819 --> 35:10.087
As long as you need.

35:10.155 --> 35:11.822
No, it's no trouble.

35:11.890 --> 35:13.657
Yeah.

35:13.725 --> 35:14.758
Okay, all right.

35:14.826 --> 35:17.627
Talk to you soon, Jerry.
Bye.

35:17.694 --> 35:19.429
Grampa, you so don't
need to do that.

35:19.496 --> 35:20.696
I will clean everything up.

35:20.764 --> 35:22.765
I'm so sorry
about this mess.

35:22.833 --> 35:25.035
Oh, I don't mind, Lou.

35:25.102 --> 35:28.104
You go put that little guy
down for a nap.

35:28.172 --> 35:29.605
And I'll take care
of this.

35:29.673 --> 35:31.541
Thank you so much.

35:34.411 --> 35:35.777
Oh, no. Not the...

35:36.612 --> 35:39.315
<i>Oh, Tim is gonna love you,</i> <i>little guy.</i>

35:47.557 --> 35:48.656
(Front door opens)

35:50.559 --> 35:52.026
(Door closes)

35:52.094 --> 35:53.861
- Hey, Jack.
- Hi, Scott.

35:53.929 --> 35:56.264
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Be a good boy now. No don't...</i>

35:57.899 --> 35:59.467
<i>J.J.:</i>
<i>(Whining)</i>

36:00.169 --> 36:02.603
But you're supposed to stay
in there and sleep, honey.

36:02.671 --> 36:04.471
Oh... you won't...

36:04.538 --> 36:06.373
You won't stay in there
will you?

36:06.441 --> 36:08.641
Ugh. I know you won't.

36:08.709 --> 36:11.211
'Cause you want your mommy, right?

36:11.279 --> 36:13.413
I know you want your mommy
and she's coming back soon,

36:13.481 --> 36:14.781
<i>okay, buddy?</i>

36:14.849 --> 36:16.816
<i>She's coming soon,</i>
<i>i promise.</i>

36:16.884 --> 36:17.717
(Groans)
I promise.

36:17.785 --> 36:18.685
(Whines)
No.

36:18.752 --> 36:20.052
Oh hey.
Come on in.

36:20.988 --> 36:22.455
Look at this place.

36:22.522 --> 36:24.590
It's a baby paradise.

36:24.657 --> 36:26.125
Yeah.

36:26.193 --> 36:27.393
Hope I'm not interrupting
anything.

36:27.461 --> 36:29.161
Oh no, the only thing
you're interrupting

36:29.229 --> 36:33.265
is my complete failure
to do anything maternal.

36:34.301 --> 36:35.368
May I?

36:36.303 --> 36:38.203
Okay.
Hey, big guy.

36:38.270 --> 36:39.505
You want to see
something cool?

36:39.572 --> 36:41.172
J.J.:
Oh.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.108
<i>Scott:</i> <i>Yeah, you wanna
see</i> <i>something cool?</i>

36:43.175 --> 36:44.543
Look, you know why ponies
are cool?

36:44.611 --> 36:46.311
- A horsey!
- They can sleep standing up.

36:46.379 --> 36:47.546
Like this.

36:47.614 --> 36:49.080
And they just close
their eyes

36:49.148 --> 36:52.183
and dream about cows
and chickens

36:52.251 --> 36:54.184
and little kittens
sleeping in the barn loft.

36:54.252 --> 36:55.285
J.J.:
- barn lo

36:55.353 --> 36:57.655
You make that
look so easy.

36:57.723 --> 37:00.357
You're really good
with kids.

37:00.425 --> 37:03.027
Well, had some practice.

37:04.329 --> 37:06.096
I've been seeing someone.

37:06.164 --> 37:08.232
She has a three year old.

37:08.299 --> 37:09.533
That's great.

37:10.467 --> 37:12.736
How long have you guys
been seeing each other?

37:12.803 --> 37:14.738
A little over a month.

37:15.672 --> 37:17.506
At first I wasn't too sure
about the kid thing,

37:17.574 --> 37:20.509
but now I'm crazy
for them both.

37:21.811 --> 37:23.979
Well, I'm really happy
for you.

37:24.047 --> 37:25.447
Thanks.

37:26.182 --> 37:30.385
Hey, don't worry about
this whole mother thing.

37:30.453 --> 37:33.220
When the time comes,
you'll be great at it.

37:33.288 --> 37:36.057
And how do you know?

37:36.124 --> 37:40.628
Well, when you hold that baby
for the first time,

37:40.696 --> 37:42.797
and it looks up at you,

37:42.865 --> 37:45.633
it's gonna fall instantly
in love.

37:50.805 --> 37:52.673
See ya later, little guy.

37:52.740 --> 37:53.807
(Exhales)

38:00.247 --> 38:01.748
Ty.

38:01.816 --> 38:02.916
Hey.

38:02.984 --> 38:04.917
I didn't know
you were coming.

38:04.985 --> 38:07.319
Ah, Tim invited me.
I hope that's okay?

38:07.387 --> 38:08.854
Yeah, of course.

38:08.922 --> 38:10.590
We can sit and count
how many times grampa cringes

38:10.657 --> 38:11.624
during the ceremony.

38:11.692 --> 38:13.225
(Chuckles)

38:13.293 --> 38:14.393
Hey, I wanted to say.

38:14.461 --> 38:15.561
What you did for
Bryce today was, um...

38:15.629 --> 38:16.862
Yeah, I know.

38:16.930 --> 38:19.631
It was risky and I probably
shouldn't have.

38:19.699 --> 38:23.134
I was gonna say,
it was pretty awesome.

38:23.202 --> 38:25.136
All right,
let's get a move on.

38:25.204 --> 38:28.573
Don't wanna be late
for Tim Fleming's big night,

38:28.641 --> 38:29.941
now would we?

38:31.077 --> 38:33.712
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Okay, we're all ready to go.</i>

38:33.779 --> 38:35.513
Grampa, are you ready
for your speech?

38:35.581 --> 38:37.547
Oh, I guess so.

38:37.616 --> 38:38.983
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Isn't he handsome?</i>

38:39.050 --> 38:40.651
<i>Amy:</i> <i>You are, you're just adorable.</i>

38:40.719 --> 38:43.854
We can admire him
in the truck. Let's go.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.990
Okay, J.J.,
are you ready to...

38:46.057 --> 38:47.091
Ow.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.158
You okay?

38:48.226 --> 38:49.093
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm fine.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.427
Okay, J.J., are you... Oh!

38:50.495 --> 38:51.961
Amy: - Lou?
Lou: - Yeah?

38:52.029 --> 38:53.195
Hey.

38:53.263 --> 38:54.998
(Pained moan)

38:55.065 --> 38:56.332
Lou, what is going on?
You talk to me now.

38:56.399 --> 38:57.700
I don't know,
gramp... ah!

38:57.768 --> 38:59.401
Grampa, I feel like
I'm going into labour.

38:59.469 --> 39:00.369
Ohh!

39:00.437 --> 39:01.537
Well, that does it then.

39:01.605 --> 39:03.072
We're going to the hospital.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.274
Lou: (Shaky breaths) Okay, okay.

39:05.342 --> 39:07.809
Amy, can you take
care of J.J.?

39:07.877 --> 39:09.444
Yeah.

39:09.512 --> 39:11.479
Make sure he doesn't get his
little cowboy outfit dirty!

39:11.547 --> 39:13.214
(Pained yelps and moans)

39:13.282 --> 39:14.850
Right to the hospital.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.484
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>My God!</i>

39:23.455 --> 39:25.788
Amy, you did not
have to do that.

39:25.857 --> 39:28.892
I'm perfectly capable
of eating in the kitchen.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.661
No, you need your rest.
Doctor's orders.

39:31.729 --> 39:34.397
I feel terrible...
Thank you.

39:34.465 --> 39:36.699
I feel terrible
about this whole thing.

39:36.767 --> 39:38.601
Well, you have nothing
to feel bad about.

39:38.669 --> 39:39.669
I missed dad's banquet.

39:39.737 --> 39:41.837
And dad totally understands.

39:41.905 --> 39:44.240
Oh my God, if stomach cramps
feel like that,

39:44.307 --> 39:49.178
I don't even want to know
what labour pain's like, Amy.

39:49.246 --> 39:51.347
So who made
grandpa's speech?

39:51.414 --> 39:52.547
Stumpy.

39:52.615 --> 39:53.949
- Stumpy?
- Mm-hm.

39:54.617 --> 39:57.252
Yeah, he's a surprisingly
good public speaker too.

39:57.319 --> 39:58.486
What?

39:58.553 --> 40:00.355
And, you know,
he must really admire dad,

40:00.422 --> 40:02.656
'cause I've never seen
a grown man cry so much

40:02.724 --> 40:03.758
in my life.

40:03.825 --> 40:05.093
(Laughs)

40:06.595 --> 40:10.031
And what about J.J.,
how did he make out?

40:10.099 --> 40:11.199
Oh, he cried right along
with Stumpy

40:11.267 --> 40:13.233
for pretty much
the entire night.

40:13.301 --> 40:14.501
Yeah, actually,
he didn't stop

40:14.568 --> 40:16.603
until his dad came
to pick him up.

40:16.670 --> 40:18.272
You know, I love Marnie,
but that,

40:18.339 --> 40:20.941
that kid is a terror.

40:21.009 --> 40:23.610
Either that or I'm just
really bad with kids.

40:23.677 --> 40:25.312
I don't know
about that.

40:25.380 --> 40:28.348
I think he was crying
for his aunty Lou.

40:28.416 --> 40:29.515
Really?

40:30.417 --> 40:31.817
He was missing me?

40:31.885 --> 40:32.952
Yeah.

40:34.288 --> 40:35.421
Really?

40:37.224 --> 40:38.991
(Microwave whirs)

40:39.059 --> 40:41.394
(Microwave beeps,
phone rings)

40:41.461 --> 40:42.494
Ahhh!

40:42.562 --> 40:44.463
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
Ah!

40:44.531 --> 40:45.663
(Phone rings)

40:47.066 --> 40:48.099
Yeah?

40:49.168 --> 40:50.435
Ashley!

40:50.502 --> 40:54.005
Oh my God, it is so good
to hear your voice.

40:55.674 --> 40:58.709
You're coming home?
That's great news!

40:59.645 --> 41:02.079
It's just I love you
so much.

41:03.048 --> 41:04.348
Ashley? Ashley?

41:07.185 --> 41:08.685
(Exhales happily)

41:09.988 --> 41:10.988
(Bandit nickers)

41:11.056 --> 41:12.456
Good boy.

41:12.523 --> 41:14.624
Yeah, I think I'll keep him
around for awhile.

41:14.692 --> 41:16.060
Who knows...
maybe one day Bandit

41:16.127 --> 41:17.760
and I'll be roping
together again,

41:17.828 --> 41:18.894
eh, buddy?

41:19.830 --> 41:22.865
I have a feeling you will.

41:22.933 --> 41:25.001
Come on.
Get outta here.

41:32.876 --> 41:33.908
(Chuckles)

41:35.078 --> 41:36.111
Come on.

41:39.882 --> 41:41.350
Oh yeah.
(Laughs)

41:48.624 --> 41:51.058
(Hooves clomp, Bandit grunts)

41:53.061 --> 41:55.162
Tim: You know you missed a
heck of a party last night.

41:55.230 --> 41:57.865
Jack: Well, you know, false labour.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.900
Yeah, emphasis
on the false, huh?

41:59.968 --> 42:01.435
We didn't know that,
did we?

42:01.503 --> 42:03.104
Not exactly something
her father

42:03.171 --> 42:04.372
should be joking about,
is it?

42:04.439 --> 42:07.173
Listen,
I'm glad that Lou's okay,

42:07.241 --> 42:08.341
believe me.

42:09.310 --> 42:10.710
But you must
be pretty happy

42:10.777 --> 42:13.346
that you didn't have to deliver
that speech last night.

42:13.414 --> 42:15.948
Well, happy's not
a word I'd use, no.

42:16.017 --> 42:17.050
Uh-huh.

42:20.021 --> 42:23.822
I bet you didn't even
write the thing.

42:23.890 --> 42:25.290
Well, you're wrong about that.

42:25.358 --> 42:26.558
Oh yeah, right.

42:26.626 --> 42:27.493
You're right,
I am wrong about that.

42:27.560 --> 42:29.594
'Cause the napkin...

42:30.530 --> 42:31.696
Yeah.

42:31.764 --> 42:32.898
Well, that's not a speech, Jack.

42:32.965 --> 42:35.700
That's something
to blow your nose on.

42:35.768 --> 42:37.768
You wanna hear it?

42:37.836 --> 42:39.504
Then shut up.

42:53.584 --> 42:56.819
(Reading) Tim Fleming is a real S.O.B.

42:58.356 --> 42:59.989
He's pushy, impatient,

43:00.891 --> 43:03.560
and he's got an ego
the size of the Alberta sky.

43:03.627 --> 43:04.694
All right,
I get it, Jack...

43:04.762 --> 43:06.329
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>But...</i>

43:07.498 --> 43:08.565
He's family.

43:11.501 --> 43:15.271
And I guess that's why I've
always been so hard on him.

43:15.338 --> 43:18.107
That's just the way
family works.

43:20.210 --> 43:22.578
It takes a lot of guts
to be a rodeo cowboy,

43:22.645 --> 43:26.681
that's something Tim Fleming
did better than a lot of us.

43:26.748 --> 43:29.850
But that doesn't mean
much to me,

43:29.918 --> 43:32.287
not when you compare it
to the character it takes

43:32.354 --> 43:35.356
for a man to own up
to his mistakes.

43:36.325 --> 43:37.959
<i>But in the end,</i>

43:38.026 --> 43:40.328
when it really mattered,

43:40.396 --> 43:42.062
he came out on top,

43:43.931 --> 43:47.968
even when the odds
were stacked against him.

43:48.035 --> 43:49.702
And to me that's...

43:52.573 --> 43:56.175
That's the true measure
of a rodeo cowboy.

43:57.611 --> 44:00.379
It's the measure
of a Hall-of-famer,

44:01.448 --> 44:04.016
and it's the measure
of a man.

44:08.721 --> 44:09.954
Are you workin' or not?

44:10.022 --> 44:11.423
Cows don't go
where you want 'em to

44:11.491 --> 44:13.625
just 'cause you think it.

44:13.692 --> 44:19.264
"In the end when it really
mattered he came out on top"...

44:19.332 --> 44:20.897
I love that!

44:24.469 --> 44:27.471
You got a copy of that, Jack?
