-[Bobby] Good job, Tanny.
-Thanks.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.360
[laughs] I'm gonna leave you to get
the bikes. I'm not willing to do that.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.490
[Karamo] Where have you two been?

00:32.574 --> 00:34.284
-We went to get bikes.
-Oh!

00:34.367 --> 00:35.201
-[Antoni] Nice.
-Yeah.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.787
-Why?
-So we can ride over to Abby's.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.122
-Our new hero.
-[Tan] Love.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.166
-[Karamo] We're riding our bikes?
-Not the whole way.

00:41.249 --> 00:45.378
So, we have a few little videos
to watch about Abby today

00:45.462 --> 00:47.589
to learn about her and her passions.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.716
I love vignettes.
I love backstory packages.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.676
I love little story things. Oh, my gosh.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.845
-Come press play, Bobby.
-Come on.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.472
Come on, boys.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.514
[Bobby] All right, we ready?

00:56.598 --> 00:57.807
-Yeah.
-Yes, we are.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.650

01:08.151 --> 01:11.196

<i>the droughts, the hurricanes,</i>

01:11.279 --> 01:12.864

01:13.239 --> 01:15.950

<i>the destruction that will follow me.</i>

01:16.034 --> 01:18.828

01:18.912 --> 01:20.121

01:20.205 --> 01:22.248

01:22.332 --> 01:23.583
<i>It starts with you.</i>

01:24.042 --> 01:25.460
-[man] <i>Thank you.</i>
-[woman] <i>Thank you.</i>

01:25.543 --> 01:28.254
I just love how this generation
is stepping up and saying,

01:28.338 --> 01:31.341
"This is not going to happen anymore,
we're gonna take control."

01:31.716 --> 01:33.676
But I want to learn more about her, Bobby.
Tell us.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.594
[Bobby] All right, guys.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.179
"Abby just graduated from high school,

01:36.262 --> 01:38.348
and is living away from home,
working full-time.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.891
This summer, she's taking a gap year

01:39.974 --> 01:42.352
and working as a fellow
for the Sunrise Movement."

01:42.435 --> 01:43.353
Go, go, go!

01:43.436 --> 01:46.314
We are a youth-led movement fighting
to stop climate change

01:46.397 --> 01:48.233
and create millions of good jobs
in the process.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.444
We love passion. We love movements.
We love drive. Yes, yes, yes.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.445
Okay, come here.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.697
I was really torn between wanting
to focus on school

01:54.781 --> 01:58.159
and feeling really drawn to, like,
spending all my extra time on Sunrise

01:58.243 --> 02:02.122
because this is what made me feel
like I was making a meaningful difference.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.624
"She was nominated by Yvonne, her mother."

02:04.707 --> 02:05.667
Okay.

02:05.750 --> 02:10.088
She is so passionate. She cares so much.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.507
We are gonna go rally
in front of their office.

02:12.590 --> 02:16.678
And so many of these kids
have spent their lifetimes

02:16.761 --> 02:21.015
in a period of uncertainty
and fear, really.

02:21.099 --> 02:26.187
And I think it's amazing that they've
created this movement of youth.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.567
Eighteen, I was trying to figure out how
to decorate my dorm room,

02:30.650 --> 02:32.443
I wasn't thinking about how
to save the planet.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.945
-At all.
-[Karamo] So that's, like,

02:34.028 --> 02:35.697
a big thing to take on
at such a young age.

02:35.780 --> 02:36.990
-[Jonathan] And to be that engaged.
-Yeah.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.492
"Abby lives communally
with eight other young people.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.745
<i>The home is a live-work space where</i>
<i>they regularly host other activists."</i>

02:42.829 --> 02:46.082
I'm living in a movement house,
which is a collective house

02:46.166 --> 02:49.002
that fellows working
for Sunrise in Philadelphia live in.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.130
-Thanks for doing the dishes, Abby.
<i>-</i>Yeah, no problem.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.674
"Once a week, Abby has to make
a vegan meal for the house."

02:54.757 --> 02:56.384
I want your opinion on it.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.219
-Pull it out and then we'll look at it.
-[sighs]

02:58.720 --> 03:01.055
-Don't stress. Don't stress.
-[exclaims]

03:01.139 --> 03:03.308
[Yvonne] When Abby is stressed,

03:03.391 --> 03:06.895
she can forget that she needs
to give herself a break,

03:06.978 --> 03:11.733
and I am concerned that she's
not taking enough time for herself.

03:11.816 --> 03:12.775
[Abby] Oh, my God.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.361
[Yvonne]
With all the things that are going on,

03:15.445 --> 03:17.280
she can completely forget to eat.

of the Sunrise Movement leadership.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.872
Something that she's never done before."

03:25.955 --> 03:26.789
[Karamo] Yes.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.375
I am hoping that through this week,

03:29.459 --> 03:32.837
she'll learn how important it is
to care for herself.

03:32.921 --> 03:36.424
She can't take the weight of the world
on her shoulders.

let's help Abby know her worth

03:39.469 --> 03:40.303
and save the Earth.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.889
-Yeah!
-That's cute.

03:42.972 --> 03:43.890
Right, guys. Let's go!

04:21.719 --> 04:23.304
-Hello.
-[Abby] Welcome.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.682
[Bobby] Oh, my God, there's a lot of you.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.725
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.687
How are you? I'm Bobby.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.147
Hi! Nice to meet you.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.608
Hi. How are you?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.402
[Bobby] How's it going, everybody?

04:37.986 --> 04:40.655
-[Tan] How are you? Nice to meet you.
-[laughing]

04:40.738 --> 04:42.240
-[Bobby] How many people live here?
-[Abby] Eight.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.992
[Bobby]
So, who are the rest of these people?

04:44.075 --> 04:45.159
A lot of people work here.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.245
So, we have, like,
20 people who live in Philly,

04:47.537 --> 04:49.497
and the other house
doesn't have Wi-Fi right now.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.207
-Eww!
-So, we're working here.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.126
-We biked some of the way here.
-Nice.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.795
-It's progress, not perfection.
-We're trying.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.506
I would say that biking is good
because it's really fun,

04:58.589 --> 04:59.674
also, though,

05:00.216 --> 05:04.095
a hundred corporations are responsible
for 70% of global emissions,

05:04.178 --> 05:06.264
so if you do drive, it's not a big deal

05:06.347 --> 05:09.642
because you're not really
causing the big problem.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.643
Oh!

05:10.727 --> 05:12.061
Okay, well that's good to know.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.731
It's also gorgeous, like, core work.
You know?

05:15.148 --> 05:17.984
But I wish I would have known that before
I took out my top knot, to be honest.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.736
-I'm just kidding. I'm so kidding.
-[laughing]

05:19.819 --> 05:21.487
-We love your house.
-So, introduce us.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.656
-Yeah.
-Introduce us. Who is everybody?

05:23.740 --> 05:25.658
-What does everyone do?
-[Abby] This is Xavier.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.869
-[Jonathan] Hi, Xavier.
-How old is everyone in here?

05:27.952 --> 05:28.953
-Twenty-one.
-Twenty-one.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.122
Twenty-two. Andrew's 25.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.584
When you walk into a house full
of 22-year-old activists, you feel old.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.545
I'm like, "I could be your father.
I could be your dad."

05:38.004 --> 05:39.797
-[Jonathan] Touch your gorgeous waves?
-Yes.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.216
-Oh, my God!
-[laughing]

05:42.300 --> 05:45.470
The energy of Gen Z is so apparent
in this home.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.888
These are youths who feel like

05:46.971 --> 05:49.807
they've been handed this world
that's on fire,

05:49.891 --> 05:53.061
and they've decided to undertake trying
to save it.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.813
So, how many people eat here
on a daily basis?

05:56.230 --> 05:58.691
-[Abby] Sometimes we have, like, 12 or 15.
-[Bobby] Okay.

05:58.775 --> 05:59.942
It depends who's in town.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.445
So, is this space working for 15?

06:02.862 --> 06:03.821
-No.
-No.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.406
Sometimes, though, we eat outside
on the porch.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.992
Oh, nice.
I love a good front porch dinner moment.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.621
The movement house
is a very important tool for them.

06:11.996 --> 06:15.917
It's a lounge for fellows, for friends,
it's a workspace.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.421
They use it to put together plans
on protests and all kinds of stuff.

06:20.505 --> 06:24.384
But right now, it looks like a house
for wayward kids.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.345
I think now it's time to say goodbye.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.513
Aww.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.640
-I'm gonna miss you.
-Oh!

06:30.723 --> 06:31.808
[Karamo] Bye, everybody.

06:31.891 --> 06:32.850
-Bye.
-Bye.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.769
-Bye.
-Nice to meet you.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.646
I love your scrunchie.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.399
-I know. I like yours, too.
-Aw, thanks.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.984
-Can we chat outside?
-We can. I'll be right back, guys.

06:42.068 --> 06:42.902
-Okay.
-Bye.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.656
-Wow, this is a tall house.
-[laughs] Yeah.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.116
This is my room.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.034
-You share this with one other person?
-Yeah.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.161
-And you have your own bathroom?
-We have a bathroom

06:52.245 --> 06:53.955
that we share with everybody.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.375
There's this thing she says all the time,

06:57.458 --> 06:59.710
that there's only three things
you need to do...

06:59.794 --> 07:03.589
-Yeah.
-...just work, sleep and social time.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.759
Okay. Work, sleep
and find time for yourself.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.303
Yes, but how she always ends it is,

07:09.387 --> 07:11.681
"Because all my friends are in Sunrise,

07:11.764 --> 07:13.599
I only need to work and sleep."

07:13.683 --> 07:16.727
She's deliberately
removing the social time.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.604
-Yeah.
-Got it.

07:18.688 --> 07:22.024
And I think she feels guilty
if she isn't devoting all of her time...

07:22.233 --> 07:23.901
-Yeah.
-...to the movement, which--

07:23.985 --> 07:26.320
I just don't wanna see her burn out.
I'm nervous for her.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.574
[Bobby] I see that this is
very much a communal home.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.535
-Yeah.
-And the bedrooms are more--

07:32.618 --> 07:34.287
Not necessarily transient, but they are.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.122
-They are very transient.
-They're kind of a stopover.

07:36.205 --> 07:41.210
It's less like my room and more like
the place where I am right now.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.588
Yeah, so my thought was

07:43.671 --> 07:46.007
I put all my time
and effort in downstairs.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.592
-Yeah. That sounds great.
-Yeah? Okay.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.053
Making a space for Abby this week
that's just for her

07:51.137 --> 07:52.180
doesn't really make sense.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.932
She's only in the house
until her fellowship ends.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.393
So, I really wanna focus

07:57.477 --> 07:59.645
on making the first floor really work

07:59.729 --> 08:02.190
for present occupants and future.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.318
[Antoni] Rusty.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.279
These cabinets are very 1990.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.823
I hope she's not using that hand soap
on her face.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.867
[Tan laughs] Definitely not-- not great.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.369
-[Antoni] I guess that's not functional.
-[Bobby] Not at all.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.371
[Jonathan] Come on, just try it on.
It's beyond cute.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.289
[Tan] All right.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.249
Considering she doesn't
really get dressed up,

08:20.333 --> 08:21.751
she's got a lot of print in here.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.793
I'm not a size four.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.796
[Antoni] Okay, so this is your kitchen.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.215
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

08:27.965 --> 08:31.302
-You look nervous in your own kitchen.
-[laughs] Um...

08:31.385 --> 08:34.138
I didn't ever cook at home.
My dad is a retired chef.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.682
That's nice. So there was always
a nice home-cooked meal.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.851
Yes, I was super super lucky.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.312
-What does your mom do?
-My mom is a professor.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.023
She's, like, a researcher
in the school of public health.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.316
-Oh!
-Yeah.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.109
-She's super cool.
-She's awesome.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.861
-She's so cool.
-Okay. Do you have siblings?

08:48.945 --> 08:51.113
-Yeah, I have a little brother. He's 16.
-Aww.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.074
We're really good friends.
It's really nice.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.909
because you get
to have that sense of community

08:54.992 --> 08:56.827
It's so fitting that you ended up here

08:56.911 --> 08:58.704
because you get
to have that sense of community

08:58.788 --> 09:01.249
and, like, people supporting
and taking care of each other.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.166
Yeah.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.669
You guys take turns,
you prepare meals for everybody?

09:04.752 --> 09:05.586
Yeah.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.213
You're holding your hands together
like you're already nervous.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.506
[exclaims]

09:08.589 --> 09:12.301
[laughs] I was just thinking about
having to prepare a meal for everybody.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.053
It gives you anxiety a little?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.806
It's just really hard 'cause you're
the only person making dinner.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.016
-Yeah.
-And if you make it and it sucks...

09:19.100 --> 09:21.060
-Well, you don't wanna disappoint.
-Yeah.

09:21.727 --> 09:25.731
-Abby has this very nervous disposition.
-[laughs]

09:25.856 --> 09:28.484
[Antoni] Cooking should be something
that's pleasurable and enjoyable.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.820
It's a little moment in time
where you can just sit there

09:30.903 --> 09:31.988
and focus on one thing.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.781
She sees it as a stressor.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.992
That's the last thing she needs
in her life right now,

09:36.075 --> 09:37.410
is another thing to stress about.

09:37.493 --> 09:38.536
Are you an anxious person?

09:39.328 --> 09:40.204
Yeah.

09:40.288 --> 09:44.375
I would--
I've been told that I seem anxious.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.711
-Hmm.
-I think that probably is because I--

09:46.794 --> 09:48.963
Yeah, I am. I'm pretty anxious.

09:50.006 --> 09:50.840
Gotcha.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.342
I don't want to make it negative,
but like, she's stressed as f--

09:55.636 --> 09:58.472
I love a good found or used moment,

09:58.556 --> 10:00.057
but these are just dirty.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.852
[Jonathan]
So tell me. You're gorgeous, Abby, and...

10:03.728 --> 10:06.439
You literally gave me
an asymmetrical eyebrow when I said that.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.691
-[laughs]
-You are!

10:08.774 --> 10:12.069
But I just wanna hear a little about you
and like, what happens for you here.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.946
Yeah, well...

10:14.030 --> 10:17.074
I have my toothbrush.

10:17.158 --> 10:17.992
Yes.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.453
I have my toothpaste.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.370
Yes.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.997
I brush my teeth here.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.624
-Yes.
-Um...

10:25.958 --> 10:29.587
[clicks teeth]
That is about it for this space.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.341
Can we just take your hair down
and look at your cut for a second?

10:33.424 --> 10:36.010
'Cause I know you don't wanna spend
a ton of time doing your hair.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.430
You have great, kind of a little bit
of a wavy texture to it.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.891
I kind of wish that you had
a little edge to the hair,

10:41.974 --> 10:44.810
where it was like, "If you come
for the environment, I'll come for you."

10:45.186 --> 10:47.229
-Whoo!
-Oh, I love that!

10:48.022 --> 10:49.398
-[Tan] Hello, love.
-[Abby] Hi.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.983
-[Tan] I have questions.
-[Abby] Okay.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.569
I saw you speak.
Is that what you're doing daily?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.905
You're going out there
and you're speaking or no?

10:55.988 --> 10:58.157
No, I have meetings with people

10:58.240 --> 11:00.076
who are doing, like, local work in Philly.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.370
-Okay, great.
-Like, a partner that we're working with

11:02.453 --> 11:03.704
or other organizers.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.165
When you're in meetings,
do you feel like, "Yeah, I fit in,"

11:06.248 --> 11:07.375
like, "I belong here?"

11:07.458 --> 11:08.626
[laughs] Not usually.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.543
Okay.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.213
I think sometimes people don't notice
that I'm much younger,

11:12.296 --> 11:14.340
but sometimes they do,
and I always notice a lot.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.926
-Yeah.
-I always walk in and I'm like, "Oh..."

11:17.426 --> 11:19.929
I will say your clothing looks young.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.931
I like these clothes. They're comfortable.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.101
But I think that finding clothes
where I feel more of a badass.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.479
-Yeah. I found these next to your bed.
-Oh.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.523
When were these taken?

11:30.606 --> 11:33.067
Yeah. This was prom.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.111
-[Tan] Okay.
-And this was homecoming.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.779
-[Tan] I love the dress.
-Yeah.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.323
Tell me, when was the last time
you felt pretty?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.033
It was prom,

11:41.117 --> 11:44.745
-and then before that, homecoming.
-[laughs] Okay, good.

11:44.829 --> 11:48.499
I don't know.
I think I usually don't think about

11:48.582 --> 11:50.626
-if I feel pretty or not.
-Okay.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.338
Do you feel like you won't
be taken seriously if you're feminine?

11:54.422 --> 11:56.382
I think it's-- yeah, maybe a little bit.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.425
-Yeah.
-And, like,

11:57.508 --> 11:59.260
people don't really take women
that seriously,

11:59.343 --> 12:02.596
and it's hard to be a young woman
who's, like, very obviously a young woman.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.098
I love that you're a strong woman,

12:04.181 --> 12:06.726
and I wanna put you in things
that would be perfectly appropriate

12:06.809 --> 12:10.062
for you in any room
so that we really can empower you

12:10.146 --> 12:11.564
to do even more great work.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.481
Yeah.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.775
-You are a fan of AOC. I hear that.
-Yeah.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.569
She looks bomb.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.612
-[laughs] She does. I know.
-Dope. Bomb.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.197
She's not dressing sexually.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.074
-Right.
-She wants to feel powerful.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.036
-Be honest. Do you want that?
-I would prefer that. [laughs]

12:26.120 --> 12:29.039
You are a leader,
why wouldn't you dress like a leader?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.125
Yeah.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.252
You always know it's a teen,
early-20-something

12:33.335 --> 12:35.546
when you have
the obligatory hanging Christmas lights.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.631
[Bobby] Or the set of <i>Stranger Things.</i>

12:37.715 --> 12:40.801
<i>♪ Let's go upstairs ♪ </i>Whoo!

12:40.885 --> 12:42.803
Your roommate shared with me
your sort of motto.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.430
-Oh.
-[laughs]

12:44.513 --> 12:45.973
Well, it is true if--

12:46.640 --> 12:49.226
So you need, like, sleep time, work time
and social time,

12:49.310 --> 12:53.230
but if you are friends with
and love spending time with all

12:53.355 --> 12:55.441
of the people that you are working with,

12:55.524 --> 12:57.109
work time is like social time.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.027
Got it.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.779
[laughs] So, you only need work time
and sleep time.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.696
Yeah.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.325
Because we don't have, like,
a structured, like, workday,

13:04.408 --> 13:05.951
it's hard to, like, turn it off.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.913
It's a lot of responsibility.
Like, we all have, like, a lot of work

13:08.996 --> 13:10.539
that we're responsible for getting done.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.126
But sometimes, I think especially I'm,
like, really prone to feeling overwhelmed.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.044
-And, like,
-Yeah.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.962
every time you mess something up,
you're like,

13:17.046 --> 13:21.008
"Whoa, did I just, like, stop our chances
of, like, stopping climate change?"

13:21.091 --> 13:22.134
Yeah.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.261
Abby is feeling a lot of pressure.

13:24.345 --> 13:28.974
Feeling as if she has to take on
this entire movement by herself.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.352
And that's maybe not even that
so much as like,

13:31.435 --> 13:32.561
"If I do this right,

13:32.645 --> 13:34.730
we're so much clo-- like, we get closer."

13:35.105 --> 13:37.608
But I get it.
I'm getting anxiety just being here.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.194
-Thanks for sharing.
-Yeah. Oh, thank you.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.823
[Jonathan] I feel very much proud of you,
and we haven't even done anything yet.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.866
-[Abby] I am excited. I'm like...
-Good.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.786
a little-- I don't know,
I have no idea what's gonna happen.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.247
-We want you to have fun. You're 18.
-[Antoni] Yes.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.374
Like, I really want you
to have a fun week.

13:53.457 --> 13:56.460
We'll learn stuff, but let's have fun.
Let's make that our core.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.878
-Love that.
-[Jonathan] Yeah.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.005
We should bring it in. Sunrise.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.757
[all] Three, two, one.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.092
Sunrise!

14:03.175 --> 14:07.471
<i>♪ Yeah, it's all good</i>
<i>And getting even better ♪</i>

14:09.682 --> 14:12.935
The fact that Abby's motto is
"Work, sleep, socialize,

14:13.018 --> 14:15.938
but I don't have to socialize
because all my friends are at work,"

14:16.021 --> 14:16.856
is a problem.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.525
There has to be work-life balance,

14:19.608 --> 14:21.735
and I want her to realize
that she's young,

14:21.819 --> 14:23.904
and she needs to find moments
for having fun.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.073
<i>♪ Make it last forever ♪</i>

14:26.615 --> 14:29.326
Often, in order for people
to really take you serious,

14:29.410 --> 14:32.162
you need to look
like you've got yourself put together,

14:32.246 --> 14:35.624
so I want to make this place look
like the organized movement

14:35.708 --> 14:37.877
that the Sunrise Movement actually is.

14:39.003 --> 14:42.256
[Antoni] Making food for other people
in Abby's life right now is a given.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.757
It's something she has to do.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.801
So why not turn it into something
that's enjoyable?

14:46.427 --> 14:49.013
I want to show her
how she can do that for herself.

14:51.390 --> 14:55.728
There is nowhere that it is written
that an activist must not be feminine.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.856
I want Abby to see her femininity
as her power,

14:58.939 --> 15:00.399
definitely not her hindrance.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.527
[Jonathan] Abby is 18 years old,
and I want her to realize

15:03.611 --> 15:06.030
that she does not have to come
at her personal appearance

15:06.113 --> 15:08.407
from a place of fear
and of other peoples' judgment.

[Abby] I love your shoes. So cute.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.385
[Bobby] Thank you.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.013
[Abby] Whoa!

15:32.598 --> 15:34.224
Hey, Mike, how's it going?

15:37.311 --> 15:38.979
I know you guys use the house to live,

15:39.063 --> 15:40.981
-use the house to work.
-Yeah.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.901
Do you also want to eventually
use the home to, like,

15:44.443 --> 15:47.196
have, like, meetings and have press over?

15:47.446 --> 15:48.697
Yeah. As a movement,

15:48.781 --> 15:51.283
we are, like, so organized
and so structured,

15:51.367 --> 15:53.744
but, like, if you walk
into our house right now,

15:53.827 --> 15:55.412
-you really can't see that.
-Right.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.414
It needs to look
like a serious organization.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.791
-Right.
-And right now...

15:58.874 --> 16:01.460
-[laughs] Yeah. Very messy.
-...it looks not even like a frat house.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.546
The thing that I love about this
is because of its size,

16:04.630 --> 16:06.048
I can fit two of them.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.050
-Oh, okay.
-What I also like about this...

16:08.133 --> 16:09.343
-Yeah.
-...is it's a daybed,

16:09.426 --> 16:12.513
so if you have more movement members
that need to crash for the night...

16:12.596 --> 16:13.722
Yeah, that's fantastic.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.184
-[Bobby] What do you think of this?
-This is beautiful.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.936
I kind of like that it's marble, too.

16:19.019 --> 16:19.979
It's like, very earthy.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.731
-It's kind of funky, late 80s.
-Yeah.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.358
I think it'll look very cool

16:24.441 --> 16:28.112
with the mixed-use, mixed-look
that I'm going for in your house.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.279
-in your house.
-Yeah.

16:30.447 --> 16:33.867
What was it that made you want to do this?

16:33.951 --> 16:36.245
It was really hard for me to be like--

16:36.328 --> 16:38.789
to, like, see what was going on
in my community

16:38.872 --> 16:40.958
and, like, know what was going on
in the world.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.626
You know, like, 70 years from now,

16:42.710 --> 16:44.670
summers are supposed to be
ten degrees hotter.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.880
Seventy years from now,
all the people who, like,

16:46.964 --> 16:49.633
made it so the summers
are gonna be that hotter will be dead,

16:49.717 --> 16:52.511
and I'm going to be, like,
an old person living with that.

16:52.594 --> 16:53.762
-Yeah.
-And to also know

16:53.846 --> 16:55.848
that I could be making a real difference

16:55.931 --> 16:57.725
with this, like, terrible thing.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.269
You know, it's very commendable.
Not many people can do that,

17:00.352 --> 17:03.731
which is why I wanted to find places
that we could recycle, reduce, reuse.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.274
-Definitely. Yeah.
-You know?

17:05.357 --> 17:07.526
This one is long enough
to go along the whole wall...

17:07.609 --> 17:08.694
-Yeah.
-...against the window.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.821
And then this one we can cut in half,

17:10.904 --> 17:13.198
-and it can go along the side.
-Okay. Wow. Yeah.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.868
-And that way, you can fit tons of people.
-Oh, my gosh.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.369
And I asked

17:17.995 --> 17:20.998
-your friends to come help us resand this.
-That's wonderful.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.583

17:23.667 --> 17:26.962
You don't have to consume new things

17:27.337 --> 17:28.672
You can start here with me.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.383
By using used and repurposed stuff,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.844
you can still stand by your ideals.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.638
You can make a positive impact
on the environment,

17:56.241 --> 17:58.285
[Antoni] I'm taking Abby to our next spot.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.871
-Have you ever ridden one of these before?
-No.

18:00.954 --> 18:01.789
Same.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.457
-[Abby] All right, ready? Let's go.
-I got you.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.584
-[squeals, laughs]
-I got you.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.840
-This is a good area.
-Yeah, it's super cute.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.636
[Antoni] Yes, the world needs Abby
and activists like her

18:15.719 --> 18:16.845
to do what they do.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.432
-It's overwhelming. It's like <i>E.T.</i>
-[laughs]

18:20.516 --> 18:22.184
[Antoni]
But I don't want her to burn out, either.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.685
I want Abby to have fun.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.396
Abby needs to remember that she's also 18.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.024
-Look at us, we're learning new things.
-Whoo!

18:29.108 --> 18:31.235
[Antoni] She's gotta have a good giggle
every once in a while.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.863
-[laughs] Whew!
-Okay, we made it.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.534
-Let's go.
-[laughs]

18:38.617 --> 18:41.328
-Hi.
-Hello, my dear, how are you?

18:41.411 --> 18:43.205
-I'm good, how are you?
-[Tan] Hi.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.666
Okay, you guys, this is Eili and Kylie.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.042
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.962
This is Eili's store.
It's beautifully curated. I'm obsessed.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.714
I've already been pulling some stuff,
so what I'm gonna do is this:

18:52.798 --> 18:54.633
Abby, you're gonna be with me
for a few minutes.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.386
Ant, I've pulled
some gorgeous looks for you.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.097
I've set it all up, but will you guys
show him where it is?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.224
-Great. Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.225
[Antoni] Awesome.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.310
-Cool. Hi.
-Hi, my love.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.436
What are you thinking?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.981
Who's that girl that you have in mind
when you're shopping?

19:09.106 --> 19:12.025
Oh, I'm sort of thinking,
"Well, this is, like, really cute,

19:12.109 --> 19:14.528
but like, will I feel, like,
comfortable in it?"

19:14.611 --> 19:15.988
-Okay.
-Yeah.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.323
If you were
to get slightly more dressed up,

19:18.407 --> 19:21.326
do you think that people
within your community would

19:22.035 --> 19:25.205
have any negative thoughts
about you getting a bit more dressed up?

19:27.166 --> 19:30.043
I think that I would worry about that.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.379
I can imagine. If you get to the point

19:32.462 --> 19:35.883
where you're trying things on
that actually feel like the real you...

19:35.966 --> 19:37.467
-Yeah.
-...instead of hiding away,

19:37.551 --> 19:39.803
you might find
that people really embrace it.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.972
My biggest concern, Abby,

19:42.055 --> 19:46.226
is that you kind of want
to feel invisible in your clothes.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.146
-Yeah.
-But you're trying to lead a movement,

19:49.229 --> 19:51.815
and so, you wanna do yourself every favor

19:51.899 --> 19:55.611
by feeling the best you possibly can
about who you are, what you are.

19:55.694 --> 19:59.031
That I dress appropriately,
that I feel respectable and respected.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.868
We are living
in a wonderful time in the US

20:02.951 --> 20:04.828
where women are taking power

20:04.912 --> 20:07.414
and they are not chucking
their femininity out the door.

20:07.497 --> 20:10.167
If you don't have strong sense of self,

20:10.250 --> 20:11.710
you're not prepared for this.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.921
I don't want Abby to hide away.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.924
I want her to be able
to dress the way she wants dress

20:17.007 --> 20:18.884
and use that in her arsenal.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.260
Okay.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.804
-Yacht.
-[Tan] Yeah.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.431
Mykonos.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.391
-That's the one.
-Love you guys.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.684
-Leaving you guys.
-You out?

20:27.768 --> 20:28.602
All right.

20:28.685 --> 20:29.645
Hey, be careful.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.564
There's gonna be a lot of car accidents
when you step out in that.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.857
-[Antoni] Goodbye.
-[laughs]

20:33.941 --> 20:35.108
Right, you ready to try on?

20:35.192 --> 20:36.151
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.195
Abby, you ready?

20:38.612 --> 20:39.446
[Abby] Yep.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.364
Let's see.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.115
Gorge.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.409
-Gorge. Okay.
-[laughs]

20:44.493 --> 20:45.994
This is something for work.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.163
This is something you could wear
outside of work,

20:48.247 --> 20:51.041
just to make yourself feel the pretty
that you were feeling

20:51.124 --> 20:52.334
in the pictures that I saw.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.752
I like the pattern a lot,

20:53.835 --> 20:56.546
and the fabric is really fun.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.550
I could see myself wearing it
if I was, like, going out with my friends.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.761
-Like a picnic or something.
-Good.

21:02.844 --> 21:06.014
Yeah, it feels pretty. I feel like,
"Yeah, I'm gonna wear this dress,

21:06.390 --> 21:08.183
-what are you gonna do about it?"
-[laughs]

21:08.267 --> 21:11.144
All right. Now you can get
into your second look. Thank you.

21:14.856 --> 21:15.691
Hey.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.943
Oh, it's so good.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.279
Yeah. I really like it.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.447
I love it.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.700
-[Abby laughs]
-Okay, wait. Finishing touches.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.286
-Let's take your earrings out.
-Okay.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.912
[Tan] Let me give you something else.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.580
I do really love earrings.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.332
-You do? That makes me happy.
-Yeah.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.292
I wear them most days.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.876
-Oh, good.
-It's a really easy way to...

21:34.960 --> 21:38.088
A really easy way to show your personality
without going super bold.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.007
-Yeah.
-Tell me what you see.

21:40.757 --> 21:41.925
Um...

21:42.467 --> 21:45.012
-I look like I know what I'm doing.
-Yeah, you do.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.180
Do you ever put your hair up?
Can I just see you with it up?

21:47.264 --> 21:48.098
Yeah.

21:49.182 --> 21:52.477
If I saw someone dressed like this
at a meeting,

21:52.561 --> 21:55.605
I would be intimidated [laughs]

21:55.731 --> 21:58.734
Or I would say,
"Wow, she looks really confident."

21:58.817 --> 22:01.445
-I should listen to that person.
-Yeah. [laughs]

22:01.528 --> 22:04.990
You can be fighting for the planet
and dress sustainably,

22:05.073 --> 22:10.454
without having to sacrifice being stylish,
fashionable and professional.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.748
So, next time when you look in the mirror,
and you think,

22:12.831 --> 22:15.208
"Am I looking too feminine?
Am I looking too pretty?"

22:15.292 --> 22:18.879
There's no such thing.
If it makes you feel good, go for it.

22:18.962 --> 22:21.006
You're a strong woman. Show them.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.299
Yeah.

22:26.928 --> 22:28.347
-[Karamo] Wanna skip?
-[Abby] Yeah.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.349
[laughing]

22:30.766 --> 22:33.477
[Karamo] Why not skip in city hall, right?
It's the best thing.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.394
[Abby] Yeah.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.105
[Karamo] This is a normal spot for you
because you're always out here...

22:37.189 --> 22:39.358
-Yeah.
-...making things happen.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.984
After our conversation,

22:41.068 --> 22:43.820
I realized,
with the career you're choosing,

22:43.904 --> 22:45.238
you're taking on a lot.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.949
Abby is 18 going on 47.

22:48.408 --> 22:49.493
Everything is about her job.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.953
Her life, where she lives, her joy.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.497
If somebody had said to me,

22:53.580 --> 22:56.291
"Do you see yourself
tandem bike-riding with Antoni?"

22:56.375 --> 22:58.668
I would've said
that you might've been on drugs,

22:58.752 --> 23:00.504
-but that sounds fun.
-Yeah.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.506
-It was fun though, right?
-Yeah.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.884
It just showed you, like, you don't know
where life is gonna take you next.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.219
-No.
-And that's okay.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.178
Yeah.

23:08.261 --> 23:11.014
What I want her to do is figure out how
to deal with feeling stressed,

23:11.098 --> 23:13.392
feeling anxious
and how to find time for herself.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.894
I invited somebody here to talk
with us a little bit.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.355
-[Abby] Oh, okay.
-[laughing]

23:18.438 --> 23:20.649
[Karamo] We're gonna skip everywhere.

23:21.525 --> 23:22.776
This is who I invited.

23:23.610 --> 23:24.611
Hi.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.948
-Hello.
-Hi.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.074
[Helen laughs] Good to see you.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.992
-So you obviously know who this is.
-Yes.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.995
-She is like-- oh, my God. Such a badass.
-[laughs]

23:34.079 --> 23:36.790
On the streets, like,
fighting for her community,

23:36.873 --> 23:38.959
and then she became a city councilperson.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.128
This is someone who's been
where you're at.

23:41.211 --> 23:44.131
[Helen] Part of being around activism
and organizing

23:44.214 --> 23:47.134
is that it's a journey
rather than a destination.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.927
And that's life itself, you know.

23:49.010 --> 23:52.514
But ultimately, there is a lot
about politics and about movements

23:52.597 --> 23:55.892
that can take people in
because it's so consuming

23:55.976 --> 23:59.229
because it's hard to not feel
like you're trying to save the world

23:59.312 --> 24:00.772
-each and every single day.
-Amen.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.775
Movements need energy,
and they need new ideas

24:03.859 --> 24:05.026
to kind of evolve and grow.

24:05.402 --> 24:08.989
And so your ability to free other people--

24:09.072 --> 24:10.532
It's like a Toni Morrison thing,

24:10.615 --> 24:13.702
but your ability to free other people
relies on you yourself also being free.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.455
You live and work in the same space.

24:16.538 --> 24:17.664
[laughs]

24:17.747 --> 24:19.749
-And that is difficult for anyone.
-Yeah. Yeah.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.168
That's why people go home.

24:21.501 --> 24:22.794
-But for you, you're there.
-[Abby] Yeah.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.630
And I don't wanna take away from that,
but while you're there,

24:25.714 --> 24:29.092
you have to know how to remove yourself
so you can find joy.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.637
Yes, I'm a young activist,
and I'm going out there

24:32.721 --> 24:36.016
and stopping predatory gambling
or saying no to a baseball stadium,

24:36.099 --> 24:37.184
in downtown Chinatown,

24:37.267 --> 24:39.102
but also, I'm raising my own kids

24:39.186 --> 24:41.188
-and doing things I love...
-[Abby] Yeah.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.523
...like martial arts,
or, you know, running.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.735
At the end of the day,
it can't be all about the movement.

24:46.818 --> 24:47.694
Yeah.

24:47.777 --> 24:51.239
I want Abby to realize that
if she wants a career in helping people

24:51.323 --> 24:54.367
and creating change,
she has to take care of herself.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.453
There has to be balance in your life.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.289
Did you think you'd be skipping
around city hall with me?

24:59.372 --> 25:01.833
-No.
-[laughing]

25:01.917 --> 25:03.251
-Was it fun, though?
-Yeah.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.628
Good, good.

25:04.711 --> 25:08.298
You're doing amazing work,
and there has to be joy and hope in that,

25:08.381 --> 25:10.091
-but it also is stressful.
-Yeah.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.968
-When you start to feel the anxiety...
-Yeah.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.221
...what do you start to feel?
What does your mind start to tell you?

25:15.138 --> 25:16.640
I think I just get overwhelmed.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.142
It's like there's too many things
and not enough time,

25:19.226 --> 25:22.896
or, like, I'm not good enough
at what I'm doing,

25:22.979 --> 25:25.732
or, like
I'm not gonna get everything done.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.734
Or I'm not gonna do it well enough.

25:27.817 --> 25:29.861
You are enough, and you have enough time.

25:29.945 --> 25:30.779
Yeah.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.573
I feel like I do know this,
I just can't, like...

25:33.657 --> 25:35.283
When it comes to self care,

25:35.367 --> 25:36.618
we have to find joy

25:36.701 --> 25:38.161
-outside of our jobs.
-Yeah.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.663
I know. Oh.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.414
-So let's go do something else fun.
-Yeah.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.668
-Are we gonna skip now?
-Yeah, we'll skip.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.045
[laughing]

26:01.518 --> 26:02.978
This-- Ooh. Planter?

26:03.061 --> 26:04.145
They're for outside.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.855
They can grow their own herbs.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.275
The cabinet color came out really great.

26:08.608 --> 26:09.859
All right. It's coming along.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.361
[both] Bye.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.414
-[gobbles]
-[snorts]

26:23.290 --> 26:25.125
[rooster crows]

26:25.250 --> 26:26.459
[Abby] This is brand-new to me.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.670
-So, you've never been to Greensgrow?
-No.

26:28.795 --> 26:31.214
-But your best friend works here.
-My best friend works here.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.132
-[laughs]
-I love that.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.719
-They have, like, awesome tomatoes here.
-Oh.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.556
-Oh, my gosh.
-We have our own little station here.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.141
-Isn't this cute?
-Wow!

26:41.808 --> 26:45.312
Nobody needs anxiety in their life.
Abby certainly does not need more of it.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.106
I want to change the experience
of preparing food

26:48.189 --> 26:50.025
and turn it into something
that's enjoyable.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.402
I was really inspired
when I got here to Philly.

26:52.485 --> 26:55.238
Chef Mike Solomonov makes this wonderful--

26:55.322 --> 26:57.198
It's a twice-cooked eggplant.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.200
-Yum. Okay.
-It's 100% vegan,

26:59.284 --> 27:00.535
-cheap and cheerful.
-Yeah.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.538
We wanna feed a crew, great leftovers.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.416
-Yeah.
-We're gonna make a simplified version.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.334
Awesome.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.170
Abby has to feed a big crowd
at the end of the week.

27:10.253 --> 27:13.882
So, we have our rice with our lentils.
There's strands of onion in there.

27:14.341 --> 27:17.802
I wanna show her how to use ingredients
that she's already familiar with.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.221
But turn them into something special
and a little bit different.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.558
So, the thing with eggplant--
This is a really good trick.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.435
You basically salt it generously...

27:25.518 --> 27:27.479
-Mm-hmm. Okay.
-...on either side.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.272
And what the salt is gonna do

27:29.356 --> 27:32.442
is force the eggplant
to get rid of a lot of its moisture,

27:32.525 --> 27:35.737
and that's gonna help with removing
that whole sliminess component, you know.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.615
You're gonna see these nice little beads
of moisture that form over it.

27:38.698 --> 27:41.326
-Okay.
-Then all you do is just brush them off.

27:41.409 --> 27:42.994
And then you have
these beautiful pieces...

27:43.370 --> 27:44.829
-Wonderful.
-...that are all ready to go.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.582
Next up, put the eggplant in the oil.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.917
Just put a single layer.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.877
-We don't want to crowd it too much.
-Yeah.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.045
-Look how beautiful.
-Yeah.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.506
Like, don't worry about it
getting that dark.

27:54.589 --> 27:55.423
[Abby] Okay.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.884
[Antoni] We want it to get nice
and crispy like that.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.970
A lot of us are intimidated
about going into a kitchen

28:01.054 --> 28:02.347
'cause we don't know what we're doing.

28:02.430 --> 28:04.683
Cut these up into little cubes, basically.

28:04.766 --> 28:05.600
Okay.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.812
But it starts somewhere.
It starts with one single recipe.

28:08.895 --> 28:09.938
Sometimes with one ingredient.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.316
-No stress.
-[laughing]

28:13.900 --> 28:15.985
Okay, let's see how we did.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.657
Mmm! It's so good.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.075
The eggplant is amazing.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.702
-Isn't the eggplant nice?
-Mm-hmm.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.662
-You think you can make this?
-I think so.

28:25.745 --> 28:26.788
-Yeah. [laughs]
-Yeah?

28:26.871 --> 28:29.666
Maybe I'll have to enlist one
of my housemates to help me, but...

28:29.749 --> 28:31.251
If that makes you more comfortable,

28:31.334 --> 28:32.877
maybe it's something nice
that you can enjoy

28:32.961 --> 28:34.546
with a housemate while you're making it,

28:34.629 --> 28:36.589
-and just interacting with somebody,
-Yeah.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.092
and not check out,
but I guess check in, you know?

28:39.509 --> 28:41.010
I think they're gonna
be pretty damn impressed.

28:41.094 --> 28:41.928
[laughs]

28:42.011 --> 28:44.264
[upbeat music playing]

28:47.434 --> 28:48.685
[Jonathan] This is Moko.

28:48.768 --> 28:52.188
This is such a cute salon
that I'm really excited to show you.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.691
-After you.
-[loud beeping]

28:54.774 --> 28:57.360
I love a subtle trash can beep.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.903
-It's gorgeous!
-[Abby laughs]

28:58.987 --> 29:01.364
-Monique. Thanks for having us.
-Thank you. Welcome to Moko.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.490
-You bet.
-[Jonathan] Namaste.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.200
-We love you.
-Namaste to you, too.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.869
[Jonathan] She carries lines.

29:05.952 --> 29:09.080
They're all organic
and sustainably sourced,

29:09.164 --> 29:10.832
which is fierce.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.878
I want to introduce Abby to some
of my personal care friends

29:14.961 --> 29:17.505
that are very non-toxic and, like,
great for the environment

29:17.589 --> 29:19.007
and, like, reduce plastic and waste.

29:19.799 --> 29:20.842
I love you in a bob,

29:20.925 --> 29:24.637
you know, chin to collar bone continues
to be the gift that keeps on giving,

29:24.721 --> 29:27.724
but I do feel like the bottom of it,
it's just, like, a little tiny bit bulky

29:27.807 --> 29:29.726
-It's a little teensy-weensy bit heavy.
-Oh, yeah.

29:29.809 --> 29:32.312
Just take a bit of the weight out
so that these little baby waves

29:32.395 --> 29:33.521
-can live their best life.
-Cool.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.274
I wanna cut it so that it can air-dry
and just look amazing.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.317
-That sounds great.
-Yeah.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.496
I love this.

29:49.579 --> 29:51.247
-It's gonna be even cuter when I'm done.
-Oh!

29:52.040 --> 29:53.708
I'm so excited for you to vote.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.877
-It's your first election, right?
-[shouts] Yeah.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.671
We have a huge voter registration campaign
in the fall,

29:58.755 --> 29:59.798
and I'm so pumped about it.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.967
[Jonathan]
I know that Abby is 18 years old

30:03.051 --> 30:06.221
and is more aware on the issues
that our world is facing

30:06.304 --> 30:08.181
than a lot of people will ever be
in their whole life.

30:08.264 --> 30:10.391
[Abby] Wait, so who is Liza Minnelli?

30:10.475 --> 30:12.352
[Jonathan] Liza Minnelli? Wow.

30:12.435 --> 30:13.728
[laughs] I'm sorry.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.355
Um, wow.

30:15.438 --> 30:18.441
Although, we also need to know
about, like, Liza Minnelli.

30:18.525 --> 30:19.943
We also need to know about Judy Garland.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.111
We need to know about,
like, Barbra Streisand, honey.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.363
<i>Funny Girl. </i>She's hilar.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.656
[laughs] Have you ever seen <i>Sister Act?</i>

30:24.739 --> 30:25.740
No, what's that?

30:25.824 --> 30:29.244
-Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.
-[laughs] I'm sorry!

30:29.327 --> 30:32.038
Seriously, you have to know
about <i>Sister Act 1 </i>and <i>2.</i>

30:32.121 --> 30:35.667
And they hide her in a convent of nuns,

30:35.750 --> 30:38.545
and they've got a choir,
but the choir can't sing,

30:38.628 --> 30:41.673
but you see, she's been a performer
in Vegas for decades, honey,

30:41.756 --> 30:43.341
and she's got something to share,

30:43.424 --> 30:44.843
and that's the gift of song,

30:44.926 --> 30:46.386
so she becomes the conductor

30:46.469 --> 30:48.680
and turns them into this sick choir.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.432
And then, in <i>Sister Act 2,</i>
she helps, like, Lauryn Hill,

30:51.516 --> 30:52.934
Jennifer Love Hewitt

30:53.017 --> 30:54.269
and all these other people

30:54.352 --> 30:57.438
-win the all-state singing competition.
-[laughing]

30:57.522 --> 31:01.568
Thus saving their parochial
Catholic school from imminent closure.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.778
[laughing]

31:03.862 --> 31:05.446
I don't know how I missed that.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.031
-Me either, girl.
-<i>Sister Act?</i>

31:07.115 --> 31:09.617
You were too busy learning--
or, like, saving the world.

31:11.828 --> 31:14.831
Your haircut looks amazing. Perfect.

31:14.914 --> 31:18.251
I wanted to give Abby
a high-velocity glam look.

31:18.334 --> 31:20.003
This is Sanaj. We love Sanaj.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.546
Hi, nice to meet you.

31:21.629 --> 31:24.340
[Jonathan] I wanted to give her
contour, layers, levels.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.717
I wanted to show her everything.

31:25.800 --> 31:30.305
I want her to realize that she is allowed
to express herself however she wants to.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.723
I love her either way.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.516
I just wanna show her
that she has options,

31:33.600 --> 31:36.436
and I feel that after this week,
she knows that she does.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.273
-All right, my gorgeous darling.
-[laughs]

31:40.356 --> 31:42.692
This is just, like, really a look
that says, like,

31:42.775 --> 31:45.737
"Get out of my way, climate change,
I'm saving the world."

31:45.820 --> 31:47.405
-Are we ready to see the new Abby?
-Yes.

31:47.488 --> 31:48.615
All right, here she is.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.659
Oh! [laughs]

31:51.743 --> 31:52.827
Wow.

31:54.037 --> 31:54.954
Wow.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.332
You can get all up in it,
if you wanna see.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.083
I love it.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.919
The waves are so beautiful.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.462
-They work.
-Yeah.

32:02.545 --> 32:03.379
What do you feel?

32:04.005 --> 32:05.173
Good for special occasions.

32:05.256 --> 32:09.052
Yeah. This doesn't have to be, like,
you're just, gonna do a normal day thing.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.679
And really, all I want you to do
on a daily is, like,

32:11.763 --> 32:13.348
a tiny bit of hair balm on your wet hair,

32:13.431 --> 32:15.224
-and, like, some sunscreen on your face.
-Okay.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.225
-Like, that's it.
-Yeah.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.561
Maybe a toothbrush,
a little floss or something, but yeah.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.813
-We can do that.
-Love you. Give me huggies.

32:20.897 --> 32:21.856
Thank you.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.194
Say no to climate change
and say no to frizz.

34:28.608 --> 34:29.942
[Abby] It's so beautiful.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.694
These were just regular floor bookcases,

34:31.778 --> 34:34.447
and we repurposed them
and put them on top of this credenza.

34:34.530 --> 34:37.116
Wow! Is that a dishwasher?

34:37.241 --> 34:39.869
-Yes, it's a scratch and dent piece.
-[Abby] Oh!

34:39.952 --> 34:42.580
[Bobby] It had some dents on it,
so nobody wanted it,

34:42.663 --> 34:45.208
so now, you have a working dishwasher,
and you can use less water

34:45.291 --> 34:46.292
-to do your dishes.
-Yes.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.377
-That's really incredible.
-[Abby] Yeah.

34:48.461 --> 34:51.756

can see that they can set an example

34:51.839 --> 34:54.217
for the world and everyone
that walks into their home

34:54.300 --> 34:58.096
that you can make a nice, lovely,
warm, comfortable home

-[Abby] Yes.

35:03.559 --> 35:07.021
You guys had this in a very small form
over on the other wall

35:07.105 --> 35:10.191
and that inspired me
to make it an art piece in your home

35:10.274 --> 35:11.192
and do it even bigger.

35:11.275 --> 35:14.529
Every time somebody visited,
we had them choose the color

35:14.612 --> 35:17.782
that, like, best represented them
and sign their name and the date.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.909
And now, every time people come over,

35:19.992 --> 35:21.160
-this is your guest book.
-Yes.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.496
-[Jonathan] It's just really gorgeous.
-[Tan] Yeah, it's lovely.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.581
I feel like when you're
in a really cluttered space

35:25.665 --> 35:27.792
-it's hard to completely relax.
-[Bobby] Yep.

35:27.875 --> 35:30.795
And I feel like it's gonna
be so much easier to really...

35:30.878 --> 35:33.005
-[Bobby] Yeah.
-...chill down here now.

35:33.923 --> 35:34.882
[Abby laughs] Oh.

35:34.966 --> 35:39.095
We're gonna climb Mount Everest together.
Forever.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.348
[Abby gasps, laughs] Wow!

35:42.431 --> 35:45.017
[Jonathan]
I chose all products that are non-toxic,

35:45.101 --> 35:47.645
-clean or small.
-Yeah.

35:47.728 --> 35:50.398
This has a dehydrated
quinoa protein in it

35:50.481 --> 35:52.859
that acts as a UVA and UVB filter,

35:52.942 --> 35:55.611
so this is like, literally,
sunscreen for the hair,

35:55.695 --> 35:56.779
-which I love.
-Very fun.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.906
So, I'm just gonna spray it into my hands

35:58.990 --> 36:01.868
and then just kind of come in
and scrunch it into your hair.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.495
And then you just basically
let it air-dry.

36:05.204 --> 36:06.956
I love how this looks, though.
Do you like?

36:07.039 --> 36:08.749
Yes. I love it so much.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.043
-The hair's gorgeous.
-[Jonathan] Isn't it?

36:11.127 --> 36:13.504
Gorgeous. Now we need
to balance the look out completely.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.755
-[Abby] Yeah.
-Can I see?

36:15.423 --> 36:17.049
-[Jonathan] Pretty, right?
-Oh, Jackie.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.259
-[Jonathan] It's easy.
-So easy.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.219
Beautiful and so very young. Love.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.637
-Okay, will you come with me?
-[Abby] Yes.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.139
-Thank you. Bye, Jackie.
-[Jonathan] Bye, queen.

36:24.098 --> 36:28.019
Okay, my love.
I want you to see your new closet space.

36:28.102 --> 36:30.021
Oh, my gosh.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.024
[Tan]
I love "Oh, my gosh." Go and have a look.

36:33.107 --> 36:36.736
-Wow.
-So, everything here is either thrifted,

36:36.819 --> 36:39.030
-Oh.
-vintage or sustainably sourced.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.781
They're from brands that are sustainable.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.325
[Abby] This is so beautiful.

36:42.408 --> 36:45.369
-Yay!
-[gasps] Oh, my gosh.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.121
[Tan laughs] You like it.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.372
[Abby] I love it.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.583
[Tan] I'm so glad you like it.
Okay, so I shall I show you first?

36:50.666 --> 36:53.544
There's nothing in here
that you can't potentially wear

36:53.628 --> 36:57.173
when you're either going canvassing
or going to speak in front of other people

36:57.256 --> 36:58.966
and you look a little more dressed up.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.927
-Sound good?
-Wow, those are so pretty.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.971
Skirts. Obsessed with this.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.181
Nothing's too short.

37:05.264 --> 37:07.892
-Yeah. Wow, this is beautiful.
-Isn't it so nice?

37:07.975 --> 37:10.353
And it's nice, 'cause it's, like, navy,
so I'm wearing a skirt,

37:10.436 --> 37:11.562
-but it's a little--
-Yeah.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.232
-It could be corporate or professional.
-Yes.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.483
-Do you wanna try some stuff on?
-Yeah.

37:16.108 --> 37:19.320
Everyone! It's Tan France!

37:19.403 --> 37:21.239
-[Antoni] Yeah!
-Boys, you ready?

37:21.322 --> 37:22.281
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.742
[Tan] All right, my love.
Will you join us, please?

37:25.117 --> 37:28.287
-[Antoni] Aww, so cute!
-[applause]

37:28.412 --> 37:32.625
Oh, my gosh, your bouncy waves.

37:32.708 --> 37:33.834
Look at her!

37:33.918 --> 37:35.711
-[Antoni] So cute.
-Doesn't she look beautiful?

37:35.795 --> 37:37.630
-I love that dress, queen.
-That's an adorable dress.

37:37.713 --> 37:41.050
Abby wants to look professional.
She wants to command a space,

37:41.133 --> 37:42.802
but still feel like herself.

37:42.885 --> 37:44.971
You look gorgeous in that dress.
I really like that.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.973
-Falls really beautifully--
-I'm such a badass.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.432
-[laughs] Yeah, you--
-I'm ready to go

37:48.516 --> 37:50.851
tell some fossil fuel CEOs where to go.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.103
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

37:52.186 --> 37:54.063
-[Abby] Ooh!
-[Antoni] There you go.

37:54.146 --> 37:55.773
[Tan]
You can do a full-on walk if you'd like.

37:55.856 --> 37:58.359
Yes. [laughs]

37:58.442 --> 38:00.820
-[Jonathan] Yes!
-[cheering]

38:00.903 --> 38:03.781
-Yeah!
-Yay! Yeah!

38:03.864 --> 38:05.491
[Tan] You look the cutest.

38:05.574 --> 38:09.203
-Okay, boys. Final look.
-[all] Yeah!

38:09.287 --> 38:10.955
-[Antoni] So nice.
-[Karamo] Gorgeous!

38:11.038 --> 38:12.248
-Love.
-Still youthful.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.000
-[Tan] Still very youthful.
-[Bobby] It's more professional.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.459
-[Karamo] And very strong.
-Yes.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.337
-[Karamo] Good job.
-[Antoni] A profesh skirt, a casual top,

38:18.421 --> 38:20.172
it's like the right balance.
It's still you.

38:20.256 --> 38:24.093
Do you feel like you won't be
kind of undercut for the way you look?

38:24.176 --> 38:27.305
I mean, definitely more difficult not
to take me seriously.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.390
-Yeah.
-[Tan] Absolutely.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.727
I always feel like, with work,
really put together with what I'm doing,

38:32.810 --> 38:35.479
But now I feel like you can tell
how put together I am

38:35.563 --> 38:37.565
-just by looking at me.
-Yes.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.609
[Abby] I feel like I've grown a lot,

38:40.693 --> 38:43.946
and I'm really excited
to jump back into my life

38:44.030 --> 38:48.117
in a much healthier and more positive
and, like, more productive way.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.493
I truly do believe in you.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.789
And I'm super excited to see
where everything is headed for you.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.668
Finding joy in yourself is the first step
in changing the world for the better.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.130
-Perfect.
-[Karamo] What I'm excited about

39:01.213 --> 39:02.381
is the stress-free Abby...

39:02.465 --> 39:03.299
-Sweet.
-[Abby] Yay!

39:03.382 --> 39:06.802
...who's ready to take on the world
but is also finding time for herself.

39:06.886 --> 39:09.472
[Antoni] You're gonna do it. You're gonna
be great. It's gonna be awesome.

39:09.555 --> 39:10.848
-I'm really excited.
-I'm so excited.

39:10.931 --> 39:12.058
[Karamo] She has a bright future.

39:12.141 --> 39:15.811
I feel very confident about our world
if Abby's leading it.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.356
I've loved this week with you.

39:18.439 --> 39:19.732
You are an angel.

39:19.815 --> 39:23.069
You've opened up your space to us
and yourself to us.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.071
And that's the only reason
it's gone so well,

39:25.154 --> 39:28.366
is because you were so willing
to learn and teach us at the same time.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.910
-I've loved seeing you this week. Truly.
-Thank you.

39:31.494 --> 39:35.539
And I can't let you guys leave
without finding your color

39:35.623 --> 39:37.124
-Oh!
-and signing.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.834
-[Karamo] Are we getting to sign?
-Yes!

39:38.918 --> 39:41.045
-Okay, great. Love to.
-You were guests in our home.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.254
-[Karamo] I'm down.
-[Antoni] Let's do it.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.297
[Jonathan] Yes.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.342
[Bobby] All right, Abby. On that note...

39:46.425 --> 39:48.761
-[Abby] Give me a hug.
-You're amazing. Oh!

39:48.844 --> 39:50.471
Tell everybody what your mantra is now.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.556
I am enough, and I have enough time.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.724
-Boom!
-Yeah!

39:53.808 --> 39:55.976
-There you go.
-Such a good mantra.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.229
-[Karamo] There you go.
-Goodbye, my love.

39:58.604 --> 40:01.065
-Have so much fun tonight. Bye.
-I will.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.317
-I'm so excited. Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.319
-Love that mantra.
-[Abby laughs]

40:05.736 --> 40:07.154
-Love you to pieces, queen.
-Bye.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.114
Bye.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.532
[Bobby] Let's go, guys.

40:09.615 --> 40:11.784
-Bye, Abby.
-Bye!

40:11.867 --> 40:14.495
-Oh, no!
-[Jonathan] Bye, Abby. We love you.

40:14.578 --> 40:16.831
-Bye.
-Oh, no. Wait!

40:17.206 --> 40:18.541
You guys! Come back!

40:24.380 --> 40:26.715
<i>♪ Take me away ♪</i>

40:26.799 --> 40:28.884
<i>♪ You take me away ♪</i>

40:28.968 --> 40:30.970
<i>♪ Let's go! ♪</i>

40:31.053 --> 40:32.721
<i>♪ Got you anyway ♪</i>

40:32.930 --> 40:34.765
Who's got the bushiest eyebrows?

40:34.849 --> 40:38.144
Does it look like we could be related?
We've got similar eyes.

40:38.644 --> 40:39.478
And hair.

40:39.562 --> 40:42.898
-[Antoni] Is that true, Walter?
-[Tan] What do you think he's thinking?

40:42.982 --> 40:44.108
[Antoni] You know what he's thinking?

40:44.191 --> 40:47.778
"I wonder if Abby cooked a nice dinner
for everybody."

40:47.862 --> 40:50.156
[Jonathan] Oh, my gosh! I bet that is
what he's thinking.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.699
-[Antoni] Let's find out.
-Come on.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.951
-Tanny, can I pick you up?
-I didn't wanna walk. Yes.

40:54.493 --> 40:55.786
[Jonathan] Yes, yes, yes.

40:56.328 --> 40:58.330
[Tan] Go on. Five more steps.

40:58.414 --> 40:59.874
[laughing]

41:00.708 --> 41:02.376
-[Tan] Well done.
-[Antoni] So graceful.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.296
All right, kids. Shall we watch this?
Let's see what Abby got up to.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.132
[Karamo] Aww!

41:08.215 --> 41:10.217
Waves, yes. Bob, yes.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.847
I feel like she had a moment with herself
where she was like,

41:14.930 --> 41:17.725
"Oh, I look cute."
It's like she was feeling herself there.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.737
Mm! Delicious.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.406
-Hi.
-Whoa.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.991
-[man] Sure, right, yeah.
-Oh, my God!

41:34.074 --> 41:35.117
Oh, my God.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.161
Don and Yvonne. Mom and Dad.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.664
-Wow.
-This is crazy.

41:40.748 --> 41:41.874
[Abby] Yeah.

41:41.957 --> 41:43.751
-Hi, darlin'. Hi.
-[Abby] Hi, how are you?

41:43.834 --> 41:45.794
[Jonathan]
Oh, my God. I gave her her mom's haircut.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.880
[laughing]

41:49.465 --> 41:51.258
-Look at you.
-Yeah.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.885
-[Yvonne] And the shoes.
-[Abby] I know.

41:52.968 --> 41:55.095
I've never seen you wearing jeans
that actually fit.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.639
[laughing]

41:56.764 --> 42:00.809
That's true. I know.
And a clean shirt. At the same time.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.561
-Wow. You look awesome.
-Yeah.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.146
-[Yvonne] Oh, my gosh.
-[Don] Oh, man.

42:04.230 --> 42:07.441
I love the way you can see
into the kitchen from out there,

42:07.525 --> 42:10.110
-but, like, it's functional.
-Yeah.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.988
-[Yvonne] Wait, and you made this?
-I made this. Yeah.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.823
-[Yvonne] Whoa, really?
-[Abby] Yeah.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.617
-Antoni taught me.
-[Yvonne] Oh, my God.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.536
It looks great.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.704
[Abby]
Something you'd be really excited about,

42:20.788 --> 42:24.416
I'm gonna start setting more boundaries
for work.

42:24.500 --> 42:27.711
-[Don] Oh, that's good.
-So I'm gonna work between these hours

42:27.795 --> 42:29.046
and then I'm gonna turn it off.

42:29.463 --> 42:30.673
Mm-hmm. Get it, girl.

42:30.756 --> 42:35.010
Taking more time for myself
and doing things that I love,

42:35.094 --> 42:37.972
other than Sunrise because you know
that I love Sunrise a lot.

42:38.055 --> 42:40.558
Look at her little Mom eyes,
she's like, so proud of her.

42:40.641 --> 42:41.559
[Antoni] Yeah.

42:41.642 --> 42:42.893
Do you feel less stressed?

42:42.977 --> 42:45.813
-I feel a little less stressed. Yes.
-[laughing]

42:45.896 --> 42:46.981
I feel less stressed.

42:47.064 --> 42:49.024
-[Yvonne] That's really awesome.
-Yeah.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.193
I know you guys are proud of me
for my work,

42:51.277 --> 42:55.030
but I also want you to be proud of me
for how well I'm taking care of myself.

42:55.322 --> 42:56.699
[Jonathan] No matter how busy you are,

42:56.782 --> 42:58.492
there is a way
to give yourself that self-care...

42:58.576 --> 43:00.452
-Of course there is.
-...and that nurturing you need.

43:00.536 --> 43:03.497
If she wants to save the world,
she's not gonna save the world

43:03.581 --> 43:06.125
-if she's not around to do it.
-Amen, Tanny.

43:06.208 --> 43:08.711
-We're really proud of you.
-I'll see you for a run. Yeah.

43:08.794 --> 43:09.753
[Don] Take it easy, Ab.

43:09.837 --> 43:10.713
[Abby] Bye.

43:12.715 --> 43:14.425
[woman] It's so pretty!

43:14.800 --> 43:15.759
These plants.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.636
-Oh, my God.
-Hi.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.597
Your hair looks so cute.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.848
Yes!

43:20.931 --> 43:21.765
[man] Wow!

43:21.849 --> 43:24.184
-Hi.
-[Xavier] Wow, your hair looks great.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.312
Abby.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.980
Awww.

43:28.063 --> 43:30.649
-[man] Wow. What?
-Oh, my God.

43:31.066 --> 43:32.651
What is this?

43:32.735 --> 43:33.694
[Xavier] Oh, my God.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.571
-What?
-This is insane.

43:35.654 --> 43:37.323
-Oh, my gosh.
-[man] Oh, my God.

43:37.406 --> 43:38.699
[woman] Oh, my God.

43:39.158 --> 43:42.911
I mean, it looks completely refreshed
and new, Bobby.

43:42.995 --> 43:44.413
Abby cooked.

43:44.496 --> 43:45.998
[laughing]

43:46.123 --> 43:49.418
We know that I historically
have had trouble with cooking.

43:49.835 --> 43:51.295
-Growing moments.
-Right.

43:51.795 --> 43:54.965
We're gonna treat it less as something
that can be stressful

43:55.049 --> 43:57.259
and more as, like, a time to unwind.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.762
-Right, you're supposed to enjoy cooking.
-Good job.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.513
And we have a dishwasher now.

44:01.597 --> 44:05.017
-Whoa!
-[woman] Gorgeous.

44:05.142 --> 44:05.976
The plums...

44:06.060 --> 44:08.062
[shouting]

44:08.145 --> 44:10.397
[laughing]

44:10.481 --> 44:11.398
Oh, my God.

44:11.940 --> 44:12.983
Oh, my God!

44:13.484 --> 44:14.443
Look at you!

44:15.235 --> 44:16.487
This table...

44:16.570 --> 44:18.405
We can finally all eat together!

44:18.489 --> 44:19.531
[laughing]

44:19.657 --> 44:21.784
Everyone add their names to the wall
if you haven't yet.

44:21.867 --> 44:23.285
[woman] Wow!

44:23.369 --> 44:26.288
This looks delicious. Great job, Abby.
So good.

44:26.372 --> 44:27.748
-[chattering]
-[laughing]

44:28.082 --> 44:29.375
[Grace] Everyone!

44:29.458 --> 44:32.628
-I just wanna thank Abby. Oh, my God.
-[laughing]

44:32.711 --> 44:34.713
This girl is wearing a blouse?

44:34.797 --> 44:36.423

[Antoni]
You can continue saving the world,

44:38.759 --> 44:41.261
but you have to remember the other parts
of you that bring you joy.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.889
[Grace] I feel like there's no point
fighting in a future

44:43.972 --> 44:45.557
if you can't enjoy the present.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.102
-That's corny, but you know.
-[laughing]

44:48.185 --> 44:51.980
The only way we're gonna move forward is
by being authentically who we are.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.274
I appreciate you guys all so much.

44:54.358 --> 44:58.112
I just feel, like, so taken care of
and in a community with you all.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.281
[Jonathan] We all have a part to play
in this fight against climate change,

45:01.365 --> 45:03.492
and with people like Abby
and the Sunrise Movement,

45:03.575 --> 45:05.411
I know that this is a battle we can win.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.830
We should all enjoy
this delicious eggplant.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.665
-It's so good.
-It's really good.

45:09.748 --> 45:12.710
If we all take baby steps together,

45:12.793 --> 45:15.671
we all take one huge step
for the environment.

45:15.754 --> 45:18.298
-Toast to Abby!
-[cheering]

45:20.134 --> 45:22.386
[Karamo] The only way to save the world,
save your community

45:22.469 --> 45:24.096
is getting out there and voting.

45:24.179 --> 45:26.306
You have the power. Vote!

45:26.390 --> 45:28.809
Thanks to Abby
for helping us change as well.

45:29.184 --> 45:31.437
-Yeah!
-Thanks, Abby

45:31.520 --> 45:33.522

45:39.445 --> 45:42.573
Organic waste creates methane gas
in our landfills,

45:42.656 --> 45:45.284
and our planet could use
a lot less of that.

45:45.367 --> 45:46.493
Composting is easy.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.871
Plus, you could use it as fertilizer
in your gardens.

45:48.954 --> 45:50.247
Basic rule of thumb:

45:50.330 --> 45:52.666
if it grew from the ground,
it's compostable.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.084
Eggshells are okay.

45:54.585 --> 45:58.005
But most animal products,
like meat, are not.

45:58.630 --> 46:01.967
That makes you happy, Walter. Huh?
There you go.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.428
[gasps] Yeah!

46:06.305 --> 46:09.516
Walter,
your farts are ruining the environment.
