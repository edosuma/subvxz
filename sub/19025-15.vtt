00:01.750 --> 00:03.542
(J.D.) <i>It's been 2 weeks</i>
<i>since Ben's death.</i>

00:03.625 --> 00:05.208
<i>And even though he was Jordan's brother,</i>

00:05.291 --> 00:07.792
<i>Dr. Cox was having a much harder time</i>
<i>with it than she was.</i>

00:08.291 --> 00:09.125
(light clicks)

00:09.625 --> 00:12.583
Sweetie, are you gonna lie around
on the couch again all day today?

00:12.667 --> 00:13.792
What am I supposed to do?

00:13.875 --> 00:16.375
You know what might be fun?
Cleaning yourself.

00:16.458 --> 00:18.917
I'd wash up,
but I'm afraid to go in our bathroom.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.375
Why?

00:20.458 --> 00:22.583
(J.D.) <i>Jordan's best friends</i>
<i>came to town for the funeral,</i>

00:22.667 --> 00:25.500
<i>and unfortunately for Dr. Cox,</i>
<i>they still hadn't left.</i>

00:25.583 --> 00:28.000
Since Perry won't stop using the loo
without lifting the seat,

00:28.083 --> 00:29.250
I've started to use his sink.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.333
Aren't you a little dolled up
for the movies?

00:31.417 --> 00:34.542
If little Ms. Co-dependent here
doesn't get shagged every 2 days,

00:34.625 --> 00:35.583
she gets the shakes.

00:35.667 --> 00:36.959
It's true. Look.

00:37.041 --> 00:39.583
Of course, that could be
'cause you're sober for a change.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.333
Maybe.

00:41.417 --> 00:42.458
Mmm.

00:42.542 --> 00:46.291
You silly. Are you still mad
because we tried to fix Jordan up

00:46.375 --> 00:47.333
with someone yesterday?

00:47.417 --> 00:49.083
(growls)

00:49.166 --> 00:50.083
Scary.

00:50.834 --> 00:51.667
Oh, God.

00:52.542 --> 00:55.667
(J.D.) <i>Dr. Kelso was having</i>
<i>a little female trouble of his own.</i>

00:55.750 --> 00:59.333
Dr. Kelso, the sexual harassment
around here has gotten out of control.

00:59.417 --> 01:02.291
Yesterday, somebody asked Laverne
if her boobs were made for walking.

01:02.375 --> 01:04.166
It's rude, and it makes no sense.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.250
Paris and Nicky were not amused.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.333
You named your breasts
after the Hilton sisters?

01:08.417 --> 01:10.625
-Other way around, sugar.
-Oh.

01:10.709 --> 01:16.000
Ladies, this hospital's policy on sexual
harassment is well established. Plus...

01:16.083 --> 01:17.208
I'll handle this.

01:17.291 --> 01:19.291
I think what Garfunkel here
is trying to say

01:19.375 --> 01:20.792
is that you should all take a second,

01:20.875 --> 01:23.250
think seriously
about what's really bothering you,

01:23.333 --> 01:25.417
and then have a big group
unbunching of your panties.

01:28.583 --> 01:29.959
(J.D.) <i>Every time Turk's in a hurry,</i>

01:30.041 --> 01:32.208
<i>I'm always tempted</i>
<i>to jump out and scare him.</i>

01:32.291 --> 01:34.000
<i>Well, today's the day.</i>

01:34.083 --> 01:36.792
Booga booga booga boo! Unh!

01:36.875 --> 01:40.542
<i>The reason Turk's in such a rush</i>
<i>is because he's starting a rotation</i>

01:40.625 --> 01:42.458
<i>with the hospital's new attending surgeon.</i>

01:42.542 --> 01:45.542
(sensual music playing)

01:53.792 --> 01:56.417
So... you guys my new residents?

01:57.083 --> 01:59.250
(J.D.)
<i>I could tell what they were thinking.</i>

02:00.625 --> 02:03.083
Oh, there's so much blood.

02:03.709 --> 02:05.917
I hope it doesn't get on my dress.

02:06.792 --> 02:07.875
Oh.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.166
Oh!

02:11.250 --> 02:12.875
(giggles)

02:13.583 --> 02:15.417
I'm Dr. Miller. A few quick things.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.125
Don't talk while I'm talking.
Never utter the phrase "It's Miller time,"

02:18.208 --> 02:20.542
and I don't like the smell of cologne
in my operating room.

02:20.625 --> 02:23.417
Now, I'd like to take a minute
to listen to any questions or comments

02:23.500 --> 02:25.583
that any of you might have,
and then after this minute,

02:25.667 --> 02:28.667
I never wanna hear from any of you
ever, ever, ever again. Anyone?

02:28.750 --> 02:31.917
Uh, I'm allergic to shellfish.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.041
Any other allergies? No? Great.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.583
You and unibrow, go scrub up.

02:38.625 --> 02:39.458
Ah!

02:39.542 --> 02:41.000
My waxer's in The Bahamas.

02:41.792 --> 02:42.875
Get a new one.

02:45.291 --> 02:48.667
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

02:48.750 --> 02:51.875
<i>♪ No, I know I'm no Superman ♪</i>

02:55.500 --> 02:57.125
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:00.166 --> 03:02.917
Why don't you show the girls around
while I'm at the board meeting?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.041
Love to. Newbie, I've got a job for you.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.917
No, no. No pawning them off on Radar.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.208
-They want the big boy tour.
-Oh.

03:08.291 --> 03:11.166
Hey, I've been sharing a guest room
with razor knees here

03:11.250 --> 03:12.166
for the last 2 weeks.

03:12.250 --> 03:13.291
Do you have a queen bed?

03:13.375 --> 03:16.625
Well, it would be queen
if I took my clothes off it.

03:16.709 --> 03:18.166
Ooh, he's quick.

03:18.625 --> 03:19.875
What's he like in the sack?

03:19.959 --> 03:21.208
-Quicker.
-Oh.

03:21.291 --> 03:22.250
May I be excused?

03:22.333 --> 03:23.625
You move, you die.

03:24.625 --> 03:26.500
Be nice to my friends. Bye.

03:26.583 --> 03:27.500
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.000
Okay, here's the tour.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.834
This is where the patients enter.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.709
Upstairs is where they go to die,

03:32.792 --> 03:36.208
and down in the basement is where we slide
their cold dead bodies into the wall.

03:36.291 --> 03:38.375
Oh, and that's the gift shop.

03:39.125 --> 03:41.208
Where can one get a nice gin and tonic?

03:41.291 --> 03:43.083
You know, down the street on the right

03:43.166 --> 03:45.375
they'll make an appletini
that'll knock your socks off.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.458
Right. Let's go get drunk before Pilates.

03:49.917 --> 03:50.750
Ooh.

03:51.250 --> 03:54.291
So, uh,
Jordan seems to be doin' pretty well.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.333
You know Jordan. She is a rock.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.375
How about you? How you holdin' up?

04:01.500 --> 04:03.709
I know it's been kinda tough
with Ben dying.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.667
Are you gonna talk ever?

04:08.750 --> 04:11.834
So let me go ahead
and tee this up for you, there, Annika.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.208
We are all going to die someday.

04:15.291 --> 04:17.000
For the lucky few of us,
it'll be nice and fast.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.083
But for most of us,
it'll be just as long and slow and painful

04:20.166 --> 04:21.583
as a conversation with you.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.125
-(dings)
-It was a beautiful sentiment.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.041
Yeah.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.333
Hot dog. 3 o'clock.

04:28.959 --> 04:30.375
I mean, 5 o'clock.

04:30.458 --> 04:31.625
Over there.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.875
Todd.
Todd, let's get off on the right foot.

04:36.125 --> 04:39.792
Hey, it might just be
'cause my expectations are low.

04:39.875 --> 04:42.542
But you guys did not suck
in surgery yesterday.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.792
Well,
as long as your expectations are low,

04:44.875 --> 04:46.208
maybe we should have sex.

04:46.291 --> 04:47.542
Perfect.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.083
I'm concerned about you.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.291
I think you hold us women responsible

04:51.375 --> 04:53.250
for the fact that your mommy
didn't pay attention to you,

04:53.333 --> 04:54.375
and if you don't get help,

04:54.458 --> 04:57.000
you'll eventually start
picking up prostitutes and killing them.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.208
(chuckles)
I've always wanted to say that to him!

04:59.291 --> 05:01.667
Well, now you don't have to. Ha ha.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.125
She just talked to me like I'm an idiot.

05:05.208 --> 05:06.667
Hot chick. 12 o'clock.

05:08.625 --> 05:09.917
-Wow.
-I know.

05:10.709 --> 05:13.375
Nurse Espinoza,
it's been brought to my attention

05:13.458 --> 05:15.583
that there's been
some inappropriate behavior lately.

05:15.667 --> 05:18.125
I know. I brought it to your attention.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.625
Anyway, it occurred to me
that we can't allow this to continue.

05:21.709 --> 05:25.417
It occurred to you
because I researched case studies

05:25.500 --> 05:27.458
detailing the hospital's liability

05:27.542 --> 05:31.333
instead of going to singles night
at the Korean church by my house.

05:31.417 --> 05:34.875
Ted's sad life aside, I have decided
that you are going to run

05:34.959 --> 05:36.250
a sexual harassment seminar.

05:37.041 --> 05:38.458
No one's gonna show up for that.

05:38.542 --> 05:39.875
It isn't optional.

05:39.959 --> 05:42.500
If anyone gets more than 3 complaints
here in the box...

05:43.542 --> 05:44.458
Then they have to attend.

05:52.041 --> 05:52.875
What?

05:53.583 --> 05:54.542
He was baitin' me.

06:02.291 --> 06:03.375
Seriously, how are you?

06:03.458 --> 06:04.583
Oh, my God.

06:05.166 --> 06:08.500
Look, Abby,
I didn't write to you asking for help.

06:08.583 --> 06:10.542
So if you continue on down this road,

06:10.625 --> 06:13.333
you're going to end up eating,
breathing, and relieving yourself

06:13.417 --> 06:14.875
through a tube of some kind

06:14.959 --> 06:17.583
signed "dealing with it
on his own in Kansas."

06:18.250 --> 06:20.125
I wrote Dear Abby once in seventh grade

06:20.208 --> 06:21.875
'cause I didn't have body hair
like the other guys.

06:21.959 --> 06:24.542
By the time a response
came out in Parade magazine,

06:24.625 --> 06:26.375
it was like a forest down there.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.208
Well, you know, nothing ventured...

06:29.709 --> 06:32.667
I'm looking for streamers
and a marching band.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.333
Because this will be the ceremonial
one millionth time

06:35.417 --> 06:37.542
I've had to shake off
something that you've said.

06:37.625 --> 06:38.792
(garbles)

06:38.875 --> 06:40.250
Ah. Yes.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.500
Newbie, I'm having a tough day,
and, of course, I'd love to head home.

06:43.583 --> 06:46.041
But Jordan's satanic brood
has taken over my apartment

06:46.125 --> 06:50.000
and no man in his right mind
would dare enter that place.

06:50.792 --> 06:54.333
(J.D.) <i>Hmm.</i>
<i>I should probably go to his place.</i>

06:56.000 --> 06:57.417
Agility exercises?

06:57.500 --> 07:00.875
No. I'm air-fondling Dr. Miller's boobies.

07:00.959 --> 07:02.458
Who's with me?

07:02.542 --> 07:03.375
No.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.667
Why don't you lay off Dr. Miller?

07:05.750 --> 07:07.750
And don't say,
"I'd like to lay on Dr. Miller."

07:07.834 --> 07:10.542
High five later for reading my mind.

07:10.625 --> 07:12.542
You know,
I don't think you're stupid, Todd,

07:13.083 --> 07:15.542
even though you're washing your hands
with your gloves already on.

07:16.583 --> 07:17.458
Damn it.

07:17.542 --> 07:18.875
But keep your mouth shut, okay?

07:18.959 --> 07:21.959
It's hard for Dr. Miller
being a female surgeon around here.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.291
All right. All those who are
assisting me today, step forward.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.917
Uh-uh. Not so fast, beer bong. You're out.

07:32.125 --> 07:35.000
Hello? The door was open.
(gasps)

07:35.083 --> 07:37.917
Oh, God! I'm sorry! I'm very sorry!

07:38.000 --> 07:40.291
I just came to tell you both
that I think it would be better

07:40.375 --> 07:43.458
for Dr. Cox emotionally
if you two would leave.

07:43.542 --> 07:44.583
Okay? Thank you.

07:44.667 --> 07:45.917
Just a second, darling.

07:48.417 --> 07:50.041
-Mmm.
-Of course, we will leave.

07:50.125 --> 07:53.375
But before we go,
Ali could really use a man's opinion.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.125
Does this bra make my boobs look real?

07:55.208 --> 07:57.166
-Oh, yes.
-Damn. Let's switch.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.125
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no switchies.

07:59.208 --> 08:03.041
I think we should all be happy
with the bras God gave us.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.208
I really should go.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.000
Oh, it's all right.
We were going to go to the gym,

08:06.083 --> 08:08.291
but I could just as easily
throw up instead.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.375
Or you could just give us
a workout right here.

08:10.458 --> 08:11.333
Uh...

08:12.083 --> 08:13.875
I guess I could hang for a smidge.

08:13.959 --> 08:17.333
Good. 'Cause we've got something
to tell you, right, Ali?

08:17.417 --> 08:19.959
How dare you tell us
to leave our best friend's house

08:20.041 --> 08:22.000
because you wanna kiss Perry's ass?

08:23.458 --> 08:25.500
(both growling)

08:25.583 --> 08:29.041
You know, ladies,
I'm not usually into the rough stuff.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.291
But ooh!

08:31.875 --> 08:34.542
You shall not feast on me!

08:34.625 --> 08:36.583
-I'm bored with this.
-So am I.

08:40.542 --> 08:44.166
34, 35, 36.

08:44.250 --> 08:47.709
Todd, you have 37 complaints
of sexual harassment.

08:48.458 --> 08:50.458
Mmm! Mmm.

08:51.959 --> 08:54.333
See? It's working.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.041
Well, good luck with the seminar.

08:56.125 --> 08:59.166
Oh, Dr. Kelso, you have 5.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.875
Oh! I know.
I put those in myself to prove a point.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.792
If you'll notice, all the Kelsos
are written with a lower case "K."

09:04.875 --> 09:06.667
-No, they're not.
-Well, it was worth a shot.

09:07.291 --> 09:09.500
There must be some loophole for me.

09:10.208 --> 09:11.375
Where's Ted?

09:12.625 --> 09:15.083
Great service by Reverend Kim today, huh?

09:16.166 --> 09:19.333
So you ladies doin' anything after?

<i>♪ Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh ♪</i>

09:43.875 --> 09:45.041
<i>♪ Uh-oh, hammer time ♪</i>

09:45.125 --> 09:47.166
Second, I got your back.
So why don't you cut me a little slack?

09:47.250 --> 09:48.375
You have my back.

09:48.458 --> 09:51.333
Anybody gives you trouble,
and I'll handle the guy.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.875
'Cause, uh, little old me can't.

09:53.959 --> 09:55.542
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.792
You know what's worse than the basic
knuckle-dragging scalpel jocks

09:58.875 --> 10:00.709
I usually work with? You.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.667
You are the worst kind of sexist.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.500
You're one of the sneaky ones
who prides himself

10:04.583 --> 10:07.208
on saying all the right things
when deep down, what you really think

10:07.291 --> 10:09.917
is that I am just a little girl
who needs protecting.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.041
Now I would appreciate it
if you would apologize.

10:14.625 --> 10:15.834
(J.D.) <i>Sometimes it seems like</i>

10:15.917 --> 10:18.417
<i>men and women speak</i>
<i>a completely different language.</i>

10:18.500 --> 10:21.834
Okay,
I think you all know why you're here.

10:21.917 --> 10:22.834
Player.

10:22.917 --> 10:23.917
Check it.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.375
Great stuff.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.125
Ah.

10:28.792 --> 10:29.625
(J.D.) <i>And when that happens,</i>

10:29.709 --> 10:32.417
<i>even the best of intentions</i>
<i>can be misunderstood.</i>

10:34.208 --> 10:35.458
What the hell is he doing here?

10:35.542 --> 10:38.125
Perry's little whipping boy
told us to leave town.

10:38.750 --> 10:39.792
Oh.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.166
Oh, God.

10:41.250 --> 10:44.875
(J.D.) <i>And misunderstandings,</i>
<i>well, they can lead to disaster.</i>

10:44.959 --> 10:48.000
Dr. Turk, I asked you to apologize.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.458
I have nothing to apologize for.

10:51.583 --> 10:53.375
Then get out of my O.R.

10:54.583 --> 10:55.500
Aw.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.959
Are you going to cry like a little boy?

10:59.041 --> 11:01.083
(imitates tantrum)

11:01.542 --> 11:02.959
See how I flipped it? Tch.

11:10.542 --> 11:12.792
Dr. Miller accused me of being sexist. Me!

11:13.375 --> 11:16.041
I'm marrying Carla.
Who do you think wears the pants?

11:16.125 --> 11:20.542
And the shirts and the shoes
and sometimes my underwear.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.375
-Really?
-I said nothing.

11:22.959 --> 11:25.083
Mr. Roberts likes to wear my brassieres.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.375
Hmm?

11:26.458 --> 11:27.542
Elliot, if this woman doesn't like me,

11:27.625 --> 11:30.583
it could keep me from becoming
the youngest chief of surgery in history,

11:30.667 --> 11:32.375
which could keep me from curing paralysis,

11:32.458 --> 11:35.041
which could keep me from having
my birthday be a national holiday,

11:35.125 --> 11:37.333
and everyone knows
I hate to work on my birthday!

11:39.041 --> 11:41.041
May I ask you something there, Judy?

11:41.125 --> 11:45.500
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have 3 angry, underfed women

11:45.583 --> 11:47.917
tear you several new ones for a full hour?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.333
Actually, yes.
I caught the matinee of that show.

11:50.417 --> 11:52.166
Definitely not for the whole family.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.250
Then for the last time,

11:53.333 --> 11:56.417
don't stick any part of your hairless body
into my business.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.500
Trust me.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.291
There is nothing for you to gain from it

11:59.375 --> 12:02.750
because even if you went on a cruise
to the most remote regions of the ocean

12:02.834 --> 12:05.250
and rescued my drowning, salt-soaked body

12:05.333 --> 12:07.417
in time to pump the seawater
out of my lungs

12:07.500 --> 12:09.458
and bring me back from the brink of death,

12:09.542 --> 12:13.208
I would still be upset
that the first face I saw was yours!

12:13.291 --> 12:14.667
Well, you wouldn't see my face

12:14.750 --> 12:17.083
because it would be buried in your chest
giving you the hug

12:17.166 --> 12:18.750
you've been afraid
to ask for your whole life.

12:18.834 --> 12:19.667
Huh?

12:19.750 --> 12:22.792
Now, if you don't want my help,
then, fine, I'll back off,

12:22.875 --> 12:25.041
but only because
I feel a little bit guilty.

12:25.458 --> 12:26.291
About what?

12:28.458 --> 12:29.291
Huh?

12:29.375 --> 12:31.792
Dr. Cox, you received 4 complaints

12:31.875 --> 12:34.709
about calling male residents
by girl's names.

12:34.792 --> 12:35.583
Give me that.

12:37.417 --> 12:38.917
Oh... Judy?

12:42.041 --> 12:43.500
Oh, you come here, Judy!

12:47.250 --> 12:48.458
Well done there, Bobbo.

12:49.458 --> 12:51.250
When my patients ask me
where I was all afternoon,

12:51.333 --> 12:54.875
I'll just tell them I was too busy
attending this ridiculous chat fest

12:54.959 --> 12:57.458
with you and
Dr. "What's He Overcompensating For" here.

12:57.542 --> 12:58.375
Tch.

12:58.458 --> 13:01.458
Did I say any of you boys could talk?
No, I did not.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.417
Now, this part is especially important,
so I need everyone's full attention.

13:06.208 --> 13:07.375
(whistles)

13:07.458 --> 13:08.709
You come here, you rat bastard!

13:09.792 --> 13:10.625
(whistles)

13:10.709 --> 13:11.542
Awesome.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.041
Dr. Miller. Hi.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.709
You look very nice today.

13:16.792 --> 13:19.000
Thanks. My patient just died,
but if I'm looking good, I'm psyched.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.166
No, no. It's just that you work
in a very tough specialty,

13:21.250 --> 13:23.375
and you manage
to maintain your femininity,

13:23.458 --> 13:25.959
and I find that very, um, sexy.

13:26.041 --> 13:27.208
Are you asking me out on a date?

13:27.291 --> 13:28.208
(laughs)

13:28.291 --> 13:29.500
Please. We just met.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.709
Not that I would make a difference
if we hadn't.

13:31.792 --> 13:33.375
Um, look,

13:33.458 --> 13:36.333
Dr. Turk is a really good friend of mine,
And he is not a sexist.

13:36.417 --> 13:38.083
And I know sexists.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.083
I mean, when my dad's not asking
the maid for neck rubs,

13:40.166 --> 13:41.667
he's telling me
that if I'm gonna get emotional,

13:41.750 --> 13:42.583
I should do it in a closet

13:42.667 --> 13:44.500
because no one likes to see
a hysterical woman.

13:44.583 --> 13:47.000
-There's a closet right there.
-I know. It's one of my favorites.

13:47.083 --> 13:50.125
Dr. Reid, I've seen you strutting around
this place with your can-do attitude,

13:50.208 --> 13:52.041
and I know that you think
because you're a female doctor

13:52.125 --> 13:53.875
you're part of the solution,
but you're not.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.500
Everything about you screams:

13:55.583 --> 13:57.417
"What does that cutie in radiology
think about me?"

13:57.500 --> 13:58.542
And, yes,

13:58.625 --> 14:00.834
your friend Dr. Turk,
he may ask you for relationship advice

14:00.917 --> 14:03.208
or where to get his unfortunate girlfriend
some naughty lingerie

14:03.291 --> 14:05.125
because we both know
that when it comes to gifts,

14:05.208 --> 14:06.792
women all crave a nice leather push-up bra

14:06.875 --> 14:08.875
with tassels that go around
and around and around like this.

14:08.959 --> 14:11.709
But still I ask you, is that respect?

14:12.291 --> 14:14.041
-I--
-Don't answer. I don't care.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.917
(J.D.) Waah!

14:17.000 --> 14:18.542
(Dr. Cox) Move, Barbie, move!

14:21.542 --> 14:22.875
Whoa!

14:22.959 --> 14:24.917
(J.D.) <i>Yes! He fell! I'm gonna get away.</i>

14:25.000 --> 14:26.834
<i>You know who I haven't seen today?</i>

14:26.917 --> 14:28.333
Unh!

14:28.417 --> 14:29.250
(sighs)

14:29.333 --> 14:30.291
You looking for that?

14:30.375 --> 14:31.792
Like you read about.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.667
Come here, killer. Come on.

14:33.750 --> 14:34.709
Well, uh...

14:37.166 --> 14:38.166
Spill.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.083
Dr. Cox had nothing to do
with me going to see your scary friends.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.083
I did it all on my own.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.917
I love how adult our relationship is.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.166
Fine. You want some straight shootin'?

14:47.834 --> 14:50.291
I'm glad that you're dealing
with Ben's death so well.

14:50.375 --> 14:51.792
The fact is I'm struggling.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.792
And having those 2 harpies
nesting in our home is not helping.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.750
For the life of me, Jordan,

14:56.834 --> 14:58.500
I cannot figure out
why they're still here.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.750
It is beyond me.

15:04.542 --> 15:05.375
You okay?

15:06.583 --> 15:08.291
Why don't you grow a pair, Sally?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.375
Oh, that's going in the box.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.542
(J.D. muttering)

15:17.625 --> 15:18.500
Well?

15:18.583 --> 15:21.542
I hate to quote my mother,
but Dr. Miller is so uptight,

15:21.625 --> 15:23.000
she could use a pitcher of martinis

15:23.083 --> 15:25.041
and an afternoon
on top of a smooth-chested poolboy.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.500
I knew you'd hate her.

15:26.583 --> 15:27.500
I love her.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.834
Turk, do you know what I would give
to have a female attending like her

15:30.917 --> 15:33.500
pushing me not to let the fact
that I'm a woman hold me back?

15:34.041 --> 15:36.625
I mean, you have no idea how hard it is.

15:36.709 --> 15:38.291
I have no idea?

15:38.375 --> 15:39.959
I'm not gonna fight
about whether in medicine

15:40.041 --> 15:41.125
it's harder being black or a woman.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.834
-Black!
-Woman!

15:44.500 --> 15:48.375
-Much prop, Dr. Rhodes. Go get 'em.
-Mmm.

15:48.458 --> 15:49.917
Turk, let me ask you one question.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.959
Gun to your head,
who do you think make better doctors,

15:53.417 --> 15:54.959
men or women?

15:55.834 --> 15:58.375
(breathes deeply)

15:59.208 --> 16:00.792
No!

16:00.875 --> 16:04.959
Todd, the term "melons"
is just as bad as "sweater meat."

16:05.041 --> 16:07.125
Well, then I am thoroughly confused.

16:07.208 --> 16:09.417
This is a total waste of time!

16:09.500 --> 16:12.667
And do you know why
it's a total waste of time?

16:13.333 --> 16:16.917
Well, take Bobbo here.
He's just a product of a different era.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.667
("White Rabbit"
by Jefferson Airplane playing)

16:20.750 --> 16:22.000
Lookin' foxy, Enid.

16:22.083 --> 16:22.917
Oh!

16:23.917 --> 16:25.291
Hot mama.

16:27.542 --> 16:29.709
Those were the days.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.667
And this one, God save me,

16:31.750 --> 16:35.166
I can't even imagine
what that upbringing must have been like.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.208
Boy, I'd like to take a swig
out of her jugs.

16:42.417 --> 16:44.709
Hey! I'm talkin' to you, numb-nuts.

16:44.792 --> 16:47.458
Dad! I'm listening to Annie.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.417
It is a hard-knock life.

16:52.333 --> 16:55.250
My point is that
in this tight-assed P.C. culture

16:55.333 --> 16:58.125
it is damn hard to know what's Kosher.

16:58.208 --> 17:01.125
Well, then you should try
stepping into our shoes.

17:01.208 --> 17:05.333
Even the strongest women walk around
with this thick coat of armor all day long

17:05.417 --> 17:08.458
because God forbid we should show
the slightest sign of weakness.

17:08.542 --> 17:11.250
So, just squeeze those smelly,
oversized feet into the shoes

17:11.333 --> 17:13.417
of someone you really care about.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.000
And trust me, in a heartbeat,
you'll know the right thing to do.

17:17.792 --> 17:21.417
(J.D.) <i>At that moment, Dr. Cox knew</i>
<i>why Jordan's friends were still around.</i>

17:29.458 --> 17:31.875
Oh, would you turn off the lights?
The baby doesn't know I'm here.

17:34.417 --> 17:35.375
It doesn't matter.

17:35.458 --> 17:37.542
He likes the nanny better than me anyway.

17:37.625 --> 17:38.458
Me, too.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.792
Hey, are your friends still in town
because I've been wallowing in self-pity

17:42.875 --> 17:45.333
and you need somebody to take care of you?

17:47.291 --> 17:48.166
I miss Ben.

17:52.875 --> 17:53.709
Me too.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.458
(whispering)
Oh, God, me too.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.125
(grunting)

18:05.208 --> 18:06.834
You want me to help you move that table?

18:08.792 --> 18:11.125
Not that you can't... move it.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.041
What do you want, Dr. Turk?

18:13.125 --> 18:15.083
I was just thinking about, you know,

18:15.166 --> 18:18.250
what you were saying
when I said that thing...

18:18.333 --> 18:19.875
Just say it.

18:21.583 --> 18:22.583
I'm sorry.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.500
Scrub up.

18:26.834 --> 18:28.083
So, we're cool?

18:28.667 --> 18:29.834
Ish...

18:31.250 --> 18:33.834
But you're a decent surgeon, and, uh...

18:33.917 --> 18:37.458
I'm not one to be petty,
so why don't we put on a little music?

18:37.542 --> 18:39.750
Yes. Why don't we?

18:39.834 --> 18:43.709
