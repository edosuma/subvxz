00:11.363 --> 00:14.242
Tonight, I point at some fields,

00:14.243 --> 00:17.082
Richard minces round a corner,

00:17.083 --> 00:19.883
and James describes
his ideal night in.

00:19.955 --> 00:23.131
Vomit and sputum,
and other bodily secretions.

00:28.080 --> 00:33.040
Hello, good evening.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:33.118 --> 00:36.278
Thank you. Now, we begin,

00:36.367 --> 00:39.547
we begin with the Range Rover Sport.

00:39.585 --> 00:42.664
After eight years,
it's gone out of production.

00:42.665 --> 00:45.144
They are not going to make any more.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.864
And this is a good thing,

00:46.865 --> 00:51.264
because there's always been
one major problem with it,

00:51.265 --> 00:54.185
as Richard Hammond
shall now explain.

00:59.505 --> 01:03.305
Here we are, then. The soon-to-be
deceased Range Rover Sport.

01:04.944 --> 01:08.425
There are many things
you might object to about this car.

01:09.865 --> 01:13.664
But the biggest problem
has always been very simple.

01:13.665 --> 01:16.745
It's the badge - Range Rover Sport.

01:18.065 --> 01:23.624
First of all, underneath this is
the chassis of a Land Rover Discovery

01:23.625 --> 01:24.984
so it's not a Range Rover,

01:24.985 --> 01:28.264
and because it's the chassis
of a Land Rover Discovery,

01:28.265 --> 01:30.065
it weighs nearly three tonnes.

01:31.145 --> 01:33.225
So it's not sporty either.

01:34.785 --> 01:39.584
Its success hinged on appealing
to people who didn't know that,

01:39.585 --> 01:41.185
or indeed, anything.

01:43.145 --> 01:48.224
Basically, this car was only bought
by two types of people - footballers

01:48.225 --> 01:50.825
and people
who were married to footballers.

01:52.505 --> 01:55.865
And the Sport's
stamping ground is this place.

01:57.585 --> 02:01.105
The Premier League ghetto
of Wilmslow in Cheshire.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.065 --> 02:17.144
Genuine Georgian
electric gates right there.

02:17.145 --> 02:19.785
And there. And there.

02:23.825 --> 02:25.305
Georgian security cameras.

02:28.425 --> 02:32.745
Manicured lawns, very popular
for spit-roast barbecues.

02:33.865 --> 02:36.624
Apparently, they drink
more champagne per head here

02:36.625 --> 02:38.025
than in any other county.

02:40.465 --> 02:41.825
Class.

02:47.425 --> 02:50.904
The people of Wilmslow
are going to miss this car,

02:50.905 --> 02:54.744
but before they start weeping
onto their marble breakfast bars,

02:54.745 --> 02:56.705
I have some good news.

02:57.985 --> 03:00.905
Because now there is a new one.

03:05.785 --> 03:11.784
With prices starting at Â£50,000, it's
cheaper than a proper Range Rover

03:11.785 --> 03:17.984
and because it's available with seven
seats, it's more practical, as well.

03:17.985 --> 03:20.024
But like I said at the beginning,

03:20.025 --> 03:22.504
the old Range Rover Sport
was a bit of a fraud.

03:22.505 --> 03:26.584
The question must be,
is this one really a Range Rover

03:26.585 --> 03:28.384
and is it a Sport?

03:28.385 --> 03:30.105
Let's start with that first bit.

03:33.185 --> 03:37.584
No matter how much wood and leather
it's fitted with, the mark

03:37.585 --> 03:42.265
of a real Range Rover is being able
to tackle this sort of stuff.

03:47.145 --> 03:49.945
Important work being done,
coming through.

03:52.585 --> 03:55.064
Well, the first thing
you need to know

03:55.065 --> 03:58.704
is that this is not
a Discovery in a Range Rover frock.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.984
It has the proper Range Rover chassis

04:00.985 --> 04:04.584
and the same terrain
response system, as well.

04:04.585 --> 04:07.824
This analyses the ground
you're driving over

04:07.825 --> 04:10.864
and automatically adjusts
the suspension, gearbox,

04:10.865 --> 04:12.865
brakes and engine output to suit.

04:16.985 --> 04:20.024
Big, big, almost vertical hill now!

04:24.465 --> 04:27.265
Very steep, very steep, very muddy.

04:32.825 --> 04:35.224
That is... that is a climb.

04:35.225 --> 04:36.425
Well done, you.

04:40.225 --> 04:43.864
Besides the terrain response,
there's also a computer

04:43.865 --> 04:48.345
that disconnects the anti-roll bars
to increase wheel articulation.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.304
We're over.

04:54.305 --> 04:58.904
I mean, that was a big old
cross-axling hump to get over.

04:58.905 --> 05:00.305
It didn't even notice!

05:01.985 --> 05:03.944
And there's more.

05:03.945 --> 05:06.144
Ah! Water.

05:06.145 --> 05:09.344
Good. Gives me a chance to play
with something else I have on board

05:09.345 --> 05:10.665
and that is...

05:12.145 --> 05:13.825
sonar. Kid you not!

05:20.665 --> 05:23.584
Sonar transmitters and receivers
in the door mirrors

05:23.585 --> 05:25.424
measure the depth of the water.

05:25.425 --> 05:28.145
It will make a big noise
if it's getting too deep.

05:31.825 --> 05:33.585
It's not worried, not worried.

05:36.505 --> 05:40.425
I feel like I'm driving
a luxury hotel room through a swamp.

05:41.985 --> 05:43.065
Cool.

05:45.065 --> 05:47.145
Oh-ho! That's steep!

05:54.025 --> 05:57.704
Just pretty much like it never...

05:57.705 --> 06:00.064
There, I think I've repaired that.

06:00.065 --> 06:03.504
More or less. That's how it was.

06:03.505 --> 06:04.945
Good.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.544
So, there we are.

06:07.545 --> 06:12.224
This car, in the right hands,
is very good off-road.

06:12.225 --> 06:14.664
And now, we must move on,

06:14.665 --> 06:16.905
to this bit of the badge.

06:19.865 --> 06:22.424
Welcome to Donington Park racetrack,

06:22.425 --> 06:26.624
and if the Sport is as sporty
as Land Rover claims,

06:26.625 --> 06:29.185
it should put on a good show here.

06:39.625 --> 06:42.424
Now, you can get these
with a V6 or a V8 diesel.

06:42.425 --> 06:47.384
The one I'm in is the supercharged
petrol V8 with 503-brake horsepower,

06:47.385 --> 06:49.945
so that is the power taken care of.

06:51.265 --> 06:56.264
And because it's built on
the brand-new all-aluminium chassis
of the proper Range Rover,

06:56.265 --> 06:59.945
it's getting on for half a tonne
lighter than the old Sport.

07:02.385 --> 07:06.024
That turn, lift, and then
it comes around and then bang!

07:06.025 --> 07:09.065
503-braked all four wheels
and off you go!

07:14.225 --> 07:16.464
And as well as the weight loss,

07:16.465 --> 07:19.984
the computer-controlled suspension
fights body roll,

07:19.985 --> 07:24.025
and there's an active rear diff
like you'd get on a BMW M5.

07:26.185 --> 07:28.944
It also has something called
torque vectoring,

07:28.945 --> 07:33.184
which dictates how much power is sent
to each of the wheels and when.

07:33.185 --> 07:35.664
I mean, that is supercar stuff.

07:35.665 --> 07:38.505
That's what you get
on the McLaren 12C road car.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.344
What's staggering me right now

07:42.345 --> 07:44.904
is that hurling this car
around this racetrack,

07:44.905 --> 07:49.344
it doesn't feel like I'm asking it to
do anything it doesn't want to do.

07:49.345 --> 07:50.585
It feels at home.

07:52.825 --> 07:57.065
All in all, on a track,
it's good. But how good?

07:59.145 --> 08:00.504
Well, to find out,

08:00.505 --> 08:04.824
we must, as ever, call on the help of
the world's chattiest racing driver.

08:04.825 --> 08:08.184
Today, The Stig is in
a Mini John Cooper Works GP,

08:08.185 --> 08:11.945
one of the most hardcore
hot-hatches you can buy.

08:13.225 --> 08:16.584
And now, he's going
to use it to set a lap time.

08:16.585 --> 08:19.025
When you're ready... go!

08:33.745 --> 08:35.304
Now, let's find out

08:35.304 --> 08:38.744
if that can be beaten
by the big, bulky four by four.

08:38.745 --> 08:41.865
And to oversee proceedings,
I shall ride shotgun.

08:45.505 --> 08:46.984
The beauty of this is,

08:46.985 --> 08:51.785
he has no idea what that last car
was called, no idea what he's in now.

08:52.985 --> 08:54.984
Doesn't care. No bias, you see.

08:54.985 --> 08:57.945
All he can do is
try and go as fast as he can.

09:01.265 --> 09:02.345
And we're off!

09:05.025 --> 09:09.104
Head towards the first corner, not
braking at all for the first corner.

09:09.105 --> 09:12.105
Oh, that's very,
very quick down there!

09:13.345 --> 09:15.425
Some wee might have come out there.

09:16.625 --> 09:20.104
Whoa! Brakes work. That's good.

09:20.105 --> 09:21.744
I'm not worried about putting him off

09:21.745 --> 09:25.785
because this is just like a quacking
noise for him. It's irrelevant.

09:27.785 --> 09:30.664
It's worth remembering about now

09:30.665 --> 09:33.824
that this is still
a very big, heavy car.

09:33.825 --> 09:37.185
It weighs more than
the heaviest Mercedes S-class.

09:38.265 --> 09:42.424
But even at Stig speed, the Sport
seemed to have everything in order.

09:42.425 --> 09:45.824
We should be The Leaning Tower
of Range Rover Sport right now,

09:45.825 --> 09:48.385
but somehow we're not.
It's fantastic!

09:52.305 --> 09:55.664
We just crossed over a minute.

09:55.665 --> 09:58.344
That's the longest
protracted tyre squeal

09:58.345 --> 10:00.705
in the history
of tyres and squealing.

10:02.665 --> 10:06.464
Oh, that is... My, that was flying.

10:06.465 --> 10:08.585
Chicane! That is fast.

10:12.665 --> 10:15.144
And on to the final straight.

10:15.145 --> 10:16.505
129.8 to beat.

10:21.105 --> 10:24.865
129.5. There it is.

10:28.305 --> 10:33.064
So, after years of
writing cheques it can't cash,

10:33.065 --> 10:39.425
this car has finally earned the right
to be called the Range Rover Sport.

10:46.505 --> 10:50.624
Massively better than the old one.
Massively better. Yeah.

10:50.625 --> 10:54.784
And definitely worthy now
of the Range Rover Sport badge,

10:54.785 --> 10:58.424
but I'd still prefer to have
the big proper Range Rover.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.424
No, because if you buy the big one,
you'll spend half your time

11:01.425 --> 11:03.904
wishing you'd saved 20 grand
and bought the Sport.

11:03.905 --> 11:05.904
No, because you see, the thing is,

11:05.905 --> 11:08.944
the proper Range Rover
has a split tailgate,

11:08.945 --> 11:12.544
which all Range Rovers should have.
Look. That one doesn't have this.

11:12.545 --> 11:15.344
No, but the Range Rover Sport
is better looking.

11:15.345 --> 11:18.424
It's better to drive,
and you can get it with seven seats.

11:18.425 --> 11:21.104
Yes, but when I take my dogs
for a walk, OK,

11:21.105 --> 11:22.984
they leap out and I look at that

11:22.985 --> 11:26.824
and think, "Yes! You know what,
I'll have a nice sit down."

11:26.825 --> 11:30.464
So your walks are spent sitting down?
Yeah, I like sitting down.

11:30.465 --> 11:33.584
What, so you'd spend Â£20,000
basically on a bench?

11:33.585 --> 11:35.104
Why wouldn't you buy the Sport

11:35.105 --> 11:38.385
and one of those folding chairs
from a petrol station for a quid?

11:39.865 --> 11:41.744
But it isn't just the bench.

11:41.745 --> 11:46.424
This is bigger, and bigger, as we
know, is always better than smaller.

11:46.425 --> 11:48.105
Well, not always, not in...

11:49.505 --> 11:51.264
Not in bruises, it's not.

11:51.265 --> 11:54.144
Not bruises, no. Premium Bond wins.

11:54.145 --> 11:55.744
Heart attacks.

11:55.745 --> 11:57.224
Erm...

11:57.225 --> 11:58.424
Fireworks.

11:58.425 --> 12:00.025
Unexpected bills.

12:01.705 --> 12:04.024
Ladies, can you think
of anything which is better

12:04.025 --> 12:05.905
when it's bigger than smaller?

12:07.505 --> 12:09.984
Now, the news.
And a couple of weeks ago,

12:09.985 --> 12:12.904
on the way back from the show,
going along the A3,

12:12.905 --> 12:15.784
I was held up for an hour
and a half by an accident.

12:15.785 --> 12:17.944
When I eventually
got to the front of the queue,

12:17.945 --> 12:19.664
expecting a scene of devastation,

12:19.665 --> 12:24.144
I found a Fiat 500 with the bumper
hanging off at one end...

12:24.145 --> 12:26.264
Oh, no!
Two of the three lanes closed,

12:26.265 --> 12:29.504
and then just a load of people
in uniforms sort of milling about.

12:29.505 --> 12:31.664
These people in uniform,
James, let me guess,

12:31.665 --> 12:36.104
were they by any chance Highway
Agency Traffic Enforcement Officers?

12:36.105 --> 12:39.864
Ah, yes. I knew they would be. We've
spoken about these people before

12:39.865 --> 12:41.864
and I think we should
speak about them again

12:41.865 --> 12:44.224
because they were employed
by the Highways Agency

12:44.225 --> 12:48.904
to keep the roads open, and
all they ever do is shut them. Yeah.

12:48.905 --> 12:51.824
As soon as they get their first job,
"Right, must close the road."

12:51.825 --> 12:54.104
"Dislodged door mirror?
Close the road."

12:54.105 --> 12:56.184
"Child a bit carsick?
Close the road."

12:56.185 --> 12:59.264
"Someone says they've got whiplash?
Close the road. It's serious."

12:59.265 --> 13:03.305
Whiplash, by the way,
is not a serious injury,
it's insurance fraud.

13:04.585 --> 13:07.304
And that's all they do
and they've got to be stopped.

13:07.305 --> 13:10.504
I think they should only be
allowed to close the road

13:10.505 --> 13:13.984
if certain words are being used
to describe the incident.

13:13.985 --> 13:18.904
"Inferno", "crater", "apocalyptic."

13:18.905 --> 13:20.944
"Felt in Japan." Yes.

13:20.945 --> 13:24.464
"Can't find the head." Yes, yes.

13:24.465 --> 13:27.264
If Sally Traffic says that
on the traffic report,

13:27.265 --> 13:30.904
"Can't find the head", then you
can think about closing the road.

13:30.905 --> 13:34.305
But you still have to ring somebody
for permission and that is me.

13:35.785 --> 13:38.144
I'd basically
never give them permission.

13:38.145 --> 13:41.344
I would remind them that their
job is to clear up litter. Yes.

13:41.345 --> 13:44.544
They are, as you once described,
they're basically Wombles.

13:44.545 --> 13:47.904
Yes, it's a lovely job and they
should appreciate what they've got.

13:47.905 --> 13:51.824
It's fun. They can work
underground, overground.

13:51.825 --> 13:56.144
They could make good use of the
things they find. Yes, they could.

13:56.145 --> 13:59.424
Things that everyday folk just
leave behind. What an opportunity.

13:59.425 --> 14:03.104
I think we should dress
them up like actual Wombles.

14:03.105 --> 14:07.184
Come on, who wouldn't want to see
a Womble by the side of the road?

14:07.185 --> 14:09.384
I wouldn't mind being
stopped by a Womble

14:09.385 --> 14:13.704
and it would be good for your own
safety because nobody would want
to run over a Womble, would they?

14:13.705 --> 14:15.544
You'd be careful.
You'd be heartbroken!

14:15.545 --> 14:17.384
They wouldn't need hi-vis.

14:17.385 --> 14:21.304
Now, the Royal Mail, as we know,
often issues commemorative stamps.

14:21.305 --> 14:24.664
They pick on a subject like
woodpeckers or hats or diseases.

14:24.665 --> 14:28.704
Diseases?! Anyway, they've decided
to do a range of stamps

14:28.705 --> 14:30.944
based on
classic British motoring cars.

14:30.945 --> 14:33.464
I've got some of the ones
they've done for you here.

14:33.465 --> 14:36.384
There's the Lotus Esprit. This
isn't the actual size of the stamp.

14:36.385 --> 14:39.184
I did wonder! This is a mock-up.

14:39.185 --> 14:42.865
They've got the Lotus Esprit and
they've got the Aston Martin DB5

14:44.985 --> 14:47.985
and if you don't want your letter
to get there, the MG.

14:50.065 --> 14:53.184
Oh, God, look at that, dismal.

14:53.185 --> 14:57.304
The Ford Anglia police car.
Now that is a Ford Anglia.

14:57.305 --> 15:02.904
The scariest thing I've ever done
in how many years have been testing
cars, 25 years? 80. 80 years.

15:02.905 --> 15:06.504
In 80 years, was doing an
emergency stop in one of those.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.424
My dad lost his kneecaps
in one of those.

15:08.425 --> 15:11.704
I don't mean lost them,
like, "Where are they?"
They'll be under the seat.

15:11.705 --> 15:14.184
He crashed it and they had
to take his kneecaps out,

15:14.185 --> 15:17.824
after crashing a Ford Anglia.
And now they've put it on a stamp.

15:17.825 --> 15:22.704
That's more dreadful heritage
Britain nonsense, isn't it?

15:22.705 --> 15:27.464
It gets worse, look at that one! That
is The Archers as a postage stamp.

15:27.465 --> 15:29.504
Why don't they put
something modern on it?

15:29.505 --> 15:31.824
You could put the McLaren
or the Bentley Mulsanne on it,

15:31.825 --> 15:33.624
that would be fantastic on a stamp.

15:33.625 --> 15:36.304
I mean, the French wouldn't do
a stamp that had an old bloke

15:36.305 --> 15:39.224
on a bicycle and a stripy T-shirt
with some onions, would they?

15:39.225 --> 15:40.744
That's what that is!

15:40.745 --> 15:44.224
The Germans wouldn't do a stamp with
a half-track just outside Warsaw.

15:44.225 --> 15:46.144
Exactly. No, they really wouldn't.

15:46.145 --> 15:49.304
No, Jeremy, definitely,
they wouldn't do that.

15:49.305 --> 15:50.864
They wouldn't, would they?

15:50.865 --> 15:52.824
No, anyway, let's move on.

15:52.825 --> 15:55.904
Now Mazda and Alfa Romeo
have announced they're going to do

15:55.905 --> 15:58.504
a joint project
to make a small sports car.

15:58.505 --> 16:01.464
Mazda will call theirs the MX5,

16:01.465 --> 16:04.824
Alfa will call theirs the Spider.

16:04.825 --> 16:07.384
The trouble is, Alfa Romeo
once did this in the past.

16:07.385 --> 16:09.464
They teamed up with Nissan,
remember this? Yes.

16:09.465 --> 16:12.664
They teamed up with Nissan
and we thought, what a great plan.

16:12.665 --> 16:16.984
Alfa does the styling and the
engine and then Nissan builds it.

16:16.985 --> 16:21.624
But they did it the other way
around. Yeah, they did.

16:21.625 --> 16:24.264
It was the stupidest decision
in history.

16:24.265 --> 16:27.544
This is what we got,
ladies and gentlemen. The Arna.

16:27.545 --> 16:29.304
Oh, dear.

16:29.305 --> 16:32.864
Style by Nissan,
built by Alfa Romeo.

16:32.865 --> 16:36.144
It's a bit like going to Peter
Crouch and Abbey Clancy and saying,

16:36.145 --> 16:40.424
"Right, Abbey, you take the penalty
and Peter, you model bikinis."

16:40.425 --> 16:44.464
It's that idiotic.
They couldn't be more wrong.

16:44.465 --> 16:50.224
So for this MX5/Spider, job one,
make sure Mazda build it.

16:50.225 --> 16:52.704
That's essential.
Mazda do the building.

16:52.705 --> 16:54.584
Alfa do the styling, engine?

16:54.585 --> 16:57.944
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Alfa do the engine and the styling,

16:57.945 --> 17:02.704
but welding, soldering, doing up
the bolts, that's Mazda's job.

17:02.705 --> 17:05.144
I really do want
to see this Alfa Mazda.

17:05.145 --> 17:07.584
I think
an MX5 Spider joint-venture,

17:07.585 --> 17:09.223
that could be brilliant.

17:09.224 --> 17:12.864
Now I want to move it
onto something really important.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.624
A few months ago there was a bit
of a brouhaha about town centres

17:16.625 --> 17:19.544
in Britain dying,
all the shops closing down.

17:19.545 --> 17:22.223
And we suggested
on this show that this is because

17:22.224 --> 17:25.344
you aren't really allowed
to park anywhere in a town centre,

17:25.345 --> 17:28.744
so people go to out-of-town shopping
centres, where you can park.

17:28.745 --> 17:32.424
We said they needed to relax
the parking arrangements.

17:32.425 --> 17:36.624
Well, we have a powerful ally.
Do we? Is it Barack Obama?

17:36.625 --> 17:40.424
No, not Barack Obama. Darth Vader?

17:40.425 --> 17:43.544
No, Eric Pickles. Brilliant.

17:43.545 --> 17:46.624
Who's Eric Pickles. I've no idea.
Do you not know who he is?

17:46.625 --> 17:48.264
Well, he's not Darth Vader, is he?

17:48.265 --> 17:50.144
Eric Pickles,
I can actually draw him.

17:50.145 --> 17:55.384
Cos he's got an incredibly
small face, he's got a small face

17:55.385 --> 17:58.304
and then he's got
really quite a big head.

17:58.305 --> 18:00.465
So he actually looks like that.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.784
He doesn't look like that. He does.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.584
Put a proper picture
of him on the screen.

18:08.585 --> 18:12.144
Oh, God, he looks like that.
He does look like that.

18:12.145 --> 18:16.904
That's amazing. What a fabulous
arrangement. Look at that.

18:16.905 --> 18:18.824
You can draw him,
it's really quite good.

18:18.825 --> 18:22.105
You can have your own personal
Eric Pickles on your thumb.

18:23.945 --> 18:26.305
Wow! It's Eric Pickles!

18:27.665 --> 18:29.984
That's brilliant.

18:29.985 --> 18:33.344
I like his face. That's a good face.

18:33.345 --> 18:34.944
Excellent facework.

18:34.945 --> 18:38.264
Anyway, Eric has said, OK,
and he is a government minister,

18:38.265 --> 18:42.064
he said that you should be allowed
to stop on a single yellow

18:42.065 --> 18:44.784
or a double yellow line
just for a few minutes,

18:44.785 --> 18:46.864
while you pop into a shop
to get a pint of milk.

18:46.865 --> 18:48.984
That sounds like
perfectly good common sense.

18:48.985 --> 18:51.944
"I'm just popping in to the shop,
out in a minute." Hang on, though.

18:51.945 --> 18:55.224
This is the BBC, let's not forget,
so in the interests of balance

18:55.225 --> 18:58.545
and impartiality, I will think
of why that isn't a good idea.

18:59.625 --> 19:00.745
It's a great idea.

19:02.345 --> 19:05.624
So there we are, we've addressed
all the problems and we can say,

19:05.625 --> 19:08.384
Mr Pickles,
implement it straight away

19:08.385 --> 19:10.864
or we shall park
on your substantial face.

19:10.865 --> 19:13.624
To be fair, you could get
about ten cars on there.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.624
If you look, he's got
a mini-roundabout on his chin.

19:16.625 --> 19:19.144
I like the sound of Eric Pickles.
He sounds brilliant!

19:19.145 --> 19:21.944
He talks good sense
and he's called Eric Pickles.

19:21.945 --> 19:26.024
I think we should have him on the
show in the Reasonably-Priced Car,

19:26.025 --> 19:28.064
but here's the spin,
here's the trick.

19:28.065 --> 19:31.224
We tell him the reasonably-priced
car is an Ariel Atom,

19:31.225 --> 19:34.064
because I've got a wobbly face
that goes a bit like that.

19:34.065 --> 19:39.144
Imagine what his face would be like!
It could go inside out entirely.

19:39.145 --> 19:43.985
Amazing. Who here thinks we should
get Eric Pickles on the show?

19:45.745 --> 19:48.584
Come on, Eric! Please come
on Top Gear. We want you.

19:48.585 --> 19:52.264
Moving on, a lot of carmakers
have got it into their heads

19:52.265 --> 19:56.784
that anyone who spends Â£300,000 plus
on a car will want only two seats

19:56.785 --> 19:59.824
and an absolutely
enormous top speed.

19:59.825 --> 20:02.744
The Lamborghini Aventador,
for example.

20:02.745 --> 20:06.944
And that's great, but what if you're
not really interested in speed

20:06.945 --> 20:13.024
and you want more than two seats?
Well, how about this?

20:13.025 --> 20:16.624
It is the long-awaited replacement
for the Routemaster.

20:16.625 --> 20:20.664
It costs Â£330,000 and it's known,

20:20.665 --> 20:27.144
rather unimaginatively,
as the NBFL, the new bus for London.

20:27.145 --> 20:33.544
But could it be used as
a private car, I wonder?

20:33.545 --> 20:39.745
Could this, in fact, be the NCFS,
the new car for Somerset?

20:42.865 --> 20:46.504
So, here we are and the first
problem you notice

20:46.505 --> 20:50.304
with the new London bus
is that it's a bit complicated.

20:50.305 --> 20:52.745
So you can't just get in it and go.

20:57.945 --> 21:00.025
'Fire system pressure OK.'

21:02.505 --> 21:06.185
Ignition system. Right. Here we go.

21:08.265 --> 21:09.465
Cock.

21:16.945 --> 21:20.385
'Tyre system pressure OK.' Hang on!

21:23.985 --> 21:27.265
'Tyre system pressure OK.'
Oh, bollocks.

21:30.505 --> 21:34.384
Eventually, though,
if you press absolutely everything

21:34.385 --> 21:36.785
it will actually start and set off.

21:39.025 --> 21:42.545
Look at me!
Look at my big steering wheel.

21:44.185 --> 21:46.144
Sorry!

21:46.145 --> 21:49.184
But how does it get on as a car?

21:49.185 --> 21:52.025
Well, if I'm honest,
it is quite wide.

21:54.905 --> 21:58.665
And, yeah, all right, very
occasionally the height is an issue.

22:01.345 --> 22:03.464
Cocking Nora!

22:03.465 --> 22:09.944
But even though it's 35 feet long,
it's not hard to drive at all.

22:09.945 --> 22:13.504
The steering is light
and quite direct.

22:13.505 --> 22:18.224
It lacks the crispness that you
find in, say, the Ferrari 458

22:18.225 --> 22:19.465
but it's not bad.

22:21.105 --> 22:24.824
What's more, unlike most cars
in a similar price bracket,

22:24.825 --> 22:27.464
it's extremely home-grown.

22:27.465 --> 22:30.664
It's not something that's
just been badged up over here.

22:30.665 --> 22:34.464
It's all made in Britain. The
chassis, the bodywork, the glass.

22:34.465 --> 22:38.464
It keeps British people employed,
it promotes British skill,

22:38.465 --> 22:43.144
it advertises workmanship.
This is a dead-end. Cock!

22:43.145 --> 22:45.984
How did I do...?
It didn't say dead-end

22:45.985 --> 22:47.984
at the beginning of the road.

22:47.985 --> 22:52.464
'This, then, would be a good
place to test manoeuvrability.'

22:52.465 --> 22:55.904
Right, I can go right up
to that because I'm right
at the front of the bus.

22:55.905 --> 22:58.624
'This did attract a crowd.

22:58.625 --> 23:02.224
'But if you try doing a three-point
turn in a Lamborghini,

23:02.225 --> 23:04.624
'you get a crowd, as well.'

23:04.625 --> 23:08.385
'Tyre system pressure OK.' Oh, God.

23:09.945 --> 23:11.704
Can you look at the back for me?

23:11.705 --> 23:14.064
Can you check
I don't knock a building over?

23:14.065 --> 23:15.584
It's like Victorian Britain.

23:15.585 --> 23:18.064
I've employed some children
to do something useful.

23:18.065 --> 23:23.264
'The only difference is that people
do tend to mistake this for a bus.'

23:23.265 --> 23:26.465
Mind the dog! '..and get on it.'

23:29.545 --> 23:30.585
Oi!

23:32.345 --> 23:38.664
God above! Get off, you pesky,
meddling kids. Off, off! Off, off.

23:38.665 --> 23:43.224
No mobile phones, no pressing
the button. Off, off, off, off.

23:43.225 --> 23:44.305
Stay of the bus.

23:50.065 --> 23:53.625
I've locked myself out.
I've locked myself out of the bus.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.984
'Having sorted out
the problem with pliers,

23:58.985 --> 24:03.585
'I immediately crashed into a
Volkswagen Beetle.' Yi-yi-yi!

24:04.865 --> 24:07.384
'And then I nearly hit a bridge.'

24:07.385 --> 24:09.825
4.4? We're 4.42! Ah!

24:11.665 --> 24:13.425
God, this is exhausting.

24:17.345 --> 24:20.584
But with the road ahead mercifully
free of traffic,

24:20.585 --> 24:25.704
there was time to talk about some
of the bus's high-tech features.

24:25.705 --> 24:27.744
It's a hybrid bus, this.

24:27.745 --> 24:30.984
It has a diesel engine
and it has an electric motor.

24:30.985 --> 24:33.504
The electric motor always
drives the wheels.

24:33.505 --> 24:37.224
The diesel engine generates
electricity for the batteries.

24:37.225 --> 24:39.345
So it is actually
like a Fisker Karma.

24:40.505 --> 24:43.424
The 0-60 time is not quoted.

24:43.425 --> 24:46.344
Primarily because it won't do 60.

24:46.345 --> 24:50.584
But it will accelerate at one
metre per second. And that's good.

24:50.585 --> 24:52.705
That means people standing up
won't fall over.

24:55.745 --> 24:58.184
So what about the styling?

24:58.185 --> 25:01.104
Well, it was created
by the same people

25:01.105 --> 25:04.104
who did the amazing
Olympic cauldron.

25:04.105 --> 25:06.385
And they've done
another great job on this.

25:10.265 --> 25:14.864
From the back, it looks
like Phil Oakey's haircut,
out of The Human League.

25:14.865 --> 25:17.944
All right, it is quite boxy.

25:17.945 --> 25:20.664
But that's because it's a bus.

25:20.665 --> 25:23.864
A point that becomes obvious
when you step inside.

25:23.865 --> 25:27.144
Over its lifetime, it's reckoned
that about four million people

25:27.145 --> 25:30.544
will get on and off it so it
is a bit of a collection point

25:30.545 --> 25:34.224
for vomit and sputum
and other bodily secretions.

25:34.225 --> 25:38.384
So this floor, rubberised cork
for grip, with drainage channels,

25:38.385 --> 25:40.504
so that the blood runs out.

25:40.505 --> 25:43.824
There are three doorways
and two staircases

25:43.825 --> 25:48.464
so that desperate teenagers can get
upstairs as quickly as possible.

25:48.465 --> 25:52.984
There are 16 CCTV
security cameras on board,

25:52.985 --> 25:55.784
and this upholster,
which is inspired by that used

25:55.785 --> 26:00.024
on the original Routemaster, so that
we find it comforting and familiar.

26:00.025 --> 26:02.184
And then there's this,
which I particularly like.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.664
This screen tells you
when you get on the bus

26:04.665 --> 26:06.544
whether or not the top deck is full,

26:06.545 --> 26:09.745
so you don't waste your life
going up and down the stairs.

26:11.385 --> 26:12.904
Now, handling.

26:12.905 --> 26:16.624
On a road like this, in a supercar,
you'd be clammy-handed

26:16.625 --> 26:20.624
and frightened,
but in my bus, I was very relaxed.

26:20.625 --> 26:22.225
âª Da-da, da-da-da... âª

26:24.145 --> 26:28.145
And this got me thinking. How would
the bus cope with a track day?

26:38.065 --> 26:40.904
Now you might think we're
just being deliberately silly

26:40.905 --> 26:43.024
in a Top Gear, sort of, way,
but are we?

26:43.025 --> 26:47.384
Because the NBFL has
a lot of features that you'd
want in a track day car.

26:47.385 --> 26:52.264
It's rear-engined, like a Porsche
911, it's rear wheel drive.

26:52.265 --> 26:56.505
It has massive tyres. And then
if we move down to the front...

27:01.585 --> 27:04.824
we find excellent
all-round visibility, a lofty,

27:04.825 --> 27:06.664
commanding driving position

27:06.665 --> 27:09.185
that will give me
a good view of all the bends.

27:11.905 --> 27:14.744
Unfortunately, while that
sounded good in the paddock,

27:14.745 --> 27:16.265
there were some issues.

27:20.105 --> 27:21.025
Bandits on my six.

27:25.465 --> 27:26.505
Yobbo!

27:28.785 --> 27:32.984
On the straights, for instance,
it was woefully slow.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.905
More speed!

27:39.705 --> 27:43.785
But in the corners, you could
at least behave like a bus driver.

27:45.185 --> 27:48.104
I've shut the door on the Porsche.

27:48.105 --> 27:50.905
Your Oyster card is about to expire!

27:58.225 --> 28:00.065
And across the line!

28:01.345 --> 28:03.265
Thank you.

28:06.385 --> 28:10.865
I have never enjoyed my time
on a race track as much as that.

28:13.345 --> 28:18.984
In fact, I enjoyed my whole day with
the bus. There are a few drawbacks.

28:18.985 --> 28:21.584
Parking,
fuel consumption, reversing,

28:21.585 --> 28:25.064
but all that is true
of the Bugatti Veyron, as well.

28:25.065 --> 28:28.864
On the plus side,
it's roomy, it's distinctive,

28:28.865 --> 28:31.105
and it's extremely nice to drive.

28:33.825 --> 28:37.185
All in all,
I think it would make a super car.

28:43.865 --> 28:46.824
Hang on.

28:46.825 --> 28:49.864
Hang on a minute. What?

28:49.865 --> 28:53.744
Have you completely
taken leave of your senses?

28:53.745 --> 28:58.544
Are you seriously proposing
THIS as an alternative to THIS?

28:58.545 --> 29:03.344
No, look, Hammond, let me explain.
Lord Sir Sugar, he is a wealthy man,

29:03.345 --> 29:07.264
but he's not interested in doing
nought to 60 in two seconds, is he?

29:07.265 --> 29:10.784
If he had one of these,
he could take all his mates, well,

29:10.785 --> 29:12.984
if he's got any,
and have a lovely day out.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.904
It's hardly practical, is it?

29:14.905 --> 29:18.664
No, Hammond, I think he's onto
something. Oh, for God's sake...

29:18.665 --> 29:20.904
No, no, because
if you wanted a Lexus LFA,

29:20.905 --> 29:23.624
but you'd had a papal attitude
to birth control -

29:23.625 --> 29:25.465
a lot of children - this is ideal.

29:26.985 --> 29:29.064
Exactly right.
And you don't have to drive,

29:29.065 --> 29:31.144
you could get somebody
to drive it for you.

29:31.145 --> 29:33.304
You could call him the,
I don't know, the bus driver.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.504
Oh, for crying out loud!
Hang on, how's this for an idea?

29:36.505 --> 29:39.424
You get the local authority
to buy the bus

29:39.425 --> 29:42.904
and then you can just use it now
and then in return for a small fee.

29:42.905 --> 29:45.704
No, James, that would be communism.

29:45.705 --> 29:49.504
Anyway, it's time now to put a star
in our reasonably-priced car.

29:49.505 --> 29:52.944
Now, my guest tonight is
an Australian who lives in Britain,

29:52.945 --> 29:55.744
but, unusually,
he doesn't work in a pub.

29:55.745 --> 29:59.344
Instead, he works
in the marketing department

29:59.345 --> 30:03.984
of a large energy drinks company
and he's just handed his notice in.

30:03.985 --> 30:06.465
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mark Webber.

30:11.065 --> 30:12.584
Mark Webber!

30:12.585 --> 30:14.225
How are you?

30:17.865 --> 30:21.784
Have a seat. Have a seat.

30:21.785 --> 30:25.624
One of the most popular figures,
I say, in Formula 1.

30:25.625 --> 30:28.104
Now, we have so much in common.

30:28.105 --> 30:34.544
We have the same body fat index,
I know that. Why are you laughing?

30:34.545 --> 30:36.904
Exactly the same. But the
main thing we have in common,

30:36.905 --> 30:39.824
apart from the same body fat index,

30:39.825 --> 30:43.624
is cycling.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.504
I'm now a cyclist.

30:45.505 --> 30:48.344
I hear it's a new passion for you.

30:48.345 --> 30:50.984
And you, of course,
are well-known as a cyclist.

30:50.985 --> 30:54.544
You do a lot of competing. I've
done a little bit over the years.

30:54.545 --> 30:56.744
Somebody said
you are the fittest driver.

30:56.745 --> 30:59.304
I'm in reasonable shape.
I think all the guys are fit now.

30:59.305 --> 31:01.384
If you're
the fittest Formula 1 driver,

31:01.385 --> 31:03.824
you've got to be one
of the fittest athletes.

31:03.825 --> 31:07.344
If we did lots and lots of different
challenges, I think, yeah.

31:07.345 --> 31:10.584
That would be good.
Let's get you all playing
all the different sports.

31:10.585 --> 31:11.944
Do you play football?
Ours or your silly football?

31:11.945 --> 31:13.704
We won't get
onto the Lions and Australia.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.584
We'll leave that well alone.

31:15.585 --> 31:19.184
Somebody's here. Somebody
understands what you're on about.

31:19.185 --> 31:21.705
Lions and Wallabies,
we really enjoyed that.

31:23.345 --> 31:24.305
And the Ashes.

31:26.265 --> 31:29.584
You must have really enjoyed
living here these last few years.

31:29.585 --> 31:32.024
I thought the previous Ashes
was quite a good series.

31:32.025 --> 31:35.105
I mean, all the South Africans
played well for you guys.

31:37.025 --> 31:40.264
So how much mileage have you done
on the bike? On the bike?

31:40.265 --> 31:42.664
I've done... three.

31:42.665 --> 31:44.544
Three miles.

31:44.545 --> 31:47.344
One thing I will say
about cycling is, it is, well,

31:47.345 --> 31:49.424
it's pretty dangerous.

31:49.425 --> 31:53.384
Over the years, you've had a number
of car accidents, let's be honest.

31:53.385 --> 31:55.024
If you race cars, you'll crash cars.

31:55.025 --> 31:57.664
We've got a photograph of a crash.
I believe it was at Le Mans.

31:57.665 --> 32:01.104
A still photo.
Yeah, this is you in a Mercedes.

32:01.105 --> 32:05.025
I say car crash, that is a plane
crash going on. How did that happen?

32:06.065 --> 32:09.424
Actually, in that era, the late 90s,
the cars were super unsafe,

32:09.425 --> 32:12.304
so a lot of cars were flying.
Just the regulations.

32:12.305 --> 32:14.224
So you're sitting in there,
thinking...?

32:14.225 --> 32:17.624
I'm thinking,
obviously I'm now out of control.

32:17.625 --> 32:19.865
Believe it or not,
I'm now out of control.

32:20.945 --> 32:24.984
As arrogant as us boys are,
I have now lost control of that car.

32:24.985 --> 32:29.504
That's gone. Do you find yourself
in a situation like that braking?

32:29.505 --> 32:32.705
The brake lights
will still be on, probably, yes.

32:33.905 --> 32:36.144
"Why isn't it slowing down?"

32:36.145 --> 32:39.664
And then, of course, that was
the big Formula 1 airborne one.

32:39.665 --> 32:42.264
Was that Valencia? Yeah.
It was quite a big crash.

32:42.265 --> 32:43.704
We've got the footage here,

32:43.705 --> 32:47.505
just to remind everybody of Mark,
one of your finest hours, really.

32:57.945 --> 32:59.544
Again, I find myself...

32:59.545 --> 33:01.784
What does go through
your mind apart from,

33:01.785 --> 33:04.544
"Wow, it's like a fairground ride"?

33:04.545 --> 33:08.464
You've just got to
stay away from Lotuses, mate,
that's the long and short of it.

33:08.465 --> 33:10.864
The thing about
both of those accidents,

33:10.865 --> 33:13.904
I think the first one,
you suffered a little bit of...

33:13.905 --> 33:16.464
I had some concussion, neck problems.

33:16.465 --> 33:20.224
That one, though, the one
in the Formula 1 car? I was lucky.

33:20.225 --> 33:22.704
I snapped the brake pedal,
actually. So that was about it.

33:22.705 --> 33:25.024
Which is unusual
to do from that side.

33:25.025 --> 33:27.504
A lot of power required, adrenaline.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.544
You actually broke it with your
own...? Snapped it. Just popped it.

33:30.545 --> 33:33.544
What, just with the force
of your own foot? Exactly.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.464
So you walk away from both those
accidents, which is remarkable,

33:36.465 --> 33:39.504
and yet you go cycling in 2008,

33:39.505 --> 33:44.664
bump into a Nissan Torino,
I believe. It won, mate, it won.

33:44.665 --> 33:47.624
It won. And you broke your leg?

33:47.625 --> 33:49.144
Yeah. Shoulder...

33:49.145 --> 33:53.744
Because this is what I think we need
to impress upon children watching.

33:53.745 --> 33:56.545
Don't get a bicycle.
Because they're dangerous.

33:57.985 --> 34:02.145
Now obviously, you've, as we said in
the introduction, handed notice in.

34:04.825 --> 34:07.944
Why? Where are you going?
What you going to do?

34:07.945 --> 34:09.824
Timing's right for me, mate.

34:09.824 --> 34:13.784
Bit of a break from what I've been
doing for the last 14 years.

34:13.784 --> 34:16.664
So I'm going to race
with Porsche, actually.

34:16.665 --> 34:18.784
I know you love Porsches, don't you?

34:18.784 --> 34:20.985
The 911 is such
an interesting car!

34:23.105 --> 34:26.704
No, cos what worries me,
do you think you're getting out
at the right time of Formula 1?

34:26.705 --> 34:29.224
Now that we've got the tyres
going off like they do,

34:29.225 --> 34:30.904
is that getting a bit wearisome?

34:30.905 --> 34:33.464
You're in the car, the car's
going well, you know the track,

34:33.465 --> 34:36.543
you're in the groove
and you know that if you push hard,

34:36.545 --> 34:39.224
your tyres will simply wear out
and you can't win.

34:39.225 --> 34:42.543
It is very different, mate,
from how it used to be.

34:42.545 --> 34:45.944
But that's the way it is, we've got
to learn and get on with it.

34:45.945 --> 34:49.103
But you've got to be able to push.
In Formula 1,

34:49.105 --> 34:53.184
it's about us boys absolutely on the
limits all the time. It should be.

34:53.185 --> 34:55.543
There's a big regulation change
next year.

34:55.545 --> 34:59.824
We're going to have to save fuel.
1.6 litre engines?

34:59.825 --> 35:03.744
I mean, my Ford Cortina
had a 1.6 litre engine.

35:03.745 --> 35:06.265
So are you going
to miss your team-mate?

35:14.025 --> 35:15.985
Am I going to miss Seb?

35:17.505 --> 35:21.504
Probably not a huge amount, no.

35:21.505 --> 35:24.744
In a competitive environment, there's
always going to be a bit of needle.

35:24.745 --> 35:28.584
There's a lot of history between us
two, obviously, that's gone before.

35:28.585 --> 35:33.345
Did it start in Malaysia when he
suddenly lost the ability to hear?

35:34.905 --> 35:37.784
It was basically
"Don't overtake Mark",

35:37.785 --> 35:41.464
and then he heard everything
apart from the "don't".

35:41.465 --> 35:45.185
I mean, you're an Aussie.
Have you never felt tempted to...?

35:47.025 --> 35:49.624
"This is for Gallipoli, blam!"

35:49.625 --> 35:53.104
A lot of people are saying yes.
I'm a bit concerned.

35:53.105 --> 35:56.345
My dad always says,
"You shouldn't hit boys, mate", so...

36:00.025 --> 36:01.065
Good one.

36:02.385 --> 36:05.664
Now you're here
for the second time, in fact.

36:05.665 --> 36:08.304
Different studio,
everything's a bit different.

36:08.305 --> 36:11.144
I was a bit nervous today.
Were you in the old studio? Yeah.

36:11.145 --> 36:13.265
You actually looked
half-decent back then.

36:16.945 --> 36:19.344
I've gone, I've absolutely gone.

36:19.345 --> 36:22.264
I've got grey, too, mate.
You've got grey.

36:22.265 --> 36:23.944
Richard Hammond hasn't gone grey.

36:23.945 --> 36:26.064
It's really weird.
That's incredible.

36:26.065 --> 36:28.784
I don't know how
he's keeping it at bay.

36:28.785 --> 36:32.304
Anyway, let's find out
how you got on on your laps.

36:32.305 --> 36:35.624
You came here once
before and, let's be honest...

36:35.625 --> 36:37.984
It was chucking it down
and I was nowhere.

36:37.985 --> 36:41.384
You were 1.47, but it was
the wettest day in human history.

36:41.385 --> 36:44.904
Well, today was not raining.
Very good conditions.

36:44.905 --> 36:48.664
Good conditions, the right
temperatures for a Suzuki Liana.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.264
Who'd like to have
a look at this lap?

36:51.265 --> 36:52.544
Yeah!

36:52.545 --> 36:55.425
Let's have a look. Come on, Mark.
Let's have a look at the lap.

36:57.425 --> 37:02.504
Righto, here we go.
Coming to get you.

37:02.505 --> 37:04.544
Lewis and Sebastian.

37:04.545 --> 37:08.304
Right, those are the two targets.
The first corner.

37:08.305 --> 37:12.465
Nice and wide on the way. And it is
interesting how you lot all do that.

37:13.705 --> 37:15.985
Look at the Liana, what a machine.

37:21.105 --> 37:22.944
What is it with Formula 1 drivers?

37:22.945 --> 37:25.784
Kimi was looking
at the helicopters and planes

37:25.785 --> 37:30.504
and now you're adjusting
your clothing. Where are you going?

37:30.505 --> 37:33.184
Pay attention.
The steering's very responsive.

37:33.185 --> 37:36.464
That'll help with your time.
Right, Hammerhead.

37:36.465 --> 37:39.984
Keep it tight, keep it in.
It's horrible, Hammerhead.

37:39.985 --> 37:41.824
What's that?

37:41.825 --> 37:43.904
You keep the grip up.
There's new asphalt there.

37:43.905 --> 37:45.865
It's good grip on that,
really good grip.

37:48.305 --> 37:52.344
Don't scrub any speed
through these fast ones.

37:52.345 --> 37:54.585
Turning lightly, here we go.

37:59.745 --> 38:02.704
Here we are,
the Hugh Jackman. Ooh!

38:02.705 --> 38:05.424
Cutting it nicely.

38:05.425 --> 38:08.864
How do you carry? Look how much
speed you've got going into that!

38:08.865 --> 38:11.904
That's impressive.
Well, bound to be, really.

38:11.905 --> 38:14.824
And here, no, I wouldn't
have changed down there

38:14.825 --> 38:17.545
but there we are, across the line.

38:18.985 --> 38:22.265
I just said "I wouldn't have
changed down there" to YOU!

38:24.265 --> 38:29.064
Second gear in the last corner,
second? Yeah.

38:29.065 --> 38:31.144
I use third in Gambon. Do you?

38:31.145 --> 38:34.784
Well, on the basis that it's
the end, so it doesn't really matter

38:34.785 --> 38:37.624
if you roll it or burst.
There's no weight transfer in third.

38:37.625 --> 38:40.464
I want to get the weight on the front
tyre. The weight on the front?

38:40.465 --> 38:44.304
You see, I trail break.
Trail breaking? A little bit.

38:44.305 --> 38:47.264
Still not enough inertia.
It just gets the weight of the nose.

38:47.265 --> 38:50.225
I'll give you some lessons after.
The least I can do.

38:51.345 --> 38:53.864
Anyway, where do you think?

38:53.865 --> 38:56.384
Obviously, you said you were
going for Sebastian and Lewis,

38:56.385 --> 38:59.064
who are right up at the top.
That was the goal.

38:59.065 --> 39:02.185
Well, I've got the time here. I
shall have a look. Hang on a minute.

39:03.585 --> 39:06.704
I love the way
that Formula 1 drivers, actually,

39:06.705 --> 39:11.664
it's like you really care
about this. Cos it is quite funny.

39:11.665 --> 39:15.104
I mean Rubens was really dead
chuffed when he was fastest.

39:15.105 --> 39:17.984
He was running around handing out,
"I am the beat..."

39:17.985 --> 39:20.104
He was, he gave me one.

39:20.105 --> 39:21.705
Anyway, Mark Webber...

39:23.785 --> 39:27.065
You did it. Well, I'm going
to start with the bad news.

39:28.625 --> 39:31.705
Really? Yeah. You're not fastest.

39:34.425 --> 39:38.624
So, really, once we got that one out
the way, the big question is,

39:38.625 --> 39:39.625
ze German.

39:45.305 --> 39:49.304
Did you beat ze German,
who did a 1.44 dead?

39:49.305 --> 39:52.984
It's quite tight between those three.
It is very tight in the 1.44s.

39:52.985 --> 39:56.345
It's all very tight.
So, Mark Webber, you did 1...

39:58.345 --> 39:59.784
40...

39:59.785 --> 40:01.465
The next number's important.

40:06.465 --> 40:07.825
Three. Ooh!

40:10.345 --> 40:11.385
You beat Seb.

40:14.225 --> 40:16.585
Only .2 off Lewis.

40:22.425 --> 40:23.865
That...

40:25.785 --> 40:26.825
I reckon that did it.

40:29.345 --> 40:31.984
I reckon if you'd
just taken my advice

40:31.985 --> 40:34.064
about third at the final corner.

40:34.065 --> 40:37.624
The thing is, you're not faster than
Lewis but you don't have an earring.

40:37.625 --> 40:39.824
OK. That's worth 3/10, isn't it?

40:39.825 --> 40:43.024
It's got to be 3/10,
yeah, with his earring.

40:43.025 --> 40:47.505
But you have beaten
Sebastian Vettel in the same car.

40:48.705 --> 40:50.745
Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Webber!

40:55.505 --> 40:57.064
Tremendous.

40:57.065 --> 40:58.984
Now, for years we've known

40:58.985 --> 41:02.504
that Jaguar was working
on a new small sports car.

41:02.505 --> 41:04.704
We've known that it's going
to be called the F-type

41:04.705 --> 41:07.664
and we had a pretty good idea
of what it would be like.

41:07.665 --> 41:11.064
Yeah, we knew that it was going
to be quiet and comfortable

41:11.065 --> 41:14.224
and restrained and that the interior
would be full of traditional leather

41:14.225 --> 41:17.224
and wood and moss.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.345
So were we right?

41:42.705 --> 41:45.504
In short, no.

41:45.505 --> 41:47.265
We were not right.

41:56.225 --> 41:59.745
It's an X-rated,
hardcore monster...

42:01.305 --> 42:02.865
for the terminally unhinged.

42:08.745 --> 42:13.024
It's got such a wide range
of intoxicating noises.

42:13.025 --> 42:15.985
When you change up,
it snorts like a hippo.

42:17.985 --> 42:20.745
And when you put your
foot down, it bellows.

42:22.105 --> 42:23.704
And when you take it off again...

42:23.705 --> 42:24.705
RUMBLING

42:25.785 --> 42:27.785
Have you heard
a soundtrack like that?

42:30.425 --> 42:32.665
That is the sound
of the '60s right there!

42:38.505 --> 42:40.704
And if you push this
little button here,

42:40.705 --> 42:45.585
you engage the sports exhaust
system, which makes it even louder.

42:51.985 --> 42:54.105
It's not all bark
and no bite, either.

42:56.465 --> 42:58.424
The 3L V6 engine is supercharged

42:58.425 --> 43:03.305
and delivers 375
fire-spitting horse powers.

43:05.225 --> 43:09.144
It does 0-60 in 4.8 seconds.

43:09.145 --> 43:12.025
Top speed, 171.

43:19.785 --> 43:22.505
And this isn't even
the fast version.

43:24.145 --> 43:29.504
If you want,
Jaguar will sell you a 488hp V8.

43:29.505 --> 43:31.104
I wouldn't bother, though,

43:31.105 --> 43:34.424
because at no point while I've
been driving this, have I thought,

43:34.425 --> 43:37.065
"Yeah, but I wish
it was a bit more exciting."

43:41.505 --> 43:45.424
Now, you would imagine that a car
this loud and this brutal

43:45.425 --> 43:49.064
would be as luxurious
as a Methodist's coal house.

43:49.065 --> 43:50.865
But, no.

44:01.145 --> 44:03.224
The roof can be raised or lowered,

44:03.225 --> 44:06.545
even when you're going
30 miles an hour.

44:07.785 --> 44:09.745
The switches are bronzed.

44:11.105 --> 44:12.625
The seats are electric.

44:18.505 --> 44:22.745
And you can choose what shade
of mood lighting you'd like.

44:26.785 --> 44:29.664
The interior, then,
is nicely thought out,

44:29.665 --> 44:33.705
but it is nothing
compared to the exterior.

44:36.185 --> 44:41.265
I think this is one of the
best-looking cars ever made.

44:44.305 --> 44:48.944
So, it's beautiful
and mad and thrilling and loud.

44:48.945 --> 44:50.505
And there's more.

44:52.145 --> 44:56.304
A lot of cars these days feel like
laptops, but this doesn't.

44:56.305 --> 44:58.304
Yes, you can go into the computer

44:58.305 --> 45:01.384
and alter the characteristics
of the gearbox and the engine

45:01.385 --> 45:04.184
and the steering
and suspension, but that said,

45:04.185 --> 45:06.304
there's no double clutch gearbox.

45:06.305 --> 45:09.344
It's just a smooth,
eight-speed auto.

45:09.345 --> 45:11.304
There's no six-way traction control,

45:11.305 --> 45:14.304
there's no complicated
folding metal roof.

45:14.305 --> 45:15.705
It's much simpler than that.

45:18.505 --> 45:20.584
Engine at the front,
drive to the rear

45:20.585 --> 45:23.345
and a big, smiling piece
of meat in the middle.

45:29.345 --> 45:33.184
The chassis is epic, and so are
the brakes, and so's the steering.

45:33.185 --> 45:34.504
And you've got tons of locks,

45:34.505 --> 45:37.585
so if you do get it out of shape,
it's easy to get it back again.

45:40.665 --> 45:43.705
In many ways, it puts me in mind
of a BMW M3 and that is...

45:45.985 --> 45:47.465
That is high praise.

45:50.225 --> 45:52.504
Except, it's not a BMW.

45:52.505 --> 45:53.785
It's a Jag.

45:57.265 --> 46:00.864
And I wish I could end it there,
but, unfortunately,

46:00.865 --> 46:04.785
there are one or two issues
that need mentioning.

46:13.305 --> 46:15.424
I've just done my weekly shop.

46:15.425 --> 46:17.425
I bought some jam...

46:19.665 --> 46:20.785
some milk...

46:23.185 --> 46:24.465
some sugar...

46:25.825 --> 46:26.865
and some butter.

46:28.505 --> 46:30.704
Sadly, I wasn't able
to buy any more than that,

46:30.705 --> 46:34.984
because if you buy your Jag
with a spare wheel,

46:34.985 --> 46:37.425
this is what the boot looks like.

46:39.825 --> 46:44.784
How could they have a meeting
and decide that THAT was acceptable?

46:44.785 --> 46:46.824
It's just madness!

46:46.825 --> 46:49.105
And there's another problem -
the price.

46:52.265 --> 46:57.504
I was expecting the V6 version
to cost around Â£50,000.

46:57.505 --> 47:02.304
But actually, it's almost Â£68,000.

47:02.305 --> 47:07.104
And the V8
is an eye-watering Â£80,000.

47:07.105 --> 47:10.225
But the biggest problem,
by a country mile, is the ride.

47:11.225 --> 47:14.344
This road appears
to be completely smooth,

47:14.345 --> 47:17.384
but it feels like I'm driving...

47:17.385 --> 47:20.504
No, not driving,
it feels like I'm roller-skating,

47:20.505 --> 47:22.704
over a piece of corrugated iron.

47:22.705 --> 47:24.384
It's just... urgh!

47:24.385 --> 47:27.304
And it's even worse
when you go slowly in a town.

47:27.305 --> 47:29.744
That's just unbearably harsh.

47:29.745 --> 47:32.144
And there's no need for it.

47:32.145 --> 47:36.624
When you've got a chassis this good,
you don't need hard suspension.

47:36.625 --> 47:38.945
What were they thinking of?!

47:47.025 --> 47:50.505
Happily, however, the ride does
get better the faster you go.

47:51.625 --> 47:55.225
Which means, there is
a way round the problem.

47:56.745 --> 47:58.425
Don't drive slowly.

48:00.185 --> 48:01.945
Drive fast.

48:07.465 --> 48:09.984
Let's be honest,
in a car that looks this good

48:09.985 --> 48:14.744
and sounds this fantastic,
and goes this well,

48:14.745 --> 48:17.025
that's no hardship.

48:22.345 --> 48:23.905
That is no hardship, at all.

48:34.505 --> 48:37.104
Another amazing road
in Hertfordshire.

48:37.105 --> 48:39.424
You should come there more often.

48:39.425 --> 48:45.184
Anyway, Jaguar, as I'm sure
you know, is now an Indian company,

48:45.185 --> 48:48.544
but the cars
are still made in Britain.

48:48.545 --> 48:51.384
And so are the Range Rovers
that we were talking about earlier,

48:51.385 --> 48:54.904
and so is the bus
that James thinks as a car.

48:54.905 --> 48:57.464
And that got us thinking.

48:57.465 --> 48:58.544
We're always been told

48:58.545 --> 49:00.784
that Britain's
manufacturing industry is dead,

49:00.785 --> 49:02.384
that we don't make stuff any more,

49:02.385 --> 49:05.264
and that we certainly
don't make vehicles.

49:05.265 --> 49:06.984
But, do we?

49:06.985 --> 49:09.344
Well, WE do, obviously.

49:09.345 --> 49:13.584
We made this pioneering hybrid
electric car, using technology

49:13.585 --> 49:16.224
that is now copied globally.

49:16.225 --> 49:19.824
And we made
the magnificent Hovervan,

49:19.825 --> 49:22.624
a machine of
unparalleled capabilities,

49:22.625 --> 49:25.264
many of which were not faked
in any way, at all.

49:25.265 --> 49:29.224
And then there was the superb P45.

49:29.225 --> 49:31.144
Which was terrible.

49:31.145 --> 49:32.984
Well, it had one or two issues.

49:32.985 --> 49:34.464
Yeah, it was lethal.

49:34.465 --> 49:36.464
Yeah, being lethal
was one of the issues.

49:36.465 --> 49:38.544
But it was British built.

49:38.545 --> 49:41.504
And we were wondering, what else is?

49:41.505 --> 49:45.904
And so, for the finale
of the last programme of the series,

49:45.905 --> 49:48.265
we thought we should find out.

49:53.065 --> 49:56.585
This is most people's idea
of a British car factory.

49:57.825 --> 50:05.464
A ruin that closed down after some
long-forgotten strike in the 1970s.

50:05.465 --> 50:07.664
But it turns out that, actually,

50:07.665 --> 50:10.345
there's rather more going on
than you might think.

50:15.225 --> 50:17.744
Today, a new car
rolls off a production line

50:17.745 --> 50:20.825
somewhere in Britain
every 20 seconds.

50:22.705 --> 50:25.224
Honda has a factory in Swindon,

50:25.225 --> 50:27.864
where 2,700 people are employed

50:27.865 --> 50:30.145
to make the Civic,
the Jazz, and the CRV.

50:32.945 --> 50:35.304
Toyota makes cars in Derbyshire.

50:35.305 --> 50:39.464
Cars, which are
then exported to Japan.

50:39.465 --> 50:41.664
And then there's the Nissan plant

50:41.665 --> 50:42.984
in the Northeast.

50:42.985 --> 50:45.464
Last year,
this one factory made more cars

50:45.465 --> 50:49.145
than the whole of the Italian
motor industry put together.

50:54.265 --> 50:57.664
And it's not just
whole cars we make, either.

50:57.665 --> 51:00.704
Last year, one in three Fords
sold globally

51:00.705 --> 51:05.825
had an engine made either
in Wales or here in Essex.

51:10.705 --> 51:12.225
And there's more.

51:25.225 --> 51:29.304
And then, we arrive
at the Rolls-Royce plant in Sussex,

51:29.305 --> 51:35.144
where, yes, many of the components
are shipped over from Germany.

51:35.145 --> 51:39.185
But the job of putting them
all together is done here.

51:42.905 --> 51:46.104
Because Britain is the only country
that appreciates

51:46.105 --> 51:49.104
it's better to trim the seats
with hide from bulls,

51:49.105 --> 51:52.585
because cows get stretch marks
when they're pregnant.

51:54.865 --> 51:57.344
Then you have
the people doing the wood.

51:57.345 --> 52:00.024
Grandmasters, they're called.

52:00.025 --> 52:06.945
And the paint shop, where 45 kilos
of paint is applied to each car.

52:09.865 --> 52:11.944
And then, there's this chap.

52:11.945 --> 52:13.744
It's his job
to apply the coach lines

52:13.745 --> 52:17.384
and embellishments
to the finished product...

52:17.385 --> 52:19.225
by hand.

52:21.505 --> 52:25.864
You won't find his equivalent
in a Hyundai factory.

52:25.865 --> 52:30.584
He learned his trade
as a pub sign writer.

52:30.585 --> 52:34.585
It's said he has
the steadiest hand in the world.

52:39.425 --> 52:41.025
Then, there's motor racing.

52:42.385 --> 52:46.624
In the whole world,
there are 11 Formula 1 teams.

52:46.625 --> 52:48.104
Eight are based in Britain

52:48.105 --> 52:53.144
and seven can be seen from the top
of this one hill in Oxfordshire.

52:53.145 --> 52:56.384
Over there, you have Williams.

52:56.385 --> 52:59.584
Up there in the Cotswolds,
there's Lotus and Caterham.

52:59.585 --> 53:01.064
Then, moving further along,

53:01.065 --> 53:02.744
we have Force India, Marussia,

53:02.745 --> 53:04.025
Red Bull and Mercedes.

53:08.505 --> 53:12.585
Britain's contribution
to motorsport is extraordinary.

53:15.185 --> 53:17.504
All IndyCar races,

53:17.505 --> 53:20.544
every Dakar winner since 2009,

53:20.545 --> 53:24.784
35 of the 56 starters
at this year's Le Mans,

53:24.785 --> 53:27.224
including the car that won it.

53:27.225 --> 53:30.745
The Marussia Formula 1 car,
and the Pagani Huayra.

53:32.945 --> 53:36.344
All of them have gearboxes
made in that factory

53:36.345 --> 53:39.105
on this little industrial estate
in Berkshire.

53:41.585 --> 53:45.224
A whopping 75%
of all research and development

53:45.225 --> 53:47.385
done in global motorsport
is British.

53:52.785 --> 53:54.025
British clutch.

53:55.185 --> 53:58.304
British hybrid system.

53:58.305 --> 54:00.265
British ECUs.

54:04.585 --> 54:07.944
And it's not just us saying,
"Ooh, look! Aren't we clever?"

54:07.945 --> 54:11.064
The rest of the world likes
what we're doing these days.

54:11.065 --> 54:13.424
For five out of
the last seven years,

54:13.425 --> 54:16.665
Aston Martin has been voted
"coolest brand in the world".

54:17.665 --> 54:21.905
And then, there's the list of global
celebrities who drive a Range Rover.

54:30.905 --> 54:34.945
Time now to move away from the cars
and into the heavy engineering.

54:37.025 --> 54:40.744
On this map of the world,
all the countries shaded in red

54:40.745 --> 54:44.224
use military vehicles
made in Britain.

54:44.225 --> 54:47.024
All the countries shaded green

54:47.025 --> 54:50.264
use British-made lorries
to move stuff around.

54:50.265 --> 54:52.904
In all the countries shaded yellow,

54:52.905 --> 54:56.185
there's at least one JCB
helping to build something.

54:58.185 --> 55:00.984
And while it's not exactly
heavy engineering,

55:00.985 --> 55:05.865
all the countries shaded brown
watch British-made motoring shows.

55:09.105 --> 55:12.384
Having established we do make
quite a lot of stuff in Britain,

55:12.385 --> 55:15.984
we decided to find out
just how much.

55:15.985 --> 55:18.744
So we hatched an ambitious plan.

55:18.745 --> 55:21.424
We called all the companies
that make motorised vehicles

55:21.425 --> 55:24.904
and said to them, "Could you bring
whatever it is you make

55:24.905 --> 55:26.624
"to a gathering in London?"

55:26.625 --> 55:28.944
A little bit
of a problem with Morgan,

55:28.945 --> 55:31.184
who didn't know what London was,

55:31.185 --> 55:34.865
but eventually,
everybody responded magnificently.

56:06.425 --> 56:09.744
Jeremy, Richard, and I are taking
three different versions

56:09.745 --> 56:11.304
of the new F-Type to London.

56:11.305 --> 56:13.104
I, for example, have the V6...

56:13.105 --> 56:16.105
Whoa! That's the Triumph bikes.

56:17.945 --> 56:19.025
Tremendous!

56:34.145 --> 56:36.265
Meanwhile,
deep in the countryside...

56:40.665 --> 56:42.784
Oh, look at that!

56:42.785 --> 56:45.184
And now, look what's coming!

56:45.185 --> 56:47.665
It's the Morgans. Carry on, chaps!

57:02.465 --> 57:04.064
Much later than everyone else,

57:04.065 --> 57:07.025
the Formula 1 cars
began to leave for London.

57:14.385 --> 57:17.265
Which, in Milton Keynes,
was quite a sight.

57:20.865 --> 57:22.945
And quite a sound.

57:55.785 --> 57:59.344
Eventually, the fleet of vehicles
that had been made in Britain

57:59.345 --> 58:02.265
began to arrive
on the streets of the capital.

58:10.065 --> 58:12.305
And after
the slowest had turned up...

58:14.865 --> 58:16.384
we climbed into our Jags

58:16.385 --> 58:18.784
and headed for the meeting point

58:18.785 --> 58:21.785
to see how much stuff was there.

58:24.545 --> 58:27.025
This feels a bit special, this does.

58:30.105 --> 58:32.024
And it became even more special

58:32.025 --> 58:34.184
as we swung past Buckingham Palace

58:34.185 --> 58:35.905
and onto The Mall.

58:40.185 --> 58:42.305
There's more than I thought.

58:57.905 --> 59:02.584
The Mall has hosted many
uplifting scenes over the years.

59:02.585 --> 59:07.184
But it has never hosted
anything quite like this before.

59:07.185 --> 59:11.384
It wasn't just the sheer volume
that took our breath away.

59:11.385 --> 59:14.425
It was the diversity, the breadth.

59:16.785 --> 59:20.784
Cars, lorries, diggers, racers,

59:20.785 --> 59:23.344
ice cream vans, hearses.

59:23.345 --> 59:25.704
It was magnificent.

59:25.705 --> 59:27.585
It was huge.

59:33.625 --> 59:36.024
I didn't know we made those
massive tipper trucks.

59:36.025 --> 59:37.344
Look at that that thing!

59:37.345 --> 59:40.384
A tractor.

59:40.385 --> 59:41.585
I didn't think of that.

59:44.745 --> 59:47.025
Land speed record cars!

59:48.585 --> 59:51.865
There's my bus! All right, mate?

59:57.545 --> 59:58.585
Ooh, the Eagle!

01:00:15.705 --> 01:00:18.544
A lot of people say that, today,

01:00:18.545 --> 01:00:22.344
Britain is nothing more than a bank,
or a boutique, or a busted flush,

01:00:22.345 --> 01:00:26.905
but looking at that staggering
collection back there...

01:00:28.945 --> 01:00:30.825
I'm not sure they're right.
