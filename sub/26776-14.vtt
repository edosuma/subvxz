before that hunter,
S. Thompson, catches me.

- Y'know, Biggie...

kick it out of the trap

09:27.767 --> 09:28.868
really fast before it closes.

Because Bigfoot is real,

and three-quarters years old.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.865
What is "bona fide?"

11:39.932 --> 11:41.967
- It's that little blue
checkmark next to your name

11:42.034 --> 11:44.036
that means you're better
than everyone else.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.539
- If I help you get
that checkmark

- Thanks.
- Yeah, you got it.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.636
- It was really hard
to go to the bathroom

- I don't want to hear about it.

where did the trap go?

12:32.985 --> 12:34.386
- Seriously?

12:34.453 --> 12:35.821
That's all the pine needles
you could get?

12:35.888 --> 12:37.823
- Well I could
have gotten more

12:37.890 --> 12:39.925
if maybe someone
would have helped me.

and get more pine needles!

12:46.432 --> 12:48.501
- Yes sir.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.270
- So what's the plan?

12:51.337 --> 12:53.772
- We're gonna
trap that jerk-bag hunter.

will pop out

13:00.079 --> 13:01.447

13:01.514 --> 13:02.748
and he won't even remember
that your Bigfoot.

- Oh ho ho--solid plan.

How does this trap work?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.587
- Great question, Foot.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.456
- You're gonna stand
right over there,

13:10.523 --> 13:12.558
and when the hunter sees you
he's gonna be like,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.394
"Doo do doo doo doo
there's Bigfoot!"

13:15.461 --> 13:16.362
- Yeah yeah yeah

13:16.428 --> 13:18.197
and then he's gonna walk over

13:18.264 --> 13:19.598
and stand right here--
this spot...

13:19.665 --> 13:21.100
- Right here?

13:21.167 --> 13:22.368
- Mmhmm, right where
we're standing right now.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.236
- And then Schwoz
will hit a button

13:24.303 --> 13:25.437
and he'll spring the trap.

13:25.504 --> 13:26.939
- This trap right here?
- The same.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.407
- The one we're standing
over right now.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.142
- And where is this button
that springs the trap

13:30.209 --> 13:31.877
we're standing on right now?

13:31.944 --> 13:33.445

question, Foot.
