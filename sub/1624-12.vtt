WEBVTT

00:00.594 --> 00:02.058
Earl, can you break some 20's?

00:02.059 --> 00:03.390
The big spenders at table two

00:03.391 --> 00:05.189
wanna split their $11 check three ways,

00:05.190 --> 00:08.687
even though one person
did all the eating.

00:08.688 --> 00:13.449
I was in a three-way once.
Same thing happened.

00:17.714 --> 00:20.245
Max, table ten would like the check.

00:20.246 --> 00:22.642
And don't forget to pick
up customer comment card.

00:22.643 --> 00:24.708
Customers very important.

00:24.709 --> 00:26.507
It's all about the fans.

00:26.508 --> 00:29.571
Yeah, I'm not a fan of hearing
what people have to say.

00:29.572 --> 00:31.536
For instance, what's
happening right now...

00:31.537 --> 00:33.168
Not a fan.

00:33.169 --> 00:36.233
Max, feedback from customers is
very important business tool.

00:36.234 --> 00:40.030
Perhaps we'll pump the brakes
on sour waitress attitude.

00:40.031 --> 00:42.495
There's only one tool
that can change my 'tude,

00:42.496 --> 00:43.927
But I'm gonna need two
double-a batteries.

00:43.928 --> 00:47.058
And a 20-minute break.

00:47.059 --> 00:49.489
♪ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

00:51.023 --> 00:57.083
♪ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ♪

00:57.084 --> 00:58.582
Welcome, everyone.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.314
Thanks for coming to very important.

01:00.315 --> 01:01.747
First official diner meeting.

01:01.748 --> 01:05.510
This ain't right, man.
2:00 A.M. starts Earl time.

01:05.510 --> 01:06.776
Earl, here's your brandy.

01:06.777 --> 01:10.606
Okay, we're good now.

01:10.607 --> 01:12.805
If I knew we were gonna have
staff meetings after work,

01:12.806 --> 01:16.169
I would've taken job
at T.G.I. Friday instead.

01:16.170 --> 01:19.433
Over there, they roll fast and loose.

01:19.434 --> 01:21.132
Well, this is how I roll.

01:21.133 --> 01:23.197
Yeah, short and slow.

01:23.198 --> 01:29.160
No, I roll fast and furious.
Tokyo drift style.

01:29.161 --> 01:32.723
Han, I'm starting to drift.
Can we get to the point?

01:32.724 --> 01:35.355
Max and I still have to get home
and bake cupcakes for tomorrow.

01:35.356 --> 01:38.919
We received so many excellent
comments from customers tonight.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.717
Okay, first comment.

01:40.718 --> 01:44.082
"dark-haired waitress..."
- hey!

01:44.083 --> 01:45.614
"was very rude."

01:45.615 --> 01:48.578
Hey!

01:48.579 --> 01:49.843
Max, customers are giving.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.243
Their honest opinions about diner.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.274
We need to take it seriously.

01:53.275 --> 01:58.370
"I'd like to ride the blonde
waitress like a tilt-a-whirl."

01:58.371 --> 02:01.202
Shout out!

02:01.203 --> 02:02.335
Next comment.

02:02.336 --> 02:04.366
"why does cashier wear earphones?

02:04.367 --> 02:06.065
I thought he was a dj."

02:06.066 --> 02:08.562
♪ go, earl, go, earl ♪

02:08.564 --> 02:09.794
Holla!

02:09.795 --> 02:10.895
Moving on.

02:10.895 --> 02:12.760
"this meatloaf tastes stale and dry."

02:12.761 --> 02:16.290
♪ yeah, oleg yeah, oleg ♪

02:16.291 --> 02:18.921
It also says that cook
could wear deodorant.

02:18.922 --> 02:20.954
And shirt that covers armpit.

02:20.955 --> 02:25.151
- This is on card?
- Yes.

02:25.152 --> 02:26.949
You are lying.

02:26.950 --> 02:28.848
Yes.

02:28.849 --> 02:32.445
Remind me never to be a spy with Han.

02:32.446 --> 02:35.609
So this is how you tell
me what you think of me?

02:35.610 --> 02:38.440
You hide behind outdated
method of feedback?

02:38.441 --> 02:43.470
What, I should've posted
twitpic of my face like this?

02:43.471 --> 02:48.766
Maybe I will send you a
twitpic of my meatloaf.

02:48.767 --> 02:50.997
Can you twits pick
another time to do this?

02:50.998 --> 02:52.363
I've gotta go home.

02:52.364 --> 02:53.995
I have to go home too...

02:53.996 --> 02:56.461
And cut the remaining sleeves
off of all my shirts.

02:56.462 --> 02:57.892
And then go buy more shirts.

02:57.893 --> 03:00.024
And cut the sleeves off those shirts.

03:00.025 --> 03:01.356
You must wear sleeves.

03:01.357 --> 03:02.789
Do not tell me what to do.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.987
I was working here when you
were still a dumpling.

03:04.988 --> 03:08.385
On your father's chopstick.

03:08.386 --> 03:12.182
Now this is starting to
sound like earl time.

03:20.861 --> 03:23.158
- Did it light?
- No.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.390
Try another one. The gas is on.

03:25.391 --> 03:28.455
Ah!

03:28.456 --> 03:30.686
Why are we throwing fire at an oven?

03:30.687 --> 03:32.484
Is this a poor people game?

03:32.485 --> 03:34.416
Yeah, it's called light
the broken pilot light.

03:34.417 --> 03:36.349
Without blowing our faces off!

03:36.350 --> 03:38.747
This is ridiculous.
My heart is pounding.

03:38.748 --> 03:41.445
I didn't know baking cupcakes
was an extreme sport.

03:41.446 --> 03:45.575
It's like the deadliest batch.

03:45.576 --> 03:47.107
See? A slight hint of gas in the air.

03:47.108 --> 03:49.872
Makes everything funnier.

03:49.873 --> 03:52.170
Now there's too much gas.

03:52.171 --> 03:53.602
If we threw a math in there now,

03:53.603 --> 03:55.367
I'd be out a nose or a pair
or a pair of eyebrows.

03:55.368 --> 03:56.967
And I'm not living through that again.

03:56.968 --> 03:58.632
Again?

03:58.633 --> 03:59.997
When I was a little girl,

03:59.998 --> 04:01.396
I was trying to make
a hungry man dinner.

04:01.397 --> 04:02.862
And I lit the pilot light
too soon and whoosh!

04:02.863 --> 04:04.627
No eyebrows.

04:04.628 --> 04:06.659
Had to draw them on in magic marker.

04:06.660 --> 04:11.988
Only mexican girls would talk to me.

04:11.989 --> 04:13.553
Max, we have a cupcake business.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.819
We have to tell the landlord
we need a new oven.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.916
We can't ask the
landlord for a new oven.

04:17.918 --> 04:20.615
Then he'll ask us stuff
like "who are you?

04:20.616 --> 04:21.680
"why is your name not on the lease,

04:21.682 --> 04:23.546
And where's the rent?"

04:23.547 --> 04:25.111
Well, I'll buy us one.

04:25.112 --> 04:27.909
Really?
You're gonna buy us a whole oven?

04:27.910 --> 04:32.840
We're so poor I have a sock that
I refer to as my good sock.

04:32.841 --> 04:35.737
I've been saving something
for an emergency,

04:35.738 --> 04:40.433
Like a burst appendix or
a first date bikini wax.

04:40.434 --> 04:41.866
I knew it!

04:41.867 --> 04:43.797
You have a secret stash of your
father's missing billions.

04:43.798 --> 04:45.030
We're rich!

04:45.031 --> 04:46.262
Wait, it's other people's money.

04:46.263 --> 04:48.561
Yeah, but I didn't steal it. We're rich!

04:48.562 --> 04:50.926
They're my expensive rings.

04:50.927 --> 04:52.524
So if these are your expensive rings,

04:52.525 --> 04:54.123
What's all that other stuff you wear?

04:54.124 --> 04:55.389
Cheaper copies.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.254
You never wear the good
stuff out in public.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.719
Got it, kind of like hiding
the banana republic.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.584
And wearing the gap.

05:01.585 --> 05:03.183
See how special?

05:03.184 --> 05:06.214
They're all one-of-a-kind
from thomas aristotle thomas.

05:06.215 --> 05:07.746
T-a-t. Tat.

05:07.747 --> 05:08.912
What?

05:08.913 --> 05:11.477
Tat rings.
You've never heard of tat rings?

05:11.478 --> 05:15.873
Oh! Tat rings. No.

05:15.874 --> 05:17.039
I guess it's the kind of thing.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.838
That only people in the
know know, you know?

05:18.839 --> 05:20.104
No.

05:20.105 --> 05:21.236
Make all the jokes you want,

05:21.237 --> 05:22.668
But I only have to sell one of these.

05:22.669 --> 05:23.967
And I can get us a new oven.

05:23.968 --> 05:25.800
Any ideas what kind we should get?

05:25.801 --> 05:30.695
Uh, yeah, you're not the only
one with a secret stash.

05:30.696 --> 05:33.727
It's the Bluestar.

05:33.728 --> 05:35.659
It's the tat rings of ovens.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.690
In purple!

05:37.691 --> 05:39.789
That's right, I said purple.

05:39.790 --> 05:42.354
It's the muscle car of ovens.
It's bad-ass!

05:42.355 --> 05:44.352
It's so bad-ass when I do karaoke

05:44.353 --> 05:49.615
I change the lyrics from
purple rain to purple range.

05:49.616 --> 05:52.379
Great, we'll get this one.

05:52.380 --> 05:53.978
Uh, we can't buy that.
It's too expensive.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.810
This is just something
you fantasize about.

05:55.811 --> 05:57.343
It's kitchen porn.

05:57.344 --> 05:58.941
Fine.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.607
Tomorrow we'll go to the
cash for gold store.

06:00.608 --> 06:04.637
And get a regular oven and get cookin'.

06:04.638 --> 06:07.768
I think the funny gas is gone.

06:07.769 --> 06:09.400
Must be time. I'm going in.

06:09.401 --> 06:12.797
Let me do it, my eyebrows
need to waxed anyway.

06:12.798 --> 06:18.060
Hurry up! The gas is on!
Throw the match in!

06:18.061 --> 06:22.556
- Did it light?
- No, but my foot is on fire.

06:22.557 --> 06:26.154
I'll do it.

06:34.548 --> 06:37.179
You're good.

06:42.542 --> 06:43.907
I'm sorry, but how much
longer do we have to wait.

06:43.908 --> 06:45.173
To get cash for our gold?

06:45.174 --> 06:46.839
I told you before I'm on the phone.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.103
Sit down, shut up, don't be rude.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.368
I thought she'd be nicer
from her picture.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.033
On the bus stop bench.

06:54.034 --> 06:56.730
Yeah, and where are the dollar signs?

06:56.731 --> 06:58.930
Let me see, which ring should I sell?

06:58.931 --> 07:00.828
So much history in my lap.

07:00.829 --> 07:04.525
I don't even wanna tell you
about the history in my lap.

07:04.526 --> 07:06.890
My father got me this one in london.

07:06.891 --> 07:09.055
I got this one in paris
to reward myself.

07:09.056 --> 07:10.687
For not crying during the turbulence.

07:10.688 --> 07:12.985
On the flight to paris.

07:12.986 --> 07:16.782
My mom got me a fresca when
she hit me with her car once.

07:16.783 --> 07:18.781
I got this one when I was 18.

07:18.782 --> 07:20.779
It was my very first tat. Okay, stop!

07:20.780 --> 07:23.144
This was a bad idea.
Let's get out of here.

07:23.145 --> 07:25.076
I told you before. I'm on the phone!

07:25.077 --> 07:29.473
Sit down, shut up, don't be rude.

07:29.474 --> 07:31.005
I'm only sitting down because look.

07:31.006 --> 07:33.637
She has her hand on a gun that's
strapped under the counter.

07:33.638 --> 07:35.868
She is dying to plug us.

07:35.869 --> 07:37.167
Max, what are you talking about?

07:37.168 --> 07:38.865
Why is this a bad idea?

07:38.866 --> 07:42.563
I don't want you sacrificing
your precious rings, frodo.

07:42.564 --> 07:43.862
Because if the business
doesn't work out,

07:43.863 --> 07:45.461
It'll be my fault you have nothing.

07:45.462 --> 07:46.760
And call me selfish,

07:46.761 --> 07:49.491
The only life I wanna ruin is my own.

07:49.492 --> 07:51.456
Max, the business will go up and down.

07:51.457 --> 07:52.922
That's natural.

07:52.923 --> 07:55.653
But this ring is about more than
the day to day of the business.

07:55.654 --> 07:58.684
It's about us...
And our future together.

07:58.685 --> 08:02.082
Yo, did you just ask me to marry you?

08:02.083 --> 08:05.279
You could do worse.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.944
Now, ladies, gold. Now.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.143
Come on. It's only one ring.

08:10.144 --> 08:12.940
And when it comes to us, I'm
in this for the long haul.

08:12.941 --> 08:15.705
Or until this lady shoots us.

08:15.706 --> 08:17.703
- Hi, I'm here to...
- come on! Let's go.

08:17.704 --> 08:22.299
Don't push me I'm out of nicorette.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.332
Well, you're all business, aren't you?

08:24.333 --> 08:25.897
I can respect that.

08:25.898 --> 08:27.330
I'd like to exchange a tat ring.

08:27.331 --> 08:30.061
I've never heard of a tat ring.

08:30.062 --> 08:32.558
Thomas aristotle thomas?

08:32.558 --> 08:34.058
World-famous designer?

08:34.058 --> 08:38.520
Yeah, talk down to me.
That'll make the price better.

08:38.522 --> 08:40.953
All right, I'll weight it.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.351
What's that smell?

08:42.352 --> 08:43.817
Is someone making soup in the back?

08:43.818 --> 08:46.082
None of your business.

08:46.083 --> 08:49.912
I will give you $275.

08:49.913 --> 08:52.010
It's worth $2,500.

08:52.011 --> 08:55.075
Where? In 2005?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.874
You're just taking advantage of people.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.539
Because the world economy is crashing.

08:58.540 --> 09:05.567
It's called cash for gold, not
sympathy for flat chicks.

09:05.568 --> 09:07.733
You know what? This is inappropriate.

09:07.734 --> 09:09.731
All right, I'd like to see
your business license.

09:09.732 --> 09:11.730
Maybe I'll make a call to
the chamber of commerce.

09:11.731 --> 09:15.826
- Oh, you will, huh?
- Duck! Here comes the gun!

09:15.827 --> 09:18.857
Maybe I'll make a call
to my boys in the back.

09:18.858 --> 09:23.920
Sal! Richard!

09:23.921 --> 09:26.918
Oh, hello. Let's get out of here.

09:26.919 --> 09:32.014
Are you sure?
Because I'm kinda feeling richard.

09:35.245 --> 09:36.811
Max, I was just in the ladies' room.

09:36.812 --> 09:38.276
And I had a thought.

09:38.277 --> 09:42.206
Why am I doing my lipstick in a
mirror that says "die carlos""

09:42.207 --> 09:43.706
I know how to get the
full value of the ring.

09:43.707 --> 09:45.670
We just have to take it to the
store where they sell it,

09:45.671 --> 09:47.036
And return it.

09:47.037 --> 09:49.001
Uh, and why didn't that
occur to you before?

09:49.002 --> 09:50.200
'cause I don't have the receipt.

09:50.201 --> 09:51.533
And I bought it three years ago...

09:51.534 --> 09:54.997
From another store...
In another country.

09:59.128 --> 10:01.625
The customer asked for crust
off of a turkey club.

10:01.626 --> 10:04.290
Did they say that or is
this something you say.

10:04.291 --> 10:05.789
That they said?

10:05.790 --> 10:07.121
They said it.

10:07.122 --> 10:09.585
But I say I see "screw the
bos"" sleeveless tee.

10:09.586 --> 10:11.685
I'm sorry, someone call Ripley's.

10:11.686 --> 10:16.214
There is a small mouse speaking.

10:16.215 --> 10:18.379
And I bet for sure it comes
with stinky armpits.

10:18.380 --> 10:23.342
Why don't you see for
yourself, ratatouille?

10:23.343 --> 10:25.107
I've gotta go. Fight's starting.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.038
You are stinky.

10:29.039 --> 10:30.970
So stinky my mother in
Korea called me and said,

10:30.971 --> 10:33.302
"What is that smell?"

10:33.303 --> 10:36.099
I am surprised you're
upset by man smell.

10:36.100 --> 10:39.530
Most women like you enjoy it.

10:39.531 --> 10:42.495
Yo, Max, I got 20 bucks on Han.

10:42.496 --> 10:44.992
He's scrappy.

10:44.993 --> 10:46.392
Your english is terrible.

10:46.393 --> 10:48.856
My english is less terrible
than your terrible english.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.488
What? I couldn't understand
a word you said.

10:51.489 --> 10:54.386
What? So sorry I couldn't
understand a word you said.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.217
- Excuse me, regular-sized people.

10:57.218 --> 11:02.280
I am on break until he apologizes.

11:02.281 --> 11:03.545
I think the round's over.

11:03.546 --> 11:05.644
I couldn't understand a word they said.

11:05.645 --> 11:07.708
He needs to apologize. I'm the boss.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.506
Don't let him get to you, Han.

11:10.507 --> 11:14.437
Every woman knows size doesn't matter.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.999
I like your shirt.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.564
Reminds me of the side of the
van I lost my virginity in.

11:23.565 --> 11:26.661
That little man disrespect me.

11:26.662 --> 11:32.557
He insult my food, my
english, my "hyjane."

11:32.558 --> 11:34.922
Is there anything I can
do to cheer you up?

11:34.923 --> 11:37.986
A hug would help.

11:37.987 --> 11:40.184
If I hug you, will you go back to work?

11:40.185 --> 11:43.182
Yes.

11:43.183 --> 11:45.580
- Two-second hug. I'm going in.

11:47.980 --> 11:49.577
Aww.

11:53.675 --> 11:56.073
How did you do that?
Your hands never left my back.

11:56.074 --> 11:59.203
I am david blaine of zippers.

11:59.204 --> 12:01.735
I was trying to cheer you up.

12:01.736 --> 12:05.099
You did.

12:06.398 --> 12:09.329
Wow, it's so surreal being back here.

12:09.330 --> 12:11.294
I grew up here. It was like camp for me.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.392
I learned who all the
best designers were,

12:13.393 --> 12:17.157
How to color coordinate,
how to ride a bike.

12:17.158 --> 12:19.288
They let you ride a bike here?

12:19.289 --> 12:24.218
Bitch, I owned this piece.

12:24.219 --> 12:25.584
If there's not an iguana in here,

12:25.585 --> 12:28.015
This place is stupid.

12:28.016 --> 12:30.580
Oh, my god.

12:30.581 --> 12:32.844
They are such gorgeous tat rings.

12:32.845 --> 12:35.776
- Thanks!
- Hate you! So jealous!

12:35.777 --> 12:40.439
- Thanks!
- Bye!

12:40.440 --> 12:44.835
Seeing you in your natural
habitat is truly disturbing.

12:44.836 --> 12:46.301
Hi! Can I help you?

12:46.302 --> 12:49.365
Hi! I'd like to return a ring
I got as a present here.

12:49.366 --> 12:51.097
Tat rings are so amazing.

12:51.098 --> 12:52.530
I can't believe you want to return it.

12:52.531 --> 12:55.161
Well, this one's from a
guy I'm no longer with,

12:55.162 --> 12:56.860
So it's painful to even look at.

12:56.861 --> 12:58.126
I understand.

12:58.127 --> 13:00.357
But I couldn't take it
back without a receipt.

13:00.358 --> 13:01.956
The thing is he used to hit her.

13:01.957 --> 13:03.788
Max! You did not!

13:03.789 --> 13:06.053
Caroline, it's not your fault.

13:06.054 --> 13:08.185
That's awful.

13:08.186 --> 13:10.184
I understand why you
wouldn't want this ring.

13:10.185 --> 13:11.549
I'm sure there's something I can do.

13:11.550 --> 13:16.811
It's not our fault. I mean...Your fault.

13:20.809 --> 13:23.406
Caroline Channing?

13:23.407 --> 13:24.439
Jeffrey!

13:24.440 --> 13:26.904
Surprised to see me working here?

13:26.905 --> 13:28.869
Well, I got fired from that other store.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.635
Whose name I will never mention again.

13:30.636 --> 13:32.966
After last year's
cigarette butt incident.

13:32.967 --> 13:34.431
I'm so sorry.

13:34.432 --> 13:37.062
I had no idea those menthol
slim 100s were yours.

13:37.063 --> 13:38.794
I just thought so many
butts on the ground.

13:38.795 --> 13:41.160
Outside the store was gross,
so I said something.

13:41.161 --> 13:43.758
Well, that one comment from
the great Caroline Channing.

13:43.759 --> 13:47.055
About those butts fired my little butt.

13:47.056 --> 13:49.487
You'd be happy to know
that I quite smoking.

13:49.488 --> 13:52.951
After you got me fired.
Couldn't afford it.

13:52.952 --> 13:55.283
I also couldn't afford
my gym membership.

13:55.284 --> 13:57.014
Which is why my fired
little butt got massive,

13:57.015 --> 14:01.411
Why no one wanted to date me, and
why I spent gay pride alone.

14:01.412 --> 14:04.076
Fortunately, I wound up working here.

14:04.077 --> 14:07.740
Yeah, it all worked out.
Your butt looks tight.

14:07.741 --> 14:09.705
It's halfway there.

14:09.706 --> 14:12.170
So I got the price on the ring.

14:12.171 --> 14:15.534
You're buying a ring? A tat ring?

14:15.535 --> 14:17.133
Actually, I'm returning.

14:17.134 --> 14:20.797
Oh, can I see the receipt?

14:20.798 --> 14:25.559
As manager of the jewelry department,

14:25.560 --> 14:28.291
I couldn't possibly return
a ring that you bought.

14:28.292 --> 14:32.021
At least three years
ago without a receipt.

14:32.022 --> 14:35.385
You wouldn't want me to lose
my job again, would you?

14:35.386 --> 14:39.050
I got this, donna.

14:39.051 --> 14:41.048
And so sorry to hear about
your father being a criminal.

14:41.049 --> 14:43.613
And you being penniless
and all that ugliness.

14:43.614 --> 14:44.945
But it is kinda karma.

14:44.946 --> 14:47.876
You are where you are now,
and I'm back on top.

14:47.877 --> 14:49.842
Look, jeffrey, I know we just met,

14:49.843 --> 14:55.004
But there's no way you're a top.

14:59.535 --> 15:01.233
Now what are we gonna do?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.132
We should hunt down that
super fake jealous lady.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.864
Who hates you.

15:04.865 --> 15:06.162
Maybe she'll buy one.

15:06.163 --> 15:07.961
Max, that's brilliant.

15:07.962 --> 15:09.793
If anybody's gonna buy a tat ring,

15:09.794 --> 15:11.525
They're already in the store.

15:11.526 --> 15:13.024
We can have a pop-up sale!

15:13.025 --> 15:14.523
- A pop-up sale?

15:14.524 --> 15:16.189
- You don't know what a pop-up sale is?

15:16.190 --> 15:18.719
You didn't know what a pilot light was.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.952
it's the new trend.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.651
Mini stores pop up and sell stuff,

15:21.652 --> 15:22.983
Then they're gone.

15:22.984 --> 15:24.249
That's not a new trend.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.580
Drug dealers have been
doing that for years.

15:27.581 --> 15:30.710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

15:30.711 --> 15:32.709
What are you doing, beautiful mind?

15:32.710 --> 15:34.741
I'm mentally scanning the
layout of the store.

15:34.742 --> 15:36.107
For security cameras.

15:36.108 --> 15:37.872
I knew coming here and not
going to parks as a child.

15:37.873 --> 15:39.304
Would pay off.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.136
Okay, there's only one place
we could pull it off.

15:41.137 --> 15:42.436
Where there are no cameras.

15:42.437 --> 15:43.901
Where?

15:43.902 --> 15:47.032
- Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.197
That's right, ma'am!

15:49.198 --> 15:51.694
I said pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

15:51.695 --> 15:53.393
I don't do improv.

15:56.526 --> 15:58.723
So did we sell the ring yet?

15:58.724 --> 16:00.321
Those women weren't
our target customers.

16:00.322 --> 16:02.720
We're looking for a very specific type.

16:02.721 --> 16:05.318
Too much style and money to burn.

16:05.319 --> 16:07.849
hold the elevator!

16:10.515 --> 16:12.713
and I love new york!

16:12.714 --> 16:15.577
Pop-up sale in the ladies' room.

16:21.690 --> 16:22.989
I'll take you in two at a time.

16:22.990 --> 16:24.254
Let me go check with my associate.

16:24.255 --> 16:28.118
And I'll be right back
for adin and lublubah.

16:28.119 --> 16:29.383
Such a good memory.

16:29.384 --> 16:32.947
Hard to forget such beautiful names.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.046
Ready?

16:34.047 --> 16:36.878
We have a pooper in stall two.

16:36.879 --> 16:40.675
Who shops and plops? I mean, really.

16:40.676 --> 16:44.838
- Trust me, I smell the match.
Classic shop and plop cover-up.

16:44.839 --> 16:47.070
Where are the two Kit Kats we
got from the vending machine?

16:47.071 --> 16:49.069
I told you I was hungry.

16:49.070 --> 16:51.467
Arabic women expect a gift
when they buy something.

16:51.468 --> 16:52.633
Well, stall number two.

16:52.634 --> 16:56.030
Will probably supply a little present.

16:56.031 --> 16:57.596
- Hi, are you here for the pop-up sale?

16:57.597 --> 16:59.128
- No, I just have to pee.
- Oh, geez.

16:59.129 --> 17:01.459
Come on, don't waste my time!

17:01.460 --> 17:03.391
One stall's open... in and out!
Running a business!

17:03.392 --> 17:06.289
That woman pushed ahead of us.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.621
Do not sell her my tat ring.

17:07.622 --> 17:09.121
It's fun. You're here to pick up.

17:09.122 --> 17:12.717
She's here to drop off.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.116
Open the shop.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.214
We're a good team.

17:16.215 --> 17:17.681
You set 'em up, I knock 'em down.

17:17.682 --> 17:21.544
- Why is?
- I don't know, it just is.

17:21.545 --> 17:23.608
Are you here for the pop-up sale?

17:23.609 --> 17:25.508
- A pop-sale in the bathroom?

17:25.509 --> 17:27.739
So lame. So lame.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.004
Caroline? Jen, Robin!

17:30.005 --> 17:31.304
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

17:31.305 --> 17:34.001
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god.

17:34.002 --> 17:37.199
- Excuse me.
When will pop-up sale start?

17:37.200 --> 17:41.130
We have lunch reservations for
five at Four Seasons at 3:00.

17:41.131 --> 17:42.961
Why are you asking me?

17:42.962 --> 17:45.660
- You two are doing pop-up sale, no?

17:45.661 --> 17:47.158
No.

17:47.159 --> 17:50.556
I have nothing to do with this
pop-up sale in the bathroom.

17:50.557 --> 17:51.922
- So lame.
- So lame.

17:51.923 --> 17:53.153
So lame!

17:53.154 --> 17:54.486
So lame.

17:54.487 --> 17:55.752
Come to lunch with us.

17:55.753 --> 17:56.784
Oh, I've already eaten.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.450
Our treat.

17:58.451 --> 17:59.582
We are not taking no for an answer.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.048
They're not taking no for an answer.

18:01.049 --> 18:02.313
Sell the ring.

18:02.314 --> 18:05.677
Where is she going?
I thought you two were a team.

18:05.678 --> 18:08.642
Apparently not.

18:10.708 --> 18:12.006
So sorry.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.771
I got caught up in a
hostage nicoise situation.

18:14.772 --> 18:15.770
How'd it go?

18:15.771 --> 18:16.969
Did you get full price for the ring?

18:16.970 --> 18:19.700
Oh, do you know me?

18:19.701 --> 18:21.865
Because I could've sworn
you didn't know me.

18:21.866 --> 18:24.897
My new friends Adin and Lablueballs.

18:24.898 --> 18:26.295
Thought it was weird that
you just bailed on me.

18:26.296 --> 18:28.428
Max, I panicked in the moment.

18:28.429 --> 18:29.926
I didn't want those
girls telling everyone

18:29.927 --> 18:32.891
that Caroline Channing was in a
bathroom selling her jewelry.

18:32.892 --> 18:35.488
I'm barely back on my feet
after the whole scandal.

18:35.489 --> 18:39.485
I just couldn't bare it.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.151
Here.

18:41.152 --> 18:42.617
I didn't sell them because
I didn't buy the whole

18:42.618 --> 18:45.081
"in it for the long haul"
thing from the beginning.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.813
And I was right because
I'm always right.

18:46.814 --> 18:48.979
About people in the long haul.

18:48.980 --> 18:50.677
Max, I'm talking to you.

18:50.678 --> 18:52.742
It's cool. We don't need to talk.

18:56.940 --> 18:59.504
Max, about the rings, I'm sorry.

18:59.505 --> 19:00.736
I don't know what else to say.

19:00.737 --> 19:02.235
You don't need to say anything.

19:02.236 --> 19:04.267
You already said a lot of words
about the future and us,

19:04.268 --> 19:07.065
And then next thing I know,
you were "oh, my god!"

19:07.066 --> 19:08.897
Off to lunch with your friends.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.795
Max, I am in this for the long haul.

19:10.796 --> 19:12.694
Isn't there anything I can
say to convince you of that?

19:12.695 --> 19:14.859
Nope. And it's fine.

19:14.860 --> 19:16.358
It's not you, it's me.

19:16.359 --> 19:17.623
I'm the idiot who actually
believed for a minute.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.789
That we had a future.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.255
But it's okay.

19:20.256 --> 19:22.620
We'll just keep getting by like
we are, for the short haul.

19:22.621 --> 19:24.185
Cool?

19:24.186 --> 19:26.850
Max.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.243
Hey! Hey.

19:36.244 --> 19:39.240
What's that smell? I'm making cupcakes.

19:39.241 --> 19:43.404
- You lit the pilot light?
- Didn't have to. Look.

19:45.636 --> 19:48.800
No way! The Bluestar in purple?

19:48.801 --> 19:50.099
What the... how did it get...

19:50.100 --> 19:51.998
How can... how could you afford that?

19:51.999 --> 19:54.030
You sold your tat? Sold them all.

19:54.031 --> 19:57.060
Spent it on the oven, next-day
delivery fee and installation.

19:57.061 --> 19:58.659
That woman gave you a better price?

19:58.660 --> 20:00.890
No, she pulled a gun on me.

20:00.891 --> 20:02.423
So I went to every gold
store in Brooklyn,

20:02.424 --> 20:04.122
leveraged their offers
against each other

20:04.123 --> 20:06.087
until I got enough to buy the Bluestar.

20:06.088 --> 20:08.186
You didn't have to do that.

20:08.187 --> 20:10.850
After what I did, there
were no more words.

20:10.851 --> 20:12.315
Only ovens.

20:12.316 --> 20:15.047
And our future means more to
me than rings from my past.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.511
I told you, I'm in this
for the long haul.

20:18.512 --> 20:22.574
For the record, I hated
lunch with those girls.

20:22.575 --> 20:26.238
I'd rather split a Kit Kat in
a bathroom with you any day.

20:26.239 --> 20:27.870
I'm sorry I wasn't listening.

20:27.871 --> 20:30.702
I was staring at my new
boyfriend over there.

20:30.703 --> 20:33.499
I wanna make out with it!

20:34.733 --> 20:36.497
Ooh. Ow! Hot!

20:37.898 --> 20:39.828
There's not a ding!

20:39.829 --> 20:43.792
There's a ding. My rings bought a ding.

20:43.793 --> 20:45.891
You wanna hug me, don't you?

20:45.892 --> 20:48.122
Yeah.

20:48.123 --> 20:50.820
- But you're not gonna.
- Yes, I am.

20:50.821 --> 20:55.350
If you unzip my shirt,
I'm gonna be pissed!

20:55.351 --> 20:57.748
Impressed, but pissed.
