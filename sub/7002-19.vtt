00:02.568 --> 00:04.836
Tool time!
That's right.

00:04.837 --> 00:06.871
Binford tools
is proud to present

00:06.872 --> 00:09.741
Tim "the tool man" taylor!

00:09.742 --> 00:13.044
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

00:14.614 --> 00:15.614
Thank you.

00:15.615 --> 00:19.484
Thank you.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

00:19.485 --> 00:21.653
I'm your host
tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:21.654 --> 00:24.723
'course,
you all know my assistant
al "I live for bingo" borland.

00:27.426 --> 00:29.293
Here on <i>tool time</i>

00:29.294 --> 00:31.796
We've showed you
many different ways
to cut wood,

00:31.797 --> 00:33.798
But nothing as fun as today.

00:33.799 --> 00:36.635
Al, if we were gonna cut
that piece of pine,
what would you select?

00:36.636 --> 00:40.304
Well, tim, I'd probably use
the binford 2200 circular saw.

00:40.305 --> 00:43.274
Mm, good choice.
Ooh, but what if
we'd blown a fuse?

00:43.275 --> 00:45.877
I see we're at your house.

00:45.878 --> 00:48.146
Well, then I'd use
my trusty crosscut saw.

00:48.147 --> 00:50.148
That's a good choice,
but not today.

00:50.149 --> 00:52.150
Today we have
something special for you,

00:52.151 --> 00:54.619
And for that,
we have to bring out
a very special guest.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.788
And I expect a big
<i>tool time</i> round of applause

00:56.789 --> 01:00.491
For robert
"the human hatchet" cho!

01:00.492 --> 01:02.761
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

01:06.732 --> 01:09.433
If you were to cut
that piece of pine,

01:09.434 --> 01:11.469
Would you want to use
a circular saw for that?

01:11.470 --> 01:13.437
Won't be necessary, tim.
Hacksaw?

01:13.438 --> 01:15.406
No, no.
Coping saw?

01:15.407 --> 01:17.341
<i>(yelling)</i>

01:23.315 --> 01:24.916
Whoo.

01:24.917 --> 01:27.518
Here's a man who doesn't worry
about losing his house keys.

01:27.519 --> 01:29.754
Ha! I'm in!

01:29.755 --> 01:32.157
Mr. Cho is here to publicize
the karate demonstration

01:32.158 --> 01:34.159
This Tuesday night
at the fox theater

01:34.160 --> 01:36.061
To benefit
the children's hospital.

01:36.062 --> 01:38.763
That's right. Karate.
Boy, there's a sport
with more power.

01:38.764 --> 01:42.000
Ar-ar. Oh-ho-ho-ho.

01:42.001 --> 01:45.103
That's right, tim,
but the secret is
to channel that power

01:45.104 --> 01:47.105
Through focus
and concentration.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.107
Yeah. Two things
I excel at.

01:49.108 --> 01:52.844
Well, that and driving yourself
to the hospital while bleeding.

01:57.850 --> 02:00.551
Are you saying I couldn't
break that board
with my head?

02:00.552 --> 02:05.023
Well, tim, he says it takes
focus and concentration,

02:05.024 --> 02:08.592
And I think we all know
which one of us has that.

02:12.564 --> 02:15.366
You think you can
break this board
with your head?

02:15.367 --> 02:17.202
Yes, I do.
Oh, really?

02:17.203 --> 02:21.672
I don't think it's such
a good idea, al. I...
My show here, ok?

02:21.673 --> 02:24.242
You're up to the challenge,
right, al?

02:24.243 --> 02:25.676
It's all right.

02:28.814 --> 02:30.348
<i>(inhales deeply)</i>

02:35.320 --> 02:36.320
<i>(yells)</i>

02:36.321 --> 02:39.190
<i>(loud cheering)</i>

02:44.230 --> 02:46.231
Uh, tim. Tim.

02:46.232 --> 02:48.633
I don't think
you should try this.
Hey, quiet.

02:48.634 --> 02:50.802
There's one thing
you should...
You've said enough.

02:50.803 --> 02:53.838
You should know...
It's my show.
I can do this.

02:53.839 --> 02:56.074
<i>(inhales deeply)</i>

02:56.075 --> 02:59.177
<i>(hisses)</i>

03:01.113 --> 03:03.047
<i>(yells pseudo-japanese)</i>

03:06.852 --> 03:10.621
I was gonna say
I have studied karate, tim.

03:10.622 --> 03:13.491
Buford tools -
messages. We have 'em.

03:13.492 --> 03:15.626
We'll be right back.

04:26.332 --> 04:29.234
Well, what do you think?
Could we put the kids
in the middle?

04:31.636 --> 04:34.906
Spaghetti sauce
smells terrific.
Thank you.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.242
Honey, um,
this breadstick is too long

04:37.243 --> 04:38.910
For the bread basket.

04:38.911 --> 04:40.979
Could you break that
with your head?

04:44.383 --> 04:46.817
I think I can handle that.
Focus.

04:46.818 --> 04:49.254
I can handle it.
I can handle it.

04:49.255 --> 04:51.789
<i>(mumbles</i>
<i>in pseudo-japanese)</i>

04:51.790 --> 04:54.658
Hyah!
Ah.

04:57.429 --> 04:59.530
Hey, dad. Think fast.

04:59.531 --> 05:01.565
Not in the house!

05:02.868 --> 05:05.069
You guys are jerks.
Aw, go play in quicksand.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.404
Oh, shut up.

05:06.405 --> 05:09.040
Stop it. Come over here.
What's going on?

05:09.041 --> 05:11.409
They won't let me
play football
with them.

05:11.410 --> 05:14.078
Still?
Guys, how many times
do we have to tell you?

05:14.079 --> 05:15.846
Let your brother play.

05:15.847 --> 05:18.549
We were just about
to put him in the game
when everyone had to go home.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.684
Yeah, that's right.
You guys are lying.

05:20.685 --> 05:25.189
Hey, hey, let me handle this.
You guys are lying.

05:25.190 --> 05:26.891
Yeah.

05:26.892 --> 05:29.627
Mark, get out of here
for a minute.
We'll talk to them.

05:29.628 --> 05:32.196
Stop doing that stuff.
What's the matter
with you guys?

05:32.197 --> 05:34.098
Dad, he's a huge geek.

05:34.099 --> 05:35.599
That is enough.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.303
Now listen, the next time
he wants to play, include him.

05:38.304 --> 05:42.240
Dad, he's always running
out of bounds. He's chicken.

05:42.241 --> 05:45.109
He's not chicken.
He just doesn't have
a lot of self-confidence.

05:45.110 --> 05:46.911
He's afraid
of getting hit.

05:46.912 --> 05:49.747
Just tell the other guys
that he has some kind
of horrible rash

05:49.748 --> 05:51.582
And they shouldn't
touch him.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.351
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.353
Why don't you teach him
something about football?

05:55.354 --> 05:58.356
Like right now,
I'll teach you guys
how to go a long pass.

05:58.357 --> 06:01.359
Go long, come on.
In there. Swerve now.
Long! Go! Come on!

06:01.360 --> 06:03.561
Longer! Go long!

06:03.562 --> 06:05.663
Post pattern. Go! Go!

06:05.664 --> 06:07.966
<i>(brad)</i> dad, come on!
I'm in the bathroom!

06:07.967 --> 06:10.734
Well, shut the door
and take a shower.

06:13.105 --> 06:15.106
I think you're right
about mark.

06:15.107 --> 06:17.208
I think that he just has
a self-confidence problem.

06:17.209 --> 06:19.043
We should find him something
that he can be good at.

06:19.044 --> 06:21.980
I got it. I got it.
How about...

06:21.981 --> 06:24.082
<i>(mumbles in pseudo-japanese)</i>

06:24.083 --> 06:26.017
Flight attendant?

06:26.018 --> 06:28.286
Karate.

06:28.287 --> 06:30.355
No, no.
Karate is too violent.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.223
What about gymnastics?

06:32.224 --> 06:34.592
That's a wonderful sport,
and he won't get hurt.

06:34.593 --> 06:36.194
He won't get hurt?

06:36.195 --> 06:39.097
One slip
on the pommel horse - boom.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.932
Why don't we just
let mark decide?
There's an idea.

06:41.933 --> 06:44.435
Hey, mark,
come down here!
<i>(mark)</i> coming!

06:44.436 --> 06:46.871
I'll just ask him
which he prefers,
gymnastics or karate.

06:46.872 --> 06:48.839
I'll ask him.
No, no, no. I know you.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.841
You'll just try
to influence him.

06:50.842 --> 06:52.843
I am gonna be fair
and objective.
No tricks.

06:52.844 --> 06:55.446
I won't say a word.
Ok, mark. Sit down.

06:55.447 --> 06:58.349
Your father and I
were just talking
and, uh...

07:01.487 --> 07:04.555
We think that since
brad and randy won't ever
let you play with them,

07:04.556 --> 07:07.558
You should take some class
where everyone gets to
participate.

07:07.559 --> 07:09.260
So, what do you think?

07:09.261 --> 07:14.865
You wanna take gymnastics
or... Karate?

07:14.866 --> 07:17.768
I can take karate?

07:17.769 --> 07:18.836
All right.

07:18.837 --> 07:22.473
Before you decide...
Before you decide...

07:22.474 --> 07:24.975
Do you remember
when we watched the olympics

07:24.976 --> 07:27.478
And we saw those
handsome american gymnasts

07:27.479 --> 07:30.981
Get their gold medals?

07:30.982 --> 07:32.050
Jill...

07:32.051 --> 07:33.651
Shut up.

07:33.652 --> 07:37.288
They were standing, remember,
on that podium, so proud,

07:37.289 --> 07:39.657
And the american flag
was raised

07:39.658 --> 07:42.860
And "the star-spangled banner"
was playing,

07:42.861 --> 07:45.163
And america wept.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.931
Please!
Remember that?

07:46.932 --> 07:49.133
That could be you.
That could be <i>you.</i>

07:49.134 --> 07:50.901
Mark taylor, gymnast,

07:50.902 --> 07:53.271
Representing the entire
United States of america.

07:53.272 --> 07:56.441
When does he get his
congressional medal of honor?

07:56.442 --> 07:58.443
Or you could take karate

07:58.444 --> 08:00.545
And, you know,
probably lose some teeth.

08:00.546 --> 08:02.880
Or slip on a pommel horse
and squish your little...

08:02.881 --> 08:06.784
Tim... Don't try
to influence him.

08:06.785 --> 08:08.819
I've just got one thing
to say to you.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.721
<i>(yells in pseudo-japanese)</i>

08:10.722 --> 08:13.491
...Tanaka mothra!

08:13.492 --> 08:15.359
Karate!
All right.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.660
Yes!

08:16.661 --> 08:19.029
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

08:20.999 --> 08:23.167
Ok, everyone stand up.
"yes, sensei."
<i>(all)</i> yes, sensei.

08:23.168 --> 08:24.335
Push back.

08:24.336 --> 08:26.337
I'm gonna show you
a little piece

08:26.338 --> 08:28.839
Of the demonstration
I'm gonna do this weekend.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.352
<i>(cho yelling)</i>

08:46.492 --> 08:48.025
Tim?
Yeah?

08:48.026 --> 08:51.629
Having a muscle spasm?
No, I was working
some karate moves.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.964
Oh, is that
what that was?

08:53.965 --> 08:56.000
You ok?

08:56.001 --> 08:57.235
Ok, class.

08:57.236 --> 08:58.736
Line up.
Yes, sensei!

08:58.737 --> 09:00.404
Yes, sensei.

09:00.405 --> 09:02.540
Horse stance, one.
Hands out.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.942
<i>(jill)</i> hi.

09:04.943 --> 09:06.210
Hi, mark.

09:06.211 --> 09:08.045
Kids don't wave
at their moms

09:08.046 --> 09:09.347
During karate class.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.282
Fighting stance.
Ready? Loud.

09:11.283 --> 09:13.984
Ich, ni, san, hyah!

09:13.985 --> 09:17.221
Look at that. He's got
his fists clenched so tight

09:17.222 --> 09:19.323
His little knuckles
are turning white.

09:19.324 --> 09:21.325
Couldn't he...
Loosen that up some?

09:21.326 --> 09:23.661
Oh, yeah, loose fist makes
a very effective weapon.

09:23.662 --> 09:26.164
That's how come boxers
always come together
with the referee.

09:26.165 --> 09:28.166
"all right, guys.
Come out slapping."

09:28.167 --> 09:30.668
"take that,
you big mean man.
Take that, take that."

09:30.669 --> 09:33.137
Stop it.

09:33.138 --> 09:36.040
He does look real cute
doing this.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.875
Well, I don't know.

09:37.876 --> 09:40.378
Maybe karate's
not so bad after all.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.213
It seems pretty harmless.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.415
I really should get home
and start dinner.

09:44.416 --> 09:46.417
I'll see you later.
See you later.

09:46.418 --> 09:48.553
Now we're gonna do
some free fighting.
Push back.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.224
Free fighting?
What is that?
It's just a term.

09:53.225 --> 09:56.494
So is "cracked fibula."

09:56.495 --> 09:59.597
I've asked two boys
from my advanced class
to do a demonstration for you.

09:59.598 --> 10:02.233
Face each other. Bow.
Fighting stance.

10:02.234 --> 10:03.867
<i>(boys yelling)</i>

10:05.337 --> 10:07.405
<i>(cho)</i> 2, 3.

10:09.941 --> 10:12.710
This is what you have
to look forward to.

10:12.711 --> 10:16.146
I don't think so.
It's pommel horse time.

10:16.147 --> 10:19.317
Come on, sit down.
These are the experienced -
advanced class.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.819
Mark won't be able
to kill anybody
till he's 10 or 11.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.387
Oh, that's comforting.

10:23.388 --> 10:26.790
Everyone, stand up.
Get a partner, quick.

10:26.791 --> 10:29.193
Grab a partner.
Let's go. Let's go.

10:29.194 --> 10:31.429
You two, up front.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.930
Hey, this isn't fair.

10:32.931 --> 10:35.132
That kid's way bigger
than mark.
Shh.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.968
All right, artie.
Get ready to kick
some butt, huh?

10:42.641 --> 10:45.476
Boy, there's a mom
you could love, huh?

10:45.477 --> 10:47.745
Yeah, that butt
she wants kicked is mark's.

10:47.746 --> 10:49.847
It's just an exercise.
Mark, go on. Come on, buddy.

10:49.848 --> 10:53.951
1, 2! That's it, see?
Keep your hands up.

10:53.952 --> 10:57.355
Did you see that?
That kid slapped him
when the teacher wasn't looking.

10:57.356 --> 10:59.690
Mark, let it go, buddy.
Let it go. Focus, come on.

10:59.691 --> 11:03.160
<i>(cho)</i> high block,
knife hand. 1, 2!
Artie, grind him up, huh?

11:05.130 --> 11:06.897
Excuse me.

11:06.898 --> 11:09.900
Ma'am, um, I don't think
you should be encouraging
your child

11:09.901 --> 11:11.535
In this sort of behavior.

11:11.536 --> 11:14.104
What are you
talking about?
He just slapped my boy.

11:14.105 --> 11:17.308
It's karate class.
That's what it's all about.

11:17.309 --> 11:20.344
No. Slapping is not
what it is all about.

11:20.345 --> 11:22.580
Hey, if stick boy
can't take it,

11:22.581 --> 11:25.883
Get him out of here.
He did it again!

11:25.884 --> 11:28.252
Come on, tell your kid
to stop playing dirty.

11:28.253 --> 11:29.887
Listen, they are
just having fun.

11:29.888 --> 11:31.522
Artie's not gonna
hurt stick boy.

11:31.523 --> 11:34.692
Would you stop calling my kid
"stick boy"?

11:34.693 --> 11:36.494
Then feed him something.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.329
Face it, lady.
Your kid's a weenie.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.331
Artie just gave him
a little tap.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.833
How would you like it
if somebody gave you
a little tap?

11:42.834 --> 11:44.835
Is that fun?

11:47.005 --> 11:48.906
Don't touch me, lady.

11:48.907 --> 11:51.442
Hey, don't shove me.
Get outta my face.

11:51.443 --> 11:52.943
Why don't you tell that
to your breakfast doughnut?

11:52.944 --> 11:54.978
Hey, hey, honey.
Stop it!

11:54.979 --> 11:57.147
Hyah!

11:57.148 --> 11:58.783
You ok, dad?

11:58.784 --> 12:00.451
Yeah.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.395
Let me go tell
brad and randy
what happened.

12:11.396 --> 12:13.464
No, don't.

12:13.465 --> 12:15.966
Brad, randy!
I can't believe it.

12:15.967 --> 12:19.470
I am so ashamed
that I got into a fight
with that woman.

12:19.471 --> 12:21.505
You were just trying
to protect our son.

12:21.506 --> 12:23.507
Well, it was the
karate class.

12:23.508 --> 12:25.509
How can you not be violent

12:25.510 --> 12:29.279
When everybody around you
is going, "hey-ha, ho, ya-ya"?

12:29.280 --> 12:33.183
Hey, dad. I heard a woman
slugged you with her purse?

12:33.184 --> 12:36.620
What happened, she wouldn't
let you borrow her makeup?

12:37.989 --> 12:40.624
Son, you want to say that
one more time to me?

12:40.625 --> 12:43.794
No.

12:43.795 --> 12:46.063
Quit teasing your dad.
It's my fault.

12:46.064 --> 12:48.098
I got into a fight
with this woman.

12:48.099 --> 12:49.933
Oh, mom, that's great!

12:49.934 --> 12:52.536
No, it is not great.

12:52.537 --> 12:55.138
So, dad, how'd she do?
She was awesome.

12:55.139 --> 12:57.808
She stepped right in there,
face to face, toe to toe.
It was great.

12:57.809 --> 13:00.811
It was stupid,
and it never would have happened

13:00.812 --> 13:04.047
If that woman had
just stopped her son
from hitting mark.

13:04.048 --> 13:07.084
Ooh, little mark needs mommy
to fight his battles.

13:07.085 --> 13:08.719
Shut up!

13:08.720 --> 13:10.855
<i>(tim)</i> cut it out.
Stop it.
Guys, stop it!

13:10.856 --> 13:13.924
Stop that! Come here!
Hey, when I tell you
to stop, stop.

13:13.925 --> 13:15.959
You better watch out.
Another week of karate,

13:15.960 --> 13:18.061
He'll be able to
wipe the floor with you.

13:18.062 --> 13:19.563
Yeah, right.
Look at him.

13:19.564 --> 13:22.366
No! Why are you all
so fascinated with fighting?

13:22.367 --> 13:25.603
I don't want anybody
to beat anybody up.

13:25.604 --> 13:28.773
What is wrong with you people?
You make me sick.

13:28.774 --> 13:32.777
I just want you
to love each other,
you big bunch of jerks!

13:39.317 --> 13:42.252
Are you satisfied?
I mean, she's talking
to you two.

13:45.957 --> 13:47.458
You bummed her out.

13:47.459 --> 13:49.627
All she wants is us
to show a little respect
to one another.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.194
Is that too much to ask?

13:51.195 --> 13:53.230
Dad, we're sorry.

13:53.231 --> 13:55.699
Yeah, we'll try.

13:56.968 --> 13:58.969
<i>(both)</i> dad got hit by a girl!

13:58.970 --> 14:02.406
Dad got hit by a girl!

14:02.407 --> 14:04.942
I know where you both live!

14:06.678 --> 14:08.512
And that's the proper way

14:08.513 --> 14:10.514
To repair a mortise
and tenon joint.

14:10.515 --> 14:12.182
Good job, al.
Thank you, tim.

14:12.183 --> 14:15.185
If we were building a coffin,
would we have to build

14:15.186 --> 14:17.254
A rigor mortis
and tenon joint?

14:20.525 --> 14:22.660
I don't think so, tim.

14:22.661 --> 14:24.662
Almost out of time, al.

14:24.663 --> 14:27.698
Just enough time
for "camouflage corner."

14:27.699 --> 14:29.366
"camouflage corner"?

14:29.367 --> 14:32.402
Yeah. Didn't you get
that memo?
No.

14:32.403 --> 14:34.772
Must have been camouflaged.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.476
Normally
when we think of camouflage,

14:38.477 --> 14:39.977
We think of military.

14:39.978 --> 14:41.979
Now this is your
typical military soldier's

14:41.980 --> 14:43.781
Tiger camouflage.

14:45.617 --> 14:49.019
Now here's that same soldier
in a costa rican jungle.

14:51.456 --> 14:53.457
Where is he?
I can't even see him!

14:53.458 --> 14:57.394
He could be looking at me
right now! I'm so scared!

14:57.395 --> 14:59.797
Al, there's also applications
in your yard.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.331
That tool shed of yours?

15:01.332 --> 15:03.333
A little unsightly
out there in the backyard?

15:03.334 --> 15:04.735
All right.

15:04.736 --> 15:06.737
Now, here's a way
to camouflage.

15:06.738 --> 15:08.739
You can hardly even tell
it's there now.

15:12.644 --> 15:15.679
Think you've finally
lost it, tim.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.247
I'm just joking around, al.

15:17.248 --> 15:19.884
Actually, camouflage
has many applications,
even around the house.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.719
Lisa, bring that out, please.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.053
Let's take wallpaper.

15:23.054 --> 15:25.055
Wallpaper can be used
to decorate a wall

15:25.056 --> 15:27.290
Or disguise
an unsightly wall switch.

15:27.291 --> 15:30.360
Now, you see, can you find
the wall switch here, al?

15:35.834 --> 15:37.835
Well, they're usually...

15:37.836 --> 15:39.837
They're usually
right along the...

15:39.838 --> 15:42.239
Not as easy
as it looks, is it, al?

15:42.240 --> 15:44.708
That's camouflage for you.
Whoop!

15:49.748 --> 15:52.883
This is ridiculous, tim.
I don't want to be a part
of this anymore.

15:52.884 --> 15:56.253
I'm sorry, al.
Just trying to make a point.

15:56.254 --> 15:58.689
Here, put these away for me,
will you?
Come on. Put 'em...

15:58.690 --> 16:01.725
Just grab them, al.
Grab the darn things, al.

16:01.726 --> 16:05.896
Al? Hey, al, where'd you go?

16:08.900 --> 16:11.201
<i>(tim)</i> al!

16:13.104 --> 16:15.206
Al!

16:15.207 --> 16:17.708
All right,
one more time. Ready?
Fighting position.

16:17.709 --> 16:20.711
<i>(both)</i> ich, ni, san, hyah!

16:20.712 --> 16:23.013
Again, again, again.
Fighting position.

16:23.014 --> 16:25.683
<i>(both)</i> ich, ni, san, hyah!

16:25.684 --> 16:27.350
That's good.
Let's do it again.

16:27.351 --> 16:29.519
No, I don't want to
wear you out before class.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.089
I'm not tired.
Oh, you're tired.
I know when you're tired.

16:32.090 --> 16:34.124
I can tell
just by looking at you.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.960
Hi-ho, neighbor.
Hi, wilson. How are you?

16:35.961 --> 16:37.728
You all right there?
I'm great.

16:37.729 --> 16:39.730
I got him in a karate class.

16:39.731 --> 16:41.732
We're out here
to practice some moves.

16:41.733 --> 16:43.734
Karate does build up
the stamina.
Yeah.

16:43.735 --> 16:45.736
Jill thinks I have him
taking the karate class

16:45.737 --> 16:47.738
So it'll teach him
how to fight.

16:47.739 --> 16:50.641
Oh, so jill thinks
you have a predilection
for aggression.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.576
Predilection?
Let's just say
proclivity.

16:52.577 --> 16:55.312
Proclivity?
What else you got?

16:55.313 --> 16:57.081
How about inclination?

16:57.082 --> 16:59.416
Inclination, yeah.
Well, that's what
she thinks, anyway.

16:59.417 --> 17:01.585
But you're not actually
encouraging mark to fight.

17:01.586 --> 17:04.054
No. I just want him to be able
to stand up for himself.

17:04.055 --> 17:07.057
If he gets in a bad situation,
I'd like him to be able
to kick butt in a major way.

17:07.058 --> 17:08.791
But every dad wants that.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.594
Gandhi's dad didn't.

17:10.595 --> 17:13.797
Well, maybe gandhi was
a major disappointment
to his dad.

17:13.798 --> 17:16.967
Maybe gandhi didn't eat
because he wouldn't fight kids
for his lunch money.

17:16.968 --> 17:18.468
How about that?

17:18.469 --> 17:21.771
Well, now, tim, are we talking
about the same gandhi?

17:21.772 --> 17:25.108
Not unless he went
to my elementary school.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.611
You see, when I was that age,

17:27.612 --> 17:31.381
If I couldn't wisecrack
my way out of a situation,
sometimes I'd run,

17:31.382 --> 17:34.317
And I'm thinking that karate

17:34.318 --> 17:37.688
Would give mark, you know,
the ability to stand up
for himself.

17:37.689 --> 17:41.291
Well, tim, I'm reminded of
what the greek historian
herodotus said -

17:41.292 --> 17:44.928
"where wisdom is called for,
force is of little use."

17:44.929 --> 17:46.997
Of course wisdom
is the best way to go,

17:46.998 --> 17:49.432
But when a fat kid
is slapping you around,

17:49.433 --> 17:51.535
You don't have time
to be thinking about

17:51.536 --> 17:54.471
Reciting the state capitals
alphabetically.

17:54.472 --> 17:56.406
Well, that's interesting.

17:56.407 --> 17:59.276
Albany, annapolis,
atlanta...

17:59.277 --> 18:01.478
Wilson.
Augusta, austin...

18:01.479 --> 18:02.579
Wilson!
Baton rouge...

18:02.580 --> 18:05.049
You got a minute?
Oh, I'm sorry, neighbor.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.350
Do you think it's a bad idea
to teach the kid karate?

18:07.351 --> 18:11.321
You just have to remember
that when you give a boy
a weapon like karate

18:11.322 --> 18:14.324
That he's mature enough
to know when to use it.

18:14.325 --> 18:18.062
Yeah, he is
a little kid, isn't he?
Mm-hmm.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.462
Have a good day.
Mm-hmm.

18:19.463 --> 18:24.001
Bismarck, boise,
boston, carson city...

18:24.002 --> 18:25.002
Charleston!

18:25.003 --> 18:26.737
Cheyenne, columbia...

18:30.075 --> 18:32.576
Dad, is mom coming?
No.

18:32.577 --> 18:35.579
What are we gonna do
in case there's trouble?

18:39.417 --> 18:42.820
There's not gonna be
any trouble.
Bow.

18:42.821 --> 18:46.123
If artie pushes me,
I'm gonna give him
a karate chop.

18:46.124 --> 18:48.625
You're not ready
to karate chop anybody yet.

18:48.626 --> 18:50.627
You don't know enough
about karate.

18:50.628 --> 18:52.996
But you're learning.
You're gonna know pretty soon.

18:52.997 --> 18:55.199
Then I'll beat him up,
I guess.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.367
No, no, no, no, no.
With guys like artie,

18:57.368 --> 18:59.536
Once they know
that you have the skill

18:59.537 --> 19:01.705
To actually beat them up,
you don't have to.

19:01.706 --> 19:03.941
Then you have the confidence
to just stand there,

19:03.942 --> 19:06.443
And <i>they</i> walk away,
you know?

19:06.444 --> 19:08.779
Karate does give you
more power,

19:08.780 --> 19:12.182
But it's wisdom that teaches you
when to use the power.

19:12.183 --> 19:15.953
That's according to
greek historian hippopotamus.

19:15.954 --> 19:20.958
What are we gonna do
in case he pushes me today?

19:20.959 --> 19:22.860
Just wave those socks
in front of him.

19:22.861 --> 19:24.294
Boy.
Dad, come on.

19:24.295 --> 19:26.930
You got a fish in there?
Dad.

19:26.931 --> 19:29.099
Recite the state capitals.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.500
I don't know them.

19:30.501 --> 19:33.503
Then walk away from it, ok?
Ok.

19:33.504 --> 19:36.840
Have fun. That's the key here.
Fun. Concentrate.
Have a good time.

19:36.841 --> 19:38.541
Hi.
How you doing?

19:38.542 --> 19:40.343
Boy, these kids
love this, don't they?
Yeah.

19:40.344 --> 19:42.679
I could have used
a class like this
when I was a kid.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.182
You and me both.
Who are you with?
Artie.

19:46.985 --> 19:49.219
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:55.459 --> 19:58.495
I don't want butterball
to mess with my kid today, ok?

19:58.496 --> 20:00.864
Well, you don't have to be
so mean about it.

20:00.865 --> 20:04.367
Look, I'm just saying
I don't want artie
touching my kid.

20:04.368 --> 20:06.469
And if anybody
calls my kid "stick boy,"

20:06.470 --> 20:08.471
There's gonna be
some big trouble.

20:08.472 --> 20:10.473
If you've got a problem
with my nephew,

20:10.474 --> 20:13.376
Maybe you'd better talk
to his father.
His father?

20:13.377 --> 20:15.212
Hey, roy!

20:16.915 --> 20:18.916
That's his father?
Yeah.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.717
Why aren't <i>you</i>
his father?

20:21.853 --> 20:23.687
Hey, mike. What's up?

20:23.688 --> 20:25.689
This guy here...
What's your name?

20:25.690 --> 20:29.092
Borland. Al borland.

20:29.093 --> 20:31.094
Al said if artie
touches stick boy,

20:31.095 --> 20:33.130
There's going to be
big trouble.

20:33.131 --> 20:36.934
Did I say it like that,
with hostility like that?
It didn't come out...

20:36.935 --> 20:39.970
Wait a minute.
My wife told me about you.

20:39.971 --> 20:42.005
You're married
to that loudmouth.

20:42.006 --> 20:44.875
Yeah, that's her.

20:46.444 --> 20:48.946
I don't like anyone
threatening my son.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.447
Don't crowd me.

20:50.448 --> 20:52.716
What are you gonna do
about it?

20:52.717 --> 20:56.720
Atlanta, austin...

20:56.721 --> 20:59.056
Afghanistan...

20:59.057 --> 21:00.757
So you're a wise guy, huh?
Hey, hey, hey.

21:00.758 --> 21:03.093
Hey, leave my father alone.
Mark, I can handle this.
Mark!

21:03.094 --> 21:06.196
Ich, ni, san, hyah!
Mark, come on. Mark.

21:06.197 --> 21:08.932
Back off, stick boy.
Hey, don't push my kid
like that.

21:08.933 --> 21:10.868
Like you're gonna stop me.
Yeah.

21:14.939 --> 21:16.806
Hold on a minute!
Hold on a minute!

21:16.807 --> 21:19.642
See, mark?
I should have walked away.

21:21.512 --> 21:23.113
That was your best shot?

21:23.114 --> 21:25.115
<i>(gasps)</i> better. Better.

21:25.116 --> 21:26.716
Good. Good.
<i>(rings)</i>

21:28.319 --> 21:32.055
No. No, I understand,
mr. Cho. It's fine.

21:32.056 --> 21:33.757
Ok. Bye-bye.

21:33.758 --> 21:35.759
I'm taking mark
to karate class.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.761
No, you're not.
That was mr. Cho.

21:37.762 --> 21:40.130
He's moving mark
into a different class.

21:40.131 --> 21:42.132
All right.
Advanced class, huh?

21:42.133 --> 21:46.503
That was all those extra lessons
I've been doing with him. Ha!

21:46.504 --> 21:48.005
No, tim.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.507
Mr. Cho is not

There's another
beginners' class
that starts in two weeks.

21:53.511 --> 21:55.345
He's gonna put him
in that.
Why?

21:55.346 --> 21:57.347
He says that
we don't understand

21:57.348 --> 22:00.050
The basic philosophy
behind karate.
What?

22:00.051 --> 22:03.420
Yeah. He thinks that we have
a lot of... Pent-up hostility.

22:03.421 --> 22:06.423
That's crazy. I'm gonna get
that idiot on the phone.

22:06.424 --> 22:08.258
He has a point, you know.

22:08.259 --> 22:10.928
Every time
we took mark to class,
one of us hit somebody.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.763
Well, you started it,
though.

22:13.764 --> 22:18.435
I got a way that we can...
Let off some steam.

22:18.436 --> 22:20.003
Ohh, ohh.

22:20.004 --> 22:23.006
It'll put us in great shape
for mark's next karate class.

Yeah?
Yeah.

22:24.642 --> 22:26.343
