00:03.700 --> 00:06.000
My name is Melinda Gordon.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.300
I'm married,

00:07.400 --> 00:09.400
I live in a small town,

00:09.500 --> 00:11.500
and I own an antique shop.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.600
I might be just like you.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.400
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:15.500 --> 00:17.900
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.100
It's all right, honey.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.300
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:22.408 --> 00:25.000
They're stuck here, because they have
unfinished business with the living,

00:25.104 --> 00:28.801
and they come to me for help.

00:30.303 --> 00:35.708
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:52.001 --> 00:53.609
Come on. Come on.

00:53.709 --> 00:55.401
We can win this.

00:55.505 --> 00:56.601
Now. Downcourt.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.700
Bring it. Come on.

00:57.805 --> 00:59.302
Come on. Shoot!

00:59.406 --> 01:02.401
Shoot, you idiot!

01:02.708 --> 01:06.300
Oh. Get it!
Get it! Get it!

01:06.907 --> 01:09.002
What?

01:09.108 --> 01:10.900
Son of a...

01:11.007 --> 01:14.401
un-friggin'-believable.

01:22.106 --> 01:25.200
Someone down here?

02:00.305 --> 02:01.802
Did you get a look at his face?

02:01.907 --> 02:05.003
Dude, I almost peed myself.

02:05.106 --> 02:08.300
What a geek.
He actually thought I was a ghost.

02:08.405 --> 02:09.502
I'm bad.

02:09.607 --> 02:12.803
Teach him to chew us out for a little game of handball.

02:12.908 --> 02:16.603
Better grab that firecracker.

02:17.305 --> 02:20.902
Cool. All right. Let's go.

02:24.508 --> 02:28.400
- Whoa. What'd you do?
- Nothin'. I didn't do anything.

02:28.505 --> 02:31.503
What's happening?

02:34.108 --> 02:35.303
Who's doing that?

02:35.407 --> 02:39.601
I don't know.
Let's get out of here!

02:43.605 --> 02:46.403
So, what about Tim?
Is he history?

02:46.506 --> 02:47.600
No.

02:47.708 --> 02:50.901
In fact, we finally went on
our first real date.

02:51.008 --> 02:52.403
It was really nice.

02:52.507 --> 02:54.003
But I gotta tell you,

02:54.108 --> 02:59.003
he burned me once, so a girl's
gotta cover her bases.

02:59.108 --> 03:00.901
That's so weird. I just...

03:01.005 --> 03:03.301
had the other shoe in my hand.

03:03.408 --> 03:04.703
Oh! Here it is.

03:04.807 --> 03:06.602
So who's the guy tonight?

03:06.708 --> 03:07.802
Dale.

03:07.907 --> 03:11.300
He's a loan broker, boring, I know,
but he is so nice.

03:11.406 --> 03:14.900
He used to ask me out when I worked
at the real estate office, and...

03:15.007 --> 03:17.803
you know, when I finally decided
that I was ready to date,

03:17.907 --> 03:21.602
I called him, and you know...

03:23.305 --> 03:25.503
Oh, great.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.300
These are brand-new.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.503
I can't believe it.

03:28.606 --> 03:31.400
Well, just for the record, I agree
that Tim deserves a little payback.

03:31.508 --> 03:33.700
Oh, wow. Fright night.
I forgot.

03:33.807 --> 03:35.603
Correction.
Retro fright night.

03:35.707 --> 03:38.200
Psycho, Hell House,
I Know What You Did Last Summer.

03:38.307 --> 03:39.803
Wait. How is that retro?

03:39.907 --> 03:42.503
Which one?

03:42.606 --> 03:44.401
Cool. So I'm gonna go chill a minute.

03:44.506 --> 03:46.202
Ok. Have a good time.

03:46.305 --> 03:48.401
Hey, I don't want you
staying up too late.

03:48.506 --> 03:51.700
And, Ned, be sure to listen
to Melinda tonight.

03:51.808 --> 03:54.802
Ned, we gotta get started.

03:54.906 --> 03:57.102
Ned.

04:04.508 --> 04:06.503
Who are you?

04:06.605 --> 04:09.601
What do you want?

04:12.908 --> 04:14.601
Stop it!

04:14.708 --> 04:16.903
Ned.

04:19.606 --> 04:22.903
It's come back for me.

04:48.906 --> 04:52.801
EPISODE 2x19
Delia's First Ghost

04:55.606 --> 04:58.900
What do you mean it's
come back for you? Who?

04:59.005 --> 05:01.101
I don't know. I...

05:01.208 --> 05:02.602
Me and my buddy Grant,

05:02.708 --> 05:03.903
just for kicks, you know,

05:04.008 --> 05:06.803
we rig things to explode and stuff
to scare people,

05:06.907 --> 05:08.803
mostly our old grumpy super.

05:08.908 --> 05:10.202
Ok, so he's after you?

05:10.307 --> 05:11.303
No.

05:11.407 --> 05:15.103
Today, there was something with
us down there, something weird.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.001
Scared the crap out of me and Grant.

05:17.107 --> 05:18.302
It was a ghost, right?

05:18.406 --> 05:19.901
Did you get a look at it?

05:20.005 --> 05:21.602
I don't think it wanted me to,

05:21.706 --> 05:23.502
but it did want me to find these.

05:23.608 --> 05:25.902
Wait. So this ghost is mad, right?

05:26.005 --> 05:28.203
Does anybody ever go like...

05:28.305 --> 05:29.802
Because in Claw 2,

05:29.906 --> 05:31.800
- when that guy got that...
- Ned,

05:31.906 --> 05:33.900
I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

05:34.007 --> 05:35.302
But that thing's dogging me.

05:35.408 --> 05:37.403
Yeah, and you're gonna have to
help me figure out why,

05:37.505 --> 05:39.901
ok, so we can get it to leave.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.502
Yeah. Ok.

05:43.405 --> 05:46.601
- You gonna tell my mom about those?
- No,

05:46.705 --> 05:51.302
but it's gonna be a very different
fright night than we had planned.

05:51.408 --> 05:53.803
So, after we agreed on a rate,

05:53.906 --> 05:56.300
I said, "if you can't bring me comps,

05:56.407 --> 05:58.103
you're not gettin' your cap back. "

05:58.206 --> 05:59.402
You really said that?

05:59.505 --> 06:01.700
Seriously, I said that.

06:01.805 --> 06:06.401
I was willing to blow a million-dollar
deal for a phillies cap.

06:06.508 --> 06:09.403
Very bold move.

06:10.206 --> 06:13.201
You have a little something right here.

06:13.305 --> 06:14.402
Oh, that is...

06:14.506 --> 06:16.200
not embarrassing at all.

06:16.306 --> 06:19.201
Happens to me all the time.

06:19.306 --> 06:21.400
I doubt that, but thank you.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.200
How am I?

06:23.306 --> 06:24.701
You're good.
You're very, very good.

06:24.807 --> 06:25.803
Thank you.

06:25.906 --> 06:29.503
Now, I would like to propose a toast...

06:29.605 --> 06:31.003
to you,

06:31.106 --> 06:35.300
to thank you for finally saying yes.

06:41.907 --> 06:43.501
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I just...

06:43.607 --> 06:46.602
- I just got a little singed.
- That was so strange.

06:46.705 --> 06:48.801
Are you ok?
I'm sorry I spilled...

06:48.905 --> 06:52.303
No, I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.

06:52.407 --> 06:54.400
Come on, clancy.
Man, don't be a buzzkill.

06:54.505 --> 06:56.500
When was the last time
we went out after work?

06:56.608 --> 06:58.501
Last thursday.

06:58.607 --> 07:00.000
Hey, is that...

07:00.106 --> 07:02.603
That's Delia.

07:02.705 --> 07:04.200
Is she on a date?

07:04.306 --> 07:08.000
Please don't tell me that's a date.

07:08.107 --> 07:08.600
It is.

07:08.706 --> 07:10.802
Man, I thought we were good.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.001
I apologized.
I went to great lengths.

07:13.106 --> 07:16.401
- That coffee stunt was sweet, Flaher.
- Right. She loved it.

07:16.508 --> 07:21.300
I took her out to dinner.
We had a great Time, so why is she...

07:21.408 --> 07:23.803
You knew...

07:23.905 --> 07:24.801
and you didn't tell me?

07:24.906 --> 07:28.003
Is it my job to tell you?
She can go out on a date.

07:28.106 --> 07:31.101
- You hurt her feelings, Flaherty.
- What are you, part girl now?

07:31.206 --> 07:32.600
Is that it? Ok.

07:32.705 --> 07:35.103
Ok. Fine. All right.
Game on. Here's the deal.

07:35.208 --> 07:36.800
I need an edge. All right?
You gotta ask Melinda

07:36.907 --> 07:38.600
what kind of stuff Delia likes.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.902
You don't need to jump
through hoops for Delia.

07:41.006 --> 07:42.601
- She likes you.
- Oh? Oh, yeah?

07:42.706 --> 07:46.903
Then why is she out with pretty boy?

07:49.506 --> 07:51.500
I nearly had a stroke when you called,

07:51.606 --> 07:54.902
but I get that you needed time.

07:55.006 --> 07:56.700
Yeah, lots of it, I guess.

07:56.904 --> 08:01.401
Waiting till you're ready
is a good thing. h

08:18.503 --> 08:20.708
How long we gotta be down here?

08:20.801 --> 08:23.909
Hey, that powder,
do you know what that is?

08:24.009 --> 08:25.601
Yeah. It's laundry soap.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.200
We set firecrackers
to explode the boxes...

08:28.307 --> 08:31.700
And that's when the room
started shaking?

08:31.806 --> 08:34.602
So he's after your fireworks.

08:34.706 --> 08:37.703
All right, here's the deal.
You have to apologize,

08:37.807 --> 08:40.500
and once maybe you make things right,

08:40.607 --> 08:43.201
hopefully I can get the spirit
to move on.

08:43.308 --> 08:46.600
Ok. So I'm sorry. I...

08:51.706 --> 08:54.701
Ok, that didn't happen before.

08:54.806 --> 08:56.100
Waste!

08:56.205 --> 08:58.902
All right. Ok, stop it.
He said he was sorry.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.403
- What's going on?!
- I don't know.

09:02.507 --> 09:06.102
Did I say something wrong?

09:07.105 --> 09:11.302
Ok, let's get out of here.
Let's go.

09:18.206 --> 09:20.400
Ned.

09:26.808 --> 09:29.701
Ok, don't go into the basement
until I can figure this out.

09:29.808 --> 09:31.201
Now, he said, "stay away,"

09:31.308 --> 09:33.503
so hopefully if you're not
bugging him, he'll back off.

09:33.606 --> 09:34.803
What's up with "hopefully"?

09:34.905 --> 09:37.401
Not to doubt you or anything,
but that ghost seemed pretty hardcore.

09:37.506 --> 09:39.403
Whenever they seem angry or evil,

09:39.508 --> 09:41.103
it just mostly means
that they're confused.

09:41.208 --> 09:43.300
So it's clueless? That makes
me feel a whole lot better.

09:43.405 --> 09:45.402
All right, listen. This is not
my first barbecue, ok?

09:45.508 --> 09:47.101
I will take care of it.

09:47.205 --> 09:50.303
Take a deep breath.

09:50.505 --> 09:54.300
Let's go get something to eat.

09:55.108 --> 09:56.500
Are you ok?

09:56.608 --> 09:57.800
My toe.

09:57.908 --> 09:59.400
I stubbed my toe.

09:59.507 --> 10:01.101
Was that the ghost?

10:01.206 --> 10:03.100
This one's just as scary.

10:03.207 --> 10:06.001
You know, as far as fright nights go,
this one rocks.

10:06.107 --> 10:10.900
Yeah. Let's hope your mom's
having as much fun.

10:11.407 --> 10:13.101
Any luck down there?

10:13.206 --> 10:14.500
This is...

10:14.605 --> 10:17.301
unbelievable.

10:17.406 --> 10:19.602
You know, this is a brand-new car, ok?

10:19.708 --> 10:23.101
These tires never blow out.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.302
I am so sorry.

10:24.405 --> 10:29.501
You know, normally, actually,
I can change a tire. Really.

10:29.606 --> 10:30.502
I guess I just...

10:30.606 --> 10:34.001
call a tow truck, right?

10:40.305 --> 10:44.903
Not lookin' good for
that second date, huh?

10:52.505 --> 10:54.201
Dare I even ask?

10:54.308 --> 10:58.302
Oh, you know, I just don't remember
dating being this challenging

10:58.405 --> 11:01.502
when I was younger.

11:02.007 --> 11:04.403
Yeah. I wouldn't even
know where to start.

11:04.505 --> 11:07.301
Frankly, I haven't
had a date go well yet.

11:07.408 --> 11:08.700
That's all right.

11:08.806 --> 11:13.402
You know why?
'Cause I'm gettin' out there.

11:13.605 --> 11:16.702
You know, Charlie and I,
we never even dated.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.201
How did you manage that?

11:18.305 --> 11:19.901
I was friends with his business partner,

11:20.006 --> 11:23.002
so we just started hangin' out.

11:23.107 --> 11:25.901
Anyway, how was your night? Did you
get the crap scared out of you?

11:26.006 --> 11:29.203
Ooh. Sure did.
Scary, scary.

11:29.307 --> 11:33.700
Anyway, Jim is on his way home,
so I'm gonna...

11:33.807 --> 11:38.202
Tim did see you guys at Lento's,
by the way.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.702
Was he upset about it?

11:39.808 --> 11:42.600
Jim called and said that he had
to let him win at pool all night

11:42.705 --> 11:44.600
just to sort of ease the pain.

11:44.705 --> 11:48.102
Is it awful of me that makes my night?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.900
No. I'd be worried about you
if it didn't.

11:51.007 --> 11:53.403
But I think you care more about Tim
than you'd like to admit,

11:53.505 --> 11:56.902
because I found these...

11:57.406 --> 12:00.501
in one of your magazines.

12:00.607 --> 12:02.203
Yes, I like him.

12:02.307 --> 12:05.203
We have a good time together.

12:05.307 --> 12:10.702
I'm just not ready to narrow
the playing field quite yet.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.200
I can't believe it.

12:16.307 --> 12:17.200
You know, poor Delia.

12:17.307 --> 12:20.803
It's hard enough to date as a single mom,
and then your son brings home a ghost.

12:20.905 --> 12:22.202
I just hope he doesn't
do any more damage.

12:22.307 --> 12:25.002
Well, if it's any consolation,
Tim is more determined than ever,

12:25.106 --> 12:27.903
and he wants me to scope out what
Delia likes so that he can impress her.

12:28.005 --> 12:32.202
Well, that's cute, but isn't part
of the fun of dating figuring it out?

12:32.307 --> 12:35.103
All right, was it fun when I asked you
to close your eyes for a bite of ho ho

12:35.208 --> 12:36.901
and you broke out in hives?

12:37.006 --> 12:41.201
Look, if you'd known I was allergic,
you wouldn't have gotten to play doctor.

12:41.307 --> 12:43.300
Good point.

12:43.407 --> 12:45.802
I'll tell him no.

12:45.905 --> 12:47.303
You're not really worried
about this ghost, are you?

12:47.406 --> 12:49.800
It's just... I don't know.
He's kinda creepy

12:49.905 --> 12:52.200
and in their apartment.

12:52.306 --> 12:55.703
- Are you gonna be able to talk to him?
- He doesn't seem like he's in a talkin

12:55.806 --> 12:59.900
so now I just have to go
and talk to the super.

13:00.008 --> 13:01.402
Please don't do that.

13:01.505 --> 13:03.202
My pants.
I need my pants.

13:03.306 --> 13:06.500
Yeah, and I would really love to
help you, but now is not a good time.

13:06.606 --> 13:09.901
Do we have a visitor?

13:11.706 --> 13:13.103
It's gone.

13:13.205 --> 13:15.801
Thank god.

13:16.006 --> 13:17.502
You should have seen
the look on your face.

13:17.607 --> 13:19.002
That must have been one freaky ghost.

13:19.205 --> 13:22.101
You have no idea.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.103
You know, Flaher,

13:27.206 --> 13:29.600
I never knew you were into bikes.

13:29.706 --> 13:31.501
It's a funny thing.
I didn't, either,

13:31.605 --> 13:34.801
but I just woke up with a picture
of this bike in my head like

13:34.906 --> 13:38.303
I'd been dreamin' about it.

13:38.407 --> 13:40.103
This isn't just a bike.

13:40.205 --> 13:42.103
This is a full-blown...

13:42.207 --> 13:45.100
midlife crisis.

13:48.207 --> 13:48.902
You hear that?

13:49.008 --> 13:52.303
Yeah. Sounds like
one dead battery comin' up.

13:52.408 --> 13:54.103
That guy's gonna be bummed.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.402
All right,

13:55.506 --> 13:59.503
you keep workin', and I will, too.

14:23.808 --> 14:27.401
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

14:28.805 --> 14:30.402
I can't believe he even talked to you.

14:30.506 --> 14:31.603
Must be because you're a babe.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.803
Oh, that, and I slipped him a 20,
but you know what? It worked. Look.

14:34.905 --> 14:37.203
We got to scratch 3 names off the list.

14:37.306 --> 14:39.603
But this guy Roy Smead,
he died 4 years ago,

14:39.706 --> 14:41.502
and he was known to have been
a bit of a recluse.

14:41.606 --> 14:43.100
Yeah. I remember something about him.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.201
You knew him?

14:44.308 --> 14:45.802
Nah. That was before we moved in,

14:45.906 --> 14:48.902
but Grant said he had all these
newspapers piled up in his apartment.

14:49.005 --> 14:50.701
They could hardly find
the body in the mess.

14:50.805 --> 14:53.700
Well, ok, so if he was a loner,
he'd be mad at you for disturbing him.

14:53.806 --> 14:54.901
But I'm not anymore.

14:55.006 --> 14:57.401
No, but it gives me time to get
some information on the family

14:57.508 --> 15:03.600
and find out if this ghost is
attached to something in the basement.

15:47.106 --> 15:48.700
What's up?

15:48.706 --> 15:51.400
What's up is I was trying to
surprise Delia with some flowers,

15:51.507 --> 15:54.302
but having no idea
what kind she liked, I didn't.

15:54.408 --> 15:57.702
- If you'd asked Melinda like I'd
wanted you to... - I asked her.

15:57.808 --> 15:59.002
You did? What'd she say?

15:59.107 --> 16:00.501
"Where's the sport in that?"

16:00.605 --> 16:02.201
Or something to that effect.

16:02.305 --> 16:04.102
Oh, yeah. I forgot. She hates me.

16:04.205 --> 16:07.000
- She doesn't hate you.
- No, she has to.

16:07.107 --> 16:12.402
I burned her girlfriend.
It's like a rule or something.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.901
Please. You have got...

16:22.207 --> 16:25.901
Clancy, your radio's busted.

16:31.708 --> 16:35.603
Just needed a more manly touch.

16:40.007 --> 16:44.200
I wish you could put some clothes on.

16:48.605 --> 16:50.902
Well, it's a really beautiful frame.

16:51.007 --> 16:52.503
You have great taste.

16:52.606 --> 16:56.600
Yeah, when you're picking it out.

16:58.008 --> 17:01.102
Oh, my God. What's wrong?

17:01.207 --> 17:02.803
Are you ok?

17:02.907 --> 17:04.800
Can I get you some water or something?

17:04.907 --> 17:06.701
Is it your heart?
Are you in pain?

17:06.808 --> 17:07.800
Are you all right?

17:07.907 --> 17:10.402
Charlie.

17:10.906 --> 17:13.501
Stay away!

17:18.007 --> 17:19.700
I would have seen him
around Delia by now,

17:19.807 --> 17:21.703
but sometimes when people
die of violent deaths,

17:21.805 --> 17:23.903
the longer they stay away,
the more confused they get.

17:24.005 --> 17:26.102
Maybe that explains why he's been
acting so out of character.

17:26.205 --> 17:28.301
It's like he's protective
of Ned and Delia,

17:28.405 --> 17:31.103
but in his state,
that can be dangerous.

17:31.206 --> 17:35.000
Now, at the risk of certain death,
can I suggest that maybe

17:35.108 --> 17:36.902
this is something you should
tell Delia about?

17:37.005 --> 17:38.102
I can handle it.

17:38.206 --> 17:40.001
I have to at least try.

17:40.107 --> 17:42.103
Ok. Fair enough.

17:42.205 --> 17:44.302
Besides, I need Charlie to be
a little more stable

17:44.408 --> 17:45.803
before I bring Ned in, you know?

17:45.905 --> 17:47.701
Delia told me that Charlie
had a business partner.

17:47.808 --> 17:49.203
Maybe that's who I need to talk to.

17:49.305 --> 17:53.603
I just can't go through Delia to do it.

17:54.705 --> 17:57.502
Oh, thank you.

17:59.607 --> 18:01.603
Charlie was a real force of nature,

18:01.707 --> 18:04.500
fun, warm, always helpin' people out.

18:04.605 --> 18:07.203
But I imagine if you work with Delia,
you already know that.

18:07.305 --> 18:09.503
Did she tell you he and I built
this business up from nothing?

18:09.608 --> 18:11.501
No, she didn't.
That's very impressive.

18:11.608 --> 18:13.003
We worked night and day.

18:13.108 --> 18:14.902
But all that changed after the fire.

18:15.007 --> 18:16.002
What fire?

18:16.105 --> 18:18.400
Our office building burned out
6 years ago.

18:18.507 --> 18:21.200
- Charlie was never the same
after that day. - How so?

18:21.306 --> 18:23.301
Not so driven.

18:23.508 --> 18:27.103
We rebuilt the business, but...
he just didn't care some much.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.503
Did it change the way
that he felt about his family?

18:29.606 --> 18:32.003
No, Charlie loved his family.

18:32.105 --> 18:36.002
He and Ned used to fly
all those planes together.

18:36.107 --> 18:39.501
I think I have still have a plan
somewhere in here.

18:39.608 --> 18:44.703
He was building it to suprise Ned
for his birthday.

18:44.905 --> 18:46.702
He designed it himself.

18:46.807 --> 18:48.502
Whatever happened to the plane?

18:48.606 --> 18:51.000
Lost in the fire.

18:51.108 --> 18:53.102
Never quite knew what to do with these.

18:53.205 --> 18:56.100
Afraid they might bring up
painful memories for Delia, but

18:56.206 --> 19:00.600
might mean somethin'
to his son, though.

19:01.405 --> 19:03.601
That sounds great.
Can you drop it by the store,

19:03.705 --> 19:05.702
or do you need me to pick it up?

19:05.806 --> 19:08.602
Ok. Terrific.

19:10.608 --> 19:14.102
Um, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

19:24.505 --> 19:25.702
So what do you think?

19:25.805 --> 19:27.901
It's pretty sweet, huh?

19:28.007 --> 19:30.503
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.

19:30.605 --> 19:33.703
Just had this impulse.
Bought it just like that.

19:33.807 --> 19:36.202
Crazy, huh?

19:36.305 --> 19:38.001
Why are you lookin' at me like that?

19:38.105 --> 19:40.303
Charlie had the exact same bike.

19:40.407 --> 19:44.401
- No, he...
- Yeah. 1957 BMW R69,

19:44.505 --> 19:46.001
just like this one.

19:46.105 --> 19:50.400
You must have seen a picture of it
when you picked me up the other night.

19:50.505 --> 19:54.501
I would never buy the exact same
bike Charlie had. That'd be...

19:54.605 --> 19:56.103
weird.

19:56.207 --> 19:58.101
Yeah.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.900
Sure would.

20:27.808 --> 20:29.501
Why are you still here?

20:29.605 --> 20:30.903
I told you. I need my pants.

20:31.005 --> 20:33.300
I promise you won't need
your pants in the light,

20:33.408 --> 20:34.401
and if you do,
that they'll be there,

20:34.508 --> 20:38.701
so why don't you just
do us both a favor and go?

20:38.808 --> 20:40.900
Don't get testy with me, girlfriend.

20:41.008 --> 20:42.800
I'm doin' all I can
to hold it together here.

20:42.906 --> 20:45.602
You see, that dream where you're
naked and you can't wake up,

20:45.707 --> 20:47.602
welcome to my life.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.201
Afterlife. Whatever.

20:49.305 --> 20:50.300
I don't know.

20:50.406 --> 20:57.300
Maybe you're right. Maybe I do have your
pants and that's why you're stalking me.

20:58.405 --> 21:00.601
Hey, I'm not stalking you.

21:00.708 --> 21:03.102
Ok, look, we got a shipment
of vintage in last week.

21:03.205 --> 21:05.402
I haven't looked at it yet.

21:05.507 --> 21:07.303
Can we just get this over with?
I have dinner waiting.

21:07.408 --> 21:08.701
Wait. My pants are in there?

21:08.806 --> 21:11.502
Let's pray.

21:11.706 --> 21:14.300
All right, do you see anything
that looks familiar?

21:14.405 --> 21:16.603
Well, maybe if you slowed down.

21:16.705 --> 21:20.801
Wait. That's them.
Those right there.

21:20.908 --> 21:24.502
- Are you private Jackson Reynolds?
- Yes. Yes, I am. That's me.

21:24.607 --> 21:26.201
Hallelujah. We have pants.

21:26.305 --> 21:29.700
Ok. Do you see a light?

21:39.506 --> 21:42.402
See you, guys. Later.

21:42.508 --> 21:44.602
I have something for you.

21:44.707 --> 21:48.201
It's plans for a model
that your dad drew.

21:48.306 --> 21:52.501
He was building it for your birthday.

21:53.005 --> 21:54.802
This is amazing.

21:54.908 --> 21:56.201
My dad drew this?

21:56.306 --> 21:57.902
It's...

21:58.007 --> 21:59.403
Wait.

21:59.508 --> 22:00.602
Why do you have 'em?

22:00.708 --> 22:04.302
Because I saw his partner.

22:04.708 --> 22:08.602
Look, Ned, I know that this
is gonna sound really crazy,

22:08.708 --> 22:13.200
but the ghost that's
been haunting you...

22:13.607 --> 22:15.800
it's your dad.

22:15.905 --> 22:17.300
What?

22:17.406 --> 22:19.902
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

22:20.006 --> 22:23.100
And I think that he's stuck
in one of those confused states.

22:23.207 --> 22:25.602
It sometimes happens.
He won't talk to me,

22:25.705 --> 22:27.702
but he might talk to you
if you'd be willing.

22:27.808 --> 22:28.900
Oh, my god.

22:29.008 --> 22:31.303
When?

22:33.406 --> 22:37.400
Ned, you know that you're gonna
have to tell him to move on,

22:37.507 --> 22:39.400
to cross over.

22:39.506 --> 22:40.601
What?

22:40.708 --> 22:43.301
- Why would I do that?
- Because...

22:43.405 --> 22:45.503
he's meant to be in the light,

22:45.605 --> 22:47.601
you know, not here.

22:47.708 --> 22:51.303
And it's not good for spirits
to stick around too long.

22:51.408 --> 22:53.500
It's hurting your dad.
It's hurting you guys.

22:53.606 --> 22:57.001
- That's not true.
- Ok, look, I know that you really...

22:57.108 --> 22:59.700
want your dad to be here.

22:59.806 --> 23:01.603
I wanted my dad, too,

23:01.705 --> 23:04.403
but the longer that he's here,
it makes it worse on everyone.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.103
Don't touch me!

23:06.205 --> 23:07.802
Dad wants to be with us.

23:07.907 --> 23:11.302
I'll never make him go.

23:38.406 --> 23:40.402
So,

23:40.506 --> 23:44.001
I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do here.

23:44.108 --> 23:47.001
I was kinda young when we did these.

23:47.108 --> 23:53.300
I'd always mess 'em up, and you'd
fix 'em later when I wasn't looking.

23:55.707 --> 23:59.100
But I'll be better now.

24:00.308 --> 24:02.502
The thing is, dad,

24:02.605 --> 24:05.302
I miss you.

24:06.107 --> 24:09.200
You were just so great, you know.

24:09.307 --> 24:12.903
There was nobody like you.

24:15.706 --> 24:19.002
Can you hear me, dad?

24:19.906 --> 24:21.502
Are you there?

24:21.605 --> 24:23.801
Ned.

24:27.605 --> 24:29.400
Look, mom,

24:29.505 --> 24:31.003
I can explain everything.

24:31.107 --> 24:32.203
Honey,

24:32.307 --> 24:34.400
you don't have to.

24:34.505 --> 24:37.301
I understand.

24:42.005 --> 24:43.701
You miss him.

24:43.805 --> 24:46.401
I do, too.

24:47.108 --> 24:51.102
You know, sometimes you feel ok,
and then...

24:51.206 --> 24:54.003
something reminds you of him,

24:54.107 --> 24:58.600
and you're right back
to where you were.

24:58.805 --> 25:01.400
It gets better.

25:01.507 --> 25:04.100
I promise.

25:05.607 --> 25:08.201
I promise.

25:14.108 --> 25:15.701
So maybe we could move,

25:15.808 --> 25:17.700
somewhere that no one would
ever come and visit,

25:17.806 --> 25:20.900
like the Antarctic or Queens.

25:21.005 --> 25:22.702
You're still gonna have to tell Delia.

25:22.805 --> 25:24.102
Yeah, I know, but when I do,

25:24.206 --> 25:26.700
who's to say that she's gonna
be able to get Charlie to move on?

25:26.808 --> 25:30.602
I mean, he was pretty clear about
the fact that he's not going anywhere.

25:30.707 --> 25:34.801
Then I'd be out a friend, a coworker,
and I'd gain a crazy ghost.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.501
- You really think he's crazy?
- I don't know.

25:36.607 --> 25:38.400
It just gives me the creeps,
the way that he's just trying

25:38.505 --> 25:40.402
to fit right back in with the family.

25:40.506 --> 25:46.202
One minute, he's with them, and then
the next, he gets shot at an ATM.

25:46.307 --> 25:48.403
I could see how that could make you crazy.

25:48.506 --> 25:52.401
Look, I probably should
have mentioned this before,

25:52.506 --> 25:55.501
but I think Tim's got
a ghost attached to him.

25:55.608 --> 25:56.203
What?

25:56.305 --> 25:59.900
I'm not really sure, but
he's got that look in his eyes.

26:00.006 --> 26:03.102
He keeps talking about purple flowers
and some song he keeps hearing.

26:03.206 --> 26:05.101
Oh, god.

26:05.207 --> 26:06.801
It's Charlie, right?

26:06.905 --> 26:11.003
Yeah, trying to protect Delia.
Now I really have to tell her.

26:11.107 --> 26:15.102
I think when you tell Delia your
secret, you will feel relieved.

26:15.205 --> 26:16.700
- You do?
- Yes.

26:16.807 --> 26:19.401
I think this has been harder on you
than you think, keepin' it inside.

26:19.505 --> 26:24.500
I think when you let it out,
everything'll be better.

26:24.608 --> 26:26.701
I don't know who gave you
the best husband handbook,

26:26.805 --> 26:30.503
but you're really good at it.

26:45.208 --> 26:48.602
This fell out of your pants.

26:48.707 --> 26:51.900
I think it's what's keeping you here.

26:52.005 --> 26:54.100
Maria Suarez.

26:54.206 --> 26:59.700
She was the most beautiful,
passionate, sexy woman I'd ever met.

26:59.806 --> 27:03.302
I was gonna ask her
to marry me that night,

27:03.408 --> 27:05.303
but then we had this stupid argument.

27:05.408 --> 27:06.503
So why didn't you?

27:06.608 --> 27:09.703
She brought that dumb, yippy dog
to the restaurant in her purse.

27:09.808 --> 27:13.903
Have you ever tried to ask someone
to marry you with a dog yipping?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.603
The worst.

27:16.708 --> 27:19.903
I got steamed, and I left.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.500
I went to a Buddy's,

27:22.605 --> 27:25.103
had a few beers.

27:25.205 --> 27:27.700
All right, like ten.

27:27.807 --> 27:30.501
Had this crazy idea
to run down to the lake.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.501
Without trunks.

27:32.605 --> 27:35.103
It was spur of the moment.

27:35.206 --> 27:38.602
I slipped on something.

27:40.205 --> 27:43.503
I wanted to marry her.

27:44.906 --> 27:47.501
She never even knew.

27:47.607 --> 27:50.400
She will now.

27:53.507 --> 27:57.201
Who were you just talkin'...

27:58.007 --> 27:59.201
What is up?

27:59.307 --> 28:01.501
You know, the other day,
you called somebody Charlie,

28:01.608 --> 28:05.703
and now you're talkin' to yourself.

28:06.105 --> 28:09.001
Actually I'm glad
that you brought that up.

28:09.105 --> 28:11.000
Ok.

28:11.107 --> 28:15.102
You know how sometimes when you...

28:16.207 --> 28:20.102
You know how you think that I...

28:21.805 --> 28:24.600
How do I say this?

28:24.707 --> 28:27.301
Oh, my god.

28:27.408 --> 28:29.801
Are you pregnant?
You're pregnant, aren't you?

28:29.907 --> 28:33.401
No. No, I'm not pregnant.

28:34.008 --> 28:36.803
I see ghosts.

28:38.207 --> 28:40.301
You're kidding, right?

28:40.407 --> 28:42.103
No.

28:42.207 --> 28:46.001
No, I'm not kidding, actually.

28:47.105 --> 28:49.300
That's insane.

28:49.407 --> 28:50.902
Why would you tell me this?

28:51.005 --> 28:53.602
Because you have a ghost
attached to you.

28:53.708 --> 28:57.202
Look, Delia, I know how you feel
about this stuff, and I really...

28:57.305 --> 28:59.402
I really didn't wanna
have to tell you, but...

28:59.505 --> 29:03.103
the reason that I am is because
the ghost that's attached to you...

29:03.207 --> 29:05.901
is Charlie.

29:08.908 --> 29:11.602
Oh, my god.

29:12.106 --> 29:14.302
Oh, my god.

29:14.405 --> 29:16.501
You told Ned this, didn't you?

29:16.606 --> 29:20.301
Yes, but he already knew, because
he had seen me talking to one once.

29:20.408 --> 29:22.602
And I know that i should have
told you first, and I'm so sorry.

29:22.707 --> 29:24.700
How dare you mess with
my kid like that?

29:24.808 --> 29:26.803
He thinks his dad's ghost is here.

29:26.905 --> 29:28.800
I heard him talking to him,
for god's sake.

29:28.905 --> 29:30.502
Well, he was.
Charlie...

29:30.606 --> 29:33.700
Just stop. Stop it.

29:34.108 --> 29:36.300
You need help.

29:36.406 --> 29:38.502
You need help, Melinda.

29:38.608 --> 29:40.303
And if you ever,

29:40.408 --> 29:45.103
ever talk to my son again,
so help me, god...

29:48.607 --> 29:52.402
how many times did I walk in here
and see you talking to yourself

29:52.506 --> 29:56.900
or acting all jittery?
And I never said a word, never.

29:57.005 --> 30:00.900
I just thought you were quirky...

30:01.005 --> 30:04.800
But it turns out you are nuts.

30:07.505 --> 30:09.903
And by the way,

30:10.006 --> 30:12.401
I quit.

30:16.805 --> 30:18.802
Things are not better.

30:18.905 --> 30:20.903
Now that she knows, they're worse.

30:21.006 --> 30:22.302
I'm sorry.

30:22.407 --> 30:25.801
I wish it would go away.

30:26.905 --> 30:29.903
I wish that I could wake up tomorrow
and it would just be gone.

30:30.007 --> 30:31.103
Don't say that.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.801
You do too much good with your gift.
You help too many people.

30:33.908 --> 30:37.203
What good is it if it hurts
the people that I love?

30:37.308 --> 30:38.901
Andrea, Delia,

30:39.005 --> 30:42.303
it did not help them.

30:42.607 --> 30:48.801
I can figure out perfect strangers'
ghosts, but I can't help my friends.

30:48.905 --> 30:52.001
That is not a gift.

31:01.508 --> 31:03.002
Ned.

31:03.106 --> 31:07.602
Were you playing with your dad's cologne?

31:12.406 --> 31:14.102
Ned,

31:14.208 --> 31:17.902
were you in your dad's stuff?

31:30.105 --> 31:34.302
Ned, if this is one of your pranks...

32:45.006 --> 32:49.900
I want you to tell me
what the hell is going on.

32:52.508 --> 32:54.001
This is crazy.

32:54.105 --> 32:56.103
I smelled his cologne.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.001
- How are you doing this?
- I'm not doing anything.

32:59.107 --> 33:02.101
Ok, think about it. What would
I gain by tricking you or anyone?

33:02.208 --> 33:03.800
I am not buying any of this, Melinda.

33:03.908 --> 33:07.403
- There's obviously some kind of
explanation for it. - Yeah, there is.

33:07.507 --> 33:09.401
You just don't wanna know about it.

33:09.505 --> 33:13.700
So you're saying Charlie is here
because he's trying to protect me.

33:13.808 --> 33:14.803
Yes.

33:14.908 --> 33:16.301
From what?

33:16.405 --> 33:18.102
Other men. I...

33:18.208 --> 33:19.100
I don't know.

33:19.207 --> 33:21.601
I don't know, ok?
It doesn't have to be rational.

33:21.706 --> 33:24.001
Trauma can affect people's
personalities dead or alive.

33:24.105 --> 33:24.901
You know, it's like Chad.

33:25.006 --> 33:27.700
- I mean, he said...
- You spoke with Chad?

33:27.808 --> 33:29.802
He said that...

33:29.908 --> 33:32.003
You know, it was hard for Charlie
and that his...

33:32.108 --> 33:34.602
he was not the same after the fire.

33:34.705 --> 33:38.303
That fire was the best thing
that ever happened to Charlie.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.800
Really?

33:41.208 --> 33:43.303
Charlie was a workaholic.

33:43.405 --> 33:48.002
For the first 7 years of Ned's life,
he was just this weekend warrior dad.

33:48.107 --> 33:49.602
So then what happened?

33:49.708 --> 33:53.403
I don't know why we are
talking about this.

33:53.508 --> 33:56.203
Because I...

33:56.508 --> 33:59.700
I really wanna know.

34:00.607 --> 34:03.803
I don't know what happened,

34:03.905 --> 34:05.703
but there was something
about that fire.

34:05.805 --> 34:08.003
We never talked about it.

34:08.108 --> 34:10.601
But afterwards, he was much happier.

34:10.706 --> 34:16.500
I just remember him saying
all the time, over and over again...

34:17.005 --> 34:22.900
"I just don't wanna wake up one day
thinking it was all a waste."

34:29.408 --> 34:32.203
Charlie was obsessed about
not wasting his life.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.699
Thanks, but what does that
have to do with the fire?

34:34.806 --> 34:40.103
He started saying that stuff
after the building burned.

34:40.406 --> 34:42.002
Report is printing.

34:42.105 --> 34:46.600
You know, everyone keeps saying that
something changed about Charlie that day.

34:46.708 --> 34:50.302
Nobody seems to know what.

35:00.708 --> 35:03.603
I know about you, Charlie.
You can stop hiding from me.

35:03.708 --> 35:06.700
You don't know anything.

35:06.806 --> 35:10.000
I know that Tim's the guy
that rescued you from the fire.

35:10.106 --> 35:14.001
See, I was thinking that it was
like all the other guys you were
driving away from Delia,

35:14.105 --> 35:15.302
but that's not true, is it?

35:15.407 --> 35:17.003
I told you to keep out of this.

35:17.106 --> 35:18.401
So then I was thinking

35:18.506 --> 35:19.803
the lavender roses,

35:19.908 --> 35:21.503
the song, the bike...

35:21.607 --> 35:24.000
all things that Delia likes.

35:24.107 --> 35:26.800
You're not trying to keep them apart.
You want them to be together.

35:26.906 --> 35:28.100
Look,

35:28.207 --> 35:31.800
you've already put everything
I've worked for at risk.

35:31.906 --> 35:33.300
I just need a little more time.

35:33.408 --> 35:38.000
And I just need to know
why you're doing this.

35:38.107 --> 35:40.700
I was workin' late, again.

35:40.808 --> 35:44.800
I was the only one in the office.

35:45.306 --> 35:47.400
Hurry up, guys.

35:47.505 --> 35:50.603
Come on! Hurry up!

35:50.808 --> 35:55.200
I just saw my life going down in flames.

35:55.305 --> 35:56.401
Don't go in there!

35:56.507 --> 35:59.501
I didn't listen.

36:04.405 --> 36:07.300
And I realized right at that moment

36:07.408 --> 36:09.101
that it wasn't about the files.

36:09.207 --> 36:13.601
It was about my life
with Ned and Delia.

36:19.506 --> 36:24.201
- Captain, I'm goin' in!
- Careful, Flaherty!

36:31.606 --> 36:34.600
When I came to, I was delirious.

36:34.706 --> 36:40.101
I remember, lookin' up into that face,
and just I was so happy to be alive.

36:40.208 --> 36:42.001
I was so happy

36:42.108 --> 36:44.603
to get a second chance.

36:44.706 --> 36:45.300
Thank you so much.

36:45.406 --> 36:47.501
I told him I would never forget him,
I would...

36:47.608 --> 36:51.302
I would never forget how he risked
his life to save mine,

36:51.405 --> 36:54.702
but he told me
he didn't see it that way.

36:54.805 --> 36:58.800
He just tried to do the best he could
with every day that he had.

36:58.906 --> 37:02.800
I'll never wake up thinkin' it was
all a waste, you know.

37:02.908 --> 37:05.203
He just knew

37:05.306 --> 37:07.600
what took me so long to realize,

37:07.706 --> 37:11.402
and thank god I did, because
3 years later, I was gone.

37:11.508 --> 37:14.500
So you wanted him to take care
of Ned and Delia.

37:14.605 --> 37:17.900
I just knew he was the one,
you know? I felt it.

37:18.006 --> 37:21.600
So she starts dating, and you
make sure that they all go badly.

37:21.706 --> 37:24.500
And it was goin' fine
until you butted in.

37:24.606 --> 37:26.502
I'm the one who wanted
them to be together,

37:26.606 --> 37:28.501
so why wouldn't you just come to me?

37:28.608 --> 37:29.800
'Cause I didn't trust you.

37:29.906 --> 37:33.302
So instead you gave hints to Tim
on how to win her over.

37:33.406 --> 37:38.103
- Not the greatest plan.
- Oh, I did much more than that.

37:38.205 --> 37:41.600
It was a long time ago.

37:42.007 --> 37:45.401
I knew she needed the lamps
for her open house.

37:45.508 --> 37:47.802
Damn.

38:00.006 --> 38:02.101
So I sent her to you.

38:02.206 --> 38:05.901
Come on, mom.
I'm gonna be late.

38:06.007 --> 38:07.201
Let's go.

38:07.308 --> 38:09.403
And you brought her to Tim.

38:09.505 --> 38:12.002
You know, it may not work out, but...

38:12.106 --> 38:16.501
I wanted them at least to have a chance.

38:18.006 --> 38:19.702
Tim rescued my dad?

38:19.805 --> 38:21.902
She's never gonna believe you,

38:22.007 --> 38:24.102
but at least she likes Tim now,

38:24.205 --> 38:26.203
so you can't completely screw things up.

38:26.306 --> 38:29.100
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

38:29.208 --> 38:31.400
Who are you talking to?

38:31.506 --> 38:33.601
She's talking to dad, mom.

38:33.705 --> 38:36.302
He's here.

38:36.605 --> 38:39.301
Ned, it's time to say good-bye.

38:39.406 --> 38:41.603
It's time for him to go,
but before he does,

38:41.705 --> 38:44.902
he wants to tell you why he tried
to scare you in the basement.

38:45.007 --> 38:46.601
Don't you?

38:46.707 --> 38:50.000
I did a lot of crazy things
when I was a kid,

38:50.105 --> 38:52.900
startin' about your age, and, uh...

38:53.006 --> 38:55.801
it got me into a whole
bunch of trouble,

38:55.907 --> 38:57.902
and I still regret it.

38:58.007 --> 39:02.602
And I just wanna keep you from
having to go through all that.

39:02.705 --> 39:06.401
Ned, your dad did a lot of messed-up
things when he was your age,

39:06.505 --> 39:10.902
and he just wants to keep you
from making those same mistakes.

39:11.006 --> 39:13.401
I get it,

39:13.507 --> 39:17.503
and I'm glad you came back, dad, but...

39:17.608 --> 39:20.800
you don't have to worry
about us anymore.

39:20.905 --> 39:22.603
I can take care of things.

39:22.705 --> 39:25.400
I know you can, son.

39:25.505 --> 39:28.102
You grew up so well.

39:28.206 --> 39:31.600
I'm proud of you, buddy.

39:32.306 --> 39:35.301
All I want is you to be happy now.

39:35.406 --> 39:39.801
I want you to find
the love you deserve.

39:40.606 --> 39:42.601
What was that?

39:42.705 --> 39:45.003
He's saying good-bye,

39:45.106 --> 39:49.900
and he says that he wants you
to be happy now.

39:50.607 --> 39:53.603
And to find love.

39:55.808 --> 39:57.202
Ok, um...

39:57.306 --> 39:59.002
I'm sorry, but I just... I can't...

39:59.106 --> 40:01.501
Delia.

40:01.706 --> 40:03.700
What if Charlie wasn't dead?

40:03.808 --> 40:08.303
What if he was here
and you had no doubt?

40:09.206 --> 40:12.302
What would you say?

40:13.106 --> 40:15.301
Mom.

40:15.906 --> 40:18.303
Please.

40:27.505 --> 40:29.801
I would...

40:29.907 --> 40:31.600
I would say...

40:31.705 --> 40:34.201
that he made me happy, too,

40:34.305 --> 40:38.002
more than he could ever know.

40:38.406 --> 40:41.601
That he gave me peace,

40:41.705 --> 40:44.503
and I would...

40:44.706 --> 40:47.403
I would say, "I love you,"

40:47.505 --> 40:50.202
and that, "I will always,

40:50.307 --> 40:53.303
always love you. "

40:54.108 --> 40:55.602
I love you.

40:55.707 --> 40:59.101
I love you both so much.

41:00.306 --> 41:03.101
He loves you, too.

41:03.208 --> 41:05.901
Both of you.

41:07.305 --> 41:10.103
And thank you.

42:12.805 --> 42:14.100
- I just thought I'd...
- You know what?

42:14.207 --> 42:17.302
Before you say anything, can I just...

42:17.406 --> 42:20.801
I'm really sorry that I went
behind your back with Ned.

42:20.907 --> 42:22.202
I know you are.

42:22.306 --> 42:24.502
Thank you.

42:24.607 --> 42:25.800
Here's the thing.

42:25.905 --> 42:30.501
I think the reason
why I got so mad, so hurt

42:31.108 --> 42:34.801
is because you're just
so important to me.

42:34.905 --> 42:37.603
You have been such an amazing friend,

42:37.707 --> 42:40.503
and I know you're a good person.
I know you are.

42:40.608 --> 42:42.402
Just nuts.

42:42.505 --> 42:45.702
Yeah, slightly nuts.

42:45.805 --> 42:48.802
But I don't wanna lose your friendship,

42:48.907 --> 42:51.700
and I just...

42:52.207 --> 42:55.902
I just can't go where you go.

42:57.105 --> 42:59.101
Can you understand that?

42:59.208 --> 43:02.302
I understand that.

43:10.207 --> 43:13.000
How did he know lavender roses
were my favorite?

43:13.107 --> 43:16.602
Do you really wanna know?

43:21.705 --> 43:24.201
Tomorrow,

43:24.407 --> 43:25.700
you want me to open up?

43:25.805 --> 43:29.002
That would be great.
