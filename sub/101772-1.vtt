WEBVTT

01:49.076 --> 01:50.611
I'm so hungry, Mommy.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.580
ell then you should'veW
rought some food.b

01:52.613 --> 01:53.914
You don't have anything?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.349
Stop, unless you
want a slap.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.251
Stop fucking complaining.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.949
It's me.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.918
Hi, baby, where are you?

02:30.951 --> 02:32.386
When are you coming home?

02:32.720 --> 02:34.455
I'm runnin' out of
eggs and Advil.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.491
My back's
got me flopped.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.329
I'll be back before
the food runs out.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.796
Don't worry, Mama.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.666
You in the woods?

02:47.235 --> 02:48.402
What ya huntin'?

02:48.969 --> 02:50.571
Did you find the letter, Mama?

02:51.305 --> 02:52.740
Can you read it to me?

02:52.740 --> 02:54.675
I ain't readin' it.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.577
I told you what it said.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.247
Can you read me the letter,
please?

03:01.682 --> 03:03.251
The lawyer I sent

03:03.251 --> 03:05.286
is harassing your daddy
for back payments.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.420
Your daddy don't like it,

03:06.454 --> 03:09.156
so the broke cheapskate's
gonna come and kill me.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.429
He didn't say
nothin' about me?

03:16.497 --> 03:17.698
No.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.770
Oh well, I need
the return address.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.771
You don't need that.

03:23.771 --> 03:24.838
Yes, I do.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.106
Why you need it?

03:28.175 --> 03:30.378
I'll make it so you can
sleep again at night.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.214
Yeah, how you gonna do that?

03:37.351 --> 03:39.186
I'm gonna make
things right.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.126
What are you talkin' about?

03:47.461 --> 03:49.563
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.231
You ain't known him
since you were six.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.232
You want to know him?

03:52.300 --> 03:54.335
Take a look at
my broken back.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.003
You stay away from Colton.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.004
There's nothing good there.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.472
I love you, Mama.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.812
Man, I'd sure as hell

05:11.879 --> 05:14.281
hate to be the one
you're gonna go see.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.252
Why don't you hop in?

05:19.286 --> 05:20.721
I can give you a ride.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.056
No, thanks.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.263
Then how 'bout, uh,

05:30.297 --> 05:31.732
offer you a little water?

05:45.746 --> 05:48.416
I-I-I'm not doin'
nothin' wrong, okay.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.350
I'm just walkin'
down a road.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.420
Well, I'm just
drivin' down a road.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.493
Well-

07:20.608 --> 07:22.442
Sorry .

07:24.277 --> 07:26.346
It was just on the radio.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.917
This song was just
on the radio.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.184
I wasn't really-

07:31.184 --> 07:32.953
But I like this song, hell.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.877
How do I find out
where people live here?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.312
Do you mean the phonebook?

08:00.280 --> 08:01.481
A phonebook?

08:03.216 --> 08:05.052
The book over by the phone.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.172
So who are you
lookin' for?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.114
You stay away
from The Brothers

09:07.114 --> 09:08.448
if you plan on
stickin' around.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.117
My private advice to you.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.887
What brothers?

09:15.355 --> 09:16.790
Where is she from?

09:17.858 --> 09:19.126
She can talk.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.863
Get her another.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.633
On me.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.801
I can buy my own.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.371
Betty
Who are you?

09:31.404 --> 09:32.806
Fuck off, Betty.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.909
I used to be pretty once.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.411
People used to buy
me drinks too.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.513
Go to CW's if you
want a free drink.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.318
You know CW?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.587
He ain't been around.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.090
Dodgin' you, like I am.

09:54.728 --> 09:55.696
Hey, hey, come on!

10:11.011 --> 10:12.412
Where's Root Road?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.179
CW James!

11:52.112 --> 11:53.546
Daddy?

14:10.517 --> 14:11.751
Mmmm.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.354
Daddy.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.725
What the-

15:11.044 --> 15:13.046
Who did this to you, huh?

15:13.713 --> 15:15.148
Who?

15:18.485 --> 15:23.490
I, I was gonna do this to you.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.566
Look at me.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.835
Look at me, Daddy!

15:36.669 --> 15:39.506
Look at me, huh!

15:48.681 --> 15:50.683
Because I'm all
grown up, Daddy.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.085
Hello!

18:07.320 --> 18:08.555
Hello?

18:18.665 --> 18:20.333
Who wears this shit?

18:46.859 --> 18:48.528
Why doesn't my cell work?

18:48.928 --> 18:50.463
We're in the dark zone here.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.131
The towers all miss us.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.969
When does the
sheriff's office open?

18:58.538 --> 19:00.740
The sheriff works
strange hours.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.942
So then where
do I find him?

19:02.975 --> 19:04.377
You mean the sheriff?

19:06.546 --> 19:07.647
You need the sheriff,

19:07.714 --> 19:09.716
your best chances are
sitting right here.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.886
He's not here yet.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.558
Need some milk?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.340
That jacket lives
on Root Road.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.478
You must be the daughter.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.083
You know about me?

19:48.655 --> 19:49.856
Go home.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.169
Yeah?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.505
He's dead.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.706
What?

20:06.773 --> 20:07.940
Who's dead?

20:08.275 --> 20:09.542
I'm in Golden,

20:09.609 --> 20:11.611
and I found him,
but he's dead.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.613
Tell me it wasn't you.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.383
Someone tortured
him I think.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.952
It just doesn't
make sense, Mama,

20:19.952 --> 20:20.953
Me gettin' here

20:20.953 --> 20:22.455
and then somebody
already done that to him.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.056
Didn't I tell you
to stay away?

20:24.123 --> 20:26.326
You get out of
there right now.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.060
Whoever done this
is still there.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.296
I'm in town.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.663
It's not safe
there either.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.131
You come straight home.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.534
I'm not comin' home Mama

20:34.567 --> 20:36.836
until I find out
who did this.

20:36.869 --> 20:37.870
You don't owe him nothin'.

20:37.904 --> 20:38.871
You don't know that town.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.139
There's somethin'
broken there.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.508
Yeah and I'm gonna
find out what-

20:41.541 --> 20:43.009
Oh, don't you
bother with that!

20:43.042 --> 20:44.243
Get home now!

20:47.079 --> 20:49.516
Okay, I'll get on
the night bus.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.184
But when I come home
can I read his letter?

20:52.218 --> 20:53.420
Just come home.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.524
He's an egg.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.892
I mean, it doesn't
say that anywhere.

20:59.926 --> 21:00.993
Everyone knows
he's an egg.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.762
Yeah, but how?
It doesn't say that.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.063
Look, guy sits on a wall.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.698
Ah, has a great fall.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.601
All the horses, all the men
can't put him together again.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.837
No mention of an egg.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.673
Why else would he crack open
when he falls off the wall

21:13.673 --> 21:15.007
if he wasn't an egg?

21:20.580 --> 21:22.415
Why do you keep
staring at me?

21:27.854 --> 21:29.088
Listen.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.025
I don't know why but I
gotta tell you somethin'.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.629
I gotta kill-

21:37.430 --> 21:39.699
I gotta protect my
daughter from the monsters,

21:41.601 --> 21:45.438
except I'm one of the
monsters and so is her mama.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.040
I mean, you shoot her
with eight dart guns,

21:48.040 --> 21:49.208
and she'll still
come runnin' at ya.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.277
She got the drug endurance
of a woolly mammoth.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.279
And she's the
more fit parent.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.883
I mean, I think about my
baby girl bein' with her mama

21:56.883 --> 21:58.818
or bein' with me,
and it, it hits me.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.052
It hits me like-

22:00.453 --> 22:03.289
I mean, she's gonna
get exactly what I had,

22:03.322 --> 22:05.592
a dumb dad and
batshit mom

22:05.625 --> 22:07.627
and a town that just
wants to swallow her

22:07.660 --> 22:10.663
unless I do the impossible
and kill all the monsters.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.166
Then why are sittin'
in a bar drinkin',

22:14.233 --> 22:15.835
feelin' sorry for yourself?

22:18.471 --> 22:20.807
Ain't that what
you're doin'?

22:20.840 --> 22:23.242
Well, I don't have a
little girl waitin' on me.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.579
Well you got all the
answers there, don't you?

22:29.516 --> 22:31.350
Lookin' for answers.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.920
About what?

22:44.597 --> 22:46.999
If someone bad dies
it's good, right?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.602
Someone died?

22:53.773 --> 22:55.608
Someone-someone
close to you?

23:00.513 --> 23:01.948
Can I get you something?

23:03.516 --> 23:05.518
No, but you can get
yourself another drink.

23:14.527 --> 23:15.628
Or you can be a man

23:15.628 --> 23:17.630
and get your daughter
the hell outta here.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.702
To gettin' the hell out.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.911
What if it was
a female egg?

23:31.978 --> 23:33.245
What if he's not
an egg at all?

23:33.312 --> 23:35.682
What if he's just like
some fool like CW,

23:35.715 --> 23:37.383
and The Brothers threw
him off the wall,

23:37.416 --> 23:39.719
and he cracked open all over
the floor and just cried?

23:45.157 --> 23:46.726
We're not so different.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.496
Why do you keep
hounding me, lady?

23:49.496 --> 23:51.397
'Cause you got
your dad's eyes.

23:55.401 --> 23:56.836
So you knew my daddy?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.507
Knew?

25:26.158 --> 25:28.160
Got an extra t-shirt,
if you need it.

25:31.998 --> 25:32.965
Hmm?

25:32.999 --> 25:34.200
All right.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.771
Oh, I'm all for the skin,

25:38.805 --> 25:40.773
but you better be careful
around here like that.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.341
The men of this town
would fuck the does

25:42.374 --> 25:44.010
if they could catch 'em.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.780
You know, apparently most
of the whole town goes back

25:47.780 --> 25:48.781
to like two or
three families.

25:48.781 --> 25:49.782
If you think about it,

25:49.782 --> 25:51.350
I mean, half these
jerk offs are shackin' up

25:51.383 --> 25:53.686
with an aunt or an uncle
and they don't even know it.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.889
There's a sick sense of love
that goes through this town.

25:56.956 --> 25:57.890
That's my point.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.125
What's your name?

26:01.628 --> 26:03.963
Yeah, I don't like
tellin' my name either.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.633
You know a face,
a person, a soul.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.467
Shit, what do you
need a name for?

26:12.038 --> 26:13.505
You're just like
passin' through,

26:13.539 --> 26:15.041
on some kind of a hike or?

26:19.311 --> 26:20.680
You let me know if I'm
over-talking, okay.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.148
I'm very aware of myself.

26:22.481 --> 26:23.883
You're over-talking.

26:24.550 --> 26:25.985
Oh, all right.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.487
Just gonna leave
you be now.

26:34.661 --> 26:36.929
You know, I just wanna know
ther people I guess, you know,o

26:36.996 --> 26:38.530
and I got a
knack for words.

26:38.564 --> 26:40.332
My brother says
it's obnoxious.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.333
You know,
if talk is wrong,

26:41.333 --> 26:42.501
then I wouldn't
wanna be right,

26:42.501 --> 26:43.836
because then I wouldn't be
talkin' with your right now,

26:43.836 --> 26:45.071
would I?

26:45.337 --> 26:46.505
Or talkin' at you.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.009
If it wasn't for
you starin' at me,

26:50.009 --> 26:51.577
I'd think you
were a mannequin.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.013
Right?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.015
Yeah.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.918
I used to find mannequins
sexy as a kid.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.688
Didn't say I was absent
from the sick sense of love

27:01.688 --> 27:04.056
that goes through
this town, did I?

27:04.090 --> 27:06.092
You are what you are.

27:08.194 --> 27:12.131
Ancestry, hmm,
that's a good word.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.599
Do you know that word?

27:14.266 --> 27:17.303
o, oh, ancestry'sN
like that creek out there.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.205
Okay, just because you're
your own arm in the river,

27:19.205 --> 27:21.273
all your water still
comes from that same big,

27:21.307 --> 27:22.574
fucked up chunk of ice,

27:22.608 --> 27:23.575
and do you know,

27:23.609 --> 27:25.912
that big fucked up chunk
of ice is chasin' you?

27:25.945 --> 27:27.146
Did you know that?

27:27.479 --> 27:31.617
Oh yeah, really, really
slowly but it is chasing you,

27:31.650 --> 27:33.085
and it will catch you,
and you know it will,

27:33.119 --> 27:34.586
so the whole thing
just feels stupid.

27:34.620 --> 27:39.058
What the hell are you
even talkin' about, man?

27:39.058 --> 27:40.492
No, mm mm.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.762
I know you know what
I'm talking about.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.797
It's written on you
like a face tattoo.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.166
Running from the big
fucked up chunk of ice.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.071
I don't think you
have all your screws.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.742
Ah!

28:01.848 --> 28:03.850
What, you got like a
thing for kindling?

28:08.587 --> 28:10.790
Can see why you have
a knack for words?

28:10.823 --> 28:12.024
Why is that?

28:13.259 --> 28:14.193
Practice.

28:19.598 --> 28:22.601
You want some, um,
rehydrated jerky?

28:24.203 --> 28:26.172
It's boiled just
a baby bit,

28:26.205 --> 28:27.606
It comes out like steak.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.277
Hmm?

28:34.346 --> 28:35.547
You eat that?

28:35.614 --> 28:36.983
Yeah.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.657
You're a strange guy.

28:45.691 --> 28:46.793
Yeah, you like me.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.027
I can tell.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.464
What's with this hatchet?

28:56.068 --> 28:57.469
It was my daddy's.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.138
Hmm.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.207
Daddy's girl, huh?

29:04.310 --> 29:06.578
He taught me how to
throw it when I was six.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.817
I stopped knowing him
when I was six so.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.419
You any good at it?

29:23.495 --> 29:24.730
Oh shit.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.500
Shit!

29:29.836 --> 29:31.570
I won some competitions.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.005
I bet you did.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.845
Can I feel it?

29:40.412 --> 29:41.848
You can hold my knife.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.289
Ah, shit!

29:50.356 --> 29:51.523
Yeah.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.026
Well, that's-

29:54.026 --> 29:55.261
That's good.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.201
Yeah.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.371
Tight head.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.373
Perfect weight distribution.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.609
Any chance I get,

30:10.642 --> 30:13.645
I'm in the woods with
my hatchet and my rod.

30:15.214 --> 30:19.251
I really wanna live
out there one day,

30:19.285 --> 30:23.122
but I can't 'cause I
gotta take care of my mama.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.392
Take care of Mama?

30:42.241 --> 30:43.842
Oh, you, yeah okay.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.493
I made you blush.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.996
No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

31:09.035 --> 31:12.871
Hey, can I, um, mm,

31:14.340 --> 31:15.774
can I shake your hand?

31:19.278 --> 31:20.712
I'm not asking for a kiss.

31:21.613 --> 31:22.814
You don't like
how it feels,

31:22.848 --> 31:25.051
I give you full right
just to chop it off.

31:53.479 --> 31:58.684
she left

32:08.560 --> 32:14.900
I'm alone, I'm alone!

32:16.002 --> 32:17.236
Daddy's girl.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.070
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

32:51.103 --> 32:52.071
Stop punching yourself!

32:52.104 --> 32:53.105
Stop punching yourself!

32:53.139 --> 32:54.806
Ah, huh, oh!

32:54.873 --> 32:57.109
No, no!

32:59.711 --> 33:01.780
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

33:01.813 --> 33:04.816
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

33:14.626 --> 33:15.894
Oh shit!

33:15.894 --> 33:17.129
Huh?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.667
Still wanna fuck me?

33:24.136 --> 33:26.105
Even more.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.273
Hey.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.076
Drop it.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.679
But ,

33:33.745 --> 33:35.281
he killed my daddy.

33:35.314 --> 33:37.316
Look, he's got my
daddy's watch on,

33:37.349 --> 33:38.917
and Daddy's dead
up at his house.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.352
He killed him.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.522
Well if that's so
I'll-I'll make it right.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.760
You promise you'll
make it right?

33:48.760 --> 33:50.762
Oh, you bet your
ass I will.

34:32.138 --> 34:36.142
So she said, uh, you
killed her daddy.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.144
Her daddy.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.914
Sweetheart, how well did
you, uh, know your daddy?

34:45.317 --> 34:46.718
I see you're a smart girl.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.991
Let me introduce you
to this dude here.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.493
He's my half-brother.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.495
My mom was
prettier than his.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.097
My mom was beautiful.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.401
People around here like
to call us The Brothers.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.870
And they call
me the Charmer,

35:04.903 --> 35:06.037
because when I was 14-

35:06.071 --> 35:08.340
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up, hm?

35:12.077 --> 35:13.679
Where are you
guys taking me?

35:15.514 --> 35:16.948
Where do you think?

35:17.583 --> 35:18.784
To get the money.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.520
What money?

35:22.020 --> 35:25.023
The money your dad's got
hidden on his property.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.359
What are you talkin' about?

35:27.359 --> 35:29.528
Daddy never had no dime.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.530
Well, you saw the letter,
didn't ya?

35:34.099 --> 35:35.301
The letter that-

35:35.767 --> 35:37.203
The letter that Daddy wrote?

35:37.469 --> 35:38.537
That's the one.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.539
How do you know
about the letter?

35:41.540 --> 35:44.743
It's no little coincidence
that you come into town,

35:44.776 --> 35:46.412
just as word gets around

35:46.445 --> 35:48.447
that your old man's
got some money hidden.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.716
Does your mama
know you're here?

35:52.651 --> 35:54.286
How do you know my mama?

35:59.991 --> 36:01.627
How do you know
about the letter?

36:05.397 --> 36:06.565
Hey!

36:06.998 --> 36:07.966
How do you know
about the letter?

36:07.999 --> 36:08.967
Well, feel like a drive?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.503
I do feel like
going for a drive.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.739
How do you two
know about the letter, huh?

36:13.739 --> 36:15.641
Shit, I love your spirit!

36:15.674 --> 36:17.309
Hah, hah, hah, hah!

36:17.909 --> 36:19.778
I feel like a nice drive too.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.112
How do you know?

36:23.315 --> 36:25.484
Where are you
guys taking me?

37:17.303 --> 37:18.304
Come on.

37:20.639 --> 37:21.707
Shit!

37:21.740 --> 37:22.708
Fuck!

37:44.896 --> 37:46.898
Now what the fuck am
I gonna do with you?

37:52.771 --> 37:56.342
Well you are one crazy-ass gal,
you know that?

37:57.676 --> 37:59.511
I kinda like you
a little bit.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.247
You remind me of somebody,

38:03.349 --> 38:04.750
somebody familiar.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.019
I used to have
a kid sister,

38:09.621 --> 38:11.022
just like you, wild.

38:11.857 --> 38:14.025
Yeah, real wild ass child.

38:19.264 --> 38:21.099
Poor thing, she
didn't know how to-

38:22.368 --> 38:23.569
how to find the daylight.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.405
She just kept
digging herself a-

38:26.438 --> 38:29.741
a deep dark hole she
couldn't climb out of.

38:29.775 --> 38:32.243
Drank so much she fell out
of the back of our pickup,

38:32.277 --> 38:33.712
nearly paralyzed her.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.284
What the fuck is this?

38:39.785 --> 38:41.052
Hey, stupid!

38:41.052 --> 38:42.588
Didn't I tell you
to bury this?

38:42.621 --> 38:44.556
Yeah, I was gonna but
I-I had to do laundry,

38:44.556 --> 38:46.558
so then I forgot
all about it, so.

38:46.558 --> 38:47.893
Forgot all about it?

38:47.893 --> 38:49.127
Yeah.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.230
Just put the motherfucker
in the ground.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.465
Yeah, yeah.

38:57.969 --> 39:02.408
Now, I got one question
I wanna ask you.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.077
Where's your daddy's money?

39:09.581 --> 39:11.583
Did you try the bank first?

39:19.090 --> 39:20.258
When it gets all
chilly like this,

39:20.258 --> 39:21.860
my hands get all
swelled up and,

39:21.927 --> 39:25.096
I can't close my knuckles,
you know.

39:26.498 --> 39:27.466
They lock up.

39:27.499 --> 39:28.667
My knuckles get swollen.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.103
Oh shit, I wanna play!

39:41.447 --> 39:44.783
Sweetheart, your daddy
didn't believe in no banks.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.485
No, my daddy also
had no money,

39:46.518 --> 39:48.119
'cause he was
a broke fuck!

39:49.621 --> 39:51.557
What the fuck are
you doing here?

39:51.623 --> 39:52.891
Taking a vacation?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.860
Oh this is a real
nice vacation town.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.964
If I told you you
wouldn't believe me anyway.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.839
You know, this little thing
here could do a lot of damage.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.044
To a pretty little
thing like you.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.427
Where's your daddy's money?

40:39.170 --> 40:40.371
I know where it is!

40:40.405 --> 40:41.540
I know where the money is.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.248
Talk to me.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.051
It's -

40:57.623 --> 40:58.690
It's in the tub.

40:58.690 --> 40:59.925
Huh?

41:02.427 --> 41:04.863
It's underneath the bathtub.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.099
Under the tub?

41:08.133 --> 41:09.367
That's where it is.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.202
I said we should
look under the tub.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.972
Well, go look under the
fuckin' tub, brother.

41:14.039 --> 41:15.440
Well you go look.

41:16.441 --> 41:17.876
No, I wanna look.

41:34.392 --> 41:39.064
There ain't no reason that
me and you can't get along.

41:42.568 --> 41:44.670
Ain't no reason why
we can't be friends.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.509
We could work
somethin' out.

41:55.413 --> 41:56.481
Hey.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.256
Honey.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.195
Mm.

42:12.664 --> 42:13.699
I can't move that.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.166
I can't move it at all.

42:18.604 --> 42:20.538
It's too heavy for me.

42:20.606 --> 42:21.773
Get that fuckin'
thing outta here.

42:21.773 --> 42:23.775
Yeah, yeah, I'll
cover it with something.

42:28.013 --> 42:30.015
Gotta protect
her virgin eyes.

42:42.694 --> 42:45.196
This is a technique
called sonar tapping.

42:46.131 --> 42:48.333
Blind people and
dolphins do it

42:48.366 --> 42:49.901
to see things in the dark.

42:54.873 --> 42:56.074
Ah, god!

43:07.653 --> 43:10.656
Ah, that's good,
I got it, okay.

43:13.725 --> 43:14.893
Ah!

43:19.998 --> 43:21.499
Ah!

43:21.499 --> 43:22.868
Ah, yeah!

43:29.107 --> 43:30.341
Fuck!

43:32.110 --> 43:33.511
Goddammit!

43:40.185 --> 43:41.787
No there's nothing here!

43:42.620 --> 43:44.890
She's got us on
a goose chase.

43:46.591 --> 43:47.558
Shit.

44:05.443 --> 44:06.644
Shit.

44:07.879 --> 44:08.980
Oh!

46:30.255 --> 46:32.257
It doesn't make
any sense.

47:16.734 --> 47:18.569
What the fuck
happened to you?

47:24.309 --> 47:26.144
You mind if I
warm up in here?

47:27.812 --> 47:29.247
Nicest room I got.

47:36.421 --> 47:38.423
What do you know
about some money?

47:42.660 --> 47:43.861
Just rumours.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.935
How did these Brothers
know about my family?

47:57.775 --> 47:59.177
Do you know
where they live?

48:00.711 --> 48:02.680
Whatever you got going
on with these guys,

48:02.713 --> 48:03.949
it ain't good.

48:04.615 --> 48:05.650
The Brothers and
their family,

48:05.683 --> 48:08.386
they've been breaking
this town for years.

48:08.453 --> 48:10.288
Well, we're broken.

48:11.022 --> 48:13.358
And there ain't a damn
thing we can do about it.

48:16.962 --> 48:18.629
I have to know
what's going on.

48:19.464 --> 48:21.466
The one time I knew
what was going on,

48:23.468 --> 48:24.502
I lost my toes.

48:24.535 --> 48:25.971
That's The Brothers.

48:27.705 --> 48:30.141
Knowing and not knowing
don't mean a damn thing.

48:31.309 --> 48:33.478
There's havin' toes
and not havin' toes.

48:35.380 --> 48:37.048
Do you think you're
making this place better

48:37.082 --> 48:40.418
with all that toeless,
coward pussy talk?

48:40.485 --> 48:42.553
There ain't no makin'
this place better.

48:44.555 --> 48:45.556
You're the nicest person

48:45.590 --> 48:46.924
that probably came
through here ever,

48:46.992 --> 48:48.926
and you're waving
a hatchet around,

48:48.994 --> 48:50.395
wanting to kill people.

48:54.399 --> 48:56.234
Bus is comin' through soon.

48:57.268 --> 48:58.669
You should be on it.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.607
Are you gonna tell
me where they live?

49:04.909 --> 49:07.912
You know, it's a fine line
between brave and stupid.

49:09.514 --> 49:11.949
It's a fine line
between coward and smart.

49:13.251 --> 49:15.086
Last house on
Black Lake Road.

49:20.425 --> 49:21.626
Beer for the road?

49:25.096 --> 49:26.297
I'll take two.

49:31.036 --> 49:33.038
I can't take money
from a dead girl.

49:35.873 --> 49:39.710
Where you live isn't
any different from here.

49:41.712 --> 49:43.548
All towns can't
be like this one.

49:46.951 --> 49:48.219
No towns are
like this one.

51:02.527 --> 51:03.961
I like your singing.

51:08.399 --> 51:10.235
How do you know my family?

51:11.469 --> 51:12.970
Never could get a
one night stand.

51:12.970 --> 51:14.405
They always come back.

51:16.874 --> 51:18.075
Just kiddin'.

51:19.644 --> 51:21.479
That is why they
call me the Charmer.

51:23.214 --> 51:24.415
Okay?

51:26.217 --> 51:28.219
'Cause when I was 14,

51:28.653 --> 51:31.656
I got in trouble for seducing
all my female teachers.

51:34.492 --> 51:36.494
Got sent to the
principal's office.

51:38.163 --> 51:39.697
And the principal
was a foxy female

51:39.730 --> 51:41.166
in the brink of menopause.

51:43.067 --> 51:45.503
Nine months later we had
a beautiful baby girl.

51:47.738 --> 51:49.174
It's my superpower.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.942
And you and I are
both helpless to it.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.413
And what's between us
is bigger anyways.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.847
It's historical.

51:59.284 --> 52:02.119
What do you
mean historic?

52:03.288 --> 52:05.089
We're like pit-bull litter-mates

52:05.122 --> 52:07.792
just finding each
other years later,

52:07.858 --> 52:09.860
lickin' each other's faces,

52:10.761 --> 52:12.763
smellin' each other's asses.

52:14.532 --> 52:16.701
How did you meet my mama?

52:18.636 --> 52:21.872
Do you know that we
have memory in our blood?

52:23.608 --> 52:25.210
Blood memory they call it.

52:26.377 --> 52:27.812
How do you know my family?

52:29.214 --> 52:30.381
Hmm?

52:34.885 --> 52:36.053
Answer me!

52:37.121 --> 52:38.088
How?

52:38.122 --> 52:39.557
Do you know what you need?

52:40.558 --> 52:42.427
What you need is a man.

52:42.460 --> 52:43.728
That's why you're
behaving this way.

52:43.728 --> 52:45.230
I mean, you think that
you need to be a fighter,

52:45.230 --> 52:47.298
but you just need a
man to fight for you.

52:48.966 --> 52:51.969
Your daddy should've fought
for you and he didn't.

52:53.338 --> 52:54.739
Well I would fight for you.

52:56.341 --> 52:59.344
Oh, I would stop at
nothing to fight for you.

53:01.746 --> 53:03.147
You miss your daddy?

53:05.516 --> 53:06.917
I miss my mom too.

53:31.776 --> 53:32.943
Oh shit!

55:05.436 --> 55:06.637
What did you do?

55:43.474 --> 55:45.075
You piece of shit.

57:33.851 --> 57:35.686
Shhhh.

58:00.377 --> 58:02.379
So you're the other woman.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.049
What?

58:09.386 --> 58:12.222
There's only one man who
was never ugly with me.

58:15.560 --> 58:17.562
But he was hung up
on another woman.

58:19.129 --> 58:20.330
You.

58:23.568 --> 58:25.570
You ain't even makin' sense.

58:26.637 --> 58:28.072
Your daddy.

58:33.143 --> 58:34.612
What'd you know
about my daddy?

58:37.414 --> 58:38.816
I know one thing
about him.

58:39.917 --> 58:43.187
You were the only
love of his life.

58:47.925 --> 58:49.359
Why would you say that?

58:50.427 --> 58:51.662
Yeah, yeah, right.

58:53.163 --> 58:55.766
I don't know why your
daddy cared for you so much.

58:58.502 --> 59:00.605
I never had nothin'
like that to care for.

59:02.006 --> 59:03.207
You don't know shit.

59:03.540 --> 59:05.810
You don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

59:05.843 --> 59:08.278
You don't know nothin'
about what daddy did to me,

59:08.278 --> 59:09.714
what he did to Mama.

59:11.115 --> 59:13.550
Kicked us to the
curb when I was six.

59:14.952 --> 59:17.054
And kicked Mama's
back so bad,

59:17.121 --> 59:19.523
she still can
barely even walk.

59:20.625 --> 59:21.826
And Mama couldn't work,

59:21.926 --> 59:23.861
so she had to rely on all
hese different men to feed us,t

59:23.894 --> 59:25.129
and these men, you-

59:29.533 --> 59:31.969
So you say Daddy
loved me so much.

59:33.303 --> 59:34.972
If he loved me so much,

59:37.574 --> 59:39.209
then where the hell was he?

59:48.485 --> 59:50.154
I'm sorry that
happened to you.

59:51.488 --> 59:54.491
ook, I don't know what happenedL
between him and your mom,

59:55.926 --> 59:57.261
but you obviously
don't know anything

59:57.327 --> 59:58.729
about what he did after.

59:59.930 --> 1:00:02.532
Damned fool driving
over an hour to work,

1:00:02.566 --> 1:00:05.836
livin' on canned soup and six
packs to save money for you,

1:00:07.104 --> 1:00:09.606
wanted to buy you out
of the life you were in.

1:00:09.674 --> 1:00:11.575
"The Cycle" he called it.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:15.746
Nights and Sundays he's
out lookin' for you.

1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:17.347
Writin' letters all over.

1:00:18.448 --> 1:00:21.618
Called every shit place that
knows anything about anything.

1:00:23.353 --> 1:00:25.022
And no one knew a thing.

1:00:27.257 --> 1:00:29.593
Na uh, no, he
sent that letter

1:00:29.626 --> 1:00:31.862
because he wanted to
come back and hurt Mama.

1:00:33.030 --> 1:00:35.032
So I was gonna
hurt him first.

1:00:36.867 --> 1:00:38.869
And that's why I came
here to kill him.

1:00:40.938 --> 1:00:42.272
You came to kill him?

1:00:42.306 --> 1:00:43.540
Yeah.

1:00:45.209 --> 1:00:46.376
What?

1:00:47.377 --> 1:00:48.813
Why you think that's funny?

1:00:49.613 --> 1:00:50.815
It's perfect.

1:00:51.716 --> 1:00:53.050
Mission accomplished.

1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.221
What are you talkin' about?

1:00:58.288 --> 1:01:00.657
You killed your daddy
and you don't even know it.

1:01:02.893 --> 1:01:05.162
Your daddy's love for
you is what killed him.

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:08.766
The money your daddy
saved for you,

1:01:08.799 --> 1:01:11.068
that's what they
killed him for.

1:01:11.068 --> 1:01:13.503
That's why your
uncles killed him.

1:01:13.570 --> 1:01:14.739
My uncles?

1:01:18.175 --> 1:01:19.476
You're-

1:01:19.509 --> 1:01:20.745
you're sayin'

1:01:21.812 --> 1:01:24.815
Sheriff and fuckface are-are
Daddy's brothers?

1:01:26.150 --> 1:01:28.152
They're your mom's brothers.

1:01:31.588 --> 1:01:32.823
Mama's brothers?

1:01:35.492 --> 1:01:36.927
You don't know much, huh?

1:01:38.929 --> 1:01:40.097
You're just-

1:01:40.264 --> 1:01:41.866
you're just talkin'
out of your ass, lady.

1:01:41.932 --> 1:01:44.301
I-I-I-I've heard stories
about Mama's brothers.

1:01:44.334 --> 1:01:45.770
And those bitches
ain't them.

1:01:46.336 --> 1:01:47.838
Your daddy was
a real fuck up

1:01:47.872 --> 1:01:49.439
but he would never
hurt a lady.

1:01:50.775 --> 1:01:54.444
No, all he wanted was to
do something nice for you.

1:02:00.717 --> 1:02:02.019
So this letter

1:02:04.288 --> 1:02:07.124
said Daddy wanted to give
me a bunch of money?

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:09.293
Really.

1:02:11.962 --> 1:02:13.864
I told him not to
send that letter.

1:02:15.299 --> 1:02:16.533
Bullshit.

1:02:17.802 --> 1:02:19.469
Maybe it's all
just bar talk.

1:02:19.469 --> 1:02:21.671
Maybe he never did
hide any money.

1:02:21.705 --> 1:02:23.207
Nobody ever found it, right?

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:24.408
Maybe you should
just go home now.

1:02:24.474 --> 1:02:25.409
Forget all about what-

1:02:25.475 --> 1:02:27.077
What, why are you
just fillin' my head

1:02:27.144 --> 1:02:28.712
with all these like lies,

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:31.215
like Daddy savin'
up money for me?

1:02:31.248 --> 1:02:32.416
Bullshit!

1:02:32.482 --> 1:02:34.651
And them being my uncles?

1:02:36.486 --> 1:02:37.922
They're my uncles?

1:02:37.988 --> 1:02:39.056
Yup.

1:02:39.089 --> 1:02:40.190
Bullshit.

1:02:40.224 --> 1:02:41.191
Bullshit!

1:02:41.225 --> 1:02:42.659
Betty, you home?

1:02:43.928 --> 1:02:45.162
Get in here.

1:02:46.230 --> 1:02:47.865
Get in here, go.

1:02:47.898 --> 1:02:48.866
Are you crazy?

1:02:52.336 --> 1:02:53.503
Trust me.

1:02:57.341 --> 1:02:58.575
Ow.

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:07.017
Where'd she go, Betty?

1:03:07.852 --> 1:03:10.855
Bitch stole my knives
and ran out the back.

1:03:18.863 --> 1:03:20.530
She knows where
the money is.

1:03:31.375 --> 1:03:32.376
If the money's for her

1:03:32.376 --> 1:03:34.378
he'd hide it
somewhere she knows.

1:03:54.231 --> 1:03:56.233
You need to get
outta town now.

1:04:06.676 --> 1:04:07.912
Okay.

1:04:07.978 --> 1:04:09.179
Before you go,

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:12.249
your daddy carried
this around.

1:04:14.318 --> 1:04:17.087
I stole it a couple of weeks
ago 'cause I was jealous.

1:04:19.023 --> 1:04:21.425
He drove himself
crazy looking for it.

1:04:37.774 --> 1:04:39.209
Come on, Mama.

1:04:52.022 --> 1:04:53.857
Get away, I want Mommy.

1:04:54.124 --> 1:04:56.126
I'm trying to
be a good dad,

1:04:56.126 --> 1:04:57.861
but you're making
it really difficult.

1:04:57.894 --> 1:04:59.296
Mommy says you're shit.

1:05:00.564 --> 1:05:01.966
Leave me alone!

1:05:02.967 --> 1:05:04.801
Can you please
just talk to me?

1:06:25.482 --> 1:06:26.716
Oh shit.

1:07:10.427 --> 1:07:12.028
I can hear your
heart beating.

1:07:20.437 --> 1:07:22.872
You know, I know what
you come from, girl.

1:07:24.608 --> 1:07:28.778
Just like you, I saw the face
of my old man at the end too,

1:07:28.778 --> 1:07:30.447
the fear on his face.

1:07:32.449 --> 1:07:34.451
They always get
theirs in the end.

1:07:36.186 --> 1:07:37.787
Then we're left behind.

1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:45.195
That's why you
are what you are.

1:07:46.062 --> 1:07:47.297
I understand.

1:07:47.564 --> 1:07:49.966
I understand you gotta
do what you gotta do.

1:07:54.138 --> 1:07:55.805
So what are you gonna do?

1:08:11.321 --> 1:08:12.756
Where ya goin'?

1:08:20.164 --> 1:08:21.398
You know, sweetheart,

1:08:22.499 --> 1:08:24.834
we aren't in control
of a goddamned thing.

1:08:27.171 --> 1:08:28.405
It's the man upstairs.

1:08:30.006 --> 1:08:31.241
But I guess, uh,

1:08:31.275 --> 1:08:34.278
he ain't lookin' down
on the two of us.

1:08:45.855 --> 1:08:47.424
Back when I had religion,

1:08:48.692 --> 1:08:50.093
and I was a preacher,

1:08:51.461 --> 1:08:54.464
I built that goddamn church
with my own bare hands.

1:08:56.200 --> 1:08:58.202
I married your mommy
and daddy there.

1:08:59.203 --> 1:09:02.306
It's when your momma was
done with your daddy,

1:09:02.372 --> 1:09:03.607
she didn't want
that church alive.

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:06.376
With all this crazy shit,

1:09:06.376 --> 1:09:08.278
made up all these lies.

1:09:10.714 --> 1:09:13.217
It hurt my name,
hurt my reputation.

1:09:20.290 --> 1:09:21.958
So where's the money,
sweetheart?

1:09:32.302 --> 1:09:33.337
I swear.

1:09:33.403 --> 1:09:34.838
I really don't
know where it is.

1:09:34.904 --> 1:09:36.306
You better find
this goddamn money

1:09:36.340 --> 1:09:37.974
before your mama gets here.

1:09:38.842 --> 1:09:40.477
Why is Mama coming here?

1:09:47.183 --> 1:09:48.752
So you're my uncle?

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:52.188
I'm sorry I missed
all your birthdays.

1:09:59.329 --> 1:10:00.497
Ah!

1:11:23.413 --> 1:11:26.350
You are your
mama's daughter.

1:12:06.890 --> 1:12:08.157
Come on, come on.

1:12:11.461 --> 1:12:12.462
Come on.

1:12:57.674 --> 1:12:58.875
Daddy.

1:13:04.013 --> 1:13:05.214
I'm sorry.

1:13:56.399 --> 1:13:57.834
What'd you do, baby?

1:13:59.603 --> 1:14:01.004
What'd you do, Mama?

1:14:05.341 --> 1:14:06.743
I see you found it.

1:14:09.078 --> 1:14:10.514
Where is it, Mama?

1:14:12.115 --> 1:14:13.349
Right there.

1:14:14.017 --> 1:14:16.953
Not the money,
the letter, Mama.

1:14:17.020 --> 1:14:18.888
The one Daddy
wrote for me,

1:14:18.922 --> 1:14:21.090
and not-not that
bullshit fantasy letter

1:14:21.124 --> 1:14:22.258
that you made
up in your head

1:14:22.291 --> 1:14:24.460
about him comin' down
there and hurtin' you.

1:14:26.596 --> 1:14:27.797
The real one.

1:14:29.533 --> 1:14:31.467
The one about him
looking for me.

1:14:32.702 --> 1:14:36.573
About this stack of cash
he had hidden away for me.

1:14:36.606 --> 1:14:39.543
ou know, the one you sent yourY
darlin' old brothers out here

1:14:39.543 --> 1:14:41.044
to just pay him a visit.

1:14:42.111 --> 1:14:43.112
That letter, Mama.

1:14:43.146 --> 1:14:45.148
I want to read that letter.

1:14:49.218 --> 1:14:50.654
I left it at home.

1:14:55.058 --> 1:14:57.060
What really happened
to your back?

1:14:58.127 --> 1:14:59.395
You know all about it.

1:14:59.395 --> 1:15:00.930
Your daddy kicked
us to the curb and-

1:15:00.964 --> 1:15:02.065
The truth, Mama!

1:15:02.065 --> 1:15:03.600
He kicked me in the back!

1:15:03.633 --> 1:15:05.234
Oh, I know the truth!

1:15:06.335 --> 1:15:09.739
You fell out of the back of
your brother's pickup truck,

1:15:09.739 --> 1:15:13.577
because you were a drunk,
stupid little girl.

1:15:14.578 --> 1:15:17.413
You raised me on lies.

1:15:19.248 --> 1:15:23.452
My whole life is one big
old thing of bullshit

1:15:23.486 --> 1:15:26.022
and so is Daddy's life!

1:15:26.089 --> 1:15:28.291
Now you shouldn't have
done that to us, Mama.

1:15:28.324 --> 1:15:29.525
Us?

1:15:30.694 --> 1:15:31.928
You knew.

1:15:33.997 --> 1:15:36.833
So your daddy wanted
to give you some money.

1:15:36.866 --> 1:15:38.201
So what?

1:15:38.267 --> 1:15:40.804
He should've been givin' me
that money all these years,

1:15:40.837 --> 1:15:42.939
so I could buy you
books and shit!

1:15:45.875 --> 1:15:49.879
Oh, you think it means
he loves you, don't you?

1:15:52.448 --> 1:15:54.450
You don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

1:15:55.785 --> 1:15:58.221
You're just a
blind stupid girl

1:15:58.287 --> 1:16:00.289
who wants her
daddy's love so bad

1:16:00.289 --> 1:16:02.458
she's willing to buy
a bunch of horse shit.

1:16:04.728 --> 1:16:07.230
Who went without so you
could have your Fruit Loops

1:16:07.296 --> 1:16:11.400
and your spaghetti and
your fuckin' chicken thighs?

1:16:11.467 --> 1:16:14.370
Who took care of the boys who
always threw rocks at you?

1:16:14.403 --> 1:16:17.140
Who visited you in
juvie every week?

1:16:18.241 --> 1:16:19.643
Was it your daddy?

1:16:20.309 --> 1:16:21.745
He show up?

1:16:22.979 --> 1:16:24.380
It was your mama!

1:16:29.653 --> 1:16:31.487
But I gave my
whole life to you.

1:16:33.056 --> 1:16:34.758
I gave you everything.

1:16:37.226 --> 1:16:39.595
And yet you love him more.

1:16:52.175 --> 1:16:53.843
Let's go home, baby.

1:16:56.112 --> 1:16:57.747
I don't care
about the money.

1:16:59.615 --> 1:17:01.017
We can just split it.

1:17:07.857 --> 1:17:09.292
Go look at him, Mama.

1:17:10.459 --> 1:17:11.861
He's in the garage.

1:17:17.533 --> 1:17:18.768
I'd rather not.

1:17:23.206 --> 1:17:24.240
You're right
about one thing.

1:17:24.273 --> 1:17:26.642
Oh, you are right
about one thing.

1:17:29.378 --> 1:17:34.383
I have been a blind,
stupid girl, Mama,

1:17:37.887 --> 1:17:40.223
Because you put
all this together,

1:17:40.223 --> 1:17:43.226
didn't you, Mama, huh?

1:17:43.793 --> 1:17:45.228
And you knew

1:17:45.995 --> 1:17:49.432
my Daddy and your brothers
would destroy each other,

1:17:49.465 --> 1:17:52.468
and then you could come over
here and pick up all the money.

1:17:55.138 --> 1:17:57.741
Daddy's dead
'cause of you.

1:17:59.408 --> 1:18:01.244
You'd never
hurt your mama.

1:18:09.518 --> 1:18:13.089
I just need to know
one thing, Mama.

1:18:17.861 --> 1:18:22.198
Why'd you keep him from me
for all these years, Mama?

1:18:23.599 --> 1:18:24.600
You're gonna kill me.

1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:26.035
Why should I tell you?

1:18:29.172 --> 1:18:31.174
Because I need to know, Mama!

1:18:31.207 --> 1:18:34.210
I need to know the truth,
goddammit, please!

1:18:40.884 --> 1:18:42.285
Because he cheated on me.

1:18:50.293 --> 1:18:51.727
At least I thought he did.

1:19:02.071 --> 1:19:03.306
That's all?

1:19:04.540 --> 1:19:06.209
My family holds a grudge.

1:19:09.478 --> 1:19:10.713
Look at you.

1:19:13.216 --> 1:19:14.884
You're about to
kill your mother.

1:19:39.909 --> 1:19:42.411
My parents have been
dead for decades,

1:19:43.279 --> 1:19:45.281
but they're still
fighting in my head.

1:19:52.856 --> 1:19:54.858
Your daddy and I are
fighting in yours.

1:20:01.965 --> 1:20:04.367
No, you're not fighting
in my head no more, Mama.

1:20:09.605 --> 1:20:11.474
I'll see you at home?

1:21:38.461 --> 1:21:39.963
I don't know, Daddy.

1:21:41.297 --> 1:21:42.698
I can't live here.

1:21:44.968 --> 1:21:46.635
And I can't go home either.

1:22:23.172 --> 1:22:24.340
Shots?

1:22:25.841 --> 1:22:27.910
No, I'm-I'm good.

1:22:34.850 --> 1:22:36.285
What are you having?

1:22:36.852 --> 1:22:38.021
Coffee.

1:22:47.530 --> 1:22:49.532
You know what your
dad once said to me?

1:22:51.300 --> 1:22:56.305
The only real
revenge is living a good life.

1:23:01.044 --> 1:23:02.478
I didn't listen to him.

1:23:19.728 --> 1:23:21.564
Campaign contributions.

1:23:22.398 --> 1:23:26.735
I, uh, I think there's an
opening for a new sheriff.

1:24:55.924 --> 1:24:57.926
We can only
afford one seat.

1:24:57.993 --> 1:24:59.395
She can sit on my lap.

1:25:16.111 --> 1:25:17.246
I took your crazy advice.

1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:19.282
You're probably gonna tell
me I'm doin' it all wrong.

1:25:24.187 --> 1:25:26.955
This girl's gonna have
her own bedroom,

1:25:27.022 --> 1:25:28.424
at least her own bed.

1:25:28.857 --> 1:25:30.859
Gonna work some shit job,
I don't care.

1:25:32.361 --> 1:25:34.029
Just gotta get her
away from here.

1:25:36.031 --> 1:25:37.266
You want one?

1:25:39.868 --> 1:25:41.270
I got an extra one for her.

1:25:43.306 --> 1:25:44.540
It's extra.

1:26:10.733 --> 1:26:12.668
Thank you.
