WEBVTT

00:00.628 --> 00:04.378
<i>Hot in Cleveland is recorded in
front of a live studio audience.</i>

00:05.813 --> 00:08.514
We're still in a rented
house in Ohio, right?

00:08.549 --> 00:09.531
Yep.

00:09.566 --> 00:13.004
So last night, a guy 15
years younger than me

00:13.039 --> 00:15.997
really did give me his phone number?

00:16.032 --> 00:18.342
Oh, it's the magic of Cleveland, Joy.

00:18.377 --> 00:22.179
All the most beautiful people in the
world move to L.A. to become stars,

00:22.214 --> 00:24.890
Leaving behind in their
wake beauty voids

00:24.950 --> 00:26.934
For the rest of us to fill.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.320
I've never dated younger.

00:30.626 --> 00:32.671
I think I'm gonna give it a try.

00:32.706 --> 00:33.906
It's exciting.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.341
It's disgusting.

00:37.444 --> 00:41.511
You're too old and creaky
To be robbing the cradle.

00:41.820 --> 00:42.920
I'm old?

00:42.955 --> 00:45.581
Was Ohio even a state
when you were born?

00:47.034 --> 00:49.203
They were talking about it.

00:50.985 --> 00:53.249
Oh! I've run out of cotton balls.

00:53.309 --> 00:55.727
Elka, where's the nearest Neiman Marcus?

00:55.762 --> 00:57.460
Chicago.

00:59.063 --> 01:02.064
But there's a big n easy
just down the street.

01:02.820 --> 01:04.001
This outfit--

01:04.037 --> 01:05.536
3 for $10.

01:07.454 --> 01:09.204
Incentive indeed.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.114
Although my agent has said

01:11.149 --> 01:14.861
that having played Honor st.
Raven for the past 27 years.

01:14.896 --> 01:18.979
I am some more typecast as a
woman of taste and refinement.

01:19.415 --> 01:22.312
Perhaps I could better
portray a common person

01:22.353 --> 01:25.484
If I observe them in
their natural habitat.

01:27.802 --> 01:30.984
Morning. How everyone sleep? Me? Rock.

01:31.025 --> 01:32.930
And what a beautiful Ohio morning.

01:32.965 --> 01:34.855
Birds are chirping. People are smiling.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.586
Someone actually said "hiya" to me...

01:38.809 --> 01:40.289
With the "ya."

01:42.466 --> 01:46.142
Who put a quarter in that one?

01:46.202 --> 01:47.702
Oh, I have big news.

01:47.749 --> 01:49.383
I'm extending my lease here,

01:49.418 --> 01:52.052
And I'm thinking of putting my
house in L.A. On the market.

01:52.087 --> 01:54.287
Wow, Melanie, you're really
going through with this?

01:54.322 --> 01:57.156
Well, how are you gonna get your Botox?

01:57.191 --> 01:59.041
That's your first question?

02:00.294 --> 02:02.657
I'll find a doctor here.

02:02.692 --> 02:03.992
Cleveland Botox?

02:04.030 --> 02:06.280
Good God, woman, are you an animal?

02:08.199 --> 02:09.632
Well, I'm glad you're staying.

02:09.692 --> 02:12.003
Well, thank you, miss belle of the bar.

02:12.206 --> 02:13.422
Oh, stop.

02:14.994 --> 02:17.285
How many guys gave you
their number last night?

02:18.384 --> 02:20.073
One or two.

02:24.422 --> 02:28.659
I had to wait till I was 88
To find out I have game.

02:30.389 --> 02:31.594
What do you want for breakfast?

02:31.629 --> 02:34.196
- Oh, you cook?
- And give advice.

02:34.231 --> 02:36.143
Like drama on entourage.

02:37.968 --> 02:39.233
You watch entourage?

02:39.268 --> 02:43.203
You seem more like a weeds viewer to me.

02:44.008 --> 02:47.373
That show is so unrealistic.

02:48.619 --> 02:50.075
I'll have egg whites, please.

02:50.110 --> 02:52.144
Half a grapefruit, sprinkle of splenda.

02:52.179 --> 02:54.644
Steel-cut oats with seasonal berries.

02:54.745 --> 02:57.179
Pancakes and bacon, coming up.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.964 --> 03:10.735
I cannot believe that all of these
great furniture was in storage.

03:10.785 --> 03:12.701
I mean, I love the table,
I love the chairs,

03:12.802 --> 03:15.065
I love the sofa. I really love the rugs.

03:15.100 --> 03:17.334
I might not even send
for my stuff in L.A.

03:17.369 --> 03:19.913
Oh, boy, if this furniture
could talk, huh?

03:20.278 --> 03:22.508
It would be a welcome relief.

03:26.420 --> 03:29.378
I'm sorry, I just... I got a little,
you know, carried away.

03:29.413 --> 03:31.979
So have you decided
which guy to call yet?

03:32.014 --> 03:33.951
- No.
- Really?

03:33.986 --> 03:35.580
Well, you know,
why don't let me help you?

03:35.620 --> 03:38.380
Just tell me a little bit about them.

03:38.415 --> 03:41.012
Well, Arthur can drive at night.

03:45.053 --> 03:48.255
And Larry has that nice
full ring of hair.

03:51.552 --> 03:54.693
Sal has both original hips,

03:54.887 --> 03:57.230
Which is sexy as hell.

03:58.203 --> 04:01.712
Well, it sounds to me like you can't
go wrong, So just pick one and call.

04:01.753 --> 04:03.151
Uh, right.

04:04.068 --> 04:05.525
Maybe tomorrow.

04:06.254 --> 04:08.369
Elka, what's going on?

04:08.404 --> 04:11.818
Oh, Melanie, I don't
know how to call a man.

04:11.853 --> 04:13.438
Ok, I'm gonna help you.

04:13.473 --> 04:15.673
Let's just pretend, all right?
We'll practice.

04:15.708 --> 04:17.406
Which one of these do you want me to be?

04:17.442 --> 04:20.559
- Larry with the hair.
- Okay.

04:20.810 --> 04:23.210
I'm Larry. You call me.

04:23.731 --> 04:24.745
Ring, ring.

04:24.780 --> 04:27.180
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

04:28.816 --> 04:32.584
I mean, nobody over 80
answers on the first ring.

04:32.619 --> 04:34.886
Well, yeah, okay.

04:34.921 --> 04:37.555
Sorry, sorry, my bad.
Um, let's try this again.

04:37.590 --> 04:39.431
Ring, ring.

04:39.491 --> 04:41.125
Ring, ring.

04:41.841 --> 04:43.860
Ring, ring.

04:43.962 --> 04:45.862
Ring, ring.

04:46.513 --> 04:47.574
Ring, ring.

04:47.594 --> 04:50.132
- Hello?
- I can't do this.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.300
Oh, Elka.

04:52.653 --> 04:54.133
How do I look?

04:54.194 --> 04:57.638
Like you stepped out of a painting...

04:57.673 --> 04:59.440
Of hookers.

05:02.395 --> 05:05.474
Do not pay attention to her.
Joy, you look absolutely gorgeous.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.746
Are you sure? Not too "cougary"?

05:07.781 --> 05:10.504
Oh, God, I hate that bloody word.

05:10.592 --> 05:12.525
But that's what I am, aren't I?

05:12.560 --> 05:13.926
And I'm the worst kind of cougar--

05:13.961 --> 05:15.561
A self-hating cougar.
Maybe I should call and cancel.

05:15.596 --> 05:17.863
Stop acting so ridiculous.

05:17.898 --> 05:20.632
But what if he makes
references I don't understand.

05:20.667 --> 05:21.834
Look, if you say something wrong,

05:21.869 --> 05:23.468
You can always fall
back on being british.

05:23.503 --> 05:24.836
You know, you could say, um,

05:24.871 --> 05:26.538
that's what we calls it

05:26.573 --> 05:28.066
In london.

05:30.665 --> 05:31.407
Okay, I'll go,

05:31.442 --> 05:34.135
But only because I'm terrified
you'll do that again.

05:35.412 --> 05:36.542
Oh, can I help you?

05:36.577 --> 05:38.109
It's me. Give me a hand.

05:38.144 --> 05:40.987
- Can't. I'm leaving on my date.
- Oh, what are you wearing?

05:41.027 --> 05:43.414
That thing that I wore to that thing
Where that guy thought I was that model.

05:43.449 --> 05:44.781
Mm. Good choice.

05:44.816 --> 05:48.036
Just remember what it
does when you sit down.

05:49.953 --> 05:51.319
Oh, my God.

05:51.354 --> 05:53.287
What an ordeal. So many people.

05:53.322 --> 05:56.890
Although I got to hand it to them,
no matters how big you are

05:56.925 --> 06:00.859
In Cleveland, everybody seems to think
That they can pull off wearing shorts.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.596
So what's with all the stuff?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.664
Oh, you can't leave a
big n easy with less.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.965
You know, everywhere you turn,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.867
They're offering a lifetime
supply of something

06:09.902 --> 06:10.868
For a pittance.

06:11.661 --> 06:13.837
- So you got all this for that?
- I know.

06:13.872 --> 06:19.275
I could have bought out the entire store
For what I spent last month on vermouth.

06:19.310 --> 06:21.277
Oh, my God, vermouth.
I forgot the vermouth.

06:21.312 --> 06:22.545
I got to go.

06:22.580 --> 06:23.912
Wait, wait, it's still open?

06:23.947 --> 06:25.347
Oh, yeah, they never close.

06:25.382 --> 06:28.463
Oh, no, they welcome in all
people anytime, day or night.

06:28.498 --> 06:29.952
It's like hell.

06:33.737 --> 06:35.352
You know, my favorite is the one

06:35.387 --> 06:37.371
- Where jan got the wig.
- Mm.

06:37.432 --> 06:38.749
An excellent choice.

06:38.823 --> 06:42.792
But for me, it has to be where
Marsha stalked Davy Jones.

06:42.827 --> 06:44.693
I love all those old reruns.

06:44.728 --> 06:46.895
Yeah...

06:46.930 --> 06:48.680
Reruns.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.635
And I know I said it two minutes ago,
But you are incredibly pretty.

06:56.338 --> 06:57.588
Stop.

06:59.115 --> 07:00.271
But don't stop.

07:01.375 --> 07:04.743
And funny and smart,
And your accent drives me crazy...

07:05.660 --> 07:07.312
In a good way.

07:07.347 --> 07:09.087
You know, I was actually
born in britain.

07:09.148 --> 07:10.180
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:10.215 --> 07:13.115
My birth mom gave me up for adoption

07:13.150 --> 07:14.683
To this American couple.

07:16.140 --> 07:17.255
Really?

07:18.631 --> 07:19.486
Oh, my God!

07:19.521 --> 07:21.988
I think I'm dating my son.

07:25.843 --> 07:29.345
- So he was born in london?
- On the exact same day.

07:29.406 --> 07:31.630
And year. I made him say it,
like, three times.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.125
- Wow, that is a huge coincidence.
- No kidding.

07:34.647 --> 07:35.780
So what did you say to him?

07:35.815 --> 07:37.571
Oh, I made up some lame excuse

07:37.606 --> 07:39.925
and basically bolted out of there.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.637
But up until the time I found
that I might be his mother

07:42.718 --> 07:45.105
He was the best date I've had in years.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.858
Saw the light on. What's up?

07:50.746 --> 07:52.854
Oh, go ahead.

07:53.329 --> 07:56.130
When joy was a teenager,
she got pregnant.

07:56.364 --> 07:57.966
I'm not surprised.

08:01.635 --> 08:04.169
And now she thinks she
might be dating her son.

08:04.204 --> 08:06.499
Still not surprised.

08:07.775 --> 08:09.894
- You sleeping with him?
- No!

08:12.479 --> 08:15.324
Wait. You told me you
never had children.

08:15.405 --> 08:17.336
Because that's what I tell people.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.450
I've never raised the child.

08:19.485 --> 08:22.835
Besides, it's a time in my
life I prefer to keep buried.

08:28.392 --> 08:30.793
Oh, it's him asking if I'm okay.

08:31.302 --> 08:35.528
Oh. What a sweet boy.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.801
Maybe I should just call
him and tell him the truth.

08:40.836 --> 08:42.568
What, are you out of your mind?

08:42.604 --> 08:44.087
What if he isn't your son?

08:44.123 --> 08:45.388
I might be your mother?

08:45.423 --> 08:46.967
Probably romance toward.

08:48.807 --> 08:51.260
And what's even more horrific
is you'd have to admit

08:51.321 --> 08:52.978
That you're old enough to be his mother.

08:53.013 --> 08:55.184
Now, how old does he think you are?

08:55.219 --> 08:57.548
He said I look 38.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.773
Your son is mentally challenged?

09:07.655 --> 09:10.956
I just wish I had some
proof one way or another.

09:10.991 --> 09:13.792
You know, something like this
Once happened to honor st. Raven.

09:14.315 --> 09:17.228
You remember when I was on
that island studying monkeys?

09:17.263 --> 09:19.579
Yeah, I might have missed that episode.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.234
It was a six months arc.

09:24.052 --> 09:26.336
How long are we gonna do this?
Just tell us what happened.

09:26.371 --> 09:29.938
Well, the scientist I was
working with kidnapped me

09:29.973 --> 09:34.401
And then revealed himself to be
the venezuelan hit man el gato.

09:34.436 --> 09:36.057
That's "the Cat".

09:37.136 --> 09:39.041
Thank you, telemundo.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.918
But what does this have
to do with my situation?

09:46.953 --> 09:49.487
Well, he also claimed to be my father.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.256
Well, that's just stupid.

09:52.291 --> 09:55.092
It was submitted for a humanitas award.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.526
By whom?

09:56.561 --> 09:59.662
It was submitted.

09:59.697 --> 10:02.631
And anyway, I had to prove
that he wasn't my father,

10:02.666 --> 10:05.233
So I had to collect a sample of his DNA.

10:05.268 --> 10:06.567
Now, that's what you should do.

10:06.602 --> 10:08.435
<i>Oh, yeah, like on CSI.</i>

10:08.470 --> 10:10.970
You could get his skin scrapings
from under your fingernails,

10:11.005 --> 10:12.971
You could get a sample of his blood,

10:13.006 --> 10:15.840
Or you could swab the inside
of his cheek with a q-tip.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.509
All very natural dating activities.

10:20.278 --> 10:22.211
But, joy, you need to know.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.614
I mean, is he your sweet baby boy

10:24.649 --> 10:27.616
Or your dirty, sexy, hot boyfriend?

10:27.651 --> 10:29.644
And either way, win-win.

10:30.954 --> 10:33.388
I can't believe I'm
actually saying this,

10:33.766 --> 10:36.624
But how did honor st.
Raven get el gato's DNA?

10:37.218 --> 10:39.360
I plucked a hair from his head

10:39.395 --> 10:41.472
With the follicle still attached.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.093
You get that...

10:43.128 --> 10:44.997
and we can test his DNA.

10:45.032 --> 10:47.433
From our home DNA lab?

10:49.103 --> 10:50.223
No worries.

10:50.264 --> 10:53.122
I've got a lab I've done
some business with.

10:59.211 --> 11:02.478
So, young lady, you ready to
make that phone call again?

11:02.513 --> 11:04.847
Uh, I already did.

11:04.882 --> 11:07.348
Turns out he's not interested.

11:07.383 --> 11:08.449
You're lying.

11:09.019 --> 11:12.268
Okay, fine. I just can't
do it. I'm scared.

11:12.303 --> 11:13.646
Oh, come on.

11:13.646 --> 11:16.456
Who would say no to this?

11:16.491 --> 11:19.304
Well, you got that right.

11:20.328 --> 11:21.961
Come on, call Larry with the hair.

11:21.996 --> 11:23.329
Do you have his number?

11:23.364 --> 11:25.498
I know it by heart.

11:29.681 --> 11:32.705
Hello, this is Elka Ostrovsky

11:32.766 --> 11:36.239
Calling for Larry.

11:36.274 --> 11:37.541
Uh-huh.

11:38.604 --> 11:41.578
Okay, Saturday at 1:00.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.236
I'll be there.

11:43.662 --> 11:46.520
Yay, good for you.
Lucky Larry.

11:46.642 --> 11:49.518
Larry's dead. I'm going to his funeral.

11:51.955 --> 11:55.256
See, it's fate telling me it's too late.

11:55.291 --> 11:58.058
Or this is fate reminding you

11:58.093 --> 12:02.994
That life is short, so you'd better call
The other one before he pops off too.

12:03.998 --> 12:07.506
- Okay, I'll try sal's number.
- Try sal.

12:11.606 --> 12:12.970
He answered right away.

12:13.005 --> 12:15.839
Well, he's got the two good hips.

12:15.874 --> 12:19.242
Sal, this is Elka.

12:19.277 --> 12:21.610
I met you at--

12:21.645 --> 12:23.680
Yes, it's dimples.

12:26.254 --> 12:27.348
I'm nervous.

12:27.383 --> 12:31.085
You're doing great,
and I'm right here if you need me.

12:31.120 --> 12:35.155
I was thinking we might
meet later tonight

12:35.190 --> 12:38.233
For a double date.

12:38.545 --> 12:41.126
- Her name is Melanie.
- What?

12:42.822 --> 12:45.174
You have a younger friend?

12:46.063 --> 12:47.847
Only 85.

12:50.502 --> 12:55.705
Uses a walker,
but grips it very lightly.

13:03.046 --> 13:07.848
Oh, Tyler, what a lovely place.

13:07.883 --> 13:10.517
You're doing very well for yourself...

13:10.552 --> 13:15.287
Although you really should
tidy up before company comes.

13:15.674 --> 13:17.295
What are you, my mother?

13:20.702 --> 13:22.344
Would that be so bad?

13:23.128 --> 13:25.743
- What?
- Nothing. Just joking.

13:31.236 --> 13:33.870
Yeah, you are funny...

13:33.905 --> 13:36.071
And smoking hot.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.341
Oh, well, good genes.

13:39.376 --> 13:41.909
You know, I got to say,
I was a little surprised

13:41.944 --> 13:43.944
When I got your text that
we should skip dinner

13:43.979 --> 13:45.712
And come directly here instead.

13:45.747 --> 13:47.547
Well, it's a little more private.

13:47.886 --> 13:49.142
Awesome.

13:49.832 --> 13:52.306
You know you've the most fabulous hair

13:52.428 --> 13:55.185
so thick and fluent.

13:55.455 --> 13:58.213
- Yeah, it's just like yours.
- Yeah, I noticed that.

14:01.161 --> 14:04.761
I just want to reach in and grab hold...

14:04.796 --> 14:06.663
And grab harder.

14:06.698 --> 14:07.948
Yeah.

14:08.864 --> 14:10.586
Oh, God!

14:10.668 --> 14:12.330
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

14:12.411 --> 14:13.992
Yeah, I'm fine. Really.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.437
Oh, no, you're bleeding.

14:16.472 --> 14:19.624
Oh, you're bleeding!

14:20.542 --> 14:22.776
I'll just go clean up. It's nothing.

14:22.811 --> 14:24.244
No, no, no, wait. I have tissues.

14:24.279 --> 14:26.045
Lots and lots of tissues.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.515
My friend Victoria buys them in bulk.

14:30.854 --> 14:32.713
There. That should be enough.

14:32.748 --> 14:34.947
I mean, that's better.

14:35.994 --> 14:38.751
You know, I'd really prefer
white wine if you have it.

14:39.191 --> 14:40.690
Oh, okay.

14:40.725 --> 14:42.813
Coming right up.

14:46.130 --> 14:48.363
Any particular kind of--

14:48.398 --> 14:50.665
What are you doing?

14:50.700 --> 14:53.301
Oh, nothing. It's just a baggie.

14:53.336 --> 14:56.670
My friend Victoria gets
those by the bulk too.

14:56.705 --> 15:00.006
She's nuts, that woman...

15:00.041 --> 15:02.876
Crazy, crazy, crazy Victoria.

15:06.262 --> 15:08.571
Why are you collecting my blood?

15:08.606 --> 15:10.607
Oh, well, you know,

15:10.782 --> 15:13.441
Collecting blood is all the rage now.

15:13.476 --> 15:17.265
<i>True blood, Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse.</i>

15:17.427 --> 15:18.522
I get it.

15:20.062 --> 15:22.393
So, what are you... a vampire?

15:22.427 --> 15:25.123
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:25.204 --> 15:26.886
I don't want to suck your blood.

15:26.947 --> 15:30.790
I just want to take it home with me.

15:35.661 --> 15:39.663
I was collecting your DNA, because...

15:39.698 --> 15:42.165
I think I might possibly be your mother.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.548
My mother?

15:43.583 --> 15:45.433
It's better that a vampire,

15:47.387 --> 15:49.971
No, it isn't.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.760
Look, I-I gave up a baby for adoption.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.809
I know my birth mother.

15:54.844 --> 15:55.910
You do?

15:55.945 --> 15:58.846
Yeah, I registered on a website.
I met her, like, ten years ago.

16:05.075 --> 16:08.344
Well, that's fantastic news.

16:08.379 --> 16:10.540
I'm not your mother.

16:10.581 --> 16:13.025
We can go back to how we were now.

16:13.060 --> 16:16.295
- Um...
- I'll just let myself out.

16:18.969 --> 16:22.566
Here's to the prettiest
girl in the place.

16:22.601 --> 16:24.835
Well, thank you.

16:34.738 --> 16:38.312
- What?
- It's refreshing!

16:38.347 --> 16:40.314
It's refreshing, isn't it?

16:41.278 --> 16:42.596
Yeah.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.520
Plenty more where that came from.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.926
Hey, what are you doing home so early?

16:55.297 --> 16:56.728
Did you get the hair?

16:57.165 --> 16:58.847
He's not my son...

16:58.908 --> 17:00.469
Or my boyfriend.

17:00.489 --> 17:03.196
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.602
What a night.

17:04.637 --> 17:05.925
Yeah, I'll say.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.810
I was out with a handsy 85-year-old

17:07.872 --> 17:12.143
Who doesn't get "no means no"
because he couldn't hear it.

17:16.086 --> 17:17.546
Where is Victoria?

17:17.750 --> 17:20.717
Big n easy-- where else?

17:20.752 --> 17:23.619
She's really getting
addicted to that place.

17:23.655 --> 17:25.555
- Time for an intervention?
- Yeah, I think so.

17:25.589 --> 17:28.022
How many interventions
have we done for her?

17:28.058 --> 17:30.240
Oh, counting kabbalah and colonics?

17:35.064 --> 17:37.330
Ooh, look, a crowd-- it
must be something good.

17:37.365 --> 17:39.398
Ooh, hope there's more
of that beer-battered...

17:39.433 --> 17:40.733
- What was that?
- Who cares?

17:40.768 --> 17:42.768
It was battered in beer.

17:42.803 --> 17:46.570
Don't worry. No detergent
box will go unsigned.

17:46.605 --> 17:47.705
Victoria?

17:48.548 --> 17:50.778
Joy. Uh, Melanie.

17:50.859 --> 17:52.785
What a surprise.

17:52.805 --> 17:56.012
Would you excuse me for just a moment?

18:01.652 --> 18:03.670
Darling, isn't this
all a little pathetic?

18:03.705 --> 18:06.175
Well, some people might think so.

18:06.195 --> 18:09.460
By the way, how was your
date with your son?

18:11.229 --> 18:12.763
Turns out he's not my son.

18:12.798 --> 18:14.597
- Boyfriend?
- Nope.

18:14.979 --> 18:16.459
- You okay?
- Yep.

18:16.925 --> 18:19.299
Free samples are helping.

18:20.094 --> 18:22.797
So you bought all that stuff Just
as an excuse to come down here?

18:23.616 --> 18:24.528
Yes.

18:24.893 --> 18:27.427
See, I've been feeling very insecure

18:27.487 --> 18:29.769
Ever since the edge of
tomorrow was canceled,

18:30.120 --> 18:32.504
And I-I just didn't want
to burden you two with it.

18:32.539 --> 18:34.573
You talk about it all the time.

18:34.608 --> 18:38.209
Yes, but I've really wanted
to talk about it more.

18:38.666 --> 18:40.711
<i>Attention, big n easy shoppers...</i>

18:40.746 --> 18:43.446
Can you believe that's us?

18:43.481 --> 18:45.414
<i>In the deli department,
we are proud to announce</i>

18:45.449 --> 18:47.416
<i>Our latest yard-long hero sandwich,</i>

18:47.451 --> 18:48.884
<i>The Victoria Chase.</i>

18:48.919 --> 18:50.687
You see, I'm a hero.

18:50.722 --> 18:54.025
Oh, come on. I promised I'd spray on
The first foot of cheese.

18:58.174 --> 19:00.171
Hey, what are you doing?

19:00.206 --> 19:03.307
- You won't approve.
- Tell us.

19:04.443 --> 19:05.909
Googling the ex.

19:06.481 --> 19:10.546
I found a picture of
Anders and Kim in Paris.

19:10.752 --> 19:13.517
Apparently, they were flying
to some competition...

19:13.552 --> 19:16.253
'cause she's a fitness model.

19:17.030 --> 19:21.526
All right, take it from someone who
went searching for validation in bulk.

19:24.823 --> 19:27.823
Sometimes is just best to let things go.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.734
Yeah, you're right. What's past is past.

19:31.241 --> 19:34.545
Still, you can't pretend
it never existed.

19:34.585 --> 19:37.221
Here, let me have that.

19:38.072 --> 19:39.776
Tyler mentioned this website

19:39.811 --> 19:42.579
He used to let his mother
know he was looking for her.

19:42.614 --> 19:47.517
Oh, joy, this is amazing. Are you
really thinking of finding your son?

19:47.552 --> 19:49.052
Maybe.

19:49.220 --> 19:51.119
It's all just a...

19:51.436 --> 19:52.571
A lot.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.497
I can't imagine.

19:54.623 --> 19:57.290
Yes, you can. You're a mother.

19:57.325 --> 20:00.533
Hey, so are you.

20:00.614 --> 20:02.763
Thanks.

20:02.798 --> 20:06.066
Oh, it's just so weird to
think of him out there--

20:06.101 --> 20:08.001
A grown man.

20:08.036 --> 20:10.903
He could be married,
have kids of his own.

20:10.938 --> 20:12.738
I might even have...

20:12.773 --> 20:14.489
Grandkids.

20:15.604 --> 20:19.243
Hey, maybe one of 'em's old
enough for you to date.

20:24.727 --> 20:25.883
Too soon?
