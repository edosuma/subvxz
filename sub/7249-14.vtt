00:02.211 --> 00:04.338
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

00:05.672 --> 00:06.840
Dad!

00:09.635 --> 00:12.137
- I want to marry you.
- You're completely insane!

00:12.221 --> 00:13.222
- Who is he?
- Who?

00:13.305 --> 00:15.307
The boy you ran off to see,
who calls here...

00:15.390 --> 00:17.643
pretending to work for
The Wall Street Journal.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.062
I can be a family man.
I'm responsible now.

00:20.145 --> 00:23.607
Honey, you can't even buy a book
without having your credit card declined.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.484
- Maybe he can change.
- Rory.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.904
Maybe it's different. He did come here
this time. He's never done that.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.657
No boys. Not unless I approve,
and I don't approve.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.741
- How do you know?
- I know!

00:32.824 --> 00:35.869
You're sneaking, you're lying.
Something's wrong with this boy.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.830
- A Volvo sedan? Are you kidding?
- This is a great car.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.583
- For driving to bingo.
- It just seemed like time.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.752
I couldn't keep showing up
for work on my bike.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.295
- Work?
- You've heard of it?

00:45.379 --> 00:47.548
- You go upstairs and calm down!
- Fine!

00:47.631 --> 00:49.258
- Now!
- Fine!

00:50.592 --> 00:52.427
That is not calming down!

00:55.389 --> 00:57.057
I really have to get back.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.600
- To work?
- To someone.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.644
Linda from marketing
got to you, didn't she?

01:00.727 --> 01:01.728
Her name is Sherrie.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.522
- Is it serious?
- We're living together.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.696
My question is, how did that happen?
How was it that suddenly...

01:10.779 --> 01:14.408
everyone was saying, 'music has charms
to sooth the savage beast'...

01:14.491 --> 01:16.451
- when it was written 'breast'?
- I don't know.

01:16.535 --> 01:20.080
- Someone misspoke and it just caught on.
- How do things like that catch on?

01:20.163 --> 01:23.125
- Please, you're driving me crazy.
- Did some guy say it...

01:23.208 --> 01:26.503
at a big rally of some sort
and everyone started saying it that way...

01:26.587 --> 01:28.714
- and it spread from there?
- Yes, exactly.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.383
Now you're just trying to shut me up.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.468
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:33.552 --> 01:34.678
Look.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.138
Empty.

01:36.221 --> 01:39.433
Just one of those weird lulls.
Happens occasionally.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.977
- Can we sit wherever we like?
- Wherever you like.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.771
- Luxury I never dreamed of.
- Where do you want to sit?

01:44.855 --> 01:45.898
I don't know.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.775
How about this table
with its unobstructed westward view...

01:48.859 --> 01:51.111
of the wide cosmopolitan expanse
of Clump Street?

01:51.195 --> 01:53.155
Tempting. Do you know
that on a clear day...

01:53.238 --> 01:56.074
you can see the garbage cans
behind Al's Pancake World?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.410
Or we could sit in the corner,
the mafia table...

01:58.452 --> 02:01.622
so that no one can come up behind you
and whack you with a cannoli.

02:01.705 --> 02:05.083
Whack you with a cannoli? Because he left
the gun and took the cannoli.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.127
You are so my daughter.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.670
Let's sit at the counter.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.632
No, those are not the power seats.

02:11.715 --> 02:15.177
But with no one here, we can sit
at either end and play bagel hockey.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.430
- Bagel hockey.
- Just sit at a table.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.351
You're awfully rude for a guy
who only has two paying customers.

02:22.434 --> 02:26.104
Okay, 3:30 on Friday:
My debate at Chilton, write it down.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.814
- Already written.
- Good.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.776
- You prepared?
- Please. Paris has us beyond prepared.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.570
I know more about
doctor-assisted suicide than I care to.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.947
Cheery topic.

02:34.988 --> 02:35.989
Luke's.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.284
Hold on a second. It's for you.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.412
- What?
- But who knows we're here?

02:42.496 --> 02:45.541
- This morning has been Twilight Zone-y.
- Or Outer Limits-y.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.252
- What?
- Great show, just as eerie, same era...

02:48.335 --> 02:49.962
but no one ever references it.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.215
- I'm sorry, I don't speak geek.
- Yep, stepped right in it.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.675
- Hello?
- Rory?

02:54.758 --> 02:56.718
Lane? How did you know I was here?

02:56.802 --> 03:01.223
Telescope. I've got a clean shot at Luke's.
I saw you and your mom go in.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.308
- Watch it.
- Yeah, duck, Harvey.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.936
Are you still grounded over
that whole Henry thing?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.146
Are you kidding?
The mother of all groundings.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.149
Mom's done everything
but slap a Dr. Dre ankle bracelet on me.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.944
- I'm not even going to school.
- Isn't that illegal?

03:14.027 --> 03:17.155
She talked my teachers into me
being home-schooled for two weeks.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.283
The words 'highly contagious'
were bandied about.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.451
I get five minutes a day
of outside phone time.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.453
Unlimited time
to call the Psalm-A-Day Line.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.748
A big rip-off because Psalm 79
has been on there for three days.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.209
That's not in keeping with
what their name implies...

03:29.293 --> 03:30.919
which is a new Psalm every day...

03:31.003 --> 03:33.046
not the same tired one
from the previous days.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.591
Never heard anyone get so riled up
about psalms before.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.134
My world has become very small.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.595
Okay, I'm dying for news.
Give me some headlines.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.430
I've got a debate coming up...

03:41.513 --> 03:44.016
and Dean's been working
extra hours lately...

03:44.099 --> 03:46.727
saving up for a new motorcycle,
so I hardly see him.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.979
Mom and I haven't done
laundry in three weeks...

03:49.062 --> 03:51.899
but I've begun jumping into
the huge pile of dirty clothes...

03:51.982 --> 03:54.484
as we play our Reader's Digest
World's Famous Polkas CD.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.904
We got it used for 99 cents.
Sorry if that's boring.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.781
You kidding? That's the most stimulation
I've got in a week.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.658
Lane, come down for your snack.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.744
It's tea-and-melba-toast time. Gotta go.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.537
- Don't forget me in my solitude.
- Never.

04:05.621 --> 04:06.622
Bye.

04:08.707 --> 04:09.917
Think fast.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.544
Impressive.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.838
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- What?

04:14.922 --> 04:17.466
- Goalie for the bagel-hockey team.
- And bump Schmitty?

04:17.548 --> 04:20.010
Schmitty's over the hill.
Put him in Cooperstown.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.220
Suit up, kid.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.847
Call me if anyone sane walks in.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:22.489 --> 05:25.284
- There's nothing on.
- There's always something on.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.619
Struck gold.

05:28.412 --> 05:31.123
- Not the two fat ladies again.
- Why not? They're brilliant.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.001
- It's a cooking show and you don't cook.
- That might change.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.335
- Not a chance.
- Probably not.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.963
We've seen all of them five times.
They're all repeats.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.549
Sadly, because one of the fat ladies
met her maker.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.010
- Really? Which one?
- The fat one.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.597
Come on. The one on the motorcycle
or the one in the sidecar?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.516
See? It's fun just talking
about the two fat ladies.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.311
Can't we find
other really fat people to watch?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.938
That sounded really insensitive.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.149
Paris.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.234
- Can I come in?
- I guess.

06:04.615 --> 06:07.117
You couldn't be wondering
what I'm doing here.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.660
- I couldn't?
- The debate's Friday.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.455
- We need more preparation.
- More preparation?

06:11.538 --> 06:14.917
No two people know more
about assisted suicide than the two of us.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.752
Kevorkian called today for a few tips.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.963
There's issues of presentation
that need to be addressed.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.674
- Presentation?
- I was listening to the CD and cassettes...

06:22.758 --> 06:26.678
I made of our mock debates and I realized
that you were not talking fast enough.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.264
- What?
- You're only doing 135 WPM.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.016
- WPM?
- 'Words per minute. '

06:31.058 --> 06:32.518
- Of course.
- That's slow.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.770
- That's not slow.
- It's Jimmy Bob slow.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.523
- I talk normally.
- For the average Willie Nelson roadie...

06:37.564 --> 06:39.024
not for a winning debate member.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.444
As a comparison,
I speak an average of 178 WPM.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.029
Word speed isn't everything.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.699
Sometimes I will add a dramatic pause
to prove a point, undercutting my WPM.

06:47.783 --> 06:51.620
Let's not harbor any Pinteresque fantasies.
We'll have scant minutes to argue...

06:51.703 --> 06:53.789
and we have to maximize
our collective WPM.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.749
Okay. Let's just get going.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.837
- Paris, were we expecting you?
- You should have been.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.880
I'm going to get set up.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.050
I'm going to my room
to work on my WPM.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.718
- Do I wanna know?
- No.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.804
I'll get it!

07:09.763 --> 07:11.390
- Hello?
- It's Chris.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.433
- How's it going?
- Good.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.603
I'm on a business trip here,
and I thought I'd check in on Rory.

07:16.687 --> 07:19.606
She went to a biker party
a few days ago and never came back.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.859
- Again?
- We gotta start disciplining that girl.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.235
Who's got the time?

07:23.277 --> 07:27.072
She's right here. I'll pass you to her.
Where did this business trip take you?

07:27.155 --> 07:29.116
Your neck of the woods:
The Litchfield area.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.409
Really? How long?

07:30.450 --> 07:34.663
A couple of days, or for as long as it takes
for them to succumb to my infinite charm.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.582
If you're still here on Friday...

07:36.665 --> 07:39.585
you should come on down
and see Rory in a debate at Chilton.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.296
- Really?
- Yeah, it starts at 3:30.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.090
First come, first served.
They're expecting 20,000 people...

07:45.174 --> 07:47.384
- so I'd get there early.
- Chilton up close?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.803
It's your chance to see
the famous Paris in action.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.890
- There might even be casualties.
- Okay, tell Rory I'll be there.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.349
- Really?
- Why not?

07:54.433 --> 07:57.603
- She'll be excited. Tell her yourself.
- Pass me on.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.438
Dairy's bad because of the mucus.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.024
You haven't had any
in the last 48 hours, have you?

08:02.107 --> 08:03.817
In my cereal this morning.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.779
There's a solution of salt water
and vinegar that can help cut that.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.909
Girls, I'm sorry to interrupt
The Vinegar Hour, but it's your dad.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.411
Dad, hi.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.789
- Did you give her the cereal?
- I'd rather not say.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.261
- Hello?
- It's me.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.139
Lane, this is flat-out stalking.

08:34.181 --> 08:38.143
I don't have much time. I've already
used up my five minutes of phone time...

08:38.184 --> 08:39.227
but I had to talk to you.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.980
There's a new Belle and Sebastian single
coming out today.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.440
- I know.
- I have to have it.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.442
- Okay.
- I have to have it.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.945
- I don't know if I have time to pick it up.
- What?

08:47.986 --> 08:50.822
Do you want to hear how I used up
my phone time today?

08:50.864 --> 08:53.867
Talking to Amazon. Com,
trying to get them to overnight it...

08:53.951 --> 08:57.246
in a package referencing
something Korean and religious.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.748
- Wouldn't do it?
- I think they notified the government.

08:59.832 --> 09:02.292
Can't you wait
for your grounding to be over?

09:02.376 --> 09:03.752
I am a fanatic audiophile.

09:03.836 --> 09:06.797
That comes with responsibilities
that a grounding doesn't alter.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.675
I have to have this single
and you have to get it to me.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.719
- Okay, I'll do my best.
- Thank you. I have to go.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.392
- And you've got something in your teeth.
- Stop that.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.947
There you are. Where were you?

09:32.030 --> 09:34.533
I thought we would meet
by the vending machines...

09:34.616 --> 09:36.577
for a little pre-debate non-dairy snack.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.245
Paris wanted to do a sound check...

09:38.328 --> 09:40.414
and she found problems
with the acoustics here.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.167
The layout on this row of seats
is causing a bass problem.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.419
We've got to move
this whole row over a foot.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.879
Just move these people out.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.924
Better find a seat
before she moves them all.

09:51.008 --> 09:52.634
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.178
- Glad you came.
- No, you're not.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.972
- What?
- I'm just getting you in the mood.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.851
- Did you see Christopher anywhere?
- No.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.354
What does he look like?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.732
If you don't know, why are you looking?

10:06.773 --> 10:10.152
I'm looking for a guy that looks like a guy
that you could be with...

10:10.235 --> 10:12.905
only I'm deducting 17 years off his age
and I'm adding...

10:12.946 --> 10:15.407
an all-boys private school uniform
and a Yankees cap.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.409
- And does your head hurt?
- Yeah, it does.

10:17.492 --> 10:20.037
If everybody could please take their seats,
we'll begin.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.123
That includes all the members
of the debate teams.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.920
- Brad. Hi.
- Hi, Rory.

10:28.253 --> 10:31.089
- I didn't think you'd remember me.
- Of course I do.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.674
- How's your new school?
- I love it.

10:32.758 --> 10:35.093
It's more mellow there,
and I made a ton of friends.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.221
- Good for you.
- Brad.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.599
- Paris.
- Guess we're going mano a mano today.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.602
- Oh, God.
- All right.

10:43.644 --> 10:47.231
The topic for today's debate
is doctor-assisted suicide.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.067
- That's pleasant.
- Let me introduce the debaters.

10:50.108 --> 10:54.530
On the Hillside Academy team, we have
Brad Langford and Nancy Waterford.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.324
- You look sick.
- I feel sick.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.953
And on the Chilton team,
we have Rory Gilmore and Paris Geller.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.417
- Were we not supposed to do that?
- Maybe no one noticed.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.628
Teams will have three minutes
for openings...

11:09.711 --> 11:12.548
three minutes for rebuttals,
and two minutes for conclusions.

11:12.631 --> 11:16.218
They will be judged on the basis
of content, strategy, and style.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.762
I will be the judge
along with Mrs. Gladstone.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.556
Mrs. O'Malley is impregnable...

11:20.639 --> 11:23.475
but yesterday I complimented
Mrs. Gladstone's dumpy outfit...

11:23.559 --> 11:26.937
and bought her an ice-cream sandwich.
She practically licked my hand.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.146
Nice going.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.733
We choose which team takes
the pro or con side with the toss of a coin.

11:31.817 --> 11:34.695
- A member of Hillside will make the call.
- Heads.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.738
No, tails! I mean tails!

11:38.198 --> 11:39.575
It's heads.

11:39.658 --> 11:40.993
Chilton will pick. Pro or con?

11:41.076 --> 11:43.287
- Pro assisted suicide.
- What a shock.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.956
All right. Whenever you're ready,
you may commence.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.167
Thank you. Keep it snappy.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.799
There are many vantage points...

11:55.883 --> 11:59.303
from which to consider
doctor-assisted suicide.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.472
Serious consideration
draws from ethics, law...

12:02.556 --> 12:06.685
medical practices, philosophy,
psychology, public policy, and religion...

12:06.768 --> 12:10.022
all topics I plan to explore in the next
2 minutes and 46 seconds.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.025
- Look at that kid. He's shaking.
- And pale.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.277
He looks all white and tiny.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.615
...either information or the actual means,
such as medication or other supplies...

12:19.698 --> 12:22.951
to a person who wishes to terminate
his or her own life.

12:23.035 --> 12:25.287
The patient must then initiate the process.

12:25.370 --> 12:29.124
The goal is euthanasia,
a term with its roots in ancient Greek.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.755
...and referencing their last point
which erroneously cited South Carolina...

12:34.838 --> 12:37.549
as a state that has neither a statute
nor common law...

12:37.633 --> 12:39.384
which prohibits assisted suicide...

12:39.468 --> 12:42.513
when we know that North Carolina
is the proper citation...

12:42.596 --> 12:46.058
their subsequent argument falls short
of even a level of speciousness...

12:46.141 --> 12:49.394
due to the fact that it doesn't even have
a ring of factual truth...

12:49.436 --> 12:51.146
let alone its substance.

12:51.480 --> 12:55.108
And after all, the absence of prohibition
against assisted suicide...

12:55.192 --> 12:58.529
is a far cry from a statute
which actually legitimizes the practice...

12:58.570 --> 13:01.907
a state of affairs which today
exists only in Oregon, sadly enough...

13:01.949 --> 13:04.493
under the 1997 Death Without Dignity Act.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.745
Circus lady, what's with the contortions?

13:06.787 --> 13:09.498
I'm trying to sneak a peek
at the girl Christopher's with.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.584
The concept behind 'sneak'
is not having people notice you...

13:12.668 --> 13:14.878
and what you're doing
is shouting, 'Notice me!'

13:14.962 --> 13:17.798
- Tell me you're not curious.
- I'm not curious.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.174
You are, too.

13:19.258 --> 13:21.093
We'll meet her in a matter of minutes.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.971
Come on, watch the tiny shaking boy
get shorter.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.848
Two minutes for conclusion.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.103
...concerns the increasingly
pressing nature of this debate...

13:31.186 --> 13:33.981
as the baby-boomer generation
enters their graying years...

13:34.064 --> 13:37.484
and begins to place an insupportable
burden over the nation's already...

13:37.568 --> 13:39.528
You sneak a little peek?

13:39.653 --> 13:42.447
Professor Bowmar of
Willamette University College of Law...

13:42.489 --> 13:45.576
has prepared a summary
that I'd like to use in my remaining time.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.952
- Time.
- What?

13:46.994 --> 13:49.413
- Time's up.
- Lf I could have a few seconds...

13:49.454 --> 13:51.790
to rebut their charge
of the cruelty of the act...

13:51.832 --> 13:54.585
- We take it back.
- You can't take it back. It's a debate.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.087
Okay, that's enough cruelty
for one day, Paris.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.131
Your team has won. Congratulations.

13:59.173 --> 14:02.259
Really? Thank you. Thank you very much.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.018
You put up a good fight.
Better luck next time.

14:11.810 --> 14:12.936
You okay?

14:13.020 --> 14:15.939
I'm sweating.
I'm completely soaked through.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.816
And I think I'm catching a cold.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.402
Do you need a hug, or a towel?

14:20.485 --> 14:21.778
No, thanks.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.739
I think I'm just gonna sit here quietly.

14:25.199 --> 14:27.201
- There they are.
- I see them, what do you think?

14:27.284 --> 14:29.995
She's got good hair.
Plus, she's been sitting for an hour...

14:30.037 --> 14:32.247
and her dress is unwrinkled.
How does she do that?

14:32.331 --> 14:35.000
- She must be a witch.
- She's doing that no-hose thing.

14:35.042 --> 14:38.003
She's a chic, good-haired, wrinkle-free,
no-hose-wearing witch.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.671
- You ready?
- Yeah.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.133
Hi, there, you two.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.844
Hi, Lorelai. You guys get to meet at last.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.304
- This is...
- Sherrie.

14:47.346 --> 14:50.182
- Nice to meet you.
- I recognize you from your Christmas card.

14:50.265 --> 14:53.560
- Which I'm sure you mocked.
- Did not. Others, yes, but not yours.

14:53.644 --> 14:55.771
You were cute. And the puppy was cute.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.940
- This is Sookie.
- Nice to meet you.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.651
Nice to meet you.
You have a very smooth dress.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.153
Thank you. It's the fabric.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.404
The fabric.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.823
- Chris, I've told you about Sookie.
- Yes, you have.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.867
- The famous Sookie.
- The famous Christopher.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.245
I hear you're the greatest chef
after Alain Ducasse.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.705
After Alain Ducasse? Who said 'after'?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.207
Hi, Dad. You came.

15:15.541 --> 15:18.544
- Of course I did.
- Sorry, I'm still getting used to it.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.670
I'm glad.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.839
- Look who Dad brought.
- This is Sherrie.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.132
- Sherrie, this is Rory.
- Finally.

15:24.216 --> 15:28.053
I am so beyond thrilled, I can't tell you.
All he does is talk about you.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.138
I couldn't wait to meet
this amazing person.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.975
- She lives up to the hype.
- Is my face turning red?

15:33.058 --> 15:34.226
Yeah, beet red.

15:34.309 --> 15:37.813
I'm sorry. I put you on the spot.
I've just been looking forward to this.

15:37.896 --> 15:40.190
- No, it's okay.
- Will you excuse us?

15:40.274 --> 15:44.528
Rory wanted to show me something
around the corner. We'll be right back.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.072
- So Rory was great.
- Brilliant.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.700
So, who said I was after Alain Ducasse?

15:49.783 --> 15:51.118
- He brought Sherrie.
- I know.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.202
- This is a little...
- Yeah.

15:52.286 --> 15:54.538
- Did you talk to her, is she nice?
- She's a witch.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.081
Good.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.583
- What do we do?
- What do you mean?

15:57.624 --> 16:00.210
We got to put on our hostessing hats
and set a game plan.

16:00.294 --> 16:02.838
It would be impolite
if we didn't ask them to hang out.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.465
- Do we hit the vending machines?
- Invite them to Luke's?

16:05.549 --> 16:07.801
- Does she seem like a diner chick?
- Probably not.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.012
- I wish he'd said she was with him.
- Where else?

16:10.095 --> 16:13.056
- Al's Pancake World.
- It's Friday. He does his prix-fixe menu.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.350
- There's always our house.
- It's a mess.

16:15.434 --> 16:17.102
- Might be the safest?
- Okay.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.730
- Why didn't he say she was with him?
- I don't know.

16:19.771 --> 16:23.650
It's more of an expression
than something I actually heard.

16:23.734 --> 16:26.778
But maybe someone implied
that I was after him?

16:27.112 --> 16:28.572
- Sookie.
- Yeah.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.950
Know what? You are the greatest chef
in the world, bar none.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.619
Thanks.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.622
- Are you guys doing anything now?
- Not really.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.457
We're pretty free for the day.

16:38.499 --> 16:41.585
- Why don't you come and see our place?
- That would be great!

16:41.668 --> 16:43.587
Sure, we'd love that. Thanks.

16:43.629 --> 16:46.423
I was hoping we'd see
where Rory lives and her room.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.550
- My room's no big deal.
- And the books.

16:48.634 --> 16:51.345
I have heard all about the books.
I can't wait to see them.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.680
Let's go and see the books.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.098
Rory.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.768
Great job. We pretty much
wiped the floor with them.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.937
We turned them into cleaning products.

16:59.978 --> 17:03.315
The verbatim transcripts of the debate
will be ready in a half-hour.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.652
I thought we could wait and talk
about what we did right and wrong...

17:06.734 --> 17:07.986
compare WPMs.

17:08.028 --> 17:12.199
I'm actually heading with my group
back to our house, so I really can't.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.661
Okay. Whatever.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.914
If you don't want to celebrate with me,
that's just fine!

17:24.461 --> 17:27.172
- You do the living room, I'll do the kitchen.
- And upstairs?

17:27.256 --> 17:30.133
- I'll block the fool who goes upstairs!
- Company is stressful.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.177
- Don't forget your room!
- What?

17:32.219 --> 17:34.054
Your room! She wants to see the books.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.597
I'll hit it next.

17:36.390 --> 17:38.475
They're gonna want
something to eat and drink!

17:38.559 --> 17:40.519
- Company usually does.
- We have nothing.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.854
We must have something.

17:41.895 --> 17:45.566
Only if Divine Providence has placed
a brie-and-cracker plate in the fridge.

17:45.649 --> 17:48.735
- We have leftover Halloween candy.
- Waste that on company?

17:48.819 --> 17:50.946
Having company
is about making sacrifices.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.865
- Martha Stewart?
- I paraphrased Proust.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.157
I should have known.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.076
Presentation is everything.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.911
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

17:58.036 --> 18:01.165
- Need some more time to clean up?
- He knows us too well.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.794
Come on in.
How'd you know we were cleaning?

18:05.878 --> 18:09.006
When you cut us off in the parking lot
and sped off doing 60...

18:09.047 --> 18:11.800
I figured you were trying to
beat us home for a reason.

18:11.884 --> 18:15.846
- I hope we're not ruining your day.
- No, we love company. Please, come in.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.850
- Your house is great.
- Thanks, we like it. Have a seat.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.561
Rory, you were wonderful
in the debate today.

18:22.603 --> 18:23.645
Thanks.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.480
That Paris was a little intense.

18:25.564 --> 18:28.400
A little? The opposing team
could bring her up on war crimes.

18:28.483 --> 18:31.111
Her approach will come in handy
when she becomes a CEO...

18:31.195 --> 18:33.071
or a dictator of a country or something.

18:33.113 --> 18:36.408
You were very poised,
very sure of yourself, just like your dad.

18:36.450 --> 18:38.744
- And your mom.
- Shucks, Pa.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.622
And your uniform is darling.
I love the blue.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.749
Of course, I'm sure
you look good in anything.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.418
- You should see her in chaps.
- Really?

18:46.835 --> 18:49.254
No. That was just my mom being funny.

18:50.214 --> 18:52.216
It comes and goes. You'll notice the signs.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.885
The waves get still,
and the animals start to act funny.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.929
- I went to private school, too.
- Really?

18:57.012 --> 18:59.556
Except that our colors
were white and bright red.

18:59.598 --> 19:00.682
I looked hideous.

19:00.766 --> 19:03.602
She's being self-deprecating.
You looked cute in that outfit.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.437
I looked like a peppermint stick.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.940
That's where my addiction
to clothes comes from:

19:07.981 --> 19:10.943
Making up for years of having to wear
the same thing every day.

19:11.026 --> 19:14.071
- I can understand that.
- We should go shopping sometime...

19:14.112 --> 19:16.782
- for clothes or whatever.
- Yeah. We could do that.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.242
- Soon, okay?
- Sure.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.953
Who wants something to drink?
I've got water, soda...

19:21.036 --> 19:23.288
- Just water for me.
- Me, too.

19:23.372 --> 19:25.123
Making it easy. I love it.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.458
I'll help you.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.460
No... Okay.

19:28.669 --> 19:31.171
- You don't have to help me.
- No, I want to.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.339
Great.

19:33.090 --> 19:36.969
Do you want flat water or sparkling?
I hope flat, 'cause I don't have sparkling.

19:37.052 --> 19:39.471
Or flat. Or ice cubes. I have cups, I think.

19:39.513 --> 19:41.723
It's a little awkward, isn't it?

19:41.807 --> 19:43.350
- What?
- Us.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.561
You and me. Our being here.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.730
- No, not really.
- But kind of, right?

19:48.814 --> 19:50.482
We're just not used to company.

19:50.524 --> 19:53.694
You and Christopher were so close.
I know it was years ago...

19:53.777 --> 19:55.696
but these things are never simple.

19:55.946 --> 19:58.615
Just in general, things like this
are always awkward...

19:58.657 --> 20:00.617
slightly, but only slightly.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.995
Look. Apple juice.

20:03.162 --> 20:05.914
With a perfectly respectable
expiration date.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.500
I just want you to know...

20:08.584 --> 20:11.712
that you should not feel
like you need to get to know me.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.005
At all.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.131
Okay.

20:14.214 --> 20:18.051
Just because Christopher and I are close
doesn't mean that we need to be close.

20:18.135 --> 20:21.930
- Or friends. Or anything, for that matter.
- No, I guess not.

20:22.014 --> 20:25.184
Except for our unexpected visit,
we may never have even met.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.311
I think we would have met eventually.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.062
Perhaps at some function or other.

20:29.146 --> 20:32.065
You, me, Martin Sheen,
all chained to the same tree.

20:32.149 --> 20:33.692
But I desperately want to know Rory.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.986
- Sure, a great kid.
- That's okay with you?

20:36.028 --> 20:37.321
That's fine.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.616
I'm so glad to hear that,
because things are kind of speeding up...

20:40.699 --> 20:42.993
- between me and Christopher and...
- Really?

20:43.035 --> 20:46.205
- Rory is so important to him.
- Yeah, I know. She is.

20:46.330 --> 20:49.208
He told me how he really wasn't
in her life for years...

20:49.291 --> 20:52.252
and how he'd like to make up
for all that time that he wasted.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.463
- He's been doing really well lately.
- I know.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.715
He is obsessive about his call dates to her.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.343
It doesn't matter where we are
or what we're doing...

20:59.384 --> 21:02.513
he's got to call Rory
Wednesday nights at 7:00.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.348
I like that about him.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.059
- Yeah. Me, too.
- He wants me to bond with her, too.

21:07.142 --> 21:09.394
It's important with everything
we have coming.

21:09.478 --> 21:12.523
- I totally understand.
- Good. I'm glad.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.902
What are the chances of Rory and I
getting together on this trip?

21:16.985 --> 21:18.529
- This trip?
- How about tonight?

21:18.612 --> 21:20.072
- Tonight?
- Rory seemed up for it.

21:20.155 --> 21:23.408
Tonight. It's kind of last minute
and we're supposed to go somewhere.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.410
The Friday-night dinner with your parents.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.454
- You know about those?
- All about them.

21:27.538 --> 21:30.541
Christopher said you can get her
out of them if there's a need.

21:30.624 --> 21:34.044
- That's true to a certain extent, but...
- This is pressing.

21:34.086 --> 21:36.505
I am so forcing myself here,
it's embarrassing.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.090
But that's how important it is.

21:38.173 --> 21:41.301
Who knows when this opportunity
is going to present itself again.

21:41.385 --> 21:42.803
- Right.
- So?

21:45.138 --> 21:46.223
Sure.

21:46.265 --> 21:49.601
You'll have to ask Rory,
but if it's okay with her, it's okay with me.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.603
You're as great
as Christopher said you were.

21:51.687 --> 21:53.939
He's an excellent judge of character.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.441
Okay. I'll see you back out there?

21:58.735 --> 22:01.530
- Everything okay?
- Yup, she found apple juice.

22:01.613 --> 22:04.575
- Rory, will you get that, please?
- Let the machine pick it up.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.869
- It could be important.
- Okay.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.499
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

22:13.292 --> 22:15.002
I'm still in the kitchen.

22:15.127 --> 22:17.546
I just wanted to tell you
that Sherrie asked me...

22:17.629 --> 22:19.173
if both of you could go out tonight.

22:19.256 --> 22:22.467
She trapped me into saying
I'd get you out of Friday dinner.

22:22.551 --> 22:25.470
I said she had to ask you,
so you can get out of it.

22:25.554 --> 22:29.099
But it may be good to get this over with,
'cause it seems inevitable.

22:29.141 --> 22:33.103
If you're okay going with her,
say, 'Sorry, Leonard, I'll call you back. '

22:33.145 --> 22:35.772
Sorry, Leonard, we've got company.
Call you back.

22:35.814 --> 22:37.191
Okay. Bye.

22:38.859 --> 22:41.153
Okay, here's your drink. Who was that?

22:41.361 --> 22:42.654
That was Leonard.

22:42.738 --> 22:44.865
- Did you tell him we have company?
- Yeah.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.159
- Who's Leonard?
- A friend.

22:47.201 --> 22:49.244
- Of yours or Lorelai's?
- Mutual friend.

22:49.328 --> 22:50.621
It's pretty much equal.

22:50.662 --> 22:53.332
- A mutual Leonard.
- We're constantly fighting over him.

22:53.373 --> 22:56.168
- Rory, can I run something by you?
- Sure.

22:56.251 --> 22:59.338
We're around for another night,
and he's totally sick of me.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.714
Not true.

23:00.797 --> 23:05.052
Anyhow, I was wondering if you wanted
to do something with me tonight.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.221
- Sure, that would be nice.
- Really?

23:07.304 --> 23:09.723
If it's okay with my mom...

23:09.806 --> 23:12.392
because we do have
a Grandma-Grandpa dinner tonight.

23:12.476 --> 23:14.061
- It's fine by me.
- Great.

23:14.144 --> 23:16.522
Of course, this does leave you
a sad little orphan.

23:16.605 --> 23:19.733
I'll have one of my patented
White Castle bachelor dinners.

23:19.816 --> 23:22.486
Or you can come with me tonight,
if you want.

23:22.528 --> 23:23.612
To your parents?

23:23.695 --> 23:26.031
'Cause with Rory not there,
I might need a hostage.

23:26.073 --> 23:28.867
- Yes, do it.
- Okay, it's good grub.

23:28.951 --> 23:31.203
- You sure they won't be mad?
- They like you.

23:31.286 --> 23:34.248
- True.
- We should go get cleaned up for tonight.

23:34.331 --> 23:36.667
- Thanks for having us over like this.
- Anytime.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.211
- We'll swing by around 6:00.
- Sounds good.

23:39.253 --> 23:40.963
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Dad.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.257
Goodbye, Leonard.

23:49.137 --> 23:52.850
- Honey, hurry, they said 6:00.
- It's 6:00 Dad-time, so it's more like 6:30.

23:52.891 --> 23:54.434
Dad-time is linked to Sherrie-time.

23:54.518 --> 23:56.728
- Sherrie seems awfully punctual.
- That's annoying.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.730
They have to live with their deficiencies.

23:58.772 --> 24:00.899
- I'll get it.
- Lf it's Leonard, I'll call back.

24:00.983 --> 24:02.484
He's so needy.

24:02.860 --> 24:03.902
Hello?

24:03.986 --> 24:06.405
- Humongous snag in the CD drop plan.
- What happened?

24:06.488 --> 24:08.448
Bible class has been moved an hour later...

24:08.532 --> 24:10.701
to accommodate
the teacher's handball schedule.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.579
- The Reverend plays handball?
- I'm just as appalled.

24:13.662 --> 24:15.289
It's at 10:00 instead of 9:00.

24:15.372 --> 24:18.500
- I'll make the necessary adjustments.
- Thank you.

24:19.418 --> 24:20.669
So, anything new?

24:20.752 --> 24:22.838
My dad brought his girlfriend
to my debate.

24:22.921 --> 24:25.090
The potential stepmom? My God.

24:25.174 --> 24:26.592
What's she like? What'd she say?

24:26.675 --> 24:29.303
Tell me in 11 seconds
'cause that's the time I have left.

24:29.386 --> 24:32.764
- That's too much pressure.
- Then write a long, descriptive letter...

24:32.848 --> 24:37.102
and slip it into the CD booklet.
Include a candid Polaroid of her if you can.

24:37.144 --> 24:38.395
- I'll try.
- Gotta go.

24:38.437 --> 24:39.438
Bye.

24:40.022 --> 24:42.733
- Can we come in?
- Yeah, come on in.

24:43.275 --> 24:45.444
- You look great.
- You, too.

24:45.736 --> 24:47.779
- Hi, there. You ready to go?
- All set.

24:47.863 --> 24:50.115
We won't be too late,
probably around 10:00.

24:50.199 --> 24:53.952
If you want a drink, Rory's got the list
of places that serve minors.

24:53.994 --> 24:55.329
I got a flask in my purse.

24:55.412 --> 24:58.165
I'll have to drink a lot of coffee
to keep up with you two.

24:58.248 --> 25:00.959
- Damn, our secret's been revealed.
- Bye, love.

25:01.585 --> 25:02.753
- Have fun.
- Okay.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.213
- Bye, sweets.
- Bye.

25:06.298 --> 25:08.050
- There they go.
- Yeah.

25:08.133 --> 25:11.053
Sherrie's excited about this.
Such a great opportunity.

25:11.136 --> 25:13.722
- Thanks for making it happen.
- That's what I'm here for.

25:13.805 --> 25:16.517
- Let me just get my coat, and we can go.
- Great.

25:17.601 --> 25:20.437
- Can I ask you a quick question?
- Sure. What?

25:20.812 --> 25:23.524
When I invited you to Rory's debate,
was Sherrie with you?

25:23.607 --> 25:26.109
Yeah, she's been with me
the whole trip. Why?

25:26.193 --> 25:28.320
You gave me no indication
that she was with you.

25:28.403 --> 25:29.655
- What?
- I must have.

25:29.738 --> 25:32.991
- No, singular pronouns all the way.
- I don't remember what I said.

25:33.075 --> 25:35.869
I do. You said, 'I'll be there,'
as in just you.

25:35.953 --> 25:39.414
I wasn't making a point of saying that.
It just came out that way.

25:39.498 --> 25:41.750
Okay, whatever. I was just wondering.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.795
It's okay that I brought Sherrie along,
isn't it?

25:44.837 --> 25:47.798
Absolutely.
It was just a surprise, that's all.

25:47.840 --> 25:48.841
Okay.

25:49.383 --> 25:51.385
- You weren't trying to hide the fact?
- No.

25:51.468 --> 25:54.346
Obviously you'd find out
she was with me once we arrived.

25:54.388 --> 25:55.806
- Obviously.
- Okay, then.

25:55.848 --> 25:56.974
Okay.

26:00.853 --> 26:04.565
- So what do you think of her?
- I don't know her well enough to judge.

26:04.648 --> 26:07.025
That's never stopped you
from judging people before.

26:07.109 --> 26:08.360
I'm trying to grow.

26:08.402 --> 26:10.445
She was saying
really nice things about you.

26:10.529 --> 26:11.572
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:11.655 --> 26:13.365
She said you guys had a nice talk.

26:13.407 --> 26:16.160
If that's what she said,
then I guess we did.

26:16.201 --> 26:17.578
- Lorelai, come on.
- What?

26:17.661 --> 26:18.662
You're being cryptic.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.415
- Did something happen between you two?
- No, I just...

26:21.498 --> 26:23.959
I thought our conversation
was a little odd.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.836
This is being less cryptic?

26:26.003 --> 26:29.548
It's just that she went on and on about
how we never have to be friends...

26:29.631 --> 26:33.218
or get to know each other at all
or try to force any kind of relationship.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.929
Really? She never mentioned that part.

26:39.892 --> 26:42.519
How come she figures
she never has to see me?

26:42.728 --> 26:45.564
I'm sure she was trying to
make you feel at ease around her.

26:45.606 --> 26:48.192
Because it's true,
you guys don't have to force anything.

26:48.275 --> 26:50.485
Where'd she get this
'don't force it' philosophy?

26:50.569 --> 26:51.945
- Not from me.
- You sure?

26:52.029 --> 26:53.280
Yes, I'm sure.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.699
So she just wants to
get to know Rory, not me.

26:55.741 --> 26:58.994
- I did steer her toward bonding with Rory.
- But not with me.

26:59.077 --> 27:01.371
Rory's my daughter.
Sherrie has to get to know her.

27:01.413 --> 27:02.456
I know.

27:02.539 --> 27:05.709
I wasn't purposely omitting you
or saying not to interact with you.

27:05.751 --> 27:07.377
Good, so you're not having me killed?

27:07.461 --> 27:11.173
I was going over my 'people to kilI' list,
and I don't think you were on it.

27:11.256 --> 27:14.426
Because by the fact that Rory exists,
I am in the picture.

27:14.468 --> 27:17.179
You can back off, you'll be in Sherrie's life.

27:17.262 --> 27:18.222
Good.

27:18.555 --> 27:22.100
Not that you thought to do the same thing
when you were in my shoes.

27:22.184 --> 27:25.812
- What? What are you talking about?
- You had a fiancé, I believe.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.856
- Yes. Max.
- Right. Max.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.150
- That was not the same thing.
- Really?

27:30.400 --> 27:32.611
Max knew Rory.
Max got close to Rory, right?

27:32.694 --> 27:34.363
- Yes.
- He and I never met.

27:34.446 --> 27:37.157
I didn't know he existed
until late in the game.

27:37.241 --> 27:41.036
I didn't know you were engaged till you
called me from your bachelorette party.

27:41.119 --> 27:44.289
I wasn't invited to the wedding.
Or did my invitation get lost?

27:44.331 --> 27:45.916
You've moved a lot this past year.

27:45.958 --> 27:49.044
- I was never part of that equation.
- Okay, maybe.

27:49.127 --> 27:52.297
But trust me, you would have been part
of the equation eventually.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.799
Really, Chris, you would have.

27:53.841 --> 27:57.845
Then, trust me, Lorelai. Eventually,
you would have been part of this one.

28:13.986 --> 28:15.737
- Christopher.
- Hello, Emily.

28:15.821 --> 28:17.698
This is a surprise. Where's Rory?

28:17.781 --> 28:21.368
A last-minute thing came up,
but I brought a good substitute.

28:21.451 --> 28:23.787
Half her genes
in a nice, nifty Christopher package.

28:23.829 --> 28:26.915
We're letting the freezing air get in.
Come in.

28:27.666 --> 28:28.876
Is she sick?

28:28.959 --> 28:31.461
There are terrible things
making the rounds these days.

28:31.503 --> 28:32.838
No, she's not sick. Hi, Dad.

28:32.921 --> 28:35.674
Hello, Lorelai.
Christopher, this is a surprise.

28:35.716 --> 28:37.426
- A nice one, I hope.
- A very nice one.

28:37.509 --> 28:39.553
- How are you, Richard?
- You're looking well.

28:39.636 --> 28:41.680
So are you. You playing a lot of golf lately?

28:41.763 --> 28:43.140
More like it's playing me.

28:43.182 --> 28:45.726
Let's not stand here.
Come into the living room.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.436
Now who wants a drink?

28:47.853 --> 28:51.064
- Martini, Manhattan, some Scotch?
- Yes, please.

28:51.481 --> 28:54.359
- You want to narrow that down?
- Hooch is hooch, Dad.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.904
- I'll have a Manhattan.
- Same here.

28:57.279 --> 28:59.948
- You never said where Rory is.
- Rory's not here?

29:00.032 --> 29:02.868
You didn't even notice
your own granddaughter isn't here?

29:02.910 --> 29:05.370
She's so quiet.
She sometimes slips in unnoticed.

29:05.412 --> 29:06.788
She should work for the CIA.

29:06.872 --> 29:08.999
- One cherry good for everybody?
- Fine with me.

29:09.041 --> 29:10.959
- Me, too.
- Eight, please. I'm peckish.

29:11.043 --> 29:14.338
- I noticed that Rory isn't here.
- You've got that eagle eye, Mom.

29:14.546 --> 29:17.633
It's my fault. My girlfriend and I
were passing through town...

29:17.716 --> 29:19.676
and we dropped by
Stars Hollow for a visit.

29:19.718 --> 29:22.054
She and Rory are off
doing something together.

29:22.095 --> 29:23.889
- You have a girlfriend?
- Sherrie.

29:23.931 --> 29:27.226
- She and Rory are out together?
- I'm sorry. I should have called.

29:27.267 --> 29:30.687
That would have been thoughtful.
We set a place for her at the table.

29:30.729 --> 29:32.731
Chris is here, so it won't go to waste.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.234
Normally I demand
my own customized place setting.

29:35.275 --> 29:37.361
How long have you been with this woman?

29:37.444 --> 29:39.905
- Eight months.
- I'll bet she's pretty.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.782
Yes, she's very pretty.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.326
- Something in your eye, Lorelai?
- I got it.

29:44.409 --> 29:47.746
- You've met this woman?
- Yes, today. And she's very nice.

29:47.788 --> 29:49.248
What does she do? Does she work?

29:49.331 --> 29:51.875
She's the East Coast sales rep
for I'Oréal cosmetics.

29:51.917 --> 29:55.712
- Sounds like a lot of responsibility.
- It keeps her busy, involves some travel.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.172
- What are they doing?
- What?

29:57.256 --> 30:00.050
Rory and Christopher's friend.
What are they doing tonight?

30:00.092 --> 30:01.927
Dinner and a movie. Something like that.

30:02.010 --> 30:03.512
It's my fault that we didn't call.

30:03.595 --> 30:05.639
- Your work has you traveling, too.
- Some.

30:05.722 --> 30:08.517
Everyone thinks that traveling on business
is so glamorous.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.977
But what they don't realize...

30:10.060 --> 30:12.938
is that the business traveler
never sees the places he visits.

30:13.021 --> 30:14.273
My last trip to Rome...

30:14.314 --> 30:17.609
I spent the whole four days
in a conference room by the airport.

30:17.651 --> 30:19.778
Might as well have been
in French Lick, Indiana.

30:19.862 --> 30:22.489
My trips are mostly local,
just me and my Volvo.

30:22.573 --> 30:24.449
- You have a Volvo?
- That's new?

30:24.491 --> 30:27.286
- I just got it.
- Excellent choice. It's nice and safe.

30:27.369 --> 30:30.747
- That's a good family car.
- It's also excellent for cranking Metallica.

30:30.789 --> 30:34.793
Cranking Metallica. If that's some sort
of drug reference, it isn't funny.

30:35.169 --> 30:37.462
So you're planning on having a family?

30:37.546 --> 30:38.839
- What?
- With this woman.

30:38.922 --> 30:41.466
Her name's Sherrie.
You're putting him on the spot here.

30:41.550 --> 30:43.760
He bought a family car.
It's a natural question.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.137
Dad called it a family car.

30:45.220 --> 30:49.016
I'm sure the sales contract doesn't say
you have to have a family to buy it.

30:49.099 --> 30:50.684
Though I didn't read the fine print.

30:50.767 --> 30:53.020
You always drove a motorcycle before,
didn't you?

30:53.103 --> 30:55.898
- I still got it.
- A family man shouldn't ride a motorcycle.

30:55.981 --> 31:00.194
The accidents I covered for the firm
involving motorcycles, the worst.

31:00.277 --> 31:03.614
Grisly. They use this industrial machine...

31:03.655 --> 31:07.284
to scrape the victims off the road
like a huge spatula.

31:07.534 --> 31:10.496
- Mouthful of cherries here.
- Are you living together?

31:10.537 --> 31:13.081
Get out the interrogation lamp,
why don't you?

31:13.165 --> 31:16.335
Yeah, but we're looking
for something bigger in the Boston area.

31:16.376 --> 31:18.295
There are a lot of nice, historical places.

31:18.337 --> 31:20.964
Something historical in our price range
would be perfect.

31:21.006 --> 31:23.926
You know historical homes
are infested with mold, don't you?

31:24.009 --> 31:26.053
- Mold?
- It gets inside the walls...

31:26.136 --> 31:28.222
and grows out of sight
and shoots off spores...

31:28.305 --> 31:29.973
that slowly kill you and your family.

31:30.015 --> 31:32.434
You should get a show on
the Home and Garden Channel.

31:32.518 --> 31:34.603
When did you become
an expert on mold, Emily?

31:34.686 --> 31:36.438
It was in the New York Times Magazine.

31:36.522 --> 31:39.566
I wouldn't buy a place with this woman
until you look into this.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.026
Sherrie.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.487
It's gonna come down
to whatever we can afford.

31:43.529 --> 31:45.030
It might be a newly-built place.

31:45.072 --> 31:47.491
With their shoddy craftsmanship?
You don't want that.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.201
What does that leave them, a teepee?

31:49.284 --> 31:51.912
I just don't think
that Rory should miss our dinners...

31:51.995 --> 31:54.206
for something other than
sickness or emergencies.

31:54.289 --> 31:56.583
- That was the agreement.
- I'm sorry, Emily. Really.

31:56.667 --> 31:59.962
Chris has apologized a hundred times.
How many more do you want?

32:00.045 --> 32:02.422
I can call Sherrie
and have her and Rory come by.

32:02.506 --> 32:05.008
That way, it won't be
a totally Rory-less evening.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.343
That's not what I want.

32:06.385 --> 32:08.262
We're desperately trying to work with you.

32:08.345 --> 32:11.348
Working with me is one thing,
patronizing me is another.

32:11.431 --> 32:12.683
Excuse me.

32:14.810 --> 32:16.061
I feel horrible.

32:16.103 --> 32:18.480
Don't, son. That's just Emily.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.566
I'll go see what I can do.

32:25.904 --> 32:28.240
You wanna tell me what's going on here?

32:28.407 --> 32:31.451
How can you let that horrible woman
take Rory like that?

32:31.535 --> 32:33.662
Calm down. It's only one night.

32:33.745 --> 32:36.248
That's how it starts.
She's getting her claws into her.

32:36.331 --> 32:37.457
Her claws?

32:37.541 --> 32:39.960
We'll never see Rory again
if that woman has her way.

32:40.043 --> 32:43.338
Hold it. Rory is my daughter, you know.
I have some control.

32:43.422 --> 32:46.049
You can't let her get Rory on weekends.
It can't happen.

32:46.091 --> 32:47.926
What is this about? Why are you so upset?

32:48.010 --> 32:50.721
Lorelai, are you blind
or just that humiliated?

32:50.762 --> 32:51.889
Humiliated?

32:51.930 --> 32:54.266
Christopher gets his life together
with that woman.

32:54.308 --> 32:56.894
- So that's good.
- It should have been you.

32:57.227 --> 32:59.521
- What?
- Don't play dumb, Lorelai.

32:59.605 --> 33:01.815
Deep down, I know you're heartbroken.

33:01.899 --> 33:04.735
- I'm not heartbroken.
- I am.

33:04.776 --> 33:07.154
I always pictured
the three of you together.

33:07.237 --> 33:09.948
After all these years,
and the bad things that happened...

33:10.032 --> 33:11.116
Rory with her parents.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.495
Now that Christopher's got
his life together, it's with her, not you.

33:14.578 --> 33:16.538
The timing was never right for us.

33:16.622 --> 33:20.083
That's because you dawdle time away.
You could've had that effect on him.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.753
It could've been you
helping him get his life together...

33:22.794 --> 33:23.837
but you made no effort.

33:23.921 --> 33:27.132
This comes down to something
I didn't do? Don't put that on me!

33:27.216 --> 33:28.967
What other explanation is there?

33:29.051 --> 33:30.594
He's always been crazy about you...

33:30.677 --> 33:33.347
but you kept him at arm's length,
like you do everyone.

33:33.430 --> 33:34.681
- That's not true.
- It is true.

33:34.765 --> 33:37.476
Your destiny was to be with Christopher.
Now it's too late.

33:37.559 --> 33:38.977
Then it wasn't our destiny!

33:39.019 --> 33:43.524
So you're saying you don't have feelings
for him, that all of this is fine with you?

33:44.107 --> 33:45.776
- That's not important.
- It's not?

33:45.817 --> 33:49.404
No. What's important is that
Christopher is doing well and he's happy...

33:49.488 --> 33:52.908
- and we should be happy for him.
- You're impossible. I need to lie down.

33:52.991 --> 33:56.829
Tell Christopher...
Tell him whatever you like, I don't care.

34:02.334 --> 34:03.919
You alone this morning?

34:04.044 --> 34:06.630
No, Rory's with me.
She had to run an errand.

34:06.672 --> 34:08.297
- Take whatever table you want.
- Okay.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.550
You okay?

34:09.842 --> 34:11.592
- Yeah.
- You don't seem your chipper self.

34:11.677 --> 34:14.513
I brought sparklers.
I'll light them later and do some kicks.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.181
I can clear the counter,
and you can play bagel hockey.

34:17.266 --> 34:19.851
- You can't play by yourself.
- I'll play with you.

34:19.935 --> 34:22.187
- You'll have to explain the rules.
- It's okay.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.813
I'm just recovering from last night.

34:23.897 --> 34:27.109
It was one of those nights where
you begin stepping in quicksand...

34:27.192 --> 34:29.444
and end up with a 16-ton anvil
on your head.

34:29.527 --> 34:31.737
I've had lots of those.
I'll get you some coffee.

34:31.822 --> 34:33.407
Can't hurt.

34:34.116 --> 34:36.368
- You order?
- No, just coffee.

34:36.451 --> 34:39.246
I must have been sound asleep
when you got home last night.

34:39.329 --> 34:40.789
You were snoring like a buzz saw.

34:40.873 --> 34:43.125
I believe that's defined
as a superfluous comment.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.333
Yes, you were sound asleep.

34:44.418 --> 34:48.380
So, I'm dying to hear about
your night with Sherrie. How was it?

34:48.422 --> 34:50.924
Give it to me, A to Z,
beginning to end, soup to nuts.

34:51.007 --> 34:53.177
- She is what she seems.
- Details, please.

34:53.260 --> 34:56.346
She's a cautious driver,
she doesn't roll through stop signs...

34:56.388 --> 34:58.640
doesn't speed,
always signals before she turns.

34:58.724 --> 35:01.351
Commendable, but not who I want
driving our getaway car.

35:01.393 --> 35:03.645
- What are we robbing?
- Sephora. We'd planned it.

35:03.729 --> 35:05.606
- Slipped my mind.
- What's her music taste?

35:05.689 --> 35:08.066
Big Bruce Springsteen fan,
seen him 20 times.

35:08.150 --> 35:10.110
Blue-collar roots or is she just slumming?

35:10.194 --> 35:12.654
Her dad had a shoe store,
her mom taught kindergarten.

35:12.738 --> 35:15.741
- You guys got into details.
- She was definitely in bonding mode.

35:15.824 --> 35:16.909
What else?

35:16.992 --> 35:19.786
She's very touchy-feely,
hand on the shoulder, lots of hugs.

35:19.870 --> 35:21.914
- Did she try to get fresh?
- Gross.

35:21.997 --> 35:22.998
Go on.

35:23.123 --> 35:25.792
She's had one prior serious relationship
in her life.

35:25.876 --> 35:28.921
- Finally, the juicy stuff.
- It lasted 11 years.

35:29.004 --> 35:30.839
Eleven years and she never got married?

35:30.923 --> 35:33.258
She never thought about it
because of her career...

35:33.300 --> 35:35.886
- but now she is, more and more.
- Tick-tock.

35:35.928 --> 35:38.472
In the past couple of years,
she hasn't dated anyone...

35:38.555 --> 35:41.475
unless she thought for sure
it could be a lasting relationship.

35:41.558 --> 35:43.977
And she's got specific goals now
concerning children.

35:44.061 --> 35:46.188
- Here we go.
- She wants at least two.

35:46.271 --> 35:49.608
Before she met Dad,
she was considering single parenthood.

35:49.691 --> 35:52.194
- That's wanting kids.
- That's about it.

35:52.277 --> 35:54.613
- She works for I'Oréal.
- I heard that.

35:54.655 --> 35:56.532
I'm tapped. How was your night?

35:56.615 --> 36:00.786
Fine, just took Mom five minutes
before she left the room in tears.

36:00.869 --> 36:03.622
She freaked out that you were
with Sherrie. Believe that?

36:03.705 --> 36:05.374
- She freaked?
- Totally.

36:05.457 --> 36:08.001
- She kept calling her 'that woman. '
- What did she think?

36:08.085 --> 36:10.879
You'd come home and find
a rabbit boiling on the stove?

36:10.963 --> 36:13.924
No, it had to do
with her and Christopher...

36:13.966 --> 36:17.010
Anyway, eventually she came down
and had a pouty dinner.

36:17.094 --> 36:18.512
It ended up okay?

36:18.595 --> 36:20.264
- For the most part.
- Is she mad at me?

36:20.305 --> 36:22.307
No, the angel child, never.

36:22.349 --> 36:23.517
Here you go.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.060
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

36:27.646 --> 36:29.606
- I want to ask you something.
- Ask.

36:29.690 --> 36:32.901
When you've thought about me
and your dad...

36:33.735 --> 36:36.029
what have you been thinking
all these years?

36:36.113 --> 36:38.365
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

36:38.448 --> 36:40.909
did you ever picture us
potentially together...

36:40.993 --> 36:42.953
like, 'we are family' together?

36:43.412 --> 36:44.788
Not really.

36:44.955 --> 36:47.624
But, sort of? It crossed your mind?

36:47.708 --> 36:50.836
- I feel like I'm on The Ricki Lake Show.
- Go, Rory!

36:50.919 --> 36:55.215
I'll admit I have pictured the three of us
living together at various times...

36:55.299 --> 36:59.011
but in the way that all kids picture
their estranged parents living together.

36:59.094 --> 37:01.346
The way they should be together,
but it's stupid.

37:01.388 --> 37:03.849
- It's not stupid.
- Yeah, I've pictured it.

37:04.057 --> 37:06.602
But I also pictured you
with Pee Wee Herman.

37:07.144 --> 37:09.938
We lived in his playhouse,
and we'd be talking to Chairy...

37:10.022 --> 37:13.025
- and Captain Carl would be walking by.
- Fun.

37:13.108 --> 37:16.445
And later, I pictured you
marrying Matthew Broderick.

37:16.528 --> 37:20.032
We lived in New York in this
great apartment in the Village...

37:20.115 --> 37:22.367
and we would talk about
his Ferris Bueller days.

37:22.409 --> 37:24.870
Think how easy Producers tickets
would be to get.

37:24.953 --> 37:27.998
- It would be fourth row center every night.
- I'm sorry...

37:28.081 --> 37:30.292
that Matthew and I
couldn't work it out, honey.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.044
I'll try to get over it.

37:33.754 --> 37:35.839
So should it have been me?

37:37.716 --> 37:40.552
Sorry, zero hour. I have to go.
I'll be right back.

37:50.103 --> 37:51.688
Come on.

38:00.614 --> 38:04.409
- Excuse me, Mrs. Kim? I'm Kirk.
- I've known you since you were two.

38:04.493 --> 38:06.453
That's no guarantee
that people remember me.

38:06.537 --> 38:08.580
- We're in a hurry.
- I won't take up much time.

38:08.664 --> 38:10.791
I was just wondering
what your store hours are.

38:10.874 --> 38:14.545
For people who come to buy things,
it's 10:00 to 6:00, Sunday through Friday.

38:14.586 --> 38:17.798
For those who wander, blocking aisles,
touching with dirty hands...

38:17.881 --> 38:20.175
never buying, asking for 80% off,
we're closed.

38:20.259 --> 38:21.385
I should jot this down.

38:21.426 --> 38:24.847
- You said 10:00 to 6:00. That's 10:00 a. m.?
- Yes.

38:25.472 --> 38:27.766
Okay. Thanks for your time.

38:35.774 --> 38:37.734
Oh, my God. Michel, are you okay?

38:37.776 --> 38:41.238
I've been running around
this stupid square for over an hour...

38:41.488 --> 38:44.116
because the plan
was to drop this CD at 9:00.

38:44.199 --> 38:45.909
No, it got changed to 10:00.

38:45.951 --> 38:48.245
I told my mom,
and she said she'd pass it on.

38:48.287 --> 38:51.123
- She didn't pass it on, did she?
- Definitely not.

38:51.165 --> 38:52.583
The mission was a success.

38:52.624 --> 38:54.668
Yes, my cardiologist will be thrilled.

38:54.751 --> 38:57.629
- I've got a cramp.
- Can I do anything for you?

38:57.671 --> 38:59.464
Get away from me, evil girl.

38:59.506 --> 39:02.676
Never will I do anything for you again
ever, ever, never!

39:02.968 --> 39:05.804
If it makes you feel any better,
you had really good form.

39:05.888 --> 39:09.308
- You're your mother's child.
- Thank you.

39:12.895 --> 39:14.313
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

39:14.396 --> 39:17.733
We just wanted to say a last goodbye.
Rory's not here?

39:17.816 --> 39:20.402
She went outside somewhere.
You could probably find her.

39:20.486 --> 39:23.155
I think I will.
We had such a great time last night.

39:23.238 --> 39:25.532
I hear your dinner was good.

39:25.991 --> 39:27.367
Yeah, it was great.

39:27.451 --> 39:31.121
I would love to see that house,
especially the portrait of Rory in the study.

39:31.163 --> 39:32.498
Any way I could get a picture?

39:32.539 --> 39:34.500
- I can send you one.
- That would be great.

39:34.583 --> 39:36.376
- So she's outside?
- Somewhere.

39:36.460 --> 39:39.671
- I'm gonna try to corral her.
- Bring her by so I can see her, too.

39:39.713 --> 39:43.258
- Okay. Bye, Lorelai. Thanks for everything.
- You're welcome. Bye.

39:45.344 --> 39:47.846
So, quite the evening of theater last night.

39:47.888 --> 39:50.724
The Gilmore family players
rival the Barrymores...

39:50.807 --> 39:52.851
for their sophisticated,
dramatic productions.

39:52.935 --> 39:55.479
I never thought she'd freak
over Rory not being there.

39:55.521 --> 39:58.524
- I never wanted you in that position.
- You couldn't have known.

39:58.565 --> 40:02.778
- Rory's missed dinner before.
- This was compounded by other things.

40:02.861 --> 40:04.071
What other things?

40:04.154 --> 40:07.533
You should know that when it comes
to Emily Gilmore, it's never simple.

40:07.574 --> 40:10.410
Got it. Looks like they found each other.

40:11.620 --> 40:15.040
Sherrie had a really good time
last night. I hope Rory did, too.

40:15.123 --> 40:17.376
- Yeah, she seemed to.
- Good.

40:19.002 --> 40:22.965
So, Chris, before you go,
I have something I want to say to you.

40:24.174 --> 40:26.552
- It's not an 'uh-oh. '
- Okay. What?

40:26.593 --> 40:31.390
I kind of realized something
with you and Sherrie visiting...

40:31.431 --> 40:33.934
and, God help me, because of what
my mother said to me.

40:34.017 --> 40:37.396
Inspiration can come
from the unlikeliest sources.

40:37.437 --> 40:39.606
I was just thinking, all these years...

40:39.690 --> 40:41.900
no matter what my relationship status
has been...

40:41.984 --> 40:44.945
whether I've been dating or hibernating
or whatever...

40:45.028 --> 40:49.408
I think I've always had you
in the back of my mind...

40:49.658 --> 40:52.202
you know,
the prospect of us being together.

40:52.578 --> 40:55.080
But this prospect
was sort of indefinitely on hold...

40:55.122 --> 40:59.084
while you found yourself
and got your personal life together...

40:59.126 --> 41:03.130
so that you could really be there for me
and especially for Rory.

41:03.755 --> 41:06.383
But you and I
have been so linked in my mind...

41:06.466 --> 41:11.388
that I think I've unconsciously sabotaged
every decent relationship I've had...

41:11.430 --> 41:14.850
including the one with Max,
because I was waiting for you.

41:14.933 --> 41:17.352
And I shouldn't have been.
Now that I see that...

41:17.436 --> 41:21.940
and I see you settling down with Sherrie,
I think I can move beyond it.

41:24.276 --> 41:27.613
- Good, I'm really glad it's good for you.
- It is.

41:30.782 --> 41:32.409
How dare you put that on me?

41:32.493 --> 41:34.786
- I'm just thanking you.
- Well, don't.

41:35.871 --> 41:37.706
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

41:37.789 --> 41:41.210
Damn it, Lorelai. You're dumping
15 years of unhappiness on me?

41:41.293 --> 41:45.005
Fifteen years of not having healthy,
lasting relationships on me?

41:45.255 --> 41:49.301
You're blaming me for breaking up with
Max and not marrying? That's my fault?

41:49.384 --> 41:52.429
- I did nothing to deserve that.
- I'm not saying that you did.

41:52.471 --> 41:54.473
- You're as good as saying it.
- No, I'm not.

41:54.556 --> 41:58.519
What did you expect from this divine
revelation you've been so kind to share?

41:58.602 --> 42:02.147
Did you want me to apologize for ruining
your life or comfort you and say:

42:02.231 --> 42:06.235
'There, there. Everything will be all right,'
so you can feel okay? Forget it!

42:06.318 --> 42:09.905
If there's anything you feel bad about,
you want to dump on my doorstep...

42:09.988 --> 42:11.615
just leave a note.

43:00.831 --> 43:01.832
English

43:02.305 --> 43:08.744
