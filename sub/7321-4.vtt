00:01.267 --> 00:03.258
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

00:03.303 --> 00:05.863
I had a bad night, I cried.
I'm over it. You need to get over it.

00:05.905 --> 00:07.668
I'm retaking my intern test.

00:07.707 --> 00:10.005
You and I are more than just roommates.

00:10.043 --> 00:12.841
We're friends.
You're probably one of my best friends.

00:12.879 --> 00:13.903
Best friend.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.780
You're the only woman
I've ever kissed.

00:16.816 --> 00:19.717
- You're freaking out, too?
- A lot of therapy time.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.712
Derek's moved in. We've taken it
to the next level. I am happy.

00:29.829 --> 00:33.390
<i>In 6500 BC,</i>
<i>some guy looked at his sick friend</i>

00:33.433 --> 00:35.458
<i>and said, "I have an idea.</i>

00:35.502 --> 00:38.938
<i>Why don't I drill a hole in your skull?</i>
<i>It'll make you feel better."</i>

00:38.972 --> 00:40.667
<i>Thus surgery was born.</i>

00:43.576 --> 00:46.067
- Hey.
- Uh...

00:46.112 --> 00:47.704
- Where's Mer?
- She's not here.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.408
Oh!

00:49.449 --> 00:54.546
- So you're just in there by yourself?
- I'm not... I'm waiting for her.

00:55.121 --> 00:57.282
- Love the outfit.
- What do you want?

00:57.323 --> 01:01.419
I need cash. I ordered a pizza
and Alex owes me 20 bucks,

01:01.461 --> 01:04.430
but he's not speaking to me
because I saw him crying

01:04.464 --> 01:06.227
over his crazy girlfriend,

01:06.266 --> 01:09.895
and there was a minute, a week ago,
I thought he'd be a human being,

01:09.936 --> 01:13.303
- and now he won't open the door.
- Run into the bathroom.

01:13.339 --> 01:14.772
Just go. Go!

01:15.375 --> 01:18.538
Karev! Give me a 20.

01:21.314 --> 01:22.338
Thank you.

01:24.951 --> 01:27.511
That was so awesome. Very cool.

01:27.554 --> 01:30.990
Not that I didn't think you were
cool before, but I did not.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.652
I just thought you were
all hair and, you know...

01:33.693 --> 01:36.389
Now cool. You want to share some pizza?

01:38.198 --> 01:40.223
<i>It takes</i>
<i>a certain brand of crazy</i>

01:40.266 --> 01:43.463
<i>to come up with an idea</i>
<i>like drilling into somebody's skull,</i>

01:43.503 --> 01:46.199
<i>but surgeons have always been</i>
<i>a confident bunch.</i>

01:46.239 --> 01:47.604
Your clothes, your room.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.132
The living room will not be
a dumping ground like the old place.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.343
Did you not hear her?

01:58.918 --> 02:01.148
OK. She kind of scares me.

02:01.187 --> 02:04.486
'Cause she's scary.
Callie needs a new best friend.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.686
Not bad, right?

02:08.495 --> 02:09.586
It's great.

02:09.628 --> 02:13.429
<i>We usually know what we're</i>
<i>doing. When we don't, we act like we do.</i>

02:13.466 --> 02:16.492
<i>We walk boldly into</i>
<i>undiscovered country, plant a flag,</i>

02:16.536 --> 02:18.299
<i>start ordering people around.</i>

02:18.338 --> 02:22.069
- Want to go on a date with me?
- <i>It's invigorating and terrifying.</i>

02:23.076 --> 02:24.703
Like a date date?

02:24.744 --> 02:27.713
Yeah, restaurant,
candlelight, bottle of wine.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.614
At the end of the night
I try to take your clothes off.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.778
OK. That would be a date.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.792
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.594
- You're...
- Naked and waiting for you.

02:50.937 --> 02:54.839
You keep a diary? Have I not known,
all this time, that you keep a diary?

02:54.874 --> 02:57.342
- No. I... I don't...
- Aw!

02:57.377 --> 02:59.402
Don't be shy. I think it's cute.

02:59.445 --> 03:01.538
- It's not mine.
- I won't read it.

03:02.515 --> 03:06.076
- Whose is it?
- Your mother's.

03:09.322 --> 03:14.419
It was in a big box full of old issues
of <i>The New England Journal of Medicine.</i>

03:14.460 --> 03:17.020
- Did you read it?
- No.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.322
I brought it up here for you.

03:19.365 --> 03:24.029
- Why were you going through her things?
- Trying to find space for my clothes.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.971
Your closet is full.

03:32.412 --> 03:35.438
I have to shower.
I've been hauling Cristina's boxes.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.656
- You haven't read any?
- No. What if I'm in it?

03:46.693 --> 03:48.957
I don't want to hear
what she thought of me.

03:48.995 --> 03:52.123
- What's worse, if you're in it or not?
- I don't know!

03:52.165 --> 03:56.693
I mean, see, why is he in the study
rooting around in closets

03:56.736 --> 04:01.036
- trying to dig up my mother's ghost?
- I think 'cause you invited him.

04:01.074 --> 04:04.441
Apparently some people thought
I was kidding last week

04:04.477 --> 04:08.641
when I announced nobody was going
to hang out on their favorite specialty.

04:08.681 --> 04:13.050
I wasn't.
Junior residents don't specialize,

04:13.086 --> 04:15.987
so all the requests
to send you back to that place

04:16.022 --> 04:18.387
where your true heart lives can end now.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.584
Dr. Bailey makes the assignments.

04:20.627 --> 04:23.596
Do not, and I repeat,
do not harangue her.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.793
O'Malley, I made a call.

04:30.837 --> 04:34.034
They don't have your score yet.
If I knew, I would tell you.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.234
Hey.

04:40.079 --> 04:44.448
You passed. We're gonna go to Joe's
tonight, and we're gonna celebrate.

04:44.484 --> 04:47.817
I'm gonna buy you a beer
and all the peanuts you can eat.

04:47.854 --> 04:49.947
What if I didn't pass?

04:49.989 --> 04:52.457
Well, then I'm still buying you a beer.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.857
Beer for losers.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.057
Grey, you're on cardio with Hahn today.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.291
- But...
- Stevens and Karev, pit.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.732
- Come on!
- Chief wants us to have a change.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.999
That's not a change.
I'm always stuck in the pit with Alex.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.269
When the Chief said, "Don't harangue
Dr. Bailey," what do you think he meant?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.708
- Yang, clinic.
- What? No. No!

05:10.743 --> 05:13.735
No, wait. The clinic is mine.
I say how it's staffed.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.247
- She'll ruin it.
- I'll ruin it.

05:15.281 --> 05:18.341
- Just let me do it.
- You will not. You will do what I say.

05:18.384 --> 05:21.785
Since Yang couldn't be bothered to
show up at the clinic since it opened,

05:21.821 --> 05:24.619
think of it as a new frontier
in her training.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.885
Sorry.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.723
You're not sorry.
You're psyched you got Hahn.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.195
- If not, you should be.
- She's terrifying.

05:31.230 --> 05:35.189
You give her unrealistic expectations
as to what a resident should be.

05:35.234 --> 05:38.670
Stay on top of the material. Don't
get warm and fuzzy. She hates that.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.400
Any questions, come and ask me.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.409
I'll be in the clinic putting
Band-Aids on whiners

05:43.443 --> 05:47.004
who don't have the balls to get
real injuries. Let's go. Come on.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.205
Here you go.

05:49.248 --> 05:52.684
I didn't read the diary.
I just found it and put it on the table.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.084
I would've read it.

05:54.120 --> 05:58.557
Every time I actually do something
to move into the house, she freaks out.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.420
What are you gonna do with the trailer?

06:02.862 --> 06:04.693
- No.
- Come on.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.098
Plus, there's a real possibility,
she kicks me out in a week.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.292
I'm not letting go of the trailer.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.999
Sutures, fecal impaction
and more sutures.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.668
- She'll do it.
- What do you mean "She'll do it?"

06:16.709 --> 06:20.236
You're good at boring, stupid crap.
You're like a specialist.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.810
Hi, I'm Dr. Stevens.
Looks like you need some stitches.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.083
- What happened?
- I have a cut.

06:29.122 --> 06:32.956
- How'd you get it?
- I threw a remote at him, OK?

06:32.992 --> 06:36.553
All he can do is watch television
or fall asleep like a dead person.

06:36.596 --> 06:39.156
- Honey.
- Don't "honey" me. I'm divorcing you.

06:39.198 --> 06:42.656
Soon as you stop bleeding from
your head we're going to a lawyer.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.633
- Ever been to Europe?
- Nope. Someday.

06:46.672 --> 06:51.234
Don't wait until you're retired. Can't
be bothered to look out the window.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.245
Six-month trip across the world.

06:53.279 --> 06:57.238
I've been waiting for it for 15 years.
He slept through the whole thing.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.410
- Marianne.
- Six continents.

06:59.452 --> 07:02.319
I worked for 30 years. I was very tired.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.381
Well, I'm tired, too,
of being married to somebody

07:05.425 --> 07:08.451
with no interest in the world,
so everybody's tired.

07:08.494 --> 07:11.588
I'm going to get coffee.
I assume this'll take forever?

07:11.631 --> 07:12.859
Probably.

07:21.007 --> 07:24.204
Your mouth always do that,
move to the side like that?

07:24.243 --> 07:25.505
Like what?

07:27.113 --> 07:30.480
- Mind if I run some tests?
- Whatever you want.

07:30.516 --> 07:31.608
Great.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.813
I may be wrong, but I think Mr. Grandy
has a neuro thing going on.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.881
Get him stitched up then up for a CT.

07:38.925 --> 07:39.949
OK.

07:41.727 --> 07:43.627
Give me that. Give it!

07:46.132 --> 07:51.434
Mr. Grandy. I'm Dr. Karev, and I
will be taking you up for your CT today.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.237
Duncan Paley, eight, recently
diagnosed with aortic valve disease

07:55.274 --> 07:58.801
from infectious endocarditis,
scheduled for a Ross procedure.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.405
- There's a note from his pediatrician.
- Duncan!

08:01.447 --> 08:03.642
- Duncan, get back here!
- Duncan!

08:08.221 --> 08:09.586
- Go!
- Sure.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.158
- Sorry. Duncan.
- Duncan! Duncan, come back here.

08:15.194 --> 08:18.857
- Duncan, you get down from there.
- Don't touch the fire alarm.

08:18.898 --> 08:21.230
I'm not having the surgery. No!

08:21.267 --> 08:23.292
- Come on, get down.
- I'm not doing it!

08:23.336 --> 08:25.201
- One, two, three...
- No!

08:25.238 --> 08:27.729
I think this is all
going to be OK if we just...

08:27.773 --> 08:29.570
Will you promise me no surgery?

08:31.711 --> 08:33.736
Promise me no surgery.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.976
I... We...
We can't really do that.

08:40.019 --> 08:44.752
<i>Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

08:44.790 --> 08:48.123
<i>Evacuate. This is an emergency.</i>

08:55.701 --> 08:59.467
Do we have this kid under control,
or do I have to call Social Services?

08:59.505 --> 09:02.440
- He won't do anything like that again.
- He better not.

09:02.475 --> 09:06.104
The ceiling fell last week.
I don't need a series of false alarms.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.340
This place looks ridiculous enough.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.817
- Keep the ankle-biter under control.
- I'll sedate him if I have to.

09:11.851 --> 09:14.342
Good. Bone up on your
pulmonary autografts.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.380
I don't want to spend the day bathed
in your ignorance and incompetence.

09:19.325 --> 09:22.294
- She hates me.
- What do you mean "we'll sedate him?"

09:22.328 --> 09:24.353
I was trying not to be warm and fuzzy.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.957
I don't mean sedate him,
I mean baby-sit him.

09:26.999 --> 09:31.493
It's your last day as an intern.
Think of how happy you'll be to move on.

09:34.273 --> 09:35.365
Hey.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.969
I'm gonna be in the OR until 7:00.
Is 8:00 too late for dinner?

09:39.011 --> 09:41.775
No, but if you need
to reschedule or cancel.

09:41.814 --> 09:45.181
Come on, are you kidding?
I made a reservation at Canto.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.310
I even gamed out an outfit.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.512
We are doing this.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.693
So Hahn is doing a Ross procedure,
and she thinks I'm a moron.

09:56.729 --> 10:00.631
It's called a pulmonary autograft.
She likes the technical names, OK?

10:00.666 --> 10:04.227
Tell her you're excited to watch her
harvest a pulmonary valve

10:04.270 --> 10:06.238
using her septal sparing technique.

10:06.272 --> 10:10.003
Cut too much of the septal muscle, the
patient won't be able to come off pump.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.738
- None of that is in the book.
- The key to the case.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.042
You'll sound like you've been
around the block.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.572
I can't believe I'm giving you
my best stuff.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.312
- Mwah!
- You don't deserve it.

10:19.819 --> 10:24.188
Dr. Yang, Mrs. Borsokowski
needs your loving attention.

10:24.223 --> 10:27.920
Redness, itching, inflammation: A rash.
You're giving me a rash.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.861
No! She's the mean one!
I don't want her.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.459
OK.

10:35.601 --> 10:37.933
- All right, what do we got?
- Take a look.

10:37.970 --> 10:41.929
- Thing's bigger than a baseball.
- Oh, wow, it's right behind his eyes.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.874
This'll be fun. Page Stevens.

10:43.909 --> 10:45.809
She left the guy with me.

10:47.046 --> 10:50.743
- She gave you the case?
- Yeah, well, Izzie felt bad for me.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.648
Figured this would cheer me up.

10:52.685 --> 10:55.313
In that case you'll help me
pull this thing out.

10:56.055 --> 10:57.488
Hey, Duncan.

10:58.391 --> 11:02.293
We're gonna put an IV in your arm
real quick, then you can go on playing.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.819
- What is it?
- A little tube we put in your arm.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.957
No. No, it's gonna hurt.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.900
- Come on, it's not gonna hurt.
- It's gonna hurt.

11:09.935 --> 11:15.567
It's a needle, it's gonna hurt.
But it's only for, what, three seconds?

11:15.608 --> 11:18.304
- I don't believe you.
- You don't believe me?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.904
Do you want me to prove it to you?
I'll prove it.

11:20.946 --> 11:22.743
I'll have Dr. Grey put one in me.

11:22.782 --> 11:25.649
This is a tourniquet.

11:25.685 --> 11:31.021
And you wrap it around your arm
so that your vein pops out.

11:31.057 --> 11:32.854
See? Like that.

11:32.892 --> 11:35.520
So now, the needle.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.552
That's the part that's gonna hurt.

11:38.297 --> 11:41.266
That goes in, and that's in...

11:42.768 --> 11:47.705
Hurting. That hurts, it hurts, and...

11:49.442 --> 11:50.807
It doesn't hurt anymore.

11:50.843 --> 11:55.610
Now that stuff, it goes into here.
Doesn't hurt at all.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.515
OK, I'll do it.

12:02.388 --> 12:06.415
- OK. I'll go get another IV kit.
- OK.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.886
Wow. You're really good at this.

12:10.696 --> 12:13.290
Oh, I was an airplane guy too
when I was his age.

12:13.332 --> 12:16.199
Us airplane guys,
we like to know how things work.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.736
I'm sorry about the alarm.

12:24.610 --> 12:25.907
I know.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.247
Move!

12:33.385 --> 12:35.478
They have the nerve to be indignant

12:35.521 --> 12:38.752
about how they're not allowed
to be on their specialties.

12:38.791 --> 12:43.023
They don't have specialties. They should
be grateful they're allowed in the...

12:43.062 --> 12:44.757
Are you listening to me?

12:47.900 --> 12:52.496
I'm going on a date with Erica Hahn
and, uh... that's awkward

12:52.538 --> 12:55.507
'cause, uh... she's a colleague

12:55.541 --> 13:00.137
and because she's an attending,
and because she's a she.

13:00.179 --> 13:03.910
And, uh, there's been kissing,
but, uh... no touching,

13:03.949 --> 13:07.248
and what if I'm not into it?
What if I'm horrible

13:07.286 --> 13:11.848
at all that stuff south...
of the border?

13:12.491 --> 13:15.119
'Cause I've never been
south of the border...

13:15.161 --> 13:16.458
...with a female.

13:16.495 --> 13:20.431
I mean, I've never even been
over the northern mountains,

13:20.466 --> 13:22.058
you know what I'm sayin'?

13:28.107 --> 13:30.473
We're gonna pretend this didn't happen.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.681
Mr. Grandy?

13:37.716 --> 13:41.117
- What are you doing in here?
- They admitted me.

13:41.153 --> 13:45.817
My new doctor, Dr. Karev,
said I have a huge tumor in my head.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.122
Have you seen my wife?

13:49.595 --> 13:50.960
Your new doctor?

13:52.865 --> 13:54.093
Somebody page me?

13:54.133 --> 13:56.693
I have a patient with
tenderness and erythema

13:56.735 --> 13:58.760
from her upper chest to her left arm.

13:58.804 --> 14:01.034
She needs irrigation and debridement.

14:01.073 --> 14:03.633
She said you may have to
amputate my arm.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.343
It's a simple rash.
It's probably dermatitis.

14:07.379 --> 14:10.610
But look how the skin is denuded.
Could be surgical, right?

14:10.649 --> 14:13.641
It's a rash. Go to Derm,
get a tube of CeraVe cream.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.314
Don't ever page me
to hustle a surgery again.

14:17.256 --> 14:20.350
It was supposed
to be done yesterday. Done!

14:20.392 --> 14:22.417
So exactly why did I walk into my OR

14:22.461 --> 14:26.557
and still see a massive, gaping hole
where the ceiling was supposed to be?

14:26.599 --> 14:30.194
You see Karev, get an 18-gauge needle
and shove it in his throat.

14:30.236 --> 14:33.933
I have cultivated a look that says
I'm not interested in personal problems.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.702
Can you morons not read that look,

14:35.741 --> 14:38.869
or have I lost the hang of it?
People are telling me problems!

14:38.911 --> 14:42.278
I don't give a crap about
your crushing workload or love life

14:42.314 --> 14:44.145
or your carpal tunnel syndrome.

14:44.183 --> 14:47.846
I care about is Mrs. Caruchi,
a 92-year-old woman no one can find!

14:51.957 --> 14:53.015
Hi.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.219
I'm Dr. Pepman. Can I help you?

14:55.261 --> 14:57.491
Uh, yeah, um...

14:57.529 --> 14:59.759
Where can I get some CeraVe cream?

14:59.798 --> 15:03.029
Um, our nurses look
like they're tied up.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.595
If you don't mind waiting
I can get it for you myself.

15:06.639 --> 15:10.075
- Water with raspberries while you wait?
- Uh, sure.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.443
Hi, Chris.

15:18.684 --> 15:21.710
Oh. Don't mind Chris.
He's our massage therapist.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.188
You're... a what?

15:24.223 --> 15:27.989
Our hands do such delicate work.
It's important they stay healthy.

15:28.027 --> 15:31.463
We have Chris on staff to work on us
when we have a spare moment.

15:33.465 --> 15:36.366
Every attending gets their hands
massaged at work?

15:36.402 --> 15:39.838
Oh, no. The dermatology attendings
have another therapist.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.136
Chris just works on the residents.

15:43.842 --> 15:47.471
- You're a resident?
- First year, and loving it.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.976
So I'll make an incision ear to ear
and peel down the face.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.149
I'll crack open his forehead,
pull the tumor right out.

15:59.191 --> 16:02.991
Keep an eye on the optic nerve.
Somebody twitches and this guy's blind.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.394
Which one of your roommates
will be assisting?

16:05.431 --> 16:08.525
- Karev.
- Oh, great.

16:09.335 --> 16:12.566
Dr. Shepherd, I want back on this case.
This is my patient.

16:12.604 --> 16:16.040
- Alex stole him from me...
- Dr. Stevens, in this hospital

16:16.075 --> 16:19.442
I'm not your roommate.
I don't give a crap about your problems.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.708
I have a resident.
I don't need another.

16:21.747 --> 16:25.308
The patient's in his room,
if you want to go over procedure.

16:27.586 --> 16:30.350
- Son of a bitch.
- Go cry to somebody who cares.

16:32.424 --> 16:35.291
This is my case. It isn't fair.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.557
Surgery's like the Wild West.

16:37.596 --> 16:40.326
You didn't get your claim
in Montana from the bank,

16:40.366 --> 16:44.302
you got it 'cause you put a fence and
shot the ass off anyone who walked by.

16:45.537 --> 16:48.165
Karev's a cowboy. You're not.

16:51.710 --> 16:55.476
We're gonna transect the great arteries
at the sinotubular ridge,

16:55.514 --> 16:59.974
use the autograft to replace the aortic
root, then attach a pulmonary homograft.

17:00.019 --> 17:04.046
You going to use septal sparing
technique for the pulmonary autograft?

17:04.089 --> 17:05.214
Yes. Why do you ask?

17:05.257 --> 17:09.819
If we cut too much of the septal muscle
we can't take the patient off the pump?

17:09.862 --> 17:10.886
Right.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.295
Always wanted to see
a septal sparing technique.

17:13.332 --> 17:16.768
Know how to reanastomose the coronary
arteries back to the aorta?

17:16.801 --> 17:17.928
I do.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.500
I'll let you sew part of it in.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.565
You'll be in there,
might as well get your hands dirty.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.577
Great. Thanks, Dr. Hahn.

17:26.478 --> 17:28.742
You're going to hell
'cause you're a liar.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.875
- Was it obvious?
- Unfortunately, no.

17:57.643 --> 17:58.803
What?

18:05.017 --> 18:07.986
- What happened?
- Look.

18:09.688 --> 18:10.780
You paged me 911.

18:10.823 --> 18:14.259
I'm in the middle of studying
for Hahn's pulmonary autograft...

18:16.695 --> 18:18.322
They're residents.

18:19.832 --> 18:23.928
That one baked a seven-layer cake
for that one's birthday, from scratch.

18:24.970 --> 18:29.373
And that one, that one's girlfriend
is taking him skiing this weekend.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.807
Oh, this one's the best.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.471
OK, this one gets to leave
to go get a facial.

18:34.313 --> 18:37.407
And she told her attending.
And her attending was happy

18:37.449 --> 18:40.612
'cause they have to have facials.
They're dermatologists.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.555
- I mean, look... look...
- Oh, my God.

18:44.590 --> 18:48.287
The hospital has hired someone
to rub them, full-time.

18:49.228 --> 18:53.494
I bet their boyfriends don't go digging
around in their closets without asking.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.556
Never.

18:55.434 --> 18:58.801
I told Hahn I knew how to do
a coronary artery reanastomosis.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.540
- You don't.
- I know.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.668
I looked it up, the kid's eight.
He's got tiny arteries.

19:05.711 --> 19:09.169
Know what? Snag me some
of those grapes there, I'll teach you.

19:09.214 --> 19:10.977
And then find Dr. Daisy Pepman.

19:11.016 --> 19:13.780
Ask her for a suture kit
and a 7-0 polypropylene.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.379
- Dr. Daisy Pepman?
- She's a resident.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.389
She pours fruity drinks.

19:18.423 --> 19:21.915
She has time for that kind of thing.
And I like saying her name.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.986
So was that hyphenated
or did her parents name her...?

19:25.030 --> 19:27.191
No... No mocking.

19:27.232 --> 19:31.726
There is no mocking in Derm.
Only warmth and light.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.269
Are you all right, Mrs. Paley?

19:37.910 --> 19:39.935
You want to know what Duncan's doing?

19:39.978 --> 19:43.812
Packing to leave, and I can't stop him.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.345
I suck at this.

19:46.385 --> 19:51.152
I'm tired and I'm fried because I lie
awake at night listening to him breathe

19:51.190 --> 19:54.557
because I'm afraid his heart's
gonna stop, and he's gonna die,

19:54.593 --> 19:57.994
and I'll have been sleeping.
I don't know how to do this.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.931
No one knows how to be the mom
of a kid with heart failure.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.558
Nobody teaches that.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.434
And you have a really smart kid,
you know that.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.968
We just need to
up our game a little bit.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.110
- Can I try?
- Go for it.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.778
- A baseball?
- Which is why you were so lethargic.

20:21.820 --> 20:25.119
Why I slept through
most of our trip, perhaps.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.816
Not because I am boring
and uninterested

20:28.860 --> 20:31.954
- in the cultures of the world.
- How was I supposed to know?

20:31.997 --> 20:34.864
You were supposed to give me
the benefit of the doubt,

20:34.900 --> 20:37.266
not throw electronics at me.

20:37.302 --> 20:41.238
Mr. Grandy, this is a massive tumor
in an area that's very hard to reach.

20:41.273 --> 20:44.106
You're gonna want to talk
about this with your wife.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.610
- I'm sure she's fine with the risks.
- Arnie.

20:46.645 --> 20:50.547
I'm going through with it.
I got nothing left to lose.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.749
See you in the OR.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.520
Dr. Shepherd, that is my patient.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.750
I'm sure you can use another resident...

20:58.790 --> 21:01.156
I am not the traffic cop
on the playground.

21:01.193 --> 21:04.822
It's the Wild West and you're
the sheriff. Can't you be the sheriff?

21:04.863 --> 21:06.524
I'll think of you when we crack
his forehead open.

21:06.565 --> 21:09.295
I'm not letting you do this to me.
Do not walk away.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.996
Give me back my surgery
or I'll shoot your ass off!

21:23.949 --> 21:26.179
He stole a very big surgery.

21:29.755 --> 21:30.881
I'll pick it up.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.194
- What'd you do with the diary?
- It's in my locker.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.026
Do you want me to screen it for you?

21:39.064 --> 21:43.467
- Magic Marker out all the scary parts.
- No. No one's reading it.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.026
OK, no. Don't. Here...

21:45.070 --> 21:48.198
Don't pull too hard.
You're stretching the skin.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.732
Alex stole my patient with a grapefruit
growing behind his eyes.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.802
Your boyfriend couldn't give a crap.

21:53.845 --> 21:56.541
He actually said the words,
"I don't give a crap."

21:56.581 --> 21:59.550
See that guy there, OK? He's a resident.

21:59.584 --> 22:03.680
He's dragging 'cause he got too much
sleep last night. Uh-huh. Too much.

22:04.256 --> 22:06.884
- What?
- Like watching a living freak show.

22:15.867 --> 22:17.494
I don't talk about sex.

22:17.536 --> 22:20.733
Please, let's just pretend
I never said even a single word.

22:20.772 --> 22:24.606
I don't talk about sex with anyone ever,
not any kind of sex.

22:24.643 --> 22:28.135
- Bailey, I am begging you...
- Uh!

22:35.987 --> 22:39.821
The vajayjay is undiscovered country.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.691
It is the motherland.

22:42.728 --> 22:48.360
You've never traveled there,
you don't know its customs and ways.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.369
Now me, I've always wanted
to go to Africa.

22:51.403 --> 22:55.100
But, if I go, I'm gonna
have to learn a few things first.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.005
I'm going to have to prepare.

22:57.042 --> 23:02.537
I'll need shots. Bring my own syringes
in case something goes wrong.

23:02.581 --> 23:05.175
And I'll want to know how to get
to the embassy...

23:05.217 --> 23:06.741
OK, now you've lost me.

23:10.088 --> 23:12.181
Just talk about it.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.851
Not with me, with the other one.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.796
Just talk about the rules,
the expectations,

23:19.831 --> 23:22.732
figure out how to gracefully demur

23:22.768 --> 23:27.000
if you find you don't like...
the local cuisine.

23:29.574 --> 23:33.203
In Ethiopia, they eat stew

23:33.245 --> 23:36.476
off of spongy sour bread.

23:39.050 --> 23:40.881
That's not for everyone.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.799
- Mer, I need you!
- Shh!

23:57.836 --> 24:00.600
- Harshing the vibe.
- What are you doing?

24:01.206 --> 24:05.267
Cristina found this magical world
where doctors are happy

24:05.310 --> 24:10.714
and patients are pleasant, and no one
is screaming or stealing surgeries.

24:10.749 --> 24:13.684
Everyone just
rubs each other all day long.

24:13.718 --> 24:17.279
You all want to be dermatologists?
They apply lotion for a living.

24:17.322 --> 24:21.122
Yeah. That's the point.
Come here, come here.

24:23.829 --> 24:27.128
They're empty inside,
completely devoid of blood lust.

24:27.165 --> 24:31.101
They don't need to fight for anything.
They don't want to cut anyone open.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.661
They just... love lotion.

24:34.406 --> 24:38.308
Do you know how much easier our life
would be if we could just love lotion?

24:39.277 --> 24:41.177
How do you think they got that way?

24:41.213 --> 24:44.444
Their mothers didn't leave diaries
around for them to read.

24:45.984 --> 24:50.546
Sloan told me today to stake my claim
in the Wild Wild West,

24:50.589 --> 24:54.685
so I went all cowboy on Alex's ass
and I still don't have my surgery.

24:55.594 --> 24:59.030
These women,
they do not have to stake a claim.

24:59.064 --> 25:02.295
OK. You all need to snap out of it.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.632
Izzie, in the Wild Wild West

25:04.669 --> 25:08.105
there is always a woman in the saloon
and nobody messes with her,

25:08.139 --> 25:11.108
- even though they all have guns.
- She's a prostitute.

25:11.142 --> 25:13.633
The woman in the saloon
is a whore, George.

25:13.678 --> 25:18.308
No. She just has other skills
she uses to make her way in the world.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.183
So just use what you got.

25:22.387 --> 25:24.321
Mer, I'm gonna take this,

25:24.356 --> 25:27.757
and I need you to help me
sell an idea to Hahn and the Chief.

25:29.094 --> 25:32.063
Cristina? You're coming, too.

25:33.164 --> 25:34.324
Cristina!

25:41.039 --> 25:42.700
How are you doing, Mr. Grandy?

25:42.741 --> 25:44.936
Well...

25:44.976 --> 25:49.879
...I've got a tumor that's been
compared to a baseball, a grapefruit,

25:49.915 --> 25:52.884
and an alien living inside my head,

25:52.918 --> 25:57.946
and... my wife,
who was ready to divorce me

25:57.989 --> 26:01.015
even before she knew
that I was damaged goods,

26:01.059 --> 26:02.822
she won't even look at me.

26:02.861 --> 26:06.558
I'm sure she's just freaked out
about the tumor. It happens a lot.

26:06.598 --> 26:08.293
What if it isn't just the tumor?

26:08.333 --> 26:13.236
I mean, what if she's figured out
that she just doesn't like me?

26:13.271 --> 26:16.968
No. You're a really likeable guy,
I can tell.

26:18.343 --> 26:19.367
You're a nice girl.

26:21.479 --> 26:26.109
Is... Is your new doctor
as nice as me? Dr. Karev?

26:26.151 --> 26:28.312
He's all right.

26:29.154 --> 26:31.714
That's good. Yeah.

26:32.691 --> 26:36.684
He was having some
personal problems, depression.

26:36.728 --> 26:39.322
He's been a little off his game, but...

26:40.565 --> 26:42.328
"Off his game?"

26:42.367 --> 26:44.995
Sounds like he's bouncing back.
You'll be fine.

26:45.036 --> 26:48.005
Wait. I don't want someone
who's "Off his game."

26:48.039 --> 26:51.702
Can I get you back?

26:51.743 --> 26:53.472
Oh, gee. Um, well...

26:54.713 --> 26:56.738
Well, you could talk to Dr. Shepherd,

26:56.781 --> 27:00.273
tell him you don't want Dr. Karev
on your case, then I'm all yours.

27:06.324 --> 27:08.986
- What happened?
- She said she was feeling faint.

27:09.027 --> 27:11.928
I thought she was pissed
about waiting for her cream.

27:11.963 --> 27:14.727
- Her pulse ox is 90?
- The oxygen's not helping.

27:14.766 --> 27:17.132
Get her to the ER.

27:17.168 --> 27:20.262
- Why didn't you move her to the ER?
- I don't know what to do.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.604
- You've been standing here?
- I paged you. Where've you been?

27:27.145 --> 27:30.012
OK. Aggressive fluids,
support care, steroids...

27:30.048 --> 27:32.573
- Give her 16 of dexamethasone.
- Right away.

27:34.586 --> 27:35.814
Hurry! Come on!

27:44.029 --> 27:47.430
BP's going back up.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.065
OK, um...

27:51.703 --> 27:55.070
Call Dr. Bailey and tell her
the patient needs plasmapheresis

27:55.106 --> 27:57.006
and a skin biopsy, stat.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.581
- You stole my surgery.
- It's my surgery.

28:05.617 --> 28:09.917
Using me as a doormat is one thing,
screwing with my career is another.

28:09.954 --> 28:14.323
I have been wiping your snot
and covering your ass for weeks now,

28:14.359 --> 28:16.054
and all you've done is abuse me.

28:16.094 --> 28:18.062
For a little while you get to do that

28:18.096 --> 28:22.226
because you're heartbroken and pathetic,
and I'm a good friend, but it ends.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.599
Get your own surgeries,
wipe your own snot.

28:24.636 --> 28:28.402
- Dr. Shepherd, that's my surgery.
- The patient made the request.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.271
Nothing I can do.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.908
Sixty percent of her skin sloughed off.

28:38.950 --> 28:41.885
I'm surprised she didn't crash
when she got out of bed.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.889
Dr. Sloan didn't catch it
when he was down for a consult?

28:44.923 --> 28:49.053
He may have been distracted by the fact
I told him it was necrotizing fasciitis.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.119
- That'd do it.
- Can I do the biopsy?

28:51.730 --> 28:55.359
Sure. I didn't know you had
a big interest in dermatology.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.732
No... I don't. Just the surgical part.

28:57.769 --> 29:00.033
That's all right. It's good. Branch out.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.335
Dr. Bailey,
I'm not interested in Derm...

29:04.109 --> 29:05.235
...atology.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.809
We're doing a bicoronal incision.
Expect a lot of bleeding.

29:09.848 --> 29:13.215
Once I get going it'll all happen fast,
so stay with me.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.014
Stevens, grab a Bovie.

29:17.722 --> 29:20.486
All right. Here we go.

29:39.410 --> 29:42.777
You are not bringing
an 8-year-old child into the OR.

29:42.814 --> 29:46.682
He's scared, doesn't know what's gonna
happen. No way for him to imagine it.

29:46.718 --> 29:49.312
Letting the boy see a bloody OR
isn't gonna help.

29:49.354 --> 29:52.221
Dr. Hahn has a thorascopic
lung resection in an hour.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.851
- Three tiny incisions, no blood.
- What's that gonna do?

29:54.893 --> 29:59.057
It shows him the room, the instruments,
someone under anesthesia, still alive.

29:59.097 --> 30:01.190
Pinning him down
and doping him up is...

30:01.232 --> 30:03.996
It's gonna be traumatic for him, and...

30:04.836 --> 30:07.396
Showing him how it works
is such an easy fix.

30:14.379 --> 30:16.347
- You can't see, can you?
- Nope.

30:21.386 --> 30:23.013
I don't want to go in there.

30:24.455 --> 30:25.820
Scared?

30:29.260 --> 30:33.390
Well, there's not gonna be any blood,
nothing gross, nothing scary.

30:33.431 --> 30:38.334
Just three tiny cuts that are so small
you can barely see 'em.

30:44.008 --> 30:48.377
The first time that I went in there,
that room, I was scared.

30:49.414 --> 30:52.178
But that room is the most
magical room in the world.

30:52.217 --> 30:54.481
Only the finest doctors
get to go in there.

30:54.519 --> 30:58.853
A lot of the great ones are not even
allowed to touch anything, just watch.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.654
I'm pretty good, so I'm still a watcher.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.856
The people that work in there,
they're the best.

31:05.563 --> 31:06.996
The very best.

31:07.832 --> 31:11.791
It's the safest place you'll ever be in
in your entire life.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.083
Where'd that guy's face go?

31:30.655 --> 31:33.283
- You lost, O'Malley?
- Sorry!

31:33.324 --> 31:37.226
No, wait! I want to see! I want to see
the guy with no face! Stop! Stop!

31:38.763 --> 31:42.756
Promise not to mention this to anyone,
I'll give you what you want for life.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.165
- OK?
- OK.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.969
Good afternoon, Duncan.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.269
Come on in and take a look.

31:57.382 --> 32:01.318
- I want to go back to the other one.
- We're not talking about the other one.

32:01.352 --> 32:04.219
- This one's boring.
- Well, yours will be boring too.

32:07.725 --> 32:10.853
- Do I get the big lights?
- Yeah. You get all the big lights.

32:10.895 --> 32:13.295
- Where's the suctioner?
- Right over there.

32:13.331 --> 32:15.697
Can I feel it?
I just want to feel it once.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.226
Move over first.

32:21.205 --> 32:23.002
Can I touch the scalpel?

32:23.041 --> 32:26.841
- You just need to lie down.
- I just want to see everything.

32:29.314 --> 32:31.077
- Look here. See this?
- Yeah.

32:31.115 --> 32:35.245
It's a video camera. You'll be able
to watch the whole thing when it's over.

32:35.286 --> 32:38.449
- Start shooting right now.
- Lie down.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.316
See you after surgery.

32:44.595 --> 32:46.756
OK, don't squeeze too hard.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.562
The teeth on the forceps
can leave holes.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.090
That's good.

32:52.537 --> 32:54.562
Very good. Keep going on that plane.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.202
Great. OK, let me take over.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.583
Cowboys don't have friends.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.623
Dr. Grey, you ready?

33:14.659 --> 33:17.992
Have good visualization
and start suturing right here.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.295
All right. Keep going.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.132
Very nice.

33:26.170 --> 33:29.139
All right.
Give her a little room, O'Malley.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.265
OK.

33:30.908 --> 33:32.102
Beautiful.

33:32.143 --> 33:36.443
You can tell Dr. Yang she's a better
teacher than I would've thought.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.312
- Sorry.
- Save it.

33:40.151 --> 33:43.985
Your colleagues know more than you do,
milk them for all they're worth.

33:44.022 --> 33:47.651
Lie to me again about your experience,
the next heart you see will be your own

33:47.692 --> 33:50.217
as I cut it out of your chest
with a steak knife.

33:56.467 --> 33:59.630
Mrs. Grandy,
your husband is in recovery.

33:59.670 --> 34:02.764
It was a tough procedure,
but overall it went really well.

34:05.943 --> 34:08.172
He's gonna be OK, Mrs. Grandy.

34:08.746 --> 34:10.714
He is never gonna forgive me.

34:11.315 --> 34:15.978
He was sick, and I told him
he was lazy and boring.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.181
He was sick. You didn't know.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.815
Well, I'm his wife. I should've known.

34:26.964 --> 34:31.060
People are terrible to the people
they love sometimes.

34:32.036 --> 34:33.400
They're mean.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.996
You were both going through
a really hard time

34:37.041 --> 34:40.737
and took it out on one another.
It isn't fun, but it is what people do.

34:41.846 --> 34:44.371
It doesn't make you
the worst wife in the world.

34:44.415 --> 34:47.612
It just makes you a person
who made a mistake.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.170
I miss anything good?

35:11.209 --> 35:14.701
You're gonna love this. The redhead
just gave the short one a case

35:14.745 --> 35:18.909
because she thought he'd find it
interesting. A pyogenic granuloma.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.508
Gave it away.

35:20.551 --> 35:22.644
We could transfer.

35:22.687 --> 35:26.680
- Maybe we'd be happier.
- We'd die of boredom.

35:26.724 --> 35:28.021
Die with great skin.

35:29.227 --> 35:32.321
I had the biggest derm emergency
that exists today,

35:32.363 --> 35:35.799
and it was fun for about a minute,
'cause the woman almost died,

35:35.833 --> 35:38.859
then we saved her, and all
she needed was a stupid biopsy.

35:38.903 --> 35:43.101
- I tore a guy's face off.
- I reattached a coronary artery.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.632
I hate you both.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.039
We are not happy, glowy, people.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.572
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:52.617 --> 35:54.676
We gotta get out of here.

35:54.719 --> 35:56.380
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:59.056 --> 36:00.648
Still no word on the test?

36:02.260 --> 36:04.694
- George, I'm sure you passed.
- It'll be OK.

36:04.729 --> 36:08.221
I mean, you're gonna buy me a beer
tonight, and then it'll be OK.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.124
O'Malley?

36:10.668 --> 36:13.102
Test results.

36:26.284 --> 36:27.649
You passed.

36:28.819 --> 36:32.482
- I passed?
- George, you're not an intern anymore.

36:35.226 --> 36:37.717
- I passed.
- We are so gonna celebrate.

36:37.762 --> 36:39.992
I passed. I passed.

36:41.499 --> 36:45.595
I passed. I'm gonna...
I gotta go tell Izzie and Mer.

36:45.636 --> 36:48.730
- No. Go tell them, and then we'll...
- OK.

36:56.347 --> 36:57.746
Huzzah!

36:57.782 --> 36:59.841
To George O'Malley, repeater no more.

36:59.884 --> 37:04.116
- You're gonna be impossible now.
- Lexie!

37:04.155 --> 37:06.817
- Come on and join us.
- I'm gonna get a drink first.

37:08.993 --> 37:11.962
- Hey, Joe, could I have a beer?
- Sure.

37:11.996 --> 37:15.625
- Want me to bring it to the table?
- No. I'm just gonna sit over there.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.565
Hey, Joe, can I get another vodka tonic?

37:24.675 --> 37:26.506
George passed his exam.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.345
Tool.

37:33.050 --> 37:36.486
Just the people I was looking for.
I want to buy these two a drink.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.182
- You're the best roommate ever.
- I am.

37:39.223 --> 37:42.659
Just to be clear, you two pull that crap
on one of my cases again,

37:42.693 --> 37:44.888
I will have you
thrown out of the program.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.972
You know what?
I'll take my drink at the table...

38:03.014 --> 38:05.414
I know, OK? I know I'm being an ass.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.344
I can't help it.
I'm pissed off all the time,

38:09.387 --> 38:11.150
so much I can't even breathe.

38:11.188 --> 38:14.157
You can't be pissed at
a crazy chick for losing her mind.

38:14.191 --> 38:16.819
There's nobody else
to be pissed at except you.

38:18.195 --> 38:19.685
Nobody else.

38:42.553 --> 38:44.248
We need to have rules.

38:45.589 --> 38:47.284
- What?
- Rules.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.624
We need rules about how we're
gonna deal with the motherland,

38:50.661 --> 38:55.189
because it's
undiscovered country, and...

38:56.033 --> 39:00.129
...maybe it'll be the best vacation
either of us has ever had,

39:00.171 --> 39:03.470
but... it's mysterious

39:03.507 --> 39:06.738
and dark, and there should be rules.

39:07.978 --> 39:09.946
Oh, and an embassy.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.414
And a safe word.

39:15.119 --> 39:18.486
I'm sorry. What the hell
are you talking about?

39:19.190 --> 39:21.021
Below the...

39:21.058 --> 39:24.755
Below the Mason-Dixon line.
Of your pants.

39:28.933 --> 39:31.026
I'm not sure I'm ready to go there.

39:34.271 --> 39:35.829
Me neither.

39:38.676 --> 39:43.443
There's lots of undiscovered territory
above the belt. Uh...

39:43.481 --> 39:45.642
We can take it slow.

39:45.683 --> 39:50.711
Maybe... just first base.

39:53.624 --> 39:55.592
OK.

39:55.626 --> 39:58.026
Whoo! OK. Thank you.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.461
Sorry.

40:00.498 --> 40:02.728
Finish my wine.

40:03.968 --> 40:05.595
I'm gonna look at the menu

40:05.636 --> 40:08.867
while you let your blood pressure
drop back down to normal.

40:12.476 --> 40:13.500
Erica.

40:18.516 --> 40:20.711
Maybe second base, too.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.860
I could always move back to the trailer.

40:41.505 --> 40:43.473
No, I want you here.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.712
I mean, I may not always be
so graceful about it, but...

40:50.214 --> 40:51.772
...I want you here.

40:52.883 --> 40:54.908
You need a place for your things.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.318
It's not an unreasonable request.

40:58.889 --> 41:02.188
You can use this as your den
or your office or whatever.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.523
It's your mom's den.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.596
But she isn't here. You are.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.137
What about you?

41:26.717 --> 41:28.548
You need someplace.

41:28.586 --> 41:30.486
Someplace you can get away to.

41:31.455 --> 41:34.356
Well, I can always go
to Cristina's or whatever.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.559
I think I have a better idea.

41:37.595 --> 41:39.688
<i>We like</i>
<i>to think we're fearless,</i>

41:39.730 --> 41:43.291
<i>eager to explore unknown lands</i>
<i>and soak up new experiences.</i>

41:43.334 --> 41:45.962
<i>But, the fact is,</i>
<i>we're always terrified.</i>

41:46.003 --> 41:48.369
<i>Maybe the terror's</i>
<i>part of the attraction.</i>

41:48.405 --> 41:51.897
<i>Some people go to horror movies,</i>
<i>we cut things open,</i>

41:51.942 --> 41:53.705
<i>dive into dark water.</i>

"October 13, 1977.

41:57.948 --> 42:00.508
I haven't slept in three days..."

42:00.551 --> 42:04.453
<i>And, at the end of the day,</i>
<i>isn't that what you'd rather hear about,</i>

42:04.488 --> 42:08.049
<i>if you've got one drink</i>
<i>and one friend and 45 minutes?</i>

42:09.293 --> 42:11.386
<i>Smooth rides make for boring stories.</i>

42:11.428 --> 42:14.261
<i>A little calamity,</i>
<i>that's worth talking about.</i>
