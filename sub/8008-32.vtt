It's stressing me out

09:08.649 --> 09:10.448
that there's food
on a blanket!

09:10.450 --> 09:12.117
I have to go home.
This was nice.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.752
You're running away
from intimacy!

09:13.754 --> 09:16.988
You don't know
you'd get hurt!

09:16.990 --> 09:18.924
Tiny?
What are you doing?

09:18.926 --> 09:21.660
I could not go through
with my vengeance.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.795
It wouldn't have
accomplished anything.

09:23.797 --> 09:27.098
Also, you and your brother are
really sweet together.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.035
You're hard to track.
But okay!

09:33.105 --> 09:34.639
We'll get down
ourselves, guys.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.241
Don't even sweat it!

09:39.612 --> 09:41.613
But, yeah,
let's hang out sometime.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.081
I'm getting a phone soon.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.516
Bye!

09:44.518 --> 09:46.251
Ready to go home?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.225
[ Whoosh! ]

09:58.965 --> 09:59.998
Whoa, dang.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.466
Normal Man:
Oh, the people of Mars

10:01.468 --> 10:03.168
are gonna be so glad
to see you.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.537
It really feels good to be good,
you know?

10:05.539 --> 10:07.505
Maybe that's
my new catchphrase.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.107
I don't know.
Is that dumb?

10:09.109 --> 10:12.978
It's a good catchphrase.
You'll do okay up there.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.680
Ahh! [ Gasps ]
Glob, what are you doing?!

10:15.682 --> 10:20.485
My days of ruling Mars are over,
but you got this, man.

10:20.487 --> 10:23.688
All right. Well...

10:24.490 --> 10:26.324
Oh, my gob.
Where were you?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.994
I was with Normal Man.
He's cool now.

10:28.996 --> 10:32.130
Whaaaaa?
I don't bElieve it.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.669
[ All groaning ]

10:37.671 --> 10:40.705
[ Door clanks ]

10:41.707 --> 10:43.208
Hey, guys. I'm back.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.342
All: Magic Man!

10:44.344 --> 10:46.344
-Oh! He came back!
-Oh, I can't bElieve it!

10:46.346 --> 10:48.313
It's okay. Calm down.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.547
Calm down?!

10:49.549 --> 10:52.217
You turned me
into a giant starfish!

10:52.219 --> 10:54.919
You turned me into a barrel
of flaming garbage!

10:54.921 --> 10:57.088
What horrible trick
do you have planned now?

10:57.090 --> 11:00.058
I don't really
do tricks anymore.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.092
Hmm.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.460
Okay.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.461
Here's a trick.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.629
It's a hat

11:04.631 --> 11:06.998
but inside it are...

11:07.000 --> 11:08.867
brownies!

11:08.869 --> 11:11.469
I want to eat
those brownies.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.171
It's a start.

11:15.307 --> 11:19.477
Come along with me

11:19.479 --> 11:23.615
And the butterflies and bees
