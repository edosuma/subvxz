00:00.252 --> 00:02.020
<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:02.153 --> 00:04.920
The Secret Service thinks
it's my responsibility.

00:04.955 --> 00:06.535
That all this is my fault.

00:06.570 --> 00:08.054
Angela needs to confess.

00:08.089 --> 00:10.274
- Admit you made a mistake.
- But I didn't.

00:10.309 --> 00:11.753
You killed her!

00:11.788 --> 00:14.276
No. Angela's death is on you.

00:14.311 --> 00:15.930
Did you find out who he is?

00:15.965 --> 00:18.468
His name is Carlisle.
He's an FBI Agent.

00:18.503 --> 00:22.257
Sometimes you have to do
a bad thing for a good reason.

00:22.292 --> 00:24.864
- How's she doing today?
- The chemo's hard on your wife.

00:24.899 --> 00:28.435
But she always looks a little more
peaceful to me after your visits.

00:28.911 --> 00:31.480
Everything's gonna go back
just the way it was.

00:32.390 --> 00:34.962
You're gonna implant
a GPS chip into everyone.

00:34.997 --> 00:37.006
Think of it as an invisible leash.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.622
You do everything he wants,
he's still going to kill us.

00:39.757 --> 00:41.587
How'd you get out of the hospital?
Aren't they watching you?

00:41.622 --> 00:44.233
I slipped away.
Made them think I was in surgery.

00:44.849 --> 00:46.261
Can you do it again?

00:46.296 --> 00:47.916
I think so. Why?

00:47.951 --> 00:50.911
- We're going to escape.
- It's not that simple to just run away.

00:50.946 --> 00:53.482
- I'll act as a decoy.
- No. I'm not leaving you here.

00:53.517 --> 00:55.419
It's dangerous, forget it.
I won't do it.

00:55.454 --> 00:56.935
You know I love you, right?

00:56.970 --> 00:58.242
Of course.

00:58.277 --> 01:00.398
- I'm having an affair.
- What?

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.905 --> 01:20.758
So, you're ready to do this?

01:20.793 --> 01:22.380
I need more time to think.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.832
- We don't have time.
- What if the plan doesn't work?

01:23.867 --> 01:25.766
What's the alternative?

01:25.801 --> 01:28.721
Think about it.
They didn't expect this to happen.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.423
There're four of them in the house.

01:30.505 --> 01:33.321
They can't watch
all of us for two weeks.

01:33.356 --> 01:34.973
They're improvising.

01:35.008 --> 01:37.394
The longer we wait,
the harder it will get.

01:37.396 --> 01:40.296
We have to go now.
We have to escape.

01:41.015 --> 01:43.317
- Don't let him break your spirit.
- I'm not broken.

01:43.319 --> 01:45.635
I'm just calculating risk.

01:45.637 --> 01:48.155
Well, calculate the risk
of not doing anything.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.457
For this plan to work,
all you have to do

01:50.459 --> 01:52.826
is get out of the hospital
like you did yesterday.

01:53.911 --> 01:57.814
- What about you?
- I'll keep up like everything's normal.

01:57.816 --> 02:01.150
Draw their attention while you escape.

02:01.269 --> 02:04.014
And then I'll get away,
when you're clear.

02:04.022 --> 02:05.173
How? How will you get away?

02:05.208 --> 02:08.342
Look, don't worry about me, all right?
I'll catch up to you.

02:08.344 --> 02:10.509
But for this to work,
somebody has to distract them.

02:10.512 --> 02:14.214
- I'm the one they want, I should...
- No. This is on me.

02:15.883 --> 02:18.151
I know why you're doing this.

02:18.236 --> 02:22.038
I'm not doing it because of the affair.
It was meaningless.

02:22.090 --> 02:23.690
I don't want to talk about that now.

02:24.008 --> 02:25.225
(SIGHS)

02:28.196 --> 02:31.181
I'm doing this because
I love my family.

02:32.867 --> 02:35.133
Because I love you.

02:43.527 --> 02:46.696
REALTOR: Well, you couldn't ask
for a better home.

02:47.499 --> 02:52.669
Five bedroom. Four bath.
Open floor plan. Updates throughout.

02:52.671 --> 02:54.037
Brand new kitchen.

02:54.039 --> 02:57.640
And this is in the highly coveted
Yorktown school district.

02:58.142 --> 02:59.976
I love all the trees out back.

02:59.978 --> 03:02.512
It's a bit pricey,
especially in this market.

03:02.514 --> 03:05.232
Well, that backyard
alone is over an acre.

03:05.234 --> 03:08.317
Totally private.
Very safe neighborhood.

03:08.820 --> 03:11.070
Why don't I give you a minute?

03:13.908 --> 03:15.759
This is the house we dreamed about

03:15.800 --> 03:17.979
when we lived in that tiny studio
in med school.

03:18.063 --> 03:20.781
I miss the view
of the giant green dumpster.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.355
It's perfect.

03:22.433 --> 03:24.828
Can't you just see you and Jake
throwing the football around?

03:24.863 --> 03:26.870
Lacrosse, okay?
He's gonna play lacrosse.

03:26.872 --> 03:28.226
Let's make a bid.

03:28.265 --> 03:30.875
All right,
but you have to stop smiling.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.218
Why?

03:32.254 --> 03:35.101
Because it makes it impossible
to negotiate.

03:35.136 --> 03:37.647
Okay, but I do not
want to lose this place.

03:37.715 --> 03:39.683
I won't. I promise.

03:44.355 --> 03:45.468
(DINGING)

03:45.548 --> 03:47.058
What are you doing?

03:47.975 --> 03:50.026
Baking muffins.

03:50.728 --> 03:54.063
I'm just following your rules,
pretending like everything's normal.

03:55.450 --> 03:57.567

04:00.621 --> 04:03.041
(WINCING)
I need my med kit.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.915
I know you guys took it away, but...

04:04.927 --> 04:07.461
- How bad is it? Let me see.
- No, it's just a little burn.

04:07.463 --> 04:09.262
Get it.

04:19.923 --> 04:21.808
Here, let me do that.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.314
(WINCING)

04:33.938 --> 04:35.572
Thank you.

04:42.697 --> 04:46.082
Jake! Morgan!
We're leaving in five.

04:46.834 --> 04:48.034
Ellen?

04:50.455 --> 04:52.271
You okay?

04:57.862 --> 05:01.330
- Bye.
- Hey, hey! Hold up a sec.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.020
Come here.

05:08.005 --> 05:09.689
How you feeling?

05:10.191 --> 05:11.991
Awesome.

05:12.510 --> 05:13.833
I'm sorry about yesterday.

05:13.838 --> 05:16.781
I should have listened to what
you were trying to tell me.

05:17.148 --> 05:20.566
- How's your bruise?
- I'm fine. So...

05:20.868 --> 05:26.639
Look. It's my job to protect you.

05:27.041 --> 05:30.293
I should've done that.
That's what fathers do.

05:30.361 --> 05:31.994
Can I go now?

05:34.048 --> 05:37.317
- Where's your sister?
- She's already in the car.

05:39.036 --> 05:40.870
Well...

05:42.039 --> 05:44.273
Tell her I love her.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.310
(SIGHING)

05:58.573 --> 06:00.473
We're leaving.

06:00.908 --> 06:02.909
Escaping. Today.

06:03.277 --> 06:05.194
Don't look.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.690
- Where are we gonna go?
- Canada.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.605
We need to get far away.
Their people are everywhere.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.955
The FBI. The Secret Service.
We can't trust anyone.

06:15.036 --> 06:16.930
Only each other.

06:16.941 --> 06:20.276
Now go to your class.
Don't let them know anything's wrong.

06:20.312 --> 06:22.829
And then, after lunch,
you slip away.

06:22.847 --> 06:24.916
Wait, it's not that easy.

06:24.933 --> 06:28.687
You are resourceful and smart,
and I know you can do this.

06:29.770 --> 06:32.137
You have to.

06:32.290 --> 06:34.724
I'll meet you at the bus station
on Glebe at 2:00 p.m.

06:34.726 --> 06:36.726
We're taking the 2:45 bus
to Montreal.

06:36.728 --> 06:38.747
Mom, they're gonna find us!

06:38.752 --> 06:42.269
We have GPS chips in our backs,
remember?

06:49.240 --> 06:50.707
Cut them out.

Angela?

07:39.079 --> 07:42.165
- I know what's going on.
- Know what?

07:42.184 --> 07:44.662
I mean, I'm not supposed
to say anything,

07:44.732 --> 07:47.896
but, they talked to me about you.

07:50.291 --> 07:54.544
The Secret Service!
You're operating on the President?

07:54.546 --> 07:56.679
(WHISPERING) I know!
It's unbelievable, right?

07:56.681 --> 07:58.568
I mean, just don't forget about us,
the little people,

07:58.605 --> 08:00.646
when they make you Surgeon General.

08:00.719 --> 08:02.185
I hope they didn't grill you too much.

08:02.187 --> 08:04.804
I didn't realize this whole process
was gonna be so intense.

08:04.806 --> 08:07.690
Please. It is a pleasure telling them
how amazing you are.

08:07.692 --> 08:10.759
- Even if every word's a lie.
- (LAUGHING)

08:10.828 --> 08:14.997
Well, look, uh, there's another
reason they talked to you.

08:15.866 --> 08:20.603
I told them I want you
to be a part of my surgical team.

08:20.605 --> 08:22.104
- Shut up.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.107
Thank you so much!

08:35.085 --> 08:37.953
Okay, we have less than six hours
to get out of here and meet Mom.

08:37.955 --> 08:40.102
The sooner we cut out
the GPS chips, the better.

08:40.176 --> 08:43.760
- Oh, God, I'm gonna puke.
- Just, calm down. Just...

08:43.761 --> 08:48.298
go to your class, take your Bio test,
and try to act normal.

08:48.366 --> 08:52.151
- Mom said we need the iodine bandages.
- I'll take care of it.

08:52.153 --> 08:55.437
- And how are we gonna get off campus?
- I'll figure it out.

08:55.490 --> 08:58.741
Meet me at 10:30, third period,
at the supply shed.

08:58.776 --> 09:03.062
- Why all the way over there?
- Because it's empty and private.

09:03.147 --> 09:06.281
And no one will hear you
in case you scream.

09:13.674 --> 09:15.157
Hurt yourself?

09:15.159 --> 09:17.409
It's nothing. I scraped it getting
some gear out of the van.

09:17.447 --> 09:20.403
Okay. If that's the way
you want to play it.

09:21.148 --> 09:25.899
- Play what?
- I think he likes me.

09:32.359 --> 09:35.878
You're on Brian.
I have to go to see Nina at the hospital.

09:35.913 --> 09:38.551
- How's she doing?
- We spoke last night.

09:38.583 --> 09:39.923
She said if I didn't come see her today,

09:39.996 --> 09:42.355
she was going to have sex
with her oncologist.

09:43.737 --> 09:46.139
That sounds more like her.
She must be feeling better.

09:48.292 --> 09:49.959
Tell her I love her.

09:50.594 --> 09:52.478
I will.

09:58.135 --> 09:59.975
Here are copies of the loan docs

10:00.015 --> 10:02.651
and your safety deposit box,
Mr. Sanders.

10:02.673 --> 10:04.807
I can't believe I lost my key.

10:05.676 --> 10:07.643
Too many plates spinning.

10:08.729 --> 10:11.881
Also, I'd like to withdraw
$9,000 from my checking.

10:11.883 --> 10:14.151
WOMAN:
I can take care of that.

10:17.554 --> 10:21.441
There's a hold on your account.
It must be some mistake, let me check.

10:21.443 --> 10:24.234
It's all right, just withdraw it
from the savings.

10:24.295 --> 10:28.347
No, there's a hold on that, too.
All of your accounts are frozen.

10:28.349 --> 10:32.869
- Are you sure? Can you tell me why?
- No, I'll call my supervisor.

10:32.871 --> 10:36.589
That's okay. That's okay, I'll,
um, I'll sort it out later.

10:38.742 --> 10:40.242
Can I have an envelope?

10:45.666 --> 10:47.750
You were in there
an awful long time.

10:49.436 --> 10:51.721
- What's in your jacket?
- Nothing.

10:58.946 --> 11:00.746

11:00.982 --> 11:05.935
It's gonna be a long, boring day.
Meetings. Lacrosse practice.

11:13.528 --> 11:15.255
Hey.
Uh, they need you in the gym.

11:15.347 --> 11:18.347
Somebody twisted their ankle.
They want you to take a look.

11:18.349 --> 11:19.882
Okay. Thanks, Morgan.

11:51.915 --> 11:53.332
What are you doing?

11:53.468 --> 11:55.990
I... just needed something
for my stomach.

11:56.025 --> 11:58.053
Why didn't you ask me?

11:58.122 --> 12:01.323
I forgot... I just...
thought I'd get it myself.

12:02.443 --> 12:06.399
You know, you came in here last
week complaining of nausea, Morgan.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.312
Probably just a stomach virus.

12:08.349 --> 12:10.955
You sure there's nothing else
going on with you?

12:14.805 --> 12:16.722
You're not pregnant, are you?

12:17.674 --> 12:18.841
No!

12:19.210 --> 12:23.345
- You can tell me the truth.
- I'm fine. There's nothing to tell.

12:24.331 --> 12:27.116
Okay, let me get you
something for your nausea.

12:28.518 --> 12:32.154
You know, if you were pregnant,
you'd need to take care of yourself.

12:32.156 --> 12:37.460
Obviously, no alcohol.
Prenatal vitamins. Folic acid.

12:38.178 --> 12:41.030
- And no stress.
- Thanks, but it's just the flu.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.267

I promise.

13:35.303 --> 13:37.353
I'll bring this back to you
when I'm done, okay?

13:37.355 --> 13:39.472
- Maybe she can call the office line.
- Yeah, all right. Thank you.

13:39.474 --> 13:41.057
- Hey.
- Did you get the passports?

13:41.059 --> 13:43.526
Yeah, but I couldn't get the cash,
they froze our bank accounts.

13:43.528 --> 13:46.646
- What? How?
- He's FBI, Ellen.

13:46.648 --> 13:48.314
It doesn't take much these days.

13:48.316 --> 13:50.700
We need cash for tickets, hotels, food.

13:50.702 --> 13:52.451
I'll figure something out.
Now, listen,

13:52.453 --> 13:55.554
I'm going to leave everything for you
in my desk at the Hellman building.

13:55.556 --> 13:57.272
It's five blocks away
from the bus station.

13:57.274 --> 14:00.293
Yes, but Brian, they're watching you.
They're gonna follow you there.

14:00.295 --> 14:01.761
They won't.
I'll make sure of it.

14:01.763 --> 14:03.696
(BEEPER BUZZING)
I gotta get to surgery.

14:03.798 --> 14:07.333
The cash, the passports,
they'll be in my desk.

14:07.335 --> 14:08.884
Okay, I gotta go.

14:11.822 --> 14:13.806
Good to see you out of that gown.

14:14.424 --> 14:17.376
I can still open
my own bottles, Duncan.

14:18.012 --> 14:19.751
It's such a beautiful day.

14:19.823 --> 14:21.688
We should move this outside
and have a picnic.

14:22.933 --> 14:25.253
It's not a good idea.
Your immune system's weak.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.875
You need to be patient.

14:26.971 --> 14:30.272
Patient. I've been nothing but
patient for the last six months.

14:32.642 --> 14:34.994
So, I got a call from Miss Jones.

14:35.029 --> 14:36.531
Apparently,

14:36.566 --> 14:39.804
Sawyer got into a fight with Danica Barry
at school yesterday.

14:39.834 --> 14:43.683
- That little snot probably deserved it.
- She stole Sawyer's thermos.

14:43.771 --> 14:45.888
Did you arrest her?

14:46.257 --> 14:48.020
You know, I thought about it,

14:48.060 --> 14:50.703
but I had a hard time
getting a warrant.

14:51.011 --> 14:52.595
(LAUGHING)

14:52.663 --> 14:58.167
Oh, she wanted me
to show you this picture.

14:58.986 --> 15:01.423
She was very proud of herself...

15:12.566 --> 15:14.900
I'm gonna stop the chemo.

15:14.902 --> 15:18.521
- What?
- I talked about it with Dr. Suresh, um...

15:18.790 --> 15:22.124
The leukemia is still not in remission.
It's not working.

15:22.126 --> 15:24.843
So... I'm gonna stop.

15:28.999 --> 15:31.517
Don't you think I should
be part of this discussion?

15:31.519 --> 15:34.086
This is the discussion.

15:34.088 --> 15:36.155
Sounded more like a declaration.

15:36.223 --> 15:37.807
Duncan, we've tried everything.

15:37.809 --> 15:39.575
No. We haven't.

15:41.078 --> 15:42.895
You'll get through this.

15:44.514 --> 15:46.582
We'll get through this.

15:47.984 --> 15:52.387
I want to enjoy my life.
Now. While I still can.

15:53.073 --> 15:55.257
I'm missing everything.

15:57.511 --> 16:00.370
Sawyer will get in more fights.

16:00.914 --> 16:02.510
That's easy for you to say,

16:02.547 --> 16:05.787
you're there with her,
and I'm stuck in here.

16:08.638 --> 16:11.841
Look, I want her to remember me
as her mother.

16:12.093 --> 16:16.796
As a real person, not somebody
wasting away in a hospital.

16:18.949 --> 16:21.416
I need to get out of here.

16:36.967 --> 16:39.318
You stealing petty cash?

16:40.137 --> 16:41.731
Things that tough?

16:41.853 --> 16:43.945
If you own the company,
do you call it stealing?

16:43.980 --> 16:45.574
In my opinion, absolutely.

16:45.576 --> 16:47.960
There's only $70 here.
Do you have any more?

16:48.745 --> 16:51.257
You do know this is for
office supplies, right?

16:51.292 --> 16:55.050
I left my wallet at home.
Gotta go to lunch.

16:58.455 --> 17:02.675
Three hundred. Put it back tomorrow
or I'll have to tell my boss.

17:03.894 --> 17:06.262
- (WHISPERING) Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:12.402 --> 17:14.153
I'll give you 500 bucks.

17:14.604 --> 17:16.722
It's worth 6,000. At least.

17:16.763 --> 17:18.041
Today, it's worth 500.

17:18.045 --> 17:21.137
Princess cuts don't move like
they did in 1999, sweetheart.

17:23.813 --> 17:25.531
You want to sell it or not?

17:52.105 --> 17:54.073
(PHONE RINGING)
(SIGHS)

17:55.359 --> 17:57.326
- Hello?
- Just checkin' in.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.895
Wanted to see how
my favorite doctor's doing.

17:59.897 --> 18:03.099
- Everything is fine.
- I see you finally got out of surgery.

18:03.567 --> 18:06.252
- How'd it go?
- Do you really care?

18:07.771 --> 18:09.505
I'll be talking to you.

18:19.383 --> 18:21.133
- BRIAN: Hey.
- Hey.

18:22.285 --> 18:24.271
Dinner's gonna be ready in 10 minutes.

18:24.308 --> 18:27.310
- How was your day?
- Great, actually.

18:27.391 --> 18:30.119
You'll never believe
where I was today...

18:32.045 --> 18:33.879
The White House.

18:36.650 --> 18:40.996
- Are you serious? You got the job?
- They offered me the job.

18:41.031 --> 18:44.590
They asked me to operate
on the President. I mean...

18:46.076 --> 18:49.728
(STAMMERING) That's amazing.
Congratulations.

18:49.830 --> 18:52.048
- BRIAN: Wow.
- I know. It's insane.

18:52.050 --> 18:53.449
Apparently he wants
to send a signal

18:53.489 --> 18:55.282
that he supports
the public healthcare system.

18:55.453 --> 18:58.871
- Still. I can't believe he chose me.
- So, what did you say?

18:58.906 --> 19:04.926
What do you mean? I said yes.
It's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

19:06.897 --> 19:09.849
- I thought you'd be proud.
- I am proud. I am.

19:10.467 --> 19:12.351
- But...
- But what, Brian?

19:12.353 --> 19:13.985
But it's a huge undertaking.

19:13.989 --> 19:16.238
They're gonna put us
under a microscope.

19:16.273 --> 19:20.476
Review our tax records,
emails, telephone calls...

19:20.478 --> 19:24.163
I don't need a bunch of people digging
through every loan, every deal...

19:24.165 --> 19:26.532
- We've got nothing to hide.
- No, I know, I know.

19:26.534 --> 19:29.985
I don't have anything to hide,
but, what I'm saying is...

19:29.987 --> 19:33.443
It's a huge commitment.
You're already too busy.

19:33.481 --> 19:35.772
We barely see you as it is.

20:04.988 --> 20:06.739
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

20:09.326 --> 20:10.526
(BANGING)

20:14.164 --> 20:16.984
(MUTTERING)
Jake, where are you?

20:57.541 --> 21:00.759
- Shouldn't you be in class, Ms. Sanders?
- It's a free period.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.213
(BELL RINGING)

21:11.938 --> 21:13.305
Where's my brother, Kevin?

21:13.307 --> 21:14.690
Haven't seen him all day.

21:14.692 --> 21:17.393
Look, I know that you think
you're doing Jake a solid,

21:17.395 --> 21:20.996
but I need to know
where he is. Now!

21:22.199 --> 21:25.567
I saw him heading out back...
Look behind the bleachers.

21:39.282 --> 21:42.684
We need to go. Now!

21:43.720 --> 21:45.171
JAKE:
I can explain.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.990
It's not what it looks like, okay?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.236
You wanted to see me?

22:00.238 --> 22:01.570
Yeah.
Could you do me a favor?

22:01.572 --> 22:03.957
Can you go to the Hellman Building
and put this in my desk?

22:03.973 --> 22:05.241
What is it?

22:05.243 --> 22:07.142
It's nothing. It's just, uh, documents
I have to give to somebody

22:07.144 --> 22:08.661
I have a really busy day...

22:08.663 --> 22:10.729
So do I.
Can you just help me out?

22:10.781 --> 22:13.332
Okay. Yeah, I'll drop
it off on my way home.

22:13.334 --> 22:16.375
No. I need it done, like, now.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.720
Seriously?

22:18.655 --> 22:22.157
I'm sorry. That didn't come out right.
I just...

22:25.295 --> 22:28.214
I'm the one asking you
to do me the favor.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.015
Just because
we're sleeping together,

22:30.017 --> 22:33.352
you do not get to treat me
like your secretary.

22:34.137 --> 22:36.005
I'm the office manager.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.190
That's too bad.

22:38.192 --> 22:40.476
It would be hotter
if you were my secretary.

22:40.544 --> 22:42.611
- I could tell you to do things.
- Hmm?

22:43.063 --> 22:44.230
Order you around.

22:44.232 --> 22:46.815
Oh, someone's in
a naughty mood, huh?

22:46.817 --> 22:50.486
- Mmm. You have no idea.
- (GIGGLES)

22:51.488 --> 22:54.356
- But I gotta get back to work.
- Yeah.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.125
Dinner, later tonight?

22:56.826 --> 22:58.243
Marcel's?

22:58.378 --> 23:00.594
Of course.

23:04.834 --> 23:07.239
Gotta go back to work.

23:18.081 --> 23:20.591
She says
she wants to stop the chemo.

23:20.626 --> 23:22.788
Come home.

23:23.553 --> 23:24.886
She's had enough.

23:24.888 --> 23:26.855
KRAMER: She does that,
then everything we're doing...

23:26.857 --> 23:28.741
it's all for nothing.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.348
I wish I could just tell her the truth.

23:32.445 --> 23:33.895
You'll figure out what to say.

23:33.897 --> 23:35.531
Hell, if you could talk her
into marrying you,

23:35.533 --> 23:37.616
you can talk her into anything.

23:37.618 --> 23:40.343
- Agent Carlisle.
- I've gotta go.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.905
The review board finished
their investigation.

23:44.124 --> 23:45.591
And?

23:46.075 --> 23:47.126
They cleared you.

23:47.128 --> 23:49.595
In fact, they're gonna
give you a commendation.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.847
Welcome back, Duncan.

23:52.382 --> 23:53.465
Good to be back, sir.

23:53.467 --> 23:56.094
I've got a new assignment for you.

24:00.423 --> 24:04.578
Agent Carlisle? Stan Hoffman.
Secret Service.

24:04.628 --> 24:06.979
Agent Hoffman is leading an
Inter-Agency Task Force.

24:06.981 --> 24:08.430
He requested you.

24:09.899 --> 24:11.950
Just give him back when you're done.

24:13.403 --> 24:15.203
Please sit.

24:17.574 --> 24:18.907
So, what's the case?

24:18.909 --> 24:20.275
Missing person.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.262
We're looking into the
disappearance of Angela Nix.

24:23.363 --> 24:24.963
You know who she is?

24:24.965 --> 24:26.999
The nurse who committed suicide.
I saw it on the news.

24:27.001 --> 24:28.417
You think she's still alive?

24:28.419 --> 24:30.468
We don't have a body.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.672
Nix was last seen at the
Windom Tavern at 7:14 p.m.

24:33.674 --> 24:37.909
Her car was discovered at the
edge of the Potomac at 10:42 pm.

24:37.978 --> 24:40.195
So, that leaves over
three hours unaccounted for.

24:40.197 --> 24:41.980
- Any leads?
- Nothing solid.

24:41.982 --> 24:46.301
But we have a witness who saw Nix
talking to a man at the tavern that night.

24:53.810 --> 24:58.296
So we need to keep looking for video
surveillance, canvas for witnesses...

24:58.365 --> 25:00.616
I'll put a team together.
We'll get started right away.

25:00.618 --> 25:02.550
Thank you, Agent Carlisle.

25:02.952 --> 25:05.087
My supervisor said
you requested me...

25:05.089 --> 25:06.288
Mmm-hmm.

25:06.306 --> 25:09.161
But we haven't met before,
have we?

25:09.196 --> 25:10.468
No.

25:10.477 --> 25:12.428
But your track record speaks for itself.

25:12.929 --> 25:14.046
It's quite impressive.

25:14.048 --> 25:16.658
And you come highly recommended.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.826
From somebody in the White House.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.438
(GROANS)

25:22.440 --> 25:24.607
God, take it easy. Oh!

25:24.674 --> 25:26.108
We should have done
this hours ago.

25:26.110 --> 25:28.176
- (GROANS)
- You almost ruined everything

25:28.178 --> 25:29.678
because you wanted to get high.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.648
I was helping us get out of school.

25:32.816 --> 25:34.032
(MUTTERING)
Yeah, right.

25:38.655 --> 25:39.822
(GRUNTS)

25:40.657 --> 25:42.207
Stop it! Seriously.

25:42.209 --> 25:44.910
It's filling up with blood,
I can't see...

25:44.912 --> 25:46.578
Just take it out!

25:46.580 --> 25:47.830
Almost...

25:48.915 --> 25:50.132
(GROANS)

25:52.218 --> 25:53.635
No.

25:53.637 --> 25:56.852
They'll know something is up
if it stops transmitting.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.927
Okay, um...

26:02.613 --> 26:04.984
Sterilize the tweezers
and scalpel with iodine.

26:04.989 --> 26:06.637
I'll patch you up.

26:08.601 --> 26:10.903
Come on. It's my turn.

26:19.612 --> 26:22.030
- Let's go!
- I'm going.

26:37.580 --> 26:39.999
Aren't you were supposed
to be in surgery, Doctor?

26:40.049 --> 26:41.082
It got canceled.

26:41.084 --> 26:42.267
Where are you going?

26:42.269 --> 26:43.769
- To get a latte.
- Where?

26:43.771 --> 26:46.355
At the cafe, a block away.
Is that a problem?

26:46.357 --> 26:48.390
What's wrong with the coffee cart
in the lobby?

26:48.392 --> 26:51.193
Well, the coffee sucks.
There's nowhere to sit.

26:51.195 --> 26:54.529
And it's in the lobby of a hospital.
Shall I continue?

26:55.281 --> 26:58.386
You call before you leave.

26:59.235 --> 27:00.536
Anything else?

27:00.538 --> 27:03.134
- You lose something?
- What?

27:03.323 --> 27:05.054
Where's your wedding ring?

27:05.274 --> 27:08.108
I took it off.
Before surgery.

27:10.330 --> 27:15.083
For the rest of the day, you're
gonna check in every 15 minutes.

27:15.284 --> 27:17.628
- But...
- But what?

27:17.670 --> 27:20.255
Your surgery was canceled, right?

27:21.474 --> 27:23.291
Every 15 minutes.

27:23.426 --> 27:26.662
One second more,
we will have a problem.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.186
(DIALING)

27:34.904 --> 27:36.104
(RINGING)

27:37.574 --> 27:39.241
- Are you on your way?
- We have to call it off.

27:39.243 --> 27:40.943
What? What the hell are you
talking about?

27:40.945 --> 27:43.645
They caught me trying to get away
and I can't get out of the hospital.

27:43.647 --> 27:44.813
Are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

27:44.815 --> 27:46.665
No, I'm fine.
I covered, but I...

27:46.667 --> 27:47.816
I can't get out.
I can't get to the kids.

27:47.818 --> 27:49.855
They want me to check in
every 15 minutes.

27:49.890 --> 27:52.868
So, you need to get to the school
and tell the kids to stop. Now!

27:52.903 --> 27:54.322
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

27:54.324 --> 27:55.952
They probably already
cut out the chips.

27:55.990 --> 27:57.823
We can't hide that.
We can't stop.

27:57.907 --> 27:59.791
It's over.
I can't get away from him.

27:59.832 --> 28:01.982
I have to check in
every 15 minutes, okay?

28:02.017 --> 28:03.832
- He got suspicious.
- Why? What happened?

28:03.834 --> 28:06.248
We needed money
so I went to a pawnbroker.

28:06.303 --> 28:07.553
A pawnbroker? What the...

28:07.555 --> 28:09.337
I sold my wedding ring.
He noticed.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.172
I told you I'd get the cash.

28:11.174 --> 28:14.192
It's done, all right?
Just get to the kids and call this off.

28:14.194 --> 28:16.038
Leave the hospital at 2:15.

28:16.074 --> 28:18.258
Pick up the passports,
meet the kids.

28:18.293 --> 28:19.565
I told them I would meet them
at 2:00...

28:19.567 --> 28:22.150
So be a little late.
The bus doesn't leave till 2:45.

28:22.152 --> 28:25.086
Are you even listening to me?
I can't get rid of him.

28:25.488 --> 28:28.273
I'll make sure no one is
following you.

28:28.324 --> 28:29.962
How?

I was disappointed in her.

It's not about that. At all.

30:42.546 --> 30:44.397
