00:06.733 --> 00:08.700
( theme music playing )

00:17.333 --> 00:19.600
( rapid beeping )

00:22.267 --> 00:24.267
WHAT IS THAT?

00:24.300 --> 00:26.267
I DON'T KNOW.

00:27.733 --> 00:29.700
WHAT IS THAT,
A CELL PHONE?

00:31.300 --> 00:33.233
( beeping stops )

00:34.267 --> 00:36.233
( sighs )

00:43.200 --> 00:45.633
( rapid beeping )

00:45.667 --> 00:47.933
GOD.

00:50.033 --> 00:53.600

00:53.633 --> 00:56.300
OH, IT'S A SMOKE ALARM.
THE SMOKE ALARM'S
GOING OFF.

00:56.333 --> 00:57.833
( Cheryl groans )

00:57.867 --> 01:00.833
IT'S THE STUPID BATTERIES.
CO ON, WE'VE GOTTA
FIND IT.

01:00.867 --> 01:02.367
( beeping continues )

01:02.400 --> 01:05.133
NO, IT'S NOT
THAT ONE.

01:10.233 --> 01:12.200
IT'S NOT THAT ONE.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.100
NO.
TRY THE GUEST ROOM.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.400
( beeping continues )

01:22.967 --> 01:24.433
I THINK
IT'S DOWNSTAIRS.

01:54.767 --> 01:56.567
( screams )

01:57.633 --> 02:00.333
( screams )

02:20.700 --> 02:22.633
( beeping stops )

02:28.933 --> 02:30.267
Richard:
I DON'T THINK
I HAVE ANY FEELING

02:30.300 --> 02:31.967
IN MY SHOULDERS,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

02:32.067 --> 02:33.867
- IT DOES
TAKE ITS TOLL, MAN.
- TAKE ITS TOLL--

02:33.900 --> 02:36.067
- YOU DID
VERY WELL, BY THE WAY.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONDESCEND.

02:36.067 --> 02:37.600
NO, SERIOUSLY,
FOR A GUY WHO
DOESN'T PLAY,

02:37.633 --> 02:39.500
I THOUGHT
HE DID VERY WELL.
YOU DID.

02:39.533 --> 02:41.100
YOU NEVER PLAY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM YOURSELF?

02:41.133 --> 02:43.067
- GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK.
- Jeff: ONE THING I WANT
TO TELL YOU,

02:43.067 --> 02:45.200
- AFTER YOU HIT THE BALL
SIX, SEVEN TIMES...
- YEAH?

02:45.233 --> 02:47.300
...AND IT'S NOT IN THE HOLE,
JUST PICK IT UP AND
WE'LL MOVE ON.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.933
- YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE
MORE THAN SEVEN STROKES.
- YEAH, THAT'S JUST CRAZINES.

02:49.967 --> 02:51.667
JUST PICK UP THE BALL.
HE'S RIGHT, YEAH.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.367
- WELL, YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
TO EXPERIENCE ME AGAIN.
- NO, WE HAD FUN.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.533
DIDN'T YOU HAVE FUN
WITH US, HANGING OUT?

02:55.567 --> 02:57.867
IT WAS A LITTLE BORING,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.967
- THAT'S A NICE
THING TO SAY.
- WELL, IT FUCKING WAS.

03:01.067 --> 03:04.667
OKAY, GIVE ME BACK
MY $150 THAT I SPENT
ON YOUR GUEST FEE.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.300
YOU PAID $150
FOR ME TO LOOK
LIKE A FUCKING ASSHOLE?

03:07.333 --> 03:09.100
- ( men continue chattering )
- TV anchor: More shocking
footage

03:09.133 --> 03:12.233
From Hurricane Edna
which has left extensive
destruction in its wake.

03:12.267 --> 03:15.967
- Larry: THESE POOR PEOPLE.
- The storm surge inundated
low-lying areas

03:16.067 --> 03:17.733
- Knocking out
phone and power lines.
- OH, BOY.

03:17.767 --> 03:19.567
Larry:
THAT'S FROM GLOBAL WARMING,
THAT HURRICANE.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.267
Anchor:
33 deaths have been reported
and thousands left homeless.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.067
LOOK AT THAT--
THOUSANDS OF HOMELESS
PEOPLE NOW.

03:24.067 --> 03:26.167
FEMA is estimating damage
from this Category 5 hurricane

03:26.200 --> 03:27.733
in the billions
of dollars.

03:27.767 --> 03:31.333
OH, WOW. IT'S KATRINA
ALL OVER AGAIN.
POOR PEOPLE.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.167
DID YOU GO TO
FUNKHOUSER'S PARTY
LAST NIGHT?

03:33.200 --> 03:34.933
Jeff: NO. DID YOU?

03:34.967 --> 03:37.367
NO. HUH-UH.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.500
WHY?

03:38.533 --> 03:40.833
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO DANSON'S PARTY TONIGHT.

03:40.867 --> 03:42.833
TWO BACK TO BACK--

03:42.867 --> 03:44.933
I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO TWO PARTIES
BACK TO BACK.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.767
IT WAS A STUPID NIGHT
FOR HIM TO HAVE A PARTY.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.233
- YEAH.
- DID YOU CALL HIM?

03:49.267 --> 03:51.567
NO.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.467
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?
- I'LL TELL HIM
SAMMY WAS SICK.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.233
YOU'RE GONNA
USE YOUR CHILD
TO GET OUT OF A PARTY?

03:56.267 --> 03:59.233
- WHY NOT? IT'S THE BEST
THING IN THE WORLD.
- IT'S A PERFECT EXCUSE.

03:59.267 --> 04:01.367
- NO ONE CAN
ARGUE WITH THAT.
- WHO ARGUES WITH THAT?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.500
I WISH I HAD THAT.
IT'S A GREAT REASON
TO HAVE KIDS.

04:03.533 --> 04:05.967
IT'S A GREAT
REASON TO HAVE KIDS.
IT'S ONE OF THE BONUSES, YEP.

04:06.067 --> 04:09.500
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY?

04:09.533 --> 04:11.733
- YOU HAVE NOTHING,
NOTHING.
- I KNOW.

04:11.767 --> 04:14.267
I'LL JUST SHOW UP TONIGHT
AND PRETEND I HAD
THE WRONG NIGHT.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.333
- THAT'S STUPID.
- THAT'S GREAT.

04:16.367 --> 04:18.967
- OH, PLEASE.
- NO, THAT'S FANTASTIC.
I LOVE THAT.

04:19.067 --> 04:21.233
YEAH. DING-DONG--
"WHERE'S THE PARTY?"

04:21.267 --> 04:22.867
- ISN'T THAT A GOOD IDEA?
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.400
HE'S NOT GONNA BUY THAT.
THAT'S SUCH OBVIOUS
BULLSHIT.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.567
NO, IT ISN'T.
NOBODY WOULD GO
OUT OF THEIR WAY

04:27.600 --> 04:29.500
THAT MUCH-- TO SHOW UP
AT SOMEBODY'S HOUSE,

04:29.533 --> 04:31.300
PRETEND THEY HAD
THE WRONG NIGHT.

04:31.333 --> 04:32.500
HE'S GOTTA BE
A MENTAL CASE
TO BELIEVE IT.

04:32.533 --> 04:35.133
NO, I LOVE THAT.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.867
HAVE YOU
EVER SEEN RICHARD
LOOK IN THE MIRROR?

04:39.067 --> 04:41.600
IS THAT REALLY

04:41.633 --> 04:43.867
- YOU HAPPY NOW?
- YEAH.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.700
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU
AT DANSON'S?
- YEAH.

04:45.733 --> 04:49.433
- OKAY.
- THANKS FOR TURNING ME OFF
TO A SPORT FOREVER.

04:49.467 --> 04:50.967
IT'S OKAY.
ARE YOU GONNA
GO TONIGHT?

04:51.067 --> 04:54.700
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE TO ASK CHA CHA.
I'LL SEE.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.367
- CHA CHA.
- CHA CHA.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.200
WHERE DID HE
GET HER FROM?
MAN, OH, MAN.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.500
- SHE IS SO HOT.
- GOOD FOR HIM.

05:02.533 --> 05:05.333

05:11.667 --> 05:14.733
OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA WEAR?

05:14.767 --> 05:16.500
I'M GONNA DRESS
LIKE A LITTLE
DUTCH GIRL.

05:16.533 --> 05:19.300
- ( guffaws )
- "WHAT AM I WEARING?"

05:22.800 --> 05:24.533
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT THE HURRICANE.

05:24.567 --> 05:27.633
OH, MY NOSE IS
REALLY ITCHING ME
AND I CAN'T SCRATCH IT.

05:27.667 --> 05:31.833
I MEAN,
THE PICTURES ON TV
WERE JUST--

05:31.867 --> 05:35.167
YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
THAT PEOPLE SURVIVED IT.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.267
I KNOW,
IT'S AWFUL.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.200
AWFUL.
I WAS WATCHING
IT TODAY.

05:38.233 --> 05:41.800
ALL THESE PEOPLE--
THEY HAVE NO PLACE
TO GO RIGHT NOW.

05:41.833 --> 05:43.867
- ( car horn honks )
- HEY! HEY, DUM-DUM,

05:43.900 --> 05:45.500
GO AHEAD,
MOVE IN.

05:45.533 --> 05:48.867
- THANK YOU.
- I MEAN, THEIR HOUSES WERE
COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.467
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY FATHER USED TO
CALL THOSE PEOPLE?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.567
SCHMOHAWKS.
DID I EVER
TELL YOU THAT?

05:52.600 --> 05:55.100
- YEAH.
- HAVE I MENTIONED
SCHMOHAWKS TO YOU?

05:55.133 --> 05:56.733
SCHMOHAWK.
"HEY, SCHMOHAWK!"

05:56.767 --> 05:59.167
- HE USED TO
YELL IT OUT ALL THE TIME.
- IMAGINE FOR ONE SECOND

05:59.200 --> 06:03.100
IF WE LOST-- IF YOU
LOST EVERY SINGLE THING
YOU HAD IN YOUR LIFE.

06:03.133 --> 06:04.667
WHAT DO I HAVE?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S SO--

06:04.700 --> 06:06.967
- WHAT DO I HAVE?
- THIS IS-- WELL, THERE--

06:07.067 --> 06:09.767
- I LIKE THIS SPORT JACKET.
I CAN'T REPLACE THIS ONE.
- LISTEN, WHEN THERE'S--

06:09.800 --> 06:11.367
YOU KNOW WHAT
SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING,

06:11.400 --> 06:14.733
THAT I PERSONALLY THINK
IS A REALLY GREAT IDEA,

06:14.767 --> 06:17.333
IS THEY'RE BRINGING IN
DISPLACED FAMILIES.

06:17.367 --> 06:18.933
- HMM.
- YOU KNOW,

06:18.967 --> 06:21.200
I'VE BEEN DOING
A LITTLE RESEARCH

06:21.233 --> 06:23.900
AND WE COULD ACTUALLY
HAVE A FAMILY HERE
TOMORROW.

06:23.933 --> 06:25.167
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.267
- TOMORROW?
- THEY HAVE
NO PLACE TO GO.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.400
I WOULD NEED
A COUPLE OF MONTHS

06:29.433 --> 06:31.233
TO MENTALLY
PREPARE FOR THAT.
TOMORROW?

06:31.267 --> 06:32.867
WE DON'T HAVE
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.267
THESE PEOPLE
NEED HELP RIGHT NOW.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.333
IT'S A NICE CONCEPT.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.800
UH, YOU KNOW,
WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

06:41.833 --> 06:44.133
WE DON'T NEED TO JUMP
INTO THIS THING
RIGHT NOW.

06:44.167 --> 06:46.300
IMAGINE HOW
THEY WOULD FEEL

06:46.333 --> 06:48.667
TO COME HERE
AND LIVE IN OUR HOUSE.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.633
MMM.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.300
- THIS IS SO STUPID.
- WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING?

06:59.333 --> 07:01.967
THERE'S NOTHING TO IT.
WE'LL JUST PRETEND

07:02.067 --> 07:05.433
THIS WAY HE FEELS GOOD--

07:07.400 --> 07:09.733
WE'RE GONNA GO

I LOVE THAT WE DIDN'T
PLAY LAST NIGHT?

09:41.133 --> 09:42.867
IT'S-- AND WE PLAY IT
FOR MONEY--

09:42.900 --> 09:44.833
"1000 PICK-UP STICKS."

09:44.867 --> 09:48.100
I GO GET THE STICKS,
I THROW THEM ALL OVER
THE ROOM...

09:48.133 --> 09:50.067
- ( doorbell rings )
- ...AND WE PICK UP
THE STICKS.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.367
AND THE ONE
WITH THE MOST STICKS
WINS THE POT.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.500
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
- Cheryl: ARE YOU EXPECTING
COMPANY?

09:54.533 --> 09:56.600
YEAH, WHAT IS THIS?
YOU GOT COMPANY?

09:56.633 --> 09:58.067
- Cheryl: NOW WE'RE
INTRUDING ON YOUR COMPANY.
- I'LL GET RID OF THEM.

09:58.067 --> 10:01.467
- NOW IT'S REALLY CRAZY.
- PLEASE RELAX.
I'LL GET RID OF THEM.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.800
Cheryl:
ARE YOU GUYS
EXPECTING COMPANY?

10:05.833 --> 10:07.600
- Susie: HI.
- Jeff: HEY.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.500
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- Both: THE PARTY.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.500
WHERE'S EVERYBODY?

10:13.533 --> 10:17.167
JUST A LITTLE NOTE:
THE PARTY WAS
LAST NIGHT.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.433
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE PARTY WAS LAST NIGHT?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:19.467 --> 10:21.300
- THE PARTY WAS LAST NIGHT.
- Jeff: IT'S TONIGHT.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.400
WELL, GUESS WHO ELSE
THOUGHT IT WAS TONIGHT?

10:23.433 --> 10:25.200
WHO?

10:25.233 --> 10:27.333
- WHAT ARE THE ODDS?
- YEAH, WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

10:27.367 --> 10:30.000
- OH MY GOD, HOW ABOUT THAT?
- Susie: WE'RE JUST GONNA GO.

10:30.033 --> 10:32.133
- THEY HAD THE WRONG NIGHT
JUST LIKE US!
- ( Nan laughing )

10:32.167 --> 10:34.500
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- UNBELIEVABLE.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.267
- Marty: NO NO NO.
- Jeff: SEE YOU LATER.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.300
- Marty: COME ON IN.
- Jeff: NO. NO, LISTEN...

10:38.333 --> 10:40.433
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE
GET-TOGETHER TONIGHT.

10:40.467 --> 10:43.133
- NO NO, WE'LL GO.
CHERYL, WE'LL GO.
- WE'LL GO, WE'LL GO.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.800
WE'LL ALL GO.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.500
- DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
- WE'LL GO.

10:46.533 --> 10:48.700
NO, DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
LISTEN TO ME.

10:48.733 --> 10:51.467
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A LITTLE PARTY TONIG.
- WELL, NOT A PARTY...

10:51.500 --> 10:54.333
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING? YOU STOLE MY
WRONG-NIGHT BIT.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.100
I DIDN'T STEAL IT.
I GIVE YOU FULL CREDIT.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.400
IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA.
I TOLD SUSIE

10:58.433 --> 11:00.067
- IT WAS YOUR IDEA.
- WE'RE NEVER GETTING
OUT OF HERE.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.533
- WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE
IN FIVE MINUTES.
- FIVE MINUTES?

11:01.567 --> 11:04.800
- TRUST ME.
FIVE MINUTES.
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING:

11:04.833 --> 11:06.667
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE MAKING DANSON'S
PARTY TONIGHT.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.167
- WE ARE LOCKED IN HERE.
THIS IS IT.
- "LOCKED IN."

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
- FIVE MINUTES--
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
- OH, REALLY?

11:11.233 --> 11:13.067
- WATCH. FIVE MINUTES.
- OH YEAH? YOU WATCH.

11:13.100 --> 11:15.567
Marty:
SO, IS THIS FUN
OR WHAT?

11:17.200 --> 11:19.333
- THE CAKE IS WONDERFUL.
- Susie: THE CAKE
IS INCREDIBLE.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.067
- BEST CAKE EVER?
- BEST CAKE I EVER HAD.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.067
EVER.
AND WHO'S EVER HAD
MORE CAKE THAN ME?

11:23.067 --> 11:25.167
- Susie: EXACTLY.
HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
- Marty: DO YOU LOVE THAT?

11:25.200 --> 11:27.067
WHAT IS THE DEAL?
I'VE NEVER TASTED
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.400
- EVERYTHING IS HANDMADE.
- WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

11:29.433 --> 11:31.333
- I'M SUCKING
ON IT LIKE A MINT.
- AT A CAKE SHOP.

11:31.367 --> 11:34.500
- WHAT WAS THE SHOP?
- THAT'S A NEW WAY OF
EATING CAKE-- LIKE A MINT.

11:34.533 --> 11:35.767
WAIT, I NEED
TO FIND-- WHERE?

11:35.800 --> 11:37.500
26th STREET BAKERY,
WE GOT IT.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.867
- Susie: YOU KNOW JEFF--
HE CAN'T STOP...
- THE TEXTURE.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.533
- ALL RIGHT, THIS HAS BEEN--
- Jeff: YEAH, WE GOTTA
GET GOING.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.367
- WE GOTTA GET GOING.
- Marty: HAS THIS BEEN
BETTER THAN YOU THOUGHT?

11:44.400 --> 11:46.400
- WE GOTTA GET GOING.
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.800
- NO, I'VE GOTTA GET GOING.
- NO NO, WE GOTTA GET GOING.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.867
MY DAUGHTER IS WAITING
FOR A PUPPET SHOW.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.933
- MY DAD HAS A VIRUS.
HE'S IN BED...
- LARRY'S DAD'S GOT A VIRUS.

11:52.967 --> 11:55.200
- ...WITH FEVER,
WITH COVERS UP TO HIS NECK.
- WE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

11:55.233 --> 11:57.267
YOUR DAD ALWAYS
HAS A VIRUS, OKAY?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.500
- FUCK YOU, HE DOESN'T
ALWAYS HAVE A VIRUS.
- HOLD IT ONE SECOND.

11:59.533 --> 12:01.733
- ( dinging on glass )
- YOU GUYS STAY HERE,
KEEP HIM COMPANY.

12:01.767 --> 12:04.700
- WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING FOR SAMMY.
- YOU STAY HERE THEN.

12:04.733 --> 12:05.867
- YOU STAY.
- YOU STAY.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.567
- YOU STAY.
- ( Marty bangs on table )

12:07.600 --> 12:09.300
- Nan: OH.
- Marty: HOLD IT A MINUTE.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.567
YOU GUYS WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE

12:11.600 --> 12:13.533
TO GO TO A PARTY,
RIGHT?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.367
YOU GOT NOTHING
GOING ON.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.500
FATHER SICK,
PUPPETS--

12:17.533 --> 12:20.400
TOMORROW YOU'LL
TAKE YOUR PUPPETS
OVER TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE

12:20.433 --> 12:22.100
AND MAKE HIM
FEEL BETTER, OKAY?

12:22.133 --> 12:25.667
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN.
AND GUESS WHAT OUR
NEXT MOVE IS.

12:25.700 --> 12:28.067
- Jeff: WHAT?
- WE'RE GOING INTO
THE LIVING ROOM

12:28.067 --> 12:30.933
AND WE'RE GONNA PLAY
"THE NEWLYWED GAME."

12:30.967 --> 12:33.833
- Nan: YES.
- BECAUSE WE PLAYED IT
LAST NIGHT

12:33.867 --> 12:35.833
AND IT WAS
SPECTACULAR.

12:35.867 --> 12:37.733
All: OH MY GOD!

12:37.767 --> 12:40.167
- ( Nan laughs )
- Marty: YES, THAT'S GREAT.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.167
Nan: DO I KNOW MY HUSBAND?

12:42.200 --> 12:44.500
- Larry: UNBELIEVABLE.
- YOU ARE GOOD AT THIS.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.567
- OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.433
THAT WAS GREAT.
"IF YOU COULD HAVE SEX

12:49.467 --> 12:52.800
WITH ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS'
WIVES OR GIRLFRIENDS...

12:52.833 --> 12:53.933
- ( all exclaim )
- ...WHO WOULD IT BE?"

12:53.967 --> 12:56.500
- Susie: OOH.
- ( all giggle )

12:56.533 --> 12:59.267
- Susie: THAT'S
A DANGEROUS ONE.
- Both: OKAY.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.567
- Larry: ALL RIGHT.
- Cheryl: HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.533
- Marty: TELL ME WHEN
YOU'RE READY. I'M READY.
- Larry: I THINK WE GOT THIS.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.467
- Both: I'M READY.
- Jeff: I'M READY.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.967
- Marty: I'M GONNA
GO FIRST, OKAY?
- ALL RIGHT.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.067
I WILL SAY, CHERYL,
THAT YOU ARE ADORABLE.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.533
THANK YOU.
( chuckles )

13:16.567 --> 13:18.833
SUSIE,
YOU DRESS GREAT.

13:18.867 --> 13:22.100
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S MY FORTE, MARTY.

13:22.133 --> 13:24.833
BUT WHEN I REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT,

13:24.867 --> 13:27.667
- I'VE GOTTA GO WITH
MY LITTLE POOFER.
- ( screams )

13:27.700 --> 13:29.833
- LOOK AT THE--
- ( all exclaiming )

13:29.867 --> 13:32.167
- OH MY GOD.
- ( all laughing )

13:32.200 --> 13:35.067
- OH MY GOD.
- OH, MAN.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.100
- Jeff: OH, GOD.
- Susie: THAT'S CUTE.

13:37.133 --> 13:39.367
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
HOW ABOUT THAT?
- Marty: ISN'T THAT GREAT?

13:39.400 --> 13:41.600
- GO GO, I WANNA HEAR YOURS.
- Cheryl: THAT IS GREAT.

13:41.633 --> 13:43.567
- HOLD IT,
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.
- Cheryl: OKAY.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.200
- YOU'RE NEXT.
- ALL RIGHT.

13:46.233 --> 13:50.133
I'M GONNA GO WITH...

13:50.167 --> 13:52.267
- CHA CHA.
- Jeff: CHA CHA? WOW.

13:52.300 --> 13:55.400
- Susie: CHA CHA?
LEWIS'S GIRLFRIEND?
- Jeff: YEAH, CHA CHA.

13:56.967 --> 14:00.633
OH MY GOD, I HAD NO IDEA
YOU HAD A THING
FOR CHA CHA.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.533
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I DON'T HAVE A THING
FOR CHA CHA.

14:02.567 --> 14:05.067
RICHARD'S GIRLFRIEND?

14:05.100 --> 14:06.733
- WHAT?
- Marty: THAT WAS
A DUMB ANSWER.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.800
- OH, STOP IT.
- I MEAN, I HAD NO IDEA

14:08.833 --> 14:11.100
THAT YOU'VE BEEN--
THAT YOU WANTED TO HAVE
SEX WITH CHA CHA.

14:11.133 --> 14:12.967
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH HER.
I'M ANSWERING THE QUESTION.

14:13.067 --> 14:16.867
- WHAT WAS THE QUESTION, MARTY?
- "WHO DO YOU WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH?"

14:16.900 --> 14:19.067
- WHO DID YOU PUT DOWN?
- Susie: OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S
A FANTASY GOING DOWN.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.067
- Jeff: OH, GET
ME INVOLVED NOW.
- Susie: WHO DID YOU SAY?

14:21.100 --> 14:23.733
- WHO WERE YOU GONNA SAY?
- I WAS GONNA ANSWER SUSIE.

14:23.767 --> 14:26.933
- Marty: GOOD ANSWER.
- OH, GOD, YOU'RE BOTH
FULL OF SHIT.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.400
- EXACTLY.
- YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.067
- YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT.
- I LOVE MY WIFE.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.467
- OH, YOU'RE ALL SO GOOD.
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT CHA CHA.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.700
YOU LOVE YOUR WIVES.
FUCK YOU AND FUCK YOU.

14:36.733 --> 14:40.200
OH, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S MAD.
I LOVE IT.

14:43.833 --> 14:47.167
COME ON, HONEY.
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT CHA CHA.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.167
I WAS TRYING
TO WIN THE GAME.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.500
YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS SEXY.
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
YOU WOULD WRITE DOWN.

14:52.533 --> 14:55.300
CHERYL, COME ON.

14:55.333 --> 14:58.300
I DON'T--
COME ON, WHAT CAN I DO?

14:58.333 --> 15:01.067
WHAT CAN I DO?
I'LL DO ANYTHING.
COME ON.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.633
ANYTHING?

15:04.667 --> 15:06.667
WELL, YOU KNOW,

15:06.700 --> 15:09.533
SHORT OF ADOPTING
THIS HURRICANE FAMILY.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.133
Cheryl:
I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET TO THE AIRPORT

15:17.167 --> 15:19.267
TO SEE THE FAMILY.
IT'S SO EXCITING.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.833
- ARE YOU EXCITED?
- MMM.

15:20.867 --> 15:23.833
WE'LL FINALLY
GET TO MEET THEM.
THEY'RE GONNA BE SO HAPPY.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.633
THE GUY ON THE PHONE
WAS SAYING HOW EXCITED
THEY WERE

15:25.667 --> 15:28.400
WHEN THEY GOT ON THE PLANE
'CAUSE THEY'D NEVER BEEN
TO L.A. BEFORE.

15:28.433 --> 15:31.133
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS WEIRD,

15:31.167 --> 15:33.100
BUT I'VE BEEN TALKING,
YOU KNOW, TO THEM...

15:33.133 --> 15:34.400
( car horn honks )

15:34.433 --> 15:37.800
...AND ABOUT THEM,
YOU KNOW...

15:37.833 --> 15:39.800
YEAH.
I JUST--

15:39.833 --> 15:44.133
I JUST WANT TO MAKE
ONE QUICK STOP
BEFORE WE GO.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.067
- HEY.
- HEY.

15:51.067 --> 15:52.233
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING?

15:54.067 --> 15:57.067
WHAT'S--
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:57.067 --> 15:59.733
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:59.767 --> 16:02.700
- WHERE'S EVERYBODY?
- WE THOUGHT THERE WAS
A PARTY.

16:02.733 --> 16:05.900
OH MY GOD, YOU THOUGHT
THE PARTY WAS TONIGHT?

16:05.933 --> 16:08.233
- YEAH.
- LAST NIGHT.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.133
- WHAT?
- THE PARTY WAS
LAST NIGHT.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.200
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- NO, MAN.

16:12.233 --> 16:14.533
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. WHAT?
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

16:14.567 --> 16:18.067
- WE GOT THE WRONG NIGHT?
- YEAH, YOU DID.

16:18.067 --> 16:20.533
- OH, SHOOT. ALL RIGHT.
- JESUS CHRIST.
HOLY COW.

16:20.567 --> 16:22.100
I'M ACTUALLY GLAD
TO HEAR THIS.

16:22.133 --> 16:24.600
I WAS A LITTLE PISSED OFF
THAT YOU DIDN'T CALL.

16:24.633 --> 16:26.633
- OH, WELL, NOW YOU KNOW
WHY WE DIDN'T CALL.
- YEAH.

16:26.667 --> 16:30.067
- HEY, MARY.
- OF COURSE WE DIDN'T CALL--
'CAUSE WE WERE COMING TONIGHT.

16:30.100 --> 16:32.133
- COME ON IN.
- OH, NO NO.
WE'RE NOT GONNA COME IN.

16:32.167 --> 16:35.267
- YEAH, COME IN, SERIOUSLY.
- WE GOT THE WRONG NIGHT.
IT'S OUR FAULT.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.067
- HEY, MARY.
- THEY THOUGHT THE PARTY
WAS TONIGHT.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.533
- ( laughing )
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.400
CAN YOU BELIEVE
HOW STUPID WE ARE?

16:42.433 --> 16:43.900
- ALL RIGHT,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- Mary: LARR.

16:43.933 --> 16:46.600
- WE'LL CALL YOU LATER.
- NO WAY YOU'RE LEAVING.

16:46.633 --> 16:49.133
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
WE HAVE SO MUCH
LEFTOVER FOOD.

16:49.167 --> 16:50.400
YOU'RE GONNA COME IN
AND HELP US EAT IT.

16:50.433 --> 16:52.833
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW
AND WE'LL GET TOGETHER.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.500
- WE'LL DO THE WHOLE--
- WHY?

16:54.533 --> 16:56.567
- WE'LL DO A PROPER--
- I'LL TAKE YOU OUT TO DINNER.
I'M PAYING.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.967
HEY, LARR,
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY PLANS,

16:59.067 --> 17:00.900
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE,
YOU'RE HERE.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.733
COME ON IN.
COME IN, CHERYL.
IT'LL BE FUN.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.067
WELL...

17:09.100 --> 17:11.733
THIS'LL BE FUN.
WE'VE GOT LEFTOVERS.
WE'LL MAKE AN OMELET.

17:11.767 --> 17:14.167
- SURE. OH YEAH.
- YOU GUYS, WE CAN'T--
WE CAN'T--

17:14.200 --> 17:17.133
IT'LL BE GREAT.
COME ON.

17:17.167 --> 17:19.167
- THIS IS LIKE PULLING TEETH.
- ( Mary and Ted laugh )

17:19.200 --> 17:21.100
COME ON IN,
YOU GUYS.

17:26.867 --> 17:28.767
I DON'T KNOW.
CAN YOU STILL SEE IT?

17:28.800 --> 17:31.733
- NOT LIKE IT WAS.
- A HUGE CYST.

17:31.767 --> 17:34.467
IT WAS LIKE--
WHEN THEY GOT AROUND
TO TAKING IT OUT,

17:34.500 --> 17:36.900
IT TURNS OUT
I COULD HAVE ALMOST
BROKEN MY JAW

17:36.933 --> 17:38.867
- BY JUST CHEWING ON ICE.
- Cheryl: OH MY GOSH.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.967
- IT GOT ALL THE WAY
DOWN INTO HERE.
- BUT THE DENTIST

17:41.067 --> 17:44.700
REALLY UNDERSOLD
THE MAGNITUDE OF IT,
I THINK.

17:44.733 --> 17:46.867
- OH, COMPLETELY.
- 'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NOTHING.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.800
- EVER HAD ANY
OPERATIONS LIKE THAT?
- NO, HUH-UH.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.833
Ted and Larry:
HMM.

17:52.967 --> 17:55.767
- THIS IS NICE.
- YEAH.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.700
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU GUYS?

17:57.733 --> 18:01.067
- EH, NOT MUCH, NOT MUCH.
- NOTHING.

18:01.067 --> 18:03.233
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU'RE BEHAVING LIKE

18:03.267 --> 18:05.200
- YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE, LARRY.
- NO.

18:05.233 --> 18:07.900
- WHAT?
- Mary: YOU WANT TO BE HERE,
DON'T YOU, LARR?

18:07.933 --> 18:09.967
ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S CRAZY.
OF COURSE I WANT
TO BE HERE.

18:10.067 --> 18:12.067
- I JUST FEEL I'M
INTRUDING, THAT'S ALL.
- WE ARE INTRUDING.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.933
I WAS RAISED
NOT TO INTRUDE
ON PEOPLE.

18:13.967 --> 18:17.433
MY MOTHER
WOULD BE HORRIFIED--
HORRIFIED IF SHE KNEW

18:17.467 --> 18:19.233
THAT I WAS SITTING
IN THE LIVING ROOM

18:19.267 --> 18:21.400
THE NIGHT
AFTER A BIG PARTY
JUST TOOK PLACE--

18:21.433 --> 18:23.767
HORRIFIED.
AND IT'S BOTHERING ME.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.067
OH MY GOD,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:26.067 --> 18:28.400
I LEFT THE CAR
RUNNING.

18:28.433 --> 18:31.067
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
I DIDN'T?

18:31.067 --> 18:33.100
IF YOU WALK AWAY
FROM THE CAR, IT'S ON,
AND YOU GOT

18:33.133 --> 18:35.100
YOUR CAR KEYS
IN YOUR HAND, IT GOES
"BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP."

18:35.133 --> 18:37.067
NO, IT DOESN'T GO
"BEEP BEEP BEEP
BEEP BEEP."

18:37.067 --> 18:38.633
YEAH, IT DOES GO
"BEEP BEEP BEEP
BEEP BEEP," LARRY.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.300
- I HAVE ONE TOO.
- REALLY?

18:40.333 --> 18:42.200
- DO YOU WANT TO MAKE
A LITTLE SIDE BET?
- YEAH.

18:42.233 --> 18:43.767
- HOW MUCH?
- 500 BUCKS.

18:43.800 --> 18:44.967
- OKAY, 500 BUCKS?
- YEAH.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.900
- OKAY, YEAH, YOU'RE ON.
- ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

18:46.933 --> 18:48.367
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO
CHECK THE CAR.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.100
YOU CHECK THE CAR.
YOU STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

18:50.133 --> 18:51.700
- SHE CAN DO
ANYTHING SHE WANTS.
- NO NO.

18:51.733 --> 18:53.667
( knocks on door )

18:55.267 --> 18:57.167
I'LL GET IT.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

19:01.667 --> 19:05.300
TEDDY, WE'RE LATE.
WE'RE SORRY.
YOU KNOW CHA CHA, RIGHT?

19:05.333 --> 19:07.767
- I DO. HI, CHA CHA.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
- HI.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.300
Richard:
WHAT'S WITH THE NO-VALET
FOR THE PARTY?

19:09.333 --> 19:10.500
YOU NEED SOME DOUGH?

19:10.533 --> 19:11.867
YEAH, SEE,
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.933
YOU THINK THAT THE PARTY
IS TONIGHT,

19:13.967 --> 19:16.067
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY
LAST NIGHT.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.667
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
IT'S A JOKE?
- NO, I'M NOT.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.333
- Ted: SO COME ON IN
AND SIT.
- NO, IT'S--

19:21.367 --> 19:23.333
- IT'S EMBARRASSING.
- NO NO, IT'S NOT
EMBARRASSING.

19:23.367 --> 19:26.800
YOU KNOW, LARRY AND CHERYL
MADE THE EXACT SAME
MISTAKE YOU DID.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.567
- COME ON IN.
- Cheryl and Mary: HI.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.267
- Richard: MARY, CHERYL.
- Ted: YOU WON'T
BELIEVE THIS:

19:30.300 --> 19:32.400
THEY MADE
THE EXACT SAME MISTAKE
YOU DID, LARRY.

19:32.433 --> 19:35.167
THEY THOUGHT
THE PARTY WAS TONIGHT.
INTERESTING.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.500
( laughs )
YEAH, IT IS
INTERESTING.

19:37.533 --> 19:39.400
CAN I GET
YOU GUYS A DRINK?
YOU WANT A DRINK, RICHARD?

19:39.433 --> 19:41.567
UH, I'M A RECOVERING
ALCOHOLIC.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.900
OH, RIGHT.
I FORGOT THAT.
HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.633
- OKAY, YOU WANT SOMETHING?
- HI, CHERYL, MARY.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.700
- REMEMBER CHA CHA?
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

19:48.733 --> 19:50.367
- Mary: HEY, CHA CHA.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:50.400 --> 19:51.833
WHAT DID YOU STEAL
MY THING FOR?

19:51.867 --> 19:53.533
- WHAT THING?
- SHOWING-UP-ON-THE-WRONG-
NIGHT THING.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.900
WHAT, DO YOU HAVE
A FUCKING COPYRIGHT ON
THIS STUPID LITTLE THING?

19:55.933 --> 19:57.700
YOU'RE MAKING
A FOOL OUT OF ME.
HE'S ONTO ME NOW.

19:57.733 --> 19:59.700
YOU THINK YOU'RE
MAKING A FOOL OF--
I'M BEING MADE A--

19:59.733 --> 20:01.300
I GOT 35 CALLS.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.667
DON'T EVER SAY TO ANYONE
YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX
WITH MY GIRLF--

20:03.700 --> 20:05.700
I DIDN'T SAY--
WE WERE PLAYING
"THE NEWLYWED GAME."

20:05.733 --> 20:07.200
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH
"I WANT TO HAVE INTERCOURSE
WITH CHA CHA"?

20:07.233 --> 20:10.100
I WANTED TO WIN THE GAME.
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

20:10.133 --> 20:11.967
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.400
I CAN'T STAY
IN THE SAME HOUSE AS HIM.
WE'RE GONNA GO. COME ON.

20:14.433 --> 20:16.200
NO NO NO,

I SHOULD GO.

20:16.233 --> 20:18.267

WELL, YOU KNOW,

FIXTURES GOING

22:35.067 --> 22:38.333
OOH-EE!

22:38.367 --> 22:41.300

LET'S HAVE A PARTY.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.367
LET'S HAVE A PARTY

I THINK IT WAS
THE BEST CAKE
WE'VE EVER HAD.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.867
- UNBELIEVABLE.

TALKING ABOUT IT.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.933
IT IS ONE OF OUR
MOST POPULAR CAKES.

23:32.967 --> 23:36.767

23:41.567 --> 23:45.067

- YEAH, WELL, WE'RE
AN EROTIC BAKERY.

23:49.533 --> 23:52.300
OH MY GOD.

23:52.333 --> 23:55.067
THIS IS WHERE MARTY
BUYS HIS CAKES?

23:55.067 --> 23:57.867

23:57.900 --> 24:01.367

24:09.467 --> 24:11.633
- ( soft jazz music playing )
- ( people chattering )

24:11.667 --> 24:14.733
- I'LL TELL YOU,
IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.
- SHE'S RIGHT.

24:14.767 --> 24:17.833
IT WAS ONE OF THE SCARIEST
THINGS I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED
IN MY LIFETIME.

24:17.867 --> 24:20.767
- WE ARE LUCKY WE GOT
OUT OF THERE ALIVE.
- YES, WE ARE.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.633
- I WANT YOU TO MEET
THESE GUYS.
- OKAY.

24:22.667 --> 24:24.533
I HOPE
WE'RE NOT TOO RUDE,
BUT WE SHOWED UP

24:24.567 --> 24:27.400

24:27.433 --> 24:28.733
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.800
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

24:30.833 --> 24:32.733
HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT I WAS EATING

24:32.767 --> 24:35.067
- A BLACK PENIS
THE OTHER NIGHT?
- YOU MEAN THE CAKE?

24:35.067 --> 24:36.533
YEAH.

24:36.567 --> 24:38.933
WELL, I TOLD YOU
IT WAS A BLACK LOG CAKE.

24:38.967 --> 24:40.767
YEAH, STILL,

24:40.800 --> 24:44.067
I WAS EATING
A BLACK PENIS.
YOU DIDN'T MENTION IT.

24:44.067 --> 24:47.800
WELL, EATING A BLACK PENIS
IS NOT APPETIZING
TO EVERYBODY.

24:47.833 --> 24:49.567
NEXT TIME
YOU'RE GONNA DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

24:49.600 --> 24:51.167
TELL ME, OKAY?
I THINK THAT'S UNFAIR.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.633
WHY DID YOU TAKE
THE BALLS HOME?

24:52.667 --> 24:54.967
I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE BALLS.

24:55.067 --> 24:57.667
( Richard and Cha Cha
conversing, giggling )

25:01.633 --> 25:03.600
EXCUSE ME.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.267
MM-HMM.
YES, IT WAS YOU.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.800
WELL...
OH, BOY OH BOY.
HEY.

25:09.833 --> 25:11.533
- HI.
- HI, CHA CHA.

25:11.567 --> 25:14.733
- HI, LARRY.
- I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

25:14.767 --> 25:17.167
I WAS JUST TRYING TO WIN
"THE NEWLYWED GAME"
IS ALL.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.167
LOOK, I'M OVER IT.
I'M HERE.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.733
- BELIEVE ME,
I'M WAY OVER IT.
- YOU KNOW...

25:20.767 --> 25:23.267
- HEY, EVERYBODY,
WHO WANTS CAKE?
- Children: I DO, I DO.

25:23.300 --> 25:26.367
OH, GREAT GREAT.
THE BEST CAKE I EVER HAD.
COME ON.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.833
...GIVE YOU
A CHILDISH APOLOGY...

25:27.867 --> 25:29.567
NO, BECAUSE IT WAS
MY ROUTINE AND--

25:33.133 --> 25:35.167
JEFF!

25:35.200 --> 25:38.367
JEFF, THE CAKE!
JEFF!

25:38.400 --> 25:41.167
( insects chirping )

26:07.933 --> 26:09.900
( muffled )
I'M--

26:09.933 --> 26:12.133
I'M SO SORRY.
FIRST OF ALL,

26:12.167 --> 26:14.633
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING, OKAY?

26:14.667 --> 26:17.300
MY FRIEND JEFF
DID NOT KNOW--

26:17.333 --> 26:20.900
DID NOT KNOW
THAT THERE WAS
A PENIS IN THAT BOX

26:20.933 --> 26:22.667
WHEN HE PICKED THAT UP
FROM THE BAKERY.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.967
HE CALLED IN THE ORDER
AND THEY GAVE HIM THE BOX.

26:25.067 --> 26:26.800
HE DIDN'T LOOK
INSIDE THE BOX.

26:29.067 --> 26:31.167
HOW'S KEYSHA?

26:32.667 --> 26:35.267
I FINALLY GOT
HER TO SLEEP.
SHE'S UPSET.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.533
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE SHE'S UPSET.

26:37.567 --> 26:40.067
UNDERSTANDABLE.
TO SEE A BIG PENIS
LIKE THAT--

26:40.067 --> 26:42.467
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL.

26:44.067 --> 26:47.400
OKAY, YOU KNOW...

26:47.433 --> 26:49.433
THE SMOKING-IN-THE-HOUSE

26:49.467 --> 26:51.900
I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT.

26:51.933 --> 26:54.667
( mumbling )
UM, IS THERE ANY WAY

26:54.700 --> 26:56.600
MAYBE YOU WOULD
CONSIDER

26:56.633 --> 26:59.567
SMOKING...

26:59.600 --> 27:02.233
OUTSIDE

27:02.267 --> 27:04.067
ON OCCASION?
