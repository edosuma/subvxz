This is the story of
the Smiths' trip to Familyland,

00:39.542 --> 00:42.500
the familiest place on Earth.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.375
Just like the sign says.

00:44.417 --> 00:45.875
Why did I have to read that?

00:45.917 --> 00:47.667
Can't the audience read it?

00:47.709 --> 00:48.750
Oh, they can't.

00:48.792 --> 00:49.834
Right.

00:52.917 --> 00:55.083
It's gonna be
so great to finally

00:55.125 --> 00:56.917
spend some time
as a family.

00:56.959 --> 00:59.291
It seems like we never
get to do that anymore.

00:59.333 --> 01:00.375

talking about?

01:00.417 --> 01:01.750
You're forgetting
our five-week run

01:01.792 --> 01:03.625
as champions
on Family Feud.

01:03.667 --> 01:04.583
Five weeks?

01:04.625 --> 01:06.500
That was all shot
in one afternoon.

01:06.542 --> 01:08.542
Shh. That's a
TV secret.

01:08.583 --> 01:11.291
All I'm saying is that
last time we came here

01:11.333 --> 01:14.083
was one of the best days
this family's had together.

01:14.125 --> 01:15.750
Look how happy we were.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.458
Francine, they
don't care.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.166
They're all on their
mobile devices.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.417
They're in their
own world.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.417
You're right. Stan,
can you please tell them

01:25.458 --> 01:27.333
to put down their iPads
for a second?

01:27.375 --> 01:30.041
Francine, I'm trying to
concentrate on the road.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.500
And I'm on my last lap.

Whatever.

01:38.959 --> 01:40.542

01:40.583 --> 01:43.041
Terrific. No one
cares about me,

01:43.083 --> 01:45.125
they just care
about my cookies.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.959
I don't even care
about your cookies.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.166

Sir, what are you
doing here?

02:13.041 --> 02:15.417
Yeah, Avery, shouldn't you
be here with your family?

02:15.458 --> 02:17.083
I don't have a family.

02:17.125 --> 02:19.375
What about that Indian
baby you have sometimes?

02:19.417 --> 02:21.250
This isn't
one of those times.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.500
But I am a family-phile.

02:23.542 --> 02:25.750
I have a fetish
for family things.

02:25.792 --> 02:28.875
I know the word "fetish"
makes it sound sexual.

02:28.917 --> 02:31.625
Which is good, because it is.

02:32.458 --> 02:35.250
I see you're all together.

02:41.333 --> 02:42.500
Oh, look!

02:42.542 --> 02:44.625
It's Mikey Muskrat

02:44.667 --> 02:46.834
and the founder
of the park, Roy Family.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.750
Wasn't Roy Family
a total weirdo?

02:48.792 --> 02:51.166
Yep, I heard he was
cryogenically frozen

02:51.250 --> 02:52.959
somewhere in the park
and that he used to have

02:53.000 --> 02:55.333
two tamed caterpillars
as a mustache.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.583
Are you sure you're not
talking about Walt Disney?

02:57.625 --> 02:58.625
Who?

02:58.667 --> 03:00.542
Oh, my God,

03:00.583 --> 03:02.542
it smells so yummy
around here.

03:02.583 --> 03:06.417
Ugh, yeah, they pump in pleasant
smells to make you happier

03:06.458 --> 03:08.125
and want to buy things.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.959

03:10.000 --> 03:12.667
Okay, everybody,
what should we do first?

03:12.709 --> 03:13.875
I know what
I'm doing.

03:13.917 --> 03:15.667
Straight to Cartoon City.

03:15.709 --> 03:17.291
It's where
Mikey Muskrat

03:17.333 --> 03:19.000
and all of his
cartoon pals

03:19.041 --> 03:20.792
go about their
daily lives.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.667
They live, they laugh,
they love, they learn.

03:23.709 --> 03:25.083
They're just
like us, really.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.375
Except they
don't bleed,

03:26.417 --> 03:27.792
and most of them
wear bow ties

03:27.834 --> 03:29.208
and gloves
but not pants.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.333
Forget Cartoon City.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.333
I'm gonna go
to Wild Wild West World

03:32.375 --> 03:34.375
and ride
Brokeback Splash Mountain.

03:34.417 --> 03:36.458

dark tunnel

03:36.500 --> 03:37.917
where anything can happen.

looks like?

03:42.500 --> 03:45.792
It's gonna be Ground Control
to Major Lame.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.917
Oh. I guess
that was kinda lame.

03:47.959 --> 03:50.208
Yeah? Well, I'm going
to Fairytale Land

03:50.250 --> 03:52.291
to teach little girls
that princesses

03:52.333 --> 03:54.458
are an outdated
stereotype perpetuated

03:54.500 --> 03:56.583
by a male-dominated
society.

03:56.625 --> 03:58.125
Well, good news.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.875
There's time for us
to do everything together.

04:00.917 --> 04:02.709

and then head over
to Simpler Times Mountain

04:04.709 --> 04:08.709

07:19.166 --> 07:20.500
This is not a show.

07:20.542 --> 07:22.667
Familyland is now a prison.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.542

07:52.959 --> 07:55.750
And so, the Great Wall rose

07:55.792 --> 07:59.250
and Familyland was
thrown into chaos.

08:02.875 --> 08:06.166

all semblance of civilization.

as the kingdom hovered
on the brink of war.

08:26.709 --> 08:30.583
Out of the chaos,
four kings rose to power.

08:30.625 --> 08:35.583
In the north, the Tween King
and his army of whiny turds.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.500
To the east, the Feminist Queen

08:38.542 --> 08:42.166

of splay-legged princesses.

08:42.208 --> 08:44.709
In the south,
a strange-headed man

08:44.750 --> 08:47.458
leads an army
of futuristic astronauts

08:47.500 --> 08:51.041
that are also
somehow old-timey.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.875

the Cowboy King,

08:53.917 --> 08:57.000
Black Stan

I remember it being
very popular.

11:57.875 --> 11:58.959
Well, no one's here.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.041
Let's give it a whirl.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.875
Hello, I'm Pappy Van Pappy.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.625
I'd like to tell you a story

12:08.667 --> 12:11.250
about a rabbit I owned
that ran away.

12:11.291 --> 12:12.625
The rabbit's a metaphor.

12:12.667 --> 12:13.625
For a slave.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.709
Ain't that right,
Floppy Rabbit?

12:15.750 --> 12:18.709
Hmm. This ride
may be a bit dated.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.917
Well, it certainly
has my attention.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.667
And that's when I realized

12:22.709 --> 12:24.959
I like working
on farms for free.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.333
Bye, everybody!

12:26.375 --> 12:27.917
Wow.

12:27.959 --> 12:31.417
25 minutes
of uninterrupted racism.

12:31.458 --> 12:34.250
Yeah, if you don't count
all of your horrified gasps

12:34.250 --> 12:36.083
as interruptions.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.333
I wonder where
that elevator goes.

12:38.375 --> 12:41.041
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.750
Hello, Francine.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.959
Roy Family?

12:48.000 --> 12:48.917
But-but you...

12:48.959 --> 12:50.250
Was frozen?

12:50.291 --> 12:51.875
You're right, I were.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.709
But now I wasn't.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.709
Attention denizens
of Familyland.

12:58.166 --> 13:01.458
Now, times are trying
and rations run low,

13:01.500 --> 13:04.333
and I'm sure all of you'd
really like to go home.

13:04.375 --> 13:08.959
Which is why Uncle Roy's decided
to let the last army standing

13:09.000 --> 13:11.083
walk out the front door.

13:14.166 --> 13:17.041
I'm gonna kill the
last army standing, too.

13:17.083 --> 13:19.792
I just wanted to say
I am a big fan

13:19.834 --> 13:21.792
of Simpler Times Mountain.

13:26.709 --> 13:28.208
I don't understand.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.792
You trapped us
in the park

13:29.834 --> 13:32.458
so you could
watch us all kill each other?

13:32.500 --> 13:35.166
And-and why were you
frozen for 30 years?

13:35.208 --> 13:36.458
Answer that
last one first.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.500
Try not to tell
me what to do.

13:37.542 --> 13:40.250
I built Familyland
to be an Eden,

13:40.291 --> 13:42.625
and I wanted to see it
come to fruition.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.709
So I froze my body,
but not my mind,

13:45.750 --> 13:47.250
right in the center of the park.

13:47.291 --> 13:49.917
That way, I could
watch it all happen.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.333
You were conscious
that whole time?

13:52.375 --> 13:53.917
Oh, yeah,
it was awful.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.500
And I had to watch what
happened to my creation.

13:56.542 --> 13:58.500
My park.

13:58.542 --> 14:02.458
Tainted by people who don't
appreciate the value of family.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.166
So, since they
destroyed my dreams,

14:05.208 --> 14:08.709
they can destroy each other.

14:08.750 --> 14:11.667
But... but
I appreciate family.

14:11.709 --> 14:13.250
That has to count
for something.

14:13.291 --> 14:14.709
It does, Francine.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.291
You and I are of a kind.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.166
Which is why we're going to
watch the blood blath together.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.083
Did you just
say "blath"?

14:21.125 --> 14:23.291
My tongue's been
frozen for 30 years.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.458
But don't worry,
it'll thaw out.

14:31.208 --> 14:34.417
Today, we go from tweens...

14:34.458 --> 14:36.166
to teens!

14:37.250 --> 14:40.208
Today, we fight for respect!

14:41.792 --> 14:44.583
If we fight hard enough,
will we get husbands?

14:44.625 --> 14:46.166
No!

14:46.208 --> 14:49.542
Ugh, okay, I'll explain
this one more time.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.166
Are there
going to be casualties?

14:51.208 --> 14:52.208
Maybe.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.750
But we're mostly grown men,

14:53.792 --> 14:56.166
and one of the armies
is entirely made up of children.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.333
I don't want to jinx it,
but I like our chances

14:58.375 --> 15:01.375
of going completely
casualty-free.

15:01.417 --> 15:03.959
Okay, I just realized
your laser guns aren't real.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.625
So I have a new strategy,

15:05.667 --> 15:07.709
and you're just gonna
have to trust me on this.

15:07.750 --> 15:08.875
Die for me.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.792
Die... for me.

15:10.834 --> 15:11.917
Okay?

15:11.959 --> 15:14.166
Any questions?

15:14.208 --> 15:16.166
No questions, good.

15:20.375 --> 15:21.458
Nice, isn't it?

15:21.458 --> 15:23.125
This is where
we'll live, Francine,

15:23.166 --> 15:24.834
and you'll have
all the love and respect

15:24.875 --> 15:26.250
a woman like you deserves.

15:26.291 --> 15:29.250
What makes you think
I'd ever marry you?

15:29.291 --> 15:30.667
Marry?

15:30.709 --> 15:32.083
Listen to her.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.667
Captive for a half an hour

15:33.709 --> 15:35.959
and already trying
to flip it on me.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.500
Sorry, this guy
can't be caught,

15:38.542 --> 15:40.959
but I encourage you to try.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.125
So why don't you
get going on some dinner.

15:44.166 --> 15:46.750
But you just said
you couldn't be caught.

15:46.792 --> 15:49.291
And then
I encouraged you to try.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.333
I'll be
in the control room

15:50.375 --> 15:52.625
watching your family
kill each other.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.333
Klaus, we have to do something.

15:55.375 --> 15:57.041
They're all gonna
kill each other.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.542
Wait, what are
all these fans?

16:00.375 --> 16:01.875
Look.

16:03.291 --> 16:04.542
Hayley was right.

16:04.583 --> 16:07.041
This is how they send smells
out into the park

16:07.083 --> 16:08.583
to get you to buy things.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.375
That's it.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.834
Hey, Roy, do you have cinnamon?

16:12.875 --> 16:14.625
I want to make some cookies.

It's coming

They stopped fighting.
What did you do?

18:18.375 --> 18:21.208
I baked my ass off.

Francine!

18:36.417 --> 18:39.166
he-he made me
iron his pants.

18:39.208 --> 18:40.917
I don't care
who you are.

18:40.959 --> 18:43.959
Francine only irons
one person's pants,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.458
and that's
all of ours.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.709
Well done.

18:51.750 --> 18:52.625
What?

18:52.667 --> 18:54.917
You're why I
built Familyland.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.834
I wanted a place
where families

18:56.875 --> 18:59.083
would find their
way back together.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.041
You were broken,
but, Francine,

19:01.083 --> 19:04.792
you showed me that the
Smith family is worthy.

19:04.834 --> 19:05.709
Wait, "Smith."

19:05.750 --> 19:08.375
That's not
Jewish, is it?

19:08.417 --> 19:11.667
Then yes, you are indeed
a worthy family.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.750
And, um, here.

19:13.792 --> 19:16.291
Here is
your reward.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.166
Ooh, lifetime
passes.

19:18.208 --> 19:19.333
It was worth it!

19:19.375 --> 19:21.583
It was all worth it!

19:22.959 --> 19:24.458
What will you do now?

19:24.500 --> 19:25.375
Leave your family.

19:25.417 --> 19:26.375
Come live with
me forever.

19:26.417 --> 19:27.375
We'll get an apartment.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.166
What? No.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.083
Then I shall return
to my slumber,

19:31.125 --> 19:35.417
until I'm awakened again
by another family's strife.

19:41.709 --> 19:43.792
Oh, wait, I got to
go to the bathr...

19:46.625 --> 19:49.166
There are a lot of blackout
dates on these lifetime passes.

19:49.208 --> 19:53.125
So, are we just gonna ignore
all the truly horrible things

19:53.166 --> 19:55.000
that took place
in the last week?

19:55.041 --> 19:56.625
Gosh, Francine,
I think we are.

19:56.667 --> 20:00.125
And that was the last
time Familyland was visited

20:00.166 --> 20:01.750
by the Smith family.

20:01.792 --> 20:03.834
Or any family, for that matter,

20:03.875 --> 20:07.542
as it was closed immediately
under a mountain of lawsuits.

20:07.583 --> 20:11.166
In its place stands a memorial
wall for the fallen.

20:11.208 --> 20:15.417
As for me, I was never
heard from again.

20:15.458 --> 20:19.375

see me in the park.
