WEBVTT

00:07.190 --> 00:08.860
Stole that man's watch
right there.

00:08.930 --> 00:10.560
Why don't you
go talk with him?

00:18.940 --> 00:20.300
I'm looking for a guy

00:20.370 --> 00:22.140
who may have come in
a couple days back.

00:22.210 --> 00:23.870
Bartender thought
he may have sat with you.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.110
What's with
the sunglasses, bro?

00:26.180 --> 00:28.350
You got a light
sensitivity or something?

00:28.410 --> 00:30.780
Trying to look cool
over there?

00:30.850 --> 00:32.520
Oh, shit.

00:34.180 --> 00:35.790
You speak to him?

00:35.850 --> 00:37.320
Y-Yes, I have.

00:37.390 --> 00:39.760
You need to get your eye
checked out now.

00:39.820 --> 00:41.390
You sure it was him?

00:41.460 --> 00:42.860
Yeah-- Yes, okay?
I've been waiting

00:42.930 --> 00:44.130
for someone
to come talk to me.

00:44.190 --> 00:45.330
I called 911.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.960
Nobody seemed
to give a shit.

00:47.030 --> 00:48.300
This fuckwad
stole my wallet,

00:48.370 --> 00:50.230
cell phone,
and my watch.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.100
He mention where
he was headed?

00:52.170 --> 00:53.470
Yeah. He wanted me
to help him

00:53.540 --> 00:54.770
figure out how
to get to Albany,

00:54.840 --> 00:56.270
which is bullshit, right?

00:56.340 --> 00:57.810
You're not going
to steal my stuff

00:57.870 --> 01:00.380
and go to the place
where you tell me
you're going.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.150
But I know
where he's going.

01:02.150 --> 01:03.410
You want to know how?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.150
I really just want
to know where--

01:05.180 --> 01:06.550
As soon as I realized
he pinched my shit,

01:06.620 --> 01:08.250
I went out there.
I started asking questions.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.620
I spoke to Donnie.
Donnie said

01:09.690 --> 01:11.490
he saw him walking
to the bus station,

01:11.560 --> 01:13.420
which is good because
I know Gary over
at the bus station.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.790
He sells tickets. Gary
tells me he remembers him,

01:15.860 --> 01:17.160
that he bought a ticket

01:17.160 --> 01:19.160
nowhere near Albany.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.170
Where was he going?

01:21.170 --> 01:22.400
Bridgeport.

01:22.470 --> 01:25.940
Who the fuck goes to
Bridgeport, Connecticut?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.310
Apparently, this guy.

01:34.710 --> 01:36.680
Hey, Cole, you sit
in the parole office.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.420
I got to go
to fucking Bridgeport.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074

02:14.880 --> 02:17.390
If you want
your life to change,

02:17.450 --> 02:19.260
you've got to change.

02:19.320 --> 02:22.490
If you want your life
to get better,

02:22.560 --> 02:24.490
you've got to be better.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.530
You've got to commit
to success.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.070
You've got to say "Okay,

02:29.130 --> 02:30.500
"this is what I want,

02:30.570 --> 02:33.800
and this is how hard
I'll work to get it."

02:52.820 --> 02:54.260
- Baby.
- What?

02:54.320 --> 02:56.260
The door.

02:57.590 --> 02:59.560
Who's there?

03:00.600 --> 03:02.630
- Room service.
- What?

03:04.430 --> 03:07.070
James Bagwell. Remember me?

03:07.140 --> 03:08.870
Oh, shit. Ohh!

03:08.940 --> 03:09.940
Aah!

03:10.010 --> 03:11.040
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:11.110 --> 03:12.440
What-- Stop.
What are you doing?

03:12.510 --> 03:14.040
- You can't come in here.
- No, no, no.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.510
You are wrong, little sister.

03:15.580 --> 03:17.680
I actually have
the legal authority

03:17.750 --> 03:19.180
to go anywhere
Mr. Putnam goes.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.950
I'm bleeding, uh.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.120
Are you?

03:22.190 --> 03:23.190
Aw, you banged
your head, huh?

03:23.290 --> 03:24.520
Looks like it hurts.

03:24.590 --> 03:26.090
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, hey.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.290
- Get off of him.
- Sit down.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.990
- Don't touch him.
- You-- Hey. Shh.

03:33.460 --> 03:34.860
I told you, brother,

03:34.930 --> 03:37.100
if you don't come
to your parole officer,

03:37.170 --> 03:39.100
your parole officer
will come to you.

03:39.170 --> 03:40.670
- Dude, I reported.
- Really?

03:40.740 --> 03:43.110
That's funny because I just
left the halfway house

03:43.170 --> 03:44.510
where you were
supposed to live,

03:44.570 --> 03:46.480
and they told me they have
not seen your ass

03:46.540 --> 03:48.310
- for a week.
- No, that's bullshit.

03:49.410 --> 03:51.320
You remember when you
first came to my office?

03:51.380 --> 03:54.680
I asked you, "Do you
want to be an eagle,

03:54.750 --> 03:57.090
or do you want to be
a shit bird?"

03:57.150 --> 03:58.890
And you said--

03:58.960 --> 04:00.660
I want to be an eagle.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.090
You got to be what you
say you're going to be,

04:03.160 --> 04:04.490
which you aren't.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.230
You got to do what you
say you're going to do,

04:06.330 --> 04:07.760
which you haven't.

04:09.170 --> 04:11.200
Spike, come on, man.

04:11.340 --> 04:13.400
You know the terms
of your parole

04:13.470 --> 04:15.740
strictly prohibit
use of illegal substances.

04:15.810 --> 04:18.380
I-- I got a prescription
for that.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.980
Good for you, sweetie.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.410
But guess what.
Mr. Putnam doesn't.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.820
I am not here to argue.

04:25.880 --> 04:30.250
I am in the business
of making eagles,

04:30.350 --> 04:33.190
and you--
what you are, my friend,

04:33.260 --> 04:35.360
is just a shit bird.

04:41.370 --> 04:44.430
We live in an age
of instant gratification.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.970
We're like junkies
chasing validation.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.070
And as soon as you
get that hit,

04:49.140 --> 04:51.640
we go chasing
after the next one.

04:51.710 --> 04:55.080
But once you get grounded
in who you are,

04:55.140 --> 04:57.950
those results will
start coming to you,

04:58.010 --> 05:00.150
and you won't be
able to stop them.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.920
Later. Sorry. Sorry.

05:01.990 --> 05:04.290
- I'm making eggs.
- I'm late.

05:04.390 --> 05:05.290
You need protein.

05:05.390 --> 05:07.490
- Morning.
- Morning, Pete.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.660
- Later.
- You need protein.

05:09.730 --> 05:10.590
Bye.

05:10.660 --> 05:11.960
Who's going to eat
all of these?

05:12.030 --> 05:14.130
- Right here.
- I'll take some eggs, please.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.600
Of course, Pete.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.970
And thank you
for saying please.

05:18.030 --> 05:19.140
Please.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.170
Doesn't count
when you had to ask.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.870
Jacob's at day care,

05:22.940 --> 05:25.610
and here
is the car seat
and diaper bag.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.140
Uh, did you feed the kids?

05:27.210 --> 05:28.910
Of course I fed the kids.
What kind of question is that?

05:28.980 --> 05:30.550
I don't know, Julia.
You're a single mother.

05:30.610 --> 05:32.080
Your life
is complicated.

05:32.150 --> 05:33.980
How's my big school girl?

05:34.050 --> 05:35.220
I'm not in school.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.690
Grandpa,
if it still okay

05:36.750 --> 05:38.050
for you to pick up
Jacob from day care?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.220
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:39.290 --> 05:40.460
We'll just come
right back here,

05:40.520 --> 05:41.630
and we'll make a fort

05:41.690 --> 05:43.430
out of Taylor's
old Lincoln Logs.

05:43.460 --> 05:44.660
- Yeah.
- I have an errand to run.

05:44.730 --> 05:46.100
Julia's going
to open the shop.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.560
Pete?

05:47.630 --> 05:49.530
Uh, he's going into
the office with me.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.630
- Right?
- Yeah.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.940
Only way to learn
the business.

05:57.070 --> 05:59.080
It's my old boss.

05:59.140 --> 06:00.910
This could get ugly.

06:00.980 --> 06:02.050
One second.

06:02.110 --> 06:04.280
Bring me a couple eggs
when you come back in.

06:04.350 --> 06:05.480
Yes, ma'am.

06:11.190 --> 06:12.290
Hello.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.990
Marius Josepovitch.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.120
Uh, Josepovich.

06:15.190 --> 06:16.290
James Bagwell.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.730
Recognize the name?

06:17.790 --> 06:19.060
Ah, no. I'm sorry.
Who's this?

06:19.130 --> 06:21.030
Your parole officer.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.030
Uh, hi, Mr. Bagwell.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.070
Are you aware
we have a problem?

06:25.130 --> 06:26.340
No, no. I--

06:26.470 --> 06:27.770
Well, what kind
of problem is that?

06:27.840 --> 06:29.610
You got your release
over 48 hours

06:29.670 --> 06:31.140
ago, Josepovitch.

06:31.210 --> 06:32.680
Uh, it's, uh, Josepovich.

06:32.740 --> 06:33.940
Two days out on parole,

06:34.010 --> 06:35.580
and you are already
in violation.

06:35.650 --> 06:38.010
You know, I could throw your
ass back inside right now.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.320
Right, uh, uh,
Mr. Bagwell, I can expl--

06:40.380 --> 06:41.750
Save it. My clients

06:41.820 --> 06:44.490
call me Mr. Success.
You know why?

06:44.550 --> 06:45.920
Because
I help them succeed.

06:45.990 --> 06:47.960
- Why, that's--
- I can't help them unless

06:48.020 --> 06:49.630
they are ready
to help themselves,

06:49.690 --> 06:51.060
so you have to decide.

06:51.130 --> 06:54.500
You want to be an eagle
or a shit bird?

06:54.560 --> 06:57.370
Which is it going to be,
Josepovitch?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.400
I want to be an eagle.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.710
You've got one chance.

07:01.770 --> 07:04.110
You meet me in my office
today at 2:00

07:04.170 --> 07:06.010
p.m. Not 2:01,

07:06.080 --> 07:08.650
not 2:03, But 2:00

07:08.710 --> 07:10.710
p.m. Now say it
back to me.

07:10.780 --> 07:11.580
2 p.m.

07:11.650 --> 07:12.850
Or I will violate you.

07:12.920 --> 07:13.950
Bring
your driver's license

07:14.020 --> 07:15.250
so you can get
through security.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.520
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Bag--

07:44.280 --> 07:46.120
You're going to need
a coat.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.590
It's a beautiful day.

07:48.650 --> 07:51.090
It's going to rain.

07:51.150 --> 07:52.920
The old war wound?

07:52.990 --> 07:54.560
It's never wrong.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.920
But I'm telling you
it's not going to rain.

08:21.790 --> 08:23.590
Have it your way.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.620
You always do.

08:28.190 --> 08:30.130
Get in. Come on.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.830
Sit down.

08:32.900 --> 08:34.260
Get that fucking dog
away from me.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.630
Over here.
There you go.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.130
There you go.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.000
I said sit down.

08:50.450 --> 08:51.480
Fuck you.

08:53.820 --> 08:56.050
Needs to be fucking babysat.

08:57.350 --> 09:00.060
Not part of my
job description.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.200
Is there a problem?

09:11.270 --> 09:12.700
Yeah, matter of fact.

09:12.770 --> 09:15.340
- Why?
- You're in my space.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.540
Wasn't my idea.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.910
Doesn't matter.

09:18.980 --> 09:20.240
As long as you're here,
you're a guest,

09:20.310 --> 09:22.880
and being a guest comes
with responsibilities.

09:22.950 --> 09:25.550
First off, don't fuck
with my stuff.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.650
You get curious about
something, you ask me.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.790
Second, I don't
disrupt my routine

09:29.850 --> 09:31.320
unless Vince says so.

09:31.390 --> 09:32.690
If that inconveniences you,

09:32.760 --> 09:34.460
that's too damn bad.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.730
Finally, do not,
under any circumstances,

09:36.790 --> 09:39.430
speak to me
when my shows are on.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.130
It's how I relax.
End of a long day.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.970
- We clear?
- Why are you pissed at me?

09:44.030 --> 09:45.330
I don't
even want to be here.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.070
Are we clear?

09:47.140 --> 09:48.340
We're clear.

09:49.970 --> 09:51.510
How long do I got to stay?

09:51.570 --> 09:53.040
Till Vince says otherwise.

09:53.110 --> 09:55.240
Isn't Vince the one
you should be pissed at?

09:55.310 --> 09:56.510
Don't go blaming Vince.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.210
Who should I blame?

09:58.280 --> 10:00.320
I don't know. I don't
know what he looks like.

10:00.380 --> 10:01.720
I just have a name.

10:05.620 --> 10:07.590
Ah. Here he is.

10:07.660 --> 10:10.530
Ah. He calls himself
Mr. Success.

10:10.590 --> 10:12.000
Good. Okay,
so remember that face

10:12.060 --> 10:13.460
in case he shows up
at your door.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.300
No, no, no. You promised me
this was going to be simple.

10:16.370 --> 10:17.830
Okay, don't worry about it.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.170
I'm close to getting
some big money, okay?

10:20.240 --> 10:21.640
How big?

10:21.710 --> 10:23.170
There's a safe.
It's full of cash

10:23.240 --> 10:25.170
There's got to be
$100,000 or more.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.110
I'm going to get somebody
to open it this morning

10:27.180 --> 10:28.750
so I can clock
the combination,

10:28.810 --> 10:30.450
and then I got an appointment
with Mr. Success

10:30.510 --> 10:32.080
at 2:00 this afternoon.

10:32.150 --> 10:33.850
So you're going
to run a con this morning

10:33.920 --> 10:35.180
and still get into the city

10:35.250 --> 10:38.050
to meet with your parole
officer by 2? Bullshit.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.020
Okay, so it's ten minutes
to the train station.

10:40.090 --> 10:41.620
Train to the city
is 45 minutes,

10:41.690 --> 10:43.430
and then five minutes
to the parole office.

10:43.490 --> 10:44.490
That's an hour.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.700
Then I set the alarm
on my phone

10:45.760 --> 10:47.230
to give me
an extra 15 minutes.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.800
Katie, I got this.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.320
I want to check the feed
on your security cameras.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.490
I'm looking for a guy.

11:10.550 --> 11:12.560
Came into Bridgeport
on the bus

11:12.620 --> 11:13.990
a couple of days ago.

11:21.770 --> 11:23.800
So you've been arrested.

11:23.870 --> 11:26.400
I beg your pardon?

11:26.470 --> 11:29.310
Judge sets bail at $10,000,

11:29.370 --> 11:30.610
but you don't have it,

11:30.670 --> 11:32.040
so you come to us,
and we do the rest,

11:32.110 --> 11:33.780
as long as you can cover
the down payment

11:33.780 --> 11:34.880
- and provide collateral.
- Right.

11:34.940 --> 11:35.910
So the collateral is--
is what?

11:35.980 --> 11:37.380
We've already gone over this.

11:37.450 --> 11:40.050
Uh, jewelry, a car, a house.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.890
You sign the deed over to us
until the trial's over

11:42.950 --> 11:44.190
or the bond's voided.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.790
So if it's not
a house or a car,

11:45.790 --> 11:47.020
you just put it
in the safe.

11:47.090 --> 11:48.790
I don't put it
in the safe.
Audrey does.

11:48.830 --> 11:50.190
You can't
get in the safe?

11:50.260 --> 11:51.830
- Only Audrey.
- She doesn't trust you?

11:51.900 --> 11:53.500
I don't know if you've
noticed, Petey.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.800
She doesn't trust anybody.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.130
She says it's
for our own safety,

11:56.200 --> 11:57.930
so that nobody can
force us to open it.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.940
So you don't even have
the combination to the safe.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.470
Don't get me started.

12:02.810 --> 12:04.410
And here we go.

12:04.470 --> 12:05.440
Pay attention.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.810
Good morning.
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.

12:09.950 --> 12:10.910
Hi, Mrs. Metzger.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.380
Curb's painted again.

12:12.450 --> 12:14.320
Grandma, let me.

12:14.380 --> 12:15.680
Oh, thank you, Pete.

12:15.820 --> 12:17.850
Just put it down on that
desk over there.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.190
Is he being held
in a--

12:20.260 --> 12:21.620
So what happened
with the curb?

12:21.690 --> 12:23.030
Painted red

12:23.090 --> 12:25.490
so prospective clients
don't know to park there.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.230
Why would anybody
do that?

12:27.300 --> 12:28.330
Payback.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.100
A&B Bail Bonds.
They're mad about losing

12:31.170 --> 12:32.840
the Persikof bond
yesterday.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.870
Somebody painted
the curb again.

12:34.940 --> 12:36.570
Yeah. Good thing
you had the day off.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.840
You can repaint it.

12:37.910 --> 12:39.740
I'm not off. I worked
the second shift.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.850
I just came by
looking for Pete.

12:41.850 --> 12:44.110
It'll only take 20 minutes.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.080
So we still on, right?
Huh?

12:46.150 --> 12:47.280
- Still on for what?
- Pinetop.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.450
You said you'd go
whenever I want.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.020
I did?

12:51.090 --> 12:53.490
- What is this?
- Office supplies.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.890
And Pete's working today.
He's learning the business.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.030
Well, that sucks.
I thought we had a plan.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.870
- Huh? Huh?
- Give me the stapler.

13:01.870 --> 13:04.070
Give me the stapler.
Stop it.

13:04.130 --> 13:07.270
You're getting
staples on me.

13:07.340 --> 13:10.440
Paint and the roller
are in the utility closet.

13:10.510 --> 13:11.440
Fine.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.550
So are we in a feud
with A&B?

13:16.610 --> 13:18.050
You could call it that.

13:18.110 --> 13:22.450
Used to be another
bond shop like us.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.250
Everyone got along.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.560
There was plenty of business,
and we helped each other out.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.960
Taylor even dated
their daughter for a while.

13:29.030 --> 13:30.930
Till I dumped
her stuck-up ass.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.160
Anyway,

13:33.230 --> 13:35.400
after Sean married
into the family,

13:35.460 --> 13:36.800
that all changed.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.670
Whatever else he is,
he is not lazy.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.440
Business took off,
and pretty soon,

13:40.500 --> 13:42.310
they were
buying out bond shops

13:42.370 --> 13:43.370
all over the state.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.110
Now they're the biggest
in Connecticut,

13:45.170 --> 13:46.580
and they're out
to bankrupt us.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.450
Libby Metzger wants
to get her son out of jail.

13:49.510 --> 13:51.950
- Which one?
- Troy, the baby.

13:52.020 --> 13:53.480
She knows where we are.

13:53.550 --> 13:55.750
Well, she's house bound
with a broken ankle.

13:55.820 --> 13:57.790
She wants to know
if we can go to her

13:57.920 --> 13:58.990
to write
the bail package.

13:59.060 --> 14:00.060
I ran a new credit check.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.720
She says
she has collateral.

14:01.790 --> 14:02.760
Okay. I'll go.

14:02.830 --> 14:04.290
Knowing Libby,

14:04.360 --> 14:06.500
it's silverware and jewelry,
same as before.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.930
Well, if you want,
yeah, I can go with you.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.970
You can show me
how to write up a bond.

14:11.030 --> 14:12.970
I thought that's
what we were doing

14:13.040 --> 14:14.540
here in the office.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.840
Julia, don't begrudge me
time with my grandson.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.280
It's been 20 years
for goodness' sake.

14:20.340 --> 14:21.310
Yeah. Good.

14:21.380 --> 14:22.750
The only thing is

14:22.810 --> 14:24.250
I finally convinced
my former employer

14:24.310 --> 14:25.450
to release
my final paycheck,

14:25.510 --> 14:27.280
so I just have to go
to the city at 2:00

14:27.350 --> 14:28.420
to pick it up.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.420
Shouldn't take an hour
at the Metzgers'.

14:30.490 --> 14:33.090
We'll be back by 12:30.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.770
Okay, asshole.

14:46.840 --> 14:51.810
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

14:51.870 --> 14:53.510
- So, Pete.
- Yeah.

14:53.580 --> 14:56.410
If we write an $18,000
bond check today,

14:56.480 --> 14:58.750
- what's our commission?
- $1,800.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.350
And after taxes, rent,
electricity, insurance,

15:01.420 --> 15:03.120
salaries, and gas,
how long do you think

15:03.190 --> 15:06.390
we can keep the lights on
for $1,800?

15:06.460 --> 15:08.990
You had some idea
we were rich.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.660
All these years
since we saw each other.

15:14.730 --> 15:18.000
Who would imagine
we'd be working
together like this?

15:19.270 --> 15:21.700
- Pete, are you listening?
- Yeah. Sorry.

15:21.770 --> 15:24.210
We really appreciate you
stepping up for the family.

15:24.270 --> 15:26.180
Well, it's--
it's what you do.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.740
It's just,
after all these years,

15:28.810 --> 15:30.910
so many unanswered questions.

15:31.010 --> 15:33.550
Uh, ma'am?

15:33.620 --> 15:35.320
Oh, here we are.

15:47.430 --> 15:50.530
1,780, 1,790...

15:51.830 --> 15:53.940
It's 1,800.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.910
Now we need collateral
to secure the bond.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.210
Going to use the house.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.580
Afraid we can't do that.

16:01.640 --> 16:02.850
Sure we can.

16:02.910 --> 16:04.810
Libby, you took out
a second mortgage.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.480
You don't have equity
in the property.

16:06.550 --> 16:07.820
It's all debt.

16:07.880 --> 16:08.820
Told you, Mama.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.450
Derek, shut up.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.460
Look around.
There's four walls.

16:16.530 --> 16:18.690
- There's a roof.
- And it all belongs
to the bank.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.600
How am I going to bail
Troy out of jail?

16:20.660 --> 16:21.600
He got himself in there.

16:21.660 --> 16:24.070
How about you
just go out there

16:24.100 --> 16:25.700
and mow the grass
like I asked you?

16:25.770 --> 16:28.270
- That's Troy's job.
- You see Troy around here?

16:28.340 --> 16:29.840
- No.
- Excuse me?

16:29.910 --> 16:32.080
- No, ma'am.
- He isn't here, is he?

16:32.110 --> 16:34.410
We need $1,800
and collateral.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.250
Didn't you have some
wedding silver and jewelry?

16:37.310 --> 16:39.350
Nothing she ain't
already sold on eBay.

16:39.420 --> 16:42.220
If I have to
one more time--

16:42.290 --> 16:43.550
...busted ankle or no,

16:43.620 --> 16:45.520
I'm going to climb
up out of this chair

16:45.590 --> 16:47.220
and skin you.

16:47.290 --> 16:50.490
Listen, Troy isn't
going to run.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.490
I guarantee it.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.230
Libby, your word isn't enough.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.100
I guess I'm just
going to have to call

16:55.130 --> 16:56.670
one of those other
bond agencies.

16:56.730 --> 16:59.870
What's the one
with the fellow
on the billboards?

16:59.940 --> 17:01.240
- A&B. Heh heh.
- See?

17:01.300 --> 17:02.510
Yeah, that dude is funny.

17:02.570 --> 17:04.569
Nobody is going to bond
Troy without collateral.

17:04.640 --> 17:08.339
If he ran, they'd have to
pay the court $18,000.

17:08.410 --> 17:09.550
Excuse me.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.720
Where'd you get this clock?

17:12.780 --> 17:14.750
I don't remember.

17:14.819 --> 17:16.589
It was Daddy's.

17:16.650 --> 17:18.349
That's right.

17:18.420 --> 17:21.390
That came from
Mr. Metzger's family.

17:21.460 --> 17:22.530
Why?

17:23.890 --> 17:25.490
Well, this is
a Shake & Irwin.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.329
Shake & Irwin were famous
for their grandfather clocks,

17:28.400 --> 17:31.530
but this is the only mantel
clock they ever produced.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.140
There's not a lot
of these around anymore.

17:36.470 --> 17:38.140
Have you had it appraised?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.480
I never thought to.

17:39.540 --> 17:40.780
Is it valuable?

17:40.840 --> 17:45.180
Well, the ones that Mr. Shake
made personally are.

17:45.250 --> 17:49.190
You can tell
because he carved an X
on the bottom of it.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.160
Yes, please.

18:09.270 --> 18:12.410
Oh, my God. There it is.

18:13.580 --> 18:15.180
Wow.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.550
Looks like Mr. Metzger left
you quite the legacy there.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.350
An original Shake
in this condition

18:22.420 --> 18:24.020
is easily worth $22-$23,000.

18:24.090 --> 18:25.950
T--

18:26.020 --> 18:28.390
There's your collateral.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.060
We'll do the paperwork

18:30.190 --> 18:32.230
and have Troy home
in time to cut the grass.

18:32.300 --> 18:36.200
Ah. I don't know. That--
It was Mr. Metzger's.

18:36.230 --> 18:37.700
You'll get a receipt.

18:37.770 --> 18:40.200
And we'll take it
back to the office

18:40.270 --> 18:41.770
and put it in the safe.

18:45.810 --> 18:48.880
You learned about clocks
at that insurance company?

18:48.940 --> 18:51.050
Oh. "Antiques Roadshow."

18:51.110 --> 18:52.580
Yeah.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.020
You hungry?

18:55.080 --> 18:57.090
- What?
- Let's get lunch.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.690
You know, I'd love to,

18:58.750 --> 19:00.290
but I got to go get
that paycheck.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.330
Oh, have them send it to you.

19:10.470 --> 19:11.730
You know, Grandma,

19:11.800 --> 19:13.740
I think I am going
to have to skip lunch.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.970
I-- They'll probably want me
to have to sign for the--

19:16.040 --> 19:18.910
- for the check.
- Well, find out. Call them.

19:18.970 --> 19:20.340
I-- I think
it's better that I--

19:20.410 --> 19:21.580
Unless you don't
want to be seen

19:21.640 --> 19:22.980
having lunch
with your grandmother.

19:23.050 --> 19:24.280
I didn't say that.
Did I say that?

19:24.350 --> 19:25.950
Then call.

19:33.990 --> 19:35.460
Hi. This is Pete Murphy.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.890
I'm calling
for Sandy Loomis.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.300
Uh, yeah. Sure.

19:42.870 --> 19:46.000
Hi, Miss Loomis.
This is Pete Murphy calling.

19:46.070 --> 19:47.400
Yeah, I'm sorry
to-- to bother you--

19:47.470 --> 19:48.870
- Pete, let me.
- What?

19:48.940 --> 19:49.970
Give me the phone.

19:51.710 --> 19:52.580
Hi, Miss Loomis.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.040
This is Audrey Bernhardt,

19:54.110 --> 19:55.540
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.

19:55.610 --> 19:56.980
I understand
you're holding

19:57.050 --> 19:59.480
a final paycheck
for Pete Murphy.

19:59.550 --> 20:03.320
Uh, yes, Miss Bernhardt,
that is correct.

20:03.390 --> 20:06.490
Is there any
reason
why you can't just mail
that paycheck to him

20:06.560 --> 20:07.860
instead of making him

20:07.920 --> 20:09.060
go to all the trouble

20:09.120 --> 20:10.890
to come in and sign for it?

20:10.960 --> 20:11.930
I'll need

20:11.990 --> 20:14.230
to speak to Mr. Murphy again

20:14.300 --> 20:16.970
to verify some
additional information.

20:17.030 --> 20:18.470
Of course. Hold on.

20:18.530 --> 20:20.740
You're on speaker.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.340
Mr. Murphy,
can you hear me?

20:23.410 --> 20:25.770
Yeah. Yeah, I can--
Yeah. That's it.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.840
Yeah, I can--
Yeah, I can hear you.

20:27.910 --> 20:30.980
You have put me in a very
awkward position here.

20:31.050 --> 20:32.350
Well,
I'm sorry about that.

20:32.420 --> 20:35.380
I have new responsibilities
in a new job, and--

20:35.450 --> 20:36.990
Well, I'm sure you do.

20:37.050 --> 20:38.390
Well, then I don't see

20:38.450 --> 20:40.020
how I can say no,

20:40.090 --> 20:41.620
as much as I would like to.

20:41.690 --> 20:43.990
Thank you very much.
That's very gracious
of you.

20:44.060 --> 20:46.360
What would you suggest
I do with the check?

20:46.430 --> 20:50.530
You can send it to
6325 Quiet Oak Highway,

20:50.600 --> 20:52.570
Trumble, Connecticut,
06614.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.870
- Thank you.
- Glad I could help.

20:54.940 --> 20:57.110
Okay. Okay.

20:57.170 --> 20:58.940
Now we can enjoy
a nice lunch.

20:59.010 --> 21:00.310
That's great.

21:00.380 --> 21:03.410
I don't think Miss Loomis
much cares for you.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.510
Yeah, we had issues.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.270
What's the play?

21:32.380 --> 21:34.610
I'm not sure.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.010
We should maybe keep moving

21:37.080 --> 21:38.910
so they don't clock us.

21:38.980 --> 21:40.520
Ah, Farley, I'm just--

21:40.580 --> 21:42.550
I'm just starting to think
I'm just an old fool.

21:42.620 --> 21:44.890
No, you're good people,
Mr. B.

21:44.950 --> 21:46.890
Letting me work
the bond off like this.

21:48.290 --> 21:50.260
You want me to drive
around the block?

21:50.390 --> 21:53.230
How about we just go
pick up Jacob?

21:53.300 --> 21:55.030
Whatever you say, boss.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.970
Uh, I have to-- I have to
use the bathroom, Grandma.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.010
Don't need my permission.

22:19.090 --> 22:21.220
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.060
New York County
Parole Office.

22:23.130 --> 22:24.490
Hi. This is Marius Josepovich.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.760
I had an appointment today

22:25.830 --> 22:27.430
with Mr. Bagwell at 2:00,

22:27.460 --> 22:28.730
and I've had a little bit
of an emergency.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.430
I was wondering
if there was any chance

22:30.500 --> 22:31.970
to reschedule
perhaps later today.

22:32.030 --> 22:34.240
Uh, Mr. Bagwell doesn't
like us to change times.

22:34.300 --> 22:37.240
I'm sorry. Could you
hold on for one sec?
Honey, it's okay.

22:37.310 --> 22:38.670
Everything's
going to be fine.

22:38.740 --> 22:40.010
That's my daughter.
She was really upset.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.710
- I apologize.
- No problem.

22:41.780 --> 22:43.710
I've got an 8-year-old.
I know how it goes.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.210
Actually,
it's my stepdaughter.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.080
She's uh--
She's 10 years old.

22:47.150 --> 22:48.750
Uh, sorry.
What was your name?

22:48.820 --> 22:49.790
Liz.

22:49.850 --> 22:50.750
Well, Liz,

22:50.820 --> 22:52.350
we were walking home
from school today,

22:52.460 --> 22:54.820
and my daughter found
the most adorable
little calico kitten

22:54.890 --> 22:56.690
you've ever seen
in your life.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.090
I don't have to tell you

22:58.160 --> 22:59.530
how little girls are
with kittens, right?

22:59.600 --> 23:01.160
- Darcy has a kitty.
- Well, then you know

23:01.230 --> 23:02.470
exactly what I'm
talking about.

23:02.500 --> 23:03.900
Anyway, this little guy
was hit by a car.

23:03.970 --> 23:05.570
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

23:05.630 --> 23:07.300
And we're at the animal
hospital right now.

23:07.370 --> 23:08.670
He's in surgery, but--

23:08.740 --> 23:10.070
Honey, I'm just
telling the nice lady

23:10.140 --> 23:12.140
what happened. Anyways,
I'm just wondering

23:12.210 --> 23:13.740
if there's, uh, at all

23:13.810 --> 23:15.280
any chance
for an appointment

23:15.340 --> 23:16.510
later this afternoon.

23:16.580 --> 23:18.150
Let me check his schedule.

23:18.210 --> 23:19.310
Thank you so much.

23:19.380 --> 23:20.520
Thank you. Thank you.

23:20.580 --> 23:21.950
Yo! Come on!

23:22.020 --> 23:23.650
Occupied! Sorry.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.890
He has an opening at 4:30.

23:25.950 --> 23:26.960
4:30's great.

23:27.020 --> 23:27.920
That's perfect.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.590
Uh, the name's
Marius Josepovich.

23:29.660 --> 23:32.060
Now I have to
confirm this change
with Mr. Bagwell.

23:32.130 --> 23:34.060
You don't need to call me
unless there's a problem.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.600
Huh.

23:39.670 --> 23:42.570
Funny you asking
about Mr. Josepovich.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.970
You're telling me
that was him just now?

23:44.040 --> 23:46.140
Mm-hmm. Rescheduled
his appointment

23:46.210 --> 23:47.840
to 4:30 this afternoon.

23:51.350 --> 23:55.050
You always used to say
tuna made you feel barfy.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.650
Well, that was
20 years ago, Grandma.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.860
That's right.
People change.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.860
You're not our
little Pete anymore.

24:07.430 --> 24:10.870
You know, the bail business
isn't all that complicated.

24:10.930 --> 24:13.770
Anyone can learn
the nuts and bolts.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.770
But there's one instinct

24:15.840 --> 24:17.670
that separates
the great bail bondsmen

24:17.740 --> 24:19.340
- from the rest.
- What's that?

24:19.410 --> 24:21.710
You got to be able to look
a prospective client in the eye

24:21.780 --> 24:24.880
and ask yourself
"Is this someone I trust?"

24:26.010 --> 24:28.120
Sometimes
the numbers add up.

24:28.180 --> 24:29.890
But a little voice
in the back of your head

24:29.950 --> 24:31.950
says "Something's
not right.

24:32.020 --> 24:35.860
and if I trust this person,
'I'll regret it."

24:41.130 --> 24:43.670
Is there something
you want to ask me, Grandma?

24:43.730 --> 24:47.570
I can't help
but wonder, Pete.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.570
Your grandpa
had his stroke,

24:49.610 --> 24:52.640
and then suddenly you
break a 20-year silence.

24:52.710 --> 24:55.610
You always thought
we were rich.

24:55.680 --> 24:59.150
So I can't help wonder

24:59.210 --> 25:02.050
if you came back looking
to take advantage of us.

25:08.190 --> 25:10.230
You're right, Grandma.

25:10.290 --> 25:12.860
I did hear about the stroke.

25:12.930 --> 25:13.860
How?

25:17.900 --> 25:19.600
Well, for the last
several years,

25:19.600 --> 25:21.470
I've been thinking
about the summers

25:21.600 --> 25:23.070
I spent here.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.640
You remember
what it was like--

25:26.710 --> 25:29.280
that green,
that shade of green.

25:36.320 --> 25:39.050
It was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.020
And the tire swing.

25:42.060 --> 25:43.760
It used to break
every summer,

25:43.830 --> 25:45.790
and every summer
Grandpa would fix it.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.260
And the apples.

25:49.700 --> 25:52.230
Apples just aren't
the same anymore, Grandma.

25:53.370 --> 25:54.900
Not since we lost
that old tree.

26:00.910 --> 26:02.540
I'm not going to lie
to you.

26:02.650 --> 26:05.850
I was in a really bad place.

26:05.910 --> 26:08.650
I did things that I was
not proud of.

26:10.290 --> 26:12.250
I was really empty inside.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.660
So...

26:15.460 --> 26:17.290
I went on Facebook,

26:17.360 --> 26:18.660
and I found Julia.

26:18.730 --> 26:20.760
Just read her posts

26:20.830 --> 26:25.000
because I-- I was sort of
ashamed of who I'd become.

26:25.070 --> 26:26.840
And then one day
there it was.

26:26.900 --> 26:29.140
"Grandpa had a stroke."

26:30.570 --> 26:34.240
I knew that I could never
forgive myself

26:34.310 --> 26:36.110
if I didn't reach out.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.980
Just took me a while
to figure out how.

26:45.690 --> 26:47.220
That's
the God's honest truth.

26:47.290 --> 26:48.690
Oh, Pete.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.260
I'm so sorry.

26:51.330 --> 26:52.760
Can you give me
one moment, please?

26:52.830 --> 26:54.360
I'm sorry.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.710
Josepovitch,

27:02.740 --> 27:04.610
this is Mr. Bagwell.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.010
I heard about the kitten,

27:06.070 --> 27:08.140
and it sounds
like bullshit to me.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.180
But you got yourself
rescheduled,

27:10.250 --> 27:11.310
so let me be clear.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.750
If you're not
in the waiting room

27:12.820 --> 27:16.520
at 4:30--
not 4:31, not 4:33--

27:16.580 --> 27:17.750
at 4:30,

27:17.820 --> 27:20.390
you go back to jail today.

27:22.090 --> 27:23.060
Okay.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.570
Every kiss,

27:30.630 --> 27:32.870
every moment that we had
was a lie.

27:32.940 --> 27:35.100
Is that what you
want me to say?

27:35.170 --> 27:38.010
You're playing head games?
Is the baby Nick's or not?

27:38.070 --> 27:39.570
Let your brother
handle this--

27:39.640 --> 27:41.110
I have to take
Hush Puppy for a walk

27:41.180 --> 27:43.580
and go to the pet store.
Stand up.

27:43.650 --> 27:44.850
Huh?

27:46.310 --> 27:48.150
Aah! What-- Dude--

27:48.220 --> 27:49.580
Put your hands
behind your back.

27:49.650 --> 27:51.850
Dude, what the fuck?
This is ridiculous.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.620
- It's not ridiculous.
- Where am I gonna go--

27:53.760 --> 27:54.760
Ow!

27:54.790 --> 27:57.130
- And your feet.
- No.

27:57.190 --> 27:58.660
I'm just an opportunist
at your father's--

27:58.760 --> 28:00.830
I'm not going to excape.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.260
Oh, absolutely.

28:02.330 --> 28:03.670
...just wanted to be
a part of your family.

28:03.770 --> 28:05.270
Abso-freaking-lutely.

28:05.330 --> 28:06.230
Ow!

28:06.300 --> 28:07.840
I just want
to meet my child--

28:07.900 --> 28:09.040
Oh, don't you think

28:09.100 --> 28:11.210
that's just a little bit
excessive?

28:11.270 --> 28:14.140
Look, what am I gonna--
Mm!

28:14.210 --> 28:15.640
Enjoy your show.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.250
Doesn't matter anyway,
does it?

28:17.310 --> 28:18.880
Let's go, Hush Puppy.

28:18.950 --> 28:20.450
Because whether this baby's
yours or Adam's--

28:20.520 --> 28:21.850
Come on, girl.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.090
Come on, girl.

28:28.220 --> 28:30.030
Uh, just put it down on that--

28:30.090 --> 28:32.230
- that desk over there.
- Sure, yeah.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.140
Uh, I'm opening
the safe now,

28:42.200 --> 28:44.610
so you can step--
step over there.

28:44.670 --> 28:46.440
Oh, sure. Yeah.

28:57.690 --> 28:59.590
Oh, hey,
you guys are back.

28:59.650 --> 29:01.260
Safe's open. Stay there.

29:05.430 --> 29:07.400
How was the field trip?

29:07.460 --> 29:08.830
It was good.

29:08.860 --> 29:09.870
He found
an antique clock

29:09.930 --> 29:10.870
we're using
for collateral.

29:10.930 --> 29:12.030
Impressive.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.170
Sounds like he's
a natural.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.970
Well, you're a natural,
too, Julia.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.340
Just a different kind.

29:18.410 --> 29:19.510
Hmm.

29:19.570 --> 29:22.610
Uh, Pete, how about, um,

29:22.680 --> 29:24.150
walking me
down to the corner?

29:24.210 --> 29:26.310
I got to get some
diapers and stuff.

29:26.380 --> 29:27.620
Yeah. Sure.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.320
- Yeah?
- I've got-- Go ahead.

29:29.380 --> 29:31.320
I'm just going to put my
feet up for a few minutes

29:31.390 --> 29:34.520
and then go get
Mr. Metzger out of jail.

29:34.590 --> 29:35.890
Okay.

29:49.140 --> 29:51.010
I've left you
several messages.

29:51.070 --> 29:52.880
I need you
to call me back.

29:52.910 --> 29:55.440
I was supposed to be
out of this by now.

29:55.510 --> 29:58.510
Promise me you won't
fire me when you take over.

29:58.580 --> 30:00.050
What do you mean?

30:00.120 --> 30:03.390
You're the great white hope
of the bail bond business.

30:03.450 --> 30:06.150
Oh. Yeah, well, I'm sure
we can work something out.

30:06.220 --> 30:08.920
Well, nothing inappropriate
because, you know,

30:08.990 --> 30:11.260
we're cousins.

30:11.330 --> 30:13.730
Obviously, yeah.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.060
I'm going in here.

30:15.130 --> 30:16.700
I got to get some cigarettes.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.230
I thought it was diapers.

30:18.300 --> 30:20.300
Yeah, I didn't want
a lecture from Audrey.

30:20.370 --> 30:21.900
Hey, Julia,

30:21.970 --> 30:23.410
I'm not going
to take your job.

30:23.470 --> 30:25.540
I think you're really
good at your job.

30:25.610 --> 30:26.710
You're just being nice.

30:26.770 --> 30:29.580
Come on. Is this
the face of a liar?

30:31.150 --> 30:33.350
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.120
Fuck.

30:39.690 --> 30:41.490
Oh! Ohh!

30:57.910 --> 30:59.670
Hey, Grandpa.
How was your day?

30:59.740 --> 31:02.040
Shh!

31:02.110 --> 31:05.450
Jacob's having a nap.

31:05.510 --> 31:08.850
I've been playing
with him all day.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.990
I tuckered him out.

31:11.850 --> 31:12.820
You hungry?

31:12.960 --> 31:14.960
- Yeah.
- Well--

31:28.100 --> 31:29.540
Is Vince here?

31:29.600 --> 31:31.340
Is Vince here?

31:31.410 --> 31:32.980
Uhh!

31:32.980 --> 31:34.280
Is Vince here?

31:34.340 --> 31:36.210
Is Vince-- Is Vince coming?

31:43.120 --> 31:44.520
Welcome to Pinetop!

31:44.590 --> 31:45.820
Oh!

31:45.890 --> 31:47.860
I told you, man,
we got to hang out!

31:47.990 --> 31:49.760
What the fuck--

31:49.820 --> 31:51.990
Look at your
fucking face, man.

31:51.990 --> 31:54.030
Are you out of your
fucking mind, Taylor?

31:54.100 --> 31:55.330
Look at your fucking face!

31:55.400 --> 31:56.800
You scared the shit out of me!

31:56.860 --> 31:58.300
I know!
It was fucking amazing!

31:58.370 --> 31:59.830
Are you out of your
fucking mind?

31:59.900 --> 32:01.000
Whoa, bro. Hey--

32:01.000 --> 32:02.570
You need to see a doctor.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.170
- This is not normal.
- No, but--

32:04.240 --> 32:05.840
I'm serious! People
don't do this shit!

32:05.910 --> 32:07.810
- Hey. Hey.
- They're going to
kill somebody!

32:07.880 --> 32:09.010
- Wait.
- Oh, my God!

32:09.010 --> 32:10.080
Wait. Wait, wait.

32:10.150 --> 32:11.250
Wait. That--

32:11.310 --> 32:12.780
That's what you thought?

32:12.850 --> 32:14.480
Where the fuck are we, man?

32:14.550 --> 32:16.520
Who's Vince, man?

32:16.580 --> 32:19.490
What, you call
this place Pinetop?

32:19.550 --> 32:20.490
Where are the pines?

32:20.560 --> 32:21.860
Hey, man, don't
change the subject.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.030
When you were
under the hood,

32:23.060 --> 32:24.130
you said something about--

32:24.190 --> 32:26.360
worried about some guy
named Vince.

32:26.430 --> 32:29.030
What kind of trouble
are you in, man?

32:31.330 --> 32:32.400
Okay.

32:32.470 --> 32:34.040
I'm going to tell you
something, all right?

32:34.070 --> 32:35.400
You got to promise
not to tell anybody.

32:35.470 --> 32:37.040
- Yeah. Of course.
- Cross your heart.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.240
- My own fucking heart, man.
- Yeah.

32:44.050 --> 32:46.250
I'm seeing a girl.

32:46.310 --> 32:48.620
Her husband's name
is Vince.

32:50.290 --> 32:52.350
- Oh, fuck.
- You know what I mean?

32:52.420 --> 32:55.120
Yeah. No.
A married woman, huh?

32:55.190 --> 32:57.060
- Yeah.
- No. I get it. It's gnarly.

32:57.090 --> 32:58.290
I love her, Taylor.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.760
Dude, I'm not gonna
tell anybody, okay?

33:02.130 --> 33:03.900
- My phone.
- I'm sorry.

33:03.970 --> 33:06.070
I had no idea.
It's not--

33:06.070 --> 33:07.700
Where's my phone?

33:07.770 --> 33:09.940
Uh, Taylor, can you take me
to the train station?

33:10.070 --> 33:11.810
What-- Uh, for what?

33:11.870 --> 33:14.310
Can we just go to the
fucking train station?

33:14.380 --> 33:16.280
- Okay! Okay! Fine!
- Thank you.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.480
How many times
has this happened to you?

33:21.720 --> 33:23.350
Spending way too much time
in the kitchen

33:23.420 --> 33:24.520
looking for the perfect pan

33:24.590 --> 33:26.350
to solve
your cooking problems.

33:26.420 --> 33:28.220
If you're like most people,

33:28.290 --> 33:30.890
you have cupboards
full of old pans

33:30.960 --> 33:32.330
that just
don't do the trick.

33:32.390 --> 33:35.160
You need the one pan
that can do it all.

33:45.510 --> 33:46.470
Cousin Pete?

34:16.540 --> 34:18.370
Where's your
sense of humor, man?

34:18.440 --> 34:19.670
When we were kids,
you would have thought--

34:19.739 --> 34:21.139
You know what?
We're not kids anymore.

34:21.179 --> 34:22.510
No shit, Sherlock.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.310
But I-- Whatever.

34:24.380 --> 34:27.150
I'm just glad
Julia's not here.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.179
What do you mean by that?

34:29.250 --> 34:30.850
This was her idea, man.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.590
She set you up.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.620
That whole story
about going to the store

34:34.690 --> 34:36.159
for diapers.

34:36.190 --> 34:37.690
What the fuck is wrong
with this family?

34:37.760 --> 34:38.690
Raah!

35:23.240 --> 35:25.640
- A little help.
- Be right there.

35:29.810 --> 35:31.950
NYPD.

35:32.010 --> 35:33.580
Cool cats.

35:33.650 --> 35:35.720
To what
do we owe the honor?

35:35.780 --> 35:39.520
You bust balls before
I even open my mouth?

35:39.590 --> 35:41.220
Welcome to Bridgeport,
detective.

35:41.220 --> 35:42.960
How can I be of service?

35:43.020 --> 35:46.660
Looking for a guy who blew
into town couple of days ago.

35:53.470 --> 35:55.640
Be right back.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.810
Can't wait.

36:00.410 --> 36:01.710
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.040
Where the hell are you?

36:03.110 --> 36:04.550
I got him on video

36:04.610 --> 36:07.550
getting off a bus in
Bridgeport two days ago.

36:08.480 --> 36:09.880
You're in Bridgeport?

36:09.950 --> 36:11.420
- Yeah.
- What,

36:11.490 --> 36:14.590
just driving around hoping
you'll bump into him?

36:14.660 --> 36:16.260
I'm checking
with the local police.

36:16.290 --> 36:18.330
I'm telling you,
Vince, he's here.

36:18.390 --> 36:19.730
I can feel it.

36:19.790 --> 36:20.930
Right.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.300
Well, you know that stakeout

36:22.360 --> 36:23.400
I insisted on?

36:23.470 --> 36:24.530
I left Cole on it.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.730
Well, he just called.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.940
Turns out Marius has
an appointment there

36:28.000 --> 36:29.500
this afternoon at 4:30.

36:29.570 --> 36:31.070
Fuck.

36:31.140 --> 36:33.310
So get in your cop car,

36:33.380 --> 36:35.280
put on your cop light,

36:35.280 --> 36:38.280
and get your cop ass
back here right now.

36:46.990 --> 36:47.990
Aah!

37:41.210 --> 37:42.340
Yeah.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.050
Marius, it's me.

37:44.110 --> 37:45.950
Eddie, where are you?

37:46.010 --> 37:47.550
I'm on the roof
of Richard's building.

37:47.620 --> 37:50.120
I got away, bro.
Look, look, look, look.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.490
As soon as I hang up,
I'm going to jump
to the next building.

37:52.550 --> 37:53.760
How did you get away?

37:53.820 --> 37:55.220
Richard took the dog
for a walk.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.360
Look, I'm on a cordless,

37:56.390 --> 37:57.430
and I'm gonna lose signal.

37:57.490 --> 37:58.590
Where do you want to meet?

37:58.660 --> 37:59.760
Do they know you're gone?

37:59.830 --> 38:01.560
- No, not yet.
- Go back.

38:01.630 --> 38:04.270
- What did you say? Go back?
- Eddie,

38:04.370 --> 38:06.030
go back before
they know you're gone.

38:06.100 --> 38:07.440
No, I can't do that,

38:07.500 --> 38:09.770
Marius. They already sicced
the fucking dog on me

38:09.840 --> 38:11.470
and broke
my goddamn nose, man!

38:11.540 --> 38:13.740
- What?
- Because I tried to
get away last night.

38:13.810 --> 38:15.580
Eddie, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.910
You've got to go back.

38:16.980 --> 38:19.010
Look, I'm gonna get you
out of this, okay?

38:19.080 --> 38:20.620
I'm close to the money.

38:20.680 --> 38:21.920
How close?

38:21.980 --> 38:23.820
It's a day or two
at the most.

38:23.890 --> 38:25.620
But if you take off now,
we're gonna be on the run

38:25.690 --> 38:28.090
from Vince and the cops
forever, all right?

38:29.560 --> 38:31.160
You just got to trust me
on this, all right?

38:31.230 --> 38:33.160
Look, this is the best option.

38:33.230 --> 38:35.100
Please? Go back.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.410
Fuck!

39:14.570 --> 39:16.670
- Come on!
- Hey!

39:39.030 --> 39:40.500
Bagwell.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.630
Mr. Bagwell...

39:42.700 --> 39:45.170
it's Marius Josepovich.

39:45.230 --> 39:47.200
I'm as sick as a dog.

39:47.270 --> 39:48.540
You don't say.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.140
I don't know what happened.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.670
It started after lunch.

39:53.370 --> 39:54.640
Where are you?

39:54.710 --> 39:56.840
- I'm, uh, in bed.
- What?

39:56.910 --> 39:59.510
See, I didn't want
to come into your office

39:59.580 --> 40:00.920
and get everybody sick.

40:00.980 --> 40:03.850
Yeah, well, that's, uh,
very considerate of you.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.350
Find him, Cole.

40:05.420 --> 40:06.790
I'll tell you what,
Josepovich.

40:06.850 --> 40:08.520
You rest up, and if you
feel better tomorrow,

40:08.590 --> 40:10.830
you give me a call
and we'll reschedule.

40:10.890 --> 40:13.130
In the meantime,
take care of yourself.

40:13.190 --> 40:16.200
Okay. Thank you.

40:24.740 --> 40:26.910
Hey, Liz,
grab my calls, will you?

40:26.970 --> 40:30.910
I got to go to White Plains
and violate a shit bird.

40:33.450 --> 40:34.850
Oh, hang on Hush Puppy.

40:34.920 --> 40:36.550
Hold on. There we go.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.250
Son of a bitch.

40:38.320 --> 40:41.920
Motherfucker.

40:44.030 --> 40:46.830
- Hey.
- God damn it, Eddie.
What the fuck?

40:46.890 --> 40:48.360
I had to take a crap.

40:48.430 --> 40:50.400
I was desperate.

40:50.460 --> 40:51.800
You expect me to believe that?

40:51.870 --> 40:53.500
Next time I'll take
a shit on your couch

40:53.570 --> 40:55.300
if that's how you're
going to be. Jesus.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.800
Nobody runs in your family.

40:58.940 --> 41:00.910
You were trying to escape.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.140
I was what?

41:02.210 --> 41:05.310
If I was going to excape,
I would have been gone.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.550
- Lee, why don't you
get out of here?
- Right?

41:07.620 --> 41:08.550
No, I agree with her,
Rerun.

41:08.620 --> 41:09.850
All the rockers are skinny.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.720
Now put on Gladys Knight
and the Pips.

41:29.870 --> 41:31.940
Hi. Can I help you?

41:32.010 --> 41:33.580
Katherine Boyd?

41:33.640 --> 41:35.040
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

41:35.110 --> 41:38.050
I'm looking
for Marius Josepovitch.

41:38.110 --> 41:40.720
Uh, you mean Josepovich?

41:40.780 --> 41:42.380
Oh, good. You do know him.

41:42.450 --> 41:45.250
Uh, w-who are you?

41:45.320 --> 41:47.090
I am his parole officer.

41:47.150 --> 41:50.160
And according to my paperwork,
this is his residence.

41:50.220 --> 41:51.760
Is he here?

41:54.330 --> 41:56.260
Marius, you awake?

41:58.200 --> 42:00.330
Marius, I'm Mr. Bagwell.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.800
Hi, Mr. Bagwell.

42:02.870 --> 42:04.110
Uh, I don't want
to shake your hand.

42:04.170 --> 42:04.970
Okay.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.170
I just came
to check up on you.

42:07.240 --> 42:08.610
Uh, hot, hot, hot.

42:08.610 --> 42:10.080
Ah, here you go, buddy.

42:10.140 --> 42:12.610
It's all about the white foods
when you have the trots.

42:12.610 --> 42:13.780
Yeah.

42:13.850 --> 42:15.420
Is Uncle Marius
going to be okay?

42:15.480 --> 42:17.050
I hope so, sweetie.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.620
He just had it coming
out of both ends

42:19.650 --> 42:22.290
all afternoon.
I'm Brandon, by the way.

42:25.660 --> 42:27.290
I'll see myself out.

42:32.700 --> 42:35.200
You ain't no eagle,
Josepovitch.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.720
Oh, you guys are the best.

42:54.790 --> 42:55.920
Amanda, honey.

42:55.990 --> 42:58.430
I'm going.
Bye, Uncle Marius.

42:58.490 --> 43:00.530
Bye, Amanda.
Oh, she's great.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.760
You guys are
doing such a--

43:01.830 --> 43:03.100
Shut the fuck up.

43:05.670 --> 43:07.370
We never agreed to this.

43:07.430 --> 43:08.700
I know. But Marius knows

43:08.770 --> 43:10.570
how much we are risking
by doing this,

43:10.670 --> 43:12.010
and he also knows
that nothing like this

43:12.070 --> 43:15.340
can ever ever happen again,
right, Marius?

43:15.410 --> 43:17.440
It'll never happen again.
You have my word.

43:17.510 --> 43:18.810
For what that's worth.

43:25.090 --> 43:26.690
I should have shot you
the other day.

43:26.750 --> 43:28.190
He said you were an intruder.

43:28.260 --> 43:29.420
I understand. Listen.

43:29.490 --> 43:30.860
You remember the address

43:30.930 --> 43:32.490
that Audrey gave you
on the phone this morning?

43:32.560 --> 43:33.730
Why? What about it?

43:33.800 --> 43:36.300
So if a cop shows up
here looking for me,

43:36.360 --> 43:37.900
it's best if you
give him that address.

43:37.970 --> 43:39.370
Oh, you son of a bitch.

43:39.430 --> 43:41.700
How dangerous
is this fucker?

43:41.770 --> 43:44.210
Just give him the address.

44:05.730 --> 44:07.030
Gotcha.

44:10.730 --> 44:11.730
You know what?

44:11.800 --> 44:14.740
I forgot
to ask Taylor today.

44:14.770 --> 44:17.470
What exactly did I do
to deserve that?

44:17.540 --> 44:20.040
- You really don't remember?
- No, I don't.

44:20.110 --> 44:22.380
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

44:22.440 --> 44:24.280
You locked me in the safe.

44:24.350 --> 44:25.750
The office safe?

44:25.750 --> 44:27.350
How can you not
remember this?

44:27.410 --> 44:28.580
It was sitting open,

44:28.650 --> 44:30.650
and you dared me
to get inside,

44:30.750 --> 44:32.890
and then
you shut the door.

44:35.060 --> 44:36.860
Okay, so I hate myself
a little bit.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.230
Maybe you didn't know
it was locked,

44:38.290 --> 44:41.230
and I was only in there
for a minute.

44:41.300 --> 44:43.830
But I still have
nightmares about it.

44:43.900 --> 44:45.070
Well,
if it's any consolation,

44:45.130 --> 44:47.940
I got locked in the trunk
of a car today,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.170
and it was the worst
half hour of my life.

44:51.170 --> 44:54.810
Then my work here is done.

44:55.910 --> 44:57.780
So how old were you?

44:57.850 --> 44:59.810
I was 6,
and you were 10.

44:59.880 --> 45:01.020
So there's that.

45:01.080 --> 45:02.620
Wow, you really
hold a grudge.

45:02.780 --> 45:04.850
Ha. You have no idea.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.090
You want a ride home?

45:06.150 --> 45:07.690
Not if it's in your trunk.

45:07.790 --> 45:09.220
You're no fun.

45:11.530 --> 45:12.960
Wait a minute.

45:14.300 --> 45:16.130
How did you get out?

45:16.200 --> 45:17.360
Of the safe?

45:17.430 --> 45:18.470
Yeah.

45:18.530 --> 45:21.040
Grandpa.
Grandpa let me out.

45:25.340 --> 45:27.470
Well, at least
she trusts somebody.

45:35.450 --> 45:37.680
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

45:37.820 --> 45:38.820
How are you doing?

45:38.890 --> 45:40.090
Good.

45:40.150 --> 45:42.320
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

45:43.460 --> 45:44.930
Yeah. Sure.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.540
Have a seat.

45:55.600 --> 45:56.840
Something wrong?

45:56.840 --> 46:00.340
Oh, no. no. I just,
uh, had a long day.

46:00.410 --> 46:01.410
Yeah.

46:03.210 --> 46:04.710
Wow.

46:04.850 --> 46:06.410
Dude, that's a lot of money.

46:06.480 --> 46:09.750
Probably shouldn't just leave
it lying around like that.

46:09.850 --> 46:13.190
No. Yeah, I helped Julia
the Persikof bond.

46:13.250 --> 46:15.260
She was nice enough
to give me a percentage.

46:17.660 --> 46:20.490
Uh, and I-- You know--

46:23.460 --> 46:24.570
Here.

46:25.930 --> 46:27.200
What's that for?

46:27.270 --> 46:29.040
Well, you know,
just so that,

46:29.100 --> 46:30.870
next time there's a school
trip, you won't miss it.

46:30.910 --> 46:32.340
You don't have to do that.

46:32.410 --> 46:34.680
I know I don't have to.
I want to.

46:34.740 --> 46:36.880
Here. Take it.

46:39.450 --> 46:40.480
Thanks, cuz.

46:41.620 --> 46:42.880
Yeah. All right. See you.

46:42.920 --> 46:44.750
- Whoop.
- Sorry.

46:44.890 --> 46:46.120
Good night.

46:53.490 --> 46:54.560
Yes.

47:15.420 --> 47:16.950
Have a seat.

47:17.020 --> 47:18.290
Something wrong?

47:18.350 --> 47:19.920
No. I just, uh,

47:19.950 --> 47:22.060
I just, uh,
had a long day.

47:24.490 --> 47:25.960
- Oh.
- Sorry.

47:26.030 --> 47:27.660
Sorry.
