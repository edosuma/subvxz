I think you can pin this one
on me, bro.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.172
No. It's our fault, Dad.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.549
We did this because

21:40.632 --> 21:43.510
we really don't want you
to sell the Shack.

21:43.593 --> 21:44.928
He's right, Raymundo.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.555
We know you were
doing it for us

21:46.638 --> 21:48.807
{\an1}but the truth is,
we're cool with our life

21:48.890 --> 21:50.642
just the way it is.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.562
We don't want Reg and
Otto to be shoobies.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.355
{\an1}Yeah, and look
how lame they made Tito.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.484
Sorry, Tito.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.403
That's okay, little cuz.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.948
So you don't really
want to move?

22:05.032 --> 22:07.075
{\an5}Uh-uh.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.075
No, Dad.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.369
Good! Then I can say

22:09.453 --> 22:13.081
{\an1}what I wanted to say days ago--
the Shack is not for sale.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.541
(<i> exasperated</i>
<i>stammering</i> )

22:14.624 --> 22:16.585
Oh!

22:19.004 --> 22:20.922
(<i> cheering</i> )

22:21.006 --> 22:22.591
A little island gift

22:22.674 --> 22:24.468
from me to you.

22:24.551 --> 22:27.429
Where I come from,
"aloha" also means...

22:27.512 --> 22:30.098
good-bye!

22:30.182 --> 22:32.309
(<i> cheering</i> )

22:33.977 --> 22:35.520
Well, don't just
stand there.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.397
We got to clean
this place up.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.232
We got customers!

22:39.316 --> 22:40.442
You got it, Raymundo!

22:42.736 --> 22:44.613
(<i> grunting</i> )

22:44.696 --> 22:46.281
Yeah!

22:46.365 --> 22:48.366
What's that great
smell, Tito?

22:48.450 --> 22:50.368
It's really making
me hungry.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.703
ALL:
Go, Shack!

22:51.787 --> 22:53.789
It's your birthday!
It's your birthday!

22:53.872 --> 22:57.793
