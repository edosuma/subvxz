WEBVTT

00:10.761 --> 00:12.604
So what is it?
What's wrong?

00:12.679 --> 00:15.774
I don't know. Some kind
of signal, drawing the Tardis off course.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.146
Where are we?

00:17.226 --> 00:19.274
Earth. Utah, North America.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.029
About half a mile underground.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.277
And when are we?

00:24.274 --> 00:25.446
2012.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.121
God, that's so close. I should be 26!

00:34.785 --> 00:35.957
Blimey.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.126
Like a great big museum.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.088
An alien museum.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.171
Someone's got a hobby.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.382
They must've spent a fortune on this.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.601
Chunks of meteorite. Moondust.

00:51.927 --> 00:53.975
That's the milometer
from the Roswell spaceship.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.602
That's a bit of Slitheen!

00:56.682 --> 00:58.730
That's a Slitheen's arm,
it's been stuffed!

01:00.686 --> 01:02.654
Ah, look at you!

01:13.490 --> 01:14.662
What is it?

01:15.075 --> 01:18.079
An old friend of mine. Well, enemy.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.290
The stuff of nightmares,
reduced to an exhibit.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.005
I'm getting old.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.341
Is that where the signal's coming from?

01:26.420 --> 01:29.299
Nah, it's stone-dead. The signal's alive.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.721
Something's reaching out.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.518
Calling for help.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.533
If someone's collecting aliens,
that makes you Exhibit A.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.240
Attention all personnel.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.665
Bad Wolf 7 descending,
Baa' Wolf 7 descending.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.257
On behalf of all of us, I wanna wish
you a very happy birthday, sir.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.797
And the President
called to convey his personal best wishes.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.178
The President is
10 points down, I want him replaced.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.768
I don't think that's very wise, sir.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.436
Thank you so much
for your opinion, you're fired.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.809
- Get rid of him.
- What?

02:59.888 --> 03:01.856
Wipe his memory.
Put him on the road someplace.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.601
Memphis, Minneapolis.
Somewhere beginning with

03:04.726 --> 03:07.326
So, the next President, what do you think?
Republican or Democrat?

03:07.396 --> 03:08.943
- Democrat, sir.
- For what reason?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.779
They're just so funny, sir?

03:13.568 --> 03:15.411
- What is your name?
- Goddard, sir.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.951
Diana Goddard.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.825
I like you, Diana Goddard.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.623
- So where's the English kid?
- Sir, sir!

03:23.245 --> 03:25.043
I bought 10 more artefacts
at auction, Mr van Statten.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.282
Bring 'em on. Let me see 'em.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.425
Uh, sir, with respect,
there's something more urgent.

03:28.625 --> 03:32.300
We arrested two intruders, 53 ï¬‚oors down.
We don't know how they got in.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.299
I'll tell you how they got in.
In-tru-da window!

03:34.840 --> 03:36.513
In-tru-da window, that was funny!

03:37.968 --> 03:39.220
Bring 'em in. Let's see 'em.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.725
And tell Simmons I want to visit
my little pet. Get to it.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.567
Simmons, you'd better give me good news!
Is it talking?

03:53.233 --> 03:56.077
- Not exactly talking, no.
- Then what's it doing?

03:56.153 --> 03:57.154
Screaming.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.580
Is that any good?

04:01.158 --> 04:02.455
And this is the last.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.578
Paid $800,000 for it.

04:04.911 --> 04:05.912
What does it do?

04:06.663 --> 04:08.586
Well, you see the tubes on the side?

04:08.665 --> 04:11.088
Must be to channel something,
I think maybe fuel.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.608
I really wouldn't hold it like that.

04:12.627 --> 04:15.130
- Shut it!
- Really though, that's wrong.

04:15.714 --> 04:16.930
Is it dangerous?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.384
No, it just looks silly.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.945
You just need to be...

04:33.690 --> 04:35.158
delicate.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.116
It's a musical instrument.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.044
And it's a long way from home.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.543
Here, let me.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.667
I did say delicate.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.011
It reacts to the
smallest fingerprint.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.221
It needs precision.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.563
Very good. Quite the expert.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.477
As are you.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.480
Who exactly are you?

05:11.186 --> 05:12.563
I'm the Doctor. And who are you?

05:12.687 --> 05:13.813
Like you don't know!

05:14.272 --> 05:16.650
We're hidden away with the
most valuable collection

05:16.733 --> 05:19.577
of extraterrestrial artefacts in the world,

05:19.694 --> 05:22.243
and you just stumbled in by mistake.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.332
Pretty much sums me up, yeah.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.243
Question is, how did you get in?

05:26.660 --> 05:30.790
53 floors down, with your
little cat-burglar accomplice.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.999
Quite a collector yourself,
she's rather pretty.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.586
She's gonna smack you
if you keep calling her "she."

05:35.919 --> 05:37.592
She's English, too!

05:37.796 --> 05:40.015
Hey, Little Lord Fauntleroy,
got you a girlfriend.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.475
This is Mr Henry van Statten.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.220
And who's he when he's at home?

05:44.302 --> 05:46.100
Mr an Statten owns the internet.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.852
Don't be stupid. No one owns the Internet.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.606
Let's just keep the
whole world thinking that way, right, kids?

05:52.018 --> 05:54.146
So you're just about an
expert in everything,

05:54.229 --> 05:55.276
except the things in your museum.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.200
Anything you don't understand, you lock up.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.554
And you claim greater knowledge?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.568
I don't need to make claims.
I know how good I am.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.448
And yet I captured you
right next to the Cage.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.365
What were you doing down there?

06:05.448 --> 06:06.449
You tell me.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.374
The Cage contains my one living specimen.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.954
- And what's that?
- Like you don't know.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.459
- Show me.
- You wanna see it?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.962
Blimey, you can smell the testosterone.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.378
Goddard! Inform the Cage
we're heading down.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.260
You, English, look after the girl.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.717
Go and canoodle or spoon
or whatever it is you British do.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.098
And you, Doctor with no name.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.189
Come and see my pet!

06:32.434 --> 06:34.027
We've tried everything.

06:34.352 --> 06:39.950
The creature has shielded itself, but
there's definite signs of life inside.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.985
Inside? Inside what?

06:42.068 --> 06:43.069
Welcome back, sir!

06:43.653 --> 06:46.497
I've had to take
the power down, the Metaltron is resting.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.832
Metaltron?

06:48.158 --> 06:50.160
Thought of it myself. Good, isn't it?

06:50.660 --> 06:53.129
Although I'd much prefer
to find out its real name.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.128
Here, you'd better put these on.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.670
The last guy that touched it

06:58.043 --> 06:59.260
burst into flames.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.387
I won't touch it, then.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.474
Go ahead, Doctor.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.846
Impress me.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.107
Don't open that door until we get a result.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.165
Look, I'm sorry about this.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.251
Mr van Statten might think he's
clever, but never mind him.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.799
I've come to help. I'm the Doctor.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.341
Doctor.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.434
Impossible!

07:49.427 --> 07:51.429
The Doctor?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.564
Exterminate!

07:56.893 --> 07:58.395
Exterminate!

07:58.603 --> 07:59.650
Let me out!

07:59.854 --> 08:00.901
Exterminate!

08:01.731 --> 08:03.904
- Sir, it's going to kill him!
- It's talking!

08:03.984 --> 08:06.737
You are an enemy of the Daleks.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.330
You must be destroyed!

08:15.537 --> 08:17.255
It's not working.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.256
Fantastic!

08:26.840 --> 08:28.638
Oh, fantastic!

08:30.051 --> 08:31.928
Powerless.
Look at you.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.811
The great space dustbin. How does it feel?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.392
Keep back!

08:37.475 --> 08:38.601
What for?

08:38.727 --> 08:40.274
What are you gonna do to me?

08:44.733 --> 08:46.576
If you can't kill,

08:48.528 --> 08:50.451
then what are you good for, Dalek?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.283
What's the point of you?

08:55.952 --> 08:57.625
You're nothing.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.002
What the hell are you here for?

09:00.206 --> 09:03.927
I am waiting for orders.

09:04.002 --> 09:07.256
- What does that mean?
- I am a soldier.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.717
I was bred to receive orders.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.223
Well, you're never gonna get any. Not ever.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.601
I demand orders!

09:15.680 --> 09:18.229
They're never gonna come.
Your race is dead.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.437
You all burnt. All of you.
Ten million ships on fire.

09:21.519 --> 09:25.149
The entire Dalek race
wiped out, in one second.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.487
You lie!

09:26.608 --> 09:27.700
I watched it happen.

09:27.776 --> 09:28.993
I made it happen.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.450
You destroyed us?

09:41.873 --> 09:43.500
I had no choice.

09:43.833 --> 09:48.134
And what of the Time Lords?

09:53.510 --> 09:54.762
Dead.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.097
They burnt with you.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.771
The end of the Last Great Time War.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.853
Everyone lost.

10:04.270 --> 10:08.446
And the coward survived.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.779
Oh, and I caught your little signal.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.616
"Help me." Poor little thing.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.372
But there's no one else
coming 'cause there's no one else left.

10:21.913 --> 10:27.886
I am alone in the universe.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.387
Yep.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.684
So are you.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.515
We are the same.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.400
We're not the same! I'm not...

10:44.060 --> 10:45.562
No, wait.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.235
Maybe we are.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.533
You're right! Yeah, okay!

10:51.192 --> 10:52.535
You've got a point.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.283
'Cause I know what to do.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.664
I know what should happen.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.867
I know what you deserve.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.455
Exterminate.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.968
Have pity!

11:09.043 --> 11:11.262
Why should I? You never did!

11:12.463 --> 11:13.589
Get him out!

11:14.799 --> 11:15.846
Help me!

11:17.510 --> 11:19.057
I saved your life.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.898
Now talk to me. God damn it, talk to me!

11:21.973 --> 11:23.600
You've got to destroy it!

11:24.225 --> 11:26.319
The last in the universe.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.943
And now! know your name.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.983
Dalek.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.284
Speak to me, Dale-k!

11:34.819 --> 11:38.164
I am Henry van Statten,
now recognise me!

11:42.952 --> 11:45.296
Make it talk again, Simmons.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.707
Whatever it takes.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.175
Sorry about the mess.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.848
Mr van Statten sort of lets me
do my own thing,

11:56.424 --> 11:58.552
so long as I deliver the goods.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.934
What do you think that is?

12:06.017 --> 12:07.018
Uhh.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.316
- A lump of metal?
- Yeah.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.776
Yeah, but I think...

12:10.897 --> 12:14.618
Well, I'm almost certain,
it's from the hull of a spacecraft.

12:15.485 --> 12:20.082
The thing is, it's all true, everything the
United Nations tries to keep quiet.

12:21.032 --> 12:24.002
Spacecraft, aliens, visitors to Earth.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.120
They really exist.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.504
That's amazing.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.881
I know it sounds incredible.

12:28.998 --> 12:32.628
But I honestly believe the whole
universe is just teeming with life.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.925
I'm gobsmacked, yeah.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.474
And you do what? Sit here and catalogue it?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.677
Best job in the world!

12:41.010 --> 12:43.183
Imagine if you could get out there.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.891
Travel amongst the stars
and see it for real.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.272
Yeah. I'd give anything.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.171
I don't think it's ever gonna happen.
Not in our lifetimes.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.313
Oh, you never know.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.825
What about all those people who say they've
been inside of spaceships and things,

12:55.900 --> 12:57.527
and talked to aliens?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.537
I think they're nutters.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.369
Yeah. Me, too.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.790
So how d'you end up here?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.997
Van Statten has agents all over the world,

13:09.080 --> 13:10.127
looking for geniuses to recruit.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.129
Oh, right, you're a genius.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.922
Sorry, but, yeah.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.925
I can't help it, I was born clever.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.092
When I was eight,
I logged onto the US defence system.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.059
Nearly caused World War Three.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.432
What, and that's funny, is it?

13:23.553 --> 13:26.306
You should've been there.
Just to see them running about.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.515
Fantastic!

13:29.225 --> 13:30.818
You sound like the Doctor.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.321
- Are you and him...
- No, we're just friends.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.530
Good.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.403
Why's that good?

13:36.899 --> 13:38.276
Just is.

13:41.070 --> 13:45.325
So, wouldn't you rather be downstairs?

13:45.408 --> 13:48.002
You've got these bits of metal and stuff,

13:48.411 --> 13:50.531
but Mr van Statten's got
a living creature down there.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.834
Yeah. Well, I did ask,
but he keeps it to himself.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.177
Although, if you're a genius,

13:57.253 --> 13:59.722
it doesn't take long to patch
through on the comms system.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.092
Let's have a look then!

14:04.927 --> 14:07.555
It doesn't do much, the alien.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.934
It's weird, it's kind of useless.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.271
It's just like this great big pepper pot.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.216
It's being tortured. Where's the Doctor?

14:28.117 --> 14:30.119
- I don't know.
- Take me down there. Now.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.414
The metal's just battle armour.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.045
The real Dalek creature is inside.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.685
- What does it look like?
- A nightmare.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.679
It's a mutation.
The Dalek race were genetically engineered.

14:39.754 --> 14:42.177
Every single emotion
was removed, except hate.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.430
Genetically engineered? By whom?

14:45.510 --> 14:46.807
By a genius, van Statten.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.647
By a man who was king of his own little world.
You'd like him.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.724
It's been on Earth for over 50 years.

14:51.808 --> 14:55.108
Sold at private auction,
moving from one collection to another.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.438
Why would it be a threat now?

14:56.521 --> 14:59.274
Because I'm here. How did it get to Earth?
Does anyone know?

14:59.357 --> 15:01.906
The records say it came
from the sky like a meteorite.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.078
It fell to Earth on the Ascension Islands,

15:04.153 --> 15:05.655
burnt in its crater for three days,

15:05.738 --> 15:06.910
before anybody could get near it.

15:06.989 --> 15:10.334
And all that time, it was screaming.
Must have gone insane.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.423
It must have fallen through time.
The only survivor.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.624
You talked about a war?

15:16.707 --> 15:20.428
The Time War. The final battle
between my people and the Dalek race.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.050
But you survived, too.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.798
Not by choice.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.977
This means the Dalek
isn't the only alien on Earth, Doctor.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.053
There's you.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.357
The only one of your kind in existence.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.285
Now smile!

15:49.031 --> 15:51.079
Two hearts.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.706
A binary vascular system!

15:52.869 --> 15:54.542
Oh, I am so gonna patent this.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.373
So that's your secret.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.795
You don't just collect
this stuff, you scavenge it.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.755
This technology
has been falling to Earth for centuries.

16:02.837 --> 16:06.182
All it took was the right mind
to use it properly.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.386
Oh, the advances I've made from alien junk.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.188
You have no idea, Doctor!

16:12.263 --> 16:14.061
Broadband? Roswell.

16:14.849 --> 16:18.979
Just last year, my scientists
cultivated bacteria

16:19.061 --> 16:21.780
from the Russian crater,
and do you know what we found?

16:22.398 --> 16:25.026
The cure for the common cold.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.915
Kept it strictly within the laboratory, of
course. No need to get people excited.

16:31.032 --> 16:34.878
Why sell one cure
when I can sell a thousand palliatives?

16:34.952 --> 16:37.080
D'you know what a Dalek is, van Statten?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.508
A Dalek is honest.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.928
It does what it was born to do,
for the survival of its species.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.347
That creature in your dungeon
is better than you.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.054
In that case,
I will be true to myself.

16:49.592 --> 16:50.935
And continue.

16:51.552 --> 16:55.602
Listen to me! That thing downstairs
is gonna kill every last one of us!

16:55.681 --> 16:57.354
Nothing can escape the Cage.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.319
But it's woken up!
It knows I'm here! It's gonna get out!

17:04.440 --> 17:07.990
Van Statten, I swear,
no one on this base is safe.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.445
No one on this planet!

17:13.324 --> 17:15.041
Hold it right there. Level three access.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.211
Special clearance from Mr van Statten.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.217
Don't get too close.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.436
Hello?

17:39.725 --> 17:41.227
Are you in pain?

17:41.352 --> 17:42.729
My name's Rose Tyler.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.973
I've got a friend, he can help.
He's called the Doctor.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.324
What's your name?

17:46.816 --> 17:48.033
Yes.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.319
What?

17:52.989 --> 17:55.993
I am in pain.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.666
They torture me,

18:00.997 --> 18:05.343
but still they fear me.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.304
Do you fear me?

18:10.214 --> 18:11.340
No.

18:15.428 --> 18:19.149
I am dying.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.934
No, we can help.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.941
I welcome death.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.946
But I am glad

18:30.610 --> 18:33.910
that before I die,

18:35.197 --> 18:38.167
I met a human

18:38.242 --> 18:41.621
who was not afraid.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.666
Isn't there anything I can do?

18:46.208 --> 18:48.711
My race is dead.

18:50.379 --> 18:53.883
I shall die alone.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.356
- Rose, no!

19:06.312 --> 19:11.193
Genetic material extrapolated.

19:11.275 --> 19:15.997
Initiate cellular reconstruction!

19:23.079 --> 19:24.581
What the hell have you done?

19:28.584 --> 19:31.508
What ya gonna do? Sucker me to death?

19:35.716 --> 19:36.968
It's killing him! Do something!

19:37.093 --> 19:38.253
Condition red. Condition red.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.637
I repeat, this is not a drill!

19:41.389 --> 19:43.437
Release me if you want to live.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.607
You've got to keep it in that cell!

19:47.978 --> 19:49.150
Doctor, it's all my fault.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.693
I've sealed the compartment.

19:50.773 --> 19:52.696
It can't get out.
That lock's got a billion combinations.

19:52.775 --> 19:53.776
The Dalek's a genius.

19:53.901 --> 19:57.622
It can calculate a thousand
billion combinations in one second flat.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.265
Open fire!

20:22.179 --> 20:23.726
Don't shoot it.
I want it unharmed!

20:24.140 --> 20:25.357
Rose, get out of there!

20:33.649 --> 20:36.243
De Maggie, take the civilians
and get them out alive.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.657
That is your job, got that?

20:38.112 --> 20:39.284
You! With me!

20:58.966 --> 21:00.718
Abandoning the Cage, sir!

21:01.927 --> 21:04.851
We're losing power. It's draining the base.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.147
Oh, my God.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.772
It's draining the entire
power supplies of the whole of Utah.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.694
- It's downloading.
- Downloading what?

21:11.312 --> 21:13.531
Sir! The entire West Coast has gone down!

21:13.606 --> 21:17.531
It's not just energy. That Dalek
just absorbed the entire Internet.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.112
It knows everything!

21:20.696 --> 21:25.076
The Daleks survive in me!

21:34.877 --> 21:36.345
The cameras in the vault have gone down.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.798
We've only got emergency power.
It's eaten everything else.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.224
You've got to kill it now!

21:40.299 --> 21:42.552
All guards to converge on the
Metaltron Cage immediately.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.272
Civilians! Let 'em through!

21:51.060 --> 21:52.482
Cover the north wall.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.189
Red division, maintain
suppressing fire along the perimeter.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.366
Blue division...

22:28.889 --> 22:30.232
Tell them to stop shooting at it.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.433
But it's killing them!

22:31.517 --> 22:34.361
They're dispensable, that Dalek is unique.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.986
I don't want a scratch on its bodywork!
Do you hear me?

22:39.066 --> 22:40.659
Do you hear me?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.003
That's us,
right below the surface.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.426
That's the Cage, and that's the Dalek.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.803
This museum of yours.
Have you got any alien weapons?

23:03.883 --> 23:06.477
Lots of them, but the trouble is
the Dalek's between us and them.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.077
We've got to keep that thing alive.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.105
We could just
seal the entire vault, trap it down there.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.439
Leaving everyone trapped with it?

23:11.515 --> 23:14.519
Rose is down there.
I won't let that happen, have you got that?

23:15.144 --> 23:16.904
It has to go through this area.
What's that?

23:17.062 --> 23:18.154
Weapons testing.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.983
Give guns to technicians,
the lawyers, anyone, everyone.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.410
Only then have you got a
chance of killing it.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.536
Stairs! That's more like it!

23:27.615 --> 23:28.832
Hasn't got legs, it's stuck!

23:28.908 --> 23:30.410
It's coming! Get up!

23:46.342 --> 23:48.561
Great big alien death machine.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.809
Defeated by a flight of stairs!

23:52.598 --> 23:53.645
Now listen to me.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.610
I demand that you return to your Cage.

23:56.685 --> 23:57.937
If you want to negotiate,

23:58.020 --> 24:00.523
then I can guarantee
Mr van Statten will be willing to talk.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.324
I accept that we imprisoned you,

24:02.399 --> 24:04.026
and maybe that was wrong,

24:04.151 --> 24:07.621
but people have died,
and that stops right now.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.867
The killing stops. Have you got that?

24:11.367 --> 24:13.461
I demand that you surrender. Is that clear?

24:15.037 --> 24:17.256
Elevate.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.098
Oh, my God.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.518
Adam, get her out of here.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.230
Come with us. You can't stop it.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.937
Someone's got to try. Now get out!

24:40.020 --> 24:42.114
Don't look back, just run!

24:54.910 --> 24:56.958
I thought you were the
great expert, Doctor.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.629
If you're so impressive,
then why not just reason with this Dalek?

25:01.250 --> 25:02.530
It must be willing to negotiate.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.261
There must be something it needs.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.417
Everything needs something.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.182
- What's the nearest town?
- Salt Lake City.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.508
- Population?
- One million.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.682
All dead.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.056
If the Dalek gets out,
it'll murder every living creature.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.013
- That's all it needs.
- But why would it do that?

25:14.096 --> 25:15.689
Because it honestly
believes they should die.

25:15.764 --> 25:18.517
Human beings are different,
and anything different is wrong.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.398
It's the ultimate in racial cleansing,

25:20.477 --> 25:22.775
and you, van Statten, you've let it loose.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.034
The Dalek's surrounded by a force field.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.960
The bullets are melting
before they even hit home.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.579
But it's not indestructible.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.381
If you concentrate your
fire, you might get through.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.339
Aim for the dome, the head, the eyepiece.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.639
That's the weak spot.

25:49.715 --> 25:53.219
Thank you, Doctor, but I think I know
how to fight one single tin robot.

25:56.805 --> 25:57.806
Positions!

26:06.940 --> 26:08.533
Hold your fire!

26:09.902 --> 26:11.654
You two, get the hell out of there!

26:37.596 --> 26:38.768
It was looking at me.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.224
Yeah, it wants to slaughter us!

26:40.349 --> 26:42.101
No, but it was looking right at me!

26:42.184 --> 26:46.030
So? It's just a sort of metal eye
thing, it's looking all around.

26:46.563 --> 26:47.655
I don't know. It's like,

26:47.731 --> 26:50.450
it's like there's
something inside, looking at me.

26:50.526 --> 26:53.245
Like, like it knows me.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.540
On my mark.

27:06.750 --> 27:07.842
Open fire!

27:15.384 --> 27:16.761
We've got vision!

27:21.849 --> 27:22.975
It wants us to see.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.125
Fall back! Fall back!

28:59.321 --> 29:01.039
Perhaps it's time for a new strategy.

29:01.114 --> 29:03.367
Maybe we should consider
abandoning this place.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.329
Except there's no power
to the helipad, sir.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.958
We can't get out.

29:08.038 --> 29:09.585
You said we could seal the vault?

29:09.998 --> 29:13.753
It was designed to be a bunker
in the event of nuclear war.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.132
- Steel bulkheads...
- There's not enough power!

29:15.212 --> 29:17.532
- Those bulkheads are massive.
- We've got emergency power,

29:17.547 --> 29:18.764
we can reroute that to the bulkhead door.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.183
We'd have to bypass the security codes.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.768
That would take a computer genius.

29:21.843 --> 29:22.890
Good thing you've got me, then.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.144
- You wanna help?
- I don't want to die, Doctor, simple as that.

29:26.223 --> 29:29.147
And nobody knows this software
better than me.

29:29.226 --> 29:30.352
Sir'?

29:31.311 --> 29:36.533
I shall speak only to the Doctor.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.869
You're gonna get rusty.

29:42.990 --> 29:49.088
I fed off the DNA of Rose Tyler.

29:49.204 --> 29:55.086
Extrapolating the biomass
of a time traveller

29:55.168 --> 29:57.637
regenerated me.

29:57.713 --> 29:58.885
What's your next trick?

29:59.339 --> 30:03.890
I have been searching for the Daleks.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.471
Yeah, I saw.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.557
Downloading the Internet.
What did you find?

30:08.640 --> 30:13.862
I scanned your satellites
and radio telescopes.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.230
And?

30:15.731 --> 30:17.074
Nothing.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.987
Where shall I get my orders now?

30:21.236 --> 30:23.238
You're just a soldier without commands.

30:23.572 --> 30:27.702
Then I shall follow the Primary Order.

30:27.784 --> 30:32.381
The Dalek instinct to destroy. To conquer!

30:32.456 --> 30:34.049
What for? What's the point?

30:37.586 --> 30:39.384
Don't you see? It's all gone.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.262
Everything you were,
everything you stood for.

30:44.092 --> 30:46.971
Then what should I do?

30:49.389 --> 30:50.891
All right, then.

30:51.641 --> 30:54.190
If you want orders, follow this one.

30:57.731 --> 30:58.823
Kill yourself.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.034
The Daleks must survive!

31:01.109 --> 31:02.531
The Daleks have failed!

31:02.611 --> 31:05.455
Why don't you finish the job
and make the Daleks extinct?

31:05.614 --> 31:07.241
Rid the universe of your filth!

31:07.407 --> 31:08.875
Why don't you just die?

31:11.828 --> 31:15.924
You would make a good Dalek.

31:23.090 --> 31:24.467
Seal the vaults.

31:33.809 --> 31:37.154
I can leech power off the ground
defences, feed it to the bulkheads.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.239
It's been years since I
had to work this fast!

31:39.314 --> 31:40.941
- Are you enjoying this?
- Doctor.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.025
She's still down there.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.705
This isn't the best time!

31:47.948 --> 31:50.121
- Where are you?
- Level 49.

31:50.742 --> 31:54.337
You've got to keep moving. The vault
is being sealed off up at level 46.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.922
Can't you stop them closing?

31:55.997 --> 31:57.123
I'm the one who's closing them.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.834
I can't wait, and I can't help you.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.885
Now for God's sake, run!

32:09.010 --> 32:10.762
Done it! We've got power to the bulkheads.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.473
The Dalek's right behind them.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.729
We're nearly there! Give us two seconds!

32:15.100 --> 32:16.461
Doctor, I can't sustain the power.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.111
The whole system is failing.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.866
Doctor, you've got to close the bulkheads.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.873
I'm sorry.

32:37.789 --> 32:38.961
Come on!

33:00.228 --> 33:01.400
The vault is sealed.

33:02.189 --> 33:04.783
Rose! Where are you? Rose, did you make it?

33:10.197 --> 33:11.790
Sorry. I was a bit slow.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.425
See you, then, Doctor.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.684
It wasn't your fault.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.854
Remember that, okay? It wasn't your fault.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.057
And d'you know what?

33:38.517 --> 33:41.316
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.247
Exterminate

33:58.245 --> 33:59.417
I killed her.

33:59.496 --> 34:00.588
I'm sorry.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.046
I said I'd protect her.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.670
She was only here
because of me, and you're sorry?

34:06.753 --> 34:10.632
I could have killed
that Dalek in its cell, but you stopped me.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.433
It was the prize of my collection!

34:12.509 --> 34:15.183
Your collection? Well, was it worth it?

34:15.594 --> 34:18.143
Worth all those men's deaths? Worth Rose?

34:18.848 --> 34:20.440
Let me tell you something, van Statten.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.815
Mankind goes into space to explore.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.313
To be part of something greater...

34:24.396 --> 34:27.445
Exactly! I wanted to touch the stars.

34:27.524 --> 34:30.152
You just want to drag the stars
down and stick them underground,

34:30.235 --> 34:32.533
underneath tons of sand and dirt,

34:32.654 --> 34:34.327
and label them.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.079
You're about
as far from the stars as you can get.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.791
And you took her down with you.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.010
She was 19 years old.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.064
Go on then, kill me.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.606
Why are you doing this?

35:04.686 --> 35:08.031
I am armed. I will kill.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.155
It is my purpose.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.827
They're all dead because of you!

35:12.902 --> 35:16.406
They are dead because of us!

35:20.076 --> 35:21.544
And now what?

35:21.661 --> 35:23.163
What are you waiting for?

35:23.246 --> 35:28.002
I feel your fear.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.129
What d'you expect?

35:30.211 --> 35:34.057
Daleks do not fear. Must not fear!

35:37.427 --> 35:40.306
You gave me life.

35:40.930 --> 35:45.231
What else have you given me?

35:45.310 --> 35:48.530
I am contaminated.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.993
You were quick on your feet,
leaving Rose behind.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.070
I'm not the one who sealed the vault!

35:55.195 --> 36:00.292
Open the bulkhead or Rose Tyler dies.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.166
You're alive!

36:04.245 --> 36:05.997
Can 't get rid of me.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.708
I thought you were dead.

36:07.791 --> 36:10.010
Open the bulkhead!

36:10.418 --> 36:11.510
Don '2' do it!

36:11.586 --> 36:14.556
What use are emotions,

36:14.631 --> 36:19.808
if you will not save the woman you love?

36:25.517 --> 36:27.269
I killed her once.

36:28.311 --> 36:29.608
I can't do it again.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.586
What do we do now?

36:48.665 --> 36:51.635
You bleeding heart, what the hell do we do?

36:51.710 --> 36:54.054
- Kill it when it gets here.
- All the guns are useless,

36:54.129 --> 36:55.426
and the alien weapons are in the vault.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.507
Only the catalogued ones.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.305
Broken.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.311
Broken.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.101
Hairdryer.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.271
Mr van Statten tends to
dispose of his staff

37:11.354 --> 37:12.955
and when he does, he wipes their memory.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.655
I kept this stuff in case
I needed to fight my way out one day.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.735
What, you in a fight?

37:16.818 --> 37:18.070
- I'd like to see that.
- I could do!

37:18.153 --> 37:19.746
What you gonna do,
throw your A Levels at 'em?

37:19.821 --> 37:20.993
Oh, yes!

37:23.158 --> 37:24.831
Lock and load!

37:34.586 --> 37:36.463
I'm begging you, don't kill them.
You didn't kill me.

37:36.546 --> 37:37.843
But why not?

37:39.007 --> 37:41.260
Why are you alive?

37:41.843 --> 37:43.971
My function is to kill.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.976
What am I?

37:46.055 --> 37:47.773
What am I?

37:54.564 --> 37:56.817
Don't move! Don't do anything!

37:56.941 --> 37:58.568
It's beginning to question itself.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.037
Van Statten.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.577
You tortured me.

38:04.491 --> 38:05.868
Why?

38:05.950 --> 38:09.625
I wanted to help you, I just... I
don't know, I was trying to help.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.548
I thought if we could
get through to you, if we could mend you...

38:12.624 --> 38:14.297
I wanted you better. I'm sorry.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.879
I'm so sorry. I swear, I
just wanted you to talk!

38:18.296 --> 38:20.799
Then hear me talk now.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.134
Exterminate!

38:22.217 --> 38:23.639
Exterminate!

38:23.718 --> 38:25.470
Exterminate!

38:25.553 --> 38:27.351
Don't do it! Don't kill him!

38:29.224 --> 38:31.067
You don't have to do this anymore.

38:31.142 --> 38:35.067
There must be something else,
not just killing. What else is there?

38:35.772 --> 38:36.989
What do you want?

38:43.404 --> 38:45.406
I want

38:45.490 --> 38:46.912
freedom.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.668
You're out. You made it.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.375
I never thought
I'd feel the sunlight again.

39:36.457 --> 39:41.213
How does it feel?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.750
Get out of the way!

40:23.004 --> 40:24.472
Rose, get out of the way, now!

40:24.547 --> 40:27.346
No! 'Cause I won't let you do this.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.427
That thing killed hundreds of people.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.180
It's not the one pointing the gun at me.

40:32.555 --> 40:35.024
I've got to do this. I've got to end it.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.852
The Daleks destroyed my home, my people.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.734
I've got nothing left.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.029
Look at it.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.364
What's it doing?

40:48.154 --> 40:50.122
It's the sunlight. That's all it wants.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.290
But it can't...

40:51.366 --> 40:54.586
It couldn't kill van Statten, it
couldn't kill me. It's changing.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.506
And what about you, Doctor?

40:58.998 --> 41:01.171
What the hell are you changing into?

41:06.214 --> 41:07.682
I couldn't...

41:12.095 --> 41:13.563
I wasn't...

41:19.769 --> 41:21.191
Oh, Rose.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.489
They're all dead.

41:23.564 --> 41:28.195
Why do we survive?

41:30.530 --> 41:31.656
I don't know.

41:31.739 --> 41:38.748
I am the last of the Daleks.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.541
You're not even that.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.758
Rose did more than regenerate you.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.264
You've absorbed her DNA.

41:49.090 --> 41:50.342
You're mutating.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.937
Into what?

41:55.096 --> 41:56.439
Something new.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.231
I'm sorry.

42:01.310 --> 42:03.062
Isn't that better?

42:03.938 --> 42:05.315
Not for a Dalek.

42:06.524 --> 42:10.825
I can feel

42:10.903 --> 42:15.329
so many ideas.

42:15.408 --> 42:19.788
So much darkness.

42:19.871 --> 42:23.592
Rose. Give me orders.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.968
Order me to die.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.144
I can't do that.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.229
This is not life.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.646
This is sickness.

42:42.560 --> 42:46.030
I shall not be like you!

42:46.898 --> 42:48.992
Order my destruction!

42:51.444 --> 42:52.821
Obey!

42:52.945 --> 42:54.367
Obey!

42:54.447 --> 42:55.573
Obey!

42:59.035 --> 43:00.207
Do it.

43:02.663 --> 43:08.921
Are you frightened, Rose Tyler?

43:11.798 --> 43:13.015
Yeah.

43:14.801 --> 43:17.725
So am I.

43:19.347 --> 43:22.726
Exterminate.

43:58.761 --> 43:59.887
What the hell are you doing?

44:00.012 --> 44:03.733
Two hundred personnel dead,
and all because of you, sir.

44:03.808 --> 44:07.403
Take him away, wipe his memory
and leave him by the road someplace.

44:07.478 --> 44:08.900
You can't do this to me!

44:08.980 --> 44:10.402
I am Henry van Statten!

44:10.565 --> 44:13.785
By tonight, Henry van Statten
will be a homeless, brainless junkie,

44:13.901 --> 44:17.826
living on the streets
of San Diego, Seattle, Sacramento.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.624
Some place beginning with

44:25.246 --> 44:27.374
Little piece of home. Better than nothing.

44:27.957 --> 44:30.631
Is that the end of it?
The Time War.

44:30.751 --> 44:31.923
I'm the only one left.

44:32.628 --> 44:35.051
I win. How about that?

44:36.007 --> 44:37.304
The Dalek survived.

44:37.383 --> 44:39.260
Maybe some of your people did, too.

44:39.343 --> 44:40.686
I'd know.

44:40.761 --> 44:41.887
In here.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.766
Feels like there's no one.

44:45.308 --> 44:47.936
Well, then. Good thing
I'm not going anywhere.

44:48.436 --> 44:49.483
Yeah.

44:49.604 --> 44:50.947
We'd better get out.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.821
Van Statten's disappeared.
They're closing down the base.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.868
Goddard says
they're gonna fill it full of cement,

44:55.943 --> 44:57.069
like it never existed!

44:57.153 --> 44:58.245
It's about time.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.118
I'll have to go back home.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.245
Better hurry up, then.

45:01.324 --> 45:03.543
Next flight to Heathrow
leaves at 1500 hours.

45:03.618 --> 45:06.747
Adam was saying that all his life,
he wanted to see the stars.

45:07.288 --> 45:08.961
Tell him to go and stand outside, then.

45:09.624 --> 45:12.047
He's all on his own, Doctor.
And he did help.

45:12.126 --> 45:13.469
He left you down there!

45:13.544 --> 45:14.591
So did you.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.511
What are you talking about?
We've got to leave!

45:16.797 --> 45:18.219
Plus, he's a bit pretty.

45:18.299 --> 45:19.596
I hadn't noticed.

45:21.427 --> 45:22.519
On your own head.

45:22.595 --> 45:25.690
What are you doing? She said cement.

45:25.973 --> 45:28.726
She wasn't joking, we're
gonna get sealed in!

45:30.561 --> 45:31.778
Doctor?

45:32.313 --> 45:35.157
What are you doing standing inside a box?

45:37.777 --> 45:38.949
Rose?

45:53.167 --> 45:55.545
The fourth great and
bountiful human empire.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.338
Planet Earth at its height.

45:59.590 --> 46:02.309
Kronkburger with cheese,
kronkburger with pajatos.

46:02.385 --> 46:03.728
Something's wrong.

46:04.303 --> 46:06.021
My watch must be wrong.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.269
That's what comes with showing off.

46:07.348 --> 46:08.725
Your history's not as good
as you thought it was.

46:08.849 --> 46:09.941
My history's perfect.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.269
Well, obviously not.

46:11.352 --> 46:12.820
I can taste it.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.272
Engage safety.

46:14.355 --> 46:16.323
Someone down there
shouldn't be here.

46:19.986 --> 46:21.283
Who are you?

46:21.362 --> 46:23.080
I'm the editor.

46:23.155 --> 46:24.202
What's happening?

46:24.407 --> 46:25.704
And spike.
