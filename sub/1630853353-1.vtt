03:31.518 --> 03:33.386
Stay away from me!
Stay back!
Jesus Christ!

03:33.421 --> 03:34.816
Okay. Okay, ma'am. Okay.

03:34.851 --> 03:37.753
Just calm down, okay, ma'am?
Just calm down.

03:37.788 --> 03:38.853
Where am I?

03:38.888 --> 03:40.987
I have no idea.

03:41.022 --> 03:43.957
I just woke up in this field,
and I'm looking to leave, okay?

03:43.992 --> 03:46.300
You want to take it easy
with that?

03:46.335 --> 03:49.028
Okay. I'm gonna stand up now,
all right?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.502
Don't.

03:51.670 --> 03:54.341
Listen! Listen to me.

03:55.806 --> 03:58.510
I'm unarmed, okay?

03:58.545 --> 04:02.415
And if you were
going to shoot me,
you'd have done it already.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.583
So I'm getting up, okay?

04:08.357 --> 04:09.983
I'm not gonna hurt you.

04:13.494 --> 04:14.856
I don't believe you.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.694
For Chrissakes.

04:17.729 --> 04:21.302
If I did this,
why would I give you a gun?

04:25.506 --> 04:26.538
Huh?

04:29.103 --> 04:30.509
Well, who are you then?

04:31.512 --> 04:34.381
Name's Tyler. And you?

04:35.681 --> 04:37.681
Sam.
Sam.

04:37.716 --> 04:41.883
Hi, Sam. It's nice to meet you.
Do you mind, huh?

04:41.918 --> 04:44.886
How about you just
point that somewhere else?

04:45.388 --> 04:47.328
Stay there.
Fine.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.632
Where did you get
that thing anyway?

04:54.667 --> 04:56.029
It was next to me
when I woke up.

04:56.064 --> 05:00.066
Anything else?
You got more pockets in those?

05:00.101 --> 05:01.342
Empty.

05:03.544 --> 05:05.577
Mmm. This okay?

05:06.074 --> 05:07.810
Huh? Yeah?

05:08.912 --> 05:10.109
Okay.

05:13.114 --> 05:15.422
In my pocket,
when I woke up.

05:16.117 --> 05:17.886
Matches.

05:17.921 --> 05:23.463
Everything else is gone.
My phone, my wallet.
Everything.

05:23.498 --> 05:25.927
This doesn't make any sense.
How did we get here?

05:27.128 --> 05:29.634
Like I said, I have no idea.

05:29.669 --> 05:32.373
But I don't intend on
sticking around to find out.

05:34.608 --> 05:35.805
I'm gonna go.

05:37.743 --> 05:39.611
You're free to come
with me if you want.

05:41.747 --> 05:43.615
No, I'm gonna stay here
and wait for help.

05:46.620 --> 05:48.114
You think that's a good idea?

05:48.149 --> 05:50.622
And you think trusting you
is a better one?

05:52.527 --> 05:53.559
Hmm.

05:54.760 --> 05:55.891
Fair enough.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.472
Okay.

06:12.140 --> 06:13.546
Good luck, Sam.

06:14.945 --> 06:15.977
Wait.

06:30.565 --> 06:31.894
You keep the gun.

06:33.194 --> 06:34.732
I'm gonna stay
way out front.

06:36.571 --> 06:37.735
Let's leave it at that.

07:10.099 --> 07:11.736
Hey, hey.

07:16.743 --> 07:17.940
Hello!

07:17.975 --> 07:19.744
Really? Are you crazy?

07:24.014 --> 07:25.585
Anybody there?

07:27.083 --> 07:28.489
Over here!

07:31.252 --> 07:33.186
You have no idea
who's out there.

07:34.926 --> 07:37.762
I didn't know who you were.
You seem all right.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.243
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop right there.

07:57.278 --> 08:00.015
-Take it easy.
-Who the hell are you?

08:00.050 --> 08:02.050
-We're just trying
to get out of here.
-Oh, yeah?

08:03.757 --> 08:04.888
Prove it.

08:07.992 --> 08:11.290
I woke up in this field.
I started walking.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.566
Found her.

08:13.800 --> 08:14.832
Now, here we are.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.839
She's in the same boat.
Trust me.

08:28.782 --> 08:29.880
Fine.

08:32.247 --> 08:33.312
Okay!

08:34.953 --> 08:36.117
Come on out.

08:54.775 --> 08:55.972
What the fuck?

09:00.176 --> 09:01.274
Uh...

09:06.688 --> 09:07.819
I'm Tyler.

09:08.690 --> 09:09.722
This is Sam.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.662
I'm Ryan.

09:15.697 --> 09:17.664
Hey, Ryan.
Hi.

09:18.766 --> 09:19.963
This is Ethan.

09:19.998 --> 09:21.129
That's Denise.

09:25.971 --> 09:27.608
Well, that's nice.

09:30.679 --> 09:31.744
I found it.

09:34.012 --> 09:35.308
Lucky you.

09:39.215 --> 09:40.720
What did you find?

09:42.053 --> 09:45.384
I, uh...
I just woke up with, um...

09:47.696 --> 09:48.860
matches.

09:50.061 --> 09:51.863
I got this.

09:51.898 --> 09:54.228
She's got a knife.

09:54.263 --> 09:56.901
-They gave him a compass.
-Who are they?

09:56.936 --> 09:59.739
Well, that's
the million-dollar question
now, isn't it?

09:59.774 --> 10:04.073
My guess?
It's got something
to do with this.

10:04.108 --> 10:08.176
It's a symbol.
It's on all of our items.

10:16.153 --> 10:17.350
Well, I'll be.

10:19.893 --> 10:21.024
It's on mine too.

10:22.093 --> 10:26.997
Look, we've been
staying on point
using his compass.

10:27.032 --> 10:29.868
We've gone about three klicks.
We are bound to find something.

10:32.037 --> 10:33.432
Makes sense.

10:35.172 --> 10:38.074
Can we just go? I'm thirsty.

10:45.853 --> 10:46.918
Hey.

10:47.756 --> 10:48.788
Look.

10:50.055 --> 10:51.318
Stronger as a group.

10:54.323 --> 10:55.421
We'll follow.

10:56.798 --> 10:58.699
Great. Let's go.
All right.

11:09.437 --> 11:10.843
You good with this?

11:11.345 --> 11:12.845
Like I have a choice?

12:25.414 --> 12:27.348
What was that?

12:27.383 --> 12:28.987
I don't know.

12:29.022 --> 12:30.483
Can anyone tell
where that came from?

12:30.518 --> 12:33.321
Sounds like
it came from all over.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.229
Maybe he knows.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.539
It's like a scarecrow,
right?

12:55.246 --> 12:57.180
Maybe we're just
in a farmer's field.

12:59.888 --> 13:02.823
Honestly,
you ever seen
anything like this?

13:04.222 --> 13:06.090
I can't say
that I have.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.927
When I was a kid,
my dad used to take us on--

13:07.962 --> 13:09.192
Hold on.

13:09.227 --> 13:11.161
What was that?
Shh.

13:18.203 --> 13:20.236
Where am I? Stay back.

13:20.271 --> 13:22.502
What the hell is that?

13:22.537 --> 13:25.505
It's okay.
No one is gonna hurt you.

13:25.540 --> 13:29.575
-Something tells me
you woke up in this field

13:29.610 --> 13:31.610
and you have no idea
how you got here.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.184
Just tell us
what you remember.

13:34.681 --> 13:38.122
I, um... I was...

13:38.157 --> 13:42.929
Um, I was in my flat writing--
writing yearly conditions and...

13:44.229 --> 13:46.900
Uh-- And then
that's all I remember.

13:46.935 --> 13:49.331
I must have crashed
really hard.
Writing what?

13:51.137 --> 13:54.039
Code. If blue is the sky...

13:55.471 --> 13:57.240
What did you get?

13:57.275 --> 14:01.508
What? I didn't get anything.
It's just what I do.

14:01.543 --> 14:04.511
No. What did you
wake up with?

14:05.217 --> 14:06.381
Uh--

14:07.483 --> 14:09.318
We all woke up
with something.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.894
Well,
I don't have anything.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.293
Nothing?

14:17.328 --> 14:23.266
No. I woke up,
I heard the siren,
and then I started running.

14:24.566 --> 14:26.698
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

14:26.733 --> 14:30.306
Because that makes you
the only one without an item,

14:30.341 --> 14:32.374
and I'm not buying it.
Whoa!

14:32.409 --> 14:34.574
Back off.
She said she doesn't
have anything.

14:36.413 --> 14:38.083
I don't trust her.

14:38.118 --> 14:41.350
I just-- I just want
to get out of here.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.220
Whatever.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.322
This way.
Great.

14:55.564 --> 14:58.004
He'll calm down.

14:58.039 --> 15:00.204
I'd say this is new territory
for everyone.

15:01.009 --> 15:02.206
Just stick with us.

15:04.375 --> 15:06.309
Yeah.
You okay?

15:12.779 --> 15:14.053
I know.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.251
Here.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.411
So who's your pick?

16:16.480 --> 16:18.117
My pick?

16:18.152 --> 16:19.613
Who brought us here?

16:20.215 --> 16:22.616
Obviously,
it wasn't Ethan.

16:22.651 --> 16:24.255
I don't think it was you.

16:24.790 --> 16:26.521
I know it wasn't me.

16:27.821 --> 16:31.163
The jury is still out
on you, cowboy.

16:32.793 --> 16:34.760
You think
it was one of us?

16:34.795 --> 16:36.168
You don't?

16:38.403 --> 16:40.502
Those two are comfortable enough
to fall asleep.

16:40.537 --> 16:42.372
Sure sign of guilt,
if you ask me.

16:42.407 --> 16:44.242
Guilt?

16:45.044 --> 16:48.642
-They're all exhausted.
-And we're not?

16:49.678 --> 16:51.678
Could have been
any of us.

16:53.682 --> 16:55.418
Well, I know
it wasn't me.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.557
It's getting colder.

17:05.628 --> 17:07.463
What's with the outfit
anyway?

17:08.334 --> 17:09.531
Oh.

17:10.798 --> 17:14.371
-You mean my attire?

17:17.904 --> 17:20.113
My fiancÃ© was working late,

17:20.841 --> 17:22.577
and I wanted
to surprise him.

17:23.712 --> 17:25.712
Rose petals, candles,

17:26.247 --> 17:28.352
me in bed wearing this.

17:28.915 --> 17:30.354
The whole bit.

17:32.490 --> 17:34.259
I must have fallen asleep.

17:34.294 --> 17:36.195
I'm sure
he would have loved it.

17:38.199 --> 17:39.363
You think?

17:40.465 --> 17:42.333
Absolutely.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.880
What the hell is that?

18:03.785 --> 18:05.158
Oh, my God.
What?

18:05.193 --> 18:06.225
One, two, three...

18:06.260 --> 18:07.622
What?

18:07.657 --> 18:08.722
Hey, hey.

18:11.199 --> 18:12.726
One, two, three, four...

18:12.761 --> 18:14.926
-Are you okay?
-One, two, three,
four, five, six.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.928
Hey. Let us help you,
all right?

18:16.963 --> 18:19.766
It's the same. It's the same.

18:21.374 --> 18:23.242
There's something
in the field.

18:23.277 --> 18:26.212
Come with us.
We'll find a way out.

18:26.247 --> 18:27.510
There is no way out.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.560
We need to get
the fuck out of here!

18:52.504 --> 18:53.932
Help me.

18:56.937 --> 18:58.838
-Just stay with him.
Stay with him.
-Okay.

19:14.856 --> 19:16.262
Oh, God.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.777
You're a real piece of shit.
You know that?

19:37.613 --> 19:39.978
You knocked me on my ass
and left me to die,

19:40.013 --> 19:41.848
you spineless little fuck.

19:43.852 --> 19:47.260
Denise, I'm sorry. I--

19:51.563 --> 19:55.334
Just stay still, okay?
Okay.

19:55.369 --> 19:57.501
Maybe we should--
Maybe we should just--

19:57.536 --> 19:59.338
Don't touch it.
Please don't touch it.
Okay.

19:59.373 --> 20:01.406
Don't touch it, please.
Okay. Okay, okay.

20:03.971 --> 20:06.576
Stop moving.
I think you're making it worse.

20:06.611 --> 20:07.973
It's not that.

20:11.011 --> 20:14.551
I just remembered the last time
I saw my girlfriend.

20:14.586 --> 20:17.818
We had an argument
about nothing really,

20:17.853 --> 20:19.886
and she stormed
out of the flat.

20:21.461 --> 20:23.692
And I just kept coding.

20:26.697 --> 20:30.567
And then the next thing you know
is that I wake up here.

20:30.602 --> 20:31.799
I'm so sorry.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.967
There you are.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.740
What the hell happened to her?

20:39.709 --> 20:43.074
We were running together
and we didn't see the fence.

20:45.045 --> 20:46.583
She's hurt.

20:46.618 --> 20:50.752
Well, I'm not surprised.

20:50.787 --> 20:53.689
See what you can do for her
until we find the doc, okay?

20:53.724 --> 20:54.921
Yeah.

21:21.620 --> 21:22.718
Hey, hey.

21:22.753 --> 21:24.786
You fucking left us!

21:24.821 --> 21:26.524
Hey.
No. Fuck you!

21:26.559 --> 21:28.625
Ethan. Ethan.

21:28.660 --> 21:31.958
I can't do this.
I can't. I can't.

21:31.993 --> 21:35.401
I just--
I don't want to be here.
I don't want to be here.

21:35.436 --> 21:39.669
Hey, hey, Ethan. Ethan.
It's okay. It's okay. Okay?

21:39.704 --> 21:42.375
We're going to get out of here.
Whatever that thing is,
it's gone now.

21:42.410 --> 21:44.069
We're gonna be home soon, okay?

21:44.104 --> 21:46.874
I haven't been home
since my mom died
two years ago.

21:46.909 --> 21:49.613
My dad doesn't care about me.
He just leaves me
at school to rot.

21:49.648 --> 21:50.779
Shh, shh.

21:52.750 --> 21:53.947
I miss my mom.

21:57.590 --> 21:59.458
Do you still have
that compass?

22:06.995 --> 22:11.030
Here, you see that needle?
It's going to lead us
out of here.

22:11.065 --> 22:12.405
Do you really think so?

22:12.440 --> 22:13.934
I know so.

22:15.003 --> 22:16.673
You just need to
stay strong,

22:16.708 --> 22:19.005
and we're gonna
get through this together, okay?

22:21.977 --> 22:23.416
You got this, bud.

22:24.749 --> 22:26.452
We can't do this
without you.

22:45.165 --> 22:46.505
There.

22:49.939 --> 22:51.576
Come on.

22:54.581 --> 22:56.482
It's okay.
Here come the others.

22:56.946 --> 22:58.110
Let me through.

22:58.915 --> 23:00.651
It looks pretty bad.

23:00.686 --> 23:02.587
Okay. Let me take a look.
That hurts!

23:02.622 --> 23:04.721
You need to keep it down.
We don't know where
that thing is.

23:04.756 --> 23:06.492
Hey, hey, hey. Over here.

23:06.527 --> 23:08.791
I need you to relax, okay?
Just look at me.

23:08.826 --> 23:11.860
Can you take one deep breath
for me and hold it?

23:13.160 --> 23:14.962
Now-- Now exhale slowly.

23:17.670 --> 23:20.869
You're lucky.
It's not in the lung.

23:20.904 --> 23:23.168
So, I'm all right? Huh?

23:23.203 --> 23:25.577
No! What are you doing?
Don't touch it. I'm good.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.974
I can manage.
It needs to be removed.

23:27.009 --> 23:28.206
No, no, no, I'm good.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.516
I'm good. I can manage.

23:30.551 --> 23:32.518
-Take this.
-I'm fine. Please stop.
Stop. I'm fine.

23:32.553 --> 23:34.982
-Cameron. Cameron.
-Forget the--
Don't touch me!

23:35.017 --> 23:37.490
We need to do something
about this noise. Denise?

23:37.525 --> 23:41.153
No! Don't, please.

23:41.188 --> 23:42.957
-I'm sorry.

23:42.992 --> 23:45.630
-I need you to trust me.
-No, please! Please.

23:55.906 --> 23:58.269
Hey. How's she doing?

23:58.304 --> 23:59.776
She's okay.

23:59.811 --> 24:02.141
All right. Well,
if she can't keep up,

24:03.815 --> 24:05.518
we'll help her.

24:05.553 --> 24:07.685
No one gets left behind.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.884
I like that plan.

24:10.085 --> 24:11.986
We need water.
Yeah.

24:12.021 --> 24:13.856
You couldn't be
more right.

24:14.958 --> 24:16.859
That man
from last night...

24:20.260 --> 24:23.063
he had all
the same items as us.

24:23.098 --> 24:25.230
You think there's
others out here?

24:26.200 --> 24:27.870
Definitely.

24:27.905 --> 24:29.036
What, you think?

24:30.809 --> 24:32.105
Oh, hell, who knows.

24:33.041 --> 24:36.615
This whole situation
is fucked if you ask me.

24:37.112 --> 24:38.518
It really is.

24:40.181 --> 24:41.213
Okay.

24:42.722 --> 24:44.216
Let's go wake them up.

24:54.767 --> 24:55.832
You good?

24:56.802 --> 24:59.539
I'm good. Thanks.

25:32.838 --> 25:34.937
How far have we gone?

25:34.972 --> 25:36.774
I don't know.

25:36.809 --> 25:38.974
You would think we'd have
found something by now.

25:42.210 --> 25:44.683
Anyone back home wondering
where you are?

25:48.216 --> 25:49.589
Um...

25:51.021 --> 25:52.350
Folks have passed.

25:52.385 --> 25:55.155
Uh, I used to be married.

25:56.257 --> 25:59.698
Now divorced. Um...

25:59.733 --> 26:04.670
I did get
a beautiful little girl
out of the deal, though.

26:04.705 --> 26:07.970
Pretty sure she's wondering
where I am right now.

26:10.073 --> 26:11.138
A little girl.

26:12.075 --> 26:13.239
She's seven.

26:14.242 --> 26:16.275
What's her name?

26:17.113 --> 26:19.311
Sedona Mackenzie.

26:19.346 --> 26:23.821
And she's just, well...
a wonder.

26:23.856 --> 26:25.988
Amazes me
in every single way.

26:27.761 --> 26:28.991
That's quite a name.

26:30.731 --> 26:32.192
Siddy Mac for short.

26:32.794 --> 26:34.931
That's very Texas.
Very.

26:37.298 --> 26:38.363
How about you?

26:39.839 --> 26:40.937
Just work.

26:43.744 --> 26:44.908
That sounds lonely.

26:48.045 --> 26:49.847
My mom died
when I was young.

26:49.882 --> 26:52.377
I lost my dad
earlier this year.

26:52.412 --> 26:57.921
I work 36-hour shifts,
so no time for friends
or relationships.

26:58.990 --> 27:01.254
Well, nothing that sticks.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.357
What's the last thing
you remember?

27:07.031 --> 27:09.966
Falling asleep
in the on-call room.

27:10.001 --> 27:13.266
Laid down to catch a few Z's
and next thing you know, I...

27:15.039 --> 27:16.104
What is it?

27:18.042 --> 27:20.878
Someone had to have come
in there, have access,

27:20.913 --> 27:24.343
drug me and take me
out of the hospital
without anyone noticing.

27:24.378 --> 27:26.015
Who could do that?

27:26.050 --> 27:27.280
The government.

27:29.284 --> 27:32.450
Governments have been running
these kinds of experiments
for years.

27:33.761 --> 27:35.321
You think
this whole thing's a test?

27:35.356 --> 27:37.928
I've run data collation
and analysis
for the Pentagon

27:37.963 --> 27:39.996
that only comes from
this type of activity.

27:40.031 --> 27:44.066
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
You work for the Pentagon?

27:47.236 --> 27:52.074
You're talking about
reprogramming,
selective memory erasure,

27:52.109 --> 27:54.439
chemical therapy,
micro-implants,

27:54.474 --> 27:57.409
PTSD experimental
memory treatments.

27:59.116 --> 28:01.820
-Yeah.
-What the fuck are you two
talking about?

28:03.989 --> 28:06.517
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just need to rest.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.992
No. No.
We're not stopping.

28:09.027 --> 28:10.323
I need to go
to the bathroom.

28:10.358 --> 28:12.325
And honestly, I could do
with a minute alone.

28:12.965 --> 28:14.030
Jesus Christ.

28:14.065 --> 28:15.394
Let's take five.

28:16.496 --> 28:17.902
Okay?

28:21.006 --> 28:22.907
-I'm going too.
-I'll come.

28:23.877 --> 28:25.008
I have to go too.

28:28.079 --> 28:29.474
Stay close.

28:33.821 --> 28:35.986
You good,
or you got to go?

28:36.021 --> 28:39.759
No fluids for a day and a half.
Nothing in, nothing out.

28:41.895 --> 28:44.423
Maybe there's
something in the corn.

28:47.263 --> 28:48.768
Some water, you know.

28:56.008 --> 28:57.304
It's rotten.

28:58.571 --> 28:59.812
It's all the same.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.211
What the hell was
Denise rambling about?

29:07.283 --> 29:10.790
I'm telling you,
it's all about
instinct for me.

29:12.288 --> 29:13.859
Gotta trust your gut.

29:15.291 --> 29:16.862
You all right there, chief?

29:18.866 --> 29:20.261
Something's not right.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.035
You know what I don't trust?

29:25.873 --> 29:26.938
What's that?

29:28.975 --> 29:30.073
Cameron.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.256
Motherfucker.

29:50.931 --> 29:52.095
Give me that.

29:54.099 --> 29:55.395
See? I fucking knew it.

29:55.430 --> 29:57.463
Huh?

29:57.498 --> 29:59.531
What did you expect me
to do?

30:01.139 --> 30:02.908
Settle down, bud.

30:02.943 --> 30:05.075
She deserved it!
She's hurt.

30:05.110 --> 30:06.571
She's holding out on us, man.

30:09.444 --> 30:12.412
-She had water!
-You need to calm down.

30:12.447 --> 30:14.414
She had water
the whole fucking time!

30:14.449 --> 30:16.482
What did you expect me
to do, huh?

30:16.517 --> 30:19.188
What, hand it over
'cause you said
we're a team?

30:19.223 --> 30:23.522
You think I don't know
how this goes? It's been
the same way my whole life.

30:23.557 --> 30:25.898
"Fuck her.
I'll just take her shit.

30:25.933 --> 30:28.131
-And there's nothing
she can do about it."
-Don't give me that shit.

30:28.166 --> 30:30.331
We've been trying to help you.
We've been trying
to protect you.

30:30.366 --> 30:33.136
So I'm supposed to suddenly
just trust you with my life?

30:33.171 --> 30:36.370
How do I know
you're not the one
who did this to us?

30:36.405 --> 30:39.472
Uh-huh.
Are you fucking kidding me?

30:39.507 --> 30:42.046
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I did what I had to do
to take care of myself.

30:43.643 --> 30:46.446
Look, she's scared.
What, are you on her side?

30:46.481 --> 30:51.022
It was only half full anyway.
There wasn't enough
for everyone.

30:52.289 --> 30:53.420
How much is left?

30:56.557 --> 30:58.491
No, no, don't stop now.

30:59.527 --> 31:00.559
Tell him.

31:04.697 --> 31:05.938
None.

31:07.205 --> 31:08.435
What's wrong with you?

31:16.511 --> 31:17.675
Denise.

31:33.429 --> 31:35.000
Sam?

31:36.003 --> 31:37.134
Sam?

31:42.042 --> 31:43.404
Ethan?

31:52.547 --> 31:53.744
Help!

31:53.779 --> 31:55.251
Help!
Denise! Fuck.

31:56.518 --> 31:59.420
-No, it's this way!
-Sam! Sam!

31:59.455 --> 32:01.323
Denise!
Shit.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.231
Denise!

32:10.598 --> 32:11.663
Sam!

32:34.160 --> 32:35.588
-Shit.
-Sam!

32:36.459 --> 32:37.491
Sam!

32:39.264 --> 32:40.692
Where are you guys?

32:40.727 --> 32:42.133
We're over here!

32:52.343 --> 32:55.608
-This is her fault.
-What? Why would you
even say that?

32:55.643 --> 32:57.742
Stop! We have to go
look for her.

32:57.777 --> 32:59.612
No, no, no.
Whatever that thing is,

32:59.647 --> 33:02.219
it's close
and it's coming for us next.

33:06.522 --> 33:09.292
Staying here would be
a big mistake.

33:10.427 --> 33:12.427
We need to stick together.

33:12.462 --> 33:15.100
She can't be far.
Look, I like her too.

33:15.135 --> 33:17.267
But I don't want to be here
when that thing comes back.

33:17.302 --> 33:20.105
Yeah. Ethan, let's go.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.175
Please. Come on.

33:28.412 --> 33:30.478
We can't just leave.
We can't.

33:30.513 --> 33:33.085
I don't think
we have a choice.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.253
I'm sorry.
We're better off
sticking together.

33:36.288 --> 33:38.123
I'm not so sure
about that.

33:58.673 --> 34:00.739
What's wrong
with this thing?

34:00.774 --> 34:05.150
-What? What is it?
-This thing is...

34:05.185 --> 34:07.350
I-- I don't know.
It's been pointing north.
Now it's--

34:07.385 --> 34:09.187
Are you sure
you're reading it right?
Let me see.

34:09.222 --> 34:10.287
Yes, I'm reading it right.

34:10.322 --> 34:12.124
Are you sure about that?

34:12.159 --> 34:15.259
Because you just said north,
and you've had us going south.

34:15.294 --> 34:18.262
-What?
-That's west.

34:18.297 --> 34:21.793
-We've been following
the needle.
-And that's south.

34:21.828 --> 34:23.729
What's your problem?

34:26.932 --> 34:28.371
Oh, no.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.409
That's impossible.

34:34.610 --> 34:35.642
Fuck.

34:53.695 --> 34:55.299
This--
This can't be right.

34:55.334 --> 34:56.630
Perfect.

34:56.665 --> 34:59.369
You've had us
walking around in circles.

34:59.404 --> 35:02.471
Get that fucking finger
out of my face, you idiot.

35:02.506 --> 35:04.242
-Hey, hey, hey!

35:04.277 --> 35:06.277
-You little shit.
-Hey.

35:06.807 --> 35:07.938
All right?

35:07.973 --> 35:09.610
Hey, what's this?

35:11.416 --> 35:12.448
Oh, my God.

35:14.782 --> 35:16.254
There's no handle.

35:16.289 --> 35:17.882
Watch out. Watch out.

35:26.464 --> 35:27.661
Let me try?

35:52.721 --> 35:56.690
Okay, okay. Come on. Come on.

35:56.725 --> 35:59.726
The compass
wasn't leading us south.
It was leading us here.

35:59.761 --> 36:01.431
To this faucet.

36:02.962 --> 36:05.666
You think
we're supposed to find this?

36:07.769 --> 36:08.867
I do.

36:10.035 --> 36:11.771
So what now?

36:12.873 --> 36:14.642
Ryan, can you
look at the bottle?

36:17.383 --> 36:18.844
It's a tree. So what?

36:18.879 --> 36:20.747
No, it's not just a tree.
It is the tree.

36:22.421 --> 36:23.651
I don't get it.

36:23.686 --> 36:25.884
I've seen that tree,
this morning.

36:25.919 --> 36:27.622
This morning?
Yes.

36:28.625 --> 36:30.295
What are you saying?

36:30.330 --> 36:31.791
I'm saying
I think there is
more to these items

36:31.826 --> 36:33.023
than just
their obvious functions.

36:33.058 --> 36:34.695
Because of a tree
on a bottle?

36:39.834 --> 36:42.571
Okay. This isn't a compass.

36:42.606 --> 36:45.409
It's an indicator
designed to do one thing:

36:45.444 --> 36:47.741
lead us to this faucet
and then turn it on.

36:47.776 --> 36:51.382
That's why the needle
started spinning, because
we were right on top of it.

36:52.913 --> 36:56.387
The square on
the other one's shirt
isn't in the same place.

36:56.422 --> 36:59.951
It was closer
to the middle before.
Now it's further to the right.

36:59.986 --> 37:02.591
And the tree on the bottle,
it has to be the next clue.

37:02.626 --> 37:05.363
It's a puzzle.
Yes.

37:05.398 --> 37:06.727
So what are you thinking?

37:06.762 --> 37:09.026
I think we should go
back to the tree.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.600
What? That's absurd.

37:11.635 --> 37:14.834
You want to go backwards
because of a tree on a bottle.

37:14.869 --> 37:16.440
Not just the tree,
but yes.

37:16.475 --> 37:18.343
That doesn't make any sense.

37:18.378 --> 37:20.807
We should keep going
in the same direction.

37:20.842 --> 37:22.941
South, away from here.

37:31.589 --> 37:33.050
Who thinks
we should go back?

37:33.085 --> 37:35.426
I do.

37:35.461 --> 37:37.560
Okay.

37:38.860 --> 37:41.894
-We go back.
-Oh, my days.
Are you lot serious?

37:41.929 --> 37:43.566
This doesn't
make any sense.

37:43.601 --> 37:45.865
Plus, we have no way
of finding our way back.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.835
Sure we do.
Now we know the needle
points to the faucet,

37:48.870 --> 37:50.969
we have a point of reference
using the compass.

37:51.004 --> 37:52.476
We were going south, right?

37:53.479 --> 37:55.809
This is a bad idea.

37:55.844 --> 37:58.548
All right then.
Let's keep moving.

38:00.387 --> 38:01.419
Okay.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.593
Hey, hey.
We're better as a group.

38:10.628 --> 38:12.826
We can look out
for each other.

38:15.930 --> 38:16.962
Come on.

38:30.076 --> 38:31.482
Oh, fuck.

38:46.433 --> 38:47.696
You coming or what?

38:50.701 --> 38:51.733
Yeah.

38:55.772 --> 38:56.870
Right behind you.

39:45.591 --> 39:47.690
-Shit.

39:51.597 --> 39:54.158
Are you all right?

39:54.193 --> 39:57.865
-How did-- How did you...
-Are you okay? Huh?

40:01.838 --> 40:03.475
What the hell is that?

40:05.545 --> 40:10.515
It's a trap.
Are you kidding?
Fucking traps?

40:10.550 --> 40:13.980
Someone spent a lot of time
working on these.
Why?

40:14.015 --> 40:18.688
I don't know. My guess
is to kill that thing
that's hunting us.

40:18.723 --> 40:20.690
It's going to be dark soon.

40:20.725 --> 40:23.726
And cold. All right,
another couple klicks.

40:23.761 --> 40:26.190
We're just gonna--
No, who put you
in charge? Huh?

40:26.225 --> 40:28.599
We need to turn back
and go south.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.128
Surely, you can't be
this fucking stupid.

40:34.904 --> 40:36.101
Hey!
Ryan!

40:36.136 --> 40:37.509
Hey!
Stop!

40:37.544 --> 40:39.269
Ryan! Put her down! Now!

40:39.304 --> 40:40.974
Ryan! Stop!

40:41.009 --> 40:45.077
-Ryan! Put her down! Now!
-Ryan!

40:45.112 --> 40:48.949
Ryan, put her down.
Put her down, Ryan.

40:58.026 --> 41:00.994
You're losing it, man.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

41:01.029 --> 41:03.535
-Let me help you.
Deep breath.
-Huh?

41:03.570 --> 41:06.164
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?

41:06.199 --> 41:08.606
You're okay.
Keep him away from me.

41:08.641 --> 41:10.839
Ryan.

41:10.874 --> 41:13.138
Hey, where are you going?

41:15.879 --> 41:18.308
Ryan?
Tyler? Will you help me?

41:18.343 --> 41:19.584
Okay.

41:20.851 --> 41:22.213
Be right back.

41:22.248 --> 41:24.523
Hey. Be careful.

41:33.094 --> 41:35.534
This reminds me
of Afghanistan.

41:37.098 --> 41:38.735
The sky on fire.

41:39.903 --> 41:41.298
Terribly beautiful.

41:45.271 --> 41:47.106
I lost them all, you know.

41:49.847 --> 41:51.583
Every last one of them.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.214
My entire unit...

41:58.185 --> 42:01.923
was pinned down and wiped out
all because of me.

42:04.224 --> 42:08.600
As squad leader,
I made the heading choice...

42:13.068 --> 42:16.839
and I led us
right into an ambush.

42:19.140 --> 42:21.613
They didn't stand a chance.

42:24.915 --> 42:27.586
I am so sorry, Ryan...

42:29.282 --> 42:33.350
but I need you here
right now, with us.

42:41.096 --> 42:45.230
I've got to show you something,
but you gotta--

42:45.265 --> 42:47.870
you gotta promise
not to tell the others.

42:57.244 --> 42:58.980
I was injected...

43:01.050 --> 43:02.885
with whatever's in that.

43:17.297 --> 43:19.671
Just keep an eye on me,
all right?

43:21.268 --> 43:23.070
Something is...

43:28.781 --> 43:30.407
is-- is different.

44:03.277 --> 44:04.408
Holy shit.

44:09.822 --> 44:11.789
Okay.

44:11.824 --> 44:15.089
Okay, there has to be something.
The compass led us to water.

44:15.124 --> 44:17.124
The matches lit
the fire and lantern.

44:17.159 --> 44:18.488
The canteen led us here.

44:18.523 --> 44:20.798
It has to be here somewhere.

44:20.833 --> 44:24.934
It's just a tree.
A dead fucking tree.

44:31.173 --> 44:32.205
Anything?

44:33.846 --> 44:36.044
Oh, this was
such a waste of time.

44:36.079 --> 44:40.180
Now we're that much hungrier
and the entire day is gone.

44:40.215 --> 44:43.084
-Look, you didn't have
to come with us.
-I know.

45:08.210 --> 45:10.309
Hey, can you bring
that light over here?

45:34.874 --> 45:36.170
Is that a map?

45:39.604 --> 45:41.945
That is exactly what it is.

45:42.442 --> 45:43.474
You see--

45:44.143 --> 45:47.819
You see here?
The fence line.

45:47.854 --> 45:51.988
That puts us, um,
here, I think.

45:52.023 --> 45:54.155
We need to focus
on what we know.

45:54.190 --> 45:57.994
So, look,
that would actually
put us here.

45:59.327 --> 46:02.130
You're right.
Look at this.

46:02.165 --> 46:04.363
With these grid lines,

46:04.398 --> 46:07.938
it would only make sense
if something else lined up.

46:09.205 --> 46:11.469
Something goes
on top of this.
Right.

46:11.504 --> 46:13.878
A-A-An overlay.

46:13.913 --> 46:16.078
It has to be here somewhere.

46:19.611 --> 46:20.852
Ryan.

46:22.581 --> 46:23.822
What is it?

46:25.386 --> 46:27.287
There's a shape
on top of this pole.

46:29.324 --> 46:30.488
Wait a second.

46:41.270 --> 46:43.138
Oh!

46:46.605 --> 46:49.507
-Y-You need to focus.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

46:49.542 --> 46:53.379
There, that's it!
But nothing lines up.

46:53.414 --> 46:54.446
Wait.

47:00.993 --> 47:02.289
Holy shit.

47:02.324 --> 47:04.027
Move it
a bit more to the right.

47:05.657 --> 47:07.228
Stop!

47:07.263 --> 47:09.329
No way.

47:09.364 --> 47:11.001
It's a path.
Right there.

47:11.036 --> 47:12.497
It has to be the way out.

47:12.532 --> 47:15.401
-Yeah.
-What, do you think or you know?

47:15.436 --> 47:17.535
We just have to get
the grid count
and direction right,

47:17.570 --> 47:19.911
and then follow it out.

47:19.946 --> 47:23.277
So look, if we go north
three fence lines,

47:23.312 --> 47:28.183
and then east two fence lines,
then north again to
this last grid square...

47:28.218 --> 47:32.088
That's-- That's where
the line ends, so I think
it's our way out of here.

47:34.653 --> 47:35.894
Shit.

47:36.688 --> 47:38.160
Tyler!

48:04.254 --> 48:05.924
Get up, all right?

48:06.553 --> 48:08.025
It's still out there.

48:29.279 --> 48:30.608
Do what you can for him.

48:30.643 --> 48:31.741
Where are you going?

48:31.776 --> 48:34.381
To kill that fucking thing.

48:35.186 --> 48:36.548
You okay?
Yeah.

48:36.583 --> 48:38.583
Okay, keep pressure there.
Let's go.

48:38.618 --> 48:41.223
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

48:41.258 --> 48:43.159
Come on.

48:58.638 --> 49:01.408
No, no, no, no, no. No.

49:23.828 --> 49:26.136
No, no, no.

49:27.799 --> 49:30.173
No, no, no, no, no.
Cameron.

49:32.639 --> 49:34.606
No, no, no.

49:41.846 --> 49:44.154
No, no, Ethan. No.

49:45.487 --> 49:47.322
Ethan, no. Please.

50:03.208 --> 50:06.440
I've got to take
your shirt off, okay?
Mm-hmm.

50:08.477 --> 50:12.215
Shit, Tyler.
Did you get a look at it?
No.

50:13.185 --> 50:14.778
-That bad?
-Oh, it's fine.

50:14.813 --> 50:17.781
Keep pressure here.
We have to stop the bleeding.

50:17.816 --> 50:21.686
I'm gonna tie this around now,
okay? One, two, three.

50:22.821 --> 50:24.755
We need to keep moving.

50:26.330 --> 50:29.430
What about the others?
They know to keep north.

50:29.465 --> 50:33.533
We're following
the fence lines on the map.
Now get up.

50:36.868 --> 50:39.275
Okay, let's go.

50:42.181 --> 50:45.281
Ethan, no. Please, no, no.

50:48.748 --> 50:50.484
What have you done, Cameron?

50:52.488 --> 50:54.653
I didn't see him.
I swear. I swear.

50:54.688 --> 50:56.886
I didn't. I-I didn't.

50:56.921 --> 51:00.329
He just came
out of nowhere. Please, no.
No, don't go. Don't go.

51:00.364 --> 51:02.859
Please don't leave me.
Shh...

51:04.566 --> 51:08.436
Please, Ryan,
you can't leave me!
Please, please, please.

52:01.590 --> 52:03.359
Please tell me
I'm not seeing that.

52:12.997 --> 52:15.866
These Mr. Creepys
are really starting
to freak me out.

52:18.838 --> 52:21.674
All the same,
he must be here for a reason.

52:21.709 --> 52:23.907
Yeah, to fuck with us.

52:26.549 --> 52:29.946
Okay, so these--
these are the fence lines,
which means--

52:29.981 --> 52:32.454
Oh, my God.
The shirt. The shirt.

52:32.489 --> 52:34.258
It's the pattern
from the tree.

52:34.293 --> 52:36.392
It was right in front of us
the whole time.

52:36.427 --> 52:39.329
Do you think
it's part of the map?
It's not part of. It is the map.

52:39.364 --> 52:42.794
Maybe it's the way out.
We need to get this off.

53:02.288 --> 53:03.848
See this square here?

53:03.883 --> 53:07.016
Here, this--
this is the first humanoid.

53:07.051 --> 53:10.987
And the second one,
this is where
we found the water.

53:11.022 --> 53:15.266
See? We crossed
all of these fence lines
and back from the water,

53:15.301 --> 53:16.993
which makes this one the tree.

53:17.028 --> 53:20.029
Which got us to this fence line,
the last grid on the tree map,

53:20.064 --> 53:22.504
which is where we are now.

53:22.539 --> 53:25.771
There has to be something
we're missing. We just need
to figure out what it is.

53:34.584 --> 53:35.649
Okay.

53:37.818 --> 53:39.686
What the hell
is this thing?

53:43.890 --> 53:45.362
There's something here.

53:46.332 --> 53:47.958
What is it?
I don't know.

53:47.993 --> 53:50.334
But it disappears
under the arm.

54:20.663 --> 54:22.696
That's the same
as the faucet.

54:32.243 --> 54:34.070
It's not coming back off.

54:43.114 --> 54:44.388
What is this?

54:44.423 --> 54:45.686
I'm not sure.

54:48.790 --> 54:51.362
The pattern
matches the switches.

54:51.397 --> 54:52.594
Huh?
Okay.

54:54.092 --> 54:55.795
See? They match.

54:55.830 --> 54:59.799
On, off, on, on,

54:59.834 --> 55:02.340
off, off, on.

55:29.996 --> 55:31.127
What do you think?

55:32.471 --> 55:33.866
I don't know.

55:35.639 --> 55:36.671
I don't know.

56:14.205 --> 56:15.842
What is this place?

56:48.646 --> 56:50.481
I think
we should go back.

56:50.516 --> 56:52.076
Back to where?

56:52.111 --> 56:54.243
Maybe there's
another way in.

56:56.753 --> 56:58.049
Shit.

57:08.633 --> 57:11.634
Okay. It's okay.
Let's stay calm.

57:11.669 --> 57:13.834
There's been a solution
to every puzzle.

57:14.639 --> 57:16.166
Right?
Right.

57:17.004 --> 57:18.707
We got this.

57:22.746 --> 57:24.845
Okay?

57:24.880 --> 57:26.583
Okay, let's do this.

57:44.328 --> 57:47.868
Let's just see what's
at the end of these and we'll
meet right back here. Okay?

57:47.903 --> 57:48.968
Okay.

58:02.951 --> 58:04.621
What do you see?

58:04.656 --> 58:07.855
Mine's about ten feet down,
and a left.

58:07.890 --> 58:10.858
Mine's a right.
Okay, we should stick together.

58:10.893 --> 58:13.091
Let's just go
right back to the middle
and we'll keep going.

58:15.194 --> 58:17.260
-Tyler!
-Sam!

58:17.295 --> 58:20.065
Tyler!
Sam!

58:20.100 --> 58:23.167
Okay, focus.
There's gotta be something.
There's gotta be something.

58:26.711 --> 58:28.579
Come on, come on.

58:29.076 --> 58:30.075
Oh!

58:30.880 --> 58:33.111
The symbol. Okay, okay.

58:34.114 --> 58:36.851
Sam!
Tyler. No. No. No.

58:36.886 --> 58:38.281
Tyler, I'm coming!

58:38.316 --> 58:40.151
Tyler. Tyler!

58:41.924 --> 58:43.660
Fuck. Fuck.

58:44.729 --> 58:46.223
Come on, come on.

58:47.996 --> 58:49.831
Yes.

58:53.298 --> 58:54.671
Tyler!

59:12.856 --> 59:13.888
Hey.

59:17.894 --> 59:19.223
That seriously sucked.

59:22.701 --> 59:24.030
Let me take a look here.

59:25.704 --> 59:27.671
I know, I know.

59:29.202 --> 59:31.136
You need fresh bandages.
Okay.

59:38.376 --> 59:40.013
Keep your hand here.

59:40.048 --> 59:43.016
Okay.
Not ideal, but it'll work.

59:43.051 --> 59:44.853
Okay. Okay.

59:48.727 --> 59:49.924
What is this?

59:56.262 --> 59:57.635
What is that?

59:58.231 --> 1:00:00.165
I have no idea.

1:00:03.940 --> 1:00:05.742
I think it's a map.

1:00:08.010 --> 1:00:09.042
Of what?

1:00:10.144 --> 1:00:11.275
This maze.

1:00:14.148 --> 1:00:18.018
It's like parts
are missing, though.
It doesn't make any sense.

1:00:21.892 --> 1:00:22.957
The card.

1:00:33.068 --> 1:00:34.100
This lines up.

1:00:34.905 --> 1:00:36.234
No way.

1:00:36.269 --> 1:00:40.238
The red markings.
These must be the traps.

1:00:40.273 --> 1:00:43.846
Why would you even trust this?
Why would it be here?

1:00:43.881 --> 1:00:46.310
Maybe they figure
if you make it this far?

1:00:48.985 --> 1:00:51.986
If you were alone,
that cord is the only way
to pull yourself out.

1:00:52.021 --> 1:00:53.218
If I was alone,

1:00:54.353 --> 1:00:55.385
I'd be dead.

1:00:57.191 --> 1:00:59.961
Okay. Let's do this.

1:00:59.996 --> 1:01:01.358
Yeah.

1:01:01.393 --> 1:01:02.425
All right.

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.032
I know.

1:01:06.464 --> 1:01:08.970
That's good. Okay.

1:01:40.300 --> 1:01:41.332
Okay.

1:02:33.089 --> 1:02:34.187
Hello?

1:02:38.589 --> 1:02:42.162
Is anyone there?

1:03:41.058 --> 1:03:42.321
What is this?

1:03:45.095 --> 1:03:46.556
Only one way to find out.

1:04:17.523 --> 1:04:19.655
It's some kind
of machine.

1:04:23.694 --> 1:04:27.135
Okay, guess that
would have been too easy.

1:04:28.303 --> 1:04:29.533
There's always an answer.

1:04:32.208 --> 1:04:33.438
The bullet.

1:04:43.681 --> 1:04:45.252
It's on.

1:04:47.157 --> 1:04:50.994
It's another card.
It's the same thing,
a switch pattern.

1:04:51.458 --> 1:04:52.490
Okay.

1:04:57.695 --> 1:05:00.267
-This has to work.

1:05:02.304 --> 1:05:05.008
What are we missing?

1:05:08.376 --> 1:05:09.606
Try the lever.

1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:16.283
Okay.

1:05:18.419 --> 1:05:20.320
Fuck.

1:05:20.355 --> 1:05:23.158
Other side.
Maybe they work together.

1:05:25.228 --> 1:05:28.526
-Oh...
-You need to take a break.

1:05:28.561 --> 1:05:32.398
Yeah, not a problem.

1:05:38.472 --> 1:05:40.307
There's a slot, right?

1:05:41.739 --> 1:05:44.212
-How did you know?
-Knife.

1:05:46.150 --> 1:05:49.679
It's the only thing
we haven't used
and don't have.

1:05:50.451 --> 1:05:52.418
So that's it?

1:05:52.453 --> 1:05:55.553
We tried.
It was a good effort.

1:05:57.524 --> 1:05:59.755
No. No, we have to go back.

1:05:59.790 --> 1:06:01.196
Go back?

1:06:02.166 --> 1:06:04.265
Where?

1:06:04.300 --> 1:06:07.763
I can't remember the last time
I'd seen the knife. Can you?

1:06:07.798 --> 1:06:09.237
Well, then
we're gonna find it.

1:06:09.272 --> 1:06:11.602
I've got nothing left
in the tank.

1:06:14.211 --> 1:06:16.673
I'll be back. I promise.

1:06:18.182 --> 1:06:19.412
I know you will.

1:07:12.467 --> 1:07:13.499
Okay.

1:08:09.227 --> 1:08:11.161
There they are.
There they are.

1:08:42.986 --> 1:08:44.557
No sound.

1:08:45.395 --> 1:08:46.823
Do you understand?

1:08:54.503 --> 1:08:55.733
What happened to you?

1:08:58.342 --> 1:08:59.473
Where are the others?

1:08:59.508 --> 1:09:00.606
Shh!

1:09:23.499 --> 1:09:25.202
I'm sorry.

1:09:26.436 --> 1:09:29.305
I'm sorry. You just--

1:09:29.868 --> 1:09:31.538
You have to be quiet.

1:09:34.444 --> 1:09:35.674
It's coming.

1:10:07.939 --> 1:10:10.313
You have to stay away from me.

1:10:16.354 --> 1:10:17.683
I need your help.

1:10:27.992 --> 1:10:30.498
The knife. Fuck it.

1:10:59.793 --> 1:11:01.331
Oh, my God.

1:11:25.390 --> 1:11:27.357
Help me. Please.
It's okay. I'm here.

1:11:27.392 --> 1:11:28.952
I don't want to die.
Shh! Shh!

1:11:28.987 --> 1:11:31.592
Please, I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1:11:31.627 --> 1:11:34.122
It's okay, I'm here. I'm here.
But you have to be quiet. Okay?

1:11:34.157 --> 1:11:35.629
You have to be quiet, okay?

1:11:35.664 --> 1:11:37.059
Don't leave me.
I won't.

1:11:46.136 --> 1:11:48.444
Oh, my God. You're human.

1:12:01.492 --> 1:12:02.953
Get the fuck outta here.

1:12:05.122 --> 1:12:07.760
You and I have
some unfinished business.

1:13:08.757 --> 1:13:12.561
Die, motherfucker!

1:13:23.035 --> 1:13:25.673
How the hell did you
last out here for so long?

1:13:50.799 --> 1:13:52.469
It's time to die.

1:14:32.643 --> 1:14:34.973
Tyler,
I've got the knife.

1:14:35.008 --> 1:14:38.647
Tyler? Tyler, wake up. Wake up.
We're getting out of here.

1:14:38.682 --> 1:14:39.714
Okay?

1:14:40.816 --> 1:14:41.848
Come on.

1:14:46.283 --> 1:14:48.558
Stay with me.
We're almost there.

1:14:55.699 --> 1:14:57.831
On three. Ready?

1:14:58.603 --> 1:14:59.899
I'm ready.

1:15:01.100 --> 1:15:03.903
One, two, three.

1:15:20.823 --> 1:15:24.088
No. No. No.

1:15:24.827 --> 1:15:25.925
No.

1:15:27.357 --> 1:15:29.027
No, no!

1:15:29.062 --> 1:15:30.567
No!

1:15:32.362 --> 1:15:33.603
No.

1:15:36.069 --> 1:15:37.739
They're fucking with us.

1:15:38.940 --> 1:15:40.709
It's just a game to them.

1:15:42.108 --> 1:15:44.240
I'm done
playing their game.

1:15:51.315 --> 1:15:52.347
Okay.

1:15:55.253 --> 1:15:56.593
Okay.

1:16:08.706 --> 1:16:09.738
Matches.

1:16:16.076 --> 1:16:18.846
I don't think this
is part of the puzzle.

1:16:19.783 --> 1:16:21.145
Fuck the puzzle.

1:17:20.008 --> 1:17:21.337
You beat 'em, you know.

1:17:32.053 --> 1:17:35.417
Just give me a minute to rest
and then we'll get out of here.

1:17:37.091 --> 1:17:40.026
You're going to make it
through this, Tyler.

1:17:40.061 --> 1:17:42.424
We're going to make it
through this together.

1:17:42.459 --> 1:17:43.931
Both of us.

1:17:44.633 --> 1:17:46.769
Think about
your little girl.

1:17:46.804 --> 1:17:49.002
She needs you.
She needs her--

1:18:24.842 --> 1:18:31.242
We... can... get... out.

1:18:31.277 --> 1:18:34.080
There is no way out.

1:19:49.421 --> 1:19:51.355
<i>Evac, transport, action one.</i>

1:19:51.390 --> 1:19:53.225
<i>Medical team,</i>
<i>prep for arrival...</i>

1:19:54.899 --> 1:19:56.327
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

1:19:56.362 --> 1:19:58.197
<i>Retrieve subjects</i>
<i>for phase two.</i>

1:19:59.596 --> 1:20:04.940
<i>Primary is priority.</i>
<i>Repeat, primary is priority.</i>

1:20:04.975 --> 1:20:07.107
<i>Green, green.</i>

1:20:07.142 --> 1:20:10.638
<i>Phase two, green.</i>
<i>Operation completion, green.</i>

1:20:10.673 --> 1:20:13.916
<i>Zone four active,</i>
<i>roger, confirmed.</i>

1:20:13.951 --> 1:20:16.314
<i>All subjects</i>
<i>are priority alpha.</i>

1:22:29.416 --> 1:22:32.483
One-- One--
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

1:22:34.223 --> 1:22:37.356
Same again, same again,
same again, same again, same...

1:22:38.524 --> 1:22:40.194
This whole thing...

1:22:43.661 --> 1:22:44.726
There is no way--

1:22:55.541 --> 1:22:57.145
Stop.
