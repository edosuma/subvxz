You need to go see Dad.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.395

00:29.655 --> 00:30.695
I'll do whatever you want.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.449
We all internalize pain from.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.950
It needs to be processed.

00:34.994 --> 00:37.494
Otherwise, we're at the mercyof.

00:37.538 --> 00:41.999
Lourdes! Hi!

00:42.043 --> 00:43.834

You feel bad about lyingto the?

00:44.962 --> 00:47.046
Why should I? We're not hurting.

00:53.179 --> 00:55.012
You said your tattoohad someth.

00:55.056 --> 00:58.640

01:17.745 --> 01:21.163
You're really gonna pay this a?

01:21.207 --> 01:22.915
We got no choices, unless Byrd.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.084
- I got his location.
- Sleep's?

01:25.127 --> 01:25.876
On it..

Let's talk.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.638
Hand it over.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.765
What the hell's going on?

03:44.808 --> 03:47.017
Give me the fucking phone now!

03:57.488 --> 03:59.529
How'd you get it?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.531
It was in your trunk.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.991
I found it when
I got my backpack.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.190
What the hell
did you do to Sleep?

04:14.463 --> 04:15.504
Look, I coulda...

04:15.547 --> 04:16.747
I coulda taken it to Neckbone.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.759
Told him where I got it,
but I didn't, because of you.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.029
Alright? I didn't tell Winters.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.179
But blackmailing us? To you, th?

04:24.223 --> 04:28.141
Look, it was Hammond I was lev?

04:28.185 --> 04:29.726
Any money I got out of him wa.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.313
Start fresh after my divorce.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.023
(Look, just screw it, man. Do wh)

04:39.655 --> 04:41.363
The others are on their way.

04:41.407 --> 04:44.032
If y.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.204
Go.

05:04.263 --> 05:07.597
Yeah?

05:07.641 --> 05:08.681
Okay, I get it, but how d?

05:09.059 --> 05:10.392
If you think you could've done,

05:10.436 --> 05:14.104
why don't you get your assto th?

05:14.148 --> 05:15.480
I've seen you in pursuit. Yo.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.025
Ever.-I told you.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.986
I stopped to get the phonewhen.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.654
And it's not likel can call Air.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.698
What'd he look like? Fat? Skin?

05:24.742 --> 05:26.616
- Tinted windows.
- The car?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.118
Black Pontiac. No plates.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.870
Yeah, but why'd he justtoss it?

05:29.913 --> 05:31.193
It doesn't make sense.-I don't.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.249
What is withthe third degree?

05:34.293 --> 05:37.961
If it weren't for me, you would.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.065
Let's just focus onwhat's in f.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.715
'Cause right now, this guy's onln

05:41.759 --> 05:42.959
is to sell us out to Neckbone.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.801
No phone, no proof.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.511
Why would Neckbone believe hi?

05:46.555 --> 05:47.220
Because Neckbonedoesn't need p!

05:47.264 --> 05:48.764
He just needs a reason!

05:48.807 --> 05:51.308
Yeah, we gotta find this guy...

05:51.352 --> 05:52.352
and take him out.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.494
What are you doing?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.704
Packing your shit.

06:12.748 --> 06:13.997
I had to lie for you, asshole.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.378
I'm sorry.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.798
You are.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.110
- What you did was stupid.
- Yeah.

06:24.134 --> 06:27.010
And what I didwas even stupider

06:27.054 --> 06:28.198
covering up for your ass, but I,

06:28.222 --> 06:29.679
you say one wordabout that phon,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.014
and I will kill you myself.

06:42.611 --> 06:43.985
What happened to Sleep?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.659
He was deadwhen we found him.

06:50.702 --> 06:51.993
It looked like an accident.

07:02.548 --> 07:03.548
We didn't kill him.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.007
So, where's the body?

07:12.266 --> 07:13.223
Why?

07:13.267 --> 07:15.892
If his cell was in your trunk,

07:15.936 --> 07:17.136
the body was probably in ther.

07:19.857 --> 07:20.605
Look, I'm just tryingto make sue

07:20.649 --> 07:21.689
nothing blows back on you.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.307
Save the concernedboyfriend bu.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.989
Of course.

07:35.747 --> 07:36.997
So, where do we go from here?

07:41.336 --> 07:43.003
Nowhere.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.006
Karen...

07:47.676 --> 07:48.925
Whatever we had, it died

07:48.969 --> 07:50.249
the second thatyou stole that p.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.998
What the hell is this about?

09:05.295 --> 09:06.615
(What? Are youa couch surfer no)

09:07.089 --> 09:07.963
It's pretty comfortable.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.206
Really not as bad as it looks.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.512
Looks pretty bad.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.473
What's the story, man?

09:18.517 --> 09:19.517
What do you mean?

09:21.937 --> 09:22.769
Why'd you get kicked out of th?

09:22.813 --> 09:26.856
You know how it is.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.086
I just talked some shitabout he.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.390
You know how sensitiveshe is ab.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.311
There's somethingmore to it th.

09:36.660 --> 09:40.161
Look, if it is, it's my problem.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.516
Listen, I've seen youand your.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.707
But never this bad.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.334
What's that supposed to mean?

09:46.378 --> 09:48.086
It means, if you want to talk.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.966
I appreciate it, man.

09:53.010 --> 09:56.636
Anyways, what do you think abou?

09:56.680 --> 09:57.720
You believe Beach's story?

09:59.391 --> 10:01.182
You don't?

10:01.226 --> 10:03.018
I think she's holding someth.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.980
Yeah, I kinda gotthe same feel.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.986
See you tomorrow.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.452
What do we got?

11:03.372 --> 11:05.538
Four dead.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.915
The neighbor says WMD

11:06.958 --> 11:08.238
was being slungout of the back.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.795
You know who's good for it?

11:11.838 --> 11:14.673
I hear Neckbonehandled it hims.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.800
Homicide getting a warrant?

11:16.843 --> 11:19.803
They were starting to...

11:19.846 --> 11:21.126
but Winters already squashed it.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.979
Are those kids?

11:34.444 --> 11:35.985
Seven and nine.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.448
That son of a bitch.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.992
That's out of bounds, even fo.

11:54.923 --> 11:57.716
The media is all over th.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.884
A family of four gunned down.

11:59.928 --> 12:00.947
Do you have any idea how mucht

12:00.971 --> 12:02.211
that brings down on me from DC?

12:04.850 --> 12:06.850
The suspect isa secondary target

12:06.893 --> 12:09.018
in your cop gangoperation, righ?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.478
Yes, sir. Goes by the moniker "".

12:10.522 --> 12:11.604
Neckbone.

12:11.648 --> 12:12.939
Why kill a family?

12:12.983 --> 12:17.152
Was it about territory, or somet?

12:17.195 --> 12:18.987
I think Byrd could speak to th.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.615
It's about turf.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.117
The WMD's cuttinginto his profi.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.619
Why are we worried about it? It'.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.246
The drug is a local problem s.

12:28.290 --> 12:32.667
The suits in Washington want i.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.211
Making it a federal issue.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.839
And if we can't do that, they w.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.467
I get it. It could make us look.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.885
There is no "us."

12:43.638 --> 12:44.638
It'll make me look bad.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.176
What are we supposed to do?

12:48.894 --> 12:49.954
None of the cop gangsare involvd

12:49.978 --> 12:51.603
in the distribution of the WMD.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.189
Then widen your focus.

12:54.232 --> 12:58.067
Use the cop gangs to help get.

12:58.111 --> 13:02.071
Analysis says the drugis pharma.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.699
Meaning it was manufacturedin a.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.159
Don't worry, we'll handle it.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.994
I will follow up on thepharmace.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.414
You focus on the dealers.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.999
Thank you, sir.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.135
What's with that look?

13:24.179 --> 13:25.637
We started this witha clear ob.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.949
Now the linesare getting blurre.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.891
You're acting like thisis an o.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.078
What we have here is acareerde.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.311
So the RICO case goes on the b?

13:33.355 --> 13:34.938
For now.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.773
You use the Ravensto find the s.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.137
Once you do, we're back on track.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.122
That's bullshit, and you know i.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.041
What do you want me to do?-App!

13:57.504 --> 13:59.712
What's going on?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.036
A family was gunned down by N.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.083
Yeah, I already know about it.

14:06.721 --> 14:07.907
You know, they died because.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.390
Us? I already told you, that!

14:10.433 --> 14:12.016
She's right.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.061
Byrd, if you hadn't forcedyours,

14:15.105 --> 14:16.123
Sleep would still be here.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.981
This guy's movingthe goal post.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.275
What's he talking about?

14:23.530 --> 14:26.155
Tell him!

14:26.199 --> 14:27.824
The bureau wants us to focuson.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.068
That's the priority from now.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.495
Forget it.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.038
Wasn't part of the deal.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.402
Look, I don't like itany more.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.585
But that's what they want...

14:38.628 --> 14:40.003
so that's what we'll do.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.009
Byrd?

14:47.512 --> 14:49.012
You feeling okay?

14:51.558 --> 14:52.558
Am I feeling okay?

14:53.018 --> 14:55.018
Are you kidding me?

15:04.279 --> 15:05.236
He's losing his shit.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.156
I hope the asshole eats his g.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.343
If something happens to him,

15:09.367 --> 15:10.992
they'll shut the RICO downand r.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.245
So what are wegonna do now?

15:14.289 --> 15:15.830
What he asked.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.249
Focus on the WMDand hope that N.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.169
Yeah...

15:21.212 --> 15:22.492
but in the meantime, Neckbone's.

15:25.675 --> 15:29.052
Let's go pay him a visit.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.822
You got news about my brother?

15:49.866 --> 15:51.146
Something we need to talk abo.

15:51.368 --> 15:52.368
About what?

15:53.787 --> 15:55.912
- The kids you killed.
- Shh.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.581
You ever hear this song?

16:01.586 --> 16:03.002
Listen to the lyrics.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.047
It's where I'm at; How I'm feel.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.049
We didn't come here to talk ab.

16:09.928 --> 16:12.178
Homicide wantsto put a case on.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.324
If that happens, there'snothing.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.889
Let 'em.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.432
I got good lawyers.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.892
Why kill kids?!

16:17.936 --> 16:19.216
What'd they have to dowith anyt?

16:21.481 --> 16:22.271
You kill a man...

16:22.315 --> 16:24.357
it's over.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.401
His pain ends.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.487
You kill his child?

16:29.531 --> 16:31.280
His pain never ends.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.991
That's bullshit, Neck.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.234
Family's out of bounds, and y.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.204
Until y'all find my brother,.

16:38.248 --> 16:41.666
You don't even know if the WMD.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.543
So why don't you step back?

16:43.586 --> 16:46.462
Let us get some answers for you?

16:46.506 --> 16:50.133
Alright, Hammond.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.456
I'm gonna assume this is youloo.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.430
So I'm gonna take a breather.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.473
Clock's ticking.

16:59.978 --> 17:03.187
What's this?-Name and addresste

17:03.231 --> 17:04.021

And I'll shootyour little girl,

17:10.739 --> 17:12.238

17:37.891 --> 17:38.681
When's the last timeyou saw he?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.016

Stay here, ma'am.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.981

Victor said there was a probl.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.979
What did he tell you?

20:33.441 --> 20:34.441
Does it matter?

20:38.071 --> 20:39.340
Can we agree thatthe safety of y

20:39.364 --> 20:40.988

21:11.604 --> 21:12.979
Are you alright?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm...

You're back in theProtective Cue

22:47.408 --> 22:48.408
Get out, man.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.627
You were right.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.670
We should've come sooner.

23:02.215 --> 23:05.049
And some of thedecisions I've m.

23:09.222 --> 23:12.932

23:20.691 --> 23:21.982
You took care of business.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.986
I shouldn't have doubted you.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.257
We've got you.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.008
Alright?

24:15.413 --> 24:17.621
Shit.

24:17.665 --> 24:18.998
Maybe they bailed already.

24:25.339 --> 24:26.339
You okay?

24:27.383 --> 24:30.217
Yeah. Why?

24:30.261 --> 24:33.053
It just seems like your head's.

24:35.975 --> 24:36.891
Look, anything you want to talk?

24:36.934 --> 24:39.727
With you? No.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.020
Seriously, what's eating you?

24:42.482 --> 24:44.064
Nothing you cangive me advice o.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.997
Cargo van. Looks promisi.

25:07.381 --> 25:08.672
Got the tag.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.007
We have to go check it out.

25:28.903 --> 25:29.443
Think we found their con.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.986
Yeah, I think so.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.347
We're gonna have to make som.

25:38.371 --> 25:41.830
Nah, the choiceain't tha.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.707
If Neckbone finds outabout Slee,

25:43.751 --> 25:45.000
he's coming for our families.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.002
No, we need answersbefore we d.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.424
Once we seehow much damage was,

25:52.468 --> 25:53.468
we'll handle it.

25:56.264 --> 26:00.182
Well, I'm gonna tell you this.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.642
If killing them keepsmy family,

26:01.686 --> 26:02.977
I'm willing to go there.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.379
It's a lab.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.589
Makes sense.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.007
Shit's pharmaceutical grade.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.011
Shit.

26:41.559 --> 26:43.350
You got the address?

26:43.394 --> 26:45.019
Yeah, why?

26:50.818 --> 26:52.087
Gotta head backto the station.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.570
Steve needs me for something.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.988
For what?-Didn't say.

27:00.328 --> 27:02.703
How's a medical lab slinginge

27:02.747 --> 27:04.371
stay off the radar this long?

27:04.415 --> 27:06.373
That's the FBI's problem now.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.000
It's not ours.

27:48.709 --> 27:51.251
Shit. We picked up a tail.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.504
Where?

27:53.547 --> 27:55.005
Look, Town Car. Two back.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.009
Son of a bitch.

28:00.596 --> 28:03.138
Those Neckbone's guys?

28:03.182 --> 28:05.474
The driver's white, so unless h,

28:05.518 --> 28:06.518
I don't think so.

28:11.732 --> 28:12.981
- He's coming with us.
- Yeah.

29:09.707 --> 29:10.998
Who are you?

29:13.669 --> 29:14.709
What the hell do you want?

29:23.679 --> 29:24.759
Why are you following us?

29:27.516 --> 29:29.016
Vasily Andropov.

29:34.648 --> 29:37.149
Why are you following us?

29:37.193 --> 29:41.069
A friend had his business int.

29:41.113 --> 29:44.114
As a result, a numberof people.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.866
I'm here to make surethat doesn.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.994
What kind of businessdoes your?

29:49.038 --> 29:50.038
- He sells comfort.
- Wh?

29:52.792 --> 29:54.072
What's that got to do with us?

29:55.795 --> 29:56.955
What's thatgot to do with us?

29:58.214 --> 30:00.672
You know Kilvinsky?

30:00.716 --> 30:04.051
What about him?

30:04.094 --> 30:05.374
He says you are reason for in.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.890
Why would he say that?

30:09.934 --> 30:11.254
Because you warned hima few mis

30:11.936 --> 30:13.216
before arrestswere made, that's.

30:13.395 --> 30:14.978
He's lying.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.307
Check my call historythe day of.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.989
I haven't spokento Kilvinsky in.

30:29.537 --> 30:30.537
You're being played.

30:32.623 --> 30:33.997
I said you warned him.

30:35.084 --> 30:38.085
I said nothingabout a phone.

30:38.128 --> 30:42.756
See, Kilvinsky isn't someonel.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.080
So why else would I talk to him?

30:47.346 --> 30:48.346
I'll ask him.

30:49.682 --> 30:51.431
Maybe check his phone too.

30:51.475 --> 30:52.850
Do that.

30:52.893 --> 30:55.519
And just sothere's no confusion,

30:55.563 --> 30:56.979
if I see you again, I'll kill.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.983
You see me again, you'll probabl.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.017
Your blood pressure's abnorm.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.250
Is there a history of hypertens?

31:18.294 --> 31:20.085
No, no.

31:20.129 --> 31:21.670
I slam a lot of energy shots.

31:21.714 --> 31:22.921
That's gonna have to stop.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.192
I'd also like to run some labs.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.217
Take a look at yourcortisol and.

31:27.261 --> 31:30.095
Why?

31:30.139 --> 31:31.889
To see if the dizziness was s.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.016
Any big changesin your life lat?

31:36.520 --> 31:39.980
Yeah, you can say that.

31:40.024 --> 31:41.607
Stress is linkedto dozens of c.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.233
Heart disease, cancer, suicide.

31:43.277 --> 31:44.818
(Don't they have medsfor this k)

31:46.196 --> 31:48.071
They treat the symptom,.

31:52.828 --> 31:56.079
Let's treat the symptomfor now.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.363
This problem's not going away.

32:07.968 --> 32:09.248
This works a lot better if yo.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.352
You think I shouldget a dog?

32:18.395 --> 32:21.021
Why a dog?

32:21.065 --> 32:22.814
I figure one of those would bel

32:22.858 --> 32:24.178
than most of the people in my li.

32:26.737 --> 32:27.569
This is about your boyfriend.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.987
He is not my boyfriend.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.107
He's just some guy I was seein.

32:36.664 --> 32:37.913
So you see dogs as simple,

32:37.957 --> 32:41.583
because they're loyaland don't?

32:41.627 --> 32:42.627
They don't betray you.

32:44.505 --> 32:45.505
He betrayed you?

32:49.718 --> 32:51.009
Let's talk about my mother.

32:54.348 --> 32:55.722
You feel she betrayed you.

32:55.766 --> 32:58.141
What else would you call it?

32:58.185 --> 33:00.686
She had her own issuesthat she,

33:00.729 --> 33:01.979
so they rolled down on you.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.183
Are you gonna let them ruin y?

33:07.903 --> 33:09.653
I kind of already have, have?

33:09.697 --> 33:10.988
I mean, that's why I'm here.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.497
I want you to make a list

33:20.541 --> 33:22.082
of everything that you can reme.

33:22.126 --> 33:26.044
All the things,

33:26.088 --> 33:27.045
or fearful,

33:27.089 --> 33:28.630
that you couldn't do anythingt

33:28.674 --> 33:30.007
because you were a child.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.346
And then?

33:37.766 --> 33:39.016
We'll process them together.

33:41.103 --> 33:42.894
And when you're ready, when you',

33:42.938 --> 33:45.522
you'll talk to your mother caly

33:45.566 --> 33:46.481
and nonjudgmentally.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.151
Never gonna happen.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.986
So you can see thatshe's fight.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.276
People like thatshouldn't have.

34:03.959 --> 34:06.001
Unfortunately, lifedoesn't wor.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.509
Just make the list.

34:14.553 --> 34:15.553
We'll go from there.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.027
Hammond thinks the WMDis comin.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.697
Well, that's easyenough to fin.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.617
We can have an entry team dro.

34:38.659 --> 34:39.993
There's somethingwe need to tal.

34:40.036 --> 34:43.955
What?-The agent who did thehand

34:43.998 --> 34:46.541
has been chargedwith falsifying.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.751
It's early days still,

34:47.795 --> 34:49.022
but the SAC is tryingto do damal

34:49.045 --> 34:52.130
behind the scenes withthe US At.

34:52.174 --> 34:53.090
What kind of damage control?

34:53.132 --> 34:56.051
Cases are beingquietly dismiss,

34:56.094 --> 34:57.375
so it doesn't affectthe image o.

34:59.932 --> 35:01.252
So how do you want meto handle?

35:02.559 --> 35:03.642
Keep an eye on him.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.018
If he incriminates himself,

35:05.062 --> 35:06.978
we'll bring him into the RICO.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.314
From what I hear, there's no.

35:09.358 --> 35:10.982
We'll see.

35:29.753 --> 35:31.878
So, what's this about, Pete?

35:31.922 --> 35:33.242
Tito. Parked in front of my ho.

35:34.091 --> 35:36.341
And you thinkl told him to do?

35:36.385 --> 35:37.385
Yeah, I do.

35:39.847 --> 35:42.222
Well, Tito's a verycapable man.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.974
Always has been.

35:44.685 --> 35:45.976
If there's a problem,

35:46.019 --> 35:49.020
he can take better careof your.

35:52.276 --> 35:54.526
Look...

35:54.570 --> 35:55.944
just keep himout of my sight.

35:55.988 --> 35:58.613
I don't want him being seen by.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.991
Okay. So you're good with it?

36:03.662 --> 36:04.619
Their safety comes first.

36:04.663 --> 36:05.954
If that were true,

36:05.998 --> 36:08.790
you wouldn't bein this position?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.114
Who the hellare you to judge?!

36:13.630 --> 36:16.464
You think you know me.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.134
But if something happensto my d,

36:19.178 --> 36:21.553
you'll see a side of me you nev.

36:21.597 --> 36:23.180
Nothing will happen!

36:23.223 --> 36:25.599
I know it won't...

36:25.642 --> 36:27.017
because I won't let it.

36:44.870 --> 36:45.827
Team Bravo's in position.

36:51.919 --> 36:54.169

If we're going to do this, we.

36:57.591 --> 36:59.132
Anything on the lease?

36:59.176 --> 37:03.803
No, it's undera shell corporat.

37:03.847 --> 37:06.139
Tell the teamto prep for entry.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.266
Team Bravo, get ready.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.310

Come on.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.979
We're ready, ma'am.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.609
Do it.

37:17.653 --> 37:20.320
You're cleared for entry.

37:20.364 --> 37:21.364
Go, go, go!

37:36.964 --> 37:39.005
Clear.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.717
Clear.

37:42.761 --> 37:43.761
Clear.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.014
All clear.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.560
There's no one here.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.121
We saw the guy land. No way it.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.872
Then he must've burnt you wh,

38:12.916 --> 38:13.581
'cause the placewas scrubbed cl!

38:13.625 --> 38:15.250
No one saw us.

38:15.294 --> 38:17.711
Who else did you tellabout the?

38:17.754 --> 38:19.337
Just the people in this room.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.798
If there's a leak,

38:21.842 --> 38:23.425
it means whoever's running WMD

38:23.468 --> 38:25.385
has a Fed on the inside.

38:25.429 --> 38:27.012
Not a chance.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.222
What about the runner? The guy t?

38:29.266 --> 38:33.018
He'll be laying low.-Doesn't m.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.061
You got an address?-I go.

38:35.105 --> 38:38.606
Address comes back to aproject.
