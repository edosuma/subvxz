00:09.139 --> 00:10.923
Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:10.967 --> 00:12.621
They pumped my stomach.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.101
I'm not paying for that.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.885
Not when a good burp
would've saved you.

00:15.928 --> 00:16.886
NAOMI:
I've known for some time

00:16.929 --> 00:18.540
about Karl's indiscretions.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.716
I was picking up
my dry cleaning,

00:20.759 --> 00:23.153
and there was his car,
parked across the street

00:23.197 --> 00:24.981
at some seedy motel.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.113
You still want
to make love to me?

00:26.156 --> 00:27.810
Yeah.I'm free today at 4:00.

00:27.853 --> 00:28.811
Where should we go?

00:28.854 --> 00:30.987
You're a man now;
figure it out.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.948
There's no way I'm getting
into your mobile sex den.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.475
You seem, uh... energized.

00:40.518 --> 00:41.911
Do I?

00:41.954 --> 00:44.131
Have you embarked on
a new exercise regimen?

00:44.174 --> 00:48.091
I plan on working out
as often as I can.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.266
ELI: The other day,
she was going on and on

00:49.310 --> 00:50.702
about how much
she liked my movie.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.530
You know what? We've already
got an open marriage...

00:52.574 --> 00:54.010
I'll ask her for a three-way.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.577
If she says no...

00:55.620 --> 00:57.927
She says yes.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.407
Oh, my God.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.756
You in love with her?

01:00.799 --> 01:02.540
TAYLOR:
You've been insecure lately

01:02.584 --> 01:04.412
because of your career.Are you in love with her?

01:04.455 --> 01:05.543
No.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.110
BETH ANN:
Has your married man

01:07.154 --> 01:08.503
ever told you

01:08.546 --> 01:09.852
why he feels the need to cheat?

01:09.895 --> 01:11.506
He was bored with his wife.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.421
SHEILA:
It's a manual.
For married couples.

01:13.464 --> 01:14.596
These are dirty pictures.

01:14.639 --> 01:15.727
They're scientific.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.773
I have to concentrate.

01:20.906 --> 01:21.951
Ow, ow, ow!

01:23.692 --> 01:25.085
Rob, please don't go.

01:25.128 --> 01:27.304
This has been
an awkward night.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.089
I need to make an appearance.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.091
They must be important clients.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.396
Don't wait up.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.756
♪ L is for the way you look

01:44.800 --> 01:47.542

♪ For me and you...

02:48.690 --> 02:51.562
It begins quite slowly.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.303
With a look.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.175
Or a gesture.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.525
And once the invitation
is accepted...

02:58.569 --> 03:00.484
The tango begins.

03:05.402 --> 03:07.752
It is a dance of anticipation.

03:07.796 --> 03:11.147
Seduction.Desire.

03:12.366 --> 03:15.107
And love.

03:23.377 --> 03:26.336
You know, some say
it takes two to tango.

03:26.380 --> 03:30.775
But sometimes,
lurking in the dark...

03:30.819 --> 03:32.560
Is a third.

03:44.876 --> 03:46.965
Now, if you choose
to dance with him,

03:47.009 --> 03:49.620
be prepared to deal
with the consequences.

03:49.664 --> 03:53.276
For passion can
turn to jealousy.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.931
Love can become violent.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.812
Yes. The tango exists
to remind us

04:07.856 --> 04:10.424
the greatest love stories...

04:10.467 --> 04:14.297
End in death.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.308
Just a reminder,

04:25.352 --> 04:27.571
I've got that project
due tomorrow.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.617
So you'll be working late again?

04:29.660 --> 04:30.879
Afraid so.

04:32.141 --> 04:33.708
Sorry, honey.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.537
What are your big
plans for the day?

04:36.580 --> 04:39.279
Oh, nothing interesting.

04:39.322 --> 04:42.064
Need to drop by
the dry cleaners.

04:42.107 --> 04:45.894
After that, I'll go
to the market for some shopping.

04:45.937 --> 04:48.940
And then I might have lunch
with a new friend.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.295
This is your phone number.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.600
Oh, I thought
you should have it,

04:56.644 --> 04:57.949
now that we're getting
to be chums.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.951
This way,
if you ever need someone

04:59.995 --> 05:01.301
to go with you to the movies...

05:01.344 --> 05:03.128
I can call you up. Got it.

05:03.172 --> 05:07.045
Now, I rent a room
from a lovely couple.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.699
The wife's name

05:08.743 --> 05:10.005
is also Sheila.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.354
Oh.
So,

05:11.398 --> 05:13.269
if you call and she answers...

05:13.313 --> 05:15.010
Then I'll ask
for the other Sheila.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.968
Exactly. Busy this week?

05:17.012 --> 05:20.494
Uh, my schedule is pretty open,
except for tonight.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.714
I have a date.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.369
With your married man?

05:26.413 --> 05:28.632
He finished some big project
at work. To celebrate,

05:28.676 --> 05:32.375
he got us reservations
at this really fancy night club.

05:32.419 --> 05:35.030
He's taking you out?

05:35.073 --> 05:36.901
In public?

05:36.945 --> 05:40.252
For the first time.
It's like an actual boyfriend.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.778
Isn't that nice?

05:48.304 --> 05:49.610
What are you smiling about?

05:49.653 --> 05:51.133
Oh, the absurdity of it all.

05:51.176 --> 05:52.830
I'm having the best sex
of my life

05:52.874 --> 05:55.442
in the back of a catering van.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.271
Well, maybe when Mr. Grove
moves out,

05:59.315 --> 06:02.318
we could start
doing this in your bed.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.885
Yes...

06:03.928 --> 06:05.887
So, about that...

06:05.930 --> 06:10.935
Karl may be staying in my home
longer than we discussed.

06:14.025 --> 06:17.289
How much longer? A week?

06:17.333 --> 06:19.074
Longer.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.076
Two weeks?

06:21.119 --> 06:24.253
He won't be leaving until
after my daughter's wedding.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.429
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.476
That's two months away.

06:29.519 --> 06:32.392
Well, I don't mind the van.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.697
No, that's-that's not the point.

06:33.741 --> 06:36.787
Simone, he cheated
on you with men.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.572
Why would you let him stay
for five more seconds?

06:38.615 --> 06:40.487
Well, I tried to throw him out.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.011
And he wouldn't go?He said that if
I made him leave,

06:43.054 --> 06:44.839
he would tell all my
friends he was gay

06:44.882 --> 06:47.102
and embarrass me
before the wedding.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.538
So he's threatening you?

06:48.582 --> 06:52.237
No, it's just
a little light blackmail.

06:53.630 --> 06:56.981
All right.
I'll take care of this.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.983
What does that mean?

06:59.027 --> 07:02.465
Nothing. I'm just gonna convince
him that he's making a mistake.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.075
That's adorable.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.337
Hey, I'm serious.

07:05.381 --> 07:06.991
Please, let me help.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.254
Absolutely not.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.952
I'm not gonna break any bones.

07:12.083 --> 07:15.086
I'm just gonna
bend some stuff.

07:15.130 --> 07:18.742
Tommy, how do you expect our
secret affair to remain secret

07:18.786 --> 07:20.309
once you've been
arrested by the police

07:20.352 --> 07:22.311
for beating up my husband?

07:22.354 --> 07:24.182
I was just spitballing.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.533
Well, I appreciate
the passion,

07:26.576 --> 07:29.361
but save it for the van.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.019
I'd still love
to meet Karl alone

07:35.063 --> 07:36.760
in a dark alley some night.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.501
Careful.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.373
He might enjoy that.

07:48.032 --> 07:51.253
Yes. Um, no, I understand,

07:51.296 --> 07:53.647
it's just that I've been through
the deposition twice

07:53.690 --> 07:55.562
and I couldn't
find anything useful.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.738
Eli.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.697
Eli.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.525
Oh, hey.Yes.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.222
I will check again.

08:04.266 --> 08:07.225
Sure.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.053
What's that?

08:09.097 --> 08:11.447
Got it this morning.
It's pretty sweet, right?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.580
Uh, don't you already
have a guitar?

08:13.623 --> 08:16.408
Yeah, no, honey, this is a bass.

08:16.452 --> 08:19.020
Five strings, it sounds
totally different. Check it out.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.329
Very cool.
Yeah.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.593
Oh, are you going
to the kitchen?Yeah.

08:26.636 --> 08:27.768
Could you grab me a soda?

08:27.811 --> 08:28.943
Sure.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.771
With the, the crushy ice?

08:30.814 --> 08:32.816
Mm-hmm.Love you.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.909
Hey.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.346
Hey. Did you hear the big news?

08:41.390 --> 08:43.087
Eli bought a bass.

08:43.131 --> 08:44.959
Oh, I heard.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.396
He thinks it's gonna help him
work through his writer's block.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.877
Great. That's how he ended up
with his other guitar,

08:49.920 --> 08:51.661
the Xbox and the elliptical.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.141
Got it.

08:53.184 --> 08:56.274
So, how was your day?

08:56.318 --> 08:58.189
Mm.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.931
It was crazy busy. I didn't
even get a chance to eat lunch.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.977
Oh, God, you have to try this.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.413
Here.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.589
It's hot. Careful.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.591
Mmm.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.593
That's amazing.It's good, right?

09:10.637 --> 09:15.076
Yeah. So, did Eli get
any work done today?

09:15.119 --> 09:16.904
I'm not sure.
I was running errands.

09:16.947 --> 09:19.080
Why don't you ask him?No.

09:19.123 --> 09:21.038
If I ask Eli,
"Did you get any writing done?"

09:21.082 --> 09:23.737
what he hears is,
"nag, nag, nag, nag, nag."

09:23.780 --> 09:27.349
Ah.I'm just gonna say nothing
and be supportive.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.743
This is my supportive smile.
Tell me what you think.

09:31.701 --> 09:32.833
It's terrifying.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.316
Hey, I have an idea.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.928
After dinner, let's go dancing.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.625
Tonight?Yeah. There's
this new club

09:42.669 --> 09:45.541
in Silver Lake
I've been dying to check out.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.412
I have a lot of reading
to do for work.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.023
Oh, come on.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.460
You've been so stressed,
and I can't remember

09:51.503 --> 09:53.680
the last time
we went dancing together.

09:53.723 --> 09:57.640
I could use some alone time,
just you and me.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.076
Really?
Mm-hmm.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.035
So we can go clubbing?

10:01.078 --> 10:04.212
Clubbing?
Eli.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.866
Thought you were
playing your bass.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.519
Thought you were
grabbing me a soda.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.695
I was getting to it.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.435
So you guys
are going clubbing, huh?

10:11.959 --> 10:13.569
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.223
All right. I'm in.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.225
Eli, you don't dance.

10:17.268 --> 10:20.097
I dance. In my way.

10:20.141 --> 10:23.187
When you dance, you're
in everyone's way.

10:23.231 --> 10:26.190
Oh...

10:26.234 --> 10:28.366
What? You guys really
don't want me to come?

10:29.411 --> 10:30.847
No. No, no, no.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.675
We'd love for you
to come. Right?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.721
Absolutely.

10:36.505 --> 10:39.639
Whoa. Creepy smile.

10:45.035 --> 10:47.864
Karl?

10:47.908 --> 10:49.953
NAOMI:
There she is.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.826
Naomi.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.176
Did we have plans?

10:55.219 --> 10:56.612
No, I just popped in
with a question.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.048
Karl said you went
to the post office,

10:58.092 --> 10:59.267
and so I waited.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.529
For an hour.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.749
Yes. We need
to talk about

11:02.792 --> 11:04.315
the entertainment
for the benefit.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.535
Benefit.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.493
For the burn victims.

11:08.537 --> 11:09.799
Oh, my God.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.148
I forgot all about it.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.324
Simone, you're in charge
of the decorations.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.152
It's fine. I ordered
everything weeks ago.

11:15.196 --> 11:18.634
My mind's been elsewhere
because of recent events.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.462
Are you still up
for your number?

11:20.505 --> 11:23.770
Simone promised the two of
you would reprise your dance.

11:23.813 --> 11:24.901
From the country
club's talent show.

11:24.945 --> 11:27.164
Oh, did she?

11:27.208 --> 11:30.994
I'm not sure I'm up for it now,
given recent events.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.430
Well, if you don't
do something,

11:32.474 --> 11:35.172
Ida Ford is threatening
to sing opera.

11:35.216 --> 11:38.219
Oh, darling. Haven't the burn
victims suffered enough?

11:38.262 --> 11:39.437
All right.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.570
We'll perform.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.876
I'm so glad.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.182
And remember:

11:45.226 --> 11:48.708
if you ever need
to talk about anything,

11:48.751 --> 11:51.711
I am always here.

11:51.754 --> 11:54.539
Yes. You certainly seem to be.

11:56.846 --> 11:59.022
Why did you let her inside?

11:59.066 --> 12:00.894
I'm the one
who should be miffed.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.374
Why didn't you tell me
Naomi saw my car at a motel?

12:03.418 --> 12:04.680
We're lucky that's all she saw.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.725
If she knew
you were having

12:05.768 --> 12:07.639
anonymous sex
with strange men...

12:07.683 --> 12:09.598
It was never anonymous.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.382
And only a few of them
were strange.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.386
I am not the audience
for that joke.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.174
What areyou doing?Benefit's in two days.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.349
We need to rehearse.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.567
Ugh, what was I thinking?

12:22.611 --> 12:24.221
I can't dance with you,
I'm still furious.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.354
You'll forget all about that

12:26.397 --> 12:27.529
when we're the center
of attention,

12:27.572 --> 12:28.965
drowning in applause.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.227
Stop trying to charm your way
back into my heart.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.707
It won't work.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.143
Now, you see,
I think you've forgotten

12:33.187 --> 12:34.754
how much fun we have together.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.756
And I am determined
to remind you.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.846
Why are you trying so hard
to hold onto me?

12:39.889 --> 12:41.804
Because I love you, my darling.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.588
Well, I'm not sure
that's enough.

12:43.632 --> 12:46.287
Well, try this on
for size.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.202
I actually like you.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.465
How many of your husbands
can say that?

13:02.869 --> 13:04.871
Oh, hey. Ooh, thanks.

13:06.437 --> 13:07.917
Oh, crap.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.527
What? What's wrong?

13:09.571 --> 13:10.833
I think I just saw
my agent.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.531
Lamar's here?
Why don't you go say hi?

13:13.575 --> 13:14.750
No, he's just gonna
give me a hard time

13:14.794 --> 13:16.099
about finishing the script.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.319
There's an easy way
to get him off your back.

13:18.362 --> 13:21.104
What's that?Finish your script.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.976
This kind of attitude is why

13:23.019 --> 13:25.413
I introduce you to people
as my first wife.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.937
Yeah, that's funny.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.547
Is everything okay?

13:29.591 --> 13:31.985
Yeah. I just really want
to dance with you right now.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.334
Yeah, let's do it.Okay.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.815
Come on.WOMAN: Jade!

13:35.858 --> 13:37.338
Oh, my God!

13:37.381 --> 13:38.818
Wischa! Oh, my God!

13:40.645 --> 13:42.647
Did she say "Wischa"?

13:42.691 --> 13:44.258
I think so.You guys.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.303
These are my friends,
Willow and Mischa.

13:46.347 --> 13:49.567
Wischa. Ah, I get it.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.221
This is, uh, Taylor and Eli.

13:51.265 --> 13:52.788
How do you two know Jade?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.790
Oh...

13:54.834 --> 13:56.009
We met her last year.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.054
Oh, and it was
love at first sight.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.926
JADE:
Oh, my God, you guys!

13:59.969 --> 14:02.624
Girl, you look
fucking amazing.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.366
Mmm, when fucking
doesn't she?

14:05.409 --> 14:07.063
Fucking never.

14:12.199 --> 14:15.202
I'm getting the feeling that we
weren't Jade's first threesome.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.290
Mm-hmm.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.643
I don't get it.
Why would you want

14:21.686 --> 14:23.514
to start palling around
with this tramp?

14:23.558 --> 14:26.213
Because I want to stop her
from seeing my husband.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.215
And how is buying her
popcorn at the Rialto

14:28.258 --> 14:29.390
gonna make that happen?

14:29.433 --> 14:31.131
I'm trying to
establish trust.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.698
If a stranger came up and
said your dress was ugly,

14:33.742 --> 14:35.048
what would you say?

14:35.091 --> 14:37.050
I'd say fuck off.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.703
But if a dear friend
gently suggested

14:38.747 --> 14:40.662
orange is not
your best color?

14:42.316 --> 14:43.708
I'd get rid of the dress.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.407
If I'm to convince April

14:46.450 --> 14:48.583
it's not in her
best interest

14:48.626 --> 14:49.845
to date a married man,

14:49.889 --> 14:52.108
first I must become
her confidant.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.415
Her close advisor.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.244
Okay.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.941
So when does this
new friendship

14:58.985 --> 15:01.117
begin to blossom?Tonight.

15:01.161 --> 15:03.163
I thought Rob was taking her
to the club tonight.

15:03.206 --> 15:07.167
Do you honestly think I'm
going to let that happen?

15:15.827 --> 15:17.742
You all right?

15:17.786 --> 15:20.223
No, I'm nervous.Why?

15:20.267 --> 15:22.965
Everyone we know
will be in this room tonight.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.359
You've dazzled them all
a hundred times.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.709
Because I knew how much
they envied me.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.233
They'd laugh in my face if
they knew the truth about us.

15:30.277 --> 15:33.323
Here's a thought.
Don't tell them.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.151
People will be able
to figure it out.

15:35.195 --> 15:38.024
Do you honestly believe
we're the only couple here

15:38.067 --> 15:39.721
pretending to be something
that we're not?

15:39.764 --> 15:42.115
No.
Trust me,

15:42.158 --> 15:43.725
there is not a woman
here tonight

15:43.768 --> 15:45.422
who wouldn't trade
all of her problems for yours

15:45.466 --> 15:46.641
if she looked
half as beautiful

15:46.684 --> 15:48.643
as you do right now.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.297
But what good is
other people's envy

15:50.340 --> 15:52.212
if it's all based on a lie?

15:52.255 --> 15:54.475
I'm not sure.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.520
Let's find out.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.961
Simone!
You look stunning.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.353
And you look like a teenager.

16:03.397 --> 16:06.356
How do you get
your skin so soft?Oh!

16:06.400 --> 16:07.836
It's called a chemical peel.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.664
I know. One more
and she'll be

16:09.707 --> 16:11.579
the Phantom of the Opera.

16:11.622 --> 16:14.147
Simone!
Darling.
Hello, Barclay.

16:14.190 --> 16:17.193
Sandy, you're out of rehab.

16:17.237 --> 16:20.109
Don't worry, I'll be back.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.372
Maybe I should go
and find our table.No need.

16:22.416 --> 16:23.895
I've arranged for us all
to sit here.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.636
Together? What fun.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.725
I think this is a good time
to find the bar.

16:27.769 --> 16:30.119
Liquor's on it's way,
Simone, brought to you by

16:30.163 --> 16:32.904
the most adorable waiter
at the party.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.039
Wine, Mrs. Grove?

16:37.083 --> 16:40.347
Tommy.

16:40.390 --> 16:41.739
You're our waiter?

16:41.783 --> 16:43.567
Yes, Mrs. Grove.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.178
Mr. Grove.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.354
Hello.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.659
Shall we, darling?

16:50.270 --> 16:54.317
So, Mischa, what do
you guys do for a living?

16:54.361 --> 16:56.058
Oh, uh, we're influencers.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.668
Influencers?

16:57.712 --> 16:58.974
On Instagram.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.454
We're sort of famous.

17:00.497 --> 17:01.803
Are you?

17:01.846 --> 17:03.544
Yeah, it's called
@UnderwearEverywhere.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.328
All these underwear brands
pay us stupid money

17:05.372 --> 17:08.288
to post pictures
wearing their stuff.

17:08.331 --> 17:11.073
At famous landmarks,
like, all over the world.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.248
Yo, check it.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.165
TAYLOR:
Oh, wow.

17:16.209 --> 17:18.689
And the Taj Mahal people,
they were okay with that?

17:18.733 --> 17:20.561
Ah, we were in and out
lickety-split.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.563
We had the best time.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.958
We've missed you,
little Jade.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.178
Oh, I missed you.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.267
So, um, how long
are you guys here?

17:31.311 --> 17:34.705
We leave tomorrow night
for Venice.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.925
No.Oh, so soon.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.622
Oh, that sucks.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.060
I was hoping I'd have more time
to hang out with you guys.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.365
Yeah, it sucks.

17:42.409 --> 17:44.150
Wait, Mischa.
What?

17:44.193 --> 17:45.760
I just had an idea.

17:45.803 --> 17:48.545
I know what you're thinking,
and it's fucking brilliant.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.331
What are you thinking?

17:51.374 --> 17:52.680
Come with us to Venice tomorrow.

17:52.723 --> 17:55.726
Oh, my God.Tomorrow? Really?

17:55.770 --> 17:57.380
Yeah, it would be so much fun.

17:57.424 --> 17:58.512
Well...

17:58.555 --> 18:00.122
She doesn't have
a plane ticket.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.081
Our assistant can
take care of that.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.778
You guys have an assistant?BOTH: Yeah.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.041
Guys, come on,
it's such short notice.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.347
That'll cost a fortune.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.436
Oh, please, we've got
tons of miles.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.002
JADE: Really?WILLOW: Yeah.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.308
Do you have
a current passport?

18:12.352 --> 18:13.440
I think so, yeah.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.268
Oh, my God.

18:15.311 --> 18:16.573
Um, hold on.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.054
You can't just leave
the country on a whim.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.622
It's irresponsible.

18:21.665 --> 18:25.843
Okay, Mom.
Geez, calm down.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.497
Excuse me?

18:28.890 --> 18:30.021
Oh, my God!

18:30.065 --> 18:33.721
Oh... this song is my jam!

18:33.764 --> 18:36.202
Guys, let's dance.
Come on.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.768
Yeah, let's dance.All right, let's do it.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.292
Come on.
Let's go, bro.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.423
Me? Yeah?
Yeah.

18:40.467 --> 18:43.383
Let's do it.
All right.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.385
I'm going with him. So...

18:53.436 --> 18:54.394
Stanton speaking.

18:54.437 --> 18:55.743
Rob, it's me.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.441
Well, this is a nice surprise.

18:58.485 --> 18:59.921
I don't mean to bother,

18:59.964 --> 19:01.923
but I'm making tuna casserole
for dinner.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.534
Do you prefer bread crumbs
or not?

19:04.578 --> 19:06.188
Honey, I told you
I'm working late tonight.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.886
Oh. Did I forget?

19:08.930 --> 19:10.845
Yeah, our deadline for

19:10.888 --> 19:12.020
the project is
tomorrow morning.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.239
Right.

19:13.282 --> 19:15.545
What was the name of that again?

19:15.589 --> 19:16.938
The Delphi Project.

19:16.981 --> 19:19.419
Of course.
Of course, well,

19:19.462 --> 19:20.724
I'll let you get back to work.

19:20.768 --> 19:21.986
Now, remember, don't wait up.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.511
I won't be home
till the wee hours.

19:24.554 --> 19:27.340
Oh, poor baby.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.558
Well...

19:45.445 --> 19:47.098
Hello, Claire.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.970
Mrs. Stanton.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.014
Your husband didn't tell me
you were gonna stop by.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.016
Oh, Rob isn't expecting me.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.496
This is something of a surprise.

19:56.107 --> 19:58.022
I am desperate
for a cup of coffee.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.415
Could you be so kind?

19:59.459 --> 20:02.940
Well, I'm-I'm not supposed
to leave my desk.

20:02.984 --> 20:06.944
Claire, how often do I
ask you for favors?

20:06.988 --> 20:09.251
Sure, Mrs. Stanton.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.470
I'll be back in a jif.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.167
Don't rush, dear.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.691
Take your time.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.089
Hi there.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.832
Beth Ann.
What are you doing here?

20:24.875 --> 20:26.268
I couldn't bear
the thought of you

20:26.312 --> 20:28.096
getting your dinner
from a vending machine.

20:28.139 --> 20:32.100
Wow, that's thoughtful.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.797
I know you have a kitchen
around here somewhere.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.973
You can pop it in the fridge
until you're ready to eat.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.801
Sure.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.629
Claire, can you come
in here for a second?

20:43.938 --> 20:46.723
Claire?

20:46.767 --> 20:49.160
Ah, she must have wandered off.

20:49.204 --> 20:51.162
I'm sure she'll be back soon.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.990
Now, Robert,

20:53.034 --> 20:55.645
I went to all the trouble
of making this casserole.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.125
I don't want the tuna to spoil.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.133
I will put it
in the fridge.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.461
Mrs. Stanton,
here's your coffee.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.463
Oh, you're so sweet.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.247
It's very hot. You might
want to give it a moment

21:32.291 --> 21:34.162
to cool off.
Oh, I don't have
time to wait.

21:34.205 --> 21:35.163
I have things to do.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.643
Oh, it'll just take a sec.

21:36.686 --> 21:38.471
You're a treasure. Tell Rob
I'll see him back home.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.781
Who said you could have
a coffee break?

21:55.401 --> 21:56.924
NAOMI:
I was so flattered.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.361
Usually when Tommy's company
caters one of my events,

21:59.405 --> 22:00.797
he refuses to wait on me.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.799
But tonight, he asked
for this table.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.061
Did he?

22:04.105 --> 22:05.846
KARL: The theme
of this evening

22:05.889 --> 22:07.282
is "South of the Border."

22:07.326 --> 22:09.284
Yes.So, who chose

22:09.328 --> 22:11.155
the flamenco outfits
for the waiters?

22:11.199 --> 22:13.462
I did. Why?

22:13.506 --> 22:14.985
Flamenco is Spanish.

22:15.029 --> 22:18.162
Isn't that what
they speak down there?

22:18.206 --> 22:20.121
Spanish, as in Spain.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.384
Yes, but it still counts
as south of the border.

22:22.428 --> 22:25.039
Yes, if the border
is with France.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.954
Oh, do you see what
I have to live with?

22:26.997 --> 22:28.651
Such a know-it-all.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.087
Yes, I'm forever
flouting my knowledge

22:30.131 --> 22:31.959
that Spain is in Europe.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.439
SANDY:
Naomi,

22:33.482 --> 22:35.092
can I just say I'm stunned

22:35.136 --> 22:36.877
at how handsome
your son's become.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.227
I'm stunned he can
breathe in those pants.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.318
Karl...

22:43.362 --> 22:45.015
you're making
Tommy uncomfortable.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.104
Me? I'm not the one
who dressed him up

22:47.148 --> 22:49.498
as a backup dancer
to Liza Minnelli.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.065
Another scotch,
please, young man.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.110
Yes, Mr. Grove.

22:53.154 --> 22:54.460
Very good.
Thank you.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.592
Hurry back, Tommy.

22:56.636 --> 23:00.161
Can you believe how she's
flirting with my son?

23:00.204 --> 23:01.945
Oh, Sandy is just being playful.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.992
He's 18. She's 32.

23:05.035 --> 23:08.648
Don't you think
that's pathetic?

23:08.691 --> 23:12.521
Excuse me.

23:12.565 --> 23:15.655
Vodka rocks, please.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.657
You have to switch tables.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.919
I can't.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.224
Then at least
stop glaring at Karl.

23:20.268 --> 23:21.574
He's such a jerk.

23:21.617 --> 23:22.879
He's just trying
to be funny.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.490
He's insulting
your dignity.

23:24.533 --> 23:28.276
You can't say that
in those sleeves.

23:28.319 --> 23:29.538
Ah, vodka rocks.

23:29.582 --> 23:33.368
Thank you. Mmm.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.588
You've found
your calling.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.595
Hey!

23:42.638 --> 23:44.118
There you are.

23:44.161 --> 23:46.816
Here I are.Why aren't you dancing?

23:46.860 --> 23:48.470
I'm tired.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.820
Are you about ready
to go?
Now?

23:50.864 --> 23:53.083
Yeah.
I'm having so much fun
with Wischa.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.999
TAYLOR: Well,
it's after midnight,

23:56.043 --> 23:57.436
and I got to
be up early

23:57.479 --> 23:59.133
and go to my job

23:59.176 --> 24:03.311
that requires me to, you know,
wear clothes, so...

24:04.965 --> 24:06.793
How many of those
have you had?

24:06.836 --> 24:08.534
A couple.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.580
Maybe two couples.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.408
You seem angry.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.323
I'm not angry.

24:15.366 --> 24:18.805
Unless you're going to Venice
with those low-rent Kardashians.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.764
Hey. Taylor, be nice.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.157
Those are my friends.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.115
Yeah, and I'm just
the person who saved you

24:25.159 --> 24:28.510
from an abusive relationship
and let you live in my house,

24:28.554 --> 24:30.556
but fuck me, right?

24:30.599 --> 24:34.821
Okay. Um, I think maybe
you should go home,

24:34.864 --> 24:36.910
and I will...

24:36.953 --> 24:39.042
I'll see you later.
Okay.

24:39.086 --> 24:42.306
Okay?
Yeah.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.526
Hey.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.181
Are you going to Venice?

24:49.183 --> 24:50.532
I don't know yet.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.709
Fine. Go!

24:53.753 --> 24:55.581
Have the best time.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.851
Come on.
What? Now?

25:04.894 --> 25:06.983
Yeah, now.Okay.

25:07.027 --> 25:09.508
Stanton residence.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.422
ROB :
Honey, thank God you're there.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.641
Rob.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.687
You sound upset.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.210
Listen, when you were
in my office earlier,

25:16.253 --> 25:18.168
did you happen to move
any papers?

25:18.212 --> 25:19.866
What are you talking about?

25:19.909 --> 25:21.476
The final draft
of the Delphi Project.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.696
It was here on my desk
and now it's gone.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.741
Did you look under your desk?

25:25.785 --> 25:27.438
Yes, I've looked everywhere.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.440
Now, this is
incredibly important.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.878
Are you sure
you didn't touch it?

25:31.921 --> 25:34.358
I know better than
to touch your things.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.143
Damn it.

25:36.186 --> 25:39.276
If I don't find this thing, I'll
have to stay late and redo it,

25:39.320 --> 25:41.278
the whole goddamn thing.

25:41.322 --> 25:43.454
I thought you were
working late anyway.

25:43.498 --> 25:47.807
Uh... that was on
something else.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.897
It doesn't matter. I have to go.
I-I have to go.

26:00.863 --> 26:02.386
Yeah?

26:02.430 --> 26:03.474
APRIL :
Hi, I'd like to speak to Sheila.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.346
You're talking to her.
Who's this?

26:05.389 --> 26:08.218
I think I mean your roommate,
the other Sheila.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.438
Um, this is April
from the diner.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.483
Oh, oh!

26:12.527 --> 26:15.530
Oh, uh, Jesus,
all right, hold on.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.509
You-know-who

26:38.553 --> 26:41.077
is on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.428
Hm. I thought she might.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.083
April?

26:47.127 --> 26:49.346
APRIL:
Hi. I know this is late notice,

26:49.390 --> 26:52.480
but would you like to come
with me to the club tonight?

26:52.523 --> 26:53.742
Rob cancelled on me.

26:53.786 --> 26:56.049
I'm a mess
right now, but

26:56.092 --> 26:58.007
I guess I could
throw myself together.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.182
Oh, good.

26:59.226 --> 27:00.488
It's the White Diamond Bar
in Burbank.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.707
I'll meet you there in an hour.

27:01.750 --> 27:02.969
I'll be there.

27:04.405 --> 27:07.800
What's going on?Show some respect, kids.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.150
You're in the presence
of greatness.

27:12.369 --> 27:13.632
TOMMY:
Careful, everybody.

27:13.675 --> 27:14.807
These bowls are hot.Ooh!

27:14.850 --> 27:16.417
Tortilla soup.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.811
You can't say this isn't
"South of the Border."

27:18.854 --> 27:20.290
Given Simone's grasp
of geography,

27:20.334 --> 27:21.988
I'm surprised we're
not having clam chowder.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.470
By the way,

27:26.514 --> 27:29.343
have you all heard the latest
news about Larry and Sue?

27:29.386 --> 27:30.561
What about them?

27:30.605 --> 27:32.172
They've separated.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.914
No!
Are you really
that surprised?

27:34.957 --> 27:36.350
They fought constantly.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.482
In my day, people stayed married

27:38.526 --> 27:40.484
and found a way
to work things out.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.704
Well, that's not
always possible.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.401
NAOMI:
Simone's right.

27:44.445 --> 27:46.665
People can care deeply
for one another,

27:46.708 --> 27:48.623
it doesn't always mean that
they should stay married.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.190
You see, this is where
I think commitment

27:50.233 --> 27:52.192
becomes essential.

27:52.235 --> 27:54.107
Everyone
makes mistakes,

27:54.150 --> 27:55.978
but if love is there,

27:56.022 --> 27:57.458
then there's a path
to redemption.

27:57.501 --> 27:58.720
BARCLAY:
Easy for you to say.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.722
You and Simone
have the perfect marriage.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.158
Oh, hardly.

28:02.202 --> 28:05.684
There are days
when Simone regrets marrying me.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.773
Am I right,
my darling?

28:07.816 --> 28:10.210
More than a few. Yes, I imagine she dreams

28:10.253 --> 28:12.081
of stifling me
with a pillow

28:12.125 --> 28:13.779
or casting me aside
like an old shoe.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.911
Oh, honey, you know
I'd never throw away a shoe.

28:15.955 --> 28:19.088
But you don't get rid of me that
easily. You see, she gave me

28:19.132 --> 28:20.437
her hand in marriage.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.788
SIMONE: Karl...KARL: And I'm never

28:22.831 --> 28:24.615
going to let it go.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.966
Oh!

28:27.009 --> 28:28.228
KARL:
Bloody hell!

28:28.271 --> 28:29.708
Tommy, how could you
be so clumsy?

28:29.751 --> 28:32.101
Sorry, Mr. Grove.

28:32.145 --> 28:35.496
Let me get you some napkins.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.980
Clearly, he did that on purpose.

28:41.023 --> 28:42.982
No, he just wasn't
paying attention.

28:43.025 --> 28:46.072
You know how
teenagers are.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.473
Okay, sober person, here we go.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.084
Give me this.

28:58.127 --> 29:00.347
Stop. Hey.
Eli, don't rush me.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.958
I'm not rushing you. There.

29:03.002 --> 29:06.614
You know what? I don't get it.

29:06.657 --> 29:08.007
What's that?
What don't you get?

29:08.050 --> 29:09.835
I don't get what Jade sees
in those people.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.706
Wischa?
Yeah.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.534
They're fake as shit.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.971
Yes, they are.
Okay, legs, pants.

29:16.015 --> 29:17.930
And you know what?

29:17.973 --> 29:20.759
Why would anyone want to see
them in their underwear?

29:20.802 --> 29:21.977
Ugh.

29:22.021 --> 29:24.632
'Cause they're not even
that pretty.

29:24.675 --> 29:25.981
Do you think they're pretty?

29:26.025 --> 29:28.462
Only their bodies
and their faces.

29:30.986 --> 29:33.859
And now Jade's going with them
to Venice?

29:33.902 --> 29:35.817
Mm-hmm.Fuck her.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.688
What's funny?

29:37.732 --> 29:41.344
You. You're funny 'cause
you're drunk and ridiculous,

29:41.388 --> 29:42.824
and that's a nice
change of pace.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.173
From what?

29:44.217 --> 29:46.175
Well, usually you're the one
taking care of me

29:46.219 --> 29:47.742
when I'm doing something stupid.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.613
I do take care of you.Yes, you do.

29:49.657 --> 29:52.442
I take care of everybody.Okay.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.229
Hey, don't feel bad
in the morning, okay?

29:56.272 --> 29:57.839
Why would I feel bad?

29:57.883 --> 29:59.885
'Cause you'll remember
how rude you were to Jade.

30:02.148 --> 30:03.845
Don't worry, she'll forgive you.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.281
Mm, fuck you.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.718
And so will I.

30:09.677 --> 30:13.507
I am so happy you came.
You look amazing.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.291
It was very kind
for you to invite me.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.032
I never go to places
like this.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.947
Well, if you hadn't come,
I would've had to stay home,

30:18.991 --> 30:21.645
and where is
the fun in that?

30:23.691 --> 30:25.867
It's a shame your fella
couldn't make it.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.652
Yeah, he said he had
to work late, but who knows?

30:28.696 --> 30:31.046
Married men who cheat

30:31.090 --> 30:32.700
also know how to lie.

30:32.743 --> 30:35.877
It must be frustrating.

30:35.921 --> 30:38.314
Never knowing if Rob

30:38.358 --> 30:40.316
is going to stand you up
for his wife.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.536
It can be annoying,

30:42.579 --> 30:44.581
but it's a trade-off.

30:44.625 --> 30:47.193
So what do you get
out of the deal?

30:47.236 --> 30:49.499
Freedom.

30:49.543 --> 30:50.936
See, I don't want
to get married.

30:50.979 --> 30:54.026
So this is just a...

30:54.069 --> 30:55.897
casual fling?

30:55.941 --> 30:58.639
Yeah. Rob's wife will get him
back when I'm done with him,

30:58.682 --> 30:59.858
good as new.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.860
And if he keeps
working late,

31:01.903 --> 31:04.036
it's going to be
in a couple of weeks.

31:04.079 --> 31:07.213
Oh, good. For you.

31:07.256 --> 31:09.563
I mean, good for you.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.523
Where is our waiter?

31:13.567 --> 31:16.831
So, April, why don't you want
to get married?

31:16.875 --> 31:19.878
Because I want to have a career.

31:19.921 --> 31:22.663
Doing what?

31:24.665 --> 31:25.927
I want to be a singer.

31:25.971 --> 31:29.061
Really?

31:29.104 --> 31:31.933
That's kind of why
I wanted to come here.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.153
They have girls that sing
with the combo on the weekends,

31:34.196 --> 31:35.937
so I'm gonna introduce myself
to the manager,

31:35.981 --> 31:40.899
and then I am going
to audition for him.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.465
I had no idea you sang.

31:42.509 --> 31:45.120
I started in the church choir
back at home.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.948
Folks there think
I'm pretty talented.

31:46.992 --> 31:50.256
I'm gonna be somebody someday.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.998
You just watch.

31:56.349 --> 31:59.004
I love music.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.310
I used to play the piano.

32:01.354 --> 32:02.355
No kidding.

32:02.398 --> 32:03.922
Yeah, I took
lessons for years.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.097
Well, do you
still play?

32:05.140 --> 32:07.447
The truth is,

32:07.490 --> 32:11.625
my husband didn't care
for my playing.

32:11.668 --> 32:14.454
I made the mistake of telling
him I wanted to give a recital,

32:14.497 --> 32:15.934
and he just laughed.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.806
He said I wasn't as good
as I thought I was.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.939
That sort of

32:20.982 --> 32:23.506
took the wind out of my sail.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.726
Oh, honey.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.426
Your husband's dead.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.038
Don't you think it's time
you stopped listening to him?

32:36.824 --> 32:41.481
Can I just say I am very happy
to be here tonight?

32:41.524 --> 32:44.397
Well, here's to us.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.319
Taylor, what are you doing?

32:53.362 --> 32:55.799
You were right.
I have to go find Jade.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.063
It's 4:00 in the morning.

32:58.106 --> 33:02.023
I was such a bitch,
and now she's going to Venice,

33:02.067 --> 33:04.983
and it's all my fault,
and I have to fix this.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.072
All right, well, you don't
even know where she is.

33:07.115 --> 33:09.944
Yes, I do, okay?
I-I-- She's at their hotel.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.816
How do you know that?I put Find My Friends
on her phone.

33:12.860 --> 33:15.602
You're tracking her?I got to go.

33:15.645 --> 33:18.257
Oh, my God.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.738
Hey, what the fuck
has gotten into you?

33:21.782 --> 33:23.262
I can't lose her.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.307
Well, you can wait until
she gets home to talk to her.

33:25.351 --> 33:26.874
What if she
doesn't come back?

33:26.917 --> 33:28.876
What if she's already
on a plane to Venice

33:28.919 --> 33:30.051
and I never see her again?

33:30.095 --> 33:31.835
You just said
she's at the hotel.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.489
I need her.

33:33.533 --> 33:36.623
If she leaves, this whole
fucking thing falls apart.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.194
No...

33:42.237 --> 33:43.673
No.

33:43.717 --> 33:44.805
Stop the car.

33:46.241 --> 33:48.200
What does that mean?

33:48.243 --> 33:50.071
What whole thing falls apart?

33:50.115 --> 33:51.551
Eli, get off.

33:51.594 --> 33:52.682
No, you're gonna get out

33:52.726 --> 33:53.553
and you're gonna
talk to me right now,

33:53.596 --> 33:54.728
Taylor.

33:55.772 --> 33:57.165
Really?

34:03.345 --> 34:05.173
Just talk to me, Taylor.

34:07.480 --> 34:08.872
What's going on?

34:08.916 --> 34:10.352
Come on.

34:10.396 --> 34:13.660
I asked you before
if you were in love with her.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.009
I-I know, I know.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.837
You lied to me.Not exactly.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.926
Then what the hell
are we doing in the driveway?

34:18.969 --> 34:20.928
Eli, come on, please.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.234
This is, this is too hard!

34:22.277 --> 34:24.105
What?
I-I don't know.

34:24.149 --> 34:27.021
What?My life, my l--
my life is so hard!

34:27.065 --> 34:30.503
I-I... The hours I work,
the cases I take.

34:30.546 --> 34:33.897
And then I come home
to this house.

34:33.941 --> 34:37.597
This big, fucking house
that we can't afford!

34:37.640 --> 34:39.294
And I have
to pay for it

34:39.338 --> 34:42.123
because you haven't sold
a script in two years.

34:43.646 --> 34:44.952
But I can't
bring that up

34:44.995 --> 34:47.215
because then I'm a bitch.

34:47.259 --> 34:50.088
So I say nothing.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.746
And Jade is the only thing
in my life that is easy.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.140
'Cause she
doesn't take.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.186
She only gives.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.234
If she leaves,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

35:08.497 --> 35:10.282
Why didn't you tell me
any of this before?

35:12.371 --> 35:14.547
Come on.

35:14.590 --> 35:16.592
I don't want to hurt you.

35:17.767 --> 35:20.379
Oh, well, great call.

35:20.422 --> 35:22.642
'Cause it hurts.

35:25.253 --> 35:27.212
So, I mean...

35:27.255 --> 35:29.083
Do you want me to go?

35:29.127 --> 35:30.519
No.

35:30.563 --> 35:32.130
Eli, I love you.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.306
But you want her to stay.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.486
I mean...

35:40.529 --> 35:42.531
How does that even work?

35:44.533 --> 35:46.709
I don't know.

35:47.754 --> 35:48.929
I don't.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.801
But it has to.

35:51.845 --> 35:55.153
Because otherwise, it's just
too hard to be married to me.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.635
No. Eli...

36:22.789 --> 36:24.225
I got fired.

36:24.269 --> 36:27.010
I'm not surprised.
What you did was childish.

36:27.054 --> 36:29.709
He was grabbing you.He was holding my hand.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.232
Why do you keep defending him?I'm not.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.016
He's lied to you,
he's cheated on you

36:33.060 --> 36:35.236
and he won't
leave your home.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.195
The situation is complicated.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.327
Well, yeah, it must be,
because it makes no sense.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.547
You should hate him.I know, I know,
it's just...

36:41.590 --> 36:43.679
He's my husband.

36:45.377 --> 36:49.207
He puts up with my extravagance
and my nonsense.

36:50.686 --> 36:54.603
He tells me I'm beautiful when I
need to hear it the most and...

36:54.647 --> 36:57.737
he makes me laugh
in a way that no one else can.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.521
Simone...

36:59.565 --> 37:01.219
One day, I will divorce Karl,

37:01.262 --> 37:03.264
but I will
never hate him,

37:03.308 --> 37:05.919
because I can't.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.880
Where does that leave me?

37:10.924 --> 37:14.449
In the back of a van

37:14.493 --> 37:17.278
having a marvelous time.

37:17.322 --> 37:21.064
Yeah, well, van came
with the job, so...

37:21.108 --> 37:22.675
Don't worry.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.546
We'll figure it out.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.768
Mrs. Grove.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.726
Mrs. Harte says
it's time for your number.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.772
Thank you.

37:38.038 --> 37:40.040
I have to go.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.537
Hi.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.192
Hey.

38:03.498 --> 38:07.372
Listen, about tonight,
I'm so sorry.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.723
You don't have to apologize.No, I do.

38:10.766 --> 38:12.768
I really do.

38:13.987 --> 38:16.685
Thank you.

38:19.732 --> 38:23.344
So, I decided to go to Venice
with Mischa and Willow.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.652
Oh.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.699
JADE:
It's time.

38:30.743 --> 38:33.615
Being here with you
and Eli, it's...

38:34.660 --> 38:37.271
...starting to feel like a home.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.839
I'm getting attached.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.974
Which always leads
to me getting hurt.

38:45.018 --> 38:49.370
When it ends. So...

38:49.414 --> 38:52.721
I should go.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.552
ELI:
What if it doesn't
have to end?

38:58.597 --> 39:00.120
What if you stayed?

39:00.163 --> 39:02.296
What if this was your home?

39:05.517 --> 39:07.214
Here with us.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.392
What are you saying?

39:11.436 --> 39:13.481
Live with us.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.578
Be with us.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.625
Yeah.

39:26.668 --> 39:29.062
There's no reason
to leave.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.412
You just got home.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.644
Hi.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.036
Oh, you're still up.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.864
Of course.

39:48.908 --> 39:51.824
Did you get your work finished?

39:51.867 --> 39:53.521
Yep.

39:53.565 --> 39:56.872
I redid the whole project.
It took forever.

39:58.134 --> 40:00.267
I could fix you
a snack if you like.

40:00.310 --> 40:04.445
No. I'm gonna make myself
a martini, take a shower

40:04.489 --> 40:06.447
and go to bed.

40:06.491 --> 40:09.276
All right.

40:13.889 --> 40:16.979
Would it bother you if I played
the piano for a bit?

40:18.198 --> 40:19.982
It's after midnight.

40:20.026 --> 40:21.680
I know. If you'd rather
I didn't...

40:21.723 --> 40:25.118
Nah. Whatever you want.

41:29.399 --> 41:32.098
Honey, I need an olive
for my martini.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.493
Check the fridge.

42:25.717 --> 42:28.415
I can't find the olives.Top shelf.

42:28.458 --> 42:30.765
I checked. They weren't there.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.290
Check again.

42:34.334 --> 42:35.727
Honey!

42:35.770 --> 42:40.079
It's not really a martini

42:40.122 --> 42:42.385
without an olive.

43:18.247 --> 43:21.207
Thanks. You know,

43:21.250 --> 43:23.992
it is so late.

43:24.036 --> 43:26.038
We should turn in.
