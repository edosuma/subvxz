(chuckles)

01:12.548 --> 01:14.782
Let's get more comfortable, hmm?

01:14.816 --> 01:16.450
That okay?

01:20.022 --> 01:21.322
You nervous?

01:23.392 --> 01:26.294
It seems like you've got
a lot on your mind.

01:26.328 --> 01:28.996
Actually... I do.

01:38.874 --> 01:40.274
What are you doing?

01:40.309 --> 01:42.877
I've passed all my tests.
I'm clean.

01:42.911 --> 01:43.978
Would you mind?

01:46.381 --> 01:48.349
(soft suctioning sound)

01:50.252 --> 01:51.886
(trills)

01:53.922 --> 01:55.623
This won't hurt.

01:58.927 --> 02:02.263
You don't have to do anything
if you don't want to.

02:03.799 --> 02:07.168
People come to me for
all sorts of reasons.

02:07.202 --> 02:10.871
Some want to talk
or just to be held.

02:10.906 --> 02:13.541
Look, why don't we
just have some fun?

02:24.553 --> 02:27.521
People look for connections
in different ways.

02:31.126 --> 02:32.593
Someone who cares about them.

02:32.628 --> 02:34.695
Andrei!

02:58.787 --> 03:00.721
Last one.

03:00.756 --> 03:02.723
I promise.

03:23.779 --> 03:25.146
Get dressed.

03:39.194 --> 03:42.263
(beeping)

03:44.733 --> 03:46.867
(beeping continues)

04:00.882 --> 04:02.183
CSI finished upstairs?

04:02.217 --> 04:03.484
Shouldn't be long, sir.

04:03.518 --> 04:04.685
You're a bot.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.187
Yes, I am.

04:06.221 --> 04:08.222
Cool! What can you do?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.561
Whoa.
Oh, awesome!

04:14.896 --> 04:16.564
Are you a robot, too?

04:16.598 --> 04:17.898
No, I'm human.

04:17.933 --> 04:20.101
Oh. What can you do?

04:29.277 --> 04:31.312
Watch this.

04:33.682 --> 04:36.217
(screams) No, no, no.

04:36.251 --> 04:38.819
It doesn't hurt. I got...
I got a synthetic leg!

04:46.495 --> 04:49.063
I haven't even been a child,
and I know that would scare one.

04:49.097 --> 04:50.664
What's the matter with you?

04:50.699 --> 04:52.666
You have negative energy, man.

04:52.701 --> 04:54.635
My energy's great.
Why don't you

04:54.669 --> 04:56.203
like kids? I never said
I don't like kids.

04:56.238 --> 04:57.872
You said I don't like kids.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.975
Children can sense
electromagnetic fields, John.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.244
That's a bunch of baloney. They
can sense discomfort, frustration

05:03.278 --> 05:04.879
and bad energy.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.147
As do felines.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.549
I bet you have an issue
with cats, too, am I right?

05:08.583 --> 05:10.885
Hey. My issue with cats
is none of your business.

05:10.919 --> 05:13.053
(elevator chimes)

05:17.826 --> 05:20.227
I'm allergic to cats.

05:20.262 --> 05:22.329
Maybe the cats are
allergic to you.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.465
You ever consider that?

05:28.637 --> 05:30.538
(beep)

05:30.572 --> 05:32.773
Victim is ID'd
as Sebastian Jones.

05:32.808 --> 05:34.842
He paid for the room with cash.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.677
Front desk said he showed up

05:36.711 --> 05:38.679
with a woman.
Red hair, 20s.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.282
About a half hour later,
two men showed up.

05:41.316 --> 05:42.650
There are no fingerprints.

05:42.684 --> 05:44.885
I don't think we're gonna
get anything from Forensics.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.954
Everything is tainted in here.

05:46.988 --> 05:49.957
They used a DNA bomb.

05:49.991 --> 05:52.426
I hate that stuff.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.335
Absorption round, third gen.

06:01.369 --> 06:04.472
Wouldn't have made a sound.
These guys are good.

06:04.506 --> 06:06.540
Any surveillance?

06:12.080 --> 06:15.282
DORIAN:
She came in at 6:15 p.m.

06:15.317 --> 06:18.085
They arrived 20 minutes later.

06:18.119 --> 06:20.754
They're wearing FlashMask.

06:22.457 --> 06:24.758
They took his bag.

06:37.572 --> 06:39.006
John.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.775
She's an android.

06:46.982 --> 06:49.083
MALDONADO:
What do we have on our victim?

06:49.117 --> 06:52.753
Sebastian Jones was
a high-end sex trade bot-maker.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.121
Yeah, too bad he's dead.

06:54.155 --> 06:55.523
Could've made you a girlfriend.

06:55.557 --> 06:57.725
I'm not the one
with the online dating profile.

06:57.759 --> 07:00.494
I don't have
an online dating profile.

07:00.529 --> 07:03.163
You do now.

07:03.198 --> 07:04.565
"Capricorn

07:04.599 --> 07:06.133
who loves danger."

07:06.167 --> 07:08.736
Okay. While you're at it,
why don't you put down.

07:08.770 --> 07:12.239
"Recently lost partner
in tragic freeway accident."

07:12.274 --> 07:13.407
MALDONADO:
Guys, what do we have?

07:13.441 --> 07:14.909
DORIAN:
Sebastian Jones' company

07:14.943 --> 07:16.644
is called Orillian Sapients.

07:16.678 --> 07:18.078
They specialize in advanced

07:18.113 --> 07:19.847
- sexual robotics. - MALDONADO:
Is this one of his sexbots?

07:19.881 --> 07:21.515
JOHN:
We don't know.

07:21.550 --> 07:22.917
Sexbots are licensed.

07:22.951 --> 07:23.872
Who's it registered to?

07:23.885 --> 07:25.386
It's not registered to anybody.

07:25.420 --> 07:26.320
Someone owns it.

07:26.354 --> 07:27.454
It has to be registered.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.989
What else do we know
about his life?

07:29.024 --> 07:30.357
No spouse, no kids,

07:30.392 --> 07:31.458
no criminal record.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.227
Legitimate businessman.

07:33.261 --> 07:34.862
- Inventor. - DORIAN:
He has 23 patents

07:34.896 --> 07:37.464
to his name and is credited
as a pioneer in developing

07:37.499 --> 07:40.134
the artificial blush response. PAUL:
Every red-blooded man in this city

07:40.168 --> 07:42.136
owes a debt
to this fallen genius.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.038
Why, because he makes
sex trade bots?

07:44.072 --> 07:46.273
Call 'em "bang bots."
They actually like it.

07:46.308 --> 07:47.875
And you know this
from experience?

07:47.909 --> 07:49.643
PAUL (chuckles):
You say it like it's

07:49.678 --> 07:51.612
a bad thing. Crimes in
the sex trade are down

07:51.646 --> 07:53.747
38% since the bots were introduced.
PAUL: Right?

07:53.782 --> 07:54.848
Do that math.
The fewer real women

07:54.883 --> 07:56.323
that have to sleep with you,
Richard,

07:56.351 --> 07:58.218
the better off the world is.
Okay.

07:58.253 --> 08:00.094
What else do we know about him?
Sebastian Jones

08:00.121 --> 08:01.522
couldn't pay his bills.

08:01.556 --> 08:04.625
Orillian Sapients declared
bankruptcy three months ago.

08:04.659 --> 08:06.894
<i>Creditors seized
all of his assets,</i>

08:06.928 --> 08:08.495
<i>and now
they're currently sitting</i>

08:08.530 --> 08:10.698
<i>in a repo storage facility.</i>

08:27.482 --> 08:30.217
(soft buzzing)

08:41.730 --> 08:43.864
DORIAN:
Found a court summons.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.634
- Sebastian was being sued.
- (phone rings)

08:46.668 --> 08:48.302
Kennex.

08:48.336 --> 08:49.703
Your case just got weird.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.872
I just sent you something.
You get it?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.341
Yeah, I got it.

08:54.376 --> 08:56.744
The CSis went through
the elevator at the hotel,

08:56.778 --> 08:58.112
scanning spots these guys

08:58.146 --> 09:00.414
likely touched, trying
to pick up some DNA on them.

09:00.448 --> 09:02.916
Yeah. We didn't find
any DNA on the guys,

09:02.951 --> 09:04.618
but we found something else.

09:04.653 --> 09:09.223
That's the first sample
they pulled.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.026
Everywhere she touched, there
was DNA from a 25-year-old girl

09:12.060 --> 09:14.695
named Nicole Bloomquist,
who was abducted three weeks ago

09:14.729 --> 09:15.929
from a parking garage.

09:15.964 --> 09:17.765
Are you telling me
the sexbot we're looking for

09:17.799 --> 09:19.433
is leaving this girl's DNA?

09:19.467 --> 09:20.934
It seems that way.

09:20.969 --> 09:22.269
How?

09:22.303 --> 09:24.571
Correct. How?

09:29.944 --> 09:31.845
(slurping) Ah, there you go.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.447
Perfect, perfect.

09:33.481 --> 09:35.549
Oh, look at you.
Wriggle monster.

09:35.583 --> 09:36.884
(giggles) Okay.

09:36.918 --> 09:38.052
Mommy'll take it then.

09:38.086 --> 09:39.186
Give me your hands,

09:39.220 --> 09:40.354
give me your face.

09:40.388 --> 09:41.522
Beautiful.

09:41.556 --> 09:44.058
(vehicle approaching)

09:44.092 --> 09:46.326
(tires screech)

09:47.996 --> 09:49.630
(grunting)

09:49.664 --> 09:51.465
(whirring)

09:53.134 --> 09:54.334
(grunts)

09:57.539 --> 09:59.640
(tires screech)

10:08.117 --> 10:09.818
(siren chirping in distance)

10:09.852 --> 10:11.787
<i>VALERIE:
Another abduction happened.</i>

10:11.821 --> 10:13.255
Same M.O.
as Nicole Bloomquist.

10:13.289 --> 10:15.224
20-something female,
parking structure.

10:15.258 --> 10:16.592
Cameras were disabled.

10:16.626 --> 10:18.393
There's no surveillance
of the abduction.

10:18.428 --> 10:20.262
And I found three more
missing persons cases

10:20.296 --> 10:21.663
with the same pattern.

10:21.698 --> 10:23.599
So, they kill the cams
and then take the women.

10:23.633 --> 10:27.135
Yeah, except this time,
something was left behind.

10:32.475 --> 10:35.611
He was in the car.
His name is Victor.

10:35.645 --> 10:37.512
Can I talk to him?

10:37.547 --> 10:38.513
Maybe I should talk to him.

10:38.548 --> 10:40.816
He's not good with kids. Hey.

10:40.850 --> 10:42.150
Or cats.
That-That's not...

10:42.185 --> 10:44.953
I'm great with kids, really.

10:59.335 --> 11:01.436
(sighs)

11:02.772 --> 11:03.939
Hey.

11:06.209 --> 11:07.809
I'm Detective Kennex.

11:07.844 --> 11:10.312
You must be, uh, Victor, right?

11:11.948 --> 11:13.749
Victor's a-a good name.

11:13.783 --> 11:15.083
It's a good, strong name.

11:17.687 --> 11:19.488
Look, I know
this must be hard...

11:19.522 --> 11:22.457
but I need you to be brave.

11:22.492 --> 11:23.692
Okay?

11:23.726 --> 11:26.028
I really need you to tell me
what happened with your mom.

11:47.717 --> 11:50.552
(giraffe squeaking)

11:52.055 --> 11:53.288
You like him?

11:55.291 --> 11:57.225
I'll give him to you
if you want him.

11:57.260 --> 11:59.394
But you got to promise me

11:59.429 --> 12:00.595
to look after him

12:00.630 --> 12:03.565
because he means a lot to me.

12:03.599 --> 12:06.501
- I promise.
- You promise?

12:06.536 --> 12:08.870
Okay.

12:08.905 --> 12:11.006
I trust you.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.408
Look, Victor.

12:13.443 --> 12:15.644
But I really need your help.

12:15.678 --> 12:17.913
Need you to tell me
what happened with your mom.

12:17.947 --> 12:20.982
You guys were in a car, right?

12:21.017 --> 12:22.751
Your mom got out.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.353
She went to put the trash away.

12:24.387 --> 12:27.456
Then what happened?

12:27.490 --> 12:29.091
(sighs)

12:29.125 --> 12:30.992
I saw the car.

12:31.027 --> 12:32.661
Did you see who was in it?

12:32.695 --> 12:34.596
Two men.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.598
Two men?

12:36.632 --> 12:38.133
What happened then?

12:38.167 --> 12:40.135
The car drove away.

12:40.169 --> 12:43.839
What kind of car was it?
What color?

12:43.873 --> 12:47.042
It was a big, silver car.

12:47.076 --> 12:51.012
A big, silver car.

12:54.384 --> 12:56.785
That's good.

12:59.389 --> 13:02.724
When is my mom coming?

13:11.467 --> 13:13.702
Hey, Victor.

13:13.736 --> 13:17.172
You did really good.

13:18.178 --> 13:21.021
- What's up? - CSI found the
silver sedan on a traffic cam

13:21.043 --> 13:22.911
a block from
the parking structure.

13:22.945 --> 13:25.614
The license plates
tracked back to a red SUV.

13:25.648 --> 13:26.848
They're using stolen plates.

13:26.883 --> 13:28.417
We got every plate scanner
in the city

13:28.451 --> 13:29.384
looking for those tags.

13:29.419 --> 13:30.786
We'll find that car.

13:32.121 --> 13:35.023
Okay, two girls were abducted
with the same M.O.

13:35.057 --> 13:36.558
and one of them,

13:36.592 --> 13:38.059
her DNA was found on the sexbot

13:38.094 --> 13:39.828
who was with Sebastian Jones
when he was murdered.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.062
I think we should
focus on finding

13:41.097 --> 13:42.597
the sexbot that was
with Sebastian.

13:42.632 --> 13:44.332
DORIAN: If we can access
her memory, we might be able

13:44.367 --> 13:45.834
to see what happened
in the hotel that night.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.302
And identify who did it.

13:47.336 --> 13:49.938
That's our best bet
for finding the missing women.

13:49.972 --> 13:51.072
Guys, I might have a new angle.

13:51.107 --> 13:52.908
I dug into
those summonses you found.

13:52.942 --> 13:54.576
Sebastian's former business
partner Lorenzo Shaw

13:54.610 --> 13:58.213
was suing him for intellectual
property infringement

13:58.247 --> 14:00.015
and he just opened a
sexbot showroom downtown

14:00.049 --> 14:01.089
for himself... it's motive.

14:01.117 --> 14:02.350
He could be involved.

14:02.385 --> 14:04.119
Check him out.

14:07.356 --> 14:09.558
You were surprisingly good
with that kid back there, John.

14:09.592 --> 14:12.961
Even though you had
to bribe him with a giraffe.

14:12.995 --> 14:15.030
Thanks.

14:15.064 --> 14:16.731
Do you think his mother
is still alive?

14:16.766 --> 14:18.533
I hope so.

14:18.568 --> 14:20.602
Every hour she's gone
diminishes the chance

14:20.636 --> 14:23.371
of us finding her alive.

14:26.709 --> 14:30.045
What do you tell a small child
when someone dies?

14:31.914 --> 14:33.248
I've never considered that.

14:33.282 --> 14:35.217
What you would tell
a small child.

14:35.251 --> 14:37.552
Well, you say the same thing
that you'd say to an adult.

14:37.587 --> 14:39.120
What do they say?

14:39.155 --> 14:40.689
You tell them
that the person that died

14:40.723 --> 14:43.592
has gone to a better place.

14:43.626 --> 14:45.386
Why would anyone say that
when there's no way

14:45.394 --> 14:48.196
to really know where living
things go when they stop living?

14:50.299 --> 14:52.767
It's designed to give hope
and comfort.

14:52.802 --> 14:56.705
To ease the pain.

14:56.739 --> 14:59.908
People believe it
because they need to.

15:01.043 --> 15:03.378
Hmm, the data
I've studied suggests

15:03.412 --> 15:05.747
that the best proof
of one's existence

15:05.781 --> 15:08.250
is if one is remembered
after they're gone.

15:11.454 --> 15:12.787
Was your partner's son told
that his father

15:12.822 --> 15:14.556
went to a better place?

15:14.590 --> 15:17.292
I don't know.

15:19.595 --> 15:22.297
You never spoke
to your partner's son?

15:23.566 --> 15:27.035
I can understand why
that would be hard for you.

15:33.709 --> 15:36.077
(rapid breathing)

15:38.548 --> 15:40.715
(low sobbing)

15:51.027 --> 15:53.495
What did you do with my son?

15:53.529 --> 15:56.331
Don't worry.

15:56.365 --> 15:57.832
The authorities will have him

15:57.867 --> 15:59.434
by now.

15:59.468 --> 16:00.635
You see, we're...

16:00.670 --> 16:01.870
we're not monsters.
I have money!

16:01.904 --> 16:03.371
Anything you want, anything.

16:03.406 --> 16:04.539
I'll give you anything.

16:04.574 --> 16:06.908
Please, I just want to see my son...
(shushes)

16:06.943 --> 16:09.511
I already have

16:09.545 --> 16:11.079
what I want.

16:12.214 --> 16:13.615
No, no, no!

16:13.649 --> 16:15.016
(crying)

16:17.003 --> 16:18.037
JOHN:
Your ex-partner,

16:18.071 --> 16:19.872
Sebastian Jones,

16:19.906 --> 16:21.607
when was the last time
you saw him?

16:21.641 --> 16:23.809
Six months? Seven?

16:23.843 --> 16:26.445
We'd been sort of
on the outs lately.

16:26.479 --> 16:27.413
"On the outs"?

16:27.447 --> 16:28.647
You were suing him.

16:28.682 --> 16:30.449
I have intellectual
property rights

16:30.483 --> 16:31.650
on designs
we developed together

16:31.685 --> 16:32.751
at Orillian.

16:32.786 --> 16:33.986
What happens to the I.P. rights

16:34.020 --> 16:36.021
now that Sebastian's naked?

16:37.791 --> 16:39.024
Um, I mean "dead."

16:39.059 --> 16:40.226
Now that Sebastian's dead.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.260
What happens
to the I.P. rights?

16:41.294 --> 16:44.530
Well, they would
naturally revert to me.

16:49.636 --> 16:52.104
Is this one of your models?

16:52.138 --> 16:54.506
No, she's not mine.

16:54.541 --> 16:56.175
What about this one?

16:57.477 --> 16:58.877
Or this one?

16:58.912 --> 17:00.846
You ever seen
these women before?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.014
No, but they're not synthetics.

17:02.048 --> 17:03.983
How can you be sure?
In my line of work,

17:04.017 --> 17:06.752
you get to know.

17:06.786 --> 17:09.255
You know, I haven't seen
one of you in a while.

17:09.289 --> 17:12.324
The latest sexbots have a little
bit of your old tech in them.

17:12.358 --> 17:13.358
They're capable

17:13.393 --> 17:14.693
of bonding empathetically

17:14.728 --> 17:16.161
with their clients.

17:16.195 --> 17:17.829
Sense their moods...

17:17.864 --> 17:20.098
and respond accordingly.

17:20.133 --> 17:22.166
It's a significant achievement.

17:22.202 --> 17:23.902
If your bots are so special,

17:23.936 --> 17:25.704
why was Sebastian so in debt?

17:25.739 --> 17:27.740
Well, if you knew Sebastian,
you'd understand.

17:27.773 --> 17:29.441
He was an artist.

17:29.476 --> 17:30.743
We were making good money.

17:30.777 --> 17:32.811
But he was determined
to create the next line.

17:32.846 --> 17:33.979
Better than the last.

17:34.014 --> 17:36.315
He sunk all our capital
into new fabs,

17:36.349 --> 17:38.217
tooling, subsystems.

17:38.251 --> 17:40.019
He bet the whole company on it.

17:40.053 --> 17:41.820
And then our biggest
client canceled

17:41.855 --> 17:43.222
their contract with us.

17:43.256 --> 17:44.823
Took us completely by surprise.

17:44.858 --> 17:46.125
Bankrupted us.

17:46.159 --> 17:48.093
Who was your biggest client?

17:49.396 --> 17:52.464
Ah, if you don't want
to tell me, that's okay.

17:52.499 --> 17:53.699
We'll just subpoena
your records.

17:53.733 --> 17:55.134
Shut you down for a few days

17:55.168 --> 17:56.769
while we go through them.

17:59.773 --> 18:01.607
It was an Albanian consortium.

18:01.641 --> 18:03.542
They said they were
cutting out the middle man.

18:03.576 --> 18:05.077
You mean they found
a new supplier?

18:05.111 --> 18:06.245
Apparently.

18:06.279 --> 18:08.614
Sebastian couldn't believe
that anyone could build

18:08.648 --> 18:10.249
a better sexbot than us.

18:10.283 --> 18:11.750
The first picture I showed you.

18:11.785 --> 18:13.819
Did she belong to the Albanians?

18:13.853 --> 18:17.156
Is she why Sebastian was at the
hotel the night he was killed?

18:17.190 --> 18:19.658
(door opens)

18:19.693 --> 18:21.493
I wouldn't know.

18:21.528 --> 18:23.562
Look, I-I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

18:23.596 --> 18:25.397
Did they threaten you?

18:25.432 --> 18:27.499
No...

18:27.534 --> 18:28.734
They were good clients.

18:28.768 --> 18:29.835
They always paid on time.

18:29.869 --> 18:32.237
And that's all
I'm gonna say about them.

18:32.272 --> 18:33.505
Excuse me.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.573
I have customers.

18:34.607 --> 18:36.275
Mr. Shaw?

18:36.309 --> 18:37.643
Have you ever heard of people

18:37.677 --> 18:40.546
incorporating human
DNA into a sexbot?

18:41.948 --> 18:43.816
That's illegal.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.552
And I think you know that.

18:51.224 --> 18:53.525
(sexbot giggles)

18:53.560 --> 18:57.129
You can say you don't
like robots all you want.

18:57.163 --> 19:00.432
Your pulse says otherwise.

19:00.467 --> 19:02.034
What?

19:02.068 --> 19:04.370
Precisely.

19:04.404 --> 19:07.606
I want you to hack
into Shaw's customer network.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.242
Find the Albanians.

19:10.276 --> 19:11.610
We don't need a warrant?

19:11.644 --> 19:12.978
I agree.

19:19.386 --> 19:20.786
Got it.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.621
Five star rating.

19:22.655 --> 19:25.758
What's the plan?

19:25.792 --> 19:27.893
Stir the pot.

19:50.483 --> 19:52.785
(speaking Albanian)

20:03.730 --> 20:05.063
Hands out of your pockets.

20:05.098 --> 20:07.499
You seen this bot?
No.

20:07.534 --> 20:08.834
No?

20:08.868 --> 20:10.569
Seen that bot?
No, no...

20:13.406 --> 20:14.540
We tested all the bots.

20:14.574 --> 20:16.408
They all check out.
They're clean.

20:16.443 --> 20:18.410
Okay, thanks.

20:18.445 --> 20:19.745
Yup.

20:24.417 --> 20:26.985
Officers.

20:27.020 --> 20:28.787
I'm the manager.

20:28.822 --> 20:30.956
Can I help you?

20:30.990 --> 20:32.724
Is this one of your bots?

20:32.759 --> 20:34.726
No.

20:34.761 --> 20:36.395
We got a great selection here.

20:36.429 --> 20:37.990
We can get you
pretty close to this one.

20:37.997 --> 20:40.866
Our bots have passed
all the required tests.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.367
Special rate for cops.

20:42.402 --> 20:43.702
We love ps.

20:43.736 --> 20:44.736
Yeah.

20:44.771 --> 20:46.305
We love cops.
Well, great.

20:46.339 --> 20:48.140
If you answer all
of my questions,

20:48.174 --> 20:51.643
maybe I'll let you
get to first base.

20:52.979 --> 20:54.413
You ever buy

20:54.447 --> 20:56.148
from Sebastian Jones
and Lorenzo Shaw?

20:56.182 --> 20:57.149
We used to.

20:57.183 --> 20:59.017
Not anymore.
Why'd you stop?

20:59.052 --> 21:00.853
We make our own now.

21:00.887 --> 21:02.521
And you're sure that's
not one of them?

21:02.555 --> 21:04.923
Already said.

21:04.958 --> 21:06.492
DORIAN: John.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.994
Detective Stahl needs
to talk to us.

21:11.764 --> 21:13.332
Thank you, gentlemen.

21:17.337 --> 21:19.471
His vitals suggest
that he is lying.

21:19.506 --> 21:20.372
Yup.

21:20.406 --> 21:22.841
Or he doesn't like
you very much.

21:22.876 --> 21:26.178
Add him to the list
of kids and cats.

21:29.015 --> 21:31.250
We got a hit
for the silver sedan.

21:31.284 --> 21:33.986
The one that kidnapped Kristen
Haseman in the parking garage.

21:34.020 --> 21:36.188
We picked it up
on a plate scanner.

21:36.222 --> 21:38.290
Dorian, watch the sedan
as it goes

21:38.324 --> 21:40.092
past the scanner.

21:43.763 --> 21:46.298
The license plate changes.

21:46.332 --> 21:48.066
They're using a tag scrambler.

21:48.101 --> 21:49.468
Once we realized that,
we switched

21:49.502 --> 21:51.069
to straight surveillance cams
and tracked it

21:51.104 --> 21:53.939
to an industrial facility
off 8th Street.

21:53.973 --> 21:55.574
JOHN:
What were they doing there?

21:55.608 --> 21:57.309
I don't know,
they were there for 20 minutes,

21:57.343 --> 21:58.977
and then we lost 'em.

21:59.012 --> 22:01.113
All right, we're
three minutes out.

22:01.147 --> 22:03.715
(tires screeching)

22:19.632 --> 22:21.567
What the hell is that?

22:21.601 --> 22:24.036
Is that Kristen Haseman?

22:24.070 --> 22:25.437
It's not human.

22:32.412 --> 22:34.613
This is the android
from the hotel.

22:38.084 --> 22:40.986
If this is what they're
doing to their sexbots,

22:41.020 --> 22:44.122
imagine what they're doing
to the women they've abducted.

22:50.675 --> 22:53.277
RUDY:
Beautiful green.

22:53.311 --> 22:56.280
They really have got
the color just right.

22:56.314 --> 22:58.082
You see, these
shots were targeted

22:58.116 --> 22:59.950
precisely to shatter
the cortical relays

22:59.985 --> 23:01.418
and storage centers.

23:01.453 --> 23:02.653
They destroyed her memory.

23:02.687 --> 23:05.122
Yeah, they wanted to ensure
no one could retrieve

23:05.157 --> 23:08.159
her recorded memories of
Sebastian Jones' murder.

23:08.193 --> 23:10.227
These albinos knew exactly
what they were doing.

23:10.262 --> 23:11.328
Albanians.

23:11.363 --> 23:13.697
Well, that, that
would make more sense.

23:13.732 --> 23:15.699
But there is a small
chance that her

23:15.734 --> 23:17.434
temporal housing
might be intact enough

23:17.469 --> 23:19.770
to salvage some of
her echoic memory.

23:19.805 --> 23:21.705
Uh, she might still
be able to tell us

23:21.740 --> 23:23.707
something about the
people that did this.

23:23.742 --> 23:25.176
(grunts)

23:25.210 --> 23:26.744
Apologies, mate.

23:26.778 --> 23:28.412
I'm used to being
alone when I do this.

23:28.446 --> 23:29.527
You might want to look away.

23:29.548 --> 23:31.682
It's fine.

23:33.718 --> 23:36.220
Why did they peel its skin off?

23:36.254 --> 23:38.422
Well, they obviously didn't want
us to see that either.

23:38.456 --> 23:39.957
Wait a minute,

23:39.991 --> 23:41.525
the surveillance footage
at the hotel.

23:41.560 --> 23:43.527
Her hands left traces
of human DNA.

23:43.562 --> 23:45.162
You think they're
abducting the girls

23:45.197 --> 23:46.497
to harvest their skin.

23:46.531 --> 23:48.399
If you used human skin,

23:48.433 --> 23:50.935
you'd make the best sex machines
on the market.

23:50.969 --> 23:52.369
I think Sebastian
found out about it.

23:52.404 --> 23:53.504
That's why they killed him.

23:53.538 --> 23:55.506
Sex machine, bang bot?

23:55.540 --> 23:57.141
It's a bit myopic, isn't it?

23:57.175 --> 23:59.009
Not everyone who visits a
sexbot is looking for sex.

23:59.044 --> 24:01.212
Some people go for
the conversation

24:01.246 --> 24:04.348
or for a sympathetic ear at
the end of a long working day

24:04.382 --> 24:06.217
surrounded by people who
only ever come to visit

24:06.251 --> 24:07.852
when they want
something from you.

24:12.858 --> 24:16.360
I'm just saying that, uh,

24:16.394 --> 24:18.963
the neural interface is
quite sophisticated.

24:18.997 --> 24:20.998
Anyway, it appears

24:21.032 --> 24:23.567
they're growing skin using
DNA from the abducted women.

24:23.602 --> 24:25.369
Well, synthetic skin,

24:25.403 --> 24:27.938
as good as it is, is
a long way from the real thing.

24:27.973 --> 24:30.074
There are pheromones and
other biological features

24:30.108 --> 24:32.276
that trigger attraction.

24:35.013 --> 24:36.714
Here it is.
(whirring)

24:40.952 --> 24:42.887
(sighs)

24:42.921 --> 24:44.922
Sorry, it's too damaged.

24:44.956 --> 24:46.056
If you want to know

24:46.091 --> 24:47.491
where these bots are
coming from, I'm going

24:47.525 --> 24:50.494
to have to get my hands
on a live one.

24:50.528 --> 24:52.663
So to speak.

25:01.640 --> 25:02.806
You're quiet.

25:02.841 --> 25:04.975
What's wrong?

25:06.711 --> 25:10.114
Just looking at that bot
on Rudy's table

25:10.148 --> 25:13.817
makes me think,

25:13.852 --> 25:16.253
who is going to remember me?

25:20.158 --> 25:22.793
You're a cop.

25:22.827 --> 25:24.962
The people you help
will remember you,

25:24.996 --> 25:27.698
whatever your name is.

25:31.303 --> 25:32.836
Speaking of names,
someone just responded

25:32.871 --> 25:33.938
to your dating profile, John.

25:33.972 --> 25:35.172
My dating pro...

25:35.206 --> 25:36.640
I thought you were kidding.

25:36.675 --> 25:39.543
Not kidding... I saw the way you
were looking at those sexbots.

25:39.577 --> 25:41.111
Your profile name is...

25:41.146 --> 25:42.913
(in French accent):
Dr. Richard.

25:42.948 --> 25:44.415
Dr. Richard.
Who likes quiche,

25:44.449 --> 25:46.317
long walks on the beach, smooth jazz.
You seriously did not

25:46.351 --> 25:47.751
call me Dr. Richard.

25:47.786 --> 25:49.153
I thought you wanted to meet someone.
I meet

25:49.187 --> 25:50.354
plenty of women.
I don't need your help.

25:50.388 --> 25:53.590
I-I ran a bio scan, and it
looked like your testicles were

25:53.625 --> 25:54.591
at full capacity.

25:54.626 --> 25:55.759
You're scanning my balls?

25:55.794 --> 25:56.593
I didn't enjoy it,

25:56.628 --> 25:57.795
I just...
Oh, my God,

25:57.829 --> 25:59.430
this is unbelievable.
I can't help but notice

25:59.464 --> 26:00.698
you're backed up.

26:00.732 --> 26:02.933
What is the matter with you?

26:08.673 --> 26:12.176
Don't scan my
testicles ever again.

26:12.210 --> 26:13.711
Copy that.

26:20.585 --> 26:22.720
What does she look like?

26:23.822 --> 26:25.856
What do you want her
to look like?

26:25.890 --> 26:28.826
Brown eyes, soulful.

26:28.860 --> 26:30.427
Height?

26:30.462 --> 26:32.062
Average height.

26:32.097 --> 26:34.231
I like brunettes.

26:34.265 --> 26:35.833
Would you date anyone
in your profession

26:35.867 --> 26:38.602
or would you prefer to date
someone outside of it?

26:38.636 --> 26:41.138
Sure, either way.

26:41.172 --> 26:45.843
I like smart women, you know,
women that are smarter than me.

26:45.877 --> 26:47.411
That won't be hard.

26:49.514 --> 26:51.782
You are aware
that you just described.

26:51.816 --> 26:54.351
Detective Stahl, right?

26:56.588 --> 26:58.255
(phone rings)

26:58.289 --> 27:00.524
Kennex.

27:00.558 --> 27:02.826
Hey, we got a 20
on the silver sedan you posted.

27:02.861 --> 27:04.762
I just uploaded it to Dorian.

27:04.796 --> 27:07.431
Uh, okay, thank you, um,

27:07.465 --> 27:10.200
Detective Stahl, thanks.

27:10.235 --> 27:13.437
(mimicking): Okay, thank you,
Detective Stahl. Shut up.

27:13.471 --> 27:16.206
Shut it, zip it.

27:22.981 --> 27:25.182
Police!

27:25.216 --> 27:27.684
Hands up! Hands on the dash! Don't you move!
Put your hands on the dashboard!

27:27.719 --> 27:30.721
- Hold 'em, keep 'em there! - Do not move!
Put your hands on the dashboard now

27:30.755 --> 27:32.489
- where I can see 'em!
- Turn around, turn around!

27:32.524 --> 27:33.757
Step out of the car.

27:33.792 --> 27:34.992
Come on.

27:35.026 --> 27:36.760
Around front.

27:52.444 --> 27:55.212
Hi, I'm Vanessa.

27:55.246 --> 27:57.281
Hey, how you doing?
DORIAN: I need to take

27:57.315 --> 27:58.549
a DNA sample.

27:58.583 --> 28:00.517
Open your mouth, please.

28:00.552 --> 28:01.518
Why?

28:01.553 --> 28:03.620
I've passed all my tests.

28:03.655 --> 28:05.255
Please.

28:24.509 --> 28:26.643
Her DNA belongs
to a Lorraine White,

28:26.678 --> 28:28.245
abducted
from a parking structure

28:28.279 --> 28:30.314
two months ago in St. Clair.

28:37.422 --> 28:38.555
JOHN:
Rudy,

28:38.590 --> 28:40.858
found you some skin.

29:09.420 --> 29:10.787
(gasps)

29:19.740 --> 29:22.475
The Albanians aren't telling us

29:22.510 --> 29:24.110
where the kidnap victims are.

29:24.145 --> 29:27.314
We need to get that
information from a sexbot.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.082
We have three missing
girls out there

29:29.116 --> 29:31.084
somewhere, maybe more.

29:31.118 --> 29:32.719
I'll pull everything
I can from it.

29:41.829 --> 29:43.930
Hello again.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.168
A human's DNA was used

29:48.202 --> 29:51.104
to make your skin.

29:51.138 --> 29:53.073
This woman.

29:53.107 --> 29:54.908
We need to find her.

29:54.942 --> 29:55.902
We don't have much time.

29:55.910 --> 29:57.644
Have you seen her before?

29:59.146 --> 30:00.680
No.

30:00.715 --> 30:02.015
I need you to think.

30:02.049 --> 30:04.484
It's really important.

30:04.518 --> 30:06.586
Have you seen her?

30:06.621 --> 30:08.421
No.

30:08.456 --> 30:10.156
Where were you made?

30:11.993 --> 30:13.727
Who owns you?

30:16.364 --> 30:18.498
Do you know where you were born?

30:24.972 --> 30:27.741
You ever worked with this girl?

30:31.512 --> 30:32.812
Charlene.

30:32.847 --> 30:34.314
Right, Charlene.

30:34.348 --> 30:37.651
Do you know where she was born?

30:39.553 --> 30:40.987
Who owns you?

30:42.890 --> 30:44.858
DORIAN:
She's probably not conscious

30:44.892 --> 30:47.127
of those terms.

30:50.498 --> 30:53.133
Where were those men
taking you tonight?

30:53.167 --> 30:54.567
They were taking me for a ride.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.803
We think they were taking
you to be destroyed.

30:56.837 --> 30:58.972
Why would anybody want
to destroy me?

30:59.006 --> 31:03.309
There are much, much better
things to do with me.

31:03.344 --> 31:07.147
We don't have to do anything
if you don't want to.

31:07.181 --> 31:10.850
I'm a very, very good listener.

31:10.885 --> 31:14.521
You know, people look for
connections in different ways.

31:14.555 --> 31:16.690
That's all people
are looking for,

31:16.724 --> 31:19.859
is someone who cares
about them.

31:19.894 --> 31:22.062
That's what I'm here for.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.300
Do you know where Charlene is?

31:28.602 --> 31:29.936
Yes.

31:29.970 --> 31:31.705
Can I see her?

31:31.739 --> 31:34.340
Why do you want to?

31:37.445 --> 31:38.678
I don't know.

31:38.713 --> 31:39.679
You were designed

31:39.714 --> 31:41.314
to bond with people.

31:41.348 --> 31:44.050
That's what you were
developed to do.

31:45.319 --> 31:47.253
To notice when they're there.

31:49.423 --> 31:51.791
That also means you notice
when they're not there.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.360
That's why you want to see her.

31:54.395 --> 31:56.529
That's what you're feeling.

31:58.332 --> 31:59.999
Who told you

32:00.034 --> 32:04.804
to go with the men
we found you with tonight?

32:04.839 --> 32:06.005
Yuri.

32:07.475 --> 32:09.576

- DORIAN (over radio): Rudy?
- Yes, Dorian?

34:01.557 --> 34:03.225
Most of these sexbots
are platformed

34:03.259 --> 34:05.894
on an old UJuno
Pendant Learning Module.

34:05.928 --> 34:08.397
Uh, yeah, uh, those modules
were available

34:08.431 --> 34:11.833
to the public sector once we
stopped using them on the DRNs.

34:11.868 --> 34:13.235
Problem was that
they were giving off

34:13.268 --> 34:14.202
an unwanted GPS signal.

34:14.237 --> 34:15.203
Yeah, it was

34:15.237 --> 34:16.438
an unwanted side effect.

34:16.472 --> 34:19.306
Um, whenever they, uh,
automatically updated

34:19.342 --> 34:22.143
their software,
they'd inadvertently send out

34:22.178 --> 34:25.147
a signal allowing
those so inclined to, uh,

34:25.181 --> 34:26.214
track you.

34:26.248 --> 34:27.681
Is there a log of that?

34:27.717 --> 34:29.384
I'm sure there is.

34:29.418 --> 34:31.253
Can you access
Vanessa's internal GPS log

34:31.286 --> 34:34.790
to find the very first time
that the module sent a signal?

34:34.824 --> 34:36.658
If we can find out
It's possible.

34:36.692 --> 34:38.159

she was activated,

34:38.194 --> 34:40.862
