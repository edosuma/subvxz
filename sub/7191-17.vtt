00:01.835 --> 00:03.878
- They're mad at me again?

00:03.961 --> 00:05.588
- I think they're planning
to overthrow you.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.632
- Overthrow me?

00:07.716 --> 00:09.008
What does that mean?

00:09.092 --> 00:10.093
- It means to remove you--

00:10.176 --> 00:11.928
- I know what "overthrow" means.

00:12.011 --> 00:13.972
I meant in regards to me.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.099
They--they can't
overthrow me.

00:16.181 --> 00:19.144
- Yeah, she's right,
we'll fight it.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.646
- I mean, I'm not president
or queen of anything.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.064
- Yeah, but you are
the Chosen One.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.942
- Agamemnon said that the
council is worried about you.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.610
And they're not afraid to
neutralize you

00:27.694 --> 00:28.820
like they did to the principal.

00:28.903 --> 00:30.905
- <i>They</i> neutralized
the principal?

00:30.989 --> 00:31.781
Yeah, right, we did that.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.658
You have
nothing to worry about.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.951
- Yes, you do.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.369
They're waiting for
one more slip up

00:36.453 --> 00:38.163
so that Lily can be
on their side and then...

00:38.246 --> 00:39.873
- Then what?

00:39.956 --> 00:42.500
- And then no more Chosen One.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.170
- It's probably just Agamemnon
trying to scare me.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.463
- I don't think so.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.797
They didn't believe you
when you said that

00:47.881 --> 00:49.924
you'd get rid of Phillip.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.135
- Huh?

00:52.218 --> 00:53.595
Phillip.
- Ha!

00:53.678 --> 00:55.513
'Cause she's not.
- Andi!

00:55.597 --> 00:57.515
- Emma, I like Phillip
just as much as you do,

00:57.599 --> 00:59.893
but we can't go around
altering reality.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.520

whatever you came to say.

I only let you in because you
played the Panther card...

01:58.952 --> 02:00.078
and you have keys.

02:00.161 --> 02:00.954
- Thanks for
hearing me out.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.039
- Two minutes.
Go.

to be friends again.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.835
I miss being a Panther
and I miss you.

02:06.918 --> 02:10.420
I was only friends with Mia
to get information out of her.

I didn't get much,

02:12.382 --> 02:15.051
I found another way
to make it up to you.

- How? And don't offer
to do my homework.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.472
My mom hired
a tutor for that.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.057
- Something better.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.308
You know when Mia locked you

02:22.392 --> 02:24.853
in a janitor's
closet with Emma?

02:24.936 --> 02:26.604

I still have
ESP from it.

but that doesn't matter.

02:30.483 --> 02:34.571
Okay, did you know that Gigi
had her camera in there,

02:34.654 --> 02:36.447
and it recorded everything.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.491
- [gasps] No!
- Yes.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.035
It was frozen,
but she's having it repaired

02:41.119 --> 02:42.370
and you know
what that means.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.455
- Yeah, it's when
you fix things, duh.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.125
- I meant that Gigi will
have proof the realm exists.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.294
And the council
will blame Emma and you.

02:49.377 --> 02:54.090
- Wait, me?
It was all Emma's fault.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.342
If the camera was recording,
the whole tape

02:56.426 --> 02:59.137
is Emma and you messing up
spells left and right.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.097

03:01.180 --> 03:02.932

I don't wanna lose my title

03:30.877 --> 03:31.628
They didn't believe
that you didn't

03:31.711 --> 03:32.962
take Phillip out of the game.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.631

To save me.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.260
- Ha! Hex funny.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.762

03:40.845 --> 03:43.640
- I guess they bonded after
Hex helped him out of the game.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.433
- It's so weird that
the Hex can cast spells.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.144

He was desperate.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.979
Mia had Andi prisoner--
- No, no, no, no, no.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.564
Okay, nobody had me prisoner.

It was all part of my plan.
Okay, I had it covered.

- Ah!

03:59.238 --> 04:01.908

I'd send him back.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.077
- Yes, you did,
I was there.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.537

get rid of the zombie.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.789

go through with this.

the rules without consequences.

Believe me, I know.
- I can't.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.515
I won't send him back.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.934
- I'm sorry, Emma,
I can't let you do this.

Yes,

my secret identity.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.364
It's secret.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.783

I should publish it.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.576

- Never.

Unless you forget
my super secret identity.

I can't do that.

than a macadamia.

Okay, okay.

one scoop for the other.

There's no way he'll survive
back in that game.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.938

him visible again, right?

[all giggling]
- Welcome back.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.274
- Thanks, but that's not
what I wanted to say.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.859
It's really important and--

18:30.943 --> 18:31.985
- Wait, more important
than being a Panther?

18:32.069 --> 18:33.445
[scoffs]
I don't think so.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.865
Now, listen, I wrote a cheer
for Proxy's duel.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.534
- That's what I wanted
to talk about.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.993
You can't let
Diego fight Mia.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.912
She's way stronger
than he is.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.664
- What?
No, she's not.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.666
- Have you tasted
Diego's smoothies?

18:45.749 --> 18:46.667
No way Mia can top that.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.378
He uses real fruit.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.671
- He has to back down,
Maddie.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.506
Mia trains every day.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.007
And if she wins...

18:54.091 --> 18:55.843
- He won't lose.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.011
- But if he does,
according to Kanay law,

18:58.095 --> 18:59.721
he'll have to obey her
in everything.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.599
- No way!
Proxy only obeys me!

19:04.685 --> 19:07.563
- Fresh fruit,
that's a delicious winner.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.442
- Finally,
I found one of you.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.736
- Where's Sophie?
I want my memory card back.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.113
- What are you talking about?

19:16.196 --> 19:17.489
Black Hawk said
you didn't leave it for her.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.241
- Sophie said that?
- What?

19:19.324 --> 19:21.159
- Sophie,
you know, Black Hawk.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.245
Don't play dumb with me,
I know it's Sophie.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.580
I saw her.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.498
- Sophie's not the Black Hawk.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.042
- She is! And I paid her
a whole pound of nuts

19:29.126 --> 19:30.669
and I gave her
my memory card.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.671
Just like your
"instructions" said.

19:32.754 --> 19:35.632
- You gave Sophie
your SIM card?

19:35.716 --> 19:38.218
That makes no sense.
- I did!

19:38.302 --> 19:40.095
And I want my footage back.

19:40.178 --> 19:42.848
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

19:50.272 --> 19:52.107
- The pixels are
up to his elbow now.

19:52.190 --> 19:56.111
- Don't worry, if we don't find
a spell, I'll make one up.

19:56.194 --> 19:59.489
- Andi, Emma, want yogurt?

19:59.573 --> 20:01.825
- I'm good.
- Me, too.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.620
And don't use Hex
as a napkin again.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.121
- Don't you think
it's strange

20:06.204 --> 20:06.747
that the council
hasn't tried anything?

20:06.830 --> 20:08.874
- Don't jinx it.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.250
- Maybe their not
as mad as Jax said.

20:12.252 --> 20:15.756
Wait, I think
I found something.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.633
- What?
- I'm reading, wait.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.603
- Remember, Proxy,

20:29.686 --> 20:32.397
attack first and don't get hit
with any fireballs.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.943
- I won't, I won't.
- You won't what?!

20:36.026 --> 20:37.903
Attack first
or get hit with fireballs?!

20:37.986 --> 20:40.530
- What? Either,
I'm not hitting a girl first.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.782
Even if it's
with a snowball.

20:41.865 --> 20:46.161
- Oh, Proxy,
don't think of her as a girl.

20:46.244 --> 20:48.789
Just think of her as Andi.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.832
- Andi is a girl.

20:52.042 --> 20:52.709
Do you think
she chickened out?

20:52.793 --> 20:55.837
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.298
Maybe she realized that I'm
the more powerful Kanay warrior

20:58.382 --> 21:00.300
and she don't
wanna mess with me.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.345
- I'll bet she did.
[both laugh]

21:03.428 --> 21:04.930
Nope, she didn't.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.056
She's coming.
- Oh.

21:06.139 --> 21:09.226
- You guys showed up.
I'm impressed.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.936
I figured you'd have
your girlfriend

21:11.019 --> 21:14.189
cast a spell and send you
to a hideout or something.

21:14.272 --> 21:14.856
- We didn't think of that.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.024
- Is it too late?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.026
- Let's get started.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.862
[bones crack]
[both groan]

21:20.946 --> 21:23.699
- Uh, shouldn't we go over
the rules first?

21:23.782 --> 21:25.867
- Kanay duels
only have one rule--

21:25.951 --> 21:27.369
there are no rules.
