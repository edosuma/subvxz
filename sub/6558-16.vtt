WEBVTT

00:52.053 --> 00:53.054
Shh.

01:23.668 --> 01:28.422
Wow. They sure picked
a creepy enough place to read a will.

01:28.798 --> 01:30.967
And a creepy enough night too!

01:31.175 --> 01:35.221
Yeah. You would have to
inherit a fortune, Scoob.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.182
- Sorry.
- Well, it was quite a story.

01:38.391 --> 01:40.184
It even made the papers!

01:40.393 --> 01:44.397
Yeah, listen to this!
"Dog named in inheritance."

01:44.647 --> 01:48.484
"Eccentric millionaire, Colonel
Beauregard Sanders...

01:48.651 --> 01:50.903
Ieaves one million dollars...

01:51.153 --> 01:55.157
to four relatives and a dog
named Scooby-Doo."

01:55.658 --> 01:59.537
"Scooby-Doo rescued old Beauregard
from a fishpond...

01:59.745 --> 02:03.165
years before, and was
remembered in his will!"

02:03.541 --> 02:06.794
Well, I wish I'd remembered
not to come along!

02:07.003 --> 02:10.089
No telling what's waiting for us
tonight!

02:23.185 --> 02:28.232
Oh, I see you made it.
Well, bring the dog and come in.

02:28.441 --> 02:31.277
The others are waiting inside.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.029
Yes, sir.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.451
Attention, everybody.

02:40.119 --> 02:44.123
As you all know,
I am Cosgood Creeps...

02:44.332 --> 02:47.126
attorney of the late
Colonel Sanders.

02:47.335 --> 02:52.048
My partner, Mr. Crawls,
couldn't make it tonight.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.260
Creeps and Crawls. They sure picked
the right lawyers for this job!

02:56.427 --> 02:57.511
Shh.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.389
Colonel Sanders was a bit odd...

03:00.556 --> 03:05.561
and his only instructions were
to play this record for you.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.231
<i>Greetings, you all.</i>

03:09.565 --> 03:12.985
<i>Cousin Simple, Nephew Norvell...</i>

03:13.235 --> 03:18.366
<i>sweet Cousin Maldehyde,
Cousin Slicker...</i>

03:18.574 --> 03:21.243
<i>and my old friend, Scooby-Doo.</i>

03:21.744 --> 03:23.412
<i>Since you're all here...</i>

03:23.579 --> 03:27.416
<i>let's get to the nitty-gritty
of inheriting my fortune.</i>

03:27.666 --> 03:32.088
<i>You're going to receive an equal
share of the million dollars...</i>

03:32.254 --> 03:37.134
<i>providing you spend tonight here
in the old family mansion.</i>

03:37.301 --> 03:39.053
That shouldn't be hard.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.263
<i>The house is haunted!</i>

03:41.764 --> 03:43.391
- Haunted?
<i>- Yes, haunted.</i>

03:43.849 --> 03:46.268
<i>And those of you that don't stay...</i>

03:46.435 --> 03:49.772
<i>his share of the fortune will go
to the others.</i>

03:49.980 --> 03:54.360
<i>Now good night and pleasant dreams,
you all.</i>

03:55.903 --> 03:57.321
Oh, boy!

03:58.155 --> 03:59.824
Well, that's it.

04:00.032 --> 04:03.160
I will return to the island
in the morning...

04:03.369 --> 04:06.497
to find out which of you remain...

04:06.705 --> 04:08.457
if any.

04:17.383 --> 04:20.302
Ten o'clock! I suggest we all turn in.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.973
- Yeah, but into what?
- Yeah, what?

04:32.398 --> 04:35.568
Relax, Scooby.
We'll spend the night with you.

04:35.818 --> 04:37.236
Let's hit the sack.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.905
First, I'm gonna hit the lunch sack...

04:40.114 --> 04:42.074
with a Shaggy super-sandwich.

04:45.244 --> 04:48.831
And it looks like Scoob is gonna
hit the bathtub.

04:53.461 --> 04:57.548
Let's see, a little salt
and a little pepper...

04:57.756 --> 05:00.926
and oh, yes, a little fish food!

05:04.096 --> 05:06.515
Zoinks! Sorry!

05:07.725 --> 05:10.436
Hey, Scoob! Hurry it up, will you?

05:18.944 --> 05:20.154
Huh?

05:40.591 --> 05:41.926
YikeS!

05:48.974 --> 05:51.310
I thought you were taking a bath!

05:51.769 --> 05:54.188
Tub tipped to basement.

05:56.607 --> 06:00.444
You mean the tub tipped up
and slid into the basement?

06:00.653 --> 06:04.156
Yeah! And shadow, spooky.

06:07.451 --> 06:10.913
You saw a shadowy,
chain-rattling phantom?

06:11.205 --> 06:12.957
Yeah! Yeah!

06:13.415 --> 06:17.503
You gotta be kidding! Come on,
let's take a look at that tub!

06:18.546 --> 06:21.173
Well, Scooby, the bathtub looks okay.

06:21.340 --> 06:24.843
- And it's bolted down.
- You've got some imagination.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.347
Yeah. Quit with those scary tales,
will you?

06:28.514 --> 06:30.432
Let's get some sleep.

06:40.693 --> 06:42.152
Oh, boy!

07:10.848 --> 07:12.474
Like, what was that?

07:12.683 --> 07:16.604
I don't know! But it came from
Cousin Simple's room!

07:18.105 --> 07:22.109
Poor Cousin Simple. All that's left
of him is his nightcap.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.028
Isn't that a shame?

07:24.236 --> 07:27.239
Get a load of this writing on
this mirror!

07:27.489 --> 07:28.574
It says:

07:28.741 --> 07:31.869
"The first is gone,
the rest will go...

07:32.119 --> 07:36.999
unless you leave the island
and row! Row! Row!"

07:37.207 --> 07:40.711
- Signed, the "Phantom Shadow."
- Phantom Shadow?

07:40.919 --> 07:43.839
- Then you were right, Scooby!
- Uh-huh.

07:44.006 --> 07:48.385
I think we better return to our
rooms and lock our doors!

07:50.220 --> 07:53.932
Fantastic! That dummy looks
just like Scooby-Doo.

07:54.141 --> 07:58.646
- You think this plan will work?
- Sure. I left the door unlocked.

07:58.854 --> 08:03.734
When the Phantom Shadow grabs
the Scooby dummy, we'll all grab him!

08:03.901 --> 08:05.736
All but Shaggy and Scooby.

08:05.944 --> 08:10.449
They've decided to play it safe
and watch from the drainpipe.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.285
I can't think of a safer place.
Can you, Scoob?

08:13.452 --> 08:15.162
Uh-uh.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.545
Don't worry! I'II save you!

08:26.715 --> 08:28.884
- Velma!
- Shaggy!

08:29.093 --> 08:31.220
Let me go!

08:35.933 --> 08:37.601
I told you I'd save you!

08:37.810 --> 08:41.772
Great. But next time,
please don't do me any favors!

08:41.980 --> 08:44.233
Yeah. No favors.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.612
Like, where are we anyhow?

08:48.987 --> 08:52.991
It's some sort of old secret passage
underneath the mansion.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.831
Huh?

08:59.248 --> 09:00.999
- What is it?
- Footprints.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.002
The Phantom Shadow must have
been this way!

09:04.294 --> 09:07.548
That's funny!
If he's a phantom shadow...

09:07.756 --> 09:10.884
- how come he leaves footprints?
- Dirty feet?

09:11.135 --> 09:15.222
Well, we'll follow those dirty feet
and find that phantom.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.433
And you'll lead the way.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.644
But what if the Phantom Shadow
grabs me?

09:21.061 --> 09:25.899
That's the chance I'll have to take.
Now be brave and lead the way.

09:26.275 --> 09:31.530
Yeah, I gotta be brave.
I gotta be brave. I gotta be brave.

09:31.822 --> 09:35.075
I gotta...
I gotta be some kind of nut!

09:35.659 --> 09:39.329
- Gangway!
- Oh, no, you don't!

09:39.663 --> 09:43.333
You're going to be brave
no matter how chicken you are!

09:52.259 --> 09:54.386
The footprints go in there.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.848
Like, wow! What's all that crazy stuff?

09:58.015 --> 10:01.643
Civil War relics!
The colonel used to collect them!

10:01.852 --> 10:03.270
Let's go see.

10:04.271 --> 10:08.692
Uniforms must have been his favorites.
The wagon's full of them!

10:10.694 --> 10:12.196
Yipes!

10:13.697 --> 10:16.033
Zoinks! Haunted uniforms!

10:34.176 --> 10:36.929
Zoinks! Cornered in an elevator!

10:53.070 --> 10:55.322
Wow! You did it, Scooby!

10:55.823 --> 10:57.407
Yeah!

10:58.659 --> 11:02.329
I wonder where this eerie,
old elevator goes to.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.665
Out of here, I hope.

11:06.416 --> 11:11.922
Well, what do you know? It goes to
Cousin Slicker's room. Come on.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.926
But where is Cousin Slicker?

11:16.134 --> 11:19.179
Gone! Like Cousin Simple.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.267
They're all gone.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.770
- Cousin Simple! Cousin Slicker!
- Nephew Norvell!

11:26.937 --> 11:29.064
Sweet Cousin Maldehyde!

11:29.273 --> 11:31.692
All but one.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.945
- Me?
- Yes, you, Scoob.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.363
Oh, boy!

11:36.780 --> 11:39.283
Wow! What a night for a fright!

11:39.449 --> 11:44.121
Yeah! Four missing heirs, a haunted
house and a phantom shadow!

11:44.371 --> 11:46.748
Like, all that's missing
is a spooky organ.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.961
It's not missing anymore.

11:51.795 --> 11:55.090
Come on. Let's find out
where it's coming from.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.142
Well, here's the organ.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.604
Yeah, but where's the kook
that was playing it?

12:08.812 --> 12:11.690
Gone. But he left his
music book behind.

12:11.982 --> 12:15.986
Hey! Let me see that.
There's some writing on the cover.

12:16.153 --> 12:19.364
"Feed the organ and watch the floor."

12:19.573 --> 12:22.492
If anyone gets fed around here,
it'll be me.

12:22.701 --> 12:23.994
Me too.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.414
- You can't feed an organ.
- But you can play one.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.791
I'll play it! I'll play it!

12:34.755 --> 12:36.715
Oh, brother.

12:39.426 --> 12:43.931
- Watch the floor and see what happens.
- We'd better watch the walls!

12:44.097 --> 12:47.267
- Why?
- Because they're closing in on us!

12:50.771 --> 12:51.980
The door's locked!

12:52.272 --> 12:55.400
- Quick, Scooby! Do something!
- Right!

12:57.444 --> 13:02.574
No! Like, keep playing the organ.
It might stop those wild walls!

13:12.292 --> 13:14.628
It worked! The walls stopped!

13:14.795 --> 13:18.632
Let's get out! I don't like playing
musical riddles!

13:18.882 --> 13:23.303
That's it, Daphne!
This is a musical riddle!

13:23.470 --> 13:27.641
I've got it. Feed isn't a word.
It's musical notes!

13:28.308 --> 13:30.894
F-E-E-D.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.152
Look! Secret stairs in the floor!

13:39.319 --> 13:41.655
Come on, let's see where they go.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.702
Creepy, cobweb-filled catacombs.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.996
And that's not all. Look!

13:49.162 --> 13:51.498
Coffins! Five of them!

13:51.665 --> 13:55.502
And the empty one's, like, dog-shaped!

13:55.711 --> 13:56.962
Dog-shaped?

14:00.632 --> 14:02.342
Zoinks! They're opening!

14:02.551 --> 14:05.012
It's them! The cousins!

14:07.180 --> 14:09.224
It's the Phantom Shadow!

14:09.474 --> 14:12.519
Only he's not a shadow.
He's a green ghost!

14:12.728 --> 14:14.730
Now there's two of them!

14:17.024 --> 14:18.692
He's fainted!

14:20.652 --> 14:23.864
- Grab Scooby!
- Like, let's get out of here!

14:27.200 --> 14:30.203
Scooby! Wake up! Wake up!

14:33.373 --> 14:34.875
Come on, Scoob!

14:36.251 --> 14:41.214
Will you wake up for a Scooby snack?
Here, Scoob. Hurry!

14:55.729 --> 14:57.731
Shaggy, stop!

14:58.857 --> 15:01.443
Well, it's about time you woke up.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.281
Yipe!

15:22.923 --> 15:28.011
We fooled that goofy ghost this time.
He'll never find us up here.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.940
Everywhere we look, Scoob,
giggling green ghosts!

15:46.071 --> 15:47.280
Look! Look!

15:47.447 --> 15:49.950
Hey! A wine rack!

15:51.827 --> 15:54.955
Don't fire until you see
the green of his eyes.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.832
Right!

15:59.042 --> 16:00.752
Fire!

16:02.045 --> 16:05.132
- Yippee! Hurray!
- Hurray!

16:07.926 --> 16:12.055
- Let's go, Scooby-Doo!
- Scooby-Doo!

16:21.439 --> 16:22.983
Hello?

16:26.611 --> 16:28.155
It's for you!

16:37.539 --> 16:40.750
Faster! They're, like, gaining on us!

16:43.378 --> 16:45.338
Yeow!

16:48.383 --> 16:49.551
Quick, Scoob!

16:57.767 --> 16:59.561
Like, grab your partner!

17:18.705 --> 17:21.833
Well, we finally ditched
those creepy ghosts.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.044
Yeah, but they'll be back.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.339
How did you get that green stuff
on your hand?

17:27.505 --> 17:30.842
Dancing with those green ghosts.
How else?

17:31.009 --> 17:34.387
That's it! Come on, everybody!
To the laundry room!

17:34.846 --> 17:36.514
Laundry room?

17:37.682 --> 17:41.770
I've seen goofy traps before
but this is the goofiest!

17:41.978 --> 17:43.897
Not goofy, Shaggy. Simple!

17:44.397 --> 17:46.566
We use a fan, soapsuds...

17:46.775 --> 17:50.528
a spring-loaded ironing board
and a washing machine.

17:50.904 --> 17:56.201
When the ghosts come through the door,
we'll take them to the cleaners.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.537
Now let's see how it works.
Ready, Scooby?

17:59.704 --> 18:02.207
- Ready!
- Fan on!

18:07.420 --> 18:08.588
Look! It works!

18:11.925 --> 18:14.803
Scooby-Doo!

18:16.304 --> 18:20.100
Daph, Velma and I will lure the
ghosts through the door!

18:20.392 --> 18:23.770
- When I yell “Now, “ switch on the fan.
- Right!

18:23.937 --> 18:25.772
I'm all set too!

18:30.402 --> 18:32.862
- Here they come now!
- Now?

18:35.240 --> 18:40.787
- Oh, no! Scooby turned it on too soon!
- And, like, in reverse yet!

18:46.042 --> 18:49.587
- A flying washing machine!
- Duck!

18:50.588 --> 18:52.382
They went out the door!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.092
Look out!

19:02.267 --> 19:05.228
They took the elevator down
to the tunnel.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.486
I can't steer this crazy machine!

19:13.778 --> 19:15.780
We'll take the shortcut.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.088
Hang on!

19:39.012 --> 19:43.850
Got them! Looks like these
ghosts are all washed up!

19:45.268 --> 19:49.814
There they are, sheriff. Mr. Creeps
and his partner, Mr. Crawls.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.109
They tried to scare the heirs
off the island!

19:53.318 --> 19:57.822
Then no one would spend the night
and they'd control the fortune.

19:58.031 --> 20:02.786
Creeps pretended to be the phantom,
and make the house seem haunted.

20:02.994 --> 20:07.791
The cousins were scared away. They
put look-alike dummies in the coffins.

20:07.999 --> 20:08.999
Bah!

20:09.042 --> 20:12.212
But that plan backfired.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.673
So did painting themselves
like green ghosts.

20:15.840 --> 20:20.470
Where they're going, Creeps and
Crawls could use a good lawyer!

20:21.888 --> 20:27.852
Here it is. It all belongs to you
now, Scooby! One million dollars!

20:30.021 --> 20:31.523
Oh, no!

20:31.856 --> 20:35.068
Wouldn't you know it!
All in Confederate money!

20:35.318 --> 20:39.697
How about that? We spend a night
of fright for worthless money...

20:39.864 --> 20:42.575
in a haunted house
that wasn't haunted.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.745
- Oh, no! Then what's that?
- Zoinks!

20:45.954 --> 20:49.332
- A floating haunted bone!
- Bone?

20:51.668 --> 20:56.381
I guess haunted bones are one thing
Scooby's not scared of.

20:58.967 --> 21:02.262
- Way to go, Scoobs!
- Scooby-Doo!

21:56.024 --> 21:57.108
Shh.
