00:53.880 --> 00:56.235
<i>Nice night to be born, huh?</i>

00:57.280 --> 01:01.239
<i>Apparently my birth was not
considered a blessed event.</i>

01:01.400 --> 01:05.393
<i>That's me in the basket and
that's my mother carrying me.</i>

01:09.640 --> 01:12.234
<i>And that's my mother...running away.</i>

01:13.680 --> 01:17.309
<i>Well, this can still work
out. Look at this placel</i>

01:17.480 --> 01:19.516
Oh!

01:19.680 --> 01:21.830
Madam!

01:26.200 --> 01:29.476
Aw... aw... aw...

01:32.960 --> 01:37.909
Who on earth would want to abandon
such a wonderful little baby boy?

01:49.800 --> 01:52.360
<i>On the day I was born</i>

01:52.520 --> 01:54.715
<i>The nurses all gathered round</i>

01:54.880 --> 01:57.792
<i>They gazed in wild wonder
At the joy they had found...</i>

01:57.960 --> 01:59.951
<i>But I am not dreaming.</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:05.990
<i>One thing I know, and that is that there's
no such thing in the world as a bad boy.</i>

02:06.160 --> 02:08.354
<i>What does he know?</i>

02:08.520 --> 02:12.991
<i>Bad to the bone Bad to the bone</i>

02:13.160 --> 02:17.233
<i>B- b-b-b bad
B- b-b-b bad</i>

02:17.840 --> 02:19.717
<i>B- b-b-b
bad...</i>

02:19.880 --> 02:21.871
<i>What a strange-looking dogl</i>

02:25.600 --> 02:27.716
<i>I'll bet he's hungry.</i>

02:30.280 --> 02:32.077
<i>This looks good.</i>

02:34.600 --> 02:38.593
<i>B- b-b-b bad
B- b-b-b bad...</i>

02:43.880 --> 02:46.872
<i>Diver Dan, Diver Danl Surface, surfacel</i>

02:51.000 --> 02:55.710
<i>I wanna be yours, pretty
baby Yours and yours alone</i>

02:55.880 --> 02:59.839
<i>I'm here to tell ya, honey
I'm bad to the bone...</i>

03:00.000 --> 03:04.516
<i>These are my favourite toys. Who
am I kidding? They're my only toys.</i>

03:04.680 --> 03:06.875
<i>That's my dad.</i>

03:08.800 --> 03:10.836
<i>So you want to play rough, huh?</i>

03:18.120 --> 03:22.830
<i>I was just kiddingl Oh, nol
Not the nuns, not the nunsl</i>

03:23.720 --> 03:27.508
<i>Bad to the bone
B- b- b- b bad</i>

03:28.320 --> 03:29.673
<i>Bad to the bone</i>

03:29.840 --> 03:32.798
<i>Geel I wonder if penguins can flyl</i>

03:35.600 --> 03:37.875
Help!

03:38.040 --> 03:41.271
Help!

03:42.720 --> 03:45.757
<i>You see? No one really ever accepted me.</i>

03:45.920 --> 03:47.797
<i>Who'd be that caring?</i>

03:47.960 --> 03:50.918
<i>Who'd be that loving?
Who'd be that dumb?</i>

03:52.640 --> 03:55.154
Listen to this. It says here
that Henry is a strong name.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.675
He's loyal and loving.

03:57.840 --> 04:02.152
Henry? Hank. Henri. Sounds like a loser.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.552
No, come on, think about it. Henry,
Hank. Hank Aaron, that's a winner.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.757
"How was school today,
Hank?" "Great, Dad!"

04:09.920 --> 04:13.515
- Let's put a star down next to Henry.
- No, I don't like it.

04:13.680 --> 04:17.992
What about Donald? It says
Donald is wealthy and powerful.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.036
That's the kind of kid I want.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.760
I'll be happy no
matter how he turns out.

04:22.920 --> 04:26.435
- He'll be our child.
- It won't hurt if he's chairman of the board.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.989
So, when is your child due?

04:29.160 --> 04:33.153
I'm not really pregnant yet.
We're just planning ahead.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.311
A little wishful thinking
never hurt anyone.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.869
Here at the clinic we pride
ourselves on a 99%% success rate.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.837
- Little Henry Healy.
- Donald.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.673
Unfortunately, there is that other 1%%.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.355
And you're it. I'm sorry, but
the test came back positive.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.830
- Positive, that's good.
- No, positive is bad.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.150
No, positive is good, negative is bad.

04:55.320 --> 04:59.154
No, negative is good. You see,
you are positively infertile.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.596
You mean we've been doing
it every night for nothing?

05:04.160 --> 05:05.878
Let me explain.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.996
This is your uterus.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.830
That purple thing is your cervix.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.879
These green things are your
fallopian tubes and this...

05:16.040 --> 05:18.508
That's not supposed to
happen. Toss me that.

05:18.680 --> 05:23.595
This yellow thing is your ovary.
Fits right in there like that.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.433
Well, you know what? It doesn't matter.

05:26.600 --> 05:31.037
You don't even have a yellow thing
and your green thing is brown.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.830
- Doctor, are you sure there's no hope?
- None whatsoever.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.356
But there are alternatives
to having your own child.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.869
<i>I tried to like it at the orphanage</i>

05:44.040 --> 05:47.510
<i>but then I became
interested in photography.</i>

05:50.400 --> 05:53.198
<i>After that, things
kind of went downhill.</i>

06:00.080 --> 06:03.470
Eat all of your stew, children.

06:03.640 --> 06:08.156
A growing body needs
nutrition. And discipline.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.915
If it's so nutritious, how
come I don't see you eating it?

06:12.080 --> 06:15.231
- Aw, Junior!
- Junior!

06:21.440 --> 06:25.991
<i>I was never really sure which one
I got, nutrition or discipline.</i>

06:36.160 --> 06:40.950
- What do they put in this stuff?
- Junior, please don't get us in trouble again.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.678
Who are they kidding?

06:58.760 --> 07:00.239
Junior!

07:00.880 --> 07:03.155
What happened to your lunch?

07:03.320 --> 07:06.357
It was so delicious I
just gobbled it all up!

07:13.120 --> 07:18.353
I can't believe it. For once, you
behaved yourself. Thank you, Lord!

07:27.040 --> 07:31.079
Hey, lady, hands off the merchandise!
I gotta hear out of that thing!

07:31.240 --> 07:33.515
Ow...!

07:36.280 --> 07:39.590
All right, mister, you know
the routine. Start mopping.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.716
Sister, I'm all packed to go.

07:41.880 --> 07:47.113
There's my favourite little boy.
I'm going to miss you so much.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.396
Miss him? Where's he going?

07:49.560 --> 07:55.078
Haven't you heard? I'm getting adopted. I
got a new mommy and daddy and they're so nice.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.674
- Really?
- Yes.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.469
Good little boys get good homes.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.269
Bad little boys get something else.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.634
<i>Big deal. If you have to be a creep
like Freddy, I don't want a family.</i>

08:17.640 --> 08:21.599
<i>...a man described as evil incarnate,
a man called "the fiend of the century".</i>

08:21.760 --> 08:23.637
Where are my cartoons?

08:23.800 --> 08:25.870
<i>They did me wrongl They had it comingl</i>

08:26.040 --> 08:28.315
<i>- All 34?
- You bet they didl</i>

08:28.480 --> 08:32.234
This guy's pretty popular.
He's on every channel.

08:33.080 --> 08:37.835
<i>Since he escaped, residents of the bordering
states have been afraid to leave their home.</i>

08:38.000 --> 08:42.232
<i>Beck, known infamously as the Bow Tie
Killer, was recaptured this afternoon</i>

08:42.400 --> 08:45.551
<i>and is now on his way
back to federal prison.</i>

08:45.720 --> 08:48.598
<i>I'm not a bad guyl
I'm just misunderstoodl</i>

08:48.760 --> 08:50.751
<i>Nobody cares about me but mel</i>

08:50.920 --> 08:53.150
<i>What a good-looking guy.</i>

08:53.320 --> 08:58.758
<i>Because of this attempted prison break,
Beck would have to serve additional time.</i>

08:58.920 --> 09:04.916
<i>When he is returned to the federal
prison, Beck will be placed under...</i>

09:19.800 --> 09:21.836
Do you see him?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.070
There's our boy!

09:25.920 --> 09:28.354
Oh, honey!

09:29.520 --> 09:31.670
You guys, I'm so excited!

09:44.560 --> 09:47.074
Have a good day, honey.

09:47.240 --> 09:51.392
Why don't you take a look at this adoption
literature? We can talk about it tonight.

09:51.560 --> 09:56.156
Why don't you? I don't wear second-hand
clothes and I won't have a second-hand kid.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.118
- Adoption is out!
- OK, all right.

10:01.000 --> 10:01.989
Fine.

10:02.800 --> 10:07.351
<i>Welcome to Big Ben's, the sporting
goods store that has everything.</i>

10:07.520 --> 10:11.672
<i>Sporting goods made by
Americans for Americans.</i>

10:11.840 --> 10:15.310
<i>My fellow Americans, don't forget
to vote for Big Ben for Mayorl</i>

10:15.480 --> 10:19.189
- Mister, do you work here?
- I sure do. How can I help you?

10:19.360 --> 10:22.079
I'm looking for a canteen
with a compass on it.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.754
I saw your commercial and
they said you have everything.

10:24.920 --> 10:29.198
You bet we do. This is Big Ben's.
We got canteens 365 days a year.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.591
- Which one of these can I fix you up with?
- This blue one.

10:32.760 --> 10:37.038
- Hey, sport, where did you run off to?
- This man was helping me find my canteen.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.399
I hope Hank wasn't bothering you. He's
excited about this camping trip we're going on.

10:42.560 --> 10:47.793
- You two must have a lot of fun together.
- These little rascals make life worth living.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.554
What the heck else are
we here for, partner?

10:50.720 --> 10:52.153
Let's go!

10:52.320 --> 10:54.880
- Did you get what you wanted?
- Yeah.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.838
- Thanks a lot, buddy.
- My pleasure.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.355
<i>- Little Benl
- What?</i>

11:00.520 --> 11:04.149
<i>Get your little butt in here.
I got a big surprise for you.</i>

11:05.560 --> 11:08.996
<i>That's right, Big Ben's
is 100 per cent American.</i>

11:10.360 --> 11:12.351
I'm selling the store to the Japs.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.953
I... I...

11:14.160 --> 11:18.756
- What? Thought I was gonna leave it to you?
- Yes.

11:18.920 --> 11:22.629
Well, I'm not. I'm selling
to the Hirohito Corporation.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.429
I still get the land, right, Dad?

11:26.600 --> 11:28.909
No, you won't. No, no.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.878
I'm selling that too. Everything
from here to the river.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.396
What? Dad! I can't believe this.

11:35.560 --> 11:40.509
I slaved for you for over ten years
without even a raise or a promotion.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.671
Is there a lesson to be learned?

11:42.840 --> 11:45.354
- A lesson?
- Don't trust anyone.

11:45.520 --> 11:49.115
- Not even your own father?
- Especially your own father.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.191
You're too nice.

11:51.360 --> 11:56.878
I expected a little back-stabbing from you,
some ruthless scrambling to get to the top,

11:57.040 --> 12:00.635
but you stubbornly refuse
to follow my example.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.672
<i>Today's my birthday.
Look what they gave me.</i>

12:08.840 --> 12:10.159
Junior!

12:10.320 --> 12:14.438
Junior! What is taking you so long?

12:14.600 --> 12:18.752
- We start serving dinner in 20 minutes.
- I only got two hands.

12:18.920 --> 12:23.391
I want these pots so shiny
I can see my face in them!

12:23.560 --> 12:25.516
This one kind of looks like you.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.319
All right, now you're gonna pay for it.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.956
- Junior!
- Yikes! A penguin in a pot!

12:37.120 --> 12:39.270
Help!

12:44.280 --> 12:47.397
<i>I wonder if they want
me to do the floorl</i>

12:56.880 --> 12:59.235
Junior!

13:03.080 --> 13:06.675
OK, kids, huddle up. Now,
listen, we got three more innings.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.752
Remember, if we win
we all get ice cream.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.353
Yeah!

13:11.520 --> 13:15.274
And if we lose... What the hay,
we'll have ice cream anyway.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.716
Go take the field. I'm proud
of you! Look mean out there.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.318
Little Ben. Can I talk
to you for a second?

13:22.480 --> 13:25.836
I don't care how many runs you
score. We're not gonna forfeit.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.788
No! I don't care about this game.
We got this thing won already!

13:29.960 --> 13:33.236
I just came over to share my
happiness with you, Little Ben.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.278
Harriet had a sonogram. Take a look.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.795
- What is that?
- It's a boy!

13:38.960 --> 13:40.393
Congratulations.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.597
- I got one of these for you. Open up.
- I don't smoke.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.274
Come on, open up. Open up!

13:49.600 --> 13:52.637
<i>It's a home run for the Chieftainsl</i>

13:52.800 --> 13:56.156
What do you know? Another home run.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.390
Way to go, Gary!

14:04.120 --> 14:06.475
Will you all please
quiet down? Be quiet!

14:08.520 --> 14:11.671
Ladies, please, can
you please quiet down?

14:13.360 --> 14:17.672
Can you quiet down?
Can you act like nuns?!

14:17.840 --> 14:19.239
OK.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.994
Now, there's absolutely no proof

14:22.160 --> 14:25.516
that Junior was in any way
connected with today's tragedy.

14:25.680 --> 14:29.559
- Who needs proof? He's evil!
- Look what he did in art class! Skeletons!

14:29.720 --> 14:32.075
- Headless corpses.
- Monsters devouring human flesh.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.798
All right, look!

14:33.960 --> 14:38.351
I don't claim to be some kind of
brilliant psychologist. I'm not.

14:38.520 --> 14:42.877
All I'm saying is maybe all
the child needs is to be loved.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.508
Let's cut the crap, Mr Peabody!

14:45.680 --> 14:49.593
Either Junior goes or you
find yourself some new nuns.

14:49.760 --> 14:54.629
No, no, please, don't hyperventilate.
Just take a deep breath and relax.

14:54.800 --> 14:59.396
The only way we can straighten this out
is by hearing what Junior has to say.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.071
I'm sorry, sisters.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.915
Please, please don't make
me lift those heavy stones

15:15.080 --> 15:17.833
and please don't make me
scrub those dirty toilets.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.117
I just want to be a good boy. I promise!

15:21.280 --> 15:24.317
You see that? He said he's sorry.

15:24.480 --> 15:29.679
Please, give me another chance. I just
want to learn my lessons and do my studies.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.274
So I can be smart and become a priest!

15:32.440 --> 15:35.079
There! You see that? A priest!

15:35.240 --> 15:37.470
A priest! It's like a nun with a jacket.

15:37.640 --> 15:41.155
It's a boy nun! He
wants to be a boy nun.

15:41.320 --> 15:45.791
Let me tell you something. It takes
a big man to admit his mistakes.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.916
And there is a big man!

15:48.080 --> 15:52.915
It is in the opinion of myself
and my agency of which I represent

15:53.080 --> 15:56.595
that Junior will not be
removed from this orphanage.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.354
Removed? What do you mean, removed?

15:59.520 --> 16:00.919
Don't worry about it.

16:01.080 --> 16:05.995
The nuns made a suggestion you might
be happier outside of the orphanage.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.798
- What's so funny?
- You are, you stupid dick.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.154
He's wicked!

16:14.320 --> 16:18.108
You're not saying you'd rather
not be in the orphanage, are you?

16:18.280 --> 16:21.989
Think much, pea brain? I want out!

16:22.160 --> 16:25.197
You see, Mr Peabody? The
child is incorrigible!

16:25.360 --> 16:28.113
I'm what? Why don't
you speak English, lady?

16:28.280 --> 16:30.191
Look, maybe...

16:30.360 --> 16:33.909
- Uh, maybe...
- What the child is trying to say is...

16:34.080 --> 16:39.871
Maybe if I shrug and move my hands like this,
people will think I know what I'm talking about.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.874
It's obvious that the kid's
unbalanced. I knew that from the start.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.555
I was playing devil's
advocate. Devil, you know...

16:47.720 --> 16:50.712
Anyway, on behalf of
myself and the agency,

16:50.880 --> 16:55.874
this child is going to be removed from
this orphanage as soon as possible!

16:56.040 --> 17:00.477
Well, hurry the hell up!
I'm not getting any younger!

17:15.119 --> 17:20.672
There's Ed and Sally and little Joey going
into the Whites'. There must be a party.

17:20.839 --> 17:26.436
Look at her dress. That's a new... I've
looked all over for shoes like that.

17:26.599 --> 17:31.037
- Wonder why we weren't invited.
- Same reason we weren't invited to the rest.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.589
You can't go to a kids'
party without a kid.

17:34.520 --> 17:39.196
Being a parent is power and once you're
in that circle you keep everyone else out.

17:39.360 --> 17:45.117
Flo, being a parent is about sharing.
It's about a mom, a dad and a kid.

17:45.280 --> 17:50.434
Except there isn't going to be a kid,
Ben. It's just you and me forever.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.270
- Why can't we adopt?
- We've been through this!

17:58.440 --> 18:02.956
I know, but we have so much love to
give. Why waste it on these stupid pets?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.429
They are not stupid!

18:05.600 --> 18:07.238
Hello!

18:07.400 --> 18:12.030
Think of it this way. All those mothers
had to make do with what nature gave them.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.829
You and I get to pick out our
kid. It'll be like shopping.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.912
- Shopping?
- Uh-huh.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.629
But the neighbours will know
we've adopted. What'll they say?

18:22.800 --> 18:25.951
The neighbours? They'll say, "Look!"

18:26.120 --> 18:30.796
"There's Ben and Flo Healy going out to yet
another birthday party with their new son!"

18:30.960 --> 18:33.155
"Isn't he adorable?"

18:33.320 --> 18:36.949
"And look at how fantastic
Flo looks in her new dress!"

18:37.120 --> 18:40.271
"Where did she get a bag
to match those shoes?"

18:40.440 --> 18:44.433
Then they'll say, "Let's invite
that Healy family over for dinner."

18:44.600 --> 18:47.114
Oh, Ben, dinners!

18:47.280 --> 18:49.919
OK, let's get a kid.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.198
Hurry up, students. Five more
minutes for your pen- pals.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.999
Then we have to work
on our times tables.

18:57.440 --> 19:02.468
<i>Dear Queen Elizabeth, how is England?
It must be nice to be a queen.</i>

19:02.640 --> 19:05.313
<i>Dear Bishop Tutu, how are you?</i>

19:05.480 --> 19:09.359
<i>I am fine. I hope everything's
going well with your marching.</i>

19:09.520 --> 19:11.670
<i>Dear Bow Tie Killer, how's prison?</i>

19:11.840 --> 19:16.630
<i>There's a nice picture of you on the front
page that I'm gonna add to my collection.</i>

19:16.800 --> 19:21.954
<i>Even though we've never met, I feel we
have a lot in common. Nobody understands us.</i>

19:22.120 --> 19:26.079
<i>I'm still wearing a bow tie
so I can look just like you.</i>

19:26.240 --> 19:31.439
<i>After all these letters, I've got good
news. I'm getting out. Isn't that great?</i>

19:31.600 --> 19:34.672
<i>Your number one fan, Junior.</i>

19:43.400 --> 19:45.960
Smoke.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.359
Sir.

19:54.680 --> 19:58.753
Sir, sorry to disturb you
but this letter came for you.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.714
Read this to me.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.394
Hey, it's a letter from JR.

20:08.560 --> 20:12.189
Yeah? Someday we're gonna
meet up on the outside.

20:12.360 --> 20:15.113
We're gonna do some serious damage.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.510
"Good news, I'm getting out."

20:17.680 --> 20:22.595
What? He's getting paroled?
They gotta be out of their minds!

20:22.760 --> 20:25.115
You know that guy?
He's crazier than I am.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.191
Chill. The warden!

20:27.960 --> 20:33.592
Well, well! If it isn't our model prisoner,
looking so pretty today in his little bow tie!

20:33.760 --> 20:35.876
Hey, warden! Catch!

20:39.680 --> 20:43.559
I hope I'm not rushing you. We can
always let nature take its course.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.599
Nature screwed us over.
Let's give commerce a try.

20:49.400 --> 20:54.633
Let's see what I can do. You want a kid you
could love, I'll put you on the waiting list.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.155
You should have a kid in seven years.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.550
- Seven years?
- Unless...

20:59.720 --> 21:03.998
Nah, nah, I didn't say a
word. I did not say a word.

21:04.160 --> 21:07.152
No, what? What were you gonna say?

21:07.320 --> 21:12.678
Well, I really put my foot in my mouth
this time but, I don't know, I like you two.

21:12.840 --> 21:17.630
I like the two of you and when I like
two people, I want to help them out.

21:17.800 --> 21:22.351
That's just my nature. I want
to help out people that I like.

21:22.520 --> 21:26.479
Just this morning I came
upon a seven- year- old.

21:26.640 --> 21:31.589
Smart as a tack, a little rambunctious
but weren't we all at that age?

21:33.120 --> 21:35.873
I think I even have
a photo here for you.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.835
He does look presentable
in that bow tie.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.638
Adorable!

21:40.800 --> 21:45.476
I don't know. Seven is rather old. I wanted
people to think I had the baby myself.

21:45.640 --> 21:49.997
That's understandable. A lot of women feel
that way. You want a cute little infant.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.993
One that will scream in
the middle of the night

21:53.160 --> 21:58.029
and you'll have to stumble downstairs in
the dark and change his soiled diapers.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.919
You'll do your
housework, eat chocolates,

22:01.080 --> 22:04.709
take care of the kid and
you'll put on 50 or 60 pounds.

22:04.880 --> 22:05.869
No diapers?

22:06.040 --> 22:09.237
You like to sleep late. There'd
be no baby waking you up.

22:09.400 --> 22:14.679
We could skip all that baby junk and
move right into the good stuff like...

22:14.840 --> 22:17.354
...parties and more parties!

22:17.520 --> 22:19.750
I could be president
of the PTA by September!

22:19.920 --> 22:24.277
- Fuzzball will have someone to play with.
- Yes! Fuzzball's our cat.

22:24.440 --> 22:28.194
I can't believe it!
Junior, he loves cats.

22:28.360 --> 22:31.033
Do you hear that? Let's do it.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.919
Mr Peabody, you've got yourself a deal.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.991
And you've got yourself a kid.

22:42.880 --> 22:46.156
Here he comes. Flo, that's our son.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.839
Can you believe it? That's our boy.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.549
He's very handsome. I'll be
the envy of the neighbourhood.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.518
They look like a couple of yahoos.

23:00.760 --> 23:01.749
Hi!

23:03.000 --> 23:04.433
I think I'm gonna cry.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.637
<i>You ever seen a grown
man wear so much blue?</i>

23:07.800 --> 23:10.234
Hey there, little buddy.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.631
I'm Ben, this is Flo.
Put it there, partner.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.837
My name's Junior. My favourite
colour's blue. What's yours?

23:18.360 --> 23:21.591
My favourite colour's blue,
too. Can you believe...?

23:21.760 --> 23:25.036
He's perfect. He's wonderful. Come here.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.272
Thank you, sisters,
goodbye. Goodbye, kids!

23:28.440 --> 23:31.079
Bye, everybody! Don't forget to write!

23:37.400 --> 23:41.154
We got the pick of the litter.
Everyone's come out to see him off.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.549
Here we are! Isn't this exciting?

24:03.720 --> 24:08.111
Right, everybody out.
This is gonna be so great!

24:08.280 --> 24:14.116
OK, now, everybody over by the house.
This is Junior's first day at his new home.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.589
OK, I want everyone over. Come on.

24:16.760 --> 24:20.639
Junior, put your suitcase down
here. Darling, I want you to hug him.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.758
A lot of teeth. I want
everybody to be happy.

24:23.920 --> 24:27.595
- Smile and say, "cheese doodles!"
- Cheese doodles!

24:27.760 --> 24:30.194
That's great, that's terrific.

24:30.360 --> 24:35.070
How come you adopted me? How
come you just didn't have a baby?

24:35.240 --> 24:37.595
Well, gee...

24:37.760 --> 24:41.639
With a baby, you never know what
you're getting. It could be a dud.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.075
But with you there's no surprise.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.913
- Mr Peabody told us how terrific you are.
- He did?

24:47.080 --> 24:51.596
Sure. He said that you were voted
most popular orphan two years in a row.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.955
That was smart of him.

24:55.360 --> 25:00.150
- In we go.
- Wow. This is a great house.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.517
We're going to keep it
neat and clean, aren't we?

25:08.520 --> 25:10.795
I hope you guys are insured.

25:12.520 --> 25:17.196
And you have a cat. Here, kitty-kitty.

25:17.360 --> 25:22.036
No, Junior, make nice with
kitty. Only pet her this way.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.272
I've never seen Fuzzball act like that.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.432
Junior, come here. I
want you to meet Polly.

25:28.600 --> 25:33.355
- Polly, say hello to Junior.
- Hello. Hello.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.954
Is that the only word he knows?

25:36.120 --> 25:39.430
- Yes. I want to show
you the house. - Uh-oh!

25:41.360 --> 25:45.148
- Do I get my own bed?
- This is the big time! You get your own room!

25:45.320 --> 25:48.517
- Wow!
- I hope you like clowns.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.829
<i>Oh, my God. They're retarded.</i>

25:55.800 --> 25:57.791
So, what do you think, big guy?

25:57.960 --> 26:01.396
Well, there sure are a lot of clowns.

26:04.080 --> 26:08.835
That must be your new grandpa. You stay
here. We'll give old gramps a big surprise.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.319
Sh!

26:17.520 --> 26:19.476
Dad, are we glad to see you.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.996
What's this big surprise
you dragged me over here for?

26:23.160 --> 26:26.516
Well, Dad, here's a hint.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.991
Oh, my God.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.957
Finally.

26:33.680 --> 26:37.753
You've both cooked up a cute
little kid for my campaign!

26:37.920 --> 26:41.799
I thought you were getting fatter,
Mama! When's my little grandson due?

26:41.960 --> 26:46.317
- Fatter?
- No, Dad. Florence is not gonna have a baby.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.752
You rascal, you!

26:48.920 --> 26:53.789
You followed my advice and took your sperm
to somebody who knows what to do with it,

26:53.960 --> 26:55.154
a surrogate mother.

26:55.320 --> 27:01.156
Tell me something. Do you make out with a
cup or do you get to bump a real live one?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.072
No, Dad, we adopted.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.515
Are you insane?

27:06.760 --> 27:09.069
I thought you'd be happy. Come on.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.073
You don't know what you're
letting yourself in for.

27:12.240 --> 27:14.800
Dopehead mothers. Garbage blood.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.952
His parents may have met in a
loony bin. They might be Democrats.

27:18.120 --> 27:22.716
He's a beautiful kid. Once you meet
him, you'll love him like your very own.

27:22.880 --> 27:27.351
I would like to proudly present the
newest member of the Healy family, Junior!

27:28.680 --> 27:30.477
No! Junior!

27:30.640 --> 27:33.313
That's a thousand-dollar coat!

27:33.480 --> 27:36.631
- Junior, are you in here?
- Junior!

27:36.800 --> 27:40.270
Oh, my God. It's the devil.

27:40.440 --> 27:43.796
- Buddy, are you OK?
- Yeah, just a little smoky.

27:45.680 --> 27:49.593
Look, here's the problem. This
clown must have shorted out.

27:49.760 --> 27:53.116
Sparks were coming out of
his nose. I was so scared.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.750
- Little punk is lying.
- Dad!

27:56.920 --> 28:00.959
I hope you kept the damn receipt.
You got one bad seed there.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.908
He can hear you. You'll hurt his
feelings. It was just an accident.

28:05.080 --> 28:08.629
- Accident! Get rid of him.
- We've made our decision.

28:08.800 --> 28:12.679
OK, but it's the last time
I set foot in this house.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.431
Come on, boys.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.478
- Get back.
- What's happening?

28:27.640 --> 28:30.154
Get rid of that kid!

28:31.440 --> 28:34.637
- Get rid of him.
- Easy!

28:35.680 --> 28:38.319
Get rid of that kid!

28:43.320 --> 28:46.517
Poor Fuzzball. She'll never be the same.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.272
Are you ser...

28:48.440 --> 28:51.796
Is that all you can think
of is your stupid cat?

28:51.960 --> 28:57.717
What about the fact that Father's on his way to
the hospital? Or Junior's traumatic first day?

28:57.880 --> 28:59.871
Did you think about the poor boy?

29:00.040 --> 29:01.951
He must feel horrible.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.594
<i>Yeah, but this might
make me feel better.</i>

29:07.600 --> 29:11.070
Fifty, sixty, seventy...

29:17.520 --> 29:19.590
I see a furry bunny.

29:20.920 --> 29:26.074
A furry bunny is running through
delicate white snowflakes.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.754
He's lying. That's not what he sees.

29:28.920 --> 29:33.118
I'm sorry, I'm conducting an
examination. Now what do you see, Martin?

29:33.280 --> 29:35.714
I see a meadow. Pink flowers.

29:35.880 --> 29:41.034
He's lying again. How can he see pink? It's
a black and white picture. There is no pink.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.431
Warden, if you don't stop,
I'll have to ask you to leave.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.431
There is no pink.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.279
I see white fluffy clouds...

29:51.440 --> 29:54.591
No, you don't! You see
murder! You see guts!

29:54.760 --> 29:56.876
I'm going to ask you to leave!

29:57.040 --> 30:00.396
Those damn liberal laws! Don't
you understand? He sees blood!

30:00.560 --> 30:02.551
No, that's what you see.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.753
I am so sorry about that, Martin.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.394
Now, let's get back to
our examination. Shall we?

30:12.560 --> 30:14.437
What do you see in this one?

30:14.600 --> 30:17.068
I see...

30:17.240 --> 30:19.037
...blood!

30:25.120 --> 30:28.954
- Doc, how did it go with the star patient?
- Oh, that guy.

30:29.120 --> 30:32.157
There's a few bricks
missing from his building.

31:01.680 --> 31:05.514
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

31:05.680 --> 31:06.954
Gosh, what happened here?

31:07.120 --> 31:11.830
I was looking for some paper to write a get
- well note to Big Ben.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.516
That's very thoughtful, Junior,
but these are Mom's private drawers.

31:16.680 --> 31:20.559
You shouldn't go in there. It's where
she keeps her needlepoint and crochet.

31:31.680 --> 31:36.276
I'm really sorry, Mr Healy. I was
scared being all alone in my room.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.036
Of course.

31:40.200 --> 31:44.716
I understand why you're scared. This
is your first night in your new home.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.316
It's gonna take some
getting used to, isn't it?

31:48.480 --> 31:54.430
You know, Junior, I'm a little scared
myself. This is my first night being a dad.

31:54.600 --> 31:58.434
- You'll learn quick enough.
- Learn what?

31:58.600 --> 32:02.559
What it's like to be a dad.
Then you'll get rid of me.

32:03.560 --> 32:08.759
Get rid of you? Junior. We're never
gonna get rid of you. You're here forever.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.434
We're gonna do everything together.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.149
We'll ride bikes, go
fishing, play catch.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.630
I want to be a good dad.
I want to be a great dad.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.119
You know what?

32:20.280 --> 32:22.669
I will never be too busy to sit down

32:22.840 --> 32:27.391
and listen to what's on my son's
mind over a cup of hot cocoa.

32:33.720 --> 32:37.508
Hey, sleepyhead. Y'all
ready to go camping?

32:37.680 --> 32:41.195
I was planning on watching cartoons.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.430
Don't be such a noodle.

32:43.600 --> 32:48.754
When I was your age, your grandfather
was always too busy to take me camping.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.070
You are a lucky duck.

32:51.240 --> 32:54.277
Ben! Bring him.

32:55.200 --> 33:00.752
- Come here, I want you to meet someone.
- Mrs Henderson! And little Miss Lucy!

33:00.920 --> 33:02.911
What a nice surprise!

33:03.080 --> 33:08.916
We heard about your little accident and we
thought this fruitcake might cheer you up.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.830
Thank you!

33:12.000 --> 33:15.276
I would like you to meet my son Junior.

33:15.440 --> 33:18.398
- Pleased to meet you, ladies.
- Oh, my!

33:18.560 --> 33:21.632
He's a perfect little
gentleman. Isn't he, Lucy?

33:21.800 --> 33:23.552
He's so big.

33:23.720 --> 33:27.918
Yesterday they didn't even have a kid
and now they have a seven-year-old.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.355
That's gross.

33:30.520 --> 33:34.479
- I don't want him at my party.
- Lucy.

33:34.640 --> 33:40.078
But, Mother, he dresses like
the man that cremated Uncle Leo.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.674
Lucy's turning six this week

33:42.840 --> 33:47.118
but I don't think we'll
have a clown this year.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.670
Or balloons. Or ice cream.

33:52.840 --> 33:58.836
I'm having a birthday party Saturday.
I think it would be nice if you came.

34:02.880 --> 34:07.192
We'll see you Saturday at two.
Come on, Lucy, get in the car.

34:07.360 --> 34:12.036
- Thanks. I'll return the lovely platter.
- Thanks again.

34:12.199 --> 34:15.875
We have finally been accepted. This
parent crap is really paying off.

34:16.040 --> 34:20.272
It's a dream come true. A birthday party.
Now we're going camping with our son.

34:20.440 --> 34:24.638
Not me. I'm going to buy a dress
for the party. Give me some money.

34:24.800 --> 34:28.395
- You're not going camping with us?
- Not on your life.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.710
OK.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.632
Junior! This gives me an idea.

34:32.800 --> 34:37.237
I don't see why my son shouldn't
be getting his own allowance.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.630
- What do you say?
- All right!

34:39.800 --> 34:44.315
This is gonna give you a good
opportunity to learn to manage money.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.396
How do you manage a buck?

34:47.560 --> 34:52.031
Come on, Mr Molasses,
let's go. We're late.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.478
Neat! Bears!

35:02.640 --> 35:06.713
Don't worry, buddy, bears
rarely attack unless provoked.

35:06.880 --> 35:10.270
Let's keep our eyes
peeled for camp site 32.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.431
That's the one Roy
reserved especially for us.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.957
Nice spot your friend reserved
especially for us, Mr Healy

35:19.120 --> 35:23.796
- This is nature, huh? The sky, the trees?
- The toilets.

35:23.960 --> 35:29.512
You're not gonna see the sunset over there. Come on over, watch on our river
- bank.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.830
I'd tell him to shove it, Mr Healy.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.755
It's no big deal. More important, why
don't you call me Dad? I'd really like that.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.912
I want to go home and watch TV.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.435
TV? What's TV compared to the...

35:42.600 --> 35:45.398
...to the call of the wild
bobolink, and that spruce?

35:48.120 --> 35:50.350
That's a pretty big bobolink.

35:50.520 --> 35:55.878
<i>Old MacDonald had
a farm E- i- e- i-o...</i>

35:57.120 --> 35:59.918
Hey, Little Ben.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.437
- Kids, the wienies are almost done!
- Yeah!

36:04.600 --> 36:06.795
I don't believe this.

36:06.960 --> 36:12.353
<i>Those are Roy's kids. They're sharing a
brain. The one on the end has it today.</i>

36:14.600 --> 36:18.479
Little Ben. Come here,
inside. Get in here, come on.

36:20.560 --> 36:25.475
- How does it feel, camping with your son?
- Roy, it's great. It's a dream come true.

36:25.640 --> 36:29.838
Forget the fact that you had to
go to the kid emporium and buy one.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.595
We can't all produce six perfect
little angels like me and Harriet.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.797
I only got one, but
he's one in a million.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.317
Gee, Roy.

36:41.480 --> 36:44.836
- It's gonna give the kids a scare, isn't it?
- You got me.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.835
- Wait a minute. I got something else for you.
- I can't wait to see their faces light up.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.797
It's so real.

36:51.960 --> 36:56.033
Little Ben, now that you're a
father, try this on for size.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.075
Gee, thanks, Roy.

37:03.880 --> 37:08.237
<i>The monkey thought it was all
in fun Pop goes the weasell</i>

37:08.400 --> 37:13.030
<i>A penny for a spool of
thread A penny for a needle</i>

37:13.200 --> 37:17.193
<i>That's the way the money
goes Pop goes the weasell</i>

37:17.360 --> 37:20.750
- All right! What do we do now?
- Let's tell ghost stories.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.798
- Let's roast marshmallows.
- Let's light a forest fire.

37:23.960 --> 37:28.476
- Don't you know it's bad to light forest fires?
- That's the whole point.

37:28.640 --> 37:32.394
- I'm gonna tell my daddy on you!
- I'm gonna tell.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.393
- Give him the silent treatment.
- Yeah, ignore him.

37:38.040 --> 37:41.191
Ignore this.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.351
Gross!

37:47.800 --> 37:52.351
This outdoor life is gonna be just the ticket
for Junior. He's gonna blossom out here.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.556
We sure do enjoy it.

37:54.720 --> 37:58.838
I bet you've never been camping
before. It's so much fun.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.072
There's singing. Marshmallows.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.913
And all sorts of stupid humans to scare.

38:07.760 --> 38:12.072
<i>Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream</i>

38:12.240 --> 38:16.279
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily Life is but a dream</i>

38:26.000 --> 38:27.991
Roy, you devil.

38:31.600 --> 38:36.628
What's the matter, kids? You afraid of
a measly little bear? He's not so bad.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.797
Great. This is great, Roy.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.636
Let's see if he's ticklish. Mr
Bear ticklish? Coochie-coochie!

38:47.000 --> 38:48.319
Coochie...

38:48.480 --> 38:51.631
That was close! You...

38:54.120 --> 38:55.439
Roy?

38:55.600 --> 38:58.068
Roy! Help!

38:58.240 --> 39:00.549
Help! Help!

39:10.800 --> 39:13.360
Stay here, stay here.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.075
- Where did he go?
- I think it left.

39:38.960 --> 39:42.270
He must have learned
it from the tourists.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.432
Roy!

40:07.280 --> 40:11.592
I can't get it out of my head that Junior
was responsible for the camping thing.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.955
He was laughing his head off.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.076
Just lock him in his room tonight.

40:16.240 --> 40:19.789
It says that children often
misbehave just to get attention

40:19.960 --> 40:24.715
and we should resort to discipline only when
other forms of positive reinforcement fail.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.350
Up yours! Up yours!

40:28.520 --> 40:31.876
- Reinforce that.
- Dickhead.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.151
Mrs Henderson, your home is lovely.

40:40.320 --> 40:43.517
- Call me Marion.
- Marion, this is fabulous.

40:43.680 --> 40:48.231
There's nothing more wonderful than
children playing, hearing them laughing.

40:48.400 --> 40:51.597
- Excuse me.
- Did you see Junior's outfit?

40:52.360 --> 40:54.954
Isn't he precious?

41:00.480 --> 41:03.313
Also, Big Ben means big business!

41:03.480 --> 41:07.553
Junior, I got some buttons for the
kids and some stickers for their bikes.

41:07.720 --> 41:11.508
Do your grandfather a favour and
pass them out among your friends.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.274
What for?

41:14.440 --> 41:16.237
What for?

41:16.400 --> 41:20.313
- For ten bucks, that's what's for.
- Sure, Grandpa!

41:20.480 --> 41:22.198
Kids, huh?

41:35.360 --> 41:38.716
Put that down! That's mine!
These are all my presents!

41:38.880 --> 41:43.954
- I was only looking at it.
- You're gonna break it! Get away from it!

41:44.120 --> 41:48.716
- Who's that?
- He can't play with us. He's got cooties.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.678
He's not even a real kid. He's adopted.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.274
Gross!

41:54.440 --> 41:58.319
All right, boys and girls, come
on out. Time for the magic show.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.879
All right!

42:01.840 --> 42:04.115
- You can't come out.
- Why not?

42:04.280 --> 42:05.508
'Cause I said so.

42:05.680 --> 42:10.913
It's my party and I get to say who
can watch my magic show and who can't.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.950
- Why aren't you outside?
- Clowns are dumb.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.270
It's tough being left out, isn't it?

42:36.160 --> 42:39.994
If I give you something, would
you promise to take care of it?

42:47.600 --> 42:51.070
My grandfather gave this
to me just before he died.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.800
What is it?

42:53.960 --> 42:57.919
It's a prune, hardened.
It's a hardened prune.

42:58.080 --> 43:02.870
Grandfather became a little senile toward
the end. He thought it resembled Roosevelt.

43:03.040 --> 43:08.512
But the important thing is that
it's a bond between two people.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.714
I've kept it in my pocket for 30 years.

43:12.880 --> 43:16.350
- Ben, I want you to meet the Hofsteders!
- Coming, sweetheart.

43:17.280 --> 43:20.556
- I know you'll take good care of it.
- Ben, move it!

43:28.600 --> 43:31.910
<i>You can't come to my magic show.</i>

43:32.640 --> 43:35.074
<i>I had some magic of my own.</i>

43:36.000 --> 43:39.470
<i>It's my party and I'll cry if I want to</i>

43:39.640 --> 43:43.792
<i>Cry if I want to Cry if I want to</i>

43:43.960 --> 43:49.080
<i>You would cry too if it happened to you</i>

43:50.480 --> 43:54.109
<i>Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone</i>

43:54.280 --> 43:57.829
<i>But Judy left the same time</i>

43:58.000 --> 44:03.791
<i>Why was he holding her hand?
When he's supposed to be mine</i>

44:05.080 --> 44:08.356
<i>It's my party and I'll cry if I want to</i>

44:08.520 --> 44:12.274
<i>Cry if I want to Cry if I want to</i>

44:12.440 --> 44:17.036
<i>You would cry too if it happened to you</i>

44:19.320 --> 44:22.630
<i>Play all my records
Keep dancing all night</i>

44:22.800 --> 44:26.713
<i>But we were alone for a while</i>

44:26.880 --> 44:33.069
<i>Till Johnny's dancing with
me I've got no reason to smile</i>

44:33.240 --> 44:36.357
<i>It's my party and I'll cry if I want to</i>

44:36.520 --> 44:40.354
<i>Cry if I want to Cry if I want to</i>

44:40.520 --> 44:44.957
<i>You would cry too if
it happened to you...</i>

45:02.000 --> 45:05.436
<i>Judy and Johnny Just
walked through the door</i>

45:05.600 --> 45:09.115
<i>Like a queen with her king</i>

45:09.280 --> 45:15.879
<i>Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring</i>

45:16.040 --> 45:19.237
<i>It's my party and I'll cry if I want to</i>

45:19.400 --> 45:22.710
<i>Cry if I want to Cry if I want to</i>

45:22.880 --> 45:28.557
<i>You would cry too if it happened to you</i>

45:28.720 --> 45:33.316
<i>Oh-oh, it's my party
and I'll cry if I want to</i>

45:33.480 --> 45:37.075
<i>Cry if I want to Cry if I want to</i>

45:37.240 --> 45:42.917
<i>You would cry too if it happened to you</i>

45:43.960 --> 45:48.112
<i>Perhaps this was the one step
too far. This could be a problem.</i>

45:48.280 --> 45:50.794
- I think we've got a problem.
- You think so?

45:50.960 --> 45:54.555
We should get rid of the
kid and buy a new cat!

45:54.720 --> 45:59.953
- You're not making any sense.
- Wanna make sense? Show him who's boss!

46:00.120 --> 46:02.350
Here, be a man.

46:07.800 --> 46:12.669
Please, God, I'm so sorry for what I've
done. I won't ever do it again, I promise.

46:12.840 --> 46:16.389
And I don't ever want to
cause Mr Healy any trouble.

46:16.560 --> 46:19.597
He's the only one that's
ever been nice to me.

46:22.240 --> 46:24.515
Please don't spank me, Mr Healy.

46:25.760 --> 46:29.230
I don't want to but you're
gonna have to be punished.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.756
So, I'm gonna take back your allowance.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.717
The whole buck?

46:34.880 --> 46:37.633
That's right. Now, just hand it over.

46:44.280 --> 46:46.635
<i>I wonder if he's got change for a 20.</i>

46:53.200 --> 46:54.872
OK.

46:55.040 --> 46:57.395
I think you'd better go right to bed.

46:57.560 --> 47:02.509
Just use this time to think about what
you've done and what you're going to do.

47:02.680 --> 47:05.319
Understand?

47:07.560 --> 47:10.199
I hope you've learned a lesson.

47:10.360 --> 47:13.193
Goodnight.

47:13.360 --> 47:16.636
<i>What is this guy, nice or something?</i>

47:28.760 --> 47:31.752
- Can I help you?
- Fill her up.

47:37.160 --> 47:39.754
Smiley pies!

47:39.920 --> 47:42.753
I ain't had a smiley pie in 15 years.

48:16.240 --> 48:20.552
<i>Now, Cold River's favourite
son, Big Ben Healyl</i>

48:22.640 --> 48:27.191
First of all, I'd like to thank everyone
who supported me in my race for Mayor.

48:29.560 --> 48:31.312
This is the Founders Day game.

48:31.480 --> 48:35.871
It doesn't matter who wins or loses,
just so long as Big Ben wins for Mayor.

48:37.680 --> 48:43.357
When you hit one out and that scoreboard
lights up, I want you to remember Big Ben.

48:52.920 --> 48:55.480
<i>We go to the seventh inning tied.</i>

49:08.520 --> 49:14.516
All right, somebody's gonna have to pinch-hit
for Andy. OK, buddy, this is your big moment.

49:15.320 --> 49:19.313
- Who, me?
- Of course you, Junior. I need you to bat.

49:19.480 --> 49:23.837
Get up, grab a helmet.
Get a bat, that's a boy.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.276
But I don't know how to play baseball.

49:27.440 --> 49:30.113
Now is as good a time as any to learn.

49:30.280 --> 49:33.590
- But what happens if...
- It doesn't matter what happens.

49:33.760 --> 49:37.719
The important thing is that you
stand up there and take your cuts, OK?

49:37.880 --> 49:40.678
I'll be proud of you
no matter how you do.

49:40.840 --> 49:46.278
Are you out of your mind, putting that
little monster in the game? I'm on a campaign.

49:46.440 --> 49:49.432
Junior'll do just fine,
Dad. You can do it, buddy.

49:49.600 --> 49:54.230
Nice little tie, moose breath. Bet you sell
a lot of Girl Scout cookies wearing that.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.391
No batter, Cort.

49:56.560 --> 49:59.028
He's cute, isn't he?

50:02.840 --> 50:05.195
Strike one.

50:05.920 --> 50:10.311
If that kid wasn't adopted,
I'd swear he was your real son.

50:10.480 --> 50:13.790
You weren't on the team
the last time we beat you.

50:13.960 --> 50:16.349
The guy I'm staying with is the coach.

50:16.520 --> 50:19.796
You mean that big dork who
buys everyone ice cream.

50:19.960 --> 50:21.951
He is not a dork!

50:22.120 --> 50:26.193
Watch the pitcher, not the
catcher, buddy, come on!

50:37.880 --> 50:40.633
My new car! Oh, my God!

50:40.800 --> 50:46.272
Shake it off. Tighten up that grip, all
right? Meet the ball. Hold onto the bat, OK?

50:46.440 --> 50:48.874
- Come on, boy!
- Good idea.

50:49.040 --> 50:51.554
Yeah, hold on to the bat.

50:51.720 --> 50:54.439
Son of dork, son of dork!

50:54.680 --> 50:58.593
Son of dork!

50:59.560 --> 51:01.790
Oh, no.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.470
Drop the bat, son!

51:20.440 --> 51:22.271
That's no good!

51:22.440 --> 51:24.510
You can't do that.

51:24.680 --> 51:27.114
Whoa!

51:28.360 --> 51:31.557
Drop the bat, Junior! Are you nuts?

51:35.160 --> 51:37.310
Whoa!

51:47.920 --> 51:49.911
Come on, I got something for you!

51:53.560 --> 51:55.437
Ow!

51:56.200 --> 51:58.919
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

51:59.080 --> 52:02.072
Touchdown!

52:12.960 --> 52:15.030
We've adopted Satan.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.909
I don't now what you could've been
thinking about! We've done all we can.

52:19.080 --> 52:22.755
Now, you wait right here.
I'm gonna get the priest.

52:25.240 --> 52:29.153
Hello, Mr Healy. Remember
me? You sold me a canteen.

52:29.320 --> 52:31.754
Boy, did we have a great camping trip!

52:31.920 --> 52:35.037
I caught three fish.
My dad was really proud.

52:35.200 --> 52:37.475
Blow it out your ass.

52:39.920 --> 52:42.275
Junior. Junior!

52:42.440 --> 52:44.431
Get back here, you little heathen!

52:45.760 --> 52:48.752
Junior! Where are you, you little creep?

53:05.760 --> 53:09.150
Bless me, Father, for I
have sinned. Father? Father?

53:11.000 --> 53:14.310
Father, I'm at the end of
my rope. It's about my kid.

53:14.480 --> 53:19.998
He's a real problem. He does terrible things.
My father hates him. My wife hates him.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.878
Everybody hates him.

53:22.040 --> 53:24.395
Everybody except me. And I've had it.

53:24.560 --> 53:27.518
God! I've failed,
Father. The kid hates me.

53:27.680 --> 53:32.595
It's time I faced up to what I do have to
do. I'm gonna take him back to the orphanage.

53:32.760 --> 53:37.117
No, no, you don't want to do that!
That's the worst thing you could do!

53:50.600 --> 53:53.512
- Can I call you back?
- He's all yours.

53:53.680 --> 53:56.319
- Can we discuss this?
- There is nothing to discuss.

53:56.480 --> 54:00.758
- We're signing him back over to you now!
- Bad parents make bad children!

54:00.920 --> 54:03.275
I'm a bad parent because I hate my kid?

54:03.440 --> 54:06.910
- There is something strange about that boy!
- He is twisted!

54:07.080 --> 54:10.231
- You took him! He's yours!
- You conned us into it!

54:10.400 --> 54:15.554
What am I supposed to do with the little
creep? He's already been returned 30 times!

54:15.720 --> 54:17.836
This makes 31!

54:18.000 --> 54:20.594
"We don't care about
brown hair and brown eyes."

54:20.760 --> 54:24.196
"We want to take him into our home
and let him play with our cat!"

54:24.360 --> 54:26.749
Hold it! Stop, wait!

54:26.920 --> 54:30.595
What are we talking about?
Thirty? Thirty times?

54:30.760 --> 54:33.149
Flo, did you hear that?

54:33.320 --> 54:35.834
This is a human being
we're talking about!

54:36.000 --> 54:38.275
That kid's a monster!

54:38.440 --> 54:42.228
Flo, we're doing what everybody
else has done to this child.

54:42.400 --> 54:45.676
- It's easy to give up on a kid.
- Damn straight it is.

54:45.840 --> 54:50.960
Isn't that what's wrong with the world today?
Everybody's looking for the easy way out.

54:51.120 --> 54:55.955
They're hoping that their
problems will just go away.

54:56.120 --> 55:00.113
But problems don't
just go, Flo, you know?

55:00.280 --> 55:04.796
So, the question before us is what are
we gonna do with our little problem child?

55:04.960 --> 55:07.076
I'll tell you.

55:07.240 --> 55:12.234
Something that no one's ever done for
him before. We're gonna love him, Flo.

55:13.320 --> 55:17.552
We're gonna love him when he's bad,
we're gonna love him when he's worse,

55:17.720 --> 55:21.713
until one day he's gonna crack and say,

55:21.880 --> 55:25.953
"Hey, these folks really do love me."

55:26.120 --> 55:28.395
"They ain't gonna quit on me."

55:28.560 --> 55:31.518
"I don't have to be bad any more."

55:31.680 --> 55:35.593
"What the hay! I can be
president of the United States!"

55:36.240 --> 55:41.553
President? Are you brain damaged? Junior's
gonna be a convict before he's in third grade!

55:41.720 --> 55:43.199
Sh!

55:43.360 --> 55:45.590
Junior? Son?

55:47.000 --> 55:50.356
- Unlock the door.
- You said you were gonna keep me forever.

55:51.680 --> 55:54.752
I am. I'm sorry, I just made a mistake.

55:54.920 --> 55:58.515
Trust me. We're not gonna
take you back to the orphanage.

55:58.680 --> 56:03.674
I don't believe you! You only pretended to
be my friend. You're just like all the others.

56:05.320 --> 56:08.357
Junior? Now, come on, son.

56:09.920 --> 56:12.559
You moron. You left the keys in the car.

56:13.600 --> 56:17.195
Hey, he can drive! Boy, that's great!

56:17.880 --> 56:21.759
Look at you handle this baby!
I'm so proud of you, son!

56:23.000 --> 56:24.797
Junior!

56:24.960 --> 56:27.793
Hold it!

56:28.920 --> 56:30.592
Get out of the way!

56:31.240 --> 56:33.231
Left! Turn left!

56:34.160 --> 56:36.879
Right, Junior.

56:39.760 --> 56:43.514
No!

56:43.680 --> 56:45.955
No, don't touch that!

56:47.800 --> 56:50.030
Junior!

57:00.960 --> 57:02.712
Watch out!

57:09.120 --> 57:12.556
<i>Born to be wild</i>

57:35.560 --> 57:36.879
Hello?

57:37.600 --> 57:39.955
Ben? Jim O'Connor. Are you sitting down?

57:40.120 --> 57:41.439
Yes.

57:41.600 --> 57:46.515
Bad news. Your father cleaned out your bank
account to pay for the damage to his store.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.877
Nothing can make up for the
loss of your life savings...

57:50.040 --> 57:51.359
Ben?

58:02.240 --> 58:04.231
<i>Uh-ohl He's lost it nowl</i>

58:18.320 --> 58:20.550
All right!

58:25.040 --> 58:27.270
Private business.

58:27.440 --> 58:29.078
Hi!

58:29.240 --> 58:34.394
- Get out of my way, kid. I'm looking for JR.
- That's me! Junior!

58:38.080 --> 58:41.231
I don't have time for this crap, kid.

58:41.400 --> 58:46.155
Now, the guy I'm looking for is an
ex-con and he's as mean as a rattlesnake.

58:46.320 --> 58:49.392
That's me, dummy! I sent
you all those letters.

58:49.560 --> 58:55.157
Man. I drove a thousand miles to
hang out with a seven- year-old?

58:55.320 --> 58:58.995
- I'm gonna be eight in two weeks.
- Don't count on it.

59:03.320 --> 59:08.599
Mr Healy, Mrs Healy, I'd like you to meet
the greatest guy in the whole wide world.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.398
Martin...

59:11.960 --> 59:13.757
Uncle Marty!

59:13.920 --> 59:16.229
Marty, this is Mr and Mrs Healy

59:16.400 --> 59:20.234
and that's the $3,000 stereo
system and the console TV.

59:20.400 --> 59:22.277
How wonderful, an uncle!

59:22.440 --> 59:24.795
You absolutely must stay the night.

59:24.960 --> 59:28.430
It is so wonderful to meet the
uncle of darling little Junior.

59:28.600 --> 59:33.037
Did you hear that? Uncle Marty. We've
gotta treat this guy like royalty.

59:33.200 --> 59:38.274
We've gotta make him think Junior's an angel.
He'll leave and take the little brat with him.

59:38.440 --> 59:41.159
Everybody just loves Junior.

59:41.320 --> 59:45.996
For pocket money he helps some of the
older residents with their groceries.

59:46.160 --> 59:47.957
Isn't that right, Ben?

59:50.080 --> 59:56.030
If only he had a blood relative taking care of
him, someone with a natural tie. Like an uncle!

59:56.200 --> 59:58.270
- More meatloaf?
- Yeah.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.351
I'll get you some.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.353
<i>This guy is just so appealing.</i>

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.829
I'll give you a hand.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.634
Your nephew is such a delight. He's always
cleaning and tidying up after all of us.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.155
Perfect for a single man living alone.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.311
Are you a bachelor, Marty?

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.757
I ain't been with a woman in 15 years.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.673
Women just love single male parents.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.356
If you had a kid like Junior the
women would be flocking over you.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.674
Did you say 15 years?

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.311
Wait.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.512
Stop it!

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.953
Look at all the stuff
I brought for our trip.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.592
I got my ammo. There's guns,
hand grenades and even dynamite.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:41.557
These are toys. What are you jerking
me around for? This is kiddies' stuff!

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.549
What did you do that for?
Don't we need supplies?

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.359
What? I'm not working with you!

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.437
But I thought we were gonna be
partners. I thought you liked me.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.070
I don't like no one. I work alone.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.955
Goodbye, Junior! Goodbye, Flo!
Oh, I am so sad to see you go.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.749
A hundred thousand
dollars? You can keep 'em!

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:13.992
Good morning! Hello, sunshine!

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.190
This was supposed to be our honeymoon!

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.750
You said you loved me! You
called me a little kumquat.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.514
This is our honeymoon, you moron!

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.194
Moron? Moron?

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.036
I went to Radcliffe! I'm not a bimbo
you can tie up and do what you want with!

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.191
- You shut up!
- I will not!

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:39.309
Let me out of here! You stupid
piece of... You're gonna regret this!

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:44.429
I'm gonna be waiting and when I'm done
with you you're gonna be singing falsetto!

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.275
He-e-e-ere's
Daddy!

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.309
Goodbye, Junior!

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.552
<i>Adiosl Hasta luegol</i>

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.676
Sayonara!

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.910
Yeah!

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.873
Yes, that's very creative, Junior.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.679
Yeah, right on the money.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.554
He liked me.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.712
All this time he actually liked me.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.717
Vote for Big Ben. Here, read this.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.191
You can't go in. Your father's making a
television appearance for his campaign.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.950
Dad, I gotta talk to you!

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.240
- What are you doing? I'm about to go on air!
- Florence and Junior have been kidnapped.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.753
Five minutes.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.275
- I need $100,000.
- Are you insane?

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.719
That kid is a monster and your wife is the
original pain in the ass. It's for the best.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.350
- Are you gonna lend me the money?
- No, I'm not.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:23.195
You work for me. I know what
you get. You're a credit risk.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.991
Then I quit as your son!

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.835
Just get out of here. I got
a goddamn campaign to win.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.073
Your campaign, the one
thing you do care about.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.551
Why don't you tell the voters what you
really plan on doing with this town?

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.711
I don't give a rat's ass for the voters.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.237
<i>- We're ready with that live feed.
- All I care about is power and money.</i>

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.118
<i>America for the Americansl
You believe that nonsense?</i>

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.636
<i>I'd sell my soul to the Japanese
if they'd make me an offer.</i>

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.917
<i>Don't come sucking round
me if you want something.</i>

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.548
<i>The only thing you'll
get from me is this.</i>

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.190
- Hello?
- You got the money?

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.279
Yeah.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.591
Good. Bring it to the circus.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.513
I'll be waiting at the tiger cage.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.155
Roy! I need your car.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.232
- Forget it. We're going hunting.
- So am I.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.076
You can't borrow it. We're all packed
up and ready to go. What are you doing?

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.231
You're not going anywhere, buddy.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.792
Wait a minute.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.190
Great, the joke's over. Come on back.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.351
What do you think you're doing?

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.189
Hey! Hey, get back here, you!

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.635
- What is he doing?
- Get back here!

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.914
Gee, I've never been
to the circus before.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.595
- I'd sure like to try a swizzle dog.
- I hate circuses.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.673
Nothing worse than a bunch of
clowns trying to make you laugh.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.629
- Look, a giraffe!
- Look, a fist!

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.915
Clowns.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.878
Help! Help, let me out of here!

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.635
I know you're out there! Help!

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.918
Why isn't anybody doing
anything? I know you're out there!

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.835
Let's go see the bearded lady.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.471
I seen too many of them in prison. Stop
bugging me or you're gonna get hurt.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.474
What did you say, you
bow-tied freak? Let him go!

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.397
Forget it, big daddy!

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.358
This is my show. I'm calling the shots.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.479
OK, we make a switch
on the count of three.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.029
You toss the money and I release Junior.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.918
Fine.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.514
One, two, three!

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.031
- Hey!
- Sucker!

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.591
- Give me the boy!
- Why? He wants to go with me.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.675
How about it, kid? We'll go on a crime
spree. We'll terrorise the whole state.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.434
We'll eat smiley pies until we drop.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.909
What do you say?

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.837
Come on, let's have
some kicks. Tell-a-me.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.672
Tell-a-me.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.796
Yeah, kicks, good idea.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.792
- I'll tear you apart!
- Not while I'm around!

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.035
Run, Junior, run!

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.395

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.631
Hold it!

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.920
<i>The astounding Aslanian Family Tumblersl</i>

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.951
Excuse me, lady!

Look out below!

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.234
- Junior, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.997
- You called me Dad.
- Yeah, I guess I did.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.198
Stay away from...

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:37.433
- He's getting away!
- Nobody messes with the Healys! Come on!

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.113
There he is!

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:45.828
<i>There's nothing like going
for an outing with your father.</i>

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.832
- Look what I found!
- That's Roy's. Give me that.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.036
Why? You can't drive and shoot.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.589
- What do we do?
- I got an idea.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.431
- Go get him, Dad!
- Faster, son, faster!

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.989
Attaboy!

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.515
Shoot out his tyres, Dad!

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.431
Don't mess with me!

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.040
I demand you stop this car!

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.271
<i>He's the wild one</i>

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.237
What the hell is going on?

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.517
- I want a divorce!
- Shut up, Flo!

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.391
Wha...!

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.270
Stop! Hit the brakes!

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.399
Now what's going on? What's that smell?

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.474
Well, Flo always said
she wanted to travel.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.676
- Come on, let's go home.
- Move it.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.831
You little traitor!

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.797
No!

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.717
No!

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.631
Daddy!

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.952
Daddy, please don't go! I'm sorry
for all those bad things I did!

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:38.238
If you come back, I promise I'll
never do anything naughty again.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.472
Daddy, come back! I love you!

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.157
I love you, too, son.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.675
Dad? I don't believe it.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.870
I don't believe it either.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.950
- Are you gonna be OK?
- Yeah.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.548
But the prune's had it.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.237
- Lay still. Ambulance is on the way.
- I'll be all right.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.675
He got me in the prune.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:10.918
You're not gonna hold me to all that stupid
junk I said about being nice, are you?

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.868
Of course not. I just
want you to be yourself.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.434
Some people never learn.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.750
Come on, son.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.679
Come on.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.873
<i>Why does this guy love me?
Why do parents love any kid?</i>

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:47.717
<i>It's one of those answers we'll never know
like "How high is up?", "Why is the sky blue?"</i>

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.269
<i>and "Whatever happened to Mrs Healy?"</i>

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:55.753
- Your pig's making funny noises.
- Big Miguel, he's got a bad stomach.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.111
Oh, my God!
