[cell phone beeping]

00:07.308 --> 00:08.309
HELLO, THIS IS DWIGHT SCHRUTE.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.477
HELLO?

00:09.510 --> 00:10.644
HELLO, THIS IS DWIGHT.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.214
HELLO? HELLO?

00:13.247 --> 00:15.649
YES, WE DO HAVE THAT.
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

00:15.683 --> 00:16.650
JIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:16.684 --> 00:17.751
AND HOW MANY
WOULD YOU LIKE?

00:17.785 --> 00:19.287
UH, UH, HANG THAT UP
RIGHT NOW.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.654
ABSOLUTELY--I CAN GET THAT
OUT TO YOU IMMEDIATELY.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.456
THIS MAN IS AN IMPOSTER.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.425
DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH HIM.
THIS IS NOT DWIGHT SCHRUTE.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.627
DWIGHT LEFT HIS CELL PHONE
ON HIS DESK.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.630
SO, NATURALLY, I PAIRED IT
TO MY HEADSET.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.432
[cell phone beeping]

00:31.465 --> 00:33.634
OKAY, FINE, I'LL JUST
LET IT GO TO VOICE MAIL.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.636
[cell phone beeping]

00:35.669 --> 00:37.638
HELLO, THIS IS DWIGHT.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.507
HEY, IS THIS DWIGHT?
YES, IT IS.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.375
OH, MY GOODNESS,
YOU SOUND SEXY.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.376
OH, THANK YOU.
I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.178
WHOA, WHOA.
PAM, PAM!

00:44.212 --> 00:45.346
YOU ARE NOT TALKING
TO DWIGHT RIGHT NOW.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.648
YOU ARE TALKING TO JIM.
DWIGHT?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.650
NO! PAM, I'M OVER HERE.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.652
I'M CONFUSED.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.287
DISCONNECT THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.655
YOU GIVE ME
YOUR EARPIECE.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.624
I CAN'T DO THAT.
UNSANITARY.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.128
UGH! OKAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT, FINE.

01:00.161 --> 01:04.365
I WILL REPROGRAM MY PHONE
TO GO TO MY OFFICE PHONE.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.501
DONE.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.737
[telephone rings]

01:09.770 --> 01:12.406
THIS IS DWIGHT.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.210
OH, AND I FORWARDED
HIS DESK PHONE TO MINE.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.511
OH, HELLO, MATER.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.248
GOOD NEWS--I'VE MARRIED.
TELL FATER.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.384
SUCH A NICE WOMAN.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.657
AA-AAH!

01:29.690 --> 01:33.661
[cheerful music]

01:33.694 --> 01:41.702
*

01:50.444 --> 01:55.916
(Michael)
TODAY IS TOBY FLENDERSON'S
LAST DAY.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.385
I COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.187
I CAME IN EXTRA EARLY.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.721
SO MUCH ENERGY.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.357
THERE ARE CERTAIN DAYS THAT
YOU KNOW YOU WILL REMEMBER

02:03.391 --> 02:04.525
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.327
AND I JUST HAVE A FEELING

02:06.360 --> 02:08.762
THAT TODAY IS
ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.898
MORNING.
MORNIN'.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.200
SO HERE WE GO.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.567
JUST A MATTER OF HOURS NOW

02:13.601 --> 02:15.669
UNTIL HIS HORRIBLENESS
HAS LEFT THE BUILDING.

02:15.703 --> 02:19.340
I'M GOING TO SET
MY WATCH ALARM...

02:19.373 --> 02:21.375
AND...
[beep]

02:21.409 --> 02:23.677
GOOD MORNING, KELLY.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.679
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS YOUR LAST DAY.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.515
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

02:27.548 --> 02:29.583
FINE. GOOD.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.751
I FEEL WEIRD.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.486
FIRST THING ON THE AGENDA.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.555
ACTUALLY, THE ONLY THING
ON THE AGENDA

02:34.588 --> 02:36.457
IS THAT STATUS
OF TOBY'S GOING AWAY PARTY.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.593
WE HAVE A BUTTERCREAM CAKE
AND A SLIDE SHOW OF TOBY.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.861
OKAY.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.596
BUT SO FAR WE ONLY HAVE
TWO PICTURES OF HIM.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.966
OKAY, WELL,
THIS WILL NOT DO.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.669
TOBY IS GOING AWAY
FOREVER,

02:48.702 --> 02:50.771
AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
VERY, VERY SPECIAL.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.341
IN SOME CULTURES,
WHEN SOMEBODY LEAVES--

02:53.374 --> 02:54.475
LIKE NEW ORLEANS CULTURE--

02:54.508 --> 02:55.909
THEY HAVE A PARADE,

02:55.943 --> 02:57.678
AND THEY HAVE A BAND.
AND PEOPLE PARTY IN THE STREETS.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.748
DO YOU MEAN LEAVES
AS IN DIES?

03:00.781 --> 03:03.217
YOU WANT US TO THROW TOBY
A NEW ORLEANS FUNERAL?

03:03.251 --> 03:06.687
IF THE DEVIL
WERE TO EXPLODE,

03:06.720 --> 03:08.489
AND EVIL WERE GONE
FOREVER,

03:08.522 --> 03:10.658
WHAT SORT OF PARTY
WOULD YOU HAVE?

03:10.691 --> 03:13.261
MICHAEL...
LIKE A BEACH BLOWOUT?

03:13.294 --> 03:14.762
OR A TOGA--TOGA--
NO, YOU KNOW--NO!

03:14.795 --> 03:16.664
TOGA!
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.233
WE HAVE A NICE,
MODEST PARTY PLANNED,

03:19.267 --> 03:20.901
AND THEN YOU COME IN
AND DEMAND THE WORLD.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.603
LET ME BE CLEAR.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.905
THERE IS SIMPLY NO MONEY
FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A CAKE,

03:24.938 --> 03:27.241
AND TO DEVELOP
A FEW MORE SLIDES.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.676
ALTHOUGH TOBY WON'T
BE IN THEM.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.712
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.750
[humming]

03:36.784 --> 03:41.689
(Michael)
EVERY YEAR, MY SWEET,
SWEET GRANDMOTHER

03:41.722 --> 03:44.558
SENDS ME A CHECK ON MY BIRTHDAY
FOR $50.

03:44.592 --> 03:48.296
AND LATELY SHE HAS BEEN
SENDING ME, LIKE,

03:48.329 --> 03:50.598
NINE OR TEN CHECKS A YEAR.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.667
UH, AS NANA STARTS TO--

03:53.701 --> 03:56.670
BUT I KNEW I SHOULD BE
SAVING IT FOR SOMETHING.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.640
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
I SHOULD BE SAVING IT FOR.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.542
AND THEN I HAD
AN AWAKENING.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.678
MICHAEL, BUY A MOTORCYCLE.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.380
SO I PUT THE MONEY
IN MY SHOE,

04:06.414 --> 04:09.049
AND THEN I FORGOT ABOUT IT
UNTIL NOW.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.352
I WANT A PARTY
THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE

04:11.385 --> 04:12.986
I AM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR

04:13.020 --> 04:16.690
WITHOUT THIS UGLY WEIGHT
HOLDING ME DOWN.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.359
YOU KNOW?

04:18.392 --> 04:20.828
I WANT AN ANTIGRAVITY
MACHINE.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.863
I SAW IT IN A MOVIE.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.432
YOU DRINK A POTION,

04:24.465 --> 04:25.699
AND THEN YOU JUST START FLOATING
ALL AROUND.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.067
SO HOW MUCH ANTIGRAVITY POTION
DO YOU WANT?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.369
(Angela)
NO!

04:28.402 --> 04:29.703
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:29.737 --> 04:30.871
THIS IS NOT A PARTY-PLANNING
COMMITTEE ANYMORE.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.706
AND I DON'T WANT
YOUR FOOT MONEY.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.675
AND I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
PARTICIPATING.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.378
PHYLLIS.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.879
CAN YOU DO THIS?

04:42.015 --> 04:43.050
YES.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.691
HI, CAN I HELP YOU?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.726
HI, YES, UH,
I'M HOLLY FLAX.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.695
I WAS TOLD TO ASK
FOR MR. FLENDERSON.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.464
AS PART OF MY LAST DAY,

04:56.497 --> 04:58.532
I'M TRAINING THE NEW
HUMAN RESOURCES REP

04:58.566 --> 05:00.568
IN THE WAYS OF THE COMPANY.

05:00.601 --> 05:05.406
AGAIN, THE COMPANY HAS ALLOTTED
FOR THIS TRAINING--ONE DAY.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.509
SO THIS IS H.R.
THIS IS YOUR DESK.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.810
I LOVE THE VIEW.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.746
YEAH, IT'S GREAT,
ISN'T IT?

05:21.722 --> 05:23.424
HEY.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.659
HEY.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.131
WHAT?

05:31.164 --> 05:34.502
GUESS WHO JUST GOT INTO
THE PRATT SCHOOL OF DESIGN.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.704
NO WAY!
WHAT'D I SAY?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.406
I SAID THAT
THEY'D LOVE THOSE SKETCHES.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.708
CONGRATULATIONS.
OH, THANK YOU.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.842
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DOUBTED IT.

05:41.875 --> 05:42.843
BECAUSE I'M SO
CLEARLY AWESOME.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.912
YES.
SO WHEN DO YOU START?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.647
I DON'T KNOW, I DIDN'T
READ IT CAREFULLY.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.449
I JUST SAW "CONGRATULATIONS,"
AND I SKIMMED THE LIST.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.718
I SAW MY NAME, I CAME IN HERE
TO TELL YOU AND GET A SNACK.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.753
WOW. BUSY MORNING.

05:52.786 --> 05:57.725
SO, YOU KNOW, IT MEANS
I HAVE TO GO TO NEW YORK

05:57.758 --> 05:58.959
FOR THREE MONTHS.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.694
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.695
I'LL COME VISIT YOU.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.597
AND YOU'LL VISIT ME.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.065
IT'S ONLY TWO HOURS AWAY.
IT'LL BE FINE.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.034
THAT PART'S GONNA SUCK,
BUT IT'LL BE GREAT.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.502
YEAH, IT SUCKS,
BUT IT'LL BE GREAT.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.803
SEE HOW EASY THAT IS?

06:09.837 --> 06:12.740
OH...
[chuckles]

06:12.773 --> 06:15.743
I WOULDN'T GO IF THINGS
WEREN'T SO SOLID WITH JIM.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.578
AND DOWN THE ROAD,
IF WE HEAVE A FAMILY,

06:17.611 --> 06:19.012
I COULDN'T GO THEN EITHER.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.716
SO THE TIMING'S PERFECT.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.151
AND THAT IS THE FIRST TIME

06:24.184 --> 06:26.987
I'VE EVER USED THE WORD
"PERFECT" IN HERE.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.822
HEY, STANLEY.
HMM?

06:28.856 --> 06:30.090
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO...

06:30.123 --> 06:32.159
(Michael)
TOBY'S REPLACEMENT. UGH.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.161
WOW.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.929
(Dwight)
SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HER?

06:35.963 --> 06:40.000
WELL, WE KNOW THAT TOBY THINKS
SHE'LL BE GREAT.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.470
OH, STRIKE ONE.
I HATE HER ALREADY.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.837
I HATE HER TOO.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.873
WHY DO YOU HATE HER?

06:45.906 --> 06:48.909
BECAUSE SHE...STINKS...

06:48.942 --> 06:55.649
WITH HER WAYS
AND HER...HEAD.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.718
YOU KNOW, DWIGHT,
SOMETIMES...

06:57.751 --> 07:00.721
I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK YOU SAY THINGS

07:00.754 --> 07:02.523
JUST TO AGREE WITH ME.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.591
WOULD THAT BE
SUCH A BAD THING?

07:03.624 --> 07:04.692
YEAH, IT WOULD.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.693
JUST HAVE A THOUGHT.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.727
HAVE AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT!

07:06.760 --> 07:09.663
ALTHOUGH I WILL AGREE

07:09.697 --> 07:11.064
THAT HER HEAD IS WEIRD.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.166
(Michael)
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE NEED TO DO?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.735
WHAT?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.737
WE NEED TO SELL HER
AN ELEVATOR PASS.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.872
BUT OUR ELEVATOR
DOESN'T REQUIRE A PA--

07:18.906 --> 07:20.608
EXACTLY.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.576
A LITTLE OLD-FASHIONED HAZING.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.712
HI, ARE THERE ANY
LOCAL COMPANIES

07:24.745 --> 07:27.014
THAT RENT ANTIGRAVITY MACHINES?

07:27.047 --> 07:29.182
[woman over speaker phone]
ANTIGRAVITY MACHINES?

07:29.216 --> 07:30.250
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.719
WHAT DO THEY DO, EXACTLY?

07:31.752 --> 07:35.689
THEY MAKE YOU FEEL LIGHTER.

07:35.723 --> 07:38.158
ANTIGRAVITY...UM...

07:38.191 --> 07:39.760
ANTIDEPRESSANT?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.530
I COULD PUT YOU THROUGH
TO SOMEONE ON THAT.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.531
OKAY.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.733
[knock on door]
YEAH.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.901
HEY, MICHAEL?
OH, HEY, DO YOU
STILL WORK HERE?

07:47.935 --> 07:49.737
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY REPLACEMENT.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.505
NAH. NO.
I THINK I WILL PASS.
COME ON.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.508
MICHAEL SCOTT,
THIS IS HOLLY.
HI.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.609
HI, YEAH, RIGHT.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.044
OKAY, WELL, THEY HIRED
A FEMALE TOBY.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.045
GOOD FOR THE WORLD.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.613
THANK YOU, GOD,

07:59.647 --> 08:02.149
FOR CREATING TWO OF YOU.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.684
HERE'S HOW THINGS WORK HERE.

08:03.717 --> 08:04.718
MY JOB IS TO MAKE
THE OFFICE FUN.

08:04.752 --> 08:08.121
YOUR JOB IS TO
MAKE THE OFFICE LAME.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.090
AND WE HAVE
AN ETERNAL STRUGGLE,

08:10.123 --> 08:11.725
YOU AND I.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.761
AND ONLY ONE OF US
CAN BE THE WINNER.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.196
SPOILER ALERT--
I'M GONNA WIN.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.932
MAN, SOMEONE DOESN'T
LIKE H.R.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.734
YEAH.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.671
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?
NOTHING.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.173
T--NO, HE TORTURED ME...

08:26.206 --> 08:27.875
WITH HIS AWFULNESS.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.143
YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.579
I NEARLY FELL ASLEEP

08:31.612 --> 08:32.780
WHEN HE GAVE ME A TOUR
OF THE FILES.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.717
UM, WELL, LOOK,

08:36.750 --> 08:38.285
I'LL LET YOU GET BACK
TO WORK.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.853
BUT I REALLY LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU, MR. SCOTT.

08:39.887 --> 08:43.190
Y--YOU CAN--
MICHAEL.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.228
(Michael)
THANKS TO TOBY,
I HAVE A VERY STRONG PREJUDICE

08:48.261 --> 08:49.930
AGAINST HUMAN RESOURCES.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.732
I BELIEVE
THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

08:51.765 --> 08:53.734
A BREEDING GROUND FOR MONSTERS.

08:53.767 --> 08:54.935
WHAT I FAILED TO CONSIDER,
THOUGH,

08:54.968 --> 08:58.606
IS THAT NOT ALL MONSTERS
ARE BAD.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.674
LIKE E.T.

09:00.708 --> 09:04.645
IS HOLLY OUR EXTRATERRESTRIAL?

09:04.678 --> 09:06.747
MAYBE.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.248
OR MAYBE SHE'S JUST

09:08.281 --> 09:10.283
AN AWESOME WOMAN
FROM THIS PLANET.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.954
THE PLEASURE'S
ALL MINE.
OH, THANKS.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.956
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

09:15.989 --> 09:17.791
AND FINDING OUT MORE
ABOUT WHAT YOU DO HERE.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.027
ANY TIME.
WHAT DO YOU DO HERE?

09:23.997 --> 09:25.666
EXCUSE ME.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.001
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THIS WOMAN?

09:28.035 --> 09:30.904
SHE'S ASKING ABOUT STUFF
THAT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.707
WHAT DO I DO?

09:33.741 --> 09:34.942
REALLY, WHAT DO I DO HERE?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.044
I SHOULD HAVE
WRITTEN IT DOWN.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.278
"QUA" SOMETHING.

09:38.311 --> 09:42.182
UH...QUA...QUAR...

09:52.660 --> 09:53.994
NO. WHICH ONE'S KEVIN?

09:58.999 --> 10:01.969
HE'S HERE ON A SPECIAL
WORK PROGRAM.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.971
HE'S SLOW, YOU KNOW,
IN HIS BRAIN.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.106
OH, GOOD FOR YOU GUYS.
YEAH.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.709
HAZING IS A FUN WAY
TO SHOW A NEW EMPLOYEE

10:08.742 --> 10:11.912
THAT SHE IS NOT WELCOME
OR LIKED.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.280
ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT,

10:24.324 --> 10:26.359
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.264
DO YOU WANT AN M&M?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.200
OH, NO, THAT IS SO SWEET.
BUT THANK YOU, THOUGH.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.236
YEAH, I KEEP THEM HERE
AT MY DESK

10:36.269 --> 10:38.238
SO THAT EVERYBODY
DOESN'T TAKE THEM.

10:38.271 --> 10:41.975
WELL, THAT IS A VERY
SAFE PLACE FOR THEM.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.777
YEAH.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.979
(Michael)
HERE SHE IS. HOLLY.

10:46.013 --> 10:50.283
YOU KNOW, IF WE HUNG HOLLY
FROM THE CEILING,

10:50.317 --> 10:52.886
WE'D HAVE TO KISS
UNDERNEATH OF HER.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.822
SO--I KNOW.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.423
SORRY.
QUESTION.

10:56.456 --> 10:59.727

10:59.760 --> 11:02.963
OH...HUH, HUH.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.464
NICE. I'VE NEVER HEARD
THAT ONE BEFORE, ACTUALLY.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.133
THAT'S GOOD.
I BET.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.969
ARE THESE GUYS
BORING YOUR EARS OFF?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.971
NO, NO, I--

11:11.004 --> 11:12.472
WHAT, UH--
WHAT IS YOUR COMMUTE LIKE?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.742
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE

11:14.775 --> 11:15.809
OOH, UH...

11:15.843 --> 11:18.445
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
MAKE YOU A MIX.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.289
IT'S A PHOTO OF EVERYONE
IN THE OFFICE.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.824
SO YOU CAN TAKE IT
TO COSTA RICA.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.225
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE NOT IN IT.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.861
WELL, I WAS TAKING

11:33.894 --> 11:35.963
I LOVE IT.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.030

11:37.064 --> 11:40.801
I WOULD LOVE A PICTURE

11:40.834 --> 11:42.736

11:42.770 --> 11:44.171

11:49.109 --> 11:51.011

11:52.846 --> 11:55.749
NO ONE HAS A CAMERA HERE.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.217
UH...

11:57.250 --> 11:59.086
I'M GONNA--

12:52.039 --> 12:53.506
WHAT ARE THE TWO LEVELS?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.075
THE TWO LEVELS BEING

12:55.108 --> 12:56.176
WELCOME TOO SCRANTON...

12:58.478 --> 13:02.482
OKAY, LET'S START

13:02.515 --> 13:04.985
HEY, WHAT'S THE GROUP

13:05.018 --> 13:06.453
THAT WAS FROM SCRANTON
THAT MADE IT BIG?

13:06.486 --> 13:07.587
WAS THAT U2?
YES.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.990
YOU DON'T LOVE HOLLY.

13:10.023 --> 13:10.991
I THINK I DO.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.292
BUT YOU JUST MET HER.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.594
WELL, IT WAS LOVE
AT FIRST SIGHT.

13:14.627 --> 13:18.531
ACTUALLY, IT WAS--NO.
IT WAS WHEN I HEARD HER VOICE.

13:18.565 --> 13:21.001
IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SEE
WITH MY EARS.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.870
OH OKAY, IT DOESN'T WORK
LIKE THAT.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.172
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
A ROMANTIC.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.007
ACTUALLY, I THINK I AM.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.010
AND I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF EXPERIENCE IN OFFICE ROMANCE.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.278
OH, REALLY?
YEAH.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.013
LIKE, WITH WHO?

13:33.046 --> 13:34.381
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.017
PAM?
YES, WE ARE STILL DATING.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.385
AND GUESS WHAT.
I TOOK IT SLOW.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.153
YEAH, YOU TOOK IT
TOO SLOW.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.189
WELL, WE'RE REALLY HAPPY.

13:42.222 --> 13:46.026
THIS THING WITH HOLLY FEELS
A LOT LIKE LOVE TO ME.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.460
AND THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.896
AND YOU CAN THINK THAT,

13:48.929 --> 13:50.163
BUT YOU DON'T SAY THAT
OUT LOUD.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.531
AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T
SAY IT TO HER.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.934
I DON'T WANT HER
TO GET AWAY.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.068
I KNOW.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.070
HERE, MICHAEL,
YOU CAN COURT HER

13:57.104 --> 13:59.039
AS YOU GET TO KNOW HER,
YOU KNOW?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.607
I MEAN, THE OFFICE IS
A GREAT PLACE FOR THAT.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.010
PAM AND I,

14:03.043 --> 14:04.211
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER
RIGHT OUT THERE.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.313
I MEAN, FIRST TIME
WE JOKED AROUND

14:06.346 --> 14:08.015
WAS AT MY DESK.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.983
AND THE FIRST MEAL
WE EVER HAD

14:10.017 --> 14:13.153
WAS IN THE BREAK ROOM,
ACTUALLY.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.955
WE WERE AT TWO
SEPARATE TABLES AND--

14:14.988 --> 14:16.924
I REMEMBER THAT.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.293
THE FIRST TIME WE KISSED EVEN
WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.997
AND LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT

14:24.031 --> 14:27.267
YOU CAN GET TO KNOW SOMEONE
REALLY, REALLY WELL,

14:27.300 --> 14:30.437
LIKE I DID...
RIGHT HERE AT WORK.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.608
[quietly]
I WAS THINKING...FIREWORKS
FOR THE PARTY.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.210
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:37.244 --> 14:40.013
OH, BOY, I APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP, BUT I CAN'T--

14:40.047 --> 14:41.014
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.315
I JUST MEANT I WANTED TO PAY

14:42.349 --> 14:44.017
TO HAVE FIREWORKS
AT THE PARTY.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.385
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

14:45.418 --> 14:48.188
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
MISS TOBY.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.192
YEP, HE'S A HECK OF A GUY,

14:52.225 --> 14:53.293
AND I THINK WE SHOULD
SEND HIM OFF RIGHT.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.162
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
HERE YOU GO.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.033
REALLY?

15:00.067 --> 15:02.135
WELL, WE ALL WANT
A GOOD PARTY, RIGHT?

15:02.169 --> 15:07.374
I'M GOING TO PROPOSE TONIGHT.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.409
HOLY CRAP!

15:22.589 --> 15:24.091
HEY, KEVIN.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.158
HI.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.460
DO YOU NEED SOME HELP?

15:27.494 --> 15:30.097
I CAN'T DECIDE
WHAT TO GET.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.665
WELL, WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO EAT?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.301
WELL, I LIKE PRETZELS.

15:34.334 --> 15:39.106
BUT...I REALLY LIKE CHIPS.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.440
HMM.

15:40.473 --> 15:44.244
WELL, HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU HAVE THERE?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.646
OKAY, LET'S SEE.

15:46.679 --> 15:50.717
50...OH, THIS IS A BUTTON.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.086

15:53.120 --> 15:56.189
55, 65--OKAY,
YOU HAVE 75 CENTS.

15:56.223 --> 15:59.259
SO THAT MEANS YOU COULD GET

15:59.292 --> 16:02.729
ANYTHING UP ON THE TOP ROW.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.366
HMM...

16:09.136 --> 16:11.771

16:16.143 --> 16:18.245
HEY, RYAN, IT'S JIM.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.113
LOOK, MAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU LATELY,

16:20.147 --> 16:21.548
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
I REALLY DON'T CARE

16:21.581 --> 16:23.283
BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.684
AND I BET YOU THINK
I DON'T CARE ENOUGH

16:24.717 --> 16:26.719
ABOUT THIS JOB
TO ACTUALLY FIGHT BACK,

16:26.753 --> 16:29.122
BUT YOU'RE WRONG,
BECAUSE I DO, AND I WILL.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.191
SO YOU CAN KEEP TRYING
TO PUSH ME OUT OF THIS PLACE,

16:31.224 --> 16:34.194
BUT GUESS WHAT--
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.330
[snaps cell phone shut]

16:37.364 --> 16:38.598

16:57.317 --> 16:59.086
I MEAN, WE HAVE ALREADY
PUT-TOGETHER CHAIRS.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.387

OH, I'M TRYING TO ADJUST
THE LUMBAR SUPPORT

17:03.456 --> 17:05.225
ON TOBY'S CHAIR,

17:05.258 --> 17:08.128
AND THAT MADE THIS UP/DOWN
LEVER THING NOT WORK.

17:08.161 --> 17:11.098

17:11.131 --> 17:14.667

18:52.665 --> 18:54.667
THERE'S PLENTY
OF BASE LAYING LEFT, RIGHT?

18:54.701 --> 18:56.936
HEY. HEY!

18:56.969 --> 18:59.639
YEAH.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.608
HELLO, ANGELA.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.211
PHYLLIS, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.180
COULD I GET A LIST
OF YOUR VENDORS?

19:07.214 --> 19:09.416
I SHREDDED IT.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.417
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

19:10.450 --> 19:11.951
GOSH, I JUST DON'T KNOW.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.453
WHY DO YOU THINK?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.793
SORRY.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.798
WHAT'D YOU GUYS DO?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.400
OH, THERE HE IS.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.469
THOUGHT YOU HAD
GONE HOME ALREADY.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.771
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME
AND COME BACK FOR THE PARTY?

19:31.804 --> 19:37.210
WELL, WE STILL HAVE TO DO
THE EXIT INTERVIEW.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.682
YES, WE DO.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.351
I'LL LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.985
I'VE BEEN VERY MUCH
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS MOMENT.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.488
VERY, VERY MUCH.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.791
I--I HAVE BEEN STEEPED
IN ANTICIPATION.

19:51.824 --> 19:56.896
TOBY HAS BEEN CRUISIN'
FOR A BRUISIN' FOR 12 YEARS,

19:56.929 --> 19:59.832
AND I AM NOW
HIS CRUISE DIRECTOR.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.835
AND MY NAME IS
CAPTAIN BRUISIN'.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.937
WOW, THANKS, MICHAEL.
I DIDN'T EXPECT--

20:04.971 --> 20:08.241
CAN I JUST SAY THAT
OF ALL THE IDIOTS

20:08.275 --> 20:11.911
IN ALL THE IDIOT VILLAGES
IN ALL THE IDIOT WORLDS,

20:11.944 --> 20:14.481
YOU STAND ALONE,
MY FRIEND.

20:14.514 --> 20:15.615
[door opens]
HELLO.

20:15.648 --> 20:16.716
(Michael)
HEY!

20:16.749 --> 20:19.319
HI, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU TOO.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.621
I'M JUST HAVING
A LITTLE EXIT INTERVIEW.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.656
YEAH, I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.492
UM, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS VERY BORING STUFF.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.526
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A TOUR?

20:26.559 --> 20:27.960
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE BALER?

20:27.994 --> 20:30.297
NO, NO, I'LL LOOK
AT IT LATER.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.399
IT'S PART OF MY JOB.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.000
[chuckles]

20:35.935 --> 20:37.970
OKAY.
[clears throat]

20:38.004 --> 20:38.971
DID YOU NEED ME
TO TAKE NOTES?

20:39.005 --> 20:40.773
HI, PAM. STAY.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.241
OKAY.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.913
UM...ALL RIGHT.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.949
WELL THEN,
I WILL PROCEED.

20:49.982 --> 20:53.953
I JUST HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
THAT I WAS GONNA ASK.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.958
UM...

21:01.794 --> 21:04.464
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

21:09.001 --> 21:10.970
I'M TOBY.

21:11.003 --> 21:14.807
YEAH. CORRECT.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.677
UM...

21:17.710 --> 21:20.447
WHAT GIVES--WHAT--

21:20.480 --> 21:21.848
WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT?

21:24.584 --> 21:26.953
UM, I BROUGHT
THE BINDER.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.555
DO YOU WANNA
TAKE A LITTLE LOOK?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.956
SURE, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.057
I'LL TAKE A LITTLE LOOKSIE.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.860
HERE WE GO.
THANK YOU.

21:35.462 --> 21:41.968
"WHAT WOULD YOU IMPROVE
ABOUT DUNDER MIFFLIN?"

21:42.001 --> 21:43.703
THIS PLACE, UM--

21:43.736 --> 21:45.572
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'VE GOT SOME IDEAS.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.974
I'M NOT ASKING IT,
I'M JUST READING IT OUT LOUD.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.676
OH, I'D LIKE TO HEAR
THE ANSWER.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.678
[sighs]

21:51.711 --> 21:53.079
WELL, LET ME SEE.

21:53.112 --> 21:56.349
I WOULD, UH--

22:04.991 --> 22:06.626
[quietly]
I'LL KILL YOU.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.830
I GUESS EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

22:10.863 --> 22:13.766
I MADE IT THIS FAR, RIGHT?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.735
WHAT'S THE POINT?

22:15.768 --> 22:17.537
TOBY, WHY DON'T YOU
OPEN YOUR PRESENT?

22:17.570 --> 22:18.971
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.940
NO, THIS--HEY, HEY, HEY.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.875
THIS MIGHT NOT BE
WHAT I THINK

22:22.909 --> 22:24.911
THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IS IN THERE

22:24.944 --> 22:26.746
BECAUSE THERE ARE
A LOT OF PRESENTS IN MY CAR,

22:26.779 --> 22:28.815
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHICH IS WHICH.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.017
"SUCK ON THIS."

22:33.886 --> 22:34.987
(Michael)
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

22:35.021 --> 22:36.556
(Pam)
MICHAEL...
THAT'S--

22:36.589 --> 22:38.891
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"MICHAEL"?!

22:38.925 --> 22:40.993
THAT'S NOT EVEN
MY HANDWRITING.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.595
[loudly]
HEY!

22:42.629 --> 22:45.064
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?!

22:45.097 --> 22:46.966
WHO THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE HYSTERICAL

22:46.999 --> 22:50.803
TO GIVE TOBY A ROCK
FOR HIS GOING-AWAY GIFT?!

22:50.837 --> 22:51.804
YOU DID.
NO!

22:51.838 --> 22:53.573
YOU MADE ME WRAP IT.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.107
[Michael humming]
I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THE LINE.
I JUST--

22:55.141 --> 22:56.976
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

22:57.009 --> 22:58.010
THAT IS...

23:00.913 --> 23:03.483
A PSYCHE.

23:03.516 --> 23:04.751
PSYCHE.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.520
SO, THAT IS NOT
MY REAL GIFT TO TOBY.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.621
SO WHAT IS YOUR GIFT?

23:08.655 --> 23:10.557
MY GIFT IS
FORTHCOMING, PAM.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.624
WHAT IS IT?

23:13.693 --> 23:16.996
I AM GOING
TO GIVE TOBY...

23:17.029 --> 23:18.064
YOUR WATCH?

23:21.033 --> 23:22.769
YES, I AM.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.605
THAT WAS IT.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.106
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

23:27.139 --> 23:28.975
I JUST KNEW.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

23:29.008 --> 23:30.910
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.646
WELL...
THAT'S MY WATCH.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.181
THANKS. I'M GONNA SET IT
TO COSTA RICA TIME.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.049
HEY, THAT'S GOOD.

23:37.083 --> 23:40.019
(Creed)
HEY, IT'S THE KID.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

23:40.052 --> 23:43.155
HEY...IT'S THE TEMP.
LOOK.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.625
(Dwight)
OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S THE TEMP.

23:45.658 --> 23:46.859
(Pam)
WOW. IS THAT THE POLICE?

23:46.893 --> 23:47.994
(Dwight)
YES.
MM-HMM.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.529
(Oscar)
WELL, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.131
RYAN'S BIG PROJECT
WAS THE WEB SITE,

23:52.164 --> 23:54.867
WHICH WASN'T DOING SO WELL.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.937
SO RYAN, TO GIVE
THE IMPRESSION OF SALES,

23:57.970 --> 23:59.572
RECORDED THEM TWICE.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.008
ONCE AS OFFICE SALES,
AND ONCE AS WEB SITE SALES.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.743
WHICH IS WHAT WE REFER TO
IN THE BUSINESS

24:03.776 --> 24:05.845
AS MISLEADING THE SHAREHOLDERS.

24:05.878 --> 24:09.916
ANOTHER GOOD TERM IS FRAUD.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.652
THE REAL CRIME, I THINK,
WAS THE BEARD.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.657
OH, MY GOD.
RYAN.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.492
OH, MY GOD.

24:19.526 --> 24:22.261
I CANNOT WAIT
TO VISIT RYAN IN PRISON.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.096
I'M GONNA WEAR
MY HOTTEST TRACK SUIT

24:24.130 --> 24:25.231
AND GET MY HAIR DONE.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.799
AND THEN BE, LIKE,
"HI, RYAN."

24:26.833 --> 24:28.134
AND THEN
ALL THE OTHER PRISONERS

24:28.167 --> 24:30.169
ARE GONNA BE LIKE, "DAMN!

24:30.202 --> 24:32.071
"RYAN, YOU GOT A HOT
EX-GIRLFRIEND.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.106
"OOH, I WOULD NEVER HAVE
TREATED HER SO BAD

24:34.140 --> 24:36.676
WHEN I WAS OUTSIDE
OF PRISON."

24:36.709 --> 24:39.045
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND CONNECT ME TO RYAN?

24:39.078 --> 24:40.547
ABSOLUTELY.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.048
[dialing]

24:43.149 --> 24:45.852
[clears throat]

24:45.885 --> 24:48.154
RIGHT TO VOICE MAIL.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.289
HEY, RYAN, IT'S JIM.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.758
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:51.791 --> 24:53.593
TOTALLY DISREGARD
THAT LAST VOICE MAIL

24:53.626 --> 24:56.663
BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY
HAVE YOUR HANDS TIED.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.665
GOOD LUCK.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.667
(Holly)
WHAT'S PROTOCOL ON THIS?

25:00.700 --> 25:04.036
WELL, I NORMALLY
DO NOTHING, I GUESS.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.973
NO, YOU SHOULDN'T--

25:07.006 --> 25:08.675
[knock on door]

25:08.708 --> 25:11.744
MICHAEL,
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:11.778 --> 25:13.546
[strained voice]
I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT MY FRIEND.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.748
AWW, OF COURSE YOU ARE.

25:15.782 --> 25:16.883
JUST--I'M FINE.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.818
I'M HOLDING IT TOGETHER.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.620
I HAVE A BUSINESS TO RUN.
I'M COOL.

25:20.653 --> 25:21.954
NO, HEY, STOP.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.190
YOU CAN LET YOURSELF BE UPSET.
HE'S YOUR FRIEND.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.663
YOU KNOW WHAT
I USUALLY FIND?

25:30.697 --> 25:34.667
(Michael)
HOLLY IS SWEET AND SIMPLE.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.669
LIKE A LADY BAKER.

25:36.703 --> 25:40.673
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED
TO FIND OUT

25:40.707 --> 25:43.275
THAT SHE HAD WORKED
IN A BAKERY BEFORE COMING HERE.

25:43.309 --> 25:47.847
SHE HAS THAT KIND
OF WARMTH.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.083
I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S BAKED
ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.056
(Kevin)
COOL!

25:57.089 --> 25:58.691
A BOUNCY HOUSE!

25:58.725 --> 26:00.660
KEVIN, TAKE YOUR SHOES
OFF FIRST.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.833
NO ANTI-GRAVITY MACHINE,
HUH?

26:06.866 --> 26:08.968
SORRY, MICHAEL.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE REAL.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.336
THE FERRIS WHEEL
IS PRETTY COOL, THOUGH.

26:10.369 --> 26:11.971
WOW.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.006
LOOK AT OUR PARKING LOT.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.776
YEAH, WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT?

26:16.809 --> 26:24.383

26:24.416 --> 26:26.686
(Pam)
IS JIM GONNA PROPOSE TONIGHT?

26:26.719 --> 26:28.621
HE IS, ISN'T HE?

26:28.655 --> 26:30.923
NO, HE'S NOT.

26:30.957 --> 26:32.391
IS HE?

26:32.424 --> 26:34.060
(Holly)
OH, IT WAS
A PRETTY GOOD COMPANY,

26:34.093 --> 26:35.695
BUT I JUST COULDN'T SEE
A FUTURE THERE.

26:35.728 --> 26:38.064
THEY KEPT HIRING
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.833
IT WAS EASY TO GET IN,
BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO RISE UP.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.702
THAT'S WHAT SHE--

26:42.735 --> 26:45.271
A LOT OF PLACES
ARE LIKE THAT.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.707
I THINK IT'S REALLY COOL
YOU HIRED KEVIN.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.342
THANKS.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.678
YOU HAVE IT?

26:51.711 --> 26:53.279
ALMOST.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.684
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.218
PUT IT IN.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.989

27:03.022 --> 27:04.356
[raccoon growls]

27:04.390 --> 27:06.325
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:06.358 --> 27:08.160
(Michael)
WHAT IS THAT?

27:08.194 --> 27:09.395
MOSE!

27:09.428 --> 27:10.863
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?!

27:10.897 --> 27:12.364
N--NOTHING YOU NEED
TO KNOW THE DETAILS OF.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.433
THERE IS A RACCOON
IN THE CAR, DWIGHT!
NO, THERE'S NOT.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.069
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
IT WAS PLAYFUL HAZING.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.872
NO, THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS PLAYFUL HAZING.

27:19.906 --> 27:22.441
DWIGHT, I WANT YOU
TO LOOK AT HOLLY RIGHT NOW.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.177
EVERYBODY, I WANT YOU
TO LOOK AT HOLLY RIGHT NOW.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.780
AND MAYBE IF YOU LOOK AT HER
DEEPLY ENOUGH,

27:27.814 --> 27:29.248
YOU WILL SEE WHAT I SEE
IN HER.

27:29.281 --> 27:32.752
AND THAT IS THAT WE ARE ALL
VERY LUCKY

27:32.785 --> 27:34.821
TO HAVE HER HERE.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.957
HOLLY IS THE BEST THING

27:37.990 --> 27:40.793
THAT HAS HAPPENED
TO THIS COMPANY

27:40.827 --> 27:43.029
SINCE WORLD WAR II.

27:43.062 --> 27:46.866
50 YEARS--
SHE IS THE BEST.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.234
TAKE CARE OF THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

27:48.267 --> 27:51.137
IT'S NOT RABID.
SHH!

BRINGING THAT UP.

MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SAYING THAT.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.247
I FEEL SO WELCOME HERE.
YEAH...

28:05.885 --> 28:08.320
UM...EXCUSE ME.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.159
DID YOU SEE THAT?
DID YOU SEE IT?

28:13.192 --> 28:16.929
DID YOU SEE WHAT--
WOW-WEE!

28:16.963 --> 28:19.832
UHH--WELL, JAN DIDN'T BELIEVE
IN SHOWING AFFECTION,

28:19.866 --> 28:22.769
SO SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO REACT

28:22.802 --> 28:24.303
TO WHEN A GIRL
TOUCHES ME.

OH...
I LIKE IT.

YUP, THIS IS MY CAR.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.931
DO YOU DRIVE
YOUR OWN CAR?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.973
[starts car]

29:01.007 --> 29:03.209
KEVIN...I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.549
[music ends]
ALL RIGHT.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.984
LET'S HEAR IT FOR DARRYL
AND HIS BAND.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.252
[cheers and applause]

29:13.285 --> 29:14.486
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:14.520 --> 29:15.888
LET'S ALSO GIVE A SHOUT OUT
TO PHYLLIS

29:15.922 --> 29:17.824

29:17.857 --> 29:19.458
YAY, PHYLLIS!
[applause]

29:19.491 --> 29:20.559
(Michael)
PROBABLY THE BEST ONE
THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.962
RIGHT?
[cheers and applause]

29:22.995 --> 29:24.797
BUT THE REAL REASON
THAT WE ARE HERE

29:24.831 --> 29:26.933
IS TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO A GUY

29:26.966 --> 29:29.235
WHO WE WILL PROBABLY
NEVER EVER SEE AGAIN.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.804
NOW, A LOT OF YOU KNOW

29:31.838 --> 29:33.139
THAT I AM AN ACCOMPLISHED
SONGWRITER.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.874
SONG PARODY WRITER.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.409
I HAVE DONE THINGS
LIKE, UM, BEERS IN HEAVEN.

29:37.443 --> 29:38.244
(Jim)
CLASSIC.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.912
OR TOTAL ECLIPSE
OF THE FART.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.414
NOT MY FAVORITE, BUT--
I LIKE THAT ONE.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.349
I LOVE TO SING THEM,

29:43.382 --> 29:45.584
BUT I AM NOT GOING TO BE
DOING THAT TODAY.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.954
I AM GOING TO BE DOING
SOMETHING I WROTE

29:47.987 --> 29:49.588
SPECIFICALLY FOR TOBY.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.524
DO YOU KNOW, UM...
GOODBYE STRANGER?

29:52.558 --> 29:54.426

30:08.207 --> 30:09.876

30:12.478 --> 30:14.180
I'M GONNA MISS TOBY.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.324

YOUR PARADISE *

30:25.357 --> 30:26.926
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THIS,

30:26.959 --> 30:28.594
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
HE WAS KINDA CUTE.

30:28.627 --> 30:33.900
* COME TOMORROW

30:33.933 --> 30:37.103

30:59.926 --> 31:01.593
NOT BAD.
OH, HEY.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.429

31:13.639 --> 31:14.640
SORRY.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.643
KEVIN.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.678
KEVIN, WHERE ARE YOU?

31:19.711 --> 31:20.746
YOU MISSED MY SONG, BUDDY.

31:20.779 --> 31:23.349
(Kevin)
YEAH, MICHAEL,
I'M AT GERRITY'S.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.516
YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN HERE.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.585
JUST PAY FOR IT AND WE'LL
REIMBURSE YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK.

31:26.618 --> 31:27.719
NO, I--
I BROUGHT MY MONEY.

31:27.753 --> 31:30.422
MICHAEL, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU NEED TO SEE.

31:30.456 --> 31:31.457
WHAT IS IT?

31:31.490 --> 31:32.691
JUST HURRY.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.660
IS HE OKAY?

31:34.693 --> 31:36.963
YEAH, HE'S AT THE SUPERMARKET.
HE NEEDS ME.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.265
YEAH, WELL, THE PARTY,
DRIVING TO THE SUPERMARKET--

31:39.298 --> 31:40.499
IT WAS A BIG DAY FOR HIM.

31:40.532 --> 31:43.035
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.336
DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.272
I WILL BE BACK
MOMENTARILY.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.940
ALL RIGHT?

31:47.974 --> 31:48.774
[laughs]
NO, YOU CAN--

31:48.807 --> 31:50.342
FINISH YOUR DRINK
AND THEN I'LL--OKAY.

31:50.376 --> 31:51.910
I'LL BE BACK.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.419
(Jan)
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.521
IT WAS GREAT
TO SEE YOU, JAN.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.590
OKAY.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.225
HELLO, JAN.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.360
HELLO...MICHAEL.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.661
WOW, KEVIN, REALLY?

32:09.695 --> 32:11.730
WE'RE--SORRY.

32:11.763 --> 32:12.999
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A PARTY.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.000
IS THIS WHY YOU
CALLED ME DOWN HERE?

32:14.033 --> 32:16.402
YEAH, MICHAEL,
I JUST, UH--

32:16.435 --> 32:19.305
I THINK YOU KIDS HAVE A LOT
TO CATCH UP ON.

32:19.338 --> 32:20.639
OH, OKAY.
YEAH.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.274
THANKS, KEVIN.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.010
UM...

32:28.614 --> 32:32.684
WOW!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

32:32.718 --> 32:33.685
LOOK AT YOU.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.221
[laughs]

32:35.254 --> 32:36.222
ARE YOU NAUSEOUS?
NO.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.257
DO YOU--
DO YOU HAVE CRAVINGS?

32:38.290 --> 32:40.292
YOU NEVER TOUCHED MY PROPECIA
OR MY ACCUTANE, DID YOU?

32:40.326 --> 32:42.528
UH, NO, I DIDN'T...
GOOD. GOOD.
THANK GOD.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.163
'CAUSE THAT'S...
TOUCH THAT.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.431
WOW, I'M SO HAPPY.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.765
I AM SO DELIRIOUSLY HAPPY.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.200
WHY?

32:48.234 --> 32:49.035
BECAUSE YOU'RE PREGNANT.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.103
AND BECAUSE
IT OBVIOUSLY HAPPENED

32:51.137 --> 32:52.138
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER.

32:52.171 --> 32:54.106
AND I AM VERY PROUD--

32:54.140 --> 32:55.107
YEAH, IT DID HAPPEN
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.675
THAT'S TRUE.
UM...

32:56.708 --> 32:59.511
BUT YOU...

32:59.545 --> 33:03.049
ARE NOT...

33:03.082 --> 33:04.750
UH, YOU'RE NOT THE DAD.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.096
YOU CHEATED ON ME...

33:17.129 --> 33:20.699
WHEN I SPECIFICALLY
ASKED YOU NOT TO?

33:20.732 --> 33:22.134
NO, I DID NOT--

33:22.168 --> 33:24.270
I DID NOT CHEAT ON YOU.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.672
I DID NOT.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.208
WELL...OKAY.
YEAH.

33:29.241 --> 33:30.008
SO IT'S NOT MINE,

33:30.042 --> 33:33.045
AND IT'S NOT
SOMEBODY ELSE'S, SO...

33:33.079 --> 33:36.182
I KNOW...

33:36.215 --> 33:38.750
THE WHOLE TOILET SEAT THING
IS A MYTH, SO--

33:38.784 --> 33:41.453
I WENT TO A SPERM BANK.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.255
YOU DID?

33:43.289 --> 33:44.590
UH-HUH.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.058
WHEN WE WERE GOING OUT?

33:46.092 --> 33:47.759
UH, YEAH.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.728
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.698
YOU ALWAYS USED TO BE
VERY CAUTIOUS.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.233
I'D WEAR TWO CONDOMS.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.434
I KNOW.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.768
YOU'D RATHER HAVE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S SPERM

33:56.802 --> 33:57.769
THAN MY SPERM?

33:57.803 --> 33:58.804
NO, NO, NO.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.307
IT'S NOT JUST ANY
SPERM BANK.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.441
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY--

34:02.474 --> 34:05.311
THIS IS A REALLY,
REALLY GREAT PLACE.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.146
IT'S AMAZING, ACTUALLY.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.147
I'M GONNA BRING YOU
THE CATALOGUE.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.315
YOU SHOULD LOOK THROUGH IT.
IT'S--

34:09.348 --> 34:11.250
AND IT'S A FACT,
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO

34:11.283 --> 34:13.685
THAT LITTLE BREAKFAST PLACE
THAT YOU LIKE IN THE CITY

34:13.719 --> 34:15.687
WHERE YOU CAN DRAW
ON THE TABLES.

34:15.721 --> 34:16.722
IHOP.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.257
IHOP.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.826
IF I WAS 22
AND I HAD LOTS OF TIME

34:20.859 --> 34:22.494
TO HAVE LOTS OF CHILDREN,

34:22.528 --> 34:24.363
THEN SURE, LET'S LET MICHAEL
HAVE A SHOT AT ONE OF 'EM.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.099
BUT HONESTLY, I NEED
TO MAKE THIS ONE COUNT.

34:27.133 --> 34:28.734
OH, THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

34:28.767 --> 34:29.801
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.504
I JUST NEEDED TO GET
ALL OF THAT OUT ONTO THE TABLE.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.240
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.175
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING TOMORROW,

34:36.208 --> 34:38.677
BUT I HAVE MY LAMAZE CLASS
IN ALLENTOWN.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.413
AND, UM, YOU COULD COME.

34:41.447 --> 34:45.251
I USUALLY, YOU KNOW,
USE A FOAM NOODLE

34:45.284 --> 34:46.352
INSTEAD OF A PARTNER.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.354
OH.

34:48.387 --> 34:51.123
UM, I'LL--

34:51.157 --> 34:52.558
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.561
OKAY.

34:56.928 --> 35:01.900
MY WHOLE LIFE,
I HAVE KNOWN TWO THINGS.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.204
I LOVE SEX,
AND I WANT TO HAVE KIDS.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.606
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT THOSE TWO THINGS

35:07.639 --> 35:09.208
WOULD GO HAND IN HAND.

35:09.241 --> 35:13.412
BUT NOW I THINK IT MIGHT BE
ONE OR THE OTHER.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.247
[fireworks exploding]
OH, LOOK THEY'RE STARTING.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.217

35:33.532 --> 35:35.667
WELL, I HOPE
YOU HAD FUN TODAY.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.204
'CAUSE YOU'RE NEVER EVER
THROWING A PARTY AGAIN.

36:04.996 --> 36:09.235
I WAS WAITING FOR
THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THIS,

36:09.268 --> 36:12.371
AND I CAN'T THINK
OF A BETTER TIME THAN RIGHT NOW,

[heavy exhale]

37:21.873 --> 37:24.310
I'VE BEEN CARRYING THAT RING
AROUND IN MY WALLET

37:24.343 --> 37:25.977
FOR SIX YEARS.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.647
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN
YOU'RE GONNA MEET THE RIGHT GIRL

37:28.680 --> 37:30.482
AND THE MOMENT'S GONNA
BE RIGHT.

37:30.516 --> 37:33.885
AND TONIGHT,
WITH THE FIREWORKS

37:33.919 --> 37:37.656
AND THE MUSIC
AND EVERYTHING,

37:37.689 --> 37:38.690
IT WAS RIGHT.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.492
CAN I BE YOUR BRIDESMAID?

37:40.526 --> 37:42.994
NO.

37:48.534 --> 37:51.437
WELL...

37:51.470 --> 37:53.972
IT'S MY OWN FAULT.

IT'S GOT A NICE RING

38:09.421 --> 38:11.490
HEY.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.792
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I JUST REALIZED, UH,

38:13.825 --> 38:15.594
I DON'T HAVE A PICTURE

38:30.442 --> 38:32.077
PAM, YOUR SMILE IS WEIRD.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.446
IT'S DIGITAL, SO JUST
TAKE AS MANY AS YOU WANT.

I DON'T KNOW, I JUST--

38:42.954 --> 38:47.393
I REALLY THOUGHT JIM
WAS GONNA PROPOSE TONIGHT.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.597
HEY THERE.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.007
WELL, I CAN SEE ANDY
PROPOSING TO ANGELA.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.775

39:05.511 --> 39:07.145
SO...

39:07.178 --> 39:09.080
YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW,
AFTER ALL THOSE RIBS,

39:09.114 --> 39:11.550
I'M STILL REALLY HUNGRY.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.485
I DON'T KNOW,
I WAS THINKING OF

39:13.519 --> 39:14.953
MAYBE GOING
OFF-CAMPUS SOMEWHERE

39:14.986 --> 39:16.488
AND GETTING SOME DESSERT.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.957
OH, UM, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:18.990 --> 39:21.660

HE PRACTICALLY LIVES THERE.

39:25.163 --> 39:26.598

I MEAN, FIRST DAY'S ARE
ALWAYS THE HARDEST, RIGHT?

39:54.493 --> 39:56.127

40:11.109 --> 40:11.943
HE MIGHT
TAKE SOMETHING.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.779
I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA
TAKE ANYTHING.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.781
OKAY,
