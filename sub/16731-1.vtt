02:44.790 --> 02:47.964
Sir?
I should like to see Miss Usher.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.555
Well, I'm afraid
that's not possible, sir.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.346
Miss Usher
is confined to her bed.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.560
She's ill?
Yes, sir.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.681
Is it serious?
Sir?

02:59.805 --> 03:02.024
My name is Philip Winthrop.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.063
Miss Usher and I
are engaged to be married.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.153
I cannot admit you, sir.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.819
Cannot?
By whose order?

03:09.940 --> 03:11.783
Mr Roderick, her brother.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.653
He has expressly forbidden...
Then I shall speak to him.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.870
I insist you announce me.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.039
Yes, sir.
If you'll just come in.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.423
Your coat, sir.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.351
If you'll just follow me.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.061
Yes? What is it?

03:48.186 --> 03:49.984
Your boots, sir.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.366
What about them?

03:53.483 --> 03:56.362
Do you mind taking them off?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.997
Taking them off?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.749
What on earth for?

04:01.867 --> 04:05.167
I'm sure Mr Roderick
will explain it to you, sir.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.550
A strange request.

04:19.216 --> 04:21.140
This is the first time
I've ever been...

04:50.624 --> 04:52.592
Sir!

04:54.920 --> 04:57.548
If you'd care to put
these on, sir.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.719
Thank you.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.604
Well, if we may go now.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.365
This way, sir.

05:49.558 --> 05:51.401
What is the meaning of this?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.358
I---

05:54.479 --> 05:56.322
This is Mr Winthrop, sir.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.033
How dare you
admit anyone into this house?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.868
WINTHROP:
I insisted, sir.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.579
I felt I had the right.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.870
Well, we can't talk out here.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.664
Please come in.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.548
I gather you know who I am, sir.
If you please...

06:20.672 --> 06:23.551
Mr Winthrop, softly.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.268
An affliction of the hearing.

06:28.388 --> 06:33.235
Sounds of any exaggerated degree
cut into my brain like knives.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.438
My apologies.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.908
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave, Mr Winthrop.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.448
I've come to see Madeline.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.118
That is quite impossible.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.370
She is confined to her bed.

06:52.329 --> 06:56.459
Mr Usher, your sister
and I are betrothed.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.881
It was a mistake.
I don't believe that.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.130
Please don't argue with me, sir.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.679
You must leave this house now.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.559
It is not a healthy place
for you to be.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.022
Mr Usher...

07:14.351 --> 07:18.151
I have ridden all the way
from Boston to see Madeline,

07:18.271 --> 07:20.694
and I do not intend to leave
without seeing her.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.533
Now, if...
WOMAN: Philip!

07:24.861 --> 07:26.989
Madeline.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.209
Madeline, in heaven's name,
you must return to your bed.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.663
Madeline.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.837
You came all the way
just to see me?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.756
Yes, to see you.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.844
Madeline, I must insist.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.883
We shall talk later, Philip.
Mr Winthrop is leaving.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.428
Leaving?
I'm not leaving.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.057
He must stay, Roderick.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.185
Please let him stay, Roderick.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.397
Very well, he will stay.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.196
Now, for pity's sake,
return to your bed.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.975
(FIRE SPITS)

08:39.269 --> 08:40.895
RODERICK: What happened?

08:43.273 --> 08:46.072
I think your fireplace
needs a screen.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.444
Does it?

08:48.570 --> 08:52.541
I was just admiring this painting here.
Is it your own work?

08:53.533 --> 08:57.163
It is.
And you also play this lute?

08:59.456 --> 09:01.174
I do.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.880
Mr Winthrop, are you actually
planning to marry my sister?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.807
Mr Usher,

09:10.592 --> 09:14.062
during the time we spent together in
Boston, it never occurred to me that...

09:15.013 --> 09:17.766
and I dare say to
Madeline either,

09:17.891 --> 09:20.815
that we were not destined
for each other.

09:21.561 --> 09:25.486
When she left me, she said to me,
"I will love you forever."

09:26.024 --> 09:29.745
Does it seem so incredible, then,
that I would want to marry her?

09:29.861 --> 09:32.330
If you only knew how incredible.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.917
And I suppose this...

09:36.993 --> 09:39.166
this vision includes children?

09:39.871 --> 09:42.215
God willing.
God willing!

09:43.208 --> 09:46.462
If you knew the nightmare
you are picturing for me, sir.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.009
Nightmare?
That's what I said.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.930
Why shouldn't Madeline marry
and have children?

09:54.469 --> 09:57.598
Because the Usher line
is tainted, Mr Winthrop.

09:57.722 --> 10:01.022
Tainted, sir?
You saw Madeline and you see me.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.937
We are dying, Mr Winthrop.

10:04.979 --> 10:08.483
As you saw her today,
she is and will remain.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.331
Believe me, sir,
I bear you no malice.

10:16.366 --> 10:20.371
Were things otherwise, I should
welcome you into our family joyously.

10:20.495 --> 10:24.216
But under the circumstances
it is quite impossible.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.712
But why do you assume that...
that you are dying?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.890
There are many reasons.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.134
Pray give me one, then.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.062
Madeline and I
are like figures of fine glass.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.732
The slightest touch
and we may shatter.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.992
Both of us suffer from
a morbid acuteness of the senses.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.654
Mine is the worse
for having existed the longer,

10:53.778 --> 10:56.122
but both of us are
afflicted with it.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.664
Any sort of food more exotic
than the most pallid mash

11:00.785 --> 11:04.289
is unendurable to my taste buds.

11:04.414 --> 11:08.965
Any sort of garment other than
the softest is agony to my flesh.

11:10.253 --> 11:14.258
My eyes are tormented by
all but the faintest illumination.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.019
Odours assail me constantly.

11:19.012 --> 11:23.643
And, as I've said,
sounds of any degree whatsoever

11:23.766 --> 11:25.518
inspire me with terror.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.987
That's why your servant asked
me to remove my boots.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.148
Yes.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.867
And even so,
I could hear your coming.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.204
Every footstep,
every rustle of your clothes.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.915
I could hear your
horse approaching,

11:39.032 --> 11:43.788
hear the clatter of its hooves
across the courtyard, your knock...

11:43.912 --> 11:47.917
The grating of the door bolt
was like a sword stroke to my ears.

11:51.085 --> 11:55.215
I can hear the scratch of rat
claws within the stone wall.

11:56.966 --> 12:03.190
Mr Winthrop, three-quarters of
my family have fallen into madness,

12:03.306 --> 12:07.903
and in their madness have
acquired a superhuman strength,

12:08.811 --> 12:12.111
so that it took the power
of many to subdue them.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.030
Do you not exaggerate, sir?

For her own sake as well as yours,
will you leave now, please?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.076
No, I will not.

of Ushers?

17:13.824 --> 17:15.701
For Madeline's safety.

17:19.247 --> 17:23.377
It was probably the trembling of the house
which caused that chandelier to fall.

22:42.903 --> 22:46.157
Mr Usher, I mean to take her
from this house tomorrow.

22:46.282 --> 22:49.661
I will not argue with you.
Would you leave, please?

22:52.580 --> 22:54.173
PHILIP: It will be all right,
Madeline.

(DOOR SLAMS)

27:40.617 --> 27:42.369
Don't touch her!

27:42.995 --> 27:45.339
You mustn't wake her, sir.

27:49.793 --> 27:53.138
The shock could be very harmful.

27:54.506 --> 27:58.511
How did she get here?
She walks in her sleep, sir.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.266
And then she comes here?

28:03.390 --> 28:06.690
She's obsessed
by thoughts of death.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.483
Poor child.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.902
How long
has she been doing this?

28:11.023 --> 28:14.027
Ever since
her return from Boston, sir.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.945
I'll just take her to her room.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.035
No, I'll...
No, no.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.042
You might awaken her, sir.

28:22.910 --> 28:25.004
Better let me.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.461
I've done it before.

29:03.033 --> 29:06.458
Good morning, Bristol.
Good morning, sir.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.751
Has Miss Madeline
had her breakfast yet?

29:08.872 --> 29:10.840
Oh, no, sir.

29:10.958 --> 29:14.087
I'd like to take a breakfast tray to her.
Very well, sir.

29:14.211 --> 29:17.181
Of course, she doesn't
eat much usually.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.058
Then we'll see to it
that she does eat.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.019
Yes, sir.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.979
Let's see what we have here.
Bread - that's good.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.815
Um... milk, a little fruit.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.230
I'll take it to her, sir.

29:29.351 --> 29:31.570
No, I'll do it.
Yes, sir.

29:31.687 --> 29:36.739
How about some eggs?
Sir, I think perhaps a little gruel.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.860
It's the most that she's ever
eaten in the morning.

29:39.403 --> 29:42.122
Gruel?
Yes, sir.

29:43.365 --> 29:46.118
Oh, yes, her sense of taste.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.957
Well, all right, then.
Hot gruel... for both of us.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.958
Yes, sir.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.640
How long have you been
with the Ushers, Bristol?

30:00.757 --> 30:02.805
Sixty years, sir.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.896
Sixty years!

30:06.013 --> 30:08.391
Ever since I was a boy.

30:09.725 --> 30:13.355
Then, this is as much your house
as it is Mr Roderick's.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.776
And Miss Madeline's, sir.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.779
Not after today.

30:19.526 --> 30:21.528
I'm taking her to Boston with me.

30:23.405 --> 30:25.453
I see.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.839
(RUMBLING)

30:38.628 --> 30:40.551
How long has that been going on?

30:41.256 --> 30:43.884
So long
I'm hardly aware of it anymore.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.683
It's just the settling
of the house.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.522
PHILIP: It can cause this
entire structure to collapse.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.108
And that doesn't worry you?
Oh, no, sir.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.819
If the house dies,
I shall die with it.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.113
Oh, be careful, sir.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.734
It was about to hit you.
It could cause a nasty burn.

31:02.319 --> 31:05.664
It's that fissure.
It causes the entire house to shake.

31:07.324 --> 31:09.122
Yes, sir.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.716
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

31:19.378 --> 31:21.176
Who is it?

31:26.885 --> 31:28.808
Your breakfast, Miss Usher.

31:28.929 --> 31:32.559
Hot gruel and... hot gruel.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.982
It's so dark in here
I can barely see you.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.995
There!

31:45.112 --> 31:46.989
No sunlight.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.250
There'll be sunlight
where we live.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.245
Now...

31:55.831 --> 31:57.629
Good morning.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.095
Good morning.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.223
If he comes in now,
don't be afraid.

32:05.340 --> 32:09.095
He won't come in.
He has to take drugs to sleep.

32:09.219 --> 32:11.142
Oh, I'm sorry.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.479
Well, now...

32:16.017 --> 32:19.317
To fill you with hot gruel
and good cheer.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.698
You're so sweet to me.

32:21.815 --> 32:24.284
Nothing too good
for the future Mrs Winthrop.

32:24.818 --> 32:26.115
Mrs Winthrop...

32:27.446 --> 32:29.198
Open your mouth.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.501
I'm not hungry.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.836
Madeline, I'll have
no scrawny woman in my home.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.923
Open your mouth.
Come on.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.263
Madeline, get ready to leave.

32:45.839 --> 32:48.262
I want to, Philip.
Then you will.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.263
I can't.
Why?

32:53.680 --> 32:56.024
Because very soon
I shall be dead.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.064
I forbid you
to say that ever again.

32:59.186 --> 33:01.814
It's true, Philip.
It is not true, Madeline.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.656
You're full of life.

33:04.566 --> 33:08.537
Look at me, Philip.
Do I look full of life?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.453
I remember you
as you were in Boston.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.621
Do you remember?

33:14.743 --> 33:18.338
You were exuberant. You were
filled with the joy of living.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.927
That's how you'll be again when you
leave here and become my wife.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.759
I wish you could understand.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.510
Then let me understand, Madeline.
Let me, so that I can help you.

33:33.762 --> 33:37.357
Perhaps you'll feel differently
after you've seen.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.688
Careful, darling.

34:36.949 --> 34:40.420
You don't want to go in there.
I want you to see.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.870
Here they all are.
The Ushers.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.924
It's the lack of air in here.

35:31.046 --> 35:33.094
It's the air itself.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.764
Nothing can survive it long.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.978
My great-grandfather.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.701
His wife.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.714

36:21.513 --> 36:23.686

My mother.

This is monstrous!

36:57.716 --> 37:01.061

Your dear brother's?

37:01.177 --> 37:03.350
There's one for him too.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.599
Does that absolve him?

37:07.183 --> 37:09.185
It waits for me.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.608
No, it does not.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.992
They all wait for me.

37:18.445 --> 37:21.119
Oh, Madeline, Madeline,
you must stop this.

37:23.450 --> 37:26.124
Can't you see
what you're doing to yourself?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.712
You don't understand.

37:27.829 --> 37:31.003
I understand, but you must
leave the dead to themselves.

Oh, Madeline,
come away with me now.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.340
(SCREAMS)

37:47.140 --> 37:49.768
What have you done?

37:49.893 --> 37:51.941
Give her to me.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.856
Thank you.
See to the crypt, will you?

38:32.977 --> 38:34.945
Yes, sir.

38:44.614 --> 38:48.084
Well, are you content now,
Mr Winthrop?

38:48.201 --> 38:51.250
It is not I who force her
to live in a cemetery.

38:52.455 --> 38:55.049
Do you think
that I wish her harm?

38:55.834 --> 38:58.337
I think you still
do not understand.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.635
And I think it's time
that you did.

39:06.845 --> 39:09.348
The tarn is very deep.

39:09.472 --> 39:12.271
One of the Usher women
drowned herself in it.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.269
She was never found.

39:15.186 --> 39:19.236
I dare say it's deep enough
to swallow this house entire.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.950
I'm waiting, Mr Usher.

39:21.651 --> 39:24.655
Last night you asked me
about the singular aridity

39:24.779 --> 39:27.783
of the land around this house.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.913
Once this land was fertile.

39:33.037 --> 39:37.713
Farms abounded. Earth yielded
her riches at harvest time.

39:37.834 --> 39:43.591
There were trees and plant life,
flowers, fields of grain.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.388
There was great beauty here.

39:46.050 --> 39:50.226
At that time this water
was clear and fresh.

39:50.346 --> 39:53.976
Swans glided
upon its crystal surface.

39:54.100 --> 39:58.731
Animals came to its bank,
trustingly, to drink.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.735
But this was long before my time.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.414
Why do you tell me these things?

40:08.531 --> 40:13.128
And then something crept
across the land and blighted it.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.794
The trees lost their foliage.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.510
The flowers languished and died.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.263
Shrubs grew brown and shrivelled.

40:25.173 --> 40:28.097
The grain fields perished.

40:29.052 --> 40:33.398
The lakes and ponds
became black and stagnant.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.937
And the land withered
as before a plague.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.981
A plague?

40:42.857 --> 40:44.780
Yes, Mr Winthrop.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.242
A plague of evil.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.365
Anthony Usher.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.834
Thief, usurer...

40:55.286 --> 40:57.254
merchant of flesh.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.797
Bernard Usher.

41:02.585 --> 41:06.180
Swindler, forger,

41:06.297 --> 41:09.096
jewel thief, drug addict.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.764
Francis Usher.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.983
Professional assassin.

41:20.687 --> 41:23.406
Vivian Usher. Blackmailer...

41:24.899 --> 41:27.152
harlot, murderess.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.656
She died in the madhouse.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.085
Captain David Usher.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.795
Smuggler, slave-trader...

41:38.621 --> 41:40.248
mass murderer.

41:41.624 --> 41:47.256
Mr Usher, I don't see that this has
anything to do with Madeline and myself.

41:47.380 --> 41:51.851
I don't believe in the sins of the
fathers being visited upon the children.

41:56.222 --> 41:58.099
You do not, sir?

41:59.308 --> 42:02.403
The House of Usher
seems to you, then, normal?

42:03.646 --> 42:07.367
The house, sir, is neither
normal nor abnormal.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.485
It is only a house.

42:09.610 --> 42:12.159
You are very wrong,
Mr Winthrop.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.250
This house is centuries old.
It was brought here from England.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.745
And with it
every evil rooted in its stones.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.588
You really believe this!

42:23.499 --> 42:27.549
Evil is not just a word,
it is a reality.

42:28.504 --> 42:33.101
Like any living thing, it can be created.
It was created by these people.

42:37.346 --> 42:42.102
The history of the Ushers is a
history of savage degradations.

42:42.226 --> 42:44.900
First in England,
and then in New England.

42:46.022 --> 42:48.650
And always in this house.

42:49.442 --> 42:51.661
Always in this house.

42:52.236 --> 42:55.661
The pall of evil
which fills it is no illusion.

42:55.782 --> 42:57.876
For hundreds of years,

42:57.992 --> 43:01.713
foul thoughts and foul deeds have
been committed within its walls.

43:02.705 --> 43:05.174
The house itself is evil now.

43:06.793 --> 43:10.218
No, I... I cannot believe this.
But you must.

43:11.214 --> 43:14.343
For Madeline's sake,
you must.

43:14.467 --> 43:17.311
Most of all
does this evil reside in her.

43:18.471 --> 43:20.940
And this is your
dreadful secret?

43:21.849 --> 43:23.601
Mr Winthrop,

43:24.560 --> 43:29.031
do you think those coals jumping from
the fire onto you were an accident?

43:29.148 --> 43:32.869
Do you think that chandelier
falling was an accident?

43:32.985 --> 43:35.363
Do you think that falling
casket was an accident?

43:35.488 --> 43:38.287
Are you trying to tell me that the
house made those things happen?

43:38.407 --> 43:39.784
Yes.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.167
Oh, no, sir.
That's ridiculous.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.465
But even if it were true...

43:46.582 --> 43:51.053
even if this house were
full of evil, Madeline is not.

43:51.671 --> 43:54.094
Nor, for all of your talk,
are you.

43:54.215 --> 43:58.220
You cannot take my sister
out of this house.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.267
If she were to wed and
bear children,

44:00.388 --> 44:03.517
the Usher evil would spread anew -
malignant, cancerous.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.985
You are mad. I will not listen to you.
Yes, you will.

44:06.102 --> 44:08.275
No, I will not!

44:08.396 --> 44:11.570
I'll tell you what's evil
in this house, sir. You!

44:11.691 --> 44:15.116
I will not let your sickened
fancies destroy Madeline's life!

44:19.991 --> 44:21.743
She leaves with me today.

44:28.541 --> 44:30.384
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

44:31.460 --> 44:33.337
Who is it?

44:34.964 --> 44:37.342
We're leaving... now.

44:37.758 --> 44:39.760
Philip...
Madeline, you have no other choice.

44:39.886 --> 44:43.015
If you remain here,
this house will destroy you.

44:44.599 --> 44:46.897
Then you know.

44:47.018 --> 44:50.067
Your brother has poisoned you
with his absurdities.

44:50.188 --> 44:54.944
This entire atmosphere of sickness
and disillusion is his doing.

44:58.154 --> 45:02.284
Madeline, there's nothing wrong with you
that leaving this house won't cure.

45:03.409 --> 45:05.377
Do you love me?

45:08.581 --> 45:10.925
You know I do.
Then leave with me now.

45:13.544 --> 45:14.966
I Will.

45:22.094 --> 45:25.519
Pack just a few belongings.
I'll get my things ready.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.268
How will we go?
You'll ride with me.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.110
Later on we'll get a
coach to Boston.

45:31.187 --> 45:33.736
Oh, Philip, can it truly be?

45:33.856 --> 45:37.076
Darling, within an hour
we'll be away from here.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.072

I told you she could
never leave this house.

47:48.199 --> 47:51.248
What did you do to her?
I didn't touch her.

47:51.369 --> 47:53.246
You killed her!

47:53.371 --> 47:55.465
There is no mark on her.

47:56.457 --> 47:58.835
You are the one who killed her.

48:02.254 --> 48:04.131
I...
I told you she was not well,

48:04.256 --> 48:05.508
and yet you persisted.

48:05.633 --> 48:08.933
Her heart could not withstand
the strain you put upon it.

48:09.595 --> 48:11.017
No.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.727
It's no matter now.

48:17.186 --> 48:21.032
At least she has been spared
the agony of trying to escape.

48:39.792 --> 48:42.420
One candle left to burn now...

48:49.176 --> 48:51.270
before the darkness comes.

49:18.456 --> 49:23.929
At least...
she has found peace now.

49:24.879 --> 49:26.597
Has she?

49:28.007 --> 49:30.305
Why do you say that?

49:30.426 --> 49:36.149
Because I do not believe that for
the Ushers there is peace hereafter.

49:36.265 --> 49:39.314
Is there no end to your horrors?

49:40.186 --> 49:42.109
No.

49:42.229 --> 49:44.527
None whatever.

49:44.648 --> 49:46.571
For they are not mine alone.

49:46.692 --> 49:51.664
Mere passage from the flesh
cannot undo centuries of evil.

49:51.780 --> 49:54.329
There can be no peace
without penalty.

49:55.910 --> 49:57.753
Yet you wanted her to die.

49:57.870 --> 50:00.373
Wanted?
Yes!

50:02.917 --> 50:04.885
I did not wish her death.

50:05.586 --> 50:09.341
I only knew it was inevitable,
as my death is inevitable.

50:11.133 --> 50:14.353
Our blight must be removed
from this earth.

50:16.096 --> 50:19.316
What lies beyond
is something else again.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.663
Must you close it now?

50:37.535 --> 50:40.584
She must take her place below
with the rest of the Ushers.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.386
One last look.

50:49.505 --> 50:51.599
I cannot bear to look at her.

51:00.724 --> 51:02.522
I'll carry her with you.

You said catalepsies?
Did I, sir?

No, sir.
