that might be confusing you.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.335
Like what you're looking at
on the computer at...

19:31.337 --> 19:33.255
I wasn't looking at anything.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.095
Okay.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.932
Sex.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.562
There, I said it.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.524
[sighing]

19:53.526 --> 19:56.528
You know
we're made in God's image.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.030
That means your body

20:00.032 --> 20:02.784
is a holy thing

20:02.786 --> 20:05.119
not to be desecrated.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.373
You know what that means?

20:07.457 --> 20:11.249
But, men like you and me

20:11.251 --> 20:13.294
we got thoughts.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.337
We got thoughts that
start to..

20:15.339 --> 20:16.713
[chuckles]

20:16.715 --> 20:18.216
Start to pop into our heads.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.677
You ever get
those thoughts, bud?

20:20.679 --> 20:22.263
Thoughts about girls?

20:23.597 --> 20:24.930
I get it.

20:24.932 --> 20:28.060
I mean, believe it or not,
I was 16 once.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.022
We're in a bit of a pickle,
aren't we?

20:33.525 --> 20:36.859
We got God over here
on this side

20:36.861 --> 20:41.530
and we got a sex-crazed monkey
over here on this side.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.117
You with me so far, bud?

20:44.201 --> 20:45.577
Not really.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.250
Here's the thing.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.256
It's okay to have thoughts.

20:58.508 --> 21:00.882
That's just a fantasy.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.928
God will look the other way.
He's a busy man.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.432
But no pictures.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.310
Got it?

21:12.896 --> 21:16.690
A fantasy's okay,
it's not real. It's just..

21:16.692 --> 21:19.526
It's just monkey stuff.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.404
You can't control what pops
into your head, right?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.865
I mean, what if a thought popped into
your head right now, a bad thought?

21:24.867 --> 21:27.744
Something like,
I don't know..

21:27.746 --> 21:31.291
You know, grabbing one of these,
these tools in here and wham!

21:32.750 --> 21:34.251
You'd never do it in
real life, right?

21:35.461 --> 21:36.794
Never. Hah.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.590
It's just,
just monkey stuff, right?

21:40.592 --> 21:42.469
Yeah, monkey stuff.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.470
Oh..

21:46.472 --> 21:47.557
There.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.225
We did it.

21:51.603 --> 21:54.480
Awkward talk with Dad over.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.983
Car wash.

22:07.618 --> 22:10.161
Can I talk to you
about something?

22:10.163 --> 22:11.953
I told you, I'm busy.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.457
Come on, one minute.

22:21.508 --> 22:25.133
The reason I had that thing that
Amy saw wasn't what you think.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.969
I'm trying not to think
about it.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.930
I don't like that stuff
at all.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.642
It's shown me something,
something bad.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.227
Something that I... I can't
get out of my head.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.478
I... I know it's
probably not true

22:35.480 --> 22:37.854
but I think I just need to talk
to somebody about it because...

22:37.856 --> 22:39.606
I'm gonna stop you right there.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.732
I know where you're
going with this

22:40.734 --> 22:42.276
and I'm not going to
discuss it.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.902
- What?
- It's a sin.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.738
And you have a choice.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.115
- Billy, come on.
- It's a choice.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.535
I'm not even gonna.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.933
The fuck you following me for?

23:56.853 --> 23:59.644
You remember me, right?

23:59.646 --> 24:00.606
Tyler the perv.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.275
How's the perving?

24:05.236 --> 24:08.488
Why are you always reading the
newspaper outside of our church?

24:08.490 --> 24:09.656
I like bad news.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.827
- Okay.
- And I can sit wherever I want.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.537
I thought you people were
supposed to be all friendly

24:17.539 --> 24:18.914
and giving and shit?

24:18.916 --> 24:20.458
No, of..

24:20.460 --> 24:22.045
No, yeah, no.
It's totally fine.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.589
Great.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.924
Hey, um, you know about that
Clovehitch stuff, right?

24:28.926 --> 24:31.594
'Cause I was thinking maybe
I could ask you a few questions

24:31.596 --> 24:33.136
'cause I was on some
bad website and...

24:33.138 --> 24:35.055
Oh, I get it.

24:35.057 --> 24:36.099
[laughing]

24:36.101 --> 24:38.101
You heard that rumor

24:38.103 --> 24:40.853
about me and the five guys
on the football team.

24:40.855 --> 24:43.355
- And you thought that if you...
- No. No, no, no.

24:43.357 --> 24:46.692
It's okay.
I'm a slut, you're a perv.

24:46.694 --> 24:49.277
We were made for each other.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.613
Okay. Cut it out.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.782
So serious.
No one will know.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.619
It's just you and me
down here.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.788
Whip it out.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.333
Let's see what
we're dealing with.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.421
I'm fucking with you!

25:06.423 --> 25:08.631
- No, I know. I really..
- Do you?

25:08.633 --> 25:10.717
Wait. No, no. I really..
I just..

25:10.719 --> 25:13.219
I want to know about Clovehitch.
That's all, really.

25:13.221 --> 25:15.304
Just like the suspects,
and... and how you could

25:15.306 --> 25:16.514
eliminate certain suspects.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.056
Why?

25:18.058 --> 25:20.269
Why do you all of a sudden care
about this stuff?

25:21.395 --> 25:23.103
Are you trying to convert me?

25:23.105 --> 25:25.355
- Or is this for a merit badge?
- No!

25:25.357 --> 25:27.315
No! I..

25:27.317 --> 25:30.277
I don't know.
It's just stuck in my head.

25:30.279 --> 25:32.613
I just went to the memorial
the other day

25:32.615 --> 25:35.699
and I didn't know any of them,
but, still.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.244
I thought maybe talking to you
about it could help

25:38.246 --> 25:39.953
or something.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.788
But I don't know.
It's probably just stupid.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.417
It's not stupid.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.796
Come here after 3:00.

25:49.590 --> 25:50.674
I'll help you.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.259
[sighing]

25:54.261 --> 25:55.512
Bring cookies.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.227
[brakes squeaking]

26:13.405 --> 26:15.238
Can I help you?

26:15.240 --> 26:17.786
Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm looking for Kassi.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.748
I brought cookies.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.670
Kassi, your little friend
is here.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.715
I didn't think you'd show.

26:32.717 --> 26:34.678
Your grandma's interesting.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.386
[scoffs]
She's not my grandma.

26:37.388 --> 26:38.720
Dumbass.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.890
She used to work for the cops.

26:40.892 --> 26:44.604
She made a copy of all their
files and wrote this book.

26:45.855 --> 26:46.897
Sit.

26:53.904 --> 26:57.741
And here's everything
on his ten official victims.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.331
This is victim number eight,
Erica Lytle.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.374
She was a fifth grade teacher.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.546
Clovehitch knew when
she would be alone.

27:11.714 --> 27:13.881
Sorry, it's pretty graphic.

27:13.883 --> 27:16.092
Did they take any
Polaroid pictures?

27:16.094 --> 27:17.554
No, it's all digital. Why?

27:19.013 --> 27:21.555
So this is all the evidence?

27:21.557 --> 27:22.931
There's not much.

27:22.933 --> 27:26.184
No fingerprints, no blood,
no semen, just the rope.

27:26.186 --> 27:29.021
Well, rope fibers.
And this.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.274
Belonged to victim four,
Sasha Peterson.

27:31.276 --> 27:33.942
Found outside First Baptist.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.944
She never went there,
I checked.

27:35.946 --> 27:38.905
So you were staking out
our church to..

27:38.907 --> 27:40.533
What, narrow it down?

27:40.535 --> 27:42.660
Whoever was going back there?

27:42.662 --> 27:45.537
No. Cops already did that.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.748
I'm using the FBI playbook.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.542
I'm gonna catch him using
his weakness.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.251
And what's that?

27:51.253 --> 27:52.961
He's insane.

27:52.963 --> 27:55.506
Every killer has an MO
tied to his psychology.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.758
It's like a fingerprint.
Look.

27:57.760 --> 28:01.679
Same entry points, same
elaborate ropes on the bodies

28:01.681 --> 28:05.350
the clove hitch tied to every
victim's house, his signature.

28:05.352 --> 28:08.769
He's taunting the cops,
using the victims as trophies.

28:08.771 --> 28:11.521
It's meticulous and planned.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.360
I'm gonna use that fingerprint
to connect him to new cases.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.819
I don't think he's
stopped killing.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.073
I think there's more than
ten victims.

28:20.075 --> 28:21.534
But he has stopped.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.828
Serial killers can't stop.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.834
This one, or this one?

28:31.836 --> 28:34.756
This one. Okay.

28:37.008 --> 28:39.760
Ahem! You know, I was thinkin'
of volunteering.

28:41.554 --> 28:42.555
Mm-hmm.

28:43.847 --> 28:46.974
Maybe, uh,
doing some tutoring

28:46.976 --> 28:48.269
during the afternoons.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.978
Where would that be?

28:51.980 --> 28:54.148
Oh, over at St. Joseph's.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.984
I was talkin' to
Billy's friend Martin.

28:56.986 --> 28:58.736
He goes there.

28:58.738 --> 28:59.903
I think you met him
a couple years ago.

28:59.905 --> 29:00.904
He's a really nice guy.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.326
We donated to their food drive,
I think.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.786
Well, that's very
generous of you, Tyler.

29:07.788 --> 29:11.039
But, keep it to afternoons.
Evenings is family time.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.084
Yes, ma'am.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.091
- No!
- Gin.

29:20.093 --> 29:21.883
- No!
- No!

29:21.885 --> 29:23.760
- Cheating!
- How about that?

29:23.762 --> 29:24.845
Again?

29:24.847 --> 29:27.099
Don't hate me
'cause I'm beautiful.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.999
[instrumental music]

30:30.163 --> 30:33.208
You can pull the wool over your
mother's eyes, but not mine.

30:36.544 --> 30:37.919
Who was it you were visiting
when you're supposed

30:37.921 --> 30:39.255
to be tutoring?

30:43.134 --> 30:44.469
[sighing]

30:46.637 --> 30:48.847
My boy's got himself
a girlfriend.

30:50.057 --> 30:51.556
[chuckles]

30:51.558 --> 30:52.601
Oh.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.230
You know about that?

30:58.023 --> 30:59.483
Problem is,
you lied to your mother.

31:01.653 --> 31:03.738
Oh. W... we..

31:04.989 --> 31:07.407
We really just study.
That's all.

31:07.409 --> 31:10.159
Remember what we talked about
before?

31:10.161 --> 31:13.787
No, her grandma's there.
It's... it's not like that.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.748
Yeah, I know.
Tell you what.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.167
Mom doesn't have to know
you're lying

31:18.169 --> 31:19.835
but she needs to
meet this girl.

31:19.837 --> 31:22.838
Invite her over for dinner
tomorrow night.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.257
I don't know if that's
a good idea.

31:24.259 --> 31:27.009
I'll have her make her
a casserole.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.679
Okay. Yes, sir.

31:43.278 --> 31:46.069
Hey, would you want to go to

31:46.071 --> 31:47.698
dinner tonight at my house?

31:49.034 --> 31:50.741
No.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.619
My parents want to meet you.

31:54.497 --> 31:56.916
- Why?
- Um..

31:58.292 --> 32:00.668
They think we're going out
and, uh..

32:00.670 --> 32:01.835
Whoa.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.796
- What?
- Hm?

32:03.798 --> 32:06.132
You know we're not going out,
right?

32:06.134 --> 32:09.384
Yeah, no.
No, of course.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.180
No, no, no. Duh, obviously.
I just thought..

32:12.182 --> 32:14.015
You know, they just..

32:14.017 --> 32:15.557
They know we're hanging out,
and so..

32:15.559 --> 32:17.977
They're not gonna try to convert
me to the ways of Jesus, are they?

32:17.979 --> 32:20.188
The only thing would be don't
talk about Clovehitch

32:20.190 --> 32:23.274
'cause they don't know about
anything like that, but..

32:23.276 --> 32:25.403
I mean,
don't talk about anything.

32:26.528 --> 32:29.031
Great.
I'm definitely coming.

32:31.076 --> 32:34.451
Mmm.
Great tilapia, hon.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.787
So, Kassi,
where do you go to church?

32:36.789 --> 32:39.123
Oh, I don't go to church.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.875
Um, my dad's usually hungover
on Sundays

32:41.877 --> 32:43.210
and my mom left
when I was little.

32:43.212 --> 32:46.881
So, um,
I'm basically an atheist

32:46.883 --> 32:49.134
but I'm considering
getting into Wicca.

32:51.011 --> 32:53.595
Wicca? Wha..
No, I've heard of that.

32:53.597 --> 32:57.100
It... it's not black magic,
it's um..

32:57.102 --> 32:59.102
- A nature-based spiritual...
- Oh, Mom.

32:59.104 --> 33:02.188
- She's... she's just joking.
- Oh, geez.

33:02.190 --> 33:04.231
This family doesn't
have your sense of humor.

33:04.233 --> 33:07.192
Um, she goes to a church
across town.

33:07.194 --> 33:11.113
Kassi, I hear that, um,
you visit an elderly lady?

33:11.115 --> 33:13.199
Um, yeah. She is a retired.
She used to...

33:13.201 --> 33:15.575
That's her grandma.
Mavis, yeah.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.577
She's a retired secretary
at the bank.

Was he this nervous
when he asked you out, Kassi?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.460
Oh, no.
Not at all.

33:25.462 --> 33:28.131
He was real smooth.

33:28.133 --> 33:32.176
Incredible. So smooth, I didn't
realize that he'd asked.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.636
Oh, I think I know exactly
what you mean.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.305
This one over here's
the same way.

to him myself.

outdoor preparedness anymore.

they got badges now for, um

from her again.

that she abandoned us.

and making her cry.

And tying her up,
and putting me in the bathroom.

01:19:00.948 --> 01:19:02.866
And her screams.

I turned on the water
so I didn't have to hear.

01:19:12.252 --> 01:19:15.338

that I heard about Clovehitch..

01:19:17.423 --> 01:19:18.757

But my dad wouldn't listen,
no one would listen.

so, no one's believed me.

it had photos, and jewelry..

01:25:12.404 --> 01:25:14.821
He's gonna see me if we keep
following him around

01:25:14.823 --> 01:25:16.282
in broad daylight.

01:25:17.408 --> 01:25:18.576
[sighing]

01:25:21.203 --> 01:25:24.081
[instrumental music]

01:25:44.226 --> 01:25:45.729
Whose house is that?

01:25:47.146 --> 01:25:48.937
He's probably just working.

01:25:48.939 --> 01:25:50.190
We should go.

01:25:54.069 --> 01:25:56.153
Kassi! Kassi!

01:25:56.155 --> 01:25:58.033
[music continues]

01:26:05.748 --> 01:26:07.625
[dog barking]

01:26:13.422 --> 01:26:16.300
[music continues]

01:26:54.338 --> 01:26:57.216
- Hey, come on.
- Hey.

01:27:05.516 --> 01:27:08.518
He tied this here.
I saw him.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.398
[instrumental music]

01:27:28.664 --> 01:27:30.542
[music continues]

01:27:32.668 --> 01:27:33.961
Tyler.

01:27:35.005 --> 01:27:36.211
Tyler.

01:27:36.213 --> 01:27:39.091
[music continues]

01:27:54.565 --> 01:27:56.982
It's the woman
from the market.

01:27:56.984 --> 01:27:59.862
[music continues]

01:28:17.296 --> 01:28:19.173
[music continues]

01:28:38.275 --> 01:28:39.318
I'll go in with you.

01:28:40.944 --> 01:28:42.237
No.

01:28:43.573 --> 01:28:45.617
I need to talk to him alone.

01:28:49.412 --> 01:28:51.289
[instrumental music]

01:28:59.797 --> 01:29:01.214
Dad?

01:29:01.216 --> 01:29:04.094
[music continues]

01:29:20.568 --> 01:29:22.445
[music continues]

01:29:40.587 --> 01:29:42.465
[music continues]

01:29:57.564 --> 01:29:58.979
Come on.

01:29:58.981 --> 01:30:01.859
[music continues]

01:30:18.835 --> 01:30:20.712
[music continues]

01:30:48.864 --> 01:30:50.742
[music continues]

01:31:08.592 --> 01:31:10.009
[thud]

01:31:10.011 --> 01:31:12.889
[music continues]

01:31:30.364 --> 01:31:32.242
[music continues]

01:31:34.953 --> 01:31:36.830

01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:52.302
[door closes]

01:31:55.890 --> 01:31:58.268
[woman screaming]

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:04.858
[music continues]

01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:09.738
[screaming continues]

01:32:15.659 --> 01:32:17.537
[camera shutter clicks]

01:32:29.966 --> 01:32:31.259
Dad?

01:32:33.511 --> 01:32:35.180
What are you doin' here?

01:32:37.556 --> 01:32:39.016
Is she okay?

01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:41.851
You should be gone.

01:32:41.853 --> 01:32:43.520
[sighing]
Oh, Tyler.

01:32:44.646 --> 01:32:46.565
- You shouldn't see this.
- Dad!

01:32:48.609 --> 01:32:51.318
What did I teach you?

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:55.824
You don't aim a weapon
unless you intend to use it.

01:32:56.993 --> 01:32:58.870
Are you gonna shoot me, bud?

01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:06.169
You have to turn yourself in.

01:33:09.463 --> 01:33:11.505
- Kassi?
- Yeah.

01:33:11.507 --> 01:33:12.550
Go and help her.

01:33:21.059 --> 01:33:23.353
She's manipulating you.

01:33:28.190 --> 01:33:29.483
Bud..

01:33:30.944 --> 01:33:32.654
Bud, listen to me.

01:33:33.697 --> 01:33:35.739
I'd never hurt anyone.

01:33:37.826 --> 01:33:40.619
This, this woman
and I are having an affair.

01:33:42.454 --> 01:33:45.706
We're a little kinky,
that's all.

01:33:45.708 --> 01:33:49.751
I know, I know, this is a lot
for you to take in..

01:33:49.753 --> 01:33:51.713
...but your mother knows
all about this. She and I...

01:33:51.715 --> 01:33:53.548
Are you serious
with this bullshit?

01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:55.717
Bud, if this gets out,
all you're gonna do

01:33:55.719 --> 01:33:58.135
is hurt your mom and Susie.

01:33:58.137 --> 01:33:59.553
I need you to lower your aim.

01:33:59.555 --> 01:34:01.598
Accidents happen.

01:34:06.895 --> 01:34:09.022
It's okay, bud.
It's okay.

01:34:09.024 --> 01:34:10.772
She was gonna hurt somebody.

01:34:10.774 --> 01:34:14.277
You and me,
we know about gun safety.

01:34:14.279 --> 01:34:19.034
Now, I trust you to properly
handle a firearm, but not her.

01:34:26.541 --> 01:34:28.626
I need you
to lower your weapon.

01:34:30.627 --> 01:34:32.711
Let's not become
another bad statistic

01:34:32.713 --> 01:34:34.841
about gun safety.

01:34:36.384 --> 01:34:37.844
Accidents happen.

01:34:44.975 --> 01:34:46.226
Good man.

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.105
I'm very proud of you, bud.

01:34:52.192 --> 01:34:53.484
Very proud.

01:34:55.194 --> 01:34:56.818
You're doin' the right thing.

01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:58.698
[breathes heavily]

01:35:00.783 --> 01:35:02.034
Remember..

01:35:04.787 --> 01:35:06.455
...butt first.

01:35:08.917 --> 01:35:12.545
You used to think
that was so funny.

01:35:14.881 --> 01:35:16.341
Butt first.

01:35:21.261 --> 01:35:22.721
There you go.

01:35:24.765 --> 01:35:25.849
[sighing]

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.979
I'm not mad.

01:35:34.859 --> 01:35:36.569
Just disappointed.

01:35:40.073 --> 01:35:41.157
[gun clicks]

01:35:45.119 --> 01:35:46.621
[gasping]

01:35:48.914 --> 01:35:51.792
[grunting]

01:35:59.426 --> 01:36:02.303
[choking]

01:36:10.854 --> 01:36:12.731
[gasping]

01:36:23.073 --> 01:36:24.951
[Tyler gasping]

01:36:25.784 --> 01:36:27.367
[Tyler coughing]

01:36:27.369 --> 01:36:30.247
[breathing heavily]

01:36:39.173 --> 01:36:40.884
[panting]

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.358
[instrumental music]

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:16.211
[music continues]

01:37:27.514 --> 01:37:30.391
Tyler, hurry up, please.
I can't be late again.

01:37:32.143 --> 01:37:33.228
Okay.

01:37:34.395 --> 01:37:36.271
I want pancakes.

01:37:37.981 --> 01:37:41.733
Well, you're in luck,
because oatmeal is pancakes

01:37:41.735 --> 01:37:43.443
that Big Bird chewed up.

01:37:43.445 --> 01:37:45.823
- Gross.
- Sweetie, please.

01:37:47.367 --> 01:37:49.991
I need you to be a good little
bug for me today, okay?

01:37:49.993 --> 01:37:52.077
[sighing]
Okay, Mom.

01:37:52.079 --> 01:37:53.957
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:37:56.083 --> 01:37:58.084
Tyler!

01:37:58.086 --> 01:37:59.460
I'm coming!

01:37:59.462 --> 01:38:01.339
[music continues]

01:38:08.971 --> 01:38:10.222
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:38:16.438 --> 01:38:19.187
There's an opening
at Billy's uncle's shop.

01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:21.067
I could pick up a few shifts
there next week.

01:38:23.028 --> 01:38:24.904
[telephone ringing]

01:38:28.073 --> 01:38:29.366
Hello?

01:38:30.743 --> 01:38:32.117
Yes, speaking.

01:38:32.119 --> 01:38:34.997
[music continues]

01:38:52.599 --> 01:38:56.017
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:38:56.019 --> 01:38:58.896
[instrumental music]

01:39:15.079 --> 01:39:16.956
[music continues]

01:39:27.091 --> 01:39:29.176
So what should we do now?

01:39:31.095 --> 01:39:32.928
Nothing.

01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:35.015
Police won't connect it
to Clovehitch.

01:39:36.434 --> 01:39:38.728
She never saw his face.

01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:43.066
Yeah.

01:39:49.863 --> 01:39:52.157
This is what you wanted.

01:39:58.122 --> 01:40:03.209
Mommy, I don't wanna go
to bed. Please!

01:40:03.211 --> 01:40:06.923
Please! I want someone to sleep
with me. I don't want..

01:40:19.226 --> 01:40:21.104
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:40:26.275 --> 01:40:28.737
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

01:40:37.871 --> 01:40:40.123
The police wanted
to talk to you.

01:40:44.836 --> 01:40:46.296
I told them no.

01:40:47.713 --> 01:40:49.173
They..

01:40:53.427 --> 01:40:55.512
They don't think
it was an accident.

01:40:59.434 --> 01:41:01.519
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:41:08.275 --> 01:41:09.943
They think s..

01:41:12.322 --> 01:41:14.783
They think
somebody killed him?

01:41:16.201 --> 01:41:18.744
Oh, goodness no.
Tyler, no.

01:41:19.703 --> 01:41:21.206
No, they..

01:41:22.664 --> 01:41:26.375
They think that someone

01:41:26.377 --> 01:41:28.044
as experienced as Don

01:41:28.046 --> 01:41:29.713
wouldn't just..

01:41:32.841 --> 01:41:34.299
Yes, he had his problems

01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:39.097
but... we... dealt
with them together.

01:41:39.099 --> 01:41:41.848
[sobbing]
I told them that.

01:41:41.850 --> 01:41:45.227
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:48.397
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:41:48.399 --> 01:41:49.482
[sobbing]

01:41:49.484 --> 01:41:50.900
It's okay.

01:41:50.902 --> 01:41:52.779
[sobbing]

01:41:55.407 --> 01:41:57.281
It's okay.

01:41:57.283 --> 01:41:58.785
[sobbing]

01:42:02.204 --> 01:42:05.291
Color guard,
post the flag of Troop 22.

01:42:07.711 --> 01:42:11.213
Color guard, post the flag
of the United States of America.

01:42:13.966 --> 01:42:15.426
Color guard, dismissed.

01:42:21.224 --> 01:42:24.101
And now, Mrs. Burnside,
please present the sash.

01:42:40.743 --> 01:42:42.785
I present to you,
the newest inductee

01:42:42.787 --> 01:42:45.245
into the Order of Light,
Tyler Burnside.

01:42:45.247 --> 01:42:47.291
[applauding]

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:01.013
Thank you.

01:43:02.474 --> 01:43:05.641
Normally, the troop leader
would say a few words.

01:43:05.643 --> 01:43:08.520
So, instead, I'd like to say
a few words about him.

01:43:10.273 --> 01:43:12.359
Donald Burnside, my father.

01:43:13.984 --> 01:43:16.237
We all saw different
sides of him.

01:43:17.697 --> 01:43:20.658
To our community,
he was a leader.

01:43:22.077 --> 01:43:24.537
To our family,
he was a provider.

01:43:26.122 --> 01:43:27.999
To me, he was a dad.

01:43:31.418 --> 01:43:34.336
As troop leader,
my father helped many of us

01:43:34.338 --> 01:43:37.507
get our gun safety badges

01:43:37.509 --> 01:43:40.970
which makes his accident
that much more tragic.

01:43:46.393 --> 01:43:51.064
The truth is bad things
happen to good people.

01:43:53.899 --> 01:43:57.026
Our only defense
is to come together

01:43:57.028 --> 01:43:58.320
like we've done tonight.

01:44:14.378 --> 01:44:17.338
That's what my dad taught me

01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:19.300
through how he lived.

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.347
Let's remember that..

01:44:26.349 --> 01:44:29.644
...how he impacted our lives.

01:44:33.648 --> 01:44:36.150
[breathing heavily]

01:44:37.444 --> 01:44:40.321
[instrumental music]

01:44:57.463 --> 01:44:59.341
[music continues]

01:45:09.559 --> 01:45:12.893
Dad, if you can hear me..

01:45:12.895 --> 01:45:15.773
[crickets chirping]

01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:49.390
...I love you.

01:45:56.230 --> 01:45:59.108
