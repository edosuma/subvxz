00:53.859 --> 00:54.859
Feena.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
Bad dream?

01:04.503 --> 01:05.504
Bad memory.

01:07.139 --> 01:08.739
Here.

01:08.740 --> 01:12.143
I brought you some
warm water and weeds.

01:12.144 --> 01:14.445
Not sure if that makes
it a soup or a tea,

01:14.446 --> 01:18.749
but it's packed with
nutrients either way.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.918
Thank you, Abram.

01:20.919 --> 01:24.155
Anything else I can get you?

01:24.156 --> 01:28.692
Another blanket?

01:28.693 --> 01:30.427
A listening ear?

01:30.428 --> 01:32.663
The virus left me
rattled is all.

01:32.664 --> 01:35.166
Bit of a scare, you know?

01:35.167 --> 01:37.369
I'm glad you didn't die
so soon after being reborn.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.272
I'll drink to that.

01:46.912 --> 01:47.812
It's awful.

01:47.813 --> 01:49.213
I know.

01:49.214 --> 01:51.883
I think the weeds are
even worse in a soup.

01:52.117 --> 01:53.784
It's fine.

01:53.785 --> 01:55.386
Thank you.

01:55.387 --> 01:56.721
I'll work on it.

02:15.674 --> 02:17.208
Nice shot!

02:17.209 --> 02:19.477
I wasn't aiming for that one.

02:21.546 --> 02:24.215
You make the bow?

02:24.216 --> 02:25.549
Found it.

02:25.550 --> 02:32.156
Not great, but I've got to give
the settlers credit for trying.

02:32.157 --> 02:36.895
Soup.

02:40.031 --> 02:41.532
No offense to your
cooking, Abram,

02:41.533 --> 02:43.767
but I think the Sparks
gave us these plants

02:43.768 --> 02:45.002
to amuse themselves.

02:45.003 --> 02:47.505
Or they remade us
with faulty taste buds.

02:48.173 --> 02:49.206
Well, with any luck,

02:49.207 --> 02:51.775
I'll find some game and
get us some real food.

02:51.776 --> 02:54.612
You think it's safe to hunt
outside the force field?

02:54.613 --> 02:57.047
I wasn't vegetarian
in my last life.

02:57.048 --> 03:00.185
Not about to start now.

03:02.287 --> 03:04.221
Are there any spices or
anything we could put in here

03:04.222 --> 03:05.423
so it doesn't taste like a...

03:06.124 --> 03:08.325
Wet dog hair?

03:08.326 --> 03:12.062
Maybe the settlers grew
and dried herbs somewhere.

03:12.063 --> 03:14.331
If they have,
I haven't found any,

03:14.332 --> 03:17.902
but I'll keep looking.

03:21.706 --> 03:23.541
Please do.

03:34.552 --> 03:36.954
So, Sparks can make
a human being,

03:36.955 --> 03:39.223
but they can't make a plant
that tastes good?

03:39.224 --> 03:40.525
Apparently.

03:44.095 --> 03:45.329
Come on.

03:45.330 --> 03:47.431
You've been at this place
for a year.

03:47.432 --> 03:48.766
Nothing here that can help?

03:48.767 --> 03:50.801
This facility is vast.

03:50.802 --> 03:52.504
Let's go see.

04:08.420 --> 04:09.987
What's this?

04:09.988 --> 04:13.357
A door.

04:13.358 --> 04:15.526
Why'd the settlers seal it up?

04:15.527 --> 04:18.096
You should open it and find out.

04:25.770 --> 04:27.938
Yeah.

04:27.939 --> 04:29.741
I should.

05:29.901 --> 05:37.901
Duncan, if you can hear me,
please answer.

05:39.444 --> 05:42.380
Please.

06:21.519 --> 06:23.020
Miss Abbington.

06:23.021 --> 06:24.455
Special Agent James Duncan.

06:24.456 --> 06:28.459
I was told that,
that you wanted to see me.

06:28.460 --> 06:29.360
Is that my file?

06:29.361 --> 06:30.994
It's a copy of it, yeah.

06:30.995 --> 06:32.196
Then you know why I'm here.

06:32.197 --> 06:33.931
Actually, no.

06:33.932 --> 06:36.700
See, Correction said that they
released you only an hour ago,

06:36.701 --> 06:39.570
which means that you came
straight here to see me

06:39.571 --> 06:42.039
after six years in prison.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.641
Six years, five months,
fourteen days.

06:44.642 --> 06:46.043
I didn't work your case,
Miss Abbington,

06:46.044 --> 06:48.245
so if you have some sort of
grudge against the Bureau...

06:48.246 --> 06:49.881
Gregory Palmer.

06:53.852 --> 06:54.885
Your accomplice.

06:54.886 --> 06:57.254
We both want to find him.

06:57.255 --> 06:59.456
Maybe I can find him
without your help,

06:59.457 --> 07:01.225
but you sure can't find him
without mine.

07:01.226 --> 07:03.927
I'm not in Cybercrimes,
I'm in Missing Persons.

07:03.928 --> 07:05.863
Well, then, here's a name
you'll remember:

07:05.864 --> 07:07.431
Malcolm Burns.

07:07.432 --> 07:09.066
Went missing seven years ago.

07:09.067 --> 07:11.435
You found his body
and his suicide note.

07:11.436 --> 07:13.570
Yeah.

07:13.571 --> 07:16.473
Yeah, I remember.

07:16.474 --> 07:18.942
He lost his business,
and his pension.

07:18.943 --> 07:21.012
Because of me and
Gregory Palmer.

07:21.946 --> 07:25.249
Your fraud scheme wrecked
Malcolm Burns' life.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.519
Probably the lives of hundreds
of other people as well.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.522
And now you want to catch the
other guy responsible and what,

07:31.523 --> 07:33.056
send me to visit the
victim's family,

07:33.057 --> 07:34.858
give them some sort of closure?

07:34.859 --> 07:35.926
Is that about right?

07:35.927 --> 07:38.595
I'm not proud of what I've done,
Agent Duncan.

07:38.596 --> 07:41.465
I can't set it right.

07:41.466 --> 07:42.866
But maybe I can help.

07:42.867 --> 07:45.068
No, Miss Abbington, you can't.

07:45.069 --> 07:47.037
Whatever fairytale endings
you thought up in prison...

07:47.038 --> 07:49.806
That's exactly what they are.

07:49.807 --> 07:50.807
Fairy tales.

07:51.976 --> 07:54.646
Destroyed lives stay destroyed.

07:55.947 --> 08:01.151
And if you need some sort of
help stomaching your guilt,

08:01.152 --> 08:02.921
I'd suggest you see a therapist.

08:17.001 --> 08:18.436
Hey, Feena.

08:19.704 --> 08:22.039
Ezra, you want to knock, please?

08:22.040 --> 08:24.976
I'm sorry, I didn't see a
"do not disturb" sign anywhere.

08:27.045 --> 08:30.014
So, any progress?

08:31.049 --> 08:33.717
I thought I had it,
and now it won't even turn on.

08:34.652 --> 08:36.653
What's that?

08:36.654 --> 08:37.855
Picked it up in the courtyard.

08:39.123 --> 08:40.325
A glyph from the rings.

08:40.792 --> 08:43.594
That Skin Rider knew
what these symbols mean.

08:43.595 --> 08:45.596
I think the previous
settlers did too.

08:45.597 --> 08:46.797
If they put it on jewelry,

08:46.798 --> 08:49.567
it must have meant
something to them.

08:52.203 --> 08:53.637
I've seen it before.

08:53.638 --> 08:54.805
During the invasion.

08:54.806 --> 08:55.806
Where?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.841
On a box at my parents' cabin.

08:57.842 --> 08:59.343
Did you ask them what it meant?

08:59.344 --> 09:02.179
Never got the chance.

09:02.180 --> 09:04.181
Hey.

09:04.182 --> 09:06.250
I need to show you something.

09:17.528 --> 09:18.996
What's in there?

09:18.997 --> 09:20.664
No idea.

09:20.665 --> 09:23.066
But all three of us should
be here when I open it.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.067
Why?

09:24.836 --> 09:26.903
I don't know.

09:26.904 --> 09:29.840
I just know that's what
we're supposed to do.

09:29.841 --> 09:31.041
Maybe you shouldn't
have uncovered

09:31.042 --> 09:32.910
what the settlers
clearly sealed up.

09:33.111 --> 09:34.378
Maybe we should.

09:34.379 --> 09:35.979
Maybe it'll tell us
what happened to them.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.280
Maybe it's a threat.

09:37.281 --> 09:38.016
It isn't.

09:38.017 --> 09:40.550
How do you know?

09:40.551 --> 09:41.785
I can't explain it.

09:41.786 --> 09:45.288
It's like a calm certainty.

09:45.289 --> 09:47.625
Like something is
pulling us inside.

09:50.995 --> 09:51.995
You don't feel that?

09:51.996 --> 09:52.996
No.

09:54.165 --> 09:56.266
Well, I do.

09:56.267 --> 09:57.402
Wait!

10:08.546 --> 10:10.882
I don't think the
settlers made this.

10:17.455 --> 10:19.123
I think someone
tried to break it.

10:19.924 --> 10:21.025
Hey, don't!

10:24.562 --> 10:26.997
Your parents ever taught you,
"look, but don't touch"?

10:26.998 --> 10:29.399
It's not going to hurt us.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.434
You know what this is?

10:30.435 --> 10:32.102
It's called the Obelisk.

10:32.103 --> 10:33.303
What's it for?

10:33.304 --> 10:34.304
Ask Abram.

10:36.074 --> 10:37.941
Don't look at me.

10:37.942 --> 10:39.210
I don't know what it is.

10:42.980 --> 10:43.980
What is it doing?

10:44.649 --> 10:45.950
Speaking.

11:13.478 --> 11:16.046
He's a brother, Jax,
not an enemy.

11:16.047 --> 11:16.981
He's a deserter.

11:16.982 --> 11:19.583
His companion is sick.

11:19.584 --> 11:20.818
Should we blame him for that?

11:22.553 --> 11:25.089
Give us a moment.

11:30.895 --> 11:33.997
Want some jerky?

11:33.998 --> 11:36.601
Go on, eat.

11:41.139 --> 11:45.442
The humans call our companions
parasites because they believe

11:45.443 --> 11:47.611
that the companion controls us,

11:47.612 --> 11:49.613
that it robs us
of our free will.

11:49.614 --> 11:50.614
Doesn't it?

11:51.482 --> 11:54.184
Were you a perfect person
in your first life?

11:54.185 --> 11:54.986
Of course not.

11:54.987 --> 11:56.787
So you made mistakes.

11:56.788 --> 11:57.988
Decisions you regret.

11:57.989 --> 12:00.057
Everyone makes mistakes.

12:01.626 --> 12:04.094
Were you ever hurt
by those mistakes?

12:04.095 --> 12:06.730
Or hurt by the mistakes
of others?

12:06.731 --> 12:07.731
That's what you get

12:07.732 --> 12:12.135
when you make all your
decisions by yourself.

12:12.136 --> 12:13.136
Pain.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.805
Shame.

12:14.806 --> 12:15.807
Sorrow.

12:16.674 --> 12:21.144
And no one to blame
but yourself.

12:21.145 --> 12:24.514
But with a companion,
you don't have to decide.

12:24.515 --> 12:27.818
It stops us from making
stupid mistakes.

12:27.819 --> 12:33.323
It saves us from
sorrow and pain.

12:33.324 --> 12:35.225
That's freedom, Duncan.

12:35.226 --> 12:38.563
A friend who understands us
and keeps us in perfect harmony.

12:41.232 --> 12:43.033
Why would you want to
run away from that?

12:43.034 --> 12:45.303
Because that isn't freedom.

12:47.605 --> 12:49.173
It's the opposite.

12:56.214 --> 12:57.949
I'm sorry to hear you say that.

12:59.417 --> 13:04.888
What are you going
to do with me?

13:04.889 --> 13:10.761
Heal your companion so
you're no longer confused.

13:15.266 --> 13:17.034
These are the symbols
from the rings.

13:19.203 --> 13:22.807
This is the one you showed me.

13:23.507 --> 13:25.876
If only I knew what it meant.

13:25.877 --> 13:27.577
It means "knowledge."

13:27.578 --> 13:29.179
You knew all along
what those symbols mean

13:29.180 --> 13:30.513
and you didn't say anything?

13:30.514 --> 13:32.082
I don't know what they mean.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.518
I didn't know what that meant
until now.

13:35.286 --> 13:36.586
You guys didn't
feel that either?

13:36.587 --> 13:38.221
What, exactly?

13:38.222 --> 13:40.223
When the glyph appeared
on the surface,

13:40.224 --> 13:43.294
the explanation came into my
head with absolute clarity.

13:44.362 --> 13:47.964
Neither of you experienced that?

13:47.965 --> 13:49.566
Maybe you had to
have touched it.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.269
The Obelisk knows
who's ready to hear it.

13:52.270 --> 13:53.604
So you're saying it chose him?

13:58.576 --> 13:59.609
I don't like this.

13:59.610 --> 14:00.610
Me neither.

14:00.912 --> 14:02.046
Wait, wait.

14:02.747 --> 14:04.282
This might mean something.

14:05.850 --> 14:07.884
Well, whatever it means,
the settlers didn't like it

14:07.885 --> 14:09.586
and I'm guessing we
won't like it either.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.054
The settlers didn't
see this message.

14:11.055 --> 14:11.889
How do you know?

14:11.890 --> 14:13.391
Because it's directed to us.

14:16.427 --> 14:17.460
You're reading this?

14:17.461 --> 14:19.029
Not reading.

14:19.030 --> 14:21.665
I'm not sure if this is an
alphabet or an ideograph

14:21.666 --> 14:22.732
or what.

14:22.733 --> 14:25.068
I don't know where one word ends
and another begins.

14:25.069 --> 14:27.203
I just know it's for us.

14:27.204 --> 14:28.471
You only think you know.

14:28.472 --> 14:31.107
It's teaching me,
telling me what it means.

14:31.108 --> 14:33.043
Please...

14:33.044 --> 14:34.110
Just give me a minute.

14:34.111 --> 14:35.912
It's getting in his head
like a Skin Rider.

14:35.913 --> 14:36.681
Stop touching it!

14:36.682 --> 14:38.214
Feena, please.

14:38.215 --> 14:39.416
You want to back me up?

14:39.417 --> 14:41.885
We need to know whatever the
Obelisk is trying to tell us.

14:41.886 --> 14:43.219
I don't trust this thing.

14:43.220 --> 14:44.888
Me neither.

14:44.889 --> 14:48.159
But I trust Abram.

15:13.284 --> 15:14.018
Abram?

15:14.019 --> 15:16.219
I'm all right.

15:16.220 --> 15:20.690
Just tired all of a sudden.

15:20.691 --> 15:21.659
You see?

15:21.660 --> 15:23.259
I told you this was a bad idea.

15:23.260 --> 15:24.494
I'm fine.

15:24.495 --> 15:25.663
Just give me a sec.

15:33.237 --> 15:34.839
You said it had
a message for us?

15:35.806 --> 15:37.941
It's a contract.

15:37.942 --> 15:41.044
If we do what they ask,
they'll give us more people.

15:41.045 --> 15:42.013
Who's "they"?

15:42.014 --> 15:43.613
Whoever's on the other
end of the Obelisk.

15:43.614 --> 15:44.781
They didn't say.

15:44.782 --> 15:46.450
"Give us more people," like who?

15:47.084 --> 15:49.352
The drones carry
multiple brain states,

15:49.353 --> 15:50.854
not just ours.

15:50.855 --> 15:52.622
Dozens, and their genomes.

15:52.623 --> 15:54.624
So if the drones have
a person's data,

15:54.625 --> 15:56.092
the Sparks can bring them back?

15:56.093 --> 15:57.093
Apparently.

15:57.094 --> 15:58.495
What do they want us to do?

15:58.496 --> 16:01.364
There's a weapon
buried east of here.

16:01.365 --> 16:02.999
They want us to recover it.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.234
Why?

16:04.235 --> 16:06.436
If they told me,
I didn't understand them.

16:06.437 --> 16:07.837
Who do we get to bring back?

16:07.838 --> 16:09.172
Not our choice.

16:09.173 --> 16:10.707
If the Sparks and drones
restore someone,

16:10.708 --> 16:14.144
it'll be because that person has
skills the community needs.

16:14.145 --> 16:15.813
We have to find that weapon.

16:16.414 --> 16:17.680
You're going along
with this now?

16:17.681 --> 16:19.115
Well, that's why
we're here, isn't it?

16:19.116 --> 16:20.517
To restore the human race?

16:20.518 --> 16:22.118
How else are we going to do it?

16:22.119 --> 16:23.920
I'm not starting a family
with either of you.

16:23.921 --> 16:25.188
Usually,

16:25.189 --> 16:26.790
women wait until
I ask before they say,

16:26.791 --> 16:28.391
"Not if you're the
last man on Earth."

16:28.392 --> 16:30.960
Hey, the Skin Riders
are still out there.

16:30.961 --> 16:32.362
If we go outside
that force field,

16:32.363 --> 16:33.696
we endanger ourselves.

16:33.697 --> 16:35.098
And we stay here and do nothing?

16:35.099 --> 16:36.299
What do we accomplish?

16:36.300 --> 16:37.967
We don't have enough food
to feed ourselves,

16:37.968 --> 16:39.335
much less more people.

16:39.336 --> 16:41.137
The Sparks can make
more plants to eat.

16:41.138 --> 16:42.405
More people can hunt.

16:42.406 --> 16:43.940
Do you want a community or not?

16:43.941 --> 16:46.076
And how do we know
that this Obelisk

16:46.077 --> 16:47.677
can keep its side of
the bargain?

16:47.678 --> 16:50.280
It doesn't reconstitute people;
The drones and the Sparks do.

16:50.281 --> 16:51.981
We obey the Obelisk.

16:51.982 --> 16:54.385
So the Obelisk is the boss.

16:55.152 --> 16:56.686
No wonder they
locked it in a room.

16:56.687 --> 16:58.288
It's not our enemy.

16:58.289 --> 16:59.622
You said so yourself, Ezra.

16:59.623 --> 17:01.224
If we're going to restart
the human race,

17:01.225 --> 17:02.992
we need genetic diversity.

17:02.993 --> 17:03.994
That means more people.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.770
So, where exactly
is this weapon?

17:15.873 --> 17:17.807
Yellow has the
weapon's location.

17:17.808 --> 17:19.309
If you don't find it
by nightfall...

17:19.310 --> 17:23.279
We'll head back.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.281
Good luck.

17:52.276 --> 17:54.811
You led Abram to the Obelisk.

17:54.812 --> 17:56.513
You knew it was there.

17:56.514 --> 17:58.615
I didn't make him open the door.

17:58.616 --> 17:59.816
What is that thing?

17:59.817 --> 18:01.251
Is it alive?

18:01.252 --> 18:05.121
It's a communication
device and a shield generator.

18:05.122 --> 18:06.656
So it creates the force field.

18:06.657 --> 18:09.593
It was installed here to
help protect reborn humans.

18:10.361 --> 18:12.529
Then why did the previous
settlers seal it off?

18:12.530 --> 18:13.763
And try to destroy it?

18:13.764 --> 18:15.766
Are you certain
that's what happened?

18:16.834 --> 18:21.171
If it's a communication device,
who are we communicating with?

18:21.172 --> 18:23.373
And if you can speak
in our own language,

18:23.374 --> 18:24.574
why doesn't the Obelisk?

18:24.575 --> 18:27.244
That's a question
for the Obelisk.

18:27.511 --> 18:29.612
Just when I think
you're on our side.

18:29.613 --> 18:31.047
I'm not your drone, Ezra.

18:31.048 --> 18:34.618
It's up to you to decide
if you are on our side.

18:35.719 --> 18:36.786
Whose side?

18:36.787 --> 18:37.921
The Sparks?

18:37.922 --> 18:39.155
The Obelisk?

18:39.156 --> 18:43.193
Those who made the Obelisk and
me and brought the Sparks here.

18:43.194 --> 18:44.794
And who are they?

18:44.795 --> 18:46.462
And where are they?

18:46.463 --> 18:48.899
Less talk, more walk.

18:57.608 --> 18:59.276
Come with me.

19:10.788 --> 19:12.189
Space for one more?

19:15.259 --> 19:17.061
I'm not sparring
with a deserter.

19:18.362 --> 19:19.896
Duncan didn't desert.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.232
His companion is sick.

19:22.233 --> 19:23.800
He's more human than anything.

19:23.801 --> 19:25.636
I'm always happy
to strike a human.

19:27.605 --> 19:29.406
He'll kill you if you
give him the chance.

19:37.581 --> 19:40.650
Perhaps this is why you
went extinct, human.

19:40.651 --> 19:42.453
Poor reflexes.

19:43.120 --> 19:47.191
Down on all fours like
the animal that you are.

19:51.195 --> 19:52.862
There's no sport in this.

19:52.863 --> 19:54.931
If you're going to bleed,

19:54.932 --> 19:57.468
you might as well be
holding a weapon.

20:05.909 --> 20:08.678
Is this what your
first life was like?

20:08.679 --> 20:09.746
Falling?

20:09.747 --> 20:11.282
Losing?

20:41.812 --> 20:44.047
That's enough!

20:44.048 --> 20:46.516
My enhancements to Duncan
were better than I thought.

20:46.517 --> 20:48.385
Otherwise, he couldn't
have beaten you.

20:50.020 --> 20:51.354
Enhancements?

20:51.355 --> 20:52.890
I'll show you how it's done.

20:57.795 --> 20:59.329
I lied to spare you
embarrassment

20:59.330 --> 21:01.531
in front of your men.

21:01.532 --> 21:03.800
There are no enhancements.

21:03.801 --> 21:05.835
I was testing a theory.

21:05.836 --> 21:09.405
How many times has
Duncan beaten you?

21:09.406 --> 21:10.907
Before today, never.

21:10.908 --> 21:15.211
Because you were both equally
united with your companions.

21:15.212 --> 21:18.414
He's a better fighter
because his companion is ill?

21:18.415 --> 21:20.316
Not better, faster.

21:20.317 --> 21:23.186
Our companions bring
many benefits, but...

21:23.187 --> 21:25.321
the price is braintobody
communication

21:25.322 --> 21:27.423
requires a few more steps.

21:27.424 --> 21:29.625
Synapses must pass through
two brains instead of one.

21:29.626 --> 21:31.194
A fraction of a second
difference.

21:31.195 --> 21:33.363
In battle, all the
difference in the world.

21:33.364 --> 21:35.865
So humans will always
have an advantage?

21:35.866 --> 21:40.169
Unless we remove neural
pathways from our human brain

21:40.170 --> 21:43.139
without damaging cognition
or motor function...

21:43.140 --> 21:44.640
We'd remove the delay.

21:44.641 --> 21:47.310
And give greater control
to our companions.

21:47.311 --> 21:50.380
What you're talking about...
It's brain surgery.

21:50.381 --> 21:52.248
On a cellular level.

21:52.249 --> 21:57.453
Beyond our capabilities, yes.

21:57.454 --> 21:59.156
But not beyond a drone's.

22:01.558 --> 22:02.792
Am I wrong, Duncan?

22:02.793 --> 22:06.262
You have more experience
with drones than we do.

22:06.263 --> 22:11.534
They gave us our brain state,
activated our minds.

22:11.535 --> 22:14.637
If anyone can manipulate
our neural pathways,

22:14.638 --> 22:16.873
it's a drone.

22:16.874 --> 22:18.775
Theoretically.

22:18.776 --> 22:19.209
There.

22:19.576 --> 22:20.444
You see?

22:20.445 --> 22:22.044
Yeah.

22:22.045 --> 22:24.747
A theory that we can't pursue.

22:24.748 --> 22:26.349
We don't have a drone.

22:26.350 --> 22:27.350
No.

22:27.718 --> 22:30.053
But I know a few humans who do.

22:36.427 --> 22:39.162
This is the contract?

22:39.163 --> 22:40.563
Yep.

22:40.564 --> 22:42.765
What does this one mean?

22:42.766 --> 22:44.567
No idea.

22:44.568 --> 22:46.536
I'm learning this bit by bit.

22:46.537 --> 22:49.772
Maybe these three together
are one syllable.

22:49.773 --> 22:53.509
Maybe that's how
you write "baa".

22:53.510 --> 22:57.046
How do you know what it means
if you can't read it?

22:57.047 --> 22:58.281
I don't know.

22:58.282 --> 23:00.750
Well, it's a stupid
communication system.

23:00.751 --> 23:01.951
Why show us glyphs at all

23:01.952 --> 23:04.020
if it's going to give you
the meaning anyway?

23:04.021 --> 23:06.923
Because I don't know the
meaning until I see the glyph.

23:06.924 --> 23:07.990
That's reading.

23:07.991 --> 23:09.492
It's not.

23:09.493 --> 23:13.129
Reading is understanding the
mechanics of a language.

23:13.130 --> 23:16.699
How words are formed,
sentences, syntax, structure.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.935
I look at this and
I don't get any of that.

23:18.936 --> 23:20.536
Well, how'd you know
this is for us

23:20.537 --> 23:21.871
and not the previous settlers?

23:21.872 --> 23:23.139
I just know.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.173
That's not good enough.

23:24.174 --> 23:25.808
What if it gives this
feeling to everyone,

23:25.809 --> 23:27.610
even though the message
is hundreds of years old,

23:27.611 --> 23:29.212
so you only think
that it's for us?

23:29.213 --> 23:31.147
Some experiences
can't be explained.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.181
That's a copout.

23:32.182 --> 23:33.316
It's true.

23:33.317 --> 23:36.953
I can't give you an
understanding of my experience.

23:36.954 --> 23:39.589
You have to discover it
for yourself.

23:39.590 --> 23:41.924
So you're saying the Obelisk
will speak with me?

23:41.925 --> 23:43.693
I don't know.

23:43.694 --> 23:44.895
You haven't tried.

23:51.068 --> 23:52.068
I'm getting something.

23:54.304 --> 23:55.471
You are?

23:55.472 --> 23:57.708
It says, "Abram is..."

23:59.576 --> 24:01.310
"Abram is a moron."

24:01.311 --> 24:02.513
Yeah.

24:04.081 --> 24:05.081
Ha.

24:06.183 --> 24:07.584
Don't you have a
drone to repair?

24:09.620 --> 24:10.621
Yeah.

24:11.922 --> 24:14.591
"Abram is a moron."

24:25.936 --> 24:26.936
You.

24:27.437 --> 24:29.338
Hello, Feena.

24:29.339 --> 24:32.141
Red Drone's projecting
holograms again.

24:32.142 --> 24:33.175
I'm not a hologram.

24:33.176 --> 24:34.710
I'm a manifestation of light.

24:34.711 --> 24:36.946
Yeah, yeah, I heard the spiel.

24:36.947 --> 24:38.227
Can the red drone
project Duncan?

24:38.949 --> 24:39.449
Who?

24:39.449 --> 24:40.350
Duncan.

24:40.351 --> 24:41.584
He appeared to me.

24:41.585 --> 24:43.387
He's one of the brain states
in the drone.

24:45.422 --> 24:48.291
The drone is telling me
it's best if I help you.

24:48.292 --> 24:49.292
Help me do what?

24:49.293 --> 24:50.593
Repair the drone.

24:50.594 --> 24:51.594
You and I already tried.

24:51.595 --> 24:52.496
It didn't work.

24:52.497 --> 24:53.930
Red says we should try again.

24:53.931 --> 24:56.666
Look, no offense to you,

24:56.667 --> 24:58.535
but I would work
better with Duncan.

24:59.870 --> 25:02.305
Red thinks that would
be a distraction.

25:02.306 --> 25:04.041
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.654
Looking for someone?

25:18.655 --> 25:20.323
You're a hard person to find.

25:20.324 --> 25:21.525
I prefer not to be found.

25:23.493 --> 25:24.527
I...

25:24.528 --> 25:27.797
I wanted to apologize
for the other day.

25:27.798 --> 25:29.298
I was out of line.

25:29.299 --> 25:30.633
You were trying to do right

25:30.634 --> 25:32.735
and I had no business
discouraging you.

25:32.736 --> 25:34.136
You met the people I stole from.

25:34.137 --> 25:35.304
I wouldn't trust me either.

25:35.305 --> 25:37.773
I also read the rest
of your file.

25:37.774 --> 25:39.942
Said you turned yourself in.

25:39.943 --> 25:42.279
You helped the FBI track down
most of the money.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.715
That's why I only
served six years.

25:45.215 --> 25:47.817
But then why come to me?

25:47.818 --> 25:49.986
Why not go to the agents
assigned to the case?

25:49.987 --> 25:52.922
'Cause you're eager,
smarter than you look...

25:52.923 --> 25:56.626
A departure from the stuffy,
cleanshaven type.

25:56.627 --> 25:58.629
And you're the only person
that would meet with me.

25:59.930 --> 26:01.998
How many agents had
you asked before me?

26:01.999 --> 26:02.999
Nine.

26:03.767 --> 26:06.102
Plus you have access to
the databases I need.

26:06.103 --> 26:09.905
Could hack them,
but trying to stay clean.

26:09.906 --> 26:11.975
You can't hack the FBI.

26:14.444 --> 26:15.679
Have you hacked the FBI?

26:16.046 --> 26:18.949
I like to think of myself
as a different person now.

26:20.684 --> 26:22.284
All right.

26:22.285 --> 26:23.886
But just don't think
that I'm doing this

26:23.887 --> 26:25.888
to help you feel better
about yourself.

26:25.889 --> 26:28.491
I wouldn't want your help
if you were.

26:28.492 --> 26:32.462
I'll contact you.

26:42.072 --> 26:43.272
This is it.

26:43.273 --> 26:45.141
You sure?

26:45.142 --> 26:46.510
Here.

26:51.882 --> 26:52.983
How deep am I going?

26:53.250 --> 26:54.950
Four feet.

26:54.951 --> 26:56.218
Seriously?

26:56.219 --> 26:58.539
This thing couldn't be hidden
in a tree trunk or something?

27:20.477 --> 27:21.544
Don't infect him.

27:21.545 --> 27:22.912
Because he's your brother?

27:22.913 --> 27:25.214
Because we need a human
as a test subject.

27:25.215 --> 27:27.283
And the drone?

27:27.284 --> 27:31.120
As little damage as possible.

27:31.121 --> 27:32.788
You need to fuse
those cells together.

27:32.789 --> 27:33.989
Well, if I do, it's permanent.

27:33.990 --> 27:35.558
He'll lose functionality
on this line.

27:35.559 --> 27:36.792
It's not a critical system.

27:36.793 --> 27:38.127
He says it's okay.

27:38.128 --> 27:39.128
You sure?

27:39.129 --> 27:40.129
Yes.

27:40.130 --> 27:41.797
'Cause it looks like this
line goes to the core,

27:41.798 --> 27:42.998
and if we fire the core,

27:42.999 --> 27:44.433
we're going to lose
brain states.

27:44.434 --> 27:46.235
He says it's fine.

27:46.236 --> 27:47.536
All right.

27:47.537 --> 27:48.672
Your funeral.

27:52.709 --> 27:54.077
Now, that's promising.

27:55.112 --> 27:57.780
He did that before,
and then he lost power again.

27:57.781 --> 27:59.448
He says this time's different.

27:59.449 --> 28:02.118
You know, it would be easier if
I could speak to him directly.

28:02.119 --> 28:03.819
Sorry.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.822
I'm not trying to be annoying.

28:09.292 --> 28:11.127
I'm Lynn, by the way.

28:11.128 --> 28:12.561
Did I tell you that last time?

28:12.562 --> 28:15.766
I didn't ask last time
or this time.

28:20.337 --> 28:21.670
What about you?

28:21.671 --> 28:22.539
Your name, Feena...

28:22.540 --> 28:23.940
Is that short for something?

28:24.908 --> 28:27.243
Sarafeena.

28:27.244 --> 28:28.245
Pretty.

28:32.783 --> 28:34.850
So this man you asked about...
Duncan.

28:34.851 --> 28:36.385
Is he a friend of yours?

28:36.386 --> 28:39.189
No, he's a random stranger.

28:46.396 --> 28:50.566
Yes, he's a friend.

28:50.567 --> 28:51.768
More than that, really.

28:54.004 --> 28:55.805
I hope you find him.

28:55.806 --> 28:58.074
Well, I won't if I can't
fix this piece of junk.

28:59.142 --> 29:00.810
Red can hear you, you know.

29:00.811 --> 29:01.711
Well, I'm not worried

29:01.712 --> 29:03.780
about hurting his little
machine feelings.

29:06.650 --> 29:08.351
What did you say
your name was again?

29:08.752 --> 29:09.819
Lynn.

29:09.820 --> 29:11.153
You married?

29:11.154 --> 29:12.122
Yes.

29:12.122 --> 29:13.122
To Ezra.

29:14.357 --> 29:16.193
Do you know him?

29:21.031 --> 29:23.032
Hello, Duncan.

29:23.033 --> 29:25.234
Did you know that
when a human body

29:25.235 --> 29:30.072
detects a foreign substance,
it rejects it?

29:30.073 --> 29:32.508
A virus, an infection.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.443
Parasite.

29:34.444 --> 29:36.178
Yes.

29:36.179 --> 29:38.047
A parasite.

29:38.048 --> 29:40.115
The body's natural defenses

29:40.116 --> 29:42.084
attack these invaders
relentlessly,

29:42.085 --> 29:44.520
and the body would
attack our companion too,

29:44.521 --> 29:47.756
but the companion tells
the body biochemically,

29:47.757 --> 29:50.359
"You need not hurt me.

29:50.360 --> 29:53.095
"I belong here.

29:53.096 --> 29:54.964
I am one with you."

29:54.965 --> 29:59.235
And the body believes it
because it's true.

29:59.236 --> 30:02.471
But sometimes the body
doesn't listen

30:02.472 --> 30:04.974
and it attacks the companion.

30:04.975 --> 30:08.644
The companion grows ill.

30:08.645 --> 30:15.017
But if the companion dies,
the human dies.

30:15.018 --> 30:20.189
It's better to be dead
than be a slave.

30:20.190 --> 30:22.825
Wrong.

30:22.826 --> 30:25.662
Better to heal the companion
with a drink.

30:29.933 --> 30:32.568
Why would Sparks
heal a parasite?

30:32.569 --> 30:35.304
Because the Sparks
heal all life.

30:35.305 --> 30:38.641
That is their nature.

30:38.642 --> 30:41.911
When an organism
is fully formed,

30:41.912 --> 30:44.747
the Sparks will heal it.

30:44.748 --> 30:49.451
We only have a few left,
but here.

30:49.452 --> 30:51.053
Heal your companion, Duncan.

30:51.054 --> 30:52.522
I would rather die.

30:59.362 --> 31:00.997
I'm afraid that's not an option.

31:19.215 --> 31:21.283
I've got a miracle of
technological engineering

31:21.284 --> 31:23.385
hovering beside me,

31:23.386 --> 31:26.255
and I'm digging a hole
with a glorified spoon.

31:26.256 --> 31:27.423
I would help, but...

31:27.424 --> 31:30.492
Yeah, you don't want to
get your fingernails dirty.

31:30.493 --> 31:33.362
Can't you blast a ray at
the ground or something?

31:33.363 --> 31:35.164
Break up this dirt at least?

31:35.165 --> 31:39.268
You misjudge my capabilities.

31:39.269 --> 31:42.305
A man can dream.

31:46.643 --> 31:49.178
What is this weapon, anyway?

31:49.179 --> 31:50.946
I'm risking my neck for it.

31:50.947 --> 31:52.448
I deserve to know what it is.

31:52.449 --> 31:57.119
I'm not sure of the best
translation... incinerator?

31:57.120 --> 31:58.454
Sounds like nitroglycerin
or something.

31:58.455 --> 31:59.389
Is it?

31:59.390 --> 32:00.789
If I hit it with a shovel,

32:00.790 --> 32:03.192
I'm not going to go up
in a mushroom cloud, am I?

32:03.193 --> 32:04.360
It's not explosive.

32:04.361 --> 32:07.263
It can only be used against
one target on this planet.

32:07.964 --> 32:09.598
That's a relief.

32:09.599 --> 32:12.501
So, what's the target?

32:12.502 --> 32:14.838
It eradicates the Skin Riders.

32:18.174 --> 32:20.209
You didn't say anything
about killing Skin Riders.

32:20.210 --> 32:21.677
Your purpose cannot be achieved

32:21.678 --> 32:23.779
while the Skin Riders
remain a threat.

32:23.780 --> 32:25.080
My brother's a Skin Rider.

32:25.081 --> 32:26.882
I'm not going to keep
digging this weapon up

32:26.883 --> 32:28.684
if you're going to
use it to kill him.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.019
I'm not going to use it.

32:30.020 --> 32:31.153
You are.

32:31.154 --> 32:33.789
And it only affects the Rider...
The parasite.

32:33.790 --> 32:37.126
If we kill the parasite,
will Silas die?

32:37.127 --> 32:38.727
If the only way
to free your brother

32:38.728 --> 32:41.230
is for his human body to die,

32:41.231 --> 32:43.632
what would he want you to do?

32:43.633 --> 32:47.169
If Silas dies, can you and
the Sparks remake him?

32:47.170 --> 32:51.073
That's something that neither
you nor Silas nor I can decide.

32:51.074 --> 32:52.274
Well, who decides?

32:52.275 --> 32:53.275
The deciders.

32:53.610 --> 32:55.712
This hole won't dig itself.

33:02.786 --> 33:05.121
The cheap answer
is his sense of humor.

33:06.289 --> 33:07.289
He has one?

33:08.158 --> 33:10.359
I mean, that's what you say
at dinner parties.

33:10.360 --> 33:13.762
The real reason I love him...

33:13.763 --> 33:15.864
He thinks about other people.

33:15.865 --> 33:19.601
What they need and
what might hurt them.

33:19.602 --> 33:21.937
And then he does all he can
to make them safe.

33:21.938 --> 33:25.175
So he's the only completely
altruistic human who ever lived?

33:25.809 --> 33:29.045
Well, he expects
loyalty and love.

33:30.246 --> 33:31.147
Everyone expects that.

33:31.148 --> 33:32.815
Most don't get it.

33:32.816 --> 33:35.084
We always had his loyalty.

33:35.085 --> 33:36.118
And his love.

33:36.119 --> 33:38.421
So tell me what's
wrong with him.

33:38.988 --> 33:40.156
Nothing.

33:41.624 --> 33:44.260
So, recorded brain states
can lie.

33:46.062 --> 33:48.030
He hates to lose.

33:48.031 --> 33:51.600
He can't stand having
idiots tell him what to do.

33:51.601 --> 33:52.835
And you always have to explain

33:52.836 --> 33:56.171
why you need him
to do something,

33:56.172 --> 34:02.277
and when he loves somebody,
he's terrified of losing them.

34:02.278 --> 34:05.014
Well, I like his weaknesses
better than his virtues.

34:14.357 --> 34:16.126
Thank you, Feena.

34:17.527 --> 34:19.862
You're welcome.

34:26.503 --> 34:28.203
Who has this many aliases?

34:28.204 --> 34:30.473
A man with 14 million
dollars to protect.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.975
Yeah, well,

34:32.976 --> 34:35.177
if I have to look at one more
flight record tonight,

34:35.178 --> 34:38.081
my eyes will melt.

34:39.349 --> 34:41.350
You do know that there are
several people on staff

34:41.351 --> 34:44.119
looking for this guy, right?

34:44.120 --> 34:46.255
I mean, not to mention
the dozen or so agents

34:46.255 --> 34:48.422
from when the case was hot?

34:48.424 --> 34:49.525
He's not a priority.

34:49.525 --> 34:51.426
He gets a cursory look
every now and then.

34:51.427 --> 34:53.795
Come on, the Bureau's not
that inattentive.

34:53.795 --> 34:55.031
Didn't you read the case file?

34:57.100 --> 34:58.534
Yeah.

34:58.535 --> 35:00.669
I stand corrected.

35:00.670 --> 35:03.406
The Bureau is a bunch
of sleeping pandas.

35:07.510 --> 35:10.312
I'm done.

35:10.313 --> 35:11.613
You should take a break too.

35:11.614 --> 35:13.615
There's this new thing
called sleep.

35:13.616 --> 35:14.984
A lot of doctors recommend it.

35:22.392 --> 35:25.527
You know, the one thing
I can't figure is

35:25.528 --> 35:27.996
what did you see in this guy?

35:27.997 --> 35:31.401
I mean, technically,
he's still your fiance.

35:36.973 --> 35:40.108
He was kind to me.

35:40.109 --> 35:41.778
I wasn't used to that.

35:49.552 --> 35:54.356
Just...

35:54.357 --> 35:55.858
You deserve better.

36:14.077 --> 36:15.510
Hello?

36:15.511 --> 36:21.383
Are you still there?

36:21.384 --> 36:24.419
The contract is gone.

36:24.420 --> 36:28.591
And that means something?

36:41.037 --> 36:42.238
Knowledge.

36:44.173 --> 36:45.607
Duty.

36:45.608 --> 36:47.042
Labor.

36:47.043 --> 36:48.777
Creation.

36:48.778 --> 36:51.446
Selfmastery.

36:51.447 --> 36:52.714
Peace.

36:52.715 --> 36:54.016
Community.

36:54.017 --> 36:56.018
Mercy.

36:56.019 --> 36:57.287
Justice.

36:59.555 --> 37:03.292
The glyphs from the rings.

37:03.293 --> 37:05.560
Why are you showing me this?

37:05.561 --> 37:08.831
What are you trying to say?

37:11.401 --> 37:13.201
They're virtues.

37:13.202 --> 37:17.906
Are they important to you?

37:17.907 --> 37:22.078
Is this your religion?

37:26.482 --> 37:31.387
I can feel that you
want me to understand.

37:36.826 --> 37:38.661
But I don't.

38:02.985 --> 38:03.986
Quickly.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.714
What is that?

38:32.715 --> 38:33.949
This?

38:33.950 --> 38:35.585
It's just something I dug up.

39:08.217 --> 39:09.217
Move left.

39:13.856 --> 39:15.223
Tranquilizer.

39:15.224 --> 39:17.159
Considering his size
and body mass,

39:17.160 --> 39:21.096
I estimate we have two minutes
before he regains consciousness.

39:21.097 --> 39:24.132
Grab the weapon.

39:24.133 --> 39:25.534
What did it do to him?

39:25.535 --> 39:26.568
It's technical.

39:26.569 --> 39:27.969
Then be technical.

39:27.970 --> 39:30.338
Pulsed microwaves at
a specific frequency

39:30.339 --> 39:32.574
change the concentration
of neurotransmitters

39:32.575 --> 39:35.177
in the parasite brain
to lethal levels.

39:35.178 --> 39:36.678
So it kills on contact?

39:36.679 --> 39:38.780
That's the defensive
mechanism on the housing.

39:38.781 --> 39:41.550
The weapon inside has
a much larger purpose.

39:41.551 --> 39:42.684
What purpose?

39:42.685 --> 39:44.119
He's starting to move.

39:44.120 --> 39:48.023
I suggest we get going.

39:48.024 --> 39:53.162
It won't harm humans.

40:07.977 --> 40:11.047
Are those the graves of
the previous settlers?

40:13.983 --> 40:15.283
You lied to us.

40:15.284 --> 40:16.818
You said we'd find people here.

40:16.819 --> 40:18.920
I brought you here
believing that was true.

40:18.921 --> 40:21.590
You had to have known that
there was something wrong.

40:21.591 --> 40:26.161
We didn't know why we had
lost contact with the settlers.

40:26.162 --> 40:28.430
So you brought us here
knowing there might be trouble.

40:28.431 --> 40:31.333
I brought you here because
I was ordered to do so.

40:31.334 --> 40:33.502
Because the human race
must thrive.

40:33.503 --> 40:35.270
Why are you so
committed to that?

40:35.271 --> 40:37.172
You and the Obelisk
and the Sparks?

40:37.173 --> 40:38.741
Do you not support the effort?

40:42.011 --> 40:44.479
Ezra believes you withheld
some of our memories.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.714
That true?

40:45.715 --> 40:46.516
Why do you ask?

40:46.517 --> 40:47.582
Because if it's true,

40:47.583 --> 40:50.051
I want to know why I
have the memories I do.

40:50.052 --> 40:51.954
Memories you wish
you didn't have.

40:55.925 --> 40:59.394
All memories, and the lessons
you gain from them,

40:59.395 --> 41:05.233
are critical in shaping
who you are, Feena.

41:05.234 --> 41:06.935
Will you bring back Duncan?

41:06.936 --> 41:09.371
That is not for me to decide.

41:09.372 --> 41:12.607
Will he remember
what I did to him?

41:12.608 --> 41:14.075
If he doesn't remember,

41:14.076 --> 41:18.948
I'm quite sure
you will tell him.

41:23.219 --> 41:25.287
Singapore.

41:25.288 --> 41:26.088
You sure?

41:26.089 --> 41:27.789
I have a colleague there.

41:27.790 --> 41:29.658
He followed Palmer
and took pictures.

41:29.659 --> 41:30.659
It's him.

41:30.660 --> 41:33.028
It's going to be a beast
trying to extradite him.

41:33.029 --> 41:35.096
There's a contact on this drive.

41:35.097 --> 41:36.998
A top field agent at the SID.

41:36.999 --> 41:38.833
He'll help.

41:38.834 --> 41:40.036
Is he a friend of yours?

41:40.836 --> 41:41.837
He owes me a favor.

41:44.540 --> 41:47.509
You know, the FBI has
hired felons before.

41:47.510 --> 41:49.311
I could put in a
good word for you.

41:49.312 --> 41:52.148
Just see that the money
goes where it belongs.

41:53.716 --> 41:55.051
No, wait.

41:56.252 --> 41:56.852
Come on.

41:56.853 --> 41:58.253
No goodbye?

41:58.254 --> 42:00.956
No celebratory moo goo gai pan?

42:00.957 --> 42:02.357
No thanks for the help?

42:02.358 --> 42:03.358
That being said,

42:03.359 --> 42:05.261
you did, you know,
80% of the work.

42:06.762 --> 42:09.298
Eightyfiveish.

42:15.605 --> 42:17.273
Thanks for the help.

43:00.650 --> 43:03.284
I hope that's not poison ivy.

43:03.285 --> 43:05.053
You shouldn't be
outside the barrier.

43:05.054 --> 43:09.457
I'm 40 yards away,
and when I put this in the soup,

43:09.458 --> 43:11.526
it will be worth it.

43:11.527 --> 43:12.927
Is that the weapon?

43:12.928 --> 43:14.230
Come with me to the Obelisk.

43:22.838 --> 43:24.072
Now what?

43:24.073 --> 43:26.141
No idea.

43:26.142 --> 43:27.208
They can send us messages.

43:27.209 --> 43:28.410
Can we send one to them?

43:28.411 --> 43:29.644
I don't know how.

43:29.645 --> 43:30.546
I've asked it

43:30.547 --> 43:32.647
dozens of questions,
but it never answers.

43:32.648 --> 43:35.316
It just keeps showing me
the same ten virtues

43:35.317 --> 43:36.518
over and over again.

43:36.519 --> 43:38.420
What message did
you want to send?

43:38.421 --> 43:40.955
That weapon was designed
to kill Skin Riders.

43:40.956 --> 43:42.557
And I don't want any part of it.

43:42.558 --> 43:44.859
We can't just
defy the Obelisk, Ezra.

43:44.860 --> 43:45.894
We need their help.

43:45.895 --> 43:47.295
We don't even know who they are.

43:47.296 --> 43:48.296
No, but we do know...

43:48.297 --> 43:49.931
They have an agenda, Abram.

43:49.932 --> 43:50.866
Yeah.

43:50.867 --> 43:52.634
One that includes
restoring the human race.

43:52.635 --> 43:53.735
So they say.

43:53.736 --> 43:55.170
We're alive, aren't we?

43:55.171 --> 43:56.371
Three people isn't enough.

43:56.372 --> 43:58.373
Not if we want
genetic diversity.

43:58.374 --> 44:00.442
Not if we want to
increase our chances.

44:00.443 --> 44:02.510
We are an endangered species.

44:02.511 --> 44:05.213
This is the key
to changing that.

44:05.214 --> 44:06.415
He's right, Ezra.

44:11.120 --> 44:12.120
Lynn?

44:15.758 --> 44:16.758
Lynn?

44:24.333 --> 44:26.102
That's a hologram.

44:27.336 --> 44:30.005
Lynn's brain state is
stored in Red Drone.

44:30.906 --> 44:32.707
You knew this?

44:32.708 --> 44:34.543
Feena told me
while you were gone.

44:35.978 --> 44:36.978
They can remake her.

44:38.114 --> 44:40.082
If we comply.

44:42.051 --> 44:44.219
What about my daughter, Kylie?

44:44.220 --> 44:46.287
Do you have her brain state
and DNA too?

44:46.288 --> 44:47.689
Yes.

44:47.690 --> 44:50.892
So you're holding my family
hostage until I do what you say.

44:50.893 --> 44:53.829
Your family is not hostage,
Ezra, if they do not exist.

44:55.097 --> 44:56.565
Ezra doesn't decide for me.

44:57.166 --> 45:00.301
I choose to help the human race,
whatever that takes.

45:00.302 --> 45:02.036
You don't know what
you're promising, Abram.

45:02.037 --> 45:03.538
Here's what I know:

45:03.539 --> 45:04.873
We were dead.

45:04.874 --> 45:06.876
Now we're not.

45:16.986 --> 45:21.956
You're a hard person to find.

45:21.957 --> 45:24.092
He's being extradited
this afternoon.

45:24.093 --> 45:26.060
Direct flight to JFK.

45:26.061 --> 45:28.930
I just, thought you
might want to know.

45:28.931 --> 45:30.031
Four months.

45:30.032 --> 45:31.199
Took you long enough.

45:31.200 --> 45:32.634
We're the government.

45:32.635 --> 45:35.103
The wheels turn
slowly sometimes.

45:35.104 --> 45:36.539
An email would've sufficed.

45:39.041 --> 45:40.743
Not for me.

45:42.444 --> 45:43.611
Can I walk with you?

45:43.612 --> 45:45.613
You don't know where I'm going.

45:45.614 --> 45:48.083
I'll find out when we get there.

45:53.055 --> 45:54.089
If you can keep up.

46:46.775 --> 46:48.777
Brain state recorded.

46:49.305 --> 46:55.797
