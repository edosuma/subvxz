00:00.008 --> 00:03.967
There is somebody
in our town killing people.

00:06.768 --> 00:09.593
Local paper, came out yesterday.

00:09.728 --> 00:12.247
Evidence we found in the newspaper...

00:12.607 --> 00:14.935
Fill out your name and address
on this form.

00:15.122 --> 00:18.138
The handwriting is distinctive
enough to give us grounds

00:18.193 --> 00:19.747
to detain a suspect.

00:19.808 --> 00:20.935
He's lying about something.

00:20.966 --> 00:22.638
Did you notice him locking
the door of his study?

00:22.662 --> 00:24.083
I did.

00:24.243 --> 00:27.160
We need a record of your
whereabouts on Tuesday.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.714
I took out tours.
I can show you ticket stubs.

00:29.777 --> 00:33.222
- Leighton Thomas murdered two men.
- Twenty years ago.

00:33.507 --> 00:34.706
Dolly.

00:34.755 --> 00:36.679
He suffered a cerebral aneurysm.

00:41.219 --> 00:42.186
No!

00:42.805 --> 00:45.179
Jonjo! Oh, no, no no.

01:33.141 --> 01:35.657
I can't believe
this is happening in my town.

01:35.990 --> 01:38.532
If you live long enough,
you see everything.

01:40.001 --> 01:41.241
Well, let's do it.

01:42.521 --> 01:45.336
Blunt instrument.
My guess... some kind of hammer.

01:45.401 --> 01:46.565
Two blows.

01:46.641 --> 01:49.846
Massive trauma to the skull.
Now, I don't know if you've seen this...

01:51.601 --> 01:54.832
When you find the hammer,
there'll be a nick in the face.

01:58.340 --> 02:00.921
- Nicole.
- Leave her alone.

02:04.641 --> 02:06.351
Serial killer.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.758
Why'd we hear that when it's too late?

02:09.913 --> 02:11.153
Why didn't you say?

02:11.241 --> 02:13.156
You should have protected him!

02:13.641 --> 02:15.185
Look at him, Frank.

02:15.521 --> 02:17.241
Look at what you've done to him.

02:19.201 --> 02:20.880
I'm sorry.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.263
Let's give them a moment, Frank, okay?

02:27.761 --> 02:29.698
I'm sorry for your loss.

03:29.561 --> 03:30.915
Jonjo Patterson.

03:31.001 --> 03:34.025
Killed by two hammer blows to the skull.

03:34.201 --> 03:37.525
Very different M.O. to Niall Swift. Why?

03:37.641 --> 03:40.518
The killer goes to the bother of
removing part of Swift's brain,

03:40.573 --> 03:43.120
but Jonjo is dispatched like that.

03:43.241 --> 03:45.940
Does he want us to think there's
more than one person involved?

03:46.001 --> 03:47.987
Maybe there is.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.471
I don't think so.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.833
If anything, he wants us
to experience chaos.

03:51.858 --> 03:52.938
That's useful.

03:53.599 --> 03:55.802
I can only interpret
what's in front of me.

03:55.999 --> 03:59.223
The killer's life was chaos.
Now he's in control.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.350
We need to go back to Petrie's house.
See what's in that locked room.

04:02.412 --> 04:04.600
We also have handwriting that would seem

04:04.678 --> 04:08.004
to put Petrie
at the scene of Swift's murder.

04:08.079 --> 04:10.316
Are there other connections?

04:10.479 --> 04:13.144
Jonjo was almost certainly
killed elsewhere

04:13.199 --> 04:14.824
and dumped in the van.

04:15.019 --> 04:17.029
There's no spatter...

04:17.199 --> 04:19.084
no signs of a struggle.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.435
We do have some positive news.

04:21.567 --> 04:26.119
SOCOs have removed a hair
from the interior roof fabric.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.409
The hair is not Jonjo's.

04:29.599 --> 04:33.041
The van was stolen in Manchester
10 days ago.

04:33.119 --> 04:34.598
The fuel tank was almost full,

04:34.627 --> 04:37.323
so the driver
must have filled up nearby.

04:37.439 --> 04:39.049
I'll check forecourt cameras.

04:39.245 --> 04:43.956
Why are we still waiting for the
search warrant for Dr. Marr's?

04:44.039 --> 04:45.768
I'll talk to the sheriff's office.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.745
Niall Swift's phone records...
Where are they?

04:48.971 --> 04:51.942
Uh, there was a legal problem
with the phone company.

04:52.039 --> 04:54.949
Ask them, "Do they want
to be front-page news tomorrow?"

04:55.079 --> 05:00.254
Dr. Marr sacked Niall Swift two
hours before he was murdered.

05:00.399 --> 05:01.727
Jonjo messaged friends,

05:01.759 --> 05:05.110
saying he knew something
that would put Marr in prison.

05:05.279 --> 05:08.177
So talk to Jonjo's friends,
find out what he knew.

05:08.239 --> 05:10.489
All lines of inquiry must be pursued.

05:10.514 --> 05:11.535
Thank you.

05:28.439 --> 05:30.209
How's it going?

05:34.319 --> 05:36.039
Mum.

05:37.479 --> 05:39.913
Why am I not feeling anything?

05:41.439 --> 05:43.577
You're in shock, darling.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.599
It's okay.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.022
Come on.

05:53.399 --> 05:54.830
I gave a full statement last night.

05:54.879 --> 05:56.718
I don't understand
why I've been told to come back.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.127
Look, you've been asked to come back

05:58.174 --> 06:00.034
because we believe you can help.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.078
I hung around for two hours yesterday.

06:02.079 --> 06:03.103
Sorry.

06:03.128 --> 06:05.268
I mean, one of your students
was murdered.

06:06.401 --> 06:08.239
After you.

06:09.924 --> 06:11.643
Okay. Take a seat there.

06:11.696 --> 06:13.609
D.C.I. Quigley
will be with you in a minute.

06:13.719 --> 06:15.359
Are you gonna be okay?

06:15.439 --> 06:16.874
Mum.

06:16.999 --> 06:18.559
Okay.

06:22.267 --> 06:27.415
So, Evie, how was Jonjo at college?

06:27.999 --> 06:30.725
Did he get on with Mr. Petrie?

06:31.079 --> 06:32.719
Y-Yeah.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.759
You don't sound too sure.

06:36.839 --> 06:38.919
No, Mr. Petrie was cool with him.

06:39.599 --> 06:40.838
Cool as in?

06:40.909 --> 06:43.291
N-Nice.

06:46.399 --> 06:48.333
You were in class with him every day.

06:48.424 --> 06:50.270
What did you see?

06:50.479 --> 06:53.158
Evie, something
you think might be trivial

06:53.159 --> 06:55.319
could actually turn out to be crucial.

06:58.319 --> 07:01.905
He used to call Jonjo
one of the special ones.

07:07.079 --> 07:08.986
Oh, this is mental.

07:09.279 --> 07:10.572
I know, isn't it?

07:10.719 --> 07:12.166
How long's it been?

07:12.319 --> 07:14.806
- 20-odd years.
- At least.

07:15.279 --> 07:16.398
You saw me on the telly?

07:16.439 --> 07:18.280
I saw you on the telly.

07:18.399 --> 07:20.999
I thought to myself,
"That's fucking Dolly."

07:21.959 --> 07:23.159
Unbelievable.

07:24.239 --> 07:26.479
What are you doing, man?
I'm making you a cup of tea.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.785
I'll have them both.

07:29.159 --> 07:31.027
Remember that drink I invented?

07:31.599 --> 07:34.198
Coffee, tea... same mug.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.629
That was the nuts.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.442
So, how did you find me?

07:41.559 --> 07:43.949
Asked a couple of Jocks. Bingo.

07:44.759 --> 07:46.363
And how did you describe me?

07:49.648 --> 07:50.888
Murderer.

07:52.740 --> 07:55.092
Manc lad. Works the boats.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.336
What you getting all serious for?

07:57.559 --> 08:01.242
You do know if they see us
together, we go back inside...

08:01.375 --> 08:02.424
for good.

08:02.953 --> 08:04.282
What about our agreement?

08:04.479 --> 08:05.879
What agreement?

08:07.719 --> 08:09.279
I can't believe you just said that.

08:10.683 --> 08:13.402
We agreed to look out
for each other once we were out.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.767
Yeah, I <i>am</i> looking out for you.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.820
I don't want you to go back in prison.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.954
- Dolly, man, what you on about?
- Don't.

08:21.599 --> 08:22.775
You don't call me that.

08:22.879 --> 08:24.243
Yeah?

08:24.359 --> 08:25.630
What it is now?

08:25.679 --> 08:27.169
Leighton Thomas.

08:27.279 --> 08:28.999
How come you got a new name?

08:29.679 --> 08:31.678
You're gonna tell me
you've changed now, aren't you?

08:31.755 --> 08:33.433
Of course I've changed.

08:33.479 --> 08:35.357
I was 15 when I met you.

08:35.438 --> 08:37.466
You haven't changed that much,
though, have you?

08:37.599 --> 08:39.544
I saw that kid last night.

08:39.989 --> 08:41.802
I saw the damage.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.119
Huh!

08:43.489 --> 08:45.119
Huh!

08:46.239 --> 08:47.959
That was classic Dolly.

08:49.159 --> 08:50.671
No, that wasn't me.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.281
No, I didn't kill anybody.

08:53.359 --> 08:54.851
Dolly.

08:54.959 --> 08:57.012
Now, that's just not true.

09:00.615 --> 09:02.184
Is this gonna take long?

09:02.379 --> 09:03.998
Is that a problem?

09:04.192 --> 09:06.590
I made a statement.
I don't know what I can add to it.

09:06.903 --> 09:08.848
You alleged you found Niall Swift

09:08.919 --> 09:11.114
- at the bottom of Carn Mohr.
- Mm-hmm.

09:11.364 --> 09:13.300
We have evidence
that puts you at the top,

09:13.399 --> 09:15.058
where he was murdered.

09:15.759 --> 09:17.097
What?

09:17.324 --> 09:19.079
Is this your handwriting?

09:24.559 --> 09:26.380
No. It's similar.

09:26.873 --> 09:31.552
This handwriting was lifted from this...

09:31.724 --> 09:34.890
found in the area
Niall Swift was murdered.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.920
Is this from a crossword?

09:43.841 --> 09:45.450
I don't do crosswords.

09:45.879 --> 09:48.411
And I would never buy that paper.

09:51.639 --> 09:55.013
This totally contradicts
what you're saying.

09:55.279 --> 09:57.693
Your handwriting appears to match.

10:01.169 --> 10:04.152
Look, the handwriting
is similar, but it's not mine.

10:05.675 --> 10:08.358
Listen, I am here voluntarily.
I will not be subjected...

10:08.359 --> 10:10.925
Do we have permission
to search your house?

10:11.119 --> 10:12.824
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

10:13.332 --> 10:16.672
<i>Detective Murray,
apply for a warrant right away.</i>

10:16.759 --> 10:18.000
Yes!

10:18.119 --> 10:19.508
I have to go.

10:19.599 --> 10:20.759
Sit down.

10:22.438 --> 10:23.938
Sit down.

10:28.199 --> 10:29.807
Craig Petrie, I'm detaining you

10:29.839 --> 10:34.158
under Section 14 of
the Criminal Procedure Act 1995.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.518
I suspect you of committing an offense

10:36.519 --> 10:38.317
punishable by imprisonment,

10:38.457 --> 10:40.887
namely the murder of Niall Swift.

10:48.799 --> 10:50.705
You can keep me for 12 hours.

10:50.839 --> 10:51.999
Yes.

10:52.799 --> 10:54.541
Could somebody call my wife?

10:54.861 --> 10:57.834
Tell her I'll be home
this evening around...

10:58.199 --> 10:59.967
9:15?

12:07.399 --> 12:12.107
Okay, people, the warrants
for Petrie have come through.

12:12.279 --> 12:14.798
- Yes.
- So, three teams.

12:14.990 --> 12:16.890
- Petrie's house.
- Right.

12:16.968 --> 12:18.598
- Car. Office.
- Yes, ma'am.

12:18.599 --> 12:20.079
Ma'am.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.282
Um, I want in on the house search.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.165
As an observer?

12:29.175 --> 12:30.574
- I'm in.
- Yeah.

12:30.599 --> 12:32.758
Mummy, who is it?

12:36.815 --> 12:38.383
Go to your room.

12:38.519 --> 12:40.234
Now, please.

13:00.959 --> 13:03.974
According to your statement,
the day Jonjo Patterson went missing...

13:04.049 --> 13:07.888
Jonjo? I thought I was here
because of Niall Swift.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.810
There's a locked door back there.

13:11.919 --> 13:13.119
Do you have the key?

13:14.239 --> 13:17.039
Craig has the only copy.
You'll have to ask him.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.479
P.C. Denny?

13:28.472 --> 13:30.038
According to your statement,

13:30.097 --> 13:32.113
your wife dropped you
at college at 8:00 a.m.

13:32.292 --> 13:34.294
Lots of witnesses.
You were there till 5:00.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.293
And then you walked to town
for a meditation session?

13:37.479 --> 13:41.110
Yeah. I run guided meditation
sessions twice a week.

13:43.603 --> 13:46.878
The well-being of the town
is important to me.

14:05.497 --> 14:08.591
A year ago, Jonjo tried
to set fire to a classroom.

14:08.637 --> 14:12.659
The governors wanted to expel
him, but you intervened.

14:12.897 --> 14:14.589
Yeah, that's right.

14:15.097 --> 14:17.214
And you signed the petition.

14:30.548 --> 14:34.310
Was Jonjo one of your special ones?

14:36.737 --> 14:39.036
I think I'd like the duty solicitor.

14:41.622 --> 14:43.073
<i>"At times, I have a strong urge</i>

14:43.128 --> 14:45.257
<i>to do something harmful or shocking."</i>

14:48.010 --> 14:49.479
<i>True.</i>

14:50.468 --> 14:51.667
<i>Okay, Dessie.</i>

14:51.768 --> 14:53.646
<i>This is just about me. Fine.</i>

14:53.716 --> 14:55.880
<i>Have you told anybody this?</i>

14:57.057 --> 14:58.513
<i>I've tried.</i>

14:59.355 --> 15:00.754
<i>But nobody listens.</i>

15:00.982 --> 15:03.921
<i>If I complain,
they'll just increase the dose.</i>

15:04.335 --> 15:06.882
<i>Tell me a little bit more
about your brother.</i>

15:08.726 --> 15:11.109
<i>I know that he had
a hard time at school.</i>

15:11.497 --> 15:13.826
<i>I saw him being beaten up a few times.</i>

16:04.057 --> 16:05.648
So, what did you find?

16:05.719 --> 16:07.508
Anything in the locked room?

16:07.657 --> 16:09.609
Films of him counseling his students.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.117
Isn't that part of his job?

16:12.377 --> 16:14.382
He was intrusive and manipulative.

16:14.457 --> 16:17.062
This man really loves to play God.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.417
Is that it?

16:19.657 --> 16:21.321
He fits the profile...

16:21.577 --> 16:24.571
the need for control, admiration.

16:25.063 --> 16:27.985
I.Q. of 142. A first at Oxford.

16:28.177 --> 16:30.360
Why's he working
in some shitty little college?

16:30.864 --> 16:32.896
Because no one will challenge him.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.457
Classic narcissist.

16:34.497 --> 16:36.114
Like most men.

16:36.857 --> 16:39.114
Narcissism stems from childhood trauma.

16:39.473 --> 16:41.137
Let me expose that.

16:41.377 --> 16:42.632
You'll see his true face.

16:42.715 --> 16:44.936
No, no. We stick with the plan.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.176
We expose the inconsistencies
in his statement

16:47.177 --> 16:49.096
and break him down
with the evidence we've got.

16:49.097 --> 16:51.737
We haven't got time for that.
He'll sit you out.

16:57.937 --> 16:59.696
Thought I'd make a bit of lunch.

16:59.913 --> 17:01.076
Doing you an Elvis...

17:01.156 --> 17:05.010
jam, peanut butter, whole pack of bacon.

17:10.017 --> 17:12.439
Sit, man. Eat.

17:13.503 --> 17:15.069
We eat this,

17:15.617 --> 17:16.858
and then you go.

17:17.457 --> 17:18.858
Where am I gonna go?

17:19.039 --> 17:21.031
Cops all over the place.

17:27.896 --> 17:30.016
Can we do this now?
I've got the day from hell.

17:30.017 --> 17:31.017
I'm just about to eat.

17:31.018 --> 17:32.628
It won't take a minute.

17:33.025 --> 17:35.136
- The house is a tip.
- Show home compared to mine.

17:44.617 --> 17:46.402
You hungry?

17:46.857 --> 17:48.216
Ah, yeah.

17:48.355 --> 17:50.496
I had a mate coming 'round,
but he blew me out.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.167
Okay. Usual questions.

17:54.487 --> 17:56.862
Have you made contact
with any known criminals,

17:56.877 --> 17:58.237
or have they made contact with

17:58.337 --> 17:59.776
or attempted to make contact with you?

17:59.857 --> 18:01.338
No.

18:02.737 --> 18:04.742
Do you want to talk
about what happened last night?

18:06.177 --> 18:08.616
Seeing Jonjo
must have brought things up.

18:08.695 --> 18:11.132
Do you want...
Do you want to talk about that?

18:14.057 --> 18:16.049
Do you know what? I can't do this.

18:20.377 --> 18:21.948
I want somebody else.

18:22.337 --> 18:24.096
I don't want anybody kind.

18:24.174 --> 18:25.582
I-I don't want anyone pretty.

18:25.645 --> 18:27.090
And I don't need you sitting there

18:27.145 --> 18:29.199
telling me about a life
that I'll never have.

18:30.617 --> 18:31.957
Okay.

18:33.074 --> 18:35.657
I'll talk to probation.
I'm sorry you feel like that.

18:39.906 --> 18:43.047
You know, the past
doesn't have to rule your life.

19:12.407 --> 19:13.751
A cop?

19:14.017 --> 19:15.759
Are you fucking serious?

19:15.937 --> 19:17.657
Not that I blame you. She's...

19:17.817 --> 19:19.112
She's fit.

19:19.172 --> 19:21.415
I'm putting you on my boat
until tonight.

19:21.817 --> 19:24.013
- And then you're gone.
- Or what?

19:24.257 --> 19:25.528
What are you gonna do?

19:25.786 --> 19:27.937
Tell your Little Miss Piglet?

19:29.857 --> 19:32.799
No one would ever miss you!

19:33.072 --> 19:34.971
Ah. Well, there he is.

19:35.201 --> 19:36.721
There's the Doll I know.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.182
I knew he was in there somewhere.

19:43.337 --> 19:44.950
That copper's wrong.

19:45.270 --> 19:47.096
You are who you are.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.283
I'm going out.

20:00.457 --> 20:03.074
- Couple hours.
- You've got customers?

20:03.177 --> 20:05.056
Right, you lock the door and stay put.

20:05.081 --> 20:06.828
- Sure.
- You've got to promise me, Evie.

20:06.853 --> 20:07.855
Okay, I promise.

20:11.790 --> 20:13.025
_

20:13.049 --> 20:15.416
__

21:10.103 --> 21:11.385
You all right?

21:12.471 --> 21:13.750
I'm a friend of the owner.

21:13.885 --> 21:15.725
Me too. Alan Redford.

21:16.544 --> 21:18.654
- Oliver Tench.
- Alan.

21:19.895 --> 21:22.896
Sorry. I should have said.
I gave him the keys.

21:23.146 --> 21:24.776
- He's an old mate.
- Look, mate.

21:25.239 --> 21:27.752
I only ever do this when I need a favor.

21:27.857 --> 21:29.016
What do you want?

21:29.135 --> 21:30.705
I need a bit of advice.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.166
Wee fiberglass issue.

21:34.377 --> 21:37.463
What do you think... replace or repair?

21:38.622 --> 21:40.497
To be honest with you,
mate, I'm not too sure.

21:40.537 --> 21:41.966
It'd be cheaper to repair it,

21:42.017 --> 21:44.684
but if you want a proper job,
replace it.

21:47.692 --> 21:49.992
We've watched some
of your counseling sessions

21:50.089 --> 21:51.416
with Jonjo Patterson.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.409
You told him his mental-health issues

21:53.456 --> 21:55.736
were due to the repression
of his desires.

21:55.932 --> 21:58.878
You advised him
to express his shadow side.

22:00.822 --> 22:03.291
I film those sessions
in order to be accountable.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.432
<i>I go out of my way
to try to help people.</i>

22:07.682 --> 22:09.829
You go out of your way
to try and <i>control</i> people.

22:10.134 --> 22:11.816
He burrows into people's minds.

22:11.817 --> 22:13.176
Only if we let him.

22:13.524 --> 22:16.577
<i>Was Niall Swift part of
your guided meditation group?</i>

22:17.862 --> 22:20.307
He might have attended
a couple of sessions.

22:20.497 --> 22:23.296
Did you not think to mention
that in your initial statement?

22:23.409 --> 22:25.415
I was in shock.

22:26.059 --> 22:27.498
I'd just found a dead body.

22:27.534 --> 22:28.952
There was a bunch of things
I didn't mention.

22:28.977 --> 22:30.657
Like what?

22:31.378 --> 22:34.011
Um, the people I met
on the jogging path.

22:34.217 --> 22:35.416
Who?

22:35.542 --> 22:38.576
Uh, the woman I borrowed the phone from.

22:38.685 --> 22:40.099
We've talked to her.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.162
Okay.

22:42.417 --> 22:45.336
Uh, the guy who runs
one of the tour boats.

22:45.337 --> 22:48.637
- What guy?
- Leighton someone.

22:48.873 --> 22:50.567
Leighton Thomas was working.

22:51.247 --> 22:53.177
Well, he couldn't have been.
I saw him up there.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.839
I told you to stay in the boat.

22:59.969 --> 23:01.977
You've finished
with Captain Haddock, then?

23:03.454 --> 23:05.071
What were you doing talking to him?

23:05.260 --> 23:06.751
You know, he's married to a copper.

23:08.575 --> 23:09.895
And he's a pal of yours?

23:10.817 --> 23:12.948
I reckon he'd be a good place to start.

23:13.112 --> 23:14.503
Start what?

23:14.675 --> 23:16.112
Let's do him.

23:16.573 --> 23:18.592
I'm serious.

23:18.622 --> 23:20.107
Why do you think I'm here?

23:20.154 --> 23:22.506
I hear the words "serial killer."
I look up. There you are.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.925
I'm thinking,
"Shit, he's started without me."

23:24.980 --> 23:26.177
"Let's do him"?

23:27.112 --> 23:29.011
What are you talking about?

23:35.137 --> 23:36.457
What's that?

23:38.097 --> 23:39.257
That's nearly 3 grand.

23:40.177 --> 23:41.376
What for?

23:41.968 --> 23:43.764
I fucked up your life.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.217
- I want you to take it.
- You didn't fuck up anything.

23:47.420 --> 23:49.016
We were a team!

23:49.123 --> 23:51.256
That's what the judge said.
That's what everyone said.

23:51.310 --> 23:53.724
- Remember that first one we did?
<i>- I</i> did!

23:54.052 --> 23:55.521
It was me.

23:55.833 --> 23:59.099
- You just stood there.
- Nah. I'm not having that.

23:59.302 --> 24:00.616
I kept the edge.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.136
You couldn't have done it without me.

24:02.166 --> 24:05.073
Mate, I was messed up, and I used you.

24:05.337 --> 24:08.157
You? You haven't got it in you.

24:08.602 --> 24:10.485
You want me to prove myself, yeah?

24:10.899 --> 24:12.416
Show you what I picked up in prison?

24:12.417 --> 24:15.196
I want you to take the money and go!

24:16.297 --> 24:17.802
You want me to go?

24:18.097 --> 24:21.677
Yeah, I don't know how fucking
clearer I have to make it!

24:23.737 --> 24:27.937
Look, Tench, man, get your head up.
There's a life out there!

24:28.817 --> 24:30.457
Not for me, there's not.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.278
If I walk away,

24:33.637 --> 24:35.277
I just vanish.

25:27.837 --> 25:29.077
Come on.

25:30.558 --> 25:32.381
How many girlfriends have you had?

25:32.662 --> 25:35.217
- Honestly?
- No, I'd rather you lied to me.

25:35.279 --> 25:36.932
None.

25:36.998 --> 25:38.463
Not one?

25:39.998 --> 25:41.487
What, seriously?

25:42.838 --> 25:44.635
When's your dad getting back?

25:45.798 --> 25:46.866
Oh, shit.

25:47.078 --> 25:48.878
- See you later.
- See you.

25:56.718 --> 25:59.398
- Where'd you come from?
- Evie all right?

26:01.084 --> 26:03.248
Did the cops ask you about Mr. Petrie?

26:03.459 --> 26:05.162
A bit. Why?

26:06.118 --> 26:08.838
I don't know. Just wondered.

26:10.758 --> 26:12.420
How much do you get for those?

26:12.561 --> 26:14.787
3 quid. Assassin for hire.

26:14.897 --> 26:17.545
Don McGrellish has promised me
a score if I get the wolf.

26:17.857 --> 26:19.568
Lent me this bad boy.

26:19.818 --> 26:21.161
Why would you want to kill a wolf?

26:21.763 --> 26:23.533
It's been picking off Don's sheep.

26:23.865 --> 26:25.630
You need to be careful up there.

26:26.358 --> 26:27.957
You want one for Evie?

26:28.013 --> 26:30.152
Evie would boke.

26:40.527 --> 26:42.021
Evie?

26:42.576 --> 26:45.029
Evie, we...
we need to talk this through.

26:45.091 --> 26:47.935
- Leave me alone.
- I know you broke into my house.

26:48.118 --> 26:49.038
Evie!

27:09.958 --> 27:12.357
Get the alibi
for Leighton Thomas verified.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.363
- Absolute priority.
- Yeah.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.783
He's enjoying this.

27:23.942 --> 27:26.221
You wanted in. You're in.

27:28.118 --> 27:29.797
Got Niall Swift's phone records.

27:29.861 --> 27:31.119
Oh.

27:33.774 --> 27:35.969
Looks like he had Petrie on speed dial.

27:36.638 --> 27:39.637
Mr. Petrie, I'm a criminal
psychologist helping with...

27:39.638 --> 27:41.134
I know who you are.

27:42.118 --> 27:44.254
Let's talk about Niall Swift.

27:44.598 --> 27:48.152
We have evidence that puts you
at the murder site.

27:48.199 --> 27:49.477
It's not my handwriting.

27:49.746 --> 27:52.597
The killer copies your handwriting,
then removes the pages?

27:52.644 --> 27:55.124
Allowing you to think
how clever you were to find it.

27:56.918 --> 27:59.597
For the tape, I am showing the suspect

27:59.835 --> 28:02.812
the phone records of Niall Swift

28:02.878 --> 28:05.307
for the days before he was murdered.

28:06.678 --> 28:08.323
I need a toilet break.

28:08.678 --> 28:10.424
- Can you explain...
- I know my rights.

28:10.467 --> 28:11.827
And I need a break.

28:29.229 --> 28:30.698
How you doing?

28:32.478 --> 28:33.958
Oliver, is it?

28:35.334 --> 28:38.196
You're married to that copper
who was around Dolly's.

28:38.807 --> 28:40.127
Who's Dolly?

28:46.649 --> 28:50.441
Just leave him the fuck alone.

29:23.558 --> 29:25.877
Crawford. Is your dad around?

29:25.958 --> 29:27.416
No, he's at home.

29:27.494 --> 29:30.712
I need to see last Tuesday's
bookings for Leighton Thomas.

29:30.798 --> 29:31.997
Have you got a warrant?

29:32.204 --> 29:35.016
- No, I don't have a...
- I'm just joking.

29:37.158 --> 29:39.032
Fill your boots.

29:47.970 --> 29:50.235
9:00 a.m, 10:00 a.m.

29:53.035 --> 29:56.660
Could your dad have forgotten to
write some of the bookings down?

29:56.832 --> 29:59.078
He's got lung cancer, not brain cancer.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.238
These are the stubs?

30:01.998 --> 30:03.599
These are last year's tickets.

30:05.118 --> 30:07.099
The new ones are a different color.

30:36.345 --> 30:39.291
_

30:42.564 --> 30:44.032
Dolly.

30:44.998 --> 30:48.677
Two weeks ago,
Niall Swift wrote in his diary,

30:48.837 --> 30:51.017
"I'm always there for everyone.

30:51.087 --> 30:53.678
Why is no one ever there for me?"

30:54.564 --> 30:56.551
Did you sense that Swift was needy

30:56.598 --> 30:59.078
when he attended your meditation group?

31:00.078 --> 31:01.356
No.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.053
How do you account for the fact

31:03.106 --> 31:07.421
that he made 17 calls to you in a week?

31:08.398 --> 31:10.710
We were discussing students.

31:10.798 --> 31:12.296
17 calls?

31:12.444 --> 31:14.085
Well, we had a lot to talk about.

31:14.158 --> 31:16.054
Was he putting pressure on you?

31:16.158 --> 31:18.317
- No.
- Threatened to tell your wife?

31:18.414 --> 31:19.917
Tell her what?

31:20.109 --> 31:21.969
That the two of you
were having an affair.

31:22.038 --> 31:23.453
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

31:23.518 --> 31:25.117
So why didn't you mention the calls?

31:25.164 --> 31:26.508
Well, I didn't think they were relevant.

31:26.555 --> 31:27.744
That was your secret, wasn't it?

31:27.783 --> 31:28.957
- No, it wasn't a secret.
- Like the secrets

31:28.958 --> 31:32.252
you take from your students,
secrets you keep from your wife?

31:32.448 --> 31:34.465
That's why you took Niall Swift's phone.

31:34.621 --> 31:36.926
- I didn't take his phone.
- It vanished?

31:37.558 --> 31:38.653
Well, I-I wouldn't know.

31:38.678 --> 31:40.512
You take a massive risk with this man.

31:41.136 --> 31:42.683
Now you're in danger
of losing everything.

31:42.730 --> 31:43.792
Oh, Christ.

31:43.831 --> 31:46.573
Your wife, your kids, your job...

31:46.718 --> 31:48.581
everyone's respect.

31:49.278 --> 31:51.597
17 calls in a week,

31:51.704 --> 31:53.765
two in the three months before that.

31:53.915 --> 31:55.798
What could have been so urgent?

31:56.626 --> 31:59.117
He was worried
about one of his students.

31:59.196 --> 32:01.277
- Which one?
- He didn't say which one.

32:01.278 --> 32:02.877
- He <i>was</i> threatening you.
- No.

32:02.878 --> 32:04.583
But he had no idea
what he'd tapped into.

32:04.802 --> 32:06.919
You really didn't have a choice,
did you?

32:09.755 --> 32:11.357
You know, in your books,

32:11.435 --> 32:13.277
you always take more credit
than you're due.

32:13.302 --> 32:15.593
- Niall Swift didn't have a clue, did he?
- Let's just stick to this.

32:15.632 --> 32:17.157
But no matter how many you help solve,

32:17.158 --> 32:19.717
you can't solve the one
that matters, can you?

32:19.788 --> 32:21.477
- Mr. Petrie...
- About this time of year.

32:21.478 --> 32:23.779
Maybe if you'd walked her home
from school like you were told,

32:23.804 --> 32:26.366
then your little sister
would still be alive.

32:32.805 --> 32:33.885
Excuse me?

32:34.558 --> 32:36.530
You still think it was the teacher?

32:36.718 --> 32:37.917
Is he still alive?

32:37.963 --> 32:39.276
Interview suspended.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.358
Walking about?

32:40.393 --> 32:43.333
Hot day like today. Eating ice cream.

32:43.358 --> 32:44.799
Maybe if they'd found the body...

32:44.885 --> 32:46.937
Blake. Blake!

32:47.438 --> 32:50.008
- Hey, Albrighton! No, no!
- Blake.

32:52.397 --> 32:53.941
Get out, Blake.

32:54.070 --> 32:55.713
Go back to the hotel.

33:21.678 --> 33:23.243
Annie?

33:23.767 --> 33:25.454
Why did you lie to me about Leighton?

33:25.876 --> 33:27.757
- What?
- You invited him into our home,

33:27.758 --> 33:29.237
and you introduced him to our daughter.

33:29.238 --> 33:30.557
He's a murderer, Annie.

33:31.006 --> 33:33.357
- How do you know this?
- I met his old partner.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.117
- What partner?
- Oliver Tench!

33:35.118 --> 33:36.608
He's down by the jetty.

33:36.764 --> 33:37.933
Where's Evie? Is she okay?

33:37.958 --> 33:39.196
Yeah, she's fine. Did you call her?

33:39.867 --> 33:41.700
- I need to go.
- Are you even part

33:41.750 --> 33:43.243
of this family anymore?

33:43.539 --> 33:44.695
Annie!

33:49.718 --> 33:52.739
Leighton Thomas gave Jason
last year's ticket stubs.

33:52.878 --> 33:55.075
- His alibi's bullshit.
- What?

33:56.004 --> 33:59.648
I thought I'd hit rock bottom.
You've just found a whole new level.

34:00.195 --> 34:02.074
Can I have
everybody's attention, please?

34:02.107 --> 34:03.343
There's something else.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.797
The guy Leighton was convicted with...

34:07.054 --> 34:08.389
Oliver Tench?

34:09.150 --> 34:10.376
He's here.

34:10.704 --> 34:12.346
He's in Lochnafoy.

34:21.891 --> 34:23.476
Hello?

34:23.554 --> 34:26.469
<i>I made a mistake, but I'm gonna sort it.</i>

34:26.594 --> 34:28.989
When? What... What mistake?

34:29.364 --> 34:32.349
Don't worry.
I'm gonna tie it off right now.

34:32.552 --> 34:34.469
What mistake, Tench?

34:35.302 --> 34:38.020
I let slip my name to your mate Alan.

34:40.830 --> 34:42.255
Where are you?

34:42.389 --> 34:44.520
<i>I'm not letting them put you away again.</i>

34:44.614 --> 34:46.590
Hang on. Tench.

34:47.395 --> 34:48.750
Shit.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.685
Don't let the bastard get to you, Blake!

35:06.781 --> 35:08.429
Why did you let him in?!

35:08.790 --> 35:10.367
Shit!

35:26.382 --> 35:28.921
<i>If I complain,
they'll just increase the dose.</i>

35:34.190 --> 35:36.188
<i>Do you regret that you
didn't do more to help?</i>

35:36.625 --> 35:37.883
<i>Kind of, yeah.</i>

35:40.990 --> 35:44.069
<i>It's no secret that
Baxter's behavior towards you</i>

35:44.070 --> 35:46.972
<i>has been concerning to staff.</i>

35:48.110 --> 35:49.445
<i>He thinks it's funny.</i>

35:49.470 --> 35:51.149
<i>Well, imagine
for a moment that it was you,</i>

35:51.215 --> 35:53.113
<i>that you were able to fight back.</i>

35:54.110 --> 35:57.070
<i>Could you describe
what you'd like to do to him?</i>

36:18.497 --> 36:22.450
Okay, we need to locate and arrest

36:22.612 --> 36:24.651
Leighton Thomas and Oliver Tench.

36:24.765 --> 36:27.297
Can you circulate
a description of Tench?

36:27.359 --> 36:30.710
I want every available
uniformed officer.

36:30.820 --> 36:33.796
No one approaches these men
without backup.

36:34.499 --> 36:36.343
Where the hell is D.S. Redford?

36:44.132 --> 36:45.449
Leighton!

36:49.092 --> 36:50.772
Tench!

37:01.377 --> 37:03.369
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

37:03.409 --> 37:05.252
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

37:07.262 --> 37:08.683
What?

37:09.034 --> 37:11.308
- Did you kill Jonjo?
- What?

37:11.620 --> 37:13.066
Did you kill Niall Swift?

37:13.234 --> 37:15.953
I didn't kill anybody.
Annie, you know that.

37:16.196 --> 37:19.274
You lied about your alibi!

37:20.634 --> 37:23.393
I-I didn't want people
to know what I am.

37:23.394 --> 37:25.809
- Where's Tench?
- I don't know.

37:25.834 --> 37:27.495
- Don't lie to me!
- Look...

37:27.581 --> 37:30.873
Annie, all I know
is that he's looking for Alan.

37:30.909 --> 37:32.833
- Why?
- Tench is trying to protect me.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.834
- Alan knows who we are.
- Shit.

37:37.525 --> 37:40.697
Come on. Alan.

37:41.954 --> 37:44.368
Shit.

37:44.754 --> 37:47.793
Probably on his...
on his bloody mountain.

38:12.954 --> 38:14.437
Don't tell me.

38:14.563 --> 38:15.963
You'll be home late.

38:22.554 --> 38:25.314
Alan, you've got to call me back.
Please call me back.

38:41.438 --> 38:43.078
What the...

39:07.776 --> 39:10.190
Let me come with you. I can talk to him.

39:10.253 --> 39:12.609
You should have talked to <i>me</i>
as soon as he showed up!

39:12.634 --> 39:14.034
I wanted to help him!

39:24.834 --> 39:25.909
Stop!

39:26.448 --> 39:27.807
Are you trying to kill yourself?

39:27.925 --> 39:29.915
I know what Tench needs to hear.

39:30.549 --> 39:32.325
- No.
- Come on.

39:32.489 --> 39:34.833
Look, I can get his attention.

39:34.942 --> 39:37.184
You go across the burn
and come up behind him.

39:37.314 --> 39:38.723
Annie!

39:39.070 --> 39:41.922
- You've got to trust me.
- Okay.

39:55.701 --> 39:57.241
Fuck!

40:08.980 --> 40:10.411
You've been sticking your nose in.

40:11.050 --> 40:12.329
Into what?

40:12.669 --> 40:14.073
Things I might have done.

40:14.192 --> 40:15.553
You tell your wife?

40:15.554 --> 40:17.076
- No.
- You're lying!

40:17.668 --> 40:19.358
Tench!

40:23.217 --> 40:25.326
Get the fuck away.

40:25.365 --> 40:27.207
- I'm doing this.
- Nah.

40:27.762 --> 40:30.514
Come on. Give me the knife.

40:32.929 --> 40:33.929
Fuck it.

40:53.834 --> 40:56.105
Oi, oi! Oi! Oi!

40:56.355 --> 40:57.913
What you trying to save him for?

40:57.958 --> 40:59.633
He's not the one I'm trying to save.

40:59.634 --> 41:00.809
Oliver!

41:01.511 --> 41:03.111
What the fuck?!

41:04.519 --> 41:05.599
Drop the knife.

41:06.314 --> 41:07.553
You turned me over.

41:07.673 --> 41:09.243
Yeah!

41:09.634 --> 41:10.913
So go on!

41:11.994 --> 41:13.579
Just do it.

41:15.514 --> 41:17.502
You let me down.

41:18.698 --> 41:20.346
Yeah, I know.

41:20.514 --> 41:22.471
And I'm sorry.

41:23.034 --> 41:25.409
I dragged you over the edge.

41:26.607 --> 41:29.084
We were just a couple of fucked-up kids.

41:31.061 --> 41:33.193
I thought we were flying.

41:33.650 --> 41:35.285
No, mate.

41:35.918 --> 41:37.582
We were <i>falling.</i>

42:39.394 --> 42:40.716
Leighton.

42:42.914 --> 42:44.372
You saved a life.

42:44.674 --> 42:46.442
That counts for something.

42:59.074 --> 43:00.260
Alan.

43:00.394 --> 43:03.760
Annie, there's something
I need to tell you.

43:04.074 --> 43:06.369
- What?
- I'm sorry.

43:06.478 --> 43:08.213
Excuse me. We have
to get him to the hospital.

43:08.274 --> 43:09.154
I'm sorry.

43:10.834 --> 43:12.754
- I'm sorry.
- Tell me later.

43:16.634 --> 43:18.477
Annie.

43:18.907 --> 43:20.876
I lied.

43:36.198 --> 43:39.237
_

43:55.323 --> 43:58.487
Right, so, the hair
from the roof fabric in the van

43:58.588 --> 44:00.346
doesn't match Petrie.

44:00.474 --> 44:02.872
- What a surprise.
- Mm.

44:05.099 --> 44:06.325
Got another blue van.

44:12.429 --> 44:14.840
I've got a match on the license plate.

44:15.074 --> 44:16.434
Hmm?

44:21.234 --> 44:24.260
Oh, we've got the van!
The one Jonjo was found in.

44:30.231 --> 44:31.350
Now, I bet it's his.

44:31.588 --> 44:33.412
You know... the hair.

44:34.927 --> 44:36.909
Get the closest shot of his face.

44:36.990 --> 44:39.388
Get it enhanced, get it circulated...

44:39.451 --> 44:41.629
Manchester police a priority.

44:41.693 --> 44:44.289
Speak to the cashier.
Show him the image.

44:44.394 --> 44:48.035
Anything distinctive he
remembers... tats, piercings.

44:48.129 --> 44:49.753
Did he pay by credit card?

44:49.842 --> 44:53.412
Finding this man
is now number one priority.

45:14.924 --> 45:17.750
We have a male in possession of a firearm

45:17.782 --> 45:20.601
and reason to believe he is connected
to the murders.

45:20.626 --> 45:22.003
Why won't he stop?

45:22.004 --> 45:23.370
People are afraid to leave their houses

45:23.395 --> 45:25.237
and you're letting some idiot
run around with a rifle?

45:25.262 --> 45:29.089
- Monster! Monster!
- Puts him next to the heart on the beach.

45:29.182 --> 45:31.163
- Shut up!
- Bethan, what have you done to her?

45:31.164 --> 45:33.530
You need to make it clear
that I am not a suspect.

45:36.244 --> 45:38.443
You wanna know what happened to
Bethan? Do you?

45:38.444 --> 45:41.123
Get rid of her. I will not be
responsible for my actions.

45:41.124 --> 45:42.763
You realize how serious this is?

45:42.788 --> 45:44.899
Are we looking at the killer?

45:44.924 --> 45:47.025
Can you request an armed response unit?

45:47.060 --> 45:49.697
- DCI Quigley?
- We need to stick together.
