02:53.548 --> 02:58.386
MASK GIRL

02:59.679 --> 03:03.474
MO-MI KIM

03:05.935 --> 03:07.395
Next person, come in.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.608
Open your mouth.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.156
Next person. Come in.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.551
Open your mouth.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.514
Tilt your head up.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.018
Lift your tongue.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.776
Turn around, spread your legs,
and bend down.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.449
Bend down.

04:10.625 --> 04:16.381
PEACE AND HARMONY

04:24.305 --> 04:26.516
Mm-hm. She won't make it
through the night.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.085
Whoa!

04:54.836 --> 04:56.379
Jesus fucking Christ.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.923
You were on TV, weren't you?
You're Mask Girl!

04:59.966 --> 05:01.467
You look way better in person.

05:03.594 --> 05:06.806
I swear the plastic surgery
isn't super noticeable.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.267
Everyone said you were
a plastic surgery addict,

05:09.350 --> 05:11.019
but you don't look it at all.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.895
And so, how much did it cost?

05:15.064 --> 05:15.898
Hmm?

05:17.567 --> 05:18.651
Thirty million won.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.445
Thirty million?!

05:20.528 --> 05:22.280
It cost her 30 million won!

05:26.951 --> 05:28.786
Eyes and nose are a given.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.621
Cheekbones?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.206
Forehead.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.792
Did you get your jaw contoured?

05:36.627 --> 05:39.005
Wow. Anywhere else?
Did you get a boob job too?

05:40.798 --> 05:42.467
These are just
my original breasts.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.677
Except for her boobs,
she got everything done!

05:45.928 --> 05:48.681
Except for her boobs.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.559
Honestly, though.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.354
I wanna try plastic surgery
to see if I can become prettier.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.857
She had work done?
Wow! Looks so natural. Hmm.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.693
You should get a neck lift
for your sagging skin, old-timer.

06:00.777 --> 06:04.155
And if you get your under-eye fat removed,
you'll look much younger.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.910
A minor nose job
might also be useful, I think.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.870
You're basically saying
get a new face.

06:12.914 --> 06:17.210
What a true professional! If you know
a doctor that does a good job, hook me up.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.504
So when I get out,
I can get everything done.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.923
Get everything done and what?
Milk another man dry?

06:22.006 --> 06:25.093
You're trying to
sink your teeth into a rich man's neck

06:25.176 --> 06:26.677
and live the easy life, right?

06:26.761 --> 06:27.595
Ha!

06:27.678 --> 06:31.057
-You bitches are a shitshow.
-You're all insane.

06:31.140 --> 06:34.018
Think I wanna get a nose job.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.521
Oh my. It's cold.
Let's go. C'mon.

06:36.604 --> 06:37.939
Let's go, c'mon.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.775
Move!

06:44.028 --> 06:45.905
Girl, don't stare, don't stare.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.328
Who the hell is that woman?

06:53.204 --> 06:54.956
That's An Eun-suk.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.250
"An Eun-suk"?

06:59.001 --> 07:01.170
That woman's the queen here.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.256
She even has authority over the warden.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.677
She's connected to politicians,
conglomerate owners, you name it.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.680
You may get released and land a top
position if you manage to win her favor.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.641
-That much, huh?
-Yeah. Look away. Don't be stupid.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.187
She gets skincare here
whenever she feels like it

07:18.271 --> 07:21.149
and even calls in shamans to do rituals.
Oof, it's cold.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.026
And how did that woman end up here anyway?

07:27.530 --> 07:29.240
For aiding and abetting murder.

07:29.323 --> 07:32.785
She hired someone to chop up
her husband and his mistress into pieces.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.996
Isn't it insane?

07:35.079 --> 07:37.123
Oh right. You did it too.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.294
Hey, Eun-suk is calling you.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.525
Have your legs

08:05.401 --> 08:06.444
been injured?

08:07.236 --> 08:08.154
What?

08:08.237 --> 08:09.780
You dragged your feet.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.250
So you're Mask Girl, correct?

08:22.084 --> 08:22.919
Yes.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.138
You look way too similar.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.809
You look way too similar
to the bitch who seduced my husband, so…

08:40.645 --> 08:43.689
stay the hell out of my sight
if you understand what I mean.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.317
Or else I'll kill you myself.

09:13.761 --> 09:14.595
Please.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.942
Why isn't she feeding her?

09:29.151 --> 09:30.653
She's in here for adultery.

09:31.862 --> 09:36.450
Eun-suk made a rule that adulteresses
must starve for three days.

09:50.047 --> 09:53.259
-Hey. What are you doing?
-She must be hungry.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.305
You're putting
yourself in danger.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.770
It's okay.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.859
It's not okay!

10:10.943 --> 10:12.111
Enjoy your lunch.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.691
♪ My face is like an apple ♪

10:50.775 --> 10:52.943
♪ So shiny and so pretty ♪

10:53.527 --> 10:56.197
♪ Got my eyes done, got my nose done ♪

10:57.114 --> 11:02.161
♪ Got my entire face done! ♪

11:09.293 --> 11:10.211
Fuckin--

11:10.878 --> 11:12.088
What are you looking at?

11:13.381 --> 11:14.382
Hey.

11:15.883 --> 11:16.967
Hey, you!

11:18.219 --> 11:20.805
Oh, this… this fucking bitch.

11:20.888 --> 11:24.141
Do you want me to put you in the washer
and clean you too?

11:31.190 --> 11:33.734
Don't act out,
and mind your own business

11:34.235 --> 11:35.528
if you don't wanna die.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.075
What?

11:42.076 --> 11:45.037
Want me to make your face
all crooked again? Huh?

11:52.670 --> 11:53.504
What's wrong?

11:54.964 --> 11:56.132
What ya staring at?

11:56.674 --> 11:57.717
An ugly woman.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.970
Fucking bitch.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.180
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey!

12:03.264 --> 12:06.100
-Do something!
-Let go, bitch! Stop!

12:06.183 --> 12:07.685
Let go! Let go!

12:07.768 --> 12:09.645
-Hey!
-Let go of me!

12:09.729 --> 12:11.355
-She's crazy!
-Fuck!

12:12.606 --> 12:13.899
-Shit!
-Tramp!

12:13.983 --> 12:16.318
Hey!

12:16.402 --> 12:18.529
-Let go!
-Hey!

12:18.612 --> 12:21.741
Let go!
Get off of me! Let go! Let go!

12:21.824 --> 12:22.658
Stop!

12:48.225 --> 12:51.645
-Why am I the only one being locked up?
-Because you hit her first.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.857
They picked a fight with me first.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.276
Listen,

12:58.110 --> 12:59.945
you can't mess with Eun-suk's gang.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.665
Number 1047.
Your punishment is over.

13:26.055 --> 13:26.931
Mask Girl.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.684
I told you you were putting yourself
in danger. Don't stir shit.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.063
The best thing to do in this hellhole
is stay quiet as a mouse,

13:34.647 --> 13:37.900
then get parole for good behavior
and get out while you're young.

13:39.151 --> 13:42.071
A nail that sticks out
is bound to get hammered in.

13:44.406 --> 13:45.991
Anyway…

13:54.458 --> 13:56.627
Leave her alone, you crazy slut!

13:57.294 --> 13:59.755
Stop it, you bitch!
Are you crazy?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.424
-Grab her! Grab her!
-You bitch!

14:04.426 --> 14:07.096
Crazy bitch, stop it!
Leave her the fuck alone!

14:07.179 --> 14:08.055
Stop it, bitch!

14:10.140 --> 14:12.643
I'm gonna kill you,
you fuckin' slut!

14:15.938 --> 14:20.109
Number 1047,
you are sentenced to 15 days in solitary.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.162
Get me help!

14:35.207 --> 14:36.709
Leave her alone!

15:14.914 --> 15:16.957
Bitch! Leave her alone!

15:17.833 --> 15:20.753
You fucker! Guys, come help us!

15:22.171 --> 15:24.256
Help me! Please help-- Help me!

15:24.340 --> 15:26.467
Pull her hair! Somebody stop her!

15:26.550 --> 15:29.637
-Help me!
-Get off of her! You're crazy!

15:30.638 --> 15:32.056
EDIFICATION ACCORDING TO LAW AND PRINCIPLE
HUISEONG PENITENTIARY

15:32.139 --> 15:35.476
I'm so exhausted.
All thanks to that Mo-mi Kim.

15:36.977 --> 15:40.481
Can't you have her
locked up in solitary confinement forever?

15:40.564 --> 15:44.401
We already locked her up
far longer than what the rules stipulate.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.071
They're going to run an inspection soon.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.865
I hope things don't get too wild.

15:50.866 --> 15:54.453
If the inspector catches wind of this,
you could also get roped into it.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.375
Well, anyway,
isn't my face too wrinkly now? Mmm?

15:59.458 --> 16:00.584
Let me have a look.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.462
Closer.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
Oh, you're right.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.592
You do need a couple filler injections.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.135
Filler?

16:10.219 --> 16:12.763
One shot and your skin
will be smooth like that.

16:12.846 --> 16:13.889
I can hook you up.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.933
That'd be perfect. Thanks!

16:19.103 --> 16:21.689
Number 1047,
your punishment is over.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.452
-I'm full.
-Me too. I ate too much.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.079
That's exactly what I'm saying.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.123
I need to go on a diet,
I'm really struggling.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.084
-Are you serious?
-Bullshit. You look fantastic.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.128
Fuck. That psycho bitch is here again.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.965
-Why is that bitch already out?
-Yeah, why? Shit.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.763
-Hmm.
-Where are you going? Hey!

16:58.475 --> 16:59.393
Damn it.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.778
Hey! What are you doing?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.656
Oh my God!

17:15.034 --> 17:16.493
I can't run any faster!

17:17.745 --> 17:21.290
-Oh! I'm sorry!
-Help me. Help me! Help me!

17:22.374 --> 17:24.001
Okay, okay. W-- Wait a second.

17:24.084 --> 17:27.254
I'm sorry, don't hit me!
Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.006
Stop it!

17:36.305 --> 17:38.182
How about we leave each other alone.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.850
Truce, no fighting.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.227
Okay?

17:42.811 --> 17:45.564
Say it's okay! Yes?

17:57.284 --> 18:00.287
-Oh my God!
-Let me help you! Are you okay?

18:00.370 --> 18:02.706
Fine. Shit.
Did she hurt you?

18:09.338 --> 18:10.964
Bitch is crazier than I thought.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.913
Notifying all inmates.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.624
A meeting between the inmates
and the new warden

18:45.707 --> 18:47.459
will be held at the auditorium.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.879
All inmates, please come
to the auditorium.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.344
Face left.

19:00.013 --> 19:00.889
Move forward.

19:11.733 --> 19:12.651
I don't care…

19:12.734 --> 19:13.777
A FRESH START WITH LOVE

19:13.861 --> 19:16.572
…about the crimes you have committed.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.657
It's simple.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.410
In front of God, we are all sinners.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.454
My first duty is to help you

19:24.955 --> 19:27.416
in sincerely repenting
and beginning a new life.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.293
That's what I really want for you.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.919
My dear ladies,

19:31.628 --> 19:35.048
free yourself from your mind's prison
and look for salvation.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.050
Then, this place

19:37.676 --> 19:38.802
will feel like heaven.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.346
Do you understand?

19:43.098 --> 19:43.974
No!

19:44.474 --> 19:47.686
From now on,
we don't answer with a "yes, ma'am."

19:47.769 --> 19:51.940
We always say, um,
"I love you," you got it?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.028
Repeat after me.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.530
I love you!

19:58.614 --> 20:00.199
I love you.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.909
Very good. Louder!

20:03.118 --> 20:04.661
I love you.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.413
Very nice. Once more!

20:06.496 --> 20:07.956
-I love you.
-Very good.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.625
Look at the person next to you.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.336
Look them in the eyes and tell them.
What do you say?

20:12.419 --> 20:15.672
She's acting like a cult leader,
not a prison warden, don't you think?

20:15.756 --> 20:18.175
-Shout it together! Everyone!
-What is she doing?

20:18.258 --> 20:20.344
I love you! Everyone!

20:21.220 --> 20:22.262
I love you.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.388
I love you.

20:23.472 --> 20:27.434
-She's new. Just came in today.
-Ah, so, uh, you came in today?

20:27.976 --> 20:30.229
Number 2058. You're so young.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.939
Uh, how did you end up here?

20:33.315 --> 20:35.108
I severed the dick of an asshole.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.319
Ah…

20:43.700 --> 20:46.578
Do you know
that a person's body was created by God?

20:47.162 --> 20:52.000
And therefore, we should definitely not
intentionally destroy such creations.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.628
Can I go?

20:56.213 --> 20:57.172
Absolutely.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.007
I love you.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.012
-She's Mask Girl.
-Oh, Mask Girl, huh?

21:04.888 --> 21:06.265
I heard a lot about you.

21:06.348 --> 21:10.060
That you had been showing exemplary
conduct in the penitentiary.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.398
To me, you know,

21:15.190 --> 21:18.026
it doesn't matter what you did
when you were outside of those walls.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.821
In my prison, everyone is treated equally.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.531
Here, we are all God's children.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.533
You know that, right?

21:26.660 --> 21:28.662
Very good. I love you.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.999
A FRESH START WITH LOVE
HUISEONG PENITENTIARY

21:34.668 --> 21:37.170
I heard zen chai is your favorite,
so I made one.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.090
Oh my goodness. You're the best.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.468
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.308
I heard a lot about you
from the previous warden.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.851
So you'll take care of me?

21:51.435 --> 21:53.520
Oh no. Take good care of me.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.606
Cheers!

21:56.690 --> 21:58.692
Cheers.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.696
Gosh.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.740
The cherry blossoms are so pretty.

22:11.705 --> 22:12.581
Excuse me.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.334
Are you really Mask Girl?

22:17.461 --> 22:18.795
Yeah. That's her.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.049
Oh shit, that's fuckin' sick, man.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.885
I never thought I'd meet Mask Girl here.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.346
You know what?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.973
You've always been my hero.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.934
All of my friends
super look up to you, you know?

22:33.018 --> 22:33.935
Look up to her?

22:35.395 --> 22:38.565
All those scumbags
you chopped up into pieces.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.651
I chickened out
and only cut a guy's dick off.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.197
Wow, fuck.
I'm gonna fuckin' brag when I get out.

22:48.825 --> 22:52.162
That girl from earlier,
doesn't she seem a little cuckoo?

22:53.121 --> 22:58.043
These days, I feel like there are
more and more kids who are just nuts.

22:58.919 --> 22:59.753
Shit.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.383
-Number 1047, you've got a letter.
-A letter?

23:06.093 --> 23:07.010
Whoa!

23:07.761 --> 23:10.722
Isn't this the first letter you got
since you got here? Who's it from?

23:10.806 --> 23:13.183
It says "MG Love" on the envelope.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.060
"MG Love"? Wow.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.355
So it's not a legend. You really do
have fans outside, don't you?

23:18.438 --> 23:19.564
FROM MG LOVE
TO MO-MI KIM 1047

23:19.648 --> 23:22.943
So many years passed and
there's still someone thinking about you?

23:23.026 --> 23:24.486
My God!

23:31.952 --> 23:32.786
What is that?

23:33.453 --> 23:36.540
That's not a letter.
It looks like some kinda news article.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.629
"Is violence genetic"? What?

23:47.801 --> 23:49.094
SOCIAL EDUCATION NECESSARY

23:49.177 --> 23:50.971
TO SUPPRESS MANIFESTATION
OF GENETIC VIOLENCE

23:57.853 --> 23:59.312
Hey, what is this?

24:00.981 --> 24:04.734
"It's your turn to feel what it feels like
when your kid is broken, bitch"?

24:06.194 --> 24:08.405
Huh, who the hell
sent something like this?

24:24.379 --> 24:25.589
IS VIOLENCE GENETIC?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.883
You're reading
that article again?

24:28.758 --> 24:31.178
What does it change
if you keep looking at it?

24:31.261 --> 24:32.888
It only torments you.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.225
Anyway.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.855
How come you never mentioned
you had a kid all this time? I'm hurt.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.902
But how the hell
could they say that about a child?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.862
It isn't her fault.

24:48.945 --> 24:50.822
I can't believe it. God. Ugh.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.365
Cellie…

24:52.949 --> 24:53.867
Yeah?

24:56.077 --> 24:56.995
What?

25:00.457 --> 25:02.000
I need to get out.

25:02.751 --> 25:03.585
What?!

25:05.879 --> 25:06.796
You shittin' me?

25:07.422 --> 25:08.882
Oh my goodness, you mean it!

25:09.382 --> 25:10.217
Oh!

25:10.842 --> 25:12.219
Do what you want!

25:13.553 --> 25:16.264
Do you think getting out of here
is something you can just

25:16.348 --> 25:17.390
do when you feel like it?

25:18.308 --> 25:19.643
I didn't hear a thing.

25:19.726 --> 25:20.644
Not a word!

25:58.306 --> 26:00.642
Are you working on all of these at once?

26:03.770 --> 26:04.688
Yeah.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.107
It's easier for me to work that way.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.487
This really slows you down, though.
Do one at a time.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.324
Pick up your speed!

26:19.452 --> 26:22.414
APRIL 13
2:14 P.M.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.291
APRIL 13
2:50 P.M.

27:04.664 --> 27:05.498
What is it?

27:06.124 --> 27:07.417
I have to use the restroom.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.170
Go ahead. Be quick.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.182
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to the restroom.

27:23.266 --> 27:24.142
You may pass.

27:33.068 --> 27:33.902
Go on.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.815
What you're planting
right now are strawberries.

28:11.898 --> 28:15.527
Because strawberries prefer cool climates,
they do well in the winter.

28:15.610 --> 28:19.072
But in the central region of Korea,
if you don't cover them up well,

28:19.155 --> 28:22.367
their leaves or flowers in full bloom
could be damaged by frost.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.285
Yes. Uh, red lettuce there.

28:24.828 --> 28:25.787
Green lettuce here.

28:33.044 --> 28:36.339
-Ouch! Oh, something stung me!
-What's going on?

28:36.423 --> 28:38.883
A bug. It's a bug, a bug!
Ah, gosh, where'd it go?

28:38.967 --> 28:41.886
Goddammit! Ow! It's there--
It's there, uh!

28:42.887 --> 28:45.348
Uh-- We're running a bit low
on seedlings here.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.142
They're in storage. Go bring some.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.228
It's not here. It's gone.
Where did it sting you?

28:50.311 --> 28:53.690
-Is it gone? Oh, it hurt a lot.
-Are you okay?

28:53.773 --> 28:55.150
Ah, thought I would die.

29:52.373 --> 29:54.876
Hey, stop! Get down right now!

29:54.959 --> 29:57.212
Get down!

29:57.295 --> 29:59.297
Get down! Get down right now!

30:09.432 --> 30:10.266
I don't--

30:11.893 --> 30:14.020
I was so good to them, no?

30:14.604 --> 30:17.023
How could someone
try to break out of our prison?

30:18.399 --> 30:19.943
It doesn't make sense at all.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.950
What the hell did you do
in the control center?

30:27.742 --> 30:28.785
I'm sorry, ma'am.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.998
Lock Mask Girl up.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.125
In solitary. For at least… a month.

30:37.293 --> 30:41.005
Um, the maximum duration
for solitary is two weeks.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.135
Ah, true!

30:46.219 --> 30:49.430
Right, two weeks, two weeks. Two weeks!

30:50.473 --> 30:53.142
Make up reasons to hold her
for as long as I say.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.895
How about "causing a disturbance"
or "threatening officers"?

30:55.979 --> 30:57.438
Are these sufficient reasons?

30:58.565 --> 30:59.649
Do I…

31:00.358 --> 31:02.151
need to explain everything?

31:02.777 --> 31:05.113
No, ma'am. I apologize, ma'am.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.157
Get out.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.493
Get out!

31:27.010 --> 31:28.428
Number 1047.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.812
HOLY BIBLE

31:48.156 --> 31:49.157
What is this?

31:49.949 --> 31:52.035
It's the Holy Bible, obviously.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.205
Why did you give me this?

31:56.289 --> 31:59.834
According to the warden, you did what you
did 'cause you were tempted by the devil.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.039
-You're dismissed.
-Ma'am.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.709
I think you should see
prisoner number 1047

32:41.793 --> 32:43.586
in solitary confinement.

32:44.879 --> 32:45.755
Who's that?

32:45.838 --> 32:47.674
Um, Mask Girl.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.135
What about her?
Did she cause trouble again?

32:51.219 --> 32:52.595
No. But, uh…

32:58.685 --> 33:00.687
How long has she been in solitary again?

33:01.479 --> 33:04.732
-A little over a month.
-One month?

33:05.358 --> 33:07.068
-It's already been that long?
-Yep.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.488
She's here.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.217
What is she doing?

33:32.176 --> 33:33.052
She's praying.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.430
She does that all day.

33:39.851 --> 33:43.396
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

33:43.479 --> 33:47.275
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.403
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our tres--

33:52.822 --> 33:54.615
Oh my goodness!

33:55.116 --> 33:56.034
Are you okay?

33:56.951 --> 33:59.078
Your lips have split, sweetheart.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.830
Oh, those fuckin' assholes!

34:01.622 --> 34:05.043
I mean, how could they
lock you up in solitary for over a month?

34:05.126 --> 34:07.962
Isn't this illegal?
Should I just report them?

34:10.631 --> 34:12.800
It's okay, my friend.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.219
It was a meaningful time for me.

34:17.555 --> 34:18.806
You seem kinda different.

34:21.976 --> 34:22.810
Do I?

34:24.270 --> 34:26.522
Uh… Well, um, I…

34:27.899 --> 34:30.359
It's because I became a child of the Lord.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.237
What? What are you talking about?

34:34.864 --> 34:37.575
When I was in there,
the Lord spoke to me directly.

34:39.994 --> 34:41.496
…that he will save me.

34:43.956 --> 34:44.999
All of my life,

34:45.833 --> 34:48.961
I always believed
I'd never be saved no matter what.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.007
But the Lord appeared to me,

34:53.674 --> 34:57.136
despite my wrongdoings
and all the sins I've committed.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.348
After I began walking with the Lord…

35:02.308 --> 35:03.142
everything

35:04.227 --> 35:06.020
changed drastically for me.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.021
Amen!

35:08.564 --> 35:11.526
FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT
INMATE'S TESTIMONY OF FAITH

35:20.743 --> 35:21.661
Dude…

35:23.204 --> 35:25.331
You're pretending to believe
in Jesus, right?

35:25.414 --> 35:26.916
To get on the good side of the warden?

35:27.583 --> 35:29.961
Are you plotting
something again, by any chance?

35:30.837 --> 35:33.047
Come on! If you are, take me with you.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.472
Recreation time is over.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.976
All inmates, please move quickly
to your respective cellblock.

35:46.435 --> 35:47.979
I repeat…

35:49.689 --> 35:50.648
But honestly,

35:51.399 --> 35:52.859
I don't believe it either.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.570
Are you for real?

36:01.826 --> 36:04.120
-What's wrong with her?
-It's her daughter.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.538
"Daughter"?

36:06.122 --> 36:09.876
She needs a kidney transplant,
but she can't give her kidney to her.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.506
I didn't think
she had a single tear in her.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.385
But then again,
a child means everything to every parent.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.517
Hey.

36:28.352 --> 36:29.478
Get out of here.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.109
Listen…

36:36.235 --> 36:37.820
Get lost, or I swear to God

36:38.779 --> 36:39.780
I'll strangle you.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.825
What's your daughter's blood type?

36:44.118 --> 36:45.244
If it's possible,

36:46.245 --> 36:48.706
I would like to give
one of my kidneys to your daughter.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.717
What?

37:00.635 --> 37:02.303
Tell me what her blood type is.

37:04.847 --> 37:05.890
AB.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.977
Great. My blood type is AB too.

37:13.272 --> 37:14.232
Is that true?

37:32.291 --> 37:34.502
Mo-mi!

37:39.257 --> 37:42.802
The third round of results is available.
We just received them.

37:42.885 --> 37:45.346
You can give your kidney to my daughter!

37:45.429 --> 37:46.597
-I really can?
-Yes!

37:47.515 --> 37:48.808
It's a total miracle.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.353
Thank you so much.
How can I ever repay you?

37:52.937 --> 37:55.731
There's no need.
I'm so glad it all worked out.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.986
Thank you! Thank you. So much.

38:02.947 --> 38:06.492
Today, we'll be having a special
character development training session

38:06.575 --> 38:07.994
with volunteers from outside.

38:08.077 --> 38:11.414
All day long, they will be giving you
their undivided attention

38:11.497 --> 38:15.751
and also have Bible study with you. If you
have any questions, feel free to ask.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.379
Also, be sure to let out
all that's in your heart.

38:20.464 --> 38:23.009
I committed a lot of crimes
and sins in my life.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.974
You know, I was never, like, happy,
not even for a day.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.519
But, for the past few weeks or so,

38:34.103 --> 38:35.771
I've begun to, uh,

38:36.439 --> 38:39.191
to really find peace in my heart.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.695
I've asked for

38:43.863 --> 38:45.948
forgiveness from the Lord, you see.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.366
That's right.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.869
And no matter what your sin is,

38:49.952 --> 38:51.996
if you ask for it, you will be forgiven.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.041
And God will save your soul.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.418
I know you will also be absolved,

38:58.002 --> 38:58.961
sister Mo-mi.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.341
I'll pray for you.
It was nice meeting you.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.800
Yes. Thank you.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.387
We meet again.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.067
It's me.

39:21.776 --> 39:22.860
Oh-nam Ju's mom.

39:28.074 --> 39:28.908
You got

39:29.575 --> 39:30.701
my letter, right?

39:30.785 --> 39:33.704
You didn't reply.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.206
I was so sad.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.085
I guess you weren't even curious

39:40.378 --> 39:42.129
how I lived all this time.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.046
I was basically

41:06.964 --> 41:08.507
born again that day.

41:10.926 --> 41:11.802
Father God

41:12.928 --> 41:14.930
had given me another life to live!

41:16.515 --> 41:18.851
So I could punish that devil of a bitch.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.564
The police are investigating
a dismembered body

41:23.647 --> 41:26.984
that was found in a compact vehicle
discovered at the bottom of the reservoir.

41:27.067 --> 41:29.570
A local resident
discovered the compact vehicle

41:29.653 --> 41:33.073
that had sunken into a reservoir
in Cheolhyeon-gun yesterday,

41:33.157 --> 41:35.451
around 4 p.m.,
and reported it to the police.

41:35.534 --> 41:38.287
The police are attempting
to identify the body

41:38.370 --> 41:41.332
and track down the owner
of the discovered vehicle.

41:48.214 --> 41:52.176
In order to find that bitch
away from the police's prying eyes,

41:52.259 --> 41:54.637
I also had to change my face.

41:54.720 --> 41:55.846
Just as she did.

42:18.452 --> 42:20.538
Wow!

42:20.621 --> 42:22.665
You are the woman who bought the gun.

42:23.374 --> 42:26.335
You look totally different! Wow!

42:28.504 --> 42:29.838
Oh!

42:32.841 --> 42:34.510
IDENTIFICATION CARD
OH-JU NAM

42:36.428 --> 42:38.430
-Appreciate your work.
-No problem.

42:41.016 --> 42:43.602
I had to get
a new place to live as well.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.941
No one lived here before.

42:49.441 --> 42:51.151
They used this place as a factory,

42:51.235 --> 42:53.445
making all sorts of paste
and salted seafood.

42:57.783 --> 43:00.035
It's interesting, right?

43:01.495 --> 43:03.747
So here, they stored salted seafood.

43:04.707 --> 43:07.835
-You can check it out if you're curious.
-Yeah.

43:11.213 --> 43:12.131
Okay.

43:12.881 --> 43:14.383
I looked all over the country,

43:15.175 --> 43:17.469
every nook and cranny, to find her.

43:18.679 --> 43:19.513
But…

43:20.889 --> 43:22.558
I couldn't find her anywhere.

43:25.519 --> 43:27.896
Mask Girl,
the notorious serial killer,

43:27.980 --> 43:29.440
has finally revealed herself.

43:29.523 --> 43:32.109
Rumor has it she has become addicted
to plastic surgery.

43:32.192 --> 43:34.778
She is now being escorted
into the police station.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.823
MASK GIRL, SUSPECT OF SERIAL MURDERS,
TURNS HERSELF IN

43:37.906 --> 43:40.242
Here. Please give us a comment.

43:45.956 --> 43:47.207
Is this truly…

43:47.916 --> 43:49.418
…your will?

43:53.672 --> 43:55.215
Father.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.220
-At first…
-Hi, Mi-mo!

44:00.304 --> 44:03.223
…I believed that this
was the Lord's sole will

44:03.807 --> 44:06.018
and decided to forget and move on.

44:06.101 --> 44:06.935
Let's go.

44:07.019 --> 44:09.938
-But no matter how much time passed…
-What did you do yesterday?

44:10.022 --> 44:12.566
-…I just couldn't do it.
-Not much. I just stayed home.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.109
When I saw her face,

44:15.069 --> 44:15.903
I saw

44:17.071 --> 44:18.614
that bitch in her.

44:21.116 --> 44:23.869
-Thank you very much.
-Sure. Bye-bye.

44:24.912 --> 44:26.872
Kid. Kiddo!

44:27.456 --> 44:28.499
Come over here.

44:28.582 --> 44:30.751
It's fine, come over. Yes.

44:32.002 --> 44:33.754
Here you go.

44:33.837 --> 44:34.797
Come on.

44:35.381 --> 44:36.340
Have some of this.

44:37.007 --> 44:38.676
I don't have any money, though.

44:38.759 --> 44:42.513
It's fine, don't worry!
It's Granny's treat. You can just eat.

44:43.639 --> 44:47.518
My grandma said not to eat anything
people give to me for free.

44:47.601 --> 44:49.603
Oh, she taught you well.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.397
Bye now.

44:54.316 --> 44:57.903
You must be hungry.

44:57.986 --> 44:59.530
Here, eat up.

44:59.613 --> 45:01.657
It's fine, it's fine. Eat up, eat up.

45:05.035 --> 45:05.869
There.

45:14.002 --> 45:16.338
Wow! I love it. It's so good.

45:17.089 --> 45:18.048
Is that right?

45:18.132 --> 45:21.009
Come on. Eat up now.
If you want more, I'll give you more.

45:21.093 --> 45:23.053
Here. Have this with it as well.

45:23.137 --> 45:27.850
KOREAN FAITH CHURCH

45:29.268 --> 45:31.061
Huh? Good morning, Granny!

45:31.895 --> 45:34.231
Oh my! It's you, Mi-mo!

45:36.608 --> 45:37.443
Hi!

45:38.736 --> 45:41.697
Grandma, this granny
is a tteokbokki truck owner.

45:42.448 --> 45:44.241
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

45:44.742 --> 45:47.453
Oh…
you go to this church, ma'am?

45:47.536 --> 45:51.540
I moved to this neighborhood recently,
so I am attending this church.

45:51.623 --> 45:54.126
-Oh.
-Oh, Ms. Shin. Good morning.

45:54.209 --> 45:55.878
-Good morning.
-Hello, sweetie.

45:55.961 --> 45:58.964
-Hello, ma'am.
-Okay, then. See you next week.

45:59.047 --> 46:01.425
-Yes, see you.
-Bye-bye, Granny!

46:02.760 --> 46:05.220
Come by again
and have some tteokbokki!

46:05.304 --> 46:07.556
-I will!
-Okay.

46:08.390 --> 46:10.684
When I saw that bitch's mom again,

46:10.768 --> 46:14.229
my insides began to boil with rage.

46:14.855 --> 46:17.524
Ladies, I'll give you a lot.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

46:17.608 --> 46:18.817
-Thanks a lot.
-Thanks.

46:20.360 --> 46:24.448
There's a rumor,
but I don't know if it's true or not.

46:24.531 --> 46:25.365
What is it?

46:25.449 --> 46:26.492
Mask Girl's kid

46:27.284 --> 46:29.244
actually goes to this school.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.789
-"Mask Girl"?
-Yeah.

46:31.872 --> 46:34.958
That girl who wore a mask and,
uh, became a murderer.

46:35.042 --> 46:38.462
-She chopped up bodies and went to jail.
-I've heard about Mask Girl!

46:38.545 --> 46:40.923
-She murdered, like, two people.
-Three.

46:41.006 --> 46:42.549
-Three?
-Yeah.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.676
That woman's daughter
goes to the school right now?

46:44.760 --> 46:46.887
I heard she was in first grade.

46:46.970 --> 46:48.180
She had, uh,

46:49.097 --> 46:50.390
a strange name.

46:51.141 --> 46:52.351
What was it, Kim…

46:53.727 --> 46:54.686
Mi-mo?

46:54.770 --> 46:56.605
-Mi-mo?
-Mi-mo?

46:56.688 --> 46:58.941
-Isn't she in our kids' class?
-Oh no!

46:59.024 --> 47:01.193
-Monster's daughter!
-Monster's daughter!

47:05.364 --> 47:07.407
Granny.

47:07.491 --> 47:08.367
What's wrong?

47:09.159 --> 47:10.744
Why are you crying?

47:10.828 --> 47:13.038
'Cause the other kids
are making fun of me.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.962
Listen to me carefully.

47:20.045 --> 47:22.923
From now on,
if someone is being mean to you,

47:23.465 --> 47:26.009
punish them harshly, any way possible.

47:26.093 --> 47:28.512
What? How can I do that?

47:28.595 --> 47:31.723
You have to ensure
they can never do it again.

47:43.610 --> 47:47.906
You're moving?
Oh dear, I'm so sad to see you go.

47:47.990 --> 47:51.326
Don't cry. Granny will go see you often.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.580
-Will you?
-Of course I will.

47:54.663 --> 47:56.331
Just give me your new address.

47:56.915 --> 47:58.750
You really have to come, okay?

47:58.834 --> 48:00.043
Of course.

48:04.006 --> 48:06.675
Oh yes.
Are you guys from the magazine?

48:06.758 --> 48:09.386
Great. I wanted to tip you off.

48:10.554 --> 48:11.471
It's about

48:12.222 --> 48:14.892
Mask Girl's daughter.
Do you want to know more?

48:17.060 --> 48:17.895
You!

48:18.395 --> 48:20.355
Mi-mo's mom, do you know who she is?

48:20.439 --> 48:23.025
Is that loser
from a rich family or something?

48:28.447 --> 48:29.865
You don't know, do you?

48:29.948 --> 48:31.074
What about her?

48:34.995 --> 48:35.829
Forget it.

48:35.913 --> 48:36.914
Are you kidding me?

48:36.997 --> 48:38.498
Ah! Shit!

48:39.666 --> 48:41.043
Come back here!

48:41.126 --> 48:44.671
When I catch you,
you're dead!

48:48.675 --> 48:50.969
Kiddo. Are you all right?

48:52.179 --> 48:54.598
Don't you go
to that middle school right there?

48:55.515 --> 48:56.892
Yeah, so what?

48:57.684 --> 49:01.063
Does a kid named Mi-mo Kim
go there as well?

49:02.606 --> 49:06.068
-How could you?!
-Wait! Why are you doing this?

49:06.151 --> 49:07.569
Please!

49:07.653 --> 49:09.446
You lied to me! You bitch!

49:09.529 --> 49:13.158
Stop it! Listen to me.
I didn't spread any gossip about you--

49:13.241 --> 49:14.952
Shut up, you backstabber!

49:17.996 --> 49:21.041
My God! Mi-mo! What's going on?

49:21.124 --> 49:22.542
Granny, please…

49:22.626 --> 49:26.880
Come in, sweetheart. Quick! My goodness,
you came all the way here alone.

49:41.395 --> 49:42.729
You little devil.

49:44.231 --> 49:47.150
You need to feel
what I've felt all these years.

49:47.234 --> 49:48.568
That heartbreak

49:49.403 --> 49:51.279
when your baby disappears.

49:59.746 --> 50:01.832
I'll keep you in my prayers.

50:08.296 --> 50:10.132
Wait a minute.

50:10.716 --> 50:13.010
-Oh my gosh!
-1047, get away from her!

50:13.093 --> 50:14.594
-Move!
-Do not move.

50:14.678 --> 50:18.223
I can't let that woman leave!
Let go! She can't leave this--

50:18.306 --> 50:20.100
She's mistaking me
for someone else.

50:20.183 --> 50:22.102
She told me
she's going to kill someone!

50:22.185 --> 50:23.979
-Oh my goodness.
-Don't let her go!

50:24.062 --> 50:25.814
-Stay still!
-No, let go!

50:25.897 --> 50:28.608
She's a killer.
If she leaves, she'll kill someone.

50:29.317 --> 50:32.821
That woman is Oh-nam Ju's mother.
I can't let her leave!

50:32.904 --> 50:35.615
-Let go of me, you don't understand!
-Stop moving!

50:35.699 --> 50:39.411
You have to catch her! She's going to
kill someone! You can't let her go!

50:39.494 --> 50:41.079
Stop her!
