WEBVTT

00:04.290 --> 00:06.670
[LUKE] SABRINA MCCARTHY
NEEDS TO GO TO JAIL

00:06.710 --> 00:09.210
FOR THE MURDER OF HER HUSBAND,
TOM MCCARTHY.

00:09.260 --> 00:12.340
ALL THE EVIDENCE
POINTS TO HER.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.220
NOW I, FOR ONE,
WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
FOR A MISTRIAL

00:15.260 --> 00:16.850
BECAUSE WE CAN'T ALL AGREE.

00:16.890 --> 00:18.520
NOW, AFTER ALL THE TIME
WE SPENT DELIBERATING,

00:18.560 --> 00:20.640
WE SHOULD ALL BE
ON THE SAME PAGE NOW.

00:21.940 --> 00:23.140
SO SHALL WE TRY THIS AGAIN?

00:24.690 --> 00:25.940
GUILTY.

00:32.610 --> 00:33.610
NOT GUILTY.

00:40.370 --> 00:42.160
WHAT? YOU TOO, NOW, NORA?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.750
HE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.080
B'YS, JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.880
JUST BECAUSE TOM AND SABRINA
HAD A BAD RELATIONSHIP,

00:47.920 --> 00:50.090
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT SHE KILLED HER HUSBAND.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.710
HOW MANY OF US
WOULD BE IN JAIL

00:51.760 --> 00:53.800
IF WE ENDED
ALL OF OUR ROMANTIC DISPUTES

00:53.840 --> 00:55.510
WITH THE ODD MURDER?

00:55.550 --> 00:57.300
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU LISTEN
TO THE FACTS,

00:57.350 --> 00:58.390
JUROR NUMBER EIGHT?

01:01.270 --> 01:02.850
NOW LET'S DO THIS.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.810
&lt;DRILL BUZZING&gt;

01:16.530 --> 01:18.830
NOW I KNOW WHY YOU
THINK SHE'S INNOCENT.

01:18.870 --> 01:19.910
YOU WANNA SLEEP WITH HER.

01:19.950 --> 01:21.580
&lt;SCOFFS&gt; IT'S PATHETIC.

01:22.370 --> 01:23.370
GET.

01:27.830 --> 01:28.840
WHO'S THAT GUY?

01:30.750 --> 01:32.340
[JAKE] NO IDEA, BUT, YOU KNOW,

01:32.380 --> 01:34.420
HE'S BEEN HERE
EVERY DAY OF THIS TRIAL.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.760
[BAILIFF] ALL RISE.

01:37.550 --> 01:38.850
[JUDGE TIZZARD] B'YS,

01:38.890 --> 01:42.140
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE STILL
AT THAT STUPID RENOVATION.

01:42.180 --> 01:43.180
JUST 'CAUSE
IT'S A GOVERNMENT JOB

01:43.220 --> 01:45.190
DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD TAKE
TWICE AS LONG.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.060
COME ON! WRAP IT UP!

01:47.100 --> 01:48.730
ALRIGHT, SIT DOWN.

01:51.650 --> 01:53.190
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE

01:53.230 --> 01:56.320
THAT YOU CROWD, IN THE JURY,
WILL HAVE FINALLY COME

01:56.360 --> 01:58.240
TO A UNANIMOUS DECISION.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.320
GET TO IT.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.240
-&lt;MAN SCREAMS&gt;
-&lt;CRASHING&gt;

02:00.280 --> 02:01.280
-&lt;CROWD GASPS&gt;
-&lt;COMMOTION&gt;

02:04.450 --> 02:05.710
[MAN] HEY.
[WOMAN] OH, MY--

02:06.790 --> 02:08.040
[JAKE] WHOA, JUST--

02:10.340 --> 02:11.590
YOU WANNA BE A HERO?

02:11.630 --> 02:13.590
&lt;ANGRILY&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, YOUNG LADY?

02:13.630 --> 02:14.670
PUT DOWN THE GUNS.

02:14.710 --> 02:17.260
B'YS, DON'T SHOOT ME, PLEASE.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.720
PUT THEM DOWN
AND THIS GUY WON'T DIE.

02:18.760 --> 02:19.930
JUST DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

02:21.260 --> 02:22.260
BACK UP.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.400
I DIDN'T KILL MY HUSBAND.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.610
I'VE NEVER EVEN
HELD A GUN BEFORE
UNTIL RIGHT NOW,

02:31.650 --> 02:32.730
SO HOW COULD I SHOOT HIM?

02:32.770 --> 02:34.190
WELL, IF YOU'VE NEVER HELD
A GUN BEFORE,

02:34.230 --> 02:35.820
THE THING THAT
YOUR FINGER'S ON
IS CALLED A TRIGGER.

02:35.860 --> 02:37.240
PLEASE DON'T PULL IT.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.240
&lt;WHISPERING&gt; HELP ME. PLEASE.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.780
SOMEONE DO SOMETHING!

02:40.820 --> 02:42.580
[WOMAN] OH, MY GOD.
[MALE COP] YES, YOUR HONOR.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.370
GO AFTER HER!

02:44.410 --> 02:45.410
[FEMALE COP]
I'LL TAKE THE FRONT.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.380
♪ OH YEAH
OH YEAH ♪

02:56.590 --> 02:58.470
♪ OH YEAH
OH YEAH ♪

02:59.510 --> 03:02.390

YEAH-EEE-YEAH-EEE-YEAH ♪

03:02.430 --> 03:05.350
♪ OH YEAH-EEE-
YEAH-EEE-YEAH-EEE-YEAH ♪

03:05.390 --> 03:06.390
♪ OH YEAH ♪

03:08.980 --> 03:12.230
THIS WILL NOT BE A MISTRIAL.

03:12.270 --> 03:14.440
WE ARE DOING THIS.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.400
I-- I DON'T CARE
IF WE HAVE A DEFENDANT OR NOT.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.780
OKAY, NOW, WHERE ARE WE?

03:17.820 --> 03:19.280
WE'RE DEADLOCKED, MY LORD.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.740
NOW I'M SURE THIS ONE HERE
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.830
-DID YOU?
-HE'S THE LONE STAND OUT.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.580
HE'S STARTING A MUTINY
IN THERE.

03:25.620 --> 03:28.290
AND WHY'D SHE CHOOSE YOU
TO BE THE HOSTAGE?

03:28.330 --> 03:29.750
I DON'T KNOW. GOOD TASTE?

03:29.790 --> 03:31.420
UNTIL YOU FIGURE THIS OUT,

03:31.460 --> 03:34.040
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT
A COMMON PRACTICE IN THIS
PROVINCE,

03:34.090 --> 03:36.340
YOU ARE SEQUESTERED.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.670
ALL OF YE, FIX THIS.

03:40.260 --> 03:43.720
RANDALL, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE A
REGULAR AT THESE HEARINGS.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.060
YOUR INTEREST FOR BEING
PRESENT AT HER TRIAL IS?

03:46.100 --> 03:48.140
TO SUPPORT TOM, MY BROTHER.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.480
OR AT LEAST HIS MEMORY.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.440
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN HARD
SINCE HE PASSED.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.560
HE'S REALLY THE BRAINS
BEHIND GALLOWS.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.900
SERGEANT, I'M SORRY,
BUT, HONESTLY,

03:55.940 --> 03:59.320
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
WHERE SABRINA WOULD GO.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.610
-SORRY.
-FINE, BUT WE'LL
BE TALKING AGAIN.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.320
HI THERE.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.160
LISTEN, YOU HAPPEN TO FIND

04:05.200 --> 04:06.780
SABRINA YET, BY ANY CHANCE?

04:06.830 --> 04:08.620
WE'LL GET HER.
NO ONE'S LEAVING THIS BUILDING

04:08.660 --> 04:10.040
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION,

04:10.080 --> 04:13.330
SEEING AS THERE'S A--
AN ALLEGED KILLER
ON THE LOOSE.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.210
ALLEGED, EXACTLY.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.130
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M SURE YOU
WILL FIND HER

04:17.170 --> 04:18.300
BECAUSE YOU'RE EXCELLENT
AT YOUR JOB,

04:18.340 --> 04:20.260
BUT, LISTEN, I WAS JUST
GONNA SAY THAT

04:20.300 --> 04:23.130
THIS WHOLE CASE
IS PRETTY CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.720
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I AM DYING IN THERE.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.390
I COULD USE
ANY BIT OF INFORMATION

04:26.430 --> 04:27.850
THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT HAVE.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.640
BAILIFF?

04:29.680 --> 04:30.850
TAKE HIM AWAY, PLEASE.

04:30.890 --> 04:32.270
NO, NO, LOOK, LESLIE. LESLIE.

04:32.310 --> 04:33.520
THE MURDER WEAPON,
OKAY?

04:33.560 --> 04:34.690
YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA FIND
THE MURDER WEAPON.

04:34.730 --> 04:36.360
WE NEED THAT GUN, SO...

04:36.400 --> 04:39.110
YOU KNOW, WE NEVER THOUGHT

04:39.150 --> 04:40.570
TO LOOK FOR A GUN.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.280
THANKS, JAKE.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.200
BYE BYE.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.330
OKAY, WELL, I'M COMIN'!

04:47.370 --> 04:49.410
WELL, THAT WAS--

04:49.450 --> 04:50.750
THAT WAS DRAMATIC.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.870
BUT, UH, DON'T WORRY.
I'M OKAY.

04:52.910 --> 04:54.170
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.960
THAT'S MY SEAT, NUMBER EIGHT.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.920
HAND OVER YOUR PHONES
TO THE BAILIFF.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.460
MARKING YOUR TERRITORY,
I GET IT.

05:00.510 --> 05:01.550
DON'T WORRY, BOSS,

05:01.590 --> 05:03.470
WE ALL KNOW YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.470
RULES, ALL MEALS
WILL BE BROUGHT IN.

05:07.510 --> 05:09.260
BATHROOM BREAKS,
ONLY ONE PERSON

05:09.310 --> 05:10.560
OUT OF THE ROOM AT A TIME.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.430
AND THERE WILL BE
NO PHONE CALLS UNSUPERVISED.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.310
IF WE COME UP
WITH A UNANIMOUS VERDICT,

05:15.350 --> 05:16.560
WE ALL GET TO GO HOME.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.520
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
ANY QUESTIONS?

05:18.560 --> 05:19.610
YEAH.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.190
SAY YOU'VE GOT, LIKE,
A MEDICAL CONDITION

05:21.230 --> 05:22.740
AND YOU NEED MEDICATION.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.410
IT'S A LIFE OR DEATH KIND OF
THING, YOU KNOW?

05:25.450 --> 05:26.820
SO, WHAT DO YOU DO THEN?

05:26.860 --> 05:28.370
SOMEONE COULD
BRING IT IN FOR YOU.

05:28.410 --> 05:30.200
&lt;SNAPS FINGERS&gt; DEADLY.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.580
BECAUSE I'VE GOT THIS ALLERGY
THING THAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.370
I-- I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S HAPPENING
TO ANYONE ELSE,

05:34.410 --> 05:35.960
BUT IT'S REALLY
HITTING MY HEAD.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.880
YOUR COLOGNE IS TRIGGERING IT.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.380
-&lt;PEOPLE CHUCKLE&gt;
-IT SMELLS HORRIBLE.

05:39.420 --> 05:41.170
IT'S LIKE
"EAU DE KARATE BRUTAL".

05:42.050 --> 05:43.760
ANYWAYS, I'LL GO MAKE A CALL

05:43.800 --> 05:46.010
AND, UH, GET SOMEONE
TO BRING IT IN FOR ME, EH B'Y?

05:48.760 --> 05:50.180
SUPERVISED.

05:50.220 --> 05:51.970
YOU GOT IT... BOSS.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.350
BAILIFF?

06:02.730 --> 06:04.320
-HARD AT IT, SON?
-YES.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.610
I'M STUDYING, UH, BECAUSE
A MAN WITH AN EDUCATION...

06:06.650 --> 06:09.160
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;
-...GOES TO PLACES
WHERE THERE ARE NO BOUNDS.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.490
DAD? HEY, HOW YA DOING?

06:11.530 --> 06:12.910
LISTEN, I, UH--
I NEED A FAVOR.

06:12.950 --> 06:14.330
&lt;MAL ON THE PHONE&gt;
SORRY, SON. NOT IN THE MOOD

06:14.370 --> 06:15.580
TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

06:15.620 --> 06:17.170
I WON'T BOTHER
TO MAKE UP AN EXCUSE.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.210
BYE.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.130
&lt;DES ON THE PHONE&gt;
JAKE, DO YOU THINK
I'M HANDSOME?

06:22.170 --> 06:25.510
I MEAN, WOULD YOU CLASSIFY ME
AS, OH...

06:25.550 --> 06:26.590
AN ATTRACTIVE MAN?

06:27.340 --> 06:29.640
YES, DES,
YOU'RE VERY HANDSOME.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.800
&lt;JAKE ON THE PHONE&gt;
NOW LISTEN TO ME, CAREFULLY.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.640
I'M AT THE COURT HOUSE.
I NEED YOU TO COME DOWN HERE

06:33.680 --> 06:36.730
AND BRING ME MY
ALLERGY MEDICATION

06:36.770 --> 06:38.480
IN THE BATHROOM,
BY THE CABINET.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.100
WHAT? YOU--
YOU HAVE ALLERGIES?

06:40.150 --> 06:42.270
THAT'S ANOTHER THING
THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.730
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO TAKE THIS.
WHEN DID THEY START?

06:43.770 --> 06:46.360
DES, SHUT UP.
I AM CURRENTLY
SEQUESTERED ON A JURY,

06:46.400 --> 06:48.240
AND I CAN ONLY HAVE
ACCESS TO

06:48.280 --> 06:50.070
LIFE AND DEATH MEDICATION,

06:50.110 --> 06:51.160
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

06:51.200 --> 06:53.660
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE TALKING TO ME IN CODE.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.450
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
OF THIS MOMENT.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.950
SHUT UP AND GET DOWN HERE.
I'M TIMING YOU.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.120
OKAY.

06:59.170 --> 07:01.080
YOU ALL SAW WHAT HAPPENED.

07:01.130 --> 07:03.340
SABRINA DID NOT HELP HER CASE.

07:03.380 --> 07:06.800
IF YOU HAD ANY DOUBTS BEFORE,
THIS SHOULD ERASE IT.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.630
ONLY GUILTY PEOPLE RUN.

07:08.670 --> 07:11.800
OH, COME ON. DESPERATE PEOPLE
RUN TOO, RIGHT?

07:11.840 --> 07:15.100
SHE HELD A SAW TO YOUR THROAT
AND A GUN TO YOUR BACK.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.390
AND EVEN AFTER ALL THAT,

07:16.430 --> 07:18.270
YOU'RE STILL CONVINCED
SHE'S NOT GUILTY?

07:18.310 --> 07:20.020
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT MAYBE
SHE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE

07:20.060 --> 07:21.770
SHE WAS GETTING
A FAIR SHAKE IN HERE.

07:21.810 --> 07:23.480
ESPECIALLY WITH, UH,
TOOL-HAND LUKE HERE...

07:23.520 --> 07:24.650
-&lt;PEOPLE CHUCKLE&gt;
-...AT THE HELM.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.860
LET'S PIECE THIS TOGETHER
BIT BY BIT.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.900
NO, NO! HEY, LOOK,
I'M THE FOREMAN HERE.

07:28.950 --> 07:31.320
OKAY, RELAX BUDDY.
WE ALL KNOW THAT
YOU'RE THE FOREMAN.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.490
YES. NOW...

07:32.530 --> 07:35.490
THE POLICE SAY
THAT WHOEVER KILLED TOM

07:35.530 --> 07:38.290
USED A PILLOW
TO MUFFLE THE GUNSHOT.

07:38.330 --> 07:39.540
SO, LET ME ASK YOU,

07:39.580 --> 07:42.380
DOES SABRINA MCCARTHY
STRIKE YOU AS THE TYPE

07:42.420 --> 07:44.920
THAT WOULD KILL SOMEONE
EXECUTION STYLE?

07:45.920 --> 07:46.920
NO.

07:49.170 --> 07:51.340
ME EITHER. THAT BRINGS ME
TO MY NEXT POINT.

07:52.260 --> 07:53.890
SABRINA SAYS, SHE CAME HOME,

07:53.930 --> 07:56.010
SHE TRIPPED OVER
TOM'S DEAD BODY,

07:56.060 --> 07:58.310
AND THAT'S HOW SHE ENDED UP
COVERED IN BLOOD, RIGHT?

07:58.350 --> 08:00.100
IF YOU CAME HOME
LATE AT NIGHT,

08:00.140 --> 08:02.230
DECIDED TO KILL YOUR SPOUSE,

08:02.270 --> 08:03.520
WOULD YOU JUST SIT THERE,

08:03.560 --> 08:05.150
WAIT FOR THE COPS TO
SHOW UP,

08:05.190 --> 08:07.320
COVERED IN YOUR VICTIM'S
BLOOD?

08:07.360 --> 08:09.900
-I WOULDN'T.
-I WOULDN'T, EITHER.

08:09.940 --> 08:12.200
THAT BRINGS ME TO THE GUN.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.160
HUMOR ME,
MISTER, UH, FOREMAN.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.620
DID THEY FIND THE GUN?

08:16.660 --> 08:17.740
NO THEY DIDN'T.

08:17.790 --> 08:20.120
WHICH MEANS SHE DID
A GREAT JOB OF
GETTING RID OF IT.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.670
NOT IN THE HOUSE, SHE DIDN'T.
THE POLICE CHECKED EVERYWHERE.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.790
YOU SEE,
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GUN,

08:25.840 --> 08:27.670
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF.

08:27.710 --> 08:28.710
MOTIVE.

08:28.750 --> 08:32.680
SHE STOOD TO GAIN A FORTUNE
FROM THE GALLOWS BREWERY

08:32.720 --> 08:34.760
NOW THAT HER HUSBAND IS DEAD.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.600
[JAKE] NOW LET ME ASK YOU,
LET ME ASK ALL OF YOU.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.640
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE,
ANYONE IN THE WORLD

08:38.680 --> 08:41.350
BESIDES SABRINA,
WHO COULD BENEFIT
FROM TOM'S DEATH?

08:42.980 --> 08:44.520
LOOKING FOR ME?

08:44.560 --> 08:45.690
OKAY, I GOTTA GO.

08:45.730 --> 08:48.860
I'LL, UH, SEE YOU AROUND.
FILE THOSE FOR ME.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.480
[DES] OH, HEY, HEY.
I BROUGHT YOU
SOME DECENT FOOD.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.650
I KNOW HOW BAD
PRISON FOOD CAN BE.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.610
I'M NOT IN JAIL, DES.

08:53.650 --> 08:55.870
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; THE SECURITY
AROUND HERE IS INTENSE.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.490
THEY WERE GONNA
PAT DOWN THE SANDWICH.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.580
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

09:01.830 --> 09:03.080
COLON CARE PILLS?

09:03.120 --> 09:04.620
WELL, THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I COULD FIND

09:04.670 --> 09:06.630
IN THE OFFICE BATHROOM.

09:06.670 --> 09:09.590
SO, UH--
OH, FYI, THEY ARE EXPIRED.

09:09.630 --> 09:12.420
OKAY, LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH INFORMATION
ON THIS CASE

09:12.470 --> 09:14.550
AND I'M GONNA
NEED YOUR HELP.

09:15.340 --> 09:17.430
I'M THE MAN OF THE HOUR.
AND HOURS.

09:17.470 --> 09:19.890
WELL, WHATEVER YOU
NEED ME TO BE REALLY--
I'M ON IT.

09:19.930 --> 09:21.810
JUST DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU'RE
HELPING ME.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.020
OKAY, LOOK.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.560
YOU SEE THIS GUY BEHIND YOU?

09:25.600 --> 09:27.900
DON'T STARE RIGHT AT HIM.

09:27.940 --> 09:29.570
I NEED YOU TO
GO OVER TO HIM RIGHT NOW

09:29.610 --> 09:31.320
AND FIND OUT ANYTHING YOU CAN.
GO. NOW.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.030
-GO, GO, GO. GO.
-OKAY.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.620
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt; HEY! HEY...

09:37.660 --> 09:41.290
GERRY. HEY, MAN!
GERRY, IT'S ME.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.620
RICARDO. HEY.

09:44.660 --> 09:45.870
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.630
GERRY. GER-MAN. GER.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.590
BUDDY, MY NAME'S OWEN.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.130
NOW GO AWAY, WILL YA?

09:55.170 --> 09:56.220
&lt;CAMERA CLICKS&gt;

09:57.680 --> 10:00.220
THAT WAS...
PATHETIC.

10:00.260 --> 10:02.680
HEY, AT LEAST I FOUND OUT THAT
HIS NAME IS OWEN,

10:02.720 --> 10:04.350
AND THAT HE
IS A VERY TENSE MAN.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.350
HEY, YOU GOT A PHOTO.

10:08.310 --> 10:09.690
GOODBYE NOW.

10:09.730 --> 10:10.730
MY PHONE, MY PHONE.
MY PHONE!

10:11.650 --> 10:12.650
&lt;CELL PHONE KEYS BEEPING&gt;

10:14.240 --> 10:16.450
WELL, OWEN, BUDDY.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.030
WHAT IS YOUR STORY?

10:18.070 --> 10:19.070
&lt;STALL DOOR OPENS&gt;

10:23.290 --> 10:25.120
I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU WERE GONNA SHOW UP.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.130
LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

10:34.170 --> 10:38.380
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; YOU ARE
IN SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE HERE.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.050
&lt;WHISPERS&gt; SHH!
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

10:41.510 --> 10:43.100
&lt;PANTING&gt;

10:43.140 --> 10:45.430
NOW, I WANT TO HELP YOU.
I DO,

10:45.470 --> 10:48.440
BUT I REALLY DON'T APPRECIATE
HAVING A GUN STUCK IN MY FACE.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.520
SORRY,

10:49.560 --> 10:51.440
BUT IF YOU DON'T
GIVE ME BACK THAT GUN...

10:53.690 --> 10:55.740
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.700
ALRIGHT, REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
ABOUT NOT LIKING

10:57.740 --> 10:58.860
HAVING A GUN STUCK IN MY FACE?

10:58.900 --> 11:00.110
-MM-HMM.
-WELL, THERE'S ONE THING
I LIKE

11:00.160 --> 11:01.660
A LOT LESS THAN THAT,
AND THAT'S ANYTHING SHARP

11:01.700 --> 11:02.700
STUCK IN THAT REGION.

11:02.740 --> 11:03.740
THE GUN.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.410
COPY.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.290
THANK YOU.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.790
LET'S GO.

11:14.170 --> 11:15.550
[JAKE]
YOU ARE TAKING A BIT OF RISK,

11:15.590 --> 11:17.260
SHOWING YOUR FACE
IN PUBLIC LIKE THIS.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.340
I MEAN, YOU'RE PLASTERED

11:18.380 --> 11:19.760
ON EVERY NEWS STATION
IN THE PROVINCE.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.470
PLUS, WE'RE LITERALLY
RETURNING TO THE SCENE
OF THE CRIME.

11:22.510 --> 11:24.640
-YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
-I NEED TO FIND
A MURDER WEAPON.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.390
SOMETHING, ANYTHING
TO CLEAR ME.

11:28.430 --> 11:30.020
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED, TOM HAD
COMPLAINED TO THE COPS

11:30.060 --> 11:31.600
THAT SOMEONE WAS AFTER HIM.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.940
I'M SORRY,
BUT ISN'T THAT RANDALL?

11:33.980 --> 11:35.730
IS THAT YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW?
WHAT'S HE DOING?

11:36.730 --> 11:37.860
LOOKS LIKE
HE'S CLEANING ME OUT.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.110
HE'S STEALING FROM YOU?

11:39.150 --> 11:40.950
WHAT, DOES HE NEED MONEY
OR SOMETHING?

11:40.990 --> 11:42.160
HE GETS EVERYTHING
FROM TOM'S WILL

11:42.200 --> 11:43.370
IF I GO TO JAIL.

11:43.410 --> 11:44.410
&lt;CAR ENGINE STARTS&gt;

11:50.750 --> 11:52.370
WOW.

11:53.750 --> 11:54.920
THIS IS A NICE PLACE.

11:58.090 --> 11:59.720
THAT'S QUITE THE
BROTHER-IN-LAW YOU HAVE.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.800
YEAH, I NEVER REALLY
LIKED HIM.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.510
DIDN'T THINK
HE'D STOOP SO LOW THOUGH.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.350
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

12:07.390 --> 12:09.060
-WHAT?
-I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT IS,

12:09.100 --> 12:11.060
BUT I STUDIED
THOSE CRIME PHOTOS

12:11.100 --> 12:13.400
AND, AND, AND
THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING
IN THIS ROOM.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.150
I NEED TO GET CHANGED,

12:16.190 --> 12:18.980
BUT OBVIOUSLY I NEED TO
KEEP AN EYE ON YOU TOO,

12:19.030 --> 12:20.570
SO, LOOK AWAY, JAKE.

12:20.860 --> 12:21.990
OF COURSE, I--

12:22.030 --> 12:23.910
-YEAH. LOOKING...
-THANKS.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.760
THERE'S NO BULLETS
IN THIS GUN.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.970
YEAH.

12:42.010 --> 12:43.880
I HATE GUNS.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.890
BUT MOSTLY BULLETS.

12:45.930 --> 12:46.930
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; ME TOO.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.810
OH, SORRY. JUST--

12:50.430 --> 12:52.430
I'M NOT LOOKING.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.020
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD GET
CHANGED IN THE OTHER--

12:54.060 --> 12:54.900
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.650
SORRY.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.860
HEY, DES, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

12:59.900 --> 13:01.990
OH HEY, UM, UH, NOTHING.

13:02.030 --> 13:04.070
UH, THIS IT'S JUST UM-- UH--

13:04.110 --> 13:05.820
ISN'T THAT SABRINA MCCARTHY?

13:05.860 --> 13:08.780
YEAH. YEAH. JAKE HAS ME
HELPING HIM FROM THE OUTSIDE.

13:08.830 --> 13:12.000
JAKE'S GOT YOU INVESTIGATING
THE CASE HE'S A JUROR ON?

13:12.040 --> 13:13.330
WHAT ELSE DOES HE HAVE YOU
DOING FOR HIM?

13:13.370 --> 13:15.830
NOTHING. THAT'S IT.
JUST THE PIC. ZERO. NADA.

13:15.870 --> 13:17.290
WELL, I SUPPOSE
IT'S KIND OF NICE

13:17.330 --> 13:18.790
-THAT HE'S TRYING TO HELP
THIS GIRL OUT.
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

13:18.840 --> 13:20.920
NOT TOO BRIGHT,
BUT NICE ALL THE SAME.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.800
HOW IS IT THAT YOU'RE CALLING
ME RIGHT NOW, DES?

13:25.840 --> 13:28.300
UM, JAKE COMMANDEERED
MY PHONE,

13:28.350 --> 13:30.180
I WAS BOUND BY LAW.

13:30.220 --> 13:31.890
YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

13:31.930 --> 13:33.180
LISTEN, I NEED YOUR HELP.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.390
ISN'T SABRINA'S LAWYER
SUPPOSED TO BE HANDLING THIS?

13:35.440 --> 13:38.400
YEAH, WELL I'M KIND OF AT
SABRINA MCCARTHY'S HOUSE...

13:39.230 --> 13:40.980
WITH SABRINA MCCARTHY.

13:41.030 --> 13:44.650
OH GOOD. RUNNING AROUND
WITH A FUGITIVE MURDERER NOW.
EXCELLENT.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.780
I HOPE YOU'RE VERY HAPPY
TOGETHER.

13:47.820 --> 13:51.580
&lt;JAKE ON THE PHONE&gt;
DAD, MY GUT IS TELLING ME SHE
DIDN'T DO THIS, OKAY?

13:51.620 --> 13:53.330
I NEED YOU TO CHECK
RANDALL MCCARTHY'S ALIBI

13:53.370 --> 13:55.080
THE NIGHT THAT TOM WAS KILLED.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.880
I MEAN, I JUST SAW THE GUY
STEALING FROM HIS DEAD
BROTHER'S HOUSE.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.130
THERE'S SOMETHING
NOT RIGHT WITH HIM.

13:59.170 --> 14:00.210
OKAY, DONE.

14:00.250 --> 14:02.000
OH, UH, SO OWEN...

14:03.130 --> 14:04.880
DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE
FROM GALLOW'S

14:04.920 --> 14:07.180
AND TOM MCCARTHY,
WHO FIRED HIM

14:07.220 --> 14:08.890
JUST A FEW DAYS
BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED.

14:08.930 --> 14:11.930
OWEN TRIED TO FILE
A WORKER'S COMP CLAIM
FOR AN EYE INJURY,

14:11.970 --> 14:12.970
BUT MCCARTHY WOULDN'T SIGN.

14:13.850 --> 14:15.600
TURN AROUND. NOW.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.650
&lt;DES ON PHONE&gt;
AND THIS OWEN GUY LOOKS LIKE A
TOTAL SKETCH BAG

14:17.690 --> 14:18.900
IF YOU ASK ME.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.610
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS PRETTY
ACCURATE.

14:20.650 --> 14:22.070
PUT THE PHONE DOWN.

14:22.110 --> 14:23.400
AND THE GUN.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.030
AND THE PHONE. I SAID THAT.

14:26.070 --> 14:27.360
LOOK, JUST DO IT, LUH!

14:27.400 --> 14:29.490
OKAY, I'M PUTTING
THE PHONE DOWN.

14:29.530 --> 14:30.780
I'M, UH--

14:31.160 --> 14:32.160
JAKE?

14:33.910 --> 14:35.040
YOU'RE OWEN.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.040
AM I RIGHT? YOU--

14:37.080 --> 14:38.750
-&lt;SCREAMS&gt;
-&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;

14:39.790 --> 14:40.790
&lt;GUN SHOTS HEARD
OVER THE PHONE&gt;

14:41.380 --> 14:42.380
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

14:45.380 --> 14:47.010
SABRINA, GET OUT OF HERE!

14:50.050 --> 14:51.050
&lt;JAKE GRUNTS&gt;

14:54.560 --> 14:56.020
WE GOTTA FIND SABRINA,
ALL RIGHT?

14:56.060 --> 14:57.850
THIS OWEN GUY?
HE'S A REAL WING-NUT,

14:57.890 --> 14:59.140
AND I THINK HE'S OUT
TO HURT HER.

14:59.190 --> 15:02.020
YOU KNOW, IF OWEN IS A
DISGRUNTLED
EMPLOYEE-GONE-MADMAN

15:02.060 --> 15:03.610
HE MIGHT HAVE DESIGNS
ON THE WHOLE FAMILY,

15:03.650 --> 15:06.030
AND HE GOT A TASTE FOR IT
WHEN HE KILLED TOM MCCARTHY

15:06.070 --> 15:07.860
IN A FIT OF RAGE.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.150
CHECK THIS OUT. THIS IS WEIRD.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.910
OWEN IS STILL ON THE PAYROLL
AT GALLOWS

15:10.950 --> 15:13.280
AND RANDALL IS THE ONE
SIGNING HIS PAYCHECKS.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.490
SO WHAT ARE WE THINKING,
THIS IS SOME KIND OF PAY OFF?

15:15.540 --> 15:17.660
WHATEVER IT IS, WE'LL FIGURE
IT OUT.

15:17.710 --> 15:18.960
YOU GET BACK
TO THAT COURTHOUSE

15:19.000 --> 15:21.080
BEFORE THERE'S A
CITY-WIDE SEARCH OUT
FOR YOU TOO.

15:21.130 --> 15:22.290
-DAD!
-NO JAKE.

15:22.330 --> 15:24.210
THE BEST CHANCE SHE HAS
IS A SOLID DEFENSE

15:24.250 --> 15:25.710
IN THAT DELIBERATION ROOM,

15:25.750 --> 15:27.670
AND THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
FIGHTING FOR HER BESIDES YOU.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.220
-NOW GO.
-ALRIGHT, FINE.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.510
BUT FIRST, I NEED YOU TO GIVE
THIS TO LESLIE.

15:31.550 --> 15:33.850
-&lt;MAL SCOFFS&gt;
-NO, THERE'S A...

15:33.890 --> 15:35.810
THERE'S A GUN IN HERE,
AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE

15:35.850 --> 15:38.640
THE MURDER WEAPON
THAT KILLED TOM.

15:39.180 --> 15:40.730
OKAY. GO.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.150
YOU UP FOR A DRINK
AND A CHAT

15:46.190 --> 15:47.820
WITH MR. RANDALL MCCARTHY?

15:47.860 --> 15:49.740
WHY, DES COURTNEY,

15:49.780 --> 15:50.990
ARE YOU ASKING ME OUT
ON A DATE?

15:51.410 --> 15:52.740
UH...

15:56.790 --> 15:57.870
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

15:57.910 --> 15:59.080
&lt;GROANING&gt;

15:59.120 --> 16:00.790
YOU'RE NOT IN HERE TRYING TO
GET SOME CANDID SNAPS

16:00.830 --> 16:03.000
OF ME FOR THE SCOPE
MAGAZINE OR SOMETHING,
ARE YOU?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.840
OH, NO, NO, NO,
YOUR PRECIOUS. NO.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.630
THE, UH, THE BAILIFF TELLS ME
THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE

16:06.670 --> 16:08.510
-FOR OVER AN HOUR.
-YEAH.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.050
&lt;GROANING&gt; YEAH.

16:10.090 --> 16:13.050
I HAVE, UH, COLON ISSUES.

16:13.090 --> 16:15.510
LIKE YOU SAID,
I'VE BEEN GONE A LONG TIME,

16:15.550 --> 16:18.020
SO I SHOULD GET BACK
INTO THAT ROOM

16:18.060 --> 16:19.480
AND GET YOU A VERDICT.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.110
[RANDALL]
ALRIGHT, LADIES, PACK IT UP,

16:27.150 --> 16:28.440
THE CROWD IS GONNA
BE HERE SOON.

16:35.070 --> 16:36.490
OKAY, LET ME HANDLE THIS.

16:38.990 --> 16:42.040
&lt;IN DEEP VOICE&gt;
EXCUSE ME, RANDALL.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.040
YOU MUST BE THE GUY
WHO CALLED ABOUT THE CAR.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.250
LET'S GO TAKE AT LOOK AT HER.

16:45.290 --> 16:48.170
BRAND NEW BEEMER, MAN,
ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES.

16:48.210 --> 16:49.840
A COMPLETE STEAL FOR 15 GRAND.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.510
WE'RE INDEPENDENT
PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS.

16:51.550 --> 16:53.260
WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE DEATH
OF YOUR BROTHER.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.260
REALLY?
I THOUGHT THAT INVESTIGATION
WAS OVER A LONG TIME AGO.

16:56.300 --> 16:59.350
OFFICIALLY, YES, BUT CAN WE
ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS?

16:59.390 --> 17:01.810
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt; DO YOU THINK
SABRINA KILLED TOM?

17:01.850 --> 17:05.190
SABRINA? WELL, THE COPS
THINK SO, BUT--

17:05.230 --> 17:06.770
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM?

17:06.810 --> 17:09.070
NO, I DIDN'T.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIS VOICE?

17:09.110 --> 17:10.480
[ROSE] YOU KNOW, I'D SAY
IT'S PUBERTY,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.070
-BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S REACHED IT YET.
-&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt; I'M SORRY.

17:12.110 --> 17:13.740
&lt;NORMAL VOICE&gt; WHERE WERE YOU
THE NIGHT TOM WAS KILLED?

17:13.780 --> 17:16.320
WE JUST NEED LOCATION
AND DETAILS AND ALL THAT.

17:16.370 --> 17:19.540
I WAS AT THE GALLOWS PROMO
TILL ABOUT 3 A.M.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.250
AND THEN, YOU CAN GO AND ASK
THE REST OF THE 200 PEOPLE

17:22.290 --> 17:23.080
THAT WERE THERE.

17:23.120 --> 17:24.870
WHAT ABOUT, UH, OWEN BANKS?

17:26.960 --> 17:28.040
YOU KNOW HIM?

17:29.170 --> 17:31.170
OWEN? HE LOST HIS JOB
AT THE BREWERY.

17:31.210 --> 17:32.340
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.800
-REALLY?
-SORRY.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.220
OH, THAT'S WILD,
BECAUSE HE'S STILL
ON YOUR PAYROLL.

17:36.260 --> 17:38.760
GUESS I'LL HAVE TO ASK
ACCOUNTING ABOUT THAT.

17:39.510 --> 17:41.140
LINDA, YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE.

17:41.180 --> 17:42.220
STACK THOSE KEGS!

17:42.270 --> 17:43.680
I GUESS WE'LL LET
ACCOUNTING TELL HIM

17:43.730 --> 17:45.560
HIS COMPANY ASSETS
HAVE BEEN FROZEN.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.020
GO TO THE OFFICE
AND FILL MAL IN.

17:47.060 --> 17:48.650
I GOTTA GRAB SOMETHING
FROM THE HOUSE.

17:48.690 --> 17:50.110
&lt;IN DEEP VOICE&gt; ROGER THAT.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.490
SORRY.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.410
YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR
OVER AN HOUR.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.870
YEAH. UH, SORRY EVERYONE.
SORRY.

17:58.910 --> 18:00.530
I-- I KINDA GOT LOST.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.990
-BUT IT'S ALL GOOD NOW.
-NO.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.660
THERE'S NOTHING GOOD
ABOUT THIS, DOYLE.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.540
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GET YOU GONE OFF
THIS JURY.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.000
YOU MARK MY WORDS.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.880
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT NOW, LUKE?

18:08.920 --> 18:11.300
HEY, CAN WE JUST
GET BACK TO IT, PLEASE?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.630
ABSOLUTELY.

18:12.670 --> 18:14.170
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGS&gt;

18:15.340 --> 18:18.340
IS-- IS THAT A PHONE?

18:18.390 --> 18:22.140
PHONE? PHONE? A PHONE?
OH MY...

18:22.180 --> 18:24.430
LOOK AT THAT! IT-- THERE IS--
IT IS A PHONE.

18:24.470 --> 18:28.940
GIMME... GIVE ME THE--
GIVE ME THE PHONE!

18:28.980 --> 18:30.770
ALRIGHT, B'Y, ALRIGHT. RELAX.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.270
YOU ARE UPTIGHT, BUT YOU'RE--

18:32.320 --> 18:34.190
YOU'RE VERY,
VERY GOOD AT YOUR JOB.

18:34.230 --> 18:36.650
I SHOULD HIRE YOU.
YOU KNOW, I--

18:36.700 --> 18:39.320
I OWN MY OWN BUSINESS.
I'M A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

18:42.660 --> 18:45.200
WHAT IS THIS FOOLISH
MATHEMATICAL EQUATION
DOING UP HERE?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.870
WHAT HAPPENED TO
ALL THE PICTURES?

18:46.910 --> 18:48.370
-HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.
-&lt;MOANS&gt;

18:48.420 --> 18:50.000
I THINK I'VE FOUND
TWO MORE PEOPLE

18:50.040 --> 18:53.210
WHO MAY HAVE A MOTIVE
TO KILL TOM.

18:55.130 --> 18:56.220
RANDALL MCCARTHY

18:58.090 --> 18:59.260
AND OWEN BANKS.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.680
NICE ART WORK.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.180
WELL, THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT
EXACT LIKENESSES,
BUT THEY'LL DO.

19:03.220 --> 19:05.180
NOW OWEN BANKS
WAS FIRED FROM
GALLOWS BREWERY

19:05.220 --> 19:07.890
JUST TWO DAYS
BEFORE TOM WAS KILLED.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.020
AND RANDALL MCCARTHY--

19:09.060 --> 19:11.310
NOW RANDALL
IS THE DECEASED'S BROTHER,

19:11.360 --> 19:13.070
BUT GUESS WHAT.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.190
IF SABRINA IS CONVICTED
FOR THE MURDER
OF TOM MCCARTHY,

19:16.230 --> 19:17.990
RANDALL INHERITS EVERYTHING.

19:21.070 --> 19:22.120
MOTIVE?

19:22.160 --> 19:23.830
WASHROOM BREAK.

19:23.870 --> 19:25.790
AND MR. HOT-SHOT HERE
HAD A PHONE.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.120
YEAH, I FOUND IT IN THE
BATHROOM.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.250
I WAS GONNA RETURN IT.

19:28.290 --> 19:30.330
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,

19:30.370 --> 19:31.460
I PROPOSE WE GO BACK

19:31.500 --> 19:33.130
AND WE START
AT THE VERY BEGINNING.

19:33.170 --> 19:34.590
-WHAT DO YOU SAY?
-OH, MAN.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.300
AGAIN?

19:37.460 --> 19:39.550
GOT A BIT OF A SITUATION, EH?

19:39.590 --> 19:41.130
THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY.

19:42.300 --> 19:43.680
HOW CAN I HELP YOU, MALACHY?

19:43.720 --> 19:46.600
THIS CAME MY WAY TODAY
AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT
BRING IT TO YOU.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.650
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?

19:55.690 --> 19:57.900
I DON'T KNOW. ANONYMOUS.

19:57.940 --> 20:00.320
WEIRD THINGS
JUST HAPPEN SOMETIMES.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.990
I SAW JAKE EARLIER.

20:02.030 --> 20:04.490
HE SAID I NEEDED TO FIND
A MISSING GUN,

20:04.530 --> 20:07.870
AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY SHOW UP
WITH A GUN.

20:07.910 --> 20:09.960
I KNOW. WEIRD.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.370
WHAT ARE THE ODDS THIS HAS
SOMETHING TO DO

20:11.420 --> 20:13.290
WITH THE MCCARTHY TRIAL?

20:13.330 --> 20:15.380
TELL ME WHAT
ALL THIS IS ABOUT, MALACHY.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.210
START TALKING.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.050
[KATHLEEN] HELLO?
ANYONE HOME?

20:26.430 --> 20:28.930
WHERE CAN I PUT THIS
SO THE BRAINTRUST
CAN'T FIND IT?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.320
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

20:41.150 --> 20:43.240
-HEY!
-HEY! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME?

20:43.280 --> 20:44.870
OH, I WAS LOOKING
FOR DAD ACTUALLY.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.160
UH, HAVE YOU SEEN HIM AROUND?

20:47.200 --> 20:49.080
NO, I THINK
HE'S AT THE OFFICE.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.660
-&lt;SIGHS&gt;
-ANYTHING I CAN DO?

20:50.700 --> 20:54.040
NO. JUST, UH,
IT WAS A SMALL THING.
JUST--

20:54.080 --> 20:55.580
REALLY, KATHLEEN,
'CAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE

20:55.630 --> 20:57.290
YOU'RE ABOUT TO JUMP OUT
OF YOUR SKIN?

20:57.340 --> 20:59.670
OH. YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T SLEEP AT ALL
LAST NIGHT.

20:59.710 --> 21:00.920
-IT WAS JUST--
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

21:00.960 --> 21:03.800
YEAH, I THINK I'M
OVER-TIRED OR SOMETHING.

21:04.510 --> 21:05.300
YEAH.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.390
YOU GONNA GET
THE PHONE? YOUR PHONE.

21:10.430 --> 21:13.140
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; OH, MY PHONE. YEAH.

21:14.770 --> 21:16.310
WALTER, AGAIN.

21:16.350 --> 21:18.440
-OH.
-I GOTTA RUN, ROSE.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.690
SO, UH, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

21:19.730 --> 21:21.320
-OKAY.
-SEE YOU LATER, ROSE.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.610
BYE.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.240
OKAY, WHO HERE STILL THINKS
THAT SABRINA IS GUILTY?

21:29.870 --> 21:32.500
HONESTLY, I NEVER REALLY
BELIEVED SHE WAS GUILTY.

21:32.540 --> 21:34.540
WELL, SEVEN
OF THESE PEOPLE DO,

21:34.580 --> 21:38.040
AND IF WE COUNT OUR GOOD
FOREMAN'S VOTE,

21:38.090 --> 21:39.500
THAT BRINGS US TO EIGHT.

21:41.420 --> 21:42.510
GET OUT OF MY SEAT.

21:43.550 --> 21:44.760
MAN,

21:44.800 --> 21:47.220
WHAT IS WITH YOU
AND THE WHOLE SEAT THING?

21:47.260 --> 21:49.430
AND TELL US ALL,
WHY ARE YOU SO INTENT

21:49.470 --> 21:51.310
ON CONVICTING SABRINA?

21:51.350 --> 21:53.520
AND WHY ARE YOU SO INTENT
ON LETTING HER GO? HUH?

21:53.560 --> 21:56.230
YOU'RE THE ONLY HOLD OUT.
EVERYBODY ELSE HERE
WAS WITH ME.

21:56.270 --> 21:58.270
YEAH, WELL I'M NOT WITH YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE A BULLY,

21:58.310 --> 22:00.400
AND LIKE ALL BULLY DICK-HEADS,

22:00.440 --> 22:03.440
WHENEVER YOU ARE CONFRONTED
YOU WILL BACK DOWN.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.360
-&lt;JAKE GRUNTS&gt;
-&lt;PEOPLE GASP&gt;

22:07.740 --> 22:09.120
[WOMAN] OH, MY GOD.

22:10.490 --> 22:11.910
IT'S ALRIGHT EVERYONE.
IT'S OKAY.

22:11.950 --> 22:13.450
HE'S A BULLY, REMEMBER?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.960
AND ANY MINUTE
HE IS GONNA RUN AWAY.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
-&lt;GRUNTS&gt;
-&lt;PEOPLE GASP&gt;

22:19.580 --> 22:20.920
[WOMAN] WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?

22:20.960 --> 22:22.170
&lt;PEOPLE MUMBLING&gt;

22:22.210 --> 22:23.460
[NORA] OKAY. STOP.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.130
I THINK WE SHOULD ASK
THE BAILIFF
IF WE CAN TAKE FIVE.

22:26.170 --> 22:29.550
IT'S GETTING A LITTLE
TESTOSTERONE HEAVY IN HERE.

22:29.590 --> 22:30.890
&lt;GROANS&gt;

22:30.930 --> 22:32.430
OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.390
I, UH--

22:34.430 --> 22:35.850
BATHROOM BREAK!

22:35.890 --> 22:36.980
YEAH.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.400
THIS AIN'T OVER.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.440
YEAH.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.570
[DES] HEY, MAL?

22:43.610 --> 22:45.900
HEY, UH, IS MAL AROUND?

22:45.940 --> 22:48.160
DON'T KNOW. DON'T CARE.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.410
ARE YOU OKAY?

22:50.450 --> 22:51.580
OF COURSE, I AM.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.330
I ALWAYS AM.

22:53.370 --> 22:54.580
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE--

22:54.620 --> 22:56.330
YOU'RE LIKE ACTUALLY SAD.

22:56.370 --> 22:58.460
CAN YOU JUST SHUT UP FOR ONCE
AND GIVE ME A HUG?

22:58.710 --> 22:59.710
OKAY.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.960
UM...

23:03.000 --> 23:04.590
IT'LL BE OKAY.

23:04.630 --> 23:06.630
-THERE THERE.
-SHUT UP.

23:06.670 --> 23:07.630
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

23:07.670 --> 23:09.630
OKAY, SO WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE NOT TALKING ABOUT?

23:09.680 --> 23:12.390
I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST--

23:12.430 --> 23:13.600
I'M GETTING
THE SNEAKING SUSPICION

23:13.640 --> 23:15.520
THAT MOM IS ABOUT TO
BOLT AGAIN.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.640
OH, TIN--
NO, SHE'S HAPPY HERE, TINNY.

23:18.690 --> 23:21.440
I'M-- I'M SURE IT'S FINE.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.980
THANK YOU.

23:23.020 --> 23:24.610
TELL ANYONE
YOU SAW ME LIKE THIS,

23:24.650 --> 23:26.490
AND I'LL TEAR YOUR SKIN OFF.

23:26.820 --> 23:27.820
NICE.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.740
PLEASE DON'T TEAR
MY SKIN OFF.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.620
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

23:35.490 --> 23:37.200
THERE THERE.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.960
-SHUT UP.
-OKAY.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.670
&lt;LUKE ON RECORDER&gt;
LOOK, MOSTLY EVERYONE'S
ON MY SIDE

23:40.710 --> 23:41.920
EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE
MORON.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.880
HE'S MAKING IT
DIFFICULT FOR ME.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.000
I UNDERSTAND.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.510
A GUILTY VERDICT
IS THE BEST OUTCOME,

23:46.550 --> 23:48.380
BUT IT SHOULDN'T
CHANGE OUR DEAL.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.550
OKAY, OKAY, FINE, FINE.

23:50.590 --> 23:52.260
-I'LL DO MY BEST.
-&lt;TURNS RECORDER OFF&gt;

23:52.300 --> 23:53.720
NOW WHO WERE YOU
ON THE PHONE WITH?

23:53.760 --> 23:54.760
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

23:55.760 --> 23:57.470
AGAIN WITH THE BATHROOM,
MR. DOYLE?

23:57.520 --> 24:00.020
YEAH. THE MEDICATION I'M ON,
IT'S REALLY,

24:00.060 --> 24:02.600
YOU KNOW,
CAUSING A LOT OF PROBLEMS
WITH MY SYSTEM.

24:03.230 --> 24:04.980
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

24:05.020 --> 24:06.610
JURORS ARE NOT MEANT TO
HAVE CONTACT

24:06.650 --> 24:10.650
WITH THE PRESIDING JUDGE
DURING DELIBERATION,
MR. DOYLE.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.490
AND YOU MAY WISH TO LEAVE
BEFORE YOU FACE

24:12.530 --> 24:15.120
A CONTEMPT OF COURT CHARGE.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.580
YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED,

24:16.620 --> 24:18.580
BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY THE MOST
PATIENT OF MEN.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.580
JUDGE TIZZARD, I AM NOT TRYING
TO BE DIFFICULT HERE.

24:20.620 --> 24:24.330
WHO-- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU
ARE, HENRY FONDA?

24:24.380 --> 24:26.000
IN HERE,
TRYING TO CHANGE THE MINDS

24:26.040 --> 24:28.050
OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
WHO JUST DON'T CARE?

24:28.760 --> 24:29.840
LOOK,

24:29.880 --> 24:32.840
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT,
UH, SOMEONE IN THERE

24:32.880 --> 24:35.260
IS REALLY PUSHING HARD
FOR A GUILTY VERDICT.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.720
OH, THAT'S ODD,

24:36.760 --> 24:39.220
AS MY SOURCES TELL ME THAT
YOU ARE THE SQUEAKY WHEEL
IN THERE,

24:39.270 --> 24:41.890
HOLDING UP
A PERFECTLY SOUND VERDICT.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.100
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THERE'S SOME AGENDA

24:44.150 --> 24:46.570
-AGAINST SABRINA
AND THIS ENTIRE CASE.
-&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

24:46.610 --> 24:49.480
AND YOU DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA,
MR. DOYLE?

24:49.530 --> 24:51.570
NOW JUST TELL ME, WHAT, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW,

24:51.610 --> 24:53.610
RIGHT HERE-- TALKING TO ME?
HUH?

24:54.700 --> 24:56.120
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

24:56.160 --> 24:57.780
I AM SO SORRY. OH.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.410
THIS COLD MEDICATION THING
THAT I'M ON,

25:00.450 --> 25:02.540
-IT'S REALLY
CAUSING A HAVOC--
-JUST GET OUT!

25:02.580 --> 25:05.250
GET OUT OF THIS BATHROOM!
JUST GET OUT!

25:05.290 --> 25:07.170
OKAY. LISTEN, YOU'RE DOING
A GREAT JOB, BY THE WAY.

25:07.210 --> 25:10.590
SORRY. COORDINATION'S OFF,
IT'S-- &lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

25:12.840 --> 25:15.470
MAL, YOU GOTTA TELL ME
WHERE YOU FOUND THE GUN.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.470
YOU MIGHT WANNA TALK TO A MAN
NAMED OWEN BANKS.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.730
HE MAY HAVE HAD IT LAST.

25:22.770 --> 25:25.190
-JAKE TOLD YOU THIS?
-LESLIE,

25:25.230 --> 25:27.900
I KNOW MORE THAN MOST HOW MUCH
OF A MESS JAKE CAN BE.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.150
BUT HE WOULDN'T BE
TRYING TO PREVENT

25:29.190 --> 25:30.480
THIS GIRL FROM
GOING TO JAIL

25:30.530 --> 25:32.940
IF HE WASN'T SURE
SHE WAS INNOCENT.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.860
LOOK, YOU HAVE THE MURDER
WEAPON NOW,

25:34.900 --> 25:37.700
SO YOU CAN TALK TO THIS
OWEN BANKS CHARACTER.

25:37.740 --> 25:39.740
EXCEPT THIS ISN'T THE MURDER
WEAPON.

25:39.780 --> 25:42.250
THIS IS THE GUN THAT SHOT
MCCARTHY IN THE ARSE.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.500
-THERE WERE TWO GUNS?
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

25:43.540 --> 25:44.750
YEAH.

25:44.790 --> 25:46.210
YOU BETTER GET THAT.

25:46.250 --> 25:47.880
AND YOU CAN GO, PLEASE.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.670
-DAD.
-&lt;MAL ON THE PHONE&gt;
J.B. TIZZARD?

25:52.710 --> 25:54.760
YOU STOLE
THE JUDGE'S CELL PHONE?

25:54.800 --> 25:56.180
STOP. PLEASE. OKAY?

25:56.220 --> 25:58.180
I'M HIDING IN A BROOM CLOSET.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.600
I NEED YOU TO LOOK
INTO LUKE SHAW.

25:59.640 --> 26:00.680
I KNOW HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.600
THAT GUN YOU FOUND
ISN'T THE MURDER WEAPON.

26:02.640 --> 26:03.930
THERE'S A SECOND GUN.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.850
YOU MEAN THE GUN THAT
KILLED TOM IS STILL OUT THERE?

26:05.890 --> 26:08.060
AND THERE ARE TWO SHOOTERS.
MAYBE.

26:08.480 --> 26:09.610
ALRIGHT.

26:09.650 --> 26:11.020
LISTEN, I GOTTA GO.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.650
HOPEFULLY, WHEN WE TALK
NEXT TIME,

26:12.690 --> 26:14.240
YOU'LL HAVE
FOUND OUR FRIEND SABRINA.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.320
ALRIGHT? GOODBYE.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.700
OKAY.

26:27.670 --> 26:28.670
&lt;KNOCKING ON DOOR&gt;

26:44.100 --> 26:45.730
-[SABRINA] HI.
-HI, UH--

26:48.850 --> 26:50.770
IS THIS WHERE
JAKE DOYLE LIVES?

26:50.810 --> 26:52.820
UH, YEAH. SOMETIMES.

26:52.860 --> 26:54.530
ARE YOU A FRIEND OF HIS?

26:54.570 --> 26:56.650
HE'S ACTUALLY WORKING
A CASE FOR ME.

26:56.690 --> 26:58.820
-UH.
-SOME-- WHO ARE YOU?

26:58.860 --> 27:00.450
-KATHLEEN. I'M, UH--
-RIGHT.

27:00.490 --> 27:02.120
HIS SISTER, ACTUALLY.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.910
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;
YOU WANT A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

27:03.950 --> 27:06.410
OH MY GOD, YEAH.
I'D LOVE A DRINK. THANK YOU.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.710
GREAT.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.620
-AHH!
-AHH!

27:10.750 --> 27:11.920
&lt;ANGRILY&gt; WHAT DO YOU WANT?

27:11.960 --> 27:13.340
YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME THIS TIME.

27:13.380 --> 27:14.630
YOU GET OUT
OF MY HOUSE, BUDDY,

27:14.670 --> 27:16.840
OR I WILL CUT YOU, I SWEAR.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.880
I WOULDN'T
CALL HER BLUFF, OWEN.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.260
COPS ARE GOING TO BE HERE
IN ABOUT 45 SECONDS.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.890
YOU'RE ALREADY OUTNUMBERED.

27:22.930 --> 27:24.430
SO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

27:24.470 --> 27:27.270
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

27:27.310 --> 27:28.600
I'M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.640
GET OUT!

27:32.770 --> 27:33.820
YOU LADIES OKAY?

27:33.860 --> 27:35.570
YEAH, I THINK SO.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.740
PROBABLY SHOULD GET YOU BACK
TO THE OFFICE, SABRINA, RIGHT?

27:37.780 --> 27:39.740
HEY, NOT THE FIRST GUY
WHO REALIZED

27:39.780 --> 27:41.530
HE COULDN'T MESS WITH
KATHLEEN DOYLE.

27:41.570 --> 27:42.820
YOU DID OKAY, DEAR.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.910
THANK YOU FOR THE USE
OF YOUR PHONE, JUDGE TIZZARD.

27:47.950 --> 27:48.960
&lt;DOOR KNOB MOVING&gt;

27:50.040 --> 27:51.170
&lt;LAUGHTER&gt;

27:52.790 --> 27:55.800
-YEAH.
-OH.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.840
&lt;MOANING&gt;

27:58.050 --> 27:59.300
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS ALL DAY.

27:59.340 --> 28:01.010
OH, ME TOO.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.140
MMMM.

28:07.180 --> 28:08.930
WHAT IF SOMEONE COMES IN?

28:09.480 --> 28:10.480
THEY WON'T.

28:11.060 --> 28:13.190
HI!

28:13.230 --> 28:15.900
THIS IS A SURPRISE,
I HAVE TO SAY.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.440
CARRY ON.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.780
[JAKE]
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE NOT IN
THE BACKSEAT OF YOUR CAR

28:22.820 --> 28:24.780
AT A DRIVE-IN IN MOUNT PEARL,
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

28:24.820 --> 28:27.580
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
IT'S-- IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR--

28:27.620 --> 28:29.540
FOR THIS KIND OF THING
TO HAPPEN.

28:29.580 --> 28:30.910
OH, WHEN YOU GET
TENSE, STRESSED,

28:30.960 --> 28:33.290
YOUR PANTS JUST SPONTANEOUSLY
DROP TO THE FLOOR, DO THEY?

28:33.330 --> 28:36.210
IT'S JUST BEING TOGETHER
IN THAT LITTLE ROOM ALL DAY,

28:36.250 --> 28:38.460
SIDE BY SIDE,
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN.

28:38.510 --> 28:41.930
UH, WE'VE ONLY BEEN
SEQUESTERED FOR, LIKE,
A FEW HOURS.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.840
L-- L-- LOOK, WHAT HAPPENS ON
THE JURY TRIAL,

28:44.890 --> 28:47.850
STAYS ON THE JURY TRIAL.

28:47.890 --> 28:50.430
AND IT'S OUR WORD
AGAINST YOURS.

28:57.570 --> 29:00.110
PLEASE DON'T SAY
ANYTHING, JAKE.

29:00.150 --> 29:01.860
I DON'T KNOW, NORA.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.240
FROM THE OUTSIDE,
IT LOOKS LIKE

29:03.280 --> 29:06.070
YOU TWO MIGHT BE IN ON
SOMETHING TOGETHER.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.410
NO, NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.

29:07.450 --> 29:10.290
JUST, TRYING TO CHANGE
HIS MIND.

29:11.160 --> 29:12.660
I'M NOT CONVINCED.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.790
WAIT. OKAY, LOOK.

29:14.830 --> 29:17.420
WHAT ABOUT MONEY?
I CAN GET YOU MONEY.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.340
UM,

29:19.380 --> 29:21.590
I KNOW A GUY
WILLING TO PAY FOR
NOT GUILTY VOTES.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.510
WHAT?
WOULD YOU, UM--

29:24.550 --> 29:25.970
SORRY.

29:26.010 --> 29:27.100
&lt;TURNS RECORDER ON&gt;

29:27.140 --> 29:29.720
WOULD YOU MIND, UH,
REPEATING THAT?

29:29.760 --> 29:32.520
I KNOW A GUY WILLING TO PAY
FOR NOT GUILTY VOTES.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.770
REALLY?

29:33.810 --> 29:34.980
HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT HERE?

29:35.020 --> 29:36.440
15 THOUSAND A PIECE.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.860
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HE
PROMISED.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.360
$15,000?

29:40.400 --> 29:41.990
YOU GOT A NAME?
WHO IS HE?

29:42.030 --> 29:43.280
I DON'T KNOW.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.450
HE CALLED THIS MORNING.
HE SOUNDED REAL PANICKED.

29:45.490 --> 29:47.950
OH. THAT'S ONE WAY
TO CHANGE SOMEONE'S MIND, HUH?

29:48.990 --> 29:51.580
15 THOUSAND IS 15 THOUSAND.

29:51.620 --> 29:54.410
AND HERE ALL THIS TIME
I THOUGHT IT WAS
MY SOUND LOGIC

29:54.460 --> 29:57.250
AND POSSIBLY A LITTLE BIT OF
CHARM THAT BROUGHT YOU AROUND.

29:59.170 --> 30:01.340
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO
ADD FOR THE RECORD?

30:01.380 --> 30:03.010
OH, DAMN.

30:03.050 --> 30:05.800
WHO IS THIS OWEN BANKS TO YOU,
SABRINA?

30:05.840 --> 30:06.970
[SABRINA] NO ONE.

30:07.010 --> 30:08.430
I DON'T KNOW THE MAN.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.310
NOT EVEN FROM THE BREWERY?

30:10.350 --> 30:12.100
I DIDN'T GO THERE OFTEN.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.600
IT WAS TOM'S PLACE.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.730
SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHY
OWEN IS AFTER YOU?

30:15.770 --> 30:17.600
BECAUSE HE'S PRETTY
DETERMINED.

30:17.650 --> 30:18.650
AND RELENTLESS.

30:19.270 --> 30:20.860
I HAVE NO IDEA, MR. DOYLE.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.200
I THINK
SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.280
YEAH, ME TOO.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.320
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO STAKE-OUT
HER HOUSE AGAIN.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.200
IF OWEN
FOUND HER THERE BEFORE--

30:31.240 --> 30:32.830
HE MAY EXPECT TO
FIND HER THERE AGAIN.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.790
-DES?
-YES?

30:35.830 --> 30:37.920
WE'RE GONNA GO WATCH
SABRINA'S HOUSE FOR A BIT.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.250
HOLD DOWN THE FORT, OKAY?

30:40.460 --> 30:41.960
YOU GOT IT.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.880
OKAY, SO, UH,

30:44.920 --> 30:47.220
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?
I MEAN WE CAN TALK
PERSONAL MATTERS,

30:47.260 --> 30:49.840
MONEY MATTERS, CASE MATTERS,
OR WE CAN PLAY CRIBBAGE.

30:49.890 --> 30:50.930
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30:52.970 --> 30:53.970
&lt;NORA ON THE RECORDER&gt;
15 THOUSAND A PIECE.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.020
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
HE PROMISED.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.940
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE
NUMBER OF CHARGES

31:00.980 --> 31:02.980
YOU'RE FACING, YOUNG LADY?

31:03.020 --> 31:05.900
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE,
TAKING BRIBES,

31:05.940 --> 31:07.360
INTERFERING WITH A JURY?

31:07.400 --> 31:08.490
I'M SO SORRY, MY LORD.

31:08.530 --> 31:11.320
-PLEASE, I'LL DO ANYTHING.
-CLEARLY.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.290
NORA FLEET, YOU ARE EXCUSED
FROM ANY FURTHER DUTY.

31:14.830 --> 31:16.120
NOW GO HOME.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.590
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT THE JURY TAMPERING

31:22.630 --> 31:24.170
DOESN'T END WITH OUR FRIEND,
NORA THERE.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.510
ON THAT, WE AGREE.

31:26.550 --> 31:30.470
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHY YOU WERE RECORDING A JURY?

31:30.510 --> 31:32.640
THAT ISN'T MINE, OKAY?
I BROUGHT IT TO YOU.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.560
I FOUND IT IN
THE DELIBERATION ROOM.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.640
SURE YOU DID.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.480
AND-- AND YOU GOT SOMETHING
ON IT

31:37.520 --> 31:40.270
THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS WORTH
SHARING WITH SOMEONE.

31:40.310 --> 31:43.060
UH, YOU WERE CLEVER ENOUGH TO
ERASE THE HISTORY,

31:43.110 --> 31:45.190
BUT I CHECKED
MY PHONE RECORDS ONLINE

31:45.230 --> 31:46.690
AND THERE WAS ONE CALL
THERE ABOUT--

31:46.730 --> 31:49.450
ABOUT A MINUTE-AND-A-HALF
TO MALACHY DOYLE.

31:49.490 --> 31:52.450
I GUESS YOU WERE MISSING
YOUR DADDY, WERE YOU?

31:52.490 --> 31:55.450
WE'RE VERY, VERY CLOSE.
AND, UH, UH--

31:55.490 --> 31:58.040
YOU KNOW, HE'S REALLY OLD.
HE COULD DIE ANY MINUTE, SO--

32:00.120 --> 32:02.420
I WARNED YOU.
YOU'RE OFF THIS JURY.

32:02.460 --> 32:04.670
I COULD STILL GET A VERDICT
FROM 10 JURORS,

32:04.710 --> 32:06.590
AND I INTEND TO.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.170
GOODBYE.

32:10.090 --> 32:12.720
HI, EVERYONE. DON'T WORRY.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.680
I'M JUST HERE TO SAY GOODBYE
AND, YOU KNOW,

32:14.720 --> 32:18.060
SIGN UP FOR THE JURY REUNION
OR WHATEVER.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.390
YEAH, WELL, GOOD RIDDANCE.

32:19.430 --> 32:21.190
FINALLY SOME JUSTICE
BEING SERVED.

32:21.230 --> 32:23.020
I SEE NEWS TRAVELS FAST,
DON'T IT?

32:23.060 --> 32:25.310
YEAH, WELL FINALLY WE CAN WRAP
THIS BAD-BOY UP.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.690
YEAH, WELL, I WOULDN'T
REST ON MY LAURELS YET, BUDDY.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.780
I THINK OUR JURY IS STILL OUT
ON THIS ONE.

32:31.820 --> 32:33.740
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE--

32:33.780 --> 32:34.910
OH MY GOD,
LOOK AT THAT!

32:36.910 --> 32:39.500
THOUGHT SOMETHING. SEE YA.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. CHEERS.

32:40.830 --> 32:42.000
[ROSE] YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
VERY PROUD

32:42.040 --> 32:43.750
OF YOUR DAUGHTER TODAY,
MALACHY.

32:43.790 --> 32:45.000
I AM EVERY DAY.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.880
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.250
YOU GOT SOME
PRETTY FEARLESS KIDS.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.340
YEAH.

32:49.380 --> 32:51.630
AND, HISTORICALLY,
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY

32:51.670 --> 32:53.590
PROVEN TO BE A
GOOD THING.

32:53.630 --> 32:56.180
KATHLEEN SEEMED, UM,
OUT OF SORTS TODAY.

32:56.220 --> 32:57.390
YEAH, I SUPPOSE SHE WAS

32:57.430 --> 32:59.270
SINCE THAT MANIAC
WALKED INTO OUR HOUSE.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.060
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I SAW HER BEFORE THAT.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.020
SHE SEEMED--
I DON'T KNOW, STRANGE.

33:05.060 --> 33:07.320
EVERYTHING ALRIGHT, MAL?
DO YOU KNOW?

33:07.360 --> 33:09.150
PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO
WITH WORK.

33:09.190 --> 33:10.190
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGS&gt;

33:13.280 --> 33:15.530
JAKE.
FIRED AGAIN.

33:15.570 --> 33:18.160
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. LISTEN.
THAT JUDGE? HE WANTED ME GONE.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.700
MMM-HMM.
I KNOW THE FEELING.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.080
SO NOW WHO'S GONNA BE
ON SABRINA'S SIDE

33:21.120 --> 33:22.460
IN THAT JURY ROOM?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.040
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE GOTTA FIND
MORE EVIDENCE.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.040
&lt;MAL ON PHONE&gt;
IT LOOKS LIKE RANDALL
MIGHT BE TRYING TO BLOW TOWN,

33:26.080 --> 33:27.420
TRYING TO RAISE SOME CASH.

33:27.460 --> 33:31.130
HE TRIED TO SELL HIS
$80,000 CAR TO DES
FOR 15 GRAND.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.470
DID YOU JUST SAY $15,000?

33:34.550 --> 33:36.470
THERE WAS A, UH--

33:36.510 --> 33:38.100
THERE WAS A JUROR
BEING BOUGHT OFF

33:38.140 --> 33:39.100
FOR THAT EXACT AMOUNT.

33:39.140 --> 33:41.810
SO RANDALL WAS TRYING TO
ENSURE SABRINA GOES TO JAIL?

33:41.850 --> 33:42.930
&lt;JAKE ON THE PHONE&gt;
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

33:42.980 --> 33:45.100
I THINK HE WAS BUYING
AN INNOCENT VOTE.

33:45.140 --> 33:46.600
HE'S TRYING TO HELP SABRINA?

33:46.650 --> 33:48.770
DAD, I GOTTA GO.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.780
&lt;DES GROANING&gt;

33:56.240 --> 33:57.160
DES.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.410
&lt;INDISTINCT&gt; OW!

34:02.450 --> 34:04.000
OW! WHAT-- OW!

34:04.040 --> 34:06.250
OH, ACTUALLY THAT'S PROBABLY
GOOD FOR EXFOLIATION.
DO IT AGAIN.

34:06.290 --> 34:07.750
WHERE IS SABRINA?

34:07.790 --> 34:09.170
MAN, I-- LOOK, I--
I DON'T KNOW.

34:09.210 --> 34:11.090
I DID NOT SEE HER COMING.
SHE-- SHE--
SHE WAS SUPER STRONG,

34:11.130 --> 34:12.760
-MOVES LIKE A CHEETAH--
-DES.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.260
&lt;SIGHS&gt; SHE'S GONE.
SABRINA ESCAPED.

34:16.970 --> 34:17.970
&lt;MOANS&gt;

34:20.100 --> 34:22.140
SO, WHAT DO WE GOT
ON LUKE, THE FOREMAN?

34:22.180 --> 34:24.730
NOT MUCH. NO CRIMINAL RECORD.
SQUEAKY CLEAN.

34:24.770 --> 34:26.100
HE'S WORKING
SOME KIND OF ANGLE.

34:26.140 --> 34:27.190
WE JUST GOTTA FIGURE OUT WHAT.

34:27.230 --> 34:28.650
WHY IS HE STILL TAPED UP?

34:29.480 --> 34:30.820
WELL, HE'S...

34:30.860 --> 34:32.780
YOU KNOW, GOTTA THINK ABOUT
WHAT HE DID WRONG.

34:33.230 --> 34:34.320
UNTAPE HIM.

34:35.610 --> 34:36.820
MMM. MMM.

34:38.950 --> 34:41.200
OW, B'Y!

34:41.240 --> 34:42.290
-ALTHOUGH, THE EXFOLI--
-SHUT UP.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.330
OKAY GUYS, CHECK THIS OUT.

34:43.370 --> 34:45.200
I WAS TALKING TO MY FRIEND
OVER AT THE SHOOTING RANGE.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.290
SHE SAYS THAT TOM MCCARTHY
WAS THERE ALMOST EVERY DAY

34:47.330 --> 34:48.620
BEFORE HE DIED.

34:48.670 --> 34:50.040
LOOKS LIKE TOM DID OWN A GUN.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.000
YEAH, BUT SABRINA INSISTED
THAT THEY DIDN'T.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.130
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

34:53.170 --> 34:54.300
[ROSE] OKAY, SO MAYBE,

34:54.340 --> 34:56.920
RANDALL IS PAYING OWEN
AFTER HE'S FIRED.

34:56.970 --> 34:58.720
MAYBE THE TWO OF THEM
CONSPIRED TO KILL TOM

34:58.760 --> 35:00.220
AND FRAME SABRINA.

35:00.260 --> 35:03.430
WHY WOULD RANDALL PAY
FOR A NOT GUILTY VOTE?
GUILTY CONSCIENCE?

35:03.470 --> 35:05.640
ALSO GOT OWEN'S
CELL PHONE RECORDS.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.940
CALLS MADE TO TOM
BEFORE HE DIED.

35:07.980 --> 35:11.110
DOZENS AND DOZENS OF CALLS
LASTING ONLY SECONDS.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.770
-WERE THEY HANG-UPS?
-[ROSE] LOOKS LIKE IT.

35:12.820 --> 35:14.150
THE KIND OF THING THAT'LL
MAKE YOU PARANOID,

35:14.190 --> 35:15.150
LIKE SOMEONE'S AFTER YOU.

35:15.190 --> 35:16.570
SO MUCH SO THAT
YOU MIGHT BUY A GUN.

35:16.610 --> 35:18.320
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
SABRINA WAS, UH...

35:18.360 --> 35:20.450
SHE WAS YELLING AT SOMEONE
ON THE PHONE, ON THE LANDLINE.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.080
-UH, OKAY.
-&lt;KEYPAD BEEPING&gt;

35:24.120 --> 35:25.830
-PUT IT ON SPEAKER PHONE.
-ALRIGHT.

35:25.870 --> 35:28.080
[SABRINA] YOU'VE REACHED
THE HIGHWAY LOUNGE
ON GEORGE STREET.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.620
TONIGHT WE'RE HOSTING
A GALLOWS BEER EVENT...

35:29.670 --> 35:31.500
THAT'S THE SAME BAR THAT,
UH, WE...WE TALKED TO RANDALL.

35:31.540 --> 35:33.750
HE MUST HAVE TAKEN
SABRINA THERE. PLEASE LET ME
GO WITH YOU, JAKE.

35:33.790 --> 35:35.420
I ALREADY GOT
A READ ON THIS WEASEL.
COME ON!

35:35.460 --> 35:37.840
TAKE HIM. UNTAPE HIM.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.090
-OKAY. YOU CAN GO.
-OH, THANKS.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.260
DES.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.850
-MOST DARK.
-TURN ON THE LIGHT.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.310
OKAY, SO RANDALL

35:52.230 --> 35:53.980
PAYS OFF OWEN,

35:54.020 --> 35:56.780
AND THEN HE TRIES TO
BUY SABRINA'S INNOCENCE,

35:56.820 --> 35:59.200
AND THEN SHE RUNS
TO RANDALL...

35:59.240 --> 36:01.780
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE ALL
IN CAHOOTS TO TRY TO, UH...

36:01.820 --> 36:03.240
-IN TOM'S MURDER?
-WHAT?

36:05.450 --> 36:06.950
WELL LOOK AT THIS.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.200
[SABRINA]
JAKE, I'M REALLY SORRY.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.750
DES, SORRY FOR TYING YOU UP.

36:10.790 --> 36:12.330
THAT'S COOL.

36:12.380 --> 36:13.920
I'M IN LOVE WITH RANDALL.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.630
DOESN'T MEAN
I KILLED MY HUSBAND.

36:15.670 --> 36:18.420
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH RANDALL?
THAT IS NOT FIT.

36:18.460 --> 36:20.590
SO I'M GUESSING THAT, UH,
YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT

36:20.630 --> 36:22.300
THIS GUY,
YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND HERE,

36:23.220 --> 36:25.260
HE PAID OWEN TO
TERRORIZE YOUR HUSBAND.

36:27.100 --> 36:30.480
RANDALL, WE GOT PROOF THAT YOU
PAID OWEN TO HARASS TOM.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.900
RANDALL, DID YOU KILL
MY HUSBAND? YOUR OWN BROTHER?

36:34.940 --> 36:38.070
NO! NO, NO.
UH, OWEN WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO KILL TOM.

36:38.110 --> 36:42.660
I JUST WANTED TO SCARE HIM
SO HE'D SELL HIS SHARE
OF THE BUSINESS TO ME.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.700
OWEN WAS THE REASON THAT
TOM WAS SO FREAKED OUT?

36:45.870 --> 36:48.410
HE WAS SLEEPING WITH
A BASEBALL BAT UNDER HIS BED.

36:49.330 --> 36:50.290
AND NOW HE'S DEAD?

36:51.500 --> 36:52.920
FOR THE BUSINESS?

36:52.960 --> 36:55.670
I KNOW. BUT HE...
HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE.

36:55.710 --> 36:57.380
YOU LET ME GO THROUGH A TRIAL.

36:57.420 --> 37:01.470
ALL THAT TIME THAT I SPENT
LOCKED UP, AND YOU KNEW
THAT I DIDN'T KILL TOM.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.510
I DID. AND I TRIED TO
PAY OFF A JUROR, AND...

37:03.550 --> 37:05.430
-AND I WENT BROKE DOING IT.
-WAIT, WAIT.

37:05.470 --> 37:08.220
YOU DECIDED TO PAY OFF
THE JUROR AS OPPOSED TO,

37:08.260 --> 37:11.730
I DON'T KNOW, USE THAT MONEY
TO HELP HER GET
A BETTER LAWYER MAYBE?

37:11.770 --> 37:13.640
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A BETTER PLAN.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.310
OR MAYBE JUST TELL THE COPS
THAT OWEN IS GUILTY.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.860
WELL, YEAH, I'M NOT SO SURE...

37:17.900 --> 37:19.110
-ALRIGHT.
-OH, GOD!

37:20.400 --> 37:23.990
NOBODY IS GOING NOWHERE NOW.

37:24.030 --> 37:26.070
NOT WITHOUT THAT ONE
GOING BACK TO TRIAL.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.280
SHE'S MY TICKET OUT.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.870
YOU KILLED MY BROTHER.

37:28.910 --> 37:31.160
I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM.
YOU KNOWS THAT.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.620
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.330
I STOOD IN THE DOORWAY

37:34.370 --> 37:36.420
AND I AIMED FOR
THE LAMP, AND...

37:36.460 --> 37:39.500
IT'S OKAY, BUDDY. I KNOW
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

37:39.550 --> 37:40.340
YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO SHOOT HIM...

37:41.420 --> 37:42.550
IN THE ASS.

37:42.590 --> 37:44.430
JUST GIVE ME THE KNIFE.

37:45.470 --> 37:47.510
GIVE ME THE KNIFE.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.310
I DON'T THINK THAT
THIS GUY KILLED TOM.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.770
THEN WHO DID?

37:58.560 --> 37:59.900
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

37:59.940 --> 38:02.650
&lt;ALL MURMURING&gt;

38:02.690 --> 38:05.200
THE JURY WILL BE BACK WITH
A VERDICT WITHIN THE HOUR.

38:07.490 --> 38:10.410
SO YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA
GO DOWN FOR MURDER
THAT SHE DIDN'T COMMIT?

38:10.870 --> 38:12.540
I DON'T KNOW. LOOK,

38:12.580 --> 38:15.370
TOM WAS HIDING A GUN
SOMEWHERE IN THAT HOUSE.

38:15.410 --> 38:16.960
-I NEED TO GO HAVE
ANOTHER LOOK.
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

38:17.000 --> 38:19.040
THEN LET'S GO, RIGHT NOW,
DOUBLE TIME,

38:19.090 --> 38:20.840
BECAUSE WE
DON'T HAVE MUCH... TIME.

38:22.590 --> 38:23.630
-ROSE?
-[ROSE] HEY, LISTEN,

38:23.670 --> 38:24.920
THERE'S THIS NEW CABLE NETWORK

38:24.970 --> 38:26.380
PREMIERING A NEW SHOW
NEXT MONTH,

38:26.430 --> 38:27.720
CALLED "FOR WHOM
THE GAVEL TOLLS".

38:27.760 --> 38:31.260
IT'S A DOCUSERIES ABOUT
CANADA'S MOST
NOTORIOUS MURDER TRIALS.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.180
AND LET ME GUESS.
SOMEONE I KNOW IS INVOLVED?

38:33.220 --> 38:35.890
WELL, THE SHOW HAPPENS TO BE
WRITTEN BY A LUKE SHAW,

38:35.940 --> 38:36.980
YOUR FOREMAN.

38:37.020 --> 38:39.020
UNBELIEVABLE.
OKAY, THANKS A LOT.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.270
LET'S GO!

38:41.610 --> 38:43.360
-THIS WAY.
-I CAME...

38:45.860 --> 38:48.410
WHOA, IS THIS POLICE TAPE?
WHOA, HEY, HEY,
ARE WE ALLOWED IN HERE?

38:48.450 --> 38:50.700
I DON'T KNOW IF
WE CAN COME IN. THE PLACE...
OH, DID YOU STEAL THOSE?

38:51.530 --> 38:52.910
I, UH, BORROWED THEM.

38:52.950 --> 38:54.120
&lt;CLICKING TONGUE&gt;

38:54.160 --> 38:55.870
THE LAST TIME I WAS
HERE WITH SABRINA,

38:55.910 --> 38:58.790
I COULD JUST SENSE THAT
SOMETHING WAS OFF.

38:58.830 --> 39:01.380
OF COURSE. YOU COULD SENSE
THAT SOMETHING WAS OFF.

39:01.420 --> 39:03.960
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
LIKE WE'RE JUST
OVERLOOKING SOMETHING.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.260
YES. I AGREE.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.550
FOR SOME REASON THIS PHOTO WAS
ALWAYS BOTHERING ME.

39:08.590 --> 39:09.590
AND IT'S NOT THE BLOOD.

39:11.600 --> 39:12.850
[JAKE] I THINK...

39:14.640 --> 39:16.350
-IT'S THE SCUFF MARK.
-THE SCUFF MARK.

39:22.310 --> 39:25.610
WAIT A MINUTE. THERE WAS
A DRESSER RIGHT THERE.

39:25.650 --> 39:26.900
RANDALL MUST HAVE SOLD IT.

39:26.940 --> 39:28.240
DES, GO MOVE THAT CHAIR.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.620
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

39:33.660 --> 39:36.790
WHOA. THE VENT, AND
THERE'S NO GRATE! BRILLIANT!

39:36.830 --> 39:40.580
DESSIE, I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO STICK
YOUR HAND IN THAT HOLE.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.470
&lt;INHALES&gt;

39:53.600 --> 39:55.640
HAS THE JURY
REACHED A VERDICT?

39:55.680 --> 39:59.440
WE HAVE FINALLY REACHED
A UNANIMOUS VERDICT, MY LORD.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.440
PASS IT ONTO THE BAILIFF
WHO WILL READ IT ALOUD.

40:02.480 --> 40:03.730
[JAKE] WHOA! HEY! OH!

40:03.770 --> 40:05.440
SORRY TO, UH, INTERRUPT.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.530
SORRY YOUR HONOR, YOUR LORD,
HONOR'S... LORD.

40:07.570 --> 40:09.150
FOR GOD'S SAKE!

40:09.200 --> 40:11.450
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO TALK WITH ME, IN PRIVATE.

40:11.490 --> 40:13.240
YOU THINK I'M GOING TO WHAT?

40:13.280 --> 40:17.410
WE HAVE WHAT YOU WOULD CALL,
UH, RELEVANT, NEW,
PERTINENT INFORMATION.

40:17.450 --> 40:20.250
GET OUT OF MY COURTROOM!
GET OUT, BOTH OF YOU!

40:20.290 --> 40:21.540
-I HAVE A GUN.
-&lt;JURY MURMURING&gt;

40:21.580 --> 40:24.540
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; DON'T WORRY.
DON'T SHOOT. IT'S A, UH...

40:24.590 --> 40:27.210
IT'S THE MURDER WEAPON THAT
KILLED TOM MCCARTHY.

40:27.550 --> 40:28.670
BUT GUESS WHAT.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.050
IT ONLY HAS ONE SET
OF PRINTS ON IT.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.510
AND THEY BELONG
TO THE DECEASED.

40:34.550 --> 40:35.720
[SABRINA] WHAT?

40:35.760 --> 40:37.100
WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

40:37.140 --> 40:39.680
TOM WAS THE ONLY PERSON
TO SHOOT THAT GUN.

40:39.730 --> 40:42.230
-HE COMMITTED SUICIDE?
-[JAKE] NO.

40:42.270 --> 40:44.190
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

40:44.230 --> 40:45.560
YOU SEE, YOU HONOR... LORD,

40:45.610 --> 40:50.490
APPARENTLY, TOM USED
TO LIKE TO SLEEP WITH
A GUN UNDER HIS PILLOW,

40:50.530 --> 40:52.860
AND THE NIGHT THAT
OWEN BROKE IN
AND SHOT HIM IN THE...

40:53.820 --> 40:57.080
ARSE, TOM WOKE UP WITH
A START, LIKE HE WOULD,

40:57.120 --> 40:59.950
-AND UH...
-ACCIDENTALLY SHOT HIMSELF.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.580
AND THEN WHEN YOU CAME
INTO THE ROOM,

41:02.670 --> 41:06.170
YOU ACCIDENTALLY
KICKED THE GUN INTO A VENT.

41:06.210 --> 41:07.550
AND THAT'S WHERE WE FOUND IT.

41:09.090 --> 41:11.880
SO THAT'S WHEN THEY'D SAY,
UH, "VOILA".

41:13.220 --> 41:14.340
THANK YOU.

41:15.680 --> 41:18.600
OH. THERE'S JUST
ONE MORE THING, YOUR HONOR.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.560
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP TOO
MUCH OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME,

41:20.600 --> 41:23.560
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
YOUR FOREMAN, LUKE, HERE,

41:23.600 --> 41:27.400
HE HAS SOME KIND OF
A COURT-TV DEAL.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.570
APPARENTLY THE DEAL GETS
EVEN SWEETER

41:29.610 --> 41:31.650
IF HE BRINGS HOME
A GUILTY VERDICT.

41:38.870 --> 41:39.950
INTERESTING.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.170
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

41:46.630 --> 41:48.750
-[MAL] WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

41:48.790 --> 41:50.920
IT WAS A GIFT FROM SABRINA
FOR HELPING HER.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.630
SHE, UH, NOW OFFICIALLY
OWNS THE BREWERY.

41:53.670 --> 41:54.880
IF THIS IS PAYMENT,

41:54.930 --> 41:56.720
THIS COULD BE THE BEST JOB
WE EVER TOOK.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.220
DON'T MIND IF I DO, SIR.

42:00.260 --> 42:04.850
YEAH, WHAT'S YOUR BEST PRICE
ON A...A LAST MINUTE,
UH, ONE-WAY FARE?

42:04.890 --> 42:07.350
YEAH, AND SO WHAT TIME...
THAT SUPER-SAVER ENDS...

42:08.610 --> 42:09.610
I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.

42:09.650 --> 42:11.150
PLANNING A LITTLE
TRIP THERE, SISTER?

42:11.820 --> 42:13.400
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; NO.

42:14.610 --> 42:17.820
A JOB OPPORTUNITY, ACTUALLY.

42:17.870 --> 42:19.950
JUST WEIGHING THE OPTIONS.
NO DECISION YET.

42:21.370 --> 42:22.750
IS IT OKAY IF TINNY...

42:22.790 --> 42:25.500
I MEAN...

42:25.540 --> 42:28.170
I SHOULD PROBABLY
FLY HER OUT WITH ME,
BUT, YOU KNOW, I...

42:28.210 --> 42:30.630
I DON'T KNOW IF
I'M GONNA BE STAYING, OR,

42:30.670 --> 42:32.670
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY
WHAT'S GONNA BE HAPPENING.

42:32.710 --> 42:34.260
NO, NO, NO, NO. ABSOLUTELY.

42:34.300 --> 42:36.180
BUT WE SHOULD SEE
WHAT SHE FEELS FIRST.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.720
YEAH. LET'S JUST, UH,
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.350
I THINK SHE'LL BE
SAFER WITH YOU.

42:40.390 --> 42:43.310
I MEAN HERE,
THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ANYWAY.

42:43.350 --> 42:46.770
-SO...
-SAFER FROM WHAT EXACTLY?

42:47.640 --> 42:49.730
NOTHING. SEE YOU LATER.

42:50.560 --> 42:51.770
-YEAH.
-BYE.

42:54.230 --> 42:55.690
KATHLEEN?

42:55.740 --> 42:57.570
-YEAH?
-DID YOU HAPPEN TO TELL YOUR

42:57.610 --> 42:59.780
NEW BOYFRIEND,
YOU KNOW, WALTER,

42:59.820 --> 43:01.200
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE
LEAVING MAYBE?

43:01.240 --> 43:03.080
OF COURSE.

43:03.120 --> 43:04.950
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH HIM ACTUALLY.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.540
SEE YOU LATER.

43:08.420 --> 43:09.830
-YEAH.
-BYE.

43:12.800 --> 43:13.840
AND YOU CALL ME FLIGHTY?

43:13.880 --> 43:16.470
AT LEAST SHE LEAVES ME ALONE
FOR LARGE STRETCHES OF TIME.

43:16.510 --> 43:19.010
GO AWAY WITH YOU.
IF I WAS GONE, YOU'D CRY
YOURSELF TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT.

43:19.050 --> 43:21.140
I WOULD SHED
MANY TEARS...OF JOY.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.770
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; NICE.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.770
UM, KATHLEEN AROUND?

43:26.810 --> 43:29.730
SHE HASN'T BEEN ANSWERING
ANY OF MY MESSAGES.
