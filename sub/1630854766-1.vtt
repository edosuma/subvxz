16:36.560 --> 16:38.040
Hey.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.128
Hey, pumpkin.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.524
You snored.

16:43.567 --> 16:44.742
Yeah, you too.

16:45.308 --> 16:48.398
[kissing]

16:50.661 --> 16:51.445
[knocking on door]

16:51.488 --> 16:52.489
Levi.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.580
Hey. Let's go eat.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.975
All right, give me a second.

17:01.498 --> 17:02.499
Yo, Riley!

17:03.370 --> 17:04.501
Let's go eat.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.677
[Riley] Go away.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.201
[Liv laughs]

17:08.244 --> 17:09.637
Mm-mm.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.683
["Run Rudolph Run"
by Chuck Berry]

17:15.686 --> 17:19.386
All right, so we got
root beer for Sadie,

17:19.429 --> 17:21.214
-Sprite for Livy.
-Thank you, baby.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.215
And Coke for Remy.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.086
-Thank you.
-No problem.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.132
You're gonna let me
order for you, right?

17:26.175 --> 17:27.437
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.309
You ever had a Coney?

17:29.352 --> 17:31.224
No. What is it?

17:31.267 --> 17:33.008
-She's never had a coney!
-[Liv laughs]

17:33.052 --> 17:35.532
It's like, uh, it's like
a hot dog, pretty much.

17:36.577 --> 17:37.360
Okay.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.102
You've had a hot dog, yeah?

17:42.104 --> 17:43.714
-No fucking way!
-[Liv laughs]

17:43.758 --> 17:46.761
Okay, uh, it's like a sausage.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.372
You're gonna like 'em.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.244
But my grandfather
once, in under an hour,

17:51.287 --> 17:52.636
ate 21 of them bad boys.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.290
-Oh, here we go.
-No, no, no. He did, he did.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.987
Yeah, he did, and they put his
plaque on the wall over there

17:56.031 --> 17:58.555
-Oh, really?
-Yes! He did. For years.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.339
[Liv] Oh, yeah?

17:59.382 --> 18:00.122
[Levi] Mm-hm.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.732
What happened to him?

18:01.776 --> 18:03.647
I mean, he died, like everybody.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.476
I'm sorry.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.521
It's okay.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.049
So how long have
you worn this getup?

18:15.790 --> 18:16.530
Since I was a girl.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.620
How long have you worked
at the truck stop?

18:20.795 --> 18:21.883
For a little while.

18:23.319 --> 18:26.540
[music continues]

18:27.889 --> 18:28.846
What?

18:30.718 --> 18:31.675
Nothing.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.721
Come on, say it. What is it?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.289
Just, how can you...

18:37.725 --> 18:39.509
how could you do that?

18:39.553 --> 18:41.903
-[Liv sighs]
-[Levi chuckles]

18:41.946 --> 18:43.818
I hate that question.

18:43.861 --> 18:44.862
I'm sorry, I don't--

18:44.906 --> 18:46.734
No, it's okay.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.257
I don't think too
much about it.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.433
It's just a way to make
some money for now.

18:52.696 --> 18:53.871
You?

18:53.915 --> 18:55.786
I mean, you don't
think I've worked a job

18:55.830 --> 18:56.961
for six bucks an hour?

18:58.224 --> 18:59.007
I've done that.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.707
Turn one trick, make a
whole day's pay, you know?

19:05.187 --> 19:07.146
It's kind of hard to
go back after that.

19:09.452 --> 19:10.714
I just like to party.

19:10.758 --> 19:11.976
[Liv laughs]

19:12.020 --> 19:13.239
-Slut.
-You know,

19:13.282 --> 19:15.328
you make a little dough.
It's not a bad gig.

19:15.371 --> 19:16.546
But you're gay.

19:16.590 --> 19:17.417
No.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.810
You know, I can blow the horn,

19:19.854 --> 19:22.509
but, well, I like ladies too.

19:23.945 --> 19:24.685
We're together.

19:25.773 --> 19:29.516
But it's, you know,
it's whatever.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.085
What about you, Remy?

19:34.129 --> 19:34.999
What do you wanna do?

19:39.787 --> 19:40.570
I don't know.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.356
Are you gonna go home?

19:45.096 --> 19:48.143
I can't go home.

19:48.187 --> 19:48.970
Why not?

19:50.798 --> 19:52.234
I just can't.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.062
Okay? I can't go back.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.984
So I got someone coming over.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.420
You're gonna have to
wait outside the room

20:04.464 --> 20:06.422
for a little bit, okay?

20:06.466 --> 20:07.249
Okay.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.255
You know, I can talk to Nora

20:13.299 --> 20:18.217
and probably get her to let
you stay another couple days

20:19.609 --> 20:21.524
while you figure out
what you wanna do.

20:23.047 --> 20:23.831
Thank you.

20:24.962 --> 20:25.702
All right.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.704
I'll make it quick.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.533

-[door squeaks]
-Hey.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.255
[Client] Hey, baby.

[couple chatters inside room]

21:00.955 --> 21:03.392
[door squeaks]

21:05.481 --> 21:08.136
[lighter flicks]

21:12.009 --> 21:13.141
Still here, huh?

21:17.580 --> 21:19.800
Why don't you
come wait inside.

21:19.843 --> 21:22.759
It's okay. I like it out here.

21:22.803 --> 21:23.630
Thank you, though.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.589
Oh, come on.

21:26.633 --> 21:29.244
They don't like you hanging
out out here anyway.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.854
Come on. I'll make some tea.

21:30.898 --> 21:34.205
[client in room moans]

21:40.777 --> 21:41.822
You're so pretty.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.999
People must say that
to you all the time.

21:47.218 --> 21:48.829
They don't?

21:48.872 --> 21:51.266
Well, then you are hanging
out with the wrong people.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.836
Sadie's a nice girl, huh?

21:57.838 --> 22:00.014
Yeah. She's really nice.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.059
They're all really good kids.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.278
And they take care of
each other, you know?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.801
'Cause it's rough out there.

22:06.716 --> 22:09.066
And it's nice to have
someone who has your back.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.941
But we have a rule.

22:13.984 --> 22:16.552
You stay, you work.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.380
But if you work, we
take care of you.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.954
Hey, don't be so nervous.

22:26.997 --> 22:27.868
I'm not gonna hurt you.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.306
So what do you think?

22:31.350 --> 22:32.916
You think you wanna stay
with us for a while?

22:36.659 --> 22:37.443
Good.

22:41.664 --> 22:42.491
Stand up for me.

22:43.797 --> 22:47.148
[ominous music]

22:47.191 --> 22:48.976
Look at you.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.156
Where do they even
get these dresses?

22:55.199 --> 22:57.071
Where is that store?

22:57.114 --> 22:58.942
I mean, is it like
a pioneer thing?

22:58.986 --> 23:00.422
It's so pervy.

23:00.466 --> 23:03.033
[ominous music]

23:10.824 --> 23:11.999
Don't be ashamed.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.308
You really are an angel.

23:23.053 --> 23:26.013
I have to ask, have you ever
even kissed someone before?

23:27.754 --> 23:28.407
No.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.161
Not so bad, huh?

23:45.119 --> 23:48.514
[ominous music]

23:48.557 --> 23:52.431
[Sadie] So, this whole
lot is exit 17.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.955
There's three stops
like ours on route 66,

23:54.998 --> 23:56.304
but if you're heading west,

23:56.347 --> 23:59.089
this is the last stop
for any quality action.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.613
If you wanna unbuckle
the bible belt,

24:00.656 --> 24:02.005
this is the place to do it.

24:02.049 --> 24:06.619
Good, clean, old-fashioned,
drug-free pussy.

24:06.662 --> 24:07.924
And dick.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.839
We have a bit of
a reputation here,

24:09.883 --> 24:10.753
and we're so proud of it.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.799
Hey, you know, Riley's mom,

24:12.842 --> 24:14.540
she worked exit 17.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.412
Gave it the nickname,
too. Candy Land.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.458
So there's four parts.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.982
The pit. Think of it
as a neighborhood.

24:22.025 --> 24:24.114
Yeah, you'd never just
walk up to any old house

24:24.158 --> 24:25.812
and knock on the door
at 3:00 AM and be like,

24:25.855 --> 24:28.249
"Hey, how's it going? You
want your cock sucked?"

24:28.292 --> 24:29.816
There's rules.

24:29.859 --> 24:32.035
If someone wants company,
they'll let you know.

24:33.428 --> 24:36.257
[Sadie] The first is simple,
back-in parking.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.043
Next is more of the same,

24:40.087 --> 24:41.262
if they flash their lights.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.308
Remember, they're
watching for you too.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.964
Next is the bathroom
cruisers. Levi?

24:48.008 --> 24:50.227
So your bathrooms are for
your thrill seekers, you know,

24:50.271 --> 24:53.230
not just about getting off,
but about not getting caught.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.015
Stalls around here
are most active

24:55.058 --> 24:56.799
in the afternoon
and the evening.

24:56.843 --> 25:00.150
I usually post up in the stall
at the end, against the wall.

25:00.194 --> 25:00.890
When someone comes in,

25:00.934 --> 25:02.370
[door squeaks open]

25:02.413 --> 25:04.154
you can tell a lot by
their body language.

25:04.198 --> 25:05.852
Do they go straight
to take a piss?

25:05.895 --> 25:07.418
[urine splashing]

25:07.462 --> 25:09.116
Do they bust through the
door and take a shit?

25:10.987 --> 25:11.945
[man farts]

25:11.988 --> 25:13.120
Or do they come in casually?

25:14.687 --> 25:17.385
And if they do, I
start to tap my foot.

25:17.428 --> 25:20.823
[boot tapping]

25:20.867 --> 25:24.784
If they tap back,
then it's game on.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.221
You know, and a lot of
these cats are not truckers.

25:27.264 --> 25:29.310
They're married men,
and proud of it too.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.051
They're just looking
for a little excitement.

25:32.182 --> 25:33.749
Who's that?

25:33.793 --> 25:36.317
That's Rex. Don't
worry about him.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.187
Not unless you're Levi.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.754
[Levi] Mm-hm.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.147
[Liv] Babe, the radio.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.017
Right. Go.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.845
So we use these.

25:42.889 --> 25:45.935
[static crackles]

25:45.979 --> 25:47.807
[Liv] We're listening
for our code words,

25:47.850 --> 25:48.634
[CB radio chatter]

25:48.677 --> 25:50.592
commercial company,

25:50.636 --> 25:54.291
angels on the
airwaves, lot lizards,

25:54.335 --> 25:58.208
or anyone who says they're
headed for Candy Land.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.167
[Trucker On CB] I-9,
this is Hot-Karl

26:00.210 --> 26:01.603
heading for Candy Land.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.213
Any lizards running today?

26:05.346 --> 26:06.390
33.

26:06.434 --> 26:07.827
So once they put
out the signal,

26:07.870 --> 26:10.133
we have 'em flip over
to a private channel,

26:10.177 --> 26:11.744
and there, we make plans.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.617
Hot-Karl, what did
you have in mind?

26:17.750 --> 26:22.537
[Sadie] And no matter what,
you always use one of these.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.714
They'll beg you not to, but
don't be stupid like Levi.

26:25.758 --> 26:28.064
Or for an extra 40
bucks, you can always

26:28.108 --> 26:29.109
-ride bare back.
-Stop.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.198
-Do not listen to him.
-It's...

26:31.241 --> 26:32.852
So what do you
think? You ready?

26:34.114 --> 26:34.984
Wait, now?

26:35.028 --> 26:36.333
[chuckles] No, I'm kidding.

26:36.377 --> 26:38.248
Relax, we're not
gonna start you here.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.038
So, this is your room.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.867
Liv was nice enough
to move in with Sadie

26:47.910 --> 26:49.956
so that you could
have it for yourself.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.873
Do whatever you want with
it. Make it your own.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.527
And I got you something.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.054
Why don't you try it on.

27:01.097 --> 27:03.317
We'll let you get settled.

27:24.555 --> 27:27.384

[ominous music]

28:23.527 --> 28:25.529
[knocking on door]

28:28.968 --> 28:31.013
Wow. You look
like a real woman.

28:41.197 --> 28:41.981
How do you feel?

28:43.243 --> 28:44.810
[Remy] I feel okay.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.376
[Nora] Great. I'm so
glad to hear it.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.510
We have a guy
coming to see you.

28:49.553 --> 28:50.772
He's a really nice man.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.209
He's super gentle.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.863
We don't let guys
in here who aren't,

28:54.907 --> 28:56.473
you know, people we trust.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.044
It is okay to be a
little nervous and shy.

29:02.088 --> 29:03.524
That's fine. It's normal.

29:05.526 --> 29:09.704
But I know that
deep down inside,

29:09.748 --> 29:12.489
there's a woman who
is dying to come out.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.361
So don't be afraid
