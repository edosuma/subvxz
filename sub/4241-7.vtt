00:00.100 --> 00:01.552
<i>Here's what you missed on Glee.</i>
BRAZIL

00:01.553 --> 00:03.981
<i>Will's wife put the "Terri"
in "terrible relationship,"</i>

00:03.982 --> 00:06.065
<i>- so now she's his ex-wife.</i>
- What is wrong with you?

00:06.066 --> 00:07.599
<i>Kurt met this kid Blaine
who he really likes</i>

00:07.667 --> 00:09.584
<i>and he seems really nice,
but he sings in the Glee Club</i>

00:09.585 --> 00:11.290
<i>at another school.
They're called The Warblers.</i>

00:11.291 --> 00:13.071
The Warblers are like rock stars.

00:13.139 --> 00:14.873
<i>Kurt isn't liking his
own school at all, because</i>

00:14.941 --> 00:16.475
<i>Karofsky's been coming after him,
and nobody knows why.</i>

00:16.542 --> 00:17.943
You can't punch the gay out of me

00:18.011 --> 00:19.411
any more than I can punch
the ignoramus out of you.

00:19.479 --> 00:21.191
<i>Well, Kurt knows why,
but he hasn't told anyone.</i>

00:21.192 --> 00:22.886
<i>And that's what you missed on...
Glee!</i>

00:30.664 --> 00:31.252
Morning, Sue.

00:31.253 --> 00:32.834
Oh, I'm gonna stop you right there.

00:33.326 --> 00:34.326
That's Principal Sue.

00:34.828 --> 00:35.424
What?

00:35.425 --> 00:36.728
Oh, you heard me right.

00:36.796 --> 00:40.825
My years-long quest for power
has finally bore fruit.

00:40.893 --> 00:41.926
Wait, what happened to Figgins?

00:41.994 --> 00:44.163
Well, you need to start
listening to the news, William.

00:44.263 --> 00:46.330
A particularly virulent
strain of monkey flu

00:46.398 --> 00:49.247
has arrived in Ohio from Borneo,
where it had been festering

00:49.248 --> 00:52.503
in a small clutch of loud,
bisexual primates,

00:52.571 --> 00:54.920
not unlike your very Glee Club.

00:55.106 --> 00:57.875
How...
How did Figgins get it?

00:57.943 --> 01:00.011
And that's what it
means to be an American.

01:00.078 --> 01:01.913
- I think I have a fever.
- Can it.

01:03.348 --> 01:04.682
Now.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.562 --> 01:18.644
'Sup?

01:19.949 --> 01:21.368
So Figgins is sick.

01:21.369 --> 01:22.969
How does that make you principal?

01:22.970 --> 01:25.436
Well, through the blackmail
of prominent local politicians,

01:25.504 --> 01:28.873
I strong-armed some extraordinarily broad
clauses into my contract.

01:28.941 --> 01:30.374
My first order of business?

01:30.442 --> 01:32.143
Destroy the Glee Club.

01:32.210 --> 01:33.744
I... I thought we were friends.

01:33.812 --> 01:35.513
That got boring.

01:48.393 --> 01:50.728
<i>Just one of the perks of
being a high school teacher:</i>

01:50.796 --> 01:53.030
<i>Constant exposure to illness.</i>

01:53.098 --> 01:54.799
All right, guys, um...

01:55.723 --> 01:58.102
Time to start thinking
about song selections.

01:58.170 --> 02:00.237
<i>I mean, I feel like I might have a fever,</i>

02:00.305 --> 02:01.539
<i>but it's important
that I power through it.</i>

02:07.546 --> 02:10.648
<i>Okay.
I definitely have a fever.</i>

02:10.716 --> 02:12.483
Lookin' good, Puckerman.

02:12.551 --> 02:15.052
Someone's been eating their wheaties.

02:15.551 --> 02:17.507
These guns are fully loaded.

02:18.171 --> 02:20.242
Mr. Shue?
I, for one,

02:20.243 --> 02:22.927
think we should use our
set list for sectionals

02:22.995 --> 02:26.397
to start exploring the oeuvre
of one Bernadette Peters.

02:26.465 --> 02:30.368
Someday, I'm gonna go to
Paris and visit the oeuvre.

02:30.435 --> 02:31.969
I just want to dance.

02:32.037 --> 02:34.772
Mr. Schuester,
you look a little green.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.608
Um...
I think I'm gonna go see the nurse.

02:39.611 --> 02:42.446
But first I feel like I
should get you guys a sitter.

02:42.514 --> 02:46.017
<i>At this point, it would be a good idea
to add any of your aromatics, like...</i>

02:54.713 --> 02:57.146
<i>We're going to cover the pan
until the clams open up...</i>

02:57.462 --> 02:58.929
I can take care of myself.

02:58.997 --> 03:00.898
Is that why Mrs. Weiss
called me from next door?

03:00.966 --> 03:03.886
Because, according to her,
she's here morning and night.

03:03.887 --> 03:04.664
Lift your head up.

03:04.841 --> 03:06.704
You're making me feel worse.

03:06.772 --> 03:08.072
Oh, honey.

03:11.376 --> 03:12.710
I'm probably revealing too much,

03:12.778 --> 03:14.045
but I do still love you.

03:14.731 --> 03:16.622
And you have to admit,
no matter how toxic

03:16.623 --> 03:18.817
our marriage was,
I was really good

03:18.818 --> 03:20.284
at taking care of you when you were sick.

03:20.352 --> 03:22.553
That's because you like
me best when I'm weak.

03:22.621 --> 03:23.788
Maybe.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.723
I mean,
that's what my therapist says.

03:25.791 --> 03:27.191
You're seeing a therapist?

03:27.259 --> 03:28.692
And I'm medicating, too.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.896
Now roll over,
and pull your pants down,

03:31.963 --> 03:34.574
- because we're gonna take baby's temperature.
- No.

03:35.270 --> 03:38.602
But baby knows it's the only way
that we can get an accurate reading.

03:38.670 --> 03:41.739
Stop, Terri.

03:41.807 --> 03:43.674
I don't want to play sick baby with you.

03:43.742 --> 03:45.910
Now, get out of here.

03:51.316 --> 03:52.650
What are you doing?

03:54.419 --> 03:55.820
<i>Singin' in the Rain</i>.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.955
We were together sixteen years.
You think I don't remember

03:58.023 --> 04:00.324
what movie makes you feel
better when you're sick?

04:00.392 --> 04:02.026
<i>Then they're not good,
so don't eat those.</i>

04:02.094 --> 04:03.094
<i>Just go ahead and discard those.</i>

04:03.161 --> 04:05.996
<i>And that is how you steam clams.</i>

04:08.700 --> 04:09.796
I'm shaking.

04:09.797 --> 04:11.635
And it's either from
low blood sugar or rage.

04:11.703 --> 04:13.003
I knew it was only a matter of time

04:13.071 --> 04:15.172
before Rachel tried to
take over the Glee Club.

04:17.971 --> 04:21.612
Class, in Mr. Schuester's absence,
I'd like to go around and ask everyone

04:21.680 --> 04:24.502
what solos they'd like to
hear me perform at sectionals.

04:24.503 --> 04:25.950
All right, you know what?
Let me at her!

04:28.053 --> 04:29.954
We'll forget all about
it tonight at bowling.

04:30.021 --> 04:30.988
I can't.

04:31.056 --> 04:32.690
Blaine asked me to hang out.

04:33.330 --> 04:35.170
I've been looking forward to it all week.

04:36.094 --> 04:37.728
Wait.
Are you two going out?

04:37.796 --> 04:39.330
Because I think you need to come clean.

04:39.397 --> 04:40.731
What? No.

04:40.799 --> 04:43.513
I don't want another
Jessie/Rachel traitor scenario to overcome.

04:43.869 --> 04:45.069
Please, Mercedes. Mum's the word.

04:45.137 --> 04:46.637
We'd be happy for you.

04:46.705 --> 04:48.572
I mean,
we know how lonely you've been.

04:48.640 --> 04:49.840
All right, we just hang out.

04:49.908 --> 04:51.575
Nothing about Glee Club
even ever comes up.

04:51.643 --> 04:53.844
It's just nice to have someone to talk to.

04:53.912 --> 04:57.381
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I mean, someone like me.

04:58.301 --> 04:59.653
But I promise to make it up to you.

04:59.654 --> 05:00.768
We'll hang out Friday night.

05:10.929 --> 05:12.763
Excuse you.

05:15.901 --> 05:17.001
Whoa, whoa.
A couple more.

05:17.068 --> 05:18.302
Thanks.

05:18.905 --> 05:22.139
So what are we going to do about
Glee Club while Mr. Shue is sick?

05:22.207 --> 05:23.474
I have an idea.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.309
Have you met the new Spanish teacher?

05:27.243 --> 05:29.480
<i>It's not easy being a substitute teacher.</i>

05:29.548 --> 05:31.248
<i>Kids feel like they get the day off.</i>

05:31.316 --> 05:34.084
<i>They'll goof off, egg your car, cut class,</i>

05:34.152 --> 05:35.786
<i>break into your car, throw spitballs,</i>

05:35.854 --> 05:37.555
<i>put an alligator in your car...</i>

05:37.622 --> 05:39.286
<i>And I don't even have a nice car.</i>

05:44.391 --> 05:46.541
<i>So I try to relate to the kids,</i>

05:46.542 --> 05:49.034
<i>listen to what they have to say,
make it fun for them.</i>

05:52.707 --> 05:55.139
<i>Lindsay Lohan es bien loca, ¿no?</i>

05:55.140 --> 05:57.813
<i>Because I'm the cure for the common class.</i>

06:08.453 --> 06:10.387
Excuse me, Miss Holliday?
A word?

06:21.640 --> 06:24.662
I understand that you are subbing
for Mr. Schuester's Spanish class,

06:24.663 --> 06:27.076
and I was wondering if you
might not want to take over

06:27.077 --> 06:28.488
his Glee Club duties, as well.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.908
What makes you think I know
the first thing about Glee Club?

06:30.976 --> 06:33.177
You subbed for my English class last week.

06:33.245 --> 06:34.912
And you were extraordinary.

Homeless.

07:05.205 --> 07:07.244
Miss Holliday, we are floundering.

07:07.312 --> 07:08.445
Won't you please take over Glee Club?

07:08.513 --> 07:10.648
I thought you'd never ask.

07:10.715 --> 07:12.216
Yay!

07:12.284 --> 07:13.717
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

07:17.478 --> 07:18.702
Dude, what are you doing?

07:18.703 --> 07:21.027
Kurt got us a substitute,
so I'm buttering the floor.

07:21.028 --> 07:22.760
But sectionals is, like,
two weeks from now.

07:22.827 --> 07:25.496
Hey, Gigantor.
We're all gonna swap names, yo.

07:25.563 --> 07:28.265
Um, did I hear something
about a substitute?

07:28.333 --> 07:29.633
Yes! It works!

07:31.269 --> 07:34.271
Well, at least I didn't
fall and break my talent.

07:34.339 --> 07:36.273
I'm fine.

07:41.313 --> 07:42.646
Oh, what the hell?

07:42.714 --> 07:44.448
<i>Hola, clase.</i>

07:44.516 --> 07:47.785
Nothing says "<i>bienvenidos</i>"
quite like a buttered floor.

07:49.354 --> 07:50.888
Let's start with some introductions.

07:50.955 --> 07:53.290
My name is Holly Holliday.

07:53.358 --> 07:55.025
What's yours?
Go.

07:55.093 --> 07:57.661
I'm Finn Hudson.
I'm quarterback of the football team.

07:57.729 --> 08:00.130
I'm Rachel Berry,
his loud, loud girlfriend.

08:00.198 --> 08:02.733
I'm Mike Chang.

08:02.801 --> 08:03.761
Those aren't your names.

08:03.762 --> 08:05.402
- You know why I know that?
- You're psychic?

08:05.470 --> 08:07.205
I know this because I recently watched

08:07.206 --> 08:09.640
a video of you guys
performing at regionals,

08:09.708 --> 08:11.542
where you came in last.

08:11.609 --> 08:14.311
Maybe it's because the songs
were about thirty years old, but...

08:14.379 --> 08:15.346
Those songs are classics.

08:15.413 --> 08:16.947
Those songs are amazing.

08:17.015 --> 08:20.926
But they sounded like somebody
else's favorite songs. Not yours.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.860
- Just sayin'.
- She speaks the truth.

08:22.861 --> 08:25.789
I'm not your average,
run-of-the-mill substitute teacher.

08:25.857 --> 08:29.907
I want you guys to do things
that you want to do.

08:29.908 --> 08:34.136
I want you to have fun in our fabulous
but fleeting time together.

08:34.332 --> 08:35.466
What do you say we have
class outside today?

08:35.533 --> 08:37.167
It's raining outside.

08:37.235 --> 08:38.802
Well, then let's take a
field trip to Taco Bell.

08:38.870 --> 08:40.404
Oh, yeah!

08:40.472 --> 08:43.214
Should we toke up some
medical-grade marijuana?

08:43.215 --> 08:44.694
I wish.

08:44.695 --> 08:45.698
Yes!

08:45.699 --> 08:47.704
- It's really hard not to like this woman.
- Okay...

08:47.705 --> 08:50.080
No.
We can't just goof off all day.

08:50.148 --> 08:52.316
We have to write a set
list for sectionals.

08:52.384 --> 08:54.837
You're right.
What songs would you like to do?

08:56.921 --> 08:59.935
Oh. Don't get asked that
question much, do we?

08:59.936 --> 09:01.601
Ms. Holliday is right.

09:01.602 --> 09:03.214
Mr. Schuester's set
list sometimes seems like

09:03.215 --> 09:04.668
he hasn't listened to
the radio since the '80s.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.788
He never listens to what I have to say.

09:06.931 --> 09:09.867
Mr. Shue, can we do that new
Cee-Lo song, "Forget You"?

09:09.934 --> 09:11.902
Uh, no.
Come on, guys,

09:11.970 --> 09:14.171
there's got to be a Journey
song we haven't done yet.

09:14.851 --> 09:15.883
Cee-Lo!

09:15.884 --> 09:17.449
That's what I'm talking about.

09:18.877 --> 09:21.574
Okay, excuse me?
What would you know about Cee-Lo?

09:21.575 --> 09:22.791

12:11.590 --> 12:12.935

12:12.936 --> 12:15.269
Principal Sue,
and I'm here to inform you

12:15.270 --> 12:17.300
that effective 4:00 P.M. today...

12:18.157 --> 12:21.479
The football team is
officially... disbanded.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.353
Well, if you're cutting the football team,

12:23.354 --> 12:25.554
who are your Cheerios! going to cheer for?

12:30.193 --> 12:33.762
I will get back to you

Yes, Coach?

13:15.347 --> 13:16.831
Becky, take a memo.

13:17.574 --> 13:21.277
- I'm banning po-tater tots.
- Outstanding.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.449
Mr. Shue, I'm so glad you're better.

the authority to take over Glee Club.

- What?
- I was doing a fine job of
running Glee in your absence,

16:17.878 --> 16:20.456
and then Kurt, jealous,
asked her to take over.

16:20.523 --> 16:22.725
I'm not too worried about it, Rachel.

16:25.261 --> 16:27.318
I really appreciate your concern, but...

16:28.576 --> 16:30.966
I'm not worried about someone
coming in and usurping me.

16:31.034 --> 16:32.668
You kids love me.

16:32.736 --> 16:34.503
Sue doesn't.

16:35.681 --> 16:37.800
is having someone fun at this school.

Mm. We're back. Okay.

16:41.052 --> 16:43.127

16:52.010 --> 16:53.529
You have to get well, Mr. Schuester,

16:53.530 --> 16:55.872
because every day
you're here, she's there,

16:55.873 --> 16:57.121
and it becomes more and more likely

16:57.122 --> 16:58.594
that she's going to start
running the Glee Club,

16:58.595 --> 17:00.548
and you're going to become the substitute.

17:09.539 --> 17:11.507
Oh, we have to get there early on Friday.

17:11.508 --> 17:12.641
It's league night for little people,

17:12.709 --> 17:14.742
and they'll buy up all the small
shoes if they get there first.

17:14.810 --> 17:15.922
Oh, I totally forgot.

17:15.923 --> 17:18.280
Greg Evigan is starring in
rent at the community playhouse,

17:18.281 --> 17:19.662
and Blaine got us tickets.

17:20.222 --> 17:22.003
"Us" as in all of us?

17:22.434 --> 17:24.252
I think he could only score two.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.978
Wait. Where do you think
you're going with those?

17:33.979 --> 17:35.356
Principal Sue banned the tots.

17:35.660 --> 17:37.027
She can't do that!

17:37.028 --> 17:38.814
They look like deep-fried deer poop.

17:38.815 --> 17:40.076
Take it up with principal Sue.

17:43.879 --> 17:44.682
We'll get you some-some...

17:44.683 --> 17:45.872
Ugh! Okay.

17:48.418 --> 17:49.681
Why did you take away our tots?

17:49.682 --> 17:51.285
You don't have an appointment.

17:53.081 --> 17:54.146
Jackee,

17:54.147 --> 17:57.443
I am like my idol,
Richard Millhouse Nixon.

17:57.526 --> 18:00.422
Regarded in his time as
petty, corrupt and venal,

18:00.490 --> 18:03.992
he actually always had the best
interests of his people in mind.

18:04.060 --> 18:06.762
And also like Richard Nixon,
I'm obliged to inform you

18:06.830 --> 18:08.597
that this conversation is being recorded.

18:08.665 --> 18:10.666
I want my tots.

18:10.733 --> 18:13.469
Nutrition is abysmal at this school.

18:14.002 --> 18:14.880
You know what this is?

18:14.881 --> 18:16.641
Toilet brush. It's broccoli.

18:16.642 --> 18:19.033
When I showed this to Brittany
earlier, she began to whimper,

18:19.034 --> 18:22.704
thinking I had cut down a small tree
where a family of gummy bears lived.

18:23.016 --> 18:25.447
I am declaring a war on junk food.

18:25.515 --> 18:27.683
I'm getting my tots back.

18:29.552 --> 18:31.220
Becky, that can't happen again.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.248
Keep 'em out.

18:33.249 --> 18:34.944
Roger that. Thank you, coach.

18:37.677 --> 18:39.799
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hello, miss Holliday.

18:39.800 --> 18:40.508
I'd like you to know

18:40.509 --> 18:42.531
that I have a very severe
bruise on my right buttocks

18:42.532 --> 18:44.741
from your game of gangsta
rap musical chairs.

18:44.742 --> 18:47.388
I'll be going on record with
the school nurse later today.

18:47.389 --> 18:49.663
Rachel, you suck.

18:49.779 --> 18:52.495
Oh, my God, you're like a total drag.

18:52.496 --> 18:54.546
Has anyone ever told you that? I have.

18:54.547 --> 18:55.944
Oh, Puckerman, here are the answers

18:55.945 --> 18:58.000
to the pop quiz I'll be
giving in Spanish class later.

18:58.001 --> 18:59.856
It is so boring in there.

18:59.857 --> 19:00.484
Thanks, miss h.

19:00.485 --> 19:01.560
Righteous.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.629
You know what? Maybe I
should be more like you.

19:05.630 --> 19:08.123
All fun, and just forget
about the consequences.

19:08.124 --> 19:09.562
Well, frankly, yes, you should.

19:09.563 --> 19:10.791
I mean, at least sometimes.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.456
When was the last time
that you did something

19:12.457 --> 19:14.457
just because you thought
it would be a blast?

19:14.838 --> 19:16.126
Take Glee Club.

19:16.550 --> 19:18.537
I mean, you have all these great ideas.

19:18.538 --> 19:20.562
When is the last time you
actually did one of them?

19:20.563 --> 19:23.504
Mr. Shue can be a little
tight-fisted with song selection, but

19:23.505 --> 19:25.894
I would like to do something
a little bit more upbeat

19:25.895 --> 19:27.977
and glamorous with a good dance beat.

19:27.978 --> 19:30.582
Sounds reasonable to me. Have you asked?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.273
Mr. Shuster, I want to
do more of an upbeat,

19:33.274 --> 19:35.472
glamorous song with a
really good dance beat.

19:35.473 --> 19:37.745
No, but I have good news.

19:37.903 --> 19:40.051
I found a journey song
we haven't done yet.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.420
Rachel, I used to be just like you,

19:42.421 --> 19:45.212
trying to get everything so
right, hanging on so tight.

19:45.338 --> 19:46.266
What happened?

19:46.359 --> 19:48.671
I got punched in the face. Anyway,

19:48.672 --> 19:49.899
why don't you let me know the name

19:49.900 --> 19:52.603
of this upbeat, glamorous
song with the nice dance beat,

19:52.604 --> 19:56.057
because, hot stuff, you
are doing it in Glee Club.

19:56.058 --> 19:58.824
I kind of need a partner
to do the song I wanted.

19:58.825 --> 20:00.723
I thought you'd never ask.

20:00.892 --> 20:02.419
That's kind of my catch phrase.

20:04.428 --> 20:05.631
So...

20:06.064 --> 20:07.300
What meds are you on?

20:07.778 --> 20:12.059
Um, antidepressants and
anti-anxiety when I need them.

20:15.585 --> 20:16.671
Are you happy?

20:17.219 --> 20:18.608
You know, I think I feel like

20:18.609 --> 20:20.554
for the first time maybe I could be happy.

20:21.746 --> 20:22.948
How about you?

20:23.824 --> 20:24.947
Happy? Yeah.

20:27.001 --> 20:28.278
If I'm gonna be honest,

20:28.742 --> 20:29.944
no.

20:31.068 --> 20:33.589
I still feel like I'm
searching for something.

20:33.590 --> 20:35.744
Here. Some more.

20:37.054 --> 20:38.058
There...

20:38.059 --> 20:39.394
Thanks, Terri.

20:41.294 --> 20:42.660
Baby likes his soup.

20:42.661 --> 20:43.861
Oh.

20:43.929 --> 20:46.347
You know, I remember something
else that baby loves a lot.

20:51.402 --> 20:52.368
Okay.

20:57.640 --> 20:58.899
Rubbing menthol.

21:00.247 --> 21:02.449
I love that stuff. I know you do.

21:02.450 --> 21:04.972
Take your shirt off, lie
on your stomach. Come on.

21:06.363 --> 21:07.649
What? I'm not going to kill you.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.817
It'll make you feel better. All right.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.708
Here.

21:34.705 --> 21:35.843
Don't.

21:36.136 --> 21:37.230
Don't.

21:37.592 --> 21:39.012
I don't want to get you sick.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.972
I don't care.

21:55.202 --> 21:56.693
Look at this crap.

21:56.694 --> 21:57.971
Foam fish sticks?

21:58.146 --> 22:00.848
Principal Sylvester's only
serving predigested food now

22:00.915 --> 22:02.282
to give us more energy.

22:02.350 --> 22:04.051
I mean, do I look like a damn baby bird?

22:04.119 --> 22:05.886
Don't fret your culinary disappointments.

22:05.954 --> 22:07.121
I come bearing gifts.

22:07.188 --> 22:08.288
You brought tots?

22:08.356 --> 22:09.823
Better. I've set you up on a date.

22:09.891 --> 22:11.391
I get it.

22:11.459 --> 22:12.626
My new budding friendship with Blaine

22:12.694 --> 22:14.027
is making you feel left out,

22:14.095 --> 22:15.662
jealous. Who's the guy?

22:15.730 --> 22:17.390
Anthony Rashad.

22:20.769 --> 22:22.503
Why him?

22:22.570 --> 22:24.004
No reason.

22:24.072 --> 22:25.844
Oh, so it has nothing to do
with the fact that he's one of

22:25.944 --> 22:27.714
the five black guys at this school?

22:28.267 --> 22:30.817
Uh, no, he is a wide
receiver on the football team,

22:30.917 --> 22:33.013
he is very good-looking,

22:33.081 --> 22:35.616
and he is a member of
the black student union.

22:35.683 --> 22:37.017
Any non-black activities?

22:37.085 --> 22:39.820
I don't know...
My Google search was a little...

22:39.888 --> 22:40.854
I can't take this anymore.

22:40.922 --> 22:42.890
Mercedes, trust me, love is just

22:42.957 --> 22:45.659
around the corner. What's up, homo?

22:45.727 --> 22:47.895
That's not what I'm talking about.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.271
Tots!

22:57.338 --> 22:58.572
Oh, my God!

22:58.640 --> 23:00.507
Tots! Tots! Tots!

23:00.575 --> 23:02.042
Tots! Tots! Tots!

23:02.110 --> 23:03.610
Tots! Tots!

23:03.678 --> 23:06.680
Tots! Tots! Tots! Tots! Tots! Tots!

23:06.748 --> 23:09.416
So the tot wars have begun, Becky.

Hey, buddy,

25:36.698 --> 25:38.332
You look terrible...
You should be home in bed.

25:38.399 --> 25:39.866
There's no reason for you to be here.

25:39.934 --> 25:41.635
Well, the kids need me.

25:41.703 --> 25:44.171
No, literally, there's no
reason for you to be here.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.974
The kids prefer the
substitute, and so do I.

25:47.041 --> 25:48.542
I got to be honest with you, Will.

25:48.609 --> 25:50.477
A lot of it's the hair thing.

25:50.545 --> 25:53.146
In fact, right now I'm
tempted to sell your scalp

25:53.214 --> 25:56.183
on the black market as a tiny,
full-length shearling coat

25:56.250 --> 25:59.353
for only the most fashionable
of premature babies.

25:59.420 --> 26:03.390
Oh... I long for the day when Figgins
gets better and comes back.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.158
Well, that's not gonna happen.

26:05.226 --> 26:06.793
The school board has been just flooded

26:06.861 --> 26:09.963
with e-mails from parents
thrilled with my tough stance

26:10.031 --> 26:11.565
on healthy teen lunches.

26:11.632 --> 26:13.300
Figgins has been fired,

26:13.368 --> 26:15.635
and I've been formally
offered the position.

26:15.703 --> 26:17.404
So, why don't you go home,

26:17.472 --> 26:20.640
rest, watch some tv, die.

26:20.708 --> 26:23.010
It doesn't matter...
'Cause you know what?

26:23.077 --> 26:26.480
As my first official act
as full-time principal,

26:26.547 --> 26:28.048
you are fired.

26:35.959 --> 26:37.365
Drunk people who get married
to someone just saying that

26:37.366 --> 26:39.312
they met an hour ago by
an Elvis impersonator...

26:39.313 --> 26:40.714
I mean, that's the
bigger insult to marriage

26:40.715 --> 26:42.587
than two gay guys getting
hitched. Totally. It's, like,

26:42.588 --> 26:45.426
if marriage is so sacred, they
should just outlaw divorce.

26:45.427 --> 26:46.643
Right? Right. Right.

26:46.772 --> 26:47.721
What do you think, Mercedes?

26:47.722 --> 26:49.416
Oh, about, uh, "don't ask, don't tell".

26:49.417 --> 26:51.045
No, we're on prop 8 now.

26:51.244 --> 26:52.911
Totally for it.

26:52.979 --> 26:53.912
Against it.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.213
Right.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.578
I'm sorry, I kind of just blanked out.

26:56.579 --> 26:58.180
Oh, don't apologize...
We should talk about stuff

26:58.181 --> 26:59.751
that you're interested in, too.

26:59.819 --> 27:00.554
I know...
Let's play a game.

27:00.555 --> 27:01.606
Okay, on the count of three,

27:01.607 --> 27:03.788
name your favorite 2010 vogue cover.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.458
Okay, ready?
One, two, three...

27:06.526 --> 27:08.560
Marion Cotillard. Yes!
Marion Cotillard. Oh, my God, stop it!

27:08.628 --> 27:09.928
Yes, I know. She's amazing!

27:09.996 --> 27:11.396
Amazing! Amazing!

27:11.464 --> 27:13.198
Amazing.
Gay!

27:13.266 --> 27:14.833
Gay! Gay. Gay, gay, gay.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.668
Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.

27:16.736 --> 27:19.738
Oh, my gosh, I open my mouth
and a little purse falls out!

27:19.805 --> 27:20.605
That's so gay.

27:20.673 --> 27:21.973
How did that get in there?

27:22.041 --> 27:22.941
Mercedes?

27:24.571 --> 27:26.684
Mercedes?
I was just talking

27:26.685 --> 27:29.307
about the Buckeyes...
I'm a college football fan.

27:29.308 --> 27:30.326
I like sports, too, you know.

27:30.579 --> 27:32.447
Oh, way to break the stereotype.

27:32.515 --> 27:35.270
Excuse me. I know it's not on your menu,

27:35.271 --> 27:36.685
but I was wondering if you guys had...

27:36.752 --> 27:38.086
You want some tots?

27:38.154 --> 27:40.121
You kids must go to McKinley.

27:41.324 --> 27:44.526
So, what were we talking about?

27:44.593 --> 27:47.285
Has anyone read Patti Lupone's new book?

27:50.168 --> 27:53.554
I'm kidding. Of course
I have. You scared me

27:53.654 --> 27:54.226
so much there.

27:54.227 --> 27:55.205
I know, I was...

27:56.708 --> 27:58.175
Nice job, band dudes.

27:58.243 --> 28:01.044
It feels like the sun is shining in here.

28:01.112 --> 28:02.713
And the body's still warm.

28:02.780 --> 28:05.115
Hi. I'm Will Schuester,

28:05.183 --> 28:07.484
and this is my choir room.

28:07.552 --> 28:09.453
I'm sorry we had to meet like this.

28:09.520 --> 28:12.437
The kids really love you.
You must be a great teacher.

28:12.537 --> 28:14.409
You don't believe that...
If you did,

28:14.410 --> 28:15.994
you wouldn't have taken my job so easily.

28:16.018 --> 28:17.586
Guys, you want to take five?

28:19.355 --> 28:21.490
Okay, you want to have this
conversation, let's have it.

28:21.557 --> 28:23.825
You're a substitute...
Of course you can...

28:23.893 --> 28:26.261
Paint murals and let the
kids sing whatever they want.

28:26.329 --> 28:28.130
You're never around when they have to deal

28:28.197 --> 28:29.698
with the hangover of all that fun.

28:29.766 --> 28:32.868
16% of all high school
students dropped out last year.

28:32.935 --> 28:35.670
We can't just expect them
to sit up and pay attention.

28:35.738 --> 28:37.139
These kids feel special.

28:37.206 --> 28:39.908
They have a voice, and
if we don't listen to it,

28:39.976 --> 28:41.309
they just tune us out.

28:41.377 --> 28:43.078
I give my kids a voice.

28:43.146 --> 28:44.913
I just don't let it run free.

28:44.981 --> 28:46.882
I'm the teacher...
It's my job to know

28:46.949 --> 28:49.351
more than they do. Right,
but you don't know more

28:49.419 --> 28:51.753
about what they care about
the most... Themselves.

28:51.821 --> 28:53.388
These kids get bored,

28:53.456 --> 28:55.023
they change their Facebook status.

28:55.091 --> 28:57.511
They're entitled to have
all of these emotions,

28:57.512 --> 28:58.493
and not only that, they're entitled

28:58.561 --> 29:00.228
for the world to care about them.

29:00.296 --> 29:01.763
That's what this generation is about.

29:01.831 --> 29:04.032
A great teacher is
supposed to show them that

29:04.100 --> 29:05.901
there are other points
of view besides their own.

29:05.968 --> 29:07.602
Okay, fine. What do you do when

29:07.670 --> 29:09.938
a kid does something
really great in your class?

29:10.006 --> 29:12.974
Praise them. I tweet them
about it right there and then,

29:13.042 --> 29:15.798
and for those 30 seconds, I know
that that kid has a connection

29:15.799 --> 29:17.219
with me.

29:20.983 --> 29:23.840
Look, it's... a terrible economy,

29:23.841 --> 29:26.494
and good teaching jobs
are hard enough to get,

29:26.495 --> 29:27.923
let alone one in the arts.

29:27.990 --> 29:29.658
I just...

29:29.725 --> 29:33.762
I'm sorry, but I... I can't
turn this opportunity down.

29:44.006 --> 29:47.075
You want to tell Ms.
Holliday why we're here?

29:47.143 --> 29:49.778
Remember when I asked
to be excused from class?

29:49.846 --> 29:51.813
May I be excused? I'm
gonna go shove some tots

29:51.881 --> 29:53.215
up the tailpipe of coach Sylvester's car.

29:53.282 --> 29:55.250
Sure!

29:55.318 --> 29:57.953
I told her not to touch my tots.

29:58.020 --> 30:01.517
You did $17,000 worth of damage.

30:02.461 --> 30:05.794
I drive a very rare and
desirable automobile, ladies.

30:05.862 --> 30:08.396
Prized by collectors
for its peerless grace

30:08.464 --> 30:10.765
among vintage European sports cars,

30:10.833 --> 30:13.201
one out of seven in existence.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.403
The 1979 Lecar.

30:15.471 --> 30:16.872
You know how many hours it took

30:16.939 --> 30:19.307
to find a mechanic who
even knew what a Lecar was?

30:19.375 --> 30:20.775
She's your student.

30:20.843 --> 30:23.178
I would love to hear what
you suggest as punishment.

30:23.246 --> 30:26.381
I was gonna suggest clapping erasers,

30:26.449 --> 30:29.951
but you guys are mostly
dry-erase here, so...

30:30.019 --> 30:32.521
You know what you might
not find so funny, Mercedes,

30:32.588 --> 30:34.289
is that tampering with
an automobile's exhaust

30:34.357 --> 30:35.624
is a felony.

30:35.691 --> 30:37.626
And you can rest assured that I

30:37.693 --> 30:40.829
and my attorney, Gloria Allred,
will be pressing charges.

30:40.897 --> 30:42.264
So...

30:42.331 --> 30:44.332
Am I going to jail, or...

30:44.400 --> 30:45.667
Undetermined. Great.

30:45.735 --> 30:47.736
Get the hell out of my office.

30:52.708 --> 30:56.077
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing, do you?

30:57.246 --> 30:59.681
No. Not really.

30:59.749 --> 31:01.116
By the way, berets are out.

31:04.623 --> 31:06.924
Sorry for just coming over like this.

31:06.992 --> 31:09.660
I wanted to do this in person.

31:09.728 --> 31:12.063
Plus, I heard you have expensive beer.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.764
I'm glad you did. And I do.

31:15.501 --> 31:17.235
Look, I was out of line before...

31:17.302 --> 31:19.370
you have every right to
teach however you want.

31:19.438 --> 31:21.572
And the fact is, the
kids clearly love you.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.407
I'm a terrible teacher.

31:23.475 --> 31:25.877
Don't argue with me...
I know I am.

31:27.179 --> 31:29.480
Today...

31:29.548 --> 31:31.649
Mercedes got in trouble

31:31.717 --> 31:34.185
for shoving tots up Sue
Sylvester's tailpipe,

31:34.253 --> 31:36.521
and we were sitting in Sue's office,

31:36.588 --> 31:38.923
and Mercedes was looking at me like...

31:38.991 --> 31:41.159
And I just was totally lost.

31:41.226 --> 31:43.561
What did... What did Sue do to her?
Whatever. I don't know.

31:43.629 --> 31:45.329
She, like, suspended her or whatever.

31:45.397 --> 31:47.064
Oh! See?

31:47.132 --> 31:49.066
God, I do that every time!

31:49.134 --> 31:52.203
As soon as things get serious, I retreat.

31:52.271 --> 31:56.007
God, I... I didn't used
to be like this, you know?

31:56.074 --> 31:59.143
I...I... I was...
More like you.

31:59.211 --> 32:01.212
Spaulding High School, ten years ago.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.613
Good morning, class.

32:02.681 --> 32:04.282
I was subbing for a math teacher.

32:04.349 --> 32:06.284
The syllabus says that
you're on algorithms,

32:06.351 --> 32:08.219
so let's start with some easy ones.

32:08.287 --> 32:09.954
Let's start with you kissing my ass!

32:10.022 --> 32:11.689
Her name was cameo.

32:11.757 --> 32:13.691
She was like an attractive biggie smalls.

32:13.759 --> 32:15.626
Okay, Miss... Cameo.

32:15.694 --> 32:17.962
Miss Cameo, do you find that algorithms

32:18.030 --> 32:20.131
are hard for you to understand?

32:20.199 --> 32:21.599
Do you find my fist hard to understand?

32:21.667 --> 32:23.334
I have some really great tricks

32:23.402 --> 32:25.136
that make them very easy to learn.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.605
Tricks? What are you, some
type of magician substitute?

32:27.673 --> 32:28.539
I'm a Christian,

32:28.607 --> 32:30.441
and that devil magic stuff

32:30.509 --> 32:31.542
offends me!

32:31.610 --> 32:32.710
Cameo!

32:32.778 --> 32:34.912
I woke up in an empty classroom.

32:34.980 --> 32:37.682
They'd stolen my air Jordans.

32:37.749 --> 32:40.751
From that moment, I realized
I got to keep things moving,

32:40.819 --> 32:42.787
I got to keep it mellow and fun.

32:42.854 --> 32:44.455
Yeah, to keep from
getting your butt kicked.

32:44.523 --> 32:46.591
And I do, in all ways.

32:46.658 --> 32:49.727
I never sign more than
a month-to-month lease.

32:49.795 --> 32:51.929
I only eat off paper plates.

32:51.997 --> 32:54.098
I live on one-night stands.

32:54.166 --> 32:55.233
Last year a guy

32:55.300 --> 32:57.969
asked me to marry him; I moved.

32:59.972 --> 33:03.207
Sounds... lonely.

33:05.744 --> 33:07.678
Yeah.

33:07.746 --> 33:10.248
Well... It works for me.

33:12.884 --> 33:14.719
But it doesn't work for those kids.

33:14.786 --> 33:15.987
I'm resigning.

33:20.192 --> 33:21.726
Wow, Will.

33:21.793 --> 33:23.494
I mean, wow. What are you doing here?

33:23.562 --> 33:24.662
You should've called.

33:24.730 --> 33:26.364
I brought you some more soup.

33:26.431 --> 33:27.665
But I guess baby's feeling

33:27.733 --> 33:29.200
a lot better if he's healthy enough

33:29.268 --> 33:31.402
to have a beer with a friend!

33:31.470 --> 33:33.004
No, no. I...

33:33.071 --> 33:35.039
Hi. I'm-I'm holly Holliday.

33:35.107 --> 33:37.575
Are you a porn star or a drag queen?

33:37.643 --> 33:39.243
I'm Terri Schuester, Will's wife.

33:39.311 --> 33:40.511
Wow.

33:40.579 --> 33:42.280
Your wife's kind of a bitch.

33:42.347 --> 33:43.681
She's my ex-wife.

33:43.749 --> 33:45.750
And I have no idea what she's doing here.

33:45.817 --> 33:47.418
Do I have to remind you what went on here?

33:47.486 --> 33:48.986
Can we talk about this another time?

33:49.054 --> 33:50.688
Why, 'cause this is embarrassing
in front of your new girlfriend?

33:50.756 --> 33:52.757
Where has she been the past two days, huh?

33:52.824 --> 33:54.458
Okay, I'm just gonna go home.

33:54.526 --> 33:56.193
No.

33:56.261 --> 33:57.862
I'm sorry, Terri.

33:57.929 --> 33:59.497
Last night was a mistake.

33:59.564 --> 34:01.866
I knew it as soon as it happened.

34:01.933 --> 34:03.801
I was lonely and...

34:03.869 --> 34:05.369
You were there.

34:05.437 --> 34:07.371
I-I am sorry.

34:09.341 --> 34:11.175
No, I'm... Honey, I'm sorry.

34:11.243 --> 34:12.576
I just...

34:12.643 --> 34:14.478
I'm really out of control right now,

34:14.545 --> 34:16.880
and... I'm gonna come back.

34:16.947 --> 34:18.315
Okay?

34:18.382 --> 34:19.784
Terri. Yeah?

34:19.851 --> 34:21.252
Don't.

34:22.587 --> 34:24.088
Don't come back.

34:24.156 --> 34:26.956
This is your last chance, Will.

34:28.393 --> 34:30.094
It's never gonna happen again.

34:30.161 --> 34:32.596
If I leave now, I'm never gonna come back.

34:34.733 --> 34:37.400
You're gonna regret this, Will.

34:37.469 --> 34:40.071
I swear to God, you're gonna regret this.

34:44.476 --> 34:46.577
Are you okay?

34:46.645 --> 34:49.847
Tell me again about this
life with no consequences.

34:49.915 --> 34:51.581
It's kind of awesome.

34:54.681 --> 34:56.216
Psst!

34:56.813 --> 34:58.976
Look what I snuck in.

35:00.357 --> 35:02.083
My heart was racing.

35:02.516 --> 35:04.135
Are you out of your mind?!

35:04.136 --> 35:05.837
After what you did to Sue's Lecar?

35:05.905 --> 35:06.964
You're gonna end up in prison!

35:06.965 --> 35:09.474
So? You know what they have in prison.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.742
Tots.

35:10.810 --> 35:13.378
I'm not breaking it off with Blaine.

35:13.446 --> 35:14.613
I really like him.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.896
You are substituting
food for love, Mercedes.

35:18.213 --> 35:19.180
And more importantly,

35:19.181 --> 35:21.637
you're substituting me for a boyfriend.

35:22.532 --> 35:24.493
Look at me. Two weeks ago,

35:24.494 --> 35:27.208
I thought there was no way I'd
ever find someone like Blaine.

35:27.209 --> 35:28.437
And there he was.

35:28.505 --> 35:30.606
You will find somebody.

35:30.927 --> 35:32.260
But until then,

35:32.328 --> 35:34.596
you just got to take care of yourself.

35:34.664 --> 35:37.098
And treat yourself with a little respect.

35:38.701 --> 35:40.235
You're right.

35:40.303 --> 35:42.337
I got to go.

35:42.405 --> 35:43.738
Where?

35:43.806 --> 35:46.308
I'm gonna go talk to that Anthony kid.

35:46.375 --> 35:49.811
First time I saw him, I
thought he was kind of cute.

35:49.879 --> 35:52.080
Maybe we have a shot.

35:53.716 --> 35:55.350
Question for you.

35:55.418 --> 35:57.519
You tell anyone else what happened?

35:57.587 --> 36:00.021
How you-you kissed me?

36:00.089 --> 36:02.991
You kissed me, Karofsky, and I understand

36:03.059 --> 36:04.931
how hard this is for you to deal with,

36:04.932 --> 36:06.361
so no, I haven't told anyone.

36:06.429 --> 36:08.597
Good. You keep it that way.

36:08.664 --> 36:10.565
'Cause if you do,

36:10.633 --> 36:13.168
I'm gonna kill you.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.547
Is is where I grovel to
try to get my job back.

36:26.548 --> 36:28.782
No groveling necessary, William.

36:28.850 --> 36:31.018
I'm returning you to your position.

36:31.085 --> 36:33.687
You know, one of the marks
of a successful leader

36:33.755 --> 36:35.355
is appointing trusted lieutenants,

36:35.423 --> 36:38.824
and Ms. Holliday was
clearly not up to the job.

36:40.037 --> 36:42.205
You irritate me, William.

36:42.273 --> 36:45.575
You make the under-flaps
of my breasts burn,

36:45.643 --> 36:47.744
like when I used to rub
them with poison sumac.

36:47.811 --> 36:49.412
But your kids sure love you,

36:49.480 --> 36:51.915
as evinced by the amount
of treacly blubbering

36:51.982 --> 36:54.117
I had to sit through.

36:54.185 --> 36:56.286
Mr. Shue's the only teacher
at this school who asks you

36:56.353 --> 36:58.288
how you're doing and actually
wants to hear an answer.

36:58.355 --> 36:59.956
Mr. Shue's the only teacher at this school

37:00.024 --> 37:01.558
that ever really touched me.

37:01.625 --> 37:02.792
Besides Mr. Ryerson.

37:02.860 --> 37:04.894
He taught me how to tie my shoelaces.

37:04.962 --> 37:06.596
I used to think that I was the best thing

37:06.664 --> 37:07.564
that happened to this school, but...

37:07.631 --> 37:09.399
I was wrong.

37:09.466 --> 37:11.367
Mr. Schuester is.

37:11.435 --> 37:13.703
Mr. Shue taught me the
second half of the alphabet.

37:13.771 --> 37:15.905
I stopped after "m" and "n."

37:15.973 --> 37:18.841
I felt they were too
similar and got frustrated.

37:18.909 --> 37:20.877
You know, William, one thing I learned

37:20.945 --> 37:22.412
in my time as president...

37:22.479 --> 37:24.914
Principal.
You can't force public opinion.

37:24.982 --> 37:26.916
I pardoned you.

37:26.984 --> 37:29.152
Sometimes you got to give
the inmates what they want.

37:29.220 --> 37:31.054
You throw 'em a comb, and hope they stop

37:31.121 --> 37:33.523
beating each other long enough
to whittle it into a shiv.

37:35.693 --> 37:37.393
Well, I am relieved.

37:37.461 --> 37:39.362
I sort of thought I'd been replaced.

37:39.430 --> 37:41.064
Aw, shut your gash, Nancy.

37:42.399 --> 37:43.187
And as a condition

37:43.188 --> 37:45.841
of my not pressing charges, your Glee Club

37:45.842 --> 37:48.471
will return my Lecar to mint condition.

37:48.539 --> 37:49.606
I suggest selling yourself

37:49.673 --> 37:51.641
on craigslist under the heading

37:51.709 --> 37:53.776
of "men seeking men with butt-chins."

38:03.520 --> 38:05.755
All right, all right,
thank you very much, guys.

38:05.823 --> 38:08.191
Please, please, sit down. Just...

38:08.259 --> 38:09.559
Thank you...

38:09.627 --> 38:12.128
For that and...
And for all the kind words

38:12.196 --> 38:13.663
you said about me to Sue.

38:15.266 --> 38:16.866
The feelings are mutual.

38:16.934 --> 38:18.635
Now, we got to get crackin', though.

38:18.702 --> 38:20.803
We lost a few days there,
and it's all gonna be

38:20.871 --> 38:22.505
about focus and hard work for the next

38:22.573 --> 38:24.574
couple of days. I guess
Ms. Holliday really is gone.

38:24.642 --> 38:26.743
I know you guys liked her,
and she was a lot of fun,

38:26.810 --> 38:28.745
but she and I both agreed
that this is what was best.

38:28.812 --> 38:29.794
Don't get us wrong, Mr. Shue,

38:29.795 --> 38:31.014
we always wanted you as our teacher.

38:31.081 --> 38:32.849
She was just kind of a nice break.

38:32.916 --> 38:33.750
She did loosen us up.

38:33.751 --> 38:35.618
And she actually had
some good ideas for a sub.

38:35.686 --> 38:37.820
Yeah. I get it.

38:37.888 --> 38:39.589
And maybe we can, uh,
incorporate those...

38:39.657 --> 38:41.124
after sectionals.

38:41.191 --> 38:43.226
Now, when I'm sick,

38:43.294 --> 38:45.061
there is only one thing
that makes me feel better.

38:45.129 --> 38:46.496
Gin and juice.

38:46.563 --> 38:49.065
No. Singin' in the rain.

38:49.133 --> 38:50.466
I must've watched it, like,

38:50.534 --> 38:51.968
ten times over the past three days.

38:52.036 --> 38:53.555
It's actually what
inspired me to try this out

38:53.556 --> 38:55.805
as a contender for our
first song at sectionals.

38:55.873 --> 38:57.240
When is the song from?

38:57.308 --> 38:59.542
Well, the movie opened in 1952.

39:01.045 --> 39:02.679
But... But... But it's...
But it's really timeless.

39:06.917 --> 39:09.852
Mary Todd Lincoln in the house!

39:09.920 --> 39:12.689
My husband was probably
gay, and I'm bipolar,

39:12.756 --> 39:14.390
which makes me yell things like...

39:14.458 --> 39:17.727
"That teapot's spreading lies about me!"

39:17.795 --> 39:21.518
Or... "That can't be my baby,
because I don't love it!"

39:22.599 --> 39:24.934
Ms. Holliday, can I talk to you for a sec?

39:25.002 --> 39:26.476
Sure.

39:26.677 --> 39:28.571
Guys, practice your bipolar rants, okay?

39:28.639 --> 39:31.441
See? History can be fun!

39:31.508 --> 39:33.443
How are you holding up?

39:33.510 --> 39:34.677
Okay.

39:34.745 --> 39:37.309
I'm back to my itinerant ways, I guess.

39:38.415 --> 39:40.283
I do miss Glee Club, though.

39:40.351 --> 39:42.085
Well, as much as the kids like me,

39:42.152 --> 39:43.720
they sure do miss you.

39:43.787 --> 39:45.488
Which is why next time I'm sick,

39:45.556 --> 39:47.090
I'm requesting you as the Glee sub.

39:47.157 --> 39:49.058
Really?

39:49.126 --> 39:51.494
Mr. Schuester, that's so nice of you.

39:51.562 --> 39:54.797
It would be nice to feel like
a part of something, you know?

39:54.865 --> 39:57.166
I know.

39:57.234 --> 39:58.668
I actually need your help

39:58.736 --> 40:00.303
with something else, though.

40:00.371 --> 40:02.338
See, I've been dying to
do singin' in the rain

40:02.406 --> 40:05.341
with the kids, show them how great it is,

40:05.409 --> 40:07.810
but they're convinced
it's too old-fashioned. Mm.

40:07.878 --> 40:11.614
Would you mind helping me make
it a little more... modern?

40:13.350 --> 40:15.651
