00:02.536 --> 00:06.205
[background chatter]

00:09.109 --> 00:11.276
- Seven years ago today,
lonnie.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.578
Today.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.279
Seven years!

00:14.281 --> 00:16.280
He would have been 15!

00:16.283 --> 00:18.083
But you murdered that boy.

00:18.085 --> 00:19.218
- I'm getting
a restraining order!

00:19.220 --> 00:20.719
- I'm gonna give you
a reason

00:20.721 --> 00:23.355
To need one one day--
you and your sick-ass son!

00:28.194 --> 00:30.562
- Oh, for god's sake.
You're following us now?

00:30.564 --> 00:33.599
- You having fun, lonnie?
Huh?

00:33.601 --> 00:35.401
Life's good, isn't it?

00:35.403 --> 00:37.169
- You're not supposed to be

00:37.171 --> 00:39.071
Within 100 feet of my family.
- Don't touch me.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.439
- No, no, no.
You need to get--

00:40.441 --> 00:42.141
Ugh!
Ohh...

00:45.478 --> 00:47.780
- You all know what he did.

00:47.782 --> 00:50.349
You make me sick.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.322
- And so this brother
comes across the yard.

00:57.324 --> 00:59.425
He's all skeezed out
on crystal or something.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.127
And he says, he says,
"chicken pot pie."

01:02.129 --> 01:04.229
Like I'm supposed to know
what that is, right?

01:04.230 --> 01:06.165
So my boy looks at him,

01:06.167 --> 01:08.333
Points back at the block
and he says,

01:08.335 --> 01:10.202
"that way."

01:10.204 --> 01:12.104
Did not matter
what this cat was on.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.540
He just doubles back to where
he came from lickety-split,

01:14.542 --> 01:16.275
You know what I'm saying?

01:16.277 --> 01:18.277
- Hey, j, listen,
I got some news.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.212
Um...

01:20.214 --> 01:24.149
I had to pull some strings,
but I got you in at the cta.

01:24.151 --> 01:27.786
That's where city workers
send their loser relatives.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.221
- It's a job.

01:29.223 --> 01:34.460
- You know you sound more and
more like him every day, right?

01:34.462 --> 01:36.295
- You start Monday.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.430
- [scoffs]

01:40.800 --> 01:43.135
Okay, pop, sure.

01:43.137 --> 01:46.271
[phone buzzes]

01:46.273 --> 01:48.540
- Excuse me,
I gotta take this.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.510
Hello?

01:51.512 --> 01:54.113
- Strange how
things worked out, huh?

01:54.115 --> 01:55.414
- How's that?

01:55.416 --> 01:58.617
- When we took you in,
you were the problem.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.219
And now you're
the golden girl,

02:00.221 --> 02:01.587
And I'm the prodigal son.

02:01.589 --> 02:04.456
- Well, here we are, justin.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.492
And now you have
a second chance,

02:06.494 --> 02:08.327
So don't piss on it.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.365
- We gotta roll.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.666
I'm sorry, kid.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.347
- House belongs
to a dean masters.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.849
His file was red-flagged
to notify intelligence,

02:30.851 --> 02:32.317
But he must have been
before my time.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.386
- Oh, yeah, him.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.621
That robbery at
the art institute last year.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.222
We liked him as the fence.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.891
- The neighbors heard
a woman scream.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.692
We knocked, he yelled out
that he had a gun

02:40.694 --> 02:42.361
And to leave him alone.

02:43.863 --> 02:48.734
- Masters, this is sergeant
voight with the chicago police.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.336
Open up, make this easy
on all of us.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.572
Woman: He's gonna kill me!
- Take it.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.743
[woman screaming]

02:57.745 --> 03:00.245
- Drop it!
- I told 'em I would kill her!

03:00.247 --> 03:01.747
- Drop it, masters!

03:01.749 --> 03:03.515
- We're here to help.
- Let her go.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.350
- All we're trying to do
is have a good time.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.452
Isn't that right, huh?

03:07.454 --> 03:09.621
- Drop your weapon!
Hands in the air!

03:09.623 --> 03:13.258
- Easy, easy.
Everybody take a breath.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.627
- She set me up.
She's trying to get me killed.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.363
- Fine, you're right.
We can handle that.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.565
- I got info.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.866
I got info on a deal
that's going down,

03:20.868 --> 03:22.401
And that's why
she's setting me up.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.969
- I don't know what he--
what he's talking about.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.337
I swear to god.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.673
- All right,
we will help you.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.375
We will help you, but you've
gotta let her go first.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.410
You don't need her.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.978
Come on, give her to me.
Come on.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.680
Give her to me.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.548
- I'm dead anyway.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.217
- No!
[gunshot]

03:38.219 --> 03:39.351
[thud]

03:43.656 --> 03:45.624
- It's okay, it's okay.

03:45.626 --> 03:53.498
.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.535
"they're coming back for me.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.370
They're tying up loose ends."

03:58.372 --> 04:00.372
- We need to get her
checked out.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.607
- Okay.

04:03.543 --> 04:05.477
I want a uniform
with her at all times.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.878
And as soon as
she's medically cleared,

04:06.880 --> 04:08.413
I want her back
at the barn.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.982
- You got it.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.486
- My sister and her partner
went through this.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.288
Guy blew his brains out
in front of them

04:16.290 --> 04:17.555
On a routine call.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.659
Gabby was fine,
but it hit shay pretty hard.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.861
Don't be afraid to talk
to somebody, anybody.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.863
Me-- if it sneaks up on you.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.666
- Thanks.
- Yeah, appreciate it.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.541
- Aunt peg's here,

04:36.543 --> 04:38.777
And mom and her
are trying to play cards.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.513
- All right,
ten more minutes.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.448
- Well, according to the
agreement you signed with her,

04:43.450 --> 04:46.652
Noise cutoff time is 4:00.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.787
- Let me see that.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.456
I don't remember
signing anything.

04:56.396 --> 04:57.963
You know, your mother and I
got it all worked out.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.532
There's no need for you
to place peacemaker.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.301
- If you want to get
away from her so bad,

05:02.303 --> 05:03.902
Why don't you just
get an apartment?

05:03.904 --> 05:06.405
- I don't live in the garage
to be away from your mother.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.408
I live here
to be close to you.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.676
- Dad, that's sweet.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.444
- Yeah. Sweet.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.583
Father/daughter
dance tomorrow.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.619
Got my suit picked out.

05:20.621 --> 05:21.653
- You wanna go?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.855
- [laughs] of course!

05:27.593 --> 05:29.594
- Yeah, I'm gonna
put you on hold.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.496
Burgess, atwater.
- Hmm?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.565
- A lady over on
west vernon park

05:33.567 --> 05:35.934
Has been letting stuff
pile up in her backyard,

05:35.936 --> 05:39.004
And the buttinski neighbors
called the sheriff, apparently,

05:39.006 --> 05:41.373
Gave her 30 days
to clean it up.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.342
And I guess the old lady
hasn't done anything,

05:43.344 --> 05:45.077
So head over there,

05:45.079 --> 05:48.747
And if she hasn't made
any progress, lock her ass up.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.483
- Lock her up
for being a slob?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.485
- You know, when you're
queen for a day, burgess,

05:53.487 --> 05:55.387
You can keep
all the happy laws

05:55.389 --> 05:56.888
And get rid
of all the mean ones,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.824
But until then
move your buns, okay?

05:58.826 --> 06:00.892
- We'll bring something back
for you, sarge.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.128
Maybe she's got
an old box of personality

06:03.130 --> 06:05.130
Laying around there for you.
- Ho ho ho oh.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.466
- [chuckles]

06:09.602 --> 06:11.870
- Olinsky, your daughter's
school's on line four.

06:14.140 --> 06:18.076
- Dean masters was
a hotshot artist in his 20s.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.078
Work dried up,
picked up a drug habit.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.681
He's suspected
of not only being a fence

06:22.683 --> 06:24.616
But also forging paintings.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.451
- What was that thing
intelligence had him on?

06:26.453 --> 06:28.120
- Stolen klimt.
Never resurfaced.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.521
- What the hell
is a klimt?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.556
- An artist.
- Named klimt?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.558
- Yeah.
- That's a funny name, right?

06:33.560 --> 06:34.793
Or am I alone on this?

06:34.795 --> 06:35.894
Klimt.
Say it out loud.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.662
- It's kinda funny, yeah.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.932
- So this whole
"they're gonna kill me" thing

06:40.934 --> 06:42.834
That masters
was going on about

06:42.836 --> 06:45.604
Was either about the stolen
painting or something else.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.140
- Or he was just tripping
and talking nonsense.

06:48.142 --> 06:50.142
I mean, did you see his pupils?
He was gakked out of his mind.

06:50.144 --> 06:54.546
Took his own life rather than
face something heavy-duty.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.014
We pursue the case.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.519
- She'll take care of you.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.487
- Lindsay,
will you take this?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.624
- How you feeling?

07:05.626 --> 07:06.758
- Like hell.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.893
- Yeah.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.728
- Hey.
- Let's get a cup of coffee.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.463
- I gotta run
to lexi's school in a bit.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.998
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, it's fine.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.699
- Okay, cool.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.137
- I guess I should
thank you for last night.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.007
- Well, he chose his head
instead of yours.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.642
We all got lucky.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.611
- [sobs]

07:26.613 --> 07:27.512
I'm sorry.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.581
- It's okay.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.552
How well did you know
dean masters?

07:33.554 --> 07:36.154
- I just met him last night.

07:36.156 --> 07:41.059
It was only the third time
I've ever...Done that.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.828
I'm a licensed esthetician.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.198
I worked at a salon
up till about a week ago.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.866
I wasn't making rent.

07:47.868 --> 07:51.770
- Maybe this is a sign that
that life's not for you, huh?

07:51.772 --> 07:54.639
- Yeah.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.541
- Do you know
why dean thought

07:56.543 --> 07:57.976
You were trying
to set him up?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.077
- I don't know.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.545
I swear to god,
I got there,

08:00.547 --> 08:02.614
And--and he was pissed

08:02.616 --> 08:04.883
Because I wasn't
the girl he asked for and--

08:04.885 --> 08:06.718
- Who was he expecting?

08:09.188 --> 08:10.589
- Nadia.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.662
[knocks]

08:23.169 --> 08:24.936
- Ma'am?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.638
- Hello.
- I'm officer burgess.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.139
This is officer atwater.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.941
- Hello.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.644
- Ms. Evans,
you've exceeded the 30 days--

08:32.645 --> 08:34.613
- I'm trying.
I'm sorry.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.782
I'm trying, but I just
can't seem to...

08:37.784 --> 08:39.818
Get started.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.285
- We're gonna have to place you
under arrest, ma'am.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.821
If you could
turn around for me.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.054
- Oh, my god.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.525
- I just--I need to talk
to my partner.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.160
Real quick, ma'am.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.062
Uh-uh, mm-mm.
I'm not locking this lady up.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.031
You wanna talk
about some bad karma?

08:53.033 --> 08:56.601
- Well, I'd rather piss her off
than platt, feel me?

08:56.603 --> 08:58.970
- Wait.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.673
Ma'am, would you
do me a favor?

09:01.675 --> 09:05.176
Would you grab
that coffee can behind you?

09:05.178 --> 09:07.245
That one.
There you go.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.681
Now take that banana peel--

09:09.683 --> 09:11.016
Or whatever it is.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.585
Yep, yep, yep.

09:13.587 --> 09:18.089
Okay, now drop it
in the coffee can.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.659
Good enough for us.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.562
And please do get
your house cleaned up,

09:23.564 --> 09:25.931
Or indeed you will be arrested
by other officers.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.037
Just like that.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.644
- Guy who runs this place
is adam mazur.

09:39.646 --> 09:40.912
I know him from vice.
- Right.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.581
- Called him
the whac-a-mole pimp.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.349
We'd beat him down,
and he'd pop up somewhere else

09:44.351 --> 09:46.017
A week later
with a new stable.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.852
- Let's go.
- All right.

09:50.189 --> 09:51.690
- Membership, guys?

09:51.692 --> 09:54.626
- Yeah. Right here.

09:54.628 --> 09:57.195
- If you press an alarm,
I will break your hand.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.898
Get up against the wall. Now.
Turn around.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.134
- Chicago pd.
Everybody stay calm.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.303
Put your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.372
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

10:07.374 --> 10:11.343
How you doing, mazur?

10:11.345 --> 10:12.811
- [grunts, yells]

10:12.813 --> 10:15.113
- Got a girl named nadia?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.114
- Never heard of her.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.717
[crack]
aah!

10:18.719 --> 10:22.754
She's in room eight.
- Thank you, thank you.

10:28.227 --> 10:29.694
- Knock, knock.

10:29.696 --> 10:30.895
- I was getting
a legitimate massage.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.797
- I'll bet you were.
Get out there, come on!

10:32.799 --> 10:35.100
Go!
- [gasps]

10:35.102 --> 10:37.202
- Are you nadia?

10:37.204 --> 10:39.104
- Please don't shoot me.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.940
- I'm not gonna shoot you.
Everything's gonna be fine.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.041
All right?
- Okay.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.709
- Just come with me.
- Okay.

10:44.711 --> 10:45.710
- You'll be all right.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.279
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.148
- Oof!
- Oh!

10:50.150 --> 10:53.785
- [groaning]

10:53.787 --> 11:00.392
.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.826
- Here.
- Thanks.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.662
I think they're swollen.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.130
Seriously, dude.

11:05.132 --> 11:09.701
- I'll take your word for it.
- [breathing heavily]

11:09.703 --> 11:11.269
- Uniforms picked up nadia

11:11.271 --> 11:13.038
Trying to score over
on roosevelt.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.706
They're bringing her in.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.074
You all right?
- No.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.009
- Just checking.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.411
- Yeah, I'm glad
we're all having fun with this.

11:19.413 --> 11:22.247
Antonio,
wendy and I wanna have kids.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.848
If I'm sterile...

11:23.850 --> 11:25.684
I'm gonna have
that chick's neck.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.452
- Uh-uh.
This is all on you, ruzek.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.354
You can't let your guard down
like that, ever.

11:31.123 --> 11:32.390
- Good talk.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.859
- We found these
in lexi's locker.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.928
I know what you do
for a living,

11:36.930 --> 11:38.797
So I'm going to let you
handle it.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.132
But...
We have a zero tolerance policy.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.302
It's an automatic suspension.
One week.

11:49.975 --> 11:52.143
- What am I going to say
to your mother?

11:52.145 --> 11:55.146
- I'll hide in the garage.
Works for you.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.250
- When did you start
smoking pot?

11:59.252 --> 12:02.120
- They weren't mine, dad.
- Then whose were they?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.722
- No one's.
I found them.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.124
- Oh? Is it that senior
with the stupid name

12:06.126 --> 12:07.158
That you've been seeing?

12:07.160 --> 12:07.859
- No.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.299
- All right,
see you at home.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.868
- Dad, they're just joints.
Please don't go crazy.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.236
- It's okay.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.744
- So what can you tell me
about dean masters?

12:25.746 --> 12:28.847
- Didn't really know him.
I went on one date with the guy.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.416
- You sure about that?
I heard you were his favorite.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.952
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.821
- I bet.
[laughs]

12:36.823 --> 12:39.057
All right,
so where'd you grow up?

12:39.059 --> 12:40.525
What neighborhood?

12:40.527 --> 12:42.894
- Lake forest.
I was homecoming queen,

12:42.896 --> 12:44.329
And michael jordan
was our neighbor.

12:44.331 --> 12:48.099
I grew up there too.
I was the valedictorian.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.934
- [scoffs]

12:49.936 --> 12:51.069
- Seriously,
how old are you?

12:51.071 --> 12:54.105
You know I can find out
in two minutes.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.907
- 18 in a month.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.942
But I used a fake I.D.,
so don't hassle 'em.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.178
I need the work.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.481
- So dean mention having
any problems with anybody?

13:03.483 --> 13:06.284
- Nope.
[clears throat]

13:06.286 --> 13:09.888
- What were you trying
to score, heroin?

13:15.928 --> 13:18.496
Look...
I can get you a fix.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.333
You have my word on that.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.370
But I need
some information first.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.206
Why would dean eat a bullet?
He had enemies?

13:28.208 --> 13:31.109
- No. The opposite.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.178
Dean was the sharing type.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.181
- Give me a name.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.883
- Santa.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.118
- Guy named santa?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.920
- No, no.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.888
That's how I remembered it.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.090
"no-el."

13:46.092 --> 13:48.026
Noel. Noel harris.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.896
He owns some sort of card shop
or some deal over on polk.

13:51.898 --> 13:54.566
I don't know.
He was rambling.

13:57.136 --> 14:01.139
- Okay. Let's go.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.882
- Hey, what're you doing?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.483
- Just for a little while.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.521
- You better come back here,
bitch!

14:16.523 --> 14:19.290
I mean it!

14:25.865 --> 14:28.066
- Multiple pain-in-the-ass
neighbors have complained

14:28.068 --> 14:30.401
That you two dolts
didn't do a damn thing.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.136
- Ms. Evans was making
a good-faith effort to--

14:32.138 --> 14:34.072
- What are you,
on the stand now, burgess?

14:34.074 --> 14:38.109
Does she keep your balls
in the glove box, atwater?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.645
- Then why is she calling
the shots all the time?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.447
You go back there,

14:42.449 --> 14:45.216
And if that nutcase hasn't made
a serious dent in the clean-up,

14:45.218 --> 14:48.386
You slap some bracelets on her
and you bring her in...

14:48.388 --> 14:50.588
Or I will park you both
on crossing guard duty,

14:50.590 --> 14:52.457
Which is maybe
where you belong,

14:52.459 --> 14:55.159
'cause I got no patience
for soft cops.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.661
Now get outta here.

15:00.165 --> 15:03.268
- Sorry.
- I'll deal with this lady now.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.671
- Of course.
I understand.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.507
I'll take care of it.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.910
That was commander perry.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.445
You gotta end this.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.114
- End what?
- The rodiger family.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.448
First a restraining order.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.417
Now they've filed
a formal complaint against you

15:19.419 --> 15:21.085
With the city.
- You don't know

15:21.087 --> 15:24.255
The whole story.
- I do, actually.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.358
This unit does not need
your name and face in the papers

15:27.360 --> 15:29.427
As some "vendetta cop."

15:29.429 --> 15:32.163
Just let homicide
do their job.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.400
And what, the family's
just gonna have to eat it

15:35.402 --> 15:37.635
Every time they walk by
lonnie rodiger's house?

15:37.637 --> 15:42.206
- The world isn't fair.
You just learning this?

15:42.208 --> 15:47.178
You got potential
to be great police, halstead.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.280
So drop it.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.322
Hello?

15:57.324 --> 16:00.224
Mr. Harris?
Chicago police.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.259
[dings bell]

16:01.261 --> 16:02.427
Hello?

16:06.332 --> 16:08.733
Noel harris!

16:11.136 --> 16:12.971
- Look at this.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.673
This guy selling cards
or daisy dukes?

16:15.675 --> 16:18.509
- We're too late.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.151
Found a bunch of this
in the trash.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.553
- What's that?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.088
- You know
how you can run money

16:30.090 --> 16:32.256
Through the washer
and it doesn't rip up?

16:32.258 --> 16:34.258
That's 'cause
it's not made out of paper.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.662
It's made out of fabric.
Same stuff in blue jeans.

16:37.664 --> 16:42.233
See? Perfect texture.
This guy was good.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.268
I want you to get everybody
over to masters' house.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.204
I want that place searched
inside out.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.472
- Yeah, you got it.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.315
- Bedrooms are clear.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.085
- We're missing
20 square feet.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.653
Right there.

17:06.791 --> 17:08.726
- You got it?

17:12.131 --> 17:14.198
- Bingo.

17:14.200 --> 17:30.381
.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.751
This guy's a failed artist?
- Yep.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.453
- It's funny the things
people end up doing

17:35.455 --> 17:37.188
When they can't do
what they really want, huh?

17:37.190 --> 17:38.489
- This is agent joe hill.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.391
Secret service,
chicago field office.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.692
We go back a ways.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.127
- Where's your earpiece
and your sunglasses?

17:43.129 --> 17:45.396
- That's only
when obama's in town.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.198
- Does this mean
we're handing over the case?

17:47.200 --> 17:48.566
- No. Technically
I can't get involved

17:48.568 --> 17:50.635
Unless there's actual
counterfeit currency found,

17:50.637 --> 17:52.236
But hank just thought
I could help.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.471
- Oh.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.772
- I thought counterfeiters

17:54.774 --> 17:56.541
Were using high-end printers
nowadays.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.277
- There's digital tech that'll
print a pretty good 5 or 10,

17:59.279 --> 18:01.846
Then you pass it off at
walgreens buying dollar items.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.448
That's what we call
"baby laundering."

18:03.450 --> 18:05.416
Using plates--
this is old-school.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.384
Takes some real work.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.718
- There's three steps.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.420
The plates, the paper,
and the printer.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.755
Guess who
we're looking for now.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.091
- The hooker that kicked ruzek
in the nuts.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.594
How'd she characterize her
interaction with dean masters?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.529
- Went to his place once.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.199
- 45 text messages
between him and her

18:21.201 --> 18:24.502
Over the last two weeks.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.371
- You said you'd hook me up.
- And I will.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.474
- [crying] you gotta help me.
You gotta.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.808
- Okay, come on.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.178
Come on.

18:34.180 --> 18:37.448
Nadia. Hey.
Focus.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.816
Why'd you lie to me?

18:38.818 --> 18:41.319
- I gave you noel!
Isn't that enough?

18:41.321 --> 18:45.423
- I'll tell you
when it's enough.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.558
Do you want to get well?
Huh?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.560
I can get you the fix
that you need,

18:49.562 --> 18:52.697
But I need you to tell me
what's going on.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.133
- They said they'd kill me.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.369
- Who?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.505
- I was at dean's
a few nights ago.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.473
It was the last time
I saw him.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.675
He went out to score for us.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.244
I went out front
to have a smoke

19:06.246 --> 19:08.579
'cause he didn't like it
in the house.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.749
A group of guys with guns
walked up.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.620
One of 'em took out his cell
phone and took a picture of me,

19:15.622 --> 19:19.157
Said if I said anything
he'd find me and kill me.

19:19.159 --> 19:23.561
- Okay.
What did he look like?

19:23.563 --> 19:26.164
- Young. Black.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.465
Jeans, hoodies.

19:27.467 --> 19:32.303
I was so scared
I just...Left.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.672
But I saw them
get into this delivery van...

19:34.674 --> 19:38.709
With a jesus fish
painted on it.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.945
- What?

19:40.947 --> 19:42.680
Hey!

19:42.682 --> 19:43.948
Is this you tripping?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.750
- No. I swear to god.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.251
There was a big jesus fish

19:47.253 --> 19:49.720
Painted on the back
of the truck.

19:51.957 --> 19:53.691
- Okay.

19:57.262 --> 19:58.563
Come on.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.832
You cold?
You did good.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.368
Here.
- Now can we go score?

20:04.370 --> 20:05.503
- Soon.
- I swear to god,

20:05.505 --> 20:09.574
I'm gonna--
- you're gonna what?

20:09.576 --> 20:10.808
Huh?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.843
Do you have any idea
how many charges

20:12.845 --> 20:15.513
I could drop on you
right now?

20:15.515 --> 20:19.250
I told you I would
take care of you and I will.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.619
So I need you to take it down
a notch and wait.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.694
Come on.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.562
- Okay, pods found a match

20:31.564 --> 20:34.565
To the delivery van
with the jesus fish on the back.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.867
You know, the symbol's
actually called an ichthys--

20:36.869 --> 20:38.336
- Jin?
- Fine.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.437
You wanna keep
calling it a "jesus fish,"

20:39.439 --> 20:40.571
Knock yourself out.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.273
Also found something else.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.475
- Tabernacle?
- Yeah.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.545
This van's registered
to the tabernacle of divinity.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.747
It's a storefront church
on 63rd and cal.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.283
They use it to deliver meals
to the elderly.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.518
- That's pastor mike's place.
An ex-gd.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.721
Supposedly underwent
a jailhouse conversion

20:56.723 --> 20:57.855
A few years back.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.557
Guess it didn't take.
- All right.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.859
I'll show nadia a lineup
of this guy and his associates.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.629
If she picks anybody out,
I'll get a warrant.

21:12.304 --> 21:15.273
- Thanks, gents.
- No problem.

21:18.577 --> 21:19.710
- Brayden.
- Yeah.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.845
- Hey.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.514
Alvin olinsky.
Lexi's dad.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.982
- Yeah.
Hey...Sir.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.584
- We never actually met...

21:26.586 --> 21:28.452
Because every time you come over
to pick up my daughter

21:28.454 --> 21:30.755
You've only stayed out
in the car.

21:30.757 --> 21:33.991
- Yeah, that's my bad.

21:33.993 --> 21:37.495
- What the hell
are you looking at?

21:37.497 --> 21:39.463
- Hey, don't mind her.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.365
Do you know anything
about the joints

21:41.367 --> 21:43.367
That were found
in lexi's locker?

21:43.369 --> 21:46.337
- No, sir.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.372
- Let me have your phone.

21:51.476 --> 21:55.780
So, uh...
No texts from her today?

21:55.782 --> 21:56.981
Or did you
just erase them all?

21:56.983 --> 21:58.816
- Uh, we haven't...

21:58.818 --> 22:02.586
Talked, you know,
or texted, so...

22:02.588 --> 22:04.488
- Come here.
Come on.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.559
- Yo, am I under arrest?

22:08.561 --> 22:09.927
- Well, should you be?

22:09.929 --> 22:13.798
- No, I was just asking.
- Sit.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.669
[blowtorch hissing]

22:48.468 --> 22:51.869
- Get on the ground!
[overlapping shouting]

22:51.871 --> 22:53.571
- Put your hands
behind your head!

22:53.573 --> 22:55.406
- On the wall!

22:55.408 --> 22:57.441
- Down on your knees!
Gun!

22:57.443 --> 22:59.043
Gun!
[overlapping shouting]

22:59.045 --> 23:00.911
What? Shut up!
Get down!

23:00.913 --> 23:03.047
- Don't look at me, man.
Keep your hands up!

23:03.049 --> 23:04.448
Put 'em up higher!
- Turn around!

23:04.450 --> 23:06.717
Put your hands back!
Think I'm kidding you?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.519
- Gimme this one.
Palm to the sky.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.521
- God's soldier, huh, mike?

23:10.523 --> 23:11.922
He bless you
with all this cash?

23:11.924 --> 23:14.458
- Man, those are just donations
for our meals on wheels.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.761
Hey, keep y'all mouths shut!
Don't say nothing!

23:24.536 --> 23:26.036
- No plates.
No paper.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.706
No sign
of any printing operation.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.541
- We really think pastor mike
has the skills

23:30.543 --> 23:32.877
For counterfeiting?

23:34.746 --> 23:37.915
- I got a text from lexi
asking where you are.

23:37.917 --> 23:42.486
Text her back.
"I'm busy, what's up?"

23:52.764 --> 23:54.799
[phone buzzes]

23:57.502 --> 24:00.438
Read it.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.507
- "I think my dad knows
I was holding for you."

24:07.612 --> 24:12.216
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

24:12.218 --> 24:14.051
My applications
went out for college,

24:14.053 --> 24:17.121
And I couldn't have those joints
on my record, you know?

24:21.493 --> 24:23.127
- Stand up.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.876
I don't ever want
to see you again.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.144
- Ow.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.012
You won't, sir.

24:42.014 --> 24:45.182
- Yeah. Starting now.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.518
Go.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.532
- Ma'am?
- I've been cleaning.

25:01.534 --> 25:04.134
In my bedroom,
in the back.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.769
- We'll need to see it.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.505
- I promise you.

25:07.507 --> 25:10.975
Or we're going to have
to place you under arrest.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.743
- Okay.

25:22.621 --> 25:25.289
Look, see? It's all here.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.224
I've been working on it.

25:27.226 --> 25:30.594
Now please...
Leave.

25:30.596 --> 25:34.098
[faint sound]

25:34.100 --> 25:36.267
- Did you hear that?
- No. What?

25:36.269 --> 25:38.669
- It's back there.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.871
- Do not go down there!
You're not allowed!

25:40.873 --> 25:42.273
No. Get out!
- What's in there?

25:42.275 --> 25:44.608
- Nothing.
You need to leave.

25:44.610 --> 25:45.609
You have no right
to be in here.

25:45.611 --> 25:46.810
- Yeah, we do.
Open it.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.679
- No!

25:48.681 --> 25:50.147
No, get away from there!
- Ma'am!

25:50.149 --> 25:51.582
- [screaming] no!
- Ma'am!

25:51.584 --> 25:54.752
- Get away!
No! No!

25:54.754 --> 25:59.823
[woman continues screaming
in background]

26:18.843 --> 26:20.611
- [whimpers]

26:20.613 --> 26:23.013
- Chicago pd!

26:26.618 --> 26:29.219
[whimpering continues]

26:42.767 --> 26:44.602
Oh, my god.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.837
- [whimpering]

26:46.839 --> 26:54.945
.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.314
- [whimpers]

26:57.316 --> 27:01.085
- Hey, it's okay.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.854
- Mama said no strangers.

27:05.824 --> 27:09.893
- Okay, but it's all right now.
You're safe.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.731
Come here.

27:16.835 --> 27:18.936
It's okay.
Yeah.

27:18.938 --> 27:22.039
It's okay, it's okay.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.341
It's okay.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.345
It's okay.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.848
- We owe you an apology,
pastor mike.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.216
- That's a start.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.784
- I mean, here we were
thinking you're the brains

27:33.786 --> 27:35.052
Behind a counterfeit ring.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.353
But really
you're a small-time charlie

27:36.355 --> 27:38.789
Who's too dumb to know
you've been played.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.858
- Naw. "the sufferings
of this present time

27:40.860 --> 27:43.861
Are not worth comparing
to the glories of god."

27:43.863 --> 27:46.063
That's romans.

27:46.065 --> 27:49.767
- [laughs]

27:54.906 --> 27:56.874
- Mm.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.942
- Uh-oh.

27:58.944 --> 28:00.844
- That's some kind of trick.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.713
- Your crew took out
noel harris.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.148
Dean masters knew
he was on your list.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.817
He freaks out,
kills himself first.

28:06.819 --> 28:10.888
- And the problem is...
You got paid in funny money.

28:16.928 --> 28:17.995
- Why don't you tell us
who hired you

28:17.997 --> 28:19.830
For the hit on harris.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.899
I'll talk
to the state's attorney,

28:21.901 --> 28:26.403
See about you getting 20 years
instead of life.

28:26.405 --> 28:27.871
All right.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.841
Pastor mike was contracted
by this man...

28:30.843 --> 28:33.310
Glen ward.

28:33.312 --> 28:37.381
Now, ward has done federal time
in leavenworth

28:37.383 --> 28:38.982
For counterfeiting.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.051
But how ward
and his printing crew

28:41.053 --> 28:42.453
Hooked up with dean masters
and noel harris

28:42.455 --> 28:43.887
Is anybody's guess,
and why the two of them

28:43.889 --> 28:45.422
Are both dead now, who knows?

28:45.424 --> 28:47.758
- Pastor mike didn't say
why ward wanted them dead?

28:47.760 --> 28:49.793
- He didn't ask.
- It could be any reason.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.228
Somebody wanted a bigger cut,

28:51.230 --> 28:53.063
Threatened to snitch,
banged somebody's girlfriend.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.732
- Any one of those scenarios.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.934
- One of ward's aliases
is denis diderot.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.803
- A counterfeiter
and a fan of french literature.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.038
Can't wait to meet him.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.439
- Hey, sarge.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.341
Jin just did a name check

29:04.343 --> 29:06.744
Against new leases
on commercial property rentals.

29:06.746 --> 29:07.945
He got a hit.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.981
Foreclosed chemical building
on cicero.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.816
- All right, unless anyone's
opposed to overtime,

29:12.818 --> 29:14.284
Let's go find our printer.

29:14.286 --> 29:15.986
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.755
This is the part
where I'm supposed to tell you

29:17.757 --> 29:19.156
Secret service
is taking over the case.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.491
- No, no, no.
We had a deal.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.826
I get the bad guys.
You get the counterfeit money.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.862
- That's why I'm waiting
until morning to do it.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.807
- Hey.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.408
- Why did you do that?

29:42.313 --> 29:44.381
- Lexi...

29:44.383 --> 29:46.250
He's a dirtbag.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.418
- Now all my friends know
that you threatened him

29:48.420 --> 29:49.853
Over a couple of joints?

29:49.855 --> 29:54.124
About a couple of joints.
It doesn't matter.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.860
This guy was perfectly happy
to let you take the ride.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.295
He's not a man.
He never will be.

29:58.297 --> 30:01.799
And he doesn't deserve you.

30:01.801 --> 30:02.900
Lexi.

30:12.544 --> 30:15.512
- Look who I found loitering
at the top of the stairs.

30:15.514 --> 30:16.980
- Is everything all right?

30:16.982 --> 30:19.283
- Yeah. Yeah, it's all good,
pop.

30:19.285 --> 30:22.286
- What's up?

30:23.922 --> 30:26.824
- So this is where you hand down
commands to your crew, huh?

30:26.826 --> 30:29.827
- This is it.
'bout to roll out, actually.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.062
- Cool. Hey, uh, actually
wanna talk to you

30:32.064 --> 30:33.864
About something
real quick, pop.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.834
- Uh-huh.
- So I got a chance...

30:36.836 --> 30:39.837
I got a chance to get in
on the ground floor

30:39.839 --> 30:42.339
Of a business that my buddy's
putting together.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.874
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, there is no ceiling

30:43.876 --> 30:45.509
On how profitable
this could get.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.878
- What is it?
- Recycling

30:47.880 --> 30:49.913
And refurbishing cell phones.

30:49.915 --> 30:52.549
My buddy's got a whole new
business model, though.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.218
He's coming at it
from a whole new angle.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.887
I feel like this could
really set me up, pop.

30:56.889 --> 31:00.424
- 10 grand. But I can get it
back to you in a month.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.292
Two months, max.
- What makes you think

31:02.294 --> 31:03.994
I got 10 grand laying around?

31:03.996 --> 31:06.230
- I know you got side income.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.365
- What's that
supposed to mean?

31:08.367 --> 31:12.002
- I'm not a kid anymore, dad.
I know you do things your way.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.337
I even heard things
when I was inside

31:13.339 --> 31:15.939
About you charging
street taxes?

31:15.941 --> 31:18.575
- You heard wrong.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.978
- All right. Then what about
mom's life insurance?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.980
I know you still got
some of that in the bank.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.015
Aren't I entitled
to a piece of that?

31:25.017 --> 31:29.152
- Justin, most of that
was used for your legal fees.

31:29.154 --> 31:31.655
Look, I'll tell you what.

31:31.657 --> 31:34.024
You put six months
under your vest at cta--

31:34.026 --> 31:36.994
- I need the money now,
not six months from now.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.428
In six months,
the deal is dead.

31:43.434 --> 31:45.535
- Andy morrissey at cta.

31:45.537 --> 31:48.005
He's expecting your call.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.048
- Copy that.

31:59.651 --> 32:02.119
- He was listed as
a missing person in south dakota

32:02.121 --> 32:03.553
Four years ago.

32:03.555 --> 32:08.659
Dad's out of the picture.
Fell through the cracks.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.961
You okay?

32:13.531 --> 32:15.332
- Yeah.

32:27.045 --> 32:29.446
- It's quiet out front.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.162
- Looks like
ward's ready to roll.

32:49.033 --> 32:51.268
- We got eyes in there yet?

32:51.270 --> 32:53.070
- No. Almost there.
Stand by.

32:56.574 --> 33:00.110
All right, we're up.
Counterfeit central.

33:02.447 --> 33:05.449
All right, give 'er a spin.
- All right.

33:05.451 --> 33:06.717
There's two.

33:06.719 --> 33:09.553
- Three,
and...Four.

33:09.555 --> 33:13.523
- Any artillery?
- I can't tell.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.392
- We're going in.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.735
- Chicago pd!
- Watch out--the police!

33:24.737 --> 33:26.103
- Halt!

33:26.105 --> 33:47.624
.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.693
- I got ward!
- I got this one!

33:49.695 --> 33:53.563
- Don't move! Don't move!
Drop it!

34:04.542 --> 34:06.176
- Stay down!

34:06.178 --> 34:08.678
- Uhh!

34:14.152 --> 34:18.255
- Gun on the dash.
Hands on your head! Now!

34:20.757 --> 34:23.092
- George 5021 emergency.

34:23.094 --> 34:25.328
Shots fired by the police
and at the police.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.065
Roll an ambo
to 1356 south 13th street.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.632
Notify the dicks
and crime lab.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.068
Plainclothes officers
at the scene.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.436
Can I get you a t-shirt,
big fella?

34:32.438 --> 34:34.638
- You good?
- Too bad it ain't real.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.574
- Lindsay, get a picture of me
for my album cover.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.676
- You're an idiot.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.579
- Call agent hill, tell him
we found the mother lode.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.514
Secret service comes in,
takes the credit.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.083
- You want your face
[phone buzzing]

34:47.085 --> 34:49.186
On the front page of the paper?
