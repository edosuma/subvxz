00:34.291 --> 00:35.250
Odd!

00:38.458 --> 00:39.375
Odd?

00:53.916 --> 00:54.791
Odd?

00:56.166 --> 00:57.166
Rose?

01:05.541 --> 01:06.625
What are you doing?

01:11.041 --> 01:14.750
I'm the head of a funeral parlor
with one funeral scheduled,

01:16.416 --> 01:17.375
Dad's,

01:18.416 --> 01:19.625
which I'm paying for.

01:21.208 --> 01:26.458
For four generations before me,
this funeral parlor has survived, but now…

01:30.666 --> 01:32.750
It's all falling apart.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.000
It can't be that bad.

01:37.666 --> 01:38.625
Can it?

01:42.875 --> 01:43.958
Phone's ringing.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.583
Can you answer it?

01:50.208 --> 01:52.458
Hallangen Funeral Parlor, Odd speaking.

01:53.541 --> 01:54.416
Yes, it's me.

01:56.541 --> 01:57.708
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:58.208 --> 01:59.500
Do you have the name?

02:00.750 --> 02:02.291
Something to write with?

02:02.375 --> 02:05.333
Just a second. I have to find a pen.

02:07.916 --> 02:08.958
Left.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.458
Yes. No, I'm still here.

02:11.708 --> 02:12.708
Just a second.

02:13.375 --> 02:14.583
Put it there.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.416
Yeah, let's see…

02:17.500 --> 02:19.041
When did you say she was born?

02:20.041 --> 02:23.333
…six-thirty, and the rest?

02:24.083 --> 02:26.583
3-7-4-7-3.

02:26.666 --> 02:30.625
That's good. Thank you.
No, thank you. I'll be there soon. Yes.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.000
Goodbye.

02:32.083 --> 02:32.916
Yes!

02:34.541 --> 02:36.333
-What?
-Mrs. Gundersen is dead!

02:37.541 --> 02:38.875
-Is that true?
-Yes!

02:38.958 --> 02:39.791
No.

02:39.875 --> 02:40.708
Yes!

02:40.791 --> 02:43.166
She's lived with us
for a really long time.

02:45.000 --> 02:45.833
Yeah.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.625
-Yeah.
-But she doesn't any longer.

02:49.375 --> 02:52.583
I'm sorry,
but this is sort of our meal ticket.

02:52.666 --> 02:54.333
I have to get going.

02:55.291 --> 02:57.583
Hey, Rose, can you cover Dad up?

03:35.416 --> 03:38.000
A NETFLIX SERIES

04:13.375 --> 04:18.708
"Did Arvid have any enemies in town?"

04:21.958 --> 04:24.541
"Could anyone have wanted
to murder Ar…" No, wait.

04:25.708 --> 04:29.750
"Could anyone have wanted
to end Arvid's life," I think.

04:29.833 --> 04:32.541
Practicing what you're going to say
to Odd and Live?

04:35.416 --> 04:38.583
Remember that your priority
is to reassure them.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.333
Of course.

04:40.416 --> 04:43.625
Tell them that
there's probably nothing to worry about.

04:44.291 --> 04:48.375
We're investigating it,
but let's not over-dramatize.

04:48.458 --> 04:50.625
No, but at the same time,

04:50.708 --> 04:54.208
it's a small town where no one ever dies,
is what I'm thinking.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.125
Yeah, but you know what I mean.

05:07.541 --> 05:12.750
HALLANGEN FUNERAL PARLOR

05:16.958 --> 05:18.083
Bonjour, Mathieu!

05:18.791 --> 05:19.791
Hi, Odd.

05:22.833 --> 05:25.208
-Had a long night, did you?
-You could say that.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.125
-Second door on the right.
-Yeah.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.375
The sons arrived an hour ago.

05:36.625 --> 05:38.583
Could you help me with one small thing?

05:39.166 --> 05:40.291
-Sure.
-Thanks.

05:43.416 --> 05:46.708
Let's lift her onto the stretcher,
and I'll handle the rest.

05:46.791 --> 05:50.875
When we have… When the family
has picked the casket and all that.

05:50.958 --> 05:51.958
Let's see.

05:53.583 --> 05:54.666
Stand down there.

05:56.458 --> 05:59.583
Now we'll raise the bed. There we go.

06:00.833 --> 06:02.583
We'll let gravity do some of the work.

06:03.125 --> 06:04.208
Like Dad used to say,

06:04.291 --> 06:07.208
"It's stupid to give yourself a hernia
because of a body."

06:14.916 --> 06:16.083
Hello, Mrs. Gundersen.

06:18.125 --> 06:21.500
"Mrs. Margit Constance Gundersen."

06:21.583 --> 06:24.000
"Born June 21, 1930." Yeah, that's right.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.458
Let's do this.

06:27.708 --> 06:31.333
It was not a pleasant exit from life
for Margit.

06:31.416 --> 06:33.041
She wasn't ready to go.

06:33.125 --> 06:35.125
She clearly fought for her life.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.875
Who knows who decides
when it's our turn to die?

06:38.625 --> 06:41.291
But one thing is certain. It's not fair.

06:45.833 --> 06:49.291
I can't find anything on the surveillance
videos from the gas station.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.125
But what did you expect?

06:51.208 --> 06:54.416
That Arvid and the killer
had a dramatic fight

06:54.500 --> 06:57.166
that was caught by the camera
near the gas pumps?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.458
-No…
-And then they went to the crematorium?

06:59.541 --> 07:00.416
No.

07:00.500 --> 07:04.125
Did you do the paperwork
for the one who died at Soltun?

07:04.791 --> 07:07.000
-Yes, Margit Gundersen.
-Great.

07:07.583 --> 07:11.708
Then… we can go have a bun at the bakery.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.500
Am I the only one
working on two suspicious deaths here?

07:20.583 --> 07:22.250
You mean the old lady at Soltun?

07:22.750 --> 07:24.791
No, Live Hallangen. Jesus!

07:24.875 --> 07:25.875
She woke up again.

07:25.958 --> 07:28.416
-Yeah, after she died.
-Yes, but she woke up again.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.875
And, Arvid, we have no leads.
You said so yourself.

07:33.958 --> 07:36.833
I'm going to do everything in my power
to solve this case.

07:37.666 --> 07:41.000
I just can't… I can't imagine
how painful it must be for Live…

07:41.500 --> 07:45.250
Poor thing.
Not knowing how her father died.

07:46.125 --> 07:46.958
And for Odd.

07:47.958 --> 07:48.958
For both of them.

07:49.875 --> 07:52.625
I had a colleague when I worked
as an officer in Kongsvinger.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.583
A very dedicated policeman,
kind of like you.

07:55.666 --> 07:58.791
Except that he could take home
any woman he wanted.

07:59.625 --> 08:03.041
Married, single…
He could have been a model.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.625
But he chose

08:05.500 --> 08:07.375
to be a policeman in Kongsvinger.

08:08.291 --> 08:09.791
Yeah, what's your point?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.166
He never went home.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.875
Not to his own house or anyone else's.

08:15.958 --> 08:19.541
He just sat in his office
day in and day out, fighting crime.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.625
-He was really good.
-Yeah?

08:22.166 --> 08:23.458
Where is he now?

08:23.541 --> 08:24.708
He's dead now.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.291
Was he killed?

08:26.958 --> 08:28.166
Heart attack.

08:28.833 --> 08:29.708
On the toilet.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.875
Yeah, but what's the moral of the story?

08:35.916 --> 08:37.541
I have a really nice niece.

08:38.708 --> 08:40.708
Lykke. You know her. She's a nice girl.

08:40.791 --> 08:43.375
Some might say she's mousy,

08:43.458 --> 08:46.208
that she's about as much fun
as decaffeinated coffee,

08:46.291 --> 08:50.000
that she has the charisma of a frying pan,
but she's damn nice.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.708
Perhaps the last single lady in Skarnes.

08:54.791 --> 08:56.708
That's… That's 100% wrong.

08:56.791 --> 08:59.291
-That's… Live is also still single.
-Yeah.

08:59.375 --> 09:02.458
That's a project
you may want to give up on.

09:06.791 --> 09:10.041
Take Lykke out
to the Chinese place, Reinert.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.625
The Chinese place, right.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.458
This here… is what I'm going
to spend time on.

09:16.666 --> 09:18.750
How many people in Skarnes

09:18.833 --> 09:22.958
have the strength
to crush seven ribs in this way?

09:25.708 --> 09:29.625
What are you going to do about it?
Go through the gym's membership lists?

09:29.708 --> 09:33.333
Yeah, maybe I'll start there,
and keep working from there,

09:33.916 --> 09:35.458
and do some police work.

09:35.541 --> 09:36.458
Heart attack.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.208
-Crushed ribs.
-On the toilet.

09:40.291 --> 09:41.791
Yeah, in Skarnes.

09:41.875 --> 09:42.875
On the toilet!

09:44.500 --> 09:46.000
One, two, three.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.000
There.

09:53.958 --> 09:54.791
That's good.

10:04.458 --> 10:05.833
Oh my! Mrs. Gundersen!

10:11.125 --> 10:12.458
Yeah, let's see.

10:14.125 --> 10:15.125
Let's see.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.000
There.

10:19.666 --> 10:21.625
Let's see, just need to lower the bed.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.208
You talked to the Gundersen boys?

10:27.291 --> 10:29.208
-I gave them some coffee.
-Good.

10:36.208 --> 10:37.541
Well, we're out of here.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.458
One, two… There.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
-Oh dear.
-Sorry.

11:00.541 --> 11:01.708
-Hi, Live.
-Hi.

11:02.541 --> 11:04.750
Sorry, we didn't know there was…

11:04.833 --> 11:06.916
-Odd said we could come in.
-Yeah.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.000
I was just going to…

11:09.875 --> 11:10.875
My condolences.

11:11.625 --> 11:12.708
Thank you so much.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.000
And thank you ever so much, Live, for…

11:16.750 --> 11:19.333
We haven't been here
as much as we should have.

11:19.416 --> 11:22.791
But we knew Mom was fine
as long as you were here.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.791
Every time we spoke with her on the phone,

11:24.875 --> 11:27.208
she told us what Live had said and…

11:27.291 --> 11:29.166
Or what Live had done.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.250
-She loved you very, very much.
-Very, very much.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.291
Yeah, she was

11:34.250 --> 11:35.583
an amazing woman, so…

11:37.250 --> 11:39.250
I'm very sorry about this.

11:39.750 --> 11:43.500
In many ways,
you kept her alive towards the end.

11:45.916 --> 11:48.708
Yeah. Well, I have to… get going.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.625
Yeah.

11:51.208 --> 11:52.500
Thank you, anyway.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.250
I don't need it.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.541
Stone: blue gneiss.

12:44.625 --> 12:46.166
Text: Arvid Hallangen.

12:46.250 --> 12:49.541
Font: Times New Roman, italics.
Color: white.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.333
Church: Udnes, of course.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.166
Programs: 75. Flowers…

12:55.125 --> 12:57.583
Ornament, song… He's decided everything.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.333
What are you talking about?

12:59.416 --> 13:03.041
When someone dies,
you're supposed to create a case file.

13:03.958 --> 13:05.541
He did it himself long ago,

13:05.625 --> 13:08.583
and filled in everything
we're supposed to spend 4-5 hours on…

13:09.375 --> 13:11.041
Apart from the casket, maybe.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.500
Then maybe he should get
the expensive mahogany casket

13:14.583 --> 13:16.208
you never sold?

13:16.291 --> 13:18.500
Yeah. No, he has written,

13:19.708 --> 13:23.291
"Use a model Odd has scratched up
or dented and we can't get a refund for."

13:23.375 --> 13:24.208
Yeah.

13:25.666 --> 13:27.625
And I know where that one is, so…

13:28.250 --> 13:29.166
Fine.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.583
Except for the eulogy.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.375
Which I was wondering if you would do.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.041
-No.
-No?

13:39.625 --> 13:42.416
I understand that you don't want to.
Neither do I, but…

13:44.000 --> 13:47.333
I just thought that, since it's
my first funeral as head of the parlor,

13:47.416 --> 13:48.833
it's kind of important to…

13:49.375 --> 13:52.250
Isn't it important
that I look steady and strong and…

13:52.333 --> 13:53.958
This isn't the '50s, Odd.

13:54.041 --> 13:58.125
If you start crying at your father's
funeral, no one will raise an eyebrow.

14:04.541 --> 14:07.625
Okay, I'll… I'll do it.

14:09.458 --> 14:10.375
Thank you.

14:14.916 --> 14:16.125
What's going on with your eye?

14:17.166 --> 14:18.291
-Nothing?
-Yeah.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.500
There's a green spot on it.

14:22.583 --> 14:23.416
Huh?

15:12.083 --> 15:16.583
How can you stuff your face with a bun
when there's a killer loose in Skarnes?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.458
Arvid was loved.

15:19.833 --> 15:20.666
Yeah.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.333
So was Kennedy.

15:23.375 --> 15:26.125
-And Gandhi and…
-I haven't said we won't investigate it.

15:26.208 --> 15:27.833
-No, but…
-Reinert.

15:27.916 --> 15:31.708
Has anyone told you about the strange
deaths we had in the early '90s?

15:31.791 --> 15:34.916
-You think… You think they're connected?
-No…

15:36.375 --> 15:37.541
I was around your age.

15:38.375 --> 15:39.666
Young and eager.

15:39.750 --> 15:43.500
And totally convinced that there was
a killer on the loose in Skarnes.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.500
And that I was the only one
who could catch him.

15:49.083 --> 15:50.000
Or her.

15:53.041 --> 15:58.541
Sometimes, a lot of people
happen to die around the same time.

15:59.541 --> 16:02.416
I was so obsessed
with solving this case that I…

16:02.916 --> 16:04.958
I became the lady who cried wolf.

16:05.916 --> 16:07.500
It became quite uncomfortable.

16:08.791 --> 16:10.833
I felt like I had something to prove.

16:11.875 --> 16:15.750
So I… I was a little rough
with the suspect.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.791
I couldn't have known that
she struggled with her own demons,

16:19.875 --> 16:23.416
and that my investigation
would be the straw that made her…

16:30.125 --> 16:31.291
Was it Live's mother?

16:35.750 --> 16:37.125
So you understand

16:38.166 --> 16:42.916
why I don't want to go into that house
and cry "murder" before I have to.

16:43.416 --> 16:44.625
No, of course.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.666
At the same time,
I think it's very important

16:56.750 --> 16:59.166
that we show Live
that we're doing all we can

16:59.750 --> 17:01.250
to figure this out.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.041
For what happened to her
and what happened to Arvid.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.833
Sure, Reinert.

17:05.916 --> 17:09.458
Everyone in Skarnes, including Live,
knows what you would do for her.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.958
DEAR DAD

17:20.750 --> 17:21.625
Hi, Live.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.083
Hi.

17:26.291 --> 17:27.375
How are you feeling?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.541
Are you sleeping at night?

17:38.125 --> 17:38.958
Yeah.

17:41.833 --> 17:44.875
Could you come by this afternoon
for some more tests?

17:44.958 --> 17:45.791
I'm fine.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.083
Okay.

17:51.333 --> 17:54.375
FUNERALS

18:51.375 --> 18:53.250
Burger. Yes.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.750
Yeah, how's it going at work?

18:58.916 --> 19:01.250
No, that's confidential.

19:01.333 --> 19:04.250
Yeah, because Aunt Judith said

19:04.333 --> 19:06.416
that work is your life.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.375
Yeah, that's right.

19:09.458 --> 19:12.083
So we won't have
anything to talk about on…

19:12.791 --> 19:13.958
on dates?

19:14.041 --> 19:14.916
Right.

19:15.708 --> 19:17.791
Should we just go home and fuck, then?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.875
"On a day

19:30.541 --> 19:32.333
like this."

19:36.833 --> 19:38.000
Then…

19:51.750 --> 19:53.416
"Dear Dad, as…

19:55.416 --> 19:57.833
we're standing here

19:59.041 --> 20:00.750
today…"

20:14.791 --> 20:18.083
"You have buried over 1,000 people
throughout your career, many of whom…"

20:45.791 --> 20:46.625
Oh my…

21:04.958 --> 21:06.666
Hey! What the fuck?

21:10.625 --> 21:13.166
-It made so much noise.
-Noise?

21:13.250 --> 21:15.416
-Yeah.
-From the lawnmower?

21:16.833 --> 21:17.708
Yes.

21:17.791 --> 21:19.583
Are you kidding? Have you lost your mind?

21:20.750 --> 21:25.291
I'm not the one who bought a robot
to cut 22 square feet of grass.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.916
No, because you can't even
afford garden shears.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.708
What did Aunt Judith say
to make you agree to go on this date?

21:39.583 --> 21:40.791
That…

21:41.416 --> 21:46.000
"You just have to meet my…
my nymphomaniac niece."

21:57.083 --> 21:58.250
God damn it!

22:02.083 --> 22:02.958
It's Live.

22:24.041 --> 22:25.375
Live!

22:30.041 --> 22:31.416
Reinert?

22:43.750 --> 22:44.583
Reinert?

22:56.916 --> 22:59.041
What the fuck is wrong with you?

23:46.625 --> 23:48.541
Hi, it's Live. Leave a message.

23:49.125 --> 23:50.541
Hi, Live. It's Reinert.

23:52.750 --> 23:53.750
I just wanted to

23:54.833 --> 23:55.750
talk.

23:57.166 --> 23:58.375
So if…

23:59.583 --> 24:03.000
If you can call me back,
that would be great, just for a talk.

24:04.750 --> 24:05.583
Goodbye.

24:06.125 --> 24:07.166
What are you doing?

24:10.333 --> 24:11.375
Well?

24:11.458 --> 24:13.333
The idea is… I know it's--

24:13.416 --> 24:14.250
Red yarn?

24:16.166 --> 24:18.166
Since when does the police use red yarn?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.333
-Live--
-Did you take Marianne's yarn?

24:24.666 --> 24:26.833
-Reinert, take it down.
-Yeah, I--

24:26.916 --> 24:29.458
Take it down, Reinert,
and go home for the weekend.

24:31.625 --> 24:33.541
And we'll talk on Monday.

24:33.625 --> 24:36.541
-Judith, I think you'll want to hear--
-That's an order. Bye!

24:36.625 --> 24:37.625
Take it all down.

24:49.458 --> 24:52.958
Arvid Hallangen shows clear signs
that his ribs were broken.

24:53.041 --> 24:55.375
That doesn't happen
if he falls backwards down the stairs.

24:55.458 --> 24:57.125
Someone must have pushed him.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.208
He lost his balance…

25:45.500 --> 25:47.833
I have to kill to keep my family safe.

25:49.166 --> 25:50.708
To defend them from myself.

25:51.333 --> 25:54.250
But, every time I kill,
I put them in danger.

25:54.833 --> 25:56.625
I'm worried about Live.

25:58.166 --> 25:59.750
What if she inherited this from me?

26:12.500 --> 26:13.708
I need blood.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.500
I need blood.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.166
I can't take it.

26:34.500 --> 26:35.500
I can't take it.

27:43.083 --> 27:45.041
I need blood.

27:46.083 --> 27:47.291
Be quiet.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.166
I need blood.

27:51.958 --> 27:53.333
Be quiet.

27:55.958 --> 27:56.791
Live?

28:00.416 --> 28:02.291
Hello? Are you there?

28:07.375 --> 28:08.208
Live?

28:10.375 --> 28:11.208
Live?

28:11.750 --> 28:12.875
Come in.

28:16.833 --> 28:18.458
-Hi
-Hi.

28:20.625 --> 28:21.750
Are you okay?

28:21.833 --> 28:22.666
Sure.

28:25.541 --> 28:27.083
You have to get ready.

28:28.833 --> 28:29.833
For what?

28:30.708 --> 28:31.875
The funeral?

28:31.958 --> 28:34.000
Yeah, but that's not until Thursday.

28:36.875 --> 28:37.958
Today is Thursday.

28:41.250 --> 28:42.791
It's pretty normal to lose

28:43.583 --> 28:45.541
track of time when grieving.

28:45.625 --> 28:47.041
It'll pass.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.083
We just have to

28:48.958 --> 28:51.666
get over the worst hurdle,
and everything will be fine.

28:52.666 --> 28:54.291
Yeah, we can do that.

28:55.083 --> 28:58.041
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah, just go on ahead. I'll be there.

29:08.958 --> 29:12.208
She… I don't know,
she'll probably be there.

29:12.833 --> 29:14.958
Don't you have enough to worry about, Odd?

29:15.708 --> 29:17.291
What's going on with that knot?

29:18.833 --> 29:22.125
I know how to tie a tie.
I've done it myself since kindergarten.

29:22.208 --> 29:23.958
Sure, it just looks a bit crooked.

29:24.041 --> 29:25.416
-Is it too tight?
-No.

29:26.375 --> 29:29.041
No one is expecting you
to stand at the door

29:29.125 --> 29:31.041
and arrange your own dad's funeral, honey.

29:31.125 --> 29:32.458
Yes, they are actually.

29:33.791 --> 29:38.708
If I can't handle my own father's funeral,
no one will bring their parents to me or

29:39.541 --> 29:40.541
anyone.

29:40.625 --> 29:42.708
You look really nice anyway.

29:44.458 --> 29:45.500
Very professional.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.791
I'll go as far as to say,

29:47.875 --> 29:51.500
you're the handsomest funeral director
in the entire Hallangen family.

29:52.083 --> 29:55.041
For the time being, I'm the only
funeral director in the family.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.208
I mean, ever.

30:02.625 --> 30:03.708
Thanks for trying.

30:05.041 --> 30:06.666
-I have to go to the church.
-Yeah.

30:07.208 --> 30:08.250
I'll see you there.

30:08.791 --> 30:09.875
Yeah.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.250
"Dearly loved, sorely missed"?

31:03.541 --> 31:04.750
"Live, Rose…

31:07.875 --> 31:09.083
and Dodd"?

31:16.333 --> 31:17.166
"Dodd"?

31:23.458 --> 31:25.291
Should I ask them to print another one?

31:26.125 --> 31:27.000
It's too late!

31:27.875 --> 31:28.750
But, Odd…

31:28.833 --> 31:30.041
Don't you mean "Dodd"?

31:30.125 --> 31:33.666
Fucking hell,
can't those morons at Skarnes Flowers

31:33.750 --> 31:35.791
learn to double-check their spelling?

31:35.875 --> 31:37.875
Fucking hell!

31:41.250 --> 31:42.125
Hi there.

31:42.208 --> 31:43.041
Hi.

31:43.791 --> 31:44.750
Are you ready?

31:45.666 --> 31:46.500
Yes.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.000
My condolences.

32:12.750 --> 32:13.791
My condolences.

32:15.416 --> 32:16.500
My condolences.

32:17.166 --> 32:18.791
Yeah, hi. Thanks.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.750
I wish there was something I could do.

32:22.750 --> 32:24.875
You can give me
more time to pay off Dad's loan.

32:30.750 --> 32:31.666
Hi.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.333
My condolences.

32:51.125 --> 32:52.541
-We'll talk later?
-Yeah.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.666
-I need to talk to you about something.
-Reinert.

33:26.875 --> 33:30.375
-I think I may have figured out that…
-After the funeral.

33:30.916 --> 33:32.416
-Yeah, but--
-Hush!

33:45.083 --> 33:46.291
-Judith, please--
-Hush.

33:58.666 --> 34:03.541
We are gathered here today
to say goodbye to Arvid Hallangen

34:03.625 --> 34:05.833
and surrender him into God's hands.

34:06.916 --> 34:09.250
LIVE, ROSE, AND DODD

34:36.791 --> 34:40.625
And now, Arvid's daughter, Live,
would like to say a few words.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.083
Live.

35:02.166 --> 35:03.000
I…

35:05.500 --> 35:06.333
"Dad…"

35:11.041 --> 35:12.125
"Dear Dad…"

35:20.666 --> 35:25.541
"You were never a very sentimental man."

35:25.625 --> 35:29.041
"You were never a very sentimental man."

35:38.166 --> 35:41.208
-"I remember when we were little…"
-I need blood.

35:41.291 --> 35:42.375
Need blood.

35:43.708 --> 35:44.958
I can't take it.

35:48.666 --> 35:50.166
I need blood.

35:51.041 --> 35:53.166
-"I remember when…"
-I need blood.

35:54.333 --> 35:55.333
I just have to…

36:02.625 --> 36:04.416
Live, wait…

36:19.583 --> 36:21.666
Live! Wait!

36:24.250 --> 36:25.125
Wait!

36:43.583 --> 36:48.500
"I remember being quite small
and asking why you did this job."

36:50.500 --> 36:52.000
"I told you I could never do it."

36:53.333 --> 36:54.833
"I couldn't do it…"

36:55.375 --> 36:58.250
"I couldn't do it
because of all those left behind."

37:00.458 --> 37:02.500
"Those left behind with all that grief."

37:18.958 --> 37:19.791
Hey…

37:33.125 --> 37:34.875
I thought the ceremony was nice.

37:35.541 --> 37:36.375
Dodd.

37:44.708 --> 37:46.250
Have you heard from Live?

37:47.166 --> 37:48.166
No.

38:18.958 --> 38:19.791
No.

38:20.416 --> 38:21.875
INCOMING CALL - REINERT

38:21.958 --> 38:24.250
13 MISSED CALLS - REINERT
5 MISSED CALLS - ODD

38:31.541 --> 38:34.000
Hi, Live. It's Reinert.
Can you call me back?

38:34.625 --> 38:36.583
Hi, Live. It's Reinert.

38:36.666 --> 38:39.333
Hi, it's Reinert.
Where are you? I'm trying to reach you.

38:39.416 --> 38:41.333
Live, what's going on?

38:41.416 --> 38:42.833
Live, please.

38:42.916 --> 38:46.166
What's going on with you?
I'm worried about you. Let me…

38:47.041 --> 38:48.750
I want to help you, okay?

38:53.416 --> 38:56.375
You ran from the church so fast.
What happened? Did you talk to her?

38:56.458 --> 39:00.583
I couldn't catch up with her. It was…

39:00.666 --> 39:03.833
No, running isn't your strong suit.
That stamina of yours.

39:03.916 --> 39:07.958
Right, my stamina. Join me next time
and you won't be coming home.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.916
-You don't think I will?
-No.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.458
You can keep the lactic acid
and the taste of blood.

39:12.541 --> 39:14.166
-My dinner's ready now.
-Okay.

39:14.708 --> 39:16.250
-See you tomorrow.
-Fish au gratin.

39:16.333 --> 39:17.375
Okay, bye.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.916
I've been trying to reach you for a while.

39:49.333 --> 39:50.666
I think I'm just tired.

39:56.916 --> 39:57.750
Hey…

42:29.916 --> 42:33.958
