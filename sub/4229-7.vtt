He's looking for you,
Tom

00:02.033 --> 00:03.985
Previously on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:04.009 --> 00:05.639
We're gonna need
all the allies we can get.

00:05.663 --> 00:07.984
Those bastards aren't gonna quit
until they find us, again.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.051
You ever taken one down?

00:09.075 --> 00:10.248
I have.

00:10.390 --> 00:13.108
I am the only shot you got
to survive.

00:13.530 --> 00:15.172
Why would the Espheni
leave this place alone?

00:15.287 --> 00:17.381
How the hell
did this happen?

00:18.203 --> 00:19.656
Your daughter's
very special.

00:20.227 --> 00:22.520
shouldn't we give her the chance
to prove she's on our side --

00:22.544 --> 00:23.907
that she's still
one of us?

00:23.931 --> 00:25.619
Worst-case scenario,
what happens?

00:25.643 --> 00:26.745
Worst-case...

00:26.769 --> 00:28.288
She kills you all.

01:48.906 --> 01:52.508
Lexi?
Are you all right?

01:52.543 --> 01:54.877
Her eyes.

01:54.912 --> 01:57.980
What happened
to her eyes?

01:59.183 --> 02:01.951
Lexi?!
Lexi! Oh!

02:01.985 --> 02:05.087
Lexi?

02:05.122 --> 02:07.190
Honey?

02:07.257 --> 02:08.958
Lexi?

02:12.896 --> 02:14.397
Mom?

02:14.431 --> 02:17.533
I'm here.
We're both here.

02:17.568 --> 02:19.769
It's me.

02:19.803 --> 02:21.938
Tom Mason?

02:21.972 --> 02:23.139
You remember.

02:23.173 --> 02:25.374
I'm your father.

02:28.345 --> 02:30.313
Lexi!

02:34.751 --> 02:35.985
Is there anything
you need?

02:37.421 --> 02:39.922
We're so glad you're all right,
that you're back with us.

02:42.993 --> 02:44.260
I have to go.
Go, Lexi?

02:44.294 --> 02:45.995
No,
you can't go anywhere

02:46.029 --> 02:48.297
until I've had a chance to calm
everybody down out there.

02:48.365 --> 02:51.501
I could hear them.
Their fear, their hatred.

02:51.535 --> 02:53.903
They wanted to hurt me.
No.

02:53.937 --> 02:55.738
We didn't know what was
going on in there.

02:55.772 --> 02:58.274
People were afraid that you
were gonna come out...

02:58.308 --> 02:59.876
different, dangerous.

02:59.910 --> 03:01.544
The faithful never believed
that, not for a second.

03:01.578 --> 03:03.045
I am different.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.480
I tried to help those
who lived here

03:04.481 --> 03:06.349
to make peace
with their enemies,

03:06.383 --> 03:08.150
but I see now
there's no use.

03:08.185 --> 03:11.287
Humans cannot let go
of their warlike ways.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.456
So it's time for me
to leave here.

03:13.490 --> 03:15.858
I don't understand.

03:15.893 --> 03:18.227
You spoke to me
when you were in the cocoon.

03:18.262 --> 03:20.229
You said you would
always need your family.

03:20.264 --> 03:23.499
You misunderstood.
Not this family.

03:25.135 --> 03:27.103
Your hearts are filled
with violence.

03:27.137 --> 03:28.838
I try to show you
another path,

03:28.872 --> 03:31.774
but you don't have
the courage to change.

03:31.808 --> 03:33.943
There's nothing more
I can do.

03:33.977 --> 03:35.411
For any of you.

03:35.445 --> 03:37.113
Wait, please.

03:37.180 --> 03:41.117
Lexi...I never gave up
on the dream.

03:41.184 --> 03:44.320
For that, I will always be
grateful to you, Lourdes.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.522
Lexi, you're right.
They are afraid of you.

03:46.557 --> 03:48.190
They may try to hurt you.
Let them try.

03:49.993 --> 03:51.260
Lexi.
Lexi.

03:55.399 --> 03:58.935
Lexi, wait!

03:58.969 --> 04:00.436
Lexi!

04:01.838 --> 04:04.807
Don't take another step.
I mean it.

04:04.841 --> 04:06.809
Pope, trust me.
Don't do it.

04:06.843 --> 04:08.511
If she wanted to hurt us,
she would have done it by now.

04:08.545 --> 04:11.414
At every step, you people
respond with violence.

04:11.448 --> 04:13.015
You Masons
are always so damn eager

04:13.050 --> 04:14.450
to make excuses
for one of your own.

04:14.451 --> 04:16.786
I'm leaving.
Don't try to stop me.

04:16.853 --> 04:20.322
Lexi, wait.
Please, take me with you.

04:20.357 --> 04:23.259
Before I met you,
I'd lost everything.

04:23.293 --> 04:25.127
I-I didn't know
who I was anymore,

04:25.162 --> 04:27.863
and you saved me.

04:27.898 --> 04:29.899
You're in so much pain.

04:29.933 --> 04:31.000
These last few months,

04:31.034 --> 04:32.969
you've given me a reason
to go on.

04:33.003 --> 04:36.439
Without you,
I can't...

04:36.473 --> 04:40.176
I won't.
I'm afraid.

04:40.243 --> 04:42.712
Poor Lourdes.

04:42.779 --> 04:44.981
Would you like me
to set you free?

04:45.015 --> 04:46.849
Oh, thank you, Lexi.

04:46.883 --> 04:49.085
You know I'll always
be beside you.

04:49.119 --> 04:52.221
Yes. Always in my heart,
Lourdes.

04:55.292 --> 04:57.426
Breathe deeply.

05:02.532 --> 05:06.235
Wait. What are you --
what are you doing?

05:06.269 --> 05:07.370
Don't be scared.

05:07.404 --> 05:09.905
Lexi! Lexi, stop it!
Lexi!

05:14.811 --> 05:17.146
I'm not doing this!

05:17.180 --> 05:18.481
Just let go.

05:18.515 --> 05:21.784
I'm not ready.

05:21.818 --> 05:23.185
You're free.

05:27.290 --> 05:30.359
Somebody take a shot!
Aah!

05:31.061 --> 05:33.462
- Lourdes! Lourdes!
- Lourdes!

05:33.497 --> 05:35.865
Where did she go?!

05:45.308 --> 05:47.176
She's gone.

05:51.046 --> 05:55.046

06:29.412 --> 06:32.447
It's not fair.

06:32.515 --> 06:35.817
She was so young.

06:35.851 --> 06:38.486
She was just
a frightened med student

06:38.554 --> 06:40.955
when she came to work
with me.

06:43.793 --> 06:49.497
But she became so much more
than just a friend.

06:49.532 --> 06:53.368
She was my kid sister.

06:53.402 --> 06:54.869
And I loved her.

07:01.677 --> 07:04.512
Goodbye, Lourdes.

07:08.517 --> 07:10.618
I'm so sorry, Hal.

07:10.653 --> 07:15.924
Yeah, well, I think it might be
a little late for that, Dad.

07:15.958 --> 07:18.927
I tried to warn you,
and you wouldn't listen.

07:18.961 --> 07:21.596
'Cause she's a Mason.

07:21.630 --> 07:25.100
She a Mason now?
Lexi still family?!

07:25.167 --> 07:27.435
Yes, she is.

07:27.470 --> 07:32.407
Well, that's a problem,
isn't it?

07:38.748 --> 07:41.049
I'm sorry.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.650
He's wrong.

07:42.718 --> 07:46.388
He's not wrong.
I made a promise to everybody.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.990
That if Lexi came out dangerous,
I would deal with it.

07:52.061 --> 07:54.529
But I am so...

07:54.597 --> 07:56.064
conditioned to protect
and defend

07:56.098 --> 07:57.766
and rationalize
and excuse by rote.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.735
It's...It's poisonous,

08:00.803 --> 08:03.071
because regardless of the fact
that I love her,

08:03.105 --> 08:05.006
we need to look at this, Anne,
right now.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.509
How could she do it?

08:07.576 --> 08:08.710
I don't know.

08:08.744 --> 08:11.045
Did you see her face?

08:11.080 --> 08:12.814
Lourdes was begging
for her life,

08:12.882 --> 08:14.949
and it looks almost as if
she's enjoying it.

08:14.984 --> 08:16.518
Oh, stop.
I'm not gonna stop!

08:16.552 --> 08:17.786
This is our daughter!

08:19.121 --> 08:21.689
Those monsters,
they took control of her,

08:21.724 --> 08:22.791
they're to blame.

08:22.825 --> 08:26.461
Lexi didn't do that!
You know it!

08:28.130 --> 08:31.032
And it is because
we love her

08:31.066 --> 08:34.803
that we are the only ones
that can save her, Tom!

08:37.440 --> 08:39.774
Please.

08:42.945 --> 08:45.947
I hope you're right.

08:48.017 --> 08:50.051
I love you.

08:50.085 --> 08:52.020
I love you, too.

08:58.794 --> 09:02.063
I just...I need you
to make me a promise.

09:03.966 --> 09:06.901
Just don't quit on us.

09:06.969 --> 09:08.803
I'm not gonna quit.

09:10.339 --> 09:12.507
Couldn't if I tried.

09:12.541 --> 09:14.509
This equipment
is not  capable

09:14.543 --> 09:16.344
of that kind of analysis.

09:16.378 --> 09:17.779
All I can confirm

09:17.813 --> 09:19.447
is that Lexi has gone through
a transformation.

09:19.482 --> 09:21.616
Is there any sign that
she's being controlled,

09:21.650 --> 09:24.018
the way the Espheni do with
the harnesses or the eye worms?

09:24.053 --> 09:27.021
This cocoon is like nothing
we've ever encountered,

09:27.089 --> 09:28.790
and  Espheni biotech

09:28.824 --> 09:31.759
is still far beyond
our capacity to understand.

09:31.827 --> 09:33.328
We'd settle for a theory.

09:33.362 --> 09:36.698
Come on. We're grasping
at straws here.

09:36.732 --> 09:39.033
Well, I believe that Lexi has
changed at the cellular level.

09:39.068 --> 09:42.070
Her human and Espheni
DNA strands have conjoined

09:42.104 --> 09:46.074
and become something new
and altogether different.

09:46.108 --> 09:48.042
It doesn't explain her
becoming an evil thing

09:48.110 --> 09:49.978
capable of killing Lourdes.

09:50.012 --> 09:52.480
Lexi isn't evil.
I don't accept that.

09:52.515 --> 09:53.681
Well, I don't accept it,
either. I don't...

09:53.716 --> 09:55.483
I don't want to.

09:55.518 --> 09:58.620
I've come to know your daughter
these past few months,

09:58.687 --> 10:01.489
and I've come to care for her.

10:01.524 --> 10:04.759
It pains me to think that she
lost touch with her humanity.

10:04.793 --> 10:06.728
She didn't.

10:06.762 --> 10:08.062
If she did, then it makes
the situation far --

10:08.097 --> 10:09.597
You didn't hear me.

10:09.665 --> 10:12.534
I said she didn't lose touch
with her humanity.

10:12.601 --> 10:15.436
She is in there, Roger.
Help us.

10:17.540 --> 10:20.508
There's no
definitive proof.

10:20.543 --> 10:24.345
No.
And it just...

10:24.380 --> 10:27.849
makes the situation
far more dangerous.

10:27.883 --> 10:29.851
What your daughter
did to Lourdes,

10:29.885 --> 10:31.419
how she did it...

10:31.453 --> 10:34.389
indicates she's mastering
her abilities.

10:34.423 --> 10:36.424
She's becoming
more powerful.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.927
And this could be only the tip
of the iceberg.

10:40.095 --> 10:41.763
We have a problem.

10:46.869 --> 10:48.069
What happened?

10:48.103 --> 10:49.571
Anthony was out
on security sweep.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.072
Apparently,
he was ambushed.

10:51.106 --> 10:53.074
My recon team and I found him
on our way back to camp.

10:53.108 --> 10:54.509
Who did this to you?

10:54.543 --> 10:55.843
The cockroaches.

10:55.911 --> 10:58.546
I was with Bennett.
They burned him alive.

10:58.581 --> 11:00.348
Where did this happen?

11:00.382 --> 11:02.784
Just across the bridge
on the other side of the river.

11:02.851 --> 11:05.119
The skitters were on us
before we could react.

11:05.154 --> 11:07.655
They took us
to their Overlord.

11:07.690 --> 11:09.657
What do you mean they burned
him alive, Anthony?

11:09.692 --> 11:11.826
Overlord
ordered the skitters

11:11.860 --> 11:13.628
to hit him with some kind
of flame jet.

11:13.662 --> 11:15.530
I can still hear his screams.

11:15.564 --> 11:17.832
And that bastard,
he just watched.

11:17.866 --> 11:21.169
His face was all messed up,
like he'd been burned, too.

11:21.203 --> 11:23.871
The Overlord from the ghetto --
the one you torched --

11:23.906 --> 11:25.907
he's finally
tracked us down.

11:25.941 --> 11:28.576
This is why I have returned,
Tom Mason.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.446
Our recon drones alerted us
to a large Espheni force

11:31.480 --> 11:33.514
gathering just across the river
to the north.

11:33.582 --> 11:34.882
Tell them
how you got away.

11:34.917 --> 11:36.718
They let me go,
and I don't know why.

11:36.752 --> 11:38.886
They're sending a message.

11:38.921 --> 11:40.388
When you were the ghost,
you had that son of a bitch

11:40.422 --> 11:41.723
chasing his tail
all over the ghetto.

11:41.790 --> 11:42.957
And now
that Lexi's gone,

11:42.992 --> 11:44.926
there's no reason for him
to hold back.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.060
So I suggest we bug the hell
out of here

11:46.095 --> 11:47.662
before they send
those Beamers in

11:47.696 --> 11:48.830
and blow us right off
the face of the map.

11:48.864 --> 11:50.398
If he was gonna
send Beamers in,

11:50.432 --> 11:52.567
we'd be having this conversation
in a crater.

11:52.601 --> 11:55.570
This is about payback.
This is personal.

11:55.604 --> 11:58.439
It's gonna
be a ground game.

11:58.474 --> 12:01.809
Okay.
We could use that.

12:03.479 --> 12:05.680
If this invasion is as imminent
as you say it is,

12:16.244 --> 12:19.335
Here are the current Espheni
positions only a few miles away.

12:20.484 --> 12:23.407
Well, looks like
your crispy Overlord there

12:23.408 --> 12:25.843
came loaded for bear.

12:25.877 --> 12:27.344
I count
three mech battalions

12:27.378 --> 12:29.313
and at least
five skitter platoons.

12:29.347 --> 12:31.582
They're right on top of us.
They could attack anytime.

12:31.649 --> 12:33.569
Yes, they could be here
within a matter of hours.

12:33.585 --> 12:35.152
Not if we took out
this bridge.

12:35.186 --> 12:36.620
We cut off their approach
and force them to march

12:36.654 --> 12:39.123
20 miles to the south
across to the interstate.

12:39.157 --> 12:41.391
My team and I have enough
explosive charges to accomplish that.

12:41.426 --> 12:43.393
That give us enough time
to make a run for it?

12:43.428 --> 12:44.661
We're not running.

12:44.696 --> 12:46.196
This guy,
he's not gonna rest

12:46.264 --> 12:48.398
until he's wiped us off the face
of the earth.

12:48.466 --> 12:50.134
Our best chance is to take
a stand right here.

12:50.168 --> 12:52.770
This is your bread and butter,
Dan. Call the play.

12:52.837 --> 12:54.605
If we take out that bridge,

12:54.672 --> 12:56.607
we're gonna be forcing the enemy
to come at us the way we want.

12:56.674 --> 12:59.309
Remember Stalingrad. Cities are
the graveyards of armies.

12:59.344 --> 13:00.644
The approach from the south

13:00.712 --> 13:03.514
is right through
what's left of Chinatown.

13:03.548 --> 13:04.782
My men and I
will move immediately

13:04.816 --> 13:06.784
to take out that bridge.
Thank you, Cochise.

13:06.818 --> 13:08.786
Let's go up and take a look
at our cards

13:08.820 --> 13:11.155
before we decide
how to play them.

13:15.727 --> 13:18.262
They'll be coming
from the south.

13:18.296 --> 13:21.165
We'll turn this street
into a kill zone!

13:21.199 --> 13:22.499
Funnel them right in here.

13:22.534 --> 13:24.535
Cochise's mission
should buy us about 12 hours

13:24.569 --> 13:26.870
to get our defenses in line.
We could use all this.

13:26.905 --> 13:29.673
Rebar, the concrete,
vehicles for barricades,

13:29.707 --> 13:31.341
anything we can scavenge.

13:31.409 --> 13:33.677
Put smoke pots up and down
both sides of the street,

13:33.711 --> 13:37.147
reduce their sight lines,
limit their ability to see us.

13:37.182 --> 13:38.816
We could set positions on either
one of these sides right here,

13:38.850 --> 13:41.285
get them caught
in the crossfire.

13:41.319 --> 13:42.619
Once that burnt bastard
fights his way in --

13:42.654 --> 13:44.221
He won't be able
to get out.

13:44.255 --> 13:46.390
If we had any explosives,
we could mine the street.

13:46.424 --> 13:48.525
I have a better idea.
We mine the sky.

13:48.593 --> 13:50.861
Rain thermite down
on their heads.

13:50.895 --> 13:53.230
Since when do you know how
to make thermite, Dr. Glass?

13:53.264 --> 13:55.232
All you need
is aluminum, rust,

13:55.266 --> 13:57.568
and lots of love,
Professor Mason.

13:57.602 --> 13:59.269
Cochise and his team
can take out that bridge,

13:59.304 --> 14:00.671
we might have a shot at this.

14:00.705 --> 14:02.585
We'll get a shot.
We just have to make it count.

14:02.607 --> 14:04.708
All right, so we need
aluminum cans for the thermite,

14:04.742 --> 14:08.579
rubber tires, roof tar,
any gas we have left for smoke.

14:08.613 --> 14:10.214
Smoke is gonna be key.

14:10.248 --> 14:12.216
Lot to do,
not a lot of time.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.551
Dingaan,
feeling brave today?

14:14.586 --> 14:17.221
No less than yesterday.
No more than tomorrow.

14:17.288 --> 14:18.555
We're gonna need somebody
as lookout

14:18.590 --> 14:19.790
on the far end
of the kill zone --

14:19.858 --> 14:21.358
somebody let us know
when the enemy's near.

14:21.392 --> 14:22.593
I take it
I'm volunteering?

14:22.627 --> 14:24.228
You can take it
any way you want.

14:24.262 --> 14:25.902
Just find a warm body,
hoof it over there,

14:25.930 --> 14:27.364
use this to stay
in contact.

14:27.398 --> 14:29.766
Hey.

14:29.801 --> 14:32.302
Care to stick your ass
into the breeze with me?

14:32.337 --> 14:33.604
Thought
you'd never ask.

14:38.576 --> 14:40.244
Is that one ready?

14:40.311 --> 14:42.579
Yeah, go ahead.
Pour away.

14:42.614 --> 14:45.482
I tell you,
it has been a long time

14:45.516 --> 14:48.452
since I have smoked me
some skitter.

14:48.486 --> 14:50.087
There's nothing like
the sound

14:50.121 --> 14:51.822
of them catching a round
in the head.

14:51.856 --> 14:54.491
It's like somewhere between
popping a balloon

14:54.525 --> 14:56.860
and dropping a watermelon
off a freeway overpass.

14:56.895 --> 14:58.362
There's
nothing like it.

14:58.429 --> 15:01.565
That good, huh?

15:01.599 --> 15:04.534
You know...

15:04.569 --> 15:07.237
This gas could get us
halfway to the Keys.

15:07.272 --> 15:10.374
It's a shame to waste it.
Yeah, well,

15:10.408 --> 15:14.144
it'll also keep
these smoke pots burning.

15:14.178 --> 15:15.779
I don't know.

15:15.813 --> 15:17.648
I can look pretty smoking
in cutoff jeans and flip-flops.

15:17.682 --> 15:19.483
And, you know,

15:19.517 --> 15:20.717
you could get one of these
wrecks here up and running.

15:20.752 --> 15:22.286
I thought
you were the one

15:22.353 --> 15:25.322
who was all gung ho
about joining the 2nd Mass.

15:25.356 --> 15:26.823
That was before
I realized

15:26.858 --> 15:29.526
that Tom Mason had an alien
faith killer for a daughter.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.194
Welcome
to the fun house.

15:31.229 --> 15:33.063
I'm just saying, maybe we should
explore some alternatives.

15:33.097 --> 15:34.865
We?
I may be a lot of things,

15:34.899 --> 15:36.667
but I am not the type
to run for the hills.

15:36.701 --> 15:38.101
No hills in Florida.

15:38.136 --> 15:39.803
It's just alligators
and Epcot Center.

15:39.837 --> 15:41.838
You'd never make it
out of here, darling.

15:41.873 --> 15:44.207
The Masons, they may have
their shortcomings,

15:44.242 --> 15:47.277
but somehow they've managed
to live to fight another day.

15:47.312 --> 15:50.747
You, you want to survive,
you stick with them.

15:50.782 --> 15:52.282
I don't believe it.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.785
All I've heard you do
ever since we joined back

15:54.819 --> 15:56.787
with the 2nd Mass
is bitch and moan.

15:56.821 --> 15:59.723
But when push
comes to shove,

15:59.757 --> 16:01.725
you really care
about these people.

16:01.759 --> 16:05.162
The only thing
that I care...

16:07.565 --> 16:10.367
...about...

16:10.435 --> 16:12.536
is killing aliens.

16:12.570 --> 16:18.241
And we are about to have
the mother of all clambakes.

16:18.309 --> 16:22.546
And I, for one,
am not going to miss it.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.414
Okay, badass.

16:26.818 --> 16:29.653
Let the good times
roll.

16:37.395 --> 16:39.196
Hey, you strapped?

16:39.230 --> 16:40.364
Got some 5-5-6.

16:40.431 --> 16:41.598
Oh, no, thanks,
little man.

16:41.632 --> 16:42.833
I'm all set.

16:42.867 --> 16:45.335
Looks like you found
a museum piece.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.471
I liberated this
from an antique store.

16:47.538 --> 16:49.639
This baby can throw
a .50-caliber bullet

16:49.674 --> 16:50.674
over 1,000 yards.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.109
After the Civil War,

16:52.143 --> 16:53.677
folks used these
to take down buffalo.

16:53.745 --> 16:55.345
Never figured you
a history buff.

16:55.413 --> 16:56.880
Oh, yeah --
I'm gonna teach my own course,

16:56.914 --> 16:58.215
specially for skitters.

17:01.519 --> 17:03.387
That's Cochise
blowing the bridge.

17:03.454 --> 17:05.122
Giving us
a fighting chance.

17:05.156 --> 17:06.423
Okay,
get the word out.

17:06.457 --> 17:07.590
Volm just bought us
the time we need.

17:07.657 --> 17:09.559
Let's not squander it.

17:09.594 --> 17:11.560
All right, people,
bridge is done! Let's move!

17:11.596 --> 17:13.262
How's it going?

17:13.330 --> 17:15.265
It's peachy.

17:15.333 --> 17:16.700
Set these thermite
charges right,

17:16.733 --> 17:20.704
the first wave of mechs
are gonna get a slag bath.

17:20.738 --> 17:22.705
Saved you the last
of the ammo.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.508
No, give it to someone else.
I don't need it.

17:24.541 --> 17:26.242
You're turning down
extra ammo?

17:26.310 --> 17:27.444
I'm on recon. Here.

17:27.478 --> 17:29.146
You can use it
more than I can.

17:31.149 --> 17:33.617
Well...Stay safe.

17:33.651 --> 17:35.485
Yeah, you too.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.620
Maggie.

17:36.654 --> 17:38.388
Ben.

17:38.423 --> 17:41.291
Good luck.

17:44.662 --> 17:47.798
I didn't hear anyone
send you on recon.

17:47.865 --> 17:50.333
They didn't.
I'm going after Lexi.

17:50.368 --> 17:53.703
Why?
We need you here.

17:53.738 --> 17:55.405
I know dad and Weaver
have a solid plan,

17:55.440 --> 17:57.407
but...we could lose a lot
of good people.

17:57.442 --> 17:59.743
Lexi can stop that.
I can...get through to her.

17:59.777 --> 18:01.244
She's still a Mason.

18:01.279 --> 18:03.713
I think you should
talk to dad about that.

18:03.781 --> 18:06.383
Not a word to anyone.
Promise.

18:06.417 --> 18:09.119
All right.

18:09.153 --> 18:10.253
Wish me luck.

18:10.288 --> 18:11.555
Okay.

18:19.983 --> 18:23.552
Mind if
I set up post here?

18:28.959 --> 18:30.760
For what it's worth,

18:30.794 --> 18:32.928
I don't think we can hold Lexi
personally responsible

18:32.963 --> 18:34.730
for what went down
last night.

18:34.765 --> 18:38.033
Responsibility's not the issue.
Okay. What is?

18:38.068 --> 18:40.002
Love.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.973
Espheni use it against us
all the time.

18:44.040 --> 18:48.477
Because we love,
we don't do what's necessary.

18:48.512 --> 18:51.981
We make excuses.
We forgive.

18:52.015 --> 18:54.683
We look the other way.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.920
Love destroys our judgment,
our ability to see clearly.

18:57.954 --> 19:01.624
So we're just supposed to stop
loving each other.

19:01.658 --> 19:05.628
We can't afford to be
sentimental.

19:05.662 --> 19:07.963
Somebody falls under
the influence of the Espheni,

19:07.998 --> 19:12.968
if...they get a bug...

19:13.003 --> 19:15.938
They need to be terminated
immediately.

19:16.006 --> 19:19.942
If I'd taken that attitude,
you wouldn't be here.

19:21.711 --> 19:24.814
And I wouldn't have handed
my sister over to Karen.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.884
Okay, so you're gonna
take that on, too?

19:28.919 --> 19:30.753
Everyone's death
is your fault?

19:30.821 --> 19:31.954
Come on, Hal.

19:33.557 --> 19:36.892
What happened to Lourdes
was awful.

19:36.927 --> 19:40.896
But she put herself
next to Lexi, not you.

19:40.931 --> 19:43.999
Hal, it's not love
we need to kill.

19:45.635 --> 19:47.469
It's them.

19:49.172 --> 19:52.575
Cochise taking out that
bridge worked like a charm.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.777
The Espheni forces
are looping south.

19:54.811 --> 19:56.979
Where do we stand
with our defenses?

19:57.013 --> 19:59.515
Hal and Maggie
got the kill zone locked down.

19:59.549 --> 20:01.717
Crossfire emplacements
are set.

20:01.751 --> 20:04.887
Pope and Sarah have got
smoke pots ready to be lit.

20:04.921 --> 20:06.155
I guess we're as ready
as we can be.

20:06.189 --> 20:07.556
I think we need
to move everybody back

20:07.591 --> 20:08.757
behind the main barricade.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.726
That's where we'll make
our last stand

20:10.760 --> 20:12.061
if it all goes sideways.

20:12.128 --> 20:16.065
Well, Dingaan and Denny
in the forward position

20:16.099 --> 20:18.968
ready to warn us
when the Espheni are near.

20:19.002 --> 20:21.937
I think we should
send men to scout.

20:22.005 --> 20:25.674
Yeah.
Go find your brother.

20:25.709 --> 20:28.811
Uh...Ben made me promise
not to tell you,

20:28.845 --> 20:30.145
but, uh...

20:31.815 --> 20:34.116
...he left to find Lexi.

20:34.150 --> 20:37.119
He thinks he can convince her
to come back and help us.

20:37.187 --> 20:39.822
I should have stopped him.

20:42.559 --> 20:45.261
No, once your brother
makes his mind up,

20:45.295 --> 20:47.062
there's no stopping him.

20:47.097 --> 20:48.764
He's his father's son.

20:49.866 --> 20:52.067
But he was right
about the skitter rebellion.

20:52.102 --> 20:54.570
Maybe he knows something
about Lexi we don't.

20:54.604 --> 20:56.805
Think she'll hurt him?

20:56.840 --> 21:00.509
No way.
Never gonna happen.

21:00.577 --> 21:04.513
The aliens did something
to my Jeanne's DNA, too, Matt.

21:04.581 --> 21:08.684
They turned her into a creature
that I could hardly recognize.

21:08.718 --> 21:12.087
But still,
it was something I saw,

21:12.122 --> 21:15.090
something I felt.

21:15.125 --> 21:18.794
They couldn't change
what was true inside her.

21:18.862 --> 21:21.664
She was still
my little girl.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.566
She knew I was family.

21:24.601 --> 21:27.202
They couldn't break
that thread.

21:27.270 --> 21:29.872
That same thread's still
in your sister. I know that.

21:29.906 --> 21:32.975
Thanks.

21:33.009 --> 21:34.643
Ah,
there's just no comparison.

21:34.678 --> 21:36.145
I wasn't comparing.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.847
I'm saying freestyle
<i>is</i> improvisation.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.016
I heard you,
but I disagree, huh?

21:41.051 --> 21:42.851
Jazz is improvisation.

21:42.886 --> 21:43.986
Anyone with a drum pad

21:44.020 --> 21:45.721
and a rhyming dictionary
can rap.

21:45.755 --> 21:47.723
Well, everyone's entitled
to their opinion, right?

21:47.757 --> 21:49.758
Except
people who are wrong.

21:49.793 --> 21:51.961
Well, I'd rather be wrong
than listen to jazz.

21:51.995 --> 21:53.629
What planet
did you grow up on, huh?

21:53.663 --> 21:54.797
Brooklyn.

21:54.864 --> 21:56.899
That explains a lot.

21:56.933 --> 21:58.100
Whoa.

21:58.168 --> 21:59.168
What?

21:59.169 --> 22:00.169
Did you hear that?

22:00.170 --> 22:01.637
No. Nothing.

22:09.879 --> 22:12.848
There's so many.

22:12.882 --> 22:15.017
Too many.

22:15.051 --> 22:17.753
It's the Overlord.

22:18.521 --> 22:21.490
You know that saying
"It's darkest before the dawn"?

22:21.558 --> 22:22.691
Sure.

22:22.726 --> 22:24.593
Let's pray it's true.

22:24.661 --> 22:27.463
Let's get them burning
and go!

22:27.497 --> 22:31.133
This entire area is about
to become combat central!

22:31.167 --> 22:33.002
Yeah, all except
for the fallout shelter.

22:33.069 --> 22:34.236
Shelter?

22:34.270 --> 22:35.904
Yeah, you didn't
notice that room

22:35.939 --> 22:37.906
the brain trust keeps
meeting in used to be one?

22:37.941 --> 22:40.609
Would be a great place
to wait out this crap storm.

22:40.643 --> 22:43.979
Like I said, it's about to
become open season on skitters.

22:44.047 --> 22:45.981
I'm not going anywhere.
You're gonna love it.

22:46.049 --> 22:47.182
Okay.

22:47.217 --> 22:48.717
You know what I said

22:48.785 --> 22:51.520
about living each day
like it was my last?

22:51.554 --> 22:53.989
I really don't want today
to be that day.

22:54.024 --> 22:56.692
Don't think that. It's gonna be
fine. You're gonna be great.

22:56.726 --> 22:58.494
I'll get you through it,
all right?

23:06.136 --> 23:10.072
What are you people doing?!
Get back behind the barricade!

23:10.106 --> 23:13.776
Get -- the Espheni are
on the attack! Come on!

23:13.843 --> 23:16.111
When they see that we mean
no harm, we will be spared.

23:16.146 --> 23:18.647
Like hell you will! Now go!
Come on!

23:18.681 --> 23:20.849
Come on!
Hurry!

23:20.884 --> 23:23.185
Go!
Dingaan, come on!

23:25.755 --> 23:27.022
Dingaan.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.123
No!

23:28.158 --> 23:29.458
Come on!

23:29.492 --> 23:32.661
No!
No!

23:32.695 --> 23:33.629
Come on!

23:33.663 --> 23:36.732
No! No!

23:43.867 --> 23:46.202
Hold your fire!
Don't shoot!

23:46.236 --> 23:48.037
There are people
back there!

23:48.072 --> 23:50.039
Who? Everybody
not in the kill zone's

23:50.074 --> 23:51.507
supposed to be
behind the barricade!

23:51.542 --> 23:52.675
A group
of Lexi's followers!

23:52.743 --> 23:54.010
We have to go back
and get them!

23:54.044 --> 23:55.778
They're gone, Dingaan!

23:55.846 --> 23:58.114
There's nothing we can do.
Get over here. Get over here!

23:58.148 --> 24:00.116
Get down!

24:14.031 --> 24:15.631
All right,
here they come.

24:35.586 --> 24:38.121
Now.

24:38.155 --> 24:42.558
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

25:06.116 --> 25:09.152
Burn, baby, burn.

25:09.186 --> 25:11.687
Get down!

25:15.025 --> 25:18.528
Fall back. Fall back.
Fall back.

25:18.562 --> 25:21.063
I'll catch up!

25:27.070 --> 25:29.539
How am I doing?!
Doing great!

25:29.606 --> 25:32.442
Next time,
try with your eyes open!

25:44.822 --> 25:45.955
You're welcome.

25:45.989 --> 25:48.157
Hold your fire!
Oh, geez.

25:51.962 --> 25:53.563
What's that smell?

25:53.597 --> 25:55.865
What? I love the smell
of dead skitter in the morning.

25:55.933 --> 25:57.700
Very original.

25:57.768 --> 25:59.101
That's gas.

25:59.136 --> 26:01.504
We got a busted gas line!

26:01.538 --> 26:04.841
Everybody out!
The gas main is gonna blow!

26:04.908 --> 26:06.843
Sarah, go, or we're gonna go up
like a Viking funeral.

26:06.910 --> 26:10.046
Everybody out!
Out! Gas leak!

26:10.080 --> 26:14.016
I got your back!

26:47.184 --> 26:50.820
Sarah?!

26:50.854 --> 26:53.189
Sarah!

26:53.223 --> 26:54.490
God.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.492
You okay?
Sarah, you okay?

26:56.527 --> 26:59.195
You hit?
Are you hit?

27:02.199 --> 27:03.666
I'm sorry.

27:03.700 --> 27:07.770
It...just wasn't as much fun
as you promised.

27:07.804 --> 27:09.805
Hey.

27:16.547 --> 27:19.181
All these people just...

27:22.486 --> 27:25.421
It's okay.

27:25.489 --> 27:29.625
I don't want to fall apart
on you. I'm sorry.

27:29.693 --> 27:32.495
No, no, you are not
falling apart on me.

27:32.529 --> 27:35.097
Hey, you did great.

27:35.132 --> 27:37.633
You did fine.

27:51.748 --> 27:54.083
What the hell?

27:54.117 --> 27:56.619
What happened out here?

27:56.653 --> 27:58.788
Go see who needs help
over there.

27:58.822 --> 28:01.624
- Hal!
- Where's Maggie?

28:01.692 --> 28:03.526
Maggie!
Have you seen Maggie?!

28:03.560 --> 28:05.995
I told her to fall back right
before the whole street blew.

28:06.029 --> 28:07.897
What happened?
A gas line. The whole street went.

28:07.931 --> 28:09.432
Are you hurt?
No, no.

28:09.466 --> 28:11.067
I just --
I got something in my eye.

28:11.101 --> 28:13.803
Hey, help.
Easy! Easy! Easy! I got her.

28:13.837 --> 28:15.438
Maggie?!
Come on! Bring her over here!

28:15.472 --> 28:16.572
Bring her here,
bring her here.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.441
When it blew,
she dove in front of me.

28:18.508 --> 28:21.143
Sheltered me with her body.
We need to stop the bleeding.

28:21.178 --> 28:24.714
How --
how does it heal so fast?

28:24.748 --> 28:26.482
Spiked kids are tough.
Get her out of here.

28:26.550 --> 28:28.384
You had to go and ruin
my best pair of jeans?

28:28.418 --> 28:29.885
Come on.
Let's get her to the courtyard.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.487
Let's get all these wounded
to the courtyard.

28:31.521 --> 28:33.489
You got her? Up.
If there's any upside,

28:33.523 --> 28:36.125
a lot of skitters and mechs
got it, too.

28:36.159 --> 28:37.827
There will be more.
That Volm device said

28:37.894 --> 28:39.614
there are three battalions
across the river.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.597
This was the first. The next
will be here any minute.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.566
All right, we got to hurry.
We got to split up.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.667
Hal, come on! With me!

28:44.701 --> 28:46.168
Matt, you and me.
Okay.

28:46.203 --> 28:47.637
Wait, wait.

28:47.671 --> 28:50.172
Maggie?!
Hal! Hal!

28:50.207 --> 28:51.641
I just got to
tell you something.

28:51.675 --> 28:54.610
I just...

28:54.645 --> 28:56.946
I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

28:56.980 --> 28:58.414
I never
should have promised

28:58.448 --> 28:59.715
that I can protect everybody
from Lexi.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.584
This is on me.
It's -- it was on me.

29:01.652 --> 29:04.620
Nobody can be right
all the time, dad. I love you.

29:04.655 --> 29:05.921
Doesn't matter if you're right
or if you're wrong.

29:05.956 --> 29:06.989
I don't care.

29:07.024 --> 29:09.158
Maggie?!

29:09.192 --> 29:11.093
Tom!

29:11.161 --> 29:13.796
Everyone at the barricade got
the full brunt of the blast.

29:13.830 --> 29:15.898
They're all gone.

29:33.481 --> 29:35.015
What do you think
you're doing?

29:38.119 --> 29:39.686
I need your help.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.788
As soon as you left,
the Espheni surrounded us.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.624
Your father is consumed
with hatred for the Espheni.

29:44.659 --> 29:48.128
He dreams of killing them,
especially the one he burned.

29:48.196 --> 29:50.464
Now he'll get
his chance.

29:50.498 --> 29:51.765
And he'll die doing it,

29:51.833 --> 29:53.900
along with the rest
of your family.

29:53.935 --> 29:56.103
I offered them peace,
but they chose violence.

29:56.137 --> 29:59.506
You think you know them,
but you don't.

29:59.540 --> 30:01.908
Before the war,
dad never even held a gun.

30:01.943 --> 30:04.111
He never raised his hand
in violence.

30:04.145 --> 30:06.947
The same's true of Matt and Hal
and your mother.

30:07.014 --> 30:10.984
She...She was a doctor.
She healed people.

30:11.052 --> 30:14.888
You really do love them,
don't you?

30:16.958 --> 30:19.092
You have to go back.
We have to help them.

30:19.127 --> 30:20.427
Go back?

30:20.461 --> 30:22.963
No.
You've come this far.

30:24.665 --> 30:26.800
There must be a reason.

30:26.834 --> 30:28.935
Come with me, Ben.

30:47.088 --> 30:49.589
100 souls reduced to 30
in a matter of minutes.

30:49.624 --> 30:51.558
Less than 20
are able to fight.

30:51.626 --> 30:53.727
We were winning
until that gas main blew.

30:53.794 --> 30:55.028
Thought you said you had

30:55.096 --> 30:57.030
this French fry
where you wanted him, huh?

30:57.098 --> 30:58.465
So what's the plan now?

30:58.499 --> 30:59.900
We all just gonna
sit around here

30:59.934 --> 31:02.068
until the cockroaches nuke
our little vacation spot?

31:02.103 --> 31:03.570
Is that it?
He's not gonna nuke us. Not yet.

31:03.604 --> 31:04.905
He wants me alive.

31:04.939 --> 31:06.706
Well, here's an idea.

31:06.774 --> 31:08.608
Why don't you get out there
and take one for the team, huh?

31:08.643 --> 31:10.110
Because as soon
as he knows I'm dead,

31:10.144 --> 31:12.646
his Beamers are gonna bomb
this place flat!

31:12.680 --> 31:15.482
Oh, I'm sorry.
So what you're saying then

31:15.550 --> 31:17.651
is that this doesn't end
until we all are dead?

31:17.685 --> 31:21.154
Yes, Pope!
We all have to die!

31:21.222 --> 31:23.056
In 10 to 20 minutes,

31:23.090 --> 31:25.825
the next wave of Espheni are
gonna come marching in here,

31:25.860 --> 31:28.428
and we need to make them think
that we are all dead.

31:28.462 --> 31:29.896
We have to hide.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.831
We have to convince them
that when the gas main blew,

31:31.866 --> 31:35.168
it took us all out.

31:35.203 --> 31:37.704
The fallout shelter.

31:37.738 --> 31:39.005
If we're all down there,

31:39.040 --> 31:41.441
this place will look like
a ghost town.

31:41.509 --> 31:43.443
That's a good idea.

31:43.477 --> 31:46.947
We do one last sweep
for survivors.

31:47.014 --> 31:48.848
Everyone underground!

31:48.883 --> 31:51.218
Okay. Let's go.
10 minutes! Move out!

31:51.252 --> 31:52.786
We're evacuating.

31:52.853 --> 31:54.521
Keep moving out of the building
to the shelter.

31:54.555 --> 31:56.089
Let's go!
We got to move, Doc, now!

31:56.157 --> 31:58.091
I-I heard the order.
I've got to get Lexi's samples.

31:58.159 --> 31:59.859
We don't have time
for that.

31:59.894 --> 32:01.861
If I'm gonna be able to find out
what's happening to her,

32:01.896 --> 32:03.697
I'm gonna
have to study these.

32:03.731 --> 32:04.864
Doc.

32:04.932 --> 32:07.100
What?

32:15.142 --> 32:18.645
You'd think
that would hurt.

32:18.679 --> 32:21.014
Whoa, whoa.

32:21.048 --> 32:23.183
Let's go. Let's go.
Hey, Anne! Uh...

32:23.217 --> 32:24.484
Keep going, you guys.

32:24.518 --> 32:27.020
Go to the shelter.

32:38.766 --> 32:42.435
Roger?
You're gonna be okay.

32:45.573 --> 32:46.873
Is this it?

32:49.443 --> 32:51.945
Well,
I was a walking dead man

32:51.979 --> 32:54.014
when you found me anyway.

32:55.549 --> 32:58.151
Dr. Glass.
Lexi's samples.

32:58.185 --> 33:01.688
I wasn't able to save her.

33:01.756 --> 33:03.456
Maybe someone else can.

33:03.491 --> 33:04.624
Oh, Roger.

33:04.692 --> 33:05.792
Okay.

33:08.062 --> 33:09.162
Thank you.

33:09.196 --> 33:11.865
I never told you.

33:11.899 --> 33:16.803
Lexi...has the same-color eyes
as my daughter.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.974
Just tell her I wasn't able...

33:21.008 --> 33:25.779
To do more for her,
and I'm sorry.

33:31.552 --> 33:33.153
It's you, Tom.

33:33.220 --> 33:37.524
Don't you let her go again.
You find a way...

33:37.591 --> 33:39.526
And you...

33:39.593 --> 33:42.062
You bring her back.

33:52.773 --> 33:54.774
He's gonna pay for this.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.180
Come on.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.082
Everyone down there?

34:02.116 --> 34:05.618
Still waiting for Pope
and Sarah, Hal and Maggie.

34:05.653 --> 34:07.821
Don't worry.
They'll be here.

34:07.855 --> 34:09.989
Go on in.
Everybody go inside.

34:10.024 --> 34:11.958
I'm gonna put some debris
around this entrance.

34:11.992 --> 34:13.672
Whoa, hold up.
Where are you gonna be?

34:13.694 --> 34:15.661
I'm gonna be up there.

34:15.696 --> 34:17.130
What exactly are you
gonna be doing up there?

34:17.164 --> 34:18.965
I'm gonna send a message
to an old friend.

34:18.998 --> 34:20.967
We have a plan.
We always have a plan.

34:21.001 --> 34:22.835
There are people depending
on you, people who need you.

34:22.870 --> 34:24.637
There always are.

34:24.672 --> 34:26.473
But the Espheni
keep killing them

34:26.507 --> 34:28.675
right in front of me.

34:28.708 --> 34:30.710
Day after day, they keep
backing us into a corner,

34:30.777 --> 34:32.712
pushing us until we do things

34:32.780 --> 34:34.481
that we never thought
we would do.

34:39.053 --> 34:41.187
Want to know
what the plan is?

34:41.222 --> 34:42.789
The plan is I'm gonna
take this rifle

34:42.857 --> 34:44.657
and I'm gonna go up there
and I'm gonna kill him!

34:44.692 --> 34:47.827
All due respect,
Professor,

34:47.862 --> 34:49.661
but you ain't never gonna
make that shot.

34:49.697 --> 34:51.531
The Overlord doesn't come
within 400 yards.

34:51.565 --> 34:55.902
And that rifle of yours
can't hit crap past 300.

34:57.671 --> 34:59.506
Let me do it.

34:59.540 --> 35:03.910
This sharps has been dropping
folks at 700 yards since 1874.

35:03.944 --> 35:06.446
It has the reach. I got
the skills. This is what I do.

35:09.083 --> 35:12.085
Then you can teach me
how to use it.

35:12.119 --> 35:13.787
That's an order.

35:18.659 --> 35:21.728
It's between me and him.

35:21.796 --> 35:24.531
Everybody else
can take the night off.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.418
Cock it.

35:37.419 --> 35:38.552
Pull the back trigger,

35:38.620 --> 35:39.753
and that sets
the front trigger.

35:39.788 --> 35:42.489
Yep. All you got to do
is touch it.

35:44.459 --> 35:45.592
Hammer's supposed to fall,
right?

35:45.627 --> 35:47.194
Yeah, it's probably
got some crud

35:47.228 --> 35:48.429
in the action
from the fight.

35:48.496 --> 35:50.764
Here, give it.

35:53.701 --> 35:55.869
Yeah.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.574
Listen, Tom,
I may be way out of line here.

36:00.608 --> 36:04.445
But right now, you are way too
emotional to make this shot.

36:04.479 --> 36:07.748
You're right.
You're out of line.

36:07.782 --> 36:10.651
Okay.

36:10.685 --> 36:12.686
Well, I got to tear
this whole thing down.

36:12.720 --> 36:13.754
You know what?

36:13.788 --> 36:15.289
There was a can of oil

36:15.356 --> 36:17.458
in the closet downstairs
where I got them tools.

36:17.492 --> 36:18.992
I'll get it.
All right.

36:19.027 --> 36:21.295
I'm gonna have this thing
working slicker than eel crap.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.606
Dingaan!

36:32.640 --> 36:35.576
Hurry! Do you see anyone else
out there?!

36:35.643 --> 36:36.643
Alive?

36:36.644 --> 36:37.644
Saving the best for last.

36:37.645 --> 36:38.946
Okay, hurry! Hal!

36:38.980 --> 36:40.447
Is Maggie down
there already?

36:40.482 --> 36:41.748
I looked everywhere
for her.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.284
I just got here. She could be.
Get inside.

36:44.319 --> 36:46.153
Hey, you watch.
I'm gonna be right back.

36:46.187 --> 36:48.689
For as long as I can.

36:59.501 --> 37:00.834
Maggie?

37:07.342 --> 37:09.810
Hal.

37:09.844 --> 37:12.379
Has anybody seen Maggie?

37:18.353 --> 37:19.686
Got to get back out there.
No, no, no.

37:19.721 --> 37:20.854
Mechs are on top of us.

37:20.889 --> 37:22.322
Hal!

37:22.357 --> 37:23.624
I got to get Maggie!

37:23.658 --> 37:25.492
No, Hal.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.728
I'm sorry, soldier.
I'm sorry.

37:41.743 --> 37:45.412
It's the next wave.
They're here.

39:36.658 --> 39:38.659
Tick, tick. Boom.

39:55.610 --> 39:58.645
Did it work?
Do they think we're dead?

39:58.713 --> 40:01.715
We'll know soon enough,
son.

40:01.749 --> 40:04.818
Dad?

40:04.852 --> 40:09.256
He's gonna be okay.
Trust me.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.625
And you mark my words.

40:11.693 --> 40:13.327
We're gonna come out
of this hole swinging,

40:13.361 --> 40:15.662
and he's gonna be
waiting topside,

40:15.730 --> 40:19.966
another plan of action in that
stubborn old head of his.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.556
Tector.

41:49.590 --> 41:52.859
You stupid son of a bitch.
