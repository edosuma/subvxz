AKU: Long ago
in a distant land,

00:04.589 --> 00:09.093
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.385 --> 00:12.805
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.181 --> 00:18.436
But, a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.645 --> 00:21.314
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.528
Before the final blow
was struck,

00:26.611 --> 00:29.239
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.322 --> 00:33.868
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.081
Now, the fool seeks to return
to the past

00:38.414 --> 00:42.835
and undo the future that is Aku.
