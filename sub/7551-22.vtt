I call it "48-hour first line"

going to be working late.

- No.

The odd part was his tone.
It was anxious.

He said someone
was out to get him,

03:47.399 --> 03:48.999
and he needed to handle it.

someone might be?

one of his big business deals.

know what Sid was involved in?

I know. It's pathetic.

- So I've seen footage

05:48.817 --> 05:50.450
of your crime scenes,
and I have to ask...

05:50.485 --> 05:53.487
How do you fight crime
and keep your hair like that?

05:53.521 --> 05:55.555
And do it in high heels!

I assume you're here
about Sid's death.

05:58.359 --> 06:01.161
- How can I help?
- Well, uh, we checked with security,

06:01.195 --> 06:03.830
and I understand that
most employees enter and exit

06:03.864 --> 06:05.999
through the front door,
but apparently there's also

06:06.033 --> 06:07.567
- a private V.I.P entrance?
- That's right.

06:07.602 --> 06:09.403
Sid had it installed
for the actors

06:09.437 --> 06:11.672
so they could come and go
with more privacy.

06:11.706 --> 06:13.674
Are there any security cameras
on that private entrance?

06:13.708 --> 06:14.741
[Chuckles] They're actors,

06:14.776 --> 06:17.334
so they also use it
to do other things, like...

06:17.354 --> 06:19.578
Sid opted not to have
surveillance.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.415
So there's no way of telling
who came in or out

06:22.449 --> 06:24.317
- of the private entrance?
- I'm afraid not.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.819
Was anyone working here
last night

06:25.853 --> 06:27.753
between 11:00 P.M.
and 2:00 A.M.?

06:27.788 --> 06:30.023
- [Chuckles] Oh...
- Yes. All the writers and actors.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.657
Thursday is rewrite night.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.126
So most of them were here
until sunup.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.962
Of those people, did anyone
have a problem with Sid?

all of our rehearsals.

what I think of Sid?</i>

become more and more unstable.

07:19.171 --> 07:22.706
Mood swings, outbursts,
talks to himself...

07:22.741 --> 07:24.708
and to people who aren't there.

07:24.743 --> 07:26.543
But that was the first time
he ever went this far.

07:26.578 --> 07:28.545
Well, did he have a reason
to be angry with Sid?

07:28.580 --> 07:30.214
Aside from the lame sketch?

07:30.249 --> 07:33.650
Actually, yes. I talked to
Sid yesterday morning.

07:33.685 --> 07:35.753
He said he was planning
to fire Mickey.

07:35.787 --> 07:38.155
How can he fire his star?

07:38.190 --> 07:41.024
Ah... He's volatile,
unpredictable.

07:41.058 --> 07:43.193
He's become more and more
of a liability.

07:43.227 --> 07:46.497
Mr. Vogel, did Sid break
the news to Mickey last night?

07:46.531 --> 07:48.399
I don't know, but he might have.

07:48.433 --> 07:50.315
Well, Mickey wasn't
at the gathering for Sid.

07:50.335 --> 07:52.103
- Is he in the building?
- If he is,

07:52.137 --> 07:53.537
he'll be in the wardrobe
and props room.

07:53.572 --> 07:55.438
He hangs out there
to develop new characters.

07:57.842 --> 08:00.243
Hello? Anybody there?

08:00.277 --> 08:02.746
I'm really hoping Mickey's
not the one behind this.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.482
I mean, the man is just
so damn funny on the show,

[Grunting]

08:41.985 --> 08:43.686
Oh! My pancreas!

08:43.720 --> 08:46.321
[Laughing]

08:46.356 --> 08:50.159
You see what I'm saying?
Even arrested, he's hilarious!

08:50.193 --> 08:52.528
[Laughing] Mr. Franks.

08:52.562 --> 08:55.531
You're a comedic genius.
I'm a huge fan.

Mr. Franks.

09:08.379 --> 09:11.186
Please direct all your questions
to my personal attorney.

09:11.582 --> 09:12.682
[High-pitched voice] Mickey,

09:12.716 --> 09:14.383
don't say another word.

09:14.417 --> 09:17.487
I'm lead counsel for Mr. Franks.

09:23.508 --> 09:26.559
Uh, Mr. Franks, you made
some threats

09:26.579 --> 09:28.344
against Sid Ross last night.

09:28.364 --> 09:30.460
You're damn right I...
<i>don't answer that!</i>

09:31.438 --> 09:35.336
Detective, address your
questions to me, please.

09:35.371 --> 09:36.938
Thank you.

09:36.972 --> 09:38.006
Uh...

09:39.675 --> 09:41.667
Uh, where were...

09:42.978 --> 09:45.313
Where... was your client

09:45.347 --> 09:47.949
between 11:00 P.M.
and 2:00 A.M. last night?

09:47.983 --> 09:50.151
He was minding his own
damn business!

09:50.185 --> 09:52.120
My client is
an upstanding citizen

09:52.154 --> 09:53.288
and a pillar of the community.

09:53.322 --> 09:56.524
Not to mention, he's also
one funny mother-fudgesicle.

09:56.558 --> 09:59.109
[Normal voice]
Hey, watch your language.

09:59.341 --> 10:01.061
What happened, Mickey?

10:01.095 --> 10:02.630
Did Sid tell you you were fired,

10:02.664 --> 10:04.476
so you snapped and killed him?

10:04.708 --> 10:06.567
Hold on, what?

10:06.601 --> 10:08.889
Sid... Sid's dead?

10:10.952 --> 10:13.206
Whoa, hey, oh... oh, whoa, I...

10:13.620 --> 10:15.375
I didn't kill him.

10:15.410 --> 10:17.411
I noticed you're no long seeking
counsel from your attorney.

10:17.445 --> 10:19.879
Yeah, no, that's...
that's just an act.

10:19.914 --> 10:21.848
I mean... I'm not crazy.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.818
Just spent a year of my life
convincing people that I was.

10:24.852 --> 10:26.486
Yeah, and you've done
a pretty good job of it.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.188
I'm an actor, okay?
[Chuckles nervously]

10:28.222 --> 10:30.690
I am an actor that's tied to
a long-term contract

10:30.724 --> 10:34.260
that's, uh... not exactly
covering his expenses.

10:34.294 --> 10:36.228
Are you saying you were
<i>trying</i> to get fired?

10:36.263 --> 10:38.431
I mean, Sid controls my career.

10:38.466 --> 10:40.981
Because of him, I'm missing out
on major movie roles.

10:41.384 --> 10:42.902
That's why I attacked you guys.

10:42.937 --> 10:46.005
I figured maybe if you 5150 me
on a bellevue psych hold,

10:46.039 --> 10:47.674
he would finally cut me loose.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.241
Okay, look, crazy or not,

10:49.276 --> 10:51.710
you still made some pretty
serious threats against Sid,

10:51.744 --> 10:53.179
and hours later
he ended up dead.

10:53.213 --> 10:55.614
Okay... you're asking my
whereabouts, right?

10:55.648 --> 10:57.916
Okay, I was upstairs
at the rooftop bar

10:57.951 --> 10:59.551
getting wasted all night.

10:59.586 --> 11:02.388
And then I stumbled down
to the wardrobe and props room

11:02.422 --> 11:04.523
at about 3:00 A.M.
and passed out.

11:04.557 --> 11:06.892
I had just woken up
when you guys came in.

11:06.926 --> 11:09.060
Plus, I had no idea
Sid was even dead,

11:09.095 --> 11:10.665
so how could I have had
anything to do with it?

11:10.685 --> 11:12.046
Okay.

11:13.499 --> 11:15.133
Look, I might know who did!

11:15.795 --> 11:17.035
Okay.

11:17.362 --> 11:18.937
We're listening.

11:19.564 --> 11:21.106
Look, at around 9:00 P.M.
last night,

11:21.126 --> 11:23.608
I... did go to Sid's office

11:23.642 --> 11:25.743
to beg to be let out
of my contract.

11:25.777 --> 11:28.946
But I never went in because
I heard him on the phone.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.715
He was yelling at someone.

11:30.749 --> 11:33.051
- Who was he yelling at?
- I don't know.

11:33.085 --> 11:33.885
But it had something to do
with a deal

11:33.919 --> 11:35.453
that was going down
around midnight.

11:35.488 --> 11:37.555
Midnight? Did he say
what the deal was?

11:37.589 --> 11:39.657
No. But Sid told
that person on the phone

11:39.691 --> 11:42.233
they better stick to
the agreement, or else.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.131
Can I call my real attorney?

11:47.165 --> 11:48.966
The bartender confirmed
Mickey's alibi.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.601
He's not our killer.

11:50.636 --> 11:52.236
Well, then we can assume
Mickey was telling the truth

11:52.270 --> 11:54.304
about the phone call
he overheard Sid making.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.840
Yeah, but what kind of deal
would Sid be making at midnight?

11:56.874 --> 11:58.742
Whatever it was,
it went down in the middle

11:58.776 --> 11:59.743
of his time of death window.

11:59.777 --> 12:01.611
So this deal could be
connected to his death.

12:01.646 --> 12:04.148
We need to figure out who Sid
was talking on the phone with.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.749
Well, that's easier
said than done.

12:05.783 --> 12:07.017
I just got Sid's phone dump.

12:07.052 --> 12:08.652
That 9:00 P.M. phone call

12:08.686 --> 12:09.886
came from
an untraceable burner phone.

12:09.921 --> 12:12.255
You know what? Why don't we
get ahold of Sid's associates,

12:12.289 --> 12:14.157
see if any of them
know what this deal was.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.458
I know who exactly
who to start with.

12:15.492 --> 12:17.027
Right after that mystery call,

12:17.061 --> 12:19.128
Sid phoned none other
than Danny Valentine.

12:19.163 --> 12:22.098
If anyone knows about that deal,
it's Valentine.

12:22.132 --> 12:25.201
Detective, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:25.235 --> 12:27.870
Look, buddy, I'm a cop
and a model,

12:27.904 --> 12:29.972
so I know when someone's
lying to me.

12:30.006 --> 12:32.341
And when their outfit
is clashing.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.843
Now stand back!
This could be dangerous!

12:34.878 --> 12:37.046
Don't worry. My experience
writing crime novels

12:37.081 --> 12:39.115
has prepared me for danger.

12:39.149 --> 12:41.984
Plus, I have my vest.

12:44.253 --> 12:48.724
Look out, bad guys,
here we come!

12:48.758 --> 12:51.126
Uhh! Oh, model cop down!

12:51.160 --> 12:52.527
I broke a heel!

12:52.562 --> 12:53.796
- Ohh!
- Man: Scene!

12:53.830 --> 12:55.497
And scene! Great job, guys.

12:55.531 --> 12:57.199
Okay, well, I don't know
whether we should be

12:57.233 --> 12:58.533
flattered or offended.

12:58.568 --> 13:01.136
Who cares? Danny Valentine's
playing <i>me!</i>

13:01.170 --> 13:03.638
Well, what do you think?

13:03.672 --> 13:05.907
Um, about the sketch?
It's... uh, cute.

13:05.941 --> 13:07.476
Danny Valentine's playing me.

13:07.510 --> 13:08.543
Yeah. [Laughs]

13:08.578 --> 13:10.178
Speaking of Mr. Valentine,

13:10.213 --> 13:11.213
we need to talk to him.

13:11.247 --> 13:12.814
Oh. Uh, Danny?

13:13.782 --> 13:16.050
Danny: Aha! The real police.

13:16.085 --> 13:17.986
Here to give us some pointers?

13:18.020 --> 13:20.822
Mr. Valentine, Richard Castle.
I'm a big fan of...

13:20.856 --> 13:23.691
Yeah. What about you, detective?

13:23.726 --> 13:25.192
Are you a fan?

13:25.227 --> 13:27.161
[Chuckles nervously] Yeah...

13:27.195 --> 13:30.164
Uh, Mr. Valentine,
we need to... talk.

13:30.198 --> 13:33.334
Sure.
Let's go to my dressing room.

13:38.906 --> 13:41.375
Surely you've seen
some of my work...

13:41.409 --> 13:43.910
"Star Fleet"? "Family Practice"?

13:43.945 --> 13:45.779
My, uh, my car rental
commercials?

13:45.813 --> 13:49.250
Uh, yeah, well, I-I did
catch my fair share

13:49.284 --> 13:51.184
- of "Hot Suspect" reruns in college.
- Oh! [Laughs]

13:51.218 --> 13:53.720
I knew it!
The cop watched the cop show.

13:53.755 --> 13:55.421
Come on, I inspired you

13:55.456 --> 13:58.224
to become a detective,
didn't I? Huh?

13:58.259 --> 14:00.226
Maybe a little bit.
[Laughs]

14:00.261 --> 14:04.131
We're investigating
a murder, right?

14:04.165 --> 14:08.901
Right. Yeah. Uh, so...
We checked Sid's phone records,

14:08.935 --> 14:11.204
and apparently he called you
at 9:03 last night.

14:11.238 --> 14:12.539
Can you tell us why?

14:12.573 --> 14:14.240
Yeah, I was supposed
to have drinks

14:14.275 --> 14:16.108
with Sid and his ex, Evelyn.

14:16.143 --> 14:17.910
But Sid called last minute
to cancel.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.313
You and Sid were going out
with his ex-wife?

14:20.347 --> 14:23.149
- Isn't that a little odd?
- Not for us.

14:23.183 --> 14:25.151
Sid and Evelyn split
20 years ago,

14:25.185 --> 14:27.219
but we were all
still close friends.

14:27.253 --> 14:29.232
Did he say why he was canceling?

14:29.252 --> 14:31.223
Afraid not.

14:31.848 --> 14:34.226
Anything about
a deal at midnight?

14:34.260 --> 14:35.928
No, but he was going somewhere,

14:35.962 --> 14:37.663
because while we were
on the phone,

14:37.698 --> 14:39.764
I literally bumped into him
leaving the building

14:39.799 --> 14:41.633
from the private entrance.

14:41.668 --> 14:43.235
Wait, Sid was leaving
the building

14:43.269 --> 14:44.969
- the night of his murder?
- Mm-hmm.

14:45.004 --> 14:48.607
Uh, Mr. Valentine, did he
mention meeting with someone?

14:48.641 --> 14:51.566
Please. Call me Danny.

14:51.586 --> 14:54.048
And, no, Sid didn't
say where he was going.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.449
But I did see something strange.

14:58.483 --> 15:00.585
He went into the subway
on the corner.

15:00.619 --> 15:03.154
And why was that strange, Danny?

15:03.189 --> 15:05.489
Well, he had
an around-the-clock driver,

15:05.524 --> 15:08.693
so why would he take
mass transit?

15:08.728 --> 15:12.230
Unless it was
a secret rendezvous?

15:14.608 --> 15:16.334
[Elevator bell dings]

15:16.368 --> 15:18.202
Well, wherever Sid went,

15:18.237 --> 15:20.921
he obviously didn't want
anyone to know about it.

15:21.473 --> 15:23.274
Oh, come on, Castle.

15:23.309 --> 15:25.877
He was flirting with <i>me.</i>
<i>I can't control that.</i>

15:25.911 --> 15:27.078
But you were flirting
right back.

15:27.112 --> 15:28.713
Yeah, but what was I
supposed to do?

15:28.747 --> 15:31.281
He's Danny frickin' Valentine.
[Gasps]

15:31.316 --> 15:33.250
Espo, hey.

15:33.284 --> 15:34.952
You find out where Sid went
on that subway ride?

15:34.986 --> 15:37.921
Not yet, but I spoke to
Gene Vogel from Sid's company.

15:37.956 --> 15:39.557
The only deal
that he knew about was one

15:39.591 --> 15:40.924
that hasn't been officially
announced yet.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.460
Apparently Sid was gonna sell

15:42.494 --> 15:44.261
49% of his company
to an equity firm.

15:44.295 --> 15:45.896
Could that be the deal
Sid was talking about?

15:45.930 --> 15:47.064
Doesn't look like it.
The terms of the sale

15:47.098 --> 15:48.598
would have been settled
weeks ago.

15:48.632 --> 15:50.000
There was nothing left
to negotiate.

15:50.034 --> 15:52.601
Hey, guys, you're
gonna wanna see this.

15:54.438 --> 15:57.474
So, Sid paid
for his Metro card in cash,

15:57.508 --> 16:00.310
but I was able to use
security cams to track him

16:00.345 --> 16:02.812
all the way to Grand Army Plaza
subway station.

16:02.847 --> 16:05.147
He got off there at 11:30 P.M.

16:05.182 --> 16:07.016
In Brooklyn. What was he
doing in Brooklyn?

16:07.050 --> 16:08.351
You know, I wondered
the same thing,

16:08.386 --> 16:10.420
so I checked with
the 87th precinct.

16:10.454 --> 16:13.189
Apparently they responded
to a 9-1-1 call in that area.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.024
- About what?
- Well, check it out.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.959
Officers used
traffic cam footage,

16:16.994 --> 16:18.794
and they caught
the tail end of it.

16:18.828 --> 16:22.198
This is about a block away from
where Sid got off the subway.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.627
Now keep your eye on that
alley right there.

16:28.471 --> 16:31.307
- Were those gunshots?
- Fits with the 9-1-1 call.

16:31.341 --> 16:33.009
There was a report
of shots fired.

16:33.043 --> 16:35.277
Now watch what happens next.

16:35.311 --> 16:37.880
[Computer beeps]

16:37.914 --> 16:39.848
Beckett: That's Sid.

16:39.883 --> 16:41.650
You guys, look at the timestamp.

16:41.684 --> 16:43.318
It's from just after midnight.

16:43.352 --> 16:45.387
This must be the deal
he was talking about.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.056
And judging by the speed his
60-year-old legs are moving,

16:48.090 --> 16:50.216
I would say he's in danger.

16:52.861 --> 16:54.062
Who's that?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.063
I don't know, but he's got a gun

16:55.097 --> 16:57.065
and he's wearing a mask.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.368
And hours later, Sid gets
thrown down an elevator shaft.

17:00.403 --> 17:03.104
What the hell was Sid
mixed up in?

17:05.410 --> 17:06.611
You guys, is it just me,

17:06.645 --> 17:08.045
or does none of this make sense?

17:08.079 --> 17:09.613
I mean, Sid was
a multimillionaire.

17:09.646 --> 17:11.115
Guys like that don't make
shady deals

17:11.148 --> 17:12.770
in the middle of dark alleys.

17:12.790 --> 17:14.699
Or if you do, you have
someone else do it for you.

17:14.719 --> 17:16.487
Yeah, and take a look
at our suspect there.

17:16.521 --> 17:19.894
I mean, what is this, a deal
gone wrong or a failed hit?

17:19.914 --> 17:22.425
So what are we saying here,
that the masked man

17:22.460 --> 17:24.885
followed Sid back
to the "S.N.T." building and killed him?

17:24.905 --> 17:26.997
Well, with a private
entrance with no surveillance cameras,

17:27.031 --> 17:28.431
it's possible, right?

17:28.464 --> 17:29.966
But after an apparent
attempt on his life,

17:30.001 --> 17:32.335
why would Sid just go
back to the office?

17:32.369 --> 17:34.671
And if Sid really was in danger,
why didn't he call security?

17:34.705 --> 17:36.539
Well, we may find some
answers in that alley.

17:36.573 --> 17:37.607
Let's go check it out.

17:37.641 --> 17:39.542
Okay, Castle and I are gonna
scrub traffic cams.

17:39.576 --> 17:41.707
Maybe we'll find
the shooter there.

17:47.051 --> 17:48.284
[Siren wailing in distance]
Anything yet?

17:48.319 --> 17:49.852
No.

17:49.886 --> 17:54.023
No blood, no shell casings,
no nothing.

17:54.057 --> 17:56.459
Hey, doesn't this remind you
of, uh, that sketch

17:56.493 --> 17:59.728
from "Saturday Night Tonight"
where, uh, Mickey Franks

17:59.762 --> 18:02.131
plays Sherlock Holmes'
wacky cousin?

18:02.151 --> 18:04.722
No, I don't watch
that stupid show, bro.

18:04.742 --> 18:07.069
- You don't?
- No.

18:07.103 --> 18:08.737
Hell, no. The sketches
never have any endings.

18:08.771 --> 18:09.972
It's a big waste of time,

18:10.006 --> 18:11.506
just like searching
this alley is.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.475
You know, Javi, I think
that you need

18:13.509 --> 18:14.977
to find a way to be
more positive.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.411
No, I don't.

18:16.446 --> 18:18.547
And you need to stop saying
"no" all the time.

18:18.581 --> 18:22.050
Instead, why don't you try
saying "yes, <i>and..."?</i>

18:22.084 --> 18:23.752
What the hell are you
talking about?

18:23.786 --> 18:26.755
Oh, I learned it
in a "S.N.T." -sponsored

18:26.789 --> 18:28.890
improvisation class
I took in college.

18:28.924 --> 18:32.093
See, by simply substituting
"no" with "yes, <i>and..."</i>

18:32.127 --> 18:34.829
Partners can't deny
one another's progress

18:34.864 --> 18:37.598
moving forward in a scene
and accomplishing goals.

18:37.632 --> 18:39.200
[Wheels rattling]

18:39.235 --> 18:43.071
Yo. That guy might have
been here last night.

18:43.105 --> 18:45.039
Yes, <i>and</i> he might have
seen the exchange

18:45.074 --> 18:46.774
between Sid and the gunman.

18:46.808 --> 18:49.209
See what you can accomplish
by saying "yes, <i>and..."?</i> Hmm?

18:49.244 --> 18:51.579
Yes, <i>and</i> you need to
shut the hell up.

18:51.613 --> 18:53.042
Hey!

18:59.454 --> 19:01.589
Martha, you okay?

19:01.623 --> 19:05.792
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just a...
little tired, that's all.

19:05.826 --> 19:07.227
Shall we?

19:07.883 --> 19:09.062
Hey...

19:09.097 --> 19:10.797
[Whispering] Something's
wrong with your mom.

19:10.831 --> 19:12.699
[Whispering] I thought
we already covered that.

19:12.733 --> 19:13.867
No, no, no. She's not
repeating the lines.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.535
Something else is going on.

19:15.569 --> 19:18.305
Can't we just be happy
that she stopped?

19:18.339 --> 19:20.374
Castle, I have to go
to the precinct.

19:20.408 --> 19:22.776
Will you just talk to her
and meet me over there?

19:22.810 --> 19:25.077
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

19:25.112 --> 19:27.714
- [Loud voice] Bye, Martha.
- Bye, honey.

19:30.150 --> 19:31.618
[Normal voice] So...

19:31.652 --> 19:33.085
Previews tonight.
[Door closes]

19:33.120 --> 19:34.454
Pretty exciting, huh?

19:35.109 --> 19:37.338
Come on. "Is he dead?"

19:37.358 --> 19:38.891
[Chuckles] Wrong question.

19:38.926 --> 19:40.616
Am <i>I</i> dead?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.397
You know, I don't know
what I'm thinking.

19:44.431 --> 19:45.764
Eight performances a week,

19:45.799 --> 19:48.734
major play on Broadway.

19:48.768 --> 19:50.069
You've been on Broadway before.

19:50.103 --> 19:51.404
Well... [scoffs]

19:51.438 --> 19:53.239
Not since the Clinton
administration.

19:53.273 --> 19:55.774
And now it's all viral.

19:55.809 --> 19:57.643
Bloggers, tweeters.

19:57.677 --> 19:59.812
You know, people actually
come to the previews,

19:59.846 --> 20:01.647
record the show on their phone,

20:01.681 --> 20:04.450
put it online,
and make comments.

20:04.484 --> 20:07.486
And you don't feel
your performance is ready?

20:07.520 --> 20:08.520
Well, I just... I...

20:08.555 --> 20:10.288
I'm still honing my performance.

20:10.323 --> 20:12.023
That's what a... that's
what previews are for,

20:12.058 --> 20:14.420
and I just...

20:15.361 --> 20:16.861
[Exhales]

20:16.895 --> 20:19.399
I just don't want
to be humiliated.

20:19.865 --> 20:22.800
When I got this part,
I thought, well, hey,

20:22.835 --> 20:24.669
there's a chance, you know?

20:24.703 --> 20:26.838
This could be my second act.

20:26.872 --> 20:29.371
- It is.
- No, it isn't.

20:29.898 --> 20:32.097
It isn't. I'm not gonna
have a second act.

20:32.117 --> 20:33.931
I... [sighs]

20:34.195 --> 20:36.714
I think what I need to do
is just drop out,

20:36.748 --> 20:38.875
let my understudy take over.

20:38.895 --> 20:41.533
- She's very...
- Oh, absolutely not.

20:41.553 --> 20:44.355
You will not,
and do you know why?

20:44.389 --> 20:47.191
Because you're a fighter.
What have you always told me?

20:47.225 --> 20:50.627
No one will give you anything
in this life.

20:50.661 --> 20:52.496
You must earn it.

20:52.530 --> 20:54.198
And look at you.
Almost 20 years later,

20:54.232 --> 20:56.166
and you're back on Broadway?

20:56.201 --> 20:58.394
You have earned this.

21:00.538 --> 21:02.906
I have, haven't I?

21:02.940 --> 21:04.307
You have.

21:04.341 --> 21:06.676
Please don't let some idiot
with a cell phone

21:06.711 --> 21:09.412
take that away from you.

21:09.446 --> 21:10.881
Do you want me to come
to tonight's show,

21:10.915 --> 21:13.181
just for moral support?

21:13.879 --> 21:16.352
I want you to come
to the opening, kiddo,

21:16.387 --> 21:18.687
just like you always do.

21:18.722 --> 21:19.655
All right.

21:19.689 --> 21:21.824
But if I have to wait,
at least let me hear

21:21.858 --> 21:23.260
that sweet first line
one more time.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.761
Okay, um...

21:26.584 --> 21:27.763
Is he dead?

21:27.797 --> 21:30.033
But with feeling!
[Groans]

21:30.067 --> 21:31.667
[Exhales] Is he dead?

21:31.701 --> 21:33.602
One more for the cheap seats!

21:33.637 --> 21:35.103
Is he dead?!

21:35.138 --> 21:37.205
He's <i>so</i> dead!

21:37.240 --> 21:38.841
Ahh...

21:38.875 --> 21:41.043
And bow...

21:41.077 --> 21:42.545
[Elevator bell dings,
telephone ringing]

21:42.579 --> 21:44.547
Hey. So what'd you guys get
from the homeless man?

21:44.581 --> 21:46.114
Well, he didn't witness
the exchange between Sid

21:46.149 --> 21:47.516
and our masked gunman.

21:47.551 --> 21:49.184
However, he did hear
the gunshots

21:49.218 --> 21:51.853
and a few minutes later he saw
a black Explorer speeding away.

21:51.887 --> 21:54.388
- Did he get a plate?
- Yeah, the last four numbers,

21:54.423 --> 21:55.957
which got us a match
to an S.U.V.

21:55.991 --> 21:58.893
rented by this guy...

21:58.928 --> 22:00.562
Kurt van Zant.

22:00.596 --> 22:03.064
Just did a 35-year stretch
in folsom for drug trafficking,

22:03.098 --> 22:04.933
but he was just released.

22:04.967 --> 22:07.035
Is there a connection
between Sid and this ex-con?

22:07.069 --> 22:08.903
Oh, yeah.
Uh, while he was in prison,

22:08.938 --> 22:11.472
Van Zant filed a lawsuit
claiming that he financed

22:11.506 --> 22:12.906
the pilot for
"Saturday Night Tonight"

22:12.941 --> 22:14.775
and that Sid screwed him
out of all the profits.

22:14.809 --> 22:16.743
Wait a minute. You're telling me

22:16.778 --> 22:19.780
that a drug kingpin
bankrolled that comedy show?

22:19.814 --> 22:20.647
Yeah, I know. It sounds like

22:20.682 --> 22:21.782
one of their
comedy sketches, right?

22:21.816 --> 22:24.385
So a show that brought joy,
laughter, and "judge booty"

22:24.419 --> 22:27.454
to people everywhere may have
been built on drug money.

22:27.488 --> 22:28.755
Yeah, but the lawsuit
was thrown out,

22:28.790 --> 22:31.391
so while Sid was getting rich,
van Zant was rotting in prison.

22:31.425 --> 22:33.627
You know, maybe van Zant
was who Sid was talking about

22:33.661 --> 22:34.995
when he told his wife
someone was after him.

22:35.029 --> 22:36.930
Makes sense, right?

22:36.965 --> 22:38.966
If van Zant felt that Sid
owed him a share

22:39.000 --> 22:40.467
of the profits from the show,
maybe he came to collect.

22:40.501 --> 22:42.135
And when Sid didn't want
to go along,

22:42.169 --> 22:44.837
van Zant opted for revenge
instead.

22:44.871 --> 22:46.439
Where is van Zant now?

22:46.474 --> 22:48.007
He's registered at a hotel
up in Queens.

22:48.041 --> 22:51.111
Yo. I sent van Zant's
photo to security

22:51.145 --> 22:53.246
at "S.N.T.," asked if anybody
saw him last night.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.515
No one did. However,
30 minutes ago,

22:55.549 --> 22:56.583
van Zant entered the building

22:56.617 --> 22:59.090
on a day pass called in
from someone at the show.

23:00.346 --> 23:02.955
Kurt van Zant?
You got to be kidding me.

23:02.990 --> 23:04.356
Yeah. Do you know him?

23:04.390 --> 23:06.525
No, but Sid told me
all about him.

23:06.559 --> 23:07.927
He's dangerous.

23:07.961 --> 23:09.829
You're telling me he's here
in the studio?

23:09.863 --> 23:12.031
Do you know who called in
his pass?

23:12.065 --> 23:14.500
No, but I can find out.

23:14.534 --> 23:16.137
Follow me.

23:22.908 --> 23:25.377
Um, um, can I help you?

23:25.411 --> 23:26.845
Oh, no, it's fine.

23:26.879 --> 23:29.681
You just have
a very bizarre gait.

23:29.715 --> 23:30.982
I'm... I'm sorry, what?

23:31.017 --> 23:32.317
I'm sorry, what?

23:32.352 --> 23:33.852
[Whispers] Nailed it.

23:33.886 --> 23:36.154
[Huffs]

23:36.188 --> 23:37.656
[Huffs]

23:37.690 --> 23:39.457
Castle, please tell me
I don't move like that.

23:39.491 --> 23:41.826
I mean... do I?

23:45.031 --> 23:46.264
Is this a trick question?

23:46.298 --> 23:49.467
What answer is not gonna have me
sleeping on the couch tonight?

23:52.571 --> 23:57.041
Chad, find out who called in
a day pass for a Kurt van Zant.

23:57.075 --> 23:58.976
You're looking at him, sir.

23:59.010 --> 24:01.546
Wait a minute.
You called in the pass? Why?

24:01.580 --> 24:04.014
I was told to by Mr. Valentine.

24:04.049 --> 24:05.849
- Danny Valentine?
- Danny Valentine!

24:08.086 --> 24:11.354
Oh, I knew it. That smug,
no-talent playboy...

24:11.389 --> 24:13.390
he's up to his neck in this!

24:13.424 --> 24:16.093
Danny: Hey, hey! Hey! Help!
Help! [Man grunting]

24:16.127 --> 24:18.095
Help! He's gonna kill me!
[Crashing]

24:18.129 --> 24:20.764
Wait, no! Help! N.Y.P.D.!

24:20.799 --> 24:22.666
Help! Aah!

24:22.700 --> 24:23.866
Let him go!

24:23.901 --> 24:25.068
What?! No!

24:27.348 --> 24:28.814
Pull him in, van Zant, now!

24:28.849 --> 24:31.217
Hey, lady, relax!
[Siren wailing in distance]

24:33.179 --> 24:35.333
[Groans]
Come on, let me see your hands.

24:35.353 --> 24:37.742
[Horns honk]

24:39.851 --> 24:41.140
[Sighs] Thanks.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.493
[Handcuffs clinking]
Guy's a psychopath.

24:42.528 --> 24:44.429
Then why did you give him a pass to get on?
[Handcuffs clicking]

24:44.463 --> 24:45.931
He left a note at my hotel.

24:45.965 --> 24:47.766
He said he had information
about Sid's murder.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.167
Are you saying you don't
know this man?

24:49.201 --> 24:50.618
I never him before today.

24:50.638 --> 24:53.071
Listen, this whole thing is
a big misunderstanding.

24:53.105 --> 24:55.411
I'm sure it is. Come on.

24:57.142 --> 24:59.110
So what information did he have
about Sid's murder?

24:59.144 --> 25:01.011
Nothing. I mean,
this was a shakedown.

25:01.046 --> 25:03.814
He claimed Sid owed him money
for "Saturday Night Tonight,"

25:03.848 --> 25:05.283
but since Sid didn't pay,
he wanted me

25:05.317 --> 25:07.117
to sign over my shares
of the show.

25:07.151 --> 25:10.399
- You own a piece of the show?
- Mm, 5%.

25:10.911 --> 25:13.323
Sid needed a...
a celebrity get for the pilot,

25:13.357 --> 25:15.125
so he gave me
a piece of the back end.

25:15.159 --> 25:17.529
It was the deal of my life.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.529
So van Zant wanted his cut,
but with Sid dead,

25:19.564 --> 25:21.364
his only option
was to come after yours.

25:21.399 --> 25:23.866
I refused. I-I said, "hey,
that's show business, baby,"

25:23.901 --> 25:27.604
but that's when he started
shoving me out the window.

25:27.638 --> 25:29.806
35 years in Folsom.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.442
That's a long time to hold
a grudge, Mr. van Zant.

25:32.477 --> 25:35.178
Lady, I didn't kill Sid.

25:35.213 --> 25:37.380
And yet you were seen
fleeing the alley

25:37.415 --> 25:39.015
where those shots were fired.

25:39.049 --> 25:42.051
It's not hard to imagine
that you would follow Sid

25:42.086 --> 25:43.712
and finish off the job.

25:43.732 --> 25:47.223
Look. You got this all wrong!

25:47.257 --> 25:49.525
When I got paroled,
I went straight to Sid.

25:49.559 --> 25:51.560
We had it out,
and he apologized.

25:51.595 --> 25:53.129
Except now he's dead.

25:53.163 --> 25:54.497
Why would I move on him?

25:54.531 --> 25:57.133
He agreed to give me
a major chunk of change

25:57.167 --> 26:00.402
of an upcoming sale of shares
to some equity group.

26:00.437 --> 26:01.604
So we were good.

26:01.638 --> 26:04.006
That doesn't square with you
shooting at him in the alley.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.674
That wasn't me. I swear!

26:05.708 --> 26:08.910
If it wasn't you,
then who was it?

26:08.945 --> 26:10.712
I don't know.

26:10.747 --> 26:12.848
Sid called me and told me

26:12.882 --> 26:15.216
the paperwork for my stake
in the show was ready.

26:15.251 --> 26:17.552
But he wouldn't sign off

26:17.586 --> 26:19.855
unless I brought him something.

26:20.271 --> 26:21.857
Okay, fine.

26:21.891 --> 26:24.259
I'll play along.

26:24.599 --> 26:26.594
What did Sid want you to bring?

26:26.629 --> 26:29.164
An unregistered gun.

26:29.198 --> 26:31.166
Why would Sid want a gun?

26:31.200 --> 26:33.368
Wait, no. Let me guess.
He didn't tell you.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.270
It's true!

26:35.304 --> 26:37.071
He just told me to meet him
near that alley

26:37.105 --> 26:39.006
at 11:30, so I did.

26:39.041 --> 26:40.741
I gave him a .38 special,

26:40.776 --> 26:42.277
and he told me I could pick up

26:42.311 --> 26:44.379
the signed papers
in the morning.

26:44.413 --> 26:45.913
And then he told me
I should take a hike.

26:45.947 --> 26:47.081
But you didn't.

26:47.115 --> 26:49.416
Well... a man asks for a gun,

26:49.450 --> 26:51.451
he's looking to dance
with danger.

26:51.486 --> 26:54.188
I thought it wise
to protect my investment.

26:54.222 --> 26:56.023
So you're saying that
you stuck around

26:56.058 --> 26:58.625
- just to see what would happen.
- Yep.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.562
Saw Sid go down the alley
and hide in a doorway.

27:01.596 --> 27:03.063
20 minutes go by,

27:03.097 --> 27:05.232
and some dude in a mask
shows up.

27:05.266 --> 27:08.302
Opens the dumpster,
pulls out a green duffel bag.

27:08.336 --> 27:10.136
And what was in the duffel bag?

27:10.171 --> 27:11.305
Hell if I know.

27:11.339 --> 27:14.241
But that's when Sid jumps out
with the gun, screaming,

27:14.275 --> 27:17.244
"you got what you wanted!
Now where is she?"

27:17.278 --> 27:18.778
Who is "she"?

27:18.813 --> 27:20.246
I have no idea.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.381
But the masked man
got the drop on Sid.

27:22.416 --> 27:25.151
They wrestled for the gun,
and then, pop, pop, pop!

27:25.186 --> 27:27.120
Shots go off in the air!

27:27.154 --> 27:29.222
You know what? If you were
protecting your investment,

27:29.256 --> 27:31.290
then why didn't you
help him out?

27:31.325 --> 27:32.726
Well, Sid ran off.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.560
And the guy in the mask
wasn't giving chase,

27:34.595 --> 27:36.596
so I figured, well,
I'm on parole.

27:36.630 --> 27:39.298
I need to bug out before
the cops show up.

27:40.210 --> 27:41.499
And that's all you did?

27:41.534 --> 27:43.801
I drove to Sid's building
to see if I could catch him

27:43.836 --> 27:46.137
and ask him what the hell
he got me into.

27:46.171 --> 27:48.005
But he never showed up.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.408
Next thing I know, he's dead.

27:50.443 --> 27:52.244
Esposito: I think
he's telling the truth.

27:52.278 --> 27:53.778
Security video outside
of Sid's apartment

27:53.812 --> 27:55.614
shows van Zant waiting out front

27:55.648 --> 27:58.149
in his car from 12:30 A.M.
to 3:30 in the morning.

27:58.183 --> 28:00.184
That's on the other side
of town from the studio.

28:00.219 --> 28:01.619
Yeah, van Zant
couldn't have done it.

28:01.653 --> 28:03.354
Okay, that dumpster
that you searched...

28:03.388 --> 28:04.756
there was no duffel bag?

28:04.790 --> 28:06.357
The guy in the mask
must have taken it,

28:06.391 --> 28:07.792
which means that Sid
must have been the guy

28:07.826 --> 28:08.893
who dropped it off.

28:08.927 --> 28:10.594
This has to be the deal
that Sid was talking about,

28:10.629 --> 28:12.363
and that duffel bag
was the payoff.

28:12.397 --> 28:13.830
Yeah, it sure was.

28:13.865 --> 28:15.499
I spoke with
the business manager.

28:15.533 --> 28:17.934
He just discovered that
on the day he was murdered,

28:17.969 --> 28:20.604
- Sid made a huge bank withdrawal.
- How huge?

28:20.639 --> 28:22.205
$4 million
in nonsequential bills.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.106
Nonsequential bills?

28:23.141 --> 28:25.309
You guys, this was
a ransom gone wrong.

28:25.343 --> 28:27.478
That's why Sid asked,
"where is she?"

28:27.512 --> 28:30.213
- Some woman is his life was kidnapped.
- Yeah, but who?

28:30.248 --> 28:31.614
That's what we got to find out.

28:31.649 --> 28:33.825
'Cause whoever took her
might be our killer.

28:35.991 --> 28:38.006
The cast and the crew
of "Saturday night tonight"

28:38.026 --> 28:39.226
are all at the studio.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.528
No one is missing.

28:40.562 --> 28:44.322
So we've covered Sid's wife,
his family, his friends, and now his job.

28:44.342 --> 28:45.618
Everyone's accounted for.

28:45.638 --> 28:47.727
Uh, actually, not everyone.

28:47.747 --> 28:49.951
Evelyn Ross, Sid's first wife.

28:49.971 --> 28:51.175
She's missing?

28:51.195 --> 28:52.672
Well, I followed up
with Sid's son,

28:52.706 --> 28:54.289
and he said that she
hadn't returned

28:54.309 --> 28:56.819
any of his phone calls,
so I spoke with her doorman.

28:56.839 --> 28:59.026
He said that Evelyn went
on her usual 6:00 A.M. run

28:59.046 --> 29:00.880
two days ago,
and he hasn't seen her since.

29:00.914 --> 29:02.448
She's got to be our kidnap Vic.

29:02.482 --> 29:04.050
Yes, and I was able
to ping her cell phone.

29:04.084 --> 29:05.217
- "Yes, and..."
- I wasn't doing that.

29:05.252 --> 29:07.486
- No, you did it just now.
- Anyway, uniforms found the phone

29:07.521 --> 29:10.222
dumped in a trash can
near a bodega in the Bronx,

29:10.257 --> 29:12.024
probably tossed there
by her kidnapper.

29:12.058 --> 29:13.559
Something's not right here.

29:13.593 --> 29:15.394
Starting with our
victim's behavior.

29:15.428 --> 29:16.895
You're Sid. Your ex-wife
gets kidnapped.

29:16.929 --> 29:19.331
[Cell phone chimes] The deal in the
alley to get her back goes south.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.200
At that point, why wouldn't
you go to the police?

29:21.234 --> 29:22.901
Why do you go back
to your office?

29:22.935 --> 29:24.870
I'll circle back with Sid's
office, see what I can find out.

29:24.904 --> 29:27.505
Yo, unis just arrived
with Evelyn's phone.

29:27.540 --> 29:29.374
[Beep] Woman: This is
Evelyn's cloud account.

29:29.408 --> 29:31.209
It's synched to her cell phone.

29:31.243 --> 29:33.178
Map my jog.
That's a fitness app.

29:33.212 --> 29:34.345
- Can you click on it?
- Mm-hmm.

29:34.380 --> 29:36.581
Esposito: Looks like it's been
running this whole time.

29:36.615 --> 29:38.150
I've seen this app before.

29:38.184 --> 29:40.085
They use G.P.S. to calculate

29:40.119 --> 29:42.054
a jogger's distance and pace

29:42.088 --> 29:43.488
and most importantly,
their route.

29:43.522 --> 29:46.090
Can you replay
Evelyn's last path?

29:46.124 --> 29:47.058
[Key clicks, beep]

29:47.092 --> 29:49.093
That's her leaving her building.
[Beeping]

29:49.127 --> 29:51.696
Okay, so she jogged to the park.

29:51.730 --> 29:54.399
Wait. Is this when she
got kidnapped?

29:54.433 --> 29:56.701
It's got to be. She's moving
at 30 miles an hour.

29:56.735 --> 29:57.935
- She had to have been in a vehicle.
- Yeah.

29:57.969 --> 30:01.072
Can you fast-forward so that
we can see where she ended up?

30:01.106 --> 30:04.108
[Types] So she was
taken up to the Bronx.

30:04.142 --> 30:05.976
[Beep]

30:07.378 --> 30:09.791
Okay, looks like she stopped
at this building.

30:09.811 --> 30:11.716
Evelyn might still be
in that building.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.150
What do we know
about that place?

30:13.184 --> 30:14.585
- I don't know. We'll find out.
- Okay.

30:14.620 --> 30:15.586
[Cell phone vibrates, beeps]

30:15.621 --> 30:18.088
Hey, Ryan, you find
anything in Sid's office?

30:18.123 --> 30:20.157
No, just paperwork
and spreadsheets.

30:20.191 --> 30:22.759
So nothing that speaks to
a possible kidnapping?

30:22.794 --> 30:24.828
Pretty straightforward stuff,
but I'll bring it in

30:24.862 --> 30:26.630
so we can go through it
with a fine-tooth comb.

30:26.664 --> 30:28.732
[Computer beeps]
Beckett, we got something.

30:28.766 --> 30:30.467
[Typing]
Okay, Ryan, I got to go.

30:30.501 --> 30:31.668
That building where Evelyn
was taken

30:31.702 --> 30:33.002
is an abandoned warehouse.

30:33.037 --> 30:35.305
It's the ideal location
to hold someone hostage.

30:36.441 --> 30:39.175
N.Y.P.D.!

30:39.209 --> 30:41.144
Go, go, go!

30:43.448 --> 30:44.781
There. Over there.

30:44.816 --> 30:46.817
Over here! Kick it.

30:46.851 --> 30:48.952
[Clank]

30:51.101 --> 30:52.588
Evelyn?
[Whimpers]

30:52.622 --> 30:54.324
We're the police.
You're safe now.

30:54.358 --> 30:56.025
[Whimpers]

30:56.764 --> 30:58.761
[Gasps] Oh, God...

31:00.425 --> 31:02.966
I just had stopped to stretch,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.534
and the next thing I knew,
there was a rag

31:05.569 --> 31:08.036
over my mouth, and...

31:08.071 --> 31:12.942
Uh, when I came to,
I was in that warehouse.

31:13.661 --> 31:15.277
At any point in time,
did you get a look

31:15.311 --> 31:17.312
at your kidnapper's face?

31:17.347 --> 31:18.981
He always wore a mask.

31:19.015 --> 31:21.951
It was like a ski mask,
but shiny,

31:21.985 --> 31:25.020
with a silver zigzag
up the middle

31:25.054 --> 31:28.245
and... a gold headband.

31:28.695 --> 31:30.392
A gold headband?
Are you sure about that?

31:30.426 --> 31:32.327
I'm pretty sure
that's what it was.

31:32.362 --> 31:34.696
And, uh, how about his clothes?

31:34.730 --> 31:37.065
Do you remember anything
distinctive about them?

31:38.113 --> 31:39.804
No.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.204
But... he wore a ring.

31:43.238 --> 31:47.509
A red and silver signet ring
on his right hand.

31:47.543 --> 31:48.710
I remember that.

31:48.744 --> 31:50.244
Evelyn, back to the mask...

31:50.278 --> 31:53.180
did it look anything like this?

31:53.863 --> 31:57.151
Yes, exactly like that.

31:57.185 --> 31:58.920
Is that from
"Saturday Night Tonight"?

31:58.940 --> 32:01.255
It's from an obscure sketch
they did two years ago

32:01.289 --> 32:03.310
called "lucha libre
brunch buffet."

32:03.330 --> 32:05.092
So our kidnapper had access

32:05.127 --> 32:07.194
to the props and wardrobe room
at the studio.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.862
This was an inside job.

32:08.897 --> 32:10.998
<i>Man on monitor: What do you
mean, a banana sandwich?</i>

32:11.033 --> 32:13.667
<i>[Audience laughing]
Carly! Carly Rae...</i>

32:13.701 --> 32:15.669
Carly Rae Jepsen!
I'm Rick. I'm Rick.

32:15.703 --> 32:17.237
I'm... uh, this is Kate.
We're huge fans.

32:17.271 --> 32:19.205
Oh, thanks.
That means a lot to me.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.274
So nice to meet you.
Um, Castle, we really need to...

32:21.308 --> 32:23.343
yeah, Carly, quick question...
that one song,

32:23.377 --> 32:25.679
um, "Call Me Maybe," what did
you mean by the lyric...

32:25.713 --> 32:27.213
- it's in the first...
- Carly, two minutes.

32:27.248 --> 32:29.715
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I have to go perform this song.

32:29.750 --> 32:30.850
Oh, that... that's cool.

32:30.884 --> 32:32.118
We gotta go solve a murder,
so...

32:32.153 --> 32:34.921
Okay. Okay...
nice to meet you. Bye.

32:36.823 --> 32:38.525
Excuse me.

32:38.559 --> 32:40.893
Someone recently checked out
one of these masks,

32:40.928 --> 32:43.263
- and we need to know who.
- Now?

32:43.297 --> 32:44.730
We're in the middle
of a live show.

32:44.765 --> 32:47.132
It was from the "lucha libre
brunch buffet" sketch.

32:47.167 --> 32:49.068
Yeah, that sketch sucked.

32:49.102 --> 32:50.469
We haven't used those masks
in years.

32:50.503 --> 32:51.871
Well, is there a record
of someone signing it out?

32:51.905 --> 32:53.873
Probably not, but I can check.

32:53.907 --> 32:55.975
- Can you give me like five minutes?
- Okay. We'll be back.

32:56.009 --> 32:56.642
[Audience cheering]

32:56.677 --> 33:00.245
We are so close.
[Sighs]

33:00.280 --> 33:01.980
Yeah, but who would be
so brazen...

33:02.014 --> 33:05.917
or so naive... as to use
a mask from the show

33:05.952 --> 33:07.919
to perpetrate a kidnapping?
[Laughter]

33:07.954 --> 33:08.954

34:39.775 --> 34:42.126
down at the 12th precinct.
Let's go.

34:45.386 --> 34:46.681
So, Chad, tell us,

34:46.702 --> 34:48.667
how long have you been
a page with "S.N.T."?

34:48.687 --> 34:51.351
Uh, five incredible years. Why?

34:51.371 --> 34:53.572
Don't most pages quit
if they don't get promoted

34:53.592 --> 34:54.827
after a year or two?

34:54.860 --> 34:57.196
Uh, for me, it's worth the wait.

34:57.230 --> 34:58.405
Any day now.

34:58.425 --> 35:00.499
Yeah, sorry. I don't buy it.

35:00.872 --> 35:03.001
I think you got tired
of waiting,

35:03.036 --> 35:05.670
and after so many years,
you wanted payback.

35:05.705 --> 35:07.515
Payback?
What do you mean, payback?

35:07.535 --> 35:10.322
I'm talking about
the $4 million kind.

35:10.342 --> 35:13.011
You kidnapped Sid's ex-wife.

35:13.657 --> 35:14.805
Wait, what?

35:14.825 --> 35:16.782
Castle:
It was a pretty clever plan.

35:16.816 --> 35:18.384
All except for that one
tiny detail

35:18.404 --> 35:20.218
that you could not have
foreseen...

35:20.253 --> 35:23.576
Sid confronting you
at the money drop.

35:23.596 --> 35:26.691
He recognized your ring,
didn't he?

35:26.725 --> 35:29.461
That was when you realized
your only way out

35:29.495 --> 35:31.570
was to kill him.

35:32.231 --> 35:34.465
You think I killed Mr. Ross?

35:34.499 --> 35:36.701
You can drop the act.
We know what you did.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.335
Even Evelyn saw your ring.

35:38.370 --> 35:41.973
[Stammers] I-I bought this
ring at the "S.N.T." gift shop.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.641
Lots of people have it.

35:43.676 --> 35:45.710
Yeah, except lots of people
don't have evidence

35:45.744 --> 35:47.530
in their apartments.

35:47.550 --> 35:49.380
What are you talking about?

35:49.414 --> 35:50.914
I didn't do anything!

35:50.948 --> 35:52.849
So then why don't you explain
how detectives found

35:52.884 --> 35:55.486
a .38 revolver
and a lucha libre mask

35:55.520 --> 35:56.853
under your bed?

35:56.888 --> 36:00.047
[Exhales nervously] Um...

36:00.067 --> 36:02.893
Must have been an evil
tooth fairy who put it there,

36:02.927 --> 36:05.762
'cause it wasn't me.
[Chuckles nervously]

36:05.797 --> 36:08.284
Please, I-I-I didn't do this.

36:08.304 --> 36:11.003
All right, then where were you
the night that Sid was murdered?

36:11.023 --> 36:13.870
- At home.
- Can anyone verify that?

36:16.138 --> 36:18.154
No.

36:21.045 --> 36:24.377
<i>Sid was a tough S.O.B.,
but he loved his job,</i>

36:24.397 --> 36:27.050
<i>and his job was to get us
to make America laugh.</i>

36:27.084 --> 36:29.819
<i>And tonight we honor him
by doing just that.</i>

36:29.853 --> 36:31.554
Chad can't be the killer,
can he?

36:31.588 --> 36:33.281
Well, it doesn't feel right,

36:33.301 --> 36:34.724
but there is
an abundance of evidence.

36:34.758 --> 36:37.627
Yeah, it's too abundant...
the mask, the gun, the ring?

36:37.661 --> 36:39.595
It's just too... perfect.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.659
So, what, you think
he was framed?

36:41.861 --> 36:43.702
I think there's more
to this story.

36:43.722 --> 36:45.635
You know, it's possible
that the killer wanted

36:45.669 --> 36:47.336
Evelyn to see the mask
and the ring.

36:47.370 --> 36:49.004
Chad <i>is the perfect fall guy.</i>

36:49.039 --> 36:51.841
Okay, but if Chad
didn't do it, then who did?

36:51.875 --> 36:54.109
I...may have a line on that.

36:54.144 --> 36:56.312
I figured out what Sid
was doing in his office

36:56.346 --> 36:57.813
with those spreadsheets.

36:57.847 --> 36:59.949
He was going over his
corporate bank accounts.

36:59.983 --> 37:02.484
Sid went from paying
a kidnapper at gunpoint

37:02.518 --> 37:04.420
to checking
his corporate financials?

37:04.454 --> 37:05.988
That's... weird.

37:06.022 --> 37:08.623
That's not the only thing
that's weird.

37:08.658 --> 37:11.593
Check out those expenses
he highlighted.

37:11.627 --> 37:12.561
[Telephone
ringing in distance]

37:12.595 --> 37:15.296
Oh, these <i>are</i> weird, because...

37:15.331 --> 37:17.699
Because I called the bank
in the Cayman Islands.

37:17.733 --> 37:19.468
All of those expenses are bogus.

37:19.502 --> 37:21.636
So someone with access
at Sid's company

37:21.671 --> 37:23.304
was embezzling money.

37:23.339 --> 37:25.273
Almost $4 million,

37:25.307 --> 37:26.641
the exact amount of the ransom.

37:26.676 --> 37:28.276
Wait, that's it.

37:28.310 --> 37:30.311
The embezzler was trying
to replace the money

37:30.346 --> 37:31.412
he had stolen from Sid.

37:31.447 --> 37:33.814
- I know who the killer is.
- I know who the killer is.

37:33.849 --> 37:36.784
Nice. In fairness, though,
I walked you right through that.

37:39.588 --> 37:41.689
Woman:
Places for the final sketch!

37:41.723 --> 37:44.425
Places for the final sketch.

37:45.927 --> 37:48.562
[Audience laughing]

37:48.597 --> 37:49.630
[Snaps fingers]

37:56.070 --> 37:58.706
Oh. Hi. I-is everything
all right?

37:58.740 --> 38:01.308
Yes. In fact,
we have some good news.

38:01.342 --> 38:03.310
Great. Let's talk
after the show.

38:03.344 --> 38:06.546
Actually, show is already
over... at least for you.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.748
- Excuse me?
- Drop the act, Mr. Vogel.

38:08.782 --> 38:11.385
We know that you killed Sid.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.653
- That's insane.
- Not really.

38:13.687 --> 38:15.922
Not considering the partial
sale of Sid's company

38:15.956 --> 38:18.058
was on the horizon,
a sale that would mean

38:18.092 --> 38:19.659
a review of the company's books.

38:19.693 --> 38:21.327
Which would expose
the $4 million

38:21.361 --> 38:22.595
that you embezzled.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.731
What?! Are you out of your mind?

38:24.765 --> 38:26.599
No, but you must have been.

38:26.634 --> 38:28.835
Faced with the inevitability
of being caught,

38:28.869 --> 38:30.737
you had to do something,

38:30.771 --> 38:32.872
so you kidnapped
and ransomed Evelyn

38:32.907 --> 38:35.607
in order to "reimburse"
the money you'd stolen.

38:35.642 --> 38:37.876
A duffel bag full of cash
would be easy to deposit

38:37.911 --> 38:40.279
in the company's
Cayman Island bank,

38:40.313 --> 38:42.415
where no questions are asked.

38:42.449 --> 38:43.782
And after that,
all you'd have to do

38:43.816 --> 38:45.584
is falsify a few
bank statements,

38:45.618 --> 38:47.253
and you'd be in the clear.

38:47.287 --> 38:49.522
How dare you. This is absurd!

38:49.556 --> 38:51.590
We followed the money, Gene.

38:51.624 --> 38:54.937
You siphoned the $4 million
to invest in a startup company.

38:54.957 --> 38:56.795
And when that company went
belly-up,

38:56.829 --> 38:58.430
you could not get
your money back.

38:58.464 --> 39:00.432
Sid must have recognized you
at the drop,

39:00.466 --> 39:02.968
but he didn't confront you
until after he discovered

39:03.002 --> 39:04.135
the faked expenses.

39:04.170 --> 39:06.371
So you killed him?

39:06.405 --> 39:07.439
Gene, how could you?

39:07.473 --> 39:10.708
No! These are... these
are baseless accusations.

39:10.742 --> 39:12.910
- They can't prove anything.
- Actually, we can.

39:12.945 --> 39:14.612
We went through
your financials and found

39:14.646 --> 39:17.215
millions in undeclared deposits
from Sid's company.

39:17.249 --> 39:18.983
Oh, by the way, nice touch

39:19.017 --> 39:22.420
wearing the mask
and "S.N.T." ring that Chad has.

39:22.455 --> 39:24.322
Only problem
with your frame job...

39:24.356 --> 39:25.656
you were witnessed
hanging around

39:25.691 --> 39:27.458
outside his apartment
this afternoon

39:27.492 --> 39:28.759
when you planted them.

39:28.794 --> 39:30.227
Oops.

39:30.261 --> 39:31.796
Gene Vogel, you're
under arrest for...

39:31.830 --> 39:35.766
model cop down! I broke a heel!

39:35.801 --> 39:37.401
[Audience laughing]
[Grunting]

39:37.435 --> 39:38.736
[Audience cheering]

39:38.770 --> 39:40.671
Gene Vogel, you're under
arrest for kidnapping

39:40.706 --> 39:42.106
and murder!

Beckett, that was a badass
takedown tonight on that show.

40:05.395 --> 40:07.831
It was strong, yet... sexy.

40:07.865 --> 40:09.766
Yeah, Beckett, the camera
really loves you.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.801
You guys, shut up, both of you.

40:11.836 --> 40:13.692
What about me, guys?
How did I look?

40:13.712 --> 40:15.704
Like you should
stick to writing.

40:15.739 --> 40:17.840
Yeah, I think so.

40:17.874 --> 40:20.643
There's only one star
in this family, kiddo.

40:20.663 --> 40:23.025
Mother, how was
your preview performance?

40:23.045 --> 40:24.880
Well, check out, the, uh,

40:24.914 --> 40:27.082
- the twittervese, as they say.
- All righty.

40:28.945 --> 40:30.886
"Martha Rodgers
is a revelation."

40:31.784 --> 40:34.911
"Martha Rodgers gives
a masterful performance."

40:34.931 --> 40:38.827
"A display of why theater is
still a relevant art form."

40:38.862 --> 40:41.463
"Martha Rodgers is amaze-balls."

40:41.497 --> 40:42.865
Yeah, that... about that...

40:42.899 --> 40:44.232
is that "amaze-balls"
a good thing, because...

40:44.267 --> 40:46.135
It sure is. Congratulations.
[Laughter]

40:46.169 --> 40:48.303
- Congratulations. Okay, oh, great.
- Then we can celebrate.

40:48.337 --> 40:51.573
I brought some champagne
for everybody!

40:51.607 --> 40:53.475
If you'll open it.
Do we have some glasses?

40:53.509 --> 40:55.710
Well, we don't do a lot of
entertaining here, Martha,

40:55.744 --> 40:58.413
- but ta-da!
- Aha!

40:58.447 --> 41:00.282
- Here you go.
- That'll work. Thank you.

41:00.316 --> 41:03.451
- Thank you.
- May I?

41:03.486 --> 41:07.889
Perfect. Thank you, Detective Ryan.
[Champagne pouring]

41:07.923 --> 41:10.724

to my amaze-balls mother.

- Cheers.
