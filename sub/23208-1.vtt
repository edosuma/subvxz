LIFT BELL CHIMES

00:19.520 --> 00:24.560
Welcome to Hotel Zanzibar. I see you
have not stayed with us before.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.080
But, please, feel free to linger
in our corridor

00:27.120 --> 00:30.560
and take a butcher's
around the ninth floor.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.080
The residents who, here, will spend
the night like mountaineers

00:34.120 --> 00:38.680
at base camp, they just might be on
their way up, or on their way down.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.400
Some wear an anorak, others a crown.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.560
Are all here to meet their fate
head-on.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.880
Will Lady Luck smile on you,
come the dawn?

00:47.880 --> 00:49.040
Who knows?

00:49.080 --> 00:52.200
For I'm just here
to link their ships

00:52.240 --> 00:56.400
and smile and smile
and hope for decent tips.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.160
Mr Blue and Mr Brown
are in the building.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.519
For shame, Henry,
why speak you to your cuff?

01:05.560 --> 01:08.920
There's no-one here.
You're armed. Yes, sir. So, chill.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.760
The fact that we use
pseudonyms is enough

01:11.800 --> 01:13.160
to keep me safe from harm, surely.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.000
But, still, I made an oath
to your father the king

01:16.040 --> 01:18.480
that I would keep you
in my sights all week.

01:18.520 --> 01:21.880
His enemies would not hesitate
to bring a gun to a knife fight.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.200
Henry! Let me speak.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.160
You are our country's future,
dearest Prince.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.160
My job's to save you
from any grievous plot.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.360
But all this talk of murder
makes me wince.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.880
Like this iambic foot,
you're stressed. I'm not.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.600
Now, let me to my room.
Good night, God bless.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.880
I take it we have all the channels.
Yes.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.920
Ah, Mr Brown,
your luggage is within.

01:45.960 --> 01:48.080
Do you need a tour of the room?
Not fussed.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.760
And, Mr Blue? I'm in 912, going.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.240
And, just so you know,
that tip's from both of us.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.960
Sleep well, sweet prince.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.800
He shall not live the night.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.720
It is understood assassins
wish him dead

02:10.759 --> 02:13.640
to cleanse our country
of his family's line.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.080
So, when Prince Rico
meets my little friend

02:17.120 --> 02:20.880
and grief does shake
the old King of his wits,

02:20.920 --> 02:23.720
my father
stands in readiness to rule.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.040
Then I will wear
the Prince's crown instead.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.800
And I'm in 911...

02:31.720 --> 02:33.960
..not 912!

02:38.400 --> 02:41.480
Young man, come here.
A word with you, I pray.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.400
I wish to speak more plainly,
if I may.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.800
Sir, it's the only language
I understand. Good.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.200
I wish to order some
room service which is off menu,

02:56.240 --> 02:59.560
if you catch my drift.
I do indeed, sir.

02:59.600 --> 03:03.320
Would you care to describe the dish
you have in mind?

03:03.360 --> 03:04.680
Female. Mm-hmm.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.840
Redhead. Mm-hmm.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.480
Mature. Oh!

03:11.480 --> 03:15.600
Willing to indulge in some
slightly unusual practices.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.120
No problem. Yellow or brown?

03:19.760 --> 03:25.560
What? Does Sir prefer the water sign
or the earth sign? Oh, water.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.640
Oh, absolutely.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.800
Here...

03:32.120 --> 03:35.120
The other half will come...
After you do. I understand.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.760
Leave it with me.
I know just the girl for you.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.560
Oh, happy days!
The fates they do conspire.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.600
I'll profit
from another man's desire.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.480
Yes? I'm sorry, sir,
but may I trouble you?

04:03.520 --> 04:06.160
There is a strange man in my room.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.680
Which room?

04:08.720 --> 04:10.440
It's one of these

04:10.480 --> 04:11.640
but which I cannot say.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.280
Things fall out of my head
so quick these days.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.640
Did you not see
the sign upon my door?

04:16.680 --> 04:19.200
Do not disturb me,
please, I do implore.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.680
Sir, he's got me all aquiver.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.400
And here he comes!
He means me harm. Mother!

04:25.440 --> 04:27.400
I'm so sorry. She wanders off a lot.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.000
Come back to bed,
you're missing Emmerdale.

04:30.040 --> 04:33.440
Is this your son?
I don't know. Yes, I am.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.840
She knows me not,
it's such a sorry tale.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.040
She took a tumble nipping into
Boots, this was in August. 1953.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.560
She hit her head
and now her memory's gone.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.360
My memory's fine!
For them days, not for these.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.960
She's like a goldfish
that you win at t'fair.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.680
You mean, she's going to die
within a week? No!

04:51.720 --> 04:54.120
She swims about
but nothing is retained.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.520
We're trying this new memory
technique.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.800
Are you my husband?
No, he's just a man.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.920
A man who wishes
to be left in peace.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.360
If that is all,
I'm going to close the door.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.560
I met him once on Coronation Street.
Oh, mother!

05:12.800 --> 05:15.360
I can't believe you made me
walk in heels.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.200
A taxi would have been, like, ã15.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.960
Then you make me
carry all these bags.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.880
You know full well my back
is really bad.

05:21.920 --> 05:26.400
Why pay a boy in uniform a pound for
doing something we can do ourselves?

05:26.440 --> 05:29.880
Sweetheart, don't be angry with me,
please. You have the key card?

05:29.920 --> 05:31.960
Yes, I've got it here.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.600
Doesn't seem to work.
Don't know why.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.600
What if I pop it quickly in and out?
Just like our sex life. Amber!

05:40.640 --> 05:41.760
Sorry.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.920
No joy.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.040
I'll go back to reception.
You wait here.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.840
No joy.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.520
No joy we've had for ages now.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.160
Ten years together.
Maybe that's our peak.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.200
Our love has turned as stale
as last week's bread.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.560
Long gone the days
when he made my knees weak.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.800
A night in a hotel
won't be enough to keep my heart

06:05.840 --> 06:08.080
from all this nagging doubt.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.800
Do I extend my holiday with Gus

06:10.840 --> 06:13.360
or do I pay my bill
and then check out?

06:13.400 --> 06:15.520
Madame, are you locked
out of your room?

06:15.560 --> 06:17.600
Yes, my boyfriend's
gone to fetch another card.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.440
Oh, they are most unreliable.
Boyfriends?

06:20.480 --> 06:22.520
No, the key cards.
But I know what you mean.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.760
My Fred, he's the bellboy.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.000
He can be a bit tricky sometimes
but he's got a good heart.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.920
Have you been together a long time?
Oh, yeah, ages. 15 weeks.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.280
He is forever trying to drag me
into one of the empty rooms

06:33.320 --> 06:34.600
for a bit of how's your father.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.760
But that turns me right off
because my father's dead.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.880
At least he's attentive.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.520
Yeah, he's always standing to
attention, if you take my meaning.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.600
But there is nothing
he wouldn't do for me.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.160
So, do you want me to let you in?
I've got a pass key.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.880
No. Do you have
any other rooms available?

06:50.920 --> 06:52.520
Um, there's nobody booked in 913.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.400
I can show you in there,
if you like.

06:55.520 --> 06:59.280
You're right.
A woman should be wooed. With care.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.360
Oh, no!
We haven't had it off in there.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.200
Excuse me, Miss.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.320
I hate to be a bore.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.000
I was looking at my key card

07:09.040 --> 07:12.120
And I saw the number
of this room is 911.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.040
For me to stay in here
can't be done.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.680
You do not like the number, sir?
No way.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.520
Well, 914 has just come free today.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.400
Oh, I'm very superstitious
as a rate.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.960
To stay in 911's tempting fate.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.640
Well, at least,
you haven't had to travel far.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.040
Have you taken anything
from the minibar?

07:31.080 --> 07:33.920
No, but will you tell the bellboy
on this floor

07:33.960 --> 07:36.680
the watersports will now be 914.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.880
What watersports?
We haven't got a pool.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.400
Excuse me,
I am missing a plug for my bath.

07:45.440 --> 07:49.080
It's not electric, sir, that would
be dangerous. To keep the water in!

07:49.120 --> 07:52.680
Oh, that kind of plug. I'll try
and find you one, Mr... Green.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.240
Poor girl,
she does not know the reason why

07:59.280 --> 08:00.840
I need a bath plug urgently.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.520
For that,
which stops the water running out,

08:05.560 --> 08:09.200
will stop also what little life
there is in me.

08:10.360 --> 08:14.800
When these blue rivers
in my wrist do run and mingle

08:14.840 --> 08:17.680
with the cheap bath salts and soap

08:17.720 --> 08:21.400
then will my guilt
drain out with them to sea.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.760
And will my children mourn?
I can but hope.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.240
My boys.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.840
My twins were given up at birth.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.640
Their mother died,
I was still in jail.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.720
One stayed in England,
one was sent abroad.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.280
I know not what became
of either one.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.920
So, tonight,

08:46.960 --> 08:49.000
I will put me to my sword.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.000
But for a bath plug.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.040
Then, 'tis quickly done.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.000
I have the new card here, Amber.
She's gone.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.800
Perhaps she is inside.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.840
Or has she flown?

09:17.240 --> 09:20.160
Oh, these sodding key cards
never bloody work!

09:21.800 --> 09:24.040
I must have held
it near my mobile phone.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.520
Colette, my dainty dumpling

09:27.560 --> 09:31.120
is going to meet me here for a bit
of how's your dead father.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.640
Leave it on the latch.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.440
Well, the key cards
can't be trusted.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.040
Oh, sir,
may we speak plainly once again?

09:40.080 --> 09:43.320
Of course. You're barking up the
wrong tree. Your room is down here.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.880
911.

09:44.920 --> 09:48.520
Oh, I see. That'll be why the card
refused to work.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.520
Your room service is on its way.
Oh, great.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.920
Bring it straight up, will you?

09:53.960 --> 09:57.000
And, um, be discreet.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.720
Naturally.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.400
Anything else I can help you with,
sir?

10:06.840 --> 10:08.160
No, thank you.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.240
Oh.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.720
Oh.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.400
Very kind, sir.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.080
From ã50 to 20 pence?

10:24.120 --> 10:25.360
What did I do wrong?

10:26.640 --> 10:29.200
She's not yet here.
My plan is now afoot.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.600
I have arranged for an apple tart
to be brought to our room,

10:34.640 --> 10:38.040
but unbeknownst to Amber,
a ring is baked within.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.200
And when she takes her first
big bite of that confectionery,

10:43.240 --> 10:45.800
I will, I hope, she'll say.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.000
And, merrily, we'll marry.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.960
I need a wee.
Be quiet, have some tact.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.320
We must discuss the tariff
for this act. I have to pay?

11:09.360 --> 11:11.120
No, madam, I pay you.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.160
ã1,000.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.680
And how much for a poo?

11:14.720 --> 11:17.920
So, were you once a redhead?
Oh, behave.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.760
I said mature,
not dug up from the grave.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.720
Will you do bondage?

11:22.760 --> 11:25.880
Yes, there's every chance. I did
a course at St John's Ambulance.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.160
I'm glad that you are keen,
that's good to know.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.080
Just tie me up
and you can let it flow.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.720
You know I'm staying
in here tonight?

11:34.760 --> 11:36.200
OK. I need some space.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.600
I care not what you do.
You really are a pig!

11:40.640 --> 11:42.560
What's that? Who's this?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.720
Just go back to bed
and I will join you soon.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.840
No longer in the shadows can I lurk.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.560
'Tis time for me
to attend my grisly work.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.800
But wait, if I am
to be blameless of this deed,

12:14.840 --> 12:18.080
then must I have an alibi as fact.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.680
I did just see
the hypnotist downstairs.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.320
He really did a very funny act.

12:25.280 --> 12:29.440
But wait. What if I could be
the hero of the hour?

12:29.480 --> 12:32.160
As if I've fought
to save the Prince's life,

12:32.200 --> 12:35.360
I'll cut my face
to illustrate my lie.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.280
But what
if I go too deep with a knife.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.320
Oh, come, Henry, stop equivocating!
Act.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.000
The time for dilly-dallying
has gone.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.320
Just raise your hand
and stab his bleeding heart.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.920
I hope I didn't leave
the talkback on.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.000
Hello? Hello.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.720
BELL RINGS

13:01.560 --> 13:03.280
Excuse me, Miss,
do you have my plug?

13:03.320 --> 13:06.400
I do have a plug
but probably not the kind you mean.

13:06.440 --> 13:09.320
Are you the gentleman from 911?
Mr Brown?

13:09.360 --> 13:12.600
I am Mr Brown's security adviser.
What mean you with him?

13:12.640 --> 13:14.880
He's ordered some executive relief.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.040
The details of which
are not for you to know.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.360
Suffice to say, he is the
executive... And you are the relief.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.960
Well, I'll certainly be relieving
myself. Now, let me in, please.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.840
I've got another slot
to fill at ten.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.160
May I ask your name?

13:31.600 --> 13:33.360
Tracey, but people call me Red.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.920
Well, then, Little Red.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.560
How would you to increase your fee
tonight threefold?

13:38.600 --> 13:41.320
You've pricked my interest.
What did you have in mind?

13:41.360 --> 13:44.440
My master has a meeting
in the morn of great import.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.320
I don't want him up all night.
Neither do I, believe me.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.080
After you and he have done the deed,

13:49.120 --> 13:52.120
he, most like,
will imbibe a glass of wine.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.240
Into his cup, this tincture pour.

13:55.280 --> 13:59.440
It is a sedative to help him sleep.
Oh, fine.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.320
I thought you were after
a spit-roast.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.680
No, I just had a sandwich.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.400
Good evening, sir,
I trust that all is well.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.040
Oh, yes. Thank you.
The room is very nice.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.920
I hear you ordered a tart this
evening. I did. Has it arrived?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.080
Just now. Bring it in.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.200
Thus, when the Prince
in deepest slumber lays,

14:30.240 --> 14:34.200
then will I strike
and so avoid his gaze.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.040
Better he dies
still thinking me a friend.

14:37.080 --> 14:41.080
This wench has helped me
bring about his end.

14:44.520 --> 14:48.120
Mother! Mother!
She's vanished from the room.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.720
Two minutes in the shower
and she's gone.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.400
I thought Emmerdale and Corrie
was enough to keep her busy

14:53.440 --> 14:54.560
but she's done a bunk!

14:57.400 --> 15:00.800
I'm sorry to disturb you once again.
You haven't got my mother in there?

15:00.840 --> 15:03.480
No! Why can't you people
just leave me in peace?

15:03.520 --> 15:05.600
Can you not see
that I'm tied up right now?

15:07.520 --> 15:10.440
God knows what goes on behind
these closed doors.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.680
Don't ask, don't tell,
as Mother always says.

15:13.720 --> 15:14.760
BELL RINGS

15:17.240 --> 15:19.760
I'd better find her quick
before she falls.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.920
I'll try the hypnotism show
downstairs.

15:21.960 --> 15:25.720
I saw your hypnotism show
downstairs. It was really good.

15:25.760 --> 15:30.680
Thank you, child. I was exceptional
tonight, though I say so myself.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.160
It is a potent combination of
neurolinguistic programming

15:34.200 --> 15:36.920
and my persuasive vocal technique.
Yeah.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.120
I liked it
when they had to do the hokey cokey

15:39.160 --> 15:41.680
every time you shouted
spaghetti bolognese!

15:41.720 --> 15:45.160
Aye, well, it is important to
entertain as well as educate.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.880
One sometimes has to paint
in primary colours.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.680
This is your room, 916.
Thank you, child.

15:50.720 --> 15:54.920
I'll take a glass of vino
when you're ready. Of course.

15:54.960 --> 16:00.560
And the lady I was telling you about
is there in 913. Ah, yes.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.720
Unhappy in love, you say.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.640
She seems to be, but then I heard
her boyfriend order this.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.120
It has an engagement ring inside.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.520
How very tacky!

16:09.560 --> 16:11.920
She just needs a little persuasion,
that's all.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.840
Is that something you could do?

16:13.880 --> 16:16.680
My child, I have hypnotised smokers
to stop smoking

16:16.720 --> 16:18.360
and fatties to stop eating.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.720
I'm sure I can use my skills
to make true love bloom again.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.600
It would be nice to have
a happy ending,

16:24.640 --> 16:26.640
for I feel I am partly to blame.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.040
Come, I'll take you to her.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.480
Yes? Excuse me, Madam.
This is Vince De Trans.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.400
He's the hypnotist at Zanzibar.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.280
I once regressed a lady
through past lives.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.560
Turned out she was a maid
of Cleopatra.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.560
What on earth has that
to do with me?

16:45.600 --> 16:47.920
If we could come in for a moment,
you will see.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.520
Here you are, Madam.
And I thank you for your pains.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.840
I'm not sure what just happened,
but thanks, Mister.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.520
Would you ever consider
girl on girl?

17:05.560 --> 17:08.400
I did once share a bunk bed
with my sister.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.319
Well, I know my door begins
with number nine.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.599
Oh, this one's open,
guess it must be mine.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.640
Madam! What mean you by this?

17:22.680 --> 17:25.480
Like a scalded she-cat
you have sprayed me!

17:25.520 --> 17:27.200
Why else are you paying me?

17:27.240 --> 17:29.400
Paying you? Paying you?

17:29.440 --> 17:33.520
You have done me
the most disgraceful wrong.

17:33.560 --> 17:36.320
I will see that you are
sorely punished.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.080
Fine. But that'll cost you extra.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.680
Now, come, sirrah,
and take a sip of wine.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.200
Madam, I have take had quite enough
of your fluids. I'll take no more.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.600
What seems to be the issue here,
sir?

17:46.640 --> 17:49.240
Her issue is my issue!

17:49.280 --> 17:53.760
This harlot, this creature,
this redheaded whore...

17:53.800 --> 17:55.400
Yes? ..has just...

17:57.240 --> 17:59.400
I can scarce get out the words.
Has just...

18:00.640 --> 18:03.000
..used me as a privy!

18:03.040 --> 18:04.280
Excellent!

18:04.320 --> 18:08.360
And I trust it all went swimmingly.
He refuses now to pay.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.160
Oh, I must insist you pay the lady,
sir.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.160
Otherwise, she is wont
to stay and make a fuss

18:14.200 --> 18:18.600
and, whilst we're on it, perhaps you
could supply the other half of this?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.320
Have I gone mad?

18:20.360 --> 18:22.000
Has the world turned upside down?

18:22.040 --> 18:24.640
I am assaulted on all sides
then ask to pay for the pleasure.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.800
That's the idea.
Is this some kind of role-play?

18:27.840 --> 18:28.880
Pay me my money!

18:28.920 --> 18:30.800
I will not!

18:32.560 --> 18:34.280
Will you please be quiet!

18:34.320 --> 18:36.040
You keep me from my work.

18:38.120 --> 18:44.000
Look, Red. You wait up here awhile
and I will soothe his ire.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.280
I'm hungry and you promised me
a meal.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.800
Here, take these leftovers.
Leftovers? Look!

18:50.840 --> 18:55.320
Here, have this.
It hasn't been touched. OK.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.360
Give me but two minutes, I prithee.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.120
Now, child, the ritual is complete
and she is in a trancelike state.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.400
When you bring her boyfriend
to her door,

19:11.440 --> 19:14.280
she will look upon him
with new-found ardour

19:14.320 --> 19:17.520
and passionately embrace him.
Thank you, Vince.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.640
Cupid himself
could not have aimed more true.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.680
I'll fetch him right away.

19:21.720 --> 19:22.760
Ah!

19:22.800 --> 19:23.840
Perfect.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.520
Hello, kind sir.
I am Colette the maid.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.000
I'm on an errand,
if you would be led.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.080
Ah, good the maid.
You must have read my mind.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.040
There's been little spillage
on the bed.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.400
Oh, but, sir. I mean...

19:36.880 --> 19:42.840
No, Mrs Hargreaves, you're in here.
918. Are you my son? No. Oh.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.440
I had him with me
but he's forever wandering off.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.880
BELL

19:48.920 --> 19:51.240
I have searched every floor
from one to nine.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.800
Of my mother, alas,
there is no sign.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.000
I curse the day
that she went into Boots.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.280
She only wanted
Schwarzkopf for her roots.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.520
She slipped and went down
like a tonne of bricks,

20:00.560 --> 20:02.720
covered from head to toe
in Tixylix

20:02.760 --> 20:05.000
Oh, I should never have let
her from my sight.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.800
I pray that someone's
seen her here tonight.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.200
Ah, hello.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.520
What angel is this
knocks upon my door? Sorry?

20:15.560 --> 20:20.080
My heart has burst
and overflowed with joy.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.240
A vision of such beauty
and rare poise.

20:24.280 --> 20:27.120
I did do ballet lessons as a boy.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.440
Thine eyes are pools
wherein I see myself.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.320
Thy apple cheeks are soft
as new-fallen snow.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.600
What are you doing?

20:34.640 --> 20:36.800
Two cherry lips,
I long to take a bite.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.160
I'm going to be reporting this!

20:38.200 --> 20:40.880
Thy firm physique
doth make my juices flow!

20:40.920 --> 20:43.440
It's very nice to meet you,
Mrs... Miss!

20:43.480 --> 20:46.760
And I intend to have you now,
right here!

20:46.800 --> 20:48.680
There is a little problem
with that plan.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.360
I hate to have to tell you,
but I'm...

20:50.400 --> 20:52.880
..not looking for a relationship
at the moment.

20:52.920 --> 20:56.040
If you just come with me.
Alas, what's this?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.040
Fair Amber
with another man entwined.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.600
She must have seen him first.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.080
Madam, desist!
Your boyfriend's here.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.400
I do not care for him.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.520
This man, this god!

21:05.560 --> 21:08.240
This vision is my love.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.280
Come, let me see thy mighty sword.
Go away!

21:11.320 --> 21:14.040
I wish to keep my sword
within its sheath!

21:14.080 --> 21:16.120
It's more like
a little dagger anyway.

21:16.160 --> 21:19.560
Sir, speak you to your girlfriend
and explain. She has the wrong man.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.600
I know her not. She slapped my face.
The woman is insane.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.040
Insane with love!

21:25.080 --> 21:27.360
And there is but one cure. Oh, God!

21:27.400 --> 21:29.680
I've waited long enough in there!

21:29.720 --> 21:31.200
Pay up!

21:31.240 --> 21:34.200
Pay up? For what?
I know not what you mean.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.280
This hotel is full of madwomen,
I swear.

21:36.320 --> 21:39.360
You take the piss!
No, you took it from me.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.800
Oh!

21:42.160 --> 21:44.680
Mother! Where have you been?
You had me worried.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.400
I found her wandering
in the corridor.

21:46.440 --> 21:47.920
Here's 50 for your trouble.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.240
Mother!
Where did you get that money from?

21:50.280 --> 21:51.520
From him.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.160
Give me that money, grandma!
I've earned it.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.600
Well, I earned it, too.
Though how, I can't recall.

21:56.640 --> 22:00.240
You did screw my boyfriend.
Did you, Mother? It's all my fault.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.160
I've messed it up.
Calm down.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.360
We just need to untangle
what is tangled.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.960
This gentleman was booked in 914.
No, that is Mr Brown from 911.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.920
In bed with Red
while Amber was next door.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.000
Then, Mr Green in 915...

22:11.040 --> 22:12.600
His bath plug!
..and Blue in 912.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.640
Who have I missed?
Red, Amber, Green.

22:14.680 --> 22:15.680
Am I coming or going?

22:15.720 --> 22:17.720
We need to
speak to Vince the hypnotist.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.160
Prince Rico, what has happened?
Aren't you tired?

22:23.200 --> 22:24.640
I thought you would be sleeping now.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.960
With this? You have to give me
shelter from these people

22:27.000 --> 22:28.840
Good Henry,
you're the only one I trust.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.960
Oh, Amber. There you are, my love.
I've missed you.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.320
I've not missed you,
you necrophiliac.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.520
I'm sorry?

22:42.560 --> 22:44.480
I saw you in your room
with that old hussy.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.840
Excuse me, I'm not that old!

22:45.880 --> 22:46.920
She means me.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.880
I know I haven't been
the perfect boyfriend.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.560
But I want to show you this.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.280
Is this my cake?

22:58.320 --> 23:02.240
You have to know
what lies beneath this dome

23:02.280 --> 23:04.280
is a symbol of what you mean to me.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.200
Ooh.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.000
As proposals go, I have seen better.

23:12.040 --> 23:15.040
It's not the most romantic thing
to show, a load of old bones.

23:15.080 --> 23:19.960
Excuse me, that's my mother.
Do you mean me? Who are you again?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.240
This should have been...
An apple tart? I ate it.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.960
There was a diamond ring
concealed within.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.120
Your ring has gone
from one tart to another.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.040
Why don't you shut your mouth,
you stuck-up b...?

23:31.080 --> 23:33.280
- Ow!
- Mother!

23:33.320 --> 23:36.240
Calm down, let's put you back in
here.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.320
How are you feeling, Mother?
Are you OK?

23:40.360 --> 23:42.120
How many fingers am I holding up?

23:42.160 --> 23:44.480
Oh, Robert!
I can't see without my glasses.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.440
What did you say?
I said I can't see.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.160
Well, you just called me Robert.
Well, that's your name.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.040
A mother ought to know her son.
Good God. That slap,

23:53.080 --> 23:56.080
it must have brought you back to me.
Oh!

23:56.120 --> 23:58.280
Amber, listen, I do love thee.

23:58.320 --> 24:01.440
She is bewitched,
I cannot break the spell.

24:01.480 --> 24:05.360
Just tell us, Vince, what do we need
to know to make this right?

24:05.400 --> 24:07.960
I'm sleeping now. Good night.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.640
Has he been drinking?
He had a glass of wine.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.960
Urgh!

24:22.000 --> 24:24.480
Then I take matters
into my own hands.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.880
Don't touch me with those trotters,
you fat pig!

24:26.920 --> 24:30.080
With true love's kiss,
I aim to break the spell.

24:34.360 --> 24:35.720
No, don't!

24:35.760 --> 24:37.440
Sorry.
No, I meant don't stop.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.400
I thought she's your girlfriend.
Mother, please.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.280
Poor Gus!
I don't know what came over me.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.920
It wasn't me,
I can promise you that.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.040
I love a happy ending,
don't you, Fred?

24:51.080 --> 24:53.400
In 917, there's an empty bed.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.120
Of this confusion,
I have had my fill.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.040
Excuse me, Miss.
I'd like to pay my bill.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.840
AARRGGHH!

25:06.880 --> 25:08.600
For the final time, will you be...?

25:16.320 --> 25:17.360
What's this?

25:19.800 --> 25:23.280
Two peas from the same pod,
both shelled.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.600
Do my old eyes deceive me,

25:25.640 --> 25:29.720
or could I be looking at
the sons I briefly held?

25:31.920 --> 25:33.400
I was adopted as a child.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.960
And I.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.360
I never knew my father.
Until now.

25:41.360 --> 25:45.120
I pray you, sirs,
do not an old man mock.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.520
We must get to the bottom of this.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.680
How?

25:48.720 --> 25:50.640
The proof, it is behind you.

25:51.960 --> 25:55.920
For my boys both bore
a birthmark on their bare behinds.

25:55.960 --> 25:59.240
It was a most unusual shape.
I know!

25:59.280 --> 26:00.440
It looks just like...

26:00.480 --> 26:02.280
BOTH: ..the chair
from Mastermind!

26:02.320 --> 26:04.240
It's true. I saw it on his bum.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.920
It makes me think
of Magnus Magnusson!

26:06.960 --> 26:09.040
Give me but one moment, I implore.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.880
I won't need
that bath plug any more.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.240
I always felt that I was but a half.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.680
Lacking not just
a father and a mother.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.680
Meeting your other half
makes you a whole.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.480
Does that sound wrong?
It's nice to meet you...

26:32.440 --> 26:34.520
..brother.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.800
Oh!
Lovely!

26:37.680 --> 26:40.840
So, all is resolved.
Just like a theatre play.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.960
And I can get my happy end away.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.440
Not so fast!

26:46.200 --> 26:49.480
Everybody stay
exactly where they are.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.880
I'm sorry to break up
this pretty scene

26:51.920 --> 26:56.120
but I have unfinished business
with Prince Rico.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.840
I pray you, sirs,
which one of you is he?

26:59.880 --> 27:03.280
'Tis I. 'Tis I. 'Tis I.
Mother, calm down!

27:03.320 --> 27:05.840
You have set this up to try to
muddle me.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.800
Step forward, Prince,
or Daddy gets the knife.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.320
That's what you call dramatic irony!

27:11.360 --> 27:13.800
Oh, I know him.
He saw my show tonight.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.320
Please, spare his life
and take me in his place.

27:17.360 --> 27:21.520
I've had enough. The old man
has to die. I'll spill his guts.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.160
Spaghetti bolognese!

27:25.200 --> 27:26.640
Urgh!

27:26.680 --> 27:29.080
# Ooooooh! The hokey cokey!

27:29.120 --> 27:32.000
♪ Oooooh, the hokey cokey... ♪

27:32.040 --> 27:35.400
Vince, you've saved the day.
Thank you, child.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.520
I'm glad that everyone is
reconciled.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.480
I thought I was goner.
No way, Pops.

27:39.520 --> 27:42.040
Let's lock him in his room
and call the cops.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.440
# Left leg out!

27:43.480 --> 27:47.040
♪ In, out, in, out!
Shake it all about! ♪

27:47.080 --> 27:49.480
Can someone tell me
what's gone on today?

27:50.520 --> 27:52.760
It's more than a rhyming
couplet can relay.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.960
I wish you had your diamond ring.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.640
But, hush!

27:58.680 --> 28:00.240
I think that I did hear
a toilet flush.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.240
Oh!

28:06.280 --> 28:07.320
You found it.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.000
Aw!

28:16.880 --> 28:19.000
SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE

28:24.280 --> 28:26.640
I hope you've enjoyed
your stay at Zanzibar.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.880
We're all little older,
if not wiser.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.640

please, tell your friends.
