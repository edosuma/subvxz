What the hell?

00:21.040 --> 00:22.405

00:22.640 --> 00:24.847
- He hit T.J.
- What?!

00:24.960 --> 00:26.371
I found bruises on him,

00:26.440 --> 00:27.851
so I went to my dad's house, and I--

00:27.920 --> 00:30.082
[Dion] Oh, dude, no, no.
You got it all wrong.

In hindsight,
I probably should have mentioned it.

- No.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.807
We've got about $1,240 on account,

11:15.880 --> 11:19.043
and we just cashed
our start-up check for $75,000.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.361
- And, uh, where's that?
- Dion has it.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.762
[Dion] God, yes! I want to have
rough sex with these pans! Whoo!

11:25.080 --> 11:27.924
Hey! Give the receipts to Pilar!

11:28.800 --> 11:30.404
Yes. Receipts.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.487
[chuckles]

11:33.160 --> 11:34.207
So...

11:36.880 --> 11:39.565
I'm re-- I'm-- I'm glad you're here.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.765
- I really should, uh, dive in.
- Yeah. Yes, please.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.969
Um, can I get you anything?
Do you want tea or anything?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.168
Um, no. Thank you.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.571
Okay.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.728
Oh, urn, door closed, please.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.965
Thanks again.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.846
[cellphone vibrating]

12:09.480 --> 12:11.801
<i>Hola, cariño.
- [Pilar] Hey, Blanca.</i>

12:11.880 --> 12:13.211
¿Qué pasa?
You sound funny.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.044
No, I have good news.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.440
Did that wine guy ask you out?

12:16.520 --> 12:19.000
No, but I'm managing his restaurant.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.768
You know nothing about
managing a restaurant.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.410
I know a few things.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.251
I was just wondering...

12:26.800 --> 12:30.122
what does an H...VAC mean?

12:30.200 --> 12:32.248
<i>¡Ay, Dios mío!</i>

12:32.320 --> 12:34.322
Focus on the basics.
Keep track of the money.

12:34.760 --> 12:35.921
And the windows are stationary?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.809
No. Rie's idea was that these were

12:37.880 --> 12:40.201
sliding casement windows
so that--

12:40.320 --> 12:42.163
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is a mistake.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.130
- [Dion] Nope.
- [Tommy] What?

12:44.760 --> 12:46.842
What do we need two walk-ins for?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.160
One is for perishables.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.322
The other one is for curing
and aging our own meat.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.482
That is completely impractical.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.451
Dude, dude, our place is called Thirio,
right, meaning "beast."

12:56.520 --> 12:59.683
Now, if it's called Scallop,
sure, fine, whatever, but it's not.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.081
Besides,
me and Rie already talked this through.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.242
Oh, you and Rie already
talked this through? Where was I?

13:04.320 --> 13:05.367
T., T.,

13:05.560 --> 13:06.721
you are
the most brilliant somm

13:06.800 --> 13:08.211
in the whole
of the five boroughs.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.770
I wouldn't even begin
to tell you what to do

13:09.840 --> 13:12.923
with your wine list.
Just-- just relax, all right?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.604
Look, I got this.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.522
All right, who am I paying around here?
You?

13:21.640 --> 13:22.880
It's all there, man.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.367
[Anna] I get that you're having
a hard time,

13:29.680 --> 13:33.162
but I want you to know
that you're not alone.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.402
Other kids are having
a hard time, too.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.802
Not like you, but they're struggling.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.849
Like, there's the two Liams.

13:41.440 --> 13:46.082
Liam B. with his asthma.
Liam K. has those tantrums.

13:48.840 --> 13:52.561
Andre Walker has a very hard
time controlling his anger.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.642
[guitar music plays]

14:02.560 --> 14:03.846
[construction sounds]

14:03.920 --> 14:05.445
Oh, Tommy?

14:06.120 --> 14:07.201
You know Mose?

14:07.320 --> 14:08.970
- Yeah. Hey.
- Hey.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.408
- We should hire Mose.
- To do...?

14:11.480 --> 14:13.687
- Anything.
- Well, if I can't afford to pay you,

14:13.760 --> 14:15.091
I can't afford to pay him.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.571
We need all the help we can get,

14:16.640 --> 14:19.689
and Mose qualifies for some kind
of privately funded grant.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.730
Veterans with Disabilities
Reintegration Program.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.406
- Meaning...?
- We get paid to have Mose work here.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.204
Welcome to Thirio.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.882
It feels good to be a part of something.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.488
- What is that?
- Oven hood.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.481
- Impressive.
- Yeah, it should be for $9,250.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.848
Hey, is Dion giving you
the receipts?

14:40.920 --> 14:43.207
- I think so.
- Oh! Hey.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.045
Dang! I thought we
were getting the big one!

14:46.520 --> 14:49.091
- Hey, I'm kidding, man. I'm kidding.
- Look, hey, I think-- I think Pilar

14:49.200 --> 14:51.601
should be handling the money, all right?
She is our manager.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.883
- Yeah, it wasn't my idea.
- Hey, she's working for free, man.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.048
See? I told you she digs you.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.451
No, the point is that--

14:58.520 --> 15:00.329
No, the point is that I run the kitchen.

15:00.760 --> 15:01.921
I know what we need.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.684
Look, I have to go through her? No.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.968
- Come on, what's your concern here?
- Well, first of all--

15:06.040 --> 15:08.486
No, no! [laughing] No!

15:09.160 --> 15:11.367
Are you kidding me?!
That's what I'm talking about!

15:11.440 --> 15:12.805
Getting the crew back together!

15:12.920 --> 15:14.365
- Ohh, how you doing?
- [Dion yells]

15:14.440 --> 15:15.851
You know,
I'd walk through fire for you, brother.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.048
Yeah, but you missed
your chance on that one, huh?

15:18.120 --> 15:20.726
[Dion] Laugh it up, man. Laugh it up.
Val! [smooches]

15:20.800 --> 15:22.564
- Listen, I'm nothing without you.
- Hey, Dion.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.483
Look, thanks for doing this, all right?

15:24.560 --> 15:27.131
Are you kidding me?
You're paying me twice what I was making.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.124
Plus, it really helps with me
and Pam trying to have a baby.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.287
Hey, hey, you know,

15:31.360 --> 15:33.840
money's not the only assistance
I can provide, huh?

15:33.960 --> 15:36.645
[chuckles]
That is really very generous of you, Chef.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.165
But, uh, we got that part covered.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.561
- Hey, well, I hear that. I hear that.
- [chuckles]

15:40.960 --> 15:44.123
Okay, all right, listen up,
okay, this is gonna be intense.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.328
We're opening in less than a month.
We got to create a whole new menu.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.368
Oh, man, I live for this shit!

15:48.440 --> 15:49.965
- We're in!
- Yes, Chef! [grunts]

15:50.040 --> 15:51.769
- [Val laughs]
- You know, I'm down, yeah?

15:52.040 --> 15:54.361
But I got to be honest with you
there may be a problem.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.851
- All right?
- I got visa issues.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.724
I can't afford a lawyer right now.
And if it--

15:57.800 --> 15:58.847
- [shushes]

15:59.800 --> 16:01.165
Yeah, you can.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.167

16:03.280 --> 16:04.805
- All right. All right.
- My man.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.521
[clock ticking]

16:14.600 --> 16:16.409
So, what happened at school?

16:23.920 --> 16:25.763
Got your ass handed to you, huh?

16:33.280 --> 16:35.328
Want to learn to defend yourself?

16:39.480 --> 16:40.891
No.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.004
Hit it like you mean it.
You got to put your weight into it.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.491
I fell down an elevator shaft,
and I can hit harder than that.

16:47.560 --> 16:48.891
Hold the bag.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.370
[grunting]

16:56.040 --> 16:57.041
Come on.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.121
[grunts]

17:03.280 --> 17:04.849
[grunts]
Right, you feel that?

17:05.240 --> 17:06.287
[Aidan] That's power.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.641
Tried to teach your father that,
but he didn't want to learn.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.846
[Aidan] You want to learn?

17:10.079 --> 17:11.844
Well, show me you want to learn.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.521
[9 ru nts]

17:23.880 --> 17:26.849

All right,
first comes the dry-aged beef carpaccio

17:39.200 --> 17:41.248
with whipped feta and raw artichoke.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.561
Then brodo with a poached egg
and Parmesan.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.689
And then finally, roasted marrow bones

17:46.880 --> 17:49.486
with oyster mushrooms, orange gremolata,

17:49.640 --> 17:50.971
and sliced steak.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.810
- Damn, son!
- Yeah?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.365
Come on, let's get cooking.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.325
Fiasco, I want to see that
looking paper-thin, right?

17:58.400 --> 17:59.925
- Paper-thin.
- Yes, Chef.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.165
I want it to look nice and fine.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.287
Not too chunky.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.447
Yes, Chef.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.365
Habib, you good?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.245
Hey, you know I love you, brother.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.209
Listen, make sure they're
swimming in marrow, all right?

18:24.280 --> 18:25.327
You know it. Yes, Chef!

18:48.200 --> 18:49.247

18:49.640 --> 18:51.290
don't surprise me like that.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.047
Afghanistan.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.925
[Pilar] Dion, we need to talk.

18:58.960 --> 19:03.727
Why do you need $9,000 worth of pans
and a $4,000 dehumidifier?

19:03.800 --> 19:05.529
And that hood-- I don't understand.

19:05.600 --> 19:06.647
Welcome to my world.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.370
All right, you know what? Taste this.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.002
- Oh, it's good.
- Ah, it's good.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.451
All right, you see,
but "good" is not good enough.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.565
All right, taste this.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.731
- Mmm! Mmm!
- [Dion] Hmm?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.928
- That's fantastic.
- Right.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.771
Now, one is made from
Tommy's skillet from Kmart,

19:37.840 --> 19:42.050
and the other one is made from a $700 pan.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.201
I'm calling this a teachable moment.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.567
- Tommy, you have to try this.
- [cellphone chimes]

Ow!

[tires screech]

20:01.880 --> 20:04.451
[guitar music plays]

20:20.320 --> 20:23.244
So, can I assume you were
on your way to pay me my vig?

20:23.880 --> 20:26.326
Look, it's not due for another three days.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.610
Ten grand?

20:29.280 --> 20:30.361
Impressive.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.885
Yeah, well, at least I'm ahead.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.485
You're not even close to ahead.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.566
Which is why
you're gonna keep this...

20:37.560 --> 20:39.403
in a safe place for me.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.281
Come on, man.
That-- that is not our agreement.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.840
No, our agreement is whatever I say it is.

20:52.840 --> 20:56.322
And if even one flake
of that coke is missing,

20:56.440 --> 20:58.363
I'll take all your teeth.

- What?!
- Tell him.

21:56.720 --> 22:00.042
Out of the 75-plus grand,
there's $230,

22:00.320 --> 22:01.924
plus whatever you have left.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.446
Well, I spent it all on... truffles.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.761
- Jesus, man!
- Where'd it all go?!

22:06.840 --> 22:09.684
On all your big-ticket items!
Your pans, your--

22:09.760 --> 22:13.970
your two walk-ins,
that insanely expensive oven hood!

22:14.040 --> 22:16.247
Oh, oh, maybe you've forgotten,
but Rie wanted that oven hood.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.606
Oh, how convenient.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.967
Yet another discussion
that didn't involve me.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.087
You're the wine guy.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.566
Yeah, well, now I'm a wine guy

22:22.640 --> 22:24.165
who doesn't get any goddamn wine!

22:24.480 --> 22:26.721
Fine, we'll-- we'll put
the money from Aidan to work.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.723
Actually, the next month
of installments

22:28.800 --> 22:30.848
goes to the salaries you promised
your staff.

Wh-- where were you in all of this?

22:34.360 --> 22:36.044
Hey, hey.
Yeah, you're supposed to be our manager!

22:36.120 --> 22:37.884
Hey, don't lay this on her,
okay? Hey!

22:38.160 --> 22:40.731
Hey, you're the one throwing
cash around like confetti.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.768
You know, why do I ever trust you?

You lie, you cheat, you--
you only think about yourself.

Oh, come on, man.
Stop being so over-dramatic.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.603
You sound like a high-school girl.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.724
Look, just let me figure
a way out of this.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.847
Oh, really?
You gonna figure out

22:52.920 --> 22:56.129
how to buy thousands of dollars'
worth of wine with 230 bucks?

22:56.440 --> 22:59.046
Well, you know,
I know a place we can get a ton of wine...

22:59.640 --> 23:01.404
for zero dollars.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.640
Come on, man.

Come on. It's so easy.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.562
No. Frank was a good boss.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.408
You get caught ripping off
a wine warehouse,

23:18.600 --> 23:20.125
they'll put you away for 10 years.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.282
You know what?
Your wine is that important to me, T.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.401
Please, stop.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.809
All right, fine.
Look, you got a better idea?

23:25.880 --> 23:27.564
Yeah, I do--
Why don't you sell back

23:27.640 --> 23:29.449
- some of your equipment?
- Not happening!

23:29.520 --> 23:32.922
All right, God forbid
you don't cure your own prosciutto.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.209
Okay, fine, look, let's-- let's just get
a small-business loan.

23:36.280 --> 23:39.170
Oh, good. Oh, really,
really great thinking because,

23:39.240 --> 23:42.130
yeah, you-- an alcoholic sommelier,

23:42.280 --> 23:45.443
and me-- a felon,
for burning down a restaurant--

23:45.600 --> 23:47.887
go to the Bank of America
to get a loan

23:47.960 --> 23:50.691
to build up a restaurant. In the Bronx!

23:50.760 --> 23:54.128
Oh, yeah, come on, man!
Let's go put on ties!

23:54.200 --> 23:56.089
So, what-- so we steal wine?!

23:56.600 --> 23:59.046
- Who are you?
- I am who and what you signed up for.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.485
Dion, we're not kids anymore.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.091
How do you still think like this?

24:02.160 --> 24:04.208
Yeah, because if we both
don't think like this,

24:04.280 --> 24:06.931
then our restaurant,
it's never gonna happen.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.810
[Dion] Oh, dude.
Dude, you know what?

24:09.880 --> 24:11.484
I am beginning to think that you and I

24:11.560 --> 24:12.925
have a fundamental difference

24:13.000 --> 24:14.650
in how devoted we are to this place.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.330
I'm devoted, just not to the extent that

24:16.440 --> 24:17.726
I'm gonna break the law.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.002
Fine. Yeah, you know what?

24:20.080 --> 24:23.050
We'll open the best restaurant
this side of the Hudson!

24:23.960 --> 24:25.962
Yeah, we'll serve wine out of a box!

24:28.320 --> 24:29.367

[door slams]

24:33.920 --> 24:35.490
[train rattling]

24:58.880 --> 25:00.484
Things any better at school?

25:12.760 --> 25:13.807
Remember our deal.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.451
Something like this happens again,
you come to me, right?

25:17.640 --> 25:19.165
Hmm?

25:24.600 --> 25:26.045
All right.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.124
Sweet dreams.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.605
Love you.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.561
[train rattling]

25:58.720 --> 25:59.846
[police radio chatter]

26:00.840 --> 26:01.887
Call me crazy,

26:01.960 --> 26:04.406
but I don't think this guy
shot himself in the back.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.130
What do we got,
a new turf war here?

26:06.200 --> 26:09.090
My first thought it's fallout
from the Asians' coke getting stolen,

26:09.160 --> 26:11.083
but if I was a betting man,

26:11.200 --> 26:13.885
I'd put my money on
Ziggy Woichik's crew taking it.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.805
[guitar music plays]

26:27.200 --> 26:28.486
[grunts]

26:40.200 --> 26:43.841
The guy at the store said <i>these</i> taste

26:43.920 --> 26:45.843
just like much more expensive wines,

26:46.200 --> 26:48.646
and a few hundred dollars
could buy a lot of them.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.287
[sighs]

26:50.360 --> 26:53.569
Pilar, urn, the quality of the wines is

26:53.640 --> 26:57.167
extremely important
for a high-end restaurant.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.730
Could you at least give it a try?

26:59.160 --> 27:00.207
Sure.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.689
Wait! No. Don't look.

27:04.440 --> 27:05.487
[chuckles]

27:07.880 --> 27:08.927
[quietly] Okay.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.247
Taste this one.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.726
Not bad, right?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.684
[hesitantly] Mm-hmm.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.651
What do you think it is?

27:26.920 --> 27:32.563
An Australian Shiraz from 2011
with an owl on the label, right?

27:35.280 --> 27:36.327
Holy crap.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.720
Okay. You know what?

27:40.280 --> 27:43.443
I want you to try
a Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

27:43.680 --> 27:44.761
Come.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.922
Okay. First...

27:53.320 --> 27:54.606
first we look at the color.

27:54.680 --> 27:59.004
Is it... neon purple or ruby garnet?

27:59.080 --> 28:01.970
Crystal clear or slightly hazy?

28:02.520 --> 28:05.285
Now we swirl the wine,
get some air into it, you know?

28:05.360 --> 28:08.284
Let it stretch its legs,
release some aromatics.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.851
Give it a good swirl.

28:10.080 --> 28:13.209
Now we nose the wine.
It's wine jargon. Y-- you smell it.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.606
What does the wine tell you?

28:18.680 --> 28:21.286
- It's better than my stuff.
- [both chuckle]

28:21.360 --> 28:23.010
You know what? Do it again.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.690
Really breathe it in.

28:24.760 --> 28:25.807
Close your eyes.

28:28.440 --> 28:32.286
Mmm.
Sun-drenched, overripe wild berries.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.842
Dried savory <i>herbes de Provence.</i>

28:37.360 --> 28:40.648
Hints of cedar from neutral, old oak.

28:41.880 --> 28:46.124
And-- and an old-world rusticity, right?

28:47.040 --> 28:49.247
Okay, now we take a good sip.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.567
Wait, wait, wait.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.883
Now, you want to activate all
the taste buds front and back,

28:54.000 --> 28:55.650
top and the sides.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.567
[slurping]

29:05.040 --> 29:07.486
[mid-tempo music plays]

29:14.080 --> 29:15.127
What do you think?

29:15.200 --> 29:17.771
I... think... I want more.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.047
[both chuckle]

29:19.880 --> 29:24.363
[laughing] So, I told my sister
that the greasy guy

29:24.440 --> 29:27.046
with the mullet at the car wash
had the hots for her.

29:27.320 --> 29:31.166
Total lie, but trust me,
Blanca deserved it. [chuckles]

29:31.400 --> 29:33.289
Wait, so, how did she do with mullet man?

29:33.360 --> 29:37.001
- Now he's my brother-in-law. [laughs]
- No.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.326
Listen...

29:44.320 --> 29:46.243
I know we're not paying you
what you're worth

29:46.320 --> 29:47.924
for your management experience.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.369
And I also know that-- that Dion
has been...

29:54.800 --> 29:56.165
A handful.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.561
- [both chuckle]
- You're very polite.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.881
I'm...diplomatic.
[chuckles]

30:01.880 --> 30:03.928
I'm not trying to excuse his behavior,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.368
but h-- he's had it rough.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.690
You mean, um, the prison thing?

30:11.520 --> 30:13.284
Nah, long before that.

30:13.560 --> 30:18.407
When he was 11,
his morn and dad were robbed at gunpoint

30:19.000 --> 30:21.367
in the parking lot behind their diner,

30:21.600 --> 30:22.840
and they were murdered.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.331
Oh, my God.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.966
Yeah.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.001
We were-- we were kids
in the neighborhood together.

30:31.280 --> 30:36.844
And my mom left my dad and me,
uh, when I was a baby.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.601
So Dion and I were--

30:39.680 --> 30:42.570
were both kind of orphans
at the same time.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.327
Oh, but your dad isn't dead.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.330
Well, might as well have been.
[chuckles]

30:48.400 --> 30:50.084
I had no father.

30:50.520 --> 30:55.162
But sometimes sad and lonely
is all it takes for two people to click.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.600
You know, we [chuckles]

30:59.680 --> 31:03.924
We spent a lot of time listening
to records at his uncle's place.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.931
- Boyz ll Men for me.
- [both chuckle]

31:08.000 --> 31:10.480
- Beastie Boys for him.
- [chuckles]

31:11.440 --> 31:13.249
[chuckles]

31:13.320 --> 31:16.802
He Frisbee-threw
my Cooleyhighharmony album

31:16.880 --> 31:19.770
onto the Grand Concourse,
and I punched him in the dick.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.769
- Ohh.
- [both laugh]

31:22.200 --> 31:25.727
<i>I Frisbee-threw his Ill Communication</i>

31:25.800 --> 31:28.770
into the Hudson,
and he punched me in the dick.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.006
[laughs]

31:30.080 --> 31:32.651
You guys, uh,
punch each other in the dick a lot.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.445
[both laugh]

31:35.400 --> 31:36.811
We do.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.603
We're friends, you know?
We fight and we make up.

31:43.920 --> 31:46.048
Please don't let it scare you away.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.360
We need you.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.723
<i>I</i> need you.
I'd like you to stay.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.407
Okay.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.570
I'll stay.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.808
- Good.
- [chuckles]

32:04.680 --> 32:06.125
You're, uh--

32:07.000 --> 32:09.401
You're Boyz ll Men over Beastie Boys,
right?

32:11.320 --> 32:13.368
- Biggie Smalls.
- No!

- Nice.

Where are you?

[Tommy] Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You're not at...

33:19.240 --> 33:20.571
You're at Frank's!

33:20.760 --> 33:23.411
<i>Dion,
I told you absolutely not!</i>

- You're absolutely not involved.
- I'm totally involved.

33:26.520 --> 33:27.646
[stutters] I'm talking to you.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.366
Look, I just need some help trying to find
the wine that you want.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.171
No, I don't want any stolen wine.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.009
Too late, man. We're already here.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.361
<i>[Tommy]
"We"? Who's "we "?</i>

33:37.680 --> 33:40.968
Get out of there, okay?
Just-- just leave right now!

33:41.080 --> 33:43.606
Go!
No, no, no, not that one.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.728
That's-- that's--
That's five years from maturing.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.040
You're five years from maturing.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.248
<i>[Tommy] Wait, wait, wait,
wait, what's-- what's Stavros carrying?</i>

33:49.720 --> 33:52.007
- No, that's crap.
- You don't like what I'm stealing,

33:52.080 --> 33:53.650
you come down here
and get it yourself.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.921
Yeah, he's not wrong, man.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.804
Right, if you're gonna take something,
at least--

33:56.880 --> 33:58.041
at least take some Bordeaux.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.685
- [Dion] You getting that?
- [Starvos] Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.728
Oh, and the, uh-- the Fattoria '07.

No, no, no, that's-- that's the '09.</i>

No, we don't know anything, man.
You're the somm.

Gra-- grab the Châteauneuf.
Yes, that stuff's like a dream.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.971
<i>[Tommy]
Get two cases. Yeah, actually,</i>

34:21.440 --> 34:24.569
- yeah, get four.
- Happy? Huh? Grateful?

34:24.840 --> 34:27.081
You want to tickle my balls
right now, don't you?

Mose, start loading up.

Wait, wait, did anybody get my grappa?

34:36.440 --> 34:38.726
- Oh, forget your grappa.
- I'm getting my damn grappa.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.245
Fine, we'll get your grappa.

Hey! What are you doing here?

34:45.440 --> 34:48.728
[groans, gasps for air]

34:50.480 --> 34:53.210
Mose, man! What did you do?

34:54.440 --> 34:55.851
He surprised me.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.929
2003 red Bottini, retails at...

35:07.800 --> 35:09.165
About $350.

35:09.240 --> 35:13.962
And I offer it to you at the low,
low price of, hmm, free.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.965
Dude, what's wrong?

35:19.360 --> 35:22.682
We're here to celebrate, baby.
We're on our way. What's the matter?

35:22.760 --> 35:24.922
[groans] Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy about the wine.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.207
It's just, you know, Frank.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.169
Oh, Frank's insurance will cover the cost.

35:29.240 --> 35:30.890
You know, he probably doubled the claim.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.883
You know what?
We actually did him a favor.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.770
- [cellphone ringing]
- Maybe.

35:38.640 --> 35:39.971
Hello?

35:40.560 --> 35:42.210
Oh, hey, Blake. What...?

35:43.040 --> 35:44.166
No.

35:45.960 --> 35:46.961
What?

35:47.920 --> 35:49.001
Jesus, what-- ?

35:49.520 --> 35:52.205
Th-- that's terrible.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.362
No, um-- No. Thank you.

35:54.880 --> 35:55.927
Later.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.040
What?

35:59.800 --> 36:02.041
Did you happen to leave
anything out when you told me

36:02.160 --> 36:04.083
about your little wine adventure?

36:04.160 --> 36:05.241
No. What you talking about?

36:05.320 --> 36:08.642
- Any, I don't know, horrific details?
- No, what?

36:08.720 --> 36:10.802
- Wait, who was that?
- That was a wine-rep friend.

36:10.880 --> 36:15.204
Apparently, there was a big
robbery at Frank's warehouse,

36:15.280 --> 36:17.487
and, uh, somebody got hurt... bad.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.164
Randy, the security guy?

36:20.280 --> 36:22.442
Yeah, oh, that. Yeah, that...

36:22.520 --> 36:24.807
- Yeah, that was unfortunate.
- Unfortunate?

36:25.840 --> 36:28.571
Randy's got a collapsed trachea
and a shattered kneecap.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.364
That's called collateral damage.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.487
This is not okay.

36:31.680 --> 36:33.045
Trust me, he'll live, all right?

36:33.120 --> 36:35.248
The important thing
is that we got our wine.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.644
Damn it, Dion!

36:39.000 --> 36:40.047
We're not criminals!

36:40.240 --> 36:41.924
This is the kind of shit
my dad does!

36:42.040 --> 36:43.087
But he's successful!

36:44.680 --> 36:47.251
T., opening a restaurant in the Bronx

36:47.320 --> 36:49.004
is not exactly an easy proposition.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.566
You know, if we're gonna make it,

36:50.640 --> 36:52.688
you know, we may-- we may have
to get our hands dirty.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.842
I'm not talking about
getting our hands dirty.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.684
I'm talking about almost killing a guy.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.931
Oh, so it's okay to steal
$100,000 worth of wine.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.889
It's okay to take
your dad's dirty money,

37:02.960 --> 37:05.247
but, oh, if poor, schmucky Randy
gets his leg broken,

37:05.320 --> 37:07.402
then, what, suddenly,
you have a conscience? No.

37:07.480 --> 37:08.606
Yes!

37:09.760 --> 37:11.250
All right, fine.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.681
Let's talk to Randy.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.643
Oh, hello. Is that Randy?

37:18.120 --> 37:21.522
Oh, good. Good.
'Cause screw you, Randy!

37:22.240 --> 37:23.241
[scoffs]

37:24.360 --> 37:25.930
Yeah, go on. Say it.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.202
[chuckles] No.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.089
Yeah, if Randy is what stands between us

37:30.280 --> 37:33.489
and our restaurant, say it.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.130
- Stupid.
- [Dion] Oh, really?

37:36.640 --> 37:39.291
What, you, uh, you--
you don't want to do this restaurant?

37:39.400 --> 37:40.447
[scoffs]

37:41.240 --> 37:42.287
Say it.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.927
Screw you, Randy. Okay?

37:49.000 --> 37:51.207
No. Come here. Come here.

37:52.280 --> 37:53.441
Take a look at this.

37:53.920 --> 37:57.163
Huh? Look at all that wine, bro.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.127
[Dion] It's all ours.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.161
It's for the restaurant.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.807
Now... say it like you mean it.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.406
Screw you, Randy.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.564
Yeah, Randy was gonna crush Rie's dream.

38:17.920 --> 38:21.891
- <i>Screw</i> you, Randy.
- All our sketches, all our hard work,

38:21.960 --> 38:23.450
you having to crawl back
to your dad--

38:23.520 --> 38:24.646
All of that would have been for nothing.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.882
Screw you, Randy,

38:26.960 --> 38:30.567
you stupid son of a bi--
You waste of space!

38:30.640 --> 38:31.687
Why don't you just 90"

38:31.760 --> 38:32.841
Okay, okay, we-- we got it.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.048
We got it. Good.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.210
Hey, T., look at me.

38:40.760 --> 38:43.161
Nothing's gonna stop us. Hmm?

38:43.680 --> 38:45.125
Nothing.

38:49.600 --> 38:53.002
[guitar music plays]

38:53.600 --> 38:55.921
[school bell rings,
indistinct conversations]

38:58.600 --> 39:00.409
Have one of your parents call me, okay?

39:01.440 --> 39:04.523
[boy] It'll have to be my dad.
My mom's in jail.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.604
Okay.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.444
- Hey, yo, what the hell?
- A Mexican gal let me in.

39:23.840 --> 39:28.368
So, word on the street
is someone stole the Asian coke shipment.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.967
What, the coke shipment that--
that I told you about.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.690
Our mutual friend's got it, right?

39:32.920 --> 39:33.967
Couldn't say.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.091
I'm thinking he does,

39:36.160 --> 39:38.686
and he's too smart to put it
on the street right now.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.089
But nobody keeps cocaine
as a hobby,

39:41.280 --> 39:43.248
and when he sells it,
there's gonna be a lot of cash.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.721
I need to find out where
he's laundering his money.

39:47.400 --> 39:48.845
What do you expect me
to do about it?

39:48.920 --> 39:52.049
Get in closer with him.
Keep your ear to the ground.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.007
[mid-tempo music plays]

39:57.200 --> 39:59.407
I swear to God, I am this close.

40:07.640 --> 40:10.928
<i>I have three businesses ready
to sign leases on the new lot.</i>

40:11.080 --> 40:12.411
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

40:12.800 --> 40:14.211
[Woichik Jr.] And I'm happy to report

40:14.280 --> 40:16.328
<i>I received a very nice payment
from Dion Patras.</i>

40:16.400 --> 40:21.725
And the Chinese food
is divided and well-hidden.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.041
[Woichik Sr.] Good.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.885
<i>As for the territory of the South Bronx...</i>

40:27.560 --> 40:28.607
[screaming]

40:29.960 --> 40:31.485
[muffled shouting]

40:35.680 --> 40:36.727
[speaks Polish]

40:37.720 --> 40:38.926
[muffled shouting]

40:46.440 --> 40:47.965
[horns honking in the distance]

40:49.160 --> 40:51.640
[guitar music plays]

40:59.040 --> 41:00.644
Hey, Dion, come here.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.131
Come here. Look at this.

41:02.480 --> 41:03.527
Look.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.644
We're bringing it to life.

41:09.240 --> 41:12.722
And these wines, my God.
Okay, um, here. Here.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.401
Taste this.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.487
Right? And now this.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.210
- Oh, my God. My God.
- [laughs]

41:26.280 --> 41:28.521
- Where'd the tart come from?
- Preserved lemon.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.170
- Val added it to the braised rabbit.
- Mmm!

41:30.240 --> 41:32.163
Meshes right in with that Riesling.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.368
- Insane, right?
- Oh, no, really, that-- that--

41:34.480 --> 41:35.481
that is close to perfect.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.881
Tommy? Your dad's here.

41:40.240 --> 41:41.480
Why are you here?

41:42.240 --> 41:43.969
To introduce Kevin,

41:45.120 --> 41:46.531
your Chef.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.530
Dion's the chef.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.690
You don't get to just show up
and say who does what.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.410
The contract you signed says I can.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.523
Wait-- wait, is that true?

41:55.600 --> 41:57.841
I told you there were
issues with the contract,

41:57.920 --> 41:59.809
and you said they'd go away.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.451
Dion Patras, right?

42:06.520 --> 42:08.443
It's an honor to have you working for me.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.921
Let's get started.
