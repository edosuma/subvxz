01:05.315 --> 01:06.817
<i>This is a routine pursuit.</i>

01:06.984 --> 01:10.487
<i>Main Force repeats,
this is a routine pursuit. Code 44.</i>

01:10.863 --> 01:12.739
<i>Listen, you tell them we need help.</i>

01:12.781 --> 01:15.075
<i>This should be an open-code blitz
and you know it.</i>

01:15.117 --> 01:16.910
<i>You have your information.</i>

01:17.119 --> 01:19.705
<i>Come on, sweetheart,
this one's a heavyweight!</i>

01:19.788 --> 01:22.291
<i>Main Force repeats,
you have your information.</i>

01:22.374 --> 01:25.711
<i>This is a routine pursuit.
Please liaise with Big Bopper.</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:30.799
<i>Jesus, March Hare to Big Bopper.
Assist on Code 3 Red Alert.</i>

01:32.384 --> 01:34.595
Big Bopper. Gotcha, Hare.
What's going down?

01:34.678 --> 01:37.472
<i>- We've got a cop-killer.
- You're kidding!</i>

01:41.101 --> 01:42.311
<i>Be warned, Sarse...</i>

01:42.436 --> 01:44.062
<i>... this is non-compliance.</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:46.481
<i>The Main Force will not tolerate
such action.</i>

01:48.775 --> 01:50.819
<i>This pursuit is designated
a standard Code 44.</i>

01:50.903 --> 01:52.779
<i>Please respond only to that code.</i>

01:52.821 --> 01:56.158
<i>Code 44 indicates no requirement
for a blockade.</i>

01:56.241 --> 01:58.368
<i>A Pursuit Special has been stolen.</i>

01:58.452 --> 02:01.872
<i>Hall Captain Fifi Macaffee
doesn't like this any more than you.</i>

02:02.331 --> 02:05.792
<i>However, we must not compromise
territorial range.</i>

02:06.418 --> 02:09.253
<i>Remember that
only by following instructions...</i>

02:09.420 --> 02:12.591
<i>... can we hope to maintain
a successful highway program.</i>

02:14.426 --> 02:15.928
<i>March Hare to Big Bopper.</i>

02:15.969 --> 02:18.639
<i>We're three minutes off the intersection.
Can you make it?</i>

02:18.722 --> 02:20.474
We'll make it! Move over!

02:20.807 --> 02:22.017
I'm driving!

02:22.643 --> 02:24.895
Not this again! I've been assigned!

02:27.189 --> 02:30.776
Hang on. I'm supposed to drive this crate!

02:35.113 --> 02:37.783
Hey, Sarse, what's the form on this thing?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.535
<i>A twisto bikey, scoot jockey.</i>

02:39.618 --> 02:42.162
<i>A few hours ago, down in Sun City,
he goes berserk.</i>

02:42.538 --> 02:46.291
<i>Breaks custody, wastes a young premmie
and takes off in a Pursuit Special.</i>

02:46.333 --> 02:48.335
<i>We've been on him ever since.</i>

02:48.377 --> 02:50.254
<i>This one's right up the air, Roop.</i>

02:50.337 --> 02:52.798
I've seen the style before.
Terminal psychotic.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.849
What's he driving?

03:01.890 --> 03:04.309
<i>That's what hurts. It's one of our V8s.</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:07.354
<i>Pursuit Special on methane. Very toey!</i>

03:16.405 --> 03:20.492
We're about half a mile off Anarchy Road.
You'll see him any minute now.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.331
Rip the guts out of it. Give it the B-Jesus!

03:31.545 --> 03:32.880
See him yet?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.256
Got it!

03:36.008 --> 03:38.010
I'm gonna blow him away!

03:38.886 --> 03:40.721
I'm gonna ram him!

04:01.783 --> 04:03.702
Hey, fellas, you okay?

04:04.411 --> 04:07.372
<i>Acknowledge, Big Bopper.
Acknowledge, are you okay?</i>

04:09.958 --> 04:12.252
Do you see me, Toecutter?

04:12.628 --> 04:14.713
Do you see me, man?

04:17.466 --> 04:20.552
Keep going, we're okay.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.180
We got you, we're going.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.895
Born with a steering wheel in his hand...

04:30.270 --> 04:32.231
<i>... and lead in his foot.</i>

04:32.314 --> 04:34.608
<i>He is the Nightrider...</i>

04:34.942 --> 04:38.320
<i>... cruising at the speed of fright!</i>

04:39.446 --> 04:43.951
<i>I am the Nightrider,
and we ain't never coming back!</i>

04:45.744 --> 04:49.581
<i>I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine!</i>

04:50.457 --> 04:53.794
<i>I am a rocker! I am a roller!</i>

04:55.128 --> 04:56.797
I think we're still mobile.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.924
For Christ's sake, shove over!

04:59.091 --> 05:00.801
You're blaspheming again.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.387
I don't have to work with a blasphemer.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.225
<i>I am the Nightrider!</i>

05:16.191 --> 05:19.486
Big Bopper to March Hare.
We're still in the game, okay?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.196
<i>Understand this.</i>

05:21.321 --> 05:23.156
That scag and his floozy...

05:24.074 --> 05:25.450
...they're gonna die!

05:33.167 --> 05:37.045
<i>Main Force to Gosling One.
Code 44, standard pursuit. Please respond.</i>

05:37.129 --> 05:39.298
<i>MFP to Gosling One.</i>

05:40.174 --> 05:42.134
<i>Main Force to Gosling One.</i>

05:42.301 --> 05:43.760
It was like slow motion.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.305
He leaves his seat
and goes through the windscreen...

05:46.388 --> 05:48.473
...headfirst straight into the tree, right?

05:48.515 --> 05:51.351
And then bounces back
through the windscreen.

05:52.853 --> 05:56.023
By the time we got to him,
he was just sitting there...

05:56.106 --> 05:59.109
...trying to scream with his face ripped off.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.696
What's the matter?

06:02.738 --> 06:04.198
Not hungry, am I?

06:04.531 --> 06:05.824
Give it here.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.077
- I'll tell you what"..."
- Look at that.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.164
- Christ!
- Strewth, at it again.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.750
Catch you later, Goose.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.655
<i>Christ, they're heading for population!</i>

07:00.838 --> 07:03.048
What's this I hear about you and Jonathan?

07:03.131 --> 07:06.009
- What about him?
- You were seen with him two nights ago.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.302
So what?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.641
It's this way.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.578
He's gone.

07:32.661 --> 07:33.662
Bastards!

07:35.664 --> 07:36.915
Shit!

07:37.291 --> 07:38.959
You're gonna get it this time.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.211
- He had his indicator on.
- Shut up!

07:45.507 --> 07:48.677
No, you're not going on. Stay off the road!

07:48.760 --> 07:50.596
Of course, I'm going on. Shut up!

07:50.637 --> 07:52.723
People's lives are in peril!

07:54.975 --> 07:56.602
Stay off the roads!

08:00.939 --> 08:02.608
I'm gonna have him!

08:04.902 --> 08:06.570
Stay off the roads!

08:08.697 --> 08:09.698
Get off the roads!

08:09.781 --> 08:12.117
- I got him! Shut up!
- Stay off the roads!

08:23.045 --> 08:24.046
Oh, my God.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.778
<i>I am ready.</i>

08:47.861 --> 08:49.821
<i>I am ready for your best.</i>

08:51.615 --> 08:52.908
Oh, my God, what happened?

08:53.033 --> 08:55.661
I don't know, man. I just got here myself.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.163
I think he broke his leg.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.165
I want to find out what's happening.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.708
<i>Max, can you hear me?</i>

09:01.792 --> 09:03.418
Main Force Patrol...

09:04.044 --> 09:05.504
...we're out of the game...

09:05.587 --> 09:07.798
...unable to continue pursuit.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.385
You'd better send a meat truck.
Charlie's copped the saucer in the throat.

09:11.552 --> 09:12.678
Hey, Max?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.098
<i>Max?</i>

09:16.181 --> 09:17.349
Go ahead.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.352
<i>We are 100 percent SNAFUed.</i>

09:20.561 --> 09:21.770
You okay, Goose?

09:21.937 --> 09:24.523
Nothing a year in the tropics wouldn't fix.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.024
Much damage?

09:28.485 --> 09:31.113
<i>You should see the damage, Bronze!</i>

09:31.572 --> 09:32.698
Metal damage...

09:32.781 --> 09:33.907
<i>... brain damage?</i>

09:33.991 --> 09:35.409
<i>You listening, Bronze?</i>

09:35.701 --> 09:38.036
I am the Nightrider!

09:40.455 --> 09:43.834
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.296
<i>I am a rocker! I am a roller!</i>

09:47.754 --> 09:50.632
<i>I am an out-of-controller!</i>

09:52.342 --> 09:54.261
I am the Nightrider, baby...

09:54.845 --> 09:59.057
<i>... and it's me and my Marmaduke,
and we ain't never coming back.</i>

10:16.116 --> 10:18.785
The Toecutter, he knows who I am.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.830
I am the Nightrider!

10:28.045 --> 10:32.049
I am the chosen one,
the mighty hand of vengeance...

10:32.132 --> 10:35.093
<i>... sent down to strike the unroadworthy!</i>

10:36.386 --> 10:38.889
I'm hotter than a rolling dice.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.767
Step right up, chum, and watch the kid...

10:41.850 --> 10:45.437
...lay down a rubber road right to freedom!

11:24.726 --> 11:26.436
What's wrong?

11:29.523 --> 11:31.900
- Baby, what's wrong!
- Nothing.

11:44.705 --> 11:45.747
It's going.

11:45.831 --> 11:48.750
There'll be nothing left. It's all gone.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.343
Stop!

12:57.528 --> 12:59.488
That feels good.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.075
After three days, that feels so good.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.705
I got a right hook in the mouth
this morning.

13:08.789 --> 13:09.957
Sprog?

13:10.207 --> 13:12.626
I told him to always lead with his left.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.963
You know, I think we've got
a monster on our hands.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.340
Yeah, takes after his old man.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.424
What's that?

13:19.925 --> 13:21.134
Monster!

13:22.636 --> 13:25.347
<i>Montazano, who called himself
the Nightrider...</i>

13:25.430 --> 13:29.142
<i>... had broken from custody
and escaped in the police vehicle.</i>

13:29.226 --> 13:31.186
You made the news again.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.273
Who was he?

13:34.356 --> 13:35.399
I don't know.

13:36.525 --> 13:39.027
Just another glory rider, I guess.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.637
Jessie, I told you.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.639
The Goose wants me there early.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.141
What for, he didn't say.

14:09.183 --> 14:10.851
You know the Goose.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.312
Coffee's ready.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.004
I'm not grumpy.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.721
Get out of here.

14:50.891 --> 14:51.850
Okay.

14:52.643 --> 14:53.894
I gotta go.

15:16.792 --> 15:18.210
What's that?

15:19.878 --> 15:21.505
Crazy about you.

15:40.107 --> 15:43.861
<i>All supplies must be requisitioned
from the people's bond.</i>

15:43.944 --> 15:48.907
<i>Please do not exploit your privileges.
Doing so is an offense.</i>

15:49.700 --> 15:51.368
<i>Memorandum Seven:</i>

15:51.535 --> 15:54.746
<i>The Captains of the Hall have
asked that pursuit officers...</i>

15:54.872 --> 15:59.251
<i>... refrain from using the slang "Bronze"
for the Main Force Patrol.</i>

15:59.418 --> 16:01.837
<i>The word is considered disrespectful...</i>

16:01.920 --> 16:05.591
<i>... and citizens should be
actively discouraged from its use.</i>

16:08.302 --> 16:09.928
<i>Memorandum Eight.</i>

16:10.304 --> 16:12.973
<i>Hospital vouchers are available again.</i>

16:13.098 --> 16:17.102
<i>MFP personnel may sign on
with the following sector captains.</i>

16:17.269 --> 16:21.607
<i>One, six three, two four, one one two...</i>

16:21.648 --> 16:24.109
<i>... five seven, and two six.</i>

16:25.694 --> 16:27.779
Kick it in the guts, Barry.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.745
She's the last of the V8s.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.665
You can shut the gate on this one.
It's the duck's guts.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.459
Yeah, she's the last of the V8s.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.960
Sucks nitro.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.420
Phase 4 head.

16:43.629 --> 16:46.006
- Twin overhead cam.
- Tell him about the blower.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.300
- 600 horsepower.
- The blower, man.

16:49.009 --> 16:53.138
She's meanness put to music
and the bitch is born to run.

16:53.514 --> 16:55.849
- He's in a coma, man!
- He loves it.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.865
How the hell did you get all this together?

17:13.075 --> 17:14.867
It just happened, Max, you know?

17:14.952 --> 17:17.788
A piece from here and a piece from there.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.249
- So easy?
- Yeah.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.085
Come on, Max. You've seen it.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.837
You've heard it...

17:24.877 --> 17:27.506
...and you're still asking questions.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.803
When do we go for a ride?

17:35.848 --> 17:37.349
<i>He loves it.</i>

17:38.183 --> 17:39.601
I think we've got him.

17:39.685 --> 17:40.894
I hope so.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.896
Yeah, we've got him.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.190
Your top pursuit man wants
to quit the road...

17:45.274 --> 17:47.943
...and we have to seduce him with candy?

17:48.110 --> 17:50.696
People don't believe in heroes anymore.

17:50.779 --> 17:54.491
I know, Macaffee. You want
to give them back their heroes.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.869
You will not try this one on me again.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.871
I do not enjoy wasting money.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.247
Goodbye...

18:01.039 --> 18:02.666
...and good luck!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.335
Thanks, Labatouche.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.088
You're a real human being.

18:35.616 --> 18:36.867
Get out of my way!

18:36.950 --> 18:39.161
The old meat grinder's humming tonight?

18:39.244 --> 18:42.706
Yeah, Max took out a couple of crazies
over the high side.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.126
Will you shut up!

18:47.628 --> 18:50.255
The hot mops and the towees.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.258
It's in the food.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.177
Another one for your books, eh?

18:55.260 --> 18:56.512
Have you eaten yet?

18:56.595 --> 18:59.181
No, not yet. I'll pick up something later.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.433
That Code 3 you ran down
a few days ago"..."

19:01.517 --> 19:03.560
- The Nightrider?
- The Nightrider, yeah.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.312
- Got a problem.
- What's that?

19:05.395 --> 19:07.523
His friends. Word is they're out to get you.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.775
- Scoot jockeys?
- Yeah, nomad trash.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.611
Well, I'll add it to my threat collection.

19:12.694 --> 19:15.155
Good boy, Max. You're a good boy.

21:14.608 --> 21:15.859
Good afternoon.

21:16.944 --> 21:18.362
Good afternoon.

21:18.946 --> 21:22.449
We're here to meet a friend.
Come in on the train.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.954
Nothing come in on the train
except a couple of crates and a...

21:27.454 --> 21:28.789
...coffin.

21:30.082 --> 21:31.458
Our friend.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.295
You'll have to see the agent
and sign the papers.

21:35.963 --> 21:37.422
Where do we find...

21:37.631 --> 21:38.882
...this agent?

21:41.301 --> 21:42.302
Wait.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.112
That must be your friend there.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.030
Didn't leave much of him.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.783
Must have cut his heart out?

22:08.662 --> 22:10.747
Yes, that's what I meant.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.543
Poor bastard.

22:15.669 --> 22:18.255
The Nightrider.

22:19.965 --> 22:21.633
That is his name.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.220
The Nightrider.

22:26.180 --> 22:27.890
The Nightrider.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.434
Remember him...

22:30.767 --> 22:33.187
...when you look at the night sky.

22:34.479 --> 22:35.939
I will.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.026
Take your hat off.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.502
Anything you say.

22:56.710 --> 22:58.629
Anything I say.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.674
What a wonderful philosophy you have.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.551
Take him away.

23:13.727 --> 23:15.395
Bubba. Johnny.

24:00.524 --> 24:02.359
Push me, shove you!

24:02.442 --> 24:03.944
Oh, yeah? Says who?

24:26.258 --> 24:27.342
Nightrider!

24:29.636 --> 24:31.263
Nightrider!

24:34.474 --> 24:35.434
Nightrider!

25:18.769 --> 25:20.187
No worries.

27:12.341 --> 27:14.718
Anyway, my name is Jim Goose.

27:16.178 --> 27:17.387
Rockatansky.

27:17.429 --> 27:19.431
<i>We have incident at Wee Jerusalem.</i>

27:19.556 --> 27:21.600
<i>Nomad bikers, bulk trouble.</i>

27:21.934 --> 27:24.228
Okay, we're on it. We gone.

27:24.895 --> 27:26.396
Goose, come on.

27:33.028 --> 27:34.446
What's this?

27:34.571 --> 27:36.949
It's a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.758
<i>- Any more details?
- No.</i>

27:56.927 --> 27:58.554
Okay, we're gone.

28:00.806 --> 28:02.641
- Max, he looks"..."
- Yeah.

28:06.728 --> 28:08.355
Hey, fella, stop!

28:13.902 --> 28:15.404
<i>Hey, fella, stop!</i>

28:17.614 --> 28:19.074
What a turkey!

28:20.075 --> 28:22.911
<i>Hey, fella, you're a turkey, you know that?</i>

28:23.662 --> 28:26.832
We'll come back for him later.
There's more up ahead.

28:29.585 --> 28:32.588
Nightrider. My "Niqueur."

28:40.137 --> 28:43.265
<i>Pursuit units in sectors,
eight, nine and ten.</i>

28:46.977 --> 28:49.188
<i>A cyclecade of nomad bikers.</i>

28:49.271 --> 28:51.231
<i>A fast run out of Wee Jerusalem.</i>

28:51.481 --> 28:55.319
<i>Your instructions are to locate.
Do not engage.</i>

28:58.822 --> 29:01.783
<i>Sector Eight. Nomad bikers.</i>

29:06.747 --> 29:07.956
Bronze!

29:09.249 --> 29:10.751
Gonna get you!

29:12.961 --> 29:14.046
It's okay.

29:15.130 --> 29:17.633
It's all right. No one's gonna hurt you.

29:18.175 --> 29:19.259
It's all right.

29:19.343 --> 29:21.428
This one's whacked out of his skull.

29:21.512 --> 29:23.680
Whacked right out of his skull, man!

29:23.764 --> 29:25.849
He ain't never coming back.

29:37.236 --> 29:39.822
It's all right.

29:41.949 --> 29:43.784
I'm gonna let this go now.

29:47.704 --> 29:49.873
I know you're frightened, girl...

29:50.249 --> 29:52.918
...but no one's gonna hurt you anymore.

29:53.919 --> 29:57.506
My name's Jim Goose,
and everything's gonna be all right.

30:11.812 --> 30:13.438
The Nightrider!

30:13.897 --> 30:15.274
Hey, Jimbo.

30:16.608 --> 30:18.944
- Remember that Code 3?
- Yeah.

30:19.653 --> 30:21.947
Remember him when you look up"..."

30:25.242 --> 30:26.577
Nightrider!

30:28.620 --> 30:30.956
Well, well, well.

30:55.230 --> 30:57.816
Johnny the Boy has done it again.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.235
This time it's a scrubber.

31:01.111 --> 31:03.030
He's never gonna learn.

31:04.823 --> 31:07.367
But we are going to teach him, Bubba.

31:07.451 --> 31:09.536
You are going back for him.

31:10.287 --> 31:12.915
No way! Not me, not for him!

31:13.916 --> 31:15.417
But it's not for him.

31:16.084 --> 31:17.711
It's for me, Bubba.

31:25.177 --> 31:27.679
You're wasting your time!
The Scag don't rate!

31:27.763 --> 31:30.140
He's nothing like the Nightrider!

31:52.162 --> 31:53.997
<i>Code seven progress, eight one.</i>

31:54.164 --> 31:56.041
<i>Code seven progress, eight three.</i>

31:56.124 --> 31:59.044
<i>Code seven eight six, eight one, eight zero.</i>

<i>Code one progress.</i>

32:24.778 --> 32:26.155
Hey, mister.

32:26.405 --> 32:28.407
What happened to the car?

32:28.866 --> 32:30.868
What do you think happened?

32:31.493 --> 32:34.037
Looks like it was chewed up and spat out.

32:35.247 --> 32:37.833
Perhaps it's the result of an anxiety.

32:38.959 --> 32:40.252
Hey, Roop.

32:40.961 --> 32:42.296
Stay here, mate.

32:50.846 --> 32:53.307
<i>I think they're out there.</i>

32:53.849 --> 32:56.810
Take your time, Charlie.
We got plenty of it.

32:57.019 --> 32:58.854
<i>Good day and good luck.</i>

33:00.814 --> 33:04.276
<i>I can see the Interceptor.</i>

33:10.908 --> 33:12.534
What do you say, Scag?

33:12.659 --> 33:14.620
Got no place special to go?

33:15.412 --> 33:17.247
<i>We'd better prep him.</i>

33:17.664 --> 33:20.083
Scag, did you bring your toothbrush?

33:23.295 --> 33:25.339
- You'll have to sit on the Goose.
- Why?

33:25.380 --> 33:26.757
No contest.

33:45.651 --> 33:47.194
Hey, Fif! What's going on?

33:47.277 --> 33:48.862
- What happened?
- Let him go.

33:48.946 --> 33:50.906
What's he mean, "Let him go"?
Who's this?

33:50.989 --> 33:52.574
- Keep out of this.
- What's going on?

33:52.658 --> 33:53.992
No one showed, okay?

33:54.326 --> 33:56.787
Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go.

33:57.579 --> 33:59.248
No one showed. No one.

33:59.373 --> 34:01.375
What's he mean, "No one showed"?

34:01.458 --> 34:03.001
They didn't show.

34:03.085 --> 34:05.337
Nobody! The punks didn't show.

34:05.420 --> 34:08.382
The girl didn't show,
the townspeople didn't show.

34:08.590 --> 34:10.132
Nobody showed!

34:10.592 --> 34:12.302
We're screwed! It's the law.

34:12.386 --> 34:15.264
What do you mean, "No one showed"?
Where were you, man?

34:15.304 --> 34:18.183
It means, old man, you haven't got a case.
No contest.

34:18.266 --> 34:21.353
Jesus Christ! You're not gonna
let him walk out the door, Fifi?

34:21.436 --> 34:23.522
That's exactly what you're going to do!

34:23.605 --> 34:25.940
- Shut up!
- Keep going, Charlie!

34:26.859 --> 34:28.193
It's alright.

34:28.277 --> 34:32.239
Hey, Bronze, look at you,
a cripple and a mute!

34:32.281 --> 34:35.324
Scag, he sings and I tap dance!

34:36.618 --> 34:38.871
Hey, you know what you are?

34:38.996 --> 34:42.833
The courts will hear about this.
I promise they'll hear about this disgrace.

34:42.916 --> 34:46.545
He wearing that face for a bet
or does he really look that stupid?

34:46.628 --> 34:48.380
This man is grossly offensive!

34:48.630 --> 34:50.090
Get him out of here, Max!

34:50.132 --> 34:52.885
- I can make a case of it!
- What case, you fool?

34:52.967 --> 34:54.887
You saw what they did to that girl!

34:54.969 --> 34:57.347
For God's sake, she was the town bike!

35:00.309 --> 35:03.228
He's my prisoner,
and he's not walking out that door!

35:03.312 --> 35:05.647
- Get him out of here!
- Who is this guy?

35:05.731 --> 35:07.691
Goose, settle down, boy.

35:11.320 --> 35:12.321
Jesus, Fifi.

35:12.905 --> 35:14.156
Fifi, Jesus.

35:14.323 --> 35:16.241
Look, they're laughing at us!

35:16.325 --> 35:19.953
Can't you see they're laughing at us?
They don't believe us!

35:22.456 --> 35:24.249
See you later, Goose.

35:24.958 --> 35:26.752
It's been a pleasure.

35:53.862 --> 35:57.324
Skiffington, go home. Go.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.201
Goose!

35:59.660 --> 36:01.537
You can't do anything about it!

36:01.745 --> 36:04.164
We know who you are, Bronze!

36:04.206 --> 36:06.208
We'll see you on the road, Scag!

36:06.250 --> 36:08.836
See you on the road
like we saw the Nightrider!

36:09.253 --> 36:13.507
We remember the Nightrider,
and we know who you are!

36:20.472 --> 36:21.473
Okay.

36:22.307 --> 36:26.854
So long as the paperwork is clean,
you boys can do what you like out there.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.527
Here he is, the walking armpit!

36:44.163 --> 36:47.291
There's a fire in my belly,
and she's the woman to put it out.

36:47.374 --> 36:50.586
Off, brute!
This angel is hot in the tubes for me!

36:55.757 --> 36:57.843
I'm on fire!

36:58.093 --> 37:00.053
Joviality is a game of children.

37:00.137 --> 37:04.099
- She's mine.
- I should be a surgeon with these hands.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.981
Mudguts, get out of there!

37:13.483 --> 37:16.320
Cundalini, put her against the post.

37:22.659 --> 37:24.495
We have a problem here.

37:25.078 --> 37:28.123
She is not what she seems.

37:28.832 --> 37:31.919
Bubba Zanetti has it on good authority...

37:32.461 --> 37:35.923
...she's sent by the Bronze,
full of treachery.

37:41.094 --> 37:43.931
The Bronze, take our pride.

37:55.484 --> 37:59.071
If you're gonna waste the Bronze,
you gotta do it big!

37:59.446 --> 38:03.116
You just don't have the style,
do you, chicken shit?

38:05.577 --> 38:08.288
Goes to water on a dummy.

38:21.927 --> 38:24.388
It's all right. It's okay.

38:27.140 --> 38:29.518
Just remember...

38:30.519 --> 38:32.479

43:41.872 --> 43:45.584
You're a lucky boy. Not even a road rash.

43:46.376 --> 43:47.961
Hey, Midge...

43:48.545 --> 43:52.549
...don't write off the Goose,

43:53.634 --> 43:56.053
Yeah, well, don't wreck me truck now.

43:56.136 --> 43:59.139
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- Yeah, no hurry.

Light me, Johnny.

45:54.838 --> 45:56.298
Light another.

46:02.095 --> 46:05.140
This is a threshold moment, Johnny.
Step through.

46:05.265 --> 46:07.684
Toecutter, this isn't what I want.

46:08.477 --> 46:09.645
Light it!

46:15.025 --> 46:18.779
The Bronze,
they keep you from being proud.

46:19.530 --> 46:22.908
Look at him. He looks silly,
doesn't he, upside down?

46:25.202 --> 46:27.412
Do it for freedom and the Nightrider!

46:27.496 --> 46:29.206
I can't. No!

46:30.457 --> 46:32.918
You scum-sucking trash!

46:33.001 --> 46:34.503
Throw it!

46:34.711 --> 46:37.464
I can't stand the pain!

47:10.038 --> 47:11.707
Max.

48:12.267 --> 48:16.814
That "thing" in there, that's not the Goose.
No way.

49:22.796 --> 49:24.631
I was hungry.

49:26.550 --> 49:28.468
Peanut butter and honey.

49:44.151 --> 49:46.862
I just can't get it clear in my head, Jess.

49:49.156 --> 49:52.784
He was so full of living, you know.
He ran the franchise on it.

49:54.411 --> 49:56.163
Now there's nothing.

49:58.957 --> 50:01.627
Here I am, trying to put sense to it...

50:02.461 --> 50:04.630
...when I know there isn't any.

50:08.759 --> 50:11.970
I'll be all right,
once I get it clear in my head.

50:41.792 --> 50:43.836
- What's this?
- I'm through.

50:44.336 --> 50:45.963
- Again?
- No, not again.

50:46.088 --> 50:48.507
- I'm through. I'm quitting.
- Sit down.

50:48.590 --> 50:52.511
No, I didn't come here to discuss it,
I came to say it. I'm through.

50:52.803 --> 50:54.555
Now, just a minute!

50:55.931 --> 50:57.808
All right, so the Goose bought it.

50:57.891 --> 50:59.768
That's the way
he always came at the world.

50:59.810 --> 51:01.061
Off beat.

51:01.311 --> 51:04.398
Max, you'd be the first to admit
it was long overdue.

51:05.482 --> 51:07.651
All right, I'll tell you how it is.

51:07.734 --> 51:09.486
You're a winner, Max.

51:09.570 --> 51:11.363
You're on the top shelf...

51:11.572 --> 51:15.742
...and I'm not gonna lose you because
of some crazy notion about quitting!

51:17.619 --> 51:21.165
They say people don't believe
in heroes anymore.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.584
Well, damn them!

51:23.625 --> 51:25.502
You and me, Max...

51:26.628 --> 51:29.256
...we're gonna give them back their heroes.

51:30.382 --> 51:33.302
Do you really expect me
to go for that crap?

51:33.594 --> 51:36.763
You gotta admit,
I sounded good there for a minute?

51:37.139 --> 51:38.265
'Bye, Fifi.

51:39.349 --> 51:41.643
Come on, do you want me to beg?

51:42.352 --> 51:44.938
Do you want me on my knees, crying?

51:45.355 --> 51:47.149
Now just a minute.

51:47.524 --> 51:49.151
Give me a reason.

51:52.988 --> 51:54.573
I'm scared, Fif.

51:55.657 --> 51:58.702
Do you know why?
It's that rat circus out there.

51:59.036 --> 52:00.496
I'm beginning to enjoy it.

52:00.537 --> 52:02.039
What is this, funny week?

52:02.164 --> 52:05.083
Any longer out on that road,
and I'm one of them, you know?

52:05.292 --> 52:06.919
A terminal crazy.

52:07.503 --> 52:10.672
Only, I've got a bronze badge
to say I'm one of the good guys.

52:10.756 --> 52:13.091
You know what I'm trying to say?

52:13.967 --> 52:16.053
I'll tell you what I'll do.

52:20.641 --> 52:22.392
Take off a few weeks?

52:23.477 --> 52:25.354
Grow yourself a beard.

52:25.813 --> 52:28.482
Draw flies. Just think about it for a while.

52:29.024 --> 52:32.402
If you still feel the same way
when you come back, it's okay by me.

52:32.486 --> 52:33.654
Go on.

52:39.284 --> 52:41.203
I'm not gonna change my mind.

52:41.245 --> 52:44.414
Get out of here
before I decide to come with you.

52:45.290 --> 52:47.793
'Bye, Fif. Thank you.

52:51.630 --> 52:53.757
You'll be back, Rockatansky!

52:54.716 --> 52:56.343
You're hooked, Max.

52:57.219 --> 52:58.804
And you know it!

54:04.119 --> 54:08.624
I've never been able to say things to you,
Jess, about how I feel.

54:11.126 --> 54:13.670
Guess I always
counted on you understanding.

54:21.470 --> 54:23.222
When I was a kid...

54:23.764 --> 54:28.143
...me and my father
used to go for long walks.

54:30.479 --> 54:32.815
I remember staring down at his shoes.

54:34.316 --> 54:37.444
They were special shoes, brown.

54:38.362 --> 54:40.864
And he always kept them really shiny.

54:43.450 --> 54:47.871
He was tall,
and he used to take long strides.

54:49.164 --> 54:51.792
And there I'd be right alongside him...

54:52.125 --> 54:54.294
...just trying to keep up with him.

54:58.257 --> 55:02.344
I don't think he ever knew
how proud I felt of him.

55:04.847 --> 55:07.808
Or how good it felt
just to be there alongside him.

55:10.853 --> 55:13.897
Even now, when I think back on it,
I still feel"..."

55:18.318 --> 55:20.362
The thing is, Jess...

55:21.864 --> 55:25.826
...I couldn't tell him about it then,
but I can tell you about it now.

55:29.580 --> 55:33.834
I don't wanna wait 10 years to tell you
how I'm feeling about you right now.

56:01.445 --> 56:02.613
Get a load of that!

56:02.696 --> 56:04.323
We had a blowout a while back.

56:04.406 --> 56:06.241
Raunchy, very raunchy.

56:06.658 --> 56:07.951
What's the donk like?

56:08.035 --> 56:10.454
Yeah, the donk's fine.
Look, about this tire"..."

56:10.746 --> 56:14.249
Don't do much work on these myself,
except to scrape 'em off the road.

56:14.500 --> 56:16.919
Yeah. Hey, how about this tire?

56:16.960 --> 56:18.378
Have it fixed in no time.

56:18.420 --> 56:21.048
I can sell you a set of 'lops
for next to nothing.

56:21.089 --> 56:24.384
I can't remember where I got 'em,
but I got 'em, know what I mean?

56:24.760 --> 56:28.180
No, we'll be all right
just as soon as we get this fixed.

56:28.263 --> 56:29.765
- Max?
- Yeah?

56:31.099 --> 56:32.100
Listen...

56:33.101 --> 56:36.438
...Sproggo's talked me
into buying him an ice cream, so...

56:36.605 --> 56:38.232
...I think I'll see you later.

56:38.607 --> 56:41.401
Sure, there's a shop just down the beach.

56:41.693 --> 56:43.612
They'll appreciate the business.

56:43.737 --> 56:45.364
Sure, thanks.

56:45.948 --> 56:47.074
Toodlepip.

57:01.505 --> 57:04.758
You just trucking around?
Good time for just trucking.

57:04.925 --> 57:08.178
Wish I could do a bit myself.
Which way you heading? North?

57:08.262 --> 57:09.096
Maybe.

57:39.543 --> 57:42.045
Look what's turned up for Sunday dinner.

57:43.046 --> 57:45.716
Main course and dessert.

57:46.550 --> 57:48.177
My favorite kind:

57:49.178 --> 57:50.345
Female.

58:29.968 --> 58:31.929
Watch the tongue, lovable.

58:31.970 --> 58:34.556
I've seen him lick his own eyebrow clean.

59:07.214 --> 59:08.924
Must've spent some coin.

59:08.966 --> 59:12.344
Like the sign says,
speed's just a question of money.

59:12.469 --> 59:14.429
How fast do you wanna go?

59:14.680 --> 59:16.640
- Max, quick, get in.
- What's wrong?

59:16.723 --> 59:18.559
Just take my word for it, get in!

59:18.684 --> 59:21.311
- What about the tire?
- Please, Max!

59:23.564 --> 59:24.940
Your tire, man.

59:25.941 --> 59:27.651
Hey, fella, what about your tire!

59:27.651 --> 59:28.694
Hey, fella, what about your tire!

59:32.197 --> 59:33.782
Crazy people!

59:35.242 --> 59:37.452
The world's full of crazy people.

59:54.553 --> 59:56.221
That wagon, was it here?

59:56.346 --> 59:57.890
A couple with a kid.

59:57.973 --> 59:59.558
I was just fixing their tire.

59:59.641 --> 01:00:02.936
They left their goddamn spare.
Not a bad one either.

01:00:04.354 --> 01:00:07.816
- Who are they?
- A couple, passing through.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.860
Said they were heading north. Maybe.

01:00:22.998 --> 01:00:24.833
You want to drive the car? Yeah?

01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:28.045
Well, we wouldn't have a car anymore.
Into the back.

01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:29.588
Here you go.

01:00:31.423 --> 01:00:35.344
I can still see his face now.
Looked as if he'd just swallowed a brick.

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:38.388
What a mean old lady you are. Huh, boss?

01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:41.225
That's enough from you, mate! Enough.

01:00:46.522 --> 01:00:48.482
What's the matter with you?

01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:53.946
What you got there, mate?

01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:06.875
Yeah, that's the way I see it, too.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:13.090
Sure. It's been nice talking to you". '"Bye.

01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:16.468
Take it you agreed with him.

01:01:16.552 --> 01:01:18.470
They're not worried, I'm not worried.

01:01:18.554 --> 01:01:20.097
What about that?

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:23.016
I figure it's lost property.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.520
If no one makes a claim to it,
I say we can forget it.

01:01:28.397 --> 01:01:30.357
Sounds okay to me, Jess.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.733
Don't know.

01:01:31.817 --> 01:01:34.736
If Ziggy says so, believe me, it's okay.

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:38.073
May's expecting you
up at the farm sometime.

01:01:38.365 --> 01:01:41.785
You'll have no more trouble up there.
Just green grass.

01:02:15.402 --> 01:02:17.070
How are you doing?

01:02:17.696 --> 01:02:19.198
I'm getting there.

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:30.000
I reckon you ought to connect
the doohickey to the gizmo.

01:02:32.794 --> 01:02:34.129
Come here, you.

01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:38.091
You touch me with those hands
and I'll rip you apart. No!

01:02:38.509 --> 01:02:40.093
Look at them! No!

01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:03.659
May told me about the little beach
down by the trees. Do you want to come?

01:03:04.159 --> 01:03:05.327
Love to.

01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:09.832
Except that I've gotta fix the fan belt,
or we're never gonna get outta here.

01:03:09.915 --> 01:03:13.001
Okay, Tarzan,
I'll bring you back some bananas.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.875
If you meet Benno down there,
don't let him bother you.

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:54.585
He's only a baby.

01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:57.129
Sure, May.

01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:46.233
- The men.
- What men?

01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:49.278
Now you calm down
and you tell me what's the matter.

01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:51.113
Very, very naughty.

01:07:51.446 --> 01:07:54.241
- Now, you tell May what you...
- May.

01:07:54.908 --> 01:07:57.411
May, you call The Dark One.

01:07:57.703 --> 01:08:00.831
And you tell him
to get here as fast as he can.

01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:02.374
Why? What's going on?

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:05.752
I think we've got some hoon trouble.
It's gonna be all right.

01:08:06.211 --> 01:08:10.632
Come on, darling. Come on, Jessie.
Well, let's go into the house.

01:08:23.937 --> 01:08:27.107
You've had an awful time, darling.

01:08:28.066 --> 01:08:30.694
But it's all over now.

01:08:31.028 --> 01:08:33.988
Everything's going to be all right.

01:08:38.952 --> 01:08:41.787
I've just got to go and make a phone call...

01:08:41.955 --> 01:08:44.917
...and then we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.

01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:06.563
The Dark One, and hurry it up, will you?

01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:08.732
It's May Swaisey.

01:09:16.907 --> 01:09:19.326
Sprog? Oh, no!

01:09:29.294 --> 01:09:30.546
Sprog?

01:09:33.881 --> 01:09:35.050
Sprog!

01:09:39.595 --> 01:09:40.680
Sprog!

01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:05.706
Well, well, well.

01:10:06.957 --> 01:10:09.042
It's our little mother.

01:10:12.963 --> 01:10:15.507
That there is Cundalini...

01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:19.219
...and Cundalini wants his hand back.

01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:22.514
I want my baby.

01:10:22.598 --> 01:10:24.183
Tell you what...

01:10:25.893 --> 01:10:27.519
...l'll swap you.

01:10:28.479 --> 01:10:30.647
Please, give me my baby.

01:10:30.731 --> 01:10:31.732
Jessie.

01:10:35.652 --> 01:10:38.155
You've not got a sense of humor.

01:10:39.698 --> 01:10:43.076
You've got a pretty face, though.
Awful pretty.

01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:45.704
Awful pretty.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.498
I suppose...

01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:50.584
...you don't need a sense of humor
with a pretty face.

01:10:51.376 --> 01:10:53.879
The only trouble is though, missy...

01:10:53.962 --> 01:10:55.464
...if you should...

01:10:57.216 --> 01:10:58.592
...lose the face...

01:10:58.967 --> 01:11:00.552
Please, don't hurt my baby.

01:11:00.594 --> 01:11:02.179
...you've got nothing!

01:11:02.262 --> 01:11:04.056
What do you want from me?

01:11:04.681 --> 01:11:07.309
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!

01:11:07.309 --> 01:11:07.976
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!

01:11:09.102 --> 01:11:10.229
Right there!

01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:14.691
- I hate guns.
- Old lady.

01:11:14.775 --> 01:11:15.901
Stand back!

01:11:15.984 --> 01:11:18.403
- Stay back!
- Woman!

01:11:18.487 --> 01:11:19.738
Stay back!

01:11:27.913 --> 01:11:32.334
Anyone so much as breathes,
I'll cheese him!

01:11:32.543 --> 01:11:34.086
Open that door.

01:11:34.127 --> 01:11:36.046
Everyone of you, in there.

01:11:38.632 --> 01:11:40.717
Put the babe on the ground.

01:11:43.929 --> 01:11:45.764
Jessie, get the van.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.390
Don't stop. Just go right through.

01:12:52.289 --> 01:12:53.332
Now what?

01:13:01.256 --> 01:13:03.342
- The motor!
- What are you trying to say?

01:13:03.425 --> 01:13:05.302
I don't know, it just died on me.

01:13:55.435 --> 01:13:56.562
Jessie!

01:13:57.312 --> 01:13:58.480
Where?

01:14:00.107 --> 01:14:02.192
Lord, have mercy!

01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:49.573
What do you reckon?

01:14:49.823 --> 01:14:51.825
I'm a doctor, not a fortuneteller.

01:14:52.326 --> 01:14:53.660
This your subdural?

01:14:53.744 --> 01:14:56.038
- Yes, that's her.
- Lot of problems?

01:14:56.121 --> 01:14:59.791
Multiple traumas, spleen,
liver, lung, flail chest...

01:15:00.042 --> 01:15:02.628
...left neck of femur, renal shutdown.

01:15:02.794 --> 01:15:05.130
Reads like a grocery list. She salvageable?

01:15:05.214 --> 01:15:08.133
Yeah, sure,
we got all her signs back last night.

01:15:08.258 --> 01:15:09.968
- Relatives?
- The husband.

01:15:10.177 --> 01:15:12.095
They lost the kid. DOA.

01:15:12.721 --> 01:15:16.558
Listen, tell him she's going to be all right.
Tell him not to worry.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:18.852
Tell him, if he wants, I'll talk to him.

01:15:19.603 --> 01:15:22.189
I don't think he wants to talk to anyone.

01:15:23.065 --> 01:15:25.400
He's been standing there
like a zombie all day.

01:16:28.338 --> 01:16:30.424
Bubba Zanetti, is that you?

01:16:31.466 --> 01:16:33.427
You come for the grunt?

01:16:33.969 --> 01:16:36.388
She won't be ready until this afternoon.

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:38.932
Still having trouble with the front forks.

01:16:38.974 --> 01:16:41.185
They're mongrels to work with.

01:16:43.896 --> 01:16:45.022
You asshole!

01:16:45.105 --> 01:16:47.065
What the molly fuck
you think you're doing?

01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:50.611
You and me are gonna talk
about the Toecutter.

01:16:51.278 --> 01:16:52.779
Never heard of him.

01:16:53.906 --> 01:16:55.574
What the Christ are you?

01:16:55.657 --> 01:16:57.743
I wanna know about the tattoo.

01:16:57.868 --> 01:16:59.745
I mind my own business, don't I?

01:16:59.786 --> 01:17:02.289
I mean, they'll kill me, won't they?

01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:20.140
I'll say the names,
and you say "yes" or "no"."

01:17:21.475 --> 01:17:23.101
Nightrider...

01:17:24.019 --> 01:17:27.481
...Toecutter, Bubba Zanetti.
- Yes.

01:17:27.523 --> 01:17:28.982
There's more?

01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:31.151
- Johnny.
- Johnny the Boy?

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.946
- Yeah. Some others.
- Where?

01:17:34.863 --> 01:17:36.907
Out at the beaches, looking for fuel.

01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:38.700
Are they coming back?

01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:41.411
I don't know. They gotta get their bikes.

01:17:42.412 --> 01:17:43.580
For Christ's sake!

01:17:43.664 --> 01:17:45.374
I don't know.

01:22:02.256 --> 01:22:03.924
<i>Code Unspecified.</i>

01:22:04.424 --> 01:22:07.511
<i>We have a query
locate on a black Pursuit Special.</i>

01:22:07.886 --> 01:22:10.722
<i>Unauthorized use by a Main Force Officer.</i>

01:22:11.515 --> 01:22:16.103
<i>This is designated as a potential
Code 3 Red Alert.</i>

01:23:10.073 --> 01:23:11.783
Quit toying, Bubba.

01:23:12.367 --> 01:23:15.245
Easy. I know what I'm doing.

01:27:39.384 --> 01:27:40.344
Hi.

01:27:43.388 --> 01:27:45.724
This isn't what it looks, man.

01:27:45.933 --> 01:27:48.894
I just came down here
to check it out, and...

01:27:49.186 --> 01:27:51.855
...this guy, he's already snuffed it.

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:54.191
Nothing you could do for him.

01:27:55.818 --> 01:27:56.777
Ankle.

01:27:58.445 --> 01:27:59.696
It's okay.

01:28:04.243 --> 01:28:06.245
What are you doing, man?

01:28:16.547 --> 01:28:20.884
Hey, listen, I had nothing to do
with anything going on back there, man.

01:28:21.385 --> 01:28:25.139
Listen, man, will you? Listen to me!

01:28:25.222 --> 01:28:28.100
They were a hell of a lot of
crazy people back there, man.

01:28:28.809 --> 01:28:32.604
Some kind of bad people.
I'm not responsible for anything.

01:28:34.356 --> 01:28:37.442
What are you doing, man?

01:28:39.069 --> 01:28:42.114
What do you say? What are you doing?

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:47.202
Hey, listen. I'm not a bad man.

01:28:47.286 --> 01:28:49.329
I'm sick, see? Sick.

01:28:49.955 --> 01:28:51.623
What do you call it?

01:28:51.748 --> 01:28:54.668
Psychopathic, you know.
Personality disorder.

01:28:54.793 --> 01:28:56.879
The court, man, he said so.

01:28:56.962 --> 01:28:59.381
You're not gonna hurt me, are you?

01:29:03.051 --> 01:29:05.471
Jesus! You can't kill me!

01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:08.724
Not for stealing a man's boots!

01:29:10.058 --> 01:29:12.394
He was dead, for Christ's sake!

01:29:14.771 --> 01:29:16.773
He won't need 'em anymore.

01:29:18.192 --> 01:29:19.860
What are you doing?

01:29:21.862 --> 01:29:24.156
I wanna know what you're doing.

01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:33.457
The chain in those handcuffs
is high-tensile steel.

01:29:35.334 --> 01:29:38.795
It'd take you ten minutes
to hack through it with this.

01:29:40.798 --> 01:29:43.050
Now, if you're lucky...

01:29:43.217 --> 01:29:46.386
...you could hack through your ankle
in five minutes.

01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:47.471
Go.

01:29:49.181 --> 01:29:50.808
You're mad, man!

01:29:51.642 --> 01:29:54.102
You think I look silly, don't you?

01:29:55.479 --> 01:29:57.356
Don't bring this on me, man.

01:29:57.773 --> 01:29:59.525
Don't do this to me!

01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:03.821
Please, sweet Jesus. I was sick!

01:30:03.821 --> 01:30:04.321
Please, sweet Jesus. I was sick!

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.158
Don't bring this on me, please!
