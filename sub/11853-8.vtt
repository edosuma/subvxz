11:20.880 --> 11:24.784

Hello.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.231
Where's the ring?

11:39.298 --> 11:43.769
Uhh, we're, uhh, at this time,
uhh, presently, uhh,

11:43.836 --> 11:47.306
working on the situation, uhh,
sir.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.509
You don't know
where the ring is?

11:50.576 --> 11:55.014
Ah, well, sir, uhh, you see,
there was a puppy.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.148
And two kids.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.817
{\an1}Shh.

11:57.883 --> 12:01.520
I'm sorry. Did someone
say "Kids"? Children?

12:01.587 --> 12:05.257
Two children, sir, and a puppy.

12:05.324 --> 12:07.126
Well, where are they?

12:07.193 --> 12:10.096
Umm, I'm not entirely sure but--

12:10.162 --> 12:11.464
<i>Ah!</i>

12:11.530 --> 12:16.168
The ring, Raoul,
someone's taken the ring!

12:16.235 --> 12:18.037
{\an3}Wake up!

12:18.104 --> 12:22.975
There: two children and a puppy.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.343
(Phone ringing)

12:24.410 --> 12:26.779
<i>Uhh, sir, I--</i>
<i>I think we got cut off.</i>

12:26.846 --> 12:29.281
<i>They're getting away!</i>
<i>They've got the ring!</i>

12:29.348 --> 12:30.316
<i>And they're getting away!</i>

12:30.382 --> 12:32.017
After them!

12:32.084 --> 12:34.120
<i>After them!</i>

12:34.186 --> 12:35.121
Not that way.

12:35.187 --> 12:36.589
They're in the forest

12:36.655 --> 12:39.024
and heading toward the realm
of the Flutter Guppies.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.192
Hurry!

12:40.259 --> 12:42.361
<i>Yes, Your High-nosity!</i>

12:46.031 --> 12:49.668
I don't know why I bother
sometimes, Raoul, you know?

12:49.735 --> 12:54.206
(Snoring)

12:54.273 --> 13:00.079
Oh, never mind.

13:00.146 --> 13:04.917
The forest looks different
in here.

13:04.984 --> 13:08.888
I think we're lost.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.656
(Barking)

13:10.723 --> 13:13.092
I've never been off
the road before.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.461
Now I don't know where we are.

13:15.528 --> 13:19.832
Well, at least we got away
from those soldiers.

13:19.899 --> 13:21.433

13:32.211 --> 13:33.979
What is it, boy?

13:34.046 --> 13:37.850
Careful, Gilly. There could be
wild animals in this forest.

13:37.917 --> 13:43.055
It's okay, boy.
There's nothing here. See?

13:43.122 --> 13:45.591
Ah!

13:59.505 --> 14:02.975
{\an3}Ah!

14:03.042 --> 14:07.413
Now what do we do?

14:07.479 --> 14:12.618
All right, everyone, let's just
take it easy. Calm down.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.054

"Realm"? Why, that means--

What does it mean?

15:59.224 --> 16:04.063
A realm is an area or place.

16:22.781 --> 16:23.782
We don't know.

16:23.849 --> 16:25.651
But we can't get it off.

16:36.528 --> 16:37.629
{\an3}"Never"?

16:37.696 --> 16:39.832
{\an3}Never.

16:39.898 --> 16:42.701
We must go with them.

16:42.768 --> 16:43.702
{\an4}You will?

16:42.768 --> 16:43.702
You will?

16:43.769 --> 16:44.837
{\an3}Yes.

16:44.903 --> 16:47.906

Mmm, no, no,
that won't work either.

35:59.724 --> 36:03.961
How about a cookie? Nah.

36:05.696 --> 36:10.835
A toothbrush! A banana!
Macaroni and cheese? Gah!

36:10.902 --> 36:13.371
(Creaking)

36:13.437 --> 36:18.376
{\an3}Hello?

36:18.442 --> 36:19.710
Do you think he saw us?

36:19.777 --> 36:22.680
I don't think so.

36:22.747 --> 36:24.482
He's got Bubble Puppy in a cage.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.750
{\an3}I know.

36:25.816 --> 36:28.886
And the Sun King is asleep.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.656
(Snoring)

36:31.722 --> 36:35.626
What are we going to do, Gilly?

36:35.693 --> 36:36.627
{\an3}Gilly?

36:36.694 --> 36:39.564
{\an1}I know.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.233
{\an5}The Hoodie of Invisibility!

36:39.630 --> 36:42.233
The Hoodie of Invisibility!

36:42.300 --> 36:44.835
I'll turn invisible
and rescue Bubble Puppy.

36:44.902 --> 36:47.338
And I'll wake up the Sun King.

36:47.405 --> 36:49.740
{\an1}Okay.

36:49.807 --> 36:54.612
How about a squeaky bone?

36:54.679 --> 36:56.447
(Panting)

36:56.514 --> 36:57.648
Oh, for crying in my soup,

36:57.715 --> 36:59.750
is there nothing in here
I can use?

36:59.817 --> 37:03.287
GILLY:
Hey, boy. It's me. I'm here.

37:03.354 --> 37:08.225
(Whimpering)

37:08.292 --> 37:09.226
(Barking)

37:09.293 --> 37:10.528
{\an3}Oh.

37:10.595 --> 37:15.232
Has the little doggie-woggie
got something to say?

37:17.034 --> 37:17.969
Raoul, what do you think?

37:18.035 --> 37:19.437
Maybe we'll just

37:19.503 --> 37:23.941
tickle the little doggie
until he gives us the ring.

37:24.008 --> 37:26.544
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

37:26.611 --> 37:29.680
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

37:29.747 --> 37:32.450
(Babbling)

37:32.516 --> 37:34.685
Huh?

37:34.752 --> 37:35.686
{\an1}Huh?

37:35.753 --> 37:37.221
Go, Bubble Puppy!

37:37.288 --> 37:42.426
Raoul, help! There's something
very wrong with my hat!

37:42.493 --> 37:44.962
You!

37:45.997 --> 37:48.199
What are you doing?

37:48.265 --> 37:49.433
Molly, look out!

37:49.500 --> 37:54.205
I do not know who you are
or where you come from.

37:54.271 --> 37:57.208
But if you think you can
wake up the Sun King

37:57.274 --> 38:00.344
without the ring--
which, by the way, is mine now--

38:00.411 --> 38:04.515
then you're very wrong.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.887
And besides, you're too late,
anyway.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.690
The Sun is going down.

38:12.757 --> 38:17.428
Sun King, better wake up.

38:17.495 --> 38:18.796
(Snoring)

38:18.863 --> 38:23.801
The Sun is about to
go down forever.

38:23.868 --> 38:25.803
(Snoring)

38:25.870 --> 38:27.338
No? Nothing?

38:27.405 --> 38:28.572
{\an3}Well,

38:28.639 --> 38:30.274
{\an1}everyone,

38:30.341 --> 38:33.811
it looks as if it's going to be
night-night forever and ever.

38:33.878 --> 38:37.515
Now give me the dog.

38:37.581 --> 38:39.483
(Whimpering)

38:39.550 --> 38:41.152
You leave our friends alone!

38:41.218 --> 38:42.687
What?

38:42.753 --> 38:45.489
Let them go, Night Wizard!

38:45.556 --> 38:48.359
And their little dog too!

38:48.426 --> 38:49.927
{\an3}Hello.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.064
"Let them go"? Ah, that's rich.

38:53.130 --> 38:56.567
It's far too late to save

38:56.634 --> 38:59.870
the day now, Guppies.

38:59.937 --> 39:01.872
Seize them. Seize them all.

39:01.939 --> 39:03.741
Lobsters seizing,

39:03.808 --> 39:05.609
lobsters seizing.

39:05.676 --> 39:08.245
{\an5}Ah!

39:05.676 --> 39:08.245
{\an1}Ah!

39:08.312 --> 39:10.581
Lobsters seizing!

39:10.648 --> 39:11.582
(Growling)

39:11.649 --> 39:12.616
{\an1}Eek!

39:12.683 --> 39:14.051
(Laughing)

39:14.118 --> 39:18.889
Lobsters seizing, lobsters-- Ah!

39:18.956 --> 39:20.624
{\an4}Ah!

39:18.956 --> 39:20.624
{\an3}Ah!

39:20.691 --> 39:24.795
{\an6}Ah!

39:20.691 --> 39:24.795
{\an1}Ah!

39:24.862 --> 39:26.297
(Growling)

39:26.363 --> 39:27.732
Ah!

39:27.798 --> 39:29.500
(Laughing)

39:29.567 --> 39:34.538
Now's our chance. We have to get
Bubble Puppy to the Sun King.

39:36.340 --> 39:37.675
(Hissing)

39:37.742 --> 39:41.245
{\an4}Ah!

39:37.742 --> 39:41.245
{\an3}Ah!

39:41.312 --> 39:44.248
Here you go. Get the lemon.
Go get it.

39:44.315 --> 39:47.485
(Panting)

39:47.551 --> 39:51.355
{\an3}Come on!

39:51.422 --> 39:54.992
{\an4}Ah!

39:51.422 --> 39:54.992
{\an3}Ah!

39:55.059 --> 39:58.629
Your Majesty, please wake up.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.965
I can't wake him up, Gilly.

40:01.031 --> 40:06.170
Sorry, children.
Time for night-night.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.239
(Growling)

40:08.305 --> 40:10.341
Ah!

40:10.407 --> 40:12.243
{\an4}Ah!

40:10.407 --> 40:12.243
{\an3}Ah!

40:12.309 --> 40:13.310
{\an6}Ah!

40:12.309 --> 40:13.310
{\an1}Ah!

40:13.377 --> 40:16.380
(Gasping)

40:16.447 --> 40:18.315
Molly, look.

40:18.382 --> 40:21.752
We have to point
the ring at the sun.

40:21.819 --> 40:25.289

Are you kidding?
Daytime is awesome.

42:18.569 --> 42:19.770
You can go sledding.

42:19.837 --> 42:21.906
And the flowers can bloom.

42:21.972 --> 42:23.507
And the animals can play.
