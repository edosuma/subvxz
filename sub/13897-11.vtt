WEBVTT

00:05.250 --> 00:06.170
&lt;SEAGULLS SQUAWKING&gt;

00:06.210 --> 00:08.380
HEY, DES,
TRY AND RELAX, OKAY?

00:08.420 --> 00:09.670
YEAH. OKAY.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.720
I JUST GOT A CASE
OF THE JITTERS, YOU KNOW?

00:14.760 --> 00:16.680
PLUS I SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD
THOSE FIVE WHITE HEATS
FROM HAVA JAVA.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.060
MELTED CHOCOLATE'S
REALLY NOT MY FRIEND.

00:20.140 --> 00:23.230
HE LOOKS LIKE YOU.
WELL, OBVIOUSLY.

00:23.270 --> 00:24.730
WELL, THAT'S WEIRD,
BECAUSE THAT'S...

00:24.770 --> 00:25.900
THAT'S NOT MY DAD.

00:25.940 --> 00:26.980
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:27.020 --> 00:28.190
I MET WITH HIM
MYSELF IN PRISON.

00:28.230 --> 00:29.280
HE HAD A PHOTO OF YOU.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.690
YEAH. NO, NO, NO. NO,
THAT'S RALPH.

00:30.740 --> 00:31.820
THAT'S MY DAD'S CELLMATE.

00:31.860 --> 00:33.030
HE ALWAYS PRETENDS
TO BE MY DAD.

00:33.070 --> 00:34.110
HE PROBABLY STOLE
THAT PHOTOGRAPH.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.570
PRISON CAN DO
WEIRD THINGS TO A MAN.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.240
IN ANY CASE,
EITHER WAY, DES, UM,

00:39.290 --> 00:41.250
IT'S PERFECTLY OKAY FOR
YOU TO FEEL WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO FEEL.

00:41.290 --> 00:42.500
I MEAN, YOUR DAD
JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL.

00:42.540 --> 00:43.830
IT'S GONNA STIR UP
SOME BIG EMOTIONS.

00:43.870 --> 00:44.960
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S JUST THAT, NORMALLY,

00:45.000 --> 00:46.170
WHEN I SEE HIM
HE'S ON THE INSIDE

00:46.210 --> 00:47.340
WHERE HE WAS
A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE,

00:47.380 --> 00:48.340
AND NOW THAT
HE'S BEING RELEASED,

00:48.380 --> 00:49.840
WE'RE GOING TO SEE
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.170
THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE?

00:51.210 --> 00:52.340
WHAT IF HE
DOESN'T LIKE ME?

00:52.380 --> 00:53.510
OH...

00:53.550 --> 00:54.930
JAKE ALWAYS SAYS
I HAVE A WAY

00:54.970 --> 00:56.300
OF WEARING ON PEOPLE'S NERVES,
WHICH IS TOTALLY TRUE

00:56.340 --> 00:57.800
BECAUSE SOMETIMES I EVEN
BUG MYSELF TO THE POINT

00:57.850 --> 00:59.350
WHERE I JUST TUNE OUT.

00:59.390 --> 01:00.970
OKAY, YOUR DAD IS
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING YOU.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.850
IT'S OKAY.

01:02.890 --> 01:04.350
WHAT IF HE'S
DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY
I TURNED OUT?

01:04.390 --> 01:06.190
OH, MY GOD,
HE JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.110
I'M SURE HE'S NOT
GOING TO JUDGE.

01:08.150 --> 01:12.070
BESIDES, ANYONE WOULD
BE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU
IN THEIR FAMILY.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.860
-OH, HE'S COMING.
HE'S COMING.
-OKAY. GOOD LUCK.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.870
IT'S GOOD TO
SEE YOU, SON.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.330
PIERCE.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.300
UH, ACTUALLY,
I... I GO BY "DES" NOW.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.840
DES. RIGHT. SORRY.

01:31.880 --> 01:32.880
HI, DES.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.630
HI.

01:36.380 --> 01:38.140
UH, OH, THIS IS ROSE.

01:39.510 --> 01:40.930
OH, HI!

01:40.970 --> 01:42.430
HI.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.230
THANKS. UH, THANKS FOR...

01:45.270 --> 01:48.020
FOR MEETING UP WITH ME.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

01:48.060 --> 01:49.310
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

01:49.360 --> 01:52.150
YOU LOOK JUST GREAT.
YOU LOOK JUST GREAT.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.820
AND SO DO YOU.
YOU LOOK GREAT TOO.

01:54.860 --> 01:56.700
THANK YOU. THANKS.

01:56.740 --> 01:58.200
I... I MEAN, YOU LOOK
NICE IS ALL I'M...

01:58.240 --> 02:00.740
-NO... THANK...
-UH, SORRY.

02:00.780 --> 02:03.290
OH, GOD. IT'S GONNA TAKE
ME A WHILE TO GET USED TO...

02:03.330 --> 02:05.460
TO, YOU KNOW, BEING OUT.
TO EVERYTHING.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.250
SO WHAT DO I CALL YOU?

02:08.290 --> 02:12.750
SHOULD... UH, JODY,
OR MR. REDMOND?

02:12.800 --> 02:15.670
OR, OR MAYBE A NICKNAME
IF YOU HAD ONE ON THE INSIDE?

02:15.720 --> 02:17.130
UH, YOU COULD TRY...

02:17.180 --> 02:19.220
TRY "DAD" IF YOU... YOU KNOW,

02:19.260 --> 02:21.260
IF... IF...
IF IT'S NOT TOO SOON.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.270
UH, NO.
YEAH, "DAD" COULD WORK.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.930
RIGHT NOW THERE'S
SOMETHING URGENT

02:25.980 --> 02:27.270
THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.390
YEAH, OKAY.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.600
AH!

02:29.650 --> 02:30.860
GEEZ!

02:30.900 --> 02:32.900
[MAN] LET'S GO, JODY,
IF YOU WANT YOUR BOY TO LIVE.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.030
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TO HIM?

02:34.070 --> 02:35.190
[MAN] HE'S NOT WORTH IT.

02:35.230 --> 02:36.320
HE'S RIGHT. I'M NOT.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.070
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

02:43.370 --> 02:45.040
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

02:48.670 --> 02:50.080
&lt;PANTING&gt;

02:52.250 --> 02:54.210
ARE YOU OKAY, DES?

02:54.250 --> 02:56.090
NO, ROSE.
SOMEONE KIDNAPPED MY DAD.

03:01.840 --> 03:02.930
♪ OH, YEAH

03:02.970 --> 03:03.970
♪ OH, YEAH

03:04.850 --> 03:05.930

03:23.280 --> 03:25.450
DES, POPPY AND
UNCLE JAKE ARE ON THIS.

03:25.490 --> 03:27.120
I GOTTA GO.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.540
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA. WHOA, WHOA.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING? COME ON.

03:28.580 --> 03:31.250
YOU CAN'T RUN OFF
HALF-COCKED HERE, OKAY?

03:31.290 --> 03:32.580
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HELP YOUR DAD.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.540
JAKE, THEY HAVE
MY FATHER.

03:34.590 --> 03:35.920
YOU'D DO THE
SAME THING IF THEY
HAD MALACHY.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.460
WELL, NOT NECESSARILY.

03:37.510 --> 03:39.090
UNCLE JAKE, HE'S RIGHT.

03:39.130 --> 03:40.380
WE HAVE TO FIND HIS DAD.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.390
WHAT ARE THE COPS SAYING?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.260
NOTHING'S BEEN REPORTED
TO THE POLICE AS OF YET.

03:44.300 --> 03:45.390
PRETTY CLEAN GETAWAY.

03:45.430 --> 03:46.510
ALL RIGHT, DES,
YOU NEED TO TELL US

03:46.560 --> 03:47.720
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.270
DID JODY MENTION, DID
ANYBODY HAVE IT OUT FOR HIM?

03:50.310 --> 03:51.730
NO! I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

03:51.770 --> 03:52.850
HE PROBABLY MADE A FEW ENEMIES

03:52.900 --> 03:53.980
WHILE HE WAS IN THE SLAMMER.

03:54.020 --> 03:55.230
ONE WOULD BE BOUND TO,
BUT, LOOK,

03:55.270 --> 03:56.440
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO HERE!

03:56.480 --> 03:57.400
IT'S OKAY, DES.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.740
WE KNOW YOUR FATHER
WAS INVOLVED

03:58.780 --> 04:00.240
IN A STRING OF
JEWELRY STORE ROBBERIES.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.780
-LET'S START THERE.
-RIGHT.

04:01.820 --> 04:03.820
FIRST, HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW
THAT HE WAS GETTING OUT?

04:03.870 --> 04:04.950
BECAUSE I VISITED HIM

04:04.990 --> 04:06.280
A COUPLE TIMES
IN THE LAST YEAR.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.290
AND THEN HE CALLS ME,

04:07.330 --> 04:08.490
AND THEN HE SAYS HE'S
BEING RELEASED

04:08.540 --> 04:10.040
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR,
AND THEN...

04:11.500 --> 04:12.920
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO MEET UP.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.420
AND HE SAID WE HAVE
A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

04:14.460 --> 04:15.590
WE MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER

04:15.630 --> 04:17.300
THAT JODY IS INVOLVED IN
SOMETHING CRIMINAL HERE.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.050
NO! NO, B'YS, HE'S CHANGED.

04:19.090 --> 04:21.220
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU...

04:21.260 --> 04:22.340
YOU GOTTA TRUST
ME ON THIS ONE,

04:22.380 --> 04:24.140
OKAY? I CAN FEEL IT.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.350
DES, WE DO TRUST YOU.
IT'S OKAY.

04:27.890 --> 04:29.600
UNCLE JAKE, WHAT NOW?

04:29.640 --> 04:31.560
WELL, NOW I COULD CALL LESLIE?

04:31.600 --> 04:33.310
NO! NO, NO, NO. NO, NO.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.310
IF WE RELY TOO MUCH
ON THE COPS, THEN...

04:35.350 --> 04:37.360
THEN THEY'RE GOING TO
SUSPECT THE WORST.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.440
AND IF HE'S CAUGHT
VIOLATING HIS PAROLE,

04:38.480 --> 04:39.530
EVEN BY ACCIDENT,

04:39.570 --> 04:40.650
THEN THEY'RE GONNA
SEND HIM BACK.

04:40.690 --> 04:42.070
OKAY, NO ONE'S GONNA
SEND HIM ANYWHERE,

04:42.110 --> 04:43.240
NOT YET.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.240
JUST LET US LOOK INTO THIS.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.450
ROSE, DID YOU GET
A GOOD LOOK

04:46.490 --> 04:47.740
AT THE GUY WHO GRABBED JODY?

04:47.780 --> 04:48.950
NO. I COULDN'T SEE HIS FACE.

04:48.990 --> 04:50.120
HE HAD A MASK ON.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.210
BUT I GOT THIS. PLATE NUMBER.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.460
IMAGE NEEDED WORK,
BUT I GOT IT.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.330
NICE. ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU
FOLLOW UP WITH THIS?

04:56.380 --> 04:57.750
DAD, LET'S GO CHECK OUT
THE PENITENTIARY.

04:57.790 --> 04:59.880
MAYBE JODY LEFT
SOME BELONGINGS THERE,

04:59.920 --> 05:01.010
SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANYTHING

05:01.050 --> 05:02.050
THAT MIGHT HELP US.

05:03.010 --> 05:05.220
DES, DON'T WORRY, ALL RIGHT?

05:05.260 --> 05:06.260
WE'RE ON THIS.

05:08.550 --> 05:10.560
YOU KNOW WHAT, WALTER?
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

05:10.600 --> 05:12.430
I JUST HAVE A LOT
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.060
[WALTER] YOU'RE NOT
RETURNING MY CALLS.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.350
LIKE, WHAT DID I DO?

05:15.390 --> 05:16.850
THAT'S...
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.900
BECAUSE IF IT'S ME,
I CAN CHANGE.

05:19.940 --> 05:22.070
LIKE, I CAN CHANGE BIG TIME.

05:22.110 --> 05:24.530
[KATHLEEN] LOOK, IT'S...
IT'S JUST ME, OKAY?

05:24.570 --> 05:25.820
AND... AND, YOU KNOW,

05:25.860 --> 05:27.370
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL,
SO...

05:30.950 --> 05:32.700
THIS WHOLE FAMILY. WOW.

05:32.750 --> 05:33.960
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

05:34.910 --> 05:36.460
IT'S REALLY CUTE, YOU KNOW?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.460
YOU ALL SEEM SO CLOSE.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.420
[WALTER] HELLO? KATHLEEN?

05:40.460 --> 05:41.460
WALTER, I GOTTA GO.

05:43.090 --> 05:44.380
HEY.

05:46.970 --> 05:49.890
GEORGE!
HEY, YOU LOOK GOOD.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.100
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN TOWN?

05:51.140 --> 05:53.350
THIS IS... THIS IS A...
A SURPRISE.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.480
AND NOW THIS

05:56.520 --> 05:57.850
HAS TO BE
YOUR DAUGHTER, RIGHT?

06:00.820 --> 06:02.400
YEAH, SHE LOOKS
JUST LIKE HER MOM.

06:04.150 --> 06:05.150
SO PRETTY.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.410
SO WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:09.410 --> 06:14.000
KATHLEEN, YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.500
YOU KNOW,
WE'D ALREADY BROKEN UP,

06:15.540 --> 06:16.910
RIGHT, WHEN I LEFT?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.290
SO...

06:19.920 --> 06:22.630
I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE I,
YOU KNOW,

06:22.670 --> 06:25.470
NEEDED TO ASK
YOUR PERMISSION
OR ANYTHING.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.510
I THINK
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO ME.

06:29.510 --> 06:31.600
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.390
YOU SEE, I DON'T
MIND THAT YOU TOOK
MY MONEY...

06:33.430 --> 06:35.730
WELL, I DO MIND.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.060
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.440
&lt;LAUGHS&gt; WHAT?

06:38.480 --> 06:39.440
BUT I HAVE A LOT MORE.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.520
COME ON. YOU'RE INSANE!

06:41.560 --> 06:42.570
I DIDN'T STEAL YOUR MONEY.

06:43.650 --> 06:45.570
WHY DON'T YOU
STOP TALKING NOW,

06:46.690 --> 06:48.320
BEFORE THAT HOLE YOU'RE
DIGGING BECOMES

06:48.360 --> 06:49.530
DEEP ENOUGH
TO BURY YOU IN?

06:51.200 --> 06:53.410
THAT MONEY IS ONE THING,
WE CAN DEAL
WITH THAT LATER.

06:53.450 --> 06:54.990
RIGHT NOW...

06:55.040 --> 07:00.580
RIGHT NOW, WHAT I WANT
IS MY LITTLE BLUE BOOK.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.290
HEY, COME ON. YOU...

07:03.540 --> 07:05.550
YOU SEE THAT BOOK HAS
ALL THE NAMES,

07:05.590 --> 07:07.340
AND MORE
IMPORTANTLY THE MONEY,

07:07.380 --> 07:09.470
THAT EACH OF THOSE
NAMES OWES ME.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.220
NOW I KNOW YOU SWIPED IT
FROM MY CLUB,

07:11.260 --> 07:13.510
SO DON'T TRY
AND TALK YOUR WAY
OUT OF THIS, KATHLEEN.

07:14.890 --> 07:16.680
I UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE
WOULD TAKE MONEY.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.310
WHY WOULD...
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE
A BOOK?

07:19.350 --> 07:23.770
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE
GOING TO LEAVE ME ALONE
IF I GIVE IT BACK TO YOU?

07:26.820 --> 07:27.900
HOW ABOUT THIS?

07:29.570 --> 07:33.490
I PROMISE YOU IF YOU
DON'T GIVE IT TO ME,

07:33.530 --> 07:35.200
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU ALONE.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.620
IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH?

07:38.120 --> 07:39.330
IT'S NOT HERE.

07:42.330 --> 07:43.580
CLOCK'S TICKING.

07:49.630 --> 07:50.630
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

07:52.970 --> 07:54.010
&lt;DOOR CLOSES&gt;

08:06.690 --> 08:07.690
&lt;SEAGULLS SQUAWKING&gt;

08:10.820 --> 08:12.490
SO, JODY LEFT ALL THIS
STUFF BEHIND...

08:12.530 --> 08:13.660
DES!

08:13.700 --> 08:16.160
LOOK, I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU TOLD ME TO STAY,
BUT I CAN'T.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.490
JAKE, PLEASE.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.250
I MEAN,
HE'S HERE NOW, SO...

08:20.870 --> 08:22.710
THIS IS WHAT REMAINS
OF JODY'S BELONGINGS

08:22.750 --> 08:24.130
LEFT BEHIND IN HIS CELL.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.420
A WHOLE LIFE
ON THIS PLANET

08:25.460 --> 08:26.710
AND ALL MY DAD
HAS TO SHOW FOR

08:26.750 --> 08:28.670
IT CAN FIT INSIDE
A CARDBOARD BOX?

08:28.710 --> 08:30.260
BETTER DAYS AHEAD, SON.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.670
QUITE THE ECLECTIC COLLECTION.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.180
YEAH, LIKE FATHER
LIKE SON.

08:33.220 --> 08:35.510
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

08:35.550 --> 08:36.850
WE HAD ONE OF THESE
WHEN I WAS A KID.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.140
UM, YEAH, AN AUSTRALIAN
CATTLE DOG.

08:39.180 --> 08:40.470
MY DAD SAID THAT
HE FOUND HIM,

08:40.520 --> 08:41.680
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
HE WON HIM
IN A GAME OF POKER,

08:41.730 --> 08:42.640
SO I CALLED HIM CHIP.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.100
-&lt;MAL CHUCKLES&gt;
-LOOK AT THIS.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.190
JODY'S GOT THE PAGE
TURNED DOWN, AND HE'S
GOT SOMETHING WRITTEN HERE.

08:48.230 --> 08:49.690
"PUFFIN PARTS CENTRE".

08:49.730 --> 08:51.940
THAT'S, UM, UH,
THAT'S AN ELECTRONICS COMPANY.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.610
I BOUGHT SOME STUFF
OFF THEM LAST YEAR,

08:53.650 --> 08:54.990
SURVEILLANCE GEAR.

08:55.030 --> 08:56.410
YOU BOUGHT...

08:56.450 --> 08:57.620
WHO PAID FOR IT?

08:57.660 --> 09:00.080
YOU. UH, ME. YOU. YOU DID.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.080
IT WAS DEADLY WICKED GEAR.
EXPENSIVE.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.710
-NICE WORK, DES.
-YEAH.

09:04.620 --> 09:06.170
MALACHY, A MINUTE?

09:06.210 --> 09:07.960
GO AWAY. WE ALL HATE YOU.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.090
ME?

09:09.130 --> 09:10.710
HE'S RIGHT.
THEY REALLY DO.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.840
WHATEVER.
DES, COME WITH ME.

09:12.880 --> 09:13.970
-WHAT?
-COME ON.

09:14.010 --> 09:15.130
OW!

09:17.300 --> 09:18.680
WHAT IS IT?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.930
BETWEEN US,
THIS JUST CAME IN.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.560
THOUGHT I SHOULD GIVE
YOU THE HEADS UP.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.070
APPRECIATE IT.

09:33.530 --> 09:35.150
I DON'T SEE
A BLACK SUV ANYWHERE.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.450
NOPE. I CAN'T BELIEVE
DES NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS,

09:38.490 --> 09:39.620
HIS DAD
GETTING OUT OF JAIL.

09:39.660 --> 09:41.910
I'M SURE HE WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU IN GOOD TIME.

09:41.950 --> 09:43.790
I GUESS HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK ANY LESS OF HIM.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.370
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.460
YEAH, RIGHT.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.710
KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF THAT, DOLLY.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.420
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

09:49.460 --> 09:51.090
LOOK, WE ALL LOVE DES,
AND I KNOW YOU CARE
ABOUT HIM THE MOST,

09:51.130 --> 09:52.630
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST
HELP HIM FIX THIS, OKAY?

09:53.630 --> 09:55.170
DEAL.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.260
OKAY, SO NO SUV.
NOW WHAT?

09:58.180 --> 09:59.550
WHOA, CHECK IT OUT.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.430
THIS ONE'S MISSING A PLATE.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.430
[ROSE] THE CAR DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE IT'S BEEN
USED IN A WHILE.

10:03.470 --> 10:06.810
AH, LOOK.
TOWNIE CAR RENTAL.

10:06.850 --> 10:09.860
OKAY. LOOKS LIKE THEY
STOLE THE PLATE
OFF OF THIS ONE

10:09.900 --> 10:11.730
AND SWITCHED IT
WITH THE PLATE
ON THE RENTED SUV.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.860
BUT BROKE THE FRAME
OFF IN THE RUSH.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.150
WELL, I GUESS WE
KNOW WHO TO CALL.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.660
NICE WORK, KID.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.750
SO THE SUPERVISOR'S

10:25.790 --> 10:27.540
NEVER HEARD OF
THE ORDER NUMBER,

10:27.580 --> 10:30.210
HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT
THE PARTS
COULD BE USED FOR,

10:30.250 --> 10:32.170
AND OBVIOUSLY HE'S NEVER
HEARD OF YOUR FATHER.

10:32.210 --> 10:33.800
[DES] IF... IF MY TRAINING'S
TAUGHT ME ANYTHING,

10:33.840 --> 10:35.510
I WOULD SAY THAT THIS GUY
IS STEALING GEAR

10:35.550 --> 10:36.720
FROM HIS OWN WORKPLACE.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.840
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.090
[JAKE] NICE EYES.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.720
[DES] EH, THEY HAVE A NICE
COLOR, I GUESS.

10:41.010 --> 10:42.600
NOT HIM. YOU.

10:44.930 --> 10:45.730
THANKS.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.310
OH, MAYBE HE'S STEALING
WHATEVER IT IS

10:49.350 --> 10:50.560
MY DAD'S BEEN TRYING
TO ORDER.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.230
[JAKE] HEY!

10:53.520 --> 10:54.690
HE'S BOLTING!

11:06.660 --> 11:08.540
SORRY, OLD MAN.
TOO SLOW.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.830
ALL RIGHT... BAXTER,
IF THAT IS YOUR REAL NAME.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.250
NOT ONLY DO WE KNOW THAT
YOU'RE A THIEF,

11:13.290 --> 11:15.460
BUT YOU MIGHT ALSO
HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.720
-SO SPILL IT!
-CATTLE DOG?

11:17.760 --> 11:19.680
BRED IN AUSTRALIA
FOR HERDING CATTLE.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.840
WHY... WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
ABOUT A CATTLE DOG?

11:21.890 --> 11:23.680
DES, SHOW HIM
THE ORDER NUMBER, YOU DINK.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.720
YEAH, THE ORDER NUMBER,
YOU DINK.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.850
SEARCH HIM.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.600
WHAT DO YA KNOW?

11:31.650 --> 11:32.860
HEY, BAXTER,

11:32.900 --> 11:33.940
MAYBE WE SHOULD, UH,

11:33.980 --> 11:35.360
YOU KNOW,
TALK TO YOUR BOSS

11:35.400 --> 11:38.110
ABOUT THE ELECTRONICS
YOU'VE BEEN COLLECTING.

11:38.150 --> 11:39.900
[BAXTER] OKAY.
THERE'S THIS GUY,

11:39.950 --> 11:41.280
HE'S COMING BY IN AN HOUR.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.490
AN HOUR.

11:42.530 --> 11:43.950
WELL, WE'LL BE WAITING.
LET'S GO.

11:43.990 --> 11:45.030
YEAH, COME ON.

11:45.660 --> 11:47.120
&lt;SIREN WAILING&gt;

11:52.540 --> 11:53.710
&lt;INDISTINCT TALKING&gt;

11:59.130 --> 12:00.380
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

12:05.180 --> 12:06.310
WHEN WAS
THE LAST TIME

12:06.350 --> 12:08.520
YOU SAW STAFF SERGEANT REESE?

12:08.560 --> 12:11.890
UH, I HADN'T
SEEN HIM IN MONTHS.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.270
ACCORDING
TO HIS CELL PHONE,

12:14.310 --> 12:16.230
YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON
HE CALLED BEFORE HE DIED.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.150
I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HIM.

12:19.740 --> 12:20.900
NOW I WISH I HAD.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.490
&lt;POLICE SIREN&gt;

12:24.910 --> 12:27.490
MAN, YOU COULD BUILD
ALMOST ANYTHING
WITH THESE PARTS.

12:27.540 --> 12:32.540
YOU COULD... LIKE A BLENDER,
A CAR RADIO,
A REMOTE CONTROL.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.670
OR ONE OF THOSE VACUUM
HAIR-CUTTING THINGS.

12:36.090 --> 12:37.920
COULD BE
AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.590
YOU THINK MY DAD WAS
PLANNING TO BUILD A BOMB?

12:39.630 --> 12:41.050
WHY WOULD HE? WHY WOULD
HE BE DOING THIS NOW?

12:41.090 --> 12:43.010
OKAY, JUST
CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

12:43.050 --> 12:44.720
LET'S JUST STAY COOL

12:44.760 --> 12:47.810
UNTIL WE CAN GET A HANDLE
ON WHAT'S ACTUALLY
GOING ON HERE.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.010
WHOA, JAKE, WE GOTTA GO!
WE GOTTA MOVE!

12:49.060 --> 12:52.850
-WE GOTTA GO RIGHT NOW!
-RELAX. SIT DOWN. OKAY?

12:52.890 --> 12:54.310
YOU GOTTA TRUST ME.

12:54.350 --> 12:55.900
IF THE KIDNAPPER'S HERE,
CHANCES ARE

12:55.940 --> 12:57.400
HE DIDN'T BRING
YOUR FATHER WITH HIM.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.480
RIGHT.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.780
-SO?
-SO, OKAY, YES.

13:00.820 --> 13:01.940
WE'LL FOLLOW HIM AND
HE'LL LEAD US TO DAD.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.110
OKAY. I GET IT. I GET IT.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.200
I TOTALLY GET IT.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.700
THAT'S THE KIDNAPPER'S
SIGNATURE MOVE.

13:08.740 --> 13:10.120
HEY! HEY!

13:10.160 --> 13:11.620
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

13:13.000 --> 13:13.830
WAS THAT IT?
I MEAN, IS...

13:13.870 --> 13:15.120
WAS THAT OUR LAST CHANCE
TO GET MY DAD BACK?

13:15.170 --> 13:16.210
RELAX, OKAY?

13:16.250 --> 13:18.130
I PLANTED A GPS
IN ONE OF THE BOXES.

13:18.170 --> 13:19.590
IT'LL LEAD US
RIGHT TO HIM.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.800
THEY DIDN'T TRY
AND HIDE THE BODY.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.050
WHOEVER KILLED HIM DIDN'T MIND
THAT EVERYONE WOULD THINK
IT WAS A MURDER.

13:26.090 --> 13:27.930
YOU THINK SOMEONE WAS
SENDING A MESSAGE?

13:27.970 --> 13:28.930
WE'RE SHORT ON LEADS.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.020
THERE'S NOT A SCRAP OF
EVIDENCE AT THE CRIME SCENE.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.730
SO WHOEVER THIS WAS,
WHOEVER KILLED HIM,

13:33.890 --> 13:35.190
THEY KNEW WHAT
THEY WERE DOING.

13:35.230 --> 13:37.730
DO YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT REESE
THAT COULD HELP?

13:37.770 --> 13:39.570
I HEAR YOU TWO WERE
PRETTY TIGHT ON THE FORCE.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.360
THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.070
IS THIS AN
INTERROGATION, SERGEANT?

13:43.110 --> 13:44.990
NO, I JUST KNOW THAT
YOU USED HIM

13:45.030 --> 13:47.780
FOR ODD JOBS
FROM TIME TO TIME.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.030
HE HELPED US OUT
ONCE OR TWICE,

13:49.070 --> 13:50.870
BUT SO DO A LOT OF PEOPLE.
WE'RE P.I.'S.

13:50.910 --> 13:52.950
DO YOU KNOW IF HE WAS
BEING THREATENED?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.410
DID HE HAVE ANY HABITS THAT
COULD BE RELEVANT?

13:55.460 --> 13:58.670
SORRY, LESLIE.
UH, NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

13:58.710 --> 14:00.880
I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW REESE
HAD SOME TECHNIQUES

14:00.920 --> 14:02.840
THAT WEREN'T
EXACTLY LEGIT, BUT...

14:04.010 --> 14:06.380
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT GOT HIM KILLED.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.970
MAL, I DON'T NEED
TO REMIND YOU

14:08.010 --> 14:10.970
HOW SERIOUSLY THE RNC
TAKES THE DEATH
OF ONE OF OUR OWN.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.270
I'VE BEEN PUT
IN CHARGE OF THIS CASE,

14:14.310 --> 14:15.730
AND I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE IT LIGHTLY.

14:17.850 --> 14:19.610
I HOPE YOU CATCH WHOEVER
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

14:20.810 --> 14:22.570
KEEP ME POSTED IF
YOU FIND ANYTHING.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.700
&lt;ALARM BLARES&gt;

14:27.740 --> 14:28.860
WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?

14:28.910 --> 14:30.120
I... I... I...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.330
LISTEN, I JUST...
I... &lt;STUTTERS&gt;

14:31.370 --> 14:33.080
I CONNECTED
THE RED TO THE...

14:33.120 --> 14:34.870
THIS SHOULD NOT
BE HAPPENING!

14:35.750 --> 14:37.120
DAD! DAD!

14:38.330 --> 14:39.460
JODY?

14:41.130 --> 14:42.500
[DES] DAD, WHAT'S
GOING ON? DAD?

14:43.880 --> 14:45.920
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE, EH?

14:45.960 --> 14:47.340
-DAD!
-SORRY. I'M SORRY.

14:47.380 --> 14:48.720
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:48.760 --> 14:49.890
YOU GOTTA
FORGIVE ME, SON.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.100
DAD! DAD!
TALK TO ME! DAD!

14:51.140 --> 14:52.300
-FORGIVE ME, PLEASE.
-WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

14:53.680 --> 14:54.970
HEY! HEY!

14:55.600 --> 14:56.850
&lt;GROANING&gt;

14:58.060 --> 14:59.940
OH, JAKE. JAKE, ARE YOU
OKAY? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:59.980 --> 15:01.940
OH, HE PUNCHED ME RIGHT
BETWEEN THE LEGS.

15:01.980 --> 15:03.110
LOOK, I THINK
IT'S SAFE TO SAY,

15:03.150 --> 15:04.270
BASED ON WHAT
WE'RE SEEING,

15:04.320 --> 15:06.030
THAT MY DAD
PROBABLY WASN'T
KIDNAPPED.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.070
YOU THINK?

15:10.110 --> 15:14.120
OBVIOUSLY THOSE
ELECTRONICS WEREN'T
BEING USED FOR A BOMB.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.830
BUT WHY WOULD MY DAD
BE BREAKING INTO A...

15:15.870 --> 15:17.080
A PARTY SUPPLY SHOP?

15:17.120 --> 15:19.830
I DON'T THINK IT WAS
THE PARTY SUPPLY SHOP
THAT HE WAS AFTER.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.510
IT'S A HOMEMADE
SECURITY SYSTEM SCRAMBLER.

15:32.550 --> 15:34.010
SOME OF THE PARTS ARE
REALLY HARD TO GET.

15:34.050 --> 15:35.310
YOU NEED TO BE, LIKE...

15:35.350 --> 15:36.680
LIKE A CERTIFIED DEALER.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.980
OR YOU COULD JUST
GET A SKEET TO STEAL
SOME FOR YOU.

15:39.020 --> 15:41.100
DAD'S LIKE
A TECH GENIUS.

15:41.150 --> 15:45.150
AND THIS, THIS CONTRAPTION
IS LIKE SUPER SIMPLE.

15:45.190 --> 15:46.230
SO WHAT?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.360
SO IS MY DAD
A HORRIBLE TECHNICIAN?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.990
OH, DEAR LORD.

15:50.740 --> 15:52.200
A JEWELRY STORE
NEXT DOOR

15:52.240 --> 15:54.030
TO THE PARTY
SUPPLY PLACE.

15:54.070 --> 15:55.780
YEAH. SO WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING, OLD MAN?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.700
THEY BREAK INTO THE PARTY
SUPPLY PLACE,

15:57.750 --> 15:59.790
KNOCK DOWN THE WALL
TO GET INTO
THE JEWELRY STORE.

15:59.830 --> 16:02.040
IT'S A MESSY THING TO DO
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.170
MY DAD WOULDN'T DO THIS.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.210
HE WOULDN'T DO THIS.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.590
I DON'T KNOW HOW I KNOW,
BUT I KNOW.

16:06.630 --> 16:08.630
SOMETHING IS REALLY,
REALLY WRONG HERE.

16:08.670 --> 16:10.630
HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO LEAVE THIS
WHOLE LIFE BEHIND HIM.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.510
AND AS I FEEL I AM REALLY GOOD
AT SEEING MAN'S
TRUE INTENTIONS...

16:15.720 --> 16:16.850
I BELIEVE HIM.

16:16.890 --> 16:18.430
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, I'LL JUST...

16:18.470 --> 16:20.480
I'LL GO TALK TO
LESLIE AND SEE IF SHE CAN

16:20.520 --> 16:22.560
GIVE US ANYTHING ON
THE IDENTITY OF OUR KIDNAPPER.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.100
DON'T MENTION
DAD'S NAME.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.400
OKAY, I'LL BE SUPER VAGUE
ABOUT OUR ROBBER TOO.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.520
IT'S MY FATHER.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.030
I... I'M SORRY, MAL.

16:32.070 --> 16:33.700
NOT THAT YOU'RE
NOT LIKE A FATHER...

16:33.740 --> 16:36.740
I MEAN, YOU ARE LIKE
A FATHER FIGURE TO ME.
I MEAN, ACTUALLY

16:36.780 --> 16:38.910
YOU'RE MORE
LIKE A GRANDFATHER.

16:38.950 --> 16:41.580
I THINK ALL THE STRESS
IS REALLY GETTING
TO ME RIGHT NOW,

16:41.620 --> 16:42.960
AND NOW
I JUST GOTTA PEE, SO...

16:49.800 --> 16:50.880
I NEED
THAT BALLISTICS REPORT

16:50.920 --> 16:52.170
ON REESE NOW PLEASE.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.760
HEY. UH, BAD TIME?

16:55.800 --> 16:57.470
JAKE DOYLE,
WHEN IT COMES TO YOU,

16:57.510 --> 16:59.100
ANY TIME IS A BAD TIME.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.220
WHAT IS WRONG WITH
EVERYBODY?

17:00.270 --> 17:01.850
HONESTLY, IT FEELS LIKE
EVERYBODY AROUND HERE

17:01.890 --> 17:03.440
IS COMPLETELY CONTRARY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:04.730 --> 17:06.230
DIDN'T YOUR
FATHER TELL YOU?

17:06.270 --> 17:07.190
TELL ME WHAT?

17:08.820 --> 17:10.230
YOU KNOW, LESLIE,

17:10.280 --> 17:12.400
BEFORE WHEN YOU USED
TO ALWAYS BE MAD
AT ME IT WAS KIND OF CUTE,

17:12.440 --> 17:13.700
BUT NOW, TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU,

17:13.740 --> 17:16.450
IT'S JUST COMING ACROSS
AS REALLY, REALLY MEAN.

17:16.490 --> 17:17.910
I'M HURT ACTUALLY.

17:17.950 --> 17:20.790
WELL I'M SO SORRY
IF I'M COMING ACROSS
AS MEAN, JAKE,

17:20.830 --> 17:22.200
BUT A COP'S BEEN MURDERED.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.370
RAYMOND REESE.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.920
YOUR FATHER'S OLD FRIEND
AND PARTNER.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.380
RIGHT.

17:28.420 --> 17:30.250
SO FORGIVE ME
IF I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO GO CHASING

17:30.300 --> 17:32.090
AFTER SOMEONE'S MISSING
ICE CREAM TRUCK

17:32.130 --> 17:34.340
OR WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE ON ABOUT.

17:34.380 --> 17:36.300
WELL, IT WAS NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:36.340 --> 17:37.340
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

17:38.390 --> 17:39.430
OUT.

17:40.930 --> 17:42.140
-NOW.
-I'M GOING.

17:44.430 --> 17:45.480
BENNETT.

17:48.310 --> 17:51.070
HOOD! HOW, UH,
HOW'S IT GOING, BUDDY?

17:51.110 --> 17:52.480
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

17:52.530 --> 17:56.110
WHAT? NO BALD JOKES,
NO INSULTS?

17:56.150 --> 17:57.160
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:57.200 --> 17:58.530
WELL, I...

17:58.570 --> 18:00.620
WELL, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD,

18:00.660 --> 18:04.080
UH, JUST GET ME A LITTLE BIT
OF INFORMATION ON THIS GUY.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.170
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S A FELON OF SOME KIND.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.500
WHY DID I
BOTHER STOPPING?

18:07.540 --> 18:09.710
NO, NO, NO. LOOK,
I WAS JUST TALKING
TO LESLIE BENNETT

18:09.750 --> 18:11.250
AND SHE TOLD ME
TO FIND YOU

18:11.300 --> 18:13.710
AND TELL YOU THAT SHE SAID
THAT YOU HELP ME,
YOU KNOW,

18:13.760 --> 18:14.920
GET SOME INFORMATION
ON THIS GUY.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.180
I DON'T BUY IT.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.050
WELL, THEN, YOU CAN ASK
HER YOURSELF
IF YOU WANT, BUT,

18:20.180 --> 18:22.310
SHE'S NOT IN
A VERY GOOD MOOD TODAY.

18:22.350 --> 18:24.480
I DON'T WANT TO
HEAR IT! JUST HURRY UP!

18:26.440 --> 18:27.730
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.100
GOOD MAN. THANKS.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.310
APPRECIATE IT.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.150
JUST FIND OUT WHERE
HE WORKS,

18:31.190 --> 18:32.320
YOU KNOW,
WHERE HE HANGS OUT.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.400
ANYTHING LIKE THAT

18:34.280 --> 18:35.860
MAYBE WE SHOULD... YOU KNOW...

18:37.320 --> 18:38.110
NO.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.410
THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S MY DAD.

18:44.450 --> 18:47.500
YOU MEAN THE WOMAN
WITH THE BLACK HAT?

18:47.540 --> 18:49.630
OKAY, ALTHOUGH
THERE ISN'T MUCH
OF A RESEMBLANCE,

18:49.670 --> 18:50.880
IT COULD BE A DISGUISE.

18:51.710 --> 18:52.750
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM

18:52.790 --> 18:53.960
AND GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.010
JUST HAVE PATIENCE.

18:57.380 --> 18:58.130
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

19:00.260 --> 19:01.930
ARE SOME PEOPLE
JUST BAD?

19:02.510 --> 19:04.600
I MEAN, MAYBE...

19:04.640 --> 19:06.890
MAYBE SOME PEOPLE
CAN'T CHANGE
WHO THEY ARE.

19:06.930 --> 19:10.310
MY DAD ONLY LASTED THREE
HOURS OUT OF JAIL,

19:10.350 --> 19:12.900
AND HE ALREADY IS AFTER
ROBBING A JEWELRY STORE.

19:13.730 --> 19:15.110
MAYBE HE CAN'T HELP IT.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.820
MAYBE IT'S LIKE
A NERVOUS TICK...

19:18.950 --> 19:21.320
EXCEPT WITH ALARMS
AND THE ODD EXPLOSION.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.200
DON'T KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY YET.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.160
LET'S WAIT AND SEE
BEFORE WE RUSH TO JUDGMENT.

19:26.450 --> 19:28.620
BUT IF THIS IS MY DAD,

19:30.290 --> 19:33.540
I MEAN, IF THIS
IS REALLY WHO HE REALLY IS...

19:35.920 --> 19:38.050
THEN WHAT DOES
THAT SAY ABOUT ME?

19:38.090 --> 19:40.470
A MAN CAN'T BE DEFINED
BY WHO HIS PARENTS ARE.

19:42.430 --> 19:43.640
A MAN CAN ONLY BE DEFINED

19:43.680 --> 19:45.600
BY HIS OWN INTENTIONS
AND ACTIONS.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.140
YEAH, YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.850
AND YOUR INTENTIONS AND
ACTIONS, DES COURTNEY,

19:51.480 --> 19:53.270
ARE NOTHING BUT ADMIRABLE.

19:53.310 --> 19:54.360
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

19:57.650 --> 19:58.690
HELLO?

19:58.740 --> 20:01.240

20:01.280 --> 20:02.990
HELLO? WHO IS THIS?

20:03.030 --> 20:04.830
WE NEED TO
TALK ABOUT REESE.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.120
YOU KNOW WE DO.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.740
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

20:07.790 --> 20:08.910
WHAT'S UP?

20:08.950 --> 20:11.120
NOTHING. LET'S GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE.

20:16.170 --> 20:17.340
OKAY, SO THERE WAS ONE

20:17.380 --> 20:18.880
SUV RENTED FROM
TOWNIE CAR RENTALS

20:18.920 --> 20:21.720
IN THE LAST WEEK
TO A MR. MICHAEL ROWE.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.220
MICHAEL ROWE?

20:24.260 --> 20:26.680
HOOD TOLD ME
OUR GUY'S NAME
IS LIONEL HARRIS,

20:26.720 --> 20:28.890
A CAREER CRIMINAL WITH
NO KNOWN WHEREABOUTS.

20:28.930 --> 20:30.310
SO WHO IS MICHAEL ROWE?

20:30.350 --> 20:32.440
WELL, HE'S BEEN DEAD
FOR ABOUT, UH, FIVE MONTHS.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.020
WOW. HE'S GONNA OWE
A FORTUNE IN RENTAL FEES.

20:35.060 --> 20:38.440
WHY WOULD HARRIS BE
PRETENDING TO BE
MICHAEL ROWE?

20:38.480 --> 20:39.900
WHAT DID THIS GUY
DO FOR A LIVING?

20:39.940 --> 20:41.900
UH, WELL, HE WAS
A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE...

20:41.950 --> 20:43.570
HE SEEMS LIKE HE HAD A
PRETTY HIGH CLEARANCE LEVEL.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.700
OKAY.

20:46.580 --> 20:50.410
THEY ORDER TWO OF
EVERY ELECTRONICS PART. WHY?

20:50.450 --> 20:51.370
IN CASE ONE BROKE.

20:51.410 --> 20:53.250
OR THE PARTY SHOP
WAS A DRY RUN.

20:55.540 --> 20:57.540
THEY WERE TESTING
THE SCRAMBLER OUT.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.340
DES, GIVE ME A LIST OF
EVERY BUSINESS IN TOWN

21:00.380 --> 21:03.340
THAT WOULD HAVE THAT
EXACT SAME SECURITY SYSTEM.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.430
I'M WAY AHEAD
OF YOU, DUDE.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.300
OKAY, SO THEY'RE A SMALL
SECURITY SYSTEM,

21:06.340 --> 21:08.310
AND ACCORDING
TO THEIR SITE THEIR...

21:08.350 --> 21:10.470
THEIR CLIENTS INCLUDE

21:10.520 --> 21:13.350
PARTY TIME, THE GLACIER
IN MOUNT PEARL,

21:13.390 --> 21:15.350
UH, DR. SNELGROVE'S OFFICE,

21:15.400 --> 21:16.730
THE CUSTOMS WAY STATION...

21:16.770 --> 21:18.270
[MAL] CUSTOMS WAY STATION?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.320
THERE'LL BE ALL KINDS OF
VALUABLE ITEMS THERE

21:20.360 --> 21:21.860
AWAITING CLEARANCE
BEFORE BEING SHIPPED

21:21.900 --> 21:23.110
OFF TO ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD.

21:23.150 --> 21:25.820
YEAH. AND A HIGH LEVEL
CLEARANCE JOB WOULD MAKE SURE

21:25.860 --> 21:27.450
YOU HAD ACCESS TO WHATEVER'S
COMING INTO TOWN AND WHEN.

21:27.490 --> 21:28.530
THAT'S GOTTA BE
THE TARGET.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.660
OKAY. NICE WORK, DES.

21:29.700 --> 21:30.910
I'LL TRACK DOWN
THE ADDRESS.

21:30.950 --> 21:32.040
DES.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.160
JAKE, WE GOTTA GO.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.120
IN MOST KIDNAPPING CASES
NOT INVOLVING A RANSOM,

21:35.170 --> 21:36.460
THE VICTIM IS KILLED
WITHIN THE DAY.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.830
THE DAY, JAKE. THE DAY!

21:37.880 --> 21:39.920
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
WE ESTABLISHED

21:39.960 --> 21:41.460
THAT YOUR FATHER
HASN'T BEEN KIDNAPPED.

21:41.510 --> 21:42.840
THAT IS A GOOD POINT.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.050
LOOK, JUST BREATHE, BUDDY.
YOU NEED TO STAY HERE...

21:46.090 --> 21:47.930

22:11.580 --> 22:13.040
YEAH. JAKE AND MAL ARE
RUNNING DOWN A LEAD.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.460
CAN YOU COME WITH US?
WE COULD USE YOUR HELP.

22:16.580 --> 22:18.790
NO.
NO, I CAN'T ACTUALLY.

22:18.830 --> 22:20.710

STAY RIGHT HERE.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.380

22:29.850 --> 22:31.850

22:31.890 --> 22:33.560

22:39.230 --> 22:40.310

23:12.180 --> 23:13.640

TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO
KEEP CLEAR,

23:16.930 --> 23:18.390
OR YOUR FATHER IS DEAD.

23:21.190 --> 23:23.940
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SMARTER THAN TO
GET YOUR SON INVOLVED.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.490
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

23:30.490 --> 23:31.530
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

MY DAD'S LIFE IS AT STAKE.

23:33.030 --> 23:34.240
AND PLEASE DON'T
TRY AND STOP ME.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.620
OKAY, FOR THE RECORD,

23:35.660 --> 23:38.330
IF I WANTED TO
STOP YOU I WOULD.

23:38.370 --> 23:41.170
YOU CAN GO,
BUT ONLY IF I COME
WITH YOU.

23:41.710 --> 23:42.790

24:20.960 --> 24:22.290
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

24:22.330 --> 24:23.540
I'M SORRY.
I LEARNED THAT FROM JAKE.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.080
THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS

24:25.130 --> 24:26.130

25:57.180 --> 25:58.510

25:58.550 --> 26:01.060

26:18.780 --> 26:20.160

26:20.200 --> 26:21.870
WHO CARES ABOUT
A JERK LIKE YOU,

26:21.910 --> 26:24.410

26:24.950 --> 26:26.080
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.210
HARRIS SAID THAT
HE'S GOING TO

26:28.250 --> 26:30.170
KILL ME AND DES
UNLESS I GIVE HIM...

26:30.210 --> 26:31.420
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

26:34.710 --> 26:35.970
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

26:37.380 --> 26:38.760
WHAT, WAIT... DAD! DAD!

26:38.800 --> 26:40.010
I'M NOT YOUR DAD, KID.

26:40.720 --> 26:41.680
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

26:46.270 --> 26:47.770
&lt;PANTING&gt;

26:47.810 --> 26:49.150
HE'S GOT MY SON.

26:49.690 --> 26:50.690
DES!

26:56.900 --> 26:58.610
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

26:58.660 --> 27:00.070
MAL! THANK GOD.
IT'S DES.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.570
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE IS HE?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.870
HARRIS GRABBED HIM.

27:02.910 --> 27:04.450
MY GOD! WE NEED
TO FIND HIM, NOW! WE NEED...

27:04.490 --> 27:06.830
-HELLO! I'M, UH, I'M JODY.
-OH.

27:06.870 --> 27:08.580
OKAY, EVERYONE
JUST STAY CALM.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.880
ALL RIGHT? WE'LL FIND DES.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.840
WHY WOULD LIONEL
WANT TO KIDNAP YOUR SON?

27:12.880 --> 27:14.210
WELL, I OWED HIM...

27:15.000 --> 27:17.470
SOME MONEY FROM YEARS AGO,

27:17.510 --> 27:19.720
AND YOU KNOW HOW IT IS,
I COULDN'T PAY IT BACK.
SO, UH...

27:19.760 --> 27:21.430
AND HE WANTED YOU TO
HELP HIM PULL ANOTHER JOB.

27:21.470 --> 27:23.850
EXACTLY. MY PLAN WAS TO
GET OUT OF JAIL

27:23.890 --> 27:25.600
AND THEN LEAVE TOWN
WITH DES

27:25.640 --> 27:26.850
BEFORE HARRIS GOT TO ME.

27:26.890 --> 27:28.060
WELL, YOU MISCALCULATED
THAT ONE.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.730
YEAH. SLIGHTLY.

27:30.310 --> 27:31.520
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT

27:31.560 --> 27:32.810
IF I COULD JUST GET
A STEP ON HARRIS,

27:32.860 --> 27:35.110
BUT HE WAS THERE
SO SOON...

27:35.150 --> 27:36.860
YOU'VE GOT
A LOVELY OFFICE HERE.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.160
YEAH, THANK YOU.
MAL, HONEY, YOU OKAY?

27:41.200 --> 27:42.320
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM,
YOU KNOW.

27:42.370 --> 27:43.910
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-I'M FINE, I'M JUST...

27:43.950 --> 27:45.410
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

27:45.450 --> 27:46.870
GUYS. IT'S DES.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.540
DESSIE, YOU OKAY?

27:49.580 --> 27:50.870
[DES] JAKE, I'M SORRY.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.790
I SHOULD'VE
LISTENED TO YOU.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.000
I'M REALLY SORRY
I LET YOU DOWN,

27:53.040 --> 27:54.250
BUT THERE WAS A CHANCE
I COULD HAVE MADE THIS WORK.

27:54.290 --> 27:55.920
NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT.
WHERE ARE YOU?

27:55.960 --> 27:57.920
OH, AND CAN YOU UNLOCK
TINNY OUT OF
THE SURVEILLANCE VAN,

27:57.960 --> 27:59.470
BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY NOT
GOING TO BE HAPPY... JAKE!

27:59.510 --> 28:00.880
-DES?
-[HARRIS] THERE YOU GO.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.800
I GOT THE KID.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.770
IF YOU WANT TO SEE HIM
AGAIN YOU'D BETTER
GET ME MY CUSTOMS CRATES.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.180
AND HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

28:08.220 --> 28:09.560
NOT MY PROBLEM.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.770
BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

28:10.810 --> 28:12.810
THEY'RE SHIPPING OUT TONIGHT.

28:12.850 --> 28:14.610
HOW'S THIS FOR AN IDEA?

28:14.650 --> 28:17.820
YOU GIVE DES BACK
AND I WON'T GUT YOU
WHILE YOU SLEEP.

28:17.860 --> 28:20.150
JUST DO THE JOB,
HOT SHOT.

28:22.990 --> 28:24.070
HE'S NOT GOING
TO GIVE DES UP UNLESS

28:24.120 --> 28:27.410
WE BREAK INTO THE CUSTOM WAY
STATION AND STEAL HIS CRATES.

28:27.450 --> 28:28.910
HOW DO WE KNOW WHICH
CRATES HE WANTS?

28:28.950 --> 28:30.710
WELL, I SHOULD BE
ABLE TO HELP WITH THAT.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.920
I, UH, I GOT
THE TRACKING NUMBERS.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.340
OH, OKAY.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.960
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING
ELSE ABOUT HARRIS?

28:37.710 --> 28:39.630
WELL, UH...

28:39.670 --> 28:41.340
I, UH, I KNOW A PLACE
WHERE HE SQUATS.

28:42.180 --> 28:43.380
WELL, LET'S GO!

28:44.970 --> 28:47.100
MAL?
BRING HIM BACK, OKAY?

28:47.890 --> 28:48.890
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

28:51.600 --> 28:53.900
-WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-[LESLIE] SORRY, MALACHY?

28:53.940 --> 28:56.520
IT'S LESLIE.
SERGEANT LESLIE BENNETT?

28:57.360 --> 28:58.900
WHO'D YOU THINK I WAS?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.070
SORRY. HOW CAN I...

29:01.110 --> 29:02.860
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, SERGEANT?

29:02.900 --> 29:04.740
I WAS HOPING YOU
COULD COME AND SEE ME.

29:04.780 --> 29:06.320
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
WOULD BE GREAT.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.990
THIS COULDN'T BE
WORSE TIMING.
CAN IT WAIT?

29:09.040 --> 29:11.080
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PUT THIS TO YOU
ANY MORE CLEARLY,

29:11.120 --> 29:12.790
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST.

29:12.830 --> 29:15.290
OH. ALL RIGHT.
I'M ON MY WAY.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.000
SOMETHING'S COME UP.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.550
I'VE GOT TO RUN OUT
AND TAKE CARE OF IT.

29:20.590 --> 29:22.300
TELL JAKE I'LL
MEET UP WITH HIM.

29:32.770 --> 29:33.770
HELLO?

29:34.690 --> 29:36.440
&lt;DOOR CREAKING&gt;

29:36.480 --> 29:39.150
WELL, THIS LOOKS LIKE
HARRIS', UH, HIDEOUT.

29:44.860 --> 29:46.240
UH, JAKE, DO YOU MIND IF

29:46.280 --> 29:49.240
-I ASK YOU SOMETHING,
A FEW THINGS?
-YES, I DO.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.950
WHAT ARE SOME OF
DES' FAVORITE BOOKS?

29:51.870 --> 29:53.290
YOU REALLY THINK
THIS IS A GOOD TIME

29:53.330 --> 29:55.040
TO BE ASKING ME
QUESTIONS ABOUT DES?

29:55.080 --> 29:56.500
DOES HE STILL
LIKE FOOD?

29:56.540 --> 29:57.580
WHAT?

29:57.630 --> 29:58.960
SKATEBOARDS AND COMPUTERS

29:59.000 --> 30:01.550
WERE A PASSION FOR DES.
IS IT STILL SO?

30:01.590 --> 30:02.630
I DON'T KNOW.

30:02.670 --> 30:03.880
DOES HE HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND?

30:03.920 --> 30:05.260
DOES HE STILL SLEEP
UPSIDE DOWN...

30:06.050 --> 30:07.340
IN THE BED, I MEAN?

30:08.090 --> 30:09.260
JODY...

30:10.640 --> 30:12.640
WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME ALL THIS?

30:12.680 --> 30:15.810
WELL, DES NEVER WANTS TO
TELL ME ANYTHING
ABOUT HIMSELF.

30:15.850 --> 30:18.980
ALL HE EVER
TALKS ABOUT IS YOU.

30:20.860 --> 30:21.900
REALLY?

30:25.900 --> 30:27.950
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
HARRIS ISN'T HERE.

30:27.990 --> 30:29.160
[DES] JAKE! HELP!

30:29.910 --> 30:30.950
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

30:38.630 --> 30:39.630
WHAT NOW?

30:42.050 --> 30:42.960
WELL, IF HE HADN'T
HANDCUFFED ME

30:43.000 --> 30:44.170
HE WOULDN'T BE MISSING NOW,
WOULD HE?

30:44.210 --> 30:46.090
OKAY, WELL, THERE'S NO
WAY FOR US TO TELL THAT NOW.

30:46.130 --> 30:47.590
ROSE, WE NEED
TO FIND HIM

30:47.630 --> 30:49.430
SO I CAN MAKE HIM PAY
FOR THAT LITTLE STUNT.

30:49.470 --> 30:51.300
TINNY. OKAY, I KNOW
YOU'RE WORRIED.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.640
JUST STICK TO
THE PLAN, ALL RIGHT?

30:52.680 --> 30:53.930
HERE WE GO.

30:53.970 --> 30:55.060
&lt;DINGS&gt;

30:56.060 --> 30:57.480
MAY I HELP YOU?

30:57.520 --> 30:59.600
YES, UM,
I WAS HOPING TO

30:59.650 --> 31:02.070
SEND THIS PACKAGE
TO MY FAMILY IN CAMBRIDGE.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.030
IT'S... IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
IT'S URGENT.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.070
WE DON'T SEND PACKAGES.

31:06.110 --> 31:08.490
IT'S A HIGHLY SECURE
GOVERNMENT FACILITY,
NOT A POST OFFICE.

31:08.530 --> 31:09.910
WHAT? NO. I...

31:09.950 --> 31:12.830
I WAS SENT HERE
BY A VERY RELIABLE
SOURCE, OKAY?

31:12.870 --> 31:13.950
I WOULD LIKE TO
SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER

31:13.990 --> 31:15.040
AND I'M NOT LEAVING
UNTIL I DO.

31:26.130 --> 31:27.550
&lt;TYPING&gt;

31:29.010 --> 31:31.050
-HURRY UP.
I THINK I HEAR THEM COMING.
-ALMOST DONE.

31:35.180 --> 31:36.430
WOW. HEY!

31:36.470 --> 31:37.770
SORRY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU WERE RIGHT.

31:37.810 --> 31:40.940
UM, I MUST HAVE CONFUSED
WAYBILL WITH WAY STATION.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.110
HA!

31:42.150 --> 31:43.440
YEAH. OH, GOSH,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:43.480 --> 31:45.020
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
A MILLION CALLS

31:45.070 --> 31:47.150
IF I'M GONNA GET
THIS BOTTLED MOOSE

31:47.190 --> 31:49.030
TO CAMBRIDGE BY WEDNESDAY.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.910
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

31:52.070 --> 31:54.200
HEY, IT'S DONE.
I'LL TEXT YOU THE INFORMATION.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.490
YOU SURE THIS
IS GOING TO WORK?

31:55.540 --> 31:58.080
YEAH, WELL, HOPEFULLY
WE WON'T NEED IT.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.540
OKAY,
ANY LUCK WITH DES?

31:59.580 --> 32:00.790
NOT YET,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

32:00.830 --> 32:02.210
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.840
THE CLOCK'S TICKING.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.050
IN MOST KIDNAPPING CASES NOT
INVOLVING A RANSOM,

32:06.090 --> 32:08.170
THE VICTIM IS KILLED THE
FIRST THREE HOURS, JAKE.

32:08.210 --> 32:09.090
THREE HOURS!

32:09.130 --> 32:11.880
OKAY, I KNOW!
RELAX. ALL RIGHT?

32:11.930 --> 32:15.220
THERE'S NO SIGN OF THE SUV.
OBVIOUSLY HARRIS IS GONE.

32:15.260 --> 32:17.140
I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE TRIED TO
RECONNECT WITH MY SON.

32:17.180 --> 32:18.640
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

32:18.680 --> 32:21.640
HARRIS WILL KILL DES IF WE
DON'T GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS.

32:21.690 --> 32:22.980
IT'S TIME FOR PLAN B.

32:24.190 --> 32:26.110
WE GOTTA BREAK INTO
THAT CUSTOMS WAREHOUSE.

32:29.070 --> 32:30.280
NICE JOB, BY THE WAY,

32:30.320 --> 32:31.490
DISABLING THOSE
SECURITY CAMERAS.

32:31.530 --> 32:32.950
OH, HEY, THANKS A LOT.

32:32.990 --> 32:34.820
JUST, CAN YOU
HURRY THIS UP PLEASE?

32:34.870 --> 32:36.530
NOW JAKE, JUST...

32:36.580 --> 32:38.490
I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.040
DES SAID YOU WERE
THE IMPATIENT TYPE.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.420
HE SAID WHAT NOW?

32:42.460 --> 32:44.380
OH, WELL, HE JUST
CASUALLY POINTED OUT

32:44.420 --> 32:45.840
THAT YOU HAVE
ISSUES WITH, UH,

32:45.880 --> 32:47.170
NOT GETTING EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANT,

32:47.210 --> 32:49.340
EXACTLY WHEN YOU WANT IT,
YOU KNOW?

32:49.380 --> 32:50.920
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO WORK ON.

32:52.090 --> 32:53.260
I CAN, UH...

32:53.300 --> 32:54.640
&lt;LOCK BEEPING&gt;

32:54.680 --> 32:56.720
I CAN HELP YOU MEDITATE
ON THAT IF YOU'D LIKE.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.430
I'M GOOD, THANKS.

32:58.470 --> 33:02.640
SO THIS, UH, THIS IS WHAT
SENT YOU TO PRISON, HUH?

33:02.690 --> 33:03.940
WELL, NOT SO MUCH
THE BREAKING IN.

33:03.980 --> 33:06.900
MORE FOR WHAT I STOLE
ONCE I GOT IN THERE.

33:06.940 --> 33:08.690
JUST MAKE SURE YOU DO
IT RIGHT THIS TIME, ALL RIGHT?

33:08.730 --> 33:10.940
OH, I...
I SET THAT LAST ONE
OFF ON PURPOSE.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.200
-YOU RIGGED IT?
-YEAH. OH, I JUST...

33:13.240 --> 33:14.490
I FIGURED IF THE COPS
ARRESTED US,

33:14.530 --> 33:16.160
AT LEAST HARRIS
WOULD GET PUT AWAY,

33:16.200 --> 33:18.370
AND, UH,
HE'D NEVER GET TO DES.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.120
EVEN IF THAT MEANT YOU
GOING TO JAIL YOURSELF?

33:23.660 --> 33:27.170
UH, FREEDOM IS A LOT
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FAMILY, JAKE.

33:27.210 --> 33:28.090
WHA... SORRY?

33:28.130 --> 33:29.460
I MEAN... NO, NO, WAIT.

33:29.500 --> 33:33.170
UH, FAMILY, MUCH
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FREEDOM. FAMILY.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.720
-[JAKE] COME ON.
-&lt;BEEP&gt;

33:37.760 --> 33:39.140
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;

33:42.180 --> 33:46.060
ALL RIGHT,
NOW YOU STAY HERE, OKAY,
AND I'LL GO INSIDE.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.230
NO, NO.
THIS IS FOR DES.
I'M GOING IN.

33:48.270 --> 33:50.900
IF YOU GET CAUGHT,
YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING
BACK TO JAIL.

33:50.940 --> 33:52.820
-I'M GOING IN.
-&lt;SIGHS&gt; FINE.

33:53.610 --> 33:54.700
LET'S DO THIS.

34:05.790 --> 34:07.000
I THOUGHT YOU
FORGOT ABOUT ME.

34:09.790 --> 34:11.090
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS WOMAN?

34:13.630 --> 34:16.630
UH, SORRY.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.600
SOME OF THESE SECURITY CAMERAS
ARE NOT WORTH THE MONEY
YOU PAY FOR THEM.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.720
LOOKS A LOT
LIKE SONJA STERLING.

34:24.350 --> 34:26.980
SHE WAS A ROOKIE WHEN
YOU WERE ON THE FORCE.

34:27.020 --> 34:28.350
YOU, REESE AND HER
WERE PRETTY TIGHT.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.270
HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM SONJA IN YEARS.

34:30.310 --> 34:32.360
LAST I HEARD,
SHE WAS LIVING IN BOSTON.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.280
WHAT WAS SONJA
MEETING WITH REESE ABOUT?

34:34.320 --> 34:36.360
GONNA HAVE TO
ASK HER THAT.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.700
WE WILL
WHEN WE FIND HER.

34:39.280 --> 34:42.200
LISTEN, MAL, WE KNOW REESE
CALLED YOU LAST,

34:42.240 --> 34:43.450
AND NOW I SEE
THAT YOUR TRAINEE

34:43.490 --> 34:44.750
WAS MEETING WITH HIM.

34:44.790 --> 34:45.960
LESLIE...

34:47.160 --> 34:49.290
SERGEANT BENNETT,

34:49.330 --> 34:51.170
WHAT IS IT YOU THINK
I'M GUILTY OF HERE?

34:51.210 --> 34:54.050
MURDER? CONSPIRACY? WHAT?

34:55.590 --> 34:57.470
I DON'T KNOW, MALACHY.

34:57.510 --> 34:59.010
YOU TELL ME.

35:01.010 --> 35:04.310
-YOU SEE, EVERY A-2157
ALARM SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT...
-SHH! I DON'T CARE!

35:04.350 --> 35:06.020
DEPENDING ON THE
NETWORK CONNECTION,

35:06.060 --> 35:07.230
YOU CAN EITHER GET IT
TO BOOT UP

35:07.270 --> 35:10.020
IN FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES,
OR IT CAN TAKE AS MUCH AS 20.

35:10.060 --> 35:11.110
SO...

35:11.150 --> 35:12.860
I DON'T CARE.

35:12.900 --> 35:14.230
WHAT YOU DO IS
YOU TAKE AN...

35:14.280 --> 35:15.780
AN AVERAGE OF THOSE NUMBERS

35:15.820 --> 35:18.240
-AND THEN YOU DIVIDE THAT
INTO THE AMOUNT OF TIME...
-JODY.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.990
LET'S JUST FIND THIS THING
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

35:21.030 --> 35:22.280
-&lt;PHONE VIBRATES&gt;
-HOLD ON.

35:23.950 --> 35:25.620
IT'S A TEXT FROM ROSE.

35:25.660 --> 35:28.620
-OKAY. SHE'S LOCATED
THE CRATES.
-OH, MY...

35:28.660 --> 35:30.920
THEY'RE SOMEWHERE
IN THE SOUTHWEST END
OF THIS BUILDING.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.170
GOD, LOOK AT
THAT TECHNOL...

35:32.210 --> 35:33.750
I'VE MISSED SO MUCH.

35:34.250 --> 35:35.760
YOU KNOW WHAT? WOW.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.010
YOU HAVE GOT TO LEARN
TO RELEASE YOUR STRESS IN A...

35:38.050 --> 35:40.800
IN A MORE POSITIVE
ATMOSPHERE, MAN.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.390
SHUT UP.

35:42.430 --> 35:45.470
OKAY, LOOK, LET'S HURRY UP
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.640

AND I'LL SEARCH
THAT WAY, SEPARATE.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.730
FINE.

36:02.570 --> 36:04.240

-SORRY.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.740

36:25.600 --> 36:27.970
SHH. SOMEONE'S COMING.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.860
&lt;SIGHS&gt; THAT WAS CLOSE.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.280
-HEY.
-SHH.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.490
I THINK I FOUND IT.

36:47.910 --> 36:49.580
-COME HERE.
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:52.420 --> 36:54.000
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

36:54.040 --> 36:55.290
-WILD OR WHAT, HUH?
-SHH.

36:56.460 --> 36:57.420
THAT'S IT.

36:57.460 --> 36:59.010
THAT ALARM'S
GONNA REBOOT ANY MINUTE.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.300
ALL RIGHT, WELL, JUST
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

37:00.340 --> 37:01.550

37:17.570 --> 37:18.940
MORE TOUGH LOVE.

37:18.980 --> 37:20.280
NO, MALACHY,
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

37:21.650 --> 37:23.400
LISTEN TO ME.

37:23.450 --> 37:24.610
IF THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON HERE,

37:24.660 --> 37:26.280
YOU GOTTA TELL ME NOW,

37:26.320 --> 37:27.990
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
FOR ME TO HELP YOU.

37:28.030 --> 37:30.910
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I CAN LOOK AFTER MYSELF.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.420
WHERE IS HARRIS?
WHAT'S TAKING HIM SO LONG?

37:42.510 --> 37:44.430
-OPEN IT.
-ALL RIGHT, B'Y, ALL RIGHT.

37:44.470 --> 37:47.260

UH, LET DES GO FIRST? OKAY?

37:47.300 --> 37:48.800
-YOU HEARD ME.
-OW, WHY...

37:48.850 --> 37:50.510
JAKE, JUST OPEN IT.
YOU HEARD HIM, B'Y.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.850
FINE. I'M OPENING IT.

37:59.520 --> 38:00.820
OPEN THE ONE INSIDE.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.570
YES, B'Y.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.490
GOOD.
NOW PASS ME THE DIAMONDS.

38:09.530 --> 38:10.410
THESE DIAMONDS?

38:13.830 --> 38:16.120
DAD! DAD! DAD! DAD!

38:16.580 --> 38:17.380
AH!

38:17.420 --> 38:18.540
GO AFTER MY SON!

38:18.580 --> 38:19.590
&lt;GRUMBLES&gt;

38:23.380 --> 38:24.550

38:28.470 --> 38:29.890
&lt;SIRENS WAILING&gt;

38:30.930 --> 38:31.930
&lt;GUN COCKING&gt;

38:35.100 --> 38:36.770
I MIGHT NOT
BE WORTH IT, BUT MY SON IS.

38:42.860 --> 38:44.240
WE CAN CUT JODY
A BIT OF A DEAL

38:44.280 --> 38:46.400
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

38:46.450 --> 38:47.950
BUT HE WILL BE
GOING BACK TO PRISON.

38:47.990 --> 38:49.950
WELL, DES IS
NOT GONNA LIKE THAT.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.580
ALTHOUGH I THINK THIS
WHOLE EXPERIENCE

38:52.620 --> 38:56.540
HAS BROUGHT THE TWO OF THEM
EVEN CLOSER TOGETHER,
SO THAT'S GOOD.

38:56.580 --> 38:57.870
LISTEN, I HAVE TO ASK YOU.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.080
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOUR FATHER
TALKED TO REESE?

39:00.130 --> 39:01.880
REESE? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

39:01.920 --> 39:03.130
ASK DAD YOURSELF.

39:03.170 --> 39:04.800
WELL, I ALREADY ASKED
HIM EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO

39:04.840 --> 39:06.590
WHEN I HAD HIM
IN FOR QUESTIONING.

39:06.630 --> 39:07.680
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.390
YOU HAD MY FATHER IN HERE
FOR QUESTIONING? WHY?

39:10.430 --> 39:11.640
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO ASK HIM THAT.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.930
WELL, I'M ASKING YOU!

39:12.970 --> 39:14.810
I'M FOLLOWING
A LEAD, OKAY?

39:14.850 --> 39:17.100
AND MAL ISN'T EXACTLY
BEING FORTHCOMING.

39:17.140 --> 39:18.140
THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY.

39:18.640 --> 39:19.440
RIGHT, WELL...

39:20.560 --> 39:22.520
IF I FIND ANYTHING OUT,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

39:22.940 --> 39:24.070
GOOD.

39:25.990 --> 39:27.280
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

39:27.990 --> 39:29.030
YEAH?

39:29.070 --> 39:30.660
-EVERYTHING GO OKAY?
-WHERE'S DES?

39:30.700 --> 39:31.950
[JAKE] HE'S FINE.

39:31.990 --> 39:34.240
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU ALL DID GREAT WORK.

39:34.290 --> 39:35.410
OH, WHAT A RELIEF.

39:35.450 --> 39:37.120
NOW WHAT ABOUT JODY?

39:37.160 --> 39:38.500
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA

39:38.540 --> 39:40.420
HAVE TO HEAD BACK TO PRISON
FOR A WHILE, BUT...

39:41.000 --> 39:42.040
IT'S FINE.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.250
LISTEN, I GOTTA GO.

39:43.670 --> 39:44.800
HEY!

39:46.590 --> 39:48.340
HEY.

39:48.380 --> 39:50.630
FATHER AND SON REUNITED.
NOT A BAD DAY'S WORK.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.340
-&lt;PHONE CHIMING&gt;
-WHAT THE HELL IS LESLIE

39:52.390 --> 39:53.550
QUESTIONING YOU
ABOUT REESE'S MURDER FOR?

39:54.310 --> 39:55.470
HE WAS AN OLD FRIEND.

39:55.510 --> 39:57.060
THOUGHT I MIGHT KNOW
SOMETHING. I DON'T.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.100
END OF STORY.

40:03.900 --> 40:05.270
HOW'S THE FACE?

40:05.320 --> 40:06.860
FINE. HOW'S THE KNEE?

40:06.900 --> 40:08.190
IT'LL LIVE.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.490
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

40:09.530 --> 40:10.490
I'M A TOTAL KLUTZ.

40:10.530 --> 40:12.700
OH, MY GOD.
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; ME TOO.

40:12.740 --> 40:15.330
I ONCE FELL OFF A BENCH
FROM THE SITTING POSITION.

40:15.370 --> 40:17.870
ACTUALLY, IT HAPPENS
REALLY OFTEN.

40:17.910 --> 40:19.460
IT HAPPENS TO ME
ALL THE TIME!

40:19.500 --> 40:20.660
-COOL.
-&lt;BOTH LAUGHING&gt;

40:22.540 --> 40:24.590
DES, LISTEN. I...

40:24.630 --> 40:27.760
I AM SO SORRY
FOR DRAGGING YOU
INTO MY MESS.

40:28.710 --> 40:30.630
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

40:30.670 --> 40:33.550
AND I KNOW THAT.
IT'S TOTALLY GOOD.

40:33.590 --> 40:36.060
I GUESS I'LL BE
GOING BACK INSIDE
FOR A WHILE.

40:37.430 --> 40:38.600
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

40:39.140 --> 40:40.560
I KNOW THE ROUTINE.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.060
AND I'M FULLY GROWN NOW,

40:44.100 --> 40:45.650
SO YOU WON'T BE
MISSING ANY MILESTONES.

40:45.690 --> 40:47.530
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

40:47.570 --> 40:48.820
YOU'RE A GREAT KID.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.070
I JUST WISH I HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT, YOU KNOW?

40:53.160 --> 40:54.450
NO, YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.200
AND YOU HAVE LOTS OF TIME
TO MAKE IT UP TO ME.
I'LL MAKE A LIST.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.790
THE DOYLES,
THEY'RE A GOOD BUNCH.

41:02.830 --> 41:04.040
YOU SHOULD STICK
CLOSE TO THEM.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.460
OH, THEY'RE AWESOME.

41:08.670 --> 41:11.630
DAD, I'M GLAD.

41:13.590 --> 41:15.090
I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT I HAVE YOU.

41:26.690 --> 41:27.520
&lt;INDISTINCT TALKING&gt;

41:28.690 --> 41:30.650
INTERESTING CHOICE
FOR OUR LITTLE MEETING.

41:32.030 --> 41:33.570
GOOD SCOTCH THOUGH.

41:33.610 --> 41:36.030
YEAH, WELL, I WANTED
AS MANY PEOPLE AROUND
AS POSSIBLE.

41:37.780 --> 41:38.870

41:42.910 --> 41:43.960
TELL ME WE'RE GOOD.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.250

41:48.170 --> 41:49.300
SO YOU'RE
HEADING BACK WEST,

41:49.340 --> 41:50.710
AND I'M NEVER GOING TO
SEE YOU AGAIN, RIGHT?

41:50.750 --> 41:52.670
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KIND OF LIKE IT HERE.

41:53.590 --> 41:55.760
THIS TOWN'S GOT
LOTS OF POTENTIAL.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.800
YOU KNOW,

41:57.850 --> 41:58.970
