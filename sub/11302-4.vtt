- [indistinct commentary on TV]
- [thuds]

00:07.191 --> 00:08.818
Anybody seen my hammer?

00:08.902 --> 00:10.862
Yep, right here.
[clicks tongue]

00:16.033 --> 00:18.369
Using a hammer
to open a twist-off.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.704
You ought to patent that.

00:22.081 --> 00:24.000
I'm goin' to your mother's.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.794
With a hammer?

00:25.877 --> 00:27.546
We gonna be on the news?

00:29.923 --> 00:33.134
When you say
stupid shit like that all day,

00:33.217 --> 00:34.594
do you go to bed proud?

00:36.304 --> 00:37.847
Yes, I do, sir.

00:40.559 --> 00:43.061
Then I do something else in bed,
and I feel ashamed.

00:47.315 --> 00:50.484
Hey. What the hell's going on
with Mom and Dad?

00:50.569 --> 00:51.861
They're still married,

00:51.945 --> 00:54.030
but they don't live together,
but they're still hooking up?

00:54.113 --> 00:56.658
Yeah, I asked Dad once.
He just grunted.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.037
So I asked Mom, she went on this,
like, 45-minute speech.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.664
I couldn't understand
what she was saying, but...

01:03.623 --> 01:06.250
she did use the phrase
"sexual soulmates."

01:06.334 --> 01:07.877
[chuckles]

01:07.961 --> 01:09.671
Hey, you wanna go to the bar
and watch this game?

01:09.754 --> 01:11.255
Nah, I don't really feel like it.

01:12.256 --> 01:13.257
You don't feel like drinking?

01:14.342 --> 01:15.677
Your herpes flaring up?

01:17.929 --> 01:20.389
I'm drinking right now.

01:20.473 --> 01:22.475
Plus, you can drink
when you got herpes.

01:23.559 --> 01:25.519
Ha! You didn't say you don't got it.

01:26.896 --> 01:28.648
- Are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

01:28.732 --> 01:30.734
But I can come back at any time.

01:30.817 --> 01:32.110
Just like your herpes.

01:33.152 --> 01:34.613
[sighs]

01:34.696 --> 01:36.489
Come on, man.
Let's go. [grunts softly]

01:36.572 --> 01:39.200
What? I...
I just said I don't wanna go.

01:39.784 --> 01:43.287
Colt, if you don't wanna go to the bar,
watch football, and get blackout drunk,

01:43.371 --> 01:45.331
then I am genuinely
concerned about you.

01:47.166 --> 01:50.044
[stutters] I just don't wanna
run into Abby, all right?

01:51.630 --> 01:53.715
Why? What'd you do?

01:53.798 --> 01:54.924
Give her herpes?

01:59.721 --> 02:03.307
Yes, I have herpes.

02:05.476 --> 02:07.228
[chuckles]

02:10.231 --> 02:12.108
Enjoy. [laughs]

02:13.652 --> 02:15.654
Joke's on you.
Now you definitely got herpes.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.742
So why don't you wanna see her?

02:21.743 --> 02:24.537
[scoffs] Well, you know, the other night,
we were hanging out. And I...

02:25.454 --> 02:26.915
thought she was giving me a signal,

02:26.998 --> 02:29.417
and I went in for a kiss
and she shot me down.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.544
That's it?

02:32.211 --> 02:34.297
Dude, if I avoided
every girl I tried to kiss,

02:34.380 --> 02:37.258
I couldn't go to the bank,
the dentist, the middle school...

02:40.136 --> 02:42.138
Relax, you pervert,
it was a crossing guard.

02:44.348 --> 02:45.599
Come on, you're comin' or what?

02:45.684 --> 02:47.769
I don't have to go to the bar
to have fun.

02:47.852 --> 02:49.437
Well, we got no more beer
left in the house.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.646
Let's go.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.858
Attaboy.

02:54.818 --> 02:55.944
[Colt laughs] Man.

02:56.027 --> 02:57.737
A crossing guard?

02:58.654 --> 03:00.406
What, you seriously...
You tried to kiss a woman

03:00.489 --> 03:02.826
who was holding a big red sign
that said "stop"?

03:04.577 --> 03:06.537
Yeah. I should have read that sign, too.

03:07.997 --> 03:09.248
She's the one who gave me herpes.

04:20.862 --> 04:23.031
- How's it going?
- Good as new.

04:24.908 --> 04:27.493
Actually, when it was new,
it turned on.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.415
And you wonder why our boys
are such smart-asses.

04:32.498 --> 04:36.753
Maybe I'll just take it apart
and start from the ground up.

04:36.836 --> 04:39.088
Beau, it's 20 years old.
I'll just buy a new one.

04:39.172 --> 04:41.465
So, you're just gonna buy a new one
every 20 years?

04:41.549 --> 04:44.385
They can build these things
to last a thousand.

04:44.468 --> 04:45.845
But they won't.

04:45.929 --> 04:47.513
'Cause of suckers like you.

04:47.596 --> 04:50.683
Yeah, it's either the Global Kitchen
Appliance Cartel,

04:50.767 --> 04:54.187
or the fact that I got high
and tried to microwave a frying pan.

04:55.271 --> 04:56.439
These are for you.

04:57.106 --> 04:58.983
Veggies straight from my garden.

04:59.692 --> 05:02.611
This my punishment
for not fixing your microwave?

05:03.905 --> 05:05.865
Come on, you're supposed to
take care of yourself.

05:05.949 --> 05:07.366
Oh, great.

05:07.450 --> 05:10.661
So the boys are gonna get to have steak,
but the joke's on them.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.122
'Cause I get to have
one of these delicious...

05:14.833 --> 05:15.875
turnips.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.795
What's wrong?

05:18.878 --> 05:21.798
Are you really this upset
about having to eat some vegetables?

05:21.881 --> 05:24.258
- [Beau grunts]
- Also, you're holding a radish.

05:27.303 --> 05:31.182
Hey, you wanna do something
different tonight?

05:31.265 --> 05:35.854
Last time you said that to me,
you made me try some exotic food.

05:35.937 --> 05:37.897
We went to a Mexican restaurant.

05:37.981 --> 05:39.398
You had an enchilada.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.110
No, I was just thinking,

05:42.193 --> 05:45.613
you know, we could use that night
I won at the Marriott.

05:45.696 --> 05:49.117
Hotels are for businessmen
and prostitutes.

05:50.659 --> 05:52.871
Well, we can role play
whatever you want.

05:52.954 --> 05:54.122
[chuckles]

05:54.205 --> 05:57.458
Come on, when was the last time
you did something spontaneous?

05:58.209 --> 06:01.504
Just the other day,
checking out at the feed store,

06:01.587 --> 06:02.713
I bought some gum.

06:04.966 --> 06:06.342
Didn't care for it.

06:07.718 --> 06:10.721
I'm serious. All you do is work.
You deserve a break.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.182
- I don't have a change of clothes.
- Don't need one.

06:13.266 --> 06:15.559
- It's 30 miles away.
- I'll drive.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.770
Vet's coming to the ranch
at 6:30 in the morning.

06:17.853 --> 06:19.438
I can have you home by 6:00.

06:19.522 --> 06:21.649
- I'm going, aren't I?
- I'll get a sweater.

06:24.777 --> 06:25.987
Fuck you.

06:31.409 --> 06:33.244
Well, I'm not gonna put you
on the back of my bike again

06:33.327 --> 06:34.996
if you're gonna scream
like a little girl.

06:36.705 --> 06:38.791
- I was not screaming.
- Please.

06:38.874 --> 06:41.127
[imitating Colt]
"Dude, stop. It's not funny.

06:41.210 --> 06:44.713
Dude, slow down.
It's not funny."

06:46.757 --> 06:48.426
But it was funny.

06:49.593 --> 06:51.304
I was sliding off the back

06:51.387 --> 06:53.973
'cause I was trying to keep my dick
from touching your butt.

06:56.225 --> 06:57.268
Hey, boys.

06:57.351 --> 06:58.394
[both] What's up, Hank?

06:58.477 --> 07:01.605
These are Maggie's sons.
They drink for free.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.982
They'll have three beers.

07:07.778 --> 07:09.155
Well, there's Abby.

07:10.907 --> 07:12.325
Ah, man.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.370
[sighs] I know I gotta talk to her,
but I don't wanna...

07:16.454 --> 07:17.580
[softly] Thanks.

07:17.663 --> 07:20.124
That's 'cause you care about her
and you feel bad about what you did.

07:20.917 --> 07:23.920
Key is, speak from the heart
and tell her the truth.

07:24.003 --> 07:26.797
It'll be tough,
but she'll respect your honesty.

07:28.216 --> 07:29.633
Where the hell did that come from?

07:32.053 --> 07:34.680
Well, I mess around a lot,
but deep down I'm a good guy.

07:35.848 --> 07:37.183
Now, if you'll excuse me...

07:38.101 --> 07:40.686
I'm gonna go tell this chick I got
a ten-inch dong and live in a mansion.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.192
All right, Hank.
Wish me luck.

07:47.276 --> 07:49.946
What's that, Colt?
You want a burger, no onions?

07:56.494 --> 07:57.620
Hey, Abby.

07:58.496 --> 07:59.788
What do you want, Colt?

08:01.290 --> 08:03.834
Would it break the tension
if I said a kiss?

08:06.712 --> 08:08.131
Look. Listen, I'm...

08:08.214 --> 08:10.008
I'm really sorry. I, uh...

08:10.924 --> 08:12.135
I was totally out of line.

08:13.052 --> 08:18.057
I, uh, had too much to drink and
just got caught up in the moment.

08:19.225 --> 08:22.520
Also got caught up
in those big, blue eyes.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.274
Still nothing? Okay.

08:26.357 --> 08:28.651
Uh... Hey, why don't...

08:28.734 --> 08:31.362
Why don't you give me a signal when
you're ready to joke about this again?

08:36.241 --> 08:38.244
Oh! So, we're good.

08:39.745 --> 08:41.746
Look, I'm...
Seriously, I'm...

08:41.830 --> 08:43.291
I'm really, really sorry.

08:45.418 --> 08:47.920
I was an idiot, and I...
I just...

08:48.004 --> 08:49.547
It'll never happen again.
I want to be your friend.

08:49.630 --> 08:53.009
And friends don't do that.

08:53.092 --> 08:55.344
[stutters] It's... it's...

08:55.428 --> 08:57.763
It's time for me to grow up, I suppose.

08:59.265 --> 09:00.683
And why should I believe you?

09:02.601 --> 09:04.687
'Cause you're a better person than I am?

09:06.522 --> 09:08.441
- Now, that I believe.
- [chuckles]

09:09.192 --> 09:12.403
I just... I need you to take
my relationship with Kenny seriously.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.072
Yeah, absolutely.

09:14.155 --> 09:16.032
Even though he was in the band?

09:16.115 --> 09:19.785
[stutters] Hey!
There are a lotta cool Kennys in bands.

09:21.079 --> 09:24.082
There's Chesney, Loggins...

09:25.124 --> 09:26.542
- G.
- [laughing]

09:27.418 --> 09:29.795
- There it is.
- [chuckles]

09:29.878 --> 09:32.340
Hey, come on, we...
we good to start over or what?

09:32.423 --> 09:34.675
Yeah, yeah.

09:34.758 --> 09:36.760
But I'm serious about this.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.180
Kenny's my boyfriend
and nothin' is gonna change that.

09:39.263 --> 09:40.723
Message received.

09:42.058 --> 09:44.268
- Okay. We can start over.
- Good.

09:44.352 --> 09:46.395
I'm Colt Bennett.
Are you single?

09:46.479 --> 09:48.481
What?

09:48.564 --> 09:50.149
[chuckles]

09:50.233 --> 09:53.152
Hey, Colt.
Ms. Phillips! Cute top.

09:53.236 --> 09:54.903
Oh, yeah...

09:54.987 --> 09:56.072
Hi, Heather.

09:56.155 --> 09:57.365
Oh. Wow!

09:58.282 --> 10:01.452
Uh, you two know each other?

10:01.535 --> 10:03.162
Wait, you two know each other?

10:04.413 --> 10:06.582
Yeah, Ms. Phillips was my history teacher.

10:06.665 --> 10:08.126
And Colt and I hooked up.

10:09.585 --> 10:12.588
- [Colt chuckles]
- Okay, good to know.

10:13.589 --> 10:15.508
But to be clear,
we did not...

10:15.591 --> 10:17.260
We did not...
we didn't fully hook up.

10:17.343 --> 10:19.512
- We just... we hung out.
- [Abby] Mmm.

10:19.595 --> 10:22.223
Yeah. Plus, his dad walked in
right when we were about to do it.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.229
So, Heather, how have you been
since the last time I saw you?

10:28.312 --> 10:31.149
Four years ago... in high school.

10:32.858 --> 10:35.068
My ID totally worked. [chuckles]

10:35.153 --> 10:36.237
Hi, I'm Nikki.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.782
We know each other, Nikki.
You had me for tenth grade history.

10:40.949 --> 10:42.243
Twice.

10:43.369 --> 10:45.829
Tenth grade history, twice.
I hear that.

10:47.706 --> 10:49.667
Hey, dude, I got a text from Dad.

10:50.793 --> 10:51.794
Hey.

10:52.711 --> 10:53.712
Rooster.

10:54.630 --> 10:55.756
'Sup?

10:57.341 --> 11:00.303
Anyway, uh, Dad said he's taking Mom
to the Marriott near Telluride.

11:00.386 --> 11:03.096
[chuckles] Oh, my God,
that's where we had prom last year.

11:03.806 --> 11:05.516
[chuckles] Awesome.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.186
[chuckles] Very awesome.

11:09.978 --> 11:12.190
So the house is empty.
You guys down to hang?

11:12.273 --> 11:14.650
Does a three-legged dog
swim in a circle?

11:18.196 --> 11:20.573
I... I don't know.

11:22.283 --> 11:25.453
Was he born without the paw?
'Cause if he was, he might've adapted.

11:27.580 --> 11:28.872
Hey, uh, you and Kenny wanna come?

11:28.956 --> 11:31.417
Nah, sorry, I can't. We're...
I'm actually waiting for him.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.752
We're gonna bring some food to his mom.
She's not feeling well.

11:33.836 --> 11:35.629
Oh. Kenny's in.
He's gonna bring beer.

11:37.089 --> 11:38.799
I guess we could stop by.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.637
Man, I wish my parents
would go out of town.

11:43.721 --> 11:45.097
I'd love to throw a party.

11:45.180 --> 11:48.434
Am I the only one here
that doesn't live with their parents?

11:55.358 --> 11:56.525
[beeps]

12:00.195 --> 12:01.655
[beeps]

12:01.739 --> 12:03.699
It's broken. Let's go home.

12:03.782 --> 12:05.451
Just give it to me.

12:05.534 --> 12:08.036
You know, the government uses
those electronic cards

12:08.120 --> 12:09.747
to track your movements.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.791
Really? So they know
we're at the Marriott?

12:14.585 --> 12:15.711
Ta-da!

12:15.794 --> 12:17.170
I loosened it for you.

12:18.464 --> 12:20.007
Wow, look!

12:20.090 --> 12:22.343
It's bigger than my Airstream.
[chuckles]

12:23.969 --> 12:25.137
What's that smell?

12:26.138 --> 12:27.765
I don't know, clean?

12:29.057 --> 12:30.684
Look, they gave us a bottle of wine.

12:30.768 --> 12:32.144
Don't touch that.

12:32.227 --> 12:34.522
Sometimes they charge you
just for moving it.

12:34.605 --> 12:36.189
[clicks tongue]

12:36.274 --> 12:37.816
There's a note from Kenny.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.485
Nice. Who's Kenny?

12:39.568 --> 12:41.111
Abby's boyfriend.

12:41.194 --> 12:44.031
He's the manager here.
He gave us the free stay.

12:44.114 --> 12:46.158
Oh, right.
And who's Abby?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.744
Colt's ex-girlfriend.

12:49.662 --> 12:50.996
Colt's your son.

12:59.254 --> 13:02.090
The window's broken.
It'll only open four inches.

13:03.008 --> 13:04.176
I think I can fix it.

13:05.428 --> 13:06.720
The window's fine.

13:06.804 --> 13:08.639
Come on, what do you wanna do first?

13:09.515 --> 13:12.017
- I just wanna relax.
- Okay.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.436
[grunts]

13:14.227 --> 13:15.228
[clicks]

13:16.104 --> 13:17.315
Well, that did it.

13:20.443 --> 13:23.028
Ooh, they gave us robes.

13:23.111 --> 13:26.031
Look, 700-thread count.

13:26.114 --> 13:28.033
What does that mean?

13:28.116 --> 13:31.078
One thread for each person
who's worn it before you?

13:34.164 --> 13:37.042
Wow! We got a Jacuzzi tub.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.878
Maybe we could take a bath together later.

13:39.962 --> 13:41.547
[indistinct commentary on TV]

13:44.257 --> 13:46.469
Or you could watch TV.

13:46.552 --> 13:48.220
The one thing you can do at home.

13:48.303 --> 13:51.932
Oh, that's not true.
At home, we don't get the Weather Channel.

13:52.015 --> 13:55.268
Ooh. Big low pressure system
pushin' through Nebraska.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.360
- [Colt] Oh!
- [Heather chuckles]

14:02.443 --> 14:05.070
All right. You miss this,
it's game over.

14:05.153 --> 14:06.530
Oh, I never miss.

14:07.490 --> 14:08.741
- [Rooster grunts]
- [Colt] Mmm.

14:08.824 --> 14:10.451
Whoo! Suck it, Nikki. [chuckles]

14:10.534 --> 14:12.370
[chuckles] No, you suck it, Heather.

14:13.496 --> 14:14.622
All right. This is hot.

14:15.623 --> 14:17.500
I know. I'm pissed.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.209
I should've rented a trampoline.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.506
All right, Heather, we're up.

14:23.589 --> 14:25.090
It's you and me
against Kenny and Abby.

14:25.173 --> 14:27.092
By the way, Kenny,
that's a great haircut.

14:27.175 --> 14:28.344
Aw, thanks!

14:28.427 --> 14:29.720
He noticed.

14:33.015 --> 14:34.307
All right, Kenny.

14:34.392 --> 14:38.186
Eye on the prize, all right?
If we win now, you win later.

14:39.104 --> 14:40.230
Oh. [chuckles] She's kidding.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.650
We have an appropriate
amount of sex either way.

14:44.610 --> 14:47.530
You know, that's definitely
a tough choice. But, I mean...

14:47.613 --> 14:49.782
junior college lasts,
what, like, two years?

14:51.074 --> 14:52.701
Breast enlargement lasts forever.

14:54.537 --> 14:57.039
So, dating a 22-year-old?

14:57.122 --> 14:58.331
Pretty awesome, bro!

14:58.416 --> 14:59.542
Oh, easy.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.334
We ain't dating.
We're just having fun.

15:01.419 --> 15:02.711
Oh, I'm sure you are.

15:03.671 --> 15:05.631
You know, actually,
Heather's really interesting.

15:05.714 --> 15:06.715
Oh, I know.

15:06.799 --> 15:10.302
I read her paper on why slavery was
"like, totally not a cool thing."

15:11.929 --> 15:13.806
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

15:14.890 --> 15:16.975
- [clunk]
- Oh. Nice toss, Heather.

15:18.185 --> 15:20.145
You guys have a lot in common?

15:20.228 --> 15:21.564
Yeah. Yeah.

15:22.523 --> 15:25.484
We both like pizza
and we both...

15:26.318 --> 15:28.320
- live in Garrison.
- [both chuckle]

15:28.404 --> 15:29.780
We both hate slavery.

15:30.698 --> 15:33.158
- Wow, solid foundation.
- Shut up.

15:33.241 --> 15:36.036
[chuckles] Kenny! Focus! God!

15:37.871 --> 15:39.790
What do you care so much for?

15:41.124 --> 15:42.751
I was hoping you were
looking for something serious.

15:42.835 --> 15:44.044
Like an actual relationship.

15:44.127 --> 15:45.713
I mean, you're almost twice her age.

15:45.796 --> 15:48.090
[chuckles] Oh, God, you're right.

15:49.341 --> 15:50.801
That's a bad thing.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.095
- That's a very bad thing.
- [chuckles]

15:54.638 --> 15:56.432
You are unbelievable.

15:57.641 --> 15:59.893
Hit the damn board, Kenny!

15:59.977 --> 16:01.479
Sorry, sweetie.

16:01.562 --> 16:02.938
You should switch to water.

16:03.021 --> 16:04.565
Maybe you should blow me.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.991
Hey, why are you so interested
in my relationship with Heather?

16:14.074 --> 16:16.827
Oh. [chuckles] I don't think
what you have is a relationship, Colt.

16:16.910 --> 16:18.036
It's more like a playdate.

16:18.746 --> 16:20.498
How do you know?
I mean, she might be the one.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.709
What's her last name?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.920
Maybe it'll be Bennett.
[clears throat]

16:28.130 --> 16:29.214
[sighs]

16:29.297 --> 16:31.842
- That was a nice throw, Kenny.
- [siren wailing]

16:31.925 --> 16:33.218
Cops!

16:34.386 --> 16:37.222
Hey, hey. If they ask,
she's 21, all right?

16:37.305 --> 16:40.518
[Billy over PA]
<i>Everybody put your hands in the air...</i>

16:40.601 --> 16:43.311
<i>and wave 'em
like you just don't care!</i>

16:44.062 --> 16:45.438
The hell?

16:46.273 --> 16:48.817
- What up, boys? [chuckles]
- [laughing] Beer Pong!

16:48.901 --> 16:50.611
- He's cute.
- [Colt] Hey, how we doing, boss?

16:50.694 --> 16:52.362
Nikki has a thing for cops.
[chuckles]

16:52.445 --> 16:54.239
It's true. I do.

16:55.908 --> 16:58.368
What about people
who have been on the show <i>Cops?</i>

17:00.370 --> 17:02.414
Took off my shirt and my pants.

17:06.794 --> 17:08.837
Beau, what happened to you?

17:08.921 --> 17:10.798
I thought you were gonna
meet me in the bar.

17:10.881 --> 17:14.926
There's a guy down here who's been
talking on his phone for a half hour.

17:15.010 --> 17:16.386
What?

17:16.469 --> 17:19.848
There's a guy in the parking lot
talking on his phone.

17:19.932 --> 17:22.017
Who talks on the phone
for a half an hour?

17:23.018 --> 17:25.896
Who watches somebody
talk on the phone for half an hour?

17:27.064 --> 17:28.774
Yeah, he's up to something.

17:28.857 --> 17:31.026
He's wearing a suit and no belt.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.365
Come on. We haven't had
a night away in years.

17:37.449 --> 17:39.409
This is our chance to have fun,

17:39.492 --> 17:42.955
not watch some beltless guy
in a parking lot eating a sandwich.

17:43.038 --> 17:44.665
He's eating a sandwich now?

17:47.167 --> 17:49.545
He was having a piece of pizza
a half hour ago.

17:50.713 --> 17:53.215
Hey, why don't we
try out that Jacuzzi now?

17:54.925 --> 17:58.220
Where do you think those businessmen
take the prostitutes?

18:00.263 --> 18:03.058
[sighs] For once,
can we do something I wanna do

18:03.141 --> 18:04.977
without you making a fuss?

18:05.060 --> 18:06.519
I'm here, aren't I?

18:06.604 --> 18:09.982
I was just hoping
we could enjoy a night together.

18:10.065 --> 18:11.650
I'm enjoying myself.

18:12.693 --> 18:14.945
You're enjoying yourself.
What's the problem?

18:15.028 --> 18:17.280
The problem is,
you're completely oblivious.

18:18.406 --> 18:21.534
Do you remember when I wanted
to go away for my 50th?

18:21.619 --> 18:22.911
Yeah. We went away.

18:22.995 --> 18:25.538
To Denver!
To a cattle auction!

18:25.623 --> 18:27.875
Those were registered cows, Maggie.

18:27.958 --> 18:30.502
You can trace their lineage back
ten generations.

18:30.586 --> 18:32.545
You know how rare that is?

18:33.589 --> 18:35.674
That was a memory
we can share forever.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.928
Why do all the memories we share
have to involve cows?

18:40.012 --> 18:41.722
We always do what you wanna do.

18:41.805 --> 18:44.391
Are we really having
this conversation again?

18:44.474 --> 18:47.310
Do you have any idea
what I like to do?

18:47.394 --> 18:48.896
Apparently not.

18:48.979 --> 18:50.397
[sighs and chuckles]

18:50.480 --> 18:53.150
I don't know why I keep thinking
it's gonna be different.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.568
This is why we can't live together.

18:55.653 --> 18:58.947
We can't live together
because you moved out to run a bar.

18:59.489 --> 19:01.199
You really think that, don't you?

19:01.283 --> 19:03.535
I know when you started
running that thing,

19:03.619 --> 19:05.412
when you were asleep,
I was waking up,

19:05.495 --> 19:07.247
and when I was awake,
you were going to bed.

19:07.330 --> 19:08.916
You were never there.

19:08.999 --> 19:10.292
Oh, Beau,

19:10.375 --> 19:12.377
even when you were there,
you were never there.

19:12.460 --> 19:14.129
And that was long before the bar.

19:14.212 --> 19:17.049
You would work yourself to the bone
to save that ranch,

19:17.132 --> 19:19.885
but you won't lift a finger
to save this relationship.

19:21.053 --> 19:22.930
You knew who I was
when you married me.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.391
No. You were not this person
when I married you.

19:27.309 --> 19:32.856
You used to surprise me,
you used to be romantic, actually.

19:32.940 --> 19:34.274
You used to try.

19:36.068 --> 19:37.235
We should just go.

19:38.570 --> 19:39.863
Seriously?

19:39.947 --> 19:42.574
That's your response
to this whole thing?

19:42.658 --> 19:43.701
[Maggie sighs]

19:43.784 --> 19:44.952
You know what?

19:45.035 --> 19:48.246
I came here to have a good time
and that's what I'm going to do.

19:48.330 --> 19:50.290
You can do whatever you want.

19:50.373 --> 19:53.794
I'm going to put on that robe,
have a glass of wine,

19:53.877 --> 19:58.381
turn on those Jacuzzi jets,
and have myself a good old time.

20:14.022 --> 20:15.440
Now I get it.

20:16.566 --> 20:17.985
It's so I don't jump.

20:20.612 --> 20:23.448
Who wants to do a shot...
from my mouth?

20:25.283 --> 20:26.326
[both] I do.

20:27.619 --> 20:29.412
What the hell, man?
I brought her here.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.581
What the hell, man?
I have a gun.

20:34.001 --> 20:35.668
You're using your holster
to hold a beer.

20:35.753 --> 20:37.921
[chuckles] Yeah.
Pretty cool, huh?

20:38.839 --> 20:40.673
Wait, where's my gun?

20:42.760 --> 20:44.261
Anyone gonna do this?

20:45.053 --> 20:46.764
Whoa, déjà vu.

20:46.847 --> 20:48.390
This is how I ended up on <i>Cops.</i>

20:50.976 --> 20:53.478
Ms. Phillips, do you wanna
do a shot out of my mouth?

20:53.561 --> 20:54.813
[scoffs]

20:56.940 --> 20:58.233
I'm gonna pass.

20:59.442 --> 21:01.069
It's okay, honey.
You can do it.

21:01.904 --> 21:03.781
You know, I respect that, Kenny.

21:03.864 --> 21:04.990
[chuckles] Yeah.

21:05.073 --> 21:08.869
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna make out
with a 22-year-old.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.830
I'll leave that to Colt.

21:12.956 --> 21:16.960
You know what? Actually,
I don't think you need to take a shot.

21:17.795 --> 21:20.338
Hey, uh, who's up
for a friendly game of beer pong?

21:20.422 --> 21:21.714
Does a three-legged dog...

21:21.799 --> 21:23.133
Just say yes.

21:25.052 --> 21:26.136
Are you okay?

21:26.219 --> 21:27.595
Yeah. I'm fine.

21:27.679 --> 21:30.849
I mean, do I have to take a shot
from a girl's mouth to have a good time?

21:30.933 --> 21:33.476
[stutters] No, you don't have to,

21:33.560 --> 21:35.687
but no one would
judge you if you did.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.024
You see Abby?

21:39.107 --> 21:42.152
The only thing I saw was Nikki's thong
poking up from her jeans.

21:44.529 --> 21:46.782
It's calling my name
every time she bends over.

21:47.825 --> 21:48.826
"Rooster.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.414
Come get me."
[chuckles]

21:55.248 --> 21:58.961
I'm telling you, all Abby's doing
is talkin' shit about Heather.

21:59.044 --> 22:00.212
Meanwhile, at the bar, she told me

22:00.295 --> 22:02.297
I gotta respect her relationship
with her and Kenny.

22:02.380 --> 22:05.300
And the guy tucks his T-shirt
into his jeans.

22:05.383 --> 22:06.885
He probably wears
socks with his sandals.

22:06.969 --> 22:09.679
He's a fanny pack away
from being a German tourist.

22:12.515 --> 22:15.602
First of all, there's nothing wrong
with tucking your T-shirt into your jeans.

22:15.685 --> 22:16.979
That's just class.

22:17.896 --> 22:19.147
And second, that's girls, man.

22:19.231 --> 22:21.441
They get all weird and jealous
when they see you with somebody else.

22:22.567 --> 22:23.861
It's like Hilary from the Dairy Queen.

22:23.944 --> 22:25.362
She did not give me the time of day

22:25.445 --> 22:27.280
until she caught me
with Wendy from the gas station.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.450
Okay. Okay. So what did you do?

22:30.533 --> 22:32.410
[stutters] You dumped Wendy
to be with Hilary?

22:32.494 --> 22:33.661
Hell, no.

22:33.745 --> 22:35.705
Had myself a threesome
and a Butterfinger Blizzard.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.752
Well, I ain't gonna have a threesome
with Heather and Abby.

22:40.835 --> 22:42.545
Not with that attitude, you're not.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.424
You're not helping at all.

22:46.967 --> 22:48.010
Look, man.

22:48.093 --> 22:50.178
You got a hot chick out there,
you know, who wants to bone you.

22:50.262 --> 22:52.555
What are you doing, worrying about
the one with a boyfriend?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.183
See, you couldn't have just led with that?

22:56.935 --> 22:58.061
I mean, I could have,

22:58.145 --> 23:01.398
but then I wouldn't have gotten a chance
to tell you about my threesome at the DQ.

23:04.234 --> 23:06.861
Oh, Billy, found your gun.

23:11.366 --> 23:12.492
Whoa.

23:12.575 --> 23:14.327
Surprise.

23:15.078 --> 23:16.204
What are you doing?

23:16.288 --> 23:17.705
I'm trying.

23:19.582 --> 23:20.750
Thank you.

23:23.921 --> 23:26.006
Your robe's on inside out.

23:26.089 --> 23:27.299
Yeah, well...

23:28.383 --> 23:30.677
I figured less people
wore it this way.

23:35.307 --> 23:40.228
Look, I know I'm not the easiest person
to live with, Mags...

23:44.024 --> 23:47.027
No need to pause.
I'm not gonna disagree.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.824
I've raised a couple of thousand
head of cattle...

23:54.242 --> 23:58.663
but you raised our boys
without much help from me.

24:00.665 --> 24:03.335
You put up with a lot
and complained very little.

24:05.462 --> 24:08.423
I never meant
to take advantage of that.

24:10.008 --> 24:11.426
I'm sorry.

24:11.509 --> 24:12.760
[sighs]

24:14.221 --> 24:15.973
We've tried it my way for 40 years.

24:17.349 --> 24:20.893
Maybe we can try it your way for...
tonight.

24:20.978 --> 24:22.354
[scoffs]

24:23.896 --> 24:25.148
All right.

24:25.232 --> 24:28.901
It might be the wine talking,
but I'll take it.

24:30.237 --> 24:31.989
I appreciate this.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.535
[breathes deeply]

24:37.619 --> 24:38.953
Tea with milk.

24:40.122 --> 24:41.623
What?

24:41.706 --> 24:44.251
Tea with milk.
It's one of those things you like.

24:46.961 --> 24:51.633
You also like books you gotta listen to
and movies you gotta read.

24:52.634 --> 24:53.635
[snickers]

24:55.470 --> 25:00.350
And you like the quiet
after the first snowfall of the year.

25:10.860 --> 25:13.738
Beau, can we turn
the Weather Channel off?

25:16.741 --> 25:19.952
I've never gotten drunk in the back
of a cop car before. [chuckles]

25:20.037 --> 25:21.371
[chuckles] Yeah. Me neither.

25:21.454 --> 25:23.040
I've gotten sick in a few.

25:23.123 --> 25:25.667
Little tip, the windows do not roll down.

25:25.750 --> 25:26.751
Oh...

25:27.669 --> 25:28.961
Mmm...

25:29.046 --> 25:31.339
- Want another?
- I never say no.

25:32.340 --> 25:34.717
All right, I'll go get those beers.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.262
Think of a few more questions for you.

25:37.345 --> 25:38.555
[chuckles]

25:42.225 --> 25:43.560
Hey, Colt.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.896
Hey, I, uh...
I just wanted to say thanks.

25:47.897 --> 25:50.692
- For what?
- Inviting us over.

25:50.775 --> 25:53.820
I know it could've been awkward and weird
between you, me, and Abby, but...

25:53.903 --> 25:56.198
you've been really cool about it.
So, thanks. [chuckles]

25:58.616 --> 25:59.784
You're a good guy, Kenny.

26:00.702 --> 26:01.911
I'm glad I got to know you.

26:02.912 --> 26:05.540
Thanks, Colt.
You're a good guy, too. [chuckles]

26:07.625 --> 26:09.169
All right, we ain't gonna hug.

26:09.252 --> 26:10.337
Right, right.

26:21.139 --> 26:22.224
Hey.

26:23.641 --> 26:24.976
You okay?

26:25.852 --> 26:27.437
Yeah. [scoffs]

26:27.520 --> 26:29.522
I just needed a second. [chuckles]

26:30.523 --> 26:32.234
Why do you have two TVs?

26:36.571 --> 26:39.991
We have two TVs,
but there's only one on that wall.

26:41.743 --> 26:44.746
In case you're wondering,
there ain't two deers up there, either.

26:46.623 --> 26:48.250
"Deer," not deers.

26:48.333 --> 26:51.043
The plural of "deer" is "deer."

26:51.128 --> 26:52.462
- D-E-E-R.
- [chuckles]

26:52.545 --> 26:55.840
Man, even when you're wasted,
you're smarter than me.

26:55.923 --> 26:57.509
[chuckles]

26:58.426 --> 27:00.011
I'm smarter than
your girlfriend, too. [chuckles]

27:00.595 --> 27:02.639
- Oh, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Maybe...
- Mmm!

27:02.722 --> 27:05.225
- Maybe we don't need that, huh?
- [both chuckle]

27:07.269 --> 27:08.395
- All right...
- [sighs]

27:08.478 --> 27:11.022
Come on.
What's your problem with Heather?

27:13.233 --> 27:15.318
- She's a child.
- [scoffs]

27:16.278 --> 27:17.279
Okay.

27:18.112 --> 27:21.741
You told me to move on.
I'm doing that.

27:21.824 --> 27:24.744
But it seems you got a problem
with that, too. So, why don't you...

27:24.827 --> 27:26.996
Why don't you tell me who in this town
is Abby-approved?

27:27.079 --> 27:28.456
No. I'm not...
I'm not gonna do...

27:28.540 --> 27:29.874
I'm not gonna tell you
who you should date.

27:29.957 --> 27:31.793
Oh, just...
just who I can't?

27:33.670 --> 27:36.464
Seriously, is there anybody out there
that you're okay with me being with?

27:36.548 --> 27:38.175
Or do you just want me to be
miserable and alone?

27:38.258 --> 27:40.092
I don't want that!

27:40.177 --> 27:41.594
No, I just...

27:45.807 --> 27:47.309
I think that you deserve better.

27:50.061 --> 27:51.771
Sometimes better is taken.

27:55.733 --> 27:56.776
[softly] Whoa.

27:58.445 --> 27:59.612
Maybe I'll get you a water.

28:01.364 --> 28:02.449
[whispers] Okay.

28:02.532 --> 28:04.826
[stuttering] You know I wanna do that.

28:08.830 --> 28:11.666
God knows, I wanna do that, all right?

28:11.749 --> 28:15.837
[stuttering] It's like,
you're drunk and I'm...

28:15.920 --> 28:17.922
You're in a relationship.
And that...

28:18.005 --> 28:19.966
that Kenny, he's a...
he's a good guy.

28:20.049 --> 28:22.219
Hell, he's better than me.

28:22.302 --> 28:24.679
I mean, sure,
that T-shirt thing is weird.

28:26.889 --> 28:29.642
Look. I mean, you asked me to mature,

28:29.726 --> 28:31.894
and that's what I'm doing.

28:39.402 --> 28:41.613
If this ever does happen...

28:42.655 --> 28:44.199
I don't want it to be
something you regret.

29:00.965 --> 29:02.634
Wait. Why am I being arrested?

29:02.717 --> 29:04.802
I'm the only one here
that doesn't live with their parents!

29:06.888 --> 29:09.516
Oh, you're fine.
Billy's gonna get you home safe.

29:09.599 --> 29:11.559
Thanks again, it was a lot of fun.

29:11.643 --> 29:13.228
Sorry about your wastebasket.

29:15.104 --> 29:16.273
Hey, Billy.

29:16.356 --> 29:18.233
- You good to drive?
- Oh, yeah.

29:18.316 --> 29:21.736
I just checked myself out.
.04, I'm good to go.

29:23.530 --> 29:25.907
Besides, who's gonna pull me over in this?

29:27.784 --> 29:29.827
- I want to ride in the cop car.
- You do?

29:29.911 --> 29:31.037
Can I play with the siren?

29:31.120 --> 29:32.664
Yeah, you can!

29:35.041 --> 29:36.501
You ever shot a gun?

29:38.127 --> 29:39.379
[car door closing]

29:39.462 --> 29:41.005
[siren wailing]

29:41.839 --> 29:43.550
[Billy over PA] <i>Suck it, Rooster!</i>

29:47.845 --> 29:49.514
Her going with him.
Such bullshit.

29:49.597 --> 29:51.433
Yeah. Yeah.

29:51.516 --> 29:52.517
Hey...

29:53.142 --> 29:55.562
Abby tried to make
a move on me in there.

29:56.396 --> 29:57.647
You serious? What happened?

29:58.565 --> 30:00.149
Well, I did the mature thing.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.609
You wore a condom?

30:03.445 --> 30:06.155
No! I told her it wasn't right.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.325
Then I covered her with a blanket
and I left.

30:09.784 --> 30:11.202
Maybe you are getting mature.

30:12.161 --> 30:13.496
Maybe I am.

30:15.540 --> 30:16.749
[both] Whoa!

30:18.460 --> 30:20.127
Colt, you wanna do me
on the tractor?

30:21.921 --> 30:23.005
Yes, I do.

30:24.507 --> 30:26.759
Girl, what happened to your shirt?

30:26.843 --> 30:29.095
- Do you really care?
- Nope. [clears throat]

30:32.807 --> 30:34.642
Screw this.
I'm going to the Dairy Queen.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.522
