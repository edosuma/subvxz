Previously on <i>Yellowjackets...</i>

00:02.277 --> 00:03.736
What the fuck, Lottie?

00:03.736 --> 00:05.989
She was whispering
weird shit to my baby.

00:05.989 --> 00:07.490
It's a boy.

00:07.490 --> 00:08.950
It's you and me against
the whole world.

00:08.950 --> 00:11.286
You fucking ate my baby!

00:11.286 --> 00:12.996
I saw you!
You were covered in blood!

00:12.996 --> 00:14.956
Shauna, we need you. Let it out.

00:18.501 --> 00:21.337
I am at a residential
wellness center.

00:21.337 --> 00:22.714
Where you're getting help?

00:22.714 --> 00:24.674
Where everyone is getting help,

00:24.674 --> 00:27.844
from one Charlotte Matthews.

00:27.844 --> 00:29.220
Where'd you say that place was?

00:29.220 --> 00:30.513
Shauna's phone.

00:30.513 --> 00:32.682
Lottie is running
a wellness center.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.851
I'm on my way there right now.

00:34.851 --> 00:36.477
I think you should go.

00:36.477 --> 00:39.147
<i>I thought Lottie
was barely coherent.</i>

00:39.147 --> 00:40.857
Why do you want to up your meds?

00:40.857 --> 00:42.692
<i>I started having visions</i>

00:42.692 --> 00:44.861
<i>for the first time in decades.</i>

00:44.861 --> 00:47.488
<i>I'm not worried that I'm ill.</i>

00:48.406 --> 00:51.451
I'm worried that
I've never been ill.

00:51.451 --> 00:52.452
I think you should all go home.

00:52.452 --> 00:53.453
No.

00:53.453 --> 00:54.787
We just got here.

00:54.787 --> 00:56.122
I think it might be time

00:56.122 --> 00:58.166
for you to stop resisting.

01:02.378 --> 01:04.797
Charlotte.
Sorry to interrupt, uh...

01:04.797 --> 01:06.341
There's an urgent call
for one of your guests.

01:06.341 --> 01:07.383
For who?

01:07.383 --> 01:08.509
<i>Shauna. Hey.</i>

01:08.509 --> 01:11.054
<i>Do you recall that missing man?</i>

01:11.054 --> 01:12.472
The authorities believe

01:12.472 --> 01:14.724
<i>they found his remains</i>

01:14.724 --> 01:18.019
<i>buried at
Hacklebarney State Park.</i>

01:18.019 --> 01:19.520
It is sending
your old friends to you.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.648
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

01:21.648 --> 01:23.233
You tell me.

01:23.233 --> 01:26.110
<i>Does a hunt that has
no violence feed anyone?</i>

01:35.245 --> 01:36.913
Okay.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.748
All right, we got you.

01:38.748 --> 01:40.750
Okay, just...

01:40.750 --> 01:42.585
...try to relax

01:42.585 --> 01:45.797
and just let it go. Okay?

01:45.797 --> 01:47.131
Yeah, good, Lottie.

01:47.131 --> 01:49.592
Good, good.

01:49.592 --> 01:51.886
Oh, there's... there's blood.

01:51.886 --> 01:55.890
It could be an infection,
maybe in her kidneys.

01:55.890 --> 01:57.016
Oh, it stinks.

01:58.434 --> 02:00.937
Shauna kicked her pretty hard.

02:00.937 --> 02:02.772
Then maybe Shauna
should be doing this.

02:02.772 --> 02:04.190
Okay.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.901
Easy. Easy. Easy, easy.

02:06.901 --> 02:08.861
Okay.

02:08.861 --> 02:11.114
Okay.

02:14.450 --> 02:16.286
God, it's making my eyes water.

02:16.286 --> 02:18.913
Oh, my God. Would you
shut up about the pee?

02:18.913 --> 02:21.291
God. She is in danger, here.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.793
And after everything
that she's done for us.

02:23.793 --> 02:26.421
But no, you have
to be a little brat,

02:26.421 --> 02:27.964
just like you always are.

02:27.964 --> 02:30.091
You know what?
If you're so grossed out by it,

02:30.091 --> 02:32.385
just take it downstairs
and empty it.

Hey.

03:22.852 --> 03:25.188
Can you hear me?

03:29.650 --> 03:31.402
Get the door.

03:36.657 --> 03:39.410
Hey.

03:39.410 --> 03:42.205
Hi, Nugget.

03:42.205 --> 03:44.916
When we get home, I'm gonna
have you meet my baby nephew.

03:44.916 --> 03:47.502
But don't worry, he's gonna
be super gentle with you.

03:47.502 --> 03:49.170
I'll make sure of that.

03:49.170 --> 03:51.839
And then
we'll go to the beach,

03:51.839 --> 03:54.509
and we'll get french fries
soaked in vinegar,

03:54.509 --> 03:56.052
and funnel cakes.

03:56.052 --> 03:58.471
And then I'll buy you
your own little house,

03:58.471 --> 04:00.932
with tubes
for you to run through.

04:00.932 --> 04:04.060
Oh, and we'll get you
a wheel for exercise.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.187
How does that sound?

04:06.187 --> 04:07.647
What's that in your hands?

04:07.647 --> 04:09.357
- Oh, nothing.
- Let me see it.

You cannot touch him! He's mine!

04:15.947 --> 04:18.741

Jeff, uh, just told me
that the police, uh,

06:41.676 --> 06:46.013
found the body
of our friend Adam Martin

06:46.013 --> 06:49.225
in Hacklebarney Park.
It was on the news.

Oh, wow. Shauna, that's...

06:52.228 --> 06:54.981
It's really fucking unfortunate.

06:54.981 --> 06:58.401
Is he positive that
they said "Adam Martin"?

06:58.401 --> 06:59.485
Yeah.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.778
Who's Adam Martin?

07:00.778 --> 07:04.240
Uh, just some guy Shauna knew.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.450
Yeah. So, uh, Lottie,

07:06.450 --> 07:08.327
thank you so much for having me

07:08.327 --> 07:10.621
at your place and, um,

07:10.621 --> 07:13.874

to be with my family. Okay.

Shauna. Uh, don't you think the
better plan is to stay here?

07:24.802 --> 07:26.429
We have some stuff
to figure out.

07:26.429 --> 07:29.557
No. I ne--
I need to get home, Nat.

07:29.557 --> 07:31.100
I don't understand.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.269
You measured the grave
to the standard six feet?

07:33.269 --> 07:34.604
Well, I didn't have
a fucking tape measure.

07:34.604 --> 07:36.397
But yeah,

07:36.397 --> 07:37.940
he was in there really deep.

07:37.940 --> 07:39.233
I should have done it myself.

07:39.233 --> 07:41.569
So, okay, you guys
didn't know him?

07:41.569 --> 07:42.945
Not really.

07:42.945 --> 07:44.697
Well, what's with
the panic vibe, then?

07:44.697 --> 07:46.866
No one's panicked, uh,
except Shauna, and sh--

07:46.866 --> 07:48.367
Her friend just died.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.703
Well, why are Misty

07:51.829 --> 07:53.623

07:53.623 --> 07:55.541
You're lying to me.

07:56.751 --> 07:59.045
And I want to know why.

Did you guys have
something to do with this?

08:07.928 --> 08:09.013
Fine.

I'm starting to feel
like it, yeah.

08:23.110 --> 08:24.654
We haven't seen each other
in years,

08:24.654 --> 08:27.865
and clearly there's
something going on here

08:27.865 --> 08:31.369
with you four that you're
not being honest about.

08:31.369 --> 08:32.953
So no, nobody's going anywhere

08:32.953 --> 08:34.914
until you tell me
and Lottie what's going on.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.499
And obviously
it was important enough

08:36.499 --> 08:38.668
for Jeff to call you here.

08:38.668 --> 08:41.462
So, what, you both
knew this Adam person well?

08:41.462 --> 08:45.633
Yeah. Shauna, why is Jeff
the one calling you about this?

08:45.633 --> 08:47.677
Does he know something about it?

08:47.677 --> 08:51.764
About it? You guys fucking
did this, didn't you?

08:51.764 --> 08:52.973
Shauna, answer the question.

08:52.973 --> 08:55.685
Yes, okay? Yes, I told him.

08:55.685 --> 08:58.771
He knows about
the-the "Adam incident."

08:58.771 --> 09:00.940
I was very specific
about my instructions.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.274
- Why would you tell him?
- That was so fucking stupid.

09:02.274 --> 09:03.901
So Jeff can know
what's going on.

09:03.901 --> 09:05.611
Oh, my God.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.571
Okay. S-Stop. It's all right.

09:08.823 --> 09:10.074
- That's bullshit.
- Okay, ladies.

09:10.074 --> 09:12.952
We have a lot to discuss here,

09:12.952 --> 09:16.539

is not the place.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.874

09:18.874 --> 09:21.919

Lottie took it from her
to protect us.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.855
Don't let that be for nothing.

11:11.153 --> 11:14.490
Maybe Lottie dying
wouldn't be the worst thing.

11:14.490 --> 11:17.827
I mean,
if she's in pain, then...

11:18.869 --> 11:20.830
Yeah, maybe for the best.

11:20.830 --> 11:23.624
Everyone's just so...

11:23.624 --> 11:27.878

because of her.

11:29.547 --> 11:34.009
she has some weird control
over them or something.

11:35.177 --> 11:36.720
Sounds like you're jealous.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.681
Right.

11:38.681 --> 11:42.351
Even Javi's gone
to the dark side.

11:42.351 --> 11:45.187
Oh, come on, Nat.
He doesn't even talk.

11:45.187 --> 11:47.481
He doesn't have to.

11:47.481 --> 11:52.945
I saw him, like, bowing to
a symbol tree the other day.

11:56.323 --> 11:57.783

she's now officially a suspect.

14:33.522 --> 14:36.734
Well, let's get
to tossing, boys.

14:38.027 --> 14:39.361
Hey.

14:41.822 --> 14:44.199
- Mind if I ask a few questions?
- Yeah.

14:44.199 --> 14:46.577
Yeah.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.668
So, who are we pretending
to be today, Matt?

14:54.668 --> 14:56.420
Two more up, and you'll
hit my panty drawer.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.422
Gonna take a sniff, creep?

14:58.422 --> 15:01.216
Don't worry, there's only
one deviant in this room.

15:01.216 --> 15:02.676
Nice try lying to my partner

15:02.676 --> 15:04.928
about how we slept together,
by the way.

15:04.928 --> 15:07.264
It didn't work,
but I applaud the effort.

15:07.264 --> 15:10.100
The other just-as-problematic
cop has your back.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.560
Congratulations.

15:13.854 --> 15:15.731
And who has yours?

15:15.731 --> 15:17.149
Mommy Dearest?

15:17.149 --> 15:18.984
Good luck with that in court.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.737
All a jury needs
to hear is how you,

15:21.737 --> 15:26.283
an old-ass man, seduced me,
a teenage girl.

15:29.953 --> 15:34.249
How you... preyed on a child.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.003
Oh, yeah?

15:38.003 --> 15:40.172
'Cause I think when they
get a whiff of how much

15:40.172 --> 15:41.590
of a liar your mom is,

15:41.590 --> 15:43.759
they'll realize that
the psychopath apple

15:43.759 --> 15:48.347
doesn't fall far from
the fucked-up, man-eating tree.

15:52.267 --> 15:55.646
So, uh, do I, like, call
a lawyer now, or...

15:55.646 --> 15:57.606
You Sadeckis, you're
always asking about lawyers.

15:57.606 --> 15:58.899
Makes it seem like
you're hiding something.

15:58.899 --> 16:00.943
Well, we're not.

16:00.943 --> 16:02.611
Yeah.

16:03.612 --> 16:06.156
So, uh, where is Shauna anyway?

16:07.699 --> 16:12.955
Uh, Shauna's at, uh, a spa with
a few of her, uh, girlfriends.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.834
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:16.834 --> 16:19.586
Yeah, it's one of these,
like, new-agey spas,

16:19.586 --> 16:22.756
with the massages and the,
you know, the sound baths.

16:22.756 --> 16:24.591
It's all that shit, you know?

16:24.591 --> 16:26.885
I thought maybe you, um...

16:26.885 --> 16:29.680
you'd kicked her out after
she admitted to the affair.

16:30.973 --> 16:34.726
So much for that, uh,
that unconditional trust.

16:36.687 --> 16:39.064
We're figuring it out.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.482
Mr. Sadecki.

16:42.359 --> 16:44.945
We wanted to show you
a few photos.

16:44.945 --> 16:47.072
Okay.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.740
I'm not gonna
sugarcoat it, man.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.242
They're pretty gruesome.

16:56.707 --> 16:58.292
My goodness.

16:58.292 --> 17:00.878
Decomp really started to set in.

17:00.878 --> 17:02.296
Mm.

17:02.296 --> 17:05.507
But not so bad we couldn't tell

17:05.507 --> 17:09.887
how cleanly he was dismembered.

17:09.887 --> 17:11.555
See here?

17:11.555 --> 17:12.598
Those marks on the bone
were created

17:12.598 --> 17:14.600
by a serrated blade.

17:14.600 --> 17:18.437
But the separation
of limbs was precise.

17:18.437 --> 17:20.147
Surgical, almost.

17:20.147 --> 17:22.941
Very hard to achieve
with an electric kitchen knife.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.903
Well...

17:25.903 --> 17:27.696
Well, I mean,
there you go, guys.

17:27.696 --> 17:30.866
Th-There is no way that
Shauna could have done this.

17:30.866 --> 17:33.327
She's no doctor.

17:33.327 --> 17:38.498
But she does have
certain... survival skills

17:38.498 --> 17:40.959
that would lend themselves
to a situation like this.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.836
Jeff, whoever did this

17:42.836 --> 17:46.715
had the foresight to remove
his head, feet and hands. Okay?

17:46.715 --> 17:48.217
Mm.

17:48.217 --> 17:51.345
They even used something
to take off his tattoos.

17:51.345 --> 17:54.473
The coroner thinks it was
a fucking cheese grater.

17:54.473 --> 17:55.974
Mm.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.644
Made it almost impossible
to identify him.

17:58.644 --> 18:01.146
Well, then how do you even
know that this is the guy

18:01.146 --> 18:02.773
that you were looking for?

18:02.773 --> 18:04.358
I said "almost."

18:04.358 --> 18:05.776
They did a bone
marrow test, Jeff.

18:05.776 --> 18:07.569
A friend of his had cancer
a few years ago,

18:07.569 --> 18:08.946
and Adam donated his marrow.

18:14.409 --> 18:18.372
Okay. Uh... Yeah.

18:18.372 --> 18:20.791
You know what, guys?
This is... Uh, we're done.

18:20.791 --> 18:23.085
Jeff, listen.

18:23.085 --> 18:24.419
I know she's your wife,

18:24.419 --> 18:25.921
but I got to level with you,

18:25.921 --> 18:27.839
'cause this is some
really fucked-up shit.

18:27.839 --> 18:29.675
Did you ever think
Shauna could be capable

18:29.675 --> 18:31.218
of something like this?

18:31.218 --> 18:34.054
I'm not gonna say
another word without a lawyer.

18:34.054 --> 18:35.764
You don't have
to protect her, you know.

18:35.764 --> 18:36.765
There's still time
for you to get out of this.

18:36.765 --> 18:38.350
You and Callie.

18:41.144 --> 18:42.437
Okay.

18:47.985 --> 18:49.945
<i>intriguing music</i>

18:54.741 --> 18:58.954
So, this is what you've all
been doing with your lives?

18:58.954 --> 19:01.790
Chasing blackmailers
and murdering lovers?

19:01.790 --> 19:05.877
Mm. Well, that's a little reductive.

19:05.877 --> 19:09.589
I think we can agree that it's
in everyone's best interest

19:09.589 --> 19:12.968
that Adam is, uh, gone.

19:12.968 --> 19:14.594
But especially yours, right?

19:14.594 --> 19:16.555
Right, 'cause I'm
the only one here

19:16.555 --> 19:19.391
who has secrets that he
was threatening to reveal.

19:19.391 --> 19:21.476
So you just
decided to share more

19:21.476 --> 19:23.437
of our secrets
with your fucking husband.

19:23.437 --> 19:26.398
I...
I was scared and...

19:26.398 --> 19:28.817
feeling really fucking crazy.

19:28.817 --> 19:30.861
I just needed Jeff on my side.

19:30.861 --> 19:33.655
We all need things
we can't have, Shauna.

19:33.655 --> 19:35.490
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:35.490 --> 19:38.493
Is that what you were telling
yourself when this happened?

19:38.493 --> 19:41.121
How did you two find
each other again, anyway?

19:41.121 --> 19:43.665
That was easy.
Tai just hitched a ride

19:43.665 --> 19:45.667
on an 18-wheeler to my place.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.127
That was totally normal.

19:47.127 --> 19:49.921
I thought you said
that you had lost touch,

19:49.921 --> 19:51.923
that you didn't even
know where she lived.

19:51.923 --> 19:54.259
It's not that hard to find that
kind of thing out these days.

19:54.259 --> 19:58.180
Yeah. I've had Van's
address for years.

19:58.180 --> 20:01.266
You could've just asked me
instead of outsourcing.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.268
Would've been so much cheaper.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.520
I didn't.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.358
Hold on. What do you mean
"outsourcing"?

20:13.070 --> 20:14.529
You want to tell them, or...?

20:14.529 --> 20:18.367
Okay. I guess I will. Um...

20:19.368 --> 20:21.995
Tai is the one
who hired Jessica Roberts

20:21.995 --> 20:23.580
to look into all of us.

20:23.580 --> 20:24.581
Who?

20:24.581 --> 20:26.541
Jesus Christ, Tai.

20:26.541 --> 20:29.336
I hired her for oppo
research, that's it.

20:29.336 --> 20:32.422
You paid somebody
to dig into our past?

20:32.422 --> 20:34.674
Are you fucking kidding?

20:34.674 --> 20:37.052
Have you forgotten what
she could've found out?

20:37.052 --> 20:39.054
I needed to know
you weren't gonna talk

20:39.054 --> 20:40.514
if someone made the right offer.

20:40.514 --> 20:42.015
And fuck, Shauna, it's not like

20:42.015 --> 20:44.267
- you couldn't use the money.
- Oh, fuck you.

20:44.267 --> 20:46.353
I mean, Natalie is a fucking
drug addict. Look, I--

20:46.353 --> 20:48.647
I just needed to know
I could trust you guys.

20:48.647 --> 20:50.982
Trust <i>us?</i> Oh, the irony.

20:50.982 --> 20:53.819
Seriously, what if she
decides to go rogue?

20:53.819 --> 20:56.488
Oh, we don't have
to worry about that.

20:56.488 --> 21:00.242
Okay. How do you know this, exactly?

21:00.242 --> 21:01.660
'Cause I took care of it.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.578
Like I always do.

21:03.578 --> 21:05.497
Oh, my God, Misty.

21:05.497 --> 21:08.458
So, you're welcome.

21:17.884 --> 21:19.094
Hey, Ben.

21:19.094 --> 21:21.596
That knife is really sharp.

21:22.806 --> 21:24.933
Do I need to be
worried about this?

21:24.933 --> 21:26.268
No.

21:27.644 --> 21:29.771
You see, I'm just...

21:29.771 --> 21:32.107
making my crutches
a little more snow-friendly.

21:32.107 --> 21:36.653
Look, Misty, if I
was gonna do anything,

21:36.653 --> 21:38.989
why would I be putting in
the effort?

21:40.824 --> 21:44.828
That's, um, that's really
good. You know?

21:44.828 --> 21:48.123
Some fresh air can help
clear the bad thoughts.

21:48.123 --> 21:49.749
Exactly.

Okay, okay.

Just try to take

23:26.680 --> 23:28.139
like you have us
do all the time, okay?

23:28.139 --> 23:29.140
Nice, deep breath in.

24:49.554 --> 24:52.098
Well, what was I supposed
to do, let her go?

24:52.098 --> 24:54.934
I'd already held her captive
in my basement for like a week.

24:54.934 --> 24:57.729
Sounds like your hands
were really tied.

24:57.729 --> 24:59.439
Oh, wait, maybe those
were her hands.

24:59.439 --> 25:02.609
Look, the only reason I
kidnapped her in the first place

25:02.609 --> 25:04.611
was 'cause I thought
she was the blackmailer.

25:04.611 --> 25:07.113
I was... trying to protect us.

25:07.113 --> 25:08.657
Little did I know that, meanwhile,

25:08.657 --> 25:10.158
Shauna was being seduced

25:10.158 --> 25:12.285
by this adorable grifter
whose only real intent

25:12.285 --> 25:15.830
was to get his mitts on her
old journals and extort us.

25:15.830 --> 25:17.832
Why am I the only bad guy

25:17.832 --> 25:21.127
when Misty has been holding
someone captive in her dungeon?

25:21.127 --> 25:23.838
And the FBI
has been going around

25:23.838 --> 25:24.839
asking questions about Natalie.

25:24.839 --> 25:26.591
The FBI?

25:26.591 --> 25:27.592
What?

25:27.592 --> 25:29.719
Okay, stop. Just stop.

25:30.804 --> 25:32.347
The FBI was me.

25:32.347 --> 25:37.185
Technically, it was my boyfriend
Walter Tattersall.

25:37.185 --> 25:41.189
Well, we were trying to find
out who had kidnapped Natalie,

25:41.189 --> 25:44.651
and we knew that Randy had
been staying at the same motel,

25:44.651 --> 25:47.612
so Walter impersonated
an FBI agent

25:47.612 --> 25:50.865
and interrogated Randy
on his boat.

25:50.865 --> 25:52.992
Walter's boat, not Randy's boat.

25:52.992 --> 25:56.579
Misty, you are nothing
if not proactive.

25:56.579 --> 25:58.373
Thank you?

25:59.999 --> 26:03.586
It wasn't a terribly
fruitful interrogation,

26:03.586 --> 26:04.921
at least not at first.

26:04.921 --> 26:07.590
He was, like,
paralyzed with fear,

26:07.590 --> 26:12.220
which is strange...
for an innocent man.

26:16.391 --> 26:18.560
And then he, he mentioned Jeff.

26:21.271 --> 26:23.982
I mean, they're best friends,
so probably...

26:23.982 --> 26:28.653
No, it was more like in a,
in a worried way.

26:28.653 --> 26:30.739
Like...

26:30.739 --> 26:33.742
like they had done something
that he was nervous about.

26:33.742 --> 26:37.704
And I didn't really give it
much thought at the time,

26:37.704 --> 26:42.250
but there's another person
who had access

26:42.250 --> 26:43.918
to those journals
the whole time.

26:43.918 --> 26:46.379
You found glitter
in your bedroom closet.

26:46.379 --> 26:48.381
You assumed it was
from Adam, but, really,

26:48.381 --> 26:51.718
it makes a lot more sense if...

26:51.718 --> 26:53.303
it was from Jeff.

26:55.138 --> 27:00.310
Shauna, was Jeff
the one who sent the postcard?

27:00.310 --> 27:04.939
Was your fucking husband
the one blackmailing us?

28:53.965 --> 28:55.884
Well, I was, but...

28:57.677 --> 28:58.887
...with everything
that's been going on,

28:58.887 --> 29:01.514
I just needed us
to be together, Jeff.

29:02.557 --> 29:06.102
You're the only one
who really understands me.

29:16.070 --> 29:17.572
Oh, Shauna.

29:21.910 --> 29:23.202
Ow! Ow.

29:23.202 --> 29:25.455
Oh. Sorry, babe.

29:29.709 --> 29:31.044
What the fuck?

29:32.337 --> 29:34.589
What happened to your hands?

29:34.589 --> 29:38.384
Oh. Don't pretend
that you don't like this.

29:38.384 --> 29:40.595
Why the fuck would I like it?

29:40.595 --> 29:42.263
Because it's exciting.

29:43.681 --> 29:46.351
No! No. No, it is not.

29:46.351 --> 29:49.103
It is fucking dangerous.

29:49.103 --> 29:50.438
Now get rid of it.

29:50.438 --> 29:52.023
I can't get rid of it.

29:52.023 --> 29:53.942
These are a part of me.

29:53.942 --> 29:55.610
I thought you loved all of me,

29:55.610 --> 29:57.528
like I love all of you.

29:57.528 --> 30:00.365
I... I'm scared.

30:00.365 --> 30:04.285
Just relax, or you'll
end up like Adam did...

30:04.285 --> 30:06.621
buried in the park,

30:06.621 --> 30:10.291
no head, no feet, no hands.

30:10.291 --> 30:14.170
Skin grated off
like a rind of pecorino.

30:14.170 --> 30:16.631
No.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.487
I...

30:40.738 --> 30:42.740
I couldn't sleep.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.743
That's not gonna help.

30:56.754 --> 30:57.880
Dad?

30:57.880 --> 30:59.257
Yeah?

31:01.300 --> 31:03.177
Am I like Mom?

31:03.177 --> 31:05.346
Well, sure, yeah.

31:05.346 --> 31:07.515
I mean, you're smart.

31:07.515 --> 31:10.268
And you're-you're
good at stuff, and...

31:10.268 --> 31:11.352
you don't take any shit.

31:11.352 --> 31:13.062
That's not what I mean.

31:14.981 --> 31:17.608
Mom is, like,
seriously fucked up.

31:17.608 --> 31:19.569
Well...

31:22.780 --> 31:24.365
She is.

31:24.365 --> 31:26.325
Look...

31:26.325 --> 31:30.204
your mom went through a lot out
there in the wilderness, Cal.

31:30.204 --> 31:33.541
I mean, s-she lost a lot
of people... her best friend.

31:33.541 --> 31:35.710
Yeah. Jackie. I know.

31:35.710 --> 31:37.336
Yeah, Jackie.

31:39.714 --> 31:42.133
She lost somebody else
out there, too.

31:46.763 --> 31:49.307
She had a baby out there.

31:51.142 --> 31:53.227
It was our baby.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.939
It was hers and mine.

31:57.940 --> 32:00.193
We, uh...

32:00.193 --> 32:02.820
She was pregnant
when that plane went down.

32:04.864 --> 32:06.741
J-Jesus.

32:10.203 --> 32:13.039
So, like, I had a-a sister?

32:13.039 --> 32:15.374
A brother.

32:15.374 --> 32:18.628
Yeah. She had a baby...

32:20.254 --> 32:22.423
...a little baby boy.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.636
Oh, my God.

32:28.304 --> 32:32.308
Hey. Listen...

32:32.308 --> 32:37.230
my point here
is that all that stuff,

32:37.230 --> 32:40.191
all right, that's
your mom's burden to bear.

32:41.526 --> 32:43.861
And mine, too, I guess.

32:44.821 --> 32:48.991
But you don't have
to make it yours, okay?

32:51.619 --> 32:54.122
Come here, come here.

32:54.122 --> 32:56.332
Hey.

32:56.332 --> 32:58.918
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

33:47.175 --> 33:49.093
She's, um...

33:55.516 --> 33:58.394
She said that if...

33:58.394 --> 34:00.354
if she dies...

34:01.856 --> 34:04.192
...she wants us to
make use of her.

34:05.651 --> 34:07.028
To stay alive.

34:08.821 --> 34:10.698
Did she really say that?

34:10.698 --> 34:13.534
She must
be really fucking sick.

34:13.534 --> 34:15.870
I can't imagine being
here without her.

34:17.830 --> 34:19.665
Me, either.

34:19.665 --> 34:22.293
Then let's not.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.879
Lottie isn't gonna die.

34:24.879 --> 34:27.548
The wilderness
won't let her die.

34:27.548 --> 34:32.470
It may not want her to,
but if she's starving...

34:32.470 --> 34:34.931
there's no way she's gonna live.

34:36.057 --> 34:39.769
The same is true for all of us.

34:42.271 --> 34:43.731
Okay.

34:43.731 --> 34:45.691
We need to find
a way to stay alive.

34:47.109 --> 34:49.487
And it can't be her.

34:50.738 --> 34:52.114
You lied to me.

34:52.114 --> 34:54.242
I didn't know
what else to do, okay?

34:54.242 --> 34:56.244
I thought that if you guys
knew the truth,

34:56.244 --> 34:58.788
you-you might actually
try to kill him.

34:58.788 --> 35:00.498
That's insane, Shauna.

35:00.498 --> 35:04.293
Is it? I mean, Misty
"took care of" the person

35:04.293 --> 35:06.045
she thought was the blackmailer.

35:06.045 --> 35:09.465
Exactly. And who knows,
you might have done something

35:09.465 --> 35:10.841
to him while you were asleep.

35:10.841 --> 35:13.511
No. You are not
putting that on us.

35:13.511 --> 35:16.597
We put ourselves
in danger for you.

35:16.597 --> 35:18.266
You've been using us!

35:18.266 --> 35:21.936
I'm sorry, okay?
I really, truly am.

35:21.936 --> 35:24.855
I don't know what
has been happening to me.

35:24.855 --> 35:27.441
I guess I-I started seeing Adam

35:27.441 --> 35:30.111
to try to shake things up, or...

35:30.111 --> 35:32.738
And because I thought
Jeff was...

35:32.738 --> 35:35.783
It doesn't matter.
Um, anyway, ever since then,

35:35.783 --> 35:38.452
I've been trying to fix...

35:39.662 --> 35:42.748
No. I have been telling myself

35:42.748 --> 35:44.458
that I've been trying
to fix things

35:44.458 --> 35:49.171
and make the problems go away,
but the truth is...

35:50.298 --> 35:52.675
I've just been doing stuff
that makes it worse.

35:52.675 --> 35:56.846
I almost killed
two just random people.

35:56.846 --> 35:59.765
I told my daughter everything,
and now she's

35:59.765 --> 36:01.475
some kind of fucking accomplice?

36:01.475 --> 36:03.185
And I...

36:03.185 --> 36:06.897
I-I think I might've said
too much to the police.

36:06.897 --> 36:07.940
I knew it.

36:07.940 --> 36:10.693
I lied to you all because...

36:10.693 --> 36:14.697
I knew that if
the tables were turned,

36:14.697 --> 36:18.242
like, if-if one of
your spouses or whatever

36:18.242 --> 36:21.787
turned out to be
the blackmailer, that...

36:23.164 --> 36:26.375
I probably would've
fucking killed them.

36:29.337 --> 36:31.714
Thanks for your honesty, Shauna.

36:33.549 --> 36:38.179
You're not wrong.
We're all pretty messed up.

36:38.179 --> 36:42.850
It's time we finally
fucking talk about it.

36:42.850 --> 36:45.603
We're not gonna solve shit
with talking, Nat.

36:45.603 --> 36:49.899
This isn't something
that therapies can fix.

36:51.192 --> 36:54.028
Something guided you all here.

36:54.695 --> 36:58.032
And it wasn't guilt, and it
wasn't some psychological need.

36:58.032 --> 37:00.284
It was something greater,

37:00.284 --> 37:03.621
and it has been guiding me,
as well.

37:03.621 --> 37:05.748
First, I tried to ignore it.

37:05.748 --> 37:09.752
I tried to bargain with it.
I tried to will it away, but...

37:11.045 --> 37:13.005
...it's too powerful.

37:15.299 --> 37:18.552
And now we have to
give it what it wants.

42:40.999 --> 42:44.211
No? Do you feel
like there is something

42:44.211 --> 42:47.381
inside of you,
a feeling that you know

42:47.381 --> 42:50.551
is making you do that?

42:50.551 --> 42:53.554
It's no secret we're all
a little fucked up, but

42:53.554 --> 42:57.057
Natalie's right, look at
what we lived through.

42:57.057 --> 42:58.642
But you have to consider

42:58.642 --> 43:00.728
that it's been with us all along

43:00.728 --> 43:02.187
and we've been denying it,

43:02.187 --> 43:04.898
and that is why we're
all so fucked up.

43:04.898 --> 43:06.567

43:06.567 --> 43:08.402
the only way to get
ourselves out of this

fully to it.

are you suggesting?

Tai, you have pushed
your entire family away.

43:56.617 --> 43:58.660
You killed your dog,

43:58.660 --> 44:01.121
and you almost killed your wife.

44:01.121 --> 44:06.627
Shauna, at this rate, you will
lose your family, or worse.

44:06.627 --> 44:10.464
Misty, you did
actually kill someone.

44:10.464 --> 44:12.591
And it made sense.
It was practical.

44:12.591 --> 44:14.218

the good of the group.

44:14.218 --> 44:16.386

Van, you used to be
so full of life,

44:24.436 --> 44:28.565
and now it's like something
has broken within you.

44:28.565 --> 44:32.486
Why don't you just
volunteer to drink it, Lottie?

44:32.486 --> 44:34.446
You know that's
not how this works.

44:34.446 --> 44:36.406
We don't get to decide.

44:36.406 --> 44:38.951
It chooses.

44:38.951 --> 44:41.495
And we'll know
which one of us it is

44:41.495 --> 44:43.872
after we pick up a cup

44:43.872 --> 44:45.499
and we drink it.

44:45.499 --> 44:49.628
It's convenient that you
know which cup is poisoned.

44:49.628 --> 44:51.463
Feel free to shuffle
them around.

44:51.463 --> 44:53.882
And if it makes you feel better,

44:53.882 --> 44:55.342
I will choose last.

44:55.342 --> 45:00.597
This is how we have
always given back.

45:00.597 --> 45:02.391
It helped us survive then,

45:02.391 --> 45:06.895
it will help us survive now
