00:02.066 --> 00:02.500
This program is rated G

00:04.233 --> 00:07.300
and is suitable for
general audiences.

00:31.934 --> 00:35.600
-Come on, Taylor,
we're almost done packing.

01:10.967 --> 01:12.333
-Taylor?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.367
It's time to go.

01:13.433 --> 01:17.000
-Mom, what if Santa
doesn't find us this time?

01:17.066 --> 01:19.734
-Remember what I told you
before our last move?

01:19.800 --> 01:21.433
Wherever you hang your stocking

01:21.500 --> 01:22.867
is where Santa will find you.

01:22.934 --> 01:24.467
And he did, didn't he?

01:25.900 --> 01:28.066
Let's see today's creation.

01:29.567 --> 01:32.066
-Sweetheart,
I think it's your best yet.

01:33.467 --> 01:35.033
-Hey, gang--
The airport limo's here.

01:36.333 --> 01:37.567
-So...

01:37.633 --> 01:38.934
Ready for our next adventure?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.700
-You bet!

01:58.667 --> 02:00.500
-Hi.

02:00.567 --> 02:01.333
-Hey, stranger!

02:01.400 --> 02:02.333
Merry Christmas.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.066
How was Tucson?

02:04.133 --> 02:05.400
Or was it Seattle?

02:05.467 --> 02:06.300
I'm sorry, Taylor,

02:06.367 --> 02:08.166
I can't keep
all your travels straight.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.166
-It was L.A. this time...

02:10.233 --> 02:12.300
I think.

02:12.367 --> 02:13.767
-So you in town for Christmas?

02:13.834 --> 02:14.700
You've got to come by.

02:14.767 --> 02:18.567
-I'm not sure yet,
but I should know soon.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.066
Thanks, Wendy.
Merry Christmas!

02:20.133 --> 02:21.734
-Merry Christmas.

02:57.033 --> 02:57.934
-Hi, Mom!

02:58.000 --> 02:59.467
-Taylor, sweetheart,

02:59.533 --> 03:00.700
I hope it's not too late,

03:00.767 --> 03:02.900
but I wanted to catch you
before we went to breakfast.

03:02.967 --> 03:04.433
-Oh, don't worry,
I just got home.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.166
-Hi, honey.
Merry Christmas!

03:07.233 --> 03:08.333
-Hi, Dad!

03:08.400 --> 03:10.033
Merry Christmas to you.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.200
So how's
Christmas in Singapore?

03:12.266 --> 03:13.700
-Hot and humid.

03:13.767 --> 03:15.367
Now that you've seen
my Christmas sweater,

03:15.433 --> 03:16.433
I'm taking it off.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.834
-So how did things go in L.A.?

03:20.900 --> 03:23.066
-Two sunny months,

03:23.133 --> 03:25.633
and the new condo complex
is almost built...

03:26.867 --> 03:30.300
-And I see you got
the advent calendar I sent.

03:30.367 --> 03:31.533
But is that
tomorrow's chocolate

03:31.600 --> 03:32.467
you're eating today?

03:32.533 --> 03:34.734
Isn't it only December 9th
for you there?

03:34.800 --> 03:37.900
-Hey, it's tomorrow
in Singapore, right?

03:37.967 --> 03:38.967
This one's for you.

03:39.033 --> 03:41.700
-Any chance you can join us
here this Christmas?

03:41.767 --> 03:42.667
-Well, I'd love to,

03:42.734 --> 03:45.233
but I may be packing
the moving boxes again.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.667
I'm meeting my boss tomorrow

03:46.734 --> 03:48.166
to talk about
my next assignment.

03:48.233 --> 03:49.100
-Well, honey,

03:49.166 --> 03:50.567
if you're not coming here
for Christmas,

03:50.633 --> 03:51.433
what will you do?

03:51.500 --> 03:53.734
-Well, Wendy,
she's inviting me over.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.333
I can hang my stocking there.
Okay?

03:55.400 --> 03:57.567
Give Dad a big hug for me.

03:57.633 --> 03:59.400
-I will. Love you.

03:59.467 --> 04:00.567
-Love you, too.

04:00.633 --> 04:01.934
And I'll let you know
what my boss says tomorrow.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.600
-Taylor!
-Hey, Josephine!

04:21.667 --> 04:22.633
Nice to see you!

04:22.700 --> 04:23.633
-Welcome back.

04:23.700 --> 04:24.867
I'd say welcome home,

04:24.934 --> 04:25.734
but you spend more time away
than here.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.567
-Well, I might be
on the road again.

04:27.633 --> 04:29.133
I'm supposed to talk
to Linda right now.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
How do I look?

04:36.266 --> 04:37.200
-Very Merry.

04:37.266 --> 04:38.266
Good luck.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.333
-Thanks.

04:51.667 --> 04:54.033
Yeah, we're excited, too,

04:54.100 --> 04:56.066
and we promise
not to disappoint.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.934
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.333
Goodbye.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.934
-Wow, the Mayor?

05:02.934 --> 05:03.667
What was that about?

05:03.734 --> 05:07.133
-Actually,
it was partly about you.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.700
-Me?

05:08.767 --> 05:10.333
-Taylor,
you've got a great eye...

05:10.400 --> 05:12.800
your work
is always cutting-edge,

05:12.867 --> 05:14.266
and your projects
always come in

05:14.333 --> 05:16.133
on time and under-budget...

05:17.166 --> 05:18.100
-Thank you--

05:18.166 --> 05:21.467
-And that's why the board
is considering you

05:21.533 --> 05:22.967
to head up our new Paris office.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.133
-Wow, that would be terrific.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.000
-We'll see what happens.

05:27.066 --> 05:28.367
But in the meantime,

05:28.433 --> 05:30.467
there's this project
I need your help on.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.533
-I'm totally open
and excited.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.567
What's the project?

05:33.633 --> 05:35.800
-Okay, so you know
that we submitted a proposal

05:35.867 --> 05:38.100
for the new downtown
re-development project...

05:38.166 --> 05:41.967
-Yes, but I thought Crestford
had a lock on City Hall.

05:42.033 --> 05:44.200
-According to the Mayor,

05:44.266 --> 05:45.834
we're currently
his top choice.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.433
-Great!

05:47.500 --> 05:48.300
-In the meantime,

05:48.367 --> 05:49.934
we need to do
everything that we can

05:50.000 --> 05:51.033
to up our public profile.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.166
-How can I help?

05:53.233 --> 05:55.133
-Well, the city's
Christmas Festival is coming up,

05:55.200 --> 05:57.033
and they're doing
a gingerbread house competition

05:57.100 --> 05:58.600
to raise money for charity
this year.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.533
We've got a spot
in the contest...

06:01.600 --> 06:03.367
and I need you

06:03.433 --> 06:05.867
to represent our firm
as our designer!

06:06.967 --> 06:08.767
-You want me...

06:08.834 --> 06:10.900
to design a gingerbread house?

06:10.967 --> 06:14.400
As in gumdrops and candycanes?

06:15.467 --> 06:16.934
-A life-sized one,

06:17.000 --> 06:18.266
and we're talking big.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.600
-Linda, I'm an architect,

06:20.667 --> 06:21.700
not a baker.

06:21.767 --> 06:25.233
-And that's why I've already
found you expert help.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.900
Have you ever heard
of Annabelle Renard?

06:27.967 --> 06:29.333
-Uh... yes.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.567
Doesn't she have
a fancy restaurant downtown?

06:31.633 --> 06:34.667
-She happens to be
best pastry chef in the city.

06:34.734 --> 06:37.367
-She's agreed to meet with you
to discuss teaming up.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.500
Taylor, this is important.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.934
What do you say?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.333
-You had me at gumdrops.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.767
I'm in.

06:46.834 --> 06:47.767
You're kidding me?

06:47.834 --> 06:49.367
A gingerbread house?

06:49.433 --> 06:50.500
-I know.

06:50.567 --> 06:51.500
I thought I was getting Europe,

06:51.567 --> 06:53.567
but it turns out
I'm getting the North Pole...

06:54.633 --> 06:56.333
But Linda wants me to do it,

06:56.400 --> 06:58.900
and it might convince the board
to give me the Paris job.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.300
-Hang on, where are you going?

07:02.367 --> 07:04.333
The office Christmas party
starts in an hour.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.066
-Oh, well, I am meeting a baker
they've paired me up with.

07:08.133 --> 07:09.734
The competition starts
the day after tomorrow,

07:09.800 --> 07:11.734
which means I should
have started yesterday!

07:17.166 --> 07:18.800
-Okay.
Sounds like a plan.

07:18.867 --> 07:21.233
I'll talk to you soon.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.233
-Taylor Scott!

07:22.300 --> 07:23.767
-Bradford?

07:23.834 --> 07:24.700
What brings you here?

07:24.767 --> 07:26.600
-Crestford just moved
our offices here.

07:26.667 --> 07:27.600
We've got
the top two floors now.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.233
-Oh.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.100
-So, I hear that you and I

07:30.166 --> 07:31.600
are going to be going
head to head--

07:31.667 --> 07:34.066
or should I say
gingerbread to gingerbread?

07:35.467 --> 07:37.266
-So you're doing
the competition, too?

07:37.333 --> 07:38.500
-Yeah. What is it
about Crestford and Ogilvy?

07:38.567 --> 07:39.500
They're always so competitive.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.066
-I don't know.

07:41.133 --> 07:43.600
Try asking
your Crestford colleagues...

07:43.667 --> 07:45.166
since they stole you away.

07:45.233 --> 07:47.834
-Well, in one sense,
you've already won this one.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.567
Snagging Annabelle Renard,
I hear, as your partner?

07:50.633 --> 07:52.000
That was a lucky grab,
beat me to it.

07:52.066 --> 07:53.800
-Thanks.

07:53.867 --> 07:56.100
Well, I'm actually late
meeting her now,

07:56.166 --> 07:57.100
so I'll see you around.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.266
-See you on the battlefield.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.700
-Please, the marzipan first,
then the piping.

08:14.767 --> 08:15.800
Get me the meringue
in the kitchen.

08:19.367 --> 08:20.333
-Excuse me, Annabelle?

08:21.767 --> 08:23.166
Taylor Scott.

08:23.233 --> 08:25.033
-Nice to meet you.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.867
-Wow, that looks amazing.

08:26.934 --> 08:28.567
-This? No.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.667
This is a disaster,
but I'll fix it.

08:30.734 --> 08:33.600
So tell me about
this gingerbread competition.

08:34.633 --> 08:37.000
-Oh, I would be honored
to work on it with you.

08:37.066 --> 08:39.533
-Yes, well,
I do owe Linda a favor.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.500
But how much experience
do you have in the kitchen?

08:43.867 --> 08:45.633
-Um... actually, none.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.333
In fact, I'm pretty hopeless.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.133
-Ah?

08:51.200 --> 08:53.667
-But I have designed
condos in Hong Kong,

08:53.734 --> 08:54.667
office parks in Seattle.

08:54.734 --> 08:58.133
I've led teams
of draftspeople and engineers.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.567
So don't worry,
I know how to take charge.

09:00.633 --> 09:02.400
Every ship needs a captain

09:02.467 --> 09:03.600
and I am ready to lead!

09:04.633 --> 09:06.266
-So you would be in charge, huh?

09:07.367 --> 09:08.367
-Oh, absolutely!

09:10.033 --> 09:11.300
-Well, I see.

09:11.367 --> 09:12.934
Very impressive.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.734
I just need to get in touch
with Linda first.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.900
-Okay! Merci.

09:17.967 --> 09:18.967
Merci à vous.

09:19.033 --> 09:20.033
-Okay.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.433
-Adam, let's hurry.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.066
We have three more orders
to drop off.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.900
-You can't rush art, Ray.

09:29.967 --> 09:31.266
-Just move it along, Rembrandt.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.033
-So it went okay with Annabelle?

09:35.100 --> 09:37.800
I've seen her on TV before
and she seems pretty tough.

09:37.867 --> 09:41.133
-I mean, obviously,
she's a perfectionist, too.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.200
We're a great match.

09:42.266 --> 09:43.600
-Annabelle Renard...

09:43.667 --> 09:44.934
wow.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.367
-Yes, sweetheart.

09:48.433 --> 09:50.934
Just a few more deliveries
and Daddy will be home.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.633
-You know, I think building
a gingerbread house

09:53.700 --> 09:54.967
actually might be fun.

09:55.033 --> 09:55.767
-Ooh, I love it.

09:55.834 --> 09:57.567
Not your typical
gingerbread house.

09:57.633 --> 09:58.567
-Thanks.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.133
-Ogilvy Associates?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.133
-Ooh, yes.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.300
This must be the cake
for our Christmas party!

10:02.367 --> 10:03.300
It's beautiful...

10:03.367 --> 10:04.367
-Thanks.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.867
-You just smudged green icing
all over my plans.

10:11.767 --> 10:13.734
-Sorry. Can't you just
re-print your plans?

10:15.834 --> 10:17.600
-Can you just
re-print your cake?

10:17.667 --> 10:19.100
-Sadly not.

10:19.166 --> 10:20.033
Excuse me.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.567
I have your Santa cupcakes
in the van...

10:24.166 --> 10:26.066
-Unbelievable.
-Unbelievable.

10:36.767 --> 10:38.867
-Alright, folks, here they are!

10:38.934 --> 10:40.233
We have to put
the hooks on them

10:40.300 --> 10:42.233
before we can put them
on the tree. Okay?

10:42.300 --> 10:44.133
-But they are good to eat.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.400
-Hey!

10:45.467 --> 10:46.934
Every year,
we have this argument,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.300
the gingerbread
are for decorating, not eating!

10:49.367 --> 10:51.633
-You can't blame us
for liking them,

10:51.700 --> 10:52.834
they're too yummy.

10:54.066 --> 10:56.066
Just more proof your talents
are going to waste at Ray's.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.567
-Not all that again.

10:57.633 --> 10:58.567
-All what, Daddy?

10:58.633 --> 11:00.500
Your baking is always the best.

11:02.367 --> 11:03.767
Be right back!

11:04.767 --> 11:06.200
-The kid's right, Adam--

11:06.266 --> 11:08.133
you're an artist in the kitchen,

11:08.200 --> 11:09.667
but at Ray's,
you paint by numbers.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.700
It's high time
you opened your own bakery.

11:12.767 --> 11:15.467
-Thanks, but that's Ray,

11:15.533 --> 11:16.934
and I've got a few thousand
cookies to bake.

11:26.734 --> 11:29.600
-This project may not have been
my first choice,

11:29.667 --> 11:31.767
but I intend to make
the best out of it.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.233
-Oh, that's Linda right now.

11:36.233 --> 11:37.667
Hi, Linda.

11:37.734 --> 11:39.300
Yeah. I'm out doing
some Christmas shopping.

11:39.367 --> 11:40.166
What's up?

11:40.233 --> 11:42.800
-My blood pressure
if you must know.

11:42.867 --> 11:44.467
-Why? What's wrong?

11:44.533 --> 11:46.200
-Oh, nothing much.

11:46.266 --> 11:48.633
Just that Crestford
poached our talent again.

11:48.700 --> 11:49.700
They got Annabelle.

11:49.767 --> 11:50.967
-What?

11:51.033 --> 11:52.767
How?

11:52.834 --> 11:54.266
She seemed so excited.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.800
-Well, apparently,

11:55.867 --> 11:57.000
she was even more excited

11:57.066 --> 12:00.100
when Crestford offered her
top billing in the competition

12:00.166 --> 12:02.233
and to use her house
in an ad campaign.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.500
-But she can't!

12:04.567 --> 12:08.066
Well, I suppose she can,
but where does that leave us?

12:08.133 --> 12:09.200
-Chef-less.

12:09.266 --> 12:10.200
Any ideas?

12:10.266 --> 12:11.734
-No...

12:11.800 --> 12:13.500
but you know what,
don't worry.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.800
I'll figure out something.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.033
-Taylor, what happened?

12:18.100 --> 12:19.500
-Annabelle dropped me.

12:19.567 --> 12:22.867
The competition starts
in 24 hours,

12:22.934 --> 12:24.633
I need to find
another baker, fast!

12:26.967 --> 12:28.266
Look, I totally understand

12:28.333 --> 12:30.367
it's a busy time of the year
for bakers,

12:30.433 --> 12:32.100
but it's for a good cause...

12:32.166 --> 12:34.667
and a giant gingerbread house.

12:34.734 --> 12:36.467
I mean, come on,
doesn't that sound like fun?

12:38.266 --> 12:39.667
Of course.

12:39.734 --> 12:41.000
I'm sorry to bother you.

12:41.066 --> 12:42.200
Merry Christmas!

12:51.567 --> 12:52.367
-Hello?

12:52.433 --> 12:53.834
Le Gateau?

12:53.900 --> 12:55.000
Hi, yes.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.734
This is Taylor Scott again.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.266
I was wondering
if you'd reconsidered--

13:01.333 --> 13:02.266
Hello--

13:02.333 --> 13:03.633
Hello?

13:05.066 --> 13:06.266
Hello?

13:06.333 --> 13:07.300
-Any leads?

13:12.734 --> 13:13.600
-Come on, Santa,

13:13.667 --> 13:17.333
can't you grant me
an early wish this year?

13:17.400 --> 13:18.700
-Any luck?

13:20.667 --> 13:21.667
-Not yet,

13:21.734 --> 13:24.300
and I've already called
half the bakeries in town.

13:24.367 --> 13:26.467
They're either not interested
or they've already teamed up.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.767
-So what will you do?

13:32.734 --> 13:34.166
-Josephine...

13:34.233 --> 13:36.500
what bakery did you use
for the Christmas party?

13:36.567 --> 13:38.166
-Ray's Bakery. Why?

13:38.233 --> 13:39.667
-'Cause desperate times

13:39.734 --> 13:42.233
call for desperate
measuring cups.

13:43.367 --> 13:44.467
-Did you just make
a baking joke?

13:58.333 --> 13:59.300
-Be out in a minute.

14:07.867 --> 14:09.700
-Yes. How can I help you?

14:12.467 --> 14:13.400
-Uh-oh... it's you.

14:13.467 --> 14:14.467
Brooke?

14:15.967 --> 14:17.633
Hide the cakes!

14:17.700 --> 14:18.700
-Look--

14:18.767 --> 14:20.333
I know we got off
on the wrong foot the other day.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.867
-That's putting it mildly.

14:23.033 --> 14:26.333
-Daddy, you told me
to always be nice to customers.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.633
Hi, I'm Brooke.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.533
Welcome to Ray's.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.533
-Nice to meet you, Brooke.
I'm Taylor.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.000
-How can I help you?

14:32.066 --> 14:33.567
-Are you Ray?

14:33.633 --> 14:34.834
-I'm Adam.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.066
I work for Ray.
He's not here.

14:36.133 --> 14:39.533
-But you did make that amazing
Christmas tree cake, right?

14:39.600 --> 14:40.734
-Yeah, that's all me.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.800
-And, obviously, you have
a lot of experience with baking.

14:44.867 --> 14:47.400
Cookies, icing, decorating?

14:47.467 --> 14:49.900
-My Dad can make anything.

14:49.967 --> 14:52.066
-Ever make a gingerbread house?

14:52.133 --> 14:54.800
-Dad made a whole
gingerbread village one year!

14:56.233 --> 14:58.967
-And what about
a giant gingerbread house?

14:59.033 --> 15:00.467
Big enough to stand in.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.600
Could you make one of those?

15:01.667 --> 15:04.433
-I'm not sure I understand.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.900
-Look, I'm an architect,

15:05.967 --> 15:07.567
and I am representing my firm

15:07.633 --> 15:10.200
in the city's giant
gingerbread house competition.

15:10.266 --> 15:13.633
Seeing that it needs to be
80% edible,

15:13.700 --> 15:15.767
I need a baker to team up with,

15:15.834 --> 15:18.100
and I'm thinking
that should be you.

15:19.133 --> 15:19.900
-I'm flattered,

15:19.967 --> 15:22.300
but I don't have
a lot of spare time.

15:22.367 --> 15:23.900
-But, Dad, it sounds so fun!

15:25.100 --> 15:27.233
-Don't you have homework to do?

15:27.300 --> 15:29.367
That table right there
has got your name on it.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.233
Keep your paws off
the Christmas cupcakes.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.266
I've got eyes
in the back of my head.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.700
-Look, you have a gift.

15:35.767 --> 15:37.633
That cake was amazing

15:37.700 --> 15:40.333
and, obviously,
you are a great pastry chef.

15:41.533 --> 15:42.867
-I'm just a baker.

15:42.934 --> 15:44.600
-Just a baker could not make

15:44.667 --> 15:46.467
that amazing
Christmas tree cake.

15:46.533 --> 15:47.934
-They're just a passion project

15:48.000 --> 15:49.600
my boss lets me do
now and then.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.433
It doesn't really fit
our clientele.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.467
I'm here to crank out
the donuts and the muffins,

15:53.533 --> 15:54.934
and speaking of which...

15:55.000 --> 15:56.900
I'll be with you folks
in just a second.

15:56.967 --> 15:58.033
-But you have to do it!

15:58.100 --> 15:59.567
There'll be prestige,

15:59.633 --> 16:00.633
Christmas spirit,

16:00.700 --> 16:02.934
something for your free time!

16:03.934 --> 16:05.934
-"Free time,"
that's something I don't have.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.200
-But I'll be in
a terrible situation

16:07.266 --> 16:08.200
if you say no!

16:08.266 --> 16:10.700
-Are you trying to guilt me?

16:10.767 --> 16:12.100
-I don't know.
Is it working?

16:12.166 --> 16:14.367
-To guilt someone,
you have to know them,

16:14.433 --> 16:15.834
and, well, we don't--

16:15.900 --> 16:18.000
-Fine, I'm a Sagittarius
and I love Peppermint Bark.

16:18.066 --> 16:18.800
-Still no.

16:18.867 --> 16:20.834
Mrs. Masy,
cherry danish as usual?

16:22.934 --> 16:24.633
-But it would be great exposure.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.367
I mean,
everyone around the world

16:26.433 --> 16:27.367
would see your talents!

16:27.433 --> 16:29.266
-I have a line.

16:36.834 --> 16:37.800
-Excuse me.

16:39.033 --> 16:40.533
-Here.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.600
In case you change your mind.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.467
-Nice to meet you, Brooke.

16:47.533 --> 16:48.467
Merry Christmas!

16:48.533 --> 16:49.734
-Merry Christmas.

16:53.567 --> 16:56.934
-You've been twirling
that card around all evening,

16:57.000 --> 16:58.767
and Brooke can't stop talking

16:58.834 --> 17:00.200
about the gingerbread
competition.

17:00.266 --> 17:01.533
-I can't.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.033
I've got a job,
I've got responsibilities and...

17:04.100 --> 17:06.266
-Ray's sons are in town
to help him,

17:06.333 --> 17:10.066
and you do have weeks
of unused vacation.

17:10.133 --> 17:11.100
-But I don't know...

17:11.166 --> 17:13.100
-Adam, don't you want Brooke

17:13.166 --> 17:15.166
to see you do something
that makes you happy?

17:31.233 --> 17:32.166
-This is Taylor.

17:32.233 --> 17:34.400
-Hey. It's Adam.

17:34.467 --> 17:35.767
The Christmas tree cake guy?

17:35.834 --> 17:37.934
-Oh, that Adam.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.500
How could I forget?

17:39.567 --> 17:41.166
-I'm calling about your offer.

17:41.233 --> 17:44.166
Look, I'm...

17:45.300 --> 17:46.700
-Hello? Are you still there?

17:46.767 --> 17:49.233
-As difficult as it was
for you to ask...

17:49.300 --> 17:52.533
it's just as difficult
for me to--

17:52.600 --> 17:54.166
-Accept my offer?

17:55.166 --> 17:56.233
-Yes. That.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.100
-So you'll do it?

17:58.166 --> 17:59.934
-Yes.

18:00.066 --> 18:00.967
-Great!

18:01.033 --> 18:03.633
Well, in that case,
we'll start tomorrow.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.100
-Sounds good.

18:38.467 --> 18:41.233
-Oh, they've got pies.
Want to go look?

18:41.300 --> 18:43.266
Come on,
let's go look at the pies.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.767
-Ooh, those pies smell good.

18:44.834 --> 18:46.200
-Merry Christmas.

18:48.433 --> 18:49.367
-Look.

18:49.433 --> 18:50.900
Ice sculptures!

18:53.333 --> 18:54.900
Oh, look, there's Taylor.

18:56.834 --> 18:57.767
Hey.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.433
-Hi.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.667
-You got that sign up quick.

19:01.734 --> 19:03.166
-Our design team's
pretty on the ball.

19:03.233 --> 19:06.433
-Daddy, why isn't
your name on it?

19:06.500 --> 19:07.300
-It's fine, honey.

19:07.367 --> 19:09.734
-But, Dad,
you need the bubble-icity.

19:09.800 --> 19:10.767
-"Bubble-icity"?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.333
Oh! Publicity!

19:14.400 --> 19:16.633
-Right. Publicity!

19:16.700 --> 19:18.567
To help when he opens
his own bakery!

19:18.633 --> 19:20.133
-Seriously?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.467
-My daughter has
a big imagination,

19:22.533 --> 19:23.767
but I already have a job.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.266
-Ladies and gentleman,
boys and girls.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.867
May I have
your attention, please?

19:29.300 --> 19:30.767
-As your Mayor,

19:30.834 --> 19:32.400
I am thrilled to welcome you

19:32.467 --> 19:34.567
to our Christmas Festival

19:34.633 --> 19:37.700
and our first-ever
Giant Gingerbread competition.

19:45.667 --> 19:46.600
This year, we have...

19:46.667 --> 19:47.633
-Friends of yours?

19:47.700 --> 19:50.266
-More like a former colleague.

19:50.333 --> 19:51.800
Bradford used to work
at the firm.

19:51.867 --> 19:55.100
You can say we have
a friendly rivalry going on.

19:55.166 --> 19:57.100
And Annabelle Renard...

19:57.166 --> 19:58.900
She's the best pastry chef
in the state.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.600
-Okay, truth is,

20:03.667 --> 20:05.967
she and I were talking about
working together on this.

20:06.033 --> 20:06.800
-Looks like your colleague
over there

20:06.867 --> 20:09.066
made a more convincing
sales pitch.

20:10.066 --> 20:13.467
-Now, each team has 10 days
to build their masterpiece,

20:13.533 --> 20:15.633
for final judging
on December 23rd...

20:16.967 --> 20:19.233
So, without further ado...

20:19.300 --> 20:23.967
let the Giant Gingerbread
Competition begin!

20:30.166 --> 20:32.667
-Looks like we've got
our work cut out for us.

20:32.734 --> 20:33.767
-That you do.

20:33.834 --> 20:37.233
-Linda, this is Adam, our baker.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.400
-Nice to meet you.

20:38.467 --> 20:40.166
-Likewise.

20:40.233 --> 20:41.300
We're counting on you.

20:41.367 --> 20:45.266
So think cutting-edge,
and be bold with your designs.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.700
And we can win this.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.000
-But no pressure, right?

20:49.066 --> 20:50.400
-Tell me about it...

20:50.467 --> 20:52.700
Okay. Let's get started.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.867
-Come on.

20:54.934 --> 20:57.300
Brooke, let's go find
Aunt Jenny first.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.500
-What is that?

21:16.567 --> 21:18.567
-Plans for
our gingerbread house.

21:18.633 --> 21:19.567
What?

21:19.633 --> 21:22.300
-I assumed the design

21:22.367 --> 21:24.500
is something
we'd come up with together.

21:24.567 --> 21:27.400
-Well, I am
a professional architect.

21:27.467 --> 21:29.033
I think I know what I'm doing.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.800
-Really?

21:30.867 --> 21:32.934
Because that house doesn't look
very Christmassy?

21:33.934 --> 21:34.734
-Not Christmassy?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.200
Well, what is
that supposed to mean?

21:36.266 --> 21:38.700
-Well, it's so modern.

21:39.967 --> 21:40.700
It looks like

21:40.767 --> 21:42.433
a 21st-century
gingerbread condo!

21:43.800 --> 21:45.333
-Well, you heard my boss--

21:45.400 --> 21:49.033
it needs to be sophisticated,
cutting-edge.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.900
-Christmas isn't about
cutting-edge,

21:50.967 --> 21:53.667
Christmas is about warmth
and tradition--

21:53.734 --> 21:56.567
-And thank you for your input,

21:56.633 --> 21:58.700
but I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.

21:59.867 --> 22:02.066
In a construction project,

22:02.133 --> 22:04.734
an architect oversees
all creative choices.

22:05.834 --> 22:07.600
-And in a baking project,

22:07.667 --> 22:09.533
typically, the head chef
is in charge--

22:09.600 --> 22:10.900
-Of building materials.

22:12.266 --> 22:13.734
-Look, all day long,

22:13.800 --> 22:15.133
I'm stuck making
blueberry muffins, okay?

22:15.200 --> 22:17.767
My fingers are stained blue!

22:17.834 --> 22:18.700
This is my chance to get out

22:18.767 --> 22:20.867
and do something artistic
for the week.

22:20.934 --> 22:23.967
-Okay, how about you
stay out of design decisions,

22:24.033 --> 22:25.033
and help with
building materials?

22:25.100 --> 22:28.200
-I need to be involved
with the design decisions,

22:28.266 --> 22:29.367
so I can advise

22:29.433 --> 22:32.200
on which gingerbread to use
for the building material!

22:32.266 --> 22:34.500
-How about we agree to disagree?

22:35.533 --> 22:37.266
But at least get started
in the meantime?

22:38.300 --> 22:39.567
-Are you always this stubborn?

22:39.633 --> 22:41.567
-I was going to say
the same of you!

22:41.633 --> 22:42.900
-Fine.

22:42.967 --> 22:44.133
Well, we'd better head back.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.633
We've got to start baking.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.266
First step is coming up
with a gingerbread

22:47.333 --> 22:48.266
dense enough not to crumble,

22:48.333 --> 22:50.900
and that's gonna take
some experimentation...

22:50.967 --> 22:51.900
-Great idea.

22:51.967 --> 22:52.900
-Let's go.

22:52.967 --> 22:53.967
-"Let's"?

22:54.033 --> 22:56.166
-Didn't you just agree
to be my baking assistant?

23:08.533 --> 23:11.333
-Wow, that's a huge,
colossal Christmas tree....

23:11.400 --> 23:14.266
-Actually, we got the small one
this year.

23:14.333 --> 23:16.633
-What kind of Christmas Tree
do you have, Taylor?

23:16.700 --> 23:19.433
-Actually,
I don't usually have one.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.166
You see, I travel a lot,

23:21.233 --> 23:23.367
and they don't fit too well
in a carry-on luggage.

23:23.433 --> 23:25.967
-But everyone should have
a Christmas Tree!

23:29.734 --> 23:31.500
-Brooke, did you make that?

23:32.700 --> 23:34.066
That's beautiful!

23:37.066 --> 23:38.033
-It's a school project.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.433
I'm supposed to be making
a Christmas diorama,

23:41.500 --> 23:44.500
but I'm kinda stuck
on making the trees...

23:45.700 --> 23:47.100
Do you want a little hint?

23:47.166 --> 23:49.000
You can make great tree trunks

23:49.066 --> 23:52.033
by wrapping sandwich twists
in parchment paper.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.166
I made a lot of models

23:53.233 --> 23:54.367
when I was
in architecture school.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.433
-Thanks!

23:55.500 --> 23:56.633
-Oh, sous-chef!

23:56.700 --> 23:57.667
You're needed.

23:58.600 --> 23:59.600
-I think that means me.

23:59.667 --> 24:01.700
-And I have a hint, too!

24:01.767 --> 24:03.333
When you cook with my Dad,

24:03.400 --> 24:06.033
wear an apron
'cause a lot of things splash.

24:07.667 --> 24:08.667
-Wish me luck.

24:12.300 --> 24:15.900
-Okay, I am ready to help.

24:15.967 --> 24:17.033
Thank you.

24:17.100 --> 24:20.033
-Gingerbread batch number one
is in the oven already.

24:20.100 --> 24:21.533
I had a leftover batch of dough.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.533
It just needs two more minutes.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.567
Each batch cooks six minutes.

24:25.633 --> 24:27.300
Your job
is to keep track of time.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.233
-Great, I'm doing the job
of an egg timer.

24:31.433 --> 24:33.000
-Gingerbread batch number two,

24:33.066 --> 24:35.567
I made with margarine,
instead of butter.

24:35.633 --> 24:37.934
And for our third experiment,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.166
I'm substituting corn syrup
for molasses.

24:40.233 --> 24:42.433
This keeps the pasty
from puffing out,

24:42.500 --> 24:43.633
and maintains its shape.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.934
-These are all variations
on my Mom's gingerbread recipe.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.066
Hers used lots of butter...

24:49.300 --> 24:51.934
-Little trick they don't teach
you in culinary school...

24:52.000 --> 24:54.233
butter improves the taste
of everything.

24:54.300 --> 24:55.900
-But no one will taste it.

24:55.967 --> 24:57.533
You should be concerned
with durability.

24:57.600 --> 25:00.467
-I've never compromised on taste
and I'm not about to start now.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.133
-And you went
to culinary school?

25:02.200 --> 25:03.633
-Long story.

25:03.700 --> 25:04.700
Keep stirring.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.800
-You do know
they have powdered ginger?

25:10.867 --> 25:15.000
-Creativity and inspiration
can't be rushed, okay?

25:15.066 --> 25:15.934
Rome wasn't built in a day--

25:16.000 --> 25:17.800
and our gingerbread house
won't be either.

25:17.867 --> 25:19.433
-Clearly not if you're involved.

25:19.500 --> 25:22.567
Wouldn't working with a recipe
be more efficient?

25:22.633 --> 25:25.734
-I like to take my time,
let my creativity flow.

25:25.800 --> 25:26.934
-Sounds risky.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.633
-Maybe,
but for every fallen soufflé,

25:29.700 --> 25:31.266
there's a perfect
profiterole tower...

25:31.333 --> 25:34.166
-You know, I'm really glad
you're not an architect,

25:34.233 --> 25:36.233
because that approach
would not pass inspection.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.066
-Now, remember,
we don't want bricks.

25:39.133 --> 25:41.934
We need thin rectangles
of gingerbread.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.333
-Why so thin?

25:43.400 --> 25:45.400
-Well, remember my design?

25:45.467 --> 25:47.467
It calls for thin pieces
of gingerbread.

25:47.533 --> 25:51.734
I need for my design
to be ultra sleek and modern.

25:52.867 --> 25:55.100
-But that'll make it
more likely to crack.

25:55.166 --> 25:56.700
-Maybe use less butter?

25:57.700 --> 25:59.266
-And compromise
taste and texture?

26:00.433 --> 26:02.033
What do you say
we stop the backseat baking?

26:02.100 --> 26:03.700
Remember our deal?

26:03.767 --> 26:05.200
In the kitchen, I'm in charge?

26:05.266 --> 26:07.734
-Yeah, but I'm the--

26:07.800 --> 26:09.200
Do you smell smoke?

26:24.567 --> 26:26.567
-Okay, so our first
collaboration

26:26.633 --> 26:27.834
could have gone
slightly better.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.266
-Hey.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.967
-Morning.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.800
-I wasn't expecting to see you
here so early.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.166
-And why not?

26:49.233 --> 26:50.166
Bakers always get up early.

26:50.233 --> 26:53.100
-Well, after yesterday's fiasco,
I wasn't sure--

26:53.166 --> 26:54.333
-I'd show up?

26:54.400 --> 26:56.767
Well, I always finish
what I start.

26:56.834 --> 26:58.834
Besides,
we've got a frame to build.

26:58.900 --> 26:59.767
But first, coffee.

27:08.300 --> 27:09.400
-Thank you.

27:09.467 --> 27:11.667
-So you always make
your own coffee?

27:11.734 --> 27:13.934
-It's the most important tool
we've got.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.100
-And we've got a bunch
of sleepy volunteers

27:16.166 --> 27:17.333
arriving this morning.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.400
-Mm.

27:19.467 --> 27:20.834
Okay, I see your point.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.700
-Now let's finish the base.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.400
and start shopping
for ingredients

27:25.467 --> 27:26.700
if we want to start baking.

27:26.767 --> 27:28.000
-I assume you have
a shopping list?

27:28.934 --> 27:30.400
-Sure, I do.

27:30.467 --> 27:31.500
Right up here.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.333
-No list?

27:33.400 --> 27:34.900
Doesn't that seem
a little off-the-cuff?

27:34.967 --> 27:36.934
-I got a couple things
written down,

27:37.000 --> 27:38.667
but you've got to leave room
for inspiration.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.066
-Inspiration sounds expensive.

27:41.133 --> 27:43.834
I think I'll tag along, too.

27:55.934 --> 27:58.266
-Imported honey?

27:58.333 --> 27:59.433
When did you get that?

27:59.500 --> 28:02.734
-I'm known for not skimping
when it comes to quality.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.066
-Well, I'm known
for coming in under budget.

28:06.367 --> 28:07.367
So, did you pick up

28:07.433 --> 28:10.133
all your fancy baking skills
at culinary school?

28:10.200 --> 28:11.066
-A few.

28:11.133 --> 28:14.033
But I wasn't there long,
maybe six months.

28:15.567 --> 28:16.433
I had to drop out.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.734
I was too busy
raising Brooke on my own.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.867
We lost Brooke's mother
a few years ago.

28:24.734 --> 28:26.266
-Oh, I'm sorry.
That must have been pretty hard.

28:26.333 --> 28:29.467
-It's been a challenge,
raising my baby on my own,

28:29.533 --> 28:31.400
but baking is something

28:31.467 --> 28:33.033
that always seems to put
a smile on her face.

28:35.367 --> 28:38.166
-So, where'd you get
your passion for architecture?

28:38.233 --> 28:39.600
-Seeing amazing buildings
all around the world

28:39.667 --> 28:40.467
when I was growing up.

28:40.533 --> 28:43.000
I was born in Philly

28:43.066 --> 28:45.266
and lived mostly here
till I was 6.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.633
My Mom's an international lawyer

28:47.700 --> 28:49.400
and my Dad's a diplomat.

28:49.467 --> 28:50.467
We moved every couple years.

28:50.533 --> 28:52.500
-That's a lot of moving.

28:52.567 --> 28:54.400
-Oh, no, I loved it.

28:54.467 --> 28:57.500
I mean, some kids collect dolls,

28:57.567 --> 28:58.934
I collected passport stamps.

28:59.900 --> 29:02.200
And since I'm single
and love to travel,

29:02.266 --> 29:03.834
the firm, these days,

29:03.900 --> 29:06.767
sees me as the go-to-girl
for far-off projects.

29:08.100 --> 29:09.066
-And where do you go
for Christmas?

29:09.133 --> 29:10.734
-I usually visit my parents,

29:10.800 --> 29:12.467
but this year,
they're in Singapore,

29:12.533 --> 29:17.066
and I have a gingerbread house
to build here.

29:17.133 --> 29:20.000
-So you don't miss hosting
your own traditional Christmas?

29:20.066 --> 29:21.900
-Wherever I hang my stocking,
it's Christmas.

29:21.967 --> 29:24.533
I mean, of course,
I'd love all that.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.567
It's just
life turned out differently.

29:27.633 --> 29:28.667
-See, that I understand,

29:28.734 --> 29:31.600
'cause I was gonna be
a world-famous pastry chef.

29:32.600 --> 29:33.600
-It's never too late.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.033
-Thanks.

29:38.433 --> 29:40.400
-Taylor, I thought that was you.

29:40.467 --> 29:41.867
You know Annabelle, I believe?

29:41.934 --> 29:43.300
-Yes, we've met.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.834
-Annabelle Renard.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.000
-Gold medalist at last year's

29:47.066 --> 29:49.000
European Pastry Panache
Competition.

29:49.066 --> 29:50.967
-Adam Dale...

29:51.033 --> 29:52.300
voted best personality
in high school.

29:52.367 --> 29:53.467
-Oh.

29:53.533 --> 29:55.166
-Wait, you're--
you're the donut guy.

29:55.233 --> 29:56.400
From Ray's--right here!

29:56.467 --> 29:57.867
You make the best jelly donuts.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.867
-Yeah, that's me.

30:00.934 --> 30:02.200
-And that's just his day job.

30:02.266 --> 30:05.066
Adam is a very talented
patissier...

30:05.133 --> 30:06.800
-Oh! How nice!

30:07.800 --> 30:08.800
May the best team win.

30:13.867 --> 30:15.500
-"Talented patissier."

30:15.567 --> 30:17.200
I like the sound of that.

30:17.266 --> 30:19.500
-Don't let it go to your head.

30:19.567 --> 30:20.667
Let's hurry back.

30:20.734 --> 30:22.000
We've got to meet
the volunteers.

30:30.266 --> 30:33.633
-Adam, this is David,
our new intern at the firm.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.200
-Nice to meet you.

30:36.233 --> 30:37.667
You can lose the sportsjacket.

30:37.734 --> 30:39.000
-Yes, sir.

30:39.066 --> 30:40.633
-And this is my friend,
Josephine.

30:40.700 --> 30:41.467
-Hi!

30:41.533 --> 30:42.400
-Hi.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.200
-And this is my neighbor, Wendy.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.567
-Sorry I couldn't
draft my kids, Taylor,

30:46.633 --> 30:47.734
but it's for the best,

30:47.800 --> 30:49.266
'cause they would have just
devoured the gingerbread.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.533
-So, thanks
for volunteering, everyone.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.734
We have a big week
ahead of us,

30:54.800 --> 30:57.967
so first, we put up the frame,

30:58.033 --> 30:58.900
next, we bake,

30:58.967 --> 31:00.433
then we cover the frame
with gingerbread,

31:00.500 --> 31:02.767
and the final phase--

31:02.834 --> 31:04.133
decorating!

31:04.200 --> 31:05.300
We can make this amazing!

31:05.367 --> 31:08.233
If we stay on schedule, that is.

31:09.667 --> 31:10.467
-Was that comment
directed at me?

31:10.533 --> 31:12.467
-Well, I'm simply
reminding everyone

31:12.533 --> 31:14.066
we are on a strict time limit...

31:14.133 --> 31:15.600
-Though we want everybody

31:15.667 --> 31:17.300
to feel free
to follow their creativity...

31:17.367 --> 31:20.467
-As long as we meet
certain benchmarks

31:20.533 --> 31:23.367
and construction timetables...

31:23.433 --> 31:24.300
-While making the most colorful

31:24.367 --> 31:26.133
and delicious
gingerbread house we can.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.200
-Okay, do you remember
what we agreed on?

31:28.266 --> 31:31.066
Staying on our own side
of the street?

31:31.133 --> 31:32.633
-Yes, but--

31:32.700 --> 31:34.533
-You're driving on my sidewalk.

31:38.266 --> 31:39.033
So...

31:39.100 --> 31:40.500
Shall we begin?

32:13.867 --> 32:15.033
-How did you do that?

32:15.100 --> 32:15.900
-Do what?

32:15.967 --> 32:18.300
-Give me what I needed
before I asked?

32:18.367 --> 32:19.367
-In the kitchen,

32:19.433 --> 32:21.133
you get good at predicting
who needs what and when.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.100
And you made a face?

32:25.233 --> 32:26.266
-And, obviously,

32:26.333 --> 32:28.900
you still want our house
to have a traditional roof.

32:29.934 --> 32:31.667
-How do you know that?

32:31.734 --> 32:32.800
-'Cause you made a face.

32:35.100 --> 32:38.667
-So how did you get caught up
in this project anyway?

32:38.734 --> 32:40.700
-My boss asked me to do it.

32:40.767 --> 32:41.967
Last month,

32:42.033 --> 32:44.533
I was crafting
a 10-story condo,

32:44.600 --> 32:47.867
and this week,
I am in charge of gumdrops...

32:47.934 --> 32:50.000
-There's no shame in designing
a gingerbread house.

32:50.066 --> 32:51.567
-Well, I like a challenge.

32:52.567 --> 32:53.567
Besides just working with you.

32:54.567 --> 32:55.467
-Very funny.

32:55.533 --> 32:58.767
And I'm in charge of gumdrops,
by the way.

33:04.734 --> 33:06.567
-Why, thank you.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.367
-I'd say we made
pretty good progress today.

33:10.433 --> 33:11.867
The frame's near done.

33:11.934 --> 33:15.200
-So, is it true
what Brooke said earlier?

33:17.066 --> 33:20.100
Do you want to open
your own bakery?

33:20.166 --> 33:21.900
-Wanted to.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.100
I tried a while back,

33:23.166 --> 33:26.900
but no investors wanted to fund
a culinary school dropout.

33:26.967 --> 33:28.433
-Well if we win,

33:28.500 --> 33:30.867
maybe you should reach out
to them again.

33:30.934 --> 33:32.233
-I'm doing this
for one reason only,

33:32.300 --> 33:35.400
and that's to make Brooke happy.

33:35.467 --> 33:37.033
Do you think that means
I lack ambition?

33:38.767 --> 33:42.000
-No, you're just guilty
of being a great dad.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.166
-Speaking of Brooke,

33:44.233 --> 33:45.500
she wanted me
to give you something.

33:46.934 --> 33:48.367
An invitation
for dinner tonight.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.400
And if those instant noodle cups
you snuck in with the supplies

33:52.467 --> 33:54.533
are what you're calling dinner,

33:54.600 --> 33:56.700
you have no choice
but to accept our invitation.

33:57.734 --> 33:58.867
-Okay. Sure.

34:10.367 --> 34:12.233
-That was delicious.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.734
Thank you both for inviting me.

34:14.734 --> 34:15.667
Sp what's in the pizza anyway?

34:15.734 --> 34:18.400
-Just my special recipe.

34:18.467 --> 34:20.433
-Except you don't use recipes.

34:21.533 --> 34:24.567
-Pecorino cheese,
fennel sausage and truffle oil.

34:24.633 --> 34:26.000
-Hey, Honey!

34:26.066 --> 34:27.967
Those are trade secrets.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.900
I guess Taylor
is now in our circle of trust.

34:32.567 --> 34:34.300
-Well anyway,
that was delicious.

34:34.367 --> 34:36.433
Seriously, the best dinner
I've had in months.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.967
-I'm going to work on
my diorama.

34:38.033 --> 34:38.967
Do you want to help?

34:39.033 --> 34:40.266
-Sure.

34:45.533 --> 34:46.600
Oh...

34:46.667 --> 34:50.333
your Christmas diorama
is looking better and better!

34:50.400 --> 34:53.400
You clearly have your Dad's gift
for decorating.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.300
It just takes so long, though.

34:55.367 --> 34:56.633
I need a herd of reindeer,

34:56.700 --> 34:59.734
and each reindeer
takes forever to draw...

34:59.800 --> 35:02.200
-Well, it doesn't have to.

35:02.266 --> 35:05.300
All you need is a template.

35:05.367 --> 35:08.667
Just think of it
as a Christmas cookie-cutter,

35:08.734 --> 35:09.700
but for art projects.

35:10.633 --> 35:11.667
Here, let me show you...

35:11.734 --> 35:14.200
Let's draw our reindeer...

35:18.200 --> 35:18.934
Now...

35:19.000 --> 35:21.500
all we need to do
is cut it out.

35:24.567 --> 35:25.533
There we go.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.000
And...

35:29.900 --> 35:31.667
we've got...

35:31.734 --> 35:34.734
a master stencil...

35:34.800 --> 35:37.133
to create...

35:37.200 --> 35:39.867
all the reindeer we need.

35:39.934 --> 35:40.900
Voila.

35:40.967 --> 35:42.066
-Wow!

35:42.133 --> 35:43.200
Thanks, Taylor!

35:43.266 --> 35:44.033
-Well, like I said,

35:44.100 --> 35:47.367
you have a great eye
for decorating.

35:47.433 --> 35:51.133
So I propose we make you

35:51.200 --> 35:54.100
"Chief Decorating Officer"
for the Gingerbread house.

35:55.033 --> 35:58.667
That is, if that doesn't
step on anyone's toes?

35:58.734 --> 36:01.700
-I'd be more than happy
to share the glory.

36:01.767 --> 36:02.734
-Yes!

36:11.467 --> 36:12.600
-Thanks for the ride.

36:12.667 --> 36:14.266
-I had to.

36:14.333 --> 36:15.633
You're the only adult
I know in Philly

36:15.700 --> 36:16.700
who doesn't own a car.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.633
-Cute. She's a great kid.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.066
-Well, she certainly seems
to have taken a liking to you.

36:27.700 --> 36:31.033
-So, you even decorate
your truck for Christmas?

36:31.100 --> 36:34.033
-Our house is so decorated,
my truck got a little jealous.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.533
-That's your house?
The one on the end there?

36:40.266 --> 36:41.533
You don't have
any decorations up.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.734
-Who's got the time?

36:44.467 --> 36:45.700
-No Christmas decorations?

36:47.700 --> 36:50.200
You know, if one of
the gingerbread judges saw this,

36:50.266 --> 36:52.200
we'd be disqualified
for lack of Christmas spirit!

36:53.433 --> 36:54.433
No wonder you don't know

36:54.500 --> 36:55.867
what a real gingerbread house
should look like!

36:55.934 --> 36:56.800
-Oh, please...

36:56.867 --> 36:59.367
-It should be colorful,
warm and inviting.

36:59.433 --> 37:01.467
It should be decorated
to the hilt but with love.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.200
It should make you think
of your Grandma's house.

37:04.266 --> 37:07.900
-Well, my grandmother lives
in a high-rise in Tampa.

37:10.033 --> 37:11.433
Good night.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.266
-Hey...

37:13.333 --> 37:15.300
the first item

37:15.367 --> 37:16.900
in your Christmas
decoration kit...

37:19.333 --> 37:20.266
-This?

37:20.333 --> 37:21.900
-What can I say?
It's a start.

37:46.367 --> 37:47.133
-Okay, can you--

37:47.200 --> 37:48.834
-Take the last tray
out of the oven?

37:48.900 --> 37:49.967
I'm on it...

37:54.900 --> 37:55.834
-Hot.

37:55.900 --> 37:56.834
-Can you pass me the--

37:56.900 --> 37:58.567
-Spatula? Here.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.400
We need to wait
until these are nice and dry

38:03.467 --> 38:05.133
so that...

38:05.200 --> 38:06.500
-The frosting adheres.

38:08.533 --> 38:10.200
Hey, did you notice?

38:10.266 --> 38:11.467
-What?

38:11.533 --> 38:13.033
-The smell of nothing burning.

38:13.100 --> 38:14.967
-Amazing, right?

38:15.033 --> 38:16.867
I'd say our second collaboration

38:16.934 --> 38:19.000
is a teeny bit better
than our first.

38:19.066 --> 38:21.133
-That isn't saying much.

38:22.066 --> 38:23.100
-Well, well, well,

38:23.166 --> 38:24.734
it looks like the elves
have taken over my kitchen.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.367
-Tired elves.

38:26.433 --> 38:27.266
Taylor, meet my boss, Ray.

38:27.333 --> 38:28.333
It's nice to meet you, Ray.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.567
Thank you so much
for letting us use your kitchen.

38:30.633 --> 38:31.433
-No problem.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.633
Adam, can I talk to you
for a minute?

38:38.800 --> 38:40.967
-That's quite a project
you two have going.

38:41.033 --> 38:41.967
-Hey, don't worry about it.

38:42.033 --> 38:43.400
I can keep up
with the muffins and the bagels.

38:43.467 --> 38:44.500
-I know...

38:44.567 --> 38:46.734
And I know I've got you
baking below your potential.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.400
-I like working here, okay?
You're a good boss.

38:48.467 --> 38:49.900
-You know,

38:49.967 --> 38:51.633
I'd let you bake
the fancy stuff full-time,

38:51.700 --> 38:54.667
but this is
an old family bakery.

38:54.734 --> 38:57.133
I've had customers here
for the last 20 years--

38:57.200 --> 38:59.500
-And "Our customers
only want the basics."

38:59.567 --> 39:00.800
Yeah, I know.

39:00.867 --> 39:02.367
-You read my mind.

39:02.433 --> 39:04.266
Anyway, this week,
sky's the limit

39:04.333 --> 39:05.734
and my kitchen's
at your command.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.266
You know, I'd offer to help,

39:09.333 --> 39:11.400
but it looks like you two
have the situation in hand.

39:11.467 --> 39:14.100
-Thanks again
for letting us bake here.

39:14.166 --> 39:15.533
-My pleasure.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.767
Good luck.

39:16.834 --> 39:19.800
-Our gingerbread
needs five hours to cool,

39:19.867 --> 39:21.734
so can I suggest a break?

39:21.800 --> 39:23.233
-You busy?
-Why?

39:23.300 --> 39:24.066
-I've got to get

39:24.133 --> 39:25.734
some stocking stuffers
for Brooke,

39:25.800 --> 39:27.233
and since you're
a Philly native,

39:27.300 --> 39:29.200
maybe it's time
you get re-acquainted

39:29.266 --> 39:31.333
with how your home town
celebrates Christmas?

39:32.500 --> 39:33.433
-Okay.

39:33.500 --> 39:34.667
-Let's do it.

39:42.700 --> 39:45.800
-I can't believe
you're not cold.

39:45.867 --> 39:46.633
-It feels good

39:46.700 --> 39:49.433
after being
near the ovens all day.

39:49.500 --> 39:52.100
Is this really your first
Christmas in Philadelphia?

39:52.166 --> 39:53.734
-As an adult, yeah.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.734
-So you have no Christmas
memories here as a kid?

39:56.800 --> 39:58.467
-Well, it feels familiar,

39:58.533 --> 40:01.166
but cloudy,
kind of like in a snowglobe...

40:02.867 --> 40:06.800
I remember going shopping
at the Reading Market,

40:06.867 --> 40:10.533
the neighborhoods with lights,

40:10.600 --> 40:12.567
and yummy food, of course.

40:12.633 --> 40:14.467
-So you remember
the most important thing.

40:14.533 --> 40:16.100
-Yeah.

40:16.166 --> 40:18.400
-Ah, here's what I came for.

40:19.767 --> 40:21.300
Can I get
some of your Bark, please?

40:21.367 --> 40:24.233
Thanks.

40:24.300 --> 40:26.934
I heard you like
Peppermint Bark?

40:27.000 --> 40:30.033
And they are known for theirs.

40:30.100 --> 40:31.066
-Thanks.

40:34.667 --> 40:36.700
Oh! That tiny train set...

40:37.934 --> 40:39.367
will look great
in Brooke's Christmas diorama.

40:40.800 --> 40:41.767
I'll take one of those.

40:43.367 --> 40:44.533
Thank you.

40:44.600 --> 40:45.767
-She'll love it.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.600
What about you?

40:48.667 --> 40:50.433
You don't want anything
special for Christmas?

40:51.467 --> 40:52.800
-Well if you could believe it,

40:52.867 --> 40:55.000
I wished for
an easy-bake oven one year.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.033
-Really?
Was it broken or...

40:59.967 --> 41:01.767
-Turns out
I didn't have much use for it.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.000
Kind of like you and a cookbook?

41:05.500 --> 41:06.467
-Touché.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
-Oh...

41:12.066 --> 41:15.367
I always wanted a chandelier
in my imaginary house.

41:15.433 --> 41:16.600
-"Imaginary house"?

41:16.667 --> 41:18.333
-When I was a kid,

41:18.400 --> 41:20.900
I had a vision
of the perfect house.

41:22.266 --> 41:23.767
I sketched it out
and everything.

41:24.867 --> 41:27.834
I even drew a Santa
on top of the roof

41:27.900 --> 41:29.633
'cause I was worried

41:29.700 --> 41:31.600
that when we moved,
he wouldn't find us.

41:32.734 --> 41:35.166
But my mom always said,

41:35.233 --> 41:36.700
wherever we were,

41:36.767 --> 41:38.800
if I hung my stocking,

41:38.867 --> 41:40.433
Santa would find me.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.433
And he always did.

41:45.567 --> 41:46.433
-What's that about?

41:46.500 --> 41:49.467
-Just checking on
my Christmas planning.

41:49.533 --> 41:51.767
Let's get out of here.
It's getting a bit cold.

41:51.834 --> 41:52.800
-Okay.

42:00.967 --> 42:02.500
Uh...

42:02.567 --> 42:04.033
what is going on here?

42:04.100 --> 42:05.266
-Hi, Taylor.

42:05.333 --> 42:07.734
I'm Jenny,
Adam's little sister.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.367
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

42:10.633 --> 42:13.100
Um, what are you guys
doing here?

42:13.166 --> 42:15.734
-Oh, just delivering Brooke
to her dad.

42:19.100 --> 42:20.500
-Nice Christmas tree...

42:26.066 --> 42:27.667
-What is everyone
smiling about?

42:28.900 --> 42:29.834
-Follow me, Taylor.

42:38.734 --> 42:39.700
-Ta-dah!

42:42.400 --> 42:43.433
-What in the world--

42:43.500 --> 42:45.033
-I told you,
your house needed decorating.

42:46.734 --> 42:47.667
-But--

42:47.734 --> 42:49.500
-And we had tons
of leftover decorations.

42:49.567 --> 42:50.667
And the tree is for you!

42:51.667 --> 42:52.600
-You didn't have to.

42:52.667 --> 42:53.867
-Sure, we did.

42:53.934 --> 42:55.767
-Adam, can you please
help me get the tree off my car?

42:55.834 --> 42:56.934
You have fun, kids.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.400
I'm heading out
to a Christmas party.

43:16.900 --> 43:19.467
-It looks perfect right here.

43:19.533 --> 43:20.467
-Ready?

43:20.533 --> 43:21.600
-These are pretty.

43:24.900 --> 43:26.633
Oh, yes, you do.

43:29.166 --> 43:30.700
-Okay, and do you want one?
-Yes.

43:34.333 --> 43:36.200
-Okay, you're going to have
a good-looking tree.

43:38.300 --> 43:39.100
-All right...

43:39.166 --> 43:41.633
I knew they were
down there somewhere.

43:41.700 --> 43:42.700
Okay...

43:46.200 --> 43:48.633
-It's beautiful.

43:48.700 --> 43:50.800
-It's hand-blown crystal
from Prague.

43:50.867 --> 43:52.967
My parents, they lived there
for two years.

43:53.033 --> 43:54.934
They have an amazing
Christmas market

43:55.000 --> 43:56.400
in the old town square,

43:56.467 --> 43:59.433
with giant trees and vendors.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.333
Just people and music,

44:01.400 --> 44:02.834
and lots and lots of Christmas.

44:05.133 --> 44:06.166
-Dad, look at this one!

44:08.033 --> 44:09.100
-It's beautiful.

44:11.433 --> 44:13.333
-Go ahead, put it on the tree!

44:17.734 --> 44:19.900
-Thank you so much
for everything.

44:19.967 --> 44:21.467
Oh, and Adam?

44:21.533 --> 44:24.033
I wasn't entirely truthful

44:24.100 --> 44:28.500
when I said I was missing
traditional Christmas at home,

44:28.567 --> 44:30.133
'cause all of this--

44:30.200 --> 44:32.600
it's pretty amazing.

44:35.133 --> 44:36.133
-Let's grab our coats, honey.

44:50.934 --> 44:54.200
-Careful, a sugarplum
dropped from that height

44:54.266 --> 44:56.033
could put someone
in a sugar coma.

44:56.100 --> 44:57.333
-Good point.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.266
I'll be careful.

44:58.333 --> 44:59.133
Royal icing works like glue.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.400
-How come they call it
"Royal" icing?

45:01.467 --> 45:03.033
Did a king invent it?

45:03.100 --> 45:04.300
-Not exactly,

45:04.367 --> 45:07.367
but when the bakers were making
Queen Victoria's wedding cake,

45:07.433 --> 45:09.867
they used icing
and confectioners' sugar.

45:09.934 --> 45:10.667
That's when they found out

45:10.734 --> 45:12.133
how strong this stuff
really is.

45:14.333 --> 45:15.400
-All right, guys,
we've got to pick up the pace

45:15.467 --> 45:16.633
so we can start decorating.

45:17.633 --> 45:19.533
-Hey, Taylor?

45:19.600 --> 45:20.834
Never thought I'd be doing
something like this

45:20.900 --> 45:22.066
back in architecture school.

45:22.133 --> 45:24.066
-Well, that makes two of us.

45:24.133 --> 45:25.734
And just like
in architecture school,

45:25.800 --> 45:27.166
we're still competing.

45:27.233 --> 45:29.700
-Well, may the best team win.

45:29.767 --> 45:31.266
So, while the gingerbread panels

45:31.333 --> 45:32.433
settle for the frame,

45:32.500 --> 45:34.533
there's two things we need
before we start decorating.

45:34.600 --> 45:35.533
-What?

45:35.600 --> 45:37.133
-Inspiration...

45:38.133 --> 45:39.000
and Brooke.

45:46.967 --> 45:48.667
-Amazing, huh?

45:48.734 --> 45:50.266
The perfect neighborhood

45:50.333 --> 45:52.033
to get ideas for decorations.

45:53.066 --> 45:54.166
All these lights.

45:54.233 --> 45:56.200
-Well, what do you see
that you like?

45:56.266 --> 45:57.166
-Window boxes!

45:57.233 --> 45:59.233
-Oh! Me too!

45:59.300 --> 46:02.000
So maybe we give
the gingerbread house

46:02.066 --> 46:03.600
window boxes,

46:03.667 --> 46:06.266
but with candycanes
instead of flowers?

46:07.300 --> 46:08.467
-And for lights,

46:08.533 --> 46:10.166
we string together
colored lollipops!

46:10.233 --> 46:11.734
-You are a natural.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.433
So, how about inside the house?

46:15.500 --> 46:19.133
-A gingerbread house
inside of a gingerbread house!

46:19.200 --> 46:20.633
-And a welcome mat.

46:20.700 --> 46:21.934
"Home, Very Sweet Home."

46:22.967 --> 46:23.934
-Perfect.

46:26.900 --> 46:29.433
So who does all this?

46:29.500 --> 46:30.467
-The people
that live on this street.

46:30.533 --> 46:31.467
It's been going on years.

46:31.533 --> 46:32.467
Every Christmas,

46:32.533 --> 46:34.900
it's more and more spectacular.

46:34.967 --> 46:36.166
Families move out,

46:36.233 --> 46:37.333
new families move in,

46:37.400 --> 46:38.767
but the tradition carries on.

46:40.633 --> 46:41.834
-How do you know all this?

46:41.900 --> 46:44.667
-He knows because
the house he grew up in

46:44.734 --> 46:46.066
is just three blocks away.

46:48.834 --> 46:49.834
-Oh!

46:49.900 --> 46:51.233
A fireplace would be great.

46:51.300 --> 46:53.266
I've always wanted
a home with one...

46:53.333 --> 46:54.734
-A fireplace?

46:54.800 --> 46:56.967
Well, how would we make flames
out of candy?

46:57.033 --> 46:59.233
-I'm not sure.

46:59.300 --> 47:01.300
but we do need to make
a candy run

47:01.367 --> 47:02.467
for more decorations,

47:02.533 --> 47:04.533
so we will try and find out.

47:16.233 --> 47:18.266
-Red licorice
doesn't look like flames.

47:22.633 --> 47:23.834
-Maybe orange slices?

47:25.033 --> 47:26.533
-Getting warmer, though.

47:28.734 --> 47:29.734
-I've got it!

47:29.800 --> 47:32.700
Glass candy can look like flames
for the fireplace!

47:32.767 --> 47:34.533
-That's brilliant.

47:34.600 --> 47:37.867
With reds, yellow, orange...

47:37.934 --> 47:39.000
Let's get a case of it.

47:39.066 --> 47:41.633
Oh, and should get loads
of the gumdrops for decorating.

47:44.533 --> 47:45.467
-How can I help you?

47:45.533 --> 47:46.467
-We'll take

47:46.533 --> 47:49.166
all the orange and red
glass candy you've got.

47:49.233 --> 47:51.066
And can I get
some gumdrops, too.

47:51.133 --> 47:52.367
-Sure. How many would you like?

47:52.433 --> 47:53.967
-Maybe 5,000?

47:56.400 --> 47:58.133
No, 10,000!

47:58.200 --> 47:59.533
-You sure about that,
young lady?

47:59.600 --> 48:01.934
-Yeah, she's sure.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.300
She's the Chief Decorating
Officer after all.

48:05.367 --> 48:06.834
-Well, all right then.

48:10.300 --> 48:11.233
-Okay, guys,

48:11.300 --> 48:13.433
you can start
bringing out the gingerbread.

48:13.500 --> 48:16.433
-Whoa, that's a lot of icing.

48:16.500 --> 48:20.266
-Well, we've got
a lot of gingerbread.

48:20.333 --> 48:21.467
-Good morning!

48:21.533 --> 48:24.900
Just stopping by with treats
for this hard-working team.

48:26.367 --> 48:28.600
And I just thought
I would check in

48:28.667 --> 48:29.967
and see how things are going
with the project.

48:30.033 --> 48:31.300
-Excellent.

48:31.367 --> 48:32.700
The gingerbread's baked

48:32.767 --> 48:34.633
and will be up
by the end of the day.

48:34.700 --> 48:35.734
-Oh...

48:35.800 --> 48:39.400
and ahead of the competition
from the looks of it.

48:39.467 --> 48:40.433
Good work, Taylor.

48:42.600 --> 48:43.567
-Uh-oh.

48:44.700 --> 48:45.633
-Uh-oh?

48:45.700 --> 48:46.700
-It's cracking.

48:48.100 --> 48:49.200
-No!

48:49.266 --> 48:50.266
-That's what I worried about--

48:50.333 --> 48:51.867
these thin sheets
of gingerbread are too fragile.

48:51.934 --> 48:53.033
-And I told you,

48:53.100 --> 48:54.467
the thin sheets
are what work best

48:54.533 --> 48:55.934
with my design, remember?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.400
-And remember when I told you

48:57.467 --> 48:58.500
if it was too thin,
they could crack?

48:58.567 --> 48:59.800
-Well, it looks like
we've got a problem.

48:59.867 --> 49:01.667
You better figure that out.

49:01.734 --> 49:03.133
because the clock is ticking

49:03.200 --> 49:05.934
Not much time
until Christmas Eve.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.500
But I know
you're up to the task.

49:20.700 --> 49:23.000
-I think we need to bake
the gingerbread thicker.

49:23.066 --> 49:23.934
More like bricks.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.600
-Look, I know
you warned me about this,

49:25.667 --> 49:27.633
but big bricks won't work
with my design.

49:27.700 --> 49:28.433
-Well, Taylor,

49:28.500 --> 49:30.200
maybe your design
needs to change?

49:30.266 --> 49:32.266
-We have to build on
what we've done,

49:32.333 --> 49:33.967
not start over from scratch.

49:34.033 --> 49:36.533
-You know, my sister has Brooke
for the whole day...

49:36.600 --> 49:37.633
so we have some time.

49:38.734 --> 49:39.934
My Mom always taught me

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
if you can't solve a problem,
you go and do something else,

49:42.066 --> 49:43.800
'cause that's
when you figure it out.

49:43.867 --> 49:46.633
-Do you know
how much work we have to do?

49:47.567 --> 49:48.600
-Come on.

49:49.767 --> 49:51.100
-Okay.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.633
-Seriously?
You've never skated?

50:02.700 --> 50:04.400
-Let's just say
it's been a couple of decades.

50:05.667 --> 50:07.667
-If I'm trying to forget
about cracking gingerbread,

50:07.734 --> 50:09.133
the last thing
that I should be doing

50:09.200 --> 50:10.300
is skating on thin ice.

50:10.367 --> 50:13.533
-It's not thin.
It's normal ice.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.433
-And I should trust you on this?

50:15.500 --> 50:17.767
Okay. Fine. Fine.
Let's do it.

50:17.834 --> 50:19.734
-You want to push off
with each foot...

50:21.000 --> 50:22.500
Let's go. Come on.

50:22.567 --> 50:23.934
-I don't know.
-You've got this.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.533
-This might be
a bit too advanced for me.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.100
How are you so good?

50:28.166 --> 50:29.934
-We had a skating rink

50:30.000 --> 50:31.300
in our backyard as a kid,

50:31.367 --> 50:32.133
and every winter,

50:32.200 --> 50:35.633
we'd lay out the 4x4
and the liner,

50:35.700 --> 50:37.633
and turn the hose on.

50:37.700 --> 50:40.166
The next morning,
bingo, mini skating rink.

50:40.233 --> 50:42.467
-Although--
-Although what?

50:42.533 --> 50:45.033
-One winter, I left the hose on.

50:45.100 --> 50:46.000
-Oh, no!

50:46.066 --> 50:47.166
Your poor parents.

50:47.233 --> 50:48.266
-My Mom took it in stride,

50:48.333 --> 50:51.033
but she invited all the kids
in the neighborhood down

50:51.100 --> 50:53.767
to winter wonderland.

50:53.834 --> 50:54.967
She even made
gingerbread cookies.

50:55.033 --> 50:55.800
-Aw.

50:55.867 --> 50:57.767
Your mom sounds like
a lot of fun.

50:57.834 --> 50:59.700
-So I'm going to let go.
You're going to be okay.

50:59.767 --> 51:01.433
-No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

51:01.500 --> 51:03.033
I don't think I'm ready.

51:03.100 --> 51:06.333
-So... why are you doing it?

51:06.400 --> 51:07.867
-What?

51:07.934 --> 51:08.900
-Skating. Look!

51:11.567 --> 51:13.100
-Oh, my gosh, I'm doing it.

51:13.166 --> 51:14.767
-And don't think about it
too much.

51:14.834 --> 51:16.166
-Okay.

51:16.233 --> 51:19.000
-Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

51:20.767 --> 51:23.667
-So did the skating make you
come up with any new ideas?

51:25.834 --> 51:27.600
-I'm still stumped
about my design,

51:27.667 --> 51:29.166
but this was fun.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.433
And I forgot about
our problems for a while.

51:31.500 --> 51:32.834
-I know your boss wants you

51:32.900 --> 51:34.667
to come up with
this cutting-edge idea,

51:34.734 --> 51:36.834
but maybe
the new cutting-edge

51:36.900 --> 51:37.867
could be tradition?

51:39.567 --> 51:41.166
-Hmm...

52:07.033 --> 52:08.266
-Hey, Josephine.

52:08.333 --> 52:10.033
-Hi, Taylor.
Any new ideas?

52:10.100 --> 52:12.734
-I am so stressed out.

52:12.800 --> 52:15.033
-But I thought
things were going great.

52:15.100 --> 52:15.900
-Well, I'm not so sure

52:15.967 --> 52:17.533
the modern design
is the way to go.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.600
Time is running out,

52:19.667 --> 52:21.300
and now we're back
to the drawing board.

52:21.367 --> 52:23.433
I'm afraid
Linda won't be happy.

52:23.500 --> 52:25.100
-You'll figure it out.
You're you!

52:25.166 --> 52:27.633
-Thank you, Jos'.

52:27.700 --> 52:28.734
I'll see you tomorrow?

52:28.800 --> 52:29.734
-Bye.

53:35.400 --> 53:37.834
-And it won't take a lot of work
to re-design the frame.

53:37.900 --> 53:40.433
All we need to do
is change up the roof,

53:40.500 --> 53:41.667
add the flower boxes,

53:41.734 --> 53:44.166
and go with bricks.

53:44.233 --> 53:45.333
What do you think?

53:45.400 --> 53:47.300
-I like it.

53:47.367 --> 53:49.033
How did you come up
with the design?

53:49.100 --> 53:52.600
-Actually, I dug up a sketch
I drew when I was little.

53:52.667 --> 53:54.300
Kind of went from there.

53:54.367 --> 53:56.133
Call it an inspiration.

53:57.433 --> 53:58.467
-I love it.

53:58.533 --> 53:59.433
But...

53:59.500 --> 54:00.533
I thought you wanted
something cutting-edge.

54:00.600 --> 54:04.066
-Well, it won't be
the design Linda asked for,

54:04.133 --> 54:06.867
but she will be cheering
the loudest when we win.

54:06.934 --> 54:08.867
-Well, we'd better get to work.

54:13.100 --> 54:16.567
-All right,
I will get this rolled out,

54:16.633 --> 54:17.967
and cut it into bricks.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.266
-She caught on to baking
pretty quick.

54:23.333 --> 54:25.700
-And how are things going
outside of the kitchen?

54:26.734 --> 54:27.834
-Well, we had a big setback,

54:27.900 --> 54:30.066
but we have a new plan
for the house--

54:30.133 --> 54:32.233
-I wasn't talking
about the gingerbread house.

54:32.300 --> 54:34.734
I mean, how are things going
with Taylor?

54:51.166 --> 54:52.767
-Okay, yeah.

54:52.834 --> 54:54.600
We can put it up
a little more.

54:54.667 --> 54:55.367
Yeah.

54:55.433 --> 54:56.667
Perfect. Perfect.
Right there.

54:59.767 --> 55:01.400
-What are they doing?

55:14.700 --> 55:15.800
-Looks good.

55:45.533 --> 55:46.600
-What number should it be?

55:48.967 --> 55:50.734
-What's the number of the house
you grew up in?

55:50.800 --> 55:52.233
-27.

55:52.300 --> 55:53.567
-Then that's the address.

55:53.633 --> 55:55.000
-Cool.

55:55.066 --> 55:56.400
-All right,

55:56.467 --> 55:57.734
we may have lost a day,

55:57.800 --> 55:59.834
but we are almost on track.

55:59.900 --> 56:01.934
Tomorrow, we're going
to have to pick up the pace.

56:03.200 --> 56:04.300
-Brooke, honey, it's time to go.

56:04.367 --> 56:05.834
We're gonna give Taylor
a lift home.

56:08.033 --> 56:10.967
And there's something
we want to show you on the way.

56:11.033 --> 56:12.633
-Okay.

56:15.066 --> 56:16.300
-We're almost there.

56:16.367 --> 56:17.633
-Oh, my goodness.

56:22.200 --> 56:26.133
-Okay...
-Okay?

56:26.200 --> 56:27.166
-Open!

56:30.133 --> 56:31.200
-What is this?

56:31.266 --> 56:33.734
-It's a landing strip
for Santa's reindeer and sleigh!

56:33.800 --> 56:34.800
-It's the city's way

56:34.867 --> 56:36.633
of making sure that,
even if there's a blizzard,

56:36.700 --> 56:37.700
Santa can find us.

56:37.767 --> 56:39.467
-And it always works.

56:39.533 --> 56:42.066
I've even seen
a reindeer's print in the snow

56:42.133 --> 56:43.500
when we come here
on Christmas Day!

56:43.567 --> 56:45.700
-Is that so?

56:45.767 --> 56:46.667
-Come on, I'll show you

56:46.734 --> 56:48.200
where you can leave
a snack for the reindeer

56:48.266 --> 56:49.600
in case they get hungry.

56:50.600 --> 56:51.600
-Okay.

57:04.333 --> 57:07.133
-So, what do you think?

57:07.200 --> 57:08.700
-I think it's pretty amazing.

57:10.266 --> 57:11.233
Adam...

57:12.500 --> 57:13.633
I just want to thank you.

57:13.700 --> 57:15.367
-For what?

57:16.600 --> 57:19.567
-For the first time
in a while...

57:19.633 --> 57:22.100
I feel like
I'm home for Christmas.

57:22.166 --> 57:23.567
-I'm glad.

57:29.333 --> 57:31.700
-It's beautiful.

57:37.800 --> 57:39.266
-Thanks for the ride.

57:39.333 --> 57:40.367
Tomorrow's December 20th.

57:40.433 --> 57:41.967
Just three days left
to decorate.

57:42.033 --> 57:43.400
-We'll be ready!

57:46.700 --> 57:47.900
-Hello?

57:47.967 --> 57:50.400
-Sorry for calling
so late, Taylor.

57:50.467 --> 57:51.700
-Oh, no, that's fine.

57:51.767 --> 57:54.100
Is everything okay?

57:54.166 --> 57:56.567
-More than okay.

57:56.633 --> 57:58.200
Listen, I appreciate

57:58.266 --> 58:00.533
how you've taken the reins
with the competition.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.033
-Thank you.

58:02.100 --> 58:05.133
-Clearly, you've held up
your end of our little deal,

58:05.200 --> 58:07.433
so... I have

58:07.500 --> 58:09.033
an early Christmas present
for you.

58:09.100 --> 58:12.266
Can you say "Joyeux Noel"?

58:12.333 --> 58:13.800
-What do you mean?

58:13.867 --> 58:14.734
-Well, I had dinner

58:14.800 --> 58:16.266
with a few
of our board members tonight,

58:16.333 --> 58:17.100
and, you know,

58:17.166 --> 58:19.133
they'll make
a formal decision later,

58:19.200 --> 58:20.867
but you're the front runner
for Paris--

58:20.934 --> 58:22.934
which means you'll be
heading out on Christmas Eve.

58:24.266 --> 58:25.166
-Christmas Eve?

58:25.233 --> 58:27.467
-I know you don't have
plans for Christmas,

58:27.533 --> 58:28.967
so I made some for you!

58:29.033 --> 58:32.500
A chance to celebrate Christmas
in the City of Lights.

58:32.567 --> 58:36.000
Oh, and I even got you
an invite for a Christmas party

58:36.066 --> 58:37.734
at the Minister of Culture's
chateau.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.200
-Oh...

58:40.266 --> 58:41.200
Um...

58:41.266 --> 58:42.200
that's so soon.

58:42.266 --> 58:44.633
-I thought you'd be more
excited.

58:44.700 --> 58:46.133
I mean, isn't this
what you were pushing for?

58:46.200 --> 58:48.700
-Of course. Of course.

58:48.767 --> 58:50.000
Thank you so much.

58:50.066 --> 58:53.033
I can't wait.

58:53.100 --> 58:54.533
Let me know
what the board decides.

58:54.600 --> 58:55.533
-Okay.

58:55.600 --> 58:56.567
Bye, Taylor.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.333
Just a little more decorating.

59:15.300 --> 59:16.667
-Where did everyone go?

59:16.734 --> 59:19.133
-You must have
really been in the zone.

59:19.200 --> 59:20.467
I let the rest of the team go.

59:20.533 --> 59:23.834
Holidays and such,
and they were tired.

59:23.900 --> 59:25.133
-Well, I don't blame them.

59:25.200 --> 59:26.233
I'm kind of tired, too.

59:26.300 --> 59:27.367
-So...

59:27.433 --> 59:28.367
have a seat.

59:28.433 --> 59:30.133
-Okay.

59:32.934 --> 59:34.433
Thank you.

59:40.233 --> 59:41.300
-Look at us.

59:41.367 --> 59:42.367
Just a couple of folks,

59:42.433 --> 59:46.133
sitting on our stoop,
watching the world go by.

59:46.200 --> 59:47.633
-Nice little place we got here.

59:47.700 --> 59:49.533
-Our own little chalet.

59:51.033 --> 59:54.734
-You know, I have to admit,
the traditional roof is nice.

59:54.800 --> 59:57.400
-We do have
some serious competition

59:57.467 --> 59:58.400
from our neighbors,

59:58.467 --> 1:00:00.233
who built quite the skyscraper.

1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:02.967
-Winning would be
the icing on the cake,

1:00:03.033 --> 1:00:05.500
but I only entered
this crazy competition

1:00:05.567 --> 1:00:08.233
to show Brooke
her Dad can dream big.

1:00:08.300 --> 1:00:10.734
-And why just dreaming?

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:12.967
And not make your bakery dream
a reality?

1:00:13.033 --> 1:00:15.333
-Ask the investors
who turned me down.

1:00:16.433 --> 1:00:17.500
-Well, you didn't have

1:00:17.567 --> 1:00:21.567
your glorious gingerbread win
under your belt then!

1:00:21.633 --> 1:00:23.867
-Well, fingers crossed.

1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:27.667
You know, this...
this takes me back.

1:00:27.734 --> 1:00:29.567
Sitting at
the front of the house,

1:00:29.633 --> 1:00:31.200
with the family,

1:00:31.266 --> 1:00:32.800
a little music playing...

1:00:33.934 --> 1:00:36.333
-I have an idea.

1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:38.667
Do you think we could use music
for our gingerbread house?

1:00:40.233 --> 1:00:41.166
-That's a great idea.

1:00:41.233 --> 1:00:43.700
I mean, we already have
four of the five senses.

1:00:43.767 --> 1:00:44.800
-Mm-hmm.

1:00:44.867 --> 1:00:46.467
-Sight, smell...

1:00:46.533 --> 1:00:48.867
taste, touch...

1:00:48.934 --> 1:00:50.233
and hearing...

1:00:50.300 --> 1:00:51.834
also, that would be great.

1:00:52.967 --> 1:00:56.133
-How about a doorbell
that plays music?

1:00:56.200 --> 1:00:57.533
Or isn't that
traditional enough for you?

1:00:58.533 --> 1:00:59.633
-I'll allow it.

1:01:00.967 --> 1:01:02.567
-What kind of music?

1:01:02.633 --> 1:01:04.633
-Um, a carol maybe?

1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:06.433
Something up-tempo.

1:01:11.967 --> 1:01:12.900
-This one?

1:01:12.967 --> 1:01:14.767
-It's a good song to dance to.

1:01:14.834 --> 1:01:16.000
Here, let me show you.

1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:17.934
-Huh?

1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:19.900
-What? You can't dance?

1:01:19.967 --> 1:01:21.467
-Oh, I can dance, all right.

1:02:05.667 --> 1:02:07.500
-What's going on over here?

1:02:07.567 --> 1:02:09.200
-Just working on our house.

1:02:09.266 --> 1:02:10.467
-This place yours?

1:02:10.533 --> 1:02:12.066
-Yep, all of it.

1:02:13.066 --> 1:02:14.266
-Wait until
you see it finished.

1:02:14.333 --> 1:02:15.867
-Looks good...

1:02:15.934 --> 1:02:18.166
but you can't really
be here right now.

1:02:18.233 --> 1:02:20.667
I've got this place on lockdown
like Fort Knox.

1:02:20.734 --> 1:02:22.100
Anything happens
to these houses,

1:02:22.166 --> 1:02:23.467
it's on me.

1:02:23.533 --> 1:02:24.967
We're about to head out,

1:02:25.033 --> 1:02:26.567
but do you want a taste?

1:02:28.767 --> 1:02:29.800
-I'm on duty.

1:02:29.867 --> 1:02:31.133
Though...

1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:32.600
I suppose a nibble
wouldn't hurt.

1:02:37.533 --> 1:02:38.467
Baked fresh this morning.

1:02:43.333 --> 1:02:45.867
-Not bad.
Not bad at all.

1:02:45.934 --> 1:02:47.567
Well, carry on.

1:02:48.867 --> 1:02:49.934
Merry Christmas.

1:02:52.033 --> 1:02:53.333
-So ends our dancing.

1:02:55.033 --> 1:02:57.166
-Okay, we have
a big day tomorrow.

1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:07.066
-Our fireplace looks amazing!

1:03:07.133 --> 1:03:08.400
Glass candy flames--

1:03:08.467 --> 1:03:09.367
who'd have thought it?

1:03:09.433 --> 1:03:11.734
-Our Chief Decorating Officer,
that's who.

1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:14.600
-So, how does
dusting the windows

1:03:14.667 --> 1:03:17.266
with icing sugar
and grated coconut sound?

1:03:17.333 --> 1:03:19.066
To give it
that morning frost look?

1:03:19.133 --> 1:03:20.700
-I love a morning frost.

1:03:20.767 --> 1:03:23.266
Or a fresh snowfall.

1:03:23.333 --> 1:03:24.333
Can we do that?

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:25.367
-Yeah. Of course.

1:03:26.433 --> 1:03:28.066
There's just one more thing--

1:03:28.133 --> 1:03:30.900
Here's a little project
I've been working on...

1:03:33.333 --> 1:03:35.000
-A candy chandelier?

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.100
All in your spare time?

1:03:37.166 --> 1:03:38.800
Adam, it's wonderful.

1:03:42.233 --> 1:03:43.734
-And I have one more idea!

1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:46.233
We need pictures on the walls.
Of a family!

1:03:46.300 --> 1:03:48.500
-Good point.
It is a home, after all.

1:03:48.567 --> 1:03:49.633
It needs that lived-in look.

1:03:49.700 --> 1:03:51.900
-We could always put up
some pictures up on the mantle.

1:03:51.967 --> 1:03:55.300
-Why don't we take a photo
of the three of us?

1:03:57.900 --> 1:03:59.667
-Um...

1:03:59.734 --> 1:04:01.066
sure.

1:04:01.133 --> 1:04:02.533
-Come on.

1:04:10.166 --> 1:04:12.100
-Taylor, get in
a little closer.

1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:21.133
-I love how this place
is coming together.

1:04:22.567 --> 1:04:24.500
-It does prove
that anything is possible.

1:04:24.567 --> 1:04:26.033
Like you and I
working as a team.

1:04:27.633 --> 1:04:31.433
So, what happens
if you win anyway?

1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:33.300
Linda give you
a big corner office?

1:04:33.367 --> 1:04:34.767
-Kind of.

1:04:37.533 --> 1:04:39.867
Actually, I've been meaning
to mention something.

1:04:41.467 --> 1:04:42.834
If all goes off well,

1:04:42.900 --> 1:04:44.700
I might have
some news of my own...

1:04:49.233 --> 1:04:50.433
-Bonsoir.

1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:52.667
-Oh, Annabelle. Hi.

1:04:52.734 --> 1:04:54.433
-Yes, hello.

1:04:54.500 --> 1:04:56.967
Look, I just wanted to say...

1:04:57.033 --> 1:04:58.300
I'm impressed.

1:04:58.367 --> 1:05:00.734
I've been watching you two.

1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:02.400
You had an enormous setback,

1:05:02.467 --> 1:05:04.867
but you really bounced back.

1:05:06.367 --> 1:05:10.133
Your gingerbread house
is actually quite good.

1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:12.400
-I'm glad you like it.

1:05:12.467 --> 1:05:14.800
But it's mostly
thanks to our baker here.

1:05:14.867 --> 1:05:18.533
-Well, if there's anything
I can appreciate,

1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:20.333
it's talent and hard work.

1:05:21.567 --> 1:05:22.934
Allez, bonne chance.

1:05:24.867 --> 1:05:27.533
-A kind word from Annabelle.

1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:28.967
Did I hear that right?

1:05:29.033 --> 1:05:30.266
-A Christmas miracle.

1:05:31.700 --> 1:05:34.266
By the way, what is it
you wanted to tell me?

1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:39.800
-Nothing important.

1:06:54.033 --> 1:06:57.133
Let the last day
of decorating begin!

1:07:00.367 --> 1:07:01.800
-It's the final stretch
for teams here,

1:07:01.867 --> 1:07:04.100
at the Giant
Gingerbread Competition.

1:07:50.567 --> 1:07:52.367
-Only a few minutes left!

1:07:52.433 --> 1:07:55.767
-We literally have
nothing left to decorate.

1:07:55.834 --> 1:07:57.033
I'd say we're done here.

1:07:57.100 --> 1:07:59.100
-I saw one of the other houses
has a name.

1:07:59.166 --> 1:08:01.700
So what's the name of our house?

1:08:01.767 --> 1:08:05.233
-Good question.

1:08:05.300 --> 1:08:07.467
Maybe something
with "home" in it?

1:08:08.467 --> 1:08:10.400
-I saw you hang
your stocking on the mantle.

1:08:11.433 --> 1:08:12.734
-I thought
it was pretty fitting.

1:08:14.567 --> 1:08:17.200
-We've got
something else for the mantle.

1:08:18.767 --> 1:08:20.533
-I love it.
That's perfect.

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:22.633
-I'll go put it inside.

1:08:29.467 --> 1:08:30.400
-Traditional.

1:08:30.467 --> 1:08:32.667
Bold and new.

1:08:32.734 --> 1:08:37.700
-Maybe I need to try
something bold and new myself.

1:08:37.767 --> 1:08:40.066
-Maybe another try
at your own bakery?

1:08:40.133 --> 1:08:41.433
-I was thinking the same thing.

1:08:41.500 --> 1:08:42.900
In fact, I invited

1:08:42.967 --> 1:08:45.000
some of the investors
to the judging,

1:08:45.066 --> 1:08:46.333
so thanks for the push.

1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:47.800
-My pleasure.

1:08:49.133 --> 1:08:51.033
-Taylor, I know you can't be

1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:52.333
with your Mom and Dad
this Christmas,

1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:53.567
but, if you wanted,

1:08:53.633 --> 1:08:55.033
Brooke and I...

1:08:55.100 --> 1:08:56.700
we're hoping

1:08:56.767 --> 1:08:59.000
you'd spend
Christmas with us?

1:09:02.367 --> 1:09:06.300
-That's the best invitation
I've ever gotten.

1:09:06.367 --> 1:09:08.967
-Well, everyone needs a place
for the holidays.

1:09:09.033 --> 1:09:10.400
-That's it!

1:09:10.467 --> 1:09:11.500
-What?

1:09:11.567 --> 1:09:12.934
-The name of the house.

1:09:14.667 --> 1:09:16.533
"A Home for the Holidays."

1:09:17.834 --> 1:09:19.333
It's perfect.

1:09:23.233 --> 1:09:24.100
-Hey.

1:09:24.166 --> 1:09:25.700
I just had to come
and see it for myself.

1:09:27.967 --> 1:09:30.734
-That... is not the plan
we discussed.

1:09:32.700 --> 1:09:33.734
-But I love it!

1:09:34.567 --> 1:09:36.100
Great job.

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:38.133
Oh, and, Taylor,

1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:39.333
I'm going to be sorry
to see you go,

1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:41.900
but the board met,
and it's official.

1:09:41.967 --> 1:09:43.233
You're on your way!

1:09:45.567 --> 1:09:46.800
Au revoir.

1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:50.633
-What does she mean?

1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:52.800
-Adam, I was going to tell you--

1:09:52.867 --> 1:09:54.367
-Tell me what?

1:09:55.667 --> 1:09:56.633
-We need to talk.

1:09:58.533 --> 1:10:00.567
-The judging for the Giant
Gingerbread Competition

1:10:00.633 --> 1:10:02.367
will take place
tomorrow at noon.

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:09.333
-Wow. Paris.

1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:11.567
Pretty hard
to compete with that.

1:10:12.967 --> 1:10:18.600
-Well, it's a dream job
I've wanted for years.

1:10:18.667 --> 1:10:21.266
I thought I'd have
more time to decide.

1:10:21.333 --> 1:10:23.000
-So, I guess you won't be

1:10:23.066 --> 1:10:25.166
joining us
for Christmas this year.

1:10:25.233 --> 1:10:28.233
-Adam, believe me,

1:10:28.300 --> 1:10:29.767
I want to spend Christmas
with you and Brooke,

1:10:29.834 --> 1:10:30.767
it's just...

1:10:30.834 --> 1:10:32.500
-Hey, don't worry.

1:10:32.567 --> 1:10:33.867
I'll explain it to Brooke.

1:10:35.033 --> 1:10:35.900
After all, Santa's got

1:10:35.967 --> 1:10:38.233
a lot of places
to visit this year, right?

1:10:50.033 --> 1:10:51.567
-Sweetheart.

1:10:51.633 --> 1:10:52.400
My friend, Diana,

1:10:52.467 --> 1:10:53.333
emailed that she saw
a news report

1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:57.100
about you and some
giant gingerbread house?

1:10:57.166 --> 1:10:59.266
-Well, you know the expression

1:10:59.333 --> 1:11:01.800
"truth is stranger
than fiction"?

1:11:02.900 --> 1:11:04.633
That's pretty much
the case here.

1:11:04.700 --> 1:11:05.900
-Diana also mentioned

1:11:05.967 --> 1:11:07.867
something about you working
pretty closely

1:11:07.934 --> 1:11:09.166
with a handsome young man?

1:11:09.233 --> 1:11:10.667
-That's Adam.

1:11:10.734 --> 1:11:12.867
He's the baker
doing the project with me.

1:11:12.934 --> 1:11:13.834
He's nice...

1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:15.533
-Nice, huh?

1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:17.500
I can see you blushing.

1:11:18.633 --> 1:11:20.233
-It's just--

1:11:20.300 --> 1:11:21.533
It's just, I don't know, Mom.

1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:23.000
-What's wrong, honey?

1:11:23.066 --> 1:11:25.300
-I got offered
the job in Paris.

1:11:25.367 --> 1:11:28.000
-That's great, isn't it?

1:11:28.066 --> 1:11:29.000
-Yes. It's just...

1:11:29.066 --> 1:11:30.834
Philadelphia has been...

1:11:30.900 --> 1:11:32.900
growing on me.

1:11:32.967 --> 1:11:36.967
There's so much
feeling of Christmas here.

1:11:37.033 --> 1:11:38.734
It's kind of starting
to feel like...

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:39.800
-Like home?

1:11:39.867 --> 1:11:42.834
Home is wherever you hang
your Christmas stocking.

1:11:43.867 --> 1:11:44.667
You'll know in your heart

1:11:44.734 --> 1:11:45.900
when you've found
the right place--

1:11:45.967 --> 1:11:47.867
or the right person.

1:11:49.100 --> 1:11:50.367
-Thanks, Mom.

1:11:50.433 --> 1:11:51.433
I love you.

1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:53.367
I'll call you and Dad
tomorrow on Christmas Day.

1:11:53.433 --> 1:11:55.000
-Looking forward to it.

1:11:55.066 --> 1:11:56.667
Love you.

1:12:05.433 --> 1:12:08.367
-My kids have been asking me
every day for the past week

1:12:08.433 --> 1:12:10.400
when this day would come.

1:12:10.467 --> 1:12:12.734
-Well, I promise
we won't disappoint.

1:12:16.633 --> 1:12:17.967
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:12:18.033 --> 1:12:18.934
-About yesterday,

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.300
I'm sorry I didn't mention--

1:12:20.367 --> 1:12:21.600
-Don't worry about it.

1:12:21.667 --> 1:12:23.467
I'm happy for you.

1:12:23.533 --> 1:12:25.467
-Happy Holidays, everybody!

1:12:25.533 --> 1:12:27.400
And welcome to the judging

1:12:27.467 --> 1:12:31.166
of our first ever Giant
Gingerbread House Competition!

1:12:33.934 --> 1:12:36.667
Could I please have our teams
approach the stage?

1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:39.567
Come on up.

1:12:42.500 --> 1:12:45.200
Now, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1:12:45.266 --> 1:12:50.066
May I present
our first gingerbread house,

1:12:50.133 --> 1:12:52.500
Snowman Sanctuary...

1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:58.767
-Our second entry...

1:12:58.834 --> 1:13:00.300
the Elf Castle!

1:13:05.767 --> 1:13:07.667
-Next, we have...

1:13:07.734 --> 1:13:09.800
The Northern Tower!

1:13:12.867 --> 1:13:14.333
-Theirs is really tall.

1:13:17.233 --> 1:13:18.233
-My goodness,

1:13:18.300 --> 1:13:19.266
that could go in a museum
someplace, am I right?

1:13:21.166 --> 1:13:24.633
-And now, may I present,
our final gingerbread house,

1:13:24.700 --> 1:13:27.934
A Home for the Holidays!

1:13:29.834 --> 1:13:31.667
-Three, two, one...

1:13:38.767 --> 1:13:40.834
-I told you
I love a fresh snowfall.

1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:50.934
-Well, to say all of our entries
exceeded expectations

1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.867
would be an understatement,

1:13:52.934 --> 1:13:55.834
but this is a contest,

1:13:55.900 --> 1:13:57.967
so, unfortunately,
we have to pick a winner.

1:13:58.033 --> 1:13:59.467
Judges, your results, please.

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:05.000
And the winner

1:14:05.066 --> 1:14:07.033
of our first
Giant Gingerbread Contest

1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:08.133
is...

1:14:13.133 --> 1:14:16.066
A Home for the Holidays!

1:14:16.133 --> 1:14:17.133
-Taylor, we won!

1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:21.700
Congratulations, Ray's Bakery!

1:14:21.767 --> 1:14:22.734
Congratulations!

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:28.734
-You did it.

1:14:28.800 --> 1:14:30.166
-We did it.

1:14:31.166 --> 1:14:33.934
And I bet your investors
are pretty impressed.

1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.266
Where are they?

1:14:35.333 --> 1:14:36.533
-Actually...

1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:38.333
they weren't able to make it.

1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:39.333
-Oh, I'm sorry.

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:40.700
-Don't be.

1:14:40.767 --> 1:14:41.834
It doesn't matter!

1:14:41.900 --> 1:14:43.066
What matters is we won!

1:14:45.567 --> 1:14:46.900
-Congratulations.

1:14:46.967 --> 1:14:49.166
-Yeah, that was
really something.

1:14:49.233 --> 1:14:50.433
-Thank you.

1:14:50.500 --> 1:14:53.533
I mean, your house
is spectacular.

1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:55.066
-Yeah, we're pretty proud of it.

1:14:55.133 --> 1:14:56.400
-Adam.

1:14:56.467 --> 1:14:59.767
Your flare for design
is quite exceptional.

1:14:59.834 --> 1:15:01.433
-Thank you,

1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:03.734
and you're impressive
as always.

1:15:05.133 --> 1:15:07.567
-You know, I am looking for
a new assistant.

1:15:07.633 --> 1:15:10.500
-Thank you, Annabelle,
but I already have a job.

1:15:10.567 --> 1:15:11.767
-Fine.

1:15:11.834 --> 1:15:13.333
But if you ever do open
your own place,

1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:15.567
please, do invite me
to the opening.

1:15:18.166 --> 1:15:19.433
Bon, alors, bonne soirée.

1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:20.633
-Great job.

1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.300
-So...

1:15:25.367 --> 1:15:27.100
when are you leaving?

1:15:28.133 --> 1:15:30.066
-I fly out tonight.

1:15:30.133 --> 1:15:32.033
-Thank you for believing in me.

1:15:33.033 --> 1:15:34.900
I'm glad we made it happen.

1:15:34.967 --> 1:15:36.333
-Me too.

1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:37.800
Are you really leaving?

1:15:37.867 --> 1:15:39.633
On Christmas Eve?

1:15:39.700 --> 1:15:42.467
-Oh, sweetie...

1:15:42.533 --> 1:15:44.467
I have to.

1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:47.967
But I had a great time.

1:15:48.033 --> 1:15:49.734
-Bye, Taylor.

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:51.533
-Bye, Brooke.

1:16:03.533 --> 1:16:05.533
-Merry Christmas...

1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:07.266
-Merry Christmas.

1:16:22.300 --> 1:16:24.166
-Are you kidding,
it's the least I can do.

1:16:25.166 --> 1:16:26.633
-Well, the movers said

1:16:26.700 --> 1:16:28.433
they'd come
the day after Christmas.

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:30.867
Most everything
is already boxed up.

1:16:31.700 --> 1:16:35.567
If you could just
give them the keys.

1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:38.533
-Consider it done.

1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:39.767
We'll miss you,

1:16:39.834 --> 1:16:41.867
but Paris for Christmas...

1:16:41.934 --> 1:16:43.200
I guess you'll be calling
the City of Lights

1:16:43.266 --> 1:16:44.266
your new home.

1:16:45.767 --> 1:16:48.033
-Yes...

1:16:48.100 --> 1:16:49.133
Home.

1:16:53.133 --> 1:16:54.100
-That must be your shuttle.

1:16:55.767 --> 1:16:57.367
-Merry Christmas.

1:17:02.333 --> 1:17:03.567
-Have a good flight.

1:17:04.834 --> 1:17:06.066
-Thank you.

1:17:23.433 --> 1:17:24.934
-Christmas is tomorrow.

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:26.333
Think I could order
a gingerbread house?

1:17:27.233 --> 1:17:28.533
-I'm afraid I just
don't have time.

1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:29.600
I'm so sorry.

1:17:29.667 --> 1:17:32.033
Will you take a bell cake,
as a Christmas present?

1:17:33.266 --> 1:17:34.667
-You're a lifesaver, Adam.

1:17:38.100 --> 1:17:39.934
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

1:17:40.934 --> 1:17:43.200
-Well, that's another one.

1:17:43.266 --> 1:17:44.533
You're turning away
customers, Adam.

1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:46.800
-We're behind on gingersnaps,

1:17:46.867 --> 1:17:48.233
the sugar cookies
are running low, and--

1:17:48.300 --> 1:17:49.700
-Adam, slow down.

1:17:49.767 --> 1:17:51.500
I can get help for all that.

1:17:51.567 --> 1:17:53.233
-We're a neighborhood bakery,

1:17:53.300 --> 1:17:55.300
selling to people
what they expect.

1:17:55.367 --> 1:17:56.400
Now, all of the sudden,

1:17:56.467 --> 1:17:57.800
we have people
coming in here

1:17:57.867 --> 1:17:58.734
every five minutes,

1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:00.233
asking for your cakes.

1:18:01.166 --> 1:18:02.800
There's lines outside the door.

1:18:02.867 --> 1:18:06.066
-Ray, is this a roundabout way
of saying you're firing me?

1:18:06.133 --> 1:18:07.400
-Firing you?

1:18:07.467 --> 1:18:09.367
I'm talking about
making you a partner.

1:18:09.433 --> 1:18:11.934
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.767
-We have people
banging down our doors

1:18:13.834 --> 1:18:14.900
to get to your cakes.

1:18:14.967 --> 1:18:17.900
Now, I know you've always wanted
to open your own bakery,

1:18:17.967 --> 1:18:19.200
so why not open it
right in here?

1:18:19.266 --> 1:18:20.967
-I don't follow.

1:18:21.033 --> 1:18:23.533
-I'm talking about
your own display case,

1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:25.734
your name out front.

1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:27.300
What do you say, partner?

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.500
-It sounds pretty good to me.

1:18:32.533 --> 1:18:34.467
-Well, we got that
taken care of.

1:18:34.533 --> 1:18:36.400
-Wait till Brooke
hears about this.

1:18:37.500 --> 1:18:39.600
-And Taylor--
what about her?

1:18:39.667 --> 1:18:41.300
You know, ever since
you found out she was leaving,

1:18:41.367 --> 1:18:42.967
you haven't smiled much.

1:18:43.033 --> 1:18:45.567
So why don't you go tell her
how you feel

1:18:45.633 --> 1:18:47.767
and let her decide
if she wants to leave or not.

1:18:48.700 --> 1:18:52.266
-Ray...

1:18:52.333 --> 1:18:54.266
I don't want to stop Taylor
from living her life.

1:18:54.333 --> 1:18:55.166
-All I'm saying

1:18:55.233 --> 1:18:57.433
is Taylor's the one
who walked in here

1:18:57.500 --> 1:18:58.934
and asked you to partner up.

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:00.600
She came to you, cap in hand.

1:19:01.667 --> 1:19:03.300
Now, maybe it's your turn
to do the same?

1:19:05.166 --> 1:19:07.500
-Is it that obvious how I feel?

1:19:07.567 --> 1:19:08.400
-Please.

1:19:08.467 --> 1:19:10.533
I can tell
you don't want Taylor to go.

1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:11.533
So tell her.

1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:12.967
-And what if she leaves anyway?

1:19:13.033 --> 1:19:14.300
-Well, then she leaves.

1:19:14.367 --> 1:19:15.967
At least she'll know
how you feel.

1:19:19.567 --> 1:19:20.667
-Thanks, Ray.

1:19:37.567 --> 1:19:38.767
-Thank goodness.
I thought I missed--

1:19:40.934 --> 1:19:42.767
-Wendy?
Is Taylor here?

1:19:42.834 --> 1:19:43.700
-Sorry, Adam.

1:19:43.767 --> 1:19:45.166
I was just boxing up
some of her things.

1:19:45.233 --> 1:19:46.133
She was in a hurry.

1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:48.100
She left for the airport
a couple hours ago.

1:19:48.166 --> 1:19:50.734
Her flight's taking off
any minute.

1:19:59.934 --> 1:20:04.166
-This is a pre-boarding call
for flight 714 bound for Paris.

1:20:04.233 --> 1:20:05.166
At this time,

1:20:05.233 --> 1:20:06.467
anyone requiring assistance

1:20:06.533 --> 1:20:07.600
or traveling
with small children,

1:20:07.667 --> 1:20:08.967
please check in.

1:20:33.367 --> 1:20:34.533
-Excuse me,

1:20:34.600 --> 1:20:36.533
but a family
that just boarded

1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:38.700
forgot this.

1:20:38.767 --> 1:20:39.834
-I'll make sure they get it.

1:20:50.266 --> 1:20:51.333
-Linda?

1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:54.033
This is Taylor.

1:20:54.100 --> 1:20:55.500
We need to talk.

1:21:02.767 --> 1:21:04.033
-Look, Dad, new skates!

1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:04.900
Santa even remembered

1:21:04.967 --> 1:21:07.767
I was wishing
for pink skate guards.

1:21:07.834 --> 1:21:10.100
-Santa doesn't usually
drop the ball.

1:21:10.166 --> 1:21:12.934
-It's just too bad
Taylor's not here.

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.900
We could have all gone
skating together.

1:21:14.967 --> 1:21:15.934
-That's okay.

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:17.033
You and I will.

1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:18.734
But first, we've got
to check out Santa's landing,

1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:20.367
so go get dressed
and grab your coat.

1:21:20.433 --> 1:21:22.033
-I left it upstairs.

1:21:22.100 --> 1:21:23.400
I'll be right back.

1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:38.367
-Taylor?
-Hi.

1:21:38.433 --> 1:21:39.533
-What are you doing here?

1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:40.734
-I'm sorry...

1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:42.333
I hope
I'm not interrupting anything.

1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:43.734
-I thought you'd left.

1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:45.100
Come in.

1:21:45.166 --> 1:21:47.600
-Well, I was on my way
last night,

1:21:47.667 --> 1:21:50.033
but then I realized
I forgot something.

1:21:50.100 --> 1:21:52.000
-What did you forget?

1:21:52.066 --> 1:21:54.367
-I have been traveling so long,

1:21:54.433 --> 1:21:55.900
I forgot what home felt like.

1:21:57.734 --> 1:21:59.667
And since I found it
this week...

1:21:59.734 --> 1:22:00.967
why would I want to leave?

1:22:01.033 --> 1:22:02.967
-But what about your job?

1:22:03.033 --> 1:22:06.633
-My firm got the downtown
redevelopment project.

1:22:06.700 --> 1:22:07.834
The Mayor confirmed it.

1:22:07.900 --> 1:22:11.100
Which means Linda will be
needing someone to head it up.

1:22:11.166 --> 1:22:13.633
It'll be the biggest job
I've ever done.

1:22:13.700 --> 1:22:15.834
-But what about Paris?

1:22:15.900 --> 1:22:16.934
Your dream?

1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:20.133
-I've got everything
I've ever dreamed of right here.

1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:21.967
-So you're staying?

1:22:23.834 --> 1:22:24.767
-I am.

1:22:24.834 --> 1:22:25.667
-Great!

1:22:25.734 --> 1:22:27.266
Then you can come
to my grand opening.

1:22:27.333 --> 1:22:28.667
Or "re-opening," I should say.

1:22:28.734 --> 1:22:30.734
-Excuse me?

1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:32.266
-"Ray's Bakery"
is having a grand re-opening--

1:22:32.333 --> 1:22:34.967
as "Ray and Adam's Bakery".

1:22:35.033 --> 1:22:36.633
I'll be handling
the speciality pastries only.

1:22:36.700 --> 1:22:38.467
It wouldn't have happened
with you.

1:22:38.533 --> 1:22:39.633
-Are you kidding?

1:22:40.667 --> 1:22:42.133
Adam, that's great!

1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:44.233
This calls for a celebration!

1:22:44.300 --> 1:22:45.800
-Then you'd better
get your skates,

1:22:45.867 --> 1:22:46.900
because in this house,

1:22:46.967 --> 1:22:49.767
every Christmas Day
after we go to Santa's Landing,

1:22:49.834 --> 1:22:50.900
we hit the ice.

1:22:50.967 --> 1:22:52.734
But before we go this year...

1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:54.333
I think there's
another tradition

1:22:54.400 --> 1:22:55.400
we should start.

1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:57.400
-And what's that?

1:23:22.066 --> 1:23:23.200
-Merry Christmas.

1:23:24.633 --> 1:23:25.967
-Merry Christmas.

1:23:26.033 --> 1:23:27.133
Dad, who are you talking to?

1:23:29.033 --> 1:23:30.567
-Taylor, you're here?

1:23:30.633 --> 1:23:32.900
-Yes, I'm here.

1:23:32.967 --> 1:23:34.767
And I couldn't be happier.

1:23:35.767 --> 1:23:36.834
Now...

1:23:36.900 --> 1:23:38.667
How about we go check out

1:23:38.734 --> 1:23:40.500
those new skates
I see under the tree?

1:23:47.266 --> 1:23:48.934
-Look, Taylor.

1:23:51.467 --> 1:23:53.667
-Oh...

1:23:53.734 --> 1:23:55.166
Merry Christmas.
