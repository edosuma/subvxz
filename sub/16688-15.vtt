00:11.040 --> 00:15.460
Rawls:
A few months ago, you folks
were scrawny, weak, confused,

00:15.560 --> 00:19.620
drifting aimlessly in space ââ
utterly useless.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.380
Until the Space Tree
graciously took you in.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.820
Was it a mistake?

00:24.920 --> 00:28.500
Only time will tell.

00:28.600 --> 00:32.380
And now those worthless, scrawny
cadets stand before me

00:32.480 --> 00:35.540
as moderately serviceable
Space Tree Rangers.

00:35.640 --> 00:39.060
And, today, you'll graduate
the Spark Initiative

00:39.160 --> 00:42.940
and soon be on your way
to terraform your first planet.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.660
I've already sent
the coordinates

00:44.760 --> 00:46.540
into your dome's
navigational computer

00:46.640 --> 00:49.760
along with your
personal fighter ships.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.660
Today is graduation day!

00:55.760 --> 00:59.020
There will be a ceremony tonight
with light refreshments,

00:59.120 --> 01:00.780
compliments of the Space Tree.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.920
Hope to see you there.
( Cheering )

01:03.040 --> 01:04.140
Ooh!
Ooh!

01:04.240 --> 01:06.260
Graduation!
Graduation!

01:06.360 --> 01:08.360
Wow, one minute
I'm graduating high school,

01:08.200 --> 01:09.540
and now
I'm graduating space.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.020
Take that, Dad!

01:11.120 --> 01:14.340
HmâHm! I don't think "light
refreshments" are gonna cut it.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.420
Comet Stop!
Comet Stop!

01:16.520 --> 01:18.660
Dude, should we get
Moon Cheddar and Onion

01:18.760 --> 01:20.420
or Milky Way
Mesquite Barbecue?

01:20.520 --> 01:22.140
What about
Super Nova Nacho?

01:22.240 --> 01:23.420
Eh, I'll just
get 'em all.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.520
It's not a party
unless you have chips

01:24.960 --> 01:27.020
that taste
like three different things!

01:27.120 --> 01:29.040
Space Tree Guard: Come on, man!
Hurry up with the change!

01:29.120 --> 01:32.740
Sorry, bro, my boss makes me
count back all the change.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.840
Well, my boss will freak out
if we're late

01:34.600 --> 01:36.600
for the attack
on the Space Tree,

01:35.960 --> 01:36.780
so hurry up!

01:36.880 --> 01:38.880
( Both gasp )

01:40.280 --> 01:42.280
( Rumbling )

01:54.080 --> 01:54.980
Sir!

01:55.080 --> 01:57.540
What's taking so long?

01:57.640 --> 01:59.640
IâI got your
Cherry Space Splushee,

01:59.040 --> 02:01.040
just as you requested.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.080
But this guy
is taking too long

02:01.520 --> 02:03.520
to give me my change!

02:04.320 --> 02:07.420
( Slurps )

02:07.520 --> 02:08.340
( Lip smacks )

02:08.440 --> 02:10.180
Keep the change.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.380
( Laughs )

02:11.480 --> 02:13.480
( Screams )

02:15.760 --> 02:18.580
Heh heh! Bad show.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.980
Jolly bad show!

02:21.080 --> 02:23.900
( Laughs )

02:24.000 --> 02:26.460
And he looked just like Pops,
but evil.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.560
Yeah,
like an opposite Pops!

02:27.760 --> 02:29.760
AntiâPops!
AntiâPops!

02:28.720 --> 02:29.700
Jinx.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.100
( Gasps )
He who will erase us.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.540
Attention, Space Tree,
this is your Captain speaking.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.260
<i>There's been a change of plans!</i>

02:36.360 --> 02:39.100
<i>You're all graduated, effective</i>
<i>immediately ââ Congrats!</i>

02:39.200 --> 02:41.660
<i>Your first mission as rangers</i>
<i>starts now!</i>

02:41.760 --> 02:43.800
<i>Leave the Space Tree and</i>
<i>get to your rendezvous points</i>

02:43.880 --> 02:45.020
<i>as soon as possible!</i>

02:45.120 --> 02:47.020
Godspeed and good luck!

02:47.120 --> 02:50.140
Sir, an unknown ship just docked
with the Space Tree!

02:50.240 --> 02:51.740
We're too late!

02:51.840 --> 02:53.180
( Alarm blares )

02:53.280 --> 02:55.020
( Gasps )

02:55.120 --> 02:56.300
( Growls )

02:56.400 --> 02:58.400
( Hisses )

03:04.200 --> 03:07.460
( Loud thuds )

03:07.560 --> 03:09.060
( Growling )

03:09.160 --> 03:10.500
Protect Pops!

03:10.600 --> 03:12.420
Make sure he gets
off the Space Tree!

03:12.520 --> 03:13.660
Pops?
What?!
Huh?!
Why?!

03:13.760 --> 03:15.140
Why me?

03:15.240 --> 03:16.420
No time to explain,

03:16.520 --> 03:18.660
just go!

03:18.760 --> 03:20.760
Everybody, come on!

03:22.240 --> 03:23.140
( Grunting )

03:23.240 --> 03:25.240
No! ( Screams )

03:28.280 --> 03:30.740
I'm so confused!
What's going on?!

03:30.840 --> 03:32.860
Yeah, why's Pops
so special?

03:32.960 --> 03:34.660
Oh, I didn't ask
for this!

03:34.760 --> 03:36.820
Why does everyone
on the Space Tree

03:36.920 --> 03:39.140
have to suffer
on my account?

03:39.240 --> 03:40.580
We'll figure it out
later, Pops.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.020
Let's just do what Rawls said
and get you out of here!

03:43.120 --> 03:45.120
There's a ship in the hanger
we can take.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.620
Sorry, sir, there's no sign
of Pops anywhere.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.180
Where is he?

03:53.280 --> 03:54.980
I told you ââ

03:55.080 --> 03:57.080
I don't know!

03:58.800 --> 04:00.740
( Screams )

04:00.840 --> 04:01.780
All right!

04:01.880 --> 04:04.100
He's ââ
he's on his way!

04:04.200 --> 04:06.860
( Grunts )

04:06.960 --> 04:08.180
You lie.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.460
No, no!

04:09.560 --> 04:11.100
He'll be here
in two minutes.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.620
That's like
a thousand pushâups!
( Scoffs )

04:13.720 --> 04:15.900
A thousand pushâups
in two minutes?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.100
Impossible!

04:17.200 --> 04:18.540
Watch me.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.660
Hup! One, two, three,
four, five.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.580
One handed!

04:21.680 --> 04:23.340
Clapping!
Double clapping!

04:23.440 --> 04:24.300
Fingertips!

04:24.400 --> 04:25.220
Fingertip!

04:25.320 --> 04:26.340
Aztec pushâups!

04:26.440 --> 04:27.740
Triple dip pushâups!

04:27.840 --> 04:29.340
Toeâtoeâtoe pushâups!

04:29.440 --> 04:30.420
Riding pushâups!

04:30.520 --> 04:31.820
Should I
take him out, sir?

04:31.920 --> 04:35.200
No, no. I want to see
how this ends.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.620
There's the ship,
and it's not alone.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.460
This is so boring!

04:43.560 --> 04:46.600
Oh, hush up! Keep an eye out
for the one with the big head.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.620
( Hisses )

04:49.720 --> 04:52.020
( Snarling
indistinctly )

04:52.120 --> 04:53.980
Wow, is that
Super Nova Nacho?

04:54.080 --> 04:55.860
You holding out
on us, Jeff?

04:55.960 --> 04:59.040
( Snarling indistinctly )
Come on, Jeff.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.780
You know we don't speak
Lizarkian.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.880
( All grunt )

05:02.320 --> 05:04.320
Mordecai: Come on!
Let's get out of here!

05:03.880 --> 05:04.900
I'm not going!

05:05.000 --> 05:07.300
Come on, Pops!
We gotta go!

05:07.400 --> 05:09.660
We can't
just abandon everyone!

05:09.760 --> 05:11.460
I'm going back
to save them.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.360
It's what a real
Space Tree Ranger would do!

05:16.720 --> 05:18.140
Both: HmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHm

05:18.240 --> 05:19.740
I've got an idea.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.020
Huh! Barrel roll!

05:21.120 --> 05:22.220
Huh! Toe touch!

05:22.320 --> 05:23.860
Huh! Somersault!

05:23.960 --> 05:25.960
( Growls )
Enough!

05:26.800 --> 05:30.060
If someone doesn't bring me Pops
right now,

05:30.160 --> 05:35.140
you can say farewell to
your Space Tree and yourselves!

05:35.240 --> 05:37.240
Sir, look!

05:38.080 --> 05:39.060
( Chuckles )

05:39.160 --> 05:40.620
You're too late.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.360
Guards, get to your ships!
We cannot lose them!

05:55.800 --> 05:57.540
( Growls )

05:57.640 --> 06:00.780
I told you to get Pops
off the Space Tree!

06:00.880 --> 06:02.580
We couldn't
leave you behind!

06:02.680 --> 06:05.340
It's not
the Space Tree Ranger way.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.420
Hmm.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.100
That's very noble
of you, Pops.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.620
Stupid, but noble.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.100
You're a true Ranger.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.500
It's a shame we have
to cut the graduation short,

06:13.600 --> 06:16.620
but you have no idea
what danger lies ahead of you.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.380
Everybody,
we don't have much time!

06:18.480 --> 06:21.000
Get to your domes and warp out
of here as fast as you can!

06:25.360 --> 06:27.060
Follow us!

06:27.160 --> 06:28.340
There's a guard ahead!

06:28.440 --> 06:31.100
Don't worry, I got this.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.300
Oh!

06:33.400 --> 06:35.400
( Growls )

06:37.640 --> 06:38.900
( Screams )

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Keep running!

06:48.280 --> 06:50.060
No, no, no, no.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.020
No, no, no!

06:53.120 --> 06:54.380
What should we do
now, sir?

06:54.480 --> 06:55.940
Destroy them all!

06:56.040 --> 06:57.380
But leave Pops to me.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.500
( Gasps ) The dome room door
is closing!

07:00.600 --> 07:03.140
Not on my watch!

07:03.240 --> 07:05.300
( Grunts )

07:05.400 --> 07:07.580
Cadets, move!

07:07.680 --> 07:09.780
( Groaning )

07:09.880 --> 07:12.220
Come on, Rawls ââ
let's get out of here!

07:12.320 --> 07:14.940
You guys go.
I'm staying here!

07:15.040 --> 07:16.180
Rawls, no!

07:16.280 --> 07:18.280
Just go!

07:23.240 --> 07:26.160
Whooâya! Oh!

07:32.880 --> 07:34.060
( Beeping )

07:34.160 --> 07:36.060
<i>Warp drive activated!</i>

07:36.160 --> 07:38.180
<i>One minute and counting.</i>

07:38.280 --> 07:40.260
Sureshot,
give us your status!

07:40.360 --> 07:42.360
We're right behind you,
Benson!

07:53.760 --> 07:55.760
( All grunt )

07:57.720 --> 08:00.340
Benson, warp out of here now!
We'll hold them off!

08:00.440 --> 08:02.440
Brace yourselves!

08:04.840 --> 08:06.840
( Growls )

08:07.360 --> 08:10.860
Aah!
Who are these guys?!

08:10.960 --> 08:11.860
( All grunts )

08:11.960 --> 08:13.960
Sureshot,
what happened?

08:13.000 --> 08:13.820
Sureshot?!

08:13.920 --> 08:16.820
Sureshot: <i>Need backup!</i>

08:16.920 --> 08:17.700
HmâHmâHm!
HmâHmâHm!

08:17.800 --> 08:19.800
We got this.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.440
( Screams )

08:24.440 --> 08:26.260
I can't shake 'em!

08:26.360 --> 08:28.300
Ha ha ha!

08:28.400 --> 08:29.820
What the...?!

08:29.920 --> 08:30.940
How 'bout some of this?!

08:31.040 --> 08:33.040
HmâHmâHmâHmâHm!

08:35.720 --> 08:37.840
Let's take
that dweeb out!

08:44.240 --> 08:45.220
( Panting )

08:45.320 --> 08:46.460
Mordecai, help!

08:46.560 --> 08:48.560
( Both Laughing )

08:50.480 --> 08:52.480
In yo face!

08:54.040 --> 08:55.780
Whoa!
Whoa!

08:55.880 --> 08:57.880
( Gasps )
( Gasps )

08:59.280 --> 09:01.460
( Chuckles )

09:01.560 --> 09:03.840
This ends now!

09:06.480 --> 09:07.700
( Beeps )

09:07.800 --> 09:09.800
They've locked onto the dome
with the tractor beam.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.860
Warp us, Benson!

09:15.960 --> 09:17.960
I can't.
The controls are disabled!

09:18.880 --> 09:20.580
Sureshot: You two
get back to the dome!

09:20.680 --> 09:21.740
We'll take it
from here.

09:21.840 --> 09:22.900
No, we're not leaving you!

09:23.000 --> 09:23.980
Just do it!

09:24.080 --> 09:26.080
We'll meet up
with you guys later.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.580
But you could die!

09:26.680 --> 09:30.340
Hey, there's nothing more sure
than death.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.340
Ugh, don't be so dramatic!
We'll disable the tractor beam.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.440
Mordecai, Rigby,
just go!

09:39.080 --> 09:41.240
<i>30 seconds to warp speed.</i>

09:45.120 --> 09:47.120
( Alarm blaring )
( Both grunt )

09:47.600 --> 09:49.780
( Alarm continues )

09:49.880 --> 09:52.520
So long, Pops.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.940
<i>Ship ammo depleted.</i>
We're out of ammo!

09:59.040 --> 10:00.060
I'm not out of ammo!

10:00.160 --> 10:01.380
Yeah, but with your aim,

10:01.480 --> 10:03.460
you don't have a chance,
Sureshot!

10:03.560 --> 10:06.060
That's my name,
don't wear it out.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.220
( Beeps )

10:08.320 --> 10:10.720
Sureshot, no!

10:26.560 --> 10:28.820

10:28.920 --> 10:30.920
<i>Warp speed engaged.</i>
