Previously on...
<i>Suits</i>

00:01.167 --> 00:03.469
113 female employees

00:03.537 --> 00:05.037
across all 22 divisions.

00:05.105 --> 00:06.572
You know what they have
in common?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.908
All denied promotions due
to the fact that they're women.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.810
How often does Louis
ask you out?

00:11.878 --> 00:14.013
- Every single day.
- There are laws

00:14.080 --> 00:15.981
to protect you from
sexual harassment, you know.

00:16.049 --> 00:17.416
- What are you doing here?
- Delivering champagne.

00:17.484 --> 00:19.818
I see you can afford it,
since the money

00:19.886 --> 00:21.420
you've been stealing
from our clients

00:21.488 --> 00:23.255
hasn't been going to
your wife's cancer treatments.

00:23.323 --> 00:24.623
Hey, Monica,
how's it going?

00:24.691 --> 00:26.358
What the hell
are you doing?

00:26.426 --> 00:27.860
Trying to get Monica Eton
to file

00:27.928 --> 00:30.162
a sexual harassment suit
against Daniel Hardman?

00:30.230 --> 00:32.665
I know you think you're trying
to help me, but drop it.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.533
- Did Mike pull it off?
- Yep.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.669
- He suspect you were in on it?
- Nope.

00:36.736 --> 00:38.571
Sign
this confidentiality agreement.

00:38.638 --> 00:39.972
I'll waive my claim.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.674
One-time offer,
take it or leave it.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.375
I decided to farm out
the case.

00:43.443 --> 00:47.479
Let me guess.
Daniel Hardman.

00:49.516 --> 00:51.984
Please state your name
for the record.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.485
Sloane Moseley.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.688
And what is your position
at Folsom Foods?

00:55.755 --> 00:58.157
This was all established
during my client's first

00:58.224 --> 01:00.259
and second deposition.
I'm sorry.

01:00.327 --> 01:01.627
I'm just getting up
to speed.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.162
I like to establish
my own facts.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.197
- Or manufacture them.
- Excuse me?

01:05.265 --> 01:08.233
Let's show opposing counsel
some respect.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.735
Both:
[Whispering] Douchebag.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.371
Regional Vice President
of Marketing and Research.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.540
And how many female executives
work alongside you?

01:14.608 --> 01:15.908
- Three.
- Making a total

01:15.976 --> 01:18.310
of four in a department of nine.
Is there a question?

01:18.378 --> 01:19.678
Yes.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.914
What is the ratio
of men to women senior partners

01:21.982 --> 01:23.515
at Pearson Hardman?

01:23.583 --> 01:26.051
What? She has no knowledge
of that.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.353
Then I direct the question
to you.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.587
And I have the answer,

01:28.655 --> 01:30.089
but it's not relevant
to this case.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.824
What do you mean?
Jessica Pearson's hiring

01:31.891 --> 01:34.126
and firing practices are
directly relevant to the case.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.495
If the next question
isn't regarding Folsom Foods,

01:36.563 --> 01:38.797
this deposition's over.

01:38.865 --> 01:41.533
Folsom Foods?

01:41.601 --> 01:43.268
Ah.
[Laughs]

01:43.336 --> 01:46.071
So sorry.
As you know, I just took over

01:46.139 --> 01:48.741
45 different cases.
I get confused.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.442
I thought we were deposing
Pearson Hardman today.

01:50.510 --> 01:53.345
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:53.413 --> 01:55.381
Oh, my God.
Did--

01:55.448 --> 01:58.117
did I forget to give you
the subpoena?

01:58.184 --> 02:00.052
Pearson Hardman is being sued
for wrongful termination

02:00.120 --> 02:02.955
in the amount of $10 million.
You have been served.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.457
Wrongful termination?
You're lucky you're not in jail.

02:05.525 --> 02:08.926
It's not on his behalf.
It's on Monica Eton's.

02:08.995 --> 02:10.395
I actually got the idea
from you.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.797
Excuse me?

02:11.865 --> 02:15.134
What this firm did to
that woman was unconscionable.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.336
You piece of shit.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.571
Monica Eton deserved
to get fired.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.273
Huh.
The eight women I'm gonna stack

02:21.341 --> 02:23.175
the jury with might disagree
with that.

02:23.243 --> 02:24.810
Not once they learn
she was sleeping with you

02:24.878 --> 02:26.378
while you were embezzling
from this firm.

02:26.446 --> 02:28.614
And how, exactly,
are they going to learn that?

02:28.682 --> 02:31.016
One of the three people
in this room is gonna tell them.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.418
I'm guessing
it won't be you.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.286
I'm afraid it won't be
one of you either.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.587
You gonna kill us?

02:35.655 --> 02:37.489
Oh, I won't need to.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.317
You're bound
by the confidentiality agreement

02:39.325 --> 02:42.361
Jessica signed
the night I left.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.498
"All knowledge of any activity
of Daniel Hardman--"

02:46.566 --> 02:47.733
I know
what it goddamn says.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.702
You signed it so quickly,
I wasn't sure.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.170
Fine.

02:51.237 --> 02:52.738
I know a shakedown
when I see one.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.640
What do you want?
It's not what I want.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.774
It's what Monica wants.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.376
And what is that?

02:57.444 --> 02:59.611
Payback.
You see, when Mike Ross

02:59.679 --> 03:02.781
brought that trumped-up suit
to her, she was very upset.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.809
It brought back the memory
of what you did to her.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.118
I didn't do shit
to her.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.586
That wasn't
how she saw it.

03:07.654 --> 03:08.987
Yet you didn't lift a finger
to help her.

03:09.055 --> 03:10.923
I wanted to
at the time.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.092
But I couldn't very well attack
my own firm, now could I?

03:13.159 --> 03:15.360
- Never stopped you before.
- Touche.

03:15.428 --> 03:16.762
But you can't mention
that either.

03:16.830 --> 03:17.930
We're done.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.198
Harvey, will you escort

03:19.265 --> 03:20.733
this piece of filth
out of the building,

03:20.800 --> 03:24.136
make sure he doesn't commit
any crimes on the way out?

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:34.080 --> 03:35.280
Oh, by the way,
Mike Ross,

03:35.348 --> 03:37.916
virtuoso job drafting
that complaint.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.284
All I had to do was search

03:39.352 --> 03:41.820
and replace "Daniel Hardman"
with "anonymous."

03:41.888 --> 03:43.956
Almost as virtuoso
as the job he did

03:44.023 --> 03:48.894
convincing you Lawrence Kemp
signed that affidavit.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.963
Must stick
in your craw...

03:51.030 --> 03:53.065
Having to walk by my name
day after day.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.500
Oh, we'll get to it.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.834
First we had to turn
your old office

03:55.902 --> 03:57.336
into the new conference room.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.204
When Jessica and I
engineered our coup,

03:59.272 --> 04:00.906
she had that sign down
within minutes.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.841
Schmidt, Gordon, van Dyke.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.043
Jessica wanted it down
the second you were gone.

04:05.111 --> 04:07.646
I told her
it was too soon.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.381
No.

04:09.449 --> 04:12.251
You asked her to be name
partner, and she said "no."

04:12.318 --> 04:14.086
And do you know why?

04:14.154 --> 04:18.023
Because deep in her heart,
she doesn't trust you.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.225
She trusted me
to kick your ass.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.060
Twice.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.863
[Elevator dings]
Maybe.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.901
But I saw
that look back there.

04:28.968 --> 04:32.137
She didn't tell you about
the confidentiality agreement,

04:32.205 --> 04:34.039
did she?

What the hell
were you thinking?

05:12.922 --> 05:15.190
I don't want to discuss this,
Harvey.

05:15.257 --> 05:17.192
He gave up his partnership,
his money,

05:17.259 --> 05:19.127
and his voting rights.
It was a good deal.

05:19.195 --> 05:20.428
I did it,
and it's done.

05:20.496 --> 05:22.297
And now it's come back
to bite us in the ass.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.364
We have to settle.

05:23.432 --> 05:25.133
I am not settling.

05:25.201 --> 05:26.935
Our backs
are against the wall,

05:27.002 --> 05:28.937
and we're gonna drain
our resources on a case

05:29.004 --> 05:31.239
that we can't win
just because you boxed us in?

05:31.307 --> 05:33.141
It was
a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

05:33.209 --> 05:34.909
I had one minute.

05:34.977 --> 05:37.111
I wanted to be done
with the man, so I took it.

05:37.179 --> 05:39.314
You told me
never to make rash decisions,

05:39.381 --> 05:40.582
and then you do this.

05:40.649 --> 05:42.884
I told you,
I didn't have a choice.

05:42.952 --> 05:45.320
Did you have a choice when
you decided to keep it from me?

05:45.387 --> 05:47.288
I didn't think
it would ever come up again.

05:47.356 --> 05:49.891
That is not
a good enough reason.

05:53.329 --> 05:58.166
What did he tell you?

05:58.234 --> 06:01.502
He told me you'd never put
my name on the door.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.805
He told me
you'd come after me someday,

06:03.873 --> 06:07.709
maybe even threaten my family
the same way you threatened his.

06:07.776 --> 06:09.611
A little something you never
bothered to consult me on.

06:09.678 --> 06:10.845
I didn't have to.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.553
You'd have told me
to do whatever it took.

06:12.615 --> 06:14.382
- That's not the point.
- Well, what's the point?

06:14.450 --> 06:16.317
You kept it from me.

06:16.385 --> 06:18.152
I let it go

06:18.220 --> 06:19.954
because I knew he was just
trying to get into my head,

06:20.022 --> 06:23.858
the same way he's trying
to get into your head now.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.360
What's gonna happen
when he deposes you,

06:25.427 --> 06:26.895
and you can't tell
the full story?

06:26.962 --> 06:28.229
I don't know, Harvey.

06:28.297 --> 06:30.198
But I trusted you
to beat him before,

06:30.266 --> 06:34.535
and I'm trusting you
to beat him again now.

06:36.538 --> 06:37.639
[Sighs]

06:37.706 --> 06:39.340
Hey, uh,
do you have a minute?

06:39.408 --> 06:40.608
That's about all I have.
I'm under pressure.

06:40.676 --> 06:42.410
I've got to get this done.
Yeah, I know.

06:42.478 --> 06:45.113
We're all swamped with this
Folsom Foods thing, but, uh,

06:45.180 --> 06:49.751
I need your help with a case
that's a little more...personal.

06:49.818 --> 06:51.085
I am swamped
with Folsom Foods,

06:51.153 --> 06:52.487
but I came in early
to carve out

06:52.554 --> 06:54.589
an hour to work on something
personal of my own.

06:54.657 --> 06:58.893
Hmm, what is it?

06:58.961 --> 07:01.696
Harvard application.

07:01.764 --> 07:04.065
Rachel, that's great.
It's great if I get in,

07:04.133 --> 07:05.733
and I'm not gonna get in
if I don't get this done,

07:05.801 --> 07:07.769
and I'm not gonna get it done
if people keep bothering me.

07:07.836 --> 07:08.957
Do people
keep bothering you?

07:08.971 --> 07:10.171
No.

07:10.239 --> 07:13.474
Okay.
So this is going well then.

07:13.542 --> 07:15.510
Less than
1 out of every 12 people

07:15.577 --> 07:16.711
who applies gets in.

07:16.779 --> 07:18.179
What if I'm not
one of those people?

07:18.213 --> 07:21.950
I don't know, maybe you'll
get in somewhere else.

07:23.819 --> 07:24.953
You're kidding me.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.788
I don't want to have
a fallback.

07:26.855 --> 07:30.291
You mean backup?
A logical plan "B"?

07:30.359 --> 07:32.226
Mike, I've been
half-in, half-out

07:32.294 --> 07:34.762
of committing to this for years.
I'm done with that.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.698
Going to law school
is committing.

07:36.765 --> 07:38.045
I don't want to go
to law school.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.400
I want to go
to Harvard.

07:39.468 --> 07:40.802
Just because your father
went there doesn't mean

07:40.869 --> 07:42.003
you need to go there too.

07:42.071 --> 07:45.873
That's not why.

07:45.941 --> 07:48.076
[Sighs] You want to work
at Pearson Hardman.

07:48.143 --> 07:51.112
And if I don't go there,
then I can't work here.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.448
You need any help?

07:53.515 --> 07:57.919
No, it's okay.
I'm gonna do this on my own.

07:57.987 --> 08:01.189
- Okay. [Clears throat]
- I'm so sorr--

08:01.256 --> 08:02.657
what did you
need help with?

08:02.725 --> 08:06.227
It's okay.
I'm gonna do it on my own.

08:06.295 --> 08:08.329
Donna,
I need your help.

08:08.397 --> 08:11.032
With what?

08:11.100 --> 08:12.600
Hardman.
I want you to convince Harvey

08:12.668 --> 08:14.068
to let me
on the Monica Eton case.

08:14.136 --> 08:15.269
I'm sorry, Louis.
I can't do that.

08:15.337 --> 08:16.738
Donna, come on.

08:16.805 --> 08:19.140
He made me look like a fool.
He did the same thing to me!

08:19.208 --> 08:20.408
Well, I need revenge.

08:20.476 --> 08:21.743
[Exhales sharply]
So do I.

08:21.810 --> 08:23.144
See, then why won't you
ask Harvey for me?

08:23.212 --> 08:25.947
Because Harvey needs
to handle this himself.

08:28.517 --> 08:30.752
So this has nothing to do with
any residual issues you've had

08:30.819 --> 08:32.186
with me
and my past behavior?

08:32.254 --> 08:35.056
No.

08:35.124 --> 08:38.192
Because I never told him.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.361
I never told Harvey
how sorry I was

08:40.429 --> 08:42.296
for trusting someone
that betrayed us all.

08:42.364 --> 08:44.432
- Louis, he knows.
- I mean, that bastard

08:44.500 --> 08:46.367
wouldn't even be here right now
if it wasn't for me.

08:46.435 --> 08:48.002
He'd just be some partner
skulking around,

08:48.070 --> 08:49.504
never having won
if I hadn't voted for him.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.205
Look,
it's gonna be okay.

08:51.273 --> 08:53.241
Success is
the best revenge.

08:53.308 --> 08:56.644
Bullshit.

08:56.712 --> 09:00.148
Revenge is
the best revenge.

09:03.052 --> 09:05.119
- Harvey, where are you going?
It's only 10:30.

09:05.187 --> 09:07.155
- You gonna dock my pay?
- I'm serious.

09:07.222 --> 09:08.556
I've got
some really good stuff here.

09:08.624 --> 09:10.825
First of all, Hardman's
non-compete is still in effect.

09:10.893 --> 09:13.461
He can't even be practicing law.
In New York.

09:13.529 --> 09:15.263
Where the hell
do you think we are?

09:15.330 --> 09:17.965
He's working out of Jersey.
He's got an office of one.

09:18.033 --> 09:19.801
Bank account, car service,
cell phone.

09:19.868 --> 09:21.035
I mean, all of them
are based in New York.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.236
We can fight it.

09:22.304 --> 09:25.373
- That's exactly what he wants.
- What?

09:25.441 --> 09:28.042
Articles of incorporation,
office, landline,

09:28.110 --> 09:29.977
company car,
all in Jersey.

09:30.045 --> 09:32.513
He's constructed it,
so we'd be tempted to fight him,

09:32.581 --> 09:34.142
waste our time and resources,
then lose.

09:34.149 --> 09:35.249
Okay, fine.
Then what we need to do next

09:35.317 --> 09:36.317
is dig into Monica Eton.
I think--

09:36.385 --> 09:37.585
Hold on.

09:37.653 --> 09:39.454
You're on Folsom Foods,
not Monica Eton.

09:39.521 --> 09:41.489
Harvey, they're using
the exact lawsuit I wrote,

09:41.557 --> 09:43.391
word for word.
I know how to fight it.

09:43.459 --> 09:44.792
Did he tell you that?

09:44.860 --> 09:47.028
No, he didn't need to.
I read it.

09:47.096 --> 09:48.496
I mean, he didn't just get
the idea from me,

09:48.564 --> 09:50.031
he got the whole execution
from me.

09:50.099 --> 09:53.334
He's doing that because
he's trying to get in your head.

09:53.402 --> 09:55.603
This isn't your fault.
We did this together.

09:55.671 --> 09:57.038
Then let me
help you fix it.

09:57.106 --> 09:58.739
I'm sorry.
Those papers can't help me,

09:58.807 --> 10:00.441
and neither can you.

- Rachel.

10:10.586 --> 10:11.552
Yes, yes.
I know who you are.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.121
I just wasn't expecting you.

10:13.188 --> 10:15.823
Um, I don't live here.

You must be here to see my dad.
Yes, I am.

- Jets?
- Giants.

Man after my own heart.
[Sports announcer in background]

10:29.138 --> 10:31.439
Why is it the defensive line
is always packed with a bunch

10:31.507 --> 10:34.108
of big, strong, black guys
and the offensive line

10:34.176 --> 10:36.611
packed
with big, fat, white guys?

10:36.678 --> 10:38.479
Well, I don't know.
But looking at you,

10:38.547 --> 10:41.582
you've got a foot
in both camps.

10:41.650 --> 10:43.251
I guess you're not here
to ask a favor.

10:43.318 --> 10:45.286
No.
I'm here to do you a favor.

10:48.991 --> 10:50.358
You do not know who you are
in bed with, Robert.

10:50.425 --> 10:52.660
I went to law school
with the man.

10:52.728 --> 10:54.061
Well, he might have been
a prince back then,

10:54.129 --> 10:55.363
but he sure as hell
isn't one now.

10:55.430 --> 10:56.998
Then enlighten me.

10:57.065 --> 10:58.599
Because from what I know,

10:58.667 --> 11:00.668
he left the firm
to take care of his wife,

11:00.736 --> 11:02.403
and when he came back,
you forced him out.

11:02.471 --> 11:05.239
[Chuckles] That's nowhere
near the full story.

11:05.307 --> 11:09.877
What else is there?
I'm listening.

11:09.945 --> 11:11.646
You signed
a confidentiality agreement.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.916
I am precluded from speaking
on that topic.

11:14.983 --> 11:16.450
Then I'm afraid
you're precluded

11:16.518 --> 11:17.952
from convincing me
to take him off this case.

11:18.020 --> 11:19.460
- Robert--
- What's it gonna cost you

11:19.521 --> 11:21.255
to violate the agreement?

11:21.323 --> 11:23.958
Give me a number.
Hmm?

it's in the millions.

11:30.299 --> 11:33.167
You said I didn't know the
kind of man I was in bed with?

11:33.235 --> 11:35.937
From the looks of it,
I'm in bed with the kind of man

11:36.004 --> 11:40.708
who's got you
by the balls.

11:54.590 --> 11:56.490
What can I do for you?

11:56.558 --> 11:59.093
I need to talk
hypothetically.

11:59.161 --> 12:01.395
Is this hypothetically
about a suit being brought

12:01.463 --> 12:03.497
by an ex-name partner
against his old firm?

12:03.565 --> 12:05.766
Because, you know I can't talk about
a case that's on my own docket.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.034
Would you prefer
I tell the IRS

12:07.069 --> 12:09.337
about a hypothetical
conversation I had

12:09.404 --> 12:11.672
with an up-and-coming judge
nine years ago?

12:11.740 --> 12:15.042
[Sighs]
Give it to me.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.144
The name partner in question
was the one she had

12:17.212 --> 12:19.914
an affair with while he was
embezzling money from the firm.

12:19.982 --> 12:21.515
So bring it up.
Make your case.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.217
We can't.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.152
He got you to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

12:25.220 --> 12:26.520
Yes.

12:26.588 --> 12:28.723
But the spirit of the agreement
was to shield him.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.324
If we had
a sealed hearing,

12:30.392 --> 12:33.194
how would you rule
on tossing the confidentiality?

12:33.262 --> 12:35.596
- I'm afraid you'd lose.
- Why?

12:35.664 --> 12:36.697
If he were the plaintiff,
it'd be one thing,

12:36.765 --> 12:38.165
but he's the attorney.

12:38.233 --> 12:39.967
I can't punish the woman
for her choice of attorney.

12:40.035 --> 12:43.037
What if he doesn't make
that argument?

to feng shui the evil out.

here is gonna testify.

to hurt you.

13:55.825 --> 13:57.725
You mean when you planted
that memo and got me fired?

13:57.793 --> 14:00.395
I did
no such thing.

14:00.463 --> 14:01.830
And any implication
otherwise

14:01.897 --> 14:03.631
from within this firm
is actionable.

14:03.699 --> 14:06.167
Yeah, right.
But you never meant to hurt me.

14:06.235 --> 14:08.870
I'd imagine
whoever planted that memo

14:08.938 --> 14:10.672
thought that
you would bring it forward.

And if you had, the only thing
that would have happened

14:12.608 --> 14:14.242
to you is
you would have been scolded.

14:14.310 --> 14:17.645

would have been over.

was she let go?

14:54.683 --> 14:57.051
That was determined
by a variety of factors.

Was one of the factors
that she was having

to a variety of factors.

15:45.534 --> 15:46.601

it wasn't the affair,

15:46.669 --> 15:47.829
and it wasn't
job performance.

15:47.870 --> 15:50.939
So I ask you,
what was it?

15:51.006 --> 15:52.106
Is it
a personal dislike?

15:52.174 --> 15:54.742
Are you jealous
of her?

15:54.810 --> 15:57.879

16:06.755 --> 16:08.156

And since your client can't seem
to find her words today,

16:09.959 --> 16:11.492
I, for one,
can testify that

16:11.560 --> 16:14.896
she was not in a relationship
at the time.

16:14.964 --> 16:16.731
She's always been married
to her job.

16:16.799 --> 16:18.266
And she wants
her female associates

16:18.334 --> 16:19.767
to be equally committed,

16:19.835 --> 16:22.155
so that as soon as they have
anything else in their lives--

16:22.204 --> 16:25.340
in other words, sex--
she cuts 'em loose.

16:27.509 --> 16:29.277

prettier than you,

and of child-bearing age--

and you fired her for it.

He did call you that,
but it's only gonna get worse.

And you should have jumped
to my defense

17:04.946 --> 17:06.114
sooner than you did.

17:06.181 --> 17:08.016
I'm your lawyer,
not your husband.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.385

when I did, we'd be broke.

Look, I told you before,
we need to settle.

17:12.253 --> 17:14.622

we're not settling.

about gender.

17:17.492 --> 17:19.127
- It's not!
- It doesn't matter.

to that man.

Then you're gonna look
like a fool.

17:29.872 --> 17:31.272
That's enough.
[Elevator dings]

17:31.340 --> 17:33.374
You're not calling the shots,
I am.

17:33.442 --> 17:35.677
And whether you think
my call is wrong or not,

17:35.744 --> 17:40.148
it is still my name
on that goddamn wall.

17:40.215 --> 17:42.083
You.

17:53.696 --> 17:55.763
Hey, um, sorry,
I don't want to bother you

17:55.831 --> 17:57.198
if you're still working
on your application,

17:57.266 --> 17:59.634
but I need a favor.

17:59.702 --> 18:02.670
Uh, no, I finished.
What do you need?

18:02.738 --> 18:06.240
I need to see a transcript
of Jessica's deposition.

18:06.308 --> 18:08.309
- That's confidential.
- That's why I need your help.

18:08.377 --> 18:10.011
- Mike--
- Rachel, please?

18:10.079 --> 18:13.915
I need it.

18:17.586 --> 18:20.488
By the way, congratulations
on finishing your application.

18:20.556 --> 18:22.824
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:22.891 --> 18:24.692
Are you looking for anything
in particular?

18:24.760 --> 18:29.030
- No, not exactly.
- Uh-oh.

18:29.098 --> 18:32.900
- Oh, my God.
- It just keeps going.

18:32.968 --> 18:35.870
It's worse
and worse.

18:35.938 --> 18:37.405
She had
to sit through this.

18:37.473 --> 18:39.173
Oh, God.
This is all my fault.

18:39.241 --> 18:41.943
- Wait, Mike--
- No, I-I used you to get

18:42.010 --> 18:43.210
to Monica,
and then I used her,

18:43.245 --> 18:45.079
and now he's taking it out
on Jessica.

18:45.147 --> 18:46.681
Yeah, you couldn't have known
it was gonna lead to this.

18:46.749 --> 18:49.450
- [Sighs]
- It's okay.

18:49.518 --> 18:53.488
No, it isn't.
I need to use this.

18:53.555 --> 18:55.223
Either you print it
or I type it out from memory,

18:55.290 --> 18:58.893
but I have to.
Why?

18:58.961 --> 19:00.228
You said you wanted
to go to Harvard

19:00.295 --> 19:01.896
so that you could work
at Pearson Hardman, right?

19:01.964 --> 19:03.264
Yeah.

19:03.332 --> 19:05.666
Well,
if I don't fix this,

19:05.734 --> 19:07.468
there might not be
a Pearson Hardman.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.376
You can't talk to me.

19:20.444 --> 19:21.611
Actually, I can.

19:21.679 --> 19:23.079
I don't have any equity
in the firm,

19:23.113 --> 19:24.647
and I'm not working
on this case.

19:24.715 --> 19:25.815
You're an interested party,

19:25.883 --> 19:27.417
and you drafted
the original complaint.

19:27.484 --> 19:28.985
Any judge in the world
sides with me.

19:29.053 --> 19:30.720
Listen, Monica.
Monica!

19:30.788 --> 19:31.955
I'm not trying
to set you up.

19:32.022 --> 19:33.156
I'm trying to take
responsibility here.

19:33.223 --> 19:34.524
For what?

19:34.591 --> 19:36.359
For doing exactly
what you just said I did.

19:36.427 --> 19:37.894
For drafting
the original complaint,

19:37.962 --> 19:41.397
starting this whole thing off.
I'm--I'm sorry.

19:41.465 --> 19:43.333
No, no.
The only thing you're sorry

19:43.400 --> 19:45.301
about is your little maneuver
backfired.

19:45.369 --> 19:46.730
Yeah, but it didn't backfire
on me.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.738
It backfired on Jessica.
That's too bad.

19:48.806 --> 19:51.240
That's exactly
what I'm happy about.

19:51.308 --> 19:52.308
What?
Jessica didn't screw you,

19:52.376 --> 19:54.143
Hardman did.

19:54.211 --> 19:56.746
Daniel Hardman didn't show up
in my office to fire me,

19:56.814 --> 19:59.349
without cause, notice,
or a letter of recommendation.

19:59.416 --> 20:01.184
- She had cause.
- Did she?

20:01.251 --> 20:03.219
When I told her I knew nothing
about Daniel's embezzlement,

20:03.287 --> 20:06.322
do you know what she said?
"I don't care."

20:06.390 --> 20:07.991
And then five years later,
she sends you

20:08.058 --> 20:10.059
to turn me against him.
That's just it, she didn't.

20:10.127 --> 20:11.227
Look at that.

20:11.295 --> 20:13.062
The attack dog defends
its owner.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.764
Blame me,
you can even blame Harvey,

20:14.832 --> 20:16.899
but Jessica had nothing
to do with it.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.768
If you think I'm gonna buy
for one second

20:18.836 --> 20:20.570
she wasn't behind you coming
to me with that lawsuit,

20:20.637 --> 20:22.438
you are even more naive
than I was.

20:22.506 --> 20:25.041
Please just look
at what he did to her.

20:25.109 --> 20:27.844
I don't have to
because I don't care.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.594
Monica.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.196
- Louis.
- How are you?

20:47.264 --> 20:48.698
- I'm fine.
- Good.

20:48.766 --> 20:50.733
You know,
I wanted to tell you--

20:50.801 --> 20:52.702
I can't really talk right now,
Louis.

20:52.770 --> 20:54.437
Right, because you've got
the deposition?

20:54.505 --> 20:58.374
- I'm meeting Daniel.
- Daniel.

20:58.442 --> 20:59.675
Okay, well,
it was really--

20:59.743 --> 21:01.611
it was really nice
seeing you.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.514
You too.

21:15.592 --> 21:17.960
- A little busy at the moment.
- Monica Eton, I know.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.308
Look,
Harvey didn't want my help,

21:19.329 --> 21:20.463
but I thought
that maybe you would.

21:20.531 --> 21:21.631
Harvey is right.

21:21.698 --> 21:23.399
I need you
on top of Folsom Foods.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.668
This is
about Folsom Foods.

21:25.736 --> 21:27.203
What do you have?

21:27.271 --> 21:30.440
If you can get Monica to admit
that her affair was with Daniel,

21:30.507 --> 21:32.708
this isn't
about gender anymore.

21:32.776 --> 21:33.810
Because they
were both dismissed.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.244
A man and a woman.

21:35.312 --> 21:37.413
Puts you back in the driver's
seat on Folsom Foods.

21:37.481 --> 21:39.148
Okay, do you have
a line of questioning?

21:39.216 --> 21:42.051
Right here.

21:43.654 --> 21:45.555
You ready?

21:45.622 --> 21:46.823
He is.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.324
I want you to let him
take the lead on this.

21:48.392 --> 21:50.593
- What?
- Not a discussion.

21:50.661 --> 21:51.794
Where are you going?

21:51.862 --> 21:53.596
Oh, I'm not spending
another moment

21:53.664 --> 21:55.994
in the same room
with those people.

22:01.805 --> 22:03.439
Miss Eton--
Him?

22:03.507 --> 22:04.907
You're bringing in
the "B" team?

22:04.975 --> 22:06.509
As you pointed out,

22:06.577 --> 22:08.611
the "B" team drafted
this suit in the first place.

22:08.679 --> 22:11.080
- And ran you out of Dodge.
- Right into Jersey.

22:11.148 --> 22:14.684
Well, if he doesn't do well,
he can always approach my client

22:14.751 --> 22:17.720
outside of her place
of employment, again.

22:19.022 --> 22:20.389
Hmm?

22:20.457 --> 22:21.591
I guess he must
have learned from you

22:21.658 --> 22:23.326
not to always tell dad
what he's up to.

22:23.393 --> 22:24.694
You want to know
what he learned from me?

22:24.761 --> 22:30.333
Not to let some two-time loser
get in his head.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.767
Miss Eton,
there's been a lot of talk

22:31.835 --> 22:33.669
about the affair you had
while at Pearson Hardman.

22:33.737 --> 22:35.805
I have
just one question.

22:35.873 --> 22:37.540
Who was
that affair with?

22:37.608 --> 22:39.442
I never said
I had an affair.

22:39.510 --> 22:41.177
But your lawyer
said you did.

22:41.245 --> 22:42.745
Your people said
it was irrelevant.

22:42.813 --> 22:44.013
I didn't,
and it's not,

22:44.081 --> 22:45.481
and I have a lot of questions
about it.

22:45.549 --> 22:46.916
Which we
won't be answering.

22:46.984 --> 22:49.385
- Well, you'll have to in court.
- We're not in court.

22:49.453 --> 22:51.554
No,
but you are on the record.

22:51.622 --> 22:53.289
But since you don't want
to answer the question,

22:53.357 --> 22:54.924
let me ask you
another question.

22:54.992 --> 22:56.425
If you didn't have
an affair,

22:56.493 --> 22:58.161
then what reason could there
possibly be

22:58.228 --> 23:01.030
for you to be fired?

23:01.098 --> 23:02.331
Because I
was being harassed,

23:02.399 --> 23:03.839
and I made it clear
I didn't like it.

23:03.867 --> 23:04.901
Harassed?
By who?

23:04.968 --> 23:05.902
- Don't answer that.
- Oh, no.

23:05.969 --> 23:07.236
My client is going

23:07.304 --> 23:09.472
to answer the question
that your associate asked,

23:09.540 --> 23:11.340
and we're gonna get some things
on the record, right here.

23:11.408 --> 23:12.608
- No, we're done.
- I was being harassed

23:12.676 --> 23:13.809
by Louis Litt.

23:13.877 --> 23:16.279
What?

23:16.346 --> 23:19.015
Go on, Monica.

23:19.082 --> 23:20.483
He asked me out
repeatedly,

23:20.551 --> 23:23.252
after I rebuffed him
again and again.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.556
He would stare at me, wait at
the elevator outside my office,

23:26.623 --> 23:28.457
the diner,
everywhere.

23:28.525 --> 23:30.560
- Anything else?
- Yes.

23:30.627 --> 23:33.196
He was partner, and I had
to say "no" to him.

23:33.263 --> 23:35.865
And it made me feel disgusting
every single day.

23:35.933 --> 23:37.633
Will people corroborate
your account?

23:37.701 --> 23:39.902
It was common knowledge
within the firm.

23:39.970 --> 23:42.972
Any number of people knew,
including him.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.574
Let the record show
that my client

23:44.641 --> 23:46.108
indicated Harvey Specter.

23:46.176 --> 23:48.844
Monica, I have one more question
for you.

23:48.912 --> 23:51.881
To whom did Jessica tell you
to hand in your resignation?

23:51.949 --> 23:53.249
Louis Litt.

23:53.317 --> 23:55.184
So in conclusion,

23:55.252 --> 23:57.753
you were being
sexually harassed,

23:57.821 --> 24:01.023
it was well-known,
Jessica Pearson dismissed you,

24:01.091 --> 24:04.493
and you were actually told
to hand in your resignation

24:04.561 --> 24:07.363
to the very man
who did the harassing.

24:07.431 --> 24:10.399
Yes.
That statement is entirely true.

24:14.371 --> 24:18.040
Gentlemen?

24:18.108 --> 24:20.710
I get it,
that was your plan,

24:20.777 --> 24:22.845
to blame it on Louis
the whole time.

24:22.913 --> 24:25.414
Monica always was
a good lawyer.

24:25.482 --> 24:28.951
Nothing she said in there
wasn't true.

24:29.019 --> 24:30.386
What's it gonna take
to settle this case?

24:30.454 --> 24:32.355
What ever do you mean?

24:32.422 --> 24:34.857
We break confidentiality,
Monica loses,

24:34.925 --> 24:36.125
you get your $15 million.

24:36.193 --> 24:37.460
Tempting.

24:37.527 --> 24:39.729
But we're not gonna do that,
and you know it.

24:39.796 --> 24:41.931
So you want to settle
with Monica

24:41.999 --> 24:43.332
and get out of your jam.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.701
I want a number, and it better
be less than three.

24:45.769 --> 24:47.036
This isn't about numbers.

24:47.104 --> 24:48.804
It's about responsibility.

24:48.872 --> 24:50.973
Monica wants to see
a jury find Jessica guilty.

24:51.041 --> 24:52.208
Bullshit.

24:52.276 --> 24:55.177
You want to see a jury
find Jessica guilty.

24:55.245 --> 24:58.314
Nope.
I assure you, it is Monica.

24:58.382 --> 24:59.415
I don't really care
whether a jury

24:59.483 --> 25:01.817
finds Jessica guilty
or not.

25:01.885 --> 25:03.152
You just want blood.

25:03.220 --> 25:05.821
- It's already there.
- Because of you.

25:05.889 --> 25:08.257
Huh.
Nonetheless, I smell it.

25:08.325 --> 25:10.993
Allison Holt, Robert Zane
both came after you,

25:11.061 --> 25:14.997
and now you have 45 cases
you can't afford.

25:15.065 --> 25:18.701
So pay me $15 million,
fight Monica, and lose.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.403
Fight Monica and win.

25:20.470 --> 25:22.471
It doesn't matter.

25:22.539 --> 25:23.572
Any way you slice it,

25:23.640 --> 25:26.676
I'm gonna bleed you dry.

25:35.053 --> 25:37.221
[Knock on glass]

25:37.289 --> 25:40.157
They promised a brunette.

25:40.225 --> 25:41.425
Well, I guess there's a few.

25:41.493 --> 25:45.329
I want to talk to you
like a person.

25:47.900 --> 25:50.768
Kenny G?

25:53.739 --> 25:55.406
What's on your mind,
Louis?

25:55.474 --> 25:57.708
I know Donna told me that, uh,
you didn't need my help,

25:57.776 --> 25:59.137
and I know we haven't
really spoken

25:59.144 --> 26:03.147
since you ripped up
my letter of resignation.

26:03.215 --> 26:05.249
But I want to help.

26:05.317 --> 26:06.484
I need to help.

26:06.552 --> 26:08.286
Trust me.
It's not a good idea.

26:08.353 --> 26:12.089
He's using Monica
the same way that he used me.

26:13.692 --> 26:16.994
And no one knows that
better than me.

26:17.062 --> 26:18.829
I know.

26:18.897 --> 26:20.064
If I could just talk
to her outside

26:20.132 --> 26:21.232
the confines of everything,
you know?

26:21.300 --> 26:22.767
If I could--

26:22.834 --> 26:25.403
I just know I can convince her
to drop this case, I know it.

26:25.470 --> 26:26.404
- Louis--
- Harvey, please.

26:26.471 --> 26:28.506
I'm begging you.

26:34.346 --> 26:37.048
What's this?
Just read it.

26:44.723 --> 26:46.891
Mike led
the deposition.

26:46.959 --> 26:49.627
[Laughs]
Starts off bold.

26:49.695 --> 26:50.975
Oh, he shouldn't have
asked that.

26:51.029 --> 26:54.765
That's a rookie move.

26:54.833 --> 26:56.601
What--
what?

27:08.380 --> 27:11.148
"Rebuffed again
and again."

27:13.418 --> 27:17.121
She felt disgusted.

27:17.189 --> 27:18.756
"Common knowledge."
Louis-

27:18.824 --> 27:21.525
She pointed at you.

27:21.593 --> 27:23.273
- That doesn't mean--
- No, no, no, no, no.

27:23.328 --> 27:26.063
You used to tease me
about her.

27:28.133 --> 27:30.234
Remember how I used
to stare at her?

27:30.302 --> 27:32.503
That was teasing.

27:32.571 --> 27:34.672
This is bullshit.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.508
- They're twisting everything.
- They are.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.813
He is.

27:42.881 --> 27:45.716
Drink your drink.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.334
What are you
doing here?

28:03.402 --> 28:05.636
I needed some air.

28:05.704 --> 28:07.271
How'd you know
how to get up here?

28:07.339 --> 28:09.907
- Donna. You?
- Donna.

28:17.349 --> 28:19.950
I lied.

28:20.018 --> 28:22.720
- The essay?
- I couldn't do it.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.389
Just think of it
like a closing argument.

28:24.456 --> 28:26.424
Why should they take you?
Exactly.

28:26.491 --> 28:29.193
Why should they take me?

28:29.261 --> 28:30.327
Why do you want to be
a lawyer?

28:30.395 --> 28:31.996
Just--
don't think, tell me.

28:32.064 --> 28:34.765
- My dad.
- Okay. Why?

28:37.235 --> 28:38.669
Do you remember
when I told you

28:38.737 --> 28:40.438
that, when I was a little girl,
people would just tell him

28:40.505 --> 28:42.773
how smart he was?

28:42.841 --> 28:44.709
Right, it had nothing to do
with him being black or white,

28:44.776 --> 28:47.912
he was just amazing.

28:47.979 --> 28:51.882
And I want
to be amazing too.

28:51.950 --> 28:53.784
You are.

28:53.852 --> 28:55.820
Am I?

28:55.887 --> 28:58.522
Because every time I sit down
at that keyboard, I think,

28:58.590 --> 29:01.192
"I'm a paralegal.
That's all I've ever been.

29:01.259 --> 29:03.594
That's all I'll ever be."

29:03.662 --> 29:06.831
Did I ever tell you
about my interview with Harvey?

29:06.898 --> 29:09.934
No...But I'm assuming
it went well.

29:10.001 --> 29:13.604
He laughed me
out of the room.

29:13.672 --> 29:15.406
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not.

29:15.474 --> 29:17.794
He basically told me I didn't
even belong in the interview.

29:17.809 --> 29:20.778
He actually told me
to leave.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.413
What did you do?

29:22.481 --> 29:23.714
I decided
I didn't give a shit

29:23.782 --> 29:26.584
what the other applicants had
that I didn't.

29:26.651 --> 29:27.818
If I was going
through that door,

29:27.886 --> 29:29.954
he'd have to pick me up
and throw me out.

29:30.021 --> 29:32.923
You must have said
something.

29:32.991 --> 29:35.059
Yeah.

29:35.127 --> 29:36.527
Yeah, I told him
I'd be the best damn lawyer

29:36.595 --> 29:41.065
he'd ever seen.

29:41.133 --> 29:44.268
I wish I could have been
a fly on that wall.

29:44.336 --> 29:45.936
Yeah,
you have no idea.

29:46.004 --> 29:48.239
[Laughs]

29:48.306 --> 29:51.175
[Chuckles]

29:56.748 --> 29:58.616
What the hell
is wrong with you?

29:58.683 --> 29:59.784
Me?

29:59.851 --> 30:00.918
You tried to settle
with Daniel.

30:00.986 --> 30:02.286
You're damn right
I did.

30:02.354 --> 30:04.054
Did you read what happened
in that deposition?

30:04.122 --> 30:05.956
I don't care what happened
in that deposition.

30:06.024 --> 30:08.159
I do.
You're out of control.

30:08.226 --> 30:09.493
What did you
just say to me?

30:09.561 --> 30:10.928
Mike Ross wasn't ready
for this.

30:10.996 --> 30:13.364
- He volunteered.
- He went to see Monica Eton.

30:13.431 --> 30:14.632
You've done the same.

30:14.699 --> 30:17.735
I'm a senior partner,
not an associate.

30:17.803 --> 30:21.806
Me to you,
you to him.

30:21.873 --> 30:25.442
Fine.

30:25.510 --> 30:27.190
You want to know
why he went to see Monica?

30:27.212 --> 30:28.512
I'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

30:28.580 --> 30:30.214
Because he doesn't know
the idea to stir her up

30:30.282 --> 30:32.516
against Daniel was yours
in the first place.

30:32.584 --> 30:34.885
He doesn't need
to know.

30:34.953 --> 30:36.353
So you don't trust him
with that,

30:36.421 --> 30:38.956
but you trust him to go up
against Daniel himself.

30:39.024 --> 30:41.258
He came to me with a way
to put us back in a position

30:41.326 --> 30:42.760
to win Folsom Foods.

30:42.828 --> 30:45.029
Well, it failed.
We're behind on both.

30:45.096 --> 30:46.530
- Excuse me.
- Mike.

30:46.598 --> 30:50.100
I just wanted to apologize
to you both for yesterday.

30:50.168 --> 30:51.569
It was
a good idea,

30:51.636 --> 30:52.937
just didn't have
the right execution.

30:53.004 --> 30:55.606
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying it was a good idea,

30:55.674 --> 31:00.311
but the questions were being
asked of the wrong person.

31:02.981 --> 31:05.282
Three on one.

31:05.350 --> 31:07.751
All for a deposition
of little, old me.

31:07.819 --> 31:10.087
Would you be more comfortable
over there,

31:10.155 --> 31:11.555
where your old desk
used to be?

31:11.623 --> 31:14.191
No need.
We won't be here long.

31:14.259 --> 31:17.328
Our confidentiality agreement
prohibits most questions.

31:17.395 --> 31:19.663
Actually,
it only prohibits disclosures.

31:19.731 --> 31:22.233
We can ask you any question that
any lawyer who hadn't signed

31:22.300 --> 31:24.568
a non-disclosure agreement
could ask.

31:24.636 --> 31:26.170
We just can't
make statements.

31:26.238 --> 31:29.874
I'm sure if you were
to ask Judge Henderson,

31:29.941 --> 31:35.079
say, out by his pool,
he would agree.

31:35.146 --> 31:36.447
There's
no court reporter here.

31:36.514 --> 31:39.850
I thought you might want
to talk off the record.

31:39.918 --> 31:41.485
[Camera powers down]
If you ask me anything

31:41.553 --> 31:43.921
about embezzlement,
I'll deny it.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.222
If you bring
any proof forward,

31:45.290 --> 31:46.824
it's a violation
of our non-disclosure.

31:46.892 --> 31:49.193
That's why we won't be asking
about your embezzlement.

31:49.261 --> 31:51.395
We'll be asking you
about your affair with Monica.

31:51.463 --> 31:52.963
And if you lie
about that,

31:53.031 --> 31:55.332
we won't be the ones who need
to come forward with proof.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.834
Because we found six people
working at the hotel

31:56.902 --> 31:59.036
who are willing
to provide it.

31:59.104 --> 32:00.905
No, you didn't.

32:00.972 --> 32:03.974
Room service,
concierge, housekeeping.

32:04.042 --> 32:05.609
You really should tip better,
Daniel.

32:05.677 --> 32:06.744
Maybe you want
a cigarette?

32:06.811 --> 32:10.748
Remind you of the woman
you cheated on.

32:14.085 --> 32:16.453
[Camera powers on]

32:16.521 --> 32:18.389
Go ahead.
Ask your questions.

32:18.456 --> 32:19.976
Did you have an affair
with Monica Eton

32:20.025 --> 32:21.592
while you were employed
at Pearson Hardman?

32:21.660 --> 32:24.194
Yes, I did.
Any other questions?

32:24.262 --> 32:26.363
I think we're good.

32:26.431 --> 32:29.366
Yep.
You got me to embarrass myself.

32:29.434 --> 32:31.735
But you already did that,
the day you told everyone

32:31.803 --> 32:33.443
in the office
about my affair with Monica.

32:33.471 --> 32:35.272
You and you.

32:35.340 --> 32:37.675
Yeah, I know
what you told Monica

32:37.742 --> 32:39.710
about Jessica
not knowing.

32:39.778 --> 32:41.578
But take a good look.

32:41.646 --> 32:44.915
She was behind it.

32:44.983 --> 32:48.552
Who needs
a cigarette now?

32:48.620 --> 32:50.387
And as far
as my admission goes?

32:50.455 --> 32:51.816
You're still the one
who fired her,

32:51.823 --> 32:53.524
24 hours
after you found out.

32:53.591 --> 32:55.592
That's what a jury's
gonna focus on.

32:55.660 --> 33:00.164
Nobody's gonna care
about what I did.

33:17.182 --> 33:19.416
You piece of shit.

33:19.484 --> 33:21.118
There's the fire
I helped nurture.

33:21.186 --> 33:22.453
You didn't nurture
a goddamn thing.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.754
You don't teach.

33:23.822 --> 33:26.090
You don't inspire.
You don't mentor.

33:26.157 --> 33:27.791
All you do
is betray.

33:27.859 --> 33:29.526
Like you betrayed me
at that last vote.

33:29.594 --> 33:32.262
- How dare you.
- How dare I what?

33:32.330 --> 33:33.998
You were more than happy
to help out

33:34.065 --> 33:35.366
when it served
your purposes.

33:35.433 --> 33:36.867
I voted the way
I did the second I realized

33:36.935 --> 33:37.968
it was all a lie.

33:38.036 --> 33:39.737
And look
how it turned out.

33:39.804 --> 33:41.138
You're a senior partner now.

33:41.206 --> 33:43.507
You're welcome.
You think I give a shit?

33:43.575 --> 33:46.010
I think that's all
you ever cared about.

33:46.077 --> 33:47.778
You know
what I cared about?

33:47.846 --> 33:49.013
Monica.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.315
She was so smart
and so beautiful.

33:51.383 --> 33:52.616
And I knew she was
out of my league,

33:52.684 --> 33:53.751
but I kept trying
because I just thought

33:53.818 --> 33:56.987
if she just got
to know me--

33:59.224 --> 34:01.225
and then I found out
that whole time she was--

34:01.292 --> 34:04.495
- With me.
- Yeah. With you.

34:04.562 --> 34:08.831
Why are you
telling me this?

34:08.900 --> 34:12.235
I want you to know exactly
what it is that you twisted,

34:12.303 --> 34:17.007
so you know exactly what it was
that put me over the edge.

34:17.074 --> 34:18.708
Are you threatening me,
Louis?

34:18.777 --> 34:21.445
Threatening you?
No, I'm telling you.

34:21.513 --> 34:24.715
You ever do anything
to me ever again,

34:24.783 --> 34:29.253
you ever so much as tell me
the incorrect time,

34:29.320 --> 34:31.789
I'll kill you.

34:31.856 --> 34:35.993
I will rip your smug face
off your fat neck,

34:36.061 --> 34:39.563
and I'll kill you.

34:59.352 --> 35:01.119
You here
to depose me again?

35:01.187 --> 35:03.755
Didn't go too well
for you last time.

35:03.823 --> 35:06.358
No, I'm here to say
I'm sorry.

35:06.426 --> 35:09.027
You were right...
about Jessica.

35:10.763 --> 35:13.298
You really didn't know
it was her.

35:13.366 --> 35:15.033
Welcome to the world.

35:15.101 --> 35:16.735
Stings, doesn't it?
Yeah.

35:16.803 --> 35:18.603
It does.

35:18.671 --> 35:20.639
So you came all the way here
just to tell me you're sorry?

35:20.706 --> 35:22.541
No, I didn't.

35:22.608 --> 35:25.210
Jessica was wrong
to fire you,

35:25.278 --> 35:26.945
but she didn't fire you
because you're a woman.

35:27.013 --> 35:28.747
She fired you
because she didn't trust you.

35:28.815 --> 35:30.449
- I know that.
- So then you also know

35:30.516 --> 35:33.151
that keeping this suit alive
is sticking it to her.

35:33.219 --> 35:34.519
That's the whole point.

35:34.587 --> 35:35.787
No, the whole point
is that she's not

35:35.855 --> 35:37.222
the only one
you're sticking it to.

35:37.290 --> 35:39.758
What I said about Louis Litt
is factually accurate.

35:39.826 --> 35:41.359
And if you think I'm gonna drop
the case because of him, I'm--

35:41.427 --> 35:43.128
I'm not talking
about him.

35:43.196 --> 35:45.764
I'm talking about the 113 women
who are suing

35:45.832 --> 35:48.834
Folsom Foods right now
for gender discrimination.

35:48.901 --> 35:52.204
Those cases
are their own thing.

35:52.271 --> 35:54.105
They're being told
they can't get where they want

35:54.173 --> 35:55.872
because they're not
good enough.

35:55.897 --> 35:57.309
That has nothing to do with me.

35:57.310 --> 36:00.011
[Scoffs]
Who's being naive now?

36:00.079 --> 36:01.999
He's using your suit
to drive us into the ground,

36:02.048 --> 36:05.383
and driving us into the ground
means losing these cases.

36:05.451 --> 36:08.019
What do you want?

36:08.087 --> 36:11.656
Just read these files.
Decide for yourself.

36:11.724 --> 36:15.927
These women deserve to be
treated the same way you were?

36:15.995 --> 36:19.531
What makes you think
I would even care?

36:19.599 --> 36:22.334
I'm naive,
remember?

36:34.680 --> 36:36.681
Mike Ross went
to see Monica Eton again.

36:36.749 --> 36:39.017
- At your direction?
- On his own.

36:39.085 --> 36:40.886
Goddamn kid.

36:40.953 --> 36:43.088
He's another you.
Not exactly.

36:43.155 --> 36:46.758
He went to apologize for lying
to her the first time.

36:46.826 --> 36:48.193
- He didn't lie.
- No.

36:48.261 --> 36:50.061
We did.

36:50.129 --> 36:53.031
Like the two of you lied to me
about him being a lawyer?

36:53.099 --> 36:54.432
How about
we call it even?

36:54.500 --> 36:57.569
It's nowhere near even.

36:59.505 --> 37:01.473
- Isn't it?
- What's this?

37:01.541 --> 37:02.707
He got her to settle.

37:02.775 --> 37:06.945
- There wasn't an offer.
- There is now.

37:07.013 --> 37:08.446
This does not
get us off easy.

37:08.514 --> 37:10.115
Hell of a lot less
than $15 million.

37:10.182 --> 37:12.250
- She doesn't deserve a dime.
- Doesn't matter.

37:12.318 --> 37:13.852
I was right
to fire her.

37:13.920 --> 37:18.189
That's not what this is about,
and you know it.

37:25.865 --> 37:30.335
He made me look
like a fool with her then,

37:30.403 --> 37:33.538
and he's made me look
like a fool with her now.

37:33.606 --> 37:35.874
No one cares what he said
in that deposition.

37:35.942 --> 37:38.109
You think I give a shit about
what he said in that deposition?

37:38.177 --> 37:40.211
I meant getting me
to sign that agreement.

37:40.279 --> 37:41.813
You can't win
every move.

37:41.881 --> 37:43.381
I should have
seen it coming.

37:43.449 --> 37:44.983
You made a decision
under the gun.

37:45.051 --> 37:47.252
- I let him put me there.
- We beat him

37:47.320 --> 37:51.690
because you kept your cool
when I wanted to lose mine.

37:51.757 --> 37:54.793
Keep your cool now,
sign this agreement,

37:54.860 --> 37:58.163
and let's beat him again.

38:06.072 --> 38:08.306
You look happy.

38:08.374 --> 38:10.141
So do you.

38:10.209 --> 38:13.845
The pressure's off.
No more essay.

38:13.913 --> 38:16.214
- You finished it.
- I had a breakthrough.

38:16.282 --> 38:19.451
Uhoh.
What was it?

38:19.518 --> 38:20.785
I'm a paralegal.

38:20.853 --> 38:22.754
Rachel, please tell me
that that doesn't--

38:22.822 --> 38:25.023
No, I don't--
I don't mean that in a bad way.

38:25.091 --> 38:26.257
I mean it
in a great way.

38:26.325 --> 38:27.592
Do you know
what the length

38:27.660 --> 38:30.195
of an average corporate lawyer's
career is?

38:30.262 --> 38:31.262
30 years.

38:31.330 --> 38:33.498
Wrong.

38:36.769 --> 38:39.137
- Whoa!
- Because they hate it.

38:39.205 --> 38:40.572
Not me.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.707
I've been here longer than 75%
of our associates,

38:42.775 --> 38:44.275
and I love it.

38:44.343 --> 38:47.112
Which means when you get out,
you won't be disillusioned.

38:47.179 --> 38:49.714
No.
I'll be unleashed.

38:49.782 --> 38:52.017
And that's what I told them
in my essay.

38:52.084 --> 38:53.518
In other words...
You're gonna be

38:53.586 --> 38:55.320
the best damn lawyer
they've ever seen.

38:55.388 --> 38:57.389
- I'm going to Harvard.
- You really are.

38:57.456 --> 39:00.492
[Laughs] Yeah.
Yeah.

39:04.864 --> 39:05.930
What?

39:05.998 --> 39:10.201
Oh, nothing.
It just--just hit me.

39:10.269 --> 39:12.871
You're not gonna
be here anymore.

39:12.938 --> 39:15.206
I mean, you'll--
you know, you'll be there.

39:15.274 --> 39:18.743
Boston.
Cambridge.

39:18.811 --> 39:23.648
I guess I'll just have
to get used to that.

39:23.716 --> 39:26.618
I guess I'll have
to get used to that too.

39:32.725 --> 39:34.559
[Elevator dings]

39:34.627 --> 39:35.827
You going home?

39:35.895 --> 39:37.328
Unless there's
something pressing?

39:37.396 --> 39:38.997
- No, I was just gonna, uh--
- Hey, what happened here?

39:39.065 --> 39:40.298
What are you talking about?

39:40.366 --> 39:43.201
- It's off.
- Looks fine to me.

39:43.269 --> 39:47.972
It isn't.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.642
Wait a second.
Your eye for detail?

39:50.710 --> 39:53.678
One record askew, and I don't
hear the end of it for a week.

39:53.746 --> 39:57.549
You scratched
my Miles Davis.

39:59.585 --> 40:00.752
It was me.

40:00.820 --> 40:02.554
- What were you thinking?
- I was pissed.

40:02.621 --> 40:04.422
- You're so emotional.
- I lost my cool.

40:04.490 --> 40:06.224
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I know.

40:06.292 --> 40:08.927
I shouldn't have
hit Hardman.

40:08.994 --> 40:10.195
- You didn't.
- I did.

40:10.262 --> 40:12.697
- When?
- Right before Jessica's depo.

40:12.765 --> 40:14.766
- Closed fist?
- Open palm.

40:14.834 --> 40:16.568
- Bitch slap!
- Damn straight.

40:16.635 --> 40:17.736
How'd it feel?

40:17.803 --> 40:19.043
Good enough
that I did it again.

40:19.071 --> 40:20.371
[Laughter]

40:20.439 --> 40:22.440
Look at you.
You're beautiful.

40:22.508 --> 40:25.844
You have a date?
As a matter of fact, I do.

40:25.911 --> 40:27.779
Bitter and barren,
my ass.

40:27.847 --> 40:28.980
Someone special?

40:29.048 --> 40:32.350
You never know.
Could be the one.

40:32.418 --> 40:35.420
[Elevator dings]

40:35.488 --> 40:38.890
Oh, and why don't you go ahead
and take that damn name down.

40:46.899 --> 40:50.602
You keep showing up here,
Laura's gonna kick your ass.

40:50.669 --> 40:53.037
Oh, you'd be surprised at
the strength of a jealous woman.

40:53.105 --> 40:56.040
[Laughs]
She has nothing to worry about.

40:56.108 --> 40:57.575
[Chuckles]

40:57.643 --> 40:59.944
Once again, I guess you're
not here to ask for a favor.

41:00.012 --> 41:02.480
You want to know
who Daniel is?

41:02.548 --> 41:06.384
Read his own words.

41:06.452 --> 41:09.487
He's not the first man
to have an affair.

41:09.555 --> 41:11.122
Maybe the first
to turn around and sue

41:11.190 --> 41:13.324
his former colleagues
for his own actions.

41:13.392 --> 41:14.959
[Laughs]
That's all you have?

41:15.027 --> 41:16.327
Tip of the iceberg.

41:16.395 --> 41:19.697
Believe me, he will turn on you
if you let him in.

41:19.765 --> 41:21.833
No one's letting him in.
He's a contractor.

41:21.901 --> 41:23.802
He's not a partner,
he's not of counsel,

41:23.869 --> 41:25.904
he's not an associate.
I'm telling you,

41:25.971 --> 41:28.252
kick him off of Folsom Foods.
Don't let him in your house.

41:28.307 --> 41:30.575
And I just told you,
he's not in my house.

41:30.643 --> 41:33.978
You're in my house.

41:34.046 --> 41:35.880
What if our houses
were the same?

41:35.948 --> 41:39.050
Oh, now.
You're moving pretty fast.

41:39.118 --> 41:41.419
I told you,
my wife's the jealous type.

41:41.487 --> 41:44.022
You offered
a merger once.

41:44.089 --> 41:47.826
Let's settle these cases,
get it done.

41:49.195 --> 41:50.428
You hate him that much?

41:50.496 --> 41:53.064
Yes or no?

41:53.132 --> 41:54.432
Here's the problem.

41:54.500 --> 41:55.767
Merger looked good before,

41:55.835 --> 41:58.136
but now we have you
on the ropes.

41:58.204 --> 42:02.140
So when Pearson whatever
goes under,

42:02.208 --> 42:04.209
we'll pick up the pieces
for free.

42:04.276 --> 42:06.411
You do not have us
on the ropes.

42:06.478 --> 42:08.146
Oh,
you'll get it tomorrow.

42:08.214 --> 42:10.248
We're filing to try
seven different cases

42:10.316 --> 42:13.618
in seven different jurisdictions
all at the same time.

42:13.686 --> 42:15.753
- Rocket docket.
- Yeah.

42:15.821 --> 42:18.456
It was Daniel's idea.

42:18.524 --> 42:21.426
He'll see you
in court.
