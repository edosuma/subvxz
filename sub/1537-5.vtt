[Chuckles]

00:04.121 --> 00:06.622
Oh, you guys are probably
curious about this.

00:06.623 --> 00:07.623
It's no biggie.

00:07.624 --> 00:08.791
My car's in the shop,

00:08.792 --> 00:11.093
so I rode in on
Rosa's motorcycle.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.596
I guess you could say
I'm a gear head now.

00:13.597 --> 00:16.265
He held on to me so tight,
it was like a two-mile Heimlich.

00:16.265 --> 00:19.001
Those things have
no walls on them.

00:19.002 --> 00:21.437
Captain,
why are you sitting at my desk?

00:21.438 --> 00:24.140
Lieutenant Miller from
internal affairs is here.

00:24.141 --> 00:26.342
<i>He's taken over my office.</i>

00:26.343 --> 00:28.844
Apparently, someone has been
leaking classified information

00:28.845 --> 00:29.979
to a criminal syndicate.

00:29.980 --> 00:31.903
The entire squad is
under investigation.

00:31.909 --> 00:33.149
That's crazy.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.418
No one here's a mole.
How can you be so sure?

00:35.419 --> 00:36.485
Because I know
these guys.

00:36.486 --> 00:37.620
I know everything
about them.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.021
Well, you're
a poor police officer

00:39.022 --> 00:40.912
if you don't think people
can surprise you.

00:40.918 --> 00:42.892
Not these people.
Here, watch this.

00:42.893 --> 00:44.527
I know what everyone's
gonna do tonight.

00:44.528 --> 00:47.029
It's thursday,
so Gina's gonna leave early

00:47.030 --> 00:48.664
to rehearse with her
new dance group,

00:48.665 --> 00:49.565
dancy Reagan.

00:49.566 --> 00:50.733
There the first ladies
of movement.

00:50.734 --> 00:53.002
Amy's gonna be
going over her weekly budget.

00:53.514 --> 00:56.305
And Charles will be attending
a "pizza for one" cooking class.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.346

Pepper-alone-I.

00:58.352 --> 01:00.474
And if I run and leap
at Terry,

01:00.480 --> 01:02.684
he will most certainly
catch me in his arms.

Hey, I'm about to sit down
with internal affairs.

I figure that I will
charm them

01:30.395 --> 01:33.431
with a couple of quips
about my own "internal affairs."

01:36.201 --> 01:37.568
I know you're used
to riffing with me,

rarely have my sense of humor.

01:40.605 --> 01:43.725

about this investigation.

If you're wondering
how I'm pulling this off,

01:52.751 --> 01:54.085
I'm thinking about the time
when I was eight

01:54.086 --> 01:56.087
and Don Mattingly
called me a little turd.

- Yes.

02:06.398 --> 02:08.933
I generally prefer
simple nods.

Okay.

02:10.102 --> 02:13.213
Would you, uh, pass me
that hand sanitizer, please?

Yeah.

02:14.973 --> 02:16.133

02:25.050 --> 02:27.084
Get off, damn germs.

02:27.085 --> 02:31.422
So what information
has been leaked and by who?

02:31.423 --> 02:33.057
You don't need to know that.

02:33.058 --> 02:34.425
All you need to know

02:34.426 --> 02:35.660
is that a felony
has been committed

02:35.661 --> 02:36.861
by someone on your squad,

02:36.862 --> 02:38.496
and I'm gonna find out
who did it.

Now... have you ever
taken confidential information

out of this precinct?

No.

that stupid.

I don't like where
this is going.

02:57.315 --> 02:59.450
Well, I also maybe sometimes
bring home case files

02:59.451 --> 03:00.785
to work on them after hours,

03:00.786 --> 03:02.586

about returning them.

investigation?

This precinct's
a disaster.

04:23.702 --> 04:25.770
Maybe that's why
the birds stopped singing.

for the death of your career.

a shred of good news

04:34.079 --> 04:36.026
about your drug
task force?

04:36.027 --> 04:37.696

I can be brief about it.

04:37.697 --> 04:38.970
We have nothing.

has made some busts.

any high-level dealers

soon.

of the word "horrible"

I've been on the force
for 30 years,

15:52.610 --> 15:54.344
and I've never been accused
of impropriety.

15:54.345 --> 15:55.778
Oh, is that a fact?

15:55.779 --> 15:57.547
Because I heard you call
deputy chief Wuntch

15:57.548 --> 15:59.382
by her first name
and after that,

15:59.383 --> 16:01.284
you told her you hoped
she got carried off by crows.

16:01.285 --> 16:02.785
That is gross
insubordination.

16:02.786 --> 16:04.754
Madeline is irrelevant.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.322
Our battles extend
beyond the confines

16:06.323 --> 16:08.458
of NYPD rules.

16:08.459 --> 16:09.626
You're being ridiculous.

16:09.627 --> 16:11.194
Am I? If you're
such a great cop,

16:11.195 --> 16:12.695
how come you didn't know
there was a mole

16:12.696 --> 16:13.696
in your precinct?

16:13.697 --> 16:14.964
That's right...
Because you did.

16:14.965 --> 16:16.399
Because you are the mole,
you mole!

16:16.400 --> 16:17.700
I've heard enough!

16:17.701 --> 16:19.836
Please return
your guest pajamas,

16:19.837 --> 16:21.371
guest toothbrush,
and guest slippers,

16:21.372 --> 16:23.573
and get out of here.

16:23.574 --> 16:25.982
It's time for you
to be suspended.

16:29.998 --> 16:31.732
Peralta, shouldn't you be
suspended by now?

16:31.733 --> 16:33.834
Yes, and I know that you're mad
that I'm here,

16:33.835 --> 16:35.402
but you're about to
get over it,

16:35.403 --> 16:37.137
because I know
who the mole is.

16:37.138 --> 16:38.572
Lieutenant Miller.

16:38.573 --> 16:40.674
I don't think
he's with I.A.B. at all.

16:40.675 --> 16:42.376
I think he's spying
for Wuntch.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.177
Wuntch?
You said it yourself.

16:44.178 --> 16:45.746
Your battles extend
beyond the confines

16:45.747 --> 16:47.180
of NYPD rules.

16:47.181 --> 16:48.749
She wants information
about your task force,

16:48.750 --> 16:52.119
but she can't get access,
so she sent in a spy.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.654
That's why Miller
was skulking around

16:53.655 --> 16:56.323
the file room when I was
supposed to be the only skulker.

16:56.324 --> 16:58.325
That's interesting.
I did notice something odd

16:58.326 --> 17:00.494
when he and Wuntch first met.
She just nodded at him.

17:00.495 --> 17:02.560
She didn't even try
to shake his hand.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.669
She already knew
he was a germaphobe

17:08.670 --> 17:09.935
because they'd met before.

17:09.936 --> 17:11.171
Yes.

17:11.172 --> 17:13.173
Unfortunately,
we don't have any hard proof

17:13.174 --> 17:14.540
that they're working
together.

17:14.541 --> 17:19.579
Well, lucky for you,
proof is my middle name.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.915
And yours is Jared.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.915
Juice box.

17:22.916 --> 17:23.950
Jellyfish.

17:23.951 --> 17:25.915
[Gasps]
Jamiroquai!

17:28.189 --> 17:29.856
Lieutenant Miller.

17:29.857 --> 17:31.091
What do you want,
Peralta?

17:31.092 --> 17:32.381
I wanna play ball.

17:32.387 --> 17:34.394
Clear my name,
and I'll give you information

17:34.395 --> 17:35.662
about captain Holt.

17:35.663 --> 17:38.095
Well, I'm interested.
What kind of information?

17:38.633 --> 17:40.634
It's all on this.

17:40.635 --> 17:41.968
Pretty dope drive, right?

17:41.969 --> 17:43.937
It's a USB
shaped like a gun.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.238
Boink!

17:47.442 --> 17:48.976
All right,
I'll give it to my superiors

17:48.977 --> 17:50.477
and I'll be in contact.

17:50.478 --> 17:52.943
Hey, I know you only wanted
to hang out last night

17:53.448 --> 17:54.748
so you could find out
dirt on me.

17:54.749 --> 17:56.655
What?
Uh-uh.

17:56.661 --> 18:00.242
Look, you don't
have to be worried.

18:00.248 --> 18:03.123
I'll never tell anyone
about you and Charles.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.792
But honestly, it's not
as embarrassing as you think.

18:05.793 --> 18:10.697
It was shocking, but then I got
over it, and it seemed normal.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.867
Except for seeing how hairless
Charles' legs are.

18:13.868 --> 18:15.469
I mean, does he shave them?

18:15.470 --> 18:17.170
No, he wears
really cheap pants

18:17.171 --> 18:20.273
and as far as I can tell,
he's been chafed smooth.

18:20.274 --> 18:21.274
Yikes.

18:21.275 --> 18:22.576
Imagine that
wrapped around you.

18:22.577 --> 18:23.577
Okay.

18:25.513 --> 18:27.414
Okay. I could get in a lot
of trouble for this.

18:27.415 --> 18:31.018
But the big secret
about captain Holt is...

18:31.019 --> 18:34.354
That I have a flair
for the dramatic.

18:34.355 --> 18:35.945
Look behind you,
Madeline.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.761
<i>[Holt clearing throat]
(Jake) We're actually in front of you.</i>

18:40.762 --> 18:43.030
That's my fault... I thought the
layout was gonna be different.

18:43.031 --> 18:44.031
I didn't know how you guys
were gonna be sitting.

18:44.032 --> 18:45.065
I took a chance.

18:45.066 --> 18:46.500
Miller may be
in internal affairs,

18:46.501 --> 18:48.368
but he wasn't here
on official business.

18:48.369 --> 18:50.137
You sent him
to spy on us.

18:50.138 --> 18:52.706
That's a flagrant
ethics violation, Madeline.

18:52.707 --> 18:54.207
And it could sink you.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.590
Fine, you're right.
But you can't prove that.

18:56.676 --> 18:58.612
It's just your word
against mine.

18:58.613 --> 19:02.449
Ooh, actually,
it's your word against you.

19:02.450 --> 19:03.684
Pardon me.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.186
I put a recording device
in this dope drive,

19:06.187 --> 19:08.221
so I got your whole
conversation.

19:08.222 --> 19:09.389
(Holt)
You're going to leave

19:09.390 --> 19:10.957
my precinct
and my task force alone.

19:10.958 --> 19:12.325
Or else...

19:12.326 --> 19:14.061
You're...

19:14.062 --> 19:16.396
Wuntch meat.

19:16.397 --> 19:17.931
You sure you wanna go
with that one?

19:17.932 --> 19:18.999
Absolutely.
It's hilarious.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.233
All right.

19:20.234 --> 19:21.268
Hey.

19:21.269 --> 19:22.969
I'm sorry
about last night.

19:22.970 --> 19:25.005
I let my personal stuff
affect the job.

19:25.006 --> 19:26.006
It's okay.

19:26.007 --> 19:27.074
No, it's not.

19:27.075 --> 19:29.276
This morning,
I did some real police work.

19:29.277 --> 19:30.877
I called
the learning grove.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.612
They never had an
"Ava Watson,"

19:32.613 --> 19:34.114
so I faxed
them a picture.

19:34.115 --> 19:36.717
They identified her
as Rebecca Lubbock.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.386
I pulled her phone records
and...

19:39.387 --> 19:41.922
I think we have some good leads
on a possible supplier.

19:41.923 --> 19:43.512
Wow, nice work.

19:43.598 --> 19:45.125
And hey,
you should never worry

19:45.126 --> 19:46.393
about your kids.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.228
You're the best dad
I know.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.796
Cagney and Lacey
are gonna grow up great.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.531
You think so?
100%.

19:51.532 --> 19:52.899
You're right.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.735
They're gonna be
twin presidents.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.036
They'll either run
as one person

19:56.037 --> 19:58.027
and trick everyone,
or they'll as two

19:58.033 --> 20:01.007
and serve for
16 consecutive years.

20:01.008 --> 20:03.449
It's a damned Dynasty.

20:03.455 --> 20:05.245
Excuse me,
I have an announcement to make.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.948
Can I have everyone's attention,
please.

20:07.949 --> 20:09.955
Charles Boyle and I
had sex.

20:09.961 --> 20:11.318
What the hell?

20:11.319 --> 20:13.042
Gina,
what are you doing?

20:13.048 --> 20:14.121
Amy was right.

20:14.122 --> 20:15.222
People will be shocked,
and then they'll get over it

20:15.223 --> 20:16.754
and we can move on.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.393
At least this way, I get
to control how it gets out.

20:19.394 --> 20:21.528
I'm about to Olivia pope
this sitch.

20:21.529 --> 20:23.096
First off, I would like
to remind you all

20:23.097 --> 20:25.932
about several notable men
from my past.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.473
The rock-climbing backpacker,

20:27.479 --> 20:28.902
<i>the underwear model,</i>

20:28.903 --> 20:30.837
the guy who looked like
Tywin Lannister.

20:30.838 --> 20:31.905
<i>I bring these men
to mind</i>

20:31.906 --> 20:33.707
so you can appreciate
this dalliance

20:33.708 --> 20:36.076
for what it was...
An outlier.

20:36.077 --> 20:37.577
I will now
take questions.

20:37.578 --> 20:38.779
How was the sex?

20:38.780 --> 20:39.846
Gross.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.314
The sex was gross,
or I'm gross?

20:41.315 --> 20:43.316
You're gross.
The sex was adequate.

20:43.317 --> 20:44.718
How many times
did you do it?

20:44.719 --> 20:45.852
16 and 1/3.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.487
Don't ask, can't explain.

20:47.488 --> 20:49.322
I have a question.

20:49.323 --> 20:51.558
Do you have
any regrets?

20:51.559 --> 20:53.999
No.
It was pretty fun.

20:55.830 --> 20:57.297
[Mouths word]

20:57.298 --> 20:59.255
Thank you so much
for coming out today.

20:59.261 --> 21:01.601
Hey, I should've said this
last night,

21:01.602 --> 21:04.571
but your first casual
relationship... nice work!

21:04.572 --> 21:05.806
I know!

21:05.807 --> 21:07.541
I didn't even propose
to her once.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.643
Jake, I'm so sorry
I lied to you.

21:09.644 --> 21:10.911
I mean, I wanted
to tell you so badly.

21:10.912 --> 21:12.846
But I promised Gina
I wouldn't tell anyone.

21:12.847 --> 21:14.381
You kept a promise
to a friend.

21:14.382 --> 21:16.283
That sounds like
the Charles I know.

21:16.284 --> 21:18.952
Just like I know
everyone here.

21:18.953 --> 21:21.321
Yes, you do.
Although, there is something

21:21.322 --> 21:23.723
you didn't know about me.

21:23.724 --> 21:25.792
My middle name...

21:25.793 --> 21:27.961
Is Jacob.

21:27.962 --> 21:29.830
What?
