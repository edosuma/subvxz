00:00.370 --> 00:03.249
On this epic episode of MythBusters...

00:03.250 --> 00:03.930
Go, baby!

00:04.090 --> 00:07.110
...Adam and Jamie go
Newton's cradle crazy...

00:07.170 --> 00:09.710
Even these two and a half inch
balls are making me giggle.

00:09.860 --> 00:12.570
...as they find out if this viral video

00:12.760 --> 00:14.780
is wrecking ball baloney.

00:15.350 --> 00:16.780
From big beginnings

00:17.620 --> 00:19.550
to a colossal conclusion.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.990
It looks beautiful!

00:21.110 --> 00:24.809
But will their mother of all
Newton's cradles really work?

00:24.810 --> 00:26.260
We are just like Newton's cradles.

00:26.261 --> 00:28.079
In three, two, one!

00:28.080 --> 00:30.230
Also toying big machines

00:30.270 --> 00:32.150
are Kari, Grant and Tory,

00:32.980 --> 00:35.290
as they test a cliff hanger of a myth.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.439
I got nightmares like this.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.179
If your car is teetering over a gorge...

00:40.180 --> 00:42.200
With even a breeze that
car is gonna go over.

00:42.330 --> 00:45.539
...can a bird, landing on the hood,

00:45.540 --> 00:46.830
really cause you to totter over the edge?

00:46.831 --> 00:48.790
Don't make any sudden move.

00:51.670 --> 00:53.410
Who are the MythBusters?

00:53.880 --> 00:55.079
Adam Savage...

00:55.080 --> 00:56.380
It's delicious memory.

00:56.580 --> 00:57.820
...and Jamie Hyneman.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.100
When you doubt, C4.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.430
Between them, more than 30 years
of special effects experience.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.730
Together with Tory Belleci...

01:07.220 --> 01:08.310
My name is science.

01:08.690 --> 01:09.780
...Grant Imahara,

01:11.430 --> 01:12.620
and Kari Byron.

01:12.900 --> 01:13.850
This should be fun.

01:14.410 --> 01:16.110
They don't just tell the myth,

01:16.800 --> 01:18.990
they put them to the test.

01:20.015 --> 01:26.015

01:39.240 --> 01:40.490
What are you doing?

01:40.710 --> 01:41.670
An equation.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.550
Go on.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.370
Does one of these plus one of these

01:46.110 --> 01:47.460
equal this?

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.290 --> 02:01.030
and you have got a desktop
toy taken to the max.

02:03.860 --> 02:08.530
But is it really possible to
supersize a Newton's cradle?

02:09.660 --> 02:12.579
Haha, a wrecking ball size Newton's cradle.

02:12.580 --> 02:14.169
That's fantastic.

02:14.170 --> 02:16.100
Ain't it sweet? That is my favorite.

02:16.420 --> 02:17.390
How do you want to proceed?

02:17.820 --> 02:19.770
Well, we all know where
this is gonna end up,

02:19.771 --> 02:22.380
and it is going to be with
full size wrecking balls.

02:22.890 --> 02:24.900
And that's going to be a huge build.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.939
Well, since this is about scaling
the Newton's cradle effect,

02:27.940 --> 02:31.790
there is no need to go stampeding
towards the full run wrecking balls.

02:32.130 --> 02:33.520
Why don't we do it gradually.

02:33.690 --> 02:36.339
You mean incrementally bumping up
the size for our Newton's cradles.

02:36.340 --> 02:39.129
Exactly, and see if we can tease
out any kind of problems,

02:39.130 --> 02:40.810
dealing with the increase in scale.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.010
- That sounds perfect. Let's do it.
- OK.

02:43.970 --> 02:47.160
So after the first of many cheap gags...

02:47.520 --> 02:50.220
You need to stop playing with
your balls and get back to work.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.640
...Adam sets sail on the small scale.

02:53.920 --> 02:58.400
Now that Newton's cradles is effectively
an instant lesson in energy transfer.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.010
And energy transfer is the
soul of this story for

03:01.090 --> 03:03.629
when we bring this up to
full scale wrecking balls,

03:03.630 --> 03:05.989
the biggest problem we could encounter

03:05.990 --> 03:07.068
is that the energy transfer doesn't work,

03:07.069 --> 03:09.110
that when we lift ball
one of the wrecking balls

03:09.230 --> 03:11.410
it does not send ball five

03:11.570 --> 03:13.930
like you would expect a
Newton cradle to work.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.130
So, how are we going to know

03:15.131 --> 03:17.640
how we're doing as we scale
this up incrementally?

03:17.840 --> 03:18.710
This is how.

03:18.790 --> 03:21.280
I will pull ball one up to this block,

03:21.450 --> 03:23.200
which is the exactly same
distance from ball one

03:23.210 --> 03:25.700
as this block is from ball five.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.969
I release ball one, it sends
ball five a certain distance

03:28.970 --> 03:31.220
that I can measure and compare

03:31.370 --> 03:33.210
against the subsequent Newton cradles.

03:33.530 --> 03:36.410
It's a simple but short-lived setup.

03:36.940 --> 03:40.740
So let's see it again in slow motion.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.600
Adam releases ball one

03:42.830 --> 03:46.749
and in a clear demonstration
of this cradle's efficiency,

03:46.750 --> 03:49.520
ball five almost kisses the blue block.

03:49.890 --> 03:50.640
What did you get?

03:50.670 --> 03:53.069
The energy transfer was surprisingly clean.

03:53.070 --> 03:56.930
Ball five traveled 98% of the
distance that ball one did.

03:57.580 --> 04:00.000
- Wow, only 2% loss after one hit.
- Yep.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.359
Why don't we take it up a notch.
Next size up.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.530
Absolutely. Let's do it.

04:04.050 --> 04:08.000
Now, I'm gonna make one of
these with five of these.

04:08.430 --> 04:10.568
Now clearly all I have to do is
attach some strings to this,

04:10.569 --> 04:11.570
but that's no mean feat.

04:11.740 --> 04:14.309
I don't know if you have tried to
drill into a chrome steel bearing,

04:14.310 --> 04:16.470
but I have. It sucks.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.430
And with that complete,
a quick montage later,

04:24.470 --> 04:27.450
and Newton 2.5 is ready to roll.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.000
And roll it does.

04:35.690 --> 04:37.240
It's not easy being me sometimes.

04:38.730 --> 04:40.570
But after a quick re-string...

04:41.450 --> 04:42.350
Shall we try it out?

04:46.260 --> 04:48.660
...it's got Adam dancing with excitement.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.100
Oh, that's cool.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.999
And while both he and Jamie

04:57.000 --> 05:00.820
get particularly pleased at
something a little low key...

05:00.980 --> 05:02.060
- Isn't that nice?
- Uh-huh.

05:02.490 --> 05:05.220
...it's definitely a build to be proud of.

05:05.300 --> 05:06.070
It's funny.

05:06.071 --> 05:08.890
Even these two and a half inch
balls are making me giggle.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.190
I love it.

05:11.260 --> 05:13.570
But in my mind's eye, I'm already seeing

05:13.650 --> 05:16.529
the larger and larger ones that
we're going to be building,

05:16.530 --> 05:19.570
and it's gonna be hilarious.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.430
But before that hilarity,

05:21.590 --> 05:23.560
it is time for scale test two.

05:24.150 --> 05:26.869
Two and a half inch ball Newton cradle

05:26.870 --> 05:28.890
in three, two, one...

05:31.880 --> 05:33.050
Let's check it out on high speed.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.150
Like last time,

05:35.220 --> 05:37.929
Adam releases ball one before measuring

05:37.930 --> 05:39.880
where ball five maxes out,

05:40.160 --> 05:42.440
and the results are very encouraging.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.860
- Come on, come on, come on.
- It's looks like it's gonna touch.

05:45.010 --> 05:48.309
It is three-eighths away, which is 3%,

05:48.310 --> 05:50.340
which means pretty fricking efficient.

05:50.430 --> 05:51.430
The desktop model,

05:51.580 --> 05:53.809
the ball went 98% of the original distance.

05:53.810 --> 05:56.240
This is 97% of the original distance.

05:56.550 --> 05:58.050
It is scaling beautifully.

05:58.430 --> 05:59.839
And what that means

05:59.840 --> 06:05.100
is that going ludicrously large
like the myth may just yet work.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.230
Next up, a cliff hanger of a myth.

06:12.970 --> 06:15.600
All right, so I have a classic
physics meets Hollywood myth.

06:15.620 --> 06:16.570
All right, let's hear it.

06:16.630 --> 06:19.689
The car goes skidding off the road,
and it's about to go over a cliff

06:19.690 --> 06:22.970
when it's saved by stopping
precariously at the edge,

06:23.000 --> 06:24.170
it's perfectly balanced.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.100
But a little bird comes
and lands on the hood,

06:26.600 --> 06:28.410
and the whole car goes
crashing off the cliff.

06:28.450 --> 06:30.830
A little bird causes the
car to go over the cliff?

06:31.020 --> 06:34.140
Look, I am skeptical.
But, you know what, sounds like a good test.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.640
It is a favorite in many a
script writer's handbook.

06:37.870 --> 06:41.420
But if a car comes to a stand still
on the very edge of a cliff,

06:41.640 --> 06:45.320
can an inquisitive bird be
enough to tip the balance?

06:48.330 --> 06:49.630
All right. So obviously we're going to have

06:49.631 --> 06:51.760
to balance a car on the edge of a cliff.

06:51.850 --> 06:53.258
Why don't we build our own cliff?

06:53.259 --> 06:55.290
That way we know it can
hold the weight of the car,

06:55.291 --> 06:57.600
and if it goes over, we won't get killed.

06:57.760 --> 06:58.450
Good idea.

06:58.660 --> 06:59.810
And then for the fun part,

06:59.870 --> 07:01.858
getting a bird to land on the hood,

07:01.859 --> 07:03.620
I don't think that is gonna
be as easy as we think.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.280
No, I think balancing the car
is going to be the easy part.

07:08.470 --> 07:13.030
So, with tipping over a real cliff
ruled out for obvious reasons,...

07:17.150 --> 07:18.440
at the bomb range,

07:18.441 --> 07:20.920
the MythBusters are going
to build their own.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.910
I think we mean business.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.490
We got a lot of work.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.450
Luckily we have the big tools today.

07:28.470 --> 07:29.879
All right, let's do it.

07:29.880 --> 07:30.780
All right, let's move some earth.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.580
What we got here is a front loader.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.130
Big toys for big boys.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.690
This thing is very powerful.
It's got to move a lot of weight.

07:39.780 --> 07:41.298
Let's see what I can break with this.

07:41.299 --> 07:43.640
What are we gonna be doing?
We're going to be moving a lot of earth

07:43.880 --> 07:46.440
to get our slope up to our cliff.

07:46.810 --> 07:48.850
Nothing better like playing
with big machinery.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.970
Although it may look
a little bit precarious,...

07:58.650 --> 08:01.320
the goal here is to build
a solid cliff edge,

08:01.410 --> 08:03.070
courtesy of a shipping container...

08:04.060 --> 08:05.440
Enter one portable cliff.

08:05.540 --> 08:07.950
...which a car can then be balanced on.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.210
It is taking a while.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.898
Well, it took mother nature

08:10.899 --> 08:12.548
like hundreds of thousands of years,

08:12.549 --> 08:14.500
so really, we're right on schedule.

08:16.130 --> 08:17.430
Beyond the cliff edge,

08:17.510 --> 08:19.410
they're making a sloping escape ramp

08:19.630 --> 08:21.959
which should make a survivable descent

08:21.960 --> 08:24.680
when the car tips over
a little more likely.

08:25.140 --> 08:27.779
It may look like we have been
out here all day playing.

08:27.780 --> 08:32.039
I mean, I have been up and down
this ramp probably about 100 times.

08:32.169 --> 08:33.600
But there's a very good reason,

08:33.919 --> 08:36.849
that reason is we're going to be in the car

08:36.850 --> 08:38.999
that goes off the container
and down that ramp.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.890
So we want this thing to be perfect.

08:41.159 --> 08:44.439
And Grant better hope 100 times was enough,

08:44.440 --> 08:47.210
because with the cliff car
delivered and pimped...

08:47.250 --> 08:49.480
Just in case there was any confusion
who was pushing a car off a cliff

08:49.490 --> 08:51.730
out in the middle of a bomb range.

08:52.290 --> 08:55.420
...it is all systems go for
the pre-bird testing:

08:57.150 --> 09:00.180
finding out the precise
balance point of the car.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.710
OK, you guys ready?

09:02.400 --> 09:03.120
No!

09:05.840 --> 09:09.550
Finding the tipping point
in three, two, one...

09:10.450 --> 09:12.390
You're just going to ease forward, right?

09:12.710 --> 09:14.239
Oh, man!

09:14.240 --> 09:18.099
Tory's first task is to carefully
drop the front wheels over the edge.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.180
OK, slow, you are about
to hit the tyre off.

09:21.540 --> 09:22.500
You can make it.

09:23.190 --> 09:24.540
I got nightmares like this.

09:25.820 --> 09:28.740
And once there, the balance
point test can begin.

09:28.870 --> 09:30.740
But it is a delicate operation.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.800
OK, slowly, slowly.

09:33.470 --> 09:34.740
Little less on the accelerator.

09:35.420 --> 09:36.550
Too little throttle

09:36.590 --> 09:37.680
and they won't budge.

09:38.020 --> 09:39.680
Ok, we're not tipping yet.

09:40.030 --> 09:42.179
Too much and they'll flip over the cliff

09:42.180 --> 09:43.920
without finding the tipping point.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.420
We get no more traction on the back wheels.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.500
And that was too much.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.959
Holy crap, that was scary.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.480
It was like one second we were on the edge,

09:59.560 --> 10:01.270
and then boom, we were off.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.050
I think we need to do that again.

10:04.110 --> 10:04.880
I think so.

10:06.750 --> 10:07.750
Good news and bad news.

10:07.830 --> 10:08.980
Our safety ramp worked.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.740
We are able to get the car go off the cliff

10:10.741 --> 10:12.910
and land safely and we didn't die.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.250
The bad news is though,
I hit the gas too hard.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.519
and instead of finding
that teetering point,

10:17.520 --> 10:18.910
we just went off the cliff.

10:19.020 --> 10:22.130
So, we don't know exactly what
that tipping point is yet,

10:22.210 --> 10:24.420
we are gonna do the test
again to find that.

10:24.840 --> 10:25.780
This is going to be fun.

10:26.580 --> 10:29.800
Still to come, bird balance gets bizarre.

10:31.490 --> 10:35.040
But next, wreaking ball
baloney hits a hurdle.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.260
It's potentially very bad.

10:45.530 --> 10:49.540
Is this crazy construction
site's viral video really real?

10:49.720 --> 10:52.090
Or is this myth headed
to the wrecking yard?

10:54.070 --> 10:56.499
Well, so far it's so good.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.290
I love it.

10:57.650 --> 11:01.400
Because scaling up the Newton
cradle with bigger ball bearings

11:01.440 --> 11:02.780
appears to be working.

11:04.190 --> 11:05.630
It is scaling beautifully.

11:06.030 --> 11:08.720
But now it's time to go bigger again.

11:09.180 --> 11:12.230
Next up, we're going to a 6
inch diameter ball bearing.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.960
This is 33 pounds.

11:15.530 --> 11:20.960
And that means that it is 323 times
as massive as these little ones.

11:22.060 --> 11:23.730
Like the two and a half inch version,

11:23.790 --> 11:25.620
it is Adam who's in charge of the build.

11:25.990 --> 11:28.620
Another day, another Newton cradle stand.

11:29.210 --> 11:32.710
From the stand that this time
is more heavily reinforced...

11:33.680 --> 11:34.810
Nice rack.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.050
...to the ball securing system.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.810
Yes, wow that's heavy.

11:41.670 --> 11:45.080
I have been obsessing about this
story ever since I first came across it.

11:45.310 --> 11:47.979
I am finding it difficult to
describe how much fun it is,

11:47.980 --> 11:51.620
so the only thing I could come
up with was to just show you,

11:52.530 --> 11:53.700
the little balls,

11:55.040 --> 11:56.530
bigger balls,

11:58.740 --> 12:00.490
and really big balls.

12:00.650 --> 12:02.080
Need I say anything more?

12:02.450 --> 12:04.090
Actually, yes, Jamie.

12:04.150 --> 12:07.320
How about you give us a count
down to the efficiency test?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.850
Three, two, one!

12:12.140 --> 12:12.838
Nice.

12:12.839 --> 12:13.880
That was a good clean one.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.860
- Shall we check out the high speed?
- Yeah.

12:17.370 --> 12:22.310
Alright Jamie, ball five went to
94.1% of the distance of ball one.

12:22.590 --> 12:24.760
Yeah, that's an additional 3% loss.

12:24.950 --> 12:26.670
I'm still feeling pretty
good about this thing.

12:26.890 --> 12:28.240
Yeah, still working.

12:29.510 --> 12:32.370
So is increasing the mass
causing us a problem?

12:32.930 --> 12:37.470
Well, we are seeing an increase in
losses, the more we scale these balls up.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.530
But here's the thing,
it is not proportional.

12:40.770 --> 12:43.419
These balls are over 200 times the mass

12:43.420 --> 12:45.810
of the original small balls on the toy.

12:46.110 --> 12:49.810
And yet we're only seeing
a total of about 6% loss.

12:49.870 --> 12:50.900
It is not very much.

12:51.090 --> 12:54.090
Although there is drop off
with increasing size,

12:54.170 --> 12:57.880
it is so slight that the bigger
cradles still work as hoped.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.820
And that means full scale
may not be so far fetched,

13:01.990 --> 13:04.789
provided of course that real wrecking balls

13:04.790 --> 13:07.360
perform the same as ball bearings.

13:13.490 --> 13:16.620
To find out if a bird can
tip a car over a cliff,

13:16.710 --> 13:18.649
the MythBusters first need to find

13:18.650 --> 13:20.410
their car's balance point,...

13:23.140 --> 13:25.250
which is proving harder than expected.

13:25.830 --> 13:27.639
Hey, you guys are safe!

13:27.640 --> 13:29.030
We're alive.

13:29.090 --> 13:31.680
Bad news is that was a little
too Thelma and Louise.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.230
So we have to put you back up there.

13:33.550 --> 13:34.930
- Alright.
- Yeah!

13:35.090 --> 13:36.750
I didn't think you would disagree.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.050
After a somewhat epic
but really fun failure,

13:41.230 --> 13:42.930
we decided to change our methods.

13:42.970 --> 13:44.800
We actually put the car back into place,

13:44.801 --> 13:47.640
and now we are going to
inch that car forward.

13:48.110 --> 13:49.690
So, with the car engine off...

13:50.200 --> 13:51.150
OK, we're ready.

13:51.450 --> 13:53.660
Alright, begin the tipping point test.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.150
...the forklift will instead
gently ease it forward.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.430
Okay. Stop, stop. Stop.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.810
But will it have the required control?

14:03.160 --> 14:05.620
Right about five and a half feet.

14:05.730 --> 14:06.600
How does it feel?

14:07.100 --> 14:08.130
There's no tipping.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.930
Okay, give them just
another tiny little nudge.

14:15.740 --> 14:17.320
Well, so much for plan B,

14:17.400 --> 14:18.760
because like plan A,

14:18.820 --> 14:20.440
the cars tip too soon.

14:21.340 --> 14:23.570
And without finding that tipping point,

14:23.680 --> 14:25.370
they can't bring on the birds.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.830
Alright, plan C!

14:28.230 --> 14:30.140
We're actually going to
use straps this time,

14:30.141 --> 14:32.000
so that if we go too far off the edge,

14:32.120 --> 14:35.110
we can pull the car back
to the tipping point.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.830
Hope this one works.

14:37.260 --> 14:39.330
With resets taking too long...

14:39.410 --> 14:42.090
Can't tell you how many times I
get myself into these situations.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.839
...the guys are hoping that
the strap system will let them

14:45.840 --> 14:48.260
find the balance point
a little more quickly.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.830
Give it a little bump,
give me your angry inch.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.540
But as it turns out,

14:53.680 --> 14:57.669
it still takes an entire afternoon
of pushing and shoving...

14:57.670 --> 14:59.819
All right, now pull it
back to five and a half.

14:59.820 --> 15:00.880
I'll tell you when to stop.

15:01.340 --> 15:03.030
...before they think they cracked it.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.880
Grant, we are at the point of no return.

15:06.970 --> 15:09.540
After a lot of tinkering and
a lot of trial and error,

15:09.630 --> 15:12.270
we have found the exact tipping point.

15:12.350 --> 15:14.330
I feel like we're gonna
go over at any second.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.300
I think at this point, with even a
breeze, that car is gonna go over.

15:17.370 --> 15:19.490
Don't make any sudden moves.

15:19.550 --> 15:22.740
So now, when the guys start to
sway and move their weight,

15:23.460 --> 15:24.710
I think they're gonna go over the edge.

15:24.910 --> 15:26.900
Ready? Let's do it together.
One, two, three.

15:31.225 --> 15:32.925
Yes!

15:34.490 --> 15:36.610
Finally, they've hit pay dirt.

15:36.740 --> 15:38.480
Hey, I think we found the teetering point.

15:38.481 --> 15:40.749
Wobbling at the six and a half foot mark,

15:40.750 --> 15:42.610
the car was so finely balanced,

15:42.650 --> 15:44.880
that a slight lean from Grant and Tory

15:44.970 --> 15:46.690
was enough to sent it over the edge.

15:46.691 --> 15:50.110
But could a landing bird
also tip that balance?

15:50.220 --> 15:53.400
Now, it takes a long time to get
the car to that perfect balance point.

15:53.560 --> 15:57.120
But after seeing how easy
the car went over the edge,

15:57.390 --> 15:59.840
I think if a bird would land
on the front end of the car,

15:59.920 --> 16:01.130
we're definitely going over.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.880
Well, in that case,
let's unleash the beast.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.169
Later on MythBusters...

16:07.170 --> 16:10.650
World's largest Newton cradle,
in three, two, one...

16:11.050 --> 16:13.740
- But next...
- Can a bird tip a car off a cliff?

16:14.330 --> 16:15.330
Who knows?

16:20.740 --> 16:22.549
In wrecking ball baloney...

16:22.550 --> 16:23.590
I'm confused.

16:24.620 --> 16:27.990
...Adam and Jamie's shock tests
using giant ball bearings

16:28.130 --> 16:29.080
have been a hit.

16:29.650 --> 16:31.140
I don't get tired about that.

16:31.450 --> 16:34.860
This is what everyone will be
wanting for Christmas this year.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.990
Which means it is time to go full scale,

16:40.180 --> 16:42.290
where the first thing
on their shopping list

16:42.420 --> 16:45.030
is five identical wrecking balls,

16:45.300 --> 16:49.260
which somewhat unexpectedly
turns out to be impossible.

16:49.410 --> 16:51.410
But all is not lost.

16:51.900 --> 16:55.640
There's nobody who has five
identical wrecking balls.

16:55.870 --> 16:57.200
Well, you know what that means.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.180
I think I do.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.580
We're going to have to build our own.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.210
How do you want to do it?

17:01.670 --> 17:03.630
Big steel balls filled with concrete?

17:03.920 --> 17:05.289
That could work.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.960
- Shall we try it in scale first?
- Sure.

17:06.984 --> 17:07.885
All right.

17:08.510 --> 17:12.069
So, our full size wrecking balls need
to be identical for two reasons.

17:12.150 --> 17:14.680
First, that because that's
what you see in the video.

17:14.810 --> 17:16.339
But second, and more importantly,

17:16.339 --> 17:17.490
their mass needs to be identical,

17:17.491 --> 17:20.040
because that gives us the best
energy transfer possible.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.630
Not only their mass but also
their surfaces have to be

17:22.750 --> 17:24.460
as round as we can get them.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.950
So we're gonna make our own.

17:25.970 --> 17:29.770
We're gonna use the building blocks of real
wrecking balls, steel and concrete.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.568
Before we go to full scale,

17:31.569 --> 17:34.500
we're gonna try a scale experiment with the
simplest arrangement that is possible.

17:34.530 --> 17:37.230
A steel sphere filled with concrete.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.420
So, I have sourced some six
inch hollow steel balls.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.620
I'm gonna drill a hole in them

17:43.621 --> 17:46.340
and fill them with ceramicly hard plaster,

17:47.930 --> 17:50.580
that matches the compressive
strength of concrete.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.320
I'm gonna build a Newton
cradle out of that,

17:52.500 --> 17:55.060
and that really ought to give us a
good guidance to the viability

17:55.061 --> 17:57.430
of our concept for the large scale.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.600
And once the fillings hardened,

17:59.770 --> 18:01.620
everything is set to see if they work.

18:01.845 --> 18:03.045
Here we go.

18:05.670 --> 18:07.370
Uh-oh.

18:09.490 --> 18:11.550
Hey Jamie, you'd better come
take a look at this.

18:12.570 --> 18:13.150
What's up?

18:13.840 --> 18:14.660
Check this out.

18:19.260 --> 18:20.590
Doesn't last very long.

18:20.730 --> 18:23.198
Clearly we're gonna have to come up
with something other than

18:23.199 --> 18:25.000
just filling our wrecking
balls with concrete.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.230
Yeah, that's kind of dead.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.160
This is just what I was afraid of.

18:30.161 --> 18:33.989
These mild steel balls are filled with
an ultra hard gypsum based product.

18:33.990 --> 18:37.509
But they're still not passing enough
energy through to do the job we want.

18:37.510 --> 18:38.900
They're absorbing it somehow.

18:40.140 --> 18:42.200
Personally, I'm bumped.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.120
I know when you look at
the high speed shot here,

18:44.580 --> 18:46.350
it looks like the energy
transfer you are expecting

18:46.620 --> 18:47.560
with Newton's cradle is
actually happening...

18:47.940 --> 18:49.860
ball one goes down and ball five comes up.

18:50.150 --> 18:52.110
But here is the thing that makes
a Newton cradle awesome.

18:52.170 --> 18:55.190
The energy transfer continues.
Tick, tick, tick.

18:55.270 --> 18:57.340
What I am getting from this
isn't tick, tick, tick.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.210
It's tick, tick...

18:59.870 --> 19:01.500
and everyone seems to want to go home.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.130
I don't know what we're going to do.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.629
With real wrecking balls unavailable,

19:06.630 --> 19:09.690
and the most simple do it
yourself design falling flat,

19:09.920 --> 19:12.720
what this myth needs is a brainstorm.

19:15.790 --> 19:17.480
So giant Newton cradle.

19:18.030 --> 19:19.000
How do you want to do it?

19:19.360 --> 19:21.790
Well, we've got this problem, right?

19:21.890 --> 19:24.580
This is gonna be probably 20 feet high.

19:24.780 --> 19:27.050
- We can't forge these solid steel.
- Yeah.

19:27.110 --> 19:28.620
There's no way we can...

19:28.800 --> 19:32.019
And yet we can't have just a big sphere

19:32.020 --> 19:33.370
that we fill with something like concrete.

19:34.070 --> 19:36.850
It is a slow start, so
let's speed things up.

19:38.100 --> 19:41.080
Their goal is to design a
wrecking ball standing

19:41.180 --> 19:44.130
that transfers energy better
than their earlier effort.

19:45.270 --> 19:47.260
Jamie gets a bolt from the blue.

19:47.860 --> 19:49.830
Oh, oh, I know.

19:50.010 --> 19:53.590
All you need is a plate to
go right through the middle.

19:53.740 --> 19:55.829
And then we get some metal spheres,

19:55.830 --> 19:57.210
weld them top and bottom,

19:57.260 --> 19:59.390
then fill the rest with
three barn concrete.

19:59.490 --> 20:03.640
Don't they make buoys
that are made of steel?

20:03.700 --> 20:05.300
Yeah, that's the ticket.

20:05.390 --> 20:06.768
Then we get one of those,

20:06.769 --> 20:07.840
we put the plate in the middle,

20:07.841 --> 20:11.079
we end up with something where it is
solid steel transfer from ball to ball.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.190
But no one could look at them and
say that's not a wrecking ball.

20:14.650 --> 20:15.870
Like that.

20:15.970 --> 20:17.110
That is perfect.

20:17.140 --> 20:18.690
I think we've got a plan.

20:18.700 --> 20:19.250
Let's do it.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.130
Eureka, they've cracked it.

20:21.410 --> 20:22.660
But for the rest of us,

20:22.770 --> 20:23.880
here is a graphic.

20:24.620 --> 20:28.320
They're going to take a 28 inch
naval buoy and cut it in half.

20:28.480 --> 20:32.530
Across the center, they'll weld a
three inch thick hardened steel plate

20:32.700 --> 20:35.540
that should be able to transfer
the energy of the swing.

20:36.040 --> 20:39.000
Inside the buoy, they'll
add rebar and concrete,

20:39.190 --> 20:41.480
just like some old-fashioned
wrecking balls.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.490
That leaves two questions.

20:43.690 --> 20:46.090
With five in a row, will it work?

20:46.260 --> 20:48.200
And can they build them?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.220
Well, with the delivery of buoys,

20:51.310 --> 20:53.460
the guys get that ball rolling.

20:53.810 --> 20:55.480
These things are going to get cut in half,

20:55.960 --> 20:57.610
then we're gonna weld the plates,
right down the middle.

21:00.650 --> 21:01.600
This thing is going to be

21:01.601 --> 21:03.390
the center of our wrecking balls.

21:03.520 --> 21:07.150
It's a three-inch thick piece of especially
hardened steel that we have chosen

21:07.280 --> 21:10.600
because it's gonna be the contact
point from ball to ball.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.640
And because it is really hard,

21:12.760 --> 21:16.550
hopefully it's gonna transfer the energy
just like the Newton's cradle does.

21:16.900 --> 21:20.129
We're also gonna weld structural
stuff that we need onto it,

21:20.130 --> 21:21.900
like a bunch of reinforcing bars

21:21.960 --> 21:24.500
and the rest of the space
will be filled with concrete.

21:24.660 --> 21:28.030
It is definitely an
all-hands-on-deck type build.

21:28.390 --> 21:31.120
Even if a couple of those
hands get distracted.

21:39.230 --> 21:41.490
But once Adam and Jamie chime back in,

21:41.630 --> 21:43.300
their fearsome spheres,

21:43.380 --> 21:47.719
the kind of hybrid of real wrecking
balls and giant ball bearings,

21:47.720 --> 21:49.230
take shape fast.

21:51.490 --> 21:53.020
And off we go.

21:53.810 --> 21:56.470
And while the concrete fill
starts chaotically...

21:56.800 --> 22:00.060
Slow down! Stop.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.190
...it is not long before the team...

22:02.480 --> 22:05.040
John, I need you to get the vibrator ready.

22:05.300 --> 22:08.130
...has this part of the build in the can.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.950
Messier than I thought.

22:11.470 --> 22:13.330
Isn't that the title of your autobiography?

22:13.960 --> 22:15.480
Lovely, look at that.

22:15.770 --> 22:19.970
And, after two weeks to cure plus
a quick paint job, they are all set.

22:20.220 --> 22:22.460
But will they actually work?

22:22.920 --> 22:24.230
After a couple weeks' work,

22:24.450 --> 22:27.290
this is either 10,000 pounds of awesome

22:27.760 --> 22:29.560
or 10,000 pounds of failure.

22:29.770 --> 22:31.839
Coming up next on MythBusters...

22:31.840 --> 22:34.070
A wrecking ball size Newton cradle.

22:34.190 --> 22:36.600
But the question is, will it work?

22:43.450 --> 22:47.120
A precariously balanced car
is no laughing matter.

22:47.190 --> 22:50.790
But can a landing bird really
send you over the edge?

22:51.660 --> 22:53.280
So we're back at the bomb range.

22:53.350 --> 22:55.509
Now, it took a really
long time to get our car

22:55.510 --> 22:57.440
perfectly balanced on our cliff.

22:59.620 --> 23:00.568
But now that we've done it,

23:00.569 --> 23:01.880
it is time to bring in some birds.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.459
We have our expert, Jim, coming in

23:05.460 --> 23:07.650
to use progressively
bigger and bigger birds.

23:07.940 --> 23:09.720
Should be really interesting today.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.449
So essentially, this myth
is all about leverage.

23:12.450 --> 23:15.519
Now, imagine that this block is the cliff,

23:15.520 --> 23:17.360
and this break is the car,

23:17.570 --> 23:19.179
and this rock is the bird.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.299
Because of leverage, out here at the edge,

23:22.300 --> 23:24.549
a small bird can land there

23:24.550 --> 23:26.979
and cause the giant car to go over.

23:26.980 --> 23:27.910
Just like this.

23:28.960 --> 23:29.990
That's the theory.

23:30.150 --> 23:32.319
But will bird one, a classic

23:32.320 --> 23:35.010
yet humble pigeon, provide enough leverage?

23:35.880 --> 23:38.400
All right. So now we're going
to start testing with the birds.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.568
But we're going to test it a
little bit differently this time.

23:40.569 --> 23:43.018
We're still going to put the
car on the edge of the cliff

23:43.019 --> 23:45.190
right where it's balancing,
just ready to fall over.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.060
Should have paid more
attention to the signs.

23:47.180 --> 23:48.100
Cliff ahead.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.300
But this time we're going
to tether the car,

23:50.301 --> 23:53.350
so that way if it does go off the
cliff by the weight of the bird,

23:53.440 --> 23:54.748
it doesn't go down the hill.

23:54.749 --> 23:56.670
Because let's face it.
We don't want to hurt these birds.

23:56.750 --> 23:57.808
We don't care about ourselves.

23:57.809 --> 23:58.830
We just don't want to hurt the birds.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.009
With Grant and Tory sitting anxiously

24:02.010 --> 24:04.280
in the hot seats of their balancing car...

24:05.090 --> 24:07.990
All right. This is it. Okay.

24:08.390 --> 24:09.810
Come on, bring to them, birds.

24:10.010 --> 24:12.880
...Jim flips the birds. And...

24:13.230 --> 24:15.460
Okay. The birds are in place.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.980
Yep, and we haven't gone over the edge.

24:18.270 --> 24:20.230
...there's not a hint of tippage.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.889
But to be sure, the guys shoo
the birds down the hood.

24:23.890 --> 24:25.400
Go away. Go away.

24:26.910 --> 24:27.820
- Get out of here.
- Go!

24:28.030 --> 24:29.470
Don't you have a park to poop on?

24:29.640 --> 24:31.740
Because the further they
are from the fulcrum,

24:31.920 --> 24:33.610
the greater the chance of a tip.

24:34.750 --> 24:37.260
Two pigeons, not happening.

24:37.270 --> 24:38.990
Nope, we are not going over the edge.

24:39.340 --> 24:40.710
Ain't that the truth?

24:40.790 --> 24:43.439
The two pounds of pigeon is just not enough

24:43.440 --> 24:46.530
to cause their balanced
car to tilt up and over.

24:46.970 --> 24:47.898
Which means...

24:47.899 --> 24:49.850
I think it is time for a bigger bird!

24:51.380 --> 24:53.840
Okay, so we didn't get
any tipping from pigeons.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.410
So we're going to move on to hawks.

24:55.580 --> 24:57.620
Not only are we going to
get the extra weight,

24:57.690 --> 24:59.840
but also the momentum
of the hawk's landing.

25:00.300 --> 25:02.170
I still don't think it's going to be quite

25:02.171 --> 25:03.480
enough to tip the car.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.080
You guys ready for the birds?

25:05.360 --> 25:07.089
It's time to let the hawks go.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.789
All right, hawk number one ready to deploy.

25:09.790 --> 25:11.290
Murray lands in a hurry...

25:12.590 --> 25:14.850
but there's no wobble to their wheels.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.530
That didn't send us over the edge.

25:16.531 --> 25:18.410
All right, bring out another hawk.

25:19.500 --> 25:22.379
Doubling the mass to almost five pounds

25:22.380 --> 25:24.180
does seem to make a difference...

25:24.610 --> 25:27.129
I can see the hood kind of bobbling there.

25:27.130 --> 25:29.250
...but it is still not enough.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.160
All right, that's two hawks
at the end of the car,

25:32.360 --> 25:34.128
and we have not gone over the edge.

25:34.129 --> 25:35.390
You're not going over.

25:35.391 --> 25:36.800
We did not fall over.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.640
And when two hawks fail...

25:39.410 --> 25:40.960
Got some work to do. You ready?

25:40.990 --> 25:43.160
...it's time to bring in the big guns...

25:43.220 --> 25:45.080
the giant eagle owl.

25:45.970 --> 25:49.140
You know, in many cultures, an
owl is the harbinger of death.

25:49.480 --> 25:50.980
- Thanks a lot.
- Harbinger of death?

25:51.060 --> 25:53.080
Thanks for the encouragement, Jim.

25:53.230 --> 25:55.300
And with those wise words,

25:55.340 --> 25:56.560
it's go time.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.039
All right. Let's see if this owl
will send us over the cliff.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.730
He is big, he's really big.

26:05.890 --> 26:07.349
- We survived!
- We did!

26:07.350 --> 26:08.620
He is at the edge of the car,

26:08.621 --> 26:10.359
and we did not go over the cliff.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.390
Yep, once again, the car's
balance is unaffected,

26:13.510 --> 26:17.300
even with this seven pounder
right at the front of the hood.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.749
Well, if the owl is not going to do it,

26:19.750 --> 26:20.960
I don't know what is.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.980
Grant, for one, is not that surprised.

26:24.870 --> 26:26.450
Ok, so why don't I think this works?

26:27.040 --> 26:28.410
Imagine that you're at a playground,

26:28.411 --> 26:29.910
and you have a perfect seesaw.

26:30.580 --> 26:32.479
Theoretically, if you have a mass,

26:32.480 --> 26:35.839
which is the bird, landing far
enough away from the pivot,

26:35.840 --> 26:38.030
it should be able to move
the seesaw, no problem.

26:38.380 --> 26:39.500
The only problem here

26:39.690 --> 26:40.989
is that this seesaw

26:40.990 --> 26:42.559
weighs 3000 pounds

26:42.560 --> 26:44.680
and it's on a metal pivot.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.139
The bird isn't heavy enough

26:47.140 --> 26:49.790
and it's not landing with enough
force to cause it to move.

26:50.020 --> 26:51.689
In other words, it's going to take

26:51.690 --> 26:54.340
an even bigger bird to tip this car.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.959
And for that, it's back to the shop.

26:56.960 --> 26:57.780
Do you hear that?

26:58.760 --> 26:59.950
That's the call of the wild.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.260
Adam and Jamie's wrecking balls are ready.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.288
Let's move them out.

27:14.289 --> 27:14.920
All right.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.449
Now they just need to be

27:16.450 --> 27:19.850
strung up into the world's
largest Newton's cradle.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.770
This is our location.

27:22.070 --> 27:24.379
It is a dry dock in Vallejo, California,

27:24.380 --> 27:27.300
and we've used it a number of
times before for experiments.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.290
Check this out.

27:32.930 --> 27:35.340
I don't mind saying, I am hyperventilating.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.180
So why this location?

27:37.560 --> 27:40.319
Well, for the wrecking ball scale
version of Newton's cradle,

27:40.320 --> 27:43.469
we need to be able to suspend
the balls at quite a height.

27:43.470 --> 27:46.120
Now, we could do it on top
of a large building,

27:46.420 --> 27:49.670
or we could do it by suspending
them over a big hole,

27:49.980 --> 27:50.790
like this one.

27:51.150 --> 27:52.670
As well as the big hole,

27:52.780 --> 27:56.040
the dry dock also comes
complete with its own cranes.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.040
But unlike the video,

27:58.210 --> 28:01.230
the guys won't be swinging
their balls from them.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.500
Now in the clip, our wrecking
ball Newton cradle

28:03.590 --> 28:07.079
is actually suspended from
five adjacent tower cranes

28:07.080 --> 28:07.890
next to each other.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.390
There's two problems with this picture.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.839
One is, they don't use tower cranes

28:12.840 --> 28:13.930
to swing wrecking balls.

28:14.070 --> 28:16.770
And two, we were never ever going to find

28:16.790 --> 28:19.800
five tower cranes that we could
park right next to each other.

28:19.850 --> 28:23.359
So this I-beam and four
others quite similar to it

28:23.360 --> 28:24.850
are going to be a figurate structure

28:24.851 --> 28:27.980
which we are going to hang our
wrecking ball cradle from.

28:28.060 --> 28:29.650
Just about to weld it in place.

28:32.470 --> 28:34.169
- That's it.
- That was fast.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.100
- Let's get it in the air.
- Yeah.

28:35.270 --> 28:37.609
With the frame secured so that

28:37.610 --> 28:39.290
it juts out over the dry dock,

28:39.370 --> 28:42.450
the guys then need to attach
their wrecking balls to it...

28:43.650 --> 28:45.180
I'm going to go over here.

28:45.750 --> 28:49.070
...which given their combined
weight of over five tons...

28:49.490 --> 28:50.580
Aren't they pretty?

28:50.680 --> 28:53.660
...is something which is
easier said than done.

28:54.110 --> 28:56.208
Given that each of these
balls weighs about a ton,

28:56.209 --> 28:58.188
it's going to be quite a
process to hoist them,

28:58.189 --> 28:59.680
and maneuver them into place.

28:59.710 --> 29:02.360
So I'm going to be on the
ground with a forklift,

29:02.490 --> 29:04.450
and I'm carefully going to cradle them,

29:04.451 --> 29:06.910
and pick them up, and put them in place...

29:06.920 --> 29:07.920
Okay.

29:08.620 --> 29:09.940
How does it look up there?

29:10.070 --> 29:11.390
Looks beautiful!

29:11.610 --> 29:15.860
...while Adam is overhead on a boom
lift, arranging slings and the cables,

29:16.090 --> 29:19.799
we will carefully skooch them
all in so they precisely fit.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.000
Because if this thing is going to work,

29:22.140 --> 29:23.430
that's the way it's gonna have to be.

29:23.610 --> 29:24.750
I think it is good.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.220
Looks perfect.

29:26.470 --> 29:27.850
And once that's sorted,

29:27.970 --> 29:30.070
the guys get on with the finishing touches.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.760
Does that add something to them?

29:31.820 --> 29:32.460
Totally.

29:32.830 --> 29:34.660
Yeah, it makes them pop a little bit, huh?

29:34.700 --> 29:36.379
But some viewers may be wondering

29:36.380 --> 29:38.890
why there's not two strings attached.

29:39.480 --> 29:43.250
Why, oh why, you might be asking, are we
hanging these wrecking balls from single

29:43.430 --> 29:47.000
cables, when every Newton cradle
we have thus far built in this episode

29:47.070 --> 29:49.840
hangs from two cables in a V formation?

29:49.920 --> 29:51.729
That's because this

29:51.730 --> 29:53.620
is the arrangement that we see in the clip.

29:54.340 --> 29:55.638
We are testing the circumstances

29:55.639 --> 29:56.720
of the clip first.

29:57.030 --> 30:00.740
And only if that doesn't work
do we go to two cables.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.680
With the string theory sorted,

30:02.760 --> 30:04.890
everything is finally ready for a test.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.490
All right. You ready?

30:09.510 --> 30:10.590
I have been waiting for this, you know?

30:10.591 --> 30:11.880
I know. Me, too!

30:12.210 --> 30:14.839
World's largest Newton cradle, test no. 1,

30:14.840 --> 30:18.030
in three, two, one!

30:25.170 --> 30:27.570
We had a... a little rig settling there.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.980
Yeah. It wasn't very exciting though.

30:30.410 --> 30:31.880
No, it wasn't.

30:31.950 --> 30:32.950
It was one hit.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.040
- Yeah.
- One-hit wonder.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.180
A one-hit wonder indeed,

30:38.190 --> 30:39.750
and not a good one at that.

30:39.910 --> 30:41.580
But all is not lost.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.210
I don't need this high speed camera

30:43.211 --> 30:44.830
to tell me that that one was,

30:44.970 --> 30:46.520
shall we say, lackluster...?

30:46.990 --> 30:48.268
Where did the energy go?

30:48.269 --> 30:49.580
The middle of every one of these balls

30:49.581 --> 30:51.400
is a big hardened steel plate.

30:51.510 --> 30:54.189
Well, some of the energy was
absorbed by the balls,

30:54.190 --> 30:58.109
but some of it was absorbed by
our framework actually moving.

30:58.110 --> 31:00.869
The amount of force from ball
one hitting ball two moved

31:00.870 --> 31:03.270
our entire multi-thousand pound framework.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.510
So we've secured it.

31:04.610 --> 31:05.600
And we're gonna go again.

31:06.870 --> 31:09.790
With the framework secured to
within an inch of its life,

31:09.870 --> 31:11.750
its onwards and upwards.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.070
Because this time...

31:13.350 --> 31:14.680
I think that's good.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.770
...they're pulling ball one
back as high as it will go,

31:17.940 --> 31:20.459
to try to maximize the energy of the swing.

31:20.460 --> 31:23.730
Single string, maximum pull back

31:23.830 --> 31:27.910
in three, two, one!

31:36.000 --> 31:37.200
That was a hell of a hit.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.530
It was a hell of a hit.

31:38.610 --> 31:41.290
And a very sad, sad story.

31:42.740 --> 31:45.460
They're all just sort of swinging together.

31:46.750 --> 31:48.088
That's kind of a let down.

31:48.089 --> 31:49.280
That is a real let down.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.399
Yeap, despite ball one hitting ball two

31:52.400 --> 31:56.490
with an impact in excess of 150,000 PSI,

31:56.630 --> 31:59.800
there's still no ca-ching to the swing.

32:02.660 --> 32:03.290
Hear that?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.550
That is the sound of failure.

32:10.210 --> 32:11.610
This thing is so awesome!

32:11.611 --> 32:13.140
I wish you could see it!

32:13.480 --> 32:15.649
Unfortunately, all we've got to show for

32:15.650 --> 32:18.359
it is some swinging shiny balls.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.680
They're not tick tick ticking

32:19.681 --> 32:21.690
like the Newton cradle of our dreams.

32:22.540 --> 32:23.240
Sorry.

32:23.620 --> 32:25.170
No need to be sorry, Adam,

32:25.230 --> 32:27.510
because this myth's grand finale

32:27.630 --> 32:29.000
is still to come.

32:36.320 --> 32:39.800
A pigeon cannot cause a
precariously balanced car

32:39.940 --> 32:41.220
to tip over the edge.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.060
But could a much much bigger bird?

32:46.300 --> 32:48.420
All right. Despite what they say
about working with animals,

32:48.421 --> 32:50.220
those birds were really cooperative.

32:50.370 --> 32:53.669
But since we don't have access
to any bigger flying birds,

32:53.670 --> 32:55.520
I think we need to come
up with another plan.

32:55.710 --> 32:58.400
Yeah. And it is starting to get
a little dangerous for these birds.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.340
What if we went with a model helicopter?

33:00.360 --> 33:03.400
We get one that's the same weight
as the biggest flying bird,

33:03.470 --> 33:05.070
and have it land on the front of the car.

33:05.260 --> 33:06.220
That's a great idea.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.280
Not only can we match the mass of the bird,

33:08.350 --> 33:10.288
but we also get the down
force from the rudders,

33:10.289 --> 33:12.198
just like the bird flapping its wings.

33:12.199 --> 33:12.930
Awesome.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.400
Weighing over 20 pounds,

33:16.430 --> 33:19.190
the California condor is majestic,

33:19.230 --> 33:22.750
a far cry from the MythBusters
helicopter stand-in.

33:23.550 --> 33:26.830
But, while it won't win
any prizes for elegance,

33:27.120 --> 33:31.859
what's key is that the condor-copter
weighs the same as the real deal.

33:31.860 --> 33:35.259
So we've slightly altered an RC helicopter,

33:35.260 --> 33:38.630
to emulate the heaviest
flying bird in North America.

33:39.510 --> 33:41.079
Should not only be the same weight,

33:41.080 --> 33:43.809
but also it should
represent its flight path

33:43.810 --> 33:45.270
when it lands on top of the car.

33:45.620 --> 33:46.828
And that flight path's

33:46.829 --> 33:48.760
something that's been studied by Grant.

33:49.450 --> 33:51.219
Now, I found something very interesting

33:51.220 --> 33:52.889
about the way large birds land.

33:52.890 --> 33:55.260
Check out this video of our giant owl.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.419
See how he swoops down

33:57.420 --> 33:59.770
right before he lands, he rears up,

33:59.870 --> 34:01.559
and then lands very softly,

34:01.560 --> 34:04.219
minimizing its landing speed,
minimizing that momentum

34:04.220 --> 34:06.050
that he then parks on the target zone.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.228
And that's exactly what we're
gonna want our helicopter

34:08.230 --> 34:09.590
to do on the hood of the car.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.840
Well, with the boys all buckled up...

34:13.020 --> 34:14.469
All right, time to go to work.

34:14.810 --> 34:17.889
...an expert pilot Wolf Witt
chomping at the bit,

34:20.219 --> 34:23.070
it's time for this myth to lift off.

34:24.639 --> 34:27.248
It is trying to psych us out.

34:27.250 --> 34:28.260
I know...

34:28.300 --> 34:29.340
I know! Here it comes!

34:30.030 --> 34:33.389
The very precise landing
ramp that the heli must adhere to

34:33.489 --> 34:36.489
is making life very
difficult for pilot Wolf.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.600
Get away, condor!

34:40.780 --> 34:43.989
And when the wind kicks up,
things get harder still.

34:48.409 --> 34:49.790
He's playing games with us!

34:50.239 --> 34:51.570
But eventually...

34:54.820 --> 34:56.620
The eagle has landed.

34:56.880 --> 34:57.830
He did it.

34:57.831 --> 34:59.720
He did it, and we didn't go over!

35:00.750 --> 35:01.950
We survive!

35:02.420 --> 35:03.360
Still there.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.298
20 pounds,

35:05.299 --> 35:06.270
just like the condor,

35:06.271 --> 35:08.650
the biggest flying bird in North America,

35:08.710 --> 35:10.200
still didn't tip the car.

35:13.220 --> 35:15.280
So to get that elusive drop off,

35:15.380 --> 35:18.870
the team is finishing up
with some poultry in motion.

35:19.390 --> 35:20.930
We want to see bird-wise what it takes

35:20.931 --> 35:22.690
to get the car to tip off the cliff.

35:22.850 --> 35:25.569
So I spent all morning training 80

35:25.570 --> 35:28.830
of my best hens to land gently
on the hood of that car.

35:29.110 --> 35:30.908
They are going to single file line up

35:30.909 --> 35:32.320
at the front and work their way back

35:32.321 --> 35:33.890
until it finally goes off.

35:35.470 --> 35:36.530
Okay, you guys ready?

35:36.700 --> 35:37.780
All ready!

35:38.410 --> 35:39.300
No laughing.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.860
Each hen weighs a pound and a half.

35:42.820 --> 35:44.910
They just sit and play dead.

35:44.930 --> 35:46.000
It's incredible.

35:46.500 --> 35:49.040
So by keeping tally of
the number on the hood...

35:49.450 --> 35:50.680
How many you got on there?

35:50.810 --> 35:54.210
- Five.
- Oh! Bird down.

35:54.650 --> 35:57.350
...the guys will know how
much weight it would take...

35:57.530 --> 36:00.720
- 22.
- Starting to get a little nervous.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.660
...to unbalance the car.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.460
60!

36:04.900 --> 36:07.919
Can you believe this, 60 game hens!

36:07.920 --> 36:09.569
That's 90 pounds, man.

36:09.570 --> 36:13.289
90 pounds and still we
are hanging on to cliff.

36:13.290 --> 36:16.760
Yet, incredibly, even with
all 80 hens on there...

36:17.030 --> 36:20.110
It is like a small person
standing on the hood.

36:20.290 --> 36:22.130
...the car still doesn't go.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.139
This is getting stupid.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.210
That's totally stupid.

36:25.211 --> 36:28.300
But Tory came prepared
for this eventuality...

36:29.630 --> 36:31.100
I don't like it, I don't like it!

36:31.110 --> 36:33.120
Oh my god! That's crazy.

36:33.340 --> 36:36.940
...and brought a 20 pound robotic turkey

36:37.050 --> 36:40.240
which dances and jigs until...

36:53.920 --> 36:55.230
Oh, my god!

36:55.310 --> 36:56.799
That was crazy!

36:56.800 --> 36:58.130
I wish you could see the trail

36:58.131 --> 37:00.130
of bird destruction behind you.

37:00.450 --> 37:01.848
You have to make it stop.

37:01.849 --> 37:03.090
It is so creepy!

37:03.960 --> 37:04.530
All right.

37:04.531 --> 37:06.550
It is not looking good for this myth.

37:06.590 --> 37:09.010
I know that movie version,
where a tiny little bird just kind of...

37:09.590 --> 37:11.530
lands at the end and the whole thing goes,

37:11.640 --> 37:13.160
looking a little busted to me.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.449
Good news is, we got birds to

37:15.450 --> 37:17.320
get the car to go off the cliff.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.640
The bad news is, it took over 80 birds,

37:19.720 --> 37:21.900
140 pounds to be exact.

37:23.380 --> 37:24.990
And the only way that would happen

37:24.991 --> 37:27.860
is if a pterodactyl were to land
on the front of your car.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.650
And we all know that
that's not gonna happen.

37:29.970 --> 37:33.200
And what that means is this myth is busted.

37:36.250 --> 37:38.570
At least now we know why the
chicken crossed the road,

37:38.850 --> 37:41.090
to get out of the way of the falling car!

37:44.260 --> 37:47.950
The MythBusters giant Newton's
cradle started with a song...

37:48.250 --> 37:50.010
Five homemade wrecking balls,

37:50.020 --> 37:51.770
one huge steel frame,

37:51.830 --> 37:53.430
huge empty dry dock,

37:53.480 --> 37:56.740
and a wrecking ball Newton cradle.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.260
...but ended with a dong.

38:01.570 --> 38:02.790
That was a hell of a hit.

38:03.090 --> 38:05.729
And a very sad, sad story.

38:05.730 --> 38:08.390
But there may be light at
the end of the tunnel.

38:09.950 --> 38:11.090
So check this out.

38:11.340 --> 38:13.090
Even though this is hardened steel,

38:13.091 --> 38:15.899
the areas where the balls
are impacting have become

38:15.900 --> 38:17.409
flattened from the impacts,

38:17.410 --> 38:19.109
and it's not just here,

38:19.110 --> 38:21.040
it's throughout all of the balls,

38:21.080 --> 38:24.620
which means that they're all kind of
squashing like hamburger patties.

38:24.830 --> 38:27.449
The amount of force here is
something on the order of

38:27.450 --> 38:30.419
500,000 times as much as

38:30.420 --> 38:33.200
what's happening with those little
balls on the desktop toy.

38:33.290 --> 38:36.040
So, clearly lack of
energy is not our problem.

38:36.330 --> 38:37.939
Which means the problem may be

38:37.940 --> 38:39.980
the single cable system

38:40.000 --> 38:41.970
causing the balls to lose focus.

38:43.820 --> 38:45.260
That's kind of a let down.

38:45.470 --> 38:48.620
So, having restrung the
balls with an extra cable,

38:48.780 --> 38:49.980
things are looking up.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.520
So, with some preliminary playing

38:52.521 --> 38:56.089
with the five wrecking
balls on the two lines,

38:56.090 --> 38:58.058
Jamie and I are actually seeing somewhat

38:58.059 --> 39:00.040
of a radical improvement in their behavior.

39:01.950 --> 39:03.390
That's a little more positive.

39:04.470 --> 39:06.549
We're actually not just seeing
a tick and then a boom,

39:06.550 --> 39:09.290
we're actually seeing
tick tick, which is...

39:09.850 --> 39:12.440
makes me cautiously optimistic
about this next test.

39:13.260 --> 39:14.759
So, why would two strings per ball

39:14.760 --> 39:16.410
work better than a single string?

39:16.730 --> 39:19.950
Well, the Newton's cradle is all about
efficient energy transfer.

39:19.980 --> 39:23.520
So if any one of these balls
is a little out of line,

39:23.650 --> 39:25.630
that's gonna mess up the efficiency.

39:25.940 --> 39:29.329
The two strings will help keep these
all lined up perfectly,

39:29.330 --> 39:31.679
and hopefully that will improve

39:31.680 --> 39:33.210
what we're seeing from this device.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.880
Well, there's only one way to find out.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.670
Wrecking ball size Newton cradle,

39:38.671 --> 39:41.079
V-formation cabling,

39:41.080 --> 39:44.850
in three, two, one. Go, baby!

39:46.050 --> 39:46.850
Yes!

39:46.870 --> 39:51.160
One, two.

39:51.790 --> 39:54.410
- Three. Four.
- ...ish.

39:56.070 --> 39:58.100
It's another disappointing result.

39:58.300 --> 40:00.750
But at least there was some improvement?

40:01.650 --> 40:02.900
That was a little bit better.

40:02.990 --> 40:06.630
While our single string gave
us a 30% throwout on ball five,

40:06.790 --> 40:11.200
our double string version gave us a 45%
throwout on the same ball.

40:11.600 --> 40:14.259
Now, that's nowhere
near the desktop version

40:14.260 --> 40:15.480
which gave us 98%

40:15.481 --> 40:17.910
and it's nothing like the clip.

40:18.180 --> 40:20.940
But before this balls-up gets concluded,

40:20.970 --> 40:22.850
there's one last thing to try.

40:23.060 --> 40:25.740
Ball one, pulled back to the max.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.680
Two strings, max pull back.

40:29.050 --> 40:32.540
In three, two, one!

40:33.390 --> 40:36.230
It really is now or never. And...

40:40.860 --> 40:41.900
...it's never.

40:41.930 --> 40:43.550
That went quite a ways.

40:44.450 --> 40:46.210
And now it's all done.

40:46.830 --> 40:49.390
So cue one of the MythBusters models,

40:49.700 --> 40:52.020
failure is always an option.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.000
There goes one of our cameras.

40:55.500 --> 40:56.969
As far as we're aware,

40:56.970 --> 40:59.880
this is the largest Newton's
cradle that's ever been built.

40:59.980 --> 41:01.260
And it is a Newton's cradle,

41:01.261 --> 41:04.319
because it is demonstrating
exactly the same

41:04.320 --> 41:07.460
physical properties that
the small one does.

41:07.740 --> 41:09.969
But as we get larger and larger,

41:09.970 --> 41:11.759
it becomes harder and harder to rein in

41:11.760 --> 41:14.359
the physical losses of energy in the system

41:14.360 --> 41:16.689
from the balls to the cables

41:16.690 --> 41:18.220
to the overhead structure.

41:18.370 --> 41:19.910
While it is a Newton's cradle,

41:20.150 --> 41:21.530
it's just never going to be as

41:21.531 --> 41:23.140
perfect as the little ones are.

41:24.410 --> 41:25.650
So where do we stand?

41:26.110 --> 41:28.460
We set out to replicate
what we saw in the clip.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.699
And nobody can say that we didn't give

41:30.700 --> 41:32.580
a wrecking ball size Newton cradle

41:32.710 --> 41:35.220
the best possible chance in succeeding.

41:35.780 --> 41:37.880
But it didn't look anything like the clip.

41:38.150 --> 41:40.360
Nup, this one is totally busted.

41:40.890 --> 41:42.310
Yeah, it's busted.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.589
And it's busted not just because

41:44.590 --> 41:47.710
their best case scenario
balls failed to fire,

41:47.900 --> 41:52.470
but also because the viral
