Please give me the
strength to do Your will.

02:30.655 --> 02:33.475
Give me the strength, dear Lord.

02:50.415 --> 02:51.835
Do it.

02:51.885 --> 02:53.435
Do it.

02:53.485 --> 02:55.605
Shoot her.

02:58.525 --> 03:00.635
Shoot her.

03:05.525 --> 03:06.915
Come on, man, do it.

03:14.135 --> 03:16.385
Help me do this.

03:16.435 --> 03:17.755
No.

03:33.585 --> 03:36.205
What kind of pussy can't pull the trigger?

04:32.645 --> 04:37.645
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:42.755 --> 04:46.015
So we have confirmation from
all the local media outlets

04:46.065 --> 04:48.485
and a few nationals, including
MSNBC, who wants to do...

04:48.535 --> 04:51.285
Sounds great. Here, check this out.

04:51.335 --> 04:52.785
See that?

04:52.835 --> 04:55.025
Not quite 360, but that's
how it feels, right?

04:55.075 --> 04:57.495
Wow, that's amazing.

04:57.545 --> 05:00.195
Anne, you don't seem excited.

05:00.245 --> 05:03.125
I'm very excited.

05:03.175 --> 05:04.965
That's from one EB camera.

05:05.015 --> 05:09.165
Nathan, can we talk about the bee?

05:09.215 --> 05:11.405
I thought the bee decision was made.

05:11.455 --> 05:14.035
I'm suggesting we revisit it.

05:14.085 --> 05:17.515
I... I don't think we should
have the bee at the pour.

05:17.565 --> 05:18.875
We tested Brooks EB,

05:18.925 --> 05:21.645
and the response was
overwhelmingly positive.

05:21.695 --> 05:23.185
People like bees.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.385
I like bees.

05:24.435 --> 05:26.855
I like their dance language.

05:26.905 --> 05:28.185
Could you imagine if I
had one of these cameras

05:28.235 --> 05:30.425
in the middle of some swarming bees?

05:30.475 --> 05:32.195
I like bees too,

05:32.245 --> 05:35.525
I just don't see what they have
to do with Brooks Innovations.

05:35.575 --> 05:39.935
Well, what did Ronald McDonald
have to do with hamburgers?

05:39.985 --> 05:42.565
This decision was made
and approved a month ago.

05:42.615 --> 05:44.035
No need to get sensitive.

05:44.085 --> 05:46.235
I'm sorry, am I being sensitive

05:46.285 --> 05:47.435
when I disagree with you,

05:47.485 --> 05:49.545
or is it just when I speak at all?

05:49.595 --> 05:51.645
You know, Brooks Innovation is
kind of like a bee, isn't it?

05:51.695 --> 05:53.415
I mean, if everybody
in the world's a flower,

05:53.465 --> 05:54.885
we're the bees.

05:54.935 --> 05:56.285
We collect the nectar,
take it back to the hive,

05:56.335 --> 05:57.915
and make honey,

05:57.965 --> 06:01.055
and we pollinate along the
way, help the world, like bees.

06:01.105 --> 06:02.685
- So the bee's in?
- The bee's in.

06:02.735 --> 06:06.095
You want to see the dance?

06:06.145 --> 06:07.565
No, thank you.

06:07.615 --> 06:08.965
I want a dozen of those set up

06:09.015 --> 06:12.135
around the whole site
here on time lapse mode.

06:18.255 --> 06:19.805
Are you okay?

06:19.855 --> 06:22.005
I'm just tired of Guy's sabotage.

06:22.055 --> 06:26.345
I don't need his shit,
especially after this morning.

06:26.395 --> 06:27.785
Why? What happened this morning?

06:27.835 --> 06:30.445
Someone is stalking me.

06:30.495 --> 06:32.355
Oh, God.

06:33.805 --> 06:35.655
Did you call the police?

06:35.705 --> 06:37.595
I'm not 100% sure.

06:37.645 --> 06:40.955
I just... I saw a big
man in a hoodie, but...

06:41.005 --> 06:43.925
I felt like he was gonna come after me.

06:43.975 --> 06:46.165
You didn't see who he was?

06:46.215 --> 06:48.935
No. No idea.

06:48.985 --> 06:51.635
Anyway, congrats on the bee.

06:51.685 --> 06:52.935
That's a win.

06:52.985 --> 06:55.705
Okay, I'll see you at the pool.

06:57.425 --> 06:59.815
So you gonna tell me
why you're so happy, man?

06:59.865 --> 07:02.615
'Cause honestly, I don't
see a difference, man.

07:02.665 --> 07:03.945
Y'all made that Brooks deal...

07:03.995 --> 07:06.085
it was, like, what, over a year ago, man?

07:06.135 --> 07:07.985
Had the press conference and everything.

07:08.035 --> 07:09.725
Come on, come on, Jackie. It's like this.

07:09.775 --> 07:11.325
You remember Terrell
talking about he was engaged?

07:11.375 --> 07:12.825
- Yeah.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:12.875 --> 07:13.995
Why you got to bring
my name up in this, man?

07:14.045 --> 07:15.625
Look, I'm making a point.

07:15.675 --> 07:17.425
- So make it with your own name.
- Man, relax.

07:17.475 --> 07:18.965
I'm not about to say anything
that's news to anybody here.

07:19.015 --> 07:20.395
You got a smart girl, and got engaged,

07:20.445 --> 07:21.635
and bought a ring, right?

07:21.685 --> 07:23.735
Nigga put 50% down on Cancun, too.

07:23.785 --> 07:25.075
He didn't get that back, either.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.375
- And he didn't get married.
- Right.

07:26.425 --> 07:27.845
See what I mean?

07:27.895 --> 07:29.805
That press conference last
year was getting engaged.

07:29.855 --> 07:32.045
And concrete pour? That's getting married.

07:32.095 --> 07:33.915
Okay, look, I didn't
lose that honeymoon money.

07:33.965 --> 07:36.745
I went to Mexico, and
I had me some señoritas.

07:36.795 --> 07:39.315
Boy, I had me a time. Shit.

07:39.365 --> 07:40.985
Them señoritas probably
cost more than the ring.

07:41.035 --> 07:42.755
- Right, right, right.
- You know, you feel that?

07:42.805 --> 07:45.655
The best 50 pesos I spent. Shit.

07:45.705 --> 07:47.765
Hey, where's Papa D?

07:47.815 --> 07:49.365
He said he don't need a haircut.

07:49.415 --> 07:50.725
You serious?

07:50.775 --> 07:52.035
Never known that man to go to a party

07:52.085 --> 07:53.565
without a shave and a fresh cut.

07:53.615 --> 07:55.365
Well, he's not coming to the pour.

07:55.415 --> 07:56.865
Why not?

07:56.915 --> 07:59.375
I guess he found out what
happened with Goldstein.

07:59.425 --> 08:01.875
He what? How?

08:01.925 --> 08:03.745
I guess I told him.

08:06.295 --> 08:08.245
Come on, man, let me get
this line straight, bro.

08:08.295 --> 08:09.885
We're gonna need to pour some concrete

08:09.935 --> 08:11.245
on the back of your head.

08:23.215 --> 08:24.795
Thought you weren't going to work today.

08:24.845 --> 08:26.365
I didn't.

08:26.415 --> 08:30.235
- But you needed your briefcase?
- Yeah.

08:30.285 --> 08:32.505
Open it.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.304
No.

08:34.355 --> 08:40.015
It was you this morning,
wasn't it, waiting for Anne?

08:40.065 --> 08:42.784
Oh, what am I supposed to do with that?

08:42.835 --> 08:45.355
You saw the video. She had the book.

08:45.405 --> 08:46.785
She had a book.

08:46.835 --> 08:49.185
The same book that was stolen
the night Jocelyn was raped.

08:49.235 --> 08:51.255
A book that has a million copies in print.

08:51.305 --> 08:55.165
Yes, except this one had
PJ's software hidden inside.

08:55.215 --> 08:59.065
So you're saying that Anne ordered somebody

08:59.115 --> 09:01.635
to rape Jocelyn in front of PJ

09:01.685 --> 09:03.135
to cover up stealing a book?

09:03.185 --> 09:04.735
In what world does that make sense?

09:04.785 --> 09:08.645
In a world where she was
having an affair with our son.

09:08.695 --> 09:11.945
That world does not exist.

09:11.995 --> 09:13.415
PJ never even met her.

09:13.465 --> 09:16.485
Crys, I'm right about this.

09:16.535 --> 09:19.755
How do you know?

09:19.805 --> 09:21.415
Visions from God?

09:21.465 --> 09:23.785
Voices?

09:25.205 --> 09:28.325
In two days, we have to
say goodbye to our son.

09:28.375 --> 09:29.925
No, we don't.

09:29.975 --> 09:33.035
Yes, yes, we do.

09:33.085 --> 09:36.435
And I want you there, by my side.

09:36.485 --> 09:38.205
But if you do anything

09:38.255 --> 09:42.445
to make me even the least bit nervous,

09:42.495 --> 09:45.415
I will call the police myself.

09:56.375 --> 09:59.295
You're gonna have coverage
of the whole stage.

09:59.345 --> 10:01.295
That way you can move!

10:01.345 --> 10:04.595
But you can't just stop
willy-nilly. No, no.

10:04.645 --> 10:09.935
You have to land on one
of the three sweet spots.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.465
That way, the camera knows you're there,

10:11.515 --> 10:12.935
and the lights are set up for you.

10:12.985 --> 10:14.905
That's when you're in the money.

10:14.955 --> 10:17.775
Now, this is the Father,

10:17.825 --> 10:20.775
this is the Son,

10:20.825 --> 10:25.955
and this is the Holy Spirit!

10:26.005 --> 10:27.955
Bishop Bruce always likes to say that,

10:28.005 --> 10:30.325
"When in doubt, stick
with the Trinity, baby."

10:30.375 --> 10:31.995
This reminds me of my acting days.

10:32.045 --> 10:35.165
Oh, that's right. TV guy, yeah.

10:35.215 --> 10:36.625
Well, this is gonna be easy for you.

10:38.385 --> 10:40.795
Excuse me, what are you
doing with our piano?

10:40.845 --> 10:42.465
Oh, that's... that's my call.

10:42.515 --> 10:44.365
I need that spot for the camera position.

10:44.415 --> 10:46.005
We need this for praise and worship.

10:46.055 --> 10:48.175
- On top of the band?
- We don't have a band.

10:48.225 --> 10:52.945
You're gonna have a four piece
with keyboards for the telecast.

10:52.995 --> 10:55.185
Bishop Bruce is providing that.

10:55.235 --> 10:56.545
Go ahead and get that out of here.

10:56.595 --> 10:59.415
Ah, thank you, but that is not necessary.

10:59.465 --> 11:02.625
We like just a piano and a small choir,

11:02.675 --> 11:04.025
and a guitar sometimes.

11:04.075 --> 11:05.225
We keep it simple.

11:05.275 --> 11:07.695
You said you liked that about us.

11:07.745 --> 11:11.395
Well, there's a difference
between real-life simple

11:11.445 --> 11:14.265
and TV simple.

11:14.315 --> 11:17.035
And what happened to, "We
want to follow your lead?"

11:17.085 --> 11:20.775
We do, and we are. We're
not saying no to a band.

11:20.825 --> 11:24.075
But the piano has to stay.

11:24.125 --> 11:27.775
We came up with a song to open
our first televised service

11:27.825 --> 11:32.255
with two years ago, when all
this was just a pipe dream.

11:32.305 --> 11:35.625
- If you heard Paul play...
- And Alicia sing,

11:35.675 --> 11:37.425
you would know.

11:41.205 --> 11:45.895
Well, and the bishop says "Let it stay."

11:53.385 --> 11:55.175
Hey, hey.

12:00.565 --> 12:02.485
What's she doing here?

12:02.535 --> 12:04.515
I came to see what was wrong with Khalil.

12:04.565 --> 12:07.355
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Well, he was.

12:07.405 --> 12:10.355
He called me, told me
about getting thrown around

12:10.405 --> 12:13.655
like a common criminal,
having guns pulled on him.

12:13.705 --> 12:15.795
- You told her?
- Well, he didn't want to,

12:15.845 --> 12:19.165
but I could tell something was
wrong just by hearing his voice,

12:19.215 --> 12:21.195
like a mother should.

12:21.245 --> 12:22.465
Pulled the rest out of him.

12:22.515 --> 12:25.005
I took care of it.

12:25.055 --> 12:28.545
I spent 18 years keeping
this child's nose clean.

12:28.595 --> 12:31.845
You know how hard that is
with a boy where we come from?

12:31.895 --> 12:33.315
But I did.

12:33.365 --> 12:36.285
One month with you in
charge, and look what happens.

12:36.335 --> 12:38.755
You know, I told him it was
a mistake coming around you,

12:38.805 --> 12:40.955
but he wanted to be hardheaded.

12:41.005 --> 12:44.025
You must've passed that down to him.

12:44.075 --> 12:45.525
What did you say?

12:46.545 --> 12:48.165
I said, "Get your bag."

12:48.215 --> 12:51.095
What do you mean, she passed it down?

12:51.145 --> 12:52.265
- Get out.
- Yo, some...

12:52.315 --> 12:53.735
somebody has to answer that.

12:53.785 --> 12:56.465
I'm not leaving without my baby.

12:56.515 --> 12:57.735
He is not your baby.

12:57.785 --> 13:00.075
He is my baby, and he's better off with me.

13:00.125 --> 13:01.635
I want you to stay, Khalil.

13:01.685 --> 13:03.705
I'm sorry about what happened to you,

13:03.755 --> 13:04.845
but it would not happen again.

13:04.895 --> 13:07.175
I am good for you now.

13:08.795 --> 13:13.785
Ma, I... I told you I'm not
trying to go to San Jose.

13:13.835 --> 13:14.985
You hear what he called me?

13:15.035 --> 13:17.785
Ma, 'cause I raised him.

13:17.835 --> 13:21.995
I call you Ma, too. You
didn't do shit for me.

13:22.045 --> 13:23.795
You coming?

13:27.045 --> 13:31.005
Oh, gonna be hardheaded just like her.

13:31.055 --> 13:34.375
Call me when you come around to it.

13:44.195 --> 13:48.255
He's fixated on this
woman, this random woman.

13:48.305 --> 13:51.325
And he thinks God is
sending him messages again.

13:51.375 --> 13:52.855
I need you to talk to him.

13:52.905 --> 13:54.525
I'd be happy to,

13:54.575 --> 13:57.625
but I told you Pernell should've
stayed at Serenity Lake.

13:57.675 --> 13:58.935
Nobody wanted to listen.

13:58.985 --> 14:00.665
It seemed that he was getting better.

14:00.715 --> 14:04.865
He was, and if he comes
back, he will, if he stays.

14:08.425 --> 14:10.175
We're...

14:10.225 --> 14:12.745
we're turning off the
respirator in two days.

14:15.895 --> 14:17.545
He can take a field trip.

14:18.705 --> 14:20.755
No, it's more than that.

14:20.805 --> 14:25.795
Pernell is the director of
the Harris family estate.

14:27.505 --> 14:29.925
And you're afraid if he's hospitalized

14:29.975 --> 14:33.195
for an extended time, he'll
be declared incompetent?

14:33.245 --> 14:37.135
And control of the trust
would go to his heir, PJ.

14:37.185 --> 14:40.075
And if there is no heir?

14:40.125 --> 14:41.375
The trust is very specific

14:41.425 --> 14:44.545
that the estate remains

14:44.595 --> 14:46.475
in the hands of a blood relative,

14:46.525 --> 14:49.145
and that would be Pernell's aunt Val,

14:49.195 --> 14:51.915
and if she gets control...

14:51.965 --> 14:54.215
it... it can't happen.

14:54.265 --> 14:56.855
Because you'd be cut off? Of course.

14:56.905 --> 14:59.325
I wondered how you were
gonna make this all about you.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.655
I'm not making this all about me.

15:00.705 --> 15:02.425
Bullshit. You're putting your needs

15:02.475 --> 15:04.165
ahead of getting Pernell
the treatment he needs again.

15:04.215 --> 15:07.165
Fuck you. He's about to lose his son.

15:07.215 --> 15:08.665
Is he supposed to lose everything else too?

15:08.715 --> 15:10.105
Is that how you think
he's gonna get better?

15:10.155 --> 15:11.465
You asked me to come here.

15:11.515 --> 15:14.335
You told me he was fixated with some woman.

15:14.385 --> 15:17.445
You obviously think he needs help.

15:19.765 --> 15:22.515
I do not want him hospitalized again.

15:22.565 --> 15:27.455
Can you just point me in
the right direction with him?

15:27.505 --> 15:30.685
You can't wish this away.

15:30.735 --> 15:32.495
If you're gonna leave him out here

15:32.545 --> 15:34.625
and you don't want a
disaster on your hands,

15:34.675 --> 15:37.165
then you better follow the formula.

15:37.215 --> 15:40.135
One, medication. Two, therapy.

15:40.185 --> 15:44.305
Three, eliminate negative influences.

15:46.425 --> 15:48.775
For a small gift of $12, you can receive

15:48.825 --> 15:52.345
your own DVD copy of Reverend Paul's series

15:52.395 --> 15:54.145
"One True Freedom,"

15:54.195 --> 15:55.845
four hours that will knock your empty life

15:55.895 --> 15:58.455
and point you to the
prosperity and peace of mind

15:58.505 --> 16:01.215
that comes with true freedom.

16:01.265 --> 16:03.655
Praise God.

16:03.705 --> 16:04.885
Hi.

16:04.935 --> 16:08.225
I was wondering if you knew
where I could find Keith.

16:08.275 --> 16:11.895
No. I'm actually on my way out, so...

16:13.485 --> 16:14.965
Well, if you did know, would you tell me?

16:15.015 --> 16:16.305
Probably not.

16:18.285 --> 16:19.975
I guess I deserve that...

16:21.225 --> 16:23.775
after the way I talked to you.

16:30.665 --> 16:32.455
I'm sorry.

16:35.775 --> 16:39.455
We prayed for you. We prayed for your son.

16:39.505 --> 16:42.195
We introduced you to the Holy Father.

16:42.245 --> 16:43.595
When you called, whenever you called,

16:43.645 --> 16:45.235
Paul always came running to help.

16:45.285 --> 16:47.495
- And I'm grateful.
- Grateful?

16:47.545 --> 16:51.065
You accused us of targeting you.

16:51.115 --> 16:54.235
I thought I was on the wrong path,

16:54.285 --> 16:58.215
and I thought that was Paul's fault.

16:58.265 --> 17:00.775
- Now I know.
- Know what?

17:00.825 --> 17:04.415
Sometimes God asks you to do things...

17:04.464 --> 17:09.984
that other people just don't understand.

17:10.035 --> 17:12.655
Anyway...

17:12.704 --> 17:16.365
If you see Keith, could you...

17:16.415 --> 17:18.964
tell him I'm trying to
get in touch with him?

17:21.145 --> 17:22.365
He's here.

17:25.984 --> 17:27.805
He's downstairs.

17:41.165 --> 17:42.955
Hey, Keith.

17:43.005 --> 17:44.385
Good to see you.

17:48.045 --> 17:51.825
I... I know I put us...

17:51.875 --> 17:55.735
I put you in a bad situation.

17:55.785 --> 17:58.935
I'm sorry.

17:58.985 --> 18:01.905
But I come bearing good news.

18:04.195 --> 18:08.345
I know who's behind everything.

18:08.395 --> 18:10.485
We're at the end of this,

18:10.535 --> 18:13.285
but I can't finish it without you.

18:13.335 --> 18:15.925
I need you.

18:15.975 --> 18:17.625
I need my Benaiah.

18:24.115 --> 18:26.095
Satan, I rebuke thee.

18:27.585 --> 18:29.665
What?

18:29.715 --> 18:32.905
In the name of Jesus
Christ, my Lord and Savior,

18:32.955 --> 18:34.035
I rebuke thee!

18:47.205 --> 18:48.725
Smoke?

18:50.705 --> 18:52.555
Huh.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.615
Biggest moment of my career,
and you're staying home.

19:17.665 --> 19:21.385
Your granddaddy had a stick.

19:21.435 --> 19:22.785
A club, really.

19:23.805 --> 19:24.825
This story?

19:26.075 --> 19:27.255
His talking stick.

19:27.305 --> 19:29.125
Anytime he felt disrespected,

19:29.175 --> 19:31.425
he'd grab that stick and
go off for a little talk.

19:31.475 --> 19:33.035
One night, he came home so beat down,

19:33.085 --> 19:36.965
looked like somebody'd
run him over with a truck.

19:37.015 --> 19:39.535
I was crying.

19:39.585 --> 19:43.245
My mama begged him not
to go back out there,

19:43.295 --> 19:45.715
because she knew that...

19:45.765 --> 19:49.685
the people he wanted to talk to

19:49.735 --> 19:51.815
didn't think nothing about killing niggers.

19:51.865 --> 19:54.215
Might've heard this story
up to a hundred times.

19:54.265 --> 19:57.655
I've been telling it to you
since the day you were born

19:57.705 --> 20:00.525
because I wanted you to know

20:00.575 --> 20:03.495
what kind of man I expected out of you.

20:04.415 --> 20:06.435
What did he say?

20:06.485 --> 20:09.405
What did he tell my mama, son?

20:13.885 --> 20:19.275
He said, "They might kill me,
but I'm gonna have my say."

20:19.325 --> 20:21.645
That's right.

20:21.695 --> 20:24.545
That's the kind of blood we come from.

20:24.595 --> 20:28.255
It flows through us.

20:29.835 --> 20:32.625
Now, I hear you let some
white boy call you nigger

20:32.675 --> 20:36.195
like it wasn't nothing, like
you ain't got no history.

20:36.245 --> 20:38.395
Oh, I know I got history.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.465
What I didn't have was a grandpa,

20:40.515 --> 20:42.035
'cause one time he didn't come back.

20:43.185 --> 20:44.965
He died a man.

20:46.655 --> 20:48.135
You don't think I'm a man?

20:59.205 --> 21:02.115
I'm so sorry I let you down.

21:02.165 --> 21:04.055
I'm sorry being the
first person in our family

21:04.105 --> 21:06.125
to graduate college wasn't enough.

21:06.175 --> 21:08.795
Being the first black mayor
in this city isn't enough.

21:08.845 --> 21:11.965
After I get my concrete pour tomorrow,

21:12.015 --> 21:13.665
I'm gonna be the one pushing buttons

21:13.715 --> 21:15.565
and pulling the strings.

21:17.355 --> 21:20.875
I took what I had to take,
and I gave what I had to give.

21:20.925 --> 21:23.505
That's what a fucking man is,

21:23.555 --> 21:25.375
not someone who leaves his family

21:25.425 --> 21:26.615
with a stick in his hand

21:26.665 --> 21:28.115
and never comes back.

21:39.275 --> 21:41.295
Ugh!

21:41.345 --> 21:43.495
Ugh! Keith, listen to me.

21:43.545 --> 21:45.225
Please let me talk to you.

21:45.275 --> 21:47.335
The blueness of a wound

21:47.385 --> 21:49.005
cleanseth away evil.

21:49.055 --> 21:51.135
So do stripes on the
inward parts of the belly.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.335
Hmm?

21:52.385 --> 21:54.005
I'm not evil.

21:54.055 --> 21:55.505
I made a mistake, but God favors me.

21:55.555 --> 21:57.105
You know he does.

21:57.155 --> 21:58.175
Aah.

21:58.225 --> 21:59.515
False prophets

21:59.565 --> 22:01.145
and those who seek their guidance

22:01.195 --> 22:02.785
shall all be punished for their sins.

22:02.835 --> 22:04.885
Ugh!

22:04.935 --> 22:06.885
But if a spirit or an angel has spoken,

22:06.935 --> 22:09.585
let us not fight against God.

22:09.635 --> 22:13.325
Shut up! You're not anointed!

22:13.375 --> 22:14.525
Yes, I am!

22:14.575 --> 22:15.595
Aah!

22:15.645 --> 22:18.095
But I'm just not perfect.

22:18.145 --> 22:19.595
I'm a man.

22:19.645 --> 22:21.565
Just like Solomon, I can make mistakes,

22:21.615 --> 22:25.065
and just like Solomon,
I can atone for them.

22:25.115 --> 22:28.545
Keith, listen to me.

22:28.595 --> 22:30.905
I love you.

22:30.955 --> 22:32.915
I never meant to fail you.

22:32.965 --> 22:35.785
- You are my Benaiah.
- No.

22:37.595 --> 22:38.755
That's all I wanted.

22:38.805 --> 22:40.685
Well, that's what it is, son.

22:40.735 --> 22:43.785
I mean, think about it.

22:43.835 --> 22:46.655
You got Shane to confess before he died.

22:46.705 --> 22:48.695
You found out that the
book had been missing.

22:48.745 --> 22:51.325
You got us Julio and
the Eastwood apartments.

22:51.375 --> 22:53.195
You even knew I was a modern-day Solomon

22:53.245 --> 22:54.595
even before I did.

22:54.645 --> 22:57.135
Ah, but Solomon wouldn't
have told his Benaiah

22:57.185 --> 22:58.405
to kill an innocent man.

22:58.455 --> 23:00.605
I carry that death on my soul.

23:00.655 --> 23:03.805
No! You acted with a pure heart.

23:03.855 --> 23:05.775
Josh's murder is on my soul.

23:05.825 --> 23:07.415
It's the sin I have to bear

23:07.465 --> 23:09.115
for the rest of my days, not you.

23:09.165 --> 23:12.855
Your hands are clean. Your calling is true.

23:17.475 --> 23:21.995
Aah! And as for the scoundrel,
his devices are evil!

23:22.045 --> 23:26.495
He makes wicked plans to ruin
the poor with his lying words!

23:26.545 --> 23:29.135
Agh! Uh! Aah!

23:29.185 --> 23:32.235
Let me prove it to you!
I know where the book is!

23:34.725 --> 23:37.275
God revealed it to me.

23:37.325 --> 23:41.175
If I could... if I
could bring you the book,

23:41.225 --> 23:43.115
would you believe me?

23:49.435 --> 23:50.685
I would.

23:50.735 --> 23:53.195
And would you help me finish this?

23:53.245 --> 23:55.255
Help me save PJ.

23:57.675 --> 23:58.965
I would.

24:02.115 --> 24:06.235
But if you're wrong... I will kill you.

24:07.385 --> 24:11.075
If I'm wrong, I want you to.

24:16.265 --> 24:19.215
JOCELYN: My love runs
by like a day in June,

24:19.265 --> 24:22.655
and it makes no friends of sorrows.

24:22.705 --> 24:24.455
He'll tread his galloping rigadoon

24:24.505 --> 24:27.725
in the pathway of the morrows.

24:27.775 --> 24:30.995
He'll live his days where sunbeams start,

24:31.045 --> 24:34.895
nor could storm or wind uproot him.

24:34.945 --> 24:37.735
My own dear love, he is all my heart,

24:37.785 --> 24:39.075
and I wish somebody...

24:39.955 --> 24:41.935
Sorry to interrupt.

24:41.985 --> 24:43.505
I thought we could spend some time

24:43.555 --> 24:44.705
going through everything
that's going to happen

24:44.755 --> 24:46.075
with PJ on Friday.

24:46.125 --> 24:47.845
I've done that part before.

24:47.895 --> 24:49.785
I know how it goes.

24:49.835 --> 24:52.115
Yes, of course. Sorry.

24:52.165 --> 24:54.085
It's all right.

25:17.995 --> 25:20.275
Oh.

25:20.325 --> 25:22.815
They're still calling the reinforcements.

25:22.865 --> 25:24.185
As she should have.

25:24.235 --> 25:26.955
I hear you're back on a holy mission.

25:29.535 --> 25:30.825
We got nothing to talk about.

25:30.875 --> 25:33.495
Come on. I came all this way.

25:34.875 --> 25:36.995
Can I at least have a drink?

25:38.885 --> 25:41.435
For the road.

25:41.485 --> 25:42.495
What's your poison?

25:42.545 --> 25:43.965
What's in the fancy bottle?

25:44.015 --> 25:46.975
- Fancy scotch.
- I'll take it.

25:51.825 --> 25:53.475
Here's what I got to know.

25:53.525 --> 25:54.845
All that work you did,

25:54.895 --> 25:56.785
all that pain you looked in the eye,

25:56.835 --> 25:58.985
you really want it to be for nothing?

25:59.035 --> 26:00.855
No.

26:00.905 --> 26:04.425
It meant something. It changed me.

26:06.875 --> 26:09.025
Let me ask you a question.

26:09.075 --> 26:11.165
What if these visions are real?

26:11.215 --> 26:13.065
They are.

26:13.115 --> 26:14.965
They're just not from God.

26:15.015 --> 26:17.935
They're from the deep,
fucked-up recesses of your mind.

26:17.985 --> 26:19.975
You know what? If you're not
gonna take this seriously,

26:20.025 --> 26:21.505
I got other shit to do.

26:21.555 --> 26:24.205
Like get to the hospital?

26:36.875 --> 26:38.555
You're a judge.

26:38.605 --> 26:42.525
You're familiar with
involuntary commitments.

26:42.575 --> 26:44.195
You must know the standard,

26:44.245 --> 26:47.265
"A danger to yourself or
others," so which one are you?

26:47.315 --> 26:49.835
I never said anything
that justifies a 5150.

26:49.885 --> 26:51.465
It doesn't have to be you.

26:51.515 --> 26:54.805
If you're justifiably
concerned wife came to me,

26:54.855 --> 26:56.205
asking to sign off,

26:56.255 --> 26:58.975
I promise I will have your ass committed.

26:59.025 --> 27:02.175
What is it exactly you
think is wrong with me?

27:02.225 --> 27:04.145
The technical term is delusional,

27:04.195 --> 27:07.815
brought on by a prolonged,
acute stress reaction.

27:07.865 --> 27:10.025
And that's your diagnosis, right?

27:10.075 --> 27:11.255
That's what you think it is?

27:11.305 --> 27:13.255
Well, based on your symptoms,

27:13.305 --> 27:15.525
and everything we've talked
about, I'm pretty fucking sure.

27:15.575 --> 27:18.625
Pretty fucking s... are you
100 fucking percent or not?

27:18.675 --> 27:20.295
99 isn't good enough for you?

27:20.345 --> 27:21.835
No, I just find it a little curious.

27:21.885 --> 27:23.835
Just throwing around "delusional"

27:23.885 --> 27:25.735
like it's some fucking fact, but it's not.

27:25.785 --> 27:28.845
I mean, that last one percent is
just you filling in the blanks.

27:28.895 --> 27:31.045
You're taking shit you think you know,

27:31.095 --> 27:33.745
and you're just making your best guess.

27:33.795 --> 27:36.485
You know what they call that in church?

27:36.535 --> 27:37.985
Faith.

27:45.675 --> 27:47.195
Thanks for the scotch.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.945
Whew.

28:07.995 --> 28:10.785
Hey, you're right on time.

28:10.835 --> 28:12.245
Yeah.

28:12.375 --> 28:14.495
I was hoping you could, uh,

28:14.545 --> 28:16.665
front me some money for a bus ticket.

28:16.715 --> 28:19.775
You don't want to wait until
the end of the school year?

28:21.025 --> 28:22.375
I thought I could, but I can't.

28:22.425 --> 28:25.075
This isn't something we can't talk about.

28:26.595 --> 28:28.045
Get past.

28:28.095 --> 28:29.985
I was thinking that too, but...

28:30.035 --> 28:32.845
every time we talk,

28:32.895 --> 28:34.715
it's only gonna end with me

28:34.765 --> 28:37.725
not understanding why you walked out on me.

28:41.775 --> 28:43.465
I tried.

28:43.515 --> 28:45.995
She called the police,
said I had to get out.

28:46.045 --> 28:47.735
And you just left me? You just...

28:47.785 --> 28:50.865
Khalil, I was 16.

28:50.915 --> 28:54.005
I didn't know any better.

28:54.055 --> 28:56.675
Okay, you were 16.

28:56.725 --> 29:01.715
And then you were 17 and 18 and 19.

29:01.765 --> 29:05.485
You were 25.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.115
At some point, you knew better.

29:09.575 --> 29:14.055
I mean, shit, you had
money, this life, all of it,

29:14.105 --> 29:15.825
and you still didn't come back for me.

29:15.875 --> 29:18.395
This was gonna be my
chance to make it up to you.

29:21.745 --> 29:23.805
It's a $24 ticket.

29:25.655 --> 29:27.305
I'll get it back to you.

30:23.115 --> 30:25.665
I'm sorry.

30:25.715 --> 30:27.635
I'm sorry.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.700
Pernell?

31:22.150 --> 31:26.840
Before you start, I just want
to say I'm glad you called her.

31:26.890 --> 31:29.710
You think I wanted to? That woman hates me.

31:29.760 --> 31:33.440
But every time I let myself
think, "Oh, it's not that bad,"

31:33.490 --> 31:35.740
you prove me wrong.

31:35.790 --> 31:37.610
How else am I gonna protect you?

31:39.160 --> 31:42.350
I'm just not very good at being powerless.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.990
I was hoping there's something I can do,

31:45.040 --> 31:46.920
but there isn't.

31:46.970 --> 31:48.420
Dr. Langston doesn't think

31:48.470 --> 31:50.830
you should come to the
concrete pour tomorrow.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.090
I think she's right.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.000
Fine, it's settled. I'll stay home.

31:54.050 --> 31:58.070
And you'll let PJ go?

31:58.120 --> 32:02.500
I guess I wasn't as ready to
say good-bye as I thought I was.

32:02.550 --> 32:06.610
But I'm done chasing ghosts.

32:06.660 --> 32:09.280
Promise?

32:09.330 --> 32:11.610
Cross my heart.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.850
You got nothing to worry about.

32:19.670 --> 32:22.060
So she really didn't have the abortion,

32:22.110 --> 32:23.590
but he thinks she did?

32:23.640 --> 32:27.360
This big preacher, Bishop
Bruce, got them on notice.

32:27.410 --> 32:30.430
They slip up, they get
cut out of the TV thing.

32:35.990 --> 32:38.770
You must really like this Alicia girl.

32:40.230 --> 32:43.410
I mean, I feel sorry for
her. She's just a little girl.

32:43.460 --> 32:47.320
She has friends. I
mean, like, real friends.

32:47.370 --> 32:49.850
I mean, maybe you can call it that.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.120
What about us?

32:53.170 --> 32:55.020
I thought we were friends,

32:55.070 --> 32:57.630
and then you wait until my
husband's stalking people

32:57.680 --> 33:00.830
before you tell me anything.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.570
This ain't dirt on the preacher,
this is dirt on the girl,

33:03.620 --> 33:05.800
and I don't think she deserves to be hurt.

33:05.850 --> 33:06.740
Pernell does?

33:06.790 --> 33:09.810
Pernell is a grown-ass fucking judge,

33:09.860 --> 33:12.610
and I figure he's more to
blame for this than anyone.

33:12.660 --> 33:15.040
And it's not like you gave me any details

33:15.090 --> 33:16.210
to make me think different.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.910
You just said, "I need help."

33:18.960 --> 33:20.380
If I was your friend,

33:20.430 --> 33:24.120
you would have told me everything.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.790
Now I know how bad it is.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.320
And I'm telling you something

33:27.370 --> 33:30.560
that might help you with the preacher.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.080
I can't quite believe
this is really happening.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.880
You earned it.

34:27.929 --> 34:30.719
Not just me.

34:30.770 --> 34:33.150
This has changed quite a bit.

34:37.139 --> 34:40.800
Mrs. Harris, welcome back to Hand of God.

34:40.850 --> 34:43.130
Can I help you?

34:43.179 --> 34:45.600
Getting much use out of my piano?

34:45.650 --> 34:49.440
It has been a wonderful
addition to our worship services.

34:49.489 --> 34:50.610
You should hear Paul play.

34:50.659 --> 34:52.440
I'll pass. Thank you.

34:52.489 --> 34:55.010
If you're looking for
Pernell, he's not here.

34:55.060 --> 34:59.110
The Pernell I love has been
missing for quite a while.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.420
Ever since he ran into you two.

35:01.470 --> 35:03.080
Brother Harris found God's love.

35:03.130 --> 35:07.520
Many people find their lives
transformed by the experience.

35:07.570 --> 35:10.130
It can take time for their
relationships to adjust.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.300
Exactly what I was thinking.

35:15.350 --> 35:19.540
I came here to adjust your relationship

35:19.590 --> 35:21.640
with my husband,

35:21.690 --> 35:23.200
by which I mean end it.

35:24.760 --> 35:28.080
I know you don't think
highly of us, Mrs. Harris,

35:28.130 --> 35:31.210
but we won't close the door
of this church to anyone

35:31.260 --> 35:33.080
who feels called to come in.

35:38.500 --> 35:43.860
I called Bishop Congdon earlier.

35:43.910 --> 35:47.300
It's so cute the way he refers
to himself in the third person,

35:47.350 --> 35:48.860
isn't it? Anyway...

35:48.910 --> 35:53.470
I told him that a member of your flock

35:53.520 --> 35:55.470
is pregnant with your child.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.610
That's not true.

35:58.660 --> 36:00.780
That is a bald-faced lie. Why?

36:00.830 --> 36:03.280
Because you had her get an abortion?

36:07.230 --> 36:12.220
You didn't actually go into
the room with her, did you?

36:13.710 --> 36:16.220
Bishop Bruce was very upset,

36:16.270 --> 36:19.760
and he made it very clear
that you will not be included

36:19.810 --> 36:24.670
in his One in a Savior... Flock Block.

36:35.090 --> 36:36.580
I did everything I was supposed to.

36:36.630 --> 36:38.650
Except stay away from Pernell.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.650
I built the stairway.
It's done, it's happening.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.550
I need to speak to the bishop.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.750
Paul, no. It's done.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.120
The broadcast is not happening.

36:47.170 --> 36:49.730
And that's not what this is about anymore.

36:49.780 --> 36:52.590
Now, it's about whether
you get to keep your church.

36:52.640 --> 36:55.860
Because you can stop the bleeding...

36:57.150 --> 37:02.100
or I can make sure everybody
in your congregation knows.

37:06.420 --> 37:11.010
Paul.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.650
You listening?

37:14.670 --> 37:15.880
We're listening.

37:20.210 --> 37:21.560
So you understand.

37:21.610 --> 37:26.760
The only way you get
to keep these doors open

37:26.810 --> 37:29.430
is you stay away from my husband.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.670
We understand.

37:41.130 --> 37:46.410
And for what it's worth, I
think you did the right thing.

37:46.460 --> 37:49.220
Because there is no guarantee

37:49.270 --> 37:53.150
that you ever get to have another one.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.220
I only got to have one.

37:57.310 --> 37:59.230
And I lose him tomorrow.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.960
Okay?

38:38.780 --> 38:40.800
I thought you were staying home.

38:40.850 --> 38:42.770
How could I miss this?

38:45.460 --> 38:46.440
Pernell.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.010
A pleasant surprise.

38:48.060 --> 38:48.940
Nathan.

38:48.990 --> 38:50.650
Crystal said you weren't coming.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.080
Well, obviously this is a big day for you,

38:52.130 --> 38:53.650
but in its own way, it's an even bigger day

38:53.700 --> 38:54.920
for my best friend Robert,

38:54.970 --> 38:56.220
so I'm here for him.

38:56.270 --> 38:57.250
Of course.

38:57.300 --> 38:59.020
I appreciate that kind of loyalty.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.120
You wouldn't happen to know
where the mayor is, would you?

39:05.240 --> 39:07.330
You haven't spoken to Mayor Boston yet?

39:07.380 --> 39:09.100
I'm sure he'll be here any minute, yes?

39:09.150 --> 39:10.530
He's not answering his mobile,

39:10.580 --> 39:12.430
but he did leave the
office, like, an hour ago,

39:12.480 --> 39:13.840
so I'm sure he's close.

39:13.890 --> 39:15.370
Yeah, well, we're already running late,

39:15.420 --> 39:17.370
if nobody's talked to
him, let's not count on it.

39:17.420 --> 39:19.440
People of San Vicente
have waited long enough.

39:23.130 --> 39:24.750
Maybe you should go home.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.110
I'm fine.

39:27.370 --> 39:29.690
- You're staring at her.
- I'm fine.

39:29.740 --> 39:31.420
Don't worry about it.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.860
Today, we literally lay the foundation

39:33.910 --> 39:35.990
for the future of Brooks Innovations.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.730
I've heard the news reports,

39:37.780 --> 39:39.260
politicians talking about

39:39.310 --> 39:43.000
how much San Vicente
needs Brooks Innovations.

39:43.050 --> 39:48.740
Jobs, taxes, economic revitalization.

39:48.790 --> 39:51.170
But the truth is, we need San Vicente.

39:51.220 --> 39:54.980
Brooks Innovations' mission is
to connect people to each other.

39:55.030 --> 39:56.880
It doesn't mean high-speed Internet

39:56.930 --> 39:59.820
or an automated house or
a car that drives itself.

39:59.870 --> 40:01.120
It means understanding that

40:01.170 --> 40:02.850
no matter how much money we have,

40:02.900 --> 40:06.020
our individual lives and
struggles can overpower us

40:06.070 --> 40:08.220
without each other's love and support...

40:08.270 --> 40:11.560
support from real people
with hearts and souls,

40:11.610 --> 40:14.930
like the people of San Vicente,

40:14.980 --> 40:16.630
who remind us every day

40:16.680 --> 40:20.670
why we must restore our
connections with each other.

40:20.720 --> 40:23.300
And it starts today.

40:58.860 --> 41:01.180
What are you doing?

41:01.230 --> 41:02.480
Nothing.

41:02.530 --> 41:04.310
You're making me nervous.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.110
You know something? I think you're right.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.780
I'm just not feeling up to this.

41:07.830 --> 41:10.890
Bobo's not even here, and with
what we got going tomorrow,

41:10.940 --> 41:12.350
I think I'm gonna head back to the house.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.790
Yeah. I think that's a good idea.

41:13.840 --> 41:14.920
And you know, I'll just stay

41:14.970 --> 41:16.220
long enough to make an appearance,

41:16.270 --> 41:18.090
and then I'll check out myself.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.800
Love you.

41:19.850 --> 41:21.230
You, too.

41:42.930 --> 41:45.390
You bring something to drink?

41:49.440 --> 41:51.330
You know I did.

41:59.080 --> 42:00.970
They already started, huh?

42:01.020 --> 42:02.470
Yeah.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.540
There ain't no turning back now.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.580
You know what that is?

42:11.630 --> 42:13.850
That's my stick.

42:13.900 --> 42:15.450
I'm gonna have my say.

42:22.770 --> 42:24.660
Well, I voted for a reflecting pool,

42:24.710 --> 42:27.230
but the environmental
community shut it right down.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.700
You know, with the drought,
you just can't mention water.

42:29.750 --> 42:31.900
Can we switch task partners?

42:31.950 --> 42:33.770
Nathan would like a moment.

42:33.820 --> 42:35.970
Um, excuse me, everyone.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.780
Quite a sight, isn't it?

42:45.830 --> 42:48.050
Yes.

42:48.100 --> 42:51.090
It's been a remarkable day.

42:51.140 --> 42:52.590
I want to take a moment and thank you

42:52.640 --> 42:54.890
for all that you've
done to make it possible.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.960
Oh, thank you, Nathan.

42:57.010 --> 43:00.330
- Are you proud?
- I am.

43:00.380 --> 43:01.700
You should be.

43:03.550 --> 43:04.900
You know, this would be the perfect time

43:04.950 --> 43:06.270
for someone with your ambition

43:06.320 --> 43:09.000
to move on in search of the next conquest.

43:09.050 --> 43:11.240
Oh, don't worry.

43:11.290 --> 43:13.670
My heart is with Brooks Innovations.

43:13.720 --> 43:16.110
I would never consider leaving.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.080
I think you should.

43:20.170 --> 43:23.150
If anyone asks, I'll
only sing your praises.

43:24.140 --> 43:25.920
Nathan, I have no desire to leave.

43:25.970 --> 43:27.420
I just found out Pernell Harris

43:27.470 --> 43:31.330
was in a psychiatric hospital
recently and you knew.

43:31.380 --> 43:34.230
Which means you hid it from me.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.030
I didn't hide it from you.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.570
I made a decision not
to worry you about it.

43:38.620 --> 43:41.400
It was temporary, and it
didn't affect our plans.

43:41.450 --> 43:42.970
Don't worry, Anne, you'll be just fine

43:43.020 --> 43:44.170
in whatever you choose do.

43:44.220 --> 43:47.010
I don't want to be just fine, Nathan.

43:47.060 --> 43:49.710
- Please, just...
- I need people I can count on.

43:49.760 --> 43:51.410
You're questioning my loyalty

43:51.460 --> 43:55.350
after everything I've done
for you and this company?

43:55.400 --> 43:57.790
Everything that you wanted,
everything that you needed,

43:57.840 --> 43:59.490
I gave to you.

43:59.540 --> 44:00.690
It's simple, Anne.

44:00.740 --> 44:02.960
I can't trust you anymore.

44:03.010 --> 44:06.090
No trust, no relationship, no job.

44:06.140 --> 44:10.870
You at least owe me an
opportunity to fix this.

44:10.920 --> 44:12.730
You can't end it on one mistake.

44:12.780 --> 44:14.370
You make it sound like
we need to stay together

44:14.420 --> 44:17.010
for the sake of the kids.

44:17.060 --> 44:18.540
We don't.

44:37.640 --> 44:39.260
God damn it.

44:47.050 --> 44:48.540
Things getting tight in the PD, Toby?

44:48.590 --> 44:50.340
They got you doing traffic stops now?

44:50.390 --> 44:52.470
Judge Harris, you
remember Detective Warren.

44:52.520 --> 44:54.740
- What's this about?
- We need you to come with us.

44:54.790 --> 44:57.180
Answer some questions about Shane Caldwell.

44:58.930 --> 45:01.150
Now's not good.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.020
Get out of the car.

45:05.070 --> 45:08.020
This is bullshit.

45:08.070 --> 45:10.430
We can do this easy or in cuffs.

45:12.210 --> 45:15.130
Toby, wait, God damn it.

45:17.650 --> 45:19.030
You don't like me. You never did.

45:19.080 --> 45:21.170
I know that.

45:21.220 --> 45:23.570
But you got kids.

45:23.620 --> 45:25.670
My son...

45:28.960 --> 45:32.710
They're shutting the machine
off on PJ in the morning.

45:32.760 --> 45:35.620
I got to be there.

45:35.670 --> 45:40.190
Please, it's only for a couple hours.

45:40.240 --> 45:43.260
Soon as it's done, I come in. I swear.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.940
Anne, what's wrong?

45:58.990 --> 46:01.710
The fucking boys' club. He sacked me.

46:01.760 --> 46:05.650
Nathan fucking smug
bastard Brooks sacked me.

46:05.700 --> 46:06.750
What?

46:06.800 --> 46:09.080
Now I can't even go home for a proper pinch

46:09.130 --> 46:10.690
'cause I've lost my fucking keys.

46:11.770 --> 46:13.090
You can't find your keys?

46:13.140 --> 46:14.560
I know I put them in here.

46:14.610 --> 46:17.690
I just don't know where
the fuck they've gone.

46:21.350 --> 46:23.260
I can give you a ride home.

46:24.150 --> 46:25.900
Come on.

46:39.330 --> 46:40.980
Do you want a drink?

46:41.030 --> 46:42.020
Sure, thanks.

46:42.070 --> 46:44.790
- Yeah? Wine?
- Great.

46:44.840 --> 46:45.950
This is nice.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.460
Thank you.

46:52.710 --> 46:54.730
You lived here long?

46:54.780 --> 46:56.530
Just a year.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.190
To the girls' club.

47:21.240 --> 47:22.990
Men. Fuck 'em.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.390
All of them.

47:29.310 --> 47:31.200
Do you mind if I just go wash up?

47:31.250 --> 47:33.270
No. Take your time.

47:43.790 --> 47:45.850
Pernell?

47:52.970 --> 47:54.960
Pernell?

48:22.070 --> 48:24.950
Crystal?

48:25.000 --> 48:26.420
Where did you go?

48:35.710 --> 48:37.330
You said you'd never met him.

48:38.850 --> 48:42.440
- Crystal...
- I don't... I don't understand.

48:43.620 --> 48:46.440
It was exactly what it looks like.

48:47.460 --> 48:51.610
He loved me, and I loved him.

48:52.460 --> 48:54.920
Since when?

48:54.970 --> 48:57.120
I know this must be a lot for you.

48:57.170 --> 48:58.990
Since fucking when?

48:59.040 --> 49:01.160
Since last year.

49:01.210 --> 49:02.560
I was just supposed to talk him

49:02.610 --> 49:05.360
into selling his Bathwater
program to Brooks.

49:05.410 --> 49:07.800
I didn't expect it to be...

49:09.950 --> 49:11.800
something else.

49:11.850 --> 49:14.500
One moment, he's explaining how his code

49:14.550 --> 49:16.040
is gonna change the world.

49:16.090 --> 49:18.010
The next, he's kissing me...

49:20.760 --> 49:21.840
then more.

49:21.890 --> 49:25.350
No, no. That's a lie.

49:25.400 --> 49:26.950
That's not who he is.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.350
He loved Jocelyn.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.050
What we had was real.

49:30.100 --> 49:31.420
It deserved time and care,

49:31.470 --> 49:33.090
but he wouldn't let me give it that.

49:35.940 --> 49:37.560
He ended it, didn't he?

49:39.510 --> 49:42.400
Because he couldn't keep doing that to her.

49:44.350 --> 49:46.300
It wasn't because he loved her more.

49:46.350 --> 49:48.040
It was because she'd got there first.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.720
And then what?

50:10.310 --> 50:12.330
He went back to his perfect life,

50:12.380 --> 50:15.100
and I went back to being me.

50:33.030 --> 50:34.550
How'd you get this?

50:42.170 --> 50:46.590
That was a parting gift
that I gave to myself.

50:57.050 --> 50:59.810
This was stolen

50:59.860 --> 51:02.710
the night Jocelyn was raped.

52:30.550 --> 52:33.670
She said she'd never met PJ.

54:06.380 --> 54:08.060
If you believe in us,

54:08.110 --> 54:11.570
believe in the work we're
doing here at Hand of God,

54:11.620 --> 54:13.800
then call our toll-free number.

54:13.850 --> 54:16.670
We'd love to hear from you right now.

54:16.720 --> 54:19.570
We need your support.

54:19.620 --> 54:22.940
See, Jesus loves us all so much,

54:22.990 --> 54:27.720
especially... when we spread His word.

54:32.170 --> 54:36.460

54:36.510 --> 54:40.830

55:20.580 --> 55:22.640
Come on.

55:22.690 --> 55:24.640
Let's get ready.

55:24.690 --> 55:27.740
I'm trying. It's not working.

55:30.430 --> 55:32.280
- I killed...
- Shh.

55:34.460 --> 55:37.350
Don't you dare.

55:37.400 --> 55:41.690
Don't you dare.

55:41.740 --> 55:45.230
You just saved our son's life.

55:48.250 --> 55:50.770
Is he here?

55:57.090 --> 55:59.240
Yeah.

55:59.290 --> 56:02.880
He's sitting right there on the bed.

56:05.830 --> 56:08.480
And he's saying "Thank you."

56:16.740 --> 56:19.290
Well, I put you at five weeks.

56:19.340 --> 56:21.300
It's never too early to
start prenatal vitamins.

56:21.350 --> 56:25.770
I recommend Mega Mommy, but
they all have what they all have.

56:25.820 --> 56:27.370
You look like you take care of yourself,

56:27.420 --> 56:28.700
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

56:28.750 --> 56:30.770
No smoking, keep alcohol to a minimum,

56:30.820 --> 56:33.270
and we'll see you here in a month.

56:33.320 --> 56:34.810
Thank you.

56:34.860 --> 56:36.210
I tell everyone, the first 12 weeks,

56:36.260 --> 56:39.010
anything can happen, so
it's up to you, but...

56:39.060 --> 56:42.450
Yeah. I'll keep it to myself for now.

57:00.150 --> 57:01.300
Classless.

57:03.050 --> 57:04.740
I'm just doing my job.

57:04.790 --> 57:06.910
Harassing a man on the same day

57:06.960 --> 57:07.940
he's pulling the plug on his son?

57:07.990 --> 57:09.340
Questioning a murder suspect.

57:09.390 --> 57:11.080
Oh, stop beating that horse. It's dead.

57:11.130 --> 57:14.410
No. Shane Caldwell's dead.

57:14.460 --> 57:19.120
We found vomit on his corpse,
ran a DNA test, got a match.

57:19.170 --> 57:21.120
You want to guess who it comes back to?

57:48.570 --> 57:50.150
I'll do this, okay?

59:02.910 --> 59:04.490
Oh, my God.

59:34.540 --> 59:36.090
Hallelujah.
