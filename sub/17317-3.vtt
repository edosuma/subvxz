WEBVTT

00:11.680 --> 00:15.320
Tonight, James goes racing in Finland.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.480
Richard tries out the future of motoring in Japan.

00:18.520 --> 00:21.360
And I cut up some wood near Godalming.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.880
APPLAUSE AND WHISTLING

00:31.920 --> 00:34.280
Good evening, hello. Hello, everybody.

00:34.320 --> 00:38.240
And welcome to what's a great show for me.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.360
Er, but first, OK, every year, Toyota, which, as we know,

00:41.400 --> 00:47.120
makes everything from Formula One cars, to big desert bashing off-roaders for the United Nations,

00:47.160 --> 00:53.080
says to its engineers, "Have a couple of weeks off, let your mind roam free, go mad.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.840
"Let's see what you come up with."

00:54.880 --> 00:59.800
And what they've come up with this year is, as I've been finding out, amazing.

01:02.120 --> 01:09.240
To get to this new car, I had to go to Toyota City, which is a whole city owned by Toyota.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.560
Imagine Birmingham, but full of Toyotas.

01:12.600 --> 01:17.160
The car was held here, in their brand new fortress of excellence headquarters.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.560
So things were looking good.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.280
Right. Er, here it is.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.480
There's no getting away from it.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.720
What we have here...

01:39.760 --> 01:41.240
is a chair.

01:43.160 --> 01:46.800
It is quite a special chair, though.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.160
They have said I can drive it today, here, in this room.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.480
But they are quite nervous.

01:53.520 --> 01:58.880
Put it this way, this is usually an office full of people, and desks.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.560
It's called the iReal

02:05.600 --> 02:10.160
and Toyota are hailing it as the future of personal transportation.

02:10.199 --> 02:14.320
'Before I drove it, though, I was taken to meet its inventor.'

02:14.360 --> 02:17.640
He explained the concept and the philosophy.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.960
(HE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE)

02:21.000 --> 02:23.480
And then he waited for me to ask a question.

02:23.520 --> 02:28.800
The trouble is, it's a while since Top Gear has done a grown-up interview.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.760
Will you make a big one for fat people?

02:35.120 --> 02:36.920
Interview over.

02:36.960 --> 02:43.360
I was briefed on how to use the toggles that control the throttle, the steering and the brakes.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.960
LONG TONE

02:46.000 --> 02:48.600
Wow! That's the horn?

02:48.640 --> 02:51.360
'And then I was off.'

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.200 --> 03:05.080
They are very polite people, so I'm saying this quietly.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.600
We have had something similar in the UK for some time.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.840
Called a wheelchair.

03:14.640 --> 03:22.000
However, when no-one was looking, I left the room and discovered that it was so much more than a wheelchair.

03:22.040 --> 03:28.160
In this mode, for example, the electric motors are trolleying me along at walking pace.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.560
But if I want to go faster, I just press this button,

03:32.600 --> 03:37.280
and then it drops down into sleek aerodynamic mode.

03:37.320 --> 03:40.880
Top speed then - 20 mph.

03:43.240 --> 03:47.600
Now, most creations like this are built just to get some coverage on motor shows.

03:47.640 --> 03:55.320
But Toyota aims to put the iReal on sale in 2010, for around £2,000.

03:55.360 --> 04:00.280
The plan is that we'll be using them for short journeys around town.

04:00.320 --> 04:04.000
And don't think OAP mobility scooter.

04:04.040 --> 04:08.280
Hip young things will forsake walking entirely and cruise around in these

04:08.320 --> 04:13.200
at night, downloading tunes to their iPod from their iReal.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.320
And these machines can talk to each other, too.

04:16.360 --> 04:21.360
Say I want a coffee. Well, I can tell the machine, coffee.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.880
It will then find the nearest coffee shop.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.640
Tap it again and it will tell other iReal users

04:27.680 --> 04:31.720
in the area that I'm going for a coffee, ask them if they want to join me.

04:31.760 --> 04:37.440
So I'm now sending the message out to other iReal users, I'm off for coffee.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.000
Come with me.

04:39.040 --> 04:43.280
So you'll have a whole community of futuristic wheelchairs, going around

04:43.320 --> 04:50.360
talking to one another, communicating about one another, like a sort of Stephen Hawking Facebook.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.480
So, there you are.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.120
The future of motoring.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.600
Unless you're fat.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.960
APPLAUSE

05:01.000 --> 05:02.480
Well done, you.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.680
Unfortunately, that means you can't have one, I'm sorry.

05:07.720 --> 05:11.440
What? Because I've got too much dignity? No, fatty, you couldn't fit in it!

05:11.480 --> 05:13.440
I'm not interested.

05:13.480 --> 05:20.280
I'm not bothered about that because Honda has made an even better car, right. Here it is.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.440
Now check that out.What?

05:22.480 --> 05:26.720
How does that work?Well, basically, the silver things kind of

05:26.760 --> 05:32.560
move up and down, and operate your legs, so, for going upstairs, or even walking on level ground.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.160
Now guess who this is aimed at?

05:34.200 --> 05:39.360
Well, I'm guessing people with disabilities, with legs, that's a clever piece of technology.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.120
No, wrong, wrong. It's aimed at the able bodied.But why?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.880
It's the Rotherham Robot.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.600
You don't even have to walk to the chip shop anymore. Now you just go on that.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.120
Well, what's the point in that?No, hang on, no, how fast does it go?

05:52.160 --> 05:55.920
Dunno.I was at school in Rotherham and I could have done with that in cross country.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.560
If you had one of those, mate, I'd love to have the remote control for it.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.400
Captain Blur, look at him go!

06:03.440 --> 06:08.000
Ha ha ha. James, not in the scissor factory, you'll hurt yourself!

06:08.040 --> 06:11.000
Can you kick yourself in the nuts? Yes!

06:11.040 --> 06:13.320
Many times. Bang, bang, bang.

06:13.360 --> 06:18.680
We're definitely going to get you one of those.With a remote control. Yeah. Now.

06:18.720 --> 06:22.360
Geoff Hoon, OK, is the Transport Minister, yes?

06:22.400 --> 06:28.280
And he announced this week he wants to have more average speed cameras on the roads,

06:28.320 --> 06:31.640
because he says they're good for safety and they reduce fuel consumption.

06:31.680 --> 06:37.680
Now this is the same Geoff Hoon who, when he was Defence Secretary, said, and I'm quoting,

06:37.720 --> 06:42.640
"We know that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction."

06:42.680 --> 06:46.560
So he must be right about the speed cameras as well, then.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.880
Yes, absolutely. I tell you what he's done.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.960
Because he claims he goes on the M1 a lot in those roadworks.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.440
You know, around Junction 6, 8, they've been doing them since 1850.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.720
Forever. Yeah. Average speed cameras on that.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.480
And he says, there you are, there's hardly been any accidents.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.320
That's because the roads are jammed up!Not moving.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.560
You can't crash when you're stationary.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.720
Soon, though, we'll have that Tory transport bloke.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.320
Whose name is?Er...

07:16.360 --> 07:18.880
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Theresa Villiers. Who?

07:18.920 --> 07:21.920
Theresa Villiers.That's a funny name for a bloke.Theresa..?

07:21.960 --> 07:24.840
Villiers.Villiers. Tory Transport Secretary.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.240
How can you know that?!

07:26.280 --> 07:27.520
LAUGHTER

07:27.560 --> 07:30.120
He is Theresa whatever.

07:30.160 --> 07:34.400
Because there's only a finite amount of space for information in your head.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.840
So if he's got that in it, what's come out?

07:36.880 --> 07:40.120
How to dress properly?

07:40.160 --> 07:42.760
Well done. Theresa... So actually this man's a woman.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.920
That's fascinating because she hasn't really got any policies across that we've ever seen.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.240
Not that we've heard of.So we've had to come up with some of our own.

07:50.280 --> 07:56.480
A better system than the average speed camera, OK? Look at this.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.760
So, this is real, this is in Denmark.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.200
Loo what they're doing there.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.600
LAUGHTER

08:03.640 --> 08:04.800
It's brilliant.

08:08.560 --> 08:12.160
Give me one good reason why that won't work?

08:12.200 --> 08:15.400
You'd slow down.I'd slow right down.

08:15.440 --> 08:20.120
Once again, Top Gear rides to the rescue of the nation.

08:20.160 --> 08:25.840
Er, what's next, guys?Yes, I want to talk about Aston Martin, brought out a new car, it's the One-77.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.880
Here it is.

08:26.920 --> 08:30.400
It's a striking looking thing, I know. And I think it goes to show

08:30.440 --> 08:33.520
just how in tune with the times Aston Martin are.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.480
It really is a car for the moment.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.679
7.3 litre V12.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.280
Oh, I'm glad about that.

08:39.320 --> 08:44.960
I must get 100 calls a day from people saying, I've got to have at least 7.3 litres and 12 cylinders.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.680
That's what I want right now. Very much of the moment, absolutely.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.080
Price - £1.2 million.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.880
Oh, good thinking(!)

08:52.920 --> 08:59.760
Literally this morning, 30 people called up, "I'm not spending a penny more than 1.2 mill on my next car."

08:59.800 --> 09:02.040
Aston have got it bang on, because as we know, the world

09:02.080 --> 09:06.800
right now is full of stockbrokers desperate for something to blow their enormous bonus on, and there it is.

09:06.840 --> 09:11.480
Pretty soon, Aston Martin are going to be selling more keyrings than they are cars.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.640
Or making more money from them at least.

09:13.680 --> 09:18.720
Actually, they say that 100 potential customers have written to them to express their interest.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.280
A hundred?

09:20.320 --> 09:23.480
Yeah. Written in crayon, I suspect!

09:23.520 --> 09:26.440
Great news.

09:26.480 --> 09:30.840
They've done an off-road version of the Dacia Sandero.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.240
Don't be fooled by the Renault badge. That's the Dacia, that baby.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.480
What the hell are you on about?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.000
It's a Dacia.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.840
It's a Dacia. I know it says Ren... I've just said that.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.920
Have you got a beard in your ears as well?

09:46.080 --> 09:52.080
Why do ginger people always grow more of it on their faces? They don't!They do.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.040
Can I just ask?

09:54.080 --> 09:57.480
You see the show last week, Will Young was the guest.

09:57.520 --> 10:02.480
And I don't know if anybody else noticed, but when he first sat down, Jeremy was not really bothered,

10:02.520 --> 10:05.680
he didn't know his name, didn't know what to talk about.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.960
Next minute, he's going all doe-eyed looking at him, talking...

10:10.000 --> 10:11.520
Talking about interior design.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.640
"Oh, Will, I love cushions as well, I'm having my house done up. Really?

10:15.680 --> 10:18.600
"You had a Mini? They're lovely, Will."

10:18.640 --> 10:20.480
(HE HUMS THE TUNE TO LOVE STORY)

10:22.560 --> 10:24.240
Jeremy's in love!

10:24.280 --> 10:27.120
Are you suggesting Will Young is gay?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.000
Yeah, yeah, he is.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.880
You're kidding!Yes.Is he?

10:32.920 --> 10:34.640
To be honest, it was beautiful to watch.

10:34.680 --> 10:38.160
It's just my gaydar doesn't work as well as yours, obviously.

10:38.200 --> 10:43.000
That jacket. How big was the bet? Pretty big.OK.

10:43.040 --> 10:48.160
I want you to look at this. This is a field of unsold Range Rovers.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.520
Do you know why they're unsold? Nobody's got any money.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.480
No, look at the colours.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.680
That the range of colour that Land Rover does.

10:55.720 --> 11:03.680
Now if you go down to Homebase to paint your walls, you can have any colour you like for a fiver.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.320
Actually you can go in with that jacket, well, maybe not, you could go in with this shirt and

11:07.360 --> 11:12.440
you could say, I want that colour, but a bit more orange, and they'd scan it with a thing.Exactly.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.200
It's just not good enough. Look at this.

11:14.240 --> 11:21.440
What I've got here, is the Audi brochure for the A8, a £70,000 car.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.640
Range of colours available.

11:23.680 --> 11:27.920
There you go.They've printed it in black and white!That's it, OK.

11:27.960 --> 11:35.200
For an extra £2,400, they will paint it in any colour you like, from that chart.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.160
That's just a spectrum.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.960
Yes."Oh, sir wants it in visible light, does he?"

11:41.000 --> 11:44.760
If you want your car in colour, £2,400.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.200
If you want it in black and white. It's just ridiculous.

11:47.240 --> 11:52.200
Well, what you need to do is buy a BMW X5. Because they understand this problem.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.600
They have a special range which they call "BMW Individual,

11:55.640 --> 11:58.360
"the higher your standards, the less room there is for compromise."

11:58.400 --> 12:01.280
As an upshot of that, they offer it in...

12:01.320 --> 12:05.200
Black, silver, silver, and black!

12:05.240 --> 12:08.520
Gentlemen, you're getting all hot under your tweed collars about this.

12:08.560 --> 12:14.400
Can I just say, I know a little bit about this, and the reason that car manufacturers...

12:14.440 --> 12:19.680
They have to plan their paint colours years in advance because they have to test that each colour works

12:19.720 --> 12:25.120
on the plastic of, say, the bumpers, and on the metal of the body, on those two materials...

12:25.160 --> 12:29.000
Rubbish.They do.You say it has to be the same colour whether it's on plastic or metal?Yes.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.480
No, because I was painting my sitting room the other day, and the

12:31.520 --> 12:36.120
paint was exactly the same colour on the wall as it was on the wooden skirting board and on my hand,

12:36.160 --> 12:40.360
and on the sole of my shoe, and subsequently on the stair carpet, all exactly the same colour.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.200
I really want to show you this.

12:43.240 --> 12:48.560
This is the Mercedes CLK. Can you see down here? These are soft-top fabric, OK?

12:48.600 --> 12:52.800
Do you want to know what it says underneath? Cabriolet only.Ah!

12:52.840 --> 12:55.280
I want to have it on my hard top!

12:55.320 --> 13:01.360
Now, in a couple of weeks, James is doing his first ever supercar test out on our track. OK?

13:01.400 --> 13:03.120
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

13:03.160 --> 13:05.840
Now, shall we be honest?

13:05.880 --> 13:10.680
James is not the fastest driver in the world and nor does he have the best sense of direction.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.520
So, before letting him loose on our track in a very fast car,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.200
we thought he should get some training.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.720
So we said to him, "James, go anywhere you like for your training, just not Finland."

13:20.760 --> 13:22.480
Finland.

13:22.520 --> 13:29.920
According to a study by Leicester University, the sixth happiest country in the world.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.240
Finns also top the world league table for coffee drinking,

13:33.280 --> 13:38.760
and they borrow more library books per head than any nation on Earth.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.320
Which is all very interesting.

13:41.360 --> 13:44.920
But it doesn't explain this.

13:46.360 --> 13:51.960
There's a popular saying in motor sport - "If you want to win, employed a Finn."

13:53.840 --> 13:58.840
This sparsely-populated country has produced more rally champions, seven in total,

13:58.880 --> 14:05.360
than any other nation. It has also produced more F1 world champions than anywhere else.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.360
So, what's going on up there?

14:11.400 --> 14:16.680
One of the reasons for Finnish driving prowess must be

14:16.720 --> 14:20.480
quite simply they take driving very, very seriously.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.640
Right from day one.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.480
This is Petkr.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.160
He's not a hoodie in a stolen a car, he's having a driving lesson.

14:30.200 --> 14:35.640
And, like everyone else in Finland, he has to spend six of them on a skid pan.

14:37.240 --> 14:43.680
He will also have lessons driving in the dark, and it will be three years before he gets a full licence.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.360
It's all very strict.

14:49.200 --> 14:53.280
And it needs to be, to be honest, because this is a typical Finnish back road.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.720
It's full of sudden crests and hidden dips.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.120
So as you drive along, you need to know about power on, power off,

14:59.160 --> 15:01.240
feeling the car go light and the grip disappear.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.440
You're going to become a racing driver.

15:05.800 --> 15:09.400
So, to find out how the Finns wrap all this up into one big

15:09.440 --> 15:12.400
bundle of skill, I went for a drive with one of the locals.

15:12.440 --> 15:17.640
Unfortunately, the only person I could find was a retired bloke.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.120
Mind you, he's still quite sprightly.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.760
COMMENTATOR: It's Hakkinen. He's going through the left-hander.

15:31.920 --> 15:35.440
Mika Hakkinen won the F1 World Championship twice,

15:35.480 --> 15:40.880
on both occasions, beating the most successful driver of all time.

15:40.920 --> 15:45.360
Michael Schumacher said you were the only driver he really feared.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.600
(HE LAUGHS)

15:48.600 --> 15:51.480
So where did you learn car control? Because they say the Finns

15:51.520 --> 15:56.240
have an instinct for it that other nations on Earth don't have. You can just do it.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.440
We start doing this sport very, very young.

15:58.480 --> 16:02.160
So automatically we learn car control.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.480
I give you an example. If you put a British person

16:07.520 --> 16:12.760
learning to play cricket when he's 25 years old, it's too late to understand the name of the game.

16:17.160 --> 16:20.080
Are you thinking through these corners or do you just feel it and you know?

16:20.120 --> 16:24.880
No, honestly, what's going on now, we are going really slowly.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.080
Are we?Yeah.

16:29.120 --> 16:34.520
Sitting next to Mika, you get a fantastic demonstration of Finnish car control.

16:34.560 --> 16:38.760
But, if I was to learn more, I couldn't just be a passenger.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.960
Tomorrow, in the interests of science, though probably more

16:45.000 --> 16:50.680
for your entertainment I suspect, the office has entered me in an amateur race on a rally circuit.

16:50.720 --> 16:55.040
Thankfully, though, Mika has offered to train me up.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.880
There's something else about Mika. He's not just helpful.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.280
He's quite modest.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.560
Last year, I went out with Jackie Stewart and he won the

17:14.599 --> 17:20.440
World Championship three times only, instead of just two! Wow!

17:20.480 --> 17:25.640
He taught me to be quite smooth and fast on a Tarmac circuit.

17:25.680 --> 17:29.600
But can you teach me to be Finnish fast on a loose surface, do you think?

17:29.640 --> 17:32.480
I can indeed.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.600
The first and most important thing Mika would teach me

17:35.640 --> 17:39.720
was a cornering move known as the Scandinavian flick.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.080
And because he didn't want his mate's rally car

17:48.120 --> 17:51.880
wrapped around a tree, we started off with some cones.

17:51.920 --> 17:58.720
When we come with the car, how to trace the back end to touching all of these cones to find a perfect slide.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.200
OK, this is how we get the back end around.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.760
Then it was my turn.

18:07.800 --> 18:12.440
A little left, a little right, on the gas, get the back end loose.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.520
That's not enough, is it?

18:19.400 --> 18:21.960
Action!

18:24.080 --> 18:27.000
Better than the first run.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.560
And then, finally...

18:29.600 --> 18:32.880
You did it! You did it!

18:32.920 --> 18:36.880
That's the Finnish way.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.320
After we demolished all his cones, I took Mika out on the proper course.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.280
Which he found relaxing.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.800
A second turn in. A bit of a flick.

18:48.840 --> 18:49.880
That wasn't bad.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.920
Whoa!

18:53.960 --> 18:57.920
Sorry, I forgot which way to go there. OK, third.

18:57.960 --> 19:01.000
And then, with Yoda's guidance...

19:01.040 --> 19:04.160
Now, back end out nicely here. Stay on the gas. Yeah, good.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.600
Beautiful.

19:06.640 --> 19:11.600
..it all came together. Oh-ho, good, excellent.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.840
Lesson over, we stopped for a cup of hot reindeer blood

19:17.880 --> 19:23.120
and talked about why the Finns are so suited to motor sport.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.800
Tell me a bit about Sisu. What's Sisu?

19:26.840 --> 19:29.960
Sisu in English means "courage".

19:30.000 --> 19:33.080
What is to Finns is courage.

19:33.120 --> 19:38.240
Let me give you an example. OK, climbing a tree and jump down from there, so that doesn't mean Sisu.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.800
That is not courage.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.040
That's stupidity.Exactly.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.200
Sisu we can relate very much in motor racing.

19:45.240 --> 19:49.600
For example, you drive a rally car in a forest, extremely really fast,

19:49.640 --> 19:55.800
and you need courage to be able to brake late, to go throttle really early.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.240
Go very close to the apex of the corners.

19:59.280 --> 20:03.400
And also, they're quite reserved, the Finns.

20:03.440 --> 20:07.200
I mean, you, famously, when you were Formula One driving, they'd ask you

20:07.240 --> 20:12.400
a really complicated question, and you'd just say, "yes".Yes. That's right.Yes.

20:12.440 --> 20:16.640
The reason I'm asking you is because I wondered if I might be

20:16.680 --> 20:19.520
in some way a bit Finnish myself.

20:19.560 --> 20:23.800
I don't like noisy people, so does that make me Finnish, do you think?

20:23.840 --> 20:26.880
Yes. At home I quite like to have the

20:26.920 --> 20:33.480
spanners in my tool box in order of size, so that I can always find the right one. Is that quite Finnish?

20:33.520 --> 20:36.520
Yes, it is, very much. Personally, that's what I do.

20:36.560 --> 20:40.240
If you're talking about the tool box, everything has to be very organised.

20:40.280 --> 20:47.040
I quite like to have the air vents on my car all pointing the same way exactly. Is that Finnish?

20:47.080 --> 20:49.840
Er...

20:49.880 --> 20:52.600
No.

20:52.640 --> 20:57.040
The next day it was time for me to mix it with the Finns.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.000
I'd been entered in one of their folk races, which are run on part

21:00.040 --> 21:06.560
Tarmac, part gravel, and take place every weekend, all over Finland.

21:06.600 --> 21:12.160
The Finns had kindly sorted me out with a typical folk racing car.

21:12.200 --> 21:17.320
A 1967 Volvo Amazon.

21:17.360 --> 21:23.640
In actual fact it has 200 hp, but in every other respect, it's scrap.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.320
But there's a very good reason for this.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.240
There's a clever rule in folk racing.

21:27.280 --> 21:32.520
All the cars in the race are given a nominal and equal value, let's say it's 1,000 euros.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.520
Then at the end of the race, you can go to any other competitor and say,

21:35.560 --> 21:39.720
I want to buy your car, and he or she has to sell it to you.

21:39.760 --> 21:45.080
It stops people spending too much money, getting sponsorship and generally taking it too seriously.

21:45.120 --> 21:52.680
It also means that the cars stay equal and the racing stays close, which in turn sharpens the skills.

21:52.720 --> 22:00.320
But frankly, when the other drivers arrived, I stopped worrying about their skills.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.440
The bloke over there is about 85.

22:02.480 --> 22:07.240
And alongside him, the grid featured some housewives...

22:07.280 --> 22:10.120
a child, a teenager...

22:10.160 --> 22:11.640
and Bill Oddie.

22:17.440 --> 22:21.280
Surely this can't be that difficult?

22:21.320 --> 22:24.360
That girl next to me should be doing her maths homework.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.280
Here we go.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.680
By the time we hit the first corner, it was obvious these were

22:35.720 --> 22:41.360
no ordinary pensioners, children, housewives and Bill Oddies.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.080
Ow!

22:44.240 --> 22:46.360
After you, Granddad.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.960
Have a Scandinavian flick, Finnish person!

22:54.000 --> 22:56.560
Damn, damn, I've lost it.

22:56.600 --> 23:04.440
'I'd forgotten what Mika had said, these guys start doing this as soon as they can see over the wheel.'

23:04.480 --> 23:05.960
I'm getting burned.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.200
'I started to fight back.'

23:12.560 --> 23:19.240
I've passed the BMW! That was an overtake on a Finnish person.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.360
She's only 12 but that's not the point.

23:21.400 --> 23:26.520
'But the 12-year-old wasn't having it.'

23:27.920 --> 23:30.120
Oi!

23:35.320 --> 23:38.680
Now normally I'd have been happy to stay there in the nice comfy ditch.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.760
But that's not what Mike would have wanted.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.000
It was time to summon up some Sisu.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.800
I'm going to have the Volvo.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.760
Opportunity for overtaking.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.960
'Using Mika's training, I overtook a housewife.'

24:04.000 --> 24:05.120
Chance for glory.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.960
'And then Granddad.'

24:11.880 --> 24:15.600
'But Bill Oddie was too much for me.'

24:18.000 --> 24:22.360
'And in the end I finished somewhere near the middle.'

24:22.400 --> 24:30.040
I think all my top level Finnish motor sport training has made me exactly average.

24:30.080 --> 24:33.160
But that was average in Finland.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.400
Anywhere else and I'd have been brilliant.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.320
APPLAUSE

24:40.360 --> 24:43.760
Are you ready then for your power time?Yeah.

24:43.800 --> 24:49.800
Let me get this right. To pass your driving test in Finland, you have to be able to powerslide a car?

24:49.840 --> 24:55.400
Absolutely.That's brilliant. But not as brilliant as something I've just thought of.Oh, God.

24:55.440 --> 24:59.840
No, no. We know that nobody is buying V8 cars anymore, OK?

24:59.880 --> 25:04.920
And I find that very sad. I don't want V8s to disappear into the pages of history.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.640
So, how's this for an idea?

25:07.680 --> 25:13.440
If you're not going to use V8s to power cars, how about using them to power something else?

25:13.480 --> 25:16.280
Like, for instance, a food blender?

25:16.320 --> 25:18.440
This is what I've got here in essence.

25:18.480 --> 25:23.320
This is the 6.2 litre engine that you would normally put in a Corvette.

25:23.360 --> 25:26.000
I see no reason why you couldn't put it in a kitchen.

25:26.040 --> 25:31.440
So, here it is. There's the drive shaft going under the petrol tank into the kitchen cabinet.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.760
You'll have to take out the wedding presents, the fondue sets you don't want.

25:34.800 --> 25:41.600
Because, in here, you've got the diff, which then sends the drive shaft up here, and into the blender.

25:41.640 --> 25:45.600
Very good. So what can you blend with it? I could blend you if I wanted to.

25:45.640 --> 25:52.600
What I'm actually going to do, under this high visibility shield here, is blend some beef.

25:52.640 --> 26:00.000
Beef?Beef, yes, beef. This is going to be a man's V8 smoothie that I'm going to make now.

26:00.040 --> 26:03.240
So I'm going to plonk that in there like that.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.800
Does that still have bones in it?

26:04.840 --> 26:07.000
Yes. And then...

26:07.040 --> 26:08.800
I'm going to put some chillies in.

26:08.840 --> 26:13.080
This is Bovril. Because that's a V8 man's drink.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.800
That's a collection of manly ingredients.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.160
Yeah, haven't finished yet. Tabasco. Nice touch.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.840
That wasn't...Just a dash

26:24.880 --> 26:31.240
of that in there. And I think, for added bite, a brick.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.800
It is actually a brick.

26:32.840 --> 26:36.120
Oh, it's broken, but there we are. Pop that in there. Now we pop the lid on.

26:36.160 --> 26:40.120
Perhaps you could give me a hand with this, Hammond. Because it's quite complicated.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.480
Yes, I'm the practical man.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.680
Those go on here like that. So we do it up.

26:44.720 --> 26:49.240
Is this going to work, or is the top going to come off and we'll have a really hard time explaining

26:49.280 --> 26:52.800
to the ambulance people how he's got beef bone antlers stuck in his head?

26:52.840 --> 26:54.640
Just worried.Relax.

26:54.680 --> 27:00.320
Yeah, relax when you've got the keys to a V8 blender.Right.

27:00.360 --> 27:05.440
This is the controls.Oh, God, tell me that's not an accelerator pedal! Yes.

27:07.320 --> 27:10.200
Safety precautions.

27:12.520 --> 27:14.480
Is it loud?

27:14.520 --> 27:17.840
Is it loud, James? Of course it's loud. Are we ready?

27:17.880 --> 27:21.240
Here we go! This is in the kitchen at home, yeah?

27:21.280 --> 27:23.520
MOTOR REVS EXTREMELY LOUDLY

27:39.080 --> 27:41.040
It does make a bit of a racket.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.040
CHEERING AND WHISTLES

27:46.560 --> 27:47.800
Some of it came out.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.560
Yeah, some of it did.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.520
Actually, on the noise, we're used to vacuum cleaners and things at home,

27:53.560 --> 27:55.720
so I think you'd grow accustomed to that after a while.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.560
The thing is, what I'd like to do is,

27:57.600 --> 28:02.320
whenever my wife puts the Archers on, which she does roundabout 7pm, I'd fire up my food blender.

28:02.360 --> 28:05.560
Nice.Can you get the thing off? I'll prepare the glasses.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.760
So this is like a manly smoothie cocktail?

28:08.800 --> 28:10.600
Exactly.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.760
This is the moment.Yes, yes!

28:12.800 --> 28:14.320
Look at that!

28:14.360 --> 28:18.960
That just is the business!Fantastic.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.520
And delicious. Right, are we ready?

28:21.560 --> 28:24.560
What a creation.Hmm. Here we go.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.160
Get some of the bits. It needs a name.

28:26.200 --> 28:30.360
We should give it a name. We should call it, um, Desperate Shag In A Skip.

28:33.120 --> 28:36.120
Try some of that.A Quick One Round The Back Of The Dustcart.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.640
AUDIENCE GASP AND THEN LAUGH

28:51.960 --> 28:53.520
I think he likes it.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.400
I've got the name for it.What?

28:55.440 --> 28:57.080
The Bloody Awful.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.680
Have you tried it?Yeah.

28:59.720 --> 29:02.960
You haven't. Have you?Yes.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.320
Show me. Put it in your mouth. Because that will put...

29:05.360 --> 29:08.080
AUDIENCE GROAN

29:08.120 --> 29:10.320
That will put testes on your chest, that will.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.000
It's put hairs on my eyeballs.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.960
I'm not sure this works.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.720
Look.

29:17.760 --> 29:23.880
I'm not giving up with this V8 idea, OK? Next week, old people.

29:23.920 --> 29:27.200
You can't blend old people.No, you know the Stannah stairlift?

29:27.240 --> 29:30.880
Very slow. How about a V8 Stannah stairlift?

29:30.920 --> 29:34.920
The old lady, she'll be on the bog in half a second.Yeah, that's it.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.280
So I'll get working on that. But that's then.

29:37.320 --> 29:41.560
This is now, and it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

29:41.600 --> 29:45.520
Now my guest tonight has had an extraordinary life.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.200
He's nicked a load of gold from the Iraqis.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.960
He's nicked gold from the Italians.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.840
He's shot Matt Damon in the face.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.000
He's died when his trawler sank in a storm.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.800
And he's had a very enormous penis.

29:57.840 --> 29:58.840
LAUGHTER

29:58.880 --> 30:01.760
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mark Wahlberg!

30:01.800 --> 30:04.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:05.120 --> 30:06.200
How are you?

30:08.400 --> 30:09.920
How are you?Good.Have a seat.

30:19.040 --> 30:24.120
Mark, don't drink that. Don't...! Don't put it in your mouth!

30:24.160 --> 30:27.160
It's brick and beef. It's not gone well!

30:27.200 --> 30:30.960
I've got a couple of questions. It's very rare we get big American actors.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.400
It's because Ross isn't around at the moment, so you're here.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.600
LAUGHTER

30:38.160 --> 30:40.720
I was on that show with Andrew Lloyd Webber.

30:40.760 --> 30:46.560
His face is on inside-out, have you noticed?It's so weird. It's my second encounter with him.

30:46.600 --> 30:51.240
The first time I saw him, I was at a heliport, going to Birmingham with George Clooney,

30:51.280 --> 30:55.800
and George Clooney goes up and tells him, "Mark Wahlberg's over there, he's a huge fan."

30:55.840 --> 30:59.360
He comes over, talking to me for half an hour. I didn't know who he was!

30:59.400 --> 31:00.560
LAUGHTER

31:00.600 --> 31:04.720
I was like, you know, "Phantom of the Opera? What is that?"

31:04.760 --> 31:07.360
He's never done any rap songs. No hip hop.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.200
He's not really from the hood!

31:10.960 --> 31:15.320
The new film. I want to talk to you about that, if I may, Max Payne.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.360
What's it about?

31:16.400 --> 31:21.240
I play a homicide cop, the title character, whose wife and child are brutally murdered.

31:21.280 --> 31:26.200
And I basically get to go and destroy everyone else that's responsible, even remotely.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.840
It's an edge-of-the-seat proper action movie.

31:28.880 --> 31:32.600
A Sunday-afternoon, relaxing, fighty film, which is what you need.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.400
We've got a clip of it.

31:34.440 --> 31:38.280
This is Jim Bravura. What unit is responding to the exit call?

31:39.680 --> 31:41.800
You mean nobody's called anything in yet?!

31:41.840 --> 31:44.160
'Would you like to report something?'Yes!

32:04.400 --> 32:06.000
We need to come in, now!

32:06.040 --> 32:08.760
Not a chance!Clear!

32:15.560 --> 32:17.040
He's gone!

32:17.080 --> 32:18.200
Great job, boys(!)

32:18.240 --> 32:22.840
You see what you did? You let him get away. Everybody's going to get a medal for this - great(!)

32:24.480 --> 32:27.120
APPLAUSE

32:27.160 --> 32:31.600
It's not an adaptation of a Jane Austen book, is it?No, this is not.

32:31.640 --> 32:37.880
This is the real deal, working with John, who is definitely one of the best action directors out there.

32:37.920 --> 32:41.320
He really pushed the envelope. He's here. John Moore.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.880
He's The Stig.He is not The Stig.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.960
He is The Stig!

32:46.000 --> 32:48.200
Not unless he can pump himself up!

32:48.240 --> 32:51.880
Next question I've got, and this is an important one, OK?

32:51.920 --> 32:56.960
There's a girl in this Max Payne movie who's called Olga Kurylenko.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.880
Yes, the new Bond girl.

32:58.920 --> 33:04.920
She's in that Bond film, and James Bond doesn't do having sex with her.

33:04.960 --> 33:12.720
In Max Payne, she's lying in your bed, wearing, let's be honest, not much, and you go, "Oh, no."

33:12.760 --> 33:16.920
Why? Have we got a picture of her? I want you to see what these guys... This is her.

33:16.960 --> 33:20.600
Has she got a beard or something? LAUGHTER

33:20.640 --> 33:27.600
Another John Moore question, because we could have easily shot the sex scene and not put it in the movie!

33:27.640 --> 33:29.320
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

33:29.360 --> 33:32.280
There's many other scenes

33:32.320 --> 33:35.400
that ended up on the editing room floor!

33:37.160 --> 33:42.720
Are you the first action hero ever to have a side parting, here?

34:15.260 --> 34:19.219
Obviously, you know, Michael Caine. So it was a big deal coming over here.

34:19.260 --> 34:22.460
We wanted to make sure we could make a really cool movie.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.699
To be honest, I thought it was a very cool movie.

34:24.739 --> 34:27.340
I've heard there'll be a sequel to The Italian Job?

34:27.380 --> 34:30.219
They've been trying to make a sequel for quite some time.

34:30.260 --> 34:34.580
I don't want to do it for the sake of it. If we can't make it better, I don't want to do it.

34:34.620 --> 34:37.100
They haven't been able to get the script in shape.

34:37.139 --> 34:38.659
The worrying thing is the title.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.540
The Brazilian Job?You see...

34:40.580 --> 34:42.460
LAUGHTER

34:44.020 --> 34:45.540
Does that translate?

34:45.580 --> 34:49.820
That's a you know what...Yes. Have you got one?No.

34:49.860 --> 34:53.500
You've got one?!Oh, I thought you were asking me!

34:53.540 --> 34:55.139
Come on up here!

34:55.179 --> 34:58.860
What's the most enjoyable film you've worked on, excluding Max Payne?

34:58.900 --> 35:01.900
Probably The Departed.

35:01.940 --> 35:06.660
The talent in that one. There's you, DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon...

35:06.700 --> 35:10.180
..Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen. What made it so much fun?

35:10.220 --> 35:12.540
Because it was my neck of the woods.

35:12.580 --> 35:16.580
I've had a lot of experience with the Boston Police Department!

35:16.620 --> 35:17.860
LAUGHTER

35:17.900 --> 35:21.060
And finally being able to put all that to good use, you know,

35:21.100 --> 35:26.100
playing a cop instead of being arrested by them, was fun.

35:26.140 --> 35:29.860
You did have... How can I phrase this? A wild...

35:29.900 --> 35:32.740
A wild upbringing, shall we say? Is that fair enough?Yes.

35:32.780 --> 35:36.940
Yes.Let's put it like this. Your first cars, you didn't buy them.

35:36.980 --> 35:39.020
Not all of them.

35:39.060 --> 35:42.740
Actually, the first one that I kind of owned, I bought from a friend.

35:42.780 --> 35:46.460
I was 13 years old, I didn't have a licence. I wasn't registered insured.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.900
But I stole quite a few cars in my day.

35:48.940 --> 35:52.260
Did you steal the same guy's car a few...?I did. He was...

35:52.300 --> 35:54.220
How many times did you steal his car?

35:54.260 --> 35:57.020
Probably, like, 10 or 15.

35:57.060 --> 35:59.980
I'd drive around, he'd find it or the cops would find it,

36:00.020 --> 36:02.820
bring it back, I'd walk down the street, jump in the car,

36:02.860 --> 36:05.540
pinch the window, unlock it and jump back in and start it.

36:05.580 --> 36:10.460
He'd come running outside, chasing me. I'd be like, "Hey,BLEEPyou! See you later!"

36:10.500 --> 36:13.060
I want to apologise. I probably cost him heartache.

36:13.100 --> 36:16.300
He probably missed work because I went joyriding in his car.

36:50.340 --> 36:55.660
You're what we call a petrolhead. I don't know what you call them over there? Rivetheads?

36:55.700 --> 36:58.380
Gearhead.Gearhead. That's what I was looking for.

36:58.420 --> 37:00.420
Your cars have been good,

37:00.460 --> 37:04.420
looking back through the history. What was the first one? SL Mercedes?

37:04.460 --> 37:08.220
Yeah, a brand-new car, that was the first one I bought.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.940
And now you have...?A Maybach.

37:09.980 --> 37:11.700
The big one, 62 inch.

37:11.740 --> 37:13.740
LAUGHTER

37:13.780 --> 37:16.500
On purpose, or was it in a cereal packet or something?

37:16.540 --> 37:18.220
LAUGHTER

37:18.260 --> 37:21.740
And then I have a Brabus Mercedes 550.

37:21.780 --> 37:23.060
Tom Cruise is a Brabus fan.

37:23.100 --> 37:25.140
I don't know.Do you not know him?

37:25.180 --> 37:27.260
We attend different churches, so I don't.

37:27.300 --> 37:28.900
LAUGHTER

37:30.100 --> 37:32.380
APPLAUSE

37:35.580 --> 37:38.220
I'm at the one with Jesus, baby!

37:38.260 --> 37:44.380
You came down here, presumably, utterly bewildered that there's a bleak airstrip in the middle

37:44.420 --> 37:47.540
of England with a man who won't take his helmet off called Stig,

37:47.580 --> 37:51.340
who takes you out in a not-very-exciting car with the steering wheel

37:51.380 --> 37:54.820
on the wrong side and a lever sticking up out of the floor.

37:54.860 --> 37:57.900
Did that baffle you, by the way, the lever?It did. What was that?

37:57.940 --> 37:59.580
LAUGHTER

37:59.620 --> 38:06.620
Is that why you didn't treat our car quite as well as, let's say, other people treated it?I'm sorry.

38:06.660 --> 38:10.460
Did you break our car? Ibroke a couple of them, I think.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.620
I heard! There's a cameraman over there,

38:12.660 --> 38:14.340
and some poo came out of him.

38:14.380 --> 38:15.780
LAUGHTER

38:15.820 --> 38:18.100
The crazy thing is, I went so far off the track,

38:18.140 --> 38:20.980
and then next time around, he was in that same exact spot.

38:21.020 --> 38:22.460
I thought, "He's got balls!"

38:22.500 --> 38:23.740
LAUGHTER

38:23.780 --> 38:26.060
I'd just like to see... Go on, sorry.

38:26.100 --> 38:29.620
I'm just glad this isn't how I make my living, because I would be broke!

38:29.660 --> 38:31.940
We don't know. Shall we have a look at the lap?

38:31.980 --> 38:33.740
AUDIENCE:Yeah! Let's play the tape.

38:33.780 --> 38:35.660
'Here we go!

38:35.700 --> 38:37.500
'That's an aggressive start!'

38:37.540 --> 38:38.700
LAUGHTER

38:38.740 --> 38:44.500
'Bloody hell! That's aggressively turned there! And there!'

38:45.540 --> 38:51.260
This is a hunk of crap. 'That's... You've gone mad!'

38:52.300 --> 38:55.260
You've got balls, standing there!

38:58.700 --> 39:01.380
'That's cutting the corner, and that's cutting...

39:01.420 --> 39:02.860
'Is he going to kill this one?

39:02.900 --> 39:05.060
'Were you just aiming for the cameraman?'

39:05.100 --> 39:09.980
ENGLISH ACCENT: Here we are on a race track in the UK, Mark Wahlberg.

39:10.020 --> 39:13.500
'That's Jason Statham, who it actually is!

39:13.540 --> 39:17.300
'That was quick. Close to the tyres, yes! Move those!

39:17.340 --> 39:20.740
'Not quite so quick there, but that's a good line.

39:20.780 --> 39:22.220
'That's not bad.

39:22.260 --> 39:27.380
'Coming up to Michael Gambon corner, and we are across the line!'

39:27.420 --> 39:29.340
APPLAUSE

39:32.820 --> 39:35.260
This is the board.

39:35.300 --> 39:40.500
Since we've had that car, these are the people, most of whom you won't have a clue who they are.

39:40.540 --> 39:43.940
I don't know any of them, really.

39:43.980 --> 39:46.660
Well, you know him, Simon Cowell?

39:46.700 --> 39:50.580
Ray Winstone, I worked with him.Ray Winstone, obviously, The Departed.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.700
Brian Cox.

39:52.740 --> 39:56.460
Yes, he was really dreadful. You want to beat Brian Cox?Yeah.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.660
I've got the time here.

40:00.340 --> 40:02.940
You did it. It was a mad lap, got to be honest.

40:02.980 --> 40:05.380
Super aggressive. You did it...

40:06.820 --> 40:07.820
..in 1...

40:07.860 --> 40:10.700
So you're better than Brian Cox!

40:10.740 --> 40:13.740
..48.7.

40:13.780 --> 40:17.660
So he's under the 1:50, give him a round of applause.

40:17.700 --> 40:19.420
APPLAUSE

40:22.380 --> 40:25.780
That's not bad. Somewhere in the middle.That's very good.

40:25.820 --> 40:28.220
The steering wheel was on the correct side...

40:28.260 --> 40:31.660
That's really good, and it's been an absolute joy to have you here.

40:31.700 --> 40:34.100
Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Wahlberg!

40:34.140 --> 40:37.220
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

40:40.060 --> 40:46.700
Now, in these dark and difficult times, very few people can afford a Mitsubishi Evo.

40:46.740 --> 40:50.100
Even the base model, the 300, is the best part of 30 grand.

40:50.140 --> 40:53.540
However, the other evening, we decided...In the pub...

40:53.580 --> 40:57.060
Some beer helped us to realise that whatever car you've got, you can

40:57.100 --> 41:01.620
make it as fast as an Evo X, and at a fraction of the cost.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.900
The producers said that sounded like a challenge for us,

41:04.940 --> 41:09.180
so they said they would provide some sort of car, then we'd have two days to modify it

41:09.220 --> 41:14.500
and try and make it faster round our track than a Mitsubishi Evo X. We were very excited about this,

41:14.540 --> 41:19.780
as you can see from the way Jeremy arrives in someone else's Aston Martin.

41:25.300 --> 41:30.100
'The three of us turned up on day one, not knowing what car the producers had bought.'

41:32.860 --> 41:36.740
I reckon it'll be something like a Focus, but a really small-engine one.

41:44.870 --> 41:49.030
We can't start with something like that and get it that fast - it'll be...

41:49.070 --> 41:50.750
Have you met our producers?!Yes.

41:50.790 --> 41:55.110
When was the last time they said, "Here's a job for you, and we've made it easy"?Never.

41:55.150 --> 41:56.390
They're not going to now.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.670
It'll be something...

42:04.350 --> 42:08.110
It's not a Ferrari F430.It's not.

42:14.390 --> 42:15.430
Here we go.

42:18.590 --> 42:19.590
It is...

42:19.630 --> 42:22.510
What that is is a Renault Avantime.

42:22.550 --> 42:24.870
I wasn't expecting that.

42:26.910 --> 42:30.790
Introduced in 2002, the Avantime was a monumental failure.

42:30.830 --> 42:37.710
Only 435 were sold in Britain before it was dropped from the price list after just 18 months.

42:40.310 --> 42:44.230
Weirdly, it's one of the few cars ever made that us three all like.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.470
Right, so cars that we all like.

42:46.510 --> 42:48.030
This.Yes.

42:48.070 --> 42:50.750
Ford Mondeo.Good one.

42:50.790 --> 42:53.230
This.Subaru Legacy.Yes.

42:53.270 --> 42:58.070
Yes.It's not a big list!That's it!

43:01.990 --> 43:07.910
The most impressive thing in the whole car is just, there's more air in here than there is in Montana.

43:07.950 --> 43:09.550
It's very spacious!

43:09.590 --> 43:13.270
Let's just have a systems check on everything. Heated rear window works.

43:13.310 --> 43:17.230
Heated seats works. All lights working in the back?

43:17.270 --> 43:20.710
I have a selection of lights working.

43:20.750 --> 43:24.950
This is six years old and everything works, which is odd, because most Renaults...

43:24.990 --> 43:26.630
Six minutes.

43:28.230 --> 43:31.790
Then there's the Avantime's party piece. Give it a whirl.

43:31.830 --> 43:34.310
Oh, yeah!

43:34.350 --> 43:36.430
I'm outside!

43:36.470 --> 43:38.310
Look at this!

43:38.350 --> 43:43.110
This is what it's like being a dog. And there's more cleverness. Look at this.

43:43.150 --> 43:48.350
To make getting into the back easier, the doors were very, very long.

43:48.390 --> 43:52.430
You'd imagine that'd make it useless in car parks, but no, they fitted it with

43:52.470 --> 43:59.750
clever double hinges that they called kinematic, and look, in a gap that big, wide open. Very clever.

44:02.070 --> 44:06.390
This was a very intelligent, very unusual and very comfortable car.

44:06.430 --> 44:10.590
However, while it can turn heads, it struggles to turn corners...

44:10.630 --> 44:13.310
Ease it round here. Check it out!

44:13.350 --> 44:15.790
..as The Stig will now demonstrate.

44:18.910 --> 44:21.030
Three, two, one, hit it!

44:25.430 --> 44:29.150
Even though that's the top-of-the-range model, the Privilege, had a

44:29.190 --> 44:34.590
three-litre V6, know what the nought to 60 was? Nine seconds. What's an Evo? 4.5?

44:34.630 --> 44:36.430
It's about twice as long.

44:38.750 --> 44:43.550
Andthe suspension is for ironing out bumps, not smashing them down with a steel fist.

44:43.590 --> 44:46.190
Not designed to corner level and flat.

44:46.230 --> 44:50.430
Of course, we knew this front-wheel-drive box would be nowhere

44:50.470 --> 44:53.070
near as fast as an Evo round our track.

44:53.110 --> 44:56.870
But we didn't realise how nowhere near.

44:58.510 --> 45:00.430
Go on.

45:00.470 --> 45:02.190
This is the size of the challenge.

45:02.230 --> 45:06.790
What was the Evo?1:28.2.

45:06.830 --> 45:09.830
1:42.5.

45:09.870 --> 45:14.950
The Avantime was more than 14 seconds slower.

45:14.990 --> 45:17.350
Then, things got worse.

45:17.390 --> 45:22.670
"You know you have two days to make your modifications, so now you need to know the budget.

45:22.710 --> 45:26.590
"A Mitsubishi Evo X costs £30,000.

45:26.630 --> 45:31.270
"You can spend half of that to make the Avantime as fast."

45:31.310 --> 45:33.150
That's not bad, actually.15,000?

45:33.190 --> 45:35.590
We could do loads with that. There's more.

45:35.630 --> 45:42.630
"£5,200 was spent on buying the car itself, so you have £9,800 left."

45:42.670 --> 45:44.790
How much do they spend in Formula One?

45:44.830 --> 45:49.910
They say that, to cut a second a lap, it's £10 million.

45:49.950 --> 45:51.910
So we need £140 million.

45:51.950 --> 45:53.670
Is there anything behind it?

45:53.710 --> 45:55.470
Just James, don't worry.

45:55.510 --> 46:03.390
With a lot less than that, we backed the car into a borrowed workshop, and immediately ran into a problem.

46:03.430 --> 46:06.990
There's a... How do you make it do it?

46:07.030 --> 46:09.430
Where's the thing?

46:09.470 --> 46:11.390
Shall I get a hammer? No, there it is.

46:11.430 --> 46:13.830
No, it isn't. That's where the spring is.

46:13.870 --> 46:15.150
It is it.

46:15.190 --> 46:22.910
'Eventually, we got the bonnet up, and then immediately decided to have an argument.'

46:20.950 --> 46:23.950
Look, guys, power.

46:23.990 --> 46:25.870
Power is everything.

46:25.910 --> 46:28.830
There's other stuff to deal with before we get to power.

46:28.870 --> 46:30.630
The way it handles, the way it drives.

46:30.670 --> 46:32.350
Why don't we just put nitrous on it?

46:32.390 --> 46:34.510
Remember what happened to the first Stig?

46:34.550 --> 46:38.510
He fell off an aircraft carrier. Yeah, we used nitrous.

46:38.550 --> 46:42.590
Right, cornering is where it matters. We know from the track.

46:42.630 --> 46:43.790
Look at the lap board.

46:43.830 --> 46:48.150
The Lotus Exige, not a particularly powerful car, goes quickly because it goes

46:48.190 --> 46:53.470
round corners quickly. GT Mustang, loads of power, slow, because they won't go round corners quickly.

46:53.510 --> 46:57.870
That's more important than power. Where do we start?Brakes.

46:57.910 --> 47:01.230
James insisted on buying new ones.

47:02.270 --> 47:06.230
This is the standard front disc of the Avantime.

47:06.270 --> 47:09.110
This is the one we're proposing to put on.

47:09.150 --> 47:12.870
Bigger area, vented, keep it cool, make it more efficient.

47:12.910 --> 47:20.430
'For sure, all this would mean The Stig could break later into the corners, but there was a downside.'

47:20.470 --> 47:23.470
How much do these brakes cost?

47:23.510 --> 47:27.150
£3,000.£3,000?

47:27.190 --> 47:31.190
We've used nearly a third of our budget on the brakes?

47:31.230 --> 47:33.910
It'll make a difference. Most important thing to do.

47:33.950 --> 47:37.470
'While I wasn't helping, something began to worry me.'

47:37.510 --> 47:40.950
Any minute now, Monkey and Wrench over there

47:40.990 --> 47:45.550
are going to realise they've made a catastrophic mistake.

47:45.590 --> 47:47.470
Hang on.

47:49.150 --> 47:52.310
The callipers are too big for the wheels.

47:52.350 --> 47:53.630
Ugh!

47:54.110 --> 47:59.190
'So we had to blow more of our budget on bigger wheels and tyres.'

47:59.230 --> 48:01.870
How much were they?A lot.

48:01.910 --> 48:03.590
£600.

48:06.830 --> 48:09.670
'As The Stig was inserted in for another lap,

48:09.710 --> 48:13.830
'James and Richard were convinced it was money well spent.

48:21.950 --> 48:25.310
We have learned from our racing experience, which we all share, and

48:25.350 --> 48:27.790
we have applied it to this, and we have improved.

48:29.350 --> 48:32.470
41, 42...

48:34.710 --> 48:35.950
What?

48:35.990 --> 48:39.430
What was it?1:42.5.

48:41.670 --> 48:46.670
Is it broken or something? He's gone 2.1 seconds slower.

48:48.510 --> 48:52.910
'This was baffling. We decided we had bought the wrong tyres.

48:52.950 --> 48:56.630
'So we spent another 600quid on better ones.'

48:56.670 --> 49:01.750
We've got some road-legal but very sticky track tyres.

49:01.790 --> 49:05.790
Which could be worth several seconds.

49:12.710 --> 49:13.710
BLEEP!

49:18.430 --> 49:21.510
'The new rubber was sure to get us going in the right direction.'

49:21.550 --> 49:25.470
If he can brake later and has more grip in the corners, he can get power sooner.

49:25.510 --> 49:27.670
Better tyres will enable the brakes to work.

49:27.710 --> 49:31.950
15 seconds, this'll be. The one thing I know about is tyres.

49:36.390 --> 49:40.790
1:42.7.

49:40.830 --> 49:44.190
So, with better brakes and better tyres we are travelling...

49:44.230 --> 49:46.990
0.2 of a second slower than we were originally.

49:47.030 --> 49:48.590
This doesn't make sense!

49:48.630 --> 49:50.750
How does motor racing work?

49:50.790 --> 49:52.390
We could try another driver.

49:55.150 --> 49:59.870
'Having blown half our money and got nowhere, we decided we should

49:59.910 --> 50:04.310
'spend a massive £2,000 on some new suspension.'

50:05.350 --> 50:07.710
Hang on, Stig's still in it!

50:07.750 --> 50:09.870
We haven't got time to get him out!

50:09.910 --> 50:12.310
'Fitting the new suspension was a job for James and

50:12.350 --> 50:15.470
'the boffins from the Top Gear technology centre,

50:15.510 --> 50:18.430
'which left Jeremy and me looking for something to do.'

50:18.470 --> 50:20.430
HE MUMBLES

50:20.470 --> 50:21.710
What?

50:21.750 --> 50:23.230
Shouldn't we lighten it?

50:23.270 --> 50:26.310
What do you want to take out?

50:26.350 --> 50:28.110
Seats. Take out just the back seats.

50:28.150 --> 50:30.430
No, cos then it's a two-seater.

50:31.630 --> 50:33.230
'Hammond, though, was right.'

50:33.270 --> 50:37.590
Just feel this. That's how much we've lost.You bugger!

50:37.630 --> 50:39.830
Yeah, that's...heavier!

50:41.510 --> 50:47.310
The amount of fuel needed just to move an electric heated seat...

50:47.350 --> 50:50.230
That would cost you a noticeable number of quid a month.

50:51.350 --> 50:54.670
'In order to keep the Avantime as a family car, we borrowed two race

50:54.710 --> 51:00.430
'seats from our 24-hour BMW racer and two from Hammond's stretched MG.

51:00.470 --> 51:03.070
'Then we set about replacing the heavy glass roof.'

51:03.110 --> 51:06.550
It's four and a half hammers across.

51:09.110 --> 51:13.990
'With our weight-shedding completed, I went to ask James about his suspension.

51:14.030 --> 51:15.790
'Which was a mistake.'

51:15.830 --> 51:20.430
The springs are stiffer and the dampers can be adjusted so the compression rebound changes.

51:20.470 --> 51:25.670
If you alter that very finely, you can keep the tyre in contact with the road more of the time.

51:25.710 --> 51:29.230
If the weight goes off or tyre bounces up, you lose grip, which lowers

51:29.270 --> 51:32.630
your cornering speed and you know that cars are faster... You asked!

51:32.670 --> 51:36.070
'With the car now lighter, lower, firmer, grippier

51:36.110 --> 51:40.110
'and fitted with better brakes, it was time for another lap.'

51:40.150 --> 51:41.750
Go!

51:41.790 --> 51:45.270
'It was now almost the end of our first day,

51:45.310 --> 51:49.230
'and we had to have something to show for all our effort.'

51:49.270 --> 51:50.390
Come on, Stiggy.

51:52.030 --> 51:53.430
Cornering flat.

51:55.110 --> 51:57.870
He's better. This is faster.

52:00.190 --> 52:02.510
Come on, come on!

52:02.550 --> 52:06.350
Ooh!1:38.2.

52:06.390 --> 52:09.430
Which means we're exactly 10 seconds away from our target.

52:11.430 --> 52:15.470
I suppose at this point you two will kill me if I say power.

52:15.510 --> 52:17.630
I dunno, what are you saying? Let's see.

52:17.670 --> 52:19.030
No, look...

52:19.070 --> 52:22.150
James, just old-fashioned tuning.

52:22.190 --> 52:28.070
Cylinder heads, camshafts, inlet manifolds. You can get filthy dirty.

52:28.110 --> 52:30.430
Think of that! An all-nighter in the workshop!

52:30.470 --> 52:34.550
All those bolts you could name and line up. We won't interfere.

52:34.590 --> 52:38.390
Put spanners back in order!And I promise, we wouldn't cock about.

52:38.430 --> 52:40.990
We would do everything you asked us to do. I promise.

52:41.030 --> 52:43.110
Anything?Anything.

52:43.150 --> 52:47.430
Including leaving the workshop and not coming back until I finished?

52:47.470 --> 52:50.990
Just leaving you alone all through the night. Can I have a bag of chips?

52:51.030 --> 52:52.790
Yes, I'll buy you a bag of chips.

52:55.110 --> 52:57.030
All right.Yes!

52:58.950 --> 53:02.390
'Before James set about his all-nighter,

53:02.430 --> 53:07.070
'we put the Avantime on a rolling road to see how much power it was

53:07.110 --> 53:12.510
'producing after six years of hard graft.'That's astonishing.

53:12.550 --> 53:14.230
That is astonishing, actually.

53:14.270 --> 53:15.990
Are you sure that's right?Yep.

53:16.030 --> 53:21.790
It started with 210. It's now got 157, as it turns out.

53:21.830 --> 53:25.470
All our figures so far have been gained with about 150 horsepower.

53:25.510 --> 53:29.310
We should be able to get it up to 210 with just, effectively, a good service.

53:31.270 --> 53:37.150
'So, we filled James up with chips and left him to it.'

53:43.590 --> 53:49.510
'Come the dawn, the engine had a new air filter, new injectors and a new inlet manifold.

53:55.510 --> 53:59.350
'Once more, the Avantime went on a rolling road.'

53:59.390 --> 54:01.150
Is that the HP?Woah!

54:01.190 --> 54:04.630
That is 206, is it?206?!

54:08.430 --> 54:13.870
'Hopefully, with all this shiny new power, our Avantime would fly.'

54:13.910 --> 54:15.870
Listen to that power!

54:17.270 --> 54:20.110
Some of your heart and soul's in that car.

54:20.150 --> 54:25.030
We really are a bit stumped after this, because how much money have we got left?Only 300 quid.

54:28.670 --> 54:30.230
Here he comes.

54:34.150 --> 54:35.670
1:36.20.

54:35.710 --> 54:37.710
Wow, all night!

54:37.750 --> 54:40.030
And your face and...

54:40.070 --> 54:42.710
Is there anything more to come out of that engine?

54:42.750 --> 54:45.310
No, because I think the gearbox will just break.

54:45.350 --> 54:47.110
Aerodynamics.

54:47.150 --> 54:49.190
Did you say you bought a spoiler?

54:49.230 --> 54:51.910
At a charity auction, yes. What sort of spoiler?

54:51.950 --> 54:55.990
A Formula One one.Well, it is a spoiler. He has a point. It's a spoiler.

54:56.030 --> 54:59.270
Fetch the spoiler!Let's see.

55:00.950 --> 55:05.350
'Once it was on, though, James and I had our doubts.'

55:06.390 --> 55:08.630
Look, spoilers make things go faster.

55:08.670 --> 55:12.550
Fact. F1 Cars have spoilers on, they go like the clappers, ergo, success.

55:12.590 --> 55:17.630
Among your friends with their baseball caps in Cheltenham, that is

55:17.670 --> 55:20.590
a generally-held belief. If you think it's going to

55:20.630 --> 55:26.830
push down onto the rear wheels, and this is a front-wheel drive car...

55:31.190 --> 55:35.990
I think the word is...optimistic. I think the word is...ridiculous.

55:37.190 --> 55:41.110
'Nonsense! This would be the final piece in the jigsaw.'

55:44.030 --> 55:47.590
Yeah! 1:35...An hour of your life.

55:47.630 --> 55:52.110
1:37.03.

55:52.150 --> 55:55.710
Nearly a second added by the spoiler.

55:55.750 --> 56:02.150
'However, while Hammond's spoiler was a dead loss, it did give me an idea.'

56:02.190 --> 56:07.230
Remember when we did the brick car race and we had that splitter on the front?

56:07.270 --> 56:10.350
When it fell off, we were two seconds a lap slower.

56:10.390 --> 56:13.070
It made a big difference.

56:13.110 --> 56:14.630
Why don't we put a splitter on?

56:15.390 --> 56:20.590
'In theory, a well-designed splitter erases understeer, but ours wouldn't be well designed

56:20.630 --> 56:24.190
'because Jeremy insisted he'd make it out of wood.

56:31.070 --> 56:32.870
'So, it had come to this.

56:33.870 --> 56:39.150
'All our hopes now rested on Jeremy's carpentry.'

56:39.190 --> 56:44.150
That plywood has, in essence, on this lap, got to take off

56:44.190 --> 56:46.270
eight and a bit seconds.

56:46.310 --> 56:47.590
'But then...'

56:47.630 --> 56:50.910
There's smoke. There's smoke.

56:50.950 --> 56:55.110
It's on fire.Stig! Out! Out of the car!

56:55.150 --> 56:57.830
Turn the engine off.

56:57.870 --> 57:01.510
Your stupid plywood splitter has caught fire!

57:01.550 --> 57:03.470
It's still on fire.

57:03.510 --> 57:05.910
It is the splitter.It's on fire.

57:05.950 --> 57:07.710
Wait a minute.

57:07.750 --> 57:09.670
This is something I've wanted to do.

57:09.710 --> 57:13.750
I have worked in television for 20 years and never had the chance yet, OK?

57:13.790 --> 57:15.470
Back to the studio.That's my line!

57:15.510 --> 57:17.990
That's what I wanted to say!

57:18.030 --> 57:19.910
May, youBLEEP!

57:27.990 --> 57:32.430
What I thought I'd do is put the fire out and then say...

57:32.470 --> 57:35.510
Back to the studio. Ha ha!

57:37.310 --> 57:39.430
APPLAUSE

57:42.070 --> 57:45.110
Anyway, we failed.

57:45.150 --> 57:51.470
But we decided not to give up, and in our spare time we kept working on the Avantime.

57:51.510 --> 57:56.590
Little details, to see how fast we could actually make it go.

57:56.630 --> 58:01.670
We didn't have any money left, obviously, so we spent our time fine-tuning adjustments, getting

58:01.710 --> 58:06.070
the suspension, the brakes right, the camber on the wheels exactly lined up.

58:06.110 --> 58:13.110
We even gave The Stig a plate of his favourite raw pork, for some heroics in our last do-or-die lap.

58:13.150 --> 58:15.590
And here comes that lap now.

58:17.150 --> 58:18.830
'And he's off! So, this is it.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.750
'Come on, Stig.

58:21.790 --> 58:24.710
'Look at that. It looks like a touring car!

58:24.750 --> 58:27.750
'A French plastic one, but a touring car nevertheless.

58:27.790 --> 58:31.310
'Look at that, look at the brakes, it shows they're working well.

58:31.350 --> 58:33.670
'Brilliant-looking thing.

58:33.710 --> 58:35.310
'Now, coming up to Chicago.

58:35.350 --> 58:39.150
'Here he is. More brilliant braking.

58:39.190 --> 58:43.350
'Taking that quite wide. Probably a Formula One line, that.

58:43.390 --> 58:46.390
'Going down to the hammerhead, this is the real test.

58:46.430 --> 58:49.630
'Look at it squirming under braking, very effective.

58:49.670 --> 58:53.390
'Gets the tail out nicely one way, back the other.

58:53.430 --> 58:59.230
'Understeer a bit, but the MDF aerodynamics keeping it on the tarmac beautifully.

58:59.270 --> 59:02.230
'Now, come on, this is James's engine tuning here,

59:02.270 --> 59:05.470
'coupled with my exhaust, obviously. Look at the power.

59:07.310 --> 59:11.590
'Stig would be looking impressed if you could see his face - assuming he has one.

59:11.630 --> 59:13.630
'Two corners left.

59:13.670 --> 59:15.430
'He's lost it!

59:15.470 --> 59:20.030
'No, wait, that's not out of control, it's drifting like an Evo X.

59:20.070 --> 59:23.590
'It's impressive. Here he comes through Gambon, and across the line.'

59:23.630 --> 59:27.310
APPLAUSE

59:30.150 --> 59:31.750
This is what we're waiting for.

59:34.190 --> 59:36.230
This is 1:28.2.

59:36.270 --> 59:39.550
We did it in...1...

59:39.590 --> 59:43.750
It's down here, it's a disaster. That is completely baffling, because

59:43.790 --> 59:49.350
every year in this country we spend £906 million modifying cars.

59:49.390 --> 59:53.030
As far as we can tell, it's money down the drain.All wasted!

59:53.070 --> 59:55.070
And on that bombshell, it's time to end.

59:55.110 --> 59:58.390
Thank you very much for watching. See you next week. Goodnight.
