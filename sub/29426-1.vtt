00:43.334 --> 00:49.126
A God that can be understood is no God.

01:22.251 --> 01:24.209
Tripartite Goddess.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.876
Bearer of fruits.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.167
Cast your gaze upon the earth,

01:37.501 --> 01:39.376
Tripartite Goddess,

01:41.376 --> 01:44.459
make the sun rise once more.

01:46.376 --> 01:47.667
Tripartite Goddess.

01:49.584 --> 01:52.251
Bearer of fruits.

01:54.459 --> 01:56.959
Cast your gaze upon the earth,

01:58.001 --> 02:00.876
and make the sun rise once more.

02:02.251 --> 02:03.917
Tripartite Goddess.

02:05.167 --> 02:08.459
Bearer of fruits.

02:11.167 --> 02:14.292
Cast your gaze upon the earth,

02:15.001 --> 02:18.167
and make the sun rise once more.

03:05.126 --> 03:06.334
Run!

03:09.501 --> 03:10.751
Run!

04:29.584 --> 04:31.167
Remus!

04:32.417 --> 04:33.959
Brother!

04:40.709 --> 04:42.376
Romulus!

04:43.792 --> 04:45.334
Remus!

04:47.584 --> 04:48.834
Brother!

04:49.292 --> 04:51.417
Hang on to me!

04:58.292 --> 04:59.292
Brother!

05:20.709 --> 05:21.834
Romulus!

05:54.709 --> 05:55.834
Brother!

09:30.584 --> 09:32.709
They have taken our animals.

09:34.584 --> 09:37.209
We have no land.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.501
We are alone.

09:47.626 --> 09:49.751
The Gods do not look out for us.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.167
Eat.

10:03.792 --> 10:05.751
What is the point in eating?

10:06.876 --> 10:09.459
We are in Alba.

10:10.626 --> 10:13.251
You know what will happen tomorrow.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.501
Eat:

10:20.292 --> 10:22.667
because it has not happened yet.

13:03.501 --> 13:05.626
It is the God.

13:59.126 --> 14:01.251
Tripartite Goddess.

14:01.876 --> 14:05.167
Oh mother, oh bearer of fruit...

14:07.084 --> 14:10.834
May your sacred fire
continue to burn for us.

14:11.459 --> 14:15.834
Bring the waters of the river
to your womb

14:16.917 --> 14:19.501
and leave us the life
that you gave us.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.501
Oh, fire

14:22.834 --> 14:24.501
that destroys our enemies

14:25.667 --> 14:29.709
protect me and my people.

14:31.501 --> 14:34.292
Look at my affliction

14:35.167 --> 14:37.251
and say enough.

14:39.459 --> 14:41.792
And say enough.

18:15.876 --> 18:17.667
Take me.

18:21.209 --> 18:23.459
Take me.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.709
Hit me.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.126
Trust me, hit me.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.917
Harder!

19:57.751 --> 19:59.126
Again!

20:09.792 --> 20:11.042
Mum...

20:16.084 --> 20:18.001
Protect your brother...

20:18.709 --> 20:20.834
always protect him.

20:23.542 --> 20:26.209
May God bless your name.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.834
Mother, stay with us.

20:30.959 --> 20:33.667
Quick, run quickly.

23:59.501 --> 24:02.501
This time the God is coming with us.

24:29.626 --> 24:33.501
Brother, bring the God with us.

24:33.876 --> 24:37.501
We will no longer be alone.

26:29.292 --> 26:33.792
Alba will send
the iron knights after us.

26:35.584 --> 26:36.959
We cannot stay here.

26:38.501 --> 26:41.751
After the double inlet, on the peak,

26:42.501 --> 26:43.917
the land is high.

26:44.709 --> 26:49.292
Maybe we can cross the river there.

26:50.334 --> 26:53.501
But there is no way to get there.

26:54.584 --> 26:56.834
There is the forest.

27:00.001 --> 27:03.667
No one gets out of the forest alive.

27:06.251 --> 27:08.501
It is the land of the Velienses.

27:09.709 --> 27:11.209
The forest is cursed.

27:12.084 --> 27:13.876
It is infested with spirits.

27:14.542 --> 27:16.459
They hide among the trees.

27:21.501 --> 27:23.501
We have no choice.

28:13.501 --> 28:15.001
Do not do it!

28:17.792 --> 28:19.667
If you want to live...

28:42.167 --> 28:43.667
Brother...

28:52.042 --> 28:55.209
Come on get up, my brother,
get up, please.

28:56.459 --> 28:58.292
You cannot take him with you.

28:59.501 --> 29:02.501
Leave him here,
so he can die in peace.

29:05.001 --> 29:06.709
My brother is alive.

29:06.876 --> 29:11.167
We will not risk our lives
to save a dead man.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.042
We are safe thanks to them.

29:15.251 --> 29:17.876
As long as he can make <i>it...</i>

29:18.209 --> 29:20.459
they will come with us.

29:49.001 --> 29:53.459
It was not a good idea
taking the woman.

29:56.501 --> 29:58.501
I promised my brother

29:59.334 --> 30:01.792
I would bring the fire with us.

30:05.751 --> 30:07.709
Walk ahead.

30:12.876 --> 30:15.042
Tie him to me.

30:40.459 --> 30:42.834
We cannot stop.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.626
Get up, all of you.

30:45.834 --> 30:50.042
We will rest for the night
and Ieave at dawn.

30:50.251 --> 30:52.626
Do you not understand
we are dead meat this way?

30:53.167 --> 30:55.501
The sooner we get out of here,
the sooner we will be safe.

30:57.876 --> 31:00.292
You should not be alone
in the forest.

31:01.084 --> 31:04.167
It will be easier to defend ourselves
if we all stick together.

31:04.542 --> 31:06.334
How can we defend ourselves?

31:09.292 --> 31:10.876
Alba will not follow us in here.

31:11.167 --> 31:12.959
This is the land of the Velienses.

31:13.334 --> 31:15.876
If we stay here
the spirits will catch us.

31:16.209 --> 31:18.501
Or the Wolf Heads
will slit our throats.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.209
Marce, sit down!

31:20.792 --> 31:22.584
The spirits will Ieave you in peace

31:22.959 --> 31:25.251
if you do not attract them
by making noise.

31:27.501 --> 31:29.167
It is the same with the Velienses.

31:30.959 --> 31:32.334
Is anyone coming with me?

31:32.667 --> 31:34.751
Is anyone coming with me?

31:44.126 --> 31:45.459
You?

31:46.459 --> 31:47.751
Not even you?

31:49.334 --> 31:51.501
We cannot go on alone.

31:53.251 --> 31:55.167
So drop dead, then.

31:55.584 --> 31:58.626
You all drop dead, damn you.

32:29.876 --> 32:31.251
I am hungry.

32:32.542 --> 32:35.376
Come on.
We cannot stop.

33:27.001 --> 33:29.459
There is no hope.

33:30.792 --> 33:32.917
He asked for it.

33:34.626 --> 33:38.042
That man has touched the Vestal.
He is cursed now.

33:39.709 --> 33:42.876
We cannot bring him with us.

34:57.334 --> 34:58.792
Brother?

36:16.876 --> 36:18.042
Do not touch him!

36:19.626 --> 36:22.334
He carries the curse of the God!

36:23.084 --> 36:26.042
We must sacrifice him
if we want to survive.

36:26.792 --> 36:28.917
This is the will of the Gods.

36:31.292 --> 36:33.876
Let me kill him

36:34.251 --> 36:36.584
and you will be safe along with us.

36:36.751 --> 36:40.584
Nobody wants to hurt you.

36:42.917 --> 36:44.584
Come any closer

36:45.459 --> 36:46.792
and you are dead.

36:49.501 --> 36:51.292
Listen to me!

36:52.292 --> 36:54.876
That man has violated the fire.

36:55.584 --> 36:59.292
The God will kill us one by one
as long as he is alive.

37:01.292 --> 37:03.667
We will all die.

37:09.292 --> 37:10.709
Kill him!

37:15.959 --> 37:17.292
Kill him!

37:29.292 --> 37:31.042
You take one more step

37:32.126 --> 37:35.292
and I swear that today you will be
in the kingdom of the dead.

37:36.292 --> 37:39.834
You Will die with him!

38:40.042 --> 38:42.584
Remember my eyes.

39:26.751 --> 39:28.584
Who else wants to die?

39:32.251 --> 39:34.001
Who else wants to die?

39:43.251 --> 39:44.542
You

39:47.459 --> 39:49.001
serva nt

39:55.542 --> 39:57.292
do you want to die?

40:33.542 --> 40:35.709
Look at his face.

40:39.667 --> 40:41.334
He is me.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.542
I am him.

41:26.376 --> 41:28.542
I am dving-

41:31.084 --> 41:32.667
Am I not?

41:37.001 --> 41:39.126
It was the fire...

41:45.292 --> 41:47.542
Everything will be all right.

41:49.709 --> 41:51.709
I am hungry, Remus.

41:54.959 --> 41:57.334
I am hungry and thirsty.

42:12.542 --> 42:14.251
I will be back soon.

42:53.959 --> 42:55.709
My brother is hungry.

43:00.292 --> 43:03.376
Do you also think he is cursed?

43:04.459 --> 43:07.626
No one knows the will of the Gods.

43:09.501 --> 43:10.959
Protect him

43:12.876 --> 43:15.376
Iike I will protect you.

43:16.876 --> 43:19.292
You can keep them at bay

43:20.292 --> 43:21.959
while I am not here.

43:23.376 --> 43:25.084
Before dawn

43:25.292 --> 43:26.959
if the Gods wish

43:28.292 --> 43:29.959
I will be back.

43:30.792 --> 43:33.834
You cannot hunt in the forest alone.

44:31.459 --> 44:32.959
Stop!

44:58.001 --> 44:59.584
He will not return.

45:00.876 --> 45:02.792
Tefarie was right.

45:04.042 --> 45:05.959
Let us leave the vestal here.

45:06.084 --> 45:08.667
We can flee the curse.

45:09.001 --> 45:10.876
Let us <i>do...</i>

45:12.042 --> 45:13.417
what has to be done.

45:15.751 --> 45:18.084
What if his brother comes back?

45:18.459 --> 45:19.876
He will smash our skulls.

45:21.251 --> 45:22.792
Dawn is approaching.

45:24.292 --> 45:27.626
We must sacrifice
the man to the God and leave.

45:28.459 --> 45:30.709
Let us try to save ourselves.

45:57.667 --> 45:59.292
What are you doing?

46:00.709 --> 46:02.584
We should not kill each other.

46:02.709 --> 46:06.751
Once we reach the river together,
everyone will be free.

46:07.042 --> 46:08.459
Listen to me!

46:08.667 --> 46:13.001
That man has violated the fire.

46:14.542 --> 46:17.042
The God will not let us live

46:17.251 --> 46:21.001
as long as he is among us.

46:21.501 --> 46:24.709
It is dangerous to go near the fire.

46:25.917 --> 46:27.667
That is true.

46:28.042 --> 46:31.501
But which of you
is going to carry the man?

46:32.292 --> 46:35.542
Who will stain themselves
with his sacrilegious blood?

46:36.959 --> 46:39.167
And you, old man,

46:39.292 --> 46:44.001
do you want to go against the Gods
and condemn us all to death?

46:44.126 --> 46:48.626
Do you want to carry him on your back
now that his brother's gone?

46:55.792 --> 46:56.542
Go ahead.

47:34.834 --> 47:36.334
Come on.

47:36.584 --> 47:38.376
Step into the circle.

47:39.292 --> 47:41.292
WhY

47:41.792 --> 47:43.751
have you lit the fire?

47:45.084 --> 47:47.292
The man is cursed by the Gods.

47:48.334 --> 47:49.376
Move away.

47:50.251 --> 47:51.292
Move away.

47:52.251 --> 47:53.292
Move away from him.

47:54.751 --> 47:58.459
No one can cross the circle
of the sacred fire.

47:59.751 --> 48:03.626
Holy is the earth it surrounds.

48:04.751 --> 48:06.001
Move.

48:06.459 --> 48:08.584
Move and you will be safe.

48:11.501 --> 48:12.459
Come.

48:13.834 --> 48:16.001
Cross the fire.

48:16.376 --> 48:20.709
If you really believe
this is your destiny.

48:28.334 --> 48:31.667
May the earth cover your tomb
with thorns, o Cai,

48:31.917 --> 48:35.251
and may your shadow thirst for ever.

48:35.501 --> 48:37.542
And may the Manes

48:38.251 --> 48:41.042
not sit beside your ashes

48:41.792 --> 48:46.709
and the avenger terrify your filthy
bones with his hungry dog's cry.

48:46.876 --> 48:51.917
May your grave be
an old amphora with a broken neck

48:52.042 --> 48:56.001
and may everyone pelt that grave
with sharpened stones

48:56.751 --> 48:59.376
if you blasphemously challenge
the fire of the God

48:59.834 --> 49:06.417
and may you always be cursed.

50:04.959 --> 50:06.667
He has come back!

50:22.084 --> 50:23.709
It is incredible.

51:36.292 --> 51:38.251
Eat, all of you.

52:19.334 --> 52:23.376
This is the heart
of the biggest deer of the swamp.

52:30.459 --> 52:32.751
It knelt

52:35.334 --> 52:37.876
in front of me before dying.

52:46.459 --> 52:49.542
With its heart
you will run through the mud,

52:51.667 --> 52:54.126
you will climb the tallest rocks,

52:57.667 --> 53:01.001
and stride across the Tiber
by my side,

53:02.501 --> 53:04.834
and there we will build a shelter.

53:06.626 --> 53:10.834
And we will not be afraid to sleep
at night any more.

53:12.876 --> 53:14.792
My brother.

53:35.667 --> 53:37.501
What are you doing?

53:37.876 --> 53:40.376
Healing the wound.

53:45.667 --> 53:47.876
She does not want to hurt him.

54:53.209 --> 54:55.042
The earth is soft.

55:04.667 --> 55:06.917
The fog is rising.

55:08.792 --> 55:11.417
It will rain today.

55:23.042 --> 55:25.042
Be ready to leave.

55:27.626 --> 55:30.251
The Gods are looking kindly on us.

55:35.042 --> 55:36.834
Look at me.

55:39.167 --> 55:40.917
The fire protected my brother.

55:44.501 --> 55:46.292
My brother is alive.

55:49.084 --> 55:53.292
I have survived
the fury of the Tiber.

55:55.334 --> 55:58.917
I have saved you
from the death of Alba.

56:00.042 --> 56:01.376
I

56:02.417 --> 56:05.626
fed you.

56:08.751 --> 56:11.417
You are not cursed.

56:12.709 --> 56:14.917
You are not alone.

56:19.251 --> 56:21.667
We will pass through
the heart of the swamp

56:22.667 --> 56:26.126
and when the Velienses attack,
you must stay together.

56:32.042 --> 56:34.667
Behold your king.

56:41.876 --> 56:43.834
You are no longer beasts.

56:44.167 --> 56:46.626
You are united, you are a group

56:47.917 --> 56:50.876
that will soon have its own land.

56:53.501 --> 56:56.334
If anyone wants to leave,
they should do so now.

56:58.667 --> 57:01.417
<i>H anyone wants to chaﬂenge me agaìn</i>

57:03.126 --> 57:05.084
do it now!

57:09.126 --> 57:11.667
Those who stay and accept this

57:11.959 --> 57:14.292
will be my eyes when I am away,

57:14.667 --> 57:16.709
my ears while I sleep,

57:16.959 --> 57:20.626
my heart
if I am attacked in battle.

57:22.709 --> 57:25.001
We will be fear.

57:25.251 --> 57:28.459
We will be the terror
that keeps people awake at night.

57:29.501 --> 57:31.834
We will survive

57:32.251 --> 57:33.376
today

57:33.626 --> 57:34.667
tomorrow

57:35.709 --> 57:39.126
until the day
we sit down with the Gods.

57:40.709 --> 57:44.667
Until the day
we sit clown with the Gods.

58:46.334 --> 58:47.959
Come, fight!

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:35.209
Do not hurt him!

01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:04.501
You no longer have protection.

01:03:06.376 --> 01:03:09.251
Your warriors are all dead.

01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:13.417
What do you want?

01:03:19.626 --> 01:03:21.501
Show me the shelter
that is mine by right.

01:03:28.667 --> 01:03:32.709
I am the head of this village now.

01:03:55.334 --> 01:03:57.042
Sort my brother out

01:04:00.251 --> 01:04:02.126
and let him rest.

01:05:09.959 --> 01:05:13.001
There was something non-human
in your strength.

01:05:27.001 --> 01:05:28.917
What did you see?

01:05:31.834 --> 01:05:38.126
I saw something
Iike a Iight around you.

01:05:41.251 --> 01:05:43.959
You are full of signs.

01:06:25.751 --> 01:06:27.501
And now

01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:31.667
what do you see?

01:06:34.834 --> 01:06:38.084
More than a man...

01:06:47.751 --> 01:06:50.292
Only the God can have me.

01:06:56.792 --> 01:06:58.501
Are you the God?

01:08:03.417 --> 01:08:04.667
What is happening?

01:08:05.376 --> 01:08:08.001
It is the dance
for the death of the warriors.

01:08:21.876 --> 01:08:23.626
Stop.

01:08:27.376 --> 01:08:29.042
Give it to the king.

01:09:10.834 --> 01:09:13.167
You know the art of the haruspex?

01:09:47.042 --> 01:09:53.001
Identical is the order that rules
the heavens and the living beings.

01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:57.459
The fate of the heavens is written
in the innards of the living.

01:10:16.167 --> 01:10:21.792
Two united as one

01:10:23.917 --> 01:10:26.376
Iike a Ieaf and its spine.

01:10:27.042 --> 01:10:28.792
Brothers.

01:10:34.084 --> 01:10:36.667
Among you

01:10:36.834 --> 01:10:39.417
stands a king.

01:10:39.626 --> 01:10:41.917
He will found a new empire

01:10:42.626 --> 01:10:44.751
Iike the world has never known

01:10:44.959 --> 01:10:47.667
and never will know again
in the years to come.

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:58.042
The king will be remembered in time,

01:10:58.334 --> 01:11:00.834
even after his death, as a God.

01:11:02.292 --> 01:11:03.709
Hordes of men

01:11:04.251 --> 01:11:06.417
will obey his commands,

01:11:07.417 --> 01:11:10.251
coming together
and protecting each other

01:11:11.459 --> 01:11:16.626
after having been slaves for so long.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:20.751
However...

01:11:21.917 --> 01:11:24.292
That is the quadrant
of the underworld...

01:11:31.126 --> 01:11:32.084
Go on.

01:11:32.876 --> 01:11:34.292
Finish it!

01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:38.751
I am not afraid
of the will of the Gods.

01:11:53.084 --> 01:11:55.042
Of the two, only one will remain.

01:11:56.667 --> 01:11:58.626
The leaf will come away
from its spine.

01:12:01.667 --> 01:12:05.251
Iight will shine on one,

01:12:06.667 --> 01:12:09.126
the other will slip away
into eternal darkness.

01:12:11.334 --> 01:12:15.167
My brother is healing.

01:12:15.292 --> 01:12:18.042
Of the two, only one will be Ieft.

01:12:19.876 --> 01:12:22.334
A brother will kill his brother.

01:12:22.834 --> 01:12:26.126
Only out of that blood
will a king be born.

01:12:29.376 --> 01:12:31.001
That brotherly blood...

01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:37.876
It will be his strength,

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:41.667
and his blessing.

01:12:43.084 --> 01:12:44.709
This is the Gods' will.

01:13:11.834 --> 01:13:13.917
Obey the will of the Gods, my king.

01:13:45.626 --> 01:13:46.501
Come.

01:13:48.042 --> 01:13:49.667
Do not be afraid.

01:14:12.167 --> 01:14:13.626
Did you hear?

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:34.626
You have kept me with you

01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:37.959
way beyond death itself.

01:14:42.126 --> 01:14:43.917
You will be a great king.

01:14:48.292 --> 01:14:49.709
Do not be afraid, brother.

01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:57.751
I will be next to you.

01:15:32.001 --> 01:15:34.417
What if that woman lied?

01:15:39.876 --> 01:15:42.834
No one can oppose

01:15:43.917 --> 01:15:46.834
the will of the Gods.

01:15:53.667 --> 01:15:55.167
Kill me.

01:15:57.459 --> 01:15:59.126
Kill me, brother.

01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:04.834
She lied.

01:16:05.751 --> 01:16:09.001
She is punishing us
because we kidnapped her.

01:16:10.209 --> 01:16:12.501
The God speaks through her.

01:16:13.209 --> 01:16:16.626
You cannot challenge his will.

01:16:20.126 --> 01:16:22.626
Then God has abandoned us.

01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:32.959
King... king... king!
King... king... king!

01:16:33.251 --> 01:16:35.084
My brother is alive!

01:16:39.417 --> 01:16:40.876
Stop, Remus!

01:16:41.042 --> 01:16:42.626
Do you not understand?

01:16:44.251 --> 01:16:46.751
Her God wants to see us all dead.

01:16:47.667 --> 01:16:49.876
Leave her alone,
do not touch the God!

01:17:09.001 --> 01:17:11.376
What do you know about God, old man?

01:17:30.251 --> 01:17:31.959
I beg you, God, save us.

01:17:32.251 --> 01:17:33.376
Silence!

01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:36.626
I do not decide what I see
in the future.

01:17:37.667 --> 01:17:40.334
My voice
is only the breath of the Gods.

01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:42.459
You want to confuse me!

01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:50.751
Obey the Gods

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.209
and you will live in glory.

01:17:55.292 --> 01:17:57.084
Fight them

01:17:58.626 --> 01:18:00.501
and you will be destroyed.

01:18:13.459 --> 01:18:16.001
If obeying the will of the Gods

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:19.084
means killing my brother,

01:18:22.126 --> 01:18:25.042
then I am the only God I recognise.

01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:34.834
Please do not Ieave me to such
a terrible death, kill me instead.

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:37.334
Remus!

01:18:50.334 --> 01:18:52.292
If your God loves you

01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:56.042
he will save you
from the hunger of the beasts.

01:19:05.292 --> 01:19:07.459
I am my own destiny.

01:19:09.251 --> 01:19:10.459
And you

01:19:12.667 --> 01:19:15.834
are the sign of my victory
against the Gods.

01:19:30.417 --> 01:19:32.709
Do not curse me, witch!

01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:39.501
I am not cursing you, Remus,

01:19:41.417 --> 01:19:44.667
I am praying for you
to save yourself.

01:19:59.417 --> 01:20:00.667
Go awayg

01:20:01.376 --> 01:20:03.001
Go awayg

01:20:03.376 --> 01:20:05.667
No one will touch that body!

01:20:09.042 --> 01:20:12.001
This is what happens
to those who disobey.

01:20:25.792 --> 01:20:27.459
You are healed.

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:30.417
Your king has healed him!

01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:43.084
What I did was not done in vain.

01:20:46.667 --> 01:20:48.292
Where is she?

01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:56.126
She was a witch.

01:20:57.917 --> 01:21:00.459
What happened to the sacred fire,
then?

01:21:03.209 --> 01:21:05.417
I chose your life.

01:21:16.334 --> 01:21:18.792
The fire was our only hope.

01:21:22.209 --> 01:21:24.417
Now we are Ieft with nothing.

01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:32.709
At least let the women bury him
according to their rites.

01:21:38.334 --> 01:21:39.709
Stop.

01:21:42.167 --> 01:21:43.626
Stop!

01:21:44.126 --> 01:21:46.167
No one will touch that body.

01:21:49.667 --> 01:21:51.667
You will do what I do.

01:21:55.167 --> 01:21:56.917
Come to your senses.

01:21:58.209 --> 01:22:00.667
You must not disobey me!

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:04.667
Do you understand?

01:22:06.001 --> 01:22:08.376
You must not disobey me!

01:22:10.001 --> 01:22:13.459
The days are over
when we obeyed the will of the Gods.

01:22:15.126 --> 01:22:16.334
Enough!

01:22:17.917 --> 01:22:19.126
Remus.

01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:43.667
Do not dare!

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:47.334
Bow your head before your king!

01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:14.709
All of you bow your heads!

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:19.459
Do as he says.

01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:52.626
Are you looking for the fire,
brother?

01:24:08.667 --> 01:24:10.626
Here is the fire!

01:24:29.126 --> 01:24:31.501
Here is your God.

01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:05.042
Stop, Remus.

01:25:06.209 --> 01:25:08.209
Did God stop

01:25:09.167 --> 01:25:12.376
when we were dragged away
as prisoners Iike animals?

01:25:12.959 --> 01:25:16.417
Or when they made us fight
each other?

01:25:17.876 --> 01:25:20.667
Power is built on fear, brother.

01:25:24.751 --> 01:25:27.459
Men fear the Gods

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:33.292
which is why the Gods control them.

01:25:37.334 --> 01:25:38.751
What about you?

01:25:40.209 --> 01:25:41.834
Do you not fear the Gods?

01:25:51.292 --> 01:25:53.042
Look around you.

01:25:55.209 --> 01:25:57.126
We are alone.

01:26:00.084 --> 01:26:03.251
Who do you think these slaves fear?

01:26:04.417 --> 01:26:07.126
What is the name
that makes them tremble?

01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:11.001
Who makes them obey?

01:26:17.167 --> 01:26:19.167
Remus is that name.

01:26:23.876 --> 01:26:26.667
I will be the fire.

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:31.167
And there will be no God

01:26:31.667 --> 01:26:34.334
for us to fear.

01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:16.501
We are together,

01:27:19.292 --> 01:27:21.626
nothing matters more than this.

01:27:38.042 --> 01:27:42.251
You really cannot hear the God?

01:28:42.876 --> 01:28:44.209
Who is it?

01:29:14.626 --> 01:29:16.001
Who is it?

01:29:32.251 --> 01:29:33.876
Who is it?

01:30:41.126 --> 01:30:42.917
What did I do?

01:30:44.292 --> 01:30:45.417
Run.

01:30:47.917 --> 01:30:51.667
I see the Gods' plan for us
coming to an end.

01:30:55.501 --> 01:30:58.501
We were all part of it

01:30:59.917 --> 01:31:02.167
without wanting to be.

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:05.917
Me as well.

01:31:12.001 --> 01:31:14.876
We saved

01:31:16.084 --> 01:31:19.042
the assassin.

01:31:23.626 --> 01:31:25.042
What does that mean?

01:31:28.917 --> 01:31:30.126
<i>Run...</i>

01:33:13.959 --> 01:33:17.167
Look at the horror
your brother Ieft behind.

01:33:20.042 --> 01:33:22.709
- Where is he?
- He Ieft in the morning.

01:33:47.917 --> 01:33:49.251
It has gone out.

01:33:54.001 --> 01:33:57.959
I watched it for a Iong time
but I see no fire.

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:18.917
We will all bury the body together.

01:35:41.251 --> 01:35:44.001
Without warriors
we are no longer protected.

01:35:45.417 --> 01:35:49.417
We must leave the village
and we must have a chief.

01:35:55.334 --> 01:35:57.542
The fire has chosen you.

01:36:24.459 --> 01:36:26.751
For thirty years

01:36:27.876 --> 01:36:29.584
you will feed the fire

01:36:30.584 --> 01:36:32.917
constantly

01:36:39.959 --> 01:36:42.167
and should it

01:36:43.334 --> 01:36:45.126
ever go out

01:36:47.042 --> 01:36:49.542
your life will end at the same time.

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:56.542
The God

01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:59.542
has chosen you

01:37:00.376 --> 01:37:04.167
for this great honour.

01:37:44.126 --> 01:37:46.459
The river is near.

01:37:47.376 --> 01:37:48.751
Move!

01:38:02.126 --> 01:38:03.917
The horsemen of Alba.

01:38:06.542 --> 01:38:08.626
They will get to my brother.

01:38:11.667 --> 01:38:13.292
Do not go.

01:38:14.376 --> 01:38:17.917
No one knows
what God has in store for him.

01:38:19.542 --> 01:38:20.542
Leave him to his fate.

01:38:21.667 --> 01:38:23.542
<i>He has chauenged the Gods tuo much.</i>

01:38:23.667 --> 01:38:25.376
What he did

01:38:26.292 --> 01:38:27.959
was my fault.

01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:31.709
Your brother has killed our fathers,

01:38:32.126 --> 01:38:34.917
he has stained our land
with sacrilege.

01:38:36.126 --> 01:38:38.542
No one can defeat Alba.

01:38:39.667 --> 01:38:41.376
They are the strongest.

01:38:42.959 --> 01:38:45.959
That must be no more.

01:38:47.917 --> 01:38:50.584
As long as Alba is strong

01:38:51.251 --> 01:38:52.626
and feared

01:38:55.917 --> 01:38:58.001
no one will ever be free.

01:38:59.751 --> 01:39:01.709
NO one.

01:39:03.584 --> 01:39:05.584
This is our enemy.

01:39:07.084 --> 01:39:08.751
As children,

01:39:10.542 --> 01:39:12.584
we shared the same fate as you.

01:39:58.167 --> 01:40:00.334
What is it, sir?

01:40:04.251 --> 01:40:05.709
Did you not hear?

01:40:08.251 --> 01:40:09.751
No, sir.

01:40:12.626 --> 01:40:14.626
I hear nothing.

01:40:33.417 --> 01:40:35.709
The vultures are approaching.

01:40:40.876 --> 01:40:42.292
Soon

01:40:43.209 --> 01:40:45.001
we will be on the other side.

01:41:11.917 --> 01:41:13.209
Alba's men!

01:41:13.876 --> 01:41:15.376
Into the water!

01:41:17.751 --> 01:41:20.334
Come into the water!

01:46:42.167 --> 01:46:43.667
Stop!

01:46:48.667 --> 01:46:50.501
You stop, brother.

01:46:56.459 --> 01:46:58.084
He is one of my men.

01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:09.917
And those are my slaves.

01:47:12.334 --> 01:47:14.626
They are free men now,

01:47:16.876 --> 01:47:18.709
they are our allies.

01:47:19.709 --> 01:47:21.709
You owe your life to them.

01:47:24.501 --> 01:47:26.459
And you owe yours to me.

01:47:29.334 --> 01:47:31.667
I won them in battle.

01:47:33.126 --> 01:47:37.667
Who gave you the right
to reach an agreement with them?

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:39.209
Leave me alone!

01:47:39.417 --> 01:47:41.084
Lower your weapons

01:47:41.459 --> 01:47:42.584
and let her go.

01:47:47.709 --> 01:47:49.542
This is a sacred ground.

01:47:51.292 --> 01:47:53.709
Says who?

01:47:57.959 --> 01:47:59.917
I do, Cai.

01:48:00.167 --> 01:48:02.126
I who brought the fire.

01:48:07.501 --> 01:48:08.751
Back.

01:48:11.584 --> 01:48:13.167
Stay back.

01:48:36.626 --> 01:48:38.001
Let us go.

01:49:58.042 --> 01:50:01.084
That fire is our downfall, brother.

01:50:04.459 --> 01:50:08.084
The power is within us.

01:50:10.251 --> 01:50:12.417
Inside here...

01:50:18.917 --> 01:50:22.334
there is no God.

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:27.042
Do you understand?

01:50:33.917 --> 01:50:37.584
Do not dare cross this line.

01:50:42.167 --> 01:50:43.917
Or?

01:50:45.626 --> 01:50:47.209
What will you do?

01:50:55.501 --> 01:50:57.667
You want to become king?

01:50:59.917 --> 01:51:01.334
Come on!

01:51:11.501 --> 01:51:12.667
Get out!

01:51:33.292 --> 01:51:35.459
Look at your king!

01:51:38.459 --> 01:51:40.001
A coward.

01:54:03.542 --> 01:54:04.917
Brother...

01:54:05.917 --> 01:54:07.709
Remus.

01:54:18.917 --> 01:54:20.959
Take me with you.

01:54:30.959 --> 01:54:32.667
You will live.

01:54:40.584 --> 01:54:42.417
I will take you with <i>me...</i>

01:54:52.417 --> 01:54:55.292
and we will be together.

01:54:58.001 --> 01:55:00.876
You will build a secure city...

01:55:03.292 --> 01:55:05.751
beyond the river

01:55:10.209 --> 01:55:12.667
and bury me there.

01:55:21.126 --> 01:55:23.001
My king...

01:55:33.001 --> 01:55:35.376
I cannot see anything.

01:55:38.667 --> 01:55:40.042
I am here.

01:57:18.876 --> 01:57:21.251
Here is our land, brother.

01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:42.501
The destiny set out by the Gods

01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:46.709
is now fulfilled.

01:57:49.626 --> 01:57:53.667
We will unite with those
who no longer have anything,

01:57:55.667 --> 01:58:01.001
and all the peoples along the Tiber
will be part of this alliance.

01:58:05.667 --> 01:58:07.459
But this city

01:58:08.917 --> 01:58:13.292
is born from my pain...

01:58:16.417 --> 01:58:19.167
and from the blood of my brother.

01:58:24.584 --> 01:58:27.917
At night his soul
will knock on your doors,

01:58:28.042 --> 01:58:31.542
to remind you
of the price of the future.

01:58:34.959 --> 01:58:36.542
And you, Gods,

01:58:37.584 --> 01:58:40.084
dull my eyes

01:58:40.501 --> 01:58:43.334
so they will not see

01:58:44.459 --> 01:58:46.751
<i>what my sword has dune.</i>

01:58:51.167 --> 01:58:54.417
I wish I died instead.

01:59:04.417 --> 01:59:08.001
May this fraternal blood
that soaks our land

01:59:09.584 --> 01:59:11.501
become as hard as stone,

01:59:11.626 --> 01:59:15.334
and may one word be engraved on it,
and echo in the head of everyone

01:59:15.459 --> 01:59:20.542
who dares cross it,
attack it or ask for refuge.

01:59:37.251 --> 01:59:38.917
"Tremble...

01:59:39.917 --> 01:59:42.126
this is Rome".

02:00:41.084 --> 02:00:44.876
After the Foundation, Romulus gathered the errants,
the poor and the assassins cast away from other cities.

02:00:45.001 --> 02:00:48.501
He gave them courage and strength, and told them
they would no longer have to show mercy to anyone.

02:05:31.376 --> 02:05:34.084
