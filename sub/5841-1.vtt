07:09.663 --> 07:16.701
I'll tell you. Did you know that this
property is almost 100 years old?

07:16.703 --> 07:17.302
100?

07:17.304 --> 07:25.076
There use to be a family that lived here.
And their house mysteriously burned down.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.245
Really?

07:27.247 --> 07:27.979
Video tape this.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.209
Are you ok?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.110
You want to sit down?

07:59.112 --> 08:02.046
Looks like someone had
too much to drink.

08:02.048 --> 08:05.283
Let me get you some water.
Hold on.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.318
Too much to drink huh.

08:07.386 --> 08:10.989
It's the alcohol. Guess the old
ladies can't handle it.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.992
But you know how to
hold your liquor.

08:14.059 --> 08:18.229
You look like you're holding
your liquor really well.

08:18.664 --> 08:23.468
I don't believe in- Do you?
I don't believe in Bigfoot.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.574

08:54.034 --> 08:57.502

at you right in the eye.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.206
Maybe this is my
birthday present.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.808
15 minutes tops.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.644
Awkward eye contact.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.587
She's like on
something right now.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.123
This party went south fast.

So you probably don't recognize this room
because we finally made it to Adams, Tennessee.

10:06.639 --> 10:07.371
Barf.

10:07.373 --> 10:12.176
So the clothes I picked up that you'll see
in this episode are from different places on

10:12.178 --> 10:17.615
the way here. So the 1st dress
I got at the O'Hara airport.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.517
My last piece of home.

10:19.919 --> 10:30.595

14:18.591 --> 14:22.360
Peace out and thank you for joining

14:33.872 --> 14:34.605
Are you rolling?

14:34.607 --> 14:35.639
Yeah I'm rolling. I'm rolling.

14:35.641 --> 14:37.908
Alright, here we are in the woods in
Tennessee. We're gonna scope it out.

14:37.910 --> 14:41.612
Check out these holes here. The
ground, it's pretty intense.

14:41.614 --> 14:48.452
This. Be careful, zoom in. This
is all poison oak right here.

14:48.454 --> 14:49.120
Told you it was awesome.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.089
Are there hillbillies that live
in the woods still?

14:52.091 --> 14:55.826
There is an old hermit that
lives around here.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.594
There's a hermit?

14:56.596 --> 14:57.928
- Yeah.
- Is he gonna make me squeal like a pig?

14:57.930 --> 14:59.663
Got a pretty mouth boy.

14:59.665 --> 15:03.934
This is uh- River bed.
During the wet season.

15:03.936 --> 15:07.671
- This is all filled with-
- Water

15:07.673 --> 15:08.806
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.742
- Hey Look at that.
- What's that?

15:11.843 --> 15:13.511
That looks like blood.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.479
Does it taste like blood?

15:15.481 --> 15:17.415
You taste it.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.816
Where does it go?

15:19.451 --> 15:22.520
Looks like it dropped
out of the tree.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.189
Or something died here.
There's drops going this way.

15:25.191 --> 15:29.627
Did it fall out of the tree?
It's weird, there's like a trail.

15:29.694 --> 15:32.630
Holy Shit!
What the fuck is that?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.432
Oh my god!

15:34.434 --> 15:34.965
Eww! What is it?

15:34.967 --> 15:39.570
The skin is ripped off the face. It's
just the jaw. Like the skull is there.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.173
I've never seen anything
like that before.

15:42.974 --> 15:45.743
Say Cheese

15:49.581 --> 15:55.619
Whoo!

16:12.138 --> 16:19.577

16:20.112 --> 16:22.646

16:22.648 --> 16:26.750
- I swear to god. Let me show you.
- There's nothing there.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.853
Yes there was!

16:28.855 --> 16:30.688
Yes there was!

16:30.755 --> 16:35.125
It's on the recording.
I'll show you right now.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.641
It's 3am.

16:50.775 --> 16:54.078
And there is scratching
at the door.

16:54.246 --> 16:56.947
I think Dana is
trying to scare me.

16:58.049 --> 17:00.084
I'm gonna go check it out.

17:07.291 --> 17:12.061
I see you Dana. Ha ha ha.

17:20.972 --> 17:22.973
I'm gonna get her.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.315
Maybe not.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.093
Is she down stairs?

17:46.298 --> 17:49.199
I'll check the bathroom out.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.204
Where the hell did she go?

17:54.206 --> 17:59.677
Defiantly not going in there.

18:09.721 --> 18:14.224
It's way to late for this shit.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.065
I'll fucking kill her.

18:25.303 --> 18:27.338
Is she in the kitchen?

18:31.643 --> 18:34.278
Where the fuck are you at Dana?

18:37.149 --> 18:39.283
What the fuck? Shit!

18:48.159 --> 18:51.629
I'm hearing some spooky sounds
downstairs in the basement.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.299
So I'm sending you down there to
go check it out.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.227

19:28.033 --> 19:29.033

19:40.979 --> 19:42.413
Whoa! Shit!

19:53.291 --> 19:55.159
What the fuck?

20:02.434 --> 20:05.169
Well you don't go out and
dance with the girlfriends.

20:05.171 --> 20:09.206
You know when you're dancing with your
girlfriend, some guy comes up that you don't

20:09.208 --> 20:11.275
think he's attractive, your
like "Oh we're lesbians".

20:11.277 --> 20:14.817
Yeah Yeah Yeah. And you kind
of grab your girlfriend.

20:14.843 --> 20:16.914
You've done that?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.118
I never made out
with my girlfriend.

20:21.120 --> 20:26.056
Hi. Your dad and I are gonna go to bed now.
So can you keep it down a little bit.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.822
Ok. Ok. Sorry.
Sorry Mama Sawyer.

20:29.848 --> 20:31.353
Goodnight.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.309

20:37.335 --> 20:39.136
Are these cute?

20:39.138 --> 20:41.004
I love the ruffles.

20:41.006 --> 20:44.508
You know, I just want to bring
all the boys to the yard.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.945
Yeah you are bringing
the boys to the yard.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.081
It makes your boobs
look really big.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.083
Thanks. Are you saying
they are not usually big?

20:53.085 --> 20:56.053
Nah they're always big.

20:56.888 --> 20:58.922
What are you reading?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.457
Ok. This question.

21:00.459 --> 21:01.058
Ok.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.359
They're like the Dear
Abby stuff but sexually.

21:02.361 --> 21:07.965
Am I more likely to get a UTI in
some sex positions-

21:07.967 --> 21:11.502
Sshh! What's that? You hear it?

21:11.504 --> 21:16.874

21:22.248 --> 21:24.414

21:24.416 --> 21:28.285
Have your mom buy you a new one.

I need more music.

21:33.526 --> 21:40.898
I need music in my life. Can you buy me
a new CD player.

21:40.900 --> 21:48.438
Ok. Um I feel like I pee during
an orgasm. What the fuck? What?

21:48.440 --> 21:49.206

22:11.263 --> 22:12.765
No way.

22:12.791 --> 22:15.532
This is way to fucking freaky.

22:15.534 --> 22:16.600
Come on where are you gonna go?

22:16.602 --> 22:18.656
With all this creepy shit
going on around here.

22:18.682 --> 22:19.469
Just calm down.

22:19.471 --> 22:22.439
I'm just gonna walk home.
I'm sorry girls.

22:42.994 --> 22:44.027

personal belongings on the road,

22:51.903 --> 22:53.337

22:56.875 --> 23:01.044
Dispatch, we got a
young girl's bag.

23:01.112 --> 23:03.046
So scattered clothes.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.619
Hello?

23:12.457 --> 23:13.223
Hello?

23:13.225 --> 23:20.564
Dispatch. Going out into the woods. I think
I may have found our missing person.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.001

23:26.337 --> 23:28.538
Hello? Desi?

23:29.207 --> 23:33.543

24:07.045 --> 24:08.679
Police officer.

24:22.026 --> 24:23.427
Oh Shit!

24:32.236 --> 24:37.607
Dispatch. I'm gonna need
another coroner on site.

24:39.243 --> 24:43.347
Send a forensic team.
We got another murder.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.692
Hey are you ok?

24:55.694 --> 25:00.297
Yeah. I'm ok I just...

25:00.299 --> 25:03.133
I can't believe she's gone.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.135
Yeah.

25:05.470 --> 25:08.739
What did-
What did the cops ask you?

25:08.741 --> 25:14.444
They just asked me like when she left
the house. If she left alone, I mean.

25:14.446 --> 25:18.348
Who saw her and if I know
if she was going anywhere.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.685
I mean we- she shouldn't have
left by herself obviously.

25:21.687 --> 25:24.957
No! I don't even know why
she left by herself.

25:24.983 --> 25:28.158
She knows not to walk
in the dark by herself.

25:28.160 --> 25:32.562
Yeah, well obviously a lot of
weird thing have been going on.

25:32.564 --> 25:36.333
And it's like, really
freaking me out.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.267
Yeah, what is going on?

25:37.269 --> 25:41.523
I don't know. I just knew
her for a couple days.

25:41.549 --> 25:44.474
But we became
really good friends

25:44.476 --> 25:45.776
and I'm just...

25:45.778 --> 25:48.578
I don't know.
It's just fucked up.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.047
It really is.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.682
School is going to
be really weird now.

25:52.684 --> 25:53.817
Not having her around.

25:53.819 --> 25:57.320
Well, You'll have-
You'll have me.

25:57.322 --> 25:59.089
I don't know what to say.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.426
Thanks for being here for me.
I really appreciate it.

26:02.428 --> 26:06.363
Of course I'll be there for you.

26:09.400 --> 26:13.437
What is your brother
doing in he background?

26:13.538 --> 26:14.538
Brandon!

26:14.540 --> 26:16.573
Get out!

26:17.208 --> 26:19.276
Can you hold on just one second?

26:19.278 --> 26:19.843
Yeah.

26:19.845 --> 26:23.146
Brandon! What is wrong with you!

26:24.348 --> 26:25.849
God!

26:26.517 --> 26:29.719
Why do you always have
to be in my room?

26:40.865 --> 26:42.866
Sorry. He's so annoying.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.267
It's ok.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.570
I don't have a brother so I
don't know what it's like.

26:46.572 --> 26:52.642
Well I could be like your sister.

26:52.644 --> 26:54.344
If that helps.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.746
Do you want to hang out later?

26:56.748 --> 26:57.481
Definitely.

26:57.483 --> 27:01.184
Awesome. It's hang out at your
house or something.

27:01.186 --> 27:05.422
Yeah. Yeah.
Come over like 5:30.

27:05.424 --> 27:06.389
Ok.

27:06.391 --> 27:06.790
Ok.

27:06.792 --> 27:07.824
Alright, see you then.

27:07.826 --> 27:10.227
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:33.619 --> 27:36.453
What were you doing?
Turn off the camera.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.321
Brandon stop it!

27:38.489 --> 27:41.391
Dana, What's going on?

27:41.393 --> 27:43.894
Brandon get out of here!

27:44.395 --> 27:46.496
And it's so scary.

27:58.177 --> 28:02.846
I'm right here.
Why don't you relax.

28:02.848 --> 28:08.284
She's soaking wet.

28:08.310 --> 28:10.312
I know.

28:12.623 --> 28:17.494
Keep breathing ok.
Nice deep breaths.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.896
God dammit Brandon get-

28:23.935 --> 28:25.969
Welcome to dressing with Dana.

28:25.971 --> 28:30.273
House edition. Where I show you
our brand new house.

28:30.275 --> 28:35.212
You see we haven't done all
the unpacking yet, but.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.613
Here's out.

28:37.648 --> 28:39.883
And there is my dad.

28:39.885 --> 28:43.920
Hopefully doing a
little more unpacking.

28:45.556 --> 28:46.990
Thank you.

28:47.592 --> 28:48.325
I found it.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.860
- You found it.
- I found it!

28:50.862 --> 28:53.230
What did you find?

28:54.633 --> 28:59.302
Janet! Baby!

28:59.870 --> 29:01.972
Baby. What's wrong?

29:02.473 --> 29:04.608
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

29:04.675 --> 29:05.375
I'm sorry.

29:05.377 --> 29:09.012
I heard something.
And it freaked me out and I fell.

29:09.347 --> 29:09.846
You're ok?

29:09.848 --> 29:11.548
Yeah. I'm fine.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.516
Jesus you scared
the shit outta me.

29:13.518 --> 29:16.786
We're never gonna
be finished unpacking.

29:16.788 --> 29:17.520
What scared you?

29:17.522 --> 29:21.691
I don't know. It was some
scratching or something.

29:21.693 --> 29:25.662
Like that!

29:25.664 --> 29:26.730
Yeah what was that?

29:26.732 --> 29:30.734
It sounds like it's up there.

29:33.739 --> 29:34.904
Maybe something is
stuck in there.

29:34.906 --> 29:39.909
- Like a mouse or something.
- There is something up there.

29:48.853 --> 29:50.487
I feel something.

29:51.989 --> 29:54.491
Please really be careful.

30:02.900 --> 30:03.733
You feel anything?

30:03.735 --> 30:05.635
- Yeah.
- What is it?

30:05.637 --> 30:06.436
I don't know.

30:07.706 --> 30:09.406
Ow! Fuck.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.541
Ouch! What the fuck?

30:11.543 --> 30:13.476
- Holy shit.
- Are you ok?

30:13.478 --> 30:16.379
No I'm not ok.

30:16.381 --> 30:18.581
- Let me get you upstairs.
- I'm gonna wash this off or something.

30:18.583 --> 30:23.853
I put the First Aid kit in
the bathroom upstairs ok.

30:30.094 --> 30:31.728
Hey Mom, Jumped
back to pictures?

30:31.730 --> 30:34.698
Hey baby. Yeah I found
the box finally.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.433
I've been searching for it.

30:36.435 --> 30:36.866
Yeah?

30:36.868 --> 30:38.068
Look at all these cards.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.069
You get some good ones in there?

30:39.071 --> 30:42.339
Yeah I do. I was going
through the cards first.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.474
Ah the cards.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.042
Oh shit.

30:46.044 --> 30:47.577
What?

30:47.945 --> 30:50.580
This picture is messed up.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.548
Let me see. Let me see.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.515
Look.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.450
Right there.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.486
It looks like it's underneath
the frame too.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.988
The originals? Did you
like get a digital?

30:58.990 --> 31:04.494
I might have them somewhere I'm not sure.
That would be yet in another box.

31:04.496 --> 31:05.462
I can only imagine.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.697
Look at this one.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.131
Again?

31:08.133 --> 31:08.998
I know that one too.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.101
That's really strange, may be
it's just the ones in the frames.

31:11.103 --> 31:15.652
Maybe just a broken pipe or
something and it went underneath

31:15.678 --> 31:16.973
It's just Dana.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.742
Maybe the camera hates Dana.

31:18.744 --> 31:19.476
Oh stop it.

31:19.478 --> 31:24.848
I can probably, I don't know I guess I
could scan them and fix them on Photoshop.

31:24.850 --> 31:25.715
Oh that's a bad one.

31:25.717 --> 31:32.689
Yeah look. It looks like... I don't know what
that would be. Is that mud? Is that water?

31:32.757 --> 31:33.623
It's not coming off.

31:33.625 --> 31:38.928
That one. Look how
cute she is too.

31:38.996 --> 31:41.664
I guess we are out of pictures
to hang on the mantel.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.167
Look at you. My baby.

31:44.169 --> 31:48.037
Oh yeah. The old camera.

31:48.039 --> 31:48.805
Movin' on up.

31:48.807 --> 31:52.609
That is way before your time.
That's way before my time.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.444
There's not a lot to do here.

31:54.446 --> 31:57.080
Awe man that was my favorite
picture of her too.

31:57.481 --> 31:58.448
Look look look.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.949
Staring off angrily at me.

31:59.951 --> 32:02.886
Probably. Odds are.

32:02.888 --> 32:05.522
I'm sure you did something to
piss her off.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.123
Yes like being born.

32:07.125 --> 32:07.724
Stop it.

32:07.726 --> 32:11.795
So dad, are you bummed you didn't
get to go to San Francisco with us?

32:11.929 --> 32:15.865
Yeah. But I had to
stay for work though.

32:15.867 --> 32:16.733
It was fun though?

32:16.735 --> 32:17.667
Oh it was so much fun.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.702
We did the trolley.
We did the wharf.

32:19.704 --> 32:22.605
Ok I got some trivia.
You like trivia?

32:22.607 --> 32:25.575
I love trivia.
I am the master of trivia.

32:26.877 --> 32:33.049
The cable cars are the only national
monument that that is able to be moved.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.651
Wait. They are a
national monument?

32:34.653 --> 32:36.119
They are a national monument.

32:36.121 --> 32:36.786
Really?

32:36.788 --> 32:37.220
Yeah.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.087
I did not know that.

32:38.089 --> 32:38.955
Yeah that's awesome.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.190
You've stumped the
king of trivia.

32:40.192 --> 32:40.924
Well played.

32:40.926 --> 32:42.525
Yeah I know. Your never gonna
win the next one.

32:42.527 --> 32:45.962
Pier 39 was cool. But the Bridge was the
best part. The Bridge was amazing.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.312
It was really cool.

32:47.338 --> 32:52.702
You can park right next to it and like
walk around all these old military-

32:52.704 --> 32:54.070
Holy shit!

32:54.072 --> 32:56.139
What was that?

32:57.041 --> 32:59.209
That is gross!

32:59.211 --> 33:01.044
Oh my god it smells!

33:01.046 --> 33:02.846
Eeww! Oh god.

33:02.848 --> 33:05.181
Did you get it in you mouth?

33:05.616 --> 33:06.683
Eeewww!!

33:06.685 --> 33:08.718
You got it in your mouth!

33:08.720 --> 33:09.486
What was that?

33:09.488 --> 33:11.855
Oh my god. What is that?

33:11.857 --> 33:12.522
Oh god.

33:12.524 --> 33:13.857
It smells like a dead animal.

33:13.859 --> 33:14.657
Move move move.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.259
- Did it get all over the place?
- Disgusting.

33:16.261 --> 33:19.529
Nice pipes dad. Really nice
pipes in this house.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.631
What the hell was that?

33:23.267 --> 33:24.567
That's gross.

33:24.569 --> 33:27.446
That looks like one of your
giant dumps all over you.

33:27.472 --> 33:28.671
That's disgusting.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.540
Turn that camera off.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.545
Eww! You see that?

33:35.547 --> 33:38.681
Yeah that's gross.
Don't touch it.

33:39.083 --> 33:40.884
Don't touch it!

33:42.853 --> 33:45.622
That's the same stuff
from the sink.

33:45.624 --> 33:46.990
It is?

33:47.525 --> 33:52.762
You think out septic tank
in backed up or what?

33:54.565 --> 33:56.666
I don't know what this is?

33:57.234 --> 33:59.702
Well does it smell like poop?

33:59.970 --> 34:02.071
It doesn't smell good.

34:04.608 --> 34:08.143
I don't know. I think we might
need a plumber or something.

34:08.746 --> 34:09.846
Great.

34:17.922 --> 34:22.824
Ok. So looking at the
Bell Witch legend here.

34:22.827 --> 34:27.764
Hauntings that took place in
this guy home. In the Bell home.

34:27.766 --> 34:30.699
With people being pinched.
Stuff being thrown.

34:30.702 --> 34:36.339
Um, Animals being spooked.
Objects moving and not moving.

34:36.341 --> 34:39.208
Uh the reason this is
significant is...

34:39.210 --> 34:43.880
If we were to look at good ol'
Robertson county here.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.181
Adams was previously
know as red river.

34:46.184 --> 34:52.357
And back in the 1800s this entire area,
was owned and farmed by the very own

34:54.359 --> 34:59.929
pastor of the church John Bell.
As in, the Bell witch.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.831
You are living on his property.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.099
No way.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.069
Yeah. 200 years later.

35:07.605 --> 35:08.004
So...

35:08.006 --> 35:09.238
So this is his property?

35:09.240 --> 35:10.139
This is his property.

35:10.141 --> 35:12.375
My dad bought the property
of the Bell Witch.

35:12.377 --> 35:18.214
Yeah well he had a lot of property.
He was big estate plantation type farm.

35:18.216 --> 35:22.752
It seems pretty legit dude.
Andrew Jackson Visited the home.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.288
You recording this. Umhm.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.723
There's a picture of her.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.758
So he won his precedence.

35:28.760 --> 35:29.192
Umhm.

35:29.194 --> 35:32.161
And he died in 1820 and apparently
the ghost stuck around and haunted

35:32.163 --> 35:37.233
the daughter and would say things to her.
People could hear her singing.

35:37.235 --> 35:41.904
And it took voice of a weak
old woman at one point.

35:41.906 --> 35:42.872
- What?
- Pretty interesting.

35:42.874 --> 35:47.210
And it all started when he found
and animal half dog half rabbit.

35:47.212 --> 35:51.080
He said he shot at it but it got
away. And ever since then his

35:51.082 --> 35:54.183
whole family has
been terrorized.

35:54.251 --> 35:56.152
He found an animal?

35:56.154 --> 35:57.654
Like the one that
found in the woods?

35:57.656 --> 36:00.189
The head of a rabbit
and the body of a dog.

36:00.191 --> 36:02.291
Is there a picture? Can we see?

36:02.293 --> 36:03.192
There we go.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.827
Holy Shit.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.296
That's a creepy little bitch.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.799
So this is like your
guys thing here.

36:09.801 --> 36:10.900
You guys have the Bell Witch.

36:10.902 --> 36:14.003
The Bell... I didn't realize it was this
close. I mean I've heard of it but

36:14.005 --> 36:17.040
I didn't realize it was
this close to home.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.775
Literally. Home.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.443
Yeah home.

36:21.745 --> 36:22.178
Shit.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.914
Have you see any of this stuff in
your house since you been here?

36:24.916 --> 36:29.419
I mean I haven't seen a witch. Flying
around on a broomstick or anything.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.888
Have you seen, have
you heard anything?

36:31.890 --> 36:33.122
There has been some
scratching sounds.

36:33.124 --> 36:36.859
My sister has having night terrors.
She's been freakin' out dude.

36:36.861 --> 36:37.727
Like what happened?

36:37.729 --> 36:41.097
She's been yelling craziness.
Like crazy shit.

36:41.099 --> 36:41.931
Ok listen to this.

36:41.933 --> 36:45.034
The children of John Bell said they could hear
and feel things while they were sleeping at

36:45.036 --> 36:50.039
night. Like covers being pulled. Pillows
being moved while they were sitting there.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.041
Yeah when they were sleeping.

36:52.043 --> 36:52.475
What?

36:52.477 --> 36:53.743
Did she say anything like that?

36:53.745 --> 36:58.214
No. She was just yelling and freaking out.
She like really stressed out now.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.115
She's like mega bitch.

36:59.117 --> 37:02.251
I heard some scratching at the door the
other night and I thought it was Dana

37:02.253 --> 37:03.286
and she was asleep.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.320
That's creepy. That's creepy.

37:04.322 --> 37:07.757
It is. There has been some weird
shit happening around here actually.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.992
Does this bother you?
Have you heard anything?

37:09.994 --> 37:13.763
I mean, it's like whatever
it could be a mouse.

37:13.765 --> 37:14.997
This house is a piece
of shit anyways.

37:14.999 --> 37:21.904
There's sludge. My dad got slimmed by the sink.
Looked like the sink threw up on him.

37:21.906 --> 37:22.338
Gross.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.106
It was gross man.

37:23.108 --> 37:26.242
Hey what if it is?
What if this is the Bell Witch?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.376
This is the Bell Witch.

37:27.378 --> 37:29.412
There has been no good
documentation of it.

37:29.414 --> 37:34.884
I mean it was 200 years ago. The only
accounts they have are a diary and book.

37:34.886 --> 37:35.752
From like 200 years ago.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.054
I got some cameras. I got some little cameras
that I could put on to of the house.

37:38.056 --> 37:41.390
That's what I'm saying. We could like
capture this. This could be our movie.

37:41.392 --> 37:43.493
This could be our movie man.

37:43.495 --> 37:44.994
Fuck bigfoot.
Let's get the Bell Witch.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.231
We can do like some paranormal
investigation type stuff. Security Cams.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.767
You know what I'm saying.
We just leave them running at night.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.169
See what happens, then we
come back and watch it.

37:53.171 --> 37:53.936
Ok yeah yeah.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.773
- We got this magic daddy.
- This thing is gonna catch some good stuff.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.341
I'm saying.
That would be awesome!

37:58.343 --> 37:59.242
That would be awesome.

37:59.244 --> 38:02.311
But we should put up some
security cameras like right now.

38:02.313 --> 38:04.147
- I'm down.
- Let's go do it man.

38:04.149 --> 38:05.047
Let's do it.

38:05.049 --> 38:07.116
Let's do it.

38:10.888 --> 38:14.190
Hang on a sec.

38:16.126 --> 38:17.360
I got it.

38:17.995 --> 38:18.795
How's that?

38:18.797 --> 38:23.432
That's perfect.
I'm bringing on that last one.

41:21.612 --> 41:23.145
What's going on?

41:48.206 --> 41:50.673
Michael go after her!
Go go go!

41:50.675 --> 41:53.442
Talk to me.

41:57.681 --> 42:01.017
Mom! Mom come here.
It's doing it again!

42:01.019 --> 42:01.450
What?

42:01.452 --> 42:03.652
The light! It's doing it again!

42:03.654 --> 42:05.721
Oh Ok. Hold on one second.

42:05.723 --> 42:09.191
Hurry up this is awesome.

42:19.603 --> 42:20.736
Oh it is.

42:22.439 --> 42:23.773
Oh shit. Ok.

42:28.245 --> 42:30.813
Ouch! Fuck fuck fuck!

42:30.815 --> 42:33.382
Are you ok? Are you ok?

42:40.625 --> 42:42.458

42:47.465 --> 42:49.331
I'm gonna go get Band-Aids ok.

42:49.333 --> 42:50.266

42:50.268 --> 42:52.568

43:10.555 --> 43:14.179
So today, interesting
problem we got here.

43:14.205 --> 43:18.561
First thing we like to do
is take a look at the box

43:18.563 --> 43:19.195
Yeah.

43:19.197 --> 43:24.166
Oh yeah, This looks like, pretty
much uh a standard problem we got.

43:24.168 --> 43:27.336
Already I'm seeing some problem.
This is a conjugate coming here.

43:27.338 --> 43:31.440
And here we see and exposed ground wire.
That thing can be HOT.

43:31.442 --> 43:36.512
That's a hot thing. We got our breaker
that seems to be in very good condition.

43:36.514 --> 43:37.847
This is relatively a new
box as you can see.

43:37.849 --> 43:41.750
This thing is hot right here.
Looks like this might be the problem.

43:58.136 --> 43:59.201
Dad!

43:59.369 --> 43:59.835
Dad!

44:03.708 --> 44:06.842
Brandon Brandon! Don't
touch him get back!

44:08.578 --> 44:09.879
Oh my god!

44:10.714 --> 44:13.282
Jesus Christ.

44:17.320 --> 44:19.622
Go call 9-1-1.

46:15.039 --> 46:16.438
Wake up Wake up!

46:18.609 --> 46:19.642
Wake up! Wake up!

46:29.720 --> 46:32.354
It's alright. It's ok.

46:32.589 --> 46:35.958
It's just a bad dream baby.
It's just a bad dream.

46:40.531 --> 46:45.000
- You ok. You ok.
- We're right with you ok?

46:45.368 --> 46:46.735
You're safe.

46:46.803 --> 46:49.071
Michael I swear to god.

46:49.372 --> 46:52.908
Alright let's not
do this right now,

46:52.910 --> 46:54.777
It's ok baby It's ok.

46:54.779 --> 46:56.779
It's just a bad dream alright.

46:56.781 --> 46:58.981
It's just a bad dream.

47:05.655 --> 47:07.790
Are you going to be ok?

47:09.826 --> 47:11.760
I think so.

47:11.961 --> 47:14.830
Do you want to talk
to me about anything?

47:15.765 --> 47:17.099
Not really.

47:17.101 --> 47:19.068
Here you go baby.

47:19.436 --> 47:20.969
Here's some water.

47:21.037 --> 47:21.737
Thank you.

47:21.739 --> 47:22.971
Feeling a little better?

47:22.973 --> 47:24.673
Uh huh.

47:24.675 --> 47:27.343
Ok. I love you.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.745
You call me if you
need anything ok?

47:29.747 --> 47:31.080
Ok.

47:35.752 --> 47:37.920
Was it that witch again?

47:40.390 --> 47:41.423
Yeah.

47:41.425 --> 47:43.459
Is there a cave?

47:44.427 --> 47:44.927
Umhm.

47:44.929 --> 47:47.863
If you ever need to talk to
me about anything, you can.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.398
You know that.

47:49.400 --> 47:50.833
I'm here.

47:51.101 --> 47:52.034
Thanks.

47:52.036 --> 47:53.102
Always.

47:53.104 --> 47:54.837
I love you.

47:54.839 --> 47:57.005
To the mood and back.

47:57.674 --> 47:58.841
Hey Brandon?

47:58.843 --> 48:01.110
Yeah?

48:01.112 --> 48:03.379
I love you too.

48:03.480 --> 48:07.950
And... I'm sorry I'm
such a bitch sometimes.

48:07.952 --> 48:11.820
It's ok. I can take it.

48:15.925 --> 48:20.429
You got to see this. You got to see this.
I put together a little something with

48:20.431 --> 48:21.930
the footage I've gotten.

48:21.932 --> 48:23.665
Alright. Cool.

48:23.867 --> 48:25.100
Wait.

48:31.007 --> 48:31.607
Ok.

48:31.609 --> 48:36.945
Looks like. Looks like some is coming
through the kitchen to the dining room.

48:36.947 --> 48:37.780
To the living room

48:37.782 --> 48:39.014
Yeah. That is the
order of the house.

48:39.016 --> 48:41.083
- It takes like the path.
- That's right.

48:41.085 --> 48:45.721
And then it goes out in
her room and it's out.

48:47.624 --> 48:48.123
It is out.

48:48.125 --> 48:48.991
It ends in her room.

48:48.993 --> 48:51.093
And there is no body here. And there
like no body messing with the cameras.

48:51.095 --> 48:53.962
That's pretty freaky. That's the
same room the night terrors were in?

48:53.964 --> 48:55.564
Yeah that's the same room
the night terrors are in.

48:55.566 --> 49:02.438
Well. I think the next step is to go out
and get some footage in the woods again.

49:02.440 --> 49:06.074
- Right?
- Yes. Let's go find the cave.

49:06.076 --> 49:06.708
I uh-

49:06.710 --> 49:11.213
asked my parents and they
got me this camera as well.

49:11.215 --> 49:15.851
What do you go there?
What do you got there?

49:15.853 --> 49:18.520
Is that, Panacrapic?

49:18.522 --> 49:20.189
Is that a dent?

49:20.191 --> 49:22.090
Does it come with a dent?

49:22.092 --> 49:27.095
Um- yeah.
I didn't get it new you know.

49:27.097 --> 49:28.931
Clearly. Clearly you didn't.

49:28.933 --> 49:31.166
Let's go.
Does it at least record?

49:31.168 --> 49:33.602
It's recording.
I'm rolling right now.

49:33.604 --> 49:36.104
Good. Alright come on. Let's go.

49:37.874 --> 49:40.542
I'm recording. Alright.

49:43.112 --> 49:45.781
Let's go do this.
Let's go find a witch.

49:45.783 --> 49:48.917
Still gotta finish
unpacking all our shit.

49:51.054 --> 49:52.120
You got a lot of stuff.

49:52.122 --> 49:53.155
You got a lot of stuff to do.

49:53.157 --> 49:58.894
Yeah. The interesting activities have
been keeping them from unpacking.

49:58.896 --> 50:00.028
Alright.

50:00.030 --> 50:02.164
That's Dana's room.

50:02.765 --> 50:03.866
Try to sneak a peek.

50:03.868 --> 50:07.736
She's got it boarded it up.

50:07.738 --> 50:08.971
Scare the shit out of her.

50:08.973 --> 50:13.141
Your neighbors are not much
for cleaning are they?

50:13.143 --> 50:15.043
Kinda looks like your house.

50:15.045 --> 50:15.811
Shut up.

50:17.147 --> 50:19.515
Home sweet home gulp.

50:20.884 --> 50:21.717
It's kinda creepy.

50:21.719 --> 50:25.053
This is old John Bell's property.

50:25.055 --> 50:26.121
All this stuff.

50:26.123 --> 50:30.559
If there's a witch she probably
hates all this shit out here.

50:30.727 --> 50:33.695
All John Bells property.

50:35.865 --> 50:40.269
Coby what do you think? You think
there's an actual witch out here?

50:40.271 --> 50:40.869
Brandon!

50:40.871 --> 50:42.204
Holy shit mom!

50:42.206 --> 50:43.071
What are you doing?

50:43.073 --> 50:44.940
We're gonna go
hiking in the woods.

50:44.942 --> 50:46.775
No I really need you inside.
Hi Coby.

50:46.777 --> 50:49.111

50:49.113 --> 50:49.845
Mom come on!

50:49.847 --> 50:53.615

I need you to help me unpacking the house.

50:53.617 --> 50:54.983
- Please we wanna go find something.
- Real quick.

50:54.985 --> 51:01.123
No. I'm sorry Coby. Absolutely not.
He has things to do inside and he know it.

51:01.125 --> 51:02.991
Get your butt inside.

51:02.993 --> 51:03.725

51:03.727 --> 51:04.082
Ok.

51:04.108 --> 51:04.793

51:04.795 --> 51:05.627

51:05.629 --> 51:06.695
Alright I'll meet you in there.

51:06.697 --> 51:07.729
Alright, I'll meet you inside.

51:07.731 --> 51:12.701
Hey I'm gonna do. And it looks
like it's about to rain.

51:12.703 --> 51:13.268
Yeah it does.

51:13.270 --> 51:15.938
Let me go uh ... Let me go get
some stuff.

51:15.940 --> 51:17.673
Be careful.

51:17.675 --> 51:18.106
Yeah.

51:18.108 --> 51:18.941
Good luck Brother.

51:18.943 --> 51:20.208
Hey you mind if I
take the backpack?

51:20.210 --> 51:21.076
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

51:21.078 --> 51:25.314
Alright, I'm go get what I can before
it starts raining or the sun goes down.

51:25.316 --> 51:25.981
And uh-

51:25.983 --> 51:28.317
If you find any other animals
make sure that you video tape it.

51:28.319 --> 51:29.751
Oh yeah defiantly.

51:29.753 --> 51:30.252
Ok?

51:30.254 --> 51:30.886
Cool.

51:30.888 --> 51:34.189
- Don't get killed by Christy.
- Ok we'll rendezvous back tonight.

51:35.024 --> 51:36.358
Here we are.

51:36.360 --> 51:38.360
Back in the woods.

51:40.863 --> 51:42.364
It's getting dark.

51:43.032 --> 51:46.101
It's kinda creepy
this time of night.

51:46.369 --> 51:48.203
Here's the river bed.

51:52.008 --> 51:56.612
This is where we're gonna film
the forestman prophecies.

51:56.614 --> 51:58.113
My first break through film.

51:58.115 --> 52:03.719
This is where about the animal,
dead animal should have been.

52:06.856 --> 52:08.023
Yep.

52:08.358 --> 52:09.791
It was right here.

52:09.793 --> 52:10.926
Just like I thought.

52:10.928 --> 52:13.028
Something dragged it of.

52:15.865 --> 52:17.899
But the blood is still there.

52:39.957 --> 52:41.156
I heard a noise.

53:07.684 --> 53:10.852
I got woken up by Lisa
asking where Coby was.

53:10.854 --> 53:12.120
Weren't you two suppose
to be together?

53:12.122 --> 53:17.228
Uh yeah. We were gonna go hiking but mom
made me come inside to put some boxes away.

53:20.329 --> 53:22.764
We were gonna go look for this
cave.

53:22.766 --> 53:23.265
Cave?

53:23.267 --> 53:28.470
Yeah, we were doing some research and
there is suppose to be a cave somewhere

53:28.472 --> 53:29.905
on our property.

53:29.907 --> 53:33.041
You haven't heard from him? He hasn't
called you or text you anything?

53:33.043 --> 53:35.944
No no I haven't heard
from him at all.

53:40.216 --> 53:43.118
Damn woods. I hate the woods.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.754
You wanted to move to the woods.

53:46.723 --> 53:49.224
Hey wait a minute, what's this?

53:49.492 --> 53:50.225

head loft from the flights of heaven.

Seducer of man, betrayer of the nations.
Instigator of envy.
