00:21.000 --> 00:22.708
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:28.916 --> 00:30.166
Where am I?

00:32.833 --> 00:35.458
AUDITION VENUE
FOR THEATER TROUPE ACTORS OF MEET

00:40.333 --> 00:41.375
I don't even care.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.583
FESTIVAL CITY THEATER

00:49.083 --> 00:50.291
Hey.

00:50.791 --> 00:51.708
Miss.

00:52.333 --> 00:53.583
The gate is that way.

00:54.166 --> 00:55.041
Sir.

00:55.125 --> 00:57.166
I need you to hold this railing.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.541
Please. Just for a second.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.166
I'll be quick. Please. Thank you.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.375
I'll thank you on stage
when I win an award.

01:02.958 --> 01:04.541
Sir, I'm really sorry!

01:05.875 --> 01:07.208
Thank you, sir.

01:10.833 --> 01:12.375
Sorry, I'm late.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.333
Excuse me, can I still audition?

01:14.416 --> 01:15.916
The audition is over.

01:16.875 --> 01:17.833
I'm sorry.

01:17.916 --> 01:19.416
I prepared a lot for this.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.416
Can you give me a chance?

01:22.208 --> 01:24.708
-You're Huang Shu-hui, right?
-Yes.

01:24.791 --> 01:26.041
Please.

01:26.125 --> 01:28.416
I don't mind. But our audio guy just left.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.375
It's okay. I'm still here.

01:33.375 --> 01:34.291
Come on.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.250
<i>The moment we met,</i>

01:40.708 --> 01:42.875
I thought we'd be together forever.

01:46.625 --> 01:48.333
You said

01:48.416 --> 01:50.458
you would always stay by my side,

01:51.583 --> 01:53.708
no matter how willful I am.

01:55.666 --> 01:57.500
I used to think

01:59.041 --> 02:02.583
loving someone with all my might

02:03.333 --> 02:04.875
is the saddest thing.

02:06.541 --> 02:08.833
-But after I was hurt, again and again,
<i>-But after I was hurt, again and again,</i>

02:08.916 --> 02:10.708
-that's when I realized
<i>-that's when I realized</i>

02:11.708 --> 02:14.958
-trying my best to forget about that love…
<i>-trying my best to forget about that love…</i>

02:19.583 --> 02:23.083
-That is even sadder than sad.
<i>-That is even sadder than sad.</i>

02:29.125 --> 02:33.625
STRANDED RELATIONSHIPS

02:44.250 --> 02:45.166
Ke-le!

02:45.708 --> 02:46.958
Ke-le!

02:48.500 --> 02:49.541
Ke-le!

02:50.458 --> 02:51.625
Ke-le!

02:57.500 --> 02:59.083
Hello? I need an ambulance.

03:06.416 --> 03:09.166
What? I was pooping.

03:14.958 --> 03:16.833
WHAT IS THE SURFACE AREA
FOR THE CYLINDER BELOW?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.833
You texted me "Help"
because you had a problem

03:21.916 --> 03:22.958
with your homework?

03:23.541 --> 03:24.625
I thought something happened to you.

03:24.708 --> 03:27.041
You said I could talk
to you about anything.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.708
I only said, "Help."

03:28.791 --> 03:30.000
I didn't say something's wrong.

03:32.125 --> 03:33.708
Just help me with this one.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.375
Why isn't it 30 times 15?

03:39.041 --> 03:41.458
It's the surface area of the cylinder.

03:41.541 --> 03:43.625
It's not a cube. You have to use the pi.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.416
But if "pi" is just a number,

03:46.500 --> 03:48.250
why isn't the result a number?

03:48.333 --> 03:50.125
Why do you care?

03:50.666 --> 03:52.250
You can still find an answer, right?

03:53.416 --> 03:54.333
Right.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.958
And the answer is in the last few pages.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.125
There's no answer.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.333
Where did it go?

04:01.291 --> 04:02.708
The teacher ripped it off.

04:05.583 --> 04:07.250
It's ripped off so you can't cheat.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.708
It's 3.14. It says right here.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.500
MY STREET VIEW MAP

04:16.583 --> 04:18.541
Your homework is way too complicated.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.166
You have to use Street View?

04:22.875 --> 04:24.416
It's the outside of your house, right?

04:24.500 --> 04:25.416
Yes.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.083
And the place where Mom works.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.250
Type "E Shine."

04:31.333 --> 04:33.166
-"E."
-The first one. Yes.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.750
And my dad's workplace too.

04:39.458 --> 04:40.958
But I don't have a dad.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.458
Just write the same place.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.333
I see.

04:48.458 --> 04:50.541
"A country I want to visit."

04:50.625 --> 04:51.708
Where do you want to go?

04:52.291 --> 04:54.291
I want to go to Tokyo Disneyland.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.500
Because I'm sick,

04:59.541 --> 05:02.750
I can't go to amusement parks.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.500
An Yi-chi rarely took me on trips.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.500
Don't tell me you're pitying me.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.791
-If there's nothing else, I'll get going.
-Hold on.

05:19.583 --> 05:20.791
What?

05:22.541 --> 05:23.750
What are you laughing at?

05:26.625 --> 05:27.791
An Ke-le, I'm home.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.000
An Yi-chi, he's so bad at this.

05:30.083 --> 05:32.791
It's my first time feeling sleepy
playing games.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.083
Po-han?

05:34.166 --> 05:35.958
Why are you here?

05:38.500 --> 05:39.458
An Ke-le.

05:39.541 --> 05:41.250
Are you harassing others?

05:41.333 --> 05:43.416
Didn't I tell you
not to bother other people?

05:43.500 --> 05:44.916
Have you done your homework?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.625
Go and take a shower.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.000
I asked for help with my homework.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.833
He was the one who wanted to play.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.333
And he lost to me.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.500
I let you win, okay?

05:52.583 --> 05:54.625
-Then let's do another round.
-Bring it.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.000
-Press start.
-Okay.

05:56.625 --> 05:57.458
Let's go.

06:00.291 --> 06:01.291
Look at the time.

06:01.375 --> 06:02.500
Go and take a shower.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.250
Okay.

06:11.416 --> 06:12.583
Po-han.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.333
I'm sorry.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.583
Ke-le bothered you when you're busy.

06:17.291 --> 06:18.750
You should go home and rest.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.083
Okay.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.166
What's the matter?

06:38.791 --> 06:40.416
The diary.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.583
I need K's diary.

06:43.916 --> 06:45.750
I'd like to read the diary.

06:46.458 --> 06:47.416
Okay.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.666
Damn it.

07:00.041 --> 07:01.500
Thank you for playing with Ke-le.

07:02.083 --> 07:04.000
I haven't seen him
smile like that in a long time.

07:06.916 --> 07:09.333
Don't work this weekend.

07:09.875 --> 07:10.916
Spend some time with him.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.000
Even though he can't go
to the amusement park,

07:15.500 --> 07:18.166
you can still show him around.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.333
Okay.

07:21.083 --> 07:22.000
I'm going.

07:24.125 --> 07:25.250
Bye.

07:52.625 --> 07:56.291
<i>I'm not much of a lover</i>

07:56.375 --> 07:59.833
<i>But if I were to write a poem</i>

08:00.833 --> 08:04.166
<i>Mae, my first poem</i>

08:04.250 --> 08:07.291
<i>Would be about you</i>

08:08.458 --> 08:11.875
<i>I'm not much of a lover</i>

08:11.958 --> 08:15.666
<i>But if I were to write a poem</i>

08:16.458 --> 08:19.666
<i>Mae, my first poem</i>

08:19.750 --> 08:23.250
<i>Would be about you</i>

08:33.958 --> 08:35.250
It makes you emotional

08:35.333 --> 08:36.833
while recording this song.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.875
Thank you. I love this song too.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.958
That's why it has to be on the album.

08:41.041 --> 08:42.958
Can I listen to the recording?

08:43.041 --> 08:44.000
No problem.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.125
Please.

08:50.208 --> 08:51.041
Po-han.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.208
Good work, everyone. Have some coffee.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.333
Hold it.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.583
-You've worked hard.
-Thank you.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.750
Come.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.666
Thank you.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.958
How did you find time to come here?

09:06.041 --> 09:06.958
I'm free today.

09:07.041 --> 09:08.583
I just wanted to see Po-han.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.541
I miss him.

09:10.625 --> 09:11.958
Right, A-Lin.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.208
Let me ask you something.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.666
Did you find anyone for your music video?

09:15.750 --> 09:17.125
If you haven't,

09:17.208 --> 09:18.166
what about me?

09:18.916 --> 09:21.166
You know, working with a new company,

09:21.250 --> 09:23.583
if you're not careful,
you'll end up like me,

09:23.666 --> 09:25.041
a has-been actress.

09:25.125 --> 09:26.208
However,

09:26.291 --> 09:28.875
having something to promote
will make things different.

09:28.958 --> 09:30.416
Think about it.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.958
If I'm the lead actress,

09:32.041 --> 09:34.375
and he's the producer.

09:34.458 --> 09:35.958
Since we're a couple,

09:36.458 --> 09:38.583
isn't that more appealing?

09:38.666 --> 09:41.916
We need to discuss this
with the marketing specialist.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.416
Is that you?

09:43.500 --> 09:44.583
Can we schedule it?

09:44.666 --> 09:46.541
-Li-na, I need to talk to you.
-I--

09:46.625 --> 09:47.875
A-Lin, I'm sorry.

09:51.916 --> 09:53.166
What are you doing?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.458
I'm visiting you at work.

09:55.541 --> 09:56.625
You're doing this on purpose.

09:56.708 --> 09:58.083
No, I'm not.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.833
I really missed you a lot.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.333
I can smell it. You're drinking again.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.916
I drank in the morning.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.291
Do you know what time it is now?

10:06.375 --> 10:07.625
I'm sober now.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.125
I don't care if you're sober or not.

10:10.208 --> 10:11.833
Let me tell you one last time.

10:11.916 --> 10:13.291
We broke up.

10:13.375 --> 10:14.208
Please.

10:14.291 --> 10:15.708
Stop pestering me.

10:16.458 --> 10:17.958
When did I pester you?

10:18.041 --> 10:19.875
Do you have to be so cruel to me?

10:19.958 --> 10:22.500
I only did one thing wrong.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.375
Please give me one more chance.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.000
-I'll--
-I don't want to talk.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.458
As you saw, I still have work to do.

10:27.541 --> 10:28.708
That's it, okay?

10:29.958 --> 10:32.708
-I'm sorry. Let me finish.
-Huang Shu-hui!

10:33.666 --> 10:35.083
-Sorry, I didn't--
-Ms. Kung.

10:35.166 --> 10:36.041
Don't come near me.

10:42.333 --> 10:43.250
Wang Po-han.

10:44.041 --> 10:47.583
I get why you can't write
a moving song now.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.125
It's because you only love yourself.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.500
You're a selfish bastard.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.083
That's why he can only write cheesy songs.

11:09.208 --> 11:11.250
I'm sorry. I got held up at work.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.375
It's okay.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.041
I understand.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.416
I'm sorry.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.500
Don't be mad.

11:22.166 --> 11:24.791
I know you've been fired. I'm upset too.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.083
Don't lie to me.

11:27.166 --> 11:29.000
A successful person like you,

11:29.083 --> 11:31.791
how would you know how losers feel?

11:36.750 --> 11:39.166
Do you know
how long I have prepared for this role?

11:40.166 --> 11:42.333
It's my first time playing the lead role.

11:43.708 --> 11:46.416
But they just replaced me like that.
Why would they do that?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.916
The auditions were all fake.

12:09.333 --> 12:10.333
Hello.

12:10.416 --> 12:12.458
-Who are you looking for?
-I'm seeing Director Hsu.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.375
-Director Hsu.
-Po-han.

12:15.041 --> 12:16.583
Director Hsu, it has been a while.

12:16.666 --> 12:18.291
What is it today?

12:18.833 --> 12:21.916
I came to ask you
some questions about Li-na.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.500
Can you reconsider it?

12:24.583 --> 12:26.041
Po-han.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.625
I'll be straightforward. Don't mind it.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.750
Li-na is a good actress.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.500
She's very dedicated to her performance.

12:35.041 --> 12:36.916
But to be honest, as we all know,

12:37.000 --> 12:38.458
she has a drinking problem.

12:39.958 --> 12:41.750
The production team was worried

12:41.833 --> 12:43.041
that during filming,

12:43.125 --> 12:45.000
her condition might affect our work.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.166
We couldn't take that chance.

12:48.208 --> 12:51.208
Director Hsu,
I can talk to her on this matter.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.125
Or maybe…

12:53.208 --> 12:55.083
Have you found your soundtracks yet?

12:56.208 --> 12:57.875
If you don't mind,

12:57.958 --> 12:59.500
I'm willing to help.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.208
Please…

13:02.291 --> 13:04.041
Please give her

13:04.125 --> 13:05.750
one more chance.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.958
Li-na.

13:13.541 --> 13:15.208
I have good news.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.625
I was on the street,
and I met Director Hsu.

13:17.708 --> 13:18.916
<i>So?</i>

13:19.000 --> 13:21.291
They still want you
to be the lead actress.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.416
<i>Seriously?</i>

13:25.041 --> 13:26.958
<i>Stop joking around.</i>

13:27.041 --> 13:29.000
It's real. I'm not lying.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.458
<i>My goodness. It will be my treat today.</i>

13:32.666 --> 13:34.708
<i>I can act now!</i>

13:34.791 --> 13:36.958
Anyway, let's talk in person.

13:37.041 --> 13:39.416
<i>-Okay. See you later.</i>
-Okay. Bye.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.250
Hello?

14:02.333 --> 14:04.250
<i>Hey, Po-han. I'm Li-na's manager, Amy.</i>

14:04.333 --> 14:05.708
<i>Have you seen Li-na?</i>

14:06.500 --> 14:08.458
Didn't she have work at 5:30 a.m.?

14:08.541 --> 14:10.041
She's not at my place.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.250
<i>But she's not there yet.</i>

14:11.333 --> 14:12.750
<i>And she's not answering her phone.</i>

14:12.833 --> 14:14.458
<i>Director Hsu is very mad.</i>

14:15.291 --> 14:17.000
Okay. I'll help you find her.

14:17.083 --> 14:18.333
Bye.

15:00.458 --> 15:02.000
<i>Even though I knew</i>

15:02.083 --> 15:03.666
<i>that in relationships,</i>

15:03.750 --> 15:05.833
<i>you might not get anything
in return for your efforts,</i>

15:07.333 --> 15:09.208
<i>I couldn't help thinking</i>

15:10.416 --> 15:12.250
<i>that if we did something more,</i>

15:13.541 --> 15:15.541
<i>would we have a different outcome?</i>

15:28.333 --> 15:29.458
I'm sorry.

15:31.166 --> 15:32.916
I thought everything I did

15:33.791 --> 15:36.000
was all for our future.

15:44.666 --> 15:46.375
I've thought it through.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.583
I shouldn't have put

15:50.666 --> 15:52.625
my hopes in you.

15:57.625 --> 15:58.958
We should break up.

16:02.416 --> 16:04.416
I think it's about time
I come to my senses.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.000
Is it because of the pictures?

16:14.791 --> 16:16.000
Not entirely.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.916
But it made me realize

16:24.791 --> 16:26.958
we're living in different worlds.

16:38.875 --> 16:41.500
I came here to break up with you too.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.208
Since we share the same thought then…

16:47.125 --> 16:48.250
All right.

17:00.416 --> 17:01.416
I wish you happiness.

17:28.541 --> 17:29.833
I think

17:31.083 --> 17:32.291
we broke up.

17:35.916 --> 17:37.125
Why?

17:44.750 --> 17:45.958
Well…

17:49.291 --> 17:50.625
I was betrayed.

17:52.541 --> 17:53.833
It's lame, right?

18:07.125 --> 18:08.791
Let me tell you a story.

18:12.916 --> 18:15.583
One day, when I was in high school,

18:15.666 --> 18:18.708
my teacher suddenly barged in
and brought me to the hospital.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.625
And then I found out

18:22.125 --> 18:25.000
that my dad, my mom, and my sister

18:26.583 --> 18:28.291
had just died in a car accident.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.541
Then I started living with K.

18:34.375 --> 18:36.166
He became my only family.

18:37.375 --> 18:38.625
Sometimes,

18:38.708 --> 18:40.625
he's like an older brother to me.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.833
Sometimes,

18:43.916 --> 18:45.000
he's like a dad.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.125
Sometimes, a mom.

18:48.625 --> 18:49.791
Sometimes,

18:53.375 --> 18:54.791
he's like my lover.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.791
But at the most important moment,

19:02.125 --> 19:03.958
he's such an idiot.

19:05.333 --> 19:06.666
Why are you telling me this?

19:08.666 --> 19:10.458
Because you didn't lie to me.

19:10.541 --> 19:12.333
So I don't want to lie to you.

19:13.666 --> 19:14.791
And…

19:15.750 --> 19:17.208
I was afraid you would mind.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.166
Why would I mind?

19:21.625 --> 19:22.750
If…

19:23.750 --> 19:26.291
If you like me even a little bit,

19:26.375 --> 19:27.583
you will mind.

19:36.666 --> 19:38.250
-Hey.
-Yes?

19:40.583 --> 19:42.166
So do you like me?

19:44.875 --> 19:46.208
I just broke up.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.625
I don't know.

19:53.541 --> 19:54.958
But I think

19:56.166 --> 19:57.708
I kind of like you.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.166
-It's so pretty!
<i>-Just like how I'd hoped,</i>

20:35.666 --> 20:37.166
<i>from that day onward,</i>

20:37.250 --> 20:38.791
<i>they started dating.</i>

20:40.833 --> 20:42.375
<i>In the eyes of others,</i>

20:42.458 --> 20:44.333
<i>it's like they were meant to be.</i>

20:44.916 --> 20:46.333
<i>-Like they were each other's destiny.</i>
-Your coffee.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.166
-Thank you.
-It's very hot.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.833
You can cook, do the dishes,

20:53.916 --> 20:54.833
and make coffee.

20:56.625 --> 20:58.083
What a good guy.

20:58.666 --> 21:00.000
Does that make me a good guy?

21:00.083 --> 21:01.833
If I say so.

21:02.541 --> 21:04.291
<i>-Cream looks happy.</i>
-How was tonight's dinner?

21:04.375 --> 21:05.875
<i>-Smiling every day.</i>
-It was delicious. Look.

21:05.958 --> 21:08.333
<i>She keeps pestering me with their stories.</i>

21:09.166 --> 21:12.583
<i>I think a "good man" is so good</i>

21:13.333 --> 21:15.416
<i>because he's capable of doing so much.</i>

21:16.333 --> 21:18.000
<i>He can do things that I can't.</i>

21:22.125 --> 21:24.000
Why do you keep telling me to get married?

21:25.375 --> 21:26.791
What?

21:27.625 --> 21:29.750
You told me to get married.

21:29.833 --> 21:31.750
Why do people have to get married?

21:32.333 --> 21:33.791
Because

21:33.875 --> 21:35.666
when you grow old,

21:35.750 --> 21:37.458
there'll be someone who can stay with you.

21:41.291 --> 21:43.500
Then aren't we married?

21:45.083 --> 21:46.125
Why?

21:46.208 --> 21:48.750
You've been with me since high school.

21:48.833 --> 21:51.083
Don't tell me
you'll leave me when I'm old.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.166
Stupid.

21:53.625 --> 21:54.625
That's different.

21:56.833 --> 21:58.625
You need a ceremony

21:58.708 --> 22:00.208
to be married, right?

22:05.791 --> 22:06.875
Really?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.125
How else?

22:13.875 --> 22:15.791
<i>I can never tell what Cream is thinking</i>

22:17.875 --> 22:19.333
<i>by looking from the side.</i>

22:22.208 --> 22:25.291
CHANG CHE-KAI, JUNE 15TH 2017, HENGCHUN

22:28.750 --> 22:30.166
CHANG CHE-KAI, AT PINGTUNG, KENTING

22:30.250 --> 22:33.833
KENTING DEEP SEA GUESTHOUSE

22:43.041 --> 22:44.708
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hello? Mr. Chi.

22:44.791 --> 22:45.916
It's me, Wang Po-han.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.416
<i>Bonnie is not home yet.
Stop rushing things.</i>

22:48.500 --> 22:49.625
No, I meant to ask you.

22:49.708 --> 22:51.416
That box of pineapples Bonnie sent you,

22:51.500 --> 22:52.833
where is it from?

22:52.916 --> 22:54.750
<i>From Kenting. Why?</i>

22:55.666 --> 22:57.250
By the way, you said

22:57.333 --> 22:59.375
that Bonnie and Cream
are close friends, right?

22:59.458 --> 23:00.666
<i>Yes.</i>

23:00.750 --> 23:03.458
<i>-You're asking about the copyright, right?</i>
-Yes, I am.

23:03.541 --> 23:05.583
I think Bonnie knows something.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.541
I'll just go there and look for her.

23:07.625 --> 23:09.083
<i>Hey…</i>

23:09.166 --> 23:12.125
<i>When you see her,
tell her that I'm willing to surrender.</i>

23:12.208 --> 23:13.500
<i>Tell her to come back, please.</i>

23:13.583 --> 23:14.833
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chi.

23:14.916 --> 23:16.625
I'll tell her if I see her.

23:16.708 --> 23:18.250
<i>-Please tell her.</i>
-Thank you. Bye.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.541
<i>Are you asleep, kid?</i>

23:36.625 --> 23:38.416
SEEN

23:38.500 --> 23:41.000
<i>Why? Do you want to play?</i>

23:41.083 --> 23:41.958
KE-LE

23:44.333 --> 23:47.083
<i>Playing at home is boring.
Let's go somewhere else.</i>

23:57.750 --> 23:58.875
Po-han.

23:59.375 --> 24:01.250
We came all this way just for a photo.

24:01.333 --> 24:02.750
Isn't that too reckless?

24:03.833 --> 24:05.708
We don't have much time.

24:05.791 --> 24:08.541
Any lead can be an opportunity.

24:10.416 --> 24:12.375
Thank you for thinking of Ke-le.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.208
Well…

24:20.291 --> 24:21.708
I think

24:21.791 --> 24:23.041
it was Bonnie

24:23.125 --> 24:25.291
who sent the demo.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.375
I don't know how she did it,

24:28.458 --> 24:31.750
but I think she has the copyright.

24:32.833 --> 24:34.416
But if it's owned by Bonnie,

24:34.500 --> 24:36.791
why didn't she give it to Mr. Chi?

24:36.875 --> 24:39.625
Why did they send such a great song
to our company?

24:39.708 --> 24:42.416
Do you think Catgirl can sing
such a sentimental song?

24:43.541 --> 24:45.791
Bonnie's style is quite unique.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.375
But they have other singers.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.875
An Yi-chi, I'm bored.

24:50.958 --> 24:51.958
Play with me.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.458
I'm talking to Mr. Wang about work.

24:54.541 --> 24:55.916
Hold on.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.583
You've been talking for so long.

24:58.666 --> 25:00.708
Play a word chain game with me then.

25:00.791 --> 25:01.916
Word chain?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.666
Didn't your mom ever tell you

25:03.750 --> 25:05.541
I won the best songwriter award?

25:05.625 --> 25:07.958
Stop talking. Opinionated.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.375
Distinguishing.

25:13.708 --> 25:14.666
G…

25:14.750 --> 25:16.875
Genuine.

25:16.958 --> 25:18.416
Enrich.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.458
Hasty.

25:23.041 --> 25:24.625
Are you insulting me?

25:26.291 --> 25:27.583
I…

25:27.666 --> 25:30.500
Impasse.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.083
<i>You have to start with "y."</i>

25:32.166 --> 25:33.833
<i>It's "hasty."</i>

25:33.916 --> 25:35.291
<i>"Hasty"? Is that a "y" or an "i"?</i>

25:35.375 --> 25:36.458
<i>-It's "i."</i>
<i>-It's "y."</i>

25:36.541 --> 25:39.458
<i>-It's "y."</i>
<i>-It's "y." Y…</i>

25:47.875 --> 25:49.750
Hurry up, An Yi-chi.

25:49.833 --> 25:51.958
Okay, you slow down.

25:53.041 --> 25:54.166
<i>Welcome.</i>

25:54.750 --> 25:55.875
Are you staying here?

25:55.958 --> 25:56.791
No.

25:56.875 --> 25:58.291
We're looking for Bonnie.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.791
Is this where she lives?

26:00.416 --> 26:01.500
Who are you?

26:02.333 --> 26:05.541
Don't worry.
We are from the record company.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.458
Our record company is called E Shine.

26:07.541 --> 26:09.625
Look. It's about business.

26:09.708 --> 26:11.166
We're not harassing her.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.458
I see.

26:12.541 --> 26:13.708
No wonder.

26:13.791 --> 26:15.250
He looks so handsome.

26:15.333 --> 26:17.125
I thought he was a celebrity.

26:18.750 --> 26:19.875
Where is she?

26:19.958 --> 26:22.291
She went up to the mountain to do yoga.

26:22.375 --> 26:23.750
Wait here.

26:23.833 --> 26:24.708
Yoga?

26:24.791 --> 26:26.583
-Yes.
-How long would that take?

26:26.666 --> 26:28.333
She's like a cat.

26:28.416 --> 26:30.791
She comes and goes
whenever she feels like it.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.083
Maybe one or two days.

26:32.166 --> 26:33.333
Or three to four days.

26:33.416 --> 26:35.166
Ma'am, could you come here for a moment?

26:35.250 --> 26:36.416
Excuse me.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.333
What should we do?

26:37.916 --> 26:39.625
Are we going to wait here?

26:40.125 --> 26:42.625
Or should we go up the mountain
and take a look?

26:42.708 --> 26:44.375
There are so many mountains here.
Where do we go?

26:57.041 --> 27:00.875
REGRET NEVER GOES FAR,
BUT HAPPINESS IS ALREADY GONE

27:02.291 --> 27:04.416
That's the lyrics to "The Saddest Thing."

27:05.333 --> 27:06.625
-Ma'am.
-Yes.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.958
Excuse me. Who wrote this?

27:09.041 --> 27:11.750
I think it was Bonnie's friend.

27:11.833 --> 27:14.583
Only she would write
things we don't understand.

27:15.291 --> 27:17.041
So, are you staying here?

27:17.125 --> 27:19.333
Yes, two rooms.

27:19.416 --> 27:20.458
Okay.

27:20.541 --> 27:23.208
Kid, how many days are you staying?
A week?

27:29.000 --> 27:31.791
The weather is so nice.

27:31.875 --> 27:32.708
That's right.

27:32.791 --> 27:36.250
It's so nice that I wonder
if we can see a meteor shower tonight.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.166
-What are you doing?
-I'm making a wish.

27:41.250 --> 27:42.541
Making a wish?

27:43.416 --> 27:45.250
There's no shooting star right now,
you idiot.

27:45.333 --> 27:48.333
That's why
I'm asking for a shooting star, idiot.

27:48.416 --> 27:49.333
Idiot.

27:50.041 --> 27:51.833
Ke-le is so smart. What wish did you make?

27:51.916 --> 27:53.000
Good health.

27:53.083 --> 27:54.208
Good health?

27:54.291 --> 27:55.500
Then I'll do it with you.

28:01.958 --> 28:04.416
Right. You mentioned "The Saddest Thing."

28:04.500 --> 28:05.500
What is it?

28:06.375 --> 28:08.708
It is a great love song.

28:08.791 --> 28:11.416
We're here to find the person
who wrote the song.

28:11.500 --> 28:12.333
Are we?

28:12.416 --> 28:14.375
Yes. Why would I lie to you?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.541
Then sing it to me.

28:18.916 --> 28:20.250
You play the guitar.

28:20.833 --> 28:21.875
There's no guitar.

28:22.375 --> 28:24.250
I think the owner has one.

28:24.333 --> 28:25.416
-I'll find it.
-Hey.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.125
An Ke-le.

28:31.708 --> 28:33.000
You play it.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.250
I don't want to.

28:42.500 --> 28:49.208
<i>You didn't take away all my longing</i>

28:49.291 --> 28:51.833
<i>Please return my apologies</i>

28:51.916 --> 28:55.375
<i>And hate me</i>

28:56.583 --> 28:59.083
<i>A complete story</i>

28:59.166 --> 29:03.083
<i>In an incomplete circle</i>

29:03.166 --> 29:05.208
<i>The saddest thing is</i>

29:05.291 --> 29:08.458
<i>I'm still at the beginning</i>

29:10.583 --> 29:12.833
<i>I am sick and tired</i>

29:12.916 --> 29:17.166
<i>-Of cheap vows
-Of cheap vows</i>

29:17.708 --> 29:20.416
<i>-Relying on your reliance
-Relying on your reliance</i>

29:20.500 --> 29:25.083
<i>Expecting your expectation</i>

29:25.166 --> 29:28.625
<i>Humble words</i>

29:28.708 --> 29:31.833
<i>In a pretended act</i>

29:32.416 --> 29:34.375
<i>The saddest thing is</i>

29:34.458 --> 29:38.083
<i>You don't owe me anything</i>

29:39.083 --> 29:41.541
<i>Don't look back</i>

29:41.625 --> 29:45.833
<i>Whenever you owe me again</i>

29:45.916 --> 29:48.125
<i>Day and night</i>

29:48.208 --> 29:50.500
<i>Near and far</i>

29:50.583 --> 29:54.375
<i>Feeling replaces feeling</i>

29:54.458 --> 29:57.916
<i>Regrets are never far</i>

29:58.000 --> 30:01.875
<i>But happiness</i>

30:02.750 --> 30:06.208
<i>Is already gone…</i>

30:09.208 --> 30:10.291
Thank you.

30:12.791 --> 30:14.083
Get some rest.

30:14.166 --> 30:15.958
Okay. Good night.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.041
Good night.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.333
An Yi-chi.

30:47.041 --> 30:48.458
Are you in love?

30:49.208 --> 30:50.458
Did you pretend to be asleep?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.583
Do you like Mr. Wang?

30:57.041 --> 30:58.666
No. Don't talk nonsense.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.333
But he doesn't seem to know yet.

31:06.541 --> 31:08.041
Don't talk nonsense.

31:08.916 --> 31:10.791
I'm not good enough for Mr. Wang.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.916
That's not a problem when you're in love.

31:19.791 --> 31:22.708
As long as you like each other.

31:29.375 --> 31:32.291
What do kids know about this? Stop it.

31:32.375 --> 31:33.625
Go to sleep.

31:41.291 --> 31:43.083
He's talking in his sleep.

32:22.791 --> 32:26.208
<i>That's not a problem when you're in love.</i>

32:29.375 --> 32:32.416
<i>As long as you like each other.</i>

32:37.208 --> 32:38.708
<i>What am I thinking about?</i>

32:38.791 --> 32:40.625
<i>Just go to sleep.</i>

32:50.833 --> 32:52.166
Po-han.

33:19.458 --> 33:22.125
Gosh. You're so heavy.

33:22.791 --> 33:24.208
Why are you here?

33:24.791 --> 33:26.583
There were too many mosquitoes in my room.

33:26.666 --> 33:27.958
That's why I'm here.

33:32.291 --> 33:33.500
What's so funny?

33:36.083 --> 33:37.666
Are you both awake?

33:39.166 --> 33:40.500
Good morning.

33:55.416 --> 33:58.250
Someone's really immature.

33:58.875 --> 34:00.125
Are you still in kindergarten?

34:00.208 --> 34:01.958
You're so childish.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.791
Just do Ke-le. Why me too?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.458
I didn't do anything.

34:06.041 --> 34:07.375
It has already happened.

34:07.458 --> 34:09.333
Stop thinking about it.

34:09.416 --> 34:10.791
What do you mean?

34:10.875 --> 34:12.500
Why didn't you draw on yourself?

34:13.875 --> 34:15.666
Your eyebrows don't look good.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.458
Your eyebrows are a mess.

34:17.541 --> 34:18.916
Who are you calling ugly?

34:19.000 --> 34:20.583
You look better this way.

34:20.666 --> 34:21.666
Like this.

34:23.583 --> 34:24.916
-Why are you laughing?
-Why are you laughing?

34:31.208 --> 34:32.375
Hurry up and eat.

34:33.041 --> 34:34.458
Bonnie is not back yet.

34:34.541 --> 34:35.916
Let's go somewhere first.

34:36.583 --> 34:37.500
Where?

34:38.875 --> 34:40.125
You'll see.

34:47.833 --> 34:48.916
Gosh!

34:53.916 --> 34:57.041
This must be the place in K's diary.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.791
So this is the upside-down world.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.416
An Yi-chi, let's go there.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Hurry up.

35:13.250 --> 35:14.541
An Ke-le!

35:14.625 --> 35:16.291
An Ke-le, come here!

35:25.500 --> 35:26.500
Take some pictures of us.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.083
Okay.

35:28.666 --> 35:29.666
Let's pose as superheroes.

35:29.750 --> 35:30.583
Okay.

35:30.666 --> 35:32.833
One, two, three.

35:33.666 --> 35:34.500
-One more.
-Okay.

35:34.583 --> 35:36.291
-Let's make a big heart shape.
-Okay.

35:37.166 --> 35:38.916
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.750
Join us.

35:44.833 --> 35:45.708
Okay.

35:47.666 --> 35:49.500
One, two, three.

35:50.791 --> 35:52.000
Make a funny face.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.375
He didn't make any faces.

35:58.458 --> 36:01.125
-He wasn't making faces. Get him!
-Get him!

36:25.208 --> 36:26.291
This one.

36:28.833 --> 36:29.750
GALLERY

36:29.833 --> 36:31.791
AN KE-LE, WANG PO-HAN, AND AN YI-CHI,
TO THE BEACH!

36:36.958 --> 36:38.041
Can I go there?

36:40.541 --> 36:41.625
Sure.

36:41.708 --> 36:43.000
Hold on.

36:43.083 --> 36:44.583
Be careful. Watch yourself.

36:45.166 --> 36:46.875
What do you do if you get too excited?

36:51.083 --> 36:52.541
An Yi-chi, good luck.

37:02.791 --> 37:03.833
Po-han.

37:05.541 --> 37:06.958
Thank you for taking us out.

37:09.166 --> 37:10.708
I told you it's just incidental.

37:10.791 --> 37:12.250
Stop thanking me.

37:18.833 --> 37:20.208
Over the years,

37:21.416 --> 37:23.666
I couldn't bring Ke-le out of Taipei.

37:25.541 --> 37:26.750
He used to tell me

37:26.833 --> 37:28.500
that his classmates went on trips.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.000
I knew he was jealous.

37:33.208 --> 37:35.208
But I just couldn't take him anywhere far.

37:37.625 --> 37:38.625
Later on,

37:39.416 --> 37:41.083
he stopped talking about it.

37:42.541 --> 37:44.458
I know he still wants to go on a trip,

37:45.041 --> 37:47.208
but he doesn't want me to blame myself.

37:51.041 --> 37:53.333
So this trip really means a lot to us.

38:00.333 --> 38:03.333
I wish Ke-le was a healthy boy.

38:03.416 --> 38:06.500
So he can run around and play.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.375
If possible,

38:08.875 --> 38:11.041
I want to take him to an amusement park.

38:11.125 --> 38:12.458
Or take him hiking.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.791
I want to take him to so many places.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.916
Show him how big the world is.

38:21.541 --> 38:22.666
Actually,

38:25.416 --> 38:28.000
the operation is next week.

38:31.375 --> 38:34.000
We don't know how the surgery will end.

38:35.625 --> 38:37.333
You have to trust him.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.083
He can make it.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.125
And…

38:41.208 --> 38:42.625
You love him so much.

38:42.708 --> 38:44.041
He knows it.

38:45.291 --> 38:47.083
He must know

38:47.166 --> 38:49.375
that you're the best mom in the world.

38:56.291 --> 38:59.541
Ke-le's surgery will be a success.

39:00.708 --> 39:02.708
Yes, it will be fine.

39:05.416 --> 39:06.916
A kid fainted.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.250
How did this happen?

39:08.333 --> 39:10.791
-We were playing sand when he fainted.
-Ke-le!

39:11.500 --> 39:12.625
Ke-le!

39:13.250 --> 39:14.583
-Ke-le!
-Someone please call 911!

39:14.666 --> 39:15.541
Excuse me.

39:15.625 --> 39:17.333
-Ke-le!
-I got it.

39:17.416 --> 39:18.666
Hello? 911?

39:18.750 --> 39:19.916
We're at Yanhailiao.

39:20.583 --> 39:23.125
A child with heart disease fainted.

39:23.208 --> 39:24.750
Yes, please hurry.

39:24.833 --> 39:25.875
Thank you.
