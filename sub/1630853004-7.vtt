WEBVTT

00:12.079 --> 00:13.381
- I finished my book.
- It's not good.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.515
We're circling
Claire Vanderbilt

00:14.548 --> 00:15.516
<i>for the summer push.</i>

00:15.549 --> 00:17.017
<i>Gaynor turned churchy.</i>

00:17.051 --> 00:19.286
<i>Jake is into some</i>
<i>nightmare gaming.</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:21.188
"Going to be in wine country.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.189
<i>Want to meet me?"</i>

00:22.223 --> 00:23.457
Think I need to go home.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.025
Unless you don't.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.128
- I'll build your fence.
- I thought you sold insurance.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.162
Suck a hot dick.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.330
Well, not anymore.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.198
Actually wearing that medal
she gave me.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.199
Oh, that's cool.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.034
They just offered me Thom's job.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.370
- When do we start?
- You want me to summon a demon?

00:36.404 --> 00:37.772
I need your help
to finish my book.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.240
I want to come inside you.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.574
You want to possess me?

00:41.475 --> 00:44.111
Fuck it.
Okay, Rosemary, come inside me.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.182
No!

01:54.148 --> 01:55.649
Rise and shine, everyone.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.118
It's time to go to the funeral.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.538
Valerie He
was a woman of faith.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.773
<i>- But like many of us...</i>
- I can't believe she's gone.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.308
<i>...she struggled</i>
<i>with her demons.</i>

02:21.342 --> 02:22.743
I know. It blows.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.144
<i>We must</i>
<i>acknowledge the many tragedies</i>

02:24.178 --> 02:25.513
<i>that afflicted her</i>
<i>in this life.</i>

02:25.546 --> 02:26.881
It doesn't blow. I'm an orphan.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.148
<i>Valerie lost</i>
<i>her husband, Henry...</i>

02:28.182 --> 02:29.283
How would you feel
if your mother

02:29.316 --> 02:31.352
jumped out of a window
onto a fence?

02:31.385 --> 02:34.355
<i>...eight years</i>
<i>ago in a freak accident.</i>

02:34.388 --> 02:35.623
Yeah, it's complicated.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.824
<i>They were loving...</i>

02:36.857 --> 02:39.493
Can't help but feel like

02:39.527 --> 02:41.462
if I had somehow
made a worse fence,

02:41.495 --> 02:42.863
she'd still be here.

02:42.897 --> 02:45.165
Oh, don't blame yourself.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.400
<i>...a shock for Valerie.</i>

02:46.433 --> 02:49.803
When a woman wants to die,
she'll find a way.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.272
<i>Henry stuck his head</i>

02:51.305 --> 02:52.773
<i>out of a moving</i>
<i>school bus window</i>

02:52.806 --> 02:55.476
<i>- and was decapitated...</i>
- Hey, buddy. Hi.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.911
So sad, huh?

02:56.944 --> 02:58.379
How'd you know Valerie?

02:58.412 --> 03:00.180
- We went out twice.
- Oh.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.649
<i>Her father was</i>
<i>killed by a pack of dogs...</i>

03:01.682 --> 03:03.617
Actually, tonight was supposed
to be the third date.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.919
<i>They were rottweilers.</i>

03:04.952 --> 03:07.388
That's the date where
you're supposed to get sex.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.723
Laird, a woman just died.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.458
Maybe you wait till her body's
in the ground

03:11.492 --> 03:13.794
before talking
about fucking her.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.329
- Amen.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.630
Let's go.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.968
<i>- Jake!</i>
- Just a minute!

03:21.201 --> 03:22.636
Her name is Daisy.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.506
I thought she was an NPC,
but then she led me to this.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.578
Dude, check it out.
I bet she was murdered.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.314
Bro, I bet she wants us
to find her murderer.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.584
- Bro.
- Dude.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.786
Jake, now!

04:47.354 --> 04:49.857
- Good morning.
- Correction, great morning.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.558
I love these suits
you picked out for me.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.726
How do I look?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.595
Like a hundred dollars.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.864
Oh, I hope I didn't make
this collar too stiff.

04:56.897 --> 05:00.300
- Mm, I like them stiff.
- I bet you do.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.435
Ew, when are old people

05:01.468 --> 05:03.437
finally disgusted
by each other?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.439
Let you know when we get old.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.774
Why is my bag warm?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.376
I made you fresh peach cobbler.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.913
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.749
Aren't you
forgetting something?

05:15.783 --> 05:18.686
Give your mother a kiss.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.689
Jacob, eyes on me.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.393
I'm going with Ryan.
I'll see ya.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.663
Oh, Gaynor, I put some money
in your purse for lunch.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.731
You went through my purse?

05:30.764 --> 05:32.366
I told you
not to touch my shit.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.934
Jesus fuck, Gaynor.
I gave you free money.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.402
Just say fucking thank you.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.771
Fine,
I'll take your fucking money.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.506
Nice outfit.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.944
Pat, you okay?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.480
Oh, yeah. I just...

05:46.513 --> 05:48.115
- Well, you know Gaynor.
- Oh.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.018
Oh, I'ma be late
for my first day back at work.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.453
- Mm.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.557
Your cobbler.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.561
Who is this lady?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.773
Terry, I want to throw a party.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.541
What? You hate parties?

06:14.575 --> 06:15.709
We haven't had a housewarming.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.578
I want to show off the house.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.679
You hate the house.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.647
I just needed time
to get used to it.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.049
We can invite
all of our new friends.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.517
You don't have any new friends.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.618
Jesus fuck, Terry.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.019
I just want to have
a cocktail party.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.123
I'm not asking to land
the Mars Rover.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.958
Okay, okay, I'm just not sure
throwing a party

06:30.991 --> 06:33.827
is such a great idea
for a former party girl.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.729
They write books
about that sort of thing.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.531
You literally
wrote a book about that.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.400
And now I'm writing a book
about a '50s housewife.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.870
Fifties housewife
who smokes a lot.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.873
She also likes to cook
and clean and make love.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.508
Are you not on board with that?

06:47.541 --> 06:50.144
Oh, I am fully on board
with that.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.478
Let's celebrate.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.746
All right, who do you
want to invite?

06:52.780 --> 06:56.116
Well, you can invite Laird,
and I'll invite Kam.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.551
Okay.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.852
- Table for four, huh?

07:00.521 --> 07:01.555
Invite Kathryn.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.658
I'd like to meet her.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.426
I don't want to mix business
with pleasure.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.761
She's your partner.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.129
I'd like to know who she is.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.064
This feels a little,
you know, weird.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.901
It's only weird
if you make it weird.

07:16.737 --> 07:20.174
- Y-your, uh, bosoms.
- Fresh.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.109
<i>Here, we can drop</i>
<i>all your mom's stuff in here.</i>

07:22.142 --> 07:24.111
What's in these boxes anyway?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.813
Oh, it's just some stuff
about the town

07:25.846 --> 07:27.447
but mostly articles
and research

07:27.481 --> 07:28.882
my mom collected
about your house.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.184
Yeah, no offense,
but your mom

07:30.217 --> 07:31.785
was a bit of a creeper.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.588
Well, she was obsessed
with your house.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.925
Even when it was empty,
she always sensed...

07:37.958 --> 07:39.193
a presence.

07:41.195 --> 07:42.629
- Oh, fuck.
- Gosh.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.600
Jake?

07:46.633 --> 07:49.670
Sorry, I was doing something,
and then I heard

07:49.703 --> 07:51.004
<i>- you guys come in.</i>
- Perv.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.874
No-no, there's a hole
in the back of this skull.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.176
- Ah, perv!
- No!

07:56.210 --> 07:58.879
I found this old skull,
and there's a hole in it,

07:58.912 --> 08:00.647
and I'm trying
to find the murder weapon.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.116
So fucking creepy. Go, go.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.154
Sorry, I know I curse a lot.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.555
Oh, I kinda don't even
hear it anymore.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.692
I was actually looking
at your necklace.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.927
The one my mom gave you.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.195
Do you want it back?

08:15.229 --> 08:16.864
No, she'd want you
to keep it.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.899
My mom always wore hers
for protection,

08:18.932 --> 08:21.935
but she wasn't wearing it
when she died.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.104
They never found it.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.206
I can't believe she's gone.

08:31.812 --> 08:35.649
Mm, ah, sorry,
I have terrible instincts.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.818
Get that from my mother along
with my flass and cursing.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.120
Fuck, um...

08:40.153 --> 08:42.856
could you please
say something now?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.603
<i>We did it.</i>

08:56.637 --> 08:57.704
I mean, this is better
than <i>Cressida.</i>

08:57.738 --> 08:59.072
We did it?

08:59.106 --> 09:01.008
You have no fucking idea

09:01.041 --> 09:02.743
what I had to do
to bring Rosemary back.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.810
Okay, who cares?

09:03.844 --> 09:05.646
I can't wait to see
how it ends.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.947
And yeah, I'ma take
a little credit,

09:06.980 --> 09:08.248
because I motivated you.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.117
What, so that was all a lie

09:10.150 --> 09:11.885
about me not getting
the summer release

09:11.919 --> 09:14.321
and giving it to that twatkin
Claire Vanderbilt?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.056
No, no, no, no, no, no,
that was true.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.557
Don't be mad.

09:17.591 --> 09:18.692
You and I both know

09:18.725 --> 09:20.060
that sometimes you need
some tough love.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.161
- Mm.
<i>- All right, there you are.</i>

09:21.194 --> 09:22.229
Thank you. Do you think
I can get an extra dressing?

09:41.949 --> 09:43.283
What the hell happened?

09:43.317 --> 09:45.252
Oh, I told Kam

09:45.285 --> 09:48.689
we needed $250,000 or we walk.

09:48.722 --> 09:52.025
- What did she say?
- She said no. So we walked.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.827
It's one thing
to fuck my husband.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.362
<i>It's another</i>
<i>to fuck my career.</i>

09:55.595 --> 09:56.363
We're just playing ball.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.031
I'm supposed to be in charge.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.200
Well, you are
until you need help,

10:00.233 --> 10:02.102
and then I take over.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.071
And why did we buy this car?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.639
Oh, that's on me.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.874
Rolf never let me
use the good car.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.978
Fuck, Rosemary,
just help me write my book.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.313
Stop buying cars,
and stop smoking.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.115
<i>It's unhealthy.</i>

10:15.148 --> 10:16.116
Says who?

10:16.149 --> 10:18.018
Okay, I'm late for therapy.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.620
Oh, we canceled
because we're doing great.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.122
No, no,
we're not--we're not "we."

10:22.155 --> 10:24.157
It's "me." I'm doing great.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.326
- Put your seat belt on.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.161
Crazy fucking lady.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.876
- Daisy?
- Who's Daisy?

10:42.909 --> 10:43.910
Oh.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.248
Gaynor, come zip Mother up.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.649
Daughter doesn't want to.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.351
Oh, for once,
can you do something for me

10:51.385 --> 10:52.986
<i>without giving me lip?</i>

10:59.026 --> 11:01.294
Thank you. Join me for a drink?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.330
You know I'm 16, right?

11:03.363 --> 11:04.998
Well, that didn't stop you
from sleeping

11:05.032 --> 11:06.333
with the virgin orphan.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.968
You don't know
what you're talking about.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.236
Who told you?

11:09.269 --> 11:11.171
Mothers can sense these things.

11:12.305 --> 11:16.877
So what are you gonna do now?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.012
I don't know.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.050
What do you care? You don't
want me dating him anyway.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.284
You win.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.421
Life is way too short

11:27.454 --> 11:30.257
to spend so much energy
hating your mother.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.025
I don't hate you.

11:32.059 --> 11:35.028
I just... don't want to be you.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.264
Oh, well, congratulations.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.965
That makes you
a normal daughter.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.467
Look, I'm just--
I'm trying not to be

11:40.700 --> 11:42.436
such a shitty person
right now, okay?

11:42.469 --> 11:44.471
And I thought being baptized
would help.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.973
And then I sleep with a virgin.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.109
What the fuck is wrong with me?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.711
What is wrong
is that you're 16 years old

11:51.745 --> 11:53.380
and you think
that every decision you make

11:53.413 --> 11:55.315
is the end of the world.

11:55.348 --> 11:58.051
It's just not. Trust me.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.453
Come here.

12:02.456 --> 12:03.857
I just--

12:07.094 --> 12:09.062
I just--

12:09.096 --> 12:11.765
I feel like I can't
fucking win.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.502
Well, that is called

12:15.735 --> 12:18.071
being a woman.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.372
What are you doing?

12:20.874 --> 12:23.510
I'm touching you.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.246
I love you. Come here.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.119
Come here.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.189
It's gonna be okay.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.409
Kathryn, welcome
to "Connec-ticut."

12:56.443 --> 12:59.146
Are you kidding me
with this house?

12:59.179 --> 13:02.315
How much more money
do you make than me?

13:02.349 --> 13:05.852
Uh, national average
is about 30%.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.155
But I actually got it
way below asking.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.358
Wow, you look--

13:14.794 --> 13:15.962
- Hey.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.265
Sorry about that.
I was wrapping up a work call.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.799
You must be Terry.

13:19.833 --> 13:23.003
Yes, yes. Uh, you are?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.804
Blake, my husband.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.940
Oh, Blake. The husband.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.875
Yes, wow.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.243
Okay, got it.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.578
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.346
My wife loves you.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.416
And I love... to hear that.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.352
Hey, you make her so happy,

13:39.386 --> 13:40.420
and I should know.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.355
I'm quite literally an expert.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.358
Blake is a chief
happiness officer.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.260
- Oh.
- Companies hire me

13:47.294 --> 13:49.930
to help employees
find their inner smile.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.598
- Ah.
- You know what the secret is?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.067
No.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.403
You start with an outer smile,

13:56.436 --> 13:58.305
and if that doesn't work,

13:58.338 --> 14:00.173
you give yourself a smile snap.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.177
- Every time.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.547
Well, it's good to be married
to somebody who's happy.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.883
<i>Aren't you going</i>
<i>to introduce me?</i>

14:26.533 --> 14:29.202
Kathryn, this is, uh...

14:32.906 --> 14:36.409
Patricia... the wife.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.214
Yes, obviously
I know your name.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.351
I--Kathryn, this is Pat.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.920
Pat, Kat. Kat, Pat.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.054
Pat, Kat.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.222
I've heard so much
about you, Kathryn.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.358
And I have heard
so much about you.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.160
Y-you look fantastic.

14:54.194 --> 14:57.330
Pat is actually researching
a character for her book, so...

14:57.364 --> 14:58.932
- Isn't that fun?
- Very cool.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.533
And who is this?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.402
Blake. I make people happy.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.371
I bet you do.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.378
- Who wants a tour?
- Oh, that-that sounds great.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.512
Okay.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.615
<i>And here we go!</i>

15:15.649 --> 15:18.618
<i>Right this way.</i>

15:18.652 --> 15:21.187
Holy shit, this house.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.255
I mean, no wonder
you're writing

15:22.289 --> 15:24.557
such a weird fucking book.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.159
Mrs. Phelps, can I just say,

15:26.192 --> 15:28.628
I am, like,
your number one fan.

15:28.662 --> 15:30.497
Well, call me Patricia.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.465
Okay, Patricia.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.667
I'm Claire Vanderbilt.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.970
What?

15:37.003 --> 15:40.307
Uh, you're the reason
I became a writer.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.608
God damn it.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.944
I was obsessed
with <i>Cressida Unbound.</i>

15:44.978 --> 15:47.447
I even got in trouble for
bringing it to middle school.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.686
That is a great fucking story,
Claire.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.120
Can I talk to you for a second?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.288
Course.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.190
This looks like the <i>Titanic.</i>

15:57.223 --> 15:59.192
Why the fuck
did you invite her?

15:59.225 --> 16:01.061
Because you asked me to.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.729
Obviously I was joking.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.432
Do you know how humiliating
it is to have someone here

16:05.465 --> 16:07.033
who's ten years younger
than you

16:07.067 --> 16:08.702
making ten times more than you?

16:08.735 --> 16:10.970
Okay, both of those numbers
are way off.

16:11.004 --> 16:14.507
Listen, after our lunch, I went
and spoke with my publisher

16:14.541 --> 16:15.675
and told her
that you might need

16:15.709 --> 16:18.044
a little bit more
of an advance, so...

16:19.612 --> 16:21.981
Stop her. Don't let her do it.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.249
Stop her.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.018
What the fuck are you saying?

16:25.051 --> 16:28.555
I'm saying I got you $100,000.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.125
- Oh, my God.
- But my job is on the line,

16:32.158 --> 16:33.626
so don't fuck me on this.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.399
- I won't. I promise. Oh, my--

16:39.432 --> 16:41.434
- I love you.
- I love you too.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.103
Come on, let's go celebrate,
mm?

16:46.573 --> 16:49.142
Claire, let me take your coat,

16:49.175 --> 16:50.310
and I'll get you a drink.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.478
You're old enough to drink,
aren't you?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.380
Oh, I'm 27.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.614
Amazing.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.449
Why did you invite her?

16:56.483 --> 16:58.051
Well, I thought
it was important

16:58.084 --> 16:59.219
that we know the competition.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.488
Claire's not my competition.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.090
- She's already won.
- <i>Not Claire, silly.</i>

17:04.124 --> 17:05.692
I invited Claire for fun.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.794
I'm talking about Kathryn.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.596
You've seen the way
that Terry looks at her.

17:09.629 --> 17:13.066
It's the same way that Rolf
looked at his secretary.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.101
Kathryn is not his secretary,

17:15.135 --> 17:17.270
and Terry
is completely faithful.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.671
Really?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.807
He's such an animal in bed.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.109
I really like that one
where you're on top.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.244
Okay, stop it.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.212
And stop having
so much sex with him.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.081
It's-it's giving me a UTI.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.750
Okay, well,
what about that Blake fellow?

17:30.784 --> 17:32.385
I wouldn't mind
taking him home.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.522
You would be taking him
to my home and using my body.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.756
So that's a hard no.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.324
Oh, come on.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.126
Take your medicine.
You're no fun.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.430
No, I've already taken twice
the recommended dosage today.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.831
And it's not working.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.633
Every time you get annoyed,

17:46.666 --> 17:48.802
your horrible personality
pokes out.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.236
It's not horrible.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.638
I just don't like
throwing parties.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.406
When are you going to trust me?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.341
I've restarted your career.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.610
I got eye contact from Jacob.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.213
I even got a hug from the girl.

18:02.215 --> 18:05.185
I am making you
into your best self.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.754
Look, take the pills,

18:07.787 --> 18:09.689
<i>stop resisting,</i>

18:09.722 --> 18:12.459
and let someone else
do the work for once.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.330
Fine.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.709
Laird, you're wearing a kilt.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.511
It is a party.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.714
Do you think
it's a bit too much?

18:34.747 --> 18:37.484
I think it's not enough.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.485
Get inside here.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.286
Hey.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.322
- Wow. Looks good.
- Yeah, yeah, well, we--

18:45.158 --> 18:47.527
Fred! Dad, can Fred stay over?

18:47.560 --> 18:48.728
Thanks. We're gonna sleep
in the tree house.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.597
Come on.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.332
All right, be good.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.800
- Everybody...

18:53.833 --> 18:55.401
...this is Laird.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.503
Laird, the party.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.670
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.906
- Hi. How you doing?
- Hi.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.307
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it's good--

19:03.243 --> 19:04.477
- Is this it?
- <i>Mm.</i>

19:04.511 --> 19:05.645
Really?

19:07.447 --> 19:09.315
Okay, everybody, hi.
Sorry about that.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.885
Uh, here's the deal.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.854
This is my first night out
since my girlfriend died.

19:17.323 --> 19:20.426
Um, I'm fine.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.562
I'm sorry.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.265
It's just that I really need
to have a good time tonight.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.536
Oh.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.305
Also, I brought cocaine.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.773
I am loving this guy
in the kilt.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.576
Thank you. I like your suit.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.444
<i>Are you ready?</i>

19:38.478 --> 19:39.779
I was born ready.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.347
Are you nervous?

19:41.381 --> 19:42.682
I was born nervous.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.587
Is there someone here with us?

19:52.759 --> 19:55.361
Is this your skull?

19:59.933 --> 20:01.301
What's your name?

20:04.337 --> 20:06.205
D...

20:06.239 --> 20:07.206
<i>A...</i>

20:14.514 --> 20:15.582
<i>...N.</i>

20:15.615 --> 20:18.318
I thought you said
this was Daisy.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.852
It must be a typo.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.690
I know it feels like
the end of the world,

20:23.723 --> 20:26.359
but it's only because we're 16.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.761
My mom committed suicide.
Then you took my virginity.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.997
Now I'm having
a crisis of faith.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.733
What does that have to do
with being 16?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.768
Um...

20:35.802 --> 20:37.570
you know, it made sense
when I heard it.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.571
Look, if you didn't want
to be with me,

20:38.605 --> 20:39.739
why didn't you just ghost me?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.641
Because I didn't want to be
a shitty person.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.810
Really? Because you're the
shittiest person I've ever met.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.447
I'm not even the shittiest
person in my house.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.983
My idea of heaven
is a solid white nightclub

20:50.016 --> 20:52.485
with me as the headliner
for all eternity.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.820
And they love me.

21:16.643 --> 21:20.313
I was just up in the attic.

21:20.346 --> 21:21.614
You're gonna die up there.

21:28.888 --> 21:29.889
Oh, shit.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.963
I'm so sorry I peed your floor.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.631
Please have me back.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.300
He'll be fine.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.702
- I think he just...

21:42.735 --> 21:44.671
...had a bad reaction
to cocaine

21:44.704 --> 21:47.340
probably because...
it's cocaine.

21:47.373 --> 21:49.008
Great, weird party.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.744
Try and put the guy pissing
himself on coke in the book.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.312
I'll see what I can do.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.580
I can't find my other glove.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.015
Oh, I'll buy you some more.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.483
Let's get the fuck
out of Connecticut.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.851
- It really freaks me out.
- Bye.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.688
Blake and I
are gonna get going too.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.490
We usually try and leave
before the ambulance arrives.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.792
Such a great party.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.360
Oh, you can't leave.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.862
<i>We haven't had a chance</i>
<i>to get to know each other.</i>

22:09.896 --> 22:11.631
Come on, just stay
for one drink.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.932
One teeny martini.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.669
I insist.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.640
All right, all right, my turn.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.875
Are you one of those?

22:22.909 --> 22:25.378
I don't know
what one of those are,

22:25.411 --> 22:26.646
but I certainly am one.

22:28.715 --> 22:29.882
What a great game.
Where'd you get it?

22:29.916 --> 22:31.984
Pat found it behind the bar.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.387
Holy shit, how is it--
It's 3:30 already.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.688
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, we should go.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.523
I-I have an early morning
at Google.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.991
Thank you both so much.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.860
Just one more question.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.895
We have to complete the circle,
or it's bad luck.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.397
Okay, last one,

22:44.430 --> 22:46.933
'cause I really have had to pee
for, like, an hour.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.836
Ooh, this is a good one.

22:49.869 --> 22:53.406
Have you ever
almost had an affair

22:53.439 --> 22:55.007
with someone you work with?

22:59.011 --> 23:01.447
That's a--
What kinda question is that?

23:02.548 --> 23:05.384
An impertinent one.

23:05.418 --> 23:08.521
Have you ever
almost had an affair

23:08.554 --> 23:10.990
with someone you work with?

23:14.827 --> 23:17.029
You know what?
Um, babe, we really should go.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.700
What's going on, babe?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.034
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

23:22.068 --> 23:24.604
Does Blake not know about
the two of you at the winery?

23:24.637 --> 23:26.506
Oh, Jesus Christ. Um...

23:26.539 --> 23:28.040
What winery?

23:28.074 --> 23:29.909
Pat, what are you doing?

23:29.942 --> 23:31.144
<i>Not our winery.</i>

23:32.512 --> 23:35.481
Terry and I had...

23:35.515 --> 23:39.085
a drink at, um, a winery.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.422
Yes, the winery
where we got married,

23:43.456 --> 23:45.024
but nothing happened.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.093
Not the table
under the oak tree.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.999
Oh, my God.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.100
Why would you do that?

23:54.133 --> 23:56.502
I--you know what?
I had too much to drink.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.570
Yeah, you always have
too much to drink.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.038
And you do drugs.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.206
Yeah, well,
you're my mom's age.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.909
Wow, okay.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.546
I hate this. Ugh!

24:08.748 --> 24:11.017
I fucking hate this!

24:11.050 --> 24:12.919
You're...

24:12.952 --> 24:14.187
evil.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.026
I was just playing the game.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.509
- Damn it.
- Dude, give it up.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.044
Also, can I have
this picture of your mom?

24:38.077 --> 24:41.514
Bro, no.
I-I know her name is Daisy.

24:41.547 --> 24:42.949
Who the hell is Dan?

24:57.730 --> 25:00.533
Kathryn, I thought you left.

25:00.566 --> 25:03.970
Uh, I was looking for Blake,
and now I just want to go home.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.538
Can we--

25:05.571 --> 25:08.708
Well, the train stopped running
at, uh, midnight,

25:08.741 --> 25:11.944
and the nearest Uber
is Brooklyn.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.613
What am I supposed to do?

25:15.081 --> 25:17.683
Ah, here we go.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.518
Welcome to the Phelps Carlton.

25:19.552 --> 25:21.587
I feel like we should have
a company policy

25:21.621 --> 25:23.155
on sleepovers starting Monday.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.225
I'm so sorry, Kathryn.

25:26.259 --> 25:27.860
I--

25:27.894 --> 25:30.630
I wish I could say
I can't believe

25:30.663 --> 25:33.165
this happened, but...

25:33.199 --> 25:34.667
I can.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.638
You know what? Um...

25:41.274 --> 25:43.709
...this was
a really shitty party.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.177
- Yeah.

25:45.211 --> 25:49.815
- This was the worst party...

25:49.849 --> 25:52.718
...that has ever happened
on the planet.

25:55.655 --> 25:59.025
What just happened?

26:30.656 --> 26:34.327
"Thanks for giving me back
my smile."

26:35.194 --> 26:36.729
What?

26:41.867 --> 26:43.636
Oh, no.

26:43.669 --> 26:44.670
Oh, no.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.344
No, no, no.

26:51.377 --> 26:54.380
What did you do?

26:58.951 --> 27:00.086
Fuck!

27:00.119 --> 27:01.921
Let me show you.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.323
What? Show me what, Valerie He?

27:09.996 --> 27:11.630
Mom, you give
really shitty advice.

27:11.664 --> 27:12.999
No fucking kidding.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.767
His name is Dan.
He went missing in the 1950s.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.768
Jake, honey, I'm just--

27:15.801 --> 27:16.936
I'm having a really bad
morning.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.904
- Pat, hey.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.040
Listen, last night, things
really got outta control.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.175
Terry, I love you.
Not fucking right now.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.245
I did something very bad.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.380
Join the club.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.057
What?

27:44.296 --> 27:46.065
Did you kill Valerie He?

27:47.299 --> 27:50.236
Did I, or did we?

27:50.269 --> 27:52.371
You are out of control.

27:52.405 --> 27:54.740
No, Patricia.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.876
I'm in complete control.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.011
I'm not afraid of you.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.013
I've been through hell.

28:01.047 --> 28:04.083
If you hurt me or my family,
I will fucking--

28:06.752 --> 28:08.287
Oh, shit.
