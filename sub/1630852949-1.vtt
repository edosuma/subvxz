Hey, why I always got
to get the broken ones?

MAN:
Try the trigger.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.859
KYRA:
Father, I'm fighting this time.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.661
Father!

02:07.695 --> 02:09.229
Go back in your room,
Kyra.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.200
Get back in your room!

02:12.233 --> 02:14.768

02:51.505 --> 02:52.906

Oh!

04:55.596 --> 04:58.466
Maker of all that
is pure and good.

04:58.499 --> 05:02.503
We release this girl from
the evil that possesses her.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.504
PENDRA: Ugh!
ALL: Kill the beast.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.673
Kill the beast.
PENDRA: You don't understand!

05:05.706 --> 05:09.810
Kill the beast.
Kill the beast.

05:09.843 --> 05:14.114
Kill the beast.
Kill the beast.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.060
( horse neighing )

05:35.403 --> 05:37.471
Cut her loose.

05:37.505 --> 05:41.709
She's from the outpost.
The place is infested with evil.

05:41.742 --> 05:42.843
( Pendra whimpering )

05:42.876 --> 05:44.745
No one gets away
from there and lives.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.083
I said, cut her loose.

05:51.752 --> 05:55.088
This conversation is over.
Now move on.

SOLDIER 3:
Kill him!

( groans )

06:52.045 --> 06:54.081
( horse neighs )

06:54.114 --> 06:56.116
Go.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.051
Hyah!

06:59.520 --> 07:01.154
Hyah!

Enough, enough!

08:52.933 --> 08:54.301
( Pendra whimpers )

08:54.334 --> 08:56.904
( grunts )

08:56.937 --> 08:58.271
Just kidding.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.272
( sighs )

09:01.308 --> 09:03.811
Take her and go.

09:03.844 --> 09:07.147
Thank you.
But I'm not going that way.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.056
You're a dead man already.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.692
Let's go.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.329
PENDRA:
How many are dead?

09:22.362 --> 09:24.732
I don't want to die.

09:29.837 --> 09:34.007
It comes and kills.
Killing everybody.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.375
It's gonna kill you.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.144
BEOWULF:
Why did you run?

09:37.177 --> 09:41.314
It's there.
It's in there.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.785
It? What is it?
Every night.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.688
He comes home every night.
Every night.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.256
It's killing everyone.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.297
ROLAND:
What's up?

09:57.330 --> 10:02.002
It's Pendra. She's alive.
Yeah, but who's that with her?

10:02.035 --> 10:04.805
And how the hell
did they get through?

10:04.838 --> 10:08.709
WILL:
If they let him and her through,
well, maybe it's over.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.846
( dramatic theme playing )

10:17.117 --> 10:19.853
Oh, God.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.757
How many people
are left inside?

10:27.194 --> 10:29.196
How many...?
PENDRA: Aah!

10:29.229 --> 10:31.198
( gasping )

10:35.202 --> 10:36.436
No!

10:36.469 --> 10:38.405
( all cheering )

10:40.373 --> 10:41.108
BEOWULF:
Hyah!

10:43.276 --> 10:45.412
Well,
there's your answer, kid.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.380
She should've stayed.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.850
WILL:
At least for her,
it's over.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.953
( horse neighs )

10:56.489 --> 10:57.991
Who are you
and what do you want?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.995
I'm Beowulf
and I need some food and rest.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.164
He's one of them.

11:04.197 --> 11:07.434
How else could he
have gotten through?

11:07.467 --> 11:10.037
Go on back
to your friends.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.839
I'm not one of them.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.041
And you're not
one of us.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.177
No, but by the looks
of things

11:17.210 --> 11:20.147
you would think an additional
sword would be welcome.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.349
If he's good enough
to get through the siege scum,

11:22.382 --> 11:24.752
the Border Lord
should talk to him.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.419
We can always
kill him later.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.858
It's for Hrothgar
to decide.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.329
You may enter with no guarantee
of safe passage.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.032
I'll take the chance.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.801
( suspenseful theme playing )

11:43.971 --> 11:45.906
( horse neighing )

12:06.559 --> 12:08.295
( man speaks indistinctly
over speaker )

12:11.865 --> 12:13.366
MAN:
Guards, be on alert.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.973
Gate closed.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.475
Gate secured.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.382
Follow me.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.630
Beowulf.
I've heard that name before.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.032
Oh, yeah,
what do you hear?

13:52.065 --> 13:54.234
Stories only idiots
would believe.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.503
KARL:
Only an idiot would come
to this damned place.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.106
Heh, heh, heh.
Unless he was already damned.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.522
A mercenary.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.260
It's not something we've come
to expect around here.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.398
How did you get through
the siege lines?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.600
On my horse.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.405
You just asked them nicely?

14:32.439 --> 14:35.375
Something like that.

14:35.408 --> 14:39.012
Do you think that
we've got buried gold here?

14:39.046 --> 14:41.014
Or are you just a lover
of drafty old outposts?

14:41.048 --> 14:42.983
Neither.

14:45.018 --> 14:49.957
HROTHGAR: Then what brings you?
The darkness.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.463
You know
about our problem?

14:58.966 --> 15:01.434
And what?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.270
You're offering
to help?

15:05.505 --> 15:07.207
Yes.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.517
No sane man would come here
to face this thing.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.287
I have no choice.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.990
You make it sound personal.
ROLAND: Border Lord.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.325
We don't know anything
about this man. Send him back.

15:25.358 --> 15:30.330
Roland, we have less
than 40 men left.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.300
And as you noted,
night comes quickly.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.505
Give him Nivri's room.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.345
ROLAND:
Will.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.985
Nivri's room.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.264
ROLAND:
He's dangerous.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.699
Definitely.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.636
Until now at least we could
trust our guys on the inside.

16:09.669 --> 16:13.373
He's not from
the siege lines.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.742
No man whose been
sitting out there

16:15.775 --> 16:17.744
night after night knowing
what's happening here

16:17.777 --> 16:21.414
would willingly come
to this place.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.583
Something else.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.118
He may have been sent
by Nivri's family.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.256
Revenge for
your son-in-law's death.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.990
They lost their only son.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.296
If they believe his death
was no accident,

16:36.329 --> 16:38.798
they would want retaliation.

16:38.831 --> 16:43.002
Whoever he is, let's see
how he feels in the morning.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.573
He'll either be
on his horse out of here

16:46.606 --> 16:48.441
or getting an inside look
at our crematorium.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.645
Either way,

16:52.679 --> 16:53.680
problem solved.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.155
Yeah, and the weapons master,
well, that's my uncle.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.757
That's why I am
the assistant weapons master.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.626
You know, not because
I'm any good at it.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.194
And once I get
out of here, man,

17:08.228 --> 17:09.529
I'm heading East
towards the water.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.397
Do you think
you'll get out?

17:11.431 --> 17:13.165
Well, you see
that girl Pendra,

17:13.200 --> 17:14.601
she and I were supposed
to go together.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.704
As you can see, things
didn't work out so good, huh?

17:17.737 --> 17:20.573
So, I'm still here. Why, do you
think we'll get out?

17:20.607 --> 17:22.608
Probably not.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.250
Well, this is it.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.554
Who is Nivri?

17:34.587 --> 17:36.589
Well, Nivri was
the Border Lord's son-in-law.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.658
He was married to Kyra.
Was?

17:38.691 --> 17:40.827
Yeah, killed.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.368
What's this?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.670
I wouldn't touch that.
The beast got him?

17:50.703 --> 17:52.705
Oh, no, no,
before the beast.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.876
( panting )

17:56.909 --> 17:59.312
Assistant
weapons master?

17:59.346 --> 18:02.549
Yeah, ironic, huh?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.553
How did he die?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.288
( doors open )
Well...

18:13.393 --> 18:14.727
( doors close )

18:21.868 --> 18:24.604
A guest.
How unlikely.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.444
My husband used to come here
when he drank.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.449
I haven't been here
since he died.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.418
My condolences.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.819
I know the reason
you're here.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.690
His family sent you,
didn't they?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.725
Nobody sent me.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.929
What do they want
from us?

18:49.962 --> 18:54.234
Titles?
His share of the land?

18:54.267 --> 18:58.238
Will that satisfy them?
I'm not who you think I am.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.707
His death
was an accident.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.343
At weapons practice
with Roland.

19:03.376 --> 19:07.214
Weapons practice
can be so dangerous.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.886
You claim to be here
to fight our beast.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.224
It's not a claim.
It's the truth.

19:17.257 --> 19:20.493
Well, it can't
be killed.

19:20.527 --> 19:23.896
Not by my father
or Roland

19:23.930 --> 19:25.565
or any man.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.401
I'm not like other men.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.773
That you'll have to prove.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.352
ROLAND:
What's going to happen
when the beast comes?

19:45.385 --> 19:46.919
( suspenseful theme playing )

19:55.528 --> 19:57.264
( breathes in
then breathes out )

20:00.333 --> 20:03.336
Doesn't matter
if you're tired.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.972
You can sleep
when you're dead.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.740
Get up!

20:07.774 --> 20:10.777
Come on, it's a practice!
Surround me.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.846
Come on, surround me,
come on. Move!

20:13.880 --> 20:15.848
My goodness.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.451
Come on!

20:18.485 --> 20:20.320
Why does he keep
driving them on

20:20.353 --> 20:22.355
when they're almost
too tired to stand up?

20:22.389 --> 20:23.990
ROLAND: Move!
He's a machine.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.858
I suppose there's no point
in telling Roland

20:25.892 --> 20:26.993
they'll be dead
tomorrow anyway.

20:28.595 --> 20:32.299
You attack me, understand?
You attack me.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.533
And always remember,

20:33.566 --> 20:35.935
( grunting )

20:35.968 --> 20:37.370
it's not about weapons.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.407
In here
it counts.

20:47.079 --> 20:51.017
It's not over yet.
Come on, come on, come on!

20:52.985 --> 20:55.288
( both grunting )

20:59.559 --> 21:00.760
ROLAND:
Attack me.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.333
( grunting )

21:07.334 --> 21:08.267
Come on.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.271
( grunting )

21:13.706 --> 21:16.476
Now you. Take my sword.

21:18.010 --> 21:18.978
Aah!

21:31.491 --> 21:33.326
Fight well...

21:35.094 --> 21:37.430
or die badly.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.737
Sir.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.482
I wonder how many
will die tonight.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.061
( ominous theme playing )

22:29.081 --> 22:30.450
( doors open )

22:33.786 --> 22:35.722
Didn't mean to scare you.

22:35.755 --> 22:38.057
Permanent state
around here.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.460
All right,
my useless nephew,

22:40.493 --> 22:44.631
where did you put
the replacement bolts, huh?

22:44.664 --> 22:46.032
Just once it would be good

22:46.065 --> 22:47.834
if he put something
where it's supposed to be.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.802
Oh, he's a good kid,
give him a chance.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.037
He'll be fine.

22:51.070 --> 22:54.574
Yeah, if he don't get us
all killed first.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.478
You all right out there?
Oh, yeah.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.379
I'll have
some of that later.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.619
( door closes )

23:15.728 --> 23:18.831
I must apologize
for the quality of the food.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.200
We did stockpile supplies
for the past three years

23:21.233 --> 23:22.869
in case of such an emergency,

23:22.902 --> 23:25.938
and so provisions were not
initially a problem.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.875
But now, nothing getting in,
nothing getting out...

23:28.908 --> 23:30.677
KYRA:
And even when the storeroom
was full,

23:30.710 --> 23:32.679
it didn't contain
a single thing

23:32.712 --> 23:34.080
that was of any interest
to our intruder

23:34.113 --> 23:37.116
who seems to prefer us.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.586
This is my daughter,
Kyra.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.789
We've already met.

23:47.827 --> 23:50.730
Will your wife
be joining us?

23:50.763 --> 23:52.532
My wife died
many years ago.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.503
It was a tragic accident.

23:58.738 --> 24:03.876
She was new to the outpost,
walking alone at night.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.444
She fell
from the battlements.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.982
Do you have family,
Beowulf?

24:10.016 --> 24:13.119
I've never wanted
a family.

24:13.152 --> 24:17.690
I thought it only natural
to desire a home, family.

24:17.724 --> 24:21.060
Then I've
no natural desires.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.663
Interesting.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.031
How so?

24:25.064 --> 24:27.567
BEOWULF:
Since I have no desire
to stay in one place,

24:27.600 --> 24:29.268
a home would be
useless.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.171
And I have no desire
for a family,

24:32.204 --> 24:34.541
since I don't wanna
create more like me.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.644
So that your ego can rest
assured of your uniqueness?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.515
Exactly.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.859
You must excuse
my daughter.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.728
She's always been a woman
of her own mind.

24:55.762 --> 24:58.765
And my father has always been
an expert at making my excuses.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.002
( ominous theme playing )

25:38.938 --> 25:40.573
Damn.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.987
Oh, Karl?

25:55.021 --> 25:56.623
I, uh, dropped
my glasses somewhere.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.190
You see them anywhere?

26:01.127 --> 26:02.629
Karl?

26:05.164 --> 26:07.066
Is that you, Karl?

26:07.099 --> 26:08.300
( beast growling )

26:11.638 --> 26:14.874
If there was a high point
it was the Underlands Siege.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.277
I remember.
It was an active year.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.880
We were fighting continuously
under great pressure.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.884
But we were strong.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.988
Because the fighters
worked together as a unit.

26:29.021 --> 26:32.058
I don't think after
those advances we should...

26:32.091 --> 26:34.727
Is something wrong?
Can you sense it?

26:34.761 --> 26:36.028
Sense what?

26:39.131 --> 26:41.734
This is bullshit!
What is it?

26:43.169 --> 26:46.005
Evil, it's here.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.779
Hrothgar,
this is ridiculous.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.380
We need fighting men
not lunatics.

26:54.413 --> 26:55.715
Roland, be quiet.

26:55.748 --> 26:56.749
What, me?

26:56.783 --> 26:58.350
( panting )

26:58.384 --> 27:01.087
The weapon master,
he's dead.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.356
( mysterious theme playing )

27:07.960 --> 27:08.895
( Kyra whimpering )

27:21.073 --> 27:23.275
It's changing
its method.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.245
Never killed
so early before.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.347
It knows.

27:44.864 --> 27:49.769
ROLAND:
I'm sorry, Will.
You're the weapons master now.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.008
( crying )

28:03.315 --> 28:04.316
Promotion.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.120
Yeah, not too
comforting, huh?

28:08.154 --> 28:09.789
You could say that.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.091
Well, of course,
everyone's gonna die anyway.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.761
One thing's for sure is that
I ain't no weapons master.

28:14.794 --> 28:17.429
You don't have to be good
all the time.

28:17.463 --> 28:20.332
Just when
it matters.

28:59.371 --> 29:00.472
KYRA:
You're not really here

29:00.506 --> 29:03.342
because of my husband's
death, are you?

29:06.212 --> 29:09.215
No.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.084
But if I was,
I would be after Roland.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.186
So why would you be afraid?

29:15.988 --> 29:17.489
I'm not afraid.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.260
I can't afford
to be afraid.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.097
Don't you have
any fear?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.400
Fear is all I know.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.102
You can feel it.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.373
You can sense it.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.508
Yes.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.079
You said, it knows.

29:42.014 --> 29:42.849
What did you mean?

29:45.151 --> 29:47.086
It knows I'm here.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.093
What are you?

29:54.126 --> 29:57.129
I'm trapped
between two worlds.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.498
That's what I am.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.416
You can't have her.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.319
I'm not in your way.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.421
I think you are.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.091
You manipulate her
and Hrothgar, but not me.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.864
We need each other.
I need no one.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.032
You better go.

30:34.366 --> 30:38.237
I have to stay.
Then you fight.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.339
( electronic theme
playing )

30:53.619 --> 30:55.554
( grunting )

31:19.078 --> 31:21.213
Don't push your luck,
Roland.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.883
Stay sharp.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.170
( dramatic theme playing )

32:23.375 --> 32:26.078
I'm here to sweeten
your dreams, my love.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.352
( moans )

32:46.698 --> 32:48.967
( panting )

33:11.290 --> 33:13.159
It's almost finished, my love.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.728
It's almost finished, my love.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.297
( gasps )

33:18.330 --> 33:20.266
( breathing heavily )

33:50.462 --> 33:52.198
( dramatic theme playing )

34:29.635 --> 34:32.538
( door opens )

34:47.418 --> 34:49.821
Ah! God damn!

34:49.855 --> 34:52.491
Jeez, Karl,
get a grip, man.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.226
Sorry, I thought
I heard something.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.196
Yeah, you heard me.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.801
You know, with all the real
cool ways to die around here,

35:02.834 --> 35:04.803
I'd rather not go
by heart attack.

35:06.705 --> 35:10.176
Ah, let's see.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.644
Look at all this. You'd think
with all this stuff

35:12.678 --> 35:15.414
you'd be able
to kick some ass.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.616
How do you tell all the junk
from the critical stuff?

35:17.649 --> 35:20.219
Your uncle knew.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.821
Yeah, well, that's
real helpful, Karl.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.424
Okay, come on, let's go,
let's go. Let's do something.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.825
I'll get the blasters.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.594
( sighs )

35:51.283 --> 35:53.452
WILL:
Hey, Karl.
I think I broke it.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.853
Can you come
fix this damn thing?

35:54.886 --> 35:56.522
I'll get the blasters.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.878
( machinery whirring )

36:28.387 --> 36:30.256
( door opens )

36:30.289 --> 36:33.892
Will? You okay?

36:38.930 --> 36:42.301
( object clatters )

36:42.334 --> 36:43.869
( ominous theme playing )

37:05.291 --> 37:07.926
( beast growling )

37:18.604 --> 37:20.939
( coughs )

37:20.972 --> 37:22.308
Oh, man, I saw it.

37:24.443 --> 37:25.744
How big was it?

37:25.777 --> 37:28.514
What kind of armor?

37:28.547 --> 37:30.916
Was it shielded?
Was it exposed?

37:30.949 --> 37:33.352
It was...

37:33.385 --> 37:35.020
It was ugly.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.331
It came in broad daylight.

37:45.364 --> 37:49.401
It's tiring of the game.
It wants it done.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.541
Put the women and the children
into the sanctuary.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.376
Everyone else patrols
in threes

37:57.409 --> 37:59.678
and keep visual contact
at all times.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.279
Kyra.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.083
I won't be herded
and locked away.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.453
I'm fighting this time.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.721
You will join the others
in the sanctuary.

38:09.755 --> 38:13.592
A little late to start
protecting me, isn't it, father?

38:25.437 --> 38:27.906
( dramatic rock theme playing )

38:40.151 --> 38:42.388
( chattering )

38:49.628 --> 38:51.763
MAN:
Hurry up, hurry up.

38:51.797 --> 38:52.731
Hurry up.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.812
Where's Kyra?
Where is she?

39:06.845 --> 39:08.414
WOMAN:
I don't know where she is.
I haven't seen her.

39:15.821 --> 39:16.822
Move in now.

39:16.855 --> 39:17.923
Make sure both doors
are bolted.

39:17.956 --> 39:18.890
Yes, sir.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.941
All sanctuary
doors secured.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.879
All sanctuary
doors secured.

39:52.958 --> 39:56.161
What is it?
Is there any other way in?

39:56.194 --> 39:59.164
All doors are secured
from the inside.

40:01.099 --> 40:01.967
( beast growling )

40:02.000 --> 40:04.436
( people screaming )

40:16.515 --> 40:18.884

40:27.859 --> 40:29.595

45:38.069 --> 45:41.539
Me! Fight me!

45:41.572 --> 45:42.941
( groans )

45:44.810 --> 45:47.779
Not you.

45:58.089 --> 45:59.825
( moans )

46:04.395 --> 46:05.563
KYRA:
Please.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.532
( groaning )

46:10.836 --> 46:12.303
I can't...

46:20.879 --> 46:22.280
Damn!

47:37.155 --> 47:38.323
How is he?

47:41.526 --> 47:43.028
Dying.

47:44.462 --> 47:46.231
He saved my life.

47:52.137 --> 47:54.205
I need
more bandages.

47:54.239 --> 47:56.341
He wounded the beast.

47:59.677 --> 48:01.246
Yes.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.488
That gives us a chance.

48:12.523 --> 48:14.192
Perhaps.

48:20.565 --> 48:22.433
Kyra.

48:26.471 --> 48:29.140
All I've ever wanted
was you.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.314
I know.

48:38.583 --> 48:40.318
I know.

48:45.490 --> 48:47.225
( dramatic theme playing )

49:09.014 --> 49:10.715
It won't be long now.

49:36.407 --> 49:38.143
( dramatic theme playing )

49:47.418 --> 49:50.388
Sweet dreams, my love.

50:38.869 --> 50:40.638
( moans )

50:54.519 --> 50:57.788
Feel it. The life
your husband put it my belly.

50:57.822 --> 50:59.424
( laughing )

51:04.662 --> 51:06.397
It's almost finished,
my love.

51:09.834 --> 51:11.736
It's almost finished,
my love.

51:11.769 --> 51:13.504
( gasping )

52:11.796 --> 52:13.664
( suspenseful theme playing )

52:19.470 --> 52:21.739
Don't be afraid.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.315
You should be dead.

52:30.348 --> 52:32.550
Many times.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.220
Explain.

52:36.554 --> 52:38.423
I'm a quick healer.

52:38.456 --> 52:40.325
Not good enough.

52:40.358 --> 52:42.460
That's all I can say.

52:42.493 --> 52:44.429
Because you're afraid

52:44.462 --> 52:45.796
the truth
will send me running?

52:45.830 --> 52:49.600
From what
I've seen of you, no.

52:49.634 --> 52:50.901
But because
there is no time.

52:55.740 --> 52:56.841
( door opens )

52:58.476 --> 53:00.411
BEOWULF:
Enjoying the view?

53:13.458 --> 53:16.961
A remarkable recovery.

53:16.994 --> 53:19.797
BEOWULF:
It wasn't as bad
as it looked.

53:22.400 --> 53:25.536
We all have our secrets,
I suppose.

53:28.473 --> 53:32.310
Tell me,
if a man fights

53:32.343 --> 53:34.979
a creature of evil,

53:35.012 --> 53:39.317
then he cannot
be evil himself.

53:39.350 --> 53:41.952
Can he?

53:41.986 --> 53:44.755
If you're looking
for absolution,

53:44.789 --> 53:46.891
you're asking
the wrong man.

53:52.430 --> 53:57.668
Whoever you are,
whatever you are,

53:57.702 --> 54:00.037
I thank you
for your help.

54:00.070 --> 54:01.772
Why...

54:03.441 --> 54:05.242
"not you"?

54:19.757 --> 54:21.626
( footsteps approaching )

54:27.832 --> 54:30.768
( gasps )

54:30.801 --> 54:32.002
WILL:
You scared
the hell out of me.

54:32.036 --> 54:34.939
I need you
to make me something.

54:34.972 --> 54:36.574
I need it now.

54:36.607 --> 54:38.509
( sighs )

54:38.543 --> 54:40.611
Yeah, what is it?

54:40.645 --> 54:43.013
I'll show you.

54:43.047 --> 54:44.415
But no mistakes.

54:46.484 --> 54:47.918
( sighs )

54:47.952 --> 54:49.787
All right, no sweat.

54:49.820 --> 54:54.625
This is the time.
It matters.

54:57.395 --> 54:59.063
( mysterious theme playing )

55:03.734 --> 55:05.903
BEOWULF:
How's your leg?

55:05.936 --> 55:09.740
My injuries don't heal
as well as yours.

55:09.774 --> 55:12.343
I'll be little help
like this.

55:12.377 --> 55:15.613
One day you'll have
to teach me your trick, ugh.

55:17.382 --> 55:19.617
What can I do?

55:19.650 --> 55:21.519
Nothing.

55:23.488 --> 55:25.523
It'll be over tonight?

55:25.556 --> 55:28.092
Yes, one way or another.

55:28.125 --> 55:30.528
It's time.

55:30.561 --> 55:33.498
It will come for me.

55:33.531 --> 55:35.866
But I will know where
it's coming from and when.

55:46.043 --> 55:48.679
There's one thing
you should know about Nivri.

55:50.180 --> 55:54.151
His family is
very wealthy, very rich.

55:54.184 --> 55:56.387
The marriage was arranged
by Hrothgar.

55:56.421 --> 56:01.158
Nivri was not Kyra's choice.
He was a sadist and a pig.

56:01.191 --> 56:05.129
He treated her badly,
very badly.

56:05.162 --> 56:06.764
But you didn't kill him?

56:06.797 --> 56:08.833
No, but I tried.

56:08.866 --> 56:10.735
I even challenged
the bastard to a fight,

56:10.768 --> 56:12.470
but Hrothgar made me
back off.

56:17.442 --> 56:18.776
You know, don't you?

56:23.748 --> 56:27.685
She thinks of me
as a brother.

56:32.623 --> 56:35.426
That's all
I could ever be.

56:38.829 --> 56:40.598
I've survived
a lot of pain.

56:40.631 --> 56:42.433
Warriors do.

56:42.467 --> 56:44.869
Heh, yeah.

56:44.902 --> 56:46.136
( sighs )

56:46.170 --> 56:49.707
But nothing
to compare with that.

56:57.081 --> 57:00.084
And its miserable life...

57:00.117 --> 57:01.952
tonight.

57:11.862 --> 57:13.097
Is it done?

57:13.130 --> 57:14.632
Yeah.

57:21.639 --> 57:23.073
Have you tested it?

57:23.107 --> 57:24.875
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It works fine.

57:24.909 --> 57:26.877
Works great.

57:26.911 --> 57:28.513
Most of the time.

57:28.546 --> 57:33.250
No, it's fine.
It's fine. It's fine.

57:33.283 --> 57:34.819
Hey, listen, man.

57:34.852 --> 57:36.554
Are you gonna take
this beast thing or not?

57:36.587 --> 57:39.524
You don't want me
to ruin the surprise.

57:39.557 --> 57:41.058
( Will chuckles )

57:41.091 --> 57:44.194
Waking up in the morning
is surprise enough.

57:44.228 --> 57:45.496
( door opens )

57:45.530 --> 57:47.698
( sighs )

58:00.210 --> 58:01.779
Beowulf...

58:06.584 --> 58:08.986
Don't do this.

58:09.019 --> 58:12.557
We all do
what we have to do.

58:12.590 --> 58:14.825
You know that well,
I think.

58:16.927 --> 58:19.129
Is that the knife
you used on your husband?

58:27.037 --> 58:28.739
What are you?

58:34.144 --> 58:37.181
Secrets are hard to keep.

58:40.284 --> 58:41.952
It was night.

58:44.321 --> 58:46.557
He'd been drinking
as usual.

58:48.793 --> 58:50.561
He wanted me.

58:53.097 --> 58:54.865
I refused.

58:57.167 --> 58:59.536
He started to beat me.

59:03.140 --> 59:05.142
So I stabbed him.

59:06.944 --> 59:08.613
Over...

59:09.914 --> 59:11.315
and over.

59:14.685 --> 59:17.154
And the whole time,

59:17.187 --> 59:19.556
he just stood there,

59:21.258 --> 59:23.293
looking surprised.

59:29.166 --> 59:32.236
Now he's come back
to kill us.

59:32.269 --> 59:34.639
One by one.

59:36.707 --> 59:39.810
Saving me for the last.

59:39.844 --> 59:42.913
The beast
is not your husband.

59:44.749 --> 59:45.850
What makes you so sure?

59:45.883 --> 59:49.353
Ghosts don't eat people.

59:49.386 --> 59:51.155
This is not your doing.

59:51.188 --> 59:53.658
If someone is to blame,
it's not you.

59:53.691 --> 59:56.827
Maybe not for
the first strike,

59:56.861 --> 59:59.229
but for the second

59:59.263 --> 01:00:02.800
and the third
and the fourth.

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.334
It was justified.

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:05.803
It was murder.

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:07.071
Yes.

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:40.070
( thudding )

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:43.040
( suspenseful theme playing )

01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:39.857
( growls )

01:02:59.043 --> 01:03:00.510
( gasps )

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:05.082
( sobbing )

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:32.910
I, uh...

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:35.012
I made mistakes.

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:44.188
Oh, forgive me.

01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:02.006
( growling )

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:34.338
( upbeat theme playing )

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:50.454
( grunting )

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.073
( intense theme playing )

01:05:17.982 --> 01:05:19.516
( growling )

01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:35.532
I've been waiting for you.

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:38.102
One of us is
the other's death.

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:43.407
I'm like you.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.142
I'm one of the damned.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:46.110
BEAST:
Kill!

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:28.118
( growling and screaming )

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.357
( Beast screaming )

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:33.750
Weaponsmaster,
open the wine cellar.

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:36.353
( sighs )

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:45.229
I think you ought to take
a look at this, sir.

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:51.568
MAN:
My God.

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:53.603
Looks like
they've done it.

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:55.572
Look at the size
of that thing.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:08:01.645
Okay.
We're finished here.

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:04.614
Break it all down.
We're moving out.

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:30.174
Not one scratch.

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:34.877
I'm impressed.

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:37.613
So, now it's over,
I suppose you'll be leaving us.

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:39.349
I've finished here.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.486
Well, then
you'll leave without

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:44.321
knowing
my biggest secret.

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.490
There's more?

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:50.327
One more.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.728
And that is?

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.567
How I feel.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.336
( slow waltz theme playing )

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.573
What are you scared of?

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:06.310
This is my life.

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:08.377
It can't be shared.

01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:10.779
Especially with anyone
that cares for me.

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.683
You're afraid of me.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:18.354
No. I'm not afraid of you.

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:19.956
I'm afraid for you.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.758
But I've finally
found something

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:22.859
that I never thought I would

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.828
in this place of death
and misery.

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:27.631
You mustn't love me.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:28.832
But that's for me
to say.

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:30.567
How do you know
it wasn't me

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.337
that drew you
to this place?

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:35.404
Because you're not evil.
Maybe not,

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:43.880
but tonight
I am full of magic.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:50.886
( upbeat theme playing )

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.256
HROTHGAR:
Let's drink a toast.

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:59.696
To us.
For surviving.

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:04.801
And to those who didn't.

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:21.951
To Beowulf.
ALL: To Beowulf.

01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:39.936
( sighs )

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:58.688
Who's there?

01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:00.324
Who are you?

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:04.728
Why, I'm your dreams
and desires come to life.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:08.665
Heh, this is not a dream.

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:12.969
You're right.

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:16.840
Tell me, is this
real enough for you?

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:20.944
( mysterious theme playing )

01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:23.046
Where do you come from?

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:25.782
How the hell
did you get in here?

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:32.422
Where I came from
is not important.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:36.893
What you should ask
is why I'm here.

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:41.531
So, why are you here?

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.870
To tell you something
about the ways of women.

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:48.672
She's treated you badly.

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:56.045
Such a foolish girl.

01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:58.415
You're so much more
a man than him.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:05.822
So much more.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:14.063
I don't have time
for this.

01:12:14.097 --> 01:12:15.999
There's nothing left
to do tonight.

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:18.402
Everyone's out celebrating
their survival.

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:24.641
Why not you?
You deserve the best.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:29.613
Such loyalty.
You've given so much.

01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:31.948
And you've
so much more to give.

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:38.922
Any woman would be very
lucky to have you.

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:41.625
Any woman.

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:43.860
Let me be your comfort.

01:12:47.764 --> 01:12:49.365
( grunts )

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:13.690
So now you have
to tell me who you are.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.992
It's what lovers do.

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:25.435
I'll find out
one way or another.

01:13:25.469 --> 01:13:28.004
Are you threatening me?

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:30.640
I could think
of worse things.

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:36.680
I want to know.

01:13:44.488 --> 01:13:46.556
( slow waltz theme playing )

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:54.498
My mother's family had
an outpost like this one.

01:13:57.066 --> 01:13:59.102
One night
when she was young,

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:02.639
she saw a light.

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:05.809
A beautiful silver light
that called her name.

01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:09.646
She was drawn.

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:14.150
She followed it
to an opening in the hill

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:16.152
that never existed before.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:18.955
And inside
he was waiting for her.

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:20.690
He?

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:28.632
Every night for three months
she went to him.

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:32.268
Then the last night
of the third month

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:35.071
he told her
she was pregnant.

01:14:36.673 --> 01:14:38.007
And she was
to name the child--

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:39.709
Beowulf.

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:43.547
Who was he?

01:14:44.881 --> 01:14:47.884
My mother died
never knowing.

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:50.620
But the elders
had no doubts.

01:14:51.855 --> 01:14:54.624
They told me
my father was Bale,

01:14:54.658 --> 01:14:57.260
God of Darkness,
Lord of Lies.

01:14:57.293 --> 01:14:59.262
You don't believe that?

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:06.703
The only thing that stops me
from becoming evil

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:10.106
is fighting evil.

01:15:13.677 --> 01:15:16.646
So this is how
it must be?

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.949
Battle after battle?

01:15:19.983 --> 01:15:22.151
Until you die?

01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:23.720
Yes.

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:26.055
This is how it must be.

01:15:28.124 --> 01:15:30.259
How can--
Shh.

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:34.030
What?

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:36.700
You're scaring me.
What?

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:38.234
It's here.

01:15:41.204 --> 01:15:42.071
What's here?

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:45.675
You killed it.

01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:49.245
Not the beast.
Something older, subtler.

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:51.681
Let me come with you.

01:15:55.018 --> 01:15:56.620
No, please.

01:15:57.954 --> 01:15:59.823
Get back with the others.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.095
You were right.

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:09.599
It was your magic
that brought me here.

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:15.672
( door closes )

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:18.241
Ah, then maybe
it'll be my magic

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:20.109
that brings you back.

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:28.184
( suspenseful theme playing )

01:16:52.876 --> 01:16:54.410
HROTHGAR:
Kyra, where've you been?

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:55.945
We were waiting for you.

01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:59.048
It's not over.
We need to warn the others.

01:17:22.772 --> 01:17:23.940
( Kyra panting )

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.764
( both gasp )

01:18:03.747 --> 01:18:05.414
KYRA:
My friend.

01:18:09.853 --> 01:18:11.788
( wind whistling )

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.497
Have you come for me,
my love?

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.266
( upbeat theme playing )

01:18:24.968 --> 01:18:26.870
You weren't so shy

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:28.872
when you took
this outpost and me.

01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:34.477
Is this any way to treat
your long lost lover?

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:40.083
Who is this, father?

01:18:40.116 --> 01:18:41.818
( laughs )

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.255
After we stormed the outpost,
she was waiting.

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:48.191
She came to me
in the night.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.425
What?

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:52.528
Heh, and what pleasures
we had.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:55.131
You're the reason
my wife killed herself.

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:59.068
Heh, oh, no no, no, love
That was your honor.

01:18:59.102 --> 01:19:00.870
It was your face she watched
when she jumped

01:19:00.904 --> 01:19:02.371
No.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:05.241
You whore!

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:07.110
Harsh words for
the mother of your child.

01:19:09.312 --> 01:19:10.279
What?

01:19:10.313 --> 01:19:12.181
The one you call the beast,

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:14.083
he's your son, Grendel.

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:16.853
Conceived at the height
of victorious bloodshed.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:20.890
Impossible.

01:19:20.924 --> 01:19:22.358
That thing's not human.

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:23.993
Heh, he's half.

01:19:24.027 --> 01:19:25.829
That's why he's so handsome.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.934
All this for love spurned?

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:33.469
Love?
You are so simple.

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:35.338
Long before
the outpost was built,

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:37.173
this was my land
and my home.

01:19:37.206 --> 01:19:38.975
My son
has the older claim.

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:40.977
He has come
for what is his right.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:44.513
I thank God now for
the opportunity to kill you.

01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:46.349
( Beast growling )

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:48.784
( Hrothgar screaming )

01:19:54.457 --> 01:19:56.059
( Kyra screams )

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:06.870
( Beast screaming )

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:12.008
( screams )

01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:20.950
That was a mistake.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:27.623
No mistake.

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:30.526
I only kill
when I have to.

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:32.461
You kill for pleasure.

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:35.564
Hmm, their blood
was sweet.

01:20:35.598 --> 01:20:40.336
I sucked their veins,
chewed their bones.

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:42.138
Wet and still alive.

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:45.474
Hot blood pumping
down my throat.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:48.411
Mm.

01:20:50.113 --> 01:20:53.049
You should try it.
It will appeal to you.

01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:55.885
You know nothing about
what appeals to me.

01:20:55.919 --> 01:20:59.455
Don't I?
How will her blood taste?

01:20:59.488 --> 01:21:02.258
You've wondered.
You can't help it.

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.627
You look at her,
your blood pumps.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:09.332
Your mouth becomes wet.

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:11.034
You haven't confused
that hunger

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:12.468
for something else,
I hope.

01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:15.171
I'm not confused.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.273
I know exactly
why I'm here.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.613
Tell me, what blood
mingles with yours?

01:21:24.647 --> 01:21:26.382
Who spread
your mother's legs

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:30.353
and gave you the strength
to overcome my son?

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:33.022
Someone stronger
than you.

01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:35.524
Heh, that's doubtful.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:38.928
I know you feel
the pull towards me.

01:21:38.962 --> 01:21:40.463
You can't help it.

01:21:40.496 --> 01:21:43.899
I need you inside of me.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:50.306
You are on the edge
of control now.

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:53.442
With fresh kills
inches away...

01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:56.012
and me so close,

01:21:56.045 --> 01:21:59.215
aching for you.

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:09.725
Does it burn in you?
The hunger?

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:12.996
For blood? For flesh?

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:17.100
Is it sweet to you,
the scent of my son's kills?

01:22:17.133 --> 01:22:19.102
Tell me, hero.

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:21.737
Whose world do you
really belong to,

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.406
theirs or mine?

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:27.243
Here and now,
it's just you and me.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.478
And I will see,
you pay for your sins.

01:22:29.512 --> 01:22:31.414
Do you dare?

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:33.082
Would you know me?

01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:37.253
I'm old, child.
Older than sin.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:38.487
Would you take me here
in the dark?

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.356
Do your loins
at this moment,

01:22:40.389 --> 01:22:43.026
at this moment of death,
do they burn for me?

01:22:43.059 --> 01:22:45.261
I burn.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:46.495
But not for you.

01:22:48.097 --> 01:22:49.765
So be it.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.167
You've come for answers.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.702
See what
the truth brings you.

( upbeat theme playing )

01:23:16.092 --> 01:23:17.660
Come, child,

01:23:17.693 --> 01:23:21.697
sample the true delights
of flesh with me.

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.732
Feel what no human woman
can offer you.

Come on. Let's go.

01:25:27.556 --> 01:25:30.393
Come on, we have to go.

01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:44.273
( neighing )

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:09.665
I lost everyone
I loved in that place.

01:26:11.234 --> 01:26:13.602
My whole life was there.

01:26:15.304 --> 01:26:16.472
Where will you go?

01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:20.543
With you.

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:23.546
I don't know
where I'm going,

01:26:23.579 --> 01:26:26.449
or what I'll find
when I get there.

01:26:26.482 --> 01:26:30.219
If I stay with you,
the darkness will seek me out.

01:26:30.253 --> 01:26:32.388
And how would
I protect you?

01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:35.258
I'll show you...

01:26:35.291 --> 01:26:37.493
if you let me.

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:41.230
It's not safe to be
with me.

01:26:43.766 --> 01:26:45.801
It's clear to me
that by your side

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:47.836
is the safest place
there is.

01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:51.440
I can't make you
any guarantees.

01:26:51.474 --> 01:26:54.377
( Beowulf laughing )

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.845
