I've always wanted to know.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.602
Hey, can we, uh, set the mood?

09:19.646 --> 09:21.386
Computer, resume program.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.084
-T'ANA: I was on the Algonquin.
-[gunfire]

09:23.127 --> 09:25.434
Aah! Aw, man.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.182
BOIMLER: All right,
we're making great time.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.618
No way is Delta shift beating us
to that terminal.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.185
They better not.
This is taking forever.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.882
Well, I think the view

09:38.926 --> 09:40.754
from our new quarters
will more than make up for it.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.973
Plus, we're in parts of the
ship almost nobody gets to see.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.975
I think this is super cool.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.240
Ugh. [gags] Ugh.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.678
Uh, if by super cool
you mean super gross.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.636
Why do we even
have a swamp on board?

09:53.680 --> 09:55.203
We're under the hydroponics bay.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.683
It's great
for biomedical research,

09:56.726 --> 09:58.119
or just for flower fans.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.599
What kind of weirdo signs up

09:59.642 --> 10:01.862
for a job
in outer space just to garden?

10:01.905 --> 10:03.167
[birds singing]

10:03.211 --> 10:05.605
Ah, the path to Kamata
in spring.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.650
Whoop. Oh, Gramble,

10:07.694 --> 10:10.610
his throat slit
by his mistress.

10:10.653 --> 10:13.090
[gasps]

10:13.134 --> 10:14.831
A Tamarian defrin root.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.441
They can grow without water.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.356
All they need is high levels
of nitrous oxide.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.489
Uh, is it safe for us
to be breathing that?

10:20.532 --> 10:22.534
Oh. Well, I know
Orions are immune

10:22.578 --> 10:23.797
to its hallucinogenic
properties.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.800
[distorted]:
But as for humans...

10:26.843 --> 10:28.758
Um...

10:28.802 --> 10:30.586
Boimler, what is up
with your head?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.675
You look like
a goddamn sea creature.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.285
[giggling]

10:34.329 --> 10:38.420
My head? What about your arms?
[laughing]

10:38.463 --> 10:40.857
Yeah, I mean,
I don't hate it, though.

10:40.901 --> 10:43.599
Hey, guys, this is actually
so funny. Look at this.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.124
It says oxygen levels
are depleting. [laughing]

10:47.168 --> 10:50.214
[laughs]
I can taste sounds? What?

10:50.258 --> 10:51.955
[high-pitched voice]:
We have to get out of here.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.088
[mocking]: Oh, we have to
get out of here. [chuckles]

10:54.131 --> 10:57.091
BOIMLER [echoing]:
How? It's a maze.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.919
What? What...

10:58.962 --> 11:00.398
-what maze?
-BOIMLER: Okay,

11:00.442 --> 11:02.009
you guys stay here
and feed the rabbits.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.619
I'm gonna find a way
through this maze. [panting]

11:03.663 --> 11:06.448
-No! What?!
-I am trapped inside of an egg.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.102
-Come on.
-No, leave me alone.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.886
-I don't want to hatch.
-Ooh, I've found the door.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.758
-Ugh. We have to go. Now.
-No, I do.

11:11.801 --> 11:14.151
-[alarm beeps]
-[Boimler grunts]

11:14.195 --> 11:16.023
-[grunts]
-Ow!

11:16.066 --> 11:17.851
-I said go! Hyah! Hyah!
-[whimpers]

11:17.894 --> 11:19.853
-Why are you being so mean? Ow.
-[grunting]

11:19.896 --> 11:22.246
[grunts, sighs]

11:22.290 --> 11:23.900
[heavy breathing]

11:23.944 --> 11:26.686
Whew. Sorry-sorry
about that whole egg thing.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.340
That's okay.
I'm sorry I made you hatch.

11:30.385 --> 11:33.127
It's okay. It's just,
oh, it was so warm in there.

11:34.171 --> 11:37.958
Ooh, that Tellarite mud bath
was phenomenal.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.221
I'm glad you enjoyed it,
and even more pleased

11:40.264 --> 11:43.615
to see your team taking full
advantage of our sand garden.

11:43.659 --> 11:47.054
Feeling your stress
slide away into the sand?

11:47.097 --> 11:49.143
Oh, yeah.
Oh, we're really cookin'.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.319
Oh, nice. Wait a minute.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.147
Is that a design schematic?

11:53.190 --> 11:55.192
Yup. This little honey
will improve the Cerritos

11:55.236 --> 11:57.717
engine efficiency by .5%.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.761
No. No, no, no, no, no.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.720
You are here to relax.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.418
Like, look.
Meredith's got the right idea.

12:03.461 --> 12:06.769
Mmm. Right there.
That's the spot.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.119
Ensign, working out
all those kinks?

12:09.163 --> 12:11.339
Oh, yeah, it's just about ready
to get tested.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.864
I'm sorry. Excuse me?
Ugh. This is unbelievable.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.823
Sorry. Was I the only one
sneaking in a little build time?

12:16.866 --> 12:18.694
FREEMAN [muttering]: They won't
relax. Why won't they relax?

12:18.738 --> 12:21.001
This is ridiculous.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.916
I'm all for adventure, Boims,
but it'd be nice

12:22.959 --> 12:25.701
if your little shortcut wasn't
actually more of a long cut.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.790
Look, I know, I know. It's just,
after all these retrofits,

12:27.834 --> 12:29.792
a lot of this stuff
isn't even labeled.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.403
I mean, like this.
Uh, ladies first?

12:32.447 --> 12:33.622
-Absolutely not.
-Yeah, right.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.145
Cool, cool. I got this.

12:37.495 --> 12:40.803
-Holy cow.
-Ooh!

12:40.847 --> 12:43.153
Whoa. Check it out.
Gravity's super low.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.764
Ha, ha. Okay.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.070
-This is a much better room.
-[whooping]

12:47.114 --> 12:48.898
All right, Boims,
I'll give you this one.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.074
This is a good shortcut.
Ooh.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.511
[laughing]

12:53.555 --> 12:55.209
-BOIMLER: Oh, look at me go.
-Whoa.

12:55.252 --> 12:56.732
BOIMLER: Feels so free to do
this without an EV suit.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.778
-Come on, Boimler.
-[laughing]

12:58.821 --> 13:00.562
Delta shift probably isn't
goofing off like this.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.390
We got to go
if we want to beat them.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.088
Ha. I'm not Boimler.
I'm Antigrav Boy,

13:05.132 --> 13:09.527
protector of the lower decks.
[whoops]

13:11.921 --> 13:14.489
Commander, a small
asteroid cluster is approaching.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.491
Should I target
with all phasers?

13:16.534 --> 13:18.885
What? No. This is what
we have a deflector for.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.539
Reroute power and
let the dish take care of it.

13:21.583 --> 13:22.932
[beeping]

13:22.976 --> 13:24.455
[whooshing]

13:24.499 --> 13:25.674
-Uh-oh. Huh?
-[gasps]

13:28.677 --> 13:29.678
Aah!

13:29.721 --> 13:31.506
Help me!

13:31.549 --> 13:34.509
-Whoa!
-Aah! [grunting]

13:34.552 --> 13:36.903
-[both grunting]
-[Boimler whimpering]

13:36.946 --> 13:38.513
He's getting flattened.
We need to make a tether.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.254
Uh, got it!

13:40.297 --> 13:42.517
BOIMLER:
Oh, my God! Oh, no. No!

13:42.560 --> 13:43.648
Hold on!

13:43.692 --> 13:44.606
-[grunting]
-[groaning]

13:46.216 --> 13:50.133
-Ow!
-Mariner, pull!

13:50.177 --> 13:53.006
-[grunting]
-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

13:53.049 --> 13:56.052
[all panting]

13:56.096 --> 13:57.619
Antigrav Boy.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.708
-[chuckling]
-[chuckles weakly]

13:59.751 --> 14:01.492
TOZ:
The human ritual

14:01.536 --> 14:03.320
of mani-pedis is renowned

14:03.364 --> 14:06.367
across the quadrant
for its calming power.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.586
Also, I know it would keep their
eyes covered and hands busy.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.371
Well, seems like

14:10.414 --> 14:13.026
you've finally figured out
how to make them relax.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.637
TOZ: Not a single yellow
wristband in the bunch.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.422
Ah. Feeling good,
Mr. Rutherford?

14:18.466 --> 14:20.076
Oh, yeah, Captain.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.991
It's about time these
little piggies got pampered.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.080
If you like that,
you'll love the manicure.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.952
Oh, just the pedi's fine.

14:25.995 --> 14:29.172
Come on. You can't have a pedi
without a mani.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.914
It's like a pedi
for your hand-toes.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.003
Uh, no, thanks, not for me.

14:34.047 --> 14:37.093
Wait a minute.
Did you slide a cucumber slice

14:37.137 --> 14:39.790
under your wristband
to block the sensor?

14:39.835 --> 14:43.404
You engineered a workaround
to your own stress meter?

14:43.447 --> 14:45.232
I'm sorry.
We just wanted you to be happy.

14:45.275 --> 14:48.713
Damn it. Oh. What the hell
were you thinking?

14:48.757 --> 14:50.672
That the cucumber's hydrophilic
skin creates a natural fil...

14:50.715 --> 14:52.587
-Can it, Meredith.
-Sorry, Captain.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.719
We just didn't want our stress
to stress you out.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.460
This is a direct attack.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.288
I came here thinking
you respected me enough

14:58.332 --> 15:01.117
to give it a fair shot,
but no. No!

15:01.161 --> 15:04.425
-My engineers don't respect me.
-That's not true!

15:04.468 --> 15:06.470
It's just one deception
after another!

15:06.514 --> 15:08.603
I must be the worst captain
in the whole freakin' fleet,

15:08.646 --> 15:10.257
-a total joke.
-[beep]

15:10.300 --> 15:11.823
-[gasps]
-Am I amusing you?

15:11.867 --> 15:13.260
We have a black bander
on Deck Four.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.348
-Do I amuse you?
-Repeat: a black bander on Four.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.827
This is not a drill.

15:15.871 --> 15:18.308
Don't touch me! Just stand down.
I am a captain.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.744
We've been treating
the wrong patient.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.616
This woman is under
incredible stress.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.531
She hasn't recently
been possessed

15:23.574 --> 15:25.011
by any ancient artifacts,
has she?

15:25.054 --> 15:27.361
Uh... maybe a couple?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.798
[gasps]
Intensive treatment. Now!

15:29.841 --> 15:31.365
-Move.
-Oh, engineers. All of them.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.193
All of them are all
goddamned Geordi LaForges.

15:33.236 --> 15:34.759
What's gonna happen to her?

15:34.803 --> 15:37.197
She's been repressing
months' worth of stress,

15:37.240 --> 15:38.589
and you brought it all out.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.026
If she doesn't respond
to treatment, I'll have to

15:40.069 --> 15:42.115
send her to Earth
for a full medical diagnostic.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.160
But that would take her away
from the Cerritos.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.770
Something that
could have been avoided

15:45.814 --> 15:47.772
if you'd just followed
my treatments. But, no,

15:47.816 --> 15:50.775
you just had
to be hardworking. [grunts]

15:50.819 --> 15:54.214
She's right.
We didn't make an effort today.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.042
If that's what
the captain needs, then we need

15:56.085 --> 15:58.044
to figure out a way to stop
engineering

15:58.087 --> 16:00.872
-and start relaxing.
-[gasps]

16:00.916 --> 16:04.224
Sir, I think I know
what we shouldn't do.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.271
[grunting]

16:08.315 --> 16:10.491
This vent opens
for ten seconds once every hour.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.884
When it does, we'll have a
straight shot to the terminal.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.495
Great. So what do we do now?

16:14.538 --> 16:16.584
All we have to do is wait.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.196
When you get your room, what are
you gonna say to let people in?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.807
Yeah, Riker says
"Come," but like, "Come."

16:22.851 --> 16:25.288
So I guess I'll do that?
Do I sound cool? Come.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.595
I wish I could make fun,
but it does sound cool.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.684
I was thinking, "Enter, friend."

16:29.727 --> 16:31.512
So then whoever comes in
is your friend.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.209
[laughs]
I'm going to say "Come," too.

16:33.253 --> 16:34.645
No, don't do that. That's mine.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.170
-I like it. Come. Come.
-Come.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.650
-Enter, friend.
-[grunting]

16:39.694 --> 16:42.218
-Oh, great.
-Beta shifters?

16:42.262 --> 16:43.959
What the hell are you freaks
doing down here?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.352
Same as you, Delta shift.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.049
What took you so long, huh?

16:47.093 --> 16:49.356
Tuckered out from staying up
past your bedtimes?

16:49.399 --> 16:51.053
You know what?
Yeah. We're tired,

16:51.097 --> 16:52.533
and we've been through hell
to get here.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.969
I can't believe you're trying

16:54.013 --> 16:56.145
to bone in
on our room lottery plan.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.581
Aren't you Beta shifters
always crowing

16:57.625 --> 16:59.192
about how ethical you are?

16:59.235 --> 17:01.063
You sure you'll be able
to live with yourselves

17:01.107 --> 17:03.196
-if you hack that terminal?
-MARINER: Yeah, I don't know.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.848
I just feel like
all the Deck One perks

17:04.893 --> 17:06.634
and privacy'll help us
deal with it.

17:06.676 --> 17:09.070
Well, we're not going anywhere.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.682
Yeah. I didn't crawl through
a leftover Minooki aqueduct

17:11.726 --> 17:13.597
for nothing.
I'm drenched down to my soul.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.643
At least
you weren't in the holodeck

17:15.685 --> 17:17.992
for Shaxs' and T'Ana's
foreplay fantasy. Ugh.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.907
Oh, man, you ran into them, too?

17:19.951 --> 17:23.390
We heard them going to town
from behind stellar cartography.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.479
Aw. I knew
they were making progress.

17:25.521 --> 17:28.308
Yeah, they were definitely
making something.

17:28.351 --> 17:29.483
-Oh!
-[laughing]

17:29.526 --> 17:30.527
Ew.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.312
Barf.

17:32.355 --> 17:35.141
[laughing] I doubt they'll ever
let Dr. Migleemo choose

17:35.184 --> 17:36.925
which nebula to scan again
after that.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.101
Oh, oh, oh, I got a good one.
I got a really good one.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.885
Remember when Ransom
got turned into a caveman

17:40.929 --> 17:42.539
and they locked him
in the cafeteria?

17:42.583 --> 17:44.672
So, apparently,
when he was in there,

17:44.715 --> 17:47.370
he replicated this weird doll
out of churros

17:47.414 --> 17:50.069
and carried it around
like it was his wife.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.680
Everyone knows that.
People called her Churrolivia.

17:52.723 --> 17:55.639
Okay, but did you know
he still has the doll?

17:55.683 --> 17:57.380
-Churro, the wife? No.
-Oh! Uh-uh. Oh!

17:57.424 --> 17:59.643
I heard he keeps it
somewhere in his office

17:59.687 --> 18:02.255
'cause of like a primordial
bond he has with it.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.996
It does always smell
like cinnamon in there. Oh, no.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.998
Come on. That caveman thing
was like six months ago.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.957
The churros would all be
dried out by now.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.481
He keeps it... refreshed.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.354
-[laughter, overlapping chatter]
-Ew!

18:14.397 --> 18:16.573
You know, we're really not,
like, that different.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.054
I feel like a big part of why
we haven't gotten along is just,

18:19.098 --> 18:20.838
you're asleep when we're awake.

18:20.882 --> 18:23.406
But spending this time together,
it's actually been nice.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.321
Yeah, you guys are all right.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.976
Too bad when the vent opens,
we won't have this anymore.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.631
It would be better if all us
lower deckers stuck together.

18:30.674 --> 18:33.199
I mean, why don't we? We could
all walk through together.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.810
Yeah. Put all our names
into the lottery.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.594
At least it'll make it
an even split.

18:37.638 --> 18:40.423
I like it. Let us lower deckers
have the luck for once.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.121
And then no matter
who gets the rooms,

18:42.164 --> 18:43.774
we come out of it
with new friends.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.168
Delta shift and Beta shift
working together.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.996
-[door buzzes]
-Got it! Quick, quick!

18:48.039 --> 18:49.171
-Nice try, Betas.
-[grunting]

18:49.215 --> 18:51.260
-[laughing]
-Delta shift!

18:51.304 --> 18:53.132
Goddamn you [bleep]
Delta shift pieces of sh...

18:57.832 --> 18:59.268
[shuddering, muttering]

18:59.312 --> 19:01.227
Try-try to do a good thing.
Try...

19:01.270 --> 19:04.186
-Get away from me, dog.
-TOZ: Oh, this is bad.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.580
-Increase puppy levels.
-That's all we've got.

19:06.623 --> 19:09.626
We even tossed in a couple
of bunnies. They had no effect.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.411
Oh, [bleep].

19:12.412 --> 19:14.544
I'm gonna call it.

19:14.588 --> 19:15.719
Somebody get me

19:15.763 --> 19:17.504
-Starfleet Medical on the horn.
-Stop!

19:17.547 --> 19:18.679
[whimpers]

19:18.722 --> 19:20.594
Aw, not you, little guys.
Keep on puppin'.

19:20.637 --> 19:23.466
Haven't you done enough damage?
Get out of here!

19:23.510 --> 19:25.033
Captain, you were right.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.948
-[grunts]
-Letting go of stress is key,

19:26.991 --> 19:29.429
and we finally figured out how.
Bring it in!

19:29.472 --> 19:31.996
Did you dismantle one
of my turbolifts?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.607
We have engineered a machine

19:33.650 --> 19:36.262
that removes stress.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.177
You built this? Ugh.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.875
The whole point of this trip
was to stop working.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.312
We know, Captain,
but it turns out, for us,

19:43.356 --> 19:45.009
there is no greater
stress relief

19:45.053 --> 19:47.664
than engineering a solution
to a problem.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.666
-[chiming]
-No, this is preposterous.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.408
-Ready the captain for transfer.
-RUTHERFORD: Captain, please.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.497
Ten seconds in this pod
will give you the same

19:54.541 --> 19:56.673
therapeutic benefits
of a month spent on the Dove.

19:56.717 --> 20:00.111
Will you try it?
We can't afford to lose you.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.810
Ugh. All right, all right, fine.

20:02.853 --> 20:05.378
Wait, now, how does this work?

20:05.421 --> 20:07.075
-[whirring]
-[groans] Whoa.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.251
Ah. Oh! Aah!

20:09.295 --> 20:11.732
[whirring down]

20:11.775 --> 20:13.777
Captain, how do you feel?

20:13.821 --> 20:16.606
That was... incredible.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.347
Oh, it was better than

20:18.391 --> 20:21.350
a thousand massages combined.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.005
Oh, my God,
I feel like a new woman.

20:24.048 --> 20:26.616
Remarkable. Your levels have
all returned to baseline.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.270
What an amazing device.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.098
With one of these
on every ship,

20:30.141 --> 20:32.187
Starfleet will no longer
even need the Dove.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.625
And you can thank the Cerritos
engineers for that.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.627
Come on, team.
Let's get back to work.

20:37.671 --> 20:40.151
-Yes, work!
-[bleep] yeah!

20:40.195 --> 20:42.328
Oh, yeah. Bye-bye, yeah.

20:42.371 --> 20:44.852
I want this thing ejected
from my ship right now!

20:44.895 --> 20:47.768
-But, it's exactly what we...
-I said get rid of it!

20:47.811 --> 20:49.335
Gah! After everything
we went through,

20:49.378 --> 20:50.901
-stupid Delta shift won.
-MARINER: I can't believe

20:50.945 --> 20:53.034
I laughed
at their caveman Ransom story.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.775
It's probably fake,
just like they are.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.472
Stupid Delta shift
stabbed us in the back

20:56.516 --> 20:59.040
and left us in a puddle
of Minooki water.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.434
Hey, check it out.
It's draining.

21:01.477 --> 21:04.306
Oh, great. I'll put that
fun detail in my personal log,

21:04.350 --> 21:05.786
right after the part
where we got betrayed.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.309
This might bypass the vent.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.790
-Uh, it's not on the map.
-Ah, I don't know.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.574
There could be incinerators
down there.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.097
Huh. Doesn't feel hot.
I guess

21:13.141 --> 21:15.186
it'll take someone bold
to find out.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.927
Boimler, no,
that's a bad idea, man.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.973
-Antigrav Boy!
-No, no, no! Boimler, no!

21:19.016 --> 21:21.149
I'm fine. It was fun.
Come on in.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.194
[sighs]
We really need to do something

21:23.238 --> 21:26.633
about this bold Boimler thing.
It is not sustainable.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.984
-[groans] All right.
-Aah!

21:30.027 --> 21:33.030
-Ooh! That was fun!
-Yeah, and this

21:33.074 --> 21:35.206
goes right up to the terminal.
We're right there.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.599
And no Delta shifters in sight.

21:36.643 --> 21:39.385
Yup, 'cause fortune
favors the bold.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.343
Don't.
Don't, with the bold thing.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.127
[gasps]

21:45.434 --> 21:47.393
TENDI:
I can't believe we did it.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.395
Joke's on them
for leaving us behind.

21:49.438 --> 21:51.048
Now there's no way
we're sharing.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.833
Just gonna make sure our names
are the only ones

21:52.876 --> 21:55.139
on the list,
then lock the Deltas out.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.098
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:57.141 --> 21:59.056
This says there aren't
four rooms on Deck One.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.624
-It's one room on Deck Four.
-Only one?

22:01.668 --> 22:03.800
So wait, so wait.
So who should get it?

22:03.844 --> 22:06.368
It would mean being on a
different deck, all by yourself.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.892
We wouldn't get
to have days like this anymore.

22:08.936 --> 22:11.417
Even with all the peril, it was
really fun just being together.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.070
Yeah, and you know

22:13.114 --> 22:15.203
we're only gonna
be lower deckers for so long.

22:15.246 --> 22:17.379
I mean, in no time Tendi's
gonna be a bridge officer.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.076
I'll probably get drummed
out of Starfleet

22:19.120 --> 22:20.948
for calling Ransom a piece
of [bleep], and, Boimler,

22:20.991 --> 22:23.254
you'll be dead, because
of the whole being bold thing.

22:23.298 --> 22:26.867
If even one of us takes that
room, it'll break us up forever.

22:26.910 --> 22:29.304
And you know
who really deserves that?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.219
ALL:
Delta shift.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.395
Yeah. Let's just walk away and
let them ruin their friendship.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.266
[all laughing]

22:35.310 --> 22:36.833
Beta shifters stick together.

22:36.877 --> 22:40.750
[laughs] Stupid Delta shift.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.709
Yeah, yeah, come check out
the room, everybody.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.493
-Yeah, come on by. It's huge.
-[whoops, laughs]

22:44.537 --> 22:46.756
I can't believe
they're sharing that one room.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.758
God, they just put four beds
in there,

22:48.802 --> 22:50.369
and now it's like
their private party quarters.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.022
Ugh.
Why didn't wethink of that?

22:52.066 --> 22:53.633
I don't know. We were tired.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.635
Hey, why didn't you guys
grab that room for me?

22:55.678 --> 22:57.332
We didn't think
you would want it.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.029
Of course I wanted it.
What are you talking about?

22:59.073 --> 23:00.422
We all wanted it.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.641
'Cause, you know,
Beta shifters stick together.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.207
-We still could have.
-TENDI: Well, we kind of

23:03.251 --> 23:05.384
got caught up in the
all-for-one, one-for-all spirit.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.516
Ugh! That's the definition
of one-for-all.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.388
One room for all of us.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.172
-Hey, hey, relax, man.
-I am relaxed!

23:11.215 --> 23:13.696
I just got back from a spa!
Listen, I heard

23:13.740 --> 23:16.133
that Delta shift is having
a private party tonight,

23:16.177 --> 23:17.265
and we got to get on that list.
[gasps]

23:17.308 --> 23:18.440
We could go back
to the terminal.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.746
OTHER THREE:
No.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.138
-Come on. You said it was fun.
-Not that fun.

23:21.182 --> 23:23.227
Hey, how's it going? Okay.

23:23.271 --> 23:26.970
Computer, 35 churros
in an unmarked paper bag, hot.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.774
[man imitates weapons firing]

24:34.298 --> 24:34.603
Chirp.
