WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:02.512
- All right everyone,
as you know,

00:02.536 --> 00:05.539
the NYPD intends to shutter
one precinct in Brooklyn.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.308
I'll be evaluating
the Nine-Nine

00:07.341 --> 00:10.344
and sending my findings
to the Deputy Commissioner.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.046
Are there any questions?

00:12.080 --> 00:14.548
- Yeah, Veronica, are you
sure you're the best person

00:14.582 --> 00:17.818
for that job, given
our, um, you know...

00:17.851 --> 00:19.820
- Sexual past.
- Thank you, Detective Boyle.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.555
- Sergeant Jeffords,
don't be silly.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.258
I won't let the fact that you
and I have a history together

00:24.292 --> 00:25.535
affect the decision
I have to make

00:25.559 --> 00:27.461
in any way whatsoever.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.738
- Well that's certainly
good to hear.

00:28.762 --> 00:32.266
- I mean, sure, it took me years
of intense therapy to get over

00:32.299 --> 00:34.268
and it's given me
a fear of intimacy

00:34.302 --> 00:37.538
that has affected
every subsequent relationship,

00:37.571 --> 00:41.409
but there's no reason
I can't remain unbiased.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.852
- The way you just said that
makes it seem

00:42.876 --> 00:44.345
like you actually are biased.

00:44.378 --> 00:48.282
I have no idea what you mean.

00:48.316 --> 00:51.152
That is all.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.586
- Okay, the plan is clear.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.156
Sarge, you divorce Sharon,
abandon your children,

00:55.189 --> 00:56.266
get back together
with that monster.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.335
- The precinct is saved.
- I'm not leaving my family.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.959
- Come on!
- You didn't even consider it!

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.913 --> 01:23.417
- Why... won't...
- you print?

01:23.451 --> 01:24.685
Ah, screw this.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.554
- No, no, no, no!
- Not again!

01:26.587 --> 01:28.189
What is going on here?

01:28.222 --> 01:30.158
- Stupid printer won't print out
my stupid resume

01:30.191 --> 01:32.860
which means I can't send it
to any decent stupid precincts

01:32.893 --> 01:34.462
when this stupid place
shuts down.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.263
- That's not gonna happen.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.897
Why are you being
such a Gloomy Gus?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.108
- I'm a Realistic Randy.
- Didn't go with Rosa, huh?

01:38.132 --> 01:40.344
- Ugh, I'm gonna have to meet
a whole new group of people.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.902
I hate people.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.637
Life sucks.
Nothing good ever happens.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.339
- That's not true.
- Come on!

01:45.373 --> 01:46.907
What does Captain Holt
always tell us?

01:46.940 --> 01:49.343
Be a good cop, do your job,
things'll work out.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.212
- Yep, just this morning,
I found this old bag

01:51.245 --> 01:53.547
on the street
and it has a cupcake inside.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.916
- See?
- Scully found a garbage cake.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.352
And I found us...
a dream case.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.488
Involving one
Ms. Cassie Sinclair.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.731
- From "Serve & Protect"?
- Yeah.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.557
- That is my favorite cop show.
- Yeah.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.593
Apparently her laptop was stolen
and it had...

02:05.626 --> 02:07.261
"sensitive materials" on it.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.538
You know what that's code for...

02:08.562 --> 02:09.896
- Bank account numbers.
- Nudies!

02:09.930 --> 02:11.208
One or the other...
I'm not a pervert.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.300
The point is, Gloomy Gus,

02:12.333 --> 02:14.402
- not everything is terrible.
- Maybe you're right.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.512
Maybe life isn't
a miserable, unending,

02:15.536 --> 02:17.571
- maggot-filled pile of crap.
- Yeah, there you go.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.516
Let's go find some nudies
or bank account numbers...

02:19.540 --> 02:20.508
Both would be helpful.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.277
- Guys, we gotta do something
about Veronica.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.478
She's really out to get us.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.690
- We just need to find out
what horrible thing Terry did

02:26.714 --> 02:29.417
to this woman so he can
apologize and make it right.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.761
- I've been wracking my brain.
- I can't think of anything.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.222
- Did you cheat on her?
- No! I would never do that.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.399
- Did you date
one of her friends

02:35.423 --> 02:36.666
- right after you broke up?
- Uh-uh.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.493
I cut off ties with
all our mutual friends.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.263
Even Tommy.
Terry loved Tommy!

02:42.296 --> 02:43.597
Tommy turned Terry on to tennis.

02:43.631 --> 02:44.741
- Well, you did
something to her.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.601
We'll just have to get Veronica
to tell us what it was.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.969
It's time for
a little girl talk.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.514
- You really think
you can handle girl talk?

02:50.538 --> 02:52.506
- Relax. I got this.

02:52.540 --> 02:56.444
Hey Veronica.
It's time for some girl talk.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.613
Let me see that bra!

02:59.647 --> 03:01.282
- Excuse me?

03:01.315 --> 03:03.317
- Didn't work.
- What else we got?

03:03.351 --> 03:06.720
- Hey! Huh?

03:06.754 --> 03:09.623
- Whoa, this is dope.
- Dope it right.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.525
- Welcome to the dream factory.
- Hey, man.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.227
We gotta be cool, all right?

03:13.261 --> 03:15.305
I know you have some fantasy
about being a movie star.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.706
- I don't fantasize
about being a movie star.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.566
I fantasize about meeting one.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.744
And being invited to a party
at George Clooney's villa,

03:20.768 --> 03:24.438
where he pranks me and then
we prank Matt Damon together

03:24.472 --> 03:26.474
and then Damon's like
"Peralta, you got the goods.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.817
You're gonna be the star
of my next movie."

03:27.841 --> 03:29.443
Wait, maybe I do
want to be a movie star.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.444
- Heads up. Here she comes.
- Okay.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.280
- Hey.
- Ms. Sinclair.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.657
I'm Detective Diaz.
This is Detective Peralta.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.649
- Oh, I like the way
you wear your badge.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.518
- Can I steal that?
- Absolutely.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.763
Oh, hey, here's another little
nugget for you, if you'd like.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.456
Thanks
for coming down to the precinct.

03:42.490 --> 03:45.726
Oh, and one more thing...
I'm a cop.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.638
- Wouldn't the person
already know that

03:48.662 --> 03:51.031
- if they were at the precinct?
- No, it works.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.667
- So you had your laptop stolen?
- Yeah, last night.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.337
Someone broke into my trailer,
jimmied the lock.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.047
I found out this morning
from the second A.D.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.740
- Ah, A.D.,
Announcing Department.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.385
- Assistant Director.
- Oh, that's even better.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.411
- Hey, hi, Cassie, who's this?

04:03.444 --> 04:05.613
- Well, this is Peralta
and Diaz, from the NYPD.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.481
- They're here about the laptop.
- Oh.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.750
I didn't think you were gonna
involve the cops in this,

04:09.783 --> 04:11.852
but well, that's okay,
here they are.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.555
I'm Gary Lurmax.
I'm the Executive Producer.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.466
- Your name comes up at the end
of every episode

04:16.490 --> 04:18.826
"Talk to my lawyer!"

04:18.858 --> 04:21.695
- Well, that's actually Walter,
my pet African grey.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.764
- Ah, so cool.
- Anyways, we're real cops.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.433
Should we look
at the crime scene?

04:25.466 --> 04:27.801
- Captain, can we talk?

04:27.835 --> 04:30.638
- Boyle, you know my feelings
about bathroom conversations.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.473
Steadfastly against.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.575
- I know; I just don't want
Veronica to overhear.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.785
I know what she's going through.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.578
I've been broken up with
six times.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.712
- Really? Only six?

04:38.746 --> 04:40.514
- Yep. Oh wait.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.091
Does it count
if they end the relationship

04:42.115 --> 04:43.484
but still want to be friends?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.453
- Yes.
- Oh, then 210.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.320
My point is, I'm worried

04:46.354 --> 04:48.622
that Veronica
will never forgive Terry.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.791
Is there anyone above her
that you can appeal to?

04:50.824 --> 04:52.760
- She reports
to Deputy Commissioner Grayson.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.404
I've already tried
to set up a meeting with him.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.530
He's on vacation
with his family in the Poconos.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.899
- Okay, so maybe we find out
where he's staying

04:58.932 --> 05:01.802
and just happen to run into him
and accidental strike up

05:01.835 --> 05:03.604
a little convo
about the Nine-Nine.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.605
- That seems rather underhanded.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.350
- Desperate times call for
Desperate Housewives.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.651
- What?
- Measures. I said measures.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.577
Frankly, sir,
I know it's not protocol,

05:09.610 --> 05:11.512
but we don't have
any other option.

05:11.545 --> 05:14.382
- Yes. Good point.
- It's not protocol.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.383
But it just might work.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.751
You know, Boyle,
you're a bad influence on me.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.554
- I've never been
a bad influence on anyone!

05:20.588 --> 05:22.423
Should I bring
my leather jacket?

05:22.456 --> 05:24.658
It's ankle-length and fitted.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.428
I won't bring it;
it's too nice.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.363
- Well, I always keep my laptop
in this bag,

05:29.397 --> 05:30.664
but this morning, it was gone.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.434
- Nine times out of ten, in a
case like this, it's a stalker.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.944
Whoever jimmied the lock didn't
know what they were doing.

05:34.968 --> 05:35.903
- I concur.

05:35.936 --> 05:40.774
This was a real hack job.
Hi, Mark Devereaux.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.676
- He plays Detective
Cole Tracker on the show.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.745
- Yeah, he does.
- And if I know Cole Tracker,

05:44.778 --> 05:46.614
the next thing
you're going to say is...

05:46.647 --> 05:48.416
So what's it gonna be:

05:48.449 --> 05:50.451
rock, paper, scissors...

05:50.484 --> 05:51.652
or gun?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.887
- You watch the show.
- I like that.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.590
So get me up to speed.

05:56.624 --> 05:57.867
Who's been in here
since the incident?

05:57.891 --> 05:59.460
- What's he doing?
- Ohh.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.904
I think he must be one
of those actors who has to

06:00.928 --> 06:02.105
stay in character all the time.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.432
I heard Dustin Hoffman did this
on the set of "Tootsie"

06:04.465 --> 06:05.709
- and everyone hated it.
- On, no.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.167
He just thinks he's a detective

06:07.200 --> 06:09.503
because he's been playing one
for 15 years.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.639
- I can hear you.
- Ah, look at that time.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.808
They need you on set, Cassie.
I'll walk you over.

06:14.842 --> 06:18.479
- Ooh, has anyone noticed
this crumb?

06:18.512 --> 06:20.614
Might wanna bag that.
Send it to the boys at the lab.

06:20.648 --> 06:21.782
Well, what have we here?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.751
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Don't touch that.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.752
- Isn't this the case
the laptop was in?

06:24.785 --> 06:27.621
- Yes, but in real life,
when we handle evidence,

06:27.655 --> 06:28.689
we gotta wear gloves.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.190
- I never wear gloves
on the show.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.693
Fans love to see my fingers.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.496
Almost as much as they love
seeing my feet.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.564
Google it.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.731
- Nah.
- Nah.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.833
Check it out.
Devereaux gave me his card

06:39.867 --> 06:41.978
and said, "Call me if you can
think of anything else."

06:42.002 --> 06:43.504
Just like on the show!

06:43.537 --> 06:44.972
- Does he know
we're the real cops?

06:45.005 --> 06:47.641
- I don't think so.
- Hey, guys.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.444
You know, you two have
a really compelling dynamic.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.746
Would you ever consider being
Consulting Producers

06:52.780 --> 06:53.857
- for the show?
- Absolutely!

06:53.881 --> 06:55.949
- What does that mean?
- Well, we pay you to come in

06:55.983 --> 06:57.751
in your off hours,
talk to the writers,

06:57.785 --> 06:58.919
tell them your stories,

06:58.952 --> 07:00.588
lend the show
a little authenticity.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.198
- Wow, I can't believe I've been
talking to people for free

07:02.222 --> 07:03.524
all these years like an idiot!

07:03.557 --> 07:04.801
- Great.
- I'll run it by the studio.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.794
- He's gonna run it
by the studio, Rosa.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.705
I told you, if we're good cops,
you do your job,

07:08.729 --> 07:09.806
things will work out
and they do.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.532
- I don't know, man.
- Something's weird.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.677
I think the job offer is bogus.
He's trying to buy us off.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.779
- Look, I don't know about you,
but I can't be bought off.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.981
And it's gonna take a hell of
a lot more than some job offer

07:18.005 --> 07:20.207
to make me compromise
the integrity of the badge.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.610
- Hey, Jake, catering send over
some chicken fingers.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.677
- Oh!

07:26.714 --> 07:27.948
- What is wrong with you?

07:27.981 --> 07:29.926
We're working a case we'll
definitely gonna solve,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.127
we're hanging out
with cool people,

07:31.151 --> 07:33.020
Don't ruin this with
all your Rosa-ness.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.054
- Think about it.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.264
That producer guy
didn't want us here at all.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.525
And then after watching us work
for, like, two seconds,

07:37.558 --> 07:39.827
he offers us a job?
It doesn't make sense.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.162
- That's just how
show biz works, you rube!

07:42.195 --> 07:43.731
- Listen to yourself.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.808
You're letting all of this
cloud your judgment.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.109
- I love clouds; they keep
the sun away on hot days.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.711
- He doesn't want us
to solve this crime,

07:47.735 --> 07:49.737
so he's buying us off.
It's shady.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.715
- I love the shade; it keeps
the sun away on hot days.

07:51.739 --> 07:52.906
Besides, he's a rich guy...

07:52.940 --> 07:54.183
What's his motive
for stealing a laptop?

07:54.207 --> 07:57.244
- Leverage. He and Cassie have
been fighting over her contract.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.179
- It's been all over the news.
- The trades.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.848
They call them
"the trades" here.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.751
We read those in our trailers
after we wrap

08:03.784 --> 08:05.719
and before we go home.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.921
Stars use the word "home" too.

08:07.955 --> 08:10.057
- They're just like us.
- That job offer wasn't real.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.160
- None of this is real.
- Yes, it is!

08:13.193 --> 08:14.261
All right?

08:14.294 --> 08:18.031
I know Hollywood
and I know what's real!

08:18.065 --> 08:20.868
For example, this door is fake.
Not a real door.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.903
It's a "doorn't."
As in "doorn't open this."

08:22.936 --> 08:25.072
And doorn't ruin my dreams!

08:25.105 --> 08:26.006
- Okay, Sarge, we just want

08:26.039 --> 08:28.275
to walk through your breakup
step by step.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.153
That doesn't mean we think
you did anything wrong.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.880
Start talking, butthead!

08:32.913 --> 08:36.183
- I didn't do anything!
- I respect women. I'm a feminist.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.184
I believe women should be
on all the money.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.188
I wanna pay for a sandwich
with a $10 Ellen DeGeneres.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.024
- Maybe you hurt Veronica's
feelings without meaning to?

08:44.057 --> 08:46.193
- Nope.
- I planned the perfect breakup.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.829
We got dinner
at a mid-range restaurant...

08:48.862 --> 08:50.130
Nice enough to show I care,

08:50.163 --> 08:52.833
but not so nice she thought
a proposal was coming.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.902
I even got her
a classy breakup present,

08:54.935 --> 08:57.304
plus a gift receipt, in case
she wanted to exchange it.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.107
And I said just the right words.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.909
You deserve the world.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.011
You deserve someone
that can make you happy

09:04.044 --> 09:06.780
and it is the greatest
displeasure of my life

09:06.814 --> 09:08.882
that I cannot be that man.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.784
- Thank you, Terrence.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.856
- I'm not saying you're lying,
Mr. Jeffers,

09:15.889 --> 09:17.791
but if that's how things
went down,

09:17.825 --> 09:20.794
why is Veronica so angry,
you stupid liar?

09:20.828 --> 09:22.262
- I don't know!
- You don't know.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.931
Well, we could stay here
all night

09:23.964 --> 09:25.341
until your story starts
making sense.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.934
- I want to
figure this out, too,

09:26.967 --> 09:27.935
but I have to go home
eventually.

09:27.968 --> 09:31.004
- You think anyone cares
about your damned plans?

09:31.038 --> 09:33.140
I know I don't.
Do you care, Amy?

09:33.173 --> 09:35.375
- No, I don't.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.278
- Okay, so remember, this is
Deputy Commissioner Grayson

09:38.311 --> 09:40.013
and his smoking hot wife.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.224
You'll recognize her
because she looks

09:41.248 --> 09:42.950
like an older Patti LuPone.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.861
- And you're sure this is
the floor they're staying on?

09:44.885 --> 09:47.855
- Yes, I called his secretary
and pretended to be his mother.

09:47.888 --> 09:51.258
Or, should I say,
"The Lady Grayson."

09:51.291 --> 09:52.860
- Very sly.
- It's a little trick

09:52.893 --> 09:54.995
I picked up from
the original bad boy...

09:55.028 --> 09:56.363
a Mr. Bugs Bunny.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.866
- Commissioner Grayson,
is that you?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.634
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

10:00.668 --> 10:02.111
- Raymond Holt.
- Captain of the Nine-Nine.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.072
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm on vacation. You?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.139
- Vacation.
- Vacation.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.274
- Vacation.
- Vacation.

10:07.307 --> 10:11.044
- While we're on
the subject of things...

10:11.078 --> 10:12.255
are you by any chance in charge

10:12.279 --> 10:13.690
of the Brooklyn precinct
contraction?

10:13.714 --> 10:15.082
- I don't want
to talk about that.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.284
If you have an issue,
bring it up with your auditor.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.120
- Well our auditor is actually...
- Listen, fellas.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.991
If you think you're helping your
precinct's cause, you're not.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.159
- Hey, sexy.
- You ready to go?

10:26.193 --> 10:29.663
- Oh, that's my goddaughter.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.098
- What?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.000
- So Grayson's a philanderer.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.410
What's that gotta do
with the price of onions?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.704
- I don't know, sir.
- This could be an opportunity.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.206
I mean, WWBD, right?

10:39.239 --> 10:40.207
What Would Bugs Do?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.109
- Good question.
- What would Bugs do?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.111
- Bugs would blackmail Grayson.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.014
- Then I, sir, am no Bugs.

10:47.047 --> 10:47.948
I won't break the law.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.050
- I'm not saying blackmail him
blackmail him.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.152
We just insinuate
that we know what's going on

10:52.185 --> 10:54.221
and let him fill in the blanks.

10:54.254 --> 10:58.125
- Oh, so it's like...
- he blackmails himself?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.893
- Uh-huh, you just go up
to him and say,

10:59.927 --> 11:03.030
"Commissioner Grayson,
how's your... wife?"

11:03.063 --> 11:04.273
- Commissioner Grayson,
how's your wife?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.309
- No, that just sounds like you
really wanna know how she is.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.336
Insinuate... maybe add a pause
before "wife."

11:09.369 --> 11:12.105
- Commissioner Grayson,
how's your...

11:15.075 --> 11:16.043
wife?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.177
- Too long.
- Fouled hit.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.355
- Ugh, this is not my strong suit.
- No, no, sir, sir, sir.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.348
You're doing great.
Just forget the pause.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.383
Use your eyebrows...
Like this.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.353
How's your...
"pump, pump, pump" wife.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.321
- How's your...
- pump, pump, pump wife.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.390
- Eh, it was a little bit better
in my head.

11:30.423 --> 11:34.194
Try this. How's your...
"pump" wife "pump, pump."

11:34.227 --> 11:35.462
- End on a double pump?

11:35.495 --> 11:37.130
That's risky.
He'll see right through me.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.265
How about...

11:38.298 --> 11:41.468
"Pump, pump"
how's your..."pump"?

11:41.501 --> 11:43.403
- You forgot to say wife.
- Ah, good note.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.371
- How 'bout this?

11:44.404 --> 11:49.142
How's your..."pump" wife
"pump" Grayson "pump"?

11:49.176 --> 11:50.410
- That's the one.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.013
- I really don't think anyone
in the crew would've done it.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.247
We're like a family.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.492
- Yes, and as someone who's
about to marry into that family,

11:56.516 --> 11:58.485
so to speak, I tend
to agree with you, Sarah.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.229
It seems highly unlikely
anyone from the crew

12:00.253 --> 12:02.122
or producers would be involved.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.091
- Hey, Sarah, what's the status

12:04.124 --> 12:06.093
on the toilet seat heater
for my trailer?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.503
It's day four of cold
butt cheeks going on over here.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.496
- I'm sorry, but this
is official police business.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.499
- Putting the screws to her?
- I got this.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.104
Sarah. You're a P.A.
What do you make a year?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.481
Two, three hundred
thousand dollars?

12:18.505 --> 12:19.539
- 30.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.984
- 30 hundred thousand dollars
a year?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.776
- 30 thousand.
- Oh. Ooh.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.545
And yet Cassie Sinclair
pulls down millions

12:25.578 --> 12:26.479
sitting on her butt

12:26.513 --> 12:28.315
while you bust your hump
running her errands.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.983
I bet that makes you angry,

12:30.017 --> 12:32.252
angry enough
to steal her laptop?

12:32.285 --> 12:33.386
My gut says yes.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.123
- Okay, that's enough.
- You're right.

12:36.156 --> 12:36.924
She's not gonna talk.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.526
Sometimes I wonder
why I do this job.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.995
- You don't.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.798
Okay, what about the
Executive Producer, Gary Lurmax?

12:44.832 --> 12:46.342
Do you know where he was
on the night of the robbery?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.535
- He's normally in his office
after wrap.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.838
Although, last night he did
ask me to tell him

12:50.871 --> 12:52.139
when Cassie left her trailer.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.307
- Hm, interesting.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.077
- Or completely useless.
- No way to know for sure.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.147
Sarah, one more question.
Those donuts, are they...

13:00.180 --> 13:01.424
- They're all free.
- Okay, great.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.459
- Yeah, I wanted to make sure
Cassie was out of her trailer

13:03.483 --> 13:04.818
because we were running behind,

13:04.852 --> 13:06.286
and we needed to make our day.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.159
- Is that normally
an Executive Producer's job?

13:08.188 --> 13:09.465
- Well, I'm trying
to be more hands on...

13:09.489 --> 13:11.859
- Network pressure, overages.
- Overages, sure.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.293
I get those on my cell phone.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.295
- You know, it's been great
watching you work.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.605
Could I introduce you
to the writers?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.531
It'd just take
a couple of minutes, tops.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.433
They're very awkward.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.135
They can't talk
much longer than that.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.370
- Lead the way, hombre.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.371
Hey, if you name
a character after me,

13:24.404 --> 13:27.174
- that could be his catch phrase.
- I love that.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.242
- Thank you, Gare Bear.
- I'll go grab 'em.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.179
- Great.
- Hey, man.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.381
Focus up.
We have a case to work.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.558
- That's why we gotta
meet the writers.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.592
I mean, one of them
probably did it.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.051
You heard Gary...
They're awkward.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.195
They're probably all perverts.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.187
- Jake, wake up.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.255
You're being manipulated
by our prime suspect.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.324
- He's not our prime suspect,
all right?

13:44.357 --> 13:47.394
He's subprime at best.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.296
Subprime mortgage crisis
reference.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.597
The point is,

13:50.630 --> 13:52.341
you just have to
think the worst of everyone

13:52.365 --> 13:53.910
because that's how you see life.
It's sad.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.602
- You're sad
and you're being a bad cop.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.413
- All right, I know you're just
trying to hurt my feelings,

13:57.437 --> 13:59.339
but I'm in such a good mood
about all of this

13:59.372 --> 14:00.616
that there's literally
nothing you can say

14:00.640 --> 14:01.674
that'll bring me down.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.177
- "Lead the way, hombre"
is a terrible catchphrase.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.916
Nice try trying to hurt
my feelings 'cause you didn't.

14:13.686 --> 14:17.157
- Looks like they left
housekeeping one hell of a tip.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.659
A finger tip.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.162
And that's how I would lift up
a bloody finger with my pen.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.897
- That is great.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.933
Oh, in this episode,
the perp is a cannibal.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.467
Should I aim
away from his stomach

14:27.500 --> 14:28.677
so I don't taint the evidence?

14:28.701 --> 14:29.602
- Yeah, that's definitely

14:29.636 --> 14:31.972
how I take down a cannibal
when I do it.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.573
- Right.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.407
- What are you doing?

14:34.441 --> 14:36.043
- Talking to Cassie
and the writers,

14:36.076 --> 14:37.644
who, b-t-dubs,
all have alibis.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.180
Also, Gary said that the studio
approved us as producers.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.649
I'm having my agent
look over the paperwork.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.184
Okay, fine,
I don't have an agent.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.694
I'm using
my parents' divorce attorney.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.187
He's my uncle.
He was disbarred.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.156
- Well, while you were
off in fantasy land,

14:49.189 --> 14:51.024
I solved the case.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.227
- Wait a minute, Rosa!

14:54.261 --> 14:56.039
- Security camera
across from Cassie's trailer

14:56.063 --> 14:58.966
- caught this yesterday.
- Gare Bear took the laptop?

14:58.999 --> 15:02.069
Come on. No one could've
seen this coming.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.172
Except for you.
You saw it coming, obviously.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.475
- Hey there, bud.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.944
We've been going for a while...
You feeling hungry?

15:10.978 --> 15:13.713
- Starving, thanks.
- Oh, come on!

15:13.746 --> 15:16.083
- You get a yogurt
when I get the truth.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.717
- Oh God, it's in the grout.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.219
It's gonna smell in here
forever.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.321
- I told you,
I did everything right.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.191
I even gave Veronica plenty
of time after her mom's death.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.625
- Wait, what does that mean?

15:25.658 --> 15:28.228
- I was gonna break up with her,
but then her mom passed,

15:28.261 --> 15:31.098
so, like a gentleman, I waited.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.308
That way she wouldn't
have to deal with

15:32.332 --> 15:33.733
too much pain all at once.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.502
- How long did you wait,
Jeffords?

15:35.535 --> 15:37.204
- I don't know, a year,
year and a half.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.305
- Sarge!
- Seriously?

15:38.338 --> 15:40.640
- What?
- I was being considerate.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.576
Believe me, she had her fun
for those 18 months.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.045
- Terry puts out.
- All right.

15:45.078 --> 15:48.048
- Also, there's no way
she even knows I waited.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.525
- The gift you bought her,
did you buy it

15:49.549 --> 15:51.160
when you first wanted
to break up with her

15:51.184 --> 15:52.519
or when you finally did it?

15:52.552 --> 15:56.056
- The first time!
- But why would that matter...

15:57.757 --> 15:58.992
The gift receipt.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.627
- They all break eventually.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.163
Get him out of my sight.

16:03.196 --> 16:07.267
- Ah, Commissioner Grayson.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.637
- Captain Holt, I told you,
I'm not going to get involved.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.072
- I know.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.141
I just wanted to say...
to you...

16:14.174 --> 16:17.144
- What's wrong with your face?
- Do I need to call a doctor?

16:17.177 --> 16:19.079
- No, I'm clearly trying
to communicate...

16:19.112 --> 16:21.548
- Captain! There you are.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.284
- We have an... emergency.
- I'm taking care of it.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.785
- Okay, I don't know
what this is.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.188
But I'm going to leave.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.290
Why did you stop me?

16:30.323 --> 16:32.025
- I was making progress.
- I know, sir.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.693
But I have to say something.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.696
I love the Nine-Nine.
And the main reason why is you.

16:36.729 --> 16:37.797
- Not Jake.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.874
- Yes, clearly,
it's mostly Jake.

16:38.898 --> 16:42.069
But it's also you
and the standard that you've set

16:42.102 --> 16:44.204
for us with
your unwavering morals.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.705
I'd rather we split up

16:45.738 --> 16:49.242
than stay together
and compromise who we are.

16:49.276 --> 16:52.045
- Well, thank you, Boyle.
- You're right.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.214
No matter what happens,
we'll feel better knowing

16:54.247 --> 16:56.183
we didn't resort to blackmail.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.185
- I agree.
- From now on,

16:58.218 --> 17:02.089
the only black male I want
anything to do with is you.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.157
- That was incredibly
inappropriate.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.269
- I know, but
I had thought of it

17:06.292 --> 17:08.261
and I was so proud,
I just had to say it out loud.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.695
- Let's just go.
- Great.

17:11.397 --> 17:12.741
- What's going on?
- You can't just come in here.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.267
- We have a warrant.
- Boom!

17:14.300 --> 17:16.269
And that's a real one,
not a prop.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.742
Or have you forgotten
the difference?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.339
- Even when it comes to people?
- What?

17:19.372 --> 17:22.209
- "People" is me.
- You used me like a prop.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.852
I thought it was pretty clear.
Rosa got it.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.079
- Nope.
- Detectives, you don't know

17:26.113 --> 17:27.214
what you're talking about.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.815
- Found it.
- Oh, look at that.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.818
Security cam caught you
breaking into Cassie's trailer

17:31.851 --> 17:32.895
and walking off
with this backpack.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.288
You know what, you Hollywood
types make me sick.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.289
- Detective...
- For the record,

17:36.323 --> 17:38.091
your show stinks.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.203
I've watched over 200 episode
of it and I've never liked one.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.395
- Open the bag, Detective.
- Happy to.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.097
I can't wait to see
the look on your face

17:44.131 --> 17:47.700
when I pull out Cassie's compu...
Just a bunch of pills.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.802
- Cassie has
a painkiller problem.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.771
The show tries
to protect her from herself.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.673
That's why I was surprised
she called the cops,

17:53.706 --> 17:55.342
but thanks for busting in here

17:55.375 --> 17:58.778
and telling me
how much you hate my show.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.747
- And scene.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.116
That was a great example
of a cop making a mistake.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.193
That's the kind of thing
we can go over more

18:04.217 --> 18:05.828
when I come in on Monday
for my first day of work.

18:05.852 --> 18:06.962
- No, you can forget
about the job.

18:06.986 --> 18:09.289
- But you're still gonna name
a character after me?

18:11.324 --> 18:13.326
- Well, I think
we figured out her size:

18:13.360 --> 18:18.298
34 Double Dead.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.499
- You all right, man?
- No.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.369
Could have been Detective
Peralta saying that perfect pun.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.337
- I'm sorry the consulting job
didn't work out.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.614
Do you wanna head back
and do some more interviews?

18:25.638 --> 18:26.749
- What's the point?
- You were right.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.840
Everything sucks.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.309
We're never gonna solve
the case,

18:29.342 --> 18:30.419
I'll never work
in show business,

18:30.443 --> 18:31.344
and I'll never drink
another smoothie.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.480
- Now you're getting it.
- Everything is awful.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.723
Our precinct is getting
shut down

18:34.747 --> 18:36.416
and we're never gonna
work together again.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.494
- I'll end up living in a car
with a dog I can't feed

18:38.518 --> 18:40.653
playing sad songs on a harmonica
I can't afford.

18:40.687 --> 18:41.797
- Never gonna
see each other again.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.766
- The harmonica will get
repossessed, I'll be all alone

18:43.790 --> 18:45.858
with my hungry dog
and harmonica-less silence.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.760
- And we won't be friends
anymore.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.496
- Wait, what?

18:49.529 --> 18:51.740
You don't actually think that
we won't be friends anymore

18:51.764 --> 18:53.733
if the precinct gets shut down?

18:53.766 --> 18:58.805
Rosa, we will never
not be friends.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.642
- Thanks, man.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.843
- Get your hand off me.
- Yep.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.745
Forgot the Rosa rule.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.547
No touchy.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.550
Oh, my God.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.352
I just solved the case.

19:12.385 --> 19:15.722
Season 8, episode 16, in which
Detective Cole Tracker

19:15.755 --> 19:17.790
catches
the Brooklyn Bra Butcher.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.659
While wearing gloves.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.794
- But Detective Peralta,
I thought Mark said

19:21.828 --> 19:23.796
his character never wears gloves
on the show.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.633
- Oh, now that you mention it,
that does ring a bell.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.802
- That's my move.
- Oh, I'm aware.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.338
You told us
you never wore gloves

19:31.371 --> 19:34.341
when you picked up
Cassie's laptop bag.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.675
- A double Tracker.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.377
- You wanted us
to see you holding the bag

19:37.410 --> 19:38.621
because your prints
were already on it.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.822
From when you stole the laptop.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.581
- Cassie's only been on the show
two years,

19:41.614 --> 19:43.650
but there's already talk
of her getting a spin-off.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.285
You were gonna post
her personal photos

19:45.318 --> 19:46.919
- and humiliate her.
- Ridiculous.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.522
I've never been more insulted
in my life.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.424
Your theory is outrageous.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.560
And what's more,
it's just a theory.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.595
I don't know how cops
around here do things,

19:55.628 --> 19:57.397
but where I come from,
we're burdened

19:57.430 --> 19:58.907
with a little thing
we like to call evidence,

19:58.931 --> 20:03.336
of which you don't have a shred.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.505
- We found Cassie's laptop
in the trunk of your car.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.849
- I stand correct.
- Yeah, you got me.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.441
I did it. Good job.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.779
- Terrence.
- Veronica.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.515
I'm sorry for how I handled
our breakup back in the day.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.851
I was trying to be a good guy,
to be nice.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.821
But sometimes,
to be nice to someone,

20:21.854 --> 20:24.591
it means you have to be
honest with them,

20:24.624 --> 20:26.526
even if it hurts their feelings.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.961
- Thank you for saying that.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.663
- Now you don't have to
forgive me,

20:30.697 --> 20:33.633
but could you please at least
give the precinct a shot?

20:33.666 --> 20:37.504
- I would love to do that.
- Thank you so much!

20:37.537 --> 20:39.706
- Except I've already
turned in my report.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.609
- Was it... positive?

20:42.642 --> 20:43.743
- No.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.679
It was real bad.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.421
- I made this saddle
out of your sister.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.764
And now I'm going to put it
on your back.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.524
And your sister and I are
gonna trot you

20:57.557 --> 20:59.392
all around the apartment.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.460
- What's wrong with you?

21:00.493 --> 21:04.397
- I'm Jake Peralta, the grossest
pervert of all time.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.665
- Hi-ya! NYPD!

21:05.698 --> 21:07.900
You're under arrest,
you unbelievable creep!

21:07.934 --> 21:09.636
- You'll never take me alive!

21:18.845 --> 21:21.013
- Rot in hell, Jake Peralta.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.684
- They used my name!

21:26.686 --> 21:28.421
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
