WEBVTT

00:50.759 --> 00:51.844
Race you there.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.058
Mommy, how far does it go?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.476
Forever.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.821
Gloria.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.490
Gloria.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.496
No.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.208
No.

01:24.793 --> 01:29.548
I have to go back.

01:33.552 --> 01:34.428
One sec.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.388
Where--

01:37.681 --> 01:39.433
Where's the water?

01:39.516 --> 01:41.351
It's right here.

01:43.729 --> 01:44.980
You missed a dose.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.733
That's all.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.656
I have to find them.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.451
It's okay.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.453
You're okay.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.843
She's taking it with her.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.846
Should we send someone?

03:44.641 --> 03:46.226
No. Leave it.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.020
Are you sure?

03:49.313 --> 03:50.522
Keep following her.

05:58.567 --> 05:59.610
Morning.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.322
How's the baby?

06:06.450 --> 06:07.534
She's good.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.043
You've got messages.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.878
First one's an apology from maintenance.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.004
For what?

06:19.505 --> 06:22.299
It says they broke your vase,
and they've taken it to be repaired.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.136
Why were they there in the first place?

06:26.220 --> 06:27.930
I don't know how things are
in the Down Deep,

06:28.013 --> 06:30.724
but up here we learn early not to question
the workings of maintenance

06:30.807 --> 06:32.309
unless you want your toilet
to stop working.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.394
Down in Mechanical,
we fix things ourselves.

06:34.478 --> 06:35.562
I'm heading out for a bit.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.606
And you're not gonna tell me
where you're going.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.359
Something I need to take care of
in the Mids.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.321
There's another message.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.449
"Mayor Holland requests meeting
with Sheriff Nichols first thing this a.m.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.867
Please acknowledge receipt."

06:48.951 --> 06:51.787
-Well, acknowledge it.
-So, I should tell him you're on your way.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.872
Tell him I'll have to reschedule.

06:53.956 --> 06:56.166
You're gonna brush off the mayor
a day after the holiday

06:56.250 --> 06:57.835
with the whole Silo still on edge.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.294
I'm not worried about the mayor,

06:59.378 --> 07:01.713
just like I'm not worried about
leaving you in charge for a few hours.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.342
Karins for Billings. Do you copy?

07:06.385 --> 07:07.553
You should get that.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.268
Billings.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.955
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, I'm looking for Gloria Hildebrandt.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.373
-She here?
-I'm sorry.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.458
I'm not authorized
to give out that information.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.793
You're-- Why not?

07:41.044 --> 07:43.005
-Like I said, I'm not authorized.
-Authorized. Right.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.840
Do you see this? This--

07:46.300 --> 07:47.676
Wait, hold on.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.680
This makes me authorized to know, right?

07:51.763 --> 07:55.142
-So, is she here or not?
-She is, Sheriff.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.227
Great. I want to ask her some questions.

07:57.728 --> 08:00.772
I'll take you back,
but you should be prepared.

08:00.856 --> 08:01.857
For what?

08:03.192 --> 08:05.485
You might not get
the answers you're hoping for.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.410
Gloria, you have a visitor.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.747
Gloria, I'm Sheriff Nichols.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.498
I found them.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.877
She suffers from hallucinations.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.671
They're a symptom of her condition.
Advanced vascular dementia.

08:24.755 --> 08:28.509
Right where I left them by the water.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.638
What water?

08:32.721 --> 08:34.681
It's best not to disturb her.

08:41.647 --> 08:45.025
The water they don't want us
to know about.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.487
She gets agitated,
says things that make no sense.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.239
-Wait.
-We keep her as comfortable as possible.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.865
I wanna take her for a walk.

08:51.949 --> 08:55.118
Gloria, would you like that?
Would you like to go for a walk with me?

08:55.202 --> 08:57.538
No, that's not possible.
She's not cleared to leave the ward.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.748
-I will clear it, okay?
-You can't.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.708
-There's an order to keep her here.
-By who?

09:01.792 --> 09:02.918
Judge Meadows.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.925
If there's nothing else,
I think you should leave.

09:24.106 --> 09:26.316
Excuse me, Deputy.
I'd like to report a crime.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.235
My husband forgot his lunch this morning.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.112
I'll make sure he's apprehended, ma'am.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.578
Oh, my God.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.662
Oh, shit.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.497
Hey.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.999
-How are you feeling?
-Better.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.667
You didn't have to come all the way
up here.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.003
I wanted to show off
how important her daddy is.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.506
-Guess she's not too impressed.
-As long as she's not crying.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.969
Was hoping to meet the sheriff.
Where is she?

09:54.052 --> 09:55.804
Yeah. Your guess is as good as mine.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.806
Forget it.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.892
I could use a break. You want a coffee?

10:00.601 --> 10:01.643
Always.

10:01.727 --> 10:02.895
Come on.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.647
I'll be in the cafeteria if you need me.

10:06.565 --> 10:07.733
I need the sheriff.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.109
-She's not here.
-It's an emergency.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.950
Billings to sheriff.
Do you copy? Billings to sheriff…

10:21.663 --> 10:24.499
Ma'am.

10:25.501 --> 10:26.877
Ma'am, I told you.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.546
-I told you she's not in.
-Where is she then?

10:30.130 --> 10:33.550
Like I said, if you want to see the judge,
you request an appointment.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.219
I don't need one. I'm the sheriff.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.096
An appointment is part
of the protocol that comes--

10:38.180 --> 10:39.848
I don't give a shit about protocol.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.559
Okay, if she's not here, I'll wait.

10:42.643 --> 10:45.521
-You'd be wasting your time.
-That's not your problem, is it?

10:47.898 --> 10:49.316
She's out sick with a cold.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.735
When will she be back?

10:52.444 --> 10:53.737
When she's feeling better.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.699
All deputies report to 26. All de--

10:57.783 --> 10:58.700
Sorry.

10:58.784 --> 10:59.618
They're outta control.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.119
-We're handling it.
-Like hell you are.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.997
Sheriff Nichols,
if you hear me, come to 26 now.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.332
Damn it.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.960
Sorry. Excuse me.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.796
Sheriff's department. Out of the way.
Move, move. Sheriff's department.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.469
-Where the hell is the sheriff?
-I don't know.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.471
Hey, excuse me. Sheriff's department.

11:19.555 --> 11:22.224
-Sheriff's department. Excuse me.
-Get out of the way. Coming through.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.685
I'm trying to pass-- I'm trying
to pass you. Sheriff's department.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.771
Sheriff's department.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.231
Hey! Sheriff's department.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.058
-What's going on?
-There you are.

12:05.142 --> 12:06.476
-Where have you been?
-What's happening?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.687
If you hadn't turned off your radio,
you wouldn't have to ask.

12:08.770 --> 12:09.771
Shit. I--

12:14.943 --> 12:17.654
-The bar on 26 was trashed last night.
-By who?

12:17.738 --> 12:19.448
The owner says a group
from the lower Mids.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.909
They got too rowdy last night.
He cut 'em off.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.494
When he showed up this morning,
he jumped to his own conclusions.

12:24.578 --> 12:28.665
By the time we got there, the entire floor
was ready to tear each other apart.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.586
The people are scared and they're angry,
and they need their sheriff.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.505
-Billings.
-I'm not done.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.673
In addition
to getting an elbow to the face,

12:36.757 --> 12:40.260
I had to cover for you when the mayor
turned up asking why you never showed.

12:40.344 --> 12:41.553
I lied for you.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.847
-Okay. I'm sorry.
-We're past that.

12:44.515 --> 12:46.433
You have to come clean right now.

12:47.351 --> 12:51.772
I want a reason why you are neglecting
your duties and dishonoring that badge.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.191
-Otherwise, I have no choice--
-George Wilkins was murdered.

12:54.942 --> 12:55.943
What?

12:57.736 --> 13:00.489
Just like Jahns and Marnes and Trumbull.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.283
Trumbull?
You told Judge Meadows he jumped.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.452
Yeah,
'cause that is what she wanted to hear.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.289
You want me to be honest with you?

13:11.124 --> 13:14.294
I have no idea what I'm doing. Okay?

13:14.378 --> 13:16.004
I came up here 'cause of George,

13:16.088 --> 13:19.424
and the only thing I figured out is
that the man that I love…

13:20.843 --> 13:23.053
He lied and he used me,

13:23.136 --> 13:25.222
and I just still want to find out
why he got killed.

13:26.014 --> 13:29.059
And now that somehow is connected
to Jahns, to Marnes,

13:29.142 --> 13:32.312
to why Holston went out
and to why his wife before that went out.

13:32.396 --> 13:33.939
So you're asking me to look the other way

13:34.022 --> 13:37.526
as you pull on a thread that's connected
to four murders and two cleanings?

13:37.609 --> 13:38.443
Yes.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.373
George Wilkins's case was closed.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.083
That is…

13:54.334 --> 13:57.129
until we found one of his relics
in Trumbull's apartment,

13:57.212 --> 14:00.382
which is related
to our larger relics investigation.

14:00.465 --> 14:07.139
So, technically it can be seen
as an opening to reexamine George's case.

14:10.184 --> 14:11.518
Thank you.

14:11.602 --> 14:12.936
Thank the Pact.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.148
And just promise you'll see the mayor?

14:16.231 --> 14:18.692
I'll see the mayor. First thing tomorrow.

14:23.197 --> 14:26.491
You should go home. You look like crap.

14:30.454 --> 14:31.496
One more thing.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.833
Do you know where Meadows lives?

14:36.877 --> 14:39.171
I'd ask why, but something tells me

14:39.254 --> 14:41.840
this is one of those moments
I'm supposed to look the other way.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.679
Level 15. Manager's Row.

14:48.514 --> 14:52.017
If you want to get in her good graces,
she has breakfast delivered every morning.

14:53.477 --> 14:54.978
She likes bacon and eggs.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.627
I was on my way
when I saw your lights in the sky.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.420
They're gone now.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.675
They're not gone. They're just hiding.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.594
You're not a fan of mushrooms, I take it?

15:30.264 --> 15:33.225
Just 'cause we live underground
doesn't mean we have to eat fungus.

15:34.226 --> 15:35.894
I think they're pretty good, actually.

15:36.854 --> 15:39.356
Well, guess we could agree to disagree.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.193
What do you do when you're not here?

15:44.695 --> 15:46.780
I'm a systems analyst.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.366
You work in IT?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.244
And whatever
computer problems you're having,

15:52.327 --> 15:54.538
I promise that they are not my fault, so…

15:55.372 --> 15:58.834
So you knew Mayor Holland
before he became mayor?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.422
"Know" is a bit of a stretch, you know?

16:03.505 --> 16:05.799
He once lectured me

16:05.883 --> 16:09.428
on the proper protocol for unplugging
a toaster in the break room, and so…

16:09.511 --> 16:10.888
Yep, that sounds like him.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.974
-There. Look.
-Where?

16:14.057 --> 16:15.225
See?

16:17.519 --> 16:22.191
I think that is here,

16:23.233 --> 16:28.155
which means there should be
another one there.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.869
Wonder how long they've been there…

16:36.496 --> 16:38.624
like, if they've always been there--
Even before,

16:38.707 --> 16:40.459
when people used to live outside.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.296
Wondered the same thing.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.717
Have you ever noticed anything strange,
besides the lights in the sky?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.512
-What do you mean?
-Like a clue

16:52.179 --> 16:53.805
to what it was really like out there?

16:59.144 --> 17:01.480
No, but--

17:02.606 --> 17:07.778
Well, there was this one time that

17:08.444 --> 17:13.992
I saw a light move across the sky
and then disappear.

17:26.505 --> 17:28.006
-Hey, I'm sorry.
-Enough, wait--

17:29.216 --> 17:31.009
I thought that
because of what I said yesterday

17:31.093 --> 17:32.928
-about wanting to--
-It's okay. I shouldn't have--

17:33.887 --> 17:34.972
I'm gonna go.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.434
No, it's okay. I've got it.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.985
We have a problem.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.695
Okay.

19:14.488 --> 19:15.697
I've received a threat.

19:15.781 --> 19:17.574
-What?
-No, it's not--

19:17.658 --> 19:19.618
No, I'm gonna get you a security detail.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.745
Sheriff, I know it's not your inclination,

19:21.828 --> 19:24.998
but I need you to listen.

19:27.584 --> 19:28.627
Have a seat.

19:31.380 --> 19:35.759
The other day, after Sims accused you
of planting evidence,

19:35.843 --> 19:39.012
I was informed
that Judge Meadows was not pleased

19:39.096 --> 19:41.265
with my intervention on your behalf.

19:41.890 --> 19:47.813
She sent Sims with a warning that
if I were to obstruct her efforts again,

19:48.480 --> 19:53.610
she would use some contortion of the Pact
to remove me.

19:55.320 --> 20:01.493
Years ago, I made a choice
to stay out of her way.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.328
To protect your job.

20:03.412 --> 20:04.663
Of course.

20:04.746 --> 20:09.585
But my job in IT isn't any job.

20:11.044 --> 20:15.048
I know you think it's the generator
that keeps the Silo running--

20:15.132 --> 20:17.467
'Cause it is.
'Cause without power, we have nothing.

20:17.551 --> 20:20.053
It's how the power is used.

20:20.846 --> 20:25.893
To water crops,
transmit messages, to circulate air.

20:25.976 --> 20:30.814
All of these invisible functions
are controlled by the servers in IT.

20:31.815 --> 20:36.862
Now, if the servers were to fall into
the hands of the wrong person,

20:38.322 --> 20:41.366
no amount of power
from the generator would matter.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.119
Do you think Meadows would hijack
the servers?

20:44.203 --> 20:47.706
I know I don't want to wait around
to find out.

20:48.916 --> 20:53.795
We need to find something
that we can use to wall her in,

20:53.879 --> 20:56.798
to keep her from stepping
outside her bounds.

20:59.218 --> 21:02.679
There is something I've been looking into.

21:03.472 --> 21:04.848
What is it?

21:04.932 --> 21:08.227
According to the Pact,
I can't discuss ongoing investigations.

21:09.520 --> 21:13.023
-You sound like Billings.
-He's not so bad.

21:14.525 --> 21:16.193
He's your replacement.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.322
Whatever it is you're onto,

21:20.906 --> 21:25.994
I hope you get to the bottom of it
before Judge Meadows gets rid of you.

21:27.538 --> 21:28.914
Because as soon as she does,

21:29.706 --> 21:32.292
there's nothing either of us can do
to stop her.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.880
Leave it there, Carl.

21:36.964 --> 21:38.298
Not Carl.

21:38.382 --> 21:40.759
It's the sheriff.
I'm here with your breakfast.

21:41.927 --> 21:43.262
Leave it and go.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.015
I wanna ask you some questions.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.600
I'm not well.

21:49.518 --> 21:53.146
My first one has to do with your policy
of locking up citizens

21:53.230 --> 21:55.482
and then drugging them against their will.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.793
I wasn't expecting company.
I've been sick.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.422
Yeah. That's what your secretary said.

22:19.965 --> 22:24.052
Didn't stop you from forcing your way
in here and violating my privacy.

22:25.846 --> 22:27.514
Don't worry. You'll get it back.

22:28.307 --> 22:31.977
As soon as you tell me why you're keeping
Gloria Hildebrandt captive in Medical.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.021
Who?

22:34.104 --> 22:35.606
The fertility counselor.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.276
Oh, her.

22:40.027 --> 22:41.445
It's for her own good.

22:42.196 --> 22:44.948
You're drugging her 'cause you think
she said something to Allison Becker

22:45.032 --> 22:46.408
that made her want to go out.

22:46.491 --> 22:48.160
I don't know
where you're getting all this.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.453
In Gloria's file.

22:49.536 --> 22:53.916
Gloria said to her that she's not the type
the Silo wanted having children,

22:53.999 --> 22:55.125
so I wanna talk to her.

22:55.209 --> 22:56.418
Why?

22:57.794 --> 22:59.588
The relic investigation,
the one you approved.

23:00.589 --> 23:03.717
She's been on your watch list for years.
I figured she might know something.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.385
You're not a good liar, Sheriff.

23:05.469 --> 23:07.513
Then let me talk to her,
and I'll leave you alone.

23:07.596 --> 23:10.891
-I'm not stopping you.
-Her brain is filled with drugs.

23:10.974 --> 23:14.061
Gloria doesn't have dementia any more
than you have a cold.

23:14.144 --> 23:19.316
So, not satisfied with sheriff,
a post that you're not qualified to fill,

23:19.399 --> 23:21.818
-you're now diagnosing people?
-You don't want me to be sheriff.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.320
I want to talk to Gloria.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.698
So why don't you lift
whatever medical order she's under,

23:26.782 --> 23:29.159
and then I'll turn in my badge
by the end of the week.

23:31.370 --> 23:35.290
I want you to go
before I summon Judicial security.

23:35.374 --> 23:36.792
Don't threaten me with Sims.

23:37.292 --> 23:38.627
I'm making you a good offer.

23:39.503 --> 23:42.089
Let me take Gloria out of Medical
for a few hours,

23:42.172 --> 23:44.299
and then I'll be back down in Mechanical
before you know it.

23:44.383 --> 23:46.760
-It's not possible.
-Course it is. You lift the order.

23:47.511 --> 23:48.512
I can't.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.805
You're the judge.

23:50.764 --> 23:55.936
I said I can't, and there isn't anything
that I can do about it.

23:57.771 --> 24:00.649
You need to stop doing what you're doing.

24:00.732 --> 24:02.693
Not until I find out what I wanna know.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.825
-They'll never let you.
-Who will not let me? What do you mean?

24:10.534 --> 24:11.785
Who are they?

24:18.333 --> 24:20.002
Is this how it works?

24:24.965 --> 24:26.717
The apartment, the relics…

24:28.844 --> 24:30.846
You get to keep them
as long as you're quiet?

24:35.267 --> 24:36.268
Wow.

24:36.351 --> 24:39.229
No wonder you stay in here,
drinking your cold medicine.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.441
You don't know anything about me.

24:43.192 --> 24:44.568
Now get out!

24:55.120 --> 24:56.121
Stop.

25:01.251 --> 25:03.629
Nichols visited Hildebrandt in Medical?

25:03.712 --> 25:05.339
-Yesterday.
-Show me.

25:13.222 --> 25:14.848
How long have those been there?

25:15.933 --> 25:17.935
-They were there yesterday.
-You should have told me.

25:18.018 --> 25:20.020
Sorry, sir. We'll send someone in.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.251
Jules?

25:47.464 --> 25:51.301
You wanna come in?

25:56.265 --> 25:57.975
They transferred me here after…

26:01.436 --> 26:05.482
It's small, but I'm only here to sleep.

26:07.776 --> 26:13.031
I've thought so many times
about what I'd say to you if you--

26:13.115 --> 26:14.116
if you came back.

26:14.199 --> 26:16.201
And now you're here,
I don't even know where to start.

26:16.285 --> 26:17.911
Don't worry about it.
That's not why I'm here.

26:17.995 --> 26:20.914
I want to ask you for a favor,
and then I'll be out of your way.

26:21.498 --> 26:22.499
That's not what I want.

26:22.583 --> 26:24.585
There's a patient in long-term care,

26:25.544 --> 26:28.797
and I need you to help me get her
out of there for maybe one, two hours.

26:28.881 --> 26:30.507
Whoa, just hold on a minute.

26:30.591 --> 26:32.593
I think she's being held and drugged
against her will.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.928
I need the drugs to wear off,
so I can find out why.

26:35.554 --> 26:37.514
You shouldn't be talking like that.

26:37.598 --> 26:40.142
It's dangerous. I can't do that.

26:42.436 --> 26:45.439
Yeah, I should have known
you wouldn't come through.

26:48.442 --> 26:49.401
Wait.

27:08.003 --> 27:09.963
Sorry, Doctor. I didn't hear you coming.

27:10.047 --> 27:14.843
I just came to raid your medicine cabinet.

27:15.427 --> 27:16.970
I'll get the inventory sheet
for you to sign.

27:17.054 --> 27:18.305
I just came to nab two aspirin.

27:18.972 --> 27:22.559
I thought I could tough it out,
but this headache has other plans.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.146
I'm heading home for the night.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.023
Help yourself.

27:28.106 --> 27:29.024
Thank you.

28:00.305 --> 28:02.891
Gloria, can you hear me?

28:04.059 --> 28:06.061
I've come to take you for a walk.

28:07.980 --> 28:10.023
How would you like to visit the nursery?

28:12.526 --> 28:13.902
Babies.

28:53.233 --> 28:55.569
-Did anyone see you?
-I don't think so.

28:58.030 --> 28:59.156
We're safe now.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.158
I don't know why,
but they don't listen in here.

29:01.241 --> 29:05.704
Gloria? Gloria, do you remember me?
I'm the sheriff. We met yesterday.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.998
-They've got her on a sedative.
-Yeah, I know. I told you.

29:08.081 --> 29:11.084
Well, it could take five or six hours
for it to flush through her system.

29:11.168 --> 29:12.252
We got to get her back

29:12.336 --> 29:14.630
-before the night nurse starts his rounds.
-Fuck.

29:14.713 --> 29:18.592
I know you're frustrated.
Let's step back and take a deep breath.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.636
That didn't work when I was five.
It still doesn't.

29:22.137 --> 29:24.806
There's gotta be something we can do.
Can we give her coffee?

29:24.890 --> 29:27.267
Can we put her underneath
a cold shower? Anything?

29:27.351 --> 29:29.019
She's not a machine
we can switch on and off.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.771
So that's it? You won't even try?

29:33.148 --> 29:35.817
I could try giving her something
to reverse the sedation.

29:35.901 --> 29:36.944
Why didn't you say that before?

29:37.027 --> 29:38.946
-'Cause it doesn't always work.
-Okay.

29:39.696 --> 29:41.448
There can be side effects.

29:42.282 --> 29:47.496
They are doing this to her,
and I need to find out why.

29:47.579 --> 29:49.831
So, please.

29:50.624 --> 29:53.627
Okay. I'll get some things.

30:17.526 --> 30:20.153
Gloria, can you hear me?

30:23.949 --> 30:26.451
What's wrong?

30:26.535 --> 30:27.661
This is what I was afraid of.

30:27.744 --> 30:30.372
-What's happening to her?
-Shit! She's having a seizure.

30:32.875 --> 30:34.293
Jules, I need your help.

30:38.088 --> 30:42.092
-It's okay. You know what to do.
-Okay.

30:44.011 --> 30:46.555
One one thousand. Two one thousand.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.557
Three one thousand.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.809
Four one thousand. Five one thousand.

30:50.893 --> 30:52.936
Six one thousand. Seven one thousand.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.063
Eight one thousand. Nine one thousand.

30:55.147 --> 30:56.190
Ten.

30:56.273 --> 30:58.400
Eleven. Twelve.

31:05.032 --> 31:06.033
It's abating.

31:08.368 --> 31:09.286
Is she okay?

31:11.955 --> 31:12.956
Are you?

31:14.499 --> 31:17.836
Yeah. I'm fine.

31:25.594 --> 31:26.929
We shouldn't wake her.

31:27.888 --> 31:29.765
It'll have to wait.

32:03.006 --> 32:06.510
We lost the sheriff.
She was last seen heading into Medical.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.263
We figured she was coming back for
the old woman, but she went the other way.

32:09.346 --> 32:11.098
Must have gone someplace
where there's a camera down.

32:11.181 --> 32:14.017
-She wouldn't know that.
-Maybe she lucked into a blind spot.

32:15.185 --> 32:17.062
Where are the blind spots on Medical?

32:17.729 --> 32:19.898
We've been repurposing cameras
from down there for years.

32:19.982 --> 32:22.526
The last few we took
went to replace the busted ones on 52.

32:22.609 --> 32:25.112
Look, we try and keep
the main areas of Medical covered but--

32:25.195 --> 32:29.157
But none of you have any idea
where she could be? None of you?

32:30.284 --> 32:34.037
Then get a map and start checking
every single room for what we're missing.

32:41.211 --> 32:42.212
What?

32:42.296 --> 32:44.047
That badge looks good on you.

32:45.174 --> 32:47.551
My daughter, the sheriff.

32:47.634 --> 32:49.678
Yeah, well, it's not for long, so…

32:50.721 --> 32:52.264
What's this about, Jules?

32:53.265 --> 32:54.433
Why would I tell you?

32:58.228 --> 32:59.479
I need a coffee.

33:01.148 --> 33:03.317
-You want a cup?
-Nope. Thanks.

33:11.700 --> 33:12.826
Where am I?

33:14.494 --> 33:15.495
Gloria?

33:17.915 --> 33:19.625
You're in the nursery.

33:21.335 --> 33:22.961
-Why?
-I'm the sheriff.

33:23.045 --> 33:26.256
I've-- I brought you here 'cause
I need to ask you some questions.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.717
You're not the sheriff. He's--

33:28.800 --> 33:30.594
That was Holston. Holston Becker.

33:30.677 --> 33:34.640
He went out three years
after his wife Allison went out to clean.

33:34.723 --> 33:37.935
And you spoke to her about her fertility.

33:38.894 --> 33:40.562
Look, I know this is a lot to remember,

33:40.646 --> 33:41.980
but I really need you to try.

33:42.064 --> 33:43.273
Did the two of you

33:43.357 --> 33:44.942
talk about anything else?

33:45.025 --> 33:46.193
How is she?

33:46.276 --> 33:49.488
She's still out of it.
I'm running out of time. And--

33:50.822 --> 33:53.033
Gloria.

33:53.116 --> 33:56.161
I'm Dr. Nichols.
I'm just gonna listen to your heart. Okay?

33:56.245 --> 33:59.122
Nichols.

34:00.457 --> 34:04.086
I know you.

34:04.670 --> 34:07.256
-What do you want from me?
-It's okay. He's my dad.

34:07.339 --> 34:09.216
-He's just trying to help--
-He works for them.

34:09.299 --> 34:11.927
-What is she talking about?
-It was him.

34:12.636 --> 34:15.013
-He was my doctor.
-What is she talking about?

34:15.097 --> 34:18.350
-Was she one of your patients?
-You. It was you.

34:18.433 --> 34:20.268
-Answer me, were you?
-You. It was him.

34:20.351 --> 34:22.396
I don't-- It would have been 40 years ago.

34:22.478 --> 34:25.065
-He stopped me from having a baby.
-What? Is that-- Is this true?

34:25.148 --> 34:26.650
-It was you!
-Jules, I--

34:26.733 --> 34:29.402
-Making it all come back.
-No. You're upsetting her.

34:29.485 --> 34:30.904
I'm not the one
who's put her through this.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.906
-Go. Get out of here. Get out.
-No. Not again.

34:32.989 --> 34:35.117
-Hey, Gloria. Look at me.
-No!

34:35.199 --> 34:36.743
It's okay. He's gone.

34:38.245 --> 34:39.913
Hey, what did you mean,
he worked for them?

34:39.996 --> 34:41.915
-What do you mean--
-I don't want to be here.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.000
It's okay.

34:43.667 --> 34:47.170
Listen to me. They are doing this to you.

34:47.254 --> 34:49.715
They're drugging you
so that you will forget.

34:49.797 --> 34:52.092
I wanna forget.
I want to be anywhere but here.

34:52.176 --> 34:53.385
I don't trust you.

35:03.187 --> 35:04.771
You've seen this before, haven't you?

35:06.940 --> 35:07.941
Oh, my.

35:09.359 --> 35:12.654
-Where did you get this?
-It belonged to someone I knew. George.

35:12.738 --> 35:14.281
I was told he got it from you.

35:14.364 --> 35:15.449
Little George?

35:15.532 --> 35:17.910
He's not the one I gave it to.
I gave it to his mother.

35:18.619 --> 35:20.579
-I can't remember her name.
-It's okay.

35:20.662 --> 35:23.874
-She was one of us.
-What do you mean "one of us"?

35:26.210 --> 35:30.130
I don't know you,
and I don't know what you want.

35:35.677 --> 35:38.180
Have you heard of the Flamekeepers?

35:40.015 --> 35:41.016
No.

35:41.683 --> 35:44.603
That's because they erased us.

35:44.686 --> 35:46.188
-Who did?
-The Silo.

35:46.271 --> 35:47.648
They've been trying since the rebellion.

35:47.731 --> 35:50.275
That's when they put something
in the water so memories would fade.

35:50.359 --> 35:51.276
What?

35:51.360 --> 35:55.948
They wanted to erase the past
and anyone who tried to preserve it.

35:56.573 --> 35:59.368
I don't understand.
Who were the Flamekeepers?

35:59.451 --> 36:03.872
The people who fought back,
who kept things, like this book.

36:03.956 --> 36:05.832
To keep their memories alive.

36:05.916 --> 36:08.335
-Are you one of them?
-Yes, I was.

36:08.418 --> 36:11.171
Until they put our flame out.

36:13.423 --> 36:17.511
You said my dad stopped you
from having a baby.

36:17.594 --> 36:20.764
-They wanted us to die off.
-What?

36:20.848 --> 36:25.310
They made us think we had a chance
of having a family, but we never did.

36:25.394 --> 36:28.856
Wait. And the doctors knew about this?

36:29.523 --> 36:30.732
They had to.

36:30.816 --> 36:33.694
They said they were taking out
our birth control.

36:33.777 --> 36:35.571
But it was a lie.

36:36.738 --> 36:41.034
I figured it out
after we failed our second lottery.

36:41.118 --> 36:43.662
Henry, my husband,
he wasn't a Flamekeeper,

36:43.745 --> 36:45.497
and he wanted children so badly.

36:45.581 --> 36:47.124
And I knew he'd never
have a chance with me

36:47.207 --> 36:51.712
and he'd never go if I told him
the truth. So, I pushed him away.

36:53.130 --> 36:57.301
I ran into him once
when he was with his children,

36:58.260 --> 36:59.887
and he pretended not to know me.

37:02.347 --> 37:06.560
Seeing what they took from us,
I couldn't do it anymore.

37:06.643 --> 37:11.690
So, I gave my most treasured relic

37:11.773 --> 37:14.109
to the last Flamekeeper I knew.

37:15.110 --> 37:17.029
And that was George's mom?

37:17.112 --> 37:20.032
Yeah. Her name, it was Anne.
She died not long after that.

37:20.991 --> 37:23.243
Her poor little boy had no one.

37:26.455 --> 37:28.248
When was the last time you saw him?

37:28.332 --> 37:32.503
Did he say anything to you
about a hard drive?

37:32.586 --> 37:34.505
I kept tabs on George
when he was growing up,

37:34.588 --> 37:37.174
but I lost track of him over the years.

37:37.257 --> 37:38.258
How is he?

37:42.763 --> 37:44.056
When?

37:45.724 --> 37:46.975
Last year.

37:47.059 --> 37:54.024
He fell off the stairs,
and it wasn't an accident.

37:55.442 --> 37:57.611
This place, it's--

37:59.988 --> 38:03.825
They may be keeping me drugged,
but at least I can escape.

38:03.909 --> 38:05.244
Look at this.

38:05.827 --> 38:06.828
Let me find it.

38:09.873 --> 38:11.124
The water.

38:13.001 --> 38:15.254
They called it the ocean.

38:16.380 --> 38:19.800
I've pictured myself there so many times,

38:20.300 --> 38:25.931
but I'll never know what it sounded like
and how it smelled.

38:29.977 --> 38:30.978
Can I hold it?

38:33.313 --> 38:34.314
Yeah, sure.

38:49.830 --> 38:51.123
Hello.

38:51.957 --> 38:53.041
Hello.

38:56.336 --> 38:57.671
Hello.

39:03.218 --> 39:05.429
You're Hanna Nichols's daughter.

39:07.431 --> 39:08.974
Yeah. Did you know her?

39:10.934 --> 39:13.562
I remember hearing about her from Anne.

39:14.313 --> 39:16.023
George's mom knew my mom?

39:16.106 --> 39:19.109
Well, she was helping your mother
with something.

39:19.651 --> 39:23.572
I can't remember what.
It was some kind of magnifying device.

39:24.072 --> 39:26.283
Do you know, I was always really surprised

39:26.366 --> 39:30.287
that they let a woman like Hanna Nichols
have children.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.457
Was my mom a Flamekeeper?

39:34.791 --> 39:37.544
She shared the same curiosity.

39:38.462 --> 39:43.008
It's the one thing
that they can never breed out of us.

39:45.427 --> 39:49.806
When I heard what had happened to her…

39:51.850 --> 39:54.561
it really felt like
we'd lost one of our own.

40:15.207 --> 40:17.251
-How is she?
-I'm taking her back.

40:17.876 --> 40:19.670
Well, it's not safe for you, Jules.

40:22.089 --> 40:25.259
You are the last person
I would ever trust to tell me what's safe.

40:25.342 --> 40:26.718
I would never put you in danger.

40:26.802 --> 40:29.346
But you would trick your patients
into believing

40:29.429 --> 40:31.682
their birth control has been removed?

40:34.101 --> 40:35.769
I didn't have a choice.

40:35.853 --> 40:37.855
If I wanted to do this work
to help people and--

40:37.938 --> 40:42.860
Help? The only ones you're helping
are the ones trying to breed people out.

40:42.943 --> 40:46.321
You have to understand.
They never told me anything about that.

40:46.405 --> 40:47.698
When they came to me,

40:47.781 --> 40:51.034
they said this was necessary
for long-term survival

40:51.118 --> 40:52.995
to prevent genetic disease
from running rampant.

40:53.078 --> 40:55.289
But why lie to people?

40:57.749 --> 40:59.543
Why give them false hope?

41:00.544 --> 41:03.380
Did you ever think to question that?

41:05.591 --> 41:06.925
Of course I did.

41:08.886 --> 41:13.182
I always wondered if somehow they
wanted to punish the ones they picked.

41:14.683 --> 41:17.603
And yet, you just went along
with whatever they said?

41:17.686 --> 41:21.064
There are consequences
to asking questions.

41:21.148 --> 41:22.691
We both know that.

41:24.359 --> 41:27.196
-I know you think I betrayed Mom.
-No, don't.

41:31.533 --> 41:33.994
Clearly she wasn't the only one
that you betrayed.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.215
Shit, I got her.

41:46.298 --> 41:50.010
Hey. Hey! What's going on? Is she okay?

41:50.093 --> 41:53.055
One of my deputies found her
wandering around the stairs, so…

41:53.138 --> 41:55.432
You said she didn't go back
to Hildebrandt.

41:55.516 --> 41:58.435
-She didn't.
-Then how the hell do you explain that?

41:58.519 --> 42:01.563
-I don't know.
-Find out where they just came from. Now!

42:01.647 --> 42:02.940
And stay on them!

42:03.023 --> 42:04.399
Sheriff, I can assure you--

42:04.483 --> 42:06.735
I'm going to escort her
back to her room and file a report.

42:11.657 --> 42:13.825
Wait. I wanna walk.

42:14.910 --> 42:15.911
Okay.

42:20.165 --> 42:22.334
-You okay?
-Yeah, I think so.

42:35.264 --> 42:37.057
Can I see it one more time?

42:37.975 --> 42:38.976
Sure.

42:52.614 --> 42:55.325
-You keep it safe.
-Yeah, I will.

43:01.623 --> 43:03.834
My flowers, they're gone.

43:05.544 --> 43:09.131
I remember now. Sheriff Holston was here.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.259
-When?
-I don't know.

43:12.342 --> 43:14.094
Not long ago. I lose track.

43:15.137 --> 43:18.932
He brought flowers,
and he put them right there.

43:19.016 --> 43:21.310
-In front of the mirror?
-Yes.

43:38.994 --> 43:42.706
-Never seen this one before.
-Maybe it's what he wanted you to see?

43:43.707 --> 43:45.459
No idea what it is.

43:59.723 --> 44:01.850
I think they can see us
through the mirror.

44:01.934 --> 44:04.228
-That's why Holston put flowers there.
-What?

44:04.311 --> 44:07.105
They've got these devices
like the sensors outside,

44:07.189 --> 44:09.274
and I think they're watching us.

44:12.694 --> 44:16.490
Do you remember anything else
when he was here? Anything he said?

44:16.573 --> 44:19.159
No. He wasn't here for very long.

44:19.243 --> 44:21.787
And he spent most of his time
working on that vent.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.138
She's blocked our view.

44:54.152 --> 44:55.445
What is she doing?

44:56.071 --> 44:58.448
-The problem is we only have audio.
-No, Diego.

44:59.032 --> 45:01.326
The problem is
she knows there are cameras.

45:01.410 --> 45:03.453
What is it? What did you find?

45:03.537 --> 45:06.498
Send the raiders. Now!

45:19.428 --> 45:21.054
I can't stay. They're gonna be coming.

45:25.184 --> 45:27.895
-You're the last Flamekeeper now.
-No.

45:27.978 --> 45:32.065
You didn't ask for it. It's not fair.
But it's the way it is. It's down to you.

45:32.149 --> 45:34.902
-No.
-If you let it die, the truth dies too.

45:34.985 --> 45:36.069
I have to go.

45:36.153 --> 45:38.071
What would your mother want you to do?

45:39.948 --> 45:42.951
-I wish I could ask her, but I can't.
-No, you can't.

45:43.035 --> 45:45.829
But do you know why she killed herself?

46:04.389 --> 46:05.390
Where is she?
