12:30.837 --> 12:32.316
BESS:
I don't know. I...

12:32.360 --> 12:34.797
I-I could hear voices.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.277
I could hear voices,

12:36.320 --> 12:38.366
and-and then all it went dark. Hold up.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.716
Are you wearing Tiffany Hudson's
engagement ring?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.544
Shh... Oh, my God.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.285
Did you do it?

12:44.328 --> 12:45.590
Did I kill Tiffany? No!

12:45.634 --> 12:46.853
[whispers]:
Of course I did not.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.506
So you just happened

12:48.550 --> 12:50.595
to have her ring.Yeah. I...

12:50.639 --> 12:53.120
Listen, okay?
I found that ring,

12:53.163 --> 12:56.950
okay, on the ground in the
parking lot the night she died.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.342
I didn't know it was hers.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.215
I just thought it was
a random lost ring.

13:01.258 --> 13:05.567
By the time I realized it was
Tiffany's, we were suspects.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.351
I couldn't
give it back. Really?

13:07.395 --> 13:10.006
I like sparkly things, okay?
They calm me.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.400
Okay.
T-That's the answer you're going with?

13:12.443 --> 13:15.098
You know, this isn't even
about the ring.

13:15.142 --> 13:17.884
Okay? Something
is out to get me.Okay.

13:17.927 --> 13:21.278
Ghosts don't just attack people
like that, though. Do they?

13:21.322 --> 13:22.976
Well, whatever's in
the walk-in just did.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.021
If it attacked you,
I don't think it's Dead Lucy.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.762
Oh, so there are two ghosts now?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.764
Excellent.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.374
Bess, can you think
of any spirits

13:30.418 --> 13:32.028
that you've pissed off lately?

13:32.072 --> 13:34.248
I don't know, maybe the one
that you stole from?

13:34.291 --> 13:36.293
[exhales]

13:38.861 --> 13:41.821
Do you think the ghost
in the freezer is Tiffany?

13:43.779 --> 13:46.129
D-Do you think she's mad
about the ring?

13:46.173 --> 13:48.262
Do you think the ring is haunted?

13:48.305 --> 13:49.785
Oh.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.006
I might know someone
who can help, okay?

13:53.049 --> 13:54.703
It's gonna take me
a minute to find her.

LAURA:
Hi, Ace.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.311
Oh!

14:37.354 --> 14:39.182
Wow!

14:39.226 --> 14:42.359
[chuckles]
This is random.

14:42.403 --> 14:43.970
Is it?

14:44.013 --> 14:47.364
'Cause you've been tailing me
for the last two hours?

14:47.408 --> 14:48.713
These are for you.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.933
For your effort.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.848
There's a lot of people
that look like me.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.415
You're probably mistaking me
for someone else.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.373
Yeah. Mm-hmm. I was just...

14:56.417 --> 14:57.461
walking.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.985
S-Scones.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.596
You're still doing
the bumbling stoner thing, huh?

15:01.639 --> 15:03.119
Don't worry, it's still cute.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.904
But what's your deal?

15:04.947 --> 15:06.862
We hang out all last summer,
you don't call, you don't text.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.559
Now you're, uh, stalking me?

15:08.603 --> 15:10.648
I just didn't know what to say.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.433
Yeah?

15:12.476 --> 15:15.653
But I bumble
just as well un-stoned.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.655
Okay, let's catch up. Let's catch up.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.701
Mm-hmm.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.703
I'm sorry about your sister.

15:21.746 --> 15:23.661
Yeah.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.707
Our last conversation
was a fight.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.666
She said she was working up
the courage to divorce Ryan.

15:28.710 --> 15:32.192
I told her to suck
it up. Now she's dead.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.110
Have you heard anything?

15:37.153 --> 15:39.112
I know it's a small
town, and people talk.

15:39.155 --> 15:42.767
Don't the police
have any suspects?

15:42.811 --> 15:44.856
Some friends that I work with
got brought in

15:44.900 --> 15:48.077
the night it happened,
but the cops let them go.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.340
Well, what did the cops
talk to them about?

15:50.384 --> 15:53.474
Tiffany called 911
the night that she died

15:53.517 --> 15:56.694
and there's an audio recording
of it.

15:58.653 --> 16:01.656
Is there, uh, is there
any way I can hear it?

16:01.699 --> 16:03.440
Can you pull one of
your hacker moves?

16:03.484 --> 16:04.789
I'm kind of
out of that business.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.835
Ace, please.

16:11.231 --> 16:14.451
And then, right there.Mm-hmm.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.671
When did you start wearing
your wedding ring again?

16:16.714 --> 16:17.977
Uh, today.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.674
Felt appropriate.

16:19.717 --> 16:22.982
And that. Here you go.
Now, listen, my family

16:23.025 --> 16:25.985
would like you to read this
statement after the funeral.

16:29.292 --> 16:32.513
Your family is founding
a nonprofit in Tiffany's name?

16:32.556 --> 16:34.297
Yeah.
Good.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.778
That'll go a long way
with the community.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.563
Autopsy report
must've been a relief,

16:39.607 --> 16:42.175
knowing what happened
with certainty. Yeah, it was.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.525
Speaking of which, um,
what's the next step

16:44.568 --> 16:47.571
in me getting my money
from Tiffany's estate?

16:49.225 --> 16:52.663
Well, I'll need a signed copy
of the autopsy report

16:52.707 --> 16:55.536
from the medical examiner
and Tiffany's death certificate.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.713
And I'll file those along with
your prenup in probate court.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.758
Cool.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.611
NANCY:
A British passport?

17:27.655 --> 17:29.613
Bess Turani.

17:29.657 --> 17:32.051
No wonder Jeff
never heard of Bess Marvin.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.748
She doesn't even exist.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.104
What the hell are you doing?

17:42.148 --> 17:44.628
You tell me, Bess Turani.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.630
God. How dare you go
through my stuff?

17:46.674 --> 17:48.676
You've been lying about
who you are all summer.

17:48.719 --> 17:52.027
Why?
I-I don't have to explain myself to you.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.811
Oh, so I give you a place
to crash last night,

17:53.855 --> 17:56.031
the least you can do
is tell me who you really are.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.685
[sighs]
GEORGE: Hey!

17:57.728 --> 17:59.730
Team meeting.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.823
You have to toast the bread,
otherwise it gets all soggy.

18:05.867 --> 18:09.610
[sighs]
Mom, Nancy, Bess.

18:09.653 --> 18:10.915
Your mom is our help?

18:10.959 --> 18:12.526
VICTORIA:
Eh, I'm a clairvoyant.

18:12.569 --> 18:13.744
I mean, the dead can't
speak through me,

18:13.788 --> 18:16.704
but I see things.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.619
Mm-hmm. Usually at the bottom
of a bottle.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.621
George never
appreciated my gift.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.753
[scoffs]
Gift.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.322
Your Kate Drew's
daughter, right?

18:26.366 --> 18:27.758
Shame about your mom.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.586
Death always takes
the good ones first.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.153
All right, I briefed her
about the freezer.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.850
Yeah, can I show you...?

18:35.636 --> 18:37.638
[exhales]
Okay.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.901
[laughs softly]
Okay. Um...

18:41.859 --> 18:43.557
VICTORIA:
Oh, yeah.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.949
Ragged scratches,

18:44.993 --> 18:46.386
they're not too deep.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.170
That's definitely the work of a new ghost.

18:48.214 --> 18:51.347
Uh, one that doesn't understand
what it's doing, like Tiffany.

18:51.391 --> 18:54.872
Okay, and why-why can't Tiffany
just talk to me?

18:54.916 --> 18:56.657
Oh, most ghosts don't have
the power of speech,

18:56.700 --> 18:57.658
unless they're speaking
through a medium.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.399
They usually express

18:59.442 --> 19:01.836
extreme emotion in, like,

19:01.879 --> 19:03.664
dangerous
and unpredictable ways.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.145
Like when George was little,
she'd pee on the floor

19:06.188 --> 19:07.668
and bite you to get
your attention.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.149
Thanks for that. Does Tiffany want

19:10.192 --> 19:13.064
to hurt me? No, no, no. This
seems like a...

19:13.108 --> 19:15.328
cry for help. Mm, she's
not gonna leave you alone

19:15.371 --> 19:16.677
until you help her.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.896
I-I... okay,
and how do I do that?

19:19.941 --> 19:21.769
Hey.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.948
Two circles: one's the
living, one's the dead.

19:26.991 --> 19:29.255
This middle where they meet,

19:29.298 --> 19:31.300
those are the souls
stuck in between,

19:31.344 --> 19:34.869
the confused new ghosts that
think they're still alive.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.785
Like Tiffany.
Wait,

19:37.828 --> 19:39.265
but why is she freaking out now?

19:39.308 --> 19:40.918
Because today's her funeral.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.747
And she sees that she's
no longer attached to her body,

19:43.791 --> 19:46.185
but she doesn't understand why.
Where's the ring?

19:49.318 --> 19:51.320
[sighs]

19:55.585 --> 19:59.198
When she was alive,
this was likely

19:59.241 --> 20:01.417
Tiffany's treasured possession.

20:01.461 --> 20:04.246
So, in death, she's drawn to it,
like a beacon.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.726
To get rid of the ghost,

20:05.769 --> 20:09.556
just place the ring back
on Tiffany's finger.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.906
Put it on the corpse?

20:11.949 --> 20:13.777
It'll help guide the ghost back
into her body. Mm.

20:13.821 --> 20:17.172
And then, take this.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.784
[quietly]:
Not this. Not this.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.743
Ah! This one.

20:22.786 --> 20:25.398
And why a mirror? Mirrors attract
spirits.

20:25.441 --> 20:29.271
So place this over her heart so
the ghost sees its reflection

20:29.315 --> 20:31.186
when it rejoins
the body and knows

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
that it's in the right
place. Otherwise,

20:33.275 --> 20:37.018
it can get distracted and end up
somewhere else entirely.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.586
And the most important step...

20:41.805 --> 20:44.504
...refill my glass.
GEORGE: Okay. We're done here.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.336
Tiffany's services
will be taking place

20:50.379 --> 20:52.251
at the Horseshoe Bay
Funeral Home.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.035
That's our best shot.

20:54.078 --> 20:56.777
You know, I don't
think I can do this.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.779
Okay? I was
already attacked.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.085
By Tiffany... who knows what
else she could do to me?

21:01.129 --> 21:02.783
I'll do it.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.916
Oh, my God!
George! Thank you! Oh. Okay, Bess. Whoa!

21:05.960 --> 21:07.048
Thank you! Whoa. Dude.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.571
I'll stand by the door
and let you know

21:08.615 --> 21:10.094
when the coast is clear.
BESS: And I will be there

21:10.138 --> 21:13.010
for moral support.

21:15.099 --> 21:17.145
Hey, um...

21:20.366 --> 21:21.889
...if you don't want to do this,

21:21.932 --> 21:23.847
considering your history with Ryan...

21:23.891 --> 21:26.676
That's exactly why I shoulddo it.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.939
I was the other woman.

21:28.983 --> 21:32.900
I mean, what I did
to Tiffany was... wrong.

21:32.943 --> 21:34.293
I mean, the least I can do

21:34.336 --> 21:36.338
is help her find some peace
in the afterlife.

21:36.382 --> 21:40.342
I was actually gonna say
you don't have to come.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.562
Why wouldn't I come?

21:42.605 --> 21:45.129
I just thought the whole
funeral thing might be hard.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.654
I can handle it.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.676
[vehicle approaches]

22:12.331 --> 22:14.333
[car door shuts, car beeps]

22:19.729 --> 22:21.209
That autopsy is a lie.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.689
Tiffany had a puncture wound

22:22.732 --> 22:24.038
behind her left ear
from a needle.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.996
No mention of that anywhere.
How do you know

22:26.040 --> 22:28.085
about a puncture wound?

22:28.129 --> 22:30.131
Because I put it there.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.089
You what?

22:32.133 --> 22:34.004
When I broke into the morgue,

22:34.048 --> 22:36.485
I stuck a needle behind Tiffany's ear,

22:36.529 --> 22:38.095
and I stole a vial of her blood.

22:38.139 --> 22:41.229
Nancy, for God's sake,
you can't keep doing

22:41.272 --> 22:42.535
things like this! I want the truth!

22:42.578 --> 22:44.667
Nobody is looking out for Tiffany!

22:44.711 --> 22:46.626
Everybody is so busy looking out

22:46.669 --> 22:48.279
for the Hudsons instead.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.151
Ryan is my client.
That's my job. And you have

22:50.194 --> 22:53.763
no concern that the autopsy's
a complete lie?

22:53.807 --> 22:56.026
I have more important things
to concern myself with,

22:56.070 --> 22:58.855
like paying off medical debt.
And your bail.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.379
How convenient for you.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.250
To have a daughter
and a dead wife

23:02.293 --> 23:03.817
to blame your selling out on.

23:08.561 --> 23:09.823
[door slams]

23:16.438 --> 23:18.179
NANCY:
You can tell a lot about a person

23:18.222 --> 23:20.355
by the way they act
at a funeral.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.619
Ryan hasn't looked at
Tiffany's casket once.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.016
Bess appears to be
too terrified of the Marvins

23:29.059 --> 23:31.758
to talk to them.

23:31.801 --> 23:34.978
And Nick is wearing his heart
on his sleeve.

23:46.512 --> 23:50.037
I wish, um,
you could've known her...

23:50.080 --> 23:51.952
before everything that happened.

23:51.995 --> 23:53.693
Well, we all would've had

23:53.736 --> 23:56.565
a very ambitious book club.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.567
Ned Nickerson.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.613
Oh.

24:00.656 --> 24:01.831
Hi.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.095
Tiffany spoke so highly of you.

24:05.139 --> 24:09.186
Thank you for being
such a good friend.

24:09.230 --> 24:10.797
Uh, yeah. Of course.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.974
Um, she was...
one of a kind.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.951
Did you talk to your friend?

24:34.995 --> 24:38.520
ACE:
Yes.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.957
She doesn't know
any more than you do.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.187
EVERETT:
Hey.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.406
Carson.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.757
Glad to have you
back in the family.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.760
With respect, Everett,
your son is my client,

25:00.803 --> 25:02.065
not the Hudson family.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.026
Ryan.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.028
RYAN: Thanks. Thanks for coming.
CARSON: Yeah.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.944
Hang in there, okay?

25:12.728 --> 25:15.339
Hey, you're on door duty for George.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.907
Wait, what?

25:19.866 --> 25:21.215
Are you coming with us, then?

25:21.258 --> 25:24.044
I'm just going to look for Everett.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.349
You wait for me out front.

25:28.091 --> 25:31.573
Excuse me, dear?
Do you work here?

25:31.617 --> 25:32.922
[exhales]

25:42.758 --> 25:44.064
I'm sorry I slept
with your husband,

25:44.107 --> 25:46.153
and I hope this
brings you peace.

25:46.196 --> 25:49.025
RYAN: Tiffany is in here now, Dad.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.340
EVERETT:
Thank God that's over.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.825
Well, it's a shame you
never got her pregnant.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.261
What a waste of a marriage.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.306
You're talking about my wife.

26:12.179 --> 26:14.268
That never meant much to you
when she was alive.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.714
[door closes]

26:28.195 --> 26:30.153
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.295
[door closes]

26:58.573 --> 27:00.183
Where were you?
I almost got caught.

27:00.227 --> 27:03.143
I told Bess to watch the door.

27:03.186 --> 27:05.145
Okay... She didn't.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.277
[sighs] Oh, God...

27:07.321 --> 27:08.714
I'm sorry. A
situation occurred.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.585
What type of situation?

27:10.629 --> 27:13.109
My Lyft is pulling up.

27:13.153 --> 27:14.545
Why don't you carpool
with the Marvins?

27:16.678 --> 27:18.027
I mean, they're all right here.
I'm sure they have plenty

27:18.071 --> 27:20.029
of room for family.

27:21.074 --> 27:23.642
[sighs]
What?

27:25.861 --> 27:28.951
What do you want from me?
NANCY: Answers.

27:28.995 --> 27:32.085
Why are you in Horseshoe Bay?
Who are you really?

27:32.128 --> 27:34.827
[sighs]

27:34.870 --> 27:37.046
[with British accent]:
I think I'm a Marvin.

27:38.526 --> 27:39.962
But I don't know for sure.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.834
How is that possible?

27:41.877 --> 27:45.402
I grew up in a crappy
neighborhood in East London.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.840
My mum would talk about
these Marvins, some fancy family

27:47.883 --> 27:49.668
that we were descended from.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.670
They sounded so

27:51.713 --> 27:54.498
perfect, and when things
got really hard,

27:54.542 --> 27:57.110
I dreamt that I was one of them.

27:57.153 --> 27:59.112
I didn't know if it was
one of my mum's stories

27:59.155 --> 28:03.507
or the truth, so I came
here to find out.

28:03.551 --> 28:04.944
And?

28:04.987 --> 28:06.902
I have a genealogy kit
in my baggage.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.861
I need DNA from one of them.

28:08.904 --> 28:11.167
You told everyone
your last name was Marvin.

28:11.211 --> 28:12.952
Why would you do that? I didn't realize

28:12.995 --> 28:14.170
how small this town was;

28:14.214 --> 28:15.389
I didn't know everyone
knew everyone.

28:15.432 --> 28:16.956
Once you get DNA proof,

28:16.999 --> 28:18.000
what happens?

28:18.044 --> 28:19.785
I'll present myself.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.569
Where? At high tea?

28:21.612 --> 28:23.963
I don't think
you've thought this through.I...

28:24.006 --> 28:26.008
I didn't ask for your opinion.

28:26.052 --> 28:28.184
Hey, just because family
isn't that important to you,

28:28.228 --> 28:29.751
does not mean...
Okay.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.535
You don't know about my life.

28:31.579 --> 28:32.841
And you don't know about mine.

28:37.063 --> 28:39.195
EVERETT:
It means a great deal to us

28:39.239 --> 28:42.677
to see so many familiar faces

28:42.721 --> 28:45.985
who loved Tiffany
as much as we did.

28:46.028 --> 28:48.770
Tiffany was a beacon of light:

28:48.814 --> 28:51.164
loving wife, daughter-in-law,

28:51.207 --> 28:53.035
sister, and friend.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.994
Who always brought with her...

28:55.037 --> 28:58.606
VOICE ON SPEAKER:
911, what's the nature
of your emergency?

28:58.649 --> 29:02.001
TIFFANY'S VOICE:
Help me... [panting]

29:02.044 --> 29:06.570
Please! Please!
I'm at the Claw! No!

29:06.614 --> 29:09.138
That was Tiffany
right before she died.

29:09.182 --> 29:12.533
Panicked. Scared.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.013
That was not the voice
of a woman

29:14.056 --> 29:15.318
who died of natural causes.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.320
That was the voice
of a woman pleading

29:17.364 --> 29:18.844
with her killer. This is neither
the time...

29:18.887 --> 29:20.933
Everett Hudson is a liar!

29:20.976 --> 29:22.238
You didn't care about Tiffany.

29:22.282 --> 29:23.936
Neither did Ryan

29:23.979 --> 29:25.938
or any of you in this family.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.897
My sister was scared of you,
but I'm not.

29:30.203 --> 29:32.074
Tiffany was murdered.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.947
And I'm gonna prove it.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.513
I'd like to apologize
for the interruption,

29:36.557 --> 29:37.993
ladies and gentlemen...

29:44.652 --> 29:46.175
I'm going easy on
you out of respect

29:46.219 --> 29:48.264
for your dad's sacrifice,
so I'm not gonna ask

29:48.308 --> 29:50.919
how you stole that 911 recording

29:50.963 --> 29:53.139
for Laura. I didn't.

29:53.182 --> 29:55.968
I'm just gonna remind you
we had a deal.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.971
And if you're in breach,
I can revoke that deal,

29:59.014 --> 30:02.104
prosecute you to
the full extent of the law.

30:03.149 --> 30:04.715
We're done here.

30:04.759 --> 30:07.066
KAREN:
Hey... Nancy.

30:07.109 --> 30:08.589
How you holding up?

30:08.632 --> 30:10.983
Fine. Why?

30:11.026 --> 30:15.204
Just... if there's anything
that you needed to talk about...

30:15.248 --> 30:17.467
I'm here.

30:20.122 --> 30:23.430
NANCY: Lucy Sable.
Did you know her?

30:24.474 --> 30:27.956
Uh, we were in the same class
in high school.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.915
But we moved
in different circles.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.438
Who do you think killed her?

30:31.481 --> 30:34.006
All we know about the killer
are the bloody knife

30:34.049 --> 30:35.355
and the tire tracks
they left behind

30:35.398 --> 30:36.922
at the crime scene.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.794
So you think somebody
stabbed Lucy before

30:39.838 --> 30:41.056
pushing her off the cliff?

30:43.058 --> 30:47.454
I think that you're asking me
these questions to avoid

30:47.497 --> 30:49.978
talking about who else is here.

30:50.022 --> 30:52.285
Have you been
to your mom's grave?

30:55.070 --> 30:57.420
Hey, Tiffany.

31:00.249 --> 31:02.338
I'm sorry for my
half-assed apology earlier.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.081
You deserve better from life.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.127
And from me.

31:08.170 --> 31:11.086
I'm sorry that I ever
felt sympathy for Ryan.[whispering voices]

31:11.130 --> 31:13.132
I should've had your back
all along.

31:17.092 --> 31:20.400
I hope you're at peace.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.504
One of these is supposed
to be from you.

31:37.547 --> 31:40.072
Not that you couldn't
bring your own.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.551
It's just...

31:41.595 --> 31:44.163
sort of a ritual
I've been doing.

31:44.206 --> 31:45.599
Okay.

31:45.642 --> 31:48.254
I'll come back, then. Hey, hey.

31:48.297 --> 31:52.998
This... tension between us,

31:53.041 --> 31:55.000
it has to stop.

31:55.043 --> 31:58.481
I can't go on like this anymore.

31:58.525 --> 31:59.700
What can I do?

31:59.743 --> 32:03.008
Nothing.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.010
Seriously, Nancy?

32:05.053 --> 32:07.926
I wasn't with Mom when she died.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.234
I didn't get to see
what she was going through

32:12.278 --> 32:14.280
or what she was feeling.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.153
I was in a gym,
dancing with my friends.

32:18.197 --> 32:21.504
I had my phone.
You could have called.

32:21.548 --> 32:26.205
And instead, you made me believe
that everything was okay.

32:26.248 --> 32:29.295
And I never got to say good-bye
because of you.

32:29.338 --> 32:32.385
It's what she wanted.

32:32.428 --> 32:36.258
She wanted you to
remember dance parties

32:36.302 --> 32:39.261
and homemade pizza nights...

32:39.305 --> 32:43.091
and the time that the projector
broke at the drive-in,

32:43.135 --> 32:46.225
and you guys acted out
the entire final scene

32:46.268 --> 32:50.272
ofWhen Harry Met Sally,
verbatim, for the audience.

32:50.316 --> 32:52.883
She didn't want you
to remember her suffering.

32:52.927 --> 32:55.538
She wanted to protect you.

32:55.582 --> 32:58.106
What about what I wanted?

32:59.934 --> 33:04.156
There was so much more
that I had to say.

33:04.199 --> 33:07.246
She knew how much you loved her.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.641
That's all that matters.
That was enough.

33:11.685 --> 33:15.210
I was trying to honor
your mom's wishes.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.517
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.041
Maybe I wasn't.

33:22.435 --> 33:26.178
Whatever you're feeling,
you can carry it with you,

33:26.221 --> 33:29.311
but you can't...

33:29.355 --> 33:31.226
let it consume you.

33:46.459 --> 33:49.288
Thanks for bringing these.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.262
I have to go.

34:15.270 --> 34:17.055
[engine starts]

34:19.709 --> 34:22.190
Hi, Mom.

34:26.281 --> 34:29.284
A lot has happened
since you died.

34:29.328 --> 34:32.722
Most of it's been pretty weird.

34:32.766 --> 34:36.291
I am starting to believe
in ghosts.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.730
[chuckles]

34:42.732 --> 34:44.560
It took me a while
to get there, I think,

34:44.604 --> 34:46.780
because... [sighs]...

34:50.349 --> 34:53.221
I was waiting for you.

34:53.265 --> 34:57.704
I thought, if ghosts exist...

34:57.747 --> 35:00.794
you would come to me.

35:07.322 --> 35:09.846
Why haven't you?

35:13.285 --> 35:17.289
Am I not enough
to keep you here?

35:17.332 --> 35:19.117
[exhales sharply]

35:20.466 --> 35:24.122
Because I really need you.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.124
[sobbing]

35:33.870 --> 35:35.959
Good afternoon.
The Hudson family is honored

35:36.003 --> 35:38.962
to announce the establishment
of the Tiffany Hudson

35:39.006 --> 35:40.921
Educational Outreach Center,

35:40.964 --> 35:44.881
a nonprofit dedicated to
improving academic opportunities

35:44.925 --> 35:47.406
for the children
of Horseshoe Bay.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.190
The organization will launch
at a garden party

35:49.234 --> 35:50.713
tomorrow afternoon.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.672
REPORTER:
Can you tell us more about the autopsy?

35:52.715 --> 35:54.239
REPORTER 2:
What kind of "natural causes"?

35:54.282 --> 35:55.805
My client is confident
I the results.

35:55.849 --> 35:56.937
REPORTER:
Can you verify the accuracy of the autopsy?

35:56.980 --> 35:57.938
Uh, that's it, we're done here.

35:57.981 --> 35:59.505
Thank you very much.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.420
[clears throat]

36:01.463 --> 36:05.337
No. My opinion is that
the autopsy report

36:05.380 --> 36:07.252
is inconclusive.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.036
REPORTER 2:
Are the police reopening the investigation?

36:09.079 --> 36:10.211
We're done here.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.734
Thank you very much.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.649
You just made a huge mistake.

36:13.693 --> 36:17.436
If you want to fire me,
go ahead.

36:17.479 --> 36:20.830
It won't be that easy
for you to leave this time.

36:20.874 --> 36:22.832
REPORTER 2:
What does her sister have to say?

36:22.876 --> 36:24.225
REPORTER:
Mr. Hudson...

36:24.269 --> 36:26.880
We're done here.
Again, thank you very much.

36:26.923 --> 36:29.274
We just ask that you respect
our privacy at this time.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.456
Ace. Ace, come on, wait.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.768
I suck, I know. I...

36:45.812 --> 36:48.249
You did me a favor getting
that 911 recording,

36:48.293 --> 36:51.252
and I totally betrayed you.

36:51.296 --> 36:54.386
It's water under the bridge.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.911
I really did miss you.

36:57.954 --> 36:59.260
Why'd you ignore me?

36:59.304 --> 37:00.914
You left.

37:00.957 --> 37:04.874
Off to Paris, or to
wherever it is you go.

37:04.918 --> 37:07.094
It's tough to keep track
of time zones.

37:07.137 --> 37:09.444
Yeah.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.751
Okay, then. Good night.

37:16.321 --> 37:19.585
You threw me.

37:19.628 --> 37:22.414
When I was with you,
it was intense.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.807
Still is.

37:26.983 --> 37:30.291
If there's anything
I've learned, it's that, uh,

37:30.335 --> 37:32.598
when it feels good,
you shouldn't fight it.

37:49.571 --> 37:51.399
[exhales]

38:04.107 --> 38:07.328
NANCY:
Why would this video play the
night Bess came to my house?

38:07.372 --> 38:10.636
TIFFANY [on tape]:
Help me. Please.
