WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.280
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.418 --> 00:07.179
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.317 --> 00:11.701
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.839 --> 00:14.842
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.980 --> 00:17.638
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.776 --> 00:21.780
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.333 --> 00:25.956
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.095 --> 00:28.580
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.718 --> 00:31.065
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.203 --> 00:34.103
Just to get up that hill

00:34.241 --> 00:36.484
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.622 --> 00:39.177
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.315 --> 00:41.627
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.765 --> 00:43.353
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.491 --> 00:46.149
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.187
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.325 --> 00:53.743
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.881 --> 00:56.608
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.746 --> 00:59.645
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.783 --> 01:05.617
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:20.459 --> 01:23.911
Oh! George? George.
Oh, no!

01:24.049 --> 01:24.981
George...

01:25.119 --> 01:26.396
Weezy, what's wrong?

01:26.534 --> 01:28.881
My wedding ring,
I dropped it
down the sink.

01:29.019 --> 01:30.849
What? Well look,
don't get so upset.

01:30.987 --> 01:32.471
It's probably
still in the pipe.

01:32.609 --> 01:34.577
I'll have it out
for you in a minute.
I'll get my toolkit.

01:34.956 --> 01:35.992
Tool kit?

01:36.130 --> 01:37.476
You mean that
brown paper bag

01:37.614 --> 01:39.133
with a hammer
and a screwdriver?

01:41.066 --> 01:45.208
What are you talking about?
I got more tools than that.
See, I got pliers, too.

01:48.522 --> 01:50.144
George, why don't we
call Maintenance?

01:50.282 --> 01:52.250
Look, Weezy, they take too
damn long to show up.

01:52.388 --> 01:54.217
But you don't know
anything about plumbing.

01:54.355 --> 01:57.358
Trust me, Weezy. I'll have
your ring out of here before
you can count to 100.

01:58.980 --> 02:02.605
Okay, George,
one, two, three...

02:02.743 --> 02:07.955
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten,

02:08.093 --> 02:10.130
11...
You're counting too fast!

02:13.616 --> 02:15.894
Hi, Louise.
Oh, hi, Helen.
Come on in.

02:18.241 --> 02:20.070
What's that?
George.

02:20.209 --> 02:22.245
I dropped my wedding ring
down the sink.

02:22.383 --> 02:25.283
And George is so mad
he's hitting his head
against the wall?

02:27.250 --> 02:30.667
No, but he might as well,
as much as he knows
about plumbing.

02:33.118 --> 02:35.293
George, what
in the world...

02:35.431 --> 02:38.710
I gotta loosen up the pipe,
so I can unscrew with these.

02:38.848 --> 02:40.539
Those pliers won't
be much help.

02:40.677 --> 02:44.440
What you need
is a wrench.
What you need is a plumber.

02:44.578 --> 02:46.890
What I need is
some peace and quiet.

02:47.028 --> 02:49.272
Weezy, would you mind
moving to another room?

02:49.410 --> 02:51.516
And would you mind
moving to another city?

02:53.828 --> 02:55.175
George!

02:55.313 --> 02:57.142
My mother
dropped her ring
down the sink once,

02:57.280 --> 02:59.455
and my father got it out
with a clothes hanger.

03:00.041 --> 03:02.596
A clothes hanger? Oh!

03:02.734 --> 03:05.254
Okay, Weezy,
don't touch anything.
I'll be right back.

03:07.048 --> 03:09.050
I'd better call Maintenance.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.121
How'd you manage to drop
your ring down the sink?

03:11.260 --> 03:14.228
Well, I usually take it off
before I do the dishes,

03:14.366 --> 03:15.885
because it's loose.

03:16.023 --> 03:18.612
But I... Uh, yes...

03:18.750 --> 03:21.925
This is Louise Jefferson
in 12-D.

03:22.063 --> 03:24.307
I need to get a ring
out of my kitchen sink.

03:25.343 --> 03:27.690
What? Cleanser?

03:32.557 --> 03:35.594
Not that kind of ring,
it's my wedding ring.

03:36.768 --> 03:38.908
Yes. Okay, thanks.

03:39.702 --> 03:41.117
Would you like
some coffee?

03:41.255 --> 03:44.293
No, thanks. I just
dropped by to tell you
that it's official now.

03:44.431 --> 03:47.434
Tom has decided to go
into business for himself.

03:47.572 --> 03:50.299
Oh, that's great, Helen!

03:50.437 --> 03:53.302
He's down at the bank
right now arranging a loan.

03:53.647 --> 03:54.889
Oh!

03:55.027 --> 03:56.857
Guess what, George!

03:56.995 --> 03:58.824
Tom's starting
his own business.

03:58.962 --> 04:01.586
Oh, what's he gonna do?
Train zebras?

04:05.279 --> 04:08.178
He's opening his own
publishing house.

04:08.317 --> 04:09.525
Isn't that exciting?

04:09.801 --> 04:10.871
No.

04:12.907 --> 04:13.908
Damn it.

04:18.637 --> 04:20.708
Hey, how the hell
did your father do it?

04:23.228 --> 04:25.679
You're supposed
to straighten the
clothes hanger.

04:25.817 --> 04:27.301
Well, why didn't you
say that?

04:28.647 --> 04:30.131
Oh, I hope
that's Maintenance.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.237
Maintenance? Weezy,
why did you call them?

04:32.375 --> 04:34.308
Because I want my ring.

04:34.446 --> 04:35.585
I'm gonna get your ring.

04:35.723 --> 04:38.174
I hardly think you're
cut out for plumbing.

04:40.728 --> 04:42.316
I think Louise is wrong.

04:42.454 --> 04:43.938
Oh, you do, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.181
You're the
only one I know

04:45.319 --> 04:47.666
who can get
under the sink
without bending.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.158
Oh, Mr. Bentley,
it's you.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.884
Hi, Mrs. J.

04:59.022 --> 05:01.956
I'm preparing
a special stew for dinner
and I need some thyme.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.130
Would you?

05:03.268 --> 05:05.235
Oh, come in.
And I'll check
my spice rack.

05:05.374 --> 05:08.169
Hi, Mrs. Willis.
Hi, Mr. Bentley.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.137
Should I tell
Mr. Bentley the news?

05:10.275 --> 05:11.587
Oh, I've already heard.

05:11.725 --> 05:14.072
You did?
Yes. It's a shame,
isn't it?

05:14.210 --> 05:16.799
But I understand he'll be
out of the hospital
in a couple of days.

05:17.627 --> 05:19.249
Tom's in the hospital?

05:19.388 --> 05:21.804
Oh, my goodness, is he?

05:21.942 --> 05:25.394
So is Mr. Krebbs
in 10-C. That's who
I was talking about.

05:25.532 --> 05:27.465
But we were talking
about Tom Willis.

05:27.603 --> 05:28.604
Well, what's wrong with him?

05:28.742 --> 05:30.813
Nothing's wrong with him.

05:30.951 --> 05:32.573
Then why is he
in the hospital?

05:33.781 --> 05:35.576
He's not in
the hospital.

05:35.714 --> 05:37.613
Oh, but if something
is wrong with him,
he ought to be.

05:38.683 --> 05:41.479
Uh, we are getting a
little mixed up here.

05:41.617 --> 05:44.240
Uh, what did you hear
about Mr. Krebbs?

05:44.378 --> 05:45.552
He was standing
in front of the building

05:45.690 --> 05:47.243
when a car
backed over his foot.

05:47.795 --> 05:49.797
Oh, poor Mr. Krebbs.

05:49.935 --> 05:52.006
Yes, and poor Mrs. Krebbs.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.318
Well, what happened
to her?

05:53.456 --> 05:55.389
He punched her.
She was driving the car.

05:58.737 --> 06:00.808
Hey, Weezy, is that the guy...
Oh, Bentley, it's you.

06:00.946 --> 06:03.604
Hi, Mr. J. I came to see
if you had some thyme.

06:04.225 --> 06:05.779
Time for what?

06:06.262 --> 06:07.470
For my stew.

06:07.608 --> 06:10.439
No, thanks, Bentley.
I'm not hungry right now.

06:10.577 --> 06:14.443
Uh, George, Mr. Bentley is
talking about the kind of
herb you use for cooking.

06:14.581 --> 06:16.479
I'll go see if
we have some.

06:16.617 --> 06:19.586
This damn hanger
didn't work.
What a dumb idea.

06:19.724 --> 06:21.139
Oh, you're having
a problem?

06:21.277 --> 06:24.107
Louise dropped
her wedding ring
down the kitchen sink.

06:24.245 --> 06:26.282
Oh, dear me.
I've got a pipe wrench.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.663
Would you like me to go
and get it for you?

06:27.801 --> 06:29.492
Uh, yeah, Bentley.
That's just what I need.

06:29.630 --> 06:32.461
I'll be right back.
And I'm glad to hear
that Tom is feeling better.

06:32.599 --> 06:35.049
He was never sick.
He's starting
his own company.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.673
Oh, marvelous! He's going
to be an entrepreneur.

06:37.811 --> 06:39.571
No, he's gonna be
a publisher.

06:41.021 --> 06:45.128
Oh. Well, tell Mr. Willis
I said congratulations.

06:46.544 --> 06:49.374
So, he's gonna
quit his job and start
his own business, huh?

06:49.512 --> 06:52.964
Yes. He's been wanting
to start his own company
for a long time now,

06:53.102 --> 06:54.897
but he had to wait
until he found
a good book.

06:55.035 --> 06:57.140
Oh. Why didn't he
just go to the library?

06:59.315 --> 07:03.008
It's a manuscript
that Pelham and five other
publishers turned down.

07:03.146 --> 07:04.976
But Tom's sure
it's gonna be a hit.
Uh-huh.

07:05.114 --> 07:08.186
Well, I can tell you
one thing there ain't gonna
be no hit. Tom's business.

07:08.324 --> 07:10.499
George,
for your information,

07:10.637 --> 07:12.984
Tom has
a very detailed
business plan.

07:13.122 --> 07:15.987
He's gonna start
by specializing in those
how-to books.

07:16.125 --> 07:19.231
Oh! Maybe he can get
you a book on
how to pick a husband.

07:23.408 --> 07:25.065
Very funny!

07:25.203 --> 07:27.999
Or maybe you can
write a book for him on
how to be a nosy neighbor!

07:29.897 --> 07:33.038
Or maybe he could write
his own book on how to
be a honky pain in the...

07:33.176 --> 07:34.695
Listen, George!

07:37.215 --> 07:39.286
You don't need
a how-to book.

07:39.424 --> 07:41.288
You're a self-made idiot!

07:41.426 --> 07:42.876
You calling me an idiot?

07:43.014 --> 07:46.258
No. I'm calling you
a stupid little,
narrow-minded fool!

07:48.433 --> 07:49.572
Get out!

07:54.232 --> 07:55.958
The nerve of that woman!

07:56.096 --> 07:58.167
Look, Weezy, don't you
let that Helen Willis
in this apartment again

07:58.305 --> 07:59.996
until she apologizes to me.

08:00.134 --> 08:02.205
What did you do now?

08:02.343 --> 08:05.692
I didn't do nothin'.
She just ain't got
no sense of humor.

08:05.830 --> 08:07.797
Come on, George,
what did you say to Helen?

08:07.935 --> 08:10.179
Well, I just told her
I thought it was
wrong for Tom

08:10.317 --> 08:12.699
to be printing a book
that the other publishers
turned down.

08:12.837 --> 08:16.150
I mean, it's kind of dumb
taking something
nobody else wants.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.567
That's what everybody said
when I married you.

08:24.365 --> 08:27.748
See? I got a sense of humor.
I can appreciate a good joke.

08:28.646 --> 08:29.957
I wasn't joking.

08:42.314 --> 08:45.041
Oh, Tom!
When did you
get home?

08:45.179 --> 08:47.699
A few minutes ago.
Where were you?

08:50.391 --> 08:52.773
That George Jefferson
makes me so mad.

08:52.911 --> 08:54.568
Well, George makes
everybody mad.

08:54.706 --> 08:56.156
Here, I got some
champagne to celebrate.

08:56.294 --> 08:58.261
Good. I could use a drink.

08:58.399 --> 09:00.850
You know, it isn't
every wife who'd go
along with their husband

09:00.988 --> 09:04.198
when he decides to
quit his job and start
his own business.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.615
It's not every wife
who has a husband
as talented as you.

09:07.236 --> 09:08.478
True, true.

09:09.479 --> 09:10.895
Nor as modest as you.

09:12.275 --> 09:14.554
Well, here's to
the boss' wife.
I'll drink to that.

09:16.210 --> 09:19.282
Mmm. Let's have
a little music.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.462
Mrs. Boss,
may I have this dance?

09:27.325 --> 09:28.740
I'd love to.

09:32.744 --> 09:34.815
I guess you raised the money
for your company?

09:34.953 --> 09:37.577
Almost. All I have
to do is get a co-signer.

09:37.715 --> 09:38.785
Co-signer?

09:38.923 --> 09:40.027
Yes, the bank wouldn't
lend me the money

09:40.165 --> 09:41.926
because I didn't have
enough collateral.

09:42.064 --> 09:45.481
But they said
if I got a co-signer,
it would be no problem.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.345
But I thought that...
Don't worry, Helen.

09:47.483 --> 09:49.243
I have it
all figured out.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.592
That's good.
I'll just ask George.

09:52.730 --> 09:54.594
You what?
Oh, he won't mind.

09:55.733 --> 09:58.701
But I do. I think
the idea stinks.

09:58.839 --> 10:00.116
Oh, do you
have a better one?

10:00.254 --> 10:01.531
Why, yes.

10:01.670 --> 10:03.395
You can borrow the money
from my father.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.432
Your father?
Why, Helen, that's
out of the question.

10:05.570 --> 10:07.779
Why?
Because he hates me.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.643
But he's offered you
money before.

10:09.781 --> 10:12.370
Yes, he offered me $1,000
not to marry you.

10:14.199 --> 10:16.374
But, Tom?
No, no, no, I don't wanna
hear anymore about it!

10:16.512 --> 10:18.065
I will not crawl
to your father!

10:18.203 --> 10:20.689
No, you'd rather crawl
to George Jefferson!

10:20.827 --> 10:23.346
Oh, Daddy! Hi, I stopped
by to say congratulations.

10:23.484 --> 10:26.039
Thank you! I'm not
crawling to anyone!
What?

10:26.177 --> 10:29.283
Look, Tom, I do not
want you asking favors
of George Jefferson.

10:29.421 --> 10:32.804
Oh, come on, Helen.
You're acting as if George
were some kind of ogre.

10:32.942 --> 10:34.599
Well, he is.

10:34.737 --> 10:36.636
Why ever since we've
known him, he's done nothing
but call us names.

10:36.774 --> 10:38.051
Well, that's true.

10:38.189 --> 10:40.053
Well, that's just George.
He calls everybody names.

10:40.191 --> 10:41.537
That's true.

10:41.675 --> 10:45.196
He does not call everybody
Mr. and Mrs. Salt and Pepper.

10:47.129 --> 10:48.164
That's true.

10:49.096 --> 10:50.408
Jenny.

10:50.546 --> 10:53.411
Nor a dumb ugly
horse's behind.

10:53.549 --> 10:56.656
Oh, Helen, I'm sure
George was just
teasing you.

11:00.729 --> 11:03.007
Me? That's what
he called you.

11:04.077 --> 11:06.355
Me? Well, the little...

11:07.597 --> 11:10.152
Oh, well, I've been called
a lot worse than that.

11:11.153 --> 11:13.534
And he's always referring
to you as a honky.

11:14.604 --> 11:16.814
Well, uh, I am a honky.

11:19.437 --> 11:22.751
And he calls your own
daughter a zebra.
Helen!

11:22.889 --> 11:25.029
Hey, will somebody tell me
what's going on?

11:25.167 --> 11:27.100
I thought your father
had more pride

11:27.238 --> 11:29.723
than to borrow money
from a man like
George Jefferson!

11:29.861 --> 11:31.898
Look, what would you rather
have me do?

11:32.036 --> 11:34.555
Borrow the money from George,
or forget the whole business?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.040
Well...
Forget the whole business!

11:36.178 --> 11:38.145
Well, I'm not
gonna forget it,
so forget it!

11:38.283 --> 11:40.458
And if you want me, I'll be
downstairs talking to George.

11:40.596 --> 11:42.909
In that case,
you can forget about
talking to me!

11:43.047 --> 11:45.705
Well, that's fine with me,
because you're impossible
to talk to!

11:45.843 --> 11:46.878
Oh!

11:48.155 --> 11:51.365
Ah! I thought I was coming
over here to celebrate.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.919
You want to celebrate?

11:53.057 --> 11:55.576
Here, drink to your
father's new business.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.957
Foot kissing!

12:10.695 --> 12:13.353
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, George?

12:13.491 --> 12:15.182
Of course, I know
what I'm doing!

12:15.320 --> 12:17.564
That's what you said
on our honeymoon.

12:25.572 --> 12:28.161
Come on, you turkey!

12:28.299 --> 12:30.439
Get off of there!

12:41.588 --> 12:43.659
Oh, George,
what happened?

12:43.797 --> 12:45.350
Oh, I hurt my foot.
Give me a towel.

12:45.488 --> 12:46.558
Oh.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.527
Not for my foot,
for my shirt!

12:50.839 --> 12:52.633
You hurt your shirt?
Oh.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.428
What do you want, Willis?

12:54.566 --> 12:57.086
Oh, I understand
Helen told you about me
starting my own business.

12:57.224 --> 13:00.365
Oh, yeah, and we're
really happy for you, Tom.

13:00.503 --> 13:01.781
What are you
calling your company?

13:01.919 --> 13:03.403
Well, I'm naming it
after myself.

13:03.541 --> 13:04.784
Honky Publications.

13:04.922 --> 13:06.164
George!

13:06.302 --> 13:07.717
Get me a dry shirt!
Oh!

13:07.856 --> 13:09.892
Yes, master.

13:12.481 --> 13:14.794
Uh, George, may I have
a word with you?

13:14.932 --> 13:16.623
Sure. I hope it's goodbye.

13:20.144 --> 13:22.042
Oh, I just love your
sense of humor.

13:23.699 --> 13:26.598
But seriously,
George, you know,
I've always admired you

13:26.736 --> 13:28.152
for your, uh,
business abilities.

13:28.290 --> 13:29.567
Oh, you have?

13:29.705 --> 13:31.741
Sure. Well, just look at you.
You're a big success.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.329
Yeah, well...

13:33.467 --> 13:34.848
And you made it happen,
because you have
what it takes.

13:34.986 --> 13:36.505
You've got brains.

13:36.643 --> 13:38.645
No. Uh, I mean, yes.

13:38.783 --> 13:40.750
But more important,
you've got guts.

13:40.889 --> 13:42.752
That's right.
Because you're not afraid
to take a risk.

13:42.891 --> 13:44.651
That's right.

13:44.789 --> 13:46.515
Oh, you're not afraid to
give someone a helping hand
when he asks for it.

13:46.653 --> 13:47.896
Damn right.

13:48.034 --> 13:49.725
Oh, thanks, George!
I knew I could count on you!

13:49.863 --> 13:51.209
Oh boy!
Hey, hey...

13:51.347 --> 13:52.866
What's going on?

13:53.004 --> 13:54.903
George said he'd
co-sign for my loan.

13:55.041 --> 13:56.318
Well, you don't have
to get so...

13:56.801 --> 13:59.010
Loan? What loan?

13:59.148 --> 14:01.495
Well, the loan I need
to start my company. Here.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.704
All you have to do
is co-sign...

14:03.843 --> 14:05.706
No way.
What?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.156
Why should I co-sign
for somebody

14:07.294 --> 14:08.502
who comes to my house
and insults me?

14:09.124 --> 14:10.228
I didn't insult you.

14:10.366 --> 14:11.712
No, you didn't,
but your wife did.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.231
And until
she apologizes...

14:13.369 --> 14:15.026
Apologizes?

14:15.164 --> 14:17.166
George, you started
that argument with Helen.

14:17.304 --> 14:20.031
Right. And I'm finishing it.
Bye, Willis.

14:20.169 --> 14:22.620
George, I'm sure Helen
didn't mean what she said.

14:23.483 --> 14:24.898
What did she say?

14:25.036 --> 14:27.590
She called me a stupid
little, narrow-minded fool.

14:27.728 --> 14:29.006
Oh, yeah.

14:30.455 --> 14:31.801
I'm sure she's sorry.

14:33.010 --> 14:36.151
George, why don't you help
Tom get the money he needs?

14:36.289 --> 14:37.842
He's a responsible person.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.395
I know he's a
responsible person.

14:39.533 --> 14:41.846
That's why he's responsible
for what his wife said to me.

14:41.984 --> 14:46.713
Okay, George, if Helen
apologizes, will you
co-sign for the loan?

14:46.851 --> 14:50.682
Yeah, okay. If she comes down
and apologizes for calling me
a stupid narrow-minded fool.

14:50.820 --> 14:52.305
Stupid "little",
narrow-minded fool.

14:52.443 --> 14:55.170
What?
Oh, that's what she said.
Not me.

14:55.308 --> 14:57.620
Excuse me, Louise.
I have to go talk to Helen.

14:57.758 --> 14:58.725
Oh.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.521
George, I don't think
that's right.

15:01.659 --> 15:04.420
Look, Weezy,
this has got to be
the right pipe.

15:04.558 --> 15:08.148
I mean making
Helen apologize to you
before you co-sign.

15:08.286 --> 15:10.737
Look, Weezy, that's the way
business works.

15:10.875 --> 15:13.878
If somebody wants something
from you, they gotta pay
what you're asking.

15:14.016 --> 15:16.122
Oh, I think
I got it loose.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.641
Well, I don't think
it's right. And if I...

15:23.474 --> 15:25.096
Uh-oh.

15:30.101 --> 15:32.310
I'll have your ring for you
in a minute, Weezy.

15:32.448 --> 15:36.901
What? Oh. Uh, George,
maybe it's not in there.

15:37.039 --> 15:38.420
Say what?

15:38.558 --> 15:41.975
Uh, I'm not sure
I dropped it down
the drain.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.564
What the hell you mean
you're not sure?

15:46.324 --> 15:47.532
You were sure before.

15:47.670 --> 15:50.363
George, I wasn't sure.

15:50.501 --> 15:52.296
I could have left it
somewhere else.

15:52.434 --> 15:56.852
Or maybe I forgot and put it
in my apron before
I washed the dishes.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.130
Shucks, it could be anywhere.

15:59.268 --> 16:02.651
Oh, yeah? Well, I haven't
been breaking my tail just
anywhere for the last hour.

16:02.789 --> 16:05.309
If it ain't here, you're gonna
be putting this stuff back
together yourself.

16:05.447 --> 16:06.724
Oh, but, George...

16:06.862 --> 16:09.865
Oh, Weezy, I just about
got this drainpipe off.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.009
Hey, I got it.

16:17.631 --> 16:19.288
Oh! George!

16:24.949 --> 16:27.020
Oh, that's wonderful.

16:27.158 --> 16:29.333
I told you I knew
what I was doing. Ow!

16:32.784 --> 16:34.234
Helen, please.
No!

16:34.372 --> 16:36.409
But, Helen...
I said, no!

16:36.547 --> 16:38.894
Me apologize
to Little Big Mouth?
No way!

16:39.032 --> 16:40.516
But, Helen, we just
need his signature.

16:40.654 --> 16:42.380
We don't need a thing
from that turkey!

16:42.518 --> 16:44.313
Oh, come on, Helen.

16:44.451 --> 16:45.970
George isn't such a bad guy.

16:46.108 --> 16:47.627
Since when?

16:47.765 --> 16:49.939
Since Daddy found out
he needed a co-signer
for the loan.

16:52.597 --> 16:54.358
Oh, hi, Ralph.
Hello, Jenny.

16:54.496 --> 16:55.497
Come in.
Is, uh...

16:55.635 --> 16:57.568
Ah, there you
are, Mr. Willis, sir.

16:57.706 --> 16:59.190
This was just
delivered for you.

16:59.328 --> 17:01.641
Oh, my stationary!
Thanks, Ralph.

17:01.779 --> 17:04.644
Oh, look at that
letterhead, Jenny.
Pretty impressive, huh?

17:04.782 --> 17:07.336
"Thomas H. Willis
and Company."

17:07.474 --> 17:09.649
"Thomas H. Crawler
and Company."

17:11.789 --> 17:13.308
You bet
it's impressive, sir.

17:13.446 --> 17:16.483
And you can be sure
that I'll see that all
of your business mail

17:16.621 --> 17:19.176
will be delivered
right to you as soon
as it arrives.

17:19.314 --> 17:20.453
Thank you, Ralph.

17:23.525 --> 17:25.389
Of course,
if Mr. Whittendale

17:25.527 --> 17:28.944
should find out you're using
this address for a business,
he might not approve.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.152
Here, Ralph.

17:30.290 --> 17:32.051
Why, thank you,
Mr. Willis, sir.

17:33.155 --> 17:35.123
I'm sure Mr. Whittendale
will never find out.

17:35.261 --> 17:36.641
Fine.

17:36.779 --> 17:39.817
I just hope I'll be
able to show all of
your clients up here.

17:39.955 --> 17:42.406
You know, sometimes
I'm in other parts of
the building and...

17:42.544 --> 17:43.924
Ralph, if I keep
tipping you,

17:44.063 --> 17:46.410
I won't have enough money left
to start my business.

17:46.548 --> 17:50.172
Oh, yes, sir. No problem.
Good point. Well taken.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.140
Save some up.

17:53.382 --> 17:54.452
Good luck, sir.

17:57.006 --> 17:58.042
Now, Helen...

17:58.180 --> 17:59.906
Oh, Tom.

18:00.044 --> 18:02.357
I don't understand
how you can ask me
to do this.

18:02.495 --> 18:05.429
Can't you understand
how important starting
this company is for me?

18:05.567 --> 18:07.707
This is my big chance
to be my own man.

18:07.845 --> 18:11.055
Then be your own man!
But you won't be mine.

18:11.193 --> 18:12.539
Oh, Mama, you...

18:12.677 --> 18:14.990
Stay out of this, Jenny.
Don't talk to my
daughter like that.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.579
She can say
what she thinks.
Go on, Jenny.

18:19.167 --> 18:22.204
You and Daddy, you should
discuss this rationally.

18:22.342 --> 18:23.723
Right.

18:23.861 --> 18:26.243
I think Daddy is wrong...
Stay out of this, Jenny.

18:28.521 --> 18:30.454
The truth hurts,
doesn't it, Tom?

18:30.592 --> 18:32.835
You know, Helen,
you're being very small
about this.

18:32.973 --> 18:35.114
Me? You're the one
who's being small,

18:35.252 --> 18:37.323
asking me to tell George
I'm sorry.

18:37.461 --> 18:40.015
You don't have to mean it.
You just have to say it.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.637
Now you're asking me to lie?

18:41.775 --> 18:43.432
No, I'm telling
you to lie!

18:43.570 --> 18:45.020
Telling me?

18:45.158 --> 18:46.815
Well, now I'll
tell you something.

18:46.953 --> 18:47.919
What?

18:48.057 --> 18:49.024
Don't wait up for me.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.198
Where are you going?

18:50.336 --> 18:51.923
Out.
Out where?

18:52.061 --> 18:53.132
Out there!

18:53.270 --> 18:54.236
Helen!

18:55.168 --> 18:56.238
Damn!

18:56.376 --> 18:57.860
Daddy?
What do you want?

18:57.998 --> 18:59.483
Uh, telephone's for you.

19:00.277 --> 19:01.623
Hello. Who is this?

19:02.762 --> 19:05.109
Oh, hello, Larry.
How are things?

19:07.042 --> 19:08.043
What?

19:08.975 --> 19:10.977
Wait a minute.
I thought we had a deal.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.774
Well, yes, but... But wait...

19:16.810 --> 19:18.847
Yes, I understand.
Goodbye.

19:20.331 --> 19:21.367
What's wrong, Daddy?

19:21.505 --> 19:22.954
That was Larry Coleman.

19:23.092 --> 19:24.956
Oh, the author of your
first book, right?

19:25.094 --> 19:26.406
Wrong.

19:26.544 --> 19:28.063
It's not gonna be
my first book.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.375
You're not gonna publish it?

19:29.513 --> 19:31.515
No. Lafayette Publishing is.

19:31.653 --> 19:33.172
What, Lafayette Publishing?

19:33.310 --> 19:36.105
Yes. They read a copy
of the manuscript
and they loved it.

19:37.072 --> 19:38.729
They made Larry's agent
a huge offer

19:38.867 --> 19:39.833
and he accepted.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.181
Oh, what a fink!

19:42.319 --> 19:45.184
Yes. Some people will do
anything for money.

19:47.186 --> 19:52.329
Well, there goes "Thomas
H. Willis and Company."

19:52.467 --> 19:53.847
Oh, Daddy,
don't do that.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.401
Why? I won't be
needing this.

19:55.539 --> 19:57.817
Well, maybe not now,
but other books
will come along.

19:57.955 --> 19:59.301
You'll start
your own company
another time.

19:59.439 --> 20:01.130
But I was counting on
starting it now.

20:01.269 --> 20:03.340
I may never get
another chance like this!

20:03.478 --> 20:06.722
Daddy, yes you will.

20:07.344 --> 20:08.310
Oh.

20:09.794 --> 20:11.624
Hey, you remember
when I was little?

20:13.142 --> 20:16.732
One day you came home
from work all excited

20:16.870 --> 20:19.873
because you had seen a
beautiful house that was
for sale on Long Island.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.565
Oh, yeah.

20:21.703 --> 20:24.602
And you told the owner
that you'd bring
Mama back to see it.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.328
Oh, Jenny.

20:26.466 --> 20:28.813
And when the owner saw
that you and Mama
were a mixed couple,

20:28.951 --> 20:31.195
they changed their minds
about selling that house.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.992
I felt as if I had been
run over by a bulldozer.

20:35.130 --> 20:37.788
Mmm-hmm.
Well, just like now.

20:37.926 --> 20:41.964
But within two years we had
moved into a bigger house
in a better neighborhood.

20:43.966 --> 20:45.451
Message received.

20:48.005 --> 20:49.869
Thank you, Jenny.

20:50.007 --> 20:53.113
Oh, I better go tell
George to forget about
co-signing for the loan.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.012
And then I'm gonna look for
your mother.

20:55.150 --> 20:56.738
Well, I'll be
leaving soon, too.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.672
You're a good daughter, Jenny.

21:00.845 --> 21:02.261
Look who I take after.

21:03.227 --> 21:04.642
True. True.

21:09.751 --> 21:11.131
And I apologize
for calling you

21:11.270 --> 21:13.444
a stupid little,
narrow-minded fool.

21:13.582 --> 21:17.552
I apologize for calling you
a stupid little,
narrow-minded fool.

21:20.451 --> 21:22.557
Oh, I will start minding
my own business,

21:22.695 --> 21:25.456
and I promise to stop
being a nosy busybody.

21:25.594 --> 21:27.631
George!

21:27.769 --> 21:29.322
Oh, that's right, Weezy,
she can't help that.

21:31.117 --> 21:34.189
All right, here we go.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.743
Now your big fat husband
can get his big fat loan.

21:37.744 --> 21:39.332
Thank you, George.
Happy to do it.

21:41.127 --> 21:42.818
Oh, hi, Tom.
Hi, Louise.

21:42.956 --> 21:45.200
Why, Helen, what
are you doing here?

21:45.338 --> 21:50.343
Well, I thought about it,
and I decided to come down
and apologize to George.

21:50.481 --> 21:53.242
Here, Tom. Good luck
with your new business.

21:53.381 --> 21:55.693
No, Helen,
I can't accept it.
But, Tom, you...

21:55.831 --> 21:58.386
And furthermore, you
shouldn't have apologized
to George.

21:58.524 --> 22:01.043
What? You told me...
Never apologize
when you're right.

22:01.181 --> 22:04.253
Right? She called me
a stupid little,
narrow-minded fool!

22:04.737 --> 22:05.876
Well?
Listen...

22:07.049 --> 22:10.121
And I don't need a fool
to help me start my business!

22:12.400 --> 22:15.264
Oh, Tom, that business means
so much to you.

22:15.403 --> 22:17.646
But, Helen, what kind of man
do you think I am?

22:20.062 --> 22:21.823
A wonderful man.

22:21.961 --> 22:24.653
Oh, thank you. But after all,
what kind of man

22:24.791 --> 22:27.104
would put his business
before his marriage?

22:27.242 --> 22:30.279
One, about five-foot-six
and 140 pounds.

22:32.627 --> 22:33.697
Oh, Tom...

22:34.594 --> 22:35.940
Oh, hello.

22:36.078 --> 22:37.701
Oh, hello, Jenny.

22:38.529 --> 22:40.600
Oh, that fight
didn't last long.

22:40.738 --> 22:45.502
Oh... That's because
I'm married to such
a sweet man.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.090
Yes, and a
brave one.
Well...

22:48.228 --> 22:49.782
He didn't even cry
when he found out

22:49.920 --> 22:51.300
his book deal
fell through.

22:57.272 --> 22:58.722
Fell through?
Uh-huh.

22:58.860 --> 23:01.069
Oh, didn't you
hear about it?
That Mr. Coleman...

23:01.207 --> 23:04.452
Uh, Jenny, dear, don't you
think you'd better be going?
It's getting late.

23:04.590 --> 23:06.730
No, it's only
about 5:30.

23:06.868 --> 23:08.663
Well, I know.
But you look a little pale.

23:08.801 --> 23:10.872
Of course she does,
she's your daughter.

23:13.495 --> 23:15.635
Goodbye, Jenny.
Oh, well, uh, goodnight.

23:16.498 --> 23:18.604
So the deal fell through, huh?

23:18.742 --> 23:20.606
Now, Helen, let me explain.
You see...

23:20.744 --> 23:22.470
And you were doing it
just for me, huh?

23:22.608 --> 23:24.023
No. I, I mean, yes.
What do you mean...

23:24.161 --> 23:25.818
Yes! Wait, wait...
I can explain.

23:25.956 --> 23:27.302
I'm down here and
apologize to this man,

23:27.440 --> 23:28.786
when all the time you knew...
Let's go out here.

23:28.924 --> 23:31.513
...that you had not had any
deal in the first place, Tom!

23:31.651 --> 23:34.654
Ahem. Ahem, Mrs. J.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.243
I just wanted
to return this.

23:37.381 --> 23:39.763
Oh, you didn't have to
bring it back so soon.

23:39.901 --> 23:42.662
Oh, yes, I did. I don't like
living on borrowed thyme.

23:45.907 --> 23:47.909
I'll get your pipe wrench
for you.

23:48.047 --> 23:50.567
Thank you. Did Mr. J get
your ring out of the sink?

23:50.705 --> 23:53.086
Oh, it wasn't in the sink,
it was in my apron.

23:54.363 --> 23:55.468
Apron?

23:59.265 --> 24:00.956
You mean to tell me
you didn't have no ring
in the sink?

24:01.094 --> 24:02.371
Look George, let me...

24:11.104 --> 24:15.488
I love you truly
