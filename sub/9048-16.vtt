- No, I totally know that.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.068
- Who are you?

09:08.070 --> 09:09.436
- I'm Lissa.

09:09.438 --> 09:12.238
You've met me,
like, so many times.

09:12.240 --> 09:15.241
- You look like
you need a drink.

09:15.243 --> 09:17.110
- I think I need some advice.

09:17.112 --> 09:19.212
- From me?

09:19.214 --> 09:21.881
You need advice from me?

09:21.883 --> 09:23.383
- Tamara found out
I never told her

09:23.385 --> 09:25.085
about hooking up with this guy
that she likes,

09:25.087 --> 09:26.386
so I said that
she should have him

09:26.388 --> 09:27.754
and then she flipped out on me.

09:27.756 --> 09:29.489
- Ouch.
- Well, I told her the truth.

09:29.491 --> 09:31.891
- You also told her
that she could have the guy

09:31.893 --> 09:33.993
you were done with.
Okay, quick story.

09:33.995 --> 09:35.362
When your father and I
were dating,

09:35.364 --> 09:37.130
we broke up several times,

09:37.132 --> 09:40.333
but the makeup sex
was always so--

09:40.335 --> 09:41.234
- Mom.
- Anyway,

09:41.236 --> 09:43.536
to teach him a lesson
during one of the breakups,

09:43.538 --> 09:45.038
I went out with his friend,
Paul.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.007
When we got back together,
I told him I hung out with Paul.

09:48.009 --> 09:52.846
I did not tell him that
Paul tried to go all the way.

09:52.848 --> 09:55.281
- So I should have told Tamara
about Owen,

09:55.283 --> 09:56.216
just not the details?

09:56.218 --> 09:59.219
- Sometimes you tell
just enough of the truth

09:59.221 --> 10:00.253
to spare people the hurt.

10:00.255 --> 10:04.023
- Hmm, that story was
actually really relevant.

10:04.025 --> 10:05.925
Thanks, Mom.
- Hmm.

10:05.927 --> 10:07.327
- Wait, was any of that
even true?

10:07.329 --> 10:11.731
- Oh, honey, you feel better.
Does it really matter?

10:12.900 --> 10:15.969
- Gabby, if you drop Matty now,
no one will ever know

10:15.971 --> 10:19.139
we were at this astroturf
kiddie dumping ground.

10:19.141 --> 10:22.342
- Just no one
instagram anything.

10:22.344 --> 10:25.078
Hey, maybe we should split up
into teams.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.013
Little friendly competition?

10:27.015 --> 10:29.182
- That's kind of unfair,
don't you think?

10:29.184 --> 10:31.885
I mean, we're both athletes
and they're...

10:31.887 --> 10:33.386
- Finish that thought, Mijo.

10:33.388 --> 10:36.222
- Oh, no. It's now
my new mission in life

10:36.224 --> 10:39.926
to destroy you at mini golf.

10:44.765 --> 10:47.200
[Knock at door]

10:49.203 --> 10:50.203
- Evenin', ma'am.

10:50.205 --> 10:52.071
I'm here to check out
your plumbing.

10:52.073 --> 10:53.173
- Jake, are you...

10:53.175 --> 10:55.442
Oh, God, is this supposed to
be sexy or something?

10:55.444 --> 10:57.510
- Well, my customers usually
aren't this forward,

10:57.512 --> 11:00.146
but if that's what you're
looking for, I'm good to go.

11:00.148 --> 11:02.215
- Okay, stop saying things
and come inside.

11:02.217 --> 11:06.352
- I'm just trying to give you
a taste of the bad boy.

11:06.354 --> 11:07.153
- Okay?

11:07.155 --> 11:08.588
But you're not a bad boy.

11:08.590 --> 11:12.091
- Ugh, not even here?
I can't win.

11:12.093 --> 11:13.126
No matter how hard I try,

11:13.128 --> 11:14.461
whether I'm the clean-cut
class president

11:14.463 --> 11:18.331
or a serious musician
or a studly plumber,

11:18.333 --> 11:21.301
I just keep getting
the cutesy bull[Bleep]

11:21.303 --> 11:26.172
Like #puppylove
or #takehometomommy.

11:26.174 --> 11:27.507
I want to be
#hititandquitit.

11:27.509 --> 11:31.277
- Aw, you're just not
douchey enough for that,

11:31.279 --> 11:32.545
which is a good thing.

11:32.547 --> 11:36.249
Because when you learn to be
comfortable with who you are,

11:36.251 --> 11:37.283
it won't matter

11:37.285 --> 11:39.252
if you're wearing
a varsity jacket or a guitar

11:39.254 --> 11:44.090
or a plumber's outfit you saw
in a bad '80s porn.

11:45.392 --> 11:48.094
- Are you sure you don't want me
to check your pipes

11:48.096 --> 11:52.799
before I burn
this ridiculous getup?

11:58.472 --> 12:02.842
- Ah, screw it,
a quick snaking couldn't hurt.

12:05.412 --> 12:07.647
- Oh! Nice.

12:07.649 --> 12:09.449
- It's all in the wrist.

12:09.451 --> 12:11.584
Okay, just like here.

12:11.586 --> 12:14.487
- Oh, my, coach.
Hands.

12:14.489 --> 12:18.057
- Focus, McKibben.
- Got it.

12:18.059 --> 12:20.126
Hole in one.

12:20.561 --> 12:22.729
- Yeah!
- [Sighs]

12:22.731 --> 12:24.330
- All right,
you're up, Sergio.

12:24.332 --> 12:27.200
Miss this,
and I will rip off your [Bleep]!

12:27.202 --> 12:30.103
- That only hurts you, babe.

12:30.105 --> 12:33.273
- [Coughs]

12:33.774 --> 12:36.109
- Ha! Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

12:39.213 --> 12:41.314
- Hmm?

12:41.316 --> 12:42.715
- All right.
Okay, okay.

12:42.717 --> 12:45.618
I admit, I am
the worst mini golfer here.

12:45.620 --> 12:48.488
But how about this--
I make this here putt,

12:48.490 --> 12:50.290
and you kiss me tonight?

12:50.292 --> 12:52.559
- If you make this putt,
I'll die of shock,

12:52.561 --> 12:54.561
so you'll be kissing
a corpse.

12:54.563 --> 12:58.097
- Oh, I will take that
as a yes.

13:01.769 --> 13:04.070
Oh!
- Oh! Whoa! Nice!

13:04.072 --> 13:05.271
Yeah!
- No!

13:05.273 --> 13:08.341
- So when a hookup is on
the line, suddenly you can play?

13:08.343 --> 13:10.643
- Well, it's a classic way
to step up the game.

13:10.645 --> 13:15.915
- I think "game" is
the operative word here, player.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.451
- Okay.

13:18.453 --> 13:20.620
What did I do?
- Don't feel bad.

13:20.622 --> 13:24.490
Maybe mini golf
just isn't an athlete's game.

13:24.492 --> 13:26.492
- [Laughs]

13:29.463 --> 13:31.397
- When I don't answer my phone,

13:31.399 --> 13:34.000
it's 'cause I don't want
to talk to you.

13:34.002 --> 13:35.335
- Just wait.

13:35.337 --> 13:36.703
I was a jerk
about the Owen situation

13:36.705 --> 13:40.006
and definitely said
some wrong things.

13:40.008 --> 13:40.673
- Go on.

13:40.675 --> 13:42.342
- I should have told you
about Owen sooner.

13:42.344 --> 13:44.510
I shouldn't have told you
about the virginity thing

13:44.512 --> 13:45.745
or said that he was
hung up on me,

13:45.747 --> 13:47.013
which clearly isn't the case,

13:47.015 --> 13:48.915
since he immediately went
and hooked up with you.

13:48.917 --> 13:49.716
I made it all about me.

13:49.718 --> 13:53.219
- Because you think the whole
world revolves around you.

13:53.221 --> 13:55.254
- Okay, jeez, I am trying
to apologize.

13:55.256 --> 13:57.657
- Apology declined.
Hi, Owen.

13:57.659 --> 13:59.359
- Owen, what are you doing here?

13:59.361 --> 14:00.560
- Uh, drinking juice.

14:00.562 --> 14:03.363
- I invited him. Oh,
and he told me what you said,

14:03.365 --> 14:06.466
about how you think
he's using me to hurt you!

14:06.468 --> 14:07.667
Again, it's not all about you!

14:07.669 --> 14:09.235
- Owen, I can't believe
you told her that.

14:09.237 --> 14:12.405
- I was yelling at him
for not telling me about you

14:12.407 --> 14:13.339
in the first place,

14:13.341 --> 14:16.075
and he terror-spilled it
out of fear for his young life.

14:16.077 --> 14:17.377
So turn your outrage
back over here.

14:17.379 --> 14:20.580
- Tamara, chill. I am trying
to make things better.

14:20.582 --> 14:21.648
- By keeping more secrets?

14:21.650 --> 14:24.217
By assuming Owen
wouldn't want me for me?

14:24.219 --> 14:26.686
You still don't get it.
It's not even about Owen.

14:26.688 --> 14:29.088
- It's not?
- Owen, be quiet.

14:29.090 --> 14:31.257
Jenna, this is all about
you and me.

14:31.259 --> 14:32.158
- You and me?

14:32.160 --> 14:34.260
- Actually,
it's mostly just about you.

14:34.262 --> 14:37.664
We're having juice now.
'Kay, thanks, bye!

14:40.367 --> 14:42.068
- Don't get in the backseat,
Gabby.

14:42.070 --> 14:43.503
His putter doesn't work right!

14:43.505 --> 14:46.472
- Yeah, not exactly
good winners, huh?

14:46.474 --> 14:47.573
Well, then again,

14:47.575 --> 14:51.110
you're not exactly the--the best
loser I've ever seen either.

14:51.112 --> 14:54.714
- Being competitive got me
a full ride to Stanford.

14:54.716 --> 14:56.516
- Okay, you know what?
I-I give up.

14:56.518 --> 14:57.617
So, actually, you win.

14:57.619 --> 15:00.420
- Maybe that's your problem,
McKibben.

15:00.422 --> 15:04.390
Things come so easy to you,
you can't handle a challenge.

15:04.392 --> 15:06.092
- You don't know me.

15:06.094 --> 15:08.294
This is the first time
we have interacted,

15:08.296 --> 15:11.631
yet you seem to be an expert
on--on who I am?

15:12.566 --> 15:15.134
- I know you've been trying
way too hard

15:15.136 --> 15:16.402
to convince me
you're a good guy.

15:16.404 --> 15:17.537
- Did it ever occur to you that

15:17.539 --> 15:19.706
it might be
because I like you?

15:19.708 --> 15:21.641
If you're so up for challenges,
Gabby,

15:21.643 --> 15:23.543
why don't you challenge
yourself?

15:23.545 --> 15:26.179
Get to know me,
instead of doing the easy thing

15:26.181 --> 15:27.747
and--and icing me out
because you believe

15:27.749 --> 15:30.183
a bunch of stupid hashtags
and rumors.

15:30.185 --> 15:33.319
You seem better than that.

15:34.121 --> 15:38.057
Any of this getting through?

15:39.326 --> 15:41.060
Score!

15:41.062 --> 15:41.694
I'm kidding.

15:41.696 --> 15:43.629
- You know that whole
"you're better than that" thing

15:43.631 --> 15:45.231
is the only thing
that's getting to me, right?

15:45.233 --> 15:49.368
- Yeah. Why do you think
I saved it for last?

15:52.339 --> 15:54.073
- The more I tried
to do the right thing,

15:54.075 --> 15:56.609
the worse things got.
[Cell phone alert chiming]

15:56.611 --> 15:58.578
Tamara and I weren't
the only ones having friction.

15:58.580 --> 16:02.615
The dude database was
rubbing everyone the wrong way.

16:04.051 --> 16:05.451
Nice to see a friendly face.

16:05.453 --> 16:07.386
- Absolutely.
The friendliest face.

16:07.388 --> 16:10.423
These ladies have
no [Bleep] idea.

16:10.425 --> 16:11.290
- Okay?

16:11.292 --> 16:13.726
- Stop! Dead in your tracks.
Attention, seniors.

16:13.728 --> 16:18.197
Do you find yourself friendless
and alienated from everyone?

16:18.199 --> 16:19.665
Come to the club room
in five minutes

16:19.667 --> 16:24.270
to find out how to
stop being awful people.

16:24.272 --> 16:24.771
Mandatory!

16:24.773 --> 16:28.174
There is a lot of hate in here.
And I get it.

16:28.176 --> 16:30.143
I can see why
some of you hate each other.

16:30.145 --> 16:31.444
I hate some of you, too.

16:31.446 --> 16:33.546
I mean, sometimes when you
come into my office

16:33.548 --> 16:36.282
with your whining,
I want to kill myself.

16:36.284 --> 16:40.453
But welcome to
Val's "ur the change"!

16:40.455 --> 16:43.589
The "you're" is spelled u-r.

16:43.591 --> 16:48.161
Let's get all that hate
out in the open. Go!

16:48.163 --> 16:50.296
- I could go first, Val.

16:50.298 --> 16:53.266
- Oh, what a good attitude,
Sadie.

16:53.268 --> 16:54.200
Don't edit yourself.

16:54.202 --> 16:56.369
We can all take it,
right, everyone?

16:56.371 --> 16:59.505
Huh?

16:59.507 --> 17:00.706
- I hate...

17:00.708 --> 17:03.509
This lame exercise
you're forcing on us.

17:03.511 --> 17:06.746
You're a fake teacher
and should be fired again

17:06.748 --> 17:10.183
or thrown in jail
for gross negligence.

17:10.185 --> 17:13.252
Do us all a favor
and self-deport

17:13.254 --> 17:14.420
to whatever nowhere country

17:14.422 --> 17:18.691
gave you your 3-easy-steps
online degree in counseling

17:18.693 --> 17:21.160
and demand a refund.

17:21.162 --> 17:22.395
You're welcome.

17:22.397 --> 17:27.266
Wow! I do feel better.

17:29.269 --> 17:30.136
- Next!

17:30.138 --> 17:33.406
- I hate that all you most
base level of basic bitches

17:33.408 --> 17:36.742
need infantile bonding exercises
to process your [Bleep].

17:36.744 --> 17:39.312
Grow a pair.
- Preach!

17:39.314 --> 17:43.216
- I hate that--that--

17:43.218 --> 17:46.285
that God is an [Bleep]!

17:49.323 --> 17:50.489
- Isn't God the worst?

17:50.491 --> 17:55.728
- I hate that gummy worms
won't tell me their secrets.

17:55.730 --> 17:56.529
No faces.

17:56.531 --> 17:58.364
- I hate this.
It's weird.

17:58.366 --> 18:01.400
And, well, I'd rather be doing
anything else.

18:01.402 --> 18:05.571
- Except maybe
playing mini golf?

18:05.573 --> 18:06.305
[Snorts]

18:06.307 --> 18:08.274
- I don't hate anything.

18:08.276 --> 18:12.378
I guess I'm just a nice guy
that way.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.180
- I hate when my best friend

18:14.182 --> 18:15.548
doesn't tell me
huge things in her life,

18:15.550 --> 18:19.318
and then throws me her sloppy
seconds like it's a favor.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.853
- And I hate when you can't see

18:20.855 --> 18:22.788
that I am sincerely
trying to help!

18:22.790 --> 18:24.290
- I hate that you can't see

18:24.292 --> 18:25.691
that I'm not always
second best!

18:25.693 --> 18:28.294
- I hate that you think
you're second best.

18:28.296 --> 18:29.395
I mean, you're so organized,

18:29.397 --> 18:30.763
and--and you have
your [Bleep] together,

18:30.765 --> 18:33.332
and you don't exist in this
constant state of teen angst.

18:33.334 --> 18:35.701
- Well, I hate
that you don't see

18:35.703 --> 18:37.503
that you're the kind
of relaxed cool

18:37.505 --> 18:40.439
that I will never relax enough
to be.

18:40.441 --> 18:42.608
All the guys flock to you
and...

18:42.610 --> 18:44.777
[Scoffs]
I'm jealous.

18:44.779 --> 18:47.847
- T., you're gorgeous.
You got into college.

18:47.849 --> 18:49.882
You're about to take control
of your future.

18:49.884 --> 18:52.852
You're amazing.
- Thank you for saying that.

18:52.854 --> 18:55.755
Was that so hard?
You're amazing, too.

18:55.757 --> 18:59.659
- You know what,
clearly, this isn't working.

18:59.661 --> 19:02.395
I'm guessing
it's your fault.

19:02.397 --> 19:04.597
I'm just gonna throw in
the puberty video

19:04.599 --> 19:07.566
and pretend like this
never happened.

19:12.439 --> 19:14.073
- After Tamara and I
very publicly cleared the air,

19:14.075 --> 19:15.641
we still needed
to anonymously atone

19:15.643 --> 19:18.277
for our anonymous
dude database drama.

19:18.279 --> 19:19.545
So we decided to add
positive hashtags

19:19.547 --> 19:22.281
to level the playing field.
- What about Kyle?

19:22.283 --> 19:25.718
He's a tough one.
- #emostud?

19:25.720 --> 19:29.655
Oh, #secrettigerinbed!

19:29.657 --> 19:33.392
[Cell phone alerts chiming]

19:39.499 --> 19:42.568
- Owen!
Hey, come here for a sec.

19:42.570 --> 19:44.236
- Jenna, Tamara,

19:44.238 --> 19:46.605
looks like you guys
are getting along.

19:46.607 --> 19:47.873
- You stepped into
some heavy drama

19:47.875 --> 19:50.443
that was not of your making,
and we're sorry.

19:50.445 --> 19:53.746
I just hope this didn't
fully scar you or anything.

19:53.748 --> 19:57.450
- Are you kidding?
Two senior girls in two weeks.

19:57.452 --> 20:01.587
I'm basically a legend.
I mean, you don't even know.

20:02.889 --> 20:05.324
- Ugh.
He's so #adorablygoofy.

20:05.326 --> 20:07.760
Is it tragic
that I still want some?

20:07.762 --> 20:10.629
- Yes!
- J.K., I'm done.

20:11.365 --> 20:13.265
- Hey, I thought you said
we couldn't delete

20:13.267 --> 20:14.266
this stupid database?

20:14.268 --> 20:16.268
- Jenna, please.
You can't delete it.

20:16.270 --> 20:17.536
- Too late, I already did.

20:17.538 --> 20:19.972
- No! Jenna, I didn't mean
you can't delete it!

20:19.974 --> 20:22.141
I mean don't
[Bleep] delete it!

20:22.143 --> 20:25.511
[Cell phone alerts chiming]

20:31.084 --> 20:34.253
- Holy [Bleep].

20:35.722 --> 20:36.756
- Next on <i>Awkward...</i>

20:36.758 --> 20:38.424
- It's like a dating dust bowl
out here.

20:38.426 --> 20:40.493
I'm gonna have to cancel
the Valentine's dance!

20:40.495 --> 20:41.160
Ouch.

20:41.162 --> 20:42.495
- The whole school
wants to kill me

20:42.497 --> 20:43.596
and all you can say is "ouch"?

20:43.598 --> 20:45.398
It is your fault that
the rankings went viral,

20:45.400 --> 20:46.799
yet I continue
to take all the hits.

20:46.801 --> 20:50.503
I'm just gonna have to save
Valentine's Day by myself.

20:50.505 --> 20:52.338
I rented us a party bus.

20:52.340 --> 20:53.272
[Groaning]

20:53.274 --> 20:55.174
Holla, party people.
