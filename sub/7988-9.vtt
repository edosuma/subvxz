00:02.961 --> 00:04.759
MR. KEEN: My report on the
Chris's foreign interests, sir.

00:04.922 --> 00:07.721
Surprising developments
in the far east.

00:07.883 --> 00:10.557
Tensions in the United States.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.231
Good.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.939
My report on our British
interests, Mr. Donoghue.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.819
I completed it early.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.275
Have to be vigilant.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.156
Can't ignore the storm clouds
rolling in from America.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.568
Fresh warnings
from the Federal Reserve.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.702
Wasn't there cause for concern
with Selfridge?

00:27.861 --> 00:28.908
Is that company in hand?

00:29.071 --> 00:30.288
Yes.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.073
We're kept fully apprised
of all developments.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.744
I work from there
two days a week.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.083
Not much here about his
involvement in Whiteley's?

00:37.246 --> 00:39.669
Doesn't interfere with his
stewardship of Selfridge's.

00:39.831 --> 00:43.586
Man seems to have more hours
in his day than the rest of us.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.175
Make sure you're not
blindsided, Keen.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.511
Never drop your guard.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.254
(birds chirping)

01:27.421 --> 01:28.388
HARRY:
Pull!

01:31.508 --> 01:31.929
(gunshot)

01:35.971 --> 01:37.894
A landmark anniversary
is coming up at Selfridge's.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.979
20 years since
we opened our doors.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.485
Congratulations.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.020
You must be so proud.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.484
It's been a troubling year.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.320
I need to feel proud again.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.318
Pull!

01:51.486 --> 01:52.453
(gunshot)

01:52.613 --> 01:55.412
I can't imagine
what you're planning.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.372
A huge public spectacle.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.707
We hope to take over
all of Oxford Street.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.372
I'm thinking that big.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.337
Now that Whiteley's
is on an even keel,

02:04.499 --> 02:06.376
I need to leave it
in your hands for a while.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.638
That way, I can fully
concentrate on the anniversary.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.264
Whatever you need, Harry.

02:13.759 --> 02:14.806
Ah, Mae.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.766
I never see you
these days,

02:16.928 --> 02:20.808
and the topic has to be
Harry Selfridge?

02:20.974 --> 02:24.524
I thought I'd come
straight to the top.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.359
It's your reporter, Wynnstay.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.068
Oh, he's being a pest.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.108
Not to you, surely?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.369
Oh yes, to me
and anyone to do with Harry.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.871
He's trying to undermine
Harry's business partner.

02:35.030 --> 02:38.409
He thought that Indian chappie
got a bit hot around the collar

02:38.575 --> 02:40.953
at the mention
of Colleano.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.963
Mr. Dillon was out of town
with his mother

02:44.122 --> 02:46.545
the night that
Mr. Colleano died.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.087
Call your dog off.

02:50.253 --> 02:55.225
I'm not sure I like being told
what to do, Mae.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.136
Oh, all right, then.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.679
Continue and at best,

02:58.845 --> 03:01.143
you'll end up looking a fool,
and at worst,

03:01.306 --> 03:03.729
in a courtroom for slander.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.149
You seem to care a lot
for Harry Selfridge.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.695
He's my boss.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.740
MISS MARDLE: Ernest, remember
you have games this afternoon.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.704
And for lunch,

03:19.866 --> 03:23.040
home-baked cold chicken pies,
raw carrot, and tomato.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.750
Can I have cheese and pickle?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.256
Father didn't mind.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.712
We know about
vitamins now, Ernest.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.217
You eat your vegetables,
there's an apple for after.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.719
But Father said...

03:30.877 --> 03:33.596
You must've been up
since the crack of dawn

03:33.755 --> 03:34.802
to get all this ready.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.967
5:00.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.728
Right, everyone,
shoes polished?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.183
Let's exit
in an orderly fashion.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.616
Have a good day, Meryl.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.878
I won't let you down, Roger.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.214
Stock selling is
a good thing, surely?

04:12.377 --> 04:13.879
Just it's faster than
we ever anticipated.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.592
What are you saying?

04:15.756 --> 04:18.976
There've been miscalculations
about the sales forecasts.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.478
We're new
to the retail business.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.559
Picked up a lot
in a very short time.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.601
We haven't balanced sales
against the flow of stock.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.940
You know I don't have time

04:29.102 --> 04:30.524
to study these figures
in detail.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.281
You should have, because now
we're running out of stock.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.067
Right.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.906
And we have no means
of purchasing new goods

04:37.068 --> 04:39.196
until the suppliers'
embargo is lifted.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.784
Yes, and it will be--
we're seeing the chairman

04:40.947 --> 04:42.415
of the British Wholesalers'
Association today.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.793
And how long before they
offer us credit again?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.124
I'll push as hard <i>as</i> I can.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.584
You'll have to close the doors

04:48.747 --> 04:51.466
if we can't restock
within three days.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.471
We keep this
between ourselves.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.011
You need to tell
Mr. Selfridge.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.099
(loud bang)

05:05.430 --> 05:07.899
You do as I damn well tell you.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.311
I can't let
Mr. Selfridge down.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.399
Leave this with me.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.288
Where is she?

05:21.446 --> 05:23.073
Well, this isn't
a very good start, is it?

05:23.240 --> 05:24.162
(Sighs)

05:27.953 --> 05:30.047
Mrs. Towler,
isn't your replacement

05:30.205 --> 05:32.082
due to start with us
this morning?

05:32.249 --> 05:34.502
Miss Blight
hasn't arrived.

05:34.668 --> 05:38.343
Oh, late
on her first day?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.678
She needn't bother
turning up.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.351
(Sighs)

05:46.513 --> 05:47.981
So, where does this
leave me, eh?

05:48.139 --> 05:50.233
I should be
out of here in days.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.033
Which color do you prefer,
Madame Rennard?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.614
Oh, the red,
definitely the red.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.029
It's a much
stronger contrast.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.242
Good Morning,
Mr. Selfridge.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.247
Good morning, Chief.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.498
Morning, sir.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.000
Good morning, sir.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.959
The council
has said yes!

06:12.122 --> 06:14.295
(applause)

06:14.457 --> 06:16.505
We get our 20th
anniversary parade!

06:20.088 --> 06:21.340
I can't think
of no finer tribute

06:21.506 --> 06:22.507
to all of our loyal customers.

06:22.674 --> 06:23.721
Finally, we get to put
into place

06:23.884 --> 06:25.511
everything
we've been planning.

06:25.677 --> 06:26.894
There'll be special offers
and promotions

06:27.053 --> 06:28.054
throughout the store.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.347
Mr. Lyons,

06:29.514 --> 06:31.232
where are we
with the performers?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.691
Oh, we've got acrobats,
jugglers, dancers, magicians.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.605
We'll even have floats!

06:36.771 --> 06:38.023
Mr. Towler?

06:38.189 --> 06:40.032
Everything starts
at Marble Arch.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.865
Traffic will be closed off
for the day.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.076
Police manning pavements
either sides of the road.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.490
Crowds along here and here.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.158
The parade moves
down Oxford Street

06:48.325 --> 06:50.248
to the store.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.128
CRABB:
What a spectacle!

06:52.287 --> 06:55.416
This will be splashed
on newspapers across the world.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.051
Who's in charge
of sunshine?

06:58.209 --> 06:59.301
(laughter)

07:00.462 --> 07:02.339
Madame Rennard?

07:02.505 --> 07:04.724
Right, well, my ladies

07:04.883 --> 07:08.604
are currently making thousands
of gift rosettes

07:08.762 --> 07:10.514
bearing the slogan
"20 years at Selfridge's".

07:10.680 --> 07:12.933
Your own fine idea.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.481
These celebrations
will show the public,

07:18.647 --> 07:21.446
dare I say the world,
how far we've come

07:21.608 --> 07:22.985
and how far
we mean to go.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.280
Mr. Dillon is here
to see how we do things.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.323
Please welcome him.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.537
Thank you.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.417
I hope to pick up some tips

07:31.576 --> 07:32.953
from the world's
best store

07:33.119 --> 07:36.419
so if anything goes wrong,
I'll know what to do.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.503
(laughter)

07:37.666 --> 07:38.838
GORDON:
That's it, folks.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.378
From this moment on,
we're in full showtime mode.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.466
Thank you all
very much.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.346
Madame Rennard.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.433
It seems that the head
of Fashion has let us down.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.847
Yes.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.061
We'll need to make a plan.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.817
JIMMY:
Pretty impressive.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.399
You'll have your work cut out
to top that at Whiteley's.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.813
Jimmy Dillon
will think of something

07:59.980 --> 08:01.357
when the time comes.

08:01.523 --> 08:06.029
A lot to learn before any major
Whiteley's anniversaries.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.322
It's more complex than
a person might think,

08:08.488 --> 08:10.115
this retail business.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.955
No one could have picked it up
<i>as</i> quickly <i>as</i> you.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.961
My father and I really
are grateful, Jimmy.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.095
I don't much rate
the Swan and Edgar applicant,

08:23.253 --> 08:25.802
but I'll call her in anyway,
I think.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.513
Why have you been
avoiding me, Mae?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.056
I'm not avoiding you.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.265
I'm not blind.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.727
Ever since we spent
the night together...

08:34.889 --> 08:37.859
It think it best if we continue
like that never happened.

08:38.018 --> 08:38.894
It did.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.232
It meant a lot to me.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.898
I'd hoped you felt the same way.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.862
Is ii about Jimmy?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.026
Oh!

08:46.192 --> 08:47.193
No.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.662
It's not about Jimmy.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.073
I'm going to confirm
these applicants.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.456
Well, if it's not Jimmy,

08:52.615 --> 08:54.208
then tell me what's
bothering you, because...

08:54.367 --> 08:55.960
Chairman Hardcastle is waiting
for you in your office,

08:56.119 --> 08:57.712
Mr. Selfridge.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.226
Good to see you,
Mr. Hardcastle.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.606
Sorry to keep you waiting.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.950
This embargo on Whiteley's
is completely unjustified.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.610
Store's under
new management.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.779
You must've known
about the debts

09:30.945 --> 09:33.198
when you purchased
the store.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.662
A new slate,
Mr. Hardcastle.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.247
We'll make good
on the debts in time.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.333
Of course, we all have
nothing but goodwill

09:39.496 --> 09:40.873
towards your father.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.918
Is it me you're worried about?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.802
You know I'm not new
to the world of business,

09:45.960 --> 09:47.462
and I'm surrounded
by the greatest retailers

09:47.629 --> 09:48.505
in the country.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.890
HARDCASTLE:
No one doubts that.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.517
But the fact remains

09:52.675 --> 09:54.427
you are an unknown entity
in this business,

09:54.594 --> 09:55.891
Mr. Dillon.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.853
He's a man
of the future.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.360
He's my partner,
and I trust him.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.816
So can you.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.151
You're the largest supplier

10:06.314 --> 10:08.282
of linen and cotton
in the country.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.694
All the wholesalers
take their cue from you.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.615
If anyone can persuade them
to lift the embargo, you can.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.790
I'll consider my position

10:23.957 --> 10:26.051
and consult with fellow members
of the association.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.711
That's all we can ask for.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.675
It'll be a week
before I get back to you.

10:33.842 --> 10:34.684
Thank you.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.345
In the next
couple of days

10:36.511 --> 10:38.809
would be preferable,
Mr. Hardcastle.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.020
(laughs)

10:41.182 --> 10:43.480
You see how keen Jimmy is
to do business with you?

10:43.643 --> 10:44.690
A week will be fine.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.403
So, how is
Mrs. Hardcastle?

10:49.566 --> 10:50.613
Last time we spoke...

10:51.818 --> 10:53.161
You can't rush
these people, Jimmy.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.367
It's not how it's done.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.250
Lord Wynnstay.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.544
Anything solid

11:02.704 --> 11:04.547
on Harry Selfridge's
new business partner?

11:04.706 --> 11:07.129
I'm still digging.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.887
Dillon was with his mother
the night Colleano died.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.594
The police closed
their investigation.

11:13.756 --> 11:14.803
It's a dead end.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.013
I'm not convinced.

11:19.387 --> 11:24.234
Unless you've got something
rock solid, shut it down.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.195
So, the departments
are replenished

11:31.357 --> 11:33.451
with new stock each day
before doors opening.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.328
Currently, you're replenishing
every third day,

11:35.486 --> 11:36.703
according to the system?

11:36.863 --> 11:38.035
Correct.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.075
That'll see you through
until the embargo is lifted.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.914
I'd like to look at the stock
control in operation,

11:42.076 --> 11:43.168
if that's okay.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.375
I used to work
in the loading bay.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.754
Come and take a look.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.008
I'll leave you
gentlemen to it.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.088
Thank you.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.546
GEORGE:
Fresh stock rolls in every day,

11:52.712 --> 11:56.637
stacked according to size,
customer demand, life duration.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.301
JIMMY:
How do you mean?

11:58.468 --> 12:02.314
GEORGE: Soaps, candles--
small, but shift fast,

12:02.472 --> 12:04.691
so they're easily accessible
on the bottom rows.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.476
The anniversary stock.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.020
This was all pre-ordered
in bulk,

12:08.186 --> 12:10.063
so it'll go to the back
of the bay area.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.527
And why is that?

12:11.689 --> 12:12.941
Because it's not
needed yet.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.986
It's always like this
around sale time, Mr. Dillon.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.405
We've barely got enough space
for it all!

12:34.504 --> 12:35.426
(door opens)

12:40.385 --> 12:42.058
Roger's personal items.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.770
I thought I'd take them
to his family this evening.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.401
Are you all right, Mr. Crabb?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.606
I miss him.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.697
20 years of devotion
to this store

12:56.859 --> 13:02.161
and he won't be here for
the anniversary celebrations.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.870
<i>He'd be so cross.</i>

13:04.033 --> 13:06.001
(chuckles)

13:06.160 --> 13:08.379
We've lost some good people.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.790
It'll be a real challenge

13:09.956 --> 13:11.082
to replace that sort
of experience

13:11.249 --> 13:14.879
to carry us
through the next 20 years.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.526
I need to speak with you
urgently, Mr. Crabb.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.160
Please.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.676
I'll be blunt.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.837
We're running out of stock
at Whiteley's.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.052
There are systems in place
to monitor the stock.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.591
I talked you through them.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.680
There was a lot to take in.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.015
I must have missed
the finer details.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.475
All being well,

14:06.637 --> 14:08.765
credit will be resumed
with the wholesalers in a week.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.148
It'll be too late.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.060
We'll have to close the doors
within three days

14:12.226 --> 14:14.900
if I can't restock
those shelves.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.242
You have stock
that won't be used

14:19.400 --> 14:20.777
until the anniversary sale.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.911
I need to get that Selfridge
stock to Whiteley's.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.118
Out of the question.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.748
That's madness!

14:25.907 --> 14:27.284
Mr. Selfridge
has been working hard

14:27.450 --> 14:28.918
to break the embargo
at Whiteley's.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.329
This sort of action

14:30.495 --> 14:32.247
will seem to be an attempt
to get around the problem.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.962
Which is why Mr. Selfridge
must keep his hands clean.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.466
But we could do it.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.881
Just a few days, Mr. Crabb.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.173
Just enough stock,

14:42.340 --> 14:44.342
all to be replaced
before anyone's the wiser.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.260
It's stealing.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.348
Borrowing.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.934
Think of the alternative:

14:49.097 --> 14:50.599
Whiteley's closes.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.062
It could take months

14:52.225 --> 14:55.195
to open again, if ever.

14:55.353 --> 15:00.109
While I'm sympathetic to your
predicament, I can't help.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.496
Think, Mr. Crabb.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.959
Mr. Selfridge's failed venture
all over the papers,

15:13.121 --> 15:16.295
just as the Selfridge
20th anniversary parade

15:16.457 --> 15:18.050
troops down Oxford Street.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.140
What are you going to do?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.643
There's nothing else I can do.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.859
Go to Mr. Selfridge,
let him decide.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.364
Wait.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.533
You're right.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.118
If he agrees to your plan,

15:48.281 --> 15:49.999
it would be
incredibly damaging to him

15:50.158 --> 15:52.752
if his involvement
is discovered.

15:52.910 --> 15:56.665
That's why I came to you,
Mr. Crabb.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.093
This is an impossible decision.

16:04.255 --> 16:07.134
It's difficult.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.598
But not impossible.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.271
WOMAN:
Freddy!

16:20.438 --> 16:20.904
Lovely to see you.

16:21.063 --> 16:21.905
Nice to see you too.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.283
You look ravishing
<i>as</i> always, Rita.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.739
Oh Freddy,
you're such a flirt!

16:40.082 --> 16:43.177
No, Ernest,
do it again.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.589
So kind of you to bring
Roger's things, Arthur.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.508
I just wondered
how you all are.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.891
We're getting by.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.474
We're keeping busy.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.729
That's the spirit.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.059
Can I look at Father's things,
Mr. Crabb'?

16:58.226 --> 17:01.275
One more time
over the past pluperfect,

17:01.437 --> 17:03.735
please, Ernest.

17:03.898 --> 17:07.242
It's so difficult
when they mention Roger.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.778
(Sighs)

17:10.445 --> 17:12.574
Tell me about the store.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.959
Take my mind off things.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.242
Well, it's anniversary
this-and-that,

17:16.410 --> 17:17.332
as you can imagine.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.964
Hard work but fun, yes?

17:20.122 --> 17:21.874
Not all fun.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.589
I've had a difficult
decision to make.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.425
I hope I've done
the right thing.

17:27.588 --> 17:31.013
It's not like you to question
your decisions, Arthur.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.395
This one was particularly tough.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.941
Did Meryl tell you
Mrs. Towler's replacement

17:39.100 --> 17:40.477
didn't turn up?

17:40.643 --> 17:42.316
Yes, I heard--
the cheek of it!

17:42.478 --> 17:44.401
Running off to Liberty's
without telling people?

17:44.564 --> 17:48.114
It's hard to find people
of the right caliber these days.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.745
We need people like you.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.490
You aren't suggesting...

17:53.656 --> 17:55.954
Would it really be
so out of the question?

17:56.117 --> 17:58.586
Roger always said
you were a company woman.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.338
Yes, but the children need me.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.000
They've just lost
their father.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.918
Really, Arthur,
what an earth are you thinking?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.803
I'm sorry, Josie,
I never...

18:07.962 --> 18:09.339
Yes, well, I shall
make you some tea.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.758
I'm surprised you'd even
suggest such a thing.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.477
Is everything all right?

18:23.644 --> 18:26.739
I stupidly suggested her
coming back to work.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.444
I meant no offense.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.863
Actually, I think it'd do her
the world of good.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.422
Rosalie?

18:47.585 --> 18:49.679
I've waited.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.139
Yes?

18:52.298 --> 18:55.848
When are we going
to talk about Mae'?

18:56.010 --> 18:57.978
I know she stayed here
the other night.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.477
Rosalie...

19:00.640 --> 19:02.768
I need to know,
what are your intentions?

19:02.933 --> 19:03.809
(laughs)

19:03.976 --> 19:05.523
I don't believe this.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.279
I love her.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.361
Tatiana loves her.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.570
If you mess with her heart...

19:10.733 --> 19:13.953
Mae is the one keeping me
at a distance.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.288
She's probably trying
to protect herself.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.873
From me?

19:22.036 --> 19:24.380
She knows your history.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.540
She can see that I've changed.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.960
She's chosen the wrong men
in the past.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.799
She's been hurt.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.339
You need to give her time,

19:33.506 --> 19:37.010
prove to her that
you're the right man.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.103
There.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.894
Sharp as pins,
the pair of you.

19:48.479 --> 19:50.231
I took it from the box
Mr. Crabb brought.

19:51.732 --> 19:52.858
Can I have it?

19:54.985 --> 19:59.616
Yes, of course you can, Ernest.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.625
You shouldn't have to ask.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.003
He doesn't want
to upset you, Josie.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.413
None of us do.

20:05.579 --> 20:10.380
But we need to talk
about Father.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.671
We need to grieve.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.435
Oh my goodness, I'm sorry.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.441
This is precisely
what I didn't want to do.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.111
It's all right.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.482
I cry in my room
every night.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.945
Me too.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.035
ERNEST:
Sometimes I do.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.787
A bit.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.832
Well, you shouldn't have
to do that alone.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.292
(sniffling)

20:47.455 --> 20:50.709
I mean, we should all be,
I don't know, crying together!

20:50.875 --> 20:52.718
(laughter)

20:52.877 --> 20:57.098
I tell you what,
we'll do more as a family.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.678
Yes?

21:00.968 --> 21:01.890
Good.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.401
I have two tickets
to a lecture

21:16.567 --> 21:17.910
on Byzantine art
tomorrow evening.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.365
Do you want
to come with me'?

21:20.863 --> 21:23.116
I'm not in the habit
of accepting invitations

21:23.282 --> 21:24.875
someone else has refused.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.035
Miss Grove...

21:26.202 --> 21:27.829
Meryl, have I offended you
in some way?

21:27.995 --> 21:31.124
I thought we'd come
to an understanding.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.634
Then I saw you in the Tea Rooms
with another girl.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.467
Rita Rogers?

21:36.629 --> 21:38.506
No, she's an old friend.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.924
Who happens to be
a special friend

21:40.090 --> 21:41.216
of the great Carmo himself.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.971
Carmo's circus?

21:45.137 --> 21:47.356
That's a huge hit
at the Olympia.

21:47.515 --> 21:50.189
I'm booking their performers
for our anniversary parade.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.694
You were jealous, weren't you?

21:53.354 --> 21:55.106
Go on, admit it.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.117
The circus.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.328
Tomorrow evening.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.910
Oh, but it's completely
sold out.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.997
Well, if Miss Rogers
is such a good friend...

22:08.410 --> 22:10.128
You're asking the impossible.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.413
That's five tickets, Freddy.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.173
For all the family.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.130
I'll be ever so grateful.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.722
Five?

22:20.881 --> 22:22.508
What do you think,
Mr. Crabb?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.598
Obviously,
I'm not happy.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.478
But disaster
at Whiteley's

22:26.637 --> 22:28.890
means disaster
for Mr. Selfridge.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.980
Then this store suffers
the consequences too.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.144
I can't let that happen.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.736
Mr. Towler.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.239
Will you help me?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.158
Tonight, then.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.248
I'll arrange
the unmarked vans.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.539
Get me an inventory
of the stock that's needed

22:52.705 --> 22:55.049
and make sure the Whiteley's
loading bay is prepared.

22:55.207 --> 22:59.212
Thank you, both of you,
from the bottom of my heart.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.112
(elevator dings)

23:25.029 --> 23:25.905
Straight to Whiteley's.

23:26.071 --> 23:26.913
Yes, Mr. Towler.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.244
Come on.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.136
Any problems, come straight
back here, all right?

23:56.727 --> 23:58.445
Mr. Towler?

23:58.604 --> 24:01.198
Where is stock going
at this hour?

24:03.400 --> 24:06.745
I'm moving the anniversary stock
to our Shoreditch warehouse.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.827
It's taking up
too much room here.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.366
Shoreditch?

24:10.532 --> 24:12.284
That's where we kept
the provincial stores' stock,

24:12.451 --> 24:14.169
isn't it?

24:14.328 --> 24:17.673
But why isn't the loading bay
manager in charge?

24:17.831 --> 24:19.549
Moving stock comes
under my remit

24:19.708 --> 24:20.800
as head of Security.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.634
Why unmarked vans?

24:24.797 --> 24:28.722
The Selfridge vans
are out on deliveries.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.397
Waiting
for the mechanic.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.935
Thank you, Mr. Towler.

24:38.102 --> 24:41.447
I hope I haven't
inconvenienced you.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.697
Good night.

24:42.856 --> 24:43.948
Good night, Mr. Keen.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.948
(door closes)

24:51.115 --> 24:52.742
(snoring)

25:04.294 --> 25:05.216
Connie?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.433
You need to go to bed.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.727
Why are you so late?

25:12.886 --> 25:15.014
What've you been doing?

25:15.180 --> 25:17.774
Doesn't matter--
it's done now.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.311
Come on.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.444
(Sighs)

25:21.603 --> 25:22.980
Stiff as a board.

25:23.147 --> 25:25.445
You shouldn't have
waited up.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.780
I'll be fine
in the morning.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.570
You're staying in bed
tomorrow.

25:29.737 --> 25:30.738
Oh, George...

25:30.904 --> 25:31.996
I'm gonna make you
breakfast.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.783
They can do without me
for a few hours.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.293
I have to go
to work, George.

25:36.452 --> 25:37.328
I'll report you sick.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.370
(laughs)

25:38.537 --> 25:39.459
No arguing now.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.260
It is Selfridge--
we should ask.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.517
Quite so.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.927
Are you joining us
in the game tonight,

25:53.093 --> 25:54.060
Mr. Selfridge?

25:54.219 --> 25:55.687
No. Thank you, though.

25:55.846 --> 25:56.768
Right you are.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.700
I'm sorry,
it's late.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.611
I was at the club.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.246
Who could tell?

26:19.870 --> 26:20.917
I didn't want to go home

26:21.080 --> 26:24.960
without telling you that
I'll wait for you.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.048
I'll give you the time
and space you need.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.805
Which is what
you're doing right now?

26:29.963 --> 26:31.340
(laughs)

26:31.507 --> 26:32.679
Damn if I'm being

26:32.841 --> 26:34.559
my usual
impatient self.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.640
You don't say.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.857
Mae...

26:41.016 --> 26:43.485
You mean the world to me.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.271
Even if you did scare
the pants off me

26:45.437 --> 26:47.030
the first time I met you.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.612
(laughs)

26:49.775 --> 26:51.698
We have so much history.

26:51.860 --> 26:55.535
People we loved together,
people we hated together.

26:55.697 --> 26:59.668
But there's still us.

26:59.827 --> 27:03.001
Us.

27:03.163 --> 27:08.010
We've both come a long way.

27:08.168 --> 27:11.138
And through it all,
you've been my friend.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.094
And if I lose you,
I lose my friend,

27:13.257 --> 27:15.055
and I couldn't bear that.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.515
You'll never lose me.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.100
Trust me.

27:24.935 --> 27:26.187
Goodnight, Mae.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.405
(door closes)

27:45.873 --> 27:46.749
Meryl,

27:46.915 --> 27:48.258
about the circus...

27:48.417 --> 27:49.794
I've told the family, Freddy.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.678
You wouldn't believe
the excitement this morning.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.931
Um...

27:54.089 --> 27:57.969
I know it was a silly challenge,
but it really means so much.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.682
There's no performance
this evening.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.563
Or any other evening.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.520
It's finished.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.604
I'm so sorry.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.315
I'll have to telephone ahead.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.948
Tell them not to come.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.661
Wait!

28:21.033 --> 28:22.250
I have an idea.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.956
But I will need your help.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.984
Can I be of any
assistance, Mr. Keen?

28:47.142 --> 28:48.359
Thank you Mr. Crabb,

28:48.518 --> 28:50.020
but I've found
what I was looking for.

29:00.113 --> 29:03.913
Could you clarify
something, Mr. Crabb?

29:04.076 --> 29:08.081
We did cancel our contract
with the Shoreditch warehouse,

29:08.247 --> 29:09.214
didn't we?

29:10.916 --> 29:12.042
Indeed we did.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.883
Soon as we moved
the provincial store stock.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.934
(door closes)

29:21.093 --> 29:22.686
CRABB:
How did it all go?

29:22.844 --> 29:24.687
Nothing to worry about,
Mr. Crabb.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.189
Thank goodness.

29:26.348 --> 29:27.941
You're sure nobody
saw anything?

29:28.100 --> 29:29.818
Mr. Keen asked
a few questions,

29:29.977 --> 29:31.604
but I fobbed him off.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.942
Mr. Keen?

29:33.105 --> 29:35.028
He saw the vans coming out.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.942
I told him we were
shifting stock

29:37.109 --> 29:39.407
to the Shoreditch
warehouse.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.038
Mr. Crabb?

29:42.197 --> 29:43.574
Are you all right?

29:43.740 --> 29:45.037
You've gone as white
as a sheet.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.669
We have to go
to Mr. Selfridge immediately.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.343
Gentlemen,
Mr. Selfridge is engaged.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.973
Oh yes, thank you.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.354
What have you done?

30:13.395 --> 30:15.773
I didn't see
any other way.

30:15.939 --> 30:17.816
Mr. Crabb and Mr. Towler

30:17.983 --> 30:19.405
were just trying
to protect your interests.

30:19.568 --> 30:23.618
Stealing is in my interests?

30:23.780 --> 30:26.158
Mr. Towler and Mr. Crabb,
we'll speak later.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.506
KEEN:
Staff out of control.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.588
Stock shifted to a business

30:35.751 --> 30:37.298
that has nothing to do
with Selfridge's.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.805
I will handle the situation,
Mr. Keen.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.806
Of course, the stock
will have to stay there now.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.558
We can't risk this
getting out.

30:43.717 --> 30:47.472
Gordon, order more
replacement stock.

30:47.637 --> 30:48.980
Do what you have to do.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.312
But the fact remains,
you have misplaced

30:51.475 --> 30:53.318
your trust
in this man.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.904
And I misplaced
my trust in you.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.159
I have no option
but to report this to the Civic.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.117
Harry, I can fix this.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.536
Go home, Jimmy.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.954
I'll go to the Civic.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.042
Go home.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.295
Now.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.851
You'd better have a good reason
for pursuing this.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.765
I have a story,
I know I have.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.026
Dillon storms out
of Colleano's club.

31:34.184 --> 31:35.527
So what?

31:35.685 --> 31:38.108
He was furious Madame Rennard
spent all evening with Colleano

31:38.271 --> 31:40.615
when she arrived
on Dillon's arm.

31:40.774 --> 31:43.277
Club staff told me
Colleano was planning

31:43.443 --> 31:46.071
an intimate dinner for two
the night he died.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.990
Madame Rennard?

31:48.156 --> 31:51.251
You're not suggesting Mae
had anything to do with it?

31:51.410 --> 31:52.832
No.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.587
But she told you
where Dillon was.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.169
I wondered if the police
had checked, and they hadn't.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.925
He wasn't with his mother.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.301
She spent all evening
at a church gathering.

32:00.460 --> 32:03.088
You can prove that?

32:03.255 --> 32:05.474
I spoke with the vicar himself.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.957
I just want us to be clear,

32:31.116 --> 32:33.539
none of this was
my father's doing.

32:33.702 --> 32:36.706
But it was his business
partner's doing.

32:37.873 --> 32:38.965
You know, I'm not the enemy.

32:41.168 --> 32:42.920
I've been trying to protect
you and your father

32:43.086 --> 32:44.258
more than you think.

32:48.341 --> 32:49.558
Good evening to you,
Mr. Gordon.

33:00.020 --> 33:00.942
Ah!

33:11.114 --> 33:12.741
(shouts in pain)

33:22.626 --> 33:23.548
Ah!

33:25.629 --> 33:27.802
(heavy breathing)

33:27.964 --> 33:29.682
I just wanted you to know

33:29.841 --> 33:32.845
we don't hold either
of you responsible.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.605
My father and I have to take
our share of the blame.

33:35.764 --> 33:40.315
We should've kept a closer check
on Mr. Dillon's management.

33:40.477 --> 33:41.899
GEORGE:
Thank you, Mr. Gordon.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.279
Mr. Towler!

33:43.438 --> 33:44.781
You have to get home
straightaway.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.032
The doctor's been called.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.989
Your wife's gone into labor.

33:48.151 --> 33:49.494
I should've stayed with her.

33:51.821 --> 33:52.162
Go.

33:52.322 --> 33:53.995
Go!

34:00.872 --> 34:02.419
I'm so sorry.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.708
There isn't gonna be

34:03.875 --> 34:05.092
a performance tonight.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.799
<i>The circus has finished.</i>

34:06.962 --> 34:08.384
I've made a complete mess
of things.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.014
Oh, well,

34:10.172 --> 34:12.801
that's all right, Meryl.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.936
We can all go
to the Tea Rooms

34:15.094 --> 34:17.438
when you've finished work
instead, yes?

34:17.597 --> 34:19.850
Not the same
as a circus, though.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.233
No.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.360
Nothing like.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.396
I'm sorry, Ernest.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.027
Who wants to go
to the toy department?

34:28.190 --> 34:28.908
Oh yes, good idea.

34:29.067 --> 34:29.784
My treat, yes?

34:29.943 --> 34:31.159
Come along, then.

34:39.119 --> 34:40.085
Oh!

34:40.245 --> 34:42.293
Madame Rennard's
autumn collection.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.549
It's Italian silk.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.132
You can tell the quality
straightaway.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.547
And look at those darts.

34:49.713 --> 34:50.679
(gasps)

34:50.839 --> 34:52.556
That's good sign
of good tailoring.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.184
You love being here.

34:57.345 --> 35:00.645
Mr. Crabb told me that
he asked you to come back.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.151
Now I'm asking.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.945
Yes, but
what about the children?

35:10.108 --> 35:13.658
Surely they would think
I was abandoning them.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.697
Why don't you ask them?

35:18.241 --> 35:20.994
I'm genuinely sorry, Harry.

35:21.161 --> 35:22.754
I thought I'd pay you
the courtesy

35:22.912 --> 35:24.505
of showing you first.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.758
This is sheer nonsense.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.260
I wouldn't print it
if it wasn't solid.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.295
No.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.214
No, it's low,

35:32.380 --> 35:34.929
even by your rag's
standards.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.014
I didn't have to come here.

35:37.177 --> 35:40.602
I certainly didn't come here
to be insulted.

35:40.764 --> 35:44.064
Even if this isn't to get at me,
you have Jimmy Dillon all wrong.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.442
He's not a murderer.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.320
There's enough to provoke
a proper police inquiry,

35:47.479 --> 35:48.651
at the very least.

35:48.813 --> 35:52.238
We run with the story
first thing in the morning.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.822
Good day.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.075
Where is she?

36:00.241 --> 36:02.289
It's a boy, George.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.089
A beautiful, healthy
baby boy.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.525
Mr. Selfridge
to see you, sir.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.568
Harry.

36:34.734 --> 36:35.826
I'm sorry.

36:35.985 --> 36:37.202
I'm not here
about the stock, Jimmy.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.575
The Herald is running
with a story about you tomorrow.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.994
What kind of story?

36:44.160 --> 36:45.412
Total nonsense.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.296
Accusing you of killing
Victor Colleano.

36:47.455 --> 36:50.629
Now, the good news is
we've been forewarned.

36:50.792 --> 36:51.668
Harry...

36:51.835 --> 36:52.711
We can get ahead of this

36:52.877 --> 36:54.003
with a press release
of our own.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.672
We can make it clear

36:55.839 --> 36:57.182
that this is all part
of Wynnstay's

36:57.340 --> 36:58.466
ongoing vendetta
against me.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.509
Harry...

36:59.676 --> 37:00.802
Against people
that I work with.

37:00.969 --> 37:02.186
No press release.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.848
We have to fight back hard,
Jimmy.

37:05.014 --> 37:05.685
If we don't...

37:05.849 --> 37:08.068
I did kill Victor.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.277
No.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.572
No.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.617
Why?

37:26.244 --> 37:28.087
It was an accident.

37:29.998 --> 37:32.421
We argued about Mae.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.801
Mae?

37:38.631 --> 37:39.974
I was jealous.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.600
We fought.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.230
I never meant for him
to fall.

37:49.392 --> 37:53.818
Every night, I see it happening
over and over again.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.950
Why didn't you come to me?

37:59.486 --> 38:02.239
I didn't want to see the look
that's in your eyes right now.

38:02.405 --> 38:05.454
I put my trust in you.

38:06.993 --> 38:09.246
I thought us buying
Whiteley's together,

38:09.412 --> 38:11.414
somehow you could shield me
from what I've done.

38:11.581 --> 38:14.585
But even Harry Selfridge
can't do that.

38:14.751 --> 38:18.176
I came to look at you
as a son.

38:18.338 --> 38:21.217
I am so sorry.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.477
Harry, I am so sorry
for everything.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.899
I'm not a bad man, Harry.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.811
I never meant
for Victor to fall.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.196
Everything about you is a lie.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.910
Everything.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.537
You killed a man.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.538
And then you think that
you can just hide behind me?

38:47.700 --> 38:49.202
I'll go to the police.

38:49.369 --> 38:50.291
Pay your price.

38:50.453 --> 38:51.329
Harry...

38:51.496 --> 38:52.622
Pay your price.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.427
I want nothing more
to do with you.

39:04.634 --> 39:05.556
(door slams)

39:10.181 --> 39:12.354
(swing)

39:12.517 --> 39:15.191
MISS MARDLE: Now, I know I've
been trying to organize you all

39:15.353 --> 39:17.105
rather too much.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.617
Please bear with me while I try
and muddle through, won't you?

39:20.775 --> 39:22.152
ERNEST:
You're doing a great job,

39:22.318 --> 39:25.288
and I'll fight anyone
who says otherwise.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.620
Would any of you be upset
if Josie went back to work?

39:28.783 --> 39:31.036
We could all help out.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.170
Is that what
you want, Josie?

39:33.329 --> 39:35.252
No, not if it makes you
unhappy, I don't, no.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.883
Will you still
read me stories

39:37.041 --> 39:38.133
and tuck me in
every night?

39:38.293 --> 39:40.216
Yes, of course
I will, Ernest.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.631
Father working
didn't make us unhappy.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.674
It wouldn't be
any different with you.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.309
As long as
we're together.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.265
I mean, that's
the main thing.

39:48.428 --> 39:50.305
We'll always be
together, Eleanor.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.394
We're family now.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.199
Good evening, and welcome!

40:04.903 --> 40:05.745
This way, please.

40:05.904 --> 40:06.826
Go on, Ernest.

40:08.239 --> 40:12.289
♪♪

40:19.584 --> 40:20.927
(gasps)

40:22.795 --> 40:23.842
Oh!

40:34.140 --> 40:35.767
Look at the acrobats!

40:37.435 --> 40:39.358
Did you do all this?

40:39.520 --> 40:40.988
It was Freddy's idea.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.117
(laughs)

41:02.710 --> 41:06.590
(applause)

41:16.057 --> 41:17.525
Harry, what's the matter?

41:23.147 --> 41:24.945
Jimmy killed Victor.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.909
Oh my God, so it's true.

41:30.071 --> 41:32.620
You knew?

41:48.423 --> 41:51.393
MAE: I was meant to be having
dinner with Victor that night.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.770
Just dinner with a dear friend.

41:57.932 --> 42:05.066
Jimmy had become
far too possessive, jealous.

42:05.231 --> 42:07.450
He was trying to own me.

42:07.608 --> 42:09.861
Well, what made you
suspect him?

42:10.028 --> 42:17.162
A journalist started asking
questions about Victor's death,

42:17.326 --> 42:21.923
and Jimmy acted... strangely.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.924
So I went to him.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.926
I confronted him.

42:26.085 --> 42:29.009
And you didn't think
to tell me any of this?

42:29.172 --> 42:32.176
Well no, because he...

42:34.218 --> 42:37.597
He denied it, and I had
no reason to disbelieve him.

42:37.764 --> 42:40.688
How could you not
say anything to me?

42:40.850 --> 42:42.727
Because I had no proof,

42:42.894 --> 42:46.239
and you'd just gone
into business with him.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.525
You believed in Jimmy so much.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.534
This may well destroy me
and my family.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.286
Harry...

42:52.445 --> 42:54.539
No, I have to say
goodnight, Mae.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.074
I have to take all this in.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.334
I thought I knew you,
I thought I knew Jimmy.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.791
I don't know who to trust.
