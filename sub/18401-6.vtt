No. I'm Daddy.

a little undressed.

Get off me.
Get off me.

In the short time
that we've known each other,

00:33.642 --> 00:35.078
I've gotten a sense
of your morals and values,

00:35.122 --> 00:36.993
and I believe that they're
really on point,

00:37.037 --> 00:38.908
and I want to support them,
and I want to support you.

00:38.951 --> 00:41.867
You really would do
anything for me, huh?

00:41.911 --> 00:44.087
Detective, we know
your partner is dirty,

00:44.131 --> 00:45.915
and we need you to find out

00:45.958 --> 00:46.916
who the leader is.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.265
Leon told me everything.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.788
I know the softball
team is dirty.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.007
The team is dirty?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.095
Oh, don't play
dumb, Tolbeck.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.314

a laundry bag.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.315

00:54.358 --> 00:56.404
I never even looked in that bag.

00:58.362 --> 00:59.581
Okay, I'm gonna
open the bag.

00:59.624 --> 01:00.582
Are you ready?
Okay, yeah.

01:00.625 --> 01:01.713
On the count of three.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.107
One... three.
Two, three.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.717
Wait. Ugh.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.503
I can't believe this.

01:08.546 --> 01:09.852
I'm the dirty cop.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.636
I've been dirty all this time.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.901
Are you telling me that you had
no idea about this?

01:15.945 --> 01:18.034
I swear on my life.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.818
Cullen, are you mad?
Don't be mad.
I'm not mad.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.211
I'm not mad. I'm not mad.
I'm not mad.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.083

Let's just go.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.826
in Mexico in 20 minutes.
The border's right there.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.002
You're right. I was thinking
of the Texas border.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.830
Tolbeck, you're not
thinking straight, okay?

01:31.874 --> 01:34.050
Yes, I am. Look. We could do
a Shawshank Redemption.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.226
A what?It's a movie. I don't know
if you've ever seen it.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.228
I've seen it. I've seen it.But it's these
two murderers, they're...

01:38.272 --> 01:40.056
They form a heartwarming bond
while they're in prison.Yeah, I've seen it.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.972
I've seen it. I've seen it.And then they
escape from prison.

01:43.015 --> 01:45.931
At the end of the movie,
they're sanding a boat.I have seen it. I've seen it.

01:45.975 --> 01:47.150
They're free.
That could be us.

01:47.194 --> 01:50.153
Get busy living
or get busy sanding.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.633
Shut up about
Shawshank Redemption.

01:51.676 --> 01:54.157
I've got a plan.
Get in the car.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.289
Bring the money.

01:55.332 --> 01:57.029
Oh.

01:57.073 --> 01:59.162
You mean the laundry? Yeah.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.772
You're gonna love Shawshank Redemption.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.992
It's something we can watch
on the way to Mexico

02:03.035 --> 02:04.341
if we decide to do it.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.951
It's such a great movie.

02:05.995 --> 02:09.651
AFI said it's one of the top
hundred movies of all time.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.783
I've seen
Shawshank Redemption!

protect Frankie.

someone; can't stop it.

I mean, here's the thing about
this job, right, Steve?

05:54.049 --> 05:56.573
It's creating, in my head,

05:56.617 --> 06:01.273
two separate
divergent lives, okay?

06:01.317 --> 06:03.493
Dustin, the man that I am,

06:03.537 --> 06:06.017
the man that
my family raised,

06:06.061 --> 06:08.977
Dustin, the last time
I had sex, honest to God,

06:09.020 --> 06:11.893
was my ex-wife.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.895
After she left,

06:13.938 --> 06:16.114
I-I haven't had a meaningful
sexual relationship since then.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.203
And that was ten years ago.

06:18.247 --> 06:21.032
Marco, though, I mean...

06:21.076 --> 06:22.991
Marco's sex life
is prolific.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.688
How weird is that?

06:24.732 --> 06:28.257
The most sex that I've
ever had is in character.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.737
Now, that's got
to be weird.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.478
I should talk to somebody
about that, right?

06:31.521 --> 06:35.482
I think Marco might be
a love and/or sex addict.

06:35.525 --> 06:38.267
I should probably go
to meetings in character.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.573
How weird is that?

06:39.616 --> 06:41.923
I'm gonna have to go to
addiction meetings

06:41.966 --> 06:44.621

I did yesterday?

06:48.059 --> 06:51.715
I bought a backpack for
school with flowers on it.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.371

wear it for her.
