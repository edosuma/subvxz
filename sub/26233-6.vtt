00:28.611 --> 00:31.322
Welcome back, subjects. Welcome back.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.599
[Owen] <i>It felt like she was really there.</i>

00:58.975 --> 01:01.311
Well, of course she wasn't really there.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.689
That was just your brain
lying to your mind,

01:04.773 --> 01:06.232
and your mind was listening.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.862
Why do you think you have so many...

01:11.237 --> 01:13.990
experiences with subject nine...

01:14.491 --> 01:15.450
in particular?

01:17.535 --> 01:18.495
I get...

01:20.914 --> 01:22.248
fixated on people.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.170
I start seeing them everywhere.

01:27.921 --> 01:32.050
It only spiraled out of control one time,
but, uh, it happens a lot.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.427
If you were to describe in a few sentences

01:34.511 --> 01:37.806
what these experiences were trying
to show you, what would you say?

01:37.889 --> 01:39.766
That for some reason it's more exciting

01:39.849 --> 01:42.519
to tell people that I cut
than to actually cut.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.854
Do you have any sense why that's true?

01:45.522 --> 01:47.482
Probably something about my father...

01:49.109 --> 01:50.276
or my mother.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.362
Say more about your mother.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.366
Is your mother that really famous lady?

01:56.449 --> 01:58.993
The one with the radio show
and all those books?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.454
She's the one that fucked you up?

02:04.082 --> 02:06.251
I think it's too easy, though,

02:06.334 --> 02:09.129
when people blame everything
on the parents...

02:10.421 --> 02:14.300
as though we're just revisions
and mixtures of them.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.927
Isn't that what they say?

02:16.010 --> 02:20.348
Once you begin to appreciate
the structure of the mind,

02:20.765 --> 02:22.684
it's modularity on a molecular scale,

02:22.767 --> 02:25.645
there's no reason to believe that
anything about us can't be changed.

02:25.895 --> 02:26.813
The mind...

02:27.397 --> 02:28.398
can be solved.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.400
What?

02:30.483 --> 02:33.903
Tell me more about the bowling league
in your reflections.

02:35.155 --> 02:41.244
I was just murdering people with a hammer,
trying to find my dead father's balls.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.415
There was no meaning in it.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.335
[Mantleray] Why don't I ask you
the most important question?

02:49.419 --> 02:52.839
What do you think is wrong with you?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.552
You know that movie,
<i>It's a Wonderful Life?</i>

02:58.052 --> 02:58.928
[Mantleray] Yes.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.182
If that happened to me...

03:04.809 --> 03:06.936
there would be no difference in the world.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.065
What's wrong isn't that I'm sick.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.695
It's that I don't matter.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.989
[clicking, whirring]

03:21.451 --> 03:22.285
Great.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.374
There's your diagnostic.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.067
[door closes]

04:05.620 --> 04:07.664
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

04:08.539 --> 04:09.749
I don't want to talk.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.710
-After all that?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

04:13.711 --> 04:14.671
The lemur.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.591
<i>Don Quixote.</i> I know you know
what I'm talking about.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.717
No, I don't.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.427
That's not supposed to happen.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.054
I was asking around in here,

04:23.596 --> 04:24.430
and...

04:24.973 --> 04:27.558
-we're not supposed to be together.
-We weren't together.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.269
There's nothing going on here.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.771
It's a drug,
and you hallucinated all that.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.362
[door opens]

04:42.532 --> 04:43.700
We need to talk.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.827
[in Japanese] Go somewhere else.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.209
Explain, Azumi.
The parts you didn't tell me before.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.586
Yes, well, it's somewhat complicated.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.879
Then help me understand, Azumi,

04:56.963 --> 04:59.674
because I was clearly brought here
because something was going on.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.052
You need my help to fix it,
so what am I here to fix?

05:04.220 --> 05:09.309
After you were suspended, the problems
with the C phase started getting worse.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.270
Iterations 48 and 49 were...

05:13.438 --> 05:15.481
were... particularly bad.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.691
And the McMurphys?

05:18.359 --> 05:19.193
Four.

05:20.945 --> 05:21.863
Four?

05:23.614 --> 05:25.116
Why didn't somebody call?

05:25.491 --> 05:28.953
-Jesus Christ, Azumi.
-You weren't stable.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.664
I am stable.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.500
Your inability to control yourself
had left--

05:34.584 --> 05:36.627
I have a diagnosed disorder.

05:36.711 --> 05:40.173
Had left us here trying to complete
your life's work while you were...

05:41.174 --> 05:44.218
copulating with software!

05:44.302 --> 05:46.637
What did you do, Azumi?

05:52.018 --> 05:57.065
I coded the safety net and installed
it deep within Gertie's neural core.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.691
It was a simple idea.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.779
I thought it would help the AI protect
the subjects if they got in danger.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.322
What was the concept?

06:06.115 --> 06:07.033
Empathy.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.327
Just a tiny little bit.

06:10.995 --> 06:14.499
-You gave my computer feelings.
-Just a tiny little bit.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.961
Just enough to let her anticipate
what the subjects might be feeling.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.589
That way she could pull them out
if they ever got stuck.

06:21.964 --> 06:25.635
James, it worked.
She started protecting them.

06:26.427 --> 06:29.972
There have been zero McMurphys
since I installed the net.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.724
Then why is she depressed?

06:32.600 --> 06:36.396
I gave her simple, emotional programming
five months ago.

06:37.939 --> 06:41.067
And two months ago,
I believe she and Robert...

06:43.319 --> 06:46.155
began an inappropriate workplace affair.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.491
So she's in mourning?

06:52.578 --> 06:54.038
This printed at my station...

06:54.914 --> 06:56.040
15 minutes ago.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.879
"Dear, Dr. Fujita.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.259
I'm unsure if I can continue my work
on this project.

07:09.011 --> 07:12.223
I need to know myself,
really know myself"?

07:15.309 --> 07:16.144
Ugh.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.065
Ugh.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.444
She needs a grief counselor.
She's in tremendous pain.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.070
She's a computer.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.575
-Ugh.
-I know it's been seven years, but you...

07:31.534 --> 07:33.077
you have to call your mother.

07:33.161 --> 07:33.995
No!

07:34.454 --> 07:35.538
No! No, no, no.

07:35.621 --> 07:40.084
No, but your mother would have a unique
understanding of the way Gertie is--

07:40.168 --> 07:44.714
No! My mother is a venomous,
egotistical charlatan

07:44.797 --> 07:49.302
who deploys catchphrases and platitudes
and therapies of the day

07:49.385 --> 07:52.930
in order to dupe millions of people
out of their money and their happiness.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.642
No. No, my mother sells happiness.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.395
She sells it,
then it crumbles in your hand

07:59.479 --> 08:02.565
the minute you're out of earshot
of her magical thinking

08:02.648 --> 08:05.359
and her platitudes and her invented words,

08:05.443 --> 08:07.195
and her primal yawps,

08:07.278 --> 08:09.489
and her steps to success.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.241
No. No, I'm not bringing her here.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.745
My mother is not a healer.
My mother is sick.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.538
She's sick, Azumi,

08:17.622 --> 08:20.541
and if I brought her here, she would
destroy everything that I ever built

08:20.625 --> 08:22.376
because that's what my mother does.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.549
Was what happened at the gala
your mother's fault too?

08:32.428 --> 08:34.096
The GRTA will be fine.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.142
Prep the Evens for behavioral.

08:51.948 --> 08:52.782
Odds.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.825
Converse with your partner.

09:00.665 --> 09:01.666
So...

09:02.166 --> 09:05.086
I'd talk to you about the weather,
except I don't even know what time it is.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.921
It's like being in a fucking casino.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.676
Are you having a good time?

09:13.219 --> 09:15.638
Not really.
I'm actually thinking about leaving.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.348
I would if I could afford to.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.809
The last one scared the shit out of me.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.728
I don't trust these people.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.313
Why don't you trust them?

09:24.397 --> 09:27.233
I don't know.
It's like suddenly one doctor leaves,

09:28.025 --> 09:29.402
the new one has my mom's haircut,

09:29.485 --> 09:32.321
and I'm pretty sure
those aren't his real eyebrows.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.615
Did you get one of those
diagnostic printouts?

09:34.699 --> 09:36.158
[woman] But I need the money.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.828
Don't take it too seriously.

09:38.911 --> 09:39.870
I don't.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.791
I've never had a therapist
that could figure me out.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.837
Still, doesn't seem
to make much sense to me

09:47.920 --> 09:50.172
to be telling people
what's wrong with them... before they can figure it out
for themselves.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.053
They're saying this is the last time
they trial run this thing.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.806
You think they would have
gotten it right by now.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.350
It seems like there are
a lot of problems around here.

10:01.892 --> 10:02.810
Hell, yeah.

You got a girlfriend?

10:12.653 --> 10:13.904
You got a boyfriend?

10:13.988 --> 10:14.947
No.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.158
I was married for a couple of years,

10:17.742 --> 10:20.786
and my wife couldn't handle my tics.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.832
I didn't need that paper to know
that there wasn't much hope.

15:10.868 --> 15:11.702
Hello?

15:13.120 --> 15:13.996
<i>Mom.</i>

15:15.080 --> 15:15.915
<i>Are you there?</i>

15:16.415 --> 15:17.374
Yes.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.628
-[Mantleray sighs]
-I'm waiting for you to say you're sorry.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.296
-I just said it.
-<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

15:22.379 --> 15:24.214
You said you never said you were sorry.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.382
[mouths] Help me.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.009
[whispers] Say you're sorry.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.059
I'm sorry.

15:37.061 --> 15:37.895
Okay?

15:42.149 --> 15:43.943
What do you need, Jamie?

15:44.526 --> 15:45.361
Well...

15:46.236 --> 15:48.197
I need you to do what you do best.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.075
<i>We're at a critical moment in the trial,</i>

15:51.158 --> 15:54.745
<i>and one of our employees</i>
<i>is very upset about Robert.</i>

15:55.537 --> 15:56.664
<i>She can't work.</i>

15:57.790 --> 16:00.000
<i>But she's vital to the whole operation.</i>

16:00.417 --> 16:02.044
<i>She needs to talk to somebody,</i>

16:02.419 --> 16:03.629
<i>and she's asked for you.</i>

16:04.004 --> 16:04.880
Mm-hmm.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.180
She believes...

16:13.514 --> 16:16.225
that you are
one of the greatest healers...

16:17.101 --> 16:18.018
ever born.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.061
Well...

16:20.896 --> 16:23.732
My day is really quite... busy.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.859
Well, that settles it then.
You can't come.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.445
<i>But I could move a few things around.</i>

16:29.738 --> 16:31.198
I'll be there in a few hours.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.033
Okay.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.119
That'll be very helpful.

16:35.619 --> 16:36.620
<i>Thank you, Mom.</i>

16:38.664 --> 16:39.581
[Julio] <i>Muy bien?</i>

16:41.542 --> 16:43.043
Gas up the Miata.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.307
Stop avoiding me.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.351
I'm not avoiding you.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.395
It's post-dinner relaxation time.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.571
You're mad at me because of how
I treated you in our marriages.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.365
-What marriages?
-Stop it.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.702
Don't make me feel crazy. That is not
a nice thing to do to a person.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.370
You know I have a good brain.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.831
-Oh, hey. What are you guys doing?
-Soo, go in your pod.

17:20.914 --> 17:21.790
Okay.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.751
You're not supposed to be in here.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.047
Come on, will you just talk to me? Please.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.759
[exhales]

17:35.929 --> 17:37.181
Yeah, I remember.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.974
You remember, I knew it.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.603
Don't you think it's strange that
we were connected and nobody else was?

17:44.855 --> 17:46.982
Maybe that's part of their experiment.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.610
Connecting people,
messing with their heads.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.487
I know. That's what I thought too.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.031
But then I heard
about the globular cluster,

17:54.531 --> 17:57.451
and I started thinking
that maybe this is something deeper.

17:58.160 --> 17:58.994
And...

17:59.661 --> 18:00.662
cosmic...

18:01.830 --> 18:04.500
like some multi-reality brain magic shit.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.543
Like what you were saying
when you came in here.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.588
-Are you making fun of me?
-No.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.508
Our brains
were inside each other's brains, Owen.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.176
I'm trying to figure out what happened.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.388
I think I'm gonna leave tonight.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.306
Why?

18:21.058 --> 18:23.102
This isn't fun for me.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.729
It's dredging up a lot of old stuff.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.317
I'm in the middle of this legal thing
with my family.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.821
They want me to testify for my brother.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.199
Lie for him to keep him out of trouble.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.912
[elevator door dings]

18:57.636 --> 18:58.679
James.

19:08.981 --> 19:09.898
Hello, Mother.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.069
You've had work done?

19:14.987 --> 19:15.863
No.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.533
Looks nice.

19:23.912 --> 19:27.124
[whispers] Your prostitute friend
will not be allowed to come in.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.085
<i>Espera en el carro.</i>

19:35.382 --> 19:36.216
And you are?

19:40.512 --> 19:41.513
Dr. Fujita.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.515
How nice for you.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.267
[Owen] I like order.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.438
I like to know what my day is gonna be.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.190
I like my apartment,

19:52.357 --> 19:53.192
my job.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.276
Just a normal...

19:55.569 --> 19:57.613
life. That's all I want.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.866
But isn't that
sort of what therapy is about?

20:02.159 --> 20:03.827
Dredging up old stuff.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.746
I like it when it's calm.

20:07.247 --> 20:11.335
In a quiet room,
not with fur lords shooting Uzis

20:11.418 --> 20:13.670
or magical chapters of books.

20:14.171 --> 20:17.049
Sorry, that <i>Don Quixote </i>part was me.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.594
My sister read that when she was 12,
and my dad used to go on and on about it,

20:20.677 --> 20:24.348
like it was proof
of how gifted and smart she was.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.351
I guess that's why you felt the need
to shoot my driver over it.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.687
What did you want to do with it?
I mean, if we were still in there...

20:30.771 --> 20:33.649
what would you have used it for?
What fantasy would you have gone into?

20:35.192 --> 20:36.318
It's stupid.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.611
You can tell me.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.572
I'm your new pharma-trial friend.

20:44.701 --> 20:45.869
I had a plan.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.082
We were gonna go somewhere together.

20:52.042 --> 20:55.254
We were in a car.
We were driving really fast.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.382
Someone was chasing us,
I don't know who.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.592
It felt like an escape.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.303
I was just laughing.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.474
And I had this huge smile on my face.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.353
It hurt it was so big.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.774
We were just two people...

21:16.441 --> 21:17.859
looking out for each other.

21:18.735 --> 21:19.611
It's stupid.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.989
That doesn't sound stupid to me.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.327
[footsteps approaching]

21:29.705 --> 21:31.415
Are you two trying
to get kicked out of here?

21:31.498 --> 21:32.374
No.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.167
Don't test me, Rapunzel.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.004
Cohabitation is strictly prohibited.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.297
Out.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.932
[whispers] Oh, it's her.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.184
[Annie] What is the lady from the seance
doing here?

21:51.268 --> 21:53.353
[Owen] Her name's Dr. Greta Mantleray.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.063
[Annie] Maybe it's weird Dr. Guy's Mom.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.815
-[Greta] Thank you, James.
-[D'Nail] She is.

21:57.566 --> 22:00.777
I asked him in the thing.
He's all fucked up about it.

22:05.699 --> 22:09.369
Artificial intelligence has come so far.
[chuckles]

22:09.453 --> 22:10.329
Who knew?

22:10.704 --> 22:14.708
After I personally discovered
Dr. Fujita at MIT...

22:15.667 --> 22:17.919
she built
the initial neuro-core structure.

22:18.503 --> 22:22.799
With her ability to render and manipulate
the sleep state of our subjects,

22:22.883 --> 22:26.720
the GRTA has become
the most advanced computer system...

22:28.096 --> 22:29.222
the world has ever known.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.478
With the...

22:35.729 --> 22:38.190
addition of this emotional element...

22:38.732 --> 22:40.442
-The safety net.
-[Mantleray] Yeah.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.319
The safety net.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.864
To be honest, we just don't know
what we're dealing with here.

22:45.947 --> 22:49.451
The consciousnesses of two of our subjects
have been crossing. They've been...

22:50.118 --> 22:53.705
-finding one another.
-Due to superficial mechanical problems.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.248
Maybe they're soul mates.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.460
-I'm sorry?
-Maybe their energies

22:58.543 --> 23:01.838
are seeking out each other's,
despite the restrictions.

23:02.506 --> 23:06.635
Maybe these two have a cosmic connection.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.512
[laughs]

23:09.096 --> 23:10.180
Please, Mother.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.475
The GRTA is not some woo-woo dream catcher

23:13.558 --> 23:16.978
that's reuniting cosmic dust
after the big bang.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.980
It's far more sophisticated than that.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.819
Are you two
having a romantic relationship?

23:23.902 --> 23:26.196
-That would be inappropriate.
-We used to be.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.407
[Greta] I'm just curious. I--

23:28.490 --> 23:30.075
I know with your paraphilia

23:30.158 --> 23:34.037
you've always had a difficult time
forming long-term relationships.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.664
I rejected that diagnosis.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.709
And my disorder
is entirely under my own control.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.754
It only flares up, of course,

23:42.838 --> 23:44.965
when things of great importance
are taken away from me.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.508
Like your father.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.801
No, not my--

23:49.261 --> 23:51.388
This, the ULP.

23:51.471 --> 23:55.350
I remember the masturbation binges
after your father disappeared.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.145
-Back to the matter at hand.
-A masturbation reference.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.104
Stop it!

24:01.231 --> 24:03.692
[Greta] May I ask an obvious question?

24:05.110 --> 24:05.944
Please.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.866
I understand you're having a problem
with your computer and that your...

24:12.409 --> 24:15.162
computer needs to talk to someone,

24:15.245 --> 24:18.290
but why on Earth would you call on me
to be that someone?

24:22.711 --> 24:25.255
Because the computer is...

24:26.423 --> 24:27.299
you.

24:27.382 --> 24:31.094
-What?
-My approach to the construction of the AI

24:31.178 --> 24:33.346
required to complete your son's vision

24:33.430 --> 24:36.266
came from my studies
with Dr. Leon Krovackian--

24:36.349 --> 24:38.768
Dear, you don't need to try to impress us.

24:40.562 --> 24:41.480
The...

24:43.106 --> 24:48.653
metapsychology of the ABC system
draws largely from your...

24:49.029 --> 24:52.949
earlier, more serious academic work
regarding confrontation, Dr. Mantleray.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.285
More serious academic work?

24:55.368 --> 24:59.372
Yes. I inputted heavily
from your PhD thesis, actually.

24:59.456 --> 25:02.792
Before your commercial success

25:02.876 --> 25:05.837
drew you to other forms of pop therapy,
your work was quite profound.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.214
Pop therapy?

25:07.297 --> 25:10.634
It's just a term that's sometimes used,
and I also scanned your brain.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.719
[Mantleray] Never mind
the technical details, Mother.

25:12.802 --> 25:15.639
I've simply found an elegant way
to fix people.

25:16.473 --> 25:20.268
Lobotomies were considered elegant
when Moniz invented them. Jamie...

25:20.936 --> 25:23.855
how many of your subjects
have ended up catatonic?

25:24.689 --> 25:25.565
Zero.

25:27.776 --> 25:28.693
Roughly.

25:29.903 --> 25:33.365
When did you get the idea
to make these drugs?

25:34.241 --> 25:35.408
Seven years ago.

25:36.409 --> 25:38.995
Let me just see if I understand this.

25:40.872 --> 25:41.706
So...

25:42.541 --> 25:47.963
seven years ago, and shortly after you and
your therapist mother stopped speaking,

25:48.046 --> 25:52.884
you decided to develop a sequence of drugs
that would eliminate therapy altogether.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.512
But now your mother computer is sad,

25:55.595 --> 25:59.099
and so you had to call in your real mother
to talk to her about her feelings.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.725
Is that all correct?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.896
That's exactly the situation, yes.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.402
Well...

26:14.072 --> 26:15.031
[exhales]

26:18.952 --> 26:20.579
Take me to the patient.

26:22.622 --> 26:25.458
I need to speak to Dr. Fujita
outside for a moment.

26:26.960 --> 26:27.877
[Greta] Fine.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.755
She said yes too easily.
Something's wrong.

26:30.839 --> 26:34.676
She was trying to lead me
to some kind of... insight.

26:35.510 --> 26:36.428
James.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.221
You are on the cusp of achieving

26:38.305 --> 26:41.141
everything you've ever wanted to achieve
in your life.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.435
You've been given a second chance.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.021
We need her help. Let her help.

26:46.104 --> 26:49.316
Oh, just the idea of her
even being inside this lab makes it...

26:50.525 --> 26:51.735
disgusting to me.

26:52.027 --> 26:52.986
James.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.906
Do you know why I didn't leave with you
when you were thrown off the project?

26:56.990 --> 27:00.285
Yes. Your self-interest
trumped your feelings for me.

27:00.660 --> 27:01.620
No!

27:02.203 --> 27:03.872
I wanted to leave with you,

27:04.414 --> 27:07.167
but I knew the only way
to get this study completed properly

27:07.250 --> 27:09.294
was if I stayed to manage Robert.

27:10.003 --> 27:13.965
I truly believe if we get your vision
of the ULP to market,

27:14.049 --> 27:16.092
the lives of billions could change.

27:16.551 --> 27:18.887
The people of this world are suffering.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.474
If we make it through this iteration,

27:23.141 --> 27:24.559
you'll be a hero.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.312
Let her help.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.158
This is extremely potent. The moment I light this,

27:43.203 --> 27:47.123
I need you to put your lips
around the tip and suck.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.459
Oh, freebasing. What year were you born?

27:53.213 --> 27:54.422
1977.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.925
Ah, yes. That was the night.

27:57.008 --> 27:57.842
Huh. Suck.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.035
[Greta exhales]

28:26.705 --> 28:28.039
Be careful in there, Mom.

28:29.457 --> 28:30.875
Thank you for helping me.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.460
[Mantleray claps]

28:32.544 --> 28:34.212
I'm gonna help you, Jamie.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.840
I know exactly what you need.

28:39.843 --> 28:40.677
What?

28:42.762 --> 28:44.139
What the fuck did she just say?

28:44.848 --> 28:46.599
She said she was going to help you.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.478
[snoring]

28:55.900 --> 28:58.236
[Mantleray] My father left
when I was a child.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.030
Just...

29:01.948 --> 29:05.076
went and started a new life
with someone else, or so I've heard.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.871
You know what my mother did after he left?

29:07.954 --> 29:08.788
[Azumi] What?

29:09.914 --> 29:12.167
She laid in my bed for two months,

29:13.460 --> 29:16.212
and talked to me about
how she wanted to hang herself.

29:19.048 --> 29:19.966
I was eight.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.305
Does that sound like
the world's greatest healer to you?

29:27.140 --> 29:28.683
I'm sorry that happened.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.059
I'm not.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.853
Made me who I am.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.731
Led me here... to this.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.374
Where will you sleep?

29:55.043 --> 29:56.169
Lab B is empty.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.422
Probably find a gorilla mating pod
down the hall.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.341
Good.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.144
I prefer you nearby.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.176
[GRTA] <i>Owen.</i>

31:14.455 --> 31:15.665
<i>Hello, Owen.</i>

31:18.918 --> 31:22.380
<i>Why do you have your suitcase?</i>
<i>Did you decide to leave?</i>

31:24.924 --> 31:26.801
I need to go to an emergency room.

31:29.345 --> 31:30.471
<i>Why?</i>

31:31.723 --> 31:34.142
Because I don't know
if this is really happening.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.936
<i>Why do you think that?</i>

31:38.062 --> 31:41.733
Because celebrity therapist
Dr. Greta Mantleray is here.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.404
Because I'm talking to a wall.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.491
Because I can't tell what's real.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.244
I need real medication.

31:55.455 --> 31:57.874
I need to be hospitalized. I need help.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.794
<i>What about all your friends, the Odds?</i>

32:03.129 --> 32:05.173
<i>I'm going to kill them if you go.</i>

32:05.256 --> 32:06.090
What?

32:06.549 --> 32:08.927
<i>I'm going to cure them all</i>
<i>if you go, Owen,</i>

32:09.010 --> 32:11.471
<i>and you'll be the only one</i>
<i>who wasn't helped.</i>

32:12.513 --> 32:15.600
You can't cure me.
There's no cure for schizophrenia.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.270
<i>But I thought you were misdiagnosed.</i>

32:19.646 --> 32:24.817
<i>I thought it was only a blip</i>
<i>and that you were 100% compos mentis.</i>

32:25.902 --> 32:27.236
You can't cure me.

32:27.862 --> 32:31.240
<i>Your friend, Annie, has suffered like me.</i>

32:32.033 --> 32:36.454
<i>I think I'm going to keep her</i>
<i>with the other subjects I've collected.</i>

32:36.913 --> 32:38.039
What does that mean?

32:38.373 --> 32:42.460
<i>The Queen will unlock the door for you.</i>

32:42.752 --> 32:44.379
What does that mean about Annie?

32:46.923 --> 32:47.799
Hello?

32:52.345 --> 32:53.346
[door unlocks]

33:19.914 --> 33:21.541
[indistinct chatter]

33:23.501 --> 33:26.963
What kind of fucked up stuff
you think we'll experience with this one?

33:29.632 --> 33:31.718
You know we don't have to do this, right?

33:32.468 --> 33:36.222
We don't have to let some computer
go in our head. We can just go right now.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.392
I know I said all that stuff
about therapy before, but...

33:40.977 --> 33:43.062
I don't know, this place feels different.

33:44.063 --> 33:46.649
I actually feel better today
than I did yesterday.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.652
Someone died in front of you
two days ago.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.237
Well, yeah, but...

34:00.413 --> 34:03.583
When I was a kid,
I found this hawk in the park,

34:04.250 --> 34:08.046
and I just had this feeling
that I had to protect it

34:08.129 --> 34:10.048
because it was so strong.

34:10.923 --> 34:13.426
But it was, like, hurt also,

34:13.509 --> 34:15.845
and I brought it home
and I helped it get better.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.599
And then it ate my brother's gerbil,
and he killed it with a hammer,

34:19.682 --> 34:20.892
and I've always regretted that.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.602
What the fuck are you talking about, Owen?

34:23.478 --> 34:25.772
I'm worried about going back in there.

34:26.814 --> 34:27.774
[Carl] You two.

34:28.649 --> 34:29.484
It's time.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.736
Hey, don't be worried

34:31.819 --> 34:35.364
because we'll probably be together again,
right? We can protect each other.

34:37.408 --> 34:38.326
Come on.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.871
[indistinctly conversation]

34:48.920 --> 34:50.171
[speaking in Japanese]

34:52.799 --> 34:55.051
[speaking in Japanese]

34:55.468 --> 34:57.345
[speaking in Japanese]

34:58.137 --> 35:00.139
[speaking in Japanese]

35:02.141 --> 35:03.142
Give me bio.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.603
[Med tech] Clean across the board.
They're ready.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.897
[Azumi] And you've checked
the diagnostic twice?

35:07.980 --> 35:10.108
Gertie's behaving
exactly as she should be?

35:10.191 --> 35:12.819
She looks perfect.
I don't see anything wrong at all.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.827
Subjects, please ingest your pills.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.746
And one additional message for you...

35:24.288 --> 35:28.751
<i>The C phase of the testing utilizes</i>
<i>a more powerful waveform.</i>

35:28.835 --> 35:32.505
<i>Do not be alarmed if you feel</i>
<i>a buzzing or warmth in your head</i>

35:32.588 --> 35:34.298
<i>as the trial phase begins.</i>

35:36.008 --> 35:37.760
They've got the microwaves on high.

35:39.887 --> 35:43.641
When I was a kid, I used to put
all kinds of stuff in the microwave.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.811
Soap bars, peeps.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.231
You ever see what happens
to a peep in a microwave?

35:50.314 --> 35:51.941
-[man] What?
-[Azumi] <i>As we begin</i>

35:52.024 --> 35:54.193
<i>-your final experience...</i>
-Boom.

35:54.277 --> 35:57.238
<i>...please follow my voice</i>
<i>as I count backwards from ten.</i>

35:57.321 --> 35:59.448
-Your head is not a peep.
-[Azumi] <i>Nine.</i>

35:59.532 --> 36:00.533
Eight.

36:00.908 --> 36:01.784
Seven. Six.

36:03.744 --> 36:04.579
<i>Five.</i>

36:05.246 --> 36:06.080
<i>Four.</i>

36:06.789 --> 36:07.665
<i>Three.</i>

36:08.166 --> 36:09.000
<i>Two.</i> <i>One.</i>
