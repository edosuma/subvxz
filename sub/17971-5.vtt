I love minor league baseball.

Nothing like watching a bunch
of people I've never heard of

00:38.572 --> 00:39.838
not play very well.

Bottom of the eighth,
one-nothing.

00:55.289 --> 00:58.757
Too bad we were
in the bathroom
for that home run.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.160
I'm sorry I needed you
to hold my arms, Daddy,

01:01.162 --> 01:04.096
but I didn't want to sit
on the wet seat.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.064
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.298
Having good time
at the ballgame.

It's time for the Kiss Cam,

Ooh, chocolate-vanilla swirl,

Ha! You get it, man!

01:31.025 --> 01:33.992
They're gonna make
a baby Derek Jeter.

01:34.727 --> 01:41.100
(snickers)
Cleveland, it's your hot
stepdaughter and her boyfriend.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.902
Oh. Hey, what year
was she born again?

01:43.904 --> 01:45.871
She's not born again.

01:45.873 --> 01:49.241
Born-agains are crazy
and off-putting.

Hold my beer, Rallo.

Cleveland, what is it?!

02:06.327 --> 02:09.628
It's Roberta,
and it's bad!

02:09.630 --> 02:11.029
Really bad!

02:11.031 --> 02:12.297
Oh, my God,
what, Cleveland?!

02:12.299 --> 02:16.135
This afternoon--
(panting) I'm sorry.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.169
I ran up the stairs.

Where's Roberta?!
(panting
and groaning)

02:20.608 --> 02:24.910
I'm gonna need...
that glass of water.

02:24.912 --> 02:25.878
(gulps)

02:25.880 --> 02:29.448
This afternoon at the baseball
game, Roberta and Federline

02:29.450 --> 02:34.620
were all over each other,
groping, squeezing, petting,

02:34.622 --> 02:36.155
dry-humping, tongues wagging,

02:36.157 --> 02:39.625
probably causing a dot
on his underpants.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.392
Oh, it was bad.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.828
They were making out
at the ball game?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.930
That's it?
Cleveland, Roberta's fine.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.031
She's a teenager.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.234
That's why I've already had
the safe-sex talk with her,

02:49.236 --> 02:50.969
in case she does
make that choice.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.739
Donna, your idea
of safe sex is why

02:53.741 --> 02:55.307
Roberta's here today.

02:55.309 --> 02:58.610
Nasty, nasty Roberta.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.081
Mmm, good sundaes.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.284
Roberta, do you know
what a hymen is?

03:05.286 --> 03:08.287
That Jewish guy that works
at the video store?

03:08.289 --> 03:09.087
That's right.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.622
And you know
what he told me?

03:10.624 --> 03:14.193
He told me that
a young woman's
virginity is precious.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.394
Please stay
a virgin, Roberta.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.396
What?! I've overheard
you with your friends

03:17.398 --> 03:21.900
bragging about how many
girls you slept with
in high school.

03:21.902 --> 03:22.768
True,

03:22.770 --> 03:25.103
but they were terrible women.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.371
Most of them are dead!

03:26.373 --> 03:28.941
Fed and I aren't even
doing anything that bad,

03:28.943 --> 03:33.345
and what we <i>ares</i> doing is
none of your damn business!

03:33.347 --> 03:34.980
How about that, huh?

03:34.982 --> 03:39.885
Kids today. Just makes you think
about our country's values.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.520
Have we lost our way?

03:41.522 --> 03:45.057
Heck, did we ever
even have our way?

03:45.059 --> 03:49.461
Time was, everybody knew
everybody else.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.231
People said hello,
and they meant it.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.200
Folks went to bed
at a decent time,

03:55.202 --> 03:58.103
and jeans were only worn
by prisoners.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.105
Someone would invite you over
for coffee,

04:00.107 --> 04:02.808
and you'd wind up talking
for eight straight days.

04:02.810 --> 04:07.312
Some people think this modern
society's an improvement.

04:07.314 --> 04:14.019
My question is:
"An improvement on what?"

04:14.021 --> 04:17.155
(audience cheers, applauds)

04:19.092 --> 04:21.860
(cheering, applause continues)

04:29.335 --> 04:32.137
Roberta, please pass me
the olive oil.

04:32.139 --> 04:36.008
The extra-virgin kind,
not the regular kind

04:36.010 --> 04:37.075
that is not virgin

04:37.077 --> 04:39.177
and therefore is
a lesser olive oil

04:39.179 --> 04:41.179
because the flavor
has been tainted,

04:41.181 --> 04:43.782
causing it to be gross
and much cheaper

04:43.784 --> 04:45.284
since nobody wants it.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.486
May I be excused,
Mother?

04:47.488 --> 04:48.887
Yes, you may.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.389
Cleveland, what do you
think you're doing?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.824
I told you I'd
taken care of this.

04:52.826 --> 04:53.925
I know you think
you did,

04:53.927 --> 04:56.361
but every girl needs
a man to tell her

04:56.363 --> 04:57.796
what to do with her body.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.031
That's just
common sense.

04:59.033 --> 05:02.567
Why is it so important for
Roberta to be a virgin, Daddy?

05:02.569 --> 05:04.036
Well, thank you,
Cleveland, Jr.

05:04.038 --> 05:07.539
If I told you that you
could open up a new soda pop

05:07.541 --> 05:11.410
or drink one that had
had seven penises in it,

05:11.412 --> 05:12.878
which one would
you prefer?

05:12.880 --> 05:15.213
I would probably go
with the new soda pop

05:15.215 --> 05:17.215
'cause the other one
might have blood in it.

05:17.217 --> 05:21.687
"Because the other one
might have blood in it."

05:23.122 --> 05:25.424
You know, you know, Cleveland,
for, for centuries

05:25.426 --> 05:27.859
the Christian church
has been frowning on sex

05:27.861 --> 05:28.960
and other fun things.

05:28.962 --> 05:33.432
Our pastor is giving a sermon
on teen abstinence this Sunday.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.433
You-you should come

05:34.435 --> 05:37.202
and bring that
slutty stepdaughter of yours.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.504
I think that's
a great idea.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.273
Any other new business?

05:41.275 --> 05:43.842
Then we're adjourned.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.177
(gavel bangs)

05:46.112 --> 05:49.081
(church bell tolling)

05:51.050 --> 05:52.884
What are these people wearing?

05:52.886 --> 05:56.888
RALLO:
It's like they're going
to a happy funeral.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.190
Oh, the pageantry!

05:58.192 --> 06:00.992
My humble sweater vest
looks foolish amongst

06:00.994 --> 06:04.529
these fancy hats of fruit,
feathers and foliage.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.431
I need to go to the haberdasher.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.868
Let me get a hookup from
my man Donovan McNabb.

06:09.870 --> 06:14.005
Uh, Philadelphia. Residence.

06:14.007 --> 06:17.409
Donovan McNabb.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.378
"Not listed"?

06:19.380 --> 06:21.947
Dallas, Texas. Residence.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.916
Michael Irving.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.518
Connect me.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.620
Yo, playmaker, it's Rallo.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.056
Listen, man, I need a hookup
on a suit.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.392
Rallo, your phone's
made of chocolate.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.327
<i>You're</i> smade of chocolate.

06:35.329 --> 06:36.461
Sorry about that, Michael.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.130
Michael? Oh, man, he hung up.

06:38.132 --> 06:42.300
Probably went to go stab
a guy in the neck with scissors.

06:42.302 --> 06:46.271
(organ plays gospel music)

06:46.273 --> 06:49.241
May the peace of the Lord
be with you.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.041
ALL:
Holla!

06:50.043 --> 06:53.478
Today's word is about
resisting temptation,

06:53.480 --> 06:57.883
about calming those fires
that burn in our loins.

06:57.885 --> 06:58.483
ALL:
Mm-hmm.

06:58.485 --> 07:02.354
Those fires that can lead
to destruction in our lives

07:02.356 --> 07:04.823
and turn promise
into despair.

07:04.825 --> 07:08.860
ALL:
♪ Come on. Ease on down,
ease on down the road. ♪

07:08.862 --> 07:10.328
All right, look, look,
at this point,

07:10.330 --> 07:13.265
I gotta ask the congregation
to please refrain from shouting

07:13.267 --> 07:16.001
stereotypical responses
and/or catchphrases

07:16.003 --> 07:17.002
to everything I say.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.336
ALL:
Oh... snap!

07:18.338 --> 07:21.573
(groans) All right,
let us turn to a reading

07:21.575 --> 07:25.010
of the letter of Chlamydias
to the Gonorrheans:

07:25.012 --> 07:27.679
Teenage sex is yuck city.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.248
It leadeth to pregnancy,

07:30.250 --> 07:35.887
obesity, illiteracy
and diseasacy.

07:35.889 --> 07:36.455
Gross!

07:36.457 --> 07:39.558
But there is a hope
all across this great land.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.328
Teenagers are taking a pledge--
the purity pledge--

07:43.330 --> 07:47.032
to hand over their virginity
to their fathers,

07:47.034 --> 07:49.167
the high priests of the home.

07:49.169 --> 07:49.601
Hear that?

07:49.603 --> 07:51.503
I'm the high priest
of our home.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.939
I would like
roast beef for dinner.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.273
Shut the (bleep) up!

07:55.275 --> 07:57.609
So I ask who here will be saved

07:57.611 --> 08:00.545
and take this honorable
purity pledge?

08:00.547 --> 08:04.516
I will. I, Brandy Young,
pledge my virginity to my dad!

08:04.518 --> 08:09.321
I, Jocelyn Beokabatuka,
pledge my virginity to my dad.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.224
I, Laura Davis, pledge
my virginity to my dad.

08:12.226 --> 08:15.560
Roberta, I'd very much
like your virginity.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.362
Give me it!
Give me it!

08:17.364 --> 08:18.330
Give me your virginity!

08:18.332 --> 08:22.133
I, Cleveland Brown, Jr.,
pledge my virginity to my dad,

08:22.135 --> 08:24.536
Cleveland Brown.
- What?

08:24.538 --> 08:26.371
ALL:
No, he di'int!

08:26.373 --> 08:31.142
(chuckling): This place,
always something.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.447
And the best part is,
the Reverend says

08:35.449 --> 08:38.283
the girls and I get
to go to a purity ball...

08:38.285 --> 08:39.718
(growls)

08:39.720 --> 08:41.620
...with our dads!

08:41.622 --> 08:42.554
(growls louder)

08:42.556 --> 08:43.989
We gotta go shopping,
Daddy,

08:43.991 --> 08:46.658
so we can get
matching suits.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.462
(growl turns
to laughter)

08:50.464 --> 08:51.530
Aah!

08:51.532 --> 08:54.132
Junior, we're not
going to that dance.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.367
What's wrong, Cleveland?

08:55.369 --> 08:57.068
You don't like balls

08:57.070 --> 08:59.538
as much as your son
likes balls?

08:59.540 --> 09:01.506
(chuckles)
You know what, Junior?

09:01.508 --> 09:04.175
You and your dad
should go to that dance,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.545
because teenage chastity
is so important,

09:06.547 --> 09:08.046
Isn't that why
you took us

09:08.048 --> 09:09.114
to church today,
Cleveland?

09:09.116 --> 09:12.317
Oh, man, this is going
even worse than when I invented

09:12.319 --> 09:14.252
that portable shoe toilet.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.855
(water sloshes in shoe toilet)

09:16.857 --> 09:18.590
Well, it saved me a trip
to the bathroom,

09:18.592 --> 09:23.128
but now I'm gonna have to worry
about spilling it all day.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.130
(water sloshing)

09:25.132 --> 09:26.164
(running footsteps)

09:26.166 --> 09:28.266
Oh, thank God!
(unzips pants)

09:28.268 --> 09:29.568
Oh, boy!

09:31.504 --> 09:35.307
Hey, morning, Cleveland.
How was your weekend?

09:35.309 --> 09:35.740
Fine.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.643
Do anything special?
Football game?

09:38.645 --> 09:39.311
Sunday brunch?

09:39.313 --> 09:42.581
No, he got humiliated
at church by his son

09:42.583 --> 09:44.649
pledging his virginity
to him.

09:44.651 --> 09:45.550
(all laugh)

09:45.552 --> 09:48.753
I'm, I'm sorry.
I-I had to tell them.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.823
LESTER: Well, if it ain't
the virgin father!

09:51.825 --> 09:52.624
And him.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.359
Hey, Cleveland,
<i>Brokeback Mountain,</i>

09:54.361 --> 09:56.127
that's your son.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.429
(all laugh)

09:57.431 --> 09:58.229
And-and him.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.798
You guys don't even work here.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.500
How come Security didn't
stop you on the way in?

10:02.502 --> 10:05.503
We took a break
so we could laugh
at your gay son.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.172
(all laugh)

10:07.174 --> 10:10.175
Now wait just a cotton-pickin'
minute, Tim.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.643
Church was <i>your</i> idea.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.846
You're the one who said
Jesus hates sex.

10:14.848 --> 10:15.647
What, are you nuts?

10:15.649 --> 10:18.617
Jesus wants to keep the females
pure, not the males.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.853
You-you think he died
so that men don't have sex?

10:21.855 --> 10:25.156
That-that's the stupidest thing
I ever heard.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.591
Hey, hey, everybody, I'm Jesus

10:26.593 --> 10:28.360
and I'm gonna die
a painful death

10:28.362 --> 10:30.428
so none of you dudes get laid.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.465
Yeah, yeah, like, like,
I'm gonna pray to this guy.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.667
(all laughing)

10:37.737 --> 10:39.771
You want my cherry, Dad?

10:39.773 --> 10:40.772
Sure.

10:40.774 --> 10:44.509
Junior, a boy's virginity
is a terrible burden,

10:44.511 --> 10:48.446
and it must be cast off
on any girl who will take it.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.949
But the Reverend says
premarital sex will make

10:50.951 --> 10:53.218
your genitals
and your soul burn.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.321
Oh, boys don't get
most of the bad diseases.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.123
And if you get herpes,
who cares?

10:58.125 --> 11:01.292
80% of food preparers
in this country have herpes.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.295
Daddy, do you want me
to get herpes?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.965
I want you to
at least try.

11:08.434 --> 11:11.670
I guess I'll have
to scare some sense into you.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.806
Junior, if you don't
give up your pledge,

11:14.808 --> 11:16.608
you'll end up like this.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.542
(robotic beeping)

11:17.544 --> 11:23.248
Behold the terrible, ugly
consequences of male virginity!

11:23.250 --> 11:24.716
Oh, cool. Is that Worf?

11:24.718 --> 11:27.585
I apologize for that
confusing example.

11:27.587 --> 11:31.222
I forgot that virgins have so
much free time on their hands,

11:31.224 --> 11:34.259
they end up having some
pretty neat hobbies.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.629
(creaking)

11:37.631 --> 11:40.532
Junior, go play with
your action figures.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.533
Remembering, of course,

11:41.535 --> 11:43.968
to leave them in their
original packaging.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.737
I'll be right in.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.240
Roberta, will you please
leave us alone?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.710
Don't hurt him, Cleveland!

11:52.478 --> 11:54.679
Ah, not the grill, yo.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.014
Put your arms down, fool.

11:56.016 --> 11:59.551
Look, even though you're nothing
but a lame inside-out Oreo,

11:59.553 --> 12:02.487
you seem to have a certain way
with the ladies.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.090
And as someone close
to Cleveland Jr.'s age,

12:05.092 --> 12:09.561
I think you can help him realize
the joys of being around girls.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.463
Federline, will
you help me?

12:11.465 --> 12:13.932
Aw, blap!
You flipped the script!

12:13.934 --> 12:16.000
Script flip!
Ooh-ooh!

12:16.002 --> 12:17.268
I don't--
What?

12:17.270 --> 12:18.269
Script flip.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.572
See, now you need
something from me, Pops,

12:20.574 --> 12:21.973
and it's gonna cost you.

12:21.975 --> 12:22.607
What do you want?

12:22.609 --> 12:26.111
I want to be able to bring
my brown sugar home at 1:00 am.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.213
Not no 10:30 pm, yo.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.815
Midnight. Take
it or leave it.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.119
Ho-Ho-Hold up, Pops.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.653
Ain't nobody getting
off this whip

12:35.655 --> 12:37.489
without dropping
some freestyle.

12:37.491 --> 12:38.590
You know what I'm sayin'.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.525

Nick, nack, paddy wack,
crack-a-lack, Jack!

13:54.201 --> 13:56.267
I'm out.

13:58.404 --> 14:01.906
All right, so your Pops want me
to put you up on game, right?

14:01.908 --> 14:02.740
You see them shorties?

14:02.742 --> 14:06.077
Go up and twist your fingers
all up, like, "Westside!"

14:06.079 --> 14:07.478
And be like,
"What up, hoes?"

14:07.480 --> 14:09.647
Then make them
give you $40.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.187
(girl sobbing)

14:16.189 --> 14:18.623
Yeah, so what happened
with the fly honeys?

14:18.625 --> 14:21.993
Well, I called them all whores,
like you said

14:21.995 --> 14:24.662
and then I explained
what happens to whores.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.130
And that made them sad,

14:26.132 --> 14:28.166
but I told them
how they could be saved,

14:28.168 --> 14:30.335
like I was
with the purity pledge,

14:30.337 --> 14:32.770
and then they gave me $22.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.706
That's all they had.

14:36.408 --> 14:37.675
I might be a virgin,

14:37.677 --> 14:41.646
but I'll kick your ass
if you do that again.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.283
Hey, Cleveland.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.452
<i>The Birdcage?</i>
<i>That's your son.</i>

14:47.454 --> 14:48.720
(laughing)

14:48.722 --> 14:49.854
(Cleveland chuckling sadly)

14:49.856 --> 14:51.189
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.224
Rebecca Gayheart,
that's your son.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.260
(all laughing)

14:55.262 --> 14:57.395
Hey, Lester, give
me a hot sausage.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.563
(chuckles)

14:58.565 --> 15:00.198
That is what she <i>didn'ts</i> say

15:00.200 --> 15:01.733
when she was with your son.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.001
(all laughing)

15:03.003 --> 15:04.402
Okay, okay. I got one.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.671
"I'm Cleveland Jr.

15:06.673 --> 15:09.774
"Oh, no, my wiener
fell off and broke.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.309
"Oh, that's okay.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.577
I don't need it."

15:12.579 --> 15:14.979
(laughing)

15:16.715 --> 15:20.184
I'm not that broken sausage.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.286
(sobbing)

15:21.288 --> 15:23.421
(sniffling)

15:23.423 --> 15:24.722
Don't cry, Junior.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.792
I want to lose my virginity
so my daddy will love me.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.128
Listen, my dad
goes to this place.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.030
Sometimes he has me
wait in the car,

15:32.032 --> 15:33.498
but I looked through
the windows once,

15:33.500 --> 15:38.269
and I saw people doing all sorts
of naked things to each other.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.170
I'm telling you,

15:39.172 --> 15:40.838
it was like
a live Internet.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.840
Will they take
my virginity?

15:42.842 --> 15:44.776
For $35,
they'll take anything

15:44.778 --> 15:46.210
<i>and</i> sgive you herpes.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.413
My dad loves herpes!

15:49.481 --> 15:51.382
(snoring)

15:51.384 --> 15:54.218
(exhaling squeakily)

15:54.220 --> 15:55.453
(snoring)

15:55.455 --> 15:59.057
I hope I'm
her first, too.

16:07.433 --> 16:08.666
Hey, fellas.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.734
Deviled egg, anyone?

16:09.736 --> 16:11.302
Kendra, there's deviled eggs.

16:11.304 --> 16:15.073
You want to marinate 'em
in your folds or eat 'em as is?

16:15.075 --> 16:16.607
I can't get out there.

16:16.609 --> 16:20.078
Somebody done
stole my Rascal.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.412
Probably some bla--

16:21.414 --> 16:22.814
(coughing)

16:22.816 --> 16:23.748
I'll come and help you.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.283
Hey, I brought these eggs
for Junior.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.719
Where is he? He said
he was coming over here.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.153
I haven't seen him.

16:29.155 --> 16:29.821
The Rascal's gone.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.790
And the money's missing
from the whore jar.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.691
Whore jar?

16:33.693 --> 16:36.494
It's where a man keeps
his money for prostitutes.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.162
I bet Ernie took it.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.831
Ernie! Where the hell are you?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.699
(snaps fingers)
Wait a minute.

16:41.701 --> 16:45.703
If Cleveland Junior's not
here and Ernie's not here,

16:45.705 --> 16:47.672
and the Rascal's gone...

16:47.674 --> 16:48.706
And money designated

16:48.708 --> 16:50.375
specifically for prostitutes
is missing...

16:50.377 --> 16:53.411
Then Cleveland Jr. must have
overhead us making fun of him.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.514
And he and Ernie decided
to hotwire the Rascal

16:56.516 --> 16:58.416
and take the money
to the whorehouse

16:58.418 --> 17:02.353
to lose their virginities
and regain your respect.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.287
She's right.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.689
Good job, Mystery Bunch.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.558
Lester and I
will take it from here.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.627
Portal!

17:18.537 --> 17:19.604
(sniffing)

17:19.606 --> 17:21.372
Yep. That's my Kendra.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.709
Hey, Velvet.
Hey, Mabel.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.710
Hey, Xianhanxinganwa.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.845
You whores seen a couple of
kids snooping around here?

17:27.847 --> 17:30.982
Are you looking for the guy
that's about this wide,

17:30.984 --> 17:33.518
uh, he look like
he could be your son?

17:33.520 --> 17:34.318
Yes, I am.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.721
Oh, he up with One-Arm Mavis.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.689
Oh. Well,
he's in good hand.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.626
Wait, he's with
Two-Virgine Marlene.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.661
Oh, no. Not
Two-Virgine Marlene.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.898
He's got a 50-50 chance
of getting gonorrhea.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.268
Bubblegum, bubblegum, in a dish.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.905
How many pieces
do you... Dad!

17:53.907 --> 17:55.606
Junior! Ugh!

17:55.608 --> 17:57.341
Come on. We're
getting out of here.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.609
No. I'm not going.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.645
I'm going to stay here
and see this through,

18:00.647 --> 18:03.247
so you won't be ashamed
of me anymore.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.582
I'm not ashamed of you.

18:04.584 --> 18:08.886
Well, I was, but that
wasn't right. I see that now.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.389
Oh, Junior, this isn't
how I wanted you

18:11.391 --> 18:12.857
to experience
your first time.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.460
I thought maybe it'd be
in the back of your car,

18:15.462 --> 18:18.896
or behind the bleachers, or in
the woods on a pile of leaves

18:18.898 --> 18:20.398
with a blanket tossed on top,

18:20.400 --> 18:23.968
with a girl who has to get up
every few minutes to throw up.

18:23.970 --> 18:27.038
The point is,
it should be a beautiful thing,

18:27.040 --> 18:30.374
and it will be--
when you're ready.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.610
So, you're not ashamed of me?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.644
No.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.480
Yes, you are.

18:36.715 --> 18:39.517
Cleveland Jr., will
you do me the honor

18:39.519 --> 18:42.420
of being my date
at the purity ball?

18:42.422 --> 18:42.954
Really?

18:42.956 --> 18:46.457
I can do you both
right here, right now

18:46.459 --> 18:47.859
for 40 bucks.

18:47.861 --> 18:48.759
You know what?

18:48.761 --> 18:51.796
Aside from the fact that
I'm a happily married man

18:51.798 --> 18:52.763
and that this is my son,

18:52.765 --> 18:55.366
there's no way he
and I could do that

18:55.368 --> 18:57.034
without crossing
drumsticks.

18:57.036 --> 19:01.305
So, thank you,
ma'am, but no thanks.
