04:55.580 --> 04:57.500
It probably doesn't feel great.

04:59.620 --> 05:01.330
They're going to be fine.

05:01.330 --> 05:02.710
You just over-watered them.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.710

05:16.790 --> 05:18.670
That's a good thing,
right, two first names?

05:18.670 --> 05:20.790
Yeah. It's fun when
you go to the movies

05:20.790 --> 05:23.670
and you stay for the credits
and look for the people
with two first names.

05:23.670 --> 05:25.670

05:25.670 --> 05:27.080

05:56.830 --> 05:58.420
I'm fine.

05:59.540 --> 06:01.540
You don't have to put on
a brave face for me.

06:01.540 --> 06:05.670
I know about Jonah
and his new "friend,"
the flying disc wench.

06:05.670 --> 06:07.580
They really are just friends.

06:07.580 --> 06:08.920
And you believe that?

06:08.920 --> 06:10.710
Shouldn't you be
spilling a drink on a customer?

06:10.710 --> 06:13.960
When I was with Jonah,
he told me the exact same thing.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.380
That you were just a friend.

06:16.380 --> 06:17.920
Because we were.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.880
And then we...

06:21.080 --> 06:23.620
Look, I really don't want
to talk about this with you.

06:23.620 --> 06:24.710
I have to admit,

06:24.710 --> 06:26.670
it's nice not being
the jealous one.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.830
I'm not jealous.

06:29.830 --> 06:32.920
I'm okay that Jonah
has a friend.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.790
I really am.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.920
Andi, I know we've had
our differences,

06:39.920 --> 06:42.670
but I'm on your side here.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.380
Somehow that doesn't
make it any better.

06:45.380 --> 06:48.040
We both know that Jonah's
a heartbreaker.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.920
I've been through it
and it's not fun.

06:50.920 --> 06:56.040
All I'm saying is
if you need a shoulder,
and you will...

07:16.040 --> 07:19.920
So where are we eating?
Table or floor?

07:19.920 --> 07:22.460
We haven't had
a floor picnic in a while.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.620
It really is
hard to refuse you.

07:25.620 --> 07:28.330
Yes! (shouting):
Andi, floor picnic!

07:28.330 --> 07:29.670
(shouting):
Bring pillows!

07:34.540 --> 07:36.880
So I heard you met Miranda.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.000
I think it was
like at first sight.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.750
-Really?
-You know,
I came so close

07:40.750 --> 07:41.960
to asking her
to be my friend,

07:41.960 --> 07:44.330
but you can't do that
on the first conversation,
right?

07:44.330 --> 07:46.500
-It's too early.
-(chuckles) She liked you too.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.920
Really?

07:47.920 --> 07:50.290
What are you
so happy about?

07:50.290 --> 07:52.290
What are you
so unhappy about?

07:52.290 --> 07:53.960
I asked you first.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.750
I made a friend today.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.420
Everybody's making friends.

07:58.420 --> 08:01.710
Meet the new friends,
better than the old friends.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.960
Finally got her to listen
to some of my music.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.880
-Huh!
-Nice!

08:05.880 --> 08:06.960
Can I ask you something?

08:06.960 --> 08:08.920
Yeah.

08:08.920 --> 08:12.960
What exactly does it mean
when a guy says that a girl
is "just a friend"?

08:14.460 --> 08:17.580
We saw Jonah
at The Spoon with a girl.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.000
Oh.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.880
Her name's Natalie,

08:20.880 --> 08:25.250
and she's the captain
of the Ultimate Team
at her school.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.460
If he says
they're just friends,

08:27.460 --> 08:29.000
they probably are.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.750
Yeah, well I'm really
not loving the word "probably."

08:32.750 --> 08:34.960
I'm just saying,
playing Frisbee

08:34.960 --> 08:37.620
isn't the most romantic way
to meet someone.

08:37.620 --> 08:40.330
That's how Jonah and I met.

08:40.330 --> 08:43.710
Lightning doesn't strike
in the same place twice.

08:43.710 --> 08:47.170
Yeah, well, he's a boy,
not the weather.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.290
And I'm not hungry.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.120
But--

08:55.880 --> 08:57.250
Why didn't you tell me?

08:57.250 --> 09:00.710
I'm sorry, I just
never thought she'd--

09:00.710 --> 09:01.920
Want my opinion?

09:02.920 --> 09:04.790
Your opinion
means a lot to her.

09:04.790 --> 09:06.460
I was gonna say,

09:06.460 --> 09:08.830
I never thought
she'd let you see
her embarrassed.

09:10.290 --> 09:11.750
-I'll go talk to her.
-No.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.420
I got this.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.380
Okay if I come in?

09:34.380 --> 09:36.040
You're in.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.380
Whatcha doin'?

09:44.380 --> 09:48.380
Saving me from myself.

09:48.380 --> 09:52.080
There's a video that I really
have to stop watching.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.080
Oh.

09:56.750 --> 10:01.380
Andi, I don't know
what's going on
in Jonah's head.

10:01.380 --> 10:03.960
But like you said,
he's a boy.

10:03.960 --> 10:08.620
And boys can be
pretty dumb.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.250
(chuckles)

10:10.250 --> 10:13.500
Sometimes, it takes us
a while to appreciate
what we have.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.750
But we get there.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.170
Okay?

10:24.330 --> 10:26.670
What difference
is this gonna make?

10:26.670 --> 10:29.000
Are you gonna
tape your phone too?

10:33.330 --> 10:35.880
-Oh. (laughs)
-(cell phone rings)

10:37.250 --> 10:39.250
-Now what are you gonna do?
-(continues ringing)

10:39.250 --> 10:41.710
I'm going to get it.

10:41.710 --> 10:43.040
-(ringing stops)
-Hello?

10:44.210 --> 10:45.420
Okay.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.330
What'd you find?

10:50.330 --> 10:52.290
Here's Natalie's FacePage.

10:52.290 --> 10:54.670
Whoa, picture of Jonah.

10:54.670 --> 10:56.080
Not good.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.290
(keyboard clacks)

10:58.290 --> 11:01.460
And now here's Jonah's FacePage.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.380
Notice, there's no pictures
of Natalie.

11:04.380 --> 11:06.750
Interesting.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.330
But here's the headline.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.170
Who's Furious George?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.540
According to the Ultimate Disc
Power rankings,

11:13.540 --> 11:15.880
one of the top ten
players in the world.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.460
And look where he's
going to be this afternoon.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.500
Right here in the park.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.000
Holding a master class
on trick shots.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.880
And look who signed up
to attend.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.540
Both of them.

11:29.540 --> 11:32.000
How do you feel
about doing some spy work?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.330
You kidding?

11:33.330 --> 11:35.040
I've already got
the trench coat and fedora

11:35.040 --> 11:36.170
hanging in my closet.

11:36.170 --> 11:38.460
We just need
your camera with the big lens.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.040
I love this! I feel like

11:40.040 --> 11:41.580
we're in one of those
old detective movies.

11:41.580 --> 11:42.750

-(Bex gasps)

12:48.170 --> 12:50.290
They're alive!

12:50.290 --> 12:52.000
Hey, Bowie Quinn.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.670
-That's me.
-Two first names.

12:53.670 --> 12:55.250
It's a nest.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.830
What's going on?

12:56.830 --> 12:59.080
Although his first name
is really a last name.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.710
That's true.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.250
Never mind, you're out.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.170
-Fine, don't tell me.
-(laughs)

13:04.170 --> 13:05.670
Hey, how can I help you?

13:05.670 --> 13:08.120
Hey, um,
if you're not too busy,

13:08.120 --> 13:10.750
I was thinking
maybe we could
get a coffee?

13:10.750 --> 13:12.920
And a donut?
I would love a donut.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.170
Good! Because when I say coffee,

13:15.170 --> 13:16.380
I really mean donut.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.620
(laughs)

13:17.620 --> 13:20.210
Hey, can I ask you something?

13:20.210 --> 13:22.620
-Bear claws.
-It's not donut related.

13:22.620 --> 13:24.290
Sorry, I am not
good with segues.

13:25.540 --> 13:27.460
You seem to know Bowie.

13:27.460 --> 13:28.830
You could say that.

13:30.330 --> 13:33.080
I can't believe I'm asking this,
this is so embarrassing,

13:33.080 --> 13:35.210
but do you know
if he's seeing anyone?

13:35.210 --> 13:37.880
Oh, um, I don't think so.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.170
'Cause I was thinking
I'd like to ask him out.

13:41.170 --> 13:43.330
Yeah.

13:43.330 --> 13:44.790
-Yeah?
-Go for it.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.120
Unless, are you
interested in him?

13:46.120 --> 13:47.420
No. No.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.120
-Mm-mm. No. No.
-No?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.210
Okay.

13:50.210 --> 13:52.290
What'd I miss?

13:52.290 --> 13:55.250
Nothing. I was just--
I was heading out.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.040
I thought we were
gonna get donuts?

13:57.040 --> 13:59.460
I-- I just remembered
I have this...

14:00.620 --> 14:02.330
Some other time.

14:02.330 --> 14:03.500
Okay.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.460
You wanna get a donut?
I can get a donut.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.500
Miranda: Great.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.580
-Yeah.
-All right.

14:29.170 --> 14:30.460
Hey, guys.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.330
What's up?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.290
You're going to want
to sit down.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.040
Why?

14:37.330 --> 14:38.750
Just trust me.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.580
Okay.

14:45.290 --> 14:46.500
Here's what's up.

14:47.790 --> 14:49.120
What's this?

14:50.380 --> 14:53.210
We did a little
surveillance work for you.

14:53.210 --> 14:54.920
What did you surveil?

14:54.920 --> 14:57.920
Jonah and Natalie.

14:57.920 --> 15:02.420
Checking out his
"she's just a friend" story.
See if it holds up.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.330
I didn't ask you to do that.

15:04.330 --> 15:05.960
You didn't have to ask.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.750
Just another service we provide.

15:09.210 --> 15:10.620
What's in the envelope?

15:10.620 --> 15:13.620
Everything you need to know.

15:13.620 --> 15:16.080
Well, I don't want
to open it. Just tell me.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.750
No, don't tell me!

15:17.750 --> 15:20.380
No, tell me!
Is it bad? Just tell me that.

15:20.380 --> 15:22.500
No, don't tell me anything.
I don't wanna know.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.880
I told you we shouldn't.

15:29.210 --> 15:30.960
There's nothing in it.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.120
Because we have
nothing to report.

15:34.830 --> 15:38.380
There was no flirting,
no prolonged eye contact.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.380
No physical contact either,

15:40.380 --> 15:41.830
apart from a single fist bump.

15:41.830 --> 15:44.540
So they really are
just friends?

15:44.540 --> 15:46.920
They really are, just friends.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.580
Well, why couldn't you
just tell me that?

15:48.580 --> 15:51.420
Why did you have to torture me
with a manila envelope?

15:51.420 --> 15:52.620
His idea.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.620
It's how
the movie detectives do it.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.330
Slide an envelope
to their client.

15:57.330 --> 16:01.420
I'm sorry. I had to pick
between this and him
wearing a fedora...

16:01.420 --> 16:02.920
if you can imagine.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.960
-(Andi laughs)
-(chuckles) Oh.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.880
She doesn't have to imagine.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.250
(whispers):
You made the right choice.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.880
(both laugh)

16:14.880 --> 16:17.420
Uh, hey, laugh all you want,

16:17.420 --> 16:19.540
but I think I look "fedorable."

16:22.920 --> 16:25.580
-You excited about
this afternoon?
-Are you kidding?

16:25.580 --> 16:27.170
Yeah, can you come?

16:27.170 --> 16:29.500
I was the one
who invited you.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.670
To what?

16:30.670 --> 16:32.120
The Grease sing-along?

16:32.120 --> 16:34.330
With the school?

16:34.330 --> 16:36.330
At the amphitheater?

16:36.330 --> 16:40.170
I asked you last week
if you wanted to go,
and you said yeah.

16:40.170 --> 16:41.830
Oh, right.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.000
What did you think
I was talking about?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.080
Natalie's making a video
for her web channel

16:47.080 --> 16:48.330
with this guy, Furious George,

16:48.330 --> 16:50.880
who's famous
in the Ultimate world.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.290
Oh, wow.

16:53.290 --> 16:55.880
She asked me to be in it,
and I said yes.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.170
I'm sorry,
that was so dumb.

16:58.170 --> 17:00.290
I'll tell Natalie
she has to find someone else.

17:00.290 --> 17:03.540
No, no. If it's
really important
to you, then--

17:03.540 --> 17:06.170
It's important,
but it's not really important.

17:06.170 --> 17:09.250
But if it's what
you'd rather do,
then that's what you should do.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.210
Well, you could come
to that if you want.

17:11.210 --> 17:13.250
Thanks, but, uh...

17:13.250 --> 17:14.790
You really want to do
the sing-along?

17:14.790 --> 17:17.500
Yeah, and you really
wanna do the video.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.250
So let's just both
do what we wanna do.

17:20.250 --> 17:22.750
Andiman, you're the best.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.540
Hm, that's what I aim for.

17:24.540 --> 17:25.830
(chuckles)

17:27.330 --> 17:28.830
(sighs)

17:36.380 --> 17:38.250
Got a minute?

17:39.210 --> 17:40.380
Of course you do.

17:43.420 --> 17:46.790
Andi is not
who you think she is.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.420
What does that mean?

17:48.420 --> 17:51.460
Stop being such a dumb boy
or you're going to
blow it with her.

17:51.460 --> 17:53.420
She's a really great person.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.500
Better than you deserve.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.500
Keep doing what you're doing
and you'll lose her.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.380
I can't believe
you're giving me
advice about Andi.

18:03.790 --> 18:06.170
She's pretending to be
the cool girl.

18:06.170 --> 18:08.250
But she's not the cool girl.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.460
She's jealous.

18:10.460 --> 18:13.420
And she's not gonna
tell you that, so I have to.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.960
And by the way,

18:15.960 --> 18:20.120
you dated the cool girl
and you couldn't handle
the cool girl.

18:25.210 --> 18:28.880
(doo-wop music plays)

18:31.790 --> 18:33.710
So Jonah's not coming?

18:35.540 --> 18:37.000
Why not?

18:37.000 --> 18:40.920
Because he wants to be
in some Ultimate Disc video...

18:40.920 --> 18:42.880
with Natalie.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.620
Don't feel bad.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.120
Do we even know
if he can sing?

18:46.120 --> 18:47.620
That's not the point.

18:47.620 --> 18:50.120
The point is, he already
had plans with Andi.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.670
But it's okay,

18:51.670 --> 18:54.080
because what are the chances
he even knows the lyrics?

18:54.080 --> 18:56.040
I'm gonna say remote.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.670
I just could tell
that he really, really
wanted to do the video.

18:59.670 --> 19:02.620
Even after you told him
you wanted him to do this?

19:03.830 --> 19:06.170
You did tell him that, right?

19:06.170 --> 19:09.670
Not in so many words.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.170
How many words?

19:11.170 --> 19:12.750
Zero words.

19:12.750 --> 19:15.830
But it wouldn't have made
any difference anyways.

19:15.830 --> 19:18.000
Well, I guess
we'll never know that.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.540
Will we?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.460
I need to know.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.380
I need to know.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.120
You could have just
let it go.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.000
Let it go?

19:36.000 --> 19:39.540

22:02.880 --> 22:04.670
in all it's glory!

22:04.670 --> 22:05.960
Let's just call it a draw.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.120
Driscoll doesn't draw.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.080
Today is your birthday.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.120
It is?

22:11.120 --> 22:14.290
We're throwing him
a surprise party!

22:14.290 --> 22:15.670
I don't buy that this is

22:15.670 --> 22:18.540
all because you hate
the idea of birthdays.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.830
I just hate
the idea of mine.

22:21.830 --> 22:23.580
Guests:
Surprise!
