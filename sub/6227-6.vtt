WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.159
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.503 --> 00:04.471
He's gonna announce that he's
running for Mayor of Portland.

00:04.755 --> 00:06.302
Well, nobody gets elected
without confidence

00:06.423 --> 00:07.720
or the right people
backing him.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.223
It's Trubel. I'm taking
her to a hospital.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.599
I need to
know if she's alive.

00:11.803 --> 00:13.146
Who is this?
Adalind?

00:13.222 --> 00:14.269
Meisner?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.428
- Is that her motorcycle?
- She might've stolen it.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.687
And she's wearing body armor,
carrying three false identifications

00:19.770 --> 00:21.772
and a lot of cash. This has got
to be connected to Chavez.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.027
It's four.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.783
You need to tell me
where she is.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.405
If you won't,
you need to go to her.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.286
- They'll find her.
- I got her.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.702
Get her out.
I'll get the other one.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.500
They're gonna take me.
Not anymore.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.213
You're with me.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.807
Remember, midnight.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.222
Not before.

00:51.927 --> 00:53.304
Only these addresses.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.273
What if someone
gets in our way?

00:56.431 --> 00:57.551
You get them
out of your way.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.605
What if
somebody's inside?

01:04.480 --> 01:06.028
That's their crappy luck.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.865
Sorry, I hope I didn't
wake you up.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.948
No, I was sort of up.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.872
I got you...

01:55.699 --> 01:57.918
Don't worry. Not a lot
of privacy around here.

02:00.954 --> 02:05.209
Oh, you probably don't even know
that I had the baby, do you?

02:06.084 --> 02:09.003
I mean, how could you know? It's not
as if I sent out birth announcements.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.423
We named him
Kelly after...

02:10.505 --> 02:11.882
Nick's mom.
Yeah.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.518
I'm really glad
you're okay.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.563
I mean, we're really glad.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.188
Nick was a little out of his
mind when he couldn't find you.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.896
How long have I been here?

02:26.563 --> 02:28.816
Nick brought you home
from the hospital last night.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.242
Last night?

02:31.318 --> 02:33.491
You've been asleep
for about 25 hours.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.332
Oh, my God.
What am I wearing?

02:37.908 --> 02:39.125
Nick's shirt.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.377
He brought your clothes back.
I washed them.

02:42.537 --> 02:45.541
I'll take over for Nick
so you guys can talk.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.821
Yeah, still...

03:07.896 --> 03:10.115
Getting the hang of that
changing-the-diaper thing.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.402
How are you feeling?
Sore.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.912
And really glad
to see you.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.955
Was somebody in
the hospital Wesen?

03:21.785 --> 03:23.287
Yeah, I'll tell you
about that later.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.382
Still have some questions myself,
but you've got to be hungry.

03:27.708 --> 03:31.053
A little, yeah.
Well, no, a lot.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.959
What are you doing?
That's my store.

04:41.490 --> 04:44.869
Let me go! Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!

05:25.575 --> 05:26.747
They know, Nick.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.212
Ever since Chavez found
out you were a Grimm.

05:29.788 --> 05:30.789
I didn't tell her.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.424
How did you find me?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.177
Well, they've been
keeping track of you

05:35.252 --> 05:36.572
'cause that's
where they found me.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.505
They didn't know what you
knew or didn't know.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.432
And this is the group
you were telling me about?

05:40.590 --> 05:42.263
They want people
like us on their side.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.806
People with our abilities.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.886
You're working for them?

05:45.929 --> 05:48.273
Well, when I left here
and went to take Josh home,

05:49.140 --> 05:51.438
they found me there
or followed me there.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.145
Who are they?
HW...

05:55.313 --> 05:57.156
Hadrian's Wall,
or something.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.281
That's what they
call themselves.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.367
All I know is they're
a part of the government,

06:02.946 --> 06:04.038
but a part so secret

06:04.281 --> 06:06.521
that most of the government
doesn't even know they exist.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.341
I guess they don't trust a lot of
people in the government either.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.918
But they're fighting this underground war.
Against who?

06:13.582 --> 06:14.583
Wesen.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.799
Nobody knows how many there
are or how big a group it is,

06:18.920 --> 06:21.139
but it's all over,
not just in this country,

06:21.214 --> 06:23.342
it's everywhere,
like a revolution.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.724
I had to help.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.933
Nick, HW needs
Grimms on their side,

06:32.142 --> 06:34.065
and I'm not the only one
fighting for them.

06:34.978 --> 06:38.232
I worked with one in Lisbon, and I
heard about another in Bangkok.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.695
You went to Lisbon?

06:41.192 --> 06:42.193
Twice.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.954
I never know where I'm going
or what I'm supposed to do

06:45.030 --> 06:46.828
until I have
to do it, but...

06:48.199 --> 06:50.543
I mean, there are sections
of HW all over the world.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.541
Do they
pay you for this?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.165
Actually, yeah,
they do.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.922
In cash.
Do you know Meisner?

07:02.047 --> 07:03.924
Yeah, I do.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.147
I told him, he was
gonna have to meet you.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.601
Already has.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.318
When I was getting
you out of the hospital.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.392
And Meisner was there?

07:14.184 --> 07:15.982
If he wasn't there,
you might not be here.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.034
What did they do
with Juliette's body?

07:26.738 --> 07:28.115
I don't know.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.385
Well, why did they
take you that night?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.127
Because they knew
I was with you.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.455
It all happened so fast.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.546
I wanted to tell you, but they wouldn't
let me, and then I got sent away.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.668
To do what?

07:40.335 --> 07:41.507
What Grimms do.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.049
How long have they
been watching Nick?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.060
Ever since I killed
Weston Steward,

07:49.260 --> 07:51.388
and Chavez found Nick's
Grimm book on my bed.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.733
They've been
watching you too.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.726
Me? Why?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.437
'Cause you're a Hexenbiest.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.155
Was.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.482
Yeah, they know
about that too.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.359
And about your baby.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.324
They wouldn't.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.948
No, they don't
want your kid.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.585
Tell me about
that motorcycle.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.669
It's mine.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.165
You want to show me?

08:19.874 --> 08:21.046
Sure.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.509
So, they gave it to me, like,

08:25.588 --> 08:27.090
six months after I started.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.179
It's not normal.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.265
It does all kinds of things.
Like what?

08:31.553 --> 08:32.679
Okay.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.222
You lift this.
Yeah.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.727
I already did that.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.559
Oh.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.270
I got more.
This leaves an oil slick.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.777
This blows out smoke
big time,

08:43.857 --> 08:44.858
but you breathe it,

08:44.941 --> 08:46.488
and it knocks you down.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.287
Over here is your
Internet connection.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.872
Your satellite
tracking system,

08:50.947 --> 08:54.121
I mean, it can find any phone
number any time anywhere.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.877
It's how I found you.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.563
God, why do I always
do this with you?

09:05.712 --> 09:06.713
Um...

09:07.797 --> 09:09.470
I just thought
I'd never see you again.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.636
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.563
Oh, God.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.229
Still hurts a little bit.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.155
I can't believe
you're a dad too.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.453
I can't believe
that either.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.575
I mean...

09:33.323 --> 09:34.449
It's Hank.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.658
Oh. Tell him I said hi.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.082
Hey.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.754
- We got a big one.
- How big?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.377
Don't know.
Lot of places hit.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.776
All right,
where am I meeting you?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.258
Where the body is.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.256
North Denver and Kilpatrick.

09:46.628 --> 09:47.675
How's Trubel?

09:47.754 --> 09:48.801
She's awake.
She says hi.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.474
I'll tell you more
about it when I get there.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.352
You okay here?
Yeah.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.096
I'll tell Adalind.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.269
Looks like
a gang-related rampage.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.440
Happened around midnight.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.769
This is not the only
street that was hit.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.971
It's all over the city.
Three different neighborhoods.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.402
Reports coming in are similar
to what we got here.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.653
Shops were hit,

10:07.732 --> 10:09.450
car windows broken,
general mayhem.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.780
So far, we've got one
shop owner murdered,

10:12.862 --> 10:13.863
another badly beaten,

10:13.947 --> 10:15.199
third one is missing,

10:15.281 --> 10:17.534
Name of Xavier Arivaca,
owns the bakery.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.211
Some shops
were untouched?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.547
Yep. Pretty random.

10:23.665 --> 10:24.791
This was Ken Honeycutt.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.044
Had the flower shop
across the street.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.345
Doesn't look
gang-related to me.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.928
Any idea why some
shops were targeted

10:33.007 --> 10:34.087
and others were left alone?

10:34.217 --> 10:37.061
Nope, not according to the
shop owners we talked to,

10:37.637 --> 10:39.105
but I've got
my own theory.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.225
In the bakery.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.488
We have not found this mark

10:51.568 --> 10:53.070
anywhere else tonight.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.411
Look familiar?

10:59.242 --> 11:00.334
Yeah.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.378
What do we know
about our missing baker?

11:02.453 --> 11:04.126
Opened the bakery
three years ago

11:04.205 --> 11:05.885
when he moved to Portland.
No local family.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.417
That's all I've been able
to put together so far.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.501
We need to find out

11:08.585 --> 11:09.837
if any of the shop owners
are Wesen.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.296
Killing's definitely Wesen.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.380
Yep.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.925
- Now we go to Brenda Braxton...
- You got to hear this.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.011
What
happened last night.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.563
Brenda.
Last night, several streets

11:20.638 --> 11:22.185
in the Portland area
were vandalized

11:22.265 --> 11:25.144
in a spree of
gang-related violence.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.649
One shop owner,
Ken Honeycutt,

11:27.729 --> 11:29.197
was brutally
beaten to death...

11:29.272 --> 11:30.444
Oh, my God.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.615
...down the street
from Ken's Flowers,

11:31.691 --> 11:33.693
a shop he's owned
for nine years.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.280
And three doors down
from Ken's Flowers,

11:36.362 --> 11:38.706
the owner of
Xavier's Artisan bakery...

11:38.781 --> 11:39.782
Xavier.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.914
Xavier Arivaca,
was dragged from his shop,

11:41.993 --> 11:43.040
and is currently missing.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.046
Somebody took Xavier?

11:45.455 --> 11:47.924
They kill a guy on the street,
smash a bunch of shops,

11:47.999 --> 11:49.922
and kidnap Xavier?
What the hell is going on?

11:56.925 --> 11:58.142
Ah, thank God
you're home.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.765
I was on my way to work
when I heard it on the news.

11:59.844 --> 12:00.845
I couldn't believe it.

12:01.596 --> 12:04.975
I drove right past
my shop and came right here.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.189
You've got it on.
You got it on,

12:07.268 --> 12:08.269
just what I'm talking about.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.696
Reports of similar incidents

12:09.771 --> 12:11.523
as far away
as Eugene and Seattle.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.117
This is unbelievable.
Eugene and Seattle?

12:14.192 --> 12:16.069
You know, they killed
Ken Honeycutt.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.904
I went to high school
with his brother.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.864
This is crazy
what's happening.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.083
You know, they kidnapped a guy too.
Yeah, we know. Xavier.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.159
He's a friend.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.258
How could somebody
do something like that?

12:25.370 --> 12:26.792
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.790
I mean, a really
bad feeling.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.668
I mean, a feeling so bad that
it's got to mean something.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.840
Something bad.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.548
No! Please!

12:37.006 --> 12:40.010
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.762
I didn't do anything to you!

12:41.844 --> 12:42.970
I didn't do anything!

12:43.846 --> 12:45.519
I don't want to die!
Shut up!

12:51.896 --> 12:53.193
You know who this is?

12:55.566 --> 12:57.068
No, no, I don't.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.362
Take another look.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.672
You don't want
to lie to me.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.598
Witness reports
are consistent.

13:19.882 --> 13:23.182
All describe the same kind of
vandalism, presumably gang-related.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.223
What's unusual is they were
all wearing black shirts.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.559
Never heard of that
as a gang uniform.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.654
And the vandalism was
crossing gang boundaries.

13:32.729 --> 13:33.981
That doesn't make any sense.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.588
Same kind of thing happened last
night in Eugene and Seattle.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.985
Why would these gangs be working
together all of a sudden?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.748
Somebody's got to be
pulling them together.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.746
These guys
hate each other.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.173
Maybe it's got
something to do with this.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.628
Now, Trubel told me
that Chavez's group

13:53.082 --> 13:54.959
is fighting some
kind of Wesen uprising.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.802
"Wesen uprising"?

13:58.212 --> 13:59.680
That doesn't
sound good.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.072
Check with the other
business owners.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.212
See if they know anything
about the marks on the wall.

14:06.637 --> 14:07.638
Rosalee.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.770
Nick, I hate to bother you,
but do you know anything

14:09.849 --> 14:11.396
about all this
vandalism last night?

14:11.601 --> 14:14.362
No, we're just starting the investigation
now. Why? You know anything?

14:14.395 --> 14:15.863
Yeah, we know some of the
people that were hit.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.235
We know the guy
who's missing, and...

14:17.315 --> 14:18.675
And I know
the guy that was killed.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.527
- Bud?
- Yeah, I'm here.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.202
Uh, I'm ready if you need me.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.197
Don't know what you might
need me for, but I'm there.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.203
Nick, all the victims
we know were Wesen.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.642
Ken was one of the nicest Eisbibers
you'd ever want to know.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.930
I went to high school
with his brother.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.417
We found another one
of those marks

14:32.497 --> 14:33.874
on the wall inside
Xavier's bakery.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.046
Oh, God. "Marks"? Marks?
What marks?

14:36.125 --> 14:37.672
This isn't
a Wolfsangel thing...

14:37.752 --> 14:38.799
Bud... Shh.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.380
Where are you?
We're at...

14:40.463 --> 14:41.783
I'm at Monroe and
Rosalee's house.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.591
We're on our way.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.939
Kelly's finally asleep.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.769
How's it going?
Okay.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.200
Look, I don't know
that much about you,

15:01.275 --> 15:04.996
and whatever you know about
me probably isn't that good,

15:06.489 --> 15:08.617
so now that we're
living together,

15:08.699 --> 15:11.373
I thought maybe we should get to
know one another a little better.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.169
Oh. I know you tried
to help Juliette,

15:16.582 --> 15:18.801
and I know you slept with
Nick, which is, I guess,

15:19.377 --> 15:20.503
why you're here.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.047
Ah...

15:28.386 --> 15:29.854
What do you
think about Nick?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.393
What do you mean?

15:32.515 --> 15:34.358
Are you, like,
in love with him?

15:38.521 --> 15:40.068
No, no. That would...

15:40.356 --> 15:44.281
That would just be too, I mean,
that would be really too...

15:44.861 --> 15:46.488
I just...

15:47.196 --> 15:48.823
I don't even know
what that would be.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.034
'Cause you guys
are living together

15:52.118 --> 15:54.496
and sharing
the same room.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.664
No, that's just
'cause I get scared.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.511
We're not sleeping together, we're
just sleeping next to each other.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.052
Uh-huh.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.764
So, I guess you know Meisner.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.387
Yeah, I do.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.842
If it wasn't for him,
I probably wouldn't be alive.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.055
Did he tell you
anything about me?

16:13.014 --> 16:14.891
He didn't, no.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.065
He was with me when
I gave birth to Diana.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.358
Losing her is the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.366
I never got a chance to thank you
for trying to get her back.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.459
I think
she's gonna be okay.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.549
You don't know
the Royals like I do.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.183
So, this organization
you work for,

16:49.258 --> 16:50.931
did they want you
to kill Juliette?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.729
When you left Bud's,
I figured you were probably

16:53.804 --> 16:55.351
going back
to Nick's place.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.059
You went back for her,
didn't you?

17:03.272 --> 17:04.615
Yeah, I did.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.701
But Nick doesn't know that.

17:11.781 --> 17:12.998
I'm not gonna tell him.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.123
But you probably should,
at some point.

17:19.579 --> 17:20.832
Looks like he's getting up.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.584
That was an unfortunately
short nap.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.514
This is unbelievable, a thing
like this happening in Portland.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.471
Well, not just here. Half
a dozen cities were hit.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.437
Why would they kidnap Xavier?
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.524
Well, he actually
would hurt a fly.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.854
I mean, he's
a hasenfussige Schnecke.

17:43.938 --> 17:46.258
They think of flies as a kind
of delicacy, but point taken.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.152
It's not a Woge you forget.
God knows you want to.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.078
Look, every time
we've seen this mark,

17:51.153 --> 17:52.154
it's involved a Wesen.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.458
And two of the people who were
attacked we know are Wesen.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.625
Judging by the way
Ken the florist was killed,

17:57.660 --> 17:59.333
these gang guys
could be Wesen too.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.706
Oh, my God.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.750
Look what those
bastards did to Ken.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.752
So why are Wesen
attacking Wesen?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.966
And why are they all
wearing black shirts?

18:08.170 --> 18:09.763
A coordinated effort,
that's for sure.

18:12.675 --> 18:13.892
What?

18:13.968 --> 18:15.094
It means,
"Free the hidden."

18:16.012 --> 18:17.389
Who's hidden?

18:17.471 --> 18:18.831
The Wesen that
are using that mark.

18:18.973 --> 18:19.974
A kind of warning.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.320
Huh. Kind of looks like
a claw mark, I think.

18:26.981 --> 18:29.501
So, did you talk with the other
shop owners about what happened?

18:29.609 --> 18:30.701
No.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.285
Nobody seems to be
talking to anybody.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.824
We're too busy
cleaning up.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.163
Just one more question.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.504
You ever seen this before?

18:43.706 --> 18:44.798
No.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.427
You know,
it was inside the bakery.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.717
I don't know
anything about it.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.316
Look, I got to get
back to cleaning up.

18:55.051 --> 18:58.305
It's gonna be hard for us to
help you if you won't help us.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.591
Whoa!

19:38.761 --> 19:40.013
Help me.

19:41.806 --> 19:42.932
Help me, please.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.104
Hello, I'm Sean Renard.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.115
I spent the last 20 years
in law enforcement.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.110
Now, I've never endorsed
a political candidate before

19:54.193 --> 19:56.241
but this election,
I'm making an exception

19:56.320 --> 19:59.324
because we have an exceptional
candidate running for mayor.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.788
His name is Andrew Dixon.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.503
I know him to be
honest, hardworking,

20:04.787 --> 20:07.290
and as concerned
about this city as I am.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.376
Go to his website, learn more
about what he stands for.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.962
I hope you vote
in this election,

20:13.045 --> 20:15.139
and I urge you to vote
for Andrew Dixon.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.803
And that's a cut.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.997
How was that?
Was that all right?

20:19.009 --> 20:20.249
It was great.
Just what we need.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.120
You don't need me
to do another one?

20:22.346 --> 20:23.438
Actually, I do.

20:23.514 --> 20:24.731
Huh. Okay.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.855
How did I screw up?
You didn't.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.561
But it would be great
if we could get one

20:28.644 --> 20:30.191
a little less "police captain",

20:30.271 --> 20:32.319
and a little more "neighbor".

20:32.898 --> 20:35.058
It's not what you're saying,
it's how you're saying it.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.028
Just be more relaxed.

20:38.529 --> 20:39.655
How about I take
my gun off?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.581
Yeah, like that.
Have fun with it.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.323
All right, we're going again.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.948
Can we get the little shine
off his forehead? Thank you.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.004
A lot of street violence
is not happenstance.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.341
I mean, some of it is, of
course, but just so you know,

21:00.176 --> 21:03.601
the majority of street
riots are instigated by Wesen.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.999
It's not something
we're proud of,

21:05.014 --> 21:08.054
and certainly not something the history
books will tell you, but there it is.

21:08.601 --> 21:12.447
Here's a good example.
Réveillon riots. Paris, 1789.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.324
That's a good one, everyone
thinks this started because

21:15.399 --> 21:17.367
one factory was unionized
and the others weren't.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.866
But actually it was
Wesen factory owners

21:19.945 --> 21:22.789
going up against this guy,
Réveillon, who was not Wesen.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.742
Réveillon was Kehrseite,
and they looked down on him.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.185
And here's
the crazy irony, though.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.128
A lot of his workers
were Wesen,

21:28.204 --> 21:29.684
and they were loyal
to him because he,

21:29.747 --> 21:31.169
you know, treated them well.

21:31.332 --> 21:32.879
The Wesen who
worked for Réveillon

21:32.958 --> 21:34.518
were targeted and killed
in these riots.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.150
Right, so on the surface,
looked like a union problem,

21:37.213 --> 21:39.466
but the truth is,
it was a Wesen problem.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.050
Similar to what
happened last night.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.305
Right, and this
isn't the only example.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.933
I mean, the Boxer Rebellion, draft
riots during the Civil War.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.826
I mean, the freaking
Boston Tea Party.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.228
- All started by Wesen?
Mmm-hmm.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.729
No wonder history
seems to repeat itself.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.436
Nobody really
knows the history.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.274
And bottom line,
don't rile us up.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.815
- Well, most of us.
- So...

21:56.565 --> 21:58.158
Last night was
Wesen on Wesen.

21:58.275 --> 22:01.575
Feels like some of us are
being made an example of.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.414
Now, your friend who was kidnapped,
was he involved in any groups?

22:04.698 --> 22:06.666
I doubt it.
That bakery was his life.

22:06.742 --> 22:07.743
That's the weird thing.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.625
Xavier was all
about the bread.

22:09.703 --> 22:10.795
That's Ken exactly.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.311
He doesn't like groups.
He never did.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.632
Wu, I'm putting
you on speaker.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.253
You got anything?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.758
Yep, I got something.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.340
Xavier.
He's alive?

22:21.757 --> 22:23.930
He's pretty beat up,
but he managed to get away.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.529
We got him under guard
at the hospital.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.221
He's had the crap
scared out of him.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.430
Which hospital?

22:28.806 --> 22:30.206
St. Joe's.
All right, meet us there.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.109
Bring the mug shots.
Xavier's alive.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.857
He was luckier than Ken.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.529
They had me
blindfolded most of the time.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.778
I never really got
a good look at them.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.951
The only thing I know is
they all wore black shirts.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.030
Do you know
where they took you?

22:44.113 --> 22:46.536
Some old warehouse,
but it was dark.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.369
And when I got free
I just ran and ran

22:50.452 --> 22:52.125
until I saw
the St. John's bridge.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.626
How did you get away?

22:53.706 --> 22:54.832
It was horrible.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.297
The guy watching me
fell asleep.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.428
I heard him snoring,
and took off my hood.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.969
It was just the two of us.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.388
I picked up
a brick and...

23:06.218 --> 23:08.516
Hit him in the head
more than once.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.724
I don't know how many times.
There was a lot of blood.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.102
Then I took the keys,
unlocked the door, and...

23:15.477 --> 23:18.105
Just ran until I
couldn't run anymore.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.451
Do you recognize
this mark?

23:26.906 --> 23:27.998
No.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.493
Is that my bakery?
They do that?

23:30.743 --> 23:31.744
We think so.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.293
Do you think you could
recognize your captors?

23:35.372 --> 23:36.624
No.

23:38.626 --> 23:39.843
I can't, they'll kill me.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.172
Xavier...

23:43.756 --> 23:46.009
We know that they attacked
you because you're Wesen.

23:56.810 --> 23:57.902
No.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.242
I've heard about you.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.783
We can protect you.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.454
But we need you to
identify anyone you can.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.290
What do I have to do?

24:17.373 --> 24:19.592
Just look at
some photographs.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.759
There's no hurry.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.843
Look at each one carefully. If you
see anyone familiar, just tell us.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.641
No.

24:32.346 --> 24:33.723
Do you recognize anyone?

24:42.731 --> 24:44.074
Not on this page.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.465
I'm sorry,
maybe I shouldn't do this.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.078
Maybe I just can't remember.

24:48.737 --> 24:49.863
Just take your time.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.131
I can't be sure, but...

25:07.589 --> 25:09.091
She might've been
one of them.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.119
We've been able to identify
two of the victims as Wesen.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.955
Because of the claw mark tag,
we think the people involved

25:32.031 --> 25:33.157
in the attack
are Wesen too.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.034
Isn't this the same tag
used by Wemlinger

25:35.117 --> 25:36.334
when he killed
those two marshals?

25:36.410 --> 25:38.037
It is.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.669
And I've seen it
once before.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.712
Crime scene?

25:45.002 --> 25:47.972
Well... Sort of.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.266
I had a meeting with Chavez.

25:55.846 --> 25:56.938
When?

25:57.806 --> 25:58.898
The night she was killed.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.398
What do you mean,
Chavez was killed?

26:02.478 --> 26:03.478
It was a set-up.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.817
They attacked us
right when we got there.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.977
You know the FBI is still
looking for her, don't you?

26:11.153 --> 26:12.655
You didn't...
No.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.665
No, I tried to save her,
and I might have,

26:15.741 --> 26:17.414
but I was too busy
fighting a Gelumcaedus.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.417
Look, they were all Wesen.
So was Chavez.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.923
We're still trying to figure
out what we're dealing with.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.000
You knew about this?
Yeah.

26:27.211 --> 26:30.215
Then for both your sakes, I
suggest the FBI never find out.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.889
But the last thing Chavez
said before she died was,

26:36.095 --> 26:38.393
"They're coming
to Portland. It's war."

26:38.889 --> 26:40.436
You think the same people
who killed Chavez

26:40.516 --> 26:41.893
could've instigated
what happened last night?

26:41.975 --> 26:43.192
That's what
it looks like.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.379
And Billie Trump might be
our best chance to get them.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.449
Bring her in.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.619
Put her in a lineup. Make
sure Xavier identifies her.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.786
I want to talk to a lawyer.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.862
You don't
need a lawyer

26:54.905 --> 26:56.202
unless you get
identified in the lineup.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.246
Then you'll need a lawyer.
This is such crap.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.747
Only if you're innocent.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.170
I'm not doing
any stupid lineup.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.457
Uh...

27:06.166 --> 27:07.213
I'm not sure.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.339
Just relax.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.304
I just don't know.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.390
I think you do.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.436
Don't be scared. She can't see
you, and we're right here.

27:22.808 --> 27:23.809
No.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.236
No, I'm not sure.
I'm not... Not sure.

27:26.895 --> 27:27.896
That's not her.

27:32.526 --> 27:33.903
I can't do this.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.314
You're gonna
have to let her go.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.836
We can't let her go.
She'll disappear.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.788
And if she's a part of this group,
we'll never find her again.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.335
You have any other
evidence connecting her

27:46.415 --> 27:47.775
to the kidnapping
or what happened?

27:47.833 --> 27:48.834
Not yet.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.169
You want to try
getting to her directly?

27:50.252 --> 27:51.378
Look, she won't talk.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.713
She already
asked for a lawyer.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.013
I mean, what if she's
not the right one?

27:54.089 --> 27:55.841
No, she's the right one. The
witness is just too scared.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.141
Well, then
get him unscared.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.682
Everybody that was hit,
every single one is Wesen.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.438
Every one of us
knows one of them.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.861
The shops that weren't hit,
weren't owned by Wesen.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.689
It's obvious,
they are targeting us.

28:10.772 --> 28:11.864
Yeah, but why?

28:11.940 --> 28:13.317
I mean, we don't
even know who they are.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.947
Well, I heard
they were Wesen.

28:15.235 --> 28:18.865
Pete Walton said that he saw one
Woge, and it was a Skalengeck.

28:19.072 --> 28:22.542
Wesen attacking Wesen
is not right!

28:22.618 --> 28:24.620
Calm down, everybody.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.331
Please! We don't know
anything for sure yet.

28:27.414 --> 28:28.882
Nick is investigating
the murder.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.397
What about the sign
in Xavier's shop?

28:30.459 --> 28:32.132
Has he found out
anything about that yet?

28:32.586 --> 28:33.586
Bud.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.256
I'm gonna get the phone.
You deal with them.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.386
No, I'm happy to
get the phone...

28:36.465 --> 28:37.808
No, honey, I'm good.
I'm good.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.311
Spice and Tea. Nick.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.180
Things are getting
crazy around here.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.983
There's a lot of fear
about what's going on.

28:45.182 --> 28:47.150
Everybody's coming here looking
for some kind of answer.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.728
We don't know what to tell them.
I need your help.

28:48.810 --> 28:49.857
You and Monroe.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.277
Xavier is too
scared to identify

28:52.356 --> 28:53.573
one of the people
who kidnapped him.

28:53.649 --> 28:56.744
Now, we have to cut her loose unless
we can convince him to ID her.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.367
You and Monroe are friends of his.
I need you to come down here,

28:59.446 --> 29:01.494
talk to him, see if he
can do the right thing.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.329
Okay, we'll be there
as soon as we can.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.185
You just need to
identify her.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.374
I want to go home.
No.

29:12.668 --> 29:13.760
Now, I need you
to think about what

29:13.835 --> 29:14.835
you're gonna do here.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.882
No, I got to deal with the insurance.
My bakery's destroyed.

29:17.965 --> 29:19.342
If you don't
identify her...

29:20.425 --> 29:22.018
I've thought about it.

29:22.552 --> 29:23.804
I can't.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.936
Rosalee, Monroe,
what are you doing here?

29:30.018 --> 29:31.486
Oh, we're so glad
you're all right.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.029
It's terrible
what they did to you.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.149
Nick, talk to you
out here?

29:35.941 --> 29:38.615
Why are you guys here?
Did you get hit too?

29:39.319 --> 29:40.696
No.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.080
We came to
talk to you.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.870
Burkhardt is
a friend of ours.

29:45.367 --> 29:47.040
You know he's a Grimm?
Yes.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.207
I helped him
through all that

29:48.287 --> 29:49.288
when he first
found out.

29:49.371 --> 29:50.998
He's a good guy.
You can trust him.

29:52.499 --> 29:53.625
Okay. Fine.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.583
They want me to pick out the
woman who kidnapped me.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.222
Is she the one?

30:01.591 --> 30:03.191
I can't tell them
that she's one of them.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.472
She'll know I did,
and they'll kill me.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.556
Xavier.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.310
You can't let them
get away with this.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.482
They kidnapped you, man.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.109
What's to keep them from
coming after you again?

30:16.231 --> 30:18.529
You weren't the only one.
They went after a lot of us.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.201
Yeah, they killed
Ken Honeycutt.

30:21.111 --> 30:22.363
What? They killed Ken?

30:22.446 --> 30:24.448
We cannot let them
get away with this.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.825
Nick will protect you.

30:26.742 --> 30:27.868
A Grimm will protect us?

30:27.951 --> 30:29.077
I told you.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.583
You can trust him.

30:31.413 --> 30:32.585
With my life?

30:32.664 --> 30:33.756
Yes. We have.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.084
Many times.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.552
I just...

30:37.919 --> 30:39.921
I don't know.
It's all so...

30:41.214 --> 30:42.340
So...

30:42.424 --> 30:43.516
No, please.
You don't have to do that.

30:43.592 --> 30:44.889
Really, we're good.
It's okay.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.943
You guys really
trust him that much?

30:53.477 --> 30:55.275
You think we'd be
here if we didn't?

30:59.441 --> 31:00.613
All right.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.612
I'll do it.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.617
Put her in custody.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.540
Use her to
get to the others.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.961
Want to tell us
about the black shirts?

31:12.120 --> 31:13.713
We found one
in your home.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.639
Making some
kind of statement?

31:25.217 --> 31:26.639
Do you know
anything about this?

31:29.971 --> 31:31.223
Are you bored yet?

31:33.100 --> 31:34.226
Billie...

31:34.518 --> 31:36.361
You have been
positively identified

31:36.436 --> 31:38.234
in the kidnapping
of Xavier Arivaca.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.816
You're looking at
federal and state charges,

31:41.650 --> 31:44.153
not to mention acts of
terrorism and murder.

31:46.321 --> 31:47.538
Where's my lawyer?

31:47.614 --> 31:49.294
You're not getting
out of this one, Billie.

31:49.825 --> 31:50.825
Not with the victim

31:50.867 --> 31:52.084
pointing you out
in the courtroom.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.833
You're looking at
a minimum of 20 years.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.165
And when the
other charges stick,

31:56.248 --> 31:57.768
you're going away
for a very long time.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.841
Unless you make
a deal with us.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.517
Now, we don't think you were calling
the shots, but you know who does.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.179
You got something we need,

32:10.846 --> 32:12.314
we got something you need.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.187
If we walk out of here,
there is no deal.

32:15.517 --> 32:16.957
We're gonna
find out whoever did this

32:17.018 --> 32:18.110
with or without you.

32:20.730 --> 32:21.947
I got nothing to say.

32:23.733 --> 32:24.825
Billie, I know
what's going on here.

32:24.901 --> 32:25.948
I know you're Wesen

32:26.027 --> 32:27.529
and I know your
friends are Wesen.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.450
So I guess you're
both Wesen too, right?

32:32.576 --> 32:34.704
You think that makes us family?
No.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.547
Well, I don't either.
You're a cop.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.669
I'm a cop.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.593
He's a Grimm.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.388
You gonna kill me?
'Cause I'll start screaming.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.812
If I was gonna kill you,

32:56.892 --> 32:57.892
it wouldn't be in here.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.151
And we wouldn't be talking.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.317
Now...

33:01.396 --> 33:02.989
We know this is
Wesen-related.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.738
We either do this
in the justice system...

33:08.904 --> 33:10.121
Give us a name.

33:11.615 --> 33:12.912
What happens to me?

33:15.577 --> 33:18.251
We can get you probation
and witness protection.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.550
One name, Billie.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.799
Who's running this?

33:27.881 --> 33:29.303
Just give us a name.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.682
Dallas Cruz.

33:37.432 --> 33:38.433
Dallas?

33:38.725 --> 33:40.693
Billie, where the hell are you?
I'm out.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.980
They put me in a lineup,
but they let me go.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.691
Anybody follow you?

33:45.774 --> 33:47.026
No, no. I'm good.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.573
It freaked me out.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.163
I need to get out of town.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.799
Don't say
any more on the phone.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.326
Meet me at the factory.

33:58.912 --> 34:00.914
Didn't get it.
What's the factory?

34:01.790 --> 34:02.962
It's a place we meet.

34:04.668 --> 34:05.715
Draw it.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.297
Why? 'Cause you're
taking us there.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.306
No.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.592
You can't
make me do that.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.428
They can't make me do that.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.889
Yeah, they can.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.161
Where is it?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.246
Off North Lombard.

34:37.324 --> 34:38.746
That's the old substation.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.380
I don't know what it was.
Where do you meet?

34:46.668 --> 34:49.045
This building right here.
We call it "the factory".

34:49.129 --> 34:50.130
And where are the doors?

34:54.676 --> 34:56.599
There's one in the front,
one in the back,

34:56.678 --> 34:59.181
and there's an old
loading dock right here.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.265
Any windows?

35:01.099 --> 35:02.442
Only ones up high.

35:02.517 --> 35:03.837
Will he see you
when you drive up?

35:05.353 --> 35:08.106
Not if I park here. It's the
backside of the building.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.203
Let's go. You're going
outside the wire.

35:29.419 --> 35:32.389
I don't know the woman,
but I do know Dallas Cruz.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.967
He's a nasty Skalengeck.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.726
How do you know him?

35:37.010 --> 35:38.432
He had a run-in with
a couple of friends

35:38.511 --> 35:39.888
of mine maybe nine,
ten years ago.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.315
My friends set him off,
and he nearly killed them.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.484
This guy enjoys
hurting people.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.159
I was kind of hoping
he'd be dead by now.

35:46.436 --> 35:47.562
Well, we know where he is.

35:47.646 --> 35:48.846
And we're gonna
bring him down.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.282
I want to go too.
Monroe...

35:51.358 --> 35:53.486
Look, if this guy's
part of a group

35:53.568 --> 35:54.694
that's coming after Wesen,

35:55.487 --> 35:57.114
how long before
we're on that list?

36:00.241 --> 36:01.881
What about Xavier?
Are you taking him too?

36:02.077 --> 36:03.329
No, just Billie.

36:03.411 --> 36:04.931
We'll have an officer
take Xavier home.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.251
Why don't I do that?

36:08.249 --> 36:09.717
He's pretty shook up.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.508
And we're the ones that
convinced him to do this.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.137
I'll go tell him.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.186
Hank and Nick, you guys are
gonna ride in Billie's car.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.763
Monroe, you ride with me.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.899
You all right, Xavier?
Yeah.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.948
I just keep reliving it
over and over again.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.075
I thought they
were gonna kill me.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.828
I'm so sorry you had
to go through this.

36:37.487 --> 36:38.955
I wouldn't wish it
on anybody.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.344
Well, I might wish it
on a few people.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.461
Thank God you're okay.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.091
That's Dallas's
truck over there.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.570
You got to walk
the rest of the way.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.215
You're not
staying in the car.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.390
What?

36:59.008 --> 37:00.851
If he sees me with you,
he's gonna kill me.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.527
Well, that's a chance
we'll have to take.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.480
Ready?
Yeah.

37:07.517 --> 37:10.396
That was a really brave thing you
did, identifying that woman.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.319
Did they tell you
why they took you?

37:13.982 --> 37:15.074
I don't know.

37:15.316 --> 37:16.909
They just
kept me blindfolded

37:16.985 --> 37:18.157
and tied up
the whole time.

37:18.778 --> 37:19.825
How did you escape?

37:20.613 --> 37:22.411
Can we not talk
about this, please?

37:22.824 --> 37:24.201
I'm sorry.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.154
Don't worry,
they'll get Cruz,

37:27.203 --> 37:28.796
and then they'll get
the rest of them.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.915
You don't know what
these people are like.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.093
I've dealt with a few.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.716
They're crazy,
what they're gonna do.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.130
They told you?

37:38.506 --> 37:40.349
No, no. Forget it.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.394
I thought you said
they didn't talk to you.

37:43.470 --> 37:44.471
They didn't.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.356
Then how do you know
what they're gonna do?

37:57.025 --> 37:58.527
Xavier, what's wrong?

37:59.986 --> 38:01.078
Tell me.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.701
What's wrong?

38:04.032 --> 38:06.501
Why did you let
Monroe go with them?

38:07.869 --> 38:09.041
What's wrong?

38:09.412 --> 38:10.459
Tell me.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.089
Xavier, tell me!
What's going on?

38:18.171 --> 38:20.344
Tell me right now
what's going on!

38:23.426 --> 38:24.769
They made me do it.
They made me.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.350
I thought they
were gonna kill me.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.601
I didn't have a choice.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.318
Did you set them up?
I'm sorry.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.323
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.991
You son of a bitch.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.134
Hey.
What?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.179
You don't seem too worried.

39:00.213 --> 39:02.181
I don't know what you mean.
About going in there.

39:02.257 --> 39:03.258
What's going on?

39:05.426 --> 39:07.428
Oh. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.703
It's Rosalee. I have to answer this.
Something might be wrong.

39:12.684 --> 39:13.981
Are you okay?

39:14.936 --> 39:16.734
- Monroe, it's a trap.
- What?

39:17.021 --> 39:18.523
Xavier set you up.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.404
It's a trap.
They know!

39:28.283 --> 39:29.409
Inside, come on!

39:29.701 --> 39:30.793
Go!
Come on!

39:38.334 --> 39:40.757
Monroe? Oh, my God,
what's happening?

39:41.212 --> 39:43.431
I don't know.
There's a lot of them.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.307
Monroe? Oh, my God.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.265
My God.

39:59.856 --> 40:00.903
This way!

40:08.531 --> 40:09.748
Come in.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.756
Well, we sure
walked into this one.

40:17.332 --> 40:18.972
I thought you said
Xavier was your friend!

40:19.000 --> 40:20.547
He was!
Well, they got to him.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.011
Well, now they're
getting to us.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.055
Up!

40:34.015 --> 40:35.312
We need to
conserve ammunition.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.608
I'll take the first guy
through the door.

40:36.684 --> 40:37.685
Second.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.360
I'll take whoever
you guys miss.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.150
Now!

40:54.869 --> 40:56.462
What the hell's going on?

41:01.334 --> 41:02.381
I'm going out.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.303
Could be another trap
to get us to open that door!

41:04.379 --> 41:05.926
I got this.
Bolt the door behind me.

41:06.005 --> 41:07.177
Nick!

41:23.815 --> 41:24.862
We gonna bolt
that door or what?

41:24.941 --> 41:25.988
No.

41:48.131 --> 41:49.599
- We go out.
- Yeah.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.113
Juliette?
