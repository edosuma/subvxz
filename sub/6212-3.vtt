00:02.520 --> 00:06.810
As the new owner, I intend to turn Hilda’s into Boston’s premium coffee concern.

00:06.939 --> 00:14.780
I will be totally dedicated and personally involved in every critical, coffee related, decision, from the moment we open until the moment we close.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.410
You’re going to be here at five AM?

00:16.490 --> 00:18.830
Five AM? Who’s up and dressed by five AM?

00:19.120 --> 00:20.830
Aargh, that would be our customers.

00:21.040 --> 00:22.750
And my life is supposed to revolve around them?

00:23.710 --> 00:25.000
Hello, waiting for coffee.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.210
Hello, having a meeting.

00:26.330 --> 00:29.420
Hilda, you don’t have to be here all the time. We all take different shifts.

00:29.710 --> 00:30.800
I call the afternoon shift!

00:30.920 --> 00:33.840
You’re the owner, you can take whatever shift you want.

00:33.970 --> 00:37.970
Already, you are becoming my favourite employee. I’m promoting you to manager.

00:38.260 --> 00:39.310
He is the manager.

00:39.390 --> 00:41.470
Could somebody manage to make me a grande-latte?

00:41.560 --> 00:44.480
Pipe-down Frankie, you should be home with your family having breakfast.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.560
Look, I’ll make you a latte and argh...just for your patience, I’ll throw in a free scone.

00:48.690 --> 00:50.570
Listen, don’t bother, I’m out o’ here.

00:50.570 --> 00:54.240
I’m going to the cafe down the block where they, not only, advertise coffee, they sell it.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.030
Wait, come back!

00:58.070 --> 01:00.160
Or better yet, take me with you!

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

01:39.570 --> 01:43.790
Four bucks for a cup of coffee? These prices are outrageous. What am I paying you?

01:43.790 --> 01:45.040
Minimum wage.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.000
Oh! Hilda’s getting a beamer.

01:47.830 --> 01:52.040
Hilda, argh normally, at the end of the day, we split the money in the tip-jar. Is that OK with you?

01:52.170 --> 01:54.420
Absolutely, I can always use extra cash.

01:55.880 --> 02:00.590
Er, a few things you should know about my aunt. She’s insane, she’s insane and oh yeah, she’s insane.

02:01.050 --> 02:04.720
She’s just new. It’ll take her a few weeks to learn the ropes,

02:04.720 --> 02:08.729
but while she’s learning, I could think of something that would soften the blow.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.229
Taking the next few weeks off?

02:10.770 --> 02:14.030
Aargh, I was thinking more along the lines of dinner, Saturday night?

02:14.110 --> 02:15.860
Josh, how can I put this?

02:16.070 --> 02:18.150
How about ‘Sounds great Josh, I’d love to go’?

02:18.280 --> 02:23.450
Look, I made up my mind when I started college that I was gonna try dating new people.

02:23.620 --> 02:27.460
So date new people. Hi, I’m Irvin, have we met?

02:27.580 --> 02:31.920
Look Irving, nice to meet you but could you please tell Josh it ain't gonna happen?

02:32.080 --> 02:34.550
Why not? What, you don’t think we’d have fun?

02:40.470 --> 02:44.220
I’m asking you for a date Sabrina, not to pick out a house and names for the kids.

02:44.220 --> 02:48.680
Good, ‘cause I am too young to commit to the two storey Victorian with the big back yard for little Courtney and Todd.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.600
Todd? You’d name a kid Todd?

02:51.600 --> 02:56.900
The point is, I dated the same guy all through high school. I owe it to myself to experience something new.

02:56.900 --> 03:01.570
Let’s move it flunkies. I’m not paying you people minimum wage to sit around and yak.

03:01.570 --> 03:04.450
So, are we still friends?

03:04.450 --> 03:06.580
Right, friends.

03:11.710 --> 03:15.710
Someone looks down, is everything OK?

03:15.710 --> 03:17.130
Yeah, I guess.

03:17.130 --> 03:22.800
I am sure that it’s nothing that a double mochaccino can’t cure. Come on, I’m buying.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.050
It’s on the house.

03:24.050 --> 03:27.060
In your dreams, Bean Boy. Four bucks.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.440
Oh!

03:34.730 --> 03:37.480
Wow! Nice... footwear!

03:37.820 --> 03:42.450
Thank you. I wasn’t sure if open toes were too bold for the academic environment.

03:42.450 --> 03:50.660
Oh no, I like open toes. Open toed shoes. I like shoes in general. I mean I don’t have a shoe fetish or anything. I also like socks...but not with sandals.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.540
You sure have a lot of books Miles.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.000
You know my name?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.840
You’re in my physics class.

03:55.840 --> 04:02.010
Yes. Yes I am and may I say that I’m flattered and impressed that out of all those students you’ve remembered my name.

04:02.010 --> 04:04.340
You’re also Sabrina’s room-mate.

04:04.340 --> 04:09.180
Good point, I am her room-mate. I mean we don’t actually live in the same room, it’s strictly platonic.

04:09.180 --> 04:13.140
Yes, I’m familiar with the situation. I’ll see you in class Miles.

04:13.140 --> 04:16.440
Right! That’s me, Miles.

04:17.570 --> 04:23.900
So let me get this straight. The problem is you like a guy who likes you but you don’t wanna date him because the relationship has potential?

04:23.900 --> 04:27.580
Exactly. Next thing you know, we’re boyfriend and girlfriend and I can kiss dating other guys goodbye.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.200
Please tell me this is not the worst problem you’ve ever had?

04:30.200 --> 04:35.710
So not. The worst was when Harvey and Josh were fighting over me...but you probably don’t wanna hear about that.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.460
And yet, it’s already too late.

04:38.540 --> 04:44.130
Hey Sabrina. Hey. Hi, I’m...I’m Pete, from your English Lit. class. I was wondering if you’d er if you’d like to um...

04:44.130 --> 04:46.470
Grade your pick-up line? ‘D’ minus.

04:47.050 --> 04:48.350
That wasn’t a pick-up line.

04:48.350 --> 04:51.930
Oh actually it was. Do you argh, do you wanna' go to a movie Saturday night?

04:51.930 --> 04:56.690
Oh well Pete, you know I...I’d love to go out with you but I’ve got plans.

04:56.690 --> 04:59.480
What plans? You told me you weren’t doing anything

04:59.480 --> 05:03.860
Well, I said that because I didn’t want you to feel bad because my plans didn’t include you.

05:03.860 --> 05:05.910
Oh really, when were you gonna tell me?

05:05.910 --> 05:08.780
Hello? Hi, argh, I’m the one being rejected here.

05:08.780 --> 05:11.290
Sorry, thanks for asking.

05:11.290 --> 05:13.450
So what are you doing Saturday night?

05:13.450 --> 05:14.540
Nothing. Wanna come along?

05:14.540 --> 05:19.460
Hold on a second. Although I’m flattered, didn’t you just say you wanted to date new people? What’s wrong with Pete?

05:19.460 --> 05:21.420
I couldn’t date that guy, did you see what he was wearing?

05:21.420 --> 05:23.380
Two dimples and perfect teeth?

05:23.380 --> 05:25.590
A white shirt. Who wears white after Labour Day?

05:25.590 --> 05:28.890
You know, for a girl who wants to date different people, you sure are picky.

05:28.890 --> 05:33.310
The guy at the pizza place was too tall, the guy at the student union was too tanned.

05:33.310 --> 05:38.230
I just don’t like that whole tall, dark, handsome thing. Besides, I don’t see you going out with a whole lot o’ guys.

05:38.230 --> 05:42.530
I don’t see a whole lot o’ guys asking me. What's your problem, loser?

05:42.530 --> 05:44.360
I can’t imagine why.

05:50.740 --> 05:53.080
So much for my afternoon nap.

05:50.370 --> 05:56.250
Salem, what are you doing in my bed? I told you never to sleep in my bed.

05:56.250 --> 05:59.380
You say a lot of things sweetheart. What’s eatin’ ya?

05:59.380 --> 06:06.550
I’m in crisis, I’m way to picky about guys. I wanna date but I just can’t get myself to say yes

06:06.550 --> 06:08.720
and the thought of putting myself out there again is scary.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.930
Try a dating spell, it worked for me when I was a strapping young hunk. B

06:12.930 --> 06:16.930
elieve it or not, when it comes to the fairer sex, I’m rather shy.

06:16.930 --> 06:19.810
Is that why you had four different species slap you with a restraining order?

06:19.810 --> 06:23.690
I promised myself I wouldn’t use magic to solve every little problem.

06:23.690 --> 06:28.320
Great! Then Saturday night we can rent ‘Steel Magnolias’ and you can give me a flea dip. Later.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.320
I need a dating spell and I need it fast.

06:30.320 --> 06:36.080
I’ve been meaning to use my new magic CD-ROM anyway.

06:37.460 --> 06:44.050
OK, here we go. ‘D’s. Dakaries, dandruff, dates!

06:44.050 --> 06:49.800
OK, wrong kind o’ dates. Here we go, Dating.

06:52.760 --> 06:57.930
Oh hey, Sabrina Spellman, I’m Roger Lodge. Word has it that you want a date.

06:57.930 --> 07:00.230
Wow, this eight-point-O version works really fast.

07:00.230 --> 07:03.020
Having trouble finding guys who wanna go out with you?

07:03.020 --> 07:05.730
No, I’ve got plenty of guys. I just can’t bring myself to say yes.

07:05.730 --> 07:07.940
Please tell me that’s not your biggest problem?

07:07.940 --> 07:10.150
Actually, people saying that is my biggest problem.

07:10.150 --> 07:15.080
Okay, here’s your spell. ‘The guys who ask Sabrina out are tired of waiting,

07:15.080 --> 07:22.250
from now on Sabrina will say yes to dating’. OK, you’re good to go.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.960
Roger that...Roger.

07:25.130 --> 07:30.220
‘V’ is volume, ‘T’ is Calvin temperature and ‘K’ is the constant dependent on the number of holes and the pressure of the gas.

07:30.220 --> 07:33.930
My goodness, I was four hundred and six before I grasped that concept.

07:33.930 --> 07:34.760
What?

07:34.760 --> 07:39.890
I said, out of four hundred and six students, you’re the only one who grasped that concept.

07:39.890 --> 07:46.400
I love this stuff. I eat, sleep and breath thermo-dynamics. When the other kids were playing with Lego, I was building my first cyclotron.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.780
There’s nothing more exciting than your first particle-accelerator.

07:49.780 --> 07:53.240
Oh yes there is, meeting someone whose eyes don’t glaze over when I talk.

07:53.240 --> 08:00.370
Been there. Miles, I’m considering having a private study group at the house, for my more advanced students.

08:00.370 --> 08:02.330
Would you be interested in something like that?

08:02.330 --> 08:03.620
Very interested.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.710
I think we should keep it small.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.750
I agree, intimate is better.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.460
What about you and me...

08:09.460 --> 08:09.920
Perfect!

08:09.920 --> 08:14.340
...and Adam and Jenny? Oh dear, my only free night is Saturday night.

08:14.340 --> 08:21.310
Saturday’s my only free night too, another thing we have in common. I guess it was meant to be.

08:21.310 --> 08:24.520
Would you mind telling Adam and Jenny?

08:24.520 --> 08:32.820
And do you, Miles, promise to love, honour and cherish Professor Spellman until alien forces take over the planet and harvest you for food?

08:32.820 --> 08:35.409
I do.

08:38.450 --> 08:39.370
You do?

08:43.159 --> 08:49.380
I mean...I will...tell Adam and Jenny. They’re in my next wedding night...I mean... class.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.550
Hey Adam, hey Jenny.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.060
Hey Miles, what’s happenin’?

08:59.060 --> 09:02.560
Absolutely nothing that concerns you. Hi ladies, gorgeous day.

09:02.560 --> 09:06.850
It’s raining you freak. What’s with alien boy? He’s way too happy.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.320
Maybe his Mr. Spock ears finally came in the mail.

09:09.320 --> 09:10.150
Heads up!

09:11.570 --> 09:12.490
Nice catch.

09:12.490 --> 09:14.320
Yeah, I’m here on a football scholarship.

09:14.320 --> 09:19.830
Then I look forward to the next huddle. In the meantime um would you like to go out Saturday night?

09:19.830 --> 09:22.200
What do you have? Some sort of a magical spell?

09:22.200 --> 09:30.170
Yeah right, good one. Aargh, look, I’m flattered but at this point in my life, I just have to say...yes!

09:30.170 --> 09:32.710
Excellent. Um, do you like sushi?

09:32.710 --> 09:33.550
I love sushi!

09:33.550 --> 09:34.630
You hate sushi.

09:34.630 --> 09:35.880
Pick me up at nine?

09:35.880 --> 09:36.510
Sure.

09:36.510 --> 09:40.850
Well you’ve done a one-eighty. You actually decided to say yes to a date.

09:40.850 --> 09:45.810
I realised I had nothing to lose by seeing what’s out there and making an informed, intelligent choice.

09:45.810 --> 09:50.610
Oh! Yo-yo Pete! Look, I’m available for Saturday night if you still wanna go out?

09:50.610 --> 09:52.610
But I thought you had big plans to do nothing?

09:52.610 --> 09:54.360
Oh that’s just an expression. Pick me up at Seven?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.110
Yeah great, see you Saturday.

09:56.110 --> 09:57.360
You told Joe to pick you up at nine!

09:57.360 --> 10:00.950
Oh, good point. Make it six! And that way I can still fit in...hey, you!

10:06.000 --> 10:12.920
Excuse me, you have been here for three hours. You have paid for one cup of coffee and had six glasses of free water.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.550
Which reminds me, where’s the bathroom?

10:15.550 --> 10:19.050
At your house! And take some of these other free-loaders with you.

10:19.050 --> 10:23.140
And from now on, water’s a buck a glass!

10:23.100 --> 10:28.980
You know what Josh? I think I’m getting ripped-off. The old owner said he had a lot of business.

10:28.980 --> 10:29.980
The old owner did.

10:29.980 --> 10:32.900
At this rate I’ll be chapter eleven by the end of the week.

10:32.900 --> 10:36.490
If you’re lucky. Half the customers have already switched to the French Roast Cafe.

10:36.490 --> 10:43.490
I never liked the French. Look, we’re not dead yet, we just have to figure out angle to win the customers back.

10:43.490 --> 10:45.490
What was the angle when the place first opened?

10:45.490 --> 10:47.080
Aargh...the owner was nice.

10:47.080 --> 10:53.090
We’re dead. There has to be another way...I know! We’ll have a marketing blitz.

10:53.090 --> 10:56.550
We’ll give away key-chains, coasters! Fly-swatters! Not the good ones.

10:56.550 --> 11:01.430
Hilda, why don’t you just dress up some poor shmo like a giant cappuccino and parade him up and down the street?

11:07.080 --> 11:09.310
What? It was your idea.

11:11.900 --> 11:12.940
This was fun, Paul.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.520
Yeah, it’s Pete.

11:14.520 --> 11:18.740
Are you sure? Oh yep, six PM, Pete, you’re right.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.400
Are you dating a Paul too?

11:20.400 --> 11:28.040
Um, two Paul’s and a John Paul but not the one you’re thinking of, but if his eminence does call, I am free Thursday night. Gotta go

11:29.790 --> 11:31.000
Oh, hi Dave.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.040
It’s Bob.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.290
Right, Bob, the psyche major.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.090
Actually I’m a statistics major.

11:36.090 --> 11:38.630
With a minor in boredom.

11:38.630 --> 11:42.510
OK, well give me sixty point two five seconds, I just gotta grab a sweater.

11:42.510 --> 11:47.680
No problem, it’ll give Roxie and me a chance to finish our discussion of census taking procedures in post war Denmark.

11:47.680 --> 11:51.730
I’d love to but...nobody should have to pick out a sweater alone.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.110
What do you think you’re doing?

11:58.030 --> 12:02.610
Two days ago you didn’t wanna' go near a guy, now you’re going on twelve dates a night and I’ve become your social secretary?

12:02.610 --> 12:06.370
By the way, Tad called. He’s running a tad late. Another one.

12:06.370 --> 12:11.710
I don’t get it, first you criticise me for being picky, then you criticise me for going out? I think you just like to criticise.

12:11.710 --> 12:16.000
Sabrina, when you go out with each guy for only ten minutes, how do you even know who they are?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.710
Who cares? The point is I’m dating. Just like you said I should.

12:18.710 --> 12:23.180
Fine. Do what you want but I’m not taking anymore messages.

12:23.180 --> 12:25.890
Hello? No, she’s not here.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.510
Who was that?

12:27.510 --> 12:28.390
My mother.

12:36.310 --> 12:39.070
Mrs. Spellmanson. I mean Miss Spellman.

12:39.070 --> 12:40.940
Oh Miles, you scared me.

12:40.940 --> 12:43.280
Sorry, I have that affect on a lot of people.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.820
You’re the first one here. As soon as Adam and Jenny arrive, we can begin.

12:46.820 --> 12:53.540
Oh, Jenny and Adam called and said they’d be a little late. I guess not everyone’s as dedicated to science as we are.

12:53.540 --> 13:00.000
Oh, well I suppose we could begin without them. I guess you’ll have the leg-up.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.010
Let’s discuss the concept of gravity.

13:03.010 --> 13:10.560
Ah, the irresistible force that draws two bodies together. I love gravity. Is there a Mr. Spellman?

13:10.560 --> 13:18.150
You mean daddy? Oh, you mean...no there isn’t. But let’s just stick to the subject at hand.

13:18.150 --> 13:22.440
You do have beautiful hands, and look...we both have slender pinkies.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.860
So we do. Anyway...

13:24.860 --> 13:26.070
May I call you Zelda?

13:26.070 --> 13:26.610
No.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.620
I feel like a complete dork!

13:29.620 --> 13:36.920
Well of course you feel like a dork, you’re a cappuccino without any foam. Now hit it!

13:36.920 --> 13:40.290
Come to Hilda’s coffee house,

13:40.290 --> 13:42.050
she roasts the finest beans.

13:42.050 --> 13:44.420
Come to Hilda’s coffee house,

13:44.420 --> 13:46.010
she’s no longer mean.

13:46.010 --> 13:48.800
Come to Hilda’s coffee house,

13:48.800 --> 13:53.850
she’s super-dooper nice...Hilda! This is ridiculous. You’re song is so stupid!

13:53.850 --> 13:59.520
You are one bitter cup of coffee. Hey, where are you going? He hasn’t even done the thing with the spoon yet.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.480
They’re all going to the French Roast Cafe.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.940
Oh come on people, give me a break. No one's ruder than the French!

14:04.940 --> 14:08.160
Of course my father.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.120
He’s so rude, he makes the French look like the Swiss.

14:13.370 --> 14:19.460
Oh and speaking of the Swiss, what’s the deal with the cheese? If those are air-holes, what’s living in there?

14:19.460 --> 14:26.590
Am I right? And what’s with the Swiss army? How can they defend an entire nation with those teeny little red knives?

14:26.590 --> 14:33.680
I got a million of them but I left them in there. At Hilda’s, where every latte comes with a laugh and free water...

14:33.680 --> 14:36.730
well just the first glass. Come and join me won't you?

14:36.730 --> 14:41.230
Well this was fun, I’ve never been to a bowling alley that served sushi before.

14:41.230 --> 14:43.940
I’m up scoring and the yellow tail’s always fresh.

14:43.940 --> 14:47.240
This has been one of the best bowling and fish dates I’ve ever been on.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.990
Look Sabrina, I really like you.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.950
And I really like bowling and fish, so this date worked out perfectly.

14:53.950 --> 14:59.670
No, I mean this is like one of the best first dates I’ve ever had and um...I’m really looking forward to a second?

14:59.670 --> 15:04.420
Oh, well it’s gonna' be a while. See, I’m still on my cycle of first dates.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.210
Well it’s only fair that I date everybody once before I start on round two.

15:07.210 --> 15:11.010
Everybody? Round two? What is this, the Sabrina open?

15:11.010 --> 15:13.300
Exactly, I’m open to dating anyone who asks.

15:13.300 --> 15:19.190
Oh by the way, tell your room-mate, racket-ball and Mongolian barbeque sounds perfect. Thanks for a great evening Jim.

15:19.190 --> 15:19.940
It’s Joe.

15:19.940 --> 15:22.230
I’ve gotta' get name-tags.

15:25.150 --> 15:28.860
Hey Spellman, do you wanna' watch me drop in on a half-pipe?

15:28.860 --> 15:33.070
No, but I do wanna' thank you for introducing me to that dating spell that’s working out great.

15:33.070 --> 15:38.370
Yeah well before you step out with Manny, Mo and Jack, you might wanna' stop by ‘Pet-Boys’ for an alignment.

15:38.370 --> 15:43.250
What are you talking about? What’s wrong with me?

15:43.250 --> 15:48.710
Big picture, you’re obsessive-compulsive but the immediate problem requires a seasoned chiropractor.

15:48.710 --> 15:54.550
It must be that stupid dating spell...or maybe I’ve got to start bowling with a lighter ball.

15:54.550 --> 15:58.060
I’ve gotta get this spell off right away. Roger, are you there?

15:58.060 --> 16:04.940
I’m on it Sabrina. ’Poor Sabrina’s not looking well, so quickly remove this dating spell.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.900
Nothing’s happened! What am I going to do?

16:09.900 --> 16:17.830
Do what you always do. Go crying to your aunties to bail you out, boo-hoo-hoo! Help me aunties! Ha-ha-ha!

16:20.370 --> 16:23.920
I’m an independent woman, I don’t need my aunts for help.

16:26.880 --> 16:37.100
Yeah, this is easy. All right, head misalignment. Go to aunts for help’ Boo-hoo-hoo!

16:38.350 --> 16:42.390
Miles, you and I are not involved, nor will we ever be involved, capich?

16:42.390 --> 16:48.900
love it when you speak Italian. Admit it my Mamazelda, you feel an urge for little Milo too.

16:48.900 --> 16:53.700
Unless you’re talking about the urge to toss you out on your canolli, I feel nothing of the kind.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.370
Aunt Hilda! Aunt Zelda! Look!

16:56.370 --> 16:58.410
Sabrina?

16:58.410 --> 17:00.910
Whoops! I’ll just be in the kitchen trying to straighten myself out.

17:00.910 --> 17:07.079
Did I just see Sabrina’s head sliding off her body?

17:07.079 --> 17:11.920
You poor dear, those over zealous hormones are causing you to hallucinate.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.720
Is that, in any way, attractive to you?

17:13.720 --> 17:14.260
No.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.470
Good lord Sabrina, what’s going on?

17:19.470 --> 17:27.060
I have no idea. Salem convinced me to put a dating spell on myself and it was going great until my neck turned into a slinky! I removed the spell but it just keeps getting worse.

17:27.060 --> 17:28.190
Here, hold this.

17:32.190 --> 17:36.530
Sabrina, when a witch is misaligned, it’s rarely caused by a problematic spell.

17:36.530 --> 17:41.200
It usually signals a deeper problem that was there before the spell was incanted.

17:41.200 --> 17:45.080
Great, why couldn’t I take after the mortal side? Their worst ailment is an occasional hive.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.960
There, that ought to hold you until we figure out what’s wrong.

17:47.960 --> 17:51.300
A nice look for winter, but not great with a bikini.

17:51.300 --> 17:55.340
Sabrina, why did you need a dating spell? You’ve never had trouble getting dates before?

17:55.340 --> 17:58.510
The spell wasn’t to help me get dates, it was to make me more comfortable accepting them.

17:58.510 --> 18:01.140
Well what do you think made you uncomfortable in the first place?

18:01.140 --> 18:02.220
I have no idea.

18:02.220 --> 18:05.730
Well, there’s only one way to find out. We’ve got to get to the heart of the matter.

18:05.730 --> 18:08.270
Oh, no! You’re not going to open me up like you did last Valentine’s Day are you?

18:08.270 --> 18:16.110
No need to, today’s technology is more sophisticated. Ooops! I almost forgot.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.160
Hey, look! There’s that nickel I swallowed when I was six.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.120
Heart, speak!

18:22.120 --> 18:24.580
It’s not that I don’t want to date again someday.

18:24.580 --> 18:27.540
Well why are you taking your time? You’ve been moping around all summer.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.920
Let the heart finish.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.460
Thank you. I haven’t been moping, I’ve been healing.

18:31.460 --> 18:33.920
Well the best way to heal is to get back on the horse.

18:33.920 --> 18:38.430
Don’t play head games with me. I’m not ready to get back on the horse, I’m still recovering from the last ride.

18:38.430 --> 18:43.810
Sabrina, its obvious what’s going on here. Your head and your heart are conflicted.

18:43.810 --> 18:44.770
It's not my fault!

18:44.770 --> 18:50.230
That dating spell caused your head to block out what your heart was feeling and that’s why you became misaligned.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.610
Are you finally ready to consider my feelings?

18:52.610 --> 18:55.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You hearts, always with the feelings.

18:55.110 --> 18:59.030
Well I can’t go out just for the sake of going out. I’ve gotta feel something.

18:59.030 --> 19:00.450
Well how will I know when you do?

19:00.450 --> 19:01.870
I’ll give you a little thump.

19:05.120 --> 19:09.710
Well, let’s see if that little talk did the trick.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.840
I can’t believe it! Aunt Zelda, I’m realigned!

19:15.840 --> 19:19.130
Course you are, you’re no longer blocking out the feelings in your heart.

19:19.130 --> 19:24.810
I’m glad...but do you have anything to block out the stomach? I think that yellow tails starting to swim up-stream.

19:27.640 --> 19:31.440
Hey Josh. Man, am I glad to see you. I’ve had the craziest day.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.900
It couldn’t have been crazier than mine. Your aunt dressed me up like a giant cappuccino.

19:35.900 --> 19:41.200
That’s nothing, you should see the time she dressed me up like a giant pina coloda.. It took me a week to get the coconut out of my hair.

19:41.200 --> 19:46.040
I’m surprised to find you home so early. I thought you’d be out dating around.

19:46.040 --> 19:56.340
Yeah. Yeah it’s so great when you meet someone you connect with and you don’t have to go on a bunch of pointless dates.

19:56.340 --> 20:00.130
I think I’m beginning to agree with you. Whoa!

20:00.130 --> 20:00.720
What’s wrong?

20:00.720 --> 20:01.300
Nothing.

20:01.300 --> 20:07.060
Oh, you and Morgan are...aw!

20:07.060 --> 20:09.310
Are you sure you’re OK? Maybe I should call a doctor...

20:09.310 --> 20:11.020
But we’ll be late for the movie.

20:11.020 --> 20:15.770
Yeah, I’ll be fine. I should probably just cut back on the fries.

20:15.770 --> 20:19.940
You do that. I, um...I guess we should get going.

20:19.940 --> 20:23.030
Yeah. By the way, you look beautiful. It’s a great necklace.

20:23.030 --> 20:24.030
Thank you, it’s mine!

20:24.030 --> 20:26.870
I...I hope you don’t mind me borrowing.

20:26.870 --> 20:29.200
Huh, it looks like I have no choice.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.750
So, argh...I guess we’ll catch up some other time?

20:31.750 --> 20:32.370
Great.

20:32.370 --> 20:33.330
Bye.

20:35.500 --> 20:39.550
You know, you have really stinky timing.

20:46.180 --> 20:51.140
Oi! Aargh, two blondes walk into a building. You’d think one of them would have seen it.

20:51.140 --> 20:57.110
I’m killing. No, I did want to apologies for being rude earlier. I guess I just had a case of new-job jitters.

20:57.110 --> 21:01.570
Have you ever been on a job interview and they’re like ‘Well what was the reason for leaving your last job?’

21:01.570 --> 21:07.870
Well I found that after I was fired, there was a lot of tension in the office. I found it difficult sitting on the new girls lap.

21:07.870 --> 21:14.120
I once had a job as a receptionist. I was so nervous, I kept answering the phone ‘Hello, can you help me?’

21:14.120 --> 21:17.920
Oh, I like that. Hey, why don’t you come up here so we can laugh at you some more?

21:17.920 --> 21:21.760
No, in fact, why don’t we turn this into an open mic night?

21:21.760 --> 21:26.340
If you’ve got a joke or a song? Anything that’ll pack them in here and get me that beamer.
