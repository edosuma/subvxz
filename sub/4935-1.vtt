WEBVTT

00:15.898 --> 00:20.398
They're going in!
Wait for me, for fuck's sake!

00:22.148 --> 00:26.357
Come on, for fuck's sake.
You're so slow! Hop on.

00:28.857 --> 00:33.982
They're betting 1200 on
who jumps in the lake first.

00:34.107 --> 00:38.982
Come on. It's so cold.

00:40.232 --> 00:43.440
Wait for me, for fuck's sake!

00:45.773 --> 00:50.482
- Go. Jump in!
- No, I don't want to.

00:54.857 --> 00:57.440
It's freezing.

01:15.232 --> 01:17.607
Shit, I have a cramp.

01:19.773 --> 01:23.107
- Fucking hell!
- Coming!

01:34.482 --> 01:38.815
Put him in the recovery position.

01:38.940 --> 01:41.357
Pump his chest a little.

01:41.482 --> 01:44.107
Don't fuck him up!

01:46.440 --> 01:51.482
- Did you check the eel traps?
- I want 600. I came second.

01:51.607 --> 01:54.648
There's hot toddy in the car.
Come on, boys.

02:12.148 --> 02:17.357
THE HUNT

03:07.357 --> 03:09.982
Something fishy's going on here.

03:12.232 --> 03:15.607
Oh, it's you, Pelle!
Are you alone?

03:17.857 --> 03:21.773
- Get him! Get him!
- You're too many!

03:23.482 --> 03:27.523
Watch out! I'm dangerous.
This is my new weapon, Pelle.

03:31.565 --> 03:36.523
- Hang up your clothes.
- I have to go number two.

03:36.648 --> 03:40.023
Lucas can help you, then.

03:40.148 --> 03:45.315
Would you please help him?
All his clothes come off.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.815
Is jumping such a great idea?

03:59.273 --> 04:03.440
- I'm done.
- Can you handle it yourself?

04:03.565 --> 04:09.190
- Hello! Wipe.
- Hey, watch your tone.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.440
Come here.

04:12.565 --> 04:15.190
And soap.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.690
Come on.

04:22.315 --> 04:26.190
Hi, Klara. Something wrong?

04:26.315 --> 04:31.190
- I'm lost.
- Oh. Where's Mum and Dad?

04:31.315 --> 04:35.773
At home.
I forgot to look where I was going.

04:35.898 --> 04:39.523
All of a sudden I was here.

04:39.648 --> 04:45.982
You still can't step on the lines?
So you don't know where you're going?

04:46.107 --> 04:51.190
- No, and I don't remember the way.
- That's a shame.

04:53.607 --> 04:56.898
I remember the way.
Why don't we go together?

04:59.065 --> 05:01.107
I'll look up
while you look at the lines?

05:01.232 --> 05:05.773
I'd like that.
ls Fanny coming too?

05:05.898 --> 05:09.690
- Yes, she's coming too.
- Good. She'll watch out for us.

05:13.065 --> 05:18.440
- What's your favourite dish?
- Probably venison.

05:18.565 --> 05:24.107
Mine's fish fingers.
Why do you work in our nursery?

05:24.232 --> 05:30.482
Well, I was a teacher at your
brother's school, but then it closed.

05:32.398 --> 05:37.523
My dad says you're sad because
you live alone in a big house.

05:37.648 --> 05:39.690
Does he now?

05:39.815 --> 05:44.440
Keep your head high
and your feet on the ground.

05:44.565 --> 05:47.940
If you are still sulking,
you can get a kick up the arse.

05:51.648 --> 05:55.773
- Did your dad teach you that?
- You can get a kick up the arse.

05:55.898 --> 06:01.898
- Can I come and walk Fanny?
- As often as you like.

06:02.023 --> 06:05.065
Try calling her.

06:05.190 --> 06:08.398
- Fanny!
- Louder.

06:08.523 --> 06:12.440
Fanny! Come here!

06:12.565 --> 06:17.648
- Klara, where have you been?
- At the supermarket.

06:17.773 --> 06:23.107
Sweetie. Haven't I told you
not to run away from home?

06:23.273 --> 06:27.273
- You want coffee?
- Fanny, come.

06:27.440 --> 06:31.523
- Go to your room.
- Shit!

06:31.648 --> 06:35.982
- Look what I found in the gutter.
- Hi, Lucas.

06:36.107 --> 06:38.773
Hi, Fanny.
Who's a good girl?

06:39.940 --> 06:45.190
Hi, babe. You didn't put that thing
away like you promised.

06:45.315 --> 06:48.190
Do you also leave
your sporting gun lying about?

06:49.815 --> 06:54.357
I've told you, it's a rifle.
It's not a sport.

06:54.523 --> 06:57.107
- Torsten!
- Torsten!

06:59.232 --> 07:01.815
Young lady,
you have some thinking to do.

07:01.898 --> 07:05.232
We're off to buy football boots.

07:05.357 --> 07:08.982
Don't touch the pie! I mean it!

07:09.107 --> 07:11.732
It better be in one piece.
Torsten, are you coming?

07:14.065 --> 07:19.190
Drop in one of these days.
We'll make lasagne.

07:19.315 --> 07:20.898
Lasagneâ€œ.

07:29.107 --> 07:35.190
She'll be furious.
Like that. I got it.

07:35.315 --> 07:38.565
How are things
with Marcus and your ex?

07:38.690 --> 07:40.482
Everything's fine.

07:43.648 --> 07:49.815
I can tell when you're lying.
Your eye twitches.

07:49.940 --> 07:53.732
- Really?
- Don't lie to me, Lucas.

07:55.273 --> 07:59.190
She'll only let me see him
every other weekend.

07:59.315 --> 08:02.232
Call Kirsten.

08:02.357 --> 08:07.315
Forget the lawyers.
Quiet, Fanny!

08:07.440 --> 08:11.940
Then don't mention Kirsten.
Stop it, Fanny!

08:12.065 --> 08:18.190
- Do you miss Marcus?
- Of course I miss my boy.

08:18.315 --> 08:22.565
- Pick up the phone and call Kirsten.
- Stop!

08:22.690 --> 08:26.982
- Down, stupid dog!
- Stop it.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.232
Shame on you!

08:30.565 --> 08:36.148
He's unhappy that it's twelve days
at your place and two at mine.

08:36.273 --> 08:39.565
<i>I think it works fine.</i>

08:39.732 --> 08:42.898
Can I say something?
Thank you.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.398
He wants to spend
more time here.

08:46.523 --> 08:50.065
He said that
you were okay with it.

08:50.190 --> 08:52.523
Isn't that true?

08:52.648 --> 08:57.815
<i>Lucas, what else could he say?
He feels sorry for you.</i>

08:57.940 --> 09:02.898
- Come again? He feels sorry for me?
- <i>Of</i> course!

09:03.023 --> 09:07.607
- Please behave like an adult.
- You <i>have</i> to sez' yourself aside.

09:07.732 --> 09:12.232
I do, damn it!
He was the one who asked.

09:12.357 --> 09:17.315
<i>You can't even keep an agreement.
You're not supposed to call me.</i>

09:18.273 --> 09:23.482
When are we supposed to talk,
if you don't call, and I can't call?

09:23.565 --> 09:25.690
When can we talk then?

09:26.607 --> 09:31.857
- I'm <i>hanging</i> up.
- No. When can we talk? Kirsten?

09:57.315 --> 10:01.148
Old rod, big rod, crooked rod,
wrinkly rod...

10:01.273 --> 10:04.565
- Rod, rod, rod!
- Hi, Klara.

10:04.690 --> 10:07.773
Look, Klara.
A giant stiff rod.

10:07.898 --> 10:13.232
- Let's go to my room.
- Massive hooker rod!

10:21.440 --> 10:25.648
- Good morning, Klara.
- Good morning.

10:25.773 --> 10:32.648
<i>- Listen, you have to take her.
- You never keep an agreement!</i>

10:32.773 --> 10:34.232
<i>We don't have an agreement!</i>

10:34.357 --> 10:38.565
Are they arguing? Are you sad?

10:38.690 --> 10:42.440
No, he can have
a kick up the arse.

10:42.565 --> 10:47.982
<i>If you have children,
you must take them to nursery!</i>

10:48.107 --> 10:53.815
- Shall I take you to nursery?
- I'd like that.

10:53.940 --> 10:57.023
I'll let your clad know.

10:57.148 --> 11:01.398
<i>- Hi. You're making a racket.
- We can'! find Klara.</i>

11:01.523 --> 11:06.232
- She's here. Why don't I take her?
- Yes, of course. Bye.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.940
It's okay. Let's go.

11:12.898 --> 11:17.732
You can look where we're going,
then I'll look out for lines.

12:02.773 --> 12:07.023
You're so weak!

12:07.107 --> 12:11.482
Who wants to fly?

12:13.273 --> 12:15.857
- Me too!
- Come here, then.

12:19.190 --> 12:22.732
I need a break. I'm dying here.

12:22.857 --> 12:26.607
- Me too!
- Me too!

12:26.732 --> 12:30.732
- He's dying.
- Yeah!

12:31.898 --> 12:36.857
- Wake up!
- Come on, wake up!

12:36.982 --> 12:40.440
Who's waking the dead?

12:40.565 --> 12:43.565
Here's the hand of death.

12:47.273 --> 12:49.565
Time for fruit.

12:52.107 --> 12:58.315
We'll be right there.
Clean up first. Klara...

13:01.565 --> 13:05.565
I found a small present
in my coat pocket.

13:10.315 --> 13:14.148
I think you should give it
to one of the boys.

13:16.940 --> 13:22.690
- It's not from me.
- But it says "Klara".

13:24.440 --> 13:28.023
Then someone must be teasing you.

13:30.190 --> 13:35.148
Why don't you give it to your mum
or the person who made it?

13:35.273 --> 13:38.857
And kissing on the lips
is only for Mum and Dad.

13:40.482 --> 13:43.898
It's not from me.
You're lying.

13:46.190 --> 13:50.440
- It's not from me.
- Klara?

13:52.107 --> 13:55.773
Boys. Tidy up.
And wash your hands.

13:55.898 --> 14:00.482
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

14:02.065 --> 14:06.107
Hi, Pelle and Janus.

14:13.898 --> 14:19.315
Hi, sweetie. Are you still here?
Your mum will be here in a minute.

14:21.648 --> 14:23.898
Excited about Christmas?

14:25.690 --> 14:30.690
Do you remember the carol?
Let's sing it.

14:40.773 --> 14:44.065
I hate Lucas.

14:44.190 --> 14:47.857
- I thought you were friends.
- We're not.

14:48.940 --> 14:50.565
Why not?

14:52.065 --> 14:56.232
He's stupid, and he's ugly.

14:57.857 --> 15:02.773
- And he has a willie.
- Most men do.

15:03.232 --> 15:05.690
So does your dad and Torsten.

15:09.398 --> 15:16.690
Yes, but his is pointing
straight out. Like a rod.

15:19.315 --> 15:23.523
- Why do you say that?
- Because it does.

15:27.398 --> 15:29.107
Did something happen, Klara?

15:31.648 --> 15:35.898
He gave me this heart,
but I don't want it.

15:38.982 --> 15:43.690
That's no good.
Then throw it away.

15:45.940 --> 15:49.107
Is Santa coming this year?

15:49.232 --> 15:53.440
Yeah... You never know.

15:53.565 --> 15:59.315
- I think he will.
- If you've been nice, he will.

15:59.440 --> 16:05.565
Hi, Grethe. Hi, sweetheart.
Are you sitting in the dark?

16:05.648 --> 16:12.065
I'm so sorry.
I came as fast as I could.

16:13.107 --> 16:18.523
Did you have fun?
Something on your mind?

16:18.648 --> 16:23.523
No, we've collected mushrooms
and turds in the woods today.

16:23.648 --> 16:27.815
Sounds nice!
Come on. Let's go home.

16:27.940 --> 16:32.315
- See you, Klara.
- Bye, Grethe.

16:33.732 --> 16:35.940
Come, sweetie.

16:37.107 --> 16:41.482
Let's hurry home and make dinner.

16:51.690 --> 16:58.065
Okay. Wow.
I'm thrilled to hear that.

16:58.190 --> 17:03.315
- Did something happen?
- Bye-bye, see you!

17:03.440 --> 17:09.190
- <i>Did you</i> talk about <i>it?</i>
- <i>Yes. He wants to live with you.</i>

17:09.315 --> 17:13.815
- <i>He's</i> very angry.
- It'll be perfect.

17:13.940 --> 17:17.357
I'll take him to yours
as often as he wants.

17:18.857 --> 17:20.897
Are you okay?

17:22.107 --> 17:25.982
<i>You'd better talk to him.
I'll go get him.</i>

17:27.022 --> 17:30.607
Sorry. I'll just go through here.

17:30.732 --> 17:36.440
<i>Dad? It's great. But I can't
change schools before Christmas.</i>

17:36.565 --> 17:40.648
- We'll <i>manage.</i>
<i>- I'd better go and see to Mum.</i>

17:40.773 --> 17:46.065
Okay. And Marcus,
be nice to her. It's not easy.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.857
<i>- Of</i> course. <i>Bye.</i>
- I love you. See you soon.

17:56.815 --> 17:59.648
- Sorry. Hi.

18:01.732 --> 18:06.315
That was my son.
He's going to live with me now.

18:13.398 --> 18:14.940
Coffee...

18:17.107 --> 18:19.315
Coffee now? Here?

18:19.440 --> 18:20.898
Yes.

18:22.232 --> 18:26.065
Let's have some coffee.
You want milk?

18:26.190 --> 18:29.232
No. I want it black and strong.

18:42.690 --> 18:48.065
<i>You're supposed to be gentle, right?
Do the dishes.</i>

19:01.273 --> 19:04.440
Just like this?

19:14.273 --> 19:16.273
Thank you.

19:23.565 --> 19:27.398
- Will you clean up the playground?
- Sure.

19:53.565 --> 19:56.648
- See you tomorrow.
- Monday.

19:57.857 --> 20:01.607
- Tomorrow.
- No, on Monday. It's weekend.

20:05.690 --> 20:09.315
I like it when we can see each other.

20:12.357 --> 20:14.440
Me too.

20:17.482 --> 20:19.648
Come here.

20:20.857 --> 20:22.607
You're sweet.

20:27.232 --> 20:28.940
You too.

21:48.398 --> 21:52.357
Let's put it here.

21:52.482 --> 21:55.357
You can't even hit the sack.

21:55.482 --> 21:59.898
It's the first time
I didn't shoot anything.

22:00.023 --> 22:03.190
It really is.

22:03.315 --> 22:09.023
Perhaps it's your eyes.
You might want to try these.

22:20.107 --> 22:24.523
Listen. I'll call Ulla.

22:24.648 --> 22:28.898
You bring roast pork.
Eel. Black pudding.

22:29.023 --> 22:33.107
- Johan! Apple pork.
- Let's just say cheers.

22:33.232 --> 22:36.107
You'll bring apple pork.

22:37.482 --> 22:40.065
Hello. It's Lucas. Hello?

22:47.107 --> 22:52.148
I can't hear a thing. One moment.
Hello, Lucas here.

23:28.857 --> 23:30.023
It's me.

23:49.773 --> 23:51.898
<i>Pussy! Pussy!</i>

24:00.482 --> 24:03.398
I've been thinking about you a lot.

24:16.648 --> 24:22.023
- Who did you call? A bird?
- Bent, stop it!

24:22.148 --> 24:26.607
Hey, I'm quietly trying to tell you,

24:26.732 --> 24:30.107
that he made a phone call
to a lady!

24:34.565 --> 24:42.857
<i>Would Lucas, would Lucas,
would Lucas drink a beer?</i>

24:52.815 --> 24:56.148
<i>Oh surely, oh surely,
oh surely he would!</i>

24:56.273 --> 24:59.857
<i>Oh surely, oh surely,
oh surely he would.</i>

25:03.232 --> 25:08.732
- I brought a present.
- And it's not even Christmas.

25:08.857 --> 25:11.732
Come on. I'll help you.

25:11.857 --> 25:16.398
- How much did he drink?
- I don't know. Lost count.

25:16.523 --> 25:22.607
- Thank you so much.
- Lucas...

25:22.732 --> 25:28.065
You're my best friend.

25:28.148 --> 25:34.315
- See you. Have you got him?
- Kisses.

25:36.023 --> 25:40.148
I'll call if I need you.
Goodbye.

25:41.398 --> 25:44.523
Agnes...

25:47.065 --> 25:52.273
I need to tell you something.
Do you know why you're so pretty?

25:52.398 --> 25:57.273
- No.
- Because you don't know.

26:02.815 --> 26:07.482
- Oh, honey.
- I love you.

26:12.482 --> 26:15.565
I love you.

26:17.148 --> 26:19.232
I love you. A lot.

26:45.982 --> 26:48.523
Fanny. Fanny.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.690
Fanny, where are you?

26:52.648 --> 26:56.982
Come here. Come!
Thank you for the ball.

28:40.023 --> 28:42.732
I got you! First time ever!
Got you!

28:52.940 --> 28:56.690
- Lucas. Lucas!
- Hi.

28:56.815 --> 29:00.565
- You can't escape me.
- Do you have a minute?

29:00.648 --> 29:04.815
Yeah, just a second.
Boys, I can't catch you.

29:04.940 --> 29:08.898
After I drink some superjuice,
I'll be back.

29:10.982 --> 29:15.857
- Hi, Grethe.
- Please take a seat.

29:15.982 --> 29:21.398
- How's little Marcus?
- Good. He's not so little anymore.

29:22.482 --> 29:26.315
He's planning to move in
with me before Christmas.

29:28.690 --> 29:33.690
I've been racking my brain,
but I can't get it out of my head.

29:37.023 --> 29:42.440
A child has told me something,
I need to talk to you about it.

29:44.773 --> 29:49.857
This child has a vivid imagination,
but I still wanted to mention it.

29:49.982 --> 29:52.482
Sure.
Who are we talking about?

29:54.732 --> 29:56.690
I can't tell you.

30:03.065 --> 30:08.607
The child says things have happened.
Things meant for adults only.

30:12.148 --> 30:15.148
What things?
What has happened?

30:15.273 --> 30:20.107
The child says that
he or she doesn't like you.

30:21.523 --> 30:27.898
And that he or she has seen
your private parts...

30:38.357 --> 30:42.107
How the hell would that
even be possible?

30:42.232 --> 30:43.857
I don't know.

30:50.398 --> 30:51.815
Shit...

30:55.482 --> 30:59.232
It doesn't sound good,
but don't worry.

31:00.190 --> 31:03.523
I'm not jumping to conclusions.
We'll work it out.

31:05.482 --> 31:10.357
- What exactly has been said?
- I can't tell you.

31:12.607 --> 31:17.023
And it's time for fruit
so we'd better move on.

31:20.773 --> 31:25.982
You should take a few days off.
Then we'll sort this out.

31:26.107 --> 31:30.023
Finish your shift today,
and then we'll think of something.

31:30.148 --> 31:32.148
I'll do that.

32:08.857 --> 32:12.273
- Did I keep you waiting?
- No, it's fine.

32:12.398 --> 32:16.273
I'm not sure how this works.

32:17.815 --> 32:20.482
Let's just get started.

32:22.690 --> 32:25.232
Yes, Klara...

32:26.898 --> 32:32.773
Can you try to tell me exactly
what you told Grethe?

32:48.315 --> 32:53.232
Please tell him
what you said about the heart.

33:01.065 --> 33:03.315
I didn't say anything.

33:05.065 --> 33:10.982
Is Grethe just making this up?

33:11.857 --> 33:15.023
Or did you make it up?

33:15.148 --> 33:16.815
No.

33:17.732 --> 33:21.565
Alright...
Then try telling me.

33:29.315 --> 33:32.232
It's okay to tell him.

33:37.398 --> 33:40.607
Is it true that you said

33:40.773 --> 33:44.273
that you had seen Lucas' willie?

33:59.232 --> 34:02.482
Try to tell me what Lucas did.

34:02.648 --> 34:06.023
Tell me about that, Klara.

34:08.482 --> 34:13.357
- I'd like to go out and play.
- You just have to answer.

34:13.482 --> 34:17.773
Don't be afraid.
Ole won't hurt you.

34:17.898 --> 34:20.607
He just wants to know
what's happened.

34:24.357 --> 34:27.982
Did he show you his willie
here in the nursery?

34:30.773 --> 34:33.523
Did he, Klara?

34:38.523 --> 34:40.023
Klara?

34:53.732 --> 34:57.023
You are nodding.

34:57.148 --> 34:59.523
So it was here in nursery?

35:04.023 --> 35:08.148
Tell me what happened, then.

35:10.190 --> 35:13.815
Grethe said that
you said it was pointing.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.482
Was his willie pointing?

35:20.440 --> 35:23.898
I think so. I don't remember.

35:24.023 --> 35:26.440
So he showed you his willie?

35:34.232 --> 35:37.482
Is this uncomfortable to talk about?

35:48.523 --> 35:52.690
Is that because you don't like
what he did?

35:55.732 --> 36:01.273
Klara, you're doing a great job
answering my questions.

36:02.357 --> 36:05.065
We'll be done soon.

36:07.857 --> 36:12.982
What did he do
after he showed you his willie?

36:13.107 --> 36:15.398
I don't really know.

36:17.273 --> 36:19.107
Did you touch it?

36:25.107 --> 36:26.857
Do you remember?

36:28.315 --> 36:29.940
Did...

36:31.648 --> 36:34.857
...something white
come out of it?

36:42.482 --> 36:45.982
Perhaps this is too much at once.

36:46.107 --> 36:49.690
You can go back out and play.

36:49.815 --> 36:54.190
- Really?
- We just need to keep an eye on her.

37:01.440 --> 37:06.648
You and I know each other,
which is fine,

37:06.773 --> 37:12.065
but this is actually a matter
for the police.

37:12.232 --> 37:16.065
And we need the consent
of her parents.

37:16.190 --> 37:20.107
I appreciate your help.
I'm not sure how to handle it.

37:21.273 --> 37:25.107
Klara has a vivid imagination.

37:25.232 --> 37:28.232
But it doesn't seem to be the case.

37:29.107 --> 37:32.148
No, it doesn't appear that way.

37:33.357 --> 37:35.148
No.

37:43.523 --> 37:48.482
Ole says that we have to report it.

37:48.607 --> 37:50.898
We have to notify the authorities.

37:55.857 --> 38:00.357
- The parents' meeting is off, then.
- I don't think so.

38:00.482 --> 38:03.482
We're obliged to inform
the other parents.

38:05.690 --> 38:10.190
- Where's Klara?
- She's outside playing.

38:11.940 --> 38:14.148
Where's Lucas?

38:14.273 --> 38:18.273
He's also outside playing.

38:18.398 --> 38:21.898
- Shouldn't we send him home?
- Yes, we'd better.

38:52.232 --> 38:58.482
Hi, Grethe. We were on our way
to football when you called.

38:58.565 --> 39:03.565
- Please take a seat.
- I thought it was at 7:00pm?

39:03.690 --> 39:07.940
- Is everything okay?
- We need to talk about Klara.

39:08.065 --> 39:13.107
Perhaps Torsten should wait outside.

39:14.107 --> 39:19.940
Wake up. Go and text or
play some games. I'll be right out.

39:22.148 --> 39:27.398
What has she been up to,
that little rascal?

39:29.482 --> 39:35.357
Something has occurred that shouldn't
occur between children and adults.

39:35.482 --> 39:39.898
I haven't been able to prevent it.
I'm terribly sorry.

39:40.023 --> 39:43.982
Klara has recounted
sexual details about an adult.

39:45.690 --> 39:48.773
I don't believe
a child would lie in that way.

39:51.148 --> 39:57.773
It sounds very confusing.
What are you telling me?

39:57.898 --> 40:03.398
It seems that Klara has been
a victim of sexual abuse here.

40:03.523 --> 40:06.565
Probably by someone close to you.

40:09.940 --> 40:13.523
- Sexual abuse?
- The things she said...

40:14.982 --> 40:18.857
She'll probably deny everything
because she's embarrassed.

40:19.732 --> 40:21.398
But...

40:24.357 --> 40:26.607
How?

40:30.273 --> 40:33.398
Let's see how bad it is.

40:37.815 --> 40:41.398
Hi. The cake is here.

40:41.523 --> 40:45.940
- Hi! Is it lactose free?
- Yes.

41:08.357 --> 41:14.023
May I have your attention?
We have a new item on the agenda.

41:17.648 --> 41:24.190
We suspect indecent conduct
towards the children.

41:27.857 --> 41:34.232
There are indications that an adult
has abused one of the children.

41:34.357 --> 41:38.273
Theoretically there might be
more than one victim.

41:43.315 --> 41:49.398
You should be on the lookout
for certain symptoms.

41:49.523 --> 41:55.232
Bedwetting, headaches and nightmares.
This evening we'll go into details.

41:55.357 --> 41:59.148
I'll ask you to read this pamphlet.

41:59.273 --> 42:03.607
This is a very serious accusation.

42:03.732 --> 42:06.732
Yes. But there's no need for panic.

42:06.857 --> 42:11.773
We will of course follow
procedures to the letter.

42:24.815 --> 42:28.773
Good morning, Marcus. Hello?

42:30.565 --> 42:32.023
Hello?

42:33.273 --> 42:36.648
- <i>Dad...</i>
- Why are you whispering?

42:39.107 --> 42:41.565
<i>They won't let me call you.</i>

42:44.148 --> 42:49.315
Who won't allow you?
Did something happen?

42:53.565 --> 42:55.815
Marcus, are you crying?

42:57.357 --> 43:00.648
<i>They're saying all these things
about you.</i>

43:00.773 --> 43:03.107
<i>I'm not allowed to talk to you.</i>

43:03.273 --> 43:06.232
- <i>Or allowed to move.</i>
- <i>Who</i> said <i>that? Your mother?</i>

43:07.773 --> 43:13.190
<i>They said that something disgusting
happened in the nursery.</i>

43:17.732 --> 43:21.190
Don't listen to them. It's not true.

43:23.107 --> 43:27.023
- <i>Who</i> called <i>you?</i>
- <i>Grefhe from the nurse/y.</i>

43:31.565 --> 43:37.107
Just go to school.
I'll talk to you tonight.

43:37.232 --> 43:42.023
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Don't worry about it.

43:48.315 --> 43:52.232
I should have told you... Sorry.
Yesterday...

43:53.773 --> 44:00.815
I was told that a kid had said
I had shown him my willie.

44:00.940 --> 44:02.648
Or to her.

44:16.440 --> 44:17.857
Yes.

44:20.815 --> 44:23.607
Now Marcus' mother
also knows about it.

44:38.232 --> 44:40.648
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:42.357 --> 44:44.732
Boys, not now.

44:46.398 --> 44:50.773
- Is Grethe in?
- I thought you were on leave.

44:50.898 --> 44:52.482
I just need to...

44:57.482 --> 45:00.732
What are you doing here?
What's going on?

45:02.357 --> 45:07.148
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm in the middle of something.

45:14.065 --> 45:18.482
You'd better go home.
Leave Grethe alone.

45:18.607 --> 45:21.023
Grethe.

45:24.148 --> 45:25.815
Grethe, come here.

45:28.065 --> 45:29.898
Stop it.

45:30.023 --> 45:33.398
Why are you leaving?
This is absurd.

45:33.523 --> 45:37.315
Don't come here
when I've asked you not to.

45:37.440 --> 45:41.107
- I'm not hurting anyone.
- Stop right there!

45:41.232 --> 45:45.607
- How could you do it? It's sick.
- What did I do?

45:45.773 --> 45:52.398
- It's wrong to be here with you.
- Let me tell you what's wrong.

45:52.523 --> 45:58.440
You called Marcus' mother,
and now he's not allowed to come.

45:58.565 --> 46:00.773
What do you suppose he's thinking?

46:01.273 --> 46:04.982
I believe the children.
They don't lie.

46:06.148 --> 46:11.523
You leave Marcus alone.
Do you understand?

46:11.648 --> 46:16.940
You leave my children alone.
Klara is an innocent, little girl.

46:18.982 --> 46:21.982
Is it Klara?
Grethe, is it Klara?

46:22.107 --> 46:25.523
We'd better stop now. Let's go.

46:25.648 --> 46:28.940
What did she tell you?

46:29.065 --> 46:32.982
It's my best friend's daughter.
You know that, don't you?

46:35.815 --> 46:39.482
Shit, it's Klara.
I have to talk to Theo.

46:43.315 --> 46:47.440
What are you doing here?
Why is Ulla in the office, crying?

46:47.565 --> 46:51.857
- You'd better leave now, Lucas.
- What the hell?

46:51.982 --> 46:55.565
We have nothing to say
to each other. Go.

46:55.648 --> 46:58.940
- Have you gone mad?
- I might have. Off you go.

47:02.565 --> 47:04.648
Go away, Lucas.

47:36.315 --> 47:37.898
Hi, Theo.

47:39.148 --> 47:41.065
I think we need to talk.

47:45.482 --> 47:46.898
Yes...

47:49.523 --> 47:52.940
Okay.
The others are asleep. Come on.

47:57.690 --> 48:00.482
Let me get a drink.

48:20.148 --> 48:23.482
I've made lemonade.

48:24.815 --> 48:27.773
If you're thirsty...

48:30.023 --> 48:31.398
Thanks.

48:31.523 --> 48:35.565
Now, listen...
We have to talk about this.

48:40.023 --> 48:41.482
Yes.

48:44.315 --> 48:46.315
What are they saying?

48:49.107 --> 48:54.565
You have to ask your daughter.
They don't tell me anything.

48:54.690 --> 48:57.857
It's blown out of all proportion.

49:00.148 --> 49:04.107
You and I have to sit down
and figure out what's happened,

49:04.232 --> 49:09.398
and then go to Grethe
before all hell breaks loose.

49:19.023 --> 49:23.315
You want me to ask Klara?
Is that what you want?

49:23.482 --> 49:26.815
Of course.
What do you mean?

49:28.023 --> 49:33.440
Lucas... I know my little girl.
She doesn't lie. She never did.

49:38.315 --> 49:40.273
Why would she be lying now?

49:44.440 --> 49:49.273
I don't know why, but she is.

50:00.148 --> 50:04.357
- Lucas, for fuck's sake.
- I didn't touch your daughter.

50:13.607 --> 50:15.898
You know that I didn't.

50:18.357 --> 50:21.898
Do you believe me or not?

50:25.232 --> 50:27.148
I don't know.

50:31.648 --> 50:37.023
- Theo, I didn't touch your daughter.
- I don't know, Lucas.

50:49.065 --> 50:54.732
- He's not supposed to be here.
- Probably not.

50:55.857 --> 50:59.148
- You must go now.
- What did I do?

50:59.315 --> 51:01.982
What is it you think I did?

51:02.107 --> 51:07.440
Shut up! Get out!
I don't want to talk to you!

51:07.565 --> 51:13.023
Bastard. Don't sit in our sofa.
I never want to see you again.

51:13.148 --> 51:16.107
I'll cut your dick off. Get out!

51:17.107 --> 51:19.107
Hey, Lucas...

51:20.315 --> 51:22.357
Are you insane?

51:22.482 --> 51:27.940
If you touched my daughter,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

51:28.065 --> 51:30.857
And I think you did,
because she says so.

51:32.773 --> 51:35.815
Do you want to ruin my life?
Do you?

51:35.940 --> 51:39.357
- Look at me!
- What are you doing?

51:41.190 --> 51:44.190
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi, Lucas.

51:44.315 --> 51:48.565
Klara, go to your room.
Agnes!

51:51.565 --> 51:53.815
Come, let's go to the living room.

51:57.107 --> 52:00.190
Is Dad sad?

52:00.315 --> 52:03.898
He'll cool down. You know that.

52:05.273 --> 52:09.982
- Let's sit here and wake up.
- Are you mad at Lucas?

52:13.440 --> 52:18.982
- Let's just sit here.
- He didn't do anything.

52:19.107 --> 52:25.773
I just said something foolish.
Now all the kids are talking.

52:35.523 --> 52:40.690
Honey...
It's difficult to understand.

52:40.815 --> 52:44.648
But perhaps it's like this.

52:46.690 --> 52:49.773
Your mind prefers not
to remember what happened.

52:49.898 --> 52:55.107
It's unpleasant to think about,
but, Klara, it did happen.

52:56.940 --> 53:00.440
And we're so happy
that you've told us.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.190
Right, honey?

53:09.315 --> 53:13.107
Come. Let's have some cookies.

53:22.107 --> 53:26.023
Hi, Nadja.
Please come in and sit down.

53:35.232 --> 53:41.440
You've probably heard about it.
We've reported the incident.

53:47.732 --> 53:51.065
We have informed the parents
about the symptoms of abuse,

53:51.190 --> 53:56.398
and they've asked their children
if they've had any nightmares...

53:59.232 --> 54:04.940
A number of parents
reported symptoms of abuse.

54:05.065 --> 54:07.148
So we had to act.

54:14.857 --> 54:17.982
Are you seeing Lucas?

54:48.107 --> 54:53.440
Lucas has walked Klara here.
They've been seen together.

54:54.732 --> 54:59.398
He's been alone with the children.
In the toilets and the soft play room.

55:00.690 --> 55:03.648
Kirsten, it's me again.
Please call me.

55:14.065 --> 55:15.690
She doesn't answer.

55:17.523 --> 55:20.648
Perhaps,
but I need to talk to Marcus.

55:28.940 --> 55:31.273
What did they say in nursery?

55:44.607 --> 55:47.690
- Hi, Klara.

55:53.107 --> 55:58.273
- What are you doing here?
- Can I walk Fanny?

55:59.857 --> 56:02.357
Okay. Of course.

56:05.232 --> 56:07.773
Does your mum know
you're here?

56:12.982 --> 56:16.065
You need to talk to your mum
before you come over.

56:22.607 --> 56:26.398
They say that
you did bad things to me.

56:38.773 --> 56:41.232
Do you believe that too?

56:43.315 --> 56:46.482
I don't know.
I don't really remember.

56:54.898 --> 57:01.023
- What did I do, sweetie?
- I don't remember anymore.

57:01.148 --> 57:03.523
It's also the others.

57:08.357 --> 57:11.190
Who are the others?

57:13.648 --> 57:16.607
Klara, who are they?

57:16.732 --> 57:18.523
I'm scared.

57:26.857 --> 57:29.315
Do you want to go home?

57:32.023 --> 57:37.315
- What about Fanny?
- You can walk her another day.

57:39.232 --> 57:41.148
You'd better go home now.

58:05.773 --> 58:07.440
What?

58:16.523 --> 58:18.398
What do you think?

58:30.898 --> 58:33.315
What do you mean?

58:39.732 --> 58:41.815
Do you think I'm insane?

58:46.607 --> 58:49.773
Do you think I'm insane?

59:00.398 --> 59:02.898
You'd better go. Get your things.

59:05.232 --> 59:08.440
Come... I want you to leave.

59:16.523 --> 59:22.232
I've harmed a child. Is that
what you're saying, you idiot?

59:22.357 --> 59:24.940
Get out. Out!

59:34.732 --> 59:39.898
- Look, it's snowing.
- Right on the elf.

59:40.023 --> 59:41.232
Yes.

59:47.565 --> 59:52.190
Let's put this one on the lake.

59:52.315 --> 59:55.565
Yes. They're skating.

59:57.857 --> 01:00:01.690
- Where's he going?
- You decide.

01:00:02.648 --> 01:00:04.107
Here.

01:00:07.773 --> 01:00:09.190
Yes.

01:00:12.107 --> 01:00:14.857
And this one up there...

01:00:16.982 --> 01:00:19.482
Then he can see everything.

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:29.898
Shouldn't he join the others?

01:00:32.023 --> 01:00:36.648
It's snowing!
Don't you want to see it?

01:00:36.773 --> 01:00:40.732
- I'm coming.
- It's so pretty!

01:00:44.773 --> 01:00:46.482
Don't get cold.

01:02:17.732 --> 01:02:20.565
What the hell?

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:21.982
Marcus?

01:02:24.565 --> 01:02:27.148
IS it you?

01:02:27.273 --> 01:02:30.982
- Sorry. Come here.
- You scared me.

01:02:31.065 --> 01:02:34.898
- I didn't mean to. Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:02:36.898 --> 01:02:39.440
Hi, Fanny, old girl.

01:02:43.357 --> 01:02:47.648
- Does Mum know you're here?
- Yes.

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:53.898
- Where the hell is the key?
- I gave it to someone.

01:02:55.732 --> 01:02:58.648
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

01:02:59.857 --> 01:03:04.315
- What a mess. It looks like shit.
- Come here...

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.023
Stop it already.

01:03:09.107 --> 01:03:13.232
Mum suggested that
I drop by to say hello.

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:16.315
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- Well...

01:03:17.023 --> 01:03:20.857
I took a couple of days off.

01:03:20.982 --> 01:03:25.648
You know that things
aren't normal around here.

01:03:25.773 --> 01:03:28.523
I've been fired.

01:03:28.648 --> 01:03:33.857
The police are involved,
but they tell me bugger all.

01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:38.148
I'm going crazy.

01:03:40.607 --> 01:03:43.148
Mum doesn't know you're here,
does she?

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:52.065
- Does she?
- Fuck, man.

01:03:53.273 --> 01:03:55.232
I'm crying again...

01:04:05.482 --> 01:04:09.190
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:18.357
- It's okay.
- I'll pull myself together.

01:04:18.482 --> 01:04:20.732
It's ridiculous, man.

01:04:33.732 --> 01:04:35.898
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:36.023 --> 01:04:40.148
Well, if it isn't my godson.
Hi, Marcus.

01:04:40.273 --> 01:04:43.898
- Hi.
- Do you have time to be here?

01:04:45.107 --> 01:04:48.565
- The air is a little dry in here.
- Coffee?

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:50.107
Yeah.

01:04:54.732 --> 01:04:59.523
Did you talk to the police?
What did they say?

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:05.315
They asked a bunch of questions.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.315
Evidently,
I've touched other kids as well.

01:05:09.815 --> 01:05:12.357
- It's insane.
- Completely.

01:05:13.607 --> 01:05:17.065
What? Bloody hell,
you didn't do anything!

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:23.315
It's all of them now.
It's Johan, it's Bent...

01:05:24.648 --> 01:05:27.148
They've gone raving mad.

01:05:30.482 --> 01:05:34.898
You've always put up with too much.
I've told you before.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:42.107
Alright, Fanny. Kirsten!

01:05:42.232 --> 01:05:44.273
Yes. Still got it!

01:05:49.023 --> 01:05:51.273
I don't know...

01:05:55.690 --> 01:06:00.773
Thanks. It'll be alright.
Marcus is here now...

01:06:00.898 --> 01:06:04.523
Neglecting to pour
his godfather a cup of coffee.

01:06:04.648 --> 01:06:08.232
- What about your hunting licence?
- October 16th.

01:06:08.357 --> 01:06:12.648
The day when men become mice,
and mice become men.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.523
Call Mum and say you're here.

01:06:22.648 --> 01:06:26.773
And Marcus? If she flares up,
I'll put her in her place.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:53.898
- That'|| be 269.50.
- Here you go.

01:06:57.565 --> 01:07:00.898
- Thank you. Here's 30.50.
- Thanks.

01:07:03.482 --> 01:07:09.648
- Hi, Marcus. ls your dad with you?
- No.

01:07:09.773 --> 01:07:14.357
Tell him that neither of you
are welcome here anymore.

01:07:16.898 --> 01:07:20.857
- Why?
- We have other customers.

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:24.023
You're not welcome.

01:07:46.023 --> 01:07:49.523
- What's going on?
- Is that your son?

01:07:55.065 --> 01:07:59.648
Can I...? Call Mum and tell her
to pick you up.

01:07:59.773 --> 01:08:03.482
I've been arrested. I need to go.
Are you okay?

01:08:04.898 --> 01:08:08.982
Jump in. The opposite seat.

01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:25.439
Fuck, man!

01:08:45.857 --> 01:08:49.689
- Hi, Marcus.
- Do you have a key to our house?

01:08:55.648 --> 01:08:59.523
A key? I don't think so.

01:08:59.607 --> 01:09:02.898
- I'm off, then.
- Marcus, are you okay?

01:09:04.898 --> 01:09:08.273
- Yes.
- Listen...

01:09:09.107 --> 01:09:13.773
We know they picked up your dad.

01:09:17.732 --> 01:09:23.148
Can I have a word with you?
Can I have a word?

01:09:24.023 --> 01:09:25.773
Yes, but we...

01:09:28.482 --> 01:09:31.689
Come on in. Are you hungry?

01:09:32.857 --> 01:09:37.982
Go and say hello to Marcus.
Klara, can you find the mugs?

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:41.773
- Hi, Marcus.
- Hi.

01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:48.939
Well... See you.

01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:54.773
Hi! He's sat in there...

01:10:08.898 --> 01:10:11.898
We can give you a lift.

01:10:12.565 --> 01:10:15.148
Or call your mum.

01:10:23.232 --> 01:10:27.482
Marcus, are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:10:31.232 --> 01:10:34.898
I just wanted to ask
if you'd help my dad?

01:10:35.023 --> 01:10:39.357
Help your dad? How?

01:10:39.523 --> 01:10:42.398
Could you think it
all through again?

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:49.190
You're such a good boy,
and I understand your feelings.

01:10:49.315 --> 01:10:52.357
You shouldn't pay
for his mistakes.

01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:54.857
But he hasn't done
what you say.

01:10:56.982 --> 01:11:01.815
- Honey, go to your room.
- I want to tell her something.

01:11:02.773 --> 01:11:04.607
- Hi, Klara.

01:11:06.148 --> 01:11:08.023
Are you doing all right?

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.607
- Why are you lying about my dad?
- I'm not.

01:11:14.732 --> 01:11:20.148
- Let's go, Klara.
- I just want to talk...

01:11:20.273 --> 01:11:22.982
- L811 gQ!
- Stop it!

01:11:23.107 --> 01:11:28.190
- Don't touch her.
- You're out of here.

01:11:28.315 --> 01:11:31.523
- I've had it with you.
- I just want to talk to her.

01:11:31.648 --> 01:11:36.315
- Why do you lie about my dad, bitch?
- Oh no, you didn't!

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.232
- Get him out of here.
- I want to talk to her!

01:11:41.357 --> 01:11:42.815
Enough already.

01:11:44.148 --> 01:11:46.315
What the hell?

01:11:47.232 --> 01:11:51.648
Johan, for fuck's sake! Stop it!

01:11:51.773 --> 01:11:56.523
Stop it. Get away from him!

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.440
Get up and go home.

01:12:01.565 --> 01:12:05.440
- Go home.
- Fucking assholes!

01:12:05.565 --> 01:12:07.565
Come on.

01:12:10.898 --> 01:12:12.398
Fucking assholes!

01:12:28.273 --> 01:12:31.607
Hi, Marcus. Good to see you.
Come on.

01:12:31.732 --> 01:12:34.565
You're exhausted.

01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:44.690
- Did someone hit you?
- No.

01:12:50.398 --> 01:12:53.440
Young ladies, keep it down.

01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:57.315
Some relatives are staying over.

01:12:59.523 --> 01:13:01.773
Come on, Marcus.

01:13:01.898 --> 01:13:05.815
My two sisters.
You met them when you were a child.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:11.648
- I haven't seen you for a long time.
- We call them Chip and Dale.

01:13:11.773 --> 01:13:16.982
They're cracking nuts.
My old man is helping your dad.

01:13:21.107 --> 01:13:26.232
This is Lucas' boy, Marcus.
Elias and Erik. My brothers in law.

01:13:28.732 --> 01:13:31.607
I'm Erik. This bastard is Elias.

01:13:31.732 --> 01:13:37.315
- Sit down. Get him some water.
- Are you thirsty?

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:43.940
- Is tap water okay?
- Thanks.

01:13:44.065 --> 01:13:47.023
I've spoken to your mum.

01:13:47.148 --> 01:13:50.148
Remember to phone home.
Agreed?

01:13:54.523 --> 01:13:56.732
Do you know
what's happening to Dad?

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.190
What did dad say?

01:14:05.315 --> 01:14:11.607
He said that Lucas has
a preliminary hearing tomorrow.

01:14:11.732 --> 01:14:15.315
At 8:30am.
There are two possible outcomes.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.107
Either the judge
confirms the remand.

01:14:20.232 --> 01:14:25.565
Or he finds no basis
for keeping him.

01:14:29.982 --> 01:14:32.607
What do you think will happen?

01:14:35.398 --> 01:14:37.232
I don't know.

01:14:38.232 --> 01:14:43.315
Apparently, all the children
are telling the same story.

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:51.232
They describe your basement,
the wallpaper, the colour of the sofa.

01:14:52.732 --> 01:14:56.065
But when the police searched
your house this morning,

01:14:57.482 --> 01:14:59.523
they discovered what, Marcus?

01:15:04.732 --> 01:15:07.940
- That we don't have a basement.
- Exactly.

01:15:09.190 --> 01:15:13.065
- What does that mean?
- That they don't have a basement!

01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:18.690
- What does it mean for Lucas?
- It means there's still hope.

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:25.190
It's common for children
to describe non-existing details.

01:15:25.315 --> 01:15:29.357
I don't know
if it's their imagination,

01:15:29.482 --> 01:15:33.523
or they pick it up from each other
or from their parents.

01:15:33.648 --> 01:15:36.732
It's always assumed
that children tell the truth.

01:15:38.398 --> 01:15:41.065
And unfortunately,
very often they do.

01:15:44.148 --> 01:15:49.065
- Now what?
- We'll have to wait and see.

01:15:50.523 --> 01:15:53.815
They'll call us tomorrow.

01:17:05.357 --> 01:17:07.732
Good morning, lad.

01:17:10.773 --> 01:17:12.565
Sleep well?

01:17:14.148 --> 01:17:16.815
I've brought you bread,
cheese and coffee.

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.232
Thanks.

01:17:19.607 --> 01:17:22.482
I need to talk to you.

01:17:24.190 --> 01:17:29.732
I'm your godfather,
and you can count on me.

01:17:32.023 --> 01:17:34.565
No matter what happens. Okay?

01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:43.357
I've just spoken to your dad.
It looks good.

01:17:43.482 --> 01:17:46.732
- He's on his way in a taxi.
- What?

01:17:46.857 --> 01:17:48.815
They let him go.

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.940
Eat your bread
and drink your coffee.

01:17:52.065 --> 01:17:57.023
Then we'll go downstairs
and welcome your dad.

01:18:22.315 --> 01:18:27.148
Hey! If you fondle your kid,
you'll go back to jail.

01:18:27.273 --> 01:18:29.982
We've got bacon and eggs.
It won't eat itself.

01:18:30.107 --> 01:18:33.273
- Come on.
- It's good to see you.

01:18:35.315 --> 01:18:38.023
Fanny! Hi, Fanny-girl.

01:18:38.148 --> 01:18:44.440
It's not too messy. You two,
grab a shovel and dig a basement.

01:18:44.565 --> 01:18:49.190
- Fanny has peed on the floor.
- No. It's probably the police.

01:19:19.565 --> 01:19:23.023
- Fanny!
- She'll be here in a minute.

01:19:31.107 --> 01:19:34.773
Do you want me to wash
the knickers I found?

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:42.815
- Do you?
- What's your point?

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:47.148
Nothing. I just asked
if you want them washed.

01:19:47.273 --> 01:19:50.940
- Yes, if you can find them.
- I will, in a minute.

01:19:52.273 --> 01:19:56.523
If you put them in the wash.
Are you seeing each other?

01:19:56.648 --> 01:19:59.232
I thought so.
Then all this happened.

01:20:02.357 --> 01:20:05.232
I wanted you to meet her,
but we'll see.

01:20:08.357 --> 01:20:13.523
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, it's not my thing.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:18.898
- Having a girlfriend?
- No.

01:20:22.648 --> 01:20:26.648
- I remember Jasmin.
- That's more than a year ago.

01:20:36.148 --> 01:20:39.065
Stay down. Don't move.

01:20:50.148 --> 01:20:52.357
Hello!

01:21:00.148 --> 01:21:01.565
Hello!

01:21:41.398 --> 01:21:43.315
What's that?

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.940
- Dad, what is it?
- Go back in, Marcus.

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.232
Let's go back in.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:59.023
- Come on in.
- Forget it, man.

01:22:23.815 --> 01:22:27.898
- You're dead!
- Stop it.

01:22:28.023 --> 01:22:31.398
- Relax...
- Fucking dead! Let go of me!

01:22:31.523 --> 01:22:34.440
- Stop it!
- I'll kill you!

01:22:37.898 --> 01:22:42.065
I'll kill you!
Bring her in. She's cold.

01:22:56.732 --> 01:22:58.190
Lucas?

01:23:08.648 --> 01:23:11.482
I'd like to be alone.

01:23:11.607 --> 01:23:13.690
Where's Marcus?

01:23:16.273 --> 01:23:19.523
- You sent him back to his mum?
- Yes.

01:23:23.315 --> 01:23:28.857
- Please leave, Bruun.
- Come on in.

01:23:28.982 --> 01:23:31.607
Go home, when I tell you to!

01:23:33.648 --> 01:23:35.398
Just go.

01:24:17.315 --> 01:24:20.857
- Here you go. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Per.

01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:27.148
- I'd like two chops.
- We don't have chops.

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:34.732
- Sorry, I mean those pork chops.
- You can't buy anything here.

01:24:43.523 --> 01:24:46.607
- I have a right to shop here.
- I want you to leave.

01:24:47.773 --> 01:24:52.273
- You need to leave. Scram.
- I want two chops.

01:25:06.065 --> 01:25:10.065
Off you go.
Don't come here.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:21.440
- You're not welcome.
- You can't hit a person like that.

01:25:21.565 --> 01:25:24.648
You have to leave now.

01:25:26.107 --> 01:25:29.107
- Is it normal to hit someone like that?
- Get out.

01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:31.690
I can walk!

01:25:37.857 --> 01:25:42.190
- I need my stuff.
- Get out! Now!

01:25:47.107 --> 01:25:51.857
- Get him out.
- Not a moment too soon.

01:25:52.023 --> 01:25:55.273
Get out!

01:25:55.398 --> 01:25:58.148
Thank you for coming.

01:26:00.857 --> 01:26:04.232
Get lost.

01:26:04.357 --> 01:26:07.482
Bugger off.
Don't come here ever again.

01:26:08.523 --> 01:26:10.273
Stay away.

01:27:01.857 --> 01:27:06.940
Didn't I tell you to get lost?
I won't tell you again.

01:27:08.732 --> 01:27:11.190
I just want to say something.

01:27:14.815 --> 01:27:19.357
- Fuck! Shit, that hurts.
- What the hell?

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:24.857
- Can I have my things, please?
- Just give him his groceries.

01:27:30.065 --> 01:27:32.815
Fucking hell.

01:27:36.273 --> 01:27:38.607
That's 45.50.

01:27:49.065 --> 01:27:51.815
Good God, it's Lucas.

01:27:51.898 --> 01:27:54.398
Look at him. He's a mess.

01:27:59.982 --> 01:28:04.982
- I'll go and speak to him.
- Let's stay here until he's gone.

01:28:11.315 --> 01:28:13.357
Where's Fanny?

01:28:17.732 --> 01:28:19.648
I don't know.

01:28:21.523 --> 01:28:23.190
Shit...

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:58.398
CHRISTMAS EVE

01:31:00.232 --> 01:31:02.815
I'd like to go in.

01:31:43.732 --> 01:31:48.523
A warm welcome to you all.
And merry Christmas.

01:31:48.648 --> 01:31:52.982
This is our Christmas service.

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:56.523
As always,
we'll open with a prayer.

01:32:03.315 --> 01:32:07.523
I have come into this your house
to hear what you say to me,

01:32:07.648 --> 01:32:11.065
God the Father, you, Lord Jesus,

01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:15.982
good Holy Spirit,
in life and death my comforter.

01:32:16.815 --> 01:32:22.190
Open my heart by your Holy Spirit,
for the sake of Jesus Christ.

01:32:22.315 --> 01:32:27.482
So that I may learn to repent my sins
and to believe in Jesus,

01:32:27.607 --> 01:32:32.065
and every day
to grow in holy life and living.

01:32:32.190 --> 01:32:37.232
Hear me and grant this, O God,
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

01:32:43.482 --> 01:32:48.523
Christmas Eve is about Baby Jesus.

01:32:48.690 --> 01:32:51.732
The son of God is born.

01:32:51.857 --> 01:32:55.982
- What's wrong?
- I can tell by looking at him.

01:32:57.523 --> 01:32:59.357
Tell what?

01:33:00.982 --> 01:33:06.398
We should think about it
during the Lord's Prayer.

01:33:07.565 --> 01:33:13.982
Father, you say. And then it happens.
You have become a child of God.

01:33:15.315 --> 01:33:21.523
It is starting now.
Christmas time is a time for children.

01:33:22.648 --> 01:33:26.940
This year we want to emphasize
the gospel for Christmas Day.

01:33:27.065 --> 01:33:32.023
We've invited the nursery choir
who have been practising,

01:33:32.148 --> 01:33:37.773
so we may enjoy the hymn
"A Child is Born in Bethlehem".

01:33:44.982 --> 01:33:47.940
Come on, stand over here.

01:33:55.190 --> 01:33:57.815
Klara, you stand here.

01:34:00.148 --> 01:34:02.065
Take a step forward.

01:35:19.982 --> 01:35:24.107
What are you saying?

01:35:24.232 --> 01:35:28.773
- Have you got something to say to me?
- Stop it, Lucas.

01:35:28.898 --> 01:35:32.690
- You want to tell me something?
- Relax, Lucas!

01:35:32.815 --> 01:35:36.898
The whole town is listening.
Tell me!

01:35:37.023 --> 01:35:42.648
- You psycho!
- What do you want to say?

01:35:47.065 --> 01:35:52.107
- Stop it, you fucking psychopath!
- I want a word with Theo.

01:35:52.232 --> 01:35:57.482
Look into my eyes.
Look me in the eyes.

01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:03.732
What do you see?
Do you see anything?

01:36:05.065 --> 01:36:09.023
Nothing. There's nothing.

01:36:10.523 --> 01:36:12.065
There's nothing.

01:36:13.773 --> 01:36:15.898
You leave me alone now.

01:36:17.023 --> 01:36:22.065
Leave me alone now, Theo.
Then I'll go. Thank you.

01:36:48.482 --> 01:36:53.815
- You're the lucky one.
- You've had enough presents.

01:36:55.065 --> 01:36:58.315
It's exactly what you wished for.

01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.482
I've got her.

01:37:35.982 --> 01:37:37.773
Fanny...

01:37:51.482 --> 01:37:56.190
Lucas... Hi, Lucas.

01:38:06.648 --> 01:38:09.815
It was not supposed to happen.

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.607
Klara, honey...

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:30.815
It's not Lucas. It's just Dad.

01:38:39.273 --> 01:38:41.898
- Dad, are you crying?
- No.

01:38:43.648 --> 01:38:49.107
The world is full of evil.

01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:54.607
But if we hold on to each other,
it goes away.

01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:58.773
Are you really sad?

01:39:03.357 --> 01:39:05.148
No.

01:39:06.357 --> 01:39:08.940
You know,

01:39:09.065 --> 01:39:14.732
that Lucas is my very best friend.

01:39:14.857 --> 01:39:20.273
We rode our mopeds...

01:39:20.398 --> 01:39:23.482
We stole apples and all that.
I've told you before.

01:39:25.398 --> 01:39:28.273
I just said something foolish.

01:39:31.232 --> 01:39:33.440
He didn't do anything.

01:39:41.773 --> 01:39:44.982
- No.
- No.

01:39:48.398 --> 01:39:50.773
Go to sleep.

01:40:08.273 --> 01:40:11.815
- What are you doing?
- Just go join the others.

01:40:14.607 --> 01:40:16.607
Who's that for?

01:40:17.773 --> 01:40:21.523
Give me ten minutes,
and I'll be back.

01:40:22.982 --> 01:40:27.148
Theo.
You're not going to his place.

01:40:29.898 --> 01:40:33.857
Agnes, step aside.

01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:03.357
- Hey. Lucas...
- What are you doing here?

01:41:03.482 --> 01:41:05.190
It's just me.

01:41:12.023 --> 01:41:14.523
What the hell are you doing here?

01:41:22.315 --> 01:41:25.398
I brought you some food,
in case...

01:41:30.607 --> 01:41:32.690
Are you hungry?

01:41:39.565 --> 01:41:42.773
Go ahead and eat, if you want.

01:42:47.648 --> 01:42:52.482
It's very nice.
You can just go home, if you like.

01:42:59.690 --> 01:43:01.190
No...

01:43:02.773 --> 01:43:06.398
Actually,
I'd like to stay for a while.

01:43:06.523 --> 01:43:08.315
If it's okay.

01:44:07.982 --> 01:44:12.440
ONE YEAR LATER

01:44:35.773 --> 01:44:37.857
- Ready?
- Yes.

01:44:41.523 --> 01:44:43.273
- Hi, Johan.
- Hello.

01:44:50.315 --> 01:44:52.648
Hi, Dan. So we're back.

01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:55.357
Lucas!

01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:00.898
- Good to see you.
- You too.

01:45:05.523 --> 01:45:11.482
Quiet! Shut up.
We're gathered here for a reason.

01:45:12.273 --> 01:45:16.232
This is the day
when boys become men,

01:45:16.357 --> 01:45:18.440
and men become boys.

01:45:18.565 --> 01:45:23.315
Marcus, old boy.
You have your hunting licence.

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.357
And it's your turn
tomorrow at the crack of dawn.

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:31.398
You're becoming an adult.

01:45:31.523 --> 01:45:34.732
You're about to conquer the forest.

01:45:34.857 --> 01:45:36.773
Come here, my boy.

01:45:46.523 --> 01:45:49.940
It's a great pleasure
to see you here.

01:45:51.482 --> 01:45:53.982
This is for you.

01:46:08.815 --> 01:46:11.815
I wish you were my boy,

01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:15.982
and that this was
a present from me.

01:46:16.065 --> 01:46:22.398
But it's not from me.
It's from your father.

01:46:22.523 --> 01:46:25.898
It's been in your family
for generations,

01:46:26.023 --> 01:46:29.398
and now...it's yours.

01:46:30.607 --> 01:46:32.232
Take care of it.

01:46:32.357 --> 01:46:37.357
Your grandfather missed
many deer

01:46:37.482 --> 01:46:39.773
in order to feed your family.

01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:43.523
Don't forget that.
Congratulations!

01:46:44.815 --> 01:46:49.065
<i>We hope that he will drink with us,
and drink with us, and drink with us!</i>

01:46:49.190 --> 01:46:53.232
<i>We hope that he will drink with us,
that he will drink with us!</i>

01:46:53.357 --> 01:46:58.398
<i>That he will drink with us!</i>

01:46:58.523 --> 01:46:59.940
Cheers and congratulations!

01:47:00.065 --> 01:47:02.523
Lunch is served!

01:47:07.523 --> 01:47:11.107
- Do you have any more?
- We'll bring it in.

01:47:30.648 --> 01:47:35.482
That's tricky. Look at all
those lines you can't step on.

01:47:35.607 --> 01:47:38.357
Yes, I was just
thinking the same.

01:47:41.107 --> 01:47:43.482
- Hi, Klara.

01:47:45.107 --> 01:47:46.940
Are you okay?

01:47:59.357 --> 01:48:04.982
- How do we get around those lines?
- I don't know. There are so many.

01:48:05.107 --> 01:48:06.732
Yes.

01:48:15.232 --> 01:48:16.440
Come.

01:48:22.857 --> 01:48:24.273
Careful now.

01:48:25.607 --> 01:48:29.648
Very long steps...

01:48:30.565 --> 01:48:34.440
We made it.
I think your dad is in there.

01:48:37.648 --> 01:48:39.482
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:48:56.607 --> 01:49:01.357
- You're scaring the deer.
- What am I doing?

01:49:03.773 --> 01:49:07.148
- Did I ruin everything?
- No, it'll be back.

01:49:07.857 --> 01:49:13.523
Marcus. Go wait by your deer stand.
You'll wait a while but they'll come.

01:49:15.523 --> 01:49:17.440
Are you ready?
