00:41.400 --> 00:46.166
(mellow music playing)

00:57.567 --> 00:59.166
Well, hi, Blanche.

01:00.533 --> 01:01.767
What's the matter?

01:01.834 --> 01:07.033
You know that attorney I've been dating?
I caught him handling melons at the A&amp;P.

01:08.567 --> 01:10.400
And I take it they weren't yours.

01:13.300 --> 01:16.500
You missed my point.
He told me he was a lawyer.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.600
It turns out he's a fruit waxer.

01:20.567 --> 01:23.000
Why do men have to put up false pretenses?

01:23.066 --> 01:26.400
You wear more chest padding
than Johnny Bench.

01:28.367 --> 01:32.166
I can't take time for breakfast.
I'm late. See you later.

01:32.233 --> 01:36.600
-Rose, aren't you forgetting something?
-Oh.

01:38.867 --> 01:43.467
-Sorry, Mama.
-Rose, it's me, Dorothy.

01:43.533 --> 01:46.834
-Oh.
-Didn't you sleep again last night?

01:46.900 --> 01:49.900
No. It's been three nights in a row.

01:49.967 --> 01:52.633
Have you tried drinking warm milk
before bed?

01:52.700 --> 01:56.700
I can't. It reminds me
of when cousin Enoch

01:56.767 --> 01:59.033
fell into the vat of milk at the dairy.

02:00.166 --> 02:02.233
Goodness, was he hurt?

02:02.300 --> 02:03.533
Oh, no.

02:03.900 --> 02:08.834
In fact, it began the annual tradition
of the St. Olaf milk diving tournament.

02:09.734 --> 02:12.467
I won three times in the low-fat division.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.800
Eventually, they discontinued the event.

02:15.867 --> 02:19.033
Several spectators were caught
dipping their Oreo cookies

02:19.100 --> 02:20.633
in the winner's swim trunks.

02:23.433 --> 02:24.567
-(doorbell rings)
-I'll get it!

02:24.633 --> 02:26.000
-I'll get it!
-I'll get it!

02:27.600 --> 02:31.934
-Why not take a sleeping pill?
-I don't like pills.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.633
I get slaphappy and say silly things.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.533
We certainly wouldn't want that to happen.

02:39.467 --> 02:41.600
-Hi. It's me, Stan.
-What do you want?

02:44.233 --> 02:45.834
I have a surprise for Dorothy.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.700
What, now that you're off blood pressure
medicine, it's working again?

02:52.567 --> 02:56.500
My God, Sophia, is there anything Dorothy
didn't tell you about us?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.967
Actually, yes, I didn't
know she was pregnant

02:59.033 --> 03:00.767
until four days after the wedding.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.533
Hi, Sophia.
Remember me, Stan's brother, Ted?

03:05.600 --> 03:08.266
-We danced at their wedding.
-Where were you when they divorced?

03:08.333 --> 03:10.033
I was looking to dance then.

03:12.633 --> 03:16.967
-Ted, what a surprise!
-It's great to see you again.

03:17.033 --> 03:19.667
-And me?
-Go hug a land mine.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.500
Blanche, Rose, this is
my little brother Ted.

03:25.567 --> 03:28.767
Charmed, I'm sure.
There's my new <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

03:29.433 --> 03:32.967
-He's just in from Minneapolis.
-Minneapolis, Minnesota?

03:33.033 --> 03:34.900
No, Rose. Minneapolis, France.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.033
-Oh, I'm from Minnesota.
-I'm from Minnesota too.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.834
Then you just moved to France?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.300
Welcome to my life.

03:46.834 --> 03:49.467
Nice meeting you.
I have to go to work.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.600
-What do you do?
-She's Gary Hart's campaign manager.

03:59.467 --> 04:02.600
It doesn't pay much, but you don't have
to get out of bed to do it.

04:09.266 --> 04:11.066
Oh, right. I better change.

04:11.867 --> 04:14.867
Ted, what brings you to Miami?

04:14.934 --> 04:18.533
I'm spending some time
with the greatest guy in the world.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.533
He still looks up to me.

04:20.900 --> 04:25.500
He should. Ted's just a doctor
and a pillar of his community,

04:25.567 --> 04:29.200
while you were the king
of padded toilet seats.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.700
They sold real well,
even put our daughter through college.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.900
They got me through
some tough times too.

04:46.133 --> 04:49.533
Did I hear someone
say you were a doctor?

04:49.600 --> 04:51.100
Not just a doctor...

04:51.467 --> 04:54.200
one of the top neurosurgeons
in the Midwest.

04:54.266 --> 04:56.800
-Get out of here.
-He's also heavy into real estate.

04:56.867 --> 05:02.567
-Nothing much. Just a few mini-malls.
-Your wife must be very proud of you.

05:02.633 --> 05:07.233
-Actually, we're divorced.
-Oh, I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.233
Love your shirt.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.667
Nice segue, Blanche.

05:25.166 --> 05:27.266
You know, I've never
met a neurosurgeon before.

05:27.333 --> 05:30.934
I would love to hear more about your work,
how about 8 tonight?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.300
Well, that sounds good but I think Stan
might have something planned for us.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.300
Well, I did have ringside seats
at the mud wrestling palace but

05:37.367 --> 05:39.767
hey, a bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.934
Elegantly put, Stan.

05:43.133 --> 05:45.867
-Well, I guess we're on.
-Well, we better get going, Ted.

05:46.233 --> 05:48.166
We wanna get a parking space
at the nude beach

05:48.233 --> 05:49.600
before all those perverts show up.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.834
-See you tonight, doctor.
-Huh-huh.

05:56.433 --> 05:59.033
Well, that was pretty embarrassing.

05:59.100 --> 06:03.200
I know, Dorothy, but what could I do?
He just practically threw himself at me.

06:05.367 --> 06:11.200
(serene music playing)

06:11.800 --> 06:15.266
-Well, good night, Blanche.
-What's your hurry?

06:15.333 --> 06:18.000
-I don't want to put you out.
-I like to put out.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.300
I mean, it's no trouble.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.166
Sit down.

06:31.700 --> 06:37.233
Being a doctor, it must be deeply
fulfilling to lay your hands on someone

06:37.300 --> 06:40.300
and bring them back
to full, pulsating vitality.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.600
Well, I've always believed
the body cures itself.

06:43.667 --> 06:48.000
-Doctors just help it along.
-I'm starting to feel hot.

06:48.066 --> 06:50.000
What could be causing that?

06:50.867 --> 06:52.433
Have you checked your thermostat?

06:54.100 --> 06:57.200
-Why don't you check it?
-Ok. Where is it?

06:58.400 --> 07:01.633
You spent nine years in med school.
Find it yourself.

07:03.967 --> 07:06.734
Hi, Blanche.
Hi, Ted. How was your date?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.000
It's not over yet.

07:11.533 --> 07:14.667
-What are you doing up?
-I still can't sleep.

07:14.734 --> 07:18.934
I don't want to seem insensitive,
but that's your problem. Get out.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.333
Well, Blanche, that does
seem a little insensitive.

07:27.066 --> 07:30.533
-No, it's not. You're just tired.
-Oh, okay.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.834
I'm sorry I interrupted.

07:32.900 --> 07:36.300
-Uh... that's ok. I better be going.
-You just stay right where you are.

07:36.367 --> 07:40.834
-Rose, go to bed.
-I can't sleep.

07:40.900 --> 07:44.734
-Try counting sheep.
-I can't. I'm allergic to wool.

07:45.934 --> 07:48.734
I got to 23 and broke out in hives.

07:49.233 --> 07:52.166
Then I started counting
members of the Jackson family.

07:52.533 --> 07:55.867
-Michael, Janet, Latoya, Tito--
-Rose!

07:55.934 --> 08:00.233
Then there's Stonewall Jackson, but I
don't remember him on the Victory Tour.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.834
Blanche, I'd better be going now.

08:03.900 --> 08:08.200
Ok. Before you do,
I want to thank you for a lovely evening.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.867
Oh, I guess he bought dinner.

08:14.066 --> 08:17.700
-Sophia!
<i>-The Best of Carson </i>is on.

08:17.767 --> 08:19.934
-In here?
-In Hollywood.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.700
They pipe it through little wires,
and it comes here.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.433
Uh... I really have to say good night now.

08:28.867 --> 08:31.767
-Thanks for everything.
-Why? You didn't get everything.

08:38.734 --> 08:40.533
-Hi, Ted.
-Hi, Dorothy.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.000
How was your date?

08:42.066 --> 08:47.066
When I was dating,
the man used to make all the moves.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.867
How many men have you dated?

08:51.433 --> 08:56.100
I don't think that's old-fashioned.
I think it's kind of nice.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.533
-How did you spend your evening?
-Parent-teacher meetings.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.734
Five hours of saying things like,
"Well, your little Betty is a joy

09:03.800 --> 09:05.967
but she's gonna have to trim her Mohawk

09:06.033 --> 09:08.500
if she wants to play Mary
in the Christmas play."

09:10.133 --> 09:13.433
-Sounds like you need to unwind.
-I think I need to retire.

09:14.266 --> 09:16.934
I know it's late,
but could we go for a drink?

09:17.300 --> 09:19.834
Sure. Yeah, I'll settle for that.

09:20.200 --> 09:23.967
(calm music playing)

09:26.800 --> 09:30.033
Four nights in a row
and I still can't sleep.

09:30.433 --> 09:33.066
Please, I haven't had a decent
night's sleep since I was 70

09:33.967 --> 09:36.767
I shouldn't complain,
I mean four nights is nothing

09:36.834 --> 09:39.767
compared to Elsie Uderuden
back in St. Olie.

09:41.467 --> 09:46.166
She stayed awake for 17 straight days
in a rocking chair marathon.

09:46.667 --> 09:49.400
Of course, she couldn't have done it
without the moral support of her children.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.467
And her husband. And his cattle prod.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.600
Okay, that's it. Drink this.

09:56.667 --> 10:00.567
It's a secret potion from the old country
guaranteed to put you to sleep.

10:01.233 --> 10:05.633
-Looks like milk.
-Trust me, Rose. Drink it, slowly.

10:06.133 --> 10:08.000
That's right, down the hatch.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.166
We call this Sicilian Sominex.

10:15.133 --> 10:17.200
Now, you might feel a slight tingling.

10:17.266 --> 10:20.467
But believe me,
you'll sleep like a baby.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.400
I don't feel any tingling,
when's it gonna hit me?

10:26.867 --> 10:28.166
Sophia!

10:36.166 --> 10:37.367
What are you doing?

10:38.200 --> 10:40.800
I was making a soufflé
and it got away from me.

10:44.867 --> 10:45.900
Good morning.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.834
That back door was open.
Any idiot could walk in.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.033
Any idiot did.

10:53.233 --> 10:56.633
So, Blanche, va-va-vavoom, huh?

10:57.266 --> 10:58.500
What?

10:58.567 --> 11:02.567
Last night with Ted. Cha-cha-cha.
Tango, tango. Ole, ole.

11:03.266 --> 11:05.633
Nobody here speaks Spanish, Stan.

11:07.367 --> 11:11.266
-What are you talking about?
-I can play dumb.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.433
Play? You could manage the team.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.333
Tell me where Ted is.
Is he still asleep?

11:19.400 --> 11:21.066
It's not what you think.

11:21.133 --> 11:23.700
I read you. Mum's the word.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.633
He's in the shower, right?

11:26.300 --> 11:27.567
Yo! Ted!

11:30.100 --> 11:33.000
-Stanley, your brother isn't here.
-Where is he?

11:33.066 --> 11:36.200
How should I know?
He left around 11:30.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.900
-That doesn't make sense.
-You're telling me.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.200
This is strange.

11:42.266 --> 11:45.066
He didn't call. He didn't come home.
It's not like Ted.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.233
I've got to find him.
He could've gotten mugged.

11:48.300 --> 11:51.133
He could be lying in the gutter bleeding.

11:57.567 --> 11:58.867
It's worse than I thought.

12:04.967 --> 12:09.400
(mellow music playing)

12:09.967 --> 12:11.867
What are you doing with my brother?

12:11.934 --> 12:15.033
Calm down, Stanley.
It's just a routine search.

12:17.567 --> 12:21.934
-I can't believe you're so desperate.
-Don't talk to me.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.166
I was talking to Ted.

12:24.734 --> 12:27.533
-Let's go!
-I'm not a child.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.967
-I'll go when I'm ready.
-Good for you, Ted.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.700
Ok. I'm ready.

12:34.266 --> 12:35.800
I'll call you later.

12:39.367 --> 12:43.100
-I can't believe what just happened.
-You owe me an explanation.

12:43.533 --> 12:47.333
-Well, Ted and I--
-I don't have to listen to this!

12:51.800 --> 12:53.800
-Don't give me that look.
-What look?

12:54.200 --> 12:57.934
I didn't do anything wrong.
Ted and I just talked.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.266
Right, and the <i>Godfather</i>
made all his money selling olive oil.

13:06.500 --> 13:11.200
If I thought there was anything
between you and Ted,

13:11.266 --> 13:15.000
-I never would have done what I did.
-What did you do, Dorothy?

13:16.433 --> 13:18.200
She spent the night with Ted.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.533
But Ted was your date.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.033
Dorothy, you must've slept
with somebody else.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.433
Blanche, I didn't steal your date.

13:30.500 --> 13:36.433
-Ted said you two had nothing in common.
-Well, obviously. He's dull, boring,

13:36.500 --> 13:39.367
and has dubious taste to say the least.

13:41.133 --> 13:43.967
If that's some schoolgirl attempt
to get my goat,

13:44.033 --> 13:45.266
you're wasting your breath.

13:45.333 --> 13:49.066
I'm questioning how any man could choose
you over me.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.066
It's not working, Blanche.

13:52.967 --> 13:55.066
I suppose there could be some
exceptions...

13:55.133 --> 13:58.400
convicts who haven't
seen a woman in 25 years.

14:00.166 --> 14:03.033
It's still not working, you bimbo.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.967
How childish to resort to name-calling,
you jezebel.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.433
-Floozy.
-Tramp!

14:14.400 --> 14:17.000
I am a tramp?

14:17.433 --> 14:19.767
Have you heard the latest ad campaigns?

14:20.133 --> 14:23.333
Join the Navy. See the world.
Sleep with Blanche Devereaux.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.667
Join the army. Be all you can be.
Sleep with Blanche Devereaux.

14:32.066 --> 14:34.400
The marines are looking
for a few good men

14:34.467 --> 14:36.700
who have not slept
with Blanche Devereaux.

14:45.133 --> 14:47.266
Just what are you trying to imply?

14:50.033 --> 14:51.567
-Slut!
-Trash!

14:52.233 --> 14:55.900
Now, girls, settle down before you say
something you'll both regret.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.300
She cannot stand
to see anyone else happy.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.467
Calm down, Dorothy.
I'll brew you some tea.

15:06.533 --> 15:07.734
I don't want any.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.467
This is a special blend, very soothing.

15:13.433 --> 15:15.300
Have you been drinking much of this?

15:15.367 --> 15:20.433
-Only when I can't sleep.
-This is loaded with caffeine.

15:20.500 --> 15:24.033
But we need caffeine,
especially women our age,

15:24.100 --> 15:27.300
or our bones will get brittle,
and we'll walk all stooped over.

15:30.834 --> 15:34.500
That's calcium, Rose.
Calcium not caffeine.

15:35.467 --> 15:37.700
This is what has been
keeping you awake.

15:37.767 --> 15:40.433
You mean, if I stop drinking that,
I can sleep?

15:40.500 --> 15:42.266
You may even blink again.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.567
I've got to get
to the counseling center.

15:45.633 --> 15:49.400
-Take the day off.
-Those people need me.

15:49.467 --> 15:55.000
-What good can you possibly be?
-I'll be there. I'll smile, nod.

15:55.066 --> 15:59.266
Fortunately, many of them hear voices.
I'll tell them one of them is mine.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.967
-Having a nice time?
-Wonderful.

16:11.633 --> 16:16.100
This reminds me of when you and Stan
double-dated with me and Lois Birnbaum.

16:16.166 --> 16:21.166
You and I jitterbugged at Roseland.
Then to Louie's for a malt.

16:21.233 --> 16:25.533
Stan did his walrus imitation
with the straws up his nose.

16:26.567 --> 16:30.734
-We've sure come a long way since then.
-Yeah. Now Stan uses breadsticks.

16:34.133 --> 16:36.066
I had a crush on you.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.934
-You did?
-Sure did.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.266
That's why I'm glad we're here.

16:41.066 --> 16:44.667
There's something very important
I want to ask you.

16:44.734 --> 16:45.867
Anything, Ted.

16:46.233 --> 16:48.834
-May I cut in?
-Oh, hell.

16:48.900 --> 16:53.000
Stan, good to see you.
I'll be at the table.

16:53.066 --> 16:55.867
-But, Ted--
-It's ok. Got all night.

16:55.934 --> 16:57.300
You two enjoy.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.233
Dorothy, you're not moving.
It's like our wedding night.

17:11.066 --> 17:13.200
I don't want to dance.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.700
Dorothy, please, this is really important.

17:16.100 --> 17:19.200
Today Ted booked
two airline seats for Acapulco.

17:19.567 --> 17:22.433
-What does that mean?
-He has no travel agent.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.834
Last time he went to Acapulco,
he got married.

17:26.900 --> 17:30.967
The last time I went to Coney island,
I got pregnant.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.934
He made reservations at the same hotel.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.066
He's wearing my most
expensive after-shave.

17:36.133 --> 17:40.667
-He's going to pop the question.
-You're being ridiculous.

17:40.734 --> 17:44.367
You're jumping to conclusions.
Besides, it's none of your business.

17:44.433 --> 17:45.600
Good night.

17:47.033 --> 17:52.000
Ted... I told Dorothy about Acapulco.

17:52.333 --> 17:55.600
-You heard me make the reservations?
-Yes. It's a terrible mistake.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.066
You mean... it's true?

17:59.066 --> 18:00.066
Well, yes.

18:02.633 --> 18:06.467
-I don't know what to say.
-I hope you'll say yes.

18:06.533 --> 18:09.667
Ted, there's something
you should know about Dorothy.

18:09.934 --> 18:11.667
She snores like a freight train.

18:12.867 --> 18:15.333
Well, who cares? She's still a great gal.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.934
Hey, guy, you're a wealthy doctor.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.867
You could have
gorgeous women at your feet.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.633
Why waste time with Dorothy?

18:23.567 --> 18:27.100
-You're a little out of line.
-I'm not knocking Dorothy.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.367
Oh, what would you call this,
a testimonial?

18:31.800 --> 18:34.000
Ok. I'll have to be blunt.

18:34.333 --> 18:39.000
Ted, you've always admired me
and envied everything I have.

18:39.300 --> 18:42.333
-That's why you want to marry Dorothy.
-Marry Dorothy?

18:42.800 --> 18:44.266
What are you talking about?

18:44.333 --> 18:47.333
Come on. Acapulco. The <i>El Presidente.</i>

18:47.400 --> 18:48.867
You're planning something big.

18:48.934 --> 18:53.400
Yeah. I met this great-looking stewardess
on the flight.

18:53.467 --> 18:54.934
I invited her to Acapulco.

18:55.033 --> 18:58.500
She could only go
if I found a sitter for her kids.

18:59.166 --> 19:01.033
Hey, I'd really appreciate it.

19:06.734 --> 19:10.066
-Come again?
-They are great kids.

19:10.133 --> 19:13.033
One of them plays with matches,
but you don't smoke, do you?

19:14.133 --> 19:16.333
Teddy, you old stud!

19:16.967 --> 19:20.033
Hey, you hang around the master
long enough,

19:20.100 --> 19:22.834
you'll pick up a few tricks. Yo.

19:23.266 --> 19:26.967
Listen, uh, Ted, I hate to interrupt,

19:28.200 --> 19:33.734
but, uh... what was all that sweet talk
about your having a crush on me?

19:33.800 --> 19:37.333
I did, but that was a long time ago.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
But...

19:39.533 --> 19:41.066
what about last night?

19:41.934 --> 19:46.166
Well, I'll always remember last night
as a very special evening.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.734
It was.
It was a very special evening.

19:50.200 --> 19:56.734
And that's why I'm going to keep
that deep, dark secret about yourself

19:56.800 --> 19:59.834
that you told me strictly
between the two of us.

20:01.734 --> 20:02.900
Thank you. I appreciate it.

20:02.967 --> 20:04.033
Don't mention it.

20:04.967 --> 20:07.433
Good night, Ted, and... goodbye.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Bye.

20:11.834 --> 20:15.367
-Collins, party of two, please.
-May I borrow this, please?

20:15.967 --> 20:20.700
Uh, ladies and gentlemen...
may I have your attention, please?

20:21.500 --> 20:25.367
The gentleman at table five
in the blue suit is impotent.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.633
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

20:33.433 --> 20:39.166
(nostalgic music playing)

20:48.200 --> 20:50.667
Rose. Ohh.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.734
Ohh, Rose.

20:54.266 --> 20:57.200
Honey, did you finally get to sleep?

21:00.133 --> 21:02.133
Well, wake up.
I have to talk to someone.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.367
I want to sleep.

21:04.433 --> 21:10.166
Listen. Dorothy's so upset with me,
and I don't blame her, after what I said.

21:10.567 --> 21:13.600
-How will I ever face her again?
-Uhhh...

21:13.867 --> 21:17.700
Rose, listen! Listen!
Am I a terrible person?

21:17.767 --> 21:20.033
I don't know. Who are you?

21:21.533 --> 21:24.467
-It's me, Blanche.
-Oh, Blanche.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.333
You're not a terrible person.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.934
You're just horny all the time.

21:33.900 --> 21:38.200
-(knock on door)
-Rose, it's Dorothy.

21:38.266 --> 21:41.333
Hush! I can't talk to her, not now.
Oh!

21:48.333 --> 21:49.567
Rose, honey...

21:50.834 --> 21:52.567
-are you awake?
-I don't know.

21:52.633 --> 21:53.834
That's good enough.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.567
I need to talk to someone.

21:57.467 --> 21:59.233
Rose, it's been a terrible night.

21:59.600 --> 22:03.367
Ted turned out to be as big a jerk
as Blanche said he was.

22:03.433 --> 22:05.367
-Ted who?
-Never mind.

22:06.533 --> 22:09.200
How did I let myself get involved?

22:09.266 --> 22:13.533
I mean, how could I allow a man
to come between me and my best friend?

22:13.900 --> 22:16.767
-Blanche won't forgive me.
-I forgive you.

22:16.834 --> 22:20.333
-Honey, where were you?
-Behind the drapes.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.066
What is this, <i>Hamlet?</i>

22:25.400 --> 22:29.033
I didn't want to face you
after all those things I said.

22:29.100 --> 22:34.800
Honey, I understand.
I understand why you were so upset.

22:34.867 --> 22:37.066
I'm not really sure you do, Dorothy.

22:37.367 --> 22:40.233
You see, I threw myself at Ted,

22:40.300 --> 22:44.033
and he tossed me
aside like ratty old sweat socks.

22:44.100 --> 22:47.967
Well, I'm not like you, Dorothy.
I'm not used to that kind of humiliation.

22:53.700 --> 22:57.600
I've never told anyone this before,
but I have a fragile ego.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.734
It'll be our little secret.

23:04.367 --> 23:06.033
Rose, don't worry.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.300
I finally found something to put
you to sleep.

23:08.367 --> 23:09.734
She's asleep.

23:10.333 --> 23:14.166
What? After I spent all day
making this Sicilian sleeping potion?

23:14.233 --> 23:16.166
Aw, Ma, come on.

23:16.233 --> 23:18.767
This saved my uncle Giuseppe's life.

23:18.834 --> 23:21.367
One swig and he slept through
the allied invasion.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.500
Ma, that's ridiculous.

23:24.567 --> 23:25.700
Here. Take a sip.

23:37.367 --> 23:39.367
Wow! This stuff really works.

23:39.734 --> 23:42.033
I got to remember what I put in this.

23:43.633 --> 23:45.834
It takes so little to make her happy.

23:51.333 --> 23:55.266
-Well, good night, Blanche.
-Good night, honey.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.533
Rose, good--

24:00.033 --> 24:01.100
Dorothy?

24:01.734 --> 24:03.333
Dorothy!

24:09.533 --> 24:14.500
(theme music playing)
