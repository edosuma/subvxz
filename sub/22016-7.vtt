WEBVTT

00:01.090 --> 00:02.210
Does everyone
have a glass?

00:02.280 --> 00:03.750
I'm just giving
my Thanksgiving toast.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.370
Oh, come on, Dad.
Isn't it weird

00:05.430 --> 00:07.420
that every year
you single out one person

00:07.470 --> 00:10.590
who somehow made you
extra proud this year?

00:10.650 --> 00:12.460
It makes the rest of us
feel like we --
It's you, Claire.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.090
Yeah! I knew it!

00:14.160 --> 00:15.840
And you, Phil,
and you, Mitchell.

00:16.010 --> 00:17.440
Actually, it's all of you.

00:17.510 --> 00:18.950
I know I get a hard time

00:19.010 --> 00:20.880
for stirring up competition
in the family,

00:20.950 --> 00:22.530
but look at the results.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.750
Phil scoring
with his new magic shop.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.440
Cam winning the big game.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.870
Claire winning the race.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.190
And Mitchell
scaring away that burglar.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.810
And you are
a winner, too, Jay.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.960
He wanted to spend more time
with Joe,

00:35.030 --> 00:36.450
so he's dropping him off

00:36.510 --> 00:38.970
and picking him up
from school every day.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.030
Dad, what is wrong
with her?

00:40.120 --> 00:41.320
I challenged her to get

00:41.390 --> 00:43.440
to 100,000 steps in a week.

00:43.450 --> 00:44.800
That's easy.
That's so easy.

00:44.810 --> 00:45.760
Without shopping.

00:45.820 --> 00:47.260
Oh.
I get -- I get the challenge.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.780
No.
She's 1,000 steps from glory.

00:49.840 --> 00:50.940
Like the rest of you,

00:51.010 --> 00:52.800
she was motivated
by my stingy praise.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.830
As I look around the room,
I see nothing but winners,

00:54.900 --> 00:56.420
and I couldn't be prouder.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.620
To us!

00:57.630 --> 01:00.190
Everyone here is a winner.

01:16.270 --> 01:19.070
Oh, you knew I was nervous
about the big game,

01:19.120 --> 01:20.340
so you set out my -- Okay.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.380
Sprinkles are for heroes.

01:22.440 --> 01:23.510
Here, Daddy.

01:23.580 --> 01:26.130
Thank you for protecting us.
Oh.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.380
We're all so proud of Mitchell

01:27.450 --> 01:29.330
about what happened
the other day.

01:29.330 --> 01:31.300
What I was thinking is,
we could

01:31.370 --> 01:32.470
Oh, my gosh!

01:32.540 --> 01:33.690
Was there a break-in?

01:33.750 --> 01:35.270
Yeah, yeah.
It was -- It was crazy.

01:35.270 --> 01:36.920
I just started yelling
at him,

01:36.990 --> 01:38.640
and I guess
I scared him away, so...

01:38.710 --> 01:41.230
Oh, my gosh, sweetie.
Are you okay?

01:41.300 --> 01:42.850
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:42.910 --> 01:44.310
You're so brave.
Oh, honey.

01:44.380 --> 01:46.020
So proud.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.450
If the robber comes back
when Brave Daddy isn't here,

01:48.520 --> 01:50.650
we can use these.
Okay, no, no, no, no.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.420
I had to confiscate those
at school.

01:52.490 --> 01:53.610
They're very dangerous,

01:53.670 --> 01:55.930
and, plus,
you should avoid the cliche.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.980
Confiscating contraband
is part of my new
job at school.

01:59.050 --> 02:01.410
I was recently promoted
to

02:01.480 --> 02:02.870
acting vice principal.

02:02.930 --> 02:04.530
Which has nothing to do
with acting.

02:04.620 --> 02:06.750
That was made very clear to me.

02:06.820 --> 02:08.940
Hey. Hey.
Y-You seem a little nervous.

02:09.009 --> 02:10.460
Are you -- Are you worried
about the big game?

02:10.520 --> 02:11.840
Yeah.
I'm a little nervous.

02:11.910 --> 02:13.660
The Rattlesnakes have beat us
the last six years,

02:13.730 --> 02:15.030
and we cannot lose.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.210
Is any of this because
their coach is a woman?

02:17.280 --> 02:19.620
I mean, shouldn't we be
rooting for her, because --

02:19.680 --> 02:21.150
Oh, what, because she's
another straight person

02:21.220 --> 02:23.050
coaching football?

02:23.120 --> 02:24.850
Well, good luck.
Thank you, sweetie.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.770
You know, I can't promise
that I'll make you as proud

02:26.840 --> 02:28.910
as your daddy who fought off
a burglar, but I will try.

02:28.980 --> 02:30.760
You know, there's murmurs
that the booster club

02:30.830 --> 02:33.150
is gonna divert some of our
money to the science program.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.530
Because that's what made
the Kennedys cool, you know --

02:35.600 --> 02:38.220
playing science
on the lawn.

02:38.290 --> 02:40.050
Ow! The first person
who figures out

02:40.120 --> 02:43.560
how to stick these numbers
right on is gonna be rich.

02:43.620 --> 02:45.480
You could just pin it to
your shirt before
you put it on.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.190
Have you shared this idea
with anyone else?

02:48.260 --> 02:51.050
When Alex was a baby, I used to
throw her in a jogging stroller,

02:51.120 --> 02:53.070
and she was my running buddy.

02:53.130 --> 02:55.720
This week, when she found out
I was doing a 10K,

02:55.790 --> 02:57.940
she insisted on coming.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.170
Snore.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.210
I'm using my mom as a subject
for my stupid psych paper

03:01.270 --> 03:03.440
because I started too late
to sign out a monkey.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.780
It's about positive versus
negative reinforcement.

03:05.850 --> 03:08.380
First half of the race --
"You can do it, Mom!"

03:08.450 --> 03:10.500
Second half --
"It's not your day, lady!"

03:10.570 --> 03:11.900
Thankfully, after it's done,

03:11.970 --> 03:13.950
I'll still be able to give out
the banana I bought.

03:14.020 --> 03:16.160
Thank you so much
for taking care of Joe.

03:16.220 --> 03:18.840
I still have to get
some things from the store
for dinner.

03:18.910 --> 03:20.110
It's no problem.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.280
I got a lot of knowledge
to pass on.

03:22.350 --> 03:24.300
You been practicing
your burping drills?

03:24.360 --> 03:25.830
Yes!

03:25.900 --> 03:27.780
Better.
Okay, enough chitchat.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.550
Give me the V.I.P. pass
for the sale.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.790
Everybody's heard
of the H. Bronfman Clothiers

03:31.850 --> 03:33.640
Black Friday sale
where the hoi polloi

03:33.710 --> 03:35.560
fight over tuxedos like animals.

03:35.630 --> 03:37.460
But on Thanksgiving Day,

03:37.530 --> 03:39.830
a select few are invited
to get first crack.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.360
If I get everything I want,

03:41.430 --> 03:44.980
that tux will be 80% off
in Tammy Bosworth's dorm room.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.140
Black gold.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.950
I got it as a tip
from some club members

03:48.020 --> 03:49.940
who had me "deal"
with some geese.

03:50.010 --> 03:52.440
You will not taint
this experience.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.910
Claire, why do
you have that number?

03:55.980 --> 03:57.610
Are you in a pageant?

03:57.680 --> 04:00.670
She's running a 10K,
and she is going to do great.

04:00.730 --> 04:05.750
I know
that you're gonna
make us oh-so proud!

04:05.820 --> 04:07.290
Obviously, this was meant
to be a group hug,

04:07.360 --> 04:09.110
and my invitation
got lost in the mail.
Mm.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.160
Phil...

04:10.230 --> 04:11.710
that crazy phone booth

04:11.780 --> 04:13.450
that you ordered
for your magic trick --

04:13.500 --> 04:15.180
It's already at my house.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.680
It's here two days early?!

04:16.750 --> 04:18.970
I can shoot
my how-to video today!

04:19.040 --> 04:21.470
Haley! Showtime!

04:21.540 --> 04:23.090
It goes without saying
that the greatest trick

04:23.160 --> 04:25.520
to come out of World War II
is the Normandy Phone Booth.

04:25.590 --> 04:29.440
Over the years, its reputation
has...ebbed and flowed.

04:29.510 --> 04:30.650
It was famously booed

04:30.710 --> 04:32.980
at the 1969
Narragansett Magic Festival.

04:33.050 --> 04:34.420
Of course, this is a time

04:34.480 --> 04:36.450
when most people
are into protest magic.

04:36.520 --> 04:40.560
So naturally, they would thumb
their nose at a classic trick

04:40.620 --> 04:44.290
where a heroic soldier
dashes into a phone booth

04:44.380 --> 04:46.430
to make a world-saving call

04:46.500 --> 04:48.800
while it slowly
fills with water!

04:48.870 --> 04:51.100
Come on, hippies!

04:51.170 --> 04:53.940
God!

04:54.000 --> 04:55.800
All right, buddy.
Run outside
and play real quick.

04:55.870 --> 04:57.370
I'm gonna take care
something upstairs.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.190
I had to update my profile pic

04:59.260 --> 05:01.660
on this new social-media app
called Inseam.

05:01.730 --> 05:04.480
It's super cool.
No one knows about it.

05:04.550 --> 05:07.020
Some old guys were using it
for home tailoring,

05:07.100 --> 05:08.600
but then two Brooklyn deejays

05:08.670 --> 05:11.090
started sharing a couple
of videos on it,
and it blew up.

05:11.150 --> 05:12.140
Not approachable.

05:12.210 --> 05:13.320
Too approachable.

05:13.390 --> 05:15.390
There's my guy.

05:15.460 --> 05:17.980
What's up?

05:18.040 --> 05:19.400
Dude, I was
just about to leave,

05:19.460 --> 05:21.310
and I saw your new pic
popped up on Inseam.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.230
You're on Inseam?

05:22.300 --> 05:23.620
Yes, I've been on it
for a week.

05:23.750 --> 05:26.300
Okay, look at your picture.
Joe is in a tree behind you.

05:26.770 --> 05:28.070
Whoa!

05:28.140 --> 05:29.870
Aah! Aah.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.270
Oh, my God,
he's right there!

05:31.340 --> 05:32.570
Hang on, Joe!

05:32.640 --> 05:33.680
Hello?

05:33.740 --> 05:34.760
What's going on with Joe?

05:34.830 --> 05:35.860
<i>You're on Inseam?</i>

05:35.930 --> 05:36.910
Of course I'm on Inseam.

05:36.980 --> 05:38.950
Is my son
hanging from a tree?

05:39.020 --> 05:40.980
Oh, that's great!
You fell for it.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.840
I'm, uh -- I'm getting
pretty good at Photoshop.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.250
That's a fake picture?

05:44.320 --> 05:46.840
Yeah, I got a bunch of Joe
doing dangerous stuff.

05:46.910 --> 05:48.880
You're gonna have to show me
this later, okay?

05:48.940 --> 05:50.540
Will do.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.580
Well, thanks to you,

05:52.650 --> 05:54.150
now I'm all sweaty,
and it's gonna be impossible

05:54.310 --> 05:55.330
to judge the silk shirts.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.120
They're supposed to blouse,
not cling.

05:57.180 --> 05:58.600
Hey, can I see that card
for a second?

05:58.670 --> 06:01.100
What are you doing?
I'll put this card
back in your hand

06:01.170 --> 06:03.820
when you Photoshop that kid's
head in an alligator's mouth.

06:05.780 --> 06:07.510
<i>Upper Valley
on the 2-yard line.</i>

06:07.580 --> 06:09.130
<i>10 seconds to go.</i>

06:09.200 --> 06:10.500
<i>A touchdown
will win the game.</i>

06:10.660 --> 06:13.020
Okay, timeout!
Timeout!

06:13.080 --> 06:14.820
Let's go, Dolphins!

06:14.880 --> 06:16.570
Coach, what is
our defense?

06:16.640 --> 06:17.900
Okay, you know what?
It's a running situation,

06:17.970 --> 06:19.760
but they've been killing us
with that pass all day.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.690
My gut tells me they're
gonna pass, but

06:21.760 --> 06:22.610
Okay, just let me think
about it.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.160
Move. Move!

06:24.230 --> 06:25.850
<i>Those dumb bastards</i>

06:25.910 --> 06:27.280
<i>are going to be
thinking pass,</i>

06:27.350 --> 06:29.650
<i>which is why
we're going to run.</i>

06:29.720 --> 06:30.950
<i>Trap Two, on the left side.</i>

06:31.020 --> 06:32.280
My vice principal
walkie-talkie

06:32.350 --> 06:34.000
accidentally picked up
that Upper Valley coach

06:34.070 --> 06:35.240
calling her dumb lady play.

06:35.310 --> 06:37.910
Now, was I gonna change
my defense?

06:37.970 --> 06:41.610
Only some spineless
win-at-all-costs glory hound

06:41.680 --> 06:45.830
would choose winning
over showing some moral fiber.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.500
<i>Dolphins win!
Dolphins win!</i>

06:47.570 --> 06:48.830
Yes!

06:52.620 --> 06:54.510
Everybody
in that stadium,
including me...

06:54.570 --> 06:55.920
Well...
...was expecting a pass.

06:55.990 --> 06:57.580
But your instincts
told you something else.

06:57.640 --> 07:00.700
That's big-time, my friend.
Well, I-I-I appreciate it, Jay.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.580
Uh, thank you.

07:01.750 --> 07:02.930
Mitchell!

07:04.450 --> 07:05.650
I'm a fraud.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.950
Well, then stop telling
that barista

07:07.020 --> 07:08.670
that you understudied Javert
on Broadway.

07:08.740 --> 07:10.720
He knows your name.
He can look it up.

07:10.760 --> 07:11.760
No, I overheard
the lady coach

07:11.930 --> 07:13.060
call her play
on my walkie-talkie,

07:13.130 --> 07:14.810
and I changed my defense
to win the game.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.350
And now I'm having anxiety,
and I have to confess.

07:17.410 --> 07:18.810
No, you -- you are
not gonna confess.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.900
You're gonna smush
that anxiety
into a little ball,

07:20.970 --> 07:22.530
and you're gonna push it
into that little, tiny hole

07:22.600 --> 07:24.390
in your soul
where childhood traumas go.

07:24.450 --> 07:26.310
Everybody here is a winner.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.520
I-If you end up being
the one loser at the table,

07:28.590 --> 07:31.610
I'm gonna get nothing
but condescending pity
from everybody,

07:31.680 --> 07:35.200
especially Claire,
that insufferable phony.

07:35.270 --> 07:37.080
Mm.
Hey, so pretty!

07:40.890 --> 07:43.810
Luke!
Oh, hey, Gloria.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.140
Sure love those bangs.

07:45.210 --> 07:46.510
What's the story
with those?

07:46.580 --> 07:48.180
I know
you have been avoiding me

07:48.310 --> 07:50.230
because there are
no Photoshopped pictures

07:50.300 --> 07:52.010
of Joe in danger.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.900
And the the answer to your
question is very simple --

07:53.970 --> 07:55.030
They frame my face.

07:55.350 --> 07:56.850
Oh, those pictures.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.020
Here we are.

08:02.090 --> 08:05.430
Ah.
Joe poking a bees' nest.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.960
Mm-hmm.

08:07.030 --> 08:10.680
Oh, and Joe killing
Lee Harvey Oswald.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.370
So cute.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.970
Jay, Luke is a genius.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.190
Thanks, buddy.

08:17.260 --> 08:18.660
You can go do
your fancy shopping now.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.440
Awesome. To make up
for the time I lost,

08:20.510 --> 08:23.200
I'm gonna baby oil my heels
so I can try on shoes faster.

08:23.260 --> 08:26.200
Phil, did you see
this Photoshop
stuff that Luke did?

08:26.270 --> 08:27.680
He's a real magician.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.200
I guess
he came by it honestly.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.710
That means the world
to me, Jay.

08:32.770 --> 08:34.020
I'm living a lie.

08:34.090 --> 08:36.240
Claire, everyone
in this family's a winner

08:36.309 --> 08:37.309
except for me.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.600
Abraca-failure.

08:39.659 --> 08:41.730
Ready to fill
this thing up?

08:41.799 --> 08:44.070
Um, yeah.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:44.130 --> 08:45.330
The -- The whole reason
we're here

08:45.400 --> 08:47.500
is to use the pool water,
which is recyclable.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.620
I'm sort of a hero
in the sustainable
magic movement.

08:49.690 --> 08:51.940
I'd hate to lose
my three green rabbits rating.

08:52.010 --> 08:53.110
Okay.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.480
Should we start filming?

08:54.540 --> 08:56.090
For sure.
Yeah. For sure.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.070
I-I-I think I'll --
I'll probably just
take a quick minute.

08:59.130 --> 09:00.900
As a young man,
I had no fear of any trick

09:00.970 --> 09:02.420
where I was jammed
into tight spaces --

09:02.490 --> 09:05.600
Fox in a Box, The Wrong
Shepherd, Einstein's Birdbath.

09:05.670 --> 09:09.070
Lately, though, I have had
a touch of claustrophobia,

09:09.140 --> 09:10.560
which is usually cleared up

09:10.630 --> 09:13.360
by a quick call
to my super-supportive wife.

09:13.430 --> 09:15.060
Oh, you finally picked up.

09:15.130 --> 09:16.500
No, no, it's not an emergency.

09:16.570 --> 09:18.730
I just -- Hello? Claire?

09:18.800 --> 09:20.650
Just give me the word, Dad.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.870
Oh. Yep. Uh...

09:22.940 --> 09:24.040
Let's...

09:24.110 --> 09:25.170
Let's do this.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.830
Great. Ready?

09:26.890 --> 09:28.580
Yeah.
And...action.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.900
Hello, and congratulations
on your purchase

09:30.960 --> 09:32.110
of the Normandy
Phone Booth.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.630
The following
will demonstrate

09:33.700 --> 09:37.250
just how much fun
you've...dialed up.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.610
Here we are on D-Day.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.710
Where's
the damned air support?

09:46.780 --> 09:48.960
Oh, good.

09:49.030 --> 09:51.370
A ph-- phone booth.

09:51.430 --> 09:53.750
I hear the Nazis
have booby-trapped these,

09:53.820 --> 09:55.300
but I will...

09:55.370 --> 09:57.320
I definitely will take
the risk

09:57.390 --> 09:58.810
of calling Allied Command.

10:04.430 --> 10:05.900
Hello, General.

10:05.970 --> 10:09.700
Yes, the enemy
<i>is</i> all around us.

10:09.770 --> 10:13.010
Blast!

10:13.070 --> 10:15.240
This is one
of the phone booths

10:15.310 --> 10:16.510
that's booby-trapped.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.080
Oh, no!

10:18.140 --> 10:21.130
Yes, General,
the enemy is closing in!

10:21.200 --> 10:23.370
There's no esca--

10:23.430 --> 10:24.700
Haley!
Get me out of here!

10:24.770 --> 10:26.390
Who's Haley?
I'm Nurse Rutherford.

10:27.850 --> 10:30.110
If I can't do this trick,
my magic shop

10:30.170 --> 10:32.210
is gonna be the laughingstock
of the mini-mall.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.010
And there's still
a Blockbuster there.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.210
Honey, I know you're
going through something,

10:36.280 --> 10:37.650
but you need to keep it
to yourself,

10:37.710 --> 10:40.430
because we will not be
the loser family this year.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.730
Claire.
Yeah?

10:41.800 --> 10:43.170
I had a genius idea.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.050
Your race went right
by Pritchett's Closets.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.570
Uh-huh.
Pull the security tape.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.810
We'll blow up a frame of you
in the lead and run a big ad --

10:48.870 --> 10:51.740
"Pritchett's. Leading
the Pack for 30 Years."

10:51.810 --> 10:53.780
Genius!
I love it, Dad! Yes!

10:53.850 --> 10:55.150
I am on that!

10:55.220 --> 10:56.600
Wow.

10:56.670 --> 10:57.880
We have problem.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.380
<i>I</i> had a problem.

11:00.690 --> 11:02.620
H-H-- Hello?

11:02.690 --> 11:04.920
Hel--
Damn it.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.690
Phil, this better be
an emergency.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.260
Oh, you finally picked up.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.050
No, no, it's not an emergency.
I just --

11:10.110 --> 11:12.750
I'm running a race, and you
just screwed up my playlist!

11:17.870 --> 11:19.020
From that point on,

11:19.090 --> 11:21.160
I was no longer
on the actual race course.

11:21.220 --> 11:24.380
Thank you!

11:25.310 --> 11:27.450
Thanks.

11:27.510 --> 11:31.570
I guess I hit a point
where I funneled back
onto the course.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.800
I did notice that
I seemed to have more energy

11:33.870 --> 11:35.490
than the few people
in front of me,

11:35.560 --> 11:38.620
but I didn't --
I didn't think much of it.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.500
I did it!
I won! I won!

11:43.560 --> 11:44.880
Did you see that, honey?
I won!

11:44.950 --> 11:46.180
Uh, no, you didn't.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.930
I was standing at the 5K mark
and never saw you.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.800
- What?
- Claire!

11:49.870 --> 11:52.090
I was at the store,
and I saw you win!

11:52.160 --> 11:54.120
Oh, honey!
Oh!

11:54.190 --> 11:55.640
Oh.
I know her!

11:55.710 --> 11:57.830
She's my stepdaughter!

11:57.890 --> 11:59.060
There's not gonna be
any footage

11:59.130 --> 12:00.400
of you running past
Pritchett's Closets

12:00.460 --> 12:02.870
because you cut two miles
out of a six-mile race.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.650
Better tell Grandpa
you didn't win.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.900
Oh, you are
my moral compass.

12:06.970 --> 12:08.200
Which is why I don't want
to talk to you

12:08.270 --> 12:09.490
for the rest of the day.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.390
Luke!

12:10.460 --> 12:12.040
I need a favor,
no questions asked.

12:12.110 --> 12:13.580
What do you need?
Phone cards?

12:13.640 --> 12:16.230
No. I need you to Photoshop
a picture of me from today

12:16.280 --> 12:18.460
running in front
of Pritchett's Closets.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.870
No problem.

12:20.930 --> 12:22.600
New problem.
I --

12:25.010 --> 12:26.490
I want to grab a picture
of you and Claire.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.320
I want to post it
on my Inseam account.

12:28.410 --> 12:29.510
Oh, what's Inseam?

12:29.580 --> 12:30.960
I use it for home tailoring.
Oh.

12:31.240 --> 12:31.990
Claire.
Yeah?

12:32.060 --> 12:33.130
Could you get in here,
please?

12:33.200 --> 12:36.220
My two superstars.
Okay!

12:36.280 --> 12:39.020
I can't believe you won
with that bad knee.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.990
Well, at least if somebody
tries to steal that thing,

12:41.050 --> 12:42.220
they got to get
through this guy.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.790
I just did
what any hero would do.

12:44.860 --> 12:46.440
It's...
Are you wearing makeup?

12:46.510 --> 12:48.430
Uh, well, yeah.
I got a bruise.

12:48.490 --> 12:50.730
I thought -- I thought
you screamed and he ran away?

12:50.800 --> 12:53.150
Uh, well, there was a --
There was a scuffle.

12:53.220 --> 12:54.480
You went
with your instinct.

12:54.550 --> 12:56.200
Fight or flight.
You fought.

12:56.270 --> 12:58.200
I'm gonna post this
on Inseam.

12:58.270 --> 12:59.710
Double-click.

12:59.770 --> 13:00.810
Damn it!

13:00.870 --> 13:01.910
<i>You</i> fought.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.640
Mm-hmm.
<i>You</i> fought?

13:03.710 --> 13:05.690
Uh-huh. How close did you
get to this "intruder"?

13:05.760 --> 13:07.350
Okay, Claire.
That is just about enough.

13:07.410 --> 13:08.550
Mitchell
suffered a trauma,

13:08.610 --> 13:11.150
and I don't appreciate
your mocking tone.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.390
Excuse us.
Okay?

13:13.450 --> 13:15.000
Thank you, sweetie.

13:15.070 --> 13:16.140
Okay, look,
we both know

13:16.210 --> 13:18.290
two things for certain --
I look fabulous in coral,

13:18.360 --> 13:20.540
and you didn't fight off
any intruder.

13:20.610 --> 13:21.840
There -- There is a backstory.

13:21.910 --> 13:24.660
In the summer of 1984,
inspired by "The Karate Kid,"

13:24.730 --> 13:27.250
I went through
a martial arts phase.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.180
When Cam brought
those nunchucks home,

13:29.250 --> 13:31.140
it was just too much to resist.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.470
Hello, old friend.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.070
30 years later, once again,

13:36.140 --> 13:38.810
it was time to sweep the leg.

13:44.470 --> 13:46.430
Oh! Oh.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.500
Oh, God.
Oh, no!

13:55.610 --> 13:57.480
Why didn't you just tell me?
I don't know.

13:57.550 --> 13:59.330
You -- You walked in, and you
asked if there was a break-in,

13:59.400 --> 14:02.350
and I-I was embarrassed
and possibly concussed,

14:02.420 --> 14:04.100
so I just --
I went with it.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.010
Besides, my dad and Claire
cannot know, okay?

14:06.060 --> 14:09.290
That whole
"Karate Kid" summer,
they called me "Kung Sue."

14:09.360 --> 14:10.310
Oh.

14:10.390 --> 14:13.960
Turkey is gonna be ready
in 10 minutes!

14:14.030 --> 14:15.830
Where is Phil?
I'll let him know.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.400
Okay.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.170
- 10 minutes.
- I can't take it!

14:20.240 --> 14:21.350
Just breathe, Dad.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.540
We are breaking
this fear of yours.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.220
I'm dying here!
Hey, hey, hey!

14:24.290 --> 14:25.490
Look at me.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.780
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life

14:26.840 --> 14:28.680
as an open-space magician?

14:30.460 --> 14:32.150
Yeah.

14:32.220 --> 14:36.820
Jay, I saw on Inseam
that there was
a Thanksgiving pageant

14:36.890 --> 14:38.570
at Joe's school.

14:38.590 --> 14:40.110
Why didn't you tell me?

14:41.390 --> 14:43.290
I totally forgot.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.560
Joe hasn't been in school
for a week.

14:45.630 --> 14:47.550
I had a falling-out
with his teacher.

14:47.610 --> 14:50.330
And got sent
to the principal's office.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.480
You said some pretty harsh
things to Mrs. Barrish.

14:52.490 --> 14:56.340
In my defense, um,
this banquet she's planning

14:56.410 --> 14:58.410
is not historically accurate.

14:58.470 --> 15:01.890
For example, I don't remember
a tandoori chicken option

15:01.960 --> 15:03.540
at the first Thanksgiving.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.500
We have children here
from many ethnicities,

15:05.570 --> 15:07.450
and we try to make them all
feel included.

15:07.500 --> 15:11.400
Be that as it may, history
does not record Pocahontas

15:11.450 --> 15:14.610
asking John Smith
to pass the sashimi roll

15:14.670 --> 15:16.940
while Myles Standish
helps himself

15:17.010 --> 15:20.060
to gluten-free
huevos rancheros!

15:20.160 --> 15:22.780
After that, it got heated,
and we got expelled.

15:22.780 --> 15:25.100
"We"?

15:25.170 --> 15:27.640
But they'll call.
They need my check.

15:27.670 --> 15:29.350
Why didn't the school
tell me anything?

15:29.420 --> 15:31.820
It's like I am
off their e-mail list.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.760
Huh.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.860
I didn't even see
the costumes.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.290
Well, he didn't have
a costume.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.110
No, he was the narrator.
Kid told the whole story.

15:39.180 --> 15:41.170
Ay, papi.

15:41.230 --> 15:43.330
You must have been
so cute.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.020
Why don't you perform it
for everybody at dinner?

15:46.090 --> 15:48.760
I'll go get my phone,
and we'll film it.

15:48.820 --> 15:50.660
Okay?
Yes.

15:52.190 --> 15:55.960
I gotta get you up to speed
in a hurry, buddy.

15:56.030 --> 15:58.770
The story of Thanksgiving.
Here goes.

15:58.830 --> 16:00.220
It's no use!

16:00.290 --> 16:01.270
I can't do it!

16:01.340 --> 16:03.100
Aaahh!

16:06.010 --> 16:09.190
99,999...100,000!

16:09.260 --> 16:11.530
Sonuvabitch, she did it!

16:11.600 --> 16:12.950
Nice one!

16:13.020 --> 16:14.050
See that, people?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.400
Another person doing
their best, thanks to me.

16:16.470 --> 16:18.400
And now it's time to eat.

16:18.470 --> 16:19.470
Hey, Google,

16:19.640 --> 16:21.820
how much time left
on the turkey?

16:21.890 --> 16:22.990
<i>Two minutes remaining.</i>

16:23.060 --> 16:25.560
See? I can control
that crazy doughnut,

16:25.630 --> 16:26.580
I can do the steps --

16:26.650 --> 16:28.200
I have two achievements,

16:28.280 --> 16:30.110
and the rest
have only one.

16:30.180 --> 16:31.100
So, Grandpa
really motivated you

16:31.230 --> 16:32.980
by telling you you couldn't
do something, huh?

16:33.050 --> 16:34.190
I need to see
that My StepCounter

16:34.250 --> 16:36.020
for a paper I'm writing.

16:36.090 --> 16:38.340
Everybody achieved
something today,

16:38.410 --> 16:40.360
so now it's Joe's turn.

16:40.430 --> 16:41.480
Joe...

16:41.540 --> 16:43.760
tell us about
the first Thanksgiving.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.210
Oh!
Come up here, buddy.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.780
You got this.

16:46.850 --> 16:50.100
There was once a land
of godless natives.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.690
They did not know
any better

16:51.750 --> 16:53.970
until, one day,
the white man arrived.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.490
What is this?

16:55.560 --> 16:57.710
The white man took pity
on these primitives

16:57.780 --> 17:00.360
by teaching them
to cultivate the land.

17:00.430 --> 17:03.780
But their kindness
was mistaken for aggression,

17:03.850 --> 17:06.920
and a war began.

17:06.990 --> 17:08.500
What kind of school
is this?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.640
This is
what I was taught.
What?!

17:10.710 --> 17:14.030
Eventually,
peace was restored,

17:14.040 --> 17:17.910
and we bestowed them with
our nation's highest honor --

17:17.980 --> 17:20.180
naming football teams
for them.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.930
Joe, what play is this?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.839
I wasn't in a play!
I don't go to school anymore!

17:28.109 --> 17:29.910
All right, fine.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.440
We got kicked out, okay?

17:31.510 --> 17:33.090
Little argument
with the principal.

17:33.180 --> 17:34.410
You've been lying to me

17:34.480 --> 17:38.530
while I was celebrating you
as an amazing father?
Oh, my...

17:38.600 --> 17:39.800
Hey, Gloria,
this is weird.

17:39.870 --> 17:41.890
I downloaded
your My StepCounter data

17:41.960 --> 17:43.070
onto my computer,

17:43.140 --> 17:44.640
and it's showing your path
this morning

17:44.710 --> 17:46.460
was the same route
my mom took in her race.

17:46.490 --> 17:48.030
Hmm?

17:48.090 --> 17:51.180
I was never going to get
100,000 steps.

17:51.250 --> 17:54.400
But then I learned that Claire
was going on a Turkey Trot.

17:54.470 --> 17:55.780
The second time I hugged her,

17:55.850 --> 17:58.440
it was a little harder
because she was really wet.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.490
So I'm basically just
your StepCounter mule?

18:01.490 --> 18:03.040
I thought
you cared about my race.

18:03.110 --> 18:04.290
I love you very much,
Claire,

18:04.360 --> 18:07.460
but your exercise
doesn't really interest me.

18:07.550 --> 18:10.380
Hang on. When did Claire
run past Pritchett's Closets?

18:10.450 --> 18:13.070
'Cause this thing says
she never got near it.

18:13.140 --> 18:15.340
Well, that's probably
the StepCounter
made a mistake.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.120
Oh, yeah, did it?
Or -- Or --

18:17.190 --> 18:18.590
Or did you take
a little shortcut?

18:18.660 --> 18:19.910
No, I was
probably going so fast

18:19.980 --> 18:21.080
it couldn't even keep up
with me.

18:21.140 --> 18:23.280
I have a picture of it.
Let me see.

18:23.350 --> 18:25.050
Luke?

18:25.180 --> 18:26.720
And there you go.

18:26.780 --> 18:29.180
That is me clearly running
in front of
Pritchett's Closets.

18:29.270 --> 18:31.540
Oh, yeah, yeah.
With a Reagan/Bush poster

18:31.600 --> 18:32.650
in the window, huh?

18:32.770 --> 18:34.920
The photo is a fake.

18:34.990 --> 18:36.580
It's not <i> my</i> fault.
Manny made it.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.690
Manny was Photoshopping
everything?

18:38.760 --> 18:41.110
So Joe was in real danger?

18:41.180 --> 18:42.660
I did not realize
how easy it'd be

18:42.730 --> 18:43.820
for you
to connect those dots.

18:43.870 --> 18:45.270
Pretty disappointed
in you, Luke.

18:45.330 --> 18:47.340
Well, you know, it's easy to
see where he learned it from.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.120
His mother's a cheater!

18:49.190 --> 18:52.010
What?! Oh, don't get
so hot and bothered.
Uh-huh! Mm.

18:52.070 --> 18:53.860
Your makeup's already running,
and what do --
Stop it.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.880
Do you have
a Chinese character
on your bruise?

18:55.940 --> 18:57.660
Yeah, it's probably an imprint
from the intruder's ring.

18:57.710 --> 19:00.000
He was -- I'm sure he was
in a gang of some sort.

19:00.020 --> 19:01.320
Just give it up, Mitchell.

19:01.380 --> 19:02.820
He knocked himself out
with some nunchucks

19:02.900 --> 19:05.070
that I confiscated
as acting vice principal.

19:05.140 --> 19:07.120
Oh, my God!
Kung Sue is back.

19:07.190 --> 19:08.540
Daddy, did you hear that?

19:08.610 --> 19:11.360
Well, Cam -- Cam didn't
really win the football game.

19:11.430 --> 19:14.060
Uh-huh. He stole the last play
from the lady coach!

19:14.130 --> 19:16.000
Accidentally! I overheard it
on a walkie-talkie

19:16.060 --> 19:19.070
that I require
as an acting vice principal,

19:19.140 --> 19:20.570
which is a position
I'm pretty proud of

19:20.640 --> 19:22.350
because I'm basically
a sheriff.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.770
You're not basically -- No.
Yes, I am basically a sheriff!

19:24.840 --> 19:26.430
I wear a hat!

19:26.490 --> 19:28.310
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:28.380 --> 19:30.140
Dad is doing his trick,
and he's never done it before.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.430
He could die.

19:32.620 --> 19:33.920
Come on!

19:33.930 --> 19:35.700
Oh, Phil.
Honey, wait!

19:35.770 --> 19:37.750
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do!

19:37.820 --> 19:41.190
I'm the only loser in
a remarkable family
of winners.

19:41.260 --> 19:42.390
No, no, no!

19:42.460 --> 19:44.060
We are
not all winners!

19:44.180 --> 19:46.860
It turned out
we all stink!

19:46.930 --> 19:47.930
It doesn't matter!

19:48.000 --> 19:50.280
I don't want to live
a life ruled by fear!

19:50.350 --> 19:52.270
I have to do
this trick today.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.250
Although, it is
getting hard to breathe!

19:55.320 --> 19:56.750
Don't stop, Dad!
You can do this!

19:56.820 --> 19:58.140
I believe in you!

19:58.320 --> 20:00.280
That's not helping, honey!
Very interesting.

20:00.340 --> 20:02.030
Okay, I'm just gonna try
to barrel through this.

20:02.090 --> 20:04.710
It's Normandy. I'm an American
G.I. named Tony Ranzetti.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.230
I'm from Brooklyn, and I love
my mama's home cooking!

20:07.300 --> 20:08.820
But I don't think
I'm gonna be able to get out!

20:08.880 --> 20:11.490
Is he talking
as Tony Ranzetti or as Phil?

20:11.550 --> 20:12.840
What is wrong
with you cowards?!

20:12.910 --> 20:15.110
Phil needs help!

20:15.170 --> 20:18.040
Kung Sue's back at it.

20:18.110 --> 20:18.980
Hey! Hey!
Oh, God!

20:19.050 --> 20:20.500
Ohh!
Ah!

20:20.560 --> 20:21.980
It's too late to get out!
Oh.

20:22.050 --> 20:24.270
No!
This was a mistake!!

20:24.330 --> 20:25.520
Something's wrong.
Dad?

20:25.580 --> 20:26.870
Oh, God.
Phil! Phil!

20:29.870 --> 20:31.810
Oh, my God!
What -- What...

20:33.140 --> 20:35.230
Holy crap,
where'd he go?!

20:35.390 --> 20:39.610
Private Ranzetti reporting
Operation Overlord
is a success.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.170
Oh!
Wow!

20:41.200 --> 20:42.550
Cocktails are on me.

20:42.670 --> 20:44.820
That was amazing!
Gotta hand it
to you, Phil.

20:44.890 --> 20:46.450
You get
the big turkey leg.

20:46.570 --> 20:48.560
Let's take this party
to the table!

20:49.590 --> 20:51.540
Come on, hippies.

20:54.050 --> 20:56.750
Cam, it's late.

20:58.730 --> 21:01.170
Cam, I have work
early in the morning.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.140
Cameron!
I cannot sleep!

21:06.210 --> 21:07.360
Well, you should have
thought about that

21:07.430 --> 21:08.960
before you challenged me
that I couldn't do

21:09.030 --> 21:10.430
10,000 steps in a day.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.860
Well, how close are you?

21:11.930 --> 21:12.750
125.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.680
Okay, fine.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.350
Wait. 125 left?

21:18.420 --> 21:19.450
Nope.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.670
Oh, my God.
