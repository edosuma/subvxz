YOU ARE THE MAJORITY.

13:46.310 --> 13:47.172
OKAY.

13:47.206 --> 13:49.965
SO IT ALL DEMAND DID --
DEPENDS ON.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.103
I AM YOUR SHIELD.

13:51.137 --> 13:52.310
I AGREE WITH THAT.

13:52.344 --> 13:55.172
AND I WILL BE FIGHTING FOR
YOU.

13:55.206 --> 13:57.034
I HAVE A SOFT SPOT FOR
CHRISTIAN.

13:57.068 --> 14:01.206
BUT HE'S PUTTING PRESSURE ON ME
FOR MY VOTE WHEN I KNOW HE

14:01.241 --> 14:03.275
DOESN'T NEED ONE MORE VOTE.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.137
HE NEEDS THREE.

14:06.172 --> 14:12.379
SO IT REALLY TUGS ON MY HEART TO
SEE HIM CAMPAIGNING TO STAY AND

14:12.413 --> 14:16.034
OTHER PEOPLE MISLEADING HIM THAT
THEY ARE VOTING FOR HIM.

14:16.068 --> 14:19.000
I KNOW I HAVE A LOT TO THINK
ABOUT.

14:19.034 --> 14:29.000
OKAY, I WILL LET YOU THINK
.

14:56.034 --> 15:01.379
I ASKED ME AGAIN FOR MY VOTE
BECAUSE HE THINKS HE HAS YOURS.

15:01.413 --> 15:09.724
I AM ONLY GOING TO BE FORCED TO
SAY BRITINI IS NOT VOTING FOR

15:09.758 --> 15:10.517
YOU.

15:10.551 --> 15:11.689
IT IS PUTTING ME IN A
POSITION.

15:11.724 --> 15:19.275
HE IS PRESSURING ME LIKE I'M THE
SWING VOTE, AND I'M NOT.

15:19.310 --> 15:24.379
HE WANTS TO YOU TELL
CHRISTIAN THAT.

15:24.413 --> 15:27.689
SHE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT ME AS
IF I AM THE SWING VOTE FOR HIM

15:27.724 --> 15:30.758
TO STAY HERE AND MY VOTE, AND
IT'S NOT MY VOTE.

15:30.793 --> 15:32.137
YOU SHOULD TELL HIM THAT.

15:32.172 --> 15:36.344
THAT'S WHY I AM SITTING HERE
TELLING BRITINI IF HE ASKED ME

15:36.379 --> 15:40.448
AGAIN I AM GOING TO LET HIM KNOW
I'M NOT THE SWING VOTE.

15:40.482 --> 15:43.827
I PERSONALLY LIKE CHRISTIAN
BETTER THAN I LIKE SARAH BETH.

15:43.862 --> 15:46.413
I AM GENUINELY CONFLICTED RIGHT
NOW.

15:46.448 --> 16:01.206
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE MY
VOTE IS GOING.

16:01.241 --> 16:08.172
SO MY MINDSET RIGHT NOW IS I
THINK I'M GOING TO GO TO EACH

16:08.206 --> 16:11.275
PERSON AND TELL THEM I DON'T
WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS

16:11.310 --> 16:12.379
ALLIANCE ANY MORE.

16:12.413 --> 16:14.448
DON'T SAY THAT.

16:14.482 --> 16:16.241
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT, PLEASE
DON'T SAY THAT.

16:16.275 --> 16:21.034
I DON'T WANT TO TWORK WITH
THIS BITCH ANY MORE.

16:21.068 --> 16:24.137
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT,
PLEASE, PLEASE, I'M BIGGING YOU

16:24.172 --> 16:24.517
PLEASE.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.689
I DON'T.

16:25.724 --> 16:28.413
TIFF ME IS TRYING TO GO OUT
THERE AND MAKE DECISIONS AND

16:28.448 --> 16:29.620
BOSS PEOPLE AROUND.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.310
AND THAT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH
ME.

16:31.344 --> 16:34.551
I DON'T LISTEN TO NO ONE XCEPT
MY MOTHER AND GOD.

16:34.586 --> 16:37.896
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED SHE IS
NOT MY MOTHER SHERRY AND SHE IS

16:37.931 --> 16:39.655
NOT GOD HIMSELF.

16:39.689 --> 16:44.551
SO SHE'S NOT GOING TO TELL ME OR
TELL PEOPLE ON MY TEAM WHAT TO

16:44.586 --> 16:48.758
DO TWNS YOU'VE GOT TO JUST HOLD
IT TOGETHER, I'M BEGGING YOU,

16:48.793 --> 16:50.000
MAN.

16:50.034 --> 16:52.758
I DON'T DO-- WITH PEOPLE THAT
TRY TO ACT LIKE THEY ARE THE

16:52.793 --> 16:53.344
BOSS.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.655
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS.

16:55.689 --> 16:59.655
NO, GIRL, YOU SITTING OVER HERE
TRYING TO PLAY PUPPET MASTER.

16:59.689 --> 17:03.482
DO I LOOK LIKE I HAVE A CLOWN
FACE ON MI FACE RIGHT NOW.

17:03.517 --> 17:07.689
PLEASE, TELL ME, SO I CAN
SQUEEZE THE RED NOSE.

17:07.724 --> 17:11.586
WE HAVE A FINAL SAY, THE
COOKOUT, WE WILL LOOK OUT FOR

17:11.620 --> 17:15.689
EACH OTHER, BUT YOU HAVE ONE
PLAYER WHO IS NOT PLAYING LIKE A

17:15.724 --> 17:18.793
TEAM PLAYER.

17:18.827 --> 17:30.379
I DON'T DEAL WITH-- BITCHES LIKE
THAT, THAT IS NOT LOYALTY, THAT

17:30.413 --> 17:31.620
SAY-- BUTCH.

17:31.655 --> 17:33.034
Julie: UP NEXT, THE COOKOUT
DIVIDE CONTINUES TO GROW, THEN

17:33.068 --> 17:37.379
THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION WILL
SEND EITHER CHRISTIAN OR SARAH

17:37.413 --> 17:42.000
BETH PACKING PLUS FIND OUT HOW
YOU AT HOME WILL BE PART OF THE

17:42.034 --> 17:43.758
NEXT BIG TWIST.

17:43.793 --> 17:44.689
STAY WITH US.

17:56.896 --> 17:59.482
WELCOME BACK TO "BIG
BROTHER," WITH CHRISTIAN ON THE

17:59.517 --> 18:02.310
BLOCK AND THE TARGET SQUARELY ON
HIS BACK.

18:02.344 --> 18:06.344
COULD HIS ONLY HOPE COME FROM AN
11th HOUR FLIP?

18:19.241 --> 18:21.482
UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK THAT
PEOPLE HAVE YOU BELIEVING THAT

18:21.517 --> 18:26.724
YOU NEED ONE MORE VOTE.

18:26.758 --> 18:30.724
I THINK YOU NEED THREE.

18:30.758 --> 18:38.758
AND NOT ONE OF THOSE JOKERS,
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY ARE

18:38.793 --> 18:43.793
TELLING YOU, ARE VOTING FOR YOU
TO STAY.

18:43.827 --> 18:47.241
YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE
TO DEEP YOU HERE, KISSIAN, AND

18:47.275 --> 18:49.793
I'M TELLING YOU THAT THEY ARE
NOT.

18:49.827 --> 18:53.896
AND I WAS THE SWING VOTE, AS
THEY HAVE YOU THINKINGK I WOULD

18:53.931 --> 18:55.793
VOTE FOR YOU TO STAY.

18:55.827 --> 18:56.482
I.

18:56.517 --> 18:59.275
I BELIEVE HAVE I TWO VOTES.

18:59.310 --> 19:02.482
I'LL NOT LYING TO YOU.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.344
BUT BIG D AND BRITINI.

19:04.379 --> 19:08.172
BIG D AND BRITINI ARE
FLIPFLOPPERS.

19:08.206 --> 19:09.344
I GET THAT.

19:09.379 --> 19:12.137
AND IF I COULD GET THEM TO FLOP
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

19:12.172 --> 19:14.896
THEY'RE GOING TO ALWAYS FLOP,
KISSIAN.

19:14.931 --> 19:15.620
THEY COULD BE NEXT.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.275
I PROVIDE THE NEXT TARGET.

19:17.310 --> 19:20.724
SO SAY I PROVIDE ANOTHER WEEK OF
SAFETY FOR YOU GUYS, SO THAT

19:20.758 --> 19:22.379
WHOLE SIDE OF THE HOUSE IS SAFE.

19:22.413 --> 19:25.827
I GOT TO THINK, CHRISTIAN,
IT'S A LOT.

19:25.862 --> 19:32.620
WHO CAN BEAT ADD.

19:32.655 --> 19:36.517
WHY DOES HE GOING HOME HOW
DOES THAT HELP YOU TAKE HIM OUT.

19:36.551 --> 19:39.620
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT T THE
MORE I REALIZE THAT KEEPING

19:39.655 --> 19:45.862
CHRISTIAN IS MORE BENEFICIAL FOR
MY GAME THAN SARAH BETH.

19:45.896 --> 19:49.275
I CAME IN THIS ROOM TO TELL
YOU THAT IT IS A NO FROM ME.

19:49.310 --> 19:54.758
BUT I'M LEAVING THE ROOM TELLING
YOU I AM VERY CONFLICTED.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.275
YOU GAVE ME A LOT.

19:56.310 --> 20:02.310
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT IT I LIKE
IT THOUGH.

20:02.344 --> 20:08.793
I AM EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY
CONFLICTED BECAUSE I PERSONALLY

20:08.827 --> 20:12.758
FEEL LIKE IF I PUSH HARD ENOUGH
I CAN GET CHRISTIAN TO STAY IN

20:12.793 --> 20:13.551
THIS HOUSE.

20:13.586 --> 20:16.275
I KNOW, I FELT THE SAME WAY
TOO.

20:16.310 --> 20:23.482
AND IT STEAMS LIKE EVERYONE
ELSE-- .

20:23.517 --> 20:25.137
THAT IS WHY I WANT TO TALK TO
YOU.

20:25.172 --> 20:27.620
WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT FOR
TALKING HIM OUT.

20:27.655 --> 20:30.206
HE IS THE STRONGEST EXETSER
AND I JUST THINK TO MYSELF THAT

20:30.241 --> 20:34.310
WE ARE STILL HAVE X THAT CAN
TAKE OUT CHRISTIAN, THAT IS WHAT

20:34.344 --> 20:35.586
I THINK.

20:35.620 --> 20:42.655
AS LONG AS HE IS HERE-- I AM
LIKE WHY WOULD WE TAKE HIS ASS

20:42.689 --> 20:49.551
OUT THIS WEEK AND KEEP SB WHO
IS-- .

20:49.586 --> 20:55.310
WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WOULD
REALLY WANT SB TO GO HOME, OKAY.

20:55.344 --> 20:57.551
NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING.

20:57.586 --> 21:04.172
YOU AND CLAIRE, ME AND ALYSSA
, BRITINI.

21:04.206 --> 21:05.827
I'M DOWN, LET'S DO IT.

21:05.862 --> 21:10.689
I HAVE JUST EXPECTED THAT
CHRISTIAN HAS TO GO HOME THIS

21:10.724 --> 21:12.862
WEEK WITH.

21:12.896 --> 21:18.068
X-ZAVIER AND ALYSSA ON BOARD, I
WOULD ONLY NEED TWO MORE VOTES.

21:18.103 --> 21:19.034
TIME TO FLIP A HOUSE.

21:19.068 --> 21:22.551
SO I REALLY THINK WE CAN MAKE
THIS HAPPEN.

21:22.586 --> 21:25.241
ALL RIGHT, CLAIRE, I'M
STRUGGLING.

21:25.275 --> 21:28.206
I'M STRUGGLING TOO.

21:28.241 --> 21:29.413
GOOD, SIT.

21:29.448 --> 21:34.000
YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
DO ABOUT KEEPING CHRISTIAN.

21:34.034 --> 21:38.620
BUT WE BOTH FEEL LIKE IT'S
BENEFIT-- BENEFICIAL TO US IF HE

21:38.655 --> 21:38.931
STAYS.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.172
YEAH.

21:40.206 --> 21:42.448
IF WE VOTE FOR HIM TO GO I
KNOW THAT YOU AND I ARE AT THE

21:42.482 --> 21:43.758
BOTTOM OF THAT OTHER SIDE.

21:43.793 --> 21:47.275
IF CHRISTIAN STAYS, IT ST WAY
BETTER FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE

21:47.310 --> 21:49.758
THEY'RE STILL COMING FOR EACH
OTHER.

21:49.793 --> 21:54.655
BETTER FOR EVERYONE OTHER
THAN.

21:54.689 --> 22:00.137
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DO YOU
WANT TO.

22:00.172 --> 22:01.275
THESE ARE MY THOUGHTS.

22:01.310 --> 22:06.896
I MEAN THE ISSUE IS I DON'T
TRUST-- I DON'T TRUST SB.

22:06.931 --> 22:09.586
THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE WORKED
WITH FOR THE LONGEST.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.551
WE DON'T TRUST.

22:12.586 --> 22:14.068
ARE WE FLIPPING?

22:14.103 --> 22:16.034
I THINK WE DO IT I THINK WE
FLIP.

22:16.068 --> 22:23.965
I THINK SO TOO.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.275
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, GO
FIND BRITINI, GO FIND BRITINI.

22:28.310 --> 22:28.965
I CAN'T GO.

22:29.000 --> 22:29.620
WHY NOT.

22:29.655 --> 22:30.758
BECAUSE I'M IN THE H.O.H.

22:30.793 --> 22:33.620
ROOM HAVING A VERY IMPORTANT
CONVERSATION WITH CLAIRE.

22:33.655 --> 22:37.103
GO FIND BRITINI AND BRING HER
TO THE H.O.H. ROOM.

22:37.137 --> 22:39.379
NOW THAT CLAIRE IS ON BOARD
WITH THIS FLIP, I WANT TO ENSURE

22:39.413 --> 22:41.758
THAT WE HAVE THAT FIFTH VOTE.

22:41.793 --> 22:49.758
I REALLY THINK THAT I CAN
CONVINCE BRITINI, THEN WE'RE

22:49.793 --> 22:55.758
GOOD TO GO.

22:55.793 --> 22:57.931
ARE YOU NEEDED.

22:57.965 --> 22:58.793
OKAY.

22:58.827 --> 23:01.482
MAY I ASK WHO IS ASKING TO
SEE HER.

23:01.517 --> 23:02.068
TIFFANY.

23:02.103 --> 23:03.137
OH, FOR WHAT REASON?

23:03.172 --> 23:04.724
JUST WONDERING.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.689
I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT IN THE
CONVERSATION.

23:06.724 --> 23:08.206
OKAY, COME ON, LET'S GO.

23:08.241 --> 23:09.758
NO, IT'S JUST HER.

23:09.793 --> 23:10.310
NO, QUESTION GO.

23:10.344 --> 23:12.344
WE CAN GO.

23:12.379 --> 23:12.862
WE'LL ALL GO TALK.

23:12.896 --> 23:13.827
I WANT TO GO.

23:13.862 --> 23:16.793
NO, WE AREN'T IN TROUBLE.

23:16.827 --> 23:18.758
YOU'RE NOT A JOKER, YOU'RE
GOOD.

23:18.793 --> 23:24.275
I DON'T LIKE WHEN SOMEONE
TRYING TO MANIPULATE SOMEONE AND

23:24.310 --> 23:25.793
BRITINI HAS BEEN A PAWN FOR
THREE WEEKS AND ARE YOU COMING

23:25.827 --> 23:31.482
IN HERE BARKING ORDERS, THAT IS
NOT GOING TO WORK FOR ME.

23:31.517 --> 23:32.379

23:32.413 --> 23:36.206

TBRITINI.

23:38.724 --> 23:42.655
OKAY.

23:42.689 --> 23:43.931

IT'S OKAY, NO WORRIES.

23:54.551 --> 24:01.172
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.724

WHO DID I SAY I WAS LOOKING
FOR.

24:10.758 --> 24:11.586
BRITINI.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.344

BRITINI.

24:13.379 --> 24:16.655
BIG D TO COME LIKE BODY GUARDS

PAGE, WE SHOULD ALL BE ABLE TO

33:32.310 --> 33:33.758

AFTER THE SHOW.

33:33.793 --> 33:36.310
I DISCUSSED IT WITH HER, I
DON'T KNOW WHERE WE STAND AT THE

33:36.344 --> 33:40.896
MOMENT BUT SHE SAYS I AM HER
GIRLY DPIRL THARK IS WHAT SHE

33:40.931 --> 33:43.379

FIRL.

33:43.413 --> 33:44.827

33:44.862 --> 33:46.827
YES, I WANT SOMETHING AFTER
THIS, FOR SURE.

33:46.862 --> 33:49.068

POTENTIALLY WOULD BE A LONG

33:49.103 --> 33:51.758

THE GAME, SHALL WE.

33:54.068 --> 33:55.793
I HAVE TO HAND IT TO YOU.

33:55.827 --> 33:58.724
YOU REALLY FOUGHT HARD TO STAY
IN THE HOUSE.

33:58.758 --> 34:00.310
THAT WAS THREE DAYS, THREE
DAYS STRAIGHT.

34:00.344 --> 34:04.344
Julie: YEAH, I MEAN NONSTOP
SO YOU GET AN A PLUS FOR EFFORT.

34:04.379 --> 34:06.896
BUT ULTIMATELY WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU COULDN'T TURN THE TIDE TO

34:06.931 --> 34:08.620
YOUR FAVOR?

34:08.655 --> 34:11.034
I WAS, I HAD THE NUMBERS
DPENS ME.

34:11.068 --> 34:13.172
PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE LIKE TO
PULL OUT NUMBERS.

34:13.206 --> 34:17.206
WITH 57 PERCENT WINNING STREAK
WITH ALL THE COMPS, ONCE I WAS

34:17.241 --> 34:21.620
UP THERE, IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO I
WAS SITTING NEXT TO, THEY FIGURE

34:21.655 --> 34:23.827
THIS IS THE TIME TO TAKE A SHOT
AT ME BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW

34:23.862 --> 34:26.655
IF THEY COULD GET ANOTHER
OPPORTUNITY DOWN THE LINE SO --

34:26.689 --> 34:27.896
I DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

34:27.931 --> 34:30.793
Julie: LET ME SHED SOME
LIGHT ON SOME OTHER AREAS YOU

34:30.827 --> 34:32.655
MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF.

34:32.689 --> 34:36.620
BECAUSE YOU WERE IN THE ROYAL
FLUSH WITH AMONGST OTHERS THE

34:36.655 --> 34:38.620
CURRENT HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD, DEREK
X.

34:38.655 --> 34:39.827
UH-HUH.

34:39.862 --> 34:42.310
Julie: AND HE TOLD YOU IF
THE VETO WAS USED, HE THAT WAS

34:42.344 --> 34:45.620
NOT GOING PUT UP AS A
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

34:45.655 --> 34:46.103
RIGHT.

34:46.137 --> 34:46.448
Julie: HE LIED.

34:46.482 --> 34:47.103
HE DID.

34:47.137 --> 34:48.586
Julie: AND HERE YOU SIT.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.827
EXACTLY.

34:49.862 --> 34:53.793
Julie: NOW THE MOMENT DEREK
WON H.O.H., HE WAS GUNNING FOR

34:53.827 --> 34:56.689
YOU BECAUSE OF THAT RECORD YOU
JUST SPOKE OF.

34:56.724 --> 35:00.689
DO YOU RESPECT HIS GAME MOVE.

35:00.724 --> 35:04.275
I DO BECAUSE IT IS A SHOT I
SHOULD HAVE TAKEN LAST WEEK WHEN

35:04.310 --> 35:05.896
I WAS H.O.H.

35:05.931 --> 35:10.275
SO I RESPECT IT IN THE SENSE
THAT HE DID WHAT WAS BEST FOR

35:10.310 --> 35:14.206
HIS GAME, BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE
THAT SAME SHOT FOR HIM.

35:14.241 --> 35:16.827
BUT I THINK THAT IT WAS NOT A
SMART DECISION BECAUSE HE'S

35:16.862 --> 35:20.689
GOING TO GO OUT MUCH SOONER THAN
IF I STAY AROUND.

35:20.724 --> 35:23.241
Julie: WE STILL HAVE A LOT
OF SHOW TO GET TO IT SO I NEED

35:23.275 --> 35:27.896
TO ASK YOU YOUR FINAL THOUGHTS.

35:27.931 --> 35:29.862
REALLY, I'M EXCITED I HAD
THIS OPPORTUNITY.

35:29.896 --> 35:32.034
AND I REALLY DIDN'T COME FOR THE
MONEY.

35:32.068 --> 35:35.310
I CAME TO MAKE SOME GOOD FRIENDS
AND I DID.

35:35.344 --> 35:37.241
AND I ACTUALLY REALLY CAME TO
PLAY.

35:37.275 --> 35:41.965
SO I WAS MOST UPSET WHEN I
COULDN'T PLAY IN THE-- BECAUSE I

35:42.000 --> 35:44.275
WANTED TO COMPETE.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.517
I AM GLAD I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.

35:45.551 --> 35:47.344
Julie: YOU WON FIVE
COMPETITIONS IN 37 DAYS SO YOU

35:47.379 --> 35:48.482
SHOULD GO HOME VERY HAPPY.
