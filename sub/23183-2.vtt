00:10.733 --> 00:13.966
One of your dogs was being a
degen the other day...

00:14.000 --> 00:15.900
What's up, what's up...

00:15.933 --> 00:18.266
Don't let the dog
lick your boot.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.200
Off you go. Way y'go.
Way y'go. Way y'go.

00:22.666 --> 00:26.900
‐What's the problem?
‐Your boots are covered in piss.

00:26.933 --> 00:29.200
Are you accusing me of washing
my boots in the toilet again?

00:29.233 --> 00:31.033
All dudes' shoes are
covered in piss.

00:31.066 --> 00:33.066
From standin' in front of the
toilet or a urinal.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.666
Your stream hits the water or
the porcelain and it goes
fuckin' everywhere.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.200
‐Prove it.
‐No, he's right.

00:38.233 --> 00:41.066
Have you ever taken a look at
the area half a foot in fronts
of a urinal?

00:41.100 --> 00:42.666
It's like a miniature swamps.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.166
Ants could ride
sea‐doos through it.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.633
Ants can't ride
no sea‐doos.

00:45.666 --> 00:47.766
Of course ants can't ride
no sea‐doos!

00:47.800 --> 00:49.600
Just don't let the dog
lick your boots.

00:49.633 --> 00:53.766
I mean not to be an expert on
the subject, 'cause of course,
everybody's a fuckin' expert.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.866
Everybody's a fuckin' expert.
Must be nice.

00:55.900 --> 00:58.066
You know, when I was coming
up we'd be lucky to even
have a dog.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.266
Now everyone's a fuckin' expert.
Must be nice.

01:00.300 --> 01:03.933
You guys notice that whenever
there's a problem everybody
turns into a dog expert?

01:03.966 --> 01:05.566
We oughtta leave
this world behind.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.633
Maybe they could.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.266
‐Maybe who could?
‐Ants.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.200
‐Could what?
‐Ride sea‐doos.

01:19.033 --> 01:20.166
Good buddy?

01:20.200 --> 01:22.900
See, there's a lot of variables
at play here, obviously.

01:22.933 --> 01:25.933
But if you ask me if I've heard
crazier things than
ants riding sea‐doos...

01:26.900 --> 01:27.933
I'd say sure.

01:27.966 --> 01:28.866
You'd need a scientist.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.366
You'd need a team
of scientists, I think.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.900
Well, ants are smart
enough to walk single file
and protect their queen.

01:33.933 --> 01:36.533
So, you know, they're just a
stone's throw away from
humans intelligence‐wise.

01:36.566 --> 01:38.633
They're a hop, skip and a jump,
if you really think about it.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.300
You get a scientist to make
a sea‐doo for an ant?

01:40.333 --> 01:43.900
Well, I think a team of
scientists, a good one,
for sure could.

01:43.933 --> 01:46.733
A scientist making
sea‐doos for ants
would be a tireless job.

01:46.766 --> 01:47.966
Thankless, likely, too.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.666
Well, you operates the gas
with your thumb on the
sea‐doo so,

01:50.700 --> 01:53.300
ants don't got thumbs.
That right there is
your first obstacles.

01:53.333 --> 01:56.866
No, you'd have to get
scientists to make the
gas a push button

01:56.900 --> 01:58.300
so the ant could just
put his foot on it.

01:58.333 --> 02:01.033
It's like if a team of
scientists was building
a sea‐doo for an ant,

02:01.066 --> 02:04.766
they could likely just as easily
build the ant a bionic thumb
to operate the gas with.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.066
So, there's options there.

02:06.100 --> 02:09.700
Yeah. Ant would need a license
to operate a personal
watercraft.

02:09.733 --> 02:12.633
That's not a big deal.
You can get that
over the weekend.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.166
But the scientists would
have to build them a PFD

02:14.200 --> 02:15.600
because they wouldn't let them
take the course without it.

02:15.633 --> 02:18.700
Ants would have no problem
stabilizing themselves
out on the sea‐doo

02:18.733 --> 02:20.800
on accounts that they got more
arms and legs than we do.

02:20.833 --> 02:23.166
They've got a leg up on us
there, if you wants to be
clever about it.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.000
If I'm an ant I'm operating the
sea‐doo with my antennas.

02:26.033 --> 02:29.100
That way I've got all those arms
and legs to stabilize myself
on the machine,

02:29.133 --> 02:31.966
which you'd need like,
if it's a wavy day on the water.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.133
It'd still take a lot of
concentration from an ant.

02:34.166 --> 02:37.100
Like Dan's gonna fall off two
or three times when
he gets going.

02:37.133 --> 02:38.233
So it's just trial and error.

02:38.833 --> 02:39.900
I don't know.

02:41.066 --> 02:42.233
You don't know what?

02:42.266 --> 02:44.900
Well, think about
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

02:44.933 --> 02:49.000
Think about how helpful and
resilient the ant was
the entire journey.

02:49.033 --> 02:50.866
Well, know what, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it,

02:50.900 --> 02:53.100
the kids might never have got
un‐shrunk if it weren't
for the ant.

02:53.133 --> 02:56.100
That's all well and good,
but I'm actually quite surprised
you guys would suggest that the

02:56.133 --> 03:00.100
ants would just up and abandon
his post protecting the queen to
go ride on sea‐doos.

03:00.133 --> 03:01.633
Well, you don't know that
ant, Dan.

03:01.666 --> 03:03.000
You know nothing about
the ant, Dan.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.933
That's rather presumptuous
of youse.

03:04.966 --> 03:06.966
You're an ant comin' up in a
tough neighbourhood.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.533
Never caught a break
in your life.

03:08.566 --> 03:12.600
All of a sudden there's a team
of scientists outside your door
with a sea‐doo.

03:12.633 --> 03:14.866
Dan, look me in the eye
right now and tell me
you don't ride it.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.600
The ant's buddies would be
thrilled to help him out.

03:16.633 --> 03:18.600
They'd happily cover his shift
protecting the queen.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.066
An opportunity like that?
They'd be linin' up
around the anthill.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.500
How many more opportunities
like that you think the
ant's going to get?

03:24.033 --> 03:25.633
Not many.

03:25.666 --> 03:27.633
That's the first ant in the
colony to ride a sea‐doo.
That's his legacy.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.700
They'd be talking about that
ant inter‐colonial.

03:29.733 --> 03:31.200
Fire ants wouldn't
fuck with him.

03:31.233 --> 03:32.800
He rides sea‐doos.

03:32.833 --> 03:34.600
‐What's the alternative?
‐Yeah, what's the alternative?

03:34.633 --> 03:36.066
Work on an ant farm?

03:36.100 --> 03:38.833
That ant's got a life on the
outside, he's got to live it
God dammit.

03:38.866 --> 03:40.066
His hours might have got cut.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.933
He might have mouths to feed.
You don't know.

03:41.966 --> 03:43.966
His wife's thinking about
leaving, taking the kids too.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.866
I was out of line.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.866
Well, good people make
mistakes, Dan.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.600
Yeah, it's all right. Just...
just like,

03:49.633 --> 03:53.000
I don't know, like, down the
road, I think, if you hear
somebody talkin' about somebody

03:53.033 --> 03:55.200
that they don't really know,
you'll swiftly correct them.

03:55.233 --> 03:58.533
I think it's important that they
just learn something here.

03:58.566 --> 04:00.700
Not to be an expert,
'cause everybody's
a fuckin' expert.

04:01.666 --> 04:02.800
Must be nice.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.800
Can you get me some
sour candies?

04:25.733 --> 04:26.966
Sure, Katy‐Kat.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.033
You got him well trained,
don't ya?

04:40.566 --> 04:44.100
Wayne, how'r ya now. Not s'bad.
Good 'n you? Now... now hold on,
Wayne, Wayne.

04:44.133 --> 04:46.133
Wayne, we aint' got time for the
pleasantries, all right?

04:46.166 --> 04:49.000
Youse guys heard what the hockey
coach is up to at the
golf course?

04:49.033 --> 04:50.300
Fuck golf.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.100
Fuckin' ankle sock wearin'
sallies, that's all I know.

04:52.133 --> 04:53.466
That fuckin' twat

04:53.500 --> 04:56.700
says there's too much shits from
Canada Gooses on the
golf course.

04:56.733 --> 04:58.800
There's too much shit from
Canada Gooses everywhere.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.300
Just keep your dog out of it
and keep walkin'.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.133
Exactly. But get this.

05:02.166 --> 05:05.000
To curb the amount of shits from
Canada Gooses,

05:05.033 --> 05:07.933
that degenerate son‐of‐a‐bitch
has put the wheels in motion

05:07.966 --> 05:10.233
to oil and grease up the eggs!
Hot Jimmy!

05:10.266 --> 05:12.633
What the fuck ya talkin' about
oil and grease up the eggs?

05:12.666 --> 05:14.266
They track down the
Canada Gooses nests,

05:14.300 --> 05:16.600
put oil on Canada Gooses eggs
so they won't hatch.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.166
‐Oh!
‐(ALL) What?!

05:18.200 --> 05:23.133
So mother Canada Gooses sit on
their eggs and wait diligently
for them to‐‐

05:23.166 --> 05:25.033
Hatch, but they never hatch.

05:25.066 --> 05:27.066
Canada Gooseslings die
inside the egg.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.200
What?!

05:28.233 --> 05:29.700
What?!

05:29.733 --> 05:30.766
What?!

05:30.800 --> 05:31.866
What?!

05:31.900 --> 05:33.966
I've never been so irate in
my whole fuckin' life!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.733
You fuck with mother nature!
You don't fuck with it,
cocksucker.

05:36.766 --> 05:38.233
You don't fuck with motherhood!

05:38.266 --> 05:40.900
There's a special place in
heaven for animal lovers,
that's all I know.

05:40.933 --> 05:42.166
Those are fuckin' Canada Gooses.

05:43.666 --> 05:45.533
Those are Canada's fuckin'
gooses.

05:45.566 --> 05:47.800
Canada Gooses are majestics.

05:47.833 --> 05:50.833
Barrel‐chested.
The envys of all ornithologys.

05:50.866 --> 05:53.266
They are leaders.
Born and bred leaders.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.133
Canada Gooses are
van‐fuckin'‐garde.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.200
Avant‐fuckin'‐garde.

05:56.233 --> 05:57.933
Guardians of the fuckin' galaxy!

05:57.966 --> 05:59.900
You wanna know what? You got a
problem with Canada Gooses,

05:59.933 --> 06:02.600
you got a problem with me,
and I suggest you let that
one marinate.

06:02.633 --> 06:05.633
Now coach is an expert on
Canada Gooses.
Must be fuckin' nice!

06:05.666 --> 06:07.966
When I was comings up you'd be
lucky to even have
Canada Gooses.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.033
Now we got so manys you want to
start killin' their babies.
Must be fuckin' nice.

06:12.066 --> 06:13.766
You guys ever notice

06:13.800 --> 06:17.200
that as soon as there's a
problem around here everybody
starts killin' Canada Gooses?

06:17.233 --> 06:18.400
We oughtta leave this
world behind.

06:18.433 --> 06:21.933
Canada Gooses mate for life.
They're just like you and me.

06:21.966 --> 06:24.300
Those cocksuckers help each
other fly when they're
in the air.

06:24.333 --> 06:25.900
They look out for each other.

06:25.933 --> 06:27.300
Now you wanna kill them for
takin' shits.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.233
You know, I saw two Canada
Gooses mount a swan one time

06:30.266 --> 06:32.633
and you gotta think that swan
told her friends about it.

06:32.666 --> 06:34.066
You're goddamn right she did.

06:34.100 --> 06:37.266
I think we all need to take a
good look in the mirror
and ask ourselves,

06:37.300 --> 06:40.266
where we would be without
Canada Gooses.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.266
We cannot allows this to happen.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.833
We will not allow
this to happen.

06:44.866 --> 06:47.600
I'm about ready to put some
anthrax in the fuckin' mail
here, that's all I know.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.900
ooh! Settle down, baby.
Settle down.

06:49.933 --> 06:52.600
Hey! Let's hit the golf course!

06:58.000 --> 06:59.800
‐Hey. Hey, buddy.
‐Oh, hey, buddy.

06:59.833 --> 07:02.000
You, uh, throwin' some weights
around, eh?

07:02.033 --> 07:03.633
Beastin' it up.

07:03.666 --> 07:05.233
Nice. Muscle confusing.

07:05.266 --> 07:06.733
Progressive overloading.

07:06.766 --> 07:07.966
Gettin' yolked.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.166
Gettin' yolked.

07:09.200 --> 07:14.266
Nice. Could use a spot every now
and then, though, you know.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.166
Could use a spot sometimes too.

07:18.333 --> 07:19.533
But I'm... I'm fine, though,
man. Like, I'm good.

07:19.566 --> 07:23.200
Oh, yeah. No, I'm good, dude.
Super good, man. Thanks for...

07:28.033 --> 07:29.100
Sweet...

07:30.100 --> 07:31.700
Who brought the rockets, boys?

07:31.733 --> 07:34.133
Whose billet brothers are
fuckin' rockets, boys?

07:34.166 --> 07:35.900
I'll celebrate your biscuit all
night, bud.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.033
Ever gone bar upski?

07:37.066 --> 07:38.366
Fag.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.833
How'd you know your dad's
safe word when I fist
his ass, bud?

07:40.866 --> 07:42.766
We got real dirty with
his dangle, bud.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.866
I fucked your dad with
chapped lips and a runny nose.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.866
Fucked your dad with bad bread
and B. O.

07:48.666 --> 07:50.166
Olympic rules in this
shoot‐out boys.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.933
Order of shooters is me, me,
me and then me, again.

07:53.966 --> 07:55.266
I'm fuckin' T. J Oshie.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.600
You've never seen a two‐way
centre‐man with jam
like this, boys.

07:58.633 --> 08:01.933
Let's see some jam, boys.
Let's see you jam it
right up there.

08:01.966 --> 08:03.266
You need a pest on your roster?

08:03.300 --> 08:04.833
I'm a shit disturber.

08:04.866 --> 08:06.533
I'll disturb your shit
all night.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.533
Wanna play some Chel?

08:12.566 --> 08:14.733
I should... I should really get
back to Katy, buddy.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.833
Good call.

08:16.866 --> 08:19.633
Man, she makes me do stuff for
her like all the time.

08:19.666 --> 08:24.933
I'll play Chel with you, buddy.
Let's hit that A button.
Ay, ay, ay, ay...

08:24.966 --> 08:29.833
If he gets tired I'll be right
there to hit ay, ay, ay, ay,
for him.

08:31.066 --> 08:33.266
I'll cover his point... any day.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.166
Must be nice.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.933
Thank you. I am very good.

08:42.966 --> 08:44.933
So, ladies and gentlemen of the

08:44.966 --> 08:49.866
Letterkenny Grey Granite Copper
Crick Whistle Ridge
Golf & Country Club,

08:49.900 --> 08:53.066
goose droppings will no longer
be impeding our play on this
lovely course.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.233
Thank you. Thank you.

08:55.266 --> 08:58.133
Now let's hit the links!

08:58.166 --> 09:01.666
Has someone around here got a
problem with Canada Gooses
takin' Canada deuces?

09:03.100 --> 09:05.200
Must be nice!

09:05.233 --> 09:07.933
When I was comings up we'd be
luck to even have oils for
our tractors.

09:07.966 --> 09:11.800
Now you got so much of it you
want to pour it on eggs.
Must be fuckin' nice!

09:11.833 --> 09:14.633
Whenever anybody's got a problem
these days it's straight to
dumpin' oil on it.

09:14.666 --> 09:15.733
We oughtta leave this
world behind.

09:15.766 --> 09:17.833
Wanna know what? You got a
problem with Canada Gooses,

09:17.866 --> 09:21.200
you got a problem with me and I
suggest you let that
one marinate.

09:21.233 --> 09:24.900
Leave the egg painting to the
Easter Bunny, you pile of shit!

09:26.600 --> 09:29.600
Your wardrobe colour scheme
looks like a bi‐polar spell!

09:30.700 --> 09:32.600
Get those cocksuckers
off your feet!

09:32.633 --> 09:35.600
‐Pardon?
‐The ankle socks,
you fuckin' sally.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.633
How does your wife let you leave
the house lookin' like that,
huh?

09:37.666 --> 09:39.533
My wife died three years ago.

09:39.566 --> 09:42.300
Yeah, well, one look at you and
it's clear she's in a better
place now, you fuckin' asshole!

09:42.333 --> 09:46.700
Look! The oiling of goose eggs
was approved by the board,
all right?

09:46.733 --> 09:48.700
And a fine board it is.

09:48.733 --> 09:52.800
So your little breaking‐glass
display is not going to work.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.833
That's why we have a new by‐law
that prohibits glass bottles.

09:55.866 --> 09:58.700
So all of you are going
to get fined.

09:58.733 --> 10:03.933
Fine my balls, you fuckin'
dandy. Fine 'em and suck 'em
while you're at it, you chooch!

10:03.966 --> 10:06.233
I will do neither of those
things, good sir.

10:06.266 --> 10:09.000
There's a special place in
heaven for animal lovers,
that's what I always say.

10:09.033 --> 10:12.066
Yes. And those animals will now
have a special place in heaven,
as well.

10:12.100 --> 10:15.766
Along with my wife, Barbara.
So, let's hit the links!

10:16.600 --> 10:17.800
Fuckin' embarrassing.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.933
I'm ready to drive my car
into a crowd.

10:21.966 --> 10:23.766
Just calm down, baby.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.000
Let's get to work on getting the
Canada Gooses off the
golf course.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.933
We have some coyote decoys
in the shed.

10:28.966 --> 10:30.966
Worked for that golf course off
the Maitlands River.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.533
Uh‐hm, it'll work here too.

10:32.566 --> 10:35.800
‐Pitter‐patter.
‐We'll get to work on getting
ankle socks off the golf course.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.500
‐Ain't that right, baby.
‐Uh‐hm.

10:38.133 --> 10:39.500
Let's do this!

11:09.866 --> 11:11.266
‐'Sup boys?
‐Nothing.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.833
You?

11:12.866 --> 11:14.300
Nothin'

11:14.333 --> 11:17.600
I'm not doing a whole lot of
anything these days.

11:17.633 --> 11:22.066
Oh. Oh. Be my altar boy, man.
Be my altar man.

11:22.100 --> 11:27.000
The Lord worketh dayeth and
nighteth in his battle to
castaway heathenethses.

11:27.033 --> 11:30.200
That's a lot of work for the
Lordeth alone. The Lord could
useth some helpeth

11:30.233 --> 11:32.833
in his fight against the
heathensetheseses...

11:32.866 --> 11:35.533
No! The Lordeth have all the
help in the world.

11:35.566 --> 11:39.600
And all they want is your money
anyway. Join us.

11:40.566 --> 11:42.666
Connect. Conjugate.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.866
Coalesce.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.600
‐I'm not really religious, boys.
‐That'll do.

11:47.633 --> 11:50.066
‐Have nothing really against it,
though.
‐That'll do.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.700
Can't we all just hang out?

11:51.733 --> 11:52.866
(ALL) No!

12:00.100 --> 12:03.600
Coyotes. The most obnoxious
predators of rural Canadas.

12:03.633 --> 12:06.533
The town'll still give you
sixty‐five bucks a tail for
pickin' 'em off.

12:06.566 --> 12:10.166
To kill coyotes is okay.
Coyotes'll raid your hen house.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.300
Coyotes attack your livestock,
too. You don't see no Canada
Gooses steal with nobody,

12:13.333 --> 12:14.833
good or bad.

12:14.866 --> 12:16.533
No. You know what
Canada Gooses do?

12:16.566 --> 12:20.000
Canada Gooses help the people
who what's stolen from.
That's what Canada Gooses do.

12:20.033 --> 12:22.066
Tell you what, if you're
accusing Canada Gooses
of stealing,

12:22.100 --> 12:24.833
you're accusing me of stealing
and I suggest you let
that one marinate.

12:24.866 --> 12:27.600
Let's get real here. Coyote
decoys work on Canada Gooses,

12:27.633 --> 12:31.333
but there's not a coyote on
planet Earth who wants nothin'
to do with no Canada Gooses.

12:31.366 --> 12:35.500
Lions is lucky Canada Gooses
don't migrate to Africa.
Then they'd be's extinct.

12:35.533 --> 12:38.966
The only animal in the animal
kingdom what wants anything to
do with Canada Gooses

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
is Canada Mooses.

12:40.033 --> 12:42.000
Well, Mike Tyson had
a pretty good
run of things.

12:42.033 --> 12:43.100
Do you wanna know why?

12:43.133 --> 12:44.633
No Canada Gooses
in his weight class.

12:44.666 --> 12:47.200
Don't you remember
when that plane had to land
on the river in New York

12:47.233 --> 12:48.800
'cause Canada Gooses
flew into the engine?

12:48.833 --> 12:51.866
It's 'cause Canada Gooses
likely had intel there was
a pedophile or two

12:51.900 --> 12:53.866
on board and took matters
into their own hands.

12:53.900 --> 12:54.966
As they should!

12:55.000 --> 12:56.200
No innocent
people hurt either.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.033
You think that's a fluke?
You tell me that's a fluke.

12:58.066 --> 12:59.333
Go ahead and try
and tell me that's a fluke.

12:59.366 --> 13:00.433
You try to tell me
that's a fluke right now.

13:00.466 --> 13:03.533
Okay, look!
No Canada Gooses
on the golf course

13:03.566 --> 13:06.266
means no eggs to be oiled.
Animal cruelty avoided.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.766
Fuckin' eh.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.966
You know, when I was comin' up
you'd be lucky to even have
any animals.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.833
Now you got so many animals
you wants to be cruel to them?

13:11.866 --> 13:12.866
Must be fuckin' nice!

13:12.900 --> 13:14.466
Any time anybody's got
a problem these days

13:14.500 --> 13:16.400
it's straight to being
cruel to animals.

13:16.433 --> 13:18.000
We gotta leave
this world behind.

13:18.033 --> 13:20.966
Keep it movin'.
I wanna get some sun today
and there's still lots to do.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.400
For Canada Gooses?

13:22.433 --> 13:23.800
ALL: Anything!

13:25.866 --> 13:27.333
MAN: Quack! Who's that?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.066
Fuckin' embarrassing.

that divot there, asshole?

13:38.433 --> 13:40.600
I got a pitch for you.
Go fuck yourself.

13:40.633 --> 13:41.766
That's impressive.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.433
Heard you were
sexually harassing
all the beer‐kart girls.

13:44.466 --> 13:46.600
Well, we have
a beer‐kart boy
in this club so...

You're on Canada Gooses land.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.466
You better fix that divot
'cause Canada Gooses
would fix it for you.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.866

in heaven
for friggin' animal lovers,

‐Um‐hmm.

contrariness in character

14:16.033 --> 14:18.200
and concerning contrast
in conduct.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.500
Disturbing disparity
in demeanour.

Don't be redundant, Roald.

Oh my God,
I just woke up.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.333

Do you enjoy gaming?

14:26.566 --> 14:27.600
‐Yeah.
‐Dancing.

‐Do do.
‐Oh, Lord, did you hear it?

It's the voice of an angel.
I think the choice
is clear. Just do it!

‐But... gaming!
‐Gaming.

Cheese?

15:09.033 --> 15:11.433
Yes. Cheese.

15:11.466 --> 15:16.300
Everyone knows
cheese is the milk of Christ.

You've hit the motherlode
of cheesie yumminess
when you pick Christ.

15:19.966 --> 15:21.600
It's a classic.
Bread, wine, cheese.

15:21.633 --> 15:24.900
And also cured
in salted dried meats.

‐See Corinthians!

to keep coming into town

18:47.866 --> 18:50.866
I got a whole bag
of sour candies for you
so you can put 'em in a big jar

18:50.900 --> 18:54.033
and put 'em on the counter
it's just... just for you,
Katy‐Kat.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.533
Oh, no I wanted
the sour jellybeans.

18:57.566 --> 19:01.400
Okay, but I just drove
all the way to town
and... and back. So, uh‐‐

19:01.433 --> 19:05.166
Well, maybe Jonesy
can pick them up.
Or is Jonesy gone?

19:05.200 --> 19:09.300
(ECHOING)
Jonesy gone...
Jonesy gone...

19:09.333 --> 19:13.033
Jonesy gone...
Jonesy gone...
Jonesy gone...

19:13.066 --> 19:16.300
‐No!
‐No?

19:16.333 --> 19:19.900
No. No. I'll... I'll...
I'll go get...
I'll go get them.

19:19.933 --> 19:22.433

20:09.200 --> 20:11.466

20:11.500 --> 20:14.366
‐(GLASS SHATTERS)
‐So, if I start taking shits
on your golf course

20:14.400 --> 20:17.866
you can start killing my babies
'cause it's exact same thing
with Canada Gooses.

20:17.900 --> 20:21.266
‐It's exact same thing.
‐Aw, it's fuckin' embarrassing!

20:21.300 --> 20:23.600
‐(GLASS SHATTERS)
‐And how do you thinks
Evil Knievel's made all them

20:23.633 --> 20:26.900
dare devil jumps there,
shitty John Daleys,
Canada Gooses.

20:26.933 --> 20:28.900
Letting them into
their jet streams,
that's how.

20:28.933 --> 20:30.300
That... that is not true.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.533
The same thing goes
for Evil Knievel Junior
and Travis Pastrana.

20:32.566 --> 20:34.566
They owe everything
they have to Canada Gooses.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.233
‐It's not true!
‐(GLASS SHATTERS)

20:36.266 --> 20:37.666
And most people
don't know this

20:37.700 --> 20:41.866
but Canada Gooses
were the deciding factor
in the 1995 Quebec referendum.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.466
They kept
this country together.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.933
‐(GLASS SHATTERS)
‐You got a problem
with animal lovers,

20:45.966 --> 20:48.866
you got a problem with me
and I suggest
you let that one marinate.

20:48.900 --> 20:52.900
Fine! Fine!
The Geese‐‐

20:52.933 --> 20:54.466
‐Gooses!
‐(GRUNTS)

20:54.500 --> 20:57.266
I will call off the oiling
of the Goose eggs, all right,

20:57.300 --> 20:59.233
if you will leave
this golf course, all right,

20:59.266 --> 21:01.433
and let the members
of the Letterkenny

21:01.466 --> 21:04.033
Grey Granite Copper Creek

21:04.066 --> 21:08.300
Whistle Ridge Golf
and goddam Country Club,

21:08.333 --> 21:10.900
play this game in peace!

21:13.033 --> 21:17.033
‐Do we have your word?
‐You have my word!

21:17.066 --> 21:20.300
Then come look me in the eye
and shake my fuckin' hand.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.933
Hop to it!

21:22.966 --> 21:24.566
Get movin',
Tiger stripes Woods.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.366
Horizontal stripes
are never flattering.

21:30.166 --> 21:33.866
Thank fuckin' Christ,
am I happy to leave
this fuckin' Goose factory.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.100
‐Holy shit
do you hack it up...
‐Unreal.

21:36.133 --> 21:38.100
Get some ankle socks,
you dick head.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.333
Come on, come on,
come on, replace those divots.

21:40.366 --> 21:42.300
Those Canada Gooses
will do it for you...

21:42.333 --> 21:44.466
The fuckin' grass grows ...

21:46.133 --> 21:49.900
Go for an Arnold Palmer...

21:49.933 --> 21:55.233
You know, it's hard not to have
Canada Gooses backs when they're
so close to us as humans.

21:55.266 --> 21:59.000
Male Canada Gooses help female
Canada Gooses.

21:59.033 --> 22:00.100
They're fuckin' hammered, eh?

22:01.600 --> 22:04.000
It's pretty hard to believe that
Canada Gooses

22:04.033 --> 22:07.000
are still labelled a pest
species in most rural areas.

22:07.033 --> 22:10.866
Well, if the shoe fits, wear it.
If the truth hurts,
bare it, bud.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.900
I'll always root for
the underdog.

22:13.933 --> 22:17.033
The Canada Gooselings are pretty
cute when they hatch though,
right?

22:17.066 --> 22:18.533
Well, no arguments there,
good buddy.

22:18.566 --> 22:19.966
Fuckin' eh.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.933
Have you ever seen how Canada
Gooses stray feathers floatin'
on water?

22:22.966 --> 22:26.866
They're not even like other bird
feathers that get all
waterlogged and shit.

22:26.900 --> 22:31.033
No. They're aerodynamic.
Aqua‐dynamic.

22:31.066 --> 22:35.300
It's almost like ants could use
their feathers as racing as
kayaks or some shit...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.166
Ants racing on kayaks, baby.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.833
Of course they can't, ants can't
race no kayaks, honey.

22:44.300 --> 22:45.533
But maybe they coulds.
