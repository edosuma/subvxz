00:00.001 --> 00:02.794
As a matter of fact, it is very European.

00:02.827 --> 00:04.273
- You know?
- I just don't...

00:04.312 --> 00:05.903
In France, they don't.

00:05.955 --> 00:07.859
You know, the kids aren't
shaving now, either,

00:07.909 --> 00:10.970
which is amazing because
they've finally caught up to me.

00:11.005 --> 00:13.143
- Yeah, well...
- They shave everything.

00:13.205 --> 00:15.601
All of Max's friends, they shave...

00:15.636 --> 00:17.025
I don't like it.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.718
- Everything off the down...
- I don't like it.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.855
- On the front bottom.
- The downstairs.

00:21.909 --> 00:24.631
And they're armpit hair... Mine
is nothing compared to theirs.

00:24.685 --> 00:26.587
Theirs is like this.

00:26.637 --> 00:27.976
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

00:28.054 --> 00:32.590
Legs, armpit hair, everything they keep,

00:32.668 --> 00:34.225
and no bushes.

00:34.259 --> 00:36.128
They all look like Barbies.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.398
You used to walk around,
and it was upsetting to me.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.610
Did I really?

00:41.674 --> 00:44.189
Yes. I have images that
are burned into my head.

00:44.251 --> 00:46.673
- Oh, please let's not talk about it.
- I don't like the things...

00:46.750 --> 00:48.018
Shall we not?

00:48.141 --> 00:49.932
- Oh, dear me.
- Well, you know,

00:49.992 --> 00:52.475
you could have thrown on
a skirt once in a while.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.868
Your father liked it, though.

00:53.915 --> 00:55.947
- Oh, can... No.
- No, no, no.

00:55.980 --> 00:56.801
La, la, la, la.

01:01.836 --> 01:04.806

- Ride a cock-horse.

With rings on her fingers
and bells on her toes,

Did anything happen?

Did you two do stuff?

01:42.834 --> 01:45.383
<i>No, we just hung out.</i>

01:45.443 --> 01:47.383
Honey, you did things.

01:55.225 --> 01:56.944
<i>I know, but I realize that</i>

01:56.990 --> 01:58.979
I was using him for sex.

01:59.038 --> 02:02.126
I knew what I was getting
into. I know about it... Him.

02:03.348 --> 02:05.591
I want to...

02:05.633 --> 02:08.051
You know, I want to have
something real with you.

02:09.443 --> 02:10.673
Really?

02:12.968 --> 02:15.911
It's a mutual thing,
I don't care about him,

02:15.946 --> 02:17.481
he doesn't care about me.

02:35.212 --> 02:36.215
But wait.

02:38.582 --> 02:40.117
Do you...?

02:40.151 --> 02:41.733
Do you have a condom?

02:42.901 --> 02:45.538
Uh...

02:47.627 --> 02:48.646
No.

02:50.654 --> 02:52.800
We totally used condoms.

02:52.954 --> 02:54.857
No, you didn't.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.134
No, you didn't, Sam.

02:57.168 --> 02:59.561
Yes, we did.

02:59.621 --> 03:01.672
Okay, you want to keep
pretending you did, go ahead.

03:01.748 --> 03:02.882
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:03.775 --> 03:05.477
What's going on with you?

03:05.509 --> 03:07.545
With, like,
Grant's-his-name?

03:07.886 --> 03:09.548
Ugh, nothing.

03:09.688 --> 03:11.549
I got rid of that loser.

03:11.769 --> 03:12.772
Good.

03:14.786 --> 03:16.615
Honey, no.

03:16.679 --> 03:18.770
Let me suck your dick,
I'll get out of your hair.

03:20.191 --> 03:23.157
<i>I miss you. When are you
coming to see the girls?</i>

03:23.207 --> 03:24.685
I miss you, too.

03:28.035 --> 03:30.130
Sam, this is totally awesome.

03:30.165 --> 03:31.949
I can't believe we're
gonna see Joe Walsh live.

03:32.007 --> 03:33.344
I am...

03:33.428 --> 03:35.602
Freaking our tits off!

03:35.637 --> 03:37.077
I know!

03:37.166 --> 03:39.414
- Did I do good? Did I do good?
- Yeah, you did good.

03:39.449 --> 03:41.626
- Yes, my sweet.
- Yes!

03:41.661 --> 03:43.204
- Hi, hi.
- Hi.

03:43.239 --> 03:45.753
We have these, so can we please?

03:45.816 --> 03:47.450
Okay. Go on in.

03:47.508 --> 03:49.578
- Thank you.
- They can't drink.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.582
Yeah, we know.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.834
- Ooh, we can't drink!
- We can't drink.

03:53.889 --> 03:56.333
- You can't drink.
- You can have a sip of mine.

03:56.411 --> 03:58.764
- I'm gettin' a beer.
- Oh, we're fine, Mommy.

03:58.853 --> 04:00.220
Thanks. You guys should
go get your beers, though.

04:00.268 --> 04:03.305
Sam, you are my second
mom. I can't believe this.

04:03.340 --> 04:06.472
I've literally been obsessed with
Joe Walsh since I was, like, seven.

04:06.540 --> 04:07.418
Thank you, thank you.

04:07.491 --> 04:09.255
Oh, honey, you're welcome.

04:09.334 --> 04:11.829
Oh, also, my parents want you guys
to come over for a family dinner soon.

04:11.864 --> 04:13.938
Oh, my God, yes, Mom, we have to. Please.

04:13.990 --> 04:15.803
Who are you telling? I want to more.

04:15.857 --> 04:17.149
This is nervous.

04:17.182 --> 04:18.783
Oh, it's okay, honey, just breathe.

04:18.817 --> 04:20.515
Yeah. Okay.

04:20.588 --> 04:21.512
- Hi.
- Hello.

04:21.572 --> 04:24.539
Hi, can we get on the floor with these?

04:24.588 --> 04:26.580
Uh, no, you need a bracelet.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.749
Oh. Can you maybe make an
exception and just be nice?

04:29.784 --> 04:32.027
Mm, I'm sorry, love.

04:32.211 --> 04:34.687
Really? Okay.

04:34.771 --> 04:36.630
You know what? I totally understand.

04:36.685 --> 04:38.636
- You're doin' your job.
- Yep.

04:38.697 --> 04:40.196
- Yeah.
- Respect that.

04:40.438 --> 04:42.473
- Okay.
- Hey, hang on.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.377
Ain't you that lady
from that therapist show?

04:45.410 --> 04:46.645
Yes.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.037
- Right?
- This is her.

04:48.096 --> 04:50.764
Yeah. Couple years ago. Yeah, that was me.

04:50.799 --> 04:52.629
That was crazy shit.

04:52.664 --> 04:55.433
- Oh, cool. Thank you.
- Nice.

04:55.552 --> 04:58.423
So, still no on the floor?

04:58.646 --> 05:01.551
Yep. Still no on the floor. Sorry, love.

05:01.598 --> 05:02.894
Okay, bye.

05:02.929 --> 05:04.092
See ya.

05:06.130 --> 05:07.584
I'm sorry, you guys.

05:07.653 --> 05:09.279
I really wanted to get you on the floor,

05:09.314 --> 05:11.761
but this is cool, right?

05:11.796 --> 05:14.463
- This is nice.
- Yeah. You're so sweet, and you're really cute,

05:14.538 --> 05:16.707
but we're gonna try and get
on the floor before they start.

05:16.740 --> 05:18.616
You guys have fun, okay?

05:18.651 --> 05:20.459
I love you guys. I'll see you after.

05:20.518 --> 05:23.187
But they're not gonna let you
on the floor, honey, with those.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.025
Thank you. Thank you.

05:27.764 --> 05:28.984
I was never that.

05:29.059 --> 05:30.821
- Huh?
- I was never, never that.

05:30.884 --> 05:31.898
No.

05:31.953 --> 05:34.917
I didn't even know how
to try to get into things.

05:34.952 --> 05:36.830
I wore my brother's hand me downs.

05:36.885 --> 05:39.026
I didn't even give a crap how I looked.

05:39.105 --> 05:41.735
I just like... I was a friggin' fat shit,

05:41.805 --> 05:45.396
and I just sort of shoved my tits in
the faces of people who would look.

05:45.457 --> 05:46.915
Or touch.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.211
How come she didn't even
want a sip of my beer?

05:49.254 --> 05:52.396
Because, honey, they are vaping
their faces off at the moment.

05:52.434 --> 05:53.296
- Oh, yeah.
- I know.

05:53.331 --> 05:55.496
- Okay, fine, you want to get drunk?
- Yes.

05:55.531 --> 05:57.882
Oh, no, but I have this. Wait.

05:57.944 --> 05:59.550
Wait. Hold, please.

05:59.584 --> 06:01.375
I have devil.

06:01.477 --> 06:03.840
Jesus, Macy, throw that away.

06:03.895 --> 06:05.541
- Stop it.
- I'm not throwing it away.

06:05.604 --> 06:06.558
Sorry, Mom.

06:08.522 --> 06:10.103
- Don't throw it away.
- I'm not throwing it away.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.478
It's great to be back here at the Avalon.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.127
I love it here.

06:14.255 --> 06:16.977
Uh, we-we've had some
great, great times here.

06:17.012 --> 06:19.847
I... I don't remember a lot about that,

06:19.882 --> 06:24.394
but, uh, my band tells me we
just had a great time here.

06:24.749 --> 06:28.445
And so here we go. Enjoy.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.863
Whoa. So sorry about that.

06:35.925 --> 06:38.924
Oh, it's okay. That's
what vodka is clear for.

06:38.985 --> 06:40.958
At least we're sanitized.

06:42.781 --> 06:45.517
Hey. You look familiar to me.

06:45.574 --> 06:48.318
That's 'cause I go out
to clubs every night.

06:48.356 --> 06:51.058
No. Do you know who you look like?

06:51.138 --> 06:52.493
Jillian Michaels.

06:52.582 --> 06:54.835
- Ooh, yeah.
- You have her vibe.

06:54.913 --> 06:55.939
Oh.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.925
My name is Aaron.

07:01.995 --> 07:03.348
Oh. Oh!

07:03.380 --> 07:06.153

07:48.386 --> 07:49.426
- What?
- Isn't this great?

07:49.488 --> 07:50.897
Don't I take you to fun things?

07:50.960 --> 07:52.631
Yes, Mom, thank you. What?

07:52.693 --> 07:53.830
We have really good spots right up front.

07:53.876 --> 07:57.327
Well, I just wanted you guys to meet
J.J., and this is his friend Aaron.

Hi.

08:05.304 --> 08:06.273
Hi.

08:07.089 --> 08:10.174
Um... We're gonna go.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.170
Thanks, Mom, see you later.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.641
Where the hell is Macy?

08:18.696 --> 08:21.458
Mom, don't even. I can't believe you.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.649
What did I do?

08:29.517 --> 08:31.205
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

08:31.993 --> 08:33.671
Paisley blew Aaron.

08:34.484 --> 08:36.467
Did Paisley blow Aaron?

08:36.503 --> 08:39.551
I think Paisley blew Aaron,
and I introduced everybody,

08:39.586 --> 08:42.166
- and it was all very awkward.
- Mom.

08:43.506 --> 08:44.842
Mom!

08:46.527 --> 08:48.665
So I guessed it. Right?

08:49.323 --> 08:50.723
I think I'm right.

08:51.875 --> 08:53.965
I know I'm right, too.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.539
Oh, my God.

08:57.024 --> 08:59.443
That's why you're upset. Paisley...

08:59.907 --> 09:01.537
I am so sorry.

09:01.576 --> 09:05.195
It's okay, Sam, but
please don't tell my mom.

09:05.265 --> 09:06.969
Of course not.

09:07.004 --> 09:10.530
Honey, I'm so sorry, I get it.

09:10.600 --> 09:15.138
And if it's any consolation, I
see people I blew all the time.

09:15.281 --> 09:16.959
We all live in the same town.

09:17.336 --> 09:18.462
Really?

09:18.777 --> 09:20.577
Oh, my God, I never thought about that.

09:20.648 --> 09:23.108
Jesus Christ, Mom. Just stop.

09:23.143 --> 09:24.733
No, it's okay.

09:25.217 --> 09:29.615
I mean, you can either
live with it, or not go out.

09:30.208 --> 09:31.741
Or blow less people.

09:32.510 --> 09:34.576
But this is more fun, to go out, right?

09:34.611 --> 09:36.089
- Yeah.
- Going out's fun.

09:36.134 --> 09:36.867
Yeah.

09:37.848 --> 09:40.384
Okay. Good girl.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.102
Okay, the Lyft's here.

09:44.324 --> 09:46.526
I think Macy's in the bathroom.

09:46.561 --> 09:47.874
Sorry.

09:52.023 --> 09:54.586
Hey. Hey, Max, Max.

09:54.672 --> 09:55.231
It's okay.

09:55.265 --> 09:57.617
- No, it's not okay.
- Yes, it is.

09:57.652 --> 10:02.282
Your mom's hard core,
yeah, but she's so real.

10:02.343 --> 10:04.646
Like, she talks to me.

10:05.244 --> 10:08.411
And she notices things, and she cares.

10:08.827 --> 10:11.629
Not like my mom would
ever talk to me like that.

10:11.739 --> 10:14.772
Like straight up without freaking out.

10:15.550 --> 10:19.023
Or you can just talk to me.

10:19.703 --> 10:20.984
No.

10:22.468 --> 10:23.988
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.581
Come on.

10:33.022 --> 10:34.758
- Eww. Yeah.
- Eww.

10:34.803 --> 10:37.164
Yeah, I know.

10:37.199 --> 10:38.981
I'm gonna go now. Mom's calling.

10:39.016 --> 10:42.712
Oh, Lordy. Right, goodbye, lovely.

10:42.746 --> 10:45.015
- Boys.
- Bye.

10:45.048 --> 10:46.319
Hey, I'll tell my dad you said hi.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.284
That's so funny that you know him.

10:48.692 --> 10:50.690
Don't tell him in front of your mom.

10:53.093 --> 10:55.077
Bye, Jillian Michaels.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.088
Yeah, bye.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.271
He was so cute.

10:58.306 --> 10:59.731
Oh, Jesus.

10:59.795 --> 11:02.211
Oh, they also definitely

11:02.274 --> 11:04.420
look a lot older than I think they are.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.760
- So that's the plus.
- Okay.

11:05.806 --> 11:08.287
They're very like all jobs-having men...

11:08.322 --> 11:11.324
- Yeah, Lyft is here.
- I'm very, very confused.

11:11.364 --> 11:12.909
- Okay, but one thing.
- Yes, one.

11:12.943 --> 11:15.934
Did you blow that kid's dad?

11:15.973 --> 11:16.864
Yes, sir, I did.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.907
- Yeah.
- And yes, sir, I have.

11:18.977 --> 11:20.351
Yeah, I thought so.

11:20.386 --> 11:22.761
So you're, like, Eskimo
sisters with Paisley.

11:22.796 --> 11:24.210
- No. I'm not.
- That's awesome.

11:24.245 --> 11:26.959
Not really, because we
didn't touch the same dick.

11:27.029 --> 11:30.165
I actually... Well, I
touched its father's dick.

11:31.138 --> 11:32.492
- So I was...
- So you're like...

11:32.570 --> 11:35.448
You're like blowing Eskimo
mother and daughter with Paisley.

11:35.483 --> 11:37.865
- Yeah.
- You finally had a kid.

11:37.900 --> 11:38.935
Good.

11:38.970 --> 11:41.905
Oh, my God. You know, they
should do a genealogy show

11:41.940 --> 11:44.931
about who blew who and
who shtupped who, like...

11:44.966 --> 11:48.233
sexual activities connected
through the generations.

11:48.268 --> 11:50.472
Yeah. Wow, God, I have a cluster headache.

11:50.521 --> 11:51.559
I do. It's woozy.

11:51.613 --> 11:53.158
It's okay. It's okay.

11:53.193 --> 11:55.144
- We gotta get you home.
- Hey, man.

11:55.222 --> 11:57.055
Get her some chamomile tea.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.928
With a lot of hot sauce in it.

11:59.001 --> 12:01.735
It's the best thing for a double headache.

12:08.804 --> 12:10.700
<i>No one would take it.</i>

12:10.766 --> 12:15.644
<i>The Jews, the vets, the gays.</i>

12:15.730 --> 12:19.035
They all rejected it and said
it was too big for their, like,

12:19.151 --> 12:21.707
showrooms or stores.

12:21.793 --> 12:24.719
Oh. The divorce table.

12:24.798 --> 12:26.362
<i>He had to have it.</i>

12:26.464 --> 12:28.342
<i>I didn't want it, I paid for it,</i>

12:28.416 --> 12:31.043
<i>and guess who is now
literally stuck with it?</i>

12:31.078 --> 12:32.580
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

12:33.151 --> 12:34.991
Yeah. This is too big.

12:35.026 --> 12:37.633
And people don't really like, uh,

12:37.668 --> 12:39.594
shabby chic stuff anymore.

12:39.641 --> 12:41.429
They can't turn it around.

12:41.495 --> 12:43.864
What? This table is amazingly gorgeous.

12:43.901 --> 12:46.638
It's not shabby chic. What even is that?

12:46.815 --> 12:49.887
I can get rid of it for
you. Do you want me to?

12:49.998 --> 12:51.667
Yes.

12:51.829 --> 12:54.215
200 bucks I'll take it to the dump.

12:54.814 --> 12:57.890
What? Me pay you?

12:57.937 --> 13:01.761
You want me to pay you
$200 to take it to the dump,

13:01.824 --> 13:03.465
which you're not, I mean,

13:03.513 --> 13:04.859
what do you have, like, a warehouse

13:04.898 --> 13:07.801
where you take people's shit
that they want to give away?

13:08.360 --> 13:10.772
Yes, that's what's going to happen.

13:10.968 --> 13:12.248
Oh.

13:12.283 --> 13:13.783
So you sell it.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.709
And you make crazy cash.

13:15.803 --> 13:19.602
Well, that's really... I mean, wow.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.426
Oh, you know what? I am so sorry

13:26.499 --> 13:28.096
to drag you guys out here for nothing,

13:28.146 --> 13:30.955
but I think I'm gonna keep it.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.571
I don't want to part with it.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.508
But, you know what? I
have something for you.

13:41.563 --> 13:43.643
You're here. I have something for you.

13:43.696 --> 13:45.519
I have... Here.

13:45.581 --> 13:47.893
I have books. I have some books.

13:48.045 --> 13:51.214
Um, like, there's...
Some of these are vintage.

13:51.249 --> 13:55.292
And, uh, you guys can totally sell these.

13:55.332 --> 13:57.770
You can sell the shit
out of these if you want.

13:57.805 --> 14:01.852
Here. Here. Take. Good. Nice.

14:01.935 --> 14:03.240
There ya go.

14:05.217 --> 14:07.177
Also, I... Oh!

14:07.263 --> 14:08.764
I have a chicken.

14:09.418 --> 14:10.386
I have a chicken.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.111
Oh! I have three chickens in here,

14:13.168 --> 14:14.503
and I don't know how to defrost,

14:14.562 --> 14:16.848
and I would love to give you one. Okay?

14:16.947 --> 14:18.482
Nice? Good?

14:21.977 --> 14:25.889
Yes, we will take two of
the chickens and the books.

14:25.924 --> 14:28.633
That's great. I'm so happy.

14:28.722 --> 14:31.199
I'm happy to give you these,

14:32.032 --> 14:35.887
because, seriously, I
don't know how to defrost.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.842
Uh, at all.

14:37.916 --> 14:41.637
Okay, thank you guys. So nice to meet you.

14:41.672 --> 14:46.383
Thank you. But can I just
ask you guys one thing.

14:46.477 --> 14:48.170
Where are you from?

14:48.424 --> 14:50.404
I'm from Bulgaria.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.594
Oh. Cool.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.971
I don't know that part of the world at all.

14:55.006 --> 14:56.875
North of Greece.

14:56.910 --> 14:58.983
So, do you cook?

14:59.018 --> 15:02.099
I have always been cooking.
My father taught me.

15:03.134 --> 15:06.015
So how are you gonna cook that,

15:06.050 --> 15:07.321
the chicken?

15:07.551 --> 15:09.777
I have a way of cooking chicken

15:09.812 --> 15:13.014
that makes the meat fall off the bones.

15:21.906 --> 15:23.450
Hi, guys. Hi.

15:23.505 --> 15:27.372
Um, I was wondering...
I just need two guys.

15:27.784 --> 15:30.453
Two to do a little bit of work.

15:30.526 --> 15:33.701
You know, for maybe, like,
50 bucks or something.

15:33.736 --> 15:35.523
Two of you guys?

15:35.613 --> 15:37.582
All right, great. How are you?

15:37.855 --> 15:40.270
No, no, no, you can, uh, follow me.

15:40.305 --> 15:41.776
In your car. Right?

15:41.841 --> 15:44.368
No, señora. We don't have a car.

15:44.489 --> 15:45.240
Oh, shit.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.691
Hey.

15:46.726 --> 15:47.830
Hey.

15:49.298 --> 15:50.965
I have a car.

15:51.217 --> 15:52.804
I can follow you.

15:55.229 --> 15:56.275
To where?

15:56.878 --> 15:58.315
Your house?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.554
Thank you so much.

16:22.377 --> 16:24.780
Girls. Come down.

16:24.815 --> 16:26.497
Help me carry things.

16:26.558 --> 16:29.140
We're eating outside.

16:32.547 --> 16:33.815
We're really eating outside?

16:33.850 --> 16:35.588
- Yeah.
- Yay!

16:35.623 --> 16:36.791
Yay!

16:36.826 --> 16:40.752
Max. Frankie. Come on, dinner.

16:41.303 --> 16:44.130
Mom, I have too much homework.
Can I just eat in my room?

16:44.263 --> 16:46.318
No. Please come down.

16:46.389 --> 16:48.363
Get your sister.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.963
This is very annoying!

17:02.018 --> 17:04.887
I made dinner and it used to be hot!

17:16.932 --> 17:18.181
Here, you want to take these?

17:18.215 --> 17:19.248
Sure.

17:20.236 --> 17:22.621
Thank you. Hello. Jesus!

17:22.686 --> 17:23.954
What, Mom?

17:24.025 --> 17:26.703
I made chicken. I got a new way to make it.

17:26.738 --> 17:28.705
- Mm?
- Where are we eating it, out front?

17:28.740 --> 17:30.504
No. In the backyard.

17:30.539 --> 17:31.478
Go.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.765
Here, you want to take these? You got 'em?

17:33.809 --> 17:35.311
Don't drop 'em.

17:35.901 --> 17:36.831
Oh!

17:40.329 --> 17:41.806
I know, we did that
when we were at Altared.

17:41.841 --> 17:43.103
I've done that with my friends before.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.797
- Dry your teeth first.
- Mom.

17:44.954 --> 17:46.135
Who are those guys?

17:46.213 --> 17:47.614
That's Herman and Paul.

17:47.684 --> 17:50.473
They helped me move the dining
table, they're staying for dinner.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.551
- It's fine.
- Mom, that's really weird.

17:52.586 --> 17:54.032
- No.
- Mom, that's really sweet.

17:54.098 --> 17:55.414
Thank you.

17:55.487 --> 17:57.169
- I'm excited. Hi, guys.
- Hi.

17:57.213 --> 17:59.282
Outdoor dining table. Isn't this fun?

17:59.317 --> 18:00.939
Isn't it gonna get ruined out here?

18:00.989 --> 18:02.415
- Who cares? Let's live.
- Yeah, whatever.

18:02.450 --> 18:04.653
I'm sick of it being in the garage.

18:04.688 --> 18:06.771
This is nice.

18:06.860 --> 18:09.523
- Nan! Hi.
- I heard lots of voices and I thought...

18:09.586 --> 18:10.993
I must just come and see what's happening.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.363
- Yeah. Join us.
- How are you, Grandma?

18:13.409 --> 18:15.883
I... I mean, I know I'm
not asked, but I could...

18:15.918 --> 18:17.464
I could maybe sit there, couldn't I?

18:17.499 --> 18:19.584
Absolutely. I'm happy you're here.

18:19.619 --> 18:22.431
Are you? Darling, look, look.
