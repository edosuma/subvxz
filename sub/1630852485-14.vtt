CASHIER (over speaker):
<i> Howdy. Welc... Big Ol...</i>

00:05.397 --> 00:07.914
-(static over speakers)
-Um, yeah, howdy.

00:08.067 --> 00:10.492
Can I get a bacon
ranch burger with tots?

00:10.511 --> 00:13.070
-Get me the spicy chicken.
-A spicy chicken.

00:13.163 --> 00:14.013
And what did you decide, hon?

00:14.089 --> 00:15.180
I'm thinking it's a nuggets day.

00:15.332 --> 00:17.407
Oh, 9- or 12-piece?

00:17.409 --> 00:19.092
You know what,
I feel like being bad.
Make it 12.

00:19.245 --> 00:22.246
And a 12-piece nugget,
please and thank you.

00:22.264 --> 00:25.082
CASHIER:<i> ...burg,</i>
<i> spicy chick... and nugs.</i>

00:25.100 --> 00:26.099
<i> Anything else?</i>

00:26.252 --> 00:27.751
Not sure.
Can you repeat that back?

00:27.753 --> 00:30.696
CASHIER:<i> I got it, sir.</i>
<i> Just pull up to the window.</i>

00:36.904 --> 00:39.020
-That'll be $38.90.
-Oh!

00:39.098 --> 00:42.499
$38.90? Boy, that inflation
is no joke, huh?

00:48.198 --> 00:50.365
-It's all there, sir.
-Oh, no offense,

00:50.384 --> 00:52.384
but, uh, we've just
learned the hard way.

00:52.536 --> 00:54.386
Trust, but verify.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.613
Ah. Ah!

00:56.615 --> 00:59.391
Looks like we only have
a 9-piece nugget here.

00:59.468 --> 01:02.452
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well,
I ordered a 12-piece.

01:02.454 --> 01:04.271
No, you said 9.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.399
No, I'm positive I said 12.

01:07.626 --> 01:10.143
But with that squawk box
of a speaker you guys have--

01:10.220 --> 01:12.813
Look, I already
charged you for 9.

01:12.965 --> 01:14.573
Anyways, we're out of nugs.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.077
You're out of nugs?

01:18.228 --> 01:19.912
You're telling me
in that whole restaurant,

01:20.063 --> 01:21.972
these are the last 9 nuggets?

01:21.974 --> 01:23.231
Al, sweetie, it's no biggie.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.491
Yeah, Dad.
Seriously. Chill.

01:24.568 --> 01:27.086
No, I am chill, Brian,
and it is a big deal.

01:27.237 --> 01:29.329
You ordered 12 nuggets
you deserve 12 nuggets.

01:29.481 --> 01:32.499
We're not leaving until my wife
gets three more nuggets.

01:32.651 --> 01:34.167
Sweetie, this really
isn't worth it.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.819
It's not like
I really need them anyway.

01:35.821 --> 01:37.096
She really doesn't, man.

01:39.934 --> 01:40.841
Wh... what did you say?

01:40.993 --> 01:42.101
(car horn honking)

01:42.344 --> 01:44.085
-CASHIER: Nothing, man.
-Can we just please go, Al?

01:44.163 --> 01:45.162
No, no, no, no, no.

01:45.164 --> 01:47.164
You said she-she really doesn't.

01:47.182 --> 01:48.348
She-she really doesn't what?

01:48.442 --> 01:50.867
She doesn't need
any more nuggets.

01:50.869 --> 01:52.686
-JOY: Al!
-BRIAN: Dad!

01:52.762 --> 01:55.697
(theme music plays)

01:56.766 --> 01:58.492
(horn blaring)

02:04.291 --> 02:05.290
What happened exactly?

02:05.367 --> 02:06.941
This lunatic
lunged at my employee.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.276
He tried to come
through the window,

02:08.354 --> 02:10.379
and now he's stuck
clogging up my dinner rush.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.631
-Oh.
-Nancy.

02:13.025 --> 02:15.300
Tell him to stop yanking on him.
They're gonna break a rib.

02:15.377 --> 02:16.543
Hey, you guys, you need to leave

02:16.695 --> 02:18.211
the yanking to
the professionals. Thank you.

02:18.288 --> 02:20.722
Paul, Marjan, get some cribbing
underneath the legs.

02:22.201 --> 02:24.476
-What's your husband's name?
-Al.

02:26.054 --> 02:27.354
Excuse us.

02:28.056 --> 02:29.539
Excuse us.

02:29.541 --> 02:30.983
Hey.

02:31.134 --> 02:33.152
Al, how are ya?
Owen. This is Tommy.

02:33.228 --> 02:34.728
We're gonna get you
out of there.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.213
Oh, please and thank you.

02:36.231 --> 02:37.898
Hey, Al, this is my friend TK.

02:38.050 --> 02:39.158
He's gonna check your vitals.

02:39.385 --> 02:41.160
Hey, I need you to tell me,
are you in any pain?

02:41.236 --> 02:42.327
Do you think
you've broken anything?

02:42.554 --> 02:45.722
Other than my dignity,
I-I-I think I'm okay.

02:45.724 --> 02:48.909
But I'll be hearing about this
from the wife for a long time.

02:49.061 --> 02:51.670
She says I have
an anger problem.

02:51.821 --> 02:54.080
Hey, those are nuggets.

02:54.233 --> 02:55.323
I knew it, liar!

02:55.401 --> 02:56.824
-TOMMY: Al. Al.
-AL: No, no.

02:56.919 --> 02:58.010
Do you see the nuggets?

02:58.161 --> 02:59.327
They said they were
outta nuggets.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.013
That's how
this whole thing started.

03:01.089 --> 03:02.088
You're a liar!

03:02.165 --> 03:03.998
Al. Keep your heart rate down.

03:04.076 --> 03:05.075
-Liar!
-OWEN: Whoa!

03:05.093 --> 03:06.259
Hey, hey.
They're not gold nuggets.

03:06.336 --> 03:07.594
Marjan, why don't you
get the silicone?

03:07.671 --> 03:09.413
-Yep.
-Tell Judd and Paul
to do the same.

03:09.431 --> 03:11.023
-MATEO: Copy, copy.
-OWEN: Uh, hey, listen, man.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.026
Uh, your wife might be
onto something here
with this anger thing.

03:14.177 --> 03:16.086
You ever thought about
getting professional help?

03:16.088 --> 03:17.421
Oh, you sound like her.

03:17.514 --> 03:19.013
Well, maybe you
oughta listen to her.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.590
No shame in getting help.

03:20.592 --> 03:21.591
I did.

03:21.610 --> 03:23.518
-You-you went to therapy?
-Hmm.

03:23.595 --> 03:24.928
I don't believe that.

03:24.947 --> 03:25.871
Oh, believe it.

03:26.022 --> 03:26.872
For a while there,
he was punching

03:27.023 --> 03:28.189
more people
than Russell Crowe.

03:28.267 --> 03:30.459
Would you guys
focus on your work?

03:33.380 --> 03:35.121
Man, these pants are
really soaking up the lube.

03:35.274 --> 03:36.215
Hey, don't use the whole thing.

03:36.366 --> 03:38.442
I ain't even cover
half his booty yet.

03:38.460 --> 03:41.478
Okay, back up, please.
Back up. Back up.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.280
Thank you. Back.
Thank you. Thank you.

03:43.298 --> 03:45.557
God, he's gonna go viral again.

03:45.709 --> 03:47.951
This is almost as bad
as Six Flags.

03:47.953 --> 03:49.119
What happened at Six Flags?

03:49.137 --> 03:51.230
We don't talk about Six Flags.

03:51.381 --> 03:54.716
Alright, we're gonna
rock him back and forth gently
and then we're gonna pull,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.384
we're going to get him
out of here. On my count.

03:56.462 --> 03:58.812
-MATEO: Okay.
-One, two, three.

03:58.888 --> 04:00.030
(Al screams)

04:02.301 --> 04:03.467
-Ow, ow! Stop, stop!
-OWEN: Okay.

04:03.485 --> 04:06.370
Stop, stop, stop.
We don't have enough lube.

04:07.397 --> 04:08.305
(groans)

04:08.415 --> 04:10.640
Well, this night
couldn't get any worse.

04:10.659 --> 04:12.325
OWEN: Okay. Um, Marjan,
get the Sawzall.

04:12.402 --> 04:14.086
-We're gonna have to
cut him out of here.
-Yup.

04:14.237 --> 04:16.329
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.

04:16.331 --> 04:18.498
-Who's gonna pay for that?
-Insurance.

04:18.575 --> 04:19.407
And if it doesn't?

04:19.485 --> 04:21.485
You sue him later for damages.

04:21.503 --> 04:23.428
Wait. Sue? Sue who?

04:23.655 --> 04:24.654
Oh, I can't afford that.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.523
I got a kid going off
to college in the fall.

04:26.525 --> 04:28.642
Please. There's gotta be
some other way.

04:32.848 --> 04:34.314
Is that lard?

04:36.926 --> 04:39.444
Really grease him up.

04:39.521 --> 04:42.022
Judd, get plenty of lard
on his behind.

04:42.174 --> 04:43.991
(onlookers laugh)

04:45.101 --> 04:47.344

could get worse.

I'm so embarrassed.

05:17.209 --> 05:18.466
No judgments. I've been there.

05:18.544 --> 05:22.487

05:45.161 --> 05:46.753

I'll tell you what, Tommy Vega,

06:01.511 --> 06:03.937
birthday manicures
is where it's at.

06:04.089 --> 06:05.364
(baby talk)

You partying too?

(both laugh)

06:08.760 --> 06:09.534
TOMMY: You know what?

06:09.928 --> 06:11.277
I figured they were
too old for ponies,

06:11.354 --> 06:12.762
too young for strippers.

06:12.764 --> 06:15.448
(Judd laughing)

06:15.601 --> 06:17.692
They do look like they're
having fun, though, right?

06:17.769 --> 06:19.527
Yeah, they're having a ball.
What'd you mean?

06:19.605 --> 06:22.964
Well, it's their first birthday
without their dad, so...

06:25.886 --> 06:27.201
This is where the party's at?

06:27.221 --> 06:29.170
EVIE AND IZZY:
Uncle Julius!

06:29.205 --> 06:31.948
JULIUS:
Double trouble! Ohh!

06:31.950 --> 06:32.982
How are my girls?

06:32.984 --> 06:34.300
Oh, hell, no. No.

06:34.453 --> 06:36.302
That man did not just
walk into my house.

06:36.379 --> 06:38.379
Is this
the infamous Uncle Julius?

06:38.399 --> 06:40.065
JUDD:
This Charles' baby brother.

06:40.142 --> 06:41.382
I can't believe
I haven't met him yet.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.309
Oh, you're not going to
today either.

06:43.462 --> 06:45.795
-Oh, watch this.
-T, T, T, hang on. Just--

06:45.797 --> 06:46.813
I'm not gonna make a scene.

06:46.965 --> 06:48.532
Okay? Alright.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.470
-EVIE: Look!
-(Tommy chuckles)

06:53.472 --> 06:56.081
-Uncle Julius came.
-I see that.

06:56.232 --> 06:58.324
-Hi, Tom.
-I didn't know you were in town.

06:58.477 --> 06:59.492
Got in last night.

06:59.828 --> 07:03.146
The band has clubs lined up here
for the next six weeks.

07:03.148 --> 07:04.981
-TOMMY: Hmm.
-You should come.

07:04.983 --> 07:06.666
And you should have called.

07:06.818 --> 07:09.577
I... I tried, but...

07:09.655 --> 07:12.580
the only number
I have is Charles' old one.

07:12.658 --> 07:14.824
You know what,
we're just so glad
that you decided to stop by.

07:14.826 --> 07:17.677
It's so great.
Girls, say goodbye
to your Uncle Julius.

07:17.829 --> 07:18.845
-Goodbye?
-TOMMY: Mm-hmm.

07:18.922 --> 07:20.013
He just got here.

07:20.089 --> 07:21.665
Oh, I know,
but he's here for work

07:21.683 --> 07:23.166
and his band's waiting for him.

07:23.168 --> 07:25.185
They have to rehearse 'cause,
you know, he's got gigs.

07:25.337 --> 07:28.113
He can stay for a little while,
Can't you, Uncle Julius?

07:28.190 --> 07:30.657
Please. It's our birthday.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.492
(mouthing)

07:33.954 --> 07:35.028
Come on, Tom.

07:35.180 --> 07:38.515
Let's just make today
about my nieces.

07:38.533 --> 07:40.942
It doesn't have to be
about whatever...

07:41.019 --> 07:42.352
bad blood is between us.

07:42.370 --> 07:44.129
Oh, honey,
I don't have bad blood.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.614
No, my blood's good. It's up.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.968
And you abdicated
all of your uncle privileges

07:50.119 --> 07:53.388
when you decided to
skip on their father's funeral.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.725
Say goodbye.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.646
(inhales and exhales deeply)

08:01.798 --> 08:03.148
Your mama's right.

08:03.299 --> 08:04.390
I got folks waiting,

08:04.467 --> 08:08.445
but nobody more important
than y'all.

08:10.807 --> 08:13.658
Happy birthday. Twice.

08:13.735 --> 08:14.743
Double trouble.

08:29.158 --> 08:31.009
(bell ringing)

08:31.995 --> 08:33.637
-Hey, Juddy.
-Hey, T.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.975
How are you feelin' today?

08:39.669 --> 08:42.020
Good. Yeah.

08:42.247 --> 08:45.431
Is there a, is there a reason
why I shouldn't be?

08:45.584 --> 08:47.025
Well, no.
I know you got pretty turned

08:47.176 --> 08:50.195
when, uh, Julius
showed up at the party.

08:50.346 --> 08:54.032
Well, yeah, I did
for about ten minutes.

08:54.183 --> 08:55.942
And then I didn't
think about him again.

08:56.094 --> 08:58.870
I mean, the girls
sure seemed excited.

08:58.947 --> 09:00.896
Well, of course.

09:00.898 --> 09:02.098
I mean, he's a musician.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.284
He brings
expensive gifts, right?

09:04.360 --> 09:08.104
He has the emotional capacity
of a, of a fifth grader.

09:08.123 --> 09:10.364
He makes the perfect playmate.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.942
I mean, the only thing is,
he's only shown up to play,

09:12.944 --> 09:15.220
what, like, four times
in 11 years?

09:16.464 --> 09:19.132
Hey, sometimes,
sometimes it's better like that.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.467
Like, uh, every time
my cousins from Georgia

09:21.544 --> 09:23.210
would come and visit,
it was that way, you know.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.897
We didn't see 'em much,
but when we did,
it was big-time.

09:25.974 --> 09:27.732
Yeah, well, this is different.

09:27.884 --> 09:29.809
I gotta protect my girls.

09:29.961 --> 09:31.552
That sounds a little harsh.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.239
'Cause I remember Charles
telling me one time that,

09:34.316 --> 09:35.965
you know, the guy
was a little flaky,

09:35.967 --> 09:37.300
but that he had a good heart.

09:37.302 --> 09:40.153
Oh, that's because
he could charm Charles

09:40.305 --> 09:42.972
almost as easily
as he could charm their parents.

09:42.974 --> 09:44.991
Just guess that's a gift

09:45.068 --> 09:47.419
of being
a sunshine child, right?

09:47.570 --> 09:50.163
I mean,
there ain't nothin' wrong
with being a sunshine child.

09:50.315 --> 09:52.073
Come on,
what are you talkin' about?

09:52.092 --> 09:53.483
No, no, you're-you're...

09:53.501 --> 09:56.261
-You're one of the good ones.
-Mm-hmm.

09:56.338 --> 09:59.489
Look, their parents
had Julius so late in life

09:59.491 --> 10:01.600
that they really just
didn't have the energy

10:01.751 --> 10:02.750
to keep up with him.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.493
He didn't have rules.

10:03.511 --> 10:04.919
He didn't have curfew.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.347
He never had to clean up
his own messes.

10:07.423 --> 10:10.350
That was left
for his older brother.

10:10.426 --> 10:12.402
Who never complained about it.

10:14.673 --> 10:15.930
No.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.264
Charles never complained.

10:17.342 --> 10:18.450
Charles always forgave him.

10:18.601 --> 10:21.119
But I can't even imagine
what Charles would think

10:21.196 --> 10:23.455
if he knew that his own brother

10:23.606 --> 10:25.582
didn't bother
coming to his funeral.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.947
Hey, Cap, you have a sec?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.190
OWEN:
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

10:34.192 --> 10:35.375
What can I do for you?

10:35.527 --> 10:37.135
Oh, it's not about
what you can do for me.

10:37.362 --> 10:39.471
It's what you did for lard ass.

10:39.547 --> 10:40.713
Lard ass?

10:41.049 --> 10:43.049
You know the dad
from the drive-thru
the other night?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.142
Yeah, I guess some people

10:44.293 --> 10:45.718
have taken to
calling him lard ass

10:45.871 --> 10:47.312
'cause we had to lard up...

10:47.422 --> 10:48.888
-His ass.
-MARJAN: Yep.

10:48.965 --> 10:50.373
By the way, that is very mean.

10:50.392 --> 10:52.725
Oh, you're right.
You are absolutely right.

10:52.802 --> 10:54.986
And I will tell Mateo that.

10:55.138 --> 10:56.729
So what's going on
with lard ass?

10:56.973 --> 11:00.233
Nothing. Nothing.
Uh, we were just saying
how impressed we were with,

11:00.385 --> 11:03.720
you know, how you talked to him
about therapy and stuff.

11:03.722 --> 11:05.646
Well, you know, I've always
thought that this job

11:05.666 --> 11:09.392
is about more than heroic saves
and larding people up.

11:09.485 --> 11:11.411
It just, uh,
it really resonated with me

11:11.487 --> 11:13.338
how you said there's no shame
in getting help.

11:13.489 --> 11:16.249
-There isn't.
-And how therapy
had worked wonders for you.

11:16.401 --> 11:17.967
-Oh, it did.
-Right.

11:18.828 --> 11:20.236
So why'd you stop going?

11:20.255 --> 11:21.404
Oh, I didn't stop going.

11:21.423 --> 11:23.181
-You didn't?
-No, I finished.

11:23.332 --> 11:25.408
-You finished?
-Yeah. Yeah.

11:25.427 --> 11:28.169
I completed
the department-mandated
anger management

11:28.188 --> 11:30.355
and got a certificate
to prove it

11:30.432 --> 11:32.615
and, uh, also got
my Tuesday nights back.

11:32.617 --> 11:35.694
so, as the kids say today,
I'm all Gucci.

11:37.513 --> 11:38.488
Are you?

11:40.016 --> 11:41.700
I just... I'm doing the math,

11:41.851 --> 11:44.185
and it seems like maybe
you stopped going to therapy

11:44.262 --> 11:46.946
before you punched
the last three guys.

11:47.098 --> 11:49.098
Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

11:49.100 --> 11:52.285
All three of those
were very unique circumstances.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.213
Nuance, Marwani.
Very important.

11:55.364 --> 11:56.456
MARJAN:
Of course. Um...

11:56.532 --> 11:59.217
(clears throat)
How about your meltdown

11:59.294 --> 12:01.386
with Catherine the other night?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.204
How nuanced was that?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.964
How do you know about that?

12:05.041 --> 12:06.966
You do know
who you live with, right?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.209
I didn't talk to Mateo.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.802
Well, did you tell Judd?

12:09.879 --> 12:11.521
Okay, now I'm pissed off.

12:13.124 --> 12:14.290
-Leave.
-Cap--

12:14.309 --> 12:15.583
You are overstepping
your bounds.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.143
-I'm try--
-This is above your pay grade,

12:17.295 --> 12:18.294
and it's none of your business.

12:18.296 --> 12:19.629
Cap, look, with all due respect,

12:19.647 --> 12:22.490
your emotional well-being
is all of our business.

12:23.151 --> 12:24.634
Okay, you know what?

12:24.652 --> 12:27.971
Tell your co-conspirators
that I have a resting heart rate

12:27.989 --> 12:29.247
of 54 beats per minute.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.824
I meditate every morning,
and I'm happy to report

12:31.977 --> 12:34.160
my chakras are all aligned.

12:34.237 --> 12:35.086
All of them!

12:35.163 --> 12:36.813
I'm full of equanimity,

12:36.815 --> 12:38.590
and I've got work to do.

12:40.001 --> 12:41.301
Okay.

12:42.045 --> 12:43.386
Yeah.

12:45.323 --> 12:47.724
-Okay.
-Unbelievable.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.090
(buzzer blaring)

12:56.109 --> 12:59.277
(crowd cheering)

13:02.007 --> 13:03.172
AL:
Come on, Bri.

13:03.174 --> 13:04.532
-Bri!
-Come on, Brian.

13:07.178 --> 13:08.953
Come on, Vaughn.

13:09.030 --> 13:11.030
Don't be a wuss.

13:11.107 --> 13:13.850
Stop wasting time
with this loser.

13:13.868 --> 13:14.867
You hear that guy?

13:14.944 --> 13:16.294
He's obviously an idiot, honey.

13:16.445 --> 13:18.779
Don't let him
get under your skin.

13:18.857 --> 13:20.873
He's talking about our son.

13:21.026 --> 13:23.209
FATHER:
Would you stop playing around?

13:23.286 --> 13:25.786
Hey, don't look at me.
Do not look at me.

13:25.864 --> 13:27.955
You keep your head in the match.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.390
Yeah!

13:30.977 --> 13:32.201
-Get out of it. Get out of it.
-Come on.

13:32.203 --> 13:33.978
Get out of it.

13:34.055 --> 13:36.255
Yeah, there you go, Brian,
there you go.

13:36.333 --> 13:38.224
-FATHER: Dominate that shrimp!
-Shrimp?

13:38.301 --> 13:40.893
-He just called Brian a shrimp.
-JOY: Al, take a breath.

13:41.046 --> 13:42.879
Stop wasting time
with this loser.

13:42.897 --> 13:44.897
There you go, baby.
Yeah, baby!

13:44.974 --> 13:45.882
Come on, Brian.

13:45.900 --> 13:46.991
Put his skinny ass on the mat.

13:47.068 --> 13:48.159
Come on, Brian.

13:48.236 --> 13:49.828
Now!

13:49.904 --> 13:51.812
Put him on the mat!
Get him down!

13:51.832 --> 13:53.206
Put his ass on the mat.

13:53.983 --> 13:55.482
That's a cheap shot!

13:55.502 --> 13:57.151
FATHER:
That's what I'm talkin' about.

13:57.228 --> 13:59.003
-(blows whistle)
-Just squeeze that bug!

13:59.155 --> 14:01.822
Illegal take-down.
One point red.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.591
FATHER: That's BS. Come on.

14:04.085 --> 14:05.635
That is BS.

14:07.755 --> 14:08.763
Relax.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.685
(Al grunts)

14:23.196 --> 14:25.421
OFFICER:
Thankfully, the minor
was unhurt in the assault.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.773
The suspect's situation, though,
is a little more complicated.

14:27.926 --> 14:29.367
Excuse us. Excuse us. Thank you.

14:29.518 --> 14:31.452
-JUDD: Comin' through.
-OWEN: Coming through.

14:31.946 --> 14:34.188
Whoa.

14:34.265 --> 14:36.599
I don't wanna say that I
recognize the view, but...

14:36.618 --> 14:37.600
Same butt.

14:37.785 --> 14:39.043
-MARJAN: Seriously?
-What are the odds?

14:39.195 --> 14:41.120
I'd say with this guy,
probably about 50-50.

14:41.272 --> 14:42.881
Alright, Marjan, Mateo,
you're with me.

14:43.032 --> 14:44.107
Everybody else,
just move the people back.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.366
And get some support
under his legs.

14:45.443 --> 14:47.293
Uh, TK, Nancy,
check on the other wrestlers.

14:47.370 --> 14:49.036
-Make sure they're okay.
-Yeah, Cap.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.947
Copy.

14:50.949 --> 14:52.448
-Hi, Al.
-Oh, God.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.133
Find yourself
in another pickle, huh?

14:54.210 --> 14:55.785
You in any pain?

14:55.803 --> 14:57.470
I'm too humiliated to feel pain.

14:57.546 --> 15:00.123
TOMMY: Oh.
Take a deep breath in for me.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.958
(inhales deeply)

15:01.960 --> 15:04.127
(exhales)

15:04.129 --> 15:06.312
Lungs sound good.
Vitals are strong.

15:06.464 --> 15:07.721
He's all yours.

15:07.815 --> 15:10.149
Maybe next time, take
a deep breath before you act.

15:10.226 --> 15:12.243
You sound like my wife... again.

15:12.470 --> 15:14.561
And you're not listening
to either one of us.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.989
How'd you get yourself
in this position anyway?

15:17.142 --> 15:19.250
Velocity.

15:19.327 --> 15:21.661
Kid pulled a cheap shot
on my boy.

15:21.737 --> 15:22.736
I saw red.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.405
Defending your family,
it's a noble thought,

15:24.424 --> 15:26.983
but it can lead to some
very serious consequences.

15:27.001 --> 15:28.742
Trust him, he knows.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.304
Mateo, get the saw.

15:31.914 --> 15:32.913
Wait, the saw?

15:33.007 --> 15:34.748
Unless you want the lard again.

15:34.826 --> 15:36.175
Oh, no, no, no.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.419
Hashtag Lardass
is still trending.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.088
Hey, take it from someone
who's been viral many times,

15:41.107 --> 15:42.848
the memes, they never last.

15:43.001 --> 15:47.261
Alright, listen,
I'm gonna give you
the number of my therapist.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.021
I really think
it could be useful for you.

15:49.023 --> 15:51.932
Dr. Patt can make
a big difference here.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.843
I'm putting it in your pocket.

15:53.845 --> 15:55.178
I'm sure he'll have an opening.

15:55.196 --> 15:56.746
He's not been all
that busy these days.

15:58.107 --> 16:02.251
(chainsaw revving)

16:08.468 --> 16:11.043
Alright, she's coming
around the horn.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.972
-Yeah. Give it a pull.
-JUDD: One, two, three.

16:14.048 --> 16:16.432
(onlookers laughing)

16:18.461 --> 16:20.720
My pants just split open,
didn't they?

16:20.872 --> 16:22.054
You barely can tell.

16:22.131 --> 16:24.315
Yeah. Come on,
let's, let's get him out.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.045
MATEO:
Come on. Get up, buddy.

16:29.063 --> 16:30.880
Ow. (grunts)

16:30.898 --> 16:32.715
-MATEO: You got it?
-AL: Yeah.

16:32.734 --> 16:33.741
(Al sighs)

16:37.388 --> 16:39.539
Let me check him out first.
Make sure he's okay.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.417
(sighs deeply)

16:43.837 --> 16:47.296
♪

16:57.833 --> 16:59.976
Dad, you okay?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.396
Uh, no, son.

17:04.006 --> 17:05.839
No, I'm not.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.316
(clears throat)
But I will be.

17:08.753 --> 17:11.738
A friend gave me the name
of a great therapist.

17:15.184 --> 17:16.592
EVIE:
How do you spell "prolific"?

17:16.611 --> 17:20.687
TOMMY:
Uh, prolific. P-R-O-L-I-F-I-C.

17:20.765 --> 17:22.022
Prolific.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.876
Okay, we're all done
with our thank you cards.

17:25.027 --> 17:26.461
Can we go play?

17:27.530 --> 17:28.963
Let's see what you got.

17:30.032 --> 17:31.716
Hmm. Nice.

17:31.867 --> 17:34.627
What's this?
Oh. Oh, wow!

17:34.779 --> 17:36.112
Okay. Y'all kinda went

17:36.130 --> 17:37.963
full Herman Melville
on this one.

17:38.116 --> 17:39.465
-It's for Uncle Julius.
-TOMMY: Oh, I see.

17:39.617 --> 17:40.616
"Dear Uncle Julius,

17:40.894 --> 17:42.709
"thanks for making
our birthday wishes come true.

17:42.787 --> 17:44.062
"Sorry our mom kicked you out.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.548
"We hope she changes her mind
so we can see you again soon

17:47.567 --> 17:50.293
"because we miss you a lot.
You're so cool.

17:50.311 --> 17:52.978
"We hope your time
with your band in Austin is fun

17:53.055 --> 17:56.223
"and your songwriting
is prolific.

17:56.317 --> 17:58.818
"Love, Izzy and Evie.

17:58.894 --> 18:01.079
PS. Sorry again about our mom."

18:01.230 --> 18:05.249
Okay, so was this meant
for Uncle Julius or for me?

18:05.401 --> 18:07.752
We can't help it
if you read all of our mail.

18:07.903 --> 18:08.828
Like a warden.

18:08.904 --> 18:10.496
Hey. Fresh.

18:10.573 --> 18:12.998
Why don't you like Uncle Julius?
He's so fun.

18:13.075 --> 18:15.000
And we never get to see him.

18:15.077 --> 18:17.320
Well, because Uncle Julius
never shows up.

18:17.322 --> 18:19.004
Except he's trying now.

18:19.081 --> 18:20.973
And you won't let him.

18:25.921 --> 18:27.772
-Hey, sis.
-Hey. Thanks for coming.

18:27.849 --> 18:30.424
Well, last time
you said that to me,
you were throwing me out.

18:30.518 --> 18:31.943
Well, now I'm inviting you in.

18:32.094 --> 18:33.111
Like a vampire.

18:33.187 --> 18:34.695
God, I hope not.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.178
-Where are the girls?
-They're at a friend's house.

18:42.196 --> 18:43.346
Listen, I know on the phone

18:43.364 --> 18:45.030
I told you that
they've been begging me

18:45.125 --> 18:47.441
to spend time with you, and...

18:47.518 --> 18:50.128
that's true.
But before that happens,

18:50.204 --> 18:52.713
you and I need to reach
some sort of detente.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.692
A cessation of hostilities.

18:56.711 --> 18:57.760
Something like that.

19:06.371 --> 19:07.870
I'm good.

19:07.889 --> 19:09.538
Um, actually, this is...

19:09.557 --> 19:14.193
more of a venting
of hostilities.

19:16.138 --> 19:17.062
Listen, I just
need to get this out,

19:17.215 --> 19:18.547
because if I don't
do this right now,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.900
then it's just gonna come out
later in front of the girls

19:21.052 --> 19:22.535
and I can't have that.

19:27.983 --> 19:29.375
On second thought...

19:36.234 --> 19:37.592
TOMMY: Mostly, I, uh...

19:39.161 --> 19:42.305
can't talk about Charles
without wanting to cry.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.560
But, um, right now...

19:48.930 --> 19:50.521
all I feel is anger.

19:52.049 --> 19:55.193
Your brother was many things.

19:56.921 --> 19:58.529
The one thing that he wasn't...

20:00.775 --> 20:02.283
he wasn't a fool.

20:04.762 --> 20:06.019
Except, Julius,

20:06.097 --> 20:07.997
when it came to you.

20:09.100 --> 20:12.268
You made him a fool.

20:12.286 --> 20:14.286
You were the only one
who could do that. He...

20:14.439 --> 20:18.382
He believed in you.
He-he made excuses for you.

20:18.459 --> 20:22.703
He loved you without cause,
without hesitation.

20:22.797 --> 20:24.222
And he was there for you

20:24.298 --> 20:28.951
every day of your charmed life.

20:28.953 --> 20:30.728
And when his came to an end...

20:31.714 --> 20:33.231
far too soon...

20:34.400 --> 20:37.735
you couldn't be bothered
to pay your respects.

20:45.060 --> 20:46.202
(sniffles)

20:47.655 --> 20:50.998
You know, and the thing is
that if he were here right now,

20:52.067 --> 20:53.668
I know exactly what he'd do.

20:54.829 --> 20:56.420
He'd forgive you.

20:57.257 --> 21:01.000
Even after that, he'd smile.

21:01.076 --> 21:02.985
He'd say, "Well, that's Julius.

21:03.004 --> 21:05.263
You gotta love Julius."

21:06.248 --> 21:08.224
You selfish jerk.

21:12.997 --> 21:14.272
(puts down glass)

21:14.941 --> 21:16.482
That's pretty much it.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.193
I was there.

21:21.005 --> 21:23.030
What? Where?

21:24.008 --> 21:26.284
I didn't skip the funeral.

21:27.102 --> 21:28.452
Not exactly.

21:31.015 --> 21:33.249
I drove up from Charlotte.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.127
I sat in front of the church.

21:36.278 --> 21:39.872
I watched you
and the girls go in.

21:39.948 --> 21:42.300
I-I-I couldn't
get out of the car.

21:46.121 --> 21:48.213
Yeah, I don't know
what to say to that.

21:48.366 --> 21:50.224
I think you already did.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.020
I failed you...

21:55.039 --> 21:58.040
and my nieces and him.

21:58.042 --> 22:00.484
And I am sorry.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.989
As pathetic as that is,
I just...

22:05.066 --> 22:07.658
I couldn't do it.
I just... I couldn't.

22:13.574 --> 22:16.225
All my strength
came from my big brother,

22:16.227 --> 22:19.295
and now he's gone.

22:23.084 --> 22:26.344
-I don't know what to do.
-Hey.

22:26.571 --> 22:30.255
(sniffles)
Oh, I-I know you hate me.

22:30.408 --> 22:34.167
But not more than
I hate myself right now.

22:34.245 --> 22:36.187
No, I... Um...

22:36.338 --> 22:38.004
I don't hate you.

22:38.082 --> 22:39.398

22:41.027 --> 22:43.486
I could never hate
Charles' brother.

22:46.348 --> 22:48.574
Not when he loved you so much.

22:49.594 --> 22:51.535

It's good to

So, um, this is your spot.
Tell me what's good.

24:39.553 --> 24:42.796
Well, their special
is the almond milk Gibraltar,

24:42.798 --> 24:44.148
so I would go with that.

24:44.299 --> 24:46.558
Mm. Gibraltar?
What's a Gibraltar?

OWEN: Uh, equal parts
almond milk and espresso.

24:49.547 --> 24:52.156
Comes in a terrific little cup.

24:52.307 --> 24:54.140
It's perfect with a scone,

24:54.160 --> 24:59.580
or, in my case,
a large slice of humble pie.

25:01.726 --> 25:03.058
Only a slice?

25:03.060 --> 25:05.294
Sure you don't want a whole pie?

25:07.155 --> 25:09.456
Yeah. Um...

25:09.533 --> 25:11.583
I just want you to know
how badly I feel

25:11.660 --> 25:15.328
about the whole
mistaken identity kerfuffle

25:15.406 --> 25:19.165
with your ex
and your ex-father-in-law.

25:19.243 --> 25:23.169

of having an old man fetish?

25:23.247 --> 25:25.247
Oh, yeah, that...

25:25.266 --> 25:28.234

I really still
like you too, Owen.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.884
I can't tell you
how happy it makes me

25:53.961 --> 25:55.427
to hear you say that.

25:55.963 --> 25:57.680
I'd like to...

25:59.058 --> 26:00.641
I'd like to give us
another shot.

26:02.119 --> 26:03.435
So would I.

26:04.955 --> 26:06.546
Really?

You just told me
that we were dating again.

26:22.990 --> 26:26.458
I said I-I want to date again.

26:27.402 --> 26:29.402
Well, what's stopping you?

26:29.422 --> 26:32.238
Before we do,
I think we should discuss

26:32.258 --> 26:36.335
a certain... foible you have.

26:36.487 --> 26:39.096
Foible?
What-what kind of foible?

26:39.323 --> 26:41.473
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

26:42.993 --> 26:44.343
Well, we've talked about, um...

26:44.495 --> 26:46.178
(clears throat)
...my vanity

26:46.330 --> 26:49.181
and my natural fear
of growing old.

26:49.333 --> 26:51.183
Do... Wait,
do-do I have another?

26:51.335 --> 26:53.927
-There-there is another one.
-What is it?

26:54.004 --> 26:55.187
You're really gonna
make me say it?

26:55.356 --> 26:57.856
Well, unless you wanna
emit it to me telepathically.

26:57.933 --> 26:59.524
It's your anger.

26:59.601 --> 27:02.678
-You have
an anger problem, Owen.
-Oh, come on.

27:02.696 --> 27:04.529
That is BS. It's BS.

27:04.624 --> 27:07.607

and it is super annoying.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.126
-Mm-hmm.
-What?

27:09.203 --> 27:10.352
In the short time
I have known you,

27:10.354 --> 27:12.204
you have lost your temper

27:12.298 --> 27:14.965
and sabotaged yourself
on multiple occasions.

27:15.117 --> 27:16.950
Yeah, well, I sabotaged us.

27:17.027 --> 27:20.028
Yes, but I own it.

27:20.030 --> 27:22.014
That's why we're here. I own it.

27:23.033 --> 27:24.457
Owen, you need help.

27:24.535 --> 27:27.052
Uh, and there's no shame
in admitting that.

27:27.204 --> 27:28.294
I know that.

27:28.372 --> 27:30.147
Okay, then why don't you
just do it?

Because I am telling you
that I don't need it.

27:32.652 --> 27:36.136

another foible to that list.

TK, prep the O2 and the EZ iO.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.487
-Yeah, Cap.
-I'll get sterile
gauze and water.

30:41.507 --> 30:42.914
Alright, and get
your trauma shears.

30:43.067 --> 30:44.716
-You're gonna need 'em.
-Copy.

30:46.904 --> 30:48.494
Hey.

30:48.572 --> 30:49.905
Hey!

30:49.907 --> 30:52.432
Hey, we need to help over here!

30:53.760 --> 30:55.018
OWEN: Al?

30:55.095 --> 30:56.411
You better not have been
a part of this.

30:56.430 --> 30:57.262

30:57.339 --> 30:58.930
We were on our way to therapy.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.083
And this maniac
started waving a gun

31:01.101 --> 31:02.175
and tried to
drive us off the road.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.101
We didn't do anything.

31:03.178 --> 31:04.603
Witnesses all back that up.

31:04.679 --> 31:06.530
Will you please
help my wife and boy.

31:06.607 --> 31:09.091
They need medical attention.
My wife, she cut her forehead

31:09.093 --> 31:10.442
and I think
Brian broke his wrist.

31:10.518 --> 31:12.260
Alright, Al,
I need you to listen to me.

31:12.279 --> 31:13.871

on the way, alright?

my crew's priority

Wait, wait.

who tried to kill my family?

I don't blame you but I
need to step back, okay?

third-degree burns,

how about his vitals?

39:01.565 --> 39:03.656
takes the mike,
cool as you like,

39:03.675 --> 39:07.235

"Lean on Me," a cappella.

on the stage and asks me

39:30.927 --> 39:32.243
to help him on the piano.

39:32.353 --> 39:36.856
