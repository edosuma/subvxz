00:07.051 --> 00:07.915
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.853 --> 00:09.979
Doug!

00:10.888 --> 00:13.880
The results don't have anything
to do with the accident.

00:14.191 --> 00:18.321
All this time I'm worrying
about HIV, and I get hepatitis C?

00:18.529 --> 00:21.589
Why not apply to a Locum Tenens
program, filling in...

00:21.799 --> 00:23.232
...for vacationing surgeons?

00:23.567 --> 00:26.092
- They pay you a bundle to step in.
- What's that?

00:26.303 --> 00:28.362
Eight, ten grand, for
a couple weeks.

00:28.806 --> 00:31.604
Can you say, "father"?
Can you say, "daddy"?

00:32.143 --> 00:33.132
Yeah!

00:37.148 --> 00:38.410
Hey, Peter!

00:38.716 --> 00:40.980
- Good morning.
- Hey, good morning.

00:41.185 --> 00:43.312
Wow! All this for just two weeks?

00:43.521 --> 00:45.989
It's been 30 below
in north Minnesota.

00:47.124 --> 00:50.890
- Will you be the only surgeon there?
- No, one of three.

00:51.295 --> 00:52.455
So you're all set.

00:52.663 --> 00:54.756
It's tough getting Reece squared away.

00:54.965 --> 00:57.263
Carla can't pick him up on Thursday...

00:57.468 --> 01:00.369
...and that's Jackie's rough day.
But other than that...

01:00.571 --> 01:01.799
Well, I can cover.

01:02.006 --> 01:04.634
No, no. Come on.
I couldn't ask you that.

01:04.842 --> 01:06.571
You didn't. I just offered.

01:06.844 --> 01:08.573
What are friends for?

01:10.848 --> 01:12.372
Okay. Yeah.

01:13.050 --> 01:15.712
Have Dr. Edson follow up
on these before discharge.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.822
A front's crossing the Rockies.
I hope you packed your long johns.

01:20.024 --> 01:22.117
- I'm wearing my long johns.
- Peter!

01:22.326 --> 01:26.558
Good thing I caught you. Locum Tenens
folks just called. Change of plans.

01:26.764 --> 01:28.789
You're needed elsewhere.
Better hustle.

01:28.999 --> 01:31.433
- Flight to Atlanta leaves in an hour.
- Atlanta?

01:31.635 --> 01:34.570
- From there to Biloxi.
- I didn't sign up for Biloxi.

01:34.772 --> 01:38.503
You pick up a car in Biloxi then
drive a few hours to LaVerne.

01:38.709 --> 01:40.540
LaVerne? Whoa, wait a minute!

01:40.744 --> 01:43.645
I signed a contract.
They can't just switch this now.

01:43.848 --> 01:45.839
That's what the fine print's about.

01:46.050 --> 01:49.611
It's a medical necessity. If you
back out, we'll look un-Hippocratic.

01:49.820 --> 01:53.347
You'll need the dough if you accept
the cardiothoracic fellowship.

01:55.693 --> 01:57.718
You're offering a cardiothoracic spot?

01:58.128 --> 02:01.154
Not officially until May.
But between you and me...

02:02.266 --> 02:04.962
Prestigious fellowships
always pay the least.

02:05.169 --> 02:08.229
Like it's an honor to let them
get you deeper in debt.

02:08.439 --> 02:09.770
Have a good trip.

02:09.973 --> 02:12.568
- Sorry, it's the rules.
- Let me up. I work here.

02:12.776 --> 02:15.108
- I could lose my job!
- I feel like an idiot.

02:15.312 --> 02:18.281
- You being discharged today?
- Yeah, one final indignity.

02:18.482 --> 02:21.474
Excuse me, miss.
I'll take over from here, okay?

02:21.685 --> 02:23.778
- Be my guest.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

02:24.188 --> 02:26.622
You're lucky you didn't
break any bones.

02:26.824 --> 02:31.056
- The windshield looks a lot worse.
- I'm sorry about the hep C.

02:31.262 --> 02:35.198
It doesn't scare me. Dr. Makadon
thinks I'll respond well to the meds.

02:35.399 --> 02:38.664
- Where you off to?
- Doing a stint at a rural hospital.

02:38.869 --> 02:42.134
At the last minute they stuck me
in the middle of nowhere.

02:42.339 --> 02:44.398
A place called LaVerne, Mississippi.

02:44.608 --> 02:46.838
- You're kidding! LaVerne?
- You know it?

02:47.044 --> 02:49.808
I have aunts and uncles
in that part of Mississippi.

02:50.014 --> 02:52.448
The Murdocks. I could
give you some numbers.

02:53.217 --> 02:54.775
I don't know about free time.

02:55.552 --> 02:59.113
I haven't been there since I was
a kid. I loved that place.

02:59.323 --> 03:03.020
I used to climb trees and get dirty.
They're all great cooks.

03:04.361 --> 03:06.261
Well, I'll keep an eye open.

03:06.463 --> 03:10.832
If you run into any of my relatives,
just don't mention my HIV status.

03:11.035 --> 03:13.469
- Of course not.
- I haven't told my family.

03:13.671 --> 03:17.266
- Just give them my love.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

05:33.977 --> 05:35.467
Hey, how you doing?

05:36.313 --> 05:37.940
Can't complain.

05:38.148 --> 05:40.343
- Is there a phone inside?
- Sorry.

05:41.085 --> 05:43.986
Car broke down. I need to call
the hospital in LaVerne.

05:44.188 --> 05:45.280
Son...

05:45.789 --> 05:47.279
...you in LaVerne.

05:49.927 --> 05:53.693
- Is there a hospital here?
- Who are you looking for?

05:53.931 --> 05:56.661
Okay, I'll tell you,
this looks real good.

05:56.867 --> 05:59.665
- Maureen!
- IKeep the patch on. Excuse me.

05:59.870 --> 06:03.237
- This gentleman looking for you.
- Miss Chapman, I'm Dr. Benton.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.637
Oh, I'd given up. They said
you'd be here yesterday.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.675
I didn't know until this morning.

06:09.179 --> 06:12.205
- You're here for a month?
- No, no, no. Two weeks.

06:13.383 --> 06:16.045
Hear that, leg? You got two weeks.

06:16.253 --> 06:19.689
I'm the nurse practitioner.
I'm supposed to stay off my feet...

06:19.890 --> 06:22.188
...but all these patients
keep getting sick.

06:22.392 --> 06:25.293
There's no hospital here?
I mean, just the clinic?

06:25.496 --> 06:28.488
Our nearest hospital is 80 miles,
in Green Cove.

06:29.133 --> 06:33.661
- Did you walk here?
- His car broke down on Jones Road.

06:33.904 --> 06:36.839
Oh. Well, my boy
is good with engines.

06:37.074 --> 06:39.201
Sonny! He'll take care of you.

06:39.409 --> 06:43.106
- Is the head doctor on duty now?
- Dr. Benton...

06:43.313 --> 06:47.682
...you are the doctor. And please
don't tell me that you're a dentist.

06:47.885 --> 06:52.015
- Okay, sweetie. IKeep that...
- I'm a fifth-year Surgical Resident.

06:52.222 --> 06:53.780
Oh, lord!

06:55.492 --> 06:59.553
- Sonny, Dr. Benton's car broke down.
- Yeah, I seen it.

07:00.397 --> 07:03.491
- Do you think you can fix it up?
- You're hurting.

07:03.834 --> 07:07.861
- Get to bed.
- Well, I need to help him get settled.

07:08.071 --> 07:09.663
No, no, no. You know what?

07:10.040 --> 07:12.167
There are only a few patients here.

07:12.943 --> 07:16.379
- What time do you close?
- When the last patient's gone.

07:18.248 --> 07:20.478
Have you ever practiced medicine?

07:20.951 --> 07:22.316
I can handle it.

07:22.586 --> 07:24.952
- Let's go.
- All right, suit yourself.

07:25.689 --> 07:29.557
Weather like this, folks sit out
here and you can see them inside.

07:30.327 --> 07:33.592
I expect you'll find everything
where it should be and...

07:33.797 --> 07:38.700
Everybody, this is Dr. Benton, from
Chicago. He'll take care of y'all.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.632
All right. Who's next?

07:47.945 --> 07:48.912
Bentons?

07:49.746 --> 07:51.976
I don't recollect any Bentons.

07:52.182 --> 07:54.082
My family's not from around here.

07:54.751 --> 07:57.219
So, what can I do for you today?

07:57.421 --> 08:01.881
Might have been some Bentons over
near Hattiesburg. I believe it's so.

08:02.392 --> 08:05.828
There was the schoolteacher,
Benton, over to Winona.

08:06.029 --> 08:07.155
She was a white lady.

08:07.464 --> 08:10.433
Died of consumption.
Coughed herself to the grave.

08:10.667 --> 08:13.067
Ms. Johnson, what is your complaint?

08:13.503 --> 08:16.631
Oh, I ain't got no complaint.

08:17.074 --> 08:21.101
No need to complain. Complaining
make it worse, what they say.

08:22.913 --> 08:25.780
- Do you have a medical problem?
- No.

08:26.183 --> 08:27.946
Just a burn.

08:28.185 --> 08:29.948
Okay. Where's the burn?

08:31.088 --> 08:34.352
I believe there are some Bentons
up off the riverfront.

08:36.460 --> 08:40.794
Maybe "Benders."
Maybe they was Benders.

08:43.267 --> 08:44.359
Benders.

08:45.202 --> 08:46.794
Mr. McCoy?

08:48.405 --> 08:49.929
Ruth Blalock?

08:52.209 --> 08:54.803
- They left?
- It appears so.

08:55.545 --> 08:58.639
- Jesse Morgan?
- That's me.

08:58.915 --> 09:00.906
I figured I'd let you
look at my leg.

09:01.118 --> 09:03.678
That's okay, Mr. Morgan.
You can stay seated.

09:06.523 --> 09:07.990
Sorry it took so long.

09:12.095 --> 09:15.360
- Pretty nasty looking ulcer.
- Yes, sir.

09:15.565 --> 09:19.433
I tried mustard seed on it. That
usually stops my leg from aching.

09:19.636 --> 09:22.104
No, you're gonna need
some antibiotics.

09:22.306 --> 09:26.106
Stay off this foot and soak it three
times a day in warm water, okay?

09:26.310 --> 09:27.675
Stay off it?

09:28.879 --> 09:29.868
And soak it?

09:30.147 --> 09:33.412
- Where do I put this, doctor?
- Excuse me?

09:33.617 --> 09:37.314
I'm sorry. Put it on the counter.
We'll send it out to the lab...

09:37.521 --> 09:40.149
...or however it's done.
Do you have a phone number?

09:41.024 --> 09:44.323
Oh, Maureen tells me on the spot.

09:44.528 --> 09:48.259
You take this in the backroom
and you do your test.

09:56.940 --> 09:59.306
- Mr. Morgan.
- Miss Pearl.

10:01.378 --> 10:04.176
How about the greens?
You can pick out the hamhocks.

10:04.381 --> 10:06.747
No, thank you.
I'll have another biscuit.

10:06.950 --> 10:08.850
After Dr. Rajiv...

10:09.252 --> 10:11.049
...he lasted about a month...

10:11.254 --> 10:12.619
...we sort of gave up.

10:12.823 --> 10:16.259
- It's hard to keep a doctor here.
- Well, I can see why.

10:16.793 --> 10:18.556
- No offense.
- None taken.

10:18.762 --> 10:22.061
We was fine until you tried
being more stubborn than the mare.

10:22.332 --> 10:24.357
- Fractured your leg?
- My knee ligaments...

10:24.568 --> 10:27.366
...and a herniated cervical disc.

10:29.773 --> 10:31.741
Guess it's lucky you don't mind lard.

10:35.912 --> 10:37.903
I'm sorry you missed your son.

10:38.615 --> 10:42.210
Well, had he gone to bed?
I heard you send your love.

10:42.652 --> 10:43.778
No.

10:44.521 --> 10:47.820
My son is deaf.
So the phone is of no use to us.

10:48.158 --> 10:51.821
I'd arranged for a video-phone
hookup at the hospital in Minnesota.

10:52.729 --> 10:56.688
- I guess you don't have one here, huh?
- Maybe, in Green Cove.

10:56.900 --> 11:00.529
Now, did Sonny get you
settled in the trailer?

11:01.304 --> 11:02.635
I don't work for him.

11:04.274 --> 11:07.732
Maybe you saw the motor home
behind the clinic.

11:08.178 --> 11:11.773
I'm afraid it's a little cozy
for a man your size but...

11:11.982 --> 11:14.883
- It'll be fine.
- And take care when you open the door.

11:16.119 --> 11:18.587
Or did you get it grounded, Sonny?

11:30.300 --> 11:31.426
Damn!

11:49.085 --> 11:50.643
Oh, shit!

11:57.727 --> 12:00.753
Take the temperature every
four hours. Call me if...

12:00.964 --> 12:05.298
Or see Dr. Benton at the clinic,
if it doesn't drop below 100...

12:05.502 --> 12:07.732
...by tomorrow.
- Thank you.

12:13.877 --> 12:16.505
- Busy day?
- No, not at all.

12:16.980 --> 12:21.007
- Since half my patients come here.
- It'll take time for...

12:21.218 --> 12:22.742
...some of them to accept you.

12:22.953 --> 12:25.683
No, it won't. I'm not staying.

12:26.323 --> 12:27.654
You don't need a surgeon.

12:28.158 --> 12:31.525
If you're gonna get any rest,
you need a doctor that everyone...

12:32.395 --> 12:33.384
...can accept.

12:33.730 --> 12:38.030
- This isn't just about race.
- I don't care what it's about.

12:38.435 --> 12:40.426
So you only came for the money?

12:41.538 --> 12:43.028
You can get by with a nurse.

12:43.240 --> 12:47.233
- Sonny hasn't even fixed your car yet.
- It's okay. I'll find a ride.

12:53.617 --> 12:55.812
So, thanks for the ride.

12:56.319 --> 12:58.947
Best reason we've had
to go to work all year.

12:59.823 --> 13:02.656
When we get to the dock,
you make sure every woman...

13:02.859 --> 13:04.918
...sees you getting out our truck!

13:05.128 --> 13:06.095
All right!

13:06.296 --> 13:09.561
Your Jake hears this, he won't
go out on no boat no time soon.

13:09.799 --> 13:12.233
Amen to that.
Now tell me something.

13:12.435 --> 13:14.869
- Now, is you really a doctor?
- Yeah.

13:15.438 --> 13:18.430
- Take a look at Annie hand then.
- Becca, I'm driving.

13:18.842 --> 13:20.707
Go on, show the man your hand.

13:24.681 --> 13:28.412
- Has you ever seen the likes of that?
- It's a pretty bad infection.

13:29.119 --> 13:31.587
The shrimps. They got
poisons in their head.

13:31.788 --> 13:35.588
If I were you, I'd take antibiotics
and rest, give it time to heal.

13:36.660 --> 13:37.490
Stop working?

13:38.695 --> 13:40.856
Unless you gonna stow me
up to Chicago.

13:43.066 --> 13:46.058
I don't think I could afford
to keep a woman like you.

13:51.207 --> 13:52.401
Hold on. What's that?

14:02.452 --> 14:03.612
Oh, hell!

14:05.322 --> 14:07.187
Help! Help me!

14:07.557 --> 14:08.888
Help me!

14:09.793 --> 14:12.318
- Help him.
- Sir, sir. Lie down, I'm a doctor.

14:12.529 --> 14:14.690
Branch caught in the throttle.
I couldn't...

14:14.898 --> 14:16.763
...get it out of gear.
- Don't move.

14:16.967 --> 14:19.458
Russell. My boy. Find my son.

14:19.669 --> 14:21.796
- Your son was with you?
- In my lap.

14:22.005 --> 14:24.200
- Okay. I'll find him.
- He's only 4!

14:24.407 --> 14:25.704
He couldn't have gone far.

14:36.553 --> 14:38.748
Ladies, over here!

14:42.759 --> 14:44.727
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

14:44.928 --> 14:48.591
- I need you to drive to a phone.
- Nearest town's five miles.

14:49.432 --> 14:51.923
- Sir! Do you have a phone?
- Yes!

14:52.135 --> 14:54.126
Next driveway. My wife's home.

14:54.337 --> 14:55.998
Go! Go! Call an ambulance!

14:56.206 --> 14:58.401
Tell them it's a matter
of life or death!

15:25.335 --> 15:27.064
Good morning, doctor.

15:28.271 --> 15:29.203
Hey.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.432
- Staying off that foot?
- Soaking it three times a day!

15:46.623 --> 15:49.649
- What?
- Anyone tell you smoking kills you?

15:49.859 --> 15:52.259
No! You the first.

15:52.862 --> 15:55.490
- Adelina, you been shopping?
- What it look like?

15:55.699 --> 15:58.167
- Got something for me?
- IKnow she do, Hubert.

15:58.368 --> 16:00.529
Yeah. A smack upside your head.

16:02.238 --> 16:03.933
Wait, you ain't showed us yet.

16:04.140 --> 16:08.133
- And I ain't going to.
- That girl crazy.

16:09.045 --> 16:11.843
I think it's looking
a lot better, Tavius.

16:12.048 --> 16:14.881
Come back in a couple days.
We'll take it off then.

16:15.085 --> 16:16.017
All right?

16:17.420 --> 16:19.684
Did you decide not to go?

16:20.390 --> 16:23.848
You can go and get some rest.
I'll take over.

16:25.295 --> 16:27.763
Somebody's waiting for you.
Sally?

16:29.165 --> 16:33.033
I'm Sally Mannon. We didn't get
a chance to meet last night.

16:33.236 --> 16:37.172
- Oh, yeah. I saw you.
- She told me about the accident.

16:37.774 --> 16:41.904
- So how's your husband and son?
- Fine, thanks to you.

16:43.179 --> 16:46.342
I brought you a pie. Sweet 'tater.
I hope you like that.

16:46.549 --> 16:48.176
Mrs. Mannon, are you kidding?

16:48.384 --> 16:50.579
It's my favorite.
I'll dig in right now.

16:50.787 --> 16:53.415
He gave my boy oxygen
all the way to Green Cove.

16:53.623 --> 16:55.716
You bagged him for 80 miles?

16:56.092 --> 16:57.719
In the back of a pickup.

17:01.798 --> 17:03.732
This is delicious. I'm sorry.

17:04.634 --> 17:06.761
It's the best thing I've had here.

17:08.771 --> 17:12.070
I gotta go. God bless you.

17:13.476 --> 17:15.340
Oh, thank you.

17:16.346 --> 17:18.246
You gonna stay, then?

17:18.681 --> 17:20.342
It's not that busy.

17:20.884 --> 17:23.682
That's because I make rounds
on Tuesdays.

17:23.887 --> 17:26.481
- Rounds?
- House calls.

17:26.689 --> 17:29.055
I heard one of the
Ebee girls is pregnant.

17:29.626 --> 17:33.062
They live far out. I'm sure
she hasn't had any prenatal care.

17:33.263 --> 17:35.925
I haven't done OB since med school.

17:36.132 --> 17:38.930
- Well, never mind. I'll go.
- No, no, no. Look.

17:39.636 --> 17:42.366
I'm not saying no.
I'll go if I can use your truck.

17:42.572 --> 17:44.403
Sonny hasn't fixed my car yet.

17:44.941 --> 17:47.171
You can't get there by car.

18:07.797 --> 18:09.287
What y'all want?

18:09.899 --> 18:11.264
I'm Dr. Benton.

18:11.501 --> 18:13.230
Miss Chapman sent me
to check on your daughter.

18:13.436 --> 18:15.461
She don't need checking.

18:17.507 --> 18:18.667
That it?

18:20.743 --> 18:24.770
All right. Hurry up before your pa
gets back. You know how he is.

18:24.981 --> 18:26.505
- Go on. Hurry.
- Sir?

18:26.716 --> 18:29.150
Doctor? Sir? If you don't mind...

18:29.352 --> 18:31.286
...I was feeling faint yesterday.

18:31.554 --> 18:32.953
Want me to examine you?

18:33.890 --> 18:36.654
Ma says you can check me out here.

18:37.093 --> 18:39.618
Believe me. You don't want to go in.

18:42.832 --> 18:46.359
I'm concerned about your blood
pressure. It's a little high.

18:47.136 --> 18:49.696
Have you had other problems
besides dizziness?

18:50.940 --> 18:54.376
A little bit of blood
came out last week.

18:55.678 --> 18:58.579
Well, I'm no specialist.
But I think you should...

18:58.781 --> 19:01.443
...get an ultrasound and
blood tests in Green Cove.

19:01.651 --> 19:02.515
What's going on?

19:03.953 --> 19:06.979
Papa, Dr. Benton is looking after me.

19:07.557 --> 19:10.082
This would be the doctor
for you, wouldn't it?

19:11.327 --> 19:15.161
- Sir, your daughter needs some tests.
- She don't need nothing from you.

19:15.598 --> 19:18.692
- Her blood pressure is elevated.
- Melanie Irene, get in.

19:24.674 --> 19:26.539
Get this man off my property.

19:27.043 --> 19:29.978
Melanie's had enough help
from his kind already.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.472
See what the authorities say.

19:32.682 --> 19:35.446
You can call the president
as far as I'm concerned.

19:35.652 --> 19:38.621
Ain't nobody gonna tell me
how to do for my kid.

19:48.131 --> 19:49.325
Reece.

19:49.565 --> 19:52.329
<i>The "A" hand knuckles rub</i>
<i>against one another...</i>

19:52.535 --> 19:53.661
<i>...in circles.</i>
- Wash.

19:53.870 --> 19:55.531
<i>The prone right hand is drawn...</i>

19:55.738 --> 19:57.831
Wash your hands, Reece.

19:58.041 --> 20:00.805
Reece, wash your hands.

20:03.379 --> 20:04.209
Mr. Morgan?

20:05.715 --> 20:07.342
Oh, morning, doctor.

20:08.051 --> 20:12.681
- I told you to stay off that foot.
- And wash it three times a day.

20:12.922 --> 20:14.514
Why are you walking on it?

20:15.758 --> 20:18.852
I can't wash my foot
without water, now, can I?

20:19.062 --> 20:20.859
Have a good day, doctor.

20:28.338 --> 20:31.865
Your glucose level is too high.
What do you want it to be?

20:32.075 --> 20:33.975
Adelina, answer the doctor.

20:34.844 --> 20:37.574
Between 70 and 120, sir.

20:38.848 --> 20:40.941
Nurse Maureen diagnosed
you a month ago.

20:41.150 --> 20:43.812
You should have better control
over your diabetes.

20:44.354 --> 20:46.982
You checking your glucose
level three times a day?

20:48.558 --> 20:50.651
You check it after you
drank that soda?

20:50.860 --> 20:53.761
- Adelina!
- I only took a sip.

20:54.364 --> 20:55.854
That's one sip too many.

20:56.566 --> 20:58.557
If her glucose isn't under control...

20:58.768 --> 21:01.669
...she'll damage her kidneys,
heart, even go blind.

21:01.871 --> 21:03.600
She could have another seizure.

21:03.806 --> 21:06.070
It was my fault for
not bringing her in.

21:06.275 --> 21:09.301
I don't think highly of doctors
since we lost her mama.

21:10.713 --> 21:11.680
Okay.

21:11.881 --> 21:14.941
All right, you gonna show me
how to inject this?

21:15.518 --> 21:16.610
No, sir.

21:17.854 --> 21:20.516
All right. Well, I'll show you.

21:29.065 --> 21:30.532
Been shopping?

21:30.733 --> 21:34.032
Yeah. Thought I'd cook some
vegetables, if you don't mind.

21:34.237 --> 21:35.135
Be fine.

21:35.972 --> 21:37.530
How'd the clinic go?

21:38.808 --> 21:41.538
Adelina Young came in with
a glucose level of 280.

21:42.678 --> 21:46.205
Grandmother claims they haven't
gotten insulin or glucose strips.

21:46.616 --> 21:49.346
- Oh, Lord!
- She doesn't understand the routine.

21:50.186 --> 21:52.848
Adelina should've received
diabetic teaching.

21:53.222 --> 21:56.123
- That's not gonna happen.
- Try a sub-Q insulin pump.

21:56.325 --> 21:58.987
- Heard of those?
- Something newer than leeches?

22:01.364 --> 22:02.296
Look...

22:03.699 --> 22:06.293
...I'm just trying to raise
the standard of care.

22:06.502 --> 22:09.528
- We should expect 100o/o.
- I do.

22:09.739 --> 22:13.266
- But I've learned to settle for 60o/o.
- 60o/o is failure.

22:13.476 --> 22:15.535
- It takes time for...
- They've had a month!

22:15.745 --> 22:18.612
Adelina is an athlete.
She's probably scared that...

22:18.815 --> 22:21.409
...this will end that.
- She could go into a coma!

22:21.617 --> 22:24.051
- Don't you think I know that?
- I don't know.

22:25.788 --> 22:28.518
Maureen! Maureen, you gotta come!

22:28.858 --> 22:30.883
Something's wrong with Melanie!

22:31.160 --> 22:33.651
She's been laboring
and the baby won't come!

22:33.930 --> 22:36.592
- Dr. Benton?
- No, I want you, Maureen.

22:36.799 --> 22:39.563
You're a damn fool, Eli.
I can't move that fast.

22:39.769 --> 22:41.430
Just think of Melanie.

22:41.637 --> 22:42.604
Well, come on.

22:54.183 --> 22:56.310
- Oh, sweet Jesus!
- I need more light!

22:56.519 --> 22:59.579
The generator's busted!
Get on outside! Go on!

22:59.989 --> 23:02.514
Oh, Mama, help me!

23:02.725 --> 23:05.057
Melanie, I need you to relax. Okay?

23:05.294 --> 23:06.727
I know. I know. Come on.

23:06.929 --> 23:08.863
I don't think the head is engaged.

23:10.333 --> 23:11.857
Damn it! I feel the foot!

23:12.068 --> 23:14.798
- What does that mean?
- The baby's upside-down.

23:15.004 --> 23:18.167
- What are you doing?
- Looking up how to deliver this baby.

23:18.374 --> 23:20.706
- You don't know?
- I'm a surgeon, not an OB.

23:20.910 --> 23:22.571
- Any flashlights?
- A couple.

23:22.778 --> 23:26.805
Get them! And blow out these candles!
I'm gonna use ether if I find it.

23:27.383 --> 23:29.851
Okay, I need you to
breathe nice and easy.

23:30.052 --> 23:32.043
- I can't!
- You're gonna have to try.

23:32.255 --> 23:34.883
- What are you doing to her?
- She has to be sedated.

23:35.091 --> 23:38.549
- A uterus rupture could kill her.
- I might, once I see the bastard.

23:38.761 --> 23:40.319
- You hush!
- Mrs. Ebee...

23:40.530 --> 23:43.090
...hold this over her face,
letting it drip onto...

23:43.299 --> 23:44.926
...the mask like this.
- All right.

23:45.134 --> 23:48.001
- She brought this on herself.
- Mr. Ebee, can you read?

23:48.204 --> 23:49.728
- Of course I can.
- Go!

23:49.939 --> 23:52.533
I need you to read off
this computer screen now.

23:57.246 --> 23:58.873
You do it, Mama.

24:06.022 --> 24:09.480
"Insert... the right hand...

24:09.692 --> 24:12.593
...into the ker... ker..."
- Cervix. Cervix.

24:12.795 --> 24:14.422
Okay, that's it, come on, go on.

24:15.131 --> 24:17.861
"Push the head...

24:18.067 --> 24:21.628
...and with the left hand external...

24:22.038 --> 24:25.030
...bring the rump down."

24:25.241 --> 24:27.004
- "Rump."
- Stop.

24:30.379 --> 24:34.315
- Okay, go on.
- "Lift the feet up...

24:34.984 --> 24:36.884
...and push the head...

24:37.086 --> 24:38.815
...over the...

24:39.021 --> 24:40.181
...pelvis rim."

24:41.757 --> 24:44.282
Oh, damn it! All right.

24:46.062 --> 24:46.926
Come on.

24:52.168 --> 24:53.328
All right.

24:54.570 --> 24:55.867
I got one foot out.

25:00.109 --> 25:00.939
All right...

25:03.579 --> 25:05.012
...there's the other one.

25:09.185 --> 25:12.677
- Damn it! Head's stuck.
- Oh, please, Jesus!

25:13.556 --> 25:15.183
Okay, okay, come on.
Come on.

25:15.625 --> 25:17.684
All right, we're almost there.

25:19.695 --> 25:21.390
Okay, stop the drip.

25:30.072 --> 25:30.902
Hey.

25:33.609 --> 25:36.134
Okay, you got a granddaughter.

25:42.151 --> 25:45.086
She looks just like an Ebee.
See, Eli?

25:45.288 --> 25:46.220
I see.

25:51.494 --> 25:53.121
Melanie's damn lucky.

26:03.139 --> 26:04.663
How are you feeling?

26:05.274 --> 26:06.605
Happy.

26:08.778 --> 26:12.612
- Is my baby okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

26:14.784 --> 26:17.776
You know, from what your
father said, I have to ask:

26:18.454 --> 26:21.116
Is there any chance the
baby's father is black?

26:21.324 --> 26:24.487
- You see her baby. She's white.
- I know.

26:25.861 --> 26:28.591
So you know, a lot of
African-American babies...

26:28.798 --> 26:31.824
...don't get full pigmentation
until a few days later.

26:32.034 --> 26:35.197
So if there's any chance of that,
for both your safety...

26:36.739 --> 26:39.071
...you need to let me know.
Okay?

26:46.082 --> 26:47.515
I got worried.

26:48.951 --> 26:50.578
It was a breech.

26:51.354 --> 26:52.981
Mother and baby are fine.
But...

26:53.756 --> 26:55.656
...I have to take them to LaVerne.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.615
Not in my boat.

26:59.261 --> 27:02.594
Hey, doc. Don't take off just yet.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.395
Here.

27:07.069 --> 27:08.661
There's no charge.

27:11.040 --> 27:11.870
Maureen?

27:13.008 --> 27:14.475
Much obliged, Eli.

27:19.415 --> 27:22.782
- That took a lot for him to offer.
- I don't want his money.

27:22.985 --> 27:26.216
The baby's jaundiced.
I hope they can stay at your house.

27:26.422 --> 27:28.652
- Jaundice usually goes away.
- No.

27:29.759 --> 27:32.922
Tell them that the mother
and baby have to be taken in.

27:56.118 --> 27:57.142
How you doing?

27:58.354 --> 28:00.254
I don't want to talk about it.

28:02.124 --> 28:03.250
Good.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.055
I didn't come here to talk.

28:08.731 --> 28:09.629
Come on.

29:00.282 --> 29:03.718
- Morning, doctor.
- How are you doing, Mr. Morgan?

29:03.919 --> 29:06.911
Did you drop that big jug
of water off on my porch?

29:07.122 --> 29:10.182
- Yeah.
- I sure want to thank you.

29:10.392 --> 29:12.553
But I had to come to town anyway.

29:12.761 --> 29:15.855
If I don't sit in this chair,
who's gonna do it?

29:23.806 --> 29:24.773
Hey.

29:24.974 --> 29:27.101
- Hi.
- You're on your feet again.

29:27.309 --> 29:30.073
I only got your help
for a few more days.

29:30.279 --> 29:35.114
Thought we could hold down the fort
here, and send you to the pharmacy.

29:35.317 --> 29:36.284
How's the baby?

29:36.852 --> 29:40.117
Her jaundice doesn't
appear any worse.

29:40.322 --> 29:42.722
- Melanie's itching to go home.
- Sonny...

29:42.925 --> 29:44.916
...go get Dr. Benton his keys.

29:46.428 --> 29:47.918
It's only been three days.

29:49.465 --> 29:52.798
If the baby's pigment were gonna
darken, it would've started.

29:57.172 --> 29:58.139
Probably.

29:59.341 --> 30:01.434
It was smart, the way
you handled Ebee.

30:02.444 --> 30:06.437
You know, you may have a flair
for country medicine after all.

30:09.518 --> 30:12.919
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I don't either.

30:13.822 --> 30:17.815
- I don't feel like driving 80 miles.
- Adelina and her grandma...

30:18.027 --> 30:19.995
...are willing to keep you company.

30:20.429 --> 30:24.263
- She says she doesn't trust hospitals.
- Well, she must be sweet on you.

30:25.267 --> 30:26.894
And I heard...

30:27.102 --> 30:29.127
...they have the video phone
hooked up.

30:29.338 --> 30:30.930
Might could see your son.

30:46.422 --> 30:48.515
Dr. Benton said the pump is better.

30:48.724 --> 30:50.715
I'll consider giving you one if you...

30:50.926 --> 30:52.791
...learn to control your glucose...

30:52.995 --> 30:55.020
...by the time we get them.
How's that?

30:56.031 --> 30:59.467
I'm a little more concerned
about another finding, though.

30:59.668 --> 31:02.899
Dr. Benton, did you detect a
pansystolic murmur in Adelina?

31:04.173 --> 31:06.164
- A murmur?
- Yes, sir.

31:06.442 --> 31:10.435
I thought I appreciated a slight
murmur along the left sternal border.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.140
- The echo shows a VSD.
- What's that?

31:15.117 --> 31:17.142
No. I didn't listen to her chest.

31:17.820 --> 31:20.311
- She was in for her diabetes.
- What's wrong?

31:21.156 --> 31:25.252
- Adelina's heart has a small hole.
- A hole?

31:25.461 --> 31:27.759
- From the diabetes?
- No, it's unrelated.

31:27.963 --> 31:30.693
- She's probably had it since birth.
- Uh-huh.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.868
It should be repaired
before it gets worse.

31:34.737 --> 31:35.567
Excuse me.

31:38.474 --> 31:41.705
- What does he mean by repaired?
- It's a simple surgery.

31:41.910 --> 31:44.777
- I'm having surgery?
- I don't want her cut.

31:44.980 --> 31:46.971
You never said I needed surgery.

31:49.785 --> 31:53.653
- I missed it.
- Dr. Benton, call is ready.

31:55.491 --> 31:56.788
Excuse me, please.

32:00.062 --> 32:02.053
Reece, what are you laughing at?

32:02.264 --> 32:03.754
Reece, come on.

32:03.966 --> 32:05.490
Come on, wash your hands.

32:05.834 --> 32:08.200
<i>- E</i> x <i>cuse me, Dr. Corday?</i>
- Okay.

32:08.404 --> 32:11.339
<i>They're actually saying</i>
<i>that we've got to go now.</i>

32:11.540 --> 32:15.169
- Thanks, Elizabeth. Four more days.
<i>- Right.</i>

32:15.377 --> 32:18.540
- I'll be home on Friday.
<i>- He'll be thrilled to see you.</i>

32:19.048 --> 32:21.539
Okay, Reece. I gotta go. Bye-bye.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.480
Bye-bye! Come on, Reece, say bye-bye.

32:28.824 --> 32:30.348
You going home this Friday?

32:31.860 --> 32:34.693
Yeah. But Dr. Brookes will
find you a good surgeon.

32:35.431 --> 32:38.161
And what else is he gonna
find wrong with her?

32:39.735 --> 32:43.762
Mrs. Deane, I know it's hard to plan
ahead, but if we could set the date...

32:43.972 --> 32:45.496
I'll think it over.

32:45.708 --> 32:48.176
- Yes, ma'am.
- You shouldn't put this thing off.

32:48.377 --> 32:50.607
- What about next week?
- I'll think about it.

32:50.813 --> 32:53.976
- But you will call Dr. Brookes, right?
- As soon as I can.

32:58.987 --> 33:01.581
- That took a while.
- Ignorance, just ignorance.

33:01.790 --> 33:04.759
There's no reason why a kid
in this century couldn't...

33:05.060 --> 33:06.027
What happened?

33:07.096 --> 33:08.927
- They found Jesse dead.
- Oh, man.

33:09.131 --> 33:11.497
In front of Sugg's Store
after you left.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.725
Was it MI? Why didn't you page me?

33:14.069 --> 33:18.005
- It could've been his heart, a stroke.
- Or an embolism.

33:18.941 --> 33:20.704
He said his leg ached and l...

33:22.177 --> 33:25.169
- I should have checked him out.
- He was an old man.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.348
There was nothing we could do.

33:28.350 --> 33:32.081
God rest his soul. Funeral's Friday.

33:32.521 --> 33:37.356
I've been saying Jesse wanted to
lay with his wife in our churchyard.

33:37.559 --> 33:39.550
But he born a Catholic.

33:39.762 --> 33:43.254
And I know he'd want
the sister to offer a prayer.

33:43.465 --> 33:44.727
What sister?

33:46.168 --> 33:49.194
May the angels lead you into paradise.

33:49.772 --> 33:53.731
And may the martyrs come to welcome
you and take you to the Holy City...

33:54.209 --> 33:57.269
...the new and eternal Jerusalem.

33:57.980 --> 34:00.471
And may the choir of angels
welcome you.

34:01.116 --> 34:06.110
Where Lazarus is poor no longer,
may you have eternal rest.

34:07.856 --> 34:11.849
Eternal rest, grant unto him,
O Lord.

34:13.362 --> 34:16.058
And let perpetual life
shine upon him.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.232
And may he rest in peace.

34:23.438 --> 34:24.905
Goodbye, Jesse.

34:28.177 --> 34:30.645
- Amen.
- Amen.

34:36.385 --> 34:39.377
- You's a liar. You do not.
- I do too.

34:39.588 --> 34:43.080
You just stick it and push
the insulin.

34:43.292 --> 34:45.954
Adelina thinks she's gonna
be a doctor one day.

34:46.161 --> 34:48.561
- Hubert!
- That's what you said.

34:48.764 --> 34:51.460
What's wrong with that?
She'd make a fine doctor.

34:51.766 --> 34:53.598
I changed my mind.

34:53.902 --> 34:55.426
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

34:55.637 --> 34:58.936
Because doctors act like they
know everything when they don't.

34:59.775 --> 35:01.003
Yep.

35:01.877 --> 35:03.640
We make mistakes.

35:04.346 --> 35:06.678
I made a mistake with your diagnosis.

35:07.216 --> 35:08.581
But I learned something...

35:09.651 --> 35:11.016
...just because of you.

35:13.121 --> 35:14.452
I am sorry, Adelina.

35:16.458 --> 35:17.857
It's okay.

35:23.599 --> 35:24.725
Oh, that was for me?

35:26.568 --> 35:30.265
If you're thinking of arguing with
Grandma Deane, I'd save my breath.

35:30.472 --> 35:32.906
Adelina needs surgery.
I just can't leave.

35:33.108 --> 35:34.939
Well, I'll work on her.

35:35.143 --> 35:36.735
She'll come around.

35:38.046 --> 35:39.638
Finished packing?

35:40.749 --> 35:43.217
I appreciate you sticking it out here.

35:43.819 --> 35:46.879
- I didn't do anything.
- What?

35:47.089 --> 35:50.957
Well, maybe not by
Chicago-surgeon standards.

35:51.159 --> 35:53.593
But you took good care of LaVerne.

35:55.163 --> 35:56.960
I love this town.

35:57.933 --> 36:00.458
I guess that's hard
for you to understand.

36:00.903 --> 36:04.339
Yeah. Well, I'm not the
missionary type, you know?

36:05.307 --> 36:08.333
Well, I never did well with
a doctor over my shoulder.

36:08.911 --> 36:12.506
This is a good place for a nun
with authority issues.

36:15.384 --> 36:18.615
What's your specialty gonna be?
Bet you've thought it out.

36:18.820 --> 36:21.846
Five years ago I decided
to go into cardiothoracic.

36:22.491 --> 36:25.722
Well, no wonder it stung you
to miss that heart murmur.

36:26.194 --> 36:28.822
- I missed it too.
- Yeah, but you're a nurse.

36:29.031 --> 36:30.623
Look out, now.

36:31.867 --> 36:34.392
I don't know. This last year
I've been...

36:35.337 --> 36:37.828
...I've been distracted,
with my son and all.

36:38.206 --> 36:42.040
- Well, it's not easy raising a child.
- Well, you would know that.

36:42.978 --> 36:46.277
I've just had Sonny
the last few years.

36:46.715 --> 36:49.047
I took him in when his folks died.

36:51.386 --> 36:53.183
Being a parent's a full-time job.

36:53.755 --> 36:56.189
Yeah. It's hard work but...

36:57.392 --> 36:59.053
...I love being with my son.

37:00.696 --> 37:01.720
Oh, man.

37:01.964 --> 37:05.764
Well, being with people.
It's as simple as that, isn't it?

37:07.736 --> 37:09.897
And what a blessing when you...

37:10.839 --> 37:12.864
...can hear the sound
of your own heart.

37:14.376 --> 37:18.244
- Shrimp boat blew down in South Port!
- How many hurt?

37:28.423 --> 37:30.687
- I'm a doctor! How bad?
- Sank the boat.

37:30.892 --> 37:33.622
Guy blew through the roof.
Boat's bringing him in.

37:33.829 --> 37:35.524
- Pulled a guy out.
- Why's it there?

37:35.764 --> 37:37.095
Raising the outriggers.

37:37.299 --> 37:38.561
- How long?
- 15 minutes.

37:38.767 --> 37:42.328
- Too long. Can you get me out there?
- IKenny's boat's right here.

37:42.537 --> 37:44.095
Doc needs to get to the boat!

37:44.306 --> 37:46.035
Round up a first-aid kit...

37:46.241 --> 37:47.265
...and fresh water!

37:47.476 --> 37:49.444
- You got it!
- Go! Go!

37:57.886 --> 37:59.649
Here we go. Nice and easy!

37:59.855 --> 38:02.119
Maureen, we got two bad injuries:

38:02.324 --> 38:06.260
A flailed chest with evisceration
and a partial amputation of the thigh.

38:06.495 --> 38:08.690
Bottled water and two first-aid kits.

38:08.930 --> 38:10.261
Lay them down over here.

38:11.266 --> 38:15.134
Didn't secure their propane tank.
Rolled into the engine room...

38:15.337 --> 38:17.305
...hit the boiler. Whole boat blew.

38:19.041 --> 38:22.204
If we stabilize the chest wall,
he'll breathe. Don't die on me.

38:22.411 --> 38:25.471
I need a small fishing fly
and some leader.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.671
Anyone have fishhook pliers?

38:27.883 --> 38:30.317
- I got a needle-nose in my box.
- All right, go!

38:30.519 --> 38:31.781
- Sonny!
- Yeah!

38:31.987 --> 38:35.616
He's gonna die without your help.
I need some Saran Wrap.

38:35.857 --> 38:36.949
- Saran Wrap?
- Right!

38:37.159 --> 38:38.888
- What is that?
- Shrimp factory!

38:39.094 --> 38:40.721
- Try them! Go!
- Where's the ice?

38:40.929 --> 38:42.863
I got flies and leader here.

38:43.065 --> 38:45.397
Peel the fur and feathers off
the small one.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.534
Thread it and rub alcohol over it.

38:47.736 --> 38:50.466
I need alcohol from the kit!
Maureen, how you doing?

38:50.672 --> 38:54.108
Leg's ischemic. We don't get
the tourniquet off, he's losing it.

38:54.309 --> 38:57.073
- Ice ain't that clean.
- Just pack it around his leg.

39:00.082 --> 39:02.778
- How's yours holding up?
- I've got a faint pulse.

39:02.984 --> 39:04.349
Where the hell is Sonny?

39:05.587 --> 39:08.317
Here you go, Dr. Benton.
I had to steal it.

39:08.523 --> 39:11.253
Listen carefully, I'm depending
on you. Over here.

39:11.460 --> 39:15.487
I'm gonna stabilize his chest with
the Saran Wrap. Wrap it around him.

39:15.697 --> 39:17.221
Here we go. Roll him.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.998
Lift him up. Here we go. Let's go!

39:22.037 --> 39:26.064
- Any gauze or bandages over there?
- I've used it up on this fellow.

39:26.274 --> 39:28.970
- I need something to hold in his guts!
- My T-shirt?

39:29.177 --> 39:30.371
Fine, take it off.
Here!

39:31.813 --> 39:34.509
Here we go. You stay here.
Give me your hand.

39:34.716 --> 39:37.617
There. As long as you
feel a pulse, he's alive.

39:37.819 --> 39:40.287
- Lf it stops, let me know.
- Needle's threaded.

39:40.489 --> 39:41.854
All right, you ready?

39:43.992 --> 39:46.187
I'll tie the superficial
femoral artery...

39:46.394 --> 39:47.827
...to stop the bleeding.

39:48.230 --> 39:50.460
Release the tourniquet slowly...

39:50.665 --> 39:53.862
...so I can isolate the artery
and clean out any clots.

39:54.736 --> 39:58.467
Okay. Now, tighten the tourniquet.
Here we go.

40:00.008 --> 40:03.637
- How are we doing there, Sonny?
- Breathing. Still has a pulse.

40:04.045 --> 40:05.171
Good.

40:06.448 --> 40:07.938
Good. Come on, cut!

40:19.561 --> 40:22.121
- Nice work, Dr. Benton.
- Yeah.

40:22.731 --> 40:23.823
You too.

40:31.039 --> 40:33.371
Guess I ought to try
to borrow a shirt.

40:34.109 --> 40:35.098
Sonny.

40:36.077 --> 40:37.567
You did good today, man.

40:45.053 --> 40:48.045
We were mighty lucky
there was a surgeon in town.

40:49.291 --> 40:51.555
And I'm sorry you missed your flight.

40:52.460 --> 40:54.291
Well, I'll catch one tomorrow.

41:12.380 --> 41:13.779
You leaving so early?

41:14.316 --> 41:16.341
Yeah. I gotta take care of something.

42:43.004 --> 42:44.733
Hey, you're back.

42:45.707 --> 42:47.368
So, how was it?

42:47.742 --> 42:48.902
Different.

42:49.110 --> 42:50.475
Congratulations.

42:50.679 --> 42:52.943
Robert Romano told me
you're a shoo-in...

42:53.148 --> 42:55.309
...for a cardiothoracic
spot next year.

42:55.517 --> 42:58.680
Cardiothoracic is a pretty
time-consuming specialty.

42:58.887 --> 43:00.286
I have a son, you know?

43:01.323 --> 43:03.120
What are you doing here anyway?

43:04.459 --> 43:05.619
I'm visiting Jeanie.

43:14.903 --> 43:16.029
Hey, Jeanie.

43:16.404 --> 43:17.928
Peter, hey.

43:18.873 --> 43:22.001
- How was the middle of nowhere?
- It wasn't bad.

43:22.477 --> 43:25.913
- I didn't run into your family.
- Oh, well.

43:30.151 --> 43:31.448
So...

43:33.855 --> 43:36.380
- You had a setback, huh?
- Yeah.

43:36.591 --> 43:38.752
The plasma will help. Damn it!

43:41.563 --> 43:44.999
Peter, don't touch me.
For God's sake, I'm poison.

43:56.644 --> 43:57.975
I can't do this.

44:00.749 --> 44:02.011
I can't.

44:03.818 --> 44:05.718
You can't do this alone.

44:16.731 --> 44:17.857
Yeah?
