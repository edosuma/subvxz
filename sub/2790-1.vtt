00:56.204 --> 00:59.257
<i>There are lots of problems that
plague our regular culture.</i>

00:59.258 --> 01:02.794
<i>Hate, people discriminate
against each other.</i>

01:02.795 --> 01:05.330
<i>There's this world
where you can come</i>

01:05.331 --> 01:07.837
<i>and it's free of a lot
of those problems.</i>

01:11.830 --> 01:13.304
<i>If you want to feel welcome,</i>

01:13.305 --> 01:16.207
<i>you want to feel loved and
accepted for who you are,</i>

01:16.208 --> 01:18.143
<i>this is the place to be.</i>

01:18.144 --> 01:20.905
<i>No one cares about where you go to
school, or how much money you make,</i>

01:20.906 --> 01:22.280
<i>or what the color
of your skin is.</i>

01:22.281 --> 01:24.582
<i>All of that is just
put to the side.</i>

01:24.583 --> 01:26.918
<i>You don't see any walls.
You see everyone together.</i>

01:26.919 --> 01:29.422
<i>I'm beginning to be
who I actually am.</i>

01:30.422 --> 01:33.424
<i>Experiencing EDC
really changed my life.</i>

01:33.425 --> 01:35.145
<i>One of the best moments
of my entire life.</i>

01:35.146 --> 01:36.328
<i>Only rave left...</i>

01:36.329 --> 01:38.563
<i>I actually threw
events for my first time</i>

01:38.564 --> 01:40.884
<i>'cause I wanted somewhere
for me and my friends to go</i>

01:40.885 --> 01:41.866
<i>to have a good time.</i>

01:41.867 --> 01:43.801
I thought of it being big,

01:43.802 --> 01:45.908
but I never thought
of it being this big.

01:56.565 --> 01:59.250
<i>Electric Daisy Carnival is
so many different things.</i>

01:59.251 --> 02:01.486
<i>People are
coming here to be inspired.</i>

02:01.487 --> 02:03.588
<i>- It's a music event.
- It's an art show.</i>

02:03.589 --> 02:05.823
<i>If you go back to
the purpose of cathedrals</i>

02:05.824 --> 02:07.104
<i>and what people were going for,</i>

02:07.105 --> 02:11.416
<i>it was to feel small
and spiritually alive.</i>

02:17.303 --> 02:20.672
<i>We have a small city,
115,000 people,</i>

02:20.673 --> 02:23.808
<i>which is larger than
some towns in America.</i>

02:23.809 --> 02:27.679
<i>You can build a sick production.
You can have the best DJ.</i>

02:27.680 --> 02:31.349
<i>But it is way more magical</i>

02:31.350 --> 02:34.219
<i>when you bring the people in,</i>

02:34.220 --> 02:36.588
<i>and their energy
and their costumes.</i>

02:36.589 --> 02:38.589
<i>That's what takes
it to the next level.</i>

04:30.002 --> 04:32.804
<i>I'm 19 years old
and I'm from Forney, Texas.</i>

04:32.805 --> 04:35.016
<i>There's not really much
going on in Forney.</i>

04:35.674 --> 04:37.675
<i>No one knows what EDC is.</i>

04:37.676 --> 04:40.411
<i>Here it's country music,
and Christian music</i>

04:40.412 --> 04:41.982
and Lil Wayne, that's it.

04:43.773 --> 04:45.142
<i>I was always bullied a lot</i>

04:45.143 --> 04:46.684
<i>because me and the
friends that I had</i>

04:46.685 --> 04:47.952
<i>were kind of different.</i>

04:47.953 --> 04:49.487
<i>It made me feel
kind of depressed</i>

04:49.488 --> 04:52.790
<i>and I felt there was no reason
to even talk to people.</i>

04:52.791 --> 04:56.963
<i>And that was when I started getting
into EDM music and rave culture.</i>

04:57.963 --> 05:00.598
That music changed
who I was as a person

05:00.599 --> 05:03.939
and completely changed my
outlook on life and everything.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.374
<i>I still got lots of internal
struggles going on.</i>

05:09.375 --> 05:11.509
<i>I'm dealing with
lots of anxiety.</i>

05:11.510 --> 05:13.811
<i>And I can't even drive yet
because of my anxiety.</i>

05:13.812 --> 05:15.313
<i>But going out to EDC,</i>

05:15.314 --> 05:17.749
<i>I can forget about all my
worries for a little while.</i>

05:17.750 --> 05:21.386
Maybe I'll get all that
pent-up stress out of me.

05:21.387 --> 05:25.857
Okay, Google Now, EDC
2013 Las Vegas lineup.

05:25.858 --> 05:27.961
<i>Check out these pictures.</i>

05:28.961 --> 05:31.429
So Above & Beyond is playing

05:31.430 --> 05:33.664
at Kinetic Field Sunday night.

05:33.665 --> 05:35.933
I'm not going to miss them.

05:35.934 --> 05:40.471
<i>I've never been to EDC. I've never
even been to a massive rave event.</i>

05:40.472 --> 05:42.240
Oh, my gosh, he's here.

05:42.241 --> 05:45.543
<i>Paying for college out of my own
pocket, it's been really difficult.</i>

05:45.544 --> 05:47.578
Hey!

05:47.579 --> 05:48.579
<i>I'm super broke,</i>

05:49.014 --> 05:51.549
<i>so my boyfriend surprised
me with my EDC tickets.</i>

05:51.550 --> 05:52.550
- You ready?
- Yes!

05:54.030 --> 05:55.820
<i>Missing EDC wasn't
going to happen.</i>

05:55.821 --> 05:57.555
<i>I was going to walk if I had to.</i>

05:57.556 --> 06:00.625
I looked up the directions
and it was about 443 hours,

06:00.626 --> 06:02.960
and I was prepared to make
that walk if we had to do it.

06:02.961 --> 06:04.829
Bye, house.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.171
I'm so excited!

06:12.171 --> 06:13.805
Load 'em up!

06:13.806 --> 06:15.039
<i>We're going to
Electric Daisy Carnival,</i>

06:15.040 --> 06:16.360
and we're driving across country

06:16.361 --> 06:17.761
all the way from Cape Cod, Mass.

06:17.762 --> 06:18.976
<i>We're going to be all piled</i>

06:18.977 --> 06:20.257
- <i>in Jjay's aunt's RV.</i>
- Whoo!

06:20.258 --> 06:22.079
<i>We all pretty much
put our jobs on hold.</i>

06:22.080 --> 06:23.848
<i>I had a great job.</i>

06:23.849 --> 06:25.783
<i>Kind of broke up
with my girlfriend.</i>

06:25.784 --> 06:28.619
I left everything just
to go on this adventure.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.621
One nice shirt for the trip.

06:30.622 --> 06:32.460
We're going to Vegas.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.993
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi.

06:35.994 --> 06:37.595
<i>So I got passport...</i>

06:37.596 --> 06:38.930
EDC tickets.

06:38.931 --> 06:40.231
EDC tickets on...

06:40.232 --> 06:41.699
The EDC tickets are in the bag.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.201
I live in Tokyo, Japan.

06:43.202 --> 06:46.037
<i>It was always my life's dream
to move over to Tokyo,</i>

06:46.038 --> 06:49.040
<i>and I actually got this position
at a large Internet company</i>

06:49.041 --> 06:51.142
<i>and it was too good to pass up.</i>

06:51.143 --> 06:52.977
I just graduated from college,

06:52.978 --> 06:57.648
<i>and I'm about to start a job at a cancer
research center in New York City.</i>

06:57.649 --> 07:00.485
<i>This is the best thing that I
could be doing for my career.</i>

07:00.486 --> 07:03.254
<i>I've been with Jim for a year.</i>

07:03.255 --> 07:05.215
<i>But we haven't seen each
other in six months.</i>

07:05.216 --> 07:08.125
<i>We're two days, 15 hours
and three minutes</i>

07:08.126 --> 07:10.164
<i>away from seeing one another.</i>

07:12.164 --> 07:14.599
<i>EDC, it's uplifting.</i>

07:14.600 --> 07:16.267
You let go of everything you got

07:16.268 --> 07:19.136
going on at home, work, school.

07:19.137 --> 07:20.805
<i>All your stress,
all your worries.</i>

07:20.806 --> 07:22.307
<i>Leave it all behind.</i>

07:22.308 --> 07:25.743
<i>During the daytime, I take
care of my little nephew.</i>

07:25.744 --> 07:27.044
<i>He's five years old.</i>

07:27.045 --> 07:29.914
Do you like the type
of music Popito likes?

07:29.915 --> 07:31.516
- No.
- No?

07:31.517 --> 07:33.918
- Why? What's wrong with it?
- Why not?

07:33.919 --> 07:35.987
When I listen to his
music, I can't breathe.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.108
You can't breathe?
Why not?

07:37.109 --> 07:38.229
You're holding your breath?

07:38.230 --> 07:40.913
How? What happens
when you listen to...

07:44.899 --> 07:46.531
<i>Right now I'm just finishing up</i>

07:46.532 --> 07:47.812
<i>getting my high school diploma,</i>

07:47.813 --> 07:49.713
<i>'cause I've been out
of school for a while</i>

07:49.714 --> 07:51.969
<i>due to my health complications.</i>

07:51.970 --> 07:53.286
<i>That was very hard on me.</i>

07:53.605 --> 07:56.286
But the first time I listened
to electronic dance music,

07:56.287 --> 07:57.424
<i>I was really amazed.</i>

07:59.011 --> 08:00.945
<i>It makes me happy.</i>

08:00.946 --> 08:04.219
<i>It keeps me going.
It keeps me motivated.</i>

08:07.219 --> 08:08.686
Alley-oop.

08:08.687 --> 08:09.987
Oh!

08:09.988 --> 08:12.857
We have to brush
our teeth with beer.

08:12.858 --> 08:14.659
It's like this...

08:14.660 --> 08:15.963
Here you go.

08:17.963 --> 08:19.735
Shotgun!

08:26.138 --> 08:29.106
Brother, what,
that's still half full!

08:29.107 --> 08:30.792
- Down we go, fellas.
- Let's go.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.046
12:35 and we're on
the road finally.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.714
I kind of got stuck driving,

08:36.715 --> 08:38.982
so I really can't drink,

08:38.984 --> 08:40.787
which is a bummer right now.

08:41.513 --> 08:42.986
There's a whole bunch of us,

08:42.988 --> 08:44.689
but only a couple
of us actually have

08:44.690 --> 08:46.223
licenses to make this drive.

08:46.224 --> 08:47.858
We got McBride right here.

08:47.859 --> 08:49.126
We got Money Mike in the back.

08:49.127 --> 08:50.628
Big Bob for security.

08:50.629 --> 08:52.196
We got Luan, aka Disco Drop.

08:52.197 --> 08:53.831
He's going to drop some tunes.

08:53.832 --> 08:56.635
So I say crank that
shit up, big boy.

09:01.393 --> 09:02.920
<i>My artist name is Disco Drop.</i>

09:03.008 --> 09:04.309
And to be out here as a DJ,

09:04.310 --> 09:06.870
I go to these shows 'cause I know
one day I'm gonna be onstage,

09:06.871 --> 09:10.077
<i>on that main stage, and I promise
everybody I will do that.</i>

09:12.937 --> 09:14.885
And last but not least,
we got our boy

09:14.886 --> 09:16.486
Michael Ferris, alpha
male, right here.

09:16.487 --> 09:20.066
He's with us the whole time. We're
going to bring him to EDC with us.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.660
<i>Michael Ferris
was like a brother to me</i>

09:22.661 --> 09:24.662
<i>and the rest of the Wolfpack.</i>

09:24.663 --> 09:26.397
<i>He died two months ago.</i>

09:26.398 --> 09:28.299
<i>I was taking finals
in law school.</i>

09:28.300 --> 09:31.202
<i>And not only did I spend
every day with him at school,</i>

09:31.203 --> 09:32.903
<i>I lived with him last summer.</i>

09:32.904 --> 09:38.142
And it really was incredibly
difficult for me.

09:38.143 --> 09:40.383
And this is going to come with
us the whole way to Vegas.

09:40.384 --> 09:41.312
The whole way to Vegas.

09:41.313 --> 09:42.753
Might as well hang
this up right here

09:42.754 --> 09:43.994
right next to the wolf blanket.

09:43.995 --> 09:45.357
You know what I'm saying?

09:47.586 --> 09:51.222
Ferris started the Wolfpack
name and the whole idea of it,

09:51.223 --> 09:53.750
and his outgoing personality
brought us together.

09:53.950 --> 09:56.346
<i>All of us were supposed to go
to EDC Las Vegas this summer.</i>

09:56.347 --> 09:57.962
<i>Just tear it up.
Wolfpack in Vegas.</i>

09:57.963 --> 10:00.603
<i>And he started this. It's not</i> The Hangover.
<i>It's not nonsense.</i>

10:00.604 --> 10:02.099
<i>We're the original Wolfpack.</i>

10:02.100 --> 10:04.381
Let's hang this bad boy up
right here for him, you know?

10:04.382 --> 10:05.803
The alpha male of the Wolfpack.

10:05.804 --> 10:08.207
He made us the animals
that we are today.

10:09.207 --> 10:11.042
Boom! Number one.

10:11.043 --> 10:13.818
One, two, three.
Wolfpack!

10:19.818 --> 10:22.219
<i>In one hour and one
minute, Jim lands,</i>

10:22.220 --> 10:26.691
and we get to start our
magical EDC weekend together.

10:26.692 --> 10:30.094
<i>Jim and I really, really
want to be in the same city,</i>

10:30.095 --> 10:33.431
<i>but we both wanted each
other to live our dreams,</i>

10:33.432 --> 10:35.272
<i>even if it made things
harder for both of us,</i>

10:35.273 --> 10:39.110
<i>'cause that's what will make our
partnership stronger in the end.</i>

10:39.971 --> 10:41.405
He texted me.

10:41.406 --> 10:43.340
He landed.

10:43.341 --> 10:45.409
<i>It's not going to be
real until I see him.</i>

10:45.410 --> 10:48.851
<i>I don't believe that he's
going to be here at all.</i>

10:52.851 --> 10:54.971
Ready for EDC!
Yes!

11:12.971 --> 11:16.242
Are you ready for the best
weekend of your entire life?

11:17.242 --> 11:18.709
Yeah.

11:18.710 --> 11:21.013
<i>Jim and I have three,
four days together.</i>

11:21.692 --> 11:24.482
<i>We want to maximize our
experience in those four days.</i>

11:24.483 --> 11:26.784
- Isn't it nice?
- Oh, my God!

11:26.785 --> 11:28.155
Jesus!

11:29.755 --> 11:32.195
<i>We're really looking
forward to the Ferris wheel.</i>

11:32.196 --> 11:33.491
It's every raver's dream

11:33.492 --> 11:35.598
to kiss on top of the
Ferris wheel, so...

11:45.403 --> 11:47.905
<i>My goal is to
make the event better.</i>

11:47.906 --> 11:51.175
I want it to be epic,
as it was for me.

11:51.176 --> 11:55.045
<i>When I went to my first
underground rave, it was magical.</i>

11:55.046 --> 11:58.415
<i>Everyone was dancing. People were
dressed in all different ways.</i>

11:58.416 --> 12:03.554
People weren't tripping on
the guy that was different.

12:03.555 --> 12:06.924
<i>That's what really grabbed me,
the energy behind the culture.</i>

12:06.925 --> 12:10.060
<i>So, that's why, for EDC,</i>

12:10.061 --> 12:11.341
<i>we really said, "You know what?</i>

12:11.342 --> 12:13.464
<i>"Let's take it to
another level."</i>

12:13.465 --> 12:15.466
<i>On stage one alone,
almost every piece of</i>

12:15.467 --> 12:17.101
<i>scaffolding on the west coast.</i>

12:17.102 --> 12:18.236
<i>500-foot stage.</i>

12:18.237 --> 12:19.837
<i>We've never done
a production this big.</i>

12:19.838 --> 12:21.038
<i>There are seven stages.</i>

12:21.039 --> 12:22.640
<i>Over 500 performers.</i>

12:22.641 --> 12:25.509
<i>Tickets for the event sold
out very quickly this year.</i>

12:25.510 --> 12:28.412
<i>Three hundred forty-five thousand
people bought tickets for EDC</i>

12:28.413 --> 12:32.917
<i>before we even
announced the DJs.</i>

12:32.918 --> 12:36.353
<i>People travel far and spend
all their money to be here.</i>

12:36.354 --> 12:38.422
<i>This is about them,</i>

12:38.423 --> 12:39.924
<i>not who's on stage.</i>

12:39.925 --> 12:42.359
<i>I mean, the fans
are the headliners.</i>

12:42.360 --> 12:44.862
<i>That's how I truly believe,
they're that important.</i>

12:44.863 --> 12:46.497
<i>I want them to know it.</i>

12:46.498 --> 12:50.234
So, I don't want to not deliver.

12:50.235 --> 12:53.170
In order to make this sound
as good as it can sound,

12:53.171 --> 12:54.131
what are you proposing?

12:54.132 --> 12:57.041
The towers would
have to be at 180 feet.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.209
Okay.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.310
And why are we debating

12:59.311 --> 13:00.511
whether to do something
that's going to

13:00.512 --> 13:02.046
make sure the sound is awesome?

13:02.047 --> 13:03.114
The aesthetics.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.516
If you can't see a speaker,
you can't hear it.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.317
We can't not have the
sound booming, you know?

13:07.318 --> 13:08.252
These ones are in line

13:08.253 --> 13:09.820
with the main arrays,
aren't they?

13:09.821 --> 13:12.323
<i>Yeah, it's quite normal for
Pasquale to be making changes</i>

13:12.324 --> 13:13.798
<i>up until the doors are open.</i>

13:14.025 --> 13:16.627
He's definitely a perfectionist.

13:16.628 --> 13:17.929
Do we want to dress 'em up?

13:17.930 --> 13:20.397
Not dress them up, but I would
like fire coming off the top.

13:20.398 --> 13:22.633
Or pyro coming off the top.

13:22.634 --> 13:24.436
How do you feel?

13:25.537 --> 13:27.339
Let's do it.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.074
It's not really possible

13:30.075 --> 13:31.942
to win an argument with Pasquale

13:31.943 --> 13:33.611
by saying it's too much money.

13:33.612 --> 13:36.881
<i>One of the principles of Insomniac
is everything is possible.</i>

13:36.882 --> 13:38.549
If something is expensive,

13:38.550 --> 13:40.050
then you just have to figure out

13:40.051 --> 13:41.331
how you're going to pay for it.

13:41.332 --> 13:43.954
It's pretty badass.

13:43.955 --> 13:47.026
<i>I hope that people
walk in and they're wowed,</i>

13:47.828 --> 13:49.828
<i>and they see things
they didn't expect,</i>

13:50.028 --> 13:51.395
<i>and they live in the moment</i>

13:51.396 --> 13:52.997
and they're happy, right?

13:52.998 --> 13:54.632
Life is about being happy.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.500
I'd like her to walk by

13:56.501 --> 13:58.541
and the owl turns its
head with the heart eyes.

13:58.542 --> 13:59.542
We got to get that.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.341
I love his eyebrows.

14:04.342 --> 14:05.910
<i>Pasquale came by tonight...</i>

14:05.911 --> 14:08.178
Let's lace all this with rides.

14:08.179 --> 14:10.147
...and basically moved
everything around.

14:10.148 --> 14:11.348
This doesn't work.

14:11.349 --> 14:13.417
This should all be art.

14:13.418 --> 14:15.821
Every time something gets
moved, it costs more money.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.255
<i>Why did we
shorten this? Why...</i>

14:18.256 --> 14:19.976
There's not enough pieces
because you used

14:19.977 --> 14:21.591
the pieces over there.

14:21.927 --> 14:24.428
There's no LEDs left in
North America right now.

14:24.429 --> 14:26.630
They're all here.

14:26.631 --> 14:30.334
So, the Electric Daisy Carnival
now less than 24 hours away

14:30.335 --> 14:32.404
and many ravers are
flooding into town.

14:40.078 --> 14:41.218
Turn the bass up!

14:46.952 --> 14:49.058
<i>I didn't feel like I
belonged to anything</i>

14:49.059 --> 14:51.655
until I found rave culture
and electronic dance music.

14:51.656 --> 14:54.235
And I knew instantly this
is me, this is who I am.

14:56.461 --> 14:58.562
<i>EDM is not a fad for us.</i>

14:58.563 --> 14:59.864
<i>It's a lifestyle.</i>

14:59.865 --> 15:03.737
I wake up to EDM. I got to sleep to EDM.
Dusk till dawn, EDM.

15:05.737 --> 15:08.505
<i>We're a rave family. We're
all together as a group.</i>

15:08.506 --> 15:09.786
<i>It's like an open relationship</i>

15:09.787 --> 15:11.187
<i>and everybody is
seeing everybody.</i>

15:11.188 --> 15:13.510
<i>Some people don't
accept us for that.</i>

15:13.511 --> 15:17.083
<i>When we're all together,
we can all be ourselves.</i>

15:19.083 --> 15:21.151
<i>We have our careers
that we do, right?</i>

15:21.152 --> 15:23.253
- I'm a registered nurse.
- I'm a stripper.

15:23.254 --> 15:25.225
I'm a fireman.
Yeah.

15:26.825 --> 15:29.426
There will be other firefighters
there that I know of.

15:29.427 --> 15:31.547
- It's always funny. I walk by them at raves
- Whoo!

15:31.548 --> 15:33.530
And they look at me like,
"Oh, you freak!"

15:33.531 --> 15:35.132
And I'm like, "You
don't even know.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.434
"I'm one of you."

15:37.435 --> 15:39.703
We're all going to get
married in Vegas.

15:39.704 --> 15:41.138
To each other!

15:41.139 --> 15:42.540
Sorry, Mom.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.511
You have to tie it to that hook.

15:47.512 --> 15:50.383
Like this. Just
completely tie it.

15:51.383 --> 15:52.483
Like this?

15:52.484 --> 15:54.284
But it has to get in.

15:54.285 --> 15:56.720
<i>These bracelets
are called Kandi.</i>

15:56.721 --> 15:59.790
<i>Usually at EDC
you'll exchange Kandi.</i>

15:59.791 --> 16:02.126
Kandi is mostly like fun to me.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.812
So I think you're
exchanging fun.

16:04.580 --> 16:05.896
I told you to tighten it.

16:05.897 --> 16:08.032
Mom! Mom! I'm trying to teach him.
I'm trying to teach him.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.873
- Well, I can help, too.
- No, I'm trying to...

16:09.874 --> 16:11.308
How do you think you learned?

16:11.309 --> 16:13.537
<i>Fifteen years ago, Alli
took me to my first EDC.</i>

16:13.538 --> 16:15.898
That's the first time I fell
in love with her, that night.

16:15.899 --> 16:17.441
It was just one of those things

16:17.442 --> 16:19.176
<i>where you just know,
"That's the one."</i>

16:19.177 --> 16:20.377
<i>Yes, we have two kids.</i>

16:20.378 --> 16:22.713
I made the own tie. You didn't
teach me how to tie this.

16:22.714 --> 16:26.082
<i>Our family, of course, is
just not traditional at all.</i>

16:26.083 --> 16:29.720
<i>Our kids are only 15 and 12, so
they're not allowed to go to EDC yet.</i>

16:29.721 --> 16:32.289
<i>We hope one day that the
kids can join us at EDC.</i>

16:32.290 --> 16:35.448
<i>They're going to experience
energy they've never felt before.</i>

16:36.182 --> 16:37.761
<i>We actually never got married.</i>

16:37.762 --> 16:40.002
<i>So when we went back to EDC
last year for the first time,</i>

16:40.003 --> 16:41.265
<i>I looked at her and I'm like,</i>

16:41.266 --> 16:42.599
<i>"You know what? Let's get
married there next year."</i>

16:42.600 --> 16:44.334
- She goes...
- "Let's do it!"

16:44.335 --> 16:45.904
And, um, that's
what we're doing.

16:46.104 --> 16:47.477
Ooh!

16:55.380 --> 16:56.582
Hello, Vegas!

16:57.582 --> 16:59.616
Oh! Look at
all the awesome!

16:59.617 --> 17:01.355
It's everywhere!

17:04.355 --> 17:05.856
We're in Vegas!

17:05.857 --> 17:08.392
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

17:08.393 --> 17:10.227
We made it! Vegas!

17:10.228 --> 17:12.463
3,000 miles, big boy!

17:12.464 --> 17:14.464
3,000 miles!
We're here now!

17:14.465 --> 17:16.151
And he didn't
drive a single one!

17:20.105 --> 17:21.338
Let's do it.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.739
Crazy lights,
toys, Kandi. Guns.

17:22.740 --> 17:23.840
Check.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.209
Check, check, check.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.277
- Check. Whoo!
- Oh!

17:27.579 --> 17:29.246
What is that?
Your prom dress?

17:29.247 --> 17:32.216
Yes. This was my
senior prom dress.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.552
<i>My dad wanted me to bring
my grandfather's ashes</i>

17:35.553 --> 17:37.688
in a pill bottle keychain.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.389
He was like, "Your grandpa
would love to be doing that.

17:39.390 --> 17:41.125
"He went and did all kinds
of things like that."

17:41.126 --> 17:42.526
<i>I don't know if I can get it in.</i>

17:42.527 --> 17:43.660
They're going to be like,
"Oh, this is drugs."

17:43.661 --> 17:45.021
They're going to
want to taste him.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.364
"Oh, my gosh! That's my
grandfather's ashes! You can't."

17:47.365 --> 17:49.333
They'll open it and a
gust of wind comes,

17:49.334 --> 17:50.703
and there goes my grandpa.

17:57.909 --> 18:00.189
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Almost.

18:00.190 --> 18:02.779
- Are you excited?
- So excited.

18:02.780 --> 18:05.202
Okay, so I can go through now?
Okay, thank you.

18:08.219 --> 18:11.822
<i>Rides, girls, music, dancing.</i>

18:11.823 --> 18:13.224
Let's do it!

18:13.225 --> 18:15.626
<i>You get there and you
just feel the bass.</i>

18:15.627 --> 18:17.895
And you're like,
"I know this song."

18:17.896 --> 18:19.901
We're here.

18:22.901 --> 18:25.402
<i>I play music
for all of the people</i>

18:25.403 --> 18:27.638
<i>that don't know where
they fit in in the world.</i>

18:27.639 --> 18:29.273
Oh, my God!
I'm so excited.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.641
I'm with them.
And I was a raver

18:30.642 --> 18:33.243
long before I was a DJ.

18:33.244 --> 18:35.579
Oh, my God.
I'm getting chills.

18:35.580 --> 18:36.580
Oh, my God!

18:37.348 --> 18:38.348
Look at this!

18:39.284 --> 18:40.751
Look at this!

18:40.752 --> 18:42.452
Here we go!

18:42.453 --> 18:44.188
<i>These are all
the kids that ate lunch</i>

18:44.189 --> 18:45.689
<i>by themselves in high school.</i>

18:45.690 --> 18:47.457
<i>These are the loners.</i>

18:47.458 --> 18:50.260
<i>And they stumbled upon
this, and they went,</i>

18:50.261 --> 18:52.537
"Whoa! I belong here!"

18:59.412 --> 19:01.939
<i>I started crying when we
walked through the door.</i>

19:01.940 --> 19:04.741
I didn't think it was going
to be this crazy, but it is.

19:04.742 --> 19:07.703
Oh, my God! I have to go down
there and meet my friends.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.771
- Morning! How are ya?
- Here we go. EDC!

19:34.772 --> 19:37.374
<i>This is not just an event.
It's a cultural movement.</i>

19:37.375 --> 19:40.586
It's all very positive. It's
almost like Woodstock reinvented.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.465
<i>What's up, EDC!</i>

20:00.465 --> 20:02.266
<i>Are you guys ready to go crazy?</i>

20:02.267 --> 20:04.434
<i>Are you guys ready to
write history tonight?</i>

20:04.435 --> 20:06.067
<i>Let me show some hands.
Come on!</i>

20:39.905 --> 20:41.785
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

20:41.786 --> 20:44.841
No. I'm absolutely
gobsmacked.

20:44.842 --> 20:47.878
<i>This is history
being made right now.</i>

20:47.879 --> 20:49.880
<i>We're involved in it.</i>

20:49.881 --> 20:51.982
It must be a religious
experience

20:51.983 --> 20:55.322
almost to get here
for every dance lover.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.722
<i>Of course
I'm excited about playing,</i>

20:58.723 --> 21:00.224
<i>but I'm more excited
about being here.</i>

21:00.225 --> 21:03.265
<i>After I finish, it's not like I go
back to my hotel and go to sleep. No.</i>

21:03.266 --> 21:05.462
I go and I watch Knife Party.
I watch their show.

21:05.463 --> 21:06.964
<i>I go crazy.</i>

21:32.290 --> 21:35.125
<i>Three hundred thousand people
going for the same reason.</i>

21:35.126 --> 21:36.827
<i>Everybody is getting
away from home.</i>

21:36.828 --> 21:38.428
<i>They're going on
this big vacation.</i>

21:38.429 --> 21:40.864
<i>They're going to get away
from all their problems.</i>

21:40.865 --> 21:43.497
<i>And everybody is there
under the same electric sky.</i>

22:18.469 --> 22:19.970
I love you!

22:19.971 --> 22:22.550
<i>- EDC, thank you so much!
- I love you! Thank you!</i>

22:27.011 --> 22:28.812
Whoo!

22:28.813 --> 22:31.114
This is so cool!

22:31.115 --> 22:32.816
Three days of this!

22:32.817 --> 22:34.117
Three days!

22:34.118 --> 22:35.660
Whoo!

22:42.660 --> 22:44.030
<i>Before this beat kicks in,</i>

22:46.030 --> 22:47.504
<i>I just want to tell you guys</i>

22:49.200 --> 22:52.471
<i>tonight is not about me
or any of the other DJs.</i>

22:53.471 --> 22:55.441
<i>It is all about you guys.</i>

22:56.441 --> 22:58.208
<i>It is about EDC!</i>

22:58.209 --> 22:59.783
<i>Make some noise!</i>

24:01.272 --> 24:03.039
This place
is massive. Jeez!

24:03.040 --> 24:04.841
Stick together, boys.

24:04.842 --> 24:06.790
If you get lost,
we meet at the daisy.

24:07.111 --> 24:08.645
Whoa! And it's moving!
Okay.

24:08.646 --> 24:11.114
Dude, that's a terrible idea!

24:11.115 --> 24:13.183
Where are you going
to meet under the daisy?

24:13.184 --> 24:15.252
At the base of the daisy.

24:15.253 --> 24:17.087
- Don't get lost. Problem solved.
- Yeah.

24:17.088 --> 24:18.648
Okay, so now we're
going to the daisy?

24:18.649 --> 24:19.649
Yeah.

24:20.124 --> 24:21.193
It's more fun here.

24:22.193 --> 24:23.560
Can we party now or what?

24:23.561 --> 24:24.968
Yeah, let's go!

24:30.968 --> 24:33.270
<i>I like to
call us, um, old candy.</i>

24:33.271 --> 24:34.905
Pull up your pants.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.307
Pull your pants up.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.069
You know, like, you have those
candy ravers, we're the old candy.

24:39.070 --> 24:42.279
You know that kind of candy you get
when you go to Grandma's house?

24:42.280 --> 24:44.881
That's all stuck
together? That's us.

24:44.882 --> 24:47.817
Just in case there
is no toilet paper,

24:47.818 --> 24:50.258
- and you're not into it...
- Or someone pees on the toilet.

24:50.259 --> 24:50.954
There you go.

24:50.955 --> 24:52.856
It's wipeys.

24:52.857 --> 24:54.158
<i>'Cause we're parents</i>

24:54.159 --> 24:56.726
and we like to take care of
everybody like they're our babies.

24:56.727 --> 24:59.162
<i>Yeah, just show them how to
do it when they get older.</i>

24:59.163 --> 25:00.964
<i>It's part of
the whole PLUR thing.</i>

25:00.965 --> 25:02.699
<i>Peace, love, unity and respect.</i>

25:02.700 --> 25:04.601
Everybody wants
respect and the unity,

25:04.602 --> 25:06.736
to make sure everybody
is having a good time.

25:06.737 --> 25:09.264
- Keep it going, guys!
- Have a good night, guys!

25:12.076 --> 25:13.643
<i>Basically, night one,</i>

25:13.644 --> 25:16.246
<i>we walk around and we kind of
get the feel of the grounds.</i>

25:16.247 --> 25:18.248
<i>See what changed
from the year before.</i>

25:18.249 --> 25:20.150
<i>You map it out
so you don't get lost.</i>

25:20.151 --> 25:21.688
Yeah! Yeah!

25:23.614 --> 25:26.088
<i>Usually you have a few DJs
that you want to see,</i>

25:26.089 --> 25:29.195
<i>a few different people back and
forth from different stages.</i>

25:49.347 --> 25:51.874
<i>You're the one in control
of what you want to do.</i>

25:51.875 --> 25:53.595
<i>No one is going to
tell you where to go,</i>

25:53.596 --> 25:54.718
<i>who to listen to.</i>

25:54.719 --> 25:56.620
<i>You make your adventure.</i>

25:56.621 --> 25:58.990
<i>Some people take
it a little too far.</i>

26:27.118 --> 26:31.154
We've always had a zero tolerance
policy when it comes to drugs.

26:31.155 --> 26:32.956
<i>We're an
18-and-over event.</i>

26:32.957 --> 26:37.160
<i>But there's always people who try and
see what they can get away with.</i>

26:37.161 --> 26:40.296
<i>And we're here to pick up
the pieces if that happens.</i>

26:40.297 --> 26:43.098
Hey, guys.
You okay?

26:43.099 --> 26:45.669
A big part of my job
is looking for people

26:45.670 --> 26:47.438
who might need
medical attention.

26:52.209 --> 26:53.910
What year is it?

26:53.911 --> 26:54.944
2013.

26:54.945 --> 26:56.412
There you go!

26:56.413 --> 26:58.915
<i>We've had some unfortunate
incidents over the years</i>

26:58.916 --> 27:01.050
<i>at Electric Daisy Carnival.</i>

27:01.051 --> 27:02.686
It's rough for all
of our team whenever

27:02.687 --> 27:04.447
we have to deal with
something like that.

27:04.448 --> 27:05.388
We take it personally.

27:05.389 --> 27:07.691
<i>We work so hard to be proactive</i>

27:07.692 --> 27:10.226
<i>and to provide the best
possible medical care.</i>

27:10.227 --> 27:13.430
<i>Um, sometimes somebody
just makes a poor decision,</i>

27:13.431 --> 27:15.431
<i>and we just do
the best we can with it.</i>

27:17.873 --> 27:19.295
<i>If you want to go do drugs,</i>

27:19.296 --> 27:21.104
<i>that's your own
prerogative. I'm not...</i>

27:21.105 --> 27:22.505
<i>That's your own thing, you know?</i>

27:22.506 --> 27:25.108
- Do you use drugs?
- I do not use drugs.

27:25.109 --> 27:28.882
Why? Well, for number one, I had a
friend who died from a drug overdose.

27:31.882 --> 27:34.422
<i>For Ferris to go
the way he did, was...</i>

27:38.422 --> 27:40.290
I can't even come
up with the words

27:40.291 --> 27:42.392
to really describe how it felt.

27:42.393 --> 27:44.494
That's Ferris right there.

27:44.495 --> 27:46.229
He's like, "Welcome
to my playground, boys."

27:46.230 --> 27:47.264
<i>Yeah, right?</i>

27:47.265 --> 27:48.385
<i>I don't need to use drugs.</i>

27:48.386 --> 27:49.786
<i>Some people, they feel they need</i>

27:49.787 --> 27:51.468
<i>to take drugs to
escape their reality.</i>

27:51.469 --> 27:53.109
<i>My reality is
pretty awesome as it is,</i>

27:53.110 --> 27:55.038
- <i>so I don't need to do any of that.</i>
- Yeah!

27:55.039 --> 27:56.445
I love it!

28:01.445 --> 28:06.916
<i>Electronic dance music, that,
for me, it's like a therapy.</i>

28:06.917 --> 28:08.117
It's my escape.

28:08.118 --> 28:11.955
Actually, you can say it's my
drug, and music is my drug.

28:11.956 --> 28:15.225
It helps me cope with the
things I got to go through.

28:15.226 --> 28:18.029
<i>Before EDC, I wasn't
doing so good.</i>

28:19.029 --> 28:22.899
<i>I used to dwell a lot on the
past, and being able to walk.</i>

28:22.900 --> 28:28.037
<i>I have scoliosis. I had
surgery about six years ago.</i>

28:28.038 --> 28:31.474
<i>And a doctor damaged
my spinal cord somehow.</i>

28:31.475 --> 28:33.245
<i>I couldn't walk anymore.</i>

28:34.245 --> 28:37.046
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

28:37.047 --> 28:40.850
<i>There's definitely challenges that I
face when I go to these festivals.</i>

28:40.851 --> 28:43.792
<i>For me to get through
a crowd is a hassle.</i>

28:47.792 --> 28:50.226
<i>Yeah, you have your
ADA platforms and whatnot,</i>

28:50.227 --> 28:52.462
<i>but I don't like
being on a platform,</i>

28:52.463 --> 28:54.297
<i>I like being
a part of the crowd,</i>

28:54.298 --> 28:57.802
<i>even if I might not
get to see the stage.</i>

29:23.160 --> 29:25.361
We got this.
We're not old candy.

29:25.362 --> 29:27.163
We're going home a little early.

29:27.164 --> 29:28.398
It's been a night?

29:28.399 --> 29:29.557
Oh, yeah, crazy night.

29:32.948 --> 29:34.370
Hold on, we got to stretch.

29:34.371 --> 29:36.840
<i>You can't just go
full-out the first night.</i>

29:36.841 --> 29:38.473
It's all about pacing yourself.

30:01.999 --> 30:04.137
EDC!

31:27.484 --> 31:29.955
How are you still so pumped?

31:30.955 --> 31:32.488
<i>EDC day one is over.</i>

31:32.489 --> 31:35.091
<i>I'm with new people.
I'm meeting new people.</i>

31:35.092 --> 31:36.935
<i>It doesn't get any
better than this.</i>

31:38.195 --> 31:42.065
Day one of three, we had
about 100,000 people.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.968
Got two more sunrises to go.

31:44.969 --> 31:46.489
<i>We're trying to
get everybody home.</i>

31:46.490 --> 31:50.440
<i>We're transporting about
35,000 people on shuttles.</i>

31:50.441 --> 31:52.075
<i>Day two is coming up.</i>

31:52.076 --> 31:54.477
<i>And if it's just
as good as day one,</i>

31:54.478 --> 31:55.878
- <i>if not better...
- It will be.</i>

31:55.879 --> 31:57.879
<i>...then I'm going
to be stoked on life.</i>

32:08.492 --> 32:10.460
Oh, my God.
I'm so beat.

32:10.461 --> 32:11.461
Oh!
That was fun.

32:12.029 --> 32:13.331
Day one was crazy!

32:14.331 --> 32:16.134
Dude, I'm exhausted.

32:17.134 --> 32:18.537
We lost Luan.

32:20.537 --> 32:22.672
<i>We don't know where he is.</i>

32:22.673 --> 32:24.707
Don't know what happened to him.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.275
<i>His phone's off.</i>

32:26.276 --> 32:27.477
<i>At first, I was like, "All right.
We'll give him time."</i>

32:27.478 --> 32:29.779
<i>So we just go hang out
on the roof of the RV.</i>

32:29.780 --> 32:32.181
<i>We drink some beers,
we're laughing, hanging out.</i>

32:32.182 --> 32:33.649
<i>Half an hour
goes by, we're like,</i>

32:33.650 --> 32:35.284
<i>less and less people
in the parking lot.</i>

32:35.285 --> 32:36.845
So what are we going
to do about Luan?

32:36.846 --> 32:38.446
How much time are we
going to give him?

32:38.447 --> 32:40.254
I say we give him an hour.

32:41.258 --> 32:43.292
- 7:30. 7:30.
- Well, I'm leaving...

32:43.293 --> 32:45.495
Listen, Luan is a smart
enough kid

32:45.496 --> 32:47.630
to get himself
safely to shelter.

32:47.631 --> 32:49.265
What happens if he's in jail?

32:49.266 --> 32:50.633
Dude, he's not in jail.

32:50.634 --> 32:54.704
I'm hoping he's back in Vegas with
eight beautiful women at a hotel,

32:54.705 --> 32:56.072
waiting for us to get there.

32:56.073 --> 32:57.774
That's what I'm really hoping.

32:57.775 --> 32:59.242
Probably not.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.211
<i>All of a sudden
we get this call.</i>

33:01.212 --> 33:03.616
<i>He's just like,
"Yo, where are you?"</i>

33:05.616 --> 33:07.750
All right.
The main entrance?

33:07.751 --> 33:09.452
All right, we'll see you soon.

33:09.453 --> 33:11.654
Dude, he's been walking
around this whole parking lot

33:11.655 --> 33:13.175
all over on that
side looking for us.

33:13.176 --> 33:15.191
He didn't...
know where that thing was.

33:15.192 --> 33:17.326
He didn't know where it was.

33:17.327 --> 33:19.170
- For hours, dude? Wow!
- For hours.

33:20.097 --> 33:21.397
I think I see him.

33:21.398 --> 33:23.699
Yo, Luan!

33:23.700 --> 33:24.700
Yo!

33:27.604 --> 33:29.573
We've been over there.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.446
Where the hell are you even walking?
Like, we didn't leave you.

33:36.447 --> 33:38.247
- Right.
- Yeah, right.

33:38.248 --> 33:39.348
If you didn't leave me,

33:39.349 --> 33:40.650
I would've found you within
the first 30 minutes

33:40.651 --> 33:41.985
that I looked for you guys.

33:41.986 --> 33:44.220
You want me to tell you everything
that's around this... building?

33:44.221 --> 33:45.555
Dude, we didn't...
How'd I get here so fast?

33:45.556 --> 33:47.356
You want me to tell you
everything around this building?

33:47.357 --> 33:49.092
- Because I walked around and...
- Did you walk that far?

33:49.093 --> 33:51.360
I did. I crossed this parking
lot, that parking lot,

33:51.361 --> 33:52.841
this parking lot
and this parking lot.

33:52.842 --> 33:54.263
You guys were
nowhere to be found.

33:54.264 --> 33:55.465
Dude, it was way back there.

33:55.466 --> 33:57.186
Next time I'm driving,
I'll remember that.

33:57.187 --> 33:58.568
You're being emotional.

33:58.569 --> 34:00.529
You walked all the way
to that back parking lot?

34:00.530 --> 34:01.404
Yeah. Yeah.

34:01.405 --> 34:02.538
The truck was not there.

34:02.539 --> 34:04.540
We didn't move.

34:04.541 --> 34:06.109
You.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.479
We didn't move.

34:08.478 --> 34:09.478
Dude!

34:11.357 --> 34:12.514
He thinks we left him.

34:12.516 --> 34:13.520
We never left you.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.521
<i>Losing a friend
kind of sets your mind</i>

34:18.522 --> 34:22.125
<i>to not take for granted every
moment you have with a friend.</i>

34:22.126 --> 34:23.860
Let the little things slide off.

34:23.860 --> 34:26.395
You just enjoy and
live in the moment.

34:26.396 --> 34:29.532
<i>Ferris died right
before his 25th birthday.</i>

34:29.533 --> 34:30.813
<i>He's the last
person in the world</i>

34:30.813 --> 34:32.368
<i>you would think
for it to happen to.</i>

34:32.369 --> 34:34.337
He was so full
of energy and life.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.239
Let's turn this
thing right around.

34:36.239 --> 34:39.542
Just turn it right around,
go get some breakfast.

34:39.543 --> 34:41.463
<i>This bond is very
important to me, with Luan.</i>

34:41.464 --> 34:44.614
<i>We work so much together with music
that we can't hate each other</i>

34:44.614 --> 34:46.248
<i>'cause we built
this thing together.</i>

34:46.250 --> 34:47.951
<i>Our bond has to be strong.</i>

34:47.952 --> 34:50.753
<i>We're in Vegas, we're both trying
to make it somewhere in life.</i>

34:50.754 --> 34:53.188
I'm sorry, bro.
All right?

34:53.190 --> 34:55.591
Let's cheer up.
It's EDC week Vegas.

34:55.592 --> 34:58.301
Disco Drop, blow up.
Let's live life, bro.

35:29.526 --> 35:33.429
<i>We don't necessarily look like
someone you might call a raver.</i>

35:33.430 --> 35:38.201
No. We're very, very
conservative looking.

35:38.202 --> 35:41.604
<i>But EDM has consistently
made us very, very happy.</i>

35:41.605 --> 35:43.339
<i>Jim introduced me to this music.</i>

35:43.340 --> 35:47.476
<i>And actually one of our first dates
we went to an Avicii concert.</i>

35:47.477 --> 35:49.848
<i>Brought us
really close together.</i>

35:51.848 --> 35:55.551
<i>That heart-soaring,
uplifting kind of feeling</i>

35:55.552 --> 35:57.520
<i>you get when you
listen to that music,</i>

35:57.521 --> 36:00.323
<i>it's the same feeling
that I get with Jim.</i>

36:00.324 --> 36:02.834
This love that's
bigger than yourself.

36:10.834 --> 36:13.669
<i>The last day at EDC,
we were going to get married,</i>

36:13.670 --> 36:15.771
<i>so we went to a pool party,</i>

36:15.772 --> 36:18.853
<i>and it was our bachelor
and bachelorette party.</i>

36:29.853 --> 36:33.823
<i>I just love being in
my ideal rave world.</i>

36:33.824 --> 36:37.088
A place where people can be
themselves and be free of judgment.

36:40.931 --> 36:44.500
<i>A couple years ago I went to EDC
2010, and I was saying to myself,</i>

36:44.501 --> 36:47.837
<i>"Why can't I have this
experience at my house?"</i>

36:47.838 --> 36:50.312
<i>I basically created a rave cave.</i>

36:55.312 --> 36:57.682
This is our sensory
overload chamber.

36:58.682 --> 37:01.817
We got a smoke machine that
injects from the outside

37:01.818 --> 37:04.420
so you can see the laser.

37:04.421 --> 37:06.421
Have you had sex in here?

37:06.657 --> 37:08.559
About 1,000 times.

37:09.559 --> 37:10.559
Yeah, absolutely.

37:13.363 --> 37:15.464
<i>I've been a fireman
for eight years.</i>

37:15.465 --> 37:17.967
<i>My dad was actually chief
of the fire department,</i>

37:17.968 --> 37:20.503
<i>and that's all I saw
when I was growing up.</i>

37:20.504 --> 37:22.584
I will get made fun of
by the other firefighters.

37:22.585 --> 37:25.708
They'll be like, "Whoa!
What's that, rave boy?"

37:25.709 --> 37:26.976
And I get
"Glow-stick boy"

37:26.977 --> 37:29.345
all the time. That one's
another good one.

37:29.346 --> 37:30.813
<i>It's hard for me when
I go to work to get on</i>

37:30.814 --> 37:32.654
<i>the same level as
a lot of the other people</i>

37:32.655 --> 37:35.215
<i>because I'm not interested in
anything that they're interested.</i>

37:35.216 --> 37:37.920
Like, I don't care about bass fishing.
I don't.

37:37.921 --> 37:40.564
I want to go to EDC,
that's what I want to do.

38:02.679 --> 38:04.580
<i>A lot of people say,
"Oh, you're not</i>

38:04.581 --> 38:06.261
<i>"going to be raving
when you get older.</i>

38:06.262 --> 38:09.485
<i>"You're going to grow up and
you're gonna do adult things."</i>

38:09.486 --> 38:11.492
<i>I'm like, "No.
I don't think so."</i>

38:15.492 --> 38:20.630
I'm slowly falling into the
genre of rap and hip-hop.

38:21.732 --> 38:23.500
There's a guy named Logic.

38:24.801 --> 38:27.136
He just got
sponsored by Def Jam.

38:27.137 --> 38:29.939
You know what I think
of when I hear Def Jam?

38:29.940 --> 38:32.940
Run DMC.

38:34.454 --> 38:36.612
Great. Make me
look like a bad parent now,

38:36.613 --> 38:38.213
now that you don't
know who Run DMC is.

38:38.214 --> 38:38.981
Sorry.

38:38.982 --> 38:40.483
My parents are chill.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.484
Epic.

38:41.985 --> 38:43.521
Dope.

38:44.521 --> 38:45.656
I wouldn't say dope.

38:49.926 --> 38:52.495
<i>Alli took me to my first rave.</i>

38:52.496 --> 38:53.897
<i>This was back in the day</i>

38:53.898 --> 38:55.831
<i>where you had to call a
hotline and they tell you...</i>

38:55.832 --> 38:57.272
<i>It was underground,
very underground.</i>

38:57.273 --> 38:58.913
<i>They tell you where
to be the next day.</i>

38:58.914 --> 39:01.137
<i>There were no cell phones,
there was no Internet.</i>

39:01.138 --> 39:04.040
<i>The flyers were just the
only means of communication.</i>

39:05.208 --> 39:07.877
<i>Thanks for calling
Nocturnal Wonderland.</i>

39:07.878 --> 39:10.398
<i>We are really excited about you
being a part of this event.</i>

39:10.399 --> 39:13.883
<i>Directions will be posted tomorrow
afternoon on these voice mails.</i>

39:13.884 --> 39:16.152
<i>Come in peace or
don't come at all.</i>

39:16.153 --> 39:18.687
<i>You'd call,
you'd go to the map point,</i>

39:18.688 --> 39:20.793
get a map and then
go to the party.

39:22.788 --> 39:24.894
<i>You'd pride yourself
that it was illegal,</i>

39:24.895 --> 39:26.829
<i>you would pride yourself
it was underground.</i>

39:26.830 --> 39:28.798
<i>Not knowing if it
was going to get</i>

39:28.799 --> 39:30.968
broken up or not
was part of the fun.

39:31.605 --> 39:33.448
I think what
captured my imagination

39:33.449 --> 39:37.807
when I first started going out to
underground, illegal warehouse parties

39:37.808 --> 39:40.144
was just total chaos.

39:41.144 --> 39:42.878
Production was crap.

39:42.879 --> 39:45.781
Turntables would break.

39:45.782 --> 39:48.484
The lights were very limited
in what they could do.

39:48.485 --> 39:52.455
<i>Stages collapsing.
Crowd-control issues.</i>

39:52.456 --> 39:55.724
<i>I remember one time, I
walked down the wrong hall</i>

39:55.725 --> 39:57.673
<i>and I stumbled into
a</i> quinceanera <i>that</i>

39:58.027 --> 40:00.732
<i>was going on at the
same time as the rave.</i>

40:02.732 --> 40:04.600
<i>But you immediately got a sense</i>

40:04.601 --> 40:06.802
<i>that you had found
this secret world</i>

40:06.803 --> 40:10.676
<i>where everyone could come together
and be as one, essentially.</i>

40:12.676 --> 40:15.211
<i>There were cool parties
like Aphrodite's Temple.</i>

40:15.212 --> 40:17.480
- Paw Paw Ranch.
- Gilligan's Island.

40:17.481 --> 40:18.681
<i>Sheba's Erotic Banquet.</i>

40:18.682 --> 40:19.815
<i>Armageddon.</i>

40:19.816 --> 40:21.552
There were a million raves.

40:22.552 --> 40:25.488
It was all love.
It was cool.

40:25.489 --> 40:28.991
<i>But by early '93, it was done.</i>

40:28.992 --> 40:33.762
<i>No one was there for any other
reason than to get high.</i>

40:33.763 --> 40:37.098
<i>There was nothing left from the
original underground days.</i>

40:37.099 --> 40:38.734
The love was gone.

40:38.735 --> 40:42.941
<i>And I wanted that back.</i>

40:44.941 --> 40:46.711
<i>I started doing events.</i>

40:47.711 --> 40:49.078
<i>ED got bigger.</i>

40:49.079 --> 40:52.815
Twenty years of
slowly chipping away

40:52.816 --> 40:55.684
<i>and finally we're
getting somewhere.</i>

40:55.685 --> 40:58.554
<i>Pasquale really stuck
with it over time</i>

40:58.555 --> 41:01.790
and made it something
really important.

41:01.791 --> 41:04.260
<i>The music's gotten better, the
events have gotten better.</i>

41:04.261 --> 41:07.731
<i>The production
now is off the charts.</i>

41:10.600 --> 41:15.704
We are turning our subculture
into popular culture.

41:15.705 --> 41:19.073
And now it really is mainstream.

41:19.074 --> 41:22.745
But the sensibility of the music
is always about what's next.

41:22.746 --> 41:24.747
It's always pushing forward.

41:24.748 --> 41:26.949
<i>It's not limited in any way.</i>

41:26.950 --> 41:28.635
I mean, you can
sample and rework

41:29.018 --> 41:32.221
and rearrange any kind
of instrumentation.

41:32.222 --> 41:34.157
It could be country bluegrass.

41:47.604 --> 41:50.573
<i>To just watch the scene
grow is just mind-blowing.</i>

41:50.574 --> 41:53.112
It's just gotten to
this whole new place.

41:56.112 --> 41:59.218
<i>I never, ever thought it would
get to where it is right now.</i>

44:21.124 --> 44:22.792
<i>We've always listened to EDM.</i>

44:22.793 --> 44:25.473
<i>It's just one of those things
that kind of keeps my body alive.</i>

44:25.474 --> 44:28.097
<i>It keeps our energy up.</i>

44:28.098 --> 44:29.998
<i>When the beat drops
and 40,000 people</i>

44:29.999 --> 44:31.359
<i>are jumping at the same time,</i>

44:31.360 --> 44:32.863
<i>you feel that same energy.</i>

44:33.837 --> 44:35.805
<i>Everybody's connected.</i>

45:21.485 --> 45:23.925
<i>When you go somewhere and
something is beautiful</i>

45:23.926 --> 45:26.286
<i>or something wows you or
something is really unique,</i>

45:26.287 --> 45:28.524
<i>you leave everyday
problems in the past,</i>

45:28.525 --> 45:30.578
<i>even if it's for
a moment, it's awesome.</i>

45:33.396 --> 45:36.198
<i>We're spreading happiness,
we're spreading love.</i>

45:36.199 --> 45:39.201
<i>It's so gratifying.</i>

45:39.202 --> 45:42.175
<i>Not only for me,
but our entire team.</i>

45:52.215 --> 45:53.917
Hi, guys!

45:56.322 --> 45:58.954
Pasquale really wants to
spread the message of love

45:58.955 --> 46:00.255
throughout the party.

46:00.256 --> 46:02.491
And you guys are here
to do just that.

46:02.492 --> 46:05.093
<i>I'm responsible
for 500 performers</i>

46:05.094 --> 46:08.399
that are there specifically
to create an experience.

46:09.185 --> 46:11.133
You put better shows
on for each other

46:11.134 --> 46:12.934
than you do out there,
you know that, right?

46:12.935 --> 46:14.335
<i>Everyone that comes to our shows</i>

46:14.336 --> 46:16.371
is there more for the experience

46:16.372 --> 46:20.375
than for who's playing
a set somewhere.

46:20.376 --> 46:22.311
Hey, guys, focus on people

46:22.312 --> 46:24.078
who are not having a good time.

46:24.079 --> 46:25.314
That's right.

46:25.315 --> 46:28.183
That's our job, to make
people feel something.

46:28.184 --> 46:33.055
<i>We can tell a story through
stilt-walkers, ballerinas, clowns</i>

46:33.056 --> 46:36.592
<i>or mirror men that
jump on the trampolines.</i>

46:36.593 --> 46:38.861
<i>If you reach out
and touch somebody,</i>

46:38.862 --> 46:40.963
<i>and shake them
and go, "I'm here.</i>

46:40.964 --> 46:42.531
<i>"We're here together."</i>

46:42.532 --> 46:44.099
<i>They'll never forget that.</i>

46:50.540 --> 46:52.377
Wow!

46:54.377 --> 46:56.887
Oh, my gosh! Dude!

47:03.887 --> 47:05.588
<i>You got the music going on</i>

47:05.589 --> 47:06.823
<i>and then all the people and the
costumes and what they're doing.</i>

47:06.824 --> 47:10.069
<i>There's so much to take in.
It's really crazy.</i>

47:32.315 --> 47:35.417
<i>I really miss me
walking around myself.</i>

47:35.418 --> 47:37.252
<i>I can't really
walk around anymore.</i>

47:37.253 --> 47:39.922
Before I became famous,

47:39.923 --> 47:42.345
- I was also at these kind of festivals.
- Hey!

47:42.692 --> 47:45.060
Hey!

47:45.061 --> 47:49.000
Just walking around and,
discovering new stages, new DJs.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.158
I can only do that
from the backstage now.

49:22.090 --> 49:24.426
<i>I love to play
music for other people.</i>

49:24.427 --> 49:27.629
<i>When I'm onstage and you
see this massive crowd,</i>

49:27.630 --> 49:30.766
<i>it's so much
energy you get from it.</i>

49:30.767 --> 49:33.035
<i>And it's like I'm flying.</i>

49:33.036 --> 49:36.778
<i>It's one of the best feelings
you can have as a human being.</i>

49:41.778 --> 49:45.280
<i>I'm really
a socially anxious person.</i>

49:45.281 --> 49:47.215
<i>But I think being in
a big crowd of people,</i>

49:47.216 --> 49:49.317
<i>where everybody's
there for the music,</i>

49:49.318 --> 49:51.353
<i>where I don't really
have much to worry about,</i>

49:51.354 --> 49:53.881
<i>I've got the music to
soothe me and calm me down.</i>

50:02.498 --> 50:07.736
<i>You feel sound waves hitting
your body, you feel the bass.</i>

50:07.737 --> 50:09.652
<i>I love it.</i>

50:22.652 --> 50:24.094
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:32.094 --> 50:36.731
<i>I think you can never actually prepare
for what you can expect here.</i>

50:36.732 --> 50:40.102
The moment you walk onstage, you see
all those people in front of you,

50:40.103 --> 50:42.370
you forget about everything.

50:42.371 --> 50:44.406
<i>Everything I do tonight
is for the fans.</i>

50:44.407 --> 50:46.274
I'm here for them
and I'm going to

50:46.275 --> 50:48.144
give them the best
time possible.

51:21.978 --> 51:23.698
<i>A group of guys came up
to me and were like,</i>

51:23.699 --> 51:25.379
<i>"Yo, you want to go
up and crowd surf?"</i>

51:25.380 --> 51:28.569
<i>I was scared, I was nervous,
but you only live once.</i>

51:59.882 --> 52:03.251
<i>When I look down, I see
the smiles, I see tears,</i>

52:03.252 --> 52:06.731
<i>I see people screaming
and cheering me on.</i>

52:15.731 --> 52:18.636
<i>To be above the crowd,
I was on top of the world.</i>

52:28.678 --> 52:33.448
<i>I'll always be dancing to the
music and it's a great feeling.</i>

52:33.449 --> 52:37.786
To leave everything behind and
come to this perfect utopia,

52:37.787 --> 52:42.353
where it's just love, light,
purity and unity, and I love it.

53:27.637 --> 53:29.408
I'm going home, take a nap.

53:32.408 --> 53:34.342
<i>Tired, sleepy.</i>

53:34.343 --> 53:36.077
<i>Voice is gone.</i>

53:36.078 --> 53:40.953
<i>I need to sleep 'cause I got to
be back here tomorrow at 4:00.</i>

53:43.953 --> 53:46.291
<i>I have to get some real sleep.</i>

53:48.291 --> 53:50.358
My body aches.

53:50.359 --> 53:52.359
<i>I'm exhausted.
I'm starving.</i>

53:55.438 --> 53:56.965
<i>It's, like, I'm so exhausted,</i>

53:56.966 --> 53:59.370
<i>I don't even think
I can sleep anymore.</i>

54:01.201 --> 54:02.570
<i>Got to go catch a shuttle.</i>

54:02.571 --> 54:04.071
<i>So, we're peacing out,</i>

54:04.072 --> 54:07.023
<i>but thanks for the good times
and the great memories.</i>

54:55.023 --> 54:56.624
<i>Tonight, I'm getting married</i>

54:56.625 --> 54:58.783
<i>to my best friend
in the whole wide world.</i>

55:01.030 --> 55:04.701
It's going to be under the super
moon under the electric sky.

55:05.371 --> 55:07.635
It's probably one of
the most special nights

55:07.636 --> 55:09.606
that I'll ever have in my life.

55:10.606 --> 55:13.141
I mean, everything
is just lining up.

55:13.142 --> 55:15.090
It's gonna be awesome,
it's beautiful.

55:16.078 --> 55:19.481
My nerves are going crazy.

55:19.482 --> 55:22.817
I feel like so many weddings are
for other people or appearances

55:22.818 --> 55:25.620
or whatever, but you
two, it's like...

55:25.621 --> 55:27.188
<i>This is how you fell in love,</i>

55:27.189 --> 55:29.691
<i>and this is how you've stayed
in love through two kids.</i>

55:29.692 --> 55:32.060
<i>And a billion different changes</i>

55:32.061 --> 55:34.396
<i>and everything that's
happened in life.</i>

55:34.397 --> 55:36.698
<i>We've just seen too much
divorce in our lives,</i>

55:36.699 --> 55:38.967
<i>and we wanted to
make sure that it stuck.</i>

55:38.968 --> 55:41.669
<i>And I think 15 years
pretty much sums it up.</i>

55:41.670 --> 55:44.939
<i>EDC has always been something
that no matter what, like you...</i>

55:44.940 --> 55:46.908
<i>Go to happiness.</i>

55:46.909 --> 55:51.146
This is the ultimate
fantasy wedding, for sure.

55:51.147 --> 55:54.818
Got my pants here, got my
"PLUR" furry on the butt.

55:55.818 --> 55:57.455
Got my "EDC" on the side.

55:59.455 --> 56:02.958
You're like festive fabulous
without being raver newbie.

56:04.427 --> 56:06.594
Haven't been a raver
newbie since '98.

56:06.595 --> 56:08.701
- Oh, back in the day.
- Back in the day.

56:12.034 --> 56:14.669
Bounce check!

56:14.670 --> 56:18.106
<i>If you're gonna get married,
do it the way you wanna do it.</i>

56:18.107 --> 56:19.709
There's no other way to do it.

56:20.709 --> 56:22.210
Here we go.

56:22.211 --> 56:24.449
Going to see Matt
for the first time.

56:39.027 --> 56:40.642
Here we go!

57:01.784 --> 57:03.498
Wake up!

57:15.498 --> 57:16.551
Time to get married!

57:18.234 --> 57:21.035
<i>Today's the last day of EDC</i>

57:21.036 --> 57:23.040
<i>and, we all plan
on getting married.</i>

57:24.905 --> 57:27.642
I don't think that we wanna
get married individually,

57:27.643 --> 57:28.643
but as a family.

57:32.181 --> 57:35.650
<i>We're getting married on the
night of the super moon.</i>

57:35.651 --> 57:36.818
Outrageous.

57:36.819 --> 57:40.054
<i>The super moon
is just an added bonus.</i>

57:41.924 --> 57:43.063
<i>I'm super excited.</i>

57:49.063 --> 57:51.900
Every muscle in my body is sore.

57:51.901 --> 57:54.074
And, um, I'm ready
to do it again!

57:59.074 --> 58:01.576
EDC, day three.

58:01.577 --> 58:03.645
Guys, are you ready
to rock this parking lot?

58:03.646 --> 58:05.847
I can't wait. Me and Luan
are gonna go on the roof

58:05.848 --> 58:07.949
and just spin the whole
time before we go in,

58:07.950 --> 58:10.430
gets ourselves all pumped up.
We got all our favorite tracks.

58:10.431 --> 58:13.589
- We got all our equipment?
- Yeah, everything's in the back.

58:17.126 --> 58:19.561
<i>Tonight is our last
night celebrating.</i>

58:19.562 --> 58:21.122
<i>Kind of took over
the parking lot,</i>

58:21.123 --> 58:22.883
<i>set up a DJ booth,
speakers, mixing boards.</i>

58:22.884 --> 58:24.990
- Beautiful, like champs.
- There you go.

58:38.047 --> 58:41.316
<i>EDC is a chance for me to
get my music out there.</i>

58:41.317 --> 58:43.885
<i>Michael Ferris was the one
that always told me,</i>

58:43.886 --> 58:46.053
<i>"Yo, bro, start showing
people this. Screw it.</i>

58:46.054 --> 58:47.414
<i>"If that's what you want to do,</i>

58:47.415 --> 58:49.415
<i>"chase your dreams,
and if you fail, you fail."</i>

58:49.416 --> 58:54.197
<i>And so when I make it, I'll definitely
know it's gonna be 'cause of him.</i>

58:55.998 --> 58:58.299
<i>Now we're in Vegas,
we're doing this.</i>

58:58.300 --> 59:00.202
<i>We're gonna make it big one day.</i>

59:05.808 --> 59:07.976
Mikey!

59:07.977 --> 59:10.078
<i>Tonight we're gonna
try to get Ferris' jersey</i>

59:10.079 --> 59:12.747
<i>up as high as we can for the
whole crowd, everybody to see.</i>

59:12.748 --> 59:14.778
<i>I'm so pumped up right now.</i>

59:42.778 --> 59:44.245
<i>Happy day three.</i>

59:44.246 --> 59:46.351
Go hard tonight.
Last night, guys.

01:00:20.382 --> 01:00:22.917
<i>EDC is like a war of attrition.</i>

01:00:22.918 --> 01:00:25.286
It's who can stay
out the longest

01:00:25.287 --> 01:00:28.063
with minimal nutritional
intake and rest.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.731
EDC!

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:47.201
<i>It is, day three of
Electric Daisy Carnival.</i>

01:01:47.202 --> 01:01:49.771
<i>It's rough to keep
people safe for three days.</i>

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:52.073
Hi, sweetie.
You good?

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:54.245
- I'm just sleepy.
- Okay, no worries.

01:01:56.023 --> 01:01:58.813
<i>When it's hot, our medical
cases are through the roof,</i>

01:01:58.814 --> 01:02:00.548
<i>because people don't
drink enough water.</i>

01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:03.049
<i>Um, beer is not
a substitute for water.</i>

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:05.253
<i>And now you're
dancing all night,</i>

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:07.822
<i>which causes exhaustion
and dehydration.</i>

01:02:07.823 --> 01:02:09.891
My chest right
here hurts really bad.

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:12.052
Do you have any heart problems
or anything like that?

01:02:12.053 --> 01:02:15.530
No, no heart problems. No high
blood pressure. I do have anxiety.

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:17.965
<i>Um, I was having a lot
of trouble breathing,</i>

01:02:17.966 --> 01:02:19.567
<i>and by the third day,</i>

01:02:19.568 --> 01:02:21.235
<i>I felt like I couldn't
breathe at all.</i>

01:02:21.236 --> 01:02:23.237
<i>It felt like somebody
was sitting on my chest.</i>

01:02:23.238 --> 01:02:26.073
<i>And I was having an anxiety
attack, is what the problem was.</i>

01:02:26.074 --> 01:02:27.542
Well, I'm okay.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:29.944
Okay, so how did it all
start from the beginning?

01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:33.214
<i>I really try not to let the
anxiety bring me down at all.</i>

01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:36.184
<i>It's there sometimes, but I'm
learning how to handle it.</i>

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.665
They said they just wanted me to
calm down for a little while.

01:02:38.666 --> 01:02:39.454
Absolutely.

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:41.355
- Stay chilled out.
- Who's your favorite DJ?

01:02:41.356 --> 01:02:43.526
Above & Beyond,
they're playing tonight.

01:02:44.126 --> 01:02:46.829
They're gonna have to drag me
out of here on a stretcher

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.229
before I miss my favorite DJs.

01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:49.443
- Hey, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah!

01:02:49.444 --> 01:02:50.724
Don't say that, don't say that.

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.066
Take care of yourself, okay?

01:02:52.067 --> 01:02:54.383
- All right, no problem. Thanks.
- All right.

01:03:10.385 --> 01:03:11.385
<i>EDC Las Vegas!</i>

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:16.846
<i>If you know the words, I would
like you to sing along.</i>

01:05:02.564 --> 01:05:04.165
What's up, guys?

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.886
- How's it going?
- You guys doing great?

01:05:06.001 --> 01:05:07.436
Yes, sir.

01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:11.572
<i>With all the excitement
before our wedding,</i>

01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:13.708
<i>I have so many butterflies.</i>

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:15.251
<i>I'm just a hot mess.</i>

01:05:30.692 --> 01:05:31.692
- Hi!
- Hey!

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:37.331
<i>People always ask me, "Where do
you see yourself in 10 years?"</i>

01:05:37.332 --> 01:05:41.535
In all honesty, I hope I'm
exactly where I am right now,

01:05:41.536 --> 01:05:44.536
<i>because I don't want anything
more, what I have right now,</i>

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:46.107
it's awesome.

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:47.675
The rings you're
about to exchange

01:05:47.676 --> 01:05:49.443
are the symbols of
an unbroken circle.

01:05:49.444 --> 01:05:50.611
Please place the ring...

01:05:50.612 --> 01:05:51.612
There you go.

01:05:51.812 --> 01:05:53.781
With the power vested in me
and all of EDC,

01:05:53.782 --> 01:05:55.677
I now pronounce you
partners in life.

01:05:55.877 --> 01:05:57.578
You can seal it
however you want to.

01:05:57.579 --> 01:05:58.579
Go!

01:06:03.692 --> 01:06:05.626
<i>We've been
together for 15 years.</i>

01:06:05.627 --> 01:06:08.696
<i>So, we've been thinking
about this a lot.</i>

01:06:08.697 --> 01:06:12.466
<i>We wanted a real wedding, so I
asked my friend to get ordained,</i>

01:06:12.467 --> 01:06:14.046
<i>and, he was like,
"Okay, sure."</i>

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:18.105
<i>We've been doing
EDC since I met him.</i>

01:06:18.106 --> 01:06:22.286
<i>It's the perfect
tie-in for this moment.</i>

01:06:31.286 --> 01:06:33.187
<i>Looking at her
coming towards me,</i>

01:06:33.188 --> 01:06:35.268
<i>it's like the light at
the end of the tunnel.</i>

01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:37.585
<i>But the light is actually
coming towards you.</i>

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.737
<i>By the power vested in me
by the state of Nevada,</i>

01:06:49.738 --> 01:06:52.473
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

01:06:52.474 --> 01:06:54.342
You may kiss the bride.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:09.628
Whoo!

01:07:13.628 --> 01:07:17.731
<i>Happiness and relief
and joy all bundled into one.</i>

01:07:17.732 --> 01:07:18.833
<i>Unforgettable.</i>

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:20.068
<i>Yeah, exactly.</i>

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:22.227
<i>This is the only
word I can have for that.</i>

01:07:30.445 --> 01:07:33.647
<i>It was just an epic night.</i>

01:07:33.648 --> 01:07:36.484
<i>Just the peace with each
other, the unity, the respect.</i>

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:38.152
<i>- Love.
- The love.</i>

01:07:38.153 --> 01:07:39.694
<i>It all ties in.</i>

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:48.362
<i>Pretty soon
we have to say goodbye.</i>

01:07:48.363 --> 01:07:50.163
<i>And then fly away to
our respective places</i>

01:07:50.164 --> 01:07:52.399
<i>on the opposite
corners of the globe.</i>

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.979
<i>And then after EDC, we won't see
each other for at least four months.</i>

01:08:01.576 --> 01:08:04.145
<i>We're not gonna think
about drama tomorrow.</i>

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:06.147
<i>We're not gonna
talk about goodbyes,</i>

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:08.412
<i>'cause we want to enjoy
our last day at EDC.</i>

01:08:34.843 --> 01:08:37.822
<i>Here we are one last time
under the electric sky.</i>

01:08:47.822 --> 01:08:49.323
<i>It's been a long journey.</i>

01:08:49.323 --> 01:08:51.625
<i>Raving, having fun,
ups and downs.</i>

01:08:51.626 --> 01:08:54.595
We've been going pretty
crazy the past three days.

01:08:54.595 --> 01:08:56.596
<i>This is the finale,
the end all be all,</i>

01:08:56.598 --> 01:08:58.598
<i>and I plan on
going out with a bang.</i>

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.804
<i>To end my weekend here at EDC,</i>

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.573
<i>I'm going to have
my grandpa with me</i>

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:08.542
<i>to experience my favorite
DJs, Above & Beyond.</i>

01:09:08.542 --> 01:09:10.183
I think my grandpa
would be really proud

01:09:10.184 --> 01:09:10.812
of me being
right here right now.

01:09:11.011 --> 01:09:13.613
He was never into the corporate
stuff and was always like,

01:09:13.615 --> 01:09:15.549
"F the government,"
kind of thing.

01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:17.952
So, I'm sure he'd really
like an event like this.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.854
I'm really glad
I got to get him in.

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:31.044
It's not just about
the music, it's about

01:09:31.045 --> 01:09:33.901
the people coming
together to enjoy it.

01:09:33.902 --> 01:09:35.502
<i>Whatever we do with the show,</i>

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:38.505
<i>it should help people feel
more connected with the music.</i>

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:40.774
<i>It should bring people in.</i>

01:09:40.774 --> 01:09:42.354
Then the magic really happens.

01:10:53.581 --> 01:10:56.786
<i>We ended up making our way to
nearly the front of the crowd.</i>

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.353
<i>That jersey is gonna fly.</i>

01:10:59.354 --> 01:11:02.423
<i>We want the entire stadium to
remember the name Michael Ferris,</i>

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:05.003
<i>and that EDC knows that
he's here with us forever.</i>

01:11:23.745 --> 01:11:26.814
<i>We're holding up his
jersey, waving it around.</i>

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:28.384
<i>'Cause he's here with us.</i>

01:11:29.384 --> 01:11:31.500
<i>You can't convince me he's not.</i>

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.201
<i>We have fun onstage.</i>

01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:51.505
<i>We've been doing the push-the-button
thing at a lot of the shows.</i>

01:11:51.506 --> 01:11:52.986
Basically, at some
point in the set,

01:11:52.987 --> 01:11:54.708
we'll get someone up onstage

01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:57.644
to restart the records.
It's something very simple,

01:11:57.645 --> 01:12:00.148
but we wanna make
it really special.

01:12:29.644 --> 01:12:31.512
Hello, my darling.
What's your name?

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:32.649
- Sadie.
- Sadie.

01:12:34.649 --> 01:12:36.817
I have no idea what's
about to happen,

01:12:36.818 --> 01:12:39.187
but I have a feeling
it's gonna be a big deal.

01:13:51.526 --> 01:13:52.762
Right now?

01:15:07.068 --> 01:15:10.871
<i>I got to press the button for the
biggest crowd in the country</i>

01:15:10.872 --> 01:15:13.974
<i>at the biggest festival
in the country.</i>

01:15:13.975 --> 01:15:16.877
I have no words for it.
There's no words

01:15:16.878 --> 01:15:18.812
to describe what
I just got to do.

01:15:18.813 --> 01:15:21.148
I got to see things from
the DJs' point of view.

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:23.720
There's so many people.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:29.757
The is the coolest, most
awesomest moment of my life.

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:07.029
<i>It's been such
a positive experience.</i>

01:16:08.029 --> 01:16:11.231
<i>You can't lose that. That's
the whole point in it.</i>

01:16:11.232 --> 01:16:12.866
<i>It's supposed to be
an inspiration</i>

01:16:12.867 --> 01:16:14.507
<i>for you to take it
out everywhere else</i>

01:16:14.508 --> 01:16:16.210
<i>to everybody that you meet.</i>

01:16:30.918 --> 01:16:34.755
<i>When we held up that jersey,
I knew he was with us.</i>

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:37.693
<i>All I saw in my head was Ferris</i>

01:16:38.693 --> 01:16:41.060
cracking up like,
"You guys did it.

01:16:41.061 --> 01:16:42.429
"Hey, thank you so much."

01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.264
Thanking us.

01:16:44.265 --> 01:16:50.871
<i>I was so happy to show him the,
biggest and best party one last time.</i>

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.727
It was awesome.

01:17:12.618 --> 01:17:15.829
<i>Looking at what this is today
from what it was when it started</i>

01:17:16.029 --> 01:17:17.798
<i>blows me away.</i>

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.067
<i>Those experiences from
those underground events,</i>

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:23.704
<i>bringing people together, breaking
boundaries, it's still happening.</i>

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:25.072
The spirit's there,

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:27.954
<i>and this year it was
on another level for us.</i>

01:17:39.954 --> 01:17:42.533
<i>I hope people out there
that never experience EDC,</i>

01:17:42.818 --> 01:17:45.292
<i>I hope they don't have
a misconception about it.</i>

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:48.395
<i>The culture behind it, of
being one, of being a family,</i>

01:17:48.396 --> 01:17:50.163
<i>if people can just
treat each other</i>

01:17:50.164 --> 01:17:51.804
<i>like people treated
each other at EDC,</i>

01:17:51.805 --> 01:17:54.011
this world would be
a lot better place.

01:17:58.005 --> 01:17:59.637
<i>I get more love in these events</i>

01:17:59.837 --> 01:18:01.775
<i>than I do out
in the streets, honestly.</i>

01:18:01.776 --> 01:18:02.976
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

01:18:02.977 --> 01:18:04.911
<i>It's a place where I call home.</i>

01:18:04.912 --> 01:18:06.472
<i>And if you wanna
feel welcome, you wanna</i>

01:18:06.514 --> 01:18:08.567
<i>feel loved and accepted
for who you are,</i>

01:18:09.015 --> 01:18:11.485
<i>this is the place to be.</i>

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:15.489
<i>This has absolutely been the greatest
experience of my whole life.</i>

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.791
<i>If I start getting stressed
out, I can just remember</i>

01:18:17.792 --> 01:18:20.293
<i>how many people
was I with at this event</i>

01:18:20.294 --> 01:18:22.896
<i>who are also going
through so much,</i>

01:18:22.897 --> 01:18:25.165
<i>and we all were
able to just let go.</i>

01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:29.010
<i>I can just calm myself down, take
a deep breath and move forward.</i>

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.970
<i>In more ways than one,
it's going to feel like</i>

01:18:37.971 --> 01:18:40.147
<i>I'm really putting on
a costume over there.</i>

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:42.115
<i>And I know that sounds
a little bit silly,</i>

01:18:42.116 --> 01:18:45.050
<i>'cause it's the costume that
I have to wear every day.</i>

01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:47.856
<i>A suit, a straight face.</i>

01:18:48.856 --> 01:18:50.646
Not looking forward
to it too much.

01:18:55.463 --> 01:18:57.463
<i>It's been the best
weekend of our life.</i>

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:26.296
<i>I feel depleted.</i>

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:32.099
Um, lack of food, lack of sleep.

01:19:33.601 --> 01:19:37.309
The partying that we really
did, dancing nonstop.

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:42.876
I can't wait to get home.

01:19:42.877 --> 01:19:44.581
I can't wait to get in my bed.

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:50.283
<i>The things we saw,
the things we did...</i>

01:19:50.284 --> 01:19:53.253
My aunt is going to kill me.

01:19:53.254 --> 01:19:55.518
I am so scared to bring
this RV back to her.

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:05.265
All right. So we gotta go
all the way back there.

01:20:05.266 --> 01:20:07.868
His gravesite's right
under that rainbow.

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:09.135
Right there.

01:20:09.136 --> 01:20:10.926
That really is
exactly where it is.

01:20:18.078 --> 01:20:22.282
<i>Ferris was so adamant about
enjoy the moment while you can.</i>

01:20:22.283 --> 01:20:25.452
<i>Enrich your life as much as possible
while you can, when you can.</i>

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.243
<i>You never know
what's gonna happen.</i>

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:32.294
<i>Oh, man, I accept
that he's gone.</i>

01:20:33.294 --> 01:20:37.163
Sad, but at the same
time it's like

01:20:37.164 --> 01:20:39.164
<i>he's with us everywhere we go.</i>

01:20:45.439 --> 01:20:46.641
It's okay, big guy.

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:50.911
<i>When we huddled up right over...</i>

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:52.179
Wolfpack lives on.

01:20:54.348 --> 01:20:57.450
It felt like we were
back together again.

01:20:57.451 --> 01:21:00.587
Wolfpack chant, bro. Wolfpack
chant on three, straight up.

01:21:00.588 --> 01:21:01.688
Three, two, one.

01:21:01.689 --> 01:21:03.323
- Wolfpack!
- Chant!

01:21:03.324 --> 01:21:04.624
Whoo!

01:21:04.625 --> 01:21:07.494
This week is forever
gonna be in our heads

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:11.331
as the craziest,
best trip of our lives.

01:21:11.332 --> 01:21:14.439
<i>We all came together
to heal each other.</i>

01:21:18.439 --> 01:21:20.206
<i>100% worth it,</i>

01:21:20.207 --> 01:21:22.576
every sacrifice each and
every one of us made.

01:21:23.444 --> 01:21:27.280
