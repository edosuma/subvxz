WEBVTT

00:11.054 --> 00:12.664
Gaunt still has friends
among us.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.753
Sir, might I have
a moment of your time?

00:14.884 --> 00:17.495
Whoever comes to you,
that's your traitor.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.932
-Ah!

00:20.063 --> 00:21.499
Take Lord Harwood away
and confine him to his quarters.

00:21.630 --> 00:22.761
I can explain.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.415
You, Colonel Salt?

00:24.546 --> 00:25.503
In charge
of the whole damn country?

00:25.634 --> 00:26.461
It seems strange to me, too,

00:26.591 --> 00:27.766
but there we are.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.638
What you do is so important.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.944
It's rather thrilling, actually.
Being part of it all.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.381
Salt planned it all along.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.383
And while he's ruling
in my name as my deputy,

00:35.513 --> 00:37.602
then no one dare touch him.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.996
We need him alive and well for
now, smiling for the newsreels.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.606
Nobody need know
he's your prisoner.

00:41.737 --> 00:44.435
And if we were forced
to use Stormcloud,

00:44.566 --> 00:46.698
it would be done
in Harwood's name.

00:46.829 --> 00:47.743
I shall
create a diversion.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.310
-One!
-Do not fire!

00:49.440 --> 00:50.528
-Two! <i>
-And you two leave by the back.</i>

00:50.659 --> 00:52.052
-Three! Onward!
-No!

00:57.057 --> 00:59.885
<i>Well, your president thinks
ending wars quickly is good.</i>

01:00.016 --> 01:02.671
You sons of bitches want them
to use Stormcloud?

01:02.801 --> 01:05.717
Martha, you have to get
out of here right now.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.719
-What are you talking about?
-Stormcloud.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.591
They are going
to use it on London.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.680
Just to be clear,
I'm not going anywhere.

01:11.810 --> 01:12.681
Martha, you have to go.
What about...

01:12.811 --> 01:14.335
N-No. Come on, Patricia.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.511
You haven't told him that you're
pregnant?

01:16.641 --> 01:18.730
<i>Don't blame you.
He will freak the fuck out.</i>

01:18.861 --> 01:20.428
You can't just go around
hurting people

01:20.558 --> 01:22.212
when you feel like it.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.824
All right. I promise.

01:25.955 --> 01:26.956
Gully's dangerous.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.262
Mad as a hatter.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.396
-Gully doesn't know anything.
-Someone knows.

01:32.527 --> 01:33.528
Is there something you're
not telling me, Alfie?

01:33.658 --> 01:34.616
No.

01:34.746 --> 01:35.573
Tell me.

01:35.704 --> 01:36.792
I fucked him.

01:40.622 --> 01:41.449
I'm not safe anywhere.

01:41.579 --> 01:42.885
<i>He'll kill me.</i>

01:43.015 --> 01:44.582
And he'll kill you, too.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.410
You better come to America
with me, then.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.934
I'm leaving, Sandra.
I'm going to America.

01:49.065 --> 01:51.023
You mean without me.

01:51.154 --> 01:53.852
How many people
have died to get us there?

01:53.983 --> 01:55.376
I can't go.

01:55.506 --> 01:56.681
What changed your mind
so suddenly?

01:56.812 --> 01:58.509
This is my home.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.728
If that's
not worth fighting for,

01:59.858 --> 02:01.121
then what is worth fighting for?

02:22.751 --> 02:24.666
How are we looking?

02:25.928 --> 02:28.496
Well, if it's an ambush,
it's a bloody good one.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.889
No spot for a sniper.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.848
Not that I can see, anyway.

02:32.978 --> 02:35.372
Which means you won't,
either, if there is one.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.157
That would simplify matters.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.290
Thank you, by the way.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.813
What for?

02:41.944 --> 02:43.946
Being here. Staying.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.991
It's very good of you.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.689
God knows I'd leave if I could.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.908
God knows I tried.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.259
Why did you stay?

02:52.389 --> 02:54.609
Stupidity.

02:54.739 --> 02:58.961
So not honor, loyalty,
hatred of tyranny?

03:01.442 --> 03:04.271
Nah.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.839
You won't confess to
any finer feelings, will you?

03:07.970 --> 03:10.015
-Or maybe I just like a fight.

03:19.286 --> 03:22.550
If things go lemony,
hit the deck and stay there.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.813
Will do.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.079
Lord James Harwood,

03:30.210 --> 03:32.864
<i>16th Earl of Dunboyne,
leader of the Raven Union,</i>

03:32.995 --> 03:35.606
<i>high chancellor
of Union-held England,</i>

03:35.737 --> 03:38.435
<i>has passed away following
a severe heart attack.</i>

03:38.566 --> 03:41.046
<i>Details will follow on the hour.</i>

03:41.177 --> 03:41.917
Poor chap.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.572
Good riddance.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.835
Stresses of war, I expect.

03:46.965 --> 03:49.229
Hoisted by his own guitar.

03:51.143 --> 03:52.449
Would you stop staring
out the window, please?

03:52.580 --> 03:53.711
It's making me nervous.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.365
Sorry.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.589
You're really scared,
aren't you?

04:01.719 --> 04:04.418
Who, me? No. Just alert.

04:05.723 --> 04:09.292
Your friend Alfie
has no morals and no sense.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.512
I'll strangle him myself if
Troy doesn't do him in first.

04:13.688 --> 04:14.645
Only joking.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.995
Fair play.

04:17.126 --> 04:21.870
But you can't deny that Melanie
was a gallus wee bird.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.959
It's hard to resist
a smasher like that.

04:26.527 --> 04:27.658
Men.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.487
What's wrong with you?

04:30.618 --> 04:32.272
That's a big question, Mrs. P.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.939
Sir John. My congratulations.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.115
Your fortunes have risen
since we last met.

04:50.246 --> 04:51.726
As have yours, Prime Minister.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.989
I've been hearing
many good things.

04:54.119 --> 04:57.645
Mr. Pennyworth. A surprise
and a pleasure to see you again.

04:57.775 --> 05:00.169
And in such exalted company.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.433
If your father could
see you now, he'd be very proud.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.521
Sir.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.436
General Thursday.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.046
-Inspector.
-Hmm.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.571
Interesting spot you chose.

05:10.701 --> 05:13.617
-Not one for the history books.
-New beginnings.

05:13.748 --> 05:16.011
Lord Harwood had a taste
for the theatrical.

05:16.141 --> 05:19.623
Plain, simple honesty.
That's us.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.103
My condolences
for your great loss.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.714
Lord Harwood
was an outstanding leader.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.195
Larger than life.
Irreplaceable.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.936
Everybody can be replaced.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.546
Forgive me if I'm surprised

05:29.677 --> 05:31.679
that he's been replaced
by you, Sir John.

05:31.809 --> 05:35.030
Not as surprised as I am.
I'm not worthy, of course.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.599
But if you think we're
discouraged, think again, sir.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.254
Our cause is larger
than any one man.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.213
Lord Harwood
led the Raven Union,

05:44.344 --> 05:47.172
but he did not command the Army.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.740
It's the Army
who've beaten you in battle.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.047
-Not Lord Harwood.
True.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.745
You don't need the Raven Union
at all, really, do you?

05:54.876 --> 05:57.008
On the contrary.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.184
We need them to deal
with clever chaps like you.

05:59.315 --> 06:02.362
The Army takes no part
in politics or government.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.886
-Warfare is our only trade.
Indeed.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.802
That's why I'm rather surprised
you approved Stormcloud.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.020
That's a purely
Raven project, no?

06:09.151 --> 06:11.719
We're glad you know
about Stormcloud.

06:11.849 --> 06:14.896
You understand the seriousness
of your predicament.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.855
The Army had
very little hand in it.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.683
Or am I wrong?

06:19.814 --> 06:23.121
Would the Army really let
a political party use

06:23.252 --> 06:25.863
such a weapon on its own people?

06:25.994 --> 06:30.128
All Raven Union military assets,
including Stormcloud,

06:30.259 --> 06:32.914
are under Army Council command.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.743
Isn't that so, Sir John?

06:35.873 --> 06:39.877
Mm. That is exactly so.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.489
The Army and the Union
are brothers, united.

06:42.619 --> 06:46.623
Lord Harwood's sad demise has
only brought us closer together.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.886
But it has also given us pause.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.541
This war has gone on
long enough.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.197
We'd like to sit down and talk.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.547
See if we can find
an honorable peace.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.942
We're always happy to talk.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.988
Compromise and reconciliation
are desperately needed.

07:04.119 --> 07:06.034
I could not agree more.

07:06.164 --> 07:09.254
Compromise and reconciliation.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.169
As to time and
location, we leave that to you.

07:11.300 --> 07:16.131
But I have a suggestion,
if I may, And a favor to ask.

07:16.261 --> 07:19.917
We'd like to bury Lord Harwood
in his family crypt in London.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.050
It would be a gesture
of good faith on both sides

07:22.180 --> 07:24.008
if you'd allow his funeral party
to enter the city.

07:24.139 --> 07:27.272
We could hold talks
after the ceremony.

07:27.403 --> 07:30.275
In the spirit of new beginnings.

07:30.406 --> 07:33.278
I must consult with Her Majesty
the Queen first, of course,

07:33.409 --> 07:36.978
but, uh, I'm sure
she'll be happy to oblige.

07:43.854 --> 07:46.901
-Here's to Lord Harwood.
Lord Harwood.

07:47.031 --> 07:49.425
-May he rest in peace.
-Mm. May he rot in hell.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.601
Whichever is deemed appropriate
by the powers that be.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.124
Hmm.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.952
Well, I hate
to be a wet blanket,

07:55.083 --> 07:56.737
but I'm not so sure that
Harwood's death is a good thing.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.826
I agree.

07:58.956 --> 08:01.959
Wow. Really? I am--I am
deeply touched. Thank you.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.527
Seriously, what do we know
about this Salt character?

08:04.658 --> 08:07.965
Well, he's clever enough.
But he has no power base.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.141
And there's clear tension
between him and Thursday.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.882
-They're wobbling.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.449
Politically vulnerable.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.364
Why else would they ask
for peace talks?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.453
They still have Stormcloud.

08:17.584 --> 08:20.151
Yes, but would they dare use it?
That's the question.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.719
A madman like Harwood might
do anything, but these are...

08:22.850 --> 08:24.286
ordinary half-decent sort of men.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.114
They'll be mindful
of the world's opinion.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.508
Fearful of consequences.

08:28.638 --> 08:32.512
-What did you think, Alfie?
-I was looking for snipers.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.252
But you must have got
a general sense.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.167
Did they seem trustworthy?

08:36.298 --> 08:37.995
I don't trust anyone.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.612
-You fucking bastard!
-Hello.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.396
The fuck are you sneaking in
like that for?

10:14.526 --> 10:16.441
-You're plastered.
-That I am.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.095
You're supposed to be
looking after Mum.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.271
I can do two things at once.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.882
It's fucking irresponsible.
Where is she?

10:22.012 --> 10:23.623
She's having a snooze. Hey!

10:23.753 --> 10:26.451
And it's not me that's
irresponsible. It's you.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.803
Was it me that fucked the wife
of a stone-cold killer?

10:29.933 --> 10:31.152
-No.
-Yeah, right. Fair play.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.110
-But still. It's me mum.
-Was it me

10:33.241 --> 10:34.634
that squandered America? No.

10:34.764 --> 10:37.245
Was it me that fucked away
our travel money?

10:37.375 --> 10:39.421
-No.
-All right, all right.

10:39.551 --> 10:43.338
I could be in California
with a whore on my face.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.992
There's a nice picture.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.384
Sorry, Mrs. P.
I thought you were snoozing.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.038
I was till you started yelling.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.866
Your son's got the gall

10:49.997 --> 10:52.347
to be angry with me
for drinking on duty.

10:52.477 --> 10:56.394
Duty? Protecting me from
the fruits of your adultery.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.222
Poor man's entitled to be drunk.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.485
He could be
in California with...

11:00.616 --> 11:02.357
with all his hopes and dreams.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.620
You wanted to stay.
I did what you wanted.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.100
-I did what's right.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.667
You did this, you did that.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.538
Never a thought for how
anyone else might feel.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.149
-Ah. That's right.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.413
A married woman. The shame.

11:15.544 --> 11:19.287
If your father was alive,
he'd be rolling in his grave.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.029
I'm to be murdered in my bed
by an angry cuckold

11:22.159 --> 11:25.162
or else gassed by a terror bomb.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.686
And you only went
and told her about Stormcloud.

11:26.816 --> 11:29.297
-Thanks very much.
-Well, you're welcome.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.168
It's called honesty.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.431
-I don't like to scare you.
-Do I look scared?

11:33.562 --> 11:36.217
As it happens, I was at a very
high-level secret meeting today.

11:36.347 --> 11:41.135
Ooh. Oh, see him, Mary.
Fancy Dan.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.398
Now that loony old
Lord Harwood's dead,

11:43.528 --> 11:45.530
the Union
want to hold peace talks.

11:45.661 --> 11:48.272
The war will be over soon.
There will be no terror bombs.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.535
"Secret meetings" he says.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.365
Who's to know anymore whether
he's honest or he's lying?

11:54.496 --> 11:58.152
So sad but true, Mrs. P.
So sad but true.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.719
If you two are gonna
gang up on me,

11:59.849 --> 12:01.633
then I'm off.
You can look after yourselves.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.288
Not likely.
Where would you go?

12:04.419 --> 12:05.855
He's got nobody else.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.378
Sandra won't take him.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.554
Look, Mum,
you're not going to be murdered

12:09.685 --> 12:11.600
in your bed or anywhere else.
I promise.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.428
I'll sort things out with Gully.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.996
We'll talk.
He's a reasonable man at heart.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.519
-Don't worry.
-I stopped worrying

12:17.649 --> 12:19.129
when your father died.

12:19.260 --> 12:22.045
When death comes, I'll be ready.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.264
Now I'm off to work.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.265
-Hmm.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.267
-Goodbye.
-Yeah.

12:26.397 --> 12:29.009
Shall I come to the hospital
with you, Mrs. P, eh?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.272
-Just to be safe.
-No, you won't.

12:31.402 --> 12:32.969
Did you not hear
what I just said?

12:33.100 --> 12:34.362
That you're ready to die?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.061
There's ham in the larder
if you want any.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.633
Gully?

12:44.764 --> 12:47.462
-A reasonable man at heart?

12:47.592 --> 12:50.247
-I don't want her worrying.

12:50.378 --> 12:54.861
I'll have to go and find him.
Sort this out.

12:54.991 --> 12:58.038
I can't let it go on like this,
just waiting for him to show up.

12:58.168 --> 13:01.998
Oh, well, don't you be
going it alone.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.784
You'll need me for backup.

13:04.914 --> 13:08.439
You know very well
I have to go it alone. Alone.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.572
Don't you try following me.
You hear me?

13:10.702 --> 13:12.792
I hear you.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.665
Are these peace talks real
at least?

13:16.796 --> 13:20.234
Oh, they're real.
But they're a Union trick.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.584
Not sure what sort,
but they're a trick.

13:22.714 --> 13:25.152
That Salt's a lairy
little creature.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.502
The meeting went well,
I hope, sir.

13:27.632 --> 13:28.938
Very well. Very well.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.550
Call the crown undertaker
and have him start making

13:32.681 --> 13:34.291
arrangements for
His Lordship's funeral.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.163
Yes, sir. Of course.

13:36.293 --> 13:39.296
But... surely no one will come
if it's in North London.

13:39.427 --> 13:40.645
The League's territory.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.430
No, of course not.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.259
But that's not the point.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.138
Mm.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.535
Mm!

14:00.665 --> 14:02.972
Oh, hold on there, stud.

14:05.105 --> 14:08.499
Slow up. Slow up.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.763
-We need to talk. Mm.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.157
-No, we don't.
-Yes. Yes, we do.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.419
About what?

14:15.550 --> 14:19.641
Um, the-the birds and the bees.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.730
Ah. Right. Well, no problem.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.688
I've got a condom in my wallet.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.473
You keep a condom
in your wallet?

14:25.603 --> 14:27.475
Why didn't you use one before?

14:27.605 --> 14:29.520
Mm, slipped my mind, I guess.

14:29.651 --> 14:33.394
-Heat of the moment.
-Oh, um, that's funny.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.744
Here we go again with the funny.
Are we gonna have sex or comedy?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.398
If it's the latter,
I'll keep my clothes on.

14:37.528 --> 14:40.401
Uh, sex.
We'll... we'll have sex.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.187
But you won't need your condom.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.494
Mm, why's that?

14:47.974 --> 14:50.541
Because you didn't use it last
time and I'm already pregnant.

14:55.720 --> 14:56.678
You're not joking.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.462
Nope.

14:58.593 --> 15:01.596
But it's kind of funny
though, right?

15:01.726 --> 15:04.686
We have sex a few times
and I get knocked up.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.383
Oh, it's a laugh riot.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.429
Why the hell didn't you
tell me before now?

15:08.559 --> 15:10.692
I don't know. I was--I was
waiting for the right moment.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.390
Wh...

15:13.521 --> 15:15.305
You knew about this when you
refused to evacuate

15:15.436 --> 15:17.133
and you didn't tell me.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.526
That wasn't the right moment?

15:18.656 --> 15:20.180
Uh, well, I knew
you'd try to make me leave.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.746
Because you're having a baby.

15:21.877 --> 15:23.574
Which means I need to do
whatever you tell me?

15:23.705 --> 15:25.576
It means you leave
a fucking war zone.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.839
I thought about the situation
very carefully,

15:27.970 --> 15:30.799
and I decided to stay because
the risks are worth taking.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.193
-I can make a difference here.
-It's a war.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.585
What are you,
an attack helicopter?

15:34.716 --> 15:36.239
I can make a difference.

15:41.244 --> 15:42.550
Okay.

15:44.378 --> 15:45.553
I'm-I'm...

15:45.683 --> 15:48.077
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

15:50.645 --> 15:54.475
This is--It's a surprise,
that's all. It's...

15:56.433 --> 15:57.521
It's a good surprise.

15:59.871 --> 16:02.657
And if I--if I remember right,
you're, uh, you're what?

16:02.787 --> 16:06.748
You're-you're, um,
you're about six weeks along?

16:06.878 --> 16:08.228
Yeah.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.231
Your sister says it's a boy,

16:11.361 --> 16:13.581
and she's always right,
apparently.

16:13.711 --> 16:14.625
-Oh, that's true.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.977
Um...

16:19.369 --> 16:21.458
M-May I?

16:21.589 --> 16:23.156
It's your baby, too.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.426
-Wow.
-Right?

16:38.606 --> 16:41.522
I will go see about
a marriage license tomorrow.

16:41.652 --> 16:44.612
-Uh, what?
-A marriage license.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.222
Can't get married without one.

16:46.353 --> 16:47.528
Who said we're getting married?

16:47.658 --> 16:49.573
-Hmm?
-You didn't ask me.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.575
Maybe I don't want
to get married.

16:51.706 --> 16:52.620
Oh, don't be obtuse.
We have to get married.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.665
No, we don't.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.276
You'd sooner raise a bastard
than get married to me?

16:56.406 --> 16:57.973
-Really?
-It's a close call.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.889
No child of mine is gonna
be illegitimate, so I'm sorry,

17:01.020 --> 17:02.891
I'm gonna have to insist
that we do the right thing,

17:03.022 --> 17:05.198
however repulsive you find me.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.202
You "insist"
that we get married?

17:09.332 --> 17:11.160
-I do.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.467
Well...

17:13.597 --> 17:17.862
I insist that you kiss
my pregnant ass.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.560
Where are you going?

17:19.690 --> 17:21.910
-Leaving.
-This is your apartment.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.391
-Well, I need some air.
-Then I'll come with you.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.567
No. The hell you will.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.181
Oh, my God.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.143
Oh, my.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.854
Four, three, two, one.

18:46.908 --> 18:49.476
Who's the blonde piece?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.782
Must be his tart, eh?

18:51.913 --> 18:53.697
Slutty-looking thing.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.139
Good morning to you all.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.317
<i>Good morning, England.</i>

19:06.667 --> 19:09.278
<i>A noble life has ended.</i>

19:10.801 --> 19:13.674
As all life must end.
Too soon.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.461
Too soon to see
his great works finished.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.773
<i>I want to take this opportunity
to assure my fellow citizens</i>

19:25.903 --> 19:27.905
<i>that the country
is in safe hands.</i>

19:28.036 --> 19:30.081
<i>The Raven Union High Council
and the Army General Staff</i>

19:30.212 --> 19:33.563
<i>are working hand in glove
to continue the legacy</i>

19:33.694 --> 19:36.479
<i>of leadership bequeathed to us
by this great man.</i>

19:38.960 --> 19:41.180
His life's done.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.488
But the fire he lit
still burns, eh?

19:48.317 --> 19:50.754
Let's us all resolve
to build that flame

19:50.885 --> 19:52.452
into a roaring furnace.

19:54.845 --> 19:59.154
Let's us all resolve to complete
the noble work he began

19:59.285 --> 20:01.722
and make this green
and pleasant land

20:01.852 --> 20:03.854
once again
a beacon to the world!

20:08.772 --> 20:10.339
Forgive my tears.

20:12.776 --> 20:15.736
My heart's in that coffin
with Lord Harwood.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.479
I'm a humble man
from simple stock.

20:19.609 --> 20:22.351
What strength I have,
this man gave me.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.832
The last thing he said to me

20:24.962 --> 20:26.616
before his mighty
heart gave out...

20:28.662 --> 20:30.229
"Do your duty, son."

20:33.536 --> 20:37.279
"Do your duty," he said.

20:39.368 --> 20:42.937
With all my heart and soul,
I intend to obey that order!

20:44.852 --> 20:46.941
And in his name,

20:47.071 --> 20:51.032
in England's name...

20:51.162 --> 20:52.642
I ask the same of you!

20:58.735 --> 21:01.260
Let's all of us do our duty, eh?

21:06.177 --> 21:07.788
God bless.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.924
Yes, sir.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.771
And... out.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.339
And what a grand day
it has been.

21:37.470 --> 21:40.342
<i>Starting with a magnificent
funeral procession</i>

21:40.473 --> 21:42.649
<i>through the rightful streets
of London, Lord Harwood...</i>

21:42.779 --> 21:45.739
Where's Alfie, I wonder?

21:45.869 --> 21:48.568
Aye, you've a magic touch
with a brew, Mrs. P.

21:48.698 --> 21:51.962
It's, uh, strong but subtle,
you know?

21:52.093 --> 21:54.051
I said, where's Alfie?

21:54.182 --> 21:56.097
Sorry. I thought that was a--

21:56.227 --> 21:57.881
what's that?--
a rhetorical question.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.927
It wasn't.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.711
Where is he?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.062
He's maybe went to see Gully.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.936
He said he might, eh?

22:09.066 --> 22:11.068
Alone?

22:11.199 --> 22:13.680
Why didn't you go with him?

22:13.810 --> 22:15.812
He said he had to go alone.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.640
And you're not worried?

22:19.816 --> 22:21.862
Eh...

22:21.992 --> 22:23.907
...taken too soon.

22:24.038 --> 22:28.042
<i>But I think we can all agree
the country is in good hands.</i>

22:44.754 --> 22:46.582
...laid to rest today

22:46.713 --> 22:49.759
<i>in his family crypt in London.</i>

22:49.890 --> 22:52.371
<i>May he rest in peace.</i>

22:53.894 --> 22:57.593
<i>Flags throughout England
will be flown at half-mast</i>

22:57.724 --> 23:00.379
<i>throughout next week's mourning period.</i>

23:02.119 --> 23:05.079
<i>Coming up,
a three-minute silence</i>

23:05.209 --> 23:07.821
<i>to commemorate Lord Harwood.</i>

23:07.951 --> 23:09.605
<i>After which,
we'll be looking at some</i>

23:09.736 --> 23:11.607
<i>of his greatest moments,</i>

23:11.738 --> 23:14.958
<i>remembering our noble leader.</i>

23:23.140 --> 23:25.012
Harwood's funeral.

23:27.231 --> 23:29.408
Gave him a good send-off.

23:31.148 --> 23:33.194
Nine lives that one.

23:33.324 --> 23:36.458
I see our friend Salt's
doing rather well for himself.

23:36.589 --> 23:39.809
And to think we took him
for catering corps.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.811
Fooled us good and proper.

23:41.942 --> 23:44.118
Mm.

23:44.248 --> 23:45.728
Oh, well.

23:48.035 --> 23:50.080
You, uh, you took your time.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.214
I thought you'd come after me.

23:53.344 --> 23:55.172
Oh, no, I...

23:55.303 --> 23:57.174
I-I always knew
you'd do the right thing

23:57.305 --> 24:00.961
and come to me eventually.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.311
I don't like to waste energy.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.445
Looks like you've wasted
some energy at least.

24:07.837 --> 24:10.144
Spared the telly though.
Nice one.

24:19.893 --> 24:22.591
So...

24:22.722 --> 24:23.766
my friend...

24:26.552 --> 24:29.816
what have you got
to say for yourself?

24:29.946 --> 24:30.991
What is there to say?

24:32.383 --> 24:34.037
Then why are you here?

24:34.168 --> 24:36.300
I owe you a fair crack at me,
that's all.

24:36.431 --> 24:40.043
Oh. Baring your throat
for the blade, huh?

24:41.741 --> 24:43.830
You can call it that.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.007
Mm. No, not you, Alfie.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.139
No, you-you have no death wish.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.100
You think you can take me.

24:53.230 --> 24:57.104
You actually think
you can take me.

24:59.149 --> 25:00.629
How do you want to do this then?

25:01.804 --> 25:04.459
You might want to start
by dropping that gun.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.315
I'm not the pheasant plucker.
I'm the pheasant plucker's son,

25:34.445 --> 25:36.143
and I'm only plucking pheasants
till the pheasant plucker comes.

25:36.273 --> 25:37.492
Overture and beginners,

25:37.623 --> 25:40.364
-Miss DuFrench.
-Hairy hungry hellhounds

25:40.495 --> 25:43.237
hold Hohner harmonicas
in high esteem.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.239
-Fuck off, Fred. I heard you.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.939
I'm sure I have seen her
on the telly.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.637
Have you been
on the telly, love?

25:51.767 --> 25:52.812
Who are you?

25:52.942 --> 25:54.378
She asked if you've been
on telly.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.467
Yes, I have, but who are you?

25:56.598 --> 25:58.992
-In what?
-All sorts of things.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.908
Many. Who are you?

26:02.038 --> 26:03.387
Well, I'm Peg.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.128
This is my sister Bet.

26:05.259 --> 26:07.348
Don't mind us prying, Vikki.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.872
Have you got a boyfriend?

26:10.003 --> 26:12.309
Now, look here...

26:12.440 --> 26:14.137
She asked if you
got a boyfriend.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.618
Simple question. Yes or no?

26:16.749 --> 26:20.230
And be honest, or I'll tear out
your fucking tongue.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.191
-Yes.
Thank you, Vikki.

26:24.321 --> 26:27.237
Now, what's his name?

26:28.848 --> 26:30.240
-John.
-John what?

26:31.981 --> 26:33.026
Salt.

27:12.108 --> 27:15.024
We're so happy to sit down
with you at last.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.984
-Thank you for coming to us.
-Least we could do, ma'am.

27:18.114 --> 27:21.509
Um, we have here a brief summary
of our position, uh,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.903
suggestions for territorial
partition and so forth.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.035
If you'd like
to start from there.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.953
This looks
like a list of demands.

27:31.084 --> 27:34.783
No. Not demands.
Um, points for negotiation.

27:34.914 --> 27:37.220
Oh, dear.

27:37.351 --> 27:40.528
I think we have
a misunderstanding.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.791
This is not a negotiation.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.924
These are peace talks.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.753
That's what we agreed to,
isn't it? Peace talks?

27:47.883 --> 27:49.450
Indeed.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.757
I don't quite see
the difference.

27:51.887 --> 27:56.022
Negotiations happen when both
sides have something to offer.

27:56.152 --> 27:59.199
Peace talks happen when
one side has their foot

27:59.329 --> 28:01.201
on the other's throat.

28:01.331 --> 28:03.333
We invited you here
in good faith.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.509
What remains of League forces
and both of you personally

28:05.640 --> 28:07.816
must surrender unconditionally.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.298
If you fail to do so,

28:11.428 --> 28:14.997
we will deploy
a Stormcloud device over London.

28:15.128 --> 28:17.304
I believe you've seen
how Stormcloud works.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.484
General,

28:23.614 --> 28:26.356
you'd do such a thing
to your own people?

28:26.487 --> 28:29.490
Just as many will die if we have
to fight our way into London.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.579
Stormcloud is a humane
and sensible alternative

28:31.710 --> 28:33.668
that we won't hesitate
to use if necessary.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.540
Surely the Raven Union Council
won't sanction...

28:36.671 --> 28:38.325
The council will do what I say!

28:42.808 --> 28:45.288
You have 48 hours
to think this over.

28:46.463 --> 28:48.465
We give you so long only
because General Thursday

28:48.596 --> 28:51.730
is a compassionate
and persuasive man.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.002
Excuse me, madam.

29:35.556 --> 29:36.949
Two against one?

29:37.079 --> 29:38.559
Oh, Monty's here to help

29:38.689 --> 29:41.344
just in case
you decide to run off.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.432
Come on,
you know me better than that.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.391
I thought I did, Alfie.

29:44.521 --> 29:47.307
I thought I did
and then you fucked my wife.

29:47.437 --> 29:50.223
-Fair play.
-A man's wife, Alfie.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.529
That's sacred.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.444
I raised you better than that.

29:54.575 --> 29:56.359
You didn't raise me.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.448
You were my CO for a while.
That's all.

29:58.579 --> 30:00.320
Yes. Yes, well, of course.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.191
I'm-I'm not your father, but...

30:02.322 --> 30:04.237
but I'd wager you a pretty penny

30:04.367 --> 30:06.935
that he'd be as ashamed of you
as I am now.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.632
A man of honor like him.

30:08.763 --> 30:10.417
You fucking leave my father
out of this.

30:10.547 --> 30:14.203
Oh-ho-ho. There he is.
Yes. There's my boy. Good.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.945
I was starting to worry
that you'd left all your fire

30:17.076 --> 30:18.773
behind you in the colonies.

30:18.904 --> 30:22.385
Now, I'm gonna
have to even the odds.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.474
-Oh!

30:24.605 --> 30:25.606
Fuck's sake!

30:27.303 --> 30:29.088
Well...

30:29.218 --> 30:31.046
My own Melanie
stabbed me, and...

30:31.177 --> 30:33.483
now we're both hurting.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.834
It's invigorating, no? Huh?

30:35.964 --> 30:38.140
You know,
get the animal spirits flowing.

30:38.271 --> 30:40.882
No. Just hurts.

30:41.013 --> 30:44.364
You were never one for
the poetry of it all, were you?

30:44.494 --> 30:45.974
-Monty.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.327
Ah.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.115
Oh, come on.

30:56.245 --> 30:58.334
Can't we talk this through?

30:58.465 --> 31:00.119
Do I really need to die?

31:00.249 --> 31:02.251
Wouldn't a good kicking
be enough?

31:02.382 --> 31:06.516
Run, or I'm gonna put a bullet
through your head right now.

31:06.647 --> 31:10.390
It'll all be very dull
and squalid.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.045
Yeah.
That does sound unpleasant.

31:14.307 --> 31:17.701
I'm sorry about this, Gully.
I really am.

31:17.832 --> 31:21.531
I'm gonna give you
five minutes head start.

31:21.662 --> 31:24.883
Now, go on. Run along.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.151
Fuck's sake.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.388
Help. Help.

31:52.519 --> 31:53.520
What are you doing?

31:53.650 --> 31:54.782
Fuck off!

31:54.913 --> 31:56.088
Mind your own business!

31:59.830 --> 32:02.355
You, out.

32:02.485 --> 32:03.878
Who's this?

32:04.009 --> 32:07.186
Don't you recognize her?
She's famous.

32:07.316 --> 32:08.491
I'm going.

32:10.189 --> 32:12.191
Coming through!

32:12.321 --> 32:14.236
Been on telly,
haven't you, Vikki?

32:14.367 --> 32:16.673
Please help me, miss.
These women are mad.

32:16.804 --> 32:18.762
-Shh.
-Hey!

32:18.893 --> 32:20.851
Don't do that.

32:20.982 --> 32:23.463
It's all right, pet.
She's got it coming.

32:23.593 --> 32:27.597
This is John Salt's fancy woman.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.425
-So?
-So we'll see how her fella

32:29.556 --> 32:31.645
likes having a loved one
torn from his bosom.

32:31.775 --> 32:33.299
No, you won't.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.605
I will. I'm gonna send him
her head in a cake tin.

32:35.736 --> 32:36.737
No, you're bloody not!

32:36.867 --> 32:38.521
Here we go.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.349
I'll put kettle on.

32:41.872 --> 32:43.700
Bet, you promised me.

32:43.831 --> 32:46.138
You promised. No more violence.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.357
I did, but this is different.

32:48.488 --> 32:51.534
Lord Harwood was my friend.

32:51.665 --> 32:54.537
He was good to me,
and I'll not betray him.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.452
This is rightful revenge.

32:56.583 --> 32:57.758
There's no such thing.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.629
Don't be daft.
'Course there is.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.327
You weren't so fussy

33:01.457 --> 33:03.677
when I brained
pervy old Sutcliffe, were you?

33:03.807 --> 33:05.766
Happy to see some revenge then,
weren't you?

33:05.896 --> 33:09.291
Look, I can't defend Salt.
He's a fascist pig.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.511
But surely there are
other ways to punish him.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.382
This woman's done nothing
to anyone.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.602
Nothing. I've done nothing.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.604
You sat on the wrong cock, love.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.258
Bad luck.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.695
It's like getting run over
by a bus.

33:22.870 --> 33:26.395
If you hurt this woman,
I am leaving you.

33:26.526 --> 33:29.355
Give over.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.139
Don't be like that.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.446
Seriously. I'm-I'm done.

33:33.576 --> 33:34.795
We're done.

33:34.925 --> 33:36.666
Done?

33:36.797 --> 33:39.147
You're not done.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.673
We're an item, you and me.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.371
You can't leave.

33:45.501 --> 33:48.287
I can, and I will.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.724
You promised me, Bet.
You promised.

33:50.854 --> 33:53.466
Well, then, all made up, are we?

33:53.596 --> 33:55.163
Lovebirds again?

33:56.512 --> 33:58.732
Look...

33:58.862 --> 34:01.082
maybe we've been a bit hasty.

34:02.692 --> 34:05.826
Maybe we're not being fair
to Vikki.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.784
There's other ways to get Salt,
don't you think?

34:07.915 --> 34:09.569
Oh, don't ask me.

34:09.699 --> 34:11.223
This is your bed
you've to lie in.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.834
As fucking usual.

34:13.964 --> 34:16.097
No need for that tone.

34:17.403 --> 34:19.274
When you two rolled up here,
I said to you,

34:19.405 --> 34:20.623
she's mad as a hatter, didn't I?

34:20.754 --> 34:22.973
And that was the truth.

34:23.104 --> 34:24.932
And I said to you,
you never learn.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.761
You never learn that
something's not right, up here.

34:27.891 --> 34:30.242
You can't have relationships
like other folk.

34:30.372 --> 34:31.721
Always ends in tears.

34:31.852 --> 34:33.419
You shouldn't talk to her
like that.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.899
Oh, I'm allowed, Katie,
because I look after her.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.685
Have done my whole life,
my whole bloody life.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.469
I'm allowed.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.689
And I'm allowed
to change my mind.

34:42.819 --> 34:44.952
No violence.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.520
Not to this one, any road.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.087
Thank you.

34:49.217 --> 34:50.610
Salt's getting it,
whether you like it or not.

34:50.740 --> 34:52.394
Hmm, lovely.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.918
And what the heck are we
gonna do with Vikki, then?

34:55.049 --> 34:57.269
I mean, we can't exactly
let her go, can we?

34:57.399 --> 34:58.705
Why not?

34:58.835 --> 35:01.882
I promise, I swear,

35:02.012 --> 35:04.754
I won't tell a soul
about any of this.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.539
Why's that, then?

35:06.669 --> 35:09.542
Why would you
be quiet about this?

35:09.672 --> 35:11.935
I just... would.

35:13.589 --> 35:14.764
Oh.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.431
What, you think this
is funny, do you?

36:12.561 --> 36:14.128
Not much happens
in the afterlife,

36:14.259 --> 36:16.435
so we have to amuse ourselves
as best we can.

36:16.565 --> 36:18.524
Well, I'm glad
I can be of service.

36:18.654 --> 36:21.004
Any suggestions here?
You like giving advice.

36:21.135 --> 36:23.703
But you don't like taking
advice, so why would I bother?

36:23.833 --> 36:25.531
I'm desperate here, Baz.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.794
Okay. Advice.

36:27.924 --> 36:30.753
You have to look at
yourself honestly, Alfred.

36:30.884 --> 36:33.060
Why do you keep finding yourself
in these foolish predicaments?

36:33.191 --> 36:34.844
What's the darkness inside

36:34.975 --> 36:37.543
that drives you toward
self-destruction?

36:37.673 --> 36:39.893
Oh, for fuck's sake, Baz, I need
to know how to stay alive.

36:40.023 --> 36:43.157
Oh. I have no idea.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.333
It's not looking good though,
is it?

36:45.464 --> 36:48.510
That is a nasty wound.

36:48.641 --> 36:50.860
You'll probably bleed out
in a couple of hours.

36:50.991 --> 36:53.646
My opinion,
about the bigger picture?

36:53.776 --> 36:56.388
You're torn between
a love of order

36:56.518 --> 36:58.477
and a lust for transgression.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.653
You think you're fighting
for yourself,

37:00.783 --> 37:02.829
but you're really
fighting with yourself.

37:05.092 --> 37:07.616
Used to be Spanish who'd come
have these little chats with me.

37:09.270 --> 37:10.793
Annoyed the shit out of me,
but he was

37:10.924 --> 37:13.100
fucking brilliant company
compared to you.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.712
How can you be your own man
when you don't know who you are?

37:16.843 --> 37:18.758
If you
got nothing useful to say,

37:18.888 --> 37:20.325
then on your bike.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.631
Be still. Be calm.

37:22.762 --> 37:25.721
Running makes your heart
beat harder.

37:25.852 --> 37:28.420
You lose blood faster
and you get weak quicker.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.073
Oh, really?

37:30.204 --> 37:32.293
I had no idea.

37:32.424 --> 37:36.732
Next time I see you,
I hope you're in a better mood.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.647
No, wait.

37:40.736 --> 37:41.911
Oh, fuck you.

37:46.002 --> 37:48.918
Alfie! Alfie!

37:49.049 --> 37:51.617
-Alfie!

37:51.747 --> 37:53.967
-Alfie.

37:54.097 --> 37:56.926
I know you're close...

37:57.057 --> 37:58.972
'cause I can smell you.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.889
Doesn't get much better
than this, does it?

38:03.019 --> 38:04.456
Huh?

38:05.283 --> 38:09.417
Just me, you and the woods.

38:13.639 --> 38:17.295
I'm coming, Alfie! I'm coming!

38:28.262 --> 38:30.699
All right, Rita.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.962
Now, what the fuck happened
in here?

38:33.093 --> 38:34.137
Maid's day off.

38:34.268 --> 38:35.704
Who's this old bag?

38:35.835 --> 38:38.707
-This is Alfie's mum.
-Mum?

38:38.838 --> 38:41.710
Well, listen, Alfie's...

38:41.841 --> 38:44.452
Mrs. Pennyworth to you!

38:46.933 --> 38:48.804
Where are they?

38:50.197 --> 38:51.764
Epping Forest.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.854
Thank you.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.014
All right, Gully.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.583
Very good.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.151
I'd have been
terribly disappointed

39:31.281 --> 39:33.719
if you'd let me sneak up on you.

39:33.849 --> 39:35.155
You took long enough.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.505
Mm. Disgracefully slow.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.028
I must be getting old.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.118
Anyway, here we are.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.774
Just so you know...

39:47.385 --> 39:49.387
it wasn't Melanie's fault.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.782
-I pushed myself on her.
-Oh.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.871
A gentleman to the end, eh?

39:57.307 --> 39:59.266
Nonsense, of course.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.400
Melanie's a whore,
and she wanted to hurt me.

40:02.530 --> 40:05.925
-You were hurting her.
-That's what she wanted.

40:06.055 --> 40:07.753
Not sure she did, actually.

40:07.883 --> 40:09.755
Aw. Well, I...

40:09.885 --> 40:12.671
I think you'd be surprised.

40:12.801 --> 40:15.413
I'm very glad you got her
on that plane.

40:15.543 --> 40:18.677
'Cause killing a woman is--it's
a sign of weakness, isn't it?

40:18.807 --> 40:21.723
An admission of-- of failure.

40:21.854 --> 40:24.900
And then killing a man
on the other hand, well...

40:26.859 --> 40:28.991
There's a hundred
good reasons to kill a man.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.823
You led me astray, Gully.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.698
I thought
you were a bloody hero.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.180
Turns out
you're just bloody mad.

40:44.311 --> 40:47.880
Oh, such... such vim,
such courage.

40:48.010 --> 40:50.839
You know,
Melanie used to needle me

40:50.970 --> 40:53.363
that I was in love with you.

40:53.494 --> 40:56.715
And she did needle me,
because it's true.

40:58.194 --> 41:01.459
I do love you...
in my own way.

41:25.700 --> 41:26.875
Ah!

41:30.966 --> 41:33.491
Oh, God!

41:40.585 --> 41:43.065
-What's so funny?

41:43.196 --> 41:44.980
I believe...

41:45.111 --> 41:46.765
I believe I taught you
how to make this trap.

41:48.506 --> 41:52.161
You did. The Sumatran Whip.

41:52.292 --> 41:54.903
What's even funnier

41:55.034 --> 41:58.167
is that I killed the man
who taught me.

41:58.298 --> 42:01.214
He was a Dayak headhunter.

42:01.344 --> 42:03.999
He was a kindly old chap.

42:04.130 --> 42:06.741
Had seven wives, you know?

42:06.872 --> 42:08.395
And a throne of skulls.

42:10.484 --> 42:11.964
Takes all sorts.

42:12.094 --> 42:13.182
Yeah.

42:18.448 --> 42:20.189
Alfie?

42:22.061 --> 42:23.932
Aren't you going to kill me?!

42:27.066 --> 42:29.024
Nah.

42:29.155 --> 42:31.549
I'm grateful to you, Gully.

42:33.507 --> 42:36.379
I'd forgotten how much
I enjoy all this.

42:36.510 --> 42:39.034
I feel very alive.

42:41.123 --> 42:43.212
So thank you.

He lost.

Oh!

44:41.635 --> 44:43.855
Monty, what the fuck?

44:43.985 --> 44:46.161
Orders.

45:10.185 --> 45:11.926
Oh...

45:15.364 --> 45:16.714
Oh, fuck.

45:27.028 --> 45:29.204
Don't you start.

45:29.335 --> 45:31.990
Wasn't going to say a word.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.905
Come all the way
from the afterlife

45:34.035 --> 45:36.298
with nothing to say? Ha.

45:36.429 --> 45:37.517
I doubt it.

45:37.647 --> 45:39.301
I'm not here to talk.

45:39.432 --> 45:41.913
I'm here to guide you over,
if necessary.

45:43.131 --> 45:44.480
Fuck off.

45:44.611 --> 45:46.352
You're not guiding me anywhere.

45:46.482 --> 45:48.876
Not my call.

45:49.007 --> 45:51.052
Not looking good, is it?

45:51.183 --> 45:52.619
No, I'm staying.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.316
I got things I want to do.

45:54.447 --> 45:55.535
Such as what?

45:55.665 --> 45:57.276
Just out of interest.

45:57.406 --> 46:01.149
I want to, well...

46:01.280 --> 46:03.412
I want to make a difference.

46:03.543 --> 46:06.285
A difference? To what?

46:06.415 --> 46:10.463
No. It's embarrassing.

46:10.593 --> 46:13.509
You can tell me anything.
I'm dead.

46:16.382 --> 46:18.297
My dad was right.

46:20.908 --> 46:24.782
You have to serve something
or someone.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.264
And I want to make this a happy,
peaceful country again.

46:30.744 --> 46:32.180
Don't fucking laugh.

46:33.529 --> 46:35.488
I think I can help.

46:35.618 --> 46:37.490
That's a noble plan.

46:37.620 --> 46:40.319
Good luck with that.

46:40.449 --> 46:42.234
Thank you for your support.

46:44.540 --> 46:48.240
Also, what's so funny
about peace and happiness?

46:59.555 --> 47:01.949
Alfie.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.559
Oh, my Lord.

47:03.690 --> 47:05.431
Don't worry, Mum.

47:05.561 --> 47:07.346
It's just a scratch.

47:07.476 --> 47:09.000
-Look at you.
I know.

47:09.130 --> 47:10.349
Another good suit ruined, eh?

47:12.481 --> 47:14.005
Hey, Gully's in the woods.

47:14.135 --> 47:15.093
He needs an ambulance.

47:15.223 --> 47:16.355
Does he?

47:16.485 --> 47:17.660
I mean, really, does he?

47:17.791 --> 47:19.532
-Yeah.
-Right. Up.

47:19.662 --> 47:21.055
-Yeah, he does.
-All right.

47:21.186 --> 47:22.230
One, two, three...

47:22.361 --> 47:23.666
-Up! Got him.

47:23.797 --> 47:25.059
Come on, big boy. I've got you.

47:25.190 --> 47:26.278
-There you go.
-Oh, Alfie.

47:26.408 --> 47:27.540
Looks worse than it is.

47:27.670 --> 47:28.497
I'll be running about
in no time.

47:28.628 --> 47:29.629
Like buggery.

47:29.759 --> 47:31.109
-This puts a stop

47:31.239 --> 47:33.589
to all your shenanigans,
good and proper.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.548
Nothing for you
but bed rest from now on.

47:35.678 --> 47:37.680
-And porridge.

48:05.708 --> 48:09.321
Brothers and sisters...

48:09.451 --> 48:12.019
I am here to ask humbly
for your blessing.

48:13.847 --> 48:16.197
I ask you to ratify my status

48:16.328 --> 48:18.896
as pro tem high chancellor
of the kingdom.

48:20.636 --> 48:23.901
We've suffered a terrible loss.

48:24.031 --> 48:27.556
And I've only been
in this job a short while,

48:27.687 --> 48:31.691
but hopefully I've shown
that I'm fit for purpose.

48:31.821 --> 48:34.781
I've won the support
of our allies in the Army.

48:34.912 --> 48:38.263
I've rallied the rank and file.

48:38.393 --> 48:42.136
I've brought a devastating
new weapon onto the battlefield.

48:43.311 --> 48:46.097
Our enemies will soon
be forced to surrender.

48:47.489 --> 48:48.926
Very soon.

48:51.276 --> 48:54.801
I stand proudly on that record

48:54.932 --> 48:57.456
and humbly ask for your votes.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.459
Thank you.

49:02.722 --> 49:06.421
Each council member will speak
in ascending order of rank.

49:07.509 --> 49:09.250
I say yes.

49:10.512 --> 49:11.774
Yes.

49:11.905 --> 49:13.733
-Yes.
-Yes.

49:13.863 --> 49:15.648
Yes.

49:15.778 --> 49:17.389
-Yes.
-Yes.

49:17.519 --> 49:19.130
-Yes!

49:19.260 --> 49:21.132
-Yes.
-Yes.

49:22.481 --> 49:24.309
I say yes.

49:24.439 --> 49:26.137
The motion is carried.

49:28.182 --> 49:30.837
God save England!

49:30.968 --> 49:33.535
God save England!
