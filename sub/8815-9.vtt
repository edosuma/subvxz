08:48.219 --> 08:49.385
Yeah.
Thank you.

08:54.525 --> 08:56.292
Hey, you're the head counselor, right?

08:56.360 --> 08:57.660
Uh, yeah.

08:57.728 --> 08:59.062
Um, Eric Doyle.

08:59.130 --> 09:00.263
Any idea who might've done this?

09:00.331 --> 09:01.231
No.

09:01.298 --> 09:03.066
I mean, everyone liked Lenny.

09:03.134 --> 09:05.101
He was a good boss.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.836
So, he had no enemies whatsoever, no?

09:06.904 --> 09:10.373
Especially any who wear clerical collars?

09:10.441 --> 09:12.408
- So you know about the priest.
- Oh, yes.

09:12.476 --> 09:14.310
Yeah, that guy's always coming around here

09:14.378 --> 09:15.745
and getting into arguments with Lenny.

09:15.813 --> 09:17.113
Hmm.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.516
But he's a priest.

09:19.583 --> 09:20.783
Right.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.553
Mr. Doyle, where were you between
11:30 and 12:00 this morning?

09:25.089 --> 09:26.489
Uh... here.

09:26.557 --> 09:29.392
In counseling sessions
with, uh, Nikki and Connor.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.460
Connor?

09:30.528 --> 09:33.730
Well, that's the altar boy
from the priest's photo.

09:33.797 --> 09:35.198
So, is it, is it true

09:35.266 --> 09:36.599
Mr. Arietta's dead?

09:36.667 --> 09:38.868
Well, duh, dumb-ass.

09:38.936 --> 09:41.137
It is. Yeah.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.438
Did you know him well?

09:42.506 --> 09:43.339
A little, I guess.

09:43.407 --> 09:44.807
He, he, I mean, he ran the place.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.077
Do you know if Mr. Arietta was
involved in any drug activity?

09:48.145 --> 09:49.546
(laughing): Drugs?

09:49.613 --> 09:50.780
I mean, I wish he was.

09:50.848 --> 09:52.182
That would've made him more interesting.

09:52.249 --> 09:53.950
(chuckles) Okay.

09:54.018 --> 09:55.251
Enough about the dead guy.

09:55.319 --> 09:57.720
Tell me everything you know
about Padre Pederast.

09:57.788 --> 09:58.922
Who?

09:58.989 --> 10:00.156
Father Frank.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.357
Did you see him do this?

10:01.425 --> 10:03.159
Do you think he's capable?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.595
Father Frank kill Mr. Arietta?

10:05.663 --> 10:06.663
Yes.

10:06.730 --> 10:08.031
No. No way.

10:08.098 --> 10:09.399
NIKKI: What do you mean "no way"?

10:09.466 --> 10:11.067
The guy's a creeper and
totally obsessed with you.

10:11.135 --> 10:12.669
He's just overprotective.

10:13.871 --> 10:15.138
Ever since my parents died,

10:15.206 --> 10:17.941
he feels like he's got to watch
out for me or something.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.375
But he's a good guy.

10:19.443 --> 10:21.010
He's just a little...

10:21.078 --> 10:23.046
just a little annoying.

10:23.113 --> 10:24.013
- See?
- Hmm?

10:24.081 --> 10:25.014
Annoying.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.182
Mm-hmm.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.750
When was the last time you saw him?

10:27.818 --> 10:29.586
Uh, he... Here this morning.

10:29.653 --> 10:32.021
Yeah, preacher seemed pretty pissed.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.089
Oh.

10:33.157 --> 10:34.357
Uh, wait, you don't really think

10:34.425 --> 10:35.892
that, like, Father Frank did this, right?

10:35.960 --> 10:37.427
- 100%.
- Thank you.

10:37.494 --> 10:39.862
You've been very helpful.

10:39.930 --> 10:40.863
Right.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.699
See? Told you.

10:42.766 --> 10:45.902
No, I hate to admit it, but
you might be on to something.

10:45.970 --> 10:46.869
Sorry, what was that?

10:46.937 --> 10:48.204
You might be on to something.

10:52.309 --> 10:53.876
That's him.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.678
Frank Lawrence.

10:55.746 --> 10:57.847
The most evil of people
have the most normal names,

10:57.915 --> 10:59.415
I've experienced.

10:59.483 --> 11:01.150
Beware anyone named Keith.

11:03.854 --> 11:06.256
Well, his criminal
record's pretty extensive.

11:06.323 --> 11:08.157
Assault and battery, disorderly conduct,

11:08.225 --> 11:09.892
- drug charges.
- See?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.160
Not very priest-like.

11:11.228 --> 11:13.263
But nothing in the past ten years.

11:13.330 --> 11:18.835
Ah, restraining order filed
by Lenny Arietta last week.

11:18.902 --> 11:21.004
LUCIFER: Ah, well,
it's funny how Padre Punchy

11:21.071 --> 11:22.272
failed to mention a restraining order.

11:22.339 --> 11:23.706
Please tell me now we have enough

11:23.774 --> 11:25.008
to bring this priest down.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.276
We have enough to bring him in.

11:26.343 --> 11:27.677
You ready to go to church?

11:27.745 --> 11:29.946
Bringing down a priest is
the only reason I ever would.

11:30.014 --> 11:31.481
<i>In.</i> Bring him <i>in.</i>

11:31.548 --> 11:33.116
Yes, bring him <i>in</i> so we can bring him down.

11:33.183 --> 11:34.284
(chuckles)

11:35.085 --> 11:37.020
Hey, um, you go ahead.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.788
I'll... I'll meet you downstairs.

11:38.856 --> 11:41.324
- (elevator bell dings)
- Just something I got to do first.

11:50.901 --> 11:53.036
Hey, so I'm in the middle of something,

11:53.103 --> 11:54.570
but I haven't seen you all week.

11:54.638 --> 11:56.205
Are we gonna talk about what happened?

11:58.709 --> 12:00.810
What?

12:00.878 --> 12:02.278
Our kiss, Dan.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.980
It's kind of a big deal.

12:04.048 --> 12:05.581
DAN: Right, I'm sorry, Chloe.

12:05.649 --> 12:06.983
I've had a lot on my mind.

12:07.051 --> 12:08.951
Yeah. You okay?

12:09.019 --> 12:09.952
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.988
But we should talk.

12:12.056 --> 12:13.456
About everything.

12:13.524 --> 12:14.724
Just not here.

12:14.792 --> 12:17.093
Okay, do you want to do dinner
at my place, get takeout?

12:17.161 --> 12:19.329
Yeah. Zhang Chow's?

12:19.396 --> 12:21.831
(chuckles) Zhang Chow...
I was just gonna say that.

12:21.899 --> 12:22.932
- (chuckles)
- Yeah, all right.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.467
Sounds good.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.469
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

12:35.446 --> 12:37.380
Oh, how's it going, buddy?

12:37.448 --> 12:41.017
Malcolm, what are you doing here?

12:45.122 --> 12:47.056
Oh, you didn't hear the good news?

12:47.124 --> 12:49.325
Back on duty. (sniffs)

12:49.393 --> 12:50.793
So soon after, um...?

12:50.861 --> 12:53.062
What, my partner's suicide?

12:53.130 --> 12:55.164
(exhales)

12:55.232 --> 12:57.700
Yeah, can't let that keep
me down, am I right?

12:57.768 --> 12:58.801
But don't worry.

12:58.869 --> 13:00.236
I already got a new partner.

13:00.304 --> 13:02.905
Yeah, convinced the higher-ups
to give me my first choice.

13:02.973 --> 13:04.374
You.

13:05.609 --> 13:07.377
Oh, my God.

13:07.444 --> 13:10.646
Seriously, Dan, you got to try this.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.018
What's your game, Malcolm?

13:16.086 --> 13:18.388
Partners? Are you kidding me?

13:18.455 --> 13:21.391
Oh, well, what better way to
keep an eye on you, am I right?

13:21.458 --> 13:22.658
I saw you talking to Decker.

13:22.726 --> 13:24.093
You want to tell her, don't you?

13:26.530 --> 13:28.664
What, that I'm the one who shot you?

13:28.732 --> 13:29.632
Why would I do that?

13:29.700 --> 13:31.667
Your conscience.

13:31.735 --> 13:33.269
I know you, Danny Boy.

13:33.337 --> 13:35.438
You forget, this ain't the
first time we've been partners.

13:35.506 --> 13:37.173
I looked the other way a few times.

13:37.241 --> 13:38.975
- That didn't make us partners.
- Sure, it did.

13:39.042 --> 13:40.810
Yeah, and it ate away at you

13:40.878 --> 13:42.578
until you finally had enough at Palmetto.

13:42.646 --> 13:43.980
DAN: <i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

13:44.047 --> 13:45.314
MALCOLM: <i>No, I-I understand.</i>
<i>No, I get it, I get it.</i>

13:45.382 --> 13:47.083
No, you were just protecting
that wife of yours.

13:47.151 --> 13:48.584
<i>She saw me, I went for my gun.</i>

13:48.652 --> 13:51.090
<i>Boom. No, you took me out</i>
<i>before I could take her out.</i>

13:51.121 --> 13:52.955
No, no hard feelings.

13:53.023 --> 13:54.490
I understand.

13:54.558 --> 13:59.195
But... the minute you want to come clean,

13:59.263 --> 14:02.899
you and I... we both go to jail.

14:02.966 --> 14:04.700
Hmm?

14:04.768 --> 14:08.171
I mean, you... you really want
to throw away your marriage?

14:08.238 --> 14:11.140
Watch little Trixie grow
up from behind bars?

14:11.208 --> 14:12.408
Think this through, Dan.

14:12.476 --> 14:16.145
With you gone, uh, who's
gonna protect Chloe?

14:16.213 --> 14:19.048
What do you want from me, Malcolm?

14:19.116 --> 14:20.583
Nothing much.

14:20.651 --> 14:24.053
You're gonna go into evidence
and borrow something for me.

14:24.121 --> 14:26.088

Well, I don't know why you're

if you wanted to be faithful,

Mr. Morningstar, surprised to see you again.

17:43.649 --> 17:45.850
Oh, I wouldn't miss this for the world.

17:45.918 --> 17:48.152
Father Frank, when was the
last time you saw Lenny Arietta?

17:48.220 --> 17:49.587
This morning.

17:49.592 --> 17:50.892
Despite the restraining order.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.394
I answer to a higher authority.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.029
Not today you don't.

17:54.621 --> 17:55.988
What happened when you saw him?

17:56.055 --> 17:57.556
We exchanged words.

17:57.624 --> 17:59.391
Things got a little heated.

17:59.459 --> 18:00.559
What were you fighting about?

18:00.627 --> 18:02.694
That altar boy of his, of course.

18:02.762 --> 18:04.696
Why were you fighting over Connor?

18:04.764 --> 18:06.899
Because I'm worried that
Arietta's gonna pull Connor

18:06.966 --> 18:08.133
into his drug ring.

18:08.201 --> 18:09.434
So, what, you give him a right hook?

18:10.370 --> 18:12.437
Sadly, I did.

18:12.505 --> 18:14.373
- And then what?
- And then I left.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.508

you skipped a part, didn't you?

18:16.576 --> 18:18.744
You know, the part where
you beat him to death

18:18.811 --> 18:19.745
with a baseball bat?

18:19.812 --> 18:22.281
He's dead?

18:22.348 --> 18:24.716
Oh, Heavenly Father.

18:24.784 --> 18:26.118
Oh, come on.

18:26.186 --> 18:27.619
How gullible do you think we are?

18:27.687 --> 18:31.990
I had troubles with the man,
but he didn't deserve to die.

18:32.058 --> 18:33.692
And I certainly didn't kill him.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.160
Can you account for your whereabouts

18:35.228 --> 18:37.062
between 11:30 and 12:00 this morning?

18:37.130 --> 18:39.331
Uh, I was here.

18:39.399 --> 18:40.866
Taking confessions.

18:40.934 --> 18:43.468
Mrs. Madison had a lot to say,
took up the whole hour.

18:43.536 --> 18:46.738
By chance, does Mrs. Madison
have a limo driver?

18:46.806 --> 18:48.941
She does.

18:49.008 --> 18:50.275
Damn.

18:50.343 --> 18:52.477
Just spoke to his alibi.

18:52.545 --> 18:53.745
What?

18:53.813 --> 18:54.746
The MILF in confession.

18:54.814 --> 18:56.048
Oh, great.

18:56.115 --> 18:57.816
Yeah, as much as I'm sure
that followed protocol,

18:57.884 --> 19:00.686
I'm still gonna have to question her myself.

19:02.322 --> 19:03.522
Father, I'm gonna need you

19:03.590 --> 19:05.958
to come into the station for a statement.

19:08.361 --> 19:09.828
Well, maybe the padre has a twin brother

19:09.896 --> 19:11.897
who also takes confession; that
way he could still be guilty.

19:11.965 --> 19:14.866
- Lucifer, seriously, will you just...
- (tires screeching)

19:15.802 --> 19:16.969
Get down!

19:32.819 --> 19:35.654
And you wonder why I don't go to church.

19:42.559 --> 19:44.326
CHLOE: <i>I caught a partial</i>
<i>from the shooter's plate.</i>

19:44.394 --> 19:45.861
Can you run this for me?

19:45.929 --> 19:47.196
- You got it.
- Thank you.

19:47.263 --> 19:49.631
So I spoke to Father Frank's alibi.

19:49.699 --> 19:51.000
Checks out.

19:51.067 --> 19:52.468
He was in confession with Mrs. Madison

19:52.535 --> 19:53.635
from 11:00 to 12:00.

19:53.703 --> 19:54.903
He's not our guy.

19:54.971 --> 19:56.171
(sighs) Well, maybe she's lying.

19:56.239 --> 19:58.374
I mean, you know the sort
of people that go to church.

19:58.441 --> 19:59.708
Sinners. (chuckles)

19:59.776 --> 20:03.212
Lab results from the voice
modulator came back empty.

20:03.279 --> 20:05.714
No prints, no DNA.

20:05.782 --> 20:07.249
What, so you think this shooting

20:07.317 --> 20:09.718
and the youth director's
death are connected?

20:09.786 --> 20:12.154
We know they have at least
one thing in common.

20:13.493 --> 20:15.927
Father, you will be relieved
to know that no one was injured.

20:15.995 --> 20:17.896
- Oh, thank God.
- Please don't.

20:17.964 --> 20:19.931
You care to tell us what that was about?

20:19.999 --> 20:21.366
The shooting?

20:21.434 --> 20:22.834
I don't know.

20:22.902 --> 20:24.102
(scoffs)

20:24.170 --> 20:25.604
This wasn't a random attack.

20:25.671 --> 20:27.839
They were shooting at you.

20:27.907 --> 20:29.107
But you don't seem surprised.

20:29.175 --> 20:30.809
What aren't you telling us?

20:36.249 --> 20:38.946
MODULATED VOICE: Keep your nose
out of our business or else.

20:39.495 --> 20:41.030
The voice modulator from Arietta's office.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.821
You should have gone
to the police with this.

20:42.889 --> 20:46.458
I assumed it was Arietta,
and I'm not afraid of him.

20:46.526 --> 20:48.593
But if it's The Spider...

20:48.661 --> 20:50.228
Spider?

20:50.296 --> 20:51.596
I've heard whispers of another dealer

20:51.664 --> 20:52.998
trying to take over Arietta's business.

20:53.065 --> 20:55.033
People call him "The Spider."

20:55.101 --> 20:56.735
Scary, violent reputation.

20:56.802 --> 20:58.370
Do you know who this Spider is?

20:58.437 --> 21:00.672
I don't.

21:00.740 --> 21:03.074
You're holding something back, Father.
I can tell.

21:04.777 --> 21:06.478
LUCIFER: Hmm?

21:06.546 --> 21:07.746
I have a confession to make.

21:07.813 --> 21:09.873
LUCIFER: Finally! Well, the truth

21:09.986 --> 21:11.986
will set you free... isn't that
what your beloved book says?

21:12.002 --> 21:14.603
I lied when I said Connor was
in danger of becoming involved.

21:14.657 --> 21:16.625
He already is. Dealing for Arietta.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.759
What, that's it?

21:17.827 --> 21:18.861
Oh, please don't tell me

21:18.909 --> 21:20.176
that's what you've been
holding back all this time.

21:20.663 --> 21:22.464
Wait. If Connor's already in deep,

21:22.531 --> 21:23.732
why go to all this trouble to protect him?

21:23.799 --> 21:26.034
He's had it rough.

21:26.102 --> 21:27.736
Thinks he can only rely on himself.

21:27.803 --> 21:30.005
He's a good kid, Detective.

21:30.072 --> 21:31.907
There's still hope for him.

21:31.974 --> 21:34.743
Father, you were today's target.

21:34.810 --> 21:36.311
We need to worry about your safety first.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.747
Do you have a place to stay?

21:38.814 --> 21:39.748
We can offer police protection.

21:39.815 --> 21:41.549
I'm fine right here.

21:43.286 --> 21:45.153
This... is my sanctuary.

23:55.484 --> 23:57.185
we used to play together.

23:57.253 --> 24:00.088
Another car swerved into our lane and, uh...

Connor lost both his parents that night.
