WEBVTT

00:02.834 --> 00:04.700
Keep your arm steady.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.800
Aim and follow through.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.667
Oh, my goodness!
I got 100 points!

00:13.667 --> 00:16.133
Nice going, Russo.
Try it on your own this time.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.967
On my own?
Oh...

00:18.967 --> 00:22.967
No. Now I'm torn between
admitting I've gotten
pretty good at skeeball

00:22.967 --> 00:28.100
and wanting you to keep
doing that cuddly, guiding
my arm thing you were doing.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.567
- Let's get something to eat.
- OK.

00:36.133 --> 00:37.500
[pushes button]

00:37.500 --> 00:40.133
<i>[woman] Welcome to</i>
<i>Betty's and Fleming's.</i>

00:40.133 --> 00:42.934
<i>Please tap in your order.</i>

00:42.934 --> 00:45.500
I'll order for you.
It's romantic.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.133
Barbecue bacon cheese burger
with curly fries...

00:49.133 --> 00:50.300
...in the bun.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.133
And a double
chocolate shake,

00:52.133 --> 00:54.133
with whipped cream
on the bottom.

00:56.033 --> 00:59.033
You know me.

00:59.033 --> 01:01.500
Doesn't it freak you out
how perfect we are together?

01:01.500 --> 01:04.133
Nah, I don't
think about it.

01:04.133 --> 01:08.467
'Cause then I'd be thinking
instead of enjoying it.

01:09.367 --> 01:12.100
Dean, you just made sense.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.300
This is the best date ever.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.767
Do that thing I think is cool.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.300
[snaps fingers]

01:17.300 --> 01:19.800
[giggles] Again.
I love that!

01:19.800 --> 01:21.200
Oh!

01:21.200 --> 01:24.500
Finger snapping,
bacon burgers, milkshakes...

01:24.500 --> 01:27.133
It's like I'm a princess.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.500
[snapping fingers]

01:31.100 --> 01:33.834
[grunts] Ah!

01:33.834 --> 01:35.400
[inhales]

01:35.400 --> 01:37.734
[exhales] What a nice dream.

01:37.734 --> 01:41.700
[alarm ringing]

01:41.700 --> 01:45.000
Oh, man. I'm late for school.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.133
[chuckles]

01:46.133 --> 01:48.100
Try again tomorrow.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.200
See you in your dreams
tomorrow night, Dean.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.400
Oh, Gosh!

01:56.400 --> 01:58.100
Harper, what are
you doing here?

01:58.100 --> 02:00.066
Waiting for you to stop
using the dream helmet.

02:00.066 --> 02:01.967
Hurry up. We're gonna
be late for school.

02:01.967 --> 02:04.567
We can't sneak in because
I'm wearing my squeaky shoes.

02:04.567 --> 02:07.000
[shoes squeaking]

02:07.000 --> 02:10.767
Harper, I just had another
perfect date with Dean.

02:10.767 --> 02:13.400
He took me to that touch-screen
place and ordered for me...

02:13.400 --> 02:14.734
Dean moved away months ago.

02:14.734 --> 02:17.200
You've got to stop using magic
to date him in his dreams.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.700
- It's just wrong.
- Look...

02:19.700 --> 02:21.700
I go into his dreams
and I control everything,

02:21.700 --> 02:23.567
so it's exactly
the way I want.

02:23.567 --> 02:26.000
Since Dean moved away,
our relationship has
never been better.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.100
Do you ever listen
to yourself?

02:28.100 --> 02:31.867
Or is there some
invisible shield that
blocks the words from your ears?

02:31.867 --> 02:34.567
You're just mad because
I went to Betty's and
Fleming's without you.

02:34.567 --> 02:38.200
[scoffs]

02:38.200 --> 02:41.567
No, I'm not.
Touch screen ordering?

02:41.567 --> 02:44.000
It's dehumanizing when a robot
gets your order wrong.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.667
And, if we don't watch out,
robots are going to unite
and take over everything.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.967
How do you know I'm not one...
I'm not one...

02:51.967 --> 02:53.200
- I'm not one...
- It's happening!

[Juliet]
Tears of Blood totally rocked.

03:48.233 --> 03:51.133
I'm not just saying that because
I'm a vampire and love anything
to do with blood.

03:51.133 --> 03:52.567
I had so much fun with you,

03:52.567 --> 03:55.300
I completely ignored my
self-prescribed bedtime.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.367
[yawns]

03:57.367 --> 04:00.800
I'm gonna get, like, 37
minutes less sleep than usual.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.934
But totally worth it.

04:02.934 --> 04:04.600
Oh, hey, Justin!

04:04.600 --> 04:07.400
So, my family and I are
going away on vacation.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.900
And I don't want to be away
from you for that long.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.467
So, I was wondering if you want
to come with us to the lake?

04:12.467 --> 04:15.600
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
That would be great.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.300
I'm gonna ask my parents.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.600
I mean, they can't still
treat me like I'm a kid.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.900
They can't say I'm not ready
to go away with my girlfriend
and her family.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.500
Sounds like fun.
Juliet's a sweet girl.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.567
Stop yelling at me!
I get it.

04:29.567 --> 04:32.300
You don't want me to go.

04:32.300 --> 04:38.700
Justin, I'm giving you
my permission to go away
with your vampire girlfriend.

04:38.700 --> 04:42.967
As long as you're hanging
upside down in separate rooms.

04:42.967 --> 04:47.233
Great. But, we should
probably ask Mom, huh?

04:47.233 --> 04:48.867
She might think
that Juliet and I

04:48.867 --> 04:50.500
are getting
too serious too fast.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.400
Which we're not.

04:54.233 --> 04:59.000
Even though a lot of people
and parenting books might
say that we are.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.367
Justin, you've got to stop
buying me those parenting books.

05:03.367 --> 05:04.734
I'm not gonna read them.

05:09.734 --> 05:12.133
Dean's here?

05:12.133 --> 05:14.400
Alex, are we in one of your
dream dates right now?

05:14.400 --> 05:15.500
Dean?

05:16.867 --> 05:19.233
No, it really is Dean.
He is here.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.867
It's really me, Russo.
Finkle.

05:21.867 --> 05:25.400
Moriarty. It's been long enough.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.400
I believe a friendly
hug is in order.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.934
Alright,
I'm not ready.

05:32.934 --> 05:37.400
- Ah! Same old Finkle.
- [squeals]

05:38.200 --> 05:39.967
What are you doing here?

05:39.967 --> 05:42.133
Well, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.100
And you've been in
a lot of my dreams.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.233
- Wha...
- Oh. [laughs]

05:46.233 --> 05:49.367
So I took my vacation days
from school a little early.

05:49.367 --> 05:52.734
You don't get to choose your
vacation days from school.

05:52.734 --> 05:54.800
This is why I don't hug you.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.600
- Dean hug her.
- [screaming]

06:03.700 --> 06:05.100
Justin, hey!

06:05.100 --> 06:07.300
Did you talk to your dad?
Can you go?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.500
Uh, yeah, I talked to him.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.400
And he said... no.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.300
I... I can't go.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.600
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.200
Wait! It's not because
I'm a vampire is it?

06:22.200 --> 06:25.500
No! They're
totally over that.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.900
You're like the most normal
magical girl I've ever dated.

06:29.900 --> 06:33.300
Yeah. Alex told me
about the werewolf.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.300
Um, my dad...

06:40.300 --> 06:42.700
He reads all these
parenting books and,

06:42.700 --> 06:45.300
apparently, they say
it's not a good idea.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.934
I got mad at him
though, so mad.

06:47.934 --> 06:50.400
And he got this serious look
on his face and he was like:

06:50.400 --> 06:54.100
"No way, Justin. And
don't bring it up again."

06:54.100 --> 06:55.600
So if you see him...

06:55.600 --> 06:58.700
...wouldn't bring
it up if I were you.

06:59.867 --> 07:03.400
- Well, did he say why?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:03.400 --> 07:07.200
Something about us getting
too serious too fast.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.500
I mean, we are getting
pretty serious.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.133
I'm fine with it.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.500
But you know parents.

07:14.500 --> 07:18.767
They get all serious
about getting serious.

07:21.934 --> 07:23.500
Well, I'll really miss you.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.000
Me too.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.934
I should get back to work.

07:28.934 --> 07:32.100
OK. Um...

07:37.567 --> 07:38.967
The usual, please.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.734
Mustard? Again?

07:44.734 --> 07:47.600
What's going on with you?
You know the usual has ketchup.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.700
Right.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.600
Don't call the cops.
I'll fix it.

07:57.734 --> 08:00.300
We need to figure out
what's happening between us.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.667
I think I figured out
what's happening.

08:04.667 --> 08:05.967
You're holding up
the line.

08:05.967 --> 08:07.900
Next!

08:13.834 --> 08:16.100
Yes! I nailed it.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.767
OK, you have enough tickets
to buy a pencil sharpener now.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.400
Can I go?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.767
Come on, Russo. You know
you're no good at skeeball.

08:23.767 --> 08:24.767
Right. Yes.

08:24.767 --> 08:28.100
But maybe
you could show me

08:28.100 --> 08:31.400
by guiding my arm in a
cuddly way, like this.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.000
Yeah, right.

08:36.867 --> 08:39.867
Oh, sweet!
I beat my own record.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.400
Let's eat.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.200
[pushes button]

08:54.200 --> 08:56.467
<i>[woman] Welcome</i>
<i>to Betty's and Fleming's.</i>

08:56.467 --> 08:59.233
<i>Please tap in your order.</i>

08:59.233 --> 09:01.000
Oh. Are you
ordering for me?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.734
- No. I'm playing<i>Bonko.</i>
- [computer beeping]

09:03.734 --> 09:06.200
Shoot. I bonked out.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.367
I'm going again. You got any
money left on your game card?

09:08.367 --> 09:10.300
Uh, Dean...

09:10.300 --> 09:13.400
You're not really
paying attention to me.

09:14.767 --> 09:17.667
What are you talking about?
I'm here, aren't I?

09:19.100 --> 09:21.767
Yes, but we haven't
seen each other in months,

09:21.767 --> 09:24.600
and you're more interested
in this stupid<i>Bonko</i>game.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.600
OK, fine.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.967
Why don't you
order your food?

09:29.500 --> 09:32.367
You want me to order myself?
You don't want to order for me?

09:32.367 --> 09:34.000
No, actually,
you order for me.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
I'm gonna go get that pencil
sharpener from the prize tent.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.834
Dean, this is a date.
We're staying together.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.100
[sighs]

09:46.100 --> 09:49.800
Barbecue bacon cheese burger,
with curly fries inside the bun.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.734
A double chocolate shake,
with whipped cream
on the bottom.

09:55.233 --> 09:57.667
You've got to stop
eating like that.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.934
A giant of hunk of meat
will just wreck your heart.

09:59.934 --> 10:04.033
Yeah, that's not the only thing
that's wrecking my heart.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.100
Bonko!

10:12.033 --> 10:15.233
- Well, you were right.
- I knew it.

10:15.233 --> 10:17.600
I'm in your dream.
Can I fly?

10:17.600 --> 10:21.100
- When do I get wavy?
- Harper! This isn't a dream.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.767
You were right
about me and Dean.

10:23.767 --> 10:28.000
We've grown apart and
I've been fooling myself
by going into his dreams.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.500
You only made it worse,
because you created Dream Dean

10:30.500 --> 10:32.900
and you now expect Real Dean
to be someone he's not.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.734
I said you were right. See,
a lot of times you are right,

10:35.734 --> 10:38.367
and this is exactly
why I don't tell you.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.300
So what are you
going to do?

10:40.300 --> 10:43.200
I'm gonna do what I should've
done in the first place.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.767
I'm gonna
break up with him.

10:44.767 --> 10:48.600
- Breaking up is always hard.
- How do you know?

10:48.600 --> 10:51.500
You're making it hard
to be supportive.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.367
But, Harper,
you're right.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.767
It is going to be hard.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.467
I don't want to
hurt his feelings.

10:59.467 --> 11:02.500
This would be so much easier
if he just broke up with me.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.567
Hey, that's a good idea!
Get him to break up with you.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.100
I could do that.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.000
But it'll be a challenge
because you're awesome.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.233
I like you.

11:13.233 --> 11:15.600
- Oh, that's such a relief.
- Really?

11:15.600 --> 11:18.900
I get a little insecure from
time to time, but I'm back.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.500
- Mr. Russo. Is Justin around?
- I haven't seen him.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.400
He must be packing
for his big trip.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.500
Why would he be packing?
He can't go.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.100
He can't go?

11:32.100 --> 11:34.200
He'll be so disappointed.
He was really excited.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.000
Yeah, yeah. I know.
So why can't he go?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I don't know,
you haven't told me.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.100
So you didn't say, "no"?

11:41.100 --> 11:44.600
No. I mean,
yes, I didn't say no.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.567
- Are we clear here?
- I think so.

11:47.567 --> 11:50.200
Good. Because I'm not.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.500
You said "yes"
and he said "no."

11:53.500 --> 11:55.100
Oh!

11:55.100 --> 11:58.200
[whistling]

11:58.200 --> 12:01.400
- Justin.
- Hey.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.300
Why did you say you couldn't
go on vacation when you could?

12:03.300 --> 12:06.000
Because... I...

12:06.000 --> 12:07.967
I didn't think
this moment would happen.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.400
Because if I did...

12:09.400 --> 12:11.400
...probably wouldn't
have done it.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.567
If you didn't want to go with
me you should've just said so.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.100
Look, Juliet, I'm...

12:19.667 --> 12:22.667
I'm... [sighs]

12:22.667 --> 12:25.367
I'm... sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

12:27.100 --> 12:30.400
It is probably because
of the 37 minutes
of sleep I lost.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.600
I am no good with less
than eight hours of sleep.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.867
Yeah. Well, it looks like
you're no good with more than
eight hours sleep either.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.400
Hey, Max. Maybe you can
help me with something.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.100
How do you get your brother to
say what's really on his mind?

12:51.100 --> 12:54.400
- Oh, I use randomness.
- What?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.834
Well, I just say random things
and while people are

12:56.834 --> 13:00.767
trying to figure it out, they
say stuff that's on their mind.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.300
Have you ever noticed that
pineapples never wear bathrobes?

13:03.300 --> 13:06.467
Why...
Why would you even say that?

13:06.467 --> 13:09.500
We were talking about how
Justin doesn't want to go
on vacation with me,

13:09.500 --> 13:11.000
and how I'm
really upset by that,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
because I think I might
be in love with him.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.200
Hey. That random thing
really works.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.667
What?
What random thing?

13:20.667 --> 13:23.133
I haven't even done it yet.

13:33.033 --> 13:34.800
OK, how about this idea?

13:34.800 --> 13:39.233
Dean will totally break up
with you if you wear something
totally repulsive.

13:39.233 --> 13:42.600
I could use a spell
to make me a slob.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.100
I mean, nobody wants
to date someone gross.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.000
OK.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.900
What I need now is
the opposite of clean.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.100
Make me a girl
without hygiene.

13:56.734 --> 13:58.600
Whoa!

13:58.600 --> 13:59.934
You're hideous.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.200
Awesome. It worked.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.734
- [screams]
- [coughing] OK.

14:07.734 --> 14:12.600
Normally I'd stick around and
check out whatever flies out
of that nest on your head...

14:12.600 --> 14:15.200
...but you reek.
Keep your arms down, please.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.800
Hey, Harper. What's up?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.500
Your chances of getting a rash.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.400
- Whoa!
- Hi, baby.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.600
Oh, wait. Let me fix myself.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.934
Hi, baby.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.033
Oh, man.

14:32.033 --> 14:34.300
I'm gonna try and say this
as nice as I can...

14:34.300 --> 14:37.600
...but you look like something
I snaked out of my shower drain.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.400
Well. I held myself
together for our date,

14:41.400 --> 14:42.834
but this is really
the way I am.

14:42.834 --> 14:46.400
- It's pretty disgusting, huh?
- Oh! Yeah. You are.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.033
Makes you not want
to be around me.

14:48.033 --> 14:49.934
I totally understand.

14:49.934 --> 14:53.000
No, I get it.
This is because of me.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.967
Well, yeah.

14:54.967 --> 14:57.667
Since I left, you've been
overwhelmed with sadness...

14:57.667 --> 15:00.066
...and you just
let yourself go.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.300
I've seen people
like you on talk shows.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.300
Don't worry, I'm gonna
help you get back on track.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.300
- Where's the floss?
- What? No. Dean. No.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.300
- That's not what I want.
- Ooh! Of course not.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.900
And you probably don't want
a warm wash cloth behind
the ears either.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.400
Now, where's
your wash cloth?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.567
I thought you'd see me
like this and want to break up.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.400
You want to break up?

15:24.400 --> 15:26.700
Well, now that you
bring it up...

15:26.700 --> 15:29.567
Since it's your idea and all
I think that maybe, maybe we...

15:29.567 --> 15:31.300
We should.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.133
OK. Then let's break up.

15:36.133 --> 15:40.700
Really?
Oh? Well...

15:40.700 --> 15:42.200
...that was easy.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
That was really easy.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.767
That was really, really easy.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.567
No big deal. See ya.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.700
What was that?

16:02.500 --> 16:04.033
Hey, Dad.

16:04.033 --> 16:06.800
You must have noticed how down
I was and wanted to come talk.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.600
No. We need the table.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.500
- OK. We can talk.
- [clears throat]

16:17.600 --> 16:19.800
I lied to Juliet and
now she's mad at me.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.000
About that. Why didn't you
want to go on the vacation?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.800
- You really like Juliet.
- I know.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.500
It's just, I've never been
in a relationship this long.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.567
And going on vacation with
a girl and her family...

16:30.567 --> 16:33.233
It's... I mean,
it's serious and...

16:33.233 --> 16:35.934
It just feels like
it's happening fast.

16:35.934 --> 16:37.934
So you're afraid.

16:37.934 --> 16:42.400
Why? I mean, it's not like they
were going to have you sleep
in a guest coffin.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.000
I think they were.

16:46.233 --> 16:48.700
Look, Justin, I...

16:48.700 --> 16:50.800
Going away with a
girl's family is a big step.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.867
And I said "yes" because
I think you're ready.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.200
Having your first
serious girlfriend

16:56.200 --> 16:58.000
is all part
of growing up.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.600
You read those
parenting books.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.133
It was on the back.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.800
[sighs]
I really messed up.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.300
Messing up is also
part of growing up.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.000
I'm still growing up.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.200
Just ask your mother.

17:17.100 --> 17:18.767
So what do I do now?

17:18.767 --> 17:20.900
Tell her you want to go
on the vacation with her.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.500
I can't. They already left.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.300
Here.

17:28.033 --> 17:30.700
I feel bad enough without
you throwing things at me.

17:33.233 --> 17:35.500
These are the keys
to the flying carpet.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.400
Why don't you see if you
can't catch up with her.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.400
Thanks, Dad.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.000
And then I said
I wanted to break up.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.200
He agreed,
and then just walked out.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.033
- I mean, what was that?
- I don't get it.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.667
You wanted to break up
and you did.

17:49.667 --> 17:51.200
Mission accomplished, right?

17:52.033 --> 17:55.467
Yeah, sure, I got what I wanted.

17:55.467 --> 17:58.400
I don't know. I guess I just
thought he'd fight for me.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.834
Well, it was a pretty
convincing spell.

18:00.834 --> 18:03.033
And you know Dean,
he doesn't talk a lot,

18:03.033 --> 18:05.233
say what he's thinking,
or share much.

18:05.233 --> 18:06.867
What'd you see in him?

18:06.867 --> 18:11.100
Well, Dream Dean was good
at expressing himself.

18:11.100 --> 18:14.133
Well, he wasn't real,
and you were controlling it.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.133
I know.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.400
And it was wrong.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.567
You know I'm against this,

18:22.567 --> 18:24.700
but you could go back into
Dean's dream one more time

18:24.700 --> 18:26.734
and get the break up
you really wanted.

18:28.867 --> 18:31.200
- You're awesome.
- I like you.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.367
Oh, that's a relief.

18:32.367 --> 18:34.367
- Really?
- No. I always knew.

18:46.734 --> 18:50.200
- Hey, Russo.
- Hi, Dean. Listen...

18:50.200 --> 18:53.400
Most of the time I come
into your dreams and I
control everything.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.500
But not this time.
It's your dream.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.600
You can say and do
whatever you want.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.400
I can?

19:02.300 --> 19:03.400
Cool.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.300
- Abraham Lincoln?
- Yeah.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.800
Well, it's my dream, and in my
dreams, I like to have the 16th
president as my wing man.

19:17.033 --> 19:18.300
So what's up, Russo?

19:19.867 --> 19:22.200
Oh, I wanted to talk
to you about our break up.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.200
- I don't know.
- Go ahead, Dean.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.200
Tell her how you really feel.
It's best to be honest.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.600
After all,
that is my nickname.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.600
What does Mister One Six
have to do with honesty?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.800
I'll let you wear
my stovepipe hat.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.300
[laughs] OK.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.100
Here it is.

19:47.100 --> 19:50.400
I couldn't be real with you
when we broke up because...

19:50.400 --> 19:52.200
...it was just too painful.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.567
- It was?
- Yeah, it was.

19:56.567 --> 19:59.000
I've never known
anyone like you.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.600
And the only way for me to
get through it was to tell you
that it was no big deal.

20:04.033 --> 20:06.500
You'll always be
my first love, Alex.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.600
That's one thing
that will never change.

20:10.367 --> 20:11.967
Same here.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.734
Goodbye, Dean.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.734
All right!

20:35.300 --> 20:40.233
Well, alright... [exhales]
Let's play some skeeball.

20:45.867 --> 20:48.200
Juliet, wait up!

20:48.900 --> 20:50.233
Justin!

20:50.233 --> 20:52.934
My dad loaned me
his flying carpet.

20:52.934 --> 20:55.300
I am so glad you came.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.500
Hey, um...

20:56.500 --> 20:59.200
I have to talk to you
about something.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.100
Remember when you said
you loved me?

21:01.100 --> 21:05.300
Yeah. That was embarrassing.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.000
No, no. It wasn't.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.500
Because...

21:09.500 --> 21:10.667
...I love you, too.

21:10.667 --> 21:14.367
What? I can't hear you?
Fly closer.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.800
I said,

21:18.800 --> 21:20.400
I love you, too.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.767
I love you, too, too.

21:26.367 --> 21:27.900
- Hey!
- whoa!

21:29.934 --> 21:31.233
[engine sputtering]

21:31.233 --> 21:33.300
Why does your carpet
make so much noise?

21:33.300 --> 21:36.033
Um, yeah, it...

21:36.033 --> 21:39.367
It needs a tune up.
It might break down.

21:39.367 --> 21:41.834
Don't worry.
If you fall, I'll catch you.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.700
I know that we've had
our problems,

21:55.700 --> 21:57.934
but I really want
to work it out.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.667
Do you want to...

22:01.667 --> 22:03.700
...pass out fliers?

22:03.700 --> 22:05.934
If that's what it takes.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.834
All right.

22:08.834 --> 22:10.934
One usual coming up.

22:13.233 --> 22:16.967
Nice gesture wearing
that hot dog suit for me.

22:16.967 --> 22:18.500
- [chuckles]
- What?

22:18.500 --> 22:21.367
Oh, this? Oh, no!
It's not for you.

22:21.367 --> 22:23.734
It's for something
I'm doing later.
