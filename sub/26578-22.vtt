WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:03.070
Gangway! Bedpans coming through.

00:03.148 --> 00:04.859
I pray you do not drop those.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.237
Doubly so if they are fully loaded.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.250
Fr. Abdi.
You here to perform Last Rites?

00:09.312 --> 00:11.576
If you need me to,
I don't mind closing their eyes.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.217
The trick is a light touch.

00:13.246 --> 00:15.006
Just enough to get the lids started.

00:15.048 --> 00:17.482
I am bringing these old people
the comfort of God,

00:17.584 --> 00:18.850
although for many of them

00:18.952 --> 00:20.279
morphine does the heavy lifting.

00:20.387 --> 00:21.453
Yeah, a lot of the patients

00:21.555 --> 00:22.988
in this side of the building
are pretty out of it.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.456
I'm not too comfortable around them.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.524
Then they are the ones
who need you the most.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.260
Extend yourself, Frank, as a Christian.

00:28.285 --> 00:29.271
Give them your friendship.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.395
Is it really a friendship

00:30.497 --> 00:32.296
if they keep mistaking me
for little Ephraim

00:32.399 --> 00:33.732
who died of typhus?

00:33.834 --> 00:37.068
Just go in any of these rooms,
talk, and hold their hands.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.038
Then afterwards, wash yours
with the very hottest water

00:40.140 --> 00:41.172
'cause these folks have diseases

00:41.274 --> 00:42.840
we thought were wiped out decades ago.

00:42.934 --> 00:44.575
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

00:44.611 --> 00:46.144
Fair warning... a screw from the pot lid

00:46.246 --> 00:47.345
fell into the potatoes.

00:47.447 --> 00:48.680
So swallow more than chew.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.348
Actually, don't swallow it.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.550
This family is already asking
too much of that toilet.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.687
I feel bad for the toilet,
I always apologize.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.122
I got a parish council meeting tomorrow.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.424
They're worried donations
are down at the church.

00:59.526 --> 01:00.625
Well, they'll have
to tighten their belts

01:00.727 --> 01:02.127
like everybody else.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.962
I suggest smaller communion wafers.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.697
There, I just saved them
a million dollars.

01:05.799 --> 01:06.698
Our grade school needs that money

01:06.800 --> 01:07.999
for new playground equipment.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.201
Yeah, I'm fed up with
that lopsided teeter-totter.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.037
In my day we made our own teeter-totter.

01:12.139 --> 01:13.998
Balanced a plank on this guy named Chip

01:14.063 --> 01:15.429
who liked to hang around the schoolyard.

01:15.537 --> 01:18.276
Older guy. Always had candy.

01:18.378 --> 01:20.178
Strange fella but sturdy back.

01:20.260 --> 01:21.793
I'm worried about all these cutbacks

01:21.895 --> 01:22.927
affecting St. Agnes'.

01:23.029 --> 01:25.330
They might have to close
their doors forever.

01:25.432 --> 01:27.632
Oh, no! How will the old people get out?

01:27.734 --> 01:29.968
They usually get rolled out feet-first.

01:30.070 --> 01:31.870
You know, in Japanese culture,
old people don't get

01:31.972 --> 01:33.138
sent off to homes.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.572
All generations live under one roof.

01:34.674 --> 01:35.840
Okay, well, what do the Japanese know?

01:35.942 --> 01:37.475
They can't even operate a fork.

01:38.979 --> 01:41.079
The church needs to stop wasting
money on children,

01:41.181 --> 01:42.447
and put it into old people.

01:42.549 --> 01:43.648
They're the future.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.950
That's a surprising
point of view from you, Mom.

01:46.052 --> 01:47.652
<i>My mother's sudden
concern for the elderly</i>

01:47.754 --> 01:50.188
<i>wasn't so much surprising
as it was self-serving.</i>

01:50.290 --> 01:51.756
<i>A few months back
Mom's ancient Aunt Tess</i>

01:51.858 --> 01:53.491
<i>had suddenly become her responsibility,</i>

01:53.593 --> 01:55.360
<i>so my folks moved her into St. Agnes'.</i>

01:55.462 --> 01:56.928
<i>Aunt Tess didn't really mind...</i>

01:57.030 --> 01:59.898
What time does the ship dock
in Ashtabula, Captain?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.167
<i>...because she didn't have
much of a mind left.</i>

02:02.269 --> 02:05.203
Say hello to my cousin George
from Collinsville.

02:05.305 --> 02:07.405
You think it's okay for us to go?

02:07.507 --> 02:09.607
- I said say hello!
- Hello.

02:09.709 --> 02:11.409
Now where's my Honey Baked Ham?

02:11.511 --> 02:13.111
<i>Much like Aunt Tess, we kids had no idea</i>

02:13.213 --> 02:16.273
<i>who or where she was,
which is how Mom wanted it.</i>

02:16.359 --> 02:17.515
If things don't pick up,

02:17.617 --> 02:19.651
the St. Agnes' folks
might have to relocate

02:19.753 --> 02:21.553
to other more expensive homes.

02:21.655 --> 02:23.788
Or move in with loved ones.
Or even family.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.056
<i>The last thing my mother wanted</i>

02:25.158 --> 02:27.125
<i>was another mush-brained
goofball under her roof.</i>

02:27.227 --> 02:29.194
Potato mill!

02:31.031 --> 02:32.330
Knock it off.

02:32.432 --> 02:34.899
What? I'm straining it for screws.

02:35.001 --> 02:37.001
Found the screw!

02:37.103 --> 02:39.671
Swallowed it. Sorry, toilet!

02:39.773 --> 02:40.872
<i>My mom made up her mind...</i>

02:40.974 --> 02:42.407
<i>the church had to find the money</i>

02:42.509 --> 02:44.576
<i>to keep St. Agnes' open.</i>

02:44.678 --> 02:45.777
Is that Davey's snake?

02:45.879 --> 02:47.545
I'm snake-sitting while he and his mom

02:47.647 --> 02:49.614
are on a wine tasting trip
with her boyfriend.

02:49.716 --> 02:52.016
They brought Davey along
because he just got his permit

02:52.118 --> 02:53.284
and they're drunks.

02:53.353 --> 02:55.119
- Can I hold him?
- Sure.

02:56.356 --> 02:57.589
Oh! I'm sorry.

02:57.691 --> 03:00.358
I was all braced for slimy,
but he was disturbingly dry.

03:00.460 --> 03:01.793
He's getting away!

03:01.895 --> 03:03.461
Don't just stand there, find him.

03:03.563 --> 03:05.263
That snake is the closest thing
to a father

03:05.365 --> 03:06.431
Davey has ever known.

03:06.533 --> 03:07.599
There he is!

03:07.667 --> 03:08.967
Careful. Do not scare him.

03:09.069 --> 03:11.069
We won't.

03:11.171 --> 03:12.470
He looks grumpy.

03:12.539 --> 03:14.939
Like Dad in the car
when someone sits on his maps.

03:15.008 --> 03:16.574
- The can.
- Grab the stick.

03:16.643 --> 03:18.743
- Use the stick. Use the stick.
- Yeah, I know. That's what I'm doing.

03:18.812 --> 03:20.578
Get him in the can. Stop, stop, stop.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.013
- A little more...
- You got it!

03:22.082 --> 03:23.848
Got it!

03:23.917 --> 03:25.750
Timmy, you dropped him.
Reach in and pull it out.

03:25.852 --> 03:27.118
Is Davey sure he's not poisonous?

03:27.220 --> 03:28.286
He's got no idea.

03:28.388 --> 03:29.454
They found that thing in their muffler

03:29.556 --> 03:31.022
when they got home from Mexico.

03:32.392 --> 03:34.826
We're coming up short
on the Sunday collections,

03:34.895 --> 03:36.661
so it's time for a little refresher

03:36.763 --> 03:37.962
for the ushers.

03:38.064 --> 03:39.497
Especially the new recruits.

03:39.599 --> 03:41.866
Hey, guys. Excited to be here.

03:41.935 --> 03:43.601
This basket...

03:43.703 --> 03:45.203
does not fill itself.

03:45.305 --> 03:47.138
Eye contact.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.207
Steady hand.

03:49.276 --> 03:51.276
Really stare 'em down.

03:51.344 --> 03:52.810
We gave them music and a cracker.

03:52.879 --> 03:54.279
Time to pay the piper.

03:54.347 --> 03:56.648
Some very good ideas, Mr. Mike Cleary.

03:56.716 --> 03:58.750
But all this laying on of guilt-trips?

03:58.852 --> 04:00.585
Do we want people to come
to mass to feel shame?

04:00.654 --> 04:02.186
This is still
the Catholic church, right?

04:02.255 --> 04:04.322
We can't afford to be
namby-pamby about money.

04:04.424 --> 04:05.623
I come from a tradition

04:05.692 --> 04:07.258
where the Church serves the congregants,

04:07.360 --> 04:08.927
- not the other way around.
- Yeah, I'm sure that's fine

04:08.995 --> 04:10.828
when the collection basket is a gourd

04:10.897 --> 04:13.831
and they're filling it
with beads and animal teeth.

04:13.934 --> 04:15.667
No judgment, but with Fr. Dunne,

04:15.735 --> 04:17.135
these meetings were about how to spend

04:17.202 --> 04:18.603
all the money coming in.

04:18.704 --> 04:20.071
I mean, you take over,
donations are down.

04:20.173 --> 04:21.505
Again, no judgment.

04:21.608 --> 04:23.274
What would it sound like with judgment?

04:23.343 --> 04:24.709
So much worse.

04:24.778 --> 04:26.811
As much as we all miss Fr. Dunne,

04:26.880 --> 04:29.380
I believe God will answer
our monetary prayers.

04:29.482 --> 04:30.481
Praying is nice,

04:30.550 --> 04:31.783
but we need something that works.

04:31.851 --> 04:33.918
We have to help
those old folks at St. Agnes'

04:33.987 --> 04:35.787
or the Japanese will beat us again.

04:35.855 --> 04:38.122
St. Agnes will be getting
all of our proceeds

04:38.224 --> 04:40.091
from our glamorous Monte Carlo Night,

04:40.160 --> 04:42.527
with blackjack tables and fondue.

04:42.595 --> 04:44.762
Yeah, melted cheese
on rented felt tables?

04:45.966 --> 04:47.565
We won't be getting that deposit back.

04:47.634 --> 04:48.733
Hello, everybody.

04:48.802 --> 04:51.235
Oh, Fr. Dunne,
what an unexpected pleasure.

04:51.338 --> 04:52.303
Not Father,

04:52.405 --> 04:53.538
just Cecil.

04:53.640 --> 04:54.605
I'm sorry I'm late.

04:54.708 --> 04:57.442
I was, uh... making love to my wife.

04:57.544 --> 05:00.778
First time during the day...
very interesting.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.014
I invited Cecil to stop by.

05:03.116 --> 05:05.516
I'm not here to step
on anyone's cassock, Father.

05:05.618 --> 05:07.652
Just tell him what you did
when you ran things here

05:07.754 --> 05:09.120
that made everything so much better.

05:09.189 --> 05:12.223
The collection basket
only takes you so far.

05:12.292 --> 05:13.558
The big money has to come

05:13.660 --> 05:15.493
from deep pockets in the community.

05:15.595 --> 05:16.828
Deep pockets!

05:16.896 --> 05:19.130
Already he's making more sense
than anybody here.

05:19.199 --> 05:21.933
I'd be happy to talk to some
of the business leaders in town,

05:22.035 --> 05:24.035
schmooze them, play some golf...

05:24.104 --> 05:26.137
maybe shake the trees a little.

05:26.206 --> 05:27.905
That is very kind, Cecil,

05:27.974 --> 05:29.340
but I can do my own schmoozing.

05:29.442 --> 05:31.275
I've actually shaken trees.

05:31.378 --> 05:32.377
Mostly for guavas,

05:32.445 --> 05:34.345
but I can no doubt do it for money

05:34.447 --> 05:36.180
just as proficiently.

05:36.282 --> 05:38.683
Well, I'm here to help if you need it.

05:38.785 --> 05:40.485
- He needs it.
- You can help most

05:40.587 --> 05:42.920
by enjoying your retirement
and, uh, afternoon fun

05:43.023 --> 05:44.322
you've discovered with your bride.

05:44.424 --> 05:45.423
Meeting adjourned.

05:45.525 --> 05:46.624
Donut time.

05:46.726 --> 05:47.792
Look, I think it's
a little shortsighted...

05:47.894 --> 05:50.161
Not as shortsighted
as getting between me

05:50.263 --> 05:51.963
and my donuts.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.383
Our little friend had
a good night's sleep,

05:56.431 --> 05:57.797
hopefully he's chilled out.

06:00.499 --> 06:02.099
Jeez, what's he mad at me for?

06:02.138 --> 06:04.171
I even threw a pork chop
in there for him last night.

06:04.249 --> 06:05.548
Snakes actually get more aggressive

06:05.650 --> 06:06.683
after they've eaten.

06:06.752 --> 06:08.918
And I wondered what happened
to my pork chop.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.520
Oh, crud, Dad's coming!

06:10.622 --> 06:12.722
Quick, act casual.

06:14.693 --> 06:16.392
Whatever you're praying for,

06:16.495 --> 06:17.894
I will find out.

06:23.935 --> 06:25.034
We have to say something.

06:25.137 --> 06:27.036
He knows what he's getting himself into.

06:27.105 --> 06:28.972
No. Exactly the opposite.

06:29.074 --> 06:31.641
Would you guys keep it down?
I'm trying to pray.

06:35.614 --> 06:37.480
Great, now he's got Mom's table scraps

06:37.582 --> 06:38.715
to fuel his rage.

06:38.817 --> 06:39.883
No, it's okay,

06:39.985 --> 06:43.019
I prayed for God to turn
the snake into a puppy.

06:43.088 --> 06:45.688
There is no God!

06:45.757 --> 06:46.956
<i>My Mom leaned on Fr. Abdi</i>

06:47.025 --> 06:48.825
<i>to let her go with him
looking for donors,</i>

06:48.927 --> 06:49.993
<i>and Catholics tend</i>

06:50.095 --> 06:52.128
<i>to get more motivated to butter up God</i>

06:52.197 --> 06:54.197
<i>when they think
they're about to meet him.</i>

06:56.601 --> 06:58.468
And the second water buffalo said,

06:58.537 --> 07:00.970
"I wanted to get to the udder side."

07:02.674 --> 07:04.174
Excuse me, Father.

07:04.276 --> 07:05.909
Oh, Mrs. Peggy Cleary.

07:06.011 --> 07:08.011
Did you meet my friend
Mrs. Ava Greenblatt?

07:08.079 --> 07:09.412
Oh, it's my pleasure, honey.

07:09.514 --> 07:10.947
Have some of my daughter's rugelach.

07:11.016 --> 07:13.316
It's very rich,
that's why she's so heavy.

07:13.385 --> 07:14.484
Fr. Abdi's supposed to be here

07:14.553 --> 07:16.519
comforting Mr. Fitzpatrick
across the hall,

07:16.588 --> 07:18.188
who shares our faith and is loaded.

07:18.256 --> 07:19.689
I checked on him but he was asleep.

07:19.791 --> 07:20.924
Well, the nurse says he's awake now,

07:21.026 --> 07:22.025
and she's given him enough pills

07:22.127 --> 07:23.393
to steady his check-signing hand.

07:23.461 --> 07:26.462
Ooh, go. Tell him
the water buffalo joke,

07:26.565 --> 07:27.730
he'll plotz.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.135
Honestly...

07:32.237 --> 07:34.604
Oh, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

07:34.706 --> 07:36.172
I should administer the Last Rites.

07:36.274 --> 07:38.441
As long as the last thing
he writes is a check.

07:38.510 --> 07:41.110
<i>Mr. Fitzpatrick's check-signing
hand did not survive,</i>

07:41.179 --> 07:43.880
<i>so my mom had to go fishing
for a different kind of whale.</i>

07:43.949 --> 07:45.515
<i>...so come on down</i>

07:45.584 --> 07:47.584
<i>to Tex O'Shaughnessy's Auto Kingdom</i>

07:47.686 --> 07:51.183
<i>and say howdy to me
and my trusty dog Fido.</i>

07:51.254 --> 07:52.797
Eh, and, remember,

07:52.858 --> 07:57.794
I'll give you the shirt
off my back to make a deal!

07:57.863 --> 07:59.062
Let's close the deal on this guy

07:59.130 --> 08:00.530
before that thing pecks his eyes out.

08:00.599 --> 08:01.631
Cut!

08:01.733 --> 08:02.732
Sweetheart, hand me a fresh shirt

08:02.834 --> 08:03.800
and my wedding ring.

08:03.902 --> 08:05.802
Nice of you folks to wait.

08:05.871 --> 08:08.671
The public cannot get enough
of these commercials.

08:08.773 --> 08:09.806
Thank you for seeing us,

08:09.908 --> 08:11.774
Mr. Tex O'Shaughnessy of the television.

08:11.843 --> 08:13.409
You don't have to grease
this guy's wheels,

08:13.478 --> 08:15.478
he's got a whole service
department for that.

08:15.547 --> 08:17.680
We are hoping for a...

08:17.782 --> 08:19.782
sizeable donation to our church.

08:19.851 --> 08:22.218
Well, I believe I can manage that

08:22.287 --> 08:23.486
in exchange

08:23.588 --> 08:26.489
for a well-placed ad
in your weekly bulletin.

08:26.558 --> 08:29.993
Plus maybe an occasional mention
in the sermon.

08:30.095 --> 08:32.328
Mm, I don't think
I should be selling cars

08:32.397 --> 08:33.596
from the altar.

08:33.698 --> 08:34.697
Just slip something in.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.732
No one's hanging
on your every word anyway.

08:36.801 --> 08:40.068
You know what? You got that
big stained-glass window, right?

08:40.138 --> 08:43.940
Picture this... Jesus carrying his cross

08:44.009 --> 08:46.843
in the bed of a brand-new El Camino.

08:46.912 --> 08:48.444
This feels like we are getting away

08:48.513 --> 08:50.246
from the proper role of the church.

08:50.315 --> 08:53.816
Well, I am a businessman, Father, but...

08:53.919 --> 08:55.385
I guess I could

08:55.453 --> 08:58.087
donate one of my surplus inventory.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.889
You like this here ragtop?

08:59.991 --> 09:01.324
- Hey.
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.426 --> 09:03.026
She is cherry.

09:03.128 --> 09:06.629
That's very generous, Tex,
but we prefer cash.

09:06.731 --> 09:08.932
Well, you could sell it for cash
or raffle it off.

09:09.034 --> 09:11.501
Or... I could drive it with the top down

09:11.603 --> 09:12.502
and the wind in my hair

09:12.604 --> 09:14.170
on my way to visiting the wretched.

09:14.239 --> 09:16.306
Fr. Dunne's old Bonneville's
a real clunker.

09:16.408 --> 09:17.874
Okay, we'll take it,
and we'll raffle it off.

09:17.976 --> 09:19.075
Thank you.

09:19.144 --> 09:21.244
Yes, and I will continue
to drive the Bonneville

09:21.346 --> 09:22.745
right up until I die.

09:22.847 --> 09:24.414
We get it, you're going to Heaven.

09:24.516 --> 09:26.382
This guy.

09:26.484 --> 09:27.717
<i>Frank couldn't stop thinking</i>

09:27.819 --> 09:29.786
<i>about Fr. Abdi's challenge
that he try to bring joy</i>

09:29.854 --> 09:31.321
<i>to those who need it the most</i>

09:31.389 --> 09:34.390
<i>but would remember it the least.</i>

09:34.492 --> 09:36.426
Oh, good. Fully clothed.

09:36.528 --> 09:38.861
Good day, ma'am. How are you?

09:38.964 --> 09:40.463
Paul-Michael,

09:40.565 --> 09:41.898
you're back from the war!

09:42.000 --> 09:42.732
What?

09:42.834 --> 09:44.067
Ring the bell, Paul-Michael!

09:44.135 --> 09:45.735
Uh, ding, ding.

09:45.837 --> 09:48.371
No, don't say "ding, ding."
Just ring the damn bell.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.774
Oh, I hear it now.

09:51.876 --> 09:53.309
So beautiful.

09:53.378 --> 09:55.678
Who's Paul-Michael?
I-Is this Paul-Michael?

09:55.780 --> 09:57.146
Paul-Michael is my horse,

09:57.248 --> 09:58.715
you know that very well, Ephraim.

09:58.783 --> 10:00.883
Oh, I-I figured Ephraim would turn up.

10:00.986 --> 10:02.885
When Daddy lost his job at the mill,

10:02.954 --> 10:04.887
we had to eat Paul-Michael.

10:06.758 --> 10:08.191
Hold on. This is my mom.

10:08.293 --> 10:09.325
Do you know my mom?

10:09.427 --> 10:11.494
That's our dog, Sassafras.

10:11.596 --> 10:13.663
When Daddy lost his job, we ate him.

10:13.765 --> 10:14.497
Ring the bell!

10:14.599 --> 10:16.466
Uh, ding, ding!

10:16.495 --> 10:17.567
Now you got it.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:27.066 --> 10:29.496
I'll take 10 more tickets, please.

10:29.551 --> 10:31.043
It won't look good if you win.

10:31.079 --> 10:32.412
You know what will look good?

10:32.467 --> 10:34.394
Me behind the wheel having fun, fun, fun

10:34.462 --> 10:36.696
till my daddy in Heaven
takes my ragtop away.

10:36.757 --> 10:38.223
Car better be fast,

10:38.337 --> 10:39.603
whole parish will be chasing after you

10:39.667 --> 10:41.567
with fondue forks.

10:41.669 --> 10:44.276
Let's do this. Mama is ready to play.

10:44.347 --> 10:45.769
Sure, you'll call yourself mama now

10:45.816 --> 10:47.615
but not when I ask you to.

10:49.519 --> 10:50.552
You're betting all of it?

10:50.654 --> 10:52.420
Scared money don't win.

10:52.489 --> 10:53.788
Let's hope this goes better than Reno.

10:53.857 --> 10:55.657
- What?
- Nothing.

10:55.725 --> 10:57.926
19! Outta sight!

10:58.028 --> 10:59.360
Dealer has blackjack.

10:59.429 --> 11:01.763
Ah! Let's hit the fondue, Mama.

11:01.865 --> 11:03.565
Tell the girl I want a Sea Breeze.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.433
I'll be right back.

11:05.535 --> 11:07.802
Pretty good haul so far
for the oldsters.

11:07.871 --> 11:08.937
Who knew you could make a buck

11:09.005 --> 11:10.672
by preying on the weaknesses
of foolish people.

11:10.774 --> 11:12.273
Everybody, Mike.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.375
Everybody with a house nicer than ours.

11:14.444 --> 11:16.244
I mean, Caesar built
a whole palace in Vegas

11:16.313 --> 11:17.445
based on that little "secret."

11:17.547 --> 11:18.580
$40, please.

11:18.648 --> 11:20.281
Wendi, you worked all summer
for that money.

11:20.383 --> 11:21.549
You sure you want to do this?

11:21.651 --> 11:22.917
Are we back in caveman times?

11:22.986 --> 11:25.186
Wendi is a liberated woman fully capable

11:25.288 --> 11:27.122
of making her own idiotic choices.

11:27.224 --> 11:29.691
Thank you, Mrs. Cleary.
Actually, make it a hundred.

11:32.863 --> 11:34.229
Hit me.

11:34.331 --> 11:35.130
Player busts.

11:35.232 --> 11:35.897
Hit me.

11:35.966 --> 11:36.931
Busts again.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.833
That's because this donkey took my four.

11:39.636 --> 11:40.568
Are you kidding me?!

11:40.637 --> 11:41.970
Really? Really?

11:42.072 --> 11:43.371
That's 21.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.874
- Great, why don't you kiss me?
- What?

11:45.942 --> 11:47.175
Oh, I like to be kissed
while I'm getting...

11:49.279 --> 11:50.778
Double down.

11:50.881 --> 11:53.081
Are you trying to lose?
The dealer's showing an ace.

11:53.150 --> 11:55.049
- Let's get some fresh air.
- Get your hands off me.

11:55.118 --> 11:57.886
Security! And where is
my damn Sea Breeze?

11:57.988 --> 11:59.521
Stop bothering the money.

11:59.589 --> 12:02.056
Look, do I need to introduce you
to the boys in the back?

12:02.125 --> 12:03.424
I've never seen her like this, Mom.

12:03.527 --> 12:04.492
She's got the fever.

12:04.561 --> 12:05.927
Let's hope it turns into pneumonia,

12:05.996 --> 12:07.896
and she coughs up even more
to support the cause.

12:07.964 --> 12:10.765
Keep spending, everybody!
It's for the seniors!

12:10.834 --> 12:13.401
They're a treasure
that we love and then bury.

12:13.503 --> 12:16.204
Ha ha ha. You love senior citizens?

12:16.306 --> 12:17.338
If I didn't know better,

12:17.407 --> 12:18.606
I would think that I was in the presence

12:18.708 --> 12:19.908
of the great Phyllis Diller.

12:20.010 --> 12:21.376
I know we have a secret aunt

12:21.478 --> 12:22.911
and that you're shutting her
away from us

12:23.013 --> 12:23.745
in St. Agnes'.

12:23.847 --> 12:25.046
We have a secret aunt?

12:25.148 --> 12:26.414
You've got bigger stuff to worry about.

12:26.516 --> 12:28.216
Your girlfriend's over there
blowing her college fund.

12:28.318 --> 12:29.784
Go see if she needs more chips.

12:29.886 --> 12:33.788
Why have we never visited
this revered family-member

12:33.857 --> 12:35.557
or invited her over for Christmas?

12:35.659 --> 12:37.792
Why? To stick her in the corner
and string lights on her?

12:37.861 --> 12:39.761
My aunt has no idea who you are, Frank,

12:39.829 --> 12:40.962
and I envy her.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.331
How could you treat
a family member like this?

12:43.433 --> 12:45.733
Here she is

12:45.835 --> 12:49.103
as a beautiful young girl
with hopes and dreams,

12:49.172 --> 12:51.606
sitting on the horse she ate.

12:51.708 --> 12:53.341
After this hand,

12:53.410 --> 12:54.742
I'm driving you to get some help.

12:54.844 --> 12:56.010
But first, we'll stop at a pawn shop

12:56.112 --> 12:57.412
and see what we can get for these.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.113
Player has blackjack!

12:59.216 --> 13:00.648
- Oh, my God, I won!
- Cool!

13:00.717 --> 13:02.483
Let's celebrate at a place
that's not here!

13:02.552 --> 13:04.118
Not a chance. I'm on a roll.

13:04.187 --> 13:07.121
- Wendi, one hand...
- I'm on. A roll!

13:07.146 --> 13:07.999
Winner.

13:08.024 --> 13:09.290
- Yes!
- Yes!

13:09.359 --> 13:10.892
- Player wins!
- Yes, yes, yes!

13:10.994 --> 13:12.660
- Player has blackjack!
- Whoo!

13:12.685 --> 13:13.772
Dealer busts.

13:13.797 --> 13:14.963
- Eee!
- Aah!

13:15.031 --> 13:17.298
What in holy heck? She's winning?

13:17.400 --> 13:19.867
We need that money!

13:19.970 --> 13:22.036
Double down.

13:22.138 --> 13:24.472
She's got a lot of cheddar on the table.

13:24.574 --> 13:26.507
I knew it. Someone spilled the fondue.

13:26.610 --> 13:27.809
Dealer busts.

13:27.911 --> 13:28.876
You won!

13:28.979 --> 13:30.645
- No, no, no!
- Baby, you won!

13:30.747 --> 13:33.414
Ah, well... that was a rush.

13:33.483 --> 13:34.682
I'd like to cash out, please.

13:34.751 --> 13:37.585
No! Keep playing! Risk it all!

13:37.687 --> 13:39.287
A good gambler knows when to quit.

13:39.389 --> 13:41.089
<i>Wendi's run of luck was great for her</i>

13:41.191 --> 13:44.025
<i>but not so great for St. Agnes'.</i>

13:44.127 --> 13:46.227
All right.

13:46.296 --> 13:47.862
Try and give it a rev, Rev.

13:52.269 --> 13:53.968
When it makes that
"di-di-di-di-di" sound,

13:54.070 --> 13:57.171
that's Bonneville language
for "get a bus pass, Abdi."

13:59.175 --> 14:00.275
Sorry to intrude.

14:00.377 --> 14:02.243
I couldn't help but notice
from my window

14:02.312 --> 14:04.846
that you're, uh, wrestling
with old Bonnie here.

14:04.914 --> 14:06.314
Now that I know she has a name,

14:06.383 --> 14:08.082
I'm going to feel bad
when I push her off a cliff.

14:08.184 --> 14:09.484
Want to have a look, Mr. Dunne?

14:09.586 --> 14:11.019
I know a few tricks...

14:11.087 --> 14:13.288
ought to get this old girl humming.

14:13.356 --> 14:15.857
Just like I do with my new wife.

14:15.959 --> 14:17.659
You've made it very clear
you've been getting some.

14:17.761 --> 14:19.093
Try it now.

14:19.195 --> 14:21.663
Sometimes the choke plate gets stuck.

14:21.731 --> 14:23.898
Hmm.

14:23.967 --> 14:25.533
That did work.

14:25.635 --> 14:26.968
Thank you very much, Cecil.

14:27.070 --> 14:29.637
You're welcome, Bootaan.
It feels good to be helpful.

14:29.706 --> 14:31.773
It is easy to dismiss
an old car like this

14:31.841 --> 14:33.541
because it has traveled many miles

14:33.643 --> 14:35.943
and doesn't run as smoothly
as it used to.

14:36.046 --> 14:38.246
But it still has much to offer.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.915
Are you out of your mind?
This is a piece of junk.

14:41.017 --> 14:42.617
I was being metaphorical.

14:42.719 --> 14:45.586
Forget it, you're a
very frustrating man.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.201
- Raffle winner coming through!
- Oh!

14:50.279 --> 14:52.660
What's funny is,
I only bought one ticket.

14:52.762 --> 14:55.163
Mm, then that makes my story
200 times funnier.

14:59.393 --> 15:01.267
I just saw Dad pull up with Aunt Tess.

15:01.361 --> 15:04.289
Oh, and here comes the reason
she's moving in with us.

15:04.352 --> 15:06.085
I won fair and square, Mrs. Cleary.

15:06.141 --> 15:07.687
I'm not going to apologize about this.

15:07.727 --> 15:08.735
No, you shouldn't.

15:08.789 --> 15:10.079
I mean, those folks at St. Agnes'

15:10.124 --> 15:11.424
worked hard their whole lives

15:11.492 --> 15:14.119
so they could live out
their golden years with dignity.

15:14.197 --> 15:15.494
But then Wendi split tens.

15:15.563 --> 15:16.996
I know! It's nuts!

15:17.065 --> 15:19.198
Plus she won that boss car,
and I get to ride shotgun.

15:19.267 --> 15:22.134
Oh, did it come with a shotgun?
'Cause I'd like to borrow it.

15:22.203 --> 15:23.936
We're home!

15:24.005 --> 15:27.373
Welcome home, Aunt Tess.
You're a stranger.

15:27.475 --> 15:30.042
Get him off me!

15:30.144 --> 15:31.444
I'm allergic to cats.

15:31.546 --> 15:33.346
Let's, uh, show you your room.

15:33.414 --> 15:35.314
She smells like that wet chair
in the garage.

15:35.383 --> 15:36.749
I like it!

15:36.851 --> 15:38.784
Meow!

15:38.853 --> 15:40.453
Match made in heaven.

15:45.059 --> 15:47.026
Lot of crazy stuff in here.

15:47.095 --> 15:49.762
Look, if these are in her bag,
what's in her mouth?

15:49.831 --> 15:51.063
I vote we don't find out.

15:51.132 --> 15:53.032
Where are we supposed to sleep tonight?

15:53.134 --> 15:54.867
I call sleeping with Aunt Tess!

15:54.936 --> 15:56.669
She's got all these weird tinctures

15:56.771 --> 15:58.738
and unctions and ointments.

15:58.806 --> 16:00.339
This one is literally
called "snake oil."

16:00.408 --> 16:03.542
We can use that to catch Greg!
That's the snake's name now.

16:03.645 --> 16:07.446
Or... we can use this.

16:07.515 --> 16:09.782
We got Ol' Tess set up
in William and Pat's bed.

16:09.884 --> 16:11.717
Seems pretty comfortable
for someone who moans

16:11.786 --> 16:13.986
like a broken radiator when
you move any part of her body.

16:14.055 --> 16:15.821
Oh, maybe I should go check on her.

16:15.923 --> 16:18.190
I think that would be
the caring thing to do, Mother.

16:18.259 --> 16:20.960
I've got an old shower curtain
I need to shimmy under her.

16:24.332 --> 16:26.999
Dad, I am extremely disappointed in Mom.

16:27.068 --> 16:29.802
Well, as much as I enjoy
dinner and a show,

16:29.871 --> 16:31.437
I suggest you keep that to yourself.

16:31.539 --> 16:33.005
I'm sorry, but shunting Aunt Tess

16:33.107 --> 16:34.407
aside like that was heartless.

16:34.475 --> 16:35.741
How would you like it
if we just dumped you

16:35.843 --> 16:37.343
into some nursing home when you get old?

16:37.412 --> 16:39.445
Frank, I'm eating gravy
with a pizza crust.

16:39.547 --> 16:40.846
I'm not planning on getting old.

16:40.915 --> 16:43.182
You have to realize,
when she was growing up,

16:43.251 --> 16:45.918
your mom's mom was mean
and flinty as hell.

16:45.987 --> 16:48.020
It wasn't all moonbeams
and bedtime stories

16:48.122 --> 16:49.255
like it is for you kids.

16:49.323 --> 16:51.190
- What's a bedtime story?
- That's not important.

16:51.292 --> 16:53.292
But as tough as your grandma could be,

16:53.361 --> 16:55.494
Aunt Tess was a real friend to your mom.

16:55.530 --> 16:57.296
She's the one who taught her how to sew

16:57.398 --> 16:59.365
and ride a bike.

16:59.434 --> 17:02.168
When Peggy went to her first formal,

17:02.270 --> 17:04.103
Aunt Tess bought her shoes.

17:04.204 --> 17:05.838
So you have to appreciate how hard it is

17:05.906 --> 17:08.941
for your mom to be around Tess.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.743
Especially how she is now.

17:11.813 --> 17:15.681
Your mom isn't heartless,
she's heartbroken.

17:17.551 --> 17:19.285
Snake charming isn't a real thing.

17:19.387 --> 17:20.920
There's a lot of research to support it

17:21.021 --> 17:22.288
as a way to hypnotize snakes.

17:22.390 --> 17:23.989
Is that research mostly cartoons?

17:24.092 --> 17:25.424
There was also a "Three Stooges."

17:25.526 --> 17:28.728
Enough gabbing.
Greg's eating a light bulb.

17:36.304 --> 17:37.837
It's not working.

17:37.939 --> 17:39.371
Try a different key?

17:39.440 --> 17:41.062
At this point in the movie, I believe

17:41.109 --> 17:43.209
Moe hit Shemp in the head with a shovel.

17:43.277 --> 17:45.077
Let's try the key change first.

17:47.281 --> 17:49.348
Ask Leroy to wake me when the twins

17:49.450 --> 17:51.250
arrive with my yarn, would you?

17:51.352 --> 17:55.254
Thank you.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.460
Hm.

18:01.529 --> 18:04.196
She was always the smartest
of the Dempsey sisters.

18:04.265 --> 18:06.866
She could rattle off world capitals...

18:06.968 --> 18:09.001
Norway: Oslo,

18:09.103 --> 18:11.570
Liechtenstein: I forget.

18:12.740 --> 18:15.174
Places she'd never visit,

18:15.276 --> 18:17.443
except in her books.

18:20.581 --> 18:22.381
It's just not fair.

18:25.620 --> 18:28.420
It's the hand she's dealt.

18:29.557 --> 18:31.334
And we're dealt now, I guess.

18:31.359 --> 18:33.748
Let's steer clear
of the blackjack expressions

18:33.773 --> 18:34.860
for a while, hmm?

18:34.896 --> 18:36.896
Grab her another blanket?

18:36.931 --> 18:39.565
I don't want her to be chilly.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.634
Santiago!

18:41.669 --> 18:43.536
What's that, Aunt Tess?

18:43.571 --> 18:45.671
Chile.

18:45.706 --> 18:48.440
Capital of Chile...

18:48.476 --> 18:50.209
Santiago.

18:56.217 --> 18:57.983
It's still not having any effect.

18:58.052 --> 19:00.820
Yes, it is.

19:00.888 --> 19:04.657
I have an idea.

19:10.364 --> 19:12.698
Huh, it's working.

19:12.767 --> 19:15.067
Greg is a fan of ragtime.
Timmy, grab him.

19:15.169 --> 19:16.902
Uh, i-if he bites me,
suck out the venom.

19:17.004 --> 19:17.970
You got it, buddy.

19:18.072 --> 19:19.471
Thanks.

19:23.277 --> 19:26.212
So much drier than you'd expect.

19:29.717 --> 19:31.419
Come on. You know the rules.

19:31.477 --> 19:32.817
If you can't get it done in two minutes,

19:32.841 --> 19:34.258
go to the gas station.

19:34.283 --> 19:36.118
- Is that you, Frank?
- No.

19:36.196 --> 19:37.774
I think it's Aunt Tess in there.

19:37.811 --> 19:39.677
You know, I like what
you were saying before

19:39.779 --> 19:42.076
about multiple generations
living under one roof.

19:42.146 --> 19:43.748
Yeah. Sometimes I just say things.

19:43.842 --> 19:46.217
Great Aunt Tess,
is everything okay in there?

19:46.319 --> 19:48.352
It's not locked.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.922
Maybe someone should check on her?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.390
Be my guest.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.659
Like any of you are
a treat to walk in on.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.662
Aunt Tess, I'm coming in.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.864
Call an ambulance.

20:05.505 --> 20:09.106
Hello, Mrs. Peggy Cleary.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.942
I hear your aunt is recovering nicely.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.844
Now we just need to find a rest home

20:12.946 --> 20:16.314
or a nice cozy bus station
where we can drop her off.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.549
Or she can return to St. Agnes'.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.284
If you're taunting me,
it's lucky for you

20:20.386 --> 20:21.549
we're already in a hospital.

20:21.581 --> 20:23.087
I fear you too much, Mrs. Peggy Cleary,

20:23.189 --> 20:24.689
to ever test your patience.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.958
The church has come
into a hefty endowment

20:27.060 --> 20:28.793
from my friend Mrs. Greenblatt.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.995
The one with the stale cookies
and the chubby daughter?

20:31.097 --> 20:32.363
I thought I was delighting a nice lady

20:32.465 --> 20:34.565
with my uproarious water buffalo jokes,

20:34.667 --> 20:35.967
but it turns out...

20:36.069 --> 20:38.436
I was "schmoozing."

20:42.408 --> 20:44.141
Well...

20:44.244 --> 20:46.310
Did you hear that, Tess?

20:46.412 --> 20:50.414
You're gonna be going back
to your old bed at St. Agnes'.

20:50.516 --> 20:53.517
But maybe you should take
the shower curtain.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.819
And Pat.
