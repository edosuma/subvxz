WEBVTT

00:05.667 --> 00:07.000
ALL: Vive la France!

00:07.000 --> 00:09.133
You've bought into
your own lie,
Monsieur Sabine,

00:09.133 --> 00:11.900
and that's what's
so chilling.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.467
Let him look.

00:13.467 --> 00:16.000
He's not gonna find anything,
is he?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.700
Rossi was right. What was he
doing during the war?

00:19.700 --> 00:21.067
Why did he stay in Paris?

00:21.067 --> 00:23.133
If this guy was playing you,
why have you stuck around?

00:23.133 --> 00:26.800
Monsieur Sabine
kept us from going to a place
where nobody came back.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.867
My mother makes this herself.
Heals your hands.

00:30.867 --> 00:34.133
Those months I went away,
I was having a baby.

00:35.467 --> 00:37.533
Your baby is in Paris, Nina.

00:37.533 --> 00:40.467
The couple
who adopted him live in
the 8th Arrondissement.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.833
How do you know my husband?

00:42.833 --> 00:45.433
-He knows all about us.
-What did you tell him?

00:45.433 --> 00:48.000
I just wanted to let you know
it was taken care of.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.967
I don't need to know
any more about it, Victor.
Neither does Paul.

00:51.967 --> 00:55.300
I'd like to offer you
a financial stake
in the business.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.267
I have my own plan.

00:57.267 --> 01:01.800
How long are you willing
to live in his shadow?
You must want something more.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.632
-What did she offer you?
-A label that needs
resuscitating.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.167
I wonder if you could spare
me a few minutes tomorrow.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.900
-What's this regarding?
- It'll be easier to 
 explain

01:09.900 --> 01:11.333
once I'm there, monsieur.

01:12.767 --> 01:15.300
* I love Paris

01:15.300 --> 01:18.100
* In the springtime

01:19.533 --> 01:25.767
* I love Paris in the fall

01:25.767 --> 01:31.667
* I love Paris in the winter
when it drizzles *

01:31.667 --> 01:37.000
* Say, I love Paris in
the summer when it sizzles *

01:37.000 --> 01:39.367
* I love Paris

01:39.367 --> 01:43.167
* Why, oh, why
do I love Paris? *

01:43.167 --> 01:47.533
* Because my love is near

(POUNDING ON DOOR)

01:59.633 --> 02:02.367
Claude, please.

02:02.367 --> 02:04.933
Claude, won't you please
let me in?

02:04.933 --> 02:07.100
-Claude?
-(POUNDING)

02:08.767 --> 02:11.000
-Fuck! Ow!
-(SCREECHES)

02:11.000 --> 02:12.533
-Claude?
-Argh!

02:12.533 --> 02:14.633
-What just happened?
-Fuck!

02:14.633 --> 02:17.000
Claude, have you hurt
yourself? Are you bleeding?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.967
-Argh!
-Do you need my help?

02:18.967 --> 02:21.200
Please, let me come in.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.233
Please, I won't disturb you.

02:23.233 --> 02:25.000
I won't even breathe on you.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.767
Oh, open this goddamn door,
Claude!

02:27.767 --> 02:30.100
-Say something!
-Go away!

02:30.100 --> 02:32.600
Why? So you can suffer alone?

02:32.600 --> 02:33.833
(HE GROANS)

02:33.833 --> 02:36.133
That woman will drag you
straight into the river.

02:36.133 --> 02:38.767
You mark my words.
It's in the cards, Claude.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.567
She's doomed.

02:40.567 --> 02:42.833
I'm well aware of
Charlotte's intentions.

02:42.833 --> 02:45.433
Did you know she asked me to
invest in her new business?

02:45.433 --> 02:47.200
-I'm not surprised.
-You might be

02:47.200 --> 02:49.167
when some of your loyal
clients start opening
their chequebooks.

02:49.167 --> 02:50.933
I tried to talk some sense
into her.

02:50.933 --> 02:52.967
She can't just walk away
from this house.

02:52.967 --> 02:54.567
Marjorie...

02:54.567 --> 02:57.400
let someone zip you up
before you catch a cold.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.767
OK.

02:58.767 --> 03:00.500
I love your wife,

03:00.500 --> 03:04.300
and she would carve out
my voice box for saying this,

03:04.300 --> 03:07.033
but you need this girl.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.400
I have ballet sketches
to finish.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.467
And a party, here,
tomorrow night,

03:13.467 --> 03:15.700
which you're co-hosting,
in a luminous gown

03:15.700 --> 03:18.133
that will make every man here
want to undress you,

03:18.133 --> 03:20.033
even more than this.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.600
It's business as usual,
my dear.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.233
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Inspector.

03:31.233 --> 03:34.367
Were you able to locate
your original sketches
for the dress?

03:34.367 --> 03:37.733
I wasn't. So many of them
are done on scraps,

03:37.733 --> 03:39.200
stuffed into my pockets.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.533
They rarely survive
their trip to the cleaners.

03:41.533 --> 03:45.067
But this is
an interesting coincidence.

03:48.267 --> 03:51.467
How long do you expect
to be in Paris?

03:51.467 --> 03:54.333
Oh, as long as I have to be.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.000
I'm in no rush.

INSPECTOR BOMPARD:
From the research I've done,
this particular design,

04:25.333 --> 04:28.633
it's a common choice
for men in the military.

04:28.633 --> 04:30.500
Navy, to be exact.

04:30.500 --> 04:34.333
So, now you think
the victim was French?

04:34.333 --> 04:37.233
Last time you were here,
you were sure
he was a German.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.167
Never sure.

04:39.167 --> 04:42.067
Only an educated guess.
But you know how it is.

04:42.067 --> 04:43.333
You follow one horse,

04:43.333 --> 04:46.733
until a faster one
sneaks around the bend.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.900
Tell me, Monsieur Sabine,

04:49.900 --> 04:54.033
are any of your workers
married or related to
sailors?

04:54.033 --> 04:57.933
-If you're intent on
questioning my staff...
-Oh, no, not there yet.

04:57.933 --> 05:00.033
Just trying
to connect the dots.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.900
I'm curious if someone
with this tattoo

05:02.900 --> 05:06.933
passed through your shop
and possibly inspired
the design?

05:06.933 --> 05:09.900
Unconsciously, of course.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.833
Well, I can't account for
what fires my imagination,
Inspector,

05:12.833 --> 05:17.367
but I can assure you
it's not men in the military.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.400
(CHUCKLES) Naturally.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.000
Who wants to see
Rita Hayworth
in a sailor suit...

05:22.000 --> 05:24.167
besides me?

05:25.633 --> 05:27.800
It's a bit odd, though,
isn't it?

05:27.800 --> 05:31.467
This particular image
surfacing on your dress

05:31.467 --> 05:34.433
and on the victim
on your property.

05:34.433 --> 05:39.100
(EXHALES)
It's a... It's a coincidence.

05:39.100 --> 05:43.300
But then so is the fact that
you and I are both wearing
chocolate brown socks.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.167
Stranger things
have happened.

05:50.233 --> 05:53.433
Has anyone asked
about why Charlotte left?

05:53.433 --> 05:57.467
There's so much work,
most of the girls are just
trying to stay above water.

05:58.767 --> 06:00.667
And has the mood changed?

06:00.667 --> 06:02.733
Do they view Paul
differently?

06:03.867 --> 06:05.900
They probably feel sorry
for him.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.167
It's a betrayal, isn't it?

06:08.167 --> 06:12.067
To walk out after he's
invested so much time
training you.

06:13.967 --> 06:16.067
Has anyone asked
about Claude?

06:17.133 --> 06:20.367
No. Have you spoken to him?

06:22.233 --> 06:25.967
No. We've been so busy.

06:25.967 --> 06:30.000
Paul bouncing from interviews
to the hospital
to see Dominique.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.433
He's barely had a minute
to work on
the ballet sketches.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.967
I was hoping
he might come to you.

06:37.967 --> 06:40.367
-Me?
-To ask for help.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.433
But I'm not a designer.

06:46.433 --> 06:48.667
But you two have
worked together for so long,

06:48.667 --> 06:52.367
you know his tastes and...
the fabrics he loves.

06:52.367 --> 06:54.400
But it's not the same, is it?

06:54.400 --> 06:57.600
You wouldn't ask a violinist
to compose a concerto.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.333
No.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.500
No, you wouldn't, would you?

07:06.100 --> 07:08.600
There is somebody
who could be useful.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.967
Maybe I could mention it
to her.

07:11.967 --> 07:13.733
Yes, please.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.567
It'll only be
to colour in the lines.

07:20.100 --> 07:23.433
Here. Sit.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.233
-I don't want to sit.
-All right, stand.

07:25.233 --> 07:28.400
Pace, use my bed if you want,
I haven't seen it
since Monday.

07:29.233 --> 07:30.733
What's this for?

07:30.733 --> 07:35.000
Charlotte is bringing
Regine Deleurs here tomorrow.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.767
She's promised her
three outfits.

07:36.767 --> 07:40.400
-You can't do three outfits.
-You can if you skip
sleep and meals.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.967
-Why are you doing this?
-Why?

07:44.967 --> 07:47.900
Well, cos we need this editor
to get us out the gate.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.067
It's our one chance before
she leaves for New York.

07:50.067 --> 07:52.400
I finally tell you
the reason I went away,

07:52.400 --> 07:56.200
you tell me you want to help,
but then you're gone.

07:56.200 --> 08:03.133
-Nina...
-Your office is cleaned out,
empty. No note. No goodbye.

08:03.133 --> 08:04.467
Why would I say goodbye?

08:04.467 --> 08:07.633
Is this so you wouldn't
have to see me again?

08:09.433 --> 08:13.233
So you could pretend
I didn't tell you the truth?

08:13.233 --> 08:15.767
Nina, I'm not jumping ship.

08:15.767 --> 08:17.667
This is me getting on board.

08:17.667 --> 08:23.000
This is me sailing
into strange, fucking
unchartered waters

08:23.000 --> 08:25.967
where I need to take care of
more than just my cat.

08:25.967 --> 08:28.000
And it's a little new for me.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.067
So...just spare me the rod.

08:32.067 --> 08:33.767
At least until I find...

08:35.767 --> 08:37.067
Found it.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.100
Open it.

09:05.933 --> 09:08.400
I mean, you don't have to...

09:08.400 --> 09:11.300
you don't have to slip it on
just yet.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.400
At least not until we're
ready to tell the world.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.267
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-Yep?

09:33.233 --> 09:36.267
-Am I disturbing you?
-No. No, not at all.

09:36.267 --> 09:39.467
I'm finally getting a chance
to print some
from the lost rolls.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.733
That was a wonderful moment.

09:43.433 --> 09:46.133
Holding her hand while
she was wearing that dress.

09:47.567 --> 09:50.633
I felt like a proud father,
giving her away.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.933
Oh, there's one of
both of you I could just...

09:52.933 --> 09:55.333
Later. Later, perhaps.
I er...

09:55.333 --> 09:59.933
I have a job for you...
but it's not for the house.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.667
But it's for me.
It's a favour.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.433
Yeah.

10:13.333 --> 10:16.400
I'm being investigated
by the police.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.167
Has this got something to do
with Rossi?

10:21.100 --> 10:22.833
No, I don't believe so.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.600
Er...well, I don't want to
get into specifics,

10:25.600 --> 10:29.233
but I do believe
I'm being framed.

10:29.233 --> 10:30.800
Possibly by
the same saboteur

10:30.800 --> 10:33.067
who passed that note
to your colleague.

10:33.067 --> 10:37.500
He's not a colleague.
He was an operator who was
pulling my strings, too.

10:39.067 --> 10:41.300
What is it you want me to do?

10:42.600 --> 10:45.467
Victor took these,
last winter at my cottage,

10:45.467 --> 10:47.333
the first day
we looked at it.

10:47.333 --> 10:51.167
I'd like you to move us
to this area by the barn,

10:51.167 --> 10:54.400
and then take these rocks
and put them here.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.533
Can that be done?

10:58.533 --> 10:59.733
I...

11:01.167 --> 11:02.600
Well, I...

11:05.267 --> 11:08.233
I'd have to print one
negative on top of the other,

11:08.233 --> 11:11.200
dodge and burn
to prevent double exposure.

11:14.433 --> 11:17.367
It might take a few tries,
but yeah,

11:17.367 --> 11:19.667
sure, it can be done.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.433
Thank you.

11:41.533 --> 11:42.767
(DOOR CLOSES)

12:01.300 --> 12:04.133
Maybe we'll see some friends
at the park, hm?

12:04.133 --> 12:06.033
Come on, darling.

12:06.033 --> 12:07.700
Enjoy the park.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.633
We'll only be an hour.

12:11.833 --> 12:14.167
-Bye. See you later.
-(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

12:32.267 --> 12:34.933
Paul, if that detective
starts asking Claude...

12:34.933 --> 12:38.233
-This is not the black
I ordered.
-Black is black.

12:38.233 --> 12:41.200
No, not when you're being
dragged into hell
by a hoard of demons!

12:41.200 --> 12:44.100
I need a Spanish black!
This is Don Juan, damn it!

12:44.100 --> 12:45.833
I don't even know
what that means.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.233
It's Dance of the Furies.

12:47.233 --> 12:50.833
I need something so dark
it hits you across the face.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.800
What don't you understand?

12:52.800 --> 12:57.433
Focusing on a tutu
when this office still smells
like a detective.

12:57.433 --> 12:59.333
-We need a plan.
-I have a plan.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.033
I'm telling Claude the truth.

13:02.033 --> 13:04.433
-Paul, you can't.
-We have to.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.267
That sailor keeps
popping out of the ground.

13:09.267 --> 13:11.167
Should he learn the truth
from us

13:11.167 --> 13:13.133
or a stranger
in a police office?

13:13.133 --> 13:15.400
Dragging in Victor
wasn't enough,

13:15.400 --> 13:17.567
now I've pulled in Billy
as well.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.733
Will you let me tell him?

13:23.733 --> 13:25.733
Please.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.067
He needs to hear this
from me.

13:35.767 --> 13:39.333
I can't really tell how
it moves until it's moving.

13:40.533 --> 13:43.167
I'll adjust the hips
once Flor has it on.

13:44.167 --> 13:45.600
Flor won't be here.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.900
She has to be here,
these are her measurements.

I made a terrible mistake
at Monsieur Trouvier's
chateau.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.433
I was only hoping
to protect Paul's marriage,

17:55.433 --> 17:59.300
but apparently saving one son
cost me the other.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.200
I really must go.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.300

30:32.400 --> 30:35.367
that the dress
should adapt to the body

30:35.367 --> 30:38.633
rather than the body always
having to adapt to the dress.

30:41.733 --> 30:44.033
I mean, just because
you're wearing couture,

30:44.033 --> 30:48.433
it doesn't mean you shouldn't
be able to break a little
wind when you need to.

30:49.800 --> 30:50.833
Right? (CHUCKLES)

30:50.833 --> 30:53.633
I mean, that's freedom.
Right?

31:15.200 --> 31:17.333
Monsieur?

31:18.933 --> 31:23.800
-Why are you in that?
-It's for the party tonight.

31:23.800 --> 31:27.200
I told your mother I wanted
you in the teal cocotte.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.033
Dominique wore it
in the show.

31:29.033 --> 31:31.567
Um...we don't have time
to alter it.

31:31.567 --> 31:35.367
Why not?
You were supposed to come in
for a fitting yesterday.

31:35.367 --> 31:37.700
I wasn't able to make it.

31:37.700 --> 31:39.333
Were you with Claude?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.433
Yes.

31:46.867 --> 31:49.433
Tell your mother to pair it
with the cabochons set.

31:49.433 --> 31:52.433
She'll know what
I'm talking about.

31:56.233 --> 31:57.567
Monsieur...

32:03.733 --> 32:06.167
If I were no longer here
as a model...

32:09.267 --> 32:11.433
..would I still be welcome?

32:13.967 --> 32:15.633
Ah.

32:17.733 --> 32:21.067
So Charlotte's taught Claude
the art of poaching.

32:21.067 --> 32:22.967
He's asked you
to model for him.

32:22.967 --> 32:25.700
No. That's not what I meant.

32:27.667 --> 32:29.633
I was there to...

32:32.233 --> 32:36.300
Er... I helped him because
he was overwhelmed.

32:36.300 --> 32:40.267
-He needed...
-Nina, stop cowering.

32:40.267 --> 32:43.600
You're not a naughty child
who stole a lollipop
so don't act like one.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.700
You know
how fond I am of you,

32:45.700 --> 32:48.533
but you have some nerve
to betray me

32:48.533 --> 32:51.567
and then ask me
to make it easier for you.

32:56.200 --> 32:59.300
(SNIFFS) Monsieur, please.

33:02.133 --> 33:03.767
I owe you my life.

33:06.333 --> 33:08.500
Yet you still chose
my brother.

33:25.767 --> 33:28.700
Just five more minutes.
Take the sketches with you.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.267
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

33:33.300 --> 33:36.200
-Ah, look who's here.
PAUL: Regine.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.433
How lovely to see you.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.767
Even if you're wearing
something that's not mine.

33:40.767 --> 33:43.633
REGINE: (CHUCKLES) I must go.

33:43.633 --> 33:46.967
Thank you so much.
You have a charming home.

33:46.967 --> 33:49.733
It's all very exciting.

33:53.433 --> 33:56.567
Regine, when do you return
from New York?

33:56.567 --> 34:00.167
I've seen enough, my dear.
You are definitely
on your way.

34:01.133 --> 34:02.867
It certainly has
a point of view.

34:02.867 --> 34:06.867
But let's be honest,
he is not his brother.

34:06.867 --> 34:10.467
Paul has a gift for making
anyone from anywhere
look like a lady.

34:10.467 --> 34:13.533
This one? I'm not so sure.

34:16.933 --> 34:19.467
So our next appointment
is at...

34:30.367 --> 34:31.600
(KNOCKS)

34:33.433 --> 34:35.433
-Inspector Bompard?
-Yes.

34:35.433 --> 34:37.900
The detective downstairs,
he sent me to you.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.266
-He said you could help.
-Did he?

34:40.266 --> 34:43.766
My husband's been gone
for three months.

34:43.766 --> 34:47.933
He's in the navy,
based in Cherbourg.

34:47.933 --> 34:51.433
His shipmates said
he might have run off
with someone else.

34:53.167 --> 34:55.132
Today, I um...

34:56.400 --> 34:58.333
Go on.

35:04.767 --> 35:09.633
His wallet was left in a sack
in the café next door.

35:09.633 --> 35:13.300
It was left there
in the night,
hanging on a knob.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.400
Do you know this person?

35:34.700 --> 35:37.500
-Have you called this number?
-Yes, but there was
no answer.

35:40.333 --> 35:43.333
Is there anything else
you can share?

35:46.200 --> 35:47.667
There was a stranger

35:47.667 --> 35:50.733
who came by a while ago
looking for Marc.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.733
He wasn't a shipmate.

35:54.400 --> 35:58.333
If you and Charlotte
need time to talk,
I can come back.

35:59.867 --> 36:01.667
No, she left.

36:01.667 --> 36:04.933
Said what she needed to say,
and I don't need to be
stroked.

36:04.933 --> 36:07.967
I've got a cat for that.

36:07.967 --> 36:11.167
Regine Deleurs
can't sell these dresses,
Claude, but I can.

36:11.167 --> 36:12.967
No one asked you to.

36:12.967 --> 36:16.400
You are two collections
ahead of everybody else in
this town.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.100
And they'll never catch up
with you, none of us can.

36:19.100 --> 36:20.967
This is brilliant!

36:20.967 --> 36:23.667
Did... Did Maman send you?

36:24.867 --> 36:28.267
No. Have you spoken to her?

36:28.267 --> 36:30.633
Er...no, only through a door.

36:30.633 --> 36:33.100
Actually, I might keep it
like that for a while.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.633
Maman's clueless.

36:34.633 --> 36:37.667
She thinks we're
bonded together
because we shared a bed

36:37.667 --> 36:39.200
and stolen cigarettes.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.167
The same fear of
never having enough.

36:41.167 --> 36:44.167
But that's not
what holds us together.

36:44.167 --> 36:46.167
No,
you left out a father too.

36:46.167 --> 36:48.733
Cos apparently
we share that as well.

36:48.733 --> 36:50.500
And until Maman
tells us differently,

36:50.500 --> 36:52.333
the same bastard
fell on her twice--

36:52.333 --> 36:54.000
-We've protected each other.
-Two times in five years.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.333
Where I'm weak, you're
strong. Where I'm strong...

36:56.333 --> 36:59.933
What the fuck
are you going on about?

36:59.933 --> 37:04.767
Is this all because some
pampered silly little bird
shat on my work?

37:04.767 --> 37:08.800
Cos I can handle that, Paul.

37:08.800 --> 37:12.500
I don't give a damn
what Regine Deleurs said!

37:12.500 --> 37:15.567
Exactly. You never have.
But I do!

37:15.567 --> 37:19.000
And that's why
we're better together.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.633
I'm not going backwards.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.400
I can't.

37:29.200 --> 37:34.367
Will it feel that way
if both of our names
are on the label?

37:40.867 --> 37:45.167
No. No, cos Helen's put
you up to this, hasn't she?

37:45.167 --> 37:46.800
-No.
-Did she threaten you?

37:46.800 --> 37:48.867
-Stop it.
-Turn around,
prove you don't have a key--

37:48.867 --> 37:51.633
-Fuck off, Claude.
-Cos it seems to me like
your wife might have --

37:51.633 --> 37:53.667
Helen has nothing
to do with this!

37:53.667 --> 37:55.800
What else do
you want me to say?

37:55.800 --> 37:58.567
I can't do what you can!

38:03.667 --> 38:05.600
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

38:22.433 --> 38:24.233
I'll have a document
drafted today

38:24.233 --> 38:27.333
that officially changes
the name of the house.

38:27.333 --> 38:29.500
It'll be on my desk
this evening.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.900
If you doubt me,
come by tonight.

38:33.900 --> 38:37.000
If you agree to the terms,
sign it.

38:38.767 --> 38:41.600
We can make
an announcement at the party.

38:47.933 --> 38:49.567
It's your call, Claude.

38:55.367 --> 39:01.133
* La musique tombait
comme la nuit... *

39:09.933 --> 39:12.333
Here you are. Have you eaten?

39:14.267 --> 39:16.767
I showed my sketches
to Monsieur's wife.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.800
She loved them.

39:19.800 --> 39:22.900
Said she's going to share
them with him later tonight.

39:22.900 --> 39:25.667
I thought we could celebrate.

39:25.667 --> 39:28.233
Don't you think
it's a little early
to celebrate?

39:29.800 --> 39:31.867
That wasn't
a very nice thing to say.

39:31.867 --> 39:34.967
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up

39:34.967 --> 39:37.500
and have them dashed.

39:39.067 --> 39:41.100
So you thought
you'd dash them yourself?

39:51.500 --> 39:54.267
Why is it so easy
for you to be cruel?

39:56.100 --> 40:00.000
Maybe I am...cruel.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.367
It's a relief, really,
to have you finally see it.

40:04.367 --> 40:06.767
It's been tiresome trying
to be something I'm not.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.067
-Billy.
-Oh, Jesus!

40:52.067 --> 40:54.267
You scared me.

40:54.267 --> 40:56.233
Everything OK?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.933
What's in the envelope?

40:58.933 --> 41:01.100
It's, er...

41:03.400 --> 41:05.000
It's for your husband.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.233
It's my letter
of resignation.

41:08.733 --> 41:11.100
You're leaving us, too?

41:13.200 --> 41:16.033
Just out of curiosity,

41:16.033 --> 41:18.933
what exactly
is Charlotte offering?

41:18.933 --> 41:23.100
I'm not staying here.
I'm going back to the Bronx.

41:23.100 --> 41:25.133
Why?

41:27.100 --> 41:29.067
I just have
too many questions.

41:29.067 --> 41:33.367
And no offence,
but your husband, he doesn't
really like to give answers.

41:35.167 --> 41:37.267
Maybe I can give answers.

41:40.333 --> 41:42.100
If I'm right about you...

41:43.267 --> 41:45.333
..then I don't think you can.

42:09.033 --> 42:11.067
Is Claude here?

42:19.433 --> 42:22.167
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

42:22.167 --> 42:25.400
But if you came all the way
here to lure him back
to the Maison,

42:25.400 --> 42:27.333
you've probably wasted
a metro fare.

42:27.333 --> 42:30.600
Why would I do that?
I've been helping him.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.467
I spent the morning sewing
that dress you're folding up.

42:33.467 --> 42:37.367
Well, then he's made a fool
of both of us.

42:37.367 --> 42:40.800
My fault. I should have never
left Claude alone with him.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.533
-With who?
-His brother,

42:42.533 --> 42:44.767
who'll convince you
that you can't walk

42:44.767 --> 42:47.167
even as you're
running away from him.

42:47.167 --> 42:50.500
Claude knows that.

42:50.500 --> 42:54.400
-He's ready to be on his own.
-Well, so am I.

43:06.767 --> 43:08.467
I'll get you some tape.

43:15.967 --> 43:20.933
It's a myth, you know...
that we're ruled
by our emotions.

43:20.933 --> 43:23.700
It's not true. Men are.

43:25.667 --> 43:29.467
They react without thinking,
then call it instinct.

43:36.100 --> 43:38.200
You can trust Claude.

43:41.100 --> 43:42.667
No.

43:44.700 --> 43:46.700
I can trust myself.

-How lovely to see you.

Good evening. I am
looking for Claude Sabine.

45:34.200 --> 45:36.367
Is he here?

45:44.933 --> 45:46.700
Claude.

Hello.

Um...I'm not here
to cause a scene or...

45:56.633 --> 46:00.400
..or rip dresses
off your guests or anything,

46:00.400 --> 46:03.267
I swear. They didn't even
see me come in.

46:03.267 --> 46:05.300
I don't doubt it.

46:05.300 --> 46:07.500
You have a gift
for disappearing.

46:21.033 --> 46:23.233
I'm sorry, Helen.

46:27.367 --> 46:31.000
She...threw me a life jacket.

46:33.967 --> 46:36.133
So why are you here?

46:37.933 --> 46:40.100
Um...

46:40.100 --> 46:42.367
My brother asked me
to come back.

46:44.200 --> 46:46.200
On different terms.

46:48.100 --> 46:49.433
I need him.

46:53.300 --> 46:55.533
I thought that would
make you smile.

46:57.267 --> 47:00.533
-A mistake.
-No, it's not a mistake.

47:03.200 --> 47:06.467
Paul is downstairs,
I'll tell him you're here.

47:11.767 --> 47:13.767
It was brave, though.

What you did.

Don't think it wasn't.

It's not exactly how I
expected to be leaving Paris.

I just hope
I'm not leaving alone.

with a lie.

about this guy.

you still doing here?

that needed to be put away.

We can do that tomorrow.

about the sketches?

48:46.800 --> 48:48.200
He hasn't seen them.

48:48.200 --> 48:49.733
And he won't.

48:49.733 --> 48:53.067
I'm going to ask Madame
not to share them with him.

48:53.067 --> 48:55.100
But why?

48:55.100 --> 48:57.033
This is your chance
to be noticed.

-For him to see what you --
-I don't want him to see.

-But you want to be
a designer.
-And when I was little,

49:02.167 --> 49:04.000
I wanted to be a mermaid.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.233
Should I hold out for that,
too?

49:07.233 --> 49:10.867
How can I design clothes
for balls and resorts

49:10.867 --> 49:12.967
when I've never
been to either?

-And never will.
-I don't understand.

He also gave you spirit.

49:34.667 --> 49:36.767
And imagination.

49:36.767 --> 49:38.767
And talent.

49:40.033 --> 49:42.333
It's your job to show it.

49:45.233 --> 49:47.467
What if he hates my drawings?

49:49.200 --> 49:52.167
Why reach just
to get slapped down?

49:54.667 --> 49:57.667
Because that's going to
happen whether you
reach or not.

50:17.967 --> 50:20.133
(MUSIC SWELLS)

50:34.600 --> 50:36.667
Do you know this story?

50:50.700 --> 50:52.733
Sorry. Excuse me.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.733
Charlotte, honey,
what a pleasant surprise.

50:56.733 --> 50:59.367
I'm not here for your party.
Where's Claude?

50:59.367 --> 51:02.167
Get rid of her.
I don't care how you do it,

51:02.167 --> 51:04.267
just don't let her
make a scene.

51:04.267 --> 51:06.633
CHARLOTTE: I want to see
Claude. Where is he?

51:06.633 --> 51:10.300
Would you come with me
where we can talk?
Please just come with me.

51:10.300 --> 51:12.700
PAUL: Is there anything
you want to change?

51:14.800 --> 51:16.233
Claude?

51:19.367 --> 51:21.167
Did I leave anything out?

51:21.167 --> 51:24.700
Look, I am trying to
broker peace between
you and his family,

51:24.700 --> 51:26.700
but, honey, this is not
the right time for --

51:26.700 --> 51:28.733
-Are they in his office?
-If you stomp in here

51:28.733 --> 51:31.067
like an angry Apache,
you're not helping
your cause.

51:31.067 --> 51:35.033
This is not a cause.
This is a business.

51:35.033 --> 51:38.267
Then why are you
using your dirty laundry
as window dressing?

52:19.200 --> 52:21.300
(PEN WRITING)

52:34.100 --> 52:37.567
We have some
unexpected guests.

52:37.567 --> 52:39.567
You may want to stay up here
for a bit.

52:39.567 --> 52:41.600
Who are
the unexpected guests?

52:41.600 --> 52:44.833
Inspector Bompard,
with a gendarme.

52:44.833 --> 52:46.867
Bompard?

52:46.867 --> 52:48.767
(SCOFFS)

52:48.767 --> 52:51.067
Why is he back in our lives?

52:59.300 --> 53:01.700
-Can I help you?
-Forgive our intrusion,

53:01.700 --> 53:04.067
but I'm looking for
Monsieur Sabine.

53:04.067 --> 53:06.667
-Is he here?
-I'm his wife.

53:06.667 --> 53:08.533
What is this regarding?

53:08.533 --> 53:10.533
We're here to make an arrest,
Madame.

53:10.533 --> 53:14.767
I gave you time.
I gave you time to tell him.

53:14.767 --> 53:18.033
-Tell me what?
-I used my time well.

53:18.033 --> 53:19.533
Claude will be fine.

53:19.533 --> 53:22.200
That detective left here
wanting answers
from all of us.

53:22.200 --> 53:25.100
-Answers about what?
-Keep your voices down.

53:25.100 --> 53:26.933
I've taken care of this.

53:26.933 --> 53:28.500
Like you took care
of a sailor?

53:28.500 --> 53:29.767
Paul!

53:34.000 --> 53:36.100
What the fuck
are you talking about?

53:36.100 --> 53:38.767
I told you
I took care of this.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.433
She had him killed.

53:41.433 --> 53:43.533
-What are you doing?
-That's who's buried
at the cottage.

53:43.533 --> 53:46.067
-Paul,
what are you trying to prove?
-She killed him

53:46.067 --> 53:48.133
because she thought
he was a threat.

53:48.133 --> 53:49.667
-Stop talking!
-He knew our secrets.

53:49.667 --> 53:52.600
-Paul!
-She still sees us as mice,

53:52.600 --> 53:54.867
and the sky
swirling with hawks.

53:54.867 --> 53:57.533
YVETTE: There's just you,
me and your brother.

53:57.533 --> 53:59.933
This family will not be hurt.

53:59.933 --> 54:02.667
Keep telling yourself that.
We weren't defending
ourselves!

54:02.667 --> 54:05.067
-We threw the first punch!
-Stop talking!

54:05.067 --> 54:08.500
We paid him to be a monster
and then punished him for it.

54:12.700 --> 54:14.700
You...

54:22.300 --> 54:25.767
You paid Marc to attack me?

54:27.633 --> 54:30.467
YVETTE: Claude, darling.

54:31.933 --> 54:33.833
You both did this?

54:33.833 --> 54:36.367
There's nothing for
you to worry about.

54:36.367 --> 54:39.500
That detective
is not here to see us.

54:39.500 --> 54:42.533
Well, then who?

54:42.533 --> 54:44.733
I don't understand.
I've never even heard of
this person.

54:44.733 --> 54:48.033
The telephone number
of your former madam
was in his wallet.

54:48.033 --> 54:49.733
You may not remember
your old clients,

54:49.733 --> 54:51.833
but this one went to
great lengths to find you.

54:51.833 --> 54:53.733
I don't know what
you're talking about.

54:53.733 --> 54:56.767
-I don't know this man.
-Then perhaps you can
explain to us

54:56.767 --> 55:02.533
why we found this...
in your apartment.

55:02.533 --> 55:06.133
-BOMPARD: His identity tag.
-CHARLOTTE: I swear I've
never heard of this person.

55:06.133 --> 55:07.700
BOMPARD: We needn't
discuss this here.

55:07.700 --> 55:09.033
CHARLOTTE:
Please, just let me...

55:09.033 --> 55:10.567
BOMPARD:
Please get in the car.

55:21.767 --> 55:24.033
You're safe.

55:27.267 --> 55:29.200
You left out a lot.

55:32.733 --> 55:34.500
Oh, Claude.

55:34.500 --> 55:36.433
(DOOR SLAMS)

55:37.233 --> 55:39.400
(CLOCK TICKING)

56:02.433 --> 56:03.600
Nina.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.100
Sorry.

56:16.967 --> 56:18.333
(BELL RINGS)

56:33.633 --> 56:35.100
Can I help you?

57:25.800 --> 57:27.267
Did you find your brother?

57:27.267 --> 57:29.500
I wouldn't know
where to look.

57:31.133 --> 57:33.300
(SNIFFLES)
Try that detective's office.

57:37.700 --> 57:39.733
If that's what
he wants to do...

57:41.167 --> 57:42.633
..let him.

57:42.633 --> 57:45.000
And what is that
supposed to mean?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.700
I'm finished cleaning up
after my mother.

57:49.833 --> 57:54.033
Was pinning it on Charlotte
your idea...or hers?

57:55.233 --> 57:57.533
We'll take up Marjorie's
offer, go to New York.

57:57.533 --> 58:00.433
Scout a location
for another atelier.

58:03.800 --> 58:08.533
This was left on the doorstep
last night, waiting for us.

58:23.533 --> 58:25.033
(SIGHS)

58:30.533 --> 58:33.400
I'll be staying with
my uncle.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.167
Helen, please.

58:44.933 --> 58:47.400
Let's go to New York.

58:47.400 --> 58:50.133
I'm not sure
who I'd be going with.
