10:00.458 --> 10:03.959
- Of course. What did you think
we were talking about?

10:03.959 --> 10:04.667
- Uh, nothing.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.917
- We thought you were gonna
get rid of us.

10:06.917 --> 10:07.917
Ooh...
- [laughs]

10:07.917 --> 10:08.959
- We would never do that.

10:08.959 --> 10:12.000
You''re the best ten things
that ever happened to us.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.999

10:18.458 --> 10:19.291
[high-pitch laugh]

10:19.291 --> 10:22.000
- Oof, Dad really should get
rid of that one.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.000
[crashes, toilet flushes]]
- Ah.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.500
Looks like everything''s back
to normal at the Loud house,

10:35.500 --> 10:37.417
and my eavesdropping days
are over.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.959
<i>- What do you mean

10:39.959 --> 10:41.917
