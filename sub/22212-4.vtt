00:08.258 --> 00:10.218
[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

00:10.301 --> 00:11.177
[gunshot]

00:11.261 --> 00:14.139
[Alice] He calls himself the Black Hood.
He wants us to publish this letter.

00:14.222 --> 00:16.266
[Keller]
"My wrath is the price of your lies."

00:16.349 --> 00:18.893
We sent it in
for tomorrow's front page.

00:18.977 --> 00:22.856
I'll protect you. Nothing like this
will happen to you again. I swear.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.649
-[grunts]
-Get off!

00:24.733 --> 00:26.317
It's me. Are you insane?

00:26.484 --> 00:30.363
Sometimes defending isn't enough.
You need to go on the offensive.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.658
We're the Red Circle.
We're coming for you. We'll find you.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.659
We will hunt you.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.119
And we will end you.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.960
[Jughead] Everyone's afraid to say it.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.795
So, let me be the first.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.840
There is a serial killer amongst us.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.342
San Francisco had the Zodiac.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.512
New Orleans had the Axeman.

00:55.346 --> 00:58.600
Texarkana, Texas,
had the Phantom Killer.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.478
The list goes on and on.

01:01.978 --> 01:05.065
Add to their ranks
Riverdale's very own psychopath,

01:05.440 --> 01:06.524
the Black Hood.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.075
-These research for school?
-Research.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.993
Not for school.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.039
It's terrible
what's going on in this town.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.710
Who would've thunk it?
A serial killer in Riverdale.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.421
I'm not just talking about him.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.508
I'm also talking about that awful video.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.134
There it was.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.054
Terror was seeping
into the bedrock of Riverdale.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.058
A town hall meeting
had been set by Mayor McCoy.

01:44.687 --> 01:47.106
People were afraid
to walk the streets alone,

01:47.190 --> 01:48.858
especially as dusk approached.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.489
Shops closed early,
locks were added to doors.

01:54.989 --> 01:58.409
Suspicions between
the North and South side deepened...

01:59.244 --> 02:01.621
fanned into flames by Alice Cooper.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.583
[glass shatters]

02:05.667 --> 02:07.043
[dogs barking]

02:08.419 --> 02:11.840
As everyone wondered
what danger lurked in the dark...

02:14.801 --> 02:17.595
when we would hear
from the Black Hood next...

02:22.559 --> 02:26.020
and how far into darkness
would Archie go

02:27.021 --> 02:28.690
on his quest to avenge his father...

02:29.566 --> 02:31.901
and to stop the Black Hood?

02:33.236 --> 02:34.070
[gunshot]

02:37.365 --> 02:40.243
To be honest,
I had no idea what Archie was thinking.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.203
He didn't say anything
about this video?

02:42.370 --> 02:44.581
-Am I my boyfriend's keeper?
-[speaks in Spanish]

02:44.664 --> 02:47.625
-This isn't something to joke about.
-It's a video.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.252
Yes. Threatening violence.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.255
Can you please tell Mom
she's overreacting?

02:53.923 --> 02:55.675
On this, I stand with your mother.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.553
Which means,
you are done dating Archie.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.473
This isn't Amish country, Mom.
I can date who I wanna date.

03:02.807 --> 03:07.228
And I'm not jumping to any conclusions
until I hear Archie's side of the story.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.695
What are you smiling about?

03:15.862 --> 03:18.865
Ah, the Black Hood, the Red Circle,
a town hall meeting.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.867
So much chaos and confusion.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.331
[Alice] How could you do this to me,
Elizabeth? To us?

03:26.414 --> 03:28.917
[Betty] Polly asked for my help, Mom.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.002
To run away. And you agreed?

03:31.085 --> 03:32.795
We know where she is.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.340
Frankly,
thank God she's out of Riverdale

03:35.423 --> 03:39.052
-and away from that psycho.
-You think that guarantees her safety?

03:39.135 --> 03:42.138
-Polly was scared.
-And you don't think that I am?

03:44.557 --> 03:45.934
[voice breaking] I'm terrified.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.397
[sobbing] Every time that you walk
out that door...

03:52.899 --> 03:56.694
every time that I call you
and you don't pick up the phone...

03:57.237 --> 03:58.821
my heart stops.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.242
But how am I supposed
to protect you two girls

04:02.325 --> 04:03.826
when you go and do this?

04:04.410 --> 04:06.579
And then you try
to make me the monster!

04:08.248 --> 04:09.082
[sobs]

04:15.838 --> 04:18.591
[Archie over phone] There's only
one of you, but we are legion.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.010
We're called the Red Circle.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.931
So, what did you think,
that I wouldn't see it?

04:28.977 --> 04:30.270
Dad, I was pissed off.

04:30.853 --> 04:34.065
We were all pissed off.
We were trying to send a message.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.316
Scare the Black Hood.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.070
More likely you'll antagonize
this maniac and become a target.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.823
Take it down.
Right now, while I can see.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.409
I already did.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.161
The original post.
But people keep sharing it.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.330
[sighs] Good grief, Archie.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.375
[Betty] My mom's spiraling.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.585
Think you can come over during lunch?

04:54.669 --> 04:57.046
Betty, I have to try
and at least maintain

04:57.130 --> 04:59.966
-a semblance of being a student here.
-[Archie] You think you can attack us...

05:00.049 --> 05:04.095
-Crap. I gotta go. I'll talk to you later.
-Riverdale is stronger than you.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.351
[sighs]

05:15.565 --> 05:17.859
Guess we're not watching
funny cat videos.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.694
[Archie on computer] We will find you.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.405
Check this out.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.951
Some sick-in-the-head Northsider
posted a video,

05:27.035 --> 05:29.454
-and we were just talking.
-About what?

05:29.662 --> 05:31.789
Fogarty wants to earn
his Serpent stripes.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.125
Bring us that Northsider's head,
you're in.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.502
-I'm down with that.
-[laughing]

05:36.586 --> 05:39.422
-No, guys. No--
-What, Jones?

05:40.006 --> 05:43.342
I know this guy. He's a milquetoast.
He's a football player.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.845
It's a lame target is all I'm saying.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.182
You wanna prove something?

05:50.266 --> 05:52.185
Why don't you go after the Black Hood?

05:53.519 --> 05:54.687
Why would we do that?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.564
He's targeting Northsiders,

05:56.647 --> 05:59.734
who blame us
for everything wrong with this town.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.695
We're sick of it.
Black Hood's doing our work for us.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.447
He's a hero.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.532
[students chattering]

06:10.078 --> 06:12.455
Black Hood...

06:12.538 --> 06:14.707
We're called the Red Circle...

06:14.791 --> 06:16.667
We're coming for you...

06:16.751 --> 06:20.880
We'll find you, we will hunt you...

06:20.963 --> 06:23.716
We will end you...

06:23.800 --> 06:25.009
Black hood.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.554
My parents want us to break up.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.807
They think
you're the teen American Psycho.

06:30.890 --> 06:35.186
-When do you care what they think?
-I don't. Except when I agree with them.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.439
-Can't you just support me on this?
-On what?

06:38.815 --> 06:42.735
Is this part of some master plan?
'Cause if it is, please enlighten me.

06:43.027 --> 06:46.614
You know, I don't see why
your dad's got such a problem with it.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.909
He gave me the idea.
He basically told me I should--

06:49.992 --> 06:53.412
Line up a bunch of semi-naked boys
straight out of Lord of the Flies,

06:53.496 --> 06:57.125
put them in ski masks and deliver
some Unabomber-like manifesto?

06:57.208 --> 07:00.378
-That what he said you should do?
-Fight fire with fire.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.588
Fight terror with terror.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.967
That's what he said.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.887
[Weatherbee over PA] Archie Andrews,
please report to the principal's office.

07:09.971 --> 07:10.805
[sighs]

07:13.141 --> 07:14.100
[Weatherbee] "We will find you.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.601
We will hunt you.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.520
And we will end you"?

07:18.896 --> 07:22.150
These are your sentiments.
And they are hardly comforting.

07:22.233 --> 07:26.028
You have my word, only one person
should be scared by that video.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.158
You're off the football team,
Mr. Andrews, effective immediately.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.702
In fact, there is no football team.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.913
Not until this
Red Circle insanity is over.

07:36.873 --> 07:40.084
If, by week's end,
you haven't written a signed letter

07:40.293 --> 07:43.337
apologizing to the entire
Riverdale High community

07:43.504 --> 07:46.674
and disbanded the Red Circle,
your suspension will begin.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.760
And will continue
until you've complied.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.096
Care to rethink your position?

07:54.765 --> 07:56.642
[inaudible]

07:59.061 --> 08:00.313
It's a crazy time, sir.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.858
We all have to do
what we think is right.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.872
[sighs] Betty. Okay.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.667
Telling my dad about me
cruising the woods, not cool.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.461
He even told my mom about it.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.173
Also, I've re-upped
my online membership

08:27.256 --> 08:28.925
to RedStateMeat.com,

08:29.008 --> 08:31.761
so there will be
no cruising for the foreseeable.

08:34.096 --> 08:34.931
Betty?

08:35.598 --> 08:36.599
What is it?

08:40.019 --> 08:42.563
I was going through
the Blue and Gold's mail...

08:45.691 --> 08:48.569
and I got a letter
from the Black Hood killer.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.992
He says he's doing it for me.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.674
[Kevin] "Betty, your words
at the Jubilee inspired me.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.677
The town's sinners
must show their contrition.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.555
If not, there will be more suffering
and bloodshed.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.847
Enclosed is a cipher.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.184
It details where I will punish
the next sinner. It is a test.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.936
Only you may solve it, Betty."

09:22.019 --> 09:24.272
[inhales deeply, then exhales]

09:25.523 --> 09:26.607
My speech...

09:28.234 --> 09:29.610
inspired him.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.823
-That stupid speech I wrote.
-So, the Black Hood was at the Jubilee.

09:33.906 --> 09:37.285
-The entire town was there.
-We have to give this to my dad.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.413
The cipher, yeah,
sure, but not the letter.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.706
This-- This is just...

09:42.790 --> 09:45.543
-for me. We can't tell anyone.
-It's evidence.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.504
If we give this to your dad,
he will tell my mom.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.923
She will make sure
I'm nowhere near this.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.341
-Good.
-No.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.634
This...

09:54.760 --> 09:55.803
is a test.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.723
He said so himself.

09:58.806 --> 10:03.853
What if... the start of the test
is to see what I do with the letter?

10:03.936 --> 10:04.895
Do I share it?

10:05.771 --> 10:07.815
Or not? Am I--? Am I strong?

10:08.232 --> 10:10.484
Or am I weak? Am I worthy?

10:10.568 --> 10:15.114
He is a psychopath, Betty,
and you are in high school, not the FBI.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.784
Isn't it better for people focus
on the cipher than the letter?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.369
How would that even happen?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.292
Mom.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.085
I'm so scared.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.713
I didn't know what to do or who to call.

10:30.796 --> 10:31.797
Oh, baby.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.592
Tell me what's going on
so I can make it better.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.261
I got this envelope
at the Blue and Gold.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.765
-Another letter from the Black Hood?
-No, not a letter.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.397
Was there anything else
in the envelope? A note?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.609
-Not according to Betty.
-Well, why a code this time?

10:52.109 --> 10:53.277
Not another letter?

10:53.778 --> 10:56.364
And why'd he send it
to your daughter and not you?

10:56.447 --> 10:57.990
Well, it's obvious, sheriff.

10:58.407 --> 11:02.119
He needs a platform to grandstand on,
and he's terrified of me.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.665
Well, there's a cryptologist
over in Centreville.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.083
I'll get it over to him.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.169
-But in the meantime--
-I've already published it.

11:10.252 --> 11:14.256
The entire town should be trying
to crack this code, don't you think?

11:17.927 --> 11:21.138
[Reggie] Damn it, Andrews. I told you
we shouldn't have made that video.

11:21.222 --> 11:25.017
Now Weatherbee suspended the team?
What if he comes after us next?

11:25.101 --> 11:27.812
That's why you wear hoods,
all the heat's on me.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.313
But it's not.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.357
It's falling on all of us.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.568
So, please, bro...

11:35.361 --> 11:36.821
sign the letter.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.408
No.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.662
We disband now, what message
does that show the Black Hood?

11:44.745 --> 11:46.539
That we're weak. Helpless.

11:47.623 --> 11:51.001
-No, we wanna force his hand.
-[boy] By doing what exactly?

11:51.377 --> 11:52.837
By going to his home turf.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.755
-The Southside.
-[Reggie] What?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.007
-Are you insane?
-[Archie] I've gone over this.

11:57.091 --> 12:01.137
Mrs. Cooper's convinced Black Hood
is a Southsider with an ax to grind.

12:01.220 --> 12:05.850
It makes sense when you think about
who he attacked: my dad, a Northsider.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.227
Moose and Midge,
both Northside kids.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.437
Grundy was in Greendale.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.189
Yeah. But before that,
she taught here, Doiley.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.483
Everyone saw our video and is riled-up.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.610
We can assume the Black Hood is, too.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.280
If there's even a chance
that he's a Southsider,

12:19.363 --> 12:22.491
us going into his territory,
making our presence known,

12:22.575 --> 12:23.617
could draw him out.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.828
The hunters become the hunted.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.330
-That's one way to find him.
-Nope.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.624
I'm done.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.002
We're done.

12:33.085 --> 12:33.961
Come on, guys.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.133
[door opens]

12:41.010 --> 12:41.844
[door closes]

12:44.472 --> 12:45.723
And then there was one.

12:47.224 --> 12:50.394
Which is what you wanted, right?
You and the Black Hood...

12:51.103 --> 12:52.188
mano a mano...

12:53.481 --> 12:54.315
to the death.

12:55.399 --> 12:59.778
-What the hell are you talking about?
-I know you possess a certain item.

13:02.198 --> 13:05.534
The Red Circle was just your way
to draw the Black Hood out.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.495
Now you wanna go into his territory.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.163
Maybe. Yeah.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.541
You're gonna need a few things.

13:13.375 --> 13:17.046
There's a place, on the edge of town.
They can help. Go after dark.

13:20.132 --> 13:20.966
[knock on door]

13:22.426 --> 13:23.427
Daddy?

13:29.433 --> 13:31.852
When Archie came into this room...

13:32.353 --> 13:33.437
Yeah?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.648
...what did you talk about?

13:36.232 --> 13:38.651
Don't remember, to be honest.
Why do you ask?

13:39.276 --> 13:40.903
I was just thinking, you know,

13:40.986 --> 13:45.449
one of the things I love about Archie
is how earnest he is.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.744
Not in a bad way,
more in an innocent sort of way.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.913
Trusting, kind.

13:51.705 --> 13:55.251
Of course, that simplicity
also makes him impressionable.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.837
Vulnerable to certain forms of attack.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.007
-What are you going on about?
-Manipulation.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.303
If someone were to, say...

14:06.929 --> 14:09.932
pour poison into
one of his cute-as-a-button ears...

14:11.225 --> 14:14.728
some dark notion
might take shape in his mind.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.523
Say, the Red Circle.

14:17.606 --> 14:21.068
-If you're suggesting--
-I'm not suggesting anything, Daddy.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.111
I'm asking.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.864
What did you
and my boyfriend talk about?

14:24.947 --> 14:27.324
And I've already told you,
I don't remember.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.871
Now... if you'll excuse me,
the Swiss banks are about to close,

14:31.954 --> 14:34.331
and I have a call
with the Lodge Charitable Trust.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.376
Trust. Right.

14:38.836 --> 14:39.670
Got it.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.133
Have a nice call, Daddy.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.677
[door opens, then closes]

14:54.977 --> 14:56.645
So, what are you reading?

14:58.564 --> 14:59.607
[sighs]

15:00.399 --> 15:02.401
Ah. Beware the Zodiac.

15:02.484 --> 15:03.319
It's decent,

15:03.402 --> 15:06.530
though I prefer Robert Graysmith's
definitive books on the subject.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.198
[cell phone buzzing]

15:10.242 --> 15:11.535
You need to get that?

15:13.829 --> 15:15.289
I'll call her back later.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.459
Jones, Jones, Jones.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.920
You disappoint me.

15:21.003 --> 15:24.381
If serial killers are your jam,
might I suggest Ted Bundy,

15:24.632 --> 15:27.176
Albert Fish, Aileen Wuornos.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.720
-They don't fit the profile.
-Right.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.514
Unlike most serial killers,
our guy wears a mask.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.518
-Well, a hood, when he kills.
-Someone consumed with self-loathing.

15:36.602 --> 15:40.022
Conversely, he sends letters
and cryptos to the press.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.734
Think he's narcissistic,
or a Batman villain?

15:44.151 --> 15:45.319
[both chuckle]

15:45.778 --> 15:47.488
I'm a true crime junkie.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.574
True crime is my crack.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.494
I figured,
and that's why I'm seeking you out.

15:54.870 --> 15:58.499
The Register didn't bash Southside
to post the Black Hood cipher.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.960
You wanna help me crack it?

16:06.256 --> 16:07.091
Sure.

16:18.686 --> 16:19.520
[sighs]

16:23.190 --> 16:24.024
[chimes]

16:34.576 --> 16:35.703
[sighs]

16:40.457 --> 16:42.292
[knocking on door]

16:43.627 --> 16:46.005
Hey. I was just on my way out.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.882
What's up?

16:52.136 --> 16:53.345
-Okay.
-There.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.347
That's my way of apologizing to you

16:55.681 --> 16:58.934
for raining on your Red Circle parade.
I wanna support you.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.479
And your comely crew.
Even risking enraging my parents.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.898
Especially my father,
which is just what he deserves,

17:04.982 --> 17:07.985
-after playing mind games with you.
-I really gotta go.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.279
Anyway, it's too late,
the Red Circle fell apart.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.282
-What? It's over? Already?
-For the other guys, yeah.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.076
This is my battle,
no one else needs to fight it.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.121
No, no, no.
If it's yours, then it's mine, too.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.166
And it can't just be you
against an armed madman.

17:22.249 --> 17:26.003
No, Riverdale needs the Red Circle
to expand, not contract.

17:26.086 --> 17:29.631
-Yeah, but the guys--
-Are spineless cowards, clearly.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.761
Lucky for you, I'm not.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.432
I gotta go.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.445
Hi, I'm hoping to get a few things.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.362
I have a list.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.535
You got I.D.?

17:59.244 --> 18:00.079
Yeah.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.131
I'll be paying cash for those, too.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.634
Just be a sec.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.933
Ammo, holster, Kevlar vest.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.227
You, uh...?

18:24.561 --> 18:26.021
You going hunting?

18:27.272 --> 18:28.440
Yeah. Yes.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.442
That's exactly what I'm doing.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.780
[knock on door]

18:35.697 --> 18:36.532
Betty?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.659
-What time is it?
-Seven-fifteen.

18:39.034 --> 18:43.080
-I wanted to catch you before school.
-I'm sorry. I have morning breath.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.957
You want coffee or something?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.709
No, I'm actually
on my way to the library.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.712
I asked Ms. Paroo
to set aside all the books

18:50.796 --> 18:53.382
she has about
cryptograms and ciphers.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.759
I thought it might
help us crack the code,

18:55.843 --> 18:58.846
which I'm hoping is something
we can do together, Jug.

19:03.016 --> 19:03.934
Um...

19:04.309 --> 19:05.144
Actually...

19:05.227 --> 19:06.937
[cereal rustling]

19:07.020 --> 19:10.691
funny enough,
Toni, of all people and I, we--

19:10.774 --> 19:13.652
We started working on that yesterday
at the Red and Black.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.280
I can show you what we've got so far.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.824
Toni.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.618
Because, let me guess...

19:22.703 --> 19:24.329
she loves serial killers.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.125
She does have an affinity
for the darker side of things.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.126
Mm.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.214
In that case,
why don't we all work on it together?

19:35.132 --> 19:38.051
-You, me, Toni, Kevin.
-Kevin?

19:38.135 --> 19:39.845
Yeah, it'll be like a little...

19:40.470 --> 19:42.222
code-breaking party.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.849
So fun. You can host.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.648
[Veronica] There you are.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.318
I have a surprise for you.

19:54.610 --> 19:58.280
It meant burning the midnight oil
and calling in a few favors, but...

19:58.363 --> 19:59.198
Ta-da.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.868
-You can't wear that.
-I'm not rocking this scoop-neck look?

20:02.951 --> 20:07.039
You can't have a target on your chest.
You'll stick out like a sore thumb.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.792
Oh, Archie, it's adorable
when you underestimate me.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.252
Come, come.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.965
[Archie] Oh, my God.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.302
[Veronica] Let Weatherbee do his worst.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.305
The Red Circle's no longer
a fringe band of radicals,

20:23.388 --> 20:26.016
it's a movement
with style and panache.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.644
[chattering]

20:42.032 --> 20:44.326
These symbols look so familiar to me.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.704
I've seen them before.
It's driving me crazy

20:47.788 --> 20:51.083
-I can't figure out where.
-Maybe if you loosened your ponytail.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.088
What? That was a joke, guys.

20:56.171 --> 20:59.091
Betty's ponytail is iconic
and beyond reproach.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.926
[Betty] Kev, it's fine.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.720
At this point,
I'm willing to try anything.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.393
Per Mrs. Paroo's books,

21:09.559 --> 21:11.895
I've been looking for
common-letter associations,

21:11.979 --> 21:14.606
like T-H, A-N, I-N-G.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.566
I'm looking for doubles. Double L.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.152
-Four-letter words like "kill."
-Morbid.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.322
We don't know if it's in English.
Could be an anagram.

21:22.406 --> 21:26.326
-Like, literally on the top of my brain.
-Let's go back to the basics.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.704
What do we know about him?
Who is he?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.622
He's a white male, in his 40s.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.501
-Like almost every serial killer ever.
-No, I mean, like, why...?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.503
Why is he killing people?

21:36.586 --> 21:38.005
Or at least, why now?

21:39.923 --> 21:42.843
We know the Hood's
obsessed with cleansing the town

21:42.926 --> 21:44.928
of sinners and hypocrites, right?

21:45.012 --> 21:49.558
And he seems to be attacking anyone
with ties to the Northside.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.643
Here we go with the fake news again.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.479
You Northsiders and your privilege.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.023
All you do is demonize the Southside,

21:56.106 --> 21:58.066
so of course you think
the Black Hood's from there.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.027
It's not demonizing, Toni.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.862
It's stating facts.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.489
There's way more drugs
and gangs and--

22:04.573 --> 22:08.285
The drugs which are sold
primarily to Northside crackheads?

22:08.368 --> 22:11.788
What about Northside Neo-Nazis,
the Red Circle?

22:11.872 --> 22:15.667
[scoffs] The Red Psychos, you mean.
I'm surprised you haven't said it yet.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.252
-Said what?
-That you think

22:17.336 --> 22:18.837
the Black Hood's a Serpent.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.465
We know how much you hate us.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.092
-That's not true.
-I don't hate the Serpents.

22:24.176 --> 22:28.305
Yeah? Then why is it your boyfriend
lies about sitting with us at lunch?

22:32.434 --> 22:33.435
I'm gonna go.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.104
Yeah, I'm gonna get out of here, too.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.732
Okay. I can walk you home.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.153
Or you can walk me home.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.571
Uh, bye, guys.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.240
[door opens, then closes]

22:47.491 --> 22:51.578
Listen, Betty, I sit with the Serpents
purely for reasons of survival.

22:51.661 --> 22:54.581
It's okay. Let's just
keep working on the cipher.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.583
-The clock's ticking.
-What clock?

22:56.666 --> 22:59.211
-This could be his laundry list.
-Or kill list.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.048
[Betty sighs]

23:39.376 --> 23:40.252
[dog barks]

24:01.314 --> 24:02.357
[boys laughing]

24:04.109 --> 24:05.152
Hey.

24:05.735 --> 24:08.363
-What are you doing?
-Back off. I'm not here for you.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.657
Yeah?
Then who's this message for, huh?

24:12.075 --> 24:13.869
Oh, hell. [chuckles]

24:13.952 --> 24:16.663
Don't tell me it's for the Black Hood.
You believe this guy?

24:17.330 --> 24:19.207
People say
we're the troublemakers.

24:20.876 --> 24:21.710
Whoa.

24:23.837 --> 24:27.841
Southside's Serpent country.
You can't come here and tag our turf.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.052
So, why don't you get back
to the Northside...

24:31.178 --> 24:33.722
-before somebody gets hurt?
-Get out of my way...

24:34.306 --> 24:36.183
or someone will get hurt.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.476
You just made a big mistake.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.151
-Who made a mistake?
-[boy] Whoa.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.653
-What the hell, man?
-Who made a mistake?

24:51.281 --> 24:52.824
Come on, let's go.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.159
Come on, man.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.619
[panting]

25:13.094 --> 25:14.596
[cell phone buzzing]

25:15.305 --> 25:16.181
[gasps]

25:17.599 --> 25:18.433
What?

25:19.142 --> 25:20.602
-Oh, my neck.
-We fell asleep.

25:21.478 --> 25:24.731
-How did we fall asleep?
-We were exhausted.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.566
-It's not easy being us.
-My God.

25:28.151 --> 25:29.694
My God, she's gonna kill me.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.696
-I have to go.
-What?

25:32.447 --> 25:35.325
My mom, I-- She's gonna kill me.
I have to go, okay? Um...

25:36.493 --> 25:37.827
I'll call you later.

25:39.913 --> 25:40.789
[knock on door]

25:42.165 --> 25:43.875
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Phylum.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.963
Sheriff Keller and I need to see
Archie Andrews.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.048
[students murmuring]

25:52.175 --> 25:55.679
I'm sorry, Principal Weatherbee,
but the T-shirts were my idea.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.806
This is not about T-shirts.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.516
-Please sit down.
-[Archie] It's okay.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.017
Nothing to worry about.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.151
We got a tip,
a bodega owner on the Southside

26:10.235 --> 26:13.947
said a Riverdale High student
was waving a gun in front of his shop.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.949
Said it looked like he had red hair.

26:16.032 --> 26:17.993
I was in my garage
working on some songs.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.621
Nevertheless, given your behavior
over the last several days,

26:21.705 --> 26:25.041
we need to look in your locker
for any weapons or contraband.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.961
-Weapons? Don't you need a warrant?
-No, I do not.

26:28.044 --> 26:30.922
-Maybe we should call my dad.
-I did. He's informed.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.465
Open the locker or I will.

26:33.758 --> 26:34.592
[sighs]

26:37.554 --> 26:39.306
I don't know
what you think you'll find.

26:51.359 --> 26:52.902
[Keller] Well, this is interesting.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.821
What? There's no gun.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.200
Where'd you get this hood?

26:59.534 --> 27:01.119
[sighs] I can explain that.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.249
-[dishes clatter]
-[thunder rumbling]

27:06.875 --> 27:09.085
The hood's not mine, it's Reggie's.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.088
He came by wearing it
trying to scare me.

27:12.172 --> 27:14.215
Yeah, well, I don't know what to say.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.551
I'm at a loss, Archie.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.512
Keller and Weatherbee
think you're a threat,

27:19.596 --> 27:22.891
so they bar you from school property.
And I can't tell them any different.

27:25.226 --> 27:26.144
I was shot.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.731
And the man who shot me
is still out there,

27:29.814 --> 27:32.609
playing some cat-and-mouse game
with this town.

27:32.692 --> 27:33.693
And he scares me.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.572
But not as much as you do right now.

27:37.739 --> 27:41.117
Because I have no idea
what is going on in your mind and...

27:42.160 --> 27:43.912
I don't know
what you're gonna do next.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.288
Wait, Dad. Can we talk?

27:45.372 --> 27:48.124
When I get back
from the town hall we can talk.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.336
If you're ready to be honest with me
and let me back in.

27:54.297 --> 27:55.131
[door closes]

28:00.804 --> 28:01.888
[Hermione] Nice T-shirt.

28:03.056 --> 28:07.018
Will you wear it when Archie's arrested
for reckless endangerment, or worse?

28:07.102 --> 28:08.853
Archie would never, Mom.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.606
-He's being railroaded.
-You can say that...

28:12.690 --> 28:15.735
with absolute certainty
after watching that video?

28:17.487 --> 28:18.321
[exhales sharply]

28:18.905 --> 28:19.781
Maybe you can.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.118
Or maybe you're just being loyal.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.788
But let me tell you
something about loyalty.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.373
[thunder rumbling]

28:28.456 --> 28:30.625
There's nothing more honorable than it.

28:31.751 --> 28:32.710
Noble, even.

28:34.295 --> 28:35.463
But blind loyalty?

28:38.800 --> 28:41.052
That is a stupid and dangerous thing.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.932
I pray that's not the case
with you and Archie.

28:46.766 --> 28:47.809
[thunder crashing]

28:50.812 --> 28:53.231
[Jughead] When you left,
you forgot some of your books.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.482
Your notebooks.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.152
And I wasn't snooping,
believe it or not, but...

28:58.319 --> 28:59.696
it just fell out.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.365
What did?

29:03.491 --> 29:05.660
Your letter from the Black Hood.

29:05.869 --> 29:06.703
Jug.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.913
I'm assuming it came with the cipher?

29:08.997 --> 29:11.583
-Betty, why haven't you told anybody?
-I did.

29:11.666 --> 29:12.584
I told Kevin.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.503
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because you've been...

29:16.171 --> 29:19.966
-running around with the Serpents.
-I've been gone for two days.

29:20.049 --> 29:22.510
Yeah, it sucks we don't go
to the same school,

29:22.594 --> 29:24.846
but that's not the reason
you're sitting on the fact

29:24.929 --> 29:27.891
that the Black Hood sent you a letter.
So, why is it?

29:27.974 --> 29:29.851
Because of what it says, Jughead!

29:30.435 --> 29:31.978
Because of what he wrote.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.148
That I...

29:36.483 --> 29:37.984
inspired him.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.237
I inspired all of this madness.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.782
You think people are gonna blame you
for this?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.077
Not people. Just...

29:48.828 --> 29:50.872
-one person.
-Archie?

29:54.709 --> 29:55.585
For what?

29:55.668 --> 29:58.838
For writing a speech that this lunatic
has twisted around

29:58.922 --> 30:01.633
in order to mess with you,
and mess with the town?

30:01.716 --> 30:05.386
Yeah, Archie's definitely shook,
but he knows who the bad guys are.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.430
And you're not one of the bad guys.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.350
You're Betty Cooper.

30:10.433 --> 30:13.102
You're like Nancy Drew
meets Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.816
-Oh, my God.
-What?

30:17.899 --> 30:22.320
In his letter, the Black Hood said
only I could solve the cipher.

30:22.403 --> 30:25.031
Like he created it specifically for me.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.909
Maybe using one of my touchstones.
Jug...

30:28.910 --> 30:31.996
if I'm right,
I think I know how to decode this.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.791
Let's go.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.668
-[cell phone ringing]
-[thunder crashing]

30:38.503 --> 30:41.005
Archie? What the hell is going on?

30:41.422 --> 30:42.257
Are you okay?

30:42.549 --> 30:44.467
[Archie]
I need you to get something for me.

30:53.768 --> 30:54.769
[thunder crashing]

31:15.290 --> 31:19.168
At least you were smart enough
not to keep it in your locker. But a gun?

31:19.252 --> 31:20.795
Why? For what?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.213
To protect myself.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.631
Against the Black Hood?

31:23.715 --> 31:24.924
[rain pattering]

31:25.008 --> 31:25.884
Archie.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.928
That video, the gun.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.431
If I'm following you,
I need to know where.

31:31.514 --> 31:34.559
-I need to know the truth.
-I want him dead, Veronica!

31:36.519 --> 31:38.980
I want the Black Hood dead.

31:40.481 --> 31:42.400
And I wanna be the one who does it.

31:43.401 --> 31:46.779
I wanna be...
the last thing that he sees.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.867
-Spoken like a true vigilante.
-No, you wanted the truth.

31:50.950 --> 31:54.746
I made that video and showed my face
so he'd make me his next target.

31:54.829 --> 31:57.123
I went to the Southside
hoping he would come for me.

31:57.206 --> 32:00.627
So, you find the Black Hood
and you shoot him, and then what?

32:01.044 --> 32:02.086
You go to jail.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.380
Or you miss him
and he kills you, Archie.

32:04.464 --> 32:07.091
-Doesn't matter what happens to me.
-Yes. It matters to me,

32:07.175 --> 32:09.010
and your dad, Betty, Jughead.

32:13.473 --> 32:17.685
Meanwhile, like an idiot, I'm... trying to
support you by designing T-shirts.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.811
I didn't ask you to.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.439
No, you asked me
to go fetch your loaded gun.

32:21.689 --> 32:25.485
In case you were wondering where it is,
I threw it in Sweetwater River.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.904
-What?
-You can be mad at me now,

32:27.987 --> 32:29.530
but you'll thank me later.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.615
[banging on door]

32:30.698 --> 32:32.283
[thunder crashing]

32:32.367 --> 32:33.743
Wait. What if it's--?

32:37.080 --> 32:38.122
Reggie?

32:38.706 --> 32:39.624
Can we come in?

32:49.008 --> 32:52.136
Parents of Riverdale,
I've heard your concerns.

32:52.845 --> 32:53.721
I share them.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.684
As your mayor, my top priorities
are ensuring the safety

32:57.767 --> 33:00.103
of our town and our children.

33:00.603 --> 33:04.065
The purpose of this town hall
is to answer your questions,

33:04.148 --> 33:06.567
and, if I can, to ease your minds.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.779
[Veronica] To what do we owe
this unexpected honor?

33:09.862 --> 33:12.281
Archie could've told Weatherbee
the hood was mine...

33:12.949 --> 33:13.950
but he didn't.

33:14.033 --> 33:17.954
In the Book of Reg,
that makes you a top-tier loyal badass.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.206
And we were talking today,

33:20.289 --> 33:23.251
and decided, if you wanna
keep the Red Circle going...

33:23.960 --> 33:25.503
we're here for you, dude.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.797
[engine revving]

33:35.430 --> 33:38.182
And not a moment too soon.
Archie, trouble.

33:50.236 --> 33:52.238
[Sweet Pea]
How stupid are you Northsiders?

33:52.321 --> 33:54.615
You really think
you can come to my house,

33:54.699 --> 33:57.285
stick a gun in my face
in front of my boys,

33:57.785 --> 33:59.454
and there wouldn't be any payback?

34:01.247 --> 34:04.042
You have crap timing, bro.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.879
Bulldogs eat Serpents for lunch.

34:08.629 --> 34:09.797
We'll see about that.

34:10.590 --> 34:13.176
-And the more, the merrier.
-Hey, chill.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.844
Veronica, stay here.

34:15.178 --> 34:18.056
-What? Archie, no.
-Veronica, after my dad...

34:18.681 --> 34:21.225
I made a promise
to protect him and this house.

34:22.727 --> 34:23.561
Stay here.

34:26.314 --> 34:28.232
-If you want a fight, we'll fight.
-What about your gun?

34:28.316 --> 34:30.985
-What about your knife?
-How about no weapons?

34:31.778 --> 34:35.406
If you troglodytes insist on doing this,
there are gonna be rules.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.743
Or should I call Sheriff Keller
to be referee?

34:40.078 --> 34:43.331
When I was a kid, I used to check out
this book obsessively.

34:47.960 --> 34:48.795
Betty...

34:52.799 --> 34:55.843
Budget is tight.
We are putting together a helpline

34:55.927 --> 34:58.221
you can call
to report suspicious activity.

34:58.304 --> 35:02.016
Sounds an awful lot
like the Red Circle's hotline to me.

35:03.017 --> 35:04.769
Did you have a question, Alice?

35:05.061 --> 35:07.730
I'm wondering when you're gonna
actually address

35:07.814 --> 35:10.817
the real problem in Riverdale:
The Southside.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.861
[scattered applause]

35:14.946 --> 35:17.573
[McCoy] All in due time, Alice.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.076
We're here to talk about
the Black Hood.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.620
Sheriff Keller has a plan
he's putting in place,

35:22.703 --> 35:25.081
-beginning with a town-wide curfew.
-Curfew?

35:25.581 --> 35:28.751
We need to show strength, not cower.

35:28.835 --> 35:33.548
Let's start by closing down
that drug-ridden Southside High

35:33.631 --> 35:36.717
and use that money
to bolster our police department.

35:37.301 --> 35:41.556
Hire more deputies,
who can actually protect our children.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.684
-[crowd applauding]
-Okay, just a minute. Just a second.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.524
Oh, my God.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.111
"I will strike next where it all began."

35:58.781 --> 36:02.076
Your speech... Town hall. Come on.

36:02.201 --> 36:07.081
That neighborhood is a blight
of empty storefronts and vacant lots.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.168
A pit of violence waiting to erupt.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.171
Just ask Fred Andrews.

36:13.421 --> 36:19.135
Himself a victim of a vicious,
insane Southsider's bloodlust.

36:23.431 --> 36:26.934
You say this town's being divided?
You're holding the cleaver.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.395
The Southside is not the issue.

36:30.104 --> 36:33.566
The issue is, there is a guy out there
with a gun and a hood.

36:33.649 --> 36:37.403
He's bringing out the worst
in this town. Pitting it against itself.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.950
[all yelling]

36:43.034 --> 36:44.577
[thunder crashing]

36:45.161 --> 36:46.746
[all grunting]

36:48.247 --> 36:51.876
Of course, Fred Andrews
turns the other cheek, as usual.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.004
I can't say much about your son,
Archie,

36:55.129 --> 36:57.757
but at least he's out there
throwing elbows.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.010
[grunting]

37:04.180 --> 37:07.934
-We have to be united in this fight.
-[crowd applauding]

37:08.017 --> 37:12.688
Okay? If we let fear take over,
start demonizing each other?

37:13.981 --> 37:15.399
That's when we're dead.

37:15.483 --> 37:16.609
[applauding]

37:17.401 --> 37:19.654
I told you
Fred was gonna be a problem.

37:19.737 --> 37:20.571
I don't know.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.407
The town loves and trusts him.

37:24.116 --> 37:25.451
Could work in our favor.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.078
[thunder crashing]

37:28.246 --> 37:29.538
Everybody needs to leave now.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.707
[Jughead]
The Black Hood's coming here.

37:31.791 --> 37:35.294
-He said this is his next target.
-You mean he's coming here?

37:35.378 --> 37:37.588
-Cipher says he's coming to the town hall.
-[Alice] What?

37:38.381 --> 37:39.882
[electricity powering down]

37:39.966 --> 37:43.302
Everyone, stay calm and in your seats.
We'll sort this out.

37:48.307 --> 37:49.558
[alarm ringing]

37:50.726 --> 37:52.061
[all continue grunting]

38:00.194 --> 38:01.279
Dilton!

38:02.363 --> 38:03.197
[thunder crashing]

38:26.345 --> 38:27.722
Let's go!

38:27.805 --> 38:29.265
Guys, just go.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.017
Help me. Help.

38:36.939 --> 38:38.357
[engine revving]

38:42.153 --> 38:43.946
When they ask you at the hospital...

38:44.238 --> 38:47.742
I was minding my business when
Serpents jumped me for no reason.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.788
[Alice] Well, Elizabeth? We're waiting.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.084
[Betty] This is from the Black Hood.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.128
It came with the cipher.

38:59.628 --> 39:01.672
So, you've been keeping this from us?

39:06.469 --> 39:07.636
[Alice] Oh, my God, Betty.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.014
[thunder crashing]

39:14.560 --> 39:16.228
-[groans]
-Sorry.

39:16.729 --> 39:17.605
No.

39:18.564 --> 39:19.440
I deserve it.

39:20.941 --> 39:22.860
Tonight was really messed up, Ronnie.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.031
Things got so out of control.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.910
At least Dilton's gonna be okay.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.995
Yeah, but only because of you.

39:33.704 --> 39:34.914
You saved him, Ronnie.

39:36.957 --> 39:37.792
And me.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.381
[Veronica]
These are fraught times, Archie.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.050
No one's thinking straight.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.721
We have to... hold on to each other.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.226
Right?

39:56.602 --> 39:59.146
I'm sorry I lied
about getting rid of the gun.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.773
I was freaking out.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.900
God, Ronnie, if I'd had it tonight...

40:05.903 --> 40:08.239
I don't wanna think about it.
I might've...

40:09.323 --> 40:10.157
But you didn't.

40:13.536 --> 40:14.370
And--

40:16.122 --> 40:18.040
And I don't believe you would've...

40:20.376 --> 40:21.836
even if you'd had it.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.385
You're not a killer.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.697
-[groans]
-[chuckles]

40:49.780 --> 40:50.739
I'm sorry.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.076
Mm.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.412
-Wait.
-What?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.918
We have one more thing
we need to do tonight.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.508
[Jughead] And so the young lovers
went back to where it all began...

41:10.509 --> 41:11.760
Sweetwater River...

41:12.428 --> 41:15.723
to try and end the cycle of violence.

41:18.267 --> 41:21.520
We'd come to think of that night,
the night of the rumble...

41:22.271 --> 41:25.232
the night of the town hall,
as a turning point.

41:25.858 --> 41:29.069
Riverdale would no longer be
"the town with pep."

41:29.862 --> 41:34.575
From now on, it would be known as
"the town that dreaded sundown."

41:40.039 --> 41:42.041
[cell phone ringing]

41:48.714 --> 41:49.548
Hello?

41:49.882 --> 41:50.716
[man] Hello, Betty.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.345
This is the Black Hood speaking.
