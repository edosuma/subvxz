WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:03.586
With teamwork comes trust.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.547
With trust comes success.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.591
These are all principles that I practi...

00:09.093 --> 00:10.259
Well, well, well.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.928
Look-ee what we got here.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.930
Three young bucks. I like it.

00:14.098 --> 00:16.474
More like frickin' hung bucks.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.893
'Cause our things are huge.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.937
- Who are you?
- I am Teddy,

00:21.105 --> 00:23.856
and corporate has sent me here
because tomorrow,

00:24.024 --> 00:28.236
I will be running the TelAmeriCorp
team building competition,

00:28.320 --> 00:30.780
the winners of which get a weekend

00:30.864 --> 00:35.660
at a beautiful timeshare in
sunny Palm Springs, California.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.120
- Yeah.
- Ooh.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.663
So, like, what's the deal
with the competition?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.915
Well, I don't want to give too much away,

00:40.999 --> 00:43.918
but let's just say there'll be lots of activities

00:44.002 --> 00:48.464
that include teamwork, cooperation,
and trust...

00:49.007 --> 00:50.883
Falls! Gil!

00:51.135 --> 00:53.678
Boom! Boom! Yeah.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.263
Good job, Gil.
He's really strong.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.683
Each team is gonna get a T-shirt.
What color would you boys like to be?

00:58.892 --> 00:59.892
- Red.
- We call blue.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.686
- Yellow.
- Red.

01:01.854 --> 01:02.854
- Blue.
- Yellow.

01:02.938 --> 01:06.149
You fools are already starting
on the wrong foot, huh?

01:06.316 --> 01:09.652
Tez, shut up your gigantic mouth.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.488
Because there's one thing about us
that you did not count on.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.824
- Trust fall.
- What?

01:15.451 --> 01:18.077
What the heck, man. My cereal.

01:18.162 --> 01:22.373
- Looking more like bust fall.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.835
Bust fall. You should tweet that. Yeah.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.296
You boys owe me some cereal.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.384
I'm fresh

01:35.053 --> 01:37.138
You gotta, you gotta,
You gotta, gotta

01:37.222 --> 01:38.389
Gotta be fresh

01:40.768 --> 01:42.894
- I'm fine.
- Lloyd was pissed. Did you see him?

01:43.353 --> 01:44.937
- Did you see how big his eyes get?

01:47.024 --> 01:49.692
I got to tell you, I've seen some sad stuff
around this office,

01:49.777 --> 01:53.279
but that bust fall was straight bust y'all.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.448
Hey, Tez. Still not funny.

01:55.532 --> 01:59.786
Well, Twitter thought it was hilarious.
Nine faves and a re-tweet. Thank you, Bill.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.204
- Nine faves.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.455
- Wow.
- That's a lot.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.874
Okay, I wouldn't make a big deal
about it, okay?

02:04.958 --> 02:07.877
We haven't even had our morning
sugar-free Red Bulls. We're still waking up.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.796
- We're getting the sleep out of our eyes.
- That's true.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.298
We know each other so well.
We're, like, telepathic.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.884
Like, for instance,
what's my favorite movie of all time?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.093
- Hocus Pocus.
- Thank you.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.512
What is my most viewed website?

02:17.596 --> 02:19.514
GoddessPost at work, Pornhub at home.

02:19.598 --> 02:20.640
- True.
- What's my favorite thing...

02:20.724 --> 02:21.682
Swimming.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.975
- There it is.
- Wow.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.519
All this is just surface chatter.

02:24.603 --> 02:28.731
You see, Bill and I have a complex, adult,
mature relationship.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.233
We get real.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.109
Bill, what's my biggest regret?

02:32.236 --> 02:34.529
Not forgiving your father
for his destructive gambling

02:34.613 --> 02:35.696
before he died.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.240
What's my biggest fear?

02:37.533 --> 02:38.616
That you'll die alone.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.078
- Crazier things have happened.
- What do y'all guys got?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.580
You think you know each other?
Adam, tell me, then.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.249
What's Ders' biggest fear?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.543
Uh...

02:49.253 --> 02:52.463
That his dick is smaller than mine, obviously.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.175
- Ooh, I'm so scared.
- Yeah, he's scared about it.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.011
Yeah, I know. I bet he is.
I've seen his dick before. It's weird-looking.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.388
- Yeah.
- Very weird color.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.515
Yeah, the color of, like, a pomegranate tea.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.267
Tell me about your friend.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.185
What's Blake's biggest regret?

03:06.520 --> 03:07.728
Oh, I know this one.

03:07.813 --> 03:11.023
It's uh... It's got to be those fish tacos
he had for breakfast.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.859
Heartburn city, right?

03:12.943 --> 03:15.611
Eww, are you kidding me?
Those were fish? I thought they were chicken.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.489
Now I'm really regretting 'em. I hate fish.

03:18.574 --> 03:21.576
Guys, I'm serious. I'm allergic to fish.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.661
We put fish in 'em. We put fish in 'em.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.787
We should take him to a hospital.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.331
- We just said, "Give us your fish."
- Is that why my eyes itch?

03:27.583 --> 03:29.625
- Oh, my god.
- We just said, "Give us your fish."

03:29.710 --> 03:30.918
He went to the bathroom, we're like,

03:31.003 --> 03:32.295
"We'll order for you. Give us your fish."

03:32.379 --> 03:34.297
Your new nickname is "Fish Taco."

03:35.549 --> 03:37.633
This is like Romper Room
in here right now.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.552
Y'all a bunch of children.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.096
That P. Springs? It's in the bag.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.557
Why did you think they were chicken?

03:44.641 --> 03:46.642
I don't know. They smelled like chicken.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.062
Okay, so say Montez is right,
which he's probably not.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.065
What could you guys possibly want to know
about me?

03:53.275 --> 03:55.234
If we're gonna win this,
we need to connect at the core.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.861
- Yes.
- So, like, a Tez question.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.697
Blake, what is your biggest secret? Go.

03:59.781 --> 04:03.075
Anders, my life is an open book.
I'm not gonna read it to you, bud.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.535
I'm not telling you my biggest secret.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.078
Hey, you guys live here?

04:06.622 --> 04:09.498
No, we just sit on a stranger's roof
and drink beer.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.085
Is that true? It could be.
I don't know you guys.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.171
Yeah, we do live here, yeah.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.925
Okay, well, I'm working valet
for the pride party down the street.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.676
Pride party, nice.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.094
We're big MMA dudes, man.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.014
Yeah, man, I like my martial arts
like I like my women.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.098
Mixed, baby!

04:26.183 --> 04:28.643
Okay, well, look, we're running out of parking.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.728
Can I use your driveway for the overflow?

04:31.313 --> 04:32.480
Yeah, sure, sure.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.857
Go ahead, but, like, one question.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.442
How is there a party on our block,

04:36.526 --> 04:38.277
and they didn't
invite dem boys?

04:38.362 --> 04:39.362
We dem boys.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.446
How are we not invited?

04:40.530 --> 04:42.114
Yeah, how are we not invited?

04:42.199 --> 04:43.449
Yeah, how are we not invited?

04:43.533 --> 04:45.409
Yeah, yeah, yeah, how are we not invited?

04:45.494 --> 04:46.994
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
how are we not invited?

04:47.079 --> 04:49.622
What? What?
How are we not invited?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.749
How are we not invited?
Come on! Come on!

04:51.833 --> 04:53.417
Okay, I'm gonna park the car here.

04:53.919 --> 04:54.961
How are we not invited?

04:55.045 --> 04:56.087
Oh, oh

04:56.171 --> 04:57.254
How's he not invited?

04:57.547 --> 05:00.257
Get them muscles out. It's a pride party.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.385
Who wants to get put in a rear naked choke?

05:05.722 --> 05:08.015
- Eh, we should get going, right?
- Rainbows, rainbows.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.976
Hi, welcome to the party.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.395
There's hors d'oeuvres
and an open bar in back.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.191
Hello

05:17.734 --> 05:18.901
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.319
Hello. Come on.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.030
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.907
- Who are they?
- I don't... I don't know.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.618
Dude, are you pretending to be gay?

05:27.703 --> 05:30.037
What? Yeah, man. I don't want to give them
a reason to kick us out.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.831
- This party seems pretty sweet.
- That's true.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.375
Gay dudes are like hot chicks.
They only party with each other.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.459
- Exactly.
- Right?

05:35.544 --> 05:36.794
Hi, I don't believe we've met.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.254
I'm Joey, and this is Scott.

05:38.338 --> 05:42.341
Wow, it is very surprising to me
that we haven't run into each other,

05:42.426 --> 05:45.261
because we are just
very involved in the scene.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.470
The scene?

05:46.638 --> 05:51.142
Yes. The having sex with
other gay men scene.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.560
Discos.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.106
Yeah, we're three-way gay with each other.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.692
It's just a shame we don't wear
the same sized clothes, huh?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.446
So that you could wear each other's clothes.

06:03.572 --> 06:04.947
- That is the reason.
- Right, yeah.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.574
Cool party. Later, bitches.

06:08.118 --> 06:11.662
- Why are they pretending to be gay?
- Are they?

06:11.997 --> 06:14.874
Well, that little one looks like
he could be a bottom.

06:23.425 --> 06:24.717
- To free booze.
- Boom.

06:25.969 --> 06:29.430
Okay, Ders' turn.
What is something that makes you feel stuff?

06:30.307 --> 06:32.058
- Hmm?
- I'm still pretty uncomfortable

06:32.142 --> 06:33.142
talking about this stuff.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.852
So maybe we order a few more drinks,

06:34.936 --> 06:36.979
-and then the feelings will just flop out.
- Whoo!

06:37.731 --> 06:38.856
Calling all freaks

06:38.940 --> 06:40.483
All freaks
All freaks

06:41.818 --> 06:43.736
Oh, you're turning me on,
dude.

06:44.154 --> 06:48.074
Here's a secret: if ejack tasted this good,
I'd drink it by the frickin' gallon.

06:49.284 --> 06:53.662
We're here! We're queer!
We want to drink beer!

06:53.747 --> 06:56.582
- Why isn't there beer?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.417
I'm gonna help myself.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.003
I can shake it so fast.
Look how fast I can shake it.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.254
Baby

07:02.339 --> 07:03.589
We're queer!

07:03.965 --> 07:05.341
We're here!

07:05.884 --> 07:07.259
We're here!

07:09.304 --> 07:11.013
Bottle landed right on my head.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.598
I dropped it right on my head.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.975
I sucked this guy's dick before, I think.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.977
Grr, I'm gonna butt ram you.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.021
Happy Pride Day!

07:20.524 --> 07:22.191
- Dog pile!

07:23.360 --> 07:26.487
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.948
What, dude? It's actually still pretty good.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.367
Oh, we're so bonded right now.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.036
We're three-way gay!

07:39.251 --> 07:40.793
Blazer, shut up.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.044
Close the curtains, dude.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.505
Ow, ow, ow. Easy with the sheets, man.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.674
Ah, my knees.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.093
Whose bedroom is this?

07:49.302 --> 07:51.303
Oh, my head.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.514
Dude, you got frosting all over your chest.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.058
Mmm. Yummy.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.149
It's not frosting.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.192
- What is it?
- That's jizz.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.277
There's jizz on my chest!

08:06.361 --> 08:07.319
- Jizz!
- Whoa!

08:07.404 --> 08:09.405
It used to be frickin' wet, but now it's dry.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.531
- It's dry jizz.
- Eww.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.615
Why's there jizz on me?

08:11.700 --> 08:13.826
Um... I...

08:14.244 --> 08:16.662
- What?
- Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.587
Okay, this is bad.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.422
This is really, really bad.

08:26.590 --> 08:30.050
You guys, please stop yelling.
You're gonna wake up the neighbors.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.970
Guess what? We're awake,
and I'm gonna freakin' call the police,

08:33.054 --> 08:34.722
'cause I was ejacked on illegally.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.640
- What?
- We've been sexually assaulted, okay?

08:36.725 --> 08:38.017
Perhaps roofied, all right?

08:38.101 --> 08:39.727
Call a toxologist right now.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.312
We were drugged and then fugged.

08:41.396 --> 08:42.396
Drugged and fugged.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.566
- No, you weren't.
- You guys.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.985
You fucked the crap out of each other.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.570
- What?
- What?

08:49.654 --> 08:51.530
- No.
- They don't remember.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.615
Really?

08:52.991 --> 08:55.618
We heard all this grunting
coming from in here,

08:55.702 --> 08:57.161
so we came down the hall,

08:57.954 --> 08:58.954
and...

09:00.207 --> 09:03.500
- What?
- You boys were rockin' each other's worlds.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.544
You kept saying how you
wanted to get closer,

09:05.629 --> 09:07.504
and then you were just inside each other.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.966
- What?
- It was a real three-ring bone circus.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.683
No! No!

09:20.143 --> 09:21.185
Wild.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.274
Wow. You guys look like you had
a little too much fun last night.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.359
No we don't. You do.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.694
You ready to get your butts handed to you?

09:30.779 --> 09:31.904
No, all right?

09:32.322 --> 09:35.324
'Cause our butts are our own.
Nobody else handles them. So just shut up.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.078
All right, TelAmericans! Yeah!

09:39.162 --> 09:40.246
Whoo!

09:40.330 --> 09:42.039
When I say "Tela," you say "mericans."

09:42.123 --> 09:43.415
- Tela!
- Mericans.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.085
Yeah! Boom! That's what I'm talking about.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.753
I hope you people all brought your hard hats,

09:47.837 --> 09:50.965
because today, we are gonna be
building some teams.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.675
- Oh. That's funny.
- Boom!

09:52.759 --> 09:55.970
- I'm Teddy. I will be your foreman.
- Ugh.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.305
And that will be the end
of the building metaphors.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.474
All right, let's break some ground!

10:00.558 --> 10:02.643
- Ugh.
- Okay. That was the last one.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.396
Here we go. Stage dive. Whoa!

10:05.480 --> 10:07.022
Palm springs! Get some!

10:07.107 --> 10:08.232
- Get it!
- Okay, Jillian.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.358
- Get it hard!
- Chill out.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.194
There is no way we're gonna win
this stupid thing with Gary on our team.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.989
I was a spy in Hong Kong.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.991
Team Yellow, where are we? Here we go.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.244
Boom! The green team, here we go.
Yeah, there you are.

10:20.328 --> 10:24.039
And since you boys couldn't
decide on one color,

10:24.124 --> 10:27.167
I had these made up for you special.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.878
You're my rainbow warriors!

10:31.131 --> 10:32.798
- Of course we are.
- Yeah, let's do this!

10:32.882 --> 10:34.842
- Okay.
- Whichever team gets the most eggs

10:34.926 --> 10:37.886
in their basket in a minute
is gonna get a 20-second

10:38.013 --> 10:42.641
head start for the final event,
the obstacle race.

10:42.934 --> 10:47.021
- All right, everybody. On your marks.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.523
Adam, go.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.150
- I'm going.
- Back up.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.192
I'm where I'm at.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.069
Just like the shell of an egg,

10:54.404 --> 10:56.488
a group is fragile
and needs to be handled with care.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.573
- Careful
- Goddamn it.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.784
Rainbow warriors, don't be afraid to touch,
rainbow warriors.

11:00.869 --> 11:04.079
That's it. Use each other's bodies to balance.
Yes.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.790
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, quit looking at me.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.918
I'm looking at the egg.
I'm looking up into the sky.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.838
Mmm. Okay? Was it that hard?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.631
I wasn't looking at you.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.175
- Come here.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.344
- Don't touch me.
- What are you doing, man?

11:18.428 --> 11:20.387
You just flinched. I'm not gonna hit you.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.805
Dawg, back up off of me.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.682
You're in my space,
and I don't feel safe with that.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.808
- You didn't feel safe?
- No.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.352
You don't feel safe? You think I felt safe...

11:27.395 --> 11:31.190
When you parked your car
in my garage last night? You didn't even ask.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.318
You probably wanted my sport wagon
up in your garage, okay?

11:34.402 --> 11:37.112
- You probably begged for it.
- You guys are both sickos,

11:37.280 --> 11:42.910
'cause you guys frickin' smashed your cars
into my very tender, very tight little garage,

11:42.994 --> 11:47.206
and then one of you hosed me down
right on the chest with freaking wiper fluid.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.916
Maybe it was both of you.
It seemed to be a lot.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.042
See, Adam I understand.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.586
He'll park his little Mini in any old garage.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.339
I have a very, very medium-sized sedan.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.384
I left my garage door open,
and you parked your car

11:58.468 --> 12:00.010
and left me with a leaky tailpipe.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.554
Leaky tail... That's disgusting.
What does that even mean?

12:02.639 --> 12:05.140
Was your butthole leaking today?
That's gross.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.060
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

12:08.144 --> 12:09.395
Alice, Alice, I got this.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.189
- Guys, you're on the same team. Stop!
- This team's over.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.650
Come on, rainbow warriors. Bring it in.

12:14.901 --> 12:15.984
Let's go talk this out.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.112
- Bring it in, come on.
- Yeah, stop, please.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.781
All right. What's the problem?

12:21.157 --> 12:23.659
- You know what, Teddy?
- What?

12:25.203 --> 12:28.872
We have... Some friends, right?

12:29.207 --> 12:31.417
And they live together,
and they work together,

12:31.501 --> 12:34.753
and they used to be
best friends until last night...

12:34.838 --> 12:37.423
What happened to these friends
of yours last night?

12:37.674 --> 12:38.715
Oh.

12:39.050 --> 12:42.636
The three friends
hooked up with each other hard.

12:42.846 --> 12:43.846
- Yeah.
- Once.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.014
Just one time, but a lot of butt stuff
and mouth stuff.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.350
Okay, well, I would tell, uh...

12:49.894 --> 12:51.353
I would tell your friends to get tested.

12:51.646 --> 12:55.065
I would also tell your friends to have
an honest, mature,

12:55.150 --> 12:58.735
adult conversation about what happened.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.238
Hey, listen, if your friends
want any more advice,

13:01.322 --> 13:03.532
just tell them to swing by my office.

13:03.825 --> 13:04.867
Teddy...

13:05.702 --> 13:06.702
We're talking about us.

13:12.876 --> 13:13.917
I'm tweeting that.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.669
I am tweeting that.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.087
Whatever, maybe he's right.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.631
Maybe we should have
an adult, mature conversation about it.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.384
Guys, bad news, but that...

13:22.760 --> 13:25.179
That tweet is gonna be
too many characters, so, uh...

13:25.513 --> 13:28.056
I'm just gonna throw it into drafts
and then circle back to it later.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.063
What

13:35.857 --> 13:38.650
As weird he is, maybe he's right.
Maybe we should talk about it.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.404
I know we don't like to, like,
freaking talk about, like,

13:42.489 --> 13:44.364
-real stuff, like secrets.
- Yeah.

13:44.449 --> 13:48.076
- We're dudes.
- But now we have a huge secret.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.372
Yeah, yeah. And, I mean, this is a secret
that we'll never tell anybody else, right?

13:52.457 --> 13:53.582
Nope, no.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.667
I'm gonna freakin' take this one
to my deathbed.

13:55.752 --> 13:56.835
Until we write our tell-alls.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.670
Yeah, or maybe it's just a tell-some.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.880
All right, I'm gonna tell a secret.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.799
Okay, remember that night when
we were watching Shallow Hal,

14:02.884 --> 14:04.927
and, like, I just wouldn't stop crying?

14:05.386 --> 14:06.845
- Yeah.
- Okay, it's not because

14:06.930 --> 14:09.973
-that movie is both hilarious and touching.
- It is.

14:11.434 --> 14:15.479
My uncle Howie died that night,
and, you know, we were really close.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.607
I really miss him, still.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.527
I know you guys didn't know,
but just having you there,

14:23.196 --> 14:24.446
it really helped me get through it.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.907
I think I might be the son
of my parents' gardener.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.286
I caught him and my mom together
when I was super young,

14:32.163 --> 14:33.956
and that means that

14:35.750 --> 14:37.209
I'm not 100% Norwegian.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.002
I'm, like, half

14:39.587 --> 14:40.963
German-Irish or something.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.216
- Irish.
- Yeah, it's all right.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.969
I know this is gonna be hard to believe, but

14:49.138 --> 14:50.806
I wasn't the coolest kid in school.

14:51.641 --> 14:55.060
In fact, I got beat up all the time.
I didn't have any friends.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.270
Probably 'cause of the way you run.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.479
No, not because of my run.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.605
- It's a weird run.
- No.

14:58.690 --> 15:02.025
And I think that's why I'm so addicted
to freaking having these gigantic muscles

15:02.110 --> 15:05.362
and being this freaking mountain of beef
you see before you today.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.447
I've never told anyone that.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.032
Wow. Uh...

15:09.492 --> 15:10.659
Okay, that felt pretty good.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.160
I felt something, yeah.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.246
Shake it out, shake it out.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.330
- Gross.
- Okay, whatever.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.585
Last night happened. That's in the past,
but I just know that I need you guys in my life

15:19.669 --> 15:22.671
for the rest of my life,
because you're my, like, rock, man.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.842
Hey. What do you guys say
we go get Palm Sprung!

15:26.926 --> 15:28.802
- Yeah, baby.
- Whoo!

15:28.886 --> 15:30.596
Okay, all right. We don't even need to do that.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.097
- All right, race you guys.
- Yeah.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.724
Oh, check it out, the run. The run.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.517
Wow.

15:35.852 --> 15:36.893
Race you!

15:37.103 --> 15:40.897
- Any questions?
- All right, we are ready to rock and jock.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.274
So how's this work?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.484
Just went through the whole thing.
I'm not gonna do that again.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.070
It's, uh... It's an obstacle course.
What do you want?

15:47.155 --> 15:48.780
All right, everybody line up.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.617
Whoo! It's go time. Hoo-ra!

15:51.701 --> 15:53.285
God, who gives a shit?

15:54.495 --> 15:56.538
You want to lay down and quit, go ahead.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.874
But I'm gonna finish this thing
through to the end.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.464
You're gonna wish you have never did that.

16:05.548 --> 16:06.548
Here we go.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.217
- Green team.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.887
You got this. Go, go, go, go.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.181
- Yellow team air horn.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.559
Everybody else, air horn!

16:20.897 --> 16:22.230
- Great form, Adam.
- Thanks, man.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.774
Learned it from watching you, dude.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.067
Oh, oh.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.069
I got you, big boy. I got you, big boy.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.488
Wait, Adam, wait.
My knees, they're too tender. I can't do it.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.032
- Here, use me as a human cushion.
- Okay, thank you.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.161
Looking good, guys.
Looking real good.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.082
They gaining on us. Go! Come on, Bill.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.918
- Come on.
- Yes!

16:43.670 --> 16:46.588
- Ow.
- That's it, rainbow warriors. That's it.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.756
Okay.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.675
God damn, Bill, why you so fast?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.094
Oh, that's high as shit.
How we gonna get that?

16:52.178 --> 16:53.178
Wait.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.721
Ah, man!

16:54.806 --> 16:58.517
Why don't you try shouldering
the burden of your teammates.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.478
I got it, human totem pole.
Let me up on your shoulders.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.356
Hell to the no, you're not putting
your stanky-ass balls in my face.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.692
- You don't wear underwear, Bill.
- It's not good for them.

17:06.776 --> 17:10.946
Remember teamwork builds trust,
and trust builds success.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.283
Adam. Your balls, my face, right now.

17:15.618 --> 17:16.702
That'd be a dream come true!

17:16.786 --> 17:18.078
- Come on.
- Yes!

17:19.038 --> 17:21.081
- Get it, get it.
- Great, great, great.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.916
I got it.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.836
Oh! I'm all about that bass.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.296
Okay, I'm gonna come up now.
All right, here I go.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.090
Get in there, rainbow warriors.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.216
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.634
We're using some
upper strength here.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.054
Okay, going up the next tier.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.974
- Oh, god.
- Just right there, bud.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.100
Oh, god!

17:40.184 --> 17:42.227
We're just gonna...
Whoo, you're tickling me.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.939
I need to go higher. Grab my butt. It's okay.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.567
Oh, god. Oh, god.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.861
- I got it!
- No!

17:50.945 --> 17:52.487
I got it! I got it!

17:52.572 --> 17:54.239
He got it.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.450
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

17:57.076 --> 17:59.828
We're going to Palm Springs.
Suck it, Tez. Don't really suck it, though.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.081
We did that. That's 'cause of you.
That's 'cause of you.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.458
Proud to be your friend.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.918
- I don't want this friendship to end.
- It never will.

18:07.003 --> 18:10.756
But, you know, you guys didn't have to go
face to crotch, face to crotch, face to crotch.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.674
You could've just done it from behind.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.135
- Been there.
- Shut up.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.645
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.648
Scott, the party toads are back.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.444
Hey, guys, we just
wanted to bring over a little, uh,

18:32.904 --> 18:35.197
peace offering for the way we acted
at the party.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.992
- We made it ourselves. You get that?
- Of course.

18:39.160 --> 18:44.039
So the butt sex we had at your party
the other night, we'd never done that before.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.042
We're not really three-way gay
or even gay at all.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.669
- Not even the short one?
- No.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.963
Yeah, you know, we're not gonna
ever do it again,

18:52.048 --> 18:56.510
but it did really bring us
closer together as friends, so...

18:57.720 --> 19:00.138
- Thanks.
- Oh, my god, we have to tell them.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.640
- No. No.
- Yeah, we have to tell them.

19:01.724 --> 19:05.060
- Tell us what?
- Nothing. Thank you for the cake. Bye.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.436
You didn't fuck each other.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.105
- We... No.
- No, we definitely did.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.982
We did. We did, in a real way.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.859
- Changed me forever.
- Dropped into each other.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.528
- That happened.
- No, you didn't.

19:15.488 --> 19:19.157
We staged the whole thing
because you were acting like drunken jerks.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.411
- But I had a condom.
- We put that in your butt with a toothbrush.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.833
But my knees were all...
And my jaw was really sore.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.334
I figured I had, like, three to four.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.711
You choked our bodybuilder friend Rog.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.464
He punched you in the face
and dragged you by the hair into that room.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.799
Rog? I thought we were friends.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.802
So the sticky stuff on my chest was just glue.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.679
- No, that was semen.
- Hmm?

19:40.763 --> 19:43.932
You were running around
our house, masturbating, saying,

19:44.100 --> 19:47.769
"I am the gayest of them all."

19:47.937 --> 19:50.647
And then you finished
on yourself, and you passed out.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.358
Yep, you know what?
I remember that. I did do that.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.318
- Yeah.
- Okay, wait, hold on.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.155
What you're saying is, that we did not
have sex with each other?

19:59.323 --> 20:00.907
- No.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.492
- Okay.
- Oh, my god.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.703
- Okay, wow.
- That's a relief.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.539
We're gonna head out then.
We're going to Palm Springs for the weekend.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.124
- Yeah.
- Us too.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.085
- We have a house down there.
- Yeah, we're having a big party on Saturday...

20:12.795 --> 20:13.962
- Oh, yeah?
- Huh.

20:14.505 --> 20:15.547
Yeah.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.550
You definitely shouldn't come by.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.761
- Joey.
- Yeah.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.141
Wow, they're having a party.
How are we not invited?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.976
- Right?
- How are we not invited?

20:28.519 --> 20:30.353
How are we not invited?

20:30.438 --> 20:32.314
How are we not invited?
Okay

20:32.398 --> 20:34.357
How are we not invited?
All right

20:34.442 --> 20:35.942
How are we not invited?

20:36.027 --> 20:37.569
How are we not invited?

20:38.029 --> 20:39.654
How are we not invited?

20:40.031 --> 20:41.823
How are we not invited?

20:42.033 --> 20:43.783
How are we not invited?

20:44.035 --> 20:45.660
How are we not invited?

20:45.995 --> 20:46.995
How are we not...

20:52.043 --> 20:53.585
Don't be scrambling around.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.253
I'm yoke-ing. I'm yoke-ing.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.505
Oh, egg-sellent. Egg-sellent.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.508
Egg joke. Boom. Yeah, there we go.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.428
Oh, yeah, oh.
Oh, look at the sunny side of this situation.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.598
You're winning. Yeah, egg joke. Boom! Boom!
