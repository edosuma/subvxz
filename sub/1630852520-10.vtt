00:01.769 --> 00:03.368
- I'm sending you on secondment
while we look into this.

00:03.437 --> 00:04.503
68 division.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.371
- Miss french,
I'm detective tara swallows.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.374
- Like the bird? I love birds.
- I do, too.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.642
<i> - Maybe she knows</i>
<i> more than she's saying.</i>

00:10.778 --> 00:13.011
- This woman needs a moment,
she's grieving.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.381
<i> - You have left behind</i>

00:16.450 --> 00:17.783
A great love.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.051
- Did you ever think
we gave up too quickly?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.654
<i> - I just want to make</i>
<i> sure that, like...</i>

00:22.790 --> 00:24.389
We're okay, right?

00:24.392 --> 00:25.657
- I'm a-okay.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.793
- I'll see you at work.
- I'll see you at work.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.328
- Richie, I'm trying
to help you.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.996
- You're the reason I'm in here.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.265
- I don't know what happened.
- Did he call his lawyer?

00:33.334 --> 00:35.300
- Yes, he did,
but I didn't get his name.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.336
He kept calling him "brother".

00:37.338 --> 00:39.104
- She gave me a usb.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.839
- My mother never
approved of me.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.340
If she could've chosen
a different daughter,

00:42.376 --> 00:43.409
She would have.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.277
- I think that's how
my daughter feels about me.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.713
- So, adeline has someone
inside covering her tracks?

00:47.848 --> 00:49.948
- Which means the oce
has a dirty cop.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.750
<i> - Michaels is losing it</i>
<i> right now.</i>

00:51.885 --> 00:53.185
He's locking everything down.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.027
(nathan): Do you need a hand
getting that down the stairs?

01:02.162 --> 01:03.428
(woman): No, no, I'm fine.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.096
I'm a bit of a pro,
but thank you.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.298
- You might need this, though.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.933
(chuckling)

01:09.570 --> 01:11.303
- Hey.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.571
What you doing here?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.105
- Oh, I got your message.

01:14.141 --> 01:16.641
It sounded urgent and you said
it was private, so...

01:16.710 --> 01:18.443
- You didn't have to come
all the way over here.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.846
But thank you.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.581
- Why don't you invite me in
for coffee, okay?

01:22.716 --> 01:23.916
- I, um...

01:24.051 --> 01:25.784
I'm still getting ready.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.420
(chuckles)

01:30.658 --> 01:34.593
I was wondering, do you know
how to remove a no-hit?

01:34.728 --> 01:37.862
Like, you know, if someone's
been flagged in the system.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.132
- Only the person or unit
that created the no-hit

01:40.134 --> 01:41.066
Can take it off.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.867
- So, how do I know
who created it?

01:42.903 --> 01:44.870
- Wait a minute,
what's this about?

01:45.739 --> 01:47.072
- Hmm, it's for an acquaintance.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.007
(chuckles)

01:49.076 --> 01:51.476
- What?
- No, I just...

01:51.545 --> 01:53.812
I don't know what I thought.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.881
Michaels is already up my ass

01:56.917 --> 01:59.618
For telling you and sam
about the inside man.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.621
I can't really be messing around
doing off the books favours,

02:02.690 --> 02:05.357
Because you have someone who
might be into something shady.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.425
- Oh, oh...

02:06.560 --> 02:09.494
He's not into anything,
trust me.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.162
- See you later.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.566
- So, you're not gonna help?
Nathan?

02:17.171 --> 02:18.370
(sighs)

02:18.439 --> 02:20.372
(soft music)

02:20.507 --> 02:22.340
- You know what's weird?
The database is down.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.675
I can't access anything.

02:23.711 --> 02:24.976
- Why are we on the outs

02:25.012 --> 02:26.778
While he's having
closed-door meetings

02:26.780 --> 02:28.380
With gabrielle and watts!

02:28.515 --> 02:30.115
The guy looks like he gets
dressed in the dark.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.950
- He was with adam gentle
when he was killed.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.585
I'm just saying.
- Exactly.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.453
Who's to say he's not the mole
that we're looking for?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.921
(door opens)

02:41.362 --> 02:43.195
Uh, commander, can we get
a minute of your time?

02:43.264 --> 02:44.996
Please?

02:45.065 --> 02:47.732
- Sir, we know that you know
that we know about the mole.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.534
- Yeah. And we can be
of use, sir.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.937
- Until you're both officially
cleared, it's need to know

02:52.006 --> 02:53.939
And thanks to ds greene,
you already know

02:54.008 --> 02:55.207
More than you need to.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.942
- Okay, but we are
the departmental leads

02:57.011 --> 02:58.343
On the coyotes
and adeline french,

02:58.412 --> 02:59.877
So if a dirty cop
is helping her,

02:59.914 --> 03:00.946
We actually do need to know.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.614
- If there's been
a security breach,

03:02.616 --> 03:04.082
I will notify you.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.684
- Pretty clear
there's been a breach.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.719
- Uh, no.
It's clear a thumb drive

03:07.788 --> 03:09.421
Containing evidence
was scrambled.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.956
We have to rule out an accident.

03:11.025 --> 03:14.492
Also, since this is a highly
sensitive investigation,

03:14.562 --> 03:16.562
The record-management system
will be locked down

03:16.697 --> 03:17.963
Until further notice.

03:18.032 --> 03:21.700
All guns and gangs requisitions
will go through acting ds watts.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.902
- Come on, there must be
something we can do to help.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.038
- Do your jobs.
Get some guns off the street.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.373
Or you know what?

03:28.442 --> 03:30.508
Work on yourselves a bit.

03:30.510 --> 03:33.712
Detective swallows is giving
a voluntary workshop today

03:33.781 --> 03:35.247
On mental health skills.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.448
- Swallows.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.916
- It explains why she's been
lurking around this week.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.453
- A pipe burst in
the multipurpose room in 44,

03:41.455 --> 03:45.857
So I'm sorry, but I've given her
the guns and gangs office space.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.060
- Uh...
- Wow. Great.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.227
(sighs)

03:49.997 --> 03:51.829
- Good luck.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.602
- He said this
was voluntary, right?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.137
- I believe he did.
- Cool.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.672
This is a dumpster fire!

04:00.708 --> 04:02.474
- Let's just focus
on what we do know. Okay?

04:02.543 --> 04:03.742
Whoever scrambled
the thumb drive

04:03.811 --> 04:04.743
Got it from evidence lockup.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.478
To get in there,
they need a key card.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.013
- Yeah, which means
our dirty cop

04:08.148 --> 04:10.015
Is one of the names
on that key card entry log.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.684
- Yeah, and log information
is kept in the database,
which means...

04:12.819 --> 04:14.719
- Look, digital is how
we got into this mess.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.289
I want to shift
all requisitions to paper.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.490
Dig up some old 289s.

04:19.526 --> 04:20.792
You writing this down?

04:20.927 --> 04:23.294
Come on, keep up.
Things are happening, here.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.229
I want to get the peanuts
in the vending machine.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.165
- We're screwed.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.301
- Unless we can find somebody
to go over watt's head.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.636
Someone that we trust,

04:31.672 --> 04:33.971
Someone with admin
security clearance.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.640
(hip-hop music)

04:35.643 --> 04:37.642
♪ thinking of a master plan ♪

04:37.678 --> 04:40.479
♪ 'cause ain't nothing but sweat
inside my hands ♪

04:40.481 --> 04:42.647
♪ so I dig into my pocket,
all my money is spent ♪

04:42.650 --> 04:43.715
♪ so I dig deeper ♪

04:43.717 --> 04:45.717
(record scratches)

04:45.753 --> 04:48.252
- So, you two are on my doorstep
for the second time this week,

04:48.289 --> 04:52.057
Because... You are expecting me
to drop everything,

04:52.126 --> 04:54.392
Because you want me to look
up some files for you.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.094
(overlapping chatter)
- I feel like you skipped over

04:56.130 --> 04:57.562
A lot of the relevant
information.

04:57.564 --> 05:00.098
- And you also want me to accept
this secondment position

05:00.167 --> 05:03.201
That I have been avoiding
for ages

05:03.270 --> 05:05.136
So that you can go
behind the back

05:05.172 --> 05:06.538
Of your commanding officer

05:06.607 --> 05:10.408
And interfere in a sensitive,
internal investigation

05:10.444 --> 05:13.412
That he specifically told you
to stay away from.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.680
- Yeah.
- Basically, yeah.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.350
That's correct.
- Summed it all up.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.185
(birds chirping)

05:23.123 --> 05:26.157
- Guess it's a good thing
I already accepted the job.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.094
(laughs)
- you what?

05:29.229 --> 05:32.497
- As much as I have enjoyed
sitting on my ass...

05:32.533 --> 05:33.698
(groans)

05:33.701 --> 05:36.501
Going undercover with zorka,
it just made me itchy!

05:36.503 --> 05:38.102
I gotta get back in the saddle.

05:38.138 --> 05:42.307
So, guess who starts
at 68 division next week?

05:43.310 --> 05:44.742
- I mean, you could have
told us that

05:44.778 --> 05:46.577
Before we started
our whole spiel.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.314
- Oh, I guess it's my flair
for theatrics.

05:49.449 --> 05:53.385
And my sincere desire
to avoid all fanfare,

05:53.520 --> 05:56.788
And all first-day-on-the-job
muffin baskets.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.724
You got that, wazowski?
- Well... Pfft.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.459
Co... Copy that.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.995
- But is there any way
that you can start earlier,

06:04.064 --> 06:06.063
Like, now?

06:07.334 --> 06:08.834
- I suppose I could tell them

06:08.836 --> 06:11.736
That I gotta get a jump-start
on the caseload?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.338
- Okay, thank you, thank you,
that would be wonderful.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.040
We really appreciate it...
- No, "thank you, thank you,

06:15.175 --> 06:17.676
We really appreciate it"
muffin baskets either, okay?

06:17.811 --> 06:20.478
- Okay, anyway, we will start
iding everyone at the oce

06:20.547 --> 06:21.946
That's connected to adeline
and the coyotes.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.015
- But for obvious reasons,
right,

06:24.017 --> 06:26.484
We can't run the operation
at the station,

06:26.553 --> 06:28.953
So we were hoping that maybe
we could do it...

06:29.022 --> 06:31.223
Oh, I don't know, here?

06:31.358 --> 06:33.258
(laughs)
here, yes, great idea.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.826
(laughs)
- no.

06:34.828 --> 06:38.163
No, because I have boundaries
and they are called elizabeth.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.432
I can't bring that sort of stuff
in our home,

06:40.501 --> 06:41.700
She would kill me!

06:41.835 --> 06:43.701
What's wrong with
one of your homes?

06:43.771 --> 06:44.636
- Uh...

06:44.705 --> 06:46.104
(both): Well...

06:46.239 --> 06:48.106
- I have bees.
- The ac's not working
at my place...

06:48.241 --> 06:51.709
- An infestation of bees...
In the walls.

06:51.711 --> 06:54.713
(overlapping excuses)

06:55.682 --> 06:58.249
- You begged me
on a weekly basis

06:58.285 --> 07:00.785
To come into your house,
but now, you got bees?

07:00.788 --> 07:02.453
- Listen, your ac
has never worked,

07:02.489 --> 07:04.389
Now it's an issue?
- At least I got a real reason!

07:04.524 --> 07:06.591
- I have a real reason!
I slept with steve, okay?

07:06.726 --> 07:08.827
And I hate myself for it,
but I really, really liked it.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.528
I slept with him once.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.629
Twice.
- Oh!

07:11.698 --> 07:12.997
- Thrice.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.199
- Oh.
- Several times, in fact.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.867
- Damn. Okay.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.135
Well, it's not like you and naz
were exclusive, right?

07:18.172 --> 07:19.938
- It's true. I mean, we never
actually said those words

07:20.073 --> 07:21.473
And he lied about angie,
so you know what?

07:21.608 --> 07:22.740
He could be sleeping with her.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.210
- Okay, but I still don't see
why we can't...

07:25.212 --> 07:27.779
Go to your crib.
- What, just bring naz over

07:27.781 --> 07:29.414
And pretend like nothing
happened? That's a great idea.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.015
Let's just sit naz there,
steve's gonna come and go,

07:31.051 --> 07:33.084
And my mother's gonna pour
gasoline on the whole thing.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.653
- Okay, fine. Bad idea.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.821
So, what you gonna do now?
- I don't know.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.424
I mean, I have really
journaled about it a lot

07:39.493 --> 07:41.893
And I just feel
even more stressed out.

07:42.028 --> 07:44.162
(sighs)
okay.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.897
Now, you go.
- Me go what?

07:46.032 --> 07:47.765
- Well, I told you my thing,
tell me your thing.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.401
Why can't we go
to your apartment?

07:49.403 --> 07:51.403
- It's not truth or dare.
I do not have a thing.

07:51.405 --> 07:52.436
- No, no, no!

07:52.473 --> 07:54.171
Yes, you do, yes, you do,
yes, you do.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.440
Oh, I see it.
(gasps)

07:55.575 --> 07:57.141
You've gone back
and you've slept with len.

07:57.211 --> 07:59.044
Oh my god, look at us,
a couple of backsliders.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.312
Wow!

08:00.447 --> 08:03.147
Hmm? Tell me I'm wrong.
- You're wrong.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.582
- Really?

08:05.719 --> 08:07.118
(door closes)

08:07.120 --> 08:08.720
(engine starts)

08:08.789 --> 08:10.855
- I'm so glad you could come.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.724
- Are you kidding?
How could I refuse?

08:13.760 --> 08:16.193
- Oh, book club was a snore.

08:16.230 --> 08:19.865
Uh, bait and switch
from discussing literature

08:20.000 --> 08:22.133
To a seminar on roberta's cats.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.804
So, we're having a do-over
and guess who's not invited?

08:25.806 --> 08:28.540
- My guess is roberta.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.942
- Honestly though, steve,
I asked you here today

08:31.077 --> 08:33.077
Because I met someone
who I think

08:33.113 --> 08:35.213
Would make a terrific
match for you.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.749
She's funny, sharp as a tack,

08:37.884 --> 08:40.151
Not to mention
drop-dead gorgeous.

08:40.153 --> 08:43.421
If you can't have samantha,
she's the next best thing.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.224
- I might not be giving up
on samantha just yet.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.859
- Really?

08:47.994 --> 08:49.227
(soft music)

08:49.362 --> 08:52.497
Oh, jesus! Was that you
sneaking out the other day?

08:52.632 --> 08:55.567
(doorbell ringing)
I want details!

08:55.569 --> 08:57.369
Oh, why didn't you tell me?!

08:57.504 --> 08:59.904
(laughs)

08:59.907 --> 09:01.840
- Hey!
- Hi, hi! Please, come on in.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.041
- Oh, thank you.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.176
- Just make yourselves at home
in the living room, there.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.178
- Thank you, welcome.
(sighs)

09:07.180 --> 09:08.913
- Just have a seat
on the couch, yes.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.682
Hi, yes!

09:10.751 --> 09:12.817
- Judes!
- Oh!

09:12.819 --> 09:13.918
(laughing)

09:13.954 --> 09:16.321
- Mmm! It smells like
we're doing it right, this time.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.922
There's no cat lady.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.191
- Oh! You kill me!
(laughs)

09:20.227 --> 09:23.695
Melanie, this is my...
Steve, my son in...

09:23.697 --> 09:25.063
My son.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.397
- Oh!

09:26.433 --> 09:28.466
They grow up so fast.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.267
- Nice to meet you, mel.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.405
If it's too bright in here,
I can dim the lights.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.073
- Oh, he's a gentleman, too.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.941
No, it's fine.
I'm gonna lose the shades

09:37.010 --> 09:38.376
Once the visine kicks in.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.144
Uh, I'm ready for that tour
you promised me.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.613
Although, I take it
your daughter

09:42.649 --> 09:44.683
Won't be joining us. Aw...

09:44.685 --> 09:46.418
What a beauty.
(laughs)

09:46.553 --> 09:50.288
You know, the rose don't fall
far from the bush, judy.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.689
(laughing)

09:51.825 --> 09:52.891
Just saying.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.759
Hey, where's this gorgeous

09:54.894 --> 09:56.160
Mysterious man
you wanted me to meet?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.229
- Actually, I don't think
that's gonna work out.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.698
- Why, is he a lawyer?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.832
- Yes, how did you know?

10:01.868 --> 10:04.102
(hip-hop music)

10:08.375 --> 10:10.175
- I know breakups are tough,
duff,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.577
But it's like a teenage boy
moved in around here.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.179
- Oh...

10:16.182 --> 10:17.315
Hey.

10:17.317 --> 10:21.052
I didn't think
you'd be back, yet.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.188
- So, a teenage boy did move in?

10:23.190 --> 10:25.924
- Just till I help him
find a job, okay?

10:25.926 --> 10:26.858
Hey, richie.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.126
- I'm sorry about the mess,

10:28.195 --> 10:30.128
I was gonna clean up
right before you got here.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.529
- Don't worry about it.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.531
- Richie, how's it going?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.666
- Alright.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.203
Uh... Things are just really
different with my crew.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.270
(fridge door opens)

10:39.272 --> 10:41.740
You know, it's all love
and it's fam always,

10:41.742 --> 10:44.876
But I'm just not trying to be
a waste yute, you know?

10:44.878 --> 10:48.146
- That must have been
a tough decision.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.681
Good for you, richie.

10:50.617 --> 10:51.816
- Yeah.

10:53.019 --> 10:56.354
- Kelly's helping me
with some job prospects.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.289
A program that she helped
put together.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.625
- Yeah, it's a youth job program

11:00.760 --> 11:02.927
The deputy mayor
is set up to help.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.496
I got a really good feeling
about this one.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.897
- Yeah, me too.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.366
- Yeah. You gonna be a'ight.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.901
(sighs)

11:12.906 --> 11:14.338
- Duff, you know
what this looks like, right?

11:14.408 --> 11:16.441
- Yes, yes, I know
what it looks like.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.309
If people knew
my teenage informant

11:18.311 --> 11:19.511
Was staying with me, a cop?

11:19.646 --> 11:21.412
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna
say anything.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.080
But you're right.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.249
(sighs)

11:25.285 --> 11:27.185
We can't work here.
- Mm-mm.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.024
We need somebody we can trust.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.459
Who lives alone.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.260
- Yes. No.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.063
- Yes.
- I feel like no.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.265
- Yes.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.666
- No.
- Yes.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.869
Yes.
- Please?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.339
(rhythmic music)

11:48.408 --> 11:50.608
(printer whirring)

11:59.252 --> 12:02.019
- I'm gonna make some tea
while we wait for the...

12:02.089 --> 12:03.688
Evidence key card log to print.

12:03.690 --> 12:04.822
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.157
- Okay.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.025
(groans)

12:08.862 --> 12:10.294
- Mm-mm.
(snorts)

12:10.330 --> 12:11.729
Mmm...

12:11.798 --> 12:12.897
(chortles)

12:13.032 --> 12:14.265
(chuckling)

12:14.301 --> 12:16.967
- You can't literally
laugh behind my back, okay?

12:17.003 --> 12:18.636
That's... It's...

12:18.705 --> 12:20.304
I know that this place
is embarrassing.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.706
- It's not embarrassing!
- This place is dope!

12:22.743 --> 12:24.842
(both): It's "chez naz"!

12:25.779 --> 12:27.178
- Okay, see now,
that's patronizing.

12:27.313 --> 12:28.780
It's hurtful and it's offensive.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.182
This is just a place
to rest my head

12:31.317 --> 12:33.217
While I get back
on my feet, okay?

12:33.253 --> 12:36.387
Let me tell you something.
Divorce sucks, okay?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.722
In fact, never get married.

12:37.857 --> 12:41.125
Also, been a pretty
crazy time at work. Alright?

12:41.194 --> 12:44.261
Also, I may have done
other stuff and so...

12:44.297 --> 12:46.464
It's just been really busy.
(kettle whistles)

12:46.599 --> 12:50.802
Okay? So, do you want
some tea, yes or no?

12:50.937 --> 12:52.470
(kettle continues whistling)

12:52.605 --> 12:53.605
(both): Yes.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.874
- I love tea, she loves tea.

12:57.010 --> 13:00.144
Okay, uh, so shanks
also sent over a list

13:00.213 --> 13:02.346
Of all the people who had access
to adeline's file.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.716
- Sweet. Anyone interesting?

13:04.851 --> 13:06.951
- We have michaels, nathan,
gabrielle, watts, swallows.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.521
- Swallows accessed
adeline's file

13:09.656 --> 13:12.490
Four times in the last two days.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.492
- Well, that's fair enough.
I mean...

13:14.561 --> 13:17.094
She is investigating the death
of adeline's brother.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.899
- But didn't she rule his death
as an overdose weeks ago?

13:20.901 --> 13:23.634
- Yeah. She's working
out of the oce this week

13:23.703 --> 13:24.769
In that seminar.

13:24.904 --> 13:27.371
- Oh, right,
that mental health thing?

13:30.377 --> 13:33.044
- So, swallows, the dirty cop?

13:33.113 --> 13:34.645
- Well...

13:35.448 --> 13:37.248
There's one way to find out.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.616
(rhythmic music)

13:38.751 --> 13:39.817
- No.

13:39.853 --> 13:40.851
- Yeah.
- Please...

13:40.887 --> 13:42.754
- Cheers to our mental health,
duff.

13:42.756 --> 13:43.855
- I'm with that.
- Yeah?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.056
- Yeah.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.727
- Mental health.

13:49.729 --> 13:53.798
From the latin "mens", for mind.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.201
The health...

13:56.336 --> 13:57.902
Of our mind.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.337
It's not that important.
Right or wrong?

13:59.472 --> 14:01.139
- Wrong!
- Exactly.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.506
(snickers)

14:02.542 --> 14:04.208
Is there a problem?

14:05.378 --> 14:06.911
- Yeah.

14:07.046 --> 14:10.048
Not enough people are taking
mental health seriously.

14:10.050 --> 14:14.485
- The things we see
in this job...

14:14.521 --> 14:16.020
Hold on.

14:22.896 --> 14:23.895
(boards creaks)

14:24.030 --> 14:26.898
The things we see in this job
can be tragic.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.766
They can be traumatic.

14:29.936 --> 14:33.504
It can feel like
we can't share these things.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.373
Take detective chase.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.076
He clocks in, 8 am.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.378
Bam, bam, bam! Bam!

14:41.414 --> 14:43.915
He sees four murders
by lunchtime.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.517
If he doesn't process
these feelings,

14:46.586 --> 14:50.321
They'll just keep building up.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.157
And when he finally
let's it all out...

14:53.159 --> 14:55.326
- You want me to...
- Go ahead.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.794
- I just had this dry-cleaned.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.729
- Is this workshop
a joke to you?

15:03.069 --> 15:04.735
(can fizzles)
- oh!

15:04.771 --> 15:06.638
- Exactly.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.939
Mental chaos.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.742
This job is hard.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.277
But we get through it

15:13.280 --> 15:15.879
Because we can count
on one another.

15:19.052 --> 15:22.954
We trust our colleagues
with our lives every day.

15:22.956 --> 15:27.024
And today, we're gonna trust
them with our feelings.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.693
Look around this circle.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.896
Each one of you sitting here
has secrets.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.966
And like a genie in a bottle,
we're gonna let them out.

15:34.968 --> 15:39.503
Now, I want you all to give
yourself a gentle caress.

15:39.539 --> 15:43.141
Remember, honesty starts
from within.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.076
We tell ourselves
that we're okay.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.912
We got dressed.
We made it to work, right?

15:47.914 --> 15:51.182
Well, that is a half-truth.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.584
And what is a half-truth?

15:53.720 --> 15:55.119
(light music)

15:55.254 --> 15:57.956
Repeat after me: A half-truth

15:58.091 --> 15:59.924
Is a whole lie.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.793
(all): A half-truth
is a whole lie.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.664
- Every second person,
look to your left.

16:06.733 --> 16:10.868
I want you to pair up
and open up.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.336
Full truths only.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.405
And commence!
(laughs)

16:14.407 --> 16:16.674
So, it's you two, then you two
and you two, and you two...

16:16.809 --> 16:19.010
Chase... You're very lucky,
and vice versa,

16:19.145 --> 16:20.844
To have chase.
- He's very lucky to have me.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.213
- Well, everybody's lucky here.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.483
- I should warn you,
I have a pretty straightforward

16:25.552 --> 16:26.417
Interior life.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.684
- I believe that.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.687
- So, did you want to go first,
or I get to go...

16:29.822 --> 16:31.355
- Angie came to see me.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.858
Like, a month ago,
at the hospital.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.093
Um...

16:35.228 --> 16:37.327
And I didn't tell you and I...

16:38.331 --> 16:39.730
Well, actually,
I full-on lied to you.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.199
- Listen...

16:43.436 --> 16:44.902
You're not over her.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.572
It... I get it.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.908
- No, no, no. No, no.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.978
I'm... Definitely over her.

16:54.047 --> 16:57.748
The lying was just this weird,
knee-jerk reaction

16:57.817 --> 16:59.784
And I don't even know
where it came from.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.652
And then, I wanted to tell you
about it afterwards,

17:01.654 --> 17:04.455
But then, I felt that if I did,
it was gonna be more of a thing

17:04.491 --> 17:08.192
And it's... Honestly, sam,
really not a thing.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.996
I went to her mother's
birthday party in stratford.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.865
So stupid. Uh...

17:14.000 --> 17:15.399
And I stayed over.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.935
At like, a b&b.

17:17.971 --> 17:20.338
It was by myself, obviously.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.005
Which is... That's still wrong.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.074
I definitely
should have told you.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.077
You're genuine, sam.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.880
You're really genuine
and I want to be...

17:29.015 --> 17:31.482
I want to be genuine, too.

17:31.617 --> 17:32.917
So, yeah.

17:32.986 --> 17:35.019
I totally understand
if you're, like, really mad--

17:35.154 --> 17:36.587
- I'm not mad.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.156
I'm good.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.226
You're good. You're so good.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.429
You're probably too good.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.831
(chuckles)

17:46.833 --> 17:49.300
- Oh, wow, that's...

17:49.369 --> 17:50.768
(sighs)

17:50.837 --> 17:54.038
Swallows. She's right, I mean...

17:54.040 --> 17:56.974
It feels like so much
better to get that out.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.377
(sighs)

17:59.379 --> 18:02.780
Is there anything that you
wanted to share too?

18:02.849 --> 18:04.382
I know about the secret smoking,

18:04.517 --> 18:05.783
So that doesn't bother
me at all.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.384
- Yeah.

18:07.386 --> 18:08.719
Uh...

18:10.924 --> 18:12.523
We're pretty much
like two open books.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.790
(chuckles nervously)

18:13.827 --> 18:14.992
- Okay.
- Yeah.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.426
(laughs)

18:17.664 --> 18:19.397
(laughing)

18:19.532 --> 18:21.999
- Here's a hint: You don't need
to read the book.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.267
Just look it up online.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.469
You get the gist of any story
in under five minutes.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.205
(judy): Steve, you are too much.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.940
- Uh, sorry, I just was curious

18:29.976 --> 18:32.210
As to why a man
who doesn't like reading

18:32.345 --> 18:33.544
Would attend a book club?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.480
- Trust me, I wouldn't have
graduated from law school

18:35.615 --> 18:37.681
Magna cum laude
if I didn't like reading.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.450
(steve laughs)

18:39.519 --> 18:41.418
Show me a book where I can't
predict the ending.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.155
I'll read it.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.456
- Can't imagine why
she would divorce you.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.693
- Sorry, I didn't catch that.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.395
- How is it that
you're divorced?

18:53.366 --> 18:54.832
- Well...

18:57.036 --> 18:59.636
I was not a good husband
the first time around.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.706
But I'm hoping
for a second chance.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.841
- What was she hoping for?

19:04.878 --> 19:07.144
Loyalty? Accountability?

19:07.147 --> 19:08.646
Self-respect?

19:10.650 --> 19:13.884
- What I meant was, I'd like
the chance to make her happy.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.921
I'd like to make good
on the promises I broke.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.589
- I know men like you.

19:19.526 --> 19:24.595
- Now, hold on...
- 160 pages.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.598
If you're such an expert reader,

19:27.733 --> 19:29.600
You could have been
through that in what?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.736
One trip to the toilet?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.604
But instead, you hijack
this gathering

19:33.640 --> 19:36.273
Of drop-dead gorgeous women

19:36.342 --> 19:38.542
And you impose on them
your patriarchal

19:38.545 --> 19:40.210
Controlling need to be
the centre of attention

19:40.246 --> 19:42.613
While you belittle and make
everyone feel inferior to you,

19:42.649 --> 19:45.149
While really, steve, you just...

19:45.284 --> 19:47.317
You could've simply read
the damn book.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.487
(light music)

19:50.557 --> 19:52.623
- Oh, everything okay?

19:53.626 --> 19:55.426
I was just about
to serve the fondue.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.661
- Let me help with that.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.629
- The powder room
is where, again?

19:58.764 --> 20:01.232
- Uh, just upstairs.
- Oh, lovely.

20:04.303 --> 20:07.238
- I know these people
are our colleagues, our friends,

20:07.373 --> 20:09.573
But one of them is corrupt.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.041
Stay objective.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.676
We have to look at this
from every angle.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.311
Any suspicious behaviour,

20:14.347 --> 20:16.714
Money trouble, substance abuse,

20:16.783 --> 20:20.050
Officers looking to cut corners,
asking for favours,

20:20.086 --> 20:21.552
Keep me posted, please.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.453
- Okay.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.557
- Please close the door.
- You bet.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.529
- You know, they can't
blame you for this.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.563
- It happened on my watch,
greene.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.134
If I get a sense
any personal entanglements

20:37.136 --> 20:39.070
Are holding you back
from this investigation,

20:39.072 --> 20:40.471
I have to take you off of it.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.775
- Man, I am as objective
as they come.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.011
- That's what I like to hear.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.415
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.086
(door closes)

20:55.955 --> 20:57.088
(sighs)

20:57.090 --> 20:59.423
- And then, yesterday was...

20:59.492 --> 21:00.891
(clicking tongue)
egg salad.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.159
No!

21:02.228 --> 21:03.894
Wait, that was Tuesday.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.296
(laughs)
- wow.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.764
- Woops.
- Oops.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.699
I'll go next, how about that?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.301
I heard the reason
they shut down

21:10.436 --> 21:13.070
Records management is they're
looking for a dirty cop.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.372
Know anything about that?

21:14.507 --> 21:18.642
- No. It was cybersecurity.
Hackers.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.577
- Huh.

21:20.647 --> 21:23.414
You sure you aren't
keeping anything in?

21:23.549 --> 21:25.583
It's hard to be honest
about some things,

21:25.718 --> 21:27.251
Like if...

21:27.253 --> 21:29.386
The truth would hurt someone,

21:29.422 --> 21:31.922
Or, you know, telling the truth

21:31.991 --> 21:34.058
Opens you up
to a whole bunch of things

21:34.060 --> 21:35.993
You're not ready to handle.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.994
Have you ever felt that way?

21:38.031 --> 21:40.531
- Not really. No.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.866
- No?
- Not at all.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.535
- Wait, not really
or not at all?

21:44.670 --> 21:46.203
- Never once. Both.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.906
- How about swallows there?

21:50.443 --> 21:52.777
You ever felt like she's not
being honest about some things?

21:52.912 --> 21:53.844
(chuckles)

21:53.979 --> 21:55.946
- Oh!

21:55.948 --> 21:58.215
(whispers): I wouldn't know
anything about that.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.350
- Are you sure?

22:00.386 --> 22:02.019
- No clue.

22:02.588 --> 22:03.821
(chuckles)

22:03.823 --> 22:05.555
I never heard anything
about a surprise party.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.558
But if she's asking,

22:07.627 --> 22:09.593
Definitely chocolate.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.163
- Great work, everyone.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.464
Let's take a quick break
before we switch.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.434
(sighs)

22:17.470 --> 22:20.771
- Oh my gosh.
I am seriously

22:20.773 --> 22:22.939
Beating a deceased horse
over there.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.243
We have to go
after her directly.

22:26.312 --> 22:27.778
If we have an odd number,

22:27.780 --> 22:29.380
She'll have to pair
with one of us.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.982
- Uh, hey.

22:31.984 --> 22:35.119
I don't think naz
can continue with the workshop,

22:35.121 --> 22:37.687
He has a really bad migraine.
It's off the hook.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.324
- Yeah, it's...

22:41.761 --> 22:45.830
It's definitely getting worse,
so I'm sorry, but I...

22:45.832 --> 22:47.198
I'm gonna have to call it.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.466
- For a headache?

22:48.468 --> 22:50.267
Mental health
doesn't take a sick day.

22:50.269 --> 22:52.002
- Huh?

22:54.140 --> 22:56.640
Okay, fine. Get out of here.
Feel better.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.610
(whispers): Lucky you.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.481
- Okay!
(laughs)

23:03.483 --> 23:06.684
Well, I guess it's just
you and me, yeah!

23:10.823 --> 23:12.756
(siren in the distance)

23:14.427 --> 23:17.428
- Let's dig deep.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.963
Remember, all the thoughts
and fears

23:19.999 --> 23:21.632
You're scared to share,

23:21.701 --> 23:22.967
They're okay.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.635
They're what make you sandra.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.904
- Samantha...

23:27.039 --> 23:30.340
- I see you, I accept you.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.110
Deep breath.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.112
(inhales)

23:35.247 --> 23:37.380
(exhales)

23:39.318 --> 23:41.117
Feels nice.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.654
- Wow, oh, uh...

23:43.723 --> 23:46.857
Tara, does anyone ever ask you
how you're doing?

23:46.992 --> 23:49.226
I mean, is there anything
you want to talk about?

23:49.228 --> 23:51.862
Is there anything
that you're keeping in?

23:52.998 --> 23:55.532
- And the student
becomes the master.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.669
I'm very open about my feelings.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.237
Uh, I'm pretty new with this,

24:00.306 --> 24:02.873
But I'm pretty sure
that's a half-truth.

24:02.875 --> 24:03.874
- Why would you say that?

24:03.910 --> 24:05.276
- Maybe 'cause I saw
your face twitch.

24:05.411 --> 24:07.644
- If my face twitched,
it was involuntary.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.447
(sighs)

24:10.582 --> 24:12.216
What do they call it,
hereditary trauma?

24:12.351 --> 24:15.819
Ironically, my mother taught me
that if I'm open and honest,

24:15.888 --> 24:18.088
My truth can be used
against me, so...

24:18.224 --> 24:20.157
I suppose I do keep
a few things hidden.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.892
- Oh, wow.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.094
Will anyone ever
see the real you?

24:24.230 --> 24:26.163
- It's true.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.164
When I meet someone, like...

24:28.201 --> 24:31.502
Lately, actually,
I act like I'm her rescuer,

24:31.504 --> 24:33.237
But really, I just wanted
her to rescue me.

24:33.372 --> 24:35.105
- She must have rescued you
a little bit.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.508
- I don't know.
I played it so cool.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.910
I led with my strengths,
which are plentiful.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.779
I think she saw me
as a sturdy raft

24:42.815 --> 24:44.515
To save her from a sinking ship.

24:45.918 --> 24:49.119
You never know when somebody
is telling you the whole truth.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.255
- Are you telling me
the whole truth?

24:53.493 --> 24:54.925
- She's the woman of my dreams.

24:54.961 --> 24:58.262
Smart, vulnerable,
a trained dancer.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.464
- You're kidding me.
- No, burlesque!

25:00.466 --> 25:02.098
Wow! Wow!

25:03.536 --> 25:05.202
But the truth...

25:06.005 --> 25:07.804
- Let it out, tara.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.874
- I don't know
if I can trust her.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.076
She's clearly lying
about a few things.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.345
I think she might be
seeing someone else.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.215
- I didn't mean to stir the pot.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.383
(chuckles)

25:19.452 --> 25:21.752
- No worries. In our days,
we called it flirting.

25:21.754 --> 25:25.088
- Well, maybe next time,
it could just be me and you.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.290
(laughs)

25:26.359 --> 25:27.891
- I would love that.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.827
- I will pick the book.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.161
But I'm going to read it first,

25:31.230 --> 25:33.063
Just to make sure
that it's juicy.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.308
- Hmm...

25:45.311 --> 25:47.177
(cellphone rings)

25:50.016 --> 25:51.948
Hello from limbo.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.851
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, shanks!

25:53.853 --> 25:55.052
- Hold on.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.120
- Swallows has the hots
for adeline.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.322
We think she's the dirty cop.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.990
<i> (kelly): You got that?</i>
- Swallows, huh?

25:59.992 --> 26:01.858
<i> - Yup. So, you need</i>
<i> to break into her office</i>

26:01.860 --> 26:03.059
<i> And see what you can find.</i>

26:03.996 --> 26:05.695
(light music)

26:14.674 --> 26:16.006
(chase): They're my
favourite pair.

26:16.141 --> 26:17.374
You didn't see them?

26:17.443 --> 26:18.976
(swallows): If I did,
I'd give them back.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.079
I don't understand how you keep
losing things like this.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.480
Inspector shanks!

26:23.482 --> 26:25.816
- Detective swallows, hello.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.784
- I can't believe this.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.689
(chuckles)
look at us, neighbours!

26:31.691 --> 26:32.890
- Oh!

26:33.025 --> 26:34.491
- It's an honour
to have you here, ma'am.

26:34.527 --> 26:35.625
- Oh, it is?

26:35.661 --> 26:37.161
- I wasn't going
to do this, but...

26:37.163 --> 26:38.896
When I first started,

26:38.898 --> 26:41.632
I didn't know how my colleagues
would be about, you know.

26:41.701 --> 26:42.700
Me.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.501
So, hearing a senior officer

26:44.503 --> 26:46.503
Talk so openly
about her wife, it...

26:46.505 --> 26:48.205
- Oh!
- It meant a lot.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.507
- It's nice.
- Wow. Well, I'm...

26:50.509 --> 26:52.175
I'm really glad to hear that.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.777
- Anything you need,
anything at all,

26:53.912 --> 26:55.045
We're right here.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.380
I'm an ace with the printer,

26:56.382 --> 26:58.515
Chase gives a very
thorough neck massage.

26:58.584 --> 27:00.651
He honestly should
do it for a living.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.452
- I thought about it.
(laughs)

27:03.389 --> 27:05.923
- Hey. You got a minute?

27:05.925 --> 27:08.625
- Not really. Busy day.

27:11.998 --> 27:15.131
- Okay.
It's on richie clarke, okay?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.134
The no-hit.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.402
I'm trying to help him
get a job,

27:18.537 --> 27:20.470
And I need it removed.

27:20.506 --> 27:22.939
- Look, it's not
a good time, right now.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.408
We're under a microscope.

27:24.543 --> 27:25.943
And anyway,
you shouldn't be interfering

27:26.078 --> 27:27.410
With someone else's
case like that.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.445
- What case?

27:28.580 --> 27:30.213
This is richie clarke
we're talking about.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.615
He wasn't involved in anything.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.184
- Well, if that's true,
then whoever's monitoring him

27:34.220 --> 27:35.486
Will realize that eventually.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.387
- Maybe, but the deputy
mayor sponsored

27:37.423 --> 27:39.889
That youth jobs program
in marshall court.

27:39.925 --> 27:42.760
He's applying today, nathan.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.962
- You can't just keep coming
to me for whatever you want,

27:44.964 --> 27:46.096
Whenever you want it.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.065
- I don't know why you're so
pissed off at me.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.400
You need to be pissed at
whoever put that no-hit on him.

27:50.403 --> 27:51.935
He's being profiled, nathan.

27:52.071 --> 27:55.772
- I do not need a lecture about
black boys and cops, kelly.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.374
I lived that.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.909
I lived that.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.912
I still do.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.914
That's exactly why
I can't be cutting corners.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.381
(telephone rings)

28:05.418 --> 28:07.918
Dirty cops, corruption,
I told you about all of it.

28:11.256 --> 28:13.123
I told you about all of that,

28:13.258 --> 28:16.126
Even though I knew
it was bending the rules.

28:16.261 --> 28:18.062
I felt like
I owed you something.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.930
But now, I'm not so sure
that's true.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.165
- Yeah, because I don't know
who I can trust.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.867
- Well, my name is not len.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.268
Alright?

28:26.672 --> 28:27.938
If you don't know
that by now,

28:27.940 --> 28:29.806
What the hell are we doing?

28:29.842 --> 28:31.174
- Nathan.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.743
Wait, where are you going?

28:34.513 --> 28:36.146
Nathan! Wait.

28:36.281 --> 28:37.581
Will you just...

28:37.583 --> 28:38.948
- Greene. Got something?

28:38.984 --> 28:40.150
- I do.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.419
I started going through
the evidence room logs...

28:42.488 --> 28:44.087
- Let's talk in my office.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.424
(light music)

28:52.631 --> 28:54.030
(door closes)

29:03.375 --> 29:04.708
Okay, update me.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.810
- Well, I was going through
key card records

29:06.879 --> 29:08.111
For our evidence room,

29:08.114 --> 29:10.747
And I came across a card
from 68 division.

29:12.118 --> 29:15.051
I wondered why someone from 68
would need access to our lockup.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.453
- Why indeed.

29:16.522 --> 29:17.987
Okay, let's bring him in.

29:18.023 --> 29:19.689
Quietly.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.458
(clears throat)

29:21.527 --> 29:24.261
Was it detective swallows?

29:24.396 --> 29:27.798
- No, actually.
It was detective chase.

29:31.337 --> 29:34.938
- Uh, yes, sir. Of course.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.740
I'll see you shortly.

29:43.716 --> 29:45.014
(sighs)

29:49.421 --> 29:51.688
(mysterious music)

30:00.566 --> 30:03.733
- Where would she keep
the damn key... Ah!

30:18.217 --> 30:19.415
Huh.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.652
- Hey! So, update.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.454
Big boss is working
on intel over at 68.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.122
So, really, it's only
a matter of time

30:26.158 --> 30:27.390
Before she puts the squeeze
on michaels...

30:29.962 --> 30:31.061
That's my diary.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.929
- Yeah, someone just
handed it to me.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.000
- This is private, naz.
This was on my bedside table.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.602
- Well, I didn't read it.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.470
A courier dropped it off
at reception

30:40.539 --> 30:42.005
Saying it was mine,
but then I opened it

30:42.007 --> 30:44.841
And saw your name,
didn't read any more.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.143
- A courier?
- Yeah, but sam,

30:47.145 --> 30:48.278
I'm telling you,
I didn't read it.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.613
- Okay.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.084
(sirens in the distance)

31:03.863 --> 31:06.663
- You planning on smoking that?

31:08.300 --> 31:10.033
- I just like holding it.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.502
For now, holding it
is good enough.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.573
Hey, duff?
- Yeah?

31:17.743 --> 31:20.009
- Someone dropped
my diary off at work.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.248
Then, whoever sent it
made sure it was given to naz.

31:25.851 --> 31:27.650
- Wow!

31:28.854 --> 31:30.186
Who dropped it off?

31:30.256 --> 31:31.921
- A courier.

31:32.892 --> 31:34.658
So, I know it was sent
from my house.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.928
- Judy?

31:39.264 --> 31:41.064
You think she's team steve?

31:43.202 --> 31:44.935
(light music)

31:47.873 --> 31:49.872
- I'm really glad
I have you, duff.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.111
- Me too.

31:56.214 --> 31:59.749
Just... Promise me
we'll always keep it 100.

32:00.519 --> 32:01.852
- Yeah.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.355
(sighs)

32:11.697 --> 32:12.996
- Oh!
- Hi!

32:13.032 --> 32:14.765
- You're back for round two
with steve?

32:14.900 --> 32:17.633
- Oh, he wishes. That was just
a first-round knockout.

32:17.670 --> 32:20.704
I... I think I may have
lost an earring.

32:20.773 --> 32:23.373
- Oh! No problem.
Come on, we'll find it.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.977
So, did you pick the book yet?

32:27.046 --> 32:28.979
- I found one,

32:28.981 --> 32:30.447
But the main character
turned out

32:30.449 --> 32:32.315
To be very disappointing.
I mean, she seemed like

32:32.318 --> 32:33.717
She'd have all
the interesting flaws,

32:33.852 --> 32:36.320
Like the kinds of weaknesses
you can just...

32:36.455 --> 32:38.855
Sink your teeth into, but...

32:38.924 --> 32:41.524
Turns out she's a real
goody-goody bore

32:41.560 --> 32:44.527
Who agonizes over
the tiniest little thing.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.897
- Sounds like we should
write our own.

32:47.032 --> 32:48.398
- Yeah!

32:48.434 --> 32:51.467
Yeah, like a good
woman-focused revenge tale

32:51.503 --> 32:54.738
Full of lust,
and intrigue, and...

32:54.873 --> 32:56.606
Threesomes, you know?

32:56.608 --> 32:57.874
(chuckles)
just fun.

32:57.910 --> 32:59.275
- Now, we're talking!

32:59.311 --> 33:00.944
- Where the protagonist
has been betrayed

33:01.013 --> 33:02.278
And seeking retribution.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.947
Unfairly persecuted,
her family targeted,

33:04.016 --> 33:05.348
She's just driven
to find leverage,

33:05.351 --> 33:09.686
So she inserts herself
into the life of her antagonist.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.955
- Oh, melanie,
don't make it too arch.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.290
- The thing is, the protagonist

33:14.326 --> 33:18.161
Has come a little bit too far
to turn back.

33:18.230 --> 33:21.230
So, really, her only option
is to just...

33:21.266 --> 33:24.934
Follow through and just take
something her adversary loves.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.638
- Sorry, my love,

33:28.640 --> 33:31.641
But weren't those the earrings
you were wearing?

33:33.312 --> 33:37.113
- Oh! Damn! Judes!
(laughing)

33:37.182 --> 33:38.981
Always the sharp one.

33:39.018 --> 33:41.117
(gasps)
- oh!

33:43.522 --> 33:44.854
Uh...

33:44.890 --> 33:46.456
(groans)

33:52.765 --> 33:54.797
- Oopsy daisies.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.206
<i> - Yesterday morning.</i>

34:03.208 --> 34:05.675
<i> I almost lost</i>
<i> my temp one today.</i>

34:05.744 --> 34:08.478
It was stupid of me,
but I didn't do anything wrong.

34:08.613 --> 34:11.214
I'm a really,
really honest person.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.382
T taught me that.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.085
Tara swallows.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.753
I call her t for short.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.555
T-bone.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.558
Because you know, she's a...

34:21.693 --> 34:23.025
She's my friend.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.394
<i> So, we have nicknames.</i>

34:24.396 --> 34:25.795
- Hmm...

34:25.831 --> 34:27.664
Geez, that must be
hard to watch.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.365
- I'm quite floored.
Shocked, even.

34:29.401 --> 34:30.434
To think that chase...

34:30.569 --> 34:31.701
<i> - How has your partner</i>
<i> been lately?</i>

34:31.770 --> 34:33.903
Weird behaviour?

34:33.972 --> 34:35.505
- No.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.842
I mean, except for
the surprise party.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.243
It's my birthday tomorrow

34:40.279 --> 34:42.379
And she keeps asking me
to stay away from her desk.

34:42.381 --> 34:44.914
Can't believe she actually
remembered, for once.

34:44.950 --> 34:47.551
- Oh, that is so sweet.
When is the party?

34:48.887 --> 34:51.053
- I mean, I did know that
he had a birthday coming up.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.256
You know, like everyone else.
It's annual, so...

34:53.391 --> 34:56.126
- Doesn't sound like
you had much planned, so...

34:56.261 --> 34:58.128
Why keep him away
from your desk?

34:58.263 --> 34:59.395
- I keep pornography in there.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.831
- She's been my partner
since day one,

35:00.966 --> 35:02.465
My first for everything.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.369
Non-sexually, of course.

35:07.473 --> 35:08.204
<i> (nathan): You say you're</i>
<i> an honest person.</i>

35:08.340 --> 35:09.473
- Non-sexually, of course.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.341
- How can you just sit here
and watch him suffer like that

35:12.377 --> 35:13.743
For something that you did?

35:13.812 --> 35:15.679
- Come on, tara.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.213
T!

35:17.950 --> 35:20.550
T-bone! Huh?

35:20.586 --> 35:22.652
You showed us what happens
when you don't release.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.955
When you let things brew inside.

35:25.991 --> 35:27.557
You have only one way

35:27.626 --> 35:30.560
For it to come out
after that, right?

35:30.562 --> 35:32.495
(imitates can exploding)

35:36.435 --> 35:38.969
(indistinct conversation
in the interrogation room)

35:41.507 --> 35:43.106
- Okay, I took chase's key card.

35:43.108 --> 35:45.441
I'll tell you everything,
just get my guy out of the box.

35:45.511 --> 35:46.976
He has nothing to do with it.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.380
At first, I didn't buy it.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.448
But then, there was something
fragile about her.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.383
Something scared, so when
she asked for my help,

35:54.419 --> 35:55.518
I couldn't say no.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.387
- So, what did adeline
ask you to do?

35:57.522 --> 36:00.457
- The thumb drive in evidence,
she wanted me to get it for her.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.925
- I knew it was stupid, but...

36:01.927 --> 36:03.927
- But you used your partner's
key card instead of your own.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.929
Right?

36:05.931 --> 36:07.731
You weren't that stupid.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.065
You framed him.

36:09.134 --> 36:10.600
- No, I...

36:10.735 --> 36:12.068
- Hmm?

36:12.104 --> 36:14.237
- I guess, yeah.
- Then you took the thumb drive

36:14.373 --> 36:16.273
And scrambled the data on it.
- No.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.208
No, she asked for photos.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.476
Photos of her recently
deceased brother.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.812
Or at least,
that's what she told me.

36:24.082 --> 36:26.148
But I needed to know for sure,
so I took a look.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.950
It was encrypted.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.118
- So?

36:29.154 --> 36:31.955
- So, I realized that either
it was the wrong drive

36:32.024 --> 36:33.756
Or she was playing me.
I put it back.

36:33.825 --> 36:34.891
- You just put it back?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.559
Just like that?

36:37.429 --> 36:38.762
You didn't do anything to it?

36:38.897 --> 36:42.032
You didn't use a file-scorching
worm virus or anything?

36:42.167 --> 36:44.066
- Of course not, no, I...

36:47.772 --> 36:49.772
Those things usually come
on a usb, right?

36:49.808 --> 36:52.242
I'd need a whole other
thumb drive with a virus on it

36:52.377 --> 36:55.178
And plug them both
into the same computer.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.113
Well, look at the usb
history on my computer.

36:57.182 --> 36:59.181
You'll see I haven't plugged
anything else in there all week.

37:04.289 --> 37:07.123
- It looks like tara's
usb history checks out.

37:07.159 --> 37:09.526
There's no sign of her
introducing another thumb drive

37:09.528 --> 37:11.461
Or anything that could
host a virus.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.798
- You're saying
it might not be her?

37:18.336 --> 37:20.470
- I think we've been coming
at this the wrong way.

37:22.607 --> 37:24.341
We need to find that worm drive.

37:26.511 --> 37:29.012
- Find the virus...

37:29.081 --> 37:30.746
Find the dirty cop.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.490
(clears throat)

37:42.261 --> 37:44.360
- Okay, sam.
What are we doing here?

37:44.496 --> 37:45.462
(sighs)

37:45.464 --> 37:47.063
- I need you...
I need to get through this,

37:47.065 --> 37:48.832
So you just can't talk,
you can't say anything,

37:48.834 --> 37:50.500
You just have to listen
or else I'm gonna throw up

37:50.569 --> 37:52.669
Before I finish, okay?

37:52.671 --> 37:53.503
- Okay.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.538
- I had intercourse with steve.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.442
But like, sexually speaking.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.512
(sighs)

38:02.581 --> 38:04.247
(cars wooshing by)

38:06.785 --> 38:08.584
I'm so sorry.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.524
I just saw you
in the hospital with angie.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.728
And then, I heard you guys were
gonna go to stratford together,

38:18.764 --> 38:20.730
So I was just really hurt.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.598
I was really confused.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.937
I'm just really insecure.

38:31.876 --> 38:33.876
I just don't think
that I'm good enough.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.445
For you.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.088
Oh my god.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.024
I didn't do it to hurt you.
That's not what I did.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.959
I didn't do it
to get back at you

38:50.028 --> 38:52.095
Or anything like that,
that's not what I... Was doing.

38:52.230 --> 38:55.197
I think we need
to revisit some...

38:55.233 --> 38:57.434
...Chapters in our lives and...

38:57.436 --> 38:59.668
I'm just looking
at my chapter, I just...

39:00.472 --> 39:02.238
I have a lot more unresolved--

39:02.307 --> 39:03.373
- Looks like we found our mole.

39:04.376 --> 39:05.941
(panting)

39:07.179 --> 39:08.511
<i> (kelly): Does anyone care</i>
<i> to fill me in</i>

39:08.547 --> 39:10.146
<i> On why I'm in the hot seat</i>
<i> right now?</i>

39:10.215 --> 39:12.081
- Nathan, what the hell
is going on?

39:13.518 --> 39:16.052
Why is michaels
interrogating duff?

39:16.121 --> 39:17.787
- Nothing I could do.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.955
(dramatic music)

39:28.533 --> 39:30.667
<i> - Do you know why</i>
<i> you're here today?</i>

39:30.669 --> 39:32.568
<i> - No idea.</i>

39:32.570 --> 39:34.871
- We found something
in your locker

39:34.940 --> 39:36.606
That we're concerned about.

39:38.543 --> 39:39.609
(sighs)

39:39.744 --> 39:42.679
- Why was my locker searched?

39:42.681 --> 39:45.682
- After examining
everyone's usb history,

39:45.684 --> 39:49.018
There was a hit in your activity

39:49.154 --> 39:50.753
That warranted a search.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.022
(sighs)

39:54.092 --> 39:56.258
That's when a thumb drive
containing a virus

39:56.294 --> 39:58.594
Was found in your locker.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.333
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

40:09.908 --> 40:11.441
(soft music)

40:13.078 --> 40:14.577
Okay.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.480
I'll handle it over
to detectives lafford and harmon

40:17.615 --> 40:19.849
From professional standards.

40:19.984 --> 40:22.184
(chair scraping)

40:28.326 --> 40:31.460
- You of all people know
that duff didn't do this.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.329
- I know that!
- You know that?

40:33.398 --> 40:35.198
- Of course, I know that!
- You know that?

40:35.333 --> 40:37.066
- I already told you,

40:37.202 --> 40:39.068
I was with my partner,
samantha wazowski,

40:39.137 --> 40:40.670
Working this exact same case

40:40.739 --> 40:42.806
That y'all are screwing up
right now.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.741
- I take it detective wazowski

40:44.876 --> 40:47.076
Can account for all
your movements yesterday?

40:47.145 --> 40:50.079
- Are you asking if we went
to the bathroom together?

40:50.148 --> 40:51.413
- Okay.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.949
Well, it looks like
your key card

40:52.951 --> 40:54.484
Was used to enter
evidence lockup.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.285
And both the thumb drive
from evidence

40:56.321 --> 40:58.288
And the thumb drive
with the worm virus

40:58.423 --> 41:00.156
Were used at your
computer terminal.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.226
- Michaels is so far up
my ass right now,

41:03.295 --> 41:05.828
If I do anything to interfere
with the investigation,

41:05.897 --> 41:08.031
Anything, he will
take me off it.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.698
Or worse! I get suspended.

41:09.734 --> 41:12.468
And then, what good am I to--
- she'd know where you stood!

41:16.007 --> 41:17.307
That's what good you'd be!

41:17.442 --> 41:19.808
<i> - Look. I told you</i>
<i> everything I know.</i>

41:20.578 --> 41:21.845
Am I free to go?

41:21.980 --> 41:24.179
- Absolutely. Wouldn't want
to keep you here.

41:24.216 --> 41:25.548
It's just...

41:25.617 --> 41:28.384
- You're gonna have to surrender
your badge and your gun.

41:29.488 --> 41:32.655
- We have to suspend you
while we investigate.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.357
(scoffs)

41:37.963 --> 41:40.063
- You're gonna stand there
and let them treat me

41:40.065 --> 41:41.931
Like I'm some kind of dirty cop?

41:42.066 --> 41:43.866
(door closes)
- wazowski?

41:43.935 --> 41:45.668
- If you're calling
my partner dirty,

41:45.670 --> 41:47.136
Then you're calling
me dirty, too.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.672
- Wazowski, stand down.
This is your official warning.

41:49.807 --> 41:50.940
- Sorry, sir.

41:51.075 --> 41:52.775
But as long as you continue
to hold detective duff

41:52.844 --> 41:54.010
On these sham accusations,

41:54.079 --> 41:55.144
I'm not going anywhere.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.512
(kelly): You don't have
to do this.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.081
- I'm just letting you know
where I stand.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.817
- Wazowski. Back off.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.852
- I'll back off
when you back off.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.220
- Last warning, detective.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.488
- If you think
she's a dirty cop,

42:05.623 --> 42:07.690
Then you're an even bigger
idiot than I thought.

42:07.825 --> 42:09.758
- You're on administrative leave
until further notice.

42:09.794 --> 42:11.461
- That's... With pleasure.

42:11.596 --> 42:13.495
Sir.

42:13.532 --> 42:16.766
- Not to me,
go find the desk sergeant!

42:23.008 --> 42:25.574
Sorry, that's a stunning
pantsuit, by the way.

42:25.610 --> 42:26.909
(light music)

42:26.912 --> 42:28.044
(door buzzes)

42:29.347 --> 42:30.679
(door closes)

42:32.584 --> 42:35.117
- Don't worry, your daughter's
not expecting you home.

42:35.153 --> 42:36.953
You're out getting lucky.

42:37.756 --> 42:39.923
Niccolo, let's go already.

42:40.058 --> 42:41.557
- Whatever you need, baby girl.
