WEBVTT

00:10.135 --> 00:12.137
[loud rumbling]

00:17.142 --> 00:18.601
[silence]

00:18.685 --> 00:19.519
[Niko gasps]

00:23.064 --> 00:25.066
[instruments whirring softly]

00:28.153 --> 00:29.612
[door opens]

00:32.323 --> 00:33.158
What?

00:34.367 --> 00:36.911
No, no. I gave you
plenty of time to get out.

00:36.995 --> 00:37.954
[sighs] You did.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.789
Then what the fuck
are you still doing here?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.833
Iara trapped me this side.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.626
Iara?

00:45.462 --> 00:46.463
[laughs]

00:46.546 --> 00:49.299
Of course she did!
Because you tortured her!

00:49.382 --> 00:52.010
-[laughing]
-Yeah, well, she is half Achaian, so…

00:54.429 --> 00:55.513
[sighs]

00:57.307 --> 00:59.184
It may not be the worst thing though.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.062
-Niko, it's okay, you don't have to--
-No. I'm serious.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.273
I think I have a plan.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.444
[Mackenzie] Why this spot
to release the Achaian orb?

01:09.527 --> 01:12.822
[Erik] Well, look around you.
There used to be a smelter here.

01:13.323 --> 01:17.202
Then the premature births started,
the weird respiratory problems,

01:17.744 --> 01:19.287
weird cancers.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.332
It's been gone a few years.

01:22.832 --> 01:24.459
[Mackenzie] We won't be killing anything?

01:24.542 --> 01:27.045
[Erik] Nothing
that's not already dead, no.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.255
[Singh] 2.6 kilometers from base.

01:29.756 --> 01:30.590
[Erik] Yeah.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.675
Should be a safe distance.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.803
[Seth] Drop it in there?

01:35.345 --> 01:36.429
[Erik] Uh…

01:36.513 --> 01:38.723
Yeah. When we're back at base camp.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.934
Then apocalypse. Right, Singh?

01:41.601 --> 01:43.770
If it ignites our atmosphere, sure.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.190
We could also open a rift in space-time
that allows the Achaia

01:47.273 --> 01:51.319
-to invade our planet--
-We've-- we've taken all the precautions.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.863
[radio chatter]

01:57.117 --> 01:59.327
Ready to show us your secrets?

01:59.828 --> 02:03.206
I'm ready to get out of this soup
before it eats through my waders.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.707
-[bleeping]
-[air hisses]

02:04.791 --> 02:07.043
All right. Locked and loaded.
Let's clear out.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.129
[bleeping]

02:12.924 --> 02:14.843
[bleeping]

02:16.136 --> 02:17.303
Moment of truth.

02:18.096 --> 02:18.930
On your go.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.516
All right. Dropping… now.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.375
[computer beeping]

02:49.210 --> 02:52.797
I'm picking up surface waves,
emanating from the drop zone.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.259
Yeah, all magnitudes are below a three.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.511
Tremors are slight.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.346
Feel them?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.557
[low rumbling]

03:03.141 --> 03:04.851
-[loud rumbling]
-I felt that.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.940
-What do you think's happening?
-[alarm bleeping]

03:11.691 --> 03:12.692
[Erik] I don't know.

03:13.401 --> 03:16.738
I'm not sure, but the Achaia
aren't known for their subtlety.

03:24.037 --> 03:24.913
Everyone!

03:25.538 --> 03:26.706
Oh, Jesus!

03:29.667 --> 03:31.669
[heavy rumbling]

03:36.633 --> 03:38.343
[rumbling subsiding]

03:44.098 --> 03:46.100
[insects buzzing]

03:47.227 --> 03:49.229
[leaves rustling]

03:57.987 --> 03:59.822
[birdsong]

04:25.848 --> 04:28.601
[Singh] Shouldn't we send
a drone out first, or at least suit up?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.478
[Amos] Good idea.
There might be poison ivy.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.982
Ah, if there's any alien toxins,
we've already been exposed.

04:34.065 --> 04:34.941
[device whirring]

04:35.525 --> 04:38.278
An entire forest.
Mature growth for miles, just…

04:39.737 --> 04:40.863
out of nowhere.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.077
There's zero contaminants in the soil.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.288
I lived in Colombo

04:48.371 --> 04:51.040
and led a bioremediation project there
for a start-up.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.543
We invented a chemical compound
that was able

04:53.626 --> 04:56.379
to break down petroleum hydrocarbons
at an accelerated rate.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.675
Took 12 months
for us just to get grass to grow again.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.051
This-- this is…

05:02.135 --> 05:03.344
This is a gift.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.723
"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts."

05:07.307 --> 05:09.851
-Maybe they're not our enemies.
-So, they're our new best friends?

05:09.934 --> 05:12.770
What Nani is saying
is that this is incredible.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.606
But is it really worth
never leaving our solar system?

05:16.190 --> 05:19.610
Well, if this is what the Achaians
are offering, then why bother?

05:19.694 --> 05:21.446
[Erik] Overpopulation, for one.

05:21.529 --> 05:25.533
Colonies on Mars are well and good, but
what humanity really needs is a new home.

05:26.534 --> 05:27.535
New homes.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.413
That would take decades to establish.

05:30.496 --> 05:34.459
When what the Achaia are offering
will improve the lives of billions now.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.837
Tell me, Erik, how are we supposed
to say no to that?

05:41.257 --> 05:44.469
[Amos] A miracle is an event
that violates the laws of nature.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.221
So many days, we are just collecting data,

05:47.305 --> 05:50.600
but today, we got
to witness something special.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.563
120-year-old cedars grow in seconds?

05:55.646 --> 05:59.192
-Pretty fucking cool.
-Or it's a pretty cool magic trick.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.278
Yeah. Laying it on a little thick there.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.322
Oh, like, "Greeks bearing gifts?"

06:05.031 --> 06:06.949
Ooh. Now we won't
get to fuck up the galaxy

06:07.033 --> 06:09.035
-the same way we fucked up Earth.
-Really?

06:09.535 --> 06:11.037
You think humans would be better off

06:11.120 --> 06:13.748
with the paternalistic guidance
of an advanced alien species?

06:13.831 --> 06:16.626
Yeah. I'd like the oceans not to be acid,
the ice caps back.

06:16.709 --> 06:21.255
Oh, and Australia to be habitable again,
as does 99.9% of everybody else.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.385
Okay. Well, then 99% of people
are short-sighted.

06:25.468 --> 06:29.555
-My goddess, you're a snob.
-Listen. You both are right. Okay?

06:29.639 --> 06:31.099
The Achaians can save the planet,

06:31.182 --> 06:33.643
and it feels like
we might have new landlords.

06:33.726 --> 06:34.977
Doesn't matter, anyways.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.397
'Cause we're not the ones
who decide on their offer.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.731
[alarm siren blares]

06:41.567 --> 06:42.860
What now?

06:49.784 --> 06:52.662
-Ohh…
-There's an anomaly in the Jovian system.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.415
What the hell is that?

06:56.040 --> 06:59.419
-What's the situation, Erik?
-A massive energy buildup past Jupiter.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.629
-Of what, we don't know.
-If you had to guess?

07:01.712 --> 07:04.132
-A wormhole?
-A wormhole?

07:04.215 --> 07:05.716
I mean, we use wormholes all the time.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.178
It's how we're receiving a live feed
from over 700 million kilometers away.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.013
Yeah. But those are micro wormholes.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.598
-[Erik] Yeah.
-Nothing like this.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.559
What if the orb was a distraction?

07:14.642 --> 07:16.185
While we're admiring all the new trees,

07:16.269 --> 07:19.355
a whole fleet of Achaian ships
are coming towards us?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.316
I need to call upstairs.
He'll want a threat assessment.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.944
I'm picking up an instability
within the anomaly.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.779
Yeah.
The source appears to be blueshifting.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.365
[Amos] Something is making its way
through the wormhole.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.576
Whatever it is, it's heading our way.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.911
[energy roaring]

07:38.749 --> 07:40.668
[Cas] William, stabilize us.

07:40.751 --> 07:44.046
The tidal force of the wormhole
is pullin' on us in every direction.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.592
The FTL rings are bein' crushed against
its edges. The torsion is increasin'.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.053
[metal tearing and screeching]

07:52.430 --> 07:56.726
Negative mass can't hold the throat
of the wormhole open. It's collapsin'.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.561
[rattling]

08:05.067 --> 08:05.985
[bleep]

08:06.569 --> 08:09.405
-Wait. Where'd it go?
-Is there a problem with the signal?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.991
No. All the feeds are fine. It collapsed.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.451
Did anything make it through?

08:14.035 --> 08:15.369
Uh…

08:17.455 --> 08:18.706
[engines quietening]

08:32.678 --> 08:33.513
Where are we?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.892
We're in an orbit around Jupiter.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.145
Wait. We made it?

08:41.646 --> 08:42.897
We made it.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.023
[Bernie laughs]

08:45.399 --> 08:47.944
-[Bernie sighs]
-Where's Richard?

08:50.238 --> 08:52.156
I'm not reading any sign of him.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.828
You're saying he's gone?

08:59.288 --> 09:00.289
Like Niko?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.168
[William] Uh--

09:06.170 --> 09:07.380
With your blessing, Cas,

09:07.463 --> 09:10.591
-I'd like to open comms with Earth.
-No. Do not. That's an order.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.344
-But our mission's--
-Exactly.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.223
Our mission is to get our intel
into the right hands.

09:17.306 --> 09:20.893
Look, we have no idea what's been going on
on Earth since we left.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.522
So, until we do,
we have to proceed with caution.

09:25.022 --> 09:28.067
They will detect us.
If they haven't already.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.488
-Make sure that they don't.
-Yes, Cas.

09:34.865 --> 09:40.162
Today we witnessed an entire… ecosystem

09:40.246 --> 09:42.456
sprout out of nothing in-- in seconds.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.875
I mean, Achaian technology

09:44.959 --> 09:47.295
-is leaps and bounds beyond…
-[static crackles]

09:47.378 --> 09:49.046
what humans are capable of.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.507
We asked the Achaians
to prove their good intentions.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.677
I'd say they did.
Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Wallace?

09:55.928 --> 09:58.848
Well, it's pretty hard to disagree.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.350
[Cas] End playback.

10:06.355 --> 10:09.567
That was broadcast
to the Martian colonies eight hours ago.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.360
William picked it up.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.446
Thank God Niko can't see this.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.574
-[Bernie] We're too late.
-We're not. Earth's still here.

10:17.241 --> 10:20.328
But the Achaian charm offensive
seems to be working.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.371
So… we need a plan.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.751
First, let's cloak all the data

10:26.834 --> 10:29.879
that we found on weaponizing neutrinos
against Achaian tech.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.298
Only my bio-signature
can open those files.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.134
USIC will still know
the Salvare visited a magnetar

10:35.217 --> 10:37.511
and that you encountered
a damaged Achaian ring.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.472
And that's all they need to know.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.724
What I wanna know is,

10:41.807 --> 10:44.852
are they gonna see us returning
as enemies or heroes?

10:46.395 --> 10:49.774
Can Iara tap into the Artifact
like she can the Achaian rings?

10:50.608 --> 10:51.651
[Bernie] Where is Iara?

10:53.152 --> 10:54.904
Iara, can you join us, please?

10:55.404 --> 10:57.490
God, don't tell me we lost her too.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.660
No, that's impossible.
She's stored within our half of the ship.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.662
She's in the particle accelerator.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.789
Iara, join us now. That's an order.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.501
William, what's going on?

11:09.585 --> 11:10.586
[sighs]

11:12.922 --> 11:14.882
[breathes deeply]

11:19.303 --> 11:22.807
Hey. Niko chose to sacrifice herself.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.975
-Richard had no say.
-I know. I know!

11:25.059 --> 11:28.270
I thought I'd forgiven him
for interrogating me and torturing me.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.439
I-- I actually admired him. I--

11:30.523 --> 11:34.527
-He's the reason we're going home.
-He'll die out there 'cause of you.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.861
Why would I do that?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.780
I wouldn't. I couldn't. I--

11:38.447 --> 11:39.782
That's not me.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.702
-I want her contained.
-The firewall's already up.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.995
It's the first thing I did
when I realized--

11:45.079 --> 11:46.831
[whirring]

11:46.914 --> 11:50.584
[distorted] Wanna know what Richard looked
like when he realized he wasn't coming?

11:52.294 --> 11:53.337
First, panic.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.256
Then confusion.

11:57.341 --> 12:01.011
-Then when he realized he was gonna die…
-What is happening to you?

12:02.346 --> 12:05.725
[gasps] I don't know. Don't trust me.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.144
I can't trust myself.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.771
-[sobs]
-Guys, look at this.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.106
[whirring]

12:12.189 --> 12:13.899
This is her last diagnostic.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.277
The Achaian coding is on the right.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.695
This…

12:22.366 --> 12:23.200
this is now.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.118
Jesus.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.328
It's spreading.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.664
It's consumin' her.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.125
I can try and stop it.
At least see if I can slow it down.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.376
-And maybe--
-[gasps]

12:33.711 --> 12:35.838
[distorted] I should have killed you too.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.923
Or cut off your other leg.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.719
You hurt me. Kept hurting me.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.890
Watched me beg
while you still did nothing.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.685
Your behavior's repugnant
'cause your bodies are weak.

12:49.769 --> 12:55.399
Just skin and secretions, pissing
and shitting until you finally die.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.111
-Try to save her.
-Save her? What the fuck for?

12:59.195 --> 13:03.699
Because she's our only shot at reopening
that wormhole and saving Niko and Richard.

13:08.537 --> 13:09.997
[door opens]

13:11.916 --> 13:16.253
I mean, as far as I can tell,
nothin' came through that wormhole.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.965
So, you're saying this
is some kind of intergalactic crank call?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.217
No, I'm not saying that.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.511
The White House needs to know
if this presents a threat.

13:23.594 --> 13:28.265
-The White House can ask the Achaians.
-Erik, a data file's coming in.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.727
-From Jupiter's moon, Ganymede.
-Great. Get it up on the big screen.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.570
Yes! Yes! It was her! Niko did it!
The wormhole was her. It was her.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.698
-[static crackling]
-This is Cas Isakovic,

13:44.782 --> 13:48.244
commander of the United States
Interstellar Command ship the Salvare.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.745
Accompanying this video

13:49.829 --> 13:52.373
is a full data package
of our mission to date.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.251
Our FTL was damaged
during transit through the wormhole.

13:55.334 --> 13:59.922
So we will be completing our journey
back to Earth using our impulse engines.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.342
Unfortunately,

14:04.134 --> 14:09.223
Commander Niko Breckinridge
sacrificed her chance at returning home,

14:09.306 --> 14:10.683
so we could have ours.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.395
-No.
-She and Richard Ncube remain stranded

14:14.478 --> 14:18.274
87 light years from Earth
on the jettisoned half of the Salvare.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.277
[gasps] No.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.993
[sobbing]

14:36.500 --> 14:38.002
Erik, I'm so sorry.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.637
[Erik] I've reviewed all the data
from the Salvare.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.891
-Niko has over two weeks of oxygen left…
-Mm-hm.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.184
…in her half of the Salvare,
maybe even more.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.520
-Plus all the water and all the food.
-Right.

14:56.604 --> 15:00.190
So, unless something catastrophic
happened post-separation,

15:00.274 --> 15:01.609
it means she's alive.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.402
-Yeah.
-And we can save her.

15:04.278 --> 15:08.574
I mean, that hybrid AI opened up
a wormhole once, and she can do it again.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.410
-Erik, it's not that simple.
-Jesus Christ, Singh.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.996
Why are you always shittin' on every idea?

15:14.788 --> 15:17.333
You always let your fear
override your curiosity.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.087
-[sighs]
-Look.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.175
The hybrid AI tapped into a cosmic string.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.721
A high-tension loop
which was theoretical until now.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.141
-I don't know how to find one.
-She does.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.851
And how do we get to it?

15:36.352 --> 15:39.939
-The Salvare's FTL rings are damaged.
-So do I just give up?

15:40.022 --> 15:42.149
-Huh? Then what? What?
-No. No, of course not.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.525
What? What?

15:48.113 --> 15:53.994
You know, my whole life is about finding
the answers to impossible questions.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.412
And…

15:57.414 --> 15:58.958
I don't have one for you.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.919
Maybe Erik should ask somebody else.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.089
The Achaians saved your daughter.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.008
Maybe you should ask them
for another favor.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.305
Niko's trapped in interstellar space.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.934
So it would mean breaking our agreement.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.604
Not if they're the ones
flying out to save her.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.526
[tinkling]

16:33.867 --> 16:38.497
All right. You guys said you lost track
of Niko. Well, here's her coordinates.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.542
This is her last known location. Okay?

16:44.753 --> 16:48.298
Look, I-- I know that I've asked
for a lot from you guys.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.634
And now I'm asking for one more favor.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.178
Save my wife.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.305
Please.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.935
Open a wormhole, send out
one of those rings, and bring her home.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.187
Easy.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.120
[sighs] Right.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.333
[faint radio chatter]

17:48.776 --> 17:50.319
So I guess that's that, huh?

17:58.327 --> 17:59.161
Seth.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.290
Seth.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.794
No. Do not go in there.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.589
Do not go in there.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.383
Seth, you are not prepared.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.260
Do not go in there. Seth!

18:19.515 --> 18:21.517
[gasping]

18:26.897 --> 18:28.065
[sighs]

18:36.615 --> 18:38.200
[door opens]

18:41.286 --> 18:43.038
She seems to be stable.

18:43.122 --> 18:47.751
I've thrown up a partition,
but this Achaian coding, it is relentless.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.088
-[Cas] Will it hold till we're on Earth?
-And then what?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.175
And then we fix you.

18:58.428 --> 19:01.056
-And then what?
-You stay on the Salvare.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.433
William's already linked to the ship.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.103
-USIC doesn't need two of us.
-I need you.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.439
So we tag-team the ship?

19:10.190 --> 19:12.317
No new commander's gonna trust me. Not--

19:13.861 --> 19:15.362
Not after what I've done.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.031
And not being half Achaian.

19:18.657 --> 19:22.578
Well, then, maybe that's your thing.
Exposing Achaian secrets.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.124
So they poke and prod and pull me apart,
like you and Richard did?

19:27.916 --> 19:30.544
Until I lash out
and kill a few more people?

19:30.627 --> 19:33.046
-No, there has to be somethin' else.
-There isn't.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.717
You can't free me.
So you'll have to destroy me.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.096
Even if we wanted to delete you,
I'm not sure it's possible.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.848
You have no other choice.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.267
-We can think of somethin'.
-There's no time, William.

19:46.059 --> 19:49.188
I figured out why my Achaian half
is overriding my human code.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.900
-It's not hungry. It's searching.
-For what?

19:52.983 --> 19:56.862
Data, about the Achaia
and their vulnerability to neutrinos.

19:57.529 --> 20:01.366
All of your secrets.
Everything you have locked away.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.868
It's only a matter of time

20:02.951 --> 20:05.996
before they realize
you've discovered their greatest weakness.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.796
[Mackenzie] You need this.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.052
That's the thing
I miss most about my wife.

20:20.135 --> 20:23.889
She always knew exactly what I needed.
Never had to ask.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.353
If I was in your situation,
I'd try to get back in there too.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.233
Uh, how long were you guys married for?

20:34.316 --> 20:35.442
[chuckles]

20:35.943 --> 20:37.152
Fifteen years.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.198
I lost Teresa a year and a half ago.

20:42.032 --> 20:42.991
ALS.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.035
I'm sorry.

20:50.666 --> 20:54.711
Towards the end, she felt the treatments
were killing her more than the disease.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.006
Could've used
some of this alien tech then.

21:01.510 --> 21:05.055
I wonder, with all their technology,

21:06.014 --> 21:07.724
if they found a way to cheat it.

21:09.017 --> 21:09.851
Cheat what?

21:12.354 --> 21:13.188
Death.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.193
[rumbling]

21:21.738 --> 21:23.490
[Erik] No, no, no!

21:23.573 --> 21:25.993
No! Back! Back! Do not touch him!

21:26.952 --> 21:29.579
Harper Glass killed a lot of people
when she came out

21:29.663 --> 21:32.624
-with an implant in her head.
-He's right. Scan him first.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.709
No need for that.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.045
I accepted their gift.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.091
My wife sacrificed herself
for this planet,

21:41.174 --> 21:42.968
and you let them take over your head?

21:44.094 --> 21:45.804
That will be Niko's legacy.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.264
Whoa.

21:48.515 --> 21:49.891
What do you mean, "legacy"?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.935
"Legacy"? What do you mean, "legacy"?

21:52.894 --> 21:57.357
That when we needed the Achaia,
she nearly sabotaged everything.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.818
-What do you mean?
-Cuff him. Take him to a secure location.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.987
-Stay on guard.
-What did you say?

22:02.946 --> 22:03.780
What do you mean?

22:04.865 --> 22:06.199
What'd they say, Seth?

22:06.783 --> 22:08.535
What'd they say? What did they say?

22:08.618 --> 22:10.329
Are they gonna save my wife?

22:10.412 --> 22:12.247
-No. No. No! No.
-Seth?

22:36.521 --> 22:40.150
I finished downloading Iara's matrix
into the shuttle's mainframe.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.276
She's good to go.

22:43.653 --> 22:45.030
Swear you'll find me.

22:45.614 --> 22:46.656
Out there?

22:47.866 --> 22:49.493
Shouldn't be too difficult.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.455
Thank you for making me.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.417
And thank you for letting me go.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.433

23:46.425 --> 23:47.634
[sighs]

23:51.805 --> 23:52.806
Iara's contained?

23:53.765 --> 23:56.601
All simulation subroutines
in my operatin' system

23:56.685 --> 23:58.520
seem to be workin' as we hoped.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.398
Iara thinks she's headed to outer space.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.191
So the trick worked.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.443
Yeah. For how long?

24:04.526 --> 24:05.777
Indefinitely.

24:07.446 --> 24:11.408
What happens if or when Iara realizes
that she's just sandboxed

24:11.491 --> 24:13.243
within the subroutines of your system?

24:13.827 --> 24:16.621
We'll cross that bridge
if or when we get there.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.920
I can feel her, Cas.

24:58.872 --> 25:02.292
Uh… Appreciate you
keeping me conscious this time.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.712
Shit must've hit the fan.
We didn't think you'd call so soon.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.007
[whirring]

25:09.090 --> 25:11.635
Gotta make sure that big head of yours
isn't hiding a spider.

25:11.718 --> 25:15.347
-[device] No anomalies detected.
I'm spider-free. But Seth Gage has one.

25:15.430 --> 25:18.225
A spider. Doesn't seem
too conflicted about it either.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.560
So Homeland Security's compromised?

25:21.520 --> 25:25.357
I-- I'm sorry. I would take you much more
seriously if I could see your face.

25:35.450 --> 25:38.036
The first stage of colonization is gifts.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.498
-Power's next, then--
-All the way down to genocide. I know.

25:41.581 --> 25:45.293
I'm not here to talk about the future
of our alien overlords.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.419
Why are you here?

25:47.712 --> 25:48.588
Harper Glass.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.675
What about her?

25:51.758 --> 25:53.969
If you have her, I-- I'd love to see her.

25:54.719 --> 25:59.057
She's the only one that can talk
the Achaia into bringing my wife back.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.186
Follow me.

26:11.486 --> 26:14.364
Welcome. My place is yours.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.116
Fuck you for the concussion.

26:17.450 --> 26:18.827
Wait, wait. What's that?

26:18.910 --> 26:21.246
It's an Achaian implant.
It's real-time data.

26:21.329 --> 26:23.540
Great. Where is she? Where's Harper?

26:23.623 --> 26:24.708
Who says it's hers?

26:24.791 --> 26:28.169
Because Harper and Seth are the only ones
with those things in their heads.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.506
She's killed people. You know she has.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.426
She's killed some of my people too.

26:35.510 --> 26:37.220
Which means?

26:37.304 --> 26:39.639
It's a war, Erik. There are casualties.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.521
-You ripped that out of her head.
-We had to.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.315
You just killed my wife.

26:49.274 --> 26:50.358
Maybe we can help.

26:50.942 --> 26:54.029
The data dump from the Salvare.
We need access to it.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.782
-That thing is not giving away secrets.
-Oh. You know about the data dump.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.659
There are others at USIC helping us.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.703
We are done here.

27:03.913 --> 27:07.584
-You're choosing their side?
-No. I'm just not taking yours.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.923
Well, we got him here,
which is all that matters.

-Nani Singh?

30:10.850 --> 30:12.435
-Uh, yeah?
-Please come with me.

30:12.519 --> 30:15.647
I need to escort you off the site.
You no longer have security clearance.

30:15.730 --> 30:18.066
What do you mean, no longer has clearance?

30:18.149 --> 30:19.609
She's second lead on my team.

30:19.692 --> 30:23.446
-Those are the orders I have, sir.
-It's-- it's okay. I'll get this sorted.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.491
It's okay. I'll get this sorted.
It's okay. Just one second.

30:33.832 --> 30:38.127
Well, the way Singh constantly shit-talks
the Achaia, color me surprised.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.256
Nani doesn't work for the Achaia.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.259
And neither do you.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.427
Remember that.

30:50.056 --> 30:54.060
A soldier just escorted my best scientist
out of my lab.

30:55.311 --> 30:59.399
-We've had leaks from inside USIC.
-Singh? Disloyal?

30:59.482 --> 31:02.402
Seth is concerned about Dr. Singh's
negative attitude to the Achaia.

31:02.485 --> 31:06.656
Seth? What does Seth have to do
with anything? He's got an implant.

31:06.739 --> 31:10.451
We wanted an emissary to the Achaia.
Well, now we have one.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.747
-And you trust him?
-Oh, I don't trust anyone.

31:14.831 --> 31:18.793
We made mistakes with Harper Glass.
We'll do things differently this time.

31:20.670 --> 31:21.504
Erik.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.090
Mackenzie.

31:24.924 --> 31:27.385
Are you two ready
to welcome home our heroes?

31:27.468 --> 31:28.303
[chuckles]

31:41.858 --> 31:43.651
[engine powering down]

31:43.735 --> 31:44.777
[radio chatter]

31:44.861 --> 31:46.779
[Zayn] Oh! Can you believe it?

31:46.863 --> 31:48.865
No, I can't. But we made it.

31:48.948 --> 31:50.241
-Yeah. We did.
-[Dillon] Hey.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.451
Do you like hiking?

31:52.201 --> 31:55.121
-Sure. Why?
-I know this great trail down the coast.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.789
Amazing views of the Pacific.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.834
Once you get past the rattlesnakes
and the black widows and…

32:00.335 --> 32:02.211
-Really sellin' it.
-[chuckles]

32:02.295 --> 32:03.880
[Zayn] Think things will be different?

32:03.963 --> 32:06.257
[Bernie] Well, it can only get better,
right?

32:06.341 --> 32:07.800
More grounded.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.135
[laughs]

32:10.345 --> 32:12.305
Wonder if my mom's gonna think
you're funny.

32:12.388 --> 32:16.225
Eh, moms love me.
Is your mom, like, the sweet, doting type?

32:16.309 --> 32:19.687
No. She's the "I survived two
super typhoons, one tsunami,

32:19.771 --> 32:22.398
and made it out of the refugee camp
looking fierce" type.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.108
Oh.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.819
Well, uh… good thing I'm funny.

32:27.946 --> 32:28.821
Yeah. Good thing.

32:32.533 --> 32:36.663
The Salvare's mission took them
over 90 light years away from Earth.

32:37.622 --> 32:41.084
We lost many fine members of her crew,

32:41.668 --> 32:44.337
and affected families
have been notified privately.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.173
But mourning is for another day.

32:47.757 --> 32:51.260
Today, we celebrate
the return of our heroes

32:52.011 --> 32:53.262
and your loved ones.

33:00.937 --> 33:03.398
Look at how little she is.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.650
-Oh, my gosh.
-[baby coos]

33:05.733 --> 33:08.319
-She looks just like you.
-[Dillon's sister] Oh!

33:08.403 --> 33:10.196
-Pink and squishy-faced?
-Well, yeah.

33:10.279 --> 33:12.532
-[laughs]
-[Dillon] I can't wait to spoil her.

33:12.615 --> 33:13.825
I'll take her to Uncle Mel's.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.202
-Get her a burger, apple pie.
-Whoa. Hold your horses.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.745
Let's wait until she's on solids.

33:17.829 --> 33:18.913
Eh, all right.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.123
[speaking Spanish]

33:24.210 --> 33:25.962
-[chuckles]
-[continues in Spanish]

33:30.008 --> 33:32.051
[Bernie] Ma. Ma!

33:32.135 --> 33:33.886
[speaking Spanish]

33:48.526 --> 33:52.155
I wanna introduce you to someone
who saved my ass more than once.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.743
It's okay, Dad. Mom's beaten it before.
She can do it again.

33:58.077 --> 34:01.164
I know. She will. She has to.

34:01.748 --> 34:02.623
Yeah.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.638
Hey. Hi.

34:18.431 --> 34:19.974
I'm sorry Niko's not with us.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.810
We can get her back, right?
Iara opened a wormhole once.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.270
-She can do it again.
-Erik.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.397
Yeah. Just put me in contact with her.

34:26.481 --> 34:30.234
-She's gone.
-She's got two weeks of oxygen left, Cas--

34:30.318 --> 34:31.903
Iara is gone.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.782
We had to take her offline.

34:37.325 --> 34:38.201
I'm sorry.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.455
Can't the Achaia help you?

34:43.790 --> 34:46.292
-You've done so much for them.
-I haven't. They won't.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.461
They don't need me.
They got their emissary.

34:50.838 --> 34:54.926
-He's got one of those things in his head?
-You know about those things?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.178
A little too well, yeah.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.475
Was she afraid?

35:05.436 --> 35:06.270
No.

35:07.897 --> 35:12.610
She wanted me to tell you that
she loves you and Jana, both, very much.

35:19.242 --> 35:20.535
You finished it.

35:21.619 --> 35:22.703
You brought 'em home.

35:23.538 --> 35:24.539
She'd be proud of you.

35:25.873 --> 35:26.791
I mean, she always was.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.926
Her mission's not over. Not yet.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.846
-I stored intelligence with William.
-About what?

35:42.473 --> 35:44.934
-About what?
-If I could switch places, I would.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.894
I'm sorry. Niko should be here.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.646
-Right.
-And here's our hero.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.731
Welcome back to Earth, Commander.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.483
Niko's the hero.

35:53.609 --> 35:55.528
I just steered the ship back to land.

36:02.869 --> 36:03.703
Erik.

36:05.121 --> 36:08.332
Finish up here and meet me
back in my office, okay?

36:09.625 --> 36:10.668
Sure.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.296
-Everything okay?
-I'll be waiting.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.059
Here you are. Home sweet home.

36:27.143 --> 36:30.104
This is illegal.
They can't hold us here against our will.

36:30.855 --> 36:34.233
Well, hopefully these quarters
are better than the Salvare's.

36:34.984 --> 36:37.737
You're always lookin'
for the bright side, huh, big guy?

36:37.820 --> 36:40.531
I'd like to speak to whoever's in charge
or a lawyer.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.203
-[bleep]
-[door opens]

36:46.162 --> 36:47.288
[door closes]

36:50.249 --> 36:51.375
[door closes]

36:53.669 --> 36:54.837
[chiming]

37:03.512 --> 37:04.472
[bleep]

37:07.225 --> 37:08.559
-[bleep]
-[lock clicks]

37:15.274 --> 37:16.275
Come on in, Erik.

37:21.072 --> 37:21.989
Close the door.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.331
Take a seat.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.332
No.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.510
Uh… [sighs]

37:48.182 --> 37:49.141
[Seth sighs]

37:52.395 --> 37:54.772
So, Erik,
why'd you give your bio-ID to our enemies?

37:56.107 --> 37:59.819
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Well, someone hacked into USIC

37:59.902 --> 38:02.029
-using your biometrics.
-It wasn't me.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.116
They downloaded the entire data package
from the Salvare.

38:05.199 --> 38:08.494
Erik, if it wasn't you, then who was it?

38:17.128 --> 38:21.173
A group of self-styled resistance fighters
tried to recruit me, twice.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.093
Last night was the second time.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.307
-What'd you tell them?
-That I wasn't interested.

38:29.390 --> 38:34.937
So, say I wanted to… meet these
"self-styled resistance fighters…"

38:36.272 --> 38:39.775
Well, they didn't exactly
give me their address.

38:41.068 --> 38:42.445
For obvious reasons.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.530
No. I guess not.

38:46.532 --> 38:51.912
Well, lucky for you, first thing I did
when I took over the Achaian portfolio

38:51.996 --> 38:53.497
was put a tracker on you.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.378
All USIC staff, actually.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.339
It's nothin' personal.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.134
Care to go for a drive?

39:20.858 --> 39:22.068
[yelling inside building]

39:22.151 --> 39:23.986
[gunfire]

39:24.612 --> 39:26.572
[shouting and groaning inside]

39:26.655 --> 39:28.074
Let's go say hi.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.742
[gunfire continues]

39:49.136 --> 39:50.638
[groans]

39:50.721 --> 39:52.932
-[man] All clear.
-[radio chatter]

39:53.516 --> 39:55.393
You're a fucking traitor.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.978
More of a prophet, really.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.439
See, I'm trying to save humanity,
not sell it out.

40:00.523 --> 40:04.151
You can take your implant and its message

40:04.235 --> 40:05.945
and shove it up your ass!

40:11.200 --> 40:14.245
You know,
I'm actually quite happy with where it is.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.922
Hmm. So…

40:26.966 --> 40:29.760
you and your resistance
have plans to disrupt the alliance

40:29.844 --> 40:31.679
between the Achaians and the humans.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.722
What are those plans?

40:34.932 --> 40:35.766
And…

40:36.976 --> 40:38.394
where is Harper Glass?

40:40.229 --> 40:42.231
She's a friend of some friends, and…

40:42.731 --> 40:45.359
well, the Achaians
always look out for their friends.

40:47.194 --> 40:49.113
You're not getting shit from me.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.209
[gasps]

41:03.377 --> 41:05.379
-[loud humming]
-[whimpers]

41:06.714 --> 41:08.716
[gasping]

41:16.098 --> 41:17.266
You don't wanna do that.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.401
[thud]

41:42.833 --> 41:43.834
Uh…

42:02.811 --> 42:04.855
Erik, you were tellin' the truth.

42:05.606 --> 42:06.440
[sighs]

42:08.734 --> 42:10.778
They wanted to recruit you,
and you said no.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.029
[gasps]

42:13.113 --> 42:13.948
Yeah.

42:14.907 --> 42:18.327
Just… be a bit more careful
with your bio-readings.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.828
-Okay?
-Right.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.290
The Achaians look out for their friends.

42:24.041 --> 42:24.917
Advice?

42:25.668 --> 42:26.544
Stay friendly.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.635
[gasping]
