WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:05.483
Alright, this should be
more than enough kibble

00:05.570 --> 00:07.572
to last until
I get back from Branson.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.748
One bowl in the morning
and another one at night.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.534
That's easy to remember, my
sister's on the same schedule.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.190
It's that kind
of flippin' attitude

00:16.277 --> 00:18.148
that will put Jim
on a missing dog poster

00:18.235 --> 00:20.977
or spread eagle
in a car grill.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.588
She cannot be trusted
with your little brother.

00:23.675 --> 00:24.807
Don't worry about anything.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.722
Just relax
and enjoy your trip.

00:26.809 --> 00:29.377
Well, the Altar Rosary
Society has been planning

00:29.464 --> 00:31.466
this senior excursion
for ages.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.511
In fact, the lady
who spearheaded the whole thing

00:33.598 --> 00:35.078
went toes up last month.

00:35.165 --> 00:36.688
Oh, that's tragic.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.255
We're still takin'her with us.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.257
She wanted her ashes
scattered in the sawdust

00:40.344 --> 00:43.043
on the dance floor
at Gilley's.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.566
That's nice.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.916
Well, she loved to boot
scoot, and boogie.

00:47.003 --> 00:49.049
Plus, she was an alcoholic
who never met a cowboy

00:49.136 --> 00:50.659
she couldn't buck
before the bell.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.925
- Sounds like a sweetie.
- I didn't care for her.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.711
Anyway, make sure
Jim has got his chew toy.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.626
[toy squeaking]

01:01.713 --> 01:05.152
Otherwise, he'll be
whisker-deep in his poop-shoot.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.675
Mike's exactly the same way.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.720
I've got to put Tabasco
in his underpants.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.160
You know what, if yuck-a-puck
can't keep a cork in it

01:13.247 --> 01:14.813
I'm just gonna stay here.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.948
No, mom, it's good for you
to take these little trips.

01:19.035 --> 01:21.646
When you go on vacation,
it's kind of a vacation

01:21.733 --> 01:24.040
for all of us.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.173
Peggy, relax,
we're gonna take wonderful

01:26.260 --> 01:30.046
care of little,
Mr. Fuzzyface here.

01:30.133 --> 01:33.354
Don't call him silly dog names.
It just embarrasses him.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.617
Either call him by
his Christian name, Jim

01:35.704 --> 01:38.837
or his full name,
James Douglas MacArthur Biggs.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.841
Jim it is.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.975
Alright, we're out of here.

01:46.062 --> 01:48.151
You just have a good time and
we'll take great care of him.

01:48.238 --> 01:49.892
Hopefully, it'll
teach you silly hearts

01:49.979 --> 01:51.676
some responsibility
for when you decide

01:51.763 --> 01:53.678
to have your own little
14-pound miracle.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.639
Well, I'm sure
if we ever have kids

01:57.726 --> 01:59.293
we'll look back
on babysitting your dog

01:59.380 --> 02:00.555
as a valuable learning
experience.

02:00.642 --> 02:01.947
Hm.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.384
What do you mean,
"If we have kids"?

02:03.471 --> 02:05.299
- You mean, when, right?
- That's what I said.

02:05.386 --> 02:08.302
- No. You said, if.
- What's the difference?

02:08.389 --> 02:10.217
When means we have
to figure out the right time

02:10.304 --> 02:13.045
to have them, if means
you and I need to talk.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.222
Aw, I hate it when
we need to talk.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.574
When were you planning
on dropping this bombshell?

02:19.661 --> 02:22.620
On our honeymoon when you're
double-bagging your junk?

02:22.707 --> 02:24.753
Why are you harping on this?
You know how I am.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.363
Crap just falls out of my mouth.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.191
It's your fault for listenin'.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.889
- Forget something?
- Oh, I was just teasing him.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.369
You know how brothers are,
just giving you

02:32.456 --> 02:34.415
the business, James Douglas.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.073
You're lucky you're neutered.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.858
I'm just saying,
with the wedding and everything

02:42.945 --> 02:44.294
don't we have enough
crap to worry about

02:44.381 --> 02:45.861
without bringing
kids into the mix?

02:45.948 --> 02:48.298
I'm not asking you to plant
your seed on the ride home.

02:48.385 --> 02:49.821
But I, I'd like
to know that you're open

02:49.908 --> 02:51.127
to having a family.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.824
Yeah, I guess! I don't know.

02:52.911 --> 02:54.174
If it happens, it happens.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.437
Do you have any idea
how this works?

02:56.524 --> 02:59.483
Did you sleep
through health class?

02:59.570 --> 03:01.181
Look, we don't
even have our own place.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.834
You really wanna raise
a child in a house

03:02.921 --> 03:04.314
with your mom and sister?

03:04.401 --> 03:05.837
His first
birthday party will be

03:05.924 --> 03:08.188
at the Betty Ford Clinic.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.928
When I said
I wanted three kids

03:10.015 --> 03:11.539
and you said, "Sounds good"

03:11.626 --> 03:13.105
were you just
saying that to shut me up?

03:13.193 --> 03:15.325
If I was,
it clearly didn't work.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.634
We are getting married
in a few months

03:19.721 --> 03:21.288
and I'd like to know
that these breasts

03:21.375 --> 03:23.812
are gonna bring happiness
to someone besides you.

03:23.899 --> 03:26.293
When did you become
so baby crazy?

03:26.380 --> 03:27.816
Am I gonna have to sleep
with one eye open

03:27.903 --> 03:29.252
so you don't
steal my sperm?

03:29.339 --> 03:30.601
You're gonna have
to sleep with one eye open

03:30.688 --> 03:32.299
so I don't smother you
with a pillow!

03:32.386 --> 03:33.996
[Mike]
'Oh, ha, ha. Real mature.'

03:34.083 --> 03:36.259
[Molly]
"'Ha, ha. Real mature.'"

03:39.219 --> 03:41.699
- You forgot the dog again.
- 'No, you forgot the dog.'

03:41.786 --> 03:43.571
[Mike]
Great, mom you'd be.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.617
♪ For the first time ♪

03:46.704 --> 03:49.185
♪ In my life ♪

03:50.230 --> 03:52.710
♪ I see love ♪♪

04:05.288 --> 04:08.378
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.554
I heard screaming coming out
of your bedroom last night

04:10.641 --> 04:14.645
and it didn't sound
like the good kind.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.125
Do you wanna talk about
some of the disturbing things

04:16.212 --> 04:17.692
I've heard coming out
of your bedroom?

04:17.779 --> 04:20.260
Hot buns coming at ya.
Really, mom?

04:22.610 --> 04:24.568
You're the one who gave me
the chef's hat and apron.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.831
To be used in the kitchen.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.356
I would, but I don't want
you kids walking in on us.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.274
Morning, Mrs. Flynn.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.015
- Hello.
- Yeah. Whatever.

04:37.102 --> 04:40.802
- How'd you sleep, Mike?
- Back-to-back.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.370
Not gonna have
a baby that way.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.459
Unless he's some
kind of circus freak.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.942
- Have a pleasant morning.
- Good day to you.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.596
Yeah, whatever.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.296
- Okay, wanna talk about it?
- No.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.822
He's been leading me on
this whole time

05:00.909 --> 05:02.084
making me think
he wants a family

05:02.171 --> 05:04.260
and now he's backpedaling.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.699
Remember when I took
you kids to the circus

05:08.786 --> 05:11.311
and we saw that big bear
on a unicycle?

05:11.398 --> 05:12.834
Hm.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.498
W-what does that have to do
with anything?

05:24.585 --> 05:26.630
Beats me.
It just popped in my head.

05:31.853 --> 05:34.072
I'm not getting any younger,
and if we wanna have kids

05:34.159 --> 05:36.379
two girls and a boy,
Charlotte, Zelda, and Scott

05:36.466 --> 05:37.946
he's gonna have
to get on the stick.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.035
Technically, you're the one
who has to be on the stick.

05:42.385 --> 05:45.083
- I thought we had this talk.
- Yes, we did when I was 12.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.695
I just got over it
about a year ago.

05:49.174 --> 05:52.264
I'm just sayin',
you can't plan these things.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.658
I mean, take me for example.
I never wanted children.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.489
- What?
- Hell, no!

05:59.576 --> 06:00.751
Only reason
you're even here

06:00.838 --> 06:02.579
is because of
too many tequila shots

06:02.666 --> 06:04.059
and an expired
gas station condom.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.626
Oh, God.

06:05.713 --> 06:06.888
Don't wanna know,
don't need to know.

06:06.975 --> 06:09.325
Oh, geez, I was a wreck

06:09.412 --> 06:10.500
when I found out.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.372
I mean, you know,
I'm happy now

06:12.459 --> 06:14.330
you were a blessing,
blah, blah, blah.

06:14.417 --> 06:18.073
But, oh boy,
those were dark days.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.642
Mom, feel, feel free
to take some

06:21.729 --> 06:24.296
of this to your grave.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.473
The real fluke was your sister.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.345
Your daddy and I
were watching the Cubs on TV

06:29.432 --> 06:31.608
and there was a rain delay.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.610
The ground crew had time
to roll out their tarp

06:33.697 --> 06:35.612
but your daddy and I didn't.

06:37.658 --> 06:40.225
I walked this
ugly bastard nine blocks

06:40.312 --> 06:42.314
and he wouldn't
squeeze one out.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.014
Nary a turd.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.929
I, on the other hand,
had to duck-walk

06:48.016 --> 06:50.279
to the 7/11
and take a crap

06:50.366 --> 06:52.194
with a dog on my lap.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.244
I'm gonna just go to work.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.943
Oh, have a good day.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.553
You know, in the last
couple of years

07:03.640 --> 07:05.729
you girls have really started
to grow on me.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.388
I'd pet you,
but I'm actually

07:12.475 --> 07:13.781
more of a cat person.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.179
I'm not saying
I don't ever wanna be a dad.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.181
But I'm not just gonna
blindly jump into it.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.270
I'm the kinda guy that
likes to think things through.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.881
Since when,
I once saw you

07:26.968 --> 07:29.013
bite into a marshmallow
that was still on fire.

07:32.103 --> 07:36.368
It was falling off the stick.
I had to do something.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.675
The point is, I really
like what Molly and I have.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.938
And if we throw a kid into the
mix, it'll change everything.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.723
Well, that's true,
no more naked leap frog

07:42.810 --> 07:44.072
in the living room
when little Mikey's in there

07:44.159 --> 07:45.290
watching Road Runner,
and gnawing on

07:45.377 --> 07:47.771
a big wheel of cheese.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.643
Well, our foreplay
usually just involves

07:49.730 --> 07:51.558
me rubbing her feet
and turning off the TV

07:51.645 --> 07:53.864
but I know
what you're sayin'.

07:53.951 --> 07:56.563
On the other hand,
you and Molly are good people

07:56.650 --> 07:58.347
and would certainly
make fine parents.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.697
But that doesn't guarantee
what kinda kid you're gonna get.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.264
Take that idiot
we arrested this morning.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.440
I'm sure his parents
are lovely people

08:04.527 --> 08:06.660
who never imagined
that one day the little bundle

08:06.747 --> 08:08.270
of joy would try
to rob a liquor store

08:08.357 --> 08:10.141
using an ear of corn.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.231
His mistake was
takin' it out of his pocket

08:13.318 --> 08:16.104
and tryin' to fire
a warning shot.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.672
No, his mistake was
wakin' up this mornin' saying

08:18.759 --> 08:21.239
I'm gonna knock off a liquor
store with an ear of corn.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.504
A banana I could understand.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.462
That's got a natural
pistol grip, but corn?

08:27.942 --> 08:29.639
That's just lazy.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.948
Point being..

08:34.035 --> 08:35.863
...somewhere,
there are two nice people

08:35.950 --> 08:37.604
who had high hopes
for that moron.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.780
It's true, my parents
had 14 children

08:39.867 --> 08:41.912
and a couple have been
major disappointments.

08:41.999 --> 08:45.612
Ah, don't be so hard on
yourself, Samuel.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.309
I mean, being a waiter
may not be glamorous

08:47.396 --> 08:49.746
or even lucrative,
but it's a good, honest living.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.096
I was actually referring
to my brothers the pimp

08:52.183 --> 08:53.794
and the blood diamond smuggler.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.624
But thank you for the ego boost.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.193
- Absolutely.
- Oh!

09:02.280 --> 09:04.021
Hey, could I get
a glass of orange juice?

09:04.108 --> 09:06.589
Of course. I shall fetch
a special glass of OJ

09:06.676 --> 09:08.635
just for you.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.245
Fresh squeezed.

09:11.986 --> 09:14.728
I wouldn't drink that
if I were you.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.991
Why not?

09:17.078 --> 09:19.515
See? And your parents probably
had high hopes for you too.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.832
He's been doing it all day.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.877
First it was funny,
then it got sad

09:33.964 --> 09:36.097
now it's back
to being funny again.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.320
You never see a cat
carrying on like this.

09:42.407 --> 09:43.583
They're dignified animals.

09:43.670 --> 09:47.238
Clean their butts
with their tongues.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.197
He still grindin'
his balloon knot?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.766
Yeah, he's really
rubbing it raw.

09:52.853 --> 09:55.072
I'm little worried
he's gonna start a fire.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.422
Probably a roid.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.163
My Uncle Benny used
to get the same way

09:59.250 --> 10:01.601
but instead of a rug
he'd use a long shoe horn.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.866
I hope he's okay.

10:05.953 --> 10:09.304
He's fine,
he's in Miami Beach.

10:09.391 --> 10:12.089
Got a nurse that rubs
ointment on it.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.396
She meant the dog, Vince.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.138
Him? He's having
the time of his life.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.183
He's scratching
his ass on a nice rug

10:19.270 --> 10:21.751
with a couple of pretty
ladies watchin' him.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.624
Aw, "Pretty"? You're sweet.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.452
Hey, what's going on?

10:27.539 --> 10:30.107
Your house guest
is christening my new throw rug

10:30.194 --> 10:32.196
with his sphincter.

10:32.283 --> 10:35.112
Oh, God! Did he eat
something weird?

10:35.199 --> 10:38.202
He won't eat at all.
Plus, he hasn't pooped all day.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.683
That is miserable.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.772
When I was taking
pain pills for my back

10:42.859 --> 10:44.948
I couldn't buy
a good bowel movement.

10:45.035 --> 10:48.517
And believe me, after
nine days money is no object.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.043
Jim just threw up a little.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.524
Well, somebody was bound to.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.050
Jim just threw up a lot.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.486
- And he's not eating it.
- Um-mm.

11:01.573 --> 11:04.141
This is serious.
Okay, we gotta go to the vet.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.273
[honking]

11:05.360 --> 11:06.709
Come on. Come on!

11:06.796 --> 11:09.886
- Let's move it, people!
- Molly, calm down.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.496
I'm sure Jim will be fine.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.237
Hey, if anything happens
to that dog

11:13.324 --> 11:14.891
you tell that vet
to put me down.

11:14.978 --> 11:17.459
Otherwise, Peggy will
come after me and do it her way.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.853
And it will be slow,
and it will be painful.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.256
Got yourself a sick
lizard there, huh?

11:32.343 --> 11:34.041
He's an iguana, and yes

11:34.128 --> 11:36.304
he's not feeling
a 100 percent right now.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.522
Looks fine to me, I mean

11:37.609 --> 11:39.133
fine for a big, scary lizard.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.177
- Iguana.
- Iguana.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.400
Jacob's been very stressed out
since my husband and I split up.

11:45.487 --> 11:48.055
He's listless, lethargic.
He doesn't wanna do anything.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.318
Well, I can see
why you split up with him.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.755
- I'm talking about the iguana.
- I know, I know.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.105
I just...I joke
when I get upset.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.064
My future mother-in-law's
dog is sick

11:57.151 --> 11:58.587
and it happened on my watch.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.328
And she's not exactly
my biggest fan.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.330
Not that I'm hanging
her poster in my locker

12:02.417 --> 12:04.288
if you know what I mean but..

12:04.375 --> 12:06.464
So, what do you,
what do you feed this

12:06.551 --> 12:08.640
uh...thing here?

12:10.207 --> 12:12.644
Bugs or some kinda
lizard chow?

12:12.732 --> 12:13.776
Iguana.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.693
Boy, you don't open
the door a crack, do you?

12:20.087 --> 12:21.958
[cell phone ringing]

12:24.787 --> 12:27.181
[sighs]

12:27.268 --> 12:30.053
Peggy, hey!
How's Branson?

12:30.140 --> 12:32.795
Oh, everybody can't be stupid.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.453
Jim? Ji-Jim's fine.

12:38.540 --> 12:42.762
Uh, he can't talk right now.
He's, uh, doing his business.

12:45.242 --> 12:48.811
Uh, solid, I guess.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.987
Tapering nicely.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.991
Well, uh, neighbors
are watching out the window

12:55.078 --> 12:56.906
so I'd better pretend
to pick it up.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.865
Okay, bye.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.870
Sorry it took so long.

13:03.957 --> 13:07.351
I was burning a doob
back by the dumpst.

13:07.438 --> 13:10.180
Oh, my God!
That dog is really sick.

13:12.313 --> 13:15.664
Iguana. And head's up,
he's got the personality.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.104
So is Jim gonna
be okay, or do we need

13:21.191 --> 13:23.715
to find another dog
that looks just like him?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.935
They're still doing more tests.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.763
But keep an eye peeled.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.461
We may have to shave
and paint a cat.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.941
Been there, done that.

13:33.551 --> 13:37.033
- Who belongs to Jim?
- Oh, right here.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.339
Is he okay?

13:38.426 --> 13:39.819
Well, he's got some
sort of obstruction.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.429
Looks like he
swallowed something.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.561
Is there any idea of
how long it's been in there?

13:43.648 --> 13:46.347
Could this have happened
a couple of days ago?

13:46.434 --> 13:48.001
- Possibly.
- Yes.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.786
Could have happened on Peggy's
watch. What did he swallow?

13:50.873 --> 13:52.570
I've seen this kind
of blockage before

13:52.657 --> 13:53.745
and with a small dog
it's usually

13:53.833 --> 13:56.139
a sponge or more likely,
a tampon.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.187
Well, Peggy's
got an airtight alibi.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.581
One, two..

14:03.668 --> 14:04.844
[gasps]

14:04.931 --> 14:06.802
Damn it.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.939
How would you feel about
you and Molly adopting a baby?

14:13.026 --> 14:14.984
It doesn't matter
if it comes from her womb

14:15.071 --> 14:18.553
or some teen mom in Kentucky,
you still gotta raise it.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.077
Well, with adoption you get
the exact model you want.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.253
If it was me,
I'd get a little Japanese kid.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.864
They're smart,
loyal and they don't bring

14:24.951 --> 14:26.996
their shoes in the house.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.868
Sure, plus,
they'll do your taxes walk

14:28.955 --> 14:32.523
on your back and chauffeur
your Green Hornet car.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.308
Are you telling me you wouldn't
wanna have your own little Kato?

14:34.395 --> 14:36.919
Of course, who wouldn't?

14:37.006 --> 14:39.008
But you gotta be realistic,
one day, Kate's gonna need

14:39.095 --> 14:40.575
braces and wanna go
to college.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.011
No, Kato don't need
to go to college.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.665
He's gonna be street smart.

14:43.752 --> 14:44.971
Plus, if you're carrying
a set of nun chucks

14:45.058 --> 14:47.016
ain't nobody gonna make
fun of your teeth.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.366
[cell phone ringing]

14:49.453 --> 14:50.933
Aah!

14:51.020 --> 14:52.979
Hey, mom, how's Branson?

14:53.066 --> 14:55.633
Well,
everybody can't be stupid.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.855
Jim?
I don't know, I'm at work.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.858
No, I'm sure he's fine.
Don't come home.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.730
Look, I'll check on him
and I'll call you later.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.907
Boy, if she loved me half
as much as she loves that dog

15:07.994 --> 15:09.647
I'd weigh 130 pounds.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.781
You can certainly
understand her worry.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.130
That dog is like a son to her.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.524
Oh no, she treats him
way better than a son.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.613
She'd give one of her
kidneys to that ugly mutt

15:18.700 --> 15:20.354
but wouldn't drive
seven blocks to pick me up

15:20.441 --> 15:21.485
at school when I broke my arm.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.313
You're kidding.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.576
She said she was busy putting
air on her toe knuckles.

15:27.143 --> 15:28.666
So she told me
to hoof it, said

15:28.753 --> 15:30.277
"You don't walk
on your arm anyway."

15:30.364 --> 15:32.801
Which is ironically
how I broke it.

15:33.758 --> 15:36.457
[cell phone ringing]

15:36.544 --> 15:39.068
Hey Molly, what's up?

15:39.155 --> 15:41.201
Jim swallowed a what?

15:41.288 --> 15:43.333
Operate?

15:43.420 --> 15:45.118
Well, can't they
just pull the string?

15:50.645 --> 15:52.342
Tell that doctor,
whatever has to do

15:52.429 --> 15:55.432
no matter how much it costs,
j-just keep that dog alive.

15:55.519 --> 15:58.435
Seriously, if he needs a
new heart, come out, take mine.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.611
That dog must live!

16:02.135 --> 16:03.484
How's he doing?

16:03.571 --> 16:05.747
They're operating on him
to remove the blockage.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.618
Mike,
I'm so sorry about this.

16:07.705 --> 16:09.316
- It's not your fault.
- It is.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.361
I left my purse open
and laying around.

16:11.448 --> 16:12.841
I should be more responsible.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.799
Hey, some of this is on Jim.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.671
It's not like your tampons
are made out of rawhide

16:16.758 --> 16:19.543
and wrapped in bacon.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.590
Doesn't bode well for my,
let's have a baby campaign.

16:22.677 --> 16:24.505
Ah, don't be silly.

16:24.592 --> 16:25.897
That mutt's a garbage can.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.725
He once ate
a keychain flashlight.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.032
Pooped it halfway out
and took off runnin'.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.208
Looked like he was having
a movie premiere in his butt.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.780
I understand why you're
nervous about having kids.

16:38.867 --> 16:42.305
And you're right, it isn't
somethin' we should rush into.

16:45.308 --> 16:48.529
Molly, the truth is, I'm just
afraid I won't be a good dad.

16:49.704 --> 16:52.402
What are you talking about?

16:52.489 --> 16:56.276
My mom wasn't exactly
the most compassionate person.

16:56.363 --> 16:59.627
Or loving or tolerant

16:59.714 --> 17:02.543
or even nice to be around.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.762
I don't wanna pass that
on to the next generation.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.417
Are you kidding? You are
nothing like your mother.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.464
You are a joy to be around,
and your feet are smaller.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.991
You're just saying that
'cause you wanna have kids.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.560
I don't just want kids.
I wanna have your kids.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.388
You are the kindest..

17:21.475 --> 17:24.695
...sweetest man
that I have ever known.

17:24.782 --> 17:27.350
I don't even think I wanted
to have kids before I met you.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.702
- Really?
- Hey, I teach fourth grade.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.748
There's no better
birth control than that.

17:35.532 --> 17:36.925
Well, thanks to mom

17:37.012 --> 17:39.275
I certainly know
what not to do.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.798
Hm.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.279
I'm guessing
that's half the battle.

17:43.366 --> 17:46.065
And we can figure
the rest out together.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.371
When the time is right.

17:48.458 --> 17:52.201
Okay, when the time is right.

17:52.288 --> 17:53.898
You can feed 'em
and change 'em and I

17:53.985 --> 17:55.596
I'll keep 'em from swallowing
your lady things.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.251
[chuckles]
Deal.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.427
I'll just do what my mom
used to do.

18:00.514 --> 18:01.819
When we went
to the grocery store

18:01.906 --> 18:04.300
she'd pull a pair
of pantyhose over my head.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.520
I looked like a three year old
bank robber, but it kept me

18:06.607 --> 18:09.566
from shoving a stick
of deodorant in my mouth.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.656
I'm no fan of your mother's,
but that's actually brilliant.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.624
[grunts]
Look at my baby boy.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.105
He's gonna be scarred up
for the rest of his life.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.715
Yo-you don't think
it looks manly?

18:27.802 --> 18:29.195
Kinda..

18:29.282 --> 18:30.935
Kinda gives him
like a rugged

18:31.022 --> 18:33.024
you know
don't mess with me thing.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.506
If I wasn't afraid
of leaving Jim alone

18:36.593 --> 18:38.900
you and I would be
in the driveway right now

18:38.987 --> 18:42.556
settling this
bare-knuckle style.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.645
Come on, Ma,
your driveway-fighting days

18:44.732 --> 18:47.213
are behind you.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.040
Tell that to the bouncer
at Gilley's who tried

18:49.128 --> 18:52.783
to take away my coffee
can full of Dolores.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.263
He's gonna be fine.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.917
The stitches come out
in about ten days

18:56.004 --> 18:57.832
and the vet said
it won't leave much of a scar.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.617
Then I can thank her
for feeding my baby boy

19:00.704 --> 19:03.142
one of her cotton pontoons.

19:04.882 --> 19:08.364
Why can't you wear a pad
like a normal person?

19:08.451 --> 19:11.280
'Cause they're bulky
and uncomfortable

19:11.367 --> 19:14.457
and I feel like I'm sittin'
on a phone book, I..

19:14.544 --> 19:16.633
Plus, I, I lead
an active lifest..

19:16.720 --> 19:18.722
Fine, I'll wear one.
I'll just strap it on.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.031
It'll be a cold day in hell
before I forget this.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.512
I trusted you to take care
of the only thing

19:25.599 --> 19:27.340
in this world
I give a damn about.

19:27.427 --> 19:28.602
Yeah, I'll bet
you'd drive seven blocks

19:28.689 --> 19:29.994
if he broke his arm.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.648
He wouldn't break
his arm showing off

19:31.735 --> 19:33.868
for the girls' swim club.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.086
When you told me the story,
you didn't tell me

19:35.174 --> 19:36.436
there were girls involved.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.046
Of course,
there were girls involved.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.743
Why else would you try
to walk on your hands?

19:39.830 --> 19:42.746
Alright! Alright, alright.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.923
We should be thankful
that Jim is healthy, happy

19:46.010 --> 19:48.056
and...and loved.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.363
Like you, Peggy.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.498
Now why don't I go
make us a sandwich?

19:55.585 --> 19:59.285
What are you gonna put in it?
Rat poison?

19:59.372 --> 20:01.025
I was thinking about
tuna fish

20:01.112 --> 20:03.593
but whatever you want.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.466
Mike, why don't
you come help me?

20:06.553 --> 20:08.772
Miracle Whip, not mayo!

20:08.859 --> 20:12.689
[Molly]
'Whatever you want, Mama Biggs.'

20:12.776 --> 20:16.084
Hear that, Jim?
Whatever I want.

20:16.171 --> 20:20.219
This guilt trip might get me
a granddaughter named Peggy.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.960
Or a grandson named Jim.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.185
You know what? That does
make you look more rugged.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.803
[theme music]
