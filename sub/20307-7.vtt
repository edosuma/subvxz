WEBVTT

00:06.715 --> 00:08.008
Ah.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.681
-Hey, whatcha say, J.D.?
-Man, it's getting nippy outside.

00:14.764 --> 00:15.974
How you feeling?

00:16.057 --> 00:19.060
Yeah, Doc looked me over
last night after you left.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.395
He said the wound's healed in.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.231
He'll let me go this afternoon.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.607
You sound thrilled.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.359
Any chance you drive me home?

00:26.443 --> 00:28.445
Mm-mm. I'm backing Sarge in a pop.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.822
Maybe I can get away at lunch.
What about Lynnetta?

00:30.905 --> 00:32.157
What about Lynnetta?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.199
Hi.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.535
I'm sorry I'm late,
but my old car wouldn't start.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.662
You know, the doc says this bum
can go home today.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.080
Is it true?

00:39.998 --> 00:41.583
He said the infection's cleared up.

00:41.666 --> 00:45.128
Oh, Neal, that's great!
Well, what time do I pick you up?

00:45.211 --> 00:47.464
Hey, look, if it's gonna be trouble,
you don't have to.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.674
Will you tell me what time
you want me to pick you up?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.803
The doc said they'll sign
the release around 1:00.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.722
So you're all squared away, then, chap?

00:56.347 --> 00:58.308
Look, I'll stop by your crib tonight.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.976
I'll ride the elevator with you, J.D.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.312
If I hurry, I can shop for you
before I go to work.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.732
-Like I said, don't trouble yourself.
-Neal, why do you keep saying "trouble"?

01:05.815 --> 01:07.942
I have been waiting for this day.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.819
I'll see you at 1:00.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.905
See you.

01:17.577 --> 01:18.953
(indistinct chattering)

01:19.037 --> 01:21.748
Three: ongoings and undercovers.

01:21.831 --> 01:25.168
Phillips and Dunleavy are at
Ace Vacuum Cleaner Repair.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.087
A.M., Belker's a decoy courier

01:27.170 --> 01:29.839
for the 106th Street Diamond
Merchants Association.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.674
That banging is the plumber.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.803
He's asking everybody not to use
the men's room hot water

01:34.886 --> 01:37.639
-until he gives the all-clear.
-What's wrong with the plumbing?

01:37.722 --> 01:40.475
I don't know.
Four: memo from Juan at motorpool.

01:40.558 --> 01:44.479
"Even plates only, appointments available
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

01:44.562 --> 01:47.190
-of next week for N.D. sedan servicing."
-What about the odds?

01:47.273 --> 01:50.026
-I don't know that, either. Five...
-Roll-call olympics?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.778
We're still getting bum complaints

01:51.861 --> 01:54.239
from people along the Jefferson Corridor.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.158
Pass-by's do what you can
to keep those vagrants moving along.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.745
Finally, welcome to first tour,
Officer James Seabrook.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.623
Now, Officer Seabrook is gonna
be riding with Officer Coffey

02:03.706 --> 02:06.793
on account of Sergeant Bates
is gonna be taking over the squad room

02:06.876 --> 02:08.211
on account of yours truly

02:08.294 --> 02:10.547
is on an undercover operation
out on the streets.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.216
-Yeah!
-Okay, that's it! Let's roll.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.677
Let's do the job.
They're getting away out there.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.637
New world record.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.639
HILL: No kidding. Woo!

02:20.265 --> 02:23.059
Ashton-Wilkes method of canine discipline?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.894
Yes, this is Lieutenant Howard Hunter,

02:24.978 --> 02:28.148
and I am calling to confirm
my first obedience-class session

02:28.231 --> 02:29.607
at 8:00 this evening.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.988
I see. The advanced session?

02:35.655 --> 02:39.450
No, fine. I and my pup
will be there at 7:00.

02:39.534 --> 02:44.164
Miss Ashton-Wilkes must feel
that my Shar-Pei is precocious.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.582
(dial tone)

02:45.665 --> 02:48.084
-Captain Furillo.
-Mr. Heath.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.711
Again this morning, Captain.

02:49.794 --> 02:52.755
A pair of them sleeping in my doorway
when I show up to open.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.425
Look, we've increased
the pass-by's in the corridor.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.178
My men are under instructions
to discourage loitering.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.014
Unless the vagrants commit crimes,
there's little more we can do.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.099
I've never had this many bums!

03:03.183 --> 03:06.227
That neighborhood was going up.
That's what we all gambled on.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.729
Now this starts happening.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.815
I gotta tell ya, Captain,
there were three different fellas

03:10.899 --> 03:12.859
down at the Merchants' Association
last night

03:12.942 --> 03:15.153
talking about taking things
into their own hands.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.905
Tell those fellas that'd be a mistake.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.782
We're talking about people's
livelihoods here, Captain.

03:23.369 --> 03:29.542
(humming Battle Hymn of the Republic)

03:52.482 --> 03:54.150
Ha ha.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.443
-(turns on faucet)
-Oh!

03:55.526 --> 03:59.489
(rumbling)

04:01.866 --> 04:03.368
Aah!

04:03.451 --> 04:06.162
(screaming)

04:08.206 --> 04:10.583
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:10.667 --> 04:12.752
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:12.835 --> 04:16.798
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:23.846 --> 04:27.267
(theme music playing)

05:54.854 --> 05:58.149
You put yourself at risk,
you go out on the street every day,

05:58.232 --> 06:00.985
and you still ain't safe in
the privacy of your own toilet!

06:01.069 --> 06:03.071
Are you gonna stand here,
fat-mouthing, Renko,

06:03.154 --> 06:06.032
-or are you gonna finish up?
-You got a mean streak in you, Bobby Hill!

06:06.699 --> 06:07.950
You know what I heard, though?

06:08.034 --> 06:09.410
-What, Renko?
-In New York City,

06:09.494 --> 06:12.830
they got plumbers make upping
to $200,000 per annum.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.748
You made that up!

06:13.831 --> 06:15.958
I did not, and if you think
about how much they work,

06:16.042 --> 06:19.045
that's like $2,000 per hour.
Plumbers got it made.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.006
-Lieutenant.
-Lieutenant.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.091
Gentlemen.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.889
-Now what?
-I took a shower. I changed my uniform.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.350
(sniffs) I still got a stink about me.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.310
Renko, I don't smell anything.
I'm leaving.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.812
I got to sue somebody.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.563
It's not just like I'm wet with water.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.690
It's like I got raw sewage all over me.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.361
I got to put in for dry cleaning
or something.

06:46.114 --> 06:50.743
Mr. Rabinowitz, I understand
what I'm supposed to do.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.372
I pick up at the parcel office,

06:54.455 --> 06:57.208
I go to Golden's, I go to Cohen's,
then I go to you.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.545
I know that, sir. I have that.
Second floor, suite 211.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.297
Or if you're not there,
I use the phone from the downstairs lobby

07:03.381 --> 07:04.882
to call you at the other number.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.970
I just said that.
I will call you at the other number.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.054
Goodbye.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.141
GOLDBLUME: Come on!

07:13.224 --> 07:15.309
-What is it? What's he say?
-That's ridiculous!

07:17.437 --> 07:18.563
I don't want to hear this.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.440
Don't tell me that there's a snafu.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.901
They say... no buy money till tomorrow.

07:23.985 --> 07:27.780
-Is this on our bank examiner's scam?
-These bookkeepers know the situation.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.408
I mean, this is a total windfall collar.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.661
-You heard the conversation.
-But it doesn't make sense!

07:33.744 --> 07:36.122
It would take three weeks
to line up a pop like this.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.332
And here these guys
pick my name out of a phone list,

07:38.416 --> 07:40.293
-and we're gonna lose them?
-When tomorrow?

07:40.376 --> 07:41.752
They could issue it first thing.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.088
No, if there's any delay,
they're gonna smell a rat.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.007
We'll lose them
if we don't move right away.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.925
Stan, no money!

07:49.427 --> 07:51.262
Hey, we'll use my dough if we have to.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.514
-Easy, Sarge.
-No, I mean it.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.683
The buyout money
has been authorized, hasn't it?

07:55.766 --> 07:56.726
-Yeah.
-Well?

07:56.809 --> 07:59.812
Stan, all I'm gonna say,
it's out of policy,

07:59.896 --> 08:01.772
but if you want it, let's go for it.

08:01.856 --> 08:02.982
I want it.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.066
All set?

08:04.150 --> 08:06.736
Yeah, we're just ironing out
a few last-minute details.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.070
They picked the wrong pigeon.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.615
You're not kidding.
We're gonna bust these guys.

08:10.698 --> 08:14.619
Captain, I think maybe
I got this bum problem figured.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.205
(clears throat) See, it's a lazy cop.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.124
I hung out last night
where these bums have been showing up.

08:20.208 --> 08:24.086
I seen a Polk transport van
unloading them around 7:00.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.255
The uniform driving it is Earl Garrity.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.507
You saw his tag?

08:27.590 --> 08:29.258
I was N.D. across the street.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.427
I know the guy from when
I was up there before.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.512
He's lazy.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.014
He just didn't want to take them
all the way to the shelter.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.724
So he drops them in the corridor?

08:36.807 --> 08:38.935
Right across the border
from us and the Polk.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.812
I'll call Captain Calletano, let him know.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.314
Right.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.565
Good work, Norm.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.319
Celeste,

08:48.402 --> 08:50.863
Uh, get me Ray Calletano,
Polk Avenue, please.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.742
I just changed out of my soaking clothes.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.911
Can't you get Coffey and Seabrook?

08:56.994 --> 08:59.372
No, I cannot,
because Seabrook is a rookie,

08:59.455 --> 09:01.040
and it was an undescribed call.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.960
Well, thanks a lot!
Don't seniority count for nothing?

09:04.043 --> 09:05.920
Renko, all this time you were bellyaching,

09:06.003 --> 09:08.589
you could have been there
and back by now, and that's a fact!

09:08.673 --> 09:10.007
Okay.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.386
She's turning into a regular
sergeant, ain't she?

09:14.637 --> 09:17.848
Yes, I'm aware it's a serious accusation.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.059
Norm Buntz
is quite clear about what he saw.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.687
Ray. Ray!

09:23.980 --> 09:27.275
Well, yeah, if you want to come in, fine,
but I don't think it's necessary.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.485
Yeah.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.237
Bye.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.991
(whirring)

09:35.074 --> 09:36.576
MAN: All right, hold your end off.

09:36.659 --> 09:40.246
(scraping)

09:41.247 --> 09:42.832
Who's in charge here?

09:42.915 --> 09:45.418
I'm in charge here. Hey!

09:46.168 --> 09:47.378
Tall drink of water!

09:47.461 --> 09:50.339
We got guys using the men's toilets,
and the room is still flooding.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.050
-How long are you gonna be?
-We're dealing with pressure here.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.012
I mean, you got a little inch
and a half pipe squeezing things down.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.222
I gotta get my big 2-inch
in there to replace it.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.515
How long?

10:00.891 --> 10:03.519
You hired the best.
Relax, you're in good hands.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.854
Give me a time.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.649
How about 8:00, you and me?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.860
I get cleaned up,
I'm not such a bad-looking guy.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.820
Tell me when you're gonna be out of here.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.031
By 2:00 you'll have perfection.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.073
Thank you.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.826
Whew.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.968
Delivery for Meyer Rabinowitz?

10:36.052 --> 10:38.012
Oh, Mr. Rabinowitz.

10:38.095 --> 10:41.766
-Yes.
-It's me, Detective Belker.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.810
Oh, I should have warned you
about the disguise.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.730
It's very good.
I would never recognize you.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.399
Ah. We have to try again on Friday.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.943
On Friday.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.904
Well, I have to get back.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.739
Good idea.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.032
Get back.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.700
I'll see you on Friday?

10:59.784 --> 11:01.077
On Friday.

11:06.165 --> 11:09.377
(siren wailing)

11:11.962 --> 11:13.673
(tires squealing)

11:14.507 --> 11:16.342
You bum! (murmurs)

11:16.425 --> 11:17.385
Cut it out!

11:17.468 --> 11:21.263
-Cut it out, man!
-You bum, you stink! You stink!

11:21.347 --> 11:22.598
Why did you hit me?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.810
-RENKO: What is wrong with you, Mister?
-MAN: You stay away from my place!

11:25.893 --> 11:27.645
-You okay?
-I'm scared.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.356
-What did this man do?
-Urinate in the back when I come to work!

11:30.439 --> 11:32.733
It was John! It wasn't me.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.110
Yeah, cadging rolls from me!

11:34.193 --> 11:36.404
He's got the nerve to come
inside when I open up!

11:36.487 --> 11:37.571
I get rolls here.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.573
You never got rolls from me!

11:40.866 --> 11:42.493
(crying) I'm lost.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.828
It's okay, sir.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.788
My name is Toby.

11:45.871 --> 11:46.997
Okay, Toby.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.541
I'm lost!

11:48.624 --> 11:50.710
Okay, Toby, let's go get this hurt fixed.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.753
-(cries)
-See if we can work this problem out.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.423
You almost bought yourself
an assault charge there, pal.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.258
I'm in the wrong place.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.301
In the morning, I get my trade.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.762
Last month, people didn't come by
on account of the bums.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.180
I can't make a living!

12:03.973 --> 12:05.766
Look, I'm sorry I lost my temper,

12:05.850 --> 12:07.977
but, I mean,
he just got a little confused.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.645
Everyone's got their problems, huh?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.690
You sling somebody into a wall
like that again, mister,

12:12.773 --> 12:14.525
you're gonna have more than your portion.

12:20.322 --> 12:23.492
So, what are you saying here, Captain,
I ought to have my eyes examined?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.619
All I am saying is I am here

12:25.703 --> 12:28.581
because I find these
accusations hard to accept.

12:28.664 --> 12:31.834
Are you aware that I instituted
a second delivery of vagrants

12:31.917 --> 12:34.587
-each day to the shelter?
-Hey, maybe that's your problem, huh?

12:34.670 --> 12:37.214
Look, as long as I've known Garrity,
he's been a lazy hump.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.967
Is there some kind of a personal vendetta
between the two of you?

12:40.050 --> 12:42.845
No, no, there isn't.
Captain, am I done here?

12:42.928 --> 12:45.222
Uh, you have any more questions
for Lieutenant Buntz?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.266
I think I have all I need.

12:51.812 --> 12:55.274
Accepting for the moment
the lieutenant's version of events,

12:55.357 --> 12:58.819
I don't believe one isolated incident
warrants this attention.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.489
It's a deteriorating situation, Ray.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.283
We've had continual complaints
from merchants in the corridor.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.035
Take a ride up Jefferson.
See for yourself.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.828
The hill has always had vagrants.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.705
You can't hold me accountable

13:09.789 --> 13:11.749
for a problem that's endemic
to your precinct!

13:11.832 --> 13:14.502
Nobody's holding you
accountable for problems in my precinct.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.087
All I'm asking you
is to handle a problem in yours.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.881
-Do you think I can't?
-Of course I don't.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.509
-But you insinuated it!
-I'm sorry you took it that way.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.595
All I meant to suggest
was that something's misfiring

13:24.678 --> 13:26.847
in your deliveries to the shelter.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.974
I will look into the situation,

13:29.058 --> 13:30.392
I assure you.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.023
I will keep you apprised.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.908
-Sandwiches.
-Thanks.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.910
So, Henry, any luck with the I.R.S.?

13:47.993 --> 13:50.204
-Luck? Yeah, I'm not in jail.
-(chuckles)

13:50.287 --> 13:51.997
-(knock on door)
-Relax.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.545
-Sandwiches.
-(knock on door)

14:05.886 --> 14:07.429
-Mr. Jablonski?
-Yeah.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.432
Special Agent Dupre,
Federal Depository Investigation.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.976
Oh, glad to meet you.

14:12.059 --> 14:15.062
This is my partner, Special Agent Whitsun.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.606
-Yeah, come on in.
-Thank you.

14:17.690 --> 14:21.277
So, tell me, how did you
fellas get my name?

14:21.360 --> 14:24.405
Federal deposit records matched
against social security.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.115
See, we get a lot of stuff like that.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.117
In a situation like this, it really helps.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.287
Yeah, I read in the papers
about all this "tele-malarkey."

14:31.370 --> 14:33.122
It really ticks me off.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.249
So you'll know, your savings and loan

14:35.332 --> 14:37.668
is the biggest problem
in our jurisdiction,

14:37.751 --> 14:41.130
especially in regards to miscounts
on you elderly people.

14:41.213 --> 14:45.217
Yeah, yeah, always take
advantage of the seniors.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.553
That's the name of the game these days.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.848
Well, if I can be of service,
I'd be glad to help.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.141
My advice--

14:52.224 --> 14:55.311
-The Sarge ain't too shabby at this.
-WHITSUN: When you're in the back,

14:55.394 --> 14:58.063
keep your eye open for
any suspicious behavior.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.358
We don't know
if it's the teller or bank officer.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.819
(scoffs) Could be the president
down there.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.070
That's what we don't know.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.698
So, I, uh, I gotta keep my eagle eye open.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.243
Mr. Jablonski,
your thinking on this is 100%.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.121
We certainly appreciate your help.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.331
Thank you.

15:19.501 --> 15:23.255
-HILL: This way, Toby.
-We were at County Hospital.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.590
That's right.

15:24.673 --> 15:28.636
-1400 Sycamore Street.
-Let's go get that hot chocolate, pal.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.055
Uh, excuse me, Captain,
can I talk to you for a minute?

15:31.639 --> 15:33.974
Sir, we got a wrong cop
down on Polk Avenue,

15:34.058 --> 15:38.479
and if we can get this poor individual
to identify him in the P.B.A. book,

15:38.562 --> 15:40.522
-we'll try and get his name.
-Earl Garrity.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.150
-How'd you know?
-Lieutenant Buntz spotted him last night.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.153
-Does Captain Calletano know?
-He's taking care of it. Thanks, Andy.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.656
Hey, Sergeant Bates.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.659
Thank you very much for
the wonderful assignment.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.785
You're very welcome.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.870
-Where's Seabrook?
-With the deceased.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.830
-You call that coroner?
-Immediately.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.922
Detective Belker, this is Mr. Rabinowitz.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.924
So, Detective Belker,
where are my diamonds?

16:07.007 --> 16:08.592
I've been waiting two hours already.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.469
What are you talking about?

16:11.887 --> 16:13.305
I gave you your diamonds.

16:13.389 --> 16:16.016
Of course you didn't give me.
Why would I be here if you gave me?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.142
We had a conversation.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.353
I handed them to you right in
front of your office.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.855
Brilliant, Detective.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.857
In front of my office?

16:24.733 --> 16:25.567
Yeah.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.361
What did we agree if I wasn't there?

16:27.444 --> 16:28.904
-You were there.
-I was there?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.489
Yeah.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.117
Oy! Oy.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.577
Maybe...

16:37.454 --> 16:39.832
It was my thieving,
lying brother who was there!

16:46.714 --> 16:48.757
Mr. Rabinowitz, I could be wrong,

16:48.841 --> 16:51.301
but this sounds like
a family problem to me.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.429
The man steals the bread
from my children's mouths,

16:53.512 --> 16:54.930
and to you it sounds
like a family problem?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.765
-Your brother's in the diamond business?
-Sure!

16:56.849 --> 16:58.976
You call the schlock
Rabinowitz sells diamonds?

16:59.059 --> 17:00.269
I don't know, but maybe

17:00.352 --> 17:04.398
you two could settle this
between you on business terms.

17:04.481 --> 17:07.109
What do you say, Mr. Rabinowitz?
Wanna give it a try at least?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.361
-When he laughs in my face?
-Then I'll get involved.

17:09.445 --> 17:12.197
Please don't move. You stay here.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.367
I'll go. I'll get laughed at.
Then I'll be back.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.291
Ow!

17:22.374 --> 17:25.044
It's hot, Toby.
You got to blow on it a little.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.922
Okay, let's see if we can find
that police officer

17:29.006 --> 17:31.967
-who dropped you off this morning.
-Don't tax your patient, Robert.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.762
-Mystery is solved.
-You know the cop's name?

17:34.845 --> 17:35.846
Earl Garrity.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.766
Uh, how's your skull there, partner?

17:38.849 --> 17:39.808
Okay.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.603
Will you take me home?

17:44.229 --> 17:47.232
Now, Toby, you sure
you live at that address?

17:47.316 --> 17:50.110
7312 Polk Avenue.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.488
In it or behind it?

17:53.405 --> 17:54.573
Behind it.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.494
Well, partner, how about a hot meal first?

17:58.577 --> 17:59.620
Fine.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.664
-Let's go! Hot meal right here!
-Where? Yeah, it's hot.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.999
Take this for me, please.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.505
DUPRE (on radio): <i>Anyone seem suspicious?</i>

18:10.130 --> 18:13.217
JABLONSKI (on radio): <i>Maybe</i>
<i>this one teller, a little Oriental girl.</i>

18:13.300 --> 18:16.512
DUPRE: <i>Orientals... who knows</i>
<i>what they're thinking, right?</i>

18:19.890 --> 18:22.434
Well, maybe it was because
I was withdrawing $1,800.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.145
I don't do that every day of the week.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.856
You gonna mark it here?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.942
DUPRE:<i> Yeah, we got everything right here.</i>
<i>Go ahead. Get in.</i>

18:30.025 --> 18:33.403
-Watch your head. You all right?
-Yeah, woo!

18:35.572 --> 18:38.992
-Good to get in out of the cold.
-Now, you gotta give me that.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.829
Okay.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.754
You see, by marking it,
if they try a miscount,

18:50.838 --> 18:52.339
we can read it with the infrared.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.175
-No kidding?
-Yeah, we got the highest technology.

18:55.259 --> 18:58.178
-Because, you know, we gotta stay current.
-Right.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.266
I'm out.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.478
Mr. Jablonski, could you hand me
another one of these back there?

19:06.562 --> 19:08.397
By the antifreeze.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.816
-(metal objects falling)
-Is this it?

19:10.899 --> 19:13.569
-No, it's further back.
-Oh.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.070
Can you reach it?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.572
Yeah, I think so.

19:16.655 --> 19:17.906
That's the switch.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.035
-(mumbles)
-That's the stuff.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.039
There we go.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.959
It's the starter motor.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.671
Now, when you redeposit this,
tell them you planned

19:32.754 --> 19:34.840
-on buying a vehicle or something.
-All right.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.217
-Maintenance strikes again.
-(sighs)

19:38.969 --> 19:41.471
Okay, here we are.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.473
Kenny, we got a problem.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.310
Mr. Jablonski,
could you excuse me, please?

19:46.393 --> 19:48.604
(horn honks, tires screech)

19:48.687 --> 19:50.731
-What's going on?
-Get him out!

19:52.274 --> 19:54.568
-Get him out!
-Don't make me hurt you, pop!

19:54.651 --> 19:56.028
(engine turns over)

19:59.656 --> 20:01.116
(tires squeal)

20:01.200 --> 20:03.327
(tires screech, horn honks)

20:03.410 --> 20:06.413
-You all right?
-For God's sake, they got my dough!

20:10.500 --> 20:13.086
Whoever administrates
this sort of thing, that's all.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.546
I just want to talk to him.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.090
I said to the room clerk,

20:17.174 --> 20:19.176
"How could you live with that smell?

20:19.259 --> 20:20.928
Why didn't you just go in the room?"

20:21.011 --> 20:23.972
He said the guy's rent
is paid up till the end of the month.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.390
How's your partner doing?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.727
Seabrook? He's okay. I just talked to him.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.896
No coroner yet?

20:31.813 --> 20:35.234
No. He'll be all right.
He's getting his second wind.

20:38.820 --> 20:39.988
Thanks.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.908
The doctor said that's okay?

20:42.991 --> 20:45.035
A little coffee and lots of cream.

20:47.579 --> 20:49.998
-You're gonna be around today, right?
-What do you mean?

20:50.082 --> 20:53.085
-I mean, you're gonna be at home?
-Right.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.046
Where else would I be?

20:56.129 --> 20:59.299
I just wanted to make sure you're not
pulling double shift or something.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.343
Are you okay?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.303
I'm perfectly all right.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.308
(indistinct conversations)

21:11.770 --> 21:15.148
Well, this Greenvale place
says that they'll consider him

21:15.232 --> 21:16.692
if we fill out the paperwork.

21:16.775 --> 21:21.655
Greenvale Hospital, 2319 Anderson Street.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.156
GARRITY: Aw, isn't this sweet?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.325
See, now it all makes sense.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.745
Check out the nametag, Renko.

21:28.829 --> 21:32.249
Hey, kid, you rode up with me
from Polk last night, didn't you?

21:32.332 --> 21:35.085
-I'm afraid.
-You got a problem there, Officer Garrity?

21:35.168 --> 21:36.003
No problem.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.422
I just figured out
how I got put on report.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.841
Einstein here goes crying to you,

21:40.924 --> 21:44.845
you rat to Furillo,
Furillo rats to captain taco.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.889
Now, you listen to me, mushbrain.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.393
You better find an alley to live in here
because you got zero future at the Polk!

21:51.476 --> 21:53.270
Why does everybody yell at me?

21:53.353 --> 21:55.355
Alright, now you listen to me,
Officer Garrity.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.442
A: I did not turn you in
because I didn't have the chance to do it.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.945
And B: you threaten this man again
and I will make your dentist real happy.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.238
You got that?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.531
Hey, Garrity.

22:05.615 --> 22:06.992
Lieutenant Buntz.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.786
Nothing's changed, huh?
You still cutting corners.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.330
What's that supposed to mean?

22:11.413 --> 22:13.623
Figure you'll save
20 minutes, right, Garrity?

22:13.707 --> 22:16.460
Why drive them all the way to Van Buren?
Why not drop him on the hill?

22:16.543 --> 22:19.296
-Maybe they'll stay up there, right?
-It was you that turned me in.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.048
Ha ha ha. And people say you're stupid.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.260
It was you. I guess that puts
an end to it, huh, <i>Lieutenant?</i>

22:25.344 --> 22:27.220
Oh, you mean because of rank?

22:27.304 --> 22:29.890
No, that doesn't have to be the end of it.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.977
Well, you transferred
to the right precinct, Lieutenant.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.729
up with the other stand-up guys.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.522
As long as you say it walking.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.612
And remember what I told you.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.409
That was pretty sharp there, Lieutenant.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.830
I'm afraid to go home now.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.959
No way he gets into Greenvale tonight.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.961
Main shelter don't open till 5:00.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.922
I get beat up in the shelter.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.758
-Andy, your friend need a room?
-I don't know. You got something?

23:04.841 --> 23:08.053
Well, the aroma's not great,
but the rent's paid.

23:08.136 --> 23:10.680
Toby, how would you like
a place to stay for a while?

23:10.764 --> 23:13.600
COFFEY: Hey, look, this isn't the Ritz.
There's a downside to this.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.478
-What kind of downside, Coffey?
-Wait. This guy ain't exactly got

23:16.561 --> 23:19.481
a whole world of options open to him.
Want to take a look at it, Toby?

23:19.564 --> 23:20.649
Okay.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.234
How bad could it be?

23:46.007 --> 23:48.343
This is a nice place.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.221
Sir, we know welfare's paid
for the room through the 30th.

23:51.304 --> 23:54.808
Now, we want to have that room
for our friend only for a night.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.727
We'll get him into Greenvale
in the morning.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.188
I thought they had shelters
for these guys.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.274
Well, they do,
but this particular individual

24:02.357 --> 24:03.859
has a problem in a place like that.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.695
And even if we could get him
in there, sir,

24:06.778 --> 24:09.865
the other guys would just
kick him out of the lines.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.492
-Get the door open, please.
-(hinges squeaking)

24:19.708 --> 24:22.210
Did somebody make uh-oh?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.753
I'd really like to help you fellas,

24:23.837 --> 24:26.047
but I just can't let
an unregistered guest stay here.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.090
We got our standards.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.259
Oh, I can see that by looking around here!
You see,

24:29.342 --> 24:32.012
but we have our standards, too,
like that red zone,

24:32.095 --> 24:34.514
that no-parking zone out there.
We've been real lax on that one.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.600
I always try to cooperate
with law enforcement.

24:36.683 --> 24:37.893
Give him the key.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.102
Come on, Toby.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.854
$10 charge if you lose it.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.564
Let's go, buddy.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.441
I signed as the witnessing officer.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.651
Good work, Seabrook.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.737
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't get back sooner, but...

24:48.820 --> 24:50.071
No problem.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.698
It's really kind of amazing.

24:51.781 --> 24:54.659
After the first hour,
you hardly notice the smell.

24:56.870 --> 24:57.954
(sighs)

25:01.458 --> 25:04.044
I'll shut that if it gets too cold.

25:04.127 --> 25:05.962
Only if it gets really cold, Toby.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.548
Look, here, Toby.
Officer Hill and I are gonna see

25:08.632 --> 25:11.092
if we can check you into
Greenvale Hospital tomorrow.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.386
2319 Anderson Street.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.847
That's right. 2319 Anderson Street.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.307
I'm hungry.

25:17.390 --> 25:18.391
Toby, you just ate.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.686
But I'm real hungry because my head hurts.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.855
Toby, put your hand up here.
Put your hand up here.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.774
Now, here's $2. One, two. Okay?

25:25.857 --> 25:27.776
Now, you go down the stairs
down to the corner.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.903
There'll be a store there, okay?
Now, tomorrow…

25:29.986 --> 25:33.198
tomorrow, if everything works out okay,

25:33.281 --> 25:36.201
we'll have a social worker
come by to check up on you.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.036
Won't you check on me?

25:38.954 --> 25:40.997
-Uh, yeah, if I can.
-When?

25:41.081 --> 25:43.542
I don't know. Whenever it is--

25:43.625 --> 25:46.461
Look, Toby,
we got other things to do for our job.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.797
Because you're policemen.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.881
That's right.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.134
Okay, then.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.514
-Okay, then.
-I will wait for the social worker, then.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.557
Okay.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.102
When is she coming?

26:04.312 --> 26:05.564
I don't know, Toby.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.816
We'll see you, partner.

26:10.026 --> 26:10.986
See ya.

26:13.613 --> 26:14.698
Bye!

26:23.498 --> 26:25.750
What do you mean, I can't have the money?

26:25.834 --> 26:28.461
That's $1,800 I lost.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.423
That money was authorized.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.426
Three weeks?

26:34.509 --> 26:37.637
Mr. Stankovich,
I can't believe what you're telling me.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.265
You're telling me
that the money was authorized,

26:40.348 --> 26:43.268
but now that it's lost,
I got to wait three weeks.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.896
But, you can't do that.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.357
That's my own personal money here.
I'm telling you--

26:50.942 --> 26:53.028
You're sorry? (chuckles)

26:53.111 --> 26:55.488
-What the hell? You're sorry? Hey!
-Excuse me, please.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.573
I can't believe this.

26:56.656 --> 26:57.741
Please.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.409
I can't believe this day.

27:01.328 --> 27:04.998
(clears throat) Excuse me, please.
My name is Israel Rabinowitz.

27:05.081 --> 27:08.460
I'm the brother of Meyer Rabinowitz.
I must see Detective Belker.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.214
Israel Rabinowitz? You got my message?

27:13.298 --> 27:15.133
I just spoke with my brother Meyer.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.927
We'll be in interrogation A. This way.

27:18.011 --> 27:21.473
It's all true. I took Meyer's diamonds
from you this morning,

27:21.556 --> 27:24.059
but I already sold them
and spent the money.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.477
How could you do that?

27:25.560 --> 27:27.979
Oh, I'm a terrible businessman.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.397
I needed the cash.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.399
Tell me,

27:31.483 --> 27:33.735
how long a sentence would I get
for pleading guilty?

27:33.818 --> 27:35.737
-(grunts)
-Hey!

27:35.820 --> 27:37.405
Maybe you could help me a minute here.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.449
I mean, somebody must've made a mistake.

27:39.532 --> 27:42.410
I got this mother of pear Caddie,
spinach-green top.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.580
Guess what somebody by the name
of B-A-T-E-S did.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.207
You were parked by the pump.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.542
And? I mean,
am I on emergency call or what?

27:49.626 --> 27:51.127
-What are you, Dr. Plumber?

27:51.211 --> 27:52.337
What do you got against me?

27:52.420 --> 27:54.130
What's with this hard-guy routine?

27:54.214 --> 27:56.549
You said 2:00.
It is now quarter after 3:00.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.426
I got men in there using the ladies' room,

27:58.510 --> 28:01.388
and I got plumbing junk
on every single floor of this building.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.972
This is an antiquated plant.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.642
I mean, some of these pipes
ain't been looked at in 60 years.

28:05.725 --> 28:08.395
Everybody's an expert.
Everybody's the plumber.

28:08.478 --> 28:11.147
I cannot function
in a climate of negativity.

28:11.231 --> 28:13.108
If I rip this up, what time are you done?

28:13.191 --> 28:14.526
4:00.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.112
Maybe 4:30.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.491
Is, uh, Detective Belker in?

28:21.574 --> 28:23.410
Wait a minute. You were just with him.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.577
Where'd he go?

28:24.661 --> 28:27.288
Uh, he must be with my brother Meyer.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.417
I knew it! I know this--

28:30.500 --> 28:32.377
-Maybe you should come with me.
-Please.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.712
What can I tell you?

28:33.795 --> 28:35.797
I feel like a world-class rat.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.800
Just give me ten days,

28:38.883 --> 28:41.052
get my affairs in order, lock me up.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.471
-Whatever I deserve.
-(knock on door)

28:44.848 --> 28:46.558
There's another Rabinowitz here.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.268
Meyer! Oh, I knew it.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.062
You're not Israel?

28:51.146 --> 28:53.273
I'm Israel.

28:53.356 --> 28:55.692
And that lying scum
since the day he was born

28:55.775 --> 28:57.068
is my fine brother Meyer!

28:57.152 --> 29:00.113
All right. He says you stole his diamonds.

29:00.864 --> 29:04.701
He came here, says he's me,
and says I stole?

29:04.784 --> 29:06.494
This morning I said you stole...

29:07.454 --> 29:08.997
-Which you did!
-Here!

29:09.080 --> 29:12.292
Here are your garbage-class diamonds,

29:12.375 --> 29:16.212
which I was going over to give you
to tell you the favor I did you.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.257
And this! This moronic trick
is all the gratitude I get!

29:19.340 --> 29:20.425
Let me see them.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.469
-Let me see.
-Oy.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.305
-Oy, Israel.
-What? What?

29:25.388 --> 29:27.974
Pathetic! Pathetic and predictable!

29:28.057 --> 29:30.059
He switched the stones on me!

29:30.143 --> 29:31.311
I guarantee!

29:31.394 --> 29:33.813
Ha! The guarantee of Meyer Rabinowitz?

29:33.897 --> 29:37.317
-A contradiction in terms!
-Our mother should turn over in her grave!

29:37.400 --> 29:39.986
Our mother, who always wanted
somebody to adopt him!

29:40.069 --> 29:44.157
(all shouting)

29:47.494 --> 29:48.745
Okay!

29:48.828 --> 29:50.330
Okay!

29:50.413 --> 29:52.290
That's it!

29:52.373 --> 29:54.334
You're both under arrest!

29:56.419 --> 29:58.463
This just shows you
how nothing's ever simple.

29:58.546 --> 30:01.382
Totally out of left field.
I totally wrote this debt off.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.010
I put this in my "you're never gonna
collect this debt

30:04.093 --> 30:05.512
in a million years" column.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.639
You know something? I just had a birthday.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.432
Happy birthday. How old are you?

30:09.516 --> 30:12.352
I just had a birthday waiting
for you to get to the point.

30:12.435 --> 30:14.270
In other words,
you didn't have a birthday?

30:14.354 --> 30:16.606
Come on. Will you tell me
what you're trying to tell me?

30:16.689 --> 30:18.650
What I'm telling you
is I get a windfall payment

30:18.733 --> 30:20.068
on a written-off debt.

30:20.151 --> 30:23.238
I happen to look at the currency
from which it'd just been paid.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.823
My heart sinks.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.158
The money's been dusted.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.451
What's the baggie for?

30:28.535 --> 30:31.579
What's the baggie for?
You haven't been watching the news.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.373
That powder could be a carcinogen.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.922
-What?
-What's your parole officer's number?

30:41.005 --> 30:42.715
What number? What are you talking about?

30:42.799 --> 30:44.926
What I'm talking about
is you're about to do a deal,

30:45.009 --> 30:46.469
and they fronted you marked money.

30:46.553 --> 30:49.055
-You're going back in, Sidney.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.974
Let me finish what I was telling you.

30:51.057 --> 30:54.811
-Fast. Come on.
-The rest is, I actually, uh...

30:55.854 --> 30:58.606
there may be an aspect of
a credit card transaction involved here.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.650
-I don't even remember.
-Where'd he get this?

31:01.568 --> 31:04.988
-It's a long story, Detective.
-Which he's in the process of making up.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.781
Looks like Jablonski's dough.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.158
Yeah. Talcum powder on new 20s.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.202
Can you put us with the guys
that gave you this?

31:11.286 --> 31:13.788
Two Caucasian gentlemen, middle-aged?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.290
Yeah, that's right.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.000
It's possible.

31:19.502 --> 31:20.837
Neal, you're up?

31:20.920 --> 31:22.797
-Hey, you're here. (coughs)
-(sighs)

31:22.881 --> 31:25.717
I could've done all of that for you.
I wish you'd let me help.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.428
Ooh.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.722
-Damn back.
-That's all right.

31:30.805 --> 31:33.099
What you need is someone
like me to take care of you.

31:33.182 --> 31:35.059
Everything at the apartment
is all fixed up,

31:35.143 --> 31:37.228
and I've got steaks for dinner.

31:37.312 --> 31:40.440
Hey, look, baby, I, uh, really.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.317
I'm dead.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.028
I want to go
to my own place tonight, okay?

31:47.155 --> 31:49.407
Okay. Sure.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.244
Hey, come on, Lynnetta. Leave that alone.

31:56.205 --> 31:59.250
-Neal, what's wrong?
-I don't know. I just...

32:00.251 --> 32:01.961
I can take care of my own things.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.630
I can take care of myself.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.590
-I know you can.
-Then let me, okay?

32:05.673 --> 32:07.884
-Okay.
-Look, I just got shot.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.887
-I nearly died.
-I knew this was gonna happen.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.805
Now you never want to see me
and Kenny again.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.182
There you go again.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.517
You always take everything to extremes.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.978
I was just planning on seeing
Kenny sometime next week.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.314
He loves you, Neal. We both do.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.441
Then you got to give me some space, okay?

32:24.150 --> 32:25.401
Okay.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.113
(exhales deeply)
Call me when you're ready?

32:30.073 --> 32:31.032
Okay.

32:31.741 --> 32:32.742
Will you?

32:34.202 --> 32:35.328
Maybe I will.

32:37.789 --> 32:38.957
Probably I will.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.168
80%, 85% probably?

32:42.251 --> 32:44.629
Aren't you the one always
talking percentages, Neal?

32:44.712 --> 32:47.423
You know, Lynnetta, I didn't want
to have to say any of this today.

32:47.507 --> 32:48.967
Well, at least let me take you home.

32:50.802 --> 32:51.803
No.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.389
Better if I take a cab.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.406
I heard Wash should be back
to work next week.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.199
Is that right? J.D. say that?

33:13.282 --> 33:15.660
Yeah, next week or the week after.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.036
He's going home tonight.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.914
-Hey, Renko.
-What?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.791
Your old pal Garrity.

33:22.750 --> 33:23.918
Uh-uh.

33:25.211 --> 33:27.422
-Look at it.
-Uh-huh.

33:27.505 --> 33:28.965
Stay with me, brother.

33:29.048 --> 33:31.384
(indistinct voices on radio)

33:36.472 --> 33:37.724
(tires squeal)

34:03.916 --> 34:05.376
Don't follow me, now.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.462
Where you going, Garrity?

34:07.545 --> 34:09.756
I just don't like being followed.
Do you understand?

34:09.839 --> 34:12.550
Then just get back in your van
and drive on out of this precinct.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.802
-You giving me orders?
-Call it what you like,

34:14.886 --> 34:17.430
but you ain't gonna drop
no more transients down here in the hill.

34:17.513 --> 34:19.599
I only take orders
from rank, not from you.

34:19.682 --> 34:22.143
I had captain taco telling me
how to run the street.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.812
Take them here and there,
spend my whole damn day in traffic

34:24.896 --> 34:25.813
with a bunch of gimps.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.483
Now orders from a mill-hick cop? No way.

34:28.566 --> 34:29.484
Uh-uh!

34:34.280 --> 34:36.074
Come on! End of the road!

34:36.824 --> 34:38.284
HILL: Don't do this, Garrity.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.912
Come on, get out of here.
End of the road! Come on!

34:40.995 --> 34:43.164
-Come on. Get lost.
-Get out!

34:43.247 --> 34:46.292
Hey, you put 'em back in that van, pal.

34:46.834 --> 34:48.544
What are you gonna do, twist my arm?

34:49.420 --> 34:51.172
-See ya.
-Aah!

34:52.215 --> 34:54.050
Yah! Come on!

34:55.426 --> 34:57.345
(grunting)

34:58.513 --> 34:59.680
-Take it easy!
-Renko!

34:59.764 --> 35:01.432
Ease off. That's enough!

35:01.516 --> 35:02.600
-Let go!
-Come on!

35:09.899 --> 35:11.526
Don't even try it.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.693
Aah!

35:12.777 --> 35:14.946
Renko! Renko! Renko!

35:15.029 --> 35:16.572
He's had enough! He's finished!

35:19.242 --> 35:21.160
Now, you listen to me, Garrity!

35:21.244 --> 35:24.247
I want you to take that van,
I want you to put them people in it,

35:24.330 --> 35:26.958
and you take 'em to a shelter!
You understand?

35:31.087 --> 35:33.923
I want you to do it today and every day,

35:34.006 --> 35:36.050
because I'm gonna be checking up on you.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.385
Every day!

35:39.804 --> 35:40.930
Come on.

35:44.016 --> 35:46.269
(dispatcher speaking over radio)

35:51.649 --> 35:54.694
-SID: <i>So, here we all are.</i>
-MAN: <i>Here we are.</i>

35:57.613 --> 35:59.157
You got the currency...

36:00.616 --> 36:03.995
-I got the plastic.
-Sounds like everything's everything.

36:04.078 --> 36:04.996
Let's take them.

36:05.079 --> 36:07.540
Uh, could we hang a minute, Lieutenant?

36:07.623 --> 36:09.500
I want to build
Sidney's character a little.

36:09.584 --> 36:13.296
Isn't it great
when everything goes just right?

36:15.214 --> 36:16.549
You got the money...

36:17.967 --> 36:20.511
(exhales deeply) I got the plastic.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.182
Yeah, that's fabulous.
So how about let's do it, hmm?

36:25.308 --> 36:27.310
(chuckles) I'm ready when you are.

36:27.393 --> 36:28.686
<i>So?</i>

36:34.609 --> 36:36.569
I think I'm gonna count the cash again.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.365
We've built enough character, J.D.

36:41.449 --> 36:44.410
You don't know this guy, Lieutenant.
He had a lot of character to build.

36:44.493 --> 36:45.953
Let's take them, guys.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.127
It's all there.

36:54.128 --> 36:55.588
But this, uh,

36:55.671 --> 36:58.424
this powdery substance on your currency

36:59.050 --> 37:01.802
could cause suspicion
in a cautious person.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.764
What is it with you? Got a problem, pal?

37:04.847 --> 37:06.098
Yeah.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.434
I don't want to get involved
with law enforcement.

37:08.517 --> 37:10.228
Hey, look.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.063
-Freeze.
-Let's go!

37:12.146 --> 37:13.648
GOLDBLUME: Hold it!

37:13.731 --> 37:15.149
Remember us, fellas, huh?

37:15.233 --> 37:17.235
We're the guys you nearly
ran down this morning.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.527
What is the problem, men?

37:18.611 --> 37:21.572
Conspiracy to commit fraud
and larceny by trick and device.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.074
Possession of stolen property.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.117
What? Possession of stolen what?

37:25.201 --> 37:26.994
These are the guys with marked money.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.039
-You morons! You fat brain.
-Let's move it.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.124
What the hell were you guys waiting for,

37:32.208 --> 37:33.668
the Johnstown flood?

37:35.753 --> 37:38.339
(telephones ringing)

37:39.465 --> 37:41.384
I'll take this one
down at the garden level.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.177
Be back in about ten minutes.

37:47.014 --> 37:50.142
I figure a C-note, on account
of the personal anguish.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.812
50 bucks and you're kicked
loose after the arraignment.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.065
Maybe the sarge would like
to contribute a small gratuity.

37:56.148 --> 37:57.400
Oh, yeah. Probably.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.410
I've intaked both Rabinowitzes.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.246
If you could see your way
to a release, Detective,

38:10.913 --> 38:12.999
Israel will return
the proper diamonds to Meyer,

38:13.082 --> 38:16.002
and Meyer will personally apologize to you
for the false confession.

38:17.044 --> 38:18.129
Okay.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.803
-Let's release these two.
-God bless you, Detective.

38:25.886 --> 38:28.389
I'm sorry, Detective Belker,
from my <i>kishkehs.</i>

38:28.472 --> 38:30.599
Stow it, hair breaths.

38:30.683 --> 38:34.103
Just don't get the cops involved
with this crap anymore.

38:38.858 --> 38:39.942
Look at that watch.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.237
So what? Am I supposed
to be impressed with a gold watch?

38:43.321 --> 38:44.488
4:38.

38:44.572 --> 38:47.742
-Okay, so you're done. That's great.
-Come here a minute.

38:47.825 --> 38:50.536
Hey, I'm glad you're done,
but I got a ton of work here.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.079
Come on. Two minutes.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.042
-Take it easy, pop.
-Oh, come on.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.085
You're gonna patronize me some more, huh?

38:58.169 --> 39:01.172
You think <i>pop </i>can't knock
the stuffing out of you, huh?

39:01.255 --> 39:02.256
Come on! Come on.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.257
Come on, try me.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.426
I need some help down here!

39:05.509 --> 39:07.970
You'd better calm down
or you're gonna have an aneurysm.

39:08.054 --> 39:11.265
Aneurysm? You think I'm gonna have
an aneurysm, punk, huh?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.933
You'd better get somebody down here,

39:13.017 --> 39:15.811
get this guy off me, before I kill him!

39:15.895 --> 39:17.396
Kill me, are ya?

39:18.356 --> 39:19.732
You're gonna kill? You--

39:19.815 --> 39:21.317
-(grunting)
-Hey! Hey!

39:21.400 --> 39:24.445
-Sarge! Take it easy!
-All right, buddy, back off here.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.197
Come down here before he pops a vessel.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.532
Anytime, punk. No problem.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.909
You hear me? Any time!

39:29.992 --> 39:32.119
(breathing heavily)

39:47.635 --> 39:48.761
(exhales sharply)

40:00.022 --> 40:01.190
You all right?

40:02.525 --> 40:03.692
(chuckles)

40:04.360 --> 40:06.529
Whose idea was this undercover, anyway?

40:08.197 --> 40:09.448
(chuckles)

40:11.117 --> 40:12.326
You're in business.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.204
When this building falls,
those pipes will be standing.

40:15.287 --> 40:16.664
What about the hole?

40:16.747 --> 40:19.834
That's for the plasterer.
Listen, take your time calling him.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.837
-I'd like everybody to see this.
-You're real proud of it, aren't you?

40:22.920 --> 40:26.006
Yeah, sure. Why not? I'm the best.
You know what I mean?

40:26.090 --> 40:29.051
You know, frankly, I would like
to punch you right in the mouth.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.512
Ooh, that sounds hot. Let's go.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.769
So, Detective Belker,
what about our undercover?

40:38.853 --> 40:41.355
You got a good case. Maybe next year.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.523
(chuckles)

40:43.566 --> 40:45.025
This morning, I, uh,

40:45.109 --> 40:47.653
I saw you eyeing some
of Meyer's stones, Detective.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.989
If you need something,

40:50.072 --> 40:53.159
a grateful Israel Rabinowitz
stands ready to serve,

40:53.242 --> 40:54.577
at 20% off wholesale.

40:54.660 --> 40:57.246
Make sure it's
the wholesale price for glass.

40:57.329 --> 40:59.748
Ha. Mr. Gouger speaks.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.501
-Whatever price he makes, I go lower.
-Spite merchant.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.336
-Briber!
-Sales-tax evader!

41:04.420 --> 41:05.796
Tell Detective about that one.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.591
-Not one dime in sales tax does he pay!
-Sales tax evader? You!

41:08.674 --> 41:10.217
You never deal the hot stones, huh?

41:10.301 --> 41:12.428
Shut up. Shut up!

41:12.511 --> 41:14.763
Both of you. Get out of here!

41:17.391 --> 41:18.559
I'll tell you what,

41:18.642 --> 41:19.852
I want a diamond,

41:19.935 --> 41:22.855
I'm gonna go to a department store
and pay retail!

41:26.734 --> 41:28.527
Uh, excuse me, Lieutenant.

41:28.611 --> 41:31.655
A group of us are going over to Hanrahan's
after shift this afternoon.

41:31.739 --> 41:34.200
-You care to join us?
-Yeah. Why not?

41:34.283 --> 41:36.368
Uh, you know,
just speaking for me and my partner,

41:36.452 --> 41:39.246
we really appreciate
the way you handled things this afternoon.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.166
-Yeah. We did pretty good.
-Yeah. See you later.

41:42.249 --> 41:43.292
Yeah.

41:45.127 --> 41:47.755
That's it, brisk, bold steps,

41:47.838 --> 41:50.716
but not overreaching and not falling back.

41:50.799 --> 41:53.677
A synchronous gait
that unites man and doggy

41:53.761 --> 41:56.764
in an orderly unit of motion.

41:56.847 --> 41:59.016
Good. Good. Very good.

41:59.099 --> 42:00.809
And now stop.

42:01.936 --> 42:05.648
You all did well, extremely well.

42:05.731 --> 42:07.233
And let them know it.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.817
Let them feel your affection.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.861
That's right. That's right.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.113
Pat them with good, firm hands.

42:13.197 --> 42:15.449
Yes. Yes, that's what they want to feel.

42:16.408 --> 42:17.952
Well, Lieutenant Hunter,

42:18.035 --> 42:20.996
you seemed very much
in tune with your animal.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.081
Oh, well, thank you.

42:22.164 --> 42:24.917
The Emperor Lao Tsu and I
have been working very hard.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.127
And, of course,
we'll continue the classes.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.879
Oh, then you weren't bored.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.924
I was so worried that I would
fall short of your standards.

42:32.007 --> 42:34.426
Oh, no, no, on the contrary.
You radiate a certain energy

42:34.510 --> 42:36.720
that I haven't felt since I was in OCS.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.348
I can't tell you
what your praise means to me.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.267
Well, when I thought of teaching obedience

42:41.350 --> 42:44.311
to a man of your own
remarkable background,

42:44.395 --> 42:49.984
I must admit that I was a tiny bit,
well, uncertain.

42:52.111 --> 42:55.573
Miss Ashton-Wilkes,
I promise you that you possess that...

42:56.156 --> 42:59.910
that ephemeral quality
that one rarely encounters

42:59.994 --> 43:03.247
outside the sphere of martial command.

43:03.956 --> 43:06.750
Oh, to hear that from you.

43:06.834 --> 43:09.587
(chuckles) Well, I meant it.

43:11.714 --> 43:12.798
Well, I, uh...

43:15.426 --> 43:17.261
I mustn't neglect the others.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.601
Oh, yes. Very good.

43:23.684 --> 43:24.810
(dog barks)

43:25.894 --> 43:27.146
(door rattling)

43:30.232 --> 43:31.150
Hi.

43:31.233 --> 43:33.402
Oh, you see, you should've
waited downstairs.

43:33.485 --> 43:36.697
-No, it's nothing. It's not heavy.
-No. I should be carrying this.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.073
It's light!

43:39.825 --> 43:41.952
Um, I want you to sit down for a second.

43:42.036 --> 43:44.663
-Just let me unpack.
-This will just take a minute. Come on.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.749
-Will you let me take off my coat?
-Sit.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.793
All right. What?

43:53.672 --> 43:55.716
I think the reason I've been so worried

43:56.675 --> 43:59.011
is because we're doing everything...

44:00.971 --> 44:01.972
I don't know.

44:02.056 --> 44:05.059
We're not doing things in the right order.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.769
What's that supposed to mean?

44:07.645 --> 44:08.604
Okay.

44:09.396 --> 44:11.106
You and me, we live together.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.150
Now we're gonna have a baby.

44:14.151 --> 44:16.820
And that's just not doing things
in the right order.

44:23.035 --> 44:23.911
Here.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.872
I stopped by Hoyle's on my way home.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.462
What do you think?

44:37.424 --> 44:38.425
It's beautiful.

44:39.885 --> 44:42.763
I don't mean about that.
What do you think about the <i>big thing?</i>

44:43.847 --> 44:45.182
The big thing?

44:46.809 --> 44:48.811
(both chuckle)

44:48.894 --> 44:50.354
You mean about us getting married?

44:50.938 --> 44:52.648
I didn't want to ask you that way.

44:54.775 --> 44:56.360
I wanted to do it this way.

44:57.528 --> 45:01.699
(sentimental music playing)

45:04.827 --> 45:06.328
I think we should be married.

45:17.548 --> 45:22.553
(wind blowing)

45:22.636 --> 45:24.263
Why didn't you come up, Ray?

45:24.346 --> 45:26.056
I wanted to talk out here.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.308
Could we walk? My car is up the block.

45:28.392 --> 45:29.476
What's up?

45:29.560 --> 45:31.353
I'm thinking of resigning, Frank.

45:31.437 --> 45:32.396
Why?

45:32.479 --> 45:36.066
Because for all my good intentions,
I simply am not good enough.

45:36.942 --> 45:38.902
I misjudge. I lose respect.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.071
It's a little soon.

45:41.155 --> 45:44.199
And I am so naive to request deliveries

45:44.283 --> 45:46.285
to a shelter two precincts away

45:46.368 --> 45:48.787
and not to expect
any problems from the men.

45:49.997 --> 45:50.956
Why did you?

45:51.039 --> 45:53.751
Obviously for the homeless on the streets.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.002
With the cold weather,

45:55.085 --> 45:57.337
with the increase
from the mental hospitals.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.881
Naive!

45:58.964 --> 46:01.800
You're upset, Ray,
and you're lacerating yourself.

46:01.884 --> 46:05.137
But really, it's too early for us to know
if you're made for the job.

46:06.555 --> 46:08.724
-What'd you do with Garrity?
-Board of Rights.

46:08.807 --> 46:11.143
Insubordination. Neglect of duty.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.103
Sounds in the ballpark to me.

46:13.187 --> 46:16.106
Everything you're telling me
about your command sounds reasonable.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.983
-Really?
-Really.

46:18.066 --> 46:20.402
Your late shelter deliveries
are a first-rate idea.

46:20.486 --> 46:21.653
I may try them myself.

46:23.071 --> 46:25.991
Also, I'd like to apologize
for this morning.

46:26.074 --> 46:28.368
Ray, you're too hard on yourself.

46:28.452 --> 46:31.538
In truth, I always model myself after you.

46:31.622 --> 46:32.623
Totally.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.084
I hold myself to your standards.

46:36.168 --> 46:38.837
Well, I've sure made plenty of mistakes,
and I haven't quit yet.

46:42.382 --> 46:43.884
Thank you. I understand.

46:51.183 --> 46:52.309
Good night, Ray.

46:55.270 --> 46:57.815
-(car door closes)
-(engine turns over)

47:04.321 --> 47:07.157
-I thought 301 died.
-It's a new occupant.

47:10.786 --> 47:12.663
-Manager!
-I told you there is no answer.

47:12.746 --> 47:14.373
Will you just open up the door, please?

47:15.415 --> 47:17.084
You sure this is police business?

47:17.835 --> 47:19.086
Yes.

47:31.265 --> 47:33.433
He's probably walking around
out there someplace.

47:33.517 --> 47:35.269
I'm worried something
might've happened to him.

47:35.352 --> 47:37.187
The only store I sent him to is closed.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.481
Don't worry about him, Officer.

47:40.107 --> 47:42.109
God always takes care of that kind.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.529
He's sure doing a good job with Toby.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.575
(siren wailing)

48:02.713 --> 48:07.009
(theme music playing)
