WEBVTT

00:04.456 --> 00:05.475
What are you doing?

00:05.476 --> 00:08.010
Oh, uh, Priya's calling
in a few minutes on Skype,

00:08.010 --> 00:10.178
and we are gonna have
a dinner date.

00:12.014 --> 00:14.482
It's 8:00 in the morning
in Mumbai.

00:14.484 --> 00:16.634
How can she have dinner?

00:16.636 --> 00:17.685
Fine, whatever.

00:17.687 --> 00:19.070
Priya will be having breakfast.

00:19.072 --> 00:22.306
All right, so technically
it's not a dinner date.

00:22.308 --> 00:25.826
I suppose you could call it
a, uh, dinfast date.

00:25.828 --> 00:27.912
But if you did,
you'd open yourself

00:27.914 --> 00:29.647
to peer-based mocking, such as,

00:29.649 --> 00:33.201
"Hey, Leonard, how was your
dinfast with Priya last night?"

00:33.203 --> 00:35.119
That doesn't sound like mocking.

00:35.121 --> 00:37.038
You didn't let me finish.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.090
Dinfast.

00:39.092 --> 00:41.158
Are those soy-based candles?

00:41.160 --> 00:42.710
I don't know. Why?

00:42.712 --> 00:45.630
Paraffin candles
may contain carcinogens.

00:45.632 --> 00:47.998
Unless lung cancer
is the ambiance

00:48.000 --> 00:50.468
you were going for
at your dinfast.

00:51.169 --> 00:52.803
Dinfast.

00:53.605 --> 00:55.389
Listen, I don't
want to be rude,

00:55.391 --> 00:57.275
but Priya's gonna be
calling any minute, so...

00:57.277 --> 00:59.143
Oh, yes, Priya.

00:59.145 --> 01:03.147
Leonard, you know
I make a point of

01:03.149 --> 01:06.033
never interfering
in your personal affairs.

01:08.353 --> 01:11.105
Yes, I've always
admired that about you.

01:11.107 --> 01:12.540
As well you should.

01:12.542 --> 01:14.825
But I'm going to make
an exception here.

01:14.827 --> 01:16.494
Oh, good.

01:16.496 --> 01:20.815
Priya has moved back to India
to pursue her law career.

01:20.817 --> 01:22.533
Instead of
desperately trying

01:22.535 --> 01:26.654
to keep this intercontinental
relationship alive,

01:26.656 --> 01:30.708
you could use that time
to take up a hobby.

01:30.710 --> 01:33.060
A hobby?

01:33.062 --> 01:34.395
Yes.

01:34.397 --> 01:37.648
I read recently
about a fellow in Kansas

01:37.650 --> 01:40.234
with an enormous
ball of twine.

01:42.037 --> 01:45.122
I bet you could give him
a run for his money.

01:45.124 --> 01:48.326
You know, some people
might say that it's great

01:48.328 --> 01:50.561
that we're trying to make
things work long distance.

01:50.563 --> 01:51.862
They'd say
things like,

01:51.864 --> 01:54.865
"Love is stronger than
the miles between you""

01:54.867 --> 01:59.620
When I rise to power,
those people will be sterilized.

01:59.622 --> 02:02.740
You video-chat with
Amy all the time.

02:02.742 --> 02:04.125
How is this different?

02:04.127 --> 02:05.626
Don't you like Amy?

02:05.628 --> 02:07.411
Of course I like Amy.

02:07.413 --> 02:08.713
Well, there's the difference.

02:10.749 --> 02:11.915
(Skype ringtone playing)

02:11.917 --> 02:14.251
Excuse me,
that's Priya.

02:14.253 --> 02:15.436
Hi, Leonard.

02:15.438 --> 02:16.437
Hey, honey.

02:16.439 --> 02:17.638
I miss you.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.839
Oh, I miss you, too.

02:18.841 --> 02:21.175
I miss the old days
when your romantic partners

02:21.177 --> 02:23.227
could be returned
to the video store.

02:26.264 --> 02:28.399
Thanks for
letting me stay here

02:28.401 --> 02:30.434
while Leonard
Skypes with his girlfriend.

02:30.436 --> 02:32.069
Oh, it's no problem.

02:32.071 --> 02:33.788
It's actually kind of nice.

02:33.790 --> 02:35.439
You reading, me reading.

02:35.441 --> 02:38.108
We're like an old
married couple.

02:38.110 --> 02:40.411
If we were
an old married couple,

02:40.413 --> 02:44.065
the wife would serve
iced tea and snickerdoodles.

02:44.067 --> 02:48.002
I don't have iced tea
and snickerdoodles.

02:48.804 --> 02:52.256
A good wife
would go to the store.

02:53.091 --> 02:55.643
I want a divorce.

02:55.645 --> 02:57.645
Good. On the way
to see the lawyer,

02:57.647 --> 02:59.513
pick up some tea and cookies.

03:00.349 --> 03:03.584
(both chuckle)

03:03.586 --> 03:07.271
I must say,
I am enjoying your new chair.

03:07.273 --> 03:08.639
It's great,
isn't it?

03:08.641 --> 03:09.640
It is.

03:09.642 --> 03:10.941
Aligns the lumbar,

03:10.943 --> 03:14.362
cradles the coccyx,
balances the buttocks.

03:14.364 --> 03:16.781
This is a chair
worthy of the name.

03:16.783 --> 03:17.865
What name?

03:19.534 --> 03:21.185
Chair.

03:22.987 --> 03:24.705
Oh, all right, well,
I'm glad you like it.

03:24.707 --> 03:26.507
I mean, I still can't
get over the fact

03:26.509 --> 03:27.875
someone just
threw it away.

03:29.728 --> 03:31.379
What?

03:31.381 --> 03:32.830
Yeah, it was just
sitting on the street.

03:32.832 --> 03:35.015
I paid a homeless guy ten bucks
to help me get it up here.

03:35.017 --> 03:36.717
(groans)

03:36.719 --> 03:40.688
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

03:40.690 --> 03:42.523
What is wrong?

03:42.525 --> 03:45.008
I've been sitting in garbage!

03:45.010 --> 03:47.545
Sheldon, take it easy.

03:47.547 --> 03:50.364
You take it easy! I need
to use your shower.

03:52.117 --> 03:55.453
I went into this marriage
with so much hope.

03:57.205 --> 03:59.507

I've never used a hydraulic
thermoforming press before.

Pretty sweet, huh?

04:34.246 --> 04:38.133
This little baby set
the university back 175 grand.

Oh, yeah.

04:48.492 --> 04:51.677
This is one good-looking panini.

04:53.132 --> 04:54.265
Hand me the tuna melt.

04:54.267 --> 04:55.283
Yep.

04:55.285 --> 04:58.453
Thank you.

04:58.455 --> 04:59.737
(machine hissing)

04:59.739 --> 05:03.074
How's it going with
the long-distance love affair?

05:03.076 --> 05:04.876
Not easy, but we're
making it work.

05:04.878 --> 05:07.495
(machine hisses loudly)

05:07.497 --> 05:10.131
When you say "making it work,"
does that include

05:10.133 --> 05:12.717
doing the cyber nasty?

05:12.719 --> 05:13.835
What?

05:13.837 --> 05:16.421
You know,
the virtual pickle tickle.

♪ Bow-chicka-bow-bow. ♪

05:20.677 --> 05:22.594
Come on, dude.

05:22.596 --> 05:24.345
This is my sister
you're talking about.

05:24.347 --> 05:26.648
Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk
at her through a webcam

05:26.650 --> 05:28.966
has got to be easier
for you to deal with

05:28.968 --> 05:31.019
than him actually
touching her with it.

05:32.304 --> 05:33.821
There's no junk jiggling.

05:33.823 --> 05:35.139
We just talk.

05:35.141 --> 05:36.991
Are you sane?

05:36.993 --> 05:39.277
With high-speed Internet,
you have at your fingertips

05:39.279 --> 05:41.029
the greatest advancement
in the field of sex

05:41.031 --> 05:44.015
since the invention
of the washcloth.

05:45.868 --> 05:46.868
I can't do that.

05:46.870 --> 05:48.703
(chuckles)
Well, if you don't,

05:48.705 --> 05:52.206
you're gonna lose Priya
to some fancy guy in a turban

05:52.208 --> 05:55.126
who grew up with
Kama Sutra coloring books.

05:55.128 --> 05:57.495
How can you
be so racist?

05:57.497 --> 05:59.714
Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.

06:00.549 --> 06:01.716
Oh, Leonard, good.

06:01.718 --> 06:02.850
There you are.

06:02.852 --> 06:05.853
I need you to check my head
for chair lice.

06:05.855 --> 06:09.674
I did it last night,
I'm not doing it again.

06:09.676 --> 06:12.393
Just his head, right?

06:12.395 --> 06:15.863
I don't want
to talk about it.

06:17.283 --> 06:19.567
You didn't catch bugs
from Penny's chair.

06:19.569 --> 06:20.985
Yes, I did.

06:20.987 --> 06:23.321
And now they're cavorting
at the base of my hair follicles

06:23.323 --> 06:26.858
like dancing hippies
at the Redwood National Forest.

06:26.860 --> 06:30.194
Sheldon, you do this
all the time.

06:30.196 --> 06:32.330
You fixate on some crazy idea

06:32.332 --> 06:34.132
and then blow it
way out of proportion.

06:34.134 --> 06:36.334
Name one time
I've ever done that.

06:39.305 --> 06:41.889
How about when you put
GPS trackers in your garbage

06:41.891 --> 06:43.808
because you were convinced
North Korean spies

06:43.810 --> 06:45.777
were stealing your doodles?

06:46.845 --> 06:50.081
The chicken nuggets you were
sure were human nuggets.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.266
The strangely-shaped cloud

06:52.268 --> 06:54.936
that was following you
around town.

06:56.388 --> 06:58.356
The time you put on
my shirt by mistake

06:58.358 --> 07:01.159
and were convinced
you'd started growing again.

07:01.161 --> 07:03.161
I said, "Name one."

07:03.163 --> 07:05.530
You really need to work on
your listening skills.

07:09.451 --> 07:11.235
Penny.

07:11.237 --> 07:13.087
Penny. Penny.

07:13.089 --> 07:15.590
Yello.

07:15.592 --> 07:17.759
You need to remove that
chair from the building.

07:17.761 --> 07:19.427
It's a health hazard.

07:19.429 --> 07:21.262
Okay, relax.
I took off the slipcovers,

07:21.264 --> 07:23.264
had them dry-cleaned and then
fumigated the cushions.

07:23.266 --> 07:24.832
Really?

07:24.834 --> 07:26.267
Yeah. It's cleaner
than my couch.

07:26.269 --> 07:28.936
Found half a Hot Pocket
in there.

07:35.093 --> 07:37.245
It certainly looks okay.

07:39.031 --> 07:41.232
Has a strong toxic
chemical smell.

07:41.234 --> 07:42.900
That's reassuring.

07:42.902 --> 07:45.820
Why don't you give
it a try, Sheldon?

07:48.106 --> 07:49.657
All right.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.881
(sighs softly)

07:56.883 --> 07:59.100
It is a comfortable chair.

07:59.102 --> 08:02.253
Why don't you just admit
you overreacted?

08:02.255 --> 08:04.172
No, thank you.

08:10.813 --> 08:14.015
(insects chittering)

08:18.303 --> 08:19.687
(gasps)

08:21.490 --> 08:23.775
(door slams)

08:23.777 --> 08:27.462
It's like living with
a Chihuahua.

08:29.314 --> 08:30.981
Penny.

08:30.983 --> 08:33.501
Penny. Penny.

08:33.503 --> 08:35.753
What's up, buttercup?

08:35.755 --> 08:37.839
You have to get rid
of the chair.

08:37.841 --> 08:39.357
Nope.

08:42.294 --> 08:43.510
Penny.

08:43.513 --> 08:45.046
Penny. Penny.

08:45.048 --> 08:47.765
What's the word, hummingbird?

08:47.767 --> 08:51.936
For your safety,
please wait in my apartment

08:51.938 --> 08:54.522
as I call the authorities
so they may remove

08:54.524 --> 08:56.524
the chair of death.

08:56.526 --> 08:59.193
No.

09:01.029 --> 09:02.230
Penny!

09:02.232 --> 09:04.014
Penny! Penny!

09:04.016 --> 09:07.568
What's the gist, physicist?

09:09.354 --> 09:13.357
Under my authority
as a self-appointed member

09:13.359 --> 09:15.710
of the Centers for
Disease Control street team...

09:17.028 --> 09:18.913
...these premises are condemned.

09:19.998 --> 09:20.965
(stutters)

09:20.967 --> 09:26.036
As a man with a keen
sense of style,

09:26.038 --> 09:30.007
I must tell you, that chair
does not work with the room.

09:33.512 --> 09:34.595
Penny!

09:34.597 --> 09:35.847
Penny!

09:35.849 --> 09:38.032
(screams)

09:41.019 --> 09:42.553
Penny.

09:46.634 --> 09:48.446
So, here we are.

09:48.447 --> 09:49.813
Back in bed together.

09:49.815 --> 09:52.900
Yep, here we are.

09:54.769 --> 09:55.869
(clears throat)

09:55.871 --> 09:59.106
Okay, so I-I guess
I'll just jump right in.

09:59.108 --> 10:00.407
All right.

10:02.243 --> 10:06.463
Uh, you're a naughty girl.

10:07.599 --> 10:12.770
And-And, uh, I-I want
to punish you with my love?

10:15.090 --> 10:16.924
What?

10:16.926 --> 10:18.575
Not good?

10:18.577 --> 10:20.477
That's terrible. Try again.

10:20.479 --> 10:21.478
Okay.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.265
Uh, uh, you're... not naughty.

10:25.267 --> 10:28.235
Uh, you're-you're-you're dirty.

10:28.237 --> 10:30.637
You're...

10:30.639 --> 10:33.807
You're a-a dirty girl?

10:33.809 --> 10:35.659
Oh, yes.

10:35.661 --> 10:37.161
Yes, I am.

10:37.163 --> 10:38.162
Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay.

10:38.164 --> 10:40.864
You're a, you're a...

10:40.866 --> 10:43.584
You're a-a dirty...

10:43.586 --> 10:46.153
disgusting...

10:46.155 --> 10:48.422
revolting girl.

10:48.424 --> 10:51.375
Ugh!

10:51.377 --> 10:54.077
God, Leonard, stop talking.

10:54.079 --> 10:56.213
Why don't you just give me
five minutes?

10:56.215 --> 10:59.299
I'll Google how to do this.
I'll call you right back.

10:59.301 --> 11:02.336
Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet
and do what I tell you.

11:02.338 --> 11:04.888
Okay, like usual. Good.

11:04.890 --> 11:06.857
Take off your shirt.

11:06.859 --> 11:10.227
All rightie. Shirt coming off.

11:12.814 --> 11:16.283
Ta-da! Man nipples. (chuckles)

11:16.285 --> 11:17.684
I said be quiet.

11:17.686 --> 11:19.736
Yes, ma'am.

11:19.738 --> 11:22.355
Now take off your shorts.

11:22.357 --> 11:25.742
Taking shorts off.

11:27.162 --> 11:28.862
There we go.

11:28.864 --> 11:31.748
Naked, naked, naked!

11:31.750 --> 11:33.250
Wonderful.

11:33.252 --> 11:35.169
Now I'll take off my clothes.

11:35.171 --> 11:37.855
Cool.

11:43.211 --> 11:45.095
Uh-oh!

11:46.898 --> 11:48.565
Here I am, baby.

11:48.567 --> 11:50.667
You miss these?

11:50.669 --> 11:52.502
Oh, damn it!

11:52.504 --> 11:54.171
Oh, Leonard! Already?

11:54.173 --> 11:56.406
No, no! No-no-no!

11:59.694 --> 12:01.828
The screen froze.

12:01.830 --> 12:03.914
It's probably just buffering
Just give it a second.

12:03.916 --> 12:05.349
Fine.

12:11.956 --> 12:15.926
So, how are your mom and dad?

12:15.928 --> 12:18.545
Yeah, I really don't want to
talk about my parents now.

12:18.547 --> 12:20.413
Yeah. Sure, sure.

12:21.849 --> 12:23.250
SHELDON:
If your video's frozen,

12:23.252 --> 12:27.437
try resetting
the TCP/IP stack.

12:27.439 --> 12:28.805
Oh...!

12:30.024 --> 12:32.059
I didn't even think of that.
Thanks.

12:32.061 --> 12:34.061
You're welcome.
Please let me know when

12:34.063 --> 12:35.612
you and your girlfriend
are done

12:35.614 --> 12:37.614
hogging the bandwidth
for your self-abuse.

12:37.616 --> 12:41.818
I'm trying to stream
a movie on Netflix in here.

12:43.037 --> 12:44.755
Five, six, seven, eight.

12:44.757 --> 12:47.941

and lovely ♪

12:47.943 --> 12:51.545

♪ Oh... ♪

13:07.145 --> 13:09.896
You are aware that your
ritualistic knocking behavior is

compulsive disorder?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.967
Is not.

13:13.969 --> 13:15.569
Is not, is not.

13:16.637 --> 13:19.022
Denial. Denial, denial.
Come in.

13:19.024 --> 13:20.907
Thank you.

13:20.909 --> 13:22.492
Would you like to hear me play

13:22.494 --> 13:24.328
a bossa nova standard
on the harp?

13:24.330 --> 13:26.196
No.

13:26.198 --> 13:27.531
How about the theme song

13:27.533 --> 13:29.649
to the classic television show
<i>Diff'rent Strokes?</i>

13:29.651 --> 13:31.752

13:31.754 --> 13:33.086

13:34.822 --> 13:37.841
Well, that's every song
I know. What's up?

13:37.843 --> 13:40.677
You're good friends with Penny,
right?

13:40.679 --> 13:43.663
Best friends, besties, BFFs,
peas in a pod,

13:43.665 --> 13:46.600
sisters who would share
traveling pants. Go on.

13:46.602 --> 13:48.501
I was hoping

13:48.503 --> 13:52.105
she might listen to you
about the dangers

13:52.107 --> 13:54.741
of owning unhygienic
furniture.

13:54.743 --> 13:57.944
For general educational
purposes, or has she acquired

13:57.946 --> 13:59.846
a bar stool dipped in cholera?

13:59.848 --> 14:03.700
Cholera is water-borne.
You're mocking me.

14:03.702 --> 14:06.036
Yes, I am.

14:06.038 --> 14:08.755
Penny has dragged a chair in
off the street

14:08.757 --> 14:11.191
whose unknown provenance
jeopardizes

14:11.193 --> 14:12.192
the health and welfare

14:12.194 --> 14:14.044
of every resident in
our building.

14:14.046 --> 14:17.197
Sheldon, just because you have
a focus on cleanliness

14:17.199 --> 14:18.215
bordering on the psychotic

14:18.217 --> 14:20.384
doesn't mean
I have to participate.

14:20.386 --> 14:23.954
All right, name your price.

14:25.807 --> 14:29.626
Kiss me where I've never
been kissed before.

14:29.628 --> 14:34.531
You mean like Salt Lake City?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.401
Never mind. I'll talk to Penny.

14:37.403 --> 14:38.802
Thank you.

14:38.804 --> 14:41.021
Will you listen to me
play my harp now?

14:41.023 --> 14:43.607
No. I dislike the sound
of the harp.

14:43.609 --> 14:46.626
Its overuse in classic
television sitcoms

14:46.628 --> 14:47.828
always makes me think

14:47.830 --> 14:50.831
I'm going to experience
an episode from my past.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.032
(plays glissando)

14:52.034 --> 14:53.733
I'm sorry, Mommy.
Don't be mad at me.

14:53.735 --> 14:55.469
Don't do that!

14:59.173 --> 15:00.674
I don't know about this, Howard.

15:00.676 --> 15:02.392
What? You're having
trouble

15:02.394 --> 15:04.094
with the long-distance
lovemaking.

15:04.096 --> 15:06.129
This is your answer.

15:06.131 --> 15:07.381
There are two
interfaces

15:07.383 --> 15:08.715
that simulate
a human mouth.

15:08.717 --> 15:11.435
You have one,
Priya has one in India.

15:11.437 --> 15:13.103
When you move your lips
and tongue on yours,

15:13.105 --> 15:15.806
it transmits exactly
what you're doing to hers.

15:15.808 --> 15:18.091
See? Internet kissing.

15:25.599 --> 15:27.150
Give it a try.

15:27.152 --> 15:29.870
I don't think so.

15:30.488 --> 15:32.539
I'll try it.

15:37.278 --> 15:38.945
Like this?

15:38.947 --> 15:41.948
Almost. Really get
your tongue in there.

15:41.950 --> 15:43.783
to activate the motion sensor.

15:43.785 --> 15:46.837
Like this?

15:46.839 --> 15:49.256
Close. Really French it.

15:57.732 --> 15:58.815
Better?

15:58.817 --> 16:01.518
Yeah, you got it, you got it.

16:03.304 --> 16:06.639
I'm impressed.
This is very lifelike.

16:06.641 --> 16:09.693
Whoa! You just bit my tongue!

16:09.695 --> 16:12.362
I-I nibbled.
I was being playful.

16:13.831 --> 16:16.950
Why do you have to make
everything weird?

16:16.952 --> 16:18.201
Sorry.

16:22.206 --> 16:24.157
Better?

16:24.159 --> 16:25.709
Oh, yeah.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.800
Pretty cool, huh?

16:33.802 --> 16:36.836
Probably would cost, like,
200 bucks in a store.

16:36.838 --> 16:38.305
I do appreciate
a bargain.

16:38.307 --> 16:41.942
This entire ensemble once
belonged to my dead grandmother.

16:41.944 --> 16:42.893
You're kidding.

16:42.895 --> 16:45.111
Everything except bra
and panties.

16:45.113 --> 16:49.399
And they're a leopard-spotted
secret I share with Victoria.

16:49.401 --> 16:52.152
And now me.

16:52.154 --> 16:55.855
I just have one question
about the chair.

16:55.857 --> 16:57.240
And what's that?

16:57.242 --> 17:00.494
Aren't you worried about it
being unhygienic?

17:02.046 --> 17:04.696
No, it's completely fine...

17:04.699 --> 17:08.451
Hmm. I get it.

17:08.453 --> 17:09.502
Sheldon sent you.

17:09.505 --> 17:10.720
He put you up to this.

17:10.722 --> 17:12.005
- No, he didn't.
- Really?

17:12.007 --> 17:14.974
Yes, he did.
He absolutely did.

17:14.977 --> 17:18.528
My God, Amy, that's really
crappy of you.

17:18.530 --> 17:19.878
It is?

17:19.881 --> 17:22.482
Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you
to manipulate me?

17:22.483 --> 17:23.883
I thought you were my friend.

17:23.885 --> 17:26.569
No, I am your friend.
Please don't be mad at me.

17:26.571 --> 17:27.570
I can't even believe this.

17:27.573 --> 17:29.222
You know, maybe you
should just go.

17:29.224 --> 17:32.046
No! No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I take it all back! Look!

17:32.047 --> 17:33.756
I'm, uh, I'm sitting in your
chair.

17:33.757 --> 17:35.162
There's nothing wrong
with it. It's a great chair.

17:35.163 --> 17:38.231
Please let me continue
to be part of your world.

17:38.233 --> 17:39.899
Ow!

17:39.901 --> 17:41.268
What's wrong?

17:41.270 --> 17:43.620
Something in the chair's
biting my tushy.

17:43.622 --> 17:44.904
It's not important. Ow!

17:44.906 --> 17:46.756
Wait. Get up, get up!

17:47.625 --> 17:57.250
(both screaming)

17:57.252 --> 17:59.586
Swear you won't tell
Sheldon what happened!

17:59.588 --> 18:01.021
I swear!

18:01.023 --> 18:04.757
(screaming)

18:04.759 --> 18:07.093
Can I tell my doctor?
I'm probably gonna need shots!

18:07.095 --> 18:08.945
Yeah, sure!

18:08.947 --> 18:11.514
(screaming continues)

18:14.568 --> 18:17.065
Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured
this thing out.

18:17.066 --> 18:18.432
Oh, Leonard, listen...

18:18.434 --> 18:20.284
No, you listen!
You're my woman,

18:20.286 --> 18:21.819
and I'm gonna
make you feel things

18:21.821 --> 18:23.955
you have never felt before.

18:23.957 --> 18:25.740
Leonard...

18:25.742 --> 18:27.074
That's right, say my name...

18:27.076 --> 18:28.793
and beg me for more, 'cause...

18:28.795 --> 18:32.179
I'm gonna give it to you.

18:33.832 --> 18:35.633
My parents are here.

18:39.671 --> 18:41.138
Hello, Leonard...

18:41.140 --> 18:44.842
if I may also
say your name.

18:49.631 --> 18:51.816
Check it out.
Free chair.

18:51.818 --> 18:53.267
Yeah.

18:53.269 --> 18:55.736
Hey, you know, if this was in
Sheldon and Leonard's apartment,

18:55.738 --> 18:58.472
I wouldn't wind up sitting on
the floor all the time.

18:58.474 --> 19:00.992
On three?

19:02.194 --> 19:03.277
(chuckles)

19:03.279 --> 19:05.446
Three!
Three!

19:05.448 --> 19:09.333
What kind of idiot throws away
a terrific chair like this?
