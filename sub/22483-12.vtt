00:08.625 --> 00:11.417
Moving day. Boy, I'm really
gonna miss this house.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.792
Thank you so much,
Mom and Dad.

00:12.792 --> 00:16.583
I don't know what we would've
done without you. Oh.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.166
-Thanks, Dad.
-Oh, well, you would've
stayed in a hotel

00:18.250 --> 00:21.083
with the insurance money
allocated for that purpose.

00:21.166 --> 00:22.875
Oh, no, this worked out
way better.

00:22.959 --> 00:24.667
And to show you our
appreciation, I want you to be

00:24.750 --> 00:25.834
on the lookout for a little

00:25.917 --> 00:27.917
-special delivery
thank-you gift.
-Mmm.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.041
-Oh, you guys not moving back
in's all the thanks we need.
-(chuckles)

00:31.125 --> 00:32.959
(laughs) Very funny, Dad.

00:33.041 --> 00:34.000
It's John.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.667
Right. John. Right.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.375
SOPHIA:
Miss you guys.

00:37.458 --> 00:38.625
Bye, Poop-Poop.

00:38.709 --> 00:40.291
Who taught you that?

00:44.750 --> 00:46.834
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:46.917 --> 00:48.125
What's in the box?

00:48.208 --> 00:49.709
Uh, the new toilet you ordered.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.500
Oh, I didn't order that.

00:51.583 --> 00:55.166
Oh! That might be a present
from my stupid son-in-law.

00:55.250 --> 00:58.417
It makes sense. He's put
a lot of miles on our toilet.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.333
(chuckles)
Well, he must like you.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.500
It's one of those fancy
Japanese electric deals.

01:02.583 --> 01:04.166
(laughs)

01:04.250 --> 01:06.625
Ah, that reminds me of a joke.

01:06.709 --> 01:08.792
-Are you Japanese?
-I am.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.959
Then never mind.

Must everything be robotic?

01:26.291 --> 01:29.542
Please, get this out of the
house before it drowns us all.

01:29.625 --> 01:31.625
But this was a thank-you gift
from Tim and Heather.

01:31.709 --> 01:34.208
It took me five hours
to sync up our phones.

01:34.291 --> 01:36.250
You gave this my number?

01:36.333 --> 01:37.917
I don't want a toilet
calling me.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.375
Oh, she won't.

01:39.458 --> 01:42.125
Um, but she will warm
your butt cheeks.

01:42.208 --> 01:44.583
While she's reading you a book.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.458
Hop on.

01:46.542 --> 01:48.625
She's on the second chapter
of <i>Mockingjay.</i>

01:48.709 --> 01:51.041
I will not "hop on."

01:51.125 --> 01:54.500
You know how I feel about peeing
on something with a name.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.750
Oh, come on, Joanie.
Give Tomo a chance.

01:56.834 --> 01:58.750
Just one little tinkle,
that's all I ask.

01:58.834 --> 02:01.542
I tinkle on my terms.

02:03.959 --> 02:05.959
Aw.

02:06.041 --> 02:08.834
I'm sorry, Tomo.
She'll come around.

02:08.917 --> 02:10.417
But, in the meantime...

02:11.667 --> 02:15.291
...I got a little something
special for you.

02:15.375 --> 02:17.583
Hey, you ordered those
bobbleheads of our family

02:17.667 --> 02:19.417
as a thank-you gift
for my parents, right?

02:19.500 --> 02:20.917
Yeah, I worked really hard on
the one for your dad--

02:21.000 --> 02:22.709
I'm sorry, Mr. Short--

02:22.792 --> 02:25.333
but I'm sure he's gonna hate it
just like he hates me.

02:25.417 --> 02:28.083
No! I can't hold anymore.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.875
When I buy myself
a $2,000 Japanese toilet,

02:29.959 --> 02:32.542
you'd think they'd have better
customer service.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.792
You spent $2,000 on a toilet?

02:34.875 --> 02:37.083
Well, yeah, people spend half
their lives on the toilet.

02:37.166 --> 02:39.291
No, babe, that's just you.

02:44.125 --> 02:47.166
Oh. Hey, Da... I mean, John.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.208
Oh. Tim,
thank you for my present.

02:49.291 --> 02:51.709
It's taught me so much
about myself.

02:51.792 --> 02:53.667
-It came already? Man,
that was fast.
-Mm-hmm.

02:53.750 --> 02:56.208
Hey, what did you think of the
"John?" It looks perfect, right?

02:56.291 --> 02:58.166
Are you kidding?
It's more than perfect.

02:58.250 --> 03:00.125
Joanie's a little
afraid of it, though.

03:00.208 --> 03:01.500
She thinks it's out to get her.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.500
(laughs)
It's that lifelike?

03:03.583 --> 03:05.000
It's like it has a soul.

03:05.083 --> 03:08.291
I felt so elated
when I sat on it.

03:08.375 --> 03:10.709
-Oh.
-Yeah.

03:10.792 --> 03:12.458
Cool, yeah, well, whatever.

03:12.542 --> 03:13.750
I'm sure Joanie's
gonna love it, too,

03:13.834 --> 03:15.375
once I convince
her to sit on it.

03:15.458 --> 03:19.959
You know, deep down I always
knew she was a little freaky.

03:38.750 --> 03:42.000
Ooh. Mmm.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.542
Hey, I just got off the phone
with the delivery company,

03:47.625 --> 03:50.041
and they said my toilet
was shipped here.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.834
Duh. I already thanked you
for that.

03:52.917 --> 03:56.625
In fact, I just got off a
30-minute wash and wax. Whoo.

03:56.709 --> 03:59.125
-Oh, no, John, that toilet
wasn't meant f...
-JOAN: John.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.041
I just tried the super-toilet.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.834
(chuckles)
And you were right.

04:03.917 --> 04:05.625
I feel warm

04:05.709 --> 04:07.583
and I feel loved in a way

04:07.667 --> 04:10.041
that nobody's ever loved me.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.375
Wait. B-But Joan,
you don't understand.

04:12.458 --> 04:15.959
No, I didn't, but now, I do.

like that anymore.

You can always stay here,

04:35.750 --> 04:36.959
Please.

04:37.041 --> 04:38.792
Call me Dad.

04:38.875 --> 04:41.041
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:41.125 --> 04:44.458
Okay. Well, Dad,
here's the thing, uh...

04:44.542 --> 04:45.834
Mm-hmm?

04:46.792 --> 04:48.709
(sighs) You're welcome.

04:48.792 --> 04:50.583
Just use it in good health.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.041
Well, thank you.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.041
Look, uh, a bunch of
bobbleheads came today.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.166
Um, did you order these,

04:57.250 --> 04:59.458
or did I piss off another gypsy?

04:59.542 --> 05:01.250
Oh, tho... No, those
are creepy, you know.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.000
I don't know what those are,
but I'll... You know what?

05:03.083 --> 05:04.500
Just give them to me,
I'll throw them in the...

05:04.583 --> 05:05.750
No, it's all right.
I'll take them out

05:05.834 --> 05:07.333

05:31.542 --> 05:34.000
Oh, hey, sweetie.
How was school?

05:34.083 --> 05:36.291
Well,
my most basic childhood instinct

05:36.375 --> 05:38.291
is urging me to say "fine,"

05:38.375 --> 05:39.917
but if I'm being honest,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.375
I had an emotionally rich day.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.500
Wow. I wasn't ready for that.

05:44.583 --> 05:45.917
What happened today?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.625
Well, a bunch of my friends
were talking

05:47.709 --> 05:49.375
about how they shaved their legs

05:49.458 --> 05:50.625
and how that changed
their lives.

05:50.709 --> 05:52.875
But then Jared Shuman

05:52.959 --> 05:54.625
had a seizure in computer lab

05:54.709 --> 05:57.500
-and ruined $50, 000 worth
of equipment.
-(gasps)

05:57.583 --> 05:59.208
Oh, my God.

05:59.291 --> 06:01.583
Girls in your class
are shaving their legs?

06:01.667 --> 06:05.417
Yup. They said it cut their
sleeping bag entry time in half.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.834
I think I'm gonna go
start shaving mine, too.

06:07.917 --> 06:10.417
Uh, whoa, hey. Yeah,
not in my house, you're not.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.542
Well, what about Mom-Mom
and Pop-Pop's house?

06:12.625 --> 06:15.542
Pop-Pop has a toilet
that plays "Let It Go."

06:15.625 --> 06:16.875
Yeah, nobody's house. Okay?

06:16.959 --> 06:18.375
You're just way too young.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.208
But everyone's gonna make fun
of me.

06:20.291 --> 06:22.959
-I'm gonna be the hairiest kid
in school.
-No.

06:23.041 --> 06:25.208
That is so not true.
What about that sixth grader

06:25.291 --> 06:27.208
with the sideburns
that go all the way down?

06:27.291 --> 06:28.917
They connect with his beard.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.542
Chewbacca? The lunch...
That's the lunch lady.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.583
Oh.

06:32.667 --> 06:33.709
Come on, Mom.

06:33.792 --> 06:35.166
You are still way too young

06:35.250 --> 06:36.542
to shave your legs.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.166
End of story.

That is incredibly sweet
that you still bring Tyler

06:45.333 --> 06:48.709
a cup of coffee even
after your breakup.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.792
-Well, some couples like
to keep things fresh.
-Mmm.

06:50.875 --> 06:52.542

to keep them confusing.

-Okay.

HEATHER:
What's with the jeans
under the dress?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.000
Is that some sort
of weird gender statement?

07:01.083 --> 07:02.917
Please help me
before I say the wrong thing.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.667
I think you've already said
the wrong thing.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.500
I'm just trying
to avoid the ridicule

07:07.583 --> 07:09.667
of my freshly-shaven peers.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.000
-Oh.
-See you after school,

07:11.083 --> 07:13.417
if I'm not shoved in a locker.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.166
Okay.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.375
(door shuts)

07:16.458 --> 07:19.458
Hey, how old were you
when you started shaving?

07:19.542 --> 07:21.959
Oh, I'm just naturally
hairless from the neck down.

07:22.041 --> 07:23.583
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.000
Get out.

07:27.291 --> 07:30.000
-Sophia?!
-Over here,

07:30.083 --> 07:31.375
-Sophia's Mom!
-Oh, God.

07:31.458 --> 07:34.417
Oh, honey!
What happened? Are you hurt?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.917
Do I need to threaten to sue the
school again? 'Cause I'll do it.

07:37.709 --> 07:39.208
Beverly here. Team manager.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.667
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.083
Yeah, hi. (chuckles)

07:42.166 --> 07:44.208
Looks like we got a classic case
of overheating.

07:44.291 --> 07:45.250
The orange slice

07:45.333 --> 07:46.625
is on the way.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.250
Okay, good. Well, you know what,

07:48.333 --> 07:51.083
you can't play soccer
in your jeans.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.333
-Can I shave my legs then?
-No.

07:53.417 --> 07:55.667
Well, then it looks like Beverly
and I are gonna be spending

07:55.750 --> 07:58.000
a lot more time together
this season.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.333
Yes!

07:59.417 --> 08:00.917
Mm.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.291
-Oh!
-(sputters)

08:05.000 --> 08:06.750
(grunts)

08:08.291 --> 08:10.375
Honey, don't you want
to take those off?

08:10.458 --> 08:11.917
Nobody here's gonna judge you,
okay?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.375
I think the denim
is really weighing you down.

08:14.458 --> 08:16.083
It's just the weight
of my leg hair.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.709
Oh, Sophia.

08:17.792 --> 08:19.667
Besides...

08:19.750 --> 08:21.083
(grunts)

08:21.166 --> 08:23.083
...this is what Pop-Pop wears
to swim.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.000
Right, Pop-Pop?

08:25.083 --> 08:29.125
It's easier
than putting on sunscreen.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.542
-(knocking)
-Hey. Can I come in?

08:31.625 --> 08:34.041
Sure.

08:36.875 --> 08:39.834
Oh, those are still fully wet.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.250
Pop-Pop said it's best
to let them dry <i>on </i>you,

08:42.333 --> 08:44.458
-so that they form a casing.
-Mm.

08:44.542 --> 08:47.000
Yeah. Okay, listen, sweetie.

08:47.083 --> 08:50.500
As hard as it is for me to watch
my little girl become a woman,

08:50.583 --> 08:53.000
it is so much harder
for me to watch you suffer.

08:53.083 --> 08:55.917
So... you can shave your legs.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.750
-Thanks, Mom!
-Oh. Mm.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.166
All right, come on, let's go.
I'll show you how to

09:01.250 --> 09:02.250
do it in the bathtub.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.291
Uh, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.208
Oh, no, no, no. We are
gonna go in there and make some

09:06.291 --> 09:08.083
very beautiful mother-daughter
memories together, okay?

09:08.166 --> 09:09.667
So, let's get those pants off.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.166
Yeah, I'm cool. Maybe later.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.500
Sophia. Take your pants off.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.250
Let's go. I'm gonna
teach you how to shave.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.542
No.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.542
-Take your pants off, Sophia.
-No.

09:20.625 --> 09:21.834
-Why won't you take your...
-No!

09:21.917 --> 09:22.959
-No, no, no.
-I'm your... Yes. I am gonna

09:23.041 --> 09:24.667
teach you how to shave
your legs.

09:24.750 --> 09:25.959
-Jeans off.
-No, thank you.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.417
-Why won't you take
your pants off?
-Mother!

09:27.500 --> 09:28.875
Because...

09:28.959 --> 09:31.542
I already shaved.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.041
Oh! With what?! A machete?

09:34.125 --> 09:35.875
No. Dad's back razor.

09:35.959 --> 09:38.834
That's why I've been
wearing the jeans.

09:38.917 --> 09:41.000
-It was a bloodbath, Mom.
-Ugh.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.041
You're lucky I'm still standing.

09:43.125 --> 09:46.208
And before you get upset,
just know that I never want

09:46.291 --> 09:48.125
to shave again, so you win.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.875
Besides, I mean, my hair was
pretty blonde to begin with.

09:51.959 --> 09:55.542
Oh. Hmm. Sophia, don't you know
that once you start shaving,

09:55.625 --> 09:59.000
your hair comes back darker
and thicker?

09:59.083 --> 10:00.166
What?

10:00.250 --> 10:01.542
Yeah. Look at this.

10:01.625 --> 10:03.291
I just shaved at lunch.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.250
No.

10:05.333 --> 10:06.959
Welcome to womanhood, honey.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.291
(knocking)

10:14.375 --> 10:16.709
(knocking continues)

10:16.792 --> 10:19.667
-Greg.
-(hissing) Don't answer it.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.000
It's that crazy guy Finn,

10:21.083 --> 10:23.959
the guy who tried to kill
Old Lady Halperin's dog.

10:24.041 --> 10:27.166
The only thing crazy is
you referring to Mrs. Halperin

10:27.250 --> 10:29.792
as "Old Lady Halperin."

10:29.875 --> 10:32.041
What are you,
in a Grimms' fable?

10:32.125 --> 10:33.959
-Hi!
-Hey!
-Hi!

10:34.041 --> 10:35.000
We have

10:35.083 --> 10:37.917
-a big announcement!
-(whoops)

10:38.000 --> 10:39.667
You're having a baby?

10:39.750 --> 10:41.166
No! We're having a party.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.959
You know I don't like babies,
and the fact

10:43.041 --> 10:45.458
that I can't have them
fits perfectly into that plan.

10:45.542 --> 10:46.500
-Right.
-It's a little get-together

10:46.583 --> 10:47.917
tomorrow afternoon,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.959
and we want you to be there.

10:50.041 --> 10:53.166
Oh!
Uh, yeah, no, we can't make it,

10:53.250 --> 10:54.792
because we're, are, um...

10:54.875 --> 10:56.542
we're going to San Diego
for the weekend.

10:56.625 --> 10:57.625
Right, Jen?

10:57.709 --> 10:59.417
For, uh, your, uh, lawyer thing?

10:59.500 --> 11:01.208
Right. Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

11:01.291 --> 11:04.875
We are.
We are going to... Lawyer-Con.

11:04.959 --> 11:08.542
Which is like Comic-Con,
except everyone is normal

11:08.625 --> 11:11.667
on the outside
and monsters on the inside.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.792
-Hmm...
-(sputters) We should just
cancel our party and go to that.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.291
God, we could Airbnb it.
Just take

11:15.375 --> 11:18.625
-the <i>Surfliner </i>down. Yes!
-Oh! We could all go together!

11:18.709 --> 11:20.959
-Just kidding!
It sounds genuinely horrible!
-Ugh!

11:21.041 --> 11:22.917
-We would never do that!
-(chuckling)

11:23.000 --> 11:24.709
-God, we're gonna miss you guys
at the party though,
-Yes.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.458
because when we get there,
it's like, oh...

11:26.542 --> 11:28.500
-(grunting)
And we're doing the...
-And one of these.

11:28.583 --> 11:29.750
-(whirring sounds)
-Yeah, okay, bye!

11:29.834 --> 11:32.000
Greg, what are you doing?

11:32.083 --> 11:34.375
-He was in the middle
of talking.
-Oh. Was he?

11:34.458 --> 11:35.667
Yes. And when someone's
in the middle

11:35.750 --> 11:36.750
of talking, you don't just...

11:36.834 --> 11:39.500
Better go lock the back door.

11:39.583 --> 11:42.000
(music playing faintly)

11:42.083 --> 11:43.333
♪ <i>Hey, hey, hey, hey... </i>♪

11:43.417 --> 11:46.166
What? Finn and Dianna
got an outdoor bar

11:46.250 --> 11:47.583
and a taco truck?

11:47.667 --> 11:49.166
(clicks tongue) Greg!

11:49.250 --> 11:50.750
I want to go!

11:50.834 --> 11:52.166
No, no, Jen,
get down from there!

11:52.250 --> 11:53.625
If they see us,
they're gonna know

11:53.709 --> 11:55.083
that we lied to them!

11:55.166 --> 11:57.417
Ugh. Fine.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.709
So we're trapped.

11:58.792 --> 12:00.083
Yeah. But it'll be all right,

12:00.166 --> 12:01.667
as long as we don't make
too much noise.

12:01.750 --> 12:02.750
-(knocking)
-JOAN: Greg? Jen?

12:02.834 --> 12:05.000
It's Mom!

12:05.083 --> 12:07.667
Jen? Is Greg okay?

12:07.750 --> 12:10.166
(whispers):
It's your parents.
We can't let them in.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.542
Well, maybe they're
in the bedroom making love.

12:12.625 --> 12:15.417
(chuckles) Wishful thinking,
Joanie.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.458
Hey!

12:16.542 --> 12:17.542
Old!

12:17.625 --> 12:18.750
And Older!

12:18.834 --> 12:19.875
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step away

12:19.959 --> 12:21.333
from my friends' door.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.000
Oh, we're visiting our son.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.583
Well, I think if he was
your son,

12:24.667 --> 12:26.542
then you'd know
that he's not in town.

12:26.625 --> 12:29.250
No... I'm telling you,
we're visiting our son.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.291
Get away
from my neighbors' house!

12:31.375 --> 12:32.917
-We're here! We're here.
-Oh!

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
We're here. We're home.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.875
I thought you guys were
in San Diego.

12:36.959 --> 12:40.125
Oh, yeah, you know what, uh,
Lawyer-Con was-was canceled.

12:40.208 --> 12:42.542
-Yeah.
-Yeah. A lawyer slipped
and fell,

12:42.625 --> 12:44.709
and then everyone
started suing everybody.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.500
-It was a whole situation.
-Mm.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.083
-So you know these people?
-GREG: Yes!

12:48.166 --> 12:50.583
-Yes, I know them.
They are my parents.
-Yes. Yeah.

12:50.667 --> 12:51.792
-Ah! Oh!
-Oh!

12:51.875 --> 12:53.583
Guys, what are you doing here?

12:53.667 --> 12:55.375
Your father wanted to talk
to Lark.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.792
He doesn't like the way
she says his name.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.000
Hi, Poop-Poop!

13:01.083 --> 13:03.375
She's doing that on purpose.

13:03.458 --> 13:05.834
How would you like it
if I called you Clark?

13:05.917 --> 13:08.083
You did,
for the first year of her life.

13:08.166 --> 13:11.041
Poop-Poop has feelings,
you know.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.458
FINN:
I'm so glad you came home.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.291
I wanted to apologize.

13:14.375 --> 13:17.291
I am so sorry that I locked you
in the trunk of my car.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.375
Well, I-I wasn't in your trunk.

13:19.458 --> 13:20.709
I was with you when you yelled

13:20.792 --> 13:22.166
at the old lady
with the barking dog.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.709
-Right. Dog guy.
-(chuckles)

13:23.792 --> 13:25.125
-You're not trunk guy.
-Yeah. You look like...

13:25.208 --> 13:27.250
I am so sorry about that.

13:27.333 --> 13:28.834
Okay? I was dealing with a lot

13:28.917 --> 13:31.125
-of social anxiety.
And I took some drugs that...
-Yeah.

13:31.208 --> 13:33.166
-put an edge on me.
-Mm-hmm.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.333
DIANNA:
But he went to rehab.

13:34.417 --> 13:35.375
-He made a new friend.
-Mm-hmm.

13:35.458 --> 13:36.417
They got really close.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.458
But I'm told
it didn't go further

13:37.542 --> 13:38.750
than friendship, so...

13:38.834 --> 13:40.583
Well, that's good.
For both of you.

13:40.667 --> 13:41.792
-Yeah, it's a crazy nine days,
you know?
-Yeah.

13:41.875 --> 13:42.834
(Dianna sighs)

13:42.917 --> 13:43.875
So, clean start?

13:43.959 --> 13:45.542
Yeah. Sure, man.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.625
What a relief! Yes!

13:47.709 --> 13:49.542
Because at rehab, they say
I got to be spending more time

13:49.625 --> 13:52.000
around good, honest people
like you, Greg.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.291
And I don't think it's
an accident

13:53.375 --> 13:55.625
that Lawyer-Con got canceled
and this happened.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.208
You know, the...
the thing is, uh...

13:58.291 --> 14:01.959
The truth, Finn, is that, uh,
Lawyer-Con wasn't cancelled

14:02.041 --> 14:04.542
because there's no such
thing as-as Lawyer-Con.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.125
-It doesn't exist. We...
-Yup.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.166
We just made it up

14:07.250 --> 14:08.792
because we felt weird

14:08.875 --> 14:11.041
-about going to your party,
so... sorry.
-Yeah.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.500
You lied to me?

14:12.583 --> 14:13.792
Uh...

14:13.875 --> 14:15.583
I mean, I got angry
and yelled at an old lady

14:15.667 --> 14:17.583
'cause I smoked a little crack.
I didn't lie to you.

14:17.667 --> 14:18.834
Sorry. What?
You smoked what, now?

14:18.917 --> 14:20.917
-I smoked some crack.
-Okay.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.834
-And that can explain
my behavior.
-Uh-huh.

14:22.917 --> 14:24.542
Greg, are you smoking crack
right now?

14:24.625 --> 14:26.583
Uh, uh, uh, uh, no,

14:26.667 --> 14:29.250
-but I-I do take
an allergy medication.
-Mm-hmm.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.166
(whooping)

14:31.250 --> 14:33.041
Oh, I'm burning up right now.
I don't know how to calm down.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.041
-Okay.
-Yeah, okay, let's go. Yeah.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.166
-(exhales deeply)
-Pretend they're not here.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.125
Congrats on your sobriety.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.291
Are you really sure

14:44.375 --> 14:47.667
that a holistic fertility
consultant is necessary?

14:47.750 --> 14:49.500
Well, I thought we said
we were gonna commit

14:49.583 --> 14:51.208
to doing whatever it takes
to get pregnant.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.709
Yeah! I just... I thought
that meant having a lot of sex.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.917
Well, me, too,
but we need more help,

14:56.000 --> 14:57.917
and we are running out
of affordable options.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.500
IVF can take up to $20,000.

15:00.583 --> 15:02.250
Do you have that?

15:02.333 --> 15:04.750
I mean, yesterday, you tipped
the barista with a button.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.500
(knocking at door)

15:06.583 --> 15:08.250
Okay, there he is.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.166
Let's just keep an open mind
and see what he has to say.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.458
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:11.542 --> 15:13.625
Hi!

15:13.709 --> 15:17.583
-Hey. You must be Matt,
and you, Colleen.
-Mm-hmm.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.583
Come in, come in, come in.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.792
Now, in order
to get Matt's seedlings

15:21.875 --> 15:23.834
to grow into a mighty oak,
it's important

15:23.917 --> 15:26.208
you get yourself
into a position for success.

15:26.291 --> 15:29.750
Have you been coming in
through the back door?

15:29.834 --> 15:31.875
-Excuse me? What?
-I know it's weird,

15:31.959 --> 15:33.792
but I truly believe
in the powers of feng shui.

15:33.875 --> 15:35.417
-(whispering): Feng shui.
-Shv-Shwing...

15:35.500 --> 15:37.542
-It's feng shui. Feng shui.
-Feng shui.

15:37.625 --> 15:38.917
-Yes, that's the one.
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.375
So if you're not entering
your house

15:40.458 --> 15:42.208
through the front door,
you should.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.625
Where did you find this guy?

15:43.709 --> 15:45.208
Jen said that he was "the best."

15:45.291 --> 15:47.583
But she's very sarcastic.
I can never tell with her.

15:47.667 --> 15:51.709
What you eat is essential
for your fertility.

15:51.792 --> 15:53.625
Might be looking
after your bodies more than

15:53.709 --> 15:55.083
you're looking
after this fridge.

15:55.166 --> 15:56.917
Is this how
you treat your swimmers?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.792
Oh! That's not a specimen.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.792
No, no, no. No, that's coleslaw.

16:00.875 --> 16:02.709
I... Uh, look, uh,
it could be confusing

16:02.792 --> 16:04.834
because it's in a specimen
cup, but it-it's coleslaw.

16:04.917 --> 16:06.333
You seem nervous.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.000
Part of your charm, I suppose?

16:08.083 --> 16:09.625
Are you, uh, hydrating?

16:09.709 --> 16:11.250
-Mm-hmm.
-You keeping off the alcohol?

16:11.333 --> 16:12.709
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Off the caffeine?

16:12.792 --> 16:14.667
Can't you tell?
I'm, like, barely alive.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.667
(groans, chuckles,
clears throat)

16:16.750 --> 16:18.834
Matt, you're supposed
to tell me I look pretty.

16:18.917 --> 16:20.625
-You're so pretty.
-(laughs)

16:20.709 --> 16:23.458
That's embarrassing. Don't.
Not in front of a guest.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.917
While you drink
the fertility teas...

16:26.000 --> 16:28.375
-Yeah.
-(coughs)
-I will prepare the

16:28.458 --> 16:31.041
homemade conception chimes.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.667
Now, we need to get rid
of all the bad energy.

16:33.750 --> 16:37.041
You'll feel the energy. The aura
will pass through the chimes.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.208
And then how do we get
the bad energy out?

16:39.291 --> 16:41.375
I suck it out.
I need a very tight

16:41.458 --> 16:45.125
seal, actually, so our mouths
will really connect.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.792
Who wants to go first?

16:47.875 --> 16:50.125
Well, I would say "not me,"
but I know that that means

16:50.208 --> 16:51.583
that you're going
to kiss my wife.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.625
It's not a kiss. It's a suck.

16:53.709 --> 16:56.750
-Mm.
-So I guess... I'll suck
your wife?

16:56.834 --> 16:58.542
(giggling)

16:58.625 --> 17:00.208
-No. No.
-We were... (clears throat)

17:00.291 --> 17:04.917
We were saying that we will do
whatever it takes.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.166
-So...
-Yeah, no, I know, and I-I
really, really want this, but...

17:08.250 --> 17:10.208
Do you really want it?!

17:10.291 --> 17:11.917
You really want a baby
very badly?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
-Yeah, well, yeah.
-Very. Very badly.

17:13.083 --> 17:16.333
Well, then why do I have this?

17:16.417 --> 17:19.834
-A little tiny car?
-That is, yes.
It's the wrong pocket.

17:19.917 --> 17:22.875
This is for my son,
who I'm hoping to meet today.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.250
Why do I have this?!

17:26.333 --> 17:28.083
Pain relievers
from your medicine cabinet!

17:28.166 --> 17:31.125
Guys, you can't be on
medication of any kind!

17:31.208 --> 17:33.500
-Did you go through
our medicine cabinet?
-Yes! A little bit.

17:33.583 --> 17:36.625
Any other skeletons
in your medicine... closet?

17:36.709 --> 17:38.834
-No. Nope.
-Clean as a whistle. Mm-hmm.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.542
Wonderful!
Then you're both on your way

17:40.625 --> 17:42.458
to becoming great parents.

17:42.542 --> 17:46.333
-Yay.
-Speaking of which,
what do 22-year-old boys like?

17:46.417 --> 17:48.250
I'm just worried
the car won't be enough.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.792
-Oh, yeah, no, that's
not gonna be enough.
-It's not.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.333
Oh, who am I kidding?
I'm just gonna cancel again.

17:52.417 --> 17:53.500
Mm-hmm.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.917
Oh.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.291
Thank you so much for seeing me,
Joan.

17:59.375 --> 18:00.792
I lied to Matt.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.750
No. Dear, I have patients.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.792
In two hours,
I'll be completely free.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.208
Oh, good. I'll be done by then.

18:07.291 --> 18:08.875
So, we're trying
to get pregnant, and that means

18:08.959 --> 18:10.333
going off all of our meds.

18:10.417 --> 18:12.166
But I haven't gone off
my mood stabilizers,

18:12.250 --> 18:13.667
and Matt doesn't know that.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.000
Does your doctor know?

18:15.083 --> 18:17.417
Oh, no. No, I don't need
to go see a doctor.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.458
My mom sends me all
of my pills from Mexico.

18:19.542 --> 18:21.166
Have I ever told you
about my mom?

18:21.250 --> 18:23.166
-Oh...
-No. Um, dear, if you stay here,

18:23.250 --> 18:25.041
you're going to have
couple's therapy

18:25.125 --> 18:27.000
with a complete stranger.

18:27.083 --> 18:30.375
Oh, that's okay.
I love strangers.

18:30.458 --> 18:31.792
Okay, so here's the deal:
Colleen doesn't know

18:31.875 --> 18:34.250
that I've been taking
finasteride for hair loss.

18:34.333 --> 18:37.208
Now I really want to have
a kid, but I love my hair,

18:37.291 --> 18:40.125
-and I don't want to look
like some bald loser.
-Oh, none taken.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.375
Could finasteride really
be hurting

18:41.458 --> 18:42.750
our chances of getting pregnant?

18:42.834 --> 18:44.375
Honestly,
going off it might just be

18:44.458 --> 18:47.125
the kick in the balls
your balls need.

18:47.208 --> 18:49.000
All right,
I got to get into surgery.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.500
-All righty. Thanks, Tim.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:51.583 --> 18:53.000
I already scrubbed up.
Can't be too careful.

18:53.083 --> 18:54.959
-All right, see you, brother.
-All right.

18:55.041 --> 18:56.250
Hey, Gerald! All right.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.917
Colleen?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.208
I have something to tell you.

19:08.291 --> 19:12.375
-Okay.
-Um, I lied to you.
I'm so sorry.

19:12.458 --> 19:15.583
I have secretly been taking
hair loss medication.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.834
Okay. So is that why
when we go to the pharmacy,

19:17.917 --> 19:19.917
-you tell me to wait in the car?
-Oh, no.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.959
That's because you like to try
to play with all the canes.

19:22.041 --> 19:23.917
No, no, no, no.
I get the pills in the mail.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.500
Oh. Okay, well, then Matt,

19:25.583 --> 19:27.667
I have something
that I need to tell you.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.875
-Okay.
-I have been on mood stabilizers

19:29.959 --> 19:31.667
since we started dating.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.458
So you're saying that
I'm the reason you take them?

19:33.542 --> 19:34.917
Oh, no! No, no, no,
lots of different reasons.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.291
But the main one is just because

19:36.375 --> 19:37.709
when I'm not on them,

19:37.792 --> 19:39.542
I am one moody bitch.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.291
-Honey, I am so okay with that.
-(knives scraping)

19:41.375 --> 19:43.500
-Okay.
-I mean, how moody
could we even be talking?

19:43.583 --> 19:45.875
-Why does that even matter?
-It doesn't. It doesn't even
matter a little bit.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.208
I'm just really worried that

19:47.291 --> 19:48.500
you're not gonna love me
off my meds.

19:48.583 --> 19:49.917
Oh, Colleen,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.375
I will always love you,
no matter what.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.792
(gasps)

19:52.875 --> 19:55.041
You are so good to me. Oh.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.542
(Colleen laughs)

19:57.625 --> 19:59.917
-Mmm.
-Is that another woman
I smell on you?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.917
-No, honey,
you're smelling yourself.
-You're so smart.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
-(laughs)
-I can't believe you lied to me.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.583
-So sorry.
-But I love you so much, and
I want you to be the father

20:06.667 --> 20:08.083
of my baby. Great. So...

20:08.166 --> 20:09.834
how long have you been
off the meds?

20:09.917 --> 20:12.875
Oh.
I'm going off of 'em tonight.

20:34.583 --> 20:36.166
