19:57.460 --> 19:59.264
SIMONS: I don't believe
you passed the test.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.435
TAYO: You can call me slow.
Just don't call me a liar.

20:01.435 --> 20:03.673
Hell, I'm calling you a liar
because you're slow.

20:03.673 --> 20:06.445
Hey, my time was
a little behind, too,

20:06.445 --> 20:07.782
if you want to train together.

20:07.782 --> 20:09.652
Yeah, I appreciate the offer.

20:09.652 --> 20:11.589
SIMONS: You can't make up
two minutes, not in five days.

20:11.589 --> 20:12.792
It can't be done.

20:12.792 --> 20:14.562
Hey, what is it with you, man?

20:14.562 --> 20:15.998
- I know running.
- And I know you.

20:15.998 --> 20:17.735
- You know me?
- Yeah, people like you.

20:17.735 --> 20:19.605
My whole life.
You're in every class,

20:19.605 --> 20:21.943
every work place, every
locker room. Yeah, I know you.

20:21.943 --> 20:23.747
Mm. Well, I'm not a bully.

20:23.747 --> 20:25.016
You're not a victim.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.487
You got found out, that's all.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.558
That's what this place is for.

20:33.031 --> 20:35.537
Look, Simons is an asshole.

20:36.606 --> 20:37.808
But he's right.

20:37.808 --> 20:39.410
About what?

20:40.881 --> 20:43.251
(whispers): Tayo is never
gonna make that time.

20:44.788 --> 20:48.295
Well, we don't know that.
We have to at least try.

20:49.497 --> 20:51.870
You have to try, you mean?

20:51.870 --> 20:53.740
Why do you say it like that?

20:53.740 --> 20:56.646
Because there isn't a lost
cause you don't get in line for.

20:56.646 --> 20:57.882
Where is this coming from?

20:57.882 --> 20:59.652
HOUR:
You want to loan me money.

20:59.652 --> 21:01.321
Help Tayo train.

21:02.658 --> 21:03.894
That's your thing, right?

21:03.894 --> 21:05.496
My thing? No.

21:05.496 --> 21:06.666
I don't have a thing.

21:06.666 --> 21:07.668
Everyone has a thing.

21:07.668 --> 21:09.639
Yours is saving people.

21:09.639 --> 21:11.876
So, what, should I have
just not said anything?

21:11.876 --> 21:13.780
I mean, Tayo can
handle himself.

21:13.780 --> 21:15.784
Should I have just
let you leave?

21:15.784 --> 21:17.755
Maybe you should have.

21:17.755 --> 21:20.059
So leave.
That can be your thing.

21:20.059 --> 21:22.531
Leaving. I won't try
and stop you this time.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.802
You would try to stop me.

21:24.802 --> 21:26.872
No, I wouldn't.

21:36.859 --> 21:39.097
Did we just have
our first fight?

21:39.097 --> 21:41.635
Yeah, I think we did.

21:42.571 --> 21:45.577
Any chance it'll be our last?

21:46.913 --> 21:48.783
No.

22:05.617 --> 22:08.690
LENNIX: It was
the Bureau's darkest hour.

22:08.690 --> 22:11.128
And our deadliest day.

22:11.128 --> 22:14.669
44 agents died in that attack.

22:14.669 --> 22:18.108
We vowed that nothing like it
would ever happen again.

22:18.108 --> 22:21.047
No matter what the cost.

22:24.955 --> 22:26.960
<i>POET:
I heard about your divorce.</i>

22:26.960 --> 22:29.732
I'm really sorry.

22:29.732 --> 22:32.003
Yeah, it's, uh...

22:32.003 --> 22:34.808
it was in the
cards for a while.

22:36.846 --> 22:39.851
We both held on
for the girls, but, um...

22:41.922 --> 22:43.960
...holding on wasn't enough.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.705
Murphy told me
you're getting into politics.

22:50.306 --> 22:52.878
We all become our parents
in the end.

22:52.878 --> 22:54.982
(both laugh)

22:54.982 --> 22:57.687
- They must be thrilled.
- They are.

22:59.057 --> 23:01.596
After I retired, the...

23:01.596 --> 23:04.066
Bureau suggested
that I teach at Quantico.

23:06.004 --> 23:08.008
I tried for a time.

23:09.177 --> 23:11.414
Uh, the training has changed.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.655
You know,
five months to five weeks.

23:14.655 --> 23:16.959
Core components only--
how to shoot, how to fight.

23:17.694 --> 23:20.199
(stammers) They don't even
need to know how to drive anymore.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.203
They say
it's to get the trainees out

23:22.203 --> 23:25.176
into the field faster and help
with the recruitment issues.

23:25.176 --> 23:27.948
I mean, who'd want
to be an agent now?

23:29.217 --> 23:31.188
They're just told where to go.

23:31.188 --> 23:33.626
What to do.

23:35.062 --> 23:37.433
It's gone, Poet.

23:38.936 --> 23:40.873
The Bureau that we knew.

23:42.978 --> 23:44.214
It broke my heart

23:44.214 --> 23:47.053
to see what Quantico's
been turned into.

23:47.053 --> 23:50.025
Our class would never make it
through there today.

23:52.998 --> 23:56.037
I gave the Bureau
my entire life.

23:57.841 --> 24:00.046
(sighs)

24:00.046 --> 24:02.918
Now they're watching me.

24:02.918 --> 24:05.824
- They watch everyone.
- No, not like that.

24:05.824 --> 24:08.963
This is an operation.

24:08.963 --> 24:12.070
I mean, they have agents
outside my apartment.

24:12.070 --> 24:15.109
When Garcia showed up,
they were right there, waiting.

24:15.109 --> 24:18.850
What the hell did you and
Murphy find in Garcia's house?

24:18.850 --> 24:22.123
Before we could investigate
his computer,

24:22.123 --> 24:24.795
other agents came in
and stopped us.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.801
Amos gave me something.

24:27.801 --> 24:29.805
Some kind of keycard.

24:34.013 --> 24:35.984
You should talk to Hour.

24:35.984 --> 24:38.789
She's the only one who
ever understood the code.

24:41.896 --> 24:44.935
Okay, how long has it been
since you two talked?

24:48.876 --> 24:50.980
Nine years.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.010
(alarm clock sounding)

25:07.881 --> 25:09.117
Mm.

25:09.117 --> 25:11.121
(alarm stops)

25:11.121 --> 25:13.191
(birds singing outside)

25:28.321 --> 25:30.726
♪

25:43.786 --> 25:45.088
Hey.

25:46.926 --> 25:49.164
And there she is.

25:49.164 --> 25:52.170
So, I was thinking
we could start...

25:52.170 --> 25:55.108
You don't think
I'm gonna make it, do you?

25:56.812 --> 25:59.050
Well, there's a chance.

25:59.050 --> 26:00.753
Okay.

26:02.356 --> 26:05.228
You know, I see you standing
there worrying about me.

26:06.364 --> 26:09.972
What you don't see
is me standing here...

26:09.972 --> 26:12.109
worrying about you.

26:14.347 --> 26:16.752
Ready?

26:19.323 --> 26:21.294
<i>GABRIEL:
All right, listen up!</i>

26:21.294 --> 26:26.304
Tyler Simons challenges
for the 300 meter sprint record.

26:26.304 --> 26:28.041
DREW:
The trainee record

26:28.041 --> 26:31.214
has remained unbroken
for 20 years.

26:31.214 --> 26:34.822
32.45 seconds.

26:34.822 --> 26:37.360
GABRIEL:
It's held
by Special Agent Mitch Colby.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.366
We called him,
and he has a message for Simons.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.203
"It's about time!"

26:42.203 --> 26:43.806
- All right.
- MAN: Yeah.

26:43.806 --> 26:44.909
(trainees whooping)

26:44.909 --> 26:46.178
Let's go.

26:46.178 --> 26:48.248
(indistinct
shouting, whooping)

26:49.017 --> 26:51.354
DREW:
Let's go up to the track!

26:51.354 --> 26:53.792
(whooping, shouting, clapping)

26:55.863 --> 26:57.033
(whistle blows)

26:57.033 --> 26:59.972
- Let's go!
- (shouting, cheering)

26:59.972 --> 27:03.111

27:04.949 --> 27:07.019

shouting continue)

27:09.490 --> 27:12.129
- (beeps)
<i>- DREW: 18/100 of a second off.</i>

27:12.129 --> 27:13.465
A great achievement.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.369
The second fastest trainee.

27:15.369 --> 27:16.805
(Gabriel whoops)

27:20.880 --> 27:22.951
Great job. Great.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.328
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

27:29.297 --> 27:32.136
- You good, man?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:32.136 --> 27:35.009
(chuckles)
So I'm fastest white trainee

27:35.009 --> 27:37.013
in the history
of Quantico, right?

27:37.013 --> 27:40.019
You know? Yeah.

27:40.019 --> 27:42.991
There aren't separate
records. -SIMONS: What'd you
say?

27:42.991 --> 27:46.965
I said, there aren't...
separate... records.

27:50.038 --> 27:51.675
Don't do that.

27:53.044 --> 27:54.848
Do what?

27:55.550 --> 27:58.422
- Make this into something.
- What am I making it into?

27:58.422 --> 28:01.094
You said a thing,
and I'm just curious about it.

28:01.094 --> 28:03.967
- Hey, what's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

28:03.967 --> 28:06.171
You don't get to decide
that it's nothing, okay?

28:06.171 --> 28:08.308
It's pretty obvious.

28:08.308 --> 28:10.914
- TAYO: What is?
- SIMONS: Um,

28:10.914 --> 28:12.985
you're just annoyed that
you're about to get kicked out.

28:12.985 --> 28:14.989
I'm standing here as a
trainee, just like you.

28:14.989 --> 28:16.926
- Sure, until Friday.
- Oh, okay.

28:16.926 --> 28:19.029
You just got revealed.
That's all.

28:20.365 --> 28:23.272
I mean, that is
what this place is for, right?

28:23.272 --> 28:25.910
(Simons laughs softly)

28:25.910 --> 28:27.246
Say it.

28:27.246 --> 28:28.983
Say what?

28:28.983 --> 28:31.321
I can tell that
you want to say it, so say it.

28:31.321 --> 28:33.926
I want you to.

28:33.926 --> 28:35.997
All right, that's enough.
Everybody out!

28:35.997 --> 28:38.001
Our class, stay!

28:40.105 --> 28:42.442
Tayo, Simons, in front.

28:46.518 --> 28:49.090
I don't care whether
you like each other or not.

28:49.090 --> 28:50.492
These are the people
who'll be by your side

28:50.492 --> 28:52.229
when you're under fire.

28:52.229 --> 28:54.500
I won't pass a class
that behaves like this.

28:54.500 --> 28:58.308
I don't care if the Bureau
has already spent $100,000

28:58.308 --> 29:00.547
on each of you.

29:00.547 --> 29:03.051
You will all move forward
on Friday,

29:03.051 --> 29:05.089
or none of you will.

29:05.089 --> 29:07.192
(quiet, indistinct murmurs)

29:09.397 --> 29:10.933
(exhales)

29:16.277 --> 29:18.448
(knocking at door)

29:31.374 --> 29:33.245
- Hi.
- Yup.

29:33.245 --> 29:35.082
Yeah, I knew
it was gonna be you.

29:35.082 --> 29:37.086
Or Gabriel coming here
to tell me about how,

29:37.086 --> 29:39.490
when they joined the FBI, that
some trainee gave him a wedgie

29:39.490 --> 29:41.194
for being born
in the Philippines,

29:41.194 --> 29:43.198
and that I should look
the other way.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.135
What's the point of looking
the other way, though, Poet,

29:45.135 --> 29:47.541
when all you see is
the same goddamn thing?

29:47.541 --> 29:49.476
Can I come in?

29:52.584 --> 29:55.990
(scoffs)
Poet, you ever been arrested?

29:57.059 --> 29:59.430
- No.
- Okay.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.167
Uh, ask me
if I ever been arrested.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.637
Go on. Don't be embarrassed.
Ask me.

30:02.637 --> 30:06.010
- No, Tayo, I'm not going
to ask you that.
- Once.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.413
I was 15 years old.

30:07.413 --> 30:09.083
Driving to the movies.

30:09.083 --> 30:11.020
I think it was <i>Crimson Tide.</i>

30:11.020 --> 30:13.158
- Yeah, <i>Crimson Tide.</i>
You seen it?
- Submarines.

30:13.158 --> 30:15.429
Yeah, my oldest brothers, um,
they were in the front seat,

30:15.429 --> 30:17.433
and I was in the back,
reading a book I checked out

30:17.433 --> 30:20.573
from the library about nuclear
submarines, I kid you not.

30:20.573 --> 30:22.309
'Cause I wanted to make sure
the movie was accurate.

30:22.309 --> 30:24.313
And then, you know,

30:24.313 --> 30:27.587
we see those police lights
flashing right behind us.

30:27.587 --> 30:32.163
And my oldest brother, he just
pulls over, nice and slow,

30:32.163 --> 30:34.434
shows his ID, nice and slow,

30:34.434 --> 30:36.171
does everything right,
like we've been taught.

30:36.171 --> 30:37.574
"Yes, sir." "No, Officer."

30:37.574 --> 30:39.578
"We was just going
to the movies, sir."

30:39.578 --> 30:43.185
But, uh... that
was not enough.

30:43.185 --> 30:46.357
No, the officer-- he wants us
to get out of the vehicle.

30:48.361 --> 30:50.567
And so we comply, but

30:50.567 --> 30:53.438
they start arguing,
like hotshot lawyers,

30:53.438 --> 30:55.543
just arguing about
their rights.

30:56.512 --> 30:58.348
And to shut them up,

30:58.348 --> 31:02.089
the other officer comes
over to me...

31:02.089 --> 31:05.229
and he looks at me,

31:05.229 --> 31:07.366
the silent one,

31:07.366 --> 31:09.303
quiet one...

31:10.640 --> 31:14.080
...the baby of the group,

31:14.080 --> 31:16.585
and he just...

31:16.585 --> 31:19.156
just...

31:23.398 --> 31:25.435
...slaps me
right across my face.

31:29.410 --> 31:31.581
The look on their faces.

31:33.151 --> 31:35.288
And it worked.

31:36.390 --> 31:38.495
It worked, because...

31:38.495 --> 31:41.167
they didn't say a word.

31:43.137 --> 31:45.108
My father never hit me,
God rest his soul.

31:45.108 --> 31:48.181
My mother,
she never hit me, either.

31:48.181 --> 31:50.252
But that officer-- he was

31:50.252 --> 31:52.724
the first person in my life

31:52.724 --> 31:56.631
to ever... hit me.

32:00.305 --> 32:03.144
POET:
I'm sorry.

32:03.144 --> 32:05.148
What are you sorry for?

32:05.148 --> 32:08.288
I'm not sorry.

32:08.288 --> 32:10.292
No, no, no, I'm not sorry.

32:10.292 --> 32:12.296
It helped me...

32:12.296 --> 32:15.235
understand
how to see this world.

32:20.412 --> 32:23.285
How you see the world?

32:23.285 --> 32:26.525
That's what worries me.

32:36.612 --> 32:38.649
(soft, rhythmic beeping)

32:49.169 --> 32:51.307
Senator.

32:51.307 --> 32:52.711
What is it you want to say?

32:52.711 --> 32:55.215
There are
inexplicable arrests.

32:55.215 --> 32:57.486
- You know it, I know it.
- No, Senator, I don't know it.

32:57.486 --> 32:59.357
People who've done
nothing wrong.

32:59.357 --> 33:01.261
So they say.

33:01.261 --> 33:03.298
I have a close friend.

33:03.298 --> 33:05.703
Her son was arrested by the
Bureau, and none of us know why.

33:05.703 --> 33:07.339
Well, maybe
she didn't know her son

33:07.339 --> 33:08.676
as well as she
thought she did.

33:08.676 --> 33:10.680
It wasn't
for something they'd done.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.686
It could only have been
for something they might do.

33:13.686 --> 33:16.791
Tell me that's impossible,
and I walk out.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.338
You know, according
to folklore,

33:23.338 --> 33:26.411
500 years ago
in the city of Prague,

33:26.411 --> 33:28.749
Rabbi Loew made a creature
out of clay,

33:28.749 --> 33:33.759
a golem, scraped from the
banks of the River Vltava,

33:33.759 --> 33:37.499
to protect the Jews
from persecution.

33:37.499 --> 33:39.504
You see, he didn't really
trust his rulers.

33:39.504 --> 33:41.642
(chuckling softly):
He certainly didn't
trust the law.

33:41.642 --> 33:45.382
People can't save the Jews.

33:45.382 --> 33:48.756
But with this clay golem,

33:48.756 --> 33:50.793
brought to life

33:50.793 --> 33:53.799
with the breath of God's name,

33:53.799 --> 33:56.605
they might stand a chance.

33:59.544 --> 34:01.214
(Tayo exhales)

34:01.214 --> 34:03.686
Not everyone sees this system
as a savior.

34:03.686 --> 34:06.691
People failed, Senator.

34:09.564 --> 34:13.405
In their most basic,
their most basic duty

34:13.405 --> 34:16.411
to protect each other,
to look after one another.

34:16.411 --> 34:18.548
People...

34:19.851 --> 34:22.322
...well, they're just
no goddamn good at it.

34:34.380 --> 34:37.218
What about Amos Garcia?

34:41.460 --> 34:43.497
(panting)

34:48.609 --> 34:50.345
Hey.

34:51.414 --> 34:53.451
I'm sorry.

34:54.754 --> 34:57.526
You saying you're sorry,
or you saying "goodbye"?

34:58.629 --> 35:00.532
GABRIEL:
All right, let's go!

35:05.308 --> 35:07.345
(Tayo panting)

35:08.916 --> 35:11.722
GABRIEL:
Three, two, one.

35:11.722 --> 35:13.759
(whistle blows)

35:37.406 --> 35:39.443
(Tayo panting loudly)

35:41.915 --> 35:43.351
(stopwatch clicks)

35:43.952 --> 35:45.656
(yells)

35:45.656 --> 35:48.394
(Tayo pants, groans)

35:50.800 --> 35:52.369
GABRIEL:
Tayo?

35:52.369 --> 35:54.439
(panting)

35:58.549 --> 36:01.487
With a time
of 13 minutes and two seconds,

36:01.487 --> 36:03.558
you failed the fitness test.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.835
Is there anything
you want to say?

36:10.639 --> 36:13.879
Sir, I've been reading
about procedures at Quantico,

36:13.879 --> 36:16.919
and according to the rules,
it says that it's possible

36:16.919 --> 36:20.392
for me to retake the fitness
test in seven weeks now.

36:20.392 --> 36:22.797
If that is possible, sir,

36:22.797 --> 36:26.505
I would like
to retake that test.

36:26.505 --> 36:28.609
And I promise you...

36:28.609 --> 36:31.414
I promise you I'll pass.

36:31.414 --> 36:33.718
(Tayo panting)

36:35.488 --> 36:37.425
(groans softly)

36:38.027 --> 36:40.431
(speaking indistinctly)

36:49.884 --> 36:52.523
What do you want to do?

36:53.525 --> 36:55.428
Okay.

36:56.832 --> 36:58.869
(Tayo groans)

37:04.681 --> 37:05.916
Okay.

37:15.636 --> 37:17.940
(panting loudly)

37:24.954 --> 37:26.925
<i>TAYO:
It's going great.</i>

37:26.925 --> 37:29.598
<i>(chuckling):
It really is. I promise you.</i>

37:29.598 --> 37:32.904
<i>No, Ma.
It's different this time.</i>

37:32.904 --> 37:35.909
It's not like school, no.

37:38.014 --> 37:40.786
Yeah, no, it's not
like school at all.

37:41.788 --> 37:43.759
(laughs)

37:43.759 --> 37:46.598
Well, you don't have
to worry about me.

37:46.598 --> 37:49.571
Okay. I love you, too.

37:49.571 --> 37:51.774
Bye, Ma.

37:58.822 --> 38:00.859
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

38:05.970 --> 38:08.007
(footsteps approaching)

38:10.813 --> 38:12.616
Come here.

38:17.058 --> 38:18.895
How is she?

38:20.866 --> 38:22.736
Yeah.

38:24.072 --> 38:26.076
(sighs heavily)

38:27.078 --> 38:30.485
Hey, it's not your fault.

38:30.485 --> 38:31.955
Okay?

38:40.806 --> 38:42.843
(rhythmic beeping)

39:12.168 --> 39:15.642
Was it worth it?

39:19.049 --> 39:22.022
They...

39:22.022 --> 39:24.092
revealed themselves.

39:31.140 --> 39:33.612
Did we stop something?

39:34.614 --> 39:36.618
Or start it?

39:42.897 --> 39:44.768
<i>What are they planning
to attack?</i>

39:44.768 --> 39:46.772
(guns cocking)

39:46.772 --> 39:48.140
<i>TAYO:
Us.</i>
