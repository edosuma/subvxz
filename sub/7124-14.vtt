10:05.404 --> 10:06.996
bad people?

10:07.073 --> 10:09.439
Uh... probably not.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.169
I don't think there
are bad people.

10:11.243 --> 10:12.574
Hmm.

10:12.645 --> 10:16.172
I think good people do bad stuff
sometimes, and... oh... and

10:16.248 --> 10:18.045
<i>that's</i> bad.

10:18.117 --> 10:21.484
But if you only do it once,
it's just a mistake, and...

10:21.554 --> 10:23.044
that's not bad.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.180
I think.

10:24.256 --> 10:25.814
[Laughs]
Word.

10:25.891 --> 10:29.452
But... I mean [sighs] I do think
it was wrong to steal this CD.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.826
Yeah, I feel kind
of bad about that.

10:31.897 --> 10:33.159
[CD player whirs]

10:33.232 --> 10:34.631
We should probably
mail it back to her.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.065
Yeah! Good call.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.534
L... oh, my glob!

10:37.603 --> 10:39.628
Aaah!

10:39.705 --> 10:40.694
Aaah!

10:42.274 --> 10:44.139
Aah-aah!

10:48.481 --> 10:50.506
BOTH:
Pow!

10:50.583 --> 10:52.107
Couldn't get up
from the bed.

10:52.184 --> 10:56.143
I was lazy, and that's why I
can't have frosting anymore.

10:56.222 --> 10:59.089
Okay, so does everybody
have what they want?

10:59.158 --> 11:01.285
[Cheers and applause]

11:01.360 --> 11:03.351
Wait, I think I'm
ready to pop it.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.659
[Grunting]

11:05.731 --> 11:07.392
Ha!

11:07.466 --> 11:10.230
[Cheers and applause]

11:10.302 --> 11:12.497
