00:03.264 --> 00:05.440
[Martin] You ever wonder
if Abby was right?

00:05.570 --> 00:07.659
What if it's all just a dream?

00:07.790 --> 00:08.965
Who did you come here with?

00:09.096 --> 00:12.925
My mother.
She was nice.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.188
What are you drawing?

00:14.318 --> 00:15.667
Things I've seen.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.147
It's good to draw them
when you see them

00:17.278 --> 00:21.325
so even if you forget,
pictures remember.

00:21.456 --> 00:24.720
When Christopher started seeing
that symbol, things changed.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.375
He changed. Everyone died.

00:27.505 --> 00:28.898
[Tabitha] I've seen this.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.378
[Jade] Yeah, like in
a vision or something?

00:30.508 --> 00:31.857
[Tabitha] No, on the walls
in the tunnels.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.685
What tunnels?

00:33.816 --> 00:35.426
[Jim] You heard
the voice on the radio.

00:35.557 --> 00:40.083
That means that there are
people out there who can see us.

00:40.214 --> 00:43.695
And what part of you thinks
that that's a good sign?

00:43.826 --> 00:46.524
You already got people's hopes
up with your goddamn tower--

00:46.655 --> 00:48.483
All the more reason that we--

00:48.613 --> 00:50.572
To keep our fucking
mouths shut.

00:51.660 --> 00:54.663
What if I told you
that drone might get you home

00:54.793 --> 00:56.534
in time for
your nephew's birthday?

00:56.665 --> 00:59.668
Experiments have been going on
like this for a long, long time.

00:59.798 --> 01:00.886
This radio's pretty trashed.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.062
Well, the radio's
not the problem.

01:02.192 --> 01:03.933
I can handle the radio.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.239
And it never occurred to you
that some of the people here

01:05.369 --> 01:06.675
might be in on it?

01:06.805 --> 01:08.807
How else do you keep
the experiment on track?

01:08.938 --> 01:10.200
[Kristi]
You really did it.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.723
You killed one of them.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.247
What do we do
with the body?

01:13.377 --> 01:15.031
[Kristi] This is our chance
to learn about them.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.989
We can open them up, see what
they look like on the inside.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.339
-Fuck!
-Just stop!

01:18.469 --> 01:19.427
-Fuckin' piece of shit!
-Okay, stop it!

01:19.557 --> 01:21.211
-Stop! Hey!
-Kristi, hey, hey! Stop!

01:21.342 --> 01:22.560
[Kenny] You really think
injecting them

01:22.691 --> 01:23.953
with that stuff's gonna
kill them?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.868
Honestly, I got
no fucking idea.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.870
It's the
best chance we got.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.698
How are we even
gonna test it?

01:29.828 --> 01:30.960
[Julie] I do have
this little trick, though,

01:31.090 --> 01:33.310
for when things really
start to get to me.

01:33.441 --> 01:36.096
I fill up the bathtub
and I sink down just enough

01:36.226 --> 01:38.098
so that the water
is level with my ears,

01:38.227 --> 01:40.535
and I just sit like that
for a while, and I breathe.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.367
Look, if someone out here
really wanted to help,

07:35.498 --> 07:37.500
they would find
a way to help.

I'm not saying accuse,
I just...

07:50.078 --> 07:52.646

who told you what was what?

07:52.776 --> 07:54.256

into the Colony House.

-See what?

No.

I wasn't there.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.975
Right.

And of all the people that
died since you've been here,

08:21.109 --> 08:23.024
how many times have you
actually seen it happen?

08:24.416 --> 08:26.330
What's your point?

08:26.462 --> 08:29.596
Well, what if the people
these "monsters" are killing,

08:29.726 --> 08:31.815

all in on it?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.295
I mean, you wanna scare
the shit out of people,

08:33.425 --> 08:34.992
you need
a body count, right?

08:35.123 --> 08:37.386
Maybe that's why they
say when you get here,

your blinds down.

I didn't see it happen.
Did you?

08:51.487 --> 08:53.184
I mean, yeah,
I saw a body the next day,

08:53.315 --> 08:56.927
but I didn't get close enough
to see if that shit was real.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.668
Have you seen one ounce of proof
that anyone here has actually--

08:58.799 --> 08:59.800
Nathan.

slit his throat.

09:08.504 --> 09:09.984
Or she didn't.

Let's just imagine for
a second that I'm right,

09:14.510 --> 09:16.556
and everyone here
that dies is in on it.

09:16.686 --> 09:17.861
It's gonna mean
one of two things.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.908
One, they pushed Sara
so far that

09:21.038 --> 09:23.737
she actually killed someone,
which, you know, maybe she did.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.522
Or, like everything else,
that whole thing with Nathan,

09:26.653 --> 09:30.178
him arriving just in time
to save your kid,

09:30.308 --> 09:31.527
what if that's
all just for show?

09:36.184 --> 09:38.490
Maybe poor little Sara's
not as broken as you think.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.369
[door opens]

09:50.502 --> 09:52.592
Hey, Sara.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.028

come by and check on you--

09:54.158 --> 09:54.985
I wanna go back out.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.683

09:56.813 --> 09:58.380
To the woods.
I wanna go back.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.861

take a talisman.

10:00.991 --> 10:01.949
What if you were right?

10:03.254 --> 10:04.429
What if the answers
are out there?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.606
Maybe we just didn't
go out far enough.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.738
Well, we went far enough
that whatever's out there

10:08.869 --> 10:10.305
put us right
the fuck back here.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.570
So that's it.
We just give up?

10:14.701 --> 10:15.702
I didn't say that.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.442
I get it.
People need you here.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.967
You shouldn't be out there,
but I can--

10:20.097 --> 10:21.185
Just let me do this.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.448
Okay. Why--

10:23.579 --> 10:24.624
Why do you wanna
go out there?

10:24.754 --> 10:25.929
Because I wanna help.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.931
I'm sure you do,

10:28.062 --> 10:30.238
but that's not why
you wanna leave. So...

10:32.022 --> 10:33.676
There's no place for me here.

10:33.807 --> 10:37.549
No one even wants me here, and
they're right, I shouldn't--

10:37.680 --> 10:40.291
This is something
I can do.

10:40.422 --> 10:43.947
There's a difference
between going out there

10:44.078 --> 10:45.470
and running away from here.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.864
Leaving? That'd feel good.
It'd be easy.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.345
We don't get to do
easy anymore.

10:53.217 --> 10:57.091
I can't just sit
in that church anymore.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.008
There's nothing for me to do.
Nowhere for me to go.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.271
Okay. Good.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.534
Now we're talking
about problems we can fix.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.106
Down there.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.455
That's where
I saw your symbol,

11:13.585 --> 11:16.153
and it's...

11:16.284 --> 11:18.852
also the first time
I saw the children.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.810
And those, uh, those things
that come out at night,

11:20.941 --> 11:22.290
they're down there, too?

11:22.420 --> 11:25.162
-Yeah.
-All right.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.512
This has to mean something.
It can't--

11:27.643 --> 11:29.123
It can't be a coincidence.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.951
Why?

11:31.081 --> 11:32.474
How much do you know
about chaos theory?

11:35.825 --> 11:39.133
A butterfly--a butterfly
flaps its wings in Wyoming.

11:40.830 --> 11:45.356
A month later there's
a tsunami in Japan,

11:45.487 --> 11:48.882
and on the surface the two
events appear entirely unrelated

11:49.012 --> 11:53.364
but in reality there is an
intricate set of connections--

11:53.495 --> 11:54.626
Jade, what the fuck
are you talking about?

11:54.757 --> 11:56.106
It's not an accident.
We just--

11:56.237 --> 11:58.326
We need more information
to see how they're connected.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.198
Well, I'm not gonna
go back in there.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.635
[laughing]
Yeah, no shit.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.246
I mean,
you'd have to be crazy--

12:07.291 --> 12:08.510
Motherfucker.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.033
What?

12:10.164 --> 12:11.861
Did Victor see it?

12:11.992 --> 12:13.994
You told me Victor
was down there with you.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.430
Did he see the symbol
on the walls?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.214
Of course. He was
the one that pointed it out.

12:17.345 --> 12:20.522
Of course. I asked him.
I asked him, point blank.

12:20.652 --> 12:21.566
He promised to tell me
everything he knew

12:21.697 --> 12:24.482
about that symbol,
yet somehow,

12:24.613 --> 12:26.180
he manages to leave out...

12:30.184 --> 12:31.881
You know, in the entire
Venn diagram of crazy that

12:32.012 --> 12:33.056
that you and I have seen,

12:33.187 --> 12:35.189
there's one single point
of overlap.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.329
[knocks]

12:50.682 --> 12:51.596
Hi.

12:51.727 --> 12:54.599
Uh, is Ethan home?

12:54.730 --> 12:57.385
Um, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Come on in.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.171
I'll--
I'll wait out here.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.520
Okay.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.829
Ethan!
Victor's here!

13:13.009 --> 13:15.925
You know,
I never got to thank you

13:16.056 --> 13:19.276
for everything that you did
that night at Colony House.

13:19.407 --> 13:21.713
I mean, getting me out of there.
You saved my life.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.237
-Okay.
-[footsteps on stairs]

13:23.367 --> 13:26.457
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:26.588 --> 13:27.937
'Kay.
I'll be ready in two minutes.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.330
Okay.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.984
We're going to help
Mrs. Liu at the diner.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.247
I brought you something.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.597
Are you gonna come in?

13:35.727 --> 13:37.512
No, you have
to come outside.

13:38.556 --> 13:39.993
Why?

13:40.123 --> 13:41.255
Because you have to
try it on.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.433
Come.

13:45.563 --> 13:48.523
It's getting cold
and you'll need a coat soon.

13:50.438 --> 13:51.569
This used to be mine.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.008
Can you see if it fits?

13:56.531 --> 13:57.706
Yeah.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.449
[murmurs]

14:03.755 --> 14:05.627
Here.
I drew this for you.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.545
Uh, I don't want this.

14:11.763 --> 14:12.852
-Why?
-Because,

14:12.982 --> 14:15.028
pictures are
for things that are gone.

14:15.158 --> 14:17.160
But what if
something happens to me?

14:17.291 --> 14:18.945
You forget
a lot of stuff.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.337
I wouldn't want
you to forget me.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.644
I said,
don't talk like that.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.910
Well, if you don't keep it,
I don't want the coat.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.654
'Kay, you ready?
We gotta go.

14:35.091 --> 14:35.962
Wanna come?

14:38.747 --> 14:40.140
Okay.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.141
Come on.

14:43.621 --> 14:44.840
Nice jacket.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.407
Thanks.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.540
[Boyd] Are you sure
you shouldn't be in bed?

14:49.671 --> 14:51.238
I mean, no, I'm fine.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.675
You know, I'm not gonna be
doing any push-ups anytime soon,

14:53.805 --> 14:57.157
but I feel great.
Seriously.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.376
Did Kristi
check you out?

14:59.507 --> 15:02.162
Yeah, yeah, and she's more
surprised than you.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.381
And what about Dale?

15:04.512 --> 15:05.861
Donna's locked him
up in his room.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.341
Dad, everything's fine.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.520
What are you smiling about?

15:12.650 --> 15:13.695
[chuckles]

15:15.653 --> 15:17.177
I have some news.

15:17.307 --> 15:19.570
Corey said you were
looking for me?

15:19.701 --> 15:23.009
Oh, yeah, I'll, uh...
Uh, one sec. Yeah.

15:25.532 --> 15:26.621
I'll tell you later.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.582
Okay. Get some rest.

15:31.713 --> 15:32.932
All right, Dad.
Look, Dad, I'm good,

15:33.062 --> 15:34.716
but go ahead.

15:37.327 --> 15:38.328
Hey.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.898
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

15:43.029 --> 15:44.465
I really don't
need this today, Boyd.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.380
I have a headache like
you would not believe.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.034
I'm not asking you
to let her stay here.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.600
Look, just throw me a bone.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.820
Give her something to do.
Anything. I don't care.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.083
She just wants
to feel useful.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.346
-Okay. I'll do what I can.
-Thank you.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.915
But we have bigger problems
right now than Sara being bored.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.657
I got a house full of people
on their last nerve,

16:02.787 --> 16:04.615
a madman locked
in the bedroom,

16:04.746 --> 16:07.575
and last night Elgin
almost drowned in his sleep.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.143
What? He what?

16:10.273 --> 16:12.101
[knocking]

16:12.232 --> 16:13.189
Come in.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.236
Hey.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.238
I heard about what
happened last night.

16:18.368 --> 16:19.804
What are you doing?

16:19.935 --> 16:21.371
I found these in
one of the closets.

16:22.590 --> 16:23.591
Helps me relax.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.766
Huh.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.597
Wanna tell me
about it?

16:29.727 --> 16:31.468
This nightmare of yours.

16:31.599 --> 16:32.600
I was, uh...

16:35.037 --> 16:36.430
I was sitting
in the bathtub,

16:36.560 --> 16:39.607
in my dream,

16:39.737 --> 16:42.392
and something
pushed me under the water.

16:44.264 --> 16:47.657
Then I guess
someone shook me awake,

16:47.789 --> 16:50.096
and I started
spitting up water and, uh...

16:50.226 --> 16:51.967
How's that even possible?

16:56.493 --> 16:58.668
You didn't tell anybody
about anything that happened

16:58.800 --> 16:59.931
at the clinic, did you?

17:00.061 --> 17:03.848
[exhales]

17:03.979 --> 17:05.676
Well, I got some good news.

17:05.807 --> 17:09.463
We, uh, pulled something
out of that thing...

17:10.681 --> 17:13.423
something
that might help us.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.513
So you think
it's like a poison?

17:16.644 --> 17:18.211
Well, it could be.

17:18.340 --> 17:20.691
The only problem is we gotta
figure out how to get this

17:20.822 --> 17:21.823
inside another
one of those things

17:21.953 --> 17:23.129
without getting
ourselves killed.

17:24.956 --> 17:27.002
You have a gun, right?

17:27.133 --> 17:28.960
Yeah.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.267
So make some
silver bullets.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.403
Huh.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.057
No, you're making that up.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.494
I'm not.
Julie, tell him it's real.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.017
What's real?

17:42.148 --> 17:44.193
The Internet.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.021
Oh. Yeah, yeah,
that's a thing.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.718
Told you.

17:47.849 --> 17:50.069
[speaks Cantonese]
You come carry.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.244
You're up.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.335
Are you just gonna
wear that thing all day?

17:56.945 --> 17:57.728
I like it.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.078
It smells musty.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.517
[speaks Cantonese]

18:03.647 --> 18:04.648
You put here.

18:12.830 --> 18:13.962
What's this?

18:16.573 --> 18:18.532
Where did you...

18:18.662 --> 18:20.011
Where did you
get that?

18:20.142 --> 18:21.361
It was in the pocket.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.148
What's wrong?

18:29.673 --> 18:32.981
[sniffling]
I need you to be brave.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.678
[Jade]
There you are! He's in here!

18:36.071 --> 18:37.942
-Listen, we gotta talk.
-I have to go.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.422
-Huh? Nah. Come here.
-[Ethan] Hey, what're you doing?

18:39.553 --> 18:40.858
-Hey!
-We made a deal, remember?

18:40.989 --> 18:42.730
I play you the song,
you tell me about the symbol.

18:42.860 --> 18:43.818
Hey!
Leave him alone.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.125
I told you
about the symbol.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.604
Yeah, you sure
you told me everything?

18:47.735 --> 18:48.605
You didn't tell me you saw it
on the wall

18:48.736 --> 18:50.477
down in those tunnels!

18:50.607 --> 18:52.087
-Hey! Relax! Relax!
-[Ethan] What tunnel?

18:52.218 --> 18:52.914
Victor, we just want
to talk to you.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.307
-No, I have to go.
-Hey!

18:54.437 --> 18:55.917
-Mom, what's going on?
-Give me one reason--

18:56.047 --> 18:57.745
-Stay here, honey.
-[Jade] Right? One reason

18:57.875 --> 18:58.659
-why you wouldn't mention--
-Jade!

18:58.789 --> 19:00.226
that you saw this symbol on

19:00.356 --> 19:02.271
the wall down
in those tunnels!

19:02.402 --> 19:04.143
-Just give me one!
-It's not important.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.145
-Yes it is! Goddammit, stop!
-Hey, Jade! Stop it!

19:06.275 --> 19:07.581
-Stop it! Stop it!
-No, no!

19:07.711 --> 19:09.800
I am done fucking around!
You, hey, look at me!

19:09.931 --> 19:12.455
You don't get to pick
and choose what you tell us!

19:12.586 --> 19:14.414
Everything--
Everything you know,

19:14.544 --> 19:18.113
everything you've seen,
it all matters,

19:18.244 --> 19:20.333
because that may be
how we go home.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.947
Don't you want that?
Huh?

19:26.077 --> 19:27.775
Wouldn't you like
to go home?

19:32.736 --> 19:34.564
This is my home.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.616
What is wrong
with you?

19:42.746 --> 19:45.227
Is it just physically
impossible for you

19:45.358 --> 19:48.012
not to be an asshole
for longer than 10 minutes?

19:48.143 --> 19:49.492
Great,
you're yelling at me again.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.146
-Fuck off.
-That didn't take very long.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.452
Victor!

19:56.325 --> 19:58.284
[door opens]

20:09.469 --> 20:11.035
Sara, uh,

20:11.166 --> 20:13.299
we were wondering if we
could talk to you for a minute.

20:13.429 --> 20:14.865
About what?

20:14.996 --> 20:16.998
We're just trying to get
our head around a few things.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.217
This is Randall.
He came on--

20:18.347 --> 20:19.479
I know who he is.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.177
What do you wanna know?

20:25.485 --> 20:28.009
You came
with your brother.

20:28.139 --> 20:30.229
Where were you going?

20:30.359 --> 20:31.708
Back to Boston.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.406
Where were you
coming from?

20:33.536 --> 20:35.408
Why does it matter?

20:37.453 --> 20:38.411
What's going on?

20:38.541 --> 20:39.890
We're just trying
to figure out

20:40.021 --> 20:43.154
if there's any pattern
to how people end up here.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.852
We just want your help.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.335
Pennsylvania.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.947
I was living in New Hope,
but it--it wasn't--

20:54.688 --> 20:56.559
Nathan came to
bring me back home.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.344
So you guys were close?

21:00.520 --> 21:01.695
He was my best friend.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.394
That day at the barn--

21:05.525 --> 21:07.353
No, I don't want
to talk about that.

21:11.487 --> 21:12.532
Sara...

21:15.230 --> 21:16.536
I know you didn't
want to hurt Ethan.

21:17.841 --> 21:18.712
I know that.

21:20.801 --> 21:24.239
And what this place did to you,
it isn't fair, but please--

21:24.370 --> 21:26.023
Is your brother
still alive?

21:27.677 --> 21:28.939
What?

21:29.070 --> 21:30.376
It's a simple
fucking question.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.899
Ease up.

21:32.029 --> 21:33.074
The hell is going on?

21:33.204 --> 21:35.729
[Randall chuckles]

21:35.859 --> 21:37.687
It's convenient.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.254
Excuse me?

21:39.385 --> 21:41.256
You just show up here
out of nowhere the moment

21:41.387 --> 21:42.910
we start asking
fucking questions.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.215
What the fuck are
you talking about?

21:44.346 --> 21:45.347
Nothing.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.657
Boyd says you're looking
for ways to be helpful.

21:50.787 --> 21:52.920
I got a bunch of clothes
that need stitching. You sew?

21:54.051 --> 21:55.966
-Yeah.
-Great.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.620
Here you go.
You can start with that.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.143
You two,
get the fuck out.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.581
Who are you, huh?

22:03.060 --> 22:04.410
You think you're
some kinda big shot?

22:04.540 --> 22:06.803
Got a little power?

22:06.934 --> 22:09.240
Little pull? Huh?

22:10.416 --> 22:11.895
You like that, right?

22:14.071 --> 22:15.595
You know what you are?

22:15.725 --> 22:18.337
You're a fucking
toll booth operator.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.426
You're gonna want
to leave right now.

22:20.556 --> 22:22.819
All right,
everything's fine.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.473
Everything's okay.

22:24.604 --> 22:26.519
We're gonna go right now.
Let's go.

22:27.868 --> 22:28.869
[scoffs]

22:43.057 --> 22:44.363
You okay?

22:45.799 --> 22:48.062
Why were they
talking about Nathan?

22:48.192 --> 22:50.107
Why do they
think he's alive?

22:53.415 --> 22:54.547
-[exhales]
-What was that?

22:54.677 --> 22:56.505
What was what?

22:56.636 --> 22:57.680
You wanna figure
this thing out

22:57.811 --> 22:59.160
or you wanna be
everyone's friend?

22:59.290 --> 23:00.291
Look,
I saw the look on her face

23:00.422 --> 23:01.336
when you asked her
about Nathan.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.729
She doesn't know anything.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.078
Well, Donna might.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.559
