24:58.713 --> 25:00.380
So, what happened?

25:02.250 --> 25:03.983
What do you mean?

25:04.019 --> 25:08.688
Well, you've never come down
here just to see me before.

25:08.723 --> 25:09.923
Sure, I have.

25:09.958 --> 25:12.158
Ah! We don't do that.

25:12.194 --> 25:13.226
- [Chuckling] Oh, okay.
- You and me.

25:13.261 --> 25:16.296
- No, remember?
- Yeah.

25:16.331 --> 25:17.964
O-Okay.

25:17.999 --> 25:19.899
Okay, fine. Fine.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.201
Don't tell me anything.

25:21.236 --> 25:23.870
But then don't call me
in the middle of the night

25:23.905 --> 25:25.905
and expect me to come running here.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.775
You are not the only
man I share a bed with.

25:28.810 --> 25:30.276
Okay?

25:30.312 --> 25:34.013
And next time, maybe try
"Lucy, how are things?

25:34.049 --> 25:35.448
How's Carlos?"

25:35.484 --> 25:37.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who else
you sharing a bed with?

25:37.586 --> 25:39.652
Is that why you didn't want
me to come to your house?

25:39.688 --> 25:41.187
Is it?

25:41.223 --> 25:43.389
How's Cath?

25:43.425 --> 25:45.592
Where does she think you are right now?

25:45.627 --> 25:47.460
Smurf's.

25:47.496 --> 25:49.028
- What if she calls there?
- She won't.

25:49.064 --> 25:50.797
She wants nothing to do with her anymore.

25:50.832 --> 25:51.731
Is that your problem?

25:51.766 --> 25:54.000
No, but it's making it worse.

25:54.035 --> 25:57.070
So it's Smurf. Of course it's Smurf.

25:57.105 --> 25:58.638
Ever since Pope got out of prison,

25:58.673 --> 26:00.273
I'm on shaky ground with her, okay?

26:00.308 --> 26:01.307
- Oh, God.
- No matter what I do...

26:01.343 --> 26:02.542
- I bust my ass.
- Please.

26:02.577 --> 26:04.177
I run bullshit errands
for jobs she wants to run.

26:04.212 --> 26:08.147
Basta! Basta. Do you even hear yourself?

26:08.183 --> 26:10.183
I don't know why you put up with it.

26:10.218 --> 26:11.985
I really don't.

26:12.020 --> 26:14.587
Marco and you... the jobs you used to do,

26:14.623 --> 26:18.258
the ones you came up with...
that's what you should be doing.

26:18.293 --> 26:19.926
Your own jobs.

26:19.961 --> 26:22.695
Not running errands for her.

26:26.201 --> 26:27.734
What?

26:27.769 --> 26:30.203
Maybe you're right.

26:30.238 --> 26:31.804
You'll talk to Marco, then?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.206
No. Not Marco.

26:33.241 --> 26:35.208
But I need to start coming
up with jobs I want to run.

26:35.243 --> 26:36.609
[Sighs]

26:36.645 --> 26:39.479
Yeah, I'm glad I helped with that.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.180
[Sighs]

26:43.318 --> 26:45.118
Will you come home with me so
we can walk Carlos to school?

26:45.153 --> 26:46.386
- No, I can't.
- We can make it.

26:46.421 --> 26:48.121
I got to go. I can't.

26:50.125 --> 26:52.358
There.

26:52.394 --> 26:55.828
That's why I didn't want
you to come to my house.

27:04.806 --> 27:07.173
[Sighs]

27:15.917 --> 27:17.250
[Door opens]

27:17.285 --> 27:18.318
Smurf: Morning, sweetie.

27:18.353 --> 27:20.286
Morning.

27:20.322 --> 27:22.155
How was last night?

27:22.190 --> 27:23.289
It was okay.

27:23.325 --> 27:24.824
Yeah?

27:24.859 --> 27:27.026
So, what? New girl?

27:27.062 --> 27:29.362
Uh, no. It's just, uh...

27:29.397 --> 27:32.198
some photography show people
at school were talking about.

27:32.233 --> 27:33.533
That's all.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.902
Yeah? Was it good?

27:35.937 --> 27:36.936
Yeah, it was okay.

27:36.972 --> 27:39.839
Um, surf photos. You know. Pretty cool.

27:39.874 --> 27:41.708
Nicky not into it?

27:41.743 --> 27:45.244
No, I just... I just
wanted to do my own thing.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.780
Hey, can you do me a
favor in the next few days?

27:47.816 --> 27:49.983
Would you stop by the building on Carillo

27:50.018 --> 27:51.951
and pick up the rent checks for me?

27:51.987 --> 27:53.419
Sure.

27:53.455 --> 27:56.255
Great. They're in the lock box.

27:56.291 --> 27:59.058
Oh, but Dean in 11 never puts his there,

27:59.094 --> 28:00.994
so you're gonna have to knock on the door.

28:01.029 --> 28:02.362
No problem.

28:02.397 --> 28:04.030
Thank you, sweetie.

28:38.099 --> 28:40.133
[Creaking]

28:56.184 --> 28:59.585
Smurf's truck was parked
outside my place last night.

28:59.621 --> 29:01.854
I wasn't looking for
a lecture then, either.

29:01.890 --> 29:05.058
That was me. I was waiting for you.

29:08.963 --> 29:12.098
Look.

29:12.133 --> 29:15.401
Don't let your dish
sponges get so filthy, man.

29:15.437 --> 29:18.838
You put those things in the windowsill.

29:18.873 --> 29:20.840
The sun kills more bacteria

29:20.875 --> 29:24.143
than any of that chemical shit you can buy.

29:26.514 --> 29:29.348
Smurf send you?

29:29.384 --> 29:31.784
Yeah.

29:31.820 --> 29:35.555
Because Baz couldn't get you to come home.

29:35.590 --> 29:37.156
[Sighs]

29:41.129 --> 29:44.330
Do you ever feel like leaving, man?

29:47.001 --> 29:49.769
Sometimes, yeah. In prison.

29:52.107 --> 29:54.307
Is that what Belize was about?

29:54.342 --> 29:55.675
You want to leave?

29:57.812 --> 30:00.980
[Sighs] No, man. It's just...

30:01.015 --> 30:04.183
It's Smurf.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.119
I want to leave her.

30:09.791 --> 30:11.924
How was it down there?

30:14.429 --> 30:16.529
It was good.

30:16.564 --> 30:18.498
It was really good.

30:22.303 --> 30:24.403
Hey, you remember Wayne Cullen?

30:24.439 --> 30:26.439
Should I?

30:26.474 --> 30:28.040
Yeah, probably.

30:28.076 --> 30:31.177
When I was 11, you beat
the shit out of him.

30:31.212 --> 30:34.247
Why?

30:34.282 --> 30:38.451
I asked you to.

30:38.486 --> 30:39.786
You didn't ask me why.

30:39.821 --> 30:42.288
I just told you to beat
up a kid named Wayne.

30:45.193 --> 30:47.160
What are you saying?

30:51.733 --> 30:56.803
I'm saying if you do something
and you don't ask me why...

30:59.741 --> 31:01.741
...I'll come home.

31:18.318 --> 31:19.799
[Engine shuts off]

31:19.834 --> 31:24.103
This is it. That's where he works.

31:24.139 --> 31:26.139
Okay.

31:26.174 --> 31:27.240
Wait here.

31:27.275 --> 31:28.308
What? No.

31:28.343 --> 31:31.077
I'm coming. I want to see this.

31:31.112 --> 31:32.512
Trust me.

You don't.

Man: Hey, man.

31:58.206 --> 31:59.606
What are you doing?

31:59.641 --> 32:02.175
I have to mess you up a little.

32:02.210 --> 32:03.376
What?

32:03.411 --> 32:05.612
It's a shitty situation for the both of us.

32:05.647 --> 32:07.313
Who are you?

32:07.349 --> 32:11.651
Maybe a black eye, make you bleed a little,

32:11.686 --> 32:15.288
and then you're gonna run down
the street screaming, okay?

32:15.323 --> 32:18.691
Doesn't have to be a big deal.

32:19.961 --> 32:21.227
Doesn't have to be like that.

32:21.262 --> 32:23.963
Seriously. Put it... Ohh!

32:23.999 --> 32:26.265
[Groans] Shit, that hurt!

32:26.301 --> 32:29.402
Yeah, there's more where
that came from, asshole.

32:29.437 --> 32:33.139
So I guess it <i>does</i>
have to be like that!

Shit!

32:54.362 --> 32:55.762
[Crying continues]

32:55.797 --> 32:57.964
It was hilarious.

32:57.999 --> 32:59.766
All the way home, my parents were going on

32:59.801 --> 33:02.301
about what a strong single mother Smurf is.

33:02.337 --> 33:04.937
Which is amazing, given the
fact that they just found out

33:04.973 --> 33:08.408
I've been sleeping <i>with</i> you
at her house behind their backs.

33:08.443 --> 33:12.545
Smurf is seriously badass.
That woman gets shit done.

33:12.580 --> 33:14.614
Are you listening?

33:14.649 --> 33:16.249
Uh...

33:16.284 --> 33:17.283
Sorry. I forgot.

33:17.318 --> 33:19.619
I got to pick up rent checks for Smurf.

33:19.654 --> 33:20.620
Right now?

33:20.655 --> 33:21.688
Yeah, she needs them tonight.

33:21.723 --> 33:23.089
I'll call you later!

33:56.357 --> 33:59.726
Good eye. That's one of my faves.

33:59.761 --> 34:01.394
I'm Lila.

34:01.429 --> 34:03.663
Oh, wow. You're the photographer.

34:03.698 --> 34:05.698
- Yeah.
- Hi. I'm Diane.

34:05.734 --> 34:08.900
These are... great pictures.

34:08.937 --> 34:11.036
Thank you. [Laughs]

34:11.072 --> 34:15.942
But this one... you
know, I'm not 100% sure,

34:15.976 --> 34:18.543
it's been ages, but I
think I knew this guy.

34:18.580 --> 34:20.179
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:20.215 --> 34:21.647
[Laughs]

34:21.683 --> 34:23.683
Boy, I'd love to get back
in touch with him again.

34:23.717 --> 34:25.851
You know any way I could reach him?

34:25.887 --> 34:27.987
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

34:28.022 --> 34:29.989
Afraid I can't share that info with you.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.592
- No?
- No.

34:32.627 --> 34:35.027
Every photo I shoot is a relationship.

34:35.063 --> 34:36.496
It's brief but intimate.

34:36.531 --> 34:38.464
And many of my subjects have,

34:38.500 --> 34:40.699
you know, dropped out of conventional life.

34:40.735 --> 34:42.034
Mm.

34:42.070 --> 34:43.835
For various reasons.

34:43.871 --> 34:47.306
So, in exchange for a
fleeting moment of truth,

34:47.342 --> 34:49.675
I promise them anonymity.

34:49.710 --> 34:50.976
What?

34:51.012 --> 34:54.147
That sounds like a load of bullshit to me.

34:54.181 --> 34:55.915
If you don't want to tell me, just say,

34:55.949 --> 34:57.316
"It's none of your damn business."

34:57.352 --> 34:59.185
[Laughs] Okay.

34:59.220 --> 35:00.820
Mm-hmm.

35:00.855 --> 35:02.822
It's none of your damn business.

35:02.857 --> 35:05.591
Thank you. I appreciate it.

35:05.627 --> 35:08.327
Now, you know what that was?

35:08.363 --> 35:11.931
<i>That</i> was a fleeting moment of truth.

35:11.966 --> 35:14.734
Yeah. It kind of was, wasn't it?

35:14.769 --> 35:15.802
Mm-hmm.

35:32.954 --> 35:34.387
What?

35:34.422 --> 35:35.621
Smurf sent me.

35:35.657 --> 35:38.024
Your... Your rent... it's not in the box.

35:40.795 --> 35:43.896
You want to come in? I
just got some amazing weed.

35:43.932 --> 35:45.064
Have a hit.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.133
I'm... I'm good.

35:47.168 --> 35:48.801
Just the rent is...

35:48.837 --> 35:49.836
Seriously.

35:49.871 --> 35:52.872
This stuff... mind-blowing.

35:52.907 --> 35:55.942
Just the rent.

36:01.316 --> 36:03.583
Don't be an idiot, kid.

36:03.618 --> 36:08.287
How about I give you some
weed and in a few days,

36:08.323 --> 36:10.289
you come back for the rent?

36:10.325 --> 36:13.893
Only person who wins is you.

36:13.928 --> 36:17.964
If you don't give me the rent,
I'm gonna have to tell Smurf.

36:17.999 --> 36:19.932
You little prick.

36:19.968 --> 36:21.300
I asked you nicely.

36:21.336 --> 36:22.869
I asked <i>you</i> nicely.

36:22.904 --> 36:24.170
The rent.

36:26.774 --> 36:28.474
Okay, man.

36:31.779 --> 36:33.980
No hard feelings, huh?

36:41.389 --> 36:42.655
[Exhales sharply]

36:42.690 --> 36:45.191

[Birds chirping]

37:05.146 --> 37:06.312
Hey.

37:06.347 --> 37:08.681
Hey. Thanks.

37:08.716 --> 37:10.583
Sure. Where's J?

37:10.618 --> 37:12.952
I don't know.

37:12.987 --> 37:14.720
We were at the beach
and he was being weird,

37:14.756 --> 37:16.923
and all of a sudden, he said
he had to go get rent checks

37:16.958 --> 37:18.791
for Smurf, and now he's
not answering his phone.

37:18.826 --> 37:20.793
I mean, for what it's worth,

37:20.828 --> 37:22.628
I'm sure he did have to
run an errand for Smurf.

37:22.664 --> 37:23.663
Mm.

37:23.698 --> 37:25.865
Tends to work that way around here.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.433
Cheers.

37:27.468 --> 37:31.337
So, your mom... she's
not your real mom, huh?

37:31.372 --> 37:33.606
Really, you could tell?
What was your first clue?

37:33.641 --> 37:35.074
I don't know. Her accent?

37:35.109 --> 37:36.776
[Giggles]

37:36.811 --> 37:38.377
My mom took off...

37:38.413 --> 37:40.413
or he ran her off, more likely.

37:40.448 --> 37:41.614
She's not around.

37:41.649 --> 37:44.617
Well, I really liked your dad.

37:44.652 --> 37:45.685
He seems very cool.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.486
- [Scoffs]
- No, he seems very cool.

37:47.522 --> 37:48.854
He loved you.

37:48.890 --> 37:50.289
Thanks for putting up with him.

37:50.325 --> 37:51.657
I wasn't putting up with him.

37:51.693 --> 37:53.292
I mean, not everyone's work stories

37:53.328 --> 37:54.694
are all that interesting.

37:54.729 --> 37:56.062
What? They were!

37:56.097 --> 37:58.197
That pallet of money story,
man... that was crazy.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.399
[Laughs] Oh, God. Please.

38:00.435 --> 38:03.903
That story's from 2003.
He's hit the camo ceiling.

38:03.938 --> 38:06.672
He's like a glorified
Navy bank manager now.

38:06.708 --> 38:08.374
- Hmm.
- [Giggles]

38:08.409 --> 38:10.042
He just made Lieutenant
Commander, though, right?

38:10.078 --> 38:12.178
Yeah, after being passed over
like three times in a row.

38:12.213 --> 38:13.679
Mm.

38:13.715 --> 38:14.914
His boss has it out for him.

38:14.949 --> 38:16.315
I don't know.

38:16.351 --> 38:18.584
It still sounds like he's
got a lot of responsibility.

38:18.619 --> 38:20.386
- He likes to think so.
- [Chuckles]

38:20.421 --> 38:23.389
He acts like he has the
nuclear codes in his briefcase.

38:23.424 --> 38:24.757
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:24.792 --> 38:27.093
The other day, he freaked
when I moved his briefcase

38:27.128 --> 38:28.361
off the dining room table.

38:28.396 --> 38:30.763
All his classified documents and shit?

38:30.798 --> 38:33.099
[Scoffs] Right. Whatever
makes you feel important.

38:33.134 --> 38:34.834
Well, I liked him.

38:34.869 --> 38:38.204
I just wish he'd chill out a little.

38:45.847 --> 38:48.080
So, that guy in the photo.

38:48.116 --> 38:50.316
And you don't have to tell me his name.

38:50.351 --> 38:52.618
[Sighs]

38:52.653 --> 38:54.186
Was he a teacher?

38:54.222 --> 38:55.488
[Laughs]

38:55.523 --> 38:56.956
The quiet type?

38:56.991 --> 38:58.624
No! A teacher?

38:58.659 --> 38:59.892
Yeah.

38:59.927 --> 39:03.629
I don't think it's the person
you're thinking of, okay?

39:03.664 --> 39:04.864
Why not?

39:04.899 --> 39:06.899
Mm.

39:06.934 --> 39:09.802
[Sighs] 'Cause the dude creeped me out.

39:09.837 --> 39:13.406
There was something really off about him.

39:13.441 --> 39:14.740
- Yeah.
- Really?

39:14.776 --> 39:15.908
Yeah.

39:15.943 --> 39:17.410
Well, maybe it wasn't him.

39:17.445 --> 39:18.711
Yeah.

39:18.746 --> 39:20.312
But it looked like him.

39:20.348 --> 39:21.647
- [Laughs]
- It looked like him.

39:21.682 --> 39:24.050
A teacher? No.

39:24.085 --> 39:25.317
He had a hustler vibe.

39:25.353 --> 39:29.021
He had an airplane hangar.

39:29.057 --> 39:30.589
Uh-huh.

39:33.928 --> 39:35.294
Airplane hangar.

39:35.329 --> 39:36.362
Yeah.

39:38.266 --> 39:39.698
You're insane.

39:39.734 --> 39:41.700
[Giggles]

39:41.736 --> 39:44.103
- [Sighs] Man.
- Airplane hangar.

39:44.138 --> 39:47.173
Yes. He had an airplane hangar...

39:47.208 --> 39:51.677
and it was filled with
classic cars in Santa Clarita,

39:51.712 --> 39:54.680
and God knows where he got those.

39:54.715 --> 39:56.449
[Sighs]

39:56.484 --> 39:59.118
I only know 'cause he
contacted me out of the blue

39:59.153 --> 40:01.854
a couple years ago and
wanted to buy a print.

40:01.889 --> 40:03.089
Mm-hmm.

40:03.124 --> 40:05.324
But he, like, wanted the negatives, too,

40:05.359 --> 40:06.826
and he had changed his name.

40:06.861 --> 40:08.661
He was acting all paranoid about it.

40:08.696 --> 40:10.830
- I don't know.
- Oh.

40:10.865 --> 40:13.232
I guess he really wasn't the guy.

40:13.267 --> 40:14.333
[Sighs]

40:14.368 --> 40:15.901
[Giggles]

40:23.344 --> 40:25.044
[Loud knock on door]

40:25.079 --> 40:26.979
[Dog barks in distance]

40:30.318 --> 40:32.084
[Loud knock on door]

40:36.791 --> 40:38.924
Hi. What are you doing here?

40:40.862 --> 40:41.994
[Door closes]

40:46.267 --> 40:48.134
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:48.169 --> 40:49.802
We can't... We can't do this.

40:53.674 --> 40:55.207
Okay.

40:57.044 --> 40:58.944
I'll see you in class.

41:20.201 --> 41:23.102
Nice boat.

41:23.137 --> 41:25.304
Charters are closed for the night.

41:25.339 --> 41:26.605
Why?

41:26.641 --> 41:29.041
The water too choppy?

41:29.076 --> 41:32.778
Yeah, she's a beauty.

41:34.015 --> 41:35.381
[Object thuds twice]

41:37.185 --> 41:38.384
[Electricity crackles]

41:38.419 --> 41:40.920
[Screaming, groaning]

41:43.991 --> 41:45.457
Yeah.

41:51.290 --> 41:53.190
[Waves crashing]

42:04.870 --> 42:08.505
I forgot how beautiful it is out here.

42:20.285 --> 42:22.452
- Yeah. Get up.
- No, no. No!

42:23.389 --> 42:25.022
Give me your hands.

42:27.326 --> 42:30.494
Listen, man. Whatever
you want, I didn't do it.

42:30.529 --> 42:31.495
I swear to God I didn't...

42:31.530 --> 42:32.929
No!

42:35.534 --> 42:37.334
[Coughing]

42:37.369 --> 42:40.370
Wait, man!

42:40.406 --> 42:41.972
You're just gonna leave me out here?!

42:42.007 --> 42:43.807
You'll make it in.

42:43.842 --> 42:45.909
It's over a mile!

42:45.944 --> 42:47.778
Maybe two.

42:47.813 --> 42:49.513
What'd I do, man?

42:49.548 --> 42:50.580
What?

42:50.616 --> 42:53.183
I don't even know.

42:56.588 --> 42:59.022
[Coughing]

42:59.058 --> 43:01.825
[Engine starts]

44:00.552 --> 44:03.320
Hi there, kiddo.

44:18.270 --> 44:19.970
What?

44:20.005 --> 44:22.339
Nothin'.

44:22.374 --> 44:25.776
Just, um...

44:25.811 --> 44:28.345
Thank you for having my back.

44:28.380 --> 44:33.083
A lot of people say they do and then bail.

44:35.621 --> 44:38.688
Overdosing scared the
hell out of me, you know?

44:38.724 --> 44:41.958
So, you getting my stuff
back... it means a lot.

44:41.994 --> 44:45.462
I want to give you something.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.566
It's okay.

44:49.601 --> 44:51.535
Really.

44:51.570 --> 44:54.971
Pills or powder?

44:55.007 --> 44:56.640
Well, if it's important to you...

44:56.675 --> 44:58.074
[Laughs]

45:01.747 --> 45:03.580
Powder.

45:10.155 --> 45:11.955
You can watch.

45:15.961 --> 45:17.494
I trust you.

45:23.635 --> 45:25.368
[Tires screech]

45:25.404 --> 45:26.503
[Gull cries]

45:26.538 --> 45:28.505
Are you crazy?

45:28.540 --> 45:31.241
You sent one of your
thug brothers after Dave?!

45:31.276 --> 45:33.443
He nearly died.

45:33.478 --> 45:35.812
What happened?

45:35.848 --> 45:37.581
Is this how it's gonna work?

45:37.616 --> 45:38.982
Every time I meet a guy,

45:39.017 --> 45:41.151
you send someone to almost kill him?

45:41.186 --> 45:42.519
Oh, it's sick, Smurf's hold over you.

45:42.554 --> 45:43.653
You know that, right?

45:43.689 --> 45:44.754
Look, this has nothing to do with Smurf.

45:44.790 --> 45:45.989
Bullshit.

45:46.024 --> 45:47.557
It has everything to do with her.

45:47.593 --> 45:50.160
What would Smurf do with a son
who doesn't want to screw her?

45:50.195 --> 45:52.128
That's your biggest fear, isn't it?

45:52.164 --> 45:55.031
Being out in the cold without Mommy's love?

46:00.205 --> 46:02.072
I'll see you tonight.

46:25.264 --> 46:27.163
[Dog barks in distance]

46:52.791 --> 46:55.358
Hi, Mama.

46:55.394 --> 46:57.460
Hey, baby.

47:18.450 --> 47:20.650
[Helicopter blades whirring]

47:31.563 --> 47:34.597
Yeah, I got the checks.

47:34.633 --> 47:37.867
That was quick.

47:37.903 --> 47:39.469
Did you have any trouble?

47:41.273 --> 47:44.741
Dean said he gave you a pretty hard time.

47:44.776 --> 47:46.910
Just like I told him to.

47:52.384 --> 47:54.751
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

47:57.756 --> 48:00.390
- Morning.
- Morning.

48:00.425 --> 48:03.093
[Laughs] You're in a good mood.

48:03.128 --> 48:04.894
- I'm in a great mood.
- Good.

48:04.930 --> 48:06.863
Did you get any licenses last night?

48:06.898 --> 48:08.098
Forget about the port.

48:08.133 --> 48:10.567
I have an idea for a job.

48:10.602 --> 48:12.602
- Maybe something big.
- Mm.

48:12.637 --> 48:14.604
What is it?

48:14.639 --> 48:16.539
I need some lead time,
see what comes of it.

48:16.575 --> 48:19.743
Okay. We can talk about it.

48:21.780 --> 48:23.847
Hey, man.

48:23.882 --> 48:25.348
No Deran?

48:29.354 --> 48:31.321
Pope: Yeah.

48:35.193 --> 48:37.394
Let's have some Bloody Marys.

48:47.472 --> 48:49.039
[Gull cries]

49:07.626 --> 49:09.759
Detective.

49:14.499 --> 49:17.367
How was the exhibit?

49:17.402 --> 49:19.536
You tell me.

49:19.571 --> 49:21.438
You did good.

49:21.473 --> 49:24.974
You got J opening up about his family.

49:25.010 --> 49:27.811
Look, why'd you want to meet?

49:27.846 --> 49:32.315
From what I heard on the wire, you like J.

49:32.350 --> 49:35.251
Which is why this is gonna work.
