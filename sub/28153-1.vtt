02:41.591 --> 02:43.891
You won't get it
in a million years.

02:43.893 --> 02:45.896
No way.

02:48.264 --> 02:50.865
Spy stuff?

02:50.867 --> 02:53.567
Ah, lucky guess.

02:53.569 --> 02:57.905
Yeah, alright!
High-five!

02:57.907 --> 02:59.506
So cool.
Can I play with it?

02:59.508 --> 03:02.977
No, Of course not!

03:02.979 --> 03:06.212
- Hogger.
- Agh, boys.

03:06.214 --> 03:08.414
- Hey, where's Frankie?
- Frankie?

03:08.416 --> 03:12.218
Yeah.
He's in his secret room.

03:12.220 --> 03:15.088
- And there goes the queen.
- Sorry, guys.

03:24.332 --> 03:27.033
Are you gonna spend
all night down here?

03:27.035 --> 03:30.270
The sled's almost perfect.

03:30.272 --> 03:34.040
You take this stuff
way too seriously.

03:34.042 --> 03:36.341
You don't have to beat
the new kid.

03:36.343 --> 03:40.113
He challenged me.
What else can I do?

03:40.115 --> 03:42.414
- Come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:42.416 --> 03:44.484
Just a few more minutes.

03:44.486 --> 03:48.154
Okay. See ya
in the morning, genius.

03:48.156 --> 03:53.192
Zac does not know
what he's up against.

04:17.384 --> 04:19.552
Finished.

04:19.553 --> 04:22.091
And four-eyes is finished too.

04:24.191 --> 04:25.325
Hm?

04:27.294 --> 04:28.496
Hm.

05:01.761 --> 05:03.729
- Whoa!
- Behave.

05:03.731 --> 05:06.968
Eww. Argh, guys!

05:40.298 --> 05:44.235
Frankie, go to sleep.

05:44.237 --> 05:46.173
I need to measure something.

05:47.740 --> 05:50.574
The gap between the sled runner
and the steering column

05:50.576 --> 05:53.443
can't be greater
than the thickness of a feather.

05:53.445 --> 05:56.613
Great.
That's what I thought.

05:56.615 --> 05:58.548
I think
I'm actually going to break

05:58.550 --> 06:01.020
my own speed record tomorrow.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.422
Break a sleep record.

06:05.424 --> 06:08.995
Great. Me too.

06:14.198 --> 06:15.501
Huh?

06:21.672 --> 06:23.439
- What?
- Ah!

06:28.080 --> 06:30.016
What did you eat?

06:41.393 --> 06:43.759
It's race day, folks!
Time to roll!

06:43.761 --> 06:45.394
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hurry up, guys!

06:45.396 --> 06:48.529
Let's go show that new kid
who's boss.

06:48.531 --> 06:49.664
Yeah!

06:49.666 --> 06:51.566
Hey, Frankie, remember,

06:51.568 --> 06:53.402
this is supposed to be fun,
right?

06:53.404 --> 06:57.505
You know what is fun?
Winning, like we always do.

06:57.507 --> 07:00.375
Oh, yeah.

07:00.377 --> 07:03.412
Whoo!

07:03.414 --> 07:06.214
I can't wait. I love sleeping
here the night before.

07:19.729 --> 07:21.729
I wasn't dreaming.

07:21.731 --> 07:24.366
Come here, little guy.
Come here.

07:24.368 --> 07:27.105
Oh, you are so cute.

07:28.238 --> 07:29.871
Do you like sleepovers too?

07:31.207 --> 07:32.440
Stop.

07:32.442 --> 07:35.079
The barn's for everyone.
Even puppies.

07:39.816 --> 07:41.516
Where'd you come from?

07:41.518 --> 07:44.154
Puppies aren't supposed
to wander around in the cold.

07:49.626 --> 07:52.429
It's race day!

07:56.499 --> 07:57.798
That's right.

07:57.800 --> 08:02.202
The Sixth Annual
Slederator race!

08:02.204 --> 08:03.603
Yeah!

08:03.605 --> 08:06.642
And let's go
right to the first race.

08:09.511 --> 08:10.911
- There's no room for you.
- I was here first.

08:10.913 --> 08:12.715
- I'm the driver.
- No, I'm the driver.

08:16.485 --> 08:18.252
And they're off!

08:18.254 --> 08:22.223
To a very slow start.

08:22.225 --> 08:24.256
Whoa!

08:24.258 --> 08:27.394
Steer, Manolo! Steer!

08:27.396 --> 08:29.699
How do you steer a box?

08:33.234 --> 08:36.304
Look at me go!

08:40.241 --> 08:41.707
Woo-hoo-hoo!

08:44.912 --> 08:47.581
- Whoa!
- Woohoo!

08:47.583 --> 08:49.815
- Yes!
- And we have a tie!

08:49.817 --> 08:52.452
- Photo finish!
- Did you get a picture?

08:52.454 --> 08:54.788
I'm Daniel Blanshire
from Victoriaville.

08:54.790 --> 08:56.823
I got lots of pictures

08:56.825 --> 08:59.425
So? Who won?

08:59.427 --> 09:01.261
Um, sorry.

09:01.263 --> 09:03.862
I... I seem to have missed
that one.

09:03.864 --> 09:06.232
You what?

09:06.234 --> 09:08.834
Whoa!

09:08.836 --> 09:11.371
Here, hold him for me.
I'll be right back.

09:11.373 --> 09:14.005
Oh, he's so cute.
Where did he come from?

09:14.007 --> 09:16.911
Okay! Is this a puppy party
or a race?

09:18.345 --> 09:22.481
Ready! Blow the bugle!
Do it!

09:22.483 --> 09:27.620
And they're off
on this exciting second race.

09:30.824 --> 09:32.258
Piers is having
some trouble

09:32.260 --> 09:34.462
controlling his sled tire.

09:35.997 --> 09:37.996
Whoa!

09:37.998 --> 09:39.999
Lucy!

09:40.001 --> 09:41.766
I'm gonna get you! Ooh!

09:41.768 --> 09:43.769
Aah!

09:43.771 --> 09:46.538
Hey, come back here!

09:49.609 --> 09:51.376
Whoa-ho-ho!

09:51.378 --> 09:53.711
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:02.889 --> 10:06.724
Oh, yeah! Woohoo!

10:07.927 --> 10:09.994
Rats!

10:09.996 --> 10:12.696
And a victory for Lucy!

10:12.698 --> 10:14.865
I planned the whole thing!

10:14.867 --> 10:18.238
I'm okay.

10:26.846 --> 10:29.480
I've got Chuck making some
last-minute improvements

10:29.482 --> 10:31.682
to the sled,
and with you driving,

10:31.684 --> 10:34.518
we're gonna make history.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.053
Oh, this is gonna be good.

10:36.055 --> 10:37.488
Frankie, with your sleds,

10:37.490 --> 10:39.523
you're making history
every year.

10:39.525 --> 10:42.726
Okay, okay,
coming through.

10:44.396 --> 10:45.833
Ugh, make way.

10:49.934 --> 10:52.435
Hmm.

10:52.437 --> 10:55.372
Ugh. Amateur-ville.

10:55.374 --> 10:58.508
Is that him?
I don't like him.

10:58.510 --> 11:01.677
No sweat.
He's obviously all show.

11:02.847 --> 11:04.348
Hmm.

11:06.751 --> 11:08.618
Oh, did I do that?

11:08.620 --> 11:10.887
So sorry.

11:10.889 --> 11:13.089
Here, have a candy cane.

11:13.091 --> 11:17.027
Never take candy
from a stranger.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.133
Well, where's my ratchet?

11:24.135 --> 11:27.403
- One ratchet coming up.
- You...

11:32.477 --> 11:34.844
Ah.

11:36.714 --> 11:40.949
Hi, I'm Charlie,
Zac's cousin.

11:40.951 --> 11:43.886
I'm driving his sled.

11:43.888 --> 11:46.555
- What's your name?
- Who? Me?

11:46.557 --> 11:49.691
Uh, um, Chu... Chu...

11:49.693 --> 11:51.893
Chu...

11:51.895 --> 11:53.963
Chu...

11:53.965 --> 11:55.765
Chu...

11:55.767 --> 11:57.766
You're called Chacha?

11:57.768 --> 12:01.469
No, no, no. Chuck.
Name's Chuck.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.439
Not the legendary Chuck?

12:03.441 --> 12:07.108
They say you're the strongest
guy in the village.

12:07.110 --> 12:10.047
Uh, um, yeah.

12:11.983 --> 12:14.583
- Hm.
- Hey, do you work out?

12:14.585 --> 12:18.521
Well,
I... I don't really need to.

12:18.523 --> 12:20.122
I just, uh, lift things a lot.

12:20.124 --> 12:23.957
Okay, you're funny.
You're funny.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.664
I have to go now
to get ready for the race.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.834
Good luck.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.808
And the main event
is coming up!

12:39.810 --> 12:44.879
Frankie going for his sixth win
against newcomer Zac.

12:44.881 --> 12:48.616
For those of you who don't know,
Sophie is driving for Frankie

12:48.618 --> 12:51.986
and Zac's cousin, Charlie,
is driving for him.

12:53.889 --> 12:57.692
Thank you, thank you!

12:57.694 --> 13:00.929
Whoa, mama!

13:00.931 --> 13:03.731
That is some sled!

13:03.733 --> 13:06.137
It's so shiny!

13:08.104 --> 13:09.971
Candy cane?

13:09.973 --> 13:12.905
No, thanks.
I never eat before a race.

13:12.907 --> 13:15.042
You seem pretty confident
for a guy

13:15.044 --> 13:19.580
who hasn't won the Slederator
five years in a row.

13:19.582 --> 13:21.682
You seem pretty confident
for a guy

13:21.684 --> 13:24.551
who's about to start
his losing streak.

13:24.553 --> 13:27.154
Alright then, okay.
I see what you're doing.

13:31.593 --> 13:34.126
Hey, I'm Sophie.
You must be Charlie.

13:34.128 --> 13:37.197
- I hear you're a good driver.
- Oh, that's so nice.

13:37.199 --> 13:39.202
I heard the same about you.

13:43.805 --> 13:46.139

Nothing's broken.

You have all your bones?

I'm okay, thanks for asking.

16:05.411 --> 16:08.078
What did you do to it?

16:08.080 --> 16:11.681
Nothing. Weren't you watching?
It fell apart.

16:11.683 --> 16:15.819
There's no way
my sled could just fall apart.

16:15.821 --> 16:19.122
Are you saying it was my fault?

16:19.124 --> 16:21.758
Guys, chill.

16:21.760 --> 16:26.762
I can't believe you would take
the side of the sled over me!

16:26.764 --> 16:30.400
It's just... you know
I take pride in my workmanship.

16:30.402 --> 16:33.935
I will never drive
one of your crummy sleds again.

16:33.937 --> 16:38.441
Crummy sled?
How dare you!

16:38.443 --> 16:41.711
Guys, come on. You're friends!

16:41.713 --> 16:45.313
- Were friends.
- Well, ditto.

16:45.315 --> 16:48.217
- Goodbye.
- Ugh!

17:05.703 --> 17:09.705
- Yeah!
- Congratulations, Mr. Zac.

17:09.708 --> 17:12.406
Mm, thank you,
yes, thank you.

17:12.409 --> 17:14.876
Thank you. Thank you.

17:14.877 --> 17:17.478
- Mm, yes, thank you.
- Three cheers for the winner!

17:17.480 --> 17:20.047
From the bottom of my heart,

17:20.049 --> 17:23.452
thank you all,
you rustic villagers.

17:23.454 --> 17:26.186
By the way,
I love rustic villagers.

17:26.189 --> 17:28.857
- Yay!
- That was amazing, yeah!

17:28.859 --> 17:32.393
I will cherish this trophy

17:32.395 --> 17:36.197
because I earned it
and really, really wanted it.

17:36.199 --> 17:39.167
And now, I got it!

17:39.169 --> 17:44.272
And as a special treat,
I've got a victory show for you.

17:44.274 --> 17:47.908
- Oh.
- My cousin, Charlie!

17:47.910 --> 17:50.745
Zac, I wasn't gonna sing.

17:50.747 --> 17:53.047
Come on, let's milk it.

17:53.049 --> 17:56.051
You're the one who always says
you wanna be famous.

17:56.053 --> 17:59.320
Well, I guess I could.

17:59.322 --> 18:02.089
Here goes!

18:02.091 --> 18:06.060
♪ Ha-ha-ha-ah-ah-o-o-o ♪

18:06.062 --> 18:10.030
♪ Ha-ha-ha-ah-ah-o-o-o ♪

18:10.032 --> 18:14.435
♪ What if
we played it all or nothing ♪

18:14.437 --> 18:17.972
♪ Holding on to this moment
in time ♪

18:17.974 --> 18:22.076
♪ Oh oh-oh-oh ♪

18:22.078 --> 18:27.447
♪ Ha-ha-ha-ah-ah-o-o-o ♪♪

18:29.017 --> 18:31.918
That was just beautiful!

18:31.920 --> 18:34.855
Isn't she amazing, everyone?

18:34.857 --> 18:38.192
Charlie! Charlie!
Charlie! Charlie!

18:38.194 --> 18:39.793
Woohoo!

18:39.795 --> 18:41.361
We love Charlie!
We love Charlie!

18:41.363 --> 18:44.231
And Zac! Zac too!

18:44.233 --> 18:46.867
- We love Charlie!
- Thank you!

18:46.869 --> 18:49.772
- Thank you, everyone!
- We love Charlie!

18:55.510 --> 19:00.245
You know, if the puppy's
owner doesn't show up

19:00.247 --> 19:03.383
I might have to keep him.

19:03.385 --> 19:05.451
It just doesn't make sense.

19:05.453 --> 19:08.588
My sled was designed to survive
re-entry from low earth orbit!

19:08.590 --> 19:12.358
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
It's just a race.

19:12.360 --> 19:16.295
It's a nightmare.
Somebody, pinch me.

19:16.297 --> 19:19.232
You'll wake up.
I know you.

19:22.504 --> 19:24.604
Give me that.

19:24.606 --> 19:28.407
Put it down, puppy.
We're going home.

19:28.409 --> 19:30.210
Later!

19:32.981 --> 19:35.984
Duh!
It just doesn't make any sense.

20:09.949 --> 20:11.418
Hm.

20:15.054 --> 20:16.954
That's weird.

20:16.956 --> 20:20.524
The steering bolt is missing.

20:20.526 --> 20:23.129
What have we got here?

20:38.043 --> 20:40.978
Hmm.

20:46.953 --> 20:48.522
Mint.

20:56.295 --> 20:58.995
- Look!
- Huh?

20:58.997 --> 21:02.066
Look what I found!

21:02.068 --> 21:04.635
Uh, what,
what am I looking at here?

21:04.637 --> 21:08.472
Candy cane dust!

21:08.474 --> 21:12.241
Oh, candy cane dust.

21:12.243 --> 21:16.346
It was all over the wreckage.
I suspect foul play.

21:16.348 --> 21:19.481
I think Zac cheated!

21:19.483 --> 21:21.617
Was there any moment
when Zac could have slipped in

21:21.619 --> 21:23.286
and tampered with the steering?

21:23.288 --> 21:25.288
Uh, no, I was there

21:25.290 --> 21:28.994
and then
Charlie came over.

21:31.663 --> 21:36.066
Well, while you were making
goo-goo eyes at Charlie,

21:36.068 --> 21:41.104
that sneak Zac switched
the steering bolt with this!

21:41.106 --> 21:43.205
The candy cane dust?

21:43.207 --> 21:45.141
- I don't know.
- Oh!

21:45.143 --> 21:47.443
So how long
are you staying at granny's?

21:47.445 --> 21:50.279
Who knows? Until whenever
my parents remember

21:50.281 --> 21:52.548
I'm here, I guess.

21:52.550 --> 21:56.185
Hey, you! Cheater! Stop!

22:00.057 --> 22:02.524
Oh, it's you.

22:02.526 --> 22:05.527
I'm surprised you can hold
your head up so high

22:05.529 --> 22:08.029
after such an embarrassing day.

22:08.031 --> 22:11.333
Uh, oh, you... No!

22:11.335 --> 22:15.037
I know all about this!

22:15.039 --> 22:18.239
Huh? About what?

22:18.241 --> 22:20.008
Someone ate your sandwich?

22:20.010 --> 22:23.011
What do you have to say
when I say the words

22:23.013 --> 22:25.582
candy cane?

22:27.084 --> 22:29.450
Candy cane.

22:29.452 --> 22:32.054
Delicious treats.
Great for hangin' on trees.

22:32.056 --> 22:34.123
Goodnight, loser.

22:34.125 --> 22:38.027
Don't you
walk away from me!

22:38.029 --> 22:40.162
If you wanna accuse me
of cheating,

22:40.164 --> 22:42.564
you'll need
actual, visible proof!

22:44.167 --> 22:47.067
Relax, Frankie.
Maybe he didn't cheat.

22:47.069 --> 22:49.636
Hey, you can't win every race.

22:49.638 --> 22:52.608
Yes, I can! You think...

22:54.044 --> 22:55.713
Come with me!

23:04.653 --> 23:07.388
- Lucy!
- Aah!

23:07.390 --> 23:10.525
Don't you know better than to
creep up on a kid hard at work?

23:10.527 --> 23:14.429
Sorry, but this is good.
Real good.

23:14.431 --> 23:18.266
We have every reason to believe
that Zac cheated.

23:18.268 --> 23:22.536
Yeah, and we're going
on a top secret spy mission.

23:22.538 --> 23:26.239
I'm assembling a team
of top-notch super agents

23:26.241 --> 23:29.477
to help uncover and prove
the cold hard truth!

23:31.847 --> 23:34.181
- Where did she go?
- Hey!

23:34.183 --> 23:36.115
Are you two just gonna
stand there all day

23:36.117 --> 23:38.552
flapping your gums?
Let's go!

23:38.554 --> 23:42.522
Something's come up.
I can't finish firewood duty!

23:42.524 --> 23:45.458
Uh, where are you going?

23:45.460 --> 23:49.196
Can't say. Top secret!

23:49.198 --> 23:51.700
Sophie, we're gonna find proof
that I'm right.

23:53.835 --> 23:55.802
Well, don't get
into any of his sleds

23:55.804 --> 23:57.504
if you value your life!

23:57.506 --> 24:00.739
I won't. Bye!

24:06.582 --> 24:08.715
Careful, Chuck. It's fragile.

24:08.717 --> 24:10.753
Stress much.

24:15.891 --> 24:18.891
Wow!

24:18.893 --> 24:21.862
- What is that thing?
- Shh, quiet.

24:21.864 --> 24:25.264
- Hey, guys!
- Whoa!

24:25.266 --> 24:28.070
Sorry, I'm late.

24:41.248 --> 24:42.517
Mm-hmm.

24:55.363 --> 24:57.830
Don't use up
all the hot water.

24:57.832 --> 25:00.102
He's in the shower.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.352
Time to investigate.

25:19.419 --> 25:20.752
How's the picture?

25:20.754 --> 25:23.521
Good,
but a little to the left.

25:23.523 --> 25:24.688
That's it.

25:24.690 --> 25:28.693
Whatever you do,
don't look up.

25:28.695 --> 25:32.766
- Or down.
- Curse my genius arms.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.203
Oh.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.939
Whoa!

25:48.247 --> 25:49.650
You're looking down!

25:51.450 --> 25:55.285
Whoa, he's good, like a Ninja.

25:59.425 --> 26:00.527
Huh?

26:13.605 --> 26:14.705
I'm okay.

26:17.842 --> 26:20.444
Base camp, do you read me?

26:20.446 --> 26:24.747
- Loud and clear.
- I'm going in.

26:31.657 --> 26:32.792
Ugh!

26:34.759 --> 26:39.795
Whoa, lots of awards.

26:39.797 --> 26:42.366
Do you think
he's smarter than Frankie?

26:42.368 --> 26:44.801
Never! He probably stole them!

26:44.803 --> 26:48.637
Quiet. I'm investigating.

26:48.639 --> 26:50.606
Sorry, Frankie.

26:50.608 --> 26:54.777
Oh, that bird sounds
close enough to touch.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.879
- Nope.
- Huh?

26:57.881 --> 27:02.917
Okay, Frankie,
if you were an evil fake genius

27:02.919 --> 27:04.989
where would you...

27:06.823 --> 27:08.858
Hm, hm.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.597
Where's that light coming from?

27:13.898 --> 27:15.900
Oh, owl.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.875
Hmm.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.816
Uh-oh.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.853
Wow.

27:38.855 --> 27:40.821
What? Now way!

27:40.823 --> 27:43.791
He's an evil genius?

27:43.793 --> 27:45.359
Be careful, Frankie.

27:45.361 --> 27:47.328
He might have
evil brain superpowers

27:47.330 --> 27:50.597
like mind control
or laser vision!

27:50.599 --> 27:53.734
- Let's not exaggerate.
- I'm not!

27:53.736 --> 27:58.072
His brain might be superior
to yours in every way!

27:58.074 --> 28:00.442
Lucy.

28:00.444 --> 28:04.913
There must be
a cheat sheet here somewhere.

28:04.915 --> 28:08.985
Oh, he must have planned it,
something, anything.

28:11.722 --> 28:13.922
Uh...

28:13.924 --> 28:16.359
A steering bolt!

28:21.764 --> 28:25.933
I knew it. Now I got ya!

28:25.935 --> 28:29.603
Some genius.

28:29.605 --> 28:31.941
Oops. Shh, quiet.

28:33.475 --> 28:35.541
Ho-ho-ho.

28:35.543 --> 28:38.779
Hey, a surprise visit?

28:38.781 --> 28:41.749
Or are you spying on me?

28:41.751 --> 28:43.850
Where did he come from?

28:43.852 --> 28:46.487
Oh, that was
really unusual.

28:46.489 --> 28:49.056
Fran, Zac's on the move.
Didn't you hear?

28:49.058 --> 28:51.892
But these birds.

28:51.894 --> 28:54.064
They're so interesting?

28:55.531 --> 28:58.965
Uh, you cheated!

28:58.967 --> 29:01.635
You're just saying that
'cause you lost.

29:01.637 --> 29:03.604
No.

29:03.606 --> 29:05.939
I'm saying it because you did.

29:05.941 --> 29:08.442
And I have proof.

29:08.444 --> 29:10.442
Investigated.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.577
I, we... well, I,
uh, it's, um...

29:12.579 --> 29:14.079
- Oh, there it is.
- That's it, Frankie.

29:14.081 --> 29:16.548
- You don't back down!
- You the man, Frank!

29:16.550 --> 29:18.518
- Yeah.
- You the man, Frank!

29:18.520 --> 29:21.854
Okay. You got me.
You're right.

29:21.856 --> 29:24.790
- And I regret it.
- You do?

29:24.792 --> 29:27.192
My sled's better,
my driver's better,

29:27.194 --> 29:28.861
and I'm just plain better.

29:28.863 --> 29:31.631
Ask your friends.
They were there.

29:31.633 --> 29:34.433
That guy's not gonna make
many friends with that attitude.

29:34.435 --> 29:36.635
I don't think
he wants friends, Chuck.

29:36.637 --> 29:38.671
I think he wants a bop
on the nose.

29:38.673 --> 29:43.041
- Then I demand a rematch!
- Great idea.

29:43.043 --> 29:47.447
Because cheaters have to be put
in their place and...

29:47.449 --> 29:50.816
- Wait a minute, what?
- Yeah, a rematch.

29:50.818 --> 29:54.753
Only this time on a real track.

29:54.755 --> 30:00.124
You're right. A racetrack
that really tests our abilities.

30:00.126 --> 30:02.093
It will have banked curves.

30:02.095 --> 30:05.029
- A high speed straightaway.
- A big jump!

30:05.031 --> 30:08.834
And... and... and a way
to take sleds back uphill

30:08.836 --> 30:13.104
so they can race downhill again!

30:13.106 --> 30:16.173
- Oh, this is getting good.
- Are they friends now?

30:16.175 --> 30:19.009
Ooh, and then... then... then
a loop!

30:19.011 --> 30:20.911
A fantastic loop

30:20.913 --> 30:24.181
unlike any loop
that's come before!

30:24.183 --> 30:27.786
I can't wait to get started!
Hand me my drafting pencil.

30:27.788 --> 30:31.056
Uh, no.

30:31.058 --> 30:32.857
Don't think so.

30:32.859 --> 30:37.027
You're a cheater
and we don't need you.

30:37.029 --> 30:38.165
Huh?

30:41.635 --> 30:43.168
Fine.

30:43.170 --> 30:47.604
If it's war you want,
it's war you'll get.

30:47.606 --> 30:50.940
No, no, no, no.
We don't want war.

30:50.942 --> 30:53.110
Trust me, we want a race.

30:53.112 --> 30:55.078
A fair race.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.248
And while you're building
a world-class track,

30:58.250 --> 31:00.183
I'll build a better sled.

31:00.185 --> 31:02.987
A super sled.

31:02.989 --> 31:06.524
Can you even repair
your sled in time?

31:06.526 --> 31:09.959
Yeah, you bet I can.

31:09.961 --> 31:14.030
I have friends to help me.
Mm-hmm.

31:14.032 --> 31:16.734
The door's right there.
Please leave.

31:16.736 --> 31:21.007
No, thank you.
I'll go out the way I came in.

31:26.979 --> 31:28.882
Whoa!

31:32.151 --> 31:36.986
Can you guys
give me a hand, please?

31:38.957 --> 31:41.224
Hold on, Fran!

31:41.226 --> 31:43.125
We'll leave your teeth,
I promise.

31:50.669 --> 31:53.538
Oh, well this should be easy.

32:00.077 --> 32:02.178
If your owner doesn't show up,

32:02.180 --> 32:04.846
you can stay here forever.

32:04.848 --> 32:07.083
A dog mansion.

32:07.085 --> 32:08.953
Whoa, lucky puppy.

32:10.322 --> 32:11.690
Lucky me.

32:14.191 --> 32:16.124
Yeah! Alright!

32:16.126 --> 32:17.794
- Yeah!
- Woohoo!

32:17.796 --> 32:19.861
Come on, puppy!

32:23.167 --> 32:25.833
Guys, what's going on?

32:25.835 --> 32:27.602
We're gonna have another race!

32:27.604 --> 32:28.937
- Alright!
- Alright!

32:28.939 --> 32:31.042
That's awesome! Woohoo!

32:36.814 --> 32:40.681
So, you see, it wasn't the sled
or the driver.

32:40.683 --> 32:42.950
It was that Zac cheated.

32:42.952 --> 32:46.690
Still, Frankie was totally
out of line.

32:47.291 --> 32:49.791
Yeah!

32:49.793 --> 32:51.392
- Whoa!
- Hey, people!

32:51.394 --> 32:53.797
I'm trying to work, okay?

32:56.834 --> 32:58.166
Huh?

33:02.773 --> 33:05.207
Quiet!

33:05.209 --> 33:08.043
- We're quiet.
- This is serious.

33:08.045 --> 33:10.711
I gotta work
and you're distracting me.

33:10.713 --> 33:13.813
Go home and rest. We'll meet up
again in the morning.

33:13.815 --> 33:15.815
- Okay, Frankie.
- Okay, guys. Come on, puppy.

33:15.817 --> 33:17.752
- Try not to work yourself...
- Hmph.

33:17.754 --> 33:21.121
Sophie. Oh, you're here.

33:21.123 --> 33:22.223
Yeah.

33:22.225 --> 33:24.190
Look, I'm really sorry

33:24.192 --> 33:26.327
I said you're a bad driver.

33:26.329 --> 33:29.796
You're not. I know you're not.

33:29.798 --> 33:34.968
And I'm sorry
I said you had a crummy sled.

33:34.970 --> 33:38.839
This Zac character's
a real cheater.

33:38.841 --> 33:41.942
- Look what he did to us.
- I know.

33:41.944 --> 33:45.446
So what are we gonna do to him?

33:45.448 --> 33:48.314
We? As in you and me?

33:48.316 --> 33:52.419
Well, you need a driver,
don't you?

33:52.421 --> 33:56.322
- You mean it?
- Yeah. Let's crush this guy.

34:02.330 --> 34:04.299
Come here, little guy.

34:11.205 --> 34:13.105
Calm returns.

34:13.107 --> 34:17.013
My incomparable brain
is tranquil and quiet.

34:19.947 --> 34:21.350

waiting for the train?

it doesn't come through today?

35:55.974 --> 35:57.978
Hey.

35:59.411 --> 36:02.815

- My parents.

36:03.849 --> 36:05.550
- I see.
- Hm.

36:05.552 --> 36:08.155
You know, the train

36:11.924 --> 36:13.926

36:16.128 --> 36:17.797

36:23.234 --> 36:26.435
I understand
what it's like to be lonely.

36:26.437 --> 36:29.471
I'm not lonely. I'm alone.

36:29.473 --> 36:31.109
There's a difference.

36:45.156 --> 36:46.522
I can't look.

36:46.524 --> 36:49.359
- Did anybody take a number yet?
- Oh.

36:49.361 --> 36:52.328
Relax. Not a one.

36:55.434 --> 36:57.901
- Whoa, dog.
- Good puppy.

36:57.903 --> 37:00.203
Why don't you just give him
a real name?

37:00.205 --> 37:01.504
Do you need a name, puppy?

37:05.410 --> 37:08.511
No. He's not my dog.

37:08.513 --> 37:11.412
Somebody lost him,
somebody who gave him a name

37:11.414 --> 37:14.215
and really misses him.

37:18.088 --> 37:20.054

37:53.991 --> 37:55.423

37:55.425 --> 37:58.192

living in that hay!

37:58.194 --> 38:00.194
Voles?

38:00.196 --> 38:03.196
Wouldn't wanna disturb them.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.165

Aww. You wanna play fetch.

than I imagined.

40:59.773 --> 41:01.673

all that recycled junk though.

outside the box.

41:08.747 --> 41:10.750

Oh. Oh, hey, Chuck.

41:14.886 --> 41:17.121
Hi, Charlie.

41:17.123 --> 41:19.857
So pretty busy?

41:19.859 --> 41:21.724
Nah. Just finished.

41:21.726 --> 41:24.627
- Y... you?
- Oh, busy, busy, busy.

41:24.629 --> 41:27.297
You know,
there's this race coming up.

41:27.299 --> 41:31.534
Yeah, I heard.
'Cause your cousin, he cheated.

41:31.536 --> 41:34.270
- Yeah, about that...
- That's okay.

41:34.272 --> 41:37.373
I told everyone
you had nothing to do with it.

41:37.375 --> 41:39.611
- Because you're really nice.
- Huh?

41:42.714 --> 41:45.549
There you are. Have you been
a good little puppy?

41:45.551 --> 41:47.484
Have you?

41:47.486 --> 41:50.753
Uh, maybe not so good.

41:50.755 --> 41:53.857
Great loop.
Did you build it?

41:53.859 --> 41:56.192
Yeah. Me and my buddies.

41:56.194 --> 41:57.894
Real solid too.

41:57.896 --> 42:00.162
Oh-oh.

42:00.164 --> 42:01.666
What?

42:03.200 --> 42:04.267
- Come on!
- Aah!

42:13.343 --> 42:16.711
What did you do?

42:16.713 --> 42:20.383
Me? I didn't do anything.
I just got here.

42:20.385 --> 42:23.919
Well, then I guess
you're cursed.

42:23.921 --> 42:26.321
You know what? Forget it.

42:26.323 --> 42:29.492
- I don't even want a rematch.
- W... what?

42:29.494 --> 42:32.794
No way! I have to win!

42:32.796 --> 42:36.499
Well...

42:36.501 --> 42:41.803
I suppose we could make
the race more interesting.

42:41.805 --> 42:45.574
- What do you mean?
- Make it worth something.

42:45.576 --> 42:48.677
- Like what?
- The barn.

42:48.679 --> 42:51.913
Whoever wins gets the barn.

42:51.915 --> 42:55.349
Ha! Forget about it.
It's not mine to give.

42:55.351 --> 42:58.520
It's... everyone's.

42:58.522 --> 43:02.891
Well, I guess that's that then.
Go tell everyone you're a loser.

43:02.893 --> 43:04.692
Wait, hold it! Hold it!

43:05.795 --> 43:08.596
Uh, okay.

43:08.598 --> 43:10.297
For the barn.

43:10.299 --> 43:13.835
It won't matter, anyway,
because I'm not going to lose.

43:13.837 --> 43:15.936
Shake on it?

43:15.938 --> 43:20.775
I was thinking of something
a little more official.

43:20.777 --> 43:23.011
So I wrote a contract
in everyone's names.

43:23.013 --> 43:25.248
You can sign
for them, right?

43:26.415 --> 43:28.919
Uh, yeah, sure.

43:32.255 --> 43:34.921
Thank you.

43:34.923 --> 43:36.689
- What happened?
- I don't know.

43:36.691 --> 43:38.758
- Oh, no, not the loop!
- Is everyone okay?

43:38.760 --> 43:41.461
Oh, did anyone
get crushed?

43:41.463 --> 43:44.964
I think I'm kind of to blame
for this.

43:44.966 --> 43:47.568
Ah, there you are, dog.

43:47.570 --> 43:49.703
I thought you were lost.

43:49.705 --> 43:52.805
Wait, that's Piers' dog.

43:52.807 --> 43:55.408
No, it's mine.

43:55.410 --> 43:58.747
My parents gave it to me,
but it keeps running away.

43:59.948 --> 44:01.915
What? Oh.

44:22.603 --> 44:24.771
So that's nine times...

44:24.773 --> 44:26.905
- Hey, Frankie.
- Piers.

44:26.907 --> 44:28.874
Equals...

44:28.876 --> 44:31.043
What you doin'?

44:31.045 --> 44:32.512
Everything.

44:32.514 --> 44:33.980
Double up the pegs
for the guy-wires

44:33.982 --> 44:35.981
and increase the tension 10%.

44:35.983 --> 44:38.050
Oh.

44:38.052 --> 44:42.855
My new loop is designed
to withstand an asteroid crash.

44:42.857 --> 44:45.757
Unless it's holding a chainsaw.

44:45.759 --> 44:49.728
Hey, you and Zac seem to be on
pretty good speaking terms now.

44:49.730 --> 44:52.097
Mm-hm, hm, you're right.

44:52.099 --> 44:54.467
Ah, no, we're enemies.

44:54.469 --> 44:57.469
I'm gonna need a bigger hammer.

44:57.471 --> 45:00.072
Chuck, get Lucy a sledge hammer.

45:00.074 --> 45:02.507
So maybe you could talk to him.

45:05.012 --> 45:07.914
Oh!

45:07.916 --> 45:10.948
I mean, you saw. Puppy doesn't
really wanna be with him.

45:10.950 --> 45:12.783
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

45:12.785 --> 45:14.986
- Frankie!
- Argh, Piers.

45:14.988 --> 45:17.089
I'm a little busy right now.

45:17.091 --> 45:19.957
Maybe after the race.

45:19.959 --> 45:22.026
This is important to me.

45:22.028 --> 45:25.464
Friends are supposed to stick
by their friends.

45:25.466 --> 45:27.665
And I will. I will.

45:27.667 --> 45:29.303
After the race.

45:37.377 --> 45:39.444
Zac?

45:39.446 --> 45:40.581
Zac?

45:42.015 --> 45:44.448
- Are you here?
- Huh?

45:44.450 --> 45:45.783
Zac?

45:45.785 --> 45:48.486
Are you in there?
I need to talk to you.

45:48.488 --> 45:50.756
You guys spying on me again?

45:50.758 --> 45:52.890
Me? You're kidding?

45:52.892 --> 45:54.826
I'm dead serious.

45:54.828 --> 45:57.595
- Get out of here.
- No.

45:57.597 --> 46:01.030
I came to tell you that it's not
hard to make your dog happy.

46:01.032 --> 46:03.833
You know, so he doesn't
keep running away.

46:03.835 --> 46:06.070
Sure, you did, spy.

46:06.072 --> 46:08.005
- Now I'm busy.
- Great.

46:08.007 --> 46:10.039
If you're busy, let me walk
your dog. I could train him.

46:10.041 --> 46:12.409
Ah, goodbye.

46:12.411 --> 46:14.013
Hm.

46:16.916 --> 46:20.450
By the way, Frankie has
a bigger sled than yours.

46:20.452 --> 46:23.854
Way bigger. Hmph.

46:23.856 --> 46:26.824
It's a good idea. Why don't you
just let him train the dog?

46:26.826 --> 46:30.161
A good idea is for someone,
meaning you,

46:30.163 --> 46:34.465
to find out about their sled.
Now!

46:36.936 --> 46:40.470
Frankie, you're gonna need
a bigger sled!

46:40.472 --> 46:42.139
- Way bigger!
- Huh.

46:42.141 --> 46:43.941
And I'm not even jokin'.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.806
Hey, Chuck.

47:16.808 --> 47:19.741
Uh, ho-ho! You know, Charlie,

47:19.743 --> 47:22.846
you sing
like an angel.

47:22.848 --> 47:24.717
Oh, don't say that.

47:27.486 --> 47:29.185
So what you working on?

47:29.187 --> 47:31.020
Ho, ho, oh, it's our new sled.

47:31.022 --> 47:32.955
It's real fast.

47:32.957 --> 47:35.823
- Those the plans?
- Yeah.

47:35.825 --> 47:38.126
I thought I'd get
some souvenir pictures

47:38.128 --> 47:40.128
of you at work.

47:40.130 --> 47:42.834
Really? Okay. Great.

47:45.568 --> 47:47.503
Okay, I'm ready. Wait!

47:47.505 --> 47:49.238
H... how's that?
Oh, hey, this...

47:49.240 --> 47:51.874
Oh, here. I'll pick this up.

47:51.876 --> 47:54.510
Thanks. I guess.

47:54.512 --> 47:56.711
No. Thank you.

47:56.713 --> 48:00.648
Well,
see ya later, Chuck.

48:00.650 --> 48:04.586
No. See you later.

48:04.588 --> 48:08.092
Oh, and I'll autograph those
pictures for you if you want.

48:12.229 --> 48:15.197
These are useless!

48:15.199 --> 48:17.798
You're not much
of a photographer.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.934
I never said I was.

48:21.103 --> 48:23.170
Hey, drop it!

48:25.607 --> 48:28.543
Oh, gross. Dog drool.

48:28.545 --> 48:29.911
I think you should
let that Piers guy

48:29.913 --> 48:31.645
play with the puppy a bit.

48:31.647 --> 48:35.148
Hmph. I think that's...

48:35.150 --> 48:37.752
Ah, get off that!

48:39.288 --> 48:42.589
Yeah...
Torsion arm dampers, huh?

48:42.591 --> 48:44.558
Well, one picture helps.

48:44.560 --> 48:47.228
- Good work.
- That's too bad.

48:47.230 --> 48:49.996
I thought you said you wanted
to win fair and square.

48:49.998 --> 48:52.900
Actually, I just wanna win.

48:54.203 --> 48:57.737
Ugh, yuck! Stop licking!
Disgusting.

48:57.739 --> 48:58.808
Ugh.

49:00.576 --> 49:03.076
I'll make a few more
modifications tonight...

49:18.026 --> 49:19.028
Uh-oh.

49:20.595 --> 49:22.562
What?

49:22.863 --> 49:24.930
Oh, puppy?

49:24.932 --> 49:28.033
What are you doing here?

49:28.035 --> 49:31.671
Hey, the puppy
definitely needs training.

49:31.673 --> 49:33.872
I thought
maybe you could help us out.

49:33.874 --> 49:35.774
Seriously? I would love to.

49:35.776 --> 49:37.343
No problem.

49:37.345 --> 49:39.678
Hey. Thanks, Charlie.

49:39.680 --> 49:42.615
Get the ball!

49:44.385 --> 49:46.986
Go get it.

49:46.988 --> 49:48.787
Good puppy.

49:48.789 --> 49:50.256
Good boy.
You wanna do it again?

49:50.258 --> 49:52.292
You wanna do it again?

49:52.294 --> 49:53.292
Good boy.

49:55.697 --> 49:56.999
Good boy.

49:59.833 --> 50:02.935
Just... ju...
just give me two minutes.

50:02.937 --> 50:06.137
Okay. Tighten this screw.

50:06.139 --> 50:08.873
All torsion dampers
are good.

50:08.875 --> 50:11.275
- Uh, speedometer...
- Come on, Frankie.

50:11.277 --> 50:15.179
Stop fussing.
Let's put this baby to the test.

50:15.181 --> 50:17.750
Oh, I'm just not sure
it's ready.

50:17.752 --> 50:19.321
It's ready!

50:21.188 --> 50:22.724
Zac!

50:24.090 --> 50:25.824

53:20.429 --> 53:21.998
Thanks.

53:24.434 --> 53:25.999
Whoop!

53:26.001 --> 53:28.336
Oh, what's that?

53:28.338 --> 53:32.574
Ho-ho-ho. Our new top-secret
magic wax.

53:32.576 --> 53:34.374
Frankie says
it gives the sled wings.

53:34.376 --> 53:35.909
That's fine.
I don't need to know.

53:35.911 --> 53:37.445
- He invented it by mixing...
- Shut up.

53:37.447 --> 53:39.213
One part boiled pine sap

53:39.215 --> 53:41.983
with five parts
melted honeycomb and...

53:41.985 --> 53:43.420
- Hmm?
- Muah.

54:03.205 --> 54:05.939
So, what you got for me?

54:05.941 --> 54:08.107
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

54:08.109 --> 54:09.442
How hard can it be

54:09.444 --> 54:12.011
to squeeze a little info
out of that doofus?

54:12.013 --> 54:14.647
Hey, enough.
What do you think this is?

54:14.649 --> 54:16.549
And who do you think I am?

54:16.551 --> 54:18.652
We're so close
to winning this thing,

54:18.654 --> 54:20.286
and you're just gonna
let me lose

54:20.288 --> 54:21.622
to that four-eyed maniac?

54:21.624 --> 54:23.290
I'm done with racing.

54:23.292 --> 54:26.326
I'm gonna concentrate
on my music.

54:26.328 --> 54:29.930
Then maybe I can help
your career.

54:29.932 --> 54:33.433
How?
By spying on the competition?

54:33.435 --> 54:36.136
You're gonna need
a recording studio, right?

54:36.138 --> 54:38.305
Well, I'll design
and build one for you.

54:38.307 --> 54:40.007
Sure.
Where are you gonna put it?

54:40.009 --> 54:42.308
The bathroom or in here?

54:46.079 --> 54:50.115
We'll build your studio
in the barn.

54:50.117 --> 54:52.017
There's plenty of space
for both of us.

54:52.019 --> 54:54.989
All you gotta do is help me win.

55:08.970 --> 55:12.537
Base to Sophie,
the Loop is puppy-proof.

55:12.539 --> 55:14.407
Ready to launch.

55:14.409 --> 55:17.709
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Wow.

55:17.711 --> 55:21.113
- So cool.
- Here we go.

55:21.115 --> 55:23.185
Hey, get away from the sled.

55:25.987 --> 55:27.720
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

55:29.958 --> 55:31.490
Base camp,
we have a problem!

55:31.492 --> 55:32.723
My sled!

55:46.006 --> 55:47.071
Mine!

55:49.241 --> 55:50.741
- That was fun!
- Again!

55:50.743 --> 55:53.678
Ho, ho. Double touch down.

55:55.681 --> 55:57.047
No!

55:58.484 --> 55:59.452
Huh?

56:01.288 --> 56:03.989
Too bad the sled
doesn't really have wings.

56:03.991 --> 56:06.591
- It could fly to the moon.
- Is everyone okay?

56:06.593 --> 56:09.529
Ah, idea.

56:16.402 --> 56:18.406
Come on, time to go home.

56:20.440 --> 56:21.504
Race ya!

56:24.510 --> 56:25.712
Let's go!

56:31.684 --> 56:33.349

56:57.309 --> 57:00.711
He learns fast.
By the way, what's his name?

57:00.713 --> 57:03.113
Uh, Dog.

57:03.115 --> 57:05.048
No.
He's gotta have a real name.

57:05.050 --> 57:08.084
How about Stupid Dog? Better?

57:08.086 --> 57:11.186
- Call him Barky!
- Cotton Tail.

57:11.188 --> 57:13.156
My dog's named Sprinkles.

57:13.158 --> 57:15.791
I know. Smelly.

57:15.793 --> 57:19.194
Attention, everyone.
We're learning to sing.

57:19.196 --> 57:21.764
- Again.
- What's going on here?

57:21.766 --> 57:24.199
They're going to be
my backup singers.

57:24.201 --> 57:27.369
When she opens her
recording studio in the barn.

57:27.371 --> 57:31.174
Really? You're gonna join us
and hang out in the barn?

57:31.176 --> 57:33.108
Oh, no.

57:33.110 --> 57:34.744
Four-eyes didn't tell you?

57:34.746 --> 57:38.214
When he loses the race,
I win the barn.

57:38.216 --> 57:41.583
- And you guys are out!
- What?

57:41.585 --> 57:45.790
♪ Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi ♪♪

57:49.493 --> 57:51.793
- You think it's safe?
- Don't worry about it.

57:51.795 --> 57:54.329
Oh, don't worry.
It's... it's perfectly safe.

57:55.533 --> 57:57.265
How could you?

57:57.267 --> 58:00.267
You have no right
to give away the barn!

58:00.269 --> 58:03.238
The barn is everybody's!

58:03.240 --> 58:05.240
- Hey.
- How did he do that?

58:05.242 --> 58:07.609
Uh, uh, I didn't want to.

58:07.611 --> 58:10.544
Zac made me.

58:10.546 --> 58:12.513
What are you talking about?

58:12.515 --> 58:15.517
What did Zac make you do?

58:17.387 --> 58:19.120
The race...

58:19.122 --> 58:21.622
Z... Zac, he... he... he wanted...

58:21.624 --> 58:24.191
Frankie bet the barn
on the race!

58:24.193 --> 58:27.729
If he loses, we're out.

58:27.731 --> 58:29.363
- You did what?
- Huh?

58:29.365 --> 58:31.365
What's wrong with you?

58:31.367 --> 58:34.602
I... I...
I didn't have any choice.

58:34.604 --> 58:37.171
O... o... otherwise
he wouldn't race.

58:37.173 --> 58:39.441
Uh, there'd be no rematch.

58:39.443 --> 58:42.276
So what?

58:42.278 --> 58:44.178
- This is our place!
- Yeah.

58:44.180 --> 58:45.346
It's our barn,
it's ours!

58:45.348 --> 58:47.480
- Yeah, exactly.
- We all share it.

58:47.482 --> 58:50.884
"And the winner will therefore
the possession of the barn."

58:50.886 --> 58:53.554
This contract checks out.

58:53.556 --> 58:57.590
It's got all our names on it
and it's airtight.

58:57.592 --> 59:01.561
If I don't beat him,
you guys will always wonder

59:01.563 --> 59:05.231
if I'm really the smartest.

59:05.233 --> 59:06.833
Is that what you really
think of us?

59:06.835 --> 59:09.170
But I will win the race

59:09.172 --> 59:11.572
and then none of this
will matter.

59:11.574 --> 59:12.776
You'll see.

59:21.616 --> 59:23.352
- Ugh.
- Huh.

59:35.763 --> 59:39.531
No more pilot, no more friends.

59:39.533 --> 59:44.203
I guess
that means no more race.

59:44.205 --> 59:47.339
You could just give up
the barn now.

59:47.341 --> 59:48.975
Don't answer right away.

59:48.977 --> 59:51.147
Think about it.

01:00:05.526 --> 01:00:07.627
Yeah, that's it.
Go get it, boy.

01:00:07.629 --> 01:00:09.696
- That's it. Come on back.
- You cute little boy.

01:00:11.332 --> 01:00:14.537
- He's so cute.
- Yeah, that's a good boy.

01:00:16.271 --> 01:00:18.307
Dogs make better friends
than people.

01:00:19.607 --> 01:00:21.974
Thanks a lot.

01:00:21.976 --> 01:00:24.476
I didn't mean it that way.

01:00:24.478 --> 01:00:26.344
You know I'm talking
about Frankie.

01:00:26.346 --> 01:00:28.813
- He's so fluffy!
- Yeah.

01:00:31.784 --> 01:00:34.888
But how long can we stay
mad at him?

01:00:37.324 --> 01:00:38.389
I don't know.

01:00:43.596 --> 01:00:44.631
Whoa.

01:00:47.467 --> 01:00:50.434
Hey, stop that!

01:00:50.436 --> 01:00:52.503
Aren't you the one
who always says

01:00:52.505 --> 01:00:54.639
friends have to stick
by each other?

01:01:30.977 --> 01:01:33.678
Ah, what are you doing?

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.816
No! What are you doing?

01:01:38.317 --> 01:01:41.986
- I'm moving.
- No! No, you're not!

01:01:41.988 --> 01:01:46.089
- Yes, I am!
- No! No! No!

01:01:53.466 --> 01:01:55.902
I ruined everything.

01:01:57.469 --> 01:01:58.635
So you're giving up?

01:02:01.005 --> 01:02:03.405
That's not the Frankie Four-eyes
I know.

01:02:03.407 --> 01:02:04.708
He'd never give up.

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:07.644
Guess you never met the real me.

01:02:07.646 --> 01:02:10.347
The one who betrays his friends.

01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:12.715
Yeah, you sure disappointed us.

01:02:12.717 --> 01:02:15.485
You disappointed us a whole lot.

01:02:15.487 --> 01:02:18.088
But friends stick by
each other, right?

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:20.693
So let me know if I can help.

01:02:21.893 --> 01:02:24.126
Wait.

01:02:24.128 --> 01:02:26.364
You're still my friend?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.068
Yes, dummy.

01:02:48.486 --> 01:02:50.422
Huh?

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:00.899
Huh?

01:03:18.582 --> 01:03:20.047
Huh?

01:03:20.049 --> 01:03:21.750
What are you doing here?

01:03:21.752 --> 01:03:25.520
So I thought
about what you said,

01:03:25.522 --> 01:03:29.024
about quitting
before anyone got hurt.

01:03:29.026 --> 01:03:32.094
And you realized I'm right
and you're giving up.

01:03:32.096 --> 01:03:34.595
Au contraire.

01:03:34.597 --> 01:03:36.664
That's French, by the way.

01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:39.133
I propose we race each other.

01:03:39.135 --> 01:03:42.602
You against me? Driving?

01:03:42.604 --> 01:03:45.472
Yeah. One-on-one.

01:03:45.474 --> 01:03:47.744
If you're brave enough.

01:03:48.845 --> 01:03:51.211
Alright. I accept.

01:03:51.213 --> 01:03:53.613
But there is one condition.

01:03:53.615 --> 01:03:55.450
No rules.

01:03:55.452 --> 01:03:59.086
This time, anything goes.

01:03:59.088 --> 01:04:00.720
Agreed.

01:04:00.722 --> 01:04:04.559
Anyway, brains beat cheats
every time.

01:04:04.561 --> 01:04:06.693
- Ugh.
- No need to show me out.

01:04:06.695 --> 01:04:08.863
I know where the window is.

01:04:08.865 --> 01:04:11.499
Oh, bye, cutie wittle puppy.

01:04:11.501 --> 01:04:13.501
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:04:22.176 --> 01:04:25.712
Oh.

01:04:25.714 --> 01:04:28.482
Ah, I'm okay.

01:04:28.484 --> 01:04:29.982
- See, this is good.
- Huh?

01:04:29.984 --> 01:04:32.118
We can win the race
fair and square.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.857
Sure, but a little
insurance policy wouldn't hurt.

01:04:36.859 --> 01:04:40.960
- You're such a cheater.
- Don't play all innocent.

01:04:40.962 --> 01:04:43.529
It seems to me you helped.

01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:45.931
Your hands are as dirty as mine.

01:04:45.933 --> 01:04:48.567
What?

01:04:54.009 --> 01:04:56.877
Okay.

01:04:56.879 --> 01:04:58.677
We all know the deal.

01:04:58.679 --> 01:05:02.181
We've got an inexperienced
driver racing against a kid

01:05:02.183 --> 01:05:04.116
that will do anything to win.

01:05:04.118 --> 01:05:08.088
And if we lose,
we all move out of the barn.

01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:14.093
But we're not gonna let
a couple of cheaters

01:05:14.095 --> 01:05:15.863
drive a wedge between us!

01:05:17.631 --> 01:05:20.999
We have to stick together
to save the barn!

01:05:23.704 --> 01:05:25.236
Let's go!

01:05:25.238 --> 01:05:26.805
Oh, Charlie wouldn't cheat.

01:05:26.807 --> 01:05:30.309
Actually, Chuck, she was spying.

01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:32.577
She wouldn't do that.
I know her.

01:05:32.579 --> 01:05:37.048
I overheard Zac thanking her
for helping him cheat.

01:05:37.050 --> 01:05:38.917
No.

01:05:38.919 --> 01:05:40.818
I know her.

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.122
She wouldn't do that.

01:05:43.124 --> 01:05:45.223
She wouldn't do that.

01:05:45.225 --> 01:05:46.193
Sorry.

01:05:48.162 --> 01:05:49.894
Don't worry.

01:05:49.896 --> 01:05:52.830
Brains beats cheating
every time.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.701
Alright, yeah.

01:07:09.874 --> 01:07:11.643
Let's do this!

01:07:13.745 --> 01:07:14.845
Grrr.

01:07:18.283 --> 01:07:20.651
Slow poke.

01:07:20.653 --> 01:07:22.118
Hey!

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.287
The starting gate
is frozen shut.

01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:26.390
That didn't happen by accident.

01:07:26.392 --> 01:07:28.261
No problemo.

01:07:30.361 --> 01:07:32.795
Yeah!

01:07:32.797 --> 01:07:34.664
And he's off!

01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:35.865
You're five seconds
behind.

01:07:35.867 --> 01:07:37.266
You can still catch him.

01:07:39.804 --> 01:07:42.704
This is Zac's
first time driving,

01:07:42.706 --> 01:07:45.340
but he sure knows
how to hold his position.

01:07:45.342 --> 01:07:46.677
Whoa!

01:07:48.746 --> 01:07:51.215
- Hot on his tail!
- You're catching up, Frankie!

01:07:53.217 --> 01:07:54.186
Bleh!

01:07:58.056 --> 01:08:00.121
A little higher. Get closer.

01:08:00.123 --> 01:08:02.925
Steady, Frankie.
Hairpin turn in three.

01:08:02.927 --> 01:08:03.962
Roger that.

01:08:06.197 --> 01:08:07.933
Two seconds and closing.

01:08:14.439 --> 01:08:15.741
Whoo!

01:08:21.944 --> 01:08:24.247
Whoo! Whoo!

01:08:26.015 --> 01:08:27.716
Huh?

01:08:27.718 --> 01:08:29.082
Argh!

01:08:37.393 --> 01:08:41.060
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

01:08:41.063 --> 01:08:43.198
- Ow! Whoa!
- Whoa.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.866
Whoa. Neck and neck.

01:08:45.868 --> 01:08:49.002
I'd say
Zac has a quarter second lead.

01:08:49.005 --> 01:08:51.337
That's unofficial, of course.

01:08:56.813 --> 01:09:00.147
No fair. Zac is dumping
rocks on the track.

01:09:04.487 --> 01:09:06.854
But Frankie was ready for it.

01:09:06.857 --> 01:09:09.792
Like he said,
brains beat cheats every time.

01:09:13.528 --> 01:09:15.060
Huh?

01:09:15.063 --> 01:09:19.233
Who's the genius now?

01:09:19.234 --> 01:09:22.033
Did you plan for this, genius?

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:25.939
No.

01:09:28.143 --> 01:09:29.944
Whoa! Whoa!

01:09:32.281 --> 01:09:35.180
Genius is as genius does!

01:09:38.153 --> 01:09:40.154
Sophie to Chuck.

01:09:40.156 --> 01:09:42.421
We need a number six swivel arm
at turn nine.

01:09:42.424 --> 01:09:43.393
Do you cop...

01:09:49.165 --> 01:09:50.997
Frankie,
Chuck's not responding.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.832
His walkie must be broken.

01:09:52.834 --> 01:09:54.937
It's not his walkie,
it's his heart.

01:09:57.504 --> 01:09:59.104
Chuck?

01:09:59.106 --> 01:10:00.172
Whoa!

01:10:00.174 --> 01:10:02.207
Guys, I need a pole!

01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:05.180
A... a stick! Anything!

01:10:07.548 --> 01:10:09.217
Got it!

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:18.390
If Frankie doesn't
get that replacement part,

01:10:18.392 --> 01:10:21.394
this race is over.

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:24.063
Chuck!

01:10:32.339 --> 01:10:35.241
Ha-ha!

01:10:35.243 --> 01:10:36.445
I'm okay.

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:40.249
Okay.

01:10:48.055 --> 01:10:49.856
Huh?

01:10:52.191 --> 01:10:53.161
Whoa.

01:10:57.064 --> 01:10:58.396
Hey-hey!

01:11:00.399 --> 01:11:02.433
Do you honestly think
Frankie has a chance?

01:11:02.435 --> 01:11:06.006
- He's way behind.
- I have to hope so.

01:11:08.475 --> 01:11:11.445
Zac is solidly in the lead
as he approaches the Loop.

01:11:24.024 --> 01:11:26.590
Good luck, four-eyes!

01:11:28.028 --> 01:11:29.494
Frankie, the Loop.

01:11:29.496 --> 01:11:32.463
Zac's done something.
It's falling apart.

01:11:32.465 --> 01:11:34.201
You'll never make it!

01:11:35.367 --> 01:11:38.201
Can't stop now. Literally.

01:11:38.203 --> 01:11:40.036
The breaks are broken!

01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:48.945
Whoa!

01:11:48.947 --> 01:11:50.213
- Oh!
- Huh!

01:12:00.126 --> 01:12:01.959
Huh? Huh?

01:12:04.296 --> 01:12:08.499
Airborne! Yes!

01:12:12.371 --> 01:12:16.009
Who knew a sled could fly?

01:12:20.312 --> 01:12:21.377
Huh?

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:22.348
Huh?

01:12:23.415 --> 01:12:26.349
- Yeah!
- No!

01:12:33.223 --> 01:12:35.593
Yeah!

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:40.031
Oh!

01:12:41.332 --> 01:12:43.535
Ha!

01:12:44.201 --> 01:12:45.301
Huh?

01:12:48.005 --> 01:12:50.605
Hey, where is she?

01:12:50.607 --> 01:12:53.309
Charlie, you're supposed
to roll me up the hill!

01:12:53.311 --> 01:12:57.049
Get over here or you can kiss
your recording studio goodbye!

01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:00.416
Hey, squirts!

01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:02.084
Help me out
and start cranking!

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:04.453
Go, go, go!

01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:08.258
What? Where's Chuck?

01:13:10.393 --> 01:13:13.260
There's no trophy
for second place, you know.

01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:16.732
Hello? Where's Chuck?

01:13:16.734 --> 01:13:18.567
I don't know.
Lucy's looking for him.

01:13:18.569 --> 01:13:21.403
- What?
- Charlie, you're ruining it.

01:13:21.405 --> 01:13:23.505
Where are you?

01:13:26.677 --> 01:13:28.376
Chuck!

01:13:28.378 --> 01:13:30.213
Chuck!

01:13:31.147 --> 01:13:34.082
Chuck!

01:13:34.084 --> 01:13:35.684
Chuck!

01:13:35.686 --> 01:13:38.420
What are you doing?

01:13:38.422 --> 01:13:41.256
There's this race
you've probably heard about.

01:13:41.258 --> 01:13:42.657
Okay.

01:13:42.659 --> 01:13:45.460
I don't feel like
doing anything.

01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:48.029
Oh, come on, you big baby.

01:13:50.366 --> 01:13:51.766
It's my heart.

01:13:51.768 --> 01:13:55.736
Listen,
I'm only gonna say this once.

01:13:55.738 --> 01:13:59.673
You have the biggest,
strongest heart I know

01:13:59.675 --> 01:14:01.776
and Charlie doesn't deserve it.

01:14:01.778 --> 01:14:03.443
I think she does.

01:14:06.449 --> 01:14:08.549
If I ever fall in love...

01:14:08.551 --> 01:14:10.687
somebody kill me.

01:14:20.262 --> 01:14:22.662
There you are.
Where have you been?

01:14:22.664 --> 01:14:23.798
Look!

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.267
- Charlie!!
- Charlie!

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:29.402
Uh, you go girl!

01:14:29.404 --> 01:14:32.238
Wha... wh... what...
what are you doing?

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.573
Wh... what?

01:14:37.113 --> 01:14:40.147
- Huh!
- Crank faster, small fries!

01:14:42.118 --> 01:14:43.816
Ah.

01:14:43.818 --> 01:14:46.352
Well, I don't know
about this love story,

01:14:46.354 --> 01:14:48.521
but we could use the help.

01:14:48.523 --> 01:14:51.558
Don't just stand there,
bunkhead!

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.593
Alright!

01:14:56.598 --> 01:14:59.766
- Whoa!
- He's gaining on me!

01:14:59.768 --> 01:15:01.767
Come on, Frank!

01:15:01.769 --> 01:15:03.669
Ah, traitor!

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:11.177
- Bye-bye.
- Ugh!

01:15:23.658 --> 01:15:25.424
Hurray!

01:15:30.297 --> 01:15:35.667
And now
we say goodbye, loser!

01:15:39.572 --> 01:15:42.607
Whoo! Yeah.

01:15:42.609 --> 01:15:45.310
Not so fast!

01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:59.357
Whoa!

01:16:13.941 --> 01:16:15.873
I got it!

01:16:29.321 --> 01:16:31.157
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay.

01:16:32.825 --> 01:16:34.891
Yes! Ah.

01:16:34.893 --> 01:16:36.327
- Did Frankie make it?
- Who saw it?

01:16:36.329 --> 01:16:37.595
- Did he make it?
- Who won?

01:16:37.597 --> 01:16:40.530
I did?
Oh, right, I... I did!

01:16:41.934 --> 01:16:44.202
I... I won, right?

01:16:44.204 --> 01:16:46.671
Right?
T... tell me I won, please.

01:16:46.673 --> 01:16:49.539
- Did I win?
- Front page news!

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:53.511
Frankie saves the barn

01:16:53.513 --> 01:16:56.213
literally by the skin
of his teeth!

01:16:58.884 --> 01:17:00.551
He did it!

01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:13.529
Congratulations, Frankie!

01:17:13.531 --> 01:17:15.764
Three cheers for Frankie!

01:17:15.766 --> 01:17:17.567
Hip, hip, hooray!

01:17:17.569 --> 01:17:23.773
And the winner of the
Sixth Annual Sledarator race...

01:17:23.775 --> 01:17:25.942
Frankie!

01:17:33.384 --> 01:17:34.451
Huh?

01:17:34.453 --> 01:17:35.955
Get away from me!

01:17:48.299 --> 01:17:49.765
That was fun.

01:17:49.767 --> 01:17:51.800
But let me tell you.

01:17:51.802 --> 01:17:54.938
Argue about who's smarter,
go ahead.

01:17:54.940 --> 01:18:00.776
But never,
and I mean, never ever ever...

01:18:00.778 --> 01:18:02.277
Ever!

01:18:02.279 --> 01:18:06.314
Choose winning a race over us.

01:18:06.316 --> 01:18:08.549
This.

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:09.920
Sorry.

01:18:11.922 --> 01:18:14.389
But that really was fun.

01:18:14.391 --> 01:18:15.857
- He-heh!
- Yeah!

01:18:18.395 --> 01:18:19.827
Team work!
