WEBVTT

00:09.157 --> 00:12.049
- Yo, what's up?
- Hey, man, how's it goin'?

00:12.650 --> 00:14.483
You're... you're evicting me?

00:14.715 --> 00:16.200
Come on, man. I'm just doing my job.

00:16.225 --> 00:17.425
No one wanted it to go down like this.

00:17.577 --> 00:18.891
Hold on a second, man.

00:18.916 --> 00:20.358
I'm about to get my check, okay?

00:20.383 --> 00:21.803
It's just a little bit late.
Maybe try not being

00:21.827 --> 00:23.363
such a massive tool right now.

00:23.388 --> 00:25.030
I'm not being a tool. Dude, I like you.

00:25.055 --> 00:27.339
- Yeah, well, I hate you.
- Really, you hate me? You mean that?

00:27.364 --> 00:28.922
I got your blinds replaced, all right?

00:28.947 --> 00:31.175
- I had to fight for you.
- Oh, my blinds?

00:31.200 --> 00:33.233
Wow. Then I owe you a thank-you.

00:33.258 --> 00:35.124
Thank you very much. Come on, man.

00:35.246 --> 00:37.349
You know something, I got
your brother backstage passes

00:37.374 --> 00:38.917
to every single one of my shows.

00:38.942 --> 00:40.785
Did he ever tell you how
he hooked up with Paula Abdul?

00:40.837 --> 00:42.212
- Who do you think made the intro?
- I mean,

00:42.237 --> 00:43.949
I don't know what to tell you.
That was 15 years ago.

00:43.974 --> 00:45.445
Today he's making me
tape this on your door.

00:45.470 --> 00:47.732
Oh, okay, so you're just
your brother's bitch.

00:47.792 --> 00:49.302
And you just sit around all day hoping

00:49.327 --> 00:51.359
your bandmates will take
you back, but they won't, 'cause...

00:51.383 --> 00:53.646
- 'cause you're a bitch, bitch.
- Yeah?

00:54.205 --> 00:56.439
- Oh, my... ow!
- You just got chopped, bitch.

00:56.734 --> 00:59.064
You say that again, I'm gonna
chop that little dick off.

00:59.123 --> 01:00.393
My dick is normal size.

01:00.418 --> 01:01.825
Oh, yeah, right.

01:01.893 --> 01:03.552
Maybe for an eight-year-old.

01:05.223 --> 01:07.423
Hey, man, that's my mailbox.

01:07.479 --> 01:09.279
That was customized.

01:09.374 --> 01:11.861
It's gonna come out of
your deposit anyway, dude.

01:12.015 --> 01:14.035
You know that stuff just
makes everything look cheap...

01:14.060 --> 01:15.788
You musicians with your devil horns

01:15.813 --> 01:17.175
and your flames and stuff.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.254
That hasn't been badass since the '70s.

01:19.416 --> 01:20.869
Makes everything look uglier.

01:20.894 --> 01:22.182
Tell everyone at Guitar Center

01:22.207 --> 01:23.576
to run from their design instincts.

01:23.601 --> 01:26.435
All your friends... tacky idiots.

01:27.865 --> 01:29.439
Hi. My name is Esther,

01:29.464 --> 01:32.925
and I am here to audition
for the role of waitress

01:33.003 --> 01:36.440
with pep in her step
and a twinkle in her eye.

01:37.033 --> 01:39.166
Uh... what are you...

01:41.952 --> 01:45.084
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.337 --> 02:00.857
I'm sorry.

02:01.365 --> 02:03.865
Nope, leave it, leave it. Just...

02:04.007 --> 02:05.680
- Sorry.
- No, you're fine.

02:05.705 --> 02:07.058
I-I honestly,

02:07.083 --> 02:08.484
I think there was some
kind of misunderstanding,

02:08.508 --> 02:11.374
because we're actually interviewing

02:11.399 --> 02:12.840
for a hostessing job,

02:12.865 --> 02:15.434
so only our waitresses
are permitted to dance.

02:15.459 --> 02:16.625
Okay, um...

02:16.650 --> 02:18.390
You didn't need to do any of that.

02:18.523 --> 02:21.157
Here's the thing.
I eat here all the time.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.528
I love your guys' curly fries.

02:22.553 --> 02:24.453
- They're the best in town.
- Thank you.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.472
I know these routines by heart, okay?

02:26.497 --> 02:27.939
And trust me when I say this.

02:27.964 --> 02:30.369
You are gonna want me dancing out there

02:30.394 --> 02:31.828
on those countertops.

02:31.915 --> 02:34.272
Yeah, see, that's just
not how this works here.

02:34.297 --> 02:36.364
I mean, it takes years for those girls

02:36.389 --> 02:38.804
to work their way
up to waitress. Years.

02:38.829 --> 02:41.988
Well, um, can I... can I understudy,

02:42.013 --> 02:43.694
- or do you guys have, like...
- Thank you so much

02:43.719 --> 02:44.836
for coming in.

02:44.861 --> 02:46.928
Oh, okay. Um...

02:48.673 --> 02:53.277
Can I at least leave you
one of my headshots? Um...

02:53.490 --> 02:55.363
my parents said that
I have to get rid of all of them

02:55.388 --> 02:56.664
before they'll pay for new ones, so...

02:56.688 --> 02:58.655
Yeah, I wouldn't. I just... I don't...

02:59.035 --> 03:01.957
Okay. It's fine.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.916
We'll see you again as a customer.

03:04.941 --> 03:06.458
Do you guys validate?

03:06.678 --> 03:08.178
Parking's free.

03:08.232 --> 03:10.932
I think that's for
the hospital across the street.

03:11.075 --> 03:13.542
Yeah, that's, like, $17 an hour.

03:13.711 --> 03:15.302
Do you guys validate for the hospital?

03:15.327 --> 03:16.673
- No. No.
- Okay.

03:16.698 --> 03:18.385
I don't know why we'd do that.

Oh, man.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.657
You go out there, you give it your all,

03:29.682 --> 03:32.449
and they laugh in your face.

03:32.517 --> 03:34.847
- You didn't get the job, huh?
- No.

03:35.059 --> 03:37.266
I feel you, man. I got
karate-chopped at work today.

03:37.369 --> 03:39.436
God, this job market!

03:39.717 --> 03:41.814
- Should we eat our feelings?
- No, we shouldn't.

03:41.887 --> 03:43.638
I mean, yes, of course we should.

03:43.734 --> 03:45.868
Come on, man, what kind
of question is that?

03:47.027 --> 03:49.782
You wouldn't happen to like
a bold but traditional vanilla

03:49.807 --> 03:52.708
with toppings spanning from
crunchy to wet, would you?

03:52.850 --> 03:54.082
Who, me?

03:54.165 --> 03:57.490
Oh, God, it's my brother.

03:58.077 --> 04:00.404
Hey, Dean, what's up?
Just wrapping up for the day.

04:00.429 --> 04:03.230
<i> Yeah, not anymore. Eduardo's sick,</i>

04:03.255 --> 04:05.347
<i>so you gotta handle
the building on Sweetzer.</i>

04:05.400 --> 04:07.866
<i>Uhh, don't forget, the
old lady died, so...</i>

04:07.891 --> 04:09.690
<i>you also gotta catalog
all of her stuff.</i>

04:09.715 --> 04:11.415
<i>It's gonna be super gross, and,</i>

04:11.440 --> 04:12.651
<i>it'll probably be very sad.</i>

04:12.676 --> 04:14.202
Why can't her family do it?

04:14.227 --> 04:15.994
<i>She had no family.
It's all going to Goodwill.</i>

04:16.019 --> 04:17.156
<i>So pathetic, honestly.</i>

04:17.182 --> 04:19.529
Dude, I'm just stretched
really thin right now.

04:19.584 --> 04:21.942
<i>I haven't been so pleased
with your work ethic lately.</i>

04:21.966 --> 04:23.437
<i>Step it up, or I'm gonna make</i>

04:23.462 --> 04:25.034
<i>you sleep in the yard again.</i>

04:34.598 --> 04:35.864
It's for parking.

04:35.893 --> 04:37.560
Sure.

04:38.174 --> 04:41.409
Benji, perfect match.

04:55.975 --> 04:58.359
Yeah. Yeah, dance in that trash water.

05:01.144 --> 05:03.075
Okay, one more stop, and then...

05:03.100 --> 05:04.692
Ice cream.

05:04.848 --> 05:08.059
No. Then we gotta inventory
the old lady's stuff.

05:09.119 --> 05:11.058
She lived there for, like, 50 years,

05:11.083 --> 05:12.718
and nobody ever saw her.

05:12.797 --> 05:14.397
Whoa. Okay, and I don't

05:14.422 --> 05:15.849
wanna keep bringing this up, but, like,

05:15.874 --> 05:17.931
then we'll go get ice cream?

05:22.802 --> 05:27.269
Oh, ho, Baby Benji, Baby Benji, waah.

05:27.444 --> 05:30.908
Who's this, your sister,
your baby, your baby sister?

05:30.995 --> 05:33.620
Pauly, this is Esther. Esther, Pauly.

05:33.704 --> 05:35.420
Hi. I'm Esther.

05:35.493 --> 05:37.208
So you want me to get you the stuff?

05:37.233 --> 05:38.870
Oh, yeah, strongest stuff you got,

05:38.895 --> 05:40.200
like NBA-grade level.

05:40.225 --> 05:41.781
I got karate chopped today at work.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.275
Oh, poor Baby Benji.

05:44.342 --> 05:47.090
Been gettin' worked over by his
brother with the long hair.

05:47.136 --> 05:48.576
Oooh!

05:48.635 --> 05:51.469
Oh, look, it's Baby Butterz,
Baby Butterz.

05:54.732 --> 05:56.947
What is going on?

05:57.035 --> 05:59.936
- Isn't he awesome?
- I don't understand.

05:59.961 --> 06:03.569
I thought your family had a
zero-tolerance policy for animals.

06:03.707 --> 06:07.031
The tattle potential right
here is off the charts.

06:07.056 --> 06:08.390
I'm not gonna tattle on him.

06:08.415 --> 06:10.730
He's the only tenant in this
building who doesn't bother me

06:10.755 --> 06:13.456
all the time with nonsense
complaints, so I'm chill with him.

06:14.171 --> 06:16.846
Yeah, he's super chill with me, babe.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.294
He gets free weed from his fans,

06:18.319 --> 06:19.429
he doesn't even smoke it.

06:19.454 --> 06:21.244
Wait, you don't smoke?

06:21.365 --> 06:23.177
Zero. The reason why I'm like this

06:23.202 --> 06:24.702
is because my mom, she
smoked a lot of weed

06:24.727 --> 06:25.991
when she was pregnant with me.

06:26.016 --> 06:27.389
When her water broke,

06:27.414 --> 06:29.230
bong water pretty much
dripped out of her.

06:29.387 --> 06:31.924
I was the first baby born
with the munchies, bro.

06:31.949 --> 06:33.982
Ohh!

06:34.859 --> 06:36.326
If you guys are gonna do drugs,

06:36.351 --> 06:37.484
I'm gonna step outside,

06:37.509 --> 06:39.958
just 'cause, like,
I have asthma and vertigo

06:39.983 --> 06:41.667
and stress-induced shingles, and...

06:41.699 --> 06:43.696
I signed an oath in ninth
grade that I wouldn't be involved

06:43.721 --> 06:46.141
in this kind of behavior,
so I'm gonna stick to it.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.237
I mean, okay.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.082
Why don't you just
go to the old lady's apartment

06:50.107 --> 06:51.526
and take inventory of her stuff?

06:51.563 --> 06:53.628
By myself? What if there's a ghost?

06:53.653 --> 06:54.952
I don't know. Befriend it

06:54.977 --> 06:56.441
and write a sequel to <i>Ghost Dad,</i> dude.

06:56.466 --> 06:58.077
I haven't seen the first one.

06:58.102 --> 06:59.216
You don't have to.

06:59.241 --> 07:01.108
It was very nice
to meet you, Mr. Pauly.

07:01.133 --> 07:02.299
I wish you all the luck.

07:02.324 --> 07:04.114
I'll be there in ten minutes.

07:06.171 --> 07:08.134
All right, I'm just playing.
Come back here anytime.

07:08.159 --> 07:09.837
- Okay, nice to meet you.
- But I like you,

07:09.862 --> 07:12.189
I like you, I like you!

07:13.751 --> 07:16.029
So what's her story, man? She's wild.

07:16.139 --> 07:18.469
She's kind of upset, 'cause
she went to interview

07:18.494 --> 07:20.408
for her dream job, and
she didn't get it.

07:20.678 --> 07:22.262
You know, that's the problem
with you millennials.

07:22.287 --> 07:23.823
You work too hard.

07:24.382 --> 07:27.023
You should just retire like SBW.

07:27.444 --> 07:28.631
SBW?

07:28.656 --> 07:30.450
Sweet Baby Wheeze, bro.
You know how it is.

07:30.475 --> 07:32.103
- Oh, wheeze.
- Yeah.

07:34.031 --> 07:35.519
Hello?

07:35.726 --> 07:38.627
Any decomposing corpses?

07:41.266 --> 07:42.756
Oh, my God.

07:53.031 --> 07:54.330
Oh, my God.

08:00.190 --> 08:01.989
Those are my initials.

08:03.797 --> 08:05.910
Dude, you smoked way too much.

08:05.935 --> 08:07.589
You look super stonesy, dude.

08:07.614 --> 08:09.235
No, bro, I'm, like, medium stonesy.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.094
I'm just super allergic to Butterz.

08:11.119 --> 08:13.681
Oh, I gotta go get Esther.

08:13.778 --> 08:16.394
She's been in that old lady's
apartment for, like,

08:17.601 --> 08:19.224
two hours.

08:19.722 --> 08:21.739
She's probably writing
"redrum" on the walls.

08:21.764 --> 08:23.664
All right, I'll see ya.

08:23.689 --> 08:25.817
- Don't let Butterz out.
- I know.

08:25.842 --> 08:27.809
Ah! Oh.

08:27.892 --> 08:31.376
Oh, God, the... the pressure release.

08:41.818 --> 08:43.852
- Dude.
- I found my ice cream.

08:44.154 --> 08:46.608
It tastes just like vanilla
when you eat around the rum,

08:46.691 --> 08:48.590
the raisins, and the freezer burn.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.891
You're welcome.

08:54.936 --> 08:56.490
Stop going through
this dead lady's stuff.

08:56.515 --> 08:57.797
You're gonna get me in trouble.

08:57.822 --> 09:00.439
Come on. You bend the rules for Pauly.

09:00.464 --> 09:02.824
Why can't you
bend them for me, too, okay?

09:02.944 --> 09:04.952
Pauly Shore might get me famous.

09:05.052 --> 09:06.636
You're being delusional, all right?

09:06.885 --> 09:08.958
- You don't even know this woman.
- We have the same initials,

09:08.983 --> 09:10.203
we wear the same size.

09:10.228 --> 09:11.704
You don't understand.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.669
Ethel and I have a special connection.

09:13.743 --> 09:16.644
Okay, look, she has pictures
of her favorite celebrities

09:16.669 --> 09:18.824
up on her wall just like I do.

09:19.010 --> 09:21.110
That right there is Clark Gable,

09:21.186 --> 09:24.487
AKA the Sacha Baron Cohen
of her generation.

09:24.542 --> 09:28.044
Just out of curiosity, what
do you think AKA stands for?

09:28.406 --> 09:30.422
Also kinda alike.

09:30.847 --> 09:32.074
Okay, not bad.

09:32.110 --> 09:35.361
She even organized
her vanity the same way I do,

09:35.386 --> 09:36.719
by stream of consciousness.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.107
I bet if I just reached my hand in...

09:40.939 --> 09:42.404
Oh, my God, gummy bears.

09:42.429 --> 09:44.396
It's like I was meant to be here.

09:44.475 --> 09:47.020
Don't eat those, don't eat those.
Oh, God.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.455
Mmm.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.346
It's gonna take you, like,
20 years to crap those out.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.681
Oh, my God, a top hat... Ah!

09:54.246 --> 09:55.829
I've always wanted to do burlesque,

09:55.854 --> 09:58.690
ever since I saw the "Lady
Marmalade" music video.

09:58.729 --> 10:00.596
As a friend, I'm letting you know

10:00.658 --> 10:03.493
that burlesque is the lowest
form of art possible.

10:03.568 --> 10:06.027
Literally, it's the last
failure a woman can have

10:06.052 --> 10:07.897
is burlesque, after acting, then yoga,

10:07.932 --> 10:09.380
then burlesque. That's it.

10:09.413 --> 10:11.945
Why does everyone keep telling
me the things I can't do?

10:12.057 --> 10:14.187
I might as well just stay here
and live like I'm Ethel

10:14.212 --> 10:15.500
for the rest of my days.

10:15.525 --> 10:17.253
Dude, my allergies are killing me.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.018
It's from that Baby Butterz cat.

10:19.043 --> 10:20.710
I feel like I'm being suffocated

10:20.745 --> 10:22.425
by a super bloom right now.

10:22.483 --> 10:25.042
I'm just like a purebred
Yorkie with my runny eyes.

10:25.074 --> 10:26.786
- It's just terrible.
- Ew.

10:26.811 --> 10:29.299
You do sound like you're
drowning from the inside.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.533
I'm gonna go sit down.
I'm, like, dying right now.

10:33.064 --> 10:35.033
Okay, well, if I know old people,

10:35.058 --> 10:38.359
they've got notions and
potions everywhere you look.

10:39.353 --> 10:40.660
There we go.

10:40.685 --> 10:42.462
You hear that squeaking?

10:42.487 --> 10:44.149
You're gonna hear that
a lot when you're older,

10:44.174 --> 10:46.994
because you treat your body
like it's a Starbucks bathroom.

10:55.914 --> 10:57.980
I feel so nestled. This is great.

10:58.016 --> 11:00.264
It's like I'm in a virgin
beluga's birth canal.

11:00.804 --> 11:02.852
One day, your kids will be sick,

11:03.377 --> 11:05.310
'cause of your genetic make-up.

11:05.335 --> 11:07.410
You're gonna do a great job
taking care of them.

11:07.435 --> 11:09.362
You know, it wouldn't be the
worst thing in the world

11:09.387 --> 11:11.587
if you called to postpone
the Goodwill pick-up.

11:11.823 --> 11:13.689
There's an armoire back there.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.083
I haven't peeked behind it yet,

11:15.108 --> 11:17.782
but my fingers are crossed
for a Narnia situation.

11:17.836 --> 11:19.181
Yeah, I'll just say I made a mistake.

11:19.206 --> 11:20.279
Everyone thinks I'm stupid.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.137
I can get away with anything.
It's awesome.

11:22.334 --> 11:24.234
Yay! Okay.

11:31.389 --> 11:33.456
"Did you email the photos?" Yes.

11:33.498 --> 11:35.919
"Did you fix the microwave?" Yes. Ugh.

11:36.865 --> 11:38.984
I'm only using landlines from now on.

11:39.270 --> 11:41.203
I found lead-based makeup.

11:41.228 --> 11:43.065
They do not make it like this anymore.

11:43.090 --> 11:44.720
It's so amazing.

11:44.769 --> 11:45.993
I'm telling you, Benji,

11:46.018 --> 11:48.126
the universe brought me
here for a reason.

11:48.227 --> 11:50.193
Tell me about it, man. It's so nice

11:50.218 --> 11:51.428
to get away from Dean for a little bit.

11:51.453 --> 11:54.221
- This is great.
- I love it here.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.338
Oh, my God.

11:58.588 --> 12:01.456
These shoes are so normcore.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.579
These are great.

12:03.959 --> 12:05.325
This is support.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.685
Tight hammies no more.

12:06.710 --> 12:08.799
Ethel hoarded two-for-one coupons

12:08.824 --> 12:10.520
to the diner down the street.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.589
We even have the same hobbies.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.794
Eating dinner early is the best.

12:19.052 --> 12:20.689
Especially 'cause
when I eat too late at night,

12:20.714 --> 12:23.648
I get meat sweats and gotta
sleep on a beach towel.

12:23.679 --> 12:25.479
I know. I love this schedule,

12:25.504 --> 12:27.268
and if I stick to it, I could be eating

12:27.293 --> 12:29.694
tomorrow's breakfast
by midnight tonight.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.699
Why does society insist on
making you wait so long

12:32.724 --> 12:33.916
to become an old person?

12:34.025 --> 12:36.102
I know. I feel like
I've always been an old person.

12:36.127 --> 12:37.754
You know, like in junior high,

12:37.779 --> 12:39.017
I was the first one to get ear hair.

12:39.042 --> 12:40.955
Oh, my God, you're so lucky.

12:41.241 --> 12:42.638
Pauly was right.

12:42.673 --> 12:44.807
We gotta start thinking
about early retirement.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.610
Absolutely.
I mean, Ethel had it figured out.

12:47.772 --> 12:51.674
She just sat around all day
collecting cool junk.

12:52.082 --> 12:53.963
Look at these travel-size toiletries.

12:54.208 --> 12:57.025
This little shampoo could
be for a human or a doll.

12:59.633 --> 13:01.060
Oh, yeah, right.

13:01.112 --> 13:03.913
You are going straight to voicemail.

13:08.386 --> 13:10.453
Oh, my God. This may sound crazy,

13:10.478 --> 13:12.787
but I have a legit chance
at the senior tour.

13:12.907 --> 13:14.294
I've been saving my body.

13:14.319 --> 13:15.651
I'm confused.

13:15.907 --> 13:18.221
I'm normally a really
good judge of dead people,

13:18.246 --> 13:19.732
but something's not adding up.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.207
How does a happy recluse end up with

13:22.232 --> 13:25.544
a limited-edition spoon from
every single state capital?

13:25.630 --> 13:26.789
Try reading her diary.

13:26.870 --> 13:28.925
Benji, I'm not gonna read her diary.

13:28.950 --> 13:30.362
That is so invasive.

13:30.387 --> 13:32.282
- You can't find it.
- I can't find it.

13:32.307 --> 13:33.855
I've searched everywhere,
every hiding spot.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.681
It's all gummi bears.
Ethel had a problem...

13:36.905 --> 13:39.008
that I very much relate to
and I'm not judging at all.

13:39.043 --> 13:40.776
Oh, my God, Benji, Benji, Benji.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.450
The diary, it's in the candy drawer.

13:42.475 --> 13:43.813
I gotta go find it.

13:46.851 --> 13:49.122
This is why Tiger
needs a little something extra

13:49.147 --> 13:50.692
to just tune out these distractions.

13:50.768 --> 13:52.567
It's like,
"Hello! I'm in my backswing!"

13:53.144 --> 13:54.329
Oh, my God.

13:54.354 --> 13:56.354
Benji, I was all wrong about Ethel.

13:56.807 --> 13:58.102
Pardon my French,

13:58.127 --> 14:00.273
but she was living <i>la vida loca.</i>

14:00.298 --> 14:02.648
She once spent three days
on a riverboat casino

14:02.673 --> 14:04.499
eating nothing but
lobsters and champagne

14:04.524 --> 14:07.124
before people found out
she wasn't really a magician.

14:07.398 --> 14:09.455
I mean, she was unstoppable.

14:09.487 --> 14:11.687
Nice. Sounds like a real Ronda Rousey.

14:16.346 --> 14:19.020
Yo. - <i> Oh, okay, so now you pick up?</i>

14:19.056 --> 14:20.207
<i>Are you done yet?</i>

14:20.232 --> 14:22.639
No, I'm not done yet, but I am done

14:22.664 --> 14:24.039
helping you do everything,

14:24.064 --> 14:26.345
and I'm done with property
management. Boom!

14:26.410 --> 14:29.377
<i>Sure, you are. Okay. Hey, what's
the status of my crossbow?</i>

14:29.687 --> 14:31.753
I think you have emotional problems.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.757
You know, I recently read this thing

14:33.782 --> 14:35.058
about emotional intelligence,

14:35.083 --> 14:36.330
and I don't think you got it.

14:36.355 --> 14:37.763
Peace out, bro.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.495
- Oh, my God.
- You know what?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.559
I'm gonna cancel that Goodwill
appointment for good.

14:41.651 --> 14:44.552
We can live like this forevah!

14:44.815 --> 14:46.172
I can't.

14:47.081 --> 14:49.292
Ethel wasn't some shut-in, okay?

14:49.333 --> 14:51.617
She was living her life to the fullest.

14:51.642 --> 14:53.026
A week before she died,

14:53.051 --> 14:54.915
she was out running with the Bulls

14:55.019 --> 14:57.019
in Chicago at basketball fantasy camp.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.603
I mean, I don't know what your rush is

14:58.628 --> 14:59.760
to re-enter the real world.

14:59.785 --> 15:01.585
We got a good thing going here, man.

15:01.752 --> 15:04.553
I mean, look at me.
My lower back feels great,

15:04.578 --> 15:05.877
I just got rid of my brother,

15:05.997 --> 15:07.849
I'm peeing laying down, it's great.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.149
Well, I'm done.
Nothing is gonna stop me

15:10.174 --> 15:11.477
from going back to that restaurant

15:11.502 --> 15:14.236
and dancing on tables
for ungrateful tourists.

15:15.167 --> 15:18.645
Man, millennials are just
ruining everyone's retirement.

15:19.089 --> 15:21.229
Ugh, you gotta fix it man.

15:21.276 --> 15:23.163
Just put your hand in there.

15:24.343 --> 15:26.010
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15:27.479 --> 15:29.203
Oh, yeah.

15:29.248 --> 15:31.349
Oh, yeah.

15:31.824 --> 15:34.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:34.833 --> 15:36.181
I can't...

15:36.389 --> 15:38.222
See, that wasn't that bad.

15:38.410 --> 15:40.275
You got to first base.

15:40.593 --> 15:42.345
Stop teasing me. I get chicks.

15:42.461 --> 15:44.358
Yeah, and I got good
reviews on all my films.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.376
Look, I feel gross. I'm gonna
go shower and take a nap.

15:46.485 --> 15:49.288
'Cause that's what retired people do.
We shower, we take naps,

15:49.428 --> 15:51.629
we put some ointment
on our lower backs.

15:52.690 --> 15:55.724
Sit, smoke, shower,
Willie Nelson-style.

15:59.270 --> 16:01.178
Whaa!

16:06.885 --> 16:07.985
Help!

16:08.086 --> 16:09.787
Pauly!

16:34.113 --> 16:36.679
That was good. That was good.

16:36.916 --> 16:38.972
But, um, I told you before,

16:38.997 --> 16:40.964
we aren't hiring waitresses right now.

16:40.989 --> 16:42.324
Well, I was not listening,

16:42.349 --> 16:44.077
and I will not take no for an answer.

16:44.110 --> 16:45.464
I'm sorry, um,

16:45.505 --> 16:47.298
are we gonna have a problem here?

16:47.373 --> 16:49.206
The only problem we are gonna have here

16:49.231 --> 16:51.226
is if you don't hire me,
because I will show up here

16:51.251 --> 16:53.317
every single day, and I
will dance on this desk

16:53.342 --> 16:55.823
in shoes that I may
or may not have stolen

16:55.848 --> 16:57.276
from a dead lady's apartment.

16:57.324 --> 17:00.684
Okay, um, you're not
tall enough to be a hostess.

17:00.717 --> 17:02.343
I don't wanna be a hostess, okay?

17:02.368 --> 17:05.426
I am an entertainer,
and I wanna be out there

17:05.457 --> 17:08.558
pushing tater tots and
dancing in jazz squares.

17:08.867 --> 17:11.404
Okay, well, if you promise
to wear underwear next time,

17:11.563 --> 17:14.531
I can give you Mondays and
Tuesdays, late afternoon shifts.

17:14.646 --> 17:16.848
It's mostly when we're
just marrying the ketchups.

17:16.874 --> 17:18.205
Thank you so much.

17:18.243 --> 17:20.844
I've always wanted
to dance at a wedding.

17:22.548 --> 17:24.348
Somebody help! Help!

17:24.373 --> 17:27.374
Baby Benji?

17:30.416 --> 17:32.303
This is how I die.

17:32.463 --> 17:34.324
In a bathtub like Jim Morrison.

17:34.349 --> 17:35.971
- Baby Benji?
- Pauly!

17:35.996 --> 17:37.564
I'm in here in the bathroom!

17:38.189 --> 17:40.653
Whoa, whoa!

17:40.967 --> 17:42.553
I've been stuck in here for five hours.

17:42.578 --> 17:44.808
I had to eat body wash
with shea butter in it.

17:44.833 --> 17:46.374
That's not the thing
I'm whoa-ing about.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.333
It's your penis.
It's very weird-looking.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.893
It's totally normal. Come on.

17:49.918 --> 17:52.339
Okay, let me help
your little Jewish body.

17:52.464 --> 17:54.284
It's like you're having
another bat mitzvah

17:54.317 --> 17:55.329
Hold on, hold on.

17:55.354 --> 17:57.396
Here, sit here. I saved you though.

17:57.421 --> 17:58.763
You have to admit, when you scream,

17:58.788 --> 18:00.401
- who shows up?
- Thanks, dude.

18:00.426 --> 18:02.217
You're a good guy. You saved my life.

18:02.769 --> 18:04.546
I don't think this retirement
thing is gonna work out, dude.

18:04.571 --> 18:06.337
I probably gotta move
back in with my brother.

18:06.362 --> 18:07.594
No, no, don't move in with him.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.291
I gotta get my old job back, dude.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.118
I just... I hate your brother.

18:11.143 --> 18:13.726
This retirement is just a level
of loneliness I can't handle.

18:13.839 --> 18:15.863
I mean, retirement makes
you soft and squishy.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.522
I forgot to tell you about that.

18:17.597 --> 18:21.093
It's, like, feel my meat.
It's disgusting, right?

18:21.320 --> 18:22.920
You got other things going for you.

18:22.945 --> 18:25.318
- Don't worry about your squishiness.
- Like what?

18:25.978 --> 18:27.410
Exactly. Awkward pause.

18:27.435 --> 18:28.877
I love you, son, I love you, son.

18:28.902 --> 18:31.520
- All right? Take care.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

18:31.545 --> 18:32.873
- Later.
- Later, bud. Thank you.

18:32.898 --> 18:33.997
All right.

18:35.139 --> 18:38.056
I did it. I'm a dancing waitress.

18:38.203 --> 18:41.197
Congrats! You really gotta
have game to work there.

18:41.222 --> 18:42.623
I know, and you know what?

18:42.648 --> 18:44.682
It takes people years
to get to where I am,

18:44.707 --> 18:47.741
and all I had to do was show
that manager that I was serious,

18:47.780 --> 18:49.737
laser-focused,
and that she could never,

18:49.762 --> 18:51.597
ever, ever escape me.

18:51.622 --> 18:52.684
Okay, so you're, like,

18:52.709 --> 18:54.478
the lower-back tattoo of
the service industry.

18:54.503 --> 18:56.111
I'm whatever it takes, dude.

18:56.183 --> 18:57.546
All thanks to Ethel.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.797
Will you say hi to Tupac for me?

19:00.498 --> 19:01.978
Oh, no.

19:02.068 --> 19:04.015
Ethel's stuff. You called the movers?

19:04.184 --> 19:05.502
I mean, it's time.

19:05.571 --> 19:06.695
I can't retire.

19:06.739 --> 19:08.021
I'm young, I'm beautiful,

19:08.046 --> 19:10.046
I have my whole life
ahead of me, you know.

19:10.071 --> 19:12.166
Also, I didn't tell you this,
but I almost died alone

19:12.191 --> 19:14.151
in the bathtub - What?!

19:14.215 --> 19:15.607
Are you okay?

19:15.862 --> 19:17.795
Ah, just tell me later.

19:17.830 --> 19:19.046
Hi there.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.512
Actually, this is mine.

19:20.579 --> 19:23.629
Oh, that's so cute.
So you can remember her.

19:23.682 --> 19:25.448
Yeah, Ethel and I
have a deep connection,

19:25.473 --> 19:27.042
and I know she'd want me to have this.

19:27.067 --> 19:28.483
That reminds me. I'm gonna grab

19:28.508 --> 19:29.891
those vintage sanitary pads.

19:29.916 --> 19:31.268
I mean, why not be the coolest girl

19:31.293 --> 19:33.081
in the Silver Lake gym locker room?

19:33.178 --> 19:35.287
I'm just glad you're working out.

19:38.479 --> 19:40.399
Ah ha ha!

19:40.424 --> 19:42.664
Baby Benji, Baby Benji waah!

19:42.689 --> 19:45.743
Dude! Dude! Dude, look,
you know I love you,

19:45.768 --> 19:47.747
but if you wanna keep living
in my parents' building,

19:47.772 --> 19:49.365
you're gonna have to
get rid of the cat.

19:49.403 --> 19:52.106
Dude, the cat's gone, bro.
I listened to you.

19:52.131 --> 19:55.130
Butterz went spatch.
Sayonara. Super spatch, bro.

19:55.155 --> 19:56.352
- Really?
- Yeah, dude.

19:56.377 --> 19:58.177
Because you had the hay fever, dude.

19:58.202 --> 19:59.962
My punim, I'm trying
to take care of you.

19:59.987 --> 20:01.562
- You're my boy.
- Thanks, bud.

20:01.587 --> 20:03.750
It's cool. You guys have
your own special connection,

20:03.775 --> 20:05.301
kinda like me and Ethel.

20:05.326 --> 20:07.126
We're gonna get some gelato.
You wanna come?

20:07.151 --> 20:09.185
No, I'm staying here
doing some workload.

20:09.210 --> 20:10.668
All right, just around the corner.

20:10.693 --> 20:12.074
- Later, dudes.
- Later.

20:12.114 --> 20:14.824
Bye.

20:16.828 --> 20:19.729
Oh, Baby Butterz.

20:19.764 --> 20:22.798
I would never get rid of my puddycat.

20:22.973 --> 20:24.873
My puddy.
