♪ majestic theme song playing ♪

00:44.211 --> 00:46.588
‐ Whoa. This is...

00:46.588 --> 00:48.674
this is...

00:48.674 --> 00:51.301
I‐I don't know what this is!
A hidden world.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.721
Don't have to ask me twice. Let's go!

00:55.597 --> 00:57.307
Uh, don't worry! Don't worry! No, no, no!

00:57.307 --> 01:00.769
It‐it's just my phone!
It's just my phone. Oh no.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.605
Mom's heading home?
I gotta go.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.827
Yeah. I'm gonna need a lift, pal.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.129
She's leaving work now!
Can you, you know, step on it?

01:27.129 --> 01:29.047
Oh! Whoa!

01:36.680 --> 01:39.641
Oh! Ah!

01:55.616 --> 01:57.910
Oh, man! She's almost home! Hurry!

01:58.660 --> 01:59.870
Look out!

02:03.207 --> 02:04.625
Oh! Okay. Oh!

02:10.297 --> 02:11.840
‐ Tom, I'm home.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.551
‐ Oh. Hey, Mom.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.309
‐ I don't think I'll ever
get used to that hair.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.061
You look like you've been electrocuted.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.605
‐ Okay...

02:36.365 --> 02:38.784
I forgot about the sensors.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.582
You...

02:50.295 --> 02:52.464
Oh... ah!

03:07.813 --> 03:10.774
Looks like a job for Cinnabot538.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.574
‐ Ah!

03:21.785 --> 03:23.662
‐ Sorry, Alex. Didn't mean to scare you.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.914
‐ Sneaking up on people is <i>my</i> thing.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.667
‐ I need some help.
‐ That's abundantly clear.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.378
‐ I have to get past the fence line
without setting off the sensors.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.590
Can Cinnabot538 do some high tech
computer thingy to get me through?

03:34.590 --> 03:36.091
Like you did with the maps?

03:36.091 --> 03:38.135
‐ Maps are one thing, Tom.

03:38.135 --> 03:42.014
Hacking past the security firewall
is a "high tech computer thingy"

03:42.014 --> 03:43.765
that could get me in a lot of trouble!

03:44.766 --> 03:47.978
‐ You're right. I shouldn't even have
asked. I'll figure something else out.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.356
‐ I'll do it.
‐ What, you sure?

03:51.356 --> 03:52.733
I‐I don't want you to get busted.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.443
‐ Just hand me the phone
before I change my mind.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.081
Okay, just tap the cinnamon toast icon.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.834
It'll deactivate the sensors
long enough for you to run past.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.921
‐ Thanks, Alex. Also, uh,
why cinnamon toast?

04:14.463 --> 04:16.924
‐ No reason. Why do you need
to get past the sensors?

04:17.549 --> 04:18.759
‐ No reason.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.054
‐ Guess we both have secrets, don't we?

04:33.899 --> 04:36.401
‐ Thank you, Cinnabot538.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.369
Going somewhere, Kullersen?

04:46.537 --> 04:48.205
‐ Uh...

04:49.623 --> 04:52.292
A‐are you stalking me? That's so sneaky.

04:52.668 --> 04:56.004
‐ I'm sneaky? I think you have
me mixed up with yourself.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.799
Is that where you keep the dragon?

04:58.799 --> 05:01.218
‐ What? Dragon? Come on!

05:01.218 --> 05:04.137
Don't be ridiculous. There is <i>no</i> dragon.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.014
‐ Tom, it's me.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.891
I've known you since
grade school, remember?

05:07.891 --> 05:10.018
I know when you're lying.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.020
There is <i>something</i> in that hole.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.440
‐ Wait, you know when I'm lying?

05:15.440 --> 05:18.652
‐ You put on your charming,
mischievous smile.

05:19.403 --> 05:22.447
Your confident shoulder swag.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.617
‐ Um...
‐ Your smelly armpits!

05:25.617 --> 05:28.370
‐ Smelly armpits? Jun, wait!

05:28.954 --> 05:30.622
‐ Never tell an Aries to wait!

05:33.500 --> 05:35.586
Whoa...

05:42.718 --> 05:45.053
‐ See? There's nothing down here.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.680
‐ Whoa.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.974
What is this place?

05:48.974 --> 05:52.019
‐ Ah, it's just a cave. Seen one,
you've seen them all.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.188
Why don't we just take‐‐

06:03.780 --> 06:05.199
‐ Ah!

06:07.701 --> 06:08.660
Ah!

06:10.662 --> 06:12.080
‐ Kullersen!

06:14.082 --> 06:16.793
‐ Alright, alright, alright! Stop it!
Get off me! Come on.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.670
‐ You're laughing?

06:19.755 --> 06:22.508
That's a...
‐ Sure is.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.302
‐ A <i>real</i> dragon.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.431
I‐I can't believe it.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.935
I mean, of course I believe it.
I've always believed it.

06:32.935 --> 06:35.020
But, now that it's right here,
looking at me...

06:36.021 --> 06:38.023
I can't believe it.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.067
‐ You can touch him if you want.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.194
You're okay if she touches
you, right, pal?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.548
‐ I've been telling anyone
who would listen

07:02.548 --> 07:04.508
for as <i>long</i> as I can remember

07:04.508 --> 07:06.426
that dragons are real,

07:06.426 --> 07:09.763
and I was right!
‐ You were <i>definitely</i> right.

07:09.763 --> 07:13.100
‐ Wait! That means yetis and chupacabras
must be real, too!

07:13.100 --> 07:15.936
‐ Uh, l‐let's not get ahead of ourselves.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.272
‐ What's his name?
‐ I haven't named him yet,

07:18.272 --> 07:20.399
but he does have this lightning thing

07:20.399 --> 07:22.651
that's really amazing.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.194
‐ A lightning dragon?
‐ Yeah.

07:24.194 --> 07:27.781
Yeah, so...
so I thought I'd call him Thunder.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.244
‐ 'Cause Lightning's too on the nose?
‐ Yeah,

07:32.244 --> 07:35.372
I went back and forth.
‐ Aw, do you like the name Thunder?

07:35.372 --> 07:38.000
Do you? Aw.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.213
Oh, I have to get a picture!

07:43.213 --> 07:44.214
‐ Wait, no! No, no, no, no, no!

07:44.214 --> 07:47.676
‐ You don't understand!
My mom <i>has</i> to see this.

07:47.676 --> 07:52.514
‐ She can't.
‐ Tom, she thinks everything I believe
is silly kids stuff.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.266
You don't know how that feels.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.101
She <i>needs</i> to know the truth.

07:56.101 --> 07:59.146
She <i>needs</i> to know her
daughter isn't crazy!

07:59.146 --> 08:01.064
‐ I know, I know, Jun.
Believe me, I get it.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.400
I wanna tell my mom,
too, but we just can't.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.444
It's too dangerous for the dragons.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.738
‐ We can't even trust our own moms?

08:07.738 --> 08:11.074
‐ We can't trust the Rakke Corp,
and both of our moms work for them.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.294
‐ Yeah. Okay. You're right.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.088
‐ Thank you.
‐ You just said <i>dragons</i>.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.632
<i>Plural.</i>

08:26.632 --> 08:29.468
‐ Well, she knows this much, pal.
Should we show her the rest?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.555
Yeah, I think so, too.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.103
Your chart said something
big was gonna happen.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.523
This is pretty big.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.526
‐ Oh. Well, um,

08:45.526 --> 08:47.819
you know, I should really
go through my chart,

08:47.819 --> 08:50.322
make sure it's a safe day
for air travel and everything.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.991
‐ Jun! Jun! It's safe!

09:02.793 --> 09:04.586
Whoa! Whoa! Ah!

09:08.048 --> 09:10.551
Why am I in front!?

09:11.802 --> 09:14.304
‐ Better view!

09:15.889 --> 09:16.974
Whoa!

09:18.600 --> 09:20.644
Oh...

09:20.644 --> 09:22.437
Whoa!

09:23.814 --> 09:25.232
Wow...

09:40.080 --> 09:42.541
‐ Hey. You okay up there?

09:42.541 --> 09:43.792
‐ Mm‐hmm.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.170
I've never seen anything like this.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.213
‐ Just wait till you see
where we're going.

09:51.717 --> 09:55.179
Um, how am I supposed to see
anything with you covering my eyes?

09:55.179 --> 09:58.182
‐ Uh duh duh duh, hold on,
hold on. We're almost there.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.350
Wow.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.727
You never get used to it, do you?

10:01.727 --> 10:04.188
‐ Get used to what?
‐ Oh, sorry.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.777
That's a lot of dragons.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.779
Looks like a whole world of them.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.120
‐ Has this place been here the whole time?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.831
‐ I don't know. I'm guessing
when the fissure was formed,

10:22.831 --> 10:24.583
it opened the door.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.418
It's unbelievable.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.339
‐ Aw. Hello, little guy.

10:31.173 --> 10:34.676
I can't believe
how friendly they are.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.845
I thought all dragons breathed fire

10:36.845 --> 10:39.598
and terrorized villages.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.600
‐ Guess you can't believe
everything you read.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.231
What is it, pal?
‐ Tom, look!

10:57.032 --> 10:58.200
They eat crystals.

10:58.617 --> 10:59.993
That makes sense.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.287
‐ None of this is in
any of my dragon books.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.665
‐ Jun, Jun! Slow down!

11:04.665 --> 11:06.333
Something doesn't feel right.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.753
‐ Look at you guys.
Oh, aren't you beautiful?

11:09.753 --> 11:12.297
Oh hey, it's okay.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.799
I'm Jun.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.553
Oh... Uh...

11:17.970 --> 11:19.888
‐ Thunder, get us outta here!

11:23.392 --> 11:25.310
Jun!

11:25.811 --> 11:27.187
‐ Ah!

11:36.405 --> 11:39.366
‐ We're going down!

11:39.366 --> 11:42.411
‐ Ah, I guess some dragons
do breathe fire.

11:42.411 --> 11:45.247
‐

11:53.755 --> 11:55.507
Oh no.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.759
Jun!

12:05.809 --> 12:09.021
Thunder! Save Jun! Save! Jun!

12:12.024 --> 12:14.151
‐ Thunder!

12:14.151 --> 12:15.527
Ah!

12:25.662 --> 12:27.372
Okay...

12:28.165 --> 12:30.334
That's not good.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.676
It's just a fish.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.097
Another fish.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.824
Whoa...

13:02.824 --> 13:05.577
A two‐headed dragon.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.000
That's trapped in here with me... Ah!

13:41.238 --> 13:43.407
‐

13:43.407 --> 13:45.033
Where's Jun?

13:46.785 --> 13:49.454
Okay, okay. We'll find her together.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.763
I hope whatever that is, it's not Jun.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.353
‐ Will you stop that?

14:18.358 --> 14:22.070
You're the most beautiful
creature I've ever seen,

14:22.821 --> 14:25.782
but stop almost crushing me!
Jun, you down there?

14:26.658 --> 14:30.245
‐ Tom! I'm trapped,
and there's a two‐headed dragon in here!

14:30.245 --> 14:32.789
‐ Two heads? Nice.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.626
Right, pal.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.377
Alright, we'll blast you out.
No, no, no!

14:37.377 --> 14:39.922
That could collapse the ceiling
and crush us both.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.423
Then how do we help?

14:49.014 --> 14:50.724
‐ I don't think you can.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.476
I have to train this dragon.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.981
‐ It doesn't look like it's in the mood.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.817
‐ I don't have much choice! We can't
get outta here without each other,

15:00.817 --> 15:03.904
and if it keeps slamming into the ceiling,
it's going to kill us both.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.199
I didn't just read your chart,
Tom. I read my own,

15:07.199 --> 15:09.451
and I think this is my destiny.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.329
‐ I don't know.
Your destiny looks really angry.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.712
We gotta ditch these guys. We'll be back!

15:21.755 --> 15:24.049
‐ Okay.

15:24.049 --> 15:27.845
My whole life has been
leading up this moment.

15:30.639 --> 15:34.059
Mighty dragon of the crystal pool,

15:34.059 --> 15:36.854
I am Jun Wong!

15:36.854 --> 15:38.814
I command you to come to me!

15:39.898 --> 15:43.151
Together, we will escape this prison!

15:43.819 --> 15:46.113
Hear me and obey!

15:52.202 --> 15:53.829
Uh‐oh.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.625
Whoa!

15:59.334 --> 16:02.462
Okay.
Confidently taking command like a wizard

16:02.462 --> 16:05.674
usually works in the stories.

16:06.717 --> 16:10.095
Think, Jun, think.
What else do dragons like?

16:11.680 --> 16:15.559
Treasure! Behold,
great beast.

16:15.559 --> 16:19.771
My priceless treasure.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.900
Oh! Yes. There we go.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.820
That's it. Now, succumb to me

16:26.820 --> 16:29.198
and become my servant.

16:29.198 --> 16:31.450
I will reward you with‐‐ Hey!

16:31.450 --> 16:34.161
Oh, stop that!

16:34.161 --> 16:36.830
Ah! No! Ugh!

16:38.123 --> 16:40.417
Oh, you're not supposed to eat it!

16:42.377 --> 16:44.338
Oh,

16:44.338 --> 16:46.840
why isn't any of this working!?

16:55.224 --> 16:56.725
‐ We gotta shake these guys, pal!

16:57.851 --> 16:59.311
Wait a second. Why are we running?

17:00.187 --> 17:01.730
You can fly!

17:03.315 --> 17:05.567
Ha! See you later, suckers!

17:10.322 --> 17:12.032
Oh great. They fly, too?

17:12.032 --> 17:13.033
Ah!

17:15.494 --> 17:17.704
Whoa! Whoa!

17:22.084 --> 17:24.294
Okay. I've had about enough of this.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.796
Let's light 'em up!

17:43.772 --> 17:44.982
Yeah!

17:44.982 --> 17:46.608
Eat some lightning!

17:49.903 --> 17:51.822
Man, these guys are tough! Huh?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.454
‐ Put me down! Oh!

17:59.454 --> 18:02.291
I am not a chew toy! Stop!

18:02.291 --> 18:03.458
Whoa!

18:04.668 --> 18:07.337
I am trying to save you!

18:07.337 --> 18:09.798
<i>You</i> need to listen to me!

18:19.683 --> 18:22.811
I was so sure that my chart
was the same as Tom's,

18:22.811 --> 18:25.981
that these dragons were our destiny.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.692
So, why isn't this working?

18:29.818 --> 18:32.863
You even remind me of the mythical stories

18:32.863 --> 18:34.823
my <i>A Po</i> used to tell me.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.619
I'm no dragon trainer, am I?

18:38.619 --> 18:41.413
You have no reason to listen to me.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.290
This isn't my destiny.

18:46.752 --> 18:48.754
Okay, alright. Enough of that.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.214
You have two heads,

18:50.214 --> 18:52.007
I have two hands.

18:55.219 --> 18:58.972
You don't want to be commanded by a wizard
or tricked with treasure,

18:58.972 --> 19:00.557
do you?

19:00.557 --> 19:02.893
You wanna be respected and revered,

19:02.893 --> 19:06.355
just like the dragons
in my <i>A Po's</i> stories. You...

19:06.355 --> 19:08.565
are the moon.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.651
Cool, quiet, and thoughtful.

19:11.235 --> 19:12.528
And you...

19:12.528 --> 19:16.448
are the sun. Hot, fiery, soulful.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.951
Together, you create balance.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.579
I am Jun Wong.

19:22.579 --> 19:25.123
I am humbled by your majesty.

19:25.123 --> 19:28.043
I ask for your acceptance and friendship.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.469
I should've also remembered
my <i>A Po's</i> stories

19:37.469 --> 19:40.389
about the Taoist concept of <i>Wu Wei.</i>

19:44.726 --> 19:49.022
<i>Wu Wei.</i> Effortless action
for maximum effect!

19:54.194 --> 19:56.071
Okay, alright, alright.

19:56.071 --> 19:59.825
<i>Wu Wei</i> is something you strive for,
but never achieve, right?

20:00.576 --> 20:04.496
Whoa! Okay,

20:04.496 --> 20:06.832
enough banging our heads
against the ceiling.

20:06.832 --> 20:09.001
Let's think of another way.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.587
Earthquake!

20:17.301 --> 20:19.636
We have to think faster.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.307
‐ Lose them in the spiky crystals!

20:26.602 --> 20:29.229
These dudes just won't give up!

20:29.229 --> 20:31.815
Uh, Thunder? Any ideas?

20:34.902 --> 20:37.112
Whoa!

20:37.112 --> 20:39.156
This is not what I had in mind!

20:39.656 --> 20:41.408
What are you doing? We're gonna‐‐

20:46.496 --> 20:49.124
What!? You never told me
you could do that!

20:49.124 --> 20:50.918
Then again,

20:50.918 --> 20:52.753
you don't talk.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.593
‐ Look out!

20:59.593 --> 21:02.679
We're gonna get crushed
if we don't get outta here.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.973
<i>Wu Wei</i>... Minimum effort.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.643
Use your ice and heat blasts together,

21:07.643 --> 21:09.353
like you did before!

21:10.395 --> 21:11.855
Hurry!

21:11.855 --> 21:14.149
Wu! Ice!

21:22.282 --> 21:23.867
Wei! Heat!

21:29.915 --> 21:32.960
Hyah!

21:32.960 --> 21:35.963
Woohoo!
‐ Whoa...

21:36.421 --> 21:39.007
You did it!

21:39.007 --> 21:41.260
You survived and bonded with the dragon.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.345
‐ Two dragons. Kinda.

21:45.681 --> 21:47.432
Thanks?
‐ So,

21:47.432 --> 21:49.977
what's its‐‐ I mean, their names?

21:49.977 --> 21:52.104
‐ Wu and Wei.

21:52.646 --> 21:54.523
Whoa!

21:54.523 --> 21:57.234
It's gonna take a while
before they earn those names,

21:57.234 --> 21:59.403
but we'll get there, right guys?

21:59.403 --> 22:01.488
Stop that.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.782
What happened to those Gembreaker dragons?

22:03.782 --> 22:06.326
‐ Good point actually.
We should get going.

22:11.123 --> 22:13.000
So, what does Wu and Wei mean?

22:13.000 --> 22:15.502
‐ Oh, it's a Chinese thing.
I'll enlighten you later.

22:16.003 --> 22:18.255
‐ What is it, pal?

22:21.300 --> 22:22.843
Whoa.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.095
Did the quake knock those down?

22:25.095 --> 22:27.598
‐ I don't know if it was the quake,

22:27.598 --> 22:28.974
or whatever made that hole.
