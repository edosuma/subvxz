10:00.433 --> 10:02.351
AND I KNOW MOM REALLY
WANTS ME TO GO TO MED SCHOOL,

10:02.435 --> 10:03.686
AND SHE'S NEVER
STEERED ME WRONG.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.187
- [mouthing]

10:05.271 --> 10:08.524
- EXCEPT MAYBE THIS TIME.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.818
YOUR JOB SOUNDS SO SEXY
AND COOL.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.697
MAYBE I SHOULD BE A DETECTIVE.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.996
[loud footsteps]
- I'M BACK.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.040
I FORGOT I HAD TO TALK TO JOY
ABOUT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.750
JOY, A WORD.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.050
- JOY! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.718
NOW SHE WANTS TO BECOME
A DETECTIVE?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.054
- OKAY, CLEARLY
WE'VE HIT A SMALL GLITCH.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.889
I'VE FORGOTTEN
HOW COOL I AM TO THE YOUNG.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.435
- OH, MY GOD.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.395
MY STUPID DATE IS TONIGHT.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.064
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO CANCEL
UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.273
- NO, DON'T CANCEL.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.358
I'LL FIX THIS.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.400
- YOU BETTER.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.902
I--I REALLY HAVE TO GET READY.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.779
I KIND OF EXAGGERATED
ON MY PROFILE A LITTLE BIT,

10:54.862 --> 10:56.781
SO I ONLY HAVE TWO HOURS
TO GROW 6 INCHES

10:56.864 --> 10:58.616
AND LEARN SALSA DANCING.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.036
- JOY, WAIT TILL YOU

11:02.119 --> 11:04.246
SEE THIS GORGEOUS SCREEN SHOT
FROM MY NUDE SCENE.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.208
THAT EDITOR TRANSFORMED ME
FROM THE REALISTIC WAY

11:07.291 --> 11:09.960
I WAS SHOT TO THE WAY
I ACTUALLY LOOK IN MY HEAD.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.631
- VICTORIA, THERE'S A KID HERE.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.216
- WHY ARE YOU SHIELDING HIM?

11:15.299 --> 11:16.675
I'M THE ONE
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SEE IT.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.223
- VICTORIA, YOU LOOK FLAWLESS.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.308
- I KNOW.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.769
LOOK. A TINY BLEMISH.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.773
LOOK. A HUGE BLEMISH.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.776
- WELL, MAYBE
YOU'D LIKE THIS BETTER.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.487
- WHAT IS THAT?
LIKE, A GIANT SEA SPONGE?

11:36.570 --> 11:38.489
- LET ME JUST PULL BACK HERE.

11:38.572 --> 11:42.451
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S MY ASS!

11:42.535 --> 11:44.245
YOU GAVE ME CELLULITE!

11:44.328 --> 11:47.957
- PEOPLE WILL CALL IT
A VERY BRAVE PERFORMANCE.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.084
- YOU BASTARD.
HOW COULD YOU?

11:50.167 --> 11:51.961
- NOT HAVING A DATE
TO MY SISTER'S WEDDING

11:52.044 --> 11:53.671
MUST'VE PUT ME
IN AN UGLY MOOD.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.297
- SO YOU'RE BLACKMAILING ME?

11:58.551 --> 12:02.638
ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT IF YOU DID HAVE A DATE?

12:02.721 --> 12:07.435
- WELL, I'D SAY THAT WOULD...
SMOOTH THINGS OVER.

12:07.518 --> 12:13.274
- AW! AND WHAT IF THAT DATE WAS
JUST FOR A FUN COFFEE INSTEAD?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.319
FINE!

12:17.403 --> 12:18.863
WEDDING IT IS.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.620
- SO COUNCILWOMAN, TO WHAT DOES
THE SANITATION DEPARTMENT

12:26.704 --> 12:28.122
OWE THIS HONOR?

12:28.205 --> 12:32.334
- WELL, ACTUALLY, LANCE HERE
IS HANDLING MY MEETINGS.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.128
HE'S COUNCILMAN FOR THE DAY.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.505
- OH, THAT'S CUTE.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.840
[ahem]

12:37.923 --> 12:41.385
WELL, YOUNG MAN,
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

12:41.469 --> 12:46.682
- JERRY, YOU LOOK
A LITTLE TIRED.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.392
- WELL, SURE, WHO ISN'T?

12:48.476 --> 12:49.852
WAIT.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.021
ARE YOU FIRING ME?

12:52.104 --> 12:53.689
ELKA, WHAT IS THIS?

12:53.772 --> 12:55.524
- HE'S THE COUNCILMAN, JERRY.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.486
MY HANDS ARE TIED.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.321
- I PROMISED MYSELF

13:00.404 --> 13:01.906
I WOULDN'T SPEND THE WHOLE DATE
TALKING ABOUT THIS,

13:01.989 --> 13:06.118
BUT OUR KIDS ARE GOING
TO HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.204
HOW DO YOU KEEP FROM BRAGGING?

13:08.287 --> 13:11.916
- PRETEND THAT SHE
DECIDED NOT TO GO.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.919
- YOU KNOW, I WORRIED
I PUSHED MINE TOO HARD,

13:15.002 --> 13:17.213
BUT THEN YOU
THINK OF THE ALTERNATIVE.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.341
- OH, DON'T WORRY.
I THINK MARRIED MEN ARE SEXY.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.678
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT
TO BE YOUR DAUGHTER?

13:37.650 --> 13:38.859
- WHAT THE HELL, JOY?

13:38.943 --> 13:40.694
YOU TURNED MY BABY
INTO A HONEY TRAP?

13:40.778 --> 13:41.862
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO FIX THIS.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.864
- I TRIED, BUT SHE'S AN ADULT,

13:43.948 --> 13:46.700
AND YOU SAID
YOU'D RESPECT HER DECISIONS.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.369
NOW, THERE'S A HIDDEN CAMERA
ON THE PATIO.

13:48.452 --> 13:50.454
ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS GET
ONE QUICK KISS WITH THIS GUY,

13:50.538 --> 13:51.789
AND DONE.
- I'M GOING IN THERE.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.583
- NO. IF YOU DO,
YOU'LL CAUSE A BIG SCENE

13:54.667 --> 13:57.086
AND YOUR NO-FIGHT RECORD
WILL BE RUINED.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.546
- OH, THAT'S LOW.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.382
YOU KNOW I LOVE THAT RECORD.

14:01.465 --> 14:02.925
- YOU'RE RIGHT, LANCE.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.469
WHY HASN'T MY WIFE
WORKED SINCE I MARRIED HER?

14:05.553 --> 14:07.263
- IT'S JERRY TIME NOW.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.306
GO HOME
AND TELL HER THE GOOD NEWS.

14:13.519 --> 14:17.273
- KID,
YOU PLAYED THAT PERFECTLY.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.734
TWO MARTINIS PLEASE.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.236
- ELKA.

14:22.319 --> 14:27.575
- OH, AND A COKE FOR JUNIOR.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.909
- YOU ARE CUTE.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.578
- SO ARE YOU,

14:30.661 --> 14:32.788
ALTHOUGH THE BORDERS AROUND THAT
MOLE ON YOUR NECK ARE IRREGULAR.

14:32.871 --> 14:35.791
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE
THAT LOOKED AT.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.793
- I LIKE WHAT I'M
LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.

14:37.876 --> 14:40.087
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO KISS A REAL WOMAN?

14:40.170 --> 14:41.589
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:41.672 --> 14:43.632
- SURE,
SHE'S YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL,

14:43.716 --> 14:45.426
BUT WOULDN'T YOU
PREFER A VEHICLE

14:45.509 --> 14:48.470
WITH A LITTLE MORE MILEAGE
ON IT?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.805
KISS ME.
- OKAY.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.098
- WHAT? NO,
HE'S SUPPOSED TO KISS ME.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.602
GO AWAY,
STRANGE WOMAN I DON'T KNOW.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.811
- KISS ME.
- NO, KISS ME.

14:55.894 --> 14:56.854
- NO, KISS ME.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.314
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN KISS?

14:58.397 --> 15:00.316
HALF YOUR MONEY GOOD-BYE.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.776
- SHERRI, HONEY, I CAN EXPLAIN.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.278
- WHAT'S THERE TO EXPLAIN?

15:04.361 --> 15:07.323
YOU'RE CHEATING ON ME
WITH THESE TWO WHORES.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.826
- MY DAUGHTER IS NOT A WHORE.

15:10.909 --> 15:12.995
THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO SAY,

15:13.078 --> 15:14.830
"MY MOM'S NOT A WHORE EITHER."

15:14.913 --> 15:16.290
- SHE'S NOT.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.545
- MOTHER AND DAUGHTER?

15:21.629 --> 15:22.671
YOU DEGENERATE!

15:22.755 --> 15:24.465
- HONEY, WAIT.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.843
IT WAS THEIR FAULT.
- UH, MELANIE?

15:27.926 --> 15:29.345
- OH, JUSTIN.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.888
THIS ISN'T WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.431
NO, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET THAT MAN TO KISS ME

15:32.514 --> 15:34.767
BEFORE HE KISSED MY DAUGHTER.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.355
YEAH, IT'S OKAY IF YOU GO.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.692
- MELANIE,
I TOLD YOU NOT TO INTERFERE.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.361
- YEAH, BUT I HAD TO.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.988
JENNA, HONEY, THIS ISN'T YOU.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.324
YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.993
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SEDUCING
SLEAZY MEN FOR MONEY LIKE JOY.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.793
- THAT ISN'T MY ENTIRE LIFE.

16:00.876 --> 16:04.588
LOOK, JENNA IS A NATURAL
BORN HONEY TRAP WHO WILL BE

16:04.672 --> 16:07.591
SITTING HERE SEDUCING SLEAZY MEN
FOR YEARS TO COME.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.843
RIGHT, JENNA?

16:09.927 --> 16:11.428
- ACTUALLY, NO.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.554
THIS ISN'T ME.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.556
I WAS TOTALLY LAME AT IT.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.519
AND THEN YOU CAME IN
AND WERE JUST AS LAME AS I WAS .

16:18.602 --> 16:21.939
- WELL, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET
A CHANCE TO SHOW MY STUFF.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.193
BUT GO ON.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.569
- MOM,
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT SCHOOL.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.571
I THINK I JUST GOT SCARED.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.573
WHAT IF I'M
THE DUMBEST PERSON THERE?

16:31.657 --> 16:37.246
- THEN YOU'RE THE DUMBEST PERSON
AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.123
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.417
HONEY, DOES THIS MEAN YOU
CHANGED YOUR MIND ABOUT GOING?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.377
- OKAY, DON'T GO CRAZY...
BUT YES.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.546
- OH! YES!
OH, HONEY, THANK YOU!

16:45.629 --> 16:47.089
THANK YOU.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!

16:47.172 --> 16:51.218
MY DAUGHTER'S GOING
TO HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL!

16:51.301 --> 16:53.095
NOW GO WIPE THAT WHORISH
MAKEUP OFF YOUR FACE.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.139
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M NOT JOY ANYMORE.

17:01.937 --> 17:06.066
- WELL, PUTTING THAT ASIDE,
MY PLAN WORKED.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.608
- WHAT PLAN?

17:07.693 --> 17:10.404
- I KNEW IF I SET HER UP
IN THIS AWFUL SITUATION,

17:10.487 --> 17:12.781
SHE WOULD HATE IT
AND COME TO HER SENSES.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.116
- WAIT, SO NONE
OF THIS WAS REAL?

17:14.199 --> 17:16.660
- ALL THOSE PEOPLE WERE ACTORS.
- AW, JOY.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.496
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

17:19.579 --> 17:21.330
I COULD'VE PLAYED ALONG.
- OH, YOU WOULD'VE BLOWN IT.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.665
YOU'RE TERRIBLE AT PRETENDING.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.292
- I AM NOT.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.794
- SORRY, I FORGOT MY PURSE.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.921
- OH, WELL, I WAS JUST
UPBRAIDING JOY, YOU KNOW,

17:28.005 --> 17:30.340
FOR GETTING YOU CAUGHT UP
IN ALL HER SHENANIGANS.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.551
JOY!

17:36.555 --> 17:38.766
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WOULD'VE BLOWN IT.

17:46.064 --> 17:48.108
- THANKS FOR COMING, VICTORIA.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.777
I'M SORRY
YOU DIDN'T HAVE MORE FUN.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.820
- WELL, AS I SAID
TO MORE THAN ONE EX-HUSBAND,

17:51.904 --> 17:55.699
I DID WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO,
BUT I CAN'T PRETEND I LIKED IT.

18:00.078 --> 18:03.165
- BUT I REALLY LIKE YOU,
VICTORIA.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.333
I LOOK AT YOUR FACE ALL DAY,

18:04.416 --> 18:06.502
AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF IT.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.962
- SO YOU RESORTED TO BLACKMAIL?

18:09.046 --> 18:11.799
- BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
GONE OUT WITH ME OTHERWISE.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.635
YOU WOULD HAVE SAID I'M NOT RICH
ENOUGH OR FAMOUS ENOUGH,

18:14.718 --> 18:16.345
OR I'M TOO YOUNG.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.056
HAVEN'T YOU EVER USED BLACKMAIL
TO GET SOMETHING YOU LOVE?

18:19.139 --> 18:22.893
- WELL, OF COURSE--THAT'S
HOW I RAISED THREE CHILDREN.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.479
BUT BARNEY,
YOU ARE VERY YOUNG.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.481
- BUT VICTORIA,
YOU LOOK VERY YOUNG.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.316
- WELL,
YOU CAN'T ARGUE THE FACTS.

18:32.277 --> 18:36.198
- I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.950
HOW BAD WOULD IT BE
SPENDING TIME WITH SOMEONE

18:38.033 --> 18:39.618
WHO'S CRAZY ABOUT YOU?

18:43.121 --> 18:46.333
- WELL,
YOU'RE CERTAINLY PERSISTENT.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.419
ALL RIGHT, ONE DATE, AND WE'LL
SEE WHERE IT GOES FROM THERE.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.556
- THANK YOU,

19:09.857 --> 19:11.692

AND I LIKED IT.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.739
- YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.617
- ACTUALLY, THE COUNCIL
PASSED A BILL CHANGING THAT.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.369
YOU SPONSORED IT.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.580
I SLIPPED IT IN WITH SOME OF
THE PAPERWORK THAT YOU SIGNED.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.081
YOU TAUGHT ME THAT TRICK.

19:26.164 --> 19:27.791
- I DID.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.711
I TAUGHT YOU
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,

19:30.794 --> 19:34.047
BUT NOT EVERYTHING I KNOW.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.716
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:35.799 --> 19:38.260
- IT MEANS THE MAYOR
WON'T SIGN THIS BILL.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.761
- WHY NOT?

19:39.845 --> 19:44.266
- BECAUSE...
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.934
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.
