(TAPPING ON MIC)

00:48.173 --> 00:50.915
RICKY GERVAIS: Testing. Testing.

00:51.009 --> 00:56.470
Testing over the credits.
The credits that no one cares about.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.259
"Ooh, we’re the business people.

00:58.350 --> 01:02.309
"Ooh, we want our credit
before the film starts, 'cause... "

01:02.437 --> 01:03.597
Anyway.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.896
The story you’re about to see
takes place in a world

01:05.983 --> 01:09.271
where the human race has never evolved
the ability to tell a lie.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.352
This is a typical town in that world.

01:11.488 --> 01:15.982
As you can see, people have jobs and cars
and houses and families,

01:16.118 --> 01:18.825
but everyone tells the absolute truth.

01:18.954 --> 01:22.663
There’s no such thing
as deceit or flattery or fiction.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.907
People say exactly what they think,

01:25.002 --> 01:27.414
and sometimes that can come across
as a bit harsh.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.086
But they've got no choice in the matter.
It's their nature.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.004
Look, I'm not coming in to work today.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.466
No, I'm not sick. I just hate it there.

01:34.803 --> 01:38.170
Oh, your baby is so ugly. It's like a little rat.

01:38.849 --> 01:43.092
Wow! I just took one of the biggest poops
of my whole life.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.266
What are you ordering?

01:44.354 --> 01:47.596
GERVAIS: So if you're a chubby,
little loser like this guy, for example,

01:47.691 --> 01:49.352
that's Mark Bellison, by the way,

01:49.443 --> 01:52.901
then you're all alone
and at the bottom of the pile.

01:52.988 --> 01:56.196
But later on in the story,
his luck's gonna change

01:56.283 --> 01:58.490
when he tells the world's first lie.

01:58.577 --> 02:01.068
He doesn't even know it himself yet.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.279
So look forward to that.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.993
(EXHALES)

02:13.425 --> 02:15.131
Don't blow this.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.139
-Hi!
-Hi.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.689
You're early.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.563
I was just masturbating.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.270
That makes me think of your vagina.

02:37.366 --> 02:40.108
I'm Mark. How are you?

02:40.202 --> 02:41.612
A little frustrated at the moment.

02:41.703 --> 02:45.821
Also, equally depressed and pessimistic
about our date tonight.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.455
Sure.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.453
I'm Anna. Come on in.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.000
Um... Just wait there.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.627
I need to finish getting ready.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.549
While doing that,
I might realise I'm still horny

02:58.637 --> 03:00.593
and try to finish masturbating
without you hearing.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.091
(CHUCKLES)

03:12.818 --> 03:15.025
I feel awkward now about being early.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.398
ANNA: Yeah,
I'm disappointed that you're early

03:17.489 --> 03:19.525
and not really looking forward
to tonight in general,

03:19.616 --> 03:21.607
but the thought of being alone
the rest of my life

03:21.702 --> 03:24.489
scares both my mother and me equally.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.948
Sure.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.128
Oh.

03:37.175 --> 03:42.920
I'm thinking you've started masturbating,
'cause it's like it's too quiet.

03:43.014 --> 03:47.007
And you said you were gonna
try and do it without me hearing.

03:50.021 --> 03:54.515
I'm worried the restaurant I've picked
isn't expensive enough for you.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.276
It's all I can afford

03:58.363 --> 04:00.103
in my situation.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.031
I know I'm in my 40s,

04:03.160 --> 04:06.618
but I haven't got any
financial assets to speak of.

04:07.497 --> 04:11.331
Also, my boss said
he's probably gonna fire me this week.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.214
Wow!

04:19.341 --> 04:20.707
I just masturbated.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.426
That makes me horny.
I hope this date ends in sex.

04:23.513 --> 04:24.753
I don't find you attractive.

04:24.848 --> 04:25.963
Oh!

04:26.808 --> 04:28.173
Shall we?

04:28.769 --> 04:29.929
Yeah.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.011
-After you.
-Thanks.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.513
(SIGHS)

04:38.653 --> 04:41.861
-This is not as nice as I remember it.
-What are we gonna talk about?

04:41.948 --> 04:44.109
Hi. I'm threatened by you.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.034
Mark Bellison. Table for two.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.202
Of course. Come with me.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.617
MARK: Thank you.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.539
Thank you.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.710
-Plastic.
-I'm very embarrassed I work here.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.166
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.592
-Hello.
-And you're very pretty.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.048
That only makes this worse.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.380
(CLEARS THROAT) Can I get
you two started on some drinks?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.340
-ANNA: Yes.
-I'll have a Budweiser, please.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.426
I'll have a mango margarita,

05:12.521 --> 05:16.059
and I'll probably have three more drinks
by the end of the night.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.560
-Your sister?
-No.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.267
-Daughter?
-No.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.477
She's way out of your league.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.606
(STAMMERS)

05:22.697 --> 05:24.107
Thank you.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.988
Shall I ask you
some questions about yourself?

05:33.083 --> 05:34.243
Yes.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.332
How do you spend your days?

05:36.419 --> 05:37.579
I get up at 8:00 in the morning

05:37.671 --> 05:39.707
because the noise from my alarm clock
interrupts my sleep.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.631
And I lean over and just turn it off.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.958
Turn it off.
That's more specific than I thought.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.463
-Oh. What did you want to know?
-Just...

05:46.555 --> 05:49.592
-Well, do you have a job?
-I have a job in an office.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.968
-What do you do?
-I'm an executive.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.174
-Do you enjoy that?
-No.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.305
-Oh!
-But I enjoy the end result of the job,

05:54.396 --> 05:55.932
which is money.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.809
And also the hours are pretty good
for the amount of money I make,

05:58.942 --> 06:02.776
which I spend on things I like,
such as clothes and hiking and drinking,

06:02.863 --> 06:04.774
even though I know it's bad for me.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.403
But I'd rather just get all the money
and not have to work for the results.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.858
Oh, sure.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.785
Tell me something about you, though.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.784
You already know a lot about me.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.538
You know I'm good-looking
because, well, here I am.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.540
And you know that I'm successful

06:20.630 --> 06:23.997
because you've seen my apartment
and the clothes that I'm wearing.

06:24.134 --> 06:27.342
And you know I'm happy
because I'm smiling.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.631
-Are you always happy?
-Usually.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.715
Some days I stay in bed, eating and crying.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.310
-There you go.
-Thank you.

06:37.397 --> 06:41.481
-I had a little sip of this from right there, so...
-Okay.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.318
You guys ready to order
or do you need a moment?

06:45.447 --> 06:46.732
I'm good.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.407
Oh! I'll have the Caesar salad with chicken
because I think I'm fat,

06:50.493 --> 06:53.326
but I also think I deserve
something that tastes good.

06:53.455 --> 06:56.071
I'll have the fish tacos
'cause it's what I had last time I was here.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.827
It's all I know.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.867
Great. I'll get those two started.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.710
If I gave you my number, would you call me?

07:02.839 --> 07:03.954
No.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.123
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

07:06.217 --> 07:07.923
Sorry. It's my mom.

07:08.011 --> 07:11.344
I think she's probably checking on the date.
It won't take long.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.679
Hello.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.014
Yes, I'm with him right now.

07:15.644 --> 07:19.182
No, not very attractive.
No, doesn't make much money.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.764
It's all right, though.
Seems nice. Kind of funny.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.269
A bit fat.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.362
Has a funny little snub nose.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.696
(EXCLAIMS)

07:29.783 --> 07:33.275
Kind of like a frog in the facial area.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.530
Yeah, but...

07:34.663 --> 07:36.779
No, I won't be sleeping with him tonight.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.205
No. Probably not even a kiss.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.538
Okay. You, too. Bye. Sorry about that.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.291
It's all right. Don't think twice.
How is your mum, all right?

07:45.382 --> 07:48.044
-She's all right...
-Great. That's...

07:54.015 --> 07:57.223
Thanks for going on this date with me.

07:57.686 --> 08:01.224
You're way out of my league,
and I know you only did it as a favour to Greg

08:01.356 --> 08:04.848
and I'll probably never
hear from you again, but...

08:05.235 --> 08:08.352
I had a better time than I thought I'd have.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.985
But I won't really know how I feel about you
till I'm a little less drunk.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.281
-Sure.
-Yeah.

08:13.368 --> 08:17.407
Well, call me tomorrow
if you still like me when you're sober.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.074
I might.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.622
Oh! Thank you for kissing me on the cheek.

08:21.710 --> 08:25.828
I know you didn't have to do...
You're very pretty! Good night!

08:28.675 --> 08:32.543
MAN: (ON TV)...first used
roughly 4,000 years ago on Celtic chariots,

08:32.636 --> 08:39.349
was, for the most part,
unchanged by man until the late 1800s.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.937
Hi, I'm Bob. I'm the spokesperson
for The Coca-Cola Company.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.481
I'm here today to ask you
to continue buying Coke.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.104
I'm sure it's the drink
you've been drinking for years

08:48.194 --> 08:49.730
and if you still enjoy it, well,
I'd like to remind you

08:49.821 --> 08:51.277
to buy it again sometime soon.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.693
It's basically just brown sugar water.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.148
Haven’t changed the ingredients much lately,

08:55.243 --> 08:57.279
so there's nothing new
I can tell you about that.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.235
Changed the can around a little bit, though.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.866
You can see the colours are different there,

09:00.957 --> 09:03.073
and we've added a polar bear,
so the kids like us.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.875
Coke's very high in sugar,
and like any high-calorie soda,

09:05.962 --> 09:09.420
it can lead to obesity in children and adults
who don't sustain a very healthy diet.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.169
And that's it. It's Coke.
It's very famous. Everyone knows it.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.718
I'm Bob. I work for Coke.
And I'm asking you to not stop buying Coke.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.090
That's all.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.217
(SLURPING)

09:19.100 --> 09:20.840
It's a bit sweet.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.099
Thank you.

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

09:38.953 --> 09:40.693
Hold the elevator.

09:41.289 --> 09:45.032
-Hey, Mark. How's it going?
-Hi, Frank. Not too well.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.618
I went on a date last night with a girl
I've had a crush on for years,

09:48.713 --> 09:50.294
and she'll most likely never call me again.

09:50.381 --> 09:54.795
Oh, and I think I'm getting fired today.
How about you?

09:55.720 --> 09:58.837
Oh, I'm not too great, actually.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.547
I've been throwing up painkillers all night

10:00.642 --> 10:05.102
because I'm too afraid to take enough
to actually kill myself, so...

10:05.563 --> 10:07.474
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

10:08.191 --> 10:10.147
See you tomorrow.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.148
If I'm not dead, then sure.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.613
-Good. That's settled, then.
-All right. Have a nice day.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.780
MARK: Cheers.

10:36.719 --> 10:40.428
This isn't natural!
None of this is natural! We're all animals!

10:40.515 --> 10:43.507
Why am I wearing clothes?
How do you people live like this?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.055
Why is there all this concrete?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.853
I woke up this morning and realised,
not only do I not love you,

10:48.940 --> 10:51.431
but also the thought
of sleeping with you sickens me.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.233
That should make me not love you,
but it only makes me love you more.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.355
(GROANS IN FRUSTRATION)

11:06.374 --> 11:10.708
I just don't want to go in there today.
I just don't, you know?

All of Lecture Films' productions are written,
filmed and edited on this very lot.

11:17.302 --> 11:21.261
In fact, this building is
where Lecture Films' talented writers

11:21.347 --> 11:25.215
scour the world's past events
for the most dramatic,

11:25.310 --> 11:28.802
entertaining and even hilarious moments
from world history,

11:28.897 --> 11:32.981
which are then turned into scripts,
handed over to our world-famous readers

11:33.067 --> 11:37.276
to read off of teleprompters
and then filmed for your viewing pleasure.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.651
Now, if you'll just follow me over here,
I will give you a sneak peek

11:40.742 --> 11:43.905
of Lecture Films'
upcoming summer blockbuster,

11:43.995 --> 11:47.658
Napoleon: 1812 to 1813.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.907
MALE NARRATOR: Coming soon
from Lecture Films,

11:51.002 --> 11:55.462
screenplay by Brad Kessler
and starring Nathan Goldfrappe,

11:55.548 --> 11:59.166
Napoleon: 1812 to 1813.

11:59.260 --> 12:03.094
And so Napoleon invaded Russia

12:03.181 --> 12:07.299
with a brute force
of nearly 700,000 men behind him,

12:07.393 --> 12:11.887
armed with muskets
and supported by cannon brigades.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.893
Crippled by disease and hunger,

12:14.984 --> 12:17.851
Napoleon’s men persevered.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.732
It was then that...

12:19.822 --> 12:20.902
Oh, look, everyone.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.482
There's Mark Bellison,
one of Lecture Films' very own screenwriters.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.069
Mark is one of Lecture Films'
least successful screenwriters.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.780
I also hear he's most likely
getting fired today.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.035

watch them put the final touches

12:35.088 --> 12:39.548
on the upcoming Lecture Films feature,
The Invention of the Fork. Right this way.

I realise more and more every day
how overqualified I am for this position

12:56.567 --> 12:59.309
and how incompetent you are at yours.

12:59.821 --> 13:00.901
Any messages?

13:00.989 --> 13:04.607
Anthony is coming up within the hour to see
if he can get up the courage to fire you.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.443
If he can't, he said
that he'll definitely do it tomorrow.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.949
Anything else?
Any messages not to do with being fired?

13:10.039 --> 13:11.904
Well, I told everyone
you're getting fired this week

13:12.000 --> 13:13.536
and they shouldn't expect
their calls returned,

13:13.626 --> 13:14.991
so no one left any messages.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.872
Okay. Next time...

13:16.963 --> 13:18.703
I don't think there'll be a next time.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.834
...take the message,
just in case I don't get fired.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.085
You're almost definitely getting fired.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.508
Yeah, but I'm still here now, so...

13:24.595 --> 13:25.880
Seems like a waste of time.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.052
No, it's not.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.803
You're getting paid for it, so let's
take the message in case I don't get...

13:30.893 --> 13:32.804
-But everyone knows that you are.
-Hasn't happened yet.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.432
Okay. But everyone knows you are.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.724
I'll be in the office, don't...

13:39.819 --> 13:42.105
Okay.
I'll be searching for new jobs on Craigslist.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.982
You should probably
just get on with your work.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.064
SHELLEY: No, thank you!

14:03.676 --> 14:05.416
Anthony?

14:12.310 --> 14:14.096
Come in. What?

14:18.483 --> 14:19.814
Come in.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.401
Well, you look really depressed today.
That's gonna make this so much harder.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.323
-Anthony, don't fire me.
-Oh, Mark.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.321
The 1300s, they're so boring.

14:31.412 --> 14:36.076
And the last two scripts
you turned in were depressing.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.623
They were about the Black Plague.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.951
It's the 1300s.
What am I meant to write about?

14:40.046 --> 14:43.459
It's not totally your fault, Mark.
You got stuck with a tough century.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.040
-No, no, I can make it work.
-Mark.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.500
Just give it up.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.883
Nothing new is gonna
have happened in the 1300s.

14:50.973 --> 14:54.716
At Lecture Films, we just want to take
the big-name readers of the day

14:54.811 --> 14:59.225
and have them read the stories
that people know and love.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.560
I'm having...

15:02.443 --> 15:04.525
Can I... Do you mind if I...

15:04.612 --> 15:06.273
-I come back and do this tomorrow?
-Oh, well...

15:06.364 --> 15:10.528
No, I just got nervous about firing you.
I just don't do well with confrontation.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.906
Hey, maybe... Maybe if I just sleep on it.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.703
Well, then I'll be thinking,
"Will he fire me, won't he fire me?"

15:16.791 --> 15:19.749
-You're fired.
-I am fired, yeah? 'Cause I sort of...

15:19.836 --> 15:22.043
Yeah. Oh, boy.

ANNA: Mark, I woke up this morning,
sober, and realised that,

15:31.681 --> 15:33.262
while I did enjoy your company,

15:33.349 --> 15:36.557
based on your looks, your financial situation
and your position in life,

15:36.644 --> 15:38.635
I have no interest in you romantically.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.061
I'm just too far out of your league. Anna.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.889
(GROANING)

15:42.984 --> 15:44.895
Is that 'cause you just got fired?

15:44.986 --> 15:48.023
And 'cause I just got an e-mail
from a woman who...

15:48.114 --> 15:52.574
Yeah, my favourite part was when she said
it was based on your looks.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.575
You read my e-mail?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.618
Yeah. Everyone's read it.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.867
It's the best one you've had all year.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.323
Not for me.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.000
I'm gonna get a snack. Do you want a snack?

16:14.098 --> 16:15.429
So?

16:15.516 --> 16:19.225
I loathed almost every minute
that I worked for you.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.806
So, what are you gonna do now?

16:23.357 --> 16:24.688
I don't know.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.857
But I don't hold out much hope for the future.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.902
I don't have a lot of hope for you either,
but I wish you good luck.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.525
-Bye, Mark.
-Bye, Shelley.

16:31.616 --> 16:32.696
-Mark!
-Yeah?

16:32.783 --> 16:34.444
-Do you mind if I talk to you for a second?
-No.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.742
-I heard the news they were firing you, huh?
-Yeah.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.491
-That must be hard.
-Yeah.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.665
Well, I just wanted to say goodbye,
and I've always hated you.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.458
-You've always...
-Hated you.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.161
-I didn't know that.
-Yeah, a lot of people knew it.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.588
-What, you told other people you hated me?
-Yeah.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.336
I even turned some people against you.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.543
Is that why you came over to talk to me?
To tell me you hated me?

16:53.638 --> 16:56.004
No, I came to say goodbye to you,

16:56.098 --> 16:57.508
and the rest of it
just sort of happened on its own.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.090
Came out, yeah, sure.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.928
I always knew that the Black Plague
would never work as a movie.

17:03.064 --> 17:06.101
You're an awful writer,
assigned to an awful century.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.065
And you're a little man-bitch.

17:08.611 --> 17:09.771
(MOUTHING) Man-bitch.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.605
But I've always been threatened by you

17:13.741 --> 17:16.027
because there's something about you
that I don't understand,

17:16.117 --> 17:18.450
and I hate things that I don't understand.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.950
But you'll always be a loser.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.789
And I'll always be more successful
than you in nearly every way,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.707
and that's just the way it is.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.036
Oh, and Shelley thinks
you're an overweight homosexual.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.792
-No, I never said that.
-Thank you.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.210
I said, "Fat faggot."

17:33.302 --> 17:34.963
"Fatty, fat faggot."

17:35.054 --> 17:36.134
I stand corrected.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.553
And I was upset with
"overweight homosexual."

17:37.640 --> 17:39.301
Doesn't matter.
Either way, you're a dumpy little queer.

I already have. Martha Bellison, I'm her son.

Ooh, it's good you're here.
She's not doing well.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.346
You should say your final goodbyes today.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.844
Yeah. Someone says that to me
every time I come here.

18:26.981 --> 18:29.597
She's at the top of our death pool.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.031

I'll pick you up tomorrow, about 8:00?

37:18.486 --> 37:21.978
Most likely, though, this will be our last date,
so just know that.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.938
Yeah. Great.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.068
Okay. Bye!

MALE NARRATOR: ...proudly presents
The Industrial Revolution.

37:38.631 --> 37:41.589
Hello, I'm Angelo Badsmith.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.634
Come, watch me read
about the exciting events

37:44.721 --> 37:47.428
that took place during
the Industrial Revolution,

37:47.515 --> 37:52.305
written by the most beloved and esteemed
screenwriter of his generation,

37:52.395 --> 37:54.101
Brad Kessler.

37:54.189 --> 37:58.649
I don't think anyone can write
a better screenplay than Brad Kessler.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.399
No?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.672
BRAD: Hey!

38:30.767 --> 38:33.224
Did you come to beg for your job back?

38:33.311 --> 38:34.517
Everybody!

38:34.604 --> 38:36.310
That's the loser that thought
the Black Plague

38:36.397 --> 38:37.682
would make an interesting film.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.981
Hey! Good luck, douche bag.

38:42.529 --> 38:44.861
-You can't go in there.
-I've got an appointment.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.813
Oh, then go right in.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.948
Talk to you later.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.611
Hi. That was the head of the studio.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.374
Why are you here?

38:58.461 --> 39:03.376
Well, when you fired me,
I was seriously depressed.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.832
-I knew it.
-But...

39:06.386 --> 39:09.469
I went for a walk, right out of town.

39:09.556 --> 39:14.266
And I came across a desert,
and I fell asleep under a tree, palm tree.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.810
I don't do well
with other people's life-changing stories.

39:17.897 --> 39:22.186
And then when I woke up,
I saw like a thing sticking out of the sand.

39:22.277 --> 39:26.896
And I unearthed it,
and it was an ancient chest.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.356
Really old. Seven hundred years old.

39:29.450 --> 39:33.284
And in that chest was this.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.451
What is it?

39:34.539 --> 39:37.827
It's a never-before-heard event from history.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.291
When does it take place?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.493
1300s.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.998
Oh, come on, no, Mark!

39:43.089 --> 39:46.923
Mark, I've already told you,
we don't do Black Plague movies here!

39:47.010 --> 39:51.003
It's not about the Black Plague!
It's not just about the Black Plague.

39:51.097 --> 39:54.055
It's about... Can I just read it, please?

39:54.767 --> 39:57.383
Get excited. Don't tap, get excited.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.843
Get very excited,

39:58.938 --> 40:05.434
because this is one of the best discoveries

40:05.528 --> 40:08.691
man has ever discovered.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.021
And you can be part of it.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.732
Yes, but is there a movie there?

40:12.827 --> 40:16.445
The greatest movie
Lecture Films has ever made.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.955
Start reading.

40:22.128 --> 40:27.668
"On the very first day of the 14th century,
a momentous occasion occurred.

40:27.759 --> 40:33.550
"It began like any other day.
The sun rose, babies began to cry.

40:33.640 --> 40:37.053
"But all of that was interrupted
when a giant, flying spaceship

"crashed down from the skies
and landed in the heart of Babylon."

What?

40:47.111 --> 40:50.820
Uh... Get everyone in here, right now.
We got a big one.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.068
Oh, please, Mark, continue.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.821
MARK: "The ninja army
unleashed a giant fireball

40:59.916 --> 41:03.909
"and brought the robot dinosaur
to its knees, saving Mars, Earth

41:04.045 --> 41:08.505
"and the nude Amazonian alien women,
all in one sweeping motion.

"Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to marry
by alien King Wanglor.

"It was to be the first human

"and no expense would be spared.

41:20.979 --> 41:24.346
"All of Babylon and Mars were invited
to join the celebrations.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.147
"The wedding was held
on a brisk summer's day on Mars.

"And all of the survivors

the best screenplay ever written.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.465
Oh, it will.

42:38.556 --> 42:42.970
It will be the best screenplay
ever written by anyone.

42:52.528 --> 42:53.813
Well...

42:55.031 --> 42:57.522
I guess congratulations
on selling your script today.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.740
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.785
My dad was an alcoholic.

43:10.880 --> 43:12.086
Sad.

43:12.173 --> 43:16.257
Drinking got to a point where he lost his job,
and with a family to support,

43:16.344 --> 43:18.380
he had no choice
but to turn to a life of crime.

43:18.513 --> 43:20.049
What kind of crime?

43:20.181 --> 43:23.048
Burglary. Houses, mainly.

43:30.399 --> 43:31.479
What are you doing here?

43:31.567 --> 43:33.523
It's Monday at noon.
You're not supposed to be at home now.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.602
If you must know,
I'm incredibly stressed at work.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.732
I've come home early.
I'm having a bit of me time.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.230
More importantly, what are you doing?

43:39.367 --> 43:40.982
Well, I was gonna rob your house.

43:41.077 --> 43:42.408
I don't like that idea. Not a fan of that at all.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.277
Well, I'm not gonna do it now
because you're in.

43:44.372 --> 43:45.452
And do you know what's gonna happen?

43:45.540 --> 43:47.030
I'm gonna call the police,
you're gonna be arrested.

43:47.125 --> 43:48.786
Well, I'm just gonna leave,
and you don't know my name.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.207
-What is your name?
-Richard Bellison.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.704
(LAUGHING) Good to meet you.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.833
You've got two options. Option one,
I send the police to your house, right?

43:54.924 --> 43:57.256
Arrest you there,
embarrass you in front of your neighbours.

43:57.385 --> 43:59.797
Or option two, you just come in
and wait for the police here.

43:59.887 --> 44:02.048
-No, I'll wait.
-Yeah?

44:02.140 --> 44:04.597
-Come on in then. Do you want a cup of tea?
-Yeah, that'd be great.

of his life in jail.

44:07.562 --> 44:08.847
I never really knew him.

44:08.938 --> 44:13.102
But I've been blessed
with some luck as well in my life.

44:13.234 --> 44:14.974
I had a wonderful mother who raised me.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.776
-Oh, that's sweet.
-She's great.

44:17.905 --> 44:18.894
Where is she?

44:19.031 --> 44:21.067
At an old people's home.

44:21.701 --> 44:24.943
But I'm gonna get her out of there tomorrow.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.073
I'm gonna get her a mansion,

44:27.206 --> 44:29.071
so she can spend
the rest of her life in luxury.

but these just look awful.

44:36.799 --> 44:37.879
They look fine to me.

44:37.967 --> 44:39.878
Well, you're stupid.

44:45.933 --> 44:47.093
I was thinking.

44:47.226 --> 44:51.310
Now I'm obviously rich and successful and...

44:51.439 --> 44:58.402
Maybe I'm in your league
and that we could be together, romantically.

44:59.572 --> 45:01.608
What would be the point?

45:03.284 --> 45:05.070
We might enjoy it.

45:07.955 --> 45:11.789
Well, I do like you
and I do enjoy your company.

45:11.918 --> 45:13.749
And if we were to get together and procreate,

45:13.836 --> 45:16.919
I would like the offspring
that are carrying half my genetic code

45:17.006 --> 45:20.544
to be well taken care of, financially stable.

I also think you'd make a good father
and a good husband, which I like.

45:24.472 --> 45:25.803
Fantastic.

45:27.016 --> 45:29.098
Unfortunately, none of that changes the fact

45:29.185 --> 45:33.770
that you'd still be contributing
half the genetic code to our children.

45:36.275 --> 45:39.813

What do you mean, she's gonna die tonight?

46:10.017 --> 46:12.884
It does not look very good.
She suffered a major heart attack.

46:13.020 --> 46:16.763
Her heart is very weak.
Her pulse is not very strong.

46:16.857 --> 46:19.724
Her blood pressure is dropping rapidly,

46:19.860 --> 46:24.729
and she will probably suffer
a fatal heart attack sometime tonight.

46:24.865 --> 46:27.902
Yes. Still going to die.

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.297
I landed, baby safe. But then this bear...

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.090
-Wait, how did you survive?
-Well, let me tell you.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:14.918
No, how did you survive the jump?

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.844
I've seen you twist your ankle
crossing the street.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:21.265
Because on this occasion
I landed in something soft.

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:22.387
-Oh.
-So...

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:23.810
What did you land in?

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.228
-Jam.
-Jam.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:29.308
It was a barrel of jam.
It was a jam factory on fire.

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:30.892
Probably what attracted the bear
in the first place.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.228
-Right.
-You haven't heard of that?

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:37.274
The burning building, baby,
bear, factory, jam incident?

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:38.483
Shoot, no.

01:06:38.578 --> 01:06:41.365
Yeah, classic. So, I land.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:45.324
This bear is coming toward,
big, lumbering, eating machine

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.830
Iike that happy chap over there.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.912
-What, sleeping, ugly fatty?
-Well...

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.088
-He's not happy.
-Well, how do you know?

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.667
What do you mean?
Look at him. He's a loser.

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:59.254
MARK: You can't tell that
from just looking at the guy.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:02.091
He could be the world's greatest poet.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.596
Well, he probably is a loser. Bad example.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:08.096
But I'm saying, it doesn't have to be,
just by...

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:11.687
Okay. What do you see
when you see this fellow here?

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.109
ANNA: Short, sweaty, bald guy.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.606
-Right.
-Hi!

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:17.112
MARK: He's carrying a briefcase.
He's in a hurry.

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:19.858
He's probably off to
a really important meeting.

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:22.114
He's probably a high-powered businessman.

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:24.033
You see more than I do.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.705
Well, because, if you look...

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:29.785
What do you see when you see those guys?

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:31.286
ANNA: Mmm...

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:35.123
Two nerdy losers in hats?

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:38.919
Yeah. Good. Good observational skills.

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:45.093
But what I mean is, look beyond
just their appearance and look at them.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.304
They're holding hands. They're in love.

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:54.646
Hey, do me.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:58.230
I mean, just what do you see?
What do you see in me?

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.610
You're pretty.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.237
You've got a wonderful smile.

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:05.820
-Well, that's what everyone sees.
-I wasn't finished.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:09.912
You're the sweetest,
most caring person I know.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:13.166
And you've got a freckle there
I've never told you about how much I love.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.084
You usually smile,

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:18.837
but sometimes you spend your day in bed,
eating and crying.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:22.133
You'll hold someone's hand
after their mum...

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:28.305
You're the most wonderful person
I've ever met.

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:35.566
What do you see when you look at me?

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:43.700
You're chubby and you have a snub nose.

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:47.157
Yeah. That's about it.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:49.033
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.410
You're smart.

01:08:56.506 --> 01:08:57.917
You're kind.

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:01.550
You're the sweetest man I've ever met.

01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:06.221
You are definitely
the most interesting person I know.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:08.553
And you are fun to be with.

01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:11.560
And you see the world in a way
that nobody else sees the world,

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:14.395
and I like the way you see the world.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:17.395
And you're my best friend.

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:21.192
You make me happier
than anyone I've ever known.

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.624
-Why can't we be together, then?
-Because of the whole genetics thing.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:35.209
Little fat kids with snub noses.

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:43.051
It's a shame that being rich and famous
doesn't change your genetics.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:46.428
Because I love you.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:53.520
Does being rich and famous
change your genetic material?

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.315
No.

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:07.655
It doesn't. Our kids would be
little fat things with snub noses.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:16.538
BOB: (ON RADIO) Thanks for that, Jim.
Next up, Mark Bellison.

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:17.664
Does he deserve all the money and fame

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:20.834
or is he just some fat loser
who hears things from the man in the sky?

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:22.082
JIM: I say fat loser, Bob.

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:24.838
BOB: It's as simple as this, Jim.
Just look at the guy.

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:27.713
He’s fat, he’s stupid-looking.
What else do you need to know?

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:30.093
JIM: And what about the hundreds of people
camping out on his lawn?

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:32.140
I mean, don’t those people have jobs?

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.014
BOB: Maybe they're all fat losers like him.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:35.728

-It's a birthday card for you.

-You want it?
-Thank you.

that I can't watch a movie with you tonight.

-'Cause I have a date.

-Brad Kessler?

You know what I think of him.
I think he is the world's biggest douche bag.

-To you. Not to me.
-Yes.

Well, of course he is. Look at you!

-It would?
-No, it wouldn't.

It will just... I was just...

-But don't go out with him.
-Why not?

-Well, he's an excellent match for me.
-Well, don't sleep with him.

-Why not?
-What? You were going to?

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.258
If I don't sleep with him,

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.887
then he'll find another acceptable mate
who would sleep with him.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.342
-Then I'll miss out.
-No, he won't.

-Forget about it now. Sorry, I didn't know.

-Yes.

because we're not married.

-Why?

Well, because I was thinking
that if I get eternal happiness when I die,

that'll be really great because it's eternal,

that that's gonna happen.

01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:08.270
Why? Why does it have to be?

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:10.773
Who says your kids will be better than mine?

01:30:10.864 --> 01:30:14.982
Who says that a strong jawline or
a fast metabolism or a muscular physique...

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:16.278
He's also taller.

01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:18.360
No, I know, but I'm just...

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:21.617
Please, man, I...

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:26.084
Who says those traits will make your kids
better than mine, or happier?

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:27.786
I'll love our children.

01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:28.961
And who says you'll make a better husband

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:32.086
just because you come from
a more privileged family

01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:34.338
or a better genetic line?

01:30:34.804 --> 01:30:36.044
(SIGHS)

01:30:36.306 --> 01:30:39.890
She's a prize on your arm.
And your kids will be, too.

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:42.513
Anna.

01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:47.681
If you tell me this is what you really want,
I'll go.

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:51.984
Is this what you really want?

01:30:52.072 --> 01:30:54.734
Well, now, it's not up to us
to decide what we get in life.

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:58.484
-That's up to the man in the sky.
-I'm talking to her.

01:30:59.537 --> 01:31:02.654
Why don't you just ask the man in the sky
what he wants for Anna?

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:05.456
-Surely he knows best.
-She knows what's best.

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:07.659
Just tell her
what the man in the sky wants, Mark.

01:31:07.754 --> 01:31:11.667
Why don't you tell me
what the man in the sky wants for us, Mark?

01:31:11.758 --> 01:31:13.669
Just please tell me.

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:16.217
(SCOFFS)

01:31:16.429 --> 01:31:17.544
No.

01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:26.769
(GUESTS MURMURING)

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.185
(SIGHS)

01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:34.394
Are we married yet?

01:31:34.531 --> 01:31:37.113
-Because I have plans later.
-There's a few...

01:32:02.809 --> 01:32:04.549
ANNA: Mark, wait!

01:32:06.312 --> 01:32:10.100
Why don't you just tell me
what the man in the sky wants?

01:32:11.443 --> 01:32:13.229
-I did a bad thing.
-It's okay.

01:32:13.319 --> 01:32:16.652
-You're allowed three.
-No, you don't understand.

01:32:18.908 --> 01:32:21.069
There is no man in the sky.

01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:27.409
Why did you say there was?

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:34.042
I couldn't stand the look on my mum's face
when she was dying.

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:36.961
And things just escalated.

01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:42.383
But how did you say something that wasn't?

01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:45.637
I don't know, I just did. I just can.

01:32:46.102 --> 01:32:48.218
But when I asked you if being rich

01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:51.601
and successful and famous
changed your genetics,

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:54.224
why didn't you just say yes?

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.436
'Cause it wouldn't count.

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:01.485
Mark.

01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:05.743
I know what I want.

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.115
(SIGHS)

01:33:10.293 --> 01:33:13.080
I want little fat kids with snub noses.

01:33:20.512 --> 01:33:22.002
I'm your man.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.022
MARK: So that's it. I got the girl.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.772
Anna and I are very happy together,
by the way.

01:33:41.866 --> 01:33:45.529
She still doesn't fully understand
how I said or did all those things.

01:33:45.662 --> 01:33:49.496
No one does.
I'm still the only person who can tell a lie.

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:52.787
Actually, that's not entirely true.

01:33:55.713 --> 01:33:57.499
What do you think?

01:33:59.008 --> 01:34:00.714
That looks good.

01:34:03.513 --> 01:34:05.629
It tastes so good, Mom my.

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:08.882
-Your best yet.
-I'm so glad you like it.

01:34:09.394 --> 01:34:10.884
Huh? Oh.

01:34:15.733 --> 01:34:17.974
I don't know where to start.

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:22.820
Just start on the bread, maybe,
then work my way up there.

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:27.735
You eat that. You liked it so much.
Why don't you eat some more?

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:30.449
He loves it.
