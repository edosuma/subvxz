(SYLVIA GRUNTING)

00:55.973 --> 00:58.642
So, uh, hey, I couldn't help but notice,

00:58.725 --> 01:01.603
but you left me alone to deal with all
those Watchdogs. What's that all about?

01:04.523 --> 01:05.607
Still waitin' on an answer.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.486
Sylvia, this is somebody's sock.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.781
That means that there's a sad,
sockless soul out there,

01:12.865 --> 01:19.872
with a very cold, naked foot pining away
for their one lonely sock's twin!

01:19.955 --> 01:23.709
We can't just turn our backs on what could
be someone's greatest hour of need.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.879
Haven't you ever lost something
you wished you could get back?

01:26.962 --> 01:29.590
Besides the last ten
seconds of this conversation?

01:29.673 --> 01:31.550
Come on! It'll be fun!

01:31.633 --> 01:34.803
Besides, how hard can it
be to return a sock?

01:34.887 --> 01:36.263
(SCOFFS) Fine!

01:42.686 --> 01:44.521
Pardon me, miss, but is this your sock?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.857
You got feet? I got a sock!
What a coincidence!

01:49.568 --> 01:51.236
Attention, shoppers!

01:51.320 --> 01:53.572
Is anybody missing a sock?

01:53.780 --> 01:58.452
It's white with two stripes.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.746
It's a sock...

02:00.829 --> 02:02.581
Anybody?

02:02.664 --> 02:04.625
Oh, this is gonna take forever.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.669
If we're gonna do a stupid thing, let's
at least be smart about it!

02:08.086 --> 02:09.254
We'll leave the sock here.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.799
Whoever lost it, will come find it.
It's right there in the title.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.677
I don't know...

02:15.802 --> 02:19.848
what kind of background checks do they
run on people claiming lost items?

02:19.932 --> 02:21.975
Wander, this man is a professional.

02:22.059 --> 02:25.062
He will make sure this precious
cargo finds its way home.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.271
Right?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.942
It'll definitely end up somewhere.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.488
See? "Somewhere!" Hand over the sock.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.038
Gropspeed, little friend!

02:43.121 --> 02:46.625

want to find the owner...

We do! We really do!

Legend tells of the Intergalactic Guru,

02:55.175 --> 03:01.431

answers to every question in the universe.

Ooh!

But, be warned! The journey to the
Guru is fraught with peril!

MAN: Few have survived.

03:08.981 --> 03:13.902
Those who have, were driven to

brave the Grizzly Forest,

03:28.584 --> 03:31.753
so named for its fierce
grizzlock population.

MAN: But beware the less famous, but
equally deadly, Giant Hoarder Scorpion!

03:42.556 --> 03:46.602
There you will find the key
to the Tomb of the Unknown Emperor,

03:48.103 --> 03:52.816
where you will have to tame
the Fierce Tigrex of Nil!

03:55.527 --> 03:59.573
There you shall find a map
leading to the Farbrix Lavadrome.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.953

PRINCESS VERONICRON: Ugh!
Ya call this a rescue?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.237

NEON KNIGHT: Call me, Jim.

04:55.504 --> 04:59.800
MAN: The Neon Knight shall join your
party, but bore you with endless

04:59.883 --> 05:02.177
stories about old fishing trips.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.304
Well, we never thought we'd catch
a snook with that lure.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.181
Now, the thing you gotta
know about your snook...

05:06.265 --> 05:08.016

the Guru only one question

06:13.957 --> 06:16.335
so choose wisely.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.883
O Great and Mighty Intergalactic Guru,

06:22.966 --> 06:25.135
keeper of the wisdom of the cosmos,

06:25.302 --> 06:28.764
grand observer of all that is and will be,

06:29.556 --> 06:30.557
is this your sock?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.769
-Nope.
-Okay, thanks.

06:33.852 --> 06:37.064
"Whose sock is this?" Not "Is this yours?"

06:37.231 --> 06:38.941
"Whose?"!

06:39.024 --> 06:42.152
I'll admit that last
plan was a little... tricky.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.613
But this sock is important to somebody.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.907
We've just got to return it, Sylvia!

06:47.074 --> 06:50.994
No matter how long it takes, how grueling
the journey, how dangerous the...

06:51.078 --> 06:53.080
Oh! Silly me!

06:53.163 --> 06:54.665
This is my sock!

06:54.748 --> 06:56.959
-It is?
-Uh-huh! (GIGGLES)

06:57.042 --> 06:59.753
Where has my head been?
Thanks for returning it!

07:00.003 --> 07:04.758
Hmm... I don't recall you ever
wearing shoes, let alone socks.

Get in there!

07:18.689 --> 07:20.816
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

Look at that! The return address
was inside the sock all along!

07:27.614 --> 07:30.325
(GIGGLING) Isn't that high-larious?

I bet they have a beautiful view!

No! Uh-uh! Wander, we've done a
lot of stupid things to return this sock,

08:11.074 --> 08:13.619
but if we go up there,
we're gonna die!

I can live with stupid,
but I can't live with death.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.248

09:06.046 --> 09:08.131
Excuse me, Mr. Executioner, sir?

09:08.257 --> 09:10.300
Does Destructor have too few socks?

09:10.384 --> 09:12.427
-No.
-Too many, like...

09:12.511 --> 09:13.512
No.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.140
-Has he ever, ever, lost a sock?
-No.

09:17.224 --> 09:21.311
Oh, wait, actually, his horribleness
did lose one sock,

09:21.395 --> 09:22.688
so, he bought a new pair.

09:22.813 --> 09:26.108
I mean, they're just socks.
Well, time to meet your doom. See ya!

09:27.442 --> 09:29.403
Sylvia, I am sorry.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.905
I thought that going out of
your way to be kind to someone,

09:32.030 --> 09:33.740
would always be worth the trouble,

09:33.824 --> 09:36.660
but I was wrong, and you were right.

09:36.743 --> 09:42.833
This is just a dumb sock, and it
doesn't matter a lick to anyone.

09:45.961 --> 09:49.882
No, Wander. This sock does
matter to someone, to you!

09:49.965 --> 09:54.386
And I will not let this entire...
stupid quest be in vain!

important thing in the entire universe!

and make them Dukes!

Huh. So that's what the

-out of this place, huh?
-Aw, do we have to?

14:28.994 --> 14:32.164

not stuck in the middle of nothin'.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.875
Yeah, I guess you're right.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.668

Lift me up. Maybe this
place has a ceiling.

15:05.656 --> 15:08.492
(SCREAMING) Slowly!

15:11.411 --> 15:14.790
(ECHOING) Whoop! Sorry!

15:14.873 --> 15:17.459
(SCREAMING) Quietly!

15:17.793 --> 15:20.963
(WHISPERING) Whoop! Sorry!

15:26.093 --> 15:28.345
Nope! Nothin' up here!

15:43.277 --> 15:44.570
Huh. (GIGGLES)

15:44.695 --> 15:46.738
Sorry, it got really long.

15:46.822 --> 15:49.283
Still comin'. (CHUCKLES)

15:49.366 --> 15:51.326
Anytime, now. Anytime.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.246
Hello!

15:57.749 --> 16:00.377
Okay, no need to panic. No need to panic.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.713
-I'm not,
-But it seems like we're stuck

16:02.796 --> 16:06.925
in an endless void without
any ceilings or walls.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.094
(MUMBLING) Okay, some walls.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.765
Hey!

16:13.849 --> 16:16.268
Help, Wander! I'm trapped!

16:16.560 --> 16:20.522
Hey! That's pretty good!
Look, I'm trapped, too!

16:20.606 --> 16:23.483
No, Wander, I'm really stuck!

16:27.237 --> 16:29.823
(PANTING)

16:29.907 --> 16:31.700
You okay, buddy?

16:31.992 --> 16:36.038
Okay? I was just almost
crushed into a Z-bornak cube!

16:37.080 --> 16:38.457
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

16:38.582 --> 16:42.211
No exit? Fine. We'll just...
blast our way outta here!

16:42.294 --> 16:43.754
Oh, let me help!

16:55.307 --> 16:57.518
(SCREAMING) How was any of that
supposed to help?

16:57.601 --> 17:00.270
Uh, I don't know.
Sure was fun, though, huh?

17:05.317 --> 17:08.153
Wait, what? A door? Of course. A door!

17:13.200 --> 17:14.660
Come on, door!

17:14.785 --> 17:16.620
Get us out of here!

17:19.081 --> 17:21.708
Aw, Sylvia, you're not doin' it right!

17:21.792 --> 17:24.711
You want doors? I'll give ya doors!

17:27.047 --> 17:29.716
I said, "Door, door!"

17:29.800 --> 17:31.260
Whoops! (CHUCKLES)

17:31.343 --> 17:33.762
Well, gotta be one of these, right?

17:33.846 --> 17:35.514
(GRUNTING)

17:54.575 --> 17:57.661
Oh! Okay, okay!
You're the right door! Right?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.830
I have a good feeling about this one.

17:59.955 --> 18:02.541
I didn't trust those other doors.
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

18:02.624 --> 18:05.878
Okay. Thinkin' spacey thoughts.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.171
And...

18:23.395 --> 18:26.815
SQUID: I just want to sell
you some insurance!

18:26.899 --> 18:28.984
(GROANING) No thank you!

18:31.737 --> 18:33.530
Wander!

18:33.614 --> 18:37.701
Sorry, but come on, giant squid
insurance? Kind of funny, right?

18:38.118 --> 18:41.121
Wander. This place
will give us whatever we want!

18:41.205 --> 18:45.792
(EXCITEDLY) I know!
Isn't it awesome?

18:48.128 --> 18:51.632
Yeah, but I don't think we're
gonna get to leave,

18:51.715 --> 18:53.550
until we both want to leave.

18:54.927 --> 19:00.390
So, do you think, for me, you can focus,
so we can get back to our world?

19:00.474 --> 19:04.144
A-zooma-wimmy-zimmy-zoob-zoob!

19:05.562 --> 19:06.897
Yes!

19:09.191 --> 19:13.862
I knew you could do it, buddy! No crazy
fantasy void is gonna keep us locked up!

19:13.946 --> 19:20.202
Watch out, universe, 'cause
Wander and Sylvia are back in action?

19:21.328 --> 19:23.455
Hm. That's weird

ever wanna leave this place?
