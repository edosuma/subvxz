01:17.581 --> 01:20.548
YOU'RE SURE THIS
TURTLEPOX THE BOYS HAVE

01:20.549 --> 01:22.783
ISN'T CATCHING, SPLINTER?

01:22.784 --> 01:24.084
QUITE SURE, APRIL.

01:24.085 --> 01:28.420
IT IS A VERY RARE
DISEASE THAT AFFECTS
ONLY MUTANT TURTLES.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.421
OH, I FEEL LIKE
THE TECHNODROME

01:30.422 --> 01:31.823
JUST ROLLED
OVER ME.

01:34.325 --> 01:35.592
HERE, HAVE SOME
CHICKEN SOUP.

01:35.593 --> 01:38.094
IT'LL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

01:39.161 --> 01:41.696
OH, AT LEAST IT
WOULD HAVE.

01:44.432 --> 01:46.532
HERE, MICHELANGELO.
TRY THIS.

01:46.533 --> 01:50.068
OH, APRIL,
WHAT I REALLY WANTED

01:50.069 --> 01:53.003
WAS A TEA AND TOAST
PIZZA.

01:53.004 --> 01:55.237
IT'S SO NICE OF YOU
TO LOOK AFTER US

01:55.238 --> 01:57.439
WHILE WE'RE SICK,
APRIL.

01:57.440 --> 02:01.308
BY THE WAY,
THIS SOUP IS COLD.

02:01.309 --> 02:03.243
COULD YOU
WARM IT UP AGAIN?

02:03.244 --> 02:05.978
APRIL, CAN I HAVE
A GLASS OF WATER?

02:05.979 --> 02:08.479
COULD YOU GET ME
ANOTHER BLANKET?

02:08.481 --> 02:10.781
TELL ME A STORY.

02:10.782 --> 02:13.716
AHH, FOR A BUNCH OF
HEROES ON THE HALF SHELL,

02:13.717 --> 02:16.217
THEY CAN BE
REAL BABIES!

02:16.218 --> 02:18.620
THERE IT IS,
SHREDDER.

02:18.621 --> 02:20.387
THE INVENTION
THAT'LL PUT AN END

02:20.388 --> 02:23.489
TO THOSE ACCURSED
TURTLES AT LAST...

02:23.490 --> 02:25.657
METALHEAD!

02:25.658 --> 02:26.391
WHAT IS IT?

02:26.392 --> 02:27.391
IT'S A ROBOT,

02:27.392 --> 02:29.827
WHICH I INTEND
TO PROGRAM WITH

02:29.828 --> 02:33.395
THE TURTLES' OWN
NINJA FIGHTING SKILLS.

02:33.396 --> 02:36.297
THAT, COMBINED
WITH ITS BUILT-IN
WEAPONRY,

02:36.298 --> 02:38.566
WILL MAKE IT
UNSTOPPABLE.

02:38.567 --> 02:39.800
WATCH.

02:45.371 --> 02:48.104
IN ORDER
TO PROGRAM THE ROBOT,

02:48.105 --> 02:50.940
I WILL NEED COMPLETE
BRAIN WAVE SCANS

02:50.941 --> 02:52.508
OF ALL THE TURTLES.

02:52.509 --> 02:54.476
YOU MUST GO
TO THE SURFACE

02:54.477 --> 02:56.477
WITH THIS PORTABLE
BRAINALYZER,

02:56.478 --> 02:58.978
AND GET THEM FOR ME.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.282
JUST ONCE I'D LIKE
YOU TO SURFACE

03:05.283 --> 03:06.718
WHERE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.

03:06.719 --> 03:10.720
YOU--YOU SAID YOU
WANTED A SOFT LANDING.

03:10.721 --> 03:13.555
SOFT. NOT OVERRIPE.

03:13.556 --> 03:15.056
NOW PAY ATTENTION.

03:15.057 --> 03:17.558
I NEED YOU CRETINS
TO LURE THE TURTLES

03:17.559 --> 03:19.058
OUT OF HIDING

03:19.059 --> 03:21.493
SO I CAN USE
THIS BRAINALYZER
ON THEM.

03:21.494 --> 03:25.530
UH, MAYBE WE OUGHTA
TEST IT OUT FIRST, BOSS.

03:25.531 --> 03:29.599
YEAH. IF WE
ONLY HAD A BRAIN.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.334
I'VE BEEN SAYING
THAT ABOUT YOU TWO
FOR YEARS.

03:34.470 --> 03:36.302
UH, I DON'T GET IT, BOSS.

03:36.303 --> 03:39.372
WHY ARE WE BREAKING
INTO THIS JOINT?

03:39.373 --> 03:41.140
THE TURTLES
WILL THINK YOU'RE
STEALING EQUIPMENT

03:41.141 --> 03:42.474
FOR THE TECHNODROME,

03:42.475 --> 03:44.142
AND SHOW UP
TO STOP YOU.

03:44.143 --> 03:45.476
AND WHEN THEY DO,

03:45.477 --> 03:47.143
I'LL BE READY
FOR THEM.

03:47.144 --> 03:50.212
NOW GET IN THERE
AND DO YOUR WORST.

03:50.213 --> 03:54.215
OOH, THE WORST
IS WHAT WE DO BEST.

03:57.751 --> 03:59.685
YOU, THERE. STOP!

03:59.686 --> 04:01.320
HIT THE ROAD, JACK.

04:01.321 --> 04:04.488
BEFORE THE ROAD
HITS YOU. HYAH!

04:05.923 --> 04:07.323
OH, THEY DON'T
PAY ME ENOUGH

04:07.324 --> 04:09.258
TO TAKE THIS ABUSE.
[ALARM RINGING]

04:11.160 --> 04:13.360
EVERYTHING'S
WORKING PERFECTLY, KRANG.

04:13.361 --> 04:15.362
CHANNEL 6 WILL PROVIDE
LIVE COVERAGE

04:15.363 --> 04:17.329
OF THIS BREAK-IN
MOMENTARILY,

04:17.331 --> 04:19.298
AND THAT WILL
BRING THE TURTLES.

04:19.298 --> 04:24.167
EXCELLENT!
FOR ONCE THINGS ARE
GOING AS PLANNED.

04:28.338 --> 04:30.905
APRIL, HOW IS IT
THAT YOU'RE NOT

04:30.906 --> 04:32.706
WATCHING THE NEWS
ON TELEVISION?

04:32.707 --> 04:35.208
I WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT
WAKE UP THE GUYS.

04:39.845 --> 04:41.113
TRUST ME.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.480
IN THEIR CONDITION,
NOTHING WILL
AWAKEN THEM.

04:45.982 --> 04:48.450
WHY ISN'T APRIL
HERE TO COVER THIS?

04:48.451 --> 04:49.518
SHE'S SO MUCH BETTER

04:49.519 --> 04:51.485
IN THESE
EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.

04:51.486 --> 04:53.953
NOT THAT I'D EVER
TELL HER, OF COURSE.

04:53.954 --> 04:56.555
WHAT'S KEEPING
THOSE BLASTED TURTLES?

04:56.556 --> 04:58.057
THEY SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HERE BY NOW.

05:01.525 --> 05:04.326
IS THIS FUN OR WHAT?

05:05.762 --> 05:07.695
UH, WHAT'S UP, BOSS?

05:07.696 --> 05:09.564
ARE THE TURTLES HERE?

05:09.565 --> 05:11.998
NO, BUT THE POLICE ARE.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.499
YOU BETTER
GET OUT OF THERE.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.534
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER WAY

05:14.535 --> 05:16.568
TO LURE THE TURTLES
OUT OF HIDING.

05:16.569 --> 05:19.303
GEE, MAYBE THE TURTLES
DON'T THINK

05:19.304 --> 05:22.639
WE'RE IMPORTANT ENOUGH
TO BEAT UP ANYMORE.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.807
THAT WOUNDS ME DEEPLY.

05:25.808 --> 05:28.309
HMM. WE'RE OUT
OF CHICKEN SOUP.

05:28.310 --> 05:30.844
I GUESS I BETTER
GO BUY SOME MORE.

05:30.845 --> 05:32.845
GO ROB
THAT BANK.

05:32.846 --> 05:34.913
THAT WILL GRAB
THE TURTLES'
ATTENTION.

05:34.914 --> 05:36.548
A BANK!

05:36.549 --> 05:38.949
WE'RE MOVING
UP IN THE WORLD.

05:38.950 --> 05:43.820
YEAH, THE MOST WE EVER
USED TO ROB WAS MINIMARTS.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.821
OH, GREAT.

05:46.822 --> 05:48.355
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS SAFE

05:48.356 --> 05:50.556
TO COME OUT
OF THE SEWERS.

05:53.392 --> 05:54.392
WAKE UP, GUYS!

05:54.393 --> 05:55.726
ROCK STEADY
AND BEBOP

05:55.727 --> 05:58.362
ARE ROBBING
THE METROCORP BANK.

05:58.363 --> 06:00.898
OH, I MUST BE
HAVING A FEVER DREAM.

06:00.899 --> 06:01.897
IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU SAID

06:01.898 --> 06:04.733
BEBOP AND ROCKSTEADY
WERE ROBBING A BANK.

06:04.734 --> 06:07.334
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I DID SAY.

06:07.335 --> 06:10.102
BOY, TALK ABOUT
LOUSY TIMING.

06:11.438 --> 06:15.473
YEAH, I'M TOTALLY BUMMED.

06:15.474 --> 06:17.341
SICK OR NOT

06:17.342 --> 06:19.876
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO CAN STOP THEM.

06:23.245 --> 06:25.412
HEY, THIS IS FUN.

06:25.413 --> 06:27.848
LET'S DO SOME
MORE CRIMES.

06:27.849 --> 06:29.182
OOH, OOH!
BETTER YET,

06:29.183 --> 06:31.851
LET'S ORDER PIZZA
AND NOT PAY FOR IT.

06:33.085 --> 06:34.886
YOU'D BETTER HOPE
THEY DELIVER

06:34.887 --> 06:36.887
IN THE SLAMMER,
HAMHEAD.

06:36.888 --> 06:38.387
THIS IS IT.

06:38.388 --> 06:40.222
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.

06:42.158 --> 06:45.826
OH, BOY, DO I
HAVE A HEADACHE
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

06:45.827 --> 06:48.061
YEAH. FEELS LIKE
A HEAVY METAL CONCERT

06:48.062 --> 06:50.196
GOING ON IN MY HEAD.

06:50.197 --> 06:53.031
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
THE EFFECTS OF
THE TURTLEPOX.

06:53.032 --> 06:54.598
ROCKSTEADY, BEBOP.

06:54.599 --> 06:56.666
GET BACK TO
THE TRANSPORT MODULE.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.834
I HAVE WHAT I CAME FOR.

06:58.835 --> 07:03.037
AW, JUST WHEN THINGS
WAS GETTING INTERESTING.

07:03.038 --> 07:04.705
THEY'RE
GETTING AWAY!

07:04.706 --> 07:06.507
WE'D BETTER DO THE SAME.

07:06.508 --> 07:07.840
I DON'T GET IT.

07:07.841 --> 07:09.941
IT'S NOT LIKE
ROCKSTEADY AND BEBOP

07:09.942 --> 07:11.610
TO BACK AWAY
FROM A FIGHT!

07:11.611 --> 07:13.277
WELL, MAYBE
THEY'RE SICK, TOO.

07:14.446 --> 07:16.446
OH, COME ON BACK TO
THE HIDEOUT, GUYS.

07:16.447 --> 07:18.180
I'LL FIX SOME MORE
CHICKEN SOUP.

07:18.181 --> 07:20.982
WAIT, I-IF--
IF I EAT ANYMORE
CHICKEN SOUP,

07:20.983 --> 07:23.783
I'LL BE THE ONLY TURTLE
ON EARTH WITH FEATHERS.

07:25.353 --> 07:26.986
IT WORKS.

07:26.987 --> 07:28.854
I PROGRAMMED A ROBOT

07:28.855 --> 07:31.289
WITH THE TURTLES'
NINJA SKILLS.

07:31.290 --> 07:33.390
I'LL BELIEVE THAT
WHEN I SEE IT.

07:33.391 --> 07:34.558
GLADLY.

07:34.559 --> 07:36.359
ROCKSTEADY, BEBOP.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.659
ATTACK THE ROBOT.

07:38.660 --> 07:41.828
READY OR NOT,
HERE WE COME.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.630
WE'LL SEND
THAT TIN TURTLE

07:43.631 --> 07:45.131
TO THE SCRAP HEAP.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.469
HMM, I'M IMPRESSED.

07:51.470 --> 07:55.037
IT'S EVERYTHING
I HOPED IT WOULD BE.

07:55.038 --> 07:57.039
AGAINST THIS
FIGHTING MACHINE,

07:57.040 --> 08:00.541
THE TURTLES DON'T
STAND A CHANCE.

08:07.780 --> 08:10.981
OH, MAN, I AM ONE
TUCKERED-OUT TURTLE.

08:12.516 --> 08:13.716
BE PATIENT.

08:13.717 --> 08:15.984
THE FEVER SHOULD
SUBSIDE BY TOMORROW.

08:15.985 --> 08:17.985
UHH, I STILL
CAN'T FIGURE OUT

08:17.986 --> 08:20.388
WHAT SHREDDER
AND HIS GOONS
WERE UP TO.

08:20.389 --> 08:22.322
OH, HEY, WHAT'S THE DIFF?

08:22.323 --> 08:25.057
AS LONG AS WE CHASED THEM
BACK UNDERGROUND.

08:25.058 --> 08:26.991
I HOPE THEY HAVE
INDEED GIVEN UP

08:26.992 --> 08:29.826
AS EASILY AS YOU SAY,
MICHELANGELO.

08:29.827 --> 08:31.528
ALL RIGHT, ROBOT.

08:31.529 --> 08:34.895
TIME TO FULFILL
YOUR PRIMARY FUNCTION.

08:34.897 --> 08:38.332
SEEK AND DESTROY
THE TURTLES.

08:38.332 --> 08:41.333
DOES IT KNOW
HOW TO PILOT
A TRANSPORT MODULE?

08:41.335 --> 08:43.336
IT HAS NO NEED OF ONE.

08:43.337 --> 08:47.238
IT CAN DRILL ITS WAY
TO THE SURFACE BY ITSELF.

08:47.239 --> 08:48.773
AND BEST OF ALL,

08:48.774 --> 08:51.508
ITS REMOTE CAMERA
WILL LET US WATCH

08:51.509 --> 08:53.676
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE TURTLES

08:53.677 --> 08:57.579
FROM THE COMFORT
OF THE TECHNODROME.

08:57.580 --> 09:01.179
<i>SOUNDS GOOD, IF IT
DOESN'T BLOW A FUSE.</i>

09:01.180 --> 09:05.150
IT BETTER NOT,
OR I'LL BLOW MY FUSE.

09:05.151 --> 09:08.819
OH! WELL,
THE TURTLES ARE
ALL TUCKED IN AGAIN

09:08.820 --> 09:11.254
FOR A LONG NAP,
I HOPE.

09:11.255 --> 09:13.522
PERHAPS THINGS
WILL BE QUIET
FOR A TIME.

09:18.126 --> 09:19.926
YOU WANT TO BET?

09:19.927 --> 09:22.428
WHAT MANNER
OF CREATION
IS THIS?

09:22.429 --> 09:23.828
WHATEVER IT IS,

09:23.829 --> 09:25.930
IT DOESN'T LOOK
TOO FRIENDLY.

09:32.268 --> 09:34.868
IT MERELY
SHRUGGED OFF

09:34.869 --> 09:37.305
MY MOST POWERFUL KICK.

09:37.306 --> 09:39.105
WHAT DO
WE DO NOW?

09:39.106 --> 09:41.673
A WISE MAN KNOWS WHEN
HE IS OUTCLASSED, APRIL.

09:41.674 --> 09:43.340
I SUGGEST WE FALL BACK

09:43.341 --> 09:45.710
TO A MORE
STRATEGIC POSITION.

09:45.711 --> 09:48.412
IN OTHER WORDS,
WE RUN LIKE HECK!

09:48.413 --> 09:49.511
PRECISELY.

09:53.949 --> 09:55.482
I CAN'T MOVE!

09:55.483 --> 09:58.718
THAT MACHINE SEEMS
TO HAVE TIED US UP.

09:58.719 --> 10:01.152
SO MUCH FOR
THE STRATEGIC RETREAT.

10:01.153 --> 10:02.554
YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER IDEAS?

10:02.555 --> 10:04.955
OH, WHAT'S
ALL THE NOISE?

10:06.223 --> 10:07.323
WHAT IS IT?

10:07.324 --> 10:10.024
HE LOOKS LIKE
A GIANT TURTLE.

10:10.025 --> 10:11.159
BE CAREFUL, MY STUDENTS.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.661
YOU ARE PITTED
AGAINST A SUPERIOR
FIGHTING MACHINE.

10:14.662 --> 10:16.463
THAT DOESN'T SCARE US.

10:16.464 --> 10:17.930
I AM METALHEAD.

10:17.931 --> 10:21.232
I CRUSH TURTLES.

10:21.233 --> 10:22.901
NOW, THAT SCARES US.

10:22.902 --> 10:25.736
TURTLES FIGHT WITH HONOR!

10:31.240 --> 10:34.807
YEAH! BUT THIS
DUDE FIGHTS
WITH EVERYTHING!

10:34.808 --> 10:37.342
HE SEEMS TO KNOW
JUST WHAT WE'RE THINKING.

10:37.343 --> 10:38.877
AND BEFORE WE DO.

10:40.013 --> 10:42.479
EH! NO FAIR, DUDE!

10:46.416 --> 10:48.683
MASTER SPLINTER
IS RIGHT.

10:48.684 --> 10:50.919
THIS THING IS
ONE JUMP AHEAD
OF US.

10:52.086 --> 10:55.788
I TOLD YOU MY ROBOT
COULD DEFEAT THEM.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.922
GOOD, NOW HAVE IT
FINISH THEM OFF

10:57.923 --> 10:59.791
BEFORE THEY HAVE
A CHANCE TO ESCAPE.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.224
NOT SO FAST.

11:01.225 --> 11:05.695
I WANT THEM BROUGHT
BACK TO THE TECHNODROME.

11:05.696 --> 11:08.296
SO YOU CAN PERSONALLY
DISPOSE OF THEM?

11:08.297 --> 11:10.031
EXACTLY.

11:10.032 --> 11:12.933
FIRST, I INTEND
TO SLICE AND DICE,

11:12.934 --> 11:15.767
THEN PARBOIL
AND FRICASSEE THEM

11:15.768 --> 11:19.337
WITH JUST A TOUCH
OF CILANTRO.

11:19.338 --> 11:22.673
OH, YOU PAINT SUCH
A PRETTY PICTURE.

11:24.908 --> 11:26.607
OH, WE COULDA WHIPPED
THIS METALHEAD

11:26.608 --> 11:28.409
IF WE ALL
WEREN'T SO SICK.

11:28.410 --> 11:31.078
HE'S GOTTA BE ONE
OF KRANG'S INVENTIONS.

11:31.079 --> 11:32.945
HE MUST'VE FOUND
A WAY TO PROGRAM HIM

11:32.946 --> 11:34.980
WITH OUR NINJA SKILLS.

11:34.981 --> 11:37.281
THAT DOESN'T GIVE US
MUCH OF A CHANCE,
DOES IT?

11:37.282 --> 11:38.916
WELL, JUST ONE.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.785
IF I CAN MATCH
HIS FREQUENCY
PHASE AMPLITUDE,

11:41.786 --> 11:45.220
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO DEMODULATE HIS
CYBERNETIC SYNAPSES.

11:45.221 --> 11:46.754
MOST EXCELLENT, DUDE.

11:46.755 --> 11:50.089
I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING MYSELF.

11:50.090 --> 11:51.456
YEAH. WANNA
RUN THAT BY US

11:51.457 --> 11:53.225
ONE MORE TIME, DONATELLO?

11:53.226 --> 11:54.458
WELL, ALL I SAID WAS,

11:54.459 --> 11:56.127
MAYBE I COULD
USE THE TURTLECOM

11:56.128 --> 11:58.061
TO SHORT CIRCUIT
HIS MEMORY BANKS.

11:58.062 --> 12:00.429
SO, LIKE, WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR, BUD?

12:01.532 --> 12:04.232
THESE HIGH FREQUENCY
OSCILLATIONS OUGHTA DO IT.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.969
IT'S WORKING!
KEEP IT UP!

12:12.138 --> 12:15.039
HE'S GONE WACKAZOID!

12:19.644 --> 12:23.211
THAT'LL TEACH
HIM TO PICK ON
4 SICK TURTLES.

12:24.547 --> 12:26.380
COME ON. LET'S GET HIM
BACK TO THE LAIR.

12:26.381 --> 12:28.081
MAYBE I CAN REPROGRAM HIM.

12:28.082 --> 12:31.449
OK, JUST DON'T
USE THE STEREO
FOR SPARE PARTS.

12:37.354 --> 12:39.489
WELL,
ROCKSTEADY,

12:39.490 --> 12:42.424
YOU ACTUALLY GOT
US HERE WITHOUT
ANY FOUL-UPS.

12:42.425 --> 12:44.359
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

12:44.360 --> 12:48.561
THE BOSS
ACTUALLY SHOWERED ME
WITH COMPLIMENTS.

12:52.231 --> 12:54.164
HEY, YOU AIN'T
THE ONLY ONE

12:54.165 --> 12:56.133
WHO'S GETTING A SHOWER.

12:56.134 --> 12:59.569
THIS IS WHERE KRANG SAID
THE ROBOT WOULD MEET US.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.936
WHERE IS THAT
WRETCHED INVENTION?

13:01.937 --> 13:04.071
AW, LOOK, BOSS.

13:04.072 --> 13:08.007
THAT OIL SLICK MUST BE
ALL THAT'S LEFT OF HIM.

13:08.008 --> 13:10.342
BLAST! I WARNED KRANG

13:10.343 --> 13:12.276
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
MIGHT HAPPEN.

13:12.277 --> 13:13.611
THE GOOD PART IS

13:13.612 --> 13:15.645
WE CAN FOLLOW
THIS TRAIL OF OIL

13:15.646 --> 13:17.747
AND FIND THE TURTLES.

13:24.052 --> 13:25.019
HERE, FELLAS.

13:25.020 --> 13:26.719
I BROUGHT YOU
SOME MORE CHICKEN SOUP.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.386
MORE CHICKEN SOUP?

13:28.387 --> 13:30.255
READY, GUYS?

13:32.958 --> 13:34.590
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

13:34.591 --> 13:37.359
AT LEAST
THAT ROBOT WON'T BE
BOTHERING US ANYMORE.

13:39.495 --> 13:43.263
OH, BUMMER. NOT AGAIN.

13:55.305 --> 13:56.672
NOT TO WORRY, GANG.

13:56.673 --> 13:59.907
I'VE DEPROGRAMMED HIM,
THEN REPROGRAMMED HIM.

13:59.908 --> 14:02.476
METALHEAD,
MEET THE TURTLES.

14:02.477 --> 14:03.609
HEY, HERMANO,

14:03.610 --> 14:05.811
HOW'S IT GOING, DUDE?

14:05.812 --> 14:08.612
HUH? HOW COME
THIS ROBOT REPTILE

14:08.613 --> 14:11.514
SOUNDS EXACTLY
LIKE YOURS TRULY?

14:11.515 --> 14:14.049
NICE PLACE, GUYS.
WHO'S YOUR DECORATOR,

14:14.050 --> 14:15.785
THE PHANTOM
OF THE OPERA?

14:15.786 --> 14:17.284
WRONG, MICHELANGELO.

14:17.285 --> 14:19.853
H-HE SOUNDS
EXACTLY LIKE ME.

14:19.854 --> 14:22.622
NO, I DON'T.
I SOUND LIKE HIM,

14:22.623 --> 14:25.124
EXCEPT WHEN I SOUND
LIKE HIM--

14:25.125 --> 14:26.024
OR HIM--

14:26.025 --> 14:27.526
I MEAN, HIM.
NO, YOU DON'T!

14:27.527 --> 14:29.059
WHO AM I NOW?

14:29.060 --> 14:30.960
PERSONALITY
OVERLOAD!

14:30.961 --> 14:32.529
DIVE! DIVE!

14:34.864 --> 14:36.398
THERE ARE STILL

14:36.399 --> 14:37.999
A FEW BUGS
TO WORK OUT.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.632
SINCE METALHEAD
WAS PROGRAMMED

14:39.633 --> 14:41.368
WITH ALL OUR
PERSONALITIES,

14:41.369 --> 14:43.669
HE GETS A LITTLE
CONFUSED SOMETIMES.

14:43.670 --> 14:46.838
GREAT.
A SCHIZOPHRENIC ROBOT.

14:46.839 --> 14:49.072
OH, HE'S WORSE
THAN SCHIZOPHRENIC.

14:49.073 --> 14:51.040
HE'S QUADROPHRENIC!

14:51.041 --> 14:53.609
WARNING! WARNING!
SENSORS INDICATE

14:53.610 --> 14:56.044
SHREDDER, BEBOP, AND
ROCKSTEADY APPROACHING!

14:56.045 --> 14:59.046
HEY, MAN. THEY'RE MONDO
CLOSE, TOO.

14:59.047 --> 15:02.215
OH, NO.
SHREDDER'S GONNA
FIND OUR HIDEOUT.

15:02.216 --> 15:03.882
THERE GOES
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

15:03.883 --> 15:06.050
MY INSTINCTS TELL ME

15:06.051 --> 15:08.384
THAT WE'RE VERY CLOSE
TO THE TURTLES' LAIR.

15:08.385 --> 15:11.853
THIS TIME WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE SOME TURTLE HASH.

15:11.854 --> 15:14.021
WAIT. I SENSE SOMETHING.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.358
THE TURTLES!

15:19.994 --> 15:23.128
CATCH US IF YOU CAN,
SHRED MAN.

15:24.430 --> 15:26.731
QUICKLY! AFTER THEM!

15:26.732 --> 15:28.430
RIGHT, BOSS.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.401
IDIOTS!

15:36.404 --> 15:40.339
OH, THIS'LL BE
LIKE SHOOTING
DUCKS IN A BARREL.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.908
OR BETTER YET,
TURTLES IN A SEWER.

15:50.147 --> 15:52.681
KRANG!
COME IN, KRANG!

15:52.682 --> 15:54.715
THIS BETTER
BE IMPORTANT!

15:54.716 --> 15:58.251
YOU'RE INTERRUPTING
MY EXERCISE PROGRAM.

15:58.252 --> 16:01.120
GOOD NEWS.
WE'RE IN PURSUIT
OF THE TURTLES

16:01.121 --> 16:03.554
WITH THE HELP
OF YOUR ROBOT.

16:03.555 --> 16:04.655
WHAT IN BLAZES?

16:06.124 --> 16:09.958
HEY, I THOUGHT THIS
THING WAS ON OUR SIDE.

16:09.959 --> 16:12.794
YOUR ROBOT IS
SHOOTING AT US.

16:12.795 --> 16:15.028
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

16:15.029 --> 16:17.029
GOTTA HAND IT
TO YOU, LEONARDO,

16:17.030 --> 16:19.163
HAVING METALHEAD
PRETEND TO CHASE US

16:19.164 --> 16:20.231
WAS BRILLIANT.

16:20.232 --> 16:22.633
OK, WE'RE FAR ENOUGH
FROM OUR LAIR NOW.

16:22.634 --> 16:24.668
LET'S GO TOPSIDE.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.806
UHH, THIS WOULDN'T
BE ANY FUN,

16:31.807 --> 16:33.407
EVEN IF I WERE WELL.

16:33.408 --> 16:36.742
HERE COME
THE PARTY ANIMALS.

16:36.743 --> 16:38.811
WHERE
ARE THOSE TURTLES?

16:38.812 --> 16:41.212
I'LL PULVERIZE THEM!

16:43.314 --> 16:44.314
SCUSE ME!

16:44.315 --> 16:45.481
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT!

16:45.482 --> 16:47.049
NO TIME TO CHAT!
GOOD-BYE.

16:47.050 --> 16:48.950
GOT TO CATCH
THOSE TURTLES.

16:48.951 --> 16:52.186
CATCH THIS,
STEEL SHELL.

16:52.187 --> 16:53.220
NO!

16:53.221 --> 16:54.721
STOP, YOU FOOL!

17:00.859 --> 17:03.327
I FEEL SO FUNKY.

17:03.328 --> 17:06.194
I GOT TO BLAST
THOSE TURTLES.

17:06.195 --> 17:09.030
WAIT. I HAVE TO BLAST
SHREDDER.

17:09.031 --> 17:11.865
OR IS IT THE TURTLES?
I'M SO CONFUSED.

17:11.866 --> 17:15.000
MAYBE I'LL JUST
BLAST EVERYBODY!

17:19.637 --> 17:21.137
BEBOP, YOU IDIOT!

17:21.137 --> 17:24.240
YOU'VE CAUSED
THE ROBOT TO GO
COMPLETELY HAYWIRE.

17:24.241 --> 17:25.607
YEAH.

17:25.608 --> 17:28.609
PRETTY SMOOTH,
PORK LIPS.

17:28.610 --> 17:30.977
BOGUS MOVE!

17:30.978 --> 17:33.579
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE SHOOTING AT US!

17:33.580 --> 17:35.046
GOING UP.

17:37.883 --> 17:39.650
WE'VE GOT TO SHUT
METALHEAD DOWN

17:39.651 --> 17:42.285
BEFORE HE TURNS US
INTO TURTLE TOAST!

17:42.286 --> 17:45.087
PRIMO NOTION,
FEARLESS LEADER,

17:45.088 --> 17:46.755
BUT HOW ARE
WE GONNA THAT?

17:46.756 --> 17:49.023
I'VE GOT AN IDEA. LOOK!

17:49.024 --> 17:50.523
THE CHANNEL 6 BUILDING?

17:50.524 --> 17:52.191
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO RIG UP

17:52.192 --> 17:53.458
SOME OF
THE BROADCASTING EQUIPMENT

17:53.459 --> 17:55.393
TO DEACTIVATE METALHEAD.

17:55.394 --> 17:57.095
GOOD. TAKE APRIL
WITH YOU.

17:57.096 --> 17:59.529
IT'S GETTING TOO HOT HERE!

17:59.530 --> 18:01.431
WE'LL DEAL
WITH METALHEAD.

18:02.432 --> 18:04.533
OH, SHREDDER AND
HIS GOONS ARE BELOW US.

18:04.534 --> 18:07.901
WE'LL TAKE THE AERIAL ROUTE.
FOLLOW ME.

18:07.902 --> 18:11.904
ME ON THAT THING?
YOU MUST BE KIDDING.

18:11.905 --> 18:14.239
APRIL! WAIT!

18:14.240 --> 18:16.306
GOING DOWN, AMIGO.

18:17.675 --> 18:20.376
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.783
DONATELLO!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:29.784 --> 18:31.717
IF I WERE A CAT,

18:31.718 --> 18:33.618
I'D HAVE JUST
LOST ABOUT 8 LIVES.

18:33.619 --> 18:35.620
HOW'D YOU GET
DOWN FROM THERE?

18:35.621 --> 18:37.520
I TOOK THE STAIRS.

18:37.521 --> 18:39.521
COME ON!
NOW, LET'S TAKE
THE GROUND ROUTE.

18:39.522 --> 18:40.556
OH, RIGHT.

18:40.557 --> 18:43.659
AIR TRAVEL DOES NOT
AGREE WITH ME.

18:43.660 --> 18:44.724
THE TURTLES
ARE UP THERE!

18:44.725 --> 18:45.960
GO GET THEM!

18:45.961 --> 18:49.695
BUT, BOSS, W-WHAT ABOUT
THAT WHACKED-OUT ROBOT?

18:49.696 --> 18:51.363
YEAH.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.864
YOU WANT HIM
TO GET MAD AT US?

18:53.865 --> 18:55.199
BELIEVE ME.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.700
BETTER HIM
MAD AT YOU
THAN ME!

18:58.701 --> 19:01.635
<i>SINCE YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY.</i>

19:04.273 --> 19:06.572
HURRY. MAYBE WE
CAN SNEAK YOU
UP TO THE TRANSMITTER

19:06.573 --> 19:08.174
BEFORE ANYONE SEES YOU.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.009
IT'S BURNE AND VERNON.

19:11.010 --> 19:13.177
QUICK! HIDE BEHIND
THIS THING.

19:13.178 --> 19:15.812
APRIL. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

19:15.813 --> 19:17.814
I THOUGHT IT WAS
YOUR DAY OFF.

19:17.815 --> 19:19.914
YOU KNOW ME, CHIEF.

19:19.915 --> 19:21.582
I CAN'T STAY AWAY
FROM THIS PLACE.

19:23.452 --> 19:24.818
WHO SNEEZED?

19:24.819 --> 19:26.419
UH...OH, SORRY.

19:26.420 --> 19:29.455
I-I MUST BE
CATCHING A COLD.

19:29.456 --> 19:30.421
OH, I HAVEN'T SEEN

19:30.422 --> 19:33.123
THOSE TROUBLESOME
TURTLE FRIENDS
OF YOURS LATELY.

19:33.124 --> 19:34.924
OH, YOU KNOW THEM.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.925
THEY COULD
BE ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.261
BAD NEWS, AMIGOS.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.529
WE'RE TRAPPED
LIKE...LIKE...

19:41.530 --> 19:42.596
RATS?

19:42.597 --> 19:44.997
I WAS GOING
TO SAY TURTLES!

19:44.998 --> 19:46.298
SAYONARA, TURTLES.

19:46.299 --> 19:48.266
WAIT. I CAN'T DO THIS.

19:48.267 --> 19:50.535
THE TURTLES ARE
MY FRIENDS.

19:50.536 --> 19:52.736
OR IS SHREDDER MY FRIEND?

19:52.737 --> 19:55.971
OH, BUMMER. LIKE,
I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED.

19:55.972 --> 19:57.573
OH, YEAH?

19:57.574 --> 20:00.175
WELL, WE
AIN'T CONFUSED.

20:00.176 --> 20:04.310
SAY BYE-BYE,
YOU GREEN GEEKS!

20:04.311 --> 20:05.978
WELL, DO YOU
HAVE IT WORKING?

20:05.979 --> 20:07.646
WE'LL KNOW IN A SECOND.

20:07.647 --> 20:09.714
HERE GOES.

20:13.050 --> 20:15.284
IT'S ALL
SO CLEAR TO ME NOW.

20:15.285 --> 20:17.786
THE TURTLES
ARE MY FRIENDS.

20:17.787 --> 20:20.287
AND YOU BOZOS AREN'T!

20:24.324 --> 20:26.792
TIME TO BEAT
A DISCREET RETREAT.

20:36.232 --> 20:37.298
YO, DUDES.

20:37.299 --> 20:39.066
TIME TO GET
OUR SHELLS IN GEAR.

20:39.067 --> 20:41.001
GOOD JOB, DONATELLO.

20:41.002 --> 20:43.169
METALHEAD'S
WORKING FINE AGAIN.

20:44.136 --> 20:45.236
DADDY!

20:45.237 --> 20:47.705
WE'D BETTER GET HIM
BACK IN THE SEWERS

20:47.706 --> 20:50.306
BEFORE SOMETHING ELSE
GOES WRONG.

20:50.307 --> 20:52.775
OH, MAN. AM I GLAD
THAT'S OVER.

20:52.776 --> 20:54.810
YEAH, NOW WE
CAN GET BACK

20:54.811 --> 20:57.211
INTO BEING SERIOUSLY SICK.

20:58.846 --> 21:00.614
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF FUN

21:00.615 --> 21:03.415
WITH APRIL WAITING
ON US HAND AND FOOT.

21:03.416 --> 21:06.183
SORRY, FELLAS.
NO MORE NURSING.

21:06.184 --> 21:08.319
I'VE GOTTA GET BACK
TO CHANNEL 6.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.987
WHAT? BUT WHO'S GOING
TO LOOK AFTER US

21:10.988 --> 21:12.688
TILL WE'RE BETTER?

21:12.689 --> 21:14.790
IT'S ALREADY BEEN
TAKEN CARE OF.

21:14.791 --> 21:17.592
OH, NURSE METALHEAD!

21:17.593 --> 21:19.826
ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE IN BED.

21:19.827 --> 21:21.560
AND I MEAN NOW!

21:21.561 --> 21:23.862
I'VE CREATED
A FRANKENSTEIN.

21:25.030 --> 21:27.564
WHAT IS
TAKING SO LONG?

21:31.267 --> 21:33.835
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

21:33.836 --> 21:35.070
WHAT IS THAT?

21:35.071 --> 21:39.605
WE HAD A LITTLE
ACCIDENT, KRANG.

21:39.606 --> 21:43.541
