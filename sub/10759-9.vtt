WEBVTT

00:08.007 --> 00:09.542
Hey, morning, Fras.

00:10.076 --> 00:10.577
Hi, Roz.

00:11.077 --> 00:13.079
Well... well, is...
is Baby Alice dressed

00:13.079 --> 00:14.547
as a little turkey,

00:14.547 --> 00:16.082
or am I just
very, very hungry?

00:16.082 --> 00:17.584
(both laugh)

00:17.584 --> 00:18.585
We're flying home
for Thanksgiving

00:18.585 --> 00:19.853
right after the show.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.021
I thought
I'd make Alice

00:21.021 --> 00:21.888
look as cute as possible,

00:22.389 --> 00:23.390
so if she cries on the plane,

00:23.390 --> 00:24.891
the other passengers
can't get mad. Ah.

00:24.891 --> 00:26.393
Actually, what I'd like to do

00:26.393 --> 00:28.228
is keep her awake,
so she'll sleep on the plane.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.596
You know, you should just do
what I used to do.

00:29.596 --> 00:31.097
I used to tell the passengers
that if Frederick cried,

00:31.097 --> 00:32.564
I'd buy them all a drink.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.434
And that worked?
Oh, yes.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.336
In fact, one time,
I woke from a short nap,

00:36.336 --> 00:38.772
and the fellow sitting behind us
was flicking the back

00:38.772 --> 00:40.173
of Frederick's
little ear.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.641
Of course, that
was cheating,

00:41.641 --> 00:43.143
and the man did
not get his drink.

00:43.143 --> 00:45.145
So when is Frederick
coming, anyway?

00:45.145 --> 00:47.047
Oh, well, Lilith's dropping
him off around noon,

00:47.047 --> 00:49.816
then she's off to visit
a colleague for Thanksgiving

00:49.816 --> 00:51.251
in Vancouver.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.252
You know, come to think of it,

00:52.252 --> 00:54.254
do they even celebrate
Thanksgiving in Canada?

00:54.254 --> 00:56.756
They will when she leaves.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.596
(doorbell rings)

01:04.596 --> 01:06.099
(footsteps)

01:06.099 --> 01:07.033
Hi, Dad.

01:07.033 --> 01:08.101
Frederick!

01:08.101 --> 01:09.102
(laughing):
Hi.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.103
Hello, Frasier.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.004
Hello. Oh, gosh, you know,

01:11.004 --> 01:12.505
I was starting to get
worried about you.

01:12.505 --> 01:13.506
You're an hour late.

01:13.506 --> 01:15.508
We saw a big accident
on the freeway.

01:15.508 --> 01:16.943
Mom saved this guy's life.

01:16.943 --> 01:18.711
Really? Well, that's
going a bit far.

01:18.711 --> 01:20.180
I simply applied
a tourniquet.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.448
She's a hero.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.616
Yes, that's your mother,
all right, son.

01:23.616 --> 01:25.018
Then the paramedics came

01:25.018 --> 01:27.420
and wanted to give
Mom a transfusion.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.856
Yes, that's your mother,
all right, son.

01:29.856 --> 01:32.325
If you don't mind,
I'd like to use the phone

01:32.325 --> 01:34.260
and call my colleague
and tell him I'll be late.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.662
Yes, of course.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.497
Who is this colleague anyway?

01:37.497 --> 01:39.499
He's the man who supplies
me with lab rats.

01:39.499 --> 01:42.001
It's about time
we got together socially.

01:42.001 --> 01:44.938
I've known him
for over 52 generations.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.373
Ah. Well, if the drumsticks
are about this big,

01:47.373 --> 01:48.808
you'll know why.

01:48.808 --> 01:49.676
Good one, Dad.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.044
Thank you, son.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.612
Hello, Peter,
it's Lilith.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.381
Listen, I'm running about
an hour late, so I...

01:55.381 --> 01:57.550
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry

01:57.550 --> 01:58.885
to hear that.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.854
Well, take care of yourself.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.155
Okay. Good-bye.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.756
What's happened?

02:03.756 --> 02:05.625
Peter's come down
with something.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.961
Thinks he caught it
from the rats.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.162
Oh, now, nobody ever got
anything from a rat

02:09.729 --> 02:10.729
that wasn't resolved
in a day or two.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.065
Off you go.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.400
Hey, Mom,

02:14.400 --> 02:16.402
why don't you spend
Thanksgiving with us?

02:16.402 --> 02:18.371
(laughs) That's a very
good one, Frederick.

02:18.371 --> 02:21.307
Now go kiss your mother
good-bye and unpack, all right?

02:24.777 --> 02:26.279
Would it be that unbearable

02:26.279 --> 02:27.780
for me to be here
for one meal?

02:27.780 --> 02:30.283
As soon as we're done,
I'll go check into a hotel.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.784
I can spend the weekend

02:31.784 --> 02:33.286
working on an article
I've been writing.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.555
Well, you know Niles
is coming this afternoon,

02:35.555 --> 02:37.323
and it'd be very uncomfortable,
I think.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.825
You know, you two
haven't seen each other

02:39.325 --> 02:40.693
since your little tryst.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.462
Oh, please.
Niles and I are adults.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.430
I suppose you're right.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.699
It would mean
a lot to Frederick.

02:46.699 --> 02:47.867
After all,

02:47.867 --> 02:51.104
Thanksgiving
is a time to celebrate family.

02:51.104 --> 02:52.272
(doorknob jiggling)

02:52.272 --> 02:53.139
Come in.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.141
Is the witch
gone yet?

02:59.779 --> 03:01.781
Lilith's still here, Dad.

03:01.781 --> 03:04.050
Oh. In that case,

03:04.050 --> 03:06.219
I'll ask you, too.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.121
Lilith, has my twitch
gone yet?

03:08.621 --> 03:10.123
I had some
very strong coffee

03:10.123 --> 03:11.024
this morning, and...

03:11.024 --> 03:12.992
Skillfully done, Martin.

03:12.992 --> 03:14.727
(footsteps running)

03:14.727 --> 03:15.762
Grandpa!

03:15.762 --> 03:17.497
Oh, Freddy!

03:17.497 --> 03:18.464
How you doing?

03:18.464 --> 03:20.967
So, Dad, is Mom

03:20.967 --> 03:22.268
staying for dinner?

03:22.268 --> 03:23.970
Yes, Frederick, I am.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.306
Isn't that
great, Grandpa?

03:26.306 --> 03:27.307
Great, Freddy.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.309
Real great.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.612
Isn't that great,
Freddy?

03:32.612 --> 03:34.280
Are you okay, Grandpa?

03:34.280 --> 03:36.749
He's worried about his twitch.

03:36.749 --> 03:38.117
(doorbell rings)

03:38.117 --> 03:40.820
(Eddie whimpering)
Come on, Eddie, come on.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.155
What's the matter?

03:42.155 --> 03:43.156
He was perfectly fine

03:43.156 --> 03:44.490
until about
a block from here.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.859
Then he started
whining and trembling.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.497
It's like he senses
an earthquake or a dark force

03:51.497 --> 03:54.500
or-- hello, Lilith--
a vortex of evil.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.803
MARTIN: Here, here,
let me have him.

03:56.803 --> 03:58.338
Come on, I'll take him.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.305
Yeah, it's okay.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.240
Come on, boy.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.574
That's all right.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.475
Don't worry.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.377
Nothing to be scared of.

04:04.377 --> 04:05.878
I'll help with
the groceries.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.380
Hey, Freddy.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.348
Thank you.

04:08.348 --> 04:11.084
Well, I'd better see
how the turkey's coming.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.852
Yes, Daphne's preparing dinner.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.754
Oh, should we tell her
there's an extra person?

04:14.754 --> 04:18.156
(clattering)

04:18.156 --> 04:20.392
No need.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.661
(doorbell rings)

04:24.163 --> 04:25.164
Hello, Frasier.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.165
Niles.

04:26.165 --> 04:27.667
Hello, Lilith.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.935
Hello, Niles.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.702
Lovely to see you again.

04:30.203 --> 04:31.204
Nice to see
you, too.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.206
I trust your flight
was uneventful.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.241
Up, down, bumpy
over the mountains.

04:35.241 --> 04:36.743
Isn't that always the way?

04:36.743 --> 04:39.245
Lilith is joining us
for dinner, Niles.

04:39.245 --> 04:40.513
What a nice surprise.

04:40.513 --> 04:41.681
It certainly
is nice for me.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.049
Well, not as nice
as it is for me.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.518
Oh, stop it, both of you.

04:47.353 --> 04:48.721
I refuse to spend the day

04:48.721 --> 04:50.123
listening
to this stilted chatter.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.557
Well, how would you
have us behave?

04:51.557 --> 04:52.558
Well, why don't you try

04:52.558 --> 04:53.559
going back
to your former relationship.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.061
All we did was
insult each other.

04:55.061 --> 04:56.462
Yes.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.864
You're willing to throw that
away because of one

04:57.864 --> 04:59.198
ill-considered
night of passion?

05:01.034 --> 05:02.035
It happened.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.504
Take from it what you
can learn. Move on.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.473
Well... I learned

05:07.473 --> 05:11.944
if you kiss her too fast,
you get an ice cream headache.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:20.186 --> 05:23.990
You also learned that I have
twice your upper-body strength,

05:23.990 --> 05:25.825
so shut your pie hole.

05:27.026 --> 05:28.961
Was that so hard?

05:31.097 --> 05:32.098
Wait, wait, wait.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.166
What are you doing?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.934
I'm mashing
the potatoes.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.736
By hand? You're supposed
to whip potatoes.

05:37.236 --> 05:39.105
That way, every bite
tastes the same.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.773
Well, isn't that a bit bland?

05:40.773 --> 05:41.574
Hello.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.576
Welcome to potatoes.

05:46.145 --> 05:49.849
Could you just once cook
a traditional Thanksgiving meal?

05:49.849 --> 05:52.218
I mean, look
at this cranberry sauce.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.687
It's supposed to keep
the shape of the can--

05:54.687 --> 05:56.222
quiver a little bit.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.624
What are all these
little chunks in there?

05:58.624 --> 06:00.426
Those are cranberries.

06:00.426 --> 06:01.794
Dad, here you are.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.629
One frozen pumpkin pie
as requested. Ah.

06:03.629 --> 06:04.964
Honestly, wouldn't you rather

06:04.964 --> 06:06.833
I just bake
a pie from scratch?

06:06.833 --> 06:08.234
Is it that
you can't learn

06:08.735 --> 06:11.137
or you won't learn?

06:11.137 --> 06:13.539
I'm done setting the table.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.540
Oh, you set the table.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.542
That's very nice,
very elegant, Frederick.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.444
Oh, yes, Freddy's
been quite the little helper.

06:18.444 --> 06:21.247
Every time I bend over to
check the turkey, there he is.

06:26.185 --> 06:28.020
So, Lilith, tell me about
this article you're writing.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.422
FREDERICK:
It's about me.

06:29.422 --> 06:30.790
Essentially, yes.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.291
I was talking to a friend

06:32.291 --> 06:34.327
who works at the New
York Times Magazine

06:34.327 --> 06:36.329
about raising a
child after divorce.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.331
And she pointed out that,
as a psychiatrist,

06:38.331 --> 06:40.133
I might have a
unique perspective.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.369
You know,
since it's about me,

06:43.369 --> 06:45.171
shouldn't I get
something for it?

06:45.171 --> 06:47.273
You're not getting a minibike.

06:47.273 --> 06:48.040
But, Mom...

06:48.040 --> 06:49.542
We have talked about this.

06:49.542 --> 06:50.943
You can get one
when you're 15.

06:50.943 --> 06:52.712
But all my friends
have minibikes.

06:52.712 --> 06:55.081
Yes, and if all of your friends
decided to enter

06:55.081 --> 06:56.582
a level-four biohazard area

06:56.582 --> 06:59.085
without their
environmental containment suits,

06:59.085 --> 07:00.386
would you do that, too?

07:00.386 --> 07:01.921
This is different.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.189
No, it's not.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.457
Dad?

07:04.457 --> 07:05.191
Sorry, Frederick.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.026
I'm with your mother
on this one.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.127
Dinner's almost ready.

07:08.127 --> 07:08.995
Excuse me.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.900
You know what
I think, Dad?

07:13.900 --> 07:16.736
You and Mom should write
this article together.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.539
Well, I'm sure your mother
can write it without my help.

07:19.539 --> 07:20.973
But it was her idea.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.642
Hmm? She told me
on the plane

07:22.642 --> 07:24.444
how much easier
it would be.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.746
I just don't think she
knows how to ask you.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.080
It is an intriguing idea.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.550
MARTIN: Frasier, I could use
some help out here.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.853
He's picking the raisins
out of the stuffing.

07:33.853 --> 07:34.687
Oh, Lord.

07:34.687 --> 07:37.190
All right,
coming, Dad.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.028
You know, I think
you and Dad

07:42.028 --> 07:43.529
should write this
article together.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.064
Together?

07:45.064 --> 07:47.533
Well, I think the last thing
your father wants

07:47.533 --> 07:49.068
is to collaborate
with me.

07:49.068 --> 07:51.037
It was his idea.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.539
He just told me how
much fun it would be.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.575
Well, it's
an interesting notion.

07:55.575 --> 07:56.876
Beautiful job

07:56.876 --> 07:58.744
carving that turkey,
Dr. Crane.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.646
Well, I picked up a thing
or two in medical school.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.516
In case you're wondering,
this bird appears

08:03.516 --> 08:06.018
to have died
of a massive head trauma.

08:08.287 --> 08:09.655
Did you wash
your hands, Frederick?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.657
Yeah. Uncle Niles
even showed me how

08:11.657 --> 08:12.658
to open the door
with my elbow

08:12.658 --> 08:15.528
so I don't need to
touch the handle.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.897
What are uncles for?

08:17.897 --> 08:19.765
Daphne, is your
fiancé joining us?

08:19.765 --> 08:21.267
No. I'll be seeing him later.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.636
Donny has his own
Thanksgiving tradition.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.471
He has a dinner for
all the divorced men

08:25.471 --> 08:26.973
he's represented
during the year.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.808
He's hosting 25 today.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.577
Wow. 25 lonely, bitter men.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.479
It's been a good year.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.250
Uncle Niles,
Mom's writing

08:37.250 --> 08:38.650
an article about me.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.219
Really?

08:40.219 --> 08:42.221
It's about raising
a child after divorce.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.590
Yes, it sounds fascinating,
doesn't it?

08:44.590 --> 08:47.260
It's a subject that's very
near and dear to my own heart.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.195
Are you suggesting
we collaborate?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.631
Well, if you think
I might be helpful.

08:51.631 --> 08:52.532
What a great idea.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.000
You can write it together.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.967
I'd be willing.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.469
Well, we
certainly did well

08:56.469 --> 08:58.304
on our first
collaboration.

08:58.304 --> 08:59.505
You know, Lilith,
we could probably get most

08:59.505 --> 09:00.439
of it done
in the time

09:00.439 --> 09:01.807
you're still
here in town.

09:01.807 --> 09:02.675
And if she stayed here,

09:03.142 --> 09:04.510
you can finish
the whole thing.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.812
Well, guess it'll be
all right by me.

09:06.812 --> 09:08.314
Daphne, would that

09:08.314 --> 09:09.782
be too much of
an imposition?

09:09.782 --> 09:10.783
Not at all.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.785
I'll be spending the
weekend with Donny.

09:12.785 --> 09:14.754
Now, where is your father
with that gravy?

09:14.754 --> 09:16.255
Well, then
I'll stay here.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.256
Although, maybe we

09:17.757 --> 09:19.258
should run this
by your father.

09:19.258 --> 09:20.192
Hmm.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.594
(crashing)

09:24.063 --> 09:25.464
No need.

09:32.838 --> 09:34.840
(paper tearing)

09:35.775 --> 09:38.344
Yes. I think we should
have something

09:38.344 --> 09:41.180
about noncustodial
parents and discipline.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.548
Exactly.

09:42.548 --> 09:43.549
The weekend father

09:43.549 --> 09:46.052
need not be
a weakened father.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.553
(chuckles)

09:47.553 --> 09:49.555
Frasier, you still
have a direct line

09:49.555 --> 09:51.057
to my funny bone.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.058
(laughs)

09:52.058 --> 09:54.560
Thank goodness,
the line wasn't busy.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.562
Now, stop. If we
laugh all night,

09:56.562 --> 09:58.898
we'll never get
any work done.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.232
(video game playing)

10:00.232 --> 10:01.767
(knock at door)

10:01.767 --> 10:04.270
Hey, Frederick,
I'm leaving.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.271
I just...

10:05.271 --> 10:06.272
What you doing?

10:06.272 --> 10:07.773
I'm saving the universe.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.241
You want to help?

10:09.241 --> 10:11.277
I wouldn't know
where to begin.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.745
It's easy.
I'll show you.

10:12.745 --> 10:15.047
Oh, all right.
What do I do?

10:15.047 --> 10:15.848
That's your guy.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.350
You've just escaped

10:17.350 --> 10:20.152
from an intergalactic
maximum security prison pod.

10:20.152 --> 10:21.921
Like they could hold me.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.923
Now, once you leave
this chamber,

10:23.923 --> 10:24.924
you can go left or right,

10:24.924 --> 10:27.426
and different things
will happen to you.

10:27.426 --> 10:28.427
Okay.

10:28.427 --> 10:29.929
(character screams)

10:29.929 --> 10:32.431
What happened?

10:32.431 --> 10:38.237
Wow. I never saw the guy
trip and fall before.

10:38.237 --> 10:39.038
Try it again.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.873
You have two lives left.
Oh.

10:40.873 --> 10:42.675
(character screams)

10:42.675 --> 10:45.144
I... can't seem to
get out of this room.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.179
Is this some sort
of advanced level?

10:47.179 --> 10:48.481
No.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.616
This is, like,
the training area.

10:50.616 --> 10:53.986
I didn't even know
you could die here.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.224
(character screams)

10:58.224 --> 11:00.726
I have to get out
of this room.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.728
The reset button
is on the right.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.230
You want
something to drink?

11:04.230 --> 11:05.631
Quiet.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.533
Hi, Dad.

11:07.533 --> 11:08.501
Oh. Hi, son.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.935
How's the writing?

11:09.935 --> 11:12.171
Well, it's coming
along nicely, thanks.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.506
Oh. Mom wants to know

11:13.506 --> 11:15.474
if you'd bring out
a little wine.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.009
Oh, all right.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.513
You know, it's great to see
you and Mom working together.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.515
I think she
kind of misses you.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.516
Really?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.017
Yeah. She talks about you

11:25.017 --> 11:26.519
all the time, you know--

11:26.519 --> 11:27.820
how wonderful you are,

11:27.820 --> 11:30.489
and how she's never met
another man like you.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.792
You go take that out to her.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.293
I'll finish up in here.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.295
Thank you, son.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.333
There you are.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.835
Oh. Oh, thank you.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.336
Mm-hmm.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.338
Um, I've been rearranging
this outline.

11:46.338 --> 11:48.340
Why don't you
take a look?

11:48.340 --> 11:49.775
Uh, looks fine.

11:49.775 --> 11:52.978
Frasier, you can't see it
from there. Sit down.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.384
You know, I'm really
enjoying this collaboration.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.885
Me, too.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.388
Is it me, or is it
getting warm?

12:02.388 --> 12:05.191
It is a little warm.

12:05.191 --> 12:08.294
All right, boy,
I'm coming.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.128
I'm coming.

12:09.628 --> 12:10.496
FRASIER:
You know, Dad,

12:10.496 --> 12:12.031
let me walk you out.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.032
Okay.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.834
Something I want
to discuss with you.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.368
(growls)
You know,

12:16.368 --> 12:18.070
I've never seen him
so eager to take a walk.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.939
I wonder what...

12:19.939 --> 12:21.340
Oh, right.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.846
Hey, Mom, how's
the article going?

12:26.846 --> 12:28.748
Very well, thank you.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.150
You know, I've never
seen Dad this happy.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.619
Oh? What do you mean?

12:33.619 --> 12:36.021
Well, all he does
is talk about you--

12:36.522 --> 12:37.523
how pretty you look,

12:37.523 --> 12:39.892
and how smart
you are...

12:39.892 --> 12:43.129
and how much he misses you.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.133
What makes you think
she's coming on to you?

12:47.133 --> 12:49.935
Well, actually,
Frederick told me.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.237
But, you know,
it actually makes sense.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.739
I mean, this colleague of hers
gets mysteriously ill;

12:53.739 --> 12:55.741
she lassos me into writing
this article with her,

12:55.741 --> 12:57.209
then all of a sudden,
before I know it,

12:57.209 --> 12:59.578
the bun is off, she's waggling
a bare shoulder at me.

12:59.578 --> 13:02.448
Oh, please. Some of us
just had a big meal.

13:03.849 --> 13:04.750
(knock at door)

13:04.750 --> 13:06.252
It's not your turn yet.

13:06.252 --> 13:07.753
I still have two more lives.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.221
It's Lilith.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.756
(character screams)

13:13.259 --> 13:15.060
I need to talk to you.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.729
Does the door have to be closed?

13:16.729 --> 13:18.097
I think it's best.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.598
It's of a personal nature.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.100
What's this about?

13:21.100 --> 13:23.102
Well, it's about
an attraction

13:23.102 --> 13:25.137
that I thought was over,

13:25.137 --> 13:28.073
and now I'm beginning
to think maybe it's not.

13:28.073 --> 13:29.475
Usually, in my dreams

13:29.942 --> 13:33.312
this is where
I try to run and can't.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.148
This isn't about you,
you egomaniac.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.650
This is about Frasier.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.452
I think he wants
us together again.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.288
He knows how I feel
about you.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.289
Not us!

13:43.289 --> 13:44.790
Me and Frasier!

13:44.790 --> 13:47.793
Is there a chair here
I could talk to?

13:47.793 --> 13:49.795
(character screams)

13:50.663 --> 13:52.531
Well, what makes you think

13:52.531 --> 13:54.934
he wants you
to get back together?

13:54.934 --> 13:56.335
Well, first, he offers

13:56.335 --> 13:58.337
to collaborate
on this article.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.839
Now he's plying
me with wine.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.340
At this very moment,

14:01.340 --> 14:02.842
I suspect he's
asking your father

14:02.842 --> 14:04.243
to clear out
for the night.

14:04.243 --> 14:07.179
Well, so he took a professional
interest in your article,

14:07.179 --> 14:09.682
and he offered you some wine
on Thanksgiving.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.983
Now who's the egomaniac?

14:11.784 --> 14:14.787
Perhaps I am
overreacting.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.289
I'll just have to
keep my eyes peeled

14:17.289 --> 14:19.291
for more
conclusive evidence.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.728
I didn't know
there was a door there.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.196
Then again,
maybe I've just made

14:24.196 --> 14:25.698
this whole thing up
in my head.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.032
Tell you what, Dad.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.401
Take a minute,
and then come back in.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.370
See what you think
is going on in there,

14:31.370 --> 14:34.206
and then find some subtle way
to tell me what you think.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.541
All right, okay, uh,

14:35.541 --> 14:36.442
just give me a minute.

14:39.144 --> 14:43.482
(Ravel's "Bolero" playing)

15:03.235 --> 15:05.704
Frasier.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.539
Lilith.

15:07.539 --> 15:10.309
Well, isn't this... nice?

15:10.309 --> 15:13.412
Yes. Very nice.

15:14.179 --> 15:15.681
Oh, uh, excuse me again.

15:15.681 --> 15:18.517
I just came back to get
an umbrella in case it rains.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.886
But I hope it doesn't,
'cause Eddie's just dying

15:20.886 --> 15:22.388
to play this new game
I taught him.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.890
I take off his leash,
and I say, "Run for your life!"

15:24.890 --> 15:26.392
(laughs)

15:26.392 --> 15:29.795
That's exactly what I say:
"Run for your life!"

15:29.795 --> 15:31.563
Thank you, Dad.

15:31.563 --> 15:32.865
Okay.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.300
Run for your life!

15:34.300 --> 15:37.169
Frasier, we have to talk.

15:37.169 --> 15:38.637
Yes, Lilith, we do.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.539
I mean, I can't just
sit here all night,

15:40.539 --> 15:43.008
waiting for you
to make your move.

15:43.008 --> 15:46.345
Well, you've just got this
all worked out, haven't you?

15:46.345 --> 15:47.680
Well, let's see.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.181
Candlelight, wine,
soft music--

15:49.181 --> 15:50.683
What else do I need?

15:50.683 --> 15:51.684
I don't know
what's worse--

15:52.184 --> 15:54.186
that you want me back,
or that you think

15:54.186 --> 15:55.454
I could be
won so easily.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.823
Wait. You think
I'm responsible for this?

15:57.823 --> 15:59.291
You assume you can
just snap your fingers,

15:59.291 --> 16:00.793
and old Frasier
will come a-running?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.795
Well, I'm sorry. It doesn't
work that way, sister.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.698
First of all,
I have to be finessed!

16:07.099 --> 16:09.101
I didn't do any of this.

16:09.101 --> 16:13.405
And if you didn't either,
then someone is setting us up.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.708
But who...

16:15.708 --> 16:17.643
Frederick.

16:17.643 --> 16:21.914
He told me that you've
been pining for me.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.583
He just told me
the same about you.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.452
Good Lord.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.454
Here we are
writing an article

16:28.454 --> 16:30.856
on taking your child
through a divorce, and...

16:30.856 --> 16:33.225
our own son is nursing
a hopeless fantasy

16:33.225 --> 16:35.127
that we'll get back together.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.895
We've got to go
talk with him.

16:36.895 --> 16:37.730
Now, wait a minute.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.231
Something is not right here.

16:39.231 --> 16:41.233
When has Frederick
ever expressed

16:41.233 --> 16:43.736
the slightest desire
to see us together?

16:43.736 --> 16:46.238
He could have been
sublimating it for years.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.240
Yeah, even so,
he lied to both of us.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.743
He had to have known
that we'd compare notes.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.045
All right, so his plan
was a little artless.

16:53.045 --> 16:56.248
Unless that's exactly
what he wanted.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.050
What do you mean?
Think about it.

16:58.050 --> 17:00.386
He makes us believe
that he wants us together.

17:00.386 --> 17:01.887
Of course,
we have to tell him

17:01.887 --> 17:03.255
that's not
going to happen.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.691
His hopes are dashed,
and we feel so guilty

17:05.691 --> 17:09.595
that we compensate by getting
him something he wants.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.396
A minibike?

17:11.396 --> 17:14.532
That's a very clever
little boy we have.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.736
God, could he actually
be so devious?

17:17.736 --> 17:19.104
Oh, well, if he wants
something badly enough,

17:19.637 --> 17:20.638
he will figure out a way
to get it.

17:20.638 --> 17:21.640
Remember when he was a baby--

17:21.640 --> 17:26.045
the bottle
at the end of the maze?

17:29.915 --> 17:33.285
You know, I kind of
regret doing that.

17:33.285 --> 17:34.119
Frederick!

17:34.620 --> 17:35.621
What are you
going to do,

17:35.621 --> 17:36.622
just come out
and ask him?

17:36.622 --> 17:39.124
No, of course not.
He'll only deny it.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.125
What, then?
(door opens)

17:40.125 --> 17:41.627
Just go with me on this.
All right.

17:41.627 --> 17:42.628
Frederick, have a seat.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.129
We need to talk to you.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.030
What about?

17:45.030 --> 17:47.032
We know that
you've been trying

17:47.032 --> 17:50.436
to maneuver us together,
and it's only natural

17:50.436 --> 17:52.704
for a child of divorce
to want that.

17:52.704 --> 17:55.107
Generally speaking,
your plan would be fruitless,

17:55.641 --> 17:57.643
but when your father and I
let down our guard

17:57.643 --> 17:59.645
and looked at each other
in the candlelight,

18:00.112 --> 18:03.148
we realized that
we belong together.

18:03.148 --> 18:07.152
In other words...
we're getting remarried.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.156
Do you really mean it?

18:14.326 --> 18:16.495
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.764
I'm going to go tell
Uncle Niles.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.267
Have you lost
your mind?!

18:22.267 --> 18:23.769
He's cooler
than I thought.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.137
Cooler?

18:25.137 --> 18:26.672
This isn't a game of poker.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.609
This is our son being
lied to by his parents.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.544
We've got to go in there,
tell him the truth,

18:32.544 --> 18:33.579
and make it up to him

18:33.579 --> 18:35.080
even if it takes a fleet
of minibikes.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.014
No, no, no,
Frasier.

18:36.014 --> 18:37.916
No, see, we called his bluff.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.451
Now he's calling ours.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.287
The question is,
what's our next move?

18:42.287 --> 18:44.156
Oh, I know. Why don't we
just consult this handy

18:44.156 --> 18:46.658
little guide for
divorced parents?

18:48.460 --> 18:49.795
We can't blink first.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.263
We've got to up the ante.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.731
Good idea, Lilith.
You know what?

18:52.731 --> 18:53.732
Let's go in there
and promise him

18:53.732 --> 18:55.534
the baby brother
he'll never have!

19:02.474 --> 19:05.377
What's this joyous news I hear?

19:06.812 --> 19:07.746
You know, Frederick,

19:07.746 --> 19:10.716
you're going to have
to give up all of your friends

19:10.716 --> 19:13.085
because we're going
to live here in Seattle.

19:13.085 --> 19:16.321
I'd live anywhere
to be a family again.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.457
So, it is true.

19:18.457 --> 19:19.758
Congratulations
to you both.

19:19.758 --> 19:21.260
Good night.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.229
Don't you want your coat,
Uncle Niles?

19:24.229 --> 19:26.365
No, thank you.

19:26.365 --> 19:30.202
I'm going to go call
my friends.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.670
I love you.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.173
I don't understand.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.674
I was so sure.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.210
Oh, gee, don't be so
tough on yourself, Lilith.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.213
After all, what parent doesn't,
at one time or another,

19:41.213 --> 19:43.715
completely obliterate
their child's chances

19:43.715 --> 19:46.618
of ever trusting
another human being?

19:49.321 --> 19:53.125
Ah, well, there he is,
telling his friends

19:53.125 --> 19:55.060
that all his dreams
have come true.

19:55.060 --> 19:59.398
Unless that's what
he wants us to think.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.400
When will you stop?

20:01.400 --> 20:02.935
FREDERICK:
It worked.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.303
All I did was tap into

20:04.303 --> 20:06.004
my parents'
feelings of inadequacy,

20:06.004 --> 20:06.838
and they crumbled.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.340
BOY:
What does that mean?

20:08.340 --> 20:10.042
FREDERICK:
I'm getting a minibike.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.512
Frederick.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.913
Uh-oh.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.815
(phone disconnects)

20:16.815 --> 20:21.253
Do I know my son,
or do I know my son?

20:21.253 --> 20:24.223
He was willing to put us
through absolute hell

20:24.223 --> 20:25.490
just for a minibike?

20:25.490 --> 20:27.259
You know what
this means, don't you?

20:27.259 --> 20:28.994
Yes, he's normal;
we're not bad parents.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.829
Well done,
Dr. Sternin.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.331
Well done, Dr. Crane.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.733
(laughs)

20:36.868 --> 20:39.204
Well, we really
should get in there.

20:39.204 --> 20:40.606
Yes, I suppose
we should.

20:40.606 --> 20:42.407
Must be sheer torment for him

20:42.407 --> 20:43.709
waiting for
the ax to fall.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.244
Absolute hell.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.512
Absolute nightmare.

20:47.512 --> 20:49.114
Wine?

20:49.114 --> 20:50.215
Love some.
