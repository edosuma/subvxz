01:28.546 --> 01:30.215
The Lions
are locked in the hangar

01:30.298 --> 01:32.342
and the Paladins have been
taken to the brig.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.935
Hmm? Hmm.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.271
Mm-hmm.

01:45.355 --> 01:48.983
-What are you doing?
-I'm feeling for a secret passage.

01:49.067 --> 01:52.320
You've watched too many movies, Lance.
There's no secret passage.

01:52.403 --> 01:55.115
Oh, really?
Then how do you explain this?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.538
I meant, uh, this!

02:02.080 --> 02:03.665
D'ooh, ow, ow, ow!

02:03.957 --> 02:06.334
Will someone shut him up?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.836
There's only one guard
patrolling out there.

02:09.169 --> 02:11.881
If we can get this door open,
we can overpower him.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.426
What happened to Coran?

02:16.177 --> 02:18.596
He must have managed to hide
when we were captured.

02:18.847 --> 02:22.350
At least we have one ally out there
still able to fight for us.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.936
Are you saying our fate
rests in Coran's hands?

02:28.648 --> 02:30.859
I will help you look for that passage.

02:46.124 --> 02:49.419
Uh-huh.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.551
Quite the sticky wicket
I find myself in, hmm?

02:56.634 --> 03:00.179
Absolutely True Tales
of an Incredibly Humble Hero.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.141
A Hero's Escape.

03:03.224 --> 03:06.144
I find myself in the cargo hold
of the Black Lion,

03:06.227 --> 03:09.772
a strategic and very conscious choice
on my part.

03:11.107 --> 03:14.402
It's on me to free my compatriots
and save the day.

03:14.485 --> 03:15.695
Luckily, I'm up to the task.

03:16.112 --> 03:19.115
Some men shrink in the face of danger,
while others stand up and say...

03:19.198 --> 03:20.909
Ah!

03:27.248 --> 03:28.124
Oh!

03:28.958 --> 03:31.044
Hello, little friends.
I didn't see you there.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.757
Oh, uh, just so you know,
I didn't scream because I was scared.

03:35.840 --> 03:39.886
That was a shriek of intimidation,
by which I mean it would intimidate you.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.054
Uh...

03:41.429 --> 03:44.474
Well, anyway, I'll get us out. Hmm.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.268
And then the world will read
about us in my memoirs...

03:47.352 --> 03:49.437
Absolutely True Tales of...

03:49.896 --> 03:51.689
Hey, where are you going?

04:02.158 --> 04:03.159
Huh?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.787
Hmm? Huh?

04:05.954 --> 04:06.788
Ah!

04:09.749 --> 04:13.378
Well, I was gonna try that next.
You just beat me to it.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.004
Good job, guys.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.714
And where were you this whole time?

04:17.798 --> 04:19.841
I could've really used
some help in there.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.392
Oh, you're hurt.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.812
Well, you just sit tight.
Old Coran is on the case.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.322
Now you stay here.
I'll take care of the enemy combatant.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.366
Huh?

04:49.580 --> 04:51.332
D'ah!

04:54.544 --> 04:55.712
Whoa!

05:19.319 --> 05:22.322
We've got all the Lions
and their Paladins locked down.

05:22.780 --> 05:27.327
If Voltron survived, do you think
that means Lotor is still alive?

05:28.119 --> 05:30.121
That's what we're going to find out.

05:30.496 --> 05:34.000
What if he finds us?
What do you think he'll do to us?

05:34.375 --> 05:36.627
I will always take care of you, Ezor.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.963
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

05:39.297 --> 05:42.884
-Do you really believe that?
-Just look at what we've done already.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.386
We just took down a Galra cruiser.

05:45.470 --> 05:49.474
And we have the mighty Paladins of Voltron
locked in our brig.

05:49.766 --> 05:53.394
We are destined for greatness, Ezor.
Trust me.

05:55.855 --> 05:56.981
I do.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.817
Now let's go torture some prisoners.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.986
That's my girl.

06:02.653 --> 06:06.949
And then, I heard they was giving away
free Kalteneckers with every purchase.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.285
Wait, did you say "free"?

06:09.702 --> 06:12.288
Greetings, fellow scallywags.
How's the booty?

06:14.123 --> 06:15.208
"Booty"?

06:16.292 --> 06:19.629
Anyhow, how's--
how about capturing those Paladins, eh?

06:19.712 --> 06:20.630
Ha ha.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.509
Remind me where you're--
I mean, uh, we're keeping them.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.385
Wait a second.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.055
That's Blofar's scarf!

06:29.305 --> 06:33.226
He stole it from that Valdostian
before we flushed him into space.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.895
That's right,
and I won it from Blofar

06:35.978 --> 06:38.147
in a game of Gorblonthian Checkers.

06:38.439 --> 06:41.359
But Blofar hates
Gorblonthian Checkers.

06:41.442 --> 06:46.155
Yes, that's right, which is why
we used the Melmakian Rule set.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.867
Did you say "the Melmakian Rule set"?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.953
Did I?

06:52.036 --> 06:55.081
-What-- what I meant to say was...
-Who are you?

06:55.373 --> 06:56.707
Huh?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.128
Huh?

07:05.299 --> 07:09.178
Wait, aren't you one of Lotor's generals?

07:09.637 --> 07:10.763
Acxa.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.583
Look who's here. It's Voltron.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.794
We're going to have a little talk.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.924
Hey, you're the guys
that Lotor shot into space.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.968
And the ones that were trying to kill us.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.388
Yeah, sure,
but we're all friends now, right?

07:52.847 --> 07:55.308
I, for one, am glad you survived.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.810
I'm glad you survived, too.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.229
It's no fun torturing a dead person.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.900
Oh. So maybe not?

08:04.609 --> 08:07.862
Where have you been all this time?
And what happened to Lotor?

08:07.945 --> 08:09.572
What are you talking about?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.241
We're talking
about your little disappearing act.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.786
Answer the question!
How did you survive that explosion?

08:16.078 --> 08:17.955
Don't you know? You were there.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.708
I think there's a little confusion
about how the...

08:20.791 --> 08:24.212
"we ask questions, you give us answers"
scenario works.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.881
Enough of your games.
Where is Lotor?

08:27.340 --> 08:30.051
Lotor's dead.
We left him in the Quintessence Field.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.721
Yeah, that doesn't really add up.
Why aren't you dead?

08:33.971 --> 08:37.225
Because of the power of teamwork?

08:38.017 --> 08:40.269
I'm going to ask you one more time,

08:40.352 --> 08:43.688
and then we're going to have to take
a more extreme approach.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.899
The fun part.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.778
What happened to Lotor
and where have you been all this time?

09:02.208 --> 09:03.709
What are you doing here?

09:06.671 --> 09:09.298
I picked up the signal you were sending
to your home planet.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.468
I assume that's how Ezor and Zethrid
were able to intercept you.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.972
-But why are you helping us?
-We don't have time for that now.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.684
Your friends are being held in
a detention cell several floors below us.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.395
We have to find a way to free them,
get to your Lions,

09:22.478 --> 09:24.188
and most likely blast our way out.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.481
Well, that'll be a challenge.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.235
The Lions are nearly too weak to fly.
They'd be little help in a fight.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.405
So if the entire pirate fleet
comes after us?

09:32.488 --> 09:35.616
We'd be right back here
or shot into space.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.870
We're gonna need a distraction,
not to mention an escape route.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.834
Oh, there's an ion cannon in hangar one,
right next to the Lions.

09:44.917 --> 09:45.960
That should work.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.296
In the event of a hull breach,
these cruisers are designed

09:48.379 --> 09:51.507
to seal off the other hangars
in order to maintain the ship's integrity.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.760
We can use the ion cannon
to blast a hole in the hangar door.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.554
The other doors will seal.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.390
So the pirates would only have
escape pods to chase after us

09:59.473 --> 10:01.183
until they override the system.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.187
You free your friends
and find your helmets and weapons.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.816
Once I blow open the hangar, you and your
Lions will be sucked into space.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.485
Right.
We'll be ready to go in five doboshes.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.826
If you insist on maintaining
this charade of ignorance,

10:18.909 --> 10:21.621
you leave us no choice
but to apply pressure.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.956
Finally. Who's our first victim?

10:28.085 --> 10:28.919
You.

10:29.545 --> 10:33.883
I'd bet half my fleet this group of heroes
has a soft spot for the small one.

10:35.509 --> 10:36.552
Don't you touch her!

10:41.807 --> 10:45.728
Your defiance is adorable
and so very misguided.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.229
Leave us alone.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.025
Pidge!

10:51.108 --> 10:52.276
Let her go!

11:24.600 --> 11:27.061
We've got an intruder in hangar one.
Send backup!

11:52.086 --> 11:54.171
Where did I put that helmet?

11:55.881 --> 11:58.926
Huh, just gonna have to do this
the old fashioned way.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.158
Ah, hello, there.
It looks like your shift is up.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.701
I'm here to replace you.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.661
My shift just started.

12:27.746 --> 12:32.126
Who are you?
Hey, is that Blofar's scarf?

12:32.918 --> 12:34.295
Fine.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.047
I challenge you
to a battle of fisticuffs!

12:44.555 --> 12:47.516
Easy there, big fella.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.936
Simmer down now.
It's just a little scheduling conflict.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.728
Answers!

13:33.270 --> 13:35.064
We told you, he's--

13:35.147 --> 13:36.941
Hull breach in hangar one.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.151
Lockdown sequence initiated.

13:51.121 --> 13:51.956
This is it.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.459
The next time that door opens,
overwhelm the guard.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.051
Huh?

14:09.598 --> 14:13.018
Hello, little friends.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.478
What?

14:14.562 --> 14:16.397
-Where?
-Where? What are they saying?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.524
Coran's trying to rescue us.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.317
And he's got help.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.111
Acxa.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.279
What?

14:39.336 --> 14:40.921
Joke's on you!

14:41.422 --> 14:43.340
I've got you right where I want you.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.568
See? You got lucky.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.821
Coran, where's Acxa?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.824
I don't know. Where am I?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.492
Are you okay?

15:11.869 --> 15:15.956
Never better. Now let's get
our "belmards" and "hayards."

15:16.040 --> 15:17.958
Don't worry. We got you.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.461
Oh, thank you, Princess Allura.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.823
Acxa, what are you doing here?

15:49.907 --> 15:52.618
I should've known you'd show up
once we got the Paladins.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.537
She's always been sweet
on that one with the flippity hair.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.583
Yah!

16:19.520 --> 16:20.729
Hey, how do I look?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.606
Mm, kinda dumb.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.984
Do you think there's a switch
on here or something?

16:25.442 --> 16:28.904
I cannot wait until that thing
turns on and cuts your head off.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.239
Our bayards.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.826
They have weapons and we don't.
Any suggestions?

16:33.909 --> 16:36.745
Unhand those bayards, you scallywags!

16:37.413 --> 16:38.706
Huh?

16:39.707 --> 16:42.334
So much for the element of surprise.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.769
Lance, lead the way.
Keep the team together.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.022
Wait, where are you going?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.525
Acxa saved our skin.
I'm not gonna leave her behind.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.694
I'll meet up with you guys soon.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.577
Let's get to the Lions.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.619
Oh, look, Acxa,
it's your favorite Paladin.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.205
So do you guys actually know each other?

18:01.288 --> 18:04.583
Yeah, don't you remember
how she never wanted to kill him?

18:04.792 --> 18:07.211
I guess it is true love.

18:07.544 --> 18:09.588
Can't we just fight?

18:15.302 --> 18:16.470
Huh?

18:28.899 --> 18:31.151
Huh? Ha ha!

18:34.738 --> 18:36.907
Hmm, must not have wanted any more.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.617
Huh? Huh?

19:12.276 --> 19:15.320
-Is that what I think it is?
-Synthian nitrate.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.827
Guys! Zero in on my location
and fire on the ship.

19:21.910 --> 19:22.744
Are you sure?

19:22.953 --> 19:24.329
Just do it!

20:11.210 --> 20:14.796
I just looked at the Lions
and they're in worse shape than ever.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.800
We should give them some time to recharge
before we head back on our way.

20:20.385 --> 20:24.181
Wow, a lot of things have really changed
over the past few weeks.

20:24.264 --> 20:27.142
"Weeks"?
What are you talking about?

20:27.351 --> 20:31.230
The last time we saw you.
You were fighting us alongside Lotor.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.691
That was three deca-phoebs ago.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.778
No one has seen you
since your fight with Lotor.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.447
-That's impossible.
-It's true.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.700
After Lotor jettisoned us,

20:43.784 --> 20:46.328
we managed to make it to cover
on a meteoroid.

20:46.411 --> 20:50.207
There we saw both Voltron
and Lotor disappear.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.628
Eventually Voltron re-emerged... alone.

20:55.087 --> 20:59.174
But then there was an explosion,
and after that... nothing.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.844
That was three deca-phoebs ago.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.013
Whoa.

21:05.889 --> 21:09.351
So, as far as everyone else
in the universe is concerned,

21:09.434 --> 21:12.229
Voltron has been gone
for three deca-phoebs?

21:15.649 --> 21:19.027
That explains the discrepancies
in the star charts in our Lions.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.613
I thought they were off
because of our inter-dimensional jumping,

21:21.697 --> 21:23.156
which I guess they were, in a way.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.243
Because when you think about it, that must
have been the cause of the time slippage

21:26.326 --> 21:29.454
between our experience
and that of the rest of the universe.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.959
So how did you end up here,
helping us?

21:35.210 --> 21:39.172
Zethrid, Ezor, and I were marooned
on the meteoroid for days.

21:39.256 --> 21:43.343
Finally, a Galra ship came to investigate
Lotor's last known whereabouts.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.636
We took it over.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.808
With Lotor gone, it was clear that there
was a power vacuum in the Galra Empire.

21:49.891 --> 21:53.562
Zethrid and Ezor wanted to exploit that
for their own gain...

21:54.479 --> 21:57.107
but I knew I had to find my own path.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.900
And it led me to you.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.696
Thank you... for saving us.

22:05.449 --> 22:09.411
I hope that this makes up, in some way,
for the wrong I've done.

22:09.995 --> 22:13.290
I realize now that Lotor
wasn't the man I thought he was.

22:13.373 --> 22:17.544
He preached unity,
but in the end, he sought only power.

22:18.045 --> 22:22.466
I understand how you feel.
I fell for Lotor's lies as well.

22:22.924 --> 22:26.762
I'll do everything I can out here
to help the Voltron Coalition.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.558
Wow, so everyone that was helping us
thinks we're dead.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.476
Wait.

22:32.851 --> 22:36.396
I haven't been able to get ahold
of my dad on Earth or Matt and the Rebels.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.565
What's happened to them
in the last three years?

22:38.940 --> 22:42.402
And if Ezor and Zethrid
became warlords in that time...

22:42.694 --> 22:44.696
what else has changed?

22:45.305 --> 22:51.404
