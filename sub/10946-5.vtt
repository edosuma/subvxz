WEBVTT

00:00.310 --> 00:02.839
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:04.401 --> 00:06.650
Well, at least we saved one of them.

00:09.804 --> 00:12.708
Hey! Where do you get off
telling her that you love her!

00:12.742 --> 00:14.877
Of course I love her.
All you do is hold her back.

00:17.302 --> 00:18.781
I think we need a break.

00:18.815 --> 00:22.234
No, Ty, I mean... I love you so much!

01:11.327 --> 01:12.869
Hey, Caleb.

01:12.889 --> 01:14.134
Yeah, I'm here... why?

01:14.168 --> 01:15.536
Well, I didn't wanna just barge in,

01:15.570 --> 01:17.571
in case you weren't alone.

01:17.606 --> 01:19.572
Why wouldn't I be?

01:19.607 --> 01:22.575
It's just as easy to make
up as it is to break up.

01:22.610 --> 01:25.278
It's not a break up, okay?

01:25.312 --> 01:29.015
It's a break. We're... taking a break.

01:29.050 --> 01:30.450
Well, whatever you choose to call it,

01:30.484 --> 01:32.285
I respect your decision.

01:32.319 --> 01:34.921
Just, uh, here to check up on ya.

01:34.956 --> 01:36.889
See how other things are going.

01:36.923 --> 01:38.324
Well, I appreciate it,

01:38.359 --> 01:39.992
but I actually have to get going because...

01:40.026 --> 01:41.827
I'm gonna be late for work.

01:41.862 --> 01:43.863
Well, it's good you got so much work.

01:43.897 --> 01:47.133
It helps keep your mind off the decision.

01:48.348 --> 01:49.941
It's all good, Caleb.

01:49.961 --> 01:52.938
Stay, finish your coffee.

01:54.542 --> 01:57.376
- Ty!
- Hey! What're you doing here?

01:57.410 --> 01:59.879
Well, I was on a trail ride
and I thought I'd stop by.

01:59.913 --> 02:02.481
Bad timing. I'm just on my way to
the reserve for an early shift.

02:02.515 --> 02:04.917
Oh, I can't stop thinking
about that poor momma wolf.

02:04.951 --> 02:06.585
I mean, how's the baby doing?

02:06.619 --> 02:09.020
Not good. He needs a lot of care.

02:09.054 --> 02:12.023
Well, maybe I could come with
you and help out sometime.

02:12.057 --> 02:15.436
Yeah, sure. Not today, but another time.

02:15.456 --> 02:16.995
Ty...

02:17.029 --> 02:21.459
I mean... even though you and Amy are...

02:23.181 --> 02:24.634
We're still good, right?

02:24.654 --> 02:26.637
Yeah. Why wouldn't we be?

02:26.672 --> 02:28.940
Nothing's changed.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.514
Everything's changed.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.586
Geez,
what'd the window ever do to you?

02:42.621 --> 02:45.222
Jade? What are you doing here?

02:45.256 --> 02:47.024
Well, Jack said I should come talk to you.

02:47.058 --> 02:48.826
Oh, yeah, right. He...

02:48.860 --> 02:50.461
He mentioned you might
be looking for a job.

02:50.495 --> 02:51.862
Yeah, I just got my license

02:51.896 --> 02:56.033
and I'll never be able to afford my own car
with my pathetic allowance.

02:56.067 --> 02:59.203
So do you have any experience
in the hospitality industry?

02:59.237 --> 03:00.838
Why would I?

03:00.872 --> 03:02.672
Because you're asking me for a job.

03:02.707 --> 03:04.845
Well, do you need my help or not?

03:04.865 --> 03:06.710
Okay.

03:06.744 --> 03:08.778
Let's see how you do washing windows.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.606
Wait. You want me to start like now?

03:13.658 --> 03:15.535
All four.

03:17.877 --> 03:19.356
Here.

03:19.390 --> 03:21.955
Is that for me?
Thank you, sweetheart.

03:21.975 --> 03:24.147
You're welcome, GG.

03:25.863 --> 03:29.098
Well, you know,
I would like to send this to Lisa

03:29.132 --> 03:31.767
'cause she's in France right
now and feeling real homesick,

03:31.801 --> 03:33.569
and I bet this would cheer her up.

03:35.939 --> 03:37.340
Where'd you get off to this morning?

03:37.374 --> 03:38.674
Uh, nowhere.
This is Amy's phone, right?

03:38.708 --> 03:41.210
Well, it doesn't matter
'cause it's not yours to answer.

03:41.245 --> 03:42.855
What if it's from Ty?

03:42.875 --> 03:44.158
Well, he'll call back.

03:44.178 --> 03:45.547
But what if it goes to voice-mail

03:45.582 --> 03:47.683
and then he thinks she's
ignoring him on purpose?

03:47.717 --> 03:50.259
What if Amy left her phone here on purpose?

03:51.788 --> 03:54.870
Thank you.

03:56.220 --> 03:57.829
Hello?

03:57.849 --> 04:00.429
Is it Ty?

04:00.463 --> 04:02.731
Sandra, hold on.

04:02.766 --> 04:05.901
Wait. What's wrong? What is it?

04:05.935 --> 04:07.668
That's Flirty and Disco.

04:07.703 --> 04:09.943
I made this video for my website.

04:09.963 --> 04:12.807
Wow! They are amazing together.

04:12.841 --> 04:14.771
So how long have you
been doing liberty work?

04:14.791 --> 04:15.676
For a while now.

04:15.711 --> 04:18.113
We even booked the halftime
show at the Longview rodeo.

04:18.147 --> 04:21.348
But now that Disco's injured,
I might have to cancel.

04:21.382 --> 04:22.850
What did the vet say?

04:22.885 --> 04:25.520
Torn suspensory ligament.

04:25.554 --> 04:27.855
At least six months off work. Maybe longer.

04:27.890 --> 04:30.224
That's rough.

04:30.258 --> 04:32.259
You know how long it
takes to train a liberty horse.

04:32.294 --> 04:35.195
I've probably spent more time with Disco
than I have with my husband.

04:35.215 --> 04:39.055
So? What can I do?

04:40.373 --> 04:43.801
The impossible. That's why I'm here.

04:45.290 --> 04:48.470
S08E05
Endings and Beginnings

04:48.625 --> 04:51.914
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

05:25.345 --> 05:27.880
You know,
he really is a good looking horse.

05:27.914 --> 05:30.946
Hustle? Yeah,
I picked him up at an auction last winter.

05:30.966 --> 05:33.351
He's really smart.

05:33.386 --> 05:34.687
Have you started working with him?

05:34.721 --> 05:37.589
We've tried,
but he didn't respond to me too well.

05:37.623 --> 05:40.993
And Longview's in three weeks, so...
good luck.

05:41.027 --> 05:43.695
Well, no promises, but I'll do my best.

05:43.729 --> 05:46.431
That's all I'm asking.

05:46.465 --> 05:49.133
Poor Flirty. His heart is broken.

05:49.168 --> 05:51.636
It's as bad as the worst break-up.

05:51.671 --> 05:53.837
Disco and Flirty didn't
just perform together,

05:53.857 --> 05:56.308
they were inseparable.

05:56.342 --> 06:00.969
Poor boy. It's rough, but life goes on.

06:04.475 --> 06:05.983
How's the pup?

06:06.018 --> 06:08.038
Actually, he's not doing too good.

06:08.058 --> 06:10.599
Yeah, orphan pups rarely do.

06:10.619 --> 06:12.228
He'd feed 24/7 if he could.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.761
Yeah. Total time suck.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.295
You know what this guy
needs is a surrogate.

06:18.330 --> 06:20.897
Or somebody to look after him,
but it's a full-time job.

06:20.932 --> 06:23.767
Well, any chance you can pull
some extra hours this week?

06:23.801 --> 06:26.002
Any chance there's a dollar
amount attached to that offer?

06:26.037 --> 06:28.706
Just think of the extra
experience as money in the bank.

06:36.408 --> 06:37.881
- Jade?
- Hey, kid.

06:37.915 --> 06:39.049
What're you doing here?

06:39.083 --> 06:40.751
I'm working for Lou, at the Dude Ranch.

06:40.785 --> 06:43.120
I'm trying to make some money
so I can get my own car.

06:43.154 --> 06:44.656
Apparently if you don't
have wheels around here,

06:44.676 --> 06:46.189
you have no social life.

06:46.224 --> 06:51.394
You have no idea how tough it is
being the new kid at school.

06:52.067 --> 06:54.264
Oh, wait. You probably do.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.267
But in high school it's way worse

06:57.301 --> 06:59.535
'cause everybody has their
own little cliques already.

06:59.570 --> 07:02.505
Well, maybe you just need to
try harder to make new friends?

07:02.539 --> 07:05.040
Like what, throw my own party? Yeah, right.

07:05.075 --> 07:06.508
My mom would be all like, "hey,

07:06.542 --> 07:08.110
it's so great to meet some
of Jade's new friends,

07:08.145 --> 07:09.979
who's up for some pop and chips?"

07:10.013 --> 07:12.114
I'd look like a total loser.

07:12.149 --> 07:15.084
At least people would know who you are.

07:17.432 --> 07:19.744
Good boy. Here...

07:20.318 --> 07:22.957
Good boy.

07:23.492 --> 07:25.126
He's doing pretty good.

07:25.161 --> 07:28.062
He seems fine on his own. Whoa...

07:28.097 --> 07:29.998
Let's see how he does with his new partner.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.267
All right.

07:32.301 --> 07:34.735
Okay, Hustle.

07:34.770 --> 07:36.537
Now, you two can learn to be buddies,
all right?

07:43.111 --> 07:45.780
Uh... or not.

07:45.814 --> 07:48.905
Well, I knew it would take some time.

07:48.925 --> 07:50.529
But I thought you
said you didn't have time.

07:50.549 --> 07:53.253
I don't.

07:53.288 --> 07:55.055
Let's try it again.

08:01.639 --> 08:03.111
Good boy.

08:03.131 --> 08:06.499
Come on, Flirty! No...

08:06.534 --> 08:08.535
You're supposed to work together.

08:08.569 --> 08:11.482
You expecting someone?

08:11.502 --> 08:14.274
That looks like Jesse Stanton's truck.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.476
Just what I need right now.
You wanna take him?

08:16.510 --> 08:18.244
- Here, yeah.
- Thanks.

08:25.586 --> 08:26.986
Hey there.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.955
I was in the area so I thought I'd stop by

08:28.989 --> 08:30.756
and say hi to my favourite horse whisperer.

08:30.790 --> 08:32.924
My answer's still no, Jesse.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.426
What do you mean?

08:34.461 --> 08:36.195
I'm not gonna work at Briar Ridge.

08:36.230 --> 08:38.998
Oh, yeah.
You, uh, you made that quite clear.

08:39.032 --> 08:42.201
So I found myself another
trainer and she is amazing.

08:42.236 --> 08:44.370
So you came all the way
out here to tell me that?

08:44.404 --> 08:46.137
Well, I thought I owed you fair warning.

08:46.172 --> 08:48.240
You're not the only game in town any more.

08:48.274 --> 08:50.709
You know, working with horses
is not a competition, Jesse.

08:50.744 --> 08:53.812
Everything in
life's a competition.

08:53.847 --> 08:55.280
But I prefer to keep it friendly,

08:55.314 --> 08:58.067
so... best of luck to you.

09:00.487 --> 09:03.154
So who is this other horse trainer?

09:03.189 --> 09:05.523
I don't know,
and I don't really care, to be honest.

09:05.557 --> 09:07.525
You sure sound like you do.

09:07.559 --> 09:08.693
Are you sure you're not
having second thoughts

09:08.727 --> 09:10.795
about turning down Jesse's offer?

09:10.829 --> 09:13.431
I just don't like how smug
he was about the whole thing.

09:16.235 --> 09:18.503
Hey! Ty.

09:18.537 --> 09:21.672
Hey.

09:21.707 --> 09:24.829
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:26.478 --> 09:29.747
Is, uh, is Georgie around here or...?

09:29.782 --> 09:33.484
Uh... Yeah, she is.

09:34.252 --> 09:36.120
Georgie?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.924
Ty!

09:40.457 --> 09:42.585
Hey.

09:43.528 --> 09:44.814
You said you wanted to help, right?

09:44.834 --> 09:47.932
- Uh-huh.
- 'Kay.

09:47.966 --> 09:51.814
Oh, Ty, are you kidding?

09:52.303 --> 09:54.070
Oh, but he's adorable.

09:55.807 --> 09:58.542
Hello!

09:58.576 --> 10:02.460
Oh my goodness, aren't you so cute?!

10:04.381 --> 10:08.551
Lou's right; He needs a lot
of care to build up his strength.

10:08.585 --> 10:11.120
We just...
we don't have the manpower right now.

10:11.155 --> 10:12.621
I don't know, Ty.

10:12.656 --> 10:15.425
I mean... he's a big responsibility.

10:15.459 --> 10:17.927
Come on, Lou. Look at him.

10:17.962 --> 10:20.396
You can't say no to that face.

10:20.431 --> 10:22.487
You're right, I can't.

10:23.108 --> 10:24.967
What's the drill, Ty?

10:25.001 --> 10:26.969
Keep him warm. Feed him as
much and as often as he'll take.

10:27.003 --> 10:29.905
Okay. I can do that.

10:29.940 --> 10:32.575
I know you can, Georgie,
but here's the hard part.

10:32.609 --> 10:35.062
He's a wolf, all right?

10:35.082 --> 10:38.681
And I know that human contact might
seem like a good idea in the short term.

10:38.715 --> 10:40.783
You can't let him imprint on you,
all right?

10:40.817 --> 10:42.817
The goal is to return him to the wild.

10:42.852 --> 10:45.153
All right. I get it.

10:45.188 --> 10:47.956
Feed him, keep him warm,

10:47.991 --> 10:49.491
and don't get too involved.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.994
I'm serious, okay?

10:52.028 --> 10:53.195
You have any problems, you give me a call.

10:53.229 --> 10:54.796
Okay. Will do.

10:54.830 --> 10:57.466
One last thing. He sleeps in his cage.

12:13.824 --> 12:16.314
Wake up, sleepyhead!

12:16.334 --> 12:18.907
It's a puppy!

12:19.863 --> 12:21.665
Perfect.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.772
No, Katie, not a puppy.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.668
He was in his crate most of the night,

12:25.702 --> 12:27.420
but then he started to cry.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.406
And what about what
Ty said about imprinting

12:30.440 --> 12:32.632
and reintegration back into the wild?

12:32.652 --> 12:35.411
- Aw-oaf!
- Uh, Katie, don't touch the puppy.

12:35.445 --> 12:36.939
Wolf.

12:36.959 --> 12:38.714
I know he said that,

12:38.748 --> 12:40.817
but he also said to keep him warm

12:40.851 --> 12:43.251
and feed him all the time.

12:43.286 --> 12:44.787
He's so cute!

12:44.821 --> 12:47.656
Come on...

12:47.691 --> 12:50.359
He doesn't even have a real mom.
I'm all he's got.

12:50.393 --> 12:52.027
What about not getting too attached?

12:52.061 --> 12:53.962
I'm not! But, Lou, he's just a puppy.

12:53.996 --> 12:55.506
A wolf puppy.

12:55.526 --> 12:57.366
- No, no, no, no...
- And from now on,

12:57.400 --> 13:00.768
this little guy is going
to be an outdoor wolf.

13:03.005 --> 13:05.707
don't look at me like that.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.709
You either.

13:12.514 --> 13:14.667
Damn poachers.

13:14.687 --> 13:16.917
This is incredible.
It looks like a healthy female, too.

13:16.952 --> 13:18.953
What a waste.

13:20.823 --> 13:23.253
So what do we do?

13:23.273 --> 13:25.526
That's the unbelievable part.
There's nothing we can do.

13:25.561 --> 13:27.547
Poaching is a sad reality, man.

13:27.567 --> 13:30.331
Well, it may be a reality,
but we gotta do something.

13:30.366 --> 13:31.866
We could call the police.

13:31.900 --> 13:32.867
Like how many times have
I tried that before?

13:32.901 --> 13:34.501
But what are they gonna do?

13:34.535 --> 13:36.045
Investigate.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.896
Look, there's no nock on the arrow.
A crossbow killed her.

13:39.942 --> 13:41.776
Check this out,
there's a cut in her abdomen.

13:41.810 --> 13:43.578
It looks like a surgical incision.

13:43.612 --> 13:46.250
Well, there's your story right there.
They removed her gall bladder.

13:46.449 --> 13:47.647
What for?

13:47.682 --> 13:49.683
Bear bile is worth its weight in gold.

13:49.717 --> 13:51.251
They use it in traditional
Chinese medicine.

13:51.286 --> 13:52.886
Wait. How is that legal?

13:52.920 --> 13:55.389
Well, it isn't.
But it makes big money

13:55.423 --> 13:56.890
through international smuggling.

13:59.260 --> 14:01.761
To them, life's cheap, Ty.

14:01.796 --> 14:04.598
Come on, let's move. We gotta bury her.

14:07.602 --> 14:09.903
That's it, here we go.

14:14.909 --> 14:17.844
Okay, I'm gonna try something simple.

14:17.879 --> 14:20.758
I want them to change
direction in the circle.

14:21.482 --> 14:25.141
Keep moving... That's right. Good!

14:28.155 --> 14:30.189
Settle... Settle. It's okay.

14:30.224 --> 14:32.091
Hey, hey. You're all right.

14:32.126 --> 14:34.060
Hustle! Easy.

14:34.094 --> 14:35.995
Whoa... Come on, boy.

14:36.030 --> 14:38.697
Well, hello, Sandra! How's it going?

14:38.732 --> 14:40.733
Not great. Hustle was game,

14:40.767 --> 14:43.301
but now even he's not cooperating.

14:43.336 --> 14:45.905
Yeah, Amy tells me you're
dealing with an injured horse.

14:45.939 --> 14:48.040
Yeah.
He'll be out of commission for months.

14:48.074 --> 14:50.743
Sorry to hear it.

14:50.777 --> 14:53.578
Looks like that guy might be
missing his significant other.

14:53.612 --> 14:56.248
I can relate. Lisa's out of town again.

14:56.282 --> 14:58.550
Oh yeah, I heard you got married!
Congratulations!

14:58.584 --> 15:00.318
Why thank you very much.

15:00.353 --> 15:03.717
Grandpa, I'm trying work these
horses and you are not helping.

15:06.571 --> 15:07.916
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

15:07.936 --> 15:09.380
No, that's all right.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.963
I'll leave you two to get at it.

15:15.434 --> 15:17.835
You know what, Sandra? I...

15:17.870 --> 15:19.804
I think, clearly, I need a break.

15:19.838 --> 15:22.406
Let's just let these guys have a moment.

15:22.441 --> 15:24.576
For sure. Whatever you think is best.

15:24.610 --> 15:28.812
Actually, what I think is
best is just to call it a day.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.814
Don't we wanna end on a positive note?

15:30.848 --> 15:34.118
Yeah, but I also don't wanna push it.

15:34.152 --> 15:37.388
Look. Amy, either they're gonna
gel as a pair or they won't.

15:37.422 --> 15:39.756
I'd rather know sooner than later.

15:39.791 --> 15:41.959
They may not be working perfectly together,

15:41.993 --> 15:43.961
but they're getting along a
lot better than yesterday.

15:43.995 --> 15:47.163
Really? What's this bite on his back?

15:47.198 --> 15:49.099
Yeah, Flirty nipped at Hustle,

15:49.133 --> 15:51.602
but I'm trying, I really am.

15:56.874 --> 15:59.309
I'm sorry, grandpa.
Not one of my better days.

15:59.343 --> 16:00.643
There's always tomorrow.

16:00.677 --> 16:03.279
Oh, something to look forward to.

16:03.314 --> 16:05.982
That's why you might wanna tell
Sandra what's going on with you.

16:06.016 --> 16:08.284
- What's going on with me?
- Mm-hmm.

16:08.993 --> 16:10.698
Do you mean with Ty?

16:10.718 --> 16:13.055
Grandpa, Sandra is a client, okay?

16:13.090 --> 16:15.253
I'm not gonna share my
personal issues with a cl...

16:15.273 --> 16:17.827
She's also your friend.

16:17.861 --> 16:19.629
Well, you don't have to go into detail,

16:19.663 --> 16:21.631
but that gray horse out there,

16:21.665 --> 16:24.066
that's not the only one who's got a partner

16:24.101 --> 16:26.868
that's suddenly gone missing.

16:31.374 --> 16:34.716
Yeah, bear bile's used to

16:34.736 --> 16:37.727
Fever, diabetes, heart disease.

16:38.448 --> 16:39.981
A single gall bladder can fetch anywhere

16:40.016 --> 16:43.051
from three to ten thousand dollars.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.086
Ten thousand dollars for a gallbladder.

16:45.121 --> 16:47.766
Yeah.
We are definitely in the wrong business.

16:56.008 --> 16:57.348
Hello.

16:58.775 --> 16:59.968
Hey, Georgie.

17:00.002 --> 17:03.718
Well, slow down a second.
What? What's wrong with him?

17:06.845 --> 17:09.388
Okay. I'll be right there. Okay.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.013
That was, uh, Georgie.

17:14.049 --> 17:15.616
She's the girl who's
looking after the wolf pup.

17:15.651 --> 17:16.817
She's having a little problem with him.

17:16.851 --> 17:18.117
I should just probably go check up on her.

17:18.153 --> 17:20.954
All right. Yeah, you can take off.
I can handle this myself.

17:20.989 --> 17:23.181
- You're sure?
- Oh yeah. Absolutely.

17:23.201 --> 17:25.862
Thanks, man.
All right, I'll be back in a bit.

17:25.882 --> 17:27.594
Yup.

17:27.627 --> 17:29.029
I got your message. What's up?

17:29.064 --> 17:30.463
Just after this morning,

17:30.498 --> 17:33.195
I... figured we needed to talk.

17:33.215 --> 17:34.467
Okay...

17:35.014 --> 17:36.243
It's just...

17:36.263 --> 17:38.146
Look,
I'm going through some personal issues.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.339
It's no big deal,

17:39.373 --> 17:41.908
but I feel like the horses
may have picked up on my mood

17:41.942 --> 17:45.292
and that's why the work's not
going as well as I'd hoped.

17:45.312 --> 17:46.746
Okay. Nothing serious, I hope.

17:46.780 --> 17:48.948
No. I'll pull through, I'm sure.

17:48.982 --> 17:51.251
It's just I might need a
little more time than I have

17:51.285 --> 17:52.985
and I know you need them right away.

17:53.020 --> 17:55.554
But I hear there's this
new trainer at Briar Ridge.

17:56.321 --> 17:58.925
- Oh, I know all about her.
- You do?

17:58.959 --> 18:00.827
Jesse Stanton's been calling
the past couple of days.

18:00.861 --> 18:02.995
I keep telling him I'm sticking with you.

18:03.030 --> 18:05.732
I do appreciate it,
but under the circumstances,

18:05.766 --> 18:08.197
maybe you should give her a try.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.335
You sure?

18:09.369 --> 18:11.537
Yeah. Yeah, you know what?
I'll haul your horses over there

18:11.571 --> 18:13.310
and that'll give me a
chance to talk with her

18:13.330 --> 18:15.618
and let her know how it's going.

18:15.638 --> 18:17.951
All right, if you think that's best.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.010
Thanks.

18:23.883 --> 18:26.352
So these are my new clients.

18:26.386 --> 18:28.286
Meet Flirty and Hustle.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.122
I just thought I'd come by
and talk to your new trainer

18:30.156 --> 18:32.791
- and fill them in on my progress.
- Oh, she is amazing.

18:32.825 --> 18:35.151
She'll take one look and figure them out.

18:35.171 --> 18:37.129
She's known, like, all over the world.

18:37.163 --> 18:40.232
Wow! You were able to get someone
that good to work for you?

18:40.266 --> 18:43.034
Well, I uh... I couldn't convince you.

18:43.069 --> 18:46.571
So...
you're saying I was your second choice?

18:46.605 --> 18:49.674
We, uh... We go way back,

18:49.708 --> 18:51.942
so I had to give her first crack,
as a courtesy.

18:51.977 --> 18:54.412
Allow me to introduce Tate Evans.
Tate, this is Amy...

18:54.446 --> 18:56.514
I know who Amy Fleming is.
She's the "Miracle Girl."

18:56.548 --> 18:58.483
Jesse here was explaining

18:58.517 --> 19:00.017
that you have quite the
background in liberty work.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.256
Yeah, I was a trainer at
a travelling horse show

19:02.276 --> 19:03.658
"Cheval Fantastique."

19:03.678 --> 19:06.984
Yeah, I know them. They're incredible.
They do amazing work with horses!

19:07.004 --> 19:09.140
I just got back from our European tour.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.894
Oh. Amy just got back from Europe as well,

19:10.928 --> 19:12.829
on the show-jumping circuit.

19:12.863 --> 19:14.831
Yeah, so anyway, I thought I would come by

19:14.865 --> 19:17.467
and show you the progress on these two.

19:17.502 --> 19:20.136
No need for that.
Sandra's coming by soon.

19:20.171 --> 19:22.772
I'd prefer to deal
directly with our client.

19:27.111 --> 19:28.644
So...
when did he stop drinking his formula?

19:28.679 --> 19:31.080
About an hour ago.

19:31.115 --> 19:33.605
Well, maybe he's just not hungry.

19:33.625 --> 19:36.533
Well, you said to call
if there was anything wrong.

19:36.553 --> 19:38.854
Yeah. But maybe he just needs
some more time to settle in.

19:38.888 --> 19:40.623
You gotta wait and see.

19:40.657 --> 19:43.258
Well, it's just...
I know him, Ty, okay?

19:43.293 --> 19:45.795
Ever since Lou banned him from the house,

19:45.829 --> 19:48.331
poor fang has been crying nonstop.

19:48.933 --> 19:50.169
Fang?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.000
That's his name.

19:54.743 --> 19:58.367
Well, he's not dehydrated.

19:58.942 --> 20:00.608
Maybe he's ready for some solid food.

20:00.643 --> 20:03.124
Well, what do they eat?

20:03.144 --> 20:05.214
In the wild,
his mom would digest their food

20:05.248 --> 20:06.715
and then regurgitate it up into her mouth,

20:06.749 --> 20:08.783
- and then the pups would lick it up.
- Gross!

20:08.818 --> 20:10.017
Well, that's nature for you.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.591
You know, maybe you could
liquefy some raw meat in a blender

20:16.625 --> 20:18.092
and try feeding it to him.

20:19.328 --> 20:21.522
Well, not with my mouth, right?

20:21.758 --> 20:23.383
You can use a spoon.

20:25.431 --> 20:30.838
You know, Lou is making
meatloaf for supper, if you want to stay.

20:30.873 --> 20:33.173
That sounds good,
but I'm gonna have to pass.

20:37.479 --> 20:39.446
Hey!

20:39.481 --> 20:41.849
How's the wolf pup?

20:41.883 --> 20:43.384
So far, so good.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.491
How's work?

20:48.930 --> 20:52.058
It's interesting. You?

20:52.093 --> 20:55.104
It's-it's good. Yeah, it's great.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.254
Well, I'll see ya.

21:11.245 --> 21:13.146
What? It's not like he came to see me.

21:26.272 --> 21:28.356
Jade?!

21:32.315 --> 21:33.965
Jade?!

21:38.615 --> 21:41.531
Jade! Jade!

21:41.742 --> 21:43.775
Jade!

21:43.810 --> 21:46.278
Dude!
You didn't have to yell in my ear.

21:46.313 --> 21:48.279
Apparently I did.
What do you think you're doing?

21:48.314 --> 21:50.048
I was just resting my eyes.

21:50.082 --> 21:51.817
I mowed the lawn like you said.

21:51.851 --> 21:55.019
You mowed half the lawn. Badly.

21:55.054 --> 21:56.888
Now get back out there and finish it.

21:56.923 --> 21:58.757
Chill out, Lou.

21:58.791 --> 22:00.058
Geez, I thought you'd be a cool boss.

22:00.092 --> 22:01.927
And I thought you wanted a job.

22:01.961 --> 22:04.795
Nobody wants a job. I need a job.

22:04.830 --> 22:07.432
Okay, well then you better
start taking this seriously.

22:07.466 --> 22:11.436
Yes, ma'am.

22:11.470 --> 22:14.405
Jade, come back here and remake this bed!

22:14.440 --> 22:16.975
What'd you find here, Sherlock?

22:17.009 --> 22:20.911
Trail of blood. It ends right here.

22:20.946 --> 22:24.404
See? There's more right there.

22:25.283 --> 22:28.586
So she must've run off
to where we found her...

22:28.620 --> 22:30.588
'cause there's more there...

22:32.911 --> 22:35.559
and more right there.

22:35.594 --> 22:39.817
So the bear must have been shot...
right around here.

22:41.632 --> 22:44.734
That camera, that a part of your security?

22:44.768 --> 22:46.436
Nope. Never seen it before.

22:46.471 --> 22:49.406
Well, someone put it there for a reason.

22:50.005 --> 22:53.442
Along with that.

22:53.477 --> 22:55.712
Look, Ty, come on.
Leave it, all right? Let's go.

22:55.746 --> 22:57.046
You said yourself the
poaching's been going on

22:57.080 --> 22:58.748
- for a while.
- Yeah.

22:58.782 --> 23:01.851
Well... that's how they get them here,

23:01.886 --> 23:03.953
and that's how they know
when they're coming.

23:03.988 --> 23:05.922
I'm gonna take a look at their pictures.

23:05.956 --> 23:08.124
Knock yourself out,
but I'm telling you, man,

23:08.158 --> 23:09.825
these poachers aren't
just a bunch of yahoos

23:09.859 --> 23:12.161
shooting deer out of season.

23:12.195 --> 23:15.331
Yeah, I get it, man,
but don't you want to stop this?

23:15.365 --> 23:17.299
Yeah, I do, but what I really
want is to go home after work

23:17.334 --> 23:20.403
in one piece, okay? And so should you.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.873
Hold on, Sandra.

23:37.997 --> 23:40.441
Look I wasn't getting anywhere either.

23:40.575 --> 23:42.819
Well, I couldn't connect.

23:42.839 --> 23:46.246
No, I'm sorry, I can't hehelp you.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.783
Bye.

23:49.321 --> 23:51.884
Sandra's not happy with Jesse's new trainer

23:51.919 --> 23:53.833
and she wants me to give it another try.

23:53.888 --> 23:55.288
So why don't you?

23:55.323 --> 23:58.591
Because I already failed once.

23:58.626 --> 23:59.692
Amy.

23:59.727 --> 24:01.193
Thank you.

24:03.564 --> 24:06.298
I can't stand seeing her like this.

24:06.333 --> 24:09.007
Since when has she ever
given up on a horse?

24:10.372 --> 24:12.238
Thank you.

24:12.272 --> 24:14.206
It is all about her and Ty,

24:14.241 --> 24:15.741
and we have to do something about it.

24:15.775 --> 24:17.609
- We do?
- Yes!

24:17.644 --> 24:20.079
Grandpa, this is important. I mean...

24:20.113 --> 24:21.580
I thought about talking to Ty myself,

24:21.614 --> 24:22.981
but what would I say? I...

24:23.016 --> 24:24.550
Well, what can anybody say

24:24.584 --> 24:27.353
about another person's relationship?

24:27.387 --> 24:30.522
Not just anybody. You. You, grandpa.

24:30.557 --> 24:32.524
You have that thing with Ty.

24:32.559 --> 24:35.827
You have that bonding relationship.

24:35.862 --> 24:37.963
You could talk to him
and make him understand

24:37.997 --> 24:40.799
that whatever happened with Ahmed...

24:40.833 --> 24:43.201
He's overreacting.

24:43.235 --> 24:46.404
They'll sort things out one way or another.

24:46.439 --> 24:48.039
But what if it's the wrong way?

25:00.159 --> 25:03.187
Oh, Jade, can you answer that please?

25:10.423 --> 25:11.937
Hello.

25:11.957 --> 25:14.196
Yeah, this is the Heartland
Equestrian Connection.

25:14.216 --> 25:16.494
This is Jade.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.244
Cancellation?

25:18.264 --> 25:20.378
You do know it's kind of late for that,
huh?

25:20.398 --> 25:22.974
I mean, there's no way you're
getting your deposit back.

25:23.008 --> 25:24.051
Jade!

25:24.071 --> 25:26.543
Well, maybe you should've
read the reservation agreement.

25:26.578 --> 25:28.185
Ja- You hung up?

25:28.205 --> 25:30.692
Listen, you cannot talk to
customers like that, okay?

25:30.712 --> 25:33.037
We rely on repeat business
and word of mouth.

25:33.057 --> 25:36.620
Well, you also rely on people paying you,
don't you?

25:36.654 --> 25:38.469
I mean...

25:38.489 --> 25:42.056
Now you just have three
cabins sitting there empty.

25:42.076 --> 25:43.127
But at least I get to call it a day, right?

25:43.161 --> 25:44.829
Yeah, nice try.

25:44.863 --> 25:46.563
With no guests,
that makes it the perfect day

25:46.598 --> 25:48.065
for a floor to ceiling cleaning.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.848
Hello.

26:04.882 --> 26:07.284
Hey, Jack. What's going on?

26:07.318 --> 26:09.185
Well,
I was just passing by

26:09.219 --> 26:12.122
and I figured that you
gotta know how to brew

26:12.156 --> 26:14.791
a half-decent cup of coffee by now.

26:14.825 --> 26:18.197
Come on in.
I'll grab you a cup.

26:18.217 --> 26:20.830
Take a seat.

26:20.865 --> 26:24.233
Well, what do you got going here?

26:24.268 --> 26:26.502
Just some images off a surveillance camera.

26:26.537 --> 26:28.795
The resolution sucks though.

26:31.074 --> 26:34.177
So... why are you really here?

26:34.211 --> 26:36.945
Oh, because of you.

26:36.980 --> 26:38.548
Because you're not just a guy

26:38.582 --> 26:41.349
who was gonna marry my granddaughter.

26:41.384 --> 26:43.952
Because you're family,

26:43.987 --> 26:47.475
and it's been that way from day one.

26:51.562 --> 26:53.896
For me too, Jack.

26:53.916 --> 26:57.345
Well... I didn't wanna get involved.

26:58.100 --> 27:02.103
But you and Amy, regardless of your issues,

27:02.137 --> 27:04.372
I bet you still love her

27:04.407 --> 27:07.475
and she's still wearing your ring.

27:07.510 --> 27:10.345
Of course I still love her.
Love is not the problem.

27:10.379 --> 27:13.348
Well, if it's got anything
to do with that prince fella...

27:13.382 --> 27:16.084
No, it has nothing to do with him.

27:18.187 --> 27:21.400
It has something to do
with what he said though.

27:22.825 --> 27:25.093
He said, I'm the one who holds her back,

27:25.127 --> 27:27.595
who prevents her from having a future.

27:27.629 --> 27:30.397
I don't wanna be that guy, Jack.

27:30.432 --> 27:34.911
He's right; Amy has huge potential, huge.

27:35.237 --> 27:38.305
She could do anything, go anywhere.

27:38.340 --> 27:40.841
She could travel the world if she wants to.

27:40.875 --> 27:43.380
That's her decision to make.

27:45.947 --> 27:47.313
I would rather lose Amy

27:47.348 --> 27:49.782
than be the guy who stands in her way.

27:55.106 --> 27:58.125
Amy! Sorry, I just need
to speak with you one more time.

27:58.159 --> 28:00.193
- Sandra...
- No, listen.

28:00.228 --> 28:01.828
I've seen you working with my horses,

28:01.863 --> 28:03.329
I know what you can do.

28:03.364 --> 28:05.798
But Jesse's trainer, Tate,

28:05.832 --> 28:09.269
none of what she's does
makes any sense to me.

28:09.303 --> 28:12.238
She started by lunging them
on the line separately.

28:12.273 --> 28:15.040
Then she had them stand
side by side for ages,

28:15.075 --> 28:17.310
smacking them with the whip if they
did the slightest aggressive move.

28:17.344 --> 28:19.279
Have you tried talking to her?

28:19.313 --> 28:22.381
I don't find Tate very... approachable.

28:22.415 --> 28:23.883
Well, then,
maybe you should be telling this to Jesse?

28:23.917 --> 28:25.751
Jesse Stanton is a businessman

28:25.786 --> 28:29.188
whose commodity just happens to be horses.

28:29.222 --> 28:30.756
Look,
I don't know what's going on with you,

28:30.791 --> 28:34.393
but quitting isn't something
that women like us do.

28:34.427 --> 28:36.195
A horse gets injured,
we do everything we can

28:36.229 --> 28:38.062
to get it back up on its feet.

28:38.097 --> 28:41.032
- We lose somebody we love...
- Okay, Sandra...

28:41.066 --> 28:44.503
No, you know what I've been through, Amy.

28:44.537 --> 28:47.272
You helped me pull my life back together.

28:47.307 --> 28:50.658
All I'm asking for is an
hour or two of your time.

28:52.745 --> 28:54.378
Get!

28:56.248 --> 28:57.315
Get!

28:58.217 --> 29:01.186
Get!

29:01.220 --> 29:03.054
I'm glad the training is going well...

29:03.088 --> 29:05.623
See what she's doing?

29:05.657 --> 29:07.658
Yeah, she's trying to control them.

29:07.693 --> 29:09.634
So the relationship is horse to trainer,

29:09.654 --> 29:11.429
not horse to horse.

29:11.463 --> 29:13.664
You see how she's using
the whip as a weapon?

29:13.699 --> 29:15.165
It-it should just be an
extension of your arm

29:15.200 --> 29:16.767
to encourage the horse forward.

29:16.802 --> 29:18.101
Hey-ah!

29:18.136 --> 29:20.037
Get!

29:20.071 --> 29:21.472
Good to see you, Sandra.

29:21.506 --> 29:24.342
I see you brought your friend.

29:24.376 --> 29:26.977
You know I wasn't convinced
about your new trainer, Jesse.

29:27.011 --> 29:29.512
I just wanted a second opinion.

29:29.547 --> 29:31.548
Amy's tried working with these horses

29:31.582 --> 29:33.851
and she couldn't get anywhere with them.

29:33.885 --> 29:37.332
But sure, let's hear what
the Miracle Girl has to say.

29:37.352 --> 29:40.824
Sandra can't do her act if she's trying
to control two horses separately.

29:40.859 --> 29:42.226
Okay, they have to learn to work together,

29:42.260 --> 29:44.361
to follow each others' cues,

29:44.395 --> 29:46.463
and Tate is not creating that bond,

29:46.497 --> 29:48.965
which is what she needs to accomplish.

29:48.999 --> 29:52.301
Okay, so...
what would you do differently this time?

29:52.336 --> 29:54.904
Well...
I'd turn them out in a field together.

29:54.938 --> 29:57.206
I'd let them bond and
get to know each other,

29:57.241 --> 29:59.075
and then I'd sit and watch their cues

29:59.109 --> 30:01.310
and use that to be their leader,

30:01.345 --> 30:04.313
not their trainer, not their boss.

30:04.348 --> 30:05.547
Canter! Move up!

30:13.935 --> 30:15.777
Hey, Georgie, what's up?

30:17.489 --> 30:19.351
He ate a what?

30:20.062 --> 30:23.682
Those squeaky toys are for dogs, Georgie.

30:24.367 --> 30:27.967
Remember what I told you?
The wolf is not a pet.

30:28.772 --> 30:33.041
Okay. I'll come by later.
My shift's almost done.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.877
Okay.

30:37.446 --> 30:40.719
Sounds like you should
take off now, man.

30:41.384 --> 30:45.420
You know, maybe giving that pup to that kid
might not have been the best idea.

30:45.454 --> 30:46.554
What're you talking about?

30:46.588 --> 30:49.023
Your judgment. No, I like you, Ty.

30:49.057 --> 30:51.225
You got a good heart.

30:51.259 --> 30:55.596
It's maybe too good to make the compromises
you gotta make in this job.

30:55.631 --> 30:57.904
There's a wolf sanctuary near Waterton.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.476
I'm gonna make some calls.

31:09.036 --> 31:12.313
Jesse, why are you following me?

31:12.347 --> 31:14.054
I realized you were right,
so I let Tate go.

31:14.074 --> 31:15.245
- Really?
- Yeah,

31:15.265 --> 31:17.418
and now I have no one to
work with Sandra's horses.

31:17.452 --> 31:19.119
Well, then hire someone else
'cause you're gonna have to anyway.

31:19.154 --> 31:21.121
Hey, I fired Tate on your recommendation.

31:21.156 --> 31:22.794
Obviously, I want you to work with them.

31:22.814 --> 31:25.692
- You are unbelievable.
- I'm doing you a favour.

31:25.726 --> 31:28.161
Sandra's your friend.
You already failed her once.

31:28.195 --> 31:29.529
If you don't finish what you started

31:29.564 --> 31:31.230
those horses are gonna
end up standing in a field

31:31.265 --> 31:33.867
a long way from the Longview Halftime Show.

31:33.901 --> 31:35.969
I'm just telling it like it is.
Suit yourself.

31:36.003 --> 31:38.103
Fine. Fine!

31:38.123 --> 31:41.165
Good. But even though she's your friend,
she's still my client, Amy.

31:41.185 --> 31:43.142
So you're working on my turf.

31:43.177 --> 31:45.110
See you bright and early at Briar Ridge.

31:53.653 --> 31:55.804
Good boy.

31:56.027 --> 31:57.393
Okay, come on.

31:59.329 --> 32:01.168
So he ate a toy?

32:01.317 --> 32:03.566
Well, he was playing, and...

32:03.600 --> 32:06.268
he only ate part of it
and then he spat it up.

32:06.288 --> 32:08.978
Georgie, he's a wolf,
he's not supposed to be playing with toys.

32:08.998 --> 32:11.053
I know, but...

32:11.073 --> 32:14.565
I love him and... I want him to be happy.

32:15.645 --> 32:18.821
Look, Georgie,

32:18.841 --> 32:21.783
you've done a great job
with this little guy so far,

32:21.818 --> 32:23.018
but you've gotten too close to him,

32:23.053 --> 32:25.351
and I warned you about that, right?

32:25.371 --> 32:27.089
That's why, when he has to leave,

32:27.123 --> 32:28.958
it's gonna be harder on the both of you.

32:28.992 --> 32:30.911
What do you mean, when he has to leave?

32:32.762 --> 32:33.895
Okay, so it's all set for tonight.

32:33.930 --> 32:36.631
I invited a bunch of people.

32:36.666 --> 32:39.668
Seriously, Beth, it's totally empty.
No one will know.

32:39.702 --> 32:41.070
Okay, I'll text you when my boss leaves.

32:41.104 --> 32:43.605
And invite everyone you know.

32:43.639 --> 32:45.107
Okay, so you don't know so many people.

32:45.141 --> 32:47.493
Just invite people who do know people.

32:47.513 --> 32:49.377
And by the way, my mom thinks I'm
staying at your house tonight,

32:49.411 --> 32:53.505
so cover for me, okay? Okay. Yeah.

32:53.914 --> 32:55.083
Jade?

32:55.117 --> 32:58.548
Are you, um, making personal
calls during business hours?

32:58.568 --> 33:00.012
Are you spying on me?

33:00.032 --> 33:02.502
No, but maybe I should be, and...

33:03.701 --> 33:05.026
You dropped this.

33:05.060 --> 33:07.261
So next time just use a linen bag, okay?

33:07.296 --> 33:09.129
Otherwise you're gonna leave
a trail of dirty laundry

33:09.149 --> 33:10.498
all the way to the car.

33:10.532 --> 33:12.633
Linen bag. Got it.

33:12.667 --> 33:14.469
Who's this?

33:17.398 --> 33:18.539
Can I help you?

33:18.573 --> 33:19.940
What?

33:19.975 --> 33:21.842
Turn down the music, please.

33:25.411 --> 33:26.647
Can I help you?

33:26.681 --> 33:30.885
We're looking for the...
Uh... highway.

33:30.919 --> 33:33.353
- The highway?
- Yeah.

33:33.388 --> 33:36.556
The highway is back the way you came.

33:36.590 --> 33:39.722
Right... uh, thanks.

33:42.163 --> 33:44.064
What was that about?

33:44.586 --> 33:46.699
I dunno.

33:51.139 --> 33:53.540
Here you go, buddy.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.307
It's not exactly what your mom would do,
but...

33:55.342 --> 33:57.512
it's close enough.

33:57.532 --> 34:00.051
How's he doing?

34:00.614 --> 34:04.258
Okay.
He likes the meatloaf.

34:06.486 --> 34:10.222
And how are you doing? Are you okay?

34:10.827 --> 34:12.158
I guess.

34:12.565 --> 34:16.635
It's just... I can't keep the wolf.

34:17.964 --> 34:21.467
Ty thinks I'm making too
much of an imprint with him,

34:21.501 --> 34:25.170
so he's found a wolf
sanctuary that'll take him.

34:25.204 --> 34:28.840
Maybe that's for the best.
I'm sure he was a lot of work.

34:28.860 --> 34:31.275
Well, kinda, but...

34:31.310 --> 34:34.246
all those problems, I made them up.

34:34.494 --> 34:35.947
Why?

34:36.567 --> 34:38.871
To give Ty... a reason.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.018
A reason to come here?

34:42.054 --> 34:47.745
Yeah, and maybe you guys would...

34:48.539 --> 34:49.194
Oh, Georgie...

34:49.228 --> 34:52.641
Well, what happened, it's all my fault.

34:52.661 --> 34:54.994
No. It is not your fault.

34:55.168 --> 34:56.873
This is my fault,

34:56.893 --> 34:58.836
and I'm the only one who can fix it.

35:06.211 --> 35:07.944
So, Jade,
is she working out any better?

35:07.979 --> 35:09.913
Absolutely, yeah.

35:09.947 --> 35:11.415
You know,
other than the fact that she's careless,

35:11.449 --> 35:13.617
lazy, unmotivated

35:13.651 --> 35:16.285
and frankly,
the worst employee I have ever had.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.287
That good, huh?

35:18.322 --> 35:21.157
Well, on the bright side,
she's learning. Slowly.

35:21.191 --> 35:23.459
Well, see? It's not all bad.

35:23.494 --> 35:25.543
No,
but I have to keep an eye on her 24/7.

35:25.563 --> 35:27.664
I mean, she's not exactly reliable.

35:27.698 --> 35:29.433
Well, give her a couple more days.

35:29.467 --> 35:31.334
You never know, she might surprise you.

35:31.368 --> 35:33.136
Or she might burn down the place.

35:33.170 --> 35:36.039
Why do you always assume the worst?
You can trust people...

35:36.073 --> 35:39.075
Oh, I do trust people. Just not Jade.

35:39.109 --> 35:42.892
Well, at least give her
a chance to prove you wrong.

35:47.984 --> 35:51.921
Awesome!
Let's make this fire enormous!

35:51.955 --> 35:54.990
Oh, Vince is here!
He almost ruined it earlier!

35:55.775 --> 35:57.159
Vince?!

35:57.193 --> 35:59.294
You and your loser friends
almost screwed everything up.

35:59.329 --> 36:01.430
Whatever. I totally covered.

36:01.465 --> 36:03.098
You nearly blew the whole thing.

36:03.132 --> 36:07.102
Relax, all right? We bought a keg.

36:07.136 --> 36:10.166
Okay, you're forgiven.
Guys, they've brought a keg!

36:11.787 --> 36:13.275
Everybody grab a beer!

36:13.309 --> 36:16.544
And somebody do something with this fire,
man. It's puny!

36:16.579 --> 36:18.180
Hi. I'm Jade.

36:18.214 --> 36:20.482
One, two, three!

36:23.652 --> 36:25.620
All right, who cares?!

36:25.654 --> 36:28.756
Guys, um, beer!
Like let's get this started.

36:41.336 --> 36:43.004
Hello?

36:46.437 --> 36:49.176
Caleb, is that you?

36:50.778 --> 36:52.446
Who is it?

36:52.481 --> 36:52.980
Ty borden?!

36:53.015 --> 36:54.314
Hey!

36:57.586 --> 36:59.853
If you keep
sticking your nose where it don't belong,

36:59.888 --> 37:01.688
you're a dead man!

37:01.723 --> 37:04.357
Ungh! Ungh! Ungh...

37:09.397 --> 37:12.066
All right, go be free.

37:15.747 --> 37:18.005
You wanna join him?

37:18.366 --> 37:21.257
All right.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.176
Hey, Georgie.

37:57.865 --> 38:00.045
Yeah, well, um...

38:00.079 --> 38:03.181
how about you take that little
guy out to the reserve today?

38:03.216 --> 38:06.418
Yeah, you can ask Jack for a ride.

38:06.452 --> 38:09.254
Well,
I'm-I'm just not really feeling up to it.

38:09.288 --> 38:12.725
Yeah, I'd come out to Heartland,
but not today.

38:13.461 --> 38:15.527
Okay, thanks.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.102
The camera.

39:20.905 --> 39:22.456
Wait up!

39:33.836 --> 39:35.400
What the...?

39:37.360 --> 39:39.408
Beat it!

39:53.495 --> 39:54.756
Jade?!

39:54.790 --> 39:58.829
Uh, Lou?
Um, okay... I know this looks bad-

39:58.849 --> 40:01.455
This looks more than bad!

40:02.373 --> 40:04.099
Okay, I'm really sorry.

40:04.134 --> 40:06.962
It was only supposed to be a few friends,
but then it got tweeted out

40:06.982 --> 40:08.401
to a bunch of people I've never even met!

40:08.421 --> 40:10.027
Tweeted out?!

40:10.047 --> 40:11.673
Jade!

40:12.156 --> 40:15.408
This is a serious breach of trust.

40:16.730 --> 40:18.559
I know. I'm fired.

40:18.579 --> 40:20.649
No, no, no, no. You're not fired.

40:20.683 --> 40:25.286
You are gonna clean up this
place until it looks brand new!

40:25.876 --> 40:27.557
And then you're fired.

40:45.602 --> 40:47.574
Good boy. Hey.

41:00.915 --> 41:02.389
Good boy.

41:05.482 --> 41:06.417
Good boy.

41:20.607 --> 41:23.050
Come on, now,
you knew this day was coming.

41:23.070 --> 41:24.155
I guess.

41:24.175 --> 41:26.053
It's because you did such a good job

41:26.073 --> 41:28.262
taking care of this guy that Ty says

41:28.282 --> 41:31.217
he's healthy enough to go
to a wolf sanctuary at all.

41:31.251 --> 41:34.920
- I'm gonna miss him so much.
- Well, you can visit.

41:34.954 --> 41:37.889
It's just-it's not gonna
be the same as seeing him everyday.

41:37.924 --> 41:40.792
Yeah, I don't think we're
talking about the wolf anymore.

41:41.301 --> 41:42.994
The thing is, Georgie,

41:43.029 --> 41:45.475
I don't know what's gonna
happen in the future,

41:45.495 --> 41:47.076
but Ty, he's family

41:47.096 --> 41:49.935
and we will always look out for him.

41:49.969 --> 41:52.403
On the phone,
he said he wasn't coming to Heartland.

41:52.438 --> 41:54.703
What do you think that meant?

41:54.852 --> 41:56.108
I don't know.

41:56.142 --> 41:58.243
He's probably never coming back here.

41:58.277 --> 42:01.046
Why would he,
if him and Amy aren't even talking?

42:07.984 --> 42:10.388
Well, I think they're finally ready.

42:10.422 --> 42:12.379
Oh, I don't how you did it,
but you did.

42:12.399 --> 42:13.881
That was amazing!

42:17.229 --> 42:21.687
Look, I don't mean to pry,
but that personal problem...

42:21.707 --> 42:23.280
Is everything okay?

42:23.300 --> 42:25.202
Nothing's really changed.

42:25.237 --> 42:26.737
Well, if something's bothering you,

42:26.772 --> 42:30.574
you'd never know it from what
you just did with my horses.

42:30.608 --> 42:33.764
You know, I have to say,
it did feel pretty amazing.

42:40.618 --> 42:46.371
Amy, can't say I'm surprised,
but you really came through.

42:46.632 --> 42:49.259
And I bet working here and seeing
what a great place this is,

42:49.294 --> 42:51.129
made you see things my way, right?

42:51.149 --> 42:52.929
So that was your plan all along.

42:52.963 --> 42:56.670
Get me working on "your turf"
so I couldn't possibly say no?

42:56.690 --> 42:58.159
Maybe.

42:58.179 --> 42:59.735
Well, my answer is still "no," Jesse.

42:59.770 --> 43:02.403
Oh, come on, Amy.
don't leave me in the lurch here.

43:02.423 --> 43:04.653
I fired my only trainer because of you.

43:04.673 --> 43:06.211
See you around.
