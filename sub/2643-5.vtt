WEBVTT

00:03.628 --> 00:05.582
All I'm saying is, if they
took all the money they spent

00:05.682 --> 00:07.149
trying to make
a decent Hulk movie,

00:07.150 --> 00:10.619
they could probably
just make an actual Hulk.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.571
That is apt and amusing.

00:13.189 --> 00:14.740
I think I shall share that

00:14.741 --> 00:16.441
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:16.442 --> 00:18.860
She'll appreciate
the witticism.

00:18.861 --> 00:20.245
Thank you.

00:20.246 --> 00:23.648
It'll also help improve her
initial impression of you.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.318
So what's going on with you two?

00:26.319 --> 00:29.254
Well, the status is
as it always was.

00:29.255 --> 00:31.156
She's a girl. She's a friend.

00:31.157 --> 00:32.256
She is not my--

00:32.258 --> 00:33.542
please forgive me
for doing this--

00:33.543 --> 00:35.160
"girlfriend."

00:35.161 --> 00:37.012
Right, right.

00:37.013 --> 00:40.015
So you're still just
texting and emailing?

00:40.016 --> 00:42.517
You don't feel any need
to hang out with her, you know--

00:42.518 --> 00:44.386
be in the same room?

00:44.387 --> 00:46.221
Leonard, you are
my best friend.

00:46.222 --> 00:48.623
I've known you
for seven years,

00:48.624 --> 00:51.560
and I can barely tolerate
sitting on the couch with you.

00:51.561 --> 00:55.697
Imagine my attitude regarding
prolonged physical proximity

00:55.698 --> 00:57.182
to Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:57.183 --> 00:58.867
Got it.

00:58.868 --> 01:01.703
I sense judgment on your part.

01:01.704 --> 01:03.004
No, no.

01:03.673 --> 01:05.624
Maybe a little.

01:05.625 --> 01:09.778
May I suggest that your
criticism is based on jealousy.

01:09.779 --> 01:12.597
Jealousy? What do I
have to be jealous of?

01:12.598 --> 01:15.450
I have a functioning
and satisfying relationship

01:15.451 --> 01:16.785
with a female.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.222
You have none.

01:20.223 --> 01:22.874
Oh, right. That.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.310
Jealousy is an ugly
green-eyed monster--

01:25.311 --> 01:26.445
not unlike the Hulk--

01:26.446 --> 01:29.347
who, by the way,
also has a girlfriend.

01:29.348 --> 01:31.549
In this iteration,
Jennifer Connelly,

01:31.550 --> 01:34.269
whom you may recall as
the girlfriend of Russell Crowe

01:34.270 --> 01:35.337
in <i>A Beautiful Mind,</i>

01:35.338 --> 01:38.890
a feel-good romp if
there ever was one.

01:40.026 --> 01:41.076
I'm not jealous.

01:42.695 --> 01:45.030
Leonard not jealous.

02:12.587 --> 02:14.488
You know, it just
occurred to me,

02:14.494 --> 02:17.747
if there are an infinite
number of parallel universes,

02:17.748 --> 02:20.750
in one of them,
there's probably a Sheldon

02:20.751 --> 02:24.170
who doesn't believe
parallel universes exist.

02:24.171 --> 02:26.555
Probably. What's your point?

02:26.556 --> 02:27.473
No point.

02:27.474 --> 02:28.808
It's just one
of the things

02:28.809 --> 02:30.593
that makes one of
the mes chuckle.

02:31.928 --> 02:35.014
What makes you
chuckle, Leonard?

02:35.015 --> 02:37.516
Hmm, recently?

02:37.517 --> 02:38.634
Not much.

02:38.635 --> 02:40.653
Is it because of the
conflict that arises

02:40.654 --> 02:42.971
from your desperate need
to pair-bond with a woman,

02:42.972 --> 02:45.191
and the apparent collective
decision of all womankind

02:45.192 --> 02:49.612
to deny you
that opportunity?

02:49.613 --> 02:51.080
Um...

02:51.081 --> 02:53.582
Shut up.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.984
You know,
when my grandfather died,

02:55.985 --> 02:58.454
and Meemaw was alone,
my mom arranged for her

02:58.455 --> 03:00.456
to visit a center
three times a week

03:00.457 --> 03:04.010
where she could socialize
with other lonely people.

03:04.011 --> 03:05.378
It's very nice.

03:05.379 --> 03:09.164
They discuss current events,
play bridge, get a hot meal.

03:09.165 --> 03:10.332
That sounds lovely.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.653
It is if you
like bridge.

03:13.654 --> 03:15.788
Do you like bridge,
Leonard?

03:15.789 --> 03:18.674
Sheldon, I'm just not
dating someone right now.

03:18.675 --> 03:22.728
I don't need to go
to a senior center.

03:22.729 --> 03:26.816
Meemaw resisted at first,
but now she loves it.

03:26.817 --> 03:30.352
Fine. If I don't meet someone
soon, you can put me in a home.

03:30.353 --> 03:31.687
It's not a home.

03:31.688 --> 03:33.823
It's a senior center.

03:33.824 --> 03:37.209
We'd never put
Meemaw in a home!

03:38.378 --> 03:39.378
Hey, guys.

03:39.379 --> 03:40.629
Hey.
Hey.

03:40.630 --> 03:45.000
All right, I'll bow
to social pressure: Hey!

03:46.219 --> 03:48.003
Excuse me. That's my girlfriend,
Bernadette.

03:48.004 --> 03:49.672
I assigned her
her own ringtone--

03:49.673 --> 03:51.257
"Bernadette,"
by The Four Tops.

03:51.258 --> 03:52.975
Hello, Bernadette.

03:54.211 --> 03:57.863
When I call him, his phone
plays "Brown Eyed Girl."

03:58.498 --> 03:59.598
Which, now that

03:59.599 --> 04:01.801
I think about it,
is not so good.

04:01.802 --> 04:04.403
You realize he's just
rubbing our noses in the fact

04:04.404 --> 04:06.038
that he has a girlfriend,
and we don't.

04:06.039 --> 04:08.190
You mean, <i>you</i> don't.

04:08.191 --> 04:09.392
You have a girlfriend?

04:09.393 --> 04:10.776
How could you have a girlfriend?

04:10.777 --> 04:12.244
You can't even speak to women.

04:12.245 --> 04:15.581
Two words-- deaf chick.

04:16.416 --> 04:17.583
It doesn't matter

04:17.584 --> 04:19.851
if I can't talk,
because she can't hear me.

04:19.853 --> 04:21.454
What?

04:21.454 --> 04:23.222
That's what she said.

04:24.841 --> 04:27.393
Great. You have a girlfriend,
Howard's got a girlfriend,

04:27.394 --> 04:28.761
Sheldon's got
a girl...
No, no, no, no!

04:28.762 --> 04:29.879
...who's a friend.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.914
Thank you.

04:31.915 --> 04:33.099
What about you, Stuart?

04:33.100 --> 04:34.600
You have a
girlfriend yet?

04:34.601 --> 04:35.851
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

04:35.852 --> 04:38.354
I met her at Comic-Con,
the one place in the world

04:38.355 --> 04:40.506
where saying
"I own a comic bookstore"

04:40.507 --> 04:42.258
is an actual pickup line.

04:42.259 --> 04:44.193
Oh. Well, good for you.

04:44.194 --> 04:46.295
Not really. She's horrible.

04:47.197 --> 04:48.714
When she wants to have sex,

04:48.715 --> 04:51.117
she puts on her plus-size
Wonder Woman costume and shouts,

04:51.118 --> 04:53.919
"Who wants to take a ride
in my invisible plane?"

04:55.288 --> 04:57.773
Why don't you just
break up with her?

04:57.774 --> 04:59.992
No, no, I can't.

04:59.993 --> 05:00.943
Why not?

05:00.944 --> 05:02.378
'Cause then I'd be alone,

05:02.379 --> 05:03.746
like you.

05:05.081 --> 05:07.466
Dude, why don't you just invoke
your girlfriend pact

05:07.467 --> 05:09.068
with Wolowitz?

05:09.069 --> 05:11.387
Because I don't
need his girlfriend

05:11.388 --> 05:13.806
to set me up with one
of her girlfriends.

05:13.807 --> 05:17.092
I'm perfectly capable of
finding a girl on my own.

05:17.093 --> 05:19.145
Oh, Leonard, you remind me

05:19.146 --> 05:21.313
of the funny old story
about a man

05:21.314 --> 05:23.299
who walks into a women's
correctional institution

05:23.300 --> 05:24.650
with a stack of paperwork

05:24.651 --> 05:27.186
that will allow
the female convicts to go free.

05:27.187 --> 05:29.088
You're saying I
couldn't get laid

05:29.089 --> 05:32.608
in a women's prison with
a handful of pardons.

05:32.609 --> 05:35.277
Are you going to let me
tell the story or not?

05:38.832 --> 05:40.483
Leonard?

05:40.484 --> 05:41.851
Are you sleeping?

05:41.852 --> 05:43.085
No.

05:43.086 --> 05:44.086
Are you ill?

05:44.087 --> 05:45.120
No.

05:45.121 --> 05:46.488
Are you still depressed

05:46.489 --> 05:48.791
because you're alone,
and no one loves you?

05:48.792 --> 05:51.277
I don't know. Maybe.

05:51.278 --> 05:53.629
I want you to know
that I'm genuinely concerned

05:53.630 --> 05:54.880
about your well-being.

05:54.881 --> 05:56.549
Thank you.
You're welcome.

05:56.550 --> 06:00.168
But it's still no reason
to have your feet in my spot.

06:01.721 --> 06:05.341
May I offer an observation?

06:07.143 --> 06:08.861
What the hell?
How long has she been here?

06:08.862 --> 06:11.647
Since we got home
from the comic bookstore.

06:11.648 --> 06:12.781
That was two hours ago.

06:12.782 --> 06:13.949
As per your suggestion,

06:13.950 --> 06:15.451
we're hanging out.

06:15.452 --> 06:16.518
Quite frankly, I don't see

06:16.519 --> 06:17.686
what all the hoopla's about.

06:17.687 --> 06:19.488
Go on, Amy.

06:19.489 --> 06:21.257
From a neurobiological
standpoint, Leonard,

06:21.258 --> 06:23.759
you may be alone
because your psychological state

06:23.760 --> 06:26.228
is causing
an actual pheromone-based stink

06:26.229 --> 06:27.880
of desperation.

06:28.899 --> 06:30.049
Did you know that, Leonard?

06:30.050 --> 06:31.800
No.
I did.

06:33.336 --> 06:35.237
I understand
that some people find mates

06:35.238 --> 06:37.706
in social gathering places
such as bars or taverns.

06:37.707 --> 06:39.575
Have you tried a bar or tavern?

06:39.576 --> 06:41.894
No, I'm not gonna try
to pick up a woman in a bar.

06:41.895 --> 06:44.063
Wise decision. You see, Amy,

06:44.064 --> 06:47.683
success at a bar is based
on classic male attributes

06:47.684 --> 06:50.653
such as height, strength,
attractiveness,

06:50.654 --> 06:53.555
the ability to hold one's liquor
and throw darts--

06:53.556 --> 06:54.823
separately or together.

06:54.824 --> 06:58.661
Leonard has none of these
attributes, right, Leonard?

07:00.614 --> 07:02.982
Right.

07:02.983 --> 07:04.583
That's not true of all bars.

07:04.584 --> 07:05.784
Juice bars, for example.

07:05.785 --> 07:07.786
Oh! Good point, Amy.

07:07.787 --> 07:10.039
Yeah, building
on your premise,

07:10.040 --> 07:12.091
Leonard could
frequent sushi bars,

07:12.092 --> 07:14.009
salad bars, oyster bars,

07:14.010 --> 07:16.378
the Apple Genius Bar...
What are you doing?

07:16.379 --> 07:18.213
Keep going. I'm listening.

07:19.316 --> 07:21.300
That was rude.

07:21.301 --> 07:23.118
He does it all the time.

07:23.119 --> 07:27.156
He's a cornucopia
of social awkwardness.

07:27.157 --> 07:28.524
Cornucopia.

07:28.525 --> 07:29.558
What a mellifluous word.

07:29.559 --> 07:31.410
Let's make that our word
of the day.

07:31.411 --> 07:34.597
Agreed. And we'll use
mellifluous tomorrow.

07:34.598 --> 07:37.399
Well, I have to void my bladder.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.685
It was nice spending this time
with you.

07:39.686 --> 07:41.053
Wait.

07:41.054 --> 07:42.254
I have a request.

07:42.255 --> 07:43.455
Yes?

07:43.456 --> 07:44.890
I'd like you to meet my mother.

07:44.891 --> 07:46.058
I see.

07:46.059 --> 07:47.826
Can I get back to you on that?

07:47.827 --> 07:49.578
Certainly. Good night.

07:49.579 --> 07:51.780
Good night.

07:55.585 --> 07:59.004
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, Leonard,

07:59.005 --> 08:01.674
Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

08:01.675 --> 08:04.376
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
Leonard, Leonard,

08:04.377 --> 08:05.628
Leonard, Leonard,

08:05.629 --> 08:06.828
Leonard, Leonard...

08:06.829 --> 08:08.263
Yeah, what?

08:08.264 --> 08:11.216
Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me
to meet her mother.

08:11.217 --> 08:12.418
Yeah. So?

08:12.419 --> 08:15.104
What does that mean?

08:15.105 --> 08:17.056
Well, you know
how you're always saying

08:17.057 --> 08:19.308
that Amy is a girl
who's your friend,

08:19.309 --> 08:20.476
and not your girlfriend?

08:20.477 --> 08:23.445
Uh-huh.
You can't say
that anymore.

08:25.348 --> 08:27.349
Wait. What?

08:27.350 --> 08:28.517
Look, she obviously wants

08:28.518 --> 08:30.803
to take your relationship
to the next level.

08:30.804 --> 08:32.520
I don't want
the next level.

08:32.522 --> 08:34.539
I like this level.

08:34.541 --> 08:36.125
Fix it for me!

08:36.126 --> 08:37.859
Me?

08:37.860 --> 08:39.695
Well, how am I supposed
to fix it?

08:39.696 --> 08:41.547
Simple! You want a girlfriend,

08:41.548 --> 08:43.332
Amy wants
to be someone's girlfriend.

08:43.332 --> 08:46.301
Take her off my hands.
I give you my blessing.

08:46.302 --> 08:48.253
That is insane.

08:48.254 --> 08:49.838
You're right.
It would never work.

08:49.839 --> 08:51.473
Amy finds you tedious.

08:51.474 --> 08:53.225
Okay, good luck.

08:53.226 --> 08:55.377
Wait! What am I
supposed to do?

08:55.378 --> 08:58.147
Well, have you considered
telling her how you feel?

08:58.148 --> 09:01.934
Leonard, I'm a physicist,
not a hippie.

09:03.069 --> 09:04.603
All right, well, let me see

09:04.604 --> 09:06.905
if I can explain your situation
using physics.

09:06.906 --> 09:08.607
What would you be

09:08.608 --> 09:10.559
if you were attached
to another object

09:10.560 --> 09:14.897
by an inclined plane wrapped
helically around an axis?

09:14.898 --> 09:16.298
Screwed.

09:19.369 --> 09:21.503
There you go.

09:24.207 --> 09:25.624
Amy's right.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.293
He is tedious.

09:31.914 --> 09:36.602
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, get the door!

09:36.603 --> 09:38.554
Why can't you get it?

09:38.555 --> 09:41.023
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
You know I'm doing a bowel cleanse

09:41.024 --> 09:44.726
for my colonoscopy!

09:44.727 --> 09:48.831
I'm like an upside-down
volcano here.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.668
Oh, hey.

09:52.669 --> 09:54.420
I hope you didn't hear that.

09:54.421 --> 09:56.538
The volcano thing? No.

09:56.539 --> 09:58.924
What's with the T-shirt?

09:58.925 --> 10:00.426
You working at the
Apple store now?

10:00.427 --> 10:02.678
No, it's just something
I threw on.

10:02.679 --> 10:03.962
I know all your shirts.

10:03.963 --> 10:05.380
That's not one of them...

10:05.381 --> 10:07.800
You were pretending to
work at the Genius Bar

10:07.801 --> 10:09.501
to pick up women,
weren't you?

10:09.502 --> 10:12.671
Yeah.

10:13.490 --> 10:15.224
Turns out,
they guard the iPods,

10:15.225 --> 10:17.359
but they don't
guard the shirts.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.061
So, how'd it go?

10:19.062 --> 10:20.179
It was going well.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.930
I was showing
this super hot girl

10:21.931 --> 10:23.649
how to boot up in Safe Mode.

10:23.650 --> 10:27.052
The manager got suspicious,
and, well, long story short,

10:27.053 --> 10:30.656
they really do have
a little jail in the mall.

10:30.657 --> 10:34.176
Just FYI, don't try to go
back with a fake mustache.

10:34.177 --> 10:36.295
I mean, they may not
really be geniuses,

10:36.296 --> 10:38.564
but they see
right through that.

10:38.565 --> 10:41.517
I want to invoke
the girlfriend pact, Howard.

10:41.518 --> 10:42.718
You that desperate?

10:42.719 --> 10:44.820
No, I just...
I want what you have.

10:44.821 --> 10:47.122
You know, I want
a woman in my life.

10:47.123 --> 10:48.757
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Holy Moses,

10:48.758 --> 10:52.177
how much liquid can
be in one tokus?

10:55.014 --> 10:58.233
To be clear, I meant like
Bernadette, not your mother.

10:58.234 --> 11:00.803
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

11:05.086 --> 11:06.820
Well, I'm off to meet
Bernadette's friend.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.174
How do I look?

11:09.376 --> 11:10.477
As if one of the plants

11:10.478 --> 11:12.245
from
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>

11:12.246 --> 11:14.013
duplicated you in every way,

11:14.014 --> 11:16.783
only with an absurd
amount of hair gel.

11:17.568 --> 11:19.185
What are you
working on?

11:19.186 --> 11:21.104
I'm removing
my digital footprint

11:21.105 --> 11:22.255
from the Internet

11:22.256 --> 11:24.207
so Amy Farrah Fowler
can't find me

11:24.208 --> 11:26.876
and compel me to meet her mother.
Ah.

11:26.877 --> 11:28.294
You're going off the grid.

11:28.295 --> 11:29.362
Exactly.

11:29.363 --> 11:32.665
The old Unabomber approach.
Kudos.

11:32.666 --> 11:33.967
Thank you.

11:33.968 --> 11:37.387
I've also sent Amy a
relationship termination notice

11:37.388 --> 11:41.141
and changed my cell phone number
and e-mail address.

11:41.142 --> 11:42.892
What if she just comes over?

11:42.893 --> 11:43.893
She'll get lost.

11:43.894 --> 11:46.696
We no longer live
at 2311 Los Robles.

11:46.697 --> 11:51.785
We now live at 311 Los Robles.

11:53.821 --> 11:56.239
You changed the address
on the building?

11:56.240 --> 11:57.390
What about mail?

11:57.391 --> 11:59.409
Oh, no worries--
I explained my predicament

11:59.410 --> 12:00.560
to our letter carrier.

12:00.561 --> 12:01.611
He was sympathetic.

12:01.612 --> 12:02.912
His exact words were:

12:02.913 --> 12:04.280
"Got your back, Jack.

12:04.281 --> 12:06.683
Bitches be crazy."

12:12.556 --> 12:13.957
Who is it?

12:13.958 --> 12:15.675
Amy Farrah Fowler.

12:18.579 --> 12:20.797
Darn! She found me!

12:20.798 --> 12:22.682
She's been here before.

12:23.968 --> 12:27.103
The only flaw in an
otherwise perfect plan.

12:28.939 --> 12:30.140
Now, get my back, Jack.

12:30.141 --> 12:32.392
What do you want to do?
Tell her I'm not here.

12:32.393 --> 12:34.144
Okay, where are you?
I don't know.

12:34.145 --> 12:35.562
You'll have to devise a scenario

12:35.563 --> 12:37.063
that plausibly
explains my absence,

12:37.064 --> 12:41.868
keeping in mind that the key to
a good lie lies in the details.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.074

12:53.998 --> 12:55.248
Hi, Amy.

12:55.249 --> 12:56.633
Sheldon's not here.

12:56.634 --> 12:58.234
All right.

13:03.591 --> 13:05.958
Way to go on the details.

13:07.895 --> 13:10.480
Thanks again for
doing this, Bernadette.

13:10.481 --> 13:12.148
Oh, I take pacts
very seriously.

13:12.149 --> 13:14.467
One time at my lab,
a petri dish

13:14.468 --> 13:16.486
of genetically modified
super-virus went missing.

13:16.487 --> 13:19.138
That day we made a pinky swear
never to admit

13:19.139 --> 13:21.491
we crossed Ebola
with the common cold.

13:22.576 --> 13:24.410
Why the hell

13:24.411 --> 13:27.163
would you cross Ebola
with the common cold?

13:27.164 --> 13:28.781
We never did.

13:28.782 --> 13:32.652
That would be
a terrible, terrible thing.

13:33.837 --> 13:35.838
Hi. Sorry I'm late--
I was at the gym.

13:35.839 --> 13:39.292
Spin class--
worked up quite a sweat.

13:42.263 --> 13:45.014
Joy, this is Leonard.
Leonard, this is Joy.

13:45.015 --> 13:46.099
Hi.
Hi.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.634
You don't look
like a genius.

13:47.635 --> 13:48.768
Go ahead, say
something smart.

13:48.769 --> 13:50.653
Uh...
Aah! Time's up.

13:51.939 --> 13:53.106
Just kidding.

13:53.107 --> 13:55.108
First thing you need
to know about me:

13:55.109 --> 13:56.526
I'm hilarious.

13:58.362 --> 14:00.113
Yeah.

14:00.114 --> 14:01.397
So, Bernadette tells me

14:01.398 --> 14:03.783
she knows you from
self-defense classes?

14:03.784 --> 14:05.785
Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga.

14:05.786 --> 14:07.003
Lots of fun.

14:07.004 --> 14:08.871
Basically,
a hundred different ways

14:08.872 --> 14:11.023
to rip a guy's nuts off.

14:11.926 --> 14:13.693
Wow. Wouldn't think there'd

14:13.694 --> 14:14.961
be that many.
Number 42!

14:14.962 --> 14:16.496
Whoa!

14:16.497 --> 14:18.331
Isn't she a pip?

14:25.506 --> 14:28.708
Proxima Centauri's
the nearest star.

14:28.709 --> 14:31.928
The celestial bodies
that follow are

14:31.929 --> 14:34.347
Alpha Centauri A, Toli,

14:34.348 --> 14:36.048
Barnard's Star,

14:36.049 --> 14:38.234
Wolf 359...

14:42.823 --> 14:45.074
Lalande 21185,

14:45.075 --> 14:47.076
Sirius A, Sirius B,

14:47.077 --> 14:50.580
BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti,

14:50.581 --> 14:52.898
Ross 154...

14:52.899 --> 14:55.084
Ross 248...

14:56.754 --> 14:58.588
Epsilon Eridani,

14:58.589 --> 15:01.057
Lac-9352,

15:01.058 --> 15:02.342
Ross 128,

15:02.343 --> 15:04.227
Procyon A...

15:04.228 --> 15:06.796
Oh, darn, that's wrong!

15:11.735 --> 15:14.070
EZ Aquarii A,

15:14.071 --> 15:16.039
EZ Aquarii B,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.641
EZ Aquarii C,

15:18.642 --> 15:21.277
Procyon A.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.630
Those are the stars
that are nearest to me.

15:24.631 --> 15:27.450
Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee.

15:31.455 --> 15:33.489
Oh, dear.

15:34.491 --> 15:37.543
They really do be crazy.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.752
This lobster's good
on the way down

15:45.753 --> 15:47.587
and the way up.

15:48.722 --> 15:51.457
Should be-- it's
$30 a pound.

15:52.476 --> 15:55.628
Hey, this is a date, right?

15:56.630 --> 15:57.764
Yep, it is.

15:57.765 --> 15:59.232
73!
Whoa!

16:00.818 --> 16:04.520
Excuse me, I have to go
to the little girls' room...

16:04.521 --> 16:06.072
and take a wicked whiz.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.241
I'll go with you.

16:08.242 --> 16:10.243
Fair warning--
I had the asparagus.

16:10.244 --> 16:13.062
My pea is gonna
stink up the place.

16:14.715 --> 16:16.582
I think she likes you.

16:20.537 --> 16:23.790
EZ Aquarii B...

16:23.791 --> 16:25.758
EZ Aquarii C...

16:33.350 --> 16:35.968
Excuse me, madam.

16:36.970 --> 16:38.187
Sheldon?

16:38.188 --> 16:40.523
Rats!

16:40.524 --> 16:44.227
I believe a misunderstanding
may have occurred

16:44.228 --> 16:46.479
when I asked you
to meet my mother.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.780
No misunderstanding.

16:47.781 --> 16:50.233
I've learned what that
request actually means,

16:50.234 --> 16:53.119
and I don't want to be
joined to another object

16:53.120 --> 16:56.923
by an inclined plane wrapped
helically around an axis.

16:56.924 --> 16:59.125
In what way are
you screwed?

17:00.527 --> 17:03.563
All I want to do is present you
as my boyfriend to my mother

17:03.564 --> 17:05.798
so she'll be satisfied
that I'm in a relationship.

17:06.633 --> 17:08.800
So we'd be
perpetrating a ruse?

17:08.801 --> 17:10.236
Precisely.

17:10.237 --> 17:13.873
And you haven't fallen
hopelessly in love with me?

17:13.874 --> 17:15.675
Don't be absurd.

17:16.810 --> 17:18.578
I find the notion
of romantic love

17:18.579 --> 17:20.246
to be an unnecessary
cultural construct

17:20.247 --> 17:22.582
that adds no value to
human relationships.

17:22.583 --> 17:26.102
Amy Farrah Fowler, that's
the most pragmatic thing

17:26.103 --> 17:28.421
anyone has ever said to me.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.990
I trust this clarification
allows us to return

17:30.991 --> 17:34.093
to boy-slash-friend-slash-
girl-slash-friend status.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.411
Of course.

17:35.412 --> 17:38.047
Would you like to join me
for Chinese food?

17:38.048 --> 17:40.666
Sheldon, please,
you're suffocating me.

17:42.369 --> 17:44.069
My apologies.

17:44.070 --> 17:47.089
Good night, Amy.
Good night, Sheldon.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.659
Come on, just
give her a chance.

17:49.660 --> 17:51.527
Maybe she'll grow on you.

17:51.528 --> 17:55.681
Or maybe she'll finally succeed in
ripping my nuts off.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.852
There are still 93 ways
she hasn't tried yet.

17:59.853 --> 18:01.838
Look, H-Howard,
I appreciate

18:01.839 --> 18:04.957
the effort, but this is, like,
the worst date of my life.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.392
Seriously?

18:06.393 --> 18:10.196
I was once robbed by a pre-op
transsexual I met on J-Date,

18:10.197 --> 18:13.399
and that didn't
even crack my top ten.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.486
I guess the difference is,
I have some self-respect.

18:16.487 --> 18:19.388
Not that I've ever seen.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.073
It's relatively new.

18:21.074 --> 18:22.708
I just know that

18:22.709 --> 18:25.244
I'm not gonna spend time
with someone I don't like

18:25.245 --> 18:26.829
simply to have a girlfriend.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.247
I'm okay on my own.

18:28.248 --> 18:32.117
Good news-- I made
lots of room for dessert.

18:33.303 --> 18:36.121
Look, uh, Joy, it was nice
to meet you, but...

18:36.122 --> 18:38.424
Yeah, you, too.
Hey, you got anything for next weekend?

18:38.425 --> 18:40.243
I need a date for
my cousin's wedding.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.594
You're asking me out?

18:41.595 --> 18:42.628
Yeah.

18:42.629 --> 18:43.930
And it's an open bar,

18:43.931 --> 18:46.983
so I'll probably
be giving it away.

18:49.069 --> 18:51.604
I look forward to it.

18:57.959 --> 19:00.144
MRS. FOWLER
It's nice to meet you, too, Sheldon.

19:00.218 --> 19:01.886
I honestly didn't believe Amy

19:01.887 --> 19:04.478
when she told me
she had a boyfriend.

19:05.288 --> 19:07.608
I assure you I am quite real

19:07.611 --> 19:11.147
and I'm having regular intercourse
with your daughter.

19:12.149 --> 19:14.167
What?

19:14.168 --> 19:15.418
Oh, yes.

19:15.419 --> 19:18.621
We're like wild
animals in heat.

19:18.622 --> 19:21.891
It's a wonder neither
of us has been hurt.

19:21.892 --> 19:24.894
Amy... what is he saying?

19:24.895 --> 19:27.847
You wanted me to have
a boyfriend, Mother.

19:27.848 --> 19:29.916
Well, here he is.

19:32.603 --> 19:34.070
Have to sign off now.

19:34.071 --> 19:36.839
My hunger for Sheldon
is stirring in my loins.

19:38.192 --> 19:40.593
Oh, yes, it's time
for me to make love

19:40.594 --> 19:42.061
to your daughter's vagina.

19:46.567 --> 19:49.068
Thank you, Sheldon,
that went very well.

19:49.069 --> 19:50.620
Agreed.

19:50.621 --> 19:52.789
Amy, I find
myself wondering

19:52.790 --> 19:55.324
if we should actually
engage in coitus

19:55.325 --> 19:58.027
at least one time
in our relationship.

19:58.712 --> 20:00.580
Bazinga.

20:02.049 --> 20:04.217
Bedtime. Please
show yourself out.
