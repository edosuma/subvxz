01:28.796 --> 01:32.698
Continuing today's
hearing on future VA funding...

01:32.700 --> 01:34.765
the Senate Committee on
Veterans' Affairs...

01:34.767 --> 01:36.434
is called back to order.

01:36.436 --> 01:37.902
We'll hear from our
next witness.

01:37.904 --> 01:40.240
Will you please stand
and raise your right hand?

01:45.945 --> 01:48.679
My apologies.

01:48.681 --> 01:51.515
Please raise your right hand.

01:51.517 --> 01:53.651
Do you swear that the testimony
you're about to give...

01:53.653 --> 01:55.386
this committee will be the
truth, the whole truth...

01:55.388 --> 01:57.556
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

01:57.558 --> 01:58.624
I do.

01:58.626 --> 02:00.726
Please state your name.

02:00.728 --> 02:05.363
Private First Class Adam Green,
United States Army, retired.

02:05.365 --> 02:07.798
Mr. Green, I understand you've
prepared a statement?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.333
I have, sir.

02:09.335 --> 02:11.738
You may enter it into the record
at this time.

02:22.882 --> 02:27.621
Mr. Chairman, members of the
Committee...

02:29.623 --> 02:31.623
I want to thank you
for the opportunity...

02:31.625 --> 02:33.524
to speak with you today.

02:33.526 --> 02:35.863
I served in the military f...

02:39.799 --> 02:43.468
I'm sorry, if I could just...

02:43.470 --> 02:46.538
Sure, go ahead.

02:46.540 --> 02:47.642
Thank you, sir.

02:54.381 --> 02:57.683
I've always liked numbers.

02:57.685 --> 03:00.351
Whenever I have a hard time
wrapping my head around...

03:00.353 --> 03:04.922
something, I find that numbers
make things clearer for me.

03:04.924 --> 03:07.859
They help me understand
decisions that are made...

03:07.861 --> 03:11.698
and the impacts of those
decisions.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.700
So, if it's all right...

03:14.702 --> 03:19.470
I'd like the start with the
number 1.4 million.

03:19.472 --> 03:21.005
That's the number of men
and women...

03:21.007 --> 03:24.776
who are currently serving
in our military.

03:24.778 --> 03:27.712
555...

03:27.714 --> 03:30.481
that's how many days passed
before we invaded one country...

03:30.483 --> 03:34.518
after having been attacked
by another.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.691
19... is how old I was when
I enlisted.

03:40.361 --> 03:43.028
Three is the number of hours
that passed from the time...

03:43.030 --> 03:45.463
I arrived in Iraq to the time
our transport...

03:45.465 --> 03:47.099
was destroyed by an I.E.D.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.070
And then there's six.

03:52.038 --> 03:54.772
That's the number of inches the
piece of shrapnel was...

03:54.774 --> 03:56.777
that severed my spinal cord.

04:02.482 --> 04:05.585
The only problems with numbers
is they can be impersonal.

04:07.954 --> 04:11.490
A decision you made had a
life-changing impact on me...

04:11.492 --> 04:13.859
and a lot of soldiers like me.

04:13.861 --> 04:16.128
Now, I'm not a military expert.

04:16.130 --> 04:19.964
I don't know a whole lot
about geopolitical affairs.

04:19.966 --> 04:22.433
I'm just an ordinary American.

04:22.435 --> 04:24.034
And I understand that you've
asked me here...

04:24.036 --> 04:26.871
because you all have
some questions for me,

04:26.873 --> 04:32.746
but if it's all right, I'd like
to ask all of you a question.

04:39.752 --> 04:41.688
How the hell did this happen?

04:43.423 --> 04:46.825
<i>My fellow citizens,
at this hour...</i>

04:46.827 --> 04:49.693
<i>American and coalition forces
are in the early stages...</i>

04:49.695 --> 04:53.498
<i>of military operations
to disarm Iraq, to free...</i>

04:53.500 --> 04:57.135
<i>its people and to defend
the world from grave danger.</i>

04:57.137 --> 04:59.537
<i>The start of the
campaign called Shock and Awe.</i>

04:59.539 --> 05:01.005
<i>Shock and Awe.</i>

05:01.007 --> 05:02.940
- <i>Shock and Awe.</i>
- <i>Shock and Awe, indeed.</i>

05:02.942 --> 05:04.775
<i>Air raid sirens
are going off in Baghdad...</i>

05:04.777 --> 05:06.477
<i>The massive
military operation...</i>

05:06.479 --> 05:08.113
<i>to topple Saddam Hussein
is now in effect.</i>

05:08.115 --> 05:09.981
<i>Firing 600 Cruise missiles...</i>

05:09.983 --> 05:12.017
<i>and every type of war plane
in the American arsenal.</i>

05:12.019 --> 05:14.085
<i>A fearsome display
of American military might.</i>

05:14.087 --> 05:16.053
<i>The scale of this attack...</i>

05:16.055 --> 05:17.923
<i>is considerably higher than
anything we've seen before.</i>

05:17.925 --> 05:19.825
<i>We're taking out
whole buildings...</i>

05:19.827 --> 05:21.226
<i>with these Cruise missiles.</i>

05:21.228 --> 05:22.928
<i>U.S. war planes unleashed...</i>

05:22.930 --> 05:25.229
<i>to promise massive bombardment
of Baghdad.</i>

05:25.231 --> 05:27.731
<i>3,000 Tomahawk
Cruise missiles...</i>

05:27.733 --> 05:30.801
<i>satellite-guided precision
bombs, laser-guided bombs.</i>

05:30.803 --> 05:32.671
<i>I think the
citizens of Baghdad know...</i>

05:32.673 --> 05:35.573
<i>exactly what the Pentagon
means by Shock and Awe.</i>

05:35.575 --> 05:37.508
<i>Just over the
Kuwait-Iraq border...</i>

05:37.510 --> 05:40.544
<i>we watched as columns of troops
moved into the country.</i>

05:40.546 --> 05:41.613
<i>They're well on their
way to Baghdad.</i>

05:41.615 --> 05:43.181
<i>They have met resistance.</i>

05:43.183 --> 05:45.049
<i>We can't leave the
television...</i>

05:45.051 --> 05:49.721
<i>every tank, every helicopter...
is that my son?</i>

05:49.723 --> 05:52.190
<i>Now Baghdad is
within striking distance...</i>

05:52.192 --> 05:54.092
<i>just a few short miles away...</i>

05:54.094 --> 05:57.094
<i>as U.S. troops make their final
push forward.</i>

05:57.096 --> 05:59.563
<i>We want to slaughter
them all...</i>

05:59.565 --> 06:02.534
<i>those invaders, their tombs
will be here in Iraq.</i>

06:02.536 --> 06:04.803
<i>If Saddam Hussein
is alive, he is quote...</i>

06:04.805 --> 06:08.272
<i>"Not in control of his military
and of his government."</i>

06:08.274 --> 06:10.909
<i>These are opening stages
of what will be a broad...</i>

06:10.911 --> 06:11.913
<i>and concerted campaign.</i>

06:13.113 --> 06:15.115
<i>Could be longer and more
difficult than some predict.</i>

06:16.817 --> 06:19.149
<i>And helping Iraqis achieve
a united, stable...</i>

06:19.151 --> 06:23.587
<i>and free country will require
our sustained commitment.</i>

06:23.589 --> 06:27.291
<i>And you can know that our
forces will be coming home...</i>

06:27.293 --> 06:29.863
<i>as soon as their work is done.</i>

06:33.666 --> 06:35.769
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Let's go!

06:38.805 --> 06:40.772
- Where are they taking us?
- Shut up. Head down.

06:40.774 --> 06:42.741
Keep your mouth shut or I'll
blow your fucking head off.

06:42.743 --> 06:44.808
- All right, all right.
- Are you a soldier?

06:44.810 --> 06:46.645
- Journalist.
- Who do you work for?

06:46.647 --> 06:48.580
- Knight Ridder.
- Never heard of it.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.151
You should read more.

06:54.788 --> 06:55.986
What is your name?

06:55.988 --> 06:57.892
Jonathan Landay.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.930
Goodbye, Jonathan Landay.

07:08.067 --> 07:11.101
Exercise complete.

07:11.103 --> 07:14.272
What you have just engaged in is
called The Gray Man Exercise.

07:14.274 --> 07:16.308
And what you have just
witnessed...

07:16.310 --> 07:20.044
is a colossal failure
of that exercise.

07:20.046 --> 07:21.645
If a journalist is captured...

07:21.647 --> 07:23.582
terrorists may keep you alive...

07:23.584 --> 07:27.284
in hopes of getting information
or exchanging you for a ransom.

07:27.286 --> 07:30.854
But if you give them a reason
to kill you, they will.

07:30.856 --> 07:33.291
The purpose of this exercise
is to teach you...

07:33.293 --> 07:35.993
how to avoid drawing the
attention of your captors.

07:35.995 --> 07:37.294
Hence the name, Gray Man.

07:37.296 --> 07:38.964
Can you untie me?

07:38.966 --> 07:40.965
This could save your life one
day, you understand?

07:40.967 --> 07:43.668
I do, I've been in 11 war zones,
I've been shot at...

07:43.670 --> 07:46.637
I've been held captive, I take
this very seriously.

07:46.639 --> 07:50.808
But if you don't untie me right
now, I may lose my job.

07:50.810 --> 07:53.044
And I'm fairly certain that
none of this training...

07:53.046 --> 07:54.678
is going to be very useful...

07:54.680 --> 07:56.651
when I'm mopping the floor
at Staples.

08:05.091 --> 08:07.058
<i>Both of the twin towers...</i>

08:07.060 --> 08:09.760
<i>the World Trade Center in New
York's lower Manhattan...</i>

08:09.762 --> 08:13.164
<i>have been struck by planes this
morning within 20 minutes.</i>

08:13.166 --> 08:15.200
<i>First, it was the North Tower
that was struck...</i>

08:15.202 --> 08:17.736
<i>with a gaping hole left in two
sides of that building.</i>

08:17.738 --> 08:19.137
Good God.

08:19.139 --> 08:21.171
<i>20 minutes later, the second
building...</i>

08:21.173 --> 08:24.075
<i>the second tower in that World
Trade Center complex...</i>

08:24.077 --> 08:25.976
I think we should keep Elizabeth
in school.

08:25.978 --> 08:27.277
Yeah, no, I think that's
a good idea.

08:27.279 --> 08:29.214
Why freak her out, huh?

08:29.216 --> 08:32.417
And I'll call Ali and Jennifer
as soon as the phones open up.

08:32.419 --> 08:33.751
- I love you.
- I love you.

08:33.753 --> 08:35.086
Okay.

08:35.087 --> 08:36.721
<i>We should tell you that...</i>

08:36.722 --> 08:38.423
<i>we have gotten calls from
people...</i>

08:38.424 --> 08:40.692
<i>who live and work around the
Pentagon who have told us...</i>

08:40.693 --> 08:42.159
<i>that they have seen
something...</i>

08:42.160 --> 08:44.162
<i>that they have described
as an explosion.</i>

08:44.164 --> 08:47.101
<i>This is information we have not
been able to confirm.</i>

09:23.203 --> 09:24.372
Get up.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.207
Sorry, Dad.

09:29.209 --> 09:31.775
Monday Night Football went long.

09:31.777 --> 09:33.813
Let's clean this place up.

09:41.121 --> 09:42.453
<i>Trade Center
here in New York...</i>

09:42.455 --> 09:44.322
<i>have been hit by airplanes.</i>

09:44.324 --> 09:47.491
<i>In Washington, there is a large
fire at the Pentagon.</i>

09:47.493 --> 09:49.360
<i>The Pentagon has been
evacuated.</i>

09:49.362 --> 09:52.496
<i>And there is, you can see,
perhaps, the second tower...</i>

09:52.498 --> 09:56.266
<i>the front tower, the top
portion of which is collapsing.</i>

09:56.268 --> 09:58.502
<i>Good Lord.</i>

09:58.504 --> 10:03.441
Lot of people going to need
a drink tonight.

10:03.443 --> 10:05.746
Soldiers drink free.

10:08.515 --> 10:11.448
<i>There are no words.</i>

10:11.450 --> 10:15.819
<i>All federal office buildings
now...</i>

10:15.821 --> 10:18.490
<i>all federal office buildings
in Washington, D.C.</i>

10:18.492 --> 10:21.860
<i>are being evacuated as we speak
to you now.</i>

10:21.862 --> 10:24.895
<i>We are in the middle of an
extraordinary catastrophe.</i>

10:24.897 --> 10:27.932
<i>The most important things to
tell you if you just joined...</i>

10:27.934 --> 10:31.034
<i>in is that what has all the
makings of an extraordinarily..</i>

10:31.036 --> 10:34.505
<i>well-planned terrorist attack
on both Washington and New York</i>

10:34.507 --> 10:35.973
<i>has taken place this morning.</i>

10:35.975 --> 10:38.108
<i>The Trade Centers here
in New York...</i>

10:38.110 --> 10:40.410
<i>the two World Trade Center
towers have collapsed...</i>

10:40.412 --> 10:43.717
<i>after being hit by planes.</i>

10:46.953 --> 10:50.053
Yeah, this is John Walcott
from Knight Ridder.

10:50.055 --> 10:51.789
Is he there?

10:51.791 --> 10:55.860
Yeah, okay, well, tell him
I'll try him back later.

10:55.862 --> 10:57.294
Thank you.

10:57.296 --> 10:59.130
I just spoke with my wife.

10:59.132 --> 11:01.432
She and the kids are
afraid to leave the house.

11:01.434 --> 11:04.101
What are they doing over there?

11:04.103 --> 11:05.370
They're watching the White
House.

11:05.372 --> 11:06.971
To see if it gets hit?

11:06.973 --> 11:08.338
Yes.

11:08.340 --> 11:10.975
Oh, Jesus. All right, go home
to your family.

11:10.977 --> 11:14.111
And tell your colleagues that
maybe they want to stay away...

11:14.113 --> 11:15.446
from the windows, okay?

11:15.448 --> 11:17.515
- Thanks, John.
- Yeah.

11:17.517 --> 11:19.520
Okay. All right. Okay.

11:22.421 --> 11:25.823
<i>Their working thesis is that
this is overseas terrorism...</i>

11:25.825 --> 11:27.292
<i>not domestic.</i>

11:27.294 --> 11:29.494
<i>Attention will quickly turn to
the bin Laden group...</i>

11:29.496 --> 11:31.295
<i>because it has long
tentacles.</i>

11:31.297 --> 11:34.064
<i>There are very few others that
could have pulled this off.</i>

11:34.066 --> 11:35.833
Are we sending somebody
to New York?

11:35.835 --> 11:38.468
Ken Moore at Suvu was already up
there covering Wall Street.

11:38.470 --> 11:39.971
What's going on over at State?

11:39.973 --> 11:41.840
Powell's in Peru.

11:41.842 --> 11:43.441
They're working on getting
him home as soon as possible.

11:43.443 --> 11:46.311
All right, what we need to do
is track the President.

11:46.313 --> 11:48.612
Track his top people
and find out...

11:48.614 --> 11:50.848
who's responsible for all this.

11:50.850 --> 11:53.550
We need as many sources
at as many agencies...

11:53.552 --> 11:56.855
to go on the record and tell us
all what we know has to be true.

11:56.857 --> 12:00.357
Al Qaeda! Al Qaeda!
It's Al Qaeda.

12:00.359 --> 12:01.895
It's definitely Al Qaeda.

12:03.262 --> 12:05.429
What the hell are you wearing?

12:05.431 --> 12:07.631
Well, the wifey wanted
to evacuate...

12:07.633 --> 12:11.369
but she locked the cat
and the keys in the cars.

12:11.371 --> 12:13.938
So, I biked in.

12:13.940 --> 12:17.909
We need to know how
they pulled this off.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.977
Anybody needs to go home
to their family...

12:19.979 --> 12:21.913
feel free to do so.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.182
Just came from the family.

12:24.184 --> 12:26.887
Let's get to work.

12:28.121 --> 12:29.654
It's Walcott.

12:29.656 --> 12:32.356
<i>Today, our fellow citizens,
our way of life...</i>

12:32.358 --> 12:37.127
<i>our very freedom, came under
attack in a series...</i>

12:37.129 --> 12:40.198
<i>of deliberate and deadly
terrorist acts.</i>

12:40.200 --> 12:41.632
Adam, hand me the
Jameson, please.

12:41.634 --> 12:43.934
Yes, sir. Here you go.

12:43.936 --> 12:45.238
Thank you, son.

12:46.973 --> 12:48.305
It's on the house, gentlemen.

12:48.307 --> 12:50.042
Thanks.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.577
Dad's saying we're staying open
as late as they want.

12:52.579 --> 12:55.145
They must be scared.

12:55.147 --> 12:58.348
- They're Rangers.
- They're boys.

12:58.350 --> 13:02.153
<i>Our military is powerful and
it's prepared.</i>

13:02.155 --> 13:03.621
<i>The search is underway
for those...</i>

13:03.623 --> 13:05.555
<i>who are behind these evil acts.</i>

13:05.557 --> 13:08.293
<i>I've directed the full
resources of our intelligence..</i>

13:08.295 --> 13:11.496
<i>and law enforcement communities
to find those responsible...</i>

13:11.498 --> 13:14.368
<i>and to bring them to justice.</i>

13:18.338 --> 13:21.005
<i>It's been 33 hours
since the terrible...</i>

13:21.007 --> 13:23.408
<i>and unprecedented attack
on the United States.</i>

13:23.410 --> 13:26.443
<i>There is, as we've said, an
enormous search and rescue...</i>

13:26.445 --> 13:31.149
<i>operation, and enormous and
intense criminal investigation.</i>

13:31.151 --> 13:32.616
<i>And we're just beginning
to understand...</i>

13:32.618 --> 13:35.285
<i>the extents of the catastrophe.</i>

13:35.287 --> 13:37.188
I feel like I haven't
slept in a month.

13:37.190 --> 13:39.122
It's going to be a bunch
of zombies running this town.

13:39.124 --> 13:40.591
What do you know about
the preliminary plans...

13:40.593 --> 13:42.260
to go after bin Laden?

13:42.262 --> 13:44.194
I don't have anything to give
you on that yet.

13:44.196 --> 13:46.264
Ok, well, how long before we're
on the ground in Afghanistan...

13:46.266 --> 13:48.131
and how long do they project
we'll be there?

13:48.133 --> 13:51.635
Look, I'm trying to get answers
to the same questions you are.

13:51.637 --> 13:54.739
What I can say is, most of the
talk this morning...

13:54.741 --> 13:57.308
hasn't been about Afghanistan.

13:57.310 --> 13:59.113
Well, what's it been about?

14:00.747 --> 14:02.447
Iraq?

14:02.449 --> 14:04.481
I got it from a source at State
who got it from the Pentagon.

14:04.483 --> 14:07.150
In connection with the attacks?

14:07.152 --> 14:09.287
Crackpot theories from people
who don't know...

14:09.289 --> 14:10.587
what the hell they're talking
about.

14:10.589 --> 14:12.189
It was Rumsfeld.

14:12.191 --> 14:13.757
Really?

14:13.759 --> 14:16.193
Yeah, apparently, there's a lot
of people over at Defense...

14:16.195 --> 14:18.496
that think this had to be
State-sponsored.

14:18.498 --> 14:22.100
I mean, not just Rumsfeld,
there's also that smug...

14:22.102 --> 14:25.202
son of a bitch at the Defense
Policy Board...

14:25.204 --> 14:26.603
the Prince of Darkness?

14:26.605 --> 14:28.539
- Richard Perle.
- Right. Perle.

14:28.541 --> 14:30.774
And that neo-con over at the
Project...

14:30.776 --> 14:33.311
for the New American
whatever the fuck...

14:33.313 --> 14:34.645
New American Century,
Bill Kristol.

14:34.647 --> 14:36.481
That giant butthole,
Bill Kristol.

14:36.483 --> 14:40.351
And he's got to be creaming his
little jammies over this.

14:40.353 --> 14:42.186
Yeah, these think-tank boys...

14:42.188 --> 14:44.322
have been trying to push out
Saddam Hussein since '97.

14:44.324 --> 14:48.292
They have this crazy theory that
if they can just stick...

14:48.294 --> 14:50.361
a Western-style of democracy in
the Middle East...

14:50.363 --> 14:52.730
it's going to magically
proliferate...

14:52.732 --> 14:54.399
and wind up protecting Israel.

14:54.401 --> 14:56.768
You got to give them credit
for creative thinking.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.236
It's Ivory Tower crap.

14:59.238 --> 15:02.140
I mean, in what world do they
think that Osama bin Laden...

15:02.142 --> 15:04.775
and Saddam Hussein hatched
this thing up together?

15:04.777 --> 15:06.811
Let's find out if these
dickweeds...

15:06.813 --> 15:09.813
are serious about Iraq, okay?

15:09.815 --> 15:11.616
Look, I'm not saying there's
a link to Iraq...

15:11.618 --> 15:13.183
and neither is my boss.

15:13.185 --> 15:14.452
This is just something
we're hearing.

15:14.454 --> 15:15.752
From whom?

15:15.754 --> 15:18.121
Who told me or where is it
coming from?

15:18.123 --> 15:19.557
Take your pick.

15:19.559 --> 15:21.092
Someone at the Pentagon.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.093
In the Vice President's office?

15:23.095 --> 15:24.428
It's just theories.

15:24.430 --> 15:26.430
Are there any Senators talking
to anyone...

15:26.432 --> 15:28.632
saying anything different?

15:28.634 --> 15:30.268
I know Powell's objected...

15:30.270 --> 15:33.737
to going into anywhere other
than Afghanistan.

16:05.338 --> 16:06.404
Go away.

16:06.406 --> 16:07.737
One question and I'm gone.

16:07.739 --> 16:09.473
I'm not talking to you
on the record.

16:09.475 --> 16:13.046
Anonymous source, intelligence
community.

16:14.214 --> 16:15.712
You can't use my name.

16:15.714 --> 16:18.149
Never have, never will.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.116
Or my agency.

16:19.118 --> 16:21.055
Pinky swear.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.890
One question.

16:25.892 --> 16:28.796
Are you looking into an Iraqi
connection?

16:30.796 --> 16:33.530
Who's the you in that question?

16:33.532 --> 16:35.298
Are we in the United States?

16:35.300 --> 16:36.833
There are some people.

16:36.835 --> 16:38.468
Are we in my agency?

16:38.470 --> 16:40.371
Not that I'm aware of.

16:40.373 --> 16:42.874
Am I, personally?

16:42.876 --> 16:45.342
No way.

16:45.344 --> 16:47.377
Okay, the second part
to the question.

16:47.379 --> 16:48.513
No.

16:48.515 --> 16:50.184
Thank you.

16:52.484 --> 16:54.751
So, no one you work with at the
Library of Congress has ever...

16:54.753 --> 16:56.821
found a link between Saddam
Hussein and Al Qaeda?

16:56.823 --> 16:59.524
No one I work with
would expect to find a link.

16:59.526 --> 17:01.324
So, as far as you know...

17:01.326 --> 17:02.793
there's nothing substantial to
tie Iraq to bin Laden?

17:02.795 --> 17:04.461
There's nothing even
circumstantial.

17:04.463 --> 17:06.496
To lump together a secular
leader like Saddam...

17:06.498 --> 17:09.499
with an Islamic extremist
like bin Laden is simply...

17:09.501 --> 17:11.637
to have no understanding
of the Muslim world.

17:15.941 --> 17:17.874
It's a bit timid.

17:17.876 --> 17:19.944
No one's actually come out and
said anything publicly yet.

17:19.945 --> 17:21.945
Maybe it's just backroom
speculation.

17:21.948 --> 17:23.480
Pretty dangerous speculation.

17:23.482 --> 17:25.483
Can't we hit it harder than
this?

17:25.484 --> 17:27.417
The attacks were just 10 days
ago.

17:27.420 --> 17:28.553
Everyone's trying to play
catch-up.

17:28.555 --> 17:30.487
Got to press our reliables.

17:30.489 --> 17:32.489
I'll reach out to The Italian
Lady.

17:32.491 --> 17:34.492
You think you can get Loose
Nukes to go on the record?

17:34.494 --> 17:36.761
I'm lucky to get her on deep
background.

17:36.763 --> 17:40.497
Well, double down on the Charm
Offensive.

17:40.499 --> 17:43.266
<i>Buongiorno,</i> this is Warren
Strobel.

17:43.268 --> 17:46.536
I was looking to get your advice
on a critical scheduling matter.

17:46.538 --> 17:49.607
If you could contact me at your
earliest possible convenience...

17:49.609 --> 17:52.576
I would greatly appreciate it.
Thank you.

17:52.578 --> 17:53.710
<i>Hello.</i>

17:53.712 --> 17:55.513
Yeah, hi, it's Jonathan.

17:55.515 --> 17:56.980
<i>I don't have
anything for you.</i>

17:56.982 --> 18:00.418
No, I know, I know, but I'm
doing a story...

18:00.420 --> 18:02.786
on the administration's seeming
interest in Iraq.

18:02.788 --> 18:04.788
<i>Jonathan, we're
not going to talk about this.</i>

18:04.790 --> 18:07.691
No, I know, I know I'm not
talking about this...

18:07.693 --> 18:10.995
because it's off the record, but
can you give me some indication?

18:10.997 --> 18:12.365
<i>Bye, Jonathan.</i>

18:14.366 --> 18:15.699
What'd she say?

18:15.701 --> 18:18.236
She sends her love.

18:18.238 --> 18:19.637
<i>Across the nation...</i>

18:19.639 --> 18:21.572
<i>flags have been flying off
the shelves.</i>

18:21.574 --> 18:25.476
<i>A wave of patriotism has been
spreading across America.</i>

18:25.478 --> 18:29.280
<i>At times like this,
it's what we do in America.</i>

18:29.282 --> 18:32.682
<i>We the People pull together.</i>

18:32.684 --> 18:34.685
They had a discussion in school
today...

18:34.687 --> 18:37.420
about why America is so great,
right?

18:37.422 --> 18:38.889
Yeah, and what'd you say?

18:38.891 --> 18:40.490
It's a free country.

18:40.492 --> 18:41.926
That's a great answer.

18:41.928 --> 18:43.526
That's Mama's boy.

18:43.528 --> 18:45.295
May I be done now?

18:45.297 --> 18:47.297
Not until I get a big hug.

18:47.299 --> 18:50.400
Okay, after your mom gets a hug.

18:50.402 --> 18:51.971
Oh, whoa!

18:54.673 --> 18:56.306
Proud of you, munchie.

18:56.308 --> 18:58.211
Love you.

19:00.446 --> 19:04.047
They're really pushing this
nationalism thing at school.

19:04.049 --> 19:05.815
What do you expect?

19:05.817 --> 19:07.618
Of course, there's
going to be patriotism now.

19:07.620 --> 19:11.421
Oh, you want to call it
patriotism?

19:11.423 --> 19:12.922
Fine.

19:12.924 --> 19:14.691
It smells a lot like
nationalism to me.

19:14.693 --> 19:19.663
That's how it started in
Yugoslavia before the war.

19:19.665 --> 19:21.634
Tore my country apart.

19:44.957 --> 19:47.891
You want some help?

19:47.893 --> 19:50.529
No, I'm okay, thank you.

19:52.664 --> 19:54.631
Okay, have a good night.

19:54.633 --> 19:55.635
Good night.

20:03.543 --> 20:05.909
How real is the Iraqi
conversation?

20:05.911 --> 20:07.911
There's an argument
taking place.

20:07.913 --> 20:10.848
Yeah? Who's winning it?

20:10.850 --> 20:12.615
I couldn't say.

20:12.617 --> 20:16.853
Look, my boss is gonna send me
to Afghanistan, and all I want..

20:16.855 --> 20:20.390
to know is should he be buying
a roundtrip ticket...

20:20.392 --> 20:24.597
or is Afghanistan just a
layover on the way to Baghdad?

20:28.700 --> 20:31.468
I can't tell you anything.

20:31.470 --> 20:33.504
<i>I believe major acts
of terrorism...</i>

20:33.506 --> 20:36.607
<i>against the U.S. are
state-sponsored.</i>

20:36.609 --> 20:39.810
<i>So, we asked ourselves,
"Who could have been behind...</i>

20:39.812 --> 20:42.746
<i>the most massive terrorist
assault in human history...</i>

20:42.748 --> 20:44.648
<i>"which state?"</i>

20:44.650 --> 20:49.853
<i>I think Iraq is the state that
most immediately comes to mind.</i>

20:49.855 --> 20:52.656
<i>This is an idea which in...</i>

20:52.658 --> 20:54.725
<i>is gaining increased
credibility.</i>

20:54.727 --> 20:56.627
Knight Ridder, it's Strobel.

20:56.629 --> 20:58.094
<i>Jim Woolsey
is going to Europe...</i>

20:58.096 --> 20:59.830
<i>to try to find a link
between Saddam...</i>

20:59.832 --> 21:02.602
<i>and the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing.</i>

21:03.769 --> 21:05.636
Is he freelancing?

21:05.638 --> 21:07.772
<i>He was sent
on an official government jet.</i>

21:07.774 --> 21:10.006
Jesus, who sent him?

21:10.008 --> 21:12.709
<i>The deputy defense secretary.</i>

21:12.711 --> 21:14.911
Can you meet for coffee?

21:14.913 --> 21:16.450
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

21:17.883 --> 21:19.883
Hi, this is Warren
Strobel with Knight Ridder.

21:19.885 --> 21:21.619
I'm working on a story...

21:21.621 --> 21:23.187
about former CIA director James
Woolsey traveling to Europe.

21:23.189 --> 21:25.188
Do you know anything about that?

21:25.190 --> 21:28.191
<i>I didn't have
anything to do with that.</i>

21:28.193 --> 21:30.194
But you're aware that such
a trip has taken place?

21:30.196 --> 21:33.730
<i>I can't be your only
source on this.</i>

21:33.732 --> 21:35.901
All right, stay in touch.

21:37.702 --> 21:40.470
Hey, John.

21:40.472 --> 21:42.605
Woolsey was sent to Europe
to look for evidence...

21:42.607 --> 21:45.543
linking Saddam to the World
Trade Center bombing in '93.

21:45.545 --> 21:48.711
Wouldn't be a fool's errand if
they didn't send a fool.

21:48.713 --> 21:50.547
This came from The Italian Lady?

21:50.549 --> 21:51.748
And a diplomat who can
confirm...

21:51.750 --> 21:53.082
the trip was arranged by
Wolfowitz.

21:53.084 --> 21:54.752
What the hell is going on
over at Defense?

21:54.754 --> 21:56.786
Question is, are they trying to
figure out...

21:56.788 --> 21:58.555
if there's any truth to their
theory...

21:58.557 --> 22:01.191
or are they already convinced
their theory is true?

22:01.193 --> 22:02.927
You're sure about
this Woolsey trip?

22:02.929 --> 22:04.928
- Positive.
- You have a third source?

22:04.930 --> 22:06.030
- Yeah.
- Who?

22:06.032 --> 22:07.834
Jim Woolsey.

22:20.112 --> 22:23.917
Hey, it's Walcott,
you up for a field trip?

22:26.786 --> 22:28.752
I figured you'd be calling...

22:28.754 --> 22:30.557
I just didn't think
it would be this soon.

22:33.659 --> 22:35.758
How real is the chatter
about Iraq?

22:35.760 --> 22:37.628
Very.

22:37.630 --> 22:41.532
And it's diverting our attention
from the people who attacked us.

22:41.534 --> 22:44.171
How soon before Iraq becomes
the focus?

22:45.904 --> 22:48.639
We need to blow something up.

22:48.641 --> 22:50.674
Not enough targets in
Afghanistan.

22:50.676 --> 22:51.809
What about bin Laden?

22:51.811 --> 22:53.276
You take out bin Laden...

22:53.278 --> 22:55.714
interest in the war goes right
down the shitter.

22:57.650 --> 23:00.851
<i>A joint offensive in
its sixth day in Tora Bora...</i>

23:00.853 --> 23:02.820
<i>bin Laden's suspected
hideout...</i>

23:02.822 --> 23:05.589
<i>but still no signs of the
world's most wanted man.</i>

23:05.591 --> 23:09.159
<i>U.S. B-52s pounding Al Qaeda
positions from the air...</i>

23:09.161 --> 23:10.894
<i>while anti-Taliban tanks...</i>

23:10.896 --> 23:12.696
<i>and troops meet strong
resistance...</i>

23:12.698 --> 23:15.131
<i>cave to cave,
from Al Qaeda fighters.</i>

23:15.133 --> 23:17.001
<i>With yet more conflicting
reports...</i>

23:17.003 --> 23:19.005
<i>on bin Laden's whereabouts.</i>

23:20.940 --> 23:22.672
What you got there...

23:22.674 --> 23:24.675
is that your State of the
Union piece for tomorrow?

23:24.677 --> 23:26.709
- Yup.
- You got a lunch today?

23:26.711 --> 23:28.879
Not with you.

23:28.881 --> 23:30.980
I got a one-on-one with Looney
Tunes over at State.

23:30.982 --> 23:32.582
There's a dry hole.

23:32.584 --> 23:34.284
Yeah, well, I figured if I just
let him ramble on...

23:34.286 --> 23:36.320
he'll accidentally stumble
into something newsworthy.

23:36.322 --> 23:37.755
Yeah, well, give my best.

23:37.757 --> 23:39.790
I will. Hot off the presses,
Beryl.

23:39.792 --> 23:41.225
Did you use punctuation
this time?

23:41.227 --> 23:43.159
I even threw in a few semicolons
just for you.

23:43.161 --> 23:46.764
I bet you're the pride of the
University of Missouri.

23:46.766 --> 23:50.801
<i>Terrorists who once occupied
Afghanistan...</i>

23:50.803 --> 23:53.672
<i>now occupy cells
at Guantanamo Bay.</i>

23:56.909 --> 23:59.976
<i>And terrorist leaders who urged
followers to sacrifice...</i>

23:59.978 --> 24:03.280
<i>their lives are running'
for their own.</i>

24:03.282 --> 24:07.851
Now, the administration's top
priority apart from our own...

24:07.853 --> 24:11.788
security is to ensure
freedom for other countries...

24:11.790 --> 24:16.060
looking to embrace democracy
as a way of life.

24:16.062 --> 24:18.861
Now, we... excuse me... we
understand that we can't...

24:18.863 --> 24:20.863
be the policemen to the world...

24:20.865 --> 24:23.266
but we feel we
have a responsibility to...

24:23.268 --> 24:24.668
Yeah, John Walcott.

24:24.670 --> 24:26.102
<i>John!</i>

24:26.104 --> 24:27.236
Dixie?

24:27.238 --> 24:28.706
<i>John, can you hear me?</i>

24:28.708 --> 24:30.239
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

24:30.241 --> 24:32.610
I got a call from one of
our boys downrange today...

24:32.612 --> 24:34.178
asking me what the fuck's
going on.

24:34.180 --> 24:35.979
Are you still in Afghanistan?

24:35.981 --> 24:37.614
Yeah, I'm in Afghanistan...

24:37.616 --> 24:39.115
but nobody knows what the
mission is anymore.

24:39.117 --> 24:41.051
How do you bomb a country back
into the Stone Age...

24:41.053 --> 24:43.219
that's already in the middle
of the goddamn Stone Age?

24:43.221 --> 24:46.357
<i>Our second goal is to prevent
regimes that sponsor terror...</i>

24:46.359 --> 24:50.727
<i>from threatening America,
or our friends and allies...</i>

24:50.729 --> 24:52.630
<i>with weapons of mass
destruction.</i>

24:52.632 --> 24:56.667
We believe that Afghanistan
is ripe for freedom.

24:56.669 --> 25:00.070
Now, this is a country that has
been struggling to free...

25:00.072 --> 25:03.273
<i>itself from the repressive grip
of the Taliban for years.</i>

25:03.275 --> 25:06.643
We've got bin Laden on the run
and they're diverting my assets.

25:06.645 --> 25:08.411
We may never get him in our
crosshairs again.

25:08.413 --> 25:11.982
Whoa, whoa, wait, they're
diverting your assets to where?

25:11.984 --> 25:14.284
<i>Some of these regimes have been
pretty quiet since...</i>

25:14.286 --> 25:18.121
<i>September the 11th, but we know
their true nature.</i>

25:18.123 --> 25:21.958
You know, it's a country in
desperate need of the kind...

25:21.960 --> 25:24.961
of stability that comes with the
rule of law.

25:24.963 --> 25:28.966
<i>North Korea, Iran, Iraq...
states like these...</i>

25:28.968 --> 25:33.871
<i>and their terrorist allies
constitute an axis of evil...</i>

25:33.873 --> 25:35.938
<i>arming to threaten the
peace of the world.</i>

25:35.940 --> 25:37.675
You'll have to excuse me...

25:37.677 --> 25:40.244
Warren, but I have to prepare
a briefing for Secretary Powell.

25:40.246 --> 25:41.245
Sure.

25:41.247 --> 25:42.412
Anything else you need from me?

25:42.414 --> 25:44.180
No, no, thank you.

25:44.182 --> 25:45.983
I think you've given me
more than enough to chew on.

25:45.985 --> 25:47.316
Excellent.

25:47.318 --> 25:48.951
And you feel confident that
Afghanistan...

25:48.953 --> 25:50.286
will accept a Western-style
democracy?

25:50.288 --> 25:51.788
Oh, absolutely.

25:51.790 --> 25:54.291
Just as confident as
we are about Iraq.

25:54.293 --> 25:58.062
Sounds like the debate on Iraq
is getting serious.

25:58.064 --> 26:00.863
Oh, no, no, no, that debate
is over.

26:00.865 --> 26:04.200
Saddam's got to go,
the only question is how.

26:04.202 --> 26:05.369
Good talking to you, Warren.

26:05.371 --> 26:07.273
Yeah, you, too, sir.

26:09.441 --> 26:11.207
The president
is going to invade Iraq.

26:11.209 --> 26:12.942
<i>You got this from Looney Tunes?</i>

26:12.944 --> 26:15.044
Yeah, and confirmed by a
diplomat who says he met...

26:15.046 --> 26:18.148
with Bush, and a foreign leader
recently who came away with...

26:18.150 --> 26:21.485
"The feeling that a decision has
been made to strike Iraq."

26:21.487 --> 26:23.786
Do you think we can get enough
to run the story?

26:23.788 --> 26:25.924
Unfortunately, I do.

26:38.804 --> 26:40.403
So much for the ceasefire.

26:40.405 --> 26:42.206
Yeah, well, really nice of us...

26:42.208 --> 26:44.844
to temporarily stop shooting
at them, though.

27:07.767 --> 27:11.001
You know, I tried to chat
with your translator today.

27:11.003 --> 27:12.535
Yeah, how'd that go?

27:12.537 --> 27:15.272
Well, for a guy who gets paid
to talk for a living...

27:15.274 --> 27:17.975
he was unusually quiet.

27:17.977 --> 27:20.310
He only talks to me.

27:20.312 --> 27:24.413
Really? And what'd he tell you?

27:24.415 --> 27:27.383
Dollar, I'll let you read
all about it.

27:27.385 --> 27:31.455
Let me see it.

27:31.457 --> 27:35.559
bin Laden's gone, isn't he?

27:35.561 --> 27:39.095
They missed him, didn't they?

27:39.097 --> 27:43.368
He was here and they fucking
missed him!

27:45.403 --> 27:47.236
<i>A senior U.S.

Oh, it's official...

28:03.255 --> 28:06.089
this is the saddest event
I've ever attended.

28:06.091 --> 28:08.057
I'm going back to my apartment,
drink a bottle of wine...

28:08.059 --> 28:09.325
and put my head in the oven.

28:09.327 --> 28:11.128
Okay, but before you do that...

28:11.130 --> 28:14.096
I really want you to meet the
guy I was telling you about.

28:14.098 --> 28:16.065
Oh! He just walked in!

28:16.067 --> 28:18.067
Forget the wine, I'll kill
myself now.

28:18.069 --> 28:22.371
No, not him... him.
I'll introduce you.

28:22.373 --> 28:23.506
Pam, please don't.

28:23.508 --> 28:26.409
- Warren! Hey!
- Oh, hi.

28:26.411 --> 28:28.211
Glad you could make it,
come on over.

28:28.213 --> 28:31.582
Warren, this is a
good friend of mine, Lisa Mayr.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.449
Lisa, this is Warren Strobel,
he's a journalist...

28:33.451 --> 28:35.121
and I'm gonna get another drink.

28:37.355 --> 28:39.022
Hi, uh, Lisa?

28:39.024 --> 28:40.457
- Yeah.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

28:40.459 --> 28:42.128
- Hi.
- Uh...

28:43.461 --> 28:46.463
Did you ever make it
into your apartment?

28:46.465 --> 28:50.967
Uh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, no, no, I'm sorry.

28:50.969 --> 28:54.406
- Yeah, I made it in okay.
- Good. Good.

28:56.141 --> 28:58.274
So, you're a journalist?

28:58.276 --> 29:01.143
Yeah, yeah, for Knight Ridder.

29:01.145 --> 29:03.947
Oh, is that a magazine
or a newspaper?

29:03.949 --> 29:09.052
It's actually a consortium
of 31 newspapers, actually.

29:09.054 --> 29:10.586
Well, my stories go out to all
of our newspapers...

29:10.588 --> 29:14.091
and each one has the option
to publish or not.

29:14.093 --> 29:17.127
Oh, okay. I've always wondered
how that worked.

29:17.129 --> 29:18.430
Yeah.

29:21.600 --> 29:25.669
Hey, I got married when
I was 22.

29:25.671 --> 29:29.339
And we're only recently
separated, so...

29:29.341 --> 29:31.941
This is a little awkward for me.

29:31.943 --> 29:33.310
It's okay.

29:33.312 --> 29:35.245
I'm a little out of practice.

29:35.247 --> 29:39.082
Why don't you start
by asking me a question?

29:39.084 --> 29:41.854
Sure, yeah.

29:43.655 --> 29:45.924
Are you a Republican
or a Democrat?

29:47.426 --> 29:49.258
Try again.

29:49.260 --> 29:52.295
Yeah, of course, she wants you
to call her.

29:52.297 --> 29:54.031
She gave you her card.

29:54.033 --> 29:56.166
No, maybe she's just trying
to gin up business.

29:56.168 --> 29:58.669
At a singles mixer
on Valentine's Day?

29:58.671 --> 30:00.938
What? So, call her? I should
call her?

30:00.940 --> 30:02.973
What? No, no, no,
actually, let her dangle.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.941
There's nothing a woman in her
30s likes more...

30:04.943 --> 30:07.177
than a guy who takes his time.

30:07.179 --> 30:09.012
I'm fine, Arthur, I'm fine.

30:09.014 --> 30:11.480
It's just that I'm getting a
little tired...

30:11.482 --> 30:13.417
of picking up your paper
every morning...

30:13.419 --> 30:15.384
and seeing that you're not
running our stories.

30:15.386 --> 30:17.219
I mean, last time I looked...

30:17.221 --> 30:21.057
The Philadelphia Inquirer was
a Knight Ridder paper, right?

30:21.059 --> 30:24.961
The point is, there's no point
in being a Knight Ridder paper..

30:24.963 --> 30:26.697
if you're not going to run
Knight Ridder stories.

30:26.699 --> 30:28.732
John, we've been through
this already.

30:28.734 --> 30:30.434
Your stories don't fit...

30:30.436 --> 30:33.269
in with what we're doing
over here right now.

30:33.271 --> 30:35.371
Don't fit? Don't fit with what?
The truth?

30:35.373 --> 30:37.274
<i>What's the matter, Arthur...</i>

30:37.276 --> 30:39.008
the truth doesn't sell
papers anymore?

30:39.010 --> 30:40.476
<i>And today, for the
first time...</i>

30:40.478 --> 30:42.278
<i>the administration provided...</i>

30:42.280 --> 30:45.381
<i>details for what it has always
insisted was a connection...</i>

30:45.383 --> 30:48.150
<i>between Saddam Hussein
and Al Qaeda.</i>

30:48.152 --> 30:49.719
<i>How strong is that case?</i>

30:49.721 --> 30:52.022
<i>Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein says...</i>

30:52.024 --> 30:54.992
<i>he does not have any illegal
weapons of mass destruction...</i>

30:54.994 --> 30:58.195
<i>and accused the United States
of using weapons...</i>

30:58.197 --> 31:00.730
<i>as a pretext to start a war.</i>

31:00.732 --> 31:05.034
Mr. Galloway, how closely did
the movie conform to your book?

31:05.036 --> 31:08.438
The movie was about 80% accurate
and 20% bullshit...

31:08.440 --> 31:12.411
which I guess by Hollywood
standards is an accomplishment.

31:14.013 --> 31:16.679
What inspired you to write
the book?

31:16.681 --> 31:19.082
Being shot at by the North
Vietnamese army.

31:19.084 --> 31:21.284
What was the biggest difference
between experiencing...

31:21.286 --> 31:25.589
the Battle of Ia Drang in person
versus watching it in a theater?

31:25.591 --> 31:27.493
The popcorn in Ia Drang was
saltier.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.427
Last question.

31:30.429 --> 31:32.528
Can you draw any comparisons
between Vietnam...

31:32.530 --> 31:35.131
and what's happening today
in Afghanistan?

31:35.133 --> 31:38.267
It's very different, but I think
it is appropriate...

31:38.269 --> 31:42.272
that before we start dropping
bombs, we think long and hard...

31:42.274 --> 31:45.042
about the greatest lesson
we got from Vietnam.

31:45.044 --> 31:46.676
Which is?

31:46.678 --> 31:51.247
When the government fucks up,
the soldiers pay the price.

31:51.249 --> 31:54.316
To what do I owe this
unexpected visit?

31:54.318 --> 31:56.652
Well, I was hoping I'd get
an autograph...

31:56.654 --> 31:59.255
from the world's most famous
war correspondent.

31:59.257 --> 32:03.259
I hate this part. Reporters are
not supposed to be the story.

32:03.261 --> 32:06.463
Reporters are not supposed to be
awarded the Bronze Star, either.

32:06.465 --> 32:08.832
How do you like the job
at State?

32:08.834 --> 32:10.467
I love working for General
Powell...

32:10.469 --> 32:12.134
and I hate working
for Uncle Sam.

32:12.136 --> 32:13.637
You miss reporting?

32:13.639 --> 32:15.471
After 42 years, I thought...

32:15.473 --> 32:17.274
I should take some time
away from it.

32:17.276 --> 32:20.744
So, I went to work at the State
Department on September 10th...

32:20.746 --> 32:23.112
and the next day the biggest
story of my life broke.

32:23.114 --> 32:25.782
I'd say there's a little bit
of a tug.

32:25.784 --> 32:29.518
We're working on something
important, that's why I'm here.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.588
To make me envious?

32:31.590 --> 32:34.424
To make you an offer.

32:34.426 --> 32:37.726
<i>If he gets weapons
of mass destruction, Jerry.</i>

32:37.728 --> 32:39.795
<i>What does that mean
for the world?</i>

32:39.797 --> 32:41.531
<i>What does that mean
for the Middle East?</i>

32:41.533 --> 32:43.499
- Can you turn it down?
- I'm trying to watch the news.

32:43.501 --> 32:45.768
Stop calling it that.

32:45.770 --> 32:47.272
Hey, son.

32:52.311 --> 32:54.844
Adam, what's the matter?

32:54.846 --> 32:57.416
I met with a recruiter.

33:02.121 --> 33:04.390
<i>A lot of people
are gonna die, Jerry.</i>

33:08.392 --> 33:10.127
You know once you sign up...

33:10.129 --> 33:11.727
there's no changing your mind,
right?

33:11.729 --> 33:13.229
I know.

33:13.231 --> 33:14.864
What do you know?
You're just a kid.

33:14.866 --> 33:17.367
Whose country was attacked.

33:17.369 --> 33:19.636
Adam, I know you want to do what
you think is right...

33:19.638 --> 33:22.205
but war is not a video game.

33:22.207 --> 33:24.341
You have no idea what
you're getting into.

33:24.343 --> 33:26.711
I know exactly what
I'm getting into.

33:30.915 --> 33:33.149
Here.

33:33.151 --> 33:37.720
Show me where Afghanistan
is on this map.

33:37.722 --> 33:40.422
Show me.

33:40.424 --> 33:42.258
They're gonna send you halfway
around the world to fight...

33:42.260 --> 33:44.794
people you didn't even know
existed a year ago.

33:44.796 --> 33:47.496
If you know what you're
getting into...

33:47.498 --> 33:51.534
show me where Afghanistan
is on this map.

33:51.536 --> 33:54.603
Did anyone ever shove a map
in Dad's face...

33:54.605 --> 33:57.309
and ask him to find Vietnam?

34:03.614 --> 34:07.350
<i>We now know that
Saddam has resumed...</i>

34:07.352 --> 34:09.886
<i>his efforts to acquire
nuclear weapons.</i>

34:09.888 --> 34:12.688
<i>Among other sources, we've
gotten this from firsthand...</i>

34:12.690 --> 34:14.456
<i>testimony from defectors.</i>

34:14.458 --> 34:17.259
<i>Many of us are convinced
that Saddam Hussein...</i>

34:17.261 --> 34:19.962
<i>will acquire nuclear weapons
fairly soon.</i>

34:19.964 --> 34:23.799
<i>Simply stated, there is no
doubt that Saddam Hussein...</i>

34:23.801 --> 34:25.701
<i>now has weapons of mass
destruction.</i>

34:25.703 --> 34:28.605
They're dialing up
the rhetoric on Iraq.

34:28.607 --> 34:30.710
Let's see if we can nail
them down, okay?

34:32.777 --> 34:35.545
Twenty bucks, whoever gets
the best quote.

34:35.547 --> 34:38.480
No, no, no, you're such a child.

34:38.482 --> 34:39.616
You're such a pussy.

34:39.618 --> 34:41.217
I'm not taking your money.

34:41.219 --> 34:42.719
You get all bent out of shape
when you lose.

34:42.721 --> 34:44.487
I don't care. I'm just the same
when I win or lose.

34:44.489 --> 34:46.255
I'm not... it's not a bet,
all right, fine.

34:46.257 --> 34:47.857
Warren Strobel for Senator
Biden, please.

34:47.859 --> 34:49.692
Son of a bitch.

34:49.694 --> 34:52.362
Biden told Bush, "There's a
reason your father didn't go...

34:52.364 --> 34:53.529
"to Baghdad. He knew he would
have to stay...

34:53.531 --> 34:54.998
"for at least five years."

34:55.000 --> 34:57.667
I got Michael O'Hanlon
at Brookings saying...

34:57.669 --> 35:00.306
"You definitely cannot
count on it being a cakewalk."

35:01.672 --> 35:03.672
We gotta hit it harder
than that.

35:03.674 --> 35:05.908
All right, well, hang on. I got
an official at the U.N...

35:05.910 --> 35:07.611
that says, "There's widespread
concern...

35:07.613 --> 35:09.779
"that this will destabilize
the whole Middle East."

35:09.781 --> 35:12.348
Let me see what you have.

35:12.350 --> 35:13.616
Well, wait, I got... I got...

35:13.618 --> 35:15.585
Just give it to me,
give, give, give.

35:15.587 --> 35:16.752
Okay.

35:16.754 --> 35:18.788
All right.

35:18.790 --> 35:22.460
Let's see here... all right.

36:08.873 --> 36:10.940
You guys are smart.

36:10.942 --> 36:13.509
You know what's unfolding here.

36:13.511 --> 36:17.515
Our readers need to know what
we've learned.

36:21.085 --> 36:24.721
"In the best case scenario, U.S.
troops could be stuck in Iraq...

36:24.723 --> 36:27.891
"for years trying to teach the
inner workings of democracy...

36:27.893 --> 36:31.761
"to a nation that has never
known it. In the worst case...

36:31.763 --> 36:35.732
"scenario, an invasion could
cause Iraq's fractious ethnic...

36:35.734 --> 36:38.567
"groups to break off into their
own mini-states...

36:38.569 --> 36:41.603
"trapping American combat forces
in the middle...

36:41.605 --> 36:44.276
"of a bloody civil war
for decades."

36:46.777 --> 36:48.745
Boss man's got balls.

36:48.747 --> 36:50.815
Yeah.

37:16.107 --> 37:25.047
Shit.

37:25.049 --> 37:26.382
Were those for me?

37:26.384 --> 37:29.886
No. Yes.

37:29.888 --> 37:34.556
But I thought it might be
a little, I don't know...

37:34.558 --> 37:36.658
a little too soon to be giving
each other gifts.

37:36.660 --> 37:38.594
It would've been all right.

37:38.596 --> 37:39.862
Okay.

37:39.864 --> 37:42.498
Well, I think they landed
on my car...

37:42.500 --> 37:44.533
so if you want to grab them
on the way to dinner...

37:44.535 --> 37:46.603
maybe we can do that?

37:46.605 --> 37:48.474
- Great.
- Great.

37:51.609 --> 37:54.777
Okay, so what was the most
embarrassing thing...

37:54.779 --> 37:56.348
you did to prepare for tonight?

37:59.116 --> 38:01.083
All right.

38:01.085 --> 38:03.585
I will admit, that to prepare
for tonight...

38:03.587 --> 38:05.721
I did kind of a cram session
on Iraq...

38:05.723 --> 38:08.725
and the history of the Muslim
world.

38:08.727 --> 38:09.859
Really?

38:09.861 --> 38:11.627
Yes.

38:11.629 --> 38:14.129
Now I know that 1400 years ago,
after the death of Muhammad...

38:14.131 --> 38:16.498
Muslims fought over who was to
be his rightful heir...

38:16.500 --> 38:18.167
and that caused a split
into two factions...

38:18.169 --> 38:19.569
the Sunnis and the Shiites.

38:19.571 --> 38:21.136
And they've been at war
ever since.

38:21.138 --> 38:23.172
Then, at the end of World War I,
the British and the French...

38:23.174 --> 38:26.141
arbitrarily divided the Arab
world into countries...

38:26.143 --> 38:28.143
putting the Sunni majority
in charge.

38:28.145 --> 38:32.882
But the country that became Iraq
is made up of only 20% Sunni.

38:32.884 --> 38:37.554
So, Saddam Hussein, a Sunni,
with an iron fist rules...

38:37.556 --> 38:38.987
the majority Shiite
population...

38:38.989 --> 38:42.558
and the 20% Kurdish population
in northern Iraq.

38:42.560 --> 38:45.527
But if Saddam Hussein were
removed, it could possibly...

38:45.529 --> 38:48.096
reignite that 1400-year-old
sectarian war.

38:48.098 --> 38:50.199
Now, after reading <i>your</i>
stories...

38:50.201 --> 38:53.870
I know that Iran is the top
sponsor of terror, not Iraq.

38:53.872 --> 38:57.507
That a man named Ahmed Chalabi
seems to be a con artist...

38:57.509 --> 38:59.509
who wants to replace
Saddam Hussein.

38:59.511 --> 39:01.210
That the neo-cons in the Bush
Administration...

39:01.212 --> 39:02.846
are pushing for an invasion.

39:02.848 --> 39:06.482
And you are quickly becoming
my favorite writer.

39:06.484 --> 39:08.053
Wow.

39:12.122 --> 39:16.725
Um... I guess it's my turn.

39:16.727 --> 39:17.826
Give it to me.

39:17.828 --> 39:20.897
Okay, I will admit that...

39:20.899 --> 39:24.533
This is a little embarrassing.

39:24.535 --> 39:29.571
I asked my ex-wife to watch
my two sons tonight.

39:29.573 --> 39:31.140
Why is that embarrassing?

39:31.142 --> 39:33.076
Because a babysitter would
expect me home...

39:33.078 --> 39:37.013
at the end of the evening and...

39:37.015 --> 39:40.083
Should we get the check?

39:40.085 --> 39:43.553
Tell your boss we're gonna run
it whether he comments or not!

39:43.555 --> 39:46.656
Actually yes, it is a matter
of life and death!

39:46.658 --> 39:50.292
We're talking about going
to fucking war!

39:50.294 --> 39:52.730
Hello?

39:54.098 --> 39:56.866
I'm guessing that was
a no comment?

39:56.868 --> 39:59.067
What are you grinning
about?

39:59.069 --> 40:00.770
What? I'm not grinning.

40:00.772 --> 40:03.540
- You're grinning.
- I'm not grinning.

40:03.542 --> 40:04.908
- I'm not...
- What have you got over there?

40:04.910 --> 40:06.643
Relax! Don't worry about it.

40:06.645 --> 40:08.143
Oh my God, she could
do my taxes.

40:08.145 --> 40:10.045
All right, relax.

40:10.047 --> 40:12.685
- Strobel, Knight Ridder.
- Of course.

40:15.687 --> 40:17.819
Okay.

40:17.821 --> 40:20.123
All right, I'll be right there.

40:20.125 --> 40:22.094
Let's go, this could be
something.

40:26.997 --> 40:29.065
So, how does this work?

40:29.067 --> 40:32.171
Do you ask me questions or do
I just start talking?

40:33.270 --> 40:35.804
Why don't you just begin...

40:35.806 --> 40:37.205
and we'll ask the questions
when we have them.

40:37.207 --> 40:39.741
If it's off the record,
I have to say so, right?

40:39.743 --> 40:42.178
Do you want it to be
off the record?

40:42.180 --> 40:45.848
I want people to know what
I know, but not who I am.

40:45.850 --> 40:47.616
It'll be background.

40:47.618 --> 40:50.055
You'll be referred to
as a U.S. official.

40:56.962 --> 40:59.732
So, whatever you feel
comfortable telling us.

41:03.134 --> 41:06.335
I believe your prediction about
what could and will happen...

41:06.337 --> 41:08.904
if we go to war is spot on.

41:08.906 --> 41:11.641
And we're a lot closer
than you think.

41:11.643 --> 41:13.208
How close?

41:13.210 --> 41:16.279
A secret war planning group
with a parallel intelligence...

41:16.281 --> 41:18.880
operation has been set up
to bypass...

41:18.882 --> 41:21.150
the rest of the
intelligence community.

41:21.152 --> 41:22.685
How do you know this?

41:22.687 --> 41:25.120
They meet in the building
where I work.

41:25.122 --> 41:27.123
And which building is that?

41:27.125 --> 41:31.861
The one with the five sides.

41:31.863 --> 41:32.962
But you're not a part
of that unit?

41:32.964 --> 41:34.196
No.

41:34.198 --> 41:35.832
So, how do you know about this?

41:35.834 --> 41:38.100
My desk is across the hall.

41:38.102 --> 41:40.402
What office do you work for?

41:40.404 --> 41:45.007
Near East South Asia division,
but you can't disclose that.

41:45.009 --> 41:47.009
You're an analyst?

41:47.011 --> 41:51.047
Yes... but you can't disclose
that, either.

41:51.049 --> 41:53.315
I'm speaking to you because
I'm an American citizen...

41:53.317 --> 41:55.917
and I don't like what these
people are doing.

41:55.919 --> 41:59.288
Half a dozen men, most of whom
have never served...

41:59.290 --> 42:01.424
in the military are making
decisions...

42:01.426 --> 42:04.893
based on shoddy intelligence,
and those decisions...

42:04.895 --> 42:07.362
will impact our men
and women in uniform.

42:07.364 --> 42:14.670
And as someone who has worn that
uniform, I can't remain silent.

42:14.672 --> 42:19.975
You said shoddy intelligence.
What do you mean by that?

42:19.977 --> 42:23.078
They've designed a process
that doesn't conform...

42:23.080 --> 42:26.248
to any basic tenet
of intelligence gathering.

42:26.250 --> 42:27.750
In what way?

42:27.752 --> 42:29.951
A decision is made,
then the intelligence...

42:29.953 --> 42:33.388
is sought to support
that decision.

42:33.390 --> 42:34.991
How do you know this?

42:34.993 --> 42:37.993
They have no interest
in Arabic speakers.

42:37.995 --> 42:40.797
Israelis come in without
passes...

42:40.799 --> 42:43.966
without even being entered
into a security log.

42:43.968 --> 42:47.103
And for years the government has
been funding a group...

42:47.105 --> 42:51.473
of exiled dissidents called the
Iraqi National Congress.

42:51.475 --> 42:53.710
Led by Ahmad Chalabi, we know.

42:53.712 --> 42:56.745
Who they want to install
as the new leader of Iraq.

42:56.747 --> 42:58.815
Yeah, we've been trying to get
a meeting with him.

42:58.817 --> 43:01.085
Do you know who set up
this operation?

43:04.955 --> 43:07.890
Donald Rumsfeld.

43:07.892 --> 43:09.958
<i>Is there any evidence to
indicate that Iraq...</i>

43:09.960 --> 43:14.429
<i>has attempted to or is willing
to supply terrorists...</i>

43:14.431 --> 43:16.732
<i>with weapons of mass
destruction?</i>

43:16.734 --> 43:21.203
<i>The reports that say that
something hasn't happened...</i>

43:21.205 --> 43:24.841
<i>are always interesting to me
because as we know...</i>

43:24.843 --> 43:29.078
<i>there are known knowns, there
are things we know we know.</i>

43:29.080 --> 43:31.413
<i>We also know there are known
unknowns.</i>

43:31.415 --> 43:34.951
<i>That is to say, we know there
are some things we do not know.</i>

43:34.953 --> 43:37.487
<i>But there are also unknown
unknowns.</i>

43:37.489 --> 43:39.321
<i>The one's we don't know
we don't know.</i>

43:39.323 --> 43:41.891
We're working on a theory that
the administration...

43:41.893 --> 43:43.391
has already decided to go
to war...

43:43.393 --> 43:45.328
and is now focused on how
to justify it.

43:45.330 --> 43:47.196
It's not a theory.

43:47.198 --> 43:49.766
We've also been told by a number
of individuals that...

43:49.768 --> 43:52.835
Rumsfeld's the one spearheading
this intelligence gathering.

43:52.837 --> 43:55.237
I wouldn't exactly
call it intelligence gathering.

43:55.239 --> 43:57.272
It's more like
intelligence cherry picking.

43:57.274 --> 43:58.940
And if they don't find
any cherries...

43:58.942 --> 44:00.509
they just grab a piece
of shit...

44:00.511 --> 44:03.879
and they paint it red, and they
stick it in a Shirley Temple.

44:03.881 --> 44:07.250
You seem irritated.

44:07.252 --> 44:09.919
I'm out there looking for
weapons that might not exist...

44:09.921 --> 44:12.487
to justify a war that might
not be wise.

44:12.489 --> 44:17.025
And have you found any evidence
of WMD?

44:17.027 --> 44:18.895
No, sir.

44:18.897 --> 44:21.029
But Saddam is looking to acquire
nukes, right?

44:21.031 --> 44:23.966
Yeah, and I'm trying to fuck
Jennifer Lopez, but I have...

44:23.968 --> 44:26.234
a sinking feeling that neither
of those things is gonna happen.

44:26.236 --> 44:31.040
So, we won't use your identity,
but can we get a quote?

44:31.042 --> 44:32.808
Sure.

44:32.810 --> 44:34.976
Have you found anything to
support the administration's...

44:34.978 --> 44:38.446
theory that Saddam is close to
or has acquired nuclear weapons?

44:38.448 --> 44:40.016
We've searched every cave...

44:40.018 --> 44:42.451
and looked up every camel's ass
in Iraq.

44:42.453 --> 44:47.292
So, here's your quote,
"no fucking way."

44:49.194 --> 44:51.027
Might have to clean
that up a bit.

44:51.029 --> 44:54.129
Quite colorful, though.

44:54.131 --> 44:55.263
Uh, honey, I think someone...

44:55.265 --> 44:56.966
is stealing our New York Times.

44:56.968 --> 44:58.301
I canceled it.

44:58.303 --> 45:00.169
Why would you do that?

45:00.171 --> 45:01.437
It's propaganda.

45:01.439 --> 45:03.239
I need that for my work.

45:03.241 --> 45:05.607
It's packaging press releases
from the White House...

45:05.609 --> 45:07.609
the State Department, and the
Pentagon.

45:07.611 --> 45:09.514
Sorry, that's not a real
newspaper.

45:16.421 --> 45:18.987
How was your day?

45:18.989 --> 45:21.257
Warren and I met with some
gentleman...

45:21.259 --> 45:23.592
from the intelligence community
who confirmed that...

45:23.594 --> 45:25.627
there's no real evidence
to support...

45:25.629 --> 45:28.966
the administration's
claim on WMD.

45:31.435 --> 45:34.203
What have I been telling you?

45:34.205 --> 45:38.477
Well, unfortunately, I can't use
your gut as a reliable source.

45:43.448 --> 45:46.449
You know, this is what they do.
They lie.

45:46.451 --> 45:49.421
Yeah, and we try to hold
them accountable.

45:52.656 --> 45:55.324
I hope I'm wrong. I really,
really do.

45:55.326 --> 45:58.460
But the Bush Administration,
they don't care about the truth.

45:58.462 --> 46:01.196
They don't even respond to your
articles.

46:01.198 --> 46:04.299
If they want a war, they're
gonna get one.

46:04.301 --> 46:07.002
And there's nothing that you
or the first amendment...

46:07.004 --> 46:08.439
is gonna do to stop them.

46:22.319 --> 46:24.222
Extra, extra, read all about it.

46:30.428 --> 46:34.297
"Over the past 14 months, Iraq
has tried to buy thousands...

46:34.299 --> 46:37.500
"of specially design aluminum
tubes, which American...

46:37.502 --> 46:39.534
"officials believe were intended
as components...

46:39.536 --> 46:43.471
"of centrifuges to enrich
uranium."

46:43.473 --> 46:45.241
Well, one thing's for sure.

46:45.243 --> 46:46.676
What's that?

46:46.678 --> 46:49.181
We can't both be right.

46:52.683 --> 46:54.016
Who're you calling?

46:54.018 --> 46:55.951
Loose Nukes.

46:55.953 --> 46:57.520
If she wouldn't talk to you
about going into Iraq...

46:57.522 --> 47:00.121
what makes you think she's gonna
go on the record on WMD?

47:00.123 --> 47:03.127
Charm Offensive. Watch and
learn, son.

47:07.198 --> 47:08.667
Landay.

47:11.368 --> 47:14.469
- It's Joe Galloway.
- Wow.

47:14.471 --> 47:16.605
Man even walks like he has
a Bronze Star.

47:16.607 --> 47:17.973
<i>Hello.</i>

47:17.975 --> 47:20.275
Oh, hi, yeah, it's Landay.

47:20.277 --> 47:21.576
<i>Hello, Jonathan.</i>

47:21.578 --> 47:27.382
Hi. Crazy weather we're having,
huh?

47:27.384 --> 47:29.417
<i>You're calling me to chat
about the weather?</i>

47:29.419 --> 47:34.056
No, no, yeah. Actually, I wanted
to ask you about WMD.

47:34.058 --> 47:35.623
It'll be deep, deep background.

47:35.625 --> 47:37.292
<i>Goodbye, Jonathan.</i>

47:37.294 --> 47:40.228
No wait, don't hang up.

47:40.230 --> 47:44.199
That Charm Offensive...
that's formidable.

47:44.201 --> 47:48.471
Listen, we need you here.

47:48.473 --> 47:51.172
You've developed sources over
the years that have access...

47:51.174 --> 47:54.210
that Landay and Strobel
just can't get.

47:54.212 --> 47:55.611
I'll make it easy on you.

47:55.613 --> 47:57.413
I'll give you a column...

47:57.415 --> 48:01.449
and your name doesn't have to
appear on anything else.

48:01.451 --> 48:04.286
Whatever else you want to write
on the side, you can...

48:04.288 --> 48:06.554
and of course, there won't be
any glory, but...

48:06.556 --> 48:08.727
Glory's for young men.

48:11.361 --> 48:13.462
Let me percolate on it.

48:13.464 --> 48:15.531
<i>Let me turn to the issue
of Iraq.</i>

48:15.533 --> 48:18.567
<i>You have said that it poses...</i>

48:18.569 --> 48:20.803
<i>a mortal threat to the
United States.</i>

48:20.805 --> 48:24.406
<i>How? Define "mortal threat."</i>

48:24.408 --> 48:29.210
<i>Well, this'll take some time,
but it's important for us...</i>

48:29.212 --> 48:31.112
<i>as I mentioned earlier...</i>

48:31.114 --> 48:34.049
<i>to remember that the world
has changed, that prior to...</i>

48:34.051 --> 48:35.784
I'd forgotten the world
had changed.

48:35.786 --> 48:37.719
So did I. I'm so happy he
mentioned that.

48:37.721 --> 48:41.357
<i>What, specifically, has he
obtained that you believe...</i>

48:41.359 --> 48:43.792
<i>would enhance his nuclear
development program?</i>

48:43.794 --> 48:45.828
<i>Well, in the nuclear weapons
arena...</i>

48:45.830 --> 48:48.630
<i>you've got specifically
aluminum tubes.</i>

48:48.632 --> 48:50.399
<i>There's a story in The New York
Times this morning...</i>

48:50.401 --> 48:53.502
<i>this is and I want to attribute
to The Times.</i>

48:53.504 --> 48:55.437
<i>I don't want to talk about,
obviously...</i>

48:55.439 --> 48:58.607
<i>specific intelligence sources,
but it's now public that...</i>

48:58.609 --> 49:03.645
<i>in fact he has been seeking to
acquire, and we have been...</i>

49:03.647 --> 49:06.449
<i>able to intercept and prevent
him from acquiring...</i>

49:06.451 --> 49:08.150
<i>through this particular
channel...</i>

49:08.152 --> 49:10.286
<i>the kinds of tubes that are
necessary...</i>

49:10.288 --> 49:12.087
<i>to build a centrifuge.</i>

49:12.089 --> 49:15.123
<i>And the centrifuge is required
to take low-grade uranium...</i>

49:15.125 --> 49:18.560
<i>and enhance it into highly
enriched uranium...</i>

49:18.562 --> 49:21.330
<i>which is what you have to have
in order to build a bomb.</i>

49:21.332 --> 49:23.866
Lucky for him, someone leaked
that to The Times.

49:23.868 --> 49:27.169
Avoids the pesky nuisance
of being arrested...

49:27.171 --> 49:28.804
for revealing classified
information.

49:28.806 --> 49:30.839
One can only wonder how Judy
Miller and Michael Gordon...

49:30.841 --> 49:31.873
got that information.

49:31.875 --> 49:35.578
<i>Does it bother you, bug you...</i>

49:35.580 --> 49:38.714
<i>that you have not captured
Osama bin Laden in over a year?</i>

49:38.716 --> 49:45.453
<i>I'd like to see him on
television in handcuffs...</i>

49:45.455 --> 49:47.489
<i>if I can put it
into those terms.</i>

49:47.491 --> 49:49.458
<i>I think all of us would.</i>

49:49.460 --> 49:53.228
<i>But I don't lay awake at night
concerned about that.</i>

49:53.230 --> 49:55.563
<i>There's one school of thought
that says he's already dead.</i>

49:55.565 --> 49:57.165
<i>We haven't heard anything
of him in many months.</i>

49:57.167 --> 49:58.533
<i>What do you think?</i>

49:58.535 --> 49:59.634
<i>I don't know, I really
don't know.</i>

49:59.636 --> 50:01.569
<i>I can argue it round or flat.</i>

50:01.571 --> 50:04.172
I didn't know we were still
debating the shape of the earth.

50:04.174 --> 50:06.143
I've got sources on both sides.

50:08.212 --> 50:10.645
<i>But the U.S. military would be
enormously effective...</i>

50:10.647 --> 50:12.515
<i>in this circumstance.</i>

50:12.517 --> 50:15.451
<i>And I don't think it would be
that tough a fight.</i>

50:15.453 --> 50:17.386
<i>That is, I don't think there's
any question...</i>

50:17.388 --> 50:19.221
<i>that we would prevail and we
would achieve our objective.</i>

50:19.223 --> 50:21.656
Landay.

50:21.658 --> 50:24.292
Yeah?

50:24.294 --> 50:26.630
We are right, aren't we?

50:28.866 --> 50:30.835
Everybody, listen up.

50:34.839 --> 50:36.808
We're not NBC.

50:38.276 --> 50:40.341
We're not ABC. We're not CBS.

50:40.343 --> 50:43.347
We're not FOX. We're not CNN.

50:44.482 --> 50:46.582
We're not The New York Times.

50:46.584 --> 50:48.553
We're not The Washington Post.

50:50.453 --> 50:52.423
We are Knight Ridder.

50:56.527 --> 51:02.598
We have readers who live in
towns with military bases.

51:02.600 --> 51:06.335
Fort Benning, Fort Bragg,
Fort Jackson...

51:06.337 --> 51:12.674
and over 40 other military bases
throughout this country.

51:12.676 --> 51:17.446
If every other news organization
wants to be stenographers...

51:17.448 --> 51:20.518
for the Bush administration,
let them.

51:22.786 --> 51:26.658
We don't write for people who
send other people's kids to war.

51:28.725 --> 51:33.198
We write for people
whose kids get sent to war.

51:35.866 --> 51:38.333
So, when the government
says something...

51:38.335 --> 51:40.839
you only have one question
to ask.

51:44.341 --> 51:46.277
Is it true?

51:52.450 --> 51:54.386
I'm through percolating.

51:57.488 --> 51:59.420
Let's get to work.

51:59.422 --> 52:01.690
Administration officials spanned
out on the Sunday talk shows...

52:01.692 --> 52:03.926
to make the case for an invasion
of Iraq.

52:03.928 --> 52:06.895
Who else is involved in
The Office of Special Planning?

52:06.897 --> 52:10.598
Wolfowitz, Feith, couple others.

52:10.600 --> 52:12.967
Instead of listening to people
who have spent their careers...

52:12.969 --> 52:16.804
evaluating threats, they're
streaming questionable intel...

52:16.806 --> 52:18.707
from unreliable sources and
taking it...

52:18.709 --> 52:20.509
directly to the White House.

52:20.511 --> 52:22.745
<i>George Tenet, Director
of Central Intelligence...</i>

52:22.747 --> 52:25.346
<i>told Senators, he could not
rule out cooperation...</i>

52:25.348 --> 52:26.617
<i>between Osama bin Laden
and Al Qaeda.</i>

52:29.386 --> 52:31.587
I've seen the specs on those
aluminum tubes.

52:31.589 --> 52:33.621
They're too small to be used
for enriching uranium.

52:33.623 --> 52:35.024
What does that mean?

52:35.026 --> 52:36.792
They can't be used
for a nuclear bomb.

52:36.794 --> 52:38.594
<i>The President
of the United States...</i>

52:38.596 --> 52:39.928
<i>said we're not going to permit
nations to develop...</i>

52:39.930 --> 52:41.897
<i>weapons of mass destruction...</i>

52:41.899 --> 52:43.699
<i>as they're gonna supply those
weapons to a network...</i>

52:43.701 --> 52:45.366
<i>of terrorism that could attack
the United States.</i>

52:45.368 --> 52:47.870
Cheney is trying to shut
out Powell.

52:47.872 --> 52:49.471
Where'd you get this stuff?

52:49.473 --> 52:51.339
Old friend.

52:51.341 --> 52:53.375
<i>We're starting to
see a consensus from within...</i>

52:53.377 --> 52:55.377
<i>the administration for the
removal of Saddam Hussein.</i>

52:55.379 --> 52:57.379
<i>The
administration has pointed...</i>

52:57.381 --> 52:59.681
<i>to a secret meeting in Prague
between Iraqi intelligence...</i>

52:59.683 --> 53:01.449
<i>and 9/11 hijacker,
Mohamed Atta.</i>

53:01.451 --> 53:03.419
<i>Bush administration is pressing
the United Nations...</i>

53:03.421 --> 53:05.554
<i>Security Council for
a resolution...</i>

53:05.556 --> 53:07.455
<i>to put pressure on Iraq.</i>

53:07.457 --> 53:09.424
<i>President Bush will address
the United Nations today...</i>

53:09.426 --> 53:11.759
<i>in hopes of putting together
a multi-national coalition...</i>

53:11.761 --> 53:13.594
<i>to disarm Saddam Hussein.</i>

53:13.596 --> 53:15.698
<i>The White House is lobbying
Congress to authorize...</i>

53:15.700 --> 53:17.799
<i>the use of force in Iraq.</i>

53:17.801 --> 53:19.868
The minute these guys get
their hands on anything...

53:19.870 --> 53:21.536
remotely resembling evidence...

53:21.538 --> 53:23.471
they leak it to
The New York Times.

53:23.473 --> 53:24.873
Now, I understand the position
you're in...

53:24.875 --> 53:27.509
but please don't hang up on me.

53:27.511 --> 53:28.976
<i>Okay.</i>

53:28.978 --> 53:32.547
Okay, the vice president
of the United States...

53:32.549 --> 53:35.984
went to the V.F.W. and said that
Saddam Hussein...

53:35.986 --> 53:38.953
is on the threshold of
developing a nuclear weapon.

53:38.955 --> 53:41.556
Then he goes on national
television...

53:41.558 --> 53:42.790
and says the same thing.

53:42.792 --> 53:46.060
<i>Your question?</i>

53:46.062 --> 53:49.498
Ask the question.

53:49.500 --> 53:52.533
What I want to know is,
is Dick Cheney ignoring...

53:52.535 --> 53:55.103
good intelligence that
contradicts his assumptions...

53:55.105 --> 53:59.074
or is he just getting bad
intelligence?

53:59.076 --> 54:02.681
<i>The vice president is lying.</i>

54:04.881 --> 54:06.781
Thank you, thank you so much.

54:06.783 --> 54:09.051
What? What, what, what?
What'd she say?

54:09.053 --> 54:10.786
He's lying.

54:10.788 --> 54:12.788
- He's lying.
- Cheney is lying.

54:12.790 --> 54:14.989
- Cheney's lying!
- Cheney's lying!

54:14.991 --> 54:17.525
- He's lying! John!
- He's lying!

54:17.527 --> 54:19.627
John!

54:19.629 --> 54:20.862
Where the hell is he?

54:20.864 --> 54:22.531
Here we go. Here we go.

54:22.533 --> 54:24.466
- He's lying.
- He's lying.

54:24.468 --> 54:26.435
Cheney's lying.

54:26.437 --> 54:27.870
Where did this come from?

54:27.872 --> 54:29.538
Loose Nukes.

54:29.540 --> 54:31.440
Okay.

54:31.442 --> 54:33.808
Now, we know what's being talk
about, we got to get inside...

54:33.810 --> 54:36.812
those meetings and find out if
there's a dissenting opinion.

54:36.814 --> 54:38.614
I may have a guy.

54:38.616 --> 54:40.047
Anybody we know?

54:40.049 --> 54:41.652
The Usual Suspect.

54:52.897 --> 54:54.862
You didn't want to do
this in a parking garage?

54:54.864 --> 54:57.498
If there was one that served
Pad Thai, I would.

54:57.500 --> 54:59.902
How's civilian life?

54:59.904 --> 55:02.504
My retirement lasted about
four hours.

55:02.506 --> 55:04.205
You're with Knight Ridder?

55:04.207 --> 55:06.574
I don't even have a desk yet.
How the hell do you know that?

55:06.576 --> 55:08.076
I have my ways.

55:08.078 --> 55:09.944
You been following what we're
doing over there?

55:09.946 --> 55:11.179
Yes, I have.

55:11.181 --> 55:12.681
And?

55:12.683 --> 55:14.449
You two may be singlehandedly
saving...

55:14.451 --> 55:17.553
the Fourth Estate from
extinction.

55:17.555 --> 55:20.221
Mainstream media hasn't picked
up a thing we been running.

55:20.223 --> 55:21.857
Should be all the confirmation
you need...

55:21.859 --> 55:23.094
that you're onto something.

55:26.062 --> 55:28.696
What can I do for you?

55:28.698 --> 55:30.732
We need some help with the
higher ups.

55:30.734 --> 55:31.732
How high?

55:31.734 --> 55:33.469
High as you can get us.

55:33.471 --> 55:35.170
You've been around a long time,
Joe.

55:35.172 --> 55:37.672
I doubt there's anything there
that'll surprise you.

55:37.674 --> 55:39.475
I was married one time
to a woman who thought...

55:39.477 --> 55:41.643
New Hampshire was the capital
of Massachusetts.

55:41.645 --> 55:44.612
There's always something you
don't see coming.

55:44.614 --> 55:47.949
What do you want to know?

55:47.951 --> 55:51.053
Everything the administration
doesn't want us to know.

55:51.055 --> 55:54.459
You and I are going to be eating
a lot of Pad Thai.

55:59.497 --> 56:01.496
What kind of time frame
are we looking at?

56:01.498 --> 56:02.897
Next month, Congress
is scheduled to vote...

56:02.899 --> 56:04.165
on whether or not to give
the president...

56:04.167 --> 56:05.868
the authorization to go to war.

56:05.870 --> 56:06.935
Are the votes there?

56:06.937 --> 56:08.603
The administration thinks so.

56:08.605 --> 56:14.009
Mr. President, 38 years ago,
I, Robert C. Byrd...

56:14.011 --> 56:17.612
voted on the Tonkin Gulf
Resolution.

56:17.614 --> 56:21.149
The resolution that authorized
the president to use military...

56:21.151 --> 56:23.150
force to repel armed attacks...

56:23.152 --> 56:27.589
and to prevent further communist
aggression in Southeast Asia.

56:27.591 --> 56:31.225
A joint resolution to authorize
the use of United States...

56:31.227 --> 56:34.730
armed forces against Iraq should
be brought to a close.

56:34.732 --> 56:36.931
The clerk will call the roll.

56:36.933 --> 56:39.134
<i>Mr. Biden, aye.</i>

56:39.136 --> 56:41.169
<i>Mrs. Clinton, aye.</i>

56:41.171 --> 56:43.638
It was this resolution that
provided the basis...

56:43.640 --> 56:47.542
for American involvement
in the war in Vietnam.

56:47.544 --> 56:49.877
<i>Mr. Kerry, aye.</i>

56:49.879 --> 56:52.047
<i>Mr. Lieberman, aye.</i>

56:52.049 --> 56:54.016
<i>Mr. Lott, aye.</i>

56:54.018 --> 56:55.951
It was this resolution...

56:55.953 --> 57:00.989
that lead to the deaths
of 58,000 Americans.

57:00.991 --> 57:03.324
<i>Mr. McCain, aye.</i>

57:03.326 --> 57:05.560
<i>Mr. McConnell, aye.</i>

57:05.562 --> 57:10.699
After all that carnage, we began
to learn that in voting...

57:10.701 --> 57:12.768
for the Tonkin Gulf
resolution...

57:12.770 --> 57:15.904
we were basing our votes
on bad information.

57:15.906 --> 57:18.172
And history is repeating itself.

57:18.174 --> 57:20.308
<i>Mr. Santorum, aye.</i>

57:20.310 --> 57:23.679
I urge senators to go down
on the Capital Mall...

57:23.681 --> 57:26.181
and look at the Vietnam
Memorial.

57:26.183 --> 57:29.250
Nearly every day, you will find
someone at that wall...

57:29.252 --> 57:31.587
weeping for a loved one.

57:31.589 --> 57:33.654
<i>Mr. Sessions, aye.</i>

57:33.656 --> 57:36.158
I will always remember the words
of Senator Wayne Morse.

57:36.160 --> 57:38.627
<i>Mr. Specter, aye.</i>

57:38.629 --> 57:40.895
He stated, "The resolution will
pass and senators...

57:40.897 --> 57:44.632
"who vote for it will live
to regret it."

57:44.634 --> 57:46.667
We got K-10, we got Dixie,
we don't need another source.

57:46.669 --> 57:48.270
You know we got this.

57:48.272 --> 57:50.237
Look, when you're accusing the
secretary of defense...

57:50.239 --> 57:52.107
of running a shadow
intelligence unit...

57:52.109 --> 57:54.676
out of the Pentagon, it's nice
to have a little insurance.

57:54.678 --> 57:55.913
That's all I'm saying.

57:59.984 --> 58:02.350
All right, let's share it
with the rest of the class.

58:02.352 --> 58:04.085
You want to tell them?

58:04.087 --> 58:07.723
Earlier today, I was summoned
to the Pentagon.

58:07.725 --> 58:09.056
By whom?

58:09.058 --> 58:12.127
Rumsfeld, Ol' Limp Dick
sent a message saying...

58:12.129 --> 58:13.929
"All your sources are retired
generals."

58:13.931 --> 58:15.864
And I said, "All due respect,
sir...

58:15.866 --> 58:18.799
"80% of my sources are
active military."

58:18.801 --> 58:20.636
"Some of them are working
in this building...

58:20.638 --> 58:22.837
"and some of them are actually
working on your staff."

58:22.839 --> 58:25.806
"And hell, one or two of them
might even be in this room."

58:25.808 --> 58:27.942
Did you actually have sources
in the room?

58:27.944 --> 58:31.082
No, but it was fun watching him
sweat like whores in church.

58:33.817 --> 58:35.783
How close are we to getting
something we can run with

58:35.785 --> 58:37.185
on the Office of Special Plans?

58:37.187 --> 58:39.020
Well, we already got...

58:39.022 --> 58:41.656
No, we're just gonna check
with a couple more sources.

58:41.658 --> 58:43.658
What's wrong with the sources
you have?

58:43.660 --> 58:46.094
Well, we just want to be
certain.

58:46.096 --> 58:49.096
You know, you sit on a story
like this, the dam bursts.

58:49.098 --> 58:51.001
Let's just move on this,
okay, boys?

58:54.904 --> 58:56.237
When are you gonna be finished?

58:56.239 --> 59:00.243
Just a few more minutes, baby.

59:02.846 --> 59:06.781
I can't sleep with the computer
light on.

59:06.783 --> 59:09.219
Actually, I'm done.

59:13.690 --> 59:17.025
So, what are you working on?

59:17.027 --> 59:19.828
Rumsfeld has a secret Intel
group that's going...

59:19.830 --> 59:24.835
around the CIA to manufacture
a case for war.

59:29.239 --> 59:31.440
What the fuck, Jonathan?

59:31.442 --> 59:33.107
What?

59:33.109 --> 59:35.078
Have you been talking about this
on the phone?

59:37.281 --> 59:38.779
Yeah, of course.

59:38.781 --> 59:40.651
So, what?

59:43.187 --> 59:47.188
- They will hear you.
- Vlatka.

59:47.190 --> 59:49.824
You're writing about infighting
between spy agencies.

59:49.826 --> 59:50.926
So?

59:50.928 --> 59:53.328
They're spy agencies, Jonathan.

59:53.330 --> 59:55.964
They listen to your calls,
they read your emails.

59:55.966 --> 59:57.966
They probably bugged this house.

59:57.968 --> 59:59.967
You're being paranoid.

59:59.969 --> 01:00:01.335
You're being naive.

01:00:01.337 --> 01:00:04.739
This isn't Yugoslavia,
this is America.

01:00:04.741 --> 01:00:07.007
America has changed.

01:00:07.009 --> 01:00:08.375
War is big business for them.

01:00:08.377 --> 01:00:11.045
You get in their way,
they're gonna kill you.

01:00:11.047 --> 01:00:15.817
Honey, you are being ridiculous.
All right? Come on.

01:00:15.819 --> 01:00:19.054
Don't you get it?

01:00:19.056 --> 01:00:21.890
You know what these people
are capable of?

01:00:21.892 --> 01:00:24.493
You have a family!

01:00:24.495 --> 01:00:28.098
Vlatka. Vlatka!

01:00:32.902 --> 01:00:37.239
Oh, somebody's struggling.
What's the matter?

01:00:37.241 --> 01:00:40.542
Oh, Vlatka kept me up all night.

01:00:40.544 --> 01:00:42.176
All right!

01:00:42.178 --> 01:00:46.047
No, not that like that. It was
conspiracy theories.

01:00:46.049 --> 01:00:47.415
About what?

01:00:47.417 --> 01:00:50.951
Oh... she thinks the government
is monitoring us.

01:00:50.953 --> 01:00:54.124
I mean, it's ridiculous.

01:00:56.225 --> 01:00:57.761
Check your email.

01:01:09.906 --> 01:01:11.839
John, you got to see this.

01:01:11.841 --> 01:01:14.042
Oh, hold on a second.

01:01:14.044 --> 01:01:17.248
Arthur, I really don't want to
have this conversation again.

01:01:19.382 --> 01:01:22.819
He hung up. What is it?

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.362
What do we do?

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.047
- You're such a wuss.
- You're a wuss.

01:01:52.049 --> 01:01:54.015
You're a much bigger wuss.

01:01:54.017 --> 01:01:55.516
Shut up, will you stop it,
you're being a child.

01:01:55.518 --> 01:01:57.484
- You're being a...
- Shut up!

01:01:57.486 --> 01:02:00.554
<i>Today's UN Security
Council resolution...</i>

01:02:00.556 --> 01:02:04.558
<i>can be boiled down to four
words, the clock is ticking.</i>

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.596
<i>Iraq's only alternative to full
compliance, President Bush...</i>

01:02:08.598 --> 01:02:11.632
<i>made clear today, is
of military confrontation.</i>

01:02:11.634 --> 01:02:14.902
<i>The full disarmament of
weapons of mass destruction...</i>

01:02:14.904 --> 01:02:16.471
<i>by Iraq will occur.</i>

01:02:16.473 --> 01:02:22.246
<i>The only question for the Iraqi
regime is to decide how.</i>

01:02:34.091 --> 01:02:35.422
Son of a bitch.

01:02:35.424 --> 01:02:37.125
They beat us.

01:02:37.127 --> 01:02:39.326
But they missed the whole point
of why the unit was set up.

01:02:39.328 --> 01:02:40.629
It doesn't matter, they got
the scoop.

01:02:40.631 --> 01:02:42.330
With what?

01:02:42.332 --> 01:02:44.199
There's nothing about
cherry picking intelligence.

01:02:44.201 --> 01:02:46.433
There's nothing about bypassing
other agencies.

01:02:46.435 --> 01:02:48.036
We can still run ours.

01:02:48.038 --> 01:02:49.337
John, no one's gonna pay
attention...

01:02:49.339 --> 01:02:52.140
to a second story explaining
all that.

01:02:52.142 --> 01:02:53.908
We had it.

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:55.911
Goddamn it, Walcott's gonna be
pissed.

01:02:55.913 --> 01:02:58.115
Maybe he hadn't seen it yet.

01:03:11.661 --> 01:03:14.462
How is it possible he hasn't
talked to us all day?

01:03:14.464 --> 01:03:17.134
He's giving us the silent
treatment.

01:03:20.136 --> 01:03:22.136
Oh, shit, here he comes.

01:03:22.138 --> 01:03:24.307
Oh, Jesus.

01:03:29.546 --> 01:03:31.549
You had the story.

01:03:33.317 --> 01:03:35.319
Don't ever forget how
it feels to get beat.

01:03:39.723 --> 01:03:42.156
The only information Congress
is getting...

01:03:42.158 --> 01:03:44.359
is coming directly from the
administration.

01:03:44.361 --> 01:03:47.194
<i>Iraq is a huge country about
the size of France...</i>

01:03:47.196 --> 01:03:49.230
<i>if they want to hide their
weapons of mass destruction...</i>

01:03:49.232 --> 01:03:50.998
<i>they're going to be able
to do so.</i>

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.368
They're not going to rethink
their positions...

01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:56.004
unless they are provided
with independent intel.

01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:58.640
<i>No one who's supported the
authorization for war...</i>

01:03:58.642 --> 01:04:02.377
<i>in Congress, in Iraq, not the
president...</i>

01:04:02.379 --> 01:04:06.348
<i>I am sure would go to war just
because he wants to go to war.</i>

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:09.984
Rumsfeld's been trying to sell
this idea that an Iraqi...

01:04:09.986 --> 01:04:13.754
intelligence officer offered
bin Laden safe haven in '99.

01:04:13.756 --> 01:04:15.290
Yeah.

01:04:15.292 --> 01:04:17.525
Well, if that offer actually
had happened...

01:04:17.527 --> 01:04:20.661
bin Laden would have told Saddam
to go fuck himself.

01:04:20.663 --> 01:04:22.663
What do you make of the
statement made...

01:04:22.665 --> 01:04:25.266
by the Iraqi government that
Iraq has no weapons...

01:04:25.268 --> 01:04:27.634
of mass destruction
and is not developing?

01:04:27.636 --> 01:04:29.406
They're lying.

01:04:31.241 --> 01:04:32.607
Next.

01:04:32.609 --> 01:04:34.208
Your daughter is lovely.

01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:35.777
Well, I wish I could take
credit.

01:04:35.779 --> 01:04:37.478
She gets it from her mother.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.679
Dad, can I get you
anything?

01:04:38.681 --> 01:04:40.515
- Oh, no, thanks, sweetie.
- Mr. Strobel?

01:04:40.517 --> 01:04:42.319
- I'm fine.
- All right.

01:04:45.489 --> 01:04:47.221
Just real casual.

01:04:47.223 --> 01:04:48.790
Tom and I were just talking
about your latest article.

01:04:48.792 --> 01:04:50.324
Oh, yeah?

01:04:50.326 --> 01:04:52.092
Seems like you don't trust
politicians.

01:04:52.094 --> 01:04:55.129
Well, that's a pretty solid
rule of journalism.

01:04:55.131 --> 01:04:57.232
Even when they're talking
about war?

01:04:57.234 --> 01:04:59.466
Especially when they're talking
about war.

01:04:59.468 --> 01:05:01.569
You really believe there's
no WMD?

01:05:01.571 --> 01:05:03.638
Our names are on the article.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.640
They don't say that
there's no WMD.

01:05:05.642 --> 01:05:07.141
They just said that the
administration...

01:05:07.143 --> 01:05:08.576
hasn't offered any proof of WMD.

01:05:08.578 --> 01:05:10.645
And you don't think
they'll find any?

01:05:10.647 --> 01:05:13.614
No, I don't.

01:05:13.616 --> 01:05:14.815
You don't know that.

01:05:14.817 --> 01:05:16.551
No, we don't.

01:05:16.553 --> 01:05:18.752
But before we send our kids
to their possible deaths...

01:05:18.754 --> 01:05:20.487
don't you think the
administration...

01:05:20.489 --> 01:05:22.390
has an obligation to provide
proof of their rationale?

01:05:22.392 --> 01:05:25.560
What if that proof comes in the
form of a mushroom cloud?

01:05:25.562 --> 01:05:28.730
Okay, you've been watching
Fox News again?

01:05:28.732 --> 01:05:31.332
Rice, Cheney, and President Bush
have all said the same thing.

01:05:31.334 --> 01:05:33.301
Oh, well, then it must be true.

01:05:33.303 --> 01:05:35.270
You kids are too young
to remember...

01:05:35.272 --> 01:05:37.672
how close we came to nuclear war
in '62.

01:05:37.674 --> 01:05:39.540
Hell, Warren, you were born
the very day...

01:05:39.542 --> 01:05:42.777
President Kennedy ordered the
blockade against Cuba.

01:05:42.779 --> 01:05:45.612
The most powerful enemy we knew
was gonna put nuclear weapons...

01:05:45.614 --> 01:05:47.714
90 miles off our coast.

01:05:47.716 --> 01:05:49.551
The president had to demonstrate
strength.

01:05:49.553 --> 01:05:53.455
And the next day, Kennedy sent
Adlai Stevenson to the U.N...

01:05:53.457 --> 01:05:55.558
to offer proof that the missiles
existed.

01:05:56.759 --> 01:05:58.592
It's not just Fox News.

01:05:58.594 --> 01:06:01.862
It's the Washington Post.
It's The New York Times.

01:06:01.864 --> 01:06:04.799
Hell, proof is coming from every
major media outlet...

01:06:04.801 --> 01:06:07.705
in the country, except yours.

01:06:09.272 --> 01:06:10.804
Okay.

01:06:10.806 --> 01:06:16.413
Uh, I think I forgot the
hamburger buns, excuse me.

01:06:18.114 --> 01:06:20.750
I'm going to grab a beer.

01:06:23.352 --> 01:06:25.121
Jesus, Dad.

01:06:36.299 --> 01:06:37.464
Are you okay, bro?

01:06:37.466 --> 01:06:39.069
Yeah.

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:44.172
Are we good reporters?

01:06:44.174 --> 01:06:45.272
What?

01:06:45.274 --> 01:06:48.208
I mean, are we doing anything...

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:49.877
other than practicing good
journalism?

01:06:49.879 --> 01:06:51.913
No, we're doing exactly what
we're supposed...

01:06:51.915 --> 01:06:54.449
Then, why the fuck are we
the only ones...

01:06:54.451 --> 01:06:56.620
running these fucking stories?!

01:07:04.527 --> 01:07:06.828
He just wanted you to see
all sides to him...

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:08.466
before you take it to the
next level.

01:07:13.770 --> 01:07:15.569
<i>Almost three months ago,
the United Nations...</i>

01:07:15.571 --> 01:07:17.739
<i>Security Council gave
Saddam Hussein...</i>

01:07:17.741 --> 01:07:20.942
<i>his final chance to disarm.</i>

01:07:20.944 --> 01:07:22.777
<i>Our intelligence officials
estimate...</i>

01:07:22.779 --> 01:07:24.645
<i>that Saddam Hussein had the
materials to produce...</i>

01:07:24.647 --> 01:07:27.549
What's the point of having
U.N. weapons inspections...

01:07:27.551 --> 01:07:30.185
if Bush and Cheney are just
going to ignore the results?

01:07:30.187 --> 01:07:33.254
Well, when you're creating
your own reality...

01:07:33.256 --> 01:07:35.255
it's pretty easy to ignore
the facts.

01:07:35.257 --> 01:07:37.357
And so what? Due diligence is
too inconvenient...

01:07:37.359 --> 01:07:39.861
for the mainstream media
at this point?

01:07:39.863 --> 01:07:41.763
When news is a profit center...

01:07:41.765 --> 01:07:43.531
Access becomes currency.

01:07:43.533 --> 01:07:44.668
Exactly.

01:07:46.402 --> 01:07:47.634
I'm proud of you, John.

01:07:47.636 --> 01:07:48.703
Why?

01:07:48.705 --> 01:07:52.473
For not wavering.

01:07:52.475 --> 01:07:53.841
It's got to be tough.

01:07:53.843 --> 01:07:55.542
It's not that tough.

01:07:55.544 --> 01:07:59.746
I know who their sources are and
I know who our sources are.

01:07:59.748 --> 01:08:03.384
"Iraqi Dissidents Reassured
in a Talk with Bush...

01:08:03.386 --> 01:08:06.587
"About the Post-Hussein Era."

01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:07.922
By Judith Miller.

01:08:07.924 --> 01:08:09.656
She'd quote a carnival
fortune teller...

01:08:09.658 --> 01:08:12.426
if he was willing to say
Iraq had WMD.

01:08:12.428 --> 01:08:15.230
We gotta dig into the
declassified...

01:08:15.232 --> 01:08:16.596
national intelligence
estimate...

01:08:16.599 --> 01:08:19.234
and find out if there are any
gems in there.

01:08:19.236 --> 01:08:20.301
Yeah, I'd love to see...

01:08:20.304 --> 01:08:22.770
what they redacted from the
classified version.

01:08:22.772 --> 01:08:24.371
Oh, what's going
on with Chalabi?

01:08:24.372 --> 01:08:25.707
We're on it.

01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:26.908
I'm gonna keep an eye
on my old boss.

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:28.709
- I got a feeling.
- Yeah...

01:08:28.711 --> 01:08:31.714
Colin may be the last person
standing between peace and war.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:34.919
Yeah.

01:08:42.559 --> 01:08:44.461
Goddamn it!

01:08:49.965 --> 01:08:51.367
Fuck!

01:08:56.773 --> 01:08:58.471
Angela, did the mayor
set a date...

01:08:58.474 --> 01:08:59.673
for the fundraiser yet?

01:08:59.675 --> 01:09:02.643
Hey, Arthur, I was totally
wrong.

01:09:02.645 --> 01:09:05.545
Your head isn't literally
up your ass.

01:09:05.546 --> 01:09:08.348
It's always a pleasure to see
you, John...

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:10.884
but would you please wait
outside?

01:09:10.886 --> 01:09:13.386
You know, it's bad enough you're
ignoring all our work...

01:09:13.389 --> 01:09:15.756
but the fact that you're running
these bullshit...

01:09:15.759 --> 01:09:19.326
Judy Miller pieces is
unconscionable.

01:09:19.328 --> 01:09:20.727
Not in here, John.
Okay, please?

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:24.631
Let's take it in my office.
Excuse me.

01:09:24.634 --> 01:09:26.801
Jesus.

01:09:26.803 --> 01:09:28.569
Look, as painful as this
might seem...

01:09:28.571 --> 01:09:30.370
I don't answer to you, John.

01:09:30.372 --> 01:09:32.538
Yes, as evidenced by the fact
that you still have a job.

01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:34.642
You know what, my responsibility
is to my readers.

01:09:34.644 --> 01:09:36.310
They're citizens who are
patriots...

01:09:36.313 --> 01:09:37.978
they're citizens who support
our troops.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:40.080
And how do you do that, Arthur?

01:09:40.082 --> 01:09:42.649
By going down on
The New York Times?

01:09:42.652 --> 01:09:44.551
I don't have time for this.

01:09:44.554 --> 01:09:45.986
No, you don't have time.

01:09:45.988 --> 01:09:47.554
You don't have time.

01:09:47.555 --> 01:09:48.955
You know, one day,
The New York Times...

01:09:48.957 --> 01:09:50.792
is going to apologize
to its readers.

01:09:50.794 --> 01:09:54.529
And when that day comes, are you
gonna write your own apology?

01:09:54.531 --> 01:09:56.931
Or are you just going to run
theirs?

01:09:56.933 --> 01:09:58.868
Have a nice day, John.

01:10:01.403 --> 01:10:03.338
<i>It is beginning to look more
and more as though...</i>

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.539
<i>war with Iraq is inevitable.</i>

01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:08.543
<i>The Showdown with Iraq and the
countdown to a speech...</i>

01:10:08.545 --> 01:10:10.744
<i>by Secretary of State
Colin Powell...</i>

01:10:10.746 --> 01:10:12.946
<i>that could move the world
closer to war.</i>

01:10:12.948 --> 01:10:15.415
<i>There's not much left for the
soldiers to do but wait...</i>

01:10:15.417 --> 01:10:18.886
<i>for orders to attack, Ryan
Chillcoat reports...</i>

01:10:18.888 --> 01:10:21.888
That's so frustrating.

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:23.794
I don't know that I could
do what you do.

01:10:25.929 --> 01:10:27.462
You know, I once got it
in my head...

01:10:27.464 --> 01:10:29.530
that I should hike the
Appalachian Trail.

01:10:29.532 --> 01:10:31.766
Thought that it would just be a
good challenge for myself.

01:10:31.768 --> 01:10:35.372
Then I look at it on a map
and it's like 2200 miles.

01:10:37.573 --> 01:10:39.374
I realized...

01:10:39.376 --> 01:10:40.975
That it would take a lifetime?

01:10:40.977 --> 01:10:42.712
Yeah.

01:10:46.148 --> 01:10:47.817
Or we could walk it together.

01:10:49.885 --> 01:10:53.987
I'm gonna hold you to that.

01:10:53.989 --> 01:10:55.856
<i>Worldwide resistance
is mounting...</i>

01:10:55.858 --> 01:10:59.593
<i>against America's military
intervention into Iraq.</i>

01:10:59.595 --> 01:11:02.530
<i>From US cities to Europe and
the Middle East...</i>

01:11:02.532 --> 01:11:05.600
<i>demonstrators have taken to the
streets in opposition...</i>

01:11:05.602 --> 01:11:08.805
<i>to the United States'
threat to invade Iraq.</i>

01:11:16.446 --> 01:11:18.478
Mr. Strobel, Mr. Landay,
how do you do?

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.713
- Hello.
- I'm Entifadh Qanbar.

01:11:19.715 --> 01:11:21.517
- Hi.
- Now, please, follow me.

01:11:22.919 --> 01:11:24.518
Who's this dude?

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:29.123
Guy who used to deliver pizzas.
I'm not kidding.

01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:30.892
Minister Chalabi,
Mr. Jonathan Landay...

01:11:30.894 --> 01:11:34.628
and Warren Strobel from Knight
Ridder News.

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:36.864
Gentlemen, welcome.

01:11:36.866 --> 01:11:40.735
Hey. Thank you for finally
agreeing to meet with us.

01:11:40.737 --> 01:11:43.204
I've been very busy.

01:11:43.206 --> 01:11:45.606
Talking to our competitors.

01:11:45.608 --> 01:11:47.909
I speak with whomever wishes
to speak with me.

01:11:47.911 --> 01:11:50.210
After all, I have nothing
to hide...

01:11:50.212 --> 01:11:54.182
which is more than I can say
for Saddam.

01:11:54.184 --> 01:11:55.950
Okay, well, since you brought
him up...

01:11:55.952 --> 01:11:57.651
I thought we might talk
about what...

01:11:57.653 --> 01:11:59.719
you know about his weapons
and how he might be hiding them.

01:11:59.721 --> 01:12:05.125
He has WMD and he's hiding them,
that I know.

01:12:05.127 --> 01:12:07.695
Right, and you know that how?

01:12:07.697 --> 01:12:10.897
I know everything that's
happening in my country.

01:12:10.899 --> 01:12:14.168
Even though Iraq hasn't been
your country for over a decade?

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:19.073
I may be an exile, but I'm still
an Iraqi.

01:12:19.075 --> 01:12:21.542
Well, I think the point my
colleague is trying to make...

01:12:21.544 --> 01:12:24.678
is how would you, an enemy
of Saddam, in exile...

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.949
have access to such valuable
information?

01:12:27.951 --> 01:12:29.984
I maintain close
relationships...

01:12:29.986 --> 01:12:32.152
with dissident intelligence
sources.

01:12:32.154 --> 01:12:33.820
Is there a way we can
verify that?

01:12:33.822 --> 01:12:35.589
No.

01:12:35.591 --> 01:12:37.525
See, that's kind of a problem
for us...

01:12:37.527 --> 01:12:39.060
because we can't write a story...

01:12:39.062 --> 01:12:44.832
I want what America wants,
a free and democratic Iraq.

01:12:44.834 --> 01:12:46.801
With you as its leader?

01:12:46.803 --> 01:12:50.504
If the people of Iraq wish
for me to return, yes.

01:12:50.506 --> 01:12:54.508
I want the opportunity to help
rebuild my country...

01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:57.011
the way Mandela did
in South Africa.

01:12:57.013 --> 01:13:01.548
But Mandela didn't ask the U.S.
to invade his country.

01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:04.651
He wasn't fighting terrorists.

01:13:04.653 --> 01:13:06.887
With all due respect, that's
where the red flags...

01:13:06.889 --> 01:13:08.722
start to go up for us.

01:13:08.724 --> 01:13:11.225
Are you implying that I've
created a false narrative...

01:13:11.227 --> 01:13:12.994
for my own pursuits?

01:13:12.996 --> 01:13:15.295
Is there another reason why
you'd create a false narrative?

01:13:15.297 --> 01:13:18.132
I don't lie!

01:13:18.134 --> 01:13:20.968
Saddam Hussein has mobile
chemical...

01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:22.969
and biological weapons labs.

01:13:22.971 --> 01:13:27.208
He has a nuclear program.
He has ties to terrorists.

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:30.744
And if you don't believe me,
just ask the many other...

01:13:30.746 --> 01:13:32.646
defectors and hear
what they say.

01:13:32.648 --> 01:13:34.682
They will all tell
you the same thing.

01:13:34.684 --> 01:13:39.656
Don't they all get their
information from you?

01:13:43.091 --> 01:13:46.093
If you were wondering why
it took so long for me...

01:13:46.095 --> 01:13:51.865
to meet with you, it's this
smug attitude.

01:13:51.867 --> 01:13:55.735
You have no intention of
reporting anything I've said.

01:13:55.737 --> 01:13:58.204
Do you want us to just be your
cheerleaders?

01:13:58.206 --> 01:13:59.707
All right, I think we
should go.

01:13:59.709 --> 01:14:03.143
Thank you for your time.

01:14:03.145 --> 01:14:07.748
Now I see why no one reads
anything you write.

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:11.319
I am an advocate for the removal
of a vicious dictator...

01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:16.057
for a free Iraq, an Iraq that
will one day be a close ally...

01:14:16.059 --> 01:14:20.828
to your country, to Israel, and
to all of the Western world.

01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:24.164
And exactly how will this happen
after Saddam Hussein is gone?

01:14:24.166 --> 01:14:25.865
All right, come on, Landay.

01:14:25.867 --> 01:14:27.701
No, no, no, he says the world
will be better off...

01:14:27.703 --> 01:14:29.203
but he doesn't say how.

01:14:29.205 --> 01:14:31.705
How would the removal
of Saddam Hussein...

01:14:31.707 --> 01:14:34.741
not plunge Iraq into a bloody
civil war?

01:14:34.743 --> 01:14:36.677
Tell us something that makes
sense...

01:14:36.679 --> 01:14:41.915
anything that makes sense, and
we'll write that story today.

01:14:41.917 --> 01:14:43.183
You can't!

01:14:43.185 --> 01:14:45.785
Because you have no
idea what happens next.

01:14:45.787 --> 01:14:47.821
- And neither does anyone else.
- John. John!

01:14:47.823 --> 01:14:50.758
I would rather go back and write
for my high school paper...

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.093
than to be used by you...

01:14:52.095 --> 01:14:55.161
to sell the American public
your bullshit.

01:14:55.163 --> 01:14:56.132
All right.

01:15:00.303 --> 01:15:04.204
By the way, it's Knight <i>Ridder.</i>

01:15:04.206 --> 01:15:06.007
<i>Secretary of State Colin Powell
will make the case...</i>

01:15:06.009 --> 01:15:09.310
<i>against Iraq in a nationally
televised address...</i>

01:15:09.312 --> 01:15:11.779
<i>to the UN Security Council.</i>

01:15:11.781 --> 01:15:13.780
Looks like they're bringing
in the closer.

01:15:13.782 --> 01:15:15.249
<i>Mr. Secretary,
are you confident...</i>

01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:16.851
<i>you will make your case, sir?</i>

01:15:16.853 --> 01:15:18.319
You'll see.

01:15:18.321 --> 01:15:20.154
What the hell game have we've
been playing?

01:15:20.156 --> 01:15:22.292
All we did is piss into the
wind.

01:15:24.426 --> 01:15:27.427
We did our jobs.

01:15:27.429 --> 01:15:30.830
I should never have become
a reporter.

01:15:30.832 --> 01:15:33.870
Damn that Woodward and
Bernstein.

01:15:36.339 --> 01:15:39.073
They took down a president
whose biggest crime...

01:15:39.075 --> 01:15:42.910
was trying to cover up some
dirty political tricks.

01:15:42.912 --> 01:15:45.279
This president's about to do the
worst thing any president...

01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:47.718
could do and he'll probably
get re-elected.

01:15:49.852 --> 01:15:51.787
To the democratic experiment.

01:15:55.257 --> 01:15:56.891
<i>Thank you, Mr. President.</i>

01:15:56.893 --> 01:15:59.192
<i>My colleagues, every statement
I make today...</i>

01:15:59.194 --> 01:16:03.931
<i>is backed up by sources,
solid sources.</i>

01:16:03.933 --> 01:16:07.334
<i>The gravity of this moment is
matched by the gravity...</i>

01:16:07.336 --> 01:16:10.337
<i>of the threat that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction...</i>

01:16:10.339 --> 01:16:11.905
<i>pose to the world.</i>

01:16:11.907 --> 01:16:15.709
It was a set up, the whole damn
thing was a set up.

01:16:15.711 --> 01:16:18.244
Tenet sent Powell a stack
of files this high...

01:16:18.246 --> 01:16:19.413
that supported the invasion.

01:16:19.415 --> 01:16:21.414
<i>Saddam Hussein is determined...</i>

01:16:21.416 --> 01:16:23.851
<i>to get his hands
on a nuclear bomb.</i>

01:16:23.853 --> 01:16:25.218
Cheney sent Scooter Libby...

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.887
to push three main arguments
in those files.

01:16:27.889 --> 01:16:29.423
One: Saddam's human rights
abuses...

01:16:29.425 --> 01:16:30.990
which everybody knew about.

01:16:30.992 --> 01:16:32.860
Two: his links to al Qaeda,
which Powell...

01:16:32.862 --> 01:16:34.762
of course, threw right
in the trash.

01:16:34.764 --> 01:16:39.400
And the third focused
on Iraq's WMD.

01:16:39.402 --> 01:16:41.869
<i>Leaving Saddam Hussein in
possession of weapons...</i>

01:16:41.871 --> 01:16:44.204
<i>of mass destruction for a few
more months or years...</i>

01:16:44.206 --> 01:16:48.241
<i>is not an option, not in a
post-September 11th world.</i>

01:16:48.243 --> 01:16:52.178
Over a four-day period, Powell
made every single CIA officer...

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.415
defend every so-called piece
of evidence in those files.

01:16:55.417 --> 01:16:57.250
He threw out 80% of them.

01:16:57.252 --> 01:16:59.018
At the end of the four days...

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.254
Powell looked Tenet right
in the eye and said...

01:17:01.256 --> 01:17:06.192
"George, can we stand
by every word of this?"

01:17:06.194 --> 01:17:13.066
And Tenet said, "Everything in
there is gold, I promise you."

01:17:13.068 --> 01:17:15.302
To which Powell replied, "Well,
that's good, George.

01:17:15.304 --> 01:17:17.271
"I'm glad you feel that way,
'cause you're going to be...

01:17:17.273 --> 01:17:20.307
"sitting right behind me when
I present this to the world."

01:17:20.309 --> 01:17:24.410
<i>We must not fail in our duty
and our responsibility...</i>

01:17:24.412 --> 01:17:26.379
<i>to the citizens of the
countries...</i>

01:17:26.381 --> 01:17:29.450
<i>that are represented
by this body.</i>

01:17:29.452 --> 01:17:32.285
Colin took one for the team.

01:17:32.287 --> 01:17:34.320
Always the good soldier.

01:17:34.322 --> 01:17:36.323
<i>Has the Iraqi regime fully...</i>

01:17:36.325 --> 01:17:39.927
<i>and unconditionally disarmed?</i>

01:17:39.929 --> 01:17:43.097
<i>The only acceptable outcome is
the one already defined...</i>

01:17:43.099 --> 01:17:45.865
<i>by a unanimous vote of the
Security Council.</i>

01:17:45.867 --> 01:17:49.003
<i>Total disarmament.</i>

01:17:49.005 --> 01:17:51.204
<i>Great Britain, Spain and the
United States have introduced..</i>

01:17:51.206 --> 01:17:54.508
<i>a new resolution stating that
Iraq has failed to meet...</i>

01:17:54.510 --> 01:18:01.382
<i>the requirements
of Resolution 1441.</i>

01:18:01.384 --> 01:18:05.319
<i>This is a fact, it cannot
be denied.</i>

01:18:05.321 --> 01:18:06.553
<i>And what harm
would it do to give...</i>

01:18:06.555 --> 01:18:08.489
<i>Saddam a final ultimatum?</i>

01:18:08.491 --> 01:18:11.392
<i>A two or three day deadline
to disarm or face force?</i>

01:18:11.394 --> 01:18:13.994
<i>September the 11th changed
the strategic thinking...</i>

01:18:13.996 --> 01:18:16.230
<i>at least as far as I was
concerned...</i>

01:18:16.232 --> 01:18:18.865
<i>for how to protect our country.</i>

01:18:18.867 --> 01:18:24.038
<i>My job is to protect the
American people.</i>

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.040
<i>Used to be that we could think
that you could contain...</i>

01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:28.909
<i>a person like Saddam Hussein...</i>

01:18:28.911 --> 01:18:31.611
<i>that oceans would protect us
from his type of terror.</i>

01:18:33.515 --> 01:18:35.516
<i>September the 11th should say
to the American people...</i>

01:18:35.518 --> 01:18:37.418
Hello?

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:39.352
You need to pack your bags.

01:18:39.354 --> 01:18:42.589
Right.

01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:45.092
<i>In the hands of a terrorist
organization...</i>

01:18:45.094 --> 01:18:48.428
<i>could be deployed here at home.</i>

01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:52.432
<i>King, John King. This is a
scripted...</i>

01:18:52.434 --> 01:18:54.267
<i>Thank you, Mr. President.</i>

01:18:54.269 --> 01:18:56.603
<i>Sir, how would you answer your
critics who say that they...</i>

01:18:56.605 --> 01:18:58.338
<i>They think this is somehow
personal?</i>

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.374
<i>As Senator Kennedy put it
tonight...</i>

01:19:00.376 --> 01:19:02.877
<i>he said your fixation
with Saddam Hussein...</i>

01:19:02.879 --> 01:19:05.079
<i>is making the world a more
dangerous place.</i>

01:19:05.081 --> 01:19:07.114
<i>And as you prepare the American
people for the possibility...</i>

01:19:07.116 --> 01:19:09.316
<i>of military conflict, could you
share with us...</i>

01:19:09.318 --> 01:19:11.451
<i>any of the scenarios your
advisors have shared...</i>

01:19:11.453 --> 01:19:15.222
<i>with you about worst-case
scenarios?</i>

01:19:15.224 --> 01:19:21.464
You make sure the... this country
knows what's going on out there.

01:19:22.598 --> 01:19:25.031
- Yeah?
- I will.

01:19:25.033 --> 01:19:29.335
<i>I swore to protect and defend
the Constitution.</i>

01:19:29.337 --> 01:19:31.371
<i>He has weapons of mass
destruction...</i>

01:19:31.373 --> 01:19:34.475
<i>and he has used weapons
of mass destruction.</i>

01:19:34.477 --> 01:19:36.176
<i>He has trained and financed...</i>

01:19:36.178 --> 01:19:38.646
<i>al Qaeda-type organizations
before.</i>

01:19:38.648 --> 01:19:42.449
<i>I take the threat seriously,
and I'll deal with the threat.</i>

01:19:42.451 --> 01:19:45.319
<i>I hope it can be done
peacefully.</i>

01:19:45.321 --> 01:19:48.422
<i>They hate what we stand for.</i>

01:19:48.424 --> 01:19:50.227
<i>We love freedom, and we're
not changing.</i>

01:19:52.127 --> 01:19:54.093
<i>Mr. President,
millions of Americans can...</i>

01:19:54.095 --> 01:19:57.097
<i>recall a time when leaders from
both parties set this country..</i>

01:19:57.099 --> 01:19:59.333
<i>on a mission of regime change
in Vietnam.</i>

01:19:59.335 --> 01:20:01.968
<i>50,000 Americans died.</i>

01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:04.938
<i>The regime is still there in
Hanoi and it hasn't harmed...</i>

01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.606
<i>or threatened a single American
in 30 years...</i>

01:20:06.608 --> 01:20:08.409
<i>since the war ended.</i>

01:20:08.411 --> 01:20:11.177
<i>What can you say tonight, sir,
to the sons and daughters...</i>

01:20:11.179 --> 01:20:14.647
<i>of the Americans who served in
Vietnam to assure them that...</i>

01:20:14.649 --> 01:20:18.418
<i>you will not lead this country
down a similar path in Iraq?</i>

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:21.387
<i>That's a great question.</i>

01:20:21.389 --> 01:20:24.191
<i>No doubt, there's risks with
any military operation.</i>

01:20:24.193 --> 01:20:26.026
<i>I know that.</i>

01:20:26.028 --> 01:20:28.462
It's a good thing he can draw
on all that experience he got...

01:20:28.464 --> 01:20:30.664
while not serving in the
National Guard.

01:20:30.666 --> 01:20:34.034
<i>But it's very clear what we
intend to do.</i>

01:20:34.036 --> 01:20:36.139
<i>And our mission won't change.</i>

01:20:38.674 --> 01:20:43.343
<i>It could last, you know, six
days, six weeks...</i>

01:20:43.345 --> 01:20:47.114
<i>I doubt six months.</i>

01:20:47.116 --> 01:20:48.649
<i>There's a lot of money to pay
for this...</i>

01:20:48.651 --> 01:20:50.616
<i>that doesn't have to be
U.S. taxpayer money.</i>

01:20:50.618 --> 01:20:53.152
<i>We're dealing with a country
that can really finance...</i>

01:20:53.154 --> 01:20:56.022
<i>its own reconstruction,
and relatively soon.</i>

01:20:56.024 --> 01:20:58.592
<i>There will always be some
uncertainty...</i>

01:20:58.594 --> 01:21:01.328
<i>about how quickly he can
acquire nuclear weapons...</i>

01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:04.263
<i>but we don't want the smoking
gun to be a mushroom cloud.</i>

01:21:04.265 --> 01:21:06.165
<i>Do you think the
America people...</i>

01:21:06.167 --> 01:21:09.636
<i>are prepared for a long,
costly, and bloody battle...</i>

01:21:09.638 --> 01:21:12.106
<i>with significant American
casualties?</i>

01:21:12.108 --> 01:21:14.173
<i>I don't think it's likely
to unfold that way, Tim...</i>

01:21:14.175 --> 01:21:16.276
<i>because I really do believe we
will be greeted as liberators.</i>

01:21:16.278 --> 01:21:19.213
<i>Six weeks after the
war had begun, the President...</i>

01:21:19.215 --> 01:21:21.481
<i>is set to deliver a very
carefully worded speech...</i>

01:21:21.483 --> 01:21:24.084
<i>on a carrier in the Pacific.</i>

01:21:24.086 --> 01:21:27.620
<i>My fellow Americans,
major combat operations...</i>

01:21:27.622 --> 01:21:29.556
<i>in Iraq have ended.</i>

01:21:29.558 --> 01:21:32.659
<i>In the battle of Iraq,
the United States...</i>

01:21:32.661 --> 01:21:35.498
<i>and our allies have prevailed.</i>

01:22:17.572 --> 01:22:19.575
I want to go down there.

01:22:37.492 --> 01:22:40.496
They were the first to die.

01:22:45.233 --> 01:22:47.370
Were you there?

01:22:50.706 --> 01:22:52.108
Thank you.

01:22:57.545 --> 01:22:59.281
Thank you, son.

01:24:04.779 --> 01:24:06.579
<i>Jonathan, how did it feel,
therefore...</i>

01:24:06.581 --> 01:24:10.350
<i>to be the lone holdouts in this
pursuit of truth and fact?</i>

01:24:10.352 --> 01:24:12.718
<i>It was very lonely and what
made it actually one...</i>

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.288
<i>of the ironies is...</i>

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:15.955
<i>that every time we would write
something...</i>

01:24:15.957 --> 01:24:19.325
<i>the White House would say
nothing, because we realized...</i>

01:24:19.327 --> 01:24:21.561
<i>after a while that that would
have been the best...</i>

01:24:21.563 --> 01:24:24.530
<i>advertising for our stories we
could have possibly asked for.</i>

01:24:24.532 --> 01:24:25.632
<i>There's a problem with
journalism...</i>

01:24:25.634 --> 01:24:27.433
<i>in Washington, which is access.</i>

01:24:27.435 --> 01:24:29.302
<i>And The New York Times and
others had access to the top...</i>

01:24:29.304 --> 01:24:30.736
<i>officials who were spinning
this line.</i>

01:24:30.738 --> 01:24:32.371
<i>We talked to those people,
as well...</i>

01:24:32.373 --> 01:24:33.640
<i>but most of our reporting,
Christiane...</i>

01:24:33.642 --> 01:24:35.642
<i>was with intelligence,
military...</i>

01:24:35.644 --> 01:24:36.810
<i>and diplomatic mid-level...</i>

01:24:36.812 --> 01:24:38.811
- <i>Lower level?</i>
- <i>Lower level.</i>

01:24:38.813 --> 01:24:40.780
<i>The types journalists don't
normally talk to or go after.</i>

01:24:40.782 --> 01:24:42.783
<i>Can I just give a little
credit, also, to the man...</i>

01:24:42.785 --> 01:24:44.718
<i>who was our boss at the time,
John Walcott.</i>

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.887
<i>Higher levels of
civilization...</i>

01:24:46.889 --> 01:24:49.455
<i>must depend even more
heavily...</i>

01:24:49.457 --> 01:24:52.926
<i>on a conscientious respect for
the importance of honesty...</i>

01:24:52.928 --> 01:24:56.829
<i>and clarity in reporting the
facts and out of stubborn...</i>

01:24:56.831 --> 01:25:02.468
<i>concern for accuracy in
determining what the facts are.</i>

01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:07.240
<i>We need to find some way
to cover the world so that...</i>

01:25:07.242 --> 01:25:09.543
<i>we know what's happening
out there...</i>

01:25:09.545 --> 01:25:11.311
<i>that we know the truth
about it...</i>

01:25:11.313 --> 01:25:15.882
<i>so we can avoid mistakes...</i>

01:25:15.884 --> 01:25:18.884
<i>mistakes like Iraq.</i>

01:25:18.886 --> 01:25:21.021
<i>The intelligence was
what it was.</i>

01:25:21.023 --> 01:25:22.888
<i>You know, people like me
couldn't make it up.</i>

01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:24.591
<i>The intelligence
wasn't what it was...</i>

01:25:24.593 --> 01:25:26.560
<i>and not everybody got it wrong.</i>

01:25:26.562 --> 01:25:29.431
<i>Almost everybody did,
except for Knight Ridder.</i>
