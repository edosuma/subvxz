Hi, Tony.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.534
Hi, Latka.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.534
How you doing?

01:09.567 --> 01:11.801
Oh... ( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

01:11.834 --> 01:14.200
Well, I got a little problem.

01:14.234 --> 01:16.200
Oh...

01:16.234 --> 01:17.901
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

01:19.601 --> 01:21.868
Well, there's
this girl...

01:21.901 --> 01:25.200
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

01:25.234 --> 01:27.934
Well, I met her
a couple of weeks ago.

01:27.968 --> 01:29.701
She's a cab driver, too.

01:29.734 --> 01:31.434
Works out of the Bronx.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.167
We were both
in the line at Kennedy

01:33.200 --> 01:35.868
and we got to talking
and we went for breakfast...

01:35.901 --> 01:38.567
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

01:38.601 --> 01:40.634
Right-- one thing
led to another.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.534
So, I've been seeing her
for a couple of weeks

01:43.567 --> 01:45.934
and I'm not so sure I want
to go on seeing her.

01:45.968 --> 01:47.000
( <i>asks question</i> )

01:47.033 --> 01:48.534
Can I just tell her?

01:48.567 --> 01:50.167
I mean, I think she likes me.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.501
I don't want to hurt the girl.

01:52.534 --> 01:58.834
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

01:58.868 --> 02:00.934
You're right, the longer I wait

02:00.968 --> 02:03.467
the tougher it's
going to get, but...

02:03.501 --> 02:05.968
You're right. I just got
to take care of it today.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.567
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

02:10.601 --> 02:12.901
I will, Latka,
I will, all right.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.200
Hey, Latka, tell me something.

02:16.234 --> 02:18.501
How come I never understand
a single word you say,

02:18.534 --> 02:20.100
yet I always know
what you're talking about?

02:20.133 --> 02:21.367
Oh...

02:21.400 --> 02:28.801
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

02:28.834 --> 02:30.234
Uh... uh...

02:30.267 --> 02:34.067
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

02:34.100 --> 02:36.834
Yeah, that must be it.

02:42.601 --> 02:43.734
Hey, Alex.

02:43.767 --> 02:45.901
Louie, I just had
an accident in 723.

02:45.934 --> 02:47.734
What? Are you
okay, man?

02:47.767 --> 02:49.601
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

02:49.634 --> 02:50.968
One thing at a time.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.167
Where's the cab?

02:52.200 --> 02:54.534
It's upstairs.

02:54.567 --> 02:57.200
Latka, go on up and
check out the damage.

02:57.234 --> 02:58.868
I want a complete report.

02:58.901 --> 02:59.934
Was anybody hurt?

02:59.968 --> 03:01.000
No, no.
It's no big deal.

03:01.033 --> 03:02.033
I just dented my fender

03:02.067 --> 03:03.767
and knocked in the side
of a parked car.

03:03.801 --> 03:05.434
It shouldn't be more
than $700-800.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.334
A parked car?

03:08.367 --> 03:09.701
Yeah.

03:09.734 --> 03:14.000
Alex Rieger, 180,000 miles
without an accident,

03:14.033 --> 03:18.601
voted "New York Cabbie
of the Month" August 1977,

03:18.634 --> 03:21.200
just rams into
a parked car?

03:21.234 --> 03:23.300
Louie, I just couldn't help it!

03:23.334 --> 03:24.701
I was going
down 72nd street

03:24.734 --> 03:26.634
and as I was approaching
Third Avenue,

03:26.667 --> 03:28.534
this dog runs out
in front of my cab.

03:28.567 --> 03:29.567
Either I hit the dog

03:29.601 --> 03:31.100
or swerve and
hit this Cordoba

03:31.133 --> 03:32.267
that was parked there.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.667
Wait a minute.

03:33.701 --> 03:37.767
You mean, you had a choice
of running over some mutt

03:37.801 --> 03:39.968
and ramming into a Cordoba?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.434
A Chrysler Cordoba
with Corinthian leather?

03:43.467 --> 03:45.467
And you chose...

03:45.501 --> 03:47.534
You made a conscious choice

03:47.567 --> 03:49.033
to hit the Cordoba?

03:49.067 --> 03:51.400
Where are your values, Rieger?

03:52.701 --> 03:54.934
Hey, Louie, why don't you
just lay off him, all right?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.567
Yeah, he feels
bad enough.

03:56.601 --> 03:58.767
( <i>growls</i> )

03:58.801 --> 04:00.334
Were there
any witnesses?

04:00.367 --> 04:01.501
No.

04:01.534 --> 04:03.000
What about the owner
of the parked car?

04:03.033 --> 04:04.868
He wasn't there.
I left a note
on his windshield.

04:04.901 --> 04:09.133
Ooh, you left a note
on his windshield.

04:09.167 --> 04:09.767
Yeah.

04:09.801 --> 04:11.067
Oh, good thinking, Rieger.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.133
Otherwise, he might not know
where to reach us

04:13.167 --> 04:15.534
and we couldn't pay
for the damages.

04:15.567 --> 04:16.767
Smart, smart.

04:16.801 --> 04:18.200
Louie, you have
to leave a note.

04:18.233 --> 04:19.267
It's the law.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.200
Well, sure it's the law.

04:21.233 --> 04:24.667
It's also the law you
can't spit in public.

04:24.701 --> 04:28.334
You have such an elegant way of
making a point, you know that?

04:28.367 --> 04:29.901
Come on, let's get breakfast.

04:29.934 --> 04:33.000
$700 damage just to
avoid hitting a dog.

04:33.033 --> 04:34.834
I mean, if you'd
have swerved

04:34.868 --> 04:36.701
to avoid hitting
an old lady,

04:36.734 --> 04:38.033
I could understand.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.667
I'm not saying
I'd agree,

04:39.701 --> 04:41.200
but I could understand.

04:41.234 --> 04:43.267
But a dog.

04:44.267 --> 04:45.934
( <i>growls</i> )

04:53.767 --> 04:55.200
You know, that was
my first accident

04:55.234 --> 04:57.334
in almost six years
of driving a cab.

04:57.367 --> 05:01.033
Well, look at it this way--
you're not a virgin anymore.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.968
Yeah, I lost my bumper.

05:06.701 --> 05:07.667
Hey, Tony,
over here.

05:07.701 --> 05:08.667
Hi, Tony.

05:08.701 --> 05:09.667
Hi, Tony.

05:09.701 --> 05:11.000
Hey, I can only sit down
for a minute.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.367
I'm meeting Denise
here for breakfast.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.467
JOHN:
Hey, you want
some coffee?

05:13.501 --> 05:14.601
Yeah, please.

05:15.634 --> 05:18.267
Hey, Bobby,
maybe you can help me.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.367
I got to tell Denise I don't
want to see her anymore.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.567
I don't know how to do it
without hurting her.

05:21.601 --> 05:22.868
Ooh...

05:22.901 --> 05:24.834
That kind of thing's
never easy to do.

05:24.868 --> 05:26.767
I tell you what.
This is what you do.

05:26.801 --> 05:28.934
You put all the blame
on yourself, right?

05:28.968 --> 05:31.167
You tell her that you're
not worthy of her, you know,

05:31.200 --> 05:32.167
that she can do better.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.133
Nah, she'd
never buy that.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.434
I've been trying

05:35.467 --> 05:38.534
to figure out a way
to do this all week.

05:38.567 --> 05:40.701
Anybody got
any suggestions?

05:40.734 --> 05:42.367
Hey, Elaine, what
do guys usually do

05:42.400 --> 05:43.901
when they want
to get rid of you?

05:43.934 --> 05:46.200
Thanks a lot.

05:46.234 --> 05:48.067
You know what
I mean, Elaine.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.534
Tony, just be honest.

05:49.567 --> 05:52.367
Just tell her how you feel
and then take your lumps.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.834
Yeah, I guess you're right.

05:53.868 --> 05:55.734
Hey, Alex, you ever
have to break up

05:55.767 --> 05:57.400
with a woman
you were close to?

05:57.434 --> 06:00.000
Oh, what am I saying.
He was married.

06:00.033 --> 06:01.200
I mean, do you remember

06:01.234 --> 06:02.734
what you said to your wife
to break up with her?

06:02.767 --> 06:04.300
Yeah, I remember what I said.

06:04.334 --> 06:07.334
I said, "Why is that man
wearing my pajamas?"

06:10.033 --> 06:11.167
DENISE:
Tony?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.267
Hi, Denise.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.400
Hi, baby.

06:13.434 --> 06:14.834
Let's sit over there.

06:14.868 --> 06:17.501
Aren't you going
to introduce me to your friends?

06:17.534 --> 06:19.868
There doesn't seem
to be much point.

06:21.033 --> 06:22.300
Okay.

06:23.901 --> 06:27.200
Denise, this is Elaine,
Alex, Bobby and John.

06:27.234 --> 06:28.767
Hi, how are you?

06:31.367 --> 06:32.634
Well, we were just leaving.

06:34.567 --> 06:35.901
Have a nice
breakfast.

06:42.234 --> 06:44.067
It was nice
knowing you.

06:47.567 --> 06:48.868
You want some?

06:48.901 --> 06:50.033
No, thanks.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.200
Sure?

06:52.234 --> 06:53.601
Help you stay awake,

06:53.634 --> 06:56.834
take a few pounds off
or do the 100 in 9.7.

06:56.868 --> 06:59.734
You know I don't do
that kind of junk.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.100
So how you doing, honey?

07:01.133 --> 07:02.267
I'm okay.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.367
Denise, I got
something to say.

07:06.701 --> 07:08.200
I wish there was a...

07:08.234 --> 07:11.601
a smarter way to
lead up to this.

07:11.634 --> 07:13.901
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.701
Well...

07:22.868 --> 07:25.367
There might have been
some smarter ways

07:25.400 --> 07:27.200
of leading up
to that, Tony.

07:27.234 --> 07:29.901
I mean, some guys
would have tried

07:29.934 --> 07:33.033
to soften me up with
a lot of flattery.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.634
Or they might
have made up

07:34.667 --> 07:36.567
some long,
involved story.

07:38.133 --> 07:39.400
Not you.

07:40.567 --> 07:45.067
You just came
right out with it.

07:46.234 --> 07:49.234
I can't say you weren't
straight with me.

07:49.267 --> 07:52.868
I guess that's what I've
always liked about you.

07:52.901 --> 07:54.200
Thanks.

07:54.234 --> 07:57.901
That's also why I'm
never gonna let you go.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.033
( <i>continues singing</i>
<i>in native language</i> )

08:16.868 --> 08:18.534
Hey, Rieger.

08:19.868 --> 08:21.901
You got to help me
so I can fill out

08:21.934 --> 08:23.501
this property
damage report.

08:23.534 --> 08:25.300
Oh, not the box
again, Louie.

08:25.334 --> 08:26.501
Come on over here.

08:26.534 --> 08:27.667
What's he doing?

08:27.701 --> 08:29.968
They're going to
reenact the accident.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.934
It's company policy--
it's fun.

08:35.033 --> 08:36.366
Hold the box here.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.033
Okay
Latka watch?

08:38.067 --> 08:40.366
Here, sit down.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.534
All right.

08:41.567 --> 08:43.167
Now, here's
72nd Street

08:43.200 --> 08:45.868
where it intersects
with Third Avenue.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.033
That's right.

08:47.067 --> 08:49.367
Now, we got a
stoplight here.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.534
Right.

08:50.567 --> 08:51.734
All right.

08:52.734 --> 08:55.033
Okay, what color
was the light?

08:55.067 --> 08:56.501
The light
was green.

08:57.534 --> 08:58.601
( <i>stoplight dings</i> )

08:58.634 --> 08:59.701
All right.

08:59.734 --> 09:00.701
It's green.

09:00.734 --> 09:02.033
All right.

09:02.067 --> 09:05.133
Now, you were
traveling west
on 72nd street?

09:05.167 --> 09:06.434
Right.

09:06.467 --> 09:08.634
Now, were there people
in the streets?

09:08.667 --> 09:10.868
Yeah, there were a few,
it was early in the morning.

09:10.901 --> 09:13.367
Now, where'd the
dog come from?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.167
About over here.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.200
All right.

09:18.367 --> 09:19.801
I don't have a dog.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.501
What's that
over there?

09:21.534 --> 09:22.868
It's not a dog.

09:24.534 --> 09:26.501
It's a gun,
it's a gun.

09:26.534 --> 09:28.167
Here, here.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.934
No cockroaches,
Latka.

09:29.968 --> 09:32.534
Get that cockroach
out of there.

09:35.968 --> 09:38.234
Sorry to bother you.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.133
All right, I got a baby.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.400
We'll use the baby for the dog.

09:45.434 --> 09:47.367
Okay.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.100
I'm traveling
in this direction

09:49.133 --> 09:50.634
at about 30 miles an hour.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.300
I notice the light is green,

09:52.334 --> 09:54.534
so I start to speed up
so I can make it

09:54.567 --> 09:56.200
and just then, all of a sudden,

09:56.234 --> 09:58.534
this dog runs out
in the middle of the road,

09:58.567 --> 10:02.734
so I swerve to my right and I
hit this parked car right here.

10:02.767 --> 10:06.267
My right fender hits the door
on the driver's side.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.367
I carom off and I come
to a stop about there.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.133
And the dog runs off,
I don't know, somewhere.

10:13.167 --> 10:15.200
And that was it.

10:15.234 --> 10:16.934
Phew!

10:20.367 --> 10:22.534
Thank you very much.

10:22.567 --> 10:23.534

How'd it go with Denise
this morning?

10:26.434 --> 10:27.501
JOHN:
Yeah, how'd it go?

10:27.534 --> 10:29.567
Well, it didn't go exactly
like I thought it would.

10:29.601 --> 10:30.567
Well, you told her

10:30.601 --> 10:32.200
you wanted to break
up with her, didn't you?

10:32.234 --> 10:33.634
Yeah, I told her.
Just like you said--

10:33.667 --> 10:34.634
straight and honest.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.167
But she said she wasn't
going to let me go.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.734
What does that mean?
She wasn't going to let you go?

10:38.767 --> 10:39.934
She didn't believe me.

10:39.968 --> 10:42.567
She kept telling me we were
really good for each other.

10:42.601 --> 10:45.000
and that whatever I was
feeling now, I'd get over.

10:45.033 --> 10:47.467
I kept telling her, "I'm
not going to get over it."

10:47.501 --> 10:49.234
But I couldn't convince her.

10:49.267 --> 10:51.567
She kept asking me to come
back to her room with her.

10:51.601 --> 10:54.400
Oh. But you didn't
go, did you?

10:54.434 --> 10:56.133
Yeah, I mean,
it was the toughest scene

10:56.167 --> 10:57.200
I've ever been through.

10:57.234 --> 10:58.601
Right there in the restaurant,

10:58.634 --> 11:00.200
she started kissing me
on the neck,

11:00.234 --> 11:03.167
stuff like that--
nibbling on my fingers.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.100
It wasn't easy to say no.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.200
Did you ever see
<i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

11:06.234 --> 11:07.200
Yeah.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.200
What's that got to do with it?

11:08.234 --> 11:11.234
Well, remember
the Wicked Witch of the West?

11:11.267 --> 11:13.167
The one with the green face

11:13.200 --> 11:16.534
and the big nose
and that ugly wart on her chin?

11:16.567 --> 11:17.667
Yeah.

11:17.701 --> 11:19.534
Well, I just closed my eyes

11:19.567 --> 11:23.601
and tried to pretend it was her
doing all that stuff to me.

11:23.634 --> 11:26.968
Pretended it was that ugly witch
sucking my fingers.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.400
I pretended it was that ugly
witch blowing in my ear.

11:30.434 --> 11:34.167
And I pretended it was that ugly
witch with her hand on my knee.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.234
And then...

11:35.267 --> 11:36.734
And then what?

11:36.767 --> 11:41.033
I got to thinking-- who cares
how ugly the witch is?

11:45.133 --> 11:47.367
Tony, you mean
you went with her?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.767
No, Elaine, I didn't.

11:48.801 --> 11:52.267
I realized, you know, if I did,
I'd never end this relationship.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.467
From somewhere,
I don't know where,

11:54.501 --> 11:56.667
but I got the strength
to say no.

11:56.701 --> 11:57.667
What did Denise do?

11:57.701 --> 11:59.501
Well, I really must have
surprised her.

11:59.534 --> 12:01.367
She didn't think
I had it in me either.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.534
She just got up
and left the restaurant.

12:03.567 --> 12:05.100
I guess she finally realized

12:05.133 --> 12:07.834
that when I said it was over,
I meant it was over.

12:07.868 --> 12:10.467
Hey, Tony, you
did real good, man.

12:10.501 --> 12:11.701
Yeah, I'll say.

12:11.734 --> 12:13.200
It was the only way.

12:13.234 --> 12:14.767
TONY:
And I'll tell you something,
it wasn't easy.

12:14.801 --> 12:18.200
All right, all right,
we got a lot of cabs here.

12:18.234 --> 12:21.601
Hey, Nardo, you got 708.

12:21.634 --> 12:23.868
Wheeler, 204.

12:23.901 --> 12:25.200
All right.

12:25.234 --> 12:27.701
Rieger, 509.

12:27.734 --> 12:31.400
Burns, 311, Burns.

12:31.434 --> 12:33.067
Banta, 682.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.067
All right.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.667
Hey, Latka,
get 246 ready.

12:35.701 --> 12:37.901
I'm giving it
to the new driver.

12:37.934 --> 12:39.400
What new driver?

12:39.434 --> 12:40.667
That one.

12:40.701 --> 12:42.067
Hi, Tony.

12:42.100 --> 12:45.467
Geela, you got 916.

12:45.501 --> 12:49.467
Rutherford, you got...

13:00.901 --> 13:02.734
Here you go, Louie.

13:05.767 --> 13:08.200
You booked $19 today?

13:08.234 --> 13:10.234
A one and a nine?

13:10.267 --> 13:11.667
Louie, leave me alone, man.

13:11.701 --> 13:13.100
I got enough problems.

13:13.133 --> 13:16.834
Listen, Banta, I can make life
really rough for you

13:16.868 --> 13:20.534
if I wanted to, but you're
Italian and I'm Italian.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.901
So I'm going
to tell you

13:22.934 --> 13:25.334
just like I'd tell
my own brother--

13:25.367 --> 13:27.667
you better smarten up, meatball.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.901
Hi, honey.

13:30.934 --> 13:32.200
Yeah, hi.

13:33.234 --> 13:34.434
Here you go, Louie.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.767
$217?

13:39.801 --> 13:42.033
Hey, you losers hear this?

13:42.067 --> 13:47.300
This sweet young bimbo
just booked $217.

13:47.334 --> 13:50.133
A new Sunshine Cab
company record.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.901
Congratulations, Denise.

13:52.934 --> 13:56.467
I'd shake your hand, but
I'm afraid I'd get you hot.

13:58.334 --> 13:59.801
Thanks, Louie.

14:00.968 --> 14:02.000
What's that you're taking?

14:02.033 --> 14:04.200
Just a couple of bennies
and a black beauty.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.701
What?

14:05.734 --> 14:07.434
You know, uppers.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.400
What are you doing?

14:12.434 --> 14:13.934
I know about
those things.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.367
They can be
hell on you.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.834
They can ruin
your health,

14:16.868 --> 14:17.934
destroy your body.

14:17.968 --> 14:19.367
Why are you
taking them?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.601
It's how I can work
18 hours straight

14:21.634 --> 14:22.801
and book so much.

14:22.834 --> 14:26.767
You got enough I can
give the other guys?

14:28.067 --> 14:29.901
ELAINE:
I'll take three.

14:29.934 --> 14:31.067
BOBBY:
All right.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.734
And then I'll
take three.

14:32.767 --> 14:33.901
Three.

14:33.934 --> 14:35.467
I'll take three.

14:35.501 --> 14:36.901
I got one.

14:36.934 --> 14:38.901
ELAINE:
Okay, I open a quarter.

14:38.934 --> 14:41.234
I raise you
a quarter.

14:41.267 --> 14:42.968
I raise you 50 cents.

14:43.033 --> 14:44.868
All right by me,
I see you.

14:44.901 --> 14:45.934
I see you.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.067
I see you.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.100
I see <i>you.</i>

14:49.133 --> 14:51.467
Come on, Denise,
give me a break.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.234
That's lousy, the way
she keeps bugging him.

14:56.267 --> 14:57.667
JOHN:
Okay, my deal.

14:57.701 --> 14:58.667
LOUIE:
Hey, Rieger.

14:58.701 --> 14:59.667
What?

14:59.701 --> 15:01.167
Move it, the
boss is upstairs

15:01.200 --> 15:02.167
waiting for you.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.100
He wants to talk to you
about the accident.

15:04.133 --> 15:05.167
Yeah, I figured
he would.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.167
Anybody got
an aspirin?

15:06.200 --> 15:07.367
I got a miserable
headache.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.534
Baby aspirin.

15:08.567 --> 15:09.934
Yeah, take one of these.

15:12.734 --> 15:14.834
That doesn't look
like aspirin.

15:14.868 --> 15:16.634
Well, it works
just the same.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.200
I take them all the time
when I get a headache.

15:20.767 --> 15:22.567
You better take
another one.

15:22.601 --> 15:23.934
Thanks-- okay.

15:26.267 --> 15:27.901
How's your
headache?

15:27.934 --> 15:30.734
Hey, I just took the
pills two seconds ago.

15:30.767 --> 15:32.100
You can't expect...

15:34.267 --> 15:35.400
What headache?

15:35.434 --> 15:36.534
What kind of pills are those?

15:36.567 --> 15:37.767
They're called black beauties.

15:37.801 --> 15:39.000
Oh, great, I'll have
to remember that

15:39.033 --> 15:40.067
when I go to
the drugstore.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.901
Hey, wait a minute,
that's amphetamines, isn't it?

15:41.934 --> 15:42.601
Yeah.

15:42.634 --> 15:43.601
I read about those.

15:43.634 --> 15:45.167
Those are poison.
You can kill somebody.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.400
You just gave me two of those?

15:46.434 --> 15:48.200
Alex, the boss
is waiting.

15:48.234 --> 15:49.934
Yeah, Louie, I'm going.

15:49.968 --> 15:52.868
You know, I never took
anything like that before.

15:52.901 --> 15:55.200
Oh, I thought it would
really be strong,

15:55.234 --> 15:56.767
but I don't feel anything.

15:56.801 --> 15:58.667
I guess I must have
a pretty tough system.

15:58.701 --> 16:00.133
I thought it would
really hit me,

16:00.167 --> 16:01.701
but I don't seem
to feel anything.

16:01.734 --> 16:03.701
I don't feel any different
then I ever felt.

16:03.734 --> 16:05.200
I seem to keep
talking, you know?

16:05.234 --> 16:07.000
But I've talked before
and even if I am

16:07.033 --> 16:08.567
talking more now
than I usually do,

16:08.601 --> 16:09.868
I could stop
anytime I want.

16:09.901 --> 16:11.367
There, I just stopped.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.200
I just stopped again.

16:13.234 --> 16:14.968
Hi, Tony.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.200
Hi, Bobby! Hi, Elaine!
Hi, John! Hi, Louie!

16:17.234 --> 16:18.534
You got my cab?

16:18.567 --> 16:19.534
You just came in.

16:19.567 --> 16:21.367
You're going up
to see the boss.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.701
Right-- bye, Louie.

16:22.734 --> 16:25.567
Bye, John! Bye, Elaine!
Bye, Bobby! Bye, Tony!

16:25.601 --> 16:28.734
* Bye-bye, love,
bye-bye, happiness *

16:28.767 --> 16:30.901
* Hello, loneliness

16:30.934 --> 16:33.767
* I think I'm going to die.

16:37.934 --> 16:40.234
Denise, why you giving him
that stuff?

16:40.267 --> 16:42.167
Bad enough you
got to take it.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.234
You got to make
everybody crazy?

16:44.267 --> 16:45.968
Is that what it is?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.300
Is that what's wrong
between us, Tony?

16:47.334 --> 16:48.868
You don't like
me taking pills?

16:48.901 --> 16:50.267
Why didn't
you say so?

16:50.300 --> 16:53.234
Man, I'll never take
another pill as
long as I live.

16:53.267 --> 16:54.767
There.

16:56.801 --> 16:58.834
Hey, what are you guys, crazy?

16:58.868 --> 17:02.367
Denise, it ain't
just the pills.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.032
It's us.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.534
You and me.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.099
Got to end.

17:07.133 --> 17:09.901
It will never end, Tony.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.701
Okay.

17:12.733 --> 17:15.968
Hey, Louie, you got
to fire Denise.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.867
What are you, crazy?

17:17.901 --> 17:19.334
My best booker?

17:19.367 --> 17:20.534
Fire her?

17:20.567 --> 17:22.367
I want to breed her.

17:23.567 --> 17:27.400
Hey, Louie, either you
fire Denise or I quit.

17:30.601 --> 17:32.367
Now, let me think about that.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.601
I thought about it.

17:33.634 --> 17:35.467
It was nice working with you.

17:36.634 --> 17:38.167
Hey, wait a minute, Louie.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.501
You know that chick
only took this job

17:40.534 --> 17:42.000
so she could bug Tony, man.
I mean this whole thing stinks.

17:42.033 --> 17:43.834
I ain't been
happy coming to work

17:43.868 --> 17:45.367
since she's been here.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.934
Now, if you keep her and let him
go, I'm going to quit, too.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.601
That I don't even
have to think about.

17:51.634 --> 17:52.701
Bye-bye, Bobby.

17:52.734 --> 17:54.534
And you can say good-bye to me,
too, Louie.

17:54.567 --> 17:56.000
JOHN:
Yeah, and me, too.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.934
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

17:59.601 --> 18:00.667
Yeah.

18:00.701 --> 18:01.868
So if you let
Tony go

18:01.901 --> 18:03.334
the four
of us quit.

18:03.367 --> 18:06.300
So let it be written,
so let it be done.

18:06.334 --> 18:08.367
Why you quitting?

18:08.400 --> 18:19.334
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

18:20.767 --> 18:22.300
Sounds good enough for me.

18:22.334 --> 18:24.534
If they quit,
we quit, too.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.000
ALL:
Yeah.

18:26.033 --> 18:30.400
( <i>all chanting in</i>
<i>Latka's native language</i> )

18:32.234 --> 18:34.534
Get back, get
back, all of you!

18:34.567 --> 18:35.734
Get back!

18:36.934 --> 18:40.400
Now, listen to me
and listen to me good.

18:40.434 --> 18:42.400
I'm drawing a line here.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.901
Now, you see that line?
You see it?

18:47.934 --> 18:49.501
Look at it,
look at it.

18:49.534 --> 18:54.334
Because if just one of youse
steps one foot across that line,

18:54.367 --> 18:55.734
I'll have
to fire her.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.234
I'm going
to fire her.

18:57.267 --> 18:59.834
Hey, you pill popper,
you're fired.

18:59.868 --> 19:01.000
Get out of here.

19:01.033 --> 19:03.868
( <i>all cheer</i> )

19:08.367 --> 19:10.033
All right.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.200
All right, Tony.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.167
Maybe I can't
work with you...

19:14.267 --> 19:16.167
But you have to go
home sometimes...

19:17.000 --> 19:17.968
and when you do,

19:18.000 --> 19:19.400
you're going
to find me there.

19:19.434 --> 19:20.667
And if you go out to eat,

19:20.701 --> 19:22.367
you're going to find me
there, too.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.667
And if you go
to the movies

19:23.701 --> 19:25.434
or you go bowling,
just look around,

19:25.467 --> 19:27.267
because, baby,
I'm not giving you up.

19:29.467 --> 19:32.200
Hey, Elaine,
what am I going to do?

19:32.234 --> 19:33.868
I can't handle this.

19:33.901 --> 19:36.200
Tony, if you want
to get rid of her,

19:36.234 --> 19:37.734
you're gonna have
to be mean.

19:37.767 --> 19:41.400
You're going to
have to hurt her.

19:41.434 --> 19:42.834
I don't know if I can.

19:42.868 --> 19:45.267
I was raised by my mother
and three older sisters.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.167
I was always taught
to respect women.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.234
Well, she doesn't
give a damn

19:49.267 --> 19:51.901
about what she's
putting you through.

19:51.934 --> 19:52.934
Tony, come on.

19:52.968 --> 19:54.100
Just get as tough
as she is.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.334
I mean, you got to stop
worrying about her feelings

19:56.367 --> 19:58.300
and you got to start
taking care of yourself.

19:58.334 --> 19:59.901
You're right.

19:59.934 --> 20:01.434
Yeah.

20:03.434 --> 20:05.634
Denise, could I have
a word with you?

20:05.667 --> 20:06.934
Sure.

20:08.267 --> 20:10.901
Tony, I know
what it is.

20:10.934 --> 20:12.834
You want to apologize
and that's...

20:12.868 --> 20:15.133
I don't want to
apologize, Denise.

20:15.167 --> 20:16.467
You don't?

20:18.801 --> 20:21.133
No, I don't.

20:21.167 --> 20:23.501
Tony, listen,
I understand.

20:23.534 --> 20:24.801
Shut up!

20:26.334 --> 20:28.300
Just shut up
and listen.

20:29.467 --> 20:31.367
You ain't seeing
me anymore

20:31.400 --> 20:33.634
and I ain't seeing
you anymore.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.167
We ain't seeing
each other anymore.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.534
Psychologists, they got a
term for people like you.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.467
What is it? Uh...

20:39.501 --> 20:42.100
Oh, yeah-- you got
a screw loose.

20:43.467 --> 20:45.033
You ever come
around here again,

20:45.067 --> 20:46.667
I'm going to hand
you your head.

20:46.701 --> 20:49.000
I'm sick and tired
of your face.

20:49.033 --> 20:51.234
Now, why don't you
just take a walk?

20:51.267 --> 20:52.634
Why don't you get out?

20:52.667 --> 20:53.834
You heard me, out!

20:54.868 --> 20:57.801
I love you when
you're like this.

21:01.868 --> 21:02.901
Listen, Denise.

21:02.934 --> 21:04.968
Tony doesn't
want to tell you

21:05.000 --> 21:08.133
the real reason why he
can't see you anymore,

21:08.167 --> 21:09.467
because he's afraid

21:09.501 --> 21:12.234
the truth is going
to hurt you real bad.

21:12.267 --> 21:13.434
The truth?

21:13.467 --> 21:14.801
Yeah, the truth

21:14.834 --> 21:18.067
that he's in love
with someone else.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.400
Who?

21:25.100 --> 21:26.601
Him.

21:33.968 --> 21:35.100
What?

21:35.133 --> 21:37.000
Louie, you're
a homosexual?

21:48.133 --> 21:51.300
( <i>growling</i> )

21:56.834 --> 22:00.601
I prefer to think of it
as an alternative lifestyle.

22:15.534 --> 22:18.501
Did you really think
that I'd believe this?

22:27.634 --> 22:29.501
I guess you really do
want to get rid of me.

22:31.634 --> 22:33.968
I never thought
you'd stoop so low

22:34.000 --> 22:36.100
as to make up
a lie like this.

22:36.133 --> 22:39.167
Hey, Denise, you think
I'm stooping low <i>now?</i>

22:39.200 --> 22:41.467
To get rid of you,
I'd marry him.

22:43.267 --> 22:45.601
You make me sick.

22:45.634 --> 22:46.834
Good-bye.

22:50.133 --> 22:51.267
Elaine.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.601
It worked.

22:52.634 --> 22:54.834
Hey, Louie,
we did it, Louie.

22:54.868 --> 22:58.067
What do you mean,
stoop so low?

23:06.300 --> 23:08.000
Boy, you know that Mackenzie
is one great boss.

23:08.033 --> 23:09.901
I mean, I really thought
he was going to blast me,

23:09.934 --> 23:11.667
but he hardly said two words
to me the whole time.

23:11.701 --> 23:13.000
I was the one
who did all the talking.

23:13.033 --> 23:14.300
I just explained
the accident to him,

23:14.334 --> 23:15.667
reminded him
of my good driving record,

23:15.701 --> 23:17.601
told him why Pittsburgh was
going to win the Super Bowl

23:17.634 --> 23:18.934
and how I'd like to see
that situation

23:18.968 --> 23:20.100
in the Middle East cleared up,

23:20.133 --> 23:22.067
and he just sat there the whole
time with his mouth open.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.334
So how's everybody here?

23:23.367 --> 23:25.501
Am I talking too loud?
No, I don't think I am.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.634
Hey, listen, you know
Pittsburgh is gonna win.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.167
That defense is just too strong.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.801
Look at that backfield--
Harris, Blier,

23:30.834 --> 23:33.033
Blier's the most
underrated halfback in the NFL.

23:33.067 --> 23:34.901
Nobody blocks Blier.
He runs, he blocks.

23:34.934 --> 23:36.400
He's got a pair of great hands.

23:36.434 --> 23:38.934
Talking about hands,
what about Swann?

23:38.968 --> 23:40.234
You can't stop him.

23:40.267 --> 23:42.968
When Bradshaw's off,
Swann gets the ball.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.667
And look at that
defensive line.

23:44.701 --> 23:46.834
Do you realize
that they've only allowed

23:46.868 --> 23:48.767
an average of three
yards per carry.

23:48.801 --> 23:50.934
And what about
those linebackers?

23:50.968 --> 23:52.200
You can't get through them.

23:52.234 --> 23:54.067
You couldn't drive
a truck through them.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.400
I mean, you can't get there.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.601
Boy, am I going to be
sick tomorrow.

24:01.334 --> 24:04.167
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

24:28.334 --> 24:29.901
WOMAN:
Night, Mr. Walters.

24:29.934 --> 24:31.267
