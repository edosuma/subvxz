WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:12.137
Here we go.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.056
<i>Good evening, America.</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:18.143
<i>There are decisions
that we are asked to make in our lifetimes</i>

00:18.143 --> 00:19.478
<i>that are truly humbling.</i>

00:20.437 --> 00:24.900
<i>Decisions that in previous times
would have been left to the gods.</i>

00:25.901 --> 00:28.529
<i>But the current crisis
requires that we act</i>

00:28.529 --> 00:32.281
<i>from the limited perspective
of human experience.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:35.577
<i>I have prayed for guidance,</i>

00:35.577 --> 00:38.539
<i>sought out the wisdom
of fellow G22 leaders</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:42.918
<i>as well as members of the scientific
community, the business community,</i>

00:42.918 --> 00:46.296
<i>and religious and Indigenous leaders
of every stripe.</i>

00:47.256 --> 00:48.966
<i>And we have come to a decision.</i>

00:49.967 --> 00:55.013
<i>I will be signing CIT 2,
the Climate Intervention Treaty,</i>

00:55.013 --> 00:59.351
<i>and extending the moratorium
on geoengineering</i>

00:59.351 --> 01:03.272
<i>or any act that seeks
to artificially manipulate the climate.</i>

01:04.105 --> 01:06.817
<i>Technology alone
is not the solution we require.</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:07.901
Alpha, off.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.696
- Hey, Ro.
- I can't watch this.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.199
Congrats, Dad.
The president took your advice.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.326
- Kiddo, come on.
- Now we're all fucked.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.078
I hope you're proud of yourself.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.832
I gave her that advice to try
to protect your future, man.

01:22.708 --> 01:23.709
I'm sorry, everyone.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.043
Hey, Alpha, on. Sorry.

01:25.043 --> 01:29.423
<i>We must look elsewhere
if we are to solve this crisis.</i>

02:24.520 --> 02:26.271
You hear from Rowan yet?

02:27.856 --> 02:29.816
For what it's worth, I think it's shitty.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.777
He said he was coming. He should be here.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.363
It's Father's Day. You're his father.

02:36.031 --> 02:39.910
I remember being 20, and Father's Day
was not my priority holiday either.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.622
And my dad didn't get married three times,
so there is that.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.126
Well,
we don't have to be back until tomorrow,

02:48.126 --> 02:51.046
so why don't you decide
what you wanna do to celebrate,

02:51.630 --> 02:54.341
- and I'll go make us something to eat.
- Okay.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.183
Call Rowan again.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.484
Gonna make my speech here...

03:13.277 --> 03:17.281
and there'll be a huge reveal
behind these glass doors.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.243
Is it Jonathan?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.370
Maybe you should answer it.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.122
Yeah, and say what?

03:25.122 --> 03:27.124
Well, "Happy Father's Day."

03:27.124 --> 03:29.793
Well, that's the easy part.
It's everything after that.

03:30.294 --> 03:33.630
You know, your father used to
quote Hemingway to me.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.926
"The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."

03:39.094 --> 03:40.304
Maybe you should try that.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.016
It would kill him to know
that I was helping you.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.226
Maybe he'd be proud.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.438
I guess we'll find out soon enough.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.275
<i>Okay, so we're never gonna
agree on geoengineering, I get it.</i>

03:53.275 --> 03:56.528
But this is six months, you know.
It's like he's got complete tunnel vision.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.447
It's like we can't talk
about anything else.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.990
He needs some space. It's--

03:59.990 --> 04:01.450
Sorry.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.534
Rowan?

04:05.412 --> 04:06.413
Did you find him?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.790
<i>Djibouti. Logged on to his Alpha social.</i>

04:08.790 --> 04:12.252
- Is she with him?
- This is wrong on many levels.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.172
<i>Come on. Make it look
like normal course of business checks.</i>

04:15.172 --> 04:17.173
- We did this all the time.
- You don't work here anymore,

04:17.173 --> 04:18.509
so that would be a lie.

04:18.509 --> 04:22.804
And the last thing we need is a story
about Alpha spying on random people.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.223
Please. This isn't surveillance.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.766
We're not hacking her password.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.976
Just look at payments.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.062
<i>Did she, you know--
Did she get a pedicure.</i>

04:30.062 --> 04:32.105
<i>Did she search
for her favorite fucking sneakers,</i>

04:32.105 --> 04:34.358
- or-- This is plain vanilla. Come on.
- Jon, seriously.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.527
- This is easy.
- You're a US government official now.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.529
Just ask the CIA to do it.

04:39.196 --> 04:42.783
Or try the old-fashioned approach
and just call your son.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.161
Yeah, I've done that like a half
a dozen times. He doesn't even pick up.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.955
<i>Now you know why I never had kids.</i>

04:50.499 --> 04:51.834
Why are they in Djibouti?

04:51.834 --> 04:54.545
I didn't say, "they." I said, "Rowan."

04:55.754 --> 04:59.967
And if you didn't want him to join her
fan club, you shouldn't have married her.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.846
Thanks. Yeah, well, keep at it.
Just keep me updated.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.058
- Any news on Rowan?
- Nope. Work drama.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.649
When I was his age,
I fought with my parents relentlessly.

05:15.649 --> 05:19.361
You did? Their Ivy League superstar.
Over what?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.405
Typical teenage stuff.

05:21.905 --> 05:25.659
My pick of boyfriends.
The fate of the world.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.959
From humble beginnings to greatness.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.422
The daughter of a math teacher
and an engineer in Badlapur, India,

05:38.422 --> 05:44.178
Gita Mishra stands before us today
as CEO and founder of New Sky Initiatives

05:44.178 --> 05:46.430
to celebrate the inaugural flight

05:46.430 --> 05:50.767
of the world's first unmanned,
fully carbon-neutral cargo plane,

05:50.767 --> 05:53.770
capable of staying aloft perpetually.

05:54.605 --> 05:55.647
The Rowan.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.942
Gita Mishra, everyone.

06:01.612 --> 06:06.116
Thank you, Hiram. And thank you for
your help in getting the Rowan in the air.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.785
Yes, the Rowan.

06:09.536 --> 06:15.751
Named for my stepson and colleague,
Rowan Chopin, who is here today.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.211
Come and take a bow.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.007
Do you like the name?

06:22.007 --> 06:23.383
Yeah.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.387
Rowan's work
on the computer interface of our plane

06:27.387 --> 06:31.975
has made unmanned flight possible
at a level never before seen.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.977
I'd say he takes after his stepmother,

06:33.977 --> 06:36.813
but I suspect his father
has more to do with it.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.695
Now, as many of you know,
I am a betting woman.

06:43.695 --> 06:47.866
And I want to thank all of you here today
who invested,

06:48.367 --> 06:51.662
for betting with me and on me.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.914
And to make it clear

06:53.914 --> 06:58.544
just how much confidence I have
in our carbon-neutral tech,

06:58.544 --> 07:02.381
I'm actually going to lead
today's test flight myself.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.301
The planes have all been loaded

07:06.301 --> 07:10.806
with a maximum payload of 250 tons
for this morning's demonstration.

07:12.349 --> 07:18.981
If we are asking people to trust the Rowan
with their most precious cargo,

07:20.315 --> 07:23.610
then I think it only natural
that I make myself the guinea pig.

07:25.863 --> 07:26.864
Thank you.

07:41.920 --> 07:46.258
I don't know why
I'm telling you this, but I found them.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.970
"Them?" So, they are together?
Goddamn it.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.806
<i>I'm sending you something right now.</i>

07:55.184 --> 07:58.604
<i>Thank you, Hiram. And thank you for
your help in getting the Rowan in the air.</i>

07:58.604 --> 07:59.813
What the fuck is that?

08:00.731 --> 08:02.691
<i>You're supposed to say, "thank you."</i>

08:02.691 --> 08:04.359
Thank you. What the fuck is that?

08:04.359 --> 08:10.073
<i>It's NSI's new pilotless cargo drone.
Very hush-hush. Full media embargo.</i>

08:10.782 --> 08:11.825
How'd you get it?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.911
<i>Scraped it off an illicit phone
in the room.</i>

08:14.411 --> 08:16.038
<i>And spare me the surprised face.</i>

08:16.622 --> 08:18.624
<i>Evidently,
she named the plane "the Rowan."</i>

08:18.624 --> 08:19.833
My God.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.919
Certainly explains why he's there.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.129
<i>Doesn't explain
why he didn't tell me about it.</i>

08:24.129 --> 08:27.466
It also doesn't explain why she's flying
a plane that's supposed to be pilotless.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.800
Does that make any sense to you?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.429
<i>None of this makes any sense to me, Jon.</i>

08:34.515 --> 08:35.933
<i>I'm erasing all of it.</i>

08:37.851 --> 08:40.102
Thank you, Martha.
I know you're going out on a limb.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.313
<i>Not to add insult to injury,</i>

08:42.313 --> 08:47.402
but Mr. Bilton might order a few
depending on how it goes today.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.487
What?

08:48.487 --> 08:51.198
<i>What? She's using our batteries.</i>

08:54.535 --> 08:55.536
Good night.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.093
- You know, he probably already knows.
- How would that happen?

09:11.093 --> 09:16.056
And when he does find out because he will,
everyone will in a few hours.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.891
Just tell him it was all my idea.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.812
Tell him that I tricked you
and that you had no idea what I was up to.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.523
I'm not gonna lie to him.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.905
Remind him of our honeymoon.

09:34.283 --> 09:39.246
We were at an old hotel in Bali
and the toilet broke.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.583
And Jonathan couldn't fix it.

09:43.834 --> 09:47.129
I mean, the man could model
albedo feedback loops on sea-level rise

09:47.129 --> 09:50.007
that were accurate to the centimeter,

09:51.425 --> 09:54.469
but was baffled by a chain and float
in a 20th-century commode.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.972
And I used to fix it daily.

09:59.266 --> 10:04.479
When we got home, I bought him a copy
of the Whole Earth Catalog from 1968.

10:04.479 --> 10:08.108
First edition. It was autographed as well.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.736
And that told you how to fix toilets?

10:10.736 --> 10:12.654
How to fix everything.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.157
The first line,

10:15.866 --> 10:20.787
"We are as gods,
and might as well get good at it."

10:21.830 --> 10:25.792
And today,
we're fixing something a little bigger.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.180
The other planes, they're all ready?

10:39.598 --> 10:41.683
I'll put in the coordinates
once they're airborne.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.145
You release your cargo. They do the same.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.358
They'll never let it get that far, right?

10:49.358 --> 10:51.109
- It's just--
- Hey, Ro.

10:53.070 --> 10:57.032
If you don't want to be here anymore,
you can leave, you know?

11:00.702 --> 11:02.246
I just want it to be tomorrow.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.999
It will be soon.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.781
You're changing all of those?

11:38.490 --> 11:40.617
Gita wanted all the passcodes changed.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.245
It's been six years of work.
Can't get hacked now.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.497
Did you know about this?

11:46.081 --> 11:48.542
Did I know she was worried
about security? Yeah.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.419
There. Done.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.421
Leader one, leader one, NSI tower.

11:52.921 --> 11:53.964
Go for leader one.

11:53.964 --> 11:58.969
Locked and loaded for 19.1668 north
and 73.2368 east.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.180
<i>Thank you, NSI tower.</i>

12:02.764 --> 12:05.142
Wait. Where are you going?

12:05.142 --> 12:07.686
Badlapur. Haven't been there in years.

12:07.686 --> 12:08.770
<i>Why?</i>

12:09.563 --> 12:13.984
Hometown girl makes good.
Maybe I'll inspire the next generation.

12:17.905 --> 12:23.827
<i>If we are asking people to trust
the Rowan with their most precious cargo,</i>

12:23.827 --> 12:26.663
<i>then I think it only natural
that I make myself the--</i>

12:28.081 --> 12:32.878
<i>The planes have all been loaded
with a maximum payload of 250 tons</i>

12:32.878 --> 12:34.880
<i>for this morning's demonstration.</i>

12:36.340 --> 12:37.466
You're up early.

12:37.466 --> 12:42.721
<i>...we are asking people to trust
the Rowan with their most precious cargo...</i>

12:42.721 --> 12:44.515
You're lucky I don't have the gene
for jealousy.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.766
No, watch this.

12:46.725 --> 12:51.730
<i>The planes have all been loaded
with a maximum payload of 250 tons</i>

12:51.730 --> 12:53.524
<i>for this morning's demonstration.</i>

12:55.067 --> 12:56.276
Rowan's with her.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.570
- Where?
- There.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.364
<i>...most precious cargo,</i>

13:00.989 --> 13:04.451
<i>then I think it only natural
that I make myself the guinea pig.</i>

13:04.451 --> 13:05.953
I've gotta tell someone
what's going on here.

13:05.953 --> 13:09.164
Tell them what? Tell them
your son is going through a phase?

13:09.164 --> 13:11.917
Tell them he prefers
his stepmother's company to his father's?

13:11.917 --> 13:14.711
No. Why do you think she's getting ready
to pilot an unmanned aircraft?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.923
I don't know, Jonathan.
I also don't particularly care.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.758
- Why do you?
- Because of this.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.761
- Watch.
- In 1991,

13:22.761 --> 13:25.597
<i>there was a volcanic eruption.
Mount Pinatubo.</i>

13:25.597 --> 13:27.057
This is what it's all about.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.852
<i>It sent ash ten miles up
into the stratosphere.</i>

13:29.852 --> 13:30.936
What is this?

13:30.936 --> 13:33.772
It's Rowan's science project
in fifth grade. Listen.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.234
<i>The ash spread all over the stratosphere.</i>

13:37.234 --> 13:41.530
<i>Billions of particles. And these particles
reflected the sun's rays.</i>

13:41.530 --> 13:45.117
<i>That year,
the planet actually cooled .5 degrees.</i>

13:45.117 --> 13:48.161
<i>After years of consistent warming,
it cooled.</i>

13:48.161 --> 13:52.207
<i>So, some scientists started experimenting
with reproducing that effect.</i>

13:52.207 --> 13:54.459
<i>My stepmom is one of those scientists.</i>

13:55.294 --> 13:57.462
<i>And she says
this will solve climate change.</i>

13:58.422 --> 14:00.340
<i>And my dad says she's right.</i>

14:10.809 --> 14:12.978
Sir, she's ascending.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.607
You hit a button up there
by mistake, Gita?

14:17.107 --> 14:19.193
Nope. New heading.

14:19.193 --> 14:20.319
<i>Any reason?</i>

14:21.236 --> 14:25.115
Because I think it's important for people
to see what the Rowan is capable of.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.576
48,000 feet. Over.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.872
Okay, that's above the ceiling
for most commercial aircraft.

14:31.872 --> 14:35.292
<i>We're not selling
most commercial aircrafts.</i>

14:35.292 --> 14:37.711
We did not file this
as part of your flight plan.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.796
Military is gonna be all over us now.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.257
So much for keeping this hidden.

14:43.550 --> 14:47.304
<i>NSI tower, let's take
the other planes up to 48,000 feet.</i>

14:48.055 --> 14:49.056
Yep. On it.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.474
<i>Leader out.</i>

15:00.859 --> 15:02.444
Alpha, give me the earnings performance

15:02.444 --> 15:04.279
of the top chemical companies
for the last quarter.

15:04.863 --> 15:10.202
<i>BASF is down 1%.
Sinopec, down 2%. Dow Chemical, unchanged.</i>

15:10.202 --> 15:11.286
What about Alpha Chem?

15:11.787 --> 15:14.623
<i>Alpha Chemical Resources up 16%.</i>

15:14.623 --> 15:17.334
Alpha is always up. They own the world.

15:17.334 --> 15:18.460
Slow down, Jon.

15:18.460 --> 15:22.464
This doesn't prove anything other than
that Nick Bilton is a very rich man.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.466
Hey, what is this?

15:24.466 --> 15:27.386
I ordered some lab steaks
from Alpha Protein.

15:27.386 --> 15:29.513
We're gonna have
a really nice dinner tonight.

15:30.556 --> 15:32.140
Your delivery has arrived.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.021
Alpha, call Martha private.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.776
- Are you out of your mind?
- Maybe.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.737
- I need to know something.
- No, I need to know something.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.031
Why don't you have any boundaries?

15:48.031 --> 15:52.369
Look, I need to know if Alpha Chemical
sold NSI any of the following substances.

15:52.870 --> 15:56.874
Calcium carbonate, hydrogen sulfide,
or sulfur dioxide.

15:56.874 --> 15:59.168
I can't possibly answer that.

15:59.168 --> 16:02.004
Come on. Those are controlled substances
now under CIT.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.715
I have every right to know if significant
quantities have been ordered,

16:04.715 --> 16:07.301
especially by a buyer
without purchasing history.

16:07.301 --> 16:09.344
No, I'm not answering.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.139
<i>A significant amount of any
of those substances could be used</i>

16:12.139 --> 16:15.184
<i>in an act of global terrorism.
Do you wanna be an accessory to that?</i>

16:15.184 --> 16:17.144
Martha, just tell me if I'm wrong.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.980
I've gotta know
if I'm calling the authorities here.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.361
I'll need to speak to our chief counsel, Jon.

16:27.196 --> 16:30.324
I've always thought of you as a friend,
and I felt horrible when Nick let you go,

16:30.324 --> 16:32.868
<i>but I'm gonna have to ask you
to never contact me again.</i>

16:33.368 --> 16:34.453
Wait, wait. Are--

16:38.248 --> 16:39.249
Fuck.

16:54.723 --> 17:00.062
<i>Gita, are you turning around soon?
We have AFRICOM asking about us.</i>

17:00.771 --> 17:04.148
They're already in touch with DC,
with NATO.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.779
- I don't know what you're doing, but--
- Hiram, put Rowan on, please.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.364
And give us a private line.

17:17.621 --> 17:18.622
Hey, it's me.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.999
<i>I think we need to assume
they know by now.</i>

17:21.875 --> 17:24.086
<i>We're on everyone's radar
higher than we should be.</i>

17:25.378 --> 17:26.463
It's time, hon.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.260
<i>They'll contact your father
when they've figured it out.</i>

17:31.885 --> 17:33.136
<i>You need to move now.</i>

17:33.846 --> 17:34.847
Yeah, good to see you.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.348
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.482
I'm Special Agent Sanchez
from the FBI's counterterrorism unit.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.776
I'm looking for Dr. Jonathan Chopin.

17:48.318 --> 17:49.319
Jonathan?

17:49.319 --> 17:51.613
Yeah, hi. Thanks for coming. Come on in.

17:51.613 --> 17:54.366
- You called the FBI?
- Yeah. Come in. We need to talk.

17:58.579 --> 17:59.997
Perhaps someday,

17:59.997 --> 18:06.378
we will have a machine that safely
and reliably removes carbon from the air,

18:06.378 --> 18:11.341
but until then,
we have something even better. Trees.

18:13.552 --> 18:17.055
So, thank you
to the Sunrise Movement for this,

18:17.055 --> 18:19.892
the one-millionth tree
planted in Virginia.

18:20.601 --> 18:24.730
Now we just need Congress to do its job

18:24.730 --> 18:30.903
and work together to pass
bipartisan legislation to curb emissions.

18:32.613 --> 18:33.614
What next?

18:33.614 --> 18:36.283
There is a situation developing
over the Gulf of Aden.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.118
A fleet of planes headed east.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.914
AFRICOM is tracking it.
I have Major Gutiérrez from AFRICOM.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.336
Good morning, Major. What can you tell me?

18:47.336 --> 18:49.505
We just heard
from Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti.

18:49.505 --> 18:53.217
It's a demonstration flight.
Some sort of new technology.

18:53.217 --> 18:56.512
A formation of private aircraft
built by New Sky Initiatives.

18:56.512 --> 18:59.765
Gita Mishra's company.
Was this authorized?

18:59.765 --> 19:01.308
The flight was, yes, ma'am,

19:01.308 --> 19:03.352
but then they changed their flight plan
while aloft.

19:03.352 --> 19:06.605
They're now currently at 43,000 feet
and rising.

19:06.605 --> 19:09.274
- Did they give a reason for the change?
- No, ma'am.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.445
- Have they responded to any communication?
- No, ma'am.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.783
Is there a reason to believe
that there's an issue with the plane?

19:17.783 --> 19:20.536
- A distress signal?
- No, Madam President.

19:22.538 --> 19:24.456
Well, thank you, Major. Keep me apprised.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.422
The FBI has been made aware. Counterterrorism.

19:33.549 --> 19:36.218
- Who asked for that?
- You remember Jonathan Chopin?

19:37.302 --> 19:38.303
Remind me.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.931
Secretary of State Garrett appointed him
to the carbon commission.

19:41.515 --> 19:43.517
Used to work for Nick Bilton
over at Alpha.

19:43.517 --> 19:44.768
That's right. Chopin.

19:44.768 --> 19:49.356
Also used to be married to Gita Mishra.
He reached out to us.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.149
About his ex-wife?

19:51.149 --> 19:53.235
He has a pretty crazy theory.

19:53.235 --> 19:56.113
We may want to consider
distancing ourselves from him.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.544
<i>So you think your son is involved
with some sort of illegal activity?</i>

20:10.544 --> 20:14.464
I haven't spoken to my son
in many weeks.

20:15.215 --> 20:18.760
We've noticed a fair amount of phone
activity between your number and his.

20:18.760 --> 20:22.556
If you looked at that, then you also
noticed he hasn't answered me even once.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.433
That's-- That is not normal for him.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.728
Could mean a lot of things besides
international terrorism, Doctor.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.814
You might wanna call a family therapist
instead of the Bureau.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.482
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

20:32.482 --> 20:35.569
This isn't about my family.
I'm talking about a global security event.

20:37.321 --> 20:39.364
I'm one of President Burdick's
lead science advisers.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.657
I have a security clearance.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.869
I know who you are, Doctor. I took
the liberty of reviewing your background.

20:43.869 --> 20:47.080
Okay, so then--
then you know, in the past,

20:47.080 --> 20:50.334
I was an advocate for something
called geoengineering, okay?

20:50.334 --> 20:54.880
And my very famous ex-wife
and I put a lot of resource

20:54.880 --> 20:57.299
and focus into not just imagining it,

20:57.299 --> 20:59.801
but contemplating
how would you actually do it.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.553
She called it the biggest
and the brightest

21:01.553 --> 21:04.389
new business opportunity
of the century at Davos.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.684
Here's the thing. We were wrong.
We were arrogant.

21:07.684 --> 21:11.021
We disrespected
one of the most fundamental principles

21:11.021 --> 21:12.523
of scientific investigation,

21:12.523 --> 21:15.484
which is that an experiment
has to be able to be replicated

21:15.484 --> 21:17.986
to get the same results,
or based on the data,

21:17.986 --> 21:19.488
to change the experiment.

21:20.364 --> 21:22.366
Geoengineering doesn't allow for that, okay?

21:22.366 --> 21:25.285
You get one shot,
and then you live with the results.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.914
That's not science. That's gambling.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.795
And you decided you weren't a gambler.

21:34.795 --> 21:38.048
With the planet as the table stakes?
No. No.

21:40.759 --> 21:43.220
And how exactly
does this tie into your son?

21:43.720 --> 21:44.888
Because he's with her.

21:45.514 --> 21:48.767
He's with her, and he's gone dark on me
because she's planning something.

21:48.767 --> 21:52.479
And if we don't wanna be
a part of the gamble that she's taking,

21:52.479 --> 21:56.775
you need to help me get to Washington.
I need to get to DC.

21:58.402 --> 22:01.280
<i>Dear President Burdick
and other world leaders.</i>

22:01.280 --> 22:04.324
<i>By the time you see this,
I will be over the Indian Ocean.</i>

22:04.324 --> 22:07.786
Gita's a donor.
You actually spoke at an event she hosted.

22:07.786 --> 22:10.289
I am aware. And the ex? Chopin?

22:10.289 --> 22:12.958
He's inbound.
We did confirm that his son is with her.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.585
- In the plane?
- Possibly.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.006
<i>Any attempt to stop me by violent means</i>

22:19.006 --> 22:21.884
<i>will cause a worldwide deployment
of calcium carbonate,</i>

22:21.884 --> 22:24.469
<i>which cannot be stopped
by military intervention.</i>

22:24.469 --> 22:26.805
We do have a SEAL team in the region.

22:27.306 --> 22:30.100
<i>My demands are simple, Madam President.</i>

22:30.809 --> 22:34.104
<i>I'm only doing what should've been done
by world leaders years ago.</i>

22:35.272 --> 22:40.444
<i>Temperature on Earth has risen
...65 degrees since the Tel Aviv Accords.</i>

22:40.444 --> 22:42.404
<i>It continues to rise.</i>

22:43.488 --> 22:45.782
<i>The cost to the world economy
is immeasurable.</i>

22:46.283 --> 22:51.038
<i>This is the only way
to slow temperature increase immediately.</i>

22:52.372 --> 22:54.541
<i>Is it a Band-Aid? Yes.</i>

22:55.501 --> 23:01.215
<i>But when one is bleeding the way our
planet is bleeding, a Band-Aid is needed.</i>

23:01.840 --> 23:05.469
<i>If the United States will commit
to geoengineering,</i>

23:06.261 --> 23:12.059
<i>I will land without incident,
and we can solve this problem together.</i>

23:12.559 --> 23:14.353
How far is she from landfall?

23:14.353 --> 23:17.314
- Two hours and 12 minutes.
- Let's get everyone together.

23:20.609 --> 23:24.029
Rowan, tell me when you're safe. Over.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.326
Let's go! Everybody on the ground.

23:30.786 --> 23:32.204
- Now!
- Move your hands.

23:32.704 --> 23:33.997
Where are they?

23:35.999 --> 23:37.167
Ro, do you copy?

23:41.421 --> 23:43.632
Go, go! Stay where you are.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.175
- Nobody move.
- He's not here!

23:45.175 --> 23:46.718
Where's the kid?

23:46.718 --> 23:48.220
Where is he?

23:50.180 --> 23:53.642
Come on, Ro.
It's okay if you've changed your mind.

23:53.642 --> 23:56.854
Just let me know you're safe.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.662
<i>Go for squadron leader.</i>

24:14.663 --> 24:16.123
Ro, you're okay.

24:16.707 --> 24:17.833
<i>All good.</i>

24:17.833 --> 24:19.751
It's like I'm sitting off your tail.

24:20.335 --> 24:22.004
<i>Do you see that up there?</i>

24:22.838 --> 24:24.506
- India.
- It's Mumbai.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.426
My mum helped design the seawall there.

24:27.426 --> 24:29.928
I remember watching them build it
when I was little.

24:30.470 --> 24:33.640
What's taking Burdick so long?
I know she received our demands.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.143
<i>They're trying to figure out a way
to publicly condemn me,</i>

24:36.143 --> 24:38.562
<i>privately thank me,
just like the rest of them.</i>

24:39.229 --> 24:41.940
<i>Alpha. The oil companies.</i>

24:41.940 --> 24:43.150
You're an hour out.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.280
It all looks so beautiful from up here.

24:50.199 --> 24:53.118
<i>You'd never know
how badly we fucked it up.</i>

25:08.383 --> 25:11.220
Madam President, I know
you're very well-informed on all of this,

25:11.220 --> 25:13.180
so for the benefit of everyone...

25:13.180 --> 25:16.016
I think it helps to look
at climate change like a bear.

25:16.016 --> 25:20.729
And the whole planet's been in the ring
wrestling with the bear for decades now.

25:20.729 --> 25:23.690
And so far,
the bear's been kicking our ass.

25:24.525 --> 25:27.444
Geoengineering is like taking a lion

25:27.444 --> 25:30.364
and deciding to put it in the ring
to help you fight the bear.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.282
It's certainly gonna change things,

25:32.282 --> 25:35.744
but not necessarily guarantee
that you're gonna win.

25:35.744 --> 25:38.205
If she does what she's threatening,
what are we looking at?

25:38.205 --> 25:42.501
Changes in rainfall patterns that lead
to crop failures and floods.

25:43.001 --> 25:45.796
Extreme weather events
leading to mass migrations,

25:45.796 --> 25:47.464
social unrest, stress on infrastructure.

25:47.464 --> 25:50.217
All the wonderful things
that we're so familiar with,

25:50.217 --> 25:53.470
except now in new and
totally unpredictable places.

25:53.470 --> 25:58.600
Hence, CIT 2. I think we need to
call this what it is. It's terrorism.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.395
I spoke to other leaders.
Oliveira, Liang, Richter.

26:01.395 --> 26:05.399
They all stand by CIT and feel
that the legal exposure here is ours.

26:05.399 --> 26:06.733
How's that?

26:06.733 --> 26:09.862
New Sky is a Delaware corporation
based in New Mexico.

26:09.862 --> 26:11.905
The rest of the world sees a violation

26:11.905 --> 26:14.408
of the treaty as an act
of unilateral aggression.

26:15.701 --> 26:18.412
You know her.
You think she'd actually do it?

26:19.788 --> 26:21.790
I wouldn't doubt her resolve
for one minute.

26:22.416 --> 26:25.586
I mean,
she's worked these models for years.

26:25.586 --> 26:28.463
You've seen her lectures.
You've hosted one, Madam President.

26:28.463 --> 26:29.715
But can she?

26:30.841 --> 26:32.759
She didn't start a social network
to get rich.

26:32.759 --> 26:36.263
She's one of the most talented
chemical engineers of our generation.

26:36.263 --> 26:40.267
She gets a lot more right
than she gets wrong.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.604
I would not bet on her failure.

26:43.604 --> 26:47.107
We don't hand over policy
to individual billionaires,

26:47.107 --> 26:48.984
even ones that are good at guessing.

26:48.984 --> 26:52.237
With all due respect,
I'm not sure that's historically accurate.

26:52.237 --> 26:56.700
But Gita's success has never rested
on waiting for permission.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.870
But why this? Geoengineering,
it's not a one-time event.

26:59.870 --> 27:02.956
You'd need to do it every few years.

27:02.956 --> 27:05.375
You know, I think she just wants
to change the conversation.

27:05.375 --> 27:08.295
She thinks when it works,
people will start to follow her lead.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.589
But that's--
that's not the core of the problem.

27:10.589 --> 27:12.382
If it works,

27:12.382 --> 27:15.969
all the oil and gas and coal
and other dirty, polluting industries,

27:15.969 --> 27:17.554
they're gonna be knocking
on your door asking

27:17.554 --> 27:19.681
for permission to continue
the carbon party.

27:19.681 --> 27:22.935
That's-- That is why I'm here with you
and not up there with her.

27:26.146 --> 27:27.981
- She's made contact.
- Okay.

27:27.981 --> 27:31.735
We managed to establish communications.
She wants to talk.

27:39.201 --> 27:40.285
Ms. Mishra.

27:41.036 --> 27:42.204
<i>Madam President.</i>

27:42.204 --> 27:44.498
The last time I saw you was at Davos.

27:44.498 --> 27:47.084
<i>I apologize for the circumstances.</i>

27:47.084 --> 27:50.170
Well, I'd like to see
those circumstances change.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.964
I was wondering if I could convince you

27:52.464 --> 27:55.217
to come back here
and talk things over.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.761
I learn something new
every time I'm with you.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.680
<i>And so do I, Madam President.</i>

27:59.680 --> 28:04.476
<i>I learn that even very talented
and powerful people, like yourself,</i>

28:04.476 --> 28:08.063
<i>can be confined by broken systems
that limit them.</i>

28:08.063 --> 28:09.481
I appreciate that,

28:09.481 --> 28:13.527
but CIT 2 is the decision
our broken system came to,

28:13.527 --> 28:18.574
and it would be an even more broken system
if you take unilateral action.

28:18.574 --> 28:21.660
<i>There are ten million people
from my homeland</i>

28:21.660 --> 28:26.123
<i>trapped between a resource war to the
north and droughts to the south and east,</i>

28:26.123 --> 28:28.041
- and tens of millions more...
- Come on.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.002
<i>...in every country and every continent</i>

28:30.002 --> 28:33.213
- dying in the heat every day.
- This has nothing to do with the science.

28:33.213 --> 28:36.175
<i>And the very people
who have done the least</i>

28:36.175 --> 28:39.636
<i>to cause this catastrophe
are perishing because of it.</i>

28:40.220 --> 28:43.432
<i>I'm assuming that all of you are sitting
in an air-conditioned room</i>

28:43.432 --> 28:47.936
- discussing their fate with me right now.
- I'm only the president of one country.

28:47.936 --> 28:52.733
And that is why I would like you to
land safely, so that we can discuss this.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.653
I cannot promise you that the Chinese,
or the French,

28:56.653 --> 28:59.239
or the Israelis are gonna
offer you the same option.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.617
And they are aware of your location.

29:01.617 --> 29:05.078
<i>You know,
all it takes is two million tons</i>

29:05.078 --> 29:09.833
<i>of calcium carbonate dispersed into the
atmosphere to begin to cool the planet.</i>

29:09.833 --> 29:13.170
And how many children might die
because of the additional air pollution?

29:13.170 --> 29:15.839
<i>Madam Secretary, I can't answer that,</i>

29:15.839 --> 29:18.759
<i>but far fewer
than are currently dying in Africa,</i>

29:18.759 --> 29:21.678
<i>in Indonesia, in Texas even.</i>

29:21.678 --> 29:25.098
There are better ways, Ms. Mishra.
Even you must see that.

29:25.098 --> 29:26.225
<i>Yeah, of course, there are.</i>

29:26.808 --> 29:30.270
<i>You know, and if the billionaires this
century gave birth to had focused on them</i>

29:30.270 --> 29:33.815
<i>instead of proving their manhood
by shooting rockets into space,</i>

29:34.858 --> 29:36.777
- I would not be here now.
- Keep her talking.

29:36.777 --> 29:38.529
...then her plan no longer works,
and she'll call it off.

29:38.529 --> 29:40.447
Gita, I know that there's--

29:40.447 --> 29:42.824
there's a way that we can
work together on this.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.701
We have the same goal.

29:44.701 --> 29:48.205
What if I--
What if I try to reconvene the G22,

29:48.705 --> 29:52.668
and we meet with you and try to see
if we can find some middle ground?

29:52.668 --> 29:55.671
<i>I think you already had that meeting,
Madam President.</i>

29:56.213 --> 29:58.757
<i>Look, we have the technology
to solve a problem.</i>

29:58.757 --> 30:00.467
<i>Are we going to use it,</i>

30:00.467 --> 30:03.470
<i>or just sit by
while the problem solves us?</i>

30:03.470 --> 30:06.390
But what if it's us
that's the problem, Gita?

30:06.390 --> 30:07.975
What-- It's human behavior.

30:07.975 --> 30:12.145
It's how we move ourselves around
and how we eat and how we build.

30:12.145 --> 30:16.149
We've treated this planet like
an all-you-can-eat buffet for 250 years

30:16.149 --> 30:18.402
since we started burning fossil fuels.

30:18.402 --> 30:22.823
And changing the chemical composition
of the atmosphere is not going to fix it.

30:22.823 --> 30:25.576
<i>Jonathan, there you are.</i>

30:26.743 --> 30:30.873
<i>Madam President, I'm sure Jonathan
has told you about the bear and the lion.</i>

30:31.456 --> 30:33.166
<i>And maybe he's told you</i>

30:33.166 --> 30:35.127
<i>that what I'm doing
is a reckless experiment</i>

30:35.127 --> 30:38.297
- that can only be done once, but--
- That's right, because it is.

30:38.297 --> 30:39.590
- Okay, look, you--
- But--

30:39.590 --> 30:41.300
you don't know what's gonna happen.

30:41.884 --> 30:45.262
Even if you get it right,
what'll happen to the ozone layer?

30:45.262 --> 30:46.346
You don't know.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.432
What'll happen to the oceans?
You don't know.

30:48.432 --> 30:51.185
What, the two billion people
you say you're trying to save.

30:51.185 --> 30:54.188
You're about to drop another climate
volatility event right on their heads.

30:54.188 --> 30:55.480
How does that help?

30:55.480 --> 30:59.651
<i>But the real reckless experiment
is the one civilization has been running.</i>

30:59.651 --> 31:04.531
<i>You know, adding carbon to the atmosphere,
adding plastic to the ocean.</i>

31:04.531 --> 31:07.409
<i>Removing species from ecosystems.</i>

31:07.409 --> 31:10.037
Nobody was trying to change the climate.

31:10.037 --> 31:12.497
We didn't even think
that we had that capacity.

31:12.497 --> 31:14.625
We didn't know better, but we do now.

31:14.625 --> 31:18.420
<i>And yet, human behavior doesn't change.</i>

31:19.463 --> 31:22.925
<i>The sky is easier to reengineer
than the human brain, Jon.</i>

31:22.925 --> 31:24.134
Exactly.

31:24.134 --> 31:27.804
And if you tell that greedy
monkey brain it's cooled off,

31:27.804 --> 31:29.431
and everything's okay, it's gonna say,

31:29.431 --> 31:31.767
"Give me a little bit more.
Just let me burn a little bit more.

31:31.767 --> 31:35.312
Just let me mortgage
a little more of the children's future

31:35.312 --> 31:37.731
so that I can make sure I can juice
this quarterly balance sheet.

31:37.731 --> 31:40.776
I just need that one." It's-- Gita.

31:40.776 --> 31:45.113
Gita, even if you got all of
the chemical interactions right.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.823
If you got the dispersal pattern right.

31:46.823 --> 31:50.577
The problem here is bigger
than the heat of the sun, Gita.

31:50.577 --> 31:53.163
It's the way we see the world.

31:53.664 --> 31:56.542
And you alone
up in a plane with this technology,

31:56.542 --> 32:00.754
- this is not gonna solve the problem.
- Yeah, so says the problem.

32:02.297 --> 32:03.674
Rowan?

32:05.968 --> 32:07.427
That's my son.

32:09.096 --> 32:11.265
Please tell me
that you're not up there with her.

32:11.265 --> 32:13.517
- I'm not gonna tell you that, Dad.
- Oh, God.

32:15.727 --> 32:18.605
What? Gita, what are you--
what are you doing to him?

32:19.189 --> 32:21.358
- Why? Why would you involve him in this?
- I'm not.

32:21.358 --> 32:23.777
<i>She's not doing anything to me.</i>

32:23.777 --> 32:26.029
<i>She's trying to stop things
from getting worse.</i>

32:26.029 --> 32:27.364
<i>And what are you doing?</i>

32:27.364 --> 32:30.158
- Going to another conference?
- I haven't talked to him in months.

32:30.158 --> 32:31.869
<i>Setting another goal then moving the goal?</i>

32:31.869 --> 32:34.121
<i>You told me when I was six
that we had ten years left</i>

32:34.121 --> 32:35.998
- before the feedback loops.
- He's under her in--

32:35.998 --> 32:37.374
<i>I'm 22 now.</i>

32:37.374 --> 32:38.709
This is about her, it's not him.

32:38.709 --> 32:40.794
<i>You know this is the only way.</i>

32:43.297 --> 32:46.049
<i>Jonathan, I can see the shore now.</i>

32:46.884 --> 32:49.970
<i>And the last time I was here was with you.
Do you remember?</i>

32:50.637 --> 32:53.348
<i>We were bringing battery tech to Badlapur.</i>

32:53.849 --> 32:55.517
- My mother was there.
- She's gonna do it.

32:55.517 --> 32:57.186
She's not talking...

32:57.186 --> 32:59.229
<i>We were going to use it
to power water pumps--</i>

33:02.858 --> 33:06.904
What was that? What happened?
Rowan? Rowan?

33:07.613 --> 33:09.531
Why-- What did you do?

33:10.324 --> 33:11.825
- Just a flyby.
- A flyby?

33:11.825 --> 33:14.369
But then why did we lose contact?
Why can't we hear them?

33:14.369 --> 33:17.206
We don't know who else
they're working with. We had to jam them.

33:17.206 --> 33:18.707
Are you out of your mind? We--

33:19.875 --> 33:22.169
We've gotta talk to them.
I know he's--

33:22.169 --> 33:24.463
How do we know where his allegiances lie,
Madam President?

33:24.463 --> 33:26.798
- He could be working for them.
- What did you say? What?

33:26.798 --> 33:28.967
Hold on.
He came here of his own volition.

33:28.967 --> 33:31.178
He alerted us.
You just heard what he said.

33:31.178 --> 33:35.098
I'm the one who dialed you up
and let you know what was going on.

33:35.098 --> 33:37.017
He's well beyond
his security clearance here,

33:37.017 --> 33:38.435
- Madam President.
- You don't-- Come on.

33:38.435 --> 33:40.395
I'm one of the only people
who understands

33:40.395 --> 33:41.647
what the fuck is going on up there.

33:41.647 --> 33:43.315
I'm afraid I need to ask you
to step outside.

33:45.442 --> 33:48.111
If I can talk to him,
he really can be a help.

33:48.904 --> 33:51.532
He has influence with her-- Trust me.

33:51.532 --> 33:53.700
- He's not a kid. He--
- Let's go.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.702
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- Please.

33:55.702 --> 33:57.037
Please, Rowan, if you can hear me,

33:57.037 --> 33:59.623
there's a--
there's a better way to do this, man.

33:59.623 --> 34:00.749
Okay, let's go.

34:02.209 --> 34:04.294
Am I under arrest?
I mean, I'm in the fucking closet.

34:04.294 --> 34:07.297
You are here until this is resolved.
If I were you, I'd work on calming down.

34:07.297 --> 34:09.591
Okay, I'm sorry, but I need to be
in the room with the president.

34:09.591 --> 34:11.092
- You blew that.
- Something's way off.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.344
Gita's talking two million tons
of calcium carbonate. She's only--

34:13.344 --> 34:15.097
- I've gotta go.
- Can I get my phone?

34:15.097 --> 34:17.391
- No.
- Can I get a piece of paper and a pencil?

34:17.391 --> 34:20.101
Seriously, let me work on something.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.103
- Fine.
- Okay.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.568
Our people at Langley
confirm it is possible

34:27.568 --> 34:31.362
that the planes are rigged to release
if we take her out of the sky.

34:31.362 --> 34:34.533
So, that's ten planes loaded
with calcium carbonate?

34:34.533 --> 34:36.702
- Yes, Madam President.
- Worst-case?

34:36.702 --> 34:38.203
What Chopin said.

34:38.203 --> 34:40.914
The estimate from NASA
is localized weather disruption,

34:40.914 --> 34:42.541
but the knock-on effects are unknowable.

34:42.541 --> 34:45.210
One rogue actor changes life on Earth.

34:45.835 --> 34:49.214
A flood in Shanghai, a snowstorm in Hanoi.

34:50.299 --> 34:54.511
You can see
how this can destabilize the world order.

34:54.511 --> 34:59.308
I think that's a likely knock-on effect.
And it's opening the door for others.

34:59.808 --> 35:03.103
If we do nothing, we'll look complicit.

35:03.103 --> 35:05.355
I think we need to act now.

35:07.608 --> 35:09.651
What if her gambit ends up helping?

35:09.651 --> 35:11.737
Helping? Helping what?

35:12.613 --> 35:15.532
Solve a problem
that diplomacy is failing at.

35:17.534 --> 35:20.579
We're so far off Tel Aviv,
we'll be lucky to keep it under 2.5,

35:20.579 --> 35:23.081
even three degrees
by the end of the century.

35:23.081 --> 35:25.083
You wanna talk about those ramifications?

35:26.084 --> 35:28.462
Madam President,
you're wanted on the phone.

35:28.462 --> 35:29.588
Not right now.

35:29.588 --> 35:31.340
I think you wanna take this.

35:32.424 --> 35:33.926
Can we have the room?

36:16.844 --> 36:20.389
- Hands in the air!
- Freeze! Don't move!

36:21.306 --> 36:22.850
Stay where you are.

36:23.392 --> 36:24.935
Keep your hands up!

36:27.479 --> 36:29.940
It's a hologram.
Where the fuck is he?

36:37.239 --> 36:39.950
I don't know how long we have
before they jam us again.

36:41.118 --> 36:45.497
They sent a woman to collect me.
I guess I should be flattered.

36:45.497 --> 36:47.082
At least it's not a drone.

36:47.082 --> 36:48.709
<i>What is she doing?</i>

36:49.376 --> 36:51.378
- She's pointing?
- At what?

36:51.378 --> 36:54.423
Down. She wants me to land.

36:56.258 --> 36:57.426
Are you okay?

36:58.719 --> 37:00.179
Yeah.

37:00.179 --> 37:02.973
Guy next to me just got obliterated
by some aliens, though.

37:04.516 --> 37:07.436
She probably only has enough fuel
for a few more minutes.

37:07.436 --> 37:11.064
<i>Likely from a carrier in the Persian Gulf,
she's just there to scare you.</i>

37:11.064 --> 37:12.566
Well, she's doing that.

37:16.695 --> 37:17.905
Maybe we've done enough now,

37:17.905 --> 37:20.073
shown them that anyone
with the resources can--

37:20.073 --> 37:24.703
If someone shoots me down,
you must promise to go ahead.

37:24.703 --> 37:26.121
You need to promise me that.

37:26.121 --> 37:27.998
<i>It doesn't have to be you. It doesn't.</i>

37:27.998 --> 37:31.210
The President will meet with you.
G, you can land.

37:31.210 --> 37:33.128
We can go home. They know now.

37:33.837 --> 37:37.674
<i>What your father says, it won't work.
You know that. We know that.</i>

37:44.890 --> 37:46.391
Let's call their bluff.

37:48.101 --> 37:51.522
Mr. Bilton,
I'm wondering what your awareness is

37:51.522 --> 37:53.857
around Gita Mishra's actions today.

37:53.857 --> 37:57.152
<i>Yes, Gita.
Alpha also received her demands.</i>

37:57.152 --> 38:00.948
Well, I thought so,
and as you and I have discussed,

38:01.615 --> 38:05.494
my own feelings about geoengineering
are very aligned with yours.

38:05.494 --> 38:08.664
<i>Well, it's a pity the rest
of the world doesn't agree with it.</i>

38:09.748 --> 38:12.501
<i>Another problem looking for a solution.</i>

38:12.501 --> 38:14.795
Well, we have planes
in the air, Mr. Bilton,

38:14.795 --> 38:16.922
but I can't help but wonder

38:17.965 --> 38:22.177
if there isn't a way of resolving this
outside of official channels.

38:23.178 --> 38:26.765
Are you familiar with the term
"cover for action"?

38:27.933 --> 38:29.393
<i>Interesting turn of phrase.</i>

38:30.310 --> 38:34.982
<i>I'm sure the scrutiny you face
limits your options, Madam President.</i>

38:42.114 --> 38:43.115
Madam President?

38:44.408 --> 38:46.118
You know what they call this desk?

38:46.785 --> 38:49.079
The Resolute desk was a gift

38:49.079 --> 38:54.209
from Queen Victoria in 1880 made
from the timbers of the HMS Resolute.

38:55.419 --> 38:58.422
You know what happened
to the HMS Resolute?

38:59.047 --> 39:00.215
I don't, Madam.

39:01.175 --> 39:06.930
Was abandoned in the Arctic ice
in 1854 in Melville Sound off of Alaska.

39:09.224 --> 39:11.310
Stuck in place.

39:16.190 --> 39:19.735
There's not any ice there anymore,
hadn't been for 20 years.

39:22.988 --> 39:24.656
You know, when I first got here I--

39:25.741 --> 39:30.662
I thought they gave the President
this desk to inspire them to be tough.

39:33.749 --> 39:37.169
Now I feel like it's to prepare them
for being trapped.

39:38.337 --> 39:40.464
AFRICOM is waiting for your order.

39:42.758 --> 39:44.301
How old is the kid again?

39:45.594 --> 39:47.930
Rowan Chopin is 22, Madam.

40:09.284 --> 40:10.744
But that's not possible. That--

40:13.121 --> 40:16.416
I need to speak to the President.
Or Secretary Garrett.

40:16.416 --> 40:18.794
Get someone, please.
They're gonna want to see this.

40:28.178 --> 40:30.138
Last time I spoke to President Burdick,

40:30.931 --> 40:33.517
she told me she thought
this was the best way forward.

40:33.517 --> 40:36.687
<i>Better for business. Better for humanity.</i>

40:36.687 --> 40:38.605
Why didn't she do it herself then?

40:40.107 --> 40:43.360
Because everybody wants the result,
nobody wants to take the risk.

40:43.861 --> 40:46.154
That's how fear runs our lives.

40:51.243 --> 40:53.203
- Ro, they're leaving.
- Who is?

40:53.203 --> 40:56.373
The Air Force. They're all gone now.

40:57.749 --> 41:01.086
I think we did it, Ro! They caved!

41:01.086 --> 41:03.505
Should I shut the other planes down?
Call them back?

41:03.505 --> 41:06.383
No. Let me contact Burdick,
see what the plan is.

41:08.260 --> 41:10.846
I think they're finally ready
to work with us.

41:11.513 --> 41:14.558
<i>We did it. We-- You did it.</i>

41:14.558 --> 41:16.310
The gamble worked. I mean...

41:17.186 --> 41:20.063
like Hemingway said,
"The world is a fine place"--

41:23.859 --> 41:25.277
Gita?

41:35.287 --> 41:36.663
Come on.

41:37.164 --> 41:39.082
- What is that?
- What?

41:39.082 --> 41:42.127
- Can't you see that light?
- That?

41:42.127 --> 41:45.756
Maybe it's the sun
and we'll all be dead in eight minutes.

41:46.423 --> 41:49.051
You come on. Come on...

41:56.767 --> 41:57.976
Gita?

42:17.746 --> 42:18.914
What was that?

42:19.957 --> 42:22.584
I thought we sent the planes back?
Why did we engage?

42:22.584 --> 42:24.086
- Wasn't us.
- Who was it?

42:24.086 --> 42:25.212
Who brought her down?

42:25.212 --> 42:26.547
I wanna know what happened, Tom.

42:26.547 --> 42:29.508
We have satellite imagery,
but it's hard to make heads or tails.

42:30.008 --> 42:32.553
Russia's blaming India.
India's blaming Pakistan.

42:32.553 --> 42:33.762
Iran's blaming the US.

42:33.762 --> 42:36.431
Maybe it was
a private military contractor.

42:36.431 --> 42:37.558
She had enemies.

42:38.267 --> 42:40.310
Dr. Chopin has something urgent to share.

42:41.103 --> 42:42.229
Send him in.

42:44.481 --> 42:46.400
I'm sorry, but I was thinking about it,

42:46.400 --> 42:49.653
and she's got us focused on ten planes
that take 250 tons each,

42:49.653 --> 42:53.407
but she mentioned two million tons
of calcium carbonate.

42:53.407 --> 42:55.617
We need to look into
how much she actually procured.

42:56.201 --> 42:58.287
If she's got anything close
to two million tons,

42:58.287 --> 43:01.206
then all this with the planes
is a performance.

43:01.206 --> 43:03.792
It's a distraction from something else.

43:03.792 --> 43:06.128
She's gotta have many more,
like, thousands more.

43:06.128 --> 43:08.213
We need to talk to Gita.

43:08.213 --> 43:10.215
I'm afraid that's not possible.

43:10.215 --> 43:11.633
What, why?

43:13.177 --> 43:14.178
What's happened?

43:14.678 --> 43:16.763
Her plane was destroyed over India.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.602
You shot her down?

43:21.602 --> 43:23.478
I can assure you it was not us.

43:25.814 --> 43:27.274
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

43:28.525 --> 43:30.110
What about my son?
Was he on the plane?

43:30.110 --> 43:31.278
We don't know.

43:31.945 --> 43:34.239
- What did you mean by "more"?
- More what, Doctor?

43:34.239 --> 43:35.324
Madam President,

43:35.324 --> 43:38.202
the other nine planes
just released their payloads.

43:39.119 --> 43:41.872
We're picking up a message
on the hailing frequency.

43:41.872 --> 43:43.582
Please.

43:43.582 --> 43:47.377
<i>"The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for." Right, Dad?</i>

43:48.295 --> 43:50.339
Gita told me it was on your desk.

43:51.256 --> 43:52.674
What the hell is he talking about?

43:52.674 --> 43:54.510
"And I hate very much to leave it."

43:54.510 --> 43:56.178
Trace his signal.

43:56.178 --> 43:58.096
"And I hate very much to leave it."

43:58.680 --> 44:00.390
<i>That's the end of that, Rowan.</i>

44:00.390 --> 44:02.684
Rowan, wherever you are
and whatever you're doing,

44:02.684 --> 44:04.728
just stop it. Stop it!

44:05.354 --> 44:07.397
<i>Just step back from it, pal.</i>

44:07.397 --> 44:10.442
I'm doing what Gita taught me,
what you taught me.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.444
<i>Mount Pinatubo.</i>

44:12.444 --> 44:15.364
No. No, you need to come home.

44:15.364 --> 44:18.617
You need to come home and turn yourself in
before you get hurt, Rowan.

44:18.617 --> 44:21.787
I cannot listen to you get hurt.

44:22.788 --> 44:25.874
You can't fight for the world
if you're not here, pal.

44:28.085 --> 44:29.461
She told me, Dad.

44:29.962 --> 44:31.922
She told me about the book she gave you.

44:32.422 --> 44:34.800
"We are as gods,
and we might as well get good at it."

44:34.800 --> 44:36.718
<i>That's what the book said, right?</i>

44:37.344 --> 44:40.389
No, no. We're not gods.

44:40.931 --> 44:43.809
None of us. Not Gita, not you, not me.

44:43.809 --> 44:47.479
We're just parents and children.
Please come home. Just come home.

44:52.985 --> 44:54.653
It's too late now, Dad.

45:02.703 --> 45:04.246
The line's gone dead.

45:10.669 --> 45:11.670
It's go time.

45:21.972 --> 45:27.477
Release. Release. Release.

45:28.687 --> 45:31.106
Release. Release. Release.

45:34.902 --> 45:36.195
Release.

45:49.708 --> 45:51.043
What the hell?

46:02.804 --> 46:04.640
What is going on?

46:05.682 --> 46:06.892
Oh, my...

46:06.892 --> 46:10.270
There are reports of dispersals
everywhere, Madam President.

46:11.480 --> 46:12.731
They used drones.

46:14.149 --> 46:16.276
Thousands of Alpha delivery drones.

47:29.766 --> 47:31.476
What's gonna happen now?

47:35.063 --> 47:36.273
I don't know.

47:38.108 --> 47:39.610
Nobody does.
