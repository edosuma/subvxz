00:12.004 --> 00:14.289
It's my turn. Watch out!

00:14.314 --> 00:16.389
I'm too fast.
I'm going to get you!

00:16.414 --> 00:18.139
No, you're not! Oi!

00:18.164 --> 00:20.389
Rebecca, Danny, come on.
Stop it.

00:20.414 --> 00:22.749
Right, folks, dinner's served.

00:34.124 --> 00:36.648
Mmm... Not now.

00:42.004 --> 00:45.778
Did you stop for a kebab
on the way?

00:45.803 --> 00:47.859
No, no, no. Food's fine.

00:47.884 --> 00:51.568
Just... Just not much of
an appetite, that's all.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.698
I hope you're not coming
down with something. No.

00:54.723 --> 00:57.929
Can I get you anything, Pat? Do
you want to lie down? - No, he's fine.

00:57.954 --> 00:59.568
Aren't you?

00:59.593 --> 01:01.139
Yeah.

01:02.204 --> 01:03.539
Fine. Fine.

01:12.694 --> 01:14.390
That's the lot.

01:16.894 --> 01:18.789
Are you OK, Mum?

01:18.814 --> 01:21.080
Yeah. I'm all right.
I'm all right.

01:21.105 --> 01:23.619
- Mum, you're crying.
- I'm OK. I'm just tired.

01:25.495 --> 01:29.110
It's just...everything
is so complicated.

01:29.135 --> 01:30.749
OK. What is?

01:30.774 --> 01:32.619
We want dessert!

01:32.644 --> 01:35.260
- Now back to the table, please. Now!
- It's all right.

01:35.285 --> 01:36.619
Come on, children.

01:36.644 --> 01:40.830
Let's see if we can find where your
daddy has stashed the ice cream.

01:40.855 --> 01:41.999
Is it in here?

01:48.415 --> 01:50.440
It's been a pleasure.
Thanks for having me.

01:50.465 --> 01:52.190
Thanks. You're welcome.

01:52.215 --> 01:54.150
See you soon. Night.

01:59.175 --> 02:00.799
Thanks for dinner.

02:00.824 --> 02:02.549
You're welcome.

02:02.574 --> 02:06.260
I'll drive. I've only had two
glasses. You've had three.

02:06.285 --> 02:09.080
What, you were counting?
You certainly weren't.

02:09.104 --> 02:11.749
- I know when I've had enough.
- So do I.

02:13.495 --> 02:15.030
Oh...

02:16.255 --> 02:17.830
Dad?

02:19.335 --> 02:21.590
Sorry, Leslie. Sorry about that.

02:21.615 --> 02:25.080
You know if you ever need to
talk to me about anything... Les...

02:25.105 --> 02:26.950
...I'm always here for you.

02:38.615 --> 02:40.510
Where are the kids?

02:40.535 --> 02:42.190
They're upstairs.

03:42.115 --> 03:43.890
Come on, back here.

03:46.445 --> 03:48.210
Jack Hodgson.

03:48.235 --> 03:50.370
DI Quint's expecting me.

03:50.395 --> 03:51.779
Thank you.

04:05.595 --> 04:08.570
Thank you. Thanks.

04:08.595 --> 04:12.140
According to DI Quint over there,
no-one's claimed responsibility.

04:12.165 --> 04:15.570
Nor does the deceased's
background show any indication

04:15.595 --> 04:17.529
of a terrorist connection.

04:17.553 --> 04:19.810
Any secondary devices detected?

04:19.834 --> 04:21.089
No, none.

04:21.115 --> 04:24.570
SCD's decided a homicide team
should carry out the investigation.

04:24.595 --> 04:26.930
No pedestrians around,
other than the family.

04:26.955 --> 04:28.970
The only fatality is the driver.

04:28.995 --> 04:31.420
We're just waiting for
the final go-ahead.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.290
Right, let's go to work.

04:34.674 --> 04:37.290
According to the family,
the bomb went off

04:37.315 --> 04:38.970
when she opened the door.

04:42.995 --> 04:47.700
The blast threw the victim
3 metres 42 centimetres.

04:48.835 --> 04:51.140
The victim is female.

04:51.165 --> 04:54.649
Severe burn damage
to most of the body.

04:54.674 --> 04:57.060
Skin and flesh torn off in pieces.

04:57.085 --> 04:59.010
Death would have been instantaneous.

04:59.035 --> 05:00.729
She never knew what hit her.

05:02.085 --> 05:03.649
The centre of the blast

05:03.674 --> 05:07.420
seems to have been directly
beneath the driver's seat.

05:07.445 --> 05:10.580
Looks very much like an
improvised explosive device.

05:15.085 --> 05:18.609
Damage to the wall, the trees,

05:18.634 --> 05:21.370
combined with the wide
blast radius

05:21.395 --> 05:23.940
indicates quite a powerful
explosion.

05:23.965 --> 05:26.010
Any idea what kind of bomb it was?

05:26.035 --> 05:27.609
Too early to tell.

05:27.634 --> 05:31.890
The DSTL officers must locate every
scrap of the device they can find,

05:31.915 --> 05:34.250
then we piece it together bit by bit.

05:39.035 --> 05:43.250
Thank you all very much now
for coming here this morning.

05:43.275 --> 05:47.700
I'm very proud to announce
the opening of two new offices

05:47.725 --> 05:50.940
on behalf of the Lawson Advisory Group.

05:50.965 --> 05:54.580
We're talking about the
creation of nearly 200 jobs.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.859
One of the offices will
be here in London,

05:57.884 --> 06:00.779
and the other office will
be in Belfast,

06:00.804 --> 06:03.859
and I'm pleased to say that the
Belfast office will be headed up

06:03.884 --> 06:06.420
by my daughter Geraldine.
- Thank you, Dad.

06:06.445 --> 06:09.500
Although we advise banks and
financial institutions worldwide,

06:09.525 --> 06:11.890
Northern Ireland is where we're from.

06:11.915 --> 06:14.609
Has the current economic
situation in Northern Ireland

06:14.634 --> 06:17.700
affected your decision in any way?
- Only in a very positive way.

06:17.725 --> 06:21.649
We're a British company, and proudly so.

06:21.674 --> 06:24.859
Thank you all very much. Thank
you for coming. Mr Lawson!

06:34.605 --> 06:37.170
Mind if I smoke, Mr Lawson?

06:37.195 --> 06:40.060
Hmph! You don't have
to ask every time, Craig.

06:42.165 --> 06:44.729
OK. We've a 7:30 with
the fiscal committee

06:44.754 --> 06:46.700
and then at 9:50...

06:46.725 --> 06:48.529
We may win a battle...

06:49.804 --> 06:53.250
...but eventually we will lose the war.

06:53.275 --> 06:55.370
What are you talking about, Dad?

06:57.325 --> 06:59.170
Ah, nothing.

06:59.195 --> 07:02.060
Just the rumblings of an old man.

07:03.355 --> 07:06.060
When old men rumble, I listen. Hmm...

07:09.475 --> 07:11.500
These last 20 years...

07:12.915 --> 07:14.580
...business has grown.

07:14.605 --> 07:16.940
Borders have just disappeared.

07:16.965 --> 07:18.970
Everyone, including me,

07:18.995 --> 07:21.500
has been so busy getting on...

07:22.754 --> 07:24.450
...as to forget the past.

07:24.475 --> 07:25.970
Forget the dead.

07:27.325 --> 07:29.370
Nothing has been forgotten, Dad.

07:29.395 --> 07:31.250
Sometimes I wonder...

07:31.275 --> 07:33.890
...have we settled for peace too soon?

07:46.275 --> 07:48.609
Don't worry. Grandad's fine.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.420
We'll all be downstairs in a bit, OK?

07:51.445 --> 07:53.970
We appreciate the shock
you must be feeling,

07:53.995 --> 07:56.609
but we will need to ask
you some questions.

08:00.245 --> 08:02.690
Did Mrs Walsh have any enemies?

08:04.115 --> 08:05.779
No, none.

08:05.804 --> 08:08.659
No-one who might want
to do her harm?

08:08.684 --> 08:10.380
Is that some kind of a joke?

08:10.405 --> 08:12.250
My mum was a primary school teacher.

08:12.275 --> 08:14.250
Who'd want to blow her up?

08:14.275 --> 08:16.330
Mr Walsh?

08:16.355 --> 08:18.940
Your wife normally drive, or did you?

08:20.554 --> 08:23.609
I did. But not last night?

08:26.275 --> 08:29.300
She said that I had one too many.

08:29.325 --> 08:31.940
In other words,
under normal circumstances,

08:31.965 --> 08:35.759
you would have been the one
behind the wheel? - Wait a minute.

08:35.784 --> 08:37.440
What are you trying to ask here?

08:37.465 --> 08:40.710
We're just trying to
establish the facts, Mr Walsh.

08:40.735 --> 08:42.600
This is insane.

08:43.703 --> 08:46.190
My mother was just murdered.

08:46.215 --> 08:47.990
In front of our eyes.

08:48.015 --> 08:50.600
Why are you not out
there trying to find them?

08:50.625 --> 08:52.320
I can't breathe in here.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.600
Sir, you can't be in here.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.270
Oh...

09:09.295 --> 09:11.879
Of course. I'll get out of your hair...

09:11.904 --> 09:13.080
Steady.

09:13.105 --> 09:15.400
Steady. Are you all right? Oh...

09:15.425 --> 09:17.600
Thanks.

09:19.185 --> 09:21.240
Is that a Belfast accent I detect?

09:21.265 --> 09:22.879
Aye.

09:22.904 --> 09:24.549
What's left of it.

09:24.574 --> 09:26.710
You take the accent out of Belfast...

09:28.704 --> 09:30.480
You find anything?

09:30.505 --> 09:32.679
You know who might have done this?

09:32.704 --> 09:36.120
DI Quint will be in touch as
soon as we know anything more.

09:47.095 --> 09:50.759
I'd like you to think back to the
evening before the explosion.

09:53.425 --> 09:55.679
Did anything unusual happen?

09:55.704 --> 09:57.480
Anything out the ordinary?

10:01.375 --> 10:03.240
It was just...

10:03.265 --> 10:05.070
...a normal Sunday dinner,

10:05.095 --> 10:06.400
and then...

10:07.625 --> 10:08.799
Oh, God.

10:10.425 --> 10:11.910
It's all right.

10:14.545 --> 10:17.160
Mum and Dad did
seem a bit on edge.

10:17.185 --> 10:19.629
Why was that?

10:21.185 --> 10:23.990
Just making a big deal
out of nothing.

10:26.505 --> 10:28.879
I did see Mum crying
in the kitchen.

10:30.904 --> 10:33.160
Did she tell you
why she was crying?

10:34.654 --> 10:36.879
But, you know, I know them both.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.799
Something wasn't right.

10:40.985 --> 10:42.520
Excuse me.

10:55.704 --> 10:57.400
Mr Walsh?

11:10.704 --> 11:12.559
Has he gone?

11:23.784 --> 11:26.920
No way that old fella could
climb over that, could he?

11:57.225 --> 11:59.200
Oh, no...

12:24.375 --> 12:26.429
Something's happened to him.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.629
Any idea why your father would run?

12:28.654 --> 12:30.530
He's not running.

12:30.555 --> 12:32.120
He's confused.

12:32.145 --> 12:34.639
Anybody would be
after what just happened.

12:36.865 --> 12:39.679
I'll need DNA samples
from you and your children.

12:39.704 --> 12:41.280
What?

12:41.305 --> 12:42.960
Seriously?

12:42.985 --> 12:44.990
You think we're involved?

12:45.015 --> 12:47.400
Purely for purposes of elimination.

12:51.225 --> 12:53.070
Issue an alert for Patrick Walsh.

12:53.095 --> 12:55.200
Ping his mobile for a
possible location.

13:17.065 --> 13:18.639
Hello?

13:19.834 --> 13:21.429
Who got to you?

13:36.375 --> 13:40.040
Right, you little bastard,
let's find out who you are.

13:45.735 --> 13:48.040
Goody.

13:48.065 --> 13:50.360
I love puzzles.

13:50.385 --> 13:53.480
Personally, I'm more of
a Pictionary man.

13:57.584 --> 13:58.960
Oh...

13:58.985 --> 14:01.250
Found this near the house.

14:01.275 --> 14:04.400
Initially, I thought it was the
receiver of the detonation signal.

14:04.425 --> 14:06.480
Then it'd be even more damaged.

14:06.505 --> 14:08.170
Disintegrated, even.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.040
It could belong to the victim. Hmm.

14:13.704 --> 14:15.250
Morning.

14:15.275 --> 14:18.679
Comparisons with
antemortem dental records

14:18.704 --> 14:21.889
confirm the victim is
indeed Olivia Walsh.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.559
Torso, arms and legs
charred due to burn damage.

14:26.584 --> 14:29.170
The skin is intact in some places,

14:29.195 --> 14:30.480
but...

14:32.065 --> 14:33.720
Fractures of the ribs,

14:33.745 --> 14:35.610
ruptures of the eye globes.

14:36.815 --> 14:38.920
Oh! Want to have a look at this?

14:40.584 --> 14:42.480
See what you think.

14:43.555 --> 14:45.790
Looks like a crystal of some sort.

14:46.914 --> 14:48.720
Any idea what it is?

14:48.745 --> 14:50.480
No.

14:50.505 --> 14:52.200
We don't know.

14:54.635 --> 14:56.250
Get it tested.

14:56.275 --> 14:58.610
Nikki, do you have anything? Yeah.

15:01.225 --> 15:04.530
The lungs show areas of contusion.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.360
So does the liver.

15:10.704 --> 15:13.080
Transection of the aorta.

15:13.105 --> 15:14.559
Yeah.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.120
Lamellar haemorrhages of the colon.

15:19.584 --> 15:21.720
Tears of the mesentery.

15:21.745 --> 15:24.639
All consistent with
characteristics of blast injury.

15:30.464 --> 15:32.480
Any idea what it is yet?

15:32.505 --> 15:34.790
Crystallised ammonium nitrate.

15:35.945 --> 15:37.840
Part of the explosive?

15:37.865 --> 15:41.360
Semtex is often used as a
booster for ammonium nitrate -

15:41.385 --> 15:45.150
and the making of nitrates was
severely restricted in the mid-'80s.

15:45.175 --> 15:46.759
Bomb-makers used the technique

15:46.784 --> 15:48.889
of extracting nitrates
from fertilisers.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.790
Nitrates that have been subjected
to this extracting method

15:51.815 --> 15:53.280
crystallise in a certain way.

15:53.305 --> 15:55.840
The nitrate fertiliser method

15:55.865 --> 16:00.000
is a recurring feature of
handmade IEDs.

16:04.784 --> 16:08.759
Semen was found on Olivia
Walsh's intimate swabs.

16:08.784 --> 16:12.480
Pat Walsh's DNA doesn't
match the sample.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.000
She was sleeping with
someone other than her husband

16:15.025 --> 16:16.720
within the last three days.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.439
Da, it's me.

16:34.464 --> 16:36.530
What brings you here?

16:36.555 --> 16:38.970
Does a son need a reason
to see his father?

16:38.995 --> 16:41.689
- No, but my son does.
- Uh-huh.

16:41.714 --> 16:43.360
- Who died?
- Nobody died.

16:44.555 --> 16:46.050
Nobody we know.

16:58.355 --> 17:00.920
A case today brought
back some old memories.

17:00.945 --> 17:02.330
Good or bad ones?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.920
Both, I guess.

17:05.464 --> 17:07.769
How old would she be now?

17:09.794 --> 17:12.920
She was, what, eight
years younger than you?

17:19.075 --> 17:22.329
This morning, when I saw
that blast scene...

17:22.355 --> 17:24.970
...it all came back
like it was yesterday.

17:33.435 --> 17:35.970
I'm sorry, Da. I didn't... 62.

17:38.305 --> 17:40.639
She'd be 62.

17:42.464 --> 17:45.000
Her birthday's March the 21st.

17:45.025 --> 17:46.920
Yeah. I know.

17:56.914 --> 18:00.250
- How long have we got to stay here?
- Until forensics have finished

18:00.275 --> 18:02.889
examining the house and surroundings.

18:02.914 --> 18:05.889
- When will that be?
- I will tell you as soon as I know.

18:05.914 --> 18:09.330
If you need anything,
if you'd like to talk,

18:09.355 --> 18:11.639
or if you think of something
that might be pertinent,

18:11.664 --> 18:13.439
I'm here for you. Thanks.

18:15.635 --> 18:18.160
"Pat Walsh here. Leave a message."

18:23.794 --> 18:25.610
This isn't like Dad.

18:27.515 --> 18:29.280
Something's wrong.

18:29.305 --> 18:31.530
Men like your father,
they're old school.

18:31.555 --> 18:33.769
He probably doesn't want to
share his grief.

18:33.794 --> 18:35.689
He wants to be left alone.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.970
What's he going to do without Mum?

18:39.275 --> 18:42.080
When she went in for
appendicitis last year,

18:42.105 --> 18:44.490
he was so worried he
practically stopped eating.

18:44.515 --> 18:46.490
Your dad is tougher than you think.

18:48.355 --> 18:50.769
I should go round to their house.

18:50.794 --> 18:52.439
Maybe he's there.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.280
Can you wait till the evening,
when the kids have gone to bed?

19:03.435 --> 19:06.130
None of this makes any sense.

19:07.385 --> 19:09.080
None of it.

19:10.225 --> 19:12.000
It's OK.

19:12.995 --> 19:14.889
It's all going to be all right.

19:21.185 --> 19:23.000
Any progress on the phone?

19:23.025 --> 19:25.490
The SIM card was severely damaged,

19:25.515 --> 19:28.080
but it does belong to Olivia Walsh.

19:28.105 --> 19:31.050
Her service provider's given
us a list of calls

19:31.075 --> 19:32.800
and text messages.

19:32.825 --> 19:35.439
Most of it is just shopping
lists and chatter,

19:35.464 --> 19:37.280
but three weeks ago,

19:37.305 --> 19:39.410
a new number enters the picture.

19:39.435 --> 19:41.360
"Nice to meet you today.

19:41.385 --> 19:43.519
"Hopefully we can have
another chat soon."

19:43.544 --> 19:45.360
And did they?

19:45.385 --> 19:47.250
Two days later.

19:48.435 --> 19:50.280
"Had a lovely time."

19:50.305 --> 19:51.769
Sounds innocuous to me.

19:51.794 --> 19:53.720
But it's signed kiss, kiss, kiss.

19:55.584 --> 19:58.639
What about the number
that sent the text?

19:58.664 --> 20:02.490
It's registered to the
Hyde Park Mini-Marathon -

20:02.515 --> 20:04.519
an annual charity race.

20:04.544 --> 20:06.360
I'll tell Quint.

20:09.025 --> 20:12.160
They have a few phones
allocated to volunteers.

20:12.185 --> 20:15.569
Any records of who would have
this phone on the day in question?

20:15.594 --> 20:18.610
No, but they do have a list of
people who volunteered that day.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.970
Let's split up. Door-to-door time.

20:23.794 --> 20:26.720
- Got anything?
- No, sir, not yet.

20:26.745 --> 20:29.280
- Three left.
- OK. Let me know.

20:29.305 --> 20:31.280
"Hello?"

20:31.305 --> 20:33.160
Mr Alex Harris? Yeah.

20:33.185 --> 20:35.519
I'm DC Anderton.

20:37.305 --> 20:39.800
- Can I have a word, please?
- Yeah. Sure.

20:44.914 --> 20:48.970
Hi. Mr Harris,
do you know this woman?

20:48.995 --> 20:51.800
That's Olivia.

20:51.825 --> 20:53.569
Is she all right?

20:55.385 --> 20:58.080
Can I come in and
ask you a few questions?

20:58.105 --> 21:01.430
- Sure, but I've got...
- It won't take long.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.630
Yeah. Come on in.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.510
Sir, I've located the user of the phone.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.459
Mr Alex Harris.

21:12.335 --> 21:14.459
I met Olivia in the park.

21:14.484 --> 21:17.510
I run there regularly, so
I see her all the time -

21:17.535 --> 21:20.911
and occasionally, I volunteer for
the Hyde Park Mini-Marathon.

21:22.703 --> 21:24.959
Mr Harris? Oh...

21:28.944 --> 21:31.428
Yeah. So I suggested
that she take part.

21:31.453 --> 21:34.869
What kind of relationship do
you have with Olivia Walsh?

21:34.894 --> 21:37.319
I just told you, didn't I?

21:39.014 --> 21:42.839
If you agree to it, Mr Harris, I'd
like to take reference mouth swabs.

21:42.864 --> 21:46.039
I'll agree to it if you tell
me what this is about.

21:46.064 --> 21:48.709
Olivia Walsh is dead.

21:49.864 --> 21:51.869
She was murdered.

21:53.533 --> 21:56.069
H ow? Her car exploded.

22:00.174 --> 22:03.119
The car bomb that was on
the news this morning?

22:03.144 --> 22:05.349
No rush, Mr Harris.

22:05.374 --> 22:07.069
Put out your tongue.

22:07.094 --> 22:10.399
I can tell you what
you're going to find.

22:14.254 --> 22:16.039
We had sex.

22:16.064 --> 22:18.319
Maybe three times.

22:19.344 --> 22:21.508
She was lonely and she had issues.

22:23.424 --> 22:25.349
What kind of issues?

22:25.374 --> 22:27.249
No idea.

22:27.274 --> 22:30.119
Olivia initiated the affair.

22:31.304 --> 22:34.279
Although she didn't seem
to really enjoy herself.

22:34.304 --> 22:36.709
I know it sounds bizarre.

22:36.734 --> 22:40.199
It was almost as if she was doing
it because she felt she had to.

22:40.224 --> 22:42.678
She felt compelled to
have sex with you?

22:42.703 --> 22:44.839
I know it seems strange.

22:46.703 --> 22:49.399
When was the last time
you had sex with Mrs Walsh?

22:50.734 --> 22:52.789
Three days ago.

22:54.384 --> 22:56.839
After, she said it would
be the last time.

22:56.864 --> 22:58.399
Mr Harris...

22:59.634 --> 23:02.039
...where were you on the
night of Sunday the 15th

23:02.064 --> 23:03.638
between the hours of 6pm and 9pm?

23:04.894 --> 23:07.119
I was in my office working late.

23:08.254 --> 23:11.249
I run an architectural
firm, so I often work late.

23:11.274 --> 23:12.869
Alone.

23:14.504 --> 23:16.609
We're going to need your mobile,

23:16.634 --> 23:19.758
and to check your offices.

23:19.783 --> 23:21.758
Yeah.

23:21.783 --> 23:23.479
Yeah, sure.

23:47.344 --> 23:49.119
Dad?

23:51.504 --> 23:53.558
Dad?

24:17.944 --> 24:19.789
Oh!

24:27.713 --> 24:29.479
Thanks.

24:49.944 --> 24:52.079
Where's the body?

24:52.104 --> 24:54.719
It's not been located yet.

24:54.744 --> 24:58.558
The amount of blood loss and
the blood trail by the door,

24:58.583 --> 25:01.329
I think it's highly unlikely
the victim walked away.

25:13.104 --> 25:15.199
Signs of a struggle.

25:19.254 --> 25:21.199
Which moved to here.

25:26.894 --> 25:29.508
The appearance and
distribution of the blood

25:29.533 --> 25:33.758
could suggest impact spatter from
some form of blunt-force trauma...

25:35.744 --> 25:39.688
...with the victim probably
in a standing position.

25:41.713 --> 25:44.479
Possible arterial bleeding,

25:44.504 --> 25:46.999
the victim close to the floor.

25:48.254 --> 25:49.839
No...

25:52.783 --> 25:55.589
Looks like expirated spatter.

25:57.184 --> 25:59.919
Then the victim is moved across the floor.

25:59.944 --> 26:01.558
Yeah...

26:11.384 --> 26:13.359
...but only as far as here.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.768
What then?

26:19.793 --> 26:23.638
Victim's lifted from the floor,
transferred into or onto something?

26:23.663 --> 26:25.479
There was a second car.

26:26.583 --> 26:28.869
Five-year-old dark-blue hatchback.

26:28.894 --> 26:31.079
Neighbours said they saw
the car drive away

26:31.104 --> 26:33.589
and return yesterday
afternoon. Take a look? Come on.

27:16.154 --> 27:17.719
What's wrong, Dan?

27:17.744 --> 27:19.558
I want to go home.

27:19.583 --> 27:24.049
I know, but we've just got to
stay at the hotel a little bit longer.

27:24.074 --> 27:26.079
I'll never see Polar Bear.

27:26.104 --> 27:28.969
Polar Bear is going to
be waiting at the house

27:28.994 --> 27:30.879
nice and safe when you get back.

27:30.904 --> 27:33.489
No, he's not,

27:33.514 --> 27:36.949
because we're never going home
again. Of course we are, baby.

27:36.974 --> 27:40.719
How about, when we get back the hotel,

27:40.744 --> 27:43.688
you get to pick a cool film to watch,

27:43.713 --> 27:46.359
and he will be there when we get back, OK?

27:46.384 --> 27:48.969
I want to see Polar Bear...

27:48.994 --> 27:50.489
I know you do.

27:55.154 --> 27:57.329
How's it all coming along?

27:58.583 --> 28:02.329
The DNA profiles obtained from the
blood samples in Pat Walsh's house

28:02.354 --> 28:04.129
all match Pat Walsh himself.

28:04.154 --> 28:05.849
Toxicology?

28:05.874 --> 28:09.049
Toxicology shows presence of
gemcitabine and capecitabine

28:09.074 --> 28:10.999
in Walsh's blood.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.919
GemCap?

28:12.944 --> 28:15.329
Cancer drugs? He was seriously ill.

28:15.354 --> 28:17.199
Also presence of warfarin,

28:17.224 --> 28:20.359
so maybe blood clots or
a heart condition as well.

28:20.384 --> 28:23.599
His GP might have more
information. I'll check it out.

28:26.104 --> 28:28.209
This assault on Walsh...

28:28.234 --> 28:30.999
...it feels different
from the bomb attack.

28:31.024 --> 28:33.799
It feels savage. Impulsive. Personal.

28:33.824 --> 28:37.719
Whereas the bomb attack was
meticulously planned and executed.

28:37.744 --> 28:39.359
At a distance from the victim.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.518
Might suggest two
different perpetrators.

29:11.713 --> 29:13.279
Anything? Nope.

29:14.663 --> 29:16.849
Car's just been cleaned,
it's spotless.

29:19.904 --> 29:22.919
Clarissa. Jack.

29:22.944 --> 29:27.129
The stain inside the suitcase
was blood. Pat Walsh's blood.

29:27.154 --> 29:30.638
So the suitcase could have
been used to transport the body -

29:30.663 --> 29:32.129
but where to?

29:32.154 --> 29:34.209
And why return it to the house?

29:34.234 --> 29:37.329
They also found the
remnants of packing tape

29:37.354 --> 29:40.768
impacted on the wheels
of the suitcase.

29:40.793 --> 29:44.129
The tape has a distinctive
green and white logo on it -

29:44.154 --> 29:48.799
it looks like company branding.
So I ran a few searches.

29:48.824 --> 29:50.079
Any results?

29:53.954 --> 29:56.688
Yesterday afternoon? Uh-huh. Around four?

29:57.954 --> 30:01.359
No idea, I'd have to check.
Do you need proof of identity

30:01.384 --> 30:03.929
to rent a storage unit? No.

30:03.954 --> 30:07.409
So, theoretically, you can rent
under the name of Muhammad Ali?

30:07.434 --> 30:08.409
Who's he?

30:11.713 --> 30:14.129
Does this man have a unit
rented with you?

30:16.984 --> 30:20.999
Well, I wasn't on watch, but I can
check with Zach tomorrow morning.

30:25.384 --> 30:29.079
Or, um... I can do it now.

30:29.104 --> 30:30.518
Now is good.

30:44.514 --> 30:47.719
Looks like the same suitcase as the
one from Walsh's house. Mm-hm.

30:53.384 --> 30:55.079
Exits ten minutes later.

31:17.874 --> 31:19.409
So...

31:19.434 --> 31:22.518
...you bring a suitcase and you're
not dumping anything in the unit...

31:22.543 --> 31:26.359
Taking something from the unit.
Boom-boom. What, though?

31:26.384 --> 31:27.648
Crate of cold lager?

31:37.713 --> 31:39.049
Wrapping of some kind.

31:41.074 --> 31:42.799
Trace of a serial number, maybe?

31:47.984 --> 31:50.768
He's heartbroken.

31:50.793 --> 31:53.209
How could we have forgot
his polar bear?

31:55.593 --> 31:58.929
- I'll go get it. - You will not.
We don't know what's going on.

31:58.954 --> 32:02.009
Whatever it is, has to do
with Mum and Dad, not us.

32:03.104 --> 32:06.289
Les, you're not going. I'm
going stir crazy here, Marie.

32:09.074 --> 32:11.009
I'll be OK.

32:11.034 --> 32:13.049
All right, really.

32:20.154 --> 32:23.849
Pat Walsh's GP confirms he was
a sick man, pancreatic cancer,

32:23.874 --> 32:27.438
advanced stages. He was receiving
chemo and radiation therapy.

32:27.463 --> 32:30.568
Well, that explains the GemCarb.
What about the warfarin?

32:30.593 --> 32:32.239
That's where it gets interesting.

32:32.264 --> 32:34.289
Apparently, Walsh also had
stomach ulcers -

32:34.314 --> 32:36.079
warfarin would be contraindicated.

32:36.104 --> 32:37.729
So why is it present?

32:38.954 --> 32:42.599
Well... Was Walsh endangering
his own life? Possible.

32:43.824 --> 32:46.648
Maybe someone was giving it
to him without his knowledge.

32:51.314 --> 32:54.049
I'm, er, I'm Mr Walsh. It's
my house. just need to pop in.

32:54.074 --> 32:56.438
Sorry, sir, no-one's allowed in.

32:56.463 --> 32:58.799
Um...look, it's my son's favourite toy.

32:58.824 --> 33:00.369
It's kind of an emergency,

33:00.394 --> 33:03.089
I'd just really appreciate it...
I'm sorry, sir.

33:04.543 --> 33:06.239
OK, yeah.

33:08.514 --> 33:10.089
Thanks.

33:22.184 --> 33:25.489
I measured some of the
trajectories of the blood spatter

33:25.514 --> 33:28.679
on the walls. I estimated
from the impact spatter

33:28.704 --> 33:32.318
that the initial assault was
about a foot from the wall,

33:32.343 --> 33:34.599
approximately six foot from the floor,

33:34.624 --> 33:36.729
Pat Walsh's head height.

33:36.754 --> 33:41.159
We then have what looks like
arterial bleeding down here,

33:41.184 --> 33:45.089
potentially suggesting
a change of weapon.

33:45.114 --> 33:46.929
Then, the coughed-up blood.

33:46.954 --> 33:50.599
This could correlate with
suggested injuries sustained.

33:50.624 --> 33:54.209
Now, although there
were signs of a struggle...

33:55.704 --> 33:58.799
...there were no bloodstains
between these two areas,

33:58.824 --> 34:01.289
so, from the couch
to the living room door,

34:01.314 --> 34:03.679
from the living room
door to the front entrance,

34:03.704 --> 34:05.369
he left no blood trail,

34:05.394 --> 34:09.409
despite sustaining an
arterial bleed. Not impossible.

34:09.434 --> 34:11.409
No, but it's very unusual.

34:12.672 --> 34:15.239
Right, so I analysed
the plastic fragment

34:15.264 --> 34:20.089
retrieved from the fridge
found in Walsh's storage unit.

34:20.114 --> 34:23.289
I found a possible source.

34:23.313 --> 34:26.129
A blood bag? Correct.

34:26.154 --> 34:30.568
So, Walsh possibly stores
bags of blood in the fridge?

34:30.592 --> 34:32.929
Why?

34:32.954 --> 34:34.879
Whose blood?

34:34.904 --> 34:38.768
Blood stored in blood bags needs
an anticoagulant of some sort.

34:40.154 --> 34:43.418
Toxicology found the presence
of warfarin in the blood

34:43.444 --> 34:45.418
in Walsh's house.

34:45.444 --> 34:47.958
Warfarin is a potent anticoagulant.

34:47.984 --> 34:51.768
So, Pat Walsh secretly stores
bags of his own blood? Yeah.

34:53.473 --> 34:57.809
Yesterday, Pat Walsh goes to
his storage unit with a suitcase.

34:57.834 --> 35:02.568
He transports the blood bags in
the case back to his own house,

35:02.593 --> 35:06.768
where he sprays the blood
all over his walls.

35:06.793 --> 35:09.169
Bastard staged his own death.

35:28.314 --> 35:31.209
What is going on?! Do you
know how upset we've been?

35:31.234 --> 35:34.959
I mean, losing Mum was bad
enough, but for you to just disappear...

35:39.444 --> 35:41.419
What's wrong?

35:41.444 --> 35:44.089
You OK?

35:44.114 --> 35:46.419
Yeah...I'm fine.

35:46.444 --> 35:47.959
What's wrong?

35:52.343 --> 35:53.778
Cancer.

35:55.114 --> 35:56.239
Pancreatic.

35:59.444 --> 36:01.089
I don't have much time left.

36:08.673 --> 36:10.648
Is this why Mum was upset
the other night?

36:13.343 --> 36:15.599
Yes. I need your help.

36:17.114 --> 36:19.809
- We have to do this together.
- Do what?

36:21.194 --> 36:23.089
Find the people who killed your mother.

36:25.343 --> 36:27.139
That's up to the police.

36:28.593 --> 36:30.249
You should get to a hospital.

36:30.274 --> 36:33.568
I'm going to ring Marie, she'll
pick up... She was my wife.

36:33.593 --> 36:36.528
She was your mother.
Now she deserves justice.

36:38.624 --> 36:40.039
Text Marie.

36:41.553 --> 36:44.679
Tell her you are going to take a
few days away from the family.

36:46.423 --> 36:48.039
No, I can't lie to her.

36:49.673 --> 36:51.009
She needs me -

36:51.034 --> 36:52.369
and so do the kids.

36:53.954 --> 36:55.609
She'll never believe me.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.398
Make her believe.

36:59.634 --> 37:03.089
The police and whoever is after
me think that I am dead now.

37:04.444 --> 37:06.039
Now, that buys us time.

37:08.064 --> 37:10.568
Now come on.

37:10.593 --> 37:12.318
Come on.

37:35.593 --> 37:39.859
The spiral is one of the oldest
symbols of justice in the world.

37:39.884 --> 37:42.398
Thought to belong to the
earliest settlers in Britain...

37:42.423 --> 37:45.039
This could be just random
scratchings from the explosion.

37:45.064 --> 37:48.289
Yes, it could be. However,
back in the '80s and early '90s,

37:48.314 --> 37:51.568
this was the unofficial symbol
of a Loyalist organisation

37:51.593 --> 37:54.169
that went by the name of The Guild.

37:54.194 --> 37:58.499
Hm, The Guild supposedly consisted
of a group of powerful politicians,

37:58.524 --> 38:01.009
police officers, members
of the business community

38:01.034 --> 38:04.219
who allegedly sanctioned
political assassinations.

38:04.244 --> 38:05.889
Its existence was never proven.

38:05.914 --> 38:07.889
Investigative reporter Orla Flanagan

38:07.914 --> 38:11.398
wrote several articles about
them, citing an inside source.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.249
No names were ever mentioned,

38:13.274 --> 38:17.139
and the group was reportedly
disbanded years ago. Bloody hell.

38:20.444 --> 38:22.009
I'll follow up on it.

38:28.274 --> 38:31.939
The wheels are turning in
Hodgson's head. That obvious?

38:31.964 --> 38:35.328
Can practically hear them
whirring. What's on your mind?

38:36.603 --> 38:39.249
I, er, just remembered, I've got
to meet up with an old friend.

38:39.274 --> 38:41.999
I know that look, you're up
to something, Jack Hodgson.

38:43.343 --> 38:46.159
And what might that be,
Clarissa Mullery? I don't know.

38:46.184 --> 38:49.849
But I'm sure I'll find out
over the nice cold G&T

38:49.874 --> 38:51.679
that you are buying me.

38:57.744 --> 39:01.239
Jack Hodgson! You haven't changed a bit.

39:01.264 --> 39:04.239
Orla Flanagan, you have! For the better!

39:04.264 --> 39:06.438
Still full of charm and flattery, I see!

39:06.463 --> 39:08.289
Not to mention rugged good looks.

39:10.024 --> 39:13.749
Tell me about it! The crush
I used to have on this fella!

39:13.774 --> 39:16.799
Never got anywhere with
Mr I-have-to-study. All right.

39:16.824 --> 39:19.388
Clarissa Mullery,
I'm a colleague of Jack's.

39:19.413 --> 39:20.749
Nice to meet you, Clarissa.

39:25.064 --> 39:26.749
Orla...

39:29.154 --> 39:31.489
Ah...Orla...

39:31.514 --> 39:35.209
...we need to pick your brain
about something.. Pick away.

39:35.234 --> 39:36.289
It's about The Guild.

39:37.954 --> 39:40.768
Can I assume this is
something to do with your work?

39:40.793 --> 39:42.999
And you're going to say
we can't talk about it...

39:44.954 --> 39:46.438
If it has a bearing on a case,

39:46.463 --> 39:49.719
why am I talking to two forensic
scientists and not the police?

39:49.744 --> 39:51.929
You may well get a visit from the police,

39:51.954 --> 39:54.849
but this here now is just two
old mates having a drink.

39:57.154 --> 39:58.489
What do you want to know?

39:58.514 --> 40:01.159
Do you think it's possible
it might be active again?

40:02.463 --> 40:05.039
I've not heard anything
that would suggest that, no.

40:06.593 --> 40:09.719
You had an inside source. Jack...

40:09.744 --> 40:12.359
...you know better than to ask
a reporter to reveal her source.

40:12.384 --> 40:15.079
I'm not asking you to reveal anything.

40:15.104 --> 40:18.599
All I'm asking is...might it
be possible to re-establish

40:18.624 --> 40:21.518
contact with that source, to find out?

40:21.543 --> 40:25.239
I know The Guild has
personal meaning for you...

40:25.264 --> 40:28.079
...but I was getting phone
calls threatening to put

40:28.104 --> 40:30.009
a bullet in the back of my head.
I know.

40:30.034 --> 40:33.079
You think it's too dangerous,
don't do it.

40:33.104 --> 40:34.289
I don't mind the danger...

40:35.984 --> 40:40.079
...but if I'm to go opening up doors
again that nobody wants opened,

40:40.104 --> 40:44.359
I need a better reason than
a favour to an old mate.

40:44.384 --> 40:47.129
I think what Jack's trying to say,

40:47.154 --> 40:50.209
in his graceful, understated way...

40:50.234 --> 40:53.599
...is that the information
that you provide

40:53.624 --> 40:57.398
might potentially save lives -
that is a good reason, isn't it?

41:02.624 --> 41:04.289
She's good.

41:25.704 --> 41:26.849
Hi, this is Les Walsh.

41:26.874 --> 41:29.879
"Please leave a message, I'll get
back to you as soon as I can."

41:33.874 --> 41:35.929
When you were growing up back in Belfast,

41:35.954 --> 41:37.879
did people ever talk about The Guild?

41:37.904 --> 41:41.599
Talk? It's Northern Ireland,
people never stop talking.

41:41.624 --> 41:45.119
And you believed that it
existed? I believed a lot of things,

41:45.144 --> 41:47.129
not all of them turned out to be true.

41:47.154 --> 41:49.849
What about your family? Your dad?

41:49.874 --> 41:52.239
Where exactly are you
going with this, Clarissa?

41:52.264 --> 41:55.398
I'm just wondering if there
are any personal insights

41:55.423 --> 41:57.568
into The Guild that you could offer.

41:58.984 --> 42:00.879
Mm...

42:00.904 --> 42:03.289
Well, my personal insight is this...

42:03.314 --> 42:05.799
Go to bed, I'll see you in the morning.

42:09.514 --> 42:12.209
"I'm really sorry, but I
need some time on my own,

42:12.234 --> 42:13.844
"don't worry, I'm fine."

42:15.525 --> 42:18.380
I will issue an alert for
your husband and the car.

42:18.405 --> 42:20.141
Try not to worry.

42:21.856 --> 42:25.500
There is also something
you need to know, Marie...

42:25.525 --> 42:28.661
...we think your
father-in-law might still be alive.

42:28.686 --> 42:30.111
All that blood - I thought...

42:30.136 --> 42:34.021
Pat may have been in
touch with your husband.

42:34.046 --> 42:36.071
I don't understand. Why?

42:36.096 --> 42:39.071
We don't know, but we
will monitor your phone,

42:39.096 --> 42:40.741
in case Les rings again.

42:50.882 --> 42:50.937
Mummy? Hello, you. Let's go
in. When's Daddy coming back?

42:50.962 --> 42:55.376
Mummy? Hello, you. Let's go
in. When's Daddy coming back?

43:23.602 --> 43:27.546
Orla Flanagan. I checked up on
those articles she wrote on The Guild.

43:27.571 --> 43:30.376
Interesting reading. Aye,
Orla knows her stuff.

43:30.401 --> 43:32.426
You know her?

43:32.451 --> 43:35.347
Um...we were college mates.

43:37.162 --> 43:39.577
Well, Flanagan refers to
a source in her article.

43:39.602 --> 43:42.296
If The Guild is active agin,
that source might know.

43:42.321 --> 43:45.097
You'll have to ask Orla.
Hell will freeze over

43:45.122 --> 43:48.657
before a reporter reveals
her source to a police officer.

43:48.682 --> 43:50.787
However, if an old friend were to ask...

43:51.882 --> 43:55.707
I had a drink with her last
night. What did you talk about?

43:55.732 --> 43:57.987
Just asked the same question you did.

43:58.012 --> 44:00.657
Whether Orla establishes
contact with her source or not

44:00.682 --> 44:02.217
is entirely up to her.

44:09.682 --> 44:14.577
So, the thing is, if China
is interested in financing...

44:14.602 --> 44:18.626
...in Belfast, that's the
sort of contact we need.

44:20.571 --> 44:22.707
We'll only be about an hour, Craig.

44:22.732 --> 44:24.626
Right, Ms Lawson.

44:24.651 --> 44:28.907
Because the level of finances
that they're talking about...

44:50.892 --> 44:52.546
Hello?

44:54.492 --> 44:58.067
Hello, who is this? Hello, Orla.

44:58.092 --> 45:00.457
What's so urgent that it can't wait?

45:03.842 --> 45:06.707
Were DSTL able to determine provenance?

45:06.732 --> 45:09.017
OK, hang on, let me talk you through this.

45:09.042 --> 45:11.376
So, the detonation trigger is
radio-controlled

45:11.401 --> 45:14.147
instead of the modern
preference of mobile phone.

45:14.172 --> 45:17.017
Also, I detected RDX,
a Semtex ingredient

45:17.042 --> 45:20.577
of a variety widely used by
bomb-makers in the 1980s.

45:20.602 --> 45:24.147
Enough detail to pinpoint an
individual bomb-maker's signature?

45:24.172 --> 45:27.296
Well, the way the wires are
tied and the red electrical tape,

45:27.321 --> 45:32.506
are both characteristic of IEDs
made in South Armagh in the '80s.

45:32.682 --> 45:37.227
Added to that...these tool
markings are like fingerprints.

45:37.252 --> 45:40.267
DSTL could match them up
to the individual tools used -

45:40.292 --> 45:42.147
however, without those tools,

45:42.172 --> 45:45.787
it's a like having a bullet but
no gun to match its ballistics.

45:45.812 --> 45:48.227
So, in answer to your question -

45:48.252 --> 45:50.577
the best they could do
was narrow it down

45:50.602 --> 45:53.147
to these seven possible candidates,

45:53.172 --> 45:55.067
known to have operated in South Armagh.

45:56.892 --> 46:00.657
Looks like Patrick Walsh.
Well, I'll be damned. Exactly.

46:22.212 --> 46:24.147
Taking care of yourself, I see.

46:24.172 --> 46:25.347
Somebody's got to do it!

46:28.892 --> 46:30.457
Still single?

46:31.812 --> 46:34.227
I don't know if you are
being creepy or endearing.

46:35.892 --> 46:37.347
Bit of both, I suppose.

46:41.252 --> 46:44.017
I heard a rumour... that they're back.

46:48.762 --> 46:50.197
I'm long out of the loop.

46:52.042 --> 46:54.227
You're Ken Lawson's chauffeur.

46:54.252 --> 46:56.147
He might pretend to be a businessman,

46:56.172 --> 46:58.267
but we both know he's a
political lobbyist.

46:59.842 --> 47:02.737
Even if I knew anything, I
have no reason to talk to you.

47:03.932 --> 47:05.306
You did, before.

47:05.331 --> 47:07.737
I did, before, because I
wanted our people to know

47:07.762 --> 47:09.867
that justice was being served.
- And now?

47:14.092 --> 47:16.347
Times are different.

47:16.372 --> 47:18.306
Maybe.

47:18.331 --> 47:19.907
For how much longer?

47:22.122 --> 47:26.017
People are scared, no
matter which side they're on.

47:26.042 --> 47:28.657
When people are scared, they
revert to what they know.

47:29.892 --> 47:31.227
Are they back?

47:33.012 --> 47:35.817
I've driven Mr Lawson to a
number of meetings recently.

47:37.292 --> 47:39.667
Some familiar old faces.

47:39.692 --> 47:40.707
Who, exactly?

47:42.331 --> 47:44.176
Doesn't matter.

47:44.201 --> 47:46.587
If the killings start, there's
nothing you can do about it,

47:46.612 --> 47:49.376
you can only stay out of the
way. That's not my style, Craig.

47:51.942 --> 47:53.817
I don't want you stirring
up shit again.

47:55.531 --> 47:56.867
Just leave it alone.

48:20.302 --> 48:22.347
Who are we waiting for?

48:22.372 --> 48:25.457
The less you know, the better.

48:25.482 --> 48:28.667
Dad, I want to help you, but I
am not going in to this blindly.

48:32.451 --> 48:35.556
He's an old friend from back home.

48:35.581 --> 48:37.227
What's his name?

48:39.581 --> 48:41.376
It's better you don't know.

48:42.892 --> 48:47.917
Well, why do you want to see him?
Does he know who did this to Mum?

48:47.942 --> 48:50.147
Maybe.

48:52.581 --> 48:56.386
Dad, this is all so crazy. Why would
anybody want to kill her - or you?

48:56.411 --> 48:58.227
I don't understand it.

48:58.252 --> 49:00.097
I don't know who did this.

49:01.302 --> 49:02.947
We'll find out.

49:06.812 --> 49:08.306
Won't be long.

49:09.892 --> 49:12.386
I don't want you involved
any more than need be.

49:12.411 --> 49:16.277
Oh, Dad... Whoever's behind
this, they are dangerous people.

49:16.302 --> 49:18.067
Yes, I need your help...

49:18.092 --> 49:20.917
...but I don't want to
draw you or your family in

49:20.942 --> 49:22.306
any more than need be.

49:22.331 --> 49:23.867
I want you safe.

49:36.892 --> 49:40.707
Niall Molloy - joined the IRA in '76...

49:42.052 --> 49:47.176
...first IED attributed to him
went off in County Antrim in '79.

49:47.372 --> 49:50.607
Since then, he was involved
in a total of 12 bombings,

49:50.632 --> 49:54.247
killing more than 60 people,
many of them civilians.

49:54.272 --> 49:57.196
Had a reputation as a
master of the art.

50:00.551 --> 50:02.406
Earned him his nickname:
Deathmaker.

50:16.912 --> 50:19.607
Do you think I could get
a shot of that inhaler?

50:19.632 --> 50:22.607
Yeah! Of course. You're a life-saver.

50:29.792 --> 50:32.297
Several Loyalist paramilitary groups

50:32.322 --> 50:34.737
had Molloy at the top of their hit list,

50:34.762 --> 50:37.247
including the group known as The Guild.

50:37.272 --> 50:42.326
June of 1991 - rumour has it
that Niall Molloy wants out.

50:42.351 --> 50:47.127
IRA hierarchy won't let him.
A few days later - he vanishes.

50:47.152 --> 50:51.737
Now, acting on an anonymous
tip, the RUC find traces of blood,

50:51.762 --> 50:55.807
along with a bloodstained
knife, in an old farmhouse.

50:55.832 --> 51:00.127
Oh, my God. It was established the
blood on the knife matched Molloy's.

51:00.152 --> 51:03.446
But no group claimed responsibility
for Molloy's disappearance,

51:03.471 --> 51:06.656
and that was the end of the
matter. Except, it wasn't.

51:08.402 --> 51:12.196
This is a photo of the real
Patrick Walsh.

51:12.221 --> 51:16.446
According to Irish records, a
Patrick Walsh died in 1989

51:16.471 --> 51:18.377
of natural causes...in County Kerry.

51:19.632 --> 51:23.446
So, hang on, a former IRA
bomber's wife is blown up

51:23.471 --> 51:26.656
with a device which
bears all the hallmarks of...

51:26.681 --> 51:30.206
...the bomber's own device,
right down to the detail.

51:30.231 --> 51:33.767
So, either Pat Walsh was
trying to kill his own wife...

51:34.962 --> 51:37.526
Or someone was trying to
make a very clear statement.

51:54.962 --> 51:57.377
What's his name? Rocky.

51:59.192 --> 52:02.576
Does he pack a punch? Aye, sure.

52:02.601 --> 52:04.127
He's a dote.

52:07.042 --> 52:09.526
Slainte. Slainte.

52:19.072 --> 52:20.526
Is this what we're reduced to?

52:23.592 --> 52:26.377
Drinking Irish whiskey
wrapped in a Union Jack?

52:28.402 --> 52:30.847
At least we're alive.

52:30.872 --> 52:32.047
True.

52:39.792 --> 52:42.326
Niall, it wasn't me.

52:43.431 --> 52:45.927
I didn't talk. Then who did?

52:48.072 --> 52:49.127
I don't know.

52:50.551 --> 52:52.607
You know...

52:53.952 --> 52:56.526
...there was a time when I
thought it might be our old mates

52:56.551 --> 52:59.206
come back for their pound of flesh...

52:59.231 --> 53:01.177
...but, no...

53:01.202 --> 53:03.017
...why would the IRA go
to all the trouble

53:03.042 --> 53:06.526
of making and planting a bomb...when
a bullet in the back of the head

53:06.551 --> 53:08.206
would do the trick just as well?

53:14.512 --> 53:16.567
Take your hand out of your pocket.

53:16.592 --> 53:17.817
What?

53:29.792 --> 53:32.937
Niall...the beatings I took
for you in the old days...

53:32.962 --> 53:35.887
I was tortured, I never gave you up!

53:35.912 --> 53:37.847
Yeah...

53:38.992 --> 53:40.567
...but this time?

53:46.231 --> 53:49.047
You caved in after three
broken fingers.

53:50.762 --> 53:52.247
Who was it?

53:52.272 --> 53:53.737
I didn't see his face.

53:55.512 --> 53:56.897
Accent?

53:56.922 --> 53:58.687
I don't know.

53:59.992 --> 54:03.127
It was a Brit. He was waiting for me.

54:03.152 --> 54:05.817
Wanted to know if Niall
Molloy was still alive.

54:05.842 --> 54:07.847
Where he lived.

54:07.872 --> 54:11.687
Was he acting on his own,
or did someone send him?

54:40.282 --> 54:41.567
You going somewhere, Mac?

54:43.872 --> 54:46.967
Please...Niall..

54:46.992 --> 54:48.687
Somewhere safe, maybe?

55:04.762 --> 55:06.487
I know you have a bolthole, we all do.

55:07.712 --> 55:09.127
Write it down.

55:19.512 --> 55:20.767
Look...

55:21.992 --> 55:23.257
...I won't say a word!

55:23.282 --> 55:24.406
You know that!

55:25.922 --> 55:27.257
I know.

55:45.681 --> 55:47.737
Please...

55:47.762 --> 55:49.536
...you don't have to do this!

55:57.792 --> 56:00.097
Niall...I'm begging you!

56:02.122 --> 56:03.897
Please...

56:04.305 --> 56:10.729
