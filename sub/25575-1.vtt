Do you think it's
gonna sell out?

00:26.209 --> 00:27.487
What?

00:27.489 --> 00:28.608
Fright Fest.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.687
Well, which movie
looked best to you?

00:34.689 --> 00:36.767
Uhm, I don't know.

00:36.769 --> 00:38.558
Well, there Kamarimanku.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.062
There's Camp Blood.

00:40.064 --> 00:42.206
Full Moon Silver Bullet.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.158
Or Bride of the Living Dead.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.697
The horror movie.

00:47.904 --> 00:49.024
Two, please.

00:51.905 --> 00:55.169
Fright Fest!

00:59.137 --> 01:01.215
Alright, so you have to
have an opinion on this.

01:01.217 --> 01:03.615
Fast zombies or slow zombies?

01:03.617 --> 01:05.281
I don't know, fast?

01:07.394 --> 01:09.983
No, fast zombies are
a total abomination.

01:09.985 --> 01:11.424
You lose all nuance.

01:11.426 --> 01:14.271
If you think about it, zombies
are the total metaphor for...

01:14.273 --> 01:16.032
So we're locked
in here all night?

01:16.034 --> 01:18.338
Yeah, if you can handle it.

01:19.363 --> 01:21.472
Greetings
my bloody talon.

01:21.474 --> 01:23.231
Welcome to Fright Fest.

01:31.330 --> 01:33.440
I have hand picked
four tremulous tales

01:33.442 --> 01:35.903
to invade your
cinemaplex tonight.

01:35.905 --> 01:37.631
These four distinct
tastes of terror

01:37.633 --> 01:40.703
will run throughout the night.

01:40.705 --> 01:42.623
If the first taste isn't enough,

01:42.625 --> 01:45.570
go back for seconds,
thirds, fourths.

01:46.626 --> 01:48.832
This is a buffet of blood.

01:48.834 --> 01:51.393
Gorge yourself on gore!

01:51.395 --> 01:54.338
But, it's not for
the faint of heart.

01:55.491 --> 01:57.857
At any point you find
the horrors too much,

01:57.859 --> 02:01.120
you'll find a chicken exit
located just left of the screen.

02:23.874 --> 02:24.644
Darach?

02:27.267 --> 02:28.801
Darach?

02:28.803 --> 02:30.977
Christ, Sarah, what?

02:30.979 --> 02:32.448
I heard something downstairs.

02:32.450 --> 02:34.817
Chicken exit, really?

02:34.819 --> 02:37.793
I have never taken
the chicken exit.

02:37.795 --> 02:40.035
Wow, you must be so proud.

02:42.275 --> 02:43.873
Go back to
sleep, it's the rock.

02:43.875 --> 02:45.537
No, Darach.

02:45.539 --> 02:46.627
Darach!

02:46.629 --> 02:48.803
Please, go back to sleep.

02:49.891 --> 02:51.971
I have a massive headache.

02:52.963 --> 02:55.012
Turn off the bloody light.

04:47.942 --> 04:48.709
Darach?

05:42.951 --> 05:44.484
Sarah?

05:44.486 --> 05:46.341
I'm inspector O'Connor.

05:46.343 --> 05:47.685
Yes?

05:47.687 --> 05:49.605
I was hoping to ask
Sarah some questions.

05:49.607 --> 05:51.269
She already
explained everything

05:51.271 --> 05:53.926
to the other police officers.

05:53.928 --> 05:54.728
Yes.

05:59.335 --> 06:03.077
Sarah, I was told that you
heard someone in the room

06:03.079 --> 06:06.022
with your husband
before you found him.

06:06.024 --> 06:06.822
A scream?

06:09.864 --> 06:11.944
It was a woman, wailing.

06:13.512 --> 06:17.512
Like a, something like nails
on a chalkboard or something.

06:20.392 --> 06:22.726
This noise,
it came from the bedroom?

06:22.728 --> 06:23.528
Yeah.

06:24.648 --> 06:27.046
Did you see this woman?

06:27.048 --> 06:29.413
She wasn't in there.

06:29.415 --> 06:34.118
Did you see anyone entering
or leaving the house?

06:34.120 --> 06:34.919
No.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.120
You think I'm crazy.

06:40.584 --> 06:42.534
I believe you heard something,

06:42.536 --> 06:45.736
but events like this
can cloud your mind.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.998
These bottles, they
from last night?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.263
Yeah, that's enough,
leave us, please.

06:52.265 --> 06:53.704
She needs to rest.

06:55.145 --> 06:58.278
Look, I'll call you if we
find out anything unusual

06:58.280 --> 07:00.071
about your husband's death,

07:00.073 --> 07:03.943
and we'll get that comb
you found analyzed.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.665
If you think of
anything, call me.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.432
Hey, I
made you some tea,

07:24.361 --> 07:26.026
and cleaned a little.

07:27.593 --> 07:30.342
Did you get rest last night?

07:30.344 --> 07:31.145
A bit.

07:32.424 --> 07:33.224
Good.

07:40.841 --> 07:44.039
Sarah, why don't you come
and stay with us for a while?

07:44.041 --> 07:48.041
I think being amongst people
in the city will do you good.

07:49.225 --> 07:53.480
Thanks, but I think
I need some time alone.

07:53.482 --> 07:54.666
Okay.

08:09.162 --> 08:10.823
You know, last
night I kept thinking

08:10.825 --> 08:14.442
about something that
happened a few days ago.

08:16.585 --> 08:21.320
Darach came back from the walking
the fields a few days ago,

08:21.322 --> 08:22.379
and he was...

08:24.651 --> 08:27.593
Drunk out of his
mind, but terrified.

08:29.291 --> 08:32.841
He said he saw a
woman there screaming,

08:32.842 --> 08:34.539
then she disappeared.

08:36.107 --> 08:39.945
And that it was some ghost
that haunts his family

08:39.947 --> 08:41.130
or something...

08:42.219 --> 08:43.018
Banshee.

08:43.913 --> 08:45.288
You know it?

08:45.290 --> 08:48.587
It's a story my mom
told me as a child.

08:49.482 --> 08:51.466
Well, what is it?

08:51.468 --> 08:53.705
It's a kid's story.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.049
Tell me.

08:55.051 --> 08:55.850
Well...

08:59.116 --> 09:02.954
There's this legend about
a woman called a banshee,

09:02.956 --> 09:06.312
who would haunt some
of the Irish families.

09:06.314 --> 09:09.065
And she would wait
forever in the field

09:09.067 --> 09:12.008
for her husband to
return from the sea.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.114
Well, according to the legend,

09:15.116 --> 09:17.450
people who would hear her wail,

09:17.452 --> 09:20.713
would have a family
member die that night.

09:20.715 --> 09:24.234
And people who saw her
would die themselves.

09:25.419 --> 09:28.040
Darach would have
seen this banshee.

09:28.042 --> 09:30.697
No, Sarah,
it's a ghost story.

09:30.699 --> 09:33.162
There's no such
thing as a banshee.

09:33.164 --> 09:35.274
Well, then what do
you think what I heard?

09:35.276 --> 09:36.713
You said you heard a rumble.

09:36.715 --> 09:37.611
And a scream!

09:37.613 --> 09:39.755
It could have been Darach.

09:40.651 --> 09:42.378
He had a heart attack.

09:42.380 --> 09:43.529
He was only 29.

09:43.531 --> 09:45.675
And an alcoholic.

09:49.324 --> 09:50.442
Out.

09:50.444 --> 09:51.242
Look, Sarah...

09:51.244 --> 09:52.460
Please leave.

11:56.430 --> 11:58.989
This is where you saw her?

11:58.991 --> 12:00.110
Right there.

12:01.230 --> 12:03.373
Did you get a
good look at her?

12:03.375 --> 12:05.197
She was quite far away,

12:05.199 --> 12:09.200
but she had a white dress
covered in blood and long hair.

12:11.823 --> 12:13.679
She just disappeared?

12:15.086 --> 12:18.861
I know how it sounds, but
you should know what I saw.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.743
Sarah, I wanna
believe you, but...

12:26.287 --> 12:28.558
You know about the banshee?

12:31.151 --> 12:31.951
Yes.

12:33.103 --> 12:36.015
When I got the call
about your husband,

12:36.847 --> 12:39.149
about the scream you heard,

12:39.151 --> 12:42.285
I've heard about that before.

12:42.287 --> 12:44.141
Long time ago.

12:44.143 --> 12:47.309
When I was a boy, my
father claimed our family

12:47.311 --> 12:50.061
was one of the Irish
families cursed

12:50.063 --> 12:52.464
by a pagan witch, the banshee.

12:54.703 --> 12:57.421
My father said he heard the wail

12:57.423 --> 13:00.237
the night before my
uncle passed away.

13:00.239 --> 13:01.936
I thought he was mad.

13:04.271 --> 13:05.167
And uh...

13:07.119 --> 13:08.560
Do you believe me?

13:09.744 --> 13:13.134
I don't
know what I believe.

13:13.136 --> 13:15.822
We'll do some research
into the banshee.

13:15.824 --> 13:18.126
It's all I can promise for now.

13:18.128 --> 13:18.928
Thanks.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.838
And did you find
anything on the comb?

13:25.840 --> 13:26.608
Nothing.

13:33.936 --> 13:35.918
Sarah,
are you alright?

13:35.920 --> 13:37.840
Yeah, just some sleep.

18:18.229 --> 18:19.283
Sarah?

18:19.285 --> 18:21.205
It's Inspector O'Connor.

18:22.358 --> 18:24.245
I think the
banshee's in the house.

18:24.247 --> 18:25.269
What?

18:25.271 --> 18:26.643
I'm on my way, listen.

18:26.645 --> 18:29.556
I did some research on the
banshee, you need to hear this.

18:29.558 --> 18:31.411
Apparently, the legend
is based on a woman

18:31.413 --> 18:34.740
who lived in the 1600s, who
was nicknamed the Banshee.

18:34.742 --> 18:37.268
She sacrificed her
husband in some ritual

18:37.270 --> 18:39.540
and claimed he went off to sea.

18:39.542 --> 18:41.366
What happened to her?

18:42.743 --> 18:44.822
The villagers
found her blood stained dress.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.316
She was burned at
the stake as a witch.

18:47.318 --> 18:49.462
The villagers believed
she imprinted her evil

18:49.464 --> 18:50.966
in her silver comb.

18:52.182 --> 18:53.782
Sarah, there's more.

18:55.128 --> 18:56.372
It's not what you think.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.406
Sarah?

19:01.752 --> 19:02.551
Sarah?

19:22.264 --> 19:24.119
Sarah, what's going on?

19:53.752 --> 19:54.553
Sarah?

20:03.416 --> 20:04.216
Sarah?

20:06.808 --> 20:07.832
She's gone.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.096
Sarah,
are you alright?

20:17.080 --> 20:18.358
She's gone.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.431
I defeated her, I
burned her comb.

20:21.433 --> 20:22.968
Sarah, what comb?

20:23.992 --> 20:24.792
Comb.

20:27.736 --> 20:30.486
I wanted to tell
you on the phone.

20:30.488 --> 20:33.366
The story about the
witch, the banshee...

20:33.368 --> 20:34.712
They're not real.

20:36.057 --> 20:38.839
I saw her in the house.

20:38.841 --> 20:40.184
- Sarah...
- She...

20:41.433 --> 20:43.833
It's a delusion.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.521
She's not real?

20:47.673 --> 20:50.614
These stories about
fairies and witches,

20:50.616 --> 20:53.879
they're just inspiration
for your mind.

20:53.881 --> 20:55.896
People have been telling stories

20:55.898 --> 20:58.617
about the banshee
since the 1600s.

20:59.609 --> 21:01.400
But it's all in your mind.

21:01.402 --> 21:03.705
I don't understand.

21:04.665 --> 21:06.585
Sarah, you're not well.

21:08.985 --> 21:12.185
The banshee is a
warning from your body.

21:18.170 --> 21:21.210
Come on, let me make
you a cup of tea.

21:24.762 --> 21:27.642
No, I think that
I need some rest.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.309
This sucks, I'm leaving!

24:03.550 --> 24:04.349
Really?

24:06.236 --> 24:08.477
Right at the good part, too.

24:17.501 --> 24:20.061
Shit!

24:22.398 --> 24:25.404
Come on, Frankie, get
it together, Jesus.

24:25.406 --> 24:27.132
Hey, you alright?

24:27.134 --> 24:28.414
Yup, I'm fine.

24:29.788 --> 24:33.275
What happened,
you get spooked?

24:33.277 --> 24:35.518
I mean, you could have left.

24:36.926 --> 24:39.516
Remember the whole chicken exit?

24:39.518 --> 24:40.862
You're my ride.

24:42.078 --> 24:43.837
I'm fine, what's next?

24:45.149 --> 24:48.604
Full Moon just
started in theater five?

24:48.606 --> 24:49.406
Perfect!

24:51.838 --> 24:53.118
Alright.

25:02.622 --> 25:04.284
You guys are
always at the same night.

25:04.286 --> 25:05.405
What, alright!

25:08.318 --> 25:12.319
Two for two,
okay, here you go, thank you.

25:13.502 --> 25:14.589
One, please.

25:14.591 --> 25:17.405
Hi Sir, one,
alright, there you go.

25:17.407 --> 25:20.444
Alright all the way to the left.

25:24.575 --> 25:25.853
Hey sir, how can I help you?

25:27.166 --> 25:27.965
There you go.

25:29.150 --> 25:31.551
Use the door right down there.

25:32.735 --> 25:34.108
- Hi, what can I do for you...
- One, please.

25:34.110 --> 25:37.438
One, gotcha,
there you go, enjoy your show.

25:38.271 --> 25:40.157
One, please.

25:40.159 --> 25:43.004
Sorry kid, it's a private
screening, invitation only.

25:43.006 --> 25:45.248
I have a note from my dad.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.957
Cute kid, but I
can't let you in.

25:48.959 --> 25:50.718
Come back tomorrow for
the screening of frozen.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.116
The horror movie
on the ski slope?

25:53.118 --> 25:53.888
No.

26:11.584 --> 26:12.959
Enjoy the show!

26:15.039 --> 26:16.542
For you, Sir?

26:16.544 --> 26:19.037
I'd like a rack of
ribs and some chicken.

26:19.039 --> 26:21.982
Okay, we just ran out of ribs,
but I can bring that chicken

26:21.984 --> 26:24.287
out to you in about a minute.

26:25.759 --> 26:27.198
And for you, Sir?

26:27.200 --> 26:28.096
Skittles.

26:29.216 --> 26:31.231
There's a
back door over here.

26:31.233 --> 26:33.885
Come on, Brandy, you really
wanna see a crappy movie?

26:33.887 --> 26:35.742
You're both chickenshits.

26:35.744 --> 26:37.886
I'm missing Vampire Diaries.

26:37.888 --> 26:38.944
Here it is!

26:52.671 --> 26:54.493
Shouldn't you be minding
the concession stand?

26:54.495 --> 26:56.030
We just ran out of meat!

26:56.032 --> 26:57.118
Did you check the freezer?

26:57.120 --> 26:58.271
Of course, I did!

26:58.273 --> 27:01.118
We're out, I'm telling
you, it's gone!

27:01.120 --> 27:02.270
10 minutes to sundown.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.383
I know, and I'm starving!

27:04.385 --> 27:06.430
I told you to eat
before you got here!

27:06.432 --> 27:09.312
I've got
a litter to feed!

27:18.209 --> 27:19.296
Ah!

27:19.298 --> 27:20.382
What?

27:20.384 --> 27:22.785
Ah, just that looks amazing!

27:29.089 --> 27:30.466
See ya, losers!

27:41.730 --> 27:43.263
And let's lock her up.

27:48.737 --> 27:50.049
Hey, let us in!

27:51.075 --> 27:52.736
Later losers!

27:52.738 --> 27:54.560
You suck and I
hope you get caught!

27:54.562 --> 27:58.783
Dad will get her out
of trouble, he always does.

28:07.713 --> 28:09.088
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!

28:09.986 --> 28:11.872
Welcome to oh, hey, hey, hey!

28:11.874 --> 28:13.375
We're thrilled to
have you with us!

28:13.377 --> 28:16.033
Before us the famous
cult classic film,

28:16.035 --> 28:18.432
Foaming at the Mouth Part Two.

28:18.434 --> 28:20.863
Also on behalf of
myself and my staff,

28:20.865 --> 28:23.617
I would like to apologize
for the shortage of food;

28:23.619 --> 28:25.344
however, we are
working diligently

28:25.346 --> 28:27.328
to get the problem resolved.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.184
In the meantime,

28:29.186 --> 28:32.160
the uncontrollable urge
to tear, claw or gnaw,

28:32.162 --> 28:34.017
please feel free to ask one

28:34.019 --> 28:36.672
of my lovely ushers
for a muzzle.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.106
We want meat!

28:40.194 --> 28:41.505
Okay, Sir, Sir,
we're doing everything

28:41.507 --> 28:42.944
we can to accommodate you.

28:42.946 --> 28:44.481
Bullshit!

28:44.483 --> 28:46.464
Yeah, let's get
those lights down.

28:46.466 --> 28:47.808
Enjoy your movie.

28:48.611 --> 28:50.467
Get outta here!

28:59.330 --> 29:01.921
Get away from me,
please get away from me!

29:01.923 --> 29:03.296
Please help me!

29:49.061 --> 29:51.524
Going somewhere, little girl?

29:56.099 --> 29:57.476
I remember you.

29:58.661 --> 30:00.004
Give her to me.

30:06.916 --> 30:10.562
Now to be fair we'll
have to raffle her off.

30:10.564 --> 30:12.163
Everyone check
their ticket stubs

30:12.165 --> 30:13.698
and let's get some numbers!

30:13.700 --> 30:15.490
Think she's got
enough meat on her

30:15.492 --> 30:16.931
for the four lucky winners!

30:20.452 --> 30:22.914
Don't worry, it won't hurt bad.

30:22.916 --> 30:23.906
What's your name?

30:23.908 --> 30:25.090
Brianne.

30:25.092 --> 30:27.586
Oh, Brianne, you
picked the wrong night

30:27.588 --> 30:29.315
to sneak into the
theater, Brianne.

30:29.317 --> 30:30.947
Hey Amanda, let's
get the numbers.

30:32.197 --> 30:34.053
Amanda, snap out of it.

30:43.044 --> 30:44.163
Winner!

30:46.885 --> 30:48.227
Winner!

30:48.229 --> 30:49.029
Two more!

30:54.629 --> 30:56.645
Oh, me, me, me, us, us!

30:57.477 --> 30:58.278
Winner!

31:02.277 --> 31:04.483
A little young there for a
tattoo, aren't you kiddo?

31:07.525 --> 31:09.061
Winner!

31:11.366 --> 31:12.995
What's the matter, little girl?

31:12.997 --> 31:14.851
It's not gonna be that bad?

31:14.853 --> 31:17.539
They'll kill you real
fast, we promise.

31:17.541 --> 31:19.587
Why didn't
you just let me in?

31:19.589 --> 31:21.732
I had a note from my dad.

31:21.734 --> 31:24.708
Oh, that's right,
a note from your dad.

31:24.710 --> 31:26.245
How could I forget?

31:29.318 --> 31:32.228
Please allow my
daughter, Brianne,

31:32.230 --> 31:35.523
to see the movie Foaming
at the Mouth Two.

31:35.525 --> 31:38.662
If you don't let her,
you'll regret it.

32:17.799 --> 32:19.173
Hey pal, what'd we miss?

32:19.175 --> 32:21.508
Just the standards,
full moons, owls

32:21.510 --> 32:24.709
and a guy with a monstrous
secret.

32:24.711 --> 32:25.511
Awesome.

33:35.079 --> 33:36.839
Hey buddy, you okay?

33:45.705 --> 33:47.368
I think we should go.

33:51.912 --> 33:53.543
Run!

34:17.898 --> 34:19.400
- Shit!
- Seriously?

34:20.489 --> 34:21.927
It's literally locked.

34:21.929 --> 34:23.208
Oh, my God!

34:23.210 --> 34:24.489
We gotta hide!

34:58.601 --> 35:00.137
Stop that!

35:00.139 --> 35:01.097
Stop what?

35:01.099 --> 35:02.216
What you're doing.

35:02.218 --> 35:05.319
Oh, you
mean, this?

35:05.321 --> 35:09.927
What time is it?

35:09.929 --> 35:11.592
4:30.

35:11.594 --> 35:13.863
I have to
leave pretty soon.

35:13.865 --> 35:16.105
Sun comes up at 6:30.

35:16.107 --> 35:18.152
My wife's plane doesn't
get here til 5:30.

35:18.154 --> 35:21.383
I'm not worried
about your wife.

35:21.385 --> 35:23.560
What does she do again?

35:23.562 --> 35:26.088
She works for the Ciph Room.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.304
Sounds boring.

35:27.306 --> 35:29.865
Yeah, it is, she's
always taking trips,

35:29.867 --> 35:32.809
leaving me here to
take care of the kids.

35:32.811 --> 35:34.536
You don't have kids.

35:34.538 --> 35:37.064
It's what I call the dogs.

35:37.066 --> 35:38.857
Divorce her.

35:38.859 --> 35:39.913
I can't.

35:39.915 --> 35:40.713
Can't?

35:40.715 --> 35:43.049
Not yet anyway.

35:43.051 --> 35:44.905
It's too much money involved.

35:44.907 --> 35:46.921
You don't need money
anymore, my dear.

35:50.571 --> 35:51.753
No fucking way!

35:51.755 --> 35:53.064
Quick, get in the closet!

35:53.066 --> 35:53.866
Oh, come on!

35:53.868 --> 35:54.668
Do it!

36:17.708 --> 36:20.105
Everything alright?

36:20.107 --> 36:22.154
Yeah, you're home early.

36:22.156 --> 36:25.834
Yeah, I took an earlier flight,
thought I'd surprise you.

36:25.836 --> 36:27.081
Well, you did.

36:27.083 --> 36:27.883
Good.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.385
What time did you go to bed?

36:33.387 --> 36:35.082
Oh, about 12:30.

36:35.084 --> 36:35.978
Really?

36:35.980 --> 36:37.420
It's pretty early.

36:51.020 --> 36:52.362
Who's in the closet?

36:52.364 --> 36:53.389
What?

36:54.349 --> 36:56.908
Do you think I'm stupid, Ronald?

36:59.276 --> 37:00.555
Calm down sweetie, okay?

37:00.557 --> 37:02.124
I will.

37:02.126 --> 37:04.234
Just let me check
one more thing first.

37:05.036 --> 37:06.252
Jesus Christ!

37:08.556 --> 37:10.317
Hah, how about that?

37:12.077 --> 37:13.260
You're crazy.

37:14.701 --> 37:17.579
Well, I have two bullets left.

37:17.581 --> 37:20.810
I can use one on you
and one on myself.

37:20.812 --> 37:23.213
No, I'll just use both on you.

37:24.301 --> 37:25.068
No wait!

37:34.605 --> 37:36.780
God, you're heavy.

37:41.998 --> 37:44.331
I gotta hand it to you, Ronald.

37:44.333 --> 37:47.723
You had me fooled
for at least a month.

37:47.725 --> 37:50.155
How long did you think
it would take me?

37:50.157 --> 37:53.516
Out every night, nowhere
to be seen during the day.

37:53.518 --> 37:55.595
I called your work last week.

37:55.597 --> 37:57.899
They said you just
stopped showing up.

37:57.901 --> 37:58.702
Schmuck.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.604
I guess this means you
won't have to divorce me.

38:02.606 --> 38:04.780
No pre-nup, either.

38:04.782 --> 38:09.004
Well, now that you're
dead, I can be honest.

38:09.006 --> 38:11.595
I never took that
trip to Atlanta.

38:11.597 --> 38:14.347
I just waited for you and
that whore in the back

38:14.349 --> 38:16.524
to make it to our bed.

38:16.526 --> 38:18.286
Well, my bed actually.

38:19.183 --> 38:21.548
I'm the one who paid for it.

38:21.550 --> 38:23.884
Where'd you find
the bimbo, anyway?

38:23.886 --> 38:27.886
I followed her around, but
couldn't find where she lived.

38:28.846 --> 38:30.286
Probably homeless.

38:31.150 --> 38:32.814
Way to aim high, Ron.

38:33.966 --> 38:37.644
I spent the last 10
years defending you.

38:37.646 --> 38:40.076
Do you even know
what I went through?

38:40.078 --> 38:42.861
My father kept telling
me, don't marry that man,

38:42.863 --> 38:44.397
he'll only hurt you.

38:44.399 --> 38:45.517
But did I listen?

38:45.519 --> 38:47.021
No.

38:47.023 --> 38:51.022
I just kept telling everyone,
you don't know the real Ron.

38:53.806 --> 38:56.047
Oh, it's just so disgusting.

38:59.566 --> 39:01.356
I hate you, Ronald.

39:01.358 --> 39:03.308
I hate everything about you.

39:03.310 --> 39:05.391
I'm glad that you're dead.

39:26.319 --> 39:28.303
Time to dump the garbage.

39:43.567 --> 39:45.998
Remember this spot, Ron?

39:46.000 --> 39:50.638
We used to stay up all night
and watch the sun come up.

39:50.640 --> 39:51.440
Hmm.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.904
Wow, S&M, charming.

40:09.936 --> 40:11.056
What the hell?

40:42.257 --> 40:44.783
Huh, that's what I thought.

40:56.528 --> 40:57.330
Oh, shit.

41:01.489 --> 41:02.288
Ronald!

41:06.961 --> 41:09.264
Ronald, where are you, honey?

41:25.937 --> 41:27.698
What the fuck is this?

41:29.394 --> 41:30.834
Elaine!

41:33.169 --> 41:35.600
I'm sorry about what I said.

41:36.562 --> 41:37.938
I don't hate you!

41:38.769 --> 41:40.849
I'm just uh, disappointed.

41:43.347 --> 41:45.776
Yeah, that's it, I'm just...

41:45.778 --> 41:48.176
Disappointed and hurt?

41:48.178 --> 41:49.552
Elaine.

41:49.554 --> 41:50.769
Sweety.

41:50.771 --> 41:53.104
Alright, alright,
you wanna divorce?

41:53.106 --> 41:55.312
I'll give you a divorce.

41:57.299 --> 41:58.098
Ron, dear?

42:01.938 --> 42:03.505
Shit.

42:32.755 --> 42:33.619
Hah, spare!

42:46.772 --> 42:49.234
I'll miss
watching the sun come up.

42:49.236 --> 42:51.794
You'll get used to it.

42:52.788 --> 42:55.025
Did you finish, Elaine?

42:55.027 --> 42:57.588
Actually, I had a better idea.

43:07.444 --> 43:09.939
She'll turn just before sunrise.

43:11.091 --> 43:13.394
Figured she'd like
to see it again.

43:13.396 --> 43:15.475
Just for old time's sake.

43:15.477 --> 43:19.157
Payback for putting
four bullet holes in me.

43:21.684 --> 43:22.964
Goodbye, dear.

43:24.275 --> 43:27.409
You know, it never really
was about the money.

43:27.411 --> 43:30.835
It was about spending
the rest of my life

43:30.837 --> 43:33.397
with someone as lifeless as you.

43:36.437 --> 43:40.373
Hurry up, we
have less than 30 minutes!

43:54.773 --> 43:56.947
You were great back there.

43:56.949 --> 43:58.194
Thanks, sweety.

43:58.196 --> 43:59.156
So were you.

44:26.198 --> 44:27.636
Ma'am, you okay?

44:34.646 --> 44:36.179
Cutting it pretty close.

44:36.181 --> 44:37.620
Drive faster.

44:37.622 --> 44:41.526
This is as fast as this
piece of shit goes, sweety.

44:45.589 --> 44:46.773
What the hell are you doing?

44:46.775 --> 44:47.988
I don't know.

44:47.990 --> 44:49.620
It must have got a
flat or something.

44:49.622 --> 44:51.477
Shit, keep driving.

44:51.479 --> 44:55.443
If I keep driving, it's
gonna make things worse.

45:04.503 --> 45:06.710
There's a spare in the back.

45:26.870 --> 45:29.269
What's taking so long?

45:29.271 --> 45:31.510
I thought I saw something.

45:38.264 --> 45:39.543
Open the door!

45:43.542 --> 45:45.013
- Shit!
- What?

45:45.015 --> 45:46.965
It's in Elaine's purse
at the bottom of the river!

45:46.967 --> 45:47.893
What about the house keys?

45:47.895 --> 45:49.591
Well, she had them.

45:55.351 --> 45:56.152
Shit!

46:03.351 --> 46:04.501
Don't you know
the combination?

46:04.503 --> 46:05.653
It's not working!

46:05.655 --> 46:07.095
It's been changed!

46:16.375 --> 46:18.678
Elaine,
open the door!

46:30.679 --> 46:33.080
Who's lifeless now, schmuck?

46:51.384 --> 46:54.455
So we just
stay in here all night?

46:54.457 --> 46:56.983
I don't know, I just,
I need some time to think.

46:56.985 --> 46:58.202
Okay.

47:15.608 --> 47:17.271
So do you do this for
all of your first dates,

47:17.273 --> 47:18.552
or am I special?

47:20.793 --> 47:22.486
What take them
to horror movies?

47:22.488 --> 47:26.489
No, save them from werewolves
and J-horror cliches.

47:31.865 --> 47:32.665
What?

47:34.585 --> 47:35.705
You like me.

47:37.369 --> 47:38.423
Do not.

47:49.785 --> 47:52.121
It's okay, I'm pretty cool.

47:53.722 --> 47:57.722
Yeah, you're okay, when
you're not being a diva.

47:58.554 --> 47:59.514
Excuse me?

48:02.234 --> 48:05.849
You know what, all my
attention's on you now.

48:07.226 --> 48:10.778
So don't screw this up,
lover boy, pressure's on.

48:16.538 --> 48:18.552
Did you hear that?

48:18.554 --> 48:19.834
Yeah, hang on.

48:43.450 --> 48:46.200
Jesus Christ, it's
Michael Martin.

48:46.202 --> 48:48.217
Michael Martin was in
Slumber Party Slaying.

48:48.219 --> 48:51.672
The killer in Camp
Blood is Norman Ferris.

48:51.674 --> 48:53.560
I think I love you.

48:53.562 --> 48:54.363
I know.

49:01.019 --> 49:02.043
Finch, Finch!

49:14.107 --> 49:16.346
Norman Ferris, no defense.

49:19.420 --> 49:20.699
Finch!

49:31.612 --> 49:32.921
Is that
supposed to work?

49:32.923 --> 49:34.714
Man, I don't know, he
drowned in the movie!

49:34.716 --> 49:35.833
God,
you're such a geek!

49:35.835 --> 49:37.498
No, I'm not!

50:08.348 --> 50:09.148
So Jack,

50:12.125 --> 50:16.377
you said your parents left
just before I got here?

50:16.379 --> 50:17.786
They do that a lot, huh?

50:17.788 --> 50:21.977
Just leave you here alone in
this big old house by yourself?

50:21.979 --> 50:23.261
I'm not alone.

50:26.621 --> 50:29.339
You're just like all
the other sitters.

50:29.341 --> 50:31.481
No one ever believes me.

50:31.483 --> 50:33.401
Hey, hey, take it easy.

50:33.403 --> 50:37.405
I believe you, it's just
a little unusual, is all.

50:38.365 --> 50:39.866
It's cool.

50:39.868 --> 50:42.940
It's just I don't normally
take jobs by text message.

50:42.942 --> 50:45.178
I like to talk to
the parents first.

50:45.180 --> 50:48.060
That way I know
what rules to break.

50:56.444 --> 50:58.331
I don't know about you,

50:58.333 --> 51:00.251
but I like to eat and
watch TV at the same time.

51:00.253 --> 51:02.076
But, but we're
not supposed to.

51:02.078 --> 51:03.418
Mom always says that when...

51:03.420 --> 51:04.764
Well, she isn't here, is she?

51:04.766 --> 51:06.780
So it'll be our little secret.

51:06.782 --> 51:08.891
Plus there's a pirates
versus ninjas movie on.

51:08.893 --> 51:09.693
Yay!

51:15.709 --> 51:18.012
You see this,
you pirate bitches?

51:18.014 --> 51:20.220
Uh, somebody save me!

51:20.222 --> 51:22.107
Don't you
see it will never end?

51:22.109 --> 51:24.635
Pirate killing ninja,
ninja killing pirate.

51:24.637 --> 51:26.492
It'll never stop.

51:26.494 --> 51:27.933
No, no it won't.

51:29.566 --> 51:33.116
Not unless I kill
every last one of them.

51:33.118 --> 51:34.587
He's just a peasant.

51:34.589 --> 51:35.932
The poor sheath
can hide this steel.

51:37.342 --> 51:38.204
I've got your back, pirate.

51:38.206 --> 51:39.421
What was that?

51:39.423 --> 51:40.317
There's
too many of them!

51:40.319 --> 51:41.052
You and Julia get out of here!

51:41.054 --> 51:42.556
Jack!

51:42.558 --> 51:43.359
Hey, Jack!

51:44.541 --> 51:45.755
You guys have a cat
or dog or something,

51:45.757 --> 51:47.132
you forgot to tell me about?

51:47.134 --> 51:50.972
Ninjas and pirates,
it's a new generation.

51:52.350 --> 51:54.014
Then what was that?

51:54.910 --> 51:56.125
I don't know.

51:57.085 --> 51:59.452
Probably the monsters.

51:59.454 --> 52:00.670
The monsters?

52:01.599 --> 52:03.678
The monsters in my room.

52:04.799 --> 52:07.423
You have monsters
in your room?

52:09.214 --> 52:11.998
Yeah, I'm sure
that's it, monsters.

52:37.279 --> 52:40.222
Just one
more story, please?

52:41.342 --> 52:43.517
Jack, you've had
just one more story

52:43.519 --> 52:45.597
about seven or
eight times already.

52:45.599 --> 52:47.134
It's time for bed, little buddy.

52:47.136 --> 52:51.422
Aw, my other sitters
always read me more stories.

52:51.424 --> 52:52.798
Hey speaking of,

52:52.800 --> 52:55.006
how many other
sitters have you had?

52:55.008 --> 52:57.534
You make it sound like no
one sticks around very long.

53:01.728 --> 53:05.085
Come on, Sarah,
just one more story.

53:05.087 --> 53:06.912
This one's my favorite.

53:09.503 --> 53:12.030
Look, you don't want
to go to bed, I get that.

53:12.032 --> 53:13.598
Is it the dark you're scared of?

53:13.600 --> 53:15.037
I can leave the light on.

53:15.039 --> 53:17.917
No, no, don't let
the light in, okay, promise?

53:17.919 --> 53:20.096
Okay, okay, take it easy.

53:21.056 --> 53:22.461
But think of it this way,

53:22.463 --> 53:24.158
if the light's on, the monsters

53:24.160 --> 53:27.038
are too scared to
come out, alright?

53:28.960 --> 53:31.457
They always come out, always.

53:39.904 --> 53:41.118
Oh.

53:57.088 --> 53:58.751
That little monkey.

53:58.753 --> 53:59.553
Jack!

54:06.752 --> 54:07.838
Jack!

54:07.840 --> 54:09.760
Don't make me come up...

54:10.914 --> 54:12.350
There.

54:14.529 --> 54:15.554
That's weird.

54:40.418 --> 54:42.527
Jack, I thought I told you to...

54:42.529 --> 54:45.600
It wasn't me, it
was the monsters.

54:45.602 --> 54:47.745
And what monsters
would that be?

54:47.747 --> 54:50.560
But they, they were...

54:50.562 --> 54:52.703
Jack, there are so
such thing as monsters,

54:52.705 --> 54:55.968
and there will be no
more playing, got it?

54:55.970 --> 54:57.696
It's bed time, buddy.

54:57.698 --> 54:59.042
Now sweet dreams.

55:01.730 --> 55:04.512
No one ever believes me.

55:31.234 --> 55:34.048
That is it, mister!

55:34.050 --> 55:36.612
You are going to be in so much...

55:46.370 --> 55:47.649
They're real!

55:47.651 --> 55:48.673
The monsters!

55:48.675 --> 55:50.017
I told you.

55:50.019 --> 55:51.649
Jack, I gotta get
you out of here!

55:51.651 --> 55:53.665
Oh, they're not
going to get me.

55:53.667 --> 55:56.481
They're trying to
get away from me.

55:56.483 --> 55:58.593
I like them, they're mine.

55:58.595 --> 56:01.057
I won't ever let them leave.

56:01.059 --> 56:01.859
Jack!

56:03.140 --> 56:05.123
It's not them, it's me.

56:06.499 --> 56:08.417
I'm the monster.

56:08.419 --> 56:10.979
The monster you're so scared of.

56:13.124 --> 56:13.924
No!

56:15.299 --> 56:16.259
It can't be!

57:09.316 --> 57:10.818
It's like Dawn
of the Dead here.

57:10.820 --> 57:13.826
Kinda yeah, with like
tweaking out zombies.

57:13.828 --> 57:17.509
No, like real 1978
lumbering Romero zombies.

57:24.069 --> 57:27.011
Well, I guess it's time
for the chicken exit.

57:27.013 --> 57:29.829
Do you think we
could push through?

57:31.173 --> 57:35.299
We're gonna have to
before they come fully to.

57:35.301 --> 57:36.195
You're kidding.

57:39.973 --> 57:41.283
That's our only way out.

57:41.285 --> 57:42.085
Okay.

59:37.639 --> 59:39.270
Well, I'm
not really sure

59:39.272 --> 59:41.286
how I'm gonna top this
for a second date.

59:41.288 --> 59:43.078
Second date?

59:43.080 --> 59:45.157
Well yeah, I mean,

59:45.159 --> 59:48.870
I kinda wanna take you
out again, if you want to.

59:48.872 --> 59:49.672
I had fun!

59:51.464 --> 59:54.278
And I guess you could say
I saved your ass in there,

59:54.280 --> 59:55.717
so I feel like you owe me.

59:55.719 --> 59:58.118
I owe you?

59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.584
Okay, one condition, no movies.

01:00:03.751 --> 01:00:05.925
Do you hear something?
