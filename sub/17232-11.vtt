Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.425 --> 00:04.953
This is gonna be huge.

00:04.954 --> 00:07.538
I don't think I can do this.
You can. You know you can.

00:07.539 --> 00:09.860
I need to be lettin' you go.

00:09.861 --> 00:11.747
So you came to me to find your voice again?

00:11.748 --> 00:13.742
Sometimes you gotta blow up the box.

00:13.849 --> 00:14.985
What the hell are you doing here?

00:14.986 --> 00:16.473
I came to pick up my big brother.

00:16.474 --> 00:17.110
Where's my guitar?

00:17.111 --> 00:19.582
I'm gonna get it back for
you real soon, I promise.

00:19.583 --> 00:22.522
Hey! Congratulations, Mr. mayor.

We love you, Rayna!

02:15.064 --> 02:17.306
That is the third night that
this has happened, okay?

02:17.307 --> 02:18.847
They're acting like I'm not even there.

02:18.848 --> 02:20.767
I mean, look, he's her guitar player.
What are you gonna do?

02:20.768 --> 02:22.803
So what? Is that some sort of excuse?

02:22.804 --> 02:23.925
Okay, I'll say something.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.266
But we gotta go. Your plane's waiting.

02:25.267 --> 02:26.456
Just do me a favor. Please tell me that

02:26.457 --> 02:28.598
I don't have to deal with
her until the party.

02:28.599 --> 02:29.602
Actually...

02:30.950 --> 02:32.778
We're giving her a ride to Nashville.

02:32.779 --> 02:35.124
You've got to be kiddin' me.

02:36.362 --> 02:38.272
Rayna. Fantastic!

02:38.273 --> 02:40.257
You killed it out there! I
don't even know what that was.

02:40.258 --> 02:43.272
Wow! Just the best concert
I've seen in years.

02:43.273 --> 02:45.892
Actually, since my last
Rayna James concert.

02:45.893 --> 02:47.609
Madison square garden, '09. Oh!

02:47.610 --> 02:48.892
And this is Calista Reeves.

02:48.893 --> 02:50.585
She's the president of
countless records. Oh.

02:50.586 --> 02:52.494
Oh, nice to meet you. Uh, she
flew in from L.A. to see you.

02:52.495 --> 02:56.121
Came to see her or me, love? 
Ah. Her, Liam.

02:57.631 --> 02:59.708
I would love to talk with you, Rayna,

02:59.709 --> 03:00.937
about what's next.

03:00.938 --> 03:03.650
Oh. Well, I'd love to talk to
you, but what's next for us

03:03.651 --> 03:05.661
is we're about to hop on Juliette's plane

03:05.662 --> 03:06.756
and fly back to Nashville

03:06.757 --> 03:09.234
'cause Edgehill's throwing
us a party for "wrong song."

03:09.235 --> 03:11.364
It hit number one. Congrats. 
Thank you.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.695
Well, you have a safe flight,
and I'll be in touch.

03:14.309 --> 03:15.495
Great to meet you.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.142
Liam. See you.

03:16.143 --> 03:17.448
Walk with me? Yep.

03:18.302 --> 03:19.865
Oh, my gosh.

03:21.038 --> 03:21.849
That felt good.

03:21.850 --> 03:22.915
Oh, yeah.

03:24.202 --> 03:25.444
She wants you.

03:26.970 --> 03:28.387
Can't say I blame her.

03:29.449 --> 03:30.484

The damn thing keeps
going out of tune. I...

03:59.911 --> 04:01.570
I think the bridge is shot.

04:02.487 --> 04:04.065
Where is your Gibson at?

04:05.496 --> 04:09.401
I sort of, uh... loaned
it to somebody who...

04:09.926 --> 04:11.363
Loaned it to somebody.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.309
That's because you're one
of the good ones, Gunnar.

04:15.310 --> 04:17.202
Well, you know what they
say about the nice guys.

04:17.202 --> 04:18.923
They finish last and...

04:18.978 --> 04:20.365
Down a Gibson.

04:20.387 --> 04:22.614
Not if we keep writin' songs
like that, you don't.

04:22.615 --> 04:24.290
Yeah, well, I just hope somebody...

04:24.876 --> 04:26.301
Will do more than just put a hold on it

04:26.302 --> 04:27.816
and cut the damn thing.

04:28.078 --> 04:30.071
Or we could perform it ourselves.

04:31.421 --> 04:32.872
Winter fest is coming up.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.877
Yeah, you... you don't want
to be going to that.

04:36.878 --> 04:38.777
It's not your thing.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.545
Why is it not my scene?

04:42.368 --> 04:43.785
Avery's playing it.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.065
Seriously?

04:47.237 --> 04:48.271
Awesome.

04:52.816 --> 04:54.101
I got you a $1,000 guarantee

04:54.102 --> 04:55.631
for the belmont show tomorrow.

04:55.927 --> 04:56.918
Hell, yeah.

04:56.919 --> 04:59.055
It's a grand more than the last gig paid.

04:59.093 --> 05:01.344
What's the, uh, party tomorrow night?

05:01.557 --> 05:02.770
The number one party for the song

05:02.771 --> 05:05.283
Rayna James and Juliette
Barnes sang at the Ryman.

05:05.284 --> 05:06.364
For you, it's a chance to meet

05:06.365 --> 05:08.423
everyone you need to know in music city.

05:09.341 --> 05:11.255
You giving Dominic a run for his money?

05:12.077 --> 05:13.615
He may give you a car.

05:13.616 --> 05:14.952
I'm giving you a career.

05:16.319 --> 05:17.672
What do you think of the backdrop?

05:19.339 --> 05:20.756
Want your picture in front of it?

05:21.682 --> 05:22.191
You know what?

05:22.192 --> 05:25.257
Lose the "the" and "band."

05:26.573 --> 05:28.599
From now on, it's just Avery Barkley.

05:30.423 --> 05:31.505
All right, guys.

05:32.696 --> 05:33.841
Let's do this.

05:38.552 --> 05:40.114
Has anyone seen my bean dip?

05:40.208 --> 05:41.236
What's it look like?

05:41.482 --> 05:43.891
Like a can that has "bean dip" on the side.

05:43.892 --> 05:45.470
Calista Reeves.

05:45.906 --> 05:47.019
Pretty big deal.

05:47.020 --> 05:50.311
Yeah. She's one of the most powerful
label heads in the industry.

05:50.690 --> 05:52.501
Maybe the most powerful.

05:52.502 --> 05:54.896
Well, I have to do my next
record with Edgehill.

05:55.046 --> 05:56.864
Well, she wants your next five records.

05:57.414 --> 05:59.132
"Wrong song" got you back on her radar.

05:59.133 --> 06:01.064
She loves what you did with it.

06:01.934 --> 06:03.069
We co-wrote it.

06:03.070 --> 06:04.392
"Co-" means "two."

06:04.494 --> 06:06.632
"Co-" actually means "with."

06:07.597 --> 06:08.872
Why's she on my plane?

06:09.342 --> 06:11.432
Oh, right. 'Cause she can't afford her own.

06:12.383 --> 06:14.871
I'm 3 feet away from you. I can hear you.

06:15.678 --> 06:16.637
Can you?

06:16.638 --> 06:18.229
That's interesting, 'cause
when we're onstage,

06:18.230 --> 06:19.917
y'all act like I don't even exist.

06:19.918 --> 06:21.225
Oh, believe me.

06:21.226 --> 06:24.119
We're both painfully
aware of your existence.

06:25.673 --> 06:27.512
That is my bean dip!

06:27.513 --> 06:29.007
Guys, we are going back for a party.

06:29.008 --> 06:32.209
Can we... look, just have some
fun, for crying out loud.

06:33.287 --> 06:36.050
I thought we were going back for
Juliette's mom's court hearing.

06:36.092 --> 06:37.891
Stop talking.

06:40.186 --> 06:42.434
Hey. Have you seen this?

06:42.809 --> 06:45.748
"The axe falls hard on
guitarman Deacon Claybourne."

06:50.289 --> 06:51.785
No. No, no, no, no. I know
what I think about it.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.299
I just wanna know what you think about it.

06:53.522 --> 06:55.345
No... yeah! The article!

06:55.346 --> 06:57.137
You think so? You think
it's true when Cy says,

06:57.138 --> 06:59.475
"we tried to give him a chance.
It just didn't pan out"?

06:59.476 --> 07:02.410
No! No, Carmen, that's what I'm saying.
It didn't not pan out.

07:02.411 --> 07:04.387
I caught the guy mauling my niece.

07:04.388 --> 07:04.988
I said "no comment"

07:04.989 --> 07:06.329
because I want her to have her own privacy.

07:06.330 --> 07:07.421
She deserves some privacy.

07:07.422 --> 07:08.516
I don't want to drag her into it.

07:08.517 --> 07:10.128
Hold on. Listen to me.

07:10.214 --> 07:11.978
"Letting someone go is always hard,

07:11.979 --> 07:14.031
but watching him fall off the
wagon, that's even harder."

07:14.032 --> 07:16.833
You believe that? You
think that's true? No!

07:16.834 --> 07:19.498
I haven't had a drink in 12 damn years!

07:19.499 --> 07:23.508
4,420 days, to be specific,
if you gotta know.

07:24.827 --> 07:25.845

07:44.862 --> 07:47.546
How do I have three shin guards
and only one cleat? Oh, no.

07:47.547 --> 07:49.057
I lost a tooth while you were gone.

07:49.058 --> 07:50.547
Lost a tooth and a cleat?

07:50.548 --> 07:52.724
What is the world coming
to when I leave town?

07:52.725 --> 07:54.274
Good morning. Hey.

07:54.275 --> 07:56.348
This came for you. Hey, kiddo.

07:56.739 --> 07:58.668
Hey, go get dressed for school. Hustle up.

07:58.915 --> 08:02.509
All right, breakfast in five. I
have slaved over this stove.

08:02.804 --> 08:04.765
Oh, my lord. What is this?

08:04.914 --> 08:07.338
You know, you didn't have to sleep
in the guest room last night.

08:07.339 --> 08:09.813
It was so late. I didn't wanna wake you up.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.650
Right. "Hope we get some time to talk."

08:11.651 --> 08:13.741
For starters, you need your own plane."

08:14.193 --> 08:15.728
Yes, I do need my own plane.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.951
Should I be jealous?

08:16.952 --> 08:18.930
I don't think so.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.675
Oh, my gosh.

08:21.032 --> 08:23.482
Calista Reeves. Countless records.

08:23.483 --> 08:24.749
Oh, my gosh.

08:24.750 --> 08:25.881
What's going on?

08:27.038 --> 08:28.264
Well, clearly, she means business.

08:28.265 --> 08:29.794
No, I'm talking about us.

08:30.455 --> 08:31.427
I mean...

08:31.432 --> 08:33.474
We're putting on a good face for the girls.

08:34.568 --> 08:36.547
We're sleeping in separate bedrooms.

08:37.448 --> 08:39.633
You and I haven't made love in months.

08:41.017 --> 08:44.306
I mean, are... are we trying to
fix things between us or not?

08:44.848 --> 08:48.106
You know, I think we took this
time apart to get some clarity.

08:51.088 --> 08:52.217
And...

08:53.294 --> 08:54.935
I don't have the answers yet.

09:07.595 --> 09:10.580
Would you stop pacing, please?
You're making me dizzy.

09:11.099 --> 09:14.104
Can you just explain this plea
deal to me one more time?

09:14.105 --> 09:15.492
It's simple, jolene.

09:15.897 --> 09:16.560
You plead guilty today,

09:16.561 --> 09:18.082
and as long as you complete rehab,

09:18.083 --> 09:19.146
the charges will be dropped...

09:19.147 --> 09:21.525
And you won't have to set
foot in this courtroom again.

09:21.577 --> 09:22.947
That'd be a relief.

09:23.524 --> 09:24.573
Deacon.

09:25.556 --> 09:26.867
Hey, you good?

09:28.237 --> 09:30.501
Hey. Thank you so much.

09:30.502 --> 09:32.946
This is Deacon. He's gonna be
speaking on my behalf. Deacon.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.127
Listen, about that. I just had
this article written about me.

09:35.128 --> 09:36.592
I... I'm just not sure

09:36.593 --> 09:38.305
how good it's gonna be, me talking for you.

09:38.306 --> 09:40.747
Are you talking about that
"tremolo" thing? Yeah.

09:40.961 --> 09:42.500
What was that? That's crap.

09:42.501 --> 09:44.577
I know what "not sober" looks like, okay?

09:44.578 --> 09:46.764
I grew up with it. That's not you.

09:47.393 --> 09:49.227
Well, I appreciate that. I just...

09:50.073 --> 09:52.364
I still think it might be
better if you talk today.

09:53.082 --> 09:54.725
No. No.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.517
I got her a great lawyer.
You're practically her sponsor.

09:57.518 --> 09:58.759
Why would I do the talkin'?

09:58.760 --> 09:59.845
Well, you're the person most affected

09:59.846 --> 10:01.376
by your mother's addiction.

10:01.453 --> 10:03.815
It would mean a lot more coming from you.

10:09.070 --> 10:10.407
That sucked.

10:10.478 --> 10:12.047
Hey. Or maybe you just did.

10:12.048 --> 10:14.169
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You...

10:14.608 --> 10:16.073
Need to stop being so hard on yourself.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.860
And you need to go do your homework.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.524
All right?

10:20.953 --> 10:22.215
You have a beautiful home.

10:22.216 --> 10:23.136
Thank you.

10:23.137 --> 10:25.093
Rayna, thank you so much for seeing me.

10:25.094 --> 10:27.009
Oh, yeah. My pleasure.

10:27.274 --> 10:28.484
You just can't be afraid of the ball.

10:28.485 --> 10:30.913
Such a sweet family. Aw, thanks.

10:31.302 --> 10:33.864
Poor Maddie does get her
athletic ability from me.

10:33.865 --> 10:35.404
Ohh, so sad.

10:35.405 --> 10:37.485
Oh, well, you have other talents.

10:37.486 --> 10:38.584
Thank you.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.424
And I appreciate you coming
over to the house today

10:40.425 --> 10:42.402
so I could have a little
more time with my girls.

10:42.403 --> 10:45.248
You only have 24 hours at home.
I mean, I do the same thing.

10:45.249 --> 10:46.428
I'm a mom, too.

10:48.625 --> 10:51.112
And the breadwinner. I get it.

10:51.113 --> 10:52.564
I appreciate that.

10:52.719 --> 10:55.193
I can't tell you how many
years I felt like I was

10:55.194 --> 10:57.170
hittin' my head against
a wall with Edgehill,

10:57.171 --> 10:58.849
trying to get 'em to understand that.

10:58.850 --> 10:59.810
Yeah, that's what Liam said

10:59.811 --> 11:01.960
when he sent me the last
roughs of what you guys cut.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.901
He... he sent you those tracks?

11:03.902 --> 11:05.288
Those tracks weren't ready to go out.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.534
Ready enough. No.

11:06.535 --> 11:09.605
Uh, yeah, he thinks it's time for a change,

11:09.606 --> 11:10.888
and I do, too.

11:11.133 --> 11:13.118
You're reinventing yourself.

11:13.119 --> 11:16.209
"Wrong song" is great to get you
to the top of the charts again,

11:16.210 --> 11:18.891
but the last thing you
need is to be pressured

11:18.892 --> 11:22.681
into doing duets with
some prefab prima Donna

11:22.682 --> 11:24.612
who came up overnight and...

11:24.690 --> 11:25.949
Can be gone just as fast.

11:25.950 --> 11:27.176
No offense.

11:28.846 --> 11:30.663
I know how hard leaving is.

11:30.702 --> 11:34.568
Believe me, it was hard when
I broke off from capitol.

11:34.878 --> 11:36.818
But it doesn't make staying right.

11:36.819 --> 11:37.851
Chicken.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.491
I'm not your chicken.

11:40.994 --> 11:42.382
Well, you know...

11:43.201 --> 11:46.260
It does feel like I sort of
have a lifetime investment.

11:46.261 --> 11:48.640
What you wanna do creatively,

11:48.927 --> 11:51.359
it's not in Marshall's wheelhouse.

11:52.030 --> 11:54.925
He's a bean counter and
he's never gonna get it.

11:54.926 --> 11:57.473
He came up in this business
with his head in the books,

11:57.474 --> 11:59.105
not in the headphones.

11:59.106 --> 12:01.963
Look, Rayna, I don't want to "sell" you.

12:02.385 --> 12:04.835
Ask Liam. He can vouch for me.

12:05.585 --> 12:08.667
I want to be your partner.

Busted!

13:14.563 --> 13:16.061
Let's get out of here.

13:18.145 --> 13:21.004
Jolene Barnes has learned from
her mistakes, your honor.

13:21.058 --> 13:22.379
She's not a criminal.

13:22.770 --> 13:26.957
She's a-a person with a disease.
She sought out treatment.

13:27.087 --> 13:31.131
And she only has 21 more days
left on a 60-day program.

13:31.218 --> 13:33.532
Her daughter Juliette is here

13:33.602 --> 13:35.564
to speak on her mother's behalf.

13:39.325 --> 13:40.604
Speak from your heart.

13:44.481 --> 13:47.131
Um, my mother has been an addict for...

13:47.378 --> 13:49.175
As long as I can remember,

13:50.034 --> 13:51.821
and I'm...

13:52.211 --> 13:55.442
Very glad that she is gettin'
the help that she needs.

13:56.370 --> 14:00.959
There's nobody who hopes
this sticks more than I do.

14:02.469 --> 14:04.079
That's all I have to say.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.277
Thank you for your testimonial, Ms. Barnes.

14:12.278 --> 14:15.200
I'll take this under advisement
and render a decision.

14:16.567 --> 14:17.856
It shouldn't be long.

14:29.511 --> 14:31.330
That was a hell of a speech in there.

14:31.623 --> 14:33.378
I mean, really emotional.

14:33.624 --> 14:34.776
You know, really moving.

14:34.777 --> 14:37.844
You told me to speak from the heart, okay?

14:38.988 --> 14:40.484
That's all I had.

14:42.585 --> 14:43.605
You okay?

14:44.858 --> 14:46.690
Just a busy day.

14:47.159 --> 14:48.770
Oh, that's right. Y'all got that

14:48.792 --> 14:51.314
number one song party to go to, huh?

14:52.343 --> 14:54.241
I guess congratulations are in order.

14:54.887 --> 14:57.666
Don't congratulate me. Congratulate Rayna.

14:57.848 --> 15:00.583
Apparently she's the one
who did it all by herself.

15:00.584 --> 15:02.153
She's the superhero,

15:02.154 --> 15:05.759
and I'm the person who just
came in and held her cape.

15:05.835 --> 15:06.849
Yeah, well, that's not what happened.

15:06.850 --> 15:08.508
I remember. I was there.

15:09.459 --> 15:10.493
Yes.

15:12.066 --> 15:13.372
And now you're here.

15:15.124 --> 15:16.977
You know the offer still stands,

15:16.978 --> 15:19.243
that you can come on tour with me anytime.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.178
I appreciate it, but I think I'm just gonna

15:22.179 --> 15:24.155
come off the road for a little bit.

15:24.881 --> 15:26.460
Maybe even the grid.

15:26.643 --> 15:27.932
What? No.

15:28.859 --> 15:31.637
No way. You are way too good of a musician

15:32.107 --> 15:36.102
to hole up and hide behind
patchy facial hair.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.889
You going back to the office?

15:44.102 --> 15:46.294
What'd they say? Well, it
didn't work, the plea.

15:46.295 --> 15:47.217
She'll have to finish rehab.

15:47.218 --> 15:48.126
Then there'll be another hearing

15:48.127 --> 15:50.345
to try to get the criminal charges dropped.

15:50.859 --> 15:52.541
All right. Couple more weeks then.

15:52.542 --> 15:55.172
Still got a free pass today. Why
don't we go do somethin' fun?

15:55.178 --> 15:57.508
I can't. I have to go to that party.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.496
That I have a plus-one to I'm not using.

15:59.497 --> 16:00.801
Why don't you come with me? Yeah?

16:00.802 --> 16:03.473
No, I don't think it's a good
idea to have a rehab patient

16:03.474 --> 16:06.070
at a-an industry party where
there's alcohol everywhere.

16:06.071 --> 16:07.841
World's full of alcohol, Juliette.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.769
I gotta do it sometime.

16:09.770 --> 16:12.101
I mean, isn't that why God
created sparkling water?

16:12.555 --> 16:14.551
I am not gonna be able to hang out either.

16:14.552 --> 16:15.636
I'm gonna have to socialize.

16:15.637 --> 16:16.934
I'm gonna have to talk
to a bunch of people.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.597
That I don't want to talk to. It's okay.

16:18.598 --> 16:19.768
All right, I'll just hide behind her

16:19.769 --> 16:21.891
instead of my patchy facial hair.

16:23.657 --> 16:24.676
Thank you.

16:26.954 --> 16:28.195
Let's all go.

16:28.856 --> 16:29.989
Calista outlined the deal for me.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.849
It's gonna be really hard
for Edgehill to beat

16:31.850 --> 16:32.894
or even come close to.

16:32.895 --> 16:34.150
Well, it's tempting.

16:34.151 --> 16:36.804
You know, and countless' track
record speaks for itself.

16:36.805 --> 16:39.567
But I don't know. There's
something that doesn't feel...

16:39.636 --> 16:42.802
Calista's a visionary. You're a superstar.
What's the problem?

16:42.869 --> 16:46.204
The problem is that it just feels
like it's happening too fast.

16:46.803 --> 16:48.708
And I wish you hadn't
given her those tracks.

16:48.709 --> 16:50.702
Those tracks were not ready to go out.

16:50.703 --> 16:52.665
You should've consulted with me first.

16:52.666 --> 16:55.348
Well, you know, I'm just trying to help.

16:55.349 --> 16:55.980
But if you wanna stay

16:55.981 --> 16:58.904
in something stale, old,
and boring, go for it.

16:58.910 --> 17:00.200
Maybe that's your thing.

17:00.872 --> 17:02.785
Think of Edgehill like your marriage.

17:03.576 --> 17:04.550
The only way to get through it

17:04.550 --> 17:06.780
is by fantasizing about someone else.

17:12.637 --> 17:13.469
What?

17:14.016 --> 17:17.066
I heard his song three times
on the radio yesterday.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.165
Apparently he's the number
one most requested.

17:19.165 --> 17:21.130
Is there no music karma?

17:21.131 --> 17:24.436
What about guys like Gunnar
and Deacon, you guys?

17:24.827 --> 17:26.561
Gunnar's right. Nice guys finish last.

17:26.563 --> 17:27.840
Well, you know what we should do?

17:27.842 --> 17:29.774
Wrap him in a tarp, drop him in a river?

17:30.435 --> 17:31.757
Or band together.

17:32.258 --> 17:33.437
Literally.

17:33.859 --> 17:35.742
You know I'm dying to play with you again.

17:36.148 --> 17:37.666
I can't bail on Gunnar.

17:37.667 --> 17:40.861
And I am not Mr. fabulous
over there, either, so...

17:41.114 --> 17:42.838
I'm talking about you and Gunnar.

17:42.839 --> 17:43.941
You know we need a singer,

17:43.942 --> 17:47.345
and we could use a kick-ass
guitar player as well.

17:48.343 --> 17:49.409
Think about it.

17:49.879 --> 17:52.242
Your songs, our rhythm section.

17:52.243 --> 17:54.349
It'd be a huge win for the good guys.

17:54.883 --> 17:56.540
Just let me run it by Gunnar.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.109
My guys, our amps, your garage.

17:59.110 --> 18:01.103
Oh, just like old times.

18:01.526 --> 18:02.752
To good karma.

18:02.918 --> 18:04.352
Oh, yeah.

18:10.543 --> 18:12.069
The great Rayna James!

18:12.070 --> 18:13.784
Back on top, back in town.

18:13.785 --> 18:15.537
Back for the big party, huh?

18:15.538 --> 18:16.525
Yeah.

18:17.650 --> 18:18.796
What are you doin'?

18:18.898 --> 18:20.765
Uh, well, I'm-a go to the party, too,

18:20.766 --> 18:24.584
and then I'm gonna go to
the cabin for a while.

18:24.585 --> 18:25.961
Looks like a long while.

18:26.734 --> 18:28.584
Oh, yeah. Well...

18:29.590 --> 18:31.544
You know, I just thought I
could use a change, you know?

18:34.127 --> 18:35.720
Guess you read the article, huh?

18:35.923 --> 18:37.262
Bunch of crap, right?

18:37.263 --> 18:38.536
That's what I said.

18:40.589 --> 18:41.768
You wanna talk about it?

18:42.527 --> 18:44.888
Cy's a horse's ass. I quit the band.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.424
End of story.

18:47.086 --> 18:48.343
That's a short story.

18:51.806 --> 18:53.271
You talk to Coleman lately?

18:54.254 --> 18:56.678
What do you mean? Since your family
stomped all over his dreams?

18:56.679 --> 18:58.256
No. Well...

18:58.640 --> 19:00.415
Ray, you wanna ask me
somethin', just ask me.

19:00.646 --> 19:01.525
Uh, all right.

19:01.526 --> 19:04.450
Well, you know, I guess seeing
you like this and all...

19:05.462 --> 19:07.424
It kinda scares the hell out of me, so...

19:07.958 --> 19:09.553
I wanna make sure you're all right...

19:10.022 --> 19:11.906
you're doing your program,
going to your meetings,

19:11.907 --> 19:13.149
stuff like that.

19:13.171 --> 19:15.342
Well, the good news is,
it's not 12 years ago,

19:15.343 --> 19:17.487
so I'm not your responsibility anymore.

19:17.488 --> 19:18.394
I know.

19:20.833 --> 19:22.074
I care about you.

19:22.709 --> 19:23.968
That's awesome.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.588
Why are you so angry with me?

19:26.589 --> 19:29.096
I'm... why am I angry with you?
You don't... yeah.

19:29.261 --> 19:29.836
I don't know, ray.

19:29.837 --> 19:31.430
Maybe it's 'cause every time I turn around,

19:31.431 --> 19:35.139
you're, like, firing me
or breaking up with me

19:35.677 --> 19:36.537
or telling me I need to go see

19:36.538 --> 19:38.593
what's around the next bend in the river,

19:38.594 --> 19:40.845
some crap like that. Maybe that's why.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.989
It's 'cause I want you to be happy.

19:43.858 --> 19:45.757
What, like you're happy with Teddy?

19:46.259 --> 19:47.453
Don't do that.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.436
I forgot to ask you.

19:51.437 --> 19:53.480
Did you ever find out if
he was cheatin' on you?

19:53.662 --> 19:54.728
He isn't.

19:55.918 --> 19:56.856
Well...

19:58.013 --> 19:59.896
I guess you made the
right choice then, huh?

20:00.494 --> 20:01.641
Him over me?

20:03.094 --> 20:05.792
Well, you know I didn't have
much choice in that matter,

20:06.214 --> 20:07.744
'cause you couldn't stay sober.

20:08.052 --> 20:10.211
All I know is that you put me in rehab,

20:10.212 --> 20:12.421
and the next thing I know,
you two are gettin' married.

20:12.724 --> 20:13.329
All right, that's why I know.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.302
I know...

20:15.464 --> 20:16.735
You could've waited for me,

20:18.514 --> 20:19.580
and you didn't.

20:20.254 --> 20:22.433
How many times did I have
to go lookin' for you?

20:22.434 --> 20:23.057
How many times

20:23.058 --> 20:25.200
did I have to drag you out of hotel rooms

20:25.201 --> 20:26.609
'cause you were so wasted

20:26.610 --> 20:29.182
I didn't know if you were drunk or dead?

20:32.016 --> 20:34.321
I didn't know that the fifth time in rehab

20:34.322 --> 20:35.678
was actually gonna take.

20:35.717 --> 20:36.849
You lost faith in me.

20:37.766 --> 20:39.185
You did then, you did now.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.295
I never lost faith in you.

20:41.296 --> 20:42.154
Mm-hmm.

20:42.558 --> 20:44.283
And I have not lost faith in you now.

20:44.635 --> 20:45.944
And you got sober.

20:47.339 --> 20:49.450
But I'll tell you what, it's
conversations like this

20:49.451 --> 20:50.855
that make it so that I can't...

20:51.242 --> 20:52.680
I can't do this with you.

20:53.867 --> 20:55.192
Then don't do it.

21:17.172 --> 21:18.946
So you never know. You need
a song to close the show...

21:18.947 --> 21:19.871
Boom. Number one.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.938
So how many number ones is this now?

21:21.939 --> 21:23.185
I bet you've lost count.

21:23.186 --> 21:24.818
Oh, my gosh. You don't lose count.

21:24.819 --> 21:25.635
But I will tell you,

21:25.636 --> 21:28.190
every single time, it feels damn good.

21:28.196 --> 21:29.333
Just one more, Ms. Barnes.

21:29.334 --> 21:30.657
There you go. Thank you very much.

21:31.733 --> 21:32.593
Hey!

21:34.939 --> 21:36.199
What the hell is that?

21:36.795 --> 21:38.330
Oh. Uh, Juliette,

21:38.331 --> 21:40.202
I-I want you to meet, uh, Adam Wergeles.

21:40.203 --> 21:42.344
He blogs for "country fandom" web site.

21:42.458 --> 21:43.378
Hi, Juliette. Great to see you.
Hi. Good to see you.

21:43.379 --> 21:44.710
Congratulations. Uh...

21:45.224 --> 21:46.345
This song is such a hit.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.037
Our... our readers are dying to know,

21:48.298 --> 21:51.093
were you intimidated by writing
with the queen of country?

21:51.371 --> 21:52.369
Intimidated?

21:52.370 --> 21:53.406
Um, no.

21:53.821 --> 21:56.394
Well... it must've been great, though.

21:56.733 --> 22:00.250
It was a thrill to see her
contribute a bridge to the song.

22:00.253 --> 22:01.834
Oh! Hey, look. Marshall. Marshall, hey.

22:02.126 --> 22:03.289
Marshall, this is Adam.

22:03.527 --> 22:04.136
Hi, Marshall.

22:18.285 --> 22:19.099
Jason?

22:19.503 --> 22:21.436
Nope. I'm calling about him, though.
This his brother?

22:23.008 --> 22:24.152
Who's this? Officer vega

22:24.153 --> 22:25.928
with the bastrop county parole division.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.118
Uh, Jason never made it
to his halfway house.

22:28.826 --> 22:30.613
You picked him up from prison, correct?

22:32.553 --> 22:33.558
Yes, sir, I did,

22:34.392 --> 22:36.295
and I dropped him right
off at the halfway house.

22:36.568 --> 22:38.343
Happen to stop at any
pawnshops along the way?

22:42.745 --> 22:43.958
No, sir, I did not.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.202
Hi.

22:48.732 --> 22:49.799
Listen, um,

22:50.139 --> 22:51.575
I'm in the middle of work right now.

22:52.219 --> 22:53.237
Is there anything else?

22:53.419 --> 22:54.758
Your brother's a fugitive.

22:54.939 --> 22:56.382
If there's anything you
might be keeping from us

22:56.383 --> 22:57.545
to help us bring him in,

22:58.543 --> 23:00.188
you're in violation of the law, too, son.

23:02.161 --> 23:03.198
Copy that.

23:04.368 --> 23:06.693
Hey. Hey.

23:06.745 --> 23:08.279
How are you? I'm all right.

23:09.002 --> 23:10.218
Uh, I thought you had
the night off tonight.

23:10.219 --> 23:11.079
I do,

23:11.450 --> 23:13.398
but I also have a proposition for you.

23:15.034 --> 23:16.023
Okay.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.099
Number one with a bullet, huh?

23:18.343 --> 23:20.099
It's so nice to see you. Thanks for coming.

23:20.136 --> 23:22.965
Of course. He never misses a
chance for a free cocktail.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.374
Hey, anything with "party" in the title,

23:24.375 --> 23:25.396
I'm all about it.

23:25.896 --> 23:27.204
By the way, how's your album coming?

23:27.416 --> 23:30.405
It's good. You know, line
by line, chord by chord.

23:30.406 --> 23:31.701
And you got Liam McGuinnis, right?

23:31.702 --> 23:33.031
Yeah, yeah. He's great.

23:33.032 --> 23:35.023
He's good. It's kinda different.
It's different sounds.

23:35.024 --> 23:37.244
Uh... there's my husband.

23:37.456 --> 23:39.052
Get on over there. All right.

23:40.877 --> 23:41.898
Hi. Well, look at you.

23:42.637 --> 23:43.401
Hey.

23:45.038 --> 23:46.090
Thank you for being here.

23:46.516 --> 23:47.806
You bet. Duty calls.

23:48.449 --> 23:49.998
It means a lot to me that you're here

23:50.002 --> 23:51.009
to give the award.

23:51.010 --> 23:52.818
You know I'm here for more
than just giving that award.

23:52.819 --> 23:53.998
I'm here for those sliders.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.105
Come on. Let's go celebrate. Okay.

23:57.106 --> 23:57.731
This is your night.

23:58.066 --> 23:59.969
?Pretty smile,

24:00.898 --> 24:02.008
?My intuition

24:02.009 --> 24:02.842
where is Deacon?

24:02.843 --> 24:04.325
He is supposed to be watching her.

24:05.465 --> 24:06.535
Excuse me, Juliette.

24:07.385 --> 24:10.122
Mom, you cannot touch every
touch piece of food.

24:10.123 --> 24:12.685
?You can't hide from me

24:11.377 --> 24:12.238
what?

24:13.169 --> 24:14.085
I was just saying hi.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.296
To Juliette Barnes?

24:15.305 --> 24:16.196
Yeah. Why not?

24:16.714 --> 24:17.322
I mean, I've been waiting for you

24:17.323 --> 24:18.887
to introduce me to people all night.

24:19.164 --> 24:20.727
I have been doing that.

24:21.019 --> 24:23.211
Not to a&r guys. I already
have a record deal.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.182
What do I need them for?

24:24.491 --> 24:25.866
I just don't recommend

24:25.867 --> 24:27.672
approaching Juliette Barnes for no reason.

24:27.868 --> 24:29.735
I'm an artist like she is.

24:30.492 --> 24:31.352
There's my reason.

25:12.408 --> 25:14.245
Wait. You went to see Avery play?

25:14.302 --> 25:17.132
Oh, barely. I stayed
for, like, half a song.

25:17.151 --> 25:18.811
Gross. But I was thinking,

25:19.776 --> 25:21.661
us and J.T. and the band,

25:21.662 --> 25:23.183
like, they love the way you play,

25:23.184 --> 25:24.702
and then we could do gigs at the 5 spot

25:24.703 --> 25:26.543
and things like... yeah, look,
I don't know, Scarlett.

25:26.544 --> 25:28.152
Um, I'm in the middle of work,

25:28.153 --> 25:30.241
and I just need some time to think on it.

25:30.242 --> 25:31.327
Okay. Uh...

25:32.306 --> 25:33.943
Is it because it's Avery's old band?

25:34.034 --> 25:35.567
This is not about Avery.

25:35.780 --> 25:37.455
I've got a lot on my plate right now.

25:37.683 --> 25:39.694
I know, and I'm worried about you.

25:40.466 --> 25:41.793
You've been funny since Austin,

25:41.794 --> 25:43.250
and I'm wondering if there's
anything I can do to help,

25:43.251 --> 25:44.750
or can I... do you wanna talk about it.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.537
You know, you wouldn't
even begin to understand.

25:46.911 --> 25:47.978
It's serious.

25:48.703 --> 25:49.416
And I'm not?

25:49.417 --> 25:51.053
No. You... you come bouncin' in here

25:51.054 --> 25:52.334
like this... this band thing

25:52.335 --> 25:53.566
is the most important thing in the world.

25:53.567 --> 25:54.381
No, I didn't think that.

25:54.382 --> 25:56.878
I just thought maybe you'd...
you'd find it exciting

25:56.879 --> 25:58.974
I checked with Deacon. He said
the boys are really good.

25:58.975 --> 25:59.966
Well, that sounds great.

25:59.967 --> 26:01.849
Why doesn't Deacon go
play with 'em then, huh?

26:02.062 --> 26:04.177
It's not like he's playin'
with somebody else.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.998
Um... you know what?
Forget I said anything.

26:08.999 --> 26:10.065
Don't... don't worry about it.

26:10.471 --> 26:11.314
Scarlett.

26:12.101 --> 26:12.995
Wait, hold on.

26:13.682 --> 26:16.142
Hey, Gunnar. Hey, man, this
got dropped off for you.

26:21.379 --> 26:22.907
What? By who?

26:22.908 --> 26:24.120
Some guy named Jason.

26:25.260 --> 26:26.087
When?

26:26.092 --> 26:27.128
Couple hours ago.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.016
Said he was just passin' through.

26:33.053 --> 26:34.443
So as mayor elect

26:34.444 --> 26:36.905
and co-chair of the music
city music council,

26:37.389 --> 26:39.182
we thank you for being ambassadors

26:39.183 --> 26:40.410
on behalf of our city,

26:40.765 --> 26:43.768
and for your contributions to
our greatest export, music.

26:43.998 --> 26:46.586
And it is my honor to present
these awards to you both.

26:46.990 --> 26:48.510
And nothing personal, Juliette,

26:48.511 --> 26:51.994
but especially to the woman
who is always number one...

26:52.830 --> 26:54.155
my wife Rayna Jaymes.

26:55.415 --> 26:56.534
?Don't

26:57.471 --> 26:59.430
?You think I'm under

26:59.431 --> 27:01.098
?This ain't a feel-good

27:01.137 --> 27:05.259
?Everything's fine

27:07.291 --> 27:09.276
whoa. Hey. Excuse me. You okay?

27:09.277 --> 27:10.236
Uh, yeah.

27:10.237 --> 27:11.045
You know, this isn't actually

27:11.046 --> 27:12.644
the... the first time that we've met.

27:12.645 --> 27:15.557
I-I ran into you backstage,
uh, at the opry.

27:15.575 --> 27:16.484
Literally.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.141
I mean, I get it. Must
happen to you all the time.

27:19.142 --> 27:20.629
I'm just kind of getting used to it myself.

27:20.630 --> 27:22.049
You know, the whole star thing.

27:22.645 --> 27:24.068
I signed with Dominic's label.

27:24.069 --> 27:26.504
He's got kind of this urban
take on the music... oh, sorry.

27:26.536 --> 27:27.781
Trying to mix it up some.

27:27.990 --> 27:29.906
You know, I-I'd love for you
to hear it sometime... hi.

27:29.957 --> 27:30.784
If you'd like.

27:30.790 --> 27:32.273
I'm Avery Barkley.

27:32.327 --> 27:34.097
I sing that song "kiss."

27:34.709 --> 27:35.673
Hello. Miss Jaymes, hi.

27:35.674 --> 27:36.421
Hi.

27:36.425 --> 27:38.200
I'm such a big fan of yours.

27:38.201 --> 27:40.085
Oh, thank you so much.

27:40.106 --> 27:41.622
I'm sorry, I've never heard of it.

27:41.924 --> 27:42.646
Mama.

27:42.647 --> 27:44.648
I'm jolene. I'm Juliette's mama.

27:44.649 --> 27:47.739
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry.
Um, sorry. I-I...

27:47.740 --> 27:49.203
mama, stop.

27:50.423 --> 27:51.607
I just wanted to thank her.

27:51.608 --> 27:52.868
Nice to meet you.

27:53.046 --> 27:55.204
You do not need to thank her for anything.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.637
Listen to me. She did not do me any favors.

27:57.638 --> 27:59.287
I was just trying to be nice.

27:59.288 --> 28:00.916
Don't try to be anything.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.708
You're not even supposed to be here.

28:03.239 --> 28:04.802
Is there anything you don't ruin?

28:09.673 --> 28:11.333
Rayna. Liam.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.384
Well, I wondered if I'd be able

28:13.385 --> 28:14.888
to successfully avoid you all night.

28:14.889 --> 28:17.524
Hey, Marshall. Nice party.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.288
Well, over 2 million downloads,

28:19.289 --> 28:20.404
I should be thanking you.

28:21.289 --> 28:22.565
You built this label, Rayna.

28:22.744 --> 28:23.672
We don't wanna lose you.

28:23.673 --> 28:25.044
Word travels fast, huh?

28:25.352 --> 28:26.408
Well, save your breath,

28:26.409 --> 28:28.903
'cause you're not gonna be able
to offer enough to keep us.

28:28.904 --> 28:29.944
Well, respectfully, Liam,

28:29.945 --> 28:31.638
my contract's with Rayna, not with you.

28:31.929 --> 28:34.232
Well, respectfully,
Marshall, we are partners.

28:34.233 --> 28:36.087
I'm guessing you don't
know about the imprint

28:36.088 --> 28:37.848
that countless has offered your partner

28:37.865 --> 28:39.588
if he brings you on as an artist.

28:40.088 --> 28:40.868
What?

28:41.849 --> 28:42.942
Not much of a partnership

28:42.943 --> 28:45.386
if one half's double-dipping and
the other half doesn't know.

28:49.358 --> 28:50.190
Did you lie to me?

28:50.191 --> 28:52.362
That guy is such an ass.

28:52.670 --> 28:54.685
Well, yeah, but who lied, you or the ass?

28:54.686 --> 28:56.121
It's not really a lie.

28:56.398 --> 28:58.105
Besides, it's still great for you.

28:58.430 --> 29:00.189
This isn't great for me. I'm helping you.

29:00.190 --> 29:01.324
That's what you wanted, right?

29:01.325 --> 29:03.259
You came knocking on my door, remember?

29:03.486 --> 29:06.012
The whole reason you have a
career again is because of me.

29:06.013 --> 29:07.689
Is that what you think? Mm-hmm.

29:08.206 --> 29:10.301
'Cause my feeling was it was 'cause of us,

29:10.302 --> 29:11.498
'cause we're partners.

29:11.870 --> 29:13.433
You don't lie to your partner.

29:14.127 --> 29:14.764
Yeah.

29:14.765 --> 29:16.059
Tell that to your husband.

29:18.078 --> 29:19.722
Come on. We are partners.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.115
I'm not doing this.

29:23.133 --> 29:23.838
What?

29:23.839 --> 29:25.532
This partnership is dissolved.

29:25.968 --> 29:28.123
Come on. You're finally
getting something going.

29:28.991 --> 29:30.331
We are. We aren't.

29:31.088 --> 29:32.619
You can't just walk away from me.

29:33.087 --> 29:34.480
From you? Yes, I can.

29:48.914 --> 29:50.564
Is there something going
on with you and Liam?

29:53.924 --> 29:54.701
No.

29:56.914 --> 29:58.142
Except I fired him

29:58.595 --> 29:59.406
'cause he was...

29:59.762 --> 30:02.159
Doing some kind of deal behind my back.

30:03.138 --> 30:03.968
That's it?

30:04.339 --> 30:06.016
Because it looked like
a lot more than that.

30:06.241 --> 30:08.130
I guess another man in my life lying to me

30:08.131 --> 30:09.250
feels like a lot more than that.

30:09.251 --> 30:10.879
Rayna, enough already, okay?

30:12.131 --> 30:15.070
Look, how many times do I have
to apologize for what I did?

30:15.139 --> 30:16.419
I screwed up, okay?

30:16.420 --> 30:18.543
You know it, I know it.
But what else can I do?

30:19.494 --> 30:21.313
You know, I'm here at home holding out hope

30:21.314 --> 30:22.547
that we can fix things,

30:22.548 --> 30:24.721
while you're out there on the
road doing God knows what.

30:24.722 --> 30:26.527
I'm out there on the road
doing God knows what?

30:26.528 --> 30:27.537
You know what I'm out there doing?

30:27.538 --> 30:28.560
Paying for this house, among other things.

30:28.561 --> 30:30.722
Well, yeah. Yeah, and I'm
home raising our daughters,

30:30.723 --> 30:32.925
that's what I'm doing.
Well, I'm standing by you.

30:33.841 --> 30:35.086
I'm not divorcing you

30:35.249 --> 30:36.686
or calling the cops on you.

30:37.072 --> 30:38.220
That's what I'm doing.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.062
I just...

30:42.065 --> 30:43.389
I just wanna know where we stand.

30:44.994 --> 30:46.107
I wanna move forward.

30:46.866 --> 30:49.072
And instead, I'm watching
everyone in the world...

30:49.073 --> 30:50.321
Liam, that new label...

30:50.322 --> 30:51.584
everyone's trying to win you over,

30:51.585 --> 30:52.844
and all I wanna do is win you back.

31:00.209 --> 31:02.174
You know, I think it's complicated.

31:04.433 --> 31:05.485
It's complicated.

31:10.706 --> 31:12.734
Yeah, when I met you,
Deacon had destroyed you.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.956
You'd put him in rehab how many times?

31:18.859 --> 31:20.077
Five. Right.

31:20.611 --> 31:21.453
Five.

31:22.644 --> 31:23.456
You were alone.

31:23.764 --> 31:25.186
I remember you told me you just...

31:27.029 --> 31:28.562
All you wanted was someone solid,

31:30.068 --> 31:31.905
a guy who had his life together, and I did.

31:36.791 --> 31:38.741
You know, then when things
fell apart for me financially

31:38.742 --> 31:41.010
and kept falling apart,
I-I guess I lost my way.

31:41.635 --> 31:44.161
I just wanted to be the guy that
I thought you wanted me to be.

31:45.382 --> 31:47.490
And God knows it doesn't
excuse what I did, but...

31:50.742 --> 31:51.762
I guess at the time,

31:52.965 --> 31:54.673
I thought I was doing it
for the right reason.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.776
Maybe we're not all that different, Rayna.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.177
Wrong choice, right reason.

32:05.029 --> 32:06.592
Maybe that's how we ended up together.

32:13.023 --> 32:15.490
Are you gonna answer me?
Page and plant? Right.

32:15.491 --> 32:16.207
Well, hey.

32:16.275 --> 32:17.520
Hey, hey, hey, killer.

32:17.589 --> 32:18.867
How you doin'? How you doin'?

32:18.868 --> 32:20.351
I'm good. Good.

32:22.356 --> 32:24.801
Hey, guys, I know, like, you're all set up.

32:24.802 --> 32:26.341
You should play here long as you want,

32:26.342 --> 32:27.588
but I did talk to Gunnar about it.

32:27.589 --> 32:28.852
He said the whole joining forces this

32:28.853 --> 32:30.833
wasn't gonna work out. I-I'm sorry.

32:31.285 --> 32:32.866
He just taught us "one works better."

32:33.381 --> 32:34.433
What are you doing here?

32:35.462 --> 32:36.802
Wanted the good guys to win,

32:37.572 --> 32:39.938
even if I don't act like
one myself sometimes.

32:40.568 --> 32:41.528
Whatever it is that's bothering you,

32:41.529 --> 32:42.838
I sure wish you'd talk about it.

32:43.899 --> 32:45.639
I'd rather just play, if that's all right.

32:47.595 --> 32:49.222
It's good to see you got your Gibson back.

32:51.457 --> 32:52.525
All right, you boys ready?

32:52.641 --> 32:53.806
Count it off. Mm-hmm.

32:54.577 --> 32:55.949
Three, four.

32:59.223 --> 33:00.195
Deacon?

33:01.128 --> 33:02.275
Hey!

33:03.879 --> 33:04.966
Deacon?!

33:05.994 --> 33:07.287
Open the damn door!

33:07.515 --> 33:08.554
I know you're in there!

33:08.555 --> 33:10.791
Your piece-of-crap truck's out here!

33:12.428 --> 33:13.564
Where the hell have you been?!

33:16.863 --> 33:17.644
Deacon?

33:18.368 --> 33:19.244
Just go away.

33:19.360 --> 33:20.620
That's not gonna happen.

33:30.944 --> 33:32.124
It was out of tune.

33:38.654 --> 33:40.935
Well, you're too miserable to be drunk.

33:42.891 --> 33:44.683
You know so much, don't you?

33:45.437 --> 33:47.674
I know a dry drunk when I see one.

33:56.094 --> 33:58.394
Look at me. Come with me.

33:58.878 --> 34:00.522
You should be on the road.

34:00.719 --> 34:02.859
You need to be playin', writin' music,

34:03.165 --> 34:05.562
going to meetings, working the program.

34:05.821 --> 34:07.335
Look, there's a group in my crew.

34:07.422 --> 34:08.585
They meet twice a week.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.905
It's a pain in my ass.

34:13.516 --> 34:15.177
But you need to do what you love.

34:18.460 --> 34:19.801
Isn't that why you got sober?

34:22.414 --> 34:23.864
Isn't that what kept you sober?

34:26.623 --> 34:27.512
You know, it's funny.

34:27.513 --> 34:29.187
I always used to say that, uh,

34:29.193 --> 34:31.627
I got sober for myself, you know?

34:32.478 --> 34:33.723
That's what you're supposed to say.

34:36.815 --> 34:37.965
It was never true.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.397
I got sober for Rayna.

34:49.522 --> 34:50.717
What kept me sober...

34:57.167 --> 34:59.529
Was hoping for something that
ain't never gonna happen.

35:01.294 --> 35:03.131
You really think she saved your life?

35:06.723 --> 35:08.406
From an outsider's perspective,

35:09.118 --> 35:11.371
she is the opposite of what you need.

35:13.008 --> 35:14.491
You gonna tell me what I need now?

35:18.004 --> 35:20.146
Don't you got another
addict to go take care of?

35:20.619 --> 35:21.652
I'm serious. I mean, look at

35:21.653 --> 35:24.581
you got all the care and
concern in the world for me,

35:24.582 --> 35:26.866
but what about her, nothin'?

35:30.055 --> 35:30.921
See, I don't get that,

35:30.922 --> 35:32.517
'cause she and me, we're the same.

35:34.043 --> 35:35.015
Yeah.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.559
We're fightin' the exact same battle.

35:39.483 --> 35:40.871
Right now, only difference is...

35:43.323 --> 35:44.949
She's doing a whole lot better than me.

36:01.416 --> 36:03.492
Hey. There you are.

36:06.456 --> 36:07.492
Baby, I'm sorry.

36:08.185 --> 36:11.189
No. No, I'm sorry.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.276
Deacon's in bad shape.

36:14.903 --> 36:16.069
He didn't drink, but he...

36:17.464 --> 36:18.565
Easily could've.

36:21.081 --> 36:23.624
I just feel like if he, of all people,

36:23.625 --> 36:25.124
can fall off the wagon...

36:26.584 --> 36:27.781
Then there's no hope for me.

36:34.232 --> 36:35.493
Listen to me. I...

36:36.936 --> 36:39.460
I should have told the
judge how far you've come.

36:40.088 --> 36:42.884
I mean, that you've stayed in rehab,

36:43.385 --> 36:45.683
the fact that you're even
here in the first place.

36:46.952 --> 36:48.357
I should have told you that I'm...

36:49.225 --> 36:51.845
Really, really proud of you.

36:59.458 --> 37:01.103
You don't know what that means to me.

37:02.275 --> 37:03.567
Somebody like you being...

37:04.180 --> 37:05.455
Proud of somebody like me?

37:06.450 --> 37:08.227
Somebody like me? What
are you talking about?

37:08.228 --> 37:09.519
Baby, I'm in awe of you.

37:10.484 --> 37:12.738
I saw you up on that stage
tonight with the legend,

37:12.739 --> 37:14.115
with the woman that you've admired

37:14.116 --> 37:15.615
since you were a little girl, and...

37:16.180 --> 37:17.424
Now you're her equal.

37:18.916 --> 37:20.007
You think I'm Rayna's equal?

37:20.008 --> 37:22.836
Oh, yeah, and then some.

37:24.072 --> 37:26.711
Baby, she... she grew up in belle Meade,

37:26.712 --> 37:28.579
and, well, you came from...

37:29.481 --> 37:30.372
You came from me.

37:31.481 --> 37:34.487
And you're so amazing and
talented and beautiful.

37:34.488 --> 37:38.324
And... if you can come
from someone like me?

37:38.889 --> 37:41.172
Well, that just proves that there's hope.

37:44.149 --> 37:45.399
I don't tell you that I'm proud,

37:45.400 --> 37:47.990
because then it sounds like
I'm trying to take credit.

37:50.169 --> 37:52.816
But I am. I'm so proud of you.

37:55.541 --> 37:56.324
All th you are

37:56.325 --> 37:58.227
and... and everything you've become, honey,

37:58.228 --> 38:00.017
that's... that's not because of me.

38:01.237 --> 38:02.159
It's in spite of me.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.096
Who you are and where you are, honey...

38:08.917 --> 38:09.968
Baby, that's all you.

38:15.492 --> 38:16.132
I'd have told you,

38:16.133 --> 38:17.711
but I didn't think that what I thought

38:18.084 --> 38:19.184
meant anything to you.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.409
It means somethin'.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.932
?You been working

38:48.933 --> 38:52.103
?lt's too late to change

40:06.899 --> 40:07.871
You be good, too.

40:10.036 --> 40:12.735
Listen, as far as I'm
concerned, we're still married,

40:13.443 --> 40:16.639
whether I'm here in Nashville
or whether I'm out on tour.

40:21.658 --> 40:24.311
I chose you. That was never a wrong choice.

40:28.147 --> 40:29.246
I think now we're just...

40:30.037 --> 40:31.618
Choosing what our future's gonna be.

40:32.900 --> 40:33.758
Right.

40:48.337 --> 40:49.437
Marshall keeps calling.

40:50.462 --> 40:51.565
So does Calista.

40:52.288 --> 40:53.755
They both wanna know where you stand.

40:54.642 --> 40:55.788
I want my own label.

40:56.225 --> 40:58.223
Tell that to Marshall, and if he says yes,

40:58.224 --> 40:59.677
then I will stay at Edgehill.

41:00.529 --> 41:01.676
Okay, so no Calista?

41:01.937 --> 41:03.628
No. Not yet.

41:04.464 --> 41:07.533
Why do we have to do everything
at the crack of butt?

41:10.161 --> 41:11.974
Will you please also tell
him I want my own plane?

41:13.097 --> 41:15.718
All right. So, hey, we
goin' to Kansas City?

41:16.713 --> 41:18.022
Not quite yet.

41:19.035 --> 41:20.455
We're waitin' for one more.

41:26.218 --> 41:27.047
Excuse me.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.318
Deacon. How y'all doing?

41:29.545 --> 41:30.967
Y'all take care, okay? Okay.

41:45.509 --> 41:46.354
Hey.

41:47.621 --> 41:48.754
Sorry for the hold-up.

41:52.805 --> 41:54.742
Did you hire him to replace Liam

41:54.743 --> 41:55.825
and not talk to me about it?

41:55.861 --> 41:57.105
No. Of course not.

41:58.161 --> 41:59.297
I'm not here for your band.

42:02.342 --> 42:03.411
He's joining mine.
