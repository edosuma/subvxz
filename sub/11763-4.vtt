WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:07.007
WHO WANTS TO SEE ME
SWALLOW A SWORD?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.509
(cheering)

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
WELL,
WE'VE ALREADY LOST BOBBY.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.513
I DO.
DAZZLE ME, BROTHER.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.545
WHAT'S UP, GRAYSON?
HEY. HOW YOU DOING?

00:14.545 --> 00:18.289
HI, JULES.
HI, MATT. DO YOU GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER?

00:18.289 --> 00:21.052
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WE PLAY
ROLLER HOCKEY TOGETHER.

00:21.052 --> 00:24.655
HOW DO YOU TWO KNOW
EACH OTHER?
OH, GRAYSON, THERE'S, LIKE,

00:24.655 --> 00:27.027
A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS
THAT PEOPLE KNOW EACH OTHER.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.030
FOR SOME REASON, I-I CAN'T THINK
OF ANY RIGHT NOW, BUT--
OH, YOU TWO SLEPT TOGETHER.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.702
NO.
YES.

00:31.702 --> 00:35.536
YES... BUT IT WAS
JUST ONE NIGHT.
BUT IT WAS A LOT.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.469
NOW IT'S COMING BACK TO ME. YOU
WOULDN'T SHUT UP THEN EITHER.

00:38.469 --> 00:39.810
(mouths word)

00:39.810 --> 00:44.044
WELL, IT'S OFFICIAL.
GRAYSON KNOWS I'M A GIANT HO.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.178
YOU HID IT
FOR AS LONG AS YOU COULD.
YEAH.

00:47.178 --> 00:50.221
WE BOTH SLEPT WITH OTHER PEOPLE
BEFORE WE GOT TOGETHER.
YEAH, WE DID.

00:50.221 --> 00:52.723
YOU REALLY
WANNA HIGH-FIVE THAT?
NO, I DON'T.

00:52.723 --> 00:55.456
LOOK, I DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOUR PAST, ESPECIALLY WITH GUYS

00:55.456 --> 00:58.389
LIKE MATT. (chuckles) HE WEARS
A VISOR TO ROLLER HOCKEY.

00:58.389 --> 01:00.161
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
OHH.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.193
(Andy) OHH!
VISOR DOUCHE.

01:02.193 --> 01:04.735
THANKS FOR BEING SO COOL
ABOUT THIS.

01:04.735 --> 01:06.797
YOU ARE SO AWESOME.

01:06.797 --> 01:09.770
SO, UM,
DO YOU THINK I'M AWESOME?

01:09.770 --> 01:12.103
ISH.

01:12.103 --> 01:14.675
SMITH IS SO AWESOME.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.208
JULES, I'VE NEVER FELT
LIKE THIS.

01:17.208 --> 01:20.511
AW.
I'M IN LOVE,
AND IT'S THE REAL DEAL,

01:20.511 --> 01:24.515
LIKE, KEEP-THE-BABY TYPE
OF LOVE.

01:24.515 --> 01:27.818
I EVEN BREATHE HIS NAME.
SEE?

01:27.818 --> 01:31.192
(exhales deeply) SMITH.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.424
MMM.
(kisses)

01:33.424 --> 01:35.866
OKAY. WE'RE DONE.
ELLIE, GET OUT OF MY PURSE.

01:35.866 --> 01:39.270
I'M BORED, AND YOUR
DRIVER'S LICENSE EXPIRED.

01:39.270 --> 01:41.272
I HAVE TO GET A NEW ONE.

01:41.272 --> 01:44.375
OH, I HOPE I GET TO KEEP
THAT PICTURE.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.677
WHOA. THAT PICTURE'S,
LIKE, 20 YEARS--

01:46.677 --> 01:49.710
TWO YEARS OLD. HOW'D YOU GET
THE D.M.V. TO LET YOU KEEP IT?

01:49.710 --> 01:52.883
THIS GIRL CAN FLIRT.
NO, SHE CAN'T.

01:52.883 --> 01:55.546
BUT I CAN CRY.
YES.

01:55.546 --> 01:58.118
SWEETIE, THE FRESH-FACED GIRL
IN THIS PICTURE DIED

01:58.118 --> 02:01.192
A LONG TIME AGO.

02:01.192 --> 02:03.894
YOU SMOTHERED HER WHEN YOU SLEPT
ON YOUR FACE FOR 20 YEARS.
HARSH, BUT ELLIE AND I
HAVE A PACT.

02:03.894 --> 02:07.898
WE TELL EACH OTHER
THE HARSH TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT.
THAT'S WHY SHE THANKED ME

02:07.898 --> 02:10.901
WHEN I TOLD HER SHE NEEDED
TO WEAR A PADDED BRA,

02:10.901 --> 02:13.334
BECAUSE SOMETIMES HER NERPS
POINT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
SOMETIMES.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.266
I LIKE THE GOOGLY EYES.
(chuckles)

02:15.266 --> 02:16.837
(whistles)

02:16.837 --> 02:19.840
I MEAN, I KNOW I HAVEN'T DONE
GREAT WITH THE LADIES SO FAR,

02:19.840 --> 02:22.543
BUT NOW WITH
MY NEW SOUL FRIEND...

02:22.543 --> 02:24.545
EH-EH-EH! I AM READY.

02:24.545 --> 02:27.678
GIRLS UP AHEAD. DON'T TALK
ABOUT IT. BE ABOUT IT.
DONE.

02:27.678 --> 02:30.150
LADIES.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.323
NO.
RIGHT ON.

02:32.323 --> 02:34.325
YEAH, I NEED A BREAK
FROM COLLEGE GIRLS.

02:34.325 --> 02:36.587
THEY LIKEY TRAVY LONG TIME.

02:36.587 --> 02:40.160
SORRY ABOUT THAT. PLUS,
I THOUGHT I'D SEE KYLIE.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.492
I THOUGHT YOU TWO BROKE UP.

02:41.492 --> 02:43.494
I SAID I'D SEE OTHER PEOPLE
WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL,

02:43.494 --> 02:45.936
BUT WE COULD HANG
WHEN I WAS HOME.

02:45.936 --> 02:49.200
SHE'S MISSING ME BIG-TIME,
SO...
I KNOW I'D BE PINING AWAY

02:49.200 --> 02:52.473
FOR A MAN WHO HAS THE BODY
OF A GIRL GYMNAST.
(chuckles) HEY,
YOU FINALLY CALLED ME A MAN.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.946
(mutters)
SO YOU THINK SHE'S JUST BEEN
WAITIN' AROUND FOR YOU?

02:55.946 --> 02:58.178
(beep, speed dialing)
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT WOMEN.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.850
(telephone rings)

02:59.850 --> 03:02.913
THEY ARE NOT THAT NAIVE,
MY FRIEND.
ONE RING. WHAT UP?
HEY, KYLIE.

03:02.913 --> 03:06.387
(Kylie) Travis! Are you home?
I can't wait to see you!
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.389
HEY. WHOEVER THIS IS,
HE'LL CALL YOU BACK.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.391
WH--TRAVIS,
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.394
WHEN YOU COME HOME, I GET
FIRST "HI" AND FIRST HUG.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.196
WHAT IS ON YOUR CHIN?
JUST A LITTLE FLAVOR.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.369
OH, IT'S SO CUTE.
GRAB HIM!

03:18.369 --> 03:21.832
(whirring)
NO! NO! YOU CAN'T DO THIS!
THIS IS CHILD ABUSE.

03:21.832 --> 03:23.604
(high-pitched voice) WAIT!
STOP MOVING.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.876
YOU GUYS FINALLY READY
TO SEE THIS?
(cheering)

03:25.876 --> 03:27.878
YEAH?
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

03:27.878 --> 03:30.581
I HAVE TO SEE
THIS GUY EAT THE SWORD,

03:30.581 --> 03:33.884
BUT HE KEEPS STALLING,
TRYING TO SUCK PEOPLE IN.

03:33.884 --> 03:35.386
UH...

03:35.386 --> 03:37.388
IS ANYONE HERE FROM TAMPA?

03:37.388 --> 03:39.390
WHO CARES, MAN?

03:39.390 --> 03:41.952
JUST EAT THE SWORD.

03:41.952 --> 03:44.224
EAT THE SWORD!
EAT THE SWORD!

03:44.224 --> 03:47.598
(exhales deeply) SMITH.

03:47.598 --> 03:50.861
OKAY. I WANTED TO, UH,
TALK TO ALL OF YOU.

03:50.861 --> 03:54.405
BEFORE JULES AND I GOT TOGETHER,
I SLEPT WITH LAURIE.

03:54.405 --> 03:56.837
NO WAY!
WHAT?

03:56.837 --> 03:59.940
(Andy) GET OUT OF TOWN!
FIRST OF ALL,
LAURIE, YOU WERE THERE.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.973
(Laurie) OH, RIGHT.
AND, ANDY, YOU KNEW
BUT SWORE ON YOUR LIFE

04:02.973 --> 04:05.676
YOU WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE,
SO I'M ASSUMING YOU TOLD ELLIE.
LIKE, IMMEDIATELY. (chuckles)

04:05.676 --> 04:07.678
A SECRET THAT SPICY?
MUY CALIENTE. (chuckles)

04:07.678 --> 04:09.980
ARE YOU CUBAN TODAY?
YEAH, I WILL BE
IF YOU LIKE IT.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.423
I DO LIKE IT.
OOH.

04:12.423 --> 04:15.426
FUN FOR YOU. AND, SMITH,
I'M SURE LAURIE TOLD YOU, SO...
NO. JUST FINDING OUT NOW.

04:15.426 --> 04:17.758
BUT I'M COOL.
YEAH. KEEP IT MOVING.
VISOR GUY GOT ME TO THINKING

04:17.758 --> 04:20.491
THAT THINGS ARE GOING SO WELL
WITH JULES,

04:20.491 --> 04:23.494
I REALLY WANT TO BE OPEN
WITH HER ABOUT EVERYTHING,

04:23.494 --> 04:26.266
EVEN IF IT MAKES HER
FREAK OUT. (chuckles)

04:26.266 --> 04:28.999
SO I AM GONNA TELL HER.

04:28.999 --> 04:31.001
I KIND OF THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE

04:31.001 --> 04:32.943
THE ONE SECRET
I WOULD TAKE TO THE GRAVE.

04:32.943 --> 04:35.646
'COURSE, I ALSO THOUGHT
I WOULDN'T LIVE PAST 30.

04:35.646 --> 04:37.348
BUT WE CAN STILL HOPE, RIGHT?

04:37.348 --> 04:40.351
NO, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, GRAYSON.

04:40.351 --> 04:42.983
WE SHOULD TELL HER.
IT'S TIME TO EAT THE SWORD.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.285
EAT THE SWORD?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.488
GRAYSON, LET ME TELL HER.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.621
YEAH, I THINK
I'LL HANDLE THIS ONE.

04:50.621 --> 04:52.623
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S GONNA BE LESS ANGRY

04:52.623 --> 04:54.665
AT THE PERSON
WHO TELLS HER FIRST.

04:54.665 --> 04:57.398
(shouts indistinctly)
OH!

04:59.700 --> 05:01.772
(pins clatter)
I HATE JUGGLERS.

05:01.772 --> 05:04.775
GREAT. YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING
FUN, AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN CALL.

05:04.775 --> 05:07.338
OH, I'LL APOLOGIZE
ONCE THIS GOES DOWN.

05:07.338 --> 05:09.540
ISN'T THAT KYLIE?

05:09.540 --> 05:12.312
YEAH.
THAT'S... MY GIRL.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.846
I'M SURE
THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS...

05:15.846 --> 05:17.748
BOOB-TO-BACK FRIENDS.

05:17.748 --> 05:18.949
(whiny voice) MAN.

05:18.949 --> 05:20.991
TRAV, YOU OKAY, BUD?

05:20.991 --> 05:23.724
OH! HE JUST ATE
THAT WHOLE THING!

05:23.724 --> 05:26.527
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
OH, MAN! NO!

05:26.527 --> 05:30.030
(beep)
OKAY, TINA, THAT WAS
YOUR FAULT THAT I BLINKED.

05:30.030 --> 05:33.864
NOW WE AGREED ON ONE AND TWO
AND PAUSE AND SNAP.

05:33.864 --> 05:37.408
MA'AM,
YOU HAVE HAD NINE TRIES.

05:37.408 --> 05:39.910
CAN'T WE JUST USE
MY OLD PICTURE?

05:39.910 --> 05:41.912
IT WAS
MY DEAD MOTHER'S FAVORITE.

05:41.912 --> 05:44.775
I MISS HER
SO MUCH EVERY DAY.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.076
DO I LOOK NEW?

05:46.076 --> 05:48.018
ALL RIGHT. FINE.
LET'S DO IT.
ONE...

05:48.018 --> 05:50.881
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME!
(Grayson) OH, SORRY. SORRY.

05:50.881 --> 05:52.853
TWO... PAUSE...

05:52.853 --> 05:54.725
LAURIE AND I SLEPT
TOGETHER!
I SLEPT WITH GRAYSON!

05:54.725 --> 05:56.657
(beep)

05:56.657 --> 05:58.759
ONE MORE?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.762
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:09.970 --> 06:13.874
YOU KNOW THE WORST THING
ABOUT YOU TWO HOOKING UP?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.576
LOOK AT MY LICENSE!

06:15.576 --> 06:17.678
YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.910
DON'T.
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD YOU.

06:19.910 --> 06:22.052
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU DESERVED TO KNOW.

06:22.052 --> 06:24.915
JULES,
IT WAS A ONETIME THING.

06:24.915 --> 06:27.087
DAMN IT. THEY'RE SAYING
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.790
NO MERCY! CLIMB BACK
INTO THAT GUN TURRET

06:29.790 --> 06:32.463
AND SHOOT
EVERYTHING YOU SEE!

06:32.463 --> 06:34.064
(imitates machine gun)

06:34.064 --> 06:37.628
CLICK. BOINK.
(imitates grenade exploding)

06:37.628 --> 06:38.869
(sighs) HMM.

06:38.869 --> 06:41.602
OH, BOBBY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FEEL BAD FOR ME.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.605
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED
SEEING THAT SWORD GET EATEN.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.678
I'M GOING BACK.
SMITH, YOU IN?
UH, NO, THANKS.

06:47.678 --> 06:49.780
SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE
BEING LOVERS?

06:49.780 --> 06:53.413
LET'S GO. I'LL DRIVE.
I MEAN, I DON'T NEED
THE--THE GRAPHIC DETAILS.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.415
I COULD FIGURE THOSE OUT
MYSELF.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.688
(mouths word)
GRAYSON'S ONLY GOT,
LIKE, TWO MOVES--

06:57.688 --> 06:59.950
I'M UP HERE. I'M DOWN HERE.
(sighs)

06:59.950 --> 07:01.522
BUT WAS IT SPECIAL?

07:01.522 --> 07:02.893
SWEETIE, NO.

07:02.893 --> 07:05.596
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
THAT MIRROR BY HIS BATHTUB,

07:05.596 --> 07:07.998
WE WOULD'VE NEVER EVEN
MADE EYE CONTACT.

07:07.998 --> 07:11.131
(makes cracking sound) WE'RE NOT
GONNA DO THIS, ALL RIGHT?

07:11.131 --> 07:13.964
IF YOU WANNA TALK, WE'LL TALK,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE

07:13.964 --> 07:17.738
AND LET YOU JUST...
TORTURE YOURSELF.
WELL, IT'S JUST SO WEIRD.

07:17.738 --> 07:20.010
BUT YOU WERE GREAT
ABOUT VISOR GUY,

07:20.010 --> 07:22.743
AND I KNOW THIS HAPPENED
BEFORE WE WERE DATING.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.645
I'M GONNA BE OKAY.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.917
THANKS.

07:26.917 --> 07:29.049
NO!

07:29.049 --> 07:31.882
REALLY?
YOU GUYS ARE JUST FRIENDS?

07:31.882 --> 07:34.585
I MEAN, I JUST DON'T DO
MANY PIGGYBACKS

07:34.585 --> 07:36.587
WITH MY BUDDIES, YOU KNOW,

07:36.587 --> 07:38.989
UNLESS ONE OF US IS
REALLY TIRED.

07:38.989 --> 07:42.132
TRAV, IT WAS NOTHING.
COME HERE.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.797
OH. (chuckles)

07:48.999 --> 07:52.002
YOU KNOW, USUALLY I DON'T LIKE
MIDDLE-AGED MEN WATCHING ME

07:52.002 --> 07:55.005
GET DOWN WITH MY LADY, BUT, UH,
THIS TIME IT FELT RIGHT,

07:55.005 --> 07:58.008
SO... NICE TO SEE YOU
AND BOO-YAH!

07:58.008 --> 08:00.080
NOT A FAN OF THE GLOATING,

08:00.080 --> 08:03.083
SO I'M GONNA EAT THE SWORD
AND ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.786
DID KYLIE BITE-KISS YOU
LIKE THAT

08:05.786 --> 08:07.918
BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY
TO COLLEGE?

08:07.918 --> 08:09.620
HMM.

08:09.620 --> 08:12.122
I WONDER
WHERE SHE LEARNED THAT FROM.

08:12.122 --> 08:15.626
(pops lips)

08:15.626 --> 08:19.269
HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

08:19.269 --> 08:22.272
OKAY, WHEN MY HAIR IS PULLED
BACK, DO MY EARS STICK OUT?

08:22.272 --> 08:24.034
NO. THEY'RE CUTE.

08:24.034 --> 08:25.806
ELLIE, HARSH TRUTH.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.008
THEY'RE LIKE ELF EARS.
PUT THEM AWAY.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.011
SORRY. STILL, UH, WALKING
ON EGGSHELLS AROUND YOU.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.243
WELL, STOP. I'M COOL.
(chuckles)

08:33.243 --> 08:35.115
I'M SO NOT COOL.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.949
SO GET MAD.
I'M TRYING TO,
BUT I DON'T HAVE A REASON.

08:38.949 --> 08:41.792
COME ON. GIVE ME A REASON.
CRACK THE CODE.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.894
OKAY. (exhales deeply)
(cracks knuckles)

08:43.894 --> 08:47.027
OKAY.
SO YOU SLEPT WITH GRAYSON'S
FRIEND, AND HE WAS COOL WITH IT.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.730
DIFFERENT PEOPLE GET UPSET
BY DIFFERENT THINGS.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.932
YES, THEY DO.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.935
AND I KNOW THEY WERE HONEST
WITH YOU... EVENTUALLY.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.837
COME ON NOW. BRING IT HOME.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.839
WHY DID THEY TAKE SO LONG
TO TELL YOU?

08:58.839 --> 09:01.712
MAYBE, THANKS TO VISOR GUY, THEY
KNEW YOU COULDN'T BE TOO MAD.

09:01.712 --> 09:03.974
SCHEMERS.

09:03.974 --> 09:05.976
I BET THEY CAME UP
WITH THAT IDEA

09:05.976 --> 09:07.277
WHEN THEY WERE TALKING

09:07.277 --> 09:09.720
BEHIND... YOUR... BACK.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.882
LOOK HOW RED YOUR FACE IS.

09:11.882 --> 09:14.084
VICTORY!

09:14.084 --> 09:15.956
YOU STAY HERE.
I'M GETTING LAURIE!

09:15.956 --> 09:18.629
WHAT'D YOU DO?

09:18.629 --> 09:22.562
I CRACKED THE CODE.
(door opens and closes)

09:22.562 --> 09:26.296
SWORD GUY IS UP NEXT. UNTIL
THEN, WE CAN ENJOY IGUANA GUY.

09:26.296 --> 09:29.299
HOW DOES HOLDING AN IGUANA
MAKE YOU A STREET PERFORMER?

09:29.299 --> 09:33.073
HE CAN MAKE IT POOP IN
HIS POCKET. IT'S PRETTY WILD.
OHH.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.606
THEY BOTH HOLD
YOUR EYE CONTACT.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.980
BESIDES, WOULD YOU RATHER
BE BACK AT JULES',

09:39.980 --> 09:42.182
DEALING
WITH THAT DOODY STORM?

09:42.182 --> 09:44.885
I'VE GOT A RIGHT
TO BE PISSED,

09:44.885 --> 09:47.587
AND I DECIDED THAT
ALL ON MY OWN.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.760
PROUD OF YOURSELF?
VERY.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.162
NOW I NEED TO CHOOSE

09:52.162 --> 09:54.965
WHO WILL HAND OVER
THEIR WINEGLASS AND GO.

09:54.965 --> 09:57.197
OH, SHE'S MAKING IT
LIKE A REALITY SHOW.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.870
GRAYSON...
(gasps) OH.

09:59.870 --> 10:01.331
YOU SLEPT WITH MY FRIEND.

10:01.331 --> 10:04.204
BUT IN YOUR DEFENSE,
WE WEREN'T DATING YET,

10:04.204 --> 10:07.638
AND YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT
I WAS WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

10:07.638 --> 10:09.880
STILL DO. WAY OUT.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.311
DON'T PANDER. LAURIE...
MM.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.644
PICKED HER
FROM THE BEGINNING.

10:13.644 --> 10:17.187
WHEN YOU SLEPT WITH GRAYSON, YOU
DID NOT KNOW THAT I LIKED HIM.

10:17.187 --> 10:20.821
PLUS, I HAD BEEN PUSHING YOU
TO START SLEEPING WITH GUYS

10:20.821 --> 10:24.124
WHO WORE SHIRTS TO WORK.
YOU DREAM SO BIG FOR ME,
JULES.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.126
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
TO EXPLODE FOR MONTHS!

10:26.126 --> 10:27.998
PICK SOMEONE! EAT THE SWORD!

10:27.998 --> 10:31.401
I NOW KNOW WHO I AM MAD AT.

10:31.401 --> 10:33.764
(dramatic music plays)

10:33.764 --> 10:35.866
ELLIE!
(both gasp)

10:35.866 --> 10:38.308
WHAT?! NO.
I'M JUST IN THE AUDIENCE.

10:38.308 --> 10:41.271
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS,
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?!

10:41.271 --> 10:43.974
WHAT HAPPENED
TO "HARSH TRUTHS," ELLIE?

10:43.974 --> 10:46.717
OH, YEAH, ELLIE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:46.717 --> 10:48.719
HA HA HA! KARMA HAPPENED!

10:48.719 --> 10:50.650
YEP. AND HERE COMES
THE CHEERLEADER WITH THE...

10:50.650 --> 10:52.652
(high-pitched voice)
HIGH KICK...

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
(normal voice)
AND THE ROGER... RABBIT.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.186
WELL, THIS ISN'T FAIR.

10:56.186 --> 10:57.858
(tribal music plays)

10:57.858 --> 11:00.831
ELLIE TORRES,
HAND OVER YOUR GLASS.

11:00.831 --> 11:03.033
(tribal music
continues playing)

11:03.033 --> 11:05.365
YOU MAY NOW LEAVE
THE GROUP.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.071
(hisses)

11:16.947 --> 11:18.949
UH... CAN WE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING?

11:18.949 --> 11:20.811
NOW?

11:20.811 --> 11:22.713
YEAH. AH.

11:22.713 --> 11:24.715
I'M LOVING
THE NEW BITE-KISSING,

11:24.715 --> 11:26.887
AND, UH, THE ICE CUBE THING
YOU DID EARLIER--

11:26.887 --> 11:28.959
WAS THAT AN ACCIDENT?
NO. OKAY.

11:28.959 --> 11:31.962
WELL, IT WAS A LITTLE SCARY.
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

11:31.962 --> 11:34.765
ARE YOU SEEING THAT GUY
FROM BEFORE?

11:34.765 --> 11:37.728
I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT SEEING... HIM.

11:37.728 --> 11:39.730
YOU REALLY STRESSED
THE WORD "HIM,"

11:39.730 --> 11:41.932
AS IF THERE WERE
OTHER "HIMS."

11:41.932 --> 11:45.405
YOU MADE THE RULES.
CALM DOWN, SILLY BOY.

11:45.405 --> 11:49.009
(high-pitched voice) AH.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.011
ALL RIGHT.
HE PUT OLIVE OIL ON IT.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.813
THAT MEANS
HE'S GETTIN' CLOSE.

11:52.813 --> 11:56.116
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?
NO, NOT AT ALL.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.388
WHAT? OH. I GET IT.
YOU'RE ALL TORE UP,

11:58.388 --> 12:00.951
'CAUSE YOU FOUND OUT
LAURIE WAS WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

12:00.951 --> 12:04.324
NOPE. JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT
SEEING A GUY SWALLOW A SWORD.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.327
WELL, NOW I KNOW YOU'RE LYING.
YOU'RE WOUNDED, BROTHER,

12:07.327 --> 12:09.930
AND I'M NOT GONNA DROP IT
UNTIL YOU ADMIT IT.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.963
(Jules)
I JUST LOVE OUR GIRL TIME.

12:12.963 --> 12:15.866
OH,
I REALLY LIKE THIS ORANGE.

12:15.866 --> 12:18.008
MAKES ME FEEL FANCY.

12:18.008 --> 12:19.940
THIS DOESN'T WORK
FOR ME!

12:19.940 --> 12:21.942
IT'S YOUR PUNISHMENT.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.944
TONIGHT
WE'RE GONNA DRINK WINE.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.847
WE'RE GONNA SAY MEAN THINGS
ABOUT PEOPLE WE LOVE.

12:26.847 --> 12:30.180
WE MIGHT EVEN EAT
THE CHOCOLATE MANATEE.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.953
NO. YOU AND I BOUGHT THAT
TOGETHER.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.955
YOU GET THE TAIL.
I GOT THE HEAD.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.957
LET'S "LADY AND THE TRAMP"
THIS BITCH.

12:36.957 --> 12:41.061
ANDY, GET OUT OF THERE.
BUT MY--
MY NAILS AREN'T DRY YET.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.033
FINE.

12:43.033 --> 12:46.266
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S IT.
I'M CLOSING THE BLINDS.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.369
JULES KIKI COBB,
DO NOT CLOSE--

12:49.369 --> 12:52.042
JULES.

12:52.042 --> 12:55.976
I'M THE ONE
YOU SHOULD BE MAD AT.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.949
STOP. I FORGAVE YOU.
NOW EAT SOME MANATEE.

12:58.949 --> 13:01.011
BEFORE I MET YOU,
I HAD NO CONSCIENCE.

13:01.011 --> 13:03.013
YOU KNOW, IF A SAW
A HANDICAPPED PARKING SPOT,

13:03.013 --> 13:05.385
I'D TAKE IT,
AND THEN I'D JUST PRETEND

13:05.385 --> 13:08.388
THAT ONE OF MY ARMS WAS DEAD
WHEN I WALKED INTO THE BAR,

13:08.388 --> 13:11.121
LIKE... (grunts)
IS THERE A POINT TO THIS?

13:11.121 --> 13:14.024
WHEN I SLEPT WITH GRAYSON,
I DID KNOW THAT YOU LIKED HIM,

13:14.024 --> 13:16.426
AND I DID IT ANYWAY.

13:16.426 --> 13:19.900
I'M SO SORRY.
PLEASE DON'T HATE ME.

13:21.471 --> 13:25.005
TOLD YOU
YOU SHOULDN'T BE MAD AT ME.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.377
(whispers) SLAG.

13:33.113 --> 13:36.116
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.818
WE HAVE TO TALK THIS OUT.
JULES, DON'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE.
I'M COMING IN.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.820
LAURIE, THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK OUT.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.823
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY FRIEND.
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO YOU.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.125
IT'S OVER!

13:45.125 --> 13:47.197
JULES.
"LAURIE, THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK OUT.

13:47.197 --> 13:49.299
"YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MY FRIEND.

13:49.299 --> 13:52.002
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO YOU.
IT'S OVER."
THANK YOU. GO ON.

13:52.002 --> 13:54.004
BUT YOU LOVE
TO TALK THINGS OUT!

13:54.004 --> 13:56.006
YOU MADE ME TALK
FOR TWO HOURS

13:56.006 --> 13:57.968
WHEN I SAID
YOUR SNEAKERS SQUEAKED.

13:57.968 --> 14:01.912
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU CALLED
THEM MY "SQUEAKERS." NOW GO!

14:01.912 --> 14:05.075
NO. WE ARE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS.

14:05.075 --> 14:08.148
AND I AM NOT LEAVING HERE
UNTIL WE DO!

14:09.419 --> 14:11.451
YOU CAN CLAMP ON
TO THAT CHAIR ALL YOU WANT.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.253
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.255
I DON'T WANT TO SAY
THAT I'M HAPPY,

14:15.255 --> 14:18.258
BUT IF I WERE TO DESCRIBE
MY FEELINGS RIGHT NOW--

14:18.258 --> 14:19.960
(Jules) ELLIE!

14:19.960 --> 14:21.261
COMING!

14:21.261 --> 14:23.894
(whispers) RAIN CHECK.

14:23.894 --> 14:26.997
SO WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO KYLIE?
NOTHING.

14:26.997 --> 14:30.000
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T DECIDED
IF I'M GONNA END IT OR NOT,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.903
SO I JUST WENT WITH IT,
NEW STUFF AND ALL.

14:32.903 --> 14:35.645
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
(inhales deeply)

14:35.645 --> 14:38.178
(high-pitched voice)
MM. AH.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.379
(sobs)

14:39.379 --> 14:41.381
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT IT.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.383
YOU READY TO TALK
ABOUT LAURIE?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.115
BOBBY, IT STILL
DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

14:45.115 --> 14:47.117
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.

14:47.117 --> 14:50.090
THAT'S WHY I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF TEXTING THIS GUY.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.892
(laughs) THERE'S NO GAME?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.425
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU USED MY LOVE
OF ROLLER HOCKEY TO TRICK ME.

14:55.425 --> 14:58.128
UNCOOL, MAN. YOU KNOW
I'M NOT A STRONG SKATER.

14:58.128 --> 15:00.130
GRAYSON HAS A PREDISPOSITION
OF SLEEPING

15:00.130 --> 15:02.572
WITH OTHER GUYS' LADIES.
IT'S A CHARACTER FLAW.

15:02.572 --> 15:06.206
SERIOUSLY? I FELL, LIKE,
TEN TIMES SKATING HERE.
COME ON, YOU TWO.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.338
THIS IS SERIOUS EMOTIONAL STUFF.
CLEAR THE AIR.

15:08.338 --> 15:10.440
ARE WE COOL?
WE'RE COOL.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.243
AWESOME. NOW TURN ME.

15:13.243 --> 15:15.115
(grunts)

15:15.115 --> 15:18.118
PEACE!
I FEEL BETTER. DO YOU?

15:18.118 --> 15:19.619
OKAY, LAST BULLET.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.222
YOU KNOW HOW BAD I WANNA SEE
THIS DUDE EAT SWORD?

15:22.222 --> 15:24.624
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA WATCH
UNTIL YOU ADMIT

15:24.624 --> 15:27.627
THAT THIS IS KILLING YOU.
IT'S NOT KILLING ME,
BOBBY.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.560
YOU KNOW, I-I CAN TELL THAT
LAURIE'S GETTING SERIOUS.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.203
SHE BREATHES MY NAME.
I KNOW. I HEARD IT.

15:33.203 --> 15:35.205
YEAH,
IF I FELT THE SAME WAY,

15:35.205 --> 15:40.070
I-I-I'D BE JEALOUS OR MAD
OR, UH, SOMETHING, RIGHT?

15:40.070 --> 15:42.342
I MEAN,
SHOULDN'T I CARE MORE?

15:42.342 --> 15:44.114
YEAH. YOU SHOULD.

15:44.114 --> 15:46.116
OH, MAN.

15:46.116 --> 15:47.417
THIS SUCKS.

15:47.417 --> 15:50.050
OH! YES! YES!

15:50.050 --> 15:52.983
HANDLE DEEP, BABY!
HANDLE DEEP! WHOO!

15:56.056 --> 15:58.688
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR LIFE,
SMITH.

15:58.688 --> 16:03.133
(drumming loudly)

16:03.133 --> 16:05.996
(loudly) I'M SURE TRAVIS LOVES
WHAT YOU DID TO HIS ROOM!

16:05.996 --> 16:07.497
THIS FEELS GOOD.

16:07.497 --> 16:09.669
IT'S LIKE THE DRUMS ARE
LAURIE'S BODY

16:09.669 --> 16:11.671
AND THE CYMBAL IS HER FACE.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.074
FACE! HEAD! SHOULDER!
BUTT! FACE! BUTT! SHOULDER!

16:14.074 --> 16:15.575
FACE! FACE! FACE! FACE!

16:15.575 --> 16:18.248
(loud drumming resumes)

16:18.248 --> 16:19.749
YOU'RE SITTING WEIRD.

16:19.749 --> 16:22.282
YOU CAN'T GET ME OFF OF HERE.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.285
NOTED. SO, LOOK, EVEN THOUGH
IT WAS MY IDEA... (sighs)

16:25.285 --> 16:27.287
I HATE THAT KYLIE'S
SEEING OTHER GUYS.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.060
I'M GONNA, LIKE,
GET OVER THAT, RIGHT?

16:30.060 --> 16:32.362
(loudly) I FEEL THAT
IF YOU CARE ABOUT SOMEONE,

16:32.362 --> 16:35.425
YOU CAN GET THROUGH ANYTHING!
THAT'S A LITTLE LOUD.

16:35.425 --> 16:38.168
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
SORT OF A WEIRD VIBE HERE,

16:38.168 --> 16:40.670
BUT I'M JUST GONNA PLOW
THROUGH IT.

16:40.670 --> 16:42.672
EVERYONE DESERVES
A SECOND CHANCE!

16:42.672 --> 16:45.004
(Jules) SCREW IT, TRAVIS!
DUMP HER!

16:45.004 --> 16:46.306
SHE'S A BETRAYER!

16:46.306 --> 16:48.007
FACE!
(beats bass drum)

16:48.007 --> 16:50.009
WHO ARE YOU PUNISHING?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.342
(loud drumming resumes)
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.

16:52.342 --> 16:55.014
(grunts)

16:56.486 --> 16:59.018
WHOA.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.522
IT FEELS LIKE
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.524
JULES, YOU'RE NOT GONNA END
YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH LAURIE.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.526
YOU DON'T CUT PEOPLE
OUT OF YOUR LIFE.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.558
IT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE.

17:08.558 --> 17:10.560
I CAN BE MEAN, GRAYSON.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.702
LOOK.
TRAVIS' FAVORITE POSTER.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.068
OH, GOD.
I THINK I'M GONNA VOMIT.

17:18.068 --> 17:21.341
ELLIE, HARSH TRUTH--

17:21.341 --> 17:23.113
CAN I DROP LAURIE?

17:23.113 --> 17:26.045
DON'T USE MY POWERS
AGAINST ME. IT'S NOT FAIR.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.248
HARSH TRUTH.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.550
YOU CAN'T. YOU LOVE HER.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.051
RIGHT.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.624
BECAUSE I'M
EVERYBODY'S DOORMAT.

17:34.624 --> 17:38.188
AND I TAKE IT, WHETHER IT'S
YOU KEEPING SECRETS FROM ME,

17:38.188 --> 17:42.192
OR YOU, GRAYSON, HAVING SEX
WITH ALL OF MY FRIENDS.

17:42.192 --> 17:45.135
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO AHEAD?
DO ELLIE.

17:45.135 --> 17:46.836
NO, THANK YOU.
YEAH, RIGHT.

17:46.836 --> 17:48.838
I'M SO SICK
OF FORGIVING EVERYONE

17:48.838 --> 17:50.800
FOR EVERYTHING.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.502
IT'S MY WORST QUALITY.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.575
NO, IT'S YOUR BEST QUALITY,
AND IT'S WHY WE ALL LOVE YOU.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.578
I MEAN, WE KNOW
IF WE RAN OVER YOUR DOG--

17:58.578 --> 18:00.680
I DON'T HAVE A DOG.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.682
FINE.
IF WE LEFT--I DON'T KNOW--

18:02.682 --> 18:04.684
ROLLERBLADE TRACKS ALL OVER
YOUR HARDWOOD FLOORS...

18:04.684 --> 18:09.119
IF ANY OF US WERE HURTING,
YOU'D STILL BE THERE FOR US.

18:09.119 --> 18:10.820
WELL, NOT THIS TIME,

18:10.820 --> 18:12.762
AND NOT FOR HER.

18:12.762 --> 18:16.596
NOW HELP ME FIND SOME TAPE
SO I CAN FIX HIS POSTER.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.228
OH, BROTHER.

18:18.228 --> 18:21.771
OH! I'M SO GLAD
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

18:21.771 --> 18:23.433
(sobs) BUDDY.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.135
MM.

18:25.135 --> 18:28.578
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO HUG ME BACK.

18:28.578 --> 18:30.240
CAN WE TALK?

18:31.811 --> 18:34.684
SO I'M GONNA BREAK UP
WITH KYLIE.

18:34.684 --> 18:38.117
YEP. SHE'S GONNA MISS THIS!

18:38.117 --> 18:41.351
I'M NOT BEING A PERV.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS BELT.

18:41.351 --> 18:43.893
IT'S HERS,
BUT I'M GONNA KEEP IT.

18:43.893 --> 18:47.797
IT'S ADORABLE THAT YOU THINK
YOU HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THIS.

18:47.797 --> 18:50.800
YEAH, WELL, I'M IN CHARGE
OF WHAT HAPPENS IN MY OWN LIFE.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.433
(horn honks)
(Kylie) TRAVIS, LET'S GO!

18:53.433 --> 18:56.466
I'LL GO WHEN I WANNA GO.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.710
(honk)
OKAY, I WANNA GO NOW.

19:00.710 --> 19:03.142
(mouths word)

19:05.545 --> 19:07.647
HEY!
MADE MYSELF A DAGWOOD.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.148
OF COURSE YOU DID.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.151
AND LAURIE CARES SO MUCH
ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIP, SHE LEFT.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.324
YOU GUYS WANTED HER
TO GET OFF SCOT-FREE.

19:14.324 --> 19:16.726
SHE'S NOT GETTIN' OFF
SCOT-FREE.

19:16.726 --> 19:18.828
(sighs) LOOK...

19:18.828 --> 19:21.261
LAURIE, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE A GREAT GIRL,

19:21.261 --> 19:23.263
AND--AND WE HAD FUN.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.935
(sighs) IT'S JUST, UH,

19:25.935 --> 19:27.637
I-I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING

19:27.637 --> 19:29.899
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS...

19:29.899 --> 19:33.673
REALLY GOING ANYWHERE,
AND--

19:33.673 --> 19:36.906
(crying)
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

19:36.906 --> 19:40.710
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO.

19:40.710 --> 19:44.384
I KNOW I SAID
WE SHOULD SEE OTHER PEOPLE,

19:44.384 --> 19:46.386
BUT I JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT,
OKAY?

19:46.386 --> 19:49.389
AND MAYBE IT'S MY FAULT
FOR NOT BEING MATURE ENOUGH.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.362
MAYBE IT'S YOURS FOR TURNING
INTO A GIANT HO-BAG.

19:52.362 --> 19:55.225
WHO'S TO SAY? EITHER WAY,
I WANT TO BREAK UP.

19:55.225 --> 19:59.198
NO.
WASN'T REALLY A QUESTION.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.500
WE'RE NOT BREAKING UP.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.273
I LIKE SAYING I HAVE
A COLLEGE BOYFRIEND.

20:03.273 --> 20:05.775
FINE. WE DON'T HAVE
TO BREAK UP,

20:05.775 --> 20:08.207
BUT THEN YOU CAN'T SEE
OTHER GUYS.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.911
(chuckles) SURE, I CAN.
GET IN THE CAR.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.384
TRAVIS,
JUST EAT THE SWORD.

20:14.384 --> 20:17.547
(man)
в™Є SOMEHOW, SOME WAY, SOMEWHERE в™Є

20:17.547 --> 20:20.850
в™Є IT ALL MEANS NOTHING
IF YOU GOT NO HEART в™Є

20:20.850 --> 20:22.552
в™Є AND I SAY в™Є

20:22.552 --> 20:26.656

20:29.699 --> 20:31.901
(crying)

20:31.901 --> 20:33.603
OH, YOU KNOW LAURIE.

20:33.603 --> 20:36.836
SHE'LL BE FINE.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.838
NO.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.541
SHE LOVES HIM.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.443
SHE TOLD ME.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.845
(sobbing)

20:45.845 --> 20:50.720
в™Є LA, DA, DEE, DA, DEE, DA в™Є

20:50.720 --> 20:53.923
в™Є LA, DA, DEE, DA,
DEE, DA в™Є

20:53.923 --> 20:57.987
в™Є LA, DA, DEE, DA, DEE, DA в™Є

20:57.987 --> 21:02.992
в™Є IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THE SIZE OF YOUR HEART в™Є

21:08.898 --> 21:11.040
TRIPPING!
(man) HERE IT GOES!

21:11.040 --> 21:13.272
HIGH STICK!

21:13.272 --> 21:15.505

21:15.505 --> 21:17.907

21:17.907 --> 21:19.679
TRIPPING!

21:19.679 --> 21:20.880

21:20.880 --> 21:23.883
YOU TOUCH THE PUCK TODAY?

21:23.883 --> 21:25.885
NO. UNH-UNH, NOT TODAY.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.558
BUT, UH, BUT I'M GOING TO.

21:28.558 --> 21:29.859
(chuckles)

21:29.859 --> 21:32.922
STUPID VISOR. (chuckles)
