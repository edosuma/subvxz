WEBVTT

00:14.847 --> 00:16.933
Okay, ladies, move out.

00:20.937 --> 00:21.938
Follow me.

00:26.317 --> 00:28.027
Come on, Amy, let's go.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.028
Let's ditch.

00:29.028 --> 00:29.779
Okay.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.158
Where did you get those?

00:34.158 --> 00:35.701
My mom's purse.

00:35.701 --> 00:37.370
You are so busted.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.746
She won't know the difference.

00:38.746 --> 00:40.081
She doesn't even
know I'm here today.

00:40.915 --> 00:41.958
Come on, hurry up.

00:46.420 --> 00:47.380
Dork.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.422
Shut up.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.229
Well, we've got a Jane Doe.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.940
I guess she could
be a runaway.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.110
She's not a street kid.
Not with these nails.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.152
Hit-and-run?

01:10.152 --> 01:13.948
I don't think so. She's too far from
the road to be tossed by a car.

01:14.699 --> 01:18.494
Looks like she's been hit by every
bug in South Florida, though.

01:18.494 --> 01:20.997
Poor baby's been eaten alive.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.748
Smells like beer.

01:22.748 --> 01:25.334
You are much too young
to be out drinking, sweetheart.

01:25.334 --> 01:28.462
Maybe the poor thing was
just coming home from a party.

01:28.462 --> 01:32.216
She hasn't been here that long.
Check her lividity.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.263
I've got double-lividity.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.348
Her blood settled twice.
She's been moved.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.475
Then it's a body dump.

01:41.475 --> 01:45.646
So we are in search
of a crime scene.

02:22.391 --> 02:25.520
1x11 Camp Fear

02:36.103 --> 02:37.063
Calleigh, please.

02:37.063 --> 02:38.105
Coming.

02:43.861 --> 02:44.820
Hmm ...

02:46.906 --> 02:47.949
What do you think of this?

02:49.408 --> 02:51.911
Okay, well ...

02:51.911 --> 02:55.748
faint tread impression, knobby tire,
narrow track width.

02:55.748 --> 02:57.959
Put it all together, it spells ATV.

02:57.959 --> 03:00.127
Pretty fragile, though.
You think you can cast them?

03:02.630 --> 03:03.673
Hair spray.

03:03.673 --> 03:05.132
I like it.

03:18.062 --> 03:20.690
Detective Delacroix says
guy's a wharf rat.

03:20.690 --> 03:22.108
So do we have a name on him?

03:22.108 --> 03:23.818
Willie Stango.

03:23.818 --> 03:25.820
His ex-wife came by this
morning to check up on him.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.155
Said he'd been ducking
her calls for a week.

03:29.198 --> 03:30.283
Ugh.

03:31.534 --> 03:33.077
Okay, that's bad.

03:37.081 --> 03:39.375
Oh, god, it smells well done.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.418
Well done.

03:48.843 --> 03:51.971
Oh, yeah. That looks like
someone torched him.

03:54.056 --> 03:56.142
No signs of forced entry.

03:57.435 --> 03:58.686
Probably someone he knew.

03:59.562 --> 04:00.938
Like a bitter ex-wife?

04:06.235 --> 04:07.278
Got milk?

04:09.280 --> 04:10.615
It's all over the place.

04:25.838 --> 04:26.923
A cell phone.

04:27.340 --> 04:28.382
It's still working.

04:32.970 --> 04:34.430
Lots of missed calls.

04:34.430 --> 04:36.098
That's a good place to start.

04:36.098 --> 04:39.477
Liver temp says she died between
three and five this morning.

04:39.477 --> 04:42.230
Welts on her body appear
to be insect bites:

04:42.230 --> 04:45.149
ants, mosquitoes,
god knows what else.

04:45.149 --> 04:50.363
Blunt force trauma to the right aspect
of the forehead an inch from the midline.

04:51.155 --> 04:55.159
Blood loss could've led to endotoxic
shock but I'll have to do more testing.

04:55.159 --> 04:57.912
Okay, so somebody hit
her and dumped her.

04:57.912 --> 05:00.540
The cause of death is still uncertain.
Could've been an accident.

05:00.540 --> 05:04.377
Teenage girl doesn't wind up by the side
of the road dead and it'd be an accident.

05:04.377 --> 05:05.628
What about sexual assault?

05:05.628 --> 05:08.756
Minor vaginal tearing
around the opening.

05:09.382 --> 05:10.424
And this.

05:11.425 --> 05:12.468
Diaphragm.

05:13.636 --> 05:16.180
Fifteen years old and she
was planning on having sex.

05:16.180 --> 05:17.223
Or someone was.

05:18.266 --> 05:20.351
Maybe someone who
didn't get their way.

05:21.602 --> 05:23.271
Here's the tox you wanted.

05:23.604 --> 05:26.190
Oh, okay.
Cool room.

05:28.985 --> 05:30.444
Ruben, have you
seen Megan?

05:30.444 --> 05:31.946
She had court today.

05:34.031 --> 05:35.783
I thought she had
court yesterday.

05:37.368 --> 05:39.245
She stopped by,
told me to give you this.

05:45.209 --> 05:48.379
Uh, your Jane Doe's blood
alcohol was 0.0.

05:48.379 --> 05:49.297
What?

05:49.755 --> 05:52.425
So she smelled of beer but
didn't drink any? Okay, that's odd.

05:52.425 --> 05:55.803
Not as odd as this -- her pro-time's
up to about 25 seconds.

05:57.179 --> 05:58.723
Her blood wasn't clotting?

05:58.723 --> 06:00.725
Well, she could've been
taking a blood thinner.

06:00.725 --> 06:01.559
I'm still running more tests.

06:01.559 --> 06:04.687
No, a blood thinner would've
caused extensive bruising.

06:04.687 --> 06:07.189
Especially with her injuries.
And there's not a bruise on her.

06:07.189 --> 06:10.693
We've got no ID, no primary crime
scene and no cause of death, right?

06:10.693 --> 06:12.236
Pretty much sums it up.

06:13.070 --> 06:16.407
Well, we know she was doing
one thing before she passed away.

06:16.407 --> 06:17.783
She was breathing.

06:17.783 --> 06:20.411
Yes, breathing air filled
with contaminants.

06:20.411 --> 06:23.331
I'll swab her nasal passages
and sinus cavities.

06:23.331 --> 06:26.167
Okay. Keep me posted.

06:43.142 --> 06:47.438
Tread marks are from DTP
mud gator's quad-claw design.

06:47.438 --> 06:50.441
Standard issue on
650 series ATVs.

06:50.441 --> 06:52.818
Got some nice
scuffing on the outside ribs.

06:52.818 --> 06:56.155
Nice work. I've got a standard
issue situation here, too.

06:56.155 --> 06:57.532
I think it's some
type of, uh ...

06:59.742 --> 07:01.827
uniform.

07:02.119 --> 07:06.040
It's a laundry mark used to separate
identical quantities of clothing.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.125
An invisible laundry mark,

07:08.125 --> 07:11.587
just like our Jane Doe who's not been
reported missing yet, has she?

07:11.587 --> 07:15.716
Detective Sevilla has blanketed all
the local agencies with her pictures,

07:15.716 --> 07:16.467
but no hits yet.

07:16.467 --> 07:17.552
Okay.

07:19.929 --> 07:20.972
By the way ...

07:22.139 --> 07:23.391
a present for you from Alexx.

07:25.685 --> 07:26.686
Nasal mucus.

07:27.228 --> 07:29.021
And it isn't even my birthday.

07:29.021 --> 07:30.064
Sorry about that.

07:33.609 --> 07:35.194
Hey.
Hey.

07:36.237 --> 07:37.655
You mind if I observe?

07:37.655 --> 07:39.323
When have I ever?

07:45.162 --> 07:48.291
So, Mr. Observer,
what do you see?

07:50.501 --> 07:53.504
Uh, partial thickness burns ...

07:54.547 --> 07:57.967
... of the lips, tongue
and oral mucosa.

07:59.010 --> 08:02.513
Stomach lining appears
to be red and inflamed.

08:02.513 --> 08:04.098
What about the lungs?

08:06.934 --> 08:11.564
Swelling of the main stem bronchi.
Release of edema fluid.

08:11.564 --> 08:12.481
Meaning?

08:12.481 --> 08:15.651
Meaning he was
fried from the inside.

08:15.651 --> 08:19.822
And the heat from the burns
blocked off his airway.

08:20.072 --> 08:24.035
Not bad, not bad at all.

08:24.035 --> 08:27.580
You know, Speed, anytime you want
to cross over to our side of the street ...

08:28.039 --> 08:29.832
Do you have any idea
what could've caused it?

08:29.832 --> 08:31.667
No. We're running tox.

08:31.959 --> 08:34.794
But if you want first dibs
on the stomach lining...

08:34.794 --> 08:35.837
Well, yeah.

08:44.764 --> 08:47.767
Great thing about the
nose is it acts like a filter.

08:47.767 --> 08:49.435
Everything we breathe gets
trapped inside --

08:49.435 --> 08:52.146
spores, dirt, live dust mites ...

08:52.046 --> 08:55.049
Ugh. Remind me
never to breathe again.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.260
Bingo.
That's pollen.

09:03.724 --> 09:04.684
Excuse me.

09:05.726 --> 09:07.145
You get something
on the laundry mark?

09:07.145 --> 09:08.938
Yes, Pharos Academy...

09:08.938 --> 09:11.566
a juvenile detention camp
for girls in Southwest Dade.

09:11.566 --> 09:12.817
Ah, tough love.

09:12.817 --> 09:14.861
Parents ship their children off
when they lose control.

09:14.861 --> 09:16.362
Last chance before
the courts get involved.

09:16.362 --> 09:17.905
Yes, well, now we're involved.

09:47.769 --> 09:49.979
At least we know what
Jane Doe was running from.

09:49.979 --> 09:53.483
Sergeant Marcus Cawdrey, Horatio Caine,
Calleigh Duquesne, Miami Crime Lab.

09:53.483 --> 09:54.484
How do you do, Sergeant?

09:54.484 --> 09:57.195
Hello.
Pleasure.

09:57.195 --> 09:59.906
There's been no crime committed on
this property. I can tell you that.

09:59.906 --> 10:02.408
Well, how about a couple
of miles up the road?

10:02.408 --> 10:04.494
We found one of your girls.

10:05.953 --> 10:09.290
Well, that's not one of my cadets.
I've never seen that girl before.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.958
This is not one of your girls?

10:10.958 --> 10:12.001
No, sir.

10:20.718 --> 10:21.803
Excuse me.

10:23.679 --> 10:26.599
Sergeant Cawdrey, how many
ATV's do you have on this ...

10:26.599 --> 10:27.850
Take a look at this.

10:30.978 --> 10:31.896
It's a match.

10:32.939 --> 10:36.400
It also means that we're
going to be here for a while.

10:46.651 --> 10:49.362
I don't know how that ATV
got off property.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.989
Access is strictly
limited to instructors.

10:51.989 --> 10:53.908
What about this young
lady right over here?

10:53.908 --> 10:56.661
Senior Cadets are
considered part of our staff.

10:58.746 --> 11:00.540
Okay, we'll need
a list of those names.

11:00.540 --> 11:01.958
These girls are minors.

11:01.958 --> 11:04.252
I can't give you  anything
without parental permission.

11:04.252 --> 11:06.796
Okay, we'll get it right after
we inform their parents...

11:06.796 --> 11:09.048
they're part of an ongoing
murder investigation.

11:09.048 --> 11:11.134
Now, let's talk about the
property for a minute, Sergeant.

11:11.134 --> 11:12.635
I noticed that you
don't have a fence.

11:12.635 --> 11:15.221
In life there are no fences.

11:15.221 --> 11:18.057
We rely on a
strict code of discipline.

11:18.057 --> 11:19.725
We monitor everything
these girls do.

11:19.725 --> 11:21.686
We tell them when to eat,
sleep and shower.

11:21.686 --> 11:22.937
When to go to the bathroom?

11:22.937 --> 11:26.983
Yes, ma'am. Extreme problems
require extreme measures.

11:26.983 --> 11:29.068
And do those measures
ever get too extreme?

11:29.402 --> 11:32.613
That can never happen.
We have safety protocols in place.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.033
Do you recognize this shirt?

11:37.910 --> 11:39.537
Looks like one of ours.

11:39.537 --> 11:40.705
And the number?

11:42.582 --> 11:43.666
Barracks two.

11:47.628 --> 11:48.379
Ladies ...

11:48.379 --> 11:49.672
Sergeant on deck!

11:51.757 --> 11:52.842
Heads down!

11:53.384 --> 11:55.511
This won't be necessary,
Sergeant.

11:55.511 --> 11:59.182
We have to earn the right to face
others with dignity and respect, sir.

11:59.182 --> 12:02.894
Senior Cadet Barreiro is one
of our success stories.

12:02.894 --> 12:06.105
She used to steal, fight and
disrespect her parents.

12:06.105 --> 12:09.817
Now she's planning on going to
college. Isn't that right, Senior Cadet?

12:09.817 --> 12:11.110
Yes, Sergeant!

12:11.110 --> 12:12.487
Congratulations, Cadet.

12:12.487 --> 12:16.157
Now, sergeant am I to understand the
young ladies are issued uniform shirts?

12:16.157 --> 12:17.492
Yes, sir. Three.

12:17.492 --> 12:20.620
Three shirts. What is the significance
of the single yellow bar.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.497
Denotes a cadet first class, sir.

12:22.497 --> 12:24.123
Okay, could I see them, please?

12:24.123 --> 12:24.957
Yes, sir.

12:24.957 --> 12:28.085
Cadet first class,
locker inspection!

12:43.559 --> 12:46.395
Cadet Julie Morales,
sir, front and center.

12:49.524 --> 12:52.026
Cadet Morales,
you're missing a shirt.

12:52.026 --> 12:53.110
Where's your third shirt?

12:53.110 --> 12:55.404
Sir, this Cadet does
not know, sir.

12:56.989 --> 12:58.866
Okay, maybe I can be helpful.

13:00.493 --> 13:03.788
We believe that we found the
missing shirt on this young lady.

13:03.688 --> 13:05.356
Does she seem familiar to you?

13:06.816 --> 13:08.234
Sir, no, sir!

13:08.943 --> 13:10.069
Okay.

13:10.069 --> 13:12.363
I'm going to go through
your locker, okay?

13:27.837 --> 13:29.088
Is this your boyfriend?

13:31.674 --> 13:34.469
No, that's my brother.

13:34.469 --> 13:35.511
Eyes front, cadet!

13:53.404 --> 13:54.447
Horatio.

13:57.325 --> 13:58.868
Same color as Jane Doe's.

13:58.868 --> 14:00.036
Yes, it is.

14:02.663 --> 14:06.000
Sergeant, we're going to have
to process this whole barracks.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.710
On what grounds?

14:07.710 --> 14:09.045
Bad hair day.

14:40.410 --> 14:41.577
What have you got?

14:43.454 --> 14:44.497
I'm not sure.

14:45.832 --> 14:46.999
I'm not sure about any of this.

14:46.999 --> 14:51.504
I hear you. Like, why would anyone
sneak into a detention camp?

14:51.504 --> 14:52.922
Maybe she was desperate.

14:52.922 --> 14:55.007
Is this going to take much longer?

14:58.094 --> 15:00.179
My girls need to get
back to their routine.

15:00.471 --> 15:03.349
Actually, uh ...
actually, we are finished.

15:03.349 --> 15:06.602
I am going to need one
other thing, though.

15:12.442 --> 15:13.776
I need your belt
and your pants.

15:14.819 --> 15:15.945
What for?

15:16.779 --> 15:18.364
Why don't you tell me?

15:26.372 --> 15:30.793
Managed to extract one hundred
incomings from Willie's cell phone.

15:30.793 --> 15:33.296
Delacroix's tracking them
through teleshore.

15:33.296 --> 15:37.467
So, Mr. Wizard, you, uh ... any
idea yet what killed our guy?

15:37.759 --> 15:39.427
Yeah, he had gas.

15:41.345 --> 15:44.474
Gasoline to be more precise. All the
way down to his stomach lining.

15:47.393 --> 15:49.687
Someone poured gas down
his throat and lit him up.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.856
Human molotov cocktail.

15:51.856 --> 15:54.984
The interesting thing about that sample is
that it has trace amounts of sodium.

15:55.234 --> 16:00.323
I see. Sodium and gasoline
comes from saltwater contamination.

16:00.323 --> 16:02.200
There's a lot of gas
around that marina.

16:03.201 --> 16:04.702
You think Willie Stango
owned a boat?

16:04.702 --> 16:05.953
Could be.

16:05.953 --> 16:07.747
Could be?
Could be.

16:08.790 --> 16:09.957
Let's go find out.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.127
Never fumed one
of these before.

16:13.961 --> 16:15.254
Talk to me, guys.

16:16.506 --> 16:18.758
Tested the diaphragm for semen.
Negative.

16:18.758 --> 16:20.301
But then I thought
I spotted a partial ...

16:20.301 --> 16:21.761
He spotted more than that.

16:21.761 --> 16:24.305
Jane Doe's print on
her own diaphragm.

16:24.305 --> 16:25.390
Hardly the crime of the century.

16:25.390 --> 16:26.933
Not just her prints.

16:28.017 --> 16:29.685
Plural.
Two sets.

16:30.853 --> 16:32.105
Two sets?

16:32.397 --> 16:33.439
Interesting.

16:49.414 --> 16:53.501
The substance on Marcus's zipper
is definitely human blood.

16:53.501 --> 16:56.003
DNA is on it right now.

16:56.003 --> 16:57.964
Well, tell them
there's more coming.

16:57.964 --> 17:01.509
There's some evidence
of a wipe-down,

17:01.509 --> 17:04.011
but dollars to donuts
this blood's from our vic.

17:07.890 --> 17:10.518
Yeah, but we still don't know
where she was killed.

17:10.518 --> 17:11.394
Or who killed her.

17:11.394 --> 17:12.310
That's correct.

17:12.310 --> 17:16.065
You know what, swab the intake system
and the air filter. ATV's got to breathe, too.

17:16.566 --> 17:18.651
Yeah, Horatio.

17:21.404 --> 17:22.446
Okay.

17:22.946 --> 17:25.241
Our victim's name is Dara Winters.

17:25.241 --> 17:28.161
Her mother just filed a missing persons
report less than two hours ago.

17:28.161 --> 17:29.704
She was a teen model.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.418
She was so beautiful.

17:36.794 --> 17:37.879
Yes, she was.

17:39.130 --> 17:43.009
We were planning a trip to Milan.
It was her first time.

17:44.052 --> 17:46.387
When was the last time you
saw your daughter, Mrs. Winters?

17:47.013 --> 17:49.265
Last night, about eight o'clock.

17:49.932 --> 17:51.267
She was going out
with some friends.

17:51.642 --> 17:53.311
I'm going to need those names.

17:55.188 --> 17:56.856
Do you remember
what she was wearing?

17:58.483 --> 18:03.696
A red halter top, a black miniskirt.
Actually, we argued about it.

18:04.322 --> 18:05.698
You had a fight?

18:09.285 --> 18:11.496
Why did it take you so long
to report her missing?

18:11.496 --> 18:14.540
Sometimes I wouldn't see
my daughter all morning.

18:14.540 --> 18:18.211
But in the afternoon, I called some
of her friends then I called the police.

18:19.545 --> 18:21.672
Did she have a
friend named Julie Morales?

18:22.298 --> 18:24.425
Julie Morales?
No.

18:24.425 --> 18:28.304
Because we believe she was
at a Juvenile Detention Camp ...

18:28.304 --> 18:29.430
named Pharos Academy.

18:29.430 --> 18:32.058
A detention camp?
Why would she be there?

18:32.058 --> 18:34.102
I don't know.
Maybe to visit a friend.

18:34.519 --> 18:35.937
I don't think so.

18:35.937 --> 18:36.813
Okay,

18:36.813 --> 18:40.233
is it possible, Mrs. Winters that you didn't
know everything about your daughter?

18:40.942 --> 18:42.985
Lieutenant Caine,
do you have teenage children?

18:43.528 --> 18:44.612
No, I don't.

18:44.612 --> 18:46.698
Dara was an "A" student.

18:46.698 --> 18:48.700
She didn't smoke,
she didn't do drugs.

18:48.700 --> 18:51.244
She was going to save her
modeling money to go to college.

18:51.244 --> 18:53.371
Did you know Dara
had a P.O. Box?

18:55.164 --> 18:55.957
No.

18:55.957 --> 18:59.085
No return address. Signed by
someone named "Louise."

18:59.085 --> 19:02.380
Well, she went to grammar
school with a girl named Louise...

19:02.380 --> 19:03.423
something.

19:06.467 --> 19:08.261
She was my whole life.

19:09.095 --> 19:10.138
Mrs. Winters,

19:12.181 --> 19:14.267
we're going to find out who
did this to your daughter.

19:18.271 --> 19:19.313
Okay?

19:20.231 --> 19:21.566
Yes.

19:23.651 --> 19:27.613
Super-vee, twin-engines,
900 horsepower each.

19:27.613 --> 19:30.533
Engines on that baby cost
more than your car.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.618
Maybe more than your car.

19:32.618 --> 19:36.372
Yeah, well, our friend Willie
wasn't exactly living large.

19:46.340 --> 19:47.383
Gasoline.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.886
Yeah, and there's gas
cans under here.

19:51.637 --> 19:53.306
Yep. That's a lot of
tanks for a little boat.

19:53.306 --> 19:55.516
Obviously not for his boat.

19:55.516 --> 19:56.559
Obviously.

19:56.851 --> 19:58.061
The idiot was siphoning.

19:58.061 --> 20:01.022
Yeah, but why steal cheap
gas at a buck-thirty?

20:01.022 --> 20:02.690
He could've gone to
the corner pump.

20:02.690 --> 20:04.233
Maybe it wasn't cheap.

20:05.985 --> 20:07.028
Let's find out.

20:20.625 --> 20:25.838
Crystals we found on the barracks
floor are ordinary table salt.

20:26.255 --> 20:28.674
So somebody's guilty
of seasoning.

20:29.384 --> 20:32.720
The yellow substance found in
the air filter of the ATV...

20:32.720 --> 20:35.723
matches the  pollen found in
Dara's nasal cavity.

20:36.766 --> 20:37.850
Lignum vitae.

20:37.850 --> 20:39.435
The hardest wood in the world.

20:41.104 --> 20:43.606
The U.S. Navy almost wiped
them out during World War II...

20:43.606 --> 20:45.274
using them for propeller pins.

20:45.274 --> 20:46.943
They're very rare.

20:46.943 --> 20:50.363
The only places that they grow down here
are in Southwest Dade or in the keys.

20:50.363 --> 20:52.907
And there are none on the grounds
of Pharos Academy. I checked.

20:52.907 --> 20:57.286
So the ATV was where
Dara was killed.

20:57.286 --> 20:59.539
It's too bad it can't
tell us what happened.

20:59.831 --> 21:02.041
Maybe it can.
Hang on a second.

21:03.084 --> 21:04.127
Horatio.

21:06.170 --> 21:07.296
Okay...
thank you.

21:08.673 --> 21:10.466
Well, there you have it.

21:14.721 --> 21:16.472
blood from your
camouflaged pants ...

21:16.472 --> 21:18.599
matches a 15-year-old girl
you've never seen.

21:18.599 --> 21:19.600
Can you explain that?

21:19.600 --> 21:21.102
I already told you.

21:21.686 --> 21:24.188
I never laid eyes on
this girl before in my life.

21:24.188 --> 21:27.275
Right. But we found her
blood on your zipper.

21:27.275 --> 21:29.360
I don't know
how it got there.

21:29.610 --> 21:33.990
Look, I'm very sorry for this girl and her
family but if she was in my camp,

21:33.990 --> 21:34.866
then she was trespassing.

21:34.866 --> 21:36.325
Okay, fair enough.

21:36.325 --> 21:38.327
Then why don't we discuss
the ride that night.

21:39.037 --> 21:40.621
You got it all wrong.

21:41.539 --> 21:44.125
Last time I rode that ATV
was yesterday morning.

21:44.834 --> 21:49.005
I ran it out to the chapel then to
the latrine and back to admin.

21:52.341 --> 21:54.427
Whatever you guys are thinking,

21:55.762 --> 21:57.847
I didn't touch any of these girls.

21:59.057 --> 22:00.516
I'll take a lie-detector test ...

22:01.851 --> 22:02.727
Whatever you want.

22:02.727 --> 22:04.979
All we need is your prints
and a nasal swab.

22:05.396 --> 22:06.647
Knock yourself out.

22:13.466 --> 22:16.803
AFIS kicked back nothing on
the second set of diaphragm prints.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.096
Do you think
his might match?

22:18.096 --> 22:18.930
I don't know.

22:19.764 --> 22:23.852
No bruising, no semen ... and
anyone could've ridden this ATV.

22:23.852 --> 22:25.520
Yeah, but the blood on his zipper.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.814
I think there might
be another explanation.

22:48.543 --> 22:50.336
Are you thinking
passive transfer?

22:50.336 --> 22:51.296
For now.

22:54.966 --> 22:55.925
Hey, man.

22:56.968 --> 22:58.136
Where have you been?

22:58.136 --> 23:00.430
Waiting at DNA.

23:00.430 --> 23:03.683
They're back-logged into next week.
I got to talk to Megan about that.

23:03.683 --> 23:06.186
Well, stand in line, because I left
her three messages already.

23:06.186 --> 23:06.978
Yeah?

23:08.062 --> 23:09.063
Something's going on.

23:09.063 --> 23:11.149
Yeah. What'd you get?

23:11.149 --> 23:14.277
Willie's saliva on the
last inch of that hose.

23:14.277 --> 23:16.362
Means that it wasn't shoved
all the way down his throat.

23:16.779 --> 23:18.907
Means he was siphoning.

23:18.907 --> 23:19.949
Look at this.

23:21.326 --> 23:24.454
Gas in those tanks was
straight-up park place.

23:24.954 --> 23:29.334
High octane; 120-plus.
It's got zero alcohols or oxygenates.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.920
Yeah, it's used for, uh ...

23:31.920 --> 23:34.214
high-performance,
large bore engines.

23:34.214 --> 23:35.548
Super-vee's.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.008
He was stealing
from his neighbors.

23:37.008 --> 23:39.594
The thing about 120-plus
is that it's very dangerous.

23:39.594 --> 23:41.137
It's got a low flash point.

23:41.137 --> 23:42.514
So you're not even supposed
to store it in the sun.

23:42.514 --> 23:44.265
Yeah, you can't buy it
at the pump, either.

23:44.265 --> 23:46.184
Willie wasn't exactly
making friends.

23:46.184 --> 23:49.020
Well, you wouldn't know it
from his cell phone log.

23:49.020 --> 23:50.939
Delacroix sent over this fax.

23:50.939 --> 23:54.275
Willie's last hundred incomings;
seventy-four came from one person.

23:54.275 --> 23:55.360
Ex-wife?

23:55.360 --> 23:57.111
No, someone named motor.

24:01.157 --> 24:05.036
Willie's phone stalker is one
Timmy Diehl, A.K.A. Motor.

24:06.996 --> 24:08.706
He's a Bal Harbour Brat.

24:08.706 --> 24:10.166
Leads one of those
jet ski clubs.

24:10.458 --> 24:11.960
How'd you get
him to come down?

24:11.960 --> 24:13.336
I told him we found Willie.

24:15.213 --> 24:16.422
Where's Willie?

24:16.422 --> 24:18.007
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

24:18.007 --> 24:21.261
Hey, motor, what do you
got under there? 800 cc's?

24:21.261 --> 24:23.346
Try 1250, bored out.

24:23.346 --> 24:26.558
Wow, that's a big engine
for a little machine.

24:26.558 --> 24:28.768
It'll top-end anything
in this marina.

24:28.768 --> 24:32.063
Engine that size really begs
for the good stuff, doesn't it?

24:32.063 --> 24:35.024
You know what I'm talking about
-- gas, 120-plus.

24:35.024 --> 24:38.903
Hey, do you think you could
outrun that? It's got triple 575'S.

24:46.578 --> 24:49.581
Get me within a five-mile radius of
where the body was dumped, please.

24:50.832 --> 24:53.459
Lignum vitae is a short tree
with a heavy pollen.

24:53.459 --> 24:55.670
Fall rate's about twelve
centimeters per second.

24:55.670 --> 24:58.548
Weather service had wind out of the
southwest at three-to-four knots.

24:58.548 --> 25:00.133
With your average
eight-foot tree...

25:00.133 --> 25:03.261
you'll get a pollen footprint
of about fifty yards.

25:03.469 --> 25:06.973
So she took her last breath
within fifty yards of the pond...

25:06.973 --> 25:09.100
and just inside the
academy perimeter.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.352
It's about three miles from
where we found the body.

25:11.352 --> 25:15.315
So somebody wanted
her off property, didn't they?

25:25.783 --> 25:27.535
You see these outgoing
tracks right here?

25:27.535 --> 25:28.328
Yeah.

25:28.328 --> 25:30.580
They're deeper and
about half an inch wider.

25:30.580 --> 25:31.706
So that says to me...

25:31.706 --> 25:35.710
the ATV came in with one passenger
and probably went out with two.

25:36.419 --> 25:40.298
It also says to me that
Jane Doe was here.

25:41.716 --> 25:42.759
I've got something.

25:57.649 --> 25:58.983
Got a red halter top ...

26:02.195 --> 26:04.697
and a black miniskirt.

26:06.741 --> 26:10.495
This, ladies, is our
primary crime scene.

26:17.085 --> 26:19.420
Whoa. You picked up
a few passengers.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.005
Hey, leeches.

26:22.340 --> 26:24.133
Take a look at that, please.

26:24.133 --> 26:26.261
Yes, it's a leech.

26:26.261 --> 26:27.846
Can leave his jaw behind.

26:29.389 --> 26:32.642
Instead, let's use some
good old-fashioned saline solution.

26:32.642 --> 26:33.685
May I?

26:40.525 --> 26:41.568
Bye.

26:46.656 --> 26:48.116
Take care.
All right.

26:49.576 --> 26:50.618
So ...

26:51.870 --> 26:53.746
saline solution.

26:59.335 --> 27:00.128
Salt.

27:00.420 --> 27:01.671
You got it.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.925
Can you believe
these little piggies...

27:05.925 --> 27:09.470
will engorge themselves up to
ten times their original size?

27:14.851 --> 27:16.561
Leeches just fascinate me.

27:16.561 --> 27:19.230
Leech saliva.

27:19.230 --> 27:21.232
Medical marvel, you know.

27:21.232 --> 27:23.860
It contains enzymes that
expand your blood vessels.

27:23.860 --> 27:25.486
Kind of like viagra.

27:26.029 --> 27:27.071
Well, not quite.

27:28.072 --> 27:32.368
Unlike viagra it contains a mild
anesthetic so you don't feel the bite.

27:32.619 --> 27:34.829
Don't you hate it
when that happens?

27:34.829 --> 27:39.959
It also has plenty of hirudin.
Nature's own anticoagulant.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.920
You know, my mother
still doesn't believe me ...

27:41.920 --> 27:43.963
that they use leeches
in modern microsurgery.

27:43.963 --> 27:47.425
Yeah, well, let her lose a finger
she'll become a believer.

27:47.717 --> 27:51.971
Just slap this little mouth right
on to any reattached limb ...

27:51.971 --> 27:54.557
and watch them
do the housework.

27:54.557 --> 27:58.478
Vacuuming up all that used blood
so it doesn't cause gangrene.

27:58.478 --> 28:01.731
Which explains why there was
no bruising on Dara Winters.

28:01.731 --> 28:04.442
The leeches removed
the surface blood.

28:04.442 --> 28:08.154
The high level of anticoagulant
acted like a blood thinner,

28:08.154 --> 28:11.574
so she never clotted.
Those bites...

28:11.574 --> 28:14.827
they bled for hours after the
leeches finished feeding.

28:17.121 --> 28:18.414
It's the beer.

28:20.083 --> 28:20.959
What about the beer?

28:20.959 --> 28:24.003
The scent of beer is
like catnip for leeches.

28:24.003 --> 28:24.796
When I was little,

28:24.796 --> 28:28.424
we used to pour beer on leeches and
watch them whip into a feeding frenzy.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.261
That's why she had so
many leeches on her body.

28:31.469 --> 28:33.388
At least she never felt it.

28:34.222 --> 28:35.265
Yeah.

28:45.859 --> 28:46.985
Got a minute?

28:49.070 --> 28:52.365
So we've been going through the
letters that we found in Dara's room ...

28:52.365 --> 28:54.951
and they seem to be written
in some type of a code.

28:55.910 --> 28:58.246
It's typical for fifteen-year-old girls.

28:58.246 --> 29:01.040
Listen to this.
"Tell Q.B. No more.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.459
You have to get the
hell out of there."

29:05.879 --> 29:07.964
This girl has a secret,
doesn't she?

29:08.673 --> 29:10.800
Our leeches just
gave up their secret.

29:12.886 --> 29:14.387
You recovered the
rest of her blood?

29:14.387 --> 29:16.264
In over half the samples.

29:16.264 --> 29:19.309
And lord knows how many more are burrowed
out there, digesting. It was death by leech.

29:19.309 --> 29:20.685
It was death by leech.

29:20.685 --> 29:23.313
Well, they may
have killed her ...

29:23.313 --> 29:25.398
but they didn't move
her body, did they?

29:26.357 --> 29:29.903
Megan, it's Horatio.
Call me on my cell, will you?

29:35.366 --> 29:36.534
Sergeant Marcus?

29:36.826 --> 29:38.870
No match on pollen or prints.
He's clean.

29:38.870 --> 29:42.415
He's clean. So that means
the answer is right over here.

29:43.458 --> 29:46.044
All right, ladies, listen up.

29:46.044 --> 29:47.795
We need you all to
roll up your pant legs.

29:55.595 --> 29:58.389
Ladies, we found salt
crystals in your barracks and...

29:58.389 --> 30:01.351
we believe they were used
to remove a certain parasite.

30:01.351 --> 30:03.311
Come on, ladies, double time!

30:06.105 --> 30:07.398
You heard her, "Louise".

30:11.027 --> 30:12.403
That's your nickname, isn't it?

30:12.737 --> 30:15.448
Sir, this Cadet's name is
Julie Morales, sir!

30:18.618 --> 30:19.869
Will that be all, sir?

30:19.869 --> 30:21.162
No, ma'am, it's not.

30:21.913 --> 30:22.956
Now you.

30:24.749 --> 30:25.792
Let's go.

30:52.610 --> 30:53.653
Well, there you have it.

31:00.744 --> 31:02.829
Hey, sport, how you doing?

31:05.832 --> 31:09.377
Okay, let me help you out with this.
See that there?

31:09.836 --> 31:13.882
Now, that's 120-plus
high-performance gasoline.

31:13.882 --> 31:15.592
It's what you thought
you were buying.

31:16.092 --> 31:19.304
And this one ...

31:19.304 --> 31:22.015
is not exactly
the Ferrari of fuels, is it?

31:22.015 --> 31:25.268
And we got that from the
gas tank of your jet ski.

31:25.268 --> 31:30.482
So, Willie was cutting your 120-plus
with gas from the corner pump...

31:31.691 --> 31:33.360
and trying to sell it
to you for the real deal.

31:33.360 --> 31:37.447
That bunk locked up my engine.
It cost me three grand.

31:37.864 --> 31:38.907
Yeah...

31:39.866 --> 31:42.994
I'd be pissed.
Sounds like motive for murder.

31:46.998 --> 31:48.375
What are you talking about?

31:48.375 --> 31:50.543
Well, you know, the guy's...

31:50.543 --> 31:53.588
ripping you off and you
know he's siphoning.

31:53.588 --> 31:54.714
So, you light him up.

31:55.882 --> 31:57.801
Look, I didn't kill anybody.

31:58.218 --> 32:00.387
Phone records
got you for stalking.

32:00.887 --> 32:02.722
'Cause he was ducking me.

32:04.808 --> 32:06.309
Seventy-four calls?

32:07.352 --> 32:08.728
He never answered.

32:09.145 --> 32:11.815
But he managed to pick up
the phone the morning he died.

32:14.109 --> 32:16.945
Look. I star-67'd him.

32:16.945 --> 32:20.073
And the minute he picked up,
the phone line went dead.

32:32.002 --> 32:32.752
Horatio.

32:33.378 --> 32:35.463
Yeah?
Message for you, from Megan.

32:37.549 --> 32:38.591
Excuse me?

32:38.591 --> 32:39.843
Message from Megan.

32:43.388 --> 32:44.431
Thank you.

32:46.516 --> 32:49.602
Um ... hang on a second.
This, uh ...

32:49.602 --> 32:50.437
this can't be right.

32:50.729 --> 32:53.356
She asked that you try not
to contact her anymore.

32:59.321 --> 33:00.739
Thank you.

33:03.867 --> 33:06.077
I wanted to cut Julie a break.

33:06.077 --> 33:07.287
I was on bed check.

33:07.287 --> 33:09.581
I heard talking coming from
number two after lights out.

33:09.914 --> 33:11.541
And that's when you saw Dara?

33:11.541 --> 33:13.835
Yeah, I didn't know
who she was.

33:27.474 --> 33:30.310
The senior cadet is being
interrogated in the other room.

33:30.310 --> 33:32.479
I need you to talk to me.
Okay?

33:35.815 --> 33:37.776
I don't want to get in
any more trouble.

33:37.776 --> 33:40.612
Then you just have
to help us out, Julie.

33:40.612 --> 33:43.531
We just want to find out what happened
to Dara and why she came to you.

33:45.659 --> 33:47.243
She was my best friend.

33:49.245 --> 33:51.539
I told her she had
to leave immediately.

33:55.293 --> 33:57.754
I escorted her to the
front gate and I left her there.

33:58.380 --> 34:01.091
See, leeches need a water source.

34:01.091 --> 34:04.427
And those leech bites on your legs
indicate to me that you were at the pond.

34:04.678 --> 34:06.346
And going by your record ...

34:09.014 --> 34:11.309
and your history of violence...

34:13.603 --> 34:16.731
I think you roughed her up
and you left her there.

34:17.983 --> 34:20.068
And then you found
her dead the next morning,

34:21.485 --> 34:23.780
then you dumped her body
a few miles away ...

34:24.822 --> 34:26.908
just to cover it up.

34:37.877 --> 34:41.297
I found her by the pond at 0700
during morning rounds.

34:44.884 --> 34:47.094
I drove up and she
was just lying there.

35:12.495 --> 35:15.623
I didn't want to get in trouble for not
reporting her the night before.

35:19.336 --> 35:20.337
I'm sorry.

35:23.048 --> 35:24.716
Why did Dara cut her hair?

35:25.550 --> 35:26.676
She hated it.

35:29.679 --> 35:31.556
Hated those stupid clothes, too.

35:39.439 --> 35:41.733
Why was she running away, Julie?

35:43.276 --> 35:45.362
Did it have anything to do
with why you assaulted her mom?

35:48.239 --> 35:50.325
We talked to your parents.
They told us the whole story.

35:52.202 --> 35:54.120
They didn't tell you my story.

35:56.206 --> 35:57.457
They didn't believe me.

36:00.043 --> 36:01.503
No one ever believed me.

36:03.546 --> 36:04.589
I'll believe you ...

36:05.966 --> 36:07.008
if you tell me the truth.

36:16.184 --> 36:18.269
Dara was sick of the modeling.

36:19.729 --> 36:24.943
She was sick of everything.
Always having to be perfect.

36:25.902 --> 36:29.030
You're beautiful,
you're going to be great.

36:33.201 --> 36:35.912
But queen bitch
wouldn't let her quit.

36:36.538 --> 36:37.831
You mean her mother?

36:38.581 --> 36:40.625
She made her do a lot of things.

36:42.085 --> 36:43.128
What kind of things?

36:44.921 --> 36:48.258
No, mom, please.
Dara.

36:49.217 --> 36:50.302
No, mom ...

36:50.302 --> 36:52.304
Dara.
Please.

36:53.221 --> 36:54.889
Her mom always told her:

36:56.516 --> 36:59.227
"no choir girl ever made the A-list."

37:04.024 --> 37:07.068
So, Willie was siphoning
gas as a side gig.

37:07.068 --> 37:09.070
Which means he was
sucking in a lot of fumes.

37:10.572 --> 37:13.783
That explains his milk Jones.
He was trying to settle his stomach.

37:17.954 --> 37:21.374
Gasoline has only one use.
To ignite.

37:22.125 --> 37:23.543
So what ignited it?

37:25.295 --> 37:28.632
I don't know, maybe fillings
in his mouth caused a spark.

37:30.925 --> 37:33.011
Not according to his dental records.

37:33.011 --> 37:36.139
This guy had perfect teeth.
Maybe static electricity.

37:36.348 --> 37:37.932
A heck of a shag carpet.

37:37.932 --> 37:40.018
Maybe he had some
build-up from it.

37:44.648 --> 37:45.982
You know when you're pumping gas...

37:45.982 --> 37:47.651
you're not supposed
to get in and out of your car?

37:48.485 --> 37:50.028
Or talk on the cell phone.

37:57.535 --> 38:01.581
Lithium batteries put out
3.7 volts of electricity.

38:07.462 --> 38:08.588
What do you want?

38:13.802 --> 38:15.929
I guess he had to take
that phone call.

38:18.723 --> 38:19.808
Trip out.

38:19.808 --> 38:21.476
They say these things
can kill you.

38:33.530 --> 38:34.572
Thanks.

38:50.839 --> 38:53.466
Bet you even money
that's airborne pollen.

38:54.426 --> 38:55.468
Let's print this car.

38:56.511 --> 38:58.221
Will someone please
tell me why I'm here?

38:59.764 --> 39:00.849
They took my car.

39:01.474 --> 39:02.517
Beautiful girl.

39:06.146 --> 39:07.355
Sad eyes, though.

39:11.401 --> 39:12.652
What the hell is this?

39:12.986 --> 39:15.613
You were out there the night
Dara died, weren't you?

39:15.613 --> 39:16.823
Of course not.

39:16.823 --> 39:21.536
We found a very specific airborne
pollen on the headrest of your car...

39:21.536 --> 39:24.456
which would put you within fifty
yards of where she took her last breath.

39:25.790 --> 39:28.084
She was running
away from you, wasn't she?

39:29.127 --> 39:30.170
To Julie.

39:31.087 --> 39:32.631
She would go wherever Julie was.

39:35.967 --> 39:37.802
So you drove out there...

39:37.802 --> 39:40.472
to bring her back to bring
her back to everything...

39:40.472 --> 39:42.015
she was running away from, right?

39:48.229 --> 39:49.105
Dara?

39:50.148 --> 39:52.859
What have you done to your hair?!
Dara, you stay there!

39:52.859 --> 39:54.736
I'm not gonna do it anymore.
I won't go back!

39:54.736 --> 39:55.737
You don't have a choice.

39:55.737 --> 39:56.613
It's my life!

39:56.613 --> 39:58.239
No, life is about making sacrifices.

39:58.239 --> 40:00.200
I'm gonna tell!
I'm gonna tell everyone!

40:00.200 --> 40:01.284
Shut up!

40:03.370 --> 40:05.246
No, Dara, don't! Dara!

40:19.177 --> 40:20.428
And then you left her there.

40:20.428 --> 40:23.473
No, I was expecting her
to come home the next day.

40:25.558 --> 40:28.395
Dara was special.
She was going places.

40:28.395 --> 40:30.522
Anyone could tell.
But she was throwing it all away.

40:31.648 --> 40:33.942
And for what?
A date at the mall?

40:34.567 --> 40:36.236
High school football
on Friday nights?

40:36.236 --> 40:39.364
Some kind of average
Briar Bay existence?

40:39.364 --> 40:42.409
To three-quarters of the world
that sounds like a slice of heaven.

40:42.909 --> 40:45.745
She was running away from you
because you made her home-life hell.

40:45.745 --> 40:48.707
All I did was set up auditions.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.542
I was trying to help
her to succeed.

40:50.542 --> 40:53.753
You were forcing her to market
herself to get modeling jobs.

40:56.006 --> 40:56.756
Right?

41:00.635 --> 41:05.515
Now, we have a second
print on her diaphragm...

41:07.225 --> 41:08.268
-- your prints.

41:11.604 --> 41:15.525
We matched it to the
prints we found in your car.

41:16.568 --> 41:18.778
"No choir girl ever made the A-list."

41:19.321 --> 41:20.363
Isn't that what you told her?

41:21.281 --> 41:22.615
No, you don't understand.

41:23.658 --> 41:24.701
No, I don't.

41:25.952 --> 41:30.749
I told you that I would figure out
who did this, didn't I?

41:42.385 --> 41:43.386
Knock, knock.

41:45.805 --> 41:46.681
Come on in.

41:47.932 --> 41:49.601
Me and the guys are
going for a beer.

41:50.935 --> 41:51.978
You want to come?

41:53.563 --> 41:55.231
Mind if I take a rain check?

42:01.738 --> 42:03.031
You all right?

42:06.159 --> 42:07.494
Megan resigned.

42:10.372 --> 42:14.042
She said that work was too much
of a reminder of her husband's death.

42:15.418 --> 42:16.461
It's a shame.

42:18.713 --> 42:20.173
She was a good criminalist.

42:20.674 --> 42:21.716
She was.

42:23.677 --> 42:24.719
She was indeed.

42:29.474 --> 42:31.017
I almost walked once.

42:44.739 --> 42:46.199
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:47.325 --> 42:48.368
Yep.
