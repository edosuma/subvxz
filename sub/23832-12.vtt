WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:14.014 --> 00:16.725
- Naturally...
- To risk everything...

00:17.267 --> 00:18.685
...on a gamble.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.439
Yumeko?

00:23.148 --> 00:25.400
What you said yesterday...
are you serious?

00:27.152 --> 00:29.279
You're up against
the student council president.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.073
There's no telling
what she might make you do.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.116
Suzui?

00:33.700 --> 00:37.829
I see that you're concerned about me.
Thank you very much.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.791
But you see,
I'm very sorry, but it's no good.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.211
Such a wondrous feast
dangling before me...

00:45.295 --> 00:47.255
I can't rein myself in.

00:49.007 --> 00:54.679
I don't want to stop you. I'll watch you
gamble from the best seat in the house.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.309
Yumeko's bewitched me.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.480
Hey, you two.
How can you be so nonchalant?

01:04.105 --> 01:06.941
You think you have time to chat?
What's your game plan?

01:07.025 --> 01:10.028
What? My game plan?

01:10.111 --> 01:13.364
I mean your gamble with the president.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.917
First, dice that only lands
on the number you want.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.878
There's six to a set.
They have various applications.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.839
Next up, playing cards
featuring infrared paint.

01:30.632 --> 01:35.136
With this infrared camera,
you can see which card is which.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.306
Finally, this happens to be my favorite.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.517
So simple-looking,
but mind-blowingly effective.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.228
- It's called the Padlock Beetle--
- Wait.

01:43.311 --> 01:47.023
Don't tell me you're planning
to cheat with those things.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.651
Why are you asking
such an obvious question?

01:49.734 --> 01:51.736
Her opponent's the president, after all.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.448
If we don't at least do this much,
it's over.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.785
While I do appreciate your kindness...

01:59.369 --> 02:01.579
I have absolutely
no intention of cheating.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.623
Why not?

02:03.706 --> 02:07.085
Because for my long-awaited gamble
with the president...

02:07.961 --> 02:11.089
I have no need for impurities.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.634
I had a feeling you'd say that.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.512
If that's how it's gonna be,
let's be sure we're ready.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.306
I guess you're right.

02:20.390 --> 02:24.018
What? You're both coming with me, then?

02:24.602 --> 02:30.733
She really talked down to me. I want
to see her go down in humiliating defeat.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.444
Our money's on you, Yumeko- senpai.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.949
Suzui?

02:38.032 --> 02:39.701
Mary? Itsuki?

02:41.286 --> 02:42.579
Thank you very much.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.433
Welcome, everyone.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.894
The president is waiting.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.355
If you please.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.316
Thank you for coming.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.944
Thank you for having us, Kirari.

04:38.528 --> 04:42.615
Let's dispense with the formalities.
Let's get this show on the road, shall we?

04:43.116 --> 04:46.411
Because there's no way
I can rein myself in.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.623
Not with such a wondrous feast
dangling before me.

04:52.792 --> 04:56.170
Ever since I first met you
at this academy...

04:56.754 --> 05:00.133
or maybe even long before that...

05:00.800 --> 05:03.428
You don't know how long
I've waited for this day.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.014
Yumeko Jabami.

05:06.097 --> 05:10.143
Right! All eyes on me!

05:12.186 --> 05:17.567
I, Runa Yomozuki, am here
to serve as your referee today.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.988
You both look gung-ho.
That's what I like to see.

05:22.572 --> 05:26.534
Let me give you a quick rundown
of the rules and let's go.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.494
First, the stakes.

05:28.578 --> 05:33.041
Putting everything on the line means
you'll be betting what, specifically?

05:33.833 --> 05:37.170
Yumeko, are you enjoying life here?

05:37.253 --> 05:41.632
Yes, very much. An academy where
everything is determined by gambling.

05:42.216 --> 05:44.302
Heaven if you win, hell if you lose.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.597
Everyone living with the risk
of being reduced to groveling...

05:48.056 --> 05:51.100
You could never find a place
like this anywhere else.

05:51.809 --> 05:56.022
Hyakkao Academy is,
so to speak, my utopia.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.483
I'm so glad you like it.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.445
A flower garden isolated
from the rules of the outside world.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.908
The one absolute law is survival
of the fittest through gambling.

06:07.700 --> 06:12.413
Everyone is forced to live in desperation
at this academy, and I love it.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.543
Hyakkao Academy is an aquarium
of my own creation.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.088
That's lovely.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.341
I see that you've lavished much love
on this academy.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.634
So...

06:25.218 --> 06:26.260
Let's bet that.

06:27.261 --> 06:31.474
The one who loses this gamble
will never set foot in this school again.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.935
- Are you down with that?
- Yes.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.394
Yes.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.021
No way.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.856
- Yume--
- President!

06:38.940 --> 06:41.234
Hold on a second. Isn't that too...?

06:43.444 --> 06:44.278
Hold up.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.905
That doesn't make sense.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.532
The winner won't gain anything.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.034
So, what's the point in playing?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.619
Do you really think so?

06:51.702 --> 06:54.997
Do we gamble to win
in order to gain some advantage?

06:56.040 --> 06:58.709
That might be true
for someone competent like you.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.754
But for most people,
it's a different story.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.675
They gladly take their chances
when the odds are against them.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.887
They say that humans
are irrational beings,

07:09.971 --> 07:13.141
but you rarely see
this level of illogical behavior.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.561
Gambling produces nothing.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.772
By doing it, you only lose.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.444
And yet, we still gamble...

07:24.527 --> 07:27.405
because taking risks is so enjoyable.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.577
Runa, kindly proceed, will you?

07:32.660 --> 07:38.207
- Okey-doke. Itsuki, got any tarot cards?
- Why do you ask?

07:38.291 --> 07:42.211
We're using them for this gamble.
It's not like we don't have any here.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.339
But you'd feel more comfortable
with your own deck, right?

07:46.841 --> 07:48.801
Sure, I do have a deck.

07:48.885 --> 07:53.264
But because of what Yumeko said,
I left my trick tarot cards at home.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.349
What a frickin' waste!

07:55.433 --> 07:56.726
Thank you.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.688
Now, then, let me explain
the rules to you.

08:00.771 --> 08:04.400
For better or for worse, today's gamble...

08:04.484 --> 08:07.153
is sure to change our fate drastically.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.697
- Let's divine the future.
- Here.

08:10.323 --> 08:14.827
The name of this gamble is...
the Tarot Cards of Fate.

08:15.411 --> 08:19.207
The 22 cards of the Major Arcana,
each with different meanings.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.668
Three of us will each select one card.

08:23.794 --> 08:28.174
The cards of the Major Arcana
each bear a number from zero to 21.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.092
This will serve as the score.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.804
If it's upright from the perspective
of the one who drew it, it'll be positive.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.640
And negative if it's reversed.

08:36.432 --> 08:40.102
If the total of the three cards
ends up positive, Yumeko wins.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.563
If negative, I win.

08:43.231 --> 08:48.486
However... there's just
one special card here, the Fool.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.239
Since this card has no value,
it'll be the Joker.

08:52.281 --> 08:56.702
Regardless of the other cards,
if the Fool is upright, Yumeko wins.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.704
If it's reversed, I win.

08:58.788 --> 09:02.959
This one card will sway the outcome
of this gamble.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.670
There's always the chance
to pull off an upset.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.715
Tarot cards can divine the flow of time.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.803
The three cards
that we'll be drawing will be...

09:13.886 --> 09:15.846
the Past, the Present...

09:15.930 --> 09:17.139
and the Future.

09:18.057 --> 09:22.061
Let's divine it...
what it is we truly think.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.897
What was the purpose
of everything we've done?

09:24.981 --> 09:27.942
What kind of end will we be meeting?

09:28.025 --> 09:30.236
Let's entrust it all
to these cards of fate.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.529
Okay.

09:31.612 --> 09:35.700
Lastly, who's gonna be drawing
those three cards of fate?

09:36.284 --> 09:40.621
Let's see. Yumeko will draw the Present,
and I shall draw the Past.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.665
No way. You, draw the Past?

09:43.249 --> 09:44.333
I mean...

09:47.712 --> 09:49.839
And the last card, the Future...

09:51.757 --> 09:56.053
- You over there, what's your name?
- You mean me?

09:57.346 --> 09:59.223
I'm Ryota Suzui.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.685
All right, Ryota.
I want you to draw the Future.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.897
- Why do you want me to?
- I like that idea.

10:06.981 --> 10:10.359
- Suzui, I ask you to comply, as well.
- Yumeko.

10:10.943 --> 10:15.823
This might very well be the last gamble
I ever take part in at Hyakkao Academy.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.244
Yumeko... leave the academy?

10:20.828 --> 10:24.206
As a result of this gamble,
I may have to leave.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.709
I'd like your cooperation as well, Suzui.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.004
That big a role? I can't possibly...

10:36.093 --> 10:37.637
Wait. Just like that day...

10:39.263 --> 10:42.892
All right.
I'll be the one to draw the Future.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.687
It's settled, then.
All right, why don't we get started?

10:47.271 --> 10:49.690
With the gamble
that will decide our destiny...

10:49.774 --> 10:52.360
the Tarot Cards of Fate.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.124
All systems go.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.877
Okay, you go first, Yumeko.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.088
- Let's start with the Present.
- All right.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.512
I choose this one.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.223
- You okay with its position, too?
- Yes.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.934
All right. Card... open!

11:26.519 --> 11:28.646
Only three chances to draw.

11:28.729 --> 11:32.316
If she starts out with a huge negative,
it's gonna be hopeless.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.278
The Magician in the upright position.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.031
And your score is... plus one point.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.367
One point?

11:43.577 --> 11:47.957
For a game you're risking everything on,
that's a pretty lame start, huh?

11:48.040 --> 11:52.294
No, this is fine. Since all the cards
can be upright or reversed,

11:52.378 --> 11:56.882
the expectation value is always zero.
As long as it's positive, she has an edge.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.468
All righty, let's keep moving.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.805
Next up, President.
And you'll be choosing the Past.

12:04.849 --> 12:08.394
Yumeko, do you believe in fatalism?

12:08.477 --> 12:10.229
Do you mean fate?

12:10.312 --> 12:15.192
I'm talking about the belief
that all events are predetermined.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.156
If there were such a thing,
it would be romantic, wouldn't it?

12:20.739 --> 12:25.119
I feel the same way.
Irreproducible and unscientific.

12:25.202 --> 12:29.623
But it's also unscientific
to conclude that fate doesn't exist.

12:29.707 --> 12:33.586
Do you know the record for the number
of consecutive blacks in roulette?

12:33.669 --> 12:34.503
No.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.922
Twenty-seven times.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.342
Odds of approximately
seven billion to one.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.805
I'm sure that roulette dealer
must've thought...

12:44.889 --> 12:47.683
"Oh, this machine must be broken."

12:48.225 --> 12:49.560
Otherwise,

12:49.643 --> 12:54.356
you'd have to think that something
was making the balls land on black.

12:56.275 --> 13:00.321
Unless it's something that can't
possibly happen, it can happen.

13:01.071 --> 13:05.784
When they beat the odds by the thinnest
of margins, people see it as fate.

13:06.452 --> 13:11.123
At the end of the day, fate is merely what
comes up when something has happened,

13:11.207 --> 13:13.250
and you don't know what to call it.

13:16.253 --> 13:20.633
Yumeko, I wonder what you would call this?

13:23.093 --> 13:25.554
It's a reversed... World?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.014
The score is...

13:27.097 --> 13:29.975
Minus 21 points!

13:31.519 --> 13:35.397
That's our president.
Who knew you'd draw that one?

13:35.981 --> 13:38.025
Just how lucky are you, anyway?

13:39.944 --> 13:45.699
No way! Minus 21 points at this stage?
You've got to be cheat--

13:47.117 --> 13:51.539
Itsuki, did you even hear
what the president was saying just now?

13:51.622 --> 13:55.668
Just because you're in the hole,
you're gonna call her a cheater?

13:57.211 --> 14:00.256
Hey, no worries, okay?

14:00.923 --> 14:03.425
I'm totally neutral.

14:03.509 --> 14:08.305
I guarantee that there was no cheating
involved in the president's selection.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.268
More importantly,
the score at this time is minus 20 points.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.229
Are you ready, Ryota Suzui?

14:15.312 --> 14:19.692
At this point, the only way for Yumeko
to win is for you to draw the Fool.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.486
But you already know that, right?

14:25.239 --> 14:29.535
Suzui... the only way to win
is to draw the Fool...

14:29.618 --> 14:31.829
Isn't there any kind of clue?

14:33.789 --> 14:34.790
Hey. That's...

14:35.624 --> 14:38.168
Whoops. No good.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.671
It's Suzui who's gonna draw
the card, remember?

14:41.255 --> 14:45.593
I won't say anything, but if it looks like
you're coaching him, he's disqualified.

14:46.302 --> 14:50.055
All right, Suzui. Please draw the Future.

14:50.931 --> 14:54.476
There are twenty cards left.
Out of those twenty,

14:54.560 --> 14:58.522
I've got to draw the one and only Fool,
upright, no less.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.612
The odds are 40 to one.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.615
I just can't believe I can do it.

15:09.074 --> 15:13.203
Suzui? Please don't worry
about me and just draw.

15:13.287 --> 15:19.501
Even if we lose, I'm the one who'll
be leaving. This risk is mine alone.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.754
This pain is mine alone.

15:23.213 --> 15:26.550
All I can do is accept the results calmly.

15:28.677 --> 15:29.887
Yumeko...

15:32.097 --> 15:37.811
You're wrong. I told you, I'll be watching
from the best seat in the house.

15:38.479 --> 15:43.275
I want to spend more time with you.
This risk is just as much mine.

15:46.987 --> 15:52.201
The question is which card I'm gonna draw.
It looks like those two noticed something.

15:52.284 --> 15:56.497
- Did you hear what he just said?
- There's something I'm missing.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.375
Something. That might be a hint.

16:03.212 --> 16:08.759
Do you see it now? The remaining 20 cards
may look like there are no clues at all...

16:08.842 --> 16:11.720
but, actually, there's something sticking
to one of them.

16:14.264 --> 16:17.643
Most likely, it's gloss
or something similar.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.646
It wouldn't be there
unless it was intentional.

16:21.230 --> 16:26.110
A marked card. The kind of cheat where
you mark a card to draw one in your favor?

16:26.193 --> 16:28.070
No... and why not?

16:28.153 --> 16:32.074
Because no one but the referee,
Yomozuki, ever touched those cards.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.535
Except for that one instant...

16:34.618 --> 16:36.286
In other words, that card...

16:37.621 --> 16:38.622
The Fool.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.625
Not that Yomozuki
wasn't telling the truth.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.420
The president wasn't cheating
when she drew that card.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.173
The president marked that card,
but she didn't draw it.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.928
I have no idea why the president
would do such a thing.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.890
At any rate, the fact remains
that that card is the Fool.

16:57.474 --> 17:02.312
If he draws that one, we can win.
He can turn 40 to one odds into 20 to one.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.073
You gonna pick that card?

17:13.657 --> 17:15.200
Okay, turn it over.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.833
No. This isn't it.
This is the one card I can't draw!

17:24.293 --> 17:27.629
- What the hell are you doing?
- Whoa.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.507
One more word out of you, and...

17:31.633 --> 17:36.472
I don't know why the president placed
that mark on this card.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.433
But there's just one thing I'm sure of.

17:39.516 --> 17:44.021
Whether this card is the Fool or not,
which position I should draw it in,

17:44.104 --> 17:46.774
the risk I'm taking by drawing this card.

17:47.483 --> 17:53.322
All that... It was all provided by you,
President. Taking on risk is the fun part.

17:53.906 --> 17:58.952
Nobody would leave that most crucial task
to someone else. It's my choice to make!

18:00.204 --> 18:02.664
I'm gonna decide what risk I'm gonna take.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.961
This is my gamble!

18:09.338 --> 18:11.882
Amazing!

18:12.466 --> 18:18.639
Yes! That's splendid! Let's just pick
at random. Let's leave it all to chance.

18:19.264 --> 18:24.103
However... I insist you do it
with your own hand!

18:25.145 --> 18:27.064
Now, then...

18:27.147 --> 18:29.316
let's get our gambling freak on.

18:53.590 --> 18:58.262
Judgment in the upright position!
Plus 20 points, so a total of zero points.

18:58.345 --> 19:02.724
Therefore, the Tarot Cards of Fate
has ended in a draw.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.943
Neither one of you has to leave
the academy.

19:13.026 --> 19:16.155
- Good for you. And good job, President.
- President!

19:18.282 --> 19:19.116
President...

19:20.742 --> 19:21.869
I'm so glad.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.879
Get a hold of yourself, Sayaka.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.050
Suzui.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.261
Yumeko...

19:41.346 --> 19:45.642
What were you thinking,  senpai ?
If you'd drawn the Fool, you could've won.

19:45.726 --> 19:50.063
- Why'd you deliberately throw it away?
- Well, you know, like I said...

19:50.147 --> 19:52.399
Sumeragi, what are you talking about?

19:53.192 --> 19:57.362
A card marked so blatantly...
There's no way that was the Fool.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.991
But the Fool was the only card
the president touched.

20:01.074 --> 20:07.039
No, she must've been holding
two stuck together.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.334
If it was the Fool, there's no way
she wouldn't draw it herself.

20:10.417 --> 20:14.421
No! You just don't know, Saotome- senpai,
but the president would stoop to that.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.173
She wouldn't. Are you an idiot?

20:16.256 --> 20:19.343
- Do you want to check?
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.888
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

20:22.971 --> 20:25.515
It's more fun not to know
these kinds of things.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.684
Hey, you! Those are my tarot cards!

20:27.768 --> 20:32.689
Who knew it would end in a draw?
I think I might really become a fatalist.

20:33.273 --> 20:38.654
I think I might, too. There must be
a more thrilling fate in store for us.

20:39.696 --> 20:43.325
Yumeko, those are some fine underlings
you have there.

20:44.159 --> 20:49.539
At this rate... Oh, yes. I'm sure it will
be even more entertaining after this.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.041
No.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.502
They aren't my underlings, you know.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.965
What I've found are some amazing friends.

21:07.391 --> 21:11.061
Hey. Hello?
Did you listen to my voicemail?

21:11.144 --> 21:16.900
Things were insane over here!
Yumeko and the president's gamble...

21:18.485 --> 21:22.114
Too bad you missed it, huh?
It was so much fun.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.284
Yumeko Jabami is even more amazing
than I thought.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.246
Even the president might
not be able to handle her.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.248
You know...

21:31.331 --> 21:33.500
Ririka Momobami?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.673
Hyakkao Private Academy.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.634
Ever since Yumeko arrived here,

21:42.718 --> 21:46.263
her existence caused
an untold number of people to change.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.517
Those who rose from house pets to humans.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.479
Those who came to terms
with their yearning.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.318
Those who became mired in defeat.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.154
Those who found religion.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.325
Yumeko.

22:12.039 --> 22:12.873
And...

22:14.416 --> 22:16.877
those who lick their chops
before new prey.

22:18.211 --> 22:21.548
As of this moment,
I'm going to dissolve the student council.

22:24.634 --> 22:26.970
But Yumeko herself hasn't changed.

22:27.971 --> 22:32.350
Even after hundreds of millions, billions
of gambles, she continues to seek it out.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.104
She's not normal.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.357
A gambling freak.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.407
A compulsive gambler.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.950
THE WOMAN
WHO'S A COMPULSIVE GAMBLER
