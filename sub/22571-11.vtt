Come on, girl.
You got to slim down.

This TV ain't worth nothing.

"Fitness Involved."

05:37.004 --> 05:38.271
*

05:38.372 --> 05:39.540
What's it for,
a dog or something?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.442
Fitness?

05:41.542 --> 05:43.477
Hmm. Useless.

05:43.577 --> 05:47.381
A little
crazy-ass rollaway bed.

05:47.481 --> 05:50.017
Uh-oh, low-key tutus.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.485
*

05:51.585 --> 05:52.920
But y'all don't know,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.755
Kenny did a little
ballet in his time.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.726
*

05:58.826 --> 06:03.531
Oh, now I know why.

06:03.631 --> 06:04.832
- This here...

06:04.932 --> 06:06.333
Look like one of these
leg bender-uppers.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.769
All right, hold on.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.640
Oh, no!

06:12.740 --> 06:13.907
Gooh!

06:14.007 --> 06:15.876
Ah, I think I broke something.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.478
Now, since I know what it is,

06:17.578 --> 06:19.079
I might go
get this checked out,

06:19.179 --> 06:20.881
'cause it might be worth
a little money.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.416
This ballet starter kit

06:22.516 --> 06:24.885
might be the only treasure
I find in this here locker.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.457
Charlie Brown-ass
Christmas tree.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.659
No money.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.093
Oh, my God.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.762
What is this right here?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.597
"Vegetable steamer."

06:36.697 --> 06:40.634
Ah! Vegetables?
I don't eat no damn vegetables.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.202
I need money.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.237
This might be a good locker.
I need some money. Come on.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.372
*

06:45.473 --> 06:47.975
Da-na! More Christmas.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.278
But I probably can sell that
online, 10 bucks.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.213
Nothing.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.583
Nothing, nothing.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.218
No money.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.653
What is this?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.121
*

07:01.221 --> 07:02.590
Oh, .

07:02.690 --> 07:03.891

07:12.265 --> 07:15.402
This a fancy-ass dress.
This might be worth some money.

07:15.503 --> 07:18.238
We're gonna see
if Kenny can pas de deux it.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.673
Guess where we're going.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.308
We're going back to
dancing school.

07:21.408 --> 07:24.077
*

07:24.177 --> 07:26.346
- All right, come on.
Here we go!

07:26.446 --> 07:27.915

07:29.950 --> 07:31.752

a good room.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.121
Big hutch in the back.
He's got welding gear.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.991
That's a tile saw.
That's big bucks right there.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.027
I think it's gonna bring 1,650.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.863
- Chain saw.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.464

I love this unit.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.436
- They have a couple thousand
bucks worth of stuff in there.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.438
- Easy stuff to sell.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.541
- Helium thingies.
Big refrigerator.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.143
There could possibly be
some refurb supplies in here,

07:56.243 --> 07:57.611
but I don't need supplies.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.380
I need actual things that
I can make something out of.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.550
- This a moneymaking unit
right here.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.384
All these tools can be resold.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.620
Scaffold.
I'd get rid of it...

08:06.720 --> 08:08.155
Like that.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.489
- So you go 50 bucks
on this, right?

08:09.590 --> 08:10.524
- Yeah.

1,000 now.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.207
I got $1,000.
- Make sure he sees you.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.009
- 1,100 to you.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.444
1,100 where, 1,100 there.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.446
1,300 now.
1,300.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.982
1,300.
1,400.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.317
1,400. 1,400. 1,500 now.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.952
- 1,500, 1,550.
Shaking his head no.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.888
1,500 going once,
1,550 going twice...

08:40.988 --> 08:44.257
1,500

08:44.357 --> 08:46.627
Sold it your way,
1,500, Jarrod, Brandi!

08:46.727 --> 08:49.362
Jarrod and Brandi bought it
at 1,500. Lock it up!

08:49.462 --> 08:50.598
- This is a good unit.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.399
*

08:52.499 --> 08:54.001
Wish we would've
got it for 1,200.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.670
- Well, if wishes were fishes,
I'd be the king of the sea.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.338
- You would be the queen
of the sea, Brandi.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.240
- Whatever.
- Women cannot be the king.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.541
- I can be anything
I want to be.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.644
- You don't have
the right parts.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.245
- Nothing in your
price range, huh?

09:05.345 --> 09:08.181
- Nope. I'm not money bags,
like these other guys.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.051
- Ha!

09:11.151 --> 09:12.519
- All right, here we go!

09:12.620 --> 09:15.689
10 by 15, baby!

09:15.789 --> 09:17.658
*

09:17.758 --> 09:19.693
- Got a really nice smoker...
- Got some chairs.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.161
- Got some chairs.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.963
Got some oak barstools.
- The chairs look beat up.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.532
- I see my favorite
kitchen appliance.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.034
What's that?

09:27.134 --> 09:28.736
- The microwave oven.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.303
- Look at that thing, Kenny.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.439
Freakin' barbecue
all day, every day.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.774
- Yeah.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.243
- First thing
that I want to talk about.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.712
- I really want a smoker.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.513
- But that's a barbecue
and a smoker,

09:40.614 --> 09:42.883
and we already have a barbecue.
- I know.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.317
- But I don't see a lot
of expensive stuff in this--

09:44.417 --> 09:46.086
- I don't see anything else.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.755
- All right, if you're
ready to go, I'm ready to go.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.489
And here we go, how much money?
A little smoker unit.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.058
Start 'em in. I got $50.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.694
75 where? I got 50 bucks.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.063
75 where? 50 bucks.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.899
50 bucks. What about 60 bucks?
What about 70 bucks?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.868
I got 60, 70, 70, 70--
- Dan...

10:00.968 --> 10:03.203
I'm not waving hello over here.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.873
70 bucks,
70 bucks, 80 bucks, 80 bucks.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.474
I got 70. Are you 80, girl?
- Yeah.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.909
What do you think this means?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.477
- 80, 90--
What? I got 80.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.180
What about 90?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.982
110.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.950
130, 120, 130, 130.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.787
--140.
150, 140, 150, 160.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.022
--
200 bucks, 225.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.891
225.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.859
275. I got 250.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.328
What about 300, 325?

10:28.428 --> 10:30.330
350 and 75. What about 400?

10:30.430 --> 10:31.999
What about 400

10:32.099 --> 10:34.101
What about 500

10:34.201 --> 10:35.736
What about 550?
How about 525? 25.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.637
Come on, there, what about 525?
And you're out.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.106
I got 500.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.308
525 going once,
525 going twice,

10:41.408 --> 10:43.110
last and final call.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.278
Sold it your way, $500, Darrel!
Lock it up!

10:45.378 --> 10:49.282
- Dan sure didn't miss
my $500 bid, did he?

10:49.382 --> 10:51.084
500 bucks.
- That's the end of the sale.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.786
And don't forget
to pay the lady.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.254
God bless you, folks!

10:54.354 --> 10:55.689
I noticed you didn't
buy anything today.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.157
There was, like, nothing

10:57.257 --> 10:59.226
that I was looking for,
really, so...

10:59.326 --> 11:02.262
- You know, I've got some cool
eclectic stuff in storage

11:02.362 --> 11:03.630
that I think that you could
turn it into a masterpiece.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.366
Today wasn't
a total waste after all.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.736
Maybe I can find
my Zen with Laura.

11:08.836 --> 11:13.240
Perfect!

11:13.340 --> 11:14.474
*

11:17.177 --> 11:19.279
- There's a lot of big stuff
to get out of this unit,

11:19.379 --> 11:20.914
so I've assembled
the dream team.

11:21.014 --> 11:21.982
- Oh...

11:22.082 --> 11:24.117
- Bozek!

11:24.217 --> 11:25.618
- Bozek's back.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.220
What's up?
- Hey.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.722
- Just working, working.
How's it going?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.523
- Good.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.692
- We got a lot, man.
It's just like the old days.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.595
- Ha!
- Lot of dirty stuff.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.697
- Straight to the dump.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.132
- Nope.
- Okay.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.633
- No, good stuff.
- Whoo.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.135
Let's just get it over here.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.271
Right there looks good.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.273
- J, these are listed
for 1,000 bucks--

11:46.373 --> 11:47.975
the brick saw.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.309
- That thing's money.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.411
- 260 for this chainsaw.
- Yep.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.412
Paint sprayer?
- Mm-hm.

11:52.512 --> 11:53.713
- 800 bucks on this,

11:53.814 --> 11:55.648
'cause it's not
in great condition.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.717
- That's a good Dewalt
table saw right there.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.519
- So money.
Talk to me, Goose.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.321
- 200 bucks
for the Dewalt table saw.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.890
- Nice.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.492
- 200 bucks
for the impact wrench.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.627
- Yeah.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.262
- 250 for the snake, J.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.697
- There you go.
Oh, look at that.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.299
- Whoo!
- That's a roller right there.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.633
- That's a good table saw
right there.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.368
- It's like money in the bank.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.504
- 419.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.973
- Yeah, so I'm gonna say 280.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.074
- Damn, look at that.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.143
Thing's bad to the bone.
- Whoa.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.145
- I never seen
a socket wrench that size.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.313
- That's what she said.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.747
- I don't know
if she said that.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.749
- She did not say that.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.418
- 100 bucks for the wrench.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.220
- Probably a couple hundred
bucks right here.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.754
- At least, yeah, definitely.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.857
- That scaffold thing
looks like there's two sets.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.558
Probably 1,500.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.161
- One, two, three, four...

12:41.261 --> 12:43.063
- Babe, we got
five boxes of speakers.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.764
- These are cheap, J.

12:44.865 --> 12:48.135
Like a no-name off brand,
so they're, like, 30 bucks.

12:48.235 --> 12:51.138
- Let's call it 25.
We'll call it 125 bucks.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.841
All this wire, all this copper,
those tanks--

12:53.941 --> 12:55.508
there's probably, easy,
another 300 bucks in here.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.210
We probably made 5 grand.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.578
- I knew it.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.713
- We caught them sleeping.
- I knew it.

13:00.814 --> 13:01.982
- Bozek, you want
some speakers?

13:02.082 --> 13:03.283
'Cause I can't
pay you for today.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.485
- Gently used!

13:08.455 --> 13:09.589
*

13:09.689 --> 13:11.558
- Oh! There it is.

13:11.658 --> 13:12.960
I brought Zoe with me today

13:13.060 --> 13:14.694
to help me
go through the locker.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.164
She can help me lift things
and do the math.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.067
First thing I want to do
is roll this barbecue out.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.768
This has got a grill on it.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.403
It's got a smoker.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.306
I'll get 250, 300, no problem.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.640
See this little baking dish
right here?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.276
- Yeah.
- This is Le Creuset.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.679
- Oh.
- This is about 80, $90.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.849
There's that same stuff again.
That's Le Creuset.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.051
Gramps will get
about 60 bucks for this.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.252
- That's cool.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.587
- Well, you're a lot
more willing to help

13:40.687 --> 13:41.788
than your uncle Brando.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.423
- Look at you.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.060
Coffee grinders and silverware,
all that kind of stuff.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.828
20 bucks.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.298
Gosh, this little pine trunk's
kind of old.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.868
That thing's worth 40 bucks
by itself right there.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.569
Wine racks, 50 bucks.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.005
These are J.R. Henckels.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.839
These are very, very
expensive knives.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.742
There's about 50 bucks
worth of knives right here.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.812
Holy mackerel, look at this.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.014
Hey, Zoe!

14:07.114 --> 14:08.448
- Look at all these Legos.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.917
Do you know anything
about Legos?

14:10.017 --> 14:11.118
- No.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.320
- That could be worth
a few hundred bucks.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.022
More Le Creuset.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.356
This is another 30 bucks
in frying pans.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.757
- Okay.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.627
- This is one of those
car-canopy things right here.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.562
See, it's got the windows
and all that.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.397
This is 150 bucks.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.799
Oh, two more Le Creuset.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.536
I get 60 on the big one,
and 40 on the little one.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.472
Chopping block.
That, Zoe, right there...

14:32.572 --> 14:34.641
is 75 bucks.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.544
That's a mission oak table.
That's 35 bucks.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.280
And this is a complete set.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.215
I'll get 50 bucks apiece
on these chairs,

14:42.315 --> 14:43.550
and how many is there?

14:43.650 --> 14:45.185
- Four, so 200.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.354
- You're better than
your uncle Brando!

14:47.454 --> 14:48.521
*

14:48.621 --> 14:50.023
Let me get over here.

14:50.123 --> 14:53.326
Just a bunch of more
dirty, dusty stuff.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.727
What the heck?

14:54.827 --> 14:55.963
*

14:56.063 --> 14:57.497
What is all this stuff?

14:57.597 --> 14:58.798
*

14:58.898 --> 15:00.700
Oh, wow.
- Wow.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.137
Oh, my God.
- Skeleton stuff.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.939
These are bizarre.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.308
Look at this.
This is a snake, probably.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.577
- That's definitely a snake.
- You know your reptiles.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.911
That I know.
- Yes, I do.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.981
- No.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.615
- Oh, that creeps me out.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.450
That's a bird.
- That's a bird.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.585
You can tell
by the beak right--

15:18.685 --> 15:20.253
- Ah!
Would that be fun

15:20.353 --> 15:21.888
for me and you to go
get this stuff checked out?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.323
- Very fun.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.093
- Zoe loves animals,
and Grandpa loves money.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.128
This is a perfect find.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.430
Look at the tail
and everything.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.698
Ah!

15:33.666 --> 15:35.368
*

15:35.468 --> 15:36.869
- Hey, Dan.
- Hey, Mary.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.972
Laura said you're coming by.
She's out in the clay house.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.640
- Yeah. Cool.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.342
I'm at the Dotson's because
Laura said she needs help

15:42.442 --> 15:44.978
with her "clay house,"
whatever that means.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.480
- Mary! Oh!
- Look at this place.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.216
- Good to see you.
- So cool.

15:50.717 --> 15:51.951
- Oh, my gosh,
this place is awesome.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.354
I am getting a little artsy...

15:54.454 --> 15:55.455
- Yes.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.157
And I want you
to make me something.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.791
- Fun.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.927
This is just like
regular old wood,

16:01.028 --> 16:02.795
but I know how you can
turn things into stuff...

16:02.895 --> 16:04.197
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- And pull it apart.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.398
- I can make something
out of this.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.399
- You know,
and, like, reclaim it.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.500
And there's grooves in here.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.835
- For sure.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.270
- I got a few ideas.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.439
This is exactly what I've
been looking to do lately.

16:12.539 --> 16:16.976
Trash to treasures.

16:17.077 --> 16:17.977
- This place is
really super cool.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.012
Hi.
- Hello.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.580
- Yes.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.948
- Zoe and I found a place
called The Bone Room,

16:22.049 --> 16:24.117
and it's exactly
what it sounds like,

16:24.217 --> 16:25.952
a room with a lot of bones.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.821
- Whoa.
Look at the alligator.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.490
- Mm-hmm, good catch.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.526
- So anyways, this is the stuff
that I called you about.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.995
- Ooh, this guy is a bat.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.297
You know what's cool
about bats?

16:37.397 --> 16:39.899
- The wings are their hands.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.734
- Oh, wow.
- These are the fingers

16:41.834 --> 16:44.137
that have been elongated
and turned into wings.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.638
- Oh, wow.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.907
This looks like a bird.
- Mm-hmm, definitely a bird.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.309
You can tell by the beak.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.278
- I'll bet that's
a peregrine falcon.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.912
- Um...
- It looks like a crow.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.882
- No, no, no, that's a falcon.
Look at the size of the beak.

16:55.982 --> 16:59.619
- You know, I kind of think
that Zoe is probably right.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.021
And this, I think--
it's a squirrel.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.723
- How can you tell
it's a squirrel?

17:03.823 --> 17:05.258
- Well, it's a rodent,

17:05.358 --> 17:07.960
and you can tell it's a rodent
because of the skull.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.862
You see the orange incisors.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.632
Rodents always have yellow
or orange incisors.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.768
- Oh, wow.
- It's a little morbid to me.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.404
- Oh, well...

17:17.504 --> 17:19.706
- The snake--
that smells really bad.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.641
- Mm-hmm.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.311
- Hmm. Well, it does
smell a little bit.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.978
It wasn't perfectly
prepped, I think.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.714
I think this was a home job.

17:27.814 --> 17:31.251
Ideally, you have this
in a controlled situation,

17:31.351 --> 17:34.454
with beetles eating
the flesh off,

17:34.554 --> 17:35.722
and then you get it out

17:35.822 --> 17:37.857
before they get through
the connective tissue.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.859
- Beetles eating the flesh off.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.027
- It's interesting.
- Yeah.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.495
- Zoe's a braver girl than me.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.997
I kind of want to puke.

17:45.098 --> 17:48.268
So, Diana, can you tell me
what is this worth?

17:48.368 --> 17:49.736
- Uh...

17:49.836 --> 17:52.705
I kind of am suspecting,
looking at them,

17:52.805 --> 17:53.840
uh, that...

17:53.940 --> 17:55.442
*

17:55.542 --> 17:58.611
Um, this is actually
illegal to sell.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.013
*

18:02.515 --> 18:05.918
- Yeah, you're not supposed
to sell roadkill.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.421
Because you like these bones,

18:08.521 --> 18:10.423
I think I'll just
let you keep 'em.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.691
- Cool.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.994
is heavy.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.230
No wonder the ballet dancers
have muscles.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.733
I'm here to see a ballerina
about my ballet gear.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.136
Are you Natasha?
- I'm Natasha.

18:23.236 --> 18:26.273
- Maybe five, six, seven, eight
down memory lane.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.741
So how long have you been doing
this ballet dancing?

18:28.841 --> 18:31.278
- I grew up in this business,
three generations.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.713
If I tell you how long, then
I'm gonna give away my age,

18:33.813 --> 18:34.714
and we don't want to do that.

18:34.814 --> 18:35.815
- You're looking 30, girl.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.417
- Hey, okay,
I'll settle for that.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.652
- I got this stuff right here
I need you to look at.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.120
- Yeah, let me see.

18:41.221 --> 18:45.091
So you've got a bunch of
little tutus going on here.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.927
This is definitely
pre-teen or teenager.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.429
It's very well made.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.565
Has the arm puffs.
They are worn up here.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.235
What's nice about this is
that it has nice beading.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.170
There was some effort
put into this.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.773
- Low-key professional,
right, exactly.

19:00.873 --> 19:05.111
- Can you give me, like,
a price on this tutu?

19:05.212 --> 19:08.981
- Well, I'd say
this dress would be worth...

19:09.081 --> 19:10.617
*

19:10.717 --> 19:12.885
At least $250.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.421
- Mm-hmm.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.289
- So what's up
with the ballet bar?

19:16.389 --> 19:18.191
- This is a fluidity bar.

19:18.291 --> 19:22.962
It's used for yoga,
ballet barre Pilates.

19:23.062 --> 19:25.365
You put your palm like this...
- Mm-hmm.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.900
- And you're working
your upper body.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.769
- So that's how y'all get
them muscles, huh, girl?

19:29.869 --> 19:31.704
- That's right.

19:31.804 --> 19:35.141
- So give me
a price check on...

19:35.242 --> 19:37.277
this here pole right here.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.579
- A good estimate for this,

19:39.679 --> 19:42.148
being used, would be about...

19:42.249 --> 19:43.916
*

19:44.016 --> 19:45.952
125.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.520
125 used?
- Yes.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.756
- All right,
that's about three positions.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.325
Now let's see
if I still got it.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.494
- Plié one.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.363
Turn out those toes.
Straight back.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.465
Stretch this leg.
- Oh, yeah.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.899
- Hold it, hold, hold,
hold, hold, hold,

19:59.999 --> 20:01.734
hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.303
Stretch that knee.
- Yeah!

20:03.403 --> 20:05.572
- Hold your back tall.
Tall, tall. Show me.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.607
I thought we had
more training than that.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.609
It was years ago!

20:09.709 --> 20:12.178
announcer: Jarrod and Brandi
didn't tool around,

20:12.279 --> 20:15.882
making a hefty pay day
of 3,700 bucks.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.585
Darrell's granddaughter Zoe
brought him good luck

20:18.685 --> 20:21.254
and a profit of 900 bones.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.556
Prima ballerina
Kenny Crossley

20:23.656 --> 20:26.659
raised the bar to almost $300.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.328
And Mary Padian...

20:30.062 --> 20:33.065
announcer: Did she ever find
her Zen with Laura?

20:33.165 --> 20:35.001
- Hey, Mary, I couldn't wait!
- Hey.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.504
- Here it is.
I love this!

20:37.604 --> 20:39.005
This was pallets?
- Yeah.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.140
I cut 'em in half,
and then did 45-degree angles.

20:42.542 --> 20:43.710
- What's all the clucking
going on in here?

20:43.810 --> 20:45.412
- Oh, my God!

20:45.512 --> 20:47.547
- This was the old pallet.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.682
- Pay the lady.
- Yeah, pay me now.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.887
- 200 bucks, Dan, 200 bucks.
I don't have 200 bucks.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.624
- Even less now!

20:57.724 --> 20:59.292
- Just buy it. Hurry up.
