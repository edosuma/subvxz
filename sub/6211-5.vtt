WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:03.134
This is going to be

00:03.202 --> 00:04.869
the best community
charity drive ever.

00:04.937 --> 00:06.671
Yeah. Every business
on Water Street

00:06.739 --> 00:08.138
working together
to help the victims

00:08.207 --> 00:09.941
devastated
by the hurricane
in Honduras.

00:10.009 --> 00:12.544
And all the other businesses
are going to be devastated

00:12.612 --> 00:14.278
by the success of our bake sale.

00:14.346 --> 00:16.180
Yep, that's what charity's
all about-- winning.

00:16.248 --> 00:16.781
Mm-hmm.

00:16.849 --> 00:18.517
Oh, look at my cuticles.

00:18.584 --> 00:19.684
Not that they matter

00:19.752 --> 00:21.553
compared to the plight
of the Hondurans.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.022
SALEM:
An armadillo? A goldfish?
How about an iguana?

00:24.090 --> 00:26.357
Things that taste better
deep fried?

00:26.425 --> 00:29.394
No, Salem is badgering me
to let him get a pet.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.729
A pet for Salem?

00:30.796 --> 00:32.664
But he's childish,
irresponsible,

00:32.732 --> 00:33.965
scatterbrained...

00:34.033 --> 00:35.433
Mm-hmm.
By the way,

00:35.500 --> 00:37.535
I found your keys
in the front door.

00:37.637 --> 00:38.570
And the notebook you lost

00:38.704 --> 00:40.104
in the dryer.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.873
But I don't want a pet.

00:43.008 --> 00:43.975
Oh!

00:45.244 --> 00:48.179
Cool! My first credit
card... and no bills

00:48.181 --> 00:49.848
and a lot of catalogs.

00:49.916 --> 00:53.284
I have been specially chosen
for unbridled consumption.

00:53.352 --> 00:54.753
And it makes a really cool noise
when you swipe it.

00:54.821 --> 00:55.887
Uh...

00:55.922 --> 00:56.821
Sabrina,

00:56.889 --> 00:57.889
I have to warn you.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.724
If you get anything
and everything you want,

00:59.792 --> 01:01.526
you'll never learn
to appreciate the things

01:01.594 --> 01:02.993
that are really
important in life.

01:03.061 --> 01:04.162
SALEM:
Exactly.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.730
That's why I think
you should use it

01:05.865 --> 01:06.897
to get <i>me</i> a pet.

01:06.965 --> 01:08.133
I'll take a llama.

01:08.201 --> 01:09.801
I'm going to be very responsible
with this card

01:09.869 --> 01:11.369
and a pet is not
something you need.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.437
However...

01:16.008 --> 01:18.143
this is a necessity.

01:19.111 --> 01:20.345
I'm not enjoying this.

01:56.415 --> 01:58.483
Oh, this new sweater
looks even better on

01:58.551 --> 02:00.485
than it did
in the Other Realm catalog.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.821
Sabrina, I'm serious
about this credit card.

02:02.888 --> 02:04.288
Be careful.

02:04.356 --> 02:06.657
Witches are very susceptible
to "get-itis."

02:06.725 --> 02:08.059
"Get-itis"?
Oh, you mean

02:08.127 --> 02:10.094
what mortal children get
on Christmas morning?

02:10.162 --> 02:11.429
Exactly.

02:11.497 --> 02:13.732
You don't appreciate anything
because you keep thinking

02:13.799 --> 02:15.533
each new item will
bring you happiness.

02:15.601 --> 02:16.901
Okay, well, this isn't
my first time

02:16.968 --> 02:18.169
at the cauldron, you know.

02:18.236 --> 02:19.938
I got a sweater
because it's sweater weather

02:20.005 --> 02:22.440
and that doesn't mean it can't
be stylish sweater weather.

02:22.508 --> 02:24.275
Okay...
I hope they give you

02:24.343 --> 02:27.445
frequent flyer miles
for rationalizations.

02:29.048 --> 02:31.682
You know, sometimes I think
she has no faith in me.

02:31.750 --> 02:34.084
But I totally appreciate
this new sweater...

02:36.021 --> 02:39.257
and the fact that it comes
in 37 festive fall colors.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.959
And she said this
wouldn't make me happy.

02:42.027 --> 02:44.796
Although I'd be a lot happier
if I had shoes to match.

02:44.863 --> 02:46.864
I look so cute, but...

02:46.932 --> 02:48.700
now I need a horse.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.368
Oh, advertisers'll do anything

02:50.436 --> 02:52.036
to catch
the elusive teen market.

02:53.505 --> 02:55.907
"Can't you hear me
crying in the attic? Salem."

02:55.975 --> 02:57.642
(Salem sobbing)

02:57.710 --> 02:59.343
Ah, there it is.

02:59.411 --> 03:01.646
SALEM:
Come comfort me.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.181
I'm busy.

03:03.215 --> 03:06.484
SALEM: Then I guess
I'll just have to dry my tears

03:06.552 --> 03:09.454
on this stack
of brand-new catalogs!

03:11.190 --> 03:12.390
Give me!

03:12.457 --> 03:13.491
Made you run!

03:13.526 --> 03:15.226
Salem, what are you doing
up here?

03:15.294 --> 03:16.727
Playing the pity card.

03:16.795 --> 03:17.996
I want a pet.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.497
I want something to play with,

03:19.565 --> 03:21.332
something to give <i>me</i>
unconditional love

03:21.400 --> 03:23.434
the way I do for you.

03:23.502 --> 03:24.936
Oh, so you were thinking
of something

03:25.004 --> 03:26.170
in the disease family?

03:26.238 --> 03:29.307
Oh! Hey, my old jewelry box.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.542
Look! The charm bracelet
my grandma gave me.

03:31.610 --> 03:32.810
I was afraid I'd lost it.

03:32.878 --> 03:34.011
Touching.

03:34.079 --> 03:35.880
And it's going
to get me a pet how?

03:35.948 --> 03:37.581
Salem, everything I know
about manipulation

03:37.649 --> 03:38.616
I learned from you.

03:38.684 --> 03:39.617
You're sweet.

03:39.684 --> 03:41.252
What's your point?

03:41.320 --> 03:43.054
Stop asking Aunt Zelda
for a pet.

03:43.122 --> 03:45.422
Move on to Miss Pushover--
Aunt Hilda.

03:45.490 --> 03:47.791
And the student
becomes the teacher.

03:47.859 --> 03:50.061
The circle of life is complete.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.529
Be careful, Sabrina.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.431
Don't do that, Sabrina.

03:53.499 --> 03:56.567
Why am I always the one
who has to say no?

03:56.635 --> 03:57.869
You're the mean one?

03:59.338 --> 04:00.338
You're right.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.806
I'll handle the next problem
that arises.

04:01.874 --> 04:02.706
Thank you.

04:02.774 --> 04:04.775
Look who I found
all alone in the attic.

04:04.843 --> 04:06.310
Now that reminds me.

04:06.378 --> 04:07.945
One of these days,
we really have
to get up there

04:08.013 --> 04:09.581
and clean out all
that useless old junk.

04:09.648 --> 04:11.249
I'm right here.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.083
And, look, I found
my old charm bracelet.

04:13.151 --> 04:15.319
Sabrina,
it's beautiful.

04:15.387 --> 04:16.853
And I'm sure you
appreciate it even more

04:16.956 --> 04:18.255
because you didn't
just zap it in

04:18.322 --> 04:19.523
with your new credit card.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.326
Can I have a pet?

04:23.362 --> 04:24.462
No.

04:25.531 --> 04:26.564
Please?

04:26.632 --> 04:27.866
Oh, okay.

04:27.866 --> 04:28.867
Hilda!

04:28.934 --> 04:30.067
Oh, lighten up.

04:30.135 --> 04:31.569
Who cares
if Salem gets a pet?

04:31.637 --> 04:34.706
So what if Sabrina
zaps in a couple of things
from the Other Realm?

04:34.773 --> 04:36.140
It's not the end
of the world.

04:36.208 --> 04:37.274
Thank you, Aunt Hilda.

04:37.342 --> 04:38.843
Want to ride
on my new Vespa?

04:38.911 --> 04:39.977
You don't have
a Vespa.

04:41.112 --> 04:42.279
Do now.

04:43.515 --> 04:45.115
It's still not
the end of the world.

04:45.183 --> 04:47.619
So, do you think
I can do wheelies
on my new Vespa?

04:47.653 --> 04:49.720
Maybe I'll get
a wild boar.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.857
I always thought
the end of the world

04:52.925 --> 04:54.158
would involve more locusts.

04:54.226 --> 04:56.160
And we'll be holding
our rummage sale

04:56.228 --> 04:58.930
at that cute little coffee place
on Water Street.

04:58.998 --> 05:01.265
So, if there are
no further questions...

05:01.333 --> 05:03.100
let's get it on!

05:04.102 --> 05:05.103
(bell rings)

05:05.171 --> 05:07.305
And, uh... read chapter 11.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.439
That's cute.

05:08.507 --> 05:09.774
That's what I need--
a day planner.

05:11.309 --> 05:12.743
Ha!

05:12.811 --> 05:13.711
Great.

05:13.779 --> 05:15.780
Okay, now all I need
is some plans.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.149
Um... oh, buy more stuff.

05:18.216 --> 05:19.984
Sabrina, I know
I don't need to ask,

05:20.051 --> 05:21.686
but would you
be my assistant

05:21.754 --> 05:22.887
at the rummage sale?

05:22.955 --> 05:24.389
Sure.

05:24.456 --> 05:26.691
"Buy rummage sale outfit."

05:26.758 --> 05:29.360
Oh, what a lovely
charm bracelet.

05:29.428 --> 05:30.661
Oh, isn't it great?

05:30.729 --> 05:31.996
My grandma
gave it to me.

05:33.265 --> 05:34.465
Oh, a Palm Pilot.

05:34.533 --> 05:36.600
That's much better than
my stupid day planner.

05:36.668 --> 05:38.936
I had a charm bracelet
when I was a little girl.

05:39.004 --> 05:41.305
Every time my father
went away on a business trip,

05:41.373 --> 05:42.573
he brought me a new charm.

05:42.641 --> 05:46.310
Mother used to call it
my little guilt bracelet.

05:46.378 --> 05:47.478
Hey!

05:47.545 --> 05:50.314
I've been saving
to buy this for 20 years.

05:50.382 --> 05:51.616
This is a fine example

05:51.683 --> 05:53.418
of what hard work
can bring you.

05:53.485 --> 05:54.385
A gold brick?

05:54.452 --> 05:55.620
Yes.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.689
You didn't buy that
from gypsies, did you?

05:57.756 --> 05:59.657
I probably would have
squandered my savings

05:59.725 --> 06:01.525
on securities
and internet start-ups.

06:01.593 --> 06:04.329
Well, you will lose
that mocking tone soon enough

06:04.396 --> 06:07.398
when you try to buy
a loaf of bread with paper money

06:07.466 --> 06:09.333
after the world
economy collapses

06:09.401 --> 06:11.035
or we're invaded by aliens.

06:11.103 --> 06:12.470
Aliens?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.872
Now you get an idea
of the caliber
of conversation

06:14.940 --> 06:16.941
in the teachers' lounge.

06:18.009 --> 06:19.977
Any luck at the
Other Realm pound?

06:20.045 --> 06:20.911
Define luck.

06:20.979 --> 06:22.813
Lavender.

06:22.881 --> 06:24.649
Frosting.

06:24.716 --> 06:25.649
Toast.

06:25.717 --> 06:26.784
Ginger.

06:26.851 --> 06:28.519
You let him get a dogman?

06:28.587 --> 06:29.887
What's that?

06:29.955 --> 06:30.821
Huh?

06:32.024 --> 06:35.359
His name's Sparky.

06:35.427 --> 06:37.461
It's still warm.

06:37.529 --> 06:41.265
I'm afraid we've got
a full-blown case of get-itis.

06:41.333 --> 06:45.836
I don't care
if it's on back order.

06:45.904 --> 06:46.937
Oh, morning.

06:47.005 --> 06:48.472
Well, there
just aren't

06:48.540 --> 06:50.974
enough hours in
the day, are there?

06:51.042 --> 06:52.443
Sabrina, you've got a problem.

06:52.510 --> 06:54.312
Yeah, you're keeping me
from getting more stuff.

06:54.379 --> 06:56.114
Mrs. Quick called.
You were supposed to be

06:56.181 --> 06:57.815
at the rummage sale
a half hour ago.

06:57.882 --> 06:59.016
Oh, I completely forgot

06:59.118 --> 07:00.518
and I'm supposed to bring
stuff to donate.

07:00.585 --> 07:02.319
Wherever will
you find something?

07:02.387 --> 07:04.956
Oh, not my stuff.
I love my stuff.

07:05.023 --> 07:07.559
You're on the verge
of becoming spoiled rotten.

07:07.626 --> 07:09.326
All right,
quit lobbing the guilt bombs.

07:09.394 --> 07:11.629
I'll donate some of my stuff
to the Hondurans.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.298
Good girl. You'll feel
a lot better when you do.

07:14.366 --> 07:16.934
Do you remember
how we got through?

07:17.001 --> 07:19.770
Uh... oh, left
at the frozen steaks.

07:21.807 --> 07:24.074
Well, I guess
I don't need the sled.

07:24.142 --> 07:26.544
Oh, what if it snows next week?

07:26.611 --> 07:30.381
Well, I can always donate
these ballet slippers.

07:30.449 --> 07:33.317
Although, I have been intrigued
by the world of dance.

07:33.385 --> 07:36.220
You know, I don't see my aunts
giving away any of their stuff.

07:39.058 --> 07:43.727
They said they wanted someone
to clean up this old junk.

07:43.795 --> 07:44.796
Spoiled? Ha!

07:44.863 --> 07:46.196
I'm selfless.

07:53.038 --> 07:54.472
Sabrina, I was
getting worried,

07:54.540 --> 07:55.606
but look at all

07:55.674 --> 07:58.008
this wonderful
stuff you brought.

07:58.076 --> 08:00.110
An Olympic gold medal?

08:00.178 --> 08:02.046
Are you sure you
want to donate this?

08:02.113 --> 08:03.247
Oh, that old thing? Sure.

08:03.315 --> 08:04.615
I can always get more.

08:04.683 --> 08:07.785
Maybe some medals
would cheer me up.

08:07.853 --> 08:10.254
And the gold medal in
synchronized swimming goes to...

08:10.321 --> 08:12.322
Mrs. Quick.

08:12.390 --> 08:14.458
What's everybody
standing around for?

08:14.526 --> 08:16.194
We got to raise more money

08:16.262 --> 08:18.529
than any other store
on this street.

08:18.597 --> 08:20.397
We're going to be number one!

08:20.465 --> 08:22.400
Hey, hey, hey,
this isn't a reading room.

08:22.467 --> 08:23.467
Buy it or get out.

08:23.535 --> 08:27.238
Sit. Come on,
Sparky, sit.

08:27.306 --> 08:28.138
I know this.

08:29.474 --> 08:30.541
No.

08:30.609 --> 08:32.842
Okay, shake hands.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.779
I got this one.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.780
No. Close.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.081
How about beg?

08:37.148 --> 08:38.816
Oh! Oh!

08:40.753 --> 08:45.656
Okay, so using you as my driver
is not going to work.

08:45.724 --> 08:47.291
That's it?

08:47.359 --> 08:48.593
Two muffins
and a scone?

08:48.660 --> 08:50.294
Come on, crack open

08:50.361 --> 08:51.762
the change purse
a little, missy.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.163
This is for charity.

08:53.231 --> 08:54.498
You know, sometimes
I don't have

08:54.566 --> 08:55.933
enough faith
in Sabrina.

08:56.001 --> 08:59.003
She turned right around
and gave away her new things.

08:59.070 --> 09:02.272
She's giving up her Saturday
to work on a charity drive.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.141
That girl has
a heart of gold.

09:04.209 --> 09:06.310
Well, it does run
in the family.

09:06.378 --> 09:11.281
That napkin's not free.

09:11.349 --> 09:13.017
Sabrina, can I get
a little help over here?

09:13.085 --> 09:15.152
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll be right there.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.621
Oh, cool watch.

09:17.689 --> 09:18.556
I have one like that

09:18.624 --> 09:20.191
in my collection
of pristine watches

09:20.259 --> 09:22.226
that are still in their
original packaging,

09:22.294 --> 09:23.760
but I forgot
to buy one to wear. Ha!

09:23.828 --> 09:25.296
I think the
cream's spoiled.

09:25.364 --> 09:26.830
This smell
funny to you?

09:26.898 --> 09:28.065
No. I think it's her.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.405
This box would be perfect
to store my gold brick.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.040
I'll give you
25 cents for it.

09:36.108 --> 09:37.375
But it's marked
ten dollars.

09:37.442 --> 09:38.375
I'm haggling.

09:38.443 --> 09:39.310
I get it.

09:39.377 --> 09:40.644
Nine dollars.

09:40.712 --> 09:44.548
25 cents and I don't
write you a detention slip.

09:44.616 --> 09:45.950
Sold...

09:46.018 --> 09:48.786
to the man
with the vicious scowl.

09:48.854 --> 09:50.387
Hey, cool lion.

09:50.455 --> 09:51.622
Hey, thanks.

09:51.689 --> 09:53.423
Hey, listen, I was just
talking to Sabrina...

09:53.491 --> 09:55.460
Yeah, didn't she bring
some great stuff?

09:55.460 --> 09:56.860
I just bought this hat.

09:56.928 --> 09:59.296
Look, I know you think
I don't like her,

09:59.364 --> 10:01.532
so don't take this
the wrong way--

10:01.600 --> 10:02.700
but she reeks.

10:07.072 --> 10:09.707
Okay, Sparky, now
that you're calmed down

10:09.774 --> 10:11.409
and you have
your leash on

10:11.477 --> 10:13.677
I'm going to take
you for a walk.

10:13.745 --> 10:15.780
Walk!

10:15.848 --> 10:17.615
No!

10:17.682 --> 10:20.284
What do you
mean, I reek?

10:20.352 --> 10:22.854
So much for being able
to tell each other anything.

10:22.921 --> 10:25.590
Sure, I've noticed
a putrid, rotted, spoiled smell,

10:25.624 --> 10:27.592
but it could only
be coming from me

10:27.659 --> 10:29.260
if I was... spoiled rotten.

10:29.328 --> 10:30.528
Excuse me.

10:34.833 --> 10:38.469
Hickory dickory clock,
we've always got time for you.

10:38.537 --> 10:39.937
Hi. It's just me
checking in.

10:40.004 --> 10:42.373
So, that was a close call
on that get-itis thing, huh?

10:42.441 --> 10:44.342
Well, you did have us worried,
but you turned it around.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.043
Uh, for the sake
of conversation,

10:46.111 --> 10:47.378
let's say I hadn't.

10:47.446 --> 10:48.946
You'd become spoiled rotten.

10:49.014 --> 10:49.947
Literally?

10:50.015 --> 10:50.848
Of course.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.550
Aunt Hilda...

10:52.618 --> 10:53.650
She's not here.

10:53.718 --> 10:54.184
(click)

10:54.252 --> 10:55.353
Hello?

10:55.420 --> 10:57.588
Are you here
to buy something?

10:57.656 --> 10:59.256
I just thought that
some of your customers

10:59.324 --> 11:01.392
might get hungry while
they're junk shopping.

11:01.459 --> 11:02.726
Don't play innocent with me.

11:02.794 --> 11:05.229
You're trying
to help the Hondurans
more than we are.

11:05.297 --> 11:06.330
What are you going
to do about it?

11:06.398 --> 11:08.632
Free brownies
with every purchase.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.200
No, no, no,
no, no. Oh! Oh!

11:12.904 --> 11:13.604
Sabrina?

11:13.671 --> 11:15.439
Oh, Aunt Hilda.

11:15.507 --> 11:17.641
Oh, what is
that disgusting smell?

11:17.709 --> 11:20.344
Not me. I think
we have a little
sewage problem.

11:20.412 --> 11:21.778
Oh.

11:21.846 --> 11:23.714
Oh, I had a pair like those.

11:23.782 --> 11:26.383
Oh, who doesn't
have rhinestone
encrusted aardvarks?

11:26.451 --> 11:28.051
Me. That's who.

11:28.119 --> 11:29.220
Well, they can't be mine.

11:29.287 --> 11:30.287
Mine are magical.

11:30.355 --> 11:31.956
What?
Yeah.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.557
They turn your hair
a different color

11:33.592 --> 11:34.592
every ten minutes--
impulse buy.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.060
I wonder where
those are?

11:36.128 --> 11:37.361
Oh, they're probably

11:37.429 --> 11:39.563
up in the attic
with the rest

11:39.631 --> 11:40.998
of the magical junk.

11:41.066 --> 11:42.100
Well, I'm going to go
get more brownies.

11:42.167 --> 11:44.335
I have not yet
begun to fight.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.404
Okay, don't panic.

11:46.471 --> 11:47.771
So I've sold magical items

11:47.839 --> 11:49.373
to half of Westbridge,
and I'm...

11:51.042 --> 11:53.143
spoiling rotten.

11:53.211 --> 11:54.545
I always thought
the end of the world

11:54.612 --> 11:56.547
would involve more locusts.

12:04.823 --> 12:06.890
Sabrina, what
are you doing?

12:06.958 --> 12:08.092
Uh, I just remembered--

12:08.160 --> 12:09.326
this stuff was stored

12:09.394 --> 12:11.462
very close to our collection
of asbestos dust.

12:14.499 --> 12:15.466
Hey.

12:17.769 --> 12:19.337
Thanks.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.606
(Brooklyn accent):
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:22.674 --> 12:25.475
Sweetness, I asked youse
for two percent.

12:25.543 --> 12:28.846
This is skim.
I think we got a problem here.

12:28.913 --> 12:29.446
Yeah. You.

12:29.514 --> 12:32.083
Are you talking to me?

12:32.150 --> 12:35.452
'Cause if you are,
bring those lips closer.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.322
Food?

12:38.390 --> 12:40.124
But I just fed you.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.392
Food?

12:41.459 --> 12:42.559
(sighs)

12:42.628 --> 12:44.662
Oh, I can't take
those sad, puppyman eyes.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.797
Take it.

12:46.865 --> 12:51.302
Oh, you're
an animal.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.337
(sniffing)

12:53.404 --> 12:54.671
Salem, emergency!

12:54.739 --> 12:55.939
My room-- now!

12:57.943 --> 12:59.644
(yelping)

12:59.711 --> 13:01.479
Oh, come on,
it's not that bad.

13:02.547 --> 13:04.615
Salem, make that crisis!

13:04.716 --> 13:06.083
My room-- now!

13:06.151 --> 13:08.252
I'm usually opposed
to calling in the Feds

13:08.319 --> 13:11.421
but don't you think we might
want to alert the aunties?

13:11.489 --> 13:12.356
Are you kidding?
Admit that

13:12.424 --> 13:13.991
I gave away their stuff
without permission?

13:14.058 --> 13:15.659
Do you know nothing
about teen rebellion?

13:15.727 --> 13:17.561
I know what it smells like.

13:17.629 --> 13:19.597
Oh, here it is--
"get-itis.

13:19.664 --> 13:22.233
Subparagraph 12:
Spoiled rotten."

13:22.300 --> 13:23.667
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

13:23.734 --> 13:24.735
"horrible person..."

13:24.803 --> 13:26.270
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

13:26.337 --> 13:27.704
"slimy ooze..." Oh!

13:27.772 --> 13:29.206
"To reverse
the spoiling process,

13:29.274 --> 13:30.875
that which was lost
must be regained."

13:30.942 --> 13:32.476
What does that mean?

13:32.543 --> 13:34.979
That the democrats
need to win back the congress?

13:35.047 --> 13:35.846
Wait, I get it.

13:35.914 --> 13:37.214
It means that
I have to get back

13:37.282 --> 13:39.082
all the stuff I gave away
from the attic.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.718
Only someone spoiled rotten
would give away

13:40.786 --> 13:42.119
stuff that didn't
belong to them.

13:42.187 --> 13:43.954
You were giving away stuff?

13:44.021 --> 13:44.989
Let's see, um...

13:45.057 --> 13:46.290
Mrs. Quick
bought that medal.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.125
That must be why
she's acting so strange.

13:48.193 --> 13:50.261
By all means,
blame the medal.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.797
Uh... Brad bought
some stupid bronze lion.

13:53.865 --> 13:56.233
How bad could that be?

13:56.301 --> 13:59.703
(growling)
(crying)

13:59.771 --> 14:01.938
Nice kitty! Oh...

14:02.006 --> 14:03.440
(roaring)

14:03.508 --> 14:04.875
Uh, Harvey had some hat

14:04.943 --> 14:07.778
and Mr. Kraft bought
some sort of little box.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.414
Not Zelda's
replicating box?!

14:10.482 --> 14:11.849
Maybe. Well,
I'm sure he hasn't

14:11.916 --> 14:13.417
figured out
how to use it yet.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.519
Wow, you know,

14:15.587 --> 14:18.088
this box could probably
replicate anything.

14:18.156 --> 14:21.058
Like food, or medicine...

14:21.126 --> 14:22.893
Nah.

14:22.961 --> 14:25.296
Okay, I've just got to round up
half a dozen magical objects

14:25.397 --> 14:26.797
before I liquefy. Easy.

14:26.865 --> 14:27.965
There's just
one more problem.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.066
What's that?

14:29.134 --> 14:29.933
I hawk up things

14:30.001 --> 14:31.635
that smell better
than you.

14:33.905 --> 14:35.205
Any better?

14:38.243 --> 14:40.144
Finally. Do you have
any idea how hard it is

14:40.212 --> 14:42.746
to walk with six pairs
of odor-eaters in your shoes?

14:46.718 --> 14:48.119
Are we going out?
Are we going out?

14:48.186 --> 14:50.121
No, we're not going out.

14:50.188 --> 14:52.089
<i>I'm</i> going out.

14:52.157 --> 14:54.224
Bad dogman!

14:54.292 --> 14:55.726
I thought it would be a fun way

14:55.794 --> 14:57.728
to keep track
of how everyone is doing.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.196
Namely, how badly

14:59.231 --> 15:00.464
my rummage sale is trouncing

15:00.531 --> 15:02.032
your flour-covered butts!

15:02.067 --> 15:03.534
If you think that
glorified garage sale

15:03.602 --> 15:04.902
is going to beat...

15:04.970 --> 15:06.937
Ladies, ladies, please.

15:07.005 --> 15:09.974
Let's not forget
what's important.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.276
Helping the Hondurans?

15:12.343 --> 15:14.278
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Whatever.

15:14.345 --> 15:15.713
Hilda...

15:15.814 --> 15:17.448
stop. I know what
you're going to say.

15:17.515 --> 15:19.550
"You're being
mean-spirited
and aggressive."

15:19.618 --> 15:20.951
Normally, I would
let you go on.

15:21.019 --> 15:23.620
But you see that medal
around Mrs. Quick's neck?

15:23.688 --> 15:26.357
I think that's my old
"competitive spirit" medal.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.291
Remember the one mother
used to make me wear

15:28.359 --> 15:29.492
when I played field hockey,

15:29.560 --> 15:31.428
because she said
I had no killer instinct?

15:31.496 --> 15:33.330
Man, you were such a priss!

15:33.398 --> 15:36.133
That's why she's being
so competitive.

15:36.201 --> 15:37.601
What's your excuse?

15:39.371 --> 15:40.504
Mrs. Quick...

15:40.572 --> 15:41.905
what a lovely medal.

15:41.973 --> 15:42.973
Oh!

15:43.040 --> 15:44.208
May I see it
for a moment?

15:44.276 --> 15:45.042
Okay.

15:47.512 --> 15:51.081
This really is
a charming bake sale.

15:51.149 --> 15:52.849
What do you call these?

15:52.917 --> 15:55.085
Also-rans?

15:55.153 --> 15:58.388
We're number one!
We're number one!

15:58.456 --> 16:00.023
Then again, she may be
a competitive nut

16:00.091 --> 16:01.625
all on her own.

16:06.897 --> 16:08.199
Here.

16:08.266 --> 16:10.534
Sabrina, what on earth
are you wearing?

16:10.602 --> 16:12.269
And would you care
to explain this?

16:12.336 --> 16:14.137
Uh, a <i>Glamour</i> don't and no.

16:14.205 --> 16:16.173
Gotta go.

16:19.244 --> 16:23.079
What? All's I said was,
"Walk that by me one more time."

16:23.147 --> 16:24.615
Harvey...

16:24.683 --> 16:27.851
Hey. Lookin' good.

16:27.919 --> 16:30.420
How's about youse plant
a wet one on your old man?

16:30.488 --> 16:32.122
Ah, give me that hat.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.726
Sabrina, you have car
deodorizers in your ears.

16:35.794 --> 16:38.762
Well, they'd look ridiculous
on my shoes.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.464
Have you seen, uh...
Brad or Mr. Kraft?

16:40.532 --> 16:43.567
Mr. Kraft said he was going
to Y2K-proof his computer

16:43.635 --> 16:45.902
"before the millennium bug
rains anarchy

16:45.970 --> 16:47.638
down on our pitiful world."

16:47.706 --> 16:49.473
And I don't know
what happened to Brad.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.274
Well, I'm sure he's fine.

16:51.342 --> 16:53.944
(whimpering)

16:54.012 --> 16:55.378
Here.

16:55.446 --> 16:56.847
Okay, that was my last Skittle.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.515
You're not still hungry,
are you?

16:58.583 --> 17:01.185
(roaring)
(screams)

17:02.721 --> 17:04.253
Please be here.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.659
Mr. Kraft!

17:08.726 --> 17:10.426
Mr. Kraft!

17:10.494 --> 17:11.295
What do you want?

17:11.362 --> 17:12.396
Uh, there's
a little problem

17:12.464 --> 17:13.496
with the box
you bought...

17:13.564 --> 17:14.498
No, there is no
problem with that box.

17:14.566 --> 17:15.799
It's absolutely
perfect-- thank you.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.601
I really don't
have time for this.

17:19.537 --> 17:22.138
Miss Spellman,
get out!

17:22.207 --> 17:23.973
These bricks are mine, all mine.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.409
You can't have any of them.
Not even one.

17:26.477 --> 17:27.511
I don't want any of your bricks.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.879
I just want my box back, please?

17:28.947 --> 17:31.948
What kind of idiot
do you think I am?

17:32.016 --> 17:34.117
Talk about your essay questions.

17:34.185 --> 17:35.819
What's happening to your legs?

17:35.887 --> 17:36.887
Look at you!

17:36.955 --> 17:38.755
Oh, no!

17:38.823 --> 17:39.689
Uh, l-l-look at you!

17:39.757 --> 17:40.990
You're a paranoid mess!

17:41.058 --> 17:42.392
A rich paranoid mess.

17:42.460 --> 17:44.361
Oh. You're so consumed
with making your bricks,

17:44.429 --> 17:46.296
I bet you forgot
which one was special,

17:46.364 --> 17:47.798
which one you worked
so hard for.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.233
Sure, I know.
It was this one...

17:49.300 --> 17:51.635
No, it was this one...
no, it was... no, it...

17:51.702 --> 17:53.770
And how many is it going to take
to make you happy, huh?

17:53.838 --> 17:54.938
1,000? 2,000 bricks?

17:55.006 --> 17:56.607
A dozen watches?
Hundreds of sweaters?

17:56.674 --> 17:58.442
I have three sweaters, tops.

17:58.509 --> 18:00.644
Look at how pathetic we are--
you with your bricks

18:00.712 --> 18:02.178
and me with all my stuff

18:02.246 --> 18:04.114
and we've completely forgotten
about the people of Honduras.

18:04.181 --> 18:05.582
I never met them!

18:05.650 --> 18:07.851
You know, I've been such
an enormous spoiled brat.

18:07.919 --> 18:10.220
I mean, it wasn't the things
in the attic I lost.

18:10.288 --> 18:12.022
It was my appreciation

18:12.090 --> 18:13.757
for what's really important--
people!

18:13.825 --> 18:15.559
Hey! I stopped rotting!

18:16.694 --> 18:18.428
What happened?

18:18.496 --> 18:20.197
Wait a minute.

18:20.264 --> 18:22.599
Who... who are you?

18:22.666 --> 18:24.435
I know.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.270
You're one of those aliens,
aren't you?

18:27.338 --> 18:29.239
Okay.

18:33.645 --> 18:34.745
You're too smart for us,
Willard.

18:34.812 --> 18:35.913
We couldn't fool you

18:35.980 --> 18:37.347
by pretending to be
one of your students.

18:37.415 --> 18:41.818
Well, I am a little sharper
than your average Earthling.

18:41.886 --> 18:42.953
Silence!

18:43.021 --> 18:44.021
Give me our box.

18:44.088 --> 18:45.122
Of course. I'm sorry.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.023
Take it.

18:47.091 --> 18:49.359
And donate all your bricks
to the charity drive.

18:49.427 --> 18:51.194
All of them?

18:51.262 --> 18:52.596
Don't make me
fire up the probe.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.698
No.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.934
Sabrina, where did you
get all this?

18:57.002 --> 18:58.835
Oh, just junk
I had lying around.

18:58.903 --> 19:01.038
Figured I didn't
need it anymore.

19:01.105 --> 19:02.405
Ooh! A new
DVD player.

19:02.473 --> 19:04.007
I'll give you 50 bucks.

19:04.075 --> 19:04.941
Yes!

19:05.009 --> 19:06.976
We're going to win
this time, for sure.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.111
We will
drink deep

19:08.146 --> 19:09.747
from the cup

19:09.781 --> 19:11.749
of our enemy's annihilation!

19:11.816 --> 19:13.016
(laughing)

19:13.084 --> 19:15.652
How could I lose?

19:15.720 --> 19:17.887
KRAFT:
And so, I am happy

19:17.989 --> 19:19.656
to give this gold to the needy.

19:19.724 --> 19:21.759
Charity should span all borders

19:21.826 --> 19:25.195
be they earthly or... beyond.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.931
I still think Zelda and I
could have pulled it off

19:27.998 --> 19:29.599
if something...
or someone

19:29.667 --> 19:31.568
hadn't eaten
all our cookies.

19:33.538 --> 19:34.938
Mrs. Quick, I know
how hard you worked

19:35.005 --> 19:36.006
on the charity drive

19:36.074 --> 19:37.374
and that's why I want
to give you this.

19:37.475 --> 19:38.676
Your charm bracelet?

19:38.743 --> 19:40.310
Oh, Sabrina, I couldn't.

19:40.378 --> 19:42.312
You've already
given so much

19:42.380 --> 19:43.980
and it means
so much to you.

19:44.048 --> 19:45.282
But that's why
I want you to have it,

19:45.350 --> 19:46.683
because I know
it'll make you happy

19:46.751 --> 19:48.052
and that means
so much more to me.

19:48.119 --> 19:49.886
Oh, thank you,
Sabrina.

19:49.921 --> 19:53.323
I hope I don't have to
declare this on my taxes.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.293
You know, Sabrina,

19:56.360 --> 19:59.463
in a strange way, we're
actually very proud of you.

19:59.564 --> 20:01.899
For being
an obnoxious spoiled brat

20:01.966 --> 20:03.066
giving away family treasures,

20:03.134 --> 20:04.835
almost rotting into a slimy glob

20:04.902 --> 20:06.470
and convincing your boyfriend

20:06.538 --> 20:08.505
that he was accosted
by aliens?

20:08.573 --> 20:10.940
I said in a strange way.

20:11.008 --> 20:12.443
Hey, have you seen Brad?

20:12.543 --> 20:14.244
I've been calling
him for hours.

20:14.312 --> 20:16.246
Uh, Brad...

20:19.717 --> 20:21.318
I'd like to return this.

20:21.419 --> 20:22.185
Hi, Brad.

20:22.253 --> 20:23.052
Um, you know what?

20:23.188 --> 20:24.888
You're our 26th
customer today,

20:24.956 --> 20:27.157
so you get a free T-shirt.

20:27.225 --> 20:30.260
And some topical ointment.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.031
But I don't <i>want</i>
to get rid of him.

20:35.099 --> 20:36.300
I love him.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.535
We all do, but he's too much
responsibility for you.

20:38.603 --> 20:40.337
And Sparky's going to love
being with his new family.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.339
I hear they have a huge farm
in the Other Realm and...

20:42.440 --> 20:43.707
(bell chiming)

20:43.774 --> 20:45.809
(thunder cracking)

20:45.877 --> 20:48.711
Someone's here, someone's
here, someone's here!

20:52.483 --> 20:54.484
We're the Midbys.
We're here for Sparky.

20:54.552 --> 20:55.786
Yeah, we're here
for Sparky.

20:55.854 --> 20:57.787
I'm going
to miss you, boy.

20:57.855 --> 20:58.955
Son, he's your
responsibility.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.390
I'll take care
of him, I promise.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.925
Think I can
have a llama?
