00:43.058 --> 00:44.936
Edward is dead?

00:44.938 --> 00:46.458
His brother Richard, too.

00:47.778 --> 00:49.496
It's the talk of court.

00:49.498 --> 00:52.296
Their boat sank in a storm at sea,
they both drowned.

00:52.298 --> 00:54.858
There are no bodies to prove this,
it could just be a rumour?

00:54.997 --> 00:56.475
Margaret, look at the weather,

00:56.477 --> 00:58.157
it would take a miracle
to survive this.

00:58.209 --> 01:00.889
Besides, we know God is on our side.

01:02.444 --> 01:06.122
Yet he gives Elizabeth a son,
her dead husband an heir!

01:06.124 --> 01:08.202
Really, if it's God's
will for Henry to be king,

01:08.204 --> 01:11.764
why does he put another
obstacle in the way?

01:16.484 --> 01:19.084
Where is he? Isabel, where's George?

01:20.324 --> 01:21.564
Where is he?

01:27.244 --> 01:28.804
He had a visitor.

01:30.004 --> 01:32.124
One of his mother's ladies.

01:33.164 --> 01:35.242
She offered George
a way back to York.

01:35.244 --> 01:37.602
Full pardon, titles returned.

01:37.604 --> 01:41.002
If he fought for them.

01:41.004 --> 01:44.362
I brought you here
to keep him close!

01:44.364 --> 01:47.284
And now he's joined forces
with Edward?!

01:50.644 --> 01:52.684
I am not your spy!

01:54.524 --> 01:56.324
Nor his keeper.

02:06.604 --> 02:07.844
Your Grace.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.082
We'll take you somewhere quiet,

02:11.084 --> 02:13.924
where you may pray for
a happy ending to our worries.

02:20.124 --> 02:21.164
I must...

02:22.324 --> 02:23.482
I shall...

02:23.484 --> 02:27.082
I'm taking the King to
the Tower for his protection.

02:27.084 --> 02:30.362
The sons of York have united
and mean to take back the throne.

02:30.364 --> 02:32.722
My Lords,
we heard Edward perished at sea.

02:32.724 --> 02:34.002
You heard wrong.

02:34.004 --> 02:36.962
My spies in the North claim he's
landed and is about to attack.

02:36.964 --> 02:40.562
Go home, raise men
and wait my call to arms.

02:40.564 --> 02:43.044
I will await Margaret of Anjou's
call to arms!

02:48.004 --> 02:51.962
And a true Lancastrian
will protect OUR King.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.164
My Lord, the Duke of Somerset.

02:58.884 --> 03:00.522
God save the King!

03:00.524 --> 03:02.644
God save the King!

03:11.284 --> 03:14.002
Margaret, you should go back
to Stafford Manor...

03:14.004 --> 03:17.124
No, I should stay... for my son.

03:18.244 --> 03:21.722
No, London will rise up for Edward.
He is much admired here.

03:21.724 --> 03:24.564
I must go back to Wales
and raise men to fight.

03:26.364 --> 03:28.042
I need to take Henry with me.

03:28.044 --> 03:30.322
No... Margaret, you know
what's about to happen.

03:30.324 --> 03:33.362
He's second to the throne.
He's too vulnerable in London.

03:33.364 --> 03:37.084
We will go to Wales,
await Margaret's army...

03:38.804 --> 03:40.564
and prepare for war.

04:00.684 --> 04:02.802
We'll never reach England!

04:02.804 --> 04:04.602
It's madness,
sailing into this wind!

04:04.604 --> 04:07.964
The captain claims it is safe.
With a blade held to his neck!

04:28.004 --> 04:30.002
Please, don't leave me!

04:30.004 --> 04:32.202
You know I can't come.

04:32.204 --> 04:34.482
You're a princess,
you must sail with the Queen.

04:34.484 --> 04:37.642
I shall be just behind you
with the fleet.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.882
What if Isabel was right
and this whole campaign is cursed?

04:40.884 --> 04:42.842
Father failed to make
her husband king.

04:42.844 --> 04:44.564
What if he can't put mine
on the throne?

04:46.124 --> 04:49.764
Your father rests his hopes on you.
Think of him.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.564
How proud he'll be, calling
his favourite "Princess Anne".

04:56.364 --> 04:58.964
I do want him to know I'm trying
to play my part.

05:00.404 --> 05:01.924
Then be brave.

05:06.524 --> 05:08.404
Do as they say.

05:18.564 --> 05:22.404
And do not, whatever you do,
cross that woman.

05:36.324 --> 05:39.002
Cousin?

05:39.004 --> 05:40.802
Edmund?

05:40.804 --> 05:42.722
Margaret, I'm rather engaged.

05:42.724 --> 05:44.884
This is in all of our interests.

05:46.404 --> 05:48.162
You know my husband.

05:48.164 --> 05:50.242
Henry Stafford. Course. Good man.

05:50.244 --> 05:52.362
Mm, he's respected.

05:52.364 --> 05:55.282
And he could, if he wished, raise
an army of tenants for our cause.

05:55.284 --> 05:57.122
He is not loyal to our King?

05:57.124 --> 06:00.642
Sir Henry's a "man of peace".

06:00.644 --> 06:04.202
We all want peace.
Sometimes a man must defend his own.

06:04.204 --> 06:06.522
Precisely what I've been
telling him,

06:06.524 --> 06:08.722
only he somehow won't
hear it from me.

06:08.724 --> 06:11.842
But if a man, close to the King,
were to raise this with him...

06:11.844 --> 06:15.162
I'm sure I can help him
see the light - some good ale,

06:15.164 --> 06:17.282
a bit of persuasion...

06:17.284 --> 06:20.722
Henry Stafford is not some young
maiden disposed to sweet-talk.

06:20.724 --> 06:22.442
He's refused us before.

06:22.444 --> 06:24.522
You must remind him of that,

06:24.524 --> 06:28.802
of our King's debt to those who
honour him and what may happen

06:28.804 --> 06:31.242
if he were to make another
pitiful judgment.

06:31.244 --> 06:32.562
Rest assured, cousin.

06:32.564 --> 06:35.044
Inform Sir Henry I shall be
joining him for supper later.

07:46.964 --> 07:50.564
Stay back! Do not come any closer!

07:53.004 --> 07:54.564
Who are you?!

08:00.564 --> 08:01.842
Edward!

08:01.844 --> 08:04.362
Thank God. You came back to me.

08:04.364 --> 08:06.404
Of course I did. I always do.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.962
How did you get past the guards?

08:09.964 --> 08:13.402
Warwick has no men here,
they're gathering for the battle.

08:13.404 --> 08:18.522
Elizabeth, George has been
good to his word.

08:18.524 --> 08:20.404
The sons of York are... Listen!

08:22.004 --> 08:24.044
The sons of York are reunited.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.602
But we must face the Lancastrian
Army in the coming days.

08:28.604 --> 08:30.722
I can't stay.

08:30.724 --> 08:33.202
I had to see you...

08:33.203 --> 08:35.203
see my son.

08:38.323 --> 08:40.922
He's a fine weight.

08:40.924 --> 08:42.922
Look, he has your chin.

08:42.924 --> 08:45.564
He has your wide feet.

08:48.644 --> 08:50.922
I've been gone too, too long.

08:50.924 --> 08:54.004
I pray this is not
the only time we meet.

08:55.444 --> 08:58.122
I'll come home,

08:58.124 --> 09:00.084
keep you safe...

09:01.444 --> 09:03.364
make this land better for you.

09:04.764 --> 09:08.484
I love you, little prince.

09:22.844 --> 09:24.684
Damn Warwick.

09:26.324 --> 09:28.562
Making me run like a coward...

09:28.564 --> 09:31.122
driving me here
to have my son in a dungeon!

09:31.124 --> 09:33.204
We are fine.

09:34.964 --> 09:38.482
Be angry, be vengeful,

09:38.484 --> 09:39.882
but never shamed.

09:39.884 --> 09:42.204
You ran for your life.
Nobody blames you.

09:46.324 --> 09:50.242
I've been ambushed, captured,

09:50.244 --> 09:52.362
but I was never afraid.

09:52.364 --> 09:57.204
I was... I was young,
fearless, a king.

09:59.284 --> 10:01.604
Knowing that Warwick
wants me dead...

10:02.884 --> 10:04.682
Now I have a son

10:04.684 --> 10:08.444
and I know there will be life
beyond me... Shhh.

10:10.644 --> 10:14.002
If we win, I will make sure

10:14.004 --> 10:16.442
this never happens again. When.

10:16.444 --> 10:18.724
WHEN you win.

10:21.684 --> 10:23.444
You know Warwick.

10:24.804 --> 10:27.524
You know him.
You know his ways.

10:29.444 --> 10:31.524
He taught me everything I know.

10:33.004 --> 10:34.764
He made me king.

10:36.284 --> 10:37.844
I loved him.

10:41.044 --> 10:42.644
Now, I must kill him.

10:58.644 --> 11:02.244
You're going now,
to fight the York Army?

11:03.484 --> 11:05.044
What about me?

11:08.204 --> 11:09.764
Where do I stand?

11:10.764 --> 11:14.242
You are Lancaster,
George is York, Anne is my enemy,

11:14.244 --> 11:15.564
and Mother is with her.

11:17.204 --> 11:18.922
But I am all on my own!

11:18.924 --> 11:22.362
You will be fine, whatever happens.

11:22.364 --> 11:25.762
If I win, you've nothing to fear.

11:25.764 --> 11:27.922
If I lose,
you're still married to George,

11:27.924 --> 11:30.244
you're still Duchess of Clarence.

11:34.324 --> 11:36.642
Just be wary.

11:36.644 --> 11:39.242
Commit to nobody until you know
there is a clear winner,

11:39.244 --> 11:42.164
and then remind them
of your undying loyalty...

11:43.884 --> 11:47.924
until it serves you no more.

12:03.364 --> 12:06.002
John, why are there tenants
in the house?

12:06.004 --> 12:10.562
Getting their commissions, My Lady.
Sir Henry's taking them into battle.

12:10.564 --> 12:15.362
Oh, God! Oh, God!

12:15.364 --> 12:18.164
Oh, God!

12:19.364 --> 12:20.404
Good day, My Lord.

12:22.204 --> 12:24.324
Good man. Make your mark here.
My Lord.

12:26.844 --> 12:28.124
Make ready.

12:29.204 --> 12:31.402
Lady Margaret. Sir Reginald.

12:31.404 --> 12:35.642
God bless you.
Oh, bless you, Henry, truly!

12:35.644 --> 12:38.362
Margaret, Margaret, please, just...
I'm, I'm afraid...

12:38.364 --> 12:39.722
Oh, no, don't be, don't be.

12:39.724 --> 12:43.802
You are doing God's work,
for the king he appointed.

12:43.804 --> 12:46.362
I'm afraid I'm fighting for York.

12:46.364 --> 12:48.722
I'm leading the men
to serve King Edward,

12:48.724 --> 12:51.364
because I think he'll win,
put an end to war.

12:52.804 --> 12:54.322
I know this disappoints you.

12:54.324 --> 12:58.082
But my, my cousin, Edmund...
you spoke at length...

12:58.084 --> 12:59.802
He spoke, I humoured him.

12:59.804 --> 13:02.002
Don't get others to beg
on your behalf, Margaret,

13:02.004 --> 13:04.362
it demeans you
and you are far more compelling.

13:04.364 --> 13:08.322
What reason could you possibly have?

13:08.324 --> 13:11.162
The only time we've known peace
was during King Edward's reign.

13:11.164 --> 13:12.842
Now he has a son, it's my duty

13:12.844 --> 13:15.042
to ensure that his succession
is peaceful.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.602
His success? His, HIS son?

13:17.604 --> 13:19.442
Look, your house does not
deserve to rule -

13:19.444 --> 13:22.362
the King's half-mad,
his wife's a tyrant.

13:22.364 --> 13:25.042
She hates this country
and their son is vile!

13:25.044 --> 13:28.802
You would defy a king
appointed by God himself?

13:28.804 --> 13:31.922
Oh, I don't see God in these people.
Look, what I'm doing is right,

13:31.924 --> 13:36.242
I believe it's right
and it's for the good of all...

13:36.244 --> 13:40.322
You, you would have me torn -
husband one side, family the other?

13:40.324 --> 13:44.642
Margaret, this is not about you,
your ambition -

13:44.644 --> 13:49.044
this is for the safety,
the future of this land.

13:54.924 --> 13:57.722
You do this
and I will not forgive you.

13:57.724 --> 13:59.882
I will not pray for your return.

13:59.884 --> 14:01.402
You will be dead to me.

14:01.404 --> 14:04.002
Do you hear me, Henry Stafford?

14:04.004 --> 14:06.244
You will be dead to me!

14:31.084 --> 14:32.524
God bless you, Margaret.

14:34.044 --> 14:36.284
Even though you will not
say it to me.

15:09.444 --> 15:11.164
Go up on deck and take some air.

15:13.164 --> 15:15.084
It stinks of bile and fear in here.

15:16.764 --> 15:18.044
I'm fine, really.

15:19.244 --> 15:23.724
Really? I've seen heads on spikes
looking healthier than you.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.242
Just not sure I'd make it.

15:27.244 --> 15:29.644
Oh, don't be pathetic,
of course you will.

15:30.884 --> 15:35.484
You want something enough,
you can get it, always.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.404
Yes, Your Grace.

15:41.844 --> 15:43.764
You're weaker than I thought.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.722
I see something of Isabel,

15:49.724 --> 15:52.962
but sadly, little of Lord Warwick.

15:52.964 --> 15:57.242
I am not weak, nor like my sister.

15:57.244 --> 16:01.444
Who are you, then?
I have no sense of Anne.

16:03.124 --> 16:06.604
And I'm interested to know
what kind of queen you will be.

16:09.324 --> 16:11.282
Haven't thought about it.

16:11.284 --> 16:14.042
You're the Kingmaker's daughter.

16:14.044 --> 16:16.244
You think about it.

16:30.164 --> 16:33.802
Your husband will face our enemy
at Barnet, north of London.

16:33.804 --> 16:36.722
There is talk that Warwick
has three times the troops

16:36.724 --> 16:38.522
and still awaits reinforcements.

16:38.524 --> 16:40.602
So, Margaret of Anjou has landed?

16:40.604 --> 16:42.882
Nobody knows where she is.

16:42.884 --> 16:46.442
But she will have set sail, soon as
there was a break in the weather.

16:46.444 --> 16:48.722
She could even be marching
to join forces.

16:48.724 --> 16:52.522
Surely Edward would fall back,
take the Tower, set a siege?

16:52.524 --> 16:54.802
The King prepares to fight.

16:54.804 --> 16:58.082
Edward must defeat Warwick
to keep the crown.

16:58.084 --> 17:02.602
But if the Thames mist
were to rise as high as Barnet,

17:02.604 --> 17:04.604
who'd even know the army was there?

19:13.884 --> 19:19.122
Other commanders will ask you to
stay and fight till the death.

19:19.124 --> 19:22.204
Whilst readying their horses
to flee.

19:23.804 --> 19:26.122
But let this be my pledge to you.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.204
I will not ride off and leave you.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.844
I will stay and fight by your side!

22:47.164 --> 22:48.802
How many of my ships have landed?

22:48.804 --> 22:52.444
All but one, although they are
scattered along the south coast.

23:02.324 --> 23:05.444
Forget Warwick,
we must rethink our plans.

23:10.324 --> 23:14.722
Your Graces, I come
direct... directly from London.

23:14.724 --> 23:16.962
Your husband... the King...

23:16.964 --> 23:19.242
Imprisoned, imprisoned in the Tower,
I know.

23:19.244 --> 23:21.524
And how heavy were our losses
at Barnet?

23:24.004 --> 23:25.642
Very. Course they were.

23:25.644 --> 23:30.802
Let's assume Edward knows we've
landed, that he'll come for us.

23:30.804 --> 23:33.004
Is my father coming here too?

23:35.844 --> 23:38.082
My father! What of Lord Warwick?

23:38.084 --> 23:39.284
Dead...

23:41.804 --> 23:43.764
obviously, or he would be here.

23:49.164 --> 23:53.402
On the battlefield, Your Grace,
the most noble death.

23:53.404 --> 23:55.282
No. No, no, no.

23:55.284 --> 23:59.082
No, he can't be, he's the Kingmaker.

23:59.084 --> 24:02.202
He lives to see my son
on the throne... he lives...

24:02.204 --> 24:05.722
He was a great man. Honourable.

24:05.724 --> 24:08.402
He killed his own horse to prove
that he would not ride-off,

24:08.404 --> 24:11.042
leave his men to die. What?

24:11.044 --> 24:13.164
He fought and fell beside them.

24:19.444 --> 24:21.602
His forces must be depleted too?

24:21.604 --> 24:24.922
They have the taste of victory
in their mouths, dear.

24:24.924 --> 24:26.482
Be ready to move out.

24:26.484 --> 24:27.524
No.

24:29.244 --> 24:30.924
I do not run from fights.

24:33.204 --> 24:36.524
You would face Edward of York here,
with our numbers?

24:39.924 --> 24:41.284
What would you do?

24:45.644 --> 24:46.924
Head west.

24:48.604 --> 24:50.682
My father always said,

24:50.684 --> 24:54.042
"The south favours York,

24:54.044 --> 24:57.922
"but west countrymen
have no such affinity."

24:57.924 --> 24:59.922
Beg them for support.

24:59.924 --> 25:05.524
We are Lancastrians, we beg
for nothing. Do not speak again.

25:07.044 --> 25:09.882
It's good, it's good.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.484
You're thinking like me.

25:33.804 --> 25:36.124
Does Sir Henry really think
he might die?

25:38.684 --> 25:40.164
He's badly injured.

25:41.884 --> 25:44.922
I will go to him.
Reginald, prepare a cart.

25:44.924 --> 25:49.562
You... you can't ride to a
battlefield, it's not safe.

25:49.564 --> 25:51.802
Sir Henry would not want it
or allow it.

25:51.804 --> 25:54.162
Yes, well, I am your mistress
when he's not here.

25:54.164 --> 25:56.724
You will do as I say. Ready my
horse. No.

26:00.404 --> 26:02.242
It is hell on Earth.

26:02.244 --> 26:04.322
It is no place for a woman.

26:04.324 --> 26:07.204
Take me, Sir Reginald,
or I will go myself.

26:12.324 --> 26:14.642
Where's my liegeman Jasper Tudor?
Where is he now?

26:14.644 --> 26:16.282
Pembroke Castle, Your Grace.

26:16.284 --> 26:18.882
Send a messenger, we head to Wales.

26:18.884 --> 26:20.602
We'll cross through Gloucester.

26:20.604 --> 26:22.242
They've a bridge over the Severn.

26:22.244 --> 26:25.242
No. Gloucester's is in York hands.
They would fire on us.

26:25.244 --> 26:28.202
All right. Tewkesbury, then.

26:28.204 --> 26:29.644
They've a ford.

26:30.684 --> 26:33.882
Could you spare a guard
to take me to my mother?

26:33.884 --> 26:37.444
You do not want to come with us,
see if your suggestion pays off?

26:38.964 --> 26:41.082
I must tell her about my father.

26:41.084 --> 26:42.522
Oh, but she knows.

26:42.524 --> 26:45.324
She was told first,
by the boy who delivered this.

26:47.684 --> 26:51.804
She refused protection and took
sanctuary, in Beaulieu Abbey.

26:54.484 --> 26:56.322
I wish to see my mother.

26:56.324 --> 26:59.122
She has abandoned you
and lives in disgrace.

26:59.124 --> 27:01.402
Go to her and you will suffer
the same fate.

27:01.404 --> 27:04.002
No! We are Nevilles.

27:04.004 --> 27:05.882
One of the greatest families
in the land.

27:05.884 --> 27:09.282
Your name means nothing now.

27:09.284 --> 27:13.082
You will be arrested and York courts
show no mercy to traitors.

27:13.084 --> 27:16.522
But go, if that's what you want,

27:16.524 --> 27:18.484
we don't need you any more.

27:22.964 --> 27:24.564
Yes, you do.

27:26.204 --> 27:30.802
Your son needs an heir
or your line dies out.

27:30.804 --> 27:34.044
I could be carrying a future
King of England right now.

27:35.924 --> 27:39.922
I'll ride with you,
because there's a hope of victory,

27:39.924 --> 27:42.004
fulfilling my father's wish.

27:46.764 --> 27:48.164
We need each other.

28:51.284 --> 28:52.844
Help me.

29:05.324 --> 29:06.484
Margaret!

29:07.724 --> 29:10.482
What are you doing here?
It's... it's much too dangerous...

29:10.484 --> 29:13.682
I'm quite safe. Sir Reginald
and Young John brought me here.

29:13.684 --> 29:16.284
We have your physician
and a priest.

29:19.404 --> 29:21.522
It looks worse than it is.

29:21.524 --> 29:22.684
Please, don't worry.

29:23.924 --> 29:25.844
I brought a wagon to take you back.

29:28.124 --> 29:29.524
Oh, you needn't have...

29:31.404 --> 29:33.284
but I shall be glad
to see my home.

29:35.964 --> 29:38.564
So, York won.

29:43.004 --> 29:44.682
It is all over?

29:44.684 --> 29:45.804
So I thought.

29:47.724 --> 29:53.202
But the lad who dressed my wounds
tells me that Margaret of Anjou

29:53.204 --> 29:54.724
To Jasper?

29:55.884 --> 29:58.362
If Edward can catch Margaret
and put her in the Tower too,

29:58.364 --> 30:00.044
then it may finally be over.

30:03.604 --> 30:08.162
If she reaches Wales,
allies with Jasper,

30:08.164 --> 30:10.404
they'll go after Edward, finish him.

30:12.204 --> 30:13.324
Margaret...

30:14.924 --> 30:18.764
don't do anything to undermine
my efforts or those of my tenants.

30:20.804 --> 30:23.762
Accept the loss, accept King Edward

30:23.764 --> 30:25.202
and he'll look favourably on us.

30:25.204 --> 30:27.922
I'll ask your physician
to bring you fresh bandages.

30:27.924 --> 30:30.802
If Jasper goes against Edward
and loses,

30:30.804 --> 30:33.844
he will have to go into exile
once more, with your son.

30:36.204 --> 30:37.524
Is that what you want?

30:40.524 --> 30:42.642
Give up, Margaret.

30:42.644 --> 30:45.924
For once, for once,
please do as I ask.

30:47.444 --> 30:48.484
Promise me?

30:50.484 --> 30:51.804
Say it.

30:53.524 --> 30:54.604
I promise.

31:06.444 --> 31:09.162
'Dearest Jasper, terrible news -

31:09.164 --> 31:11.442
'my husband has turned against me

31:11.444 --> 31:14.602
'and fought for York at Barnet.

31:14.604 --> 31:18.522
'Warwick is dead and they have
our King, but there is hope.

31:18.524 --> 31:21.682
'Queen Margaret has landed
and rides to Wales

31:21.684 --> 31:24.082
'to join forces with you.

31:24.084 --> 31:29.442
'Invade. Seize this moment and
I will do all I can to support you.

31:29.444 --> 31:32.082
'For I will never give up.
That I promise.

31:32.084 --> 31:36.442
'God bless you and keep you safe
from harm. And keep my Henry safe.

31:36.444 --> 31:38.044
'Guard him with your life.'

31:48.884 --> 31:51.162
His head should be torn off

31:51.164 --> 31:53.962
and skewered on the Tower Gates
for all to see.

31:53.964 --> 31:56.202
That's the only way
to punish traitors.

31:56.204 --> 31:59.482
Bit rich, George, even for you.

31:59.484 --> 32:00.962
What was that, little brother?

32:00.964 --> 32:04.682
You went against us,
down on your knees for Warwick

32:04.684 --> 32:07.924
when you thought that he would
make you king. Richard.

32:09.084 --> 32:12.122
You would rather your dear wife
saw her father carved up,

32:12.124 --> 32:15.002
sent on a tour of England? No.

32:15.004 --> 32:16.164
Obviously.

32:17.324 --> 32:19.882
We are here to honour one
of the finest warriors

32:19.884 --> 32:21.642
this country has ever known.

32:21.644 --> 32:25.124
He fought with our father
and we would be nothing without him.

32:26.564 --> 32:28.722
He may have only been
an in-law to you,

32:28.724 --> 32:30.522
but he was like a brother to us.

32:30.524 --> 32:34.562
We must remember him
for the hero he was

32:34.564 --> 32:36.602
and not the traitor he became.

32:36.604 --> 32:38.202
And we are not savages.

32:38.204 --> 32:41.162
We were just the ones who put him to
the sword - a touch excessively, no?

32:41.164 --> 32:42.402
Remember where you are.

32:42.404 --> 32:45.442
We have won this battle,
but we have yet to win the war.

32:45.444 --> 32:47.124
And I cannot have this!

32:52.884 --> 32:55.204
George is loyal to your husband,
it seems.

32:57.164 --> 32:58.404
Today.

33:01.084 --> 33:02.724
We may have to forgive him...

33:04.844 --> 33:06.444
leave our vengeance to God.

33:09.204 --> 33:10.284
Never.

33:45.244 --> 33:46.562
Leave us.

33:46.564 --> 33:48.244
I have to go again, tonight.

33:50.204 --> 33:52.404
You hope to capture
Margaret of Anjou?

33:53.724 --> 33:57.244
She is riding west to join forces
with Jasper Tudor.

34:00.444 --> 34:02.724
Just do whatever it takes
to end this.

34:04.164 --> 34:06.842
If one battle can bring peace
to England, peace of mind,

34:06.844 --> 34:08.364
it's one worth fighting.

34:10.844 --> 34:12.643
And you will be back in no time.

34:15.284 --> 34:18.083
You have more faith in me
than I ever had in myself.

34:19.204 --> 34:23.844
I remember meeting a fairly
confident boy under an oak tree,

34:27.764 --> 34:30.641
Anthony will guard you in the Tower.

34:30.643 --> 34:32.004
Keep you out of danger.

34:35.043 --> 34:37.404
And who will keep YOU out of danger?

34:38.884 --> 34:41.242
Elizabeth, if something
were to happen... Don't.

34:41.244 --> 34:43.722
There's a man in Flanders
who will take you in,

34:43.724 --> 34:45.802
your mother knows where to meet him.

34:45.804 --> 34:49.364
You must hide for a while till
the little one is older...

34:51.164 --> 34:52.884
and he will take the throne.

34:55.364 --> 34:59.204
You've said all of this before
and you came back to me then.

35:05.124 --> 35:07.764
You will die in my bed.

35:36.404 --> 35:39.442
This is what it is to be
Queen militant -

35:39.444 --> 35:42.642
you have to fight for what you own.

35:42.644 --> 35:45.122
Remember these odds, this pain,

35:45.124 --> 35:50.122
for if we win, you will never
have to march again.

35:50.124 --> 35:53.562
Don't you ever tire
of living like this?

35:53.564 --> 35:57.602
Never. This is what I live for.

35:57.604 --> 35:59.242
Even if it means you're hated?

35:59.244 --> 36:01.162
I've never been liked.

36:01.164 --> 36:03.882
I'm damned twice
in most men's eyes -

36:03.884 --> 36:07.882
I'm the woman who dared to rule
when her husband could not

36:07.884 --> 36:10.962
and who fought to ensure
her only son's position.

36:10.964 --> 36:14.322
Now, how could I do such a thing?

36:14.324 --> 36:15.684
Men!

36:17.564 --> 36:19.642
Why "damned twice"?

36:19.644 --> 36:22.124
Because I'm French, of course!

36:29.684 --> 36:31.004
Tewkesbury!

36:33.164 --> 36:35.522
Once we cross the river,

36:35.524 --> 36:40.002
we are midway to victory.

36:40.004 --> 36:43.482
We will join Jasper Tudor's forces,

36:43.484 --> 36:48.122
return to England
and hunt Edward down!

36:48.124 --> 36:51.724
May God grant us victory!

36:55.324 --> 36:57.762
Your Grace. Yes. The river...

36:57.764 --> 36:59.562
it's too high from this rain...

36:59.564 --> 37:03.802
And we will all die in the morning
if we are caught this side

37:03.804 --> 37:06.202
Edward is closing fast.

37:06.204 --> 37:07.844
This was your idea.

37:10.484 --> 37:15.162
We have no option other than
to camp and cross at first light.

37:15.164 --> 37:19.362
You cannot stay here.
You must take refuge in the abbey.

37:19.364 --> 37:22.682
Camp here,
then take up the best positions

37:22.684 --> 37:26.122
and get your men into battle lines.

37:26.124 --> 37:28.002
Now?

37:28.004 --> 37:31.042
Edward of York has
the speed of the devil,

37:31.044 --> 37:33.882
he prepares in darkness,
and conquers in mist.

37:33.884 --> 37:37.922
You must use every advantage
and be ready,

37:37.924 --> 37:40.884
be ready to fight for your lives!

37:46.684 --> 37:47.804
Keep him safe.

37:49.724 --> 37:51.204
We will go to the abbey.

37:58.164 --> 37:59.842
Lady Mother!

37:59.844 --> 38:01.362
All be very brave.

38:01.364 --> 38:02.882
Are we being attacked?!

38:02.884 --> 38:05.284
They've come out the River Thames
for now.

38:06.324 --> 38:08.322
Who are?

38:08.324 --> 38:10.042
Lancastrian soldiers.

38:10.044 --> 38:12.522
Trying to rescue old King Henry.
How many?

38:12.524 --> 38:14.402
They have warships. So keep back.

38:30.364 --> 38:32.284
Sister, which way is your chapel?

38:34.564 --> 38:37.482
Light a candle for the living too.

38:37.484 --> 38:42.962
Your fate lies with your husband,
not your dead father.

38:42.964 --> 38:44.924
I will pray for both.

38:46.484 --> 38:48.602
And for me.

38:48.604 --> 38:50.442
Edward is my only son.

38:50.444 --> 38:53.924
Pray God spares him,
for all our sakes.

39:02.084 --> 39:04.362
How are you? The baby is well?

39:04.364 --> 39:06.642
Now that has stopped. And you?

39:06.644 --> 39:10.882
Tired, my ears are ringing,
but we've withstood all they have.

39:10.884 --> 39:12.482
For now?

39:12.484 --> 39:16.242
They've moored their boats,
set up camp not far from here.

39:16.244 --> 39:17.922
We'll come under siege at dawn.

39:17.924 --> 39:19.962
Do we have enough men
to resist them?

39:19.964 --> 39:23.602
The apprentice boys
have been flocking in all night.

39:23.604 --> 39:26.242
So we just wait for our enemies
to recover, and then storm us?!

39:26.244 --> 39:28.882
What do you suggest, sister?
Strike back!

39:28.884 --> 39:32.282
Stopping them from coming
any closer to my family.

39:32.284 --> 39:34.844
Let's attack them
when they least expect it.

39:36.444 --> 39:39.522
Most men would prefer to die
in their sleep, would they not?

39:39.524 --> 39:43.484
Spoken like a true Yorkist.
We attack before dawn.

40:30.284 --> 40:31.524
Here. Drink this.

40:35.444 --> 40:39.722
Your Grace, The Duke... Duke
of Somerset,

40:39.724 --> 40:42.762
he said to tell you
if I thought the battle lost...

40:42.764 --> 40:45.724
He fled to a church,
but Edward dragged him out.

40:50.364 --> 40:53.722
And my son? The Prince of Wales?

40:53.724 --> 40:55.644
I must fetch Your Graces' horses.

41:04.124 --> 41:07.202
Get a cape, a blanket and bread.

41:07.204 --> 41:11.122
I'll meet you by the stables.
Shouldn't we wait for Prince Edward?

41:11.124 --> 41:13.482
Just be ready to leave, will you?

41:13.484 --> 41:15.842
This is not the first time
I've fled a battlefield

41:15.844 --> 41:17.802
and it may not be the last.

41:17.804 --> 41:19.762
No!

41:19.764 --> 41:24.162
I'm tired, running and doing
what you say, I'm so tired.

41:24.164 --> 41:26.922
Look at me. Look at me, Anne!

41:26.924 --> 41:28.922
They will be here any moment

41:28.924 --> 41:33.604
and men with blood on their hands
are no respecters of title or age.

41:35.324 --> 41:38.644
We must go. And we must go now.

41:42.764 --> 41:44.682
When I open the gate, ride hard.

41:44.684 --> 41:47.844
Don't look to the battle, don't look
back, just get away from here.

42:01.084 --> 42:02.244
No!

42:03.684 --> 42:05.082
Don't touch me!

42:05.084 --> 42:07.402
No, no, no!

42:07.404 --> 42:09.642
Get off! Don't touch me!

42:09.644 --> 42:12.204
No! No! No!

42:18.484 --> 42:22.084
I am Anne Neville!
I am the Kingmaker's daughter!

42:25.124 --> 42:26.164
No!

42:34.004 --> 42:35.044
Lady Anne?

42:39.764 --> 42:40.804
Princess.

42:42.484 --> 42:44.004
I am Princess Anne.

42:49.244 --> 42:50.684
Dowager Princess.

42:54.684 --> 42:56.004
My husband is dead?

42:58.804 --> 43:00.004
Are you hurt?

43:01.004 --> 43:02.604
It's over. You are safe now.

43:05.884 --> 43:08.002
His mother...

43:08.004 --> 43:09.444
I must tell her.

43:10.724 --> 43:13.804
I've been charged by the King
to take you into his care.

43:17.164 --> 43:19.284
His Grace, the Prince of Wales?

43:21.524 --> 43:22.564
Died...

43:24.404 --> 43:25.922
in battle.

43:25.924 --> 43:28.722
Your commanders have been captured.

43:28.724 --> 43:30.524
I am to take you to London.

43:34.684 --> 43:36.802
I refuse.

43:36.804 --> 43:39.242
I don't have to go anywhere.

43:39.244 --> 43:41.122
I am Queen.

43:41.124 --> 43:43.402
Now, leave us to grieve.

43:43.404 --> 43:45.004
I said leave us!

43:46.404 --> 43:50.082
Get on your horse or I'll have you
bound and gagged

43:50.084 --> 43:52.042
and thrown into a litter.

43:52.044 --> 43:55.524
Be grateful the King wants to show
you as a part of his triumph.

43:57.524 --> 43:59.044
You are bold...

44:00.284 --> 44:02.044
you're a fine soldier...

44:04.004 --> 44:06.764
but you're nothing
while your brother lives.

44:08.204 --> 44:10.642
Come to me, get me out of here

44:10.644 --> 44:12.444
and I will name you as my heir.

44:14.364 --> 44:16.804
I will make you King of England.

44:19.284 --> 44:20.764
You can even have her.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.444
No.

44:32.924 --> 44:35.004
I am not yours to give now.

45:15.164 --> 45:16.764
My boy.

45:17.964 --> 45:19.884
My boy.

45:57.724 --> 46:03.722
Jasper plans to take Henry into
exile again, as you predicted.

46:03.724 --> 46:05.164
Oh...

46:06.484 --> 46:08.884
I hoped, for you,
it wouldn't come to that.

46:13.564 --> 46:15.082
What of Jasper?

46:15.084 --> 46:19.842
He's safe, he didn't reach the
Queen.

46:19.844 --> 46:21.684
He worries for my son.

46:23.044 --> 46:24.562
Now Edward has seized power,

46:24.564 --> 46:27.444
what's to stop him
killing all his enemies at once?

46:28.764 --> 46:32.684
I would see him and his witch burn
for what they have done to my

46:39.324 --> 46:41.444
Let me to go to Tenby to see them.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.522
No. No, I can't.

46:46.524 --> 46:48.244
I have to say goodbye to my boy.

46:52.364 --> 46:53.724
I know the risks...

46:56.164 --> 46:58.564
but I don't know
when I'll see Henry again.

47:03.604 --> 47:04.724
Thank you.

47:10.604 --> 47:12.244
Thank you.

47:13.764 --> 47:15.562
Thank you.

47:15.564 --> 47:16.764
You're a good man.

47:37.644 --> 47:40.844
My son is the most precious thing
in my life.

47:41.844 --> 47:44.404
You are the only man
I trust to look after him.

47:47.604 --> 47:50.522
We fought hard to try
and get to Margaret's army.

47:50.524 --> 47:57.442
I lost men, good men,
trying to cross,

47:57.444 --> 48:01.004
and then watched a massacre,
unable to...

48:03.404 --> 48:04.882
I failed my Queen.

48:04.884 --> 48:06.562
No, No. You tried.

48:06.564 --> 48:08.002
God knows you tried.

48:08.004 --> 48:11.444
Don't talk to me of God, for He was
not at Tewkesbury that day.

48:14.524 --> 48:15.804
Forgive me...

48:18.644 --> 48:21.082
And now, here we are again,

48:21.084 --> 48:24.324
running for our lives,
not knowing when we might return.

48:25.884 --> 48:29.682
You are safe. My son is safe

48:29.684 --> 48:33.162
and we are closer to God's will.

48:33.164 --> 48:36.802
Prince Edward's death puts us
nearer the throne.

48:36.804 --> 48:38.044
Yes.

48:40.244 --> 48:41.764
Please God you're right.

48:47.404 --> 48:49.562
Look after your uncle.

48:49.564 --> 48:52.284
You have him, he has nobody.

48:55.444 --> 48:56.922
I will.

48:56.924 --> 48:59.324
God bless you and keep you.

49:01.284 --> 49:04.684
We may be beaten,
but that is now. Things change.

49:06.564 --> 49:08.044
Never give up.

49:10.564 --> 49:11.884
I won't.

49:17.204 --> 49:21.602
Forget the Bad Queen,
she does not deserve your sympathy.

49:21.604 --> 49:23.484
You remember what we called her?

49:25.484 --> 49:26.802
What will happen?

49:26.804 --> 49:30.322
Spend the rest of her days in the
Tower, I imagine, like her husband.

49:30.324 --> 49:31.644
Is that my fate too?

49:36.644 --> 49:38.084
I hope not.

49:40.124 --> 49:41.882
Am I not a traitor?

49:41.884 --> 49:43.522
I married your enemy.

49:43.524 --> 49:45.964
I'm sure you only did
what you were told.

49:50.124 --> 49:51.324
Anne?

49:53.084 --> 49:57.762
When we landed here,
I had a choice.

49:57.764 --> 49:59.962
I could've gone to my mother,
but I didn't.

49:59.964 --> 50:01.884
I chose to stay with the Bad Queen.

50:03.804 --> 50:05.484
You chose to fight on.

50:06.964 --> 50:09.004
You are your father's daughter.

50:13.884 --> 50:15.284
Do you love me, Anne?

50:17.204 --> 50:18.244
What?

50:20.244 --> 50:22.884
Do you love me... and the King?

50:26.604 --> 50:28.724
Let's hope that's enough for Edward.

50:30.444 --> 50:33.442
I'll take you to your sister
when the court returns to London.

50:33.444 --> 50:34.644
Really?

50:36.924 --> 50:39.964
I would like to see Isabel,
very, very much.

50:47.924 --> 50:49.364
Daddy!

51:45.644 --> 51:47.764
I've sent a messenger
for the priest.

52:12.084 --> 52:13.922
Henry?

52:13.924 --> 52:15.324
Glad you're home.

52:17.484 --> 52:18.524
Here.

52:31.044 --> 52:32.084
No.

52:40.444 --> 52:42.564
Your boy, Henry, safely away?

52:45.724 --> 52:48.084
You must apply for his return later.

52:50.044 --> 52:52.604
They will not refuse
when they hear about me.

52:56.124 --> 52:58.204
I know you never wanted to marry.

53:00.324 --> 53:02.044
And I've disappointed you...

53:07.124 --> 53:09.164
not suited to the times,
I suppose.

53:14.004 --> 53:16.284
Stop fighting to be Margaret Regina.

53:19.324 --> 53:21.562
Just be Margaret

53:21.564 --> 53:23.284
or Sister Margaret.

53:27.324 --> 53:29.004
Do whatever makes you happy.

53:34.044 --> 53:35.484
Perhaps you will pick up?

53:38.844 --> 53:42.004
Bless you. And your son.

53:44.164 --> 53:47.962
I wish we could have had our own,

53:47.964 --> 53:49.724
but I am no less fond of him.

53:51.924 --> 53:53.164
A fine young man.

54:04.124 --> 54:07.282
Make peace with the Yorks.

54:07.284 --> 54:09.084
And bring him home safe.

54:12.964 --> 54:14.724
For peace, Margaret...

54:53.084 --> 54:54.644
Girls, girls.
