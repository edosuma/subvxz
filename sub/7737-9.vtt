- We have intel

00:08.876 --> 00:09.977
that a VIP is coming
into the block

00:10.010 --> 00:11.045
from some big meeting--

00:11.079 --> 00:12.480
someone way bigger
than Snyder.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.315
- The guy that had a gun
on you in the Yonk?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.749
There's a decent chance

00:15.783 --> 00:17.851
that you've at least
seen his face.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.753
- You've been looking
for a leak in your department.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.255
- Who is this?

00:21.289 --> 00:23.391
- Someone who knows the source
is your wife.

00:23.424 --> 00:24.992
- Redhats.
Redhats!

00:25.025 --> 00:25.993
- It's blown.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.561
Go, go, Rachel, go!

00:27.595 --> 00:29.297
[screaming and gunshots]
- Let's go, guys!

00:31.031 --> 00:32.833
- Opportunity
will come again,

00:32.866 --> 00:35.669
and when it does,
I want you there with me.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.405
This is why we fight.

[police sirens approach]

and return to your homes.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.461

02:07.495 --> 02:10.964
You have 60 seconds
to disperse.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.834
- Return to your homes!
- I said move!

02:13.867 --> 02:16.069
- Everyone back up and go home!

02:16.103 --> 02:18.772
This is an unauthorized
gathering.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.341
- Get off the street.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.675
- Don't point
that thing at me, man.

02:21.709 --> 02:22.910
- Look, back up.

02:22.943 --> 02:23.911
- Traitor!

02:23.944 --> 02:25.913
- Ugh!

02:25.946 --> 02:29.217

Hey, Jae, hey!

02:32.286 --> 02:35.456
- Get back!
Back up!

Papa!

03:10.924 --> 03:12.893
[sighs]

03:12.926 --> 03:15.996
- I heard there was
an even bigger riot in K-town.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.102
- I was at work
when they came...

03:22.135 --> 03:24.938
the other side
of the city.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.074
Katie was at the bar.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.277
- Back it up, back it up.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.746
- Fought my way across town,
but it took me hours.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.784
Radio chatter was flying

03:36.817 --> 03:41.422
about guys in the Bureau
being taken out--disappearing.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.957
So I knew I couldn't
go back to my house

03:43.991 --> 03:46.960
'cause someone from the invasion
might be waiting for me there.

[ominous music]

03:50.197 --> 03:51.799
*

03:51.832 --> 03:53.467
- The mob stayed quiet
longer than I thought,

03:53.501 --> 03:56.003
but the wheels
are spinning now.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.940
This whole damn place
is going to hell.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.743
- We were waiting
for opportunity to knock.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.479
Well, here it is.

04:05.513 --> 04:10.017
- You think this is enough
to sell Snyder on our story?

04:10.050 --> 04:11.485
- I think after this,

04:11.519 --> 04:14.755
he'll eat it
right out of our hands.

04:14.788 --> 04:18.759
[ominous music]

04:18.792 --> 04:20.193
- I specifically tripled

04:20.227 --> 04:21.662
last night's
Homeland Security detail

04:21.695 --> 04:22.896
to avoid this.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.332
What the hell happened?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.566
- There were a lot of people
on the street

04:25.599 --> 04:27.200
before curfew last night,

04:27.234 --> 04:30.237
mostly in peaceful recognition
of the anniversary.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.439
There was some looting,

04:31.472 --> 04:32.773
a few protests
that turned violent,

04:32.806 --> 04:34.508
but most of the violence
appears to have been

04:34.542 --> 04:36.710
spontaneous and random.
- Most, but not all.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.045
- There were
four or five incidents

04:38.078 --> 04:40.213
that may have been
coordinated.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.916
- Proxy, can we talk to you
in private?

04:42.950 --> 04:45.386
[background chatter]
[phones ringing]

04:53.093 --> 04:55.262
- Why all the secrecy?
[clears throat]

04:55.363 --> 04:57.731
- We think a new cell
might have set up operations

04:57.765 --> 04:59.867
outside the colony.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.669
- That's not possible.

05:01.702 --> 05:05.038
- We have a reliable C.I.
that says it is.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.708
His cousin signed up
with someone

05:07.741 --> 05:09.610
offering cash and weapons
to anyone willing

05:09.643 --> 05:11.845
to fight the Occupation
in the L.A. bloc.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.381
He said
he went to meet a guy

05:13.414 --> 05:15.616
at the old Commerce
building downtown.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.385
- Downtown?

05:17.385 --> 05:19.953
How would they
get in and out?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.523
- Maybe someone found a way
under the wall

05:22.556 --> 05:25.292
that the RAPs never sealed.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.694
- What's important here

05:26.727 --> 05:28.396
is it looks like
someone's invested in

05:28.396 --> 05:29.797
making you look bad.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.499
- The scarier attacks
from last night

05:31.532 --> 05:32.966
were all well-orchestrated,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.703
but then everyone vanished
without a trace.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.838
- It's like when the Taliban
was hiding out in Pakistan.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.640
Nobody had the balls
to cross the border

05:39.673 --> 05:41.409
and go after them.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.412
Everyone looked the other way,
so they had safe haven.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.648
- Let's say for a moment

05:47.681 --> 05:50.317
that I was interested
in exploring this.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.720
- Let us take a run
through the wall into downtown,

05:52.753 --> 05:54.054
check it out.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.759
- All right.
Do it.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.430
Lagarza's unit
will come with you.

06:02.463 --> 06:06.333
I can't send my two star
investigators out there alone.

06:06.434 --> 06:09.336
[dramatic music]

06:09.437 --> 06:17.445

06:22.282 --> 06:24.685
- The natives are restless.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.887
- So am I.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.191
I've been leaving you
messages for a week.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.194
Why haven't you
answered me?

06:37.898 --> 06:41.034
- My mother died
the night of the Arrival.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.370
She'd had
a bad heart for years.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.706
Shock did her in.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.476
I was angry, too,

06:48.509 --> 06:50.811
but if I'd acted
on pure emotion,

06:50.844 --> 06:53.146
I'd be dead now.

06:55.082 --> 06:59.520
- Are you accusing me
of being too emotional?

06:59.553 --> 07:03.491
They hanged our friend
and her sons from a bridge.

07:03.491 --> 07:07.528
- I was giving you the space
to deal with your anger

07:07.561 --> 07:09.697
so you could process it

07:09.730 --> 07:12.232
and then...get past it.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.502
- I don't want
to get past it.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.804
You've chosen
to bury your emotions--

07:16.837 --> 07:18.405
that's fine.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.642
I don't have to be like you
to do this job.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.778

07:57.811 --> 08:01.982
this painting
my husband and I bought...

08:02.015 --> 08:03.884
before all this.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.820
It was confiscated
after the Arrival.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.723
[scoffs, sniffles]

08:09.757 --> 08:13.360
I hated Nagle...
[chuckles]

08:13.393 --> 08:16.564
but Rob loved him.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.266
We were at
an auction, and...

08:19.299 --> 08:21.902
he just started bidding.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.170
[laughs]

08:23.203 --> 08:24.772
He hung it
in the living room,

08:24.805 --> 08:27.575
and I had to see that thing
every day.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.379
- And you came around
to like it.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.347
[tearful laugh]

08:34.381 --> 08:38.451
- Yeah.
Oh, sorry.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.623
- Maddie.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.126
I need your help
in here.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.236
- The gallery showing
went late last night,

08:56.269 --> 08:58.238
and I didn't have
the kitchen staff

08:58.271 --> 08:59.607
to cover it.

09:02.910 --> 09:06.513
- You want me
to clean your kitchen?

09:06.614 --> 09:08.381
- Is that a problem?

09:08.415 --> 09:09.783
I'll just call
down to staffing

09:09.817 --> 09:12.886
and have them send
someone else up.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.856
- No, no, it's fine.
I'm happy to take care of it.

after all this time,

09:44.952 --> 09:46.319
all we had to do was ask.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.520
- Priority clearance.

09:47.554 --> 09:48.889
- Don't jinx this.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.157
There's still
a lot of road ahead.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.192

10:32.232 --> 10:34.201

10:34.234 --> 10:36.336

the Chief Minister

10:36.369 --> 10:39.239
is coming to L.A. for some
state of the union thing?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.341
- Yeah, I heard about that.
- Thursday.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.876
- Uh-huh.
- They didn't invite you?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.644
- No.

It's above my pay-grade,

There's some proposal

that's gone to
Helena's office

10:51.351 --> 10:56.023
to take over the bloc
with a "new direction"?

10:56.056 --> 10:58.325
You've heard nothing
about this proposal.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.492
No one approached you?

10:59.526 --> 11:02.963
- Mm-mm, no.
Nobody, nothing.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.464

hard to believe.

No one in the Green Zone
makes a bowel movement

- Alan, I-I promise, this is
the first I heard of this.

- Don't forget who gave you
that cozy office of yours.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.111
I want a copy
of that proposal.

11:18.145 --> 11:21.181

but Alan...

11:21.214 --> 11:23.016

We've got a protocol
for a reason.

Open the door.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.635

You know Eckhart.

This is Katie.

your partner?

- What's your, uh,
combat experience?

of running my own business.

cautious man you've ever met,

with my life.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.138
So can you.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.144
So here's the rundown.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.913
Our friends here got intel
on a V.I.P.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.982
coming into the bloc
from outside the colony,

13:02.015 --> 13:04.017
someone major
in regional leadership.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.386
- They use the metro line
to bring certain V.I.P.s

13:06.419 --> 13:07.855
in and out of the colony.

- Hey, Nolan, how you doing?
- Uh, all right.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.994
- Gallery's in here, right?
- Yeah.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.796
- Yes, sir.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.231
- I truly admire the work
your wife is doing, by the way.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.167
The collection
is really growing.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.302
Hit the private office first.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.904
I want to see all the art
they've been keeping in there.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.572
- Sir.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.741
- You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

26:48.775 --> 26:50.910
- In this world,
loyalty and trust

26:50.943 --> 26:53.279
are such critical qualities.
- Hey, what are you doing?

26:53.312 --> 26:54.681
Don't touch those.
- Back away, please, ma'am.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.850
- What I need to know is
how far can I trust you?

26:57.884 --> 26:59.485
- Please, ma'am,
stay out of our way.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.420
- What are you doing
in my house?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.856
- Oh, we're admiring
your collection.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.528
[whistles]

27:09.561 --> 27:11.263
I don't need
an art history degree

27:11.297 --> 27:14.867
to know that that's
a really expensive painting.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.736
- There are more
in the office, sir.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.705
- I had no idea
that was here.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.440
- This is the sort of thing
that should be

27:21.473 --> 27:23.575
up with our Hosts,
isn't it?

27:23.609 --> 27:26.412
- Yes, of course.
Of course it is.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.082
- There, her.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.851
She's the one
that brought it to me.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.953
She the one
that you want.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.287
Talk to her.

27:35.321 --> 27:39.558
[dramatic music]

27:39.591 --> 27:40.860
- Who are you?

27:40.893 --> 27:43.095
- I'm just an assistant.

27:43.129 --> 27:51.303
*

27:51.337 --> 27:53.239
- This way, please, ma'am.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.107
- No. What are you doing?
- Come with me.

27:55.141 --> 27:56.608
- This is my house!
- I think...

27:56.642 --> 27:57.744
- Get your hands
off of me.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.211
- I think that we have

27:59.245 --> 28:01.981
a certain level of trust,
so I'll believe you

28:02.014 --> 28:03.850
if you tell me that
this was your wife's mistake

28:03.883 --> 28:05.484
and not yours.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.987
- I knew nothing about this.
- Do something, Nolan!

28:08.020 --> 28:09.756
- I didn't think so.

28:09.756 --> 28:10.990
- Nolan!

28:11.023 --> 28:12.391
- Let's go!

28:12.424 --> 28:13.960
- You bitch!

28:13.993 --> 28:17.830
- Okay, ma'am.
[plastic handcuffs squeak]

28:17.864 --> 28:19.365

off of me.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.646
- You going camping?

29:10.149 --> 29:13.085
- Just taking inventory.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.454
It's good to be ready.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.323
- Yes, it is.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.863
Bram, I have to
go out tonight.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.331
- To the Yonk?

29:25.364 --> 29:27.633
- I got Johnnie to cover.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.837
- Where are you going?

29:30.870 --> 29:33.940
- I have to do something
for the family.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.307
- What?

29:37.877 --> 29:40.346
I want to know
what's going on.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.052
No, of course,
that would involve

29:46.085 --> 29:48.154
actually explaining
something to me.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.624
- I will tell you everything--
I promise you.

29:52.658 --> 29:54.360
I can't do it now.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.162
I need you to
watch Gracie tonight.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.497
- I have plans.
- Break them.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.699
- I always have to watch her.
I'm not her parent.

30:00.732 --> 30:01.700
You and Dad are.

30:01.868 --> 30:02.869
You do it.
- Bram.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.104
Look at me.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.913
This is important.

30:18.951 --> 30:23.890
If there's an emergency,
you can call me on that number,

30:23.923 --> 30:26.492
but this is just between
you and me.

30:26.525 --> 30:30.096
Do you understand me?

30:30.129 --> 30:32.731
- Yeah.
Okay.

30:49.015 --> 30:49.281
.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.683
- Hey, bear.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.087
- Are you mad at Bram?

30:55.121 --> 30:56.822
- No, we just had
a disagreement.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.991
- About Charlie?

30:59.025 --> 31:00.459
- Charlie? No.

31:00.492 --> 31:03.729
- Because
he's going to be okay.

31:03.762 --> 31:06.365
- I know he is.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.601
- All the kids are.

31:09.635 --> 31:13.439
We're their favorites.
They need us.

31:13.472 --> 31:14.573
- Who?

31:17.409 --> 31:19.711
What are you reading?

31:19.745 --> 31:22.048
- Nothing.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.016
- Grace Kathryn.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.585
- I can't tell you.

- Let me see.

Mom, please.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.249
- Mom, give it back.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.451
Give me back my book, Mom!

31:59.485 --> 32:01.220
- Hey.
- Mom, this is mine!

32:01.253 --> 32:03.155
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Give it back.

32:03.189 --> 32:04.690
- I would like you to go
up to your room right now

32:04.723 --> 32:06.392
and compose yourself.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.994
Excuse me, go.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.899
- What happened?

32:14.000 --> 32:17.503
- That's what Lindsey's
been teaching your sister.

32:17.536 --> 32:18.604
[door slams]

32:22.841 --> 32:25.011
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.015
Don't ever believe anybody
who tells you that

32:29.048 --> 32:31.283
what we're dealing with here
is benign.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.765
[beeping]

32:51.770 --> 32:53.339
- Hey.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.041
What's wrong?

32:55.041 --> 32:57.776
- Lindsey--
you know what she's been doing?

32:57.809 --> 33:00.512
You know what they've been
teaching our daughter?

33:00.546 --> 33:02.081
Indoctrination.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.615
Right here
in our house,

33:03.649 --> 33:05.117
and both of us
too blind to see it.

33:05.151 --> 33:08.820
Our daughter
is worshipping the RAPs.

33:08.854 --> 33:10.889
Do you not care?
- Yes, I care.

33:12.358 --> 33:15.061
But we don't have
to worry about that anymore.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.099
We're leaving the colony.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.600
- What?

33:21.633 --> 33:24.303
- You, Maddie, and the kids
are gonna go with Beau.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.704
He's got a cabin
up in Big Bear.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.840
It's stocked,
off the grid, safe.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.976
- When were you gonna tell me
about this plan?

33:31.077 --> 33:32.978
- I'm telling you now.
The window is now.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.347
- And when we're up
in Big Bear with Beau,

33:35.381 --> 33:38.350
where will you be?

33:38.384 --> 33:42.621
- I'm gonna go and get Charlie
and meet you there.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.390
- [exhales]

33:44.423 --> 33:45.991
[laughs]

33:46.092 --> 33:50.196
- This is funny?
- No, Will, it's crazy.

33:53.232 --> 33:58.504
- When I came into the Yonk,
you said that you would do this.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.139
- I thought
we were just talking.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.274
I didn't realize
that you were serious.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.410
- I'm the only one
that's been serious

34:04.443 --> 34:06.245
about protecting
this family.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.314
- How can you say that?

34:13.018 --> 34:15.987
- [sighs]

34:16.021 --> 34:18.257
How long you been
spying on me?

34:20.526 --> 34:22.128
Lying to me?

34:22.161 --> 34:25.331
Selling me out
to those killers you work for?

34:25.364 --> 34:26.932
- I did it
to protect you.

34:26.965 --> 34:29.135
- Bullshit!
You did it for you.

34:29.168 --> 34:32.171
You did it because you can never
accept things the way they are.

34:32.204 --> 34:36.342
- No, I did it because someone
has to do something.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.909
You know
what's going on out there?

34:37.943 --> 34:39.778
Someone has to say "enough."

34:39.811 --> 34:42.581
- I should have shut you down
the minute I found out

34:42.614 --> 34:44.516
what you were doing.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.153
Instead, I'm running around town
trying to clean up after you.

34:47.153 --> 34:48.520
- Thanks--
don't need your help.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.289
- You'd be dead
if it wasn't for me.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.591
- So would you.

34:52.624 --> 34:53.959
- Like Phyllis?

34:53.992 --> 34:55.527
- You mean the person
whose job it was

34:55.561 --> 34:59.665
to hunt down and destroy
anyone brave enough to stand up?

34:59.698 --> 35:02.968
- [scoffs]
That how you justify it?

35:05.237 --> 35:08.174
I showed you
what Broussard did,

35:08.207 --> 35:10.542
and you stayed
with him anyway.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.212
- I don't have to justify
anything to you.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.946
- Oh.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.348
- You watched
my friend Rachel

35:16.382 --> 35:19.385
get shot in the street
like a dog.

35:19.418 --> 35:22.854
And then they hung her
and her sons from a bridge.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.856
They were babies, Will.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.058
- You think
I don't know that?

35:27.092 --> 35:28.760
That is on you.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.797
What you are doing put a noose
around those babies' necks.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.266
Maybe you should think
about our kids.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.969
- I am doing this
for our kids!

35:38.003 --> 35:40.572
You don't care
what I think.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.208
You just show up here
with a plan

35:42.208 --> 35:44.042
expect me
to follow orders.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.045
That's not a partnership, Will,
and it's not a marriage.

35:47.078 --> 35:51.817
- Don't you tell me
what a marriage is.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.553
I was straight up with you,
and you lied to my face.

35:54.586 --> 35:57.923
- You lied to me
when you went after Charlie.

35:57.956 --> 36:01.660
What would have happened
if you hadn't come home?

36:01.693 --> 36:04.363
We would never have known
what happened to you.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.401
Will, I hate myself for this.
I hate myself every day.

36:09.435 --> 36:10.836
I hate what it's done to us.

36:10.869 --> 36:14.139
I hate what it's done
to our family.

36:14.240 --> 36:18.043
But I know you hate
the Authority as much as I do.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.411
You could fight with us.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.247
We have something new--
something big.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.749
We're gonna finally get a look
inside the Occupation

36:23.782 --> 36:25.251
and see what it is
that we're facing.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.253
We could fight together

36:27.253 --> 36:30.155
so that our kids don't
grow up in this.

36:30.256 --> 36:34.493
[dramatic music]

36:34.526 --> 36:38.063
- And you thought
my plan was crazy.

36:38.096 --> 36:41.567
*

36:41.600 --> 36:46.272
You need to get the kids
and go with Beau.

36:46.272 --> 36:48.840
- And do what?
Hide?

36:48.874 --> 36:50.842
There's no hiding
from them, Will,

36:50.876 --> 36:52.278
not even outside the Walls.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.280
How would we survive?

36:57.283 --> 36:59.818
- Please, Katie.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.493
- I'm sorry.
I can't.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.761
I can't.
I can't.

37:21.407 --> 37:21.640

37:21.673 --> 37:24.075
- The proposal
we spoke about.

37:28.113 --> 37:31.550
- Gill. No surprise.
Newman, Voight, Rosenburg--

37:31.583 --> 37:33.452
Son of a bitch.

37:36.322 --> 37:37.723
[sighs]

37:37.756 --> 37:39.024
There's gonna be
a fight ahead of us

37:39.057 --> 37:41.226
if we're gonna keep
our jobs.

37:41.327 --> 37:43.562
- Then
let's sharpen our knives.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.684
- What happened?
Where's Katie?

38:05.717 --> 38:07.586
- She's not coming.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.059
- Okay, no biggie.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.695
We'll wait for another
opportunity to come along.

38:16.728 --> 38:20.031
- There won't be
another opportunity.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.533
We got the go-ahead
from Snyder.

38:21.567 --> 38:24.169
The tunnel's still open.
You should use it.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.840
I don't know
what's gonna happen here, but...

38:28.874 --> 38:32.378
I don't want you
taking the hit for it.

38:32.378 --> 38:34.279
Get out while you can.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.451
- [scoffs]

Doesn't matter what a man has
if he doesn't have purpose.

You take
that away from him...

38:49.928 --> 38:51.897
man usually goes
with it.

I never thought
I'd find mine again.
