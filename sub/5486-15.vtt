WEBVTT

00:02.409 --> 00:04.669
[all cheering]

00:06.469 --> 00:09.409
- So, I've never been set up
by my Postmates before,

00:09.409 --> 00:11.679
but it makes sense because I see
Carlos F. almost every night.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.479
- Yeah, Carlos is cool.

00:13.479 --> 00:16.449
- Hey, man,
the show is down here.

00:16.449 --> 00:17.609
- Right, right.

00:17.609 --> 00:19.539
So Carlos
mentioned that you--

00:19.539 --> 00:21.509
[crowd cheers]
Yes!

00:21.509 --> 00:22.659
And one!
- I'm gonna go.

00:22.659 --> 00:24.629
If I wanted to be treated badly
at a wings place,

00:24.629 --> 00:26.659
I'd go by the one by my house
where I don't tip.

00:26.659 --> 00:28.569
- W--

00:28.569 --> 00:30.000
Well, wait,
I-I-I'm sorry.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.519
Well, wait,
I-I-I'm sorry.

00:31.519 --> 00:33.489
Truth is, I haven't been
on a date in a while.

00:33.489 --> 00:35.629
I'm a bit rusty,
and right now,

00:35.629 --> 00:39.469
we are in the middle of
a category five Sportz-icane.

00:39.469 --> 00:40.589
- What's a Sportz-icane?

00:40.589 --> 00:43.419
- It's a day when a bunch
of great sporting events

00:43.419 --> 00:44.479
happen at the same time,

00:44.479 --> 00:47.439
and we've got a game seven
in the NHL,

00:47.439 --> 00:48.489
Lebron versus Kobe,

00:48.489 --> 00:51.489
and the biggest MMA fight
of all time,

00:51.489 --> 00:53.529
Soto Diaz
versus Diaz Soto.

00:53.529 --> 00:55.519
- I actually kind of like MMA.

00:55.519 --> 00:58.539
I think it's cute
when those guys 69 each other.

00:58.539 --> 01:00.000
- Here. Come over here
and sit on my side.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.549
- Here. Come over here
and sit on my side.

01:00.549 --> 01:02.609
I'll explain everything,
and, uh,

01:02.609 --> 01:04.509
I'll be so busy
yammering away

01:04.509 --> 01:05.599
that you can have
all the wings.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.479
- Okay.
Okay.

01:07.479 --> 01:09.519
<i>[elevator bell dings]</i>
<i>Oh, that was very interesting.</i>

01:09.519 --> 01:11.439
I did not know that
they held sporting events

01:11.439 --> 01:12.609
at Madison Square Garden.

01:12.609 --> 01:15.639
I thought that's just
where Billy Joel lived, so...

01:15.639 --> 01:17.569
Um, well, this is me.

01:17.569 --> 01:20.579
You know, it started off bad,
but I had a really nice time.

01:20.579 --> 01:21.679
- I had
a really nice time too.

01:21.679 --> 01:23.429
It was fun, right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:23.429 --> 01:24.489
- I mean, even though
you choked on a wing

01:24.489 --> 01:25.599
and I had to give you
the Heimlich maneuver.

01:25.599 --> 01:26.649
- Yeah, sorry about that.

01:26.649 --> 01:28.449
I'm just such a foodie.

01:28.449 --> 01:29.669
- No, I liked it.

01:29.669 --> 01:30.000
I mean, I got to cop a feel
on the first date, you know?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.439
I mean, I got to cop a feel
on the first date, you know?

01:32.439 --> 01:33.479
[both chuckle]

01:39.539 --> 01:40.649
- [exhales]

01:40.649 --> 01:44.389
Well, I have delivered you
safely to your apartment.

01:44.389 --> 01:47.409
I'm not gonna make it weird
and ask to come in.

01:47.409 --> 01:49.429
- You can come in.
I'd love for you to come in.

01:49.429 --> 01:50.549
- [chuckles]

01:50.549 --> 01:52.479
Easy, tiger.

01:52.479 --> 01:55.439
Maybe I've earned myself
a nighttime date?

01:55.439 --> 01:56.539
- Definitely.

01:56.539 --> 01:57.549
- [whispers]
Well...

01:59.529 --> 02:00.000
- Morgan,
I had the best date.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.419
- Morgan,
I had the best date.

02:02.419 --> 02:05.439
He's cute,
he made sports tolerable,

02:05.439 --> 02:08.439
he paid for three figures' worth
of chicken wings.

02:08.439 --> 02:09.509
- See, I told you,

02:09.509 --> 02:11.449
it's not impossible to date
as a single mother.

02:11.449 --> 02:13.419
- Oh, my God,
I'm a mom.

02:13.419 --> 02:14.579
I didn't tell him
I have a kid.

02:14.579 --> 02:16.389
- Did you tell him
about me?

02:16.389 --> 02:18.599
- No, of course not.

02:18.599 --> 02:20.609
Okay. Don't cry.

02:20.609 --> 02:22.679
Come on, that's not--
[both crying]

02:22.679 --> 02:24.519
Don't encourage him.

02:24.519 --> 02:28.559
<i>[hip-hop music]</i>

02:32.399 --> 02:33.399
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>

02:33.399 --> 02:34.429
How do I tell a man
that I am dating

02:34.429 --> 02:35.439
that I have a kid?

02:35.439 --> 02:36.609
- How many children
does he have?

02:36.609 --> 02:38.519
- None.
- Well, then it doesn't matter

02:38.519 --> 02:39.629
how you tell him,
because it's over.

02:39.629 --> 02:40.679
- What?
- I don't know.

02:40.679 --> 02:42.639
I think I would date a woman
with a child.

02:42.639 --> 02:43.639
- Thank you.

02:43.639 --> 02:45.679
- A female child, though.
- What?

02:45.679 --> 02:47.579
- Well, if it was a boy, it
would only be a matter of time

02:47.579 --> 02:49.559
before he was big enough
to kill me.

02:49.559 --> 02:52.469
- Yeah, I could totally see
a little boy killing Dr. Reed.

02:52.469 --> 02:53.639
- Right?
- Yeah, for sure.

02:53.639 --> 02:55.639
- Oh, my God, you guys don't
know what you're talking about.

02:55.639 --> 02:56.639
Kurt Russell
got with Goldie Hawn

02:56.639 --> 02:58.419
when she had two kids.

02:58.419 --> 02:59.429
- Well, with all due respect,

02:59.429 --> 02:59.900
Mindy is no Goldie Hawn
in "Overboard."

02:59.900 --> 03:00.609
Mindy is no Goldie Hawn
in "Overboard."

03:00.609 --> 03:01.639
- How dare you?

03:01.639 --> 03:04.409
I have fallen off
of several ships.

03:04.409 --> 03:05.669
- Hey, man,
you're out of line.

03:05.669 --> 03:08.589
Yeah, this one has a child,
all right?

03:08.589 --> 03:11.469
But, maybe there's something
wrong with this guy.

03:11.469 --> 03:14.659
He could be ugly or deformed
or have a scarred penis.

03:14.659 --> 03:16.599
- No, stop. I thought
you were going to say

03:16.599 --> 03:18.589
that it didn't matter because
Leo's such a great kid

03:18.589 --> 03:22.389
and anyone would be lucky
to be around him.

03:22.389 --> 03:23.489
- Leo's okay.

03:23.489 --> 03:25.599
- All right, that sucked.
- Honest. Just honest.

03:25.599 --> 03:28.559
Colette, you need to get
your ass in there and fix this.

03:28.559 --> 03:29.900
I am all in.
If you bail on me, I'm ruined.

03:29.900 --> 03:30.479
I am all in.
If you bail on me, I'm ruined.

03:30.479 --> 03:32.409
[both muttering]
- Hey!

03:32.409 --> 03:33.479
What the hell's going on
in here?

03:33.479 --> 03:34.679
Beverly's trying
to sleep out there.

03:34.679 --> 03:36.569
- Sorry.
- Okay, okay, listen.

03:36.569 --> 03:39.409
Colette and I have decided
to move in together,

03:39.409 --> 03:41.519
and now this one is bailing.

03:41.519 --> 03:44.409
- I know, I just--I have
a hard time telling my brother

03:44.409 --> 03:45.549
that I got to move out

03:45.549 --> 03:47.539
'cause he's really
protective of me.

03:47.539 --> 03:48.659
- Okay, okay,
I'm sorry.

03:48.659 --> 03:50.589
I didn't realize that
you were gonna have to have

03:50.589 --> 03:52.409
a difficult conversation
with your bother.

03:52.409 --> 03:53.499
- Thank you.
- I'm so sorry.

03:53.499 --> 03:55.599
I mean, 'cause I went
to see my grandmother,

03:55.599 --> 03:59.429
the woman who saw me through
prison and my soda addiction,

03:59.429 --> 03:59.900
and I told her
I'm out of here, yo, bitch.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.419
and I told her
I'm out of here, yo, bitch.

04:02.419 --> 04:03.539
- Why would you do that?

04:03.539 --> 04:05.409
- 'Cause I was hopped up
on Sprite

04:05.409 --> 04:06.529
'cause I'm using again.

04:06.529 --> 04:07.649
- Hey, Colette.
- Yes.

04:07.649 --> 04:10.439
- Forget Jody.
Where do you want to live?

04:10.439 --> 04:12.529
- With Morgan.
With all my heart.

04:12.529 --> 04:15.479
He's my friend, and we wear
the same Croc size.

04:15.479 --> 04:17.539
- Okay, I was trying
to give you a way out,

04:17.539 --> 04:19.419
but if that's really
how you feel,

04:19.419 --> 04:22.419
and again, I find that
very hard to believe,

04:22.419 --> 04:23.659
then you need to talk
to your brother.

04:23.659 --> 04:25.629
- [sighs]
You're right.

04:25.629 --> 04:28.529
<i>- Hey, I need to talk to you</i>
<i>about something.</i>

04:28.529 --> 04:29.900
I have a kid, and I know that
it's a deal-breaker,

04:29.900 --> 04:32.419
I have a kid, and I know that
it's a deal-breaker,

04:32.419 --> 04:34.429
so I'm just gonna
take my food

04:34.429 --> 04:36.429
and eat in the ladies' room
on the toilet.

04:36.429 --> 04:37.599
- [scoffs]
Whoa, hold--hold on, hold on.

04:37.599 --> 04:39.489
Wait, wait, wait.
Can we maybe sit down?

04:39.489 --> 04:41.509
We've got, like,
30 more plates of tapas coming.

04:41.509 --> 04:42.659
- I--
- Please?

04:42.659 --> 04:44.389
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:44.389 --> 04:45.659
- All right.

04:45.659 --> 04:47.489
- Guess what?

04:47.489 --> 04:49.539
I like kids.
- Really?

04:49.539 --> 04:51.409
- Look,
we're both in our 30s,

04:51.409 --> 04:52.659
we have our histories.

04:52.659 --> 04:55.399
I mean, I was...

04:55.399 --> 04:56.539
engaged once.

04:56.539 --> 04:57.659
Didn't work out.

04:57.659 --> 04:59.609
- My God,
I was engaged too.

04:59.609 --> 04:59.900
That's where
my kid is from.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.399
That's where
my kid is from.

05:01.399 --> 05:03.429
It's actually kind of
a sexy story.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.389
We were in the alley
next to a Dumpster

05:05.389 --> 05:07.499
behind the Bubba Gump
just kind of going at it.

05:07.499 --> 05:09.509
- Cool, yeah,
do you maybe have any stories

05:09.509 --> 05:11.439
that don't involve you
having unprotected sex

05:11.439 --> 05:12.489
with another man?

05:12.489 --> 05:13.559
- Yes.

05:13.559 --> 05:15.599
Once, I got a turtleneck
caught over my head

05:15.599 --> 05:16.679
in a changing room,

05:16.679 --> 05:18.619
and, uh, they had to call
the fire department.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.479
Made national news.
- Wow.

05:20.479 --> 05:21.559
- [giggles]

05:23.499 --> 05:24.579
Good morning, co-workers.

05:24.579 --> 05:26.599
- Look out. Here she comes.
Everybody be nice.

05:26.599 --> 05:28.589
She just got dumped.
- Uh, would a guy

05:28.589 --> 05:29.900
who's dumping me give me
five minutes of tongue

05:29.900 --> 05:31.449
who's dumping me give me
five minutes of tongue

05:31.449 --> 05:32.639
last night?
- Whoa, what?

05:32.639 --> 05:34.679
He knows you have a son
and he's still interested?

05:34.679 --> 05:37.469
By God,
hold on to him, Mindy.

05:37.469 --> 05:39.419
Like a flagpole
in a tornado.

05:39.419 --> 05:41.389
- Guys, check this out.

05:41.389 --> 05:43.409
He's taking me to a wedding
this weekend.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.409
- A wedding?
On your third date?

05:45.409 --> 05:47.499
No, that's too fast.
No, he'll see how you dance.

05:47.499 --> 05:48.609
How you eat shrimp.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.619
[snarling]

05:50.619 --> 05:52.469
Oh, God,
this thing's over.

05:52.469 --> 05:54.469
- Oh, my God,
what is everyone's problem?

05:54.469 --> 05:55.529
You worry
he doesn't like her,

05:55.529 --> 05:56.649
now you're worried
he likes her too much?

05:56.649 --> 05:58.589
You should just not care,
like me.

05:58.589 --> 05:59.900
- Thank you, Tamra.
Thank you.

05:59.900 --> 06:00.559
- Thank you, Tamra.
Thank you.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.429
- Jody, you know
I'm grateful for everything

06:04.429 --> 06:06.649
that you've done for me,
and I love you.

06:06.649 --> 06:08.459
- Well,
I love you too, Colette.

06:08.459 --> 06:10.619
That's why I'm so happy
that we live together.

06:10.619 --> 06:12.589
- Ah, yeah, uh...

06:12.589 --> 06:15.399
but aren't we lucky
that we get to

06:15.399 --> 06:17.419
work together, too, right?
- Yes.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.579
- So even if we didn't
live together,

06:20.579 --> 06:23.499
we'd still see each other,
like, all the time.

06:23.499 --> 06:26.399
- Well, I don't really
consider this you-and-me time,

06:26.399 --> 06:28.659
but I'm okay with that,
because we live together.

06:28.659 --> 06:29.900
- I'm moving out.

06:29.900 --> 06:30.619
- I'm moving out.

06:30.619 --> 06:32.659
Yeah, Morgan and I
are gonna be roommates.

06:32.659 --> 06:33.679
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

06:33.679 --> 06:35.499
- But, why?

06:35.499 --> 06:39.489
- I just want to try being
more independent, you know?

06:39.489 --> 06:41.679
- All right,
I guess--I guess that's that.

06:41.679 --> 06:44.649
- So...you're okay
with this?

06:44.649 --> 06:46.619
- Well, it doesn't
really matter.

06:46.619 --> 06:48.659
Once a Kimball-Kinney's
made up their mind,

06:48.659 --> 06:50.659
that horse
is as good as glue.

06:50.659 --> 06:53.429
- Thank you.
Thank you, bro.

06:53.429 --> 06:54.449
I love you.

06:54.449 --> 06:55.649
- Oh, I--I love you,
too.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.569
- Best brother ever.
- Oh, best sister...

06:57.569 --> 06:59.459
- Best brother ever!

06:59.459 --> 06:59.900
You!
- A man could wish for.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.559
You!
- A man could wish for.

07:01.559 --> 07:04.629
Morgan, would you come
to my office, please?

07:05.669 --> 07:07.409
- Hey.

07:07.409 --> 07:08.579
- I understand that
you and my sister

07:08.579 --> 07:10.419
are going to be
living together.

07:10.419 --> 07:11.479
- Okay, she told you.

07:11.479 --> 07:12.569
- Yes.

07:12.569 --> 07:15.569

14:11.579 --> 14:14.459
- We don't have an appointment.
Just an incredible opportunity.

14:14.459 --> 14:16.389
It's a line
of nude underwear.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.389
- [ahem] I'm sorry.
She's very busy.

14:18.389 --> 14:20.389
- Of course, yeah.
- [whispers] T-t-t-t...

14:20.389 --> 14:21.639
Nude underwear
for women of color.

14:21.639 --> 14:23.569
- Oh.

14:23.569 --> 14:25.519
One moment, please.

14:25.519 --> 14:26.679
- Okay, so right now
the industry standard

14:26.679 --> 14:28.449
for flesh-colored underwear

14:28.449 --> 14:30.459
is somewhere between
Kate and Rooney Mara.

14:30.459 --> 14:31.636
It's like every morning
when I wake up,

14:31.636 --> 14:31.639
It's like every morning
when I wake up,

14:31.639 --> 14:34.419
my underwear drawer
is telling me I'm not important.

14:34.419 --> 14:35.639
- That is the most empowering
underwear pitch

14:35.639 --> 14:36.639
I've heard today.

14:36.639 --> 14:38.499
I'd love to invest.

14:38.499 --> 14:40.429
- Well, we need to know
a little bit more about you.

14:40.429 --> 14:42.659
- Well, we're a mid-level firm
with investments ranging--

14:42.659 --> 14:44.399
- Not so much
about your firm.

14:44.399 --> 14:45.669
More about
your personal life.

14:45.669 --> 14:47.499
Have you ever been engaged?

14:47.499 --> 14:48.569
What was the guy like?

14:48.569 --> 14:49.649
Who ended it,
you or him?

14:49.649 --> 14:52.589
- Wait, I know you
from somewhere.

14:52.589 --> 14:53.649
Have you ever
cleaned my house?

14:53.649 --> 14:54.649
- What's that, bitch?

14:54.649 --> 14:58.559
- Oh, wait.

14:58.559 --> 14:59.559
You're dating Bryant.

14:59.559 --> 15:01.499
- Oh, my God,
that's me.

15:01.499 --> 15:01.636
I had fallen asleep
during "Spotlight."

15:01.636 --> 15:03.389
I had fallen asleep
during "Spotlight."

15:03.389 --> 15:05.459
I hope those nosy journalists
got what they deserved.

15:05.459 --> 15:07.499
"Dear Tess, I'm sorry
that my last voicemail

15:07.499 --> 15:09.489
was so frantic and long."

15:09.489 --> 15:10.679
<i>Bryant:</i>
<i>I'm doing much better now.</i>

15:10.679 --> 15:13.469
<i>I actually met somebody.</i>
<i>I hope seeing me</i>

15:13.469 --> 15:15.509

15:15.509 --> 15:16.609
<i>about your decision</i>
<i>to end things.</i>

15:16.609 --> 15:18.569
[camera clicks]
Mindy and Bryant: Love, Bryant.

15:18.569 --> 15:21.409
- Oh, shit!

15:25.569 --> 15:27.649
- Okay, I feel that
I have been misrepresented.

15:27.649 --> 15:30.409
Bryant and I have only been
on three dates.

15:30.409 --> 15:32.419
- I'm beginning to think this
isn't about venture capital.

15:32.419 --> 15:33.449
- No, no, no, no, no.

15:33.449 --> 15:35.429
This is all a part
of our vetting process.

15:35.429 --> 15:37.549
So, what happened
between you and Bryant?

15:37.549 --> 15:39.559
- Well, we started dating
freshman year.

15:39.559 --> 15:41.389
When he proposed,
I said yes,

15:41.389 --> 15:43.409
and then I realized he was
the only person I'd ever dated,

15:43.409 --> 15:45.429
and I wanted to see
what else was out there, so...

15:45.429 --> 15:46.549
I broke up with him.

15:46.549 --> 15:48.629
- Oh, so now Bryant's
trying to prove to everyone

15:48.629 --> 15:49.649
that he's moved on,

15:49.649 --> 15:51.489
so he'll just date
any old thing.

15:51.489 --> 15:52.539
- Okay.

15:52.539 --> 15:52.880
I thought that Bryant
liked me for me.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.419
I thought that Bryant
liked me for me.

15:55.419 --> 15:57.549
Not just because I was
a souped-up version of his ex,

15:57.549 --> 15:59.409
no offense.

15:59.409 --> 16:00.409
I got to go talk to him.

16:00.409 --> 16:01.489
Come on, Tamra.
Let's go.

16:01.489 --> 16:03.569
Take the waters.

16:03.569 --> 16:05.419
<i>- Try some carrots.</i>

16:05.419 --> 16:06.459
Dug them out of the earth
this morning.

16:06.459 --> 16:07.469
Go nuts.

16:07.469 --> 16:08.569
- I never thrown
a party before,

16:08.569 --> 16:10.589
but I think this party
is awesome.

16:10.589 --> 16:11.609
- I think it stinks!

16:11.609 --> 16:13.489
The eighth grade jazz band
you hired,

16:13.489 --> 16:14.569
they play two songs.

16:14.569 --> 16:16.389
Okay, I can't hear
"The Pink Panther" again.

16:16.389 --> 16:17.549
Talk to them, please.
[doorbell rings]

16:17.549 --> 16:19.419
- All right...well, they have
a lot of pizzazz.

16:19.419 --> 16:20.479
- Okay, well,
I can't hear that song again.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.569
It's making me crazy.

16:21.569 --> 16:22.649
Hello, everybody.

16:22.649 --> 16:22.880
Hi, how are you?

16:22.880 --> 16:24.639
Hi, how are you?

16:26.439 --> 16:28.479
- Hi!
- That's what you're wearing?

16:28.479 --> 16:30.489
- Okay, I don't need this.
- Oh, oh, no, no, no, no.

16:30.489 --> 16:34.579
So sorry...
[murmurs]

16:34.579 --> 16:36.489
It's supposed to be
like a classy party.

16:36.489 --> 16:38.459
Like, I'm wearing--I'm wearing
a matching vest and pants.

16:38.459 --> 16:39.549
- It's not that great.

16:39.549 --> 16:41.429
- Well, it's better
than what Dr. Reed's wearing

16:41.429 --> 16:42.609
which is like
straight-up gym clothes.

16:42.609 --> 16:45.669
- Morgan.
Your apartment's really nice.

16:45.669 --> 16:48.499
Not a million dogs everywhere.
I don't see any garbage.

16:48.499 --> 16:50.489
- Aw, thanks.
The dogs are in their room.

16:50.489 --> 16:52.389
They're watching, uh,
"Beethoven's 2nd,"

16:52.389 --> 16:52.880
starring Charles Grodin.

16:52.880 --> 16:53.429
starring Charles Grodin.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.549
- Dr. L,
we need to talk.

16:54.549 --> 16:56.459
Your boyfriend
was the first person here

16:56.459 --> 16:59.419
and immediately
broke a chip in the salsa.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.589
Didn't even fish it out.

17:00.589 --> 17:02.459
- Wait, he came?
- Mm-hmm.

17:02.459 --> 17:03.569
- To this?
- Yeah.

17:03.569 --> 17:05.459
- Yeah, at, like, 4:00.

17:05.459 --> 17:06.599
We were still
in our bathrobe.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.489
- Oh, my God.

17:08.489 --> 17:12.469
- There's my girl.
I love your friends.

17:12.469 --> 17:14.599
Jeremy and I made plans
to go for a walk

17:14.599 --> 17:16.519
when the weather gets nice.

17:16.519 --> 17:18.449
- Uh, okay, this is weird.
I have to talk to you.

17:18.449 --> 17:19.599
Come on, let's go.
- What?

17:19.599 --> 17:20.679
- Come in here.

17:20.679 --> 17:22.539
Oh, for God sakes.

17:22.539 --> 17:22.880
Okay.

17:22.880 --> 17:23.669
Okay.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.419
- [whines]

17:25.419 --> 17:26.649
Sit down.
Excuse me, pop off.

17:26.649 --> 17:28.509
Hey, hey.
- What?

17:28.509 --> 17:29.659
- Why are you here?

17:29.659 --> 17:32.529
- Um, because
it's my girlfriend's

17:32.529 --> 17:34.499
co-worker's
housewarming party?

17:34.499 --> 17:35.539
I'm not gonna
miss that.

17:35.539 --> 17:37.479
- No. Listen,
I know that you were engaged

17:37.479 --> 17:39.399
two months ago.
I met Theresa.

17:39.399 --> 17:41.519
- You met...
Tess.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.629
How's she doing?

17:42.629 --> 17:45.549
She looked awfully sunburned
in those Instagram photos

17:45.549 --> 17:47.449
from her girls' trip
to Cancun.

17:47.449 --> 17:48.529
- Okay, her tan
was obviously perfect,

17:48.529 --> 17:50.399
like ooh-la-la.

17:50.399 --> 17:52.609
I think you still
have feelings for her.

17:52.609 --> 17:52.880
- No, I don't.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.489
- No, I don't.

17:54.489 --> 17:56.669
I'm...
totally over her.

17:56.669 --> 17:59.439
I just--I just follow her
on social media

17:59.439 --> 18:01.509
to see what a loser
she's turned into.

18:01.509 --> 18:02.539
- Okay.
Listen.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.479
Bryant, nothing would
make me happier

18:05.479 --> 18:08.409
than if a successful,
handsome guy like you

18:08.409 --> 18:09.629
were actually
interested in me.

18:09.629 --> 18:11.389
But you're not.

18:11.389 --> 18:13.619
I think you are still
in love with your ex.

18:13.619 --> 18:14.669
And listen,
I've been there,

18:14.669 --> 18:15.679
but fast-tracking
our relationship

18:15.679 --> 18:17.459
is not gonna help you.

18:17.459 --> 18:20.659
- How am I supposed to find
someone as good as Tess?

18:20.659 --> 18:22.880
What if settling for you
is my best shot?

18:22.880 --> 18:23.509
What if settling for you
is my best shot?

18:23.509 --> 18:25.599
- Okay, we're both nines,
so I take issue with your logic.

18:25.599 --> 18:27.449
But I'm not gonna sit here

18:27.449 --> 18:29.389
and help some good-looking guy
in their 30s

18:29.389 --> 18:31.459
lament their dating prospects
in New York City.

18:31.459 --> 18:32.679
- I'm actually
about to turn 30.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.649
- Okay, how dare you?

18:34.649 --> 18:37.439
How dare you be
in your late 20s?

18:37.439 --> 18:40.499
Meanwhile, I'm 35 with a kid
and a bad personality.

18:40.499 --> 18:42.609
I'm never
gonna date again.

18:42.609 --> 18:45.649
Okay.
I guess you should go.

18:45.649 --> 18:47.529
- Okay.

18:47.529 --> 18:52.389
<i>[gentle music]</i>

18:52.389 --> 18:52.880
Bye.

18:52.880 --> 18:53.629
Bye.

18:53.629 --> 18:56.489
[all dogs barking]

18:56.489 --> 18:57.649
- I'll say,
a lot of people thought

18:57.649 --> 18:59.419
this wasn't
going to be possible.

18:59.419 --> 19:00.509
But we did it.
- We did it--

19:00.509 --> 19:02.519
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

19:02.519 --> 19:04.589
- Aaaaaah!
[commotion]

19:04.589 --> 19:07.409
- Cinnamon has ringworm.
Don't touch Cinnamon!

19:07.409 --> 19:08.669
- Keep playing--this is not what
you're being paid for.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.409
- [screams]

19:10.409 --> 19:11.589

19:11.589 --> 19:14.399
- None of the dogs
have their shots.

19:14.399 --> 19:16.429
- Keep that adorable bastard
away from me.

19:17.629 --> 19:18.679
- Oh! Hey, everybody.
- Hey...

19:18.679 --> 19:20.539
- My brother's here.

19:20.539 --> 19:22.880
So whoever's sitting
in the good chair, get up.

19:22.880 --> 19:23.459
So whoever's sitting
in the good chair, get up.

19:23.459 --> 19:24.459
What's up, bro?

19:24.459 --> 19:25.579
Uhh!
- Oh...

19:25.579 --> 19:27.519
Listen, I wanted to thank you
for your patience with me

19:27.519 --> 19:29.669
as I adjust
to this new situation.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.559
Change is difficult for me.

19:31.559 --> 19:33.389
- Well, I appreciate it,

19:33.389 --> 19:35.539
and you're welcome here
any time, bro.

19:35.539 --> 19:38.579
We can have a sleepover
and prank call girls we like.

19:38.579 --> 19:40.489
- Well, I don't know that
we need to sleep over,

19:40.489 --> 19:43.429
as I have rented
a place upstairs.

19:43.429 --> 19:44.589
- What?

19:44.589 --> 19:46.649
- Yes, last night,
as I was taking soup

19:46.649 --> 19:49.409
in the second dining room
alone,

19:49.409 --> 19:51.479
I realized this is
too much space for one man.

19:51.479 --> 19:52.639
- No freaking way!

19:52.639 --> 19:52.880
[dogs barking]
- Colette, language.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.549
[dogs barking]
- Colette, language.

19:54.549 --> 19:56.429
This is just
what I was worried about.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.509
- I'm fine.

19:57.509 --> 19:59.629
You're the one with the problem,
you know that?

19:59.629 --> 20:02.419
We shouldn't be living together
at our age.

20:02.419 --> 20:05.409
You know that "Grey Gardens"
runs in our family.

20:05.409 --> 20:07.429
Honestly, I think that
you use living with me

20:07.429 --> 20:10.459
as an excuse to avoid
a real adult relationship.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.589
And take your stupid wine.

20:11.589 --> 20:13.539
I don't know
how to open it.

20:13.539 --> 20:16.409
- [hoarsely]
Colette!

20:16.409 --> 20:17.439
Hmm.

20:20.489 --> 20:22.439
- [whispers]
Guys, go in that direction.

20:22.439 --> 20:22.880
- All right, guys,
do me a favor.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.629
- All right, guys,
do me a favor.

20:23.629 --> 20:26.599
Something up-tempo and fun.
One, two, three, four.

20:26.599 --> 20:28.449
["The Pink Panther Theme"]

20:28.449 --> 20:29.539
Not that.

20:29.539 --> 20:31.399
- Mm.

20:31.399 --> 20:32.569
Thank you so much
for the ice cream.

20:32.569 --> 20:33.649
- Oh, don't worry about it.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.529
I--I understand
you love your hot fudge.

20:35.529 --> 20:37.419
- Mm-hmm.

20:37.419 --> 20:38.619
- Listen, about
what Colette said earlier,

20:38.619 --> 20:40.549
I am not scared
to live alone

20:40.549 --> 20:41.649
because I am not alone.

20:41.649 --> 20:44.479
I--I have a stuffed owl
in my study.

20:44.479 --> 20:45.529
Thank you.

20:45.529 --> 20:48.669
And Murgatroyd and I
will be fine, so...

20:48.669 --> 20:49.679
- Okay.
Totally.

20:49.679 --> 20:52.419
I believe you, Jody.

20:52.419 --> 20:52.880
Actually, it'd be kind of
easier to bring home women

20:52.880 --> 20:55.399
Actually, it'd be kind of
easier to bring home women

20:55.399 --> 20:57.399
now that you're not
living with your sister.

20:57.399 --> 20:58.429
- I beg your pardon?

20:58.429 --> 21:00.499
- You know, now you can be
as loud as you want.

21:00.499 --> 21:02.409
You know,
when you're having sex.

21:02.409 --> 21:04.589
You can be like,
"Oh! Waitress I just met!

21:04.589 --> 21:06.559
"Oh! I'm close!
Hit me, hit me.

21:06.559 --> 21:08.399
I'm coming
'round the mountain."

21:08.399 --> 21:09.449
- Stop.
Stop it.

21:09.449 --> 21:11.399
This is my neighborhood.

21:11.399 --> 21:13.449
Jessica Seinfeld
lives right there.

21:13.449 --> 21:14.639
- Jerry Seinfeld
lives there?

21:14.639 --> 21:15.639
- Yeah, well...

21:15.639 --> 21:17.499
- No soup for you!

21:17.499 --> 21:19.429
- Please.
I beg you.

21:19.429 --> 21:21.449
I beg you.
Please stop.

21:21.449 --> 21:22.880
I don't know how
Bryant puts up with you.

21:22.880 --> 21:23.509
I don't know how
Bryant puts up with you.

21:25.529 --> 21:27.559
- He actually doesn't
put up with me anymore.

21:27.559 --> 21:28.659
We broke up.

21:28.659 --> 21:30.449
- I'm sorry to hear that.

21:30.449 --> 21:31.589
- It's fine.

21:31.589 --> 21:33.439
I'm just starting
to feel like

21:33.439 --> 21:35.609
the only way a normal guy
would be interested in me

21:35.609 --> 21:37.499
is if he were crazy.

21:37.499 --> 21:40.469
- No, no, Mindy,
that is not true.

21:40.469 --> 21:41.569
Yes, you dress
like the Hamburglar.

21:41.569 --> 21:44.459
Yes, you eat burgers
like the Hamburglar.

21:44.459 --> 21:47.519
But I'm not worried about you,
Mindy Lahiri.

21:47.519 --> 21:49.609
You'll be just fine.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.880
Well, this is my house.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.419
Well, this is my house.

21:53.419 --> 21:54.679
- This is where you live?
- Yeah.

21:54.679 --> 21:57.399
- I thought this was
the Iraqi Embassy.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.429
This whole building?

21:58.429 --> 21:59.559
- Just the third floor.

21:59.559 --> 22:01.459
The sundeck is communal.

22:01.459 --> 22:03.399
But A-Rod
is always out there.

22:03.399 --> 22:04.629
- What the hell
is wrong with Colette?

22:04.629 --> 22:06.489
I wanna live there.

22:06.489 --> 22:08.449
- Well, you want
to spend the night?

22:09.649 --> 22:12.459
In a guest bedroom,
of course.

22:12.459 --> 22:13.669
There are eight of them.

22:13.669 --> 22:16.439
- You have eight bedrooms?

22:16.439 --> 22:19.479
God, you can do
whatever you want to me.
