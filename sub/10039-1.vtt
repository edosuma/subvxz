WEBVTT

07:47.383 --> 07:49.634
Watch the birdie!

13:37.066 --> 13:41.402
Come on, have something to drink
with us. Come on, drink with us.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.155
Drink it, drink it...

30:33.206 --> 30:35.457
Do you want gold?

30:39.254 --> 30:40.420
Yes.

34:44.332 --> 34:49.586
You are excrement.
You can change yourself into gold.

35:27.708 --> 35:32.838
You broke the looking glass.
Now break the stone.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.029
Each stone has a soul,

35:58.072 --> 36:02.200
formed by the work of millions of years.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.748
The tarot will teach you
how to create a soul.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.361
To know.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.293
To dare.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.182
To want.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.148
To be silent.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.366
The same force the vulture
uses to seize the ox

38:48.451 --> 38:52.454
is needed by the ox
to receive the vulture.

39:34.455 --> 39:39.876
The fish thinks about his hunger,
not about the fisherman.

39:42.797 --> 39:46.341
It is the master
who seeks the disciple.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.555
You want to know the secret,

39:52.640 --> 39:56.059
but man can achieve nothing
by himself.

39:56.143 --> 40:00.438
To accomplish the alchemical work,
you will have these companions.

40:00.523 --> 40:03.900
They are thieves like you,
but on another level.

40:03.984 --> 40:07.278
They are the most powerful people
on the planet.

40:07.363 --> 40:11.116
Industrialists and politicians.

40:11.200 --> 40:16.037
My name is Fon, my planet is Venus.

40:17.123 --> 40:21.835
My business is devoted to the comfort
and beauty of the human body -

40:21.919 --> 40:26.673
beds, mattresses, fabrics,

40:26.757 --> 40:29.843
clothing, cosmetics.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.695
My father is the creator of this empire.

40:48.821 --> 40:53.116
He is deaf, dumb and blind.

40:55.369 --> 40:58.621
Before making a decision,
he consults with my mother's mummy.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.957
He puts his hand into her sex.

41:01.041 --> 41:05.587
If it's moist, it's yes.
If it's dry, it's no.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.552
These are my wives.

41:12.678 --> 41:15.722
I make love to them
only during working hours.

41:15.806 --> 41:20.602
They begin as workers,
then I promote them to secretaries.

43:21.181 --> 43:23.766
We know that people want to be loved,

43:23.851 --> 43:28.021
not for who they are
but for what they appear to be.

43:28.147 --> 43:30.982
So we have created a line of masks,

43:31.066 --> 43:35.570
that have the texture,
warmth, and smell,

43:35.696 --> 43:38.781
of living human beings.

43:38.866 --> 43:42.869
A customer can have any face
she wants.

43:42.995 --> 43:47.415
Every face is unique
and lasts a lifetime.

43:47.541 --> 43:50.835
She can wear her artificial face
to the grave.

43:51.962 --> 43:56.049
Our make-up department for corpses
eliminates the appearance of death.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.134
Not only do we beautify cadavers,

43:58.218 --> 44:01.763
we also equip them
with electronic devices.

44:01.889 --> 44:04.724
They can kiss their family goodbye...

44:11.732 --> 44:14.567
...participate in their own last rites...

44:20.324 --> 44:22.200
...or give a live show.

44:35.464 --> 44:39.300
My name is Isla, my planet is Mars.

46:17.191 --> 46:20.777
Every morning I wake up
my male secretaries.

46:29.870 --> 46:33.122
I manufacture and sell weapons.

46:36.126 --> 46:39.712
We produce bombers,
hydrogen bombs,

46:39.838 --> 46:43.007
ray guns, deadly bacteria,

46:43.091 --> 46:49.263
anti-matter waves,
carcinogenic gases, etcetera.

47:01.735 --> 47:06.197
We are experimenting with a drug
to create delusions of grandeur.

47:08.367 --> 47:11.661
Another drug turns harmless people
into wild beasts.

47:28.846 --> 47:33.057
The young generation needs arms
for its marches and sit-ins.

47:43.777 --> 47:47.029
We have psychedelic shotguns...

47:48.782 --> 47:50.700
...grenade necklaces...

47:51.785 --> 47:53.995
...rock and roll weapons...

47:55.455 --> 47:57.498
...mystical weapons for Buddhists...

47:58.333 --> 47:59.750
...Jews...

48:01.503 --> 48:03.462
...and Christians.

48:08.260 --> 48:12.722
My name is Klen,
my planet is Jupiter.

48:12.806 --> 48:14.807
My house.

48:20.814 --> 48:22.815
My wife.

49:13.742 --> 49:15.201
My chauffeur.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.554
- My lover.
- Hi!

49:35.681 --> 49:37.682
A thousand a week.

50:34.573 --> 50:36.574
My art factory.

50:41.955 --> 50:45.458
We produce a new line of art
every season.

51:48.313 --> 51:50.856
We created a love machine.

51:50.899 --> 51:54.360
To make it live the spectator
has to work with it, guide it,

51:54.486 --> 51:57.988
receive it,
give himself in the act of love.

51:58.073 --> 52:02.868
With this electronic rod
he will rub its mechanical vagina.

52:02.953 --> 52:08.040
The spectator's skill will determine
the machine's ability to reach a climax.

52:39.698 --> 52:42.074
My chauffeur is a bad lover.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.201
He didn't know how to satisfy it.

52:44.286 --> 52:47.538
But this woman,
I know her techniques very well,

52:47.622 --> 52:49.874
will produce the electronic orgasm.

52:49.958 --> 52:51.792
Frigid!

54:04.074 --> 54:08.494
My name is Sel, my planet is Saturn.

54:08.578 --> 54:11.455
My customers are children.

56:52.909 --> 56:56.161
We manufacture war toys.

57:19.811 --> 57:23.939
Workers needed in the miniature
plastic bomb shop.

57:39.122 --> 57:41.832
We have an electronic computer

57:41.916 --> 57:45.752
programmed with the politics
of the government.

57:45.879 --> 57:47.963
The government is our client.

57:53.595 --> 57:59.016
We feed the computer data
on coming wars and revolutions.

57:59.100 --> 58:02.227
It tells us what kind of toys to produce

58:02.353 --> 58:04.771
to condition children from birth.

58:07.692 --> 58:13.572
If the government calculates it will be
necessary to wage war against Peru,

58:13.698 --> 58:16.909
our machine studies the Peruvians
and tells us what to do.

58:20.580 --> 58:25.167
We manufacture hyper-sexed
brown native vampires,

58:25.251 --> 58:29.046
who can only be destroyed
by a cross the color of white skin.

58:29.130 --> 58:32.424
We create a laxative
that induces vomiting.

58:32.550 --> 58:37.262
We name it after the capital of Peru
and tint it with the color of the natives.

58:37.388 --> 58:40.682
We started a comic book campaign.

59:04.874 --> 59:07.584
For 15 years in advance,

59:07.669 --> 59:11.505
we condition children
to hate the future enemy.

59:49.836 --> 59:53.755
In 15 years these children
will go off to war,

59:53.840 --> 59:57.092
to kill Peruvians with pleasure.

1:00:01.848 --> 1:00:04.975
My name is Berg,
my planet is Uranus.

1:01:31.604 --> 1:01:34.481
Our window is the wrong size,

1:01:34.607 --> 1:01:36.441
I don't like it.

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:42.614
Berg, why do we have
that enormous hole in the wall?

1:01:42.699 --> 1:01:44.700
Close it up!

1:02:17.024 --> 1:02:20.026
Our little baby is hungry.

1:03:26.552 --> 1:03:30.305
- Have you finished the report?
- No.

1:03:52.203 --> 1:03:55.997
The president wants the report.
Hurry up! Hurry!

1:04:14.475 --> 1:04:17.352
I am financial adviser to the president.

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:41.001
To save the country's economy,

1:04:41.127 --> 1:04:46.131
we must eliminate four million citizens
in the next five years.

1:04:51.137 --> 1:04:54.514
Begin the operations
of the gas chambers.

1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:59.269
Gas schools, gas universities,
gas libraries, gas museums,

1:04:59.353 --> 1:05:02.522
gas dance halls,
and gas whore houses, etcetera.

1:06:08.881 --> 1:06:10.924
I hate you! I hate you!

1:06:16.055 --> 1:06:19.599
My name is Axon, my planet is Neptune.

1:06:19.725 --> 1:06:22.102
I am the chief of police.

1:07:29.378 --> 1:07:32.297
This is the most beautiful day
of your life.

1:07:32.423 --> 1:07:37.552
Of your own free will you came
to surrender part of your body to me.

1:07:37.636 --> 1:07:40.597
You decided to undergo the initiation

1:07:40.681 --> 1:07:46.394
that 999 other heroes have passed.

1:07:55.321 --> 1:08:02.077
Your sacrifice completes my
sanctuary of one thousand testicles.

1:08:15.007 --> 1:08:20.470
This is the holy book.
Learn to believe in me.

1:10:43.948 --> 1:10:48.618
Axon is the truth and the power
and the light...

1:10:54.833 --> 1:10:59.379
My name is Lut, my planet is Pluto.

1:10:59.505 --> 1:11:01.839
My business is architecture.

1:11:14.186 --> 1:11:16.020
Where is he?

1:11:16.105 --> 1:11:19.482
He's there, he's there!

1:11:19.566 --> 1:11:21.401
No, no he's not!

1:11:33.372 --> 1:11:37.083
He's up there. There he is!
He's up there!

1:11:40.379 --> 1:11:43.298
Go get him! Come on, let's go get him!

1:11:44.591 --> 1:11:46.718
Where is he?

1:11:52.266 --> 1:11:54.142
There he is!

1:12:01.525 --> 1:12:05.653
When we built this multi-family complex
we made a big mistake -

1:12:05.738 --> 1:12:07.905
we lost money.

1:12:09.116 --> 1:12:12.410
We gave them small gardens
and windows, we installed water,

1:12:12.494 --> 1:12:14.412
lighting, and heating systems.

1:12:14.538 --> 1:12:17.040
This was a wrong concept.

1:12:18.709 --> 1:12:22.295
A man doesn't need a home,
all he needs is a shelter.

1:12:22.421 --> 1:12:26.674
If we can sell him on the idea
of a shelter, we can make millions.

1:12:47.946 --> 1:12:53.034
A worker will come here only to sleep,
he won't need electricity or water.

1:12:53.118 --> 1:12:57.872
He won't have to cook,
we'll condition him to eat at the factory.

1:12:59.792 --> 1:13:03.169
These are communal latrine trucks
for the entire building.

1:15:44.915 --> 1:15:49.627
You have power and money,
but you are mortal.

1:15:49.711 --> 1:15:52.547
You know you cannot escape death.

1:15:52.631 --> 1:15:55.466
But immortality can be obtained.

1:16:00.806 --> 1:16:04.684
In old traditions they speak
of holy mountains.

1:16:05.561 --> 1:16:07.895
The Meru mountain of India.

1:16:10.816 --> 1:16:13.442
Mount Kunlun of the Taoists.

1:16:15.028 --> 1:16:17.029
The Karakoram of the Himalaya.

1:16:18.490 --> 1:16:20.575
The mountain of the philosophers.

1:16:21.493 --> 1:16:23.786
The Rosicrucian mountain.

1:16:23.870 --> 1:16:27.039
The Cabalistic mountain
of San Juan De La Cruz.

1:16:27.165 --> 1:16:30.334
There are many other holy mountains.

1:16:30.460 --> 1:16:33.337
The legend is always the same.

1:16:33.463 --> 1:16:37.466
Nine lmmortal men live on top
of the mountain.

1:16:37.551 --> 1:16:40.511
From the highest peak
they direct our world.

1:16:40.637 --> 1:16:45.266
They hold the secret
to the conquest of death.

1:16:45.350 --> 1:16:49.604
They are more
than 40,000 years old.

1:16:49.688 --> 1:16:52.523
But they were once like ourselves.

1:16:52.608 --> 1:16:55.860
If others have succeeded
in conquering death,

1:16:55.944 --> 1:16:58.654
why must we accept it?

1:16:58.739 --> 1:17:03.743
I know where the lmmortals live
and how to obtain their secret.

1:17:08.665 --> 1:17:11.709
In this ancient Rosicrucian manuscript,

1:17:11.793 --> 1:17:16.922
I found an etching of the Nine lmmortals
and the place where they live.

1:17:17.049 --> 1:17:20.051
The holy mountain of Lotus Island.

1:17:20.177 --> 1:17:25.681
Some men join forces to assault banks
and steal money, pieces of paper.

1:17:25.766 --> 1:17:31.687
We must unite our forces to assault
the holy mountain,

1:17:31.772 --> 1:17:35.691
and rob its wise men
of their secret of immortality.

1:17:35.776 --> 1:17:38.444
But to conquer the wisdom
of the lmmortals,

1:17:38.570 --> 1:17:40.780
we too must become wise men.

1:17:40.906 --> 1:17:45.951
The elements of chemistry
are many, but finite.

1:17:46.078 --> 1:17:49.580
So are the techniques of enlightenment.

1:17:49.706 --> 1:17:54.502
To reach it more quickly
we will combine the techniques.

1:17:54.586 --> 1:18:00.257
With the correct formula, any human
being can become enlightened.

1:18:02.594 --> 1:18:05.262
The lmmortals are a group.

1:18:06.348 --> 1:18:09.934
If we are to succeed,
we must cease to be individuals,

1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:12.103
and become a collective being.

1:18:31.289 --> 1:18:33.249
Burn your money!

1:19:52.120 --> 1:19:57.041
Thief! If you don't want to die,
kill your money.

1:20:11.389 --> 1:20:14.642
We shall destroy the self image,

1:20:14.726 --> 1:20:18.771
unsteady, wavering, bewildered,

1:20:18.897 --> 1:20:23.317
full of desire, distracted, confused.

1:20:23.401 --> 1:20:29.448
When the self concept thinks,
this is I and that is mine,

1:20:29.574 --> 1:20:34.537
he binds himself
and he forgets the great self.

1:22:55.679 --> 1:22:59.515
- His feet stink like a rotten dog.
- He has beautiful teeth.

1:22:59.599 --> 1:23:02.101
I can't stand the smell.

1:23:22.288 --> 1:23:27.042
When he puts all your bones back
together, you will like his smell.

1:23:37.137 --> 1:23:42.599
Man learned to cultivate the earth
by weakening the plants,

1:23:42.684 --> 1:23:47.438
wild plants remained as they were
at the moment of creation.

1:23:47.522 --> 1:23:50.983
They are the humble
guardians of the secret.

1:24:43.787 --> 1:24:49.083
The flower knows...
you don't need to ask it.

1:26:24.262 --> 1:26:28.098
The dog will take your senses
away with him.

1:26:28.183 --> 1:26:30.475
He can see for you.

1:26:39.569 --> 1:26:44.406
The delicate scent of flowers
is the fragrance of the universe.

1:26:44.490 --> 1:26:49.161
I eat the flower,
and its perfume is my blood.

1:26:49.287 --> 1:26:55.167
Together we form a dog,
in search of the sacred flower.

1:26:56.252 --> 1:27:02.257
Together we form a flower,
in search of the sacred water.

1:27:03.885 --> 1:27:07.846
This is the moment
when the word is made flesh.

1:27:35.458 --> 1:27:38.001
How many people are you?

1:27:38.127 --> 1:27:40.337
One, two, three, four, five...

1:27:41.839 --> 1:27:43.340
We are nine.

1:27:43.424 --> 1:27:46.260
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

1:27:46.344 --> 1:27:49.596
- One is missing.
- Yes.

1:27:59.315 --> 1:28:01.775
Here is the missing one.
He drowned.

1:28:16.749 --> 1:28:18.417
He drowned.

1:29:03.588 --> 1:29:06.590
This is the ceremony of death.

1:29:06.716 --> 1:29:09.885
The grave receives you with love.

1:29:09.969 --> 1:29:12.596
Surrender yourselves to death.

1:29:13.514 --> 1:29:17.100
Return what was loaned to you.

1:29:17.185 --> 1:29:20.687
Give up your pleasure, your pains.

1:29:20.772 --> 1:29:24.149
Give up your friends, your lovers.

1:29:24.275 --> 1:29:28.320
Give up your family, your past.

1:29:28.446 --> 1:29:32.949
Surrender what you hate,
what you desire.

1:29:33.076 --> 1:29:35.577
You will know nothingness -

1:29:35.661 --> 1:29:38.497
it is the only reality.

1:29:38.623 --> 1:29:42.542
Don't be afraid. It's so easy to give.

1:29:42.627 --> 1:29:45.962
You are not alone. You have a grave.

1:29:46.089 --> 1:29:48.548
It is your first mother.

1:29:48.633 --> 1:29:51.968
The grave is the door to your rebirth.

1:29:52.762 --> 1:29:59.059
Now you will surrender the faithful animal
you once called your body.

1:29:59.143 --> 1:30:01.144
Don't try to keep it.

1:30:01.270 --> 1:30:05.065
Remember, it was a loan.

1:30:05.149 --> 1:30:08.610
Surrender your legs, surrender your sex,

1:30:08.694 --> 1:30:14.491
your hair, your blood, your organs,
your bones.

1:30:14.617 --> 1:30:16.827
You no longer want to possess.

1:30:16.911 --> 1:30:19.663
Possession is the ultimate pain.

1:30:19.747 --> 1:30:22.582
The earth falls over your corpse.

1:30:22.667 --> 1:30:25.210
She comes to cover you with love,

1:30:25.336 --> 1:30:28.588
because she is your true flesh.

1:30:28.673 --> 1:30:31.550
Now you are an empty heart,

1:30:31.676 --> 1:30:35.345
open to receive your true essence.

1:30:35.471 --> 1:30:39.349
Your own perfection, your new body,

1:30:39.475 --> 1:30:43.687
which is the universe, the work of God.

1:30:43.771 --> 1:30:47.190
You will be born again,
you will be real,

1:30:47.316 --> 1:30:50.694
you will be your own father,
your own mother,

1:30:50.820 --> 1:30:54.322
your own child, your own perfection.

1:30:54.407 --> 1:30:58.076
Open your eyes. You are the earth,
you are the green,

1:30:58.202 --> 1:31:02.747
you are the blue, you are the Aleph,
you are the essence.

1:31:02.874 --> 1:31:06.626
Look at the flower.
Look at the flower.

1:31:06.711 --> 1:31:11.006
For the first time, look at the flowers.

1:31:11.090 --> 1:31:13.925
Now, you are a group.

1:32:08.814 --> 1:32:12.692
Do you want to perform
miracles like Christ?

1:32:12.777 --> 1:32:15.570
See what would happen if you did.

1:33:34.859 --> 1:33:37.319
Concentrate on this starfish.

1:33:37.403 --> 1:33:43.241
When you see the size of an elephant,
you will never miss the target.

1:33:48.873 --> 1:33:51.374
Our thoughts have forms.

1:33:51.459 --> 1:33:54.711
You have a monster in your mind.

1:33:54.795 --> 1:33:56.880
We will help you.

1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:52.185
Throw the monster into the water.

1:35:11.664 --> 1:35:14.124
He can't swim, he will drown.

1:35:15.459 --> 1:35:18.837
Fool, destroy your illusions.

1:35:19.922 --> 1:35:22.716
Free yourself from the past.

1:35:41.944 --> 1:35:45.864
We have crossed the great waters.

1:36:17.855 --> 1:36:21.649
Congratulations, you made it to our
shores! This deserves a toast!

1:36:21.734 --> 1:36:25.570
You're not the first to come to Lotus
Island in search of the holy mountain.

1:36:32.036 --> 1:36:35.997
I drink alone because newcomers
are always abstainers.

1:36:36.081 --> 1:36:39.209
In time they realize
that the best liquor in the world

1:36:39.335 --> 1:36:41.211
is at the Pantheon Bar.

1:36:42.922 --> 1:36:46.132
Come. Come. Come.
I have everything -

1:36:46.217 --> 1:36:50.261
food, drinks, beds, baths,
men, women.

1:37:25.381 --> 1:37:29.133
These illustrious travelers came here
to find the holy mountain,

1:37:29.260 --> 1:37:32.554
but they preferred The Pantheon Bar!

1:37:36.225 --> 1:37:38.768
The real holy mountain is here -

1:37:38.894 --> 1:37:41.855
in my words, in my poems.

1:37:42.648 --> 1:37:46.860
If I write rose, it blooms in my hand,

1:37:47.611 --> 1:37:51.281
And the bees come
to feed on my poetry.

1:37:55.953 --> 1:37:59.455
Our bees make honey,
but your flies make shit.

1:38:06.255 --> 1:38:10.008
The cross was a mushroom.

1:38:11.886 --> 1:38:17.015
And the mushroom was also
the tree of good and evil.

1:38:18.225 --> 1:38:22.812
The philosophical stone
of the alchemists...

1:38:23.814 --> 1:38:27.400
...was LSD.

1:38:36.327 --> 1:38:40.663
The book of the dead is a trip,

1:38:40.748 --> 1:38:46.878
and the Apocalypse
describes a mescaline experience.

1:38:55.387 --> 1:38:57.513
In these flasks...

1:38:59.516 --> 1:39:02.977
...are all the holy mountains.

1:39:04.271 --> 1:39:07.815
And in this beautiful young man...

1:39:08.776 --> 1:39:10.777
...is eternity.

1:39:14.615 --> 1:39:16.699
To conquer a mountain is easy.

1:39:16.825 --> 1:39:19.702
I can go through solid matter.

1:39:25.084 --> 1:39:28.503
Nothing stops me!

1:39:28.587 --> 1:39:32.382
In a minute I will cross the holy
mountain. Wait for me here!

1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:37.720
I got to the other side of the mountain
in less than a minute.

1:39:37.805 --> 1:39:43.726
- How long until you reach the summit?
- No, I can only advance horizontally.

1:39:43.811 --> 1:39:45.645
That's enough.

1:39:45.729 --> 1:39:48.523
From bottom to top, I can't do.

1:39:48.607 --> 1:39:51.275
But anyway, I am a champion!

1:39:51.402 --> 1:39:54.237
I have conquered
the holy mountain horizontally!

1:39:54.321 --> 1:39:57.740
Horizontally! I am a champion!
I am a champion!

1:39:57.825 --> 1:40:00.076
I founded the academy.
I give the awards!

1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:02.120
Here you can win a trophy every year.

1:40:02.913 --> 1:40:06.165
Idiots!
You don't know what you are losing!

1:40:06.250 --> 1:40:10.253
You could have made history
and we are already forgetting you!

1:40:50.044 --> 1:40:53.588
Help me! I can't go one step farther!

1:40:53.630 --> 1:40:57.425
You're not afraid of falling.
What frightens you is climbing.

1:40:57.468 --> 1:41:01.220
- Rub your clitoris against the mountain.
- You're terrified of success.

1:41:01.472 --> 1:41:03.639
Give yourself to the world!

1:41:48.435 --> 1:41:53.898
I can't lie anymore. My hand is frozen.

1:41:55.526 --> 1:41:58.194
You were never able to forget your body,

1:41:58.278 --> 1:42:01.072
never able to pry yourself
from that love.

1:42:01.198 --> 1:42:04.992
Now the thing you love most
is stopping you from reaching the top.

1:42:05.077 --> 1:42:07.745
You must sacrifice part of your body.

1:42:11.458 --> 1:42:14.377
Cut off your fingers, or go back!

1:42:43.407 --> 1:42:46.701
We have mastered
the difficult part of the mountain.

1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:51.247
Now the way will be like a garden.

1:42:51.373 --> 1:42:56.544
Nevertheless, at this height
our minds will decompose.

1:42:56.628 --> 1:42:59.297
And we will suffer the vision of death.

1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:04.427
- Lies!
- If you don't believe, wait for us here.

1:43:04.469 --> 1:43:08.764
When I return,
I will show you the difficult way.

1:47:25.689 --> 1:47:27.857
There are the lmmortals!

1:47:29.943 --> 1:47:32.862
Meditate here for three hours
before you attack them.

1:47:33.363 --> 1:47:34.613
And you?

1:47:37.033 --> 1:47:40.286
You don't need a master now.

1:47:40.370 --> 1:47:44.081
You can win by yourself. Goodbye.

1:47:52.466 --> 1:47:55.885
This is the way we may reach
that summit.

1:47:55.969 --> 1:47:58.304
Then we will master our bodies.

1:48:00.182 --> 1:48:02.308
You know now what you must do.

1:48:02.392 --> 1:48:06.353
You don't need anyone, you are a master.

1:48:07.564 --> 1:48:09.565
Cut off my head.

1:48:43.266 --> 1:48:45.851
Now you can begin to learn.

1:48:57.906 --> 1:49:01.075
Unite yourself with this good woman,

1:49:01.159 --> 1:49:04.620
who came here only
because she loves you.

1:49:08.959 --> 1:49:13.963
Forget the summits,
reach eternity through love.

1:49:14.089 --> 1:49:16.465
Return to your country.

1:49:16.591 --> 1:49:20.886
I leave you my tower
and my alchemical rooms.

1:49:20.971 --> 1:49:23.556
This is your family and your people.

1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:25.474
Change the world.

1:50:13.148 --> 1:50:14.982
Sit down.

1:50:25.702 --> 1:50:29.997
I promised you the great secret
and I will not disappoint you.

1:50:39.049 --> 1:50:41.884
Is this the end of our adventure?

1:50:41.968 --> 1:50:44.053
Nothing has an end.

1:50:45.055 --> 1:50:48.557
We came in search
of the secret of immortality.

1:50:48.642 --> 1:50:50.976
To be like gods.

1:50:51.061 --> 1:50:54.396
And here we are... mortals.

1:50:54.522 --> 1:50:56.982
More human than ever.

1:50:58.068 --> 1:51:01.278
If we have not obtained immortality,

1:51:01.404 --> 1:51:04.657
at least we have obtained reality.

1:51:04.741 --> 1:51:09.411
We began in a fairytale
and we came to life!

1:51:09.537 --> 1:51:13.832
But is this life reality?

1:51:13.917 --> 1:51:15.584
No.

1:51:15.710 --> 1:51:20.631
It is a film. Zoom back camera.

1:51:28.515 --> 1:51:33.852
We are images, dreams, photographs.

1:51:34.270 --> 1:51:36.980
We must not stay here!

1:51:37.107 --> 1:51:38.941
Prisoners!

1:51:39.025 --> 1:51:41.944
We shall break the illusion.

1:51:42.028 --> 1:51:44.530
This is Maya.

1:51:52.539 --> 1:51:55.290
Goodbye to the holy mountain.

1:51:55.375 --> 1:51:58.252
Real life awaits us.
