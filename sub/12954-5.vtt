00:01.000 --> 00:02.093
Previously on "Alias":

00:02.168 --> 00:06.366
Be awful hard to help that daughter
of yours from inside a federal penitentiary.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.202
Of course, it doesn't have to be that way.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.367
Aftercareful examination ofthefacts,

00:10.443 --> 00:14.140
Arvin Sloane, I herebyorderyourrelease.

00:14.948 --> 00:20.181
The Nuridium wasn't used as an explosive.
It was used to power a cryogenic chamber.

00:20.253 --> 00:21.618
- Hello?
- Hey.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.155
Have you identified the body?

00:23.223 --> 00:26.021
The body was stolen.
I'll forward you the details.

00:26.092 --> 00:28.390
I'll dig around

00:28.461 --> 00:30.622
and see what I can find out.

00:54.287 --> 00:56.380
- (crackle)
- Argh!

01:21.081 --> 01:25.711
Jack. we've got a man down. It's
Rodriguez. Do you copy? Do you copy?

01:25.785 --> 01:27.912
Do you copy? Come in!

01:27.987 --> 01:30.387
(alarm)

02:18.071 --> 02:19.834
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:19.906 --> 02:23.273
I wish I could still fit into those.

02:23.343 --> 02:26.005
- Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah, I did.

02:29.415 --> 02:31.542
You OK?

02:31.618 --> 02:35.987
I'm telling you, this kid's gonna be
a black belt. Here, gimme your hand.

02:36.055 --> 02:38.148
Get ready.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.925
Wow.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.431
You, uh... must be so excited.

02:45.498 --> 02:48.126
Yeah. When I'm not terrified.

02:49.502 --> 02:54.633
- You don't seem terrified.
- I am. I have no idea how to be a parent.

02:55.141 --> 02:58.633
The thought of... my life changing forever...

03:01.514 --> 03:04.244
doing it on my own.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.547
It's a little overwhelming.

03:06.619 --> 03:09.611
Yeah. I know what you mean.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.819
You can stay here as long as you want.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.523
- There's no hurry.
- I don't want to impose.

03:18.598 --> 03:23.592
We're both going through transitions. We...
might as well keep each other company.

03:25.438 --> 03:29.204
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna change.

03:29.275 --> 03:33.041
Help yourself to anything in the fridge.
If there's anything left.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.945
Hey, Syd?

03:36.482 --> 03:39.315
You're gonna be a great mom.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.720
Thanks.

03:54.934 --> 03:58.870
- You seem to be enjoying your freedom.
- I wanted to offer more than prison food.

03:58.938 --> 04:03.204
I must confess, I'd grown rather fond
of the shepherd's pie.

04:06.946 --> 04:10.109
I'm assuming you didn't bring me here
simply for the cuisine.

04:10.183 --> 04:15.951
Look, Jack, in the last few months I've had
to rely on you more than any friend should.

04:16.022 --> 04:19.082
Which is what makes it difficult
for me to ask you this.

04:19.158 --> 04:21.649
You need another favor.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.923
I want to return to APO.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.261
Of course,
my position would be subordinate.

04:26.332 --> 04:30.826
You'd be the director of the task force, and
I would have the highest respect for that.

04:30.903 --> 04:36.603
In return, you can engage my connections,
wherever you thought they'd be effective.

04:36.676 --> 04:41.113
And you would, in turn, have full
ClA resources to search for Nadia's cure.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.040
Exactly.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.145
I know this puts you
in an awkward position.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.519
I've already put in a request
for your limited reinstatement.

04:50.590 --> 04:53.423
You have?

04:53.493 --> 04:56.223
- I don't know what to say.
- Gratitude may be premature.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.265
They didn't deny the request,
but didn't approve it either.

04:59.332 --> 05:02.927
Normally, these things
take a few days, but...

05:03.002 --> 05:07.905
but I'm getting informal reports
that something... or, rather, someone...

05:07.974 --> 05:10.807
is standing in the way.

05:10.877 --> 05:14.870
Do you know who?
I'm happy to make my case personally.

05:15.915 --> 05:19.510
- I'm trying to ascertain that myself.
- (phone rings)

05:21.621 --> 05:23.714
(phone beeps)

05:24.791 --> 05:26.656
I apologize. I have to cut this short.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.957
Whether you're successful or not, Jack...
thank you.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.975
(equipment whines)

06:04.630 --> 06:06.962
(beeping)

06:19.245 --> 06:24.182
1 8 hours ago, an army storage facility
was hit outside of Frankfurt.

06:24.250 --> 06:28.311
- The Dornier stockpile?
- The intruder crossed two minefields,

06:28.388 --> 06:31.016
deactivated a 30,000-volt electric fence

06:31.090 --> 06:34.150
and took down half a dozen army rangers
by nonlethal means.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.092
Any potential suspects?

06:36.162 --> 06:38.596
Agent Grace is on the phone
to the base in Germany,

06:38.664 --> 06:41.758
trying to get uplinks
of their surveillance imagery.

06:42.268 --> 06:45.499
This lone individual walked past
a stockpile of heavy weapons

06:45.571 --> 06:49.974
opting instead for a few hundred CCs
of something called atropine ZX.

06:50.042 --> 06:53.944
ZX is a highly experimental
medical stimulant.

06:54.013 --> 06:57.744
It's used for battlefield resuscitation
of gravely injured soldiers.

06:57.817 --> 07:02.254
The infiltration bears striking similarities
to the DSR theft a month a go.

07:02.321 --> 07:06.189
This is somehow connected with the
container we recovered in North Korea?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.819
It could be the secondary phase
of the same operation.

07:08.895 --> 07:14.765
The man inside the container appeared to
be in some sort of cryogenic deep freeze.

07:14.834 --> 07:18.235
- The stolen ZX could wake up the body?
- It's possible, yes.

07:18.304 --> 07:24.072
Yes, Guelder, I promise. Eight cases of
jerky - half beef, half turkey. It's on the way.

07:24.143 --> 07:26.338
You can't get good beef jerky in Germany.

07:26.412 --> 07:31.145
I always thought of Germany as the home
of processed meats. It's all the sausages:

07:31.217 --> 07:35.517
- liverwurst, bratwurst, Fleischwurst...
- Here it comes.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.523
Let's take a look at our bad boy.

07:38.591 --> 07:41.287
Put it on screen.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.726
Make that a "bad girl."

07:50.803 --> 07:53.328
Renee Rienne,
also known as Le Corbeau.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.102
In '02 she attacked
one of our listening posts in Turkey.

07:56.175 --> 07:59.611
Made her number eight
on the ClA's most wanted list.

07:59.679 --> 08:02.239
You don't know she's the one
who took the body.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.806
But it's beyond reason
this is a coincidence.

08:04.884 --> 08:07.250
If she took it,
she had a reason. I'll talk to her.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.756
You exchange information twice a week.
If she hasn't told you by now...

08:10.823 --> 08:15.021
- Not over the phone. I'll go in person.
- Sydney, this woman is an assassin.

08:15.094 --> 08:18.291
Vaughn trusted her.
They worked together for seven years.

08:18.364 --> 08:22.323
If she took the body and hasn't told me,
it's because she doesn't trust me either.

08:22.401 --> 08:26.667
- Making a move on her proves she's right.
- I'm hardly concerned with her feelings.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.867
No. But I am concerned
about burning her as an ally.

08:29.942 --> 08:32.638
We know the body
was in Dean's possession.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.510
Finding out why
may tell us more about Prophet Five:

08:35.581 --> 08:38.311
what their ultimate agenda is.

08:39.318 --> 08:42.684
Go see her. But you're not going alone.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.228
(Jack) Think you got him.

08:55.535 --> 09:00.336
My mother said if someone's worth
shooting once they're worth shooting twice.

09:00.406 --> 09:03.204
I'm sorry I never met her -
she sounds like my kind of woman.

09:03.276 --> 09:06.837
I think the two of you
would've gotten along.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.341
Sydney's going to Marseilles to meet
with a contact. Wheels up within the hour.

09:13.419 --> 09:16.047
I'd like you to accompany her.

09:17.023 --> 09:20.754
- I'm on escort duty.
- Sydney's contact is Renee Rienne.

09:21.928 --> 09:22.758
Really?

09:22.828 --> 09:27.731
Miss Rienne has been helping Sydney
investigate the Prophet Five conspiracy.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.735
Though that fact is off the books.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.529
Got it.

09:33.606 --> 09:36.268
Miss Rienne used to work
with Michael Vaughn.

09:36.342 --> 09:39.834
Based on that,
my daughter has inherent trust in her.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.214
I do not share her trust.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.950
I see.

09:46.018 --> 09:49.215
Don't worry. I'll make sure she's safe.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.323
Hope you got the right address.

09:58.397 --> 10:02.959
Micro surveillance cameras, motion
sensors on the windows. This is her place.

10:03.035 --> 10:07.734
- I'll cover the stairs. You slip around front.
- Put that away. You won't need it.

10:07.807 --> 10:11.868
She's already killed three ClA agents.
We're not gonna be four and five.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.913
When my father briefed you,
he told you we'd worked together.

10:14.981 --> 10:20.180
He also said if I suspect she's a threat
to your safety, I have orders to kill her.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.315
My father is overprotective.

10:31.597 --> 10:33.497
(phone rings)

10:34.433 --> 10:36.628
- (Renee) Oui?
- It's me. We need to talk.

10:36.702 --> 10:40.365
- It's not a good time.
- It can't wait. I'm out front.

10:40.439 --> 10:42.634
I know.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.914
- We aren't here to threaten you.
- We had an agreement.

10:51.984 --> 10:55.317
I know you took the body.
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

10:55.388 --> 10:59.484
No, I can't. This is different.
I need to do this myself.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.617
That's not an option.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.992
Does he know what you're up to?

11:13.739 --> 11:16.139
No, he's not dangerous.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.173
(gasps)

11:23.349 --> 11:25.180
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

11:25.251 --> 11:27.014
He won't hurt me!

11:27.086 --> 11:29.680
- Let her go! Do you have a shot?
- Just say when.

11:29.755 --> 11:33.156
- Please, he doesn't understand.
- Qui sont ces gens?

11:36.228 --> 11:37.695
C'est moi.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.082
Did I hear her right?

12:01.153 --> 12:03.644
He's her father.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.581
(father)

13:03.349 --> 13:06.250
- Was it Desantis?
- Desantis.

13:23.269 --> 13:26.500
I do not... remember.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.939
Is Desantis part of Prophet Five?

13:32.678 --> 13:36.170
Prophet Five?
What do you know about them?

13:37.183 --> 13:39.344
No, no. I am fine.

13:39.418 --> 13:42.216
You're not fine. Your ear is bleeding.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.381
- Here, get him down. Get him down.
- Papa?

13:48.861 --> 13:52.490
His pulse is all over the place.
We need something to sedate him.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.965
I've got some diazepam.
Keep his head steady.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.468
(Tom) Calm down.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.042
His heartbeat's weak but it's stable.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.849
What do you know about that device?
Why was he in it?

14:16.922 --> 14:20.790
I don't know. I just had
to get him out of there.

14:39.778 --> 14:43.544
How's your daughter?
Nadia, right?

14:44.216 --> 14:48.516
- That's such a pretty name.
- What are you doing here?

14:48.587 --> 14:52.648
Checking up on our investment. Thought
this might be a good place to find you.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.216
Don't you ever contact me in public again.

14:56.128 --> 14:59.723
And tell whoever you answer to
that I'm proceeding as instructed.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.866
Tell them yourself.

15:15.447 --> 15:18.575
- Hello, Arvin.
- Hello, Gordon.

15:19.818 --> 15:22.218
So you're my mysterious benefactor.

15:22.721 --> 15:24.848
I'm one of them.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.415
Are you familiar with Senator Lewis?

15:35.868 --> 15:38.769
She's the chairman
of the intelligence committee.

15:38.837 --> 15:41.863
She's why your security clearance
hasn't been reinstated.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.239
She doesn't seem
to care very much for you.

15:44.310 --> 15:47.507
It may have something to do
with her being a decent human being.

15:47.579 --> 15:49.843
If she's the one standing in my way,

15:49.915 --> 15:53.715
my chances of returning to APO
are slim... at best.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.777
And I need you at APO.

15:57.990 --> 16:02.188
You're going to have to persuade
Senator Lewis to see things your way.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.827
Luckily, that's what you do best.

16:09.268 --> 16:12.601
I gotta be honest with you,
I've had basic field medical training.

16:12.671 --> 16:16.801
If the guy were shot, I could handle that,
but this is beyond me.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.002
- Is he stable?
- That's kinda hard to define.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.171
He was bleeding out of his eyes and ears.

16:21.246 --> 16:24.010
He's unconscious.
His breathing's shallow but regular.

16:24.083 --> 16:28.417
If we knew why he was in the container,
we might have a better idea what's wrong.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.924
I took a look inside the box. It's lined
with lVs, apparently feeding him nutrients.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.586
There's an onboard hard drive
tracking his vitals.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.959
Plus a bunch of tech stuff I can't identify.

16:38.030 --> 16:42.967
I have contacts at the DSR. Maybe they
analyzed the container before it was stolen.

16:43.035 --> 16:46.698
Renee mentioned a name -
a Dr. Aldo Desantis.

16:46.772 --> 16:49.468
Apparently. he put her father in the box
20 years ago.

16:49.541 --> 16:53.773
I know that name. Dean had me arrange
the transfer of some of his files.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.747
They were archived
at the University of Milan,

16:56.815 --> 17:02.617
but about a year ago, Dean had me move
them to a private facility in San Francisco.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.624
Agent Grace, tell Renee we'll coordinate
a mission to obtain the Desantis files.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.955
Perhaps they'll shed light on her father.

17:09.028 --> 17:13.521
Meanwhile, contact Dr. Etienne Laurent.
He's 20 minutes outside Marseilles.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.568
He'll check her father into a facility
under an assumed name

17:16.635 --> 17:18.626
and run a full examination.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.762
I'll contact you when I get there.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.031
- I can take care of him.
- No, you can't.

17:24.108 --> 17:27.771
If my father vouches for this doctor,
your father will be safe.

17:28.280 --> 17:32.046
Look, if we were gonna double-cross you,
we would've done it already.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.847
Just... Iet us help you.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.047
You have my word.

17:37.923 --> 17:40.084
OK.

17:40.159 --> 17:42.855
I'll pull a van around front.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.938
(electrics power down)

17:58.710 --> 18:01.736
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

18:23.335 --> 18:25.496
(door rattles)

18:27.439 --> 18:28.599
(thudding)

18:33.479 --> 18:36.243
- (dials phone)
- (exasperated groan)

18:36.315 --> 18:38.476
(weapons cocked)

18:47.726 --> 18:50.320
(beeping)

18:54.500 --> 18:56.593
(men shout in French)

19:09.081 --> 19:11.174
(phone rings)

19:20.325 --> 19:22.987
(slams phone down)

19:23.061 --> 19:25.495
- They want my father.
- (door opens)

19:25.564 --> 19:29.193
- (Tom) We're under siege.
- They want Renee's father. Who are they?

19:29.268 --> 19:31.259
- Wish I knew.
- It's the DGSE.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.396
Intelligence? No, not French military.
They're armed too well.

19:34.473 --> 19:37.374
- That's why I didn't tell you.
- You think we brought them?

19:37.442 --> 19:40.002
How else would they know?

19:40.078 --> 19:43.138
It's no good.
They're using a jamming device.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.343
- We need weapons.
- Back there. There is a closet.

19:47.019 --> 19:52.355
I have an army radio. If you can find
a clear frequency, call for help.

19:59.998 --> 20:03.764
Inside those cases
there are monitors for the security cameras.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.030
See what we're up against.

20:06.104 --> 20:10.871
There are 1 2 of them, it looks like - at least.
They're planning something. What is it?

20:14.646 --> 20:16.876
- (Renee) What's that?
- Gas.

20:16.949 --> 20:20.077
They wanna knock us out
before they attack us.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.086
They're pumping it into the vents.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.453
Get in the bedroom. Seal yourself in.
I'll take care of the truck.

20:25.524 --> 20:29.324
No, no. I'll go.
You watch your father.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.362
Come on.

20:38.036 --> 20:40.664
- Marshall, Dixon's ready for us.
- Yeah, uh, ready...

20:40.739 --> 20:42.764
It's gotta be here somewhere. Where is it?

20:42.841 --> 20:46.572
You know what an audio coupler is?
It slides over the base of a phone headset.

20:46.645 --> 20:50.376
- Yeah. Like from WarGames.
- You know WarGames?

20:51.550 --> 20:54.849
- Yeah, it's my second favorite movie.
- Really? Mine too.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.447
It's what inspired me
to hack into the Pentagon for the first time.

20:58.857 --> 21:04.056
- How'd you get in?
- l... went in through the electrical system.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.927
There was a side wire cut out
for air conditioning repair.

21:06.999 --> 21:11.060
I called the repair company and convinced
the woman I was inside the building

21:11.136 --> 21:14.628
and then sweet-talked her into giving me
the password. Her name was lna.

21:14.706 --> 21:18.164
I went straight in
through the sewer controls.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.803
Really? That's... that's pretty smart.

21:20.879 --> 21:23.211
And a lot... easier.

21:25.817 --> 21:28.581
Are we hacking into
the storage facility's network?

21:28.654 --> 21:30.952
Yeah, to find out
where the Desantis files are.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.617
If we're going in via RF,
the network must be terminal.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.683
No, closed loop.

21:35.761 --> 21:36.819
Oh!

21:36.895 --> 21:39.022
Found it!

21:44.903 --> 21:47.565
I, uh, hope none of you suffer
from arachnophobia,

21:47.639 --> 21:53.441
'cause this little six-legged freak
is not pretty, but she gets the job done.

21:53.512 --> 21:56.003
I call her Charlotte, for obvious reasons.

21:56.081 --> 21:59.244
Check this out. There is a tomographic
camera on the bottom.

21:59.318 --> 22:04.119
It basically acts like an x-ray or
a CAT scan. It takes images layer by layer.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.521
See? Look at that.

22:08.927 --> 22:12.328
This will allow us
to take images of the Desantis files...

22:12.397 --> 22:15.127
Without having to remove them
from their container.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.462
Right.

22:19.237 --> 22:22.035
- (Dixon) The vault is climate-controlled?
- Of course.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.598
Now, if you purchase
our premium package,

22:24.676 --> 22:28.271
your item will be stored
in the most secure wing of our facility.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.475
Yes. I've heard that before.

22:32.684 --> 22:37.121
Let me explain something. This
particular piece is from Yung Lo period.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.316
Very delicate.

22:39.391 --> 22:42.053
I don't want the most secure wing.

22:42.127 --> 22:46.257
I want the wing you reserve for
the people who will come looking for you

22:46.331 --> 22:49.823
if anything happens to their stuff.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.536
Right this way.

22:55.907 --> 23:00.367
(sighs) My cell died. Call my wife, would
you? Let her know we're running late.

23:00.445 --> 23:03.005
- Would you mind?
- Of course not. Be my guest.

23:03.081 --> 23:05.242
Thank you.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.682
(phone beeps)

23:14.826 --> 23:17.260
Hi, Meredith.
We're running a little bit behind.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.593
Nice. Phone link is good.

23:19.664 --> 23:22.132
Accessing the network.

23:27.005 --> 23:29.200
Uh, just stay on the phone
one more minute.

23:29.274 --> 23:31.367
Yeah, I'll have him home by dinner.

23:39.184 --> 23:42.085
- Got it.
- (hangs up)

23:42.154 --> 23:45.590
As you can see, temperature
and humidity-controlled.

23:45.657 --> 23:50.185
We even have backup generators
in case of a prolonged blackout.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.527
- This is fine.
- I'm glad you're pleased.

23:57.102 --> 24:02.301
Well, if you'll just follow me,
we can finish the rest of our paperwork.

24:08.547 --> 24:10.947
(beeping and whining)

24:14.386 --> 24:17.082
Come on, Charlotte. You go, girl.

24:26.031 --> 24:28.761
Come on, Charlotte. Don't let me down.

24:38.877 --> 24:44.315
- How's it coming?
- Their network says the files are in 21 87.

24:44.382 --> 24:48.011
So... we'll soon see for ourselves.

24:50.889 --> 24:54.154
Come on, Charlotte. Work some magic.

24:54.226 --> 24:57.423
All right, imaging
through the first layer of metal.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.794
Desantis. We got 'em.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.600
Good. Let's scan the rest of
those documents and relay them to APO.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.694
OK.

25:06.771 --> 25:09.069
(static and noise)

25:16.381 --> 25:18.872
(Renee) Any luck?

25:18.950 --> 25:21.612
Low-band frequencies
are completely blocked.

25:21.686 --> 25:24.678
- I found this in mid-range.
- (crackling radio chatter)

25:24.756 --> 25:28.317
Chatter of some kind.
But it's too noisy to transmit over.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.622
He's got a fever.

25:32.697 --> 25:35.393
Why do they want him, Renee?

25:37.102 --> 25:39.002
Tell me the truth.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.932
I was very sick as a child.

25:43.008 --> 25:45.442
The medicine I was taking,
it was expensive.

25:45.877 --> 25:50.439
My father answered an ad
in the newspaper for a job.

25:51.983 --> 25:56.352
Later that week, he came home
with more money than I had ever seen.

25:56.421 --> 25:58.548
I could tell he was scared.

26:00.292 --> 26:03.819
He packed what he could, and we left.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.557
He didn't want to scare me...

26:06.631 --> 26:09.600
but I knew he was running from someone.

26:10.502 --> 26:12.766
One day, in Geneva, they found us.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.078
(men talk in low voices)

26:42.233 --> 26:46.966
I later found out that the man
I saw take my father was Desantis.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.970
They were his clinical trials
my father had been paid for.

26:56.581 --> 26:59.414
I assumed they killed him that night.

26:59.484 --> 27:02.453
This is why you began
pursuing Prophet Five.

27:03.521 --> 27:06.115
To make them pay.

27:11.663 --> 27:15.463
(man) Allez-y. on est prets. Alors?

27:15.533 --> 27:17.967
- Vous allez par la?
- Bon. vous. par la.

27:18.036 --> 27:20.368
(man #1) Tout de suite. hein?

27:21.439 --> 27:23.430
On est prets. Deuxieme etage. c'est ca.

27:23.508 --> 27:24.839
(cries out)

27:25.276 --> 27:27.836
(groans)

28:05.283 --> 28:06.978
(high-pitched whining)

28:07.052 --> 28:08.519
(beeps)

28:08.586 --> 28:10.349
(man) Que faites-vous?

28:11.122 --> 28:13.386
Je demande ce que vous faites vous.

28:20.265 --> 28:22.392
(man) Vite. vite! On nous suit!

28:23.635 --> 28:25.398
(men shout)

28:36.281 --> 28:39.580
- What can you see?
- Nothing. I don't know if he made it.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.778
(glass smashes)

28:48.359 --> 28:50.384
- Renee?
- Papa?

29:00.305 --> 29:01.431
(banging on door)

29:01.506 --> 29:04.066
(Tom) It's me. Let me in.

29:11.349 --> 29:13.476
Nice job.

29:16.321 --> 29:18.619
I think I just pissed 'em off.

29:18.690 --> 29:22.023
We need to get ready.
They'll be coming in soon.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.220
Sydney, you stay here with her father.

29:24.295 --> 29:28.755
If I can take enough of them out,
maybe they'll decide we're not worth it.

29:41.312 --> 29:45.305
(woman) That's great.
Good. Keep your back up.

29:46.885 --> 29:51.720
Over your toe. Stay over your toe.
Good.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.782
- She's quite talented.
- Thank you.

29:55.326 --> 29:59.023
- You must be very proud.
- You have no idea.

30:01.366 --> 30:04.961
- Senator Lewis.
- What can I do for you, Mr. Sloane?

30:05.937 --> 30:09.839
Well, actually, I was hoping
for a minute of your time.

30:09.908 --> 30:14.743
If you've come to lobby for your security
clearance, save yourself the trouble.

30:14.813 --> 30:20.149
Yeah. I understand your reluctance, but
I'm asking you to reconsider your position.

30:20.218 --> 30:25.212
With my knowledge and my resources,
I could be a valuable asset to this country.

30:25.290 --> 30:30.023
Touching. But somehow I doubt
that you're motivated by mere patriotism.

30:30.094 --> 30:33.029
You're right. I have an agenda.

30:33.097 --> 30:35.497
My daughter, Nadia.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.661
- She's very sick.
- I know.

30:38.736 --> 30:42.866
I hope to use APO resources
to find a cure for her condition.

30:42.941 --> 30:47.139
In exchange, I will happily do
whatever the government requires of me.

30:48.446 --> 30:50.607
I'm sorry about your daughter.

30:51.583 --> 30:55.144
But I can't in good conscience
put you back in that office.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.882
If it were up to me, you'd still be in prison.

30:57.956 --> 31:03.952
You'll have to find another way to help
Nadia. I'm not reinstating your clearance.

31:07.665 --> 31:10.156
Your daughter's very lovely.

31:12.437 --> 31:14.928
I'm sure you're proud of her.

31:15.006 --> 31:17.941
You'll recognize
the inside of your own house.

31:18.009 --> 31:20.978
None of those pictures
were taken with a telephoto lens.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.639
The photographer
was standing right next to her.

31:23.715 --> 31:27.776
Makes you wonder
about her security detail, doesn't it?

31:27.852 --> 31:31.481
Makes you wonder
if you can ever keep her safe at all.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.049
- Mom, did you see that?
- I did, honey.

31:36.127 --> 31:38.925
I was just telling your mother
how talented you are.

31:38.997 --> 31:42.228
- You know, you skate like an angel.
- Thank you.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.996
You're welcome.

31:48.172 --> 31:51.198
Enjoy the rest of your day, Senator.

31:51.276 --> 31:53.972
Thank you in advance for your support.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.548
(Renee) They're gone.

32:08.626 --> 32:11.754
- What do you mean, they're "gone"?
- They're not in the street.

32:11.829 --> 32:15.094
- That's 'cause they're probably on the roof.
- (glass smashes)

32:16.601 --> 32:18.899
- You're hurt.
- It's nothing.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.665
(beeping)

32:24.742 --> 32:28.735
I found this device. They all have them.
It's a tracker.

32:29.747 --> 32:33.513
- They're probably following the signal.
- From what?

32:37.989 --> 32:41.755
An emergency beacon. Must've activated it
when you opened the container.

32:41.826 --> 32:44.226
- I would've noticed.
- The signal's active.

32:44.295 --> 32:48.561
It's not jamming the frequency it transmits
on. Maybe I can piggyback the signal,

32:48.633 --> 32:50.601
get out a call for help.

32:53.204 --> 32:54.193
Jack.

32:54.272 --> 32:59.073
I've received hard copies of data the DSR
obtained before the container was stolen.

32:59.143 --> 33:03.102
Marshall and Rachel are reviewing
the files you recovered from San Francisco.

33:03.181 --> 33:05.513
And I'll cross-indexthedata.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.778
Is there something else, Marcus?

33:08.853 --> 33:12.220
I just got off the phone
with the office of Senator Diane Lewis.

33:12.290 --> 33:15.657
- The chair of the intelligence committee.
- Yes, I know who she is.

33:15.727 --> 33:21.529
Her office was following up on a request to
reinstate Arvin Sloane's security clearance,

33:21.599 --> 33:26.866
so he could return to duty within APO.
I told them I didn't know anything about it.

33:26.938 --> 33:33.434
The request to reinstate Sloane's clearance
came from me. I assume it was granted?

33:33.511 --> 33:37.607
He's been given full access -
gold level and beyond.

33:37.682 --> 33:41.049
Are you certain
this is the right course of action?

33:41.119 --> 33:47.149
I believe Arvin Sloane now has a single
purpose - to save the life of his daughter.

33:47.225 --> 33:52.322
If it is within my power to help him
with that endeavour, I will do so gladly.

33:52.397 --> 33:54.991
Of course.

33:59.504 --> 34:04.669
I suppose having him at APO will allow us
to keep a close eye on his activities.

34:04.742 --> 34:08.109
Yes, that thought crossed my mind as well.

34:11.815 --> 34:14.250
Oh, I got it. Here it is.

34:14.752 --> 34:17.380
Uh, actually this is "Garsaud," with an a.

34:17.455 --> 34:20.891
- Yeah, this is here. Look. Goursaud.
- Oh, Goursaud. Excellent.

34:20.958 --> 34:24.587
Here. Looks like some sort
of chemical study, but it's all encoded.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.495
The blood work, brain scans
and x-rays are all normal.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.056
This is also... yes, 20 years old.

34:30.134 --> 34:33.728
All this tells us is that Goursaud
was healthy at the time he was abducted.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.364
- What've you got?
- Well, I'll tell you one thing...

34:36.440 --> 34:41.344
this guy's into freaky stuff - manipulation
of neural pathways, genetic manipulations.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.210
- Anything on Goursaud?
- Nothing that helps.

34:45.183 --> 34:48.812
The DSR sent over everything they had
on the container.

34:48.886 --> 34:53.482
Looks like while Goursaud was inside,
his brain functions were severely limited.

34:53.558 --> 34:56.857
The container was also administering
doses of antiproliferatives

34:56.928 --> 34:59.123
and... calico-neural inhibitors.

34:59.197 --> 35:01.893
Calcineurin inhibitors, actually,
with a s sound.

35:01.966 --> 35:05.163
It's an immunosuppressive drug,
basically -

35:05.236 --> 35:07.761
prevents the immune system
from attacking itself.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.434
Kind of like... you know, when
a transplant patient rejects a new organ.

35:11.509 --> 35:14.342
But... he hasn't had any transplants.

35:14.879 --> 35:17.939
Wait a minute,
is that Goursaud's EEG reading?

35:22.286 --> 35:23.810
I don't get this.

35:23.888 --> 35:28.052
- (Jack) Brain scans.
- One from the Desantis files, one off DSR.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.991
- How old are these?
- Three weeks.

35:30.061 --> 35:32.222
They don't match.
A by-product of aging?

35:32.296 --> 35:35.663
- Not gray matter. Volume is set by four.
- Age four.

35:35.733 --> 35:39.100
The man who came out of that container
is not Luc Goursaud?

35:39.170 --> 35:40.228
That's right.

35:40.304 --> 35:40.998
Then who is he?

35:41.072 --> 35:44.599
This is somebody w-who...
who's not Luc Goursaud.

35:44.675 --> 35:48.509
I just called the clinic in France.
Sydney and Tom never showed up.

35:48.579 --> 35:51.776
I tried her cell - no answer.

35:53.384 --> 35:57.150
The people who took me,
they want me back.

35:58.222 --> 36:00.452
Give me to them...

36:00.525 --> 36:03.517
- and you all walk out of here.
- That's not an option.

36:03.594 --> 36:09.555
20 years ago I let them capture me...
to keep Renee safe.

36:10.368 --> 36:12.666
Nothing has changed.

36:12.737 --> 36:15.604
I am her father.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.664
It is my job to protect her.

36:18.109 --> 36:21.567
But giving yourself to them
won't protect Renee.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.841
It will destroy her if you're killed.

36:24.382 --> 36:27.180
- They won't kill me.
- You can't know that.

36:27.251 --> 36:32.154
Once they had tracked the beacon up here,
they could have blown us to bits,

36:32.223 --> 36:34.748
but they did not.

36:35.393 --> 36:38.055
They want me alive.

36:39.564 --> 36:42.032
Living.

36:42.099 --> 36:44.590
What beacon?

36:45.570 --> 36:48.198
You just said they tracked a beacon.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.038
What beacon?

37:03.654 --> 37:06.145
Put the radio down.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.556
- Papa?
- This woman was trying to kill me.

37:08.626 --> 37:11.390
He's lying.
He's the reason we're being attacked.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.191
- Let her go.
- Don't!

37:17.702 --> 37:20.569
They tracked a beacon.
He sent a signal. He led them here.

37:20.638 --> 37:23.266
Don't listen to her.
She's only trying to confuse us.

37:23.341 --> 37:26.504
This isn't an abduction.
It's a rescue.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.807
How do you know about the beacon?

37:33.751 --> 37:36.345
I'm your father, remember?
I protected you!

37:36.420 --> 37:39.048
That's right. Your father protected you.

37:39.123 --> 37:43.753
That night when Desantis kidnapped him,
you said he left you somewhere safe.

37:43.828 --> 37:46.388
- Ask him where he hid you.
- That is silly.

37:46.464 --> 37:48.762
Askhim, Renee.Askhim.

37:49.734 --> 37:52.100
Tell me.

37:52.970 --> 37:55.268
That was 20 years ago, angel.

37:55.706 --> 37:58.698
For you it was only yesterday.

37:59.877 --> 38:01.777
Who are you?

38:39.517 --> 38:42.816
APO tracked the helicopter
to a small airport.

38:42.887 --> 38:47.824
Shortly after it landed, an executive jet
took off, bound for North Korea.

38:48.693 --> 38:50.854
Andthatman?

38:51.862 --> 38:54.228
We still don't know. We're working on it.

38:55.399 --> 38:58.027
We've seen things like this before,
believe it or not -

38:58.102 --> 39:01.970
doubling technology -
but it's impossible to say.

39:02.373 --> 39:04.864
My team is still reviewing Desantis' papers.

39:04.942 --> 39:07.877
Hopefully, they'll give us some insight
into Prophet Five.

39:07.945 --> 39:11.506
I'll contact you
as soon as we know anything.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.752
I thought I had him back.

39:20.825 --> 39:22.725
I know.

39:23.227 --> 39:27.186
Michael... always told me
I could come to you.

39:28.199 --> 39:32.101
I didn't trust him. I was wrong.

39:35.573 --> 39:38.098
Thank you.

39:39.443 --> 39:42.105
(whispers) Yeah.

39:53.357 --> 39:54.688
(door opens)

40:00.264 --> 40:02.357
(monitors beep)

40:07.238 --> 40:10.207
Gordon Dean.
How are you feeling, Dr. Desantis?

40:11.375 --> 40:13.366
Couldn't be better, thank you.

40:13.444 --> 40:17.437
I'm told there shouldn't be any lingering
side effects from the procedure.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.779
23 years.

40:20.618 --> 40:26.352
The cohesion problem was solved once we
understood resequencing the information.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.622
The girl's alive.

40:29.693 --> 40:33.993
She calls herself Renee Rienne.
Works with the ClA.

40:34.598 --> 40:38.159
Well... Then keeping an eye on her
won't be a problem.

40:39.303 --> 40:41.294
(chuckles)

41:43.667 --> 41:45.191
(children) Bad robot!

41:46.305 --> 41:52.781
