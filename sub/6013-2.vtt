WEBVTT

00:00.736 --> 00:03.030
So I'm on line at the supermarket.

00:05.429 --> 00:06.680
Two women in front of me.

00:07.410 --> 00:11.268
One of them, her total was $8.
The other, $3.

00:12.832 --> 00:16.168
They both, of course, choose
to pay by the use of the check.

00:18.567 --> 00:21.799
Fact is, if it is a woman in front of you
that's writing out the check...

00:22.008 --> 00:23.572
... you'll not be waiting long.

00:23.676 --> 00:25.970
I have noticed that women
are very fast with checks.

00:26.178 --> 00:29.098
You know, because they write
out so many checks.

00:29.307 --> 00:32.226
The keys, they can never find.
They don't know where that is.

00:33.790 --> 00:35.980
But the checkbook, they got that.

00:36.188 --> 00:37.753
They never fumble
for the checkbook.

00:37.857 --> 00:39.525
The checkbook
comes out of a holster.

00:39.629 --> 00:41.715
"Who do I make it out to?

00:44.113 --> 00:45.990
There's my ID. "

00:53.810 --> 00:57.355
There's something about a check,
that, to a man, is not masculine.

00:57.564 --> 01:00.484
I don't know exactly what it is.
I think, to a man...

01:00.588 --> 01:02.569
... a check is like a note
from your mother.

01:02.778 --> 01:05.593
"I don't have any money,
but if you'll contact these people...

01:06.531 --> 01:10.181
... l'm sure they'll stick up for me. If you
could just trust me this one time.

01:10.389 --> 01:12.892
I don't have any money,
but I have these.

01:14.143 --> 01:16.124
I wrote on these.

01:16.646 --> 01:19.357
Is this of any value at all?"

01:26.974 --> 01:28.225
What's that one?

01:28.434 --> 01:30.624
Cocoon II, The Return.

01:30.832 --> 01:32.709
I guess they didn't like it up there.

01:33.022 --> 01:35.003
Maybe they came back
for Chinese food.

01:35.107 --> 01:37.088
You know, Maureen Stapleton
gets a craving...

01:37.297 --> 01:39.695
... she's probably screaming
at those aliens:

01:39.800 --> 01:41.885
"I gotta have a lo mein. "

01:44.596 --> 01:47.516
Okay, what are we doing here?
I have seen everything.

01:47.724 --> 01:49.392
Oh, yeah?

01:50.018 --> 01:52.625
I don't believe you've seen this.

01:52.833 --> 01:55.857
- Oh, lovely.
- Yeah.

01:56.274 --> 01:59.194
What do you think their parents think?

01:59.402 --> 02:02.114
"So, what's your son doing now,
Dr. Stevens?"

02:02.322 --> 02:05.659
"Oh, he's a public fornicator. "

02:06.076 --> 02:08.473
"Yes, he's a fine boy. "

02:10.247 --> 02:13.166
You know, this would be a really
funny gift for Pamela's birthday.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.252
Pamela. Do I know her?

02:15.356 --> 02:17.858
Yeah, you met her when
we were going out.

02:18.067 --> 02:20.361
Oh, yeah, right.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.698
You have no idea who I'm
talking about, do you?

02:23.906 --> 02:25.679
No.

02:25.887 --> 02:29.850
Blond hair, remember? Glasses.

02:30.579 --> 02:34.020
Have you totally blocked out
the entire time we were a couple?

02:34.646 --> 02:36.836
- Riverside Drive.
- Right.

02:37.253 --> 02:40.381
In fact... No. Never mind.

02:42.258 --> 02:43.926
Well, what is it?

02:44.552 --> 02:47.367
A bunch of people are getting
together tomorrow at some bar...

02:47.576 --> 02:49.140
... for her birthday, but...

02:49.244 --> 02:51.955
You don't want to go to that.
No. Okay.

02:52.893 --> 02:55.917
Wait a second. Wait a second.

02:56.126 --> 02:58.107
We could work out a little deal here.

02:58.733 --> 03:01.652
- What little deal?
- I will go to that...

03:01.756 --> 03:04.780
... you go with me to the little
family wedding I have on Saturday.

03:05.093 --> 03:06.240
A wedding?

03:06.449 --> 03:10.932
- Have you lost it, man?
- My parents are coming in for this.

03:11.037 --> 03:12.809
- They're coming in?
- Yeah, tomorrow.

03:13.018 --> 03:15.207
Hey, did your father
ever get that hair weave?

03:15.520 --> 03:16.772
No, no.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.378
Still doing the big sweep across.

03:20.317 --> 03:21.777
Why does he do that?

03:21.881 --> 03:23.445
Doesn't think anyone can tell.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.701
So, come on, do we have a deal?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.161
A wedding?

03:31.265 --> 03:33.768
There's a lot of people to mock.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.251
- All right. What the hell.
- Great.

03:38.460 --> 03:42.944
When you're dead, you're dead.
That's it. You're not going anywhere.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.732
- Come on, let's go.
- Was I supposed to bring something?

03:50.941 --> 03:52.713
- You could have.
- I met her one time.

03:52.818 --> 03:55.424
- It is not necessary.
- Then what did you say that for?

03:55.529 --> 03:57.718
- Hi.
- Hi, Pamela.

03:57.823 --> 04:00.221
- You remember Jerry?
- Yes, we met.

04:00.325 --> 04:03.349
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

04:03.557 --> 04:05.747
Everybody, this is Jerry and Elaine.

04:05.851 --> 04:07.103
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:07.311 --> 04:09.605
I didn't bring anything.

04:10.126 --> 04:13.150
- I put you two right here.
- Oh, okay.

04:14.506 --> 04:16.904
I'm sorry. I didn't know what...
You know.

04:17.634 --> 04:19.928
Nobody's told me anything
about this...

04:20.971 --> 04:23.473
How big a tip you think it
would take to get him to stop?

04:23.995 --> 04:25.246
I'm in for 5.

04:25.350 --> 04:26.914
I'll supply the hat.

04:27.644 --> 04:30.042
What do we have here?

04:30.146 --> 04:32.649
Why don't you relax,
and take your jacket off.

04:32.858 --> 04:35.360
I can't. I have a tendency
to get chilly.

04:36.090 --> 04:37.863
How masculine.

04:37.967 --> 04:42.242
Plus I'm wearing short sleeves.
I don't want to expose my tattoos.

04:43.493 --> 04:45.891
She's unbelievable.

04:45.996 --> 04:50.167
- Hey, this guy says he know Bricker.
- Oh, you know Bricker? From where?

04:50.271 --> 04:51.731
What's going on here?

04:51.835 --> 04:54.754
Got to be her boyfriend.
She's too good to be alone.

04:54.859 --> 04:57.153
What's the difference?
I can't manoeuvre anyway...

04:57.257 --> 04:58.508
... with Elaine next to me.

04:58.717 --> 05:01.636
- How do you know Pamela?
- Friend of a friend.

05:01.949 --> 05:03.930
- And you?
- We went to law school together.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.807
Oh, Jerry.

05:05.911 --> 05:09.248
Oh, no. Not now.

05:10.499 --> 05:12.689
I had this dream last night,
and you were in it.

05:12.898 --> 05:14.149
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.651
Oh, God, I gotta get out of this.

05:16.964 --> 05:19.571
You were you, but you weren't you.

05:20.405 --> 05:22.073
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

05:22.282 --> 05:25.410
Why is this happening?
Please mak e her stop.

05:25.619 --> 05:28.747
I think... I think we were in my
house where I grew up...

05:28.851 --> 05:31.666
... and you were standing there.
You were looking out the window.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.647
This is brutal.

05:33.856 --> 05:38.340
And then you turned around,
and you had these wooden teeth.

05:39.070 --> 05:41.051
How do you like that?

05:41.259 --> 05:42.928
Can I turn now? Is this over?

05:43.762 --> 05:47.307
No, I can't. I can't. I'm stuck.

05:48.141 --> 05:50.018
Jerry, are you listening to me?

05:50.227 --> 05:51.478
Yes. I heard you.

05:51.686 --> 05:54.814
Elaine, what's the name of that
jewellery store you took me to that time?

05:55.232 --> 05:57.421
Thank you, Pamela.

05:57.630 --> 05:58.673
So, you're a lawyer?

05:58.985 --> 06:01.071
Sagman, Bennett, Robbins,
Oppenheim and Taff.

06:01.592 --> 06:05.659
Sagman, Bennett,
Robbins, Oppenheim and Taff.

06:06.910 --> 06:09.308
Of course, they handled
my tattoo-removal lawsuit.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.394
- Oh, that was you.
- Imagine.

06:11.602 --> 06:13.062
Spelling "mom" with two O's.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.356
That's very funny.

06:15.460 --> 06:17.754
- What do you do?
- Comedian.

06:17.963 --> 06:20.257
Really? That explains it.

06:20.778 --> 06:25.157
Sagman, Bennett,
Robbins, Oppenheim and Taff.

06:25.470 --> 06:26.826
You ready?

06:27.034 --> 06:29.224
We gotta run. Happy birthday.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.726
- Bye, everyone.
- Thanks for coming.

06:31.935 --> 06:33.812
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.689
I can't believe it. I got nothing.

06:36.419 --> 06:37.983
I don't even know her name.

06:38.191 --> 06:42.258
Sagman, Bennett, Robbins,
Oppenheim and Taff.

06:48.397 --> 06:50.065
That wasn't so bad, really.

06:51.317 --> 06:52.985
You know...

06:54.340 --> 06:56.426
... you could use a little work
on your manners.

06:57.156 --> 06:59.137
Why? What did I do?

06:59.450 --> 07:02.578
Well, I just don't appreciate
these little courtesy responses...

07:02.682 --> 07:06.853
... like I'm selling you aluminium siding.
- I was listening.

07:06.957 --> 07:10.502
No. You couldn't wait to get back
to your little conversation.

07:10.711 --> 07:14.569
No. You were talking
about the dream you had...

07:14.673 --> 07:17.384
... where you had wooden teeth.
- No!

07:17.593 --> 07:19.470
No! You had wooden teeth!

07:19.678 --> 07:22.806
You had wooden teeth.
I didn't have them, you did.

07:23.015 --> 07:25.517
All right, so I had wooden teeth.
So what?

07:25.726 --> 07:28.333
So... So nothing. Nothing.

07:35.529 --> 07:38.032
- Hey.
- There he is.

07:38.136 --> 07:40.326
This is what I like. See?

07:40.430 --> 07:43.767
You come home, your parents
are in your bed.

07:45.956 --> 07:48.667
You know, Jerry,
we don't have to do this.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.274
What are you talking about?
I love having you here.

07:51.795 --> 07:54.819
- Tomorrow, we'll go to a hotel.
- Ma, will you stop?

07:55.028 --> 07:56.905
No. Why should we take over
your apartment?

07:57.113 --> 07:59.199
I don't care. I'm sleeping next door.

07:59.303 --> 08:00.867
Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?

08:00.971 --> 08:02.640
No. He's making a bouillabaisse.

08:03.995 --> 08:06.706
So, Dad, let me ask you a question.

08:06.810 --> 08:09.522
How many people work
at these big law offices?

08:09.730 --> 08:11.815
- Depends on the firm.
- Yeah, but if you called...

08:12.024 --> 08:14.839
... and described someone,
you think they would know who it was?

08:15.152 --> 08:16.820
What's the matter, you need a lawyer?

08:17.446 --> 08:21.096
I met someone. I know where she
works, but I don't know her name.

08:21.304 --> 08:23.285
Why don't you ask
someone who was at the party?

08:23.702 --> 08:26.518
No. The only one I could ask
is Elaine. I can't ask her.

08:26.726 --> 08:30.376
- Why not?
- Because it's complicated.

08:30.584 --> 08:32.669
There's some tension there.

08:32.878 --> 08:34.650
He used to go with her.

08:34.755 --> 08:36.318
- Which one is she?
- From Maryland.

08:36.528 --> 08:39.447
She brought the chocolate-covered
cherries you didn't like.

08:39.552 --> 08:42.888
Oh, yeah. Very alert. Warm person.

08:43.097 --> 08:44.557
Oh, yeah, she's great.

08:44.765 --> 08:46.851
So how come nothing
materialized there?

08:46.955 --> 08:50.396
Well, it's a tough thing
to talk about.

08:52.898 --> 08:56.026
- I don't know.
- I know what it was.

08:56.131 --> 08:58.842
You don't know what it was.

08:58.946 --> 09:00.510
So what was it?

09:01.448 --> 09:03.742
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.

09:04.159 --> 09:06.766
- Oh, well.
- Oh, well.

09:07.496 --> 09:10.624
And there was a little problem
with the physical chemistry.

09:17.715 --> 09:20.634
Well, I think she's
a very attractive girl.

09:21.051 --> 09:22.615
She is. She absolutely is.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.701
I can see if there was
a weight problem...

09:24.909 --> 09:26.265
No, it's not that.

09:26.473 --> 09:27.933
It wasn't all one-sided.

09:28.350 --> 09:31.583
You know you can't be so particular.
Nobody's perfect.

09:31.791 --> 09:34.085
- I know, I know.
- You know, Jerry...

09:34.190 --> 09:35.962
... good thing I wasn't so particular.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.360
Idiot.

09:39.195 --> 09:43.053
- Who you looking for, Sophia Loren?
- That's got nothing to do with it.

09:43.782 --> 09:46.285
How about Loni Anderson?

09:46.806 --> 09:48.996
Where do you get Loni Anderson?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.081
Why, what's wrong
with Loni Anderson?

09:51.290 --> 09:53.375
I like Elaine more than
Loni Anderson.

09:53.584 --> 09:56.295
What are you two talking about?

09:56.399 --> 09:58.380
Look, Elaine just wasn't the one.

09:58.797 --> 10:00.362
And this other one's the one?

10:00.570 --> 10:04.741
- I don't know. Maybe.
- So ask Elaine there for the number.

10:04.949 --> 10:06.722
I can't. She'll get upset.

10:06.931 --> 10:09.016
I never talk about
other women with her...

10:09.225 --> 10:12.040
... especially this one tonight.
- How could you still see her...

10:12.144 --> 10:14.855
... if you're not interested?
- We're friends.

10:15.064 --> 10:17.566
Doesn't sound like you're friends.
If you were friends...

10:17.775 --> 10:20.277
... you'd ask her for the number.

10:20.382 --> 10:23.093
- Do you know where this one works?
- Oh, yeah.

10:23.197 --> 10:24.657
So go up to the office.

10:24.865 --> 10:26.325
Up to her office?

10:26.534 --> 10:27.889
Go to the building.

10:28.098 --> 10:29.766
She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?

10:30.392 --> 10:32.790
- I guess.
- So you stand in the lobby...

10:32.998 --> 10:36.335
... by the elevator and wait for her
to come down for lunch.

10:37.065 --> 10:39.359
You mean stake out the lobby?

10:39.880 --> 10:43.425
Morty, that's ridiculous.
Just ask Elaine for the number.

10:43.634 --> 10:45.615
He doesn't want to ask Elaine
for the number.

10:45.824 --> 10:48.118
So you got him standing
by the elevator like a dope.

10:48.326 --> 10:51.663
- What happens when he sees her?
- He pretends he bumped into her.

10:54.374 --> 10:57.815
You know what?
This is not that bad an idea.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:08.701 --> 11:12.246
- What does she look like?
- I don't know. It's hard to say.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.540
What actress does she
remind you of?

11:15.166 --> 11:16.417
Loni Anderson.

11:18.294 --> 11:19.545
Loni Anderson?

11:19.754 --> 11:22.674
What, there's something wrong
with Loni Anderson?

11:22.778 --> 11:25.280
Hey, listen, thanks again
for running over here.

11:25.489 --> 11:28.304
Yeah, sure. I was showing
a condo on 48th Street.

11:28.408 --> 11:31.015
Besides, you think
I want to miss this?

11:32.788 --> 11:35.916
- I'm a little nervous.
- Yeah. Me too.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.565
If I see her, what do I say
I'm doing in the building?

11:39.774 --> 11:41.651
To see me. I work in the building.

11:41.866 --> 11:43.221
What do you do?

11:44.264 --> 11:46.036
I'm an architect.

11:46.975 --> 11:48.330
You're an architect?

11:49.060 --> 11:50.624
I'm not?

11:53.752 --> 11:56.046
I don't see architecture
coming from you.

11:59.487 --> 12:02.407
I suppose you could be an architect.

12:02.511 --> 12:04.909
I never said that I was the architect.

12:05.014 --> 12:07.620
- Just something else.
- She's not even going to ask.

12:07.725 --> 12:09.602
If we see her, which is remote.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.896
What do you want me to say,
I just wandered in?

12:12.313 --> 12:14.815
We're having lunch with a friend.
He works here.

12:15.441 --> 12:17.109
What is his name?

12:17.839 --> 12:20.341
Burt Har...

12:20.446 --> 12:23.053
... binson. Burt Harbinson.

12:23.157 --> 12:25.034
- Burt Harbinson.
- Right.

12:25.242 --> 12:28.058
- It sounds made-up.
- No good?

12:28.475 --> 12:30.143
All right.

12:30.352 --> 12:32.333
Art...

12:32.645 --> 12:34.627
... Core.

12:35.044 --> 12:36.712
Art Core.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.215
Velay.

12:40.153 --> 12:42.134
- Corevelay?
- Yeah, right.

12:42.238 --> 12:44.115
Well, what does he do?

12:45.367 --> 12:47.139
He's an importer.

12:47.348 --> 12:49.225
Just imports? No exports?

12:49.433 --> 12:51.623
He's an importer-exporter, okay?

12:55.481 --> 12:57.045
Did Elaine ever call you back?

12:57.253 --> 12:59.860
No. I guess she's still mad.

13:00.173 --> 13:02.884
I don't understand. You never talk
to her about other women?

13:03.093 --> 13:04.448
Never.

13:07.055 --> 13:09.245
Wait a second. That's her.

13:09.453 --> 13:11.017
On the right.

13:12.790 --> 13:14.979
I forgot who I am. Who am I?

13:15.709 --> 13:17.795
You're you. We're having lunch
with Art Corevelay.

13:18.003 --> 13:20.506
- Vandalay.
- Corevelay.

13:20.714 --> 13:23.321
Let me be the architect.
I can do it. I can do it.

13:23.634 --> 13:25.928
Hey, hey...

13:26.345 --> 13:27.701
Pamela's birthday party.

13:28.326 --> 13:31.559
- Didn't I see you there? Jerry.
- Sure. Hi.

13:34.165 --> 13:36.146
- This is George. I'm sorry.
- Vanessa.

13:36.355 --> 13:37.919
Nice to meet you.

13:38.128 --> 13:40.630
Sagman, Bennett, Robbins,
Oppenheim and Taff.

13:41.151 --> 13:43.133
That's right. What are you doing here?

13:44.071 --> 13:46.261
Meeting a friend for lunch.
Works in the building.

13:46.469 --> 13:48.033
Yeah, Art Vandalay.

13:48.138 --> 13:49.702
Oh, really?

13:49.806 --> 13:51.057
Which company?

13:51.474 --> 13:54.498
- I don't know. He's an importer.
- I don't really know...

13:54.707 --> 13:56.584
- Importer.
- And exporter.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.503
He's an importer-exporter.

14:00.129 --> 14:01.380
I'm...

14:01.589 --> 14:03.778
I'm an architect.

14:05.968 --> 14:08.366
Really? Well, what do you design?

14:11.390 --> 14:13.371
Railroads.

14:14.101 --> 14:15.978
I thought engineers do that.

14:16.395 --> 14:18.689
They can.

14:19.002 --> 14:21.296
I'm sorry you had to leave
so early the other night.

14:21.504 --> 14:24.215
Me too. My cousin
had to go back to Boston.

14:24.320 --> 14:28.073
- Oh, that guy was your cousin.
- Yeah.

14:28.178 --> 14:30.055
- And that woman was your...
- Friend.

14:32.348 --> 14:35.268
I'll just get a paper.

14:36.624 --> 14:38.396
So...

14:38.813 --> 14:40.586
... do you date immature men?

14:41.629 --> 14:43.923
Almost exclusively.

14:52.473 --> 14:54.245
I have no letters.

14:58.416 --> 15:01.232
Ma, will you go already?

15:03.943 --> 15:06.549
- What are you doing?
- I just want to see something.

15:06.758 --> 15:09.573
You can't look in there.
We're playing.

15:10.824 --> 15:12.076
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:12.284 --> 15:15.204
- Good evening, Mr. Kramer.
- Hey, Morty.

15:15.412 --> 15:17.081
- Salad dressing?
- Look.

15:17.289 --> 15:19.270
- "Quo. " Is that a word?
- Maybe.

15:19.479 --> 15:21.877
- Will you challenge it?
- Ma, you can't look up words...

15:22.086 --> 15:24.380
... in the dictionary.
Dad, she's cheating.

15:24.588 --> 15:26.465
"Quo"? That's not a word.

15:27.508 --> 15:30.115
- You're such a stickler.
- Well, put something down.

15:30.219 --> 15:32.826
You're taking 20 minutes on this.

15:32.930 --> 15:35.954
So Uncle Mac and Artie, they're all
coming here before the wedding?

15:36.162 --> 15:37.414
They'll be here at 2:00.

15:38.143 --> 15:41.897
Oh, Elaine called. She said she'd
be here at 2:30 and she says:

15:42.001 --> 15:45.860
"Hope your meeting went well
with Art Vandalay. "

15:50.135 --> 15:52.846
- She said what?
- Just what I said. Here.

15:56.599 --> 15:58.372
She knows.

15:58.581 --> 16:02.334
Oh, I am such a jackass.

16:02.543 --> 16:05.671
- She knows what?
- She knows the whole stupid thing.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.756
Vanessa and the elevator.

16:07.965 --> 16:10.155
No, no, that won't do.
He may have a Z.

16:10.259 --> 16:12.032
So how did she find out?

16:12.240 --> 16:15.681
Because Vanessa
probably told Pamela...

16:16.724 --> 16:19.643
... and Pamela probably told Elaine.

16:20.060 --> 16:22.667
So, what are you, afraid of her?

16:22.771 --> 16:25.378
Yes. Yes, I am.

16:25.691 --> 16:28.506
- What else did she say on the phone?
- Whatever I wrote down.

16:29.862 --> 16:32.677
Yeah, but what was the tone
in her voice? How did she sound?

16:33.199 --> 16:34.971
Who am I, Rich Little?

16:36.327 --> 16:39.350
Well, she can't be too mad.

16:39.559 --> 16:42.583
- She's still coming to the wedding.
- Yeah, but now I'm nervous.

16:42.687 --> 16:44.773
Oh, stop it.

16:49.569 --> 16:53.010
- "Quone"?
- Thirty, 31, 32...

16:53.219 --> 16:54.678
"Quone"?

16:54.887 --> 16:57.598
No, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to challenge that.

16:57.702 --> 17:00.100
No, you don't have to
challenge that. That's a word.

17:00.205 --> 17:02.603
- That's a definite word.
- I am challenging.

17:02.707 --> 17:05.210
"Quone. " To "quone" something.

17:08.858 --> 17:10.319
I'm not playing with you anymore.

17:11.362 --> 17:13.030
"Quone's" not a word.

17:13.239 --> 17:15.428
No good. Sorry. There it is.

17:15.950 --> 17:17.305
Get it off.

17:17.826 --> 17:19.598
Why did you make me put that down?

17:19.703 --> 17:22.623
No. We need a medical dictionary.

17:22.830 --> 17:25.960
Like a patient gets difficult,
you quone him.

17:28.879 --> 17:32.216
You want some funny material? You
ought to come down to where I work.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.344
There's a sitcom.

17:35.553 --> 17:38.785
You must have quite
a time down there.

17:39.828 --> 17:42.747
- We got plenty of time.
- Sorry. I am just waiting for someone.

17:42.956 --> 17:46.605
Watch what you say to this guy.
He'll put it in his next act.

17:47.335 --> 17:49.108
- Yeah, yeah.
- Jerry, did I tell you...

17:49.316 --> 17:51.610
... that I'm writing a book,
an autobiography?

17:51.819 --> 17:53.279
Yeah, you mentioned it.

17:53.487 --> 17:56.198
It's based on all my experiences.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.596
That's perfect.

17:58.805 --> 18:00.578
- Could you excuse me one second?
- Sure.

18:00.682 --> 18:02.454
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.

18:08.398 --> 18:10.796
How do you do? Jerry Seinfeld.

18:11.005 --> 18:12.569
Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.

18:17.261 --> 18:19.138
You want to do this now,
or you wanna wait?

18:19.346 --> 18:20.806
Oh, no, let's do it now.

18:21.015 --> 18:23.100
The whole elevator business,
let me just explain.

18:23.309 --> 18:25.498
- Okay.
- Jerry, are you going with us?

18:25.603 --> 18:28.939
- No, I'm gonna take my car.
- That's why I brought the wagon.

18:29.148 --> 18:31.650
Why the hell
did I bring the wagon?

18:32.172 --> 18:34.361
Anyway, you know
why I didn't ask you?

18:34.466 --> 18:38.636
I mean, I felt so uncomfortable,
and you were so annoyed in the cab.

18:38.741 --> 18:41.660
Well, Jerry, I never saw you
flirt with anyone before.

18:41.869 --> 18:44.059
It was quite the spectacle.

18:44.163 --> 18:45.935
Jerry, we'll see you there.
Bye, Elaine.

18:46.144 --> 18:48.125
Oh, bye. Good to see you.

18:48.334 --> 18:49.793
Oh, we didn't meet.

18:49.898 --> 18:52.296
Sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin,
Artie Levine.

18:52.504 --> 18:54.381
- Levine.
- Artie.

18:54.486 --> 18:57.197
Artie! Come on.

18:58.552 --> 18:59.908
Yeah, Levine.

19:00.116 --> 19:03.036
And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp.

19:05.538 --> 19:09.396
Anyway, I admit it was a fairly
ridiculous thing to do...

19:09.501 --> 19:12.942
... but I mean, obviously
we have a little problem here.

19:13.150 --> 19:14.401
Yeah, obviously.

19:14.506 --> 19:18.155
If we're gonna be friends, we gotta
be able to talk about other people.

19:18.364 --> 19:20.345
- Couldn't agree more.
- Good.

19:21.179 --> 19:23.369
- Good.
- Good.

19:24.724 --> 19:26.810
Great.

19:27.227 --> 19:30.355
Great? Where do you get great?

19:31.085 --> 19:34.943
It's great to talk about...

19:36.507 --> 19:37.967
... other people.
- Guys.

19:38.175 --> 19:41.616
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:41.929 --> 19:43.389
Well, anybody specific?

19:44.431 --> 19:46.204
No.

19:46.517 --> 19:48.602
- A general guy.
- Oh, really?

19:48.707 --> 19:51.522
- Elaine Marie Benes.
- What?

19:51.730 --> 19:53.399
No, it's not a big deal.

19:53.607 --> 19:55.276
No, that's great. That's terrific.

19:55.380 --> 19:57.152
- No, we just met.
- Doesn't matter.

19:57.570 --> 20:00.906
What's the young man's name?
I would like to meet him.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.513
I don't think so.

20:03.617 --> 20:05.911
Well, what does he do?
Is he an artisan...

20:06.120 --> 20:09.039
... a craftsman,
a labourer of some sort?

20:09.248 --> 20:12.272
- Wall Street.
- High finance.

20:12.376 --> 20:14.879
Bulls, bears,
people from Connecticut.

20:17.590 --> 20:19.571
And he happens to be
pretty good-looking.

20:21.135 --> 20:22.490
All right, sir.

20:23.950 --> 20:26.244
And he's hilarious.

20:26.765 --> 20:29.685
- Now that's not fair.
- You know.

20:29.894 --> 20:31.562
So where did you meet this guy?

20:32.292 --> 20:34.690
I staked out his health club.

20:35.211 --> 20:36.775
When you're on a stakeout...

20:36.880 --> 20:39.904
... do you find it's better
to stand up against the wall...

20:40.008 --> 20:43.240
... or kind of crouch down
behind a big plant?

20:52.559 --> 20:54.644
You know, I think that...

20:55.270 --> 20:58.190
... even if you've had
a relationship with someone...

20:58.294 --> 21:01.526
... or, let's say, especially if you've had
a relationship with someone...

21:01.735 --> 21:04.342
... and you try and become
friends afterwards...

21:04.446 --> 21:06.114
... it's very difficult. Isn't this?

21:06.218 --> 21:10.181
It's hard because you
know each other so well.

21:10.389 --> 21:12.266
You know? You know all
each other's tricks.

21:12.370 --> 21:14.873
It's like two magicians trying
to entertain each other.

21:14.977 --> 21:18.627
You know, one goes, "Look, a rabbit. "
The other goes, "So?"

21:20.191 --> 21:22.485
"I believe that's your card. "

21:23.527 --> 21:28.428
"Look, why don't we just saw each
other in half and call it a night, okay?"
