00:00.145 --> 00:03.483
Tell me your secret recipe
for erasing Owen's addiction.

00:04.692 --> 00:08.167
Insert a protein that inhibits
dopamine beta-hydroxylase,

00:08.714 --> 00:10.919
right in the addiction
part of the brain.

00:10.999 --> 00:13.869
I do it once
and his genes do the work forever.

00:13.963 --> 00:15.088
Is this about Owen?

00:15.188 --> 00:18.151
Because Arroyo said, you try this
on human being, you should be arrested.

00:18.231 --> 00:20.226
You'd be jumping off a cliff, Owen.

00:20.436 --> 00:22.000
I can do what I want.

00:22.868 --> 00:24.517
Where are you Sinatra?

00:25.391 --> 00:27.612
The Boston patients
are all parents of infants.

00:28.243 --> 00:30.662
But somewhere in the world
it's a very common disease.

00:30.742 --> 00:33.690
It's so common
that every baby is exposed to it.

00:33.905 --> 00:35.837
Sinatra is Filipino virus C-2.

00:36.308 --> 00:38.700
There was a guy
from the Sinatra society who traveled...

00:38.926 --> 00:40.877
- to the Philippines.
- Tell me.

00:41.232 --> 00:44.006
Mark Smith, with a "k".
And he bought a ticket to Boston.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.123
He was killed
in a car accident 3 weeks ago.

00:46.203 --> 00:48.487
- What?
- Mark Smith did not bring it to Boston.

00:48.567 --> 00:50.701
I mean, this guy, he's not sick.

00:51.843 --> 00:54.348
- No, he's just dead.
- We've got the beginnings of a pandemic

00:54.435 --> 00:55.655
and we don't have a clue.

We have 14 upstairs in ICU.

01:07.804 --> 01:11.221
10 serious, 4 critical
and then we come to this group.

01:11.411 --> 01:13.086
The most recently infected.

01:13.166 --> 01:15.012
And it's spreading
much faster than we'd like.

01:15.092 --> 01:18.016
Dr. Serrano, Dr. SandstrÃ¶m.
Thank you for coming.

01:18.565 --> 01:21.404
Ladies, gentlemen,
this is the lead team from NorBAC.

01:21.629 --> 01:23.837
Did you hear
that Sinatra's broken out in Florida?

01:23.929 --> 01:27.307
- Big time in Tallahassee.
- Any links with us or at Boston?

01:27.609 --> 01:30.402
I'd get your epidemiologist
exchanging symptomology.

01:31.023 --> 01:32.139
We'll do.

01:32.319 --> 01:35.092
Do you mind finishing up the show
and tell for these new residents?

01:35.407 --> 01:37.332
We're pulling up
all the help we can get.

01:37.412 --> 01:40.080
There's a conference room
just down the hall, they'll show you.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.172
Sure.

01:41.606 --> 01:43.052
- After you.
- Go ahead.

01:43.624 --> 01:47.255
Okay, we think the Sinatra virus
hides out in the body's organs

01:47.347 --> 01:49.884
and pops up to trigger
a lethal immune response.

01:49.967 --> 01:51.478
You all up to speed with that?

01:52.240 --> 01:54.946
We're using a regimen
of immunosuppressants.

01:55.026 --> 01:57.042
Get that? We're turning down
their immune systems.

01:57.122 --> 01:58.883
Just trying to stabilize them.

01:58.963 --> 02:00.556
This is a hospital right?

02:00.636 --> 02:02.186
I mean, new bugs walk in every hour.

02:02.266 --> 02:04.131
They're susceptible to staph infections,

02:04.211 --> 02:07.709
C. difficile, E.coli, rotavirus, crypto.

02:07.789 --> 02:10.559
They're human Petri dishes, right?
They could die of something else.

02:10.723 --> 02:12.917
But right now we're just trying
to keep them alive.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.362
That ladies and gentlemen is a snapshot
of science in the 21st century.

02:17.442 --> 02:19.417
Knowing just enough
to know how little you know.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.065
Let's get back to work.

02:31.010 --> 02:34.151
- What?
- Here's where we are on the antivirals.

02:34.285 --> 02:37.529
- <i>Shoot.</i>
- Now that I'm sure it's a beta-herpes,

02:37.609 --> 02:40.415
I'm testing combinations
with Idoxuridine and Docosanol.

02:40.495 --> 02:43.193
<i>Stanford's trying combos
of Cidofovir and Foscarnet.</i>

02:43.273 --> 02:45.557
Yeah and Boston's all over Tromantadine.

02:45.662 --> 02:47.804
- Hear anything back from them yet?
- No.

02:47.884 --> 02:50.012
What I'd like to do is get
some next generation drugs

02:50.092 --> 02:52.863
that are in the pipeline in Switzerland.
Supposedly very promising.

02:52.943 --> 02:55.085
- Need any help?
<i>- I'm trying my own channels</i>

02:55.165 --> 02:56.938
<i>but if you've got anything, go for it.</i>

02:57.018 --> 03:00.366
I'll make some calls. We're sending you
blood and tissue sample from Mark Smith.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.339
You want
SNPs and virus detection analysis?

03:02.476 --> 03:05.284
- All the organs.
- Still think he's our smoking gun?

03:05.415 --> 03:07.821
Enough that I'll be
on the next flight home.

It's been
a long 6 months.

04:48.108 --> 04:49.777
Yes it has.

04:50.519 --> 04:52.438
I see you missed
a couple of rehabs.

04:52.518 --> 04:55.507
Yeah, I've been real busy
but I'm feeling good, Gordon.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.946
- You look good.
- Thanks.

04:58.028 --> 05:00.972
So any...
post-traumatic stress?

05:01.052 --> 05:03.246
- Nightmares, flashbacks?
- Not really.

05:16.284 --> 05:17.296
Yes.

05:20.740 --> 05:23.829
The problem with post-traumatic stress
is that is pops up in disguise.

05:24.447 --> 05:26.839
The phantom figure in a dream.
We don't always

05:26.931 --> 05:28.498
make an immediate connection.

05:28.603 --> 05:30.456
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

05:31.356 --> 05:33.221
Inappropriate anger,
irrational fears,

05:33.301 --> 05:34.707
night sweats,
these things.

05:34.787 --> 05:37.849
Yeah, I'm going with the key
to happiness is a bad memory.

05:38.756 --> 05:41.406
It's okay to get past it Mayko,
it's not okay to hide from it.

05:43.912 --> 05:45.568
What's this
about your legs?

05:46.291 --> 05:47.895
I've had some pain.

05:47.987 --> 05:50.905
You told the physio
it felt like white-hot needles.

05:51.549 --> 05:53.913
That's something. How often are you
getting this sensation?

05:53.993 --> 05:57.141
It's not a sensation.
My left leg feels like it's on fire.

05:57.469 --> 05:59.723
- Any specific time of day?
- No, it's random.

06:02.940 --> 06:04.747
What about body image issues?

06:04.931 --> 06:07.323
Gordon, you know how I feel
about this psychobabble stuff.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.433
You been intimate with anyone
since the accident?

06:09.630 --> 06:10.891
What does that have to do?

06:10.971 --> 06:14.330
How you feel about yourself emotionally,
physically, they are connected.

06:16.047 --> 06:18.439
- I just want you to think about it.
- Okay.

06:21.653 --> 06:22.980
In the meantime...

06:25.004 --> 06:27.278
Why don't you try this
for a couple weeks?

06:33.362 --> 06:36.240
Benzodiazepine?
I don't need anti-anxiety meds.

06:36.322 --> 06:39.337
- I'm trying to treat your pain.
- And you think it's all in my head?

06:41.547 --> 06:45.306
It's real Gordon. Okay? So can you
write me up a Percocet or something?

06:46.416 --> 06:48.716
- You think that'll help?
- Yeah, I'm in pain.

06:49.715 --> 06:50.727
Okay.

06:56.654 --> 06:58.980
I want you to keep me
a pain journal though.

06:59.269 --> 07:01.753
Where you are
and what you're feeling when you...

07:01.977 --> 07:04.211
go through
one of these white-hot needles episodes?

07:04.457 --> 07:06.881
Sure. I'll just write
a little note down while

07:06.961 --> 07:08.800
I'm on the floor screaming and crying.

07:09.136 --> 07:10.832
Punctuation isn't important.

07:19.176 --> 07:20.182
Bob?

07:20.353 --> 07:23.152
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Yep. What's up?</i>

07:23.980 --> 07:25.886
I could use a second opinion in here.

07:25.966 --> 07:27.128
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

07:29.695 --> 07:31.009
What are you?

07:35.577 --> 07:38.876
So I'm doing a PCR on these organs
we got in from San Francisco.

07:39.033 --> 07:42.032
- Mark Smith.
- There's one organ I can't recognize.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.594
That's a gallbladder.

07:43.674 --> 07:45.317
Half a gallbladder actually.

07:45.481 --> 07:46.959
You can tell by the cystic duct.

07:47.104 --> 07:48.142
Testicle.

07:48.239 --> 07:50.486
They usually come in pairs.
They're not considered vital

07:50.585 --> 07:52.929
compared to a lung or heart or a liver.

07:53.025 --> 07:55.930
Right.
But this one's really got me stumped.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.676
What the hell is that?

08:00.763 --> 08:01.933
Could you...

08:02.695 --> 08:04.745
rotate to the left?

08:08.767 --> 08:09.871
I don't know.

08:11.364 --> 08:12.910
Are you sure it's an organ?

08:13.865 --> 08:14.903
Mystery meat.

08:15.485 --> 08:17.596
I don't know. I'll set it aside for now.

08:17.954 --> 08:18.966
Thanks.

08:20.898 --> 08:21.936
Sure.

09:03.723 --> 09:07.285
Just keep on it Rachel.
We need those organ PCRs.

09:07.666 --> 09:09.059
Put on a pot of coffee.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.338
Hey there Owen. You look like shit.

09:13.455 --> 09:14.467
Hi.

09:15.742 --> 09:17.715
- Hi.
- Hey, it's David.

09:18.385 --> 09:19.411
I know.

09:20.068 --> 09:21.369
How you doing?

09:21.684 --> 09:22.709
Good.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.575
Not good, Owen. You're doing great.

09:26.202 --> 09:28.558
Show David how you can walk. Come on.

09:38.432 --> 09:39.773
That's great Owen.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.984
Can I see you outside for a second?

09:46.790 --> 09:49.635
Would you like anything? Snack or juice?

10:01.108 --> 10:03.296
That is everything
you didn't want to talk about.

10:03.696 --> 10:04.708
What?

10:04.827 --> 10:06.260
It's like he's got Parkinson's.

10:06.417 --> 10:07.797
Because it's working.

10:07.903 --> 10:11.188
The dopamine pathways
responsible for his addictive behaviours

10:11.268 --> 10:13.000
are shutting down as predicted.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.385
It looks like
everything is shutting down.

10:16.940 --> 10:19.259
Well, we still have
lots of tweaking to do. It's been less

10:19.339 --> 10:21.199
than 72 hours, David.

10:21.641 --> 10:23.428
Parkinson's specialist
is coming on Friday.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.072
Great! You're gonna put him
on Levodopa, the rest of his life?

10:26.944 --> 10:27.945
David.

10:28.484 --> 10:31.044
This is the kind of pioneering science

10:31.124 --> 10:33.929
you used to rhapsodize about
when I sat in your lecture...

10:34.009 --> 10:37.925
I never rhapsodized about
shoddy half thought out experiments.

10:38.008 --> 10:40.985
- This is a perfectible procedure.
- Fine! Perfect it on lab rats.

10:41.065 --> 10:43.069
- Owen is a human being.
- Exactly.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.459
Eventually all new procedures
have to been tried in people.

10:46.539 --> 10:48.037
He's a fucking zombie!

10:48.549 --> 10:51.638
Alright? Now that used to be
a beautifully screwed up teenager.

10:52.203 --> 10:54.043
Wasn't that the whole problem?

10:54.549 --> 10:56.138
I never should've let you do this.

10:56.218 --> 10:57.815
- Let me?!
- I could've stopped you.

11:03.671 --> 11:06.036
That's fine. I'll take him.
Thank you. Come here.

11:06.608 --> 11:09.052
That's enough for today.
Let's get you back in bed okay?

11:16.253 --> 11:18.895
<i>That's it. You're doing great.</i>

11:29.352 --> 11:30.364
What?

11:30.469 --> 11:33.571
<i>It's Carl Riddlemeyer, David.
Have I got you at a bad time?</i>

11:34.405 --> 11:35.912
- Always.
- What? I'm afraid

11:35.992 --> 11:37.607
I lost you there for a minute.

11:37.791 --> 11:40.828
- What can I do for you, Carlton?
<i>- I'm calling with good news.</i>

11:41.248 --> 11:43.561
I'm sending NorBAC
a new electron microscope.

11:44.014 --> 11:46.196
Top of the line, Zeiss Optics.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.713
- Why?
- Call it an olive branch.

11:48.811 --> 11:52.166
I'm new to this job. I'm finally
understanding what NorBAC is about.

11:52.246 --> 11:53.749
What hit you on the head?

11:53.834 --> 11:56.988
Well David,
as you once reminded me yourself,

11:57.087 --> 12:00.306
clearly, my distinguished advisors don't
have a fucking clue what they're doing.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.607
- Maybe on the golf course.
- Well anyway...

12:02.994 --> 12:04.784
When I'm wrong
I own it and I change course.

12:04.876 --> 12:06.287
Hope the Zeiss helps out.

12:06.677 --> 12:07.677
Yeah well...

12:10.429 --> 12:11.441
Thanks.

12:12.847 --> 12:13.886
Weird.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.018
This is the Tallahassee update.

12:20.098 --> 12:23.029
Okay, good. Listen, did you clean up
my shit in Washington?

12:23.134 --> 12:25.347
That incident with you
and Riddlemeyer at Camp Dalton?

12:25.427 --> 12:28.243
Yeah, I put on my rubber gloves
and did some heavy scrubbing.

12:28.323 --> 12:29.550
You're welcome.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.626
- Where's Rachel?
- Waiting for Mark Smith's PCR results.

12:32.707 --> 12:34.272
Ok, let's get started.

12:34.571 --> 12:38.206
Tallahassee: 6 dead, 16 sick.

12:38.288 --> 12:41.036
3 new fatalities in Boston,
5 in San Francisco.

12:41.118 --> 12:43.997
Alright! Mark Smith had
Sinatra traces in his blood,

12:44.077 --> 12:45.827
concentration in 1 kidney.

12:45.922 --> 12:48.172
Guess we're still in business.
So what've we got?

12:48.252 --> 12:50.162
Our swinger
Pete Braungart's immune system

12:50.244 --> 12:52.215
was weakened because he had CGD.

12:52.311 --> 12:54.794
Babies in Boston and the Philippines

12:54.890 --> 12:58.263
get the virus but they don't die from it
because of their immature immune system.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.163
And now our new best friend Mark Smith

13:00.245 --> 13:02.746
carried the virus in his kidney
but it did not manifest.

13:02.828 --> 13:03.922
Why not?

13:04.557 --> 13:07.471
San Francisco medical records
confirm he did not have CGD,

13:07.567 --> 13:09.152
was not on Interferon.

13:10.054 --> 13:11.216
What else?

13:11.940 --> 13:13.761
Uh, childhood immunity.

13:13.949 --> 13:16.368
He didn't look Filipino,
where was he from?

13:16.819 --> 13:18.049
Toledo.

13:18.145 --> 13:21.398
Maybe he spent part of his childhood in
the Philippines and developed immunity.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.777
- Get on that. Look into his history.
- No need. Rachel I want you

13:24.859 --> 13:26.827
to check for antibodies
to any tropical diseases.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.342
That'll let us know
if he was there or not.

13:29.478 --> 13:30.561
Other reasons?

13:30.755 --> 13:32.462
Maybe his immune system was weak.

13:32.559 --> 13:34.718
Undiagnosed HIV/AIDS.

13:34.869 --> 13:36.502
I'll look into that too.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.498
If it was that serious,
he'd be medicated.

13:38.607 --> 13:41.008
Bob I want you to look
for meds in his system.

13:41.145 --> 13:43.190
There was nothing indicated
in his medical records.

13:43.273 --> 13:45.983
No, check him Bob.
Maybe he didn't tell anybody.

13:46.147 --> 13:47.995
Now have we been able
to connect him to any

13:48.104 --> 13:50.455
of the patients in Florida or Boston?

13:50.701 --> 13:52.480
No, not yet.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.790
And what was he doing
in the Philippines?

13:54.899 --> 13:58.121
I'll keep crosschecking patient
profiles for Tallahassee and Bean Town.

13:58.214 --> 14:00.195
I'll chase down
the Philippines connection.

14:00.318 --> 14:02.696
Very good. Rachel,

14:03.954 --> 14:05.801
I want you on diseases.

14:05.938 --> 14:08.487
Bob, you're on meds.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.987
Carlos...

14:10.096 --> 14:12.002
I'd like to take another
look at that virus.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.761
Let's get to work.

14:39.058 --> 14:41.504
Test these blood samples for
antibodies to

14:41.613 --> 14:43.490
Dengue, Malaria, HIV.

14:57.525 --> 14:59.821
Yes, any drugs or toxins.

15:00.436 --> 15:01.465
Thank you.

15:02.063 --> 15:04.753
And we'll need the results
as soon as possible.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.278
Thanks, have a good day.

15:06.401 --> 15:09.271
<i>I'm here in Sutter Washington
with Dr. Joanna Sabean,</i>

15:09.394 --> 15:12.715
<i>regional case officer for
the Centre for Disease Control.</i>

15:12.825 --> 15:17.078
<i>Dr. Sabean, I understand that mayor
Alice Walker called in the CDC,</i>

15:17.201 --> 15:19.366
<i>saying it was raining dead birds.</i>

15:19.475 --> 15:21.745
<i>We're testing 20 birds for avian flu</i>

15:21.854 --> 15:24.423
<i>but H5N1 is rarely found in wild fowl.</i>

15:24.533 --> 15:26.925
- Exactly.
<i>- So it's little likelihood...</i>

15:27.048 --> 15:28.251
What's going on?

15:28.387 --> 15:31.258
<i>But if it is, could this be
the start of something bigger,</i>

15:31.381 --> 15:33.362
<i>something we don't know about?</i>

15:34.390 --> 15:36.222
Why is she trying
to scare people like that?

15:36.345 --> 15:38.832
- It's TV news, that's what they do.
- Mayko, Mayko!

15:38.969 --> 15:41.361
- The deliveries are here.
- What deliveries?

15:41.470 --> 15:43.356
- By a bike courier.
- Oh, he's here.

15:43.466 --> 15:45.431
- Yes.
- Oh sorry. Excuse me.

15:51.988 --> 15:53.422
Sign here please.

15:55.835 --> 15:57.326
- Hey! Milo.
- Hey.

16:01.171 --> 16:04.739
Are you expecting something?
Don't think this one is for you, is it?

16:04.876 --> 16:05.908
No.

16:08.909 --> 16:11.861
- Well, what?
- Sorry, sorry.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.567
No I'm just... I'm training
for the Muskoka Ironman, right?

16:14.663 --> 16:17.230
And so I'm on my bike,
like, 5 nights a week.

16:17.312 --> 16:18.910
I thought it might be fun to...

16:19.006 --> 16:21.694
Go for a ride after work,
together, sometime.

16:22.477 --> 16:25.867
So, after I've been on my bike all day,
I go for a bike ride just for fun?

16:25.963 --> 16:29.143
- Is that what you're saying?
- You could pace me.

16:30.094 --> 16:33.379
- I could do that I guess.
- I mean, you know, if you wanted to.

16:34.404 --> 16:38.133
- Have you ever done the Rouge Valley?
- No, downtown boy don't do valleys.

16:38.222 --> 16:41.329
I see. Well there's
a first time for everything.

16:43.188 --> 16:46.500
- What are we talking about?
- Tomorrow, after work?

16:48.395 --> 16:49.436
Cool.

16:51.936 --> 16:53.361
You know where to find me.

16:54.158 --> 16:56.221
Here. Right?
Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

16:56.330 --> 16:58.613
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay? Thank you.

17:16.315 --> 17:17.463
Sorry.

17:21.231 --> 17:23.936
- What's with Mayko?
- She's drooling over the bike courier.

17:24.031 --> 17:26.124
Can't say that I blame her.

17:26.957 --> 17:28.490
- Rachel.
- Yeah.

17:28.599 --> 17:30.513
What'd you get out of
those tissue samples?

17:30.622 --> 17:32.222
No HIV, no Hep-C.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.149
- Well that was expected.
- No signs of any

17:34.231 --> 17:36.144
prior infection with tropical diseases.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.439
So we can rule out
a childhood in the Philippines.

17:38.535 --> 17:41.282
Maybe we could figure out what
he was up to on his most recent visit.

17:41.362 --> 17:43.073
Wes is on it.
Philippine immigration says

17:43.155 --> 17:46.163
Mark Smith never registered in a hotel.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.105
So, what was he doing there?

17:48.187 --> 17:49.193
Exactly.

18:03.035 --> 18:04.421
- You got it?
- I got it.

18:04.511 --> 18:08.234
This is a SNPs analysis from
Mark Smith's pancreas...

18:08.316 --> 18:10.011
His gallbladder...

18:10.858 --> 18:12.348
And his kidney.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.859
No, that doesn't match his DNA.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.654
- They gave you the wrong guy's kidney.
- And they sent along this.

18:17.737 --> 18:20.258
Oh! Well that's a um...

18:20.835 --> 18:24.238
That's a polycystic kidney,
in very bad condition.

18:24.867 --> 18:27.064
Right! The surgeons leave them in.

18:27.436 --> 18:28.512
Good work!

18:29.280 --> 18:31.057
- Kidney transplant?
- That's what I said.

18:31.166 --> 18:34.036
So Mark Smith had a kidney transplant
from somebody who died of Sinatra?

18:34.132 --> 18:36.141
Don't think so.
The donor probably looked healthy.

18:36.237 --> 18:39.618
Whoever the donor was probably
had the disease as a child.

18:39.716 --> 18:41.944
He looked healthy but
he was carrying a dormant virus.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.655
- But it woke up in Mark Smith.
- So why wasn't he sick?

18:44.737 --> 18:46.391
He probably had mild symptoms like cold

18:46.473 --> 18:48.605
but the immunosuppressants
that were keeping his body

18:48.701 --> 18:50.274
from rejecting the kidney transplant

18:50.356 --> 18:52.068
kept his immune system
from overreacting.

18:52.148 --> 18:53.861
He was just sick
enough to infect others.

18:53.957 --> 18:56.903
I don't see how the person who did
the transplant didn't notice the virus.

18:56.985 --> 18:59.103
It's impossible to see
without a DNA or an RNA test.

18:59.185 --> 19:02.573
- So Mark Smith is patient zero?
- No, the donor is patient zero.

19:02.669 --> 19:04.186
If this was a multiple donor then

19:04.282 --> 19:06.499
that would explain outbreaks
in Boston and Tallahassee.

19:06.759 --> 19:08.784
- A liver here, a lung there.
- That makes sense.

19:09.042 --> 19:10.833
Now we've just got
to back it up with facts.

19:10.928 --> 19:12.925
I want you to run a
mitochondrial DNA analysis of

19:13.007 --> 19:16.105
Mark Smith's kidney transplant. Look
for geographical and ethnic origins.

19:16.187 --> 19:17.267
Right.

19:17.389 --> 19:20.316
- Where's Bob with the toxicology tests?
- He's not back yet.

19:20.601 --> 19:22.924
I'll check the transplant lists
in Boston and Tallahassee.

19:23.006 --> 19:26.184
Katarina was the first to die. She
must've known a transplant recipient.

19:26.293 --> 19:27.546
If she did, I'll find 'em.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.341
Mayko, I need you to check the patients.

19:29.437 --> 19:31.799
See if they had any contact
with a transplant recipient.

19:31.895 --> 19:34.178
We might have a dozen
more human time bombs

19:34.273 --> 19:35.941
out there ready to go off.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.239
Alright.

19:54.664 --> 19:56.139
What's the time?

19:56.905 --> 19:59.173
- 3 minutes, 10.
- Oh shit, I've gotta break 3.

19:59.269 --> 20:02.071
Hey Mayko, don't kill me
in the process okay.

20:02.180 --> 20:03.205
Sorry.

20:08.336 --> 20:10.158
What's that? There.

20:10.238 --> 20:12.307
Oh, it's Golani Brigade.

20:13.209 --> 20:15.462
- You were in the Israeli army?
- Yeah.

20:15.557 --> 20:18.127
Before university when I was 18,
I went over there.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.421
After basic training I spent a year
in the occupied territories.

20:21.516 --> 20:23.360
Kind of came back a different person.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.633
Like?

20:24.987 --> 20:28.271
Like I applied to the Munk Centre
for International Relations.

20:28.414 --> 20:31.646
- And give up being a bike courier.
- I know, you know.

20:31.726 --> 20:34.314
Most people, they don't see past
the bike courier. You know.

20:34.417 --> 20:35.968
They look at me and think I'm...

20:36.063 --> 20:39.262
I don't know, like some
kind of monkey or something like that.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.837
Well quit whining monkey. I'm still
trying to find a life outside of work.

20:42.946 --> 20:44.436
Okay, let's ride.

20:45.802 --> 20:46.824
Hang on.

21:00.457 --> 21:02.470
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's okay.

21:03.628 --> 21:04.636
Oh fuck.

21:14.335 --> 21:17.365
- What happened?
- I just got... I just slipped.

21:26.690 --> 21:28.453
It's from the bomb.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.770
- You want me to help you out?
- No. It's okay. I'm okay.

21:55.531 --> 21:56.770
I had no idea.

21:59.590 --> 22:02.659
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. It's... Why?

22:02.795 --> 22:05.994
My God, people were blown
to bits. This is...

22:06.117 --> 22:07.684
This is nothing.

22:08.258 --> 22:09.544
I'm never really

22:09.667 --> 22:11.805
quite sure how to
mention it though, you know?

22:11.915 --> 22:15.933
Hi, I think you're hot and
I've got an amputated leg.

22:23.057 --> 22:24.493
This is not...

22:25.505 --> 22:27.801
Is this too weird for you?

22:28.894 --> 22:30.042
Too weird?

22:31.757 --> 22:34.408
No. No. After what I saw
in the army this is...

22:34.490 --> 22:36.963
this is normal tuesday afternoon stuff.

22:42.455 --> 22:44.353
- You wanna get up?
- Yeah.

22:44.491 --> 22:45.545
Thank you.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.503
You good?

23:05.981 --> 23:09.192
- What's up?
- So, I did both a Y-DNA,

23:09.302 --> 23:11.803
and MT-DNA haplotype tests.

23:11.899 --> 23:14.895
Both the R1A1 and HVR2
haplogroups suggest

23:14.991 --> 23:17.273
that the kidney came from
a male of Asian origin.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.815
- There you go.
- And Bob found Rapamune,

23:19.938 --> 23:23.180
which is an immunosuppressant used
by transplant patients in the blood.

23:23.289 --> 23:26.446
- So it's transplant tourism eh?
- Looks like it. Another thing.

23:26.669 --> 23:29.870
Mayko found that 2 of the sick people
in Tallahassee had the same dentist.

23:29.979 --> 23:32.454
He was on sick leave for 2 months
and just recently came back.

23:32.562 --> 23:34.037
- Did they pick him up yet?
- No.

23:34.117 --> 23:36.362
His wife wants us to talk to her lawyer.

23:36.460 --> 23:37.947
Don't dentists take precautions?

23:38.057 --> 23:40.251
But masks and gloves are
useless if you're not trained

23:40.342 --> 23:42.707
to put them on properly
like, not use your hands.

23:42.816 --> 23:44.264
What have you got Wes?

23:44.370 --> 23:47.477
I had the FBI check
into Mark Smith's credit card records.

23:47.587 --> 23:49.922
- Remind me to tell you about the birds.
- Birds?

23:50.289 --> 23:52.576
- A favour for a friend of mine.
- Okay.

23:52.835 --> 23:55.366
4 months ago there was a 15,000$ deposit

23:55.462 --> 23:57.357
to a transplantfacilitator.com.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.323
- 15,000 bucks?
- That's just the deposit.

23:59.428 --> 24:01.561
For $140 000 they will
find you a new kidney.

24:01.645 --> 24:04.043
- You want a heart, that's 290.
- Is that legal?

24:04.123 --> 24:06.388
Well it's just a service
so technically, yes.

24:06.472 --> 24:08.422
As long as you're not
buying an actual organ.

24:08.502 --> 24:09.977
Alright. How do we...

24:10.431 --> 24:13.118
contact transplantfacilitator.com?

24:13.258 --> 24:15.564
- They're in Vegas.
- Figures. Call them.

24:15.663 --> 24:18.196
- I'd like to sit with him face to face.
- Why?

24:18.280 --> 24:20.958
Because the last time
I called him he hung up on me.

24:22.826 --> 24:23.881
Oldsquaw.

24:23.961 --> 24:26.514
You can tell by the black and white head
and the markings,

24:26.594 --> 24:29.493
- the short beak and the pointed tail.
- Beautiful.

24:30.893 --> 24:32.740
I love the smell of formaldehyde.

24:33.692 --> 24:35.511
Reminds me of my marriage.

24:35.999 --> 24:37.414
What do you mean?

24:39.546 --> 24:41.567
Nothing, it's a dumb joke.

24:42.855 --> 24:45.044
I'm just in the middle of
a very messy break-up.

24:45.128 --> 24:46.180
I can relate.

24:46.260 --> 24:49.298
My mom and I didn't
speak for a month once.

24:52.402 --> 24:54.248
So parasites, what kind?

24:54.526 --> 24:55.528
Rice breast.

24:56.327 --> 24:57.504
Sarcocystosis.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.603
You guys see this CDC bulletin?

25:01.062 --> 25:02.816
No new reported cases of Sinatra.

25:02.896 --> 25:05.014
- We contained it.
- For now we have.

25:05.154 --> 25:07.141
So, we can focus on a vaccine?

25:07.260 --> 25:09.367
Focus on a vaccine.
What's with the birds?

25:09.645 --> 25:11.940
Carlos wants us to do a virus check.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.067
- From Washington State.
- What?

25:14.157 --> 25:17.406
A friend of his wants us to check
for any type-A avian virus jumpers,

25:17.486 --> 25:18.902
2000 candidates.

25:19.046 --> 25:20.061
What friend?

25:21.635 --> 25:23.985
I don't know. He said he
was talking to you about this.

25:24.097 --> 25:27.539
Right! Yeah. The birds, the birds.
He never got around to it.

25:28.929 --> 25:30.356
Hey Bob, you in tonight?

25:30.447 --> 25:32.909
- Totally in.
- You play poker, Rachel?

25:35.211 --> 25:36.337
You like ribs?

25:36.645 --> 25:38.016
If you cook 'em right.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.227
Give her directions to my place.
See you tonight.

25:40.345 --> 25:41.969
Okay. That's very interesting.

25:42.086 --> 25:44.689
He didn't even ask you
to bring the baked beans.

25:45.870 --> 25:48.249
- You make coleslaw?
- To die for.

25:50.964 --> 25:51.980
It's gonna be fun.

25:52.309 --> 25:54.249
Mayko, I thought
we were here to play poker.

25:54.329 --> 25:57.880
But listen to me! Every 30 seconds
an African kid dies of Malaria.

25:57.960 --> 25:58.987
- Ok?
- Yes.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.918
Do you know that
that is a million a year?

26:01.002 --> 26:03.931
Nations' wars, they're about
as irrelevant as a sports page.

26:04.011 --> 26:06.908
Come on. The Middle East
could blow sky-high tomorrow!

26:06.988 --> 26:08.823
It's a regional hiccup.

26:09.164 --> 26:13.148
Sorry, 5 million kids a year
die of diarrhea,

26:13.234 --> 26:16.746
measles, easy stuff to cure.
That is the real problem in the world.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.344
- Is Iran building a nuclear bomb?
- I don't know, but

26:19.433 --> 26:23.004
global warming is causing
hurricanes and floods and crop failures.

26:23.139 --> 26:25.931
And huge refugee populations
that are vulnerable to pandemics!

26:26.011 --> 26:28.457
- Right.
- I am talking about a massive die-off

26:28.537 --> 26:30.919
that will change
the course of life on this planet.

26:30.999 --> 26:32.756
- Right. So am I!
- Global pestilence!

26:32.836 --> 26:34.139
Right. Global warfare!

26:36.782 --> 26:39.006
We're dealing with a lit
fuse here. I need the names

26:39.086 --> 26:41.656
of every person you sent
to the Philippines for a transplant.

26:41.736 --> 26:44.897
I'm bound by the confidentiality
agreements I sign with all my clients.

26:44.977 --> 26:46.859
Just give me the name
of the clinic in Manila.

26:47.031 --> 26:49.859
I don't send people to clinics.
I send them to a broker

26:49.960 --> 26:51.450
who makes the local arrangements.

26:51.530 --> 26:53.726
What kind of a bullshit
business are you running?

26:53.806 --> 26:57.265
Well we've created a very efficient
market that matches buyers and sellers.

27:01.654 --> 27:02.683
Hit me.

27:03.224 --> 27:04.683
So what's with the birds?

27:04.790 --> 27:06.743
A friend of mine from the CDC.

27:08.099 --> 27:10.566
Hit me. I put a report on your desk.

27:12.634 --> 27:15.702
<i>- Carlos, cuida tu lenguaje.</i>
- Oh, excuse me.

27:18.259 --> 27:20.821
- Carl called after you left.
- How's the divorce going?

27:20.901 --> 27:24.060
- It reminds her of formaldehyde.
- No this was strictly business.

27:24.140 --> 27:26.519
He wants me to hand
over all the Sinatra data to

27:26.599 --> 27:28.865
Klay BioMedical in Baltimore.

27:30.588 --> 27:32.197
It's a pretty good vaccine lab.

27:32.283 --> 27:34.686
He used to sit
on the board of directors.

27:35.913 --> 27:38.416
Carlton called to 'nice' me
on the telephone the other day.

27:38.496 --> 27:41.109
Well, sure. 3 major
cities need the vaccine now,

27:41.198 --> 27:43.970
so there's a pile of cash in it
for whoever gets it out there.

27:46.416 --> 27:47.875
Give him all our data.

27:49.939 --> 27:52.213
You want me to copy Jenner Pharma,

27:52.303 --> 27:53.419
Norton Rab?

27:53.869 --> 27:55.778
That's a good idea.

27:56.555 --> 27:58.070
May the best lab win.

27:58.404 --> 28:00.700
Here's how it's gonna go down, Regis.

28:00.871 --> 28:03.081
I've got CNN on my speed dial.

28:03.192 --> 28:07.128
I'll call my contacts at the NY Times
and I will have this story planted:

28:08.130 --> 28:11.128
"Go to the Philippines
with Transplantfacilitator.

28:11.208 --> 28:14.680
"Get a black market organ and
watch your family die a terrible death."

28:14.896 --> 28:17.170
Look, Skip, you don't scare me.

28:17.325 --> 28:18.419
I'm not finished.

28:18.664 --> 28:20.475
It's totally corrupt and disgusting.

28:20.555 --> 28:22.070
It's supply and demand, Carlos.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.260
Bare-knuckle capitalism.
Kidney, who's got a kidney?

28:25.340 --> 28:26.522
I heard that in Manila,

28:26.602 --> 28:28.588
when cops shoot a criminal,
they harvest organs

28:28.668 --> 28:30.903
- before contacting next-of-kin.
- Come on.

28:30.983 --> 28:34.220
What about the thousands of helpless
people on waiting lists for organs?

28:34.300 --> 28:36.070
I mean, 15% of them die.

28:36.150 --> 28:38.547
- Well, thus the grey market.
- Black market.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.121
Then I'm gonna get
a top class action lawyer

28:41.334 --> 28:44.612
and I am gonna put him in touch
with the families of all the victims.

28:44.771 --> 28:46.820
You'll never stop
people in poor countries

28:46.900 --> 28:48.841
from selling their organs to the rich.

28:49.326 --> 28:51.684
A healthy lung will feed
a family of 5 for months.

28:51.764 --> 28:54.045
Spoken like a true
compassionate conservative.

28:54.125 --> 28:56.526
How do we help
the poor we buy their organs?

28:56.606 --> 28:57.974
Well, the price is right.

28:58.054 --> 29:00.334
There are victims in 3 states.

29:00.791 --> 29:04.306
That's 6 senators and a whole
busload of congressmen.

29:04.734 --> 29:06.588
I'll make sure that
there are public hearings.

29:08.157 --> 29:09.942
It's gonna cost your company...

29:10.426 --> 29:12.760
millions of dollars to fight this.

29:16.153 --> 29:19.178
How do you regulate people in India
who get hit on the head and wake up with

29:19.258 --> 29:22.320
- a scar where their kidney used to be?
- How do you feel about women selling

29:22.400 --> 29:24.411
their placentas for stem cell research?

29:24.501 --> 29:25.796
Well, that's out of bounds.

29:26.359 --> 29:27.703
Hypocrites!

29:27.808 --> 29:30.031
- It's a theological issue.
- Faith-based science?

29:30.111 --> 29:32.545
Not in my shop.
A cell is a cell is a cell.

29:33.118 --> 29:34.723
Not in the eyes of the Creator.

29:36.573 --> 29:38.272
- Are you done?
- I am.

29:43.773 --> 29:45.485
The king of kings holds.

29:46.343 --> 29:48.076
You're gonna go down, Reg.

29:48.848 --> 29:50.153
I promise you that.

29:51.392 --> 29:52.748
The question is:

29:52.992 --> 29:54.420
Do you wanna go down hard

29:55.244 --> 29:56.948
or would you like me in your corner

29:57.028 --> 29:59.281
to help you down smoothly?
Keep it simple.

30:00.594 --> 30:02.911
- This is really depressing, isn't it?
- Come here.

30:07.132 --> 30:08.213
See,

30:08.560 --> 30:10.482
I kind of find it oddly arousing.

30:14.873 --> 30:15.885
Mayko?

30:18.275 --> 30:19.785
I don't really feel like poker.

30:25.758 --> 30:26.788
Mayko!

30:29.489 --> 30:31.017
What do you have, Rachel?

30:31.466 --> 30:32.472
21!

30:33.080 --> 30:34.302
Divine intervention.

30:35.576 --> 30:37.210
The invisible hand of the free market.

30:37.399 --> 30:39.716
- How much?
- 60 bucks.

30:39.885 --> 30:42.524
How much a beggar in Karachi
could get for a chunk of his liver.

30:43.971 --> 30:45.241
Your deal, Bob.

30:49.377 --> 30:51.402
It's been a long time?

30:51.969 --> 30:55.182
- Is it that obvious?
- No, no, it's just...

30:55.547 --> 30:58.121
We, we got all the time in the world.

30:58.846 --> 31:01.626
I want you...

31:02.677 --> 31:04.067
Right now.

31:15.330 --> 31:16.668
Oh my god!

31:20.692 --> 31:21.705
You okay?

31:23.785 --> 31:24.815
You okay?

31:27.614 --> 31:29.040
What happened, Mayko?

31:31.429 --> 31:32.892
What happened? What's the matter?

31:33.029 --> 31:34.625
I get... I, oh god!

31:35.294 --> 31:36.822
I get these shooting pains.

31:37.777 --> 31:40.415
- Below the knee.
- Okay, just come here.

31:43.139 --> 31:44.441
It's right...

31:46.194 --> 31:48.174
- It's right... Yeah.
- Right here?

31:52.018 --> 31:53.099
Right here?

31:54.236 --> 31:56.053
Look, I know I'm a head case.

31:56.133 --> 31:57.810
Just rub the thing, please.

31:58.157 --> 31:59.170
Okay.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.658
I'm sorry, I just...
This is fucking crazy.

32:10.391 --> 32:11.407
May...

32:12.214 --> 32:13.261
Mayko!

32:34.870 --> 32:37.255
Dios mio! Mira quien esta aqui.

32:41.434 --> 32:43.648
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

32:44.051 --> 32:45.098
You look good.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.655
- You too. How was your trip?
- It was good.

32:47.779 --> 32:49.564
Come, let's go in the conference room.

32:50.014 --> 32:53.034
They were right. I checked
the results myself. It's not bird flu.

32:53.244 --> 32:55.351
I know, but there's more to this.

32:55.431 --> 32:56.440
What?

32:58.248 --> 33:02.078
I really think, and I know you're gonna
think this sounds crazy.

33:03.495 --> 33:04.503
What, Joanna?

33:05.001 --> 33:06.957
I think there's some
kind of cover-up going on.

33:07.802 --> 33:08.963
Another conspiracy.

33:09.043 --> 33:11.425
- Don't patronize me, Carlos.
- Joanna...

33:12.859 --> 33:14.250
Sorry, am I interrupting?

33:14.438 --> 33:17.197
No. This is Joanna,
an old friend of mine.

33:18.513 --> 33:20.504
We were residents together at Duke.

33:21.327 --> 33:23.801
- David SandstrÃ¶m.
- Head Scientist at NorBAC.

33:23.900 --> 33:24.935
Pleasure.

33:25.557 --> 33:26.809
What brings you here?

33:27.517 --> 33:29.058
The birds in Washington.

33:29.138 --> 33:31.331
Joanna is the regional
caseworker for the CDC.

33:32.282 --> 33:33.786
I've only been on the job 6 months.

33:33.866 --> 33:36.418
I saw the story on the news.
No H5N1 though, right?

33:37.233 --> 33:40.099
But what's not on the news
is that there's also sick people.

33:40.463 --> 33:41.716
What kind of sick people?

33:42.070 --> 33:43.707
High fever. Spasticity.

33:43.796 --> 33:46.311
Convulsions.
Loss of sensation in the extremities.

33:46.678 --> 33:47.844
Sounds like meningitis.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.415
It's not. The official line
is the birds are not infecting humans.

33:51.556 --> 33:53.849
Once we determined it wasn't H5N1,

33:53.929 --> 33:56.043
Governor Gibson called
my superior in Washington.

33:56.133 --> 33:59.214
The next thing I know, my
investigation's been shut down.

33:59.294 --> 34:00.334
Why?

34:00.596 --> 34:01.659
Tourist season.

34:02.311 --> 34:04.512
Joanna is famous for
jumping to conclusions.

34:04.592 --> 34:06.052
Maybe 15 years ago.

34:06.132 --> 34:09.184
Don't worry about it.
He says the same thing about me.

34:10.525 --> 34:13.001
The birds and the people are still sick.

34:13.447 --> 34:15.507
If it's not avian flu, what is it?

34:15.705 --> 34:17.585
- Could it be environmental?
- Well, exactly!

34:17.724 --> 34:21.621
And that strand of my investigation
is being shut down by the EPA.

34:21.909 --> 34:23.949
First the CDC. Now the EPA.

34:24.030 --> 34:25.426
What do you think's going on?

34:25.505 --> 34:29.032
Whatever it is, it stinks.
I don't care if it costs my job.

34:29.158 --> 34:30.860
And I'm not being impetuous.

34:32.311 --> 34:33.797
Alright. What do you want from us?

34:33.962 --> 34:36.331
I'm a nobody at the CDC.
You guys have pull.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.724
I need your help.

34:41.071 --> 34:42.118
Okay.

34:48.304 --> 34:50.067
I'll find Bob, see what he's got.

34:50.147 --> 34:51.161
Great.

34:51.242 --> 34:52.568
- Coffee?
- Tea.

34:57.354 --> 35:00.314
You want me to weigh
in on your behalf at the CDC.

35:00.394 --> 35:01.698
You know anyone there?

35:03.620 --> 35:06.089
I know how to get Carl Riddlemeyer.
Cream and sugar?

35:06.258 --> 35:07.273
Sugar.

35:07.661 --> 35:09.245
The new science czar. Really?

35:09.484 --> 35:12.870
He's new to the job.
Doesn't know shit from shinola.

35:14.251 --> 35:17.023
He'll do anything
to avoid bad publicity.

35:17.103 --> 35:18.117
Right, Rachel?

35:19.572 --> 35:21.912
- Hi. I'm Rachel Woods.
- Joanna Sabean.

35:21.992 --> 35:26.054
Joanna is the one who sent us the birds.
Now the CDC is trying to shut her up.

35:26.933 --> 35:28.071
It's a weird time.

35:28.151 --> 35:31.524
Bush hates science. That doesn't agree
with what his neo-con cronies tell him.

35:32.372 --> 35:34.894
Well, that's a bit
of an oversimplification, but...

35:35.072 --> 35:36.944
He's taken an axe
to every research department

35:37.024 --> 35:38.583
that isn't dedicated to the Defense.

35:39.232 --> 35:42.431
All the good people are leaving.
The ones that stay are ass-kissers.

35:43.126 --> 35:44.946
I'll be sure and tell
my friends who stayed.

35:45.026 --> 35:46.992
You're not the type
that holds back, are you?

35:47.263 --> 35:48.616
What good does it get ya?

35:49.157 --> 35:50.172
Guys.

35:50.994 --> 35:52.313
Bob's ready for us.

35:53.294 --> 35:54.934
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

35:56.823 --> 35:57.888
Carlos.

36:00.137 --> 36:01.541
How well do you know her?

36:02.589 --> 36:04.723
No, don't even think about it.

36:04.973 --> 36:06.333
It was that obvious, eh?

36:06.413 --> 36:08.450
Like a dog chasing hot tires.

36:08.721 --> 36:12.610
Ah man. That is one exceptionally
beautiful public health official.

36:13.355 --> 36:14.797
- Yes, she's very pretty.
- No.

36:15.189 --> 36:16.663
Daffodils are pretty.

36:18.354 --> 36:20.502
She is something else entirely.

36:24.142 --> 36:27.527
We got a fractional chemical analysis
on this Double-Crested Cormorant.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.513
A wonderful, graceful bird by the way.

36:29.593 --> 36:31.941
It can dive and feed at
a 100 feet for 5 minutes.

36:32.028 --> 36:33.189
And this...

36:34.682 --> 36:35.815
a Hooded Merganser.

36:36.643 --> 36:38.802
The readings were extreme.

36:39.394 --> 36:41.863
- Methyl mercury.
- 'Scuse me.

36:42.776 --> 36:45.076
They've never seen
concentrations like this.

36:45.385 --> 36:46.586
They're off the dial.

36:48.505 --> 36:49.510
No, it's not.

36:50.009 --> 36:51.088
Oh, hi!

36:55.041 --> 36:57.449
Sorry, how'd you get past security?

36:57.529 --> 37:00.522
Israeli commando.
We can walk through walls.

37:01.334 --> 37:03.137
Look, I uh, I called.

37:03.217 --> 37:05.938
- I left a message, like, twice.
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

37:07.568 --> 37:09.863
I just... I kinda felt weird about

37:10.688 --> 37:12.611
- the whole thing.
- Okay. I know how you feel.

37:13.717 --> 37:14.998
And don't! Okay?

37:15.078 --> 37:16.833
- I, but Milo, I...
- Just...

37:17.671 --> 37:18.723
Look...

37:19.605 --> 37:20.673
You're amazing.

37:21.310 --> 37:24.125
And that's all I wanted to say. And...

37:25.824 --> 37:28.156
I don't know, you know, and...

37:28.236 --> 37:29.969
- Oh god.
- Oh, there's security.

37:30.077 --> 37:32.347
I could take him out
but I'm just gonna go.

37:32.427 --> 37:34.492
- And I'll... Just call me, okay?
- Okay.

37:34.572 --> 37:36.043
Yeah? See ya.

38:06.635 --> 38:07.762
So that's it?

38:08.523 --> 38:10.733
If Katarina Zvorkovec
was the last link, that's it.

38:11.099 --> 38:13.043
She was his mistress
for a little over a year.

38:13.657 --> 38:16.284
- What kind of transplant did he get?
- Small bowel transplant.

38:18.071 --> 38:19.085
So that's it.

38:20.557 --> 38:22.986
Good work busting
Mr. Transplant, by the way.

38:23.713 --> 38:25.954
To tell you the truth,
I rather enjoyed myself.

38:26.267 --> 38:28.320
You're turning into
a regular rat terrier, Wes.

38:28.803 --> 38:30.545
I'll take that as a compliment.

38:30.651 --> 38:32.241
Step up from a rat.

38:32.691 --> 38:34.061
Speaking of which...

38:34.653 --> 38:37.369
Alright. That went extremely well.

38:38.790 --> 38:40.380
Image is everything.

38:42.060 --> 38:45.186
Well, I like the image I can get with
an electron microscope, so I'll shut up.

38:45.266 --> 38:49.150
As long as I'm here, what's this about
corruption in the EPA and the CDC?

38:49.323 --> 38:51.881
- You talked to Rachel?
- And I made a couple of calls.

38:52.343 --> 38:53.640
I don't see the problem.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.749
You don't see doors slamming
on a junior person

38:55.829 --> 38:57.598
seems have a pretty good case a problem?

38:57.730 --> 39:01.590
My understanding is that the CDC said
that there was no Avian Flu outbreak.

39:01.717 --> 39:03.776
- Did your lab not confirm that?
- Yes but...

39:03.856 --> 39:05.608
Did NorBAC not agree with this finding?

39:05.688 --> 39:08.787
We found massive levels of
mercury contamination in those birds.

39:09.001 --> 39:11.415
- EPA was slow off the mark, granted.
- Granted?!

39:11.495 --> 39:13.041
That's nice and goddamn convenient.

39:13.970 --> 39:16.467
Let's keep it nice and calm.
That's the way I like to work.

39:16.547 --> 39:20.305
We've got birds and possibly people
loaded with lethal levels of mercury.

39:20.385 --> 39:22.227
We've got to find out
where it's coming from.

39:22.359 --> 39:24.789
No one is questioning
the need for an investigation.

39:24.944 --> 39:27.050
Indeed, Governor Gibson
is a good friend of mine.

39:27.828 --> 39:29.829
He assures me that
things will be handled locally.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.575
You know what? I think your pal
the Governor doesn't want anybody

39:32.655 --> 39:35.259
fucking with his tourist season.
We're going out there tonight.

39:35.342 --> 39:37.697
Why don't we
strategize on this together?

39:38.009 --> 39:40.223
Good idea. I'll call you when I'm there.

39:54.497 --> 39:56.184
Can't believe you're
not even listening.

39:56.264 --> 39:58.732
- Why should I listen to this?
- Because I know him <i>and</i> you.

39:58.819 --> 40:00.946
No, correction!
You knew me 12 years ago!

40:01.474 --> 40:04.398
I don't think it's appropriate
in a professional setting to be having

40:04.478 --> 40:08.098
- a relationship with someone.
- Fuck, that's bogus latino machismo.

40:08.979 --> 40:10.016
Look...

40:10.165 --> 40:13.675
- Sometimes David uses women.
- And sometimes I can use men. So?

40:16.539 --> 40:19.599
- You and your secrets.
- My personal life is my personal life.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.564
What are you so afraid of?

40:24.408 --> 40:25.480
Double-double.

40:27.047 --> 40:28.119
Carlos.

40:31.882 --> 40:32.971
Everything alright?

40:36.232 --> 40:39.528
Just to clear the air,
Joanna and I were married for 3 years.

40:40.963 --> 40:42.986
How could I not know this about you?

40:43.418 --> 40:44.926
He has a very big closet.

40:45.071 --> 40:48.017
- She's the one who kicked me out of it.
- The marriage and the closet.

40:50.449 --> 40:52.610
Well, bravo to you.

40:53.399 --> 40:54.505
Thank you.

40:56.252 --> 40:57.255
Details?

40:57.652 --> 40:58.949
I think you know enough.

41:00.651 --> 41:01.664
Man of mystery.

41:04.939 --> 41:06.907
He thinks that you
and I have a lot in common.

41:06.987 --> 41:08.038
Really?

41:23.513 --> 41:26.885
Timothy Bosch.
Executive Assistant to the Governor.

41:27.016 --> 41:28.469
How old are you, Tim?

41:29.264 --> 41:31.598
- 29.
- Wow. You're moving fast.

41:32.439 --> 41:35.154
My father and Governor Gibson
went to law school together.

41:36.189 --> 41:38.978
Nothing like a little nepotism
to jump-start the all career, eh?

41:39.400 --> 41:41.648
A lot of people are cynical
about government.

41:41.804 --> 41:43.982
Not me. I want to make a difference.

41:44.745 --> 41:46.786
You're gonna do that by babysitting us?

41:48.107 --> 41:50.433
I just think, you'll find
that doors open a lot easier

41:50.513 --> 41:52.415
when you bring
along the guy with all the keys.

41:53.435 --> 41:54.577
What do you think?

41:55.884 --> 41:59.619
Timothy wouldn't take my calls this time
last week, so what's not to like?

42:00.627 --> 42:01.629
Alright.

42:01.709 --> 42:04.644
Well, don't worry about it. We'll lose
him the moment his back is turned.

42:04.740 --> 42:07.485
- Where are we headed?
- Mountain View Hospital.

42:13.695 --> 42:16.650
We want to look at those patients
that aren't part of a massive cover-up.

42:22.851 --> 42:24.632
Classic Minimata presentation.

42:27.364 --> 42:29.252
- I'll just wait outside.
- Actually Tim,

42:29.332 --> 42:32.430
I think it would be good
if you stayed right here.

42:33.812 --> 42:36.164
Get a first-hand
account for the Governor.

42:39.226 --> 42:41.104
20 parts per million.

42:41.457 --> 42:43.466
We could use this kid's
blood in a thermometer.

42:44.060 --> 42:46.635
I'm going to need to see
all the results from neurology.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.097
David, I think it's better
if I stay and...

42:50.231 --> 42:52.939
- try to set up some kind of treatment.
- Chelation therapy?

42:53.613 --> 42:55.113
I don't see an option.

42:55.256 --> 42:57.607
- Sorry, Chelation therapy?
- Oh, they...

42:57.815 --> 43:00.426
put a chemical in his blood
to sop up the mercury.

43:00.906 --> 43:02.169
So you can do something?

43:02.957 --> 43:03.977
Well...

43:04.375 --> 43:06.311
to a certain extent. But...

43:07.497 --> 43:10.414
young Kyle here can look
forward to many years of suffering

43:10.494 --> 43:14.033
before he finally gets cured.
We gotta figure this out fast.

43:14.130 --> 43:15.548
We can see the others.

43:16.499 --> 43:18.910
Dwight and Gavin Leopold
came in the other day.

43:18.990 --> 43:21.795
Neither one of them have been
sick a day in their lives, so they say.

43:21.875 --> 43:23.668
- First time's a bitch.
- Yes.

43:23.772 --> 43:25.311
- Dwight?
- Yes.

43:25.459 --> 43:28.570
I've brought in some specialists that
wanna find out what happened to you.

43:28.650 --> 43:31.742
So they have to ask you a few questions.
Alright with that?

43:31.919 --> 43:33.393
- Kyle's your grandson?
- Yes.

43:33.473 --> 43:35.820
- He go duck hunting with you?
- No, he's too young.

43:36.667 --> 43:38.226
He stayed at home with his momma.

43:38.332 --> 43:41.162
- But he ate the duck?
- Yeah. He loves it.

43:41.242 --> 43:43.180
The duck was contaminated with mercury.

43:43.260 --> 43:45.953
You've been poisoned, so we need
to know where the ducks came from.

43:47.598 --> 43:49.953
I'm not a cop, Dwight.
Where'd you shoot the ducks?

43:50.033 --> 43:51.160
Krauts.

43:51.281 --> 43:53.771
They fence off land
I've hunted my whole life.

43:54.290 --> 43:56.400
Bastards can't keep us out.

43:56.728 --> 43:57.800
Elgin.

44:00.049 --> 44:03.263
The Elgin Wilderness was one of
the last great tracts in the Cascades.

44:03.381 --> 44:07.197
Couple of years ago, a local consortium
sold it to German casino operators.

44:07.467 --> 44:09.231
Pissed a lot of people off.

44:09.853 --> 44:12.629
Locals used to go hunting and
fishing here. Now there's a big fence.

44:12.709 --> 44:16.168
Around 90 square miles of the
most beautiful country in the state.

44:48.912 --> 44:52.906
- They only got 150 million for this?
- Plus a share of the revenues.

44:53.107 --> 44:55.202
So Dwight and his buddies
came hunting up here.

44:55.282 --> 44:57.974
Okay, the ducks are what?
They, they summer here?

44:58.054 --> 45:00.622
And then what?
They come to the lake to feed?

45:00.725 --> 45:04.742
- Weeds and fish could be laced with it.
- The lake's the source of the mercury?

45:04.880 --> 45:06.614
I'm say it's a pretty good candidate.

45:06.718 --> 45:08.116
But there's no way.

45:08.196 --> 45:11.085
EPA would have had to have tested
the water as part of the land sale.

45:11.165 --> 45:13.361
Surely, they would have found it.

45:18.062 --> 45:19.627
Maybe they missed something.

45:23.042 --> 45:25.503
Got any more doors
you wanna open for us, Tim?

45:32.451 --> 45:33.800
I gotta get that!

45:34.993 --> 45:36.140
- What?!
<i>- Oh David,</i>

45:36.220 --> 45:37.634
I need to speak to Joanna.

45:37.714 --> 45:39.206
<i>Basically to tell her</i>

45:39.286 --> 45:40.898
she was right about the EPA cover-up.

45:40.978 --> 45:42.934
That's some sort
of airborne contamination.

45:43.014 --> 45:44.871
I want you to get
samples from each sites.

45:44.951 --> 45:46.636
Compare that to the mercury in water.

45:46.716 --> 45:49.164
We find a match, we'll find out
who's milfing Mother Nature.

45:49.244 --> 45:51.983
Governor Gibson is part of
an investment group that sold

45:52.063 --> 45:55.515
<i>that tract of land to a casino
and resort developer over 3 years ago.</i>

45:55.595 --> 45:58.311
You feel like coming up to Toronto
for a visit anytime soon?

45:58.393 --> 46:00.870
- Not really.
- We may never see each other again.

46:01.285 --> 46:02.926
That's what makes it so hot.

46:03.006 --> 46:05.801
You're experiencing a phenomenon
known as phantom limb pain.

46:05.881 --> 46:09.452
This is not a phenomenon Gordon.
I told you the pain is real.

46:09.565 --> 46:12.243
Conventional medicine isn't
gonna solve what's going on up here.

46:12.377 --> 46:15.972
I got the head office call.
They're taking me off the Mercury case.

46:16.623 --> 46:18.804
- When did this happen?
- They need help with a...

46:18.884 --> 46:22.304
C. difficile outbreak
in a hospital in Racine, Wisconsin.

46:22.482 --> 46:23.935
That was the hospital in Racine.

46:24.079 --> 46:27.057
Joanna's in quarantine there.
She's infected with CDAD.
