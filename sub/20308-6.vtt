WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:04.504
(people chattering)

00:04.587 --> 00:08.591
Operations and assignments
at The Painted Lady Saloon.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.177
We have detectives LaRue and Washington,

00:11.261 --> 00:15.098
initiate a new investigation
in their ongoing arson operation.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.642
That address is 112 Rome Avenue.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.644
I lost that Chinese chick's phone number.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.355
That is the correct address,
isn't it, Detective LaRue?

00:23.023 --> 00:25.692
(stuttering)
Oh, yeah, I... I was just telling Neal

00:25.775 --> 00:27.652
how much I'm looking forward

00:27.736 --> 00:31.197
to initiating the arson
investigation, Sarge.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.991
Yeah, tonight in a Chinese laundry.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.993
-(laughs)
-That's a section two alert, people.

00:35.076 --> 00:38.413
All right, pairings,
Engle, you're with Altman.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.415
Dailey, you're with Silvegi here.

00:40.498 --> 00:43.168
Court testimony Detective Belker.

00:43.251 --> 00:46.921
Also, Officer Russo
and Lieutenant Goldblume

00:47.005 --> 00:50.842
continue undercover in Division's
liquor racketeering investigation.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.010
Item eight...

00:52.093 --> 00:53.303
(chuckles)

00:54.429 --> 00:57.057
Today at 1500 hours

00:57.140 --> 01:00.310
Uncle John Petruzzi goes to jail.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.395
(cheering)

01:02.479 --> 01:04.105
Uncle John's last day of freedom.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.982
You know, I think
it's a shameful thing, Sarge,

01:06.066 --> 01:07.984
the papers treating
that man like a celebrity.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.111
The sentiment's shared
at the podium, Andrew.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.906
-RENKO: Yes, sir.
-But his neighbors are turning out

01:12.989 --> 01:15.075
to send the great man off.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.619
Sergeant Bates and Officer Flaherty,

01:17.702 --> 01:20.413
you are assigned
to crowd and traffic control.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.165
Also, you will check

01:22.248 --> 01:24.459
with Captain Furillo
for further instructions.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.794
Item nine...

01:28.421 --> 01:31.925
with reference to yesterday's shooting
death of officer James Sanders.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.720
While the fatuous press
lionizes the misguided vigilante

01:35.804 --> 01:38.014
who took Officer Sanders' life,

01:38.098 --> 01:39.599
I convey the...

01:40.683 --> 01:45.522
more pedestrian information
that he is survived by his wife and child.

01:46.397 --> 01:49.776
There is a contribution jar on my desk.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.321
Have a safe tour, all of you.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.490
Dismissed.

01:55.573 --> 01:59.035
(clamoring)

01:59.119 --> 02:00.662
Traffic control.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.039
Should've wore my dayglo gloves.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.209
Maybe the captain wants to coach us
on arm signals, huh?

02:06.918 --> 02:08.044
Message, Lieutenant.

02:09.504 --> 02:10.964
I don't know any Dottie Walker.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.717
Well she says she's the talent coordinator
for <i>The Don Chesler Show,</i> Lieutenant.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.261
They want to know
if you're available tonight

02:16.344 --> 02:18.054
to talk about your friend who got killed.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.097
No.

02:21.432 --> 02:22.642
That's for a cop's family.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.521
I don't know,
maybe her number's in my other shirt.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.565
This is fair warning, mister,

02:28.648 --> 02:30.525
by arresting me
you're going to be buying yourself

02:30.608 --> 02:32.235
into more trouble
than you've ever known before,

02:32.318 --> 02:34.028
because I am Bilbao,

02:34.362 --> 02:38.575
and I have the capacity to gypsy curse you
beyond your wildest imagination.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.701
If your name's Bilbao,

02:39.784 --> 02:42.620
how come your driver's license
is Nathan Goldfarb?

02:42.704 --> 02:46.416
He is Nathan Goldfarb.
Don't listen to him what he says.

02:47.083 --> 02:50.753
I tell myself it's a midlife crisis,
I should stand by him.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.255
Who is this woman?

02:52.338 --> 02:55.717
Saved $35,000
from selling a taxi medallion.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.386
All of a sudden he's a storefront gypsy.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.597
The landlord made a complaint, ma'am.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.349
Residing in a commercial space,
cooking animals.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.144
We like at 147th Street and Dekker.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.479
We have an apartment, it's very nice.

03:08.563 --> 03:12.358
And he sits like a meshugana,
on the floor, in a store front,

03:12.442 --> 03:14.694
cooking terrible foods without vents.

03:14.777 --> 03:18.740
Thank God, madam, I am not your husband,
or I'd strangle you with my bare hands.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.367
He puts up a sign, "tarot readings."

03:21.451 --> 03:24.120
God forbid someone
should ask him to read one.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.038
Book him!

03:25.121 --> 03:27.498
Maybe he'll forget about this nonsense.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.666
If you book me, mister...

03:28.750 --> 03:32.170
-Now, don't make me add resisting, sir--
-All right, you leave me no other choice.

03:32.253 --> 03:36.299
Dark eye of Satan, Lord of Romani.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.343
When the blood has been betrayed...

03:38.760 --> 03:40.637
let 100 demons reign.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.305
What did you just do to me?

03:42.388 --> 03:44.140
The curse of 100 demons.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.892
If there is a worse curse

03:45.975 --> 03:47.894
-I don't want to know from it.
-Come on!

03:47.977 --> 03:49.896
-Domestic call, Renko.
-JOE: He put a curse on me.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.106
-Renko.
-I can't work with no curse.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.067
What makes you so special?

03:55.318 --> 03:58.112
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:58.738 --> 03:59.989
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:00.073 --> 04:03.910
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:03.993 --> 04:05.495
(sirens wailing)

04:11.251 --> 04:14.254
(theme music playing)

06:09.285 --> 06:12.080
Office Russo and Lieutenant Goldblume
have been on loan

06:12.163 --> 06:14.957
to division's liquor
racketeering operation.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.417
Officer Russo is undercover.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.961
-(coughs)
-In the course of her undercover work,

06:19.045 --> 06:21.214
she's developed information
that there may be an attempt

06:21.297 --> 06:23.841
on John Petruzzi's life
before he goes to jail.

06:23.925 --> 06:24.884
What kind of information?

06:24.967 --> 06:27.053
Tina's been working
with Dominic Donatelli,

06:27.136 --> 06:28.221
Petruzzi's right hand man.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.807
(coughing)

06:30.890 --> 06:33.226
I'm sorry, I... I got a frog here.

06:33.976 --> 06:38.106
So Officer Russo has been working
under Dominic Donatelli.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.192
-Be nice to know a time and place.
-I'm trying to find out.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.820
We've passed the information
to the Marshall's office.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.696
Lieutenant Buntz, you'll coordinate

06:45.780 --> 06:47.949
by following Petruzzi
with the man assigned

06:48.032 --> 06:48.950
by the federal marshal.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.285
-Who is?
-They haven't told us yet.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.703
Par for the course.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.247
Lucy, you two will be on crowd control.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.998
I want you to keep
your distance from Petruzzi.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.084
I don't want you caught
in a possible crossfire.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.043
Twist our arms.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.879
Uh, Lieutenant Goldblume's
preparing warrants

07:01.963 --> 07:04.757
here at the precinct
for the racketeering arrests.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.718
He'll relay to the site
in case Tina develops

07:07.802 --> 07:08.845
more specific information.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.388
Are you all right, Norm?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.057
(clears throat) Okay, Captain, thanks.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.022
Tina...

07:21.774 --> 07:25.278
I know it's a rough assignment
with, uh, Donatelli.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.530
If I can get time and place,
Captain, I will.

07:27.613 --> 07:31.367
I think the captain means
he knows you're walking on eggshells.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.411
It's okay.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.293
The building we're talking about
is on Jerome Avenue, right?

07:40.376 --> 07:41.210
What building?

07:41.586 --> 07:44.088
Hey, I thought you said this guy
wanted something burned.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.091
We're talking hypothetical,
a hypothetical building.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.801
Hypothetically, it's on Jerome.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.513
Hypothetically, the freaking bills
on this place are putting me under.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.558
There ain't a dollar in it for me,
unless it's burned.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.103
You the guys for the job...
Hypothetically?

07:59.187 --> 08:01.647
A match has been known
to drop from our hand.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.774
-It's happened.
-How much?

08:03.858 --> 08:05.067
Hypothetically?

08:05.151 --> 08:08.779
-I need a phone, 911, I need the police!
-Beat it!

08:08.863 --> 08:11.032
There's a crazy guy out there,
hurt this old lady.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.450
It's a tough city.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.534
Hey, where you going?

08:14.994 --> 08:17.205
Come on, it's an old lady after all.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.834
Uh, real public-minded, your friend.
A regular boy scout.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.003
You asked the question,
how much for a fire?

08:24.086 --> 08:25.880
Saw him knock an old lady
down and take her purse.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.173
Me and my buddy chased him here.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.966
Go away, I don't want
your blood on my hand.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.176
My quarrel is not with you!

08:30.259 --> 08:33.054
Yeah, hit me, you little creep.
I'm no old lady, I'll crush your head.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.389
Hold it! Hold it, police, all right!

08:35.473 --> 08:37.391
-Hey, you're busted.
-I'm busted?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.602
All right,
where's the old lady he roughed up?

08:39.685 --> 08:41.521
Gone. I think her daughter was with her,
they got on the bus.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.856
-Hey, I make the deals.
-Hey, you guys are cops, huh?

08:43.940 --> 08:45.858
-You think I didn't know?
-Oh, we had you, sucker.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.444
Had who?
Our talks were purely hypothetical.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.781
All right, come on, dwarf, I hope at least
there's money in the purse.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.032
Good thing you came.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.992
Oh, I'm thrilled, come on, fellas.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.119
I got to go to work, here,
I wrote our names.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.121
This is just swell, Neal.

08:59.413 --> 09:01.749
Uh, next time I need
a building torched by cops,

09:01.832 --> 09:03.417
I'll call you two guys.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.546
What kind of landlord, tenant dispute?

09:06.629 --> 09:09.173
I feel weird, you know, lightheaded.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.677
Where are you going with this, Renko?
You going for a personal day?

09:12.760 --> 09:14.971
I'm not going for a personal day,
Mr. Wisenheimer.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.347
I'm just telling you
that I don't feel good.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.224
Cowboy, you're talking yourself
into something

09:18.307 --> 09:20.268
behind that screwball gypsy's curse.

09:20.351 --> 09:23.980
Until a hundred thousand demons
reign right into my face.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.190
-The cops.
-You're a jerk, you know that?

09:26.274 --> 09:29.235
Says very clearly, no pets.
Here, read the lease.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.320
I don't have to read this lease.
I don't have to read nothing.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.448
Sir, there's a complaint procedure
if your tenant has a pet violation.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.493
-Not just one pet.
-Wait, what, two pets, three?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.495
-Thousands.
-(buzzing)

09:40.329 --> 09:41.831
-Bees.
-Oh, my Lord.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.625
-The book says they're harmless.
-What booklet?

09:44.709 --> 09:47.503
I am going into business.
I'm going to sell the honey.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.172
Well, they're-they're not the kinda
bees that bite, are they?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.843
They can.
I mean, they still got their sting.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.304
-But the book says they don't.
-(buzzing intensifies)

09:57.597 --> 09:59.473
(screams)

09:59.557 --> 10:02.143
-(grunts)
-Where are you going?

10:02.226 --> 10:05.271
Uh, sir, this is a problem
for your animal control, sir,

10:05.354 --> 10:08.149
or your landlord-tenant
reconciliation panel.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.318
You guys just work it out
yourselves, all right?

10:10.860 --> 10:13.321
-And you, you say the bees don't bite!
-That's what it said.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.115
-That's what your book says?!
-It wasn't supposed to happen, all right?!

10:16.198 --> 10:17.658
It's too bad I don't have
a curse on me, Robert.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.869
Too bad I don't feel like
my nose is going to explode!

10:19.952 --> 10:21.495
(groans)

10:22.288 --> 10:23.789
(people chattering)

10:25.374 --> 10:29.420
WOMAN 1: Look at him, a don,
but he always has time for everyone.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.505
WOMAN 2: He's still a handsome man.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.258
I remember when he came
to Angie's confirmation.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.970
Right, he's a great American, ladies.
Let's just clear the sidewalk, okay?

10:38.054 --> 10:41.766
-Listen, I knew him 21 years ago.
-Oh, I bet you did.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.435
(car horns)

10:45.728 --> 10:48.856
Look at this guy, he's going to jail
and it looks like he's on a picnic.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.274
What do you think jail's
going to be for him?

10:50.358 --> 10:52.193
These mob guys got it waxed.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.736
-Hill Street cops?
-Yeah.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.987
Detective Buntz.

10:55.404 --> 10:56.989
-Right there.
-Thank you.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.992
You think that guy
walks like a federal marshal?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.952
PATRICK:
That's why they called those flatfoots.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.041
-Federal marshal.
-Anybody shot yet?

11:07.124 --> 11:08.668
You'd have been a big help if they were.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.587
-Hudson.
-Buntz.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.922
Real impressed at the federal building

11:13.005 --> 11:15.424
with the quality information
you people passed along.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.094
Your informant come up
with anything a little more specific?

11:18.552 --> 11:20.554
She's on her back right now working on it.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.392
-Canker sore.
-Mercy.

11:25.893 --> 11:29.021
-Look, it's Moses.
-That's not the way it's done.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.899
Cross at the corner just like real people.

11:31.982 --> 11:32.942
She's right, Jimmy.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.196
-What's the matter with you, huh?
-Nothin'.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.447
I'm sorry, Officer.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.825
You left your coat at
the bakery, Mr. Petruzzi.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.535
Oh, thank you.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.329
-Give him 20 bucks.
-Ah, I couldn't accept that.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.541
-A pleasure to serve.
-Thank you.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.961
Now he's going to ask me
if I'm in The Knights of Columbus.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.463
-What the?
-What's the matter?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.506
What's that, sir?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.467
A bullseye?

11:59.760 --> 12:01.929
Uh, someone's a comedian, huh?

12:02.012 --> 12:05.349
-Smart guy, huh?
-What's up, Sal, what's on your mind?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.351
Yeah, go on, swing on him,
that'd be a good idea.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.186
That's all right, it's all right, Jimmy.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.356
The officer can chuckle
about his joke on Uncle John

12:12.440 --> 12:15.651
while he tries to make
his mortgage payments.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.823
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing. I think I'm okay.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.451
You people got something against
having a quiet day?

12:32.042 --> 12:34.587
-Hey, Mick.
-Hey, Stan.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.130
-How you doin'?
-Good.

12:36.630 --> 12:37.882
What are you doing here?

12:38.674 --> 12:41.427
What, I louse up the date?
Weren't we going to get together?

12:41.719 --> 12:42.678
Right.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.431
Lunch.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.350
I still got to go in and testify.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.393
What's the case?

12:49.477 --> 12:51.771
Hm, drug buy, Whitmore Bridge area.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.147
Ah, that stuff's going
through that neighborhood

12:53.230 --> 12:54.565
like Sherman to the sea.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.067
-It's coming down my way, too.
-I'm ready for you, Detective.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.236
Oh, thank you. You don't mind waiting?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.529
No, no, go ahead.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.241
-You want to watch?
-Yeah, maybe I'll watch for a while.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.619
Check out your courtroom demeanor, huh?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.043
-You're back.
-Hi, Dom.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.422
-So how's your mom?
-I think she knows.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.759
-What do you mean?
-I think she knows about us, Dom.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.553
-Knows what about us, honey?
-We haven't done anything yet.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.223
Ever since I was a little girl,
she knows what I'm thinking.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.517
She knows exactly what's on my mind.

13:29.600 --> 13:34.104
Oh, Dom, Dom,
you know that drives me crazy.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.148
You know that one thing
leads to another and--

13:36.232 --> 13:39.819
-That's right.
-Dom, Dom, no.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.154
Besides...

13:44.031 --> 13:46.116
I think you've got your mind
on something else.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.203
-Tin...
-Come on, tell me.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.705
-(sighs)
-Uncle John, what?

13:51.789 --> 13:53.207
Will you forget about it?

13:53.290 --> 13:55.459
Oh, so now you're the tease, you are.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.752
(laughs)

13:57.336 --> 13:58.796
Okay, okay.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.506
He gets it today.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.468
-Uncle John never sees no jail.
-I thought so.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.555
I thought I heard you
and that Larry guy talking about it.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.724
Well, ain't this a red letter day
for me, huh?

14:10.808 --> 14:14.311
(chuckles) Uncle John
finally off my back for the first time.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.729
So when's it going to happen?

14:16.272 --> 14:18.065
It's so creepy talking about it.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.818
We got time...

14:21.944 --> 14:23.153
if you wanted to use it.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.490
Stop.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.158
(soft chuckles)

14:30.077 --> 14:31.954
All right, close your eyes.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.497
Close them.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.510
Come out, come out wherever you are.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.600
I'm out four or five Gs,

14:52.683 --> 14:54.393
but don't bother to open it
or anything like that.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.145
(both chuckling)

14:59.398 --> 15:01.275
A, I love you,

15:02.234 --> 15:05.362
which is the only time I've ever said that
when I wasn't full of it.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.532
And B, you've been right.

15:09.116 --> 15:12.328
Shacking up is for when you
don't respect somebody.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.457
So we get engaged, and we do it right.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.841
-All this money.
-It won't break me.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.305
Engaged isn't married.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.935
(Dom exhales)

15:36.018 --> 15:40.189
Dom, I'm sorry.
It's just, it's the way I was raised.

15:40.272 --> 15:44.360
I mean, I can feel my mother
looking at us right now.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.778
Okay.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.030
You're right.

15:48.906 --> 15:49.740
You're so good.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.618
(chuckles)

15:52.701 --> 15:55.746
-Just put the ring on.
-Engaged isn't married, Dom.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.998
You didn't drive down, either, huh?

15:58.082 --> 16:00.751
-Arm and a leg to park down here.
-That's crazy.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.795
You know, the stones on that kid.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.964
Dead to rights,
and he sits there lying through his teeth.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.590
They're all made out of ice today, Stan.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.176
I try not to buy that, you know,
that today's perp is--

16:09.259 --> 16:11.387
-Come on, get off!
-10-11, Mick. You see it?

16:11.470 --> 16:12.680
-Get off before you're going to get hurt!
-BELKER: I see it.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.390
I'll take him when he comes off the frame.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.101
(screaming and hollering)

16:17.184 --> 16:18.435
MAN: Give me that money!

16:18.519 --> 16:19.770
-Get me that coat!
-WOMAN: Leave me alone.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.147
Yeah, be quiet! Shut up!

16:23.774 --> 16:24.692
Police officer!

16:24.775 --> 16:29.196
(screaming)

16:29.279 --> 16:31.949
Get out! Get out. Back up!

16:32.032 --> 16:33.283
Back up or I'll kill her!

16:33.367 --> 16:36.328
-Back up, man, I'll kill her!
-Drop the knife. Drop it!

16:38.372 --> 16:41.125
On the ground, toe jam! Do it!

16:41.208 --> 16:43.627
-You got him, Mick?
-I got him.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.381
-Way to go, Stan.
-(laughs)

16:47.464 --> 16:49.091
We're a month setting up an arson number.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.094
This jamoke blows it
for an $8 purse snatch.

16:52.177 --> 16:55.055
First name Max, last name Emili.
Give him robbery and assault.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.266
The rest will be between me and God.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.185
What rest? Did you jaywalk
on your way into the alley?

17:04.857 --> 17:05.899
Lieutenant Goldblume.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.988
What-what language works with you people?

17:12.698 --> 17:15.075
Well, I'm sure Don
would take a sympathetic approach,

17:15.159 --> 17:16.326
but I'm not interested.

17:19.121 --> 17:22.708
Miss, I got to run up 48 arrest warrants
on illegal liquor traffic today.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.753
When I'm through tonight,
all I'm gonna want to do is go to bed.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.464
Talk shows want to hear about
your friend, Henry?

17:28.547 --> 17:29.840
They won't let up.

17:29.923 --> 17:34.219
Hm. I must say that I find
the public's hero worshipping fascination

17:34.303 --> 17:35.929
with Steve Merkur offensive.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.016
One of the people
he killed was a police officer.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.811
Steven didn't set out to kill a cop.
He didn't intend that.

17:42.895 --> 17:47.483
Oh, I'm sure that that's a consolation
to Sanders' widow.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.403
I've been patient as long as I can, Frank.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.364
The man has provoked me beyond toleration.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.492
He's the next thing
to openly insubordinate.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.744
-Just doesn't sound like Ray.
-What are you saying, Frank,

17:58.827 --> 17:59.995
that I'm making it up?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.289
Yesterday, he refused
to answer his intercom.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.917
Said if I wanted to see him,
I knew where his office was.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.127
And like an idiot, I go there.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.505
And as I'm leaving, I see in reflection,

18:09.588 --> 18:12.216
he's making faces at me, obscene gestures.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.842
It's ludicrous.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.386
Chief, he's been under a lot of stress.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.763
Losing his command,

18:17.846 --> 18:20.432
getting an assignment a lot
of people perceive as tokenism.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.851
Oh, when do we get to the part
where I give a damn?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.144
Well, I'm just wondering

18:24.228 --> 18:26.396
if he's not having
some sort of emotional problem.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.982
You want to know
Ray Calletano's problem, Frank?

18:29.066 --> 18:31.318
He wants equal opportunity,
till the heat's turned on,

18:31.401 --> 18:32.903
then he wants special consideration.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.155
Well, I'm through letting him
have it both ways.

18:35.239 --> 18:38.242
They can call me anti-Latino
or any other damn thing.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.619
He's going to act like a cop
or he's finished!

18:41.328 --> 18:42.454
Let me talk to him.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.959
Pronto, yeah, Frank? Our friend's
just about played out his string.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.086
(door closes)

18:51.213 --> 18:54.633
Howard, cancel my twelve o'clock
and get me Ray Calletano, would you?

18:54.716 --> 18:57.427
One two, one two. One two, one two.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.681
Are you sure, the little red light go on?

19:00.764 --> 19:02.933
-It's working, J.D.
-May I confess?

19:03.016 --> 19:05.227
You can confess in a minute, Mr. Emili.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.230
First, I want it on the record
that you declined--

19:08.313 --> 19:10.065
-I declined an attorney.
-Wait a minute.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.359
We've informed you
of your fifth amendment right

19:12.442 --> 19:14.111
and your right to have a lawyer.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.864
-Okay, now.
-I decline--

19:16.947 --> 19:18.824
See, because if you're thinking
down the road about

19:18.907 --> 19:21.285
pulling some number with this,
getting yourself off--

19:21.368 --> 19:22.327
I have taken lives.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.955
I would have taken the life
of that woman this morning.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.582
Sometime it has to stop.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.584
What lives have you taken, Mr. Emili?

19:30.210 --> 19:33.088
Appleman, Carter.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.509
(sighs)
It's time for all the names to come out.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.469
Like...

19:40.596 --> 19:42.431
cool falling rain.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.476
Weren't you the guy
got World War I started, huh?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.687
Whacked out that archduke
over there in Europe?

19:50.397 --> 19:54.526
I first took life eight years ago
and then not again for four years.

19:54.610 --> 19:59.740
I tried to hope it was a dream
that would never come again.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.701
But it did come again.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.455
-Sonya Appleman--
-That's someone you killed?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.457
Ernestine Carter.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.001
And suddenly...

20:15.380 --> 20:17.549
Tommy Schneider and...

20:20.385 --> 20:21.678
Louis Whitlock.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.264
Tommy Schneider's that 12-year-old.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.682
You killed him, Max?

20:26.558 --> 20:27.768
My hands...

20:29.686 --> 20:33.148
-strangled them.
-Yeah, that's what the paper said.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.652
(sighs)

20:37.903 --> 20:42.366
I took an ear from-- a piece of an ear,
from the Schneider boy.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.368
That wasn't in the papers.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.454
Ah, at last it's coming to an end.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.791
The circle...

20:52.668 --> 20:54.127
is being broken.

20:59.716 --> 21:00.717
J.D., Neal.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.052
We want to do this
by the numbers, Captain.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.137
;But Neal and me wanted to let you know
we think we might have

21:04.221 --> 21:05.138
-hooked a pretty big fish.
-Oh?

21:05.222 --> 21:07.516
Yeah, the guy's copping
to multiple homicides.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.893
-Credibility?
-Some pretty funky details.

21:09.977 --> 21:13.021
He knew about the Schneider kid's ear.
That wasn't in any of the papers.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.106
Was he Mirandized?

21:14.982 --> 21:17.276
-He have representation?
-Declines.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.778
Says it's on his conscience,
he wants to come clean.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.571
Our offer of representation is on record?

21:21.655 --> 21:24.032
-Every 20 seconds, Captain.
-J.D.: I'm telling you, Captain,

21:24.116 --> 21:26.118
I was a tough sell
on this creep at the start,

21:26.201 --> 21:27.703
but he's making me a believer.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.830
We have a warrant on his residence?

21:29.913 --> 21:30.831
Just came through.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.709
J.D. had it right,
take this by the numbers.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.751
You got it, Captain.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.258
I just want to tell you, Captain,

21:41.675 --> 21:43.135
if this thing breaks
the way I think it might,

21:43.218 --> 21:45.345
there's going to be recognition
for a lot of people.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.805
Let's not count our chickens.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.891
I'm just saying, if I get some ink,
I'm not gonna forget

21:49.975 --> 21:52.311
the people that stood by me
when it was tough sledding.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.271
And you're on that short list.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.024
Okay. Thank you.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.444
(door closes)

22:00.527 --> 22:03.905
-Dommy, when?
-Yeah?

22:05.032 --> 22:05.991
When what?

22:06.783 --> 22:08.035
When Uncle John?

22:08.910 --> 22:10.537
(chuckles)

22:10.620 --> 22:12.205
You're real cold, you know that?

22:13.248 --> 22:14.875
My little girl, my little church girl

22:14.958 --> 22:16.793
wants to know
when the old man's going down.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.046
You got me started,
you shouldn't have talked about it.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.255
I got you started?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.840
You asked me a hundred thousand questions.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.425
Okay, never mind, forget it.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.261
Ooh, kind of rough on me.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.055
So what are you going to do
for me in return, huh?

22:28.138 --> 22:29.514
-You're going to give me a little sugar?
-Maybe.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.515
A little sugar?

22:32.225 --> 22:33.060
-Maybe?
-Maybe.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.227
-Maybe?
-Yeah.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.854
Come here, come here.

22:35.937 --> 22:37.105
-Come here, my little girl.
-Dom!

22:37.189 --> 22:40.359
My little convent girl
from the convent school.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.526
What do you say we do it, huh?

22:41.610 --> 22:43.028
-Dom!
-We do it.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.237
Come on. Let's do it.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.239
Let's do it while
the old man's getting hit, okay?

22:46.323 --> 22:49.493
-Dom, don't!
-Huh? (laughs) Come on.

22:49.576 --> 22:54.414
I got 25 grand that makes him dead
before he gets inside,

22:54.748 --> 22:57.125
before noon,
while he's doing his big shot...

22:57.209 --> 22:58.543
(speaks Italian) ...at the <i>bocce</i> court.

22:58.627 --> 23:01.129
-Dom, don't.
-Come on, you know you want it.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.756
-No! No!
-You know you want to do it.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.466
So, let's do it. You said you want--

23:04.549 --> 23:06.885
-Come on, you'll like it.
-No, no!

23:10.597 --> 23:12.474
(men cheering)

23:17.562 --> 23:20.607
Sergeant Bates calling Officer Flaherty.

23:20.690 --> 23:22.859
(imitates static) Come in, Sarge.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.820
Ranks, Officer, <i>capisce?</i>

23:25.445 --> 23:26.279
<i>Capisce.</i>

23:27.239 --> 23:28.240
Proceed?

23:28.615 --> 23:31.701
Our assignment is traffic control.

23:31.785 --> 23:34.079
Our assignment is not drawing bullseyes.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.540
Our assignment is not getting
in Uncle John's face.

23:36.623 --> 23:37.874
We're part of the scenery.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.669
-Is that a copy I'm getting, Officer?
-That's a copy.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.921
We're supposed to blend in and keep quiet.

23:43.004 --> 23:44.798
But bullseye,
wasn't that a little funny, huh?

23:44.881 --> 23:47.092
See, there's a threat
on Uncle John's life, right,

23:47.175 --> 23:48.635
and I made a little bullseye.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.095
I understood.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.641
I was laughing but I was not amused.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.144
Not amused?

23:58.353 --> 23:59.271
That's a copy.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.906
(Dom humming in the shower)

24:22.252 --> 24:23.295
It's Russo.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.882
Give me Lieutenant Goldblume.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.008
Go ahead.

24:28.091 --> 24:30.260
HENRY: <i>More specific information</i>
<i>is the tab on your uncle</i>

24:30.343 --> 24:32.012
<i>will take place before 12:00 p.m.</i>

24:32.095 --> 24:34.139
<i>-Possibility the attempt...</i>
-Seventeen minutes.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.974
<i>-...will be at the lawn bowling court...</i>
-(chattering)

24:36.057 --> 24:37.434
That's here, that's now.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.687
MAN: Hey, cool it, cool it, cool it.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.234
Don't anybody try me,
I'll blow his heart away

24:46.318 --> 24:47.360
and everybody else's, too.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.988
How's it feel, Uncle John, huh?
You want to get it right now, huh?

24:50.071 --> 24:51.740
Come on, come on,
don't be crazy, will you?

24:51.823 --> 24:53.533
-Easy, take it easy, kid.
-Don't!

24:53.617 --> 24:55.285
Don't-- I mean it, I mean it.

24:55.368 --> 24:57.871
-Okay, just take it easy.
-MAN: Stand back.

25:00.707 --> 25:03.335
You stand back, me and John,
we got places to go.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.337
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You crazy, kid?

25:05.420 --> 25:07.005
-Hey, do I know you?
-Shut up!

25:10.467 --> 25:11.510
Right on time.

25:12.135 --> 25:14.387
Yeah, right, that had all the marks
of an outfit move, huh?

25:14.471 --> 25:15.430
Think it wasn't a mob hitter?

25:15.514 --> 25:16.723
Just get in the car.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.605
(people chattering)

25:28.443 --> 25:30.612
Come on, come on,
let's move it back, come on.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.948
...Mr. Petruzzi.
If Mr. Petruzzi gets hurt--

25:33.031 --> 25:35.825
We understand your concern,
but you must move back, Sal.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.619
Hey, quite calling me Sal!

25:38.411 --> 25:41.456
-Why do I think your name is Sal?
-Right this way.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.709
Patrick.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.128
Kid's got Uncle John, second floor, front.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.172
He was yelling his head off
till a minute ago.

25:49.256 --> 25:52.092
-He was threatening to kill the old man.
-Empty promises.

25:52.175 --> 25:55.428
He was going on how his sister died
from Uncle John's drugs.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.472
He's got to kill the old man
in the exact spot

25:57.556 --> 25:59.099
where his sister OD'd.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.976
Kids been watching too much opera.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.646
Wilcox, Lieutenant Goldblume.
Division hitters?

26:05.438 --> 26:06.398
Can we get a phone patch?

26:06.481 --> 26:08.858
Any second. My men are deployed.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.571
-A dozen cracker jack shooters.
-Let's work on the phone.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.030
I'm a cracker jack talker.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.991
Makes 13 shooters, Lieutenant,

26:16.074 --> 26:19.202
counting the contract killer
who so says Dom Donatelli hired him.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.453
You think he's still out there, Norm?

26:20.996 --> 26:22.831
Those contracts only pay on delivery.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.833
Hard to believe a pro would try a hit
with this many cops around.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.459
Yeah, tell Joe Colombo.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.670
Phone's patched in, sir.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.465
Car's registered to an Anthony Peruzzia.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.344
Mention a murder suicide to the kid.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.556
You know, tell him he does himself,
does the old man,

26:39.639 --> 26:41.099
something in that order, huh.

26:42.475 --> 26:46.479
Hello, who am I talking to?
Is this Anthony Peruzzia?

26:47.272 --> 26:50.191
I knew that man was trouble.
What kind I didn't know.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.152
What kind?

26:52.235 --> 26:54.112
Mr. Emili's suspected
of a number of crimes.

26:54.195 --> 26:56.323
(chuckles) This was a sandwich once.

26:56.406 --> 26:59.534
What can you tell us about him, ma'am?
What kind of hours did he keep?

26:59.618 --> 27:00.660
I didn't watch.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.288
-He talk about where he went, what he did?
-Never.

27:03.371 --> 27:05.206
But I knew I'd be standing here
someday, with police.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.209
Neal, newspaper clippings.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.420
Clippings of what, I ask myself.

27:10.503 --> 27:12.213
I had a better class of people once.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.175
"Slayer slays six-- California."

27:15.258 --> 27:17.260
Yeah, closer to home-- Ernestine Carter,

27:17.344 --> 27:19.471
-Sonya Appleman.
-Bingo.

27:19.554 --> 27:20.805
He played bingo?

27:21.181 --> 27:22.766
We'll be carting this box
and the rest of this stuff

27:22.849 --> 27:24.100
out this afternoon, ma'am.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.394
For that, I'll have to see
your warrant again.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.105
-Neal, look. Hey.
-They all matched.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.650
Is that the Schneider boy,
or is that the Schneider boy?

27:40.116 --> 27:41.451
What's the matter, Ray?

27:41.534 --> 27:42.452
What do you mean?

27:42.535 --> 27:44.245
Daniels describes what you've been doing,

27:44.329 --> 27:46.164
and I can't believe
he's talking about you.

27:46.247 --> 27:48.166
You mean because
I've been showing backbone?

27:48.541 --> 27:50.377
Because I have answered back to him?

27:50.460 --> 27:52.796
Trying to get fired?
Is that what's behind this?

27:52.879 --> 27:54.089
WAITRESS: Ready, gentlemen?

27:54.172 --> 27:56.174
Uh, give us just a minute,
would you, please?

27:56.257 --> 27:57.467
WAITRESS: Okay, fine.

28:00.804 --> 28:03.223
From the day I received my captaincy,

28:03.306 --> 28:05.433
I have never once slept through the night.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.977
-I understand.
-You don't.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.980
For you, command comes naturally.

28:11.064 --> 28:14.317
For me, I survived too long

28:14.401 --> 28:16.778
by understanding
the other man's point of view.

28:18.321 --> 28:22.784
And when it came time for me to lead,
I saw too many sides of every question.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.705
And then I didn't have
the courage to quit.

28:26.788 --> 28:29.082
When my prison was taken from me,

28:29.165 --> 28:31.543
instead of leaving as I should have,

28:32.460 --> 28:35.880
I took this crap, this joke of a job.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.049
I don't think
that's what the job has to be,

28:38.133 --> 28:40.635
but if that's the way you feel about it,
maybe you should resign.

28:40.719 --> 28:44.305
You don't understand
how deep the feeling is with us...

28:46.015 --> 28:47.392
to keep any job,

28:48.393 --> 28:51.020
to fear the unknown, but you're right,

28:51.104 --> 28:52.272
I should.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.317
Help me be brave.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.199
-Hey, you're gonna wear out, J.D.
-I hate polygraphs.

29:03.283 --> 29:06.745
-You know, you ain't the one taking it.
-How do you think he's doing, Neal?

29:06.828 --> 29:08.079
Well, I'd only be guessing, man.

29:08.163 --> 29:09.831
I'm telling you, even if he's guilty,

29:09.914 --> 29:11.958
this Max Emili's
the kind of nervous little twitch

29:12.041 --> 29:14.002
that a lie detector test will screw up.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.506
-How'd he do, Mr. Bernstein?
-He's a tough read.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.177
On 16 different capital acts,
he demonstrates guilt or guilty knowledge.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.179
-So we're in business.
-But his reaction to the test question

29:24.262 --> 29:26.973
was so idiosyncratic
that the baseline's bizarre.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.350
Well, you're not dealing
with a flake here, guys.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.227
Well, where do we stand, Mr. Bernstein?

29:31.728 --> 29:33.730
He either did it
or he's a can't-be-tested.

29:33.813 --> 29:38.026
Your man is definitely a possible,
on Schneider, Winthrop, Carter.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.235
Thanks for all the help.

29:40.528 --> 29:41.613
Where we going, J.D.?

29:41.696 --> 29:44.574
We are dropping a dime
to certain journalists in my acquaintance.

29:44.657 --> 29:46.868
The guy didn't exactly give us
the full speed ahead, you know.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.703
Forget about the polygraph guy, Neal.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.038
They're dealing with a total bing-bong,

29:50.121 --> 29:52.248
and they want him to test
like the man in the street.

29:52.332 --> 29:55.543
I think we better wait for forensics
and the family witnesses.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.961
Captain said take it by the numbers.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.546
Hey, the numbers I'm thinking about

29:58.630 --> 30:00.548
all got dollar signs
in front of them, Neal.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.425
Yeah, Jerry Wilmont please.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.678
You should have seen this guy out there.
This guy was great.

30:06.304 --> 30:09.224
-Well done, Stanislav.
-STAN: Oh, I just got lucky out there.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.518
After all, it's not like
it's the first perp I ever saw.

30:11.601 --> 30:15.021
Are you kidding?
I could barely keep up with this guy.

30:15.939 --> 30:17.065
What's the matter, son?

30:18.650 --> 30:21.861
Oh, I'm a little rankled
about our heater deployment

30:21.945 --> 30:23.780
at that Petruzzi messiness.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.033
You know, I'm armchair quarterbacking.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.244
Hard to get used to
being on the sidelines, isn't it?

30:29.327 --> 30:30.203
Message for me?

30:30.286 --> 30:32.497
Oh, forensics wants you
to call them, Detective.

30:33.331 --> 30:37.418
-Say, Sarge.
-Neal, Neal, Stan just made a collar.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.629
-No kidding.
-Yeah, I just got lucky.

30:39.712 --> 30:42.924
-Once a cop, right?
-(laughs)

30:43.007 --> 30:44.968
Jimmy, J.D. LaRue.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.970
It's a business call.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.722
Career call maybe for both of us.

30:50.431 --> 30:54.519
I'm talking about an exclusive
on a possible mass murderer, Jimbo.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.397
Yeah, me and Neal Washington
popped him a few hours ago.

30:58.189 --> 31:03.194
Huh? Yeah. Yes, I did call Jerry Wilmont
before I called you.

31:03.278 --> 31:06.030
But Jerry Wilmont
couldn't buy my ground rules

31:06.114 --> 31:07.240
for the slant of the piece.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.409
So now instead of having
his hands wrapped around

31:09.492 --> 31:10.869
maybe the hottest mass murder story

31:10.952 --> 31:13.955
since that creep in Florida,
Jerry Wilmont's got his hands

31:14.038 --> 31:16.082
wrapped around the morning
<i>Courier Express.</i>

31:16.165 --> 31:17.166
-J.D.
-In a minute, huh?

31:17.250 --> 31:19.627
-Hang up.
-Just a second, Jim. What?

31:19.878 --> 31:22.255
That picture we found,
Max Emili and the kid.

31:22.338 --> 31:25.174
-Yeah, what about it?
-Well, forensics says we've got problems.

31:26.259 --> 31:29.596
Ah, I'll get back to you, Jimmy.
Something came up on another case.

31:30.346 --> 31:33.016
-What problems?
-They say this picture of Max Emili

31:33.099 --> 31:35.602
with the Schneider kid,
they say it might be a composite.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.313
What composite, where's the join?

31:38.396 --> 31:40.231
They say it might be
a picture of a picture, J.D.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.941
Well, that's crap.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.276
-Uh-huh.
-Easy.

31:43.359 --> 31:44.736
That the Schneider boy's father.

31:44.819 --> 31:47.405
-Uh, Detective.
-Mr. Schneider.

31:47.488 --> 31:51.200
I was told there might be information
about my son, about his killer.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.369
Well, we have a possible suspect, sir.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.913
We wanted you to see
if you might recognize him.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.707
Oh, yeah, fine.

31:57.790 --> 31:59.125
We'll set up a lineup.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.253
Of course, now,
even if you didn't recognize him,

32:02.337 --> 32:03.880
that wouldn't necessarily mean anything.

32:03.963 --> 32:07.050
I know, the idea's been the killer
probably wasn't known by our family.

32:07.133 --> 32:09.844
That's right, I mean,
this guy could still be a candidate.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.514
-(man on radio indistinct)
-Ludicrous. Unfathomable.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.350
Hope and pray, Sal.

32:16.142 --> 32:19.604
That's all we can do now
is just hope and pray.

32:21.689 --> 32:25.693
If you hurt Petruzzi, Tony,
it's a different ballgame.

32:26.235 --> 32:28.571
I mean, nothing's happened
so far we can't fix.

32:28.863 --> 32:32.659
-Lieutenant, maybe the hitter's split.
-Lose his 20 Gs.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.119
TONY (on phone): <i>Who's going to fix things</i>
<i>for my sister, Doria, huh?</i>

32:35.203 --> 32:36.454
Forget your sister.

32:37.413 --> 32:39.749
Is that old man there
worth ruining your life over?

32:40.708 --> 32:43.211
BUNTZ: That's Russo
with her boyfriend Dominic.

32:43.294 --> 32:46.130
Mr. Donatelli
should've asked me to bid the work.

32:49.509 --> 32:52.679
Mr. Donatelli's expression
is called the oops look.

32:52.762 --> 32:55.223
Like, "Oops, did I overplay my hand?"

32:56.099 --> 32:57.517
Hey, check Russo.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.103
She plays it out, huh?

33:01.521 --> 33:03.356
Got to give her credit for her stones.

33:04.065 --> 33:06.985
You know, it might do her some good
to hear some of that, Lieutenant.

33:10.655 --> 33:11.698
He's coming out.

33:11.781 --> 33:13.574
I want your men
on either side of the door.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.492
But keep them off.

33:15.618 --> 33:19.163
-MAN: He's coming out! He's coming out!
-Tony, put the gun down!

33:19.247 --> 33:21.708
I don't know, I don't know what to do.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.501
Got a clear shot, Lieutenant.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.713
Give him to us. Put him away.

33:26.796 --> 33:28.256
OFFICER: Lieutenant,
look at the water tower.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.882
-HENRY: Tony.
-Come on, give me a rifle.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.884
He's going to jail, Tony, I promise you.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.595
I got him, somebody take--

33:34.679 --> 33:36.556
(gun fires)

33:43.521 --> 33:46.315
Look at that rifle. Look at that suit.

33:46.816 --> 33:50.403
You see a possible link
with the alleged mafia, huh?

33:50.486 --> 33:52.822
(helicopter overhead)

33:52.905 --> 33:54.699
Whew, head first.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.037
Mr. Petruzzi will be going
to federal correctional.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.330
We're going to hold him
for the federal marshal.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.502
And local law enforcement for Mr. Peruzzia

34:06.586 --> 34:08.671
Kidnapping, attempted murder,
reckless endangerment.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.423
PETRUZZI: You didn't have the hair
to do it, did you, kid?

34:10.506 --> 34:12.091
If you was a man, you would have done it!

34:12.175 --> 34:13.843
Mr. Petruzzi, calm down.

34:17.555 --> 34:19.140
-Lieutenant.
-No questions now.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.224
It's not a question.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.936
I've got an invitation you've been ducking
for <i>The Don Chesler Show</i> tonight.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.147
-You've got to be kidding.
-No.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.569
Uncle John, I'm so glad you're okay.

34:34.238 --> 34:36.574
Of course you are, Dominic.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.076
Of course you are.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.037
Yeah, stay healthy, Dom.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.997
Crime scene, sir, come on, let's go.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.208
Folks, help me out.

34:48.044 --> 34:49.378
I'll go to my mother's.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.340
-Okay, go on, go ahead.
-Okay.

34:53.841 --> 34:55.134
Look at this, Tin.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.220
Look what happened to me.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.347
I know, Dom.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.021
Andrew, what's wrong with your nose?

35:08.022 --> 35:09.148
My word.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.567
I almost expired, Sarge,
I got some kind of intergalactic--

35:11.651 --> 35:14.028
He got a bee bite, Sarge.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.072
Anaphylactic reaction, really.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.783
That's right, that's what the doctor
said at the emergency room.

35:18.866 --> 35:22.120
It is a mistake to underestimate
the possible severity

35:22.203 --> 35:24.497
of allergic reactions, Robert.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.499
Extreme cases can be fatal.

35:26.582 --> 35:29.836
Sarge, the only extreme thing
about this case

35:29.919 --> 35:32.588
is how much somebody's been
gold bricking all day.

35:32.672 --> 35:35.049
That's right, this man's a rational man.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.634
Robert Hill don't cotton
to how all of a sudden

35:36.717 --> 35:39.220
one's life can change
with a dark shadow coming over him.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.514
Oh, I take it, Andrew,
that you are referring to the curse

35:41.597 --> 35:43.558
that was inadvertently administered
by the gypsy this morning.

35:43.641 --> 35:47.145
-Yes, I am.
-A so-called gypsy, so-called curse.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.230
How would you know about it?
You're a rational man, aren't you?

35:49.313 --> 35:50.731
-Yeah...
-You're some kind of rational man--

35:50.815 --> 35:54.277
Careful, Renko! (laughing)

35:54.360 --> 35:55.444
Bulb burnt out.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.238
I didn't want you
walking underneath the ladder.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.031
You could get 20 years bad luck.

35:59.115 --> 36:02.076
(laughing)

36:06.664 --> 36:10.334
Oh, Howard, do we have
Henry's racketeering warrants

36:10.418 --> 36:12.295
-so I can co-sign them?
-Not as yet.

36:12.378 --> 36:15.173
All right, I'll be at division the rest
of the day with Captain Calletano.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.091
Just ship them over there
or to my apartment.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.594
Well, this came
from the department physician, Captain.

36:21.596 --> 36:24.807
-Uh, 30 seconds, Captain?
-Yeah, 30 seconds, Stan.

36:24.891 --> 36:28.102
-I want my reinstatement.
-Stan, I told you, I need a few days.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.979
Yeah, I know, I just
wanted to say you may hear

36:30.062 --> 36:32.064
that I helped out on a pop this afternoon.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.733
Thought you might be able to figure it in.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.318
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about,

36:35.401 --> 36:37.236
but I promise you it'll be figured in.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.738
-Excuse me, Stan.
-Oh, go ahead.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.740
Catch of the day, Captain.

36:40.823 --> 36:43.951
A kid who grabbed Petruzzi,
suitable for stuffing and mounting.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.788
-How's Russo?
-Seems to be okay. (coughs)

36:47.872 --> 36:49.373
Good work, Lucy, Patrick.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.293
Henry, warrants?

36:52.376 --> 36:53.753
On their way back from Judge Simpson's.

36:53.836 --> 36:57.215
Uh, they got me to do
this idiot talk show.

36:58.966 --> 37:01.302
-Nice work, Tina.
-Tina...

37:02.845 --> 37:05.556
-You have a couple of minutes?
-Sure.

37:14.857 --> 37:15.858
Are you okay?

37:16.692 --> 37:19.987
I just received a notification report
from the police physician.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.698
-Says he saw you for having been beaten.
-I'm okay.

37:23.824 --> 37:26.827
-Dom got a little excited.
-Is that as far as it went?

37:28.079 --> 37:31.082
You mean did I sleep with him
for the where and when?

37:32.166 --> 37:33.960
Did I break Furillo's law?

37:34.043 --> 37:37.338
Tina, the doctor speculates
you may also have been sexually assaulted.

37:37.421 --> 37:40.091
But you refused examination or treatment.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.218
I'm okay.

37:43.552 --> 37:44.887
If Donatelli raped you,

37:44.971 --> 37:47.181
I want to charge him with it
when we bring him in.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.850
Plus, you should also get some counseling.

37:50.184 --> 37:53.729
Just promise me I get to be in
on Donatelli's arrest.

37:55.523 --> 37:58.192
You know you're doing
the toughest police work there is.

38:00.236 --> 38:03.155
But at least you get the respect
of your fellow cops.

38:11.872 --> 38:15.126
I'll tell you something, Neal.
You get lied to a lot in this racket.

38:15.209 --> 38:16.961
You teach yourself to get used to it.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.089
But I bought Max Emili, I trusted the man.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.549
Oh, look at here.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.551
Four years in Glenwood Psychiatric.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.678
That 86's him out of all
but two of the murders.

38:25.761 --> 38:28.180
Hm, I got some more bad news
for you, too, lover.

38:28.472 --> 38:32.435
Forensics found the original of that photo
with Max and the Schneider kid.

38:32.518 --> 38:35.313
And it was in one of those boxes
of stuff they found in the room.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.897
-Glued?
-Glued.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.942
-Thanks, Pepe.
-You want the rest of this?

38:40.318 --> 38:42.153
Why be a glutton for punishment?

38:43.738 --> 38:45.197
(crying)

38:45.281 --> 38:47.199
Oh, excuse me.

38:47.783 --> 38:49.368
Uh...

38:49.452 --> 38:51.495
I misplaced, um...

38:51.579 --> 38:54.498
Oh, Sergeant Jablonski and I--

38:54.582 --> 38:58.210
Retired Sergeant Jablonski,
we made an arrest,

38:58.294 --> 39:00.713
and I used this room
for intake on the perp.

39:00.796 --> 39:07.386
And I somehow misplaced
case notes from an original arrest,

39:07.678 --> 39:10.348
uh, that was totally unrelated
to this matter,

39:10.431 --> 39:14.185
and I was testifying
to that in court this morning,

39:14.268 --> 39:16.187
prior to this other incident so...

39:16.771 --> 39:19.523
I, ah, just came in here to look for them.

39:19.607 --> 39:23.235
-Are they here?
-No, they're not. Um...

39:26.197 --> 39:27.323
How'd you get that shiner?

39:28.449 --> 39:29.784
A jerk on my undercover.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.119
Yeah, when do you pop him?

39:33.079 --> 39:33.913
Tomorrow.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.624
I don't know if this will work for you.

39:36.707 --> 39:41.462
But I try to think about that,
about when I'm gonna bust him.

39:41.879 --> 39:45.383
I just wish the other cops around here
wouldn't treat me like Typhoid Mary.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.261
Ah, hey, don't-- don't do that.

39:49.970 --> 39:52.306
-I'm sorry.
-No, don't apologize.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.433
You don't have to apologize.

39:58.604 --> 39:59.438
Were you going home?

40:03.067 --> 40:04.485
Would you like to have a beer?

40:05.444 --> 40:07.238
Hm? Want to go out and have a beer?

40:09.990 --> 40:12.576
Hey, this guy makes me sick.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.704
-I agree, Detective, I loathe myself.
-Shut up, shut up!

40:15.788 --> 40:18.040
-I killed them all!
-(overlapping chatter)

40:18.124 --> 40:19.792
All of us are responsible!

40:19.875 --> 40:23.587
...that old lady. Yeah, I got one
I'd like to be responsible for.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.381
All right, all right, come on.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.759
A Jim Girardi calling you, Detective,
from <i>The Post-Gazette.</i>

40:28.843 --> 40:30.094
Tell him I died.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.100
I thought it finally was gonna be over.

40:37.601 --> 40:40.271
I thought I'd finally know
how we lost Tommy.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.613
Look at this, Frank, can you believe this?

40:49.697 --> 40:51.031
Man says he's leaving.

40:51.115 --> 40:54.118
I can't believe you're so surprised,
Chief Daniels.

40:54.201 --> 40:57.496
-Did you know about this, Frank?
-Ray said at lunch he decided to resign.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.331
(exhales) Bolt from the blue.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.667
Chief, both of us know
I have not been happy,

41:01.750 --> 41:03.502
not doing a very good job.

41:03.586 --> 41:06.589
A transitional adjustment, Ray.
You're too hard on yourself.

41:06.672 --> 41:09.049
I have been angry and disappointed.

41:09.133 --> 41:12.386
It is better for me to quit
than behave as I have been.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.723
Look, it's your call.

41:16.223 --> 41:18.559
If it's what you want,
I certainly won't prevent it.

41:19.393 --> 41:23.105
Only understand, there's been no duress.

41:23.856 --> 41:26.150
No, no duress.

41:27.401 --> 41:28.944
Hell of a guy, eh, Frank?

41:30.154 --> 41:33.532
Nice, uh, nice take down on Uncle John.

41:39.288 --> 41:43.417
Sometimes at night,
I have dreamt of killing that man.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.585
Did you get caught?

41:46.879 --> 41:48.255
What is it with you?

41:49.089 --> 41:51.550
Guys like Uncle John wind my watch.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.052
Patrick.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.262
Makes the day go quicker.

41:56.263 --> 41:58.349
-Mm.
-My teacher used to say that to me.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.101
-Mrs. Murphy.
-What?

42:01.435 --> 42:02.978
What you said to me before.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.815
I'm laughing, but I'm not amused.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.693
(laughing)

42:09.777 --> 42:12.404
So, now what are you trying to say to me,
that I'm so much older than you are?

42:12.488 --> 42:15.241
No, no I was just remembering, that's all.

42:16.450 --> 42:18.118
I liked Mrs. Murphy.

42:20.246 --> 42:23.499
-Hey, Mr. Goldfarb.
-Name is Bilbao.

42:23.874 --> 42:28.629
-Oh, right, Bilbao.
-Please, before the curse is removed.

42:31.715 --> 42:34.552
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

42:34.635 --> 42:37.596
-Where is the afflicted party?
-Right over this way.

42:37.680 --> 42:38.556
Renko...

42:41.183 --> 42:42.434
You got a lot of nerve.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.687
I'm here to assist you, Officer.

42:44.770 --> 42:48.107
He's going to take it off of you, Renko,
not that anything was ever on you.

42:48.190 --> 42:49.525
Yeah, yeah, go.

42:49.984 --> 42:52.319
-Go on.
-Okay.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.530
Okay, what am I supposed to do?

42:55.114 --> 42:56.407
Okay.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.869
-Okay, what are you going to do?
-Okay, it's off!

43:03.956 --> 43:05.457
(laughing)

43:07.376 --> 43:09.003
You ain't going to believe it, Neal.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.298
I'm in the john,
trying to decide not to rip off my arm

43:12.381 --> 43:13.966
and beat myself to death with it.

43:14.049 --> 43:17.219
I find that telephone number I lost,
the chick I went out with last night.

43:17.303 --> 43:19.597
See that, lover,
every cloud has a silver lining.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.099
Mm. No, Neal, I called the number.

43:23.058 --> 43:24.977
-No good?
-Disconnected.

43:27.646 --> 43:29.565
Maybe she had a social disease.

43:31.108 --> 43:34.903
Of course, if she had a social disease,
I probably already got a dose.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.115
We're back.

43:39.033 --> 43:42.453
Something we should get to about the death
of Steven Merkur, Lieutenant,

43:42.536 --> 43:44.371
about your involvement with Steve.

43:44.913 --> 43:46.373
Is that a dilemma for you?

43:47.207 --> 43:48.042
What dilemma?

43:48.542 --> 43:51.462
That he was a friend of yours,
a good friend, a close friend.

43:51.545 --> 43:54.048
-That's right.
-And yet as a police officer,

43:54.131 --> 43:55.841
you must disapprove of this vigilante.

43:55.924 --> 43:57.468
(stuttering) Wait a second.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.095
-I don't see Steve that way.
-Go ahead.

44:01.680 --> 44:02.848
Steve had a dream.

44:03.390 --> 44:06.101
-To see our streets free of terror.
-To write.

44:07.269 --> 44:08.729
He wrote in obscurity.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.357
He got a lot of slaps
in the face and rejections,

44:11.440 --> 44:13.108
but it didn't stop him.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.152
And that was why Steven was heroic.

44:16.278 --> 44:20.157
Because despite all that discouragement,
he stayed true to his dream.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.409
And have you read this brave man's pages?

44:22.493 --> 44:23.327
Yes.

44:24.453 --> 44:25.788
-Yes.
-Good?

44:27.665 --> 44:30.084
-Worthy of the hero who wrote them, then.
-Yes.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.713
I have a feeling Steven Merkur
had a very good friend in you, Lieutenant.

44:35.339 --> 44:38.258
Lieutenant Goldblume
is reluctant to bring this up,

44:39.051 --> 44:42.012
but the man sitting here,
himself, played the role of hero

44:42.096 --> 44:44.473
at the Blanton Street
hostage situation today,

44:44.556 --> 44:48.227
involving the famous,
or perhaps I should say notorious,

44:48.310 --> 44:49.520
Uncle John Petruzzi.

44:49.603 --> 44:53.148
A lot of us feel a lot safer
and perhaps a little bit prouder

44:53.232 --> 44:55.693
knowing our city
has law enforcement officers

44:55.776 --> 44:58.737
of the caliber of the gentleman
I'm sitting next to.

44:58.821 --> 45:00.197
(applause)

45:00.280 --> 45:02.991
HOST: <i>Don's guest tomorrow night</i>
<i>are health experts</i>

45:03.075 --> 45:04.952
<i>Dick and Laine Coppernaul.</i>

45:07.746 --> 45:09.873
-How was Henry?
-Good.

45:11.959 --> 45:16.880
Don Chesler thinks the city is safer
with cops like him on the force.

45:18.424 --> 45:19.842
Job for you, Furillo.

45:21.051 --> 45:22.219
How are the benefits?

45:23.637 --> 45:25.973
It's a spot needs kneading.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.725
Mm.

45:27.808 --> 45:29.685
Yeah. (moans)

45:30.769 --> 45:34.189
(moaning) Brother.

45:35.232 --> 45:39.778
-All those years of making dough.
-(laughing)

45:42.698 --> 45:44.032
Actually he wasn't.

45:45.784 --> 45:48.537
-Who wasn't what?
-Henry wasn't good.

45:49.246 --> 45:52.291
I mean, he was fine,
but I just kept thinking

45:52.374 --> 45:55.294
how lonely and uptight he seemed.

45:58.213 --> 45:59.631
You know what Henry needs?

46:01.216 --> 46:02.092
Yep.

46:05.971 --> 46:07.765
Mm...

46:07.848 --> 46:11.101
Let's get into that benefit package.

46:13.645 --> 46:15.731
-Nice spot, Lieutenant.
-Thank you.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.066
His stuff stinks, huh?

46:19.026 --> 46:21.153
-What do you mean?
-Your friend's writing.

46:21.737 --> 46:23.530
I could see you
get those scared deer's eyes

46:23.614 --> 46:25.532
when I asked if it was any good.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.326
-Night, Dots.
-Night, Don.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.997
You were great. He really loved you.

46:32.581 --> 46:34.958
-Oh, boy.
-No, I mean it.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.251
You were right there.

46:36.502 --> 46:38.837
So many guest get all tied up in the buzz.

46:39.254 --> 46:41.215
Whereas I don't really
know what that means.

46:41.298 --> 46:43.383
Hm, so don't take a compliment.

46:44.301 --> 46:47.054
I still don't know
how you got me to do this.

46:47.137 --> 46:49.598
(chuckles)
Well, it's what I'm good at.

46:49.681 --> 46:50.724
Yeah.

46:54.102 --> 46:55.687
I know what you need now, too.

46:56.897 --> 46:57.940
Yeah, what?

46:58.023 --> 47:02.152
Well, aren't you still feeling
pretty wound up, jazzed?

47:05.447 --> 47:07.366
A drink, minimum.

47:09.952 --> 47:12.871
You mean at least one drink?

47:15.415 --> 47:16.625
I'm not sure what I mean.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.879
Undercover is different.

47:21.755 --> 47:27.928
Because if you're good at it,
most times nobody else knows

47:29.179 --> 47:30.973
the inside of what you did.

47:31.807 --> 47:33.058
So you got to know.

47:33.892 --> 47:37.187
And you got to find a way
to make that enough.

47:38.105 --> 47:39.523
It's not for everybody.

47:41.567 --> 47:42.734
It's what I want to be.

47:46.238 --> 47:47.322
This will help.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.617
I'll take you back to your car now.

48:03.839 --> 48:06.842
(closing theme playing)
