WEBVTT

00:06.125 --> 00:07.959
- You're late.
- For what?

00:08.041 --> 00:10.583
Rudy's surprise birthday party, remember?

00:10.667 --> 00:13.333
The one he's been planning
for himself for two weeks?

00:19.542 --> 00:21.000
<i>He's coming.</i>

00:26.291 --> 00:28.250
Surprise.

00:30.959 --> 00:33.041
How did you know it was my birthday?

00:33.125 --> 00:34.875
Are you guys trying to kill me?

00:37.917 --> 00:40.166
You'd better not have brought gifts.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.125
But if you did,
now would be the time to load me up.

00:44.458 --> 00:46.125
Hey, man, I don't have anything.

00:46.208 --> 00:47.250
Can I get in on your gift, please?

00:47.375 --> 00:48.917
Absolutely not.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.417
I put a lot of time,
thought and effort into this.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.792
This is from Jerry, Eddie and me.

00:57.333 --> 01:01.333
Oh, joke-a-day toilet paper. Get out.

01:03.208 --> 01:04.458
My cousin had this at his house.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.834
I literally laughed myself off the bowl.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.417
Thank you, guys.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.375
Now,

01:11.458 --> 01:14.250
I don't want to turn this whole gift thing
into a competition,

01:14.333 --> 01:18.041
but, Kim, it's time to top that gift.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.375
Kim, do you think I could get in on your--

01:21.458 --> 01:22.667
Forget it, Jack.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.083
I've got a winner right here.

01:26.083 --> 01:28.875
Unlike some people,
I put a lot of thought into my gift.

01:29.625 --> 01:31.000
I hope you like it, Rudy.

01:36.083 --> 01:39.375
A signed picture of Bobby Wasabi,

01:40.583 --> 01:42.542
my hero, my idol,

01:42.625 --> 01:44.125
the man I patterned my life after?

01:45.208 --> 01:48.458
"To whom it may concern, Bobby Wasabi."

01:49.375 --> 01:50.959
That's me.

01:51.041 --> 01:53.667
I'm whom. I'm concerned.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.542
All right, Jack.

01:58.625 --> 02:00.500
Rock my world.

02:03.375 --> 02:06.709
Yeah, Jack, I'm sure Rudy
saved the best for last.

02:08.917 --> 02:11.750
Well, you know,

02:11.834 --> 02:13.041
I was thinking

02:13.125 --> 02:15.709
you know, everyone knows how much
you love Bobby Wasabi.

02:15.792 --> 02:19.500
And I asked myself what could be
better than a picture, right?

02:19.583 --> 02:20.959
Only the man himself.

02:22.125 --> 02:23.583
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

02:23.667 --> 02:25.458
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

02:25.542 --> 02:27.625
You found a way
Tt get Bobby Wasabi to come down here

02:27.709 --> 02:28.792
So I could meet him?

02:29.625 --> 02:30.834
Yeah.

02:31.917 --> 02:35.875
Wait, the founder of this dojo,
an international movie star,

02:35.959 --> 02:37.750
someone who hasn't been
seen in public in 20 years

02:37.834 --> 02:39.166
is coming to see me?

02:39.959 --> 02:41.375
I can't believe it.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.542
None of us can believe it, Jack.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.792
Let's get this party started.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.458
- Whoa, whoa!

03:39.166 --> 03:43.083
I cannot believe you
told Rudy that Bobby Wasabi was coming.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.458
I couldn't believe it either.

03:44.542 --> 03:49.458
Words just kept exploding out of me.
It's like I had a case of liarrhea.

03:50.417 --> 03:53.792
He's never gonna show, Jack.
And Rudy's gonna be crushed.

03:53.875 --> 03:57.125
Bobby could show.
I mean, my grandfather was his sensei.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.417
I found his number
and I left him a message.

03:59.917 --> 04:01.500
This could be bad.

04:01.583 --> 04:03.125
Remember how disappointed Rudy was

04:03.208 --> 04:05.959
when he lost the name-the-baby-panda
contest at the zoo?

04:06.041 --> 04:09.208
Oh, I know. He put on his crying boots.

04:14.125 --> 04:15.417
What are you guys looking at?

04:16.542 --> 04:17.834
We're closed.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.166
I know what I said was wrong.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.417
But, I mean, who's crazy enough to believe

04:24.500 --> 04:27.125
that Bobby Wasabi is actually
coming to our dojo?

04:27.208 --> 04:30.542
I can't believe Bobby Wasabi
is actually coming to our dojo!

04:30.625 --> 04:31.917
Look, Jack.

04:32.417 --> 04:35.417
Bro, since Bobby's coming
for Rudy's birthday,

04:35.500 --> 04:38.875
we've decided to take advantage
of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

04:38.959 --> 04:42.583
We spent the whole night in Jerry's garage
writing his comeback movie.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.000
Wow, you hear that, Jack?

04:45.083 --> 04:49.000
Our friends spent all night in the garage
writing a comeback movie for Bobby Wasabi.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.792
What's bad about that?

04:51.875 --> 04:53.458
What if they wrote a really great movie?

04:53.542 --> 04:56.542
Oh, it's better than great. It's epic.

04:56.625 --> 04:59.875
Bobby Wasabi is the biggest
martial arts action star in history.

04:59.959 --> 05:03.792
But now he'll battle with the most
diabolical force he's ever faced.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.667
It's half piranha, half octopus.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.792
It's Piranhapus!

05:12.125 --> 05:13.917
- Eight arms.
-

05:14.291 --> 05:16.125
- Nine mouths.
-

05:17.125 --> 05:19.041
And one bad attitude.

05:25.083 --> 05:27.041
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

05:27.125 --> 05:30.583
We paid your cousin 50 bucks
to make a model of Piranhapus

05:30.667 --> 05:32.458
And this is what we get?

05:34.458 --> 05:36.333
You should be happy he gave us a deal.

05:36.458 --> 05:38.375
I mean, he took our vision
and brought it to life.

05:39.458 --> 05:43.834
Dude, we can't show
this thing to Bobby Wasabi. It's a joke.

05:43.917 --> 05:45.709
No, you know what's a joke?

05:45.792 --> 05:48.500
That hacky ending you wrote.
Bro, you ruined our movie.

05:48.583 --> 05:52.375
My ending is perfect.
No one could even see it coming.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.041
Of course they can't see it coming.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.959
How does a walrus operate a hang glider?

05:57.834 --> 06:00.750
You know what?
Well, here's what we think of your ending.

06:04.875 --> 06:07.250
That's it.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.625
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

06:11.709 --> 06:13.750
Stop. Get away. Come on.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.917
What is going on?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.750
This Bobby Wasabi movie
is tearing us apart.

06:21.333 --> 06:22.709
Jack, this is crazy.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.500
Just tell them the truth.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.583
You're right.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.625
Guys,

06:29.709 --> 06:32.917
you remember how I said that
Bobby Wasabi was coming down to our dojo?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.083
Yeah.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.792
Well, the truth is...

06:43.333 --> 06:46.333
Hey, beef meats, who do you think you are?

06:52.208 --> 06:53.500
I am...

06:54.625 --> 06:56.917
Bobby Wasabi.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.041
whoa.

07:09.542 --> 07:12.083
Uh, sorry, ma'am, we're closed.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.667
If you're looking
for the large and lovin' it dress shop,

07:15.750 --> 07:17.041
it's on the other side of the mall.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.458
What was that?

07:21.542 --> 07:24.458
Rudy, Rudy, your birthday present's here.

07:24.542 --> 07:26.333
- It's Bobby Wasabi.
- Yeah.

07:26.417 --> 07:28.041
You wanna know why he's here?

07:28.125 --> 07:30.583
Because when I say
I can deliver, what happens?

07:30.667 --> 07:32.917
Oh, that's right. I deliver.

07:33.959 --> 07:35.625
That's a great joke.

07:35.709 --> 07:38.542
You hire some big betty
to squeeze into a dress

07:38.625 --> 07:41.166
and then wobble in here
saying he's Bobby Wasabi.

07:42.625 --> 07:43.917
It is hilarious.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.417
You don't think that I am Bobby Wasabi?

07:48.166 --> 07:50.208
No, ma'am or sir, I do not.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.458
That is it.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.250
Hi-ya-ya-ya-ya-yah!

08:05.917 --> 08:07.959
<i>No, no, no.</i>

08:08.041 --> 08:10.250
- Oh.
-

08:10.333 --> 08:14.166
Rudy, this is no joke.
That really is Bobby Wasabi.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.375
Oh.

08:17.166 --> 08:19.959
Oh. Oh.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.375
Oh, Bobby, I'm sorry, Mr. Wasabi.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.125
Mr. Wasabi, I'm so sorry
for the misunderstanding.

08:26.208 --> 08:29.333
Um, welcome to my dojo.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.875
This is not your dojo.

08:34.959 --> 08:37.959
This is my dojo.

08:38.041 --> 08:41.417
And you are fired.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.417
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you. ♪</i>

08:53.500 --> 08:56.333
Nice birthday present, Jack.
You got Rudy fired.

08:56.417 --> 08:59.166
Maybe next you can give him a balloon
and push him down the stairs.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.542
The worst part is the Bobby Wasabi
comeback movie is dead.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.917
Say goodbye to my Hollywood dream.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.625
What's Rudy gonna do without a job?

09:09.709 --> 09:12.792
He'll be fine.
Guys like Rudy land on their feet.

09:12.875 --> 09:15.667
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's already found a better job.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.041
These are your turtle brushes.

09:20.125 --> 09:22.166
You use this one to clean the mouth

09:22.250 --> 09:24.125
And this one to clean the butt.

09:25.166 --> 09:28.500
Those brushes look a lot alike.
What if I mix them up?

09:28.583 --> 09:30.250
You're not gonna mix them up.

09:30.333 --> 09:33.500
It's terribly obvious.
This one is for the mouth.

09:33.583 --> 09:36.041
This one is-- Oh, dear, it's mine.

09:36.125 --> 09:37.375
Oh.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.834
Oh, not again. Ooh!

09:44.500 --> 09:46.583
Hey guys. What are you doing here?

09:46.667 --> 09:48.375
You know, we just came by
to see how you're doing.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.875
Yeah, don't worry about me.

09:49.959 --> 09:51.000
I'm doing swell--

09:52.000 --> 09:53.125
Swell, I tell you.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.458
Guys, this is my fault.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.250
Rudy's a third-degree black belt,

10:01.375 --> 10:03.417
and now he's scrubbing turtle butt.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.375
Bobby Wasabi took away his job

10:08.125 --> 10:10.291
and Bobby Wasabi is gonna give it back.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.125
He's not answering.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.875
How do we know he's even in there?

10:22.959 --> 10:25.417
Well, someone just ordered
a truckload of pastrami.

10:28.458 --> 10:30.750
Hey, guys, I took three buses to get here,

10:30.834 --> 10:32.417
So we're just gonna have to break in.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.500
Not happening, man. Guys like Wasabi

10:35.583 --> 10:37.417
have million-dollar security systems.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.750
Dude, I'm talking lasers,

10:39.834 --> 10:41.875
motion sensors, surveillance cameras.

10:41.959 --> 10:43.625
This thing's an impenetrable fortress.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.542
Bro, there's no way
we're getting in here--

10:45.625 --> 10:47.000
What's up, Milton? Ever.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.208
Uh-oh.

10:56.458 --> 10:57.375
That's not good.

10:57.458 --> 11:01.125
Oh, come on, it's just one of those
gag signs you buy at the carwash.

11:02.583 --> 11:03.875
Yah!

11:03.959 --> 11:05.583
Jerry, I don't think it's a gag.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.458
- Ninjas!
-

11:14.917 --> 11:17.333
We're trapped. What are we gonna do?

11:17.417 --> 11:20.750
Uh, we're warriors.
It's three of us against one ninja.

11:20.834 --> 11:22.542
We got this, yeah.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.208
You okay, Milton?

11:33.834 --> 11:35.208
I'll tell you this much,

11:35.917 --> 11:37.667
you get wedgied by a ninja,

11:38.500 --> 11:40.625
you don't even see it coming.

11:46.166 --> 11:47.750
Come on. Come on.

11:52.792 --> 11:54.250
Where do you think we are?

11:54.375 --> 11:55.375
I don't know.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.000
I think I found a light switch.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.166
What is this place?

12:13.792 --> 12:17.083
You know, just your average
everyday disco bathroom.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.583
What's up, dude?

12:24.750 --> 12:26.083
Whoa. Come on.

12:28.709 --> 12:32.041
You boys are in so much trouble.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.667
You broke into my house,

12:33.750 --> 12:36.834
which means when I call the police

12:36.917 --> 12:39.250
you are going to jail.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.417
Sausage me.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.166
That's the most incredible
thing I've ever seen.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.375
Sausage me.

12:53.458 --> 12:56.667
Don't you dare sausage him, Evan.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.375
Take them away.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.500
Fine, take us away.

13:01.583 --> 13:05.125
But when we leave,
your big comeback movie leaves with us.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.125
How's that now? What? What?

13:08.917 --> 13:12.291
It just so happens we wrote
the greatest movie of your career.

13:12.417 --> 13:17.375
A little something called
"Bobby Wasabi vs. Piranhapus!"

13:18.834 --> 13:22.000
It's half piranha, half octopus.

13:22.083 --> 13:24.834
So it's a little piranha
with eight tentacles?

13:26.083 --> 13:29.917
Try a giant octopus
with vicious piranha teeth

13:30.000 --> 13:32.583
at the end of each tentacle.

13:32.667 --> 13:35.750
Oh, I want to fight that thing so bad

13:36.709 --> 13:38.583
I can almost taste it.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.625
No, that's a little sausage juice left
in my mustache.

13:50.208 --> 13:51.417
Okay, Lonnie,

13:52.375 --> 13:54.333
I changed the corn lizard's diaper.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.625
Now I know why they call it a corn lizard.

13:57.709 --> 13:58.583
Yeah.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.041
- There you go.
- Oh, yes.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.834
Come here, baby.

14:02.917 --> 14:05.375
Who's your daddy? Mm.

14:05.959 --> 14:09.000
Now feed the Panamanian bush devil.

14:09.083 --> 14:12.083
And be careful. She's a feisty one.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.583
I think I can handle a little bush devil.

14:21.458 --> 14:24.750
Just so you know,
I'm only here temporarily.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.291
Uh, this is a minor setback

14:26.375 --> 14:28.458
in an otherwise illustrious career.

14:29.291 --> 14:31.542
Don't get too attached to this face.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.333
Argh. Argh.

14:34.417 --> 14:37.000
I said do not get attached to the face.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.959
Your fingers are within inches
of an outstretched tentacle--

14:49.750 --> 14:53.041
A tentacle you will never

14:53.125 --> 14:55.625
hold again.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.625
The end.

15:04.625 --> 15:07.291
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.

15:11.041 --> 15:14.125
Either security's been breached
or my pot pie is ready.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.917
Hey, Bobby, I've been looking for you.

15:18.625 --> 15:19.750
Get them!

16:21.917 --> 16:23.583
Hang on a second.

16:23.667 --> 16:27.792
That was a perfect Flying Dragon kick.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.458
My grandfather taught it to me.

16:29.917 --> 16:32.834
Well, I can't think that your grandfather

16:32.917 --> 16:35.333
would approve of you
breaking into my house.

16:37.208 --> 16:40.542
No, but he would approve
of me standing up for my sensei.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.458
Your sensei called me a man lady.

16:46.834 --> 16:48.417
It was an honest mistake.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.208
You've got a ponytail

16:50.250 --> 16:52.750
and that thing you're wearing
kind of looks like a dress.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.709
It's a kaftan.

16:55.792 --> 16:57.709
It's breathable, wrinkle-free

16:57.792 --> 16:59.208
and great for those on-the-go days.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.041
Mr. Wasabi,

17:02.959 --> 17:05.542
what was the one thing
that all of your movies had?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.250
Hot chicks, explosions

17:07.333 --> 17:09.542
and a sassy orangutan sidekick.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.959
Everyone loved Dr. Bananas.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.375
Oh, yeah, a funny monkey.

17:15.959 --> 17:17.542
But your movies also had you.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.125
A man that lived by the Wasabi code.

17:21.709 --> 17:24.083
That's the code
sensei Rudy still lives by.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.625
We swear by
the light of the dragon's eye...

17:33.959 --> 17:35.792
To be loyal, honest

17:37.083 --> 17:38.417
and never say die.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.667
Wasabi.

17:43.417 --> 17:44.542
Bobby, look,

17:45.125 --> 17:46.458
Rudy's far from perfect,

17:47.583 --> 17:49.417
But he's more than just a great sensei.

17:51.542 --> 17:52.709
He's our friend.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.750
Do the right thing. Give him his job back.

18:19.542 --> 18:20.834
Okay, who was that guy?

18:22.250 --> 18:23.458
I have no idea.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.333
I'm just glad that you could see him too.

"Bobby Wasabi vs. Piranhapus!"

20:05.792 --> 20:07.041
- Take 1.
-

20:09.166 --> 20:10.959
And action!

20:12.000 --> 20:13.750
Somebody help me, please.

20:13.834 --> 20:15.333
It's horrible.

20:15.417 --> 20:17.917
This thing's out of control.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.792
It's over, Piranhapus!

20:37.709 --> 20:39.709
-
Argh!

20:41.709 --> 20:43.417
You framed me for murder.

20:43.959 --> 20:45.458
You stole my girl.

20:45.542 --> 20:49.083
And you crushed the dreams
of a beautiful young porpoise.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.583
Cut!

20:54.834 --> 20:57.709
Bobby, baby, bubbie.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.250
You're killin' me. Where's the energy?

21:01.333 --> 21:03.000
You're right. I phoned that one in.

21:04.834 --> 21:08.500
Eddie, go in there and tell Jerry
to take it easy with that fake tentacle.

21:08.583 --> 21:09.834
He's going way too big.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.667
Hey guys. Sorry I'm late.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.458
They wouldn't let me
on the bus with this thing.

21:15.125 --> 21:16.417
Wait a minute.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.458
If you're here with this, then what was--
