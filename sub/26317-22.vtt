been trying to keep him all the way out.

00:03.852 --> 00:05.439
But I'm here. I ain't there.

00:05.463 --> 00:06.574
DAVIS: Picked up Darryl at a house party.

00:06.598 --> 00:08.276
But he blew zero on the breathalyzer.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.578
As a courtesy,
I'm releasing him into your custody.

00:10.602 --> 00:11.913

00:11.937 --> 00:13.364
The boy was shot.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.116
They took Darryl to surgery already.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.369
Now, reading is hard.

00:17.393 --> 00:19.098
- Did Kelly do something wrong again?
- No.

00:19.122 --> 00:21.589
I-I think she might have dyslexia.

00:21.613 --> 00:23.457
You still helping her
with her reading, the dyslexia?

00:23.481 --> 00:25.192

00:25.216 --> 00:26.877

00:26.902 --> 00:28.213
a new charter school this year.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.048
I'm in a financial hole. Deep.

00:36.278 --> 00:37.589
a mutual moment that we had.

00:37.613 --> 00:38.757
Was I wrong?

00:38.781 --> 00:40.425

I'm Sergeant Daniel Harrelson, SWAT.

Yeah, Billings, Southwest.

01:35.170 --> 01:36.785
Are you running point on
the Darryl Henderson case?

01:36.809 --> 01:39.249
- Yep.
- Do you know what went down yet?

01:39.641 --> 01:41.653
No, I'm still trying
to piece it together.

01:41.677 --> 01:44.322
Best guess is, the kid took
a job delivering snack foods,

01:44.346 --> 01:45.824
saw how much cash was involved,
roped one of his friends

01:45.848 --> 01:47.325
into robbing the truck.

01:47.349 --> 01:49.494
Probably a disagreement over the split.

01:49.518 --> 01:50.962
Friend pulls a piece,
you can fill in the rest.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.630
Wait a minute. You think
Darryl was involved

01:52.654 --> 01:53.818

Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.763
My pleasure. What couldn't wait?

02:17.788 --> 02:19.580
Right down to business. I love it.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.745
For the last three months,
the FBI has been tracking

02:23.769 --> 02:26.164
a ring of sex traffickers
operating out of Jalisco.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.199
They have moved hundreds
of women and children

02:28.223 --> 02:31.035
over the Arizona-Mexico border,
and that number is set to grow.

02:31.059 --> 02:33.588
- How does that involve the LAPD?
- Next month, the ring's leader,

02:33.612 --> 02:35.874
Rodrigo Navarro, will be
setting foot on U.S. soil

02:35.898 --> 02:37.709
for the first time in three years.

02:37.733 --> 02:40.428
Now he's looking for someone to
coordinate his entry stateside,

02:40.452 --> 02:43.047
and we had an agent ready to go
undercover as his coordinator.

02:43.071 --> 02:45.216
But a recent data breach in
the Phoenix field office

02:45.240 --> 02:46.851
has us worried she'll be made.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.134
You're not looking
for SWAT's help are you?

02:48.158 --> 02:49.747
No. Because of the data breach,

02:49.771 --> 02:52.440
we need someone outside of
the Bureau to step in for her.

02:53.181 --> 02:54.466
We want you.

02:54.491 --> 02:56.675
Your work in Mexico was imprssive.

02:56.699 --> 02:58.730
And it had to feel a little satisfying.

02:59.121 --> 03:00.865
- How long are we talking?
- Two weeks

you out for a month?

03:03.926 --> 03:05.236
You haven't run this by him yet?

03:05.260 --> 03:07.739
- No point if you're not on board.
- I don't know.

03:07.763 --> 03:09.240
Uh, Mexico City was a few days.

03:09.264 --> 03:11.910
But a month? I have commitments to SWAT.

03:11.934 --> 03:13.795
- To the LAPD.
- I understand that it is

03:13.819 --> 03:15.964
short notice, but you have
an opportunity here

03:15.988 --> 03:17.515
to save hundreds of women and children.

03:17.539 --> 03:19.918

03:23.111 --> 03:24.756
And I'm not knocking that.

03:24.780 --> 03:26.925
I'm just saying that it would be
a damn shame to keep someone

03:26.949 --> 03:28.760
with your instincts stuck behind a desk.

03:28.784 --> 03:30.478
Promise me you'll read the case file

03:30.868 --> 03:32.117
before saying no?

03:33.839 --> 03:35.934
- I'll take a look.
- That's all I ask.

03:37.022 --> 03:38.114
Thank you.

03:52.140 --> 03:53.618
I take it you already heard.

03:53.642 --> 03:56.511
Heard enough but not
everything. How bad is he?

03:57.145 --> 03:59.290
He got one in the chest, one in the leg.

03:59.314 --> 04:00.959
He was in surgery all yesterday.

04:00.983 --> 04:02.427
Right now he's in the ICU.

04:03.101 --> 04:05.797
Had to hear my son got shot thirdhand.

04:05.821 --> 04:09.133
Didn't even get the
courtesy of a phone call.

04:09.157 --> 04:11.269
I felt like it was best
to come tell you in person,

04:11.293 --> 04:12.986
so I got down here as soon as I could.

04:14.329 --> 04:15.773
Know who shot him yet?

04:16.490 --> 04:17.824
No.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.144
You? Anything on your end?

04:20.168 --> 04:22.780

with the Hammers or you?

04:22.804 --> 04:24.616
That it would've spilled
over onto Darryl?

04:24.640 --> 04:26.284
You serious right now?

04:26.308 --> 04:28.820
You took my son out of juvie
without telling me.

04:28.844 --> 04:30.655
You took him in without telling me.

04:30.679 --> 04:32.323
You really think I wouldn't
find out my son

04:32.347 --> 04:33.625
was living with a cop?

04:33.649 --> 04:35.159
I wasn't trying to hide it, Leroy.

04:35.183 --> 04:37.045
Man, you should've left him
in juvie where I could

04:37.069 --> 04:39.330
- look out for him.
- He almost died in juvie!

04:39.354 --> 04:40.960
What, you think this
"assert your dominance" crap

04:40.984 --> 04:42.683
- was gonna help keep him alive?
- It's kept me alive.

04:42.707 --> 04:44.219
He ain't you, Leroy, you know that!

04:44.243 --> 04:47.005
No, but he's my son. Not yours.

04:47.029 --> 04:48.673
Ain't nobody disputing that.

04:48.697 --> 04:50.558
But if you want the truth,
you ain't been there for him.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.310
- I ain't had much choice.
- Oh, stop it!

04:52.334 --> 04:54.178
You had a choice. We both did.

04:54.202 --> 04:55.680
Oh, you come here to mix it up with me?

04:55.704 --> 04:57.024
No, I came here to keep the peace.

04:57.048 --> 04:58.399
- How's that?
- Leroy,

04:58.423 --> 05:00.018
if you ain't done it already,

05:00.042 --> 05:02.020
as soon as I walk out that door,
you're gonna call O-Dog

05:02.044 --> 05:03.855
or one of your Gs you used
to roll with because

05:03.879 --> 05:05.323
you want retribution for your son.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.525
You know you do. And I'm asking you

05:07.549 --> 05:10.161
- to stand down. Let me handle it.
- I let this go

05:10.185 --> 05:12.914
without consequence, pretty soon
I'll be staring down

05:12.938 --> 05:14.165

05:14.189 --> 05:16.334

Nah, I got to make my move.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.336
No, you don't. Not this time, man.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.005
Hey, the world don't start
spinning the other way around

05:21.029 --> 05:22.674
just 'cause you say so!

05:22.698 --> 05:24.509
Leroy, I'm gonna find out
who did this to Darryl.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.927
I give you my word.

05:27.602 --> 05:29.319
I don't know what that means no more.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.575
You do you. I do me.

05:44.586 --> 05:46.197
HICKS: No.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.950
It's a conflict of interest,
you being involved in the case.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.702
Sir, the detective's already
made up his mind,

05:50.726 --> 05:52.286
and thinks Darryl was involved.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.738
Well, I'm sure the facts will shake out.

05:53.762 --> 05:54.956
Give it a day or two.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.290
Take the time. Go be with the kid.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.709
I'm not doing him any good

05:57.733 --> 05:59.877
sitting in the hospital waiting
while whoever did this

05:59.901 --> 06:01.245
is getting away with it.

06:01.269 --> 06:03.837
Darryl's father, Leroy,
you know he ain't playing.

06:03.861 --> 06:05.249
He's already got guys on the street

06:05.273 --> 06:06.417
searching for the shooter.

06:06.441 --> 06:08.052
And they ain't waiting on warrants.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.235
They gonna be breaking down
doors and knocking heads,

06:10.259 --> 06:12.805
and when they find him,
they're gonna kill him.

06:12.829 --> 06:14.931
Along with any chance I got
at clearing Darryl's name.

06:14.955 --> 06:16.427
Hondo, we're SWAT!

06:16.451 --> 06:18.596
We don't run robbery investigations.

06:18.620 --> 06:19.764
That's not what we do.

06:19.788 --> 06:21.432
I'm looking into this one way
or the other.

06:21.456 --> 06:23.398
So we can either make this official,

06:23.422 --> 06:25.937

informed of all your movements.

- Who was that?
- That was Brad.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.512
He used to work here,
but we had to let him go

07:41.536 --> 07:43.231
because he verbally abused a customer.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.849

Everything's still good to go

for her discipline record,

- No way.

guaranteed her seat in the fall.

09:48.323 --> 09:50.668
it's up to the principal,
and the principal is concerned

09:50.692 --> 09:52.837
- about her conduct.
- Yeah, but Kelly's been working so hard.

09:52.861 --> 09:54.171
She's so excited.

09:54.195 --> 09:55.339
I don't know how I'm gonna tell her.

09:55.363 --> 09:56.891
No, look, look, no, no.

09:56.915 --> 09:58.676
No, we are not gonna
take no for an answer.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.394
Okay? Don't worry. I got this.

10:00.418 --> 10:02.800
- Luca, you have done more than enough.
- If Kelly stays

10:02.824 --> 10:05.094
at her current school, she's
just gonna keep falling behind,

10:05.118 --> 10:07.595
no matter how many of these
sessions we do each week.

10:07.619 --> 10:09.180
She deserves better.

10:09.205 --> 10:10.654
(PHONE BEEPING)

10:10.678 --> 10:13.190
Look, I got to run.
But I'm gonna make a few calls.

10:13.214 --> 10:14.408
I'll see what I can do.

10:14.432 --> 10:16.664
I'm gonna fix this, okay?

10:16.688 --> 10:17.924
Hey, you just keep
working hard, all right?

10:17.948 --> 10:20.019
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:22.023 --> 10:24.168
DEACON: Patrol sent over an
ID of our shooting suspect.

10:24.192 --> 10:26.081
Brad Thomas. He's got one prior.

10:26.081 --> 10:27.509
Threatened someone over a parking spot.

10:27.533 --> 10:28.677
Social media shows that

10:28.701 --> 10:30.011
he's a champion competitive shooter.

10:30.035 --> 10:31.513
He's got two guns registered to his name,

10:31.537 --> 10:33.682
a Glock 17 and a Remington 700.

10:33.706 --> 10:35.809
He was fired from his job
at the diner two days ago.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.240
Whatever happened to
dealing with rejection

10:37.264 --> 10:38.853
- like a normal human being?
- TAN: Yeah, right?

10:38.877 --> 10:40.355
Sinking a few beers, bitching to friends,

10:40.379 --> 10:41.856
wake up next day with a hangover,

10:41.880 --> 10:43.191
hit the Help Wanted sections.

10:43.215 --> 10:44.448
LUCA: Street, why are you so quiet?

10:44.472 --> 10:46.213
This got anything to do with
you not coming home last night?

10:46.237 --> 10:47.495
TAN: Really? Somebody
finally swiped right,

10:47.519 --> 10:49.821
- give you a pity date?
- No, I...

10:49.845 --> 10:51.416
DEACON: Listen up. Patrol
just completed a grid search

10:51.440 --> 10:53.168
the restaurant. No sign
of Brad, he's in the wind.

10:53.192 --> 10:54.536
But his pay slips show that he's living

10:54.560 --> 10:55.704
in a boarding house in Santa Monica.

10:55.728 --> 10:57.372
- So Luca, let's head there.
- Yep.

10:57.396 --> 10:59.396
Treating him as an active shooter.

11:11.961 --> 11:13.577
Tan.

11:17.082 --> 11:18.777
- Right side clear!
- Left side clear!

11:19.404 --> 11:20.528
Clear.

11:20.552 --> 11:22.197
- CHRIS: He's not here.
- DEACON: 30-David to Command.

11:22.221 --> 11:23.804
No sign of Brad Thomas.

11:25.557 --> 11:28.119
- Does he have a family?
- A wife, Lara Thomas.

11:28.143 --> 11:29.738
We're working on bringing her in.

11:29.762 --> 11:31.740
And a daughter, Thea Thomas.

11:31.764 --> 11:33.625
Three years old...

11:33.649 --> 11:35.577
Oh, wait.

11:35.601 --> 11:37.078
His daughter died.

11:37.102 --> 11:38.463
Nine months ago.

11:38.487 --> 11:39.772
(EXHALES) Well,
that could be one trigger.

11:39.796 --> 11:41.249
Empty ammo boxes here.

11:41.273 --> 11:42.801
Got to be at least 200 rounds' worth.

11:42.825 --> 11:44.719
With that much ammo, he's got
to be planning something big.

11:44.743 --> 11:46.087
Before he turns the gun on himself.

11:46.111 --> 11:48.590
This guy laid out a funeral suit.

11:48.614 --> 11:49.997
He's not planning to live through this.

11:53.321 --> 11:56.097
You said Brad killed two people?

11:56.121 --> 11:57.649
Yes, he did.

11:57.673 --> 12:00.268
We want to make sure that number
doesn't get higher.

12:00.578 --> 12:02.638
You think he might want
to hurt more people?

12:02.663 --> 12:05.208
We don't know. That's why we need
to ask you some questions, Lara.

12:06.011 --> 12:07.322
Witnesses said your husband was

12:07.347 --> 12:08.875
driving your car. Do you have any idea

12:08.900 --> 12:10.611
where he was headed,
what he was planning?

12:10.636 --> 12:12.247
No.

12:12.271 --> 12:14.449
- No, I haven't seen him for weeks.
- Why not?

12:14.473 --> 12:16.026
I've been in rehab.

12:16.050 --> 12:18.453
The Mercer Center? It's a 60-day program,

12:18.477 --> 12:20.338
so they made, uh,
an exception for me to get out

12:20.362 --> 12:22.457
- and come here.
- They don't allow visitors?

12:22.481 --> 12:24.175
Uh...

12:24.199 --> 12:25.960
mm...

12:25.984 --> 12:27.796
uh, Brad and I were getting a d-divorce.

12:27.820 --> 12:29.953
Is it because of what happened
to your daughter?

12:31.359 --> 12:32.684
Yeah, that morning,

12:32.708 --> 12:34.469
she, uh, she was fine.

12:34.946 --> 12:37.639
She, she woke up smiling, like always.

12:37.663 --> 12:39.993
We went and played at the park and, uh...

12:41.467 --> 12:43.083
by the afternoon, she was gone.

12:45.170 --> 12:47.315
It was meningitis.

12:47.339 --> 12:48.817
Well,

12:48.841 --> 12:50.590
we're very sorry for your loss.

12:52.531 --> 12:53.917
Yesterday was her birthday.

12:54.670 --> 12:57.034
She, uh, she would have been four.

12:59.017 --> 13:01.713
Lara, did Brad hold any grudges?

13:01.737 --> 13:03.832
Was he angry with anyone specifically?

13:03.856 --> 13:06.384
I-I don't know. Oh...

13:06.408 --> 13:07.991
the world?

13:10.028 --> 13:11.806
Do you have any idea what it's, uh,

13:11.830 --> 13:13.413
like to lose a child?

13:15.250 --> 13:18.573
Well, they say most marriages
don't survive it.

13:19.490 --> 13:22.183
But, uh... I don't know
how most people do.

13:22.207 --> 13:24.235
(SNIFFLES) You know, I started, uh,

13:24.259 --> 13:27.489
drinking, other stuff,
too, but I'm-I'm clean.

13:27.513 --> 13:30.418
36... 36 days.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.195
But, uh, Brad, he took
so much time off of work

13:34.219 --> 13:35.697
to-to help me out, though, you know,

13:35.721 --> 13:38.083
he got, he got fired. And he was a chef.

13:38.107 --> 13:40.869
At a nice restaurant.

13:41.512 --> 13:43.056
Downtown.

13:43.729 --> 13:46.508
Can you just imagine going
from that... to a diner?

13:46.532 --> 13:48.343
And of course, without his paychecks,

13:48.367 --> 13:50.095
we couldn't keep up with the mortgage.

13:50.119 --> 13:52.714
So the bank took the house
and I didn't care,

13:52.738 --> 13:53.983
but, um...

13:55.073 --> 13:56.611
but Brad did.

13:57.709 --> 14:01.211
He said it was where
all his memories were of Thea.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.194
We're gonna, um...

14:06.218 --> 14:08.029
need the name
of that restaurant downtown,

14:08.053 --> 14:10.231
the bank that foreclosed on the house

14:10.255 --> 14:12.734
and the hospital
where Thea was taken and...

14:12.758 --> 14:14.569
any other potential targets. (EXHALES)

14:14.593 --> 14:15.820
All right?

14:15.844 --> 14:17.666
We'll have one of our officers
help you out.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.800
Yep.

14:22.985 --> 14:24.913
So, Street, if you weren't
on a date last night,

14:24.937 --> 14:26.414
where were you?

14:26.438 --> 14:28.389
- I...
- JESSICA: Tan. I need you to help out

14:28.413 --> 14:29.999
the shooter's wife, Lara Thomas.

14:30.023 --> 14:31.586
- She's in my office.
- Yeah, on it.

14:32.396 --> 14:34.756
Actually, I, uh, been staying

14:34.780 --> 14:36.141
at my mom's apartment
the last few nights,

14:36.165 --> 14:37.725
hoping she'll show up.

14:37.749 --> 14:39.238
Nothing yet.

14:39.262 --> 14:41.095
Good luck with that.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.003
Hey.

14:46.258 --> 14:47.411
When are we...

14:48.343 --> 14:49.771
I mean, when are we gonna talk about

14:49.795 --> 14:51.656
all this... awkwardness between us?

14:51.680 --> 14:54.548
We're not. We're just...
gonna do our jobs.

15:12.367 --> 15:13.733
Detective.

15:14.719 --> 15:16.269
Sergeant.

15:18.123 --> 15:19.517
I already spent the entire day
here yesterday.

15:19.541 --> 15:21.636
I wasn't planning on another.

15:21.660 --> 15:22.804
I wish you had told me this morning

15:22.828 --> 15:24.138
you had a personal stake in the case.

15:24.162 --> 15:25.690
Is the kid friend or family?

15:25.714 --> 15:27.275
A little of both.

15:27.299 --> 15:29.527
Right. This is the delivery driver.

15:29.551 --> 15:31.279
Jorge Romero.

15:31.303 --> 15:32.790
He'll run you through what he saw.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.450
Mr. Romero.

15:35.474 --> 15:37.118
I'm Sergeant Daniel Harrelson, LAPD SWAT.

15:37.142 --> 15:38.486
Hondo, right? Yeah...

15:38.510 --> 15:40.321
Darryl never shuts up about you.

15:40.715 --> 15:43.157
- How's he doing?
- Not great.

15:43.181 --> 15:44.492
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:44.516 --> 15:45.543
Look, I know you've already told

15:45.567 --> 15:46.961
Detective Billings what happened,

15:46.985 --> 15:48.796
but I'd appreciate it
if you'd run through it for me.

15:48.820 --> 15:50.465
Yeah, u-um...

15:50.489 --> 15:52.000
Darryl and me had
already unloaded the boxes.

15:52.024 --> 15:53.334
I was inside

15:53.358 --> 15:54.802
working out payment with the owner,

15:55.062 --> 15:56.337
when Darryl rushed out.

15:56.361 --> 15:57.839
30 seconds later, I hear this...

15:57.863 --> 15:59.025
"pop pop."

15:59.704 --> 16:02.420
I came out, saw Darryl lying right there.

16:02.534 --> 16:04.062
Did you see the shooter's face?

16:04.086 --> 16:05.480
Clothes, tats, anything?

16:05.504 --> 16:07.232
Um, by the time I got
out here, guy was gone.

16:07.256 --> 16:08.850
So was my cashbox.

16:08.874 --> 16:10.401
I don't know.

16:10.425 --> 16:11.986
I've hired a lot of troubled kids,

16:12.010 --> 16:13.214
you know, give them a second chance

16:13.238 --> 16:14.790
to start their life over and, uh...

16:16.048 --> 16:18.359
I never saw any of them
want it as bad as Darryl.

16:19.249 --> 16:20.319
Yeah.

16:20.343 --> 16:22.497
Look, if you remember anything at all,

16:22.521 --> 16:24.082
you call me directly

16:24.106 --> 16:25.700
at this number.

16:26.463 --> 16:27.796
Yeah.

16:36.902 --> 16:38.703
You already checked that camera?

16:38.727 --> 16:41.349
Yeah. Belongs to the restaurant
around the corner.

16:41.692 --> 16:43.217
Owner's out of the country,

16:43.241 --> 16:45.436
manager says he won't show us
anything without a subpoena.

16:45.460 --> 16:47.722
- You write one up?
- It's on the top of my to-do list.

16:47.746 --> 16:49.518
I'm assuming you checked
for prints, ran ballistics?

16:49.542 --> 16:50.861
Look, I know how to do my job.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.544
No prints, submitted
ballistics yesterday.

16:52.568 --> 16:54.395
All right, I've got a buddy
at FAU who owes me.

16:54.419 --> 16:55.697
- He'll put a rush on it.
- Can't wait.

16:55.721 --> 16:58.066
Hey. Why do I get the feeling

16:58.090 --> 16:59.489
that this case ain't
too priority for you?

16:59.513 --> 17:01.069
Because it's not.
I'm working five other cases

17:01.093 --> 17:02.620
right now, three of them homicides

17:02.644 --> 17:03.805
with innocent victims.

17:03.829 --> 17:05.175
Am I missing something here?

17:05.200 --> 17:07.009
Because Jorge didn't
mention a thing that points

17:07.032 --> 17:09.242
- a finger at Darryl.
- Is that your impartial opinion?

17:09.267 --> 17:10.912
Look, no offense, but this kid of yours

17:10.935 --> 17:13.047
got picked up with a bunch
of other bangers held at

17:13.070 --> 17:15.383
- the 77th a few weeks back.
- And he was released without charge.

17:15.406 --> 17:17.585
Into your custody. Come on, man.

17:17.608 --> 17:19.420
You're telling me you didn't
pull any strings there?

17:19.444 --> 17:21.472
Look, I get it. You two are close.

17:21.496 --> 17:23.558
If I'd known that this morning,
I would have held my tongue.

17:23.582 --> 17:24.925
But my theory still stands.

17:24.950 --> 17:26.761
Kid with his past, stack of stolen cash

17:26.785 --> 17:28.279
in his pocket doesn't scream, "Innocent."

17:28.304 --> 17:30.089
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
The cash was in his pocket?

17:30.113 --> 17:31.642
Most of it disappeared with the cash box,

17:31.666 --> 17:33.901
but yeah, Darryl had $500 in his pocket.

17:34.745 --> 17:36.604
- Did you ask Jorge about it?
- Yeah.

17:36.628 --> 17:38.239
He says Darryl has access to the cash

17:38.263 --> 17:39.774
he collected along the delivery route.

17:39.798 --> 17:42.276
Looks to me he grabbed
as much as he could

17:42.300 --> 17:44.088
before he got shot.

17:50.025 --> 17:51.502
Listen.

17:51.526 --> 17:53.254
I'm not rooting for this to turn out

17:53.278 --> 17:55.006
in any particular way...

17:55.030 --> 17:57.258
but sometimes the facts
are just the facts.

17:57.282 --> 17:59.187
You want to check my math?

17:59.211 --> 18:01.026
You be my guest.

18:01.050 --> 18:03.403
And if you find something,
you let me know.

18:07.993 --> 18:09.909
(ENGINE STARTS)

18:13.999 --> 18:16.027
(MOTOR IDLING)

18:16.051 --> 18:18.312
Come on, man, let's go. Hey!

18:18.336 --> 18:20.314
Hey!

18:20.338 --> 18:23.006
Did Leroy send you? Hey!

18:27.145 --> 18:29.490
LAPD. You all right?

18:29.514 --> 18:31.269
- (PANTING, GRUNTS)
- I got you.

18:31.293 --> 18:33.378
- (GRUNTS)
- You okay?

18:33.402 --> 18:35.163
Uh, been better.

18:35.187 --> 18:36.714
- What happened?
- Was getting ready to open,

18:36.738 --> 18:38.166
taking the trash out, when those guys

18:38.190 --> 18:39.834
come in, put a gun to my face

18:39.858 --> 18:41.636
and say to turn over the security footage

18:41.660 --> 18:42.961
from the camera outside.

18:42.985 --> 18:45.103
Took the whole DVR and
left. Of course, not before

18:45.127 --> 18:46.876
pistol-whipping me for no good reason.

18:46.901 --> 18:48.226
Here, let me help you.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.844
Did you see the footage from yesterday?

18:49.868 --> 18:51.614
- Nope.
- Any chance there's a backup?

18:52.537 --> 18:54.015
Uh, might be.

18:54.039 --> 18:56.017
Boss would know, but he decided to take

18:56.041 --> 18:58.186
his little slam piece to
Punta Mita for the week.

18:58.210 --> 19:00.354
Left me alone to deal with this crap.

19:01.499 --> 19:02.523
Oh, come on.

19:03.334 --> 19:04.692
Every damn day.

19:04.716 --> 19:06.661
Homeless guy comes 'round
the block every morning

19:06.685 --> 19:08.329
dumpster diving for recyclables.

19:08.353 --> 19:10.415
Leaves a mess that I got to clean up.

19:10.439 --> 19:13.343
Was he in the area yesterday morning?

19:13.368 --> 19:15.554
Like I said, every damn day.

19:16.394 --> 19:18.206
- What's he look like?
- Red beanie,

19:18.230 --> 19:20.508
pushes a shopping cart. Name's Disco.

19:21.058 --> 19:22.307
Disco?

19:23.902 --> 19:26.047
Man, Mr. Kim don't pay me
nearly enough for this.

19:26.071 --> 19:28.049
HICKS: How are we doing
with the shooter's wife?

19:28.073 --> 19:30.218
Tan's still working with Lara on a list

19:30.242 --> 19:31.683
of her husband's potential targets.

19:31.707 --> 19:33.888
- But I was hoping you had a minute.
- What's up?

19:33.912 --> 19:35.890
Agent Benson came to see me this morning.

19:35.914 --> 19:37.461
Says she needs me for another
undercover assignment.

19:37.486 --> 19:38.980
- How long?
- One month.

19:39.005 --> 19:40.194
Is there an LA connection?

19:40.218 --> 19:42.530
- No, not really.
- Well, let her down easy.

19:42.554 --> 19:44.532
There's no need
straining that relationship.

19:44.556 --> 19:47.034
Well, a-actually, I'm considering it.

19:47.058 --> 19:49.120
She's trying to poach you, Cortez.

19:49.144 --> 19:51.789
I mean, come on.
It's not a one-month gig.

19:51.813 --> 19:54.075
One month turns into two,
just long enough

19:54.099 --> 19:56.577
for you to fall in love with
the job and decide to stay on.

19:56.601 --> 19:58.746
I know this play;
hell, I've made this play myself

19:58.770 --> 20:00.671
to grab personnel from other departments.

20:00.695 --> 20:03.251
Even if it were a play,
I wouldn't let it happen.

20:03.275 --> 20:06.387
I'm happy here.
This would only be one month.

20:06.411 --> 20:07.673
You're on a short list for

20:07.697 --> 20:10.003
Director of Police Operations.
You want jeopardize that?

20:10.027 --> 20:11.726
No reason I can't do both.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.095
During the Mexico City operation,

20:14.119 --> 20:16.063
being in the field again,

20:16.087 --> 20:17.815
all the responsibility on my shoulders,

20:17.839 --> 20:19.706
I-I felt useful.

20:21.793 --> 20:24.460
It was different. Exciting.

20:26.598 --> 20:27.942
It's your career.

20:27.966 --> 20:29.443
You really want me to sign off

20:29.467 --> 20:31.717
on this, I'll do it.
But you keep in mind:

20:31.741 --> 20:33.664
when they do interview you
for Police Ops,

20:33.688 --> 20:35.283
they're gonna want someone who's

20:35.307 --> 20:36.424
happily married to the LAPD,

20:36.448 --> 20:39.453
not someone with a mistress at the FBI.

20:39.477 --> 20:42.290
You take this gig, you can kiss
Police Ops good-bye.

Well, it's a little bit of both.

23:23.691 --> 23:25.202
Airships couldn't get there in time

23:25.226 --> 23:27.004
because of the proximity to the airport.

23:27.028 --> 23:29.923
He must've slipped through
our perimeter in all the chaos.

He hijacked a woman's red Honda CR-V

23:32.033 --> 23:33.544

He still has his Glock, though.

Brad might go after.

where their daughter was taken,

23:41.042 --> 23:43.020
and the restaurant downtown
where he used to work.

people who left bad reviews

social media for any clues

23:48.916 --> 23:51.228
to locations or people
we might have missed.

23:51.252 --> 23:52.613
We found this in the minivan.

23:52.637 --> 23:54.198
It's a invoice for a towing company.

23:54.222 --> 23:55.566
Explains why he took Lara's car.

23:55.590 --> 23:56.734
His got towed last night.

23:56.758 --> 23:58.402
Could be another possible target.

23:58.426 --> 24:00.070
What about the wife?

24:00.094 --> 24:02.239
You think she could be a target
because of the divorce?

24:02.263 --> 24:04.241
JESSICA: Possibly.
We wanted her to stay here,

24:04.265 --> 24:06.243
but her rehab center wanted her back.

24:06.267 --> 24:08.462
Felt she needed supervision
given what's happened.

24:08.486 --> 24:10.464
We sent a uni with her just in case.

Six months ago, this guy
had everything to live for.

has everything to die for.

company. Take Luca and Tan.

Not sure. Maybe you have something

into a delivery truck.

I figure he's robbing it, but
not my cart, so not my problem.

- Did you get a look at the guy?
- Nuh-uh.

25:15.887 --> 25:17.648

the other kid comes out,

25:17.672 --> 25:18.982

stick around after that.

He recently started jabbing
needles in his arm.

29:57.468 --> 29:59.830
Right now he'd sell his
own mother for a hit.

when we make deliveries.

I guess he thought he could make
a quick buck robbing his uncle.

planned this thing together?

I mean, my old man didn't even think

38:27.986 --> 38:29.415
I was gonna amount to anything,

38:29.978 --> 38:32.373
but when I was 14, I had a teacher,

38:32.398 --> 38:34.159
his name was Mr. Clark,

38:34.184 --> 38:37.163
he's the first person to ever
tell me that I was smart

38:37.188 --> 38:40.167
and that I just saw things
a little differently.

38:40.192 --> 38:41.887
And he took me to see a therapist

38:41.912 --> 38:44.173
who diagnosed me with dyslexia.

38:44.198 --> 38:46.343
So they helped work me
to learn how to read.

38:46.368 --> 38:48.346
And after that, I-I stopped
getting in fights

38:48.371 --> 38:49.815
and I turned my grades around.

38:49.840 --> 38:52.063
And now I'm-I'm a SWAT officer.

38:52.847 --> 38:55.149
You know, so I must've been
worth something,

38:55.964 --> 38:59.766
and it was all because someone
gave me a second chance.

39:00.852 --> 39:03.781
I've known Kelly for a year.

39:03.805 --> 39:05.419
And you're not gonna read it in her file,

39:05.443 --> 39:08.467
but she is kind and she's hardworking

39:08.491 --> 39:09.776
and smart.

39:11.863 --> 39:15.398
She just needs somebody
to give her a second chance.

39:18.486 --> 39:21.154
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

39:26.878 --> 39:29.523
- You start this fall.
- No way!

39:29.547 --> 39:31.859
Yes way! (CHUCKLES)

39:31.883 --> 39:33.945
Yeah!

39:33.969 --> 39:35.421
Does this mean no more tutoring sessions?

39:35.445 --> 39:37.507
Not a chance, kiddo. You can't
get rid of me that easy.

39:37.531 --> 39:40.127
- Good.
- Yeah? Good job.

39:40.855 --> 39:42.466
Thank you.

39:42.491 --> 39:43.773
Yeah.

39:52.015 --> 39:54.048
You said one month.

39:54.072 --> 39:55.499
This is two,

39:55.523 --> 39:57.134
- maybe three months' work.
- If I'd told you that

39:57.158 --> 39:59.003
from the get-go,
you'd never have read the file.

39:59.027 --> 40:00.655
Are you trying to poach me from SWAT?

40:00.679 --> 40:02.195
Look, Navarro's a bad guy.

40:02.219 --> 40:04.308
All right? The priority
is taking him down,

40:04.332 --> 40:06.403
but if, at the end of the operation,

40:06.427 --> 40:09.555
you felt like staying on, well,
there would definitely be

40:09.579 --> 40:11.409
- a place for you.
- I have a place here on SWAT.

40:11.433 --> 40:13.415
I can't just leave for three months.

40:13.439 --> 40:14.719
Plus, I'm looking at a promotion.

40:14.743 --> 40:16.187
It sounds great.

40:16.211 --> 40:17.844
I assume it's more time behind a desk?

40:19.228 --> 40:22.574
Cortez, you are too good
to be sitting on the sidelines.

40:22.599 --> 40:24.566
You need to be out in the field.

40:29.941 --> 40:31.891
(THUMPING NEARBY)

40:38.860 --> 40:40.743
LAPD! Hands where I can see them!

40:42.757 --> 40:44.120
Mom?

40:45.140 --> 40:46.802
Mom?

40:47.742 --> 40:49.337
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

40:49.361 --> 40:50.673
This is my apartment
you're breaking into,

40:50.697 --> 40:52.134
and that is my Blu-ray player

40:52.158 --> 40:53.352
you're trying to steal. Bad move.

40:53.376 --> 40:55.102
I wasn't breaking in. I got keys.

40:55.967 --> 40:58.508
And I wasn't stealing, neither.
This is mine.

40:58.532 --> 41:00.448
- Where'd you get the keys?
- Karen told me this was her place.

41:00.472 --> 41:02.305
She said I could come by
and take whatever I wanted.

41:04.122 --> 41:05.349
Is she okay?

41:05.374 --> 41:06.540
Karen? How should I know?

41:07.812 --> 41:09.907
How much does she owe you?

41:09.931 --> 41:12.104
$200. You gonna pay me?

41:12.128 --> 41:14.567
Pay you? You're-you're lucky
I don't arrest you.

41:16.332 --> 41:17.708
Let me see this.

41:18.697 --> 41:21.490
Frezno Tina? You're the one who
sold my credit card information.

41:21.515 --> 41:23.920
She give you that, too? Where is she?

41:23.945 --> 41:25.328
Where is my mom?

41:26.448 --> 41:28.281
How much is it worth?

41:32.388 --> 41:34.199
This Blu-ray player you want so bad.

41:35.268 --> 41:36.456
Okay.

41:38.380 --> 41:40.358
I'll tell you where she is,
but I'll warn you,

41:40.383 --> 41:42.233
you might not like what you find.

41:45.934 --> 41:47.800
(MONITOR BEEPING RHYTHMICALLY)

41:49.804 --> 41:51.615
WOMAN (OVER P.A.): Charge
nurse on duty to NICU.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.451
Charge nurse on duty to NICU.

41:53.475 --> 41:55.441
(GROANING SOFTLY)

41:58.159 --> 41:59.275
Darryl?

42:01.549 --> 42:03.465
Hey, Darryl.

42:05.153 --> 42:06.757
Don't worry, D.

42:07.322 --> 42:09.133
Things will be okay.

42:09.157 --> 42:12.208
- I promise.
- (MUFFLED): Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
