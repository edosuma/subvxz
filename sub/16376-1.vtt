03:14.821 --> 03:16.325
Life...

03:16.425 --> 03:20.257
...is mankind's most precious resource.

03:20.357 --> 03:24.577
It's the one thing that every
living creature on this earth...

03:24.677 --> 03:26.925
...wants more than anything else.

03:27.025 --> 03:30.935
Now, the primary purpose
of medical science...

03:31.035 --> 03:36.040
...has always been to heal, to extend life.

03:36.140 --> 03:39.977
But what about improving...

03:40.077 --> 03:42.080
...the life we have?

03:42.180 --> 03:46.620
Shouldn't that receive
just as much attention and effort?

03:49.020 --> 03:53.628
We are stimulus response
creatures at our core.

03:53.730 --> 03:56.828
We do something that makes us feel good...

03:56.928 --> 03:58.683
...we want to do it again.

03:58.963 --> 04:03.369
We do something that makes us
feel bad and we want to avoid it.

04:03.969 --> 04:05.132
But...

04:05.232 --> 04:09.585
...when the memory of these feelings fade...

04:09.685 --> 04:11.710
...especially the good ones...

04:12.510 --> 04:16.781
...we have to seek out
this stimulus all over again.

04:17.081 --> 04:21.754
Like some drug addict
looking for another fix.

04:22.854 --> 04:25.420
But what if we could change all that?

04:25.520 --> 04:29.961
What if you could not only remember...

04:30.061 --> 04:32.564
...the first time you fell in love...

04:32.664 --> 04:35.333
...but re-experience it...

04:35.433 --> 04:38.203
...in full sensory detail.

04:38.303 --> 04:42.373
As if it was happening all over again.

04:52.550 --> 04:54.953
A9913.

04:55.653 --> 04:57.905
A revolutionary new...

04:58.005 --> 05:01.458
...memory enhancement formula
from Hallorann Pharmaceuticals...

05:01.558 --> 05:06.031
...is about to make that dream a reality.

05:06.731 --> 05:10.425
Memory increases of up to 300%...

05:10.525 --> 05:15.717
...have been recorded in 85%
of all test subjects.

05:15.817 --> 05:18.887
And not mere static memory, no.

05:19.177 --> 05:22.380
Full memory recall.

05:22.950 --> 05:26.972
Sight, smell, taste, touch, sound.

05:27.452 --> 05:31.152
With A9913, we can relive...

05:31.252 --> 05:35.814
...our finest moments any time we want.

05:36.394 --> 05:37.952
It's...

05:38.052 --> 05:42.072
...instant access to unlimited joy.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.664
Now...

05:44.764 --> 05:48.213
...how's that for improving life?

06:03.553 --> 06:07.191
Dr. Jerum, thank you for coming.

06:07.291 --> 06:11.702
- Did you enjoy the presentation?
- It was entertaining.

06:13.464 --> 06:15.300
Walk with me.

06:15.900 --> 06:19.316
I understand your position, doctor,
that as a man of science...

06:19.416 --> 06:23.708
...you prefer to focus on the details of
your work rather than the big picture.

06:23.808 --> 06:26.711
But where is Dr. Rasmussen by the way?

06:26.811 --> 06:28.747
I asked him to be here as well.

06:29.547 --> 06:32.751
We aren't... social.

06:33.251 --> 06:35.845
You are one of the most brilliant
researchers in your field...

06:35.945 --> 06:40.502
...and the progress you've made
on A9913 is nothing short of miraculous.

06:40.602 --> 06:44.645
But the board doesn't understand
the ebb and flow of scientific discovery.

06:44.745 --> 06:46.865
They require results.

06:46.965 --> 06:50.805
Well, testing on the new compound
has been quite promising.

06:50.905 --> 06:54.322
Hypothalamus stimulation
has been greatly improved.

06:54.472 --> 06:57.391
Mortality rates stabilized and...

06:57.491 --> 07:01.596
...side effects have been reduced
to a reasonable level.

07:01.696 --> 07:07.762
None of which will matter to the FDA unless
they're supported by more human trials.

07:13.957 --> 07:16.428
The results from this weekend's study...

07:17.078 --> 07:19.545
...will be ready to submit to the FDA.

07:21.215 --> 07:24.454
Good. Don't let me down, doctor.

07:28.473 --> 07:31.743
In fact, don't let humanity down.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.342
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.694
- How ya been?
- All right.

08:06.794 --> 08:08.713
Coming to beg Tom for your job back?

08:08.813 --> 08:11.282
Didn't you hear? I won the lottery!

08:11.382 --> 08:14.318
Yeah, I bought this place.
You work for me now.

08:14.418 --> 08:16.484
Well, then I need a raise ASAP.

08:16.584 --> 08:19.258
Not after I caught you giving away free beer.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.961
All right, boss lady.

08:23.361 --> 08:25.798
Tell me what my next customer's gonna order.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.117
PiÃ±a colada.

08:29.567 --> 08:34.256
- All right.
- Hi, can I get like a piÃ±a colada?

08:36.539 --> 08:38.616
Sorry, we don't have a blender.

08:39.076 --> 08:41.613
- Maybe a daiquiri?
- Still no blender.

08:41.712 --> 08:45.188
But why don't you go down there and
check out our specialty. Let me know.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.128
How 'bout this guy?

08:52.929 --> 08:55.724
Manhattan and a fake ID.

08:58.129 --> 08:59.597
Excuse me.

08:59.697 --> 09:02.166
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

09:02.266 --> 09:04.202
Do you have a Manhattan?

09:04.302 --> 09:06.788
- A Manhattan?
- Yeah.

09:09.607 --> 09:12.009
Do you have a real ID I can see?

09:21.684 --> 09:24.790
- At least you still haven't lost your touch.
- I have a gift.

09:25.890 --> 09:28.235
Only if it would help me get another job.

09:30.995 --> 09:32.816
How about this guy?

09:35.900 --> 09:37.769
Mind erasers.

09:38.269 --> 09:42.343
Hey, man, that girl's pretty wasted.
Can you call her a cab?

09:43.357 --> 09:45.209
Yeah, what's her name?

09:45.309 --> 09:47.239
I didn't ask, I'll go check.

09:50.681 --> 09:52.984
- What was that?
- What?

09:53.084 --> 09:54.887
That cute little look.

09:56.287 --> 09:59.457
No, I... look, I came here to ask
if you know of anyone hiring.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.593
Do you have an idea or not?

10:02.003 --> 10:03.837
Actually, yeah.

10:05.997 --> 10:07.799
There's this.

10:08.359 --> 10:11.235
Buddy of mine's done it a couple
of times. Says it's easy money.

10:11.335 --> 10:14.138
Unless you really wanna beg
for your job back.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.474
I'd rather sell my body to science.

10:57.851 --> 11:00.318
Let's begin, shall we?

11:00.718 --> 11:02.720
My name is Dr. Jerums.

11:02.820 --> 11:05.858
I'm the lead researcher for your study.

11:07.258 --> 11:09.260
Thank you for making
the long drive this morning.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.481
I'm sure it's rather early for most of you.

11:12.581 --> 11:15.499
There are some formalities we must attend to.

11:15.599 --> 11:20.790
You're welcome to read along
or just... just listen.

12:02.796 --> 12:05.285
Hey, I'm here for the study.

12:08.386 --> 12:11.588
You have agreed to participate
in a phase three clinical drug trial...

12:11.688 --> 12:16.294
...of A9913 olympic simulator
designed to enhance memory.

12:16.794 --> 12:19.063
As this is a blinded trial...

12:30.240 --> 12:33.377
...50% of the subjects
will receive the test serum.

12:33.477 --> 12:36.313
The remaining 50% will receive a placebo.

12:36.413 --> 12:38.883
During the study you will be confined
to the upstairs dorms...

12:38.983 --> 12:42.803
...where you will be continuously
monitored by the Hallorann staff.

12:42.903 --> 12:49.309
It is imperative that every volunteer
reports any atypical sensation experienced.

12:49.409 --> 12:54.662
However, volunteers shall not discuss
these sensations with other volunteers.

12:55.032 --> 12:58.261
Now, if you'll please pass forward your
signed non-disclosure agreements...

12:58.361 --> 13:01.539
...along with any keys,
cellphones, or other devices.

13:01.639 --> 13:03.893
Why do you need our cellphones?

13:05.643 --> 13:08.279
This is a very confidential study. Miss?

13:08.379 --> 13:11.106
- Nichols.
- Miss Nichols...

13:11.206 --> 13:13.818
...communication is tightly regulated.

13:14.518 --> 13:15.953
And our keys?

13:16.053 --> 13:20.571
Leaving the facility before the completion
of this study is strictly forbidden.

13:20.891 --> 13:25.830
We can't have you go out on any... joyride.

13:28.616 --> 13:30.384
Thank you for your participation.

13:30.484 --> 13:33.187
The study tech Curtis
will take you to the dorms.

13:33.287 --> 13:35.139
The campus is spread over 20 acres...

13:35.239 --> 13:38.709
...and provides research facilities
for over 1,800 employees.

13:38.809 --> 13:41.779
At any given time there might be
10 to 15 studies going on.

13:41.879 --> 13:45.616
Then, why do you guys only
let me come in once a month?

13:45.716 --> 13:49.920
But, due to the upcoming holiday,
we are running on a skeleton crew.

13:50.020 --> 13:53.441
So please, don't make my life difficult.

13:54.992 --> 13:58.796
We're also one of the only privately owned
biosafety level four facilities in the country.

13:58.896 --> 14:01.599
Which means there are thousands of drugs,
and chemicals, and pathogens here...

14:01.699 --> 14:05.135
...that can literally kill you.
So don't wander off.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.039
Right this way.

14:15.679 --> 14:17.815
Hey, two to six.

14:17.915 --> 14:19.784
Thank you, sir.

14:24.250 --> 14:27.958
No buttons. I guess they
really don't want us to leave.

14:28.058 --> 14:29.860
Who'd wanna leave?

14:32.730 --> 14:35.736
Go ahead and find your bags and follow me.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.784
Right this way, come on in.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.253
Come on in, guys, don't be shy.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.383
Claimed.

15:02.259 --> 15:03.929
All right...

15:04.029 --> 15:06.937
...you have your common room here up front.
Your bunkrooms are in the back.

15:07.037 --> 15:10.100
Girls, you're straight ahead.
Guys, you're down the hall to the left.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.603
Get comfortable,
go ahead and store your things.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.634
We'll begin calling your names
for dosing in about an hour.

15:26.916 --> 15:29.420
Hey, so do you go to state?

15:29.720 --> 15:33.307
- Yeah.
- My name's Kristen, with a K.

15:33.407 --> 15:35.326
What sorority are you in? Beta?

15:35.426 --> 15:37.028
- No, I'm not in a sorority.
- Kapa.

15:37.128 --> 15:40.831
I knew it, you look like a Kapa girl.
They're always really pretty.

15:40.931 --> 15:42.767
And kinda smart.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.638
Men and Yola?

15:47.538 --> 15:50.574
God, I never thought I'd do
one of these in a million years.

15:50.674 --> 15:53.744
But Daddy cut my Christmas budget in half so.

15:53.844 --> 15:55.680
Can you believe that?

15:56.380 --> 15:58.416
- He likes you.
- What?

15:58.516 --> 16:01.018
Chayendy Rock, I caught him checking you out.

16:01.118 --> 16:03.454
What if we were doing
one of those 30 day trials.

16:03.554 --> 16:06.290
I bet everybody will be hooking up.
It's like summer camp.

16:06.390 --> 16:10.494
- Yeah, summer camp with drugs.
- I don't do drugs.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.429
Where do you think we are exactly?

16:12.529 --> 16:15.299
These are prescription drugs,
there's a difference.

16:15.399 --> 16:18.102
- They've been tested.
- Yeah, tested on us.

16:18.202 --> 16:21.271
This ain't exactly your mother's
medicine cabinet.

16:21.371 --> 16:24.074
Hibbard and Ruskin.

16:24.174 --> 16:28.747
- Whatever, it's my time to dose.
- Whatever, enjoy your drugs.

16:30.247 --> 16:31.503
Newbies.

16:33.717 --> 16:35.945
So how many of these have you done?

16:36.753 --> 16:39.356
Let's see, one, two, three...

16:39.456 --> 16:43.861
...carry the four,
divide it by seven... a lot.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.531
Yeah, but at the end of those pharmaceutical
commercials there's always this long list...

16:47.631 --> 16:50.467
...of disclaimers, should I be worried?

16:50.567 --> 16:53.683
Look, this is the best gig in town.
We get free food...

16:53.783 --> 16:57.174
...you can play pool, video games, you can
even read a book if you're into that stuff.

16:57.274 --> 16:59.610
We basically get paid to do nothing.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.912
Seems like you have it all figured out.

17:02.312 --> 17:05.767
Yes, I... do.

17:06.215 --> 17:08.405
All while being absolutely colorblind.

17:47.623 --> 17:49.144
Sir.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.396
Still no word from Dr. Rasmussen.

17:52.896 --> 17:54.932
Do you want me to keep trying him?

17:59.803 --> 18:02.086
No, but let me know when he calls.

18:04.575 --> 18:07.024
Here, you watch them for a while.

18:35.344 --> 18:38.409
So am I supposed to believe
this a coincidence?

18:38.509 --> 18:41.062
I don't know. Would you believe that?

18:42.212 --> 18:44.557
Look, the bartender gave me a flyer too.

18:47.684 --> 18:51.718
Look, I'm not like a stalker, okay?
I'm just broke.

18:52.523 --> 18:55.573
I guess I'm not the only
college student who needs money.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.296
- Den Fergusen.
- Den?

18:59.396 --> 19:03.401
Yeah, like a comfy room.
Or a shelter for woodland animals.

19:04.651 --> 19:08.690
Guess my parents wanted to make life
just slightly more awkward for me.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.208
Anna.

19:11.308 --> 19:13.195
Nice to stalk you, Anna.

19:14.678 --> 19:16.266
Miss.

19:23.887 --> 19:27.888
- What is this supposed to do again?
- It's a hippocampus stimulator.

19:31.061 --> 19:35.734
- What does that mean, though?
- It stimulates the hippocampus.

19:38.035 --> 19:40.604
It works on a part of your brain
that's associated with memory.

19:40.704 --> 19:44.364
The hope is it may help cure Alzheimer's.
Among other things.

19:53.850 --> 19:56.787
Wait... what if someone walks out?

19:56.887 --> 20:00.357
Well, you're welcome to leave of course.
But the time to make that decision is now.

20:00.457 --> 20:04.127
Once you've received the injection you have
to stay on site 'til the end of the study.

20:04.227 --> 20:06.063
No exceptions.

20:06.763 --> 20:08.532
For your own safety of course.

20:08.632 --> 20:11.836
And how long will it take
'til I start to feel something?

20:12.536 --> 20:14.771
Absorption rates differ
according to a range of variables.

20:14.871 --> 20:18.075
Tissue density, metabolic rates,
cellular efficiency.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.409
It varies per test subject.

20:21.962 --> 20:23.804
How long will it last?

20:25.816 --> 20:28.819
Again, miss, that depends
on the individual's physiology.

20:28.919 --> 20:31.822
The variables I just mentioned
and a host of other factors.

20:31.922 --> 20:34.759
On average, six to eight hours.

20:35.459 --> 20:37.828
If you don't want to, don't.

20:37.928 --> 20:40.931
Don't forget, there's a 50% chance
you'll get the placebo.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.471
And exhibit no effects whatsoever.

21:23.872 --> 21:28.080
Look at that, perfectly lined up. Gonna
have to put you out of your misery, man.

21:35.655 --> 21:37.269
Okay.

21:37.521 --> 21:39.323
Who's next?

21:39.423 --> 21:42.593
Come on, I'll put up 60,
the challenger only loses 20.

21:42.693 --> 21:45.996
Hey, if you're such the pool shark
then why do a research study?

21:46.096 --> 21:50.500
Well, I heard I could meet desperate
hotties who can pass an STD test.

21:52.069 --> 21:56.206
- It's a joke, I'm joking.
- Well, my dad says nobody really jokes.

21:56.306 --> 21:59.544
A person's joke actually tells you
exactly what they're thinking.

22:00.744 --> 22:04.982
Let me paint a picture for you.
I'm in a hold 'em game, tuition stakes.

22:05.082 --> 22:09.086
I go all in with a jack high because I know
the other guy only has queen high.

22:09.186 --> 22:12.689
- A queen's better.
- Yeah, it is, very good.

22:12.789 --> 22:18.017
But you don't call a $2,500 bet
when you only have a queen, okay.

22:18.117 --> 22:20.430
- Nobody does that.
- But he did.

22:20.530 --> 22:24.156
Yeah, he did. So, here I am.

22:25.836 --> 22:28.272
All right, come on, who's next?

22:28.972 --> 22:32.180
Somebody. All right, how about...

22:34.066 --> 22:35.746
...you?

22:35.846 --> 22:38.081
Yeah, you want a shot at the champ?

22:38.381 --> 22:40.954
- I don't play.
- Yup, she doesn't play.

22:41.054 --> 22:44.354
I can teach you.
Come on, just in here it'll be fine.

22:44.454 --> 22:47.525
I could break that cue across your face.
That would be fun.

22:48.375 --> 22:51.495
Yeah, yeah. But then you'd have to kiss it.

22:51.595 --> 22:54.432
- Make it a little better.
- I'll play you.

22:55.432 --> 22:58.836
- What, you wanna kiss me too?
- I like her idea better.

22:59.736 --> 23:01.672
All right, big boy, I'll play ya.

23:01.772 --> 23:05.181
Bet you're pretty good too. You wouldn't
risk losing in front of the girls.

23:08.445 --> 23:10.213
I guess we'll see.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.881
That's good, that's good.

24:00.629 --> 24:03.667
Don't cry, everybody,
it's gonna be over soon.

24:11.632 --> 24:13.512
Come on!

24:15.662 --> 24:18.428
What, okay, yeah, I messed up.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.654
How did you do that?

24:24.754 --> 24:27.124
- Do what?
- How did you put the balls back?

24:27.224 --> 24:29.994
He missed, it's your turn.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.367
You didn't just see me shoot?

24:37.067 --> 24:41.157
Okay, fine. Whatever, man, your loss.

24:53.255 --> 24:55.111
Doctor wants to see you.

24:55.969 --> 24:57.507
Yeah.

25:13.118 --> 25:14.979
How do you feel?

25:16.072 --> 25:19.242
Fine. Maybe a little strange I guess.

25:19.342 --> 25:22.012
He's so cocky and braggadocios.

25:22.112 --> 25:26.095
And like, he thinks he's so cute
because of his tiny t-shirt...

25:26.195 --> 25:28.418
...and his spiky hair, and his muscly arms.

25:28.518 --> 25:30.687
And he flirts with all the girls
and like, they believe it.

25:30.787 --> 25:32.599
And he's not a good pool player.

25:33.890 --> 25:36.296
It's like he had a mental breakdown.

25:39.296 --> 25:41.118
Are you okay?

25:43.133 --> 25:45.020
I don't feel so well.

25:52.976 --> 25:54.837
Is everything okay?

26:10.094 --> 26:11.295
Do you mind?

26:11.395 --> 26:14.064
He's so cocky and braggadocios...

26:14.164 --> 26:17.801
...and like he thinks he's so cute
because of his tiny t-shirt...

26:17.901 --> 26:20.070
...and his spiky hair, and his muscly arms.

26:20.170 --> 26:22.405
And he flirts with all the girls
and like, they believe it.

26:22.505 --> 26:24.375
And he's not a good pool player.

26:25.575 --> 26:27.995
It's like he had a mental breakdown.

26:31.147 --> 26:32.996
Are you okay?

26:36.019 --> 26:37.875
I don't feel so well.

26:42.759 --> 26:44.594
Is everything okay?

27:09.451 --> 27:11.307
Do you mind?

27:12.322 --> 27:15.994
I missed a shot. And it was exactly like...

27:17.394 --> 27:19.562
...I don't know,
like I saw it happen I guess.

27:19.662 --> 27:22.859
Please be specific.
Did you see it happen or did you...

27:22.959 --> 27:27.237
...experience it in full sensory detail.
Sight, smell, taste.

27:27.337 --> 27:31.166
Yeah. It was like it really happened, twice.

27:39.349 --> 27:42.986
We have been testing this drug
for almost three years.

27:43.486 --> 27:45.522
It's a very refined version.

27:45.922 --> 27:48.802
Any side effects should be minimal.

27:49.192 --> 27:52.062
Would you say you are predisposed
to this sort of thing?

27:52.162 --> 27:54.595
To what? Seeing the future?

27:56.433 --> 27:57.901
More like intuition.

27:58.001 --> 28:01.404
Well, I'm a hell of a card player.
But of course that comes from counting cards.

28:01.504 --> 28:03.473
So would you say you have
an above average memory?

28:03.573 --> 28:06.603
Sure. But I'm above average in most things.

28:09.179 --> 28:13.056
Okay. I'm gonna send you back
but with one condition.

28:13.156 --> 28:16.305
I don't want you to discuss this
with anyone. And these studies...

28:16.405 --> 28:19.810
Yeah, I get it. One person gets a headache,
everybody thinks they got a headache.

28:19.910 --> 28:22.861
- Exactly.
- But this was no headache.

28:25.061 --> 28:27.527
Once we had a drug study volunteer...

28:27.627 --> 28:30.967
...who was suddenly hit with
the worst back pain you could imagine.

28:31.067 --> 28:33.636
He was in agony, couldn't even stand up.

28:33.736 --> 28:35.605
You know what he took?

28:36.005 --> 28:40.310
Nothing, placebo. Physically he was fine.

28:40.410 --> 28:43.813
There is no sensation, sight, smell, taste...

28:43.913 --> 28:46.759
...that the mind cannot experience as real.

28:51.287 --> 28:53.807
Remember, keep it to yourself.

29:18.547 --> 29:21.151
It's getting worse out here, be careful.

29:21.251 --> 29:23.053
Thanks, Allen, I'll try.

29:23.153 --> 29:26.790
All right, and if you have any trouble
just call me, I'll come running.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.093
You better come running with some snow shoes.

29:29.193 --> 29:31.494
Whatever it takes, darling.

29:31.594 --> 29:33.430
Drive safe.

29:41.103 --> 29:43.339
And then it happened again.

29:43.439 --> 29:47.610
Right after I left the doctor's office
I came out here with all of you.

29:47.710 --> 29:49.605
Except, I guess I didn't...

29:49.705 --> 29:54.184
...because I was just like that
right back in the doctor's office again.

29:54.284 --> 29:55.418
Like deja vu?

29:55.518 --> 29:58.822
No, no, it's like it happens once...

29:58.922 --> 30:02.592
...and then it happens again,
the exact same way.

30:02.692 --> 30:04.127
It's so weird.

30:04.227 --> 30:07.864
First trippy drug study I've been
a part of and I get the placebo.

30:07.964 --> 30:10.900
It's not fun, okay, it's scary.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.038
Like even now, in this conversation,
is this really happening...

30:15.138 --> 30:18.875
...or am I just about to jump back
to the beginning again?

30:18.975 --> 30:21.782
It's like I don't know when now is.

30:23.012 --> 30:25.082
None of you are feeling anything?

30:29.452 --> 30:32.809
- Lights out in five.
- Could you just give us a little longer?

30:32.909 --> 30:35.992
I don't make the rules. Lights out in five.

30:36.392 --> 30:38.465
You're not even my real dad!

30:42.165 --> 30:46.636
You know, this drug is supposed
to help increase our memory.

30:46.736 --> 30:48.972
What if you're just remembering the future?

30:49.072 --> 30:52.685
- Remembering the future.
- On a quantum level, time is not linear.

30:52.785 --> 30:55.409
Our brain's just perceive it that way
so that we can differentiate...

30:55.509 --> 30:58.248
...between past, present, and future.

31:00.016 --> 31:03.052
- I watch a lot of Dr. Who.
- Look, I don't care what it is.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.550
I just want it to stop, now!

31:06.122 --> 31:08.158
Marcus, tell them!

31:08.958 --> 31:10.860
I'm okay.

31:10.960 --> 31:15.048
- That's not what you said earlier.
- Well, that's what I'm saying now.

31:18.067 --> 31:20.303
That wasn't five minutes, Curtis!

31:20.403 --> 31:22.272
Go to sleep!

31:30.746 --> 31:33.183
All I know, is I didn't sign up for this.

31:33.283 --> 31:37.036
I'm getting out of here first thing in the
morning before they can give us anything else.

32:41.117 --> 32:43.153
- Jerums.
- <i>Dr. Jerums.</i>

32:43.253 --> 32:45.671
<i>How are things progressing?</i>

32:45.771 --> 32:47.651
Fine, good.

32:47.991 --> 32:50.760
<i>Busy. Dr. Rasmussen never showed.</i>

32:50.860 --> 32:53.263
Well, actually, that's why I'm calling.

32:53.663 --> 32:58.477
I'm afraid that Dr. Rasmussen was found
dead outside of his home this morning.

33:00.837 --> 33:03.186
- Do you know what happened?
- <i>Not really, no...</i>

33:03.286 --> 33:06.076
<i>...but the police are
treating it as a homicide.</i>

33:06.176 --> 33:11.005
They found some odd details at the scene.

33:11.105 --> 33:13.850
Some sketches.

33:14.150 --> 33:16.152
Does that mean anything to you?

33:16.252 --> 33:17.787
Sketches.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.164
<i>Dr. Jerums?</i>

33:30.733 --> 33:32.771
<i>Dr. Jerums, are you there?</i>

33:39.007 --> 33:41.079
Dr. Jerums, are you there?

33:48.350 --> 33:49.959
Strange.

33:51.721 --> 33:55.126
Change of plans.
Take me to the research facility.

35:34.756 --> 35:37.160
Open the door please! Come on!

35:43.950 --> 35:45.819
Come on!

35:46.469 --> 35:48.957
Come on, come on!

35:49.572 --> 35:52.341
Come on! Come on!

36:42.909 --> 36:44.541
Hello!

36:58.824 --> 37:00.359
Hey!

37:05.997 --> 37:08.634
Hey, hey! Stop that!

37:08.734 --> 37:10.303
- I saw them dying!
- Who?

37:10.403 --> 37:13.707
- Her, all of them, everyone!
- Come with me, we'll talk to Dr. Jerum.

37:13.807 --> 37:16.944
- No way, I am done, I'm leaving!
- I can't let you do that!

37:17.044 --> 37:20.112
- Stop, you're just making it worse!
- What are you doing?

37:20.212 --> 37:22.082
They are all going to die!
Are you listening to me?

37:22.182 --> 37:25.785
Something is going to happen in that bunk
and they are going to die! Let me go!

37:25.885 --> 37:28.120
- Let her go!
- Look, step back, all right.

37:28.220 --> 37:29.488
You can't just keep her here.

37:29.588 --> 37:31.524
I don't want to hurt you,
but there's a blizzard out there.

37:31.624 --> 37:34.794
If she's exhibiting side effects then she
needs to be here where we can help her.

37:34.894 --> 37:36.695
You understand?

37:39.232 --> 37:41.107
I'm gonna take her to see the doctor.

37:41.767 --> 37:43.788
I'll keep you informed, okay?

38:40.125 --> 38:41.994
- What happened?
- Just acting crazy.

38:42.094 --> 38:44.630
- Said she saw them dead.
- Saw who dead?

38:44.730 --> 38:46.902
I don't know, all of them.

38:47.002 --> 38:49.502
I had to sedate her to calm her down.

38:49.602 --> 38:51.496
Let's leave that for now.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.929
Is it happening again?

38:59.612 --> 39:03.649
I'll take it from here.
Just keep an eye on the others.

39:03.749 --> 39:05.281
Right.

39:09.589 --> 39:13.325
Please, let me go.

39:16.479 --> 39:21.913
You are experiencing a very rare
but very powerful side effect.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.772
Tell me what you saw.

39:26.272 --> 39:28.108
They were screaming.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.222
And gagging.

39:33.412 --> 39:35.429
I saw them dead on the floor.

39:40.119 --> 39:44.954
I'm sorry to say things are about
to get much worse for you.

39:48.050 --> 39:49.703
Please.

39:52.398 --> 39:54.434
We'll talk more when you feel better.

40:29.051 --> 40:30.943
Hal, that you?

40:34.373 --> 40:35.943
Hal.

42:09.887 --> 42:12.905
I'm leaving. You wanna come?

42:13.005 --> 42:15.070
Come on, get your things.

42:21.546 --> 42:23.415
Where are you two going?

42:23.947 --> 42:27.066
Well, if we're lucky we can
make it to the casino by morning.

42:27.386 --> 42:29.655
You're leaving to go gamble?

42:29.755 --> 42:32.491
We can see the future. What do you think?

42:32.591 --> 42:36.315
Look, I don't care where we're going,
as long as it's not here. You should come.

42:36.415 --> 42:38.457
Well, how do we get down?
The doors are locked.

42:38.557 --> 42:41.767
I saw the Scratch guy go through there.
It's gotta go somewhere.

42:41.867 --> 42:43.720
Are you coming or not?

42:45.638 --> 42:47.640
Yeah, let's go.

42:49.334 --> 42:51.079
We're not splitting the money with that guy.

42:51.179 --> 42:53.404
Wait, we're really going to a casino?

44:12.992 --> 44:14.561
Man.

44:24.469 --> 44:27.690
- Wait, do you know where we are?
- Sixth floor.

44:27.790 --> 44:30.230
Yeah, but do you know how to get down?

44:36.048 --> 44:39.685
Wait, wait, what just happened?
Why did all the doors unlock?

44:39.785 --> 44:43.555
Because my luck is on fire right now.
Let's go before they switch back.

44:43.655 --> 44:45.192
Okay.

44:46.692 --> 44:48.728
Hey, the exit's this way!

44:49.851 --> 44:52.695
You're kidding me, that's why you came?

44:52.795 --> 44:55.567
Den, there are a million doors
in this place, man.

44:55.667 --> 44:57.670
You're never gonna find her.
And if you do, what then?

44:57.770 --> 44:59.854
Marcus, let's just go please.

45:12.384 --> 45:15.220
What are you doing?
This is where we just came from.

45:20.659 --> 45:22.691
Behind the looking glass.

45:51.190 --> 45:55.662
- Snap, we're busted.
- No, no, he can't see us.

45:58.931 --> 46:00.599
Hello?

46:02.367 --> 46:05.070
Would you stop it? Show him your boobs.

46:05.170 --> 46:07.897
- No.
- He can't see, go, do it.

46:07.997 --> 46:10.479
Do you take anything seriously?

46:16.380 --> 46:18.250
You guys...

46:18.350 --> 46:21.175
...they've been watching us the whole time.

46:23.722 --> 46:25.391
We should go.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.697
Yeah, that's what I've been saying.

47:03.095 --> 47:05.458
- Come on!
- Come on, come on, come on!

47:05.558 --> 47:08.167
Don't let go! Come on!

47:08.867 --> 47:10.437
Hurry!

47:12.137 --> 47:14.028
Come on!

47:20.762 --> 47:22.984
Gotta go, go, go, go!

47:33.858 --> 47:37.098
- Oh, my...
- Go, go, go, go, go!

47:46.504 --> 47:48.393
Hey, this way!

47:59.952 --> 48:02.154
- What are you guys doing?
- We're going this way!

48:02.254 --> 48:04.090
It's freezing!

50:16.754 --> 50:18.972
For your own safety of course.

50:57.746 --> 51:00.582
Heat, heat, heat, turn on the heat!

51:01.132 --> 51:03.769
- It'll take a second.
- Was it you, you little punk?

51:03.869 --> 51:06.508
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, let him go!

51:09.908 --> 51:12.111
Did you see someone? Anyone?

51:12.211 --> 51:16.331
I saw you guys running like hell and next
thing I know I'm in a blizzard in my PJ's!

51:16.431 --> 51:19.378
Obviously I should have
just minded my own business.

51:19.918 --> 51:22.988
Somebody murdered that nurse guy.

51:23.088 --> 51:25.925
Curtis? He's dead?

51:26.525 --> 51:28.593
Damn, I actually liked that guy.

51:28.693 --> 51:30.763
We didn't see who did it.

51:31.063 --> 51:34.333
Look, I'm not used to being the least
medicated guy in a group situation.

51:34.433 --> 51:37.035
Are you sure it just wasn't one
of your little visions?

51:37.135 --> 51:39.221
This really happened!

51:39.972 --> 51:42.904
Besides, we took that drug
like hours ago anyway.

51:43.004 --> 51:44.844
And I didn't take it at all.

51:45.744 --> 51:48.781
If you weren't leaving,
why were you downstairs?

51:49.981 --> 51:53.956
- Just looking around, you know, whatever.
- Come on, he's lying!

51:54.986 --> 51:57.857
- Okay.
- Scratch, it's okay. He's fine, all right!

51:57.957 --> 52:01.794
Can we stop talking about this
so that we can get the hell out of here?

52:02.594 --> 52:04.162
We can't leave.

52:04.262 --> 52:06.665
I swear to God I'm gonna
punch you in the face!

52:06.765 --> 52:09.217
We can't leave everybody up there
not knowing what's going on!

52:09.317 --> 52:12.287
- But we don't know what's going on!
- Can't leave everyone or just one girl?

52:12.387 --> 52:15.607
- Everybody includes Anna.
- I'm not going back.

52:15.707 --> 52:18.377
Let's just call the cops
when we make it to town.

52:18.477 --> 52:21.572
No, in this weather that could take hours.
If we could make it at all.

52:23.515 --> 52:25.650
Hey, what are you doing?

52:25.750 --> 52:28.286
Those flashes you saw,
you really think they were real?

52:28.386 --> 52:31.415
Do you really saw events
before they happened?

52:34.159 --> 52:37.195
What if Anna's right too?
What if they're all gonna die?

52:37.295 --> 52:39.598
How are we supposed to do
anything about that?

52:39.698 --> 52:41.933
Even Curtis couldn't do anything.

52:44.009 --> 52:46.304
They are asleep, man.

52:46.404 --> 52:50.175
If there is even a chance,
we can't just let them die.

52:50.275 --> 52:53.078
- I mean, what if it was us?
- But it's not us!

52:53.178 --> 52:56.618
We're out here, so we have to go!

53:03.288 --> 53:04.966
I can take it from here.

53:20.137 --> 53:23.475
- How 'bout you, you wanna come?
- Yeah, I'm more of a stand back...

53:23.575 --> 53:26.678
...and make witty observations
kind of guy, so.

53:26.778 --> 53:30.649
All right, well, you know this place.
Any idea where they might have taken Anna?

53:30.749 --> 53:33.674
Probably the hospital ward.
Just make a right on the fifth floor.

53:33.774 --> 53:35.970
Wait, can you like...

53:36.370 --> 53:40.009
...leave the keys just so
we could keep the heater on?

53:42.127 --> 53:45.802
This won't take long. And you are a coward.

53:54.238 --> 53:56.341
Son of a bitch.

53:56.441 --> 53:58.701
Marcus, what are you doing?

54:07.084 --> 54:09.087
We should probably share body heat.

54:09.487 --> 54:11.727
We need to take off all our clothes.

54:13.592 --> 54:15.823
Marcus, wait up!

54:22.394 --> 54:23.977
Hey!

54:26.254 --> 54:28.120
Well, we tried, man.

54:48.929 --> 54:50.825
We have to go upstairs.

54:59.838 --> 55:01.673
What is that smell?

56:01.366 --> 56:04.936
- Bleach, ammonia.
- Yeah, cleaning supplies.

56:05.036 --> 56:08.940
No, nobody cleans with both.
Not if they wanna keep breathing.

56:09.040 --> 56:13.046
- Basically makes mustard gas.
- Whatever, we going up or what?

56:14.646 --> 56:16.937
Freight elevator, yeah, that'll work.

56:53.050 --> 56:56.855
I'm gonna go find Anna.
You wake the others when we...

57:03.361 --> 57:05.718
- Be safe.
- Yeah, no shit.

58:13.070 --> 58:15.100
Please, please.

58:42.160 --> 58:45.596
Come on! Come on!

58:49.702 --> 58:51.103
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

58:51.203 --> 58:53.071
- They are dying, goddamn you!
- No, it's too late!

58:53.171 --> 58:55.787
It's mustard gas, they're gone.

59:02.180 --> 59:04.616
- What happened?
- Somebody...

59:05.316 --> 59:07.519
They're all gone, the guys too.

59:16.360 --> 59:18.640
Anna, are you okay?

59:19.764 --> 59:24.155
They are dead, it came true!
It is all going to come true!

59:26.004 --> 59:27.806
I think we need to go. Right now, okay?

59:27.906 --> 59:30.375
No, wait, what do you mean
it's all... it all came true.

59:30.475 --> 59:32.877
- It doesn't matter, we have to go.
- It does matter.

59:32.977 --> 59:35.849
She saw them die like that and it happened.

59:38.199 --> 59:40.258
What else have you seen?

59:43.972 --> 59:45.773
Where's Kristen?

01:01:16.547 --> 01:01:19.753
- That was her! Where is she?
- This way!

01:01:21.653 --> 01:01:23.190
Kristen!

01:01:24.159 --> 01:01:25.994
Oh, my God!

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.862
- We gotta find out where this ends.
- Come on!

01:02:18.008 --> 01:02:19.538
There!

01:02:23.197 --> 01:02:24.742
Kristen!

01:02:29.687 --> 01:02:31.223
Jesus.

01:02:32.423 --> 01:02:34.259
Is she still up there?

01:02:37.428 --> 01:02:39.567
Where is she, what did he do with her?

01:02:39.897 --> 01:02:41.528
- Who?
- You tell me...

01:02:41.628 --> 01:02:44.469
...you're the one
with all the messed up visions!

01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:47.805
We saw someone kill Curtis.
And we found a guard's body.

01:02:47.905 --> 01:02:50.441
It has to be the same one
who killed the others.

01:02:50.541 --> 01:02:54.429
- And you had visions too.
- Yeah, of a freaking pool shot, man!

01:02:54.529 --> 01:02:57.199
Not dead bodies and this!

01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:00.251
Did you see this or not?

01:03:00.351 --> 01:03:03.354
No, I thought I saw her on the tile,
but I never saw her face.

01:03:03.454 --> 01:03:06.059
- I mean, maybe this isn't her.
- Guys.

01:03:08.009 --> 01:03:10.011
It was a trap, he knew she'd be here.

01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:12.330
No, that's impossible. How can someone know?

01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:14.832
Someone who's taken the drug would know.

01:03:14.932 --> 01:03:18.836
- Who, Scratch?
- No, no, he got the placebo like me.

01:03:18.936 --> 01:03:21.738
Yeah, well, everyone else is dead, man!

01:03:23.241 --> 01:03:25.309
But this isn't the first time
this drug has been tested.

01:03:25.409 --> 01:03:27.790
It could have been someone
from a previous study.

01:03:33.366 --> 01:03:35.236
What else did you see?

01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:40.225
Guys.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.326
We gotta go!

01:04:00.611 --> 01:04:03.965
Who locks an emergency exit?
I didn't even know you could do that!

01:04:04.065 --> 01:04:06.317
- We need to find another way out.
- You think?

01:04:06.417 --> 01:04:08.819
- Now!
- Let's try the lobby.

01:04:17.627 --> 01:04:19.030
Scratch!

01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:22.733
- Is he still there? Can you see him?
- Scratch!

01:04:32.008 --> 01:04:33.577
Scratch!

01:04:36.147 --> 01:04:39.383
Where are they? Warm thoughts,
okay, think warm thoughts.

01:04:39.483 --> 01:04:41.980
Beaches, soup.

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:45.079
That's right. I almost forgot.

01:04:45.723 --> 01:04:49.594
Let's see, we got some... some uppers.

01:04:49.694 --> 01:04:51.706
Some downers.

01:04:52.663 --> 01:04:54.165
Laxatives?

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.840
Some...

01:04:57.595 --> 01:04:59.833
...future seeing things.

01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:04.438
I'm gonna say... hallucinogens.

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:06.411
Yeah.

01:05:10.581 --> 01:05:13.461
Maybe we can open the doors
from there, come on.

01:05:20.757 --> 01:05:22.660
We need an access card.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.364
Great. I can't believe you
made us come back in here, man.

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:29.867
- Come back?
- Yeah, we were gone out the door.

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:33.037
But then Team Anna here
had to come back just for you.

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:37.508
- You came back for me?
- And the others. But, yeah.

01:05:37.608 --> 01:05:40.311
Yeah, so since you're
the only reason we're here...

01:05:40.411 --> 01:05:42.280
...what have you seen
that could help us get out?

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.750
- Nothing, it doesn't work like that.
- No, apparently it does work that way...

01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:49.420
...because this other nut job knows exactly
what we're gonna do before we do it!

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.123
Well, then why don't you go find him
and ask him because I don't know!

01:05:54.959 --> 01:05:56.714
What, was that him?

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:59.688
Maybe we can stay here and watch him coming?

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:02.867
He's killing the cameras.

01:06:03.367 --> 01:06:06.221
Yeah, of course he is
because he knew we'd be watching.

01:06:08.039 --> 01:06:11.542
We need to find the doctor.
Maybe he can get us out of here.

01:06:11.642 --> 01:06:14.078
Well, that's the point, man.
Where's he been through all this?

01:06:14.178 --> 01:06:16.213
Track that guy down.

01:06:18.015 --> 01:06:20.490
Here, Dr. Jerums, 237.

01:06:22.086 --> 01:06:23.696
Seriously?

01:06:25.389 --> 01:06:27.652
Look, it's better than waiting here to die.

01:06:30.261 --> 01:06:32.757
Fine, let's go.

01:06:41.972 --> 01:06:44.142
What's happening? Why aren't we moving?

01:06:44.242 --> 01:06:47.388
It's a storm, sir,
freeway's backed up for miles.

01:06:47.978 --> 01:06:49.574
Dammit.

01:06:53.785 --> 01:06:57.313
Come on, Jerums, pick up.

01:07:22.612 --> 01:07:28.092
Yes, this is Dr. Redmond Layton
from Hallorann Pharmaceuticals.

01:07:28.192 --> 01:07:31.121
I need you to send someone
to our research facility.

01:07:31.221 --> 01:07:34.060
It seems as if we've lost contact with them.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.829
Yes, I'm well aware of the storm.
In fact I'm stuck in it right now...

01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:40.932
...which is why I've called you.

01:07:41.332 --> 01:07:44.135
No, I'm not asking you to rescue me.

01:07:44.235 --> 01:07:48.139
I'm asking you to send someone because
I fear something may have happened...

01:07:48.239 --> 01:07:50.845
...to someone at my facility.

01:07:54.945 --> 01:07:57.958
Why am I saving humanity again?

01:08:04.722 --> 01:08:06.223
Okay.

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:55.755
Oh, thank God.

01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:22.198
Hell, yeah.

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:28.607
A key.

01:09:29.038 --> 01:09:30.888
Key, key.

01:09:48.374 --> 01:09:51.328
- Oh, he's not here, I'm shocked!
- Look for anything that might help.

01:09:51.428 --> 01:09:54.715
- Access cards, maybe our cellphones.
- Yeah, phone's dead.

01:09:54.815 --> 01:09:58.169
Are you sure because at some point
I think I remember a phone ringing.

01:09:58.269 --> 01:10:01.505
Well, if the phone rings we'll know
it's working again, won't we?

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.166
Guys.

01:10:07.945 --> 01:10:10.748
<i>This is Dr. Rasmussen, Dr. Jerums.</i>

01:10:10.848 --> 01:10:14.454
<i>Interview 21 patient eight, Paskell Dern.</i>

01:10:17.454 --> 01:10:20.357
<i>Tell us about another one of these
experiences you're having.</i>

01:10:20.457 --> 01:10:21.960
<i>Why?</i>

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.429
<i>Because it'll help us understand
what's happened to you.</i>

01:10:25.529 --> 01:10:28.198
- <i>Paskell...</i>
- <i>I'll tell you but it won't help.</i>

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:33.253
<i>You figure out the writing
on the bunkroom wall yet, Den?</i>

01:10:34.672 --> 01:10:38.127
<i>Okay, Den, what does Den mean?</i>

01:10:39.343 --> 01:10:42.678
<i>To go, Den, to go.</i>

01:10:44.748 --> 01:10:47.218
<i>I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.</i>

01:10:47.318 --> 01:10:49.187
<i>You will.</i>

01:10:58.361 --> 01:11:00.998
That file was created six months ago.

01:11:01.498 --> 01:11:03.968
No, I don't understand.
How is he talking to you?

01:11:04.068 --> 01:11:06.148
Because he saw it.

01:11:06.771 --> 01:11:09.790
He already knew that we'd
be here watching this video.

01:11:11.509 --> 01:11:13.911
Probably even a sketch of it somewhere.

01:11:14.411 --> 01:11:18.019
What was he saying? To go?
That doesn't make any sense.

01:11:20.017 --> 01:11:22.753
I need a wall. They weren't numbers.

01:11:22.853 --> 01:11:25.690
It wasn't 60, it was go.

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:28.681
What? 52, go?

01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:32.016
No, it's five.

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:37.334
You, Kristen, Scratch, Den, and me.

01:11:37.434 --> 01:11:39.283
Five to go.

01:11:49.879 --> 01:11:51.782
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:11:51.882 --> 01:11:55.213
- Scratch. Hang up, I need to call the cops.
- <i>I already tried that.</i>

01:11:55.313 --> 01:11:58.172
It's an inside line, I've been dialing
extensions looking for you guys.

01:11:58.272 --> 01:12:00.308
I'm with Marcus and Anna.

01:12:01.358 --> 01:12:02.993
All the others are dead.

01:12:03.093 --> 01:12:05.996
<i>Anna's vision came true. You understand?</i>

01:12:06.096 --> 01:12:08.466
Now all the doors are locked
and we can't get out.

01:12:08.566 --> 01:12:10.701
Okay, they're all dead?

01:12:10.801 --> 01:12:13.037
- Really?
- Where are you?

01:12:13.137 --> 01:12:15.039
<i>Some old garage.</i>

01:12:15.139 --> 01:12:18.302
<i>Hey, listen, I found a bunch of sketches.</i>

01:12:18.402 --> 01:12:21.812
They're actually pretty good. But it's weird
'cause one of them kinda looks like me.

01:12:21.912 --> 01:12:24.481
I mean, other than the eyes.
My eyes are pretty off.

01:12:24.581 --> 01:12:28.153
Yeah, we found some too. We think
the killer drew 'em, he was a patient.

01:12:28.253 --> 01:12:31.676
So a drug made him see us?

01:12:31.989 --> 01:12:34.056
Wow, that's...

01:12:34.256 --> 01:12:36.860
Hey, could you ask Anna
if she had any visions about me?

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.897
He wants to know if you've had
any visions about him.

01:12:39.997 --> 01:12:41.566
No.

01:12:42.366 --> 01:12:46.045
But you are telling me
that there is a crazy murderist...

01:12:46.145 --> 01:12:48.919
...somewhat decently talented artist
stalking this place?

01:12:49.019 --> 01:12:51.442
<i>Who knows exactly what we're
gonna do before we do it?</i>

01:12:51.542 --> 01:12:53.544
- Yup.
- Okay, good to know.

01:12:53.644 --> 01:12:56.006
Listen, Scratch, is there
any other way out of here?

01:12:56.106 --> 01:13:00.756
I don't know. But Curtis once threatened
to lock me in some biohazard clean room...

01:13:00.856 --> 01:13:03.416
...in the basement. Maybe you guys
could hide out there 'til morning.

01:13:03.516 --> 01:13:07.143
Okay, we'll check it out.
What are you gonna do?

01:13:09.126 --> 01:13:10.928
I'll think of something.

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:17.882
- I say we go to the shelter.
- No, forget it.

01:13:17.982 --> 01:13:21.472
Marcus, Marcus, it might be safer.

01:13:21.572 --> 01:13:23.108
What?

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:26.510
- What aren't you telling us?
- Back off.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:28.326
- What are you gonna do?
- Hey, quit it!

01:13:28.426 --> 01:13:30.811
- Come on, come on!
- Hey, hey, hey! Guys!

01:13:30.911 --> 01:13:33.347
Quit it, I saw something, okay?

01:13:35.502 --> 01:13:37.390
I saw a lot of things.

01:13:38.555 --> 01:13:40.357
Like what?

01:13:45.085 --> 01:13:47.900
Okay. Who gets it, him or me?

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.914
Tell us.

01:13:52.536 --> 01:13:54.398
We deserve to know.

01:13:56.273 --> 01:13:58.118
Both of you.

01:13:59.176 --> 01:14:00.724
Dead?

01:14:02.746 --> 01:14:05.382
No, no, just because you see it happen,
doesn't mean it will.

01:14:05.482 --> 01:14:09.119
- Yeah, I know, maybe it won't happen.
- But everything else has come true.

01:14:09.219 --> 01:14:10.954
Hasn't it?

01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:15.793
Some of them are small like the
phones ringing and the doors locking.

01:14:15.893 --> 01:14:18.629
But no matter what I do,
they keep coming true!

01:14:18.729 --> 01:14:21.632
And the other ones like the girls in
the bunker, and the number on the wall...

01:14:21.732 --> 01:14:25.169
- ...I don't think I can stop them.
- Are you still having the visions?

01:14:25.269 --> 01:14:29.373
No. But I think I only saw things
that I'm actually going to see.

01:14:29.473 --> 01:14:31.341
So maybe if we can go
somewhere I haven't seen.

01:14:31.441 --> 01:14:36.313
Like the shelter. Somehow derail
the path we're on, change fate.

01:14:36.413 --> 01:14:38.254
It's worth a shot, isn't it?

01:14:39.249 --> 01:14:42.486
And what about you?
You see what happens to you?

01:14:42.586 --> 01:14:44.096
No.

01:14:45.556 --> 01:14:47.433
The shelter?

01:14:48.252 --> 01:14:49.794
Yeah.

01:14:50.394 --> 01:14:53.664
Hey, maybe you should just leave that here.

01:14:53.764 --> 01:14:57.268
- Why?
- He probably left it for us to take.

01:14:57.968 --> 01:15:01.205
Or maybe he wants us to leave it
so someone else can take it.

01:15:01.305 --> 01:15:03.176
Or have you seen that too?

01:15:06.276 --> 01:15:07.803
Yeah.

01:16:28.724 --> 01:16:30.798
Well, I went in the dorm first.

01:16:31.795 --> 01:16:34.264
- I'll do it.
- I don't think you have to worry.

01:16:34.364 --> 01:16:37.831
Wait. Why doesn't he have to worry?

01:16:39.336 --> 01:16:41.172
When you saw me...

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:43.806
...how do I...

01:16:49.509 --> 01:16:51.364
You drown.

01:16:53.183 --> 01:16:56.264
What? How could I drown?

01:16:57.354 --> 01:16:59.224
I just know what I saw.

01:17:02.459 --> 01:17:04.324
What about me?

01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:08.559
You die in a hallway.

01:17:10.307 --> 01:17:11.904
Hallway?

01:17:15.472 --> 01:17:20.012
This... this place is nothing but hallways.

01:17:25.948 --> 01:17:28.179
I'm gonna find the damn shelter.

01:17:56.146 --> 01:17:58.449
Asshole, open the door.

01:18:02.119 --> 01:18:04.772
Open the door or I'm gonna beat your ass!

01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:10.079
Just stop being a dick
and open the damn door!

01:18:10.861 --> 01:18:12.397
No.

01:18:14.631 --> 01:18:17.200
At least help us figure out
what we're up against.

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.229
Tell us about Paskell.

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:56.317
Should have seen that coming.

01:20:18.787 --> 01:20:22.896
My partner and I had been testing...

01:20:22.996 --> 01:20:26.545
...memory formula for many years. But...

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:30.000
...Paskell was the first who had
visions as a side effect.

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:34.332
And not just visions, but his actual future.

01:20:34.972 --> 01:20:36.556
His foresight.

01:20:36.656 --> 01:20:40.945
- So you gave him more, didn't you?
- Oh, it was very promising.

01:20:42.345 --> 01:20:45.115
We continued experimenting as we modified it.

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:47.050
Yes, of course.

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:48.618
And?

01:20:48.718 --> 01:20:51.408
We discovered the effects are cumulative.

01:20:51.508 --> 01:20:57.572
He had a psychotic break and began
experiencing visions of violence.

01:20:58.548 --> 01:21:03.033
- So you stopped dosing him?
- Yes, but the visions continued.

01:21:03.133 --> 01:21:06.069
His brain somehow began
producing the effects.

01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:09.490
Much like an addicts
produce an opiate response.

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:14.044
And he stopped experiencing time as linear.

01:21:14.144 --> 01:21:16.513
Past, present, future...

01:21:16.613 --> 01:21:19.058
...it all existed simultaneously.

01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:23.200
It drove him mad, he had to be committed.

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:26.458
And that didn't stop you
from putting that stuff into us?

01:21:28.058 --> 01:21:31.261
Every worthwhile discovery has risk.

01:21:33.063 --> 01:21:36.099
The goal is to make that risk...

01:21:36.199 --> 01:21:40.264
...in this case, side effects, reasonable.

01:21:40.364 --> 01:21:44.307
Oh, yeah, yeah, very reasonable.
So side effects may include...

01:21:44.407 --> 01:21:48.645
...hallucinations, psychosis,
killing everyone you've ever met.

01:21:48.745 --> 01:21:51.616
Hey, but at least
there's no anal leakage, right?

01:21:52.816 --> 01:21:54.986
Not in this version, no.

01:21:56.186 --> 01:21:58.044
I wanna kill this guy!

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:03.393
Remember this?

01:22:03.493 --> 01:22:05.515
He's not after us, is he?

01:22:05.895 --> 01:22:09.166
He's just using us to try
to force you to kill yourself.

01:22:09.766 --> 01:22:11.802
It would seem so.

01:22:12.152 --> 01:22:14.058
My partner died last night.

01:22:15.338 --> 01:22:17.407
Probably trying to save his family.

01:22:17.507 --> 01:22:21.062
And yet you're hiding out
in a bomb shelter, leaving us to die.

01:22:22.912 --> 01:22:24.719
You're not my family.

01:22:27.884 --> 01:22:31.689
Has it not occurred to you that Paskell
might know you'd hide out in here?

01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:35.794
Well, yes, of course, but there aren't
many options, are there?

01:22:37.394 --> 01:22:40.730
- I'll take my chances in here.
- You bastard!

01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:43.271
This is your problem, not ours!

01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:47.405
I'm in here and you're out there. So...

01:22:47.505 --> 01:22:50.206
...actually this is very much your problem.

01:22:56.913 --> 01:23:00.150
See the future. See the future.

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:02.490
This stupid drug doesn't even work.

01:23:10.359 --> 01:23:12.637
Okay, okay.

01:24:26.568 --> 01:24:30.273
- You know what I don't understand?
- Why Paskell doesn't just kill that guy?

01:24:30.373 --> 01:24:33.043
Yeah, why doesn't he just walk up
and shoot him in the face?

01:24:33.143 --> 01:24:37.681
I don't know. Maybe it's like... like Anna.

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:41.280
He sees things that are gonna happen
but he doesn't control them.

01:24:47.122 --> 01:24:50.813
How 'bout it, asshole? Does he control
the visions or do they control him?

01:24:55.365 --> 01:24:57.394
It's impossible to say.

01:25:05.974 --> 01:25:08.224
What if somebody were to kill him?

01:25:09.095 --> 01:25:11.614
Would his visions still
come true after he's dead?

01:25:15.952 --> 01:25:17.966
That's an excellent question.

01:25:24.059 --> 01:25:26.864
So I'm thinking we just stay here.

01:25:27.464 --> 01:25:30.539
Arm up the best we can and make our stand.

01:25:31.881 --> 01:25:34.115
Look, at least we'll see him coming.

01:25:34.754 --> 01:25:37.046
And there's no water down here.

01:25:39.809 --> 01:25:41.678
Why'd you come back?

01:25:42.078 --> 01:25:43.947
What do you mean?

01:25:44.047 --> 01:25:46.182
Marcus said you were outside.

01:25:46.282 --> 01:25:49.619
Why'd you come back for me?
You hardly know me.

01:25:49.719 --> 01:25:51.922
I mean, we came back for everyone.

01:25:52.522 --> 01:25:54.032
But...

01:25:55.029 --> 01:25:57.169
...I'd like to know you, Anna.

01:26:03.699 --> 01:26:05.902
Well, that can't happen.

01:26:06.402 --> 01:26:09.539
Not anymore, not after that asshole
sentenced us to die.

01:26:09.639 --> 01:26:11.674
No, don't give up.

01:26:11.774 --> 01:26:14.419
Whatever happens we can't give up.

01:26:15.011 --> 01:26:19.003
Why not?
We're just prolonging the inevitable.

01:26:20.449 --> 01:26:22.319
What are you talking about?

01:26:22.619 --> 01:26:25.288
He knows everything. Remember?

01:26:25.388 --> 01:26:29.421
Why would he go through all of this trouble
just make Jerums commit suicide?

01:26:30.026 --> 01:26:32.429
He's getting rid of the drug, Den.

01:26:32.529 --> 01:26:34.364
Every last trace.

01:26:35.264 --> 01:26:39.235
- And that includes us.
- Not you. You took a placebo.

01:26:39.335 --> 01:26:42.292
You could just hide in a corner,
wait for the cavalry.

01:26:42.392 --> 01:26:44.941
- He doesn't know that.
- Sure he does, she just said it.

01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:50.113
He knows everything. Which is why we need
to do something that he doesn't expect.

01:26:50.513 --> 01:26:53.683
Okay, so I was talking to dickless
over there and I got an idea.

01:26:53.783 --> 01:26:55.919
What if we can get one
step ahead of these visions...

01:26:56.019 --> 01:26:59.422
...and do something
that hasn't been seen yet?

01:26:59.522 --> 01:27:02.705
Well, that's a big if. I mean,
we don't know what his visions are.

01:27:02.805 --> 01:27:04.794
Or where he is.

01:27:04.894 --> 01:27:08.831
I know, but think about it, okay?

01:27:08.931 --> 01:27:12.143
She told us how she saw us die. So...

01:27:12.743 --> 01:27:14.537
...what if...

01:27:14.637 --> 01:27:17.561
...she didn't see it, would it still happen?

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:20.977
Are we talking about Paskell or Anna?

01:27:21.077 --> 01:27:24.354
I'm not saying we hurt her,
we just... we tie her up.

01:27:24.454 --> 01:27:29.190
- It's practically self defense, man.
- Step back... now.

01:27:35.991 --> 01:27:38.995
Relax, just relax.

01:27:39.095 --> 01:27:41.498
It's just an idea. We're figuring stuff out.

01:27:41.598 --> 01:27:45.602
- Figure something else.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:49.779 --> 01:27:52.745
- Look around, see if there's any way out!
- No, is it happening now?

01:27:52.845 --> 01:27:54.727
Is it my turn now?

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:02.185
Hey, come on, man, come on. Please let us in.

01:28:02.285 --> 01:28:05.539
We will tell the cops that you saved us!
You'll be a hero! Come on!

01:28:05.639 --> 01:28:08.926
You guys there's another door
over here! Come on!

01:28:09.487 --> 01:28:12.174
Oh, no. He's gonna kill me now, isn't he?

01:28:12.274 --> 01:28:15.755
- I don't know, Marcus, I don't know!
- Marcus, help me!

01:28:23.472 --> 01:28:25.545
- Did you see that coming?
- Marcus!

01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:29.902
Marcus, no.

01:29:35.344 --> 01:29:36.846
No!

01:29:36.946 --> 01:29:38.100
Marcus!

01:29:42.852 --> 01:29:44.401
Marcus!

01:29:55.130 --> 01:29:57.431
No, no, no.

01:29:59.536 --> 01:30:01.398
Is he...

01:30:03.272 --> 01:30:04.807
Yeah.

01:30:10.478 --> 01:30:12.950
Where's Paskell, why would he just leave?

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.270
He never meant to come down.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.989
He knew he didn't need to.

01:30:20.561 --> 01:30:22.402
He knew.

01:30:24.727 --> 01:30:26.429
There's no way.

01:30:26.529 --> 01:30:28.798
No, no, no, listen to me. You cannot give up.

01:30:28.898 --> 01:30:32.569
- There has to be something.
- What, some way to change the future?

01:30:33.269 --> 01:30:35.838
- What if Marcus was right?
- I should kill you?

01:30:35.938 --> 01:30:40.309
No, no, no, no, I mean, if we are nowhere
near each other how can I see you die?

01:30:40.409 --> 01:30:43.715
- And if I can't see you die...
- Will it still happen?

01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:48.885
No, no, it's too dangerous
being trapped inside like this.

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:51.848
- Den.
- Anna...

01:30:51.948 --> 01:30:54.190
...even if it means I'm going to die...

01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:57.493
...I'm not leaving you in here
alone with him.

01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:06.970
- It can't be that simple.
- What?

01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:09.305
Come on, we're getting out of here.

01:31:17.011 --> 01:31:19.865
- Oh, not more stairs.
- Come on!

01:31:25.054 --> 01:31:26.990
- Here, here.
- No, no, are you crazy?

01:31:27.090 --> 01:31:30.493
- This is way too high, we cannot jump.
- Maybe, come on.

01:31:32.114 --> 01:31:33.916
Look at that snow drift.

01:31:34.263 --> 01:31:37.552
It's deep, Anna, we can make it. Come on.

01:31:53.915 --> 01:31:57.391
- I can't do this.
- Anna, look at me.

01:32:04.292 --> 01:32:06.129
We jump on three.

01:32:08.998 --> 01:32:13.081
One, two, three.

01:32:39.394 --> 01:32:42.999
What are you doing?
You said you wouldn't leave me alone!

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:45.448
I said I wouldn't leave you alone in here!

01:32:45.668 --> 01:32:48.492
My keys are in the jacket! Go get help!

01:32:49.505 --> 01:32:52.308
Den! Den!

01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:26.776
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

01:33:27.376 --> 01:33:31.197
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:36.570
I'm so sorry, oh, my God.

01:33:39.122 --> 01:33:40.676
Okay.

01:34:08.616 --> 01:34:10.440
What did you do?

01:34:26.002 --> 01:34:28.071
What are you waiting for?

01:34:28.521 --> 01:34:30.600
You already know where I'm going.

01:34:32.308 --> 01:34:34.031
That makes one of us.

01:34:49.655 --> 01:34:51.478
Son of a bitch.

01:34:56.899 --> 01:34:58.551
Paskell!

01:35:27.302 --> 01:35:29.138
I was wrong.

01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:57.607
Hey!

01:35:58.194 --> 01:36:02.165
I saw Kristen dead in the bathroom
but I just found her outside.

01:36:02.565 --> 01:36:05.220
These visions don't always
come true, do they?

01:36:06.268 --> 01:36:08.628
Did you tell the others how they died?

01:36:08.838 --> 01:36:10.923
Everyone except Kristen.

01:36:14.043 --> 01:36:15.945
This isn't fate, is it?

01:36:16.045 --> 01:36:18.417
It's more like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

01:36:19.982 --> 01:36:21.552
Well...

01:36:21.952 --> 01:36:25.321
...certainly by telling them
you influence their behavior.

01:36:25.421 --> 01:36:28.629
And therefore the outcome.

01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:33.429
And what about Paskell?

01:36:33.529 --> 01:36:35.732
Do his visions always come true?

01:36:36.452 --> 01:36:39.565
It's hard to say. He sees so much.

01:36:39.835 --> 01:36:42.839
Because the drug is cumulative, right?
And he's had a lot.

01:36:42.939 --> 01:36:44.812
He has.

01:36:54.349 --> 01:36:56.080
What are you looking for?

01:37:06.394 --> 01:37:10.651
That's not your drug you use.
That's the property of this facility.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.903
Stop and listen to me,
the dosage is too high.

01:37:14.003 --> 01:37:16.608
You won't be able to control your visions.

01:37:17.673 --> 01:37:19.962
Remind me to tell you how you die.

01:37:34.789 --> 01:37:36.360
Paskell!

01:37:36.926 --> 01:37:38.755
Let's get this over with.

01:37:51.674 --> 01:37:53.491
Hello, Den.

01:38:00.048 --> 01:38:03.853
- Don't move or I'll...
- Take my head off.

01:38:03.953 --> 01:38:05.788
I know.

01:38:06.188 --> 01:38:08.073
I know.

01:38:09.291 --> 01:38:11.488
Don't swing so hard.

01:38:13.062 --> 01:38:14.818
You'll tire yourself out.

01:38:15.731 --> 01:38:17.566
You won't be able to run.

01:38:27.842 --> 01:38:29.712
Watch your step.

01:38:36.651 --> 01:38:38.921
Get off, get off me!

01:38:39.021 --> 01:38:40.889
I'll kill you!

01:38:49.531 --> 01:38:51.413
Why are you doing this?

01:38:51.968 --> 01:38:54.202
I really wish you could surprise me.

01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:56.590
Paskell!

01:40:35.803 --> 01:40:37.882
Why are you doing this?

01:40:40.376 --> 01:40:41.988
Paskell!

01:40:44.763 --> 01:40:46.279
Den!

01:41:56.392 --> 01:41:58.554
Why have I not been able to contact you?

01:41:58.654 --> 01:42:02.491
What are you doing here? Are you aware
there's a car parked in my lobby?

01:42:02.591 --> 01:42:04.660
- Please, shut the door.
- Forget the door!

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:08.564
- Shut the door!
- Have you finally lost your mind?

01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:10.983
Why are you here?

01:42:11.083 --> 01:42:14.870
Why do you think I'm here?
I've been calling you all night!

01:42:14.970 --> 01:42:19.174
Driving through a blinding snow storm to
find out what the hell's been going on...

01:42:19.274 --> 01:42:22.110
...with my study!

01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:04.683
It's gonna be okay.

01:43:05.521 --> 01:43:07.246
Hold on!

01:43:07.346 --> 01:43:09.272
Hold on!

01:43:09.372 --> 01:43:12.431
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

01:43:18.232 --> 01:43:20.669
It's gonna be okay, hold on.
