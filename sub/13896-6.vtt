WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:05.920
YES, I KNOW. I KNOW.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.210
-WE HAVE A JOB, REMEMBER?

-[JAKE] ALL RIGHT.

00:08.250 --> 00:11.050
JUST, YOU KNOW, WOULD YOU,
YOU KNOW, GIVE ME
A FEW MINUTES, ALL RIGHT?

00:11.090 --> 00:13.680
ARE YOU PLANNING
ON GETTING YOUR OWN APARTMENT
ANYTIME SOON?

00:13.720 --> 00:16.720
UH, HOLD ON...
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.100
JAKE, I'M SERIOUS
ABOUT YOUR APARTMENT.

00:19.140 --> 00:21.520
YEAH, I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE A GROWN MAN, RIGHT?

00:21.560 --> 00:23.310
HELLO? JAKE?

00:23.350 --> 00:25.110
[JAKE] DAD, UH,
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME UM...

00:26.270 --> 00:27.440
10 MINUTES, I GOTTA
JUMP IN THE SHOWER.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.030
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MAKE IT HALF AN HOUR,
45 MINUTES.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.080
[PRIEST] IN THE NAME OF GOD,
JACOB PROTECTOR.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.040
MAY HE SEND YOU
HELPFUL SANCTUARY

00:42.080 --> 00:44.290
AND GRANT YOU SUPPORT
FROM ZION

00:44.330 --> 00:46.500
AND MAY HE REMEMBER
ALL YOUR SACRIFICES.

00:46.540 --> 00:49.750
IT'S A FUNERAL,
HAVE SOME RESPECT.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.460
-PETE RYAN WAS A FRIEND
OF THE FAMILY.
-SORRY.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.590
I'LL THROW IT AWAY.

00:57.010 --> 00:58.930
[MAL] PETE RYAN
WAS LOST AT SEA.

00:58.970 --> 01:00.970
PORTRAIT WAS A NICE TOUCH.
HE WAS A HANDSOME FELLA.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.270
-HERE'S KIMBERLY.
-MALACHY.

01:05.140 --> 01:07.310
HI, JAKE.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.270
KIM, I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.320
WELL, IT ALWAYS TAKES
A FUNERAL TO SEE OLD FRIENDS,
RIGHT?

01:11.360 --> 01:14.400
KIM, YOUR FATHER
WAS A GREAT FRIEND.

01:15.070 --> 01:16.320
HE'LL BE MISSED.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.160
[JAKE] ANYTHING THAT
WE CAN DO TO HELP.
ANYTHING AT ALL,

01:18.200 --> 01:20.950
YOU CAN JUST TELL US, OKAY?
YOU'RE FAMILY. SO...

01:20.990 --> 01:23.450
&lt;STUTTERS&gt;
I CALLED YOU BECAUSE...
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

01:23.500 --> 01:25.790
SOMETHING ISN'T SITTING RIGHT
ABOUT DAD'S DEATH.

01:25.830 --> 01:29.670
I JUST, I CAN'T SEEM TO SHAKE
THIS, UM, UNEASY FEELING.

01:29.710 --> 01:31.170
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "UNEASY"?
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

01:31.210 --> 01:35.260
UH... I AM SO, SO SORRY.

01:35.300 --> 01:36.760
-TURN THAT THING OFF.
-[JAKE] I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.470
-HI.
-I MEANT TO MENTION TO YOU,

01:40.510 --> 01:42.220
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
FOR A DEPOSITION.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.930
[JAKE] A LEGAL DEPOSITION,

01:43.980 --> 01:46.810
-THAT'S REALLY HOT. -YEAH, ON THE PARSONS CASE.

01:46.850 --> 01:48.150
AND I WANNA

01:48.190 --> 01:50.440

01:50.480 --> 01:52.730
JUST, UH, MEET ME

01:52.780 --> 01:54.360
I DON'T KNOW, 8:00, MAYBE?

01:54.400 --> 01:59.410
-DID YOU LEAVE ME KEYS?
-TO... MY APARTMENT.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.530
THEY'RE OVER BY THE...
BY THE SINK.

02:04.580 --> 02:08.210
-ARE YOU OKAY WITH ME
HAVING KEYS? -UH... YEAH.

02:08.250 --> 02:10.170
UH, YEAH...

02:10.210 --> 02:12.300

I'LL SEE YA TONIGHT.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.380
-REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.
-[GORDIE] YOU'RE BRINGIN'
THAT UP HERE?

02:16.420 --> 02:18.970
THE MAN'S DEAD. HE'S GONE.
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE!

02:19.010 --> 02:21.720
-$50,000 IS NO JOKE!
-HEY, LEAVE HIM ALONE.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.220
THAT IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT,
RIGHT THERE. THE PITTMANS.

02:24.270 --> 02:27.270
THEY WERE MY FATHER'S PARTNERS
ON THE CRAB BOAT.
THE PITTMANS...

02:27.310 --> 02:28.600
LOOK, DON'T TALK
TO MY FATHER THAT WAY.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.860
THEY'RE A TANGLY BUNCH
SOMETIMES.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.940
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
-I THINK ONE OF THEM
MURDERED MY DAD.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.110
&lt;INDISTINCT SHOUTING&gt;

02:37.400 --> 02:39.910
DON'T SPEAK
TO MY FATHER THAT WAY.

02:40.820 --> 02:42.450
&lt;ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY&gt;

02:43.870 --> 02:44.870
YOU OKAY?

02:46.330 --> 02:47.500
&lt;SHOUTING&gt;

02:56.050 --> 02:58.050
&lt;THEME SONG PLAYING&gt;

03:01.550 --> 03:03.390
-♪OH, YEAH♪
-♪OH, YEAH♪

03:04.560 --> 03:06.390
-♪ OH, YEAH ♪

03:13.440 --> 03:15.280
♪ OH, YEAH ♪

03:26.910 --> 03:28.200
THEY SAID THAT
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

03:28.250 --> 03:29.870
BUT THAT JUST
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.250
THERE WAS SOME
BIG FEUD GOING ON.

03:32.290 --> 03:34.460
-[MAL] WITH THE
PITTMAN BROTHERS?
-YEAH.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.300
DAD CALLED ME
AND THERE WAS
SOMETHING WITH HIS VOICE,

03:36.340 --> 03:38.130
I COULD TELL.
HE SAID "DON'T WORRY,

03:38.170 --> 03:39.920
"EVERYTHING WILL BE
ALL RIGHT."

03:39.970 --> 03:42.340
SO, I GOT ON
THE FIRST FLIGHT HOME,
BUT I WAS TOO LATE.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.550
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
ABOUT THIS FEUD?

03:44.600 --> 03:48.020
GORDIE PITTMAN
INJURED HIS BACK ON THE BOAT,

03:48.060 --> 03:49.430
SAID IT WAS DAD'S FAULT.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.270
HE BLAMED PETE?

03:50.310 --> 03:53.810
GORDIE PITTMAN, REG PITTMAN
AND THERE'S DAD.

03:55.230 --> 03:57.440
HMM. THOSE WERE HAPPIER TIMES,
I GUESS, HUH?

04:01.070 --> 04:04.240
WHEN MY WIFE PASSED AWAY,
YEARS AGO, YOU TWO WERE KIDS.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.450
I REMEMBER,
SAME TIME MOM DIED.

04:06.490 --> 04:09.500
[MAL] PETE AND I,
WE LEANED ON EACH OTHER
PRETTY HEAVILY.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.290
-HE WAS A GREAT MAN.
-&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

04:15.710 --> 04:17.340
HI, KIM?

04:17.380 --> 04:20.300
-CAN I HELP YOU?
-HI, I'M LISA.

04:20.340 --> 04:21.920
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.390
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE TO HAVE THIS.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.600
-YOU WERE AT
THE SERVICE EARLIER.
-[LISA] YEAH, I'M A PAINTER.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.060
I'VE BEEN RENTING
THE SUMMER HOUSE
FROM PETE.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.520
HE WAS A REAL GENTLEMAN,

04:30.560 --> 04:31.730
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;
GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.690
THAT YOUR WORK? IT'S GREAT.

04:33.730 --> 04:36.480
&lt;HE PAID ME WITH
THREE MONTHS FREE RENT.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.320
IT BELONGS TO YOU NOW.
BUT I THOUGHT...

04:40.280 --> 04:41.740
IT WOULD LOOK GREAT...

04:42.490 --> 04:44.780
IN THE DINING ROOM.

04:44.820 --> 04:48.490
THAT'S OKAY.
UM, I... I CAN DO THIS.
THANK YOU.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.290
OF COURSE. I, UM...

04:52.500 --> 04:53.460
ANYWAY...

04:54.500 --> 04:56.420
HE WAS A... SUCH A NICE MAN.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.000
IF THERE'S ANYTHING AT ALL
I CAN DO...

04:58.040 --> 04:59.460
THANK YOU.

05:03.340 --> 05:05.180
&lt;DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES&gt;

05:06.890 --> 05:08.050
I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.310
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FATHER.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.520
[MAL] THAT PAINTER GIRL SEEMED
PRETTY AT HOME IN THE HOUSE.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.320
YEAH. SHE KNEW EXACTLY
WHERE TO FIND THAT HAMMER, EH?

05:20.360 --> 05:22.320
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT MAYBE, UH...

05:22.360 --> 05:23.570
YOU DON'T THINK THAT MAYBE
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

05:23.610 --> 05:25.450
SOMETHING GOIN' ON
BETWEEN HER AND PETE?

05:25.490 --> 05:27.160
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE APPEAL

05:27.200 --> 05:29.410
OF THE VIRILE OLDER MAN.

05:29.450 --> 05:31.490
-GENTLEMEN.
-HOW'S BUSINESS?

05:31.540 --> 05:33.290
NEVER BETTER.
CAN I TALK TO YA FOR A SEC?

05:33.330 --> 05:34.370
IT'S IMPORTANT.

05:34.410 --> 05:37.040

-&lt;DOOR BUZZES&gt;

05:39.630 --> 05:40.920
WHAT'S ALL OF THIS?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.130
-I NEED TO SELL THE BAR.
-HE NEEDS TO SELL THE BAR.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.680
THIS IS LIKE,
OUR PLAN FROM WAY BACK.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.970
THERE'S NO NEED TO ENJOY
MY SUFFERIN' SO MUCH.

05:48.010 --> 05:50.300
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; SORRY.
BUT HE'S GOTTA SELL IT FAST.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.310
SO, LISTEN UP.

05:52.350 --> 05:53.980
I CAN GET MY HANDS ON
HALF THAT DOWN PAYMENT.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.400
8% DOWN IS 40 GRAND EACH.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.440
WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU COMING UP
WITH THIS KINDA MONEY?

06:00.480 --> 06:01.770
I GOT INVESTMENTS.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.530
[TERRY] IF I DON'T
SELL THE PLACE,
IT'LL GO TO MY EX-WIFE.

06:04.570 --> 06:05.820
&lt;STUTTERS&gt;

06:05.860 --> 06:07.610

06:07.660 --> 06:09.780
YOU AND ME, WORKING TOGETHER.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.780
SOMETHING TO FALL BACK ON
WHEN WE'RE OLD AND STUPID.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.410
I DON'T HAVE
THIS KINDA MONEY, CHRISTIAN

06:15.450 --> 06:17.080
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU DON'T EITHER.

06:19.830 --> 06:21.500

06:31.600 --> 06:32.600
&lt;DOOR BUZZING&gt;

06:33.640 --> 06:34.850
-VERY FUNNY.
-&lt;CHRISTIAN CHUCKLES&gt;

06:38.730 --> 06:41.190
[ROSE] OKAY, GORDIE PITTMAN
WAS THE ONLY OTHER MAN
ON THE BOAT

06:41.230 --> 06:42.570
WHEN PETE DISAPPEARED.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.360
AND ACCORDING
TO THIS POLICE REPORT,

06:44.400 --> 06:46.530
GORDIE SAYS IT WAS
A "FREAK ACCIDENT,

06:46.570 --> 06:47.950
"A ROGUE WAVE."

06:47.990 --> 06:49.360
REALLY? A "ROGUE WAVE?"

06:49.410 --> 06:50.990
WHAT ABOUT GORDIE'S BROTHER?

06:51.030 --> 06:52.580
REG PITTMAN WASN'T ON BOARD.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.620
BUT ALL THREE HAD EQUAL
SHARES ON THE BOAT, RIGHT?

06:54.660 --> 06:55.660
WHO'S THAT GUY
RIGHT UP THERE ON THE CORNER?

06:56.700 --> 06:58.370
[MAL] ALEX PITTMAN,
GORDIE'S SON.

06:58.410 --> 06:59.670
HE'S AN ENGINEER
WITH THE CITY.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.540
[DES] HE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S MURDERIN' SOMEONE
RIGHT THERE.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.290
HE NEEDS TO
RELIEVE HIS STRESS, MAN.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.090
TELL HIM TO TRY MEDITATION.

07:05.130 --> 07:07.920
UH, THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
UNFOLDED AS FOLLOWS, DES...

07:07.970 --> 07:08.970
[DES] YEAH.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.340
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

07:12.090 --> 07:13.640
UM, 5:00 A.M.,

07:13.680 --> 07:14.810
CRAB BOAT LEAVES THE HARBOR

07:14.850 --> 07:17.140
AND PROCEEDS,
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS,

07:17.180 --> 07:20.900
TO THIS SPOT HERE-ISH.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.860
GIVE OR TAKE.

07:22.900 --> 07:26.530
-THEN WHAT?
-[DES] UH, UH, 6:47 A.M.,
S.O.S. CALL GOES OUT.

07:26.570 --> 07:29.450
7:00 A.M., SEARCH
AND RESCUE COMMENCES,

07:29.490 --> 07:32.240
BUT ALAS,
THE BODY WAS NEVER FOUND.

07:33.530 --> 07:35.120
&lt;MOUTHING&gt;

07:36.740 --> 07:39.210
DAD, ANY CHANCE THAT PETE
MIGHT HAVE, YOU KNOW,

07:39.250 --> 07:40.330
COMMITTED SUICIDE?

07:40.670 --> 07:41.920
NO, NOT PETE.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.040
MAYBE HE WAS SICK
OR SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW, HAD CANCER.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.710
IT'S CERTAINLY
A CLEANER WAY OUT.

07:45.750 --> 07:46.800
YOU KNOW WHAT? I LOOKED
INTO HIS MEDICAL HISTORY,

07:46.840 --> 07:48.130
HE WAS HEALTHY AS A HORSE...

07:48.170 --> 07:49.970
A LITTLE HIGH CHOLESTEROL,
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.340
KIM SEEMS TO THINK
THERE WAS FOUL PLAY.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.590
YOU KNOW, THE BUSINESS
HAD AN INSURANCE POLICY.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.680
ACCIDENTAL DEATH,
SAY FROM A ROGUE WAVE.

07:57.270 --> 07:58.640
PAYS A JACKPOT.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.390
SOUNDS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS.

08:00.430 --> 08:01.600
DES, CALL THE COASTGUARD.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.560
SEE IF YOU CAN GET A COPY
OF THAT S.O.S. TAPE.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.360
ROGER THAT, BIG DADDY.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.110
DAD, YOU AND ME, LET'S GO
PAY A VISIT TO THE PITTMANS.

08:08.150 --> 08:10.240
-SEE YA, HUN.
-BYE, DARLING.

08:15.830 --> 08:18.290
[MAL] THIS BAR DEAL
WITH YOU AND CHRISTIAN,

08:18.330 --> 08:20.450
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.170
I GOT SOME MONEY SET ASIDE.
I'LL PUT UP YOUR HALF.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.250
MY HALF?

08:25.290 --> 08:27.840
NEVER MIND ABOUT MY HALF.
WHERE THE HELL IS CHRISTIAN
GETTING HIS HALF?

08:27.880 --> 08:29.550
YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME FAITH
IN YOUR BROTHER.

08:29.590 --> 08:31.550
HE'S MAKING A GO OF IT.
HE NEEDS OUR SUPPORT.

08:31.590 --> 08:33.510
WHATEVER.

08:33.550 --> 08:34.890
THIS IS GORDIE'S BOAT HERE,
I THINK.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.100
GORDIE? GORDIE PITTMAN?

08:40.980 --> 08:44.480
-HI.
-YOU TWO WERE AT THE FUNERAL.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.690
IF YOU'RE WITH
THOSE INSURANCE TURDS,
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YA...

08:46.730 --> 08:49.610
NO LOOK, WE'RE NOT WITH
ANY INSURANCE TURDS.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.690
I'M AN OLD FRIEND OF PETE'S
FROM BACK IN THE DAY.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.320
KIM RYAN JUST WANTS
TO KNOW MORE

08:53.360 --> 08:55.820
ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF HER FATHER'S DEATH.

08:57.830 --> 09:01.120
IT'S QUITE A BAD BACK
FOR YOU TO HAVE
GOIN' ON THERE, GORD.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.660
[GORDIE] IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.250
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE WATER?

09:05.290 --> 09:07.710
WE UNDERSTAND
YOU WERE THE ONLY
OTHER PERSON THERE.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.800
I WENT BELOW
'CAUSE THE ENGINE WAS STALLED.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.170
THE FUEL FILTER WAS CLOGGED.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.300
WHEN I CAME BACK UP
TO GET THE PART...

09:16.800 --> 09:19.470
HE WAS AWAY AND GONE...
ROGUE WAVE.

09:19.510 --> 09:20.510
REALLY?

09:21.270 --> 09:22.520
IT HAPPENS.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.890
MAYBE WE COULD COME ABOARD,
YOU KNOW, HAVE A LOOK AROUND,

09:24.940 --> 09:27.150
-SEE WHERE PETE WENT OVER.
-[GORDIE] SURE.

09:27.190 --> 09:29.230
GOIN' OUT FOR A FIVE-HOUR RUN.

09:29.270 --> 09:30.270
BY YOURSELF?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.950
THAT'S ONE BAD BACK
TO BE HAULIN' CRAB POTS
IN WITH, GORDIE.

09:41.620 --> 09:44.250
LOOK, YOU GO FIND
GORDIE'S BROTHER, REG.

09:44.290 --> 09:46.920
I'LL GO CHECK OUT HIS SON,
SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.670
AND MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
ABOUT THIS WHOLE BAR THING,
ALL RIGHT?

09:53.840 --> 09:55.590
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"MIND MY OWN BUSINESS?"

09:55.630 --> 09:56.630
IT'S MY SON.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.100
-&lt;CHILDREN LAUGHING&gt;
-[ALEX] BOYS,

10:00.140 --> 10:02.720
BOYS, I SAID KNOCK IT OFF,
I SAID!

10:04.310 --> 10:05.810
MY DAD'S THE REAL VICTIM
IN ALL THIS.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.150
HE WAS TOTALLY SHAFTED
BY PETE RYAN.

10:09.190 --> 10:11.400
-GORDIE WAS SHAFTED HOW?
-[ALEX] HE SCREWED UP
HIS BACK.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.150
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT
ON THE BOAT LAST YEAR.

10:13.190 --> 10:14.820
IT WAS ALL PETE'S FAULT

10:14.860 --> 10:16.150
AND NOW MY DAD'S
GOING TO BE
IN CONSTANT PAIN

10:16.200 --> 10:17.530
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.070
-REALLY?
-AND THEN PETE RYAN GOES

10:19.120 --> 10:20.830
AND SCREWS UP
THE INSURANCE CLAIM.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.740
MY DAD DOESN'T GET
A NICKEL IN COMPENSATION.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.250
PLUS PETE WAS
COOKIN' THE BOOKS.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.330
MONEY WAS MISSIN',
DISSAPEARIN'.
AND I CAN PROVE THAT.

10:27.370 --> 10:29.130
YOU THINK THAT PETE WAS
STEALIN' MONEY FROM GORDIE?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.380
YES.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.430
DAD LIVES WITH ME, NOW.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.510
HE LOVES IT HERE.

10:41.550 --> 10:44.430
BOYS! LOOK, I'M NOT
TELLIN' YOU AGAIN, ALL RIGHT!

10:44.470 --> 10:45.890
-&lt;GIGGLING&gt;
-KNOCK IT OFF.

10:45.930 --> 10:47.060
THAT'S YOUR
GRANDFATHER'S ROOM.

10:48.140 --> 10:49.690
KEEPS IT LOCKED
'CAUSE HE LIKES HIS PRIVACY.

10:49.730 --> 10:50.810
LOOK, PETE DIED.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.770
DAD WENT BELOW
WHEN THE ENGINE STALLED,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.360
IT WAS THE FUEL FILTER
THAT WAS CLOGGED.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.150
WHEN HE CAME BACK UP,
THERE HE WAS, GONE.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.570
IT WAS A ROGUE WAVE.

10:58.610 --> 11:00.200
THOSE WERE THE WORDS
YOUR FATHER USED,

11:00.240 --> 11:02.450
I MEAN, HIS EXACT WORDS.

11:02.490 --> 11:05.490
LOOK, I'M REAL SORRY
PETE RYAN DIED,
REALLY, I AM.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.750
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WAS ABOUT TIME
MY FATHER RETIRED

11:07.790 --> 11:09.790
AND IF THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK
THEN THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK.

11:17.550 --> 11:20.090
[MAL] SO, YOUR BROTHER GORDIE
TOLD US TO COME TALK TO YOU.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.720
[REG] I HAVEN'T SET FOOT
ON THAT BOAT ALL YEAR.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.350
THEY BOOTED ME OFF,
PETE AND GORDIE.

11:25.390 --> 11:26.720
[MAL] WHY WOULD THEY
DO THAT, REG?

11:26.770 --> 11:28.850
[REG] WELL, IT'S BEEN
A SLOW YEAR FOR CRAB.

11:28.890 --> 11:31.400
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN
THEY DECIDED TO GO
WITH A TWO-MAN BOAT.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.520
IT WAS ALL PETE'S IDEA.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.730
TURNED MY OWN BROTHER
AGAINST ME.

11:34.770 --> 11:36.730
MUST HAVE BUILT UP
A LOT OF RESENTMENT.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.440
WHO'D YOU SAY YOU WERE?

11:38.490 --> 11:39.860
FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.570
-AH, RYAN FAMILY.
-THAT'S RIGHT.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.410
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO
SPEAK ILL OF THE DEAD,

11:45.450 --> 11:47.500
BUT PETE RYAN WAS
A CROOK AND A SLEVEEN.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.950
HE WAS COOKIN' THE BOOKS,
RIPPIN' US OFF.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.500
REALLY?

11:50.540 --> 11:52.750
$50,000. CASH.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.880
ASK GORDIE,
HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.170
THAT'S MY MONEY, TOO!

11:56.210 --> 11:58.340
I'M A PARTNER.
PETE HAD NO RIGHT.

12:06.810 --> 12:07.810
WHAT'S THAT?

12:09.100 --> 12:10.100
ALL RIGHT.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.650
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.310
YOU MAKE NO DECISIONS
WITHOUT ME,

12:14.360 --> 12:15.770
YOU MAKE NO PURCHASES
WITHOUT ME,

12:15.810 --> 12:18.070
YOU SIGN NO CHECKS
WITHOUT MY SIGNATURE.

12:18.110 --> 12:21.360
YOU WANT A PARTNER...
I AM NOT THE SILENT TYPE.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.040
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

12:31.790 --> 12:32.790
GOOD.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.170
THIS IS GOOD.

12:35.210 --> 12:37.340
-YOU'RE NOT GONNA REGRET IT.
-I HOPE NOT.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.170
SEE,

12:40.090 --> 12:41.920
THIS IS HOW
BROTHERS SHOULD BE.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.720
WORKIN' TOGETHER,
HELPIN' EACH OTHER OUT...

12:47.100 --> 12:48.260
NEW BEGINNINGS.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.770
-&lt;GLASSES CLINK&gt;
-NEW BEGINNINGS.

12:54.060 --> 12:54.940
DON'T SCREW THIS UP.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.240
GORDIE WAS ALREADY
PISSED AT PETE

13:04.280 --> 13:05.950
FOR SHAGGING UP HIS BACK.

13:05.990 --> 13:07.780
REG WAS SAYIN' PETE
WAS RIPPIN' 'EM OFF,

13:07.830 --> 13:08.910
WHICH I FIND HARD TO BELIEVE.

13:08.950 --> 13:10.490
AND GORDIE GOES
AND GETS A POLICY

13:10.540 --> 13:13.000
THAT PAYS OUT DOUBLE
FOR ACCIDENTAL DEATH.

13:13.910 --> 13:15.330
ONE HELL OF A MOTIVE.

13:15.370 --> 13:16.750
ONE LITTLE PUSH, YOU KNOW,

13:16.790 --> 13:18.590
ALL OF HIS PROBLEMS
ARE SOLVED.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.920
PERMISSION TO COME ABOARD,
SKIPPER?

13:21.760 --> 13:22.760
GORDIE!

13:23.880 --> 13:25.010
[MAL] GORDIE.

13:25.590 --> 13:27.340
SO, UH...

13:27.390 --> 13:30.010
WHY DON'T I, UH, JUMP ABOARD
AND HAVE A LOOK, HUH?

13:40.900 --> 13:42.150
DAD!

13:49.200 --> 13:51.410
DAD. YOU OKAY?

13:52.290 --> 13:54.410
&lt;PANTING&gt; YEAH, I'M FINE.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.040
&lt;CAR ENGINE STARTING&gt;

14:01.210 --> 14:02.630
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

14:06.840 --> 14:09.930
-YOU ALL RIGHT?
-I'M FINE.

14:09.970 --> 14:11.890
BUT SOMEONE WANTS US
TO STOP DIGGIN' AROUND.

14:12.970 --> 14:13.850

14:22.480 --> 14:24.030

14:24.070 --> 14:26.900
THE PITTMAN BROTHERS
CONSPIRED TO KILL MY DAD,
I KNEW IT.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.620
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY THERE,
JUST YET, OKAY, KIM.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.910
WE UNDERSTAND YOUR FATHER
KEPT THE BOOKS
FOR THE BUSINESS.

14:31.950 --> 14:34.950
YEAH, &lt;STUTTERS&gt;
THEY'RE IN ONE OF THESE PILES,
SOMEWHERE. WHY?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.960
THE PITTMAN'S ARE
ACCUSING YOUR FATHER
OF STEALING FROM THEM.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.830
MAYBE UP TO $50,000.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.500
WE GOTTA CHECK THE BOOKS, KIM.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.550
-COULD SPEAK TO MOTIVE.
-[KIM] THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

14:43.590 --> 14:45.340
MY DAD WOULD NEVER...

15:00.350 --> 15:01.860
BUT I KNOW IT WAS HERE.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.070
THE ONE I SAW HERE EARLIER?

15:04.110 --> 15:06.030

15:06.070 --> 15:07.570

[GORDIE] WE ARE IN DISTRESS.
WE HAVE A MAN OVERBOARD.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.100
-THAT.
-[JAKE] EXACTLY.

16:20.140 --> 16:23.020
GORDIE SAID
THE ENGINE STALLED.
IT WAS NEVER BROKEN.

16:23.060 --> 16:24.560
HE GOES BELOW, ENGINE'S BROKE,

16:24.610 --> 16:27.480
HE COMES BACK UP,

OH, NORMALLY I WOULD DISAGREE

IN A STATEMENT TO JAKE

17:33.220 --> 17:35.930
YOU SAID THE BOAT STALLED,

-[LESLIE] YOU ALSO SAID

17:44.020 --> 17:45.100
THE BOAT NEEDED REPAIRS

17:45.140 --> 17:46.440
AND YOU REPLACED
A PART OF THE ENGINE.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.020
-IS THIS TRUE?
-[ALEX] IT WAS
THE FUEL FILTER.

17:49.060 --> 17:51.020

18:27.900 --> 18:29.020
COME ON, DAD.

18:31.190 --> 18:32.230
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

18:35.570 --> 18:38.160
-&lt;DOOR CLOSES&gt;
-LOOKS TO ME LIKE
WE TOUCHED A NERVE.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.320
MAYBE, BUT THERE'S NOTHIN'
TO GO ON YET.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.870
WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED
WHEN WE HAVE A LOOK
AT THE BOAT.

18:42.910 --> 18:44.910
JAKE, GOOD TO SEE YA.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.660
YOU LOOK GOOD.

18:47.330 --> 18:48.330
YOU LOOK LIKE A FREAK.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.960
JAKE, DON'T BE A JERK.

18:52.670 --> 18:55.050
COME ON, HOOD. DON'T MIND HIM.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.640
-HEY THERE, AWESOME.
-[ALLISON] HEY.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.180
UH, LISTEN.
I CAN'T MAKE IT TONIGHT.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.230
UH, IT'S A WORK THING.
CAN'T BE HELPED.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.310
ALL RIGHT, NO, &lt;STUTTERS&gt;
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

19:08.350 --> 19:10.190
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW? NOON?

19:10.230 --> 19:12.650
SOUNDS GREAT. DO YOU WANT ME
TO WEAR SOMETHING REVEALING?

19:12.690 --> 19:13.940
NO, WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING...

19:13.980 --> 19:16.440
-DEPOSITION, REMEMBER? -I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.280
OKAY, I GOTTA RUN.
I'LL SEE YA LATER.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.700
RIGHT, BYE.

19:19.740 --> 19:22.490
HE WASN'T ABLE TO TALK.
PINT?

19:24.410 --> 19:26.080
-HE PAY FOR THIS?
-NO.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.290
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I GOTTA TELL YA,

19:27.330 --> 19:29.290
NO FREE PINTS! TO ANYONE!

19:29.330 --> 19:31.170
YOU DO A FATHER'S HEART PROUD.

19:31.210 --> 19:32.670
IT'S A COUPLE PINTS,
RELAX, JAKE.

19:32.710 --> 19:35.300
A COUPLE PINTS?
LOOK, IT ALL ADDS UP,
CHRISTIAN, ALL RIGHT?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.800
-AND IF YOU'RE GIVIN'
FREE PINTS TO THIS ONE...
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

19:37.840 --> 19:39.300
...HE'LL DRINK US
TO THE GROUND, TRUST ME.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.260
-&lt;CHRISTIAN CHUCKLES&gt;
-WHAT?

19:41.300 --> 19:43.220
-THEY'RE FIGHTING.
-WHO? WHO'S FIGHTING?

19:43.260 --> 19:44.810
REG AND GORDIE!
THEY'RE HAVING A HUGE SCRAP.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.310
YOU'RE YOUNG,
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT!

19:46.350 --> 19:48.140
ME, I GOT NO OTHER OPTIONS!

19:48.180 --> 19:49.430
[REG] I'M GONNA
FIND THAT MONEY!

19:49.480 --> 19:51.190
MARK MY WORDS, GORDIE.

19:51.230 --> 19:53.190
LOOK, I'M GOIN' RIGHT NOW,
I HAVE TO GET THERE
BEFORE THE COPS...

19:53.230 --> 19:54.270
[GORDIE] STAY AWAY
FROM MY BOAT.

19:54.310 --> 19:55.650
REG IS LEAVIN', I THINK
HE'S HEADED FOR THE BOAT.

19:55.690 --> 19:57.030
OKAY, LISTEN TO ME.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.240
YOU GO HOME
AND WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT, ALL RIGHT?

19:59.280 --> 20:00.320
OKAY, OKAY.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.910
YOU WANNA GO TO WORK, OR WHAT?

20:02.610 --> 20:03.780
SEE YA LATER.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.080
MAN, HOW LONG
WE GOTTA STAY OUT HERE?

20:10.120 --> 20:11.370
AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.460
THERE HE IS.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S AFTER?

20:17.500 --> 20:18.300
YOU THINK HE'S LOOKIN'
FOR THE MONEY?

20:18.340 --> 20:20.260
OR COVERIN' UP HIS TRACKS.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.090
SO, IF GORDIE AND REG
DID THIS TOGETHER...

20:22.130 --> 20:23.840
THEY TAKE THE BODY,
THEY PUT IT IN THE BOAT,

20:23.890 --> 20:25.510
BRING IT OUT,
DUMP IT IN THE SEA.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.930
NOW HE'S CLEANIN' UP
THE EVIDENCE OF THE MURDER.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.980
LET'S GO HAVE A LOOK. QUIETLY.

20:36.650 --> 20:39.110
-&lt;WHISPERS&gt; ALL RIGHT,
STAY HERE, KEEP AN EYE.
-YEAH.

20:49.700 --> 20:50.700
WHAT?

20:54.330 --> 20:55.330
REG!

20:56.170 --> 20:58.250
REG! GET OFF THE BOAT!

20:58.300 --> 20:59.880
GET OFF THE BOAT!
RUN, DAD, RUN!

21:01.090 --> 21:02.090
GO!

21:08.760 --> 21:10.390
&lt;COUGHING&gt;

21:12.600 --> 21:14.390
&lt;ALL PANTING&gt;

21:18.610 --> 21:19.860
I TOLD YOU,
I WAS PART CO-OWNER...

21:19.900 --> 21:21.690
[MAL] COUPLE OF PROPANE TANKS
FUSED TOGETHER.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.320
A BOMB LIKE THAT
COULD HAVE BEEN
PLANTED BY ANYONE

21:23.360 --> 21:24.780
WITH A LITTLE KNOW-HOW.

21:24.820 --> 21:26.530
WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S NOT REG.

21:26.570 --> 21:29.410
UNLESS, YOU KNOW,
HE'S REALLY, REALLY BAD
AT TRYING TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

21:29.450 --> 21:32.540
HE CLAIMS HE WAS
LOOKIN' FOR THE MONEY
THAT PETE STOLE FROM HIM.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.330
SO IT WAS GORDIE,
DESTROYING EVIDENCE...

21:34.920 --> 21:35.960
OR GORDIE'S SON, ALEX.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.040
SO MAYBE IT WAS
GORDIE AND HIS SON,

21:38.090 --> 21:39.500
AND REG HERE IS IN THE CLEAR.

21:39.540 --> 21:40.710
[REG] LOOK, I TOLD YOU,
I DIDN'T DO IT!

21:40.750 --> 21:42.420
&lt;INDISTINCT CONVERSATION&gt;

21:44.050 --> 21:45.970
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

21:46.010 --> 21:47.180
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.

21:47.220 --> 21:48.260
BY THE WAY,
HE'S GOTTA BE PISSED

21:48.300 --> 21:49.640
ABOUT THE WHOLE BOAT
BLOWIN' UP.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.850
HE'S STILL A BUSINESS PARTNER.

21:50.890 --> 21:52.350
WE JUST GOTTA BE LOOKIN'
TWICE AS HARD

21:52.390 --> 21:53.520
FOR THE MISSING 50 GRAND.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.350
SO MAYBE
WE GOTTA FIND IT FIRST.

21:55.390 --> 21:57.560
WHY DON'T YOU SEND DES
OVER TO PETE'S PLACE

21:57.600 --> 22:00.360
AND IF HE STOLE THE MONEY,
AND I'M ONLY SAYING IF...

22:00.400 --> 22:02.070
HE'S GOTTA HAVE IT STASHED
SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

22:02.110 --> 22:03.610
COME ON, DAD.

22:03.650 --> 22:06.030
LET'S JUST DO IT TO PROVE THAT
PETE DIDN'T STEAL THE MONEY.

22:06.860 --> 22:07.860
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

22:10.080 --> 22:11.330
I ALMOST DIED...

22:11.700 --> 22:12.910
HEAVY STUFF.

22:12.950 --> 22:15.500
-WOULD THAT MAKE YOU SAD?
-I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.330
LOOK, I KNOW YOU LIKE
TO DO THINGS YOUR OWN WAY,

22:17.370 --> 22:20.540
BUT COULD YA NOT
GET YOURSELF KILLED DOIN' IT?

22:20.590 --> 22:22.460
IS THAT YOUR WAY
OF TRYIN' TO TELL ME
THAT YOU CARE?

22:22.500 --> 22:26.260
YOU CAN COME
TO YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS,
CAN'T YA?

22:30.350 --> 22:31.600
[JAKE] HOW WE MAKIN' OUT?

22:31.640 --> 22:33.770
REAL GOOD.
NOTHIN' WE CAN'T HANDLE.

22:33.810 --> 22:35.770
I'M DOING IT ALL
WITH DUE DILIGENCE, JAKE.

22:37.190 --> 22:40.110
I PROMISE I'LL TRY AND ENJOY
THIS WHOLE THING, ALL RIGHT?

22:40.150 --> 22:41.190
I'LL RELAX.

22:41.230 --> 22:42.980
THIS IS OUR DREAM.

22:44.150 --> 22:45.280
GOTTA TRUST ME, BROTHER.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.320
I DO TRUST YOU.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.900
MORNIN', JAKE.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.570
BIG FAT RONNIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

22:50.620 --> 22:52.080
IT'S NOTHIN', I GOT THIS.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.580
-WHAT?
-IT'S OKAY.

22:54.410 --> 22:55.700
OH, YOU DON'T...
YOU DON'T KNOW?

22:55.750 --> 22:57.000
YOU DON'T!

22:57.540 --> 22:58.710
WE'RE PARTNERS!

22:58.750 --> 23:01.250
-YEAH, HE DIDN'T TELL YA.
-RONNIE. &lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

23:03.130 --> 23:05.460
-&lt;CRASHES&gt;
-&lt;CROWD EXCLAIMS&gt;

23:05.510 --> 23:07.050
-HOW MUCH?
-OH, ENOUGH, BELIEVE ME.

23:07.090 --> 23:08.590
JAKE, IT'S HONEST...

23:08.630 --> 23:10.390
IT'S... IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.760
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HAD INVESTMENTS?

23:11.800 --> 23:14.640
WELL, THEY WERE HARDER
TO CASH IN THEN I THOUGHT,
ALL RIGHT?

23:14.680 --> 23:16.600
I NEED A WEEK OR TWO.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.980
IT'S GONNA BE FINE,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS.

23:18.020 --> 23:20.350
I'M SENSING
THIS IS A BAD TIME.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.440
-MAYBE WE COULD
CATCH UP LATER?
-GET OUT.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.610
YEAH.

23:24.650 --> 23:27.110
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
I BOUGHT INTO ALL YOUR CRAP.

23:27.150 --> 23:29.450
-JAKE...
-YOU'RE A PATHETIC IDIOT.

23:32.490 --> 23:34.620
NO, NO. SORRY.

23:34.660 --> 23:37.080
YOU'RE NOT AN IDIOT... I AM.

23:38.910 --> 23:41.290
WE'RE SELLIN' THE BAR AND
YOU'RE GONNA PAY RONNIE BACK.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.960
[KIM] YOU SHOULD BE SEARCHING
GORDIE'S HOUSE, NOT THIS ONE.

23:48.010 --> 23:51.010
IF ANYONE WAS STEALING MONEY
IT WAS ONE OF THE PITTMANS,
NOT MY DAD.

23:51.050 --> 23:52.590
WELL, I'M SURE
I WON'T FIND A THING.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.850
OKAY, START IN THE BASEMENT.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.220
AND IF YOU COULD
KEEP YOUR EYE OUT

23:55.260 --> 23:56.720
FOR A STERLING SILVER
PICTURE FRAME

23:56.770 --> 23:58.480
WITH LITTLE FLOWERS
AROUND THE EDGE

23:58.520 --> 23:59.890
WITH PICTURES OF MY PARENTS,

23:59.940 --> 24:01.600
-I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT
EVERYWHERE.
-WILL DO.

24:01.650 --> 24:03.980
AND, MY DAD'S WATCH
WITH AN ENGRAVING
"LOVE FROM KIM."

24:04.020 --> 24:05.690
-I GAVE IT TO HIM
LAST CHRISTMAS.
-OKAY.

24:05.730 --> 24:07.730
OTHER THINGS ARE MISSING, TOO,
MY DAD'S PERSONAL STUFF.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.650
SO IF YOU FIND ANYTHING
DOWN THERE, PLEASE...

24:09.690 --> 24:11.740
&lt;SOBBING&gt;

24:18.200 --> 24:19.660
SORRY.

24:19.700 --> 24:24.420
-UH... IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
-I JUST, I...

24:24.460 --> 24:27.340
I REALLY MISS HIM, YOU KNOW?
AND I SHOULD HAVE...

24:27.380 --> 24:28.920
TRIED HARDER
AND SEEN HIM MORE.

24:29.630 --> 24:30.920
YEAH.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.590
I DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE
TO SAY GOODBYE

24:32.630 --> 24:35.050
AND NOW I'M JUST...
I'M REALLY SAD

24:35.100 --> 24:38.520
AND I WISH THAT I HAD
THE CHANCE TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.640
BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.230
UH, NO. IT'S NOT...
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

24:42.270 --> 24:43.980
WELL, I MEAN... I MEAN, YEAH,

24:44.020 --> 24:45.810
YEAH, I MEAN, I GUESS IT IS...

24:45.860 --> 24:47.650
DEFINITELY TOO LATE, BUT...

24:50.610 --> 24:51.610
YEAH.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.700
RIGHT, WELL...
&lt;SNIFFLES&gt; UM...

24:56.070 --> 24:58.160
IF YOU FIND ANYTHING
DOWN THERE,

24:58.200 --> 24:59.950
YOU JUST LET ME KNOW. OKAY?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.120
OKAY.

25:02.910 --> 25:04.080
[JAKE] GORDIE!

25:04.120 --> 25:07.000
I SAID, KEEP YOUR VOICES DOWN.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.550
I DON'T WANT
MY FATHER WAKIN' UP.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.590
-WHERE IS HE?
-HE'S EXHAUSTED.

25:11.630 --> 25:13.720
THE POLICE JUST LEFT,
THEY'VE BEEN HERE
FOR OVER AN HOUR,

25:13.760 --> 25:14.840
GRILLIN' US, AGAIN.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.970
IT WAS VERY UPSETTING.

25:16.010 --> 25:17.640
WE JUST NEED A MINUTE,

25:17.680 --> 25:19.060
ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S
BOAT BLOWIN' UP.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.680
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT

25:20.720 --> 25:22.100
AND FRANKLY, THE TWO OF YOU

25:22.140 --> 25:23.940
HAVE GOT A LOT OF NERVE
COMIN' BACK HERE.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.600
LOOK, WE'RE SORRY.

25:25.650 --> 25:29.650
CAN WE JUST... CALM DOWN,
GO OVER THIS AGAIN.

25:29.690 --> 25:30.820
YEAH, LOOK, UH...

25:30.860 --> 25:32.190
WE ARE REALLY SORRY, OKAY?

25:32.240 --> 25:33.530
&lt;STUTTERS&gt; I'M ACTUALLY
GONNA STEP OUT,

25:33.570 --> 25:34.610
I'VE GOTTA MAKE A CALL.

25:34.650 --> 25:36.200
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU GUYS.

25:40.290 --> 25:42.660
LOOK, EVERYTHING IS
"POOR PETE" THIS
AND "POOR PETE" THAT.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.830
"OH, WHAT A TRAGEDY
IT IS ABOUT POOR PETE."

25:45.870 --> 25:47.750
I WANNA KNOW
WHAT ABOUT MY FATHER?

25:48.630 --> 25:50.090
I'M ALMOST GLAD PETE DIED.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.730
[JAKE] MISSING PROPANE TANKS.

26:14.110 --> 26:15.320
&lt;PHONE CAMERA CLICKS&gt;

26:38.010 --> 26:39.430
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

26:54.940 --> 26:57.820
THEY'VE GOT A STASH
OF WEAPONS IN THERE,
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

26:57.860 --> 26:59.780
HAD A HAND GRENADE,
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

26:59.820 --> 27:01.370
HAND GRENADE!

27:01.410 --> 27:03.280
PRETTY SOON WE'LL ALL
BE WEARIN' RIOT GEAR.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.450
IT'S NOT ALL THAT BAD.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.710
I WANNA HAVE
ANOTHER LOOK AROUND.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.750
YOU TAKE THESE TWO OUTSIDE?

27:08.790 --> 27:11.080
ROGER THAT.
COME ON! KEEP MOVIN'.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.960
SIR, WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' OUT HERE?

27:16.760 --> 27:17.840
THIS PLACE
NEEDS TO BE SECURED,

27:17.880 --> 27:19.010
I NEED YOU TO GO INSIDE.

27:21.430 --> 27:22.970
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU
PUT DOWN THAT GUN

27:23.010 --> 27:24.850
BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.

27:24.890 --> 27:25.680
OKAY?

27:25.720 --> 27:27.270
I DON'T WANNA SHOOT YA, KID,

27:27.310 --> 27:29.100
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANNA SHOOT ME.
SO LET'S JUST GO...

27:33.820 --> 27:36.230
TURN AROUND!
ON THE GROUND NOW!

27:36.280 --> 27:37.400
I SAID NOW!

27:39.860 --> 27:40.700
CUFF HIM!

27:42.870 --> 27:45.160
OFFICER DOWN,
WE GOT AN OFFICER DOWN.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.540
-BREATHE, BENNETT.
-&lt;BREATHING HEAVILY&gt;

27:46.580 --> 27:48.620
EYES ON ME. BENNETT?

27:48.660 --> 27:51.460
COME ON, PARTNER.
DON'T SCREW AROUND HERE.

27:52.790 --> 27:54.790
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
ALL RIGHT?

27:57.300 --> 27:59.550
[ALLISON] AND WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU SEE, MR. DOYLE?

27:59.590 --> 28:01.890
I SAW THE, UH... THE UH...

28:03.640 --> 28:05.180
THE... THE BUDDY-BUDDY.

28:05.220 --> 28:06.640
DEFENDANT.

28:07.140 --> 28:08.890
THE DEFENDANT.

28:08.930 --> 28:12.440
HE WENT OVER
AND HE LOOKED
AT THE OTHER... BUDDY.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.730
JAKE, YOU'RE NOT EVEN
PAYING ATTENTION, OR TRYING,
FOR THAT MATTER.

28:15.770 --> 28:18.190
I... LOOK, I PROMISE
I'LL GET IT RIGHT ON THE DAY,
ALL RIGHT?

28:18.230 --> 28:19.490
THE OTHER BUDDY WENT OVER
TO THE OTHER BUDDY

28:19.530 --> 28:21.780
AND HE CRACKED HIM IN THE HEAD
WITH THE TIRE IRON. SIMPLE.

28:22.410 --> 28:23.450
I HAVE AN IDEA.

28:24.910 --> 28:26.580
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

28:26.620 --> 28:29.250
FOR EVERY ANSWER
THAT YOU GET RIGHT,

28:29.290 --> 28:30.790
I'LL TAKE OFF
A PIECE OF CLOTHING.

28:30.830 --> 28:32.870
BUT FOR EVERY ONE
THAT YOU GET WRONG...

28:33.880 --> 28:35.630
I THINK THAT IS
AN EXCELLENT...

28:36.880 --> 28:38.050
AN EXCELLENT IDEA.

28:38.090 --> 28:41.300
SO, JUST TO SHOW YOU
THAT I MEAN BUSINESS...

28:45.890 --> 28:47.430
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

28:50.350 --> 28:52.230
NOW, WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU SEE, MR. DOYLE?

28:52.270 --> 28:54.230
I SAW THE DEFENDANT
APPROACH THE VICTIM

28:54.270 --> 28:56.730
AND, UH, STRIKE HIM REPEATEDLY
WITH A TIRE IRON.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.780
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; GOOD.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.150
DO YOU DO THIS
WITH ALL OF YOUR WITNESSES?

29:01.190 --> 29:03.860
-NO, WRONG.
-NO, NO, NO, NOW, NO.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.620
NOW, NOW DON'T GO
PUTTIN' STUFF BACK ON.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.240
&lt;CELL PHONE CHIMING&gt;

29:11.830 --> 29:13.790
-GO ON.
-&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt; THEN,

29:14.250 --> 29:15.630
I APPROACHED THE VICTIM,

29:15.670 --> 29:17.920
OBVIOUSLY, TO SEE
IF, UH, HE NEEDED HELP.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.090
-AND...
-AND...

29:23.630 --> 29:25.180
HE DID.

29:25.220 --> 29:28.890
CALLED EMERGENCY RESPONSE
AND GAVE THEM MY, UH...

29:30.180 --> 29:32.350
-STATEMENT.
-GOOD BOY.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.410
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

29:50.830 --> 29:52.000
WHY DON'T YOU GET THAT?

29:56.250 --> 29:57.790
YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY THE...

30:02.840 --> 30:06.970
THIS IS SO NOT
A VERY, VERY GOOD TIME.

30:07.010 --> 30:07.800
[LESLIE] &lt;SIGHS&gt; JAKE,

30:08.800 --> 30:09.800
I'M UH...

30:10.970 --> 30:12.640
I'M THE IN HOSPITAL.
I'VE BEEN SHOT.

30:13.430 --> 30:14.430
WHAT?

30:15.520 --> 30:16.560
UM...

30:17.980 --> 30:19.400
&lt;STAMMERING&gt; YOU'VE BEEN...
ARE YOU OKAY?

30:19.440 --> 30:22.030
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M JUST GONNA,
I'LL COME TO YOU RIGHT NOW.
OKAY?

30:22.070 --> 30:23.150
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME.

30:23.190 --> 30:25.570
-I'M FINE. JUST... -LESLIE,

30:25.610 --> 30:28.070
I WILL BE THERE IN 30 SECONDS,
YOU JUST...

30:28.110 --> 30:30.030
YOU JUST STAY THERE,
STAY CALM AND YOU RELAX, OKAY?

30:30.070 --> 30:31.080
I PROMISE I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.380
&lt;DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES&gt;

30:53.220 --> 30:54.930
-[JAKE] WHAT HAPPENED?
-&lt;SIGHS&gt;

30:54.970 --> 30:56.350
I TOLD YOU NOT TO COME.

30:56.390 --> 30:57.850
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.850
IT WAS A KID.
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.110
WHAT DID THE DOCTORS SAY?

31:01.150 --> 31:03.980
I'M LUCKY, YOU KNOW?

31:04.030 --> 31:06.320
WENT RIGHT THROUGH ME,
DIDN'T HIT ANYTHING MAJOR.

31:07.780 --> 31:08.860
SO YOU'RE OKAY?

31:12.580 --> 31:13.950
OH, MY GOD, LESLIE.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.330
YOU SHOULD SEE
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

31:17.370 --> 31:18.670
HOW DO I LOOK?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.120
REALLY SCARED.

31:21.790 --> 31:23.960
WELL, I AM. I MEAN, I WAS...

31:24.420 --> 31:25.630
I AM.

31:27.090 --> 31:28.380
HI.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.470
YEAH.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.930
WELL, I SHOULD
LEAVE YOU TO IT.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.770
I'LL SEE YA.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.940
-&lt;CELL PHONE CHIMES&gt;
-HEY, HEY.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.080
YOU KILLED HIM!

31:57.120 --> 31:58.580
JUST CALM DOWN!

31:59.750 --> 32:01.710
YOU KILLED MY FATHER!

32:01.750 --> 32:04.040
-WHAT THE HELL?
-HOW DARE YOU!

32:04.090 --> 32:05.920
UH, I DIDN'T FIND THE CASH,
BUT I FOUND THIS.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.210
-WHAT'S THIS?
-&lt;CLATTERING&gt;

32:07.260 --> 32:09.300
IT'S A... IT'S A POLICY,
IT'S A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY.

32:09.340 --> 32:11.970
-STOP IT!
YOU'VE GOT THIS ALL WRONG!
-YOU KILLED HIM!

32:13.470 --> 32:15.850
-PETE MADE LISA
THE BENEFICIARY.
-&lt;GLASS SHATTERS&gt;

32:15.890 --> 32:18.430
-WHY?
-SHE'S ABOUT TO GET
TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.690
-&lt;CLATTERS&gt;
-&lt;GLASS SHATTERS&gt;

32:21.730 --> 32:22.980
&lt;PANTS&gt;

32:26.230 --> 32:28.110
[LISA] I WAS SHOCKED,

32:28.150 --> 32:29.650
I HAD NO IDEA THAT I WAS...

32:30.320 --> 32:32.660
THAT HE HAD DONE THIS. &lt;SIGHS&gt;

32:32.700 --> 32:36.030
WHAT EXACTLY
WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH PETE, EXACTLY?

32:36.080 --> 32:37.160
&lt;LISA&gt; WELL, THAT'S JUST IT.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.040
I MEAN, WE WERE FRIENDS,
I THINK.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.870
HE LIKED MY WORK,
I PAINTED HIS PORTRAIT.

32:41.910 --> 32:43.880
YOU KNOW, WE TALKED.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.000
NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE LYING.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.380
THIS POLICY IS ONLY
A COUPLE MONTHS OLD.

32:49.420 --> 32:52.010
WHY WOULD HE MAKE YOU
THE BENEFICIARY
INSTEAD OF HIS OWN DAUGHTER?

32:52.050 --> 32:54.220
TRUST ME,
I'M AS SURPRISED AS ANYONE.

32:54.260 --> 32:57.310
&lt;IMITATES BUZZER&gt; LYING AGAIN.

32:57.350 --> 32:59.930
ARE YOU SURE
THERE WASN'T A LITTLE MORE
TO YOUR "FRIENDSHIP?"

32:59.970 --> 33:04.020
DON'T BE CRUDE.
THIS WHOLE THING IS... CRAZY.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.570
YOU KNOW, FOR A FRIEND,

33:11.610 --> 33:14.110
YOU SURE DO HAVE
A LOT OF PHOTOS
OF PETE LAYIN' AROUND.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.740
[LISA] I WORK FROM PHOTOS.
THAT'S HOW I START.

33:15.780 --> 33:18.580
IT'S MY PROCESS.
IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL.

33:18.620 --> 33:21.120
-IS THAT, UH...
-[LISA] ME, YES.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.160
I JUST FINISHED
A SELF-PORTRAIT.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.120
WELL, UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE
MARKET FOR SOME ARTWORK,

33:25.170 --> 33:27.420
GENTLEMEN, I'D SAY
THAT'S GOOD DAY.

33:27.460 --> 33:28.630
-YEAH.
-&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

33:29.300 --> 33:30.340
[MAL] THANK YOU.

33:35.090 --> 33:37.140
[KIM] THIS ALL MAKES SENSE
TO ME NOW.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.350
I'VE BEEN NOTICING
THINGS GOING MISSING
THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

33:39.390 --> 33:41.470
MY DAD'S BEST WATCH,
A SILVER PICTURE FRAME...

33:41.520 --> 33:43.560
SO YOU THINK
LISA'S STEALIN' THEM?

33:43.600 --> 33:45.440
I THINK THAT SHE'S A THIEF
AND A CON ARTIST

33:45.480 --> 33:47.520
WHO WEASELED MY DAD
INTO BUYING THAT POLICY

33:47.560 --> 33:48.820
AND THEN HAD HIM KILLED.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.150
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

33:50.190 --> 33:52.490
LISA'S CREDIT CARD BILL.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.820
[JAKE] WELL,
THERE'S A PURCHASE ON HERE
FROM LAST WEEK.

33:56.110 --> 33:59.410
$5,900 TO AN ONLINE
TRAVEL AGENCY.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.160
PLANNIN' HER GETAWAY.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.160
AT THAT PRICE? WOW.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.330
MUST BE FLYING FIRST CLASS.

34:05.370 --> 34:07.290
HOW LONG 'TILL THAT
INSURANCE CHECK COMES IN?

34:07.330 --> 34:09.250
UH, A COUPLE OF WEEKS, MAYBE.

34:09.290 --> 34:12.760
IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
IF LISA'S INVOLVED,
WE'LL FIND OUT, OKAY?

34:13.760 --> 34:15.340
AND, IF SHE DID DO IT,

34:18.050 --> 34:19.800
ONE OF THESE CRACKERS
WAS IN ON IT.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.280
WELL, HELLO, GORDIE.

34:40.070 --> 34:41.240
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

34:45.710 --> 34:47.830
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

34:55.840 --> 34:56.840
HUH.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.840
&lt;TELEPHONE RINGING&gt;

35:01.550 --> 35:02.720
[MAL] FIND ANYTHING?

35:02.760 --> 35:04.640
[JAKE] UH, YEAH.
I'M PRETTY SURE

35:04.680 --> 35:08.270
THAT LISA AND GORDIE,
WERE A BIT OF AN ITEM.

35:08.310 --> 35:09.690
AND I THINK
THEY KILLED PETE RYAN.

35:09.730 --> 35:12.320
SO SHE DUPES PETE INTO
BUYING THE INSURANCE POLICY.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.320
AND THEN SHE CONVINCES GORDIE
TO DUMP HIM OVER THE SIDE
OF THE BOAT.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.150
WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT THOSE AIRLINE TICKETS?

35:17.190 --> 35:19.070
UH, SHE'S HEADED
TO COSTA RICA.

35:19.110 --> 35:20.530
YEAH, AND HERE'S
A WEIRD THING.

35:20.570 --> 35:23.240
IT'S TWO TICKETS, NOT ONE,
DEPARTING FROM ICELAND.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.870
-NOT EXACTLY
THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE.
-[JAKE] ICELAND?

35:25.910 --> 35:26.950
FOR WHAT DATE?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.170
-SATURDAY.
-[JAKE] DAD,

35:29.210 --> 35:31.460
MEET ME AT LISA'S.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.340
SOMETHING TELLS ME
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

35:34.210 --> 35:35.880
-SEE YA.
-BYE.

35:41.260 --> 35:43.010
[MAL] ALWAYS LEAVE THE PACKING
'TILL THE LAST MINUTE, LISA?

35:53.400 --> 35:54.360
MAN, SHE CAN RUN.

35:55.230 --> 35:58.070
&lt;BOTH PANTING&gt;

35:58.110 --> 35:59.450
[MAL] THE PHOTO
THAT WAS MISSIN',
OF PETE AND HIS WIFE.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.450
SO YOU GET
AN INSURANCE CLAIM
FOR 2 MILLION DOLLARS,

36:05.490 --> 36:07.370
WHY WOULD YOU BOTHER
WITH PETTY THEFT?

36:07.410 --> 36:08.700
-YOU WOULDN'T.
-ALL RIGHT.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.420
THESE PILLS ARE PETE'S.

36:15.460 --> 36:17.460
-I THINK I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO PETE RYAN.
-LET'S GO.

36:18.630 --> 36:20.170
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

36:30.270 --> 36:32.350
MUST BE SAILING OUT OF HERE
TO ICELAND.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.980
[JAKE] WE HAVEN'T GOT
MUCH TIME, OBVIOUSLY.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.020
AND THERE'S GORDIE.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.190
LISA!

36:39.860 --> 36:41.700
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU KNOW
HOW TO HOTWIRE A BOAT?

36:41.740 --> 36:43.320
NO, I GOT A BETTER IDEA.
COME ON.

36:43.610 --> 36:45.200
WHAT?

36:45.240 --> 36:46.240
ARE YOU COMIN' OR NOT?

36:57.920 --> 36:59.210
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

37:03.630 --> 37:05.220
&lt;TIRES SCREECH&gt;

37:13.770 --> 37:14.940
[MAL] JAKE!

37:28.330 --> 37:30.620
[KIM] WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
WHICH ONE OF YOU
MURDERED MY DAD?

37:30.660 --> 37:32.710
KIM, WAIT A MINUTE.
I THINK YOU NEED TO
SEE THIS FOR YOURSELF.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.420
-THEY WERE GOING TO ICELAND.
-ICELAND?

37:34.460 --> 37:38.710
YEAH, BECAUSE SOMEONE
DIDN'T WANT TO SHOW HIS FACE
IN THE ST. JOHN'S AIRPORT.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.710
NO ONE ELSE IS TO BLAME,
IT'S ONLY ME.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.300
[MAN] A TRUE GENTLEMAN,
BUT IT'S ALL BULL CRAP.

37:43.340 --> 37:47.260
I'M THE ONE WHO THOUGHT
THE WHOLE THING UP,
STEM TO STERN.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.300
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

37:49.350 --> 37:50.970
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

37:51.020 --> 37:53.140
-MALACHY.
-PETE.

37:53.180 --> 37:54.270
OH, MY GOD, DADDY?

37:57.650 --> 38:00.820
I'M SORRY DARLIN',
THAT I PUT YOU THROUGH
ALL THIS.

38:00.860 --> 38:02.740
NOW LOOK, I HAD A PLAN
TO TELL YA, I PROMISE.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.200
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU PUT ME THROUGH?

38:04.240 --> 38:06.160
-I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!
-[PETE] YEAH, BUT I'M NOT.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.490
I COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY,

38:07.530 --> 38:08.660
THIS NEEDED TO BE
KEPT A SECRET.

38:10.530 --> 38:11.910
SO, THE INSURANCE CLAIM...

38:11.950 --> 38:13.410
BUT, THAT'S FRAUD!

38:13.450 --> 38:16.250
NAH, WE'RE JUST COLLECTING
WHAT'S OWED TO US, DARLING.

38:16.290 --> 38:17.380
[GORDIE]
THEY DIDN'T PAY A NICKEL,

38:17.420 --> 38:19.420
NOT A NICKEL ON MY BACK.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.460
YEAH, SO WE'RE COLLECTIN',
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.380
SO YOU FAKE PETE'S DEATH,

38:23.420 --> 38:24.760
YOU COLLECT
THE TWO MILLION BUCKS

38:24.800 --> 38:26.880
AND THEN YOU RETIRE
TO COSTA RICA. &lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt;

38:26.930 --> 38:28.430
THAT IS NOT A BAD PLAN.

38:28.470 --> 38:30.220
I'M JUST TIRED.

38:30.260 --> 38:31.600
YEAH, AND HIS BACK IS NOT FIT.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.520
I MEAN, THIS GUY DESERVES
TO HAVE A FEW BEERS
ON A BEACH.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.600
IT'S BETTER THAN SITTING
IN ME SON'S HOUSE
WAITING TO DIE.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.520
WE KEPT THE 50,000...

38:39.190 --> 38:40.440
TO GET US STARTED.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.530
AND MOST OF IT WE SPENT
ON RENTIN' THIS FRIGGIN' BOAT,

38:43.570 --> 38:45.400
SINCE THIS ONE BLEW UP OURS.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.570
&lt;BOTH CHUCKLE&gt;

38:47.610 --> 38:49.410
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT,
I HAVE TO TELL YA.

38:49.450 --> 38:52.330
YEAH, THE REST OF IT
WE GAVE TO A SKIPPER
OF A TROLLER OFFSHORE.

38:52.370 --> 38:54.870
THEY WERE GONNA TAKE US
THE REST OF THE WAY
TO ICELAND.

38:56.410 --> 38:58.500
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT DO YOU GET
OUT OF ALL THIS?

38:59.460 --> 39:00.460
THE ADVENTURE.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.880
[GORDIE] SO...

39:03.590 --> 39:04.800
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, COP?

39:06.800 --> 39:09.390
NO ONE'S DEAD
AND I'M NOT A COP.

39:09.430 --> 39:12.390
SO I THINK
WHAT HE MEANS IS... GO.

39:12.430 --> 39:13.970
SAFE JOURNEY.
SEND US A POSTCARD.

39:14.010 --> 39:15.600
YEAH, WILL DO.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.520
BUT GIVE US A FEW WEEKS
AND WE'LL MAKE CONTACT.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.440
LOOK, YOU CHECK YOUR SPAM
FOR A NEW EMAIL ADDRESS, HUH.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.610
BYE, SWEETHEART.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.280
GOOD LUCK.

39:56.350 --> 39:57.350
BYE!

40:11.990 --> 40:14.410
-HI.
-[LESLIE] HEY YOU.

40:15.370 --> 40:16.580
ARE YOU ALONE?

40:17.750 --> 40:18.750
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

40:19.540 --> 40:21.040
YEAH.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.540
I'VE BEEN...
THINKIN' ABOUT YOU.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.210
OH, YEAH?

40:25.250 --> 40:28.670
