WEBVTT

01:11.375 --> 01:15.041
It's a great place, a beautiful place.
Why you putting up with that?

01:16.083 --> 01:17.250
I don't know.

01:17.333 --> 01:19.875
I'm not sure I wanna go back
to where I was last year.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.416
NETFLIX PRESENTS

02:51.583 --> 02:54.166
You need to empty the trash.
It's overflowing.

02:54.666 --> 02:57.166
I'll take out the trash later.

03:02.708 --> 03:05.375
Are you washing the dishes, Dad?
Leave it. I'll do it later.

03:05.458 --> 03:06.875
You'll do them? What will you do?

03:09.708 --> 03:10.791
Look at how you live.

03:10.875 --> 03:13.208
-This place is-- it-- it's become a--
-A pigsty.

03:13.291 --> 03:16.125
An amusement park attraction
and a pigsty too.

03:16.208 --> 03:20.416
What are all these colors for,
all these little comics, all this stuff?

03:20.500 --> 03:23.125
Every time I come here, I get depressed.

03:23.208 --> 03:25.208
"Your grandmother
kept the apartment spotless."

03:25.291 --> 03:28.083
"You don't work. You don't study."
You haven't said a thing all night.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.083
But congratulations. Now you've said it.

03:30.166 --> 03:33.708
You think you're fucking with me,
but you're only hurting yourself.

03:33.791 --> 03:36.250
You took five exams in two years,
and you call that studying?

03:36.333 --> 03:38.208
Come on, keep going. Make me feel guilty.

03:38.291 --> 03:41.750
Ah, now it's me making you feel guilty?
Now I get it.

03:41.833 --> 03:45.583
Could it be that you're the one making me
say the same things all the time, huh?

03:45.666 --> 03:48.291
I'm trying, Dad.

03:50.333 --> 03:55.125
Why is the shelf still like this?
Are you waiting for me to fix it?

03:55.208 --> 03:58.333
Like the other hideous thing,
that electric palm over there.

04:02.625 --> 04:04.000
What's going on in your head?

04:04.083 --> 04:07.750
What are you thinking?
If there's anything I can do…

04:08.333 --> 04:09.958
Look, I know it's hard.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.583
I know. I understand you.
I used to be just like you.

04:13.666 --> 04:15.750
If it weren't for your grandfather.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.583
Do you really think I cared
about making wine

04:18.666 --> 04:20.666
when the Siena wanted me
for their youth team?

04:21.708 --> 04:24.541
What was I supposed to do,
abandon our family traditions?

04:25.083 --> 04:27.375
And maybe I didn't have much faith
in myself.

04:27.458 --> 04:31.000
Ludovico. Ludovico!

04:31.083 --> 04:33.333
-Yeah.
-Are you even listening to me?

04:33.416 --> 04:34.250
Yes, Dad.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.708
If I bust your balls,
it's because I care about you.

04:36.791 --> 04:37.708
I know.

04:41.250 --> 04:44.000
Okay, I'm going.
Oh, I left your medicine here.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.833
Oh, that's right. What was
that thing you wanted to show me?

04:50.541 --> 04:52.916
Oh, forget it, Dad.
I'll show it to you next time.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.166
Look, I'm gonna give you the money
in a couple of weeks.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.750
-I have to pay the farmworkers first.
-Don't worry about it.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.541
We've started making oil.

04:59.625 --> 05:02.458
We're still experimenting
since it's our first year.

05:02.541 --> 05:06.458
Why don't you come over?
Stay a couple of days.

05:06.541 --> 05:09.458
I'll explain things to you.
We can be together a bit.

05:09.541 --> 05:13.166
-Your mom will be happy.
-Oh, for sure. It's a good idea.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.166
Bye.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.416
-Good evening.
-Hi.

05:45.375 --> 05:46.458
Maybe next time.

06:03.583 --> 06:04.916
Hi, Secco.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.291
Hey, you're looking great.
You look like Platinette.

06:13.375 --> 06:16.500
I was saving my daily "fuck off"
for my wife, but you can have it.

06:16.583 --> 06:18.083
Come on, gimme a drink.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.208
-Is he here?
-Yeah.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.083
Can you tell him?

06:39.708 --> 06:41.166
Mario just got here.

06:43.083 --> 06:46.375
Gimme another, Secco.

07:00.625 --> 07:05.000
All right, then. I'm going for a piss.
My prostate is driving me crazy.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.083
Hey, careful with this, okay?
Don't take your eyes off it for--

07:08.166 --> 07:09.875
Hey!

07:12.291 --> 07:13.166
Shit!

07:15.833 --> 07:17.333
Asshole, stop!

09:18.291 --> 09:20.666
Shh! Quiet, quiet, quiet.

09:20.750 --> 09:24.333
Walk, quiet. Easy, walk.
Let's go to your place.

09:24.416 --> 09:26.958
Where do you live?
Where the fuck do you live?

09:27.041 --> 09:29.666
Where the fuck do you live?
Take me to your place, quick, fast.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.708
Move.

09:31.791 --> 09:33.791
-Do you live alone? Huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.458
-Do you live alone?
-Yes.

09:35.541 --> 09:38.083
-Come on, open up. Open up.
-Yeah.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.208
Where the fuck do you live?
Which one is it?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.041
Fuck. It… it's this one.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.375
Open. Come on, open.

09:49.375 --> 09:53.416
Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on, fuck.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.291
-Gimme the keys.
-Yeah, yeah.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.333
Shh, quiet.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.625
And also your phone. Your phone.

10:08.666 --> 10:10.125
-You said you live on your own?
-Huh?

10:10.208 --> 10:11.375
-Do you live on your own?
-Yes.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.416
-Yeah? Get in here.
-Yeah.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.250
All right. Hey. What's wrong?

10:19.333 --> 10:23.000
-Huh? What's wrong? What's wrong?
-Hang on.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.958
Sit down.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.416
Fuck. Hey, talk. Fuck, what is it?

10:28.500 --> 10:30.208
-Panic attack.
-What can I do?

10:30.291 --> 10:32.083
My drops. The bag.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.875
-This one? Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah.

10:34.958 --> 10:36.083
Which one?

10:37.416 --> 10:40.708
How the fuck does it open? How many?

10:41.375 --> 10:43.083
-Ten.
-Let's make it 15.

10:47.708 --> 10:51.708
Fuck.

10:55.041 --> 10:55.875
Ah.

11:03.541 --> 11:04.833
Aw, fuck.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.041
Sit down. Hey, sit down.

11:38.708 --> 11:40.416
Picchio, it's me. Listen up.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.083
I don't give a fuck what time it is.

11:43.166 --> 11:45.500
I need you to send me 20 kids right now.

11:45.583 --> 11:48.625
I need a watchman day and night
outside the condominiums.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.291
They need to work in shifts. I said now!

12:00.916 --> 12:05.208
Ludovico Fazi, is it you?

12:05.291 --> 12:07.125
You can call me Jack.

12:07.916 --> 12:10.166
I'm gonna have to stay here for a while.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.750
They're looking for me.

12:13.958 --> 12:15.041
They know what I look like.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.666
They know I'm in the area,
but I'll find a way to get out, okay?

12:20.083 --> 12:23.291
If you act up,
I'll have to kill you.

12:23.875 --> 12:27.541
However, if you play along, I'll give you
a nice gift for the trouble when I go.

12:27.625 --> 12:28.791
A gift?

12:28.875 --> 12:30.625
Do you hear me when I talk to you?

12:30.708 --> 12:33.333
Listen closely
because I will not repeat myself.

12:33.416 --> 12:36.833
You stay here, nice and quiet.
Forget about the rest of the world.

12:36.916 --> 12:39.750
And when I go, you'll get 5,000 euros.

12:42.041 --> 12:43.166
Cash.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.458
Five thousand?

12:44.541 --> 12:45.750
What did I fucking tell you?

12:49.583 --> 12:50.958
You'll get it when I leave.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.000
You have to earn it though.

12:57.583 --> 13:00.666
So we have a deal.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.000
Hey.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.500
Mind your own fucking business.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.375
-Understood?
-Yeah.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.250
Fucking spies.

13:35.833 --> 13:38.375
I should have been
on the other side of the world by now.

13:45.208 --> 13:46.583
I'm going to sleep now.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.625
It's been a bad night. I'm beat.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.250
Get up!

13:56.375 --> 13:57.458
Now get in there.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.416
Come on.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.041
Didn't we agree on 5,000?

14:03.125 --> 14:05.791
You're gonna spend the night in here.
Where's the key?

14:21.083 --> 14:22.750
He knew about the cameras.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.000
He just didn't care.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.000
And he knew Mario
was carrying a lot of money tonight.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.041
That means he was planning to steal it,

14:34.125 --> 14:37.708
and he was probably hoping
to vanish right after the theft.

14:45.416 --> 14:47.666
"It doesn't matter who you really are."

14:47.750 --> 14:50.875
"What matters is
what other people think you are."

15:08.125 --> 15:12.083
Let's have a little chat
with the genius downstairs.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.125
Bye, Caino.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.750
Right, Mario, let me get this straight.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.333
You put your bag here on the stool.

16:11.416 --> 16:13.375
You got up to go to the bathroom.

16:13.458 --> 16:16.083
The guy pushed you,
grabbed the bag and took off.

16:16.166 --> 16:18.625
Yeah, but I almost caught him.
I swear, Caino.

16:18.708 --> 16:21.541
He fell off his bike
and started running like a madman.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.500
I was right behind him on my bike,
but then--

16:23.583 --> 16:25.125
Then you let him get away.

16:25.208 --> 16:28.083
Mind you,
I wasn't asking for a justification.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.166
I was asking for an explanation.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.541
I'm sorry, Caino.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.125
But I know where he is.

16:34.208 --> 16:36.708
He went into the apartment buildings,
the ones near the market.

16:36.791 --> 16:38.041
His days are numbered. Trust me.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.208
He's hiding in one of the apartments.
That's for sure.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.791
Yeah, you see?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.875
He dropped this.

16:47.541 --> 16:49.625
Here. It's your money.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.083
Hmm.

16:52.916 --> 16:55.375
I got 20 kids down there right now.

16:55.958 --> 16:57.625
They're checking everyone
going in and out.

16:57.708 --> 17:00.458
As soon as this son of a bitch
sticks his nose out, I'm gonna get him.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.041
How are you gonna find him?
Did you see his face?

17:16.625 --> 17:19.291
Do you know what's
the most important thing for a man?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.375
It's their reputation.

17:25.541 --> 17:27.000
It doesn't matter who you really are.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.125
What matters is
what other people think you are.

17:29.208 --> 17:32.458
Your reputation is your destiny,
like your character.

17:32.541 --> 17:35.125
Everyone knows that whoever steals
from me is a dead man.

17:35.666 --> 17:37.875
This is the reputation
I've built for myself,

17:37.958 --> 17:39.875
and I can't have it destroyed
by some random guy.

17:39.958 --> 17:41.375
You understand, yeah?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
-Yeah.
-Of course you understand.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.958
You've been working for me for many years.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.333
Do you believe in destiny, Mario?

17:55.500 --> 17:56.708
Yeah, I do.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.250
Then play.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.250
Discover your destiny.

18:37.791 --> 18:40.250
What drives people to gamble?

18:42.875 --> 18:45.541
Is it greed? Poverty?

18:46.291 --> 18:47.583
Loneliness?

18:48.958 --> 18:51.666
Or is it human nature?

18:54.250 --> 18:57.125
The more you lose,
the more you wanna get it back.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.958
And that's all there is to it.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.625
Don't you agree, Mario?

19:26.333 --> 19:27.750
I won!

19:27.833 --> 19:29.000
I won, Caino!

19:29.083 --> 19:31.583
You see? Destiny's on my side!

19:36.541 --> 19:37.666
Yeah.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.958
But you were the one
who believed in destiny, not me.

19:54.416 --> 19:55.458
I'll get him.

19:56.791 --> 19:58.458
Stinking son of a fucking bitch.

19:58.541 --> 20:00.958
Spartaco, watch your language.

20:02.916 --> 20:06.083
I want him here alive. Twenty-four hours.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.000
Or you'd better disappear too.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.958
Take him away and clean up this mess.

20:20.375 --> 20:24.000
Fucking hell! I can't believe he blew
his brains out without batting an eye.

20:24.708 --> 20:26.500
Who? You mean Buzzetti?

20:26.583 --> 20:27.750
Who else?

20:27.833 --> 20:29.625
He's a hit man. He just follows orders.

20:29.708 --> 20:31.375
The real killer is Caino.

20:31.458 --> 20:35.250
Well, for someone who killed
his own brother just for money,

20:35.333 --> 20:37.083
even if no one could prove he did it.

20:37.166 --> 20:40.500
Don't forget the four or five
other deaths he credits himself with.

20:41.833 --> 20:44.708
I hate him. Just hate him.

20:44.791 --> 20:46.458
He thinks he's a fucking god.

20:47.041 --> 20:50.416
When he talks to me,
it's like he's talking to a cockroach.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.291
I understand that, but Mario as well?

20:52.375 --> 20:53.625
Hey, what about Mario?

20:55.208 --> 20:58.000
Don't you say a bad word about Mario.
I've known him since I was 20.

21:00.958 --> 21:02.458
Then what are you saying?

21:02.541 --> 21:06.375
If someone steals my car
and you can't catch the thief,

21:07.250 --> 21:09.333
it's okay for me to kill you?

21:09.416 --> 21:11.500
Caino can't suffer anyone
to be smarter than he is.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.791
Everyone knows that.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.791
He's got an inferiority complex.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.583
Where did you read that, Marzio?

21:18.333 --> 21:20.416
And then who the fuck is he?
Who does he think he is?

21:20.500 --> 21:21.541
Napoleon?

21:22.125 --> 21:25.041
He's a loan shark
who hides behind some betting shop

21:25.125 --> 21:27.208
full of old women and junkies,

21:27.291 --> 21:29.500
bars and restaurants outside of town.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.958
-But he's rolling in it.
-Yeah, so fucking what?

21:32.041 --> 21:35.041
He wears a suit and cologne,
but he's still a fucking beggar.

21:35.125 --> 21:36.291
A guy who fixed fights.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.833
Shitty little megalomaniac.

21:39.916 --> 21:41.916
Mario had three children

21:42.000 --> 21:43.666
and a wife, a total babe by the way.

21:43.750 --> 21:46.500
-Caino had him killed like a dog.
-You know what I heard?

21:46.583 --> 21:50.000
That Caino's been fucking
Mario's wife for a while now.

21:53.125 --> 21:56.708
-What are you talking about? Giulia?
-Yeah. I swear.

21:56.791 --> 21:59.041
And I think
he already wanted him dead for that.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.666
This is just an excuse.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.666
No, no. That's impossible.

22:03.750 --> 22:06.291
You don't touch a friend's woman.
That's just how it is.

22:06.375 --> 22:08.750
And trust me,
Giulia doesn't fuck around either.

22:08.833 --> 22:12.041
I can promise you that.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.500
I hit on her loads of times,
but she never put out.

22:15.583 --> 22:18.375
-She did with Caino though.
-Fill this hole in and shut the fuck up!

22:19.041 --> 22:20.833
-Picchio.
-Oh, it's just Picchio.

22:20.916 --> 22:22.291
Nobody showed up, huh?

22:22.375 --> 22:23.625
Keep your eyes peeled.

22:23.708 --> 22:26.375
Can you take a photo of this guy
with your phone and send it to Picchio?

22:26.458 --> 22:29.041
-Sure. I can do it.
-Good boy.

22:32.625 --> 22:34.375
You can rest easy now, Mario.

22:36.291 --> 22:37.791
Rest in peace, friend.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.583
-That's why they pay so much.
-To hell with 'em.

23:25.666 --> 23:29.208
The administrator is raking it in too,
but he's not risking shit.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.750
He's a bit of a schemer.
You get it?

23:31.833 --> 23:35.083
And if you fall,
they say you should have been careful.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.375
Like Stelvio's cousin. Poor guy.
You remember?

23:39.458 --> 23:42.541
-Ah, of course I do. Yeah.
-May he rest in peace.

24:39.833 --> 24:41.333
Are you wearing one of my shirts?

24:41.416 --> 24:44.291
Yeah, I've also had a shower and a shave.
Do you want a coffee?

24:44.875 --> 24:46.875
-So you used my things?
-Don't be a pain.

24:46.958 --> 24:50.083
My clothes stank of garbage.
When they dry, I'll give yours back.

24:50.166 --> 24:51.916
Do you want a coffee?

24:58.500 --> 25:00.541
Why are you using
my grandmother's antique china cups?

25:00.625 --> 25:01.833
Because these are cups.

25:01.916 --> 25:04.250
You fill them up,
and then you drink from them.

25:06.916 --> 25:08.666
If you want some, come and get it.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Your grandma?

25:29.125 --> 25:31.375
What was she, a singer, a musician?

25:31.458 --> 25:32.791
No, she gave piano lessons.

25:33.750 --> 25:36.375
-Did you put this up?
-Mm-hmm.

25:39.750 --> 25:42.833
-It's broken. It doesn't work.
-"It's broken. It doesn't work."

25:42.916 --> 25:44.333
Is it that difficult to fix?

25:48.458 --> 25:50.875
Here. Wash this one too.

25:58.583 --> 26:00.500
What about these big books?
Were you at school?

26:00.583 --> 26:04.041
What's with the interrogation?
What do you think you are, a cop?

26:07.083 --> 26:08.458
I asked you a question.

26:14.208 --> 26:16.708
-I'm studying economics.
-Haven't taken many exams I bet.

26:17.416 --> 26:21.000
It takes five minutes to figure you out
and write your story from birth to now.

26:22.625 --> 26:23.958
Such a sad story.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.083
Okay, that's enough!

26:26.166 --> 26:28.083
I was just making small talk.

26:28.875 --> 26:32.250
All these movies, comics, unopened
textbooks. What am I supposed to think?

26:32.333 --> 26:34.416
I study the comics. I draw.

26:35.916 --> 26:37.958
-What do you draw?
-I draw my own comics.

26:38.625 --> 26:41.541
-The only thing I've ever been good at.
-I can picture you.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.416
Sitting there
with the light from the lamp, alone.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.041
Always alone. Zero friends.

26:47.125 --> 26:48.875
Do you have a girlfriend at least?

26:51.125 --> 26:53.041
-Of course not.
-Look, I've had two girlfriends.

26:53.125 --> 26:54.916
-A player!
-A thief and a psychologist.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.125
Don't get uppity
or I'll rip your head off.

26:57.708 --> 27:00.375
I don't give a fuck
how you ended up the way you are.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.875
It's probably not your fault,
but it's not mine either.

27:03.958 --> 27:04.958
We clear?

27:12.166 --> 27:13.666
I have a serious illness.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.791
What do you mean? You're sick?

27:24.791 --> 27:25.708
How long?

27:26.666 --> 27:27.583
It's been a year.

27:27.666 --> 27:30.041
Is that what the hat's for?
You're doing chemo?

27:30.666 --> 27:31.750
Chemo?

27:31.833 --> 27:32.750
Yeah.

27:33.333 --> 27:36.125
You do know depression
isn't treated with chemo, right?

27:36.208 --> 27:38.083
-Depression? Fuck off.
-Gimme my hat back!

27:38.166 --> 27:40.333
Take this thing off.
It's not like you're bald.

27:40.416 --> 27:41.833
What do you know about depression?

27:41.916 --> 27:44.416
You stuff yourself with that
bullshit medication in the bathroom

27:44.500 --> 27:47.416
to convince yourself you're sick
and hide like a rat. And you know why?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.416
Because you hate yourself.

27:51.291 --> 27:53.416
You don't need a degree
to understand that.

28:09.250 --> 28:12.208
Listen, the guy who lives across the way,
what does he do, odd jobs?

28:12.291 --> 28:14.708
I saw that he has
cans of paint outside his door.

28:16.458 --> 28:19.708
No, the concierge told me
his wife wanted a new kitchen.

28:19.791 --> 28:22.083
He has a bar. He's a borderline alcoholic.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.250
Would you happen to have
an X-ray in your apartment?

28:24.333 --> 28:25.625
-An X-ray of his wife?
-Yours.

28:25.708 --> 28:28.208
You said you were sick.
Did a doctor give you an X-ray?

28:28.291 --> 28:30.583
-Yes, I have an X-ray.
-Okay. Listen then.

28:32.041 --> 28:34.208
Let's do this.
Since there's nothing to eat here,

28:34.291 --> 28:37.083
you're gonna grab the X-ray,
go over there, open the door.

28:37.166 --> 28:38.916
It's not a security door.
It should be easy.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.875
You go in,
empty the fridge and come back here.

28:40.958 --> 28:42.458
You must be crazy. I'm not a thief.

28:42.541 --> 28:44.916
-I've never done it.
-A little adrenaline won't hurt, right?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.875
No, no, no, no, no. No way. First,
his wife is definitely gonna be home.

28:47.958 --> 28:50.125
-You ring first to see if she's there.
-Oh, yeah, sure.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.500
And what if she opens the door?

28:51.583 --> 28:54.958
-Ask her for some salt.
-And what am I gonna do with the salt?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Go, come on, go.

29:15.541 --> 29:19.125
The X-ray.
Put it under the lock and pull it up. Up.

29:26.291 --> 29:29.541
-Don't walk away from me, bitch…
-Come on.

29:29.625 --> 29:32.166
Are you seeing someone else?
You can't do this to me.

29:32.250 --> 29:35.000
Again, Filippo?
I'm not seeing anyone else. Stop it.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.291
Open the door, Jack.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.625
I hope I find someone normal soon.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.458
Someone normal, huh?

29:41.541 --> 29:43.333
I'll make you regret it,
you and that asshole.

29:43.416 --> 29:46.125
Don't you dare threaten me
or I'll call the police. You understand?

29:46.208 --> 29:49.125
Get off of me. Filippo, get off of me!
I'll scream! You're hurting me!

29:49.208 --> 29:51.625
Hey, Rebecca! Are you okay?

29:51.708 --> 29:54.458
Yes. I'm okay.

29:57.375 --> 29:58.875
What are you looking at? Little shit.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.541
If you see anyone else, I'll destroy you.

30:04.166 --> 30:08.041
Do you realize?
Two years wasted with that asshole!

30:08.916 --> 30:11.041
Please excuse him. He's the little shit.

30:33.000 --> 30:33.875
Stand up.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.041
Stand up straight.

30:38.416 --> 30:39.458
Hit here, come on.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.000
Come on.

30:42.083 --> 30:44.333
What's this? Come on. Harder.

30:44.416 --> 30:45.666
Again. Go!

30:45.750 --> 30:48.166
Go again. Harder, don't stop. Hit.

30:48.250 --> 30:51.583
Go, go, hit! Harder!
Use the other one too!

30:51.666 --> 30:53.625
Come on, get it out! Get it out, huh?

30:53.708 --> 30:57.625
Way to go! Enough, enough, enough.
Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough.

30:57.708 --> 30:59.750
Shh!

30:59.833 --> 31:02.791
Shh! Good. Yeah?

31:03.750 --> 31:06.458
Oh, you have a good right hook, you know?

31:06.541 --> 31:09.375
Next time you see him,
plant your fist in that fucker's face.

31:10.083 --> 31:11.666
Now relax. Follow my lead.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.125
Better? Hmm?

31:17.916 --> 31:20.333
Now we're gonna go
to the neighbor's together, okay?

31:21.125 --> 31:21.958
Yeah.

31:40.041 --> 31:41.666
Be quiet. Shh!

32:10.958 --> 32:11.791
Come on.

32:28.375 --> 32:30.083
Shh!

32:32.416 --> 32:34.875
Oh, hi. Hi, my love.

32:35.583 --> 32:36.541
Oh, babe.

32:37.708 --> 32:41.041
I'm alone.
My husband is out until tonight.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.750
So we have
the whole afternoon to ourselves.

32:43.833 --> 32:46.166
What are we playing today?

32:46.250 --> 32:48.375
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

32:49.625 --> 32:53.125
Mm, no, no, no, no.
Come on, we did that last time.

32:54.791 --> 32:56.041
Mmm.

32:56.125 --> 32:59.291
You know that.
I will always say yes to you anyway.

32:59.375 --> 33:01.375
Why do you want me to go to the kitchen?

33:02.833 --> 33:05.291
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

33:07.958 --> 33:09.333
Mmm.

33:09.958 --> 33:11.416
Ice cubes.

33:12.833 --> 33:14.875
Mmm. I think I know.

33:18.458 --> 33:20.000
Yes, sir.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.000
I got the ice.

33:22.833 --> 33:24.541
You know what you are?

33:24.625 --> 33:28.916
You're such a dirty, tiny, little animal
who grunts for me.

33:29.666 --> 33:33.041
Yes. Guess which one.

33:33.125 --> 33:35.458
A pig!

33:35.541 --> 33:39.750
Ah, yes! Yes.

33:39.833 --> 33:41.250
No.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.541
I'm wearying the burgundy ones.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.791
The really tiny ones.

33:45.875 --> 33:47.791
Yeah.

33:47.875 --> 33:49.416
But they are bothering me a little

33:49.500 --> 33:53.958
because they slip inside me.

33:54.041 --> 33:54.875
And you?

33:55.833 --> 33:57.500
What are you doing?

33:58.541 --> 34:00.000
Oh!

34:00.083 --> 34:01.291
And how?

34:09.083 --> 34:12.166
You really are a pig.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.541
You know that?

34:13.625 --> 34:16.333
Yeah, I'm a piggy too.

34:16.416 --> 34:18.125
A real pig.

34:18.208 --> 34:19.958
The ice cubes are melting.

34:20.041 --> 34:24.750
I'm going to lie on the bed now.
Yeah, yeah, I'm lying down.

34:24.833 --> 34:28.416
-Bravo! Well done! Amazing!
-Come on, keep it down.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.083
That's the way. That's it.

34:30.166 --> 34:32.875
-Let's see what we've got here.
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

34:34.416 --> 34:37.750
-I've never done anything like that.
-Well, it's not like it hurt you.

34:37.833 --> 34:40.208
Hey, it was
like Alvaro Vitali and Bombolo.

34:40.291 --> 34:41.958
-Remember those clowns?
-Starring Fenech?

34:42.041 --> 34:43.708
She reminded me more of Sharon Stone,

34:43.791 --> 34:46.666
where she crosses her legs
without her panties on.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.375
You liked it, eh?
You're honest out of fear, not principle.

34:49.458 --> 34:52.708
Hey, gimme my hat back!
Come on, Jack, gimme my hat back.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.875
Come on.

34:54.958 --> 34:57.583
My God. My heart's racing.
I need a tranquilizer. I'll be right back.

34:57.666 --> 35:00.041
No, stop. What tranquilizer?

35:00.125 --> 35:02.416
Here. Come on. Drink this.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.833
-It's on the house.
-No, Jack, I-I get weird if I drink.

35:04.916 --> 35:06.375
What, are you normal now? Now drink.

35:06.458 --> 35:08.375
I saw you laughing
while horny for ten minutes.

35:08.458 --> 35:11.416
It was more than I hoped for.
Come on, drink.

35:20.958 --> 35:22.375
-Picchio.
-Hey, Spartaco.

35:22.458 --> 35:23.458
What's up?

35:23.541 --> 35:25.958
Our guys hasn't come out
of either one of these buildings.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.666
-Listen to Ferruccio.
-What does he have to say?

35:28.750 --> 35:32.083
A friend of mine knows about him. He says
he lives in the dump behind the <i>gasometro.</i>

35:32.166 --> 35:34.875
He cleans out cellars, hauls stuff away.
Things like that with a van.

35:34.958 --> 35:37.541
He worked with his brother,
but nobody knows what happened to him.

35:37.625 --> 35:40.500
-Take me to where this asshole lives.
-I've already checked the place out.

35:40.583 --> 35:43.083
The property's barred up.
Plus, the van ain't there anymore.

35:43.166 --> 35:45.041
And tell your friend
that I wanna know more.

35:45.125 --> 35:48.333
If he has a girlfriend, a son, a wife,
if we can find his brother. Got it?

35:48.416 --> 35:50.541
So is it true what they say?
That he stole from Caino?

35:50.625 --> 35:53.166
-If he did that, he's a dead man.
-Just wait till we catch him.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.500
Caino will stuff him in a slot machine.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.625
-In fact, you know what I think?
-Hey, relax, Marzio.

35:57.708 --> 35:59.375
Thinking is bad for your health.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.250
I got a different idea.
We'll do the usual.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.750
Do we have the stuff in the car?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.375
Kind of respect
the dumb son of a fucking bitch.

36:07.458 --> 36:10.291
Stealing from that shit stain Caino
takes balls.

36:10.375 --> 36:11.833
In fact, you know what I'm gonna do?

36:11.916 --> 36:14.750
When we find him, I'm gonna shake his
hand out of respect, then shoot him.

36:14.833 --> 36:17.375
Yeah, but remember
that Caino wants him alive.

36:17.458 --> 36:18.833
And if we take the money?

36:18.916 --> 36:21.541
What do you mean "we take the money"?
Take it for ourselves?

36:22.375 --> 36:24.333
This isn't that complicated.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.458
Just tell him, "Dad, if I have to fail,
I wanna fail at something I like doing."

36:27.541 --> 36:29.500
Who's stopping you?

36:29.583 --> 36:31.000
Nobody. Um, I don't--

36:31.083 --> 36:33.583
I don't even have the guts
to show him the drawings I do.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.916
I mean, I should have never been born.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.250
My parents had me late in life.

36:38.333 --> 36:40.583
No one was expecting my mom
to get pregnant.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.416
You don't wanna study.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.875
You don't have the courage
to do what you like.

36:45.541 --> 36:48.375
You have this neon light,
and you don't use it.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.375
You don't even wanna fix it.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.583
And you don't have the balls
to speak with your father.

36:52.666 --> 36:55.791
If I had more time,
I'd fix you as well. Ha!

36:55.875 --> 36:57.708
Depressed artist, come and see this.

37:00.916 --> 37:02.416
Jack, that's awesome.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.666
Who the fuck is that?

37:19.083 --> 37:19.916
Who is it?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.500
Water department.
There's a leak in the area.

37:31.541 --> 37:32.916
-Hello.
-Hi, there.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.916
We'll take a quick look
and then go.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.791
We have to check the whole building.

37:37.625 --> 37:39.166
Are you working overtime?

37:39.250 --> 37:40.708
It's an emergency.

37:51.083 --> 37:52.166
May I?

37:52.250 --> 37:53.375
Yes, yes, go ahead.

38:11.208 --> 38:12.333
Kitchen's fine.

38:12.416 --> 38:13.541
Where's the bathroom?

38:14.041 --> 38:15.833
The bathroom's right there.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.500
You know,
my son's crazy about comic books.

38:23.583 --> 38:26.208
Oh, yeah? How old is he?

38:26.291 --> 38:29.666
He's 12, and he has the same hat
that you're wearing.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.500
Oh.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.500
Anything unusual

38:48.875 --> 38:49.916
in the last few days?

38:50.916 --> 38:53.000
Unusual in regards to the water?

39:00.250 --> 39:03.125
No, everything's…
everything's normal, all normal.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.375
The bathroom's perfectly fine.

39:09.791 --> 39:11.416
Okay then.

39:12.333 --> 39:13.166
You take care.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.708
-Bye, take care.
-Sorry for bothering you.

39:15.791 --> 39:17.375
No problem at all.

39:30.208 --> 39:32.916
No fucking way
they were from the water department.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.625
They're looking for you because
of the money in your backpack, right?

39:41.625 --> 39:44.500
The less you know,
the safer you are, so don't ask again.

39:48.791 --> 39:51.166
I'm not gonna stay here
too much longer anyway.

39:56.750 --> 40:00.625
You see, it took five minutes,
and you earned a pound of self-esteem.

40:01.333 --> 40:03.208
-Am I renovating the house?
-We are.

40:03.291 --> 40:04.333
Come on.

40:15.625 --> 40:16.833
Wow, they're beautiful.

40:16.916 --> 40:18.541
-Did you draw these?
-Put them down.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.083
-Why? They're really good.
-Put them down immediately! Now!

40:21.166 --> 40:23.416
-What, are you crazy?
-Put those drawings down right now!

40:23.500 --> 40:24.416
Put them down!

40:28.458 --> 40:29.875
Take them back.

40:30.875 --> 40:33.083
Now don't break my balls
'cause I need to get some sleep.

40:33.166 --> 40:34.708
Don't you dare make any noise.

40:45.083 --> 40:47.583
Mad as a hatter this guy.

41:07.291 --> 41:08.208
Giulia.

41:14.666 --> 41:16.500
Caino, I have an update for you.

41:21.750 --> 41:24.208
Caino, I have an update for you.

41:29.625 --> 41:32.708
You shouldn't disturb me when
I'm in the middle of very important work.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.041
Apologize.

41:37.583 --> 41:38.875
I said apologize!

41:43.833 --> 41:44.750
I'm sorry.

41:44.833 --> 41:48.250
Don't take advantage of the debt
of gratitude I owe your father.

41:48.333 --> 41:49.708
May God rest his soul.

41:51.791 --> 41:53.000
Go ahead.

41:55.458 --> 41:58.083
He's a nobody.
He cleans out cellars, hauls stuff away.

41:58.708 --> 41:59.666
A loser.

41:59.750 --> 42:03.291
Someone brave enough to steal
500,000 euros from Caino is no loser.

42:03.375 --> 42:06.250
But he'll never enjoy the money.
He's being hunted. Where can he go?

42:06.333 --> 42:09.750
He has to come out of whatever hole
he's hiding in eventually, right?

42:12.458 --> 42:14.625
He's never gonna enjoy the money.

42:16.250 --> 42:17.750
He's being hunted.

42:18.458 --> 42:19.875
He has to come out.

42:25.416 --> 42:28.333
More or less the same things
our poor friend Mario said.

42:33.333 --> 42:36.000
Gimme 24 hours,
I'll bring him here. I swear.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.250
Twenty-four hours.

42:38.833 --> 42:40.625
And I hope you have a good plan.

42:40.708 --> 42:44.333
The wind is never favorable for the sailor
who doesn't know where he's going.

42:46.916 --> 42:48.041
Now get out.

42:58.916 --> 43:02.333
You were right about Giulia.
What a fucking backstabbing whore.

43:04.958 --> 43:07.833
If it wasn't for my father, he'd have
gotten rid of me a long time ago.

43:07.916 --> 43:10.666
You understand?
This is bullshit.

43:10.750 --> 43:13.166
Meanwhile, my father ended up
saving Caino's entitled ass.

43:13.250 --> 43:15.000
He went to prison in his place.

43:16.625 --> 43:19.125
I'm only saying
that Caino can hurt us and badly.

43:19.750 --> 43:22.458
And then that psychopath
Buzzetti really scares me.

43:22.541 --> 43:24.666
It's as though he actually enjoys killing.

43:25.333 --> 43:26.958
I'll have Buzzetti for breakfast.

43:27.041 --> 43:29.541
It's that shit Caino
that I wanna see on his knees.

43:29.625 --> 43:32.875
He'll be crawling on the floor.
I'll make him lick my shoes.

43:32.958 --> 43:34.083
So what do we do now?

43:34.166 --> 43:37.083
We told him 24 hours. We'll never make it.
You put yourself in a tough spot.

43:37.166 --> 43:41.250
Ah, come on, Marzio. What the fuck?
You too? All you do is bring bad luck!

43:41.333 --> 43:43.541
Fucking hell, man! Fuck!

45:00.958 --> 45:02.416
It's a detective story.

45:05.916 --> 45:08.416
A metropolitan thriller
that's set in Garbatella.

45:10.250 --> 45:12.416
Which looks like
a nice quiet neighborhood.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.250
Not even with your imagination
do you leave home, huh?

45:15.333 --> 45:19.125
At least <i>Sàlgari </i>was brave enough
to imagine Malaysia from his desk.

45:19.208 --> 45:21.833
-Salgàri.
-Whatever. Him.

45:26.041 --> 45:27.833
These drawings are amazing.

45:29.500 --> 45:31.458
Why are you wasting
your time studying economics?

45:36.833 --> 45:39.791
Have you show any of these drawings
to the little woman you like?

45:39.875 --> 45:42.375
-What are you talking about?
-Don't play dumb.

45:42.458 --> 45:44.833
I saw her picture in the bathroom
behind the tranquilizers.

45:44.916 --> 45:47.166
I don't even wanna know
why you put it in there.

45:47.958 --> 45:49.416
So what's her name?

45:50.375 --> 45:51.375
Rebecca.

45:52.625 --> 45:55.375
And what about the friend who
was looking out with her from the landing?

45:55.458 --> 45:59.166
Well, she's from Seville.
She's Spanish.

45:59.250 --> 46:01.208
They did a semester abroad together.

46:01.291 --> 46:02.625
The Spanish are beautiful.

46:02.708 --> 46:04.166
Clean, no makeup.

46:04.958 --> 46:06.291
All natural.

46:10.458 --> 46:13.875
-Have you ever spoken to Rebecca?
-No.

46:18.750 --> 46:19.833
Yes.

46:21.333 --> 46:24.458
Yes, we talked a few times
because she wanted to borrow my DVDs.

46:24.541 --> 46:28.166
She's working on a dissertation on Italian
cinema from the '60s and '70s for school.

46:28.250 --> 46:30.250
Now I know why you have
all this stuff.

46:30.333 --> 46:32.666
You wanna look cool in front of her.
I get it.

46:33.166 --> 46:35.208
Look cool? Did you see who she was with?

46:35.291 --> 46:38.541
-What am I supposed to do? What do I--
-Stop right now.

46:38.625 --> 46:40.041
Even the cleverest of women fall

46:40.125 --> 46:42.250
for a garbage human being
at least once in their lives.

46:42.333 --> 46:44.500
Trust me.
All the ones I went out with were clever.

46:44.583 --> 46:46.166
Yeah, for sure.

46:46.833 --> 46:48.166
That was a joke.

46:49.125 --> 46:50.875
So there's no problem.

46:50.958 --> 46:53.083
But you'll never know unless you try.

46:53.750 --> 46:56.750
Maybe she wouldn't mind if you tried.
She did just break up with that asshole.

46:56.833 --> 46:59.541
-No, it's complicated.
-No, you're making it complicated.

47:00.208 --> 47:02.666
Listen, some women are only after money,

47:02.750 --> 47:04.958
others after looks, some character.

47:07.250 --> 47:11.125
Money-wise, you're not doing too great.
Character-wise, we need to work on it.

47:11.208 --> 47:13.583
With looks, you're kind of,
you're thinking, "I'm doomed."

47:13.666 --> 47:15.291
-Well, I mean, yeah.
-But you're not.

47:15.375 --> 47:18.750
Because you have something
that interests someone like Rebecca.

47:18.833 --> 47:20.041
I'm sure of it.

47:21.833 --> 47:22.916
You have a soul.

47:24.000 --> 47:24.958
I have a soul?

47:26.875 --> 47:29.708
I mean, it's… it's just kind of weird
to hear you talk about the soul.

47:29.791 --> 47:32.583
-Why, do you have the copyrights?
-No.

47:32.666 --> 47:34.708
A soul is something
you either have or you don't have.

47:34.791 --> 47:36.000
Nietzsche said it so too.

47:36.083 --> 47:37.916
Educate yourself.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.625
Now you're thinking, "What the fuck
does he know about Nietzsche?"

47:40.708 --> 47:41.708
Well…

47:43.583 --> 47:47.208
Instead, I'm thinking it's
not gonna be easy to get out of here.

47:58.166 --> 47:59.000
Got it?

47:59.083 --> 48:00.791
I'll come back
when everything's ready.

48:00.875 --> 48:02.625
-Let me know right away. Bye.
-Okay.

48:12.500 --> 48:13.333
Hey!

48:13.916 --> 48:16.041
Rebecca is coming up with her friend.
Go talk to her.

48:16.125 --> 48:19.250
-No way. I'll make a fool of myself.
-Just pretend you're leaving right now.

48:19.333 --> 48:21.875
You help her with her shopping bags
and invite her over for dinner.

48:21.958 --> 48:24.166
-Kind but firm. Tell her you'll cook.
-I can't even cook.

48:24.250 --> 48:26.833
-And I have no idea where to start, no.
-What kind of man are you?

48:26.916 --> 48:29.083
-Only if you come with me.
-I went with you to steal.

48:29.166 --> 48:30.875
This is something you have to do
on your own.

48:30.958 --> 48:34.083
-No, no, no, no. No way, no.
-It's time to grow some balls. Come on.

48:34.666 --> 48:36.500
No. No, no, no, no.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.958
<i>-</i>Hola.
-Oh, hi, Ludovico.

48:42.041 --> 48:43.708
Got a heavy load. Can I lend you a hand?

48:43.791 --> 48:45.125
-Ah, thank you.
-Thanks a lot.

48:45.208 --> 48:48.166
-Were you going out?
-No, I was just coming home from a walk.

48:48.250 --> 48:49.458
That's a very cute hat.

48:49.541 --> 48:50.666
Oh, thank you.

48:52.375 --> 48:55.375
Oh, this is Amanda. I don't know
if you remember. I told you about her.

48:55.458 --> 48:58.708
You did a semester abroad together, right?
I'm L-Ludovico.

48:58.791 --> 49:01.833
Uh, sorry, I really
have to run to the bathroom to pee.

49:01.916 --> 49:03.333
She's nice, huh?

49:03.416 --> 49:05.458
Listen, since we've
just bumped into each other,

49:05.541 --> 49:07.083
I'd like to ask you something.

49:07.166 --> 49:09.583
I mean, actually,
I've been meaning to ask you for a while,

49:09.666 --> 49:11.750
but I don't know.
I didn't… I didn't wanna be a pain.

49:11.833 --> 49:13.791
You, a pain for me? Of course not.

49:14.416 --> 49:15.500
My thesis.

49:15.583 --> 49:17.750
Italian cinema of the '60s. Dino Risi…

49:18.333 --> 49:20.125
You're an expert, aren't you?

49:20.208 --> 49:21.833
Y-y-yeah, yeah.

49:22.958 --> 49:25.875
Is there any chance
you could help me with it?

49:25.958 --> 49:28.041
-Please… Please don't say no.
-No.

49:28.625 --> 49:30.416
I mean, I mean--

49:30.500 --> 49:32.375
Yes, that is-- it's… it's not a problem.

49:32.458 --> 49:34.583
Absolutely not
and I'm a big fan of Dino Risi.

49:34.666 --> 49:36.208
So, uh, I don't know.

49:36.291 --> 49:39.583
We could watch a few movies,
analyze them together.

49:39.666 --> 49:41.875
-That would be great.
-Um,

49:41.958 --> 49:45.500
<i>A Difficult Life, The Widower,</i>
<i>Scent of a Woman…</i>

49:45.583 --> 49:48.041
Well, what about
if I come to your apartment?

49:48.750 --> 49:49.958
You… You come to my place?

49:51.833 --> 49:54.791
One of my favorite Dino Risi films
is a crime anthology actually,

49:54.875 --> 49:57.666
with Nino Manfredi.
It has such incredible acting.

49:57.750 --> 49:59.875
And it's called<i> I See Naked.</i>

49:59.958 --> 50:03.875
Hey, it took you a long time
to walk up those few steps.

50:04.958 --> 50:07.750
Uh, the, uh,
these are <i>mucho </i>heavy, so…

50:07.833 --> 50:09.333
If you need me, I'll be in the shower.

50:10.125 --> 50:12.250
Yes, yes. Please, come inside.

50:14.875 --> 50:16.541
You want me
to put these on the table here?

50:16.625 --> 50:18.041
Yes, thanks a lot.

50:19.125 --> 50:21.166
-Hey, Ludovico.
-Yeah.

50:21.250 --> 50:23.000
You know
anything about plumbing?

50:23.083 --> 50:24.250
Uh, of course.

50:24.333 --> 50:25.791
It's that damn faucet.

50:25.875 --> 50:28.708
I've asked the manager 300 times
to come sort it out.

50:28.791 --> 50:31.291
Do you think you could maybe--
Ami, can you show him?

50:31.375 --> 50:32.916
Come, come, Ludo.

50:35.041 --> 50:37.125
You see, uh, I turn on the shower.

50:37.208 --> 50:39.541
-And the thing there, it got stuck.
-Mm-hmm.

50:41.416 --> 50:42.333
Um…

50:42.416 --> 50:44.208
That one there.

50:51.708 --> 50:53.833
<i>Sí.</i>

50:53.916 --> 50:56.916
The problem is it's b-burst.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.458
-I'm sorry. I'm… I'm sorry.
-Ludovico.

51:24.083 --> 51:25.166
Piece of shit.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.083
You looking for someone?

51:29.166 --> 51:31.166
-Get out of the way.
-I asked you a question.

51:31.250 --> 51:32.458
Out of the way, asshole.

51:32.541 --> 51:35.250
You're the one who beats up women,
and I'm the asshole, huh?

51:36.625 --> 51:39.375
You go anywhere near Rebecca again,
and you're a dead man.

51:39.458 --> 51:42.125
She's with a friend of mine now.
He's even more dangerous than I am.

51:42.208 --> 51:43.833
She doesn't wanna see you here again.

51:43.916 --> 51:46.583
Show up one more time
and this shitty little face of yours…

51:46.666 --> 51:49.333
…boom! Boom!

51:50.916 --> 51:53.041
-I'll destroy you.
-Mm-hmm.

51:53.125 --> 51:54.416
-Got it?
-Mm-hmm.

51:54.500 --> 51:56.833
-Hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

51:58.500 --> 52:01.000
And you pissed yourself
on top of everything. Some hero you are.

52:01.083 --> 52:03.041
Now get up and get lost. You stink.

52:03.125 --> 52:04.666
-Go on, get.
-I'm… I-I'm going.

52:05.250 --> 52:06.250
Run away.

52:14.083 --> 52:15.000
Hey!

52:15.083 --> 52:17.375
No, no, no, no, easy, easy, bro.
What happened to you?

52:17.458 --> 52:18.916
What the fuck happened to you?

52:19.000 --> 52:21.625
Fucker had a gun. If it weren't for that,
I'd have kicked the shit--

52:21.708 --> 52:24.791
Did he really have a gun, bro?
Listen, does he look like this?

52:27.375 --> 52:29.041
Hey, where you going? Where you--

52:40.875 --> 52:42.916
Thanks anyway.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.541
Jack, you tried your best.

52:44.625 --> 52:47.375
Yeah, come on.
I think it stopped now, no?

52:47.958 --> 52:50.583
Anyway, tomorrow I'll call a plumber,
a good one.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.416
A real one.

52:53.500 --> 52:55.083
I really tried. I'm sorry.

52:55.166 --> 52:56.833
To thank you for your effort,

52:56.916 --> 52:59.166
I'd like to cook my famous paella.

52:59.250 --> 53:02.083
Oh, yeah, sure, come on.
Why don't we have a dinner together?

53:02.166 --> 53:04.000
Tomorrow night? Would you like that?

53:04.083 --> 53:05.000
Do we like that?

53:05.583 --> 53:07.750
Well, yeah, I'd say yes too.

53:07.833 --> 53:10.708
We'll have Italian versus Spanish.
You make paella. We make amatriciana.

53:10.791 --> 53:14.750
If you cook and do
everything else like you do plumbing…

53:21.208 --> 53:22.083
Hmm.

53:22.166 --> 53:24.916
Nothing like this
has ever happened to me before.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.375
I fucking love you, Jack.
Are you my guardian angel?

53:27.458 --> 53:30.750
It's called Stockholm Syndrome.
You fell in love with your kidnapper.

53:30.833 --> 53:32.666
Well, actually,
it's a fucking stroke of luck.

53:32.750 --> 53:34.500
I looked like
such a moron with that shower.

53:34.583 --> 53:37.333
But I told you I couldn't do it.
That's why I asked you to come up.

53:37.416 --> 53:39.916
Anyway, the little Spaniard
was eating you up with her eyes, huh?

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
We're out of booze,
not to mention, weed.

53:42.083 --> 53:44.041
Well, no,
I should have some here, I think.

53:44.791 --> 53:47.625
I just don't use it often.
It makes me a bit anxious.

53:48.416 --> 53:51.958
But since I'm already anxious,
maybe it'll help me this time.

53:52.041 --> 53:53.625
How long have you smoked weed?

53:53.708 --> 53:55.500
I don't know.
For a while. I don't smoke much.

54:01.583 --> 54:02.583
Alone, obviously.

54:02.666 --> 54:03.708
Always alone.

54:04.666 --> 54:06.250
But maybe next time with Rebecca.

54:13.958 --> 54:15.791
Everything's sorted.
I took care of it.

54:15.875 --> 54:18.083
-You did great. Here.
-And then?

54:18.833 --> 54:21.250
-The rest when we say goodbye.
-Okay.

54:21.333 --> 54:22.875
-Ciao.
-Bye.

54:40.583 --> 54:43.791
Look at this.
You could be my little brother.

54:43.875 --> 54:45.875
'Cause I'm so tall, and you're short.

54:47.166 --> 54:48.583
I wanna be like you.

54:53.166 --> 54:55.166
Do you really think
that I'm better than you?

54:57.583 --> 54:58.583
Look right there.

55:01.416 --> 55:03.041
Stay the way you are.

55:03.125 --> 55:05.458
You don't wanna be like someone else.
Trust me.

55:12.625 --> 55:14.833
I'm a thief.

55:14.916 --> 55:16.166
Always have been.

55:18.208 --> 55:19.750
Started saving a little bit of money

55:19.833 --> 55:22.541
and now I can live off the interest
from this last job.

55:27.416 --> 55:28.916
I have a cover job.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.041
I clean out cellars,
haul stuff away, little jobs like that.

55:32.125 --> 55:34.208
I even provide invoices.

55:36.041 --> 55:37.666
I used to work with my brother.

55:39.916 --> 55:42.333
Everything I know about life,
I learned from him.

55:44.041 --> 55:46.958
Although the more you try to understand
this life, the less you seem to get.

55:47.041 --> 55:48.375
You have a brother?

55:56.875 --> 55:58.916
He's eight years older.

56:00.666 --> 56:03.375
Paolo. We used to steal together.

56:03.458 --> 56:05.708
But he played the saxophone.
He was in a band.

56:06.333 --> 56:08.958
When people say it's the parents' fault
if someone grows up wrong,

56:09.041 --> 56:10.708
I always laugh.

56:11.291 --> 56:14.125
My father died at the farmers market.
It was an accident.

56:16.625 --> 56:19.458
Then my mom a year later.

56:20.500 --> 56:23.750
She was a cleaning lady.

56:25.208 --> 56:28.833
They were good, honest people.
Me and Paolo, thieves.

56:32.083 --> 56:34.500
How come? Don't know.

56:38.458 --> 56:42.458
I was 18
when he left the country.

56:42.541 --> 56:44.500
He would always tell me, "Study."

56:45.791 --> 56:47.333
"And read books."

56:47.416 --> 56:49.916
He would buy them by the dozens.
I still have 'em.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.416
And the helmet. I'd never part with it
because I'm attached to it.

56:56.833 --> 57:01.208
-Yeah, but he still left you by yourself.
-No. No, he even said to me,

57:01.291 --> 57:04.000
"Come with me.
Come on, it'll be a turning point."

57:04.083 --> 57:06.833
But I didn't feel like leaving. Mm.

57:08.416 --> 57:12.708
Then he got together with
this Brazilian girl, nice piece of ass.

57:13.208 --> 57:15.041
I was even a little bit jealous.

57:23.583 --> 57:24.625
Look here.

57:30.541 --> 57:33.458
"Mar do Paraíso." Look at that.

57:33.541 --> 57:35.666
-Damn!
-He sent it to me three years ago.

57:35.750 --> 57:38.958
-Sure you'll find him when you go there?
-I'll find him. I'll find him.

57:39.041 --> 57:41.833
Paolo's a very clever guy.
Everyone must know him.

57:41.916 --> 57:45.708
If this shit didn't fucking happen,
I'd probably already be there right now.

57:47.083 --> 57:48.666
Morning on the beach.

57:49.458 --> 57:52.875
Afternoon in a hammock with a good book.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.208
And at night, clubbing with all the women.

57:59.166 --> 58:01.375
Did you know that
the Nazis would burn books?

58:03.125 --> 58:04.416
They were scared of them.

58:06.500 --> 58:08.500
And they were scared of women too.

58:09.708 --> 58:13.541
You know, the SS encouraged their soldiers
to fuck one another all the time.

58:13.625 --> 58:15.791
So what though?

58:15.875 --> 58:17.875
-I swear it's true.
-But so what?

58:26.083 --> 58:28.958
I used to beg my father
to let me come and live here on my own.

58:31.125 --> 58:33.125
I wanted to show him what I was worth.

58:36.500 --> 58:37.833
I felt like an artist.

58:37.916 --> 58:40.666
I wanted to sort out the apartment
in my own unique way.

58:45.333 --> 58:47.458
But then I locked myself inside it.

58:47.541 --> 58:48.416
Alone.

58:49.125 --> 58:52.125
As you say, always alone.

58:52.208 --> 58:54.958
To be honest, I'd feel lonely
in a place full of people.

58:57.458 --> 58:59.958
I've always felt this way
since I was a kid.

59:01.125 --> 59:04.083
The only world in which I'm happy
is the world of drawings.

59:05.208 --> 59:07.333
I mean, in the world I draw up, you know?

59:07.875 --> 59:09.000
I don't know.

59:09.625 --> 59:12.416
Maybe I'm scared to find out who I am,
scared of discovering myself,

59:12.500 --> 59:15.041
of… of seeing myself.

59:19.041 --> 59:20.875
Of disappointing my folks.

59:20.958 --> 59:22.375
Don't hide behind your parents.

59:22.458 --> 59:24.666
Ludi, you're not a child.
You're too old for that.

59:25.333 --> 59:27.708
You don't have to feel alone.

59:27.791 --> 59:29.541
Humanity is alone.

59:29.625 --> 59:31.208
It's not easy for anyone.

59:34.166 --> 59:36.541
This joint is the fucking shit.

59:36.625 --> 59:40.375
It's making us talk like…
like philosophers.

59:44.166 --> 59:46.208
You know what I think?

59:46.291 --> 59:48.791
-Hmm.
-Don't know.

59:51.333 --> 59:52.958
Well, you make it look pretty easy.

59:53.041 --> 59:55.791
I mean, your answer
to literally everything is "don't know."

59:55.875 --> 59:57.375
I know that I do not know.

59:58.333 --> 59:59.333
Don't know.

1:00:00.208 --> 1:00:03.500
It is ancient wisdom.

1:00:05.833 --> 1:00:07.125
You know who said that?

1:00:08.333 --> 1:00:11.083
Socrates.

1:00:12.041 --> 1:00:13.250
<i>So now that…</i>

1:00:15.666 --> 1:00:19.333
our guy smashed the face of that
stuck-up asshole, we know he has a gun.

1:00:21.708 --> 1:00:23.583
And we know he's in stairwell A.

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.458
We finally found that fucker.

1:00:30.166 --> 1:00:33.208
And how's that? Didn't you
already check that old staircase?

1:00:33.291 --> 1:00:35.416
We checked every apartment, Caino.
We didn't see him.

1:00:37.208 --> 1:00:38.875
You didn't search thoroughly.

1:00:42.208 --> 1:00:44.083
We searched very thoroughly.

1:00:46.500 --> 1:00:49.666
If you had, you would have found him,
but no. Instead, Picchio did.

1:00:50.541 --> 1:00:53.666
And you come here and tell me,
"We finally found that fucker"?

1:00:53.750 --> 1:00:56.791
By the way, your language is
really starting to rub me the wrong way.

1:00:57.416 --> 1:01:00.625
I gave you a second chance,
and yet, you wasted it of course.

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:02.708
Pearls before swine.

1:01:03.541 --> 1:01:06.916
So people can wrong Caino
and not suffer the consequences.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.666
That's what everybody will think, right?

1:01:08.750 --> 1:01:10.708
Give him 24 hours, he's gonna find him.

1:01:14.791 --> 1:01:17.208
My debt
to your father ends today, Spartaco.

1:01:20.166 --> 1:01:21.625
You no longer work for me.

1:01:22.625 --> 1:01:25.041
And be grateful
that destiny gave you a good friend

1:01:25.125 --> 1:01:27.041
who can pay
for your mistakes when necessary.

1:01:30.916 --> 1:01:32.750
You believe in destiny, Marzio?

1:01:35.083 --> 1:01:37.500
Marzio! Marzio!

1:01:39.958 --> 1:01:42.375
Look at me. Look at me.

1:01:42.458 --> 1:01:43.541
Marzio.

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:46.750
Marzio.

1:01:49.541 --> 1:01:50.958
I'll kill you!

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.166
Your father sacrificed his life for me.

1:02:05.666 --> 1:02:07.625
In return, I'm going to spare yours.

1:02:08.291 --> 1:02:09.958
Now get out of here.

1:02:10.541 --> 1:02:13.625
And from this day on,
make sure you never cross my path again.

1:02:41.583 --> 1:02:43.208
It would've been better to kill him.

1:02:43.291 --> 1:02:47.541
There's a time and a place for everything.
Now I want you to go and look for our guy.

1:02:47.625 --> 1:02:49.166
Find out the apartment number.

1:02:50.083 --> 1:02:52.458
And when you find him, take me to him.

1:02:52.541 --> 1:02:54.666
I wanna deal with him myself.
He's earned it.

1:03:29.958 --> 1:03:31.125
Scared, huh?

1:03:31.208 --> 1:03:33.833
-What is wrong with you?
-I was joking. I was joking!

1:03:33.916 --> 1:03:36.708
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I was joking!

1:03:49.625 --> 1:03:53.708
You fucking moron. Get off me.

1:04:40.375 --> 1:04:42.166
You never shoot with your eyes closed.

1:04:43.208 --> 1:04:44.500
If your hand shakes, you miss,

1:04:44.583 --> 1:04:46.875
and if you miss,
you won't have time for the second shot.

1:04:49.083 --> 1:04:50.208
Trintignant.

1:04:55.875 --> 1:04:58.000
Stop, doesn't suit you.

1:04:59.791 --> 1:05:03.041
-How long did I sleep?
-A long time. It's two in the afternoon.

1:05:03.125 --> 1:05:05.625
-You got painkillers? I have a headache.
-Yeah.

1:05:18.333 --> 1:05:19.916
Always here these guys.

1:05:22.416 --> 1:05:24.375
Did you clean up the apartment?

1:05:24.458 --> 1:05:26.666
Yes, sir. I got up early today. All clean.

1:05:30.291 --> 1:05:31.208
Here.

1:05:36.458 --> 1:05:38.000
Another step forward.

1:05:38.541 --> 1:05:39.791
Well done.

1:05:39.875 --> 1:05:41.666
If only your dad could see it now.

1:05:41.750 --> 1:05:45.041
Poor guy. Every time
he leaves me money, I feel really guilty.

1:05:45.125 --> 1:05:46.875
You still have
the 5,000 I promised, right?

1:05:47.583 --> 1:05:49.083
Yes, thank you again.

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:58.458
How long will it take you
to finish the comic?

1:05:58.541 --> 1:06:01.166
-What do you mean by "how long"?
-You know, how long?

1:06:01.250 --> 1:06:04.458
How long will it take you
to draw it, print it, publish it.

1:06:04.541 --> 1:06:07.750
I don't know.
Could be four to six months tops.

1:06:07.833 --> 1:06:09.000
Okay, let's say a year.

1:06:09.083 --> 1:06:11.958
-Take a sabbatical and I'll finance you.
-A year sabbatical?

1:06:12.041 --> 1:06:15.583
You don't worry about anything.
Just sit there, draw what you like.

1:06:15.666 --> 1:06:18.875
Money's not a problem for me anymore.
There's a fortune in that bag.

1:06:19.708 --> 1:06:21.458
After a year,
if it doesn't work out for you,

1:06:21.541 --> 1:06:23.000
you go back to what you're doing now.

1:06:23.083 --> 1:06:25.333
You're behind with your exams anyway,
aren't you?

1:06:25.416 --> 1:06:26.250
Yeah, I'm behind.

1:06:26.333 --> 1:06:29.083
I already told you.
If you're gonna have to fail in life,

1:06:29.166 --> 1:06:31.250
it's better to fail
at something you like to do.

1:06:31.333 --> 1:06:33.083
Thanks for your faith in me.

1:06:41.041 --> 1:06:42.416
-Hey.
-What?

1:06:42.916 --> 1:06:44.333
What's there to think about?

1:06:45.708 --> 1:06:47.458
I can withdraw the offer.

1:06:51.583 --> 1:06:54.000
Seriously. Who the fuck else
would make you an offer like that?

1:06:55.625 --> 1:06:56.666
You know what?

1:06:58.000 --> 1:06:59.041
I'm gonna try.

1:06:59.125 --> 1:07:02.625
I'll try. I'll try. I'll try.
I'll go for it. I'll focus. I'll do it.

1:07:02.708 --> 1:07:06.125
I'll go ahead and submit the comic,
and if it works out, I'll even publish it.

1:07:06.208 --> 1:07:08.333
I'll even put in a dedication
for you on the front page.

1:07:08.416 --> 1:07:09.750
Dedicate it to Rebecca, Ludovico.

1:07:09.833 --> 1:07:12.875
I just need you to send me
50% of the profits when I'm over there.

1:07:16.166 --> 1:07:17.000
Rebecca.

1:07:18.416 --> 1:07:20.791
No, it's Jack. Shh!

1:07:23.333 --> 1:07:24.208
Huh?

1:07:24.916 --> 1:07:26.583
Paella versus amatriciana?

1:07:29.916 --> 1:07:31.625
That's fine. <i>Hasta la vista.</i>

1:07:31.708 --> 1:07:33.000
May the best win.

1:07:33.083 --> 1:07:34.416
Bye.

1:07:34.500 --> 1:07:36.666
There. In case Rebecca calls you back.

1:07:36.750 --> 1:07:38.250
Just don't call the police on me.

1:07:38.333 --> 1:07:41.708
It's been forever since a girl called me.
Listen, what about the amatriciana?

1:07:41.791 --> 1:07:43.500
Pasta, jowl bacon, pecorino, tomatoes.

1:07:44.541 --> 1:07:45.375
Here.

1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:50.500
Now fuck it. Come on.
Get everything you need.

1:07:51.333 --> 1:07:52.416
Get the fuck out.

1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:54.666
Me, go outside?

1:07:57.250 --> 1:08:00.958
Make sure you act normal when you pass
those kids down there on the scooters.

1:08:01.041 --> 1:08:02.541
-Act normal?
-No.

1:08:02.625 --> 1:08:04.500
Don't act normal. Act Ludovico.

1:08:15.083 --> 1:08:17.458
And then we're gonna add this at the end.

1:08:17.541 --> 1:08:20.416
-Try the sauce, see how it is.
-Ah, you try it.

1:08:20.916 --> 1:08:23.291
Okay, well, it's pretty hot.

1:08:25.125 --> 1:08:26.458
Mm.

1:08:27.625 --> 1:08:29.333
-Wow, it's so good.
-Mm.

1:08:29.416 --> 1:08:31.791
Anyone would screw a guy
who made an amatriciana this good.

1:08:31.875 --> 1:08:35.041
Then say I made it. You know the Spaniard
would screw you even on an empty stomach.

1:08:35.125 --> 1:08:37.041
You wish.

1:08:37.125 --> 1:08:38.208
Who the fuck is here now?

1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:41.166
It's probably Rebecca.

1:08:49.250 --> 1:08:51.208
-Good evening.
-Hi, there.

1:08:55.166 --> 1:08:56.375
Gas department.

1:08:56.458 --> 1:08:57.791
A leak has been reported.

1:08:59.166 --> 1:09:00.083
Come in.

1:09:01.583 --> 1:09:02.416
Look, your colleagues

1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:04.708
from the water department
have been here already.

1:09:04.791 --> 1:09:06.583
Is something happening
in the neighborhood?

1:09:07.666 --> 1:09:09.708
No, don't worry about that.

1:09:11.833 --> 1:09:12.875
Where's the meter?

1:09:13.541 --> 1:09:15.625
The meter's over there under the sink.

1:09:35.125 --> 1:09:36.416
Everything okay?

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.125
For now, yeah.

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.458
Yes, yes, I draw.

1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.083
-The bathroom?
-The bathroom is right there on the right.

1:10:06.166 --> 1:10:08.541
If you want,
I'll turn on the light for you.

1:10:28.458 --> 1:10:29.416
Electric.

1:10:40.750 --> 1:10:41.875
And the bedroom.

1:10:43.375 --> 1:10:47.458
In the bedroom,
there's nothing connected to the gas.

1:11:21.958 --> 1:11:22.916
Of course.

1:11:23.750 --> 1:11:24.708
There's nothing.

1:11:25.625 --> 1:11:26.500
No.

1:11:28.083 --> 1:11:29.125
Yes, right?

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.125
There's nothing here.

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.375
Mmm!

1:11:38.458 --> 1:11:41.500
Well, so, um, I was making amatriciana.

1:11:41.583 --> 1:11:43.166
My grandmother's secret recipe.

1:11:43.916 --> 1:11:44.791
And…

1:11:47.750 --> 1:11:49.541
if you don't mind, I'll show you out.

1:11:51.750 --> 1:11:54.041
-Parmesan?
-Pecorino, of course.

1:11:54.125 --> 1:11:55.166
Pecorino, huh?

1:11:55.250 --> 1:11:57.250
Parmesan
on amatriciana would be a crime.

1:11:57.333 --> 1:11:59.708
It would be a crime,
of course. Right?

1:11:59.791 --> 1:12:02.708
Absolutely. Goodbye.

1:12:17.875 --> 1:12:19.166
Yeah, I found him.

1:12:20.750 --> 1:12:21.666
Stairwell A.

1:12:22.625 --> 1:12:23.791
Apartment 14.

1:12:31.833 --> 1:12:33.250
No, right now.

1:12:33.333 --> 1:12:36.375
I… I don't care if you're having dinner.
You need to get over here now.

1:12:40.916 --> 1:12:43.250
What's going on?
What are you doing?

1:12:45.708 --> 1:12:47.666
Do you know who that was?
Did you see his shoes?

1:12:47.750 --> 1:12:50.416
-Who, the gas guy?
-Yeah, right, the gas guy.

1:12:50.500 --> 1:12:52.708
He's a hitman, a psychopath.
He was looking for me here.

1:12:54.250 --> 1:12:56.750
Our friendship ends here, Ludovico.
I have to go.

1:12:56.833 --> 1:12:59.666
Don't worry. Come with me. Come over here.

1:12:59.750 --> 1:13:01.583
I'm gonna hide in there, okay?

1:13:01.666 --> 1:13:04.750
I made an arrangement with
a construction worker who lives nearby.

1:13:04.833 --> 1:13:07.333
You can't hide inside a dump truck.
It's very dangerous, Jack.

1:13:07.416 --> 1:13:09.291
I'll be at the airport in half an hour.

1:13:09.375 --> 1:13:12.291
Just make sure
they don't find you here, okay, hmm?

1:13:12.375 --> 1:13:13.250
You need to run.

1:13:13.916 --> 1:13:15.291
Look. Huh?

1:13:18.375 --> 1:13:20.333
This is the money
for your sabbatical, okay?

1:13:20.416 --> 1:13:22.291
I'll leave it here. Hmm?

1:13:22.958 --> 1:13:23.791
Hey.

1:13:25.500 --> 1:13:27.250
I'll be in touch when I get there.

1:13:27.333 --> 1:13:28.666
I'll buy you a ticket.

1:13:29.333 --> 1:13:32.291
You'll come meet my brother and make sure
you bring the published comic, hmm?

1:13:36.791 --> 1:13:40.250
Here, put this on. Two seconds.
All right, I'll be right there.

1:13:51.375 --> 1:13:53.208
Ludovico. Hey.

1:13:53.291 --> 1:13:54.708
Ludovico my ass! You hear me?

1:13:55.291 --> 1:13:57.458
You used me,
and now you're leaving like this?

1:13:58.750 --> 1:14:00.333
What will I do?

1:14:01.041 --> 1:14:02.208
What everyone does.

1:14:04.250 --> 1:14:06.000
I told you, everyone's alone.

1:14:06.083 --> 1:14:08.500
Yeah, sure.
Better to be alone than to be with you.

1:14:09.083 --> 1:14:11.291
You're used to it in your family,
aren't you?

1:14:13.750 --> 1:14:14.916
Go fuck yourself.

1:14:16.791 --> 1:14:18.125
You're not my brother.

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.208
Open up, dickhead. Hurry up.

1:15:04.416 --> 1:15:05.291
Come on.

1:15:06.166 --> 1:15:07.208
What are you doing?

1:15:07.291 --> 1:15:09.125
What am I doing?
I'll leave after dinner.

1:15:11.833 --> 1:15:14.208
Thank you, Jack.

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:17.750
You think
I would have missed out on the Spaniard?

1:15:18.333 --> 1:15:19.333
Thank you.

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.541
-Thank you!
-That's enough.

1:15:21.625 --> 1:15:23.250
Go and get the sauce.

1:15:25.250 --> 1:15:28.416
His name is Paolo.
Ten years ago he fled to Brazil.

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:31.583
His ID seems to show he's the brother
of the guy you're after.

1:15:33.083 --> 1:15:35.208
The perks of having a friend
in the police.

1:15:35.958 --> 1:15:39.000
Good work, Ferruccio.
Your name is Ferruccio, right?

1:15:39.916 --> 1:15:42.166
He who finds a friend, finds a treasure.

1:15:42.250 --> 1:15:46.375
And if find a friend that's a cop,
it's worth double the fortune.

1:15:46.458 --> 1:15:47.458
Thank you.

1:15:49.083 --> 1:15:50.750
Goodbye and good luck, Mr. Caino.

1:15:54.958 --> 1:15:56.291
It's true, isn't it?

1:15:57.583 --> 1:16:01.166
That all happy families
are very similar to each other.

1:16:01.708 --> 1:16:05.166
But every unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way.

1:16:05.250 --> 1:16:09.000
I'm gonna take this,
and you bring the pasta.

1:16:10.416 --> 1:16:12.375
Hopefully they'll have some wine.

1:16:12.458 --> 1:16:13.833
What are you doing?

1:16:13.916 --> 1:16:14.916
Gimme a second.

1:16:17.250 --> 1:16:19.958
Just in case
I bring Rebecca back down with me.

1:16:20.041 --> 1:16:21.166
Red lights.

1:16:21.833 --> 1:16:23.833
I taught you everything.

1:16:29.291 --> 1:16:31.958
Do you think the bald patch
in the middle stands out?

1:16:32.041 --> 1:16:33.166
You're fine as you are.

1:16:33.250 --> 1:16:35.666
The more you look, the less
you'll like yourself. Wild, right?

1:16:35.750 --> 1:16:37.666
You have your little hat anyway,
don't you?

1:16:43.583 --> 1:16:44.750
You know what, Jack?

1:16:49.958 --> 1:16:51.625
The hat's better like this.

1:16:53.250 --> 1:16:55.250
Oh, I put something in your bag
for the journey.

1:16:55.333 --> 1:16:57.416
-Sounds good.
-It's a surprise.

1:16:59.250 --> 1:17:00.500
-Hello.
-Hi.

1:17:01.500 --> 1:17:02.416
For later.

1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:04.458
Ah, <i>A Difficult Life.</i>

1:17:04.541 --> 1:17:05.916
Very difficult.

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:07.500
Come on in.

1:17:08.083 --> 1:17:11.375
Please tell me that you have wine
because we just realized that we ran out.

1:17:11.916 --> 1:17:14.166
Well, it's okay.
I can go back down and get some.

1:17:14.250 --> 1:17:17.083
No, no, no, no, no. Don't worry. Really.
We've got it. We've got plenty.

1:17:17.166 --> 1:17:18.291
-Okay.
-My jacket?

1:17:18.375 --> 1:17:19.875
Uh, you can hang it there.

1:17:19.958 --> 1:17:21.583
-Thanks.
-On the left. A hanger.

1:17:21.666 --> 1:17:25.291
-Can I give you a hand?
-Yes, can you open the wine?

1:17:26.583 --> 1:17:28.791
-Can I use this bottle opener?
-Yeah.

1:17:28.875 --> 1:17:30.125
-Hola.
-Hola. Hello.

1:17:30.208 --> 1:17:31.333
How are you?

1:17:31.416 --> 1:17:33.666
-Nice dress.
-You look great.

1:17:33.708 --> 1:17:36.041
-Wanna try the paella?
-Okay.

1:17:36.666 --> 1:17:39.333
-Did you make it? Yes?
-Yes.

1:17:39.416 --> 1:17:41.166
Mmm!

1:17:41.250 --> 1:17:43.500
-<i>¿Caliente?</i>
-He's a film director, right?

1:17:43.583 --> 1:17:47.000
This is really good. <i>¡Buena, buena!</i>

1:18:04.208 --> 1:18:06.958
-I don't like it.
-You don't like the pecorino?

1:18:07.041 --> 1:18:10.000
Cheers!

1:18:10.958 --> 1:18:12.125
To Italian cinema.

1:18:12.708 --> 1:18:14.833
Did you tell him
about your dissertation? No?

1:18:14.916 --> 1:18:16.708
-No.
-Yeah.

1:18:20.708 --> 1:18:21.916
This is sweet.

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.291
Like really sweet.

1:18:24.375 --> 1:18:25.541
One more.

1:18:26.750 --> 1:18:29.083
-Everything.
-Everything. Everything.

1:18:30.375 --> 1:18:32.916
-Why don't we toast?
<i>-Salud!</i>

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.166
Cheers!

1:18:36.750 --> 1:18:40.125
The paella, forget it.
We have the spaghetti.

1:18:46.583 --> 1:18:49.166
Oh, that's so sweet of her.

1:19:01.166 --> 1:19:02.000
Well…

1:19:02.083 --> 1:19:03.500
I'm sad for you

1:19:03.583 --> 1:19:08.500
because Seville has
the most beautiful girls in Spain.

1:19:09.541 --> 1:19:11.166
You should come with me.

1:19:13.041 --> 1:19:15.666
You know, I pretty sure
I don't need to go to Seville.

1:19:15.750 --> 1:19:17.041
-Ah, no?
-No.

1:19:17.541 --> 1:19:18.958
Why?

1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:23.416
Because the most beautiful girl
of all the beautiful girls is…

1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:24.750
…in front of me.

1:19:24.833 --> 1:19:26.458
I don't get it.

1:19:26.541 --> 1:19:27.666
No?

1:19:28.250 --> 1:19:29.208
No.

1:19:30.875 --> 1:19:33.416
You get it.

1:19:33.500 --> 1:19:34.750
At this point,

1:19:34.833 --> 1:19:38.500
I should
maybe send the comic to a publisher,

1:19:38.583 --> 1:19:41.958
and… and they should publish it.

1:19:42.041 --> 1:19:44.500
-That's great!
-Well, yeah, it would be really cool.

1:19:44.583 --> 1:19:47.500
And then, if it happens,

1:19:47.583 --> 1:19:49.916
maybe I'll put a dedication to you
on the front page.

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000
The front page--
the page where the dedications go.

1:19:52.083 --> 1:19:54.291
It could be the first,
or it could be the last.

1:19:54.375 --> 1:19:57.833
-Mom, Dad, Rebecca.
-Well, thank you.

1:19:57.916 --> 1:19:59.708
No. No problem.

1:20:00.833 --> 1:20:02.541
Can I ask you a personal question?

1:20:03.125 --> 1:20:04.416
-Sure thing.
-Hmm?

1:20:04.500 --> 1:20:06.000
Hmm.

1:20:08.125 --> 1:20:10.500
What's with this beard, huh?

1:20:10.583 --> 1:20:12.583
Because he thinks
he's more manly like that.

1:20:12.666 --> 1:20:14.750
You know, a fragile, insecure personality.

1:20:14.833 --> 1:20:16.958
Jack is right, you know?

1:20:17.041 --> 1:20:19.291
I think
a smooth face in a man is,

1:20:19.375 --> 1:20:20.333
how can I put it?

1:20:20.416 --> 1:20:22.041
-Very…
-Very manly?

1:20:22.125 --> 1:20:23.083
Yeah.

1:20:23.166 --> 1:20:25.666
You take the <i>palabras</i>
right out of my mouth, Amanda.

1:20:25.750 --> 1:20:26.916
What an idiot!

1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:28.958
Have any weed
in your apartment?

1:20:29.041 --> 1:20:31.333
Actually, I don't know
if we have any weed leftover.

1:20:31.416 --> 1:20:33.875
I mean, if we have any,
it's in the bathroom. Amanda, go check.

1:20:33.958 --> 1:20:36.375
<i>Vamos. </i>I'll go with you.

1:21:14.125 --> 1:21:15.375
I won't be long.

1:21:58.500 --> 1:22:00.791
Interested in seeing something
I've never shown anyone?

1:22:01.375 --> 1:22:02.375
Of course.

1:22:03.083 --> 1:22:04.666
I have it at my place, if…

1:22:05.541 --> 1:22:08.083
Yeah, yeah, of course. Please, get it.

1:22:08.166 --> 1:22:10.583
And since you're going,
you might as well bring back some weed.

1:22:10.666 --> 1:22:13.625
If we wait any longer for these two
in the bathroom, we'll be here all night.

1:22:13.708 --> 1:22:15.666
-I'm going.
-Oh, wait a second.

1:22:27.333 --> 1:22:28.416
Don't take too long.

1:22:30.416 --> 1:22:32.125
Yeah.

1:22:53.541 --> 1:22:56.708
So, you want to take me
to live on a Brazilian island

1:22:56.791 --> 1:22:58.791
where your brother Paolo is.

1:22:59.541 --> 1:23:01.000
He has a lot of money.

1:23:02.958 --> 1:23:05.833
But I still don't understand. What do…

1:23:05.916 --> 1:23:09.958
-…you do for a living?
-Um, it's a bit difficult to explain.

1:23:10.041 --> 1:23:11.500
You know, I deal with…

1:23:11.583 --> 1:23:14.166
…apartments, public venues…

1:23:14.250 --> 1:23:15.250
…and banks.

1:23:15.333 --> 1:23:17.375
Yeah, okay, but what do you do?

1:23:17.458 --> 1:23:21.458
I mean, are you, like,
a bricklayer, an engineer?

1:23:21.541 --> 1:23:23.041
Uh, I don't know.

1:23:23.125 --> 1:23:25.500
-An architect?
-I'm a thief.

1:23:25.583 --> 1:23:26.750
-Oh.
-Hmm.

1:23:26.833 --> 1:23:28.333
That's why you have this.

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:32.166
If you're so mysterious,
it means you must be a cleaning guy.

1:23:32.250 --> 1:23:35.125
Hmm. In a way, you're correct.

1:23:36.541 --> 1:23:38.250
Where's Ludovico?
Still downstairs?

1:23:38.333 --> 1:23:41.250
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
he was totally drunk.

1:23:41.333 --> 1:23:43.708
-Maybe he got lost on the stairs.
-Hmm.

1:23:43.791 --> 1:23:45.916
-Come on, go fetch him.
-I'll go.

1:23:48.083 --> 1:23:49.833
If I can find my way.

1:23:49.916 --> 1:23:51.666
The wine was a bit strong.

1:23:54.250 --> 1:23:55.291
Brazil.

1:23:59.208 --> 1:24:00.416
Hey, Ludovico.

1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:03.416
What other paranoia
has come over you now?

1:24:04.125 --> 1:24:05.791
Look, I--

1:24:05.875 --> 1:24:07.708
-Hey.
-Were you looking for your little friend?

1:24:21.375 --> 1:24:22.666
Go and sit there.

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.375
Good boy. Crawl.

1:24:35.416 --> 1:24:38.833
Leave him alone.
He's got fuck-all to do with this.

1:24:41.541 --> 1:24:43.666
You wanted to go to Brazil with my money

1:24:43.750 --> 1:24:45.791
just to identify the remains
of your junkie brother

1:24:45.875 --> 1:24:47.375
who was murdered and thrown in the sea.

1:24:47.458 --> 1:24:49.333
Piece of shit.
Don't you dare mention my brother!

1:24:56.333 --> 1:24:58.500
Two unfortunate orphans.

1:24:58.583 --> 1:25:00.250
Both of them faced a brutal end.

1:25:00.833 --> 1:25:02.541
Actually, we can make it three
with this one.

1:25:02.625 --> 1:25:05.666
I told you. He's got nothing
to do with it. You only have to kill me.

1:25:05.750 --> 1:25:09.208
How generous of you.
But he's seen my face already.

1:25:09.291 --> 1:25:12.875
Really, it's too bad. Dreams die at dawn.

1:25:12.958 --> 1:25:14.375
Freeze.

1:25:14.458 --> 1:25:16.791
Lower your arm.

1:25:17.625 --> 1:25:18.541
Slowly.

1:25:19.916 --> 1:25:21.083
Drop the gun.

1:25:23.083 --> 1:25:25.750
Now get down on the floor,
you worthless piece of shit.

1:25:32.666 --> 1:25:34.458
Buzzetti was right.

1:25:34.541 --> 1:25:37.375
I should have ordered him to kill you,
not Marzio.

1:25:44.750 --> 1:25:45.916
That was for Mario.

1:25:54.125 --> 1:25:57.333
That one was for Marzio.

1:25:57.416 --> 1:25:58.708
I promised him, you know?

1:25:59.458 --> 1:26:03.041
When you ordered that fucking psychopath
to slit his throat like a pig.

1:26:03.125 --> 1:26:05.750
He'll get what's coming to him soon.

1:26:05.833 --> 1:26:08.750
You don't believe in destiny, huh?

1:26:08.833 --> 1:26:10.500
Well, now I'm your destiny.

1:26:11.083 --> 1:26:13.833
And believe me when I tell you
I'm gonna kill you one piece at a time.

1:26:16.541 --> 1:26:19.500
It's too bad
you only have two knees, Caino.

1:26:19.583 --> 1:26:22.875
I… I can have them reconstructed.

1:26:23.958 --> 1:26:26.541
But you're not gonna find another brain.

1:26:36.166 --> 1:26:40.333
He wanted… He wanted to shoot me
in the face, that piece of shit!

1:26:40.416 --> 1:26:43.875
Cut his balls off
and stick them in his mouth!

1:26:43.958 --> 1:26:45.625
He has to be found like that.

1:26:45.708 --> 1:26:47.250
Whoever steals from Caino--

1:27:28.166 --> 1:27:29.416
Ludovico, hey.

1:27:32.041 --> 1:27:36.250
-It hurts.
-Shh!

1:27:36.333 --> 1:27:38.916
The ambulance is coming.
Yeah, the ambulance is coming.

1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.833
-The ambulance is coming.
-It hurts.

1:27:45.750 --> 1:27:48.916
-It hurts.
-I know. Okay.

1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.583
Shh!

1:27:51.666 --> 1:27:54.208
I'll call the amb--

1:27:54.291 --> 1:27:55.208
Help!

1:27:57.166 --> 1:27:58.083
Help!

1:27:59.541 --> 1:28:00.541
It's my fault.

1:28:01.125 --> 1:28:02.833
Shh! Shh!

1:28:02.916 --> 1:28:05.541
Oh! No.

1:28:16.125 --> 1:28:18.541
Oh, please, no.

1:28:21.458 --> 1:28:23.041
I'll come back for you.

1:28:23.125 --> 1:28:25.708
I'll come back for you, okay?

1:30:22.791 --> 1:30:26.541
How the fuck do you always manage
to speak about politics, huh?

1:30:26.625 --> 1:30:29.041
We're a country of thieves.

1:30:29.125 --> 1:30:32.208
With tax evasion in the hundreds of
billions, you wonder why I bring it up?

1:30:32.291 --> 1:30:35.375
Yeah, but we elect new people
to do something about it, didn't we?

1:30:35.458 --> 1:30:38.041
"Italians first." First in what?

1:30:38.125 --> 1:30:39.958
We're the first to steal.

1:30:40.041 --> 1:30:41.208
We're so full of shit.

1:30:41.291 --> 1:30:43.875
Yeah, okay, I get it.
But come on, gimme a break, man.

1:30:43.958 --> 1:30:45.625
Jesus fucking Christ!

1:30:46.375 --> 1:30:48.791
Whoa, who the fuck is this?
Hey, come here!

1:30:48.875 --> 1:30:51.166
He must be completely drunk.

1:30:52.666 --> 1:30:54.916
I think he overdosed.
He's in pretty rough shape.

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:57.000
He's even covered in blood.

1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:01.166
He doesn't look good at all.

1:31:02.458 --> 1:31:04.041
And what's in here?

1:31:04.625 --> 1:31:06.875
-This bag is full of money.
-Is this fake?

1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:10.625
What? Fake?
Shit, this is real money.

1:31:10.708 --> 1:31:12.958
What's this?
Just throw this away and take the money.

1:31:14.250 --> 1:31:16.458
-Hey, let go!
-Let go of the bag. Asshole!

1:31:16.541 --> 1:31:18.083
Go, go, go, go!

1:31:46.875 --> 1:31:50.875
TO MY BIG BROTHER JACK,
WHO GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK
