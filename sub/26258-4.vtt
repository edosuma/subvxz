WEBVTT

00:09.218 --> 00:10.677
Ba-bum.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.222
[croaks]

00:14.681 --> 00:15.891
[panting]

00:17.518 --> 00:19.978
[Viren] <i>Previously on</i> The Dragon Prince...

00:21.688 --> 00:23.398
Boys!

00:23.482 --> 00:27.236
You're going on a trip
to the Banther Lodge.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.322
-[growling]
<i>-Aspiro.</i>

00:32.157 --> 00:33.492
You just did magic.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.994
-[Rayla] You're a mage.
-Wow!

00:36.078 --> 00:37.704
I'm a mage!

00:38.121 --> 00:42.000
[Viren] <i>Moonshadow elves are dangerous,</i>
<i>elite fighters.</i>

00:42.084 --> 00:45.420
They will find you,
and they will kill you.

00:45.754 --> 00:46.964
It's up to us now.

00:47.047 --> 00:51.134
We have to return this egg
to keep it safe and carry it to Xadia.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.469
And find its mother.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.304
We could make a difference.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.556
Just the three of us.

00:55.639 --> 00:57.558
-[grunts]
-[Callum] Four of us.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.894
[theme music playing]

01:16.285 --> 01:17.578
[roaring]

01:45.897 --> 01:47.065
[grunting]

01:50.777 --> 01:52.070
Unbind yourself!

01:52.863 --> 01:54.281
Unbind... thyself.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.034
<i>Unbindo!</i>

01:57.117 --> 01:58.201
[sighs]

02:01.288 --> 02:02.247
[grunts]

02:02.331 --> 02:03.790
Don't judge me.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.627
So what, I'm talking to my ribbon-thing?

02:06.710 --> 02:09.504
How is that any worse than talking to a...

02:09.588 --> 02:11.715
whatever it is you are?

02:17.012 --> 02:18.889
[growls]

02:20.891 --> 02:22.267
Ugh!

02:23.393 --> 02:25.145
[bell tolling]

02:36.114 --> 02:38.116
[tolling continues]

03:10.607 --> 03:13.610
A funeral so soon is madness.

03:13.693 --> 03:18.031
It is tradition to mourn fallen kings
for seven sunsets.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.866
You've not even given him one.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.245
I understand your concern, Opeli,

03:23.328 --> 03:26.790
but in a time of war,
we must move forward.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.055
[yawns]

03:43.598 --> 03:45.726
Hey, keep your head up.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.477
Ugh, sorry.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.355
[grunts] Long night.

03:51.815 --> 03:52.899
[Claudia] Drink this.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.903
I call it "hot brown morning potion."

04:02.868 --> 04:04.870
[laughs] That's good!

04:14.045 --> 04:15.922
[indistinct murmuring]

04:21.178 --> 04:24.681
Today we woke to a devastating truth.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.850
Our king has been taken from us.

04:26.933 --> 04:27.934
[crowd gasping]

04:28.018 --> 04:33.356
Slain by the forces of Xadia,
vile Moonshadow elves.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.029
To me, he was more than a king.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.949
In his final hours, Harrow called me...

04:43.950 --> 04:45.035
his brother.

04:45.744 --> 04:46.703
[Opeli] Wait.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.956
Where are the princes?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.500
They need to be here.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.002
The princes...

04:54.836 --> 04:55.837
are dead.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.088
[crowd exclaiming]

04:57.172 --> 05:00.634
We cannot let Xadia's cruelty
go unanswered.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.053
We must move forward with strength.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.888
Light the pyre.

05:07.891 --> 05:08.892
No.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.358
[sighs] Claudia.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.874
[chanting]

05:50.934 --> 05:52.352
[crowd gasping]

05:52.435 --> 05:57.482
When a ruler of Katolis dies,
we mourn for seven days.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.526
But we are at war.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.696
Today, we must mourn sevenfold...

06:03.238 --> 06:07.909
for tonight, there will be a coronation.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.385
[Rayla] Callum. Callum. Hey!

06:25.468 --> 06:27.262
That's your name, right? Callum?

06:27.762 --> 06:30.682
-Clem? Or was it Camel?
-Uh, it's Callum.

06:31.474 --> 06:35.103
I guess I was just distracted trying
to draw this... prima-ball.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.188
-Primal Stone.
-Right.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.941
It holds the pure essence
of a primal spirit inside.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.944
-[sighs] Primal Source?
-Right.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.196
You do know
what the Six Primal Sources are?

06:45.280 --> 06:48.742
Uh, if I say yes,
are you gonna make me name them?

06:48.825 --> 06:49.784
[Rayla] Ugh.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.624
All magic in the world
comes from the Primal Sources.

06:55.707 --> 06:59.461
They're the original and purest forms
of magical energy.

06:59.544 --> 07:05.050
The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Earth,
the Ocean, and...

07:06.301 --> 07:08.094
-The Sky.
-Yes.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.514
To cast a spell,
a mage needs Primal Energy.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.308
So that wind breath spell you did?

07:13.975 --> 07:16.728
You'd usually need a storm
or at least a strong breeze.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.521
But with that stone,

07:18.605 --> 07:22.359
you have all the power of the Sky,
any time.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.737
-Wow.
-Primal Stones are incredibly rare.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.950
They've been sought after by the most
powerful arch-mages in history.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.827
And now, somehow you have one.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.750
Wait, I... I've seen these before.
At the Banther Lodge.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.712
There was this little cube thing
and it had these exact symbols on it.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.798
Uh, neat.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.133
What if it's magic? We have to go get it.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.887
Wait, what?
We have real problems to worry about.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.849
Ending the war.
Taking the dragon egg to Xadia. Remember?

07:54.933 --> 07:59.270
Xadia's to the east, right?
So is the lodge. It's on the way.

07:59.354 --> 08:03.024
Oh, great. I'm sure
it won't be crawling with humans.

08:03.108 --> 08:07.278
Humans that are looking for you
and want to kill me! Yay!

08:07.362 --> 08:11.741
No, it's the winter lodge.
It's been empty for months. Trust me.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.787
[sighs] Look... Rayla.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.416
Princes are supposed to be good at things.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.253
Uh, sword fighting, leadership...
riding horses.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.465
But I've always been kind of bad at,
well, everything.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.676
So, when I tried that spell,

08:29.759 --> 08:33.888
I was sure I'd end up on fire
or covered in spiders...

08:33.972 --> 08:35.098
but it worked.

08:36.224 --> 08:41.104
And then you called me a mage,
and that felt... right.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.983
I... I just have this feeling
that cube thing could help me.

08:45.900 --> 08:46.818
[Ezran] Callum?

08:47.777 --> 08:48.945
[yawns]

08:49.696 --> 08:51.239
I had a weird dream.

08:52.407 --> 08:54.993
It wasn't a dream, Ez.
All of that was real.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.661
Are you sure?

08:56.745 --> 09:01.708
There was this giant pink hippopotamus
and I pulled its ear off.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.251
Because it was made of taffy.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.628
Uh... no. That... that was a dream.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.338
I thought you meant the elves,

09:07.422 --> 09:09.799
the smoke wolves, the dragon egg.
That was all real.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.260
Then I tried to thank the hippo
for the taffy,

09:12.802 --> 09:15.930
but he couldn't hear me,
because I was eating his ears.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.932
[Rayla] Hey, sad prince.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.102
[sighs] Let's go get your cube.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.271
-Really?
-[Rayla] Yes.

09:23.354 --> 09:28.777
Just, please, no more detours, all right?
Or heartfelt speeches.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.870
-Hey, guys? Can we--
-We're not stopping yet.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.330
-But I'm--
-No snacks.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.290
I was gonna say thirsty.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.875
Fine. Drink this.

09:46.211 --> 09:50.548
Uh, no, thank you. We don't drink... that.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.717
-What?
-Blood.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.094
We don't drink blood.

09:54.177 --> 09:57.472
We don't mean to be rude,
but, uh, you can keep it.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.099
It's moonberry juice.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.435
[sniffs]

10:04.145 --> 10:08.066
[scoffs] Is that what humans think we are?
Bloodthirsty monsters?

10:08.149 --> 10:09.776
No, no, no. It... it's not that.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.697
I mean, I... I have heard stories, but...
but I'm sure they're just stories.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.159
Horrible, awful stories.
Oh, look at that, we're here.

10:24.666 --> 10:28.920
See? No winter,
no humans at the winter lodge.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.089
Let's just make this quick.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.508
Tell me where the thing is,
and I'll be in and out.

10:35.176 --> 10:40.265
Okay, so this is the game room.
Cube should be in there.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.543
Like I said, no winter, no humans. Right?

11:08.626 --> 11:11.921
Yeah, but it is kind of weird
there's no one here...

11:12.463 --> 11:14.883
since this is where Dad was sending us.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.552
[horn sounding]

11:18.553 --> 11:19.929
[horses neighing]

11:20.013 --> 11:22.390
Yeah, we probably
shouldn't have come here.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.126
Aunt Amaya?

11:53.338 --> 11:54.797
[Callum and Ezran groan]

11:57.634 --> 11:59.302
I'm so glad you're safe.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.970
[stammers] Extremely safe!

12:01.054 --> 12:03.389
Safe and... alone! [chuckles nervously]

12:15.193 --> 12:17.111
Oh, uh, that door's locked.

12:17.195 --> 12:21.032
So, uh, you wait here for a minute,
couple minutes, few...

12:21.115 --> 12:22.992
However long it takes. I'll go find a key.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.916
I don't believe in locks.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.716
[Gren] Someone's here.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.469
What? No, no.

12:42.053 --> 12:45.014
No one here but us and all your
[shouting] human troops!

12:46.307 --> 12:48.726
Callum, you know it doesn't help to yell.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.522
And why are you saying
"human troops" like that?

12:52.605 --> 12:54.148
Uh, what do you mean?

12:54.232 --> 12:57.610
That's how I always say
[shouting] "heavily-armed human troops!"

12:57.694 --> 12:59.028
[laughs nervously]

13:17.797 --> 13:20.925
Uh, Ezran has something to tell you.

13:21.467 --> 13:25.179
Um, I... skipped breakfast.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.223
I'm sorry.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.813
[Gren] Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.157
[Gren] The food here is...

13:44.240 --> 13:45.408
[bangs loudly]

13:46.409 --> 13:47.910
...weapons-grade.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.375
Dig in.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.046
Aunt Amaya, why are you here?

13:59.297 --> 14:01.883
I received a messenger bird
from the king yesterday.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.889
The most important things,
I've written down.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.432
A letter?

14:11.476 --> 14:13.061
-[Gren] What's wrong?
-I just...

14:13.144 --> 14:16.564
He gave me a letter, too,
but I must have dropped it somewhere.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.815
What'd your letter say?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.903
"General, the castle is under threat.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.573
Assassins have infiltrated the kingdom.
Moonshadow elves."

14:26.532 --> 14:27.950
The worst kind.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.244
-"Do not bring your force to the castle."
-[Ezran grunts]

14:30.328 --> 14:33.206
"Your orders are to proceed immediately
to the Banther Lodge.

14:33.289 --> 14:37.794
Callum and Ezran will be there. Above all,
see to it that my sons are safe."

14:38.795 --> 14:40.963
Wait, there's more on the back.

14:42.131 --> 14:46.552
"PS: Once their safety is assured,
the boys may wish to build a dirt man."

14:47.720 --> 14:49.472
We do not wish to build a dirt man.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.057
We do not.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.434
You're safe now, boys.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.230
[crunching sharply]

15:11.119 --> 15:14.664
[sighs] This is all my fault.
We should have never come here.

15:14.747 --> 15:18.000
But we found Aunt Amaya.
Maybe we should tell her, Callum.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.335
Tell her what?

15:19.419 --> 15:22.213
About the egg... and Rayla.

15:22.296 --> 15:26.092
We can't. Didn't you hear what she said?
How she talked about elves?

15:26.676 --> 15:28.636
To Aunt Amaya, elves are monsters.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.930
-But if we just explain everything--
-[Bait vomits]

15:31.013 --> 15:34.642
It won't work.
Humans and elves don't trust each other.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.563
That won't change
until we take this egg back to Xadia.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.774
We have to find Rayla and get out of here.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.739
[imitating Callum]
"It's the winter lodge, Rayla.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.241
No winter, no humans." [scoffs]

16:37.330 --> 16:38.331
[sighs]

16:39.040 --> 16:40.333
"It's okay."

16:55.181 --> 16:56.432
Huh.

17:00.603 --> 17:01.521
[gasps]

17:27.838 --> 17:29.048
[straining]

17:29.632 --> 17:31.133
-[door opens]
-General Amaya!

17:31.217 --> 17:32.677
The princes have disappeared.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.440
[groaning]

17:50.695 --> 17:51.696
[Gren] How did you do it?

17:53.155 --> 17:54.448
How did we do what?

17:55.700 --> 17:58.327
"We"? How many of you are there?

17:58.411 --> 17:59.912
Did I say "we"?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.081
[Gren] Don't look away from me.

18:02.164 --> 18:05.001
It's just me. I'm alone.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.586
[Gren] Liar.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.591
If there are more of them,
the princes are in danger.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.301
Do not take your eyes off her.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.559
[guard yelps]

18:21.642 --> 18:24.687
Careful with those.
Wouldn't want to lose a finger.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.608
I mean, can you imagine going through life
with only four fingers?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.029
[faint rumbling]

18:34.196 --> 18:36.991
This is one of your weirdest ideas.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.743
Weirder than snail armor?

18:38.826 --> 18:41.203
Ez, snails already have armor.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.081
-Then why do they keep getting smooshed?
-We're not... [grunts]

18:44.165 --> 18:46.626
My point is,
I don't know if this plan'll work.

18:46.709 --> 18:47.710
She'll know what to do.

18:52.715 --> 18:56.886
Have you met Bait?
Say hello to my little friend.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.680
[grunts]

19:12.401 --> 19:13.444
Thanks!

19:20.076 --> 19:21.160
[croaks]

19:23.954 --> 19:25.247
[Rayla] Come on!

19:41.555 --> 19:45.393
[Gren] Stop right there, elf.
Callum, Ezran, come here.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.606
Callum, we should just tell her.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.067
Boys, get away from her.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.030
Wait!

20:04.453 --> 20:06.205
What are you saying?

20:06.288 --> 20:11.544
He says, if we don't let you go,
you'll kill them and drink their blood.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.131
That you are a monster.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.844
Right, so you have to let us go.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.014
[Gren] It's okay, Callum.
I've slain monsters before.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.683
Do it. Take her out.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.145
[grunts]

20:38.362 --> 20:40.781
Go ahead, take another shot.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.368
But read my lips.

20:44.452 --> 20:48.873
The next time I swing my blade,
I'll end both of them in half a second.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.757
-Move, humans.
-Ow!

21:00.134 --> 21:01.719
[unconvincingly] Ow...

21:05.931 --> 21:07.266
[Rayla] What now?

21:08.225 --> 21:09.977
Ugh. I don't think a boat--

21:10.060 --> 21:11.353
[Callum] Just get in.

21:23.491 --> 21:28.120
If the elf realizes we followed them,
she'll take the princes' lives.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.997
We need to be careful.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.374
Corvus!

21:35.586 --> 21:37.963
Track them, but stay out of sight.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.508
And when you see an opportunity,
free them.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.637
The rest of you, ride with me.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.566
[sighs] That worked. I can't believe it.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.736
I can't believe you're such a jerk.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.614
What? What's wrong?

22:03.697 --> 22:08.202
You called me a bloodthirsty monster.
You have no idea how that feels.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.579
But I don't actually believe any of that.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.040
I was just trying to scare her.
I thought she'd back down.

22:13.123 --> 22:16.126
Oh, that went well. They tried to kill me.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.588
I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant to happen.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.881
Well, it did.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.342
[Callum] You found it?

22:23.425 --> 22:27.346
[Rayla] It's a toy.
Probably a piece from a children's game.

22:28.055 --> 22:32.768
I hope it was worth it to you,
putting everyone's lives in danger.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.537
It's almost time, Father. Crown time.

22:52.162 --> 22:56.041
Or, as I like to call it, the Crown Hour.
Crown o'clock?

22:56.125 --> 22:58.669
[sighs] Thank you. That will be all.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.428
No song for the occasion? Hmm?

23:19.064 --> 23:24.403
People of Katolis,
King Harrow's death has wounded us deeply,

23:24.486 --> 23:30.117
but the loss of his sons, our princes,
is a greater injustice.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.995
By taking the heirs to the throne,

23:33.078 --> 23:36.915
our enemies sought to leave us
without a leader.

23:36.999 --> 23:41.837
It would disgrace Harrow's memory
to allow the kingdom he loved

23:41.920 --> 23:43.881
to be lost in darkness.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.092
Though it is a heavy burden,

23:47.176 --> 23:51.472
I will humbly take up the battle
in Harrow's name.

23:52.097 --> 23:56.435
I will become Lord Protector of the realm.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.063
[indistinct chatter]

24:10.366 --> 24:11.283
[horn sounding]

24:11.867 --> 24:13.327
[Gren] Stop!

24:15.329 --> 24:17.081
[horse whinnies]

24:17.998 --> 24:21.251
[Gren] Stop the coronation!
The princes are alive!
