38:44.723 --> 38:47.726
He did have a choice.
He didn't get his choice.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.596
Because we live in America.
And America is a democracy.

38:50.596 --> 38:54.199
And three of us agreed.
There was one act this season,

38:54.199 --> 38:57.812

39:04.643 --> 39:10.682
We said if this act could come
back and torture Simon.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.584
- Near death.

39:37.376 --> 39:40.412
- Ha‐ha.

I love both of you guys.
I am sorry already to the one I

voices blended together, Nikki,

40:57.222 --> 40:57.812
