Pick up... chicken breasts.

00:02.538 --> 00:05.808
The way I know you want it,
with the bone in.

00:07.327 --> 00:08.727
We really should
hold a seminar

00:08.729 --> 00:10.712
about sexual harassment
in the workplace.

00:10.714 --> 00:12.932
Why? He's already
so good at it.

00:12.934 --> 00:14.149
I'm serious.
How'd he like it

00:14.151 --> 00:15.901
if we did that to him
every time we ordered?

00:15.903 --> 00:17.552
Well,
let's find out.

00:17.554 --> 00:18.821

One pastrami.

00:20.724 --> 00:22.274
Can you do me a favor,
doll-face?

00:22.276 --> 00:24.893
Make it so big and thick, you
can't get your mouth around it.

00:24.895 --> 00:27.112
Can you do that
for me?

00:27.114 --> 00:29.832
Yes,
and two matzo ball soups,

00:29.834 --> 00:31.000
hold the balls.

00:31.002 --> 00:32.750
Wait,
I'll hold the balls,

00:32.753 --> 00:34.787

and look pretty.

00:34.789 --> 00:38.257
And a cream of...

00:38.259 --> 00:41.343
nope, can't.
Just grossed myself out.

00:58.044 --> 00:59.394
Max, come out.

00:59.396 --> 01:01.313
If I came out,
it would not be for you,

01:01.315 --> 01:04.149
it's be for that
hot <i>dragon tattoo</i> girl.

01:04.150 --> 01:06.701
Welcome, board members,
to the very first

01:06.703 --> 01:09.571
financial assessment meeting
of Max's homemade cupcakes.

01:09.573 --> 01:12.607
I was told
there would be a cheese plate.

01:12.609 --> 01:14.125
After five months
in business,

01:14.127 --> 01:16.878
we're showing a profit
of $725.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.780
I have to say,
I'm a little disappointed.

01:18.782 --> 01:21.333
Really? 'Cause, dude,
we have so far exceeded

01:21.335 --> 01:23.134
where I thought we'd be
in five months.

01:23.136 --> 01:25.286
Look, we have to find a way
to make more money on the side

01:25.288 --> 01:26.588
to put into the business.

01:26.590 --> 01:28.757
Or we could quit now,
while we're a success.

01:28.759 --> 01:30.124
What are you
talking about?

01:30.126 --> 01:31.593
It's only
gonna get worse.

01:31.595 --> 01:34.563
Or it could get better.
Why would you even say that?

01:34.565 --> 01:37.265
Because it's life, and life
gets worse, that's what it does.

01:37.267 --> 01:39.851
On life's resume,
under special skills it says,

01:39.853 --> 01:41.937
"good at
making things worse."

01:41.939 --> 01:44.105
- Do you always go to
the worst-case scenario?

01:44.107 --> 01:45.991
Yup.
On my resume it says,

01:45.993 --> 01:48.326
"good at going to
the worst case scenario."

01:48.328 --> 01:50.445
Do you think you could try
to be more optimistic,

01:50.447 --> 01:52.113
and not expect the worst
all the time?

01:52.115 --> 01:53.248
[Banging at the door]

01:53.250 --> 01:55.617
Who's that?
More optimistic, right?

01:55.619 --> 01:59.087
On the other side of that door
is all the money you lost,

01:59.089 --> 02:00.822
and then we move back
into your townhouse,

02:00.824 --> 02:04.009
and I masturbate in your tub
for a change.

02:08.931 --> 02:11.550
It was twice,
and you could have knocked.

02:13.553 --> 02:14.786
Who is it?

02:14.788 --> 02:16.671

02:22.328 --> 02:24.563
Sorry to bother you, miss.
Do you live in this apartment?

Sorry, officer,
it's her first raid.

didn't send me.

- What do you know about

02:37.794 --> 02:39.527
the tenant who lives in the
apartment directly above you?

02:39.529 --> 02:40.879
His name is Lou.

a more positive spin on things.

Where are you going
with that?

That's my good China

03:18.619 --> 03:20.401
I'm making
a "hello" cupcake plate

03:20.403 --> 03:21.670
for our neighbors
across the hall.

03:21.672 --> 03:22.921
Oh, no, you're not.

03:22.923 --> 03:24.956
It's weird
not to know your neighbors.

03:24.958 --> 03:26.341
No, it's weird
not to know your father,

03:26.343 --> 03:30.095
but by the time you're four,
you get over it and move on.

03:30.097 --> 03:31.763
This is a mistake.

03:31.765 --> 03:33.515
Who knows what's lurking
behind that door?

03:33.517 --> 03:35.717
Yes, something awful,
like nice people,

03:35.719 --> 03:37.585
who might look out for us,
or say, "hello," in the hallway

03:37.587 --> 03:38.586
when they see you.

03:38.588 --> 03:39.971
No matter what
comes out of there,

03:39.973 --> 03:42.757
I will not be "hello-ing" it up
in the hallway.

through the floor into my ears.

across the hall,

you might have
opened a portal to hell.

to walk and play music.

of apartment knowledge

to piss me off.

10:04.702 --> 10:07.503
Never took off my clothes,
'cause soldiers don't.

We have to be ready
when the enemy attacks.

10:09.673 --> 10:12.657
Okay, you were right,
I was wrong.

10:12.659 --> 10:14.159
Why do you have the broom?

10:14.161 --> 10:15.928
'Cause I ran out
of finger bullets.

10:15.930 --> 10:18.047
Wait, you're gonna fall.

I mean "you."

with a tube of chanel?

She would have made
terrible prostitute.

20:23.485 --> 20:24.768
That's a nice TV.

20:24.770 --> 20:26.653
- Yeah, brand-new.

20:26.655 --> 20:28.438
I have all my girls over
the other night

20:28.440 --> 20:30.690
for viewing sleepover party.

20:30.692 --> 20:32.308
It's also 3-d.

20:32.310 --> 20:34.327
- Does it come with
3-d glasses?

20:34.329 --> 20:36.580
Yeah,

It's 3-d glasses.

Oh, so cool.

20:49.628 --> 20:52.262
This swing
is a brilliant idea.

20:52.264 --> 20:55.632
Yeah, it's for my porch
at lake house.

20:55.634 --> 20:57.467
But why wait?

20:57.469 --> 21:00.303
