00:00.531 --> 00:01.963
<i>The National Weather Service</i>

00:02.032 --> 00:03.432
<i>has issued a heightened tornado watch.</i>

00:03.500 --> 00:05.000
Everybody stay inside!

00:05.069 --> 00:07.335
<i>We are gonna lock this place down!</i>

00:07.404 --> 00:09.604
<i>Dear lord Jesus, in your
infinite power and compassion,</i>

00:09.673 --> 00:11.006
please save us!

00:11.075 --> 00:12.674
I love you, Jeff! I didn't want to die

00:12.743 --> 00:14.076
without letting you know how I feel!

00:14.144 --> 00:16.411
Hey! Sandra! Sandra!

00:16.976 --> 00:19.376
Dear Allah, in your
infinite power and compassion,

00:19.423 --> 00:20.956
please save us from destruction.

00:21.025 --> 00:23.125
<i>Thank you for being there for me</i>

00:23.193 --> 00:25.427
and for keeping me calm.

00:25.496 --> 00:26.428
Of course.

00:39.143 --> 00:43.401
I hope you all had an amazing vacation.

00:43.589 --> 00:44.980
By "vacation," you mean the two months

00:45.049 --> 00:46.381
we were laid off without pay?

00:46.450 --> 00:48.216
Uh-huh. Anyways,

00:48.285 --> 00:51.186
I've been doing a lot of soul-searching

00:51.255 --> 00:53.909
- since the tornado, and...
- Coming through!

00:55.025 --> 00:57.092
Almost got me there.
And... and it's been raising

00:57.161 --> 01:00.540
some big questions for me.
Questions like...

01:01.893 --> 01:03.760
Questions that...

01:05.394 --> 01:07.962
Why did the tornado hit us?

01:08.172 --> 01:11.802
And why did it stop
when I prayed to Allah?

01:12.610 --> 01:14.443
- And why...
- Ah!

01:16.413 --> 01:19.214
Sorry. I almost fell.

01:19.283 --> 01:23.518
Does that mean that Allah
is the one true god?

01:23.587 --> 01:27.389
Or that Allah and Jesus
are the same god?

01:27.458 --> 01:31.159
Or... or that they're different gods,

01:31.228 --> 01:34.262
but with varying responsibilities?

01:34.331 --> 01:36.298
What's the meaning of...

01:39.336 --> 01:41.136
What's the...

01:43.674 --> 01:46.475
So that's what I've been thinking about.

01:46.543 --> 01:49.411
Anyone else have thoughts on that?

01:53.445 --> 01:55.717
Okay, then.

01:55.786 --> 01:56.880
Let's get to work!

01:57.655 --> 01:59.888
What was that, a 20-minute walk?

01:59.957 --> 02:01.523
23.

02:01.592 --> 02:04.793
Remember, single file
when we cross the highway.

02:04.862 --> 02:07.863
- Are we cloud one?
- No.

02:12.636 --> 02:14.870
Wow, that's really bad luck.

02:14.938 --> 02:17.439
Yeah, it... well, it wasn't
just my apartment.

02:17.508 --> 02:20.275
The tornado leveled
the whole building, so...

02:20.344 --> 02:23.378
Scary. Were you in it at the time?

02:23.447 --> 02:26.014
No, I was... here, at the time.

02:26.820 --> 02:29.951
Oh, right. Blonde moment.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.820
Yeah, so anyway,
everything I own is gone,

02:31.889 --> 02:33.989
and now I'm... I'm living
in a FEMA trailer.

02:34.058 --> 02:37.225
So in a way, you're officially
trailer trash now?

02:37.294 --> 02:39.961
Well, I am living in a trailer, so...

02:40.030 --> 02:41.134
Ha. Admits it.

02:42.332 --> 02:45.200
Oh. Why don't you move into
Garrett's apartment?

02:45.269 --> 02:46.468
No! No.

02:46.537 --> 02:48.437
I mean... nah.

02:48.512 --> 02:50.473
Jonah doesn't want to live
with a roommate. He's an adult.

02:50.474 --> 02:53.141
Yeah, no. I... I mean,
I... I would, I would love that,

02:53.210 --> 02:55.844
but I would never...
I would never impose.

02:55.913 --> 02:57.713
But I mean, it wouldn't be
a problem. I could do it.

02:57.781 --> 03:00.082
It's just that it's... really cramped.

03:00.150 --> 03:01.550
Sure, sure, yeah.

03:01.618 --> 03:03.852
Oh. I thought you had a two-bedroom.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.521
Ah, okay. Sure, yes,

03:06.590 --> 03:08.557
you know, if you want to get
architectural about it,

03:08.625 --> 03:12.027
then yes, I do have a second bedroom,

03:12.096 --> 03:14.863
but, when you use a wheelchair,
you need multiple bedrooms.

03:14.932 --> 03:15.806
Oh. Why?

03:15.807 --> 03:16.965
Safety.

03:17.034 --> 03:18.744
Excuse me. Gotta go.

03:26.944 --> 03:28.677
Oops. Sorry.

03:42.025 --> 03:43.458
Back at it, huh?

03:43.527 --> 03:46.285
Yeah. Yeah, it's like we never left.

03:48.098 --> 03:50.996
So, uh, how are things at home?

03:51.473 --> 03:52.973
Emma. How's... how's Emma?

03:53.137 --> 03:55.971
Awesome. Yeah, she's starting
high school.

03:56.039 --> 03:59.174
Oh, wow. Uh, that's exciting. Teenager.

03:59.243 --> 04:01.243
- I know. I know, right?
- Look out!

04:01.311 --> 04:02.644
Oh boy.

04:06.283 --> 04:07.155
Uh...

04:07.818 --> 04:11.486
So, we... we never...
talked about the...

04:11.998 --> 04:13.188
Do we have to?

04:13.257 --> 04:15.190
Oh, yeah, no, I mean, I'd rather not,

04:15.266 --> 04:16.255
if you don't need to.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.755
No! I don't. I don't need to.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.221
Great. Yeah, no, I don't need to either.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.457
No, yeah. Same. Same...

04:20.524 --> 04:22.258
Same team. Just, uh, you know.

04:22.327 --> 04:23.860
Didn't want...

04:23.929 --> 04:25.395
Things to be awkward.

04:25.464 --> 04:26.830
- No! Awkward.
- Pfft.

04:26.906 --> 04:28.645
It's not awkward. It's fine. I'm fine.

04:28.661 --> 04:30.208
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You are fine.

04:30.268 --> 04:32.035
I mean fine, like you're...
I am superfine.

04:32.104 --> 04:33.470
- Hey, Marcus!
- Marcus!

04:33.538 --> 04:34.904
Hey, what's going on, buddy?

04:34.973 --> 04:36.539
Just carrying some stuff.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.659
Classic Marcus.

04:39.711 --> 04:40.363
Hang out!

04:40.365 --> 04:41.937
Yeah, I'm glad they hired you back.

04:41.938 --> 04:44.614
Okay. Thanks. I will.

04:45.277 --> 04:46.282
Hey, listen, I've been thinking

04:46.351 --> 04:48.858
we should kick Mateo
out of the friend group.

04:51.390 --> 04:54.024
So, maybe they're the same god,

04:54.092 --> 04:56.459
but with different responsibilities.

04:56.528 --> 04:58.728
<i>- Yes, can we table that?</i>
- Oh, sure.

04:58.805 --> 05:00.438
<i>I just want to make sure
that, construction aside,</i>

05:00.499 --> 05:01.824
<i>you're going to be ready
for the opening.</i>

05:01.825 --> 05:04.668
Oh, don't worry.
I got your email right here.

05:04.736 --> 05:06.469
Uh, we got door prizes,

05:06.538 --> 05:08.104
and Minions for the kids,

05:08.173 --> 05:09.873
and Howie Mandel's coming?

05:09.941 --> 05:11.074
<i>No, not the head of marketing.</i>

05:11.143 --> 05:12.909
<i>The comedian. Same name.</i>

05:12.978 --> 05:16.079
Oh. Well, relax.
I'm not going to let you down.

05:16.148 --> 05:17.614
<i>Good. I'll see you today at 3:00.</i>

05:17.683 --> 05:19.549
Oh. Why're you coming at 3:00?

05:19.618 --> 05:21.117
<i>For the opening.</i>

05:23.355 --> 05:24.554
Uh-huh.

05:24.623 --> 05:26.089
It says, "Bring back the staff"

05:26.158 --> 05:28.291
a week before the grand opening,
on the 28th."

05:28.360 --> 05:29.479
Today's the 28th.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.802
Well, he couldn't be more clear!

05:30.927 --> 05:33.296
Yes! He could've said
"The grand opening,

05:33.365 --> 05:35.460
which is on the 28th."

05:35.476 --> 05:37.801
This makes the 28th
sound like the start date!

05:37.869 --> 05:40.603
"Bring back the staff a week
before the grand opening...

05:40.672 --> 05:42.906
"on the 28th." Yeah, this is confusing.

05:42.974 --> 05:45.722
No! "Bring back the staff
a week before..."

05:45.957 --> 05:47.756
the grand opening on the 28th."

05:47.825 --> 05:50.092
He didn't say it like that.
You're adding emphasis.

05:50.161 --> 05:51.420
Okay, guys. We just need to figure out

05:51.421 --> 05:52.171
what we're going to do.

05:52.172 --> 05:53.662
Or as Dina would put it,

05:53.731 --> 05:54.623
"We need to figure out

05:54.654 --> 05:56.243
<i>what</i> we're <i>gonna</i> do."

05:56.244 --> 05:58.147
Maybe I would.
Maybe I would say it like that.

05:58.148 --> 05:59.968
Yeah, well good luck in radio.

06:05.023 --> 06:06.426
Attention, employee...

06:07.524 --> 06:08.924
Attention. Test. Testing.

06:10.163 --> 06:11.007
Ah, damn it.

06:11.447 --> 06:13.194
Listen up, everybody!

06:13.257 --> 06:16.250
We're opening today
in, like, four hours!

06:16.319 --> 06:19.374
So that means we need to be
ready in, like, four hours!

06:20.030 --> 06:20.807
To be honest,

06:20.909 --> 06:22.427
I don't think we can do that.

06:22.575 --> 06:24.174
Just doesn't seem possible.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.847
It's not something
that can be accomplished.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.567
But that's just my opinion, though.

06:28.635 --> 06:29.988
All right. Peace!

06:31.416 --> 06:33.210
Okay, so we don't have much time,

06:33.217 --> 06:34.476
which means we need to stock the shelves

06:34.477 --> 06:35.691
with the big items first, and...

06:35.692 --> 06:36.534
Wait.

06:36.535 --> 06:38.351
What if we just set up one aisle,

06:38.352 --> 06:39.403
take a picture of it,

06:39.551 --> 06:41.097
blow that bad boy up life-sized,

06:41.099 --> 06:43.790
and then just slap it over
all the other aisles? Boom.

06:43.791 --> 06:45.479
Uh-huh, maybe.

06:45.548 --> 06:47.648
Look, we can always redo stuff tomorrow,

06:47.717 --> 06:50.285
so for now, it's better to do
things fast and bad

06:50.286 --> 06:51.681
than slow and good.

06:51.682 --> 06:54.044
But fast and good is better.

06:54.045 --> 06:54.996
What are you doing?

06:54.997 --> 06:56.704
What? Fast and good is better

06:56.705 --> 06:57.868
than fast and bad.

06:57.869 --> 06:59.585
Yes, but for now,

06:59.586 --> 07:01.645
we're gonna prioritize speed.

07:01.646 --> 07:03.458
Okay. I'm... I'm prioritizing both.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.482
You can't prioritize both!

07:05.483 --> 07:07.264
Forget it. Just make the place

07:07.310 --> 07:09.123
look as good as possible
before Jeff gets here.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.706
Wait. Jeff is coming... today?

07:11.930 --> 07:12.294
Yep.

07:12.794 --> 07:14.804
How about slow and bad?

07:14.805 --> 07:15.624
Ugh.

07:18.814 --> 07:21.387
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:21.451 --> 07:24.710
- What is going on here?
- Oh, I, uh...

07:24.725 --> 07:26.130
I can't shower in the mornings

07:26.160 --> 07:28.013
because Cliff, in the adjoining trailer,

07:28.014 --> 07:29.018
only takes baths.

07:29.221 --> 07:31.959
Well, gotta do what you gotta do.

07:32.066 --> 07:34.862
Yeah. It's... it's just
until I find a place,

07:34.863 --> 07:37.842
or someone who will let me
stay with them, so...

07:40.983 --> 07:43.974
Mm-hmm. Well, I'ma...

07:43.975 --> 07:46.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you do you. Yeah.

07:47.506 --> 07:49.143
- What'd you say?
- Huh?

07:49.306 --> 07:51.312
Oh, I... I thought you said something.

07:51.410 --> 07:52.648
I didn't say anything.

07:53.402 --> 07:54.327
All right.

07:55.785 --> 07:58.752
We are looking for
Minions costumes only.

07:58.820 --> 08:01.454
What in the name of God
is "Lego Ninjago?"

08:01.524 --> 08:02.376
Excuse me.

08:02.377 --> 08:03.689
Just hang on. Uh, we're closed.

08:03.690 --> 08:05.107
You're going to need to
come back at 3:00.

08:05.108 --> 08:07.412
I'm not a customer. I'm Howie.

08:08.974 --> 08:09.817
Mandel.

08:10.326 --> 08:11.592
I was told to be here at 11:00.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.093
Oh, you're working here?

08:13.094 --> 08:14.868
Yeah, kinda.

08:14.937 --> 08:16.605
Oh, damn it. God!

08:17.339 --> 08:18.827
I hate when they don't tell me
about new hires.

08:18.828 --> 08:20.574
Okay, find yourself a
vest and a name tag

08:20.643 --> 08:21.975
and go help Leonard in produce.

08:22.051 --> 08:23.596
Sorry about that.

08:24.232 --> 08:25.798
I'm Howie Mandel.

08:25.813 --> 08:27.767
Yeah, that's fine. Tell payroll.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.698
Vest. Tag. Produce. Go!

08:30.386 --> 08:31.396
What...

08:33.355 --> 08:34.957
"America's Got Talent"?

08:34.958 --> 08:36.875
I don't know what you're asking me.

08:38.524 --> 08:39.655
Okay.

08:39.936 --> 08:40.690
Wow.

08:41.041 --> 08:43.397
Okay, you're going to have to
redo the whole thing.

08:43.466 --> 08:45.399
I'd have to take everything
off the shelf to move it.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.986
Well, then it's a bad day
to be Earl, isn't it?

08:48.537 --> 08:50.170
Don't sigh!

08:50.239 --> 08:51.458
I can hear you sighing!

08:51.459 --> 08:52.396
- Glenn.
- What?

08:52.397 --> 08:54.660
We don't have time
to restock a whole shelf.

08:54.661 --> 08:56.351
Exactly. See, Earl?

08:56.352 --> 08:58.679
Now you've pissed off Amy, too.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.361
Sometimes I think
the whole world's incompetent.

09:01.362 --> 09:03.451
You know what, Glenn? I am so glad

09:03.560 --> 09:05.786
that you finished writing
your speech so quickly,

09:05.855 --> 09:07.988
so that you could be here
to supervise everything.

09:08.087 --> 09:10.127
- My speech?
- Well, yeah, I mean,

09:10.147 --> 09:13.344
obviously you're going to have
to speak at the ribbon cutting.

09:14.163 --> 09:15.629
Obviously.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.131
Don't worry! We'll do
the best we can without you.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.666
Leave the shelf where it is.

09:19.735 --> 09:21.255
Not today, Earl.

09:22.138 --> 09:23.771
What am I going to say to Jeff?

09:24.011 --> 09:25.396
He never called me back.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.517
Maybe he didn't get the message.

09:28.767 --> 09:31.696
Maybe he couldn't hear you
over the tornado.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.581
Well, I don't even know if
I want him to have heard me.

09:34.650 --> 09:36.628
- It's complicated.
- Mm.

09:36.635 --> 09:39.157
My boyfriend Jerry
got hit in the head by a mailbox

09:39.158 --> 09:40.351
during the tornado.

09:40.585 --> 09:42.202
He's been in a coma ever since.

09:42.485 --> 09:44.385
I visit him every day to read to him.

09:44.994 --> 09:46.527
I'm on the fifth Harry
Potter book, and...

09:46.595 --> 09:47.621
Ooh! You know what we could do?

09:47.622 --> 09:49.665
Maybe we could do a test
in front of one of those big fans

09:49.666 --> 09:51.071
to see if he could hear you.

09:51.236 --> 09:53.236
God, that's an amazing idea!

09:53.836 --> 09:55.357
He's off the breathing tube.

09:56.084 --> 09:57.061
That's good.

09:58.173 --> 10:00.881
Okay, I need three of you
to help me unload a truck.

10:00.882 --> 10:03.556
Don, Marcus, and... Myrtle.

10:04.415 --> 10:05.920
Meet me in back in five.

10:08.493 --> 10:09.522
Tough luck, dude.

10:09.523 --> 10:10.784
Ah, it's fine.

10:11.869 --> 10:13.172
Oh, hey, listen.

10:13.173 --> 10:15.098
I heard about your living situation

10:15.099 --> 10:18.318
and if you want, you can crash with me.

10:18.961 --> 10:21.025
Wow. Uh, that's...

10:21.660 --> 10:23.312
That's really nice, Marcus. Thank you.

10:23.313 --> 10:26.111
Yes! The horsemen! Living together!

10:26.399 --> 10:27.599
Partying hard.

10:27.674 --> 10:29.407
Luring ladies back to the pad.

10:29.523 --> 10:31.189
I'm sorry. "Luring?"

10:31.191 --> 10:33.425
Hilarious. You know what I mean.

10:33.842 --> 10:34.654
I don't, actually.

10:34.655 --> 10:36.839
You're a crazy man.
We're going to be on fire.

10:36.841 --> 10:38.377
Chicks are going to be
banging down the door,

10:38.378 --> 10:40.929
and we'll be like,
"Please, ladies, one at a time."

10:42.399 --> 10:43.277
One at a time,

10:43.278 --> 10:45.118
as in there's... there's two of us

10:45.120 --> 10:46.193
and one of them?

10:48.994 --> 10:50.794
No.

10:54.514 --> 10:56.424
Hey, uh, Garrett.

10:56.425 --> 10:59.166
Um, I'm supposed to give a speech later,

10:59.234 --> 11:03.136
and I'm a little nervous
about it, uh, given that...

11:03.219 --> 11:04.996
I'm sorry. I'm a little
embarrassed to say.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.007
- Your voice.
- What? No. Not...

11:07.076 --> 11:09.582
Given that I didn't prepare anything.

11:11.014 --> 11:12.431
What's wrong with my voice?

11:12.432 --> 11:14.070
Nothing. You have a nice voice.

11:14.071 --> 11:15.817
Garrett, I'm not a child.

11:15.824 --> 11:17.395
If there's something
wrong with my voice,

11:17.396 --> 11:18.713
you can just tell me.

11:19.175 --> 11:20.741
Okay. Um...

11:21.013 --> 11:23.417
Some people... not me,
but some people...

11:23.418 --> 11:25.425
might find your voice, octave-wise,

11:25.776 --> 11:28.065
to be the teeniest, tiniest, bit...

11:29.098 --> 11:29.656
High.

11:29.925 --> 11:31.525
What?

11:31.813 --> 11:33.080
- Yeah.
- Who?

11:33.769 --> 11:35.945
Uh, anyone with ears.

11:39.805 --> 11:40.887
That's everybody.

11:40.889 --> 11:42.547
Yeah, it's high.

11:54.726 --> 11:57.260
<i>Hi, I'm Glenn. This is my voice.</i>

11:57.667 --> 12:01.269
How come no one ever told me
that I sounded like that?

12:01.331 --> 12:02.701
We thought you knew.

12:02.823 --> 12:06.009
But that's not how I sound
on the inside!

12:06.035 --> 12:09.533
On the inside, I sound like,
"Hi, I'm Glenn."

12:09.939 --> 12:12.039
That's the same voice.

12:12.108 --> 12:14.642
Not what you hear. What I hear.

12:14.711 --> 12:17.238
Okay, I found a costume shop
with two Minion costumes.

12:17.239 --> 12:18.599
Do I have a weird voice?

12:18.626 --> 12:19.974
Yeah. It's preposterous.

12:19.976 --> 12:22.241
Anyway, I guess they were
rented for some birthday party,

12:22.242 --> 12:23.579
but the kid was murdered or kidnapped,

12:23.581 --> 12:25.313
or changed his mind or
something. I don't know.

12:25.314 --> 12:26.564
I wasn't listening. The point is,

12:26.565 --> 12:28.070
you two should go right
now and pick them up.

12:28.078 --> 12:30.265
- What? Why us two?
- Together?

12:30.326 --> 12:31.811
We have a lot to do. All right?

12:31.820 --> 12:33.027
Henry can't be around children.

12:33.096 --> 12:34.353
Marcus is on his third DUI.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.726
Elias is afraid of Minions.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.894
Nobody knows where Brett is!

12:40.436 --> 12:42.437
Uh, wow. This is the worst.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.239
Sorry, no, I... no.

12:45.308 --> 12:48.142
I just meant that... that this...

12:48.978 --> 12:50.481
This is the worst.

12:57.654 --> 12:59.572
You want to listen to a podcast?

13:00.123 --> 13:00.844
Sure.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.793
My phone got stolen from my trailer.

13:05.862 --> 13:07.929
I thought you were going to say "no."

13:09.299 --> 13:10.498
I love you!

13:10.567 --> 13:12.066
I love you! Can you hear me?

13:12.135 --> 13:13.467
I love you!

13:13.536 --> 13:14.503
I love you!

13:16.172 --> 13:17.638
I'm just doing a test.

13:17.707 --> 13:20.041
I don't even really know
how I feel about it for sure.

13:20.109 --> 13:21.452
I mean, it's complicated.

13:21.482 --> 13:22.881
I'm Mateo!

13:23.216 --> 13:24.315
Okay, man.

13:24.447 --> 13:26.364
Okay, man. See you around!

13:29.385 --> 13:30.565
So hot.

13:39.696 --> 13:41.529
Listen, uh...

13:41.598 --> 13:43.497
I'm sorry I didn't know
who you were before.

13:43.566 --> 13:45.533
I'm not super up on pop culture.

13:45.602 --> 13:47.368
Don't worry about it.

13:47.437 --> 13:49.337
Look at us.

13:49.405 --> 13:51.339
An hour ago, I had no idea who you were,

13:51.407 --> 13:52.840
and now we're flirting.

13:54.072 --> 13:55.743
Well, you should probably get back

13:55.812 --> 13:57.578
to straightening around the registers.

13:58.815 --> 13:59.796
What's funny?

14:02.188 --> 14:03.384
You're being serious?

14:03.453 --> 14:06.584
I'm sorry. Am I supposed
to say "Action" or something?

14:14.263 --> 14:17.365
Look, I get that you're still
with Adam, and I...

14:17.433 --> 14:19.639
Can we please not talk about Adam?

14:20.336 --> 14:25.740
Hey! Are we just,
like, not friends anymore?

14:26.293 --> 14:28.676
Yes. Of course we're friends.
Nobody said we're not friends.

14:28.745 --> 14:31.812
Friends don't sit in a car for
43 minutes in complete silence.

14:31.896 --> 14:34.076
Friends have conversations. They talk.

14:34.077 --> 14:36.083
Okay, Jonah, let's talk.

14:36.152 --> 14:38.886
We kissed, and now everything's
awkward and loaded,

14:38.955 --> 14:40.321
and I don't how to be around you.

14:40.390 --> 14:42.640
Is that the conversation
you want to have?

14:43.238 --> 14:44.226
Didn't think so.

14:46.429 --> 14:48.137
It is my pleasure

14:48.138 --> 14:50.649
to welcome you to Cloud 9!

14:51.806 --> 14:52.933
What do you think?

14:53.002 --> 14:57.138
Uh, try saying "We have your
son. $1 million or he dies."

14:58.775 --> 15:00.087
We have your son.

15:00.194 --> 15:02.361
$1 million or he dies!

15:02.712 --> 15:03.627
That's tight.

15:04.746 --> 15:06.312
How's it going with the ribbon?

15:06.389 --> 15:07.839
Well, I'm six minutes into this video

15:07.840 --> 15:08.870
on how to tie a fancy bow,

15:08.871 --> 15:10.813
and this guy's still
talking about his cat!

15:10.814 --> 15:12.524
It's like, "We get it. You're gay."

15:12.548 --> 15:15.169
And these are the biggest
scissors I could find.

15:15.170 --> 15:17.079
We can't cut a giant ribbon with these!

15:17.080 --> 15:18.590
Okay, we'll be ready in about an hour.

15:18.591 --> 15:19.589
An hour?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.260
The opening is now.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.497
Ooh, then you're going to
need to stall big-time.

15:23.566 --> 15:24.832
Hey, guys.

15:25.582 --> 15:27.635
Everybody excited for the big day?

15:27.704 --> 15:29.064
How's it looking inside?

15:30.239 --> 15:31.372
Different.

15:31.441 --> 15:32.390
No, no, no.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.522
I want to show you something over here.

15:34.868 --> 15:35.834
- Over here?
- Yeah.

15:35.910 --> 15:36.615
Okay.

15:37.815 --> 15:39.293
- Right here?
- Yeah.

15:40.283 --> 15:42.706
Beautiful rug. Good for him.

15:47.725 --> 15:50.880
It's my great pleasure
to welcome you to Cloud 9.

15:57.769 --> 15:59.635
Thank you, Glenn. That was beautiful.

15:59.637 --> 16:02.110
Thank you very much.
Um, okay, hey, listen.

16:02.368 --> 16:04.140
Let's cut that ribbon and check it out!

16:09.014 --> 16:13.416
But first, the comedic
stylings of Mr. Howie Mandel!

16:15.153 --> 16:18.021
Uh...

16:18.023 --> 16:21.491
This, uh, event was set up
by my, uh, appearance agent,

16:21.493 --> 16:23.726
not my, uh, performance agent.

16:23.728 --> 16:27.230
Performing is a whole...
different negotiation,

16:27.232 --> 16:28.398
so, uh...

16:29.040 --> 16:30.472
Thank you, everybody.

16:36.007 --> 16:38.875
Then I guess... I guess
I'll keep talking.

16:40.311 --> 16:43.713
6:31. 6:30. 6:29.

16:43.715 --> 16:44.859
How is this helping?

16:44.860 --> 16:47.621
How is you asking "how
it's helping" helping?

16:48.386 --> 16:50.411
6:22. 6:21.

16:54.092 --> 16:55.892
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Ow. Ooh!

16:55.894 --> 16:57.693
- You're gonna break the Minion.
- Don't break the Minion.

16:57.695 --> 17:01.197
When you get to hour two, minute twelve,

17:01.199 --> 17:03.633
of "Pirates of the Caribbean,"

17:03.635 --> 17:06.757
you can see one of the
pirates is wearing a watch.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.640
That's a... that's a goof.

17:14.712 --> 17:16.445
I can't hear you!

17:16.448 --> 17:18.580
- Here you go. You stand still!
- Ow!

17:22.686 --> 17:24.820
- This is the wrong arm.
- Just go.

17:24.823 --> 17:28.925
Can... can you tell
other people's jokes?

17:28.927 --> 17:29.561
No.

17:31.296 --> 17:32.466
Can I?

17:33.998 --> 17:35.352
I... I guess.

17:38.103 --> 17:39.535
I don't know any.

17:43.408 --> 17:44.807
Ah! I'm gonna fall.

17:44.809 --> 17:46.709
Oh, oh, okay.

17:57.288 --> 17:59.889
<i>Get thirsty, amigos.</i>

18:01.259 --> 18:02.859
Welcome back, shoppers.

18:02.861 --> 18:04.427
I'm sure you're all very excited

18:04.429 --> 18:05.862
that we've reopened.

18:05.864 --> 18:07.864
Or more likely, you don't care at all,

18:07.866 --> 18:09.966
'cause it's just a store.

18:11.469 --> 18:15.738
Badabadbadaba.

18:15.740 --> 18:17.892
"Badabadabadaba?" What... Really?

18:17.893 --> 18:20.843
I've never seen the movie.
I thought they spoke gibberish.

18:20.845 --> 18:23.179
They speak a blend of pidgin languages

18:23.181 --> 18:24.680
mixed with gibberish, but

18:24.682 --> 18:27.683
"badabadbadaba," that's almost racist.

18:29.654 --> 18:32.622
Banana. Banana.

18:32.624 --> 18:34.357
Beep-boop-bop-bop-boop.

18:34.359 --> 18:36.058
I'm getting divorced.

18:37.595 --> 18:39.295
Oh. Um...

18:39.297 --> 18:42.865
We woke up the morning
after the tornado, and realized

18:42.867 --> 18:45.668
just because we were happy
to see each other alive,

18:45.670 --> 18:48.538
didn't mean that we should stay married.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.640
- Wow.
- Yeah.

18:50.642 --> 18:54.043
Well, I'm... I'm here, you know,

18:54.045 --> 18:56.412
if you ever want to talk, or...

18:56.414 --> 18:58.623
Do you want to have sex?

19:02.954 --> 19:04.187
Uh...

19:04.189 --> 19:06.656
- I'm joking!
- Yeah, obviously,

19:06.658 --> 19:09.158
you're joking. I knew you were...
I'm not...

19:09.160 --> 19:12.061
- Are you blushing?
- Big-time, yeah.

19:14.165 --> 19:16.165
Jeff.

19:16.167 --> 19:18.234
Mateo. Hey.

19:18.634 --> 19:19.837
How you been?

19:19.938 --> 19:22.071
Good, thanks. Yeah, I'm in a good place.

19:22.073 --> 19:24.740
You know, I've been hitting
the gym pretty hard.

19:24.742 --> 19:26.111
Doing a lot of Zuh-MBA.

19:26.844 --> 19:29.011
Um, I just need to ask you something.

19:29.013 --> 19:31.080
Did you get a voice mail, by chance?

19:31.082 --> 19:34.383
Oh, sorry, one second.
Uh, ooh, I have to take this.

19:34.385 --> 19:35.281
It's Chad.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.753
- Your ex, Chad?
- Yes.

19:37.755 --> 19:41.057
We got back together. Hey, sweetie.

19:41.059 --> 19:44.927
Mm, just real quick.
It's pronounced Zumba, okay?

19:44.929 --> 19:47.396
And your toupee, it's garbage.

19:47.398 --> 19:49.065
You look like a fry cook.

20:04.682 --> 20:07.550
Okay, well, this is going to be fun.

20:07.552 --> 20:10.152
Now, do you want to room
with Timur or Jacob?

20:10.154 --> 20:13.122
Timur's a sweetheart,
but he does have night terrors.

20:13.124 --> 20:16.225
On the other hand,
Jacob is really quiet,

20:16.227 --> 20:18.127
but in a scary way.

20:18.129 --> 20:21.130
Sometimes you wake up and he's
just standing over you.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.870
All right. You can stay with me.

20:24.158 --> 20:26.435
Really? Are you... are you sure?

20:26.437 --> 20:28.571
No, I'm definitely not sure,

20:28.573 --> 20:29.805
but whatever.

20:30.860 --> 20:32.873
Oh, okay.

20:34.336 --> 20:36.145
Well, if anything changes,

20:36.147 --> 20:40.016
the men's bathroom key
also works on my front door.

20:41.586 --> 20:43.919
- Okay, roomie.
- House rules.

20:43.921 --> 20:45.755
Do not touch my video game stuff.

20:45.757 --> 20:47.823
No talking during "Game of Thrones."

20:47.825 --> 20:49.113
No cooking fish.

20:49.114 --> 20:50.975
And leave me out of your
coffee-making process.

20:50.976 --> 20:53.763
I'll have to, because
it's a French single press.

20:53.765 --> 20:55.331
I do not like fragrant soaps,

20:55.333 --> 20:57.333
on Wednesday, my black
friends come over,

20:57.335 --> 20:59.101
so do not be around.

20:59.103 --> 21:01.470
What else? Parking spots.

21:01.471 --> 21:03.004
You don't get one.
