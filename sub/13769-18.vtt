00:03.086 --> 00:05.380
Hal, I'm leaving a sandwich

00:03.086 --> 00:05.380
here for you.

00:03.086 --> 00:05.380
Thanks, honey.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.865
Wow.

00:30.906 --> 00:31.740
That was quick.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.742
You must have been

00:31.782 --> 00:33.742
really hungry.

Come on, boys, breakfast!

01:14.658 --> 01:16.035
Let's go!

01:16.076 --> 01:18.119
You're going to be late!

01:16.076 --> 01:18.119
Hal, look what you're doing.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.163
Oh, for God's sake!

01:20.205 --> 01:21.122
(groans)

01:21.164 --> 01:22.416
My last good tie.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.418
No. I just bought you

01:22.457 --> 01:24.418
a whole 12-pack.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.627
Well, I went

01:24.459 --> 01:25.627
through it!

01:25.669 --> 01:26.253
Mom!

01:27.671 --> 01:29.381
Oh, for the love of Pete!

01:29.423 --> 01:31.132
Reese blew his nose on my shirt!

01:31.174 --> 01:33.176
Because Dewey put his dirty

01:31.174 --> 01:33.176
underwear on my pillow!

01:33.218 --> 01:34.595
MALCOLM:

01:33.218 --> 01:34.595
And one of them used

01:34.636 --> 01:37.138
my graphing calculator to

01:34.636 --> 01:37.138
smash open a juice box!

01:37.180 --> 01:38.557
Everybody just shut up!

01:38.599 --> 01:40.141
Your mother is nine months

01:38.599 --> 01:40.141
pregnant.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.769
She's stressed out enough

01:40.183 --> 01:41.769
as it is!

01:41.810 --> 01:43.062
She doesn't need

01:41.810 --> 01:43.062
all this screaming!

01:43.102 --> 01:44.939
All right,

01:43.102 --> 01:44.939
you know what?

01:44.980 --> 01:47.608
I know how to solve this.

01:49.068 --> 01:50.527
We're only going to be gone

01:49.068 --> 01:50.527
for two days.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.153
We're going to have

01:50.569 --> 01:52.153
at least one weekend

01:52.195 --> 01:54.448
before this baby's born where

01:52.195 --> 01:54.448
we get some peace and quiet.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.033
Without us?

01:56.075 --> 01:56.617
You know the plan?

01:56.658 --> 01:57.576
As soon as you leave,

01:57.618 --> 01:58.619
I put Reese on a bus

01:58.660 --> 02:00.037
to his grandma in Canada.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.413
After school, I take

02:00.079 --> 02:01.413
Malcolm over to Stevie's.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.457
And Dewey stays with me.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.001
Looks like you're

02:03.498 --> 02:06.001
the lucky winner.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.544
Why are you splitting us up?

02:07.586 --> 02:08.879
Because this

02:07.586 --> 02:08.879
is the only way

02:08.921 --> 02:10.589
the judge would

02:08.921 --> 02:10.589
let us leave town.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.176
Have fun in school

02:13.216 --> 02:15.176
today, suckers.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.177
I'll send you

02:16.219 --> 02:17.596
a postcard from Whitehorse.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.889
Reese, figure it out.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.892
It takes 26 hours to get there

02:18.931 --> 02:21.892
and 26 hours back.

02:21.934 --> 02:25.353
Your backpack is full of food,

02:21.934 --> 02:25.353
and no one ever called Grandma.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.188
Wait a minute.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.233
I'm spending the entire weekend

02:27.230 --> 02:30.233
on this bus?

02:33.236 --> 02:34.905
(sighs)

02:34.947 --> 02:36.615
I'm so glad we're finally here.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.200
I can't believe you made me

02:36.657 --> 02:39.200
walk that extra 150 yards.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.828
Trust me, valet parking--

02:40.869 --> 02:43.831
even complimentary

02:40.869 --> 02:43.831
valet parking-- is a scam.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.874
Welcome to Lovebirds,

02:43.872 --> 02:45.874
a couples resort.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.208
Wow.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.044
Hi. We have a reservation.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.005
Could we get to

02:49.086 --> 02:51.005
our room quickly?

02:51.046 --> 02:52.881
I really have to

02:51.046 --> 02:52.881
use the bathroom.

02:52.923 --> 02:53.841
Again.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.925
I'm sorry, but the room

02:54.967 --> 02:56.051
we were holding for you

02:56.093 --> 02:57.218
is no longer available.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.679
You gave away our room?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.263
I'm sorry, sir.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.263
You were four hours late,

03:00.305 --> 03:01.306
and you didn't call.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.516
But it's my wife.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.225
We have to stop every ten miles

03:04.267 --> 03:06.227
because she has

03:04.267 --> 03:06.227
to pee all the time.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.855
I do not have to

03:06.269 --> 03:07.855
pee all the time.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.649
Don't worry. I think

03:07.896 --> 03:10.649
we can find you something.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.693
I don't know

03:10.691 --> 03:12.693
if you've read our brochures,

03:12.734 --> 03:16.655
but this is sort of

03:12.734 --> 03:16.655
a romantic hideaway for couples.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.281
We know what it is.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.117
Let me see what I can do.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.910
I have to get

03:20.159 --> 03:21.910
off my feet.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.620
Angela...

03:23.662 --> 03:26.081
Yes, Warren? Yes?

03:28.125 --> 03:29.250
(sighs)

03:29.292 --> 03:30.251
I am so sorry.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.046
I just had

03:30.293 --> 03:32.046
to sit down.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.338
Don't...

03:32.087 --> 03:33.338
don't mind me.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.549
You mind if we turn off

03:33.380 --> 03:35.549
that fireplace?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.425
I'm sweating

03:35.590 --> 03:37.425
like a pig.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.719
(sighs)

03:38.760 --> 03:40.637
Well, little man,

03:38.760 --> 03:40.637
you and I have quite

03:40.679 --> 03:42.430
the fun-filled

03:40.679 --> 03:42.430
weekend ahead of us.

03:42.472 --> 03:46.060
Tomorrow morning, there's jazz

03:42.472 --> 03:46.060
at the Farmer's Market.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.853
Then Lifetime is having

03:46.101 --> 03:47.853
an intimate portrait

03:47.895 --> 03:49.270
of Sandy Bullock.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.272
And tomorrow night,

03:49.312 --> 03:51.272
there's Improv in the Park

03:51.314 --> 03:52.273
with a political bent.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.358
Sound fun?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.152
I think I just

03:53.400 --> 03:55.152
want to play.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.528
Play? Well, sure,

03:56.570 --> 03:58.279
we could squeeze in

03:56.570 --> 03:58.279
some play, I guess.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.323
Why don't you go ahead

03:58.321 --> 04:00.323
and get that started?

04:00.365 --> 04:02.283
No, I mean play together.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.283
What do you mean?

04:02.325 --> 04:03.202
We can play fort.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.285
Ooh, I don't have Fort.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.121
I have Clue,

04:06.163 --> 04:07.748
but it's a collector's edition,

04:06.163 --> 04:07.748
unopened.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.750
If you want,

04:07.789 --> 04:09.750
I can show you a picture of it.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.169
No. You don't have to

04:09.791 --> 04:12.169
have  fort. You just do it.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.171
Didn't you ever play fort

04:12.211 --> 04:14.171
with your friends

04:14.213 --> 04:15.296
when you were a kid?

04:15.338 --> 04:16.798
Of course I played.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.300
I had friends,

04:16.840 --> 04:19.300
plenty of friends.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.302
And you're short.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.305
Come on. I'll show you.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.306
Hello, ma'am.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.684
This is Mel Jenkins

04:25.348 --> 04:27.684
with Transway Bus Lines.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.352
I don't know how

04:27.726 --> 04:29.352
to tell you this.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.397
I was keeping an eye on your son

04:29.394 --> 04:32.397
for you, like you asked,

04:32.439 --> 04:34.399
but when we got out

04:32.439 --> 04:34.399
on the interstate,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.317
he went into the bathroom,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.317
and...

04:36.359 --> 04:39.362
Well, he must have jumped out

04:36.359 --> 04:39.362
the window while we were moving.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.240
I'd gone 60 miles

04:39.404 --> 04:41.240
before I noticed.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.616
REESE:

04:41.281 --> 04:42.616
What?!

04:42.657 --> 04:44.826
How could you do this

04:42.657 --> 04:44.826
to my favorite son?

04:44.868 --> 04:47.370
The only one I ever loved

04:47.412 --> 04:48.747
is now lying

04:48.789 --> 04:50.331
in a ditch somewhere.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.334
Well, I'd better

04:50.373 --> 04:53.334
call the coffin store.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.796
Good-bye.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.393
I knew it!

05:10.435 --> 05:12.562
I knew if I came back

05:10.435 --> 05:12.562
I'd catch you here.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.355
You can't be trusted

05:12.604 --> 05:14.355
for five seconds,

05:14.397 --> 05:15.857
let alone a whole weekend.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.068
Okay, look, just don't tell...

05:18.110 --> 05:20.154
Wait a minute.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.362
What are  you  doing here?

05:21.404 --> 05:23.364
Me? I'm here to...

05:23.406 --> 05:26.618
guard the house from

05:23.406 --> 05:26.618
your bad things you're doing.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.036
What's in the bag?

05:28.078 --> 05:29.412
Candles...

05:29.454 --> 05:31.372
chocolate-covered

05:29.454 --> 05:31.372
strawberries...

05:33.208 --> 05:35.169
Sleepless in Seattle.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.586
My God, you're gay.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.879
No, I'm not.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.422
Look, I don't know

05:37.921 --> 05:39.422
how I did it,

05:39.464 --> 05:42.383
but I talked Kathy McCulskey

05:39.464 --> 05:42.383
into coming over tonight.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.385
Kathy McCulskey?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.386
I'm impressed.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.805
She doesn't leave her house

05:46.847 --> 05:48.389
for anything less

05:46.847 --> 05:48.389
than second base.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.809
Which is exactly why we need

05:48.431 --> 05:50.809
the house to ourselves.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.061
I'm sorry, Malcolm. I'm already

05:50.851 --> 05:53.061
committed to this party.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.896
Reese, you've seen

05:53.103 --> 05:54.896
enough teenage movies

05:54.938 --> 05:56.982
to know how badly this

05:54.938 --> 05:56.982
is going to turn out.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.067
I haven't just seen them,

05:57.024 --> 05:59.067
I've studied them.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.401
And I found the fatal flaw.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.653
In every one of those movies,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.404
the party was

06:01.695 --> 06:03.404
on a Saturday night.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.448
Mine? Friday.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.201
This gives me an extra day

06:07.242 --> 06:09.410
to refill the pool,

06:07.242 --> 06:09.410
replace the crystal thing,

06:09.452 --> 06:10.787
turn back the odometer,

06:10.829 --> 06:12.413
and get the dead bodies back

06:10.829 --> 06:12.413
in the ground.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.415
Please don't do this to me.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.583
Tell you what, Malcolm.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.418
I'll try and keep

06:15.625 --> 06:17.418
the front room closet

06:17.460 --> 06:18.628
off limits as long as I can.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.301
I thought we reserved

06:22.049 --> 06:24.301
a deluxe suite.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.426
No, ma'am.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.428
This is the

06:25.468 --> 06:27.428
Petite Sleeper.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.388
Thank you.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.388
Thank you very much.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.433
Why do they bother

06:30.640 --> 06:32.433
giving you a confirmation number

06:32.475 --> 06:34.853
if they're just going

06:32.475 --> 06:34.853
to give your room away anyway?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.063
Don't be mad at them.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.314
It's not their fault.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.606
Oh, yeah, so it's my fault.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.317
I didn't say that.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.735
Well, at least

06:40.359 --> 06:41.735
we have a great view

06:41.776 --> 06:43.111
of the parking lot from here.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.239
At home, I have to crane my neck

06:43.153 --> 06:45.239
to see our car.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.447
Look, you know what?

06:46.489 --> 06:48.033
The room is what it is.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.451
So we just have to try to

06:48.075 --> 06:50.451
make the best of it.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.329
We're here. We have a

06:50.493 --> 06:52.329
little time to ourselves.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.706
Let's find a way

06:52.371 --> 06:54.706
to enjoy it, hmm?

06:55.665 --> 06:57.167
I have to pee.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.087
Of course you do.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.462
Oh, perfect.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.048
They promised us

07:01.504 --> 07:03.048
a heart-shaped tub.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.299
We got a tub-shaped tub.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.468
For the love of God,

07:04.341 --> 07:07.468
will you take a break?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.388
I know you're pregnant.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.472
I know you're uncomfortable.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.474
I know you're swollen

07:11.514 --> 07:13.474
and puffy and distended

07:13.516 --> 07:16.853
and inflated, but you've just

07:13.516 --> 07:16.853
got to stop complaining.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.272
Well, I'm sorry

07:16.895 --> 07:18.272
I'm such a burden.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.773
In another three weeks,

07:19.814 --> 07:21.858
you won't ever have to

07:19.814 --> 07:21.858
suffer through this again.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.069
Well, we don't know that.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.071
What did you say?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.073
I said,

07:28.115 --> 07:29.324
I'd move the car.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.491
No, you said,

07:30.533 --> 07:32.369
we don't know

07:30.533 --> 07:32.369
that, but, Hal...

07:32.411 --> 07:33.745
Hal, we do know that,

07:33.787 --> 07:36.081
because you had

07:33.787 --> 07:36.081
a vasectomy.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.791
Yes, I did.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.585
Oh, my God,

07:37.832 --> 07:40.585
you didn't do it!

07:40.627 --> 07:42.670
You lied to me.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.671
Just a little.

07:43.713 --> 07:44.965
Hal, you sat

07:43.713 --> 07:44.965
with an ice pack

07:45.006 --> 07:46.216
on your crotch

07:45.006 --> 07:46.216
for three days.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.218
Well, that should count

07:46.258 --> 07:48.218
for something.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.510
Hal, we talked about this.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.553
We agreed on this.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.721
No,  you  agreed on it!

07:51.763 --> 07:53.307
I never wanted a vasectomy.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.100
There are plenty of

07:53.348 --> 07:55.100
other methods out there.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.435
Oh, yeah, they work.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.228
We've got our

07:56.476 --> 07:58.228
rhythm method child,

07:58.270 --> 08:00.563
our diaphragm child,

07:58.270 --> 08:00.563
our condom child.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.524
Oh, yes, and our two

08:00.605 --> 08:03.524
abstinence children.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.444
Lois, you just

08:03.566 --> 08:05.444
don't understand

08:05.485 --> 08:08.529
how extraordinarily precious

08:05.485 --> 08:08.529
those parts are to me.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.782
Precious?!

08:08.571 --> 08:10.782
Hal, give me a break.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.533
You're not that guy.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.535
You've never been that guy.

08:14.577 --> 08:18.915
When it comes to this,

08:14.577 --> 08:18.915
every guy is that guy.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.335
C-4.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.419
Hit.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.007
E-4.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.059
Hit.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.772
Hey, you guys want to come

08:42.814 --> 08:44.358
to a party at my house?

08:44.399 --> 08:45.275
It's going to be amazing.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.444
My parents are gone

08:45.317 --> 08:47.444
for the whole weekend.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.569
The whole weekend?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.570
You heard me.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.781
48 hours, totally unsupervised.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.492
Anything goes.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.575
Total freedom, man.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.453
Interesting.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.831
This'll do.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.592
What's this junk?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.220
What is going on?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.637
Okay, here's

09:13.261 --> 09:14.637
what's going to happen.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.597
We have some private business

09:14.679 --> 09:16.597
to conduct.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.266
This is now our garage

09:18.308 --> 09:19.809
for the next 48 hours.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.602
You don't come near it.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.602
You don't ask about it.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.813
We get out

09:21.644 --> 09:23.813
before your parents come back.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.273
They never have to find out

09:25.315 --> 09:27.025
that you're the one

09:25.315 --> 09:27.025
who invited us.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.109
What the hell

09:27.067 --> 09:28.109
are you guys doing?

09:28.151 --> 09:29.069
You know, he just

09:29.110 --> 09:30.070
explained it really well,

09:30.111 --> 09:31.654
but all I could hear was

09:30.111 --> 09:31.654
my own heartbeat.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.614
Reese, that stuff is...

09:33.656 --> 09:35.075
See, that's you guys talking,

09:35.116 --> 09:36.617
and that doesn't work for me.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.660
Now, can I trust

09:36.659 --> 09:37.660
that you guys

09:37.702 --> 09:38.870
won't talk, or am I going

09:38.912 --> 09:40.247
to have to remove something

09:40.288 --> 09:41.664
to make it physically

09:40.288 --> 09:41.664
impossible?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.926
("Beautiful Dreamer" playing)

10:17.700 --> 10:20.661
And that is not

10:17.700 --> 10:20.661
the worst part

10:20.703 --> 10:22.330
of the operation.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.958
Once they split open

10:22.372 --> 10:24.958
your coin purse,

10:24.999 --> 10:26.585
they pull out the vas deferens,

10:26.626 --> 10:29.129
put it on the table

10:26.626 --> 10:29.129
and... chop!

10:29.170 --> 10:30.171
And they don't

10:29.170 --> 10:30.171
always get it

10:30.213 --> 10:31.339
on the first chop, either.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.924
Chop, chop, chop!

10:32.966 --> 10:33.925
Can I get you guys

10:32.966 --> 10:33.925
another drink?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.135
Set us up, will you?

10:35.176 --> 10:36.761
(heavy metal blaring)

10:36.803 --> 10:38.096
It's been three hours

10:38.138 --> 10:40.098
since these guys

10:38.138 --> 10:40.098
took over our house.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.849
So far, there's been

10:40.140 --> 10:41.849
a few fires,

10:41.891 --> 10:43.351
I've had a bottle thrown at me

10:43.393 --> 10:44.603
and I've even been threatened

10:43.393 --> 10:44.603
with death.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.354
On the other hand,

10:46.396 --> 10:49.274
they haven't stopped raving

10:46.396 --> 10:49.274
about Reese's bean dip.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.318
So the evening could go

10:49.316 --> 10:51.318
either way.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.902
Did Fast Eddie

10:51.359 --> 10:52.902
like his salmon?

10:52.944 --> 10:54.154
In about an hour I'm gonna need

10:54.195 --> 10:55.947
you guys to dump a

10:54.195 --> 10:55.947
50-gallon drum of...

10:55.989 --> 10:58.741
stuff. Do it quick,

10:58.783 --> 11:01.077
don't draw attention

10:58.783 --> 11:01.077
to yourselves,

11:01.119 --> 11:02.579
and don't breathe in

11:01.119 --> 11:02.579
when you're doing it.

11:02.621 --> 11:03.704
Look, it's one thing

11:02.621 --> 11:03.704
to ask us

11:03.746 --> 11:04.914
to stay out

11:03.746 --> 11:04.914
of your business,

11:04.956 --> 11:06.374
but when you try

11:04.956 --> 11:06.374
to involve us...

11:06.416 --> 11:07.626
Okay.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.419
Hey, Donnie, the soufflés

11:07.667 --> 11:09.419
are almost up.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.004
Hmm.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.004
(doorbell rings)

11:11.045 --> 11:12.589
Who the hell is that?

11:12.631 --> 11:15.467
I don't know.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.467
It's... Oh, no.

11:20.639 --> 11:21.889
Who ordered the girl?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.141
Not me.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.141
I didn't do it.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.017
Kathy, hi.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.186
Hey.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.729
You didn't tell me

11:26.227 --> 11:28.729
there were going

11:26.227 --> 11:28.729
to be other guys here.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.607
Yeah, well...

11:28.771 --> 11:30.607
Just 'cause you

11:28.771 --> 11:30.607
read something

11:30.649 --> 11:32.442
on a bathroom wall

11:30.649 --> 11:32.442
doesn't mean it's true.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.777
No. Look, these

11:32.484 --> 11:34.777
are cousins of mine.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.613
You know,

11:34.819 --> 11:36.613
friend cousins.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.157
They dropped in

11:36.655 --> 11:39.157
unexpectedly.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.741
So, you know, right now

11:39.199 --> 11:40.741
isn't a good time.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.742
Obviously not.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.744
We could still do the dinner

11:41.784 --> 11:43.744
and talking part.

11:43.786 --> 11:44.745
God.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.665
Yeah, man, show some class.

11:46.705 --> 11:47.748
Thank you.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.251
Kathy, listen,

11:47.790 --> 11:50.251
you have to trust me

11:47.790 --> 11:50.251
on this one.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.753
Hey, bring your girlfriend

11:50.293 --> 11:52.753
in here.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.839
Yeah.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.839
(laughter)

11:57.967 --> 12:01.596
♪ ♪

12:23.868 --> 12:27.788
...98, 99, 100.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.748
Ready or not, here I come.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.752
(snickering)

12:41.135 --> 12:42.262
There you are.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.056
(sobbing)

12:45.098 --> 12:46.807
What's wrong?

12:46.849 --> 12:49.686
No one ever

12:46.849 --> 12:49.686
found me before.

12:49.728 --> 12:53.189
It's because you're such

12:49.728 --> 12:53.189
a good hider.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.692
Yeah, that's probably it.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.737
Just put it anywhere.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.407
We had a hard time

13:00.572 --> 13:02.407
finding this old girl.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.451
You can imagine we don't get

13:02.449 --> 13:04.451
much call for it,

13:04.492 --> 13:05.744
this being a couples resort

13:04.492 --> 13:05.744
and all.

13:05.784 --> 13:06.494
Uh-huh.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.537
Not sure I even know

13:07.579 --> 13:08.829
how to operate

13:07.579 --> 13:08.829
the dang thing.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.831
I'm sure you'll

13:08.871 --> 13:10.831
figure it out.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.293
My gosh, I've been here

13:10.873 --> 13:13.293
for over 30 years

13:13.334 --> 13:15.503
and I ain't never done

13:13.334 --> 13:15.503
this before.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.422
We see all kind

13:15.545 --> 13:17.422
of couples here,

13:17.464 --> 13:18.465
but I've never seen...

13:18.506 --> 13:19.840
Thank you.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.840
I'll finish this.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.134
Fine by me.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.010
I've got to go up

13:21.175 --> 13:23.010
to Room 318

13:23.052 --> 13:24.887
and fill the bathtub

13:23.052 --> 13:24.887
with rose petals.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.144
(laughter and cheering)

13:31.185 --> 13:34.105
Arm. Five points for Chuck.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.568
Oh! Crotch again.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.028
15 points. Nice shot, Randy.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.657
Chuck, Randy, we got

13:41.070 --> 13:43.657
to put in the catalyst.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.866
Okay, we can finish

13:43.698 --> 13:45.866
this game later.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.076
Don't sit down, Chuck.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.495
You're still in this.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.331
I think it's a party again.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.873
Are you kidding me?

13:52.915 --> 13:55.126
This is

13:52.915 --> 13:55.126
a hostage situation.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.126
No.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.170
Reese, haven't you ever

13:55.168 --> 13:57.170
heard of Stockholm Syndrome?

13:57.211 --> 13:59.046
You're starting to identify

13:57.211 --> 13:59.046
with your captors.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.047
What captors?

14:00.089 --> 14:01.257
These guys saved

14:00.089 --> 14:01.257
my life, man.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.883
Because they decided

14:01.299 --> 14:02.883
not to kill you.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.051
Same thing.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.304
They made us accessories

14:04.093 --> 14:06.304
to some kind of felony.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.888
They're setting up

14:06.346 --> 14:07.888
a decontamination shower

14:07.930 --> 14:09.390
in front of the garage.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.892
And poor Kathy must have

14:09.432 --> 14:11.892
been completely traumatized.

14:11.934 --> 14:12.893
Where'd she go anyway?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.395
I'm never going

14:12.935 --> 14:14.395
to forgive myself

14:14.437 --> 14:15.605
for dragging her into this.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.773
We have to do something.

14:16.815 --> 14:17.898
You've got to

14:16.815 --> 14:17.898
relax, Malcolm.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.609
Some of these guys

14:17.940 --> 14:19.609
are really nice.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.528
Have you had Big Wanda

14:19.651 --> 14:21.528
tell you your fortune?

14:21.569 --> 14:23.154
Look, we can't handle this

14:21.569 --> 14:23.154
ourselves.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.364
We don't know how to deal

14:24.405 --> 14:26.199
with a whole bunch

14:24.405 --> 14:26.199
of low-life criminals.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.908
We need help.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.286
You guys did the right thing

14:27.950 --> 14:30.286
by calling me.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.372
Sorry to drag you out here

14:30.328 --> 14:32.372
all the way from the ranch.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.290
This shouldn't take long.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.916
They all in there?

14:35.958 --> 14:36.959
Yeah, well,

14:35.958 --> 14:36.959
one of them's

14:37.001 --> 14:38.336
in the bedroom

14:37.001 --> 14:38.336
with Kathy.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.086
Who's Kathy?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.714
My date.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.089
Dude.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.132
What are you

14:42.131 --> 14:43.132
going to do?

14:43.174 --> 14:44.759
How are you going

14:43.174 --> 14:44.759
to get them out?

14:44.801 --> 14:45.926
Whoa, whoa,

14:44.801 --> 14:45.926
slow down.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.137
You got to think

14:45.968 --> 14:48.137
these things through.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.807
We're going to handle this

14:48.179 --> 14:50.807
real delicately.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.933
When you're dealing

14:50.849 --> 14:52.933
with a complex

14:52.975 --> 14:55.603
psychological situation,

14:52.975 --> 14:55.603
you have to remember

14:55.645 --> 14:57.188
there's a lot

14:55.645 --> 14:57.188
of subtle machinations

14:57.230 --> 14:59.023
that come into play.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.571
Donnie?

15:04.612 --> 15:06.197
Francis? What are

15:04.612 --> 15:06.197
you  doing here?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.866
I heard you were

15:06.239 --> 15:07.866
in Alaska.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.783
No, I'm working

15:08.825 --> 15:09.950
at a ranch now. How you doing?

15:09.992 --> 15:11.160
You still hanging

15:09.992 --> 15:11.160
out at Kelsey's?

15:11.202 --> 15:12.953
No. They went

15:11.202 --> 15:12.953
karaoke.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.955
Oh, this town.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.458
So listen, this

15:14.997 --> 15:17.458
is my parents' house.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.959
These are my brothers.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.378
I know you didn't

15:19.001 --> 15:20.378
know that,

15:20.420 --> 15:21.671
but when you and your buddies

15:20.420 --> 15:21.671
took over the place,

15:21.713 --> 15:23.172
you kind of freaked them out

15:21.713 --> 15:23.172
a little bit.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.799
Oh.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.259
So, maybe you want

15:24.841 --> 15:26.259
to take this someplace else.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.968
Yeah, you know what?

15:28.010 --> 15:32.432
That just sounds

15:28.010 --> 15:32.432
like it's going

15:28.010 --> 15:32.432
to be hard, so... no.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.350
Hey, look, dude

15:32.473 --> 15:34.350
I know you don't want me

15:34.392 --> 15:35.976
to get the cops over here,

15:34.392 --> 15:35.976
do you?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.144
And I'm sure you

15:36.018 --> 15:37.144
wouldn't want me

15:37.186 --> 15:38.979
to tell them who pulled

15:37.186 --> 15:38.979
over the water tower.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.399
That was you, Francis.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.567
Really?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.778
Well, then maybe

15:42.609 --> 15:44.778
I should tell them

15:44.819 --> 15:46.404
about the highway overpass.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.030
That was also you.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.991
Car wash? The sinkhole?

15:51.033 --> 15:51.910
All you.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.911
Huh.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.789
Um, okay, well,

15:52.952 --> 15:55.789
you guys sit tight

15:55.830 --> 15:57.998
and we'll be in the house.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.125
If that's okay.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.964
Well, I think we gave 'em

16:01.669 --> 16:04.964
enough to think about.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.309
Hal.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.854
I thought I saw a spider.

16:19.896 --> 16:23.274
You want to just cut our losses

16:19.896 --> 16:23.274
and check out in the morning?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.651
I guess.

16:24.692 --> 16:28.279
Should we still do

16:24.692 --> 16:28.279
the Afterglow Breakfast?

16:29.781 --> 16:34.243
Well... we gotta eat.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.459
Are you sure

16:39.248 --> 16:41.459
I'm not too old

16:39.248 --> 16:41.459
for Winky Dinks?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.336
The box says

16:41.501 --> 16:43.336
"For ages eight

16:41.501 --> 16:43.336
and up."

16:43.377 --> 16:44.712
Well, I'm right

16:43.377 --> 16:44.712
smack-dab

16:44.754 --> 16:46.130
in the middle

16:44.754 --> 16:46.130
of that window.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.008
(chuckling)

16:55.014 --> 16:56.641
What the hell is this?

16:56.683 --> 16:57.725
Shh.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.353
We just got them

16:57.767 --> 17:00.353
to go to sleep.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.062
You boys aren't even

17:00.394 --> 17:02.062
supposed to be here

17:02.104 --> 17:03.105
and you're

17:02.104 --> 17:03.105
throwing

17:03.147 --> 17:04.273
a coed slumber party?

17:04.315 --> 17:06.233
Who's the fat chick?

17:06.275 --> 17:09.236
Okay, that's it. I want

17:06.275 --> 17:09.236
everybody out of here! Pronto!

17:09.278 --> 17:13.073
Hey! No one tells

17:09.278 --> 17:13.073
us  what to do.

17:09.278 --> 17:13.073
That's right.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.074
Craig, you might want...

17:14.116 --> 17:15.743
None of your excuses!

17:15.785 --> 17:17.286
You and your little friends

17:17.328 --> 17:18.830
are in a boatload of trouble.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.081
(screaming)

17:21.123 --> 17:22.792
(wild laughter)

17:23.960 --> 17:25.670
(screaming)

17:25.712 --> 17:27.087
(crying)

17:27.129 --> 17:28.589
Let's just go back

17:27.129 --> 17:28.589
to Craig's apartment

17:28.631 --> 17:29.799
and wait it out till Sunday.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.551
We can't just leave him here!

17:31.592 --> 17:34.094
Dewey, there's a principle

17:31.592 --> 17:34.094
I learned in military school.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.805
The needs of the many

17:34.136 --> 17:35.805
outweigh the needs

17:35.847 --> 17:37.097
of the guy who

17:35.847 --> 17:37.097
can't run fast.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.141
No! We face-painted

17:37.139 --> 17:39.141
each other.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.101
I'm not leaving him here.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.311
Dewey, there's nothing

17:41.143 --> 17:42.311
we can do.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.147
Not the crevice tool!

17:45.189 --> 17:46.440
(sobbing)

17:48.317 --> 17:50.611
I know what to do.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.113
Seven minutes till checkout.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.157
Do you have the soap,

17:53.155 --> 17:55.157
the sewing kit

17:55.199 --> 17:56.283
and the stationery?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.118
Got 'em.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.118
I also got the shampoos

17:58.160 --> 17:59.119
and the shoe cloth.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.121
I couldn't find the shower caps.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.749
I got 'em.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.749
Good.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.795
Are you coming?

18:07.837 --> 18:09.756
No. This is ridiculous.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.049
We came all this way

18:11.090 --> 18:13.133
to have one relaxing,

18:11.090 --> 18:13.133
romantic weekend

18:13.175 --> 18:15.803
and, and we're more tense

18:13.175 --> 18:15.803
than when we left the house.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.180
Well, there's nothing

18:15.845 --> 18:18.180
we can do about it now.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.223
Yes, there is.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.600
We've got seven minutes left.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.351
We paid for it.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.351
We're going to use it.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.937
How?

18:23.978 --> 18:27.147
By doing one nice thing

18:23.978 --> 18:27.147
for each other before we go.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.233
And we'd better make it good,

18:29.275 --> 18:31.027
because we're not going

18:31.069 --> 18:33.071
to have another chance at it

18:31.069 --> 18:33.071
for 18 years.

18:33.112 --> 18:38.451
Well... I suppose I

18:33.112 --> 18:38.451
could be persuaded

18:33.112 --> 18:38.451
to make a gesture.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.329
Will you rub my feet?

18:42.371 --> 18:45.917
I would love to rub your feet.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.130
(chuckles)

18:53.883 --> 18:55.593
What can I do for you?

18:55.635 --> 18:58.387
Please leave my balls alone.

18:58.429 --> 19:02.767
Okay.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.603
Mmm...

19:11.233 --> 19:12.276
(knocking)

19:12.318 --> 19:14.654
ANDY:

19:12.318 --> 19:14.654
Sir? Ma'am?

19:14.695 --> 19:17.573
Checkout was two hours ago,

19:14.695 --> 19:17.573
and we really do need the room.

19:17.615 --> 19:18.866
(knocking)

19:18.908 --> 19:19.909
Hello?!

19:26.248 --> 19:27.792
What the hell do

19:26.248 --> 19:27.792
you think you're doing?

19:27.834 --> 19:30.252
I think it would be best

19:27.834 --> 19:30.252
if you left...  now.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.379
That's what you think, huh?

19:32.421 --> 19:33.172
(all laugh)

19:39.178 --> 19:43.307
(nervous,

19:39.178 --> 19:43.307
high-pitched laugh)

19:43.349 --> 19:45.392
Yeah, that's what I think.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.645
Well, I think we're going

19:45.434 --> 19:47.645
to take a pass on that.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.896
Okay, Donnie.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.398
Just remember,

19:48.938 --> 19:51.398
you drove me to this.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.068
Really? What exactly

19:51.440 --> 19:54.068
did we just drive you to?

19:54.110 --> 19:55.653
I told.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.113
(laughter and oohing)

19:57.155 --> 19:58.739
Oh, you  told.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.616
(mock laughter)

20:00.658 --> 20:03.243
I called your moms

20:00.658 --> 20:03.243
and I told on you.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.245
You called my mommy, hmm?

20:05.287 --> 20:06.831
WOMAN:

20:05.287 --> 20:06.831
Donnie?!

20:06.873 --> 20:07.874
Mom?

20:07.915 --> 20:10.168
What-what are you

20:07.915 --> 20:10.168
doing here?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.503
Trying to hide how ashamed I am

20:10.209 --> 20:12.503
at your behavior

20:12.545 --> 20:14.254
and wondering

20:12.545 --> 20:14.254
where I went wrong.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.715
Ma, come on.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.091
Your father and I tried

20:15.756 --> 20:17.091
to give you

20:17.133 --> 20:18.092
the best life possible,

20:18.134 --> 20:19.760
and this is how

20:18.134 --> 20:19.760
we're paid back?

20:19.802 --> 20:20.761
Ma, you don't own me.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.180
I make my own

20:20.803 --> 20:22.180
decisions now.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.306
These  are the decisions

20:22.221 --> 20:24.306
you make?

20:24.348 --> 20:26.308
This  is the life you choose?!

20:26.350 --> 20:27.476
Who's covering

20:26.350 --> 20:27.476
your shift

20:27.518 --> 20:28.477
at the suit outlet?

20:28.519 --> 20:29.896
Dude...

20:29.937 --> 20:31.355
you are  so  busted.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.690
WOMAN 2:

20:31.397 --> 20:32.690
Don't you be

20:31.397 --> 20:32.690
so smug,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.274
David Alan Ferguson.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.276
Believe me, every one

20:34.316 --> 20:36.276
of your stepfathers

20:36.318 --> 20:38.487
is going to hear

20:36.318 --> 20:38.487
about this.

20:38.529 --> 20:39.780
WOMAN 1:

20:38.529 --> 20:39.780
You say good-bye

20:38.529 --> 20:39.780
to your friends

20:39.822 --> 20:43.201
and you get in the car...

20:39.822 --> 20:43.201
right now!

20:45.327 --> 20:47.705
Yeah, see you later.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.705
Uh, bye.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.253
I forgot how good

20:52.334 --> 20:54.253
it feels to tell.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.964
MALCOLM:

20:55.755 --> 20:56.964
Yeah, everything was fine.

20:57.006 --> 20:57.965
You know,

20:58.007 --> 20:59.550
kind of boring.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.301
Quiet, boring.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.262
Fun, but boring.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.599
Look who I picked up

21:04.346 --> 21:06.599
from the bus station

21:06.640 --> 21:08.142
after not having

21:06.640 --> 21:08.142
seen him

21:08.184 --> 21:09.476
since I dropped

21:08.184 --> 21:09.476
him off.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.978
Canada was wonderful.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.313
I brought bananas

21:11.020 --> 21:13.313
back for everybody.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.317
Do you really want to know?

21:17.359 --> 21:19.319
Not really.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.319
No.
