WEBVTT

00:02.830 --> 00:02.899
Well, we're movin'
on up  Movin' on up

00:04.763 --> 00:07.904
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.904 --> 00:12.495
To a deluxe
apartmentin the sky

00:12.495 --> 00:15.187
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.187 --> 00:18.673
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:18.673 --> 00:21.952
We finally gota
piece of the pie

00:23.816 --> 00:26.233
Fish don't fryin the kitchen

00:26.233 --> 00:28.856
Beans don't burnon the grill

00:28.856 --> 00:31.514
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.514 --> 00:33.999
Just to get up that hill

00:33.999 --> 00:36.726
Now we're upin
the big leagues

00:36.726 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.108 --> 00:42.076
As long as we
live,it's you and me, baby

00:42.076 --> 00:43.974
There ain't
nothin' wrongwith that

00:43.974 --> 00:46.529
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.529 --> 00:49.946
To the East Side

Movin' on up

00:57.057 --> 01:00.198
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:00.198 --> 01:06.273
We finally gota
piece of the pie

01:09.483 --> 01:12.141
Hey, Weezy.
Yes?

01:12.141 --> 01:14.143
Will you come on?
It's your bet.

01:14.143 --> 01:16.006
I fold.
Anybody hungry?

01:16.006 --> 01:18.940
We have pretzels,
egg rolls, apple turnovers,

01:18.940 --> 01:24.049
Danish pastry...
Look Weezy, this is a
poker game, not a bake-off.

01:24.049 --> 01:26.879
You wouldn't know it from
the way you're playing.
Look, just...

01:28.260 --> 01:29.572
Just 'cause you got
a lucky streak

01:29.572 --> 01:31.677
don't mean you're
a better poker player
than me.

01:31.677 --> 01:33.576
I know 50 guys
who say I am.

01:35.785 --> 01:39.271
Who?
This guy and this guy
and this guy...

01:41.618 --> 01:43.482
Look will you just
shut up and bet!

01:43.482 --> 01:45.415
George, don't be
a poor loser.

01:45.415 --> 01:47.348
I am not a poor loser!

01:49.592 --> 01:51.490
Now bet!

01:51.490 --> 01:53.251
Let me see my cards.

01:55.184 --> 01:56.702
Ooh-whoo!

02:11.165 --> 02:12.891
Have mercy!

02:16.239 --> 02:17.723
Oh, I'm out!

02:17.723 --> 02:18.931
Good. I didn't have
nothin' either.

02:23.453 --> 02:26.491
She did it to me again!
I'll kill her!

02:26.491 --> 02:28.769
George, sit down.
It's just a game.

02:28.769 --> 02:30.495
All right, gimme
those cards!

02:30.495 --> 02:32.566
Now we're gonna
play a game I can win.

02:32.566 --> 02:34.188
How 'bout Old Maid?

02:36.121 --> 02:37.536
How 'bout no maid?

02:40.953 --> 02:42.783
Don't get
too cocky, Florence.

02:42.783 --> 02:45.372
George was the poker
champion of his ship in the
Navy.

02:45.372 --> 02:46.925
That's right.

02:46.925 --> 02:48.927
What ship was that?
The U.S.S. Chump?

02:51.274 --> 02:53.656
I sure wish I could've
spent a week on your boat.

02:53.656 --> 02:55.105
No way.

02:55.105 --> 02:57.522
It was a war,
but we wasn't that desperate.

02:58.764 --> 03:00.352
Now, here's how
the game goes...

03:00.352 --> 03:02.527
Uh, just a minute, George.
I don't think we
should play anymore.

03:02.527 --> 03:04.011
Why not?

03:04.011 --> 03:06.531
Because you said you
wanted to go to bed early
tonight.

03:06.531 --> 03:08.118
You didn't get any
sleep last night,

03:08.118 --> 03:09.568
and you've been
dead tired all day.

03:09.568 --> 03:12.019
I ain't goin' to sleep
till I win back
my money from her.

03:12.019 --> 03:15.367
Then you're gonna set
the world's record
for staying awake!

03:15.367 --> 03:16.610
Now, listen...

03:16.610 --> 03:18.198
Well, you know
what they say.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.924
The Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away.

03:22.719 --> 03:23.996
I'm ready
to quit myself.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.791
You can't quit!
Why not?

03:25.791 --> 03:27.724
'Cause I'm losin',
that's why not!

03:27.724 --> 03:30.865
That ain't no fat
off of my hocks.

03:30.865 --> 03:33.005
Then give me back my
money. That wasn't a full game.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.663
Look, I won this money,
and I'm gonna keep it.

03:35.663 --> 03:37.044
Not if I take it
from you.

03:37.044 --> 03:39.184
I'd like to see you try.

03:40.530 --> 03:42.601
Okay, I will!

03:42.601 --> 03:44.638
LOUISE:
George! George!

03:44.638 --> 03:46.778
What's the
matter with you?

03:46.778 --> 03:47.986
It was worth it, Weezy.

03:47.986 --> 03:50.299
Now she won't come out
of her room for a week.

03:51.196 --> 03:52.508
Well, it wasn't very nice.

03:52.508 --> 03:54.648
Besides, I'm the one
who asked her to play.

03:54.648 --> 03:58.824
Oh, okay, then you
owe me $9.80.

03:58.824 --> 04:01.206
Okay. I'll give you
a chance to get even.
Ah, that's stupid.

04:01.206 --> 04:03.588
We'll just be tradin'
our own money back.

04:03.588 --> 04:05.866
Oh, we don't have to
play for money.

04:05.866 --> 04:07.350
Then it ain't no fun.

04:07.350 --> 04:09.249
Sure it is.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.492
When we were first married
and we didn't have any money,

04:11.492 --> 04:13.839
we used to play
strip poker.
Remember?

04:13.839 --> 04:15.462
Yeah.

04:15.462 --> 04:16.532
Want to play now?

04:16.532 --> 04:17.878
Oh, forget it, Weez.

04:17.878 --> 04:19.673
Look, playing strip poker
with your wife

04:19.673 --> 04:21.053
is like taking a walk
in your own neighborhood.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.573
You ain't gonna see
nothin' you ain't seen before.

04:26.438 --> 04:28.129
Watch it, George!

04:29.338 --> 04:31.236
Whoever it is,
we ain't home.

04:34.032 --> 04:36.862
Is this
the Jefferson residence?
Yes, it is.

04:36.862 --> 04:38.864
Oh, thank God!

04:38.864 --> 04:42.109
I could've never walked
another step.

04:43.421 --> 04:45.906
Scoot over, honey,
I gotta sit down.

04:48.771 --> 04:50.566
Excuse me, but do we
know who...

04:50.566 --> 04:53.085
I mean, are you sure
you have the right...

04:53.085 --> 04:54.466
How did you get our...

04:54.466 --> 04:58.436
What she's trying
to say is,
who the hell is you?

04:58.436 --> 05:00.265
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:00.265 --> 05:02.440
I was just so tired
from the trip.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.096
I'm Dora Johnston.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.340
Dora Johnston?
Florence's mother.

05:06.858 --> 05:08.238
What?

05:08.238 --> 05:10.344
Well, Florence does
work here, doesn't she?

05:10.344 --> 05:13.209
She picks up
her checks here,
I don't know where she works.

05:14.935 --> 05:17.524
You'll have to forgive
our surprise.

05:17.524 --> 05:19.767
But we didn't think
Florence had any family.

05:19.767 --> 05:21.907
None that would admit it.

05:23.392 --> 05:25.739
You must be
Mrs. Jefferson.

05:25.739 --> 05:29.121
Florence wrote us such
beautiful things about you.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.813
Oh?

05:30.813 --> 05:32.573
And this is
my husband George.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.403
Oh, yeah.

05:35.990 --> 05:39.891
Florence had a few words
to say about you, too.

05:39.891 --> 05:43.204
Florence, can you
come out here, please?

05:43.204 --> 05:45.172
Oh, she's gonna
be so excited.

05:45.172 --> 05:46.932
What a
wonderful surprise.

05:46.932 --> 05:49.245
Now if Mr. Jefferson thinks
he's gonna get his money...

05:49.245 --> 05:51.765
Mama!
Flossie!

05:52.490 --> 05:54.595
Oh, George, look.

05:54.595 --> 05:58.219
Is there anything nicer
than a family reunion?

05:58.219 --> 06:01.188
Yeah, a family leaving
a reunion!

06:01.188 --> 06:03.604
You wouldn't catch me
grabbin', huggin'
and slobberin'

06:03.604 --> 06:05.641
all over my mother
like that.

06:05.641 --> 06:08.195
Of course not,
you'd spill
her Bloody Mary.

06:10.266 --> 06:12.233
Oh, let me look
at you, Florence.

06:12.233 --> 06:14.719
Oh, Mama, this is
the nicest surprise!

06:14.719 --> 06:15.996
Did you just get in?
Uh-huh.

06:15.996 --> 06:17.066
How was your trip?
Oh...

06:17.066 --> 06:18.378
Now, I know
you're gonna stay.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.864
Oh, Mama,
you look so good.
Oh, Mama!

06:21.864 --> 06:25.005
Florence, why didn't
you ever tell me
about your parents?

06:25.005 --> 06:27.248
Why didn't you ever
tell me about yours?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.837
Well, I thought that...

06:29.837 --> 06:32.219
There's a lot of things
I ain't never
told you about.

06:32.219 --> 06:35.360
Like when I was high school,
I was voted Ms. Personality.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.431
Who'd you run
against, Godzilla?

06:41.331 --> 06:43.506
But you always said
you were alone.

06:43.506 --> 06:45.163
Well, I might
as well be.

06:45.163 --> 06:47.372
They've been living
in Vancouver, Canada,
for almost 10 years.

06:47.372 --> 06:49.236
And you sure can't
take the subway there.

06:49.236 --> 06:52.377
Well, you know,
Florence, we had to go
where the work was.

06:52.377 --> 06:54.241
We wanted you
to come with us.

06:54.241 --> 06:57.486
Well, it's never too late.
Take her now!

06:57.486 --> 06:58.866
Don't pay no attention
to him, Mama.

06:58.866 --> 07:00.937
He's just mad because
I beat him at poker.

07:00.937 --> 07:02.145
Don't listen to her.

07:02.145 --> 07:04.285
Look, I ain't slept
for two days.
You can ask Weezy.

07:04.285 --> 07:07.219
The only reason
Florence won tonight
is because I ain't myself.

07:07.219 --> 07:11.361
Mr. Jefferson,
any time you ain't yourself,
we're all winners!

07:16.401 --> 07:18.886
I see you still got
that sharp tongue.

07:18.886 --> 07:20.819
Florence always was
full of sass.

07:20.819 --> 07:23.857
Would you like to see
some pictures of her when
she was a little girl?

07:23.857 --> 07:26.342
Oh, Mama, they don't wanna
see no pictures of me.

07:26.342 --> 07:28.068
You're right
about that!

07:28.068 --> 07:29.863
We'd love to see them.

07:29.863 --> 07:32.693
Look, Weezy, I'm going
to bed. You can handle
the party from here.

07:32.693 --> 07:35.558
Oh, no, George,
don't be rude.

07:35.558 --> 07:38.112
Now can't you just
stick around
for a little while?

07:38.112 --> 07:39.631
I can hardly
keep my eyes open.

07:39.631 --> 07:42.600
And just to look at some
pictures of Florence
ain't no good reason to try.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.809
That's enough, George.
You be nice.

07:44.809 --> 07:46.569
Here they are!
Right on top.

07:46.569 --> 07:48.364
Great.

07:51.022 --> 07:53.818
Do you remember
these, Florence?
Oh, Mama,

07:53.818 --> 07:56.786
did you have to
bring that one?
That's so embarrassing.

07:56.786 --> 08:00.514
Oh, don't
be silly, Florence,
you were just a baby.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.896
Besides, you had such
a cute little behind!

08:04.345 --> 08:06.727
I think I'm
gonna be sick!

08:06.727 --> 08:10.697
Oh, George,
look at this. Yeah.

08:10.697 --> 08:13.562
Florence was
a beautiful child.

08:13.562 --> 08:15.909
It's one of those gifts
you never lose.

08:18.014 --> 08:19.947
Well, it wasn't
always that way.

08:19.947 --> 08:22.571
When I first looked at you
after you were born,

08:22.571 --> 08:24.952
all scrunched up
and wrinkled,

08:24.952 --> 08:26.298
I said to myself,

08:26.298 --> 08:28.853
"Dora, you gotta put
a hat on that kid,

08:28.853 --> 08:31.165
"or they're gonna diaper
the wrong end."

08:36.343 --> 08:37.896
Are you done with
that one, George?

08:38.828 --> 08:40.520
George?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.901
What's so interesting
about that picture?

08:44.006 --> 08:45.490
George!

08:45.490 --> 08:48.424
Huh? Yeah, I really
like this picture.

08:48.424 --> 08:51.531
Too bad
she didn't bring
some more!

08:51.531 --> 08:53.463
Here's a nice one
of you and your father.

08:53.463 --> 08:55.293
Oh, how is daddy?

08:55.293 --> 08:56.846
Oh, he's fine.

08:56.846 --> 08:58.365
I wish he could've
come with you.

08:58.365 --> 09:00.229
Now that would be
kind of silly, Florence.

09:00.229 --> 09:02.507
Especially since we're
going to get a divorce.

09:02.507 --> 09:05.475
A divorce?
Oh, it'll be good
for the both of us.

09:05.475 --> 09:07.581
Oh, Mama!
That's a terrible thing!

09:07.581 --> 09:10.619
Living with him
was a terrible thing.

09:10.619 --> 09:13.276
Mrs. Johnston,
I'm sorry...

09:13.276 --> 09:16.556
Well, I'm not.
We should've
done it years ago.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.248
I feel like somebody
just kicked me
in my stomach.

09:19.248 --> 09:21.975
Oh, Florence,
don't get upset.
It's all for the best.

09:21.975 --> 09:23.459
For the best?
A divorce?

09:23.459 --> 09:26.082
Yeah.
So I thought I'd visit
with my little girl

09:26.082 --> 09:27.946
while the papers
are being drawn up.

09:27.946 --> 09:30.535
I suppose I should
call for a hotel room.

09:30.535 --> 09:32.054
Oh, now, Mama,
you ain't goin'
to no hotel.

09:32.054 --> 09:34.435
You're gonna stay
right here with me.
Right, Mrs. Jefferson?

09:34.435 --> 09:36.196
Why, yes, of course.

09:36.196 --> 09:38.025
She can use
Lionel's old room.

09:38.025 --> 09:40.752
I have to get right back
to meet with the lawyers
again.

09:40.752 --> 09:42.409
Oh, how long
can you stay?

09:42.409 --> 09:43.686
Only a month!

09:43.686 --> 09:44.894
A month?

09:47.621 --> 09:49.865
Come here, Weezy,
I wanna talk to you
right now!

09:51.867 --> 09:54.076
George, I'm not gonna
argue with you.

09:54.076 --> 09:56.561
This is Florence's home, too,
and her mother can stay here.

09:56.561 --> 09:59.219
But why can't
she stay?

09:59.219 --> 10:01.393
Look, I'm all for it,
but Weezy needs
a little convincing.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.464
George!
Weezy!

10:03.464 --> 10:05.674
I'm surprised at you.

10:05.674 --> 10:08.124
Okay, okay. She wants to
talk it over in the kitchen.

10:08.124 --> 10:09.919
Come on,
that's not right.

10:09.919 --> 10:12.163
Come on. Come on.

10:13.371 --> 10:15.028
What's wrong
with you?

10:15.028 --> 10:16.961
I never said
she can't stay here!

10:16.961 --> 10:20.136
No, I'm sayin' it!
Look, this ain't no
Holiday Inn for weirdos.

10:21.586 --> 10:23.243
George,
that's her mother.

10:23.243 --> 10:24.865
I know it's her mother!

10:24.865 --> 10:26.453
Why would I want
the maid's mother
staying here?

10:26.453 --> 10:29.283
I don't even want
the maid herself
staying here!

10:29.283 --> 10:31.078
When Florence
took this job,

10:31.078 --> 10:32.770
we said she could
have guests.

10:32.770 --> 10:35.496
But that's her mother.
She ain't no guest,
she's a relative.

10:35.496 --> 10:37.222
Well, what's
the difference?

10:37.222 --> 10:39.328
A guest is a guest,
a relative is a pest.

10:42.469 --> 10:44.678
Don't be
ridiculous, George.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.576
She looks like
a very nice person
to me.

10:46.576 --> 10:49.027
Oh, Weezy you say that
about everybody.

10:49.027 --> 10:50.857
You wouldn't know
a pain in the butt
if you saw one.

10:53.135 --> 10:54.654
You wanna bet?

10:56.241 --> 10:58.105
Look, Weezy.
All I'm sayin' is...

10:58.105 --> 11:00.867
I know what you're
talking about,
and she's staying!

11:04.629 --> 11:07.045
Oh, c'mon, George.
Let her stay.

11:07.045 --> 11:08.426
Who's she gonna hurt?

11:08.426 --> 11:11.084
Lionel.
Lionel?

11:11.084 --> 11:12.913
Yeah. Now we ain't
got a room for him.

11:12.913 --> 11:16.054
Lionel hasn't lived here
for almost a year!

11:16.054 --> 11:19.057
That's right.
'Cause we aint got
a room for him.

11:19.057 --> 11:21.059
No, because he's married.

11:21.059 --> 11:22.647
Accept it, George.

11:22.647 --> 11:24.338
Oh, look, Weezy,
that don't mean nothing.

11:24.338 --> 11:26.547
With any luck
they probably breaking up
right now.

11:26.547 --> 11:28.411
Well, that is the most
ridiculous thing...

11:28.411 --> 11:30.517
Doorbell! Ha!

11:35.004 --> 11:37.869
That's probably your own son
right now
looking for a place to sleep.

11:40.527 --> 11:41.735
What the hell do you want?

11:41.735 --> 11:44.048
Is this the
Jefferson's residence?
Yeah.

11:44.048 --> 11:45.187
That's what I want.

11:45.187 --> 11:46.671
Daddy!

11:48.673 --> 11:52.263
Don! What are you
doing here?

11:52.263 --> 11:54.403
I came to stay
with my daughter.

12:06.311 --> 12:09.280
I see you couldn't wait
to get here to tell
your side of the story.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.902
Hello, Don.

12:10.902 --> 12:12.662
Too bad you have to leave,

12:12.662 --> 12:15.148
but they only got
one guest room,
and I'm using it.

12:15.148 --> 12:17.426
That's all right.
The couch will be fine.

12:17.426 --> 12:18.668
Oh, no,
it won't be fine!

12:18.668 --> 12:21.119
Ah, don't worry
about me.

12:21.119 --> 12:22.776
I can sleep anywhere.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.260
No, you can't.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.918
Yeah, this is real nice.
Mmm-hmm!

12:26.918 --> 12:29.403
Hey, man,
what are you doin'?
Keep your clothes on!

12:29.403 --> 12:33.269
Look, If she stays,
I stay.

12:33.269 --> 12:34.995
'Cause Florence
is my daughter.

12:34.995 --> 12:36.583
She's my
daughter, too.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.240
Well, she ain't
my daughter,

12:38.240 --> 12:40.552
so you can both
go to a hotel!

12:40.552 --> 12:42.106
Will you
stop it, George?

12:42.106 --> 12:43.521
They have enough
problems already.

12:43.521 --> 12:45.005
They're getting a divorce.

12:45.005 --> 12:46.696
Okay, make that
separate hotels!

12:48.560 --> 12:50.321
Daddy, y'all ain't really
gonna split up?

12:50.321 --> 12:52.185
Look how long
y'all been together.

12:52.185 --> 12:54.014
Forty-five years.
Yeah!

12:54.014 --> 12:55.809
Forty-five of the longest,

12:55.809 --> 12:58.087
most God-awful years
a man can live with.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.298
Forty-six years.

13:02.298 --> 13:03.472
And that's the reason why!

13:03.472 --> 13:05.854
She's been correcting me
all 45 of 'em.

13:07.994 --> 13:09.892
That's such a long time.

13:09.892 --> 13:13.378
Are you sure divorce
is the right thing?

13:13.378 --> 13:16.519
Well, now, I feel kind of
funny answering that.

13:16.519 --> 13:17.866
Why?

13:17.866 --> 13:19.868
'Cause I don't even
know who you are!

13:21.317 --> 13:23.975
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Louise Jefferson.

13:23.975 --> 13:25.839
Oh, pleasure to meet you.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.945
And that's
my husband, George.
Hi.

13:27.945 --> 13:29.774
'Bye!

13:29.774 --> 13:32.570
Let me tell you
something, Louise.

13:32.570 --> 13:35.124
If I hadn't come along
when I did,

13:35.124 --> 13:37.126
she wouldn't be married
to this day.

13:37.126 --> 13:38.783
Don't you
listen to him.

13:38.783 --> 13:41.027
When I was younger,
I was beautiful.

13:41.027 --> 13:42.442
Careful now, Dora,

13:42.442 --> 13:43.684
you remember
I was there!

13:43.684 --> 13:45.445
Let me tell
you one thing...

13:47.481 --> 13:51.416
Mama! Daddy!
Stop it!

13:51.416 --> 13:52.797
Florence,
you might as well
know the truth.

13:52.797 --> 13:55.386
Your father's impossible
to live with.

13:55.386 --> 13:57.146
His habits are
driving me nuts.

13:57.146 --> 14:01.150
He has to brush his teeth
every morning
at exactly 7:42.

14:01.150 --> 14:04.291
When she buys a new book,
she has to read
the end first.

14:04.291 --> 14:05.879
He makes noises
when he drinks.

14:07.674 --> 14:09.918
She makes noises
when she sleeps.

14:12.230 --> 14:14.715
And let's not forget
about the hamburger!

14:14.715 --> 14:16.752
For years I've slaved
over a hot stove,

14:16.752 --> 14:18.271
makin' him everything
in the books.

14:18.271 --> 14:20.687
And how all he'll eat
is hamburger.

14:20.687 --> 14:23.276
Breakfast, lunch,
and dinner.
Hamburger!

14:23.276 --> 14:24.829
And you know why?

14:24.829 --> 14:26.935
'Cause after eating
all your other cooking,

14:26.935 --> 14:29.627
hamburger's the only thing
that will stay down!

14:37.635 --> 14:41.225
Hey, Weezy, I think we
finally found out where
Florence learned how to cook.

14:44.193 --> 14:47.024
George, will you keep
your big mouth shut?

14:47.024 --> 14:50.682
Look, this is my house.
I can do anything I want
with my big mouth!

14:50.682 --> 14:52.305
Can you
make it disappear?

14:54.272 --> 14:55.998
That's telling him,
Mrs. Jefferson!

14:55.998 --> 14:57.827
Look, in a minute
I'm gonna make
you disappear!

14:57.827 --> 15:00.347
If you're gonna talk to
my daughter like that,

15:00.347 --> 15:02.177
you can just
go to your room.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.732
Now, wait a minute.

15:07.354 --> 15:09.667
All right, all right.
That's enough.

15:11.255 --> 15:14.223
I think what we
all need right now

15:14.223 --> 15:16.018
is a good
night's sleep.

15:16.018 --> 15:18.331
Tomorrow morning
everything will
look different.

15:18.331 --> 15:21.541
Mmm-hmm. Especially for
them, 'cause they're gonna wake
up in a hotel.

15:21.541 --> 15:23.853
George!

15:23.853 --> 15:27.064
Okay, now you'll sleep
in Lionel's room,

15:27.064 --> 15:28.962
and you'll sleep out here
on the couch.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.171
Oh, that suits me
just fine.

15:31.171 --> 15:32.621
Sure it does.

15:32.621 --> 15:34.761
You get a nice,
comfortable bed.

15:34.761 --> 15:38.247
All right.
I'll take the couch.
You take the bed.

15:38.247 --> 15:39.455
Why? What's wrong
with the bed?

15:39.455 --> 15:42.286
I'm tired! Just decide
where you wanna sleep.

15:42.286 --> 15:43.839
Wherever you're not.

15:47.532 --> 15:49.465
Hey! Hey!

15:50.328 --> 15:52.986
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

15:52.986 --> 15:54.781
Get out of my way!

15:59.510 --> 16:01.512
FLORENCE: Mrs. Jefferson?

16:01.512 --> 16:05.205
Mrs. Jefferson?
Hmm? What?

16:05.205 --> 16:07.173
Mrs. Jefferson...
Florence?

16:08.139 --> 16:09.761
Can I come in?

16:09.761 --> 16:11.591
George, it's Florence.

16:11.591 --> 16:13.731
Oh, no.
Not in my dreams, too!

16:15.871 --> 16:17.183
What time is it?

16:17.183 --> 16:19.944
Oh, it ain't late,
it's 4:30.
4:30!

16:19.944 --> 16:21.670
Is the building
burning down?
No.

16:21.670 --> 16:23.085
Did somebody die?
No.

16:23.085 --> 16:25.156
Then you're fired!

16:25.156 --> 16:26.675
Oh, stop it, George.

16:26.675 --> 16:28.125
Now what's
the matter, Florence?

16:28.125 --> 16:30.713
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson,
I've just been
tossing and turning.

16:30.713 --> 16:32.577
I can't sleep.

16:32.577 --> 16:35.684
Why don't you just close
your eyes and try
counting unemployment checks?

16:37.927 --> 16:40.378
I'm sorry, but I had
to talk to somebody.

16:40.378 --> 16:41.448
Have you got a minute?

16:41.448 --> 16:43.312
Sure! It's only 4:30.

16:43.312 --> 16:46.108
I got three more hours
before I go to work.

16:46.108 --> 16:48.904
You can talk to me,
Florence. What is it?

16:48.904 --> 16:51.803
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson,
I just been thinking...

16:51.803 --> 16:53.805
About mama and daddy.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.635
I know I shouldn't
be in here.

16:55.635 --> 16:58.189
I should be able to solve
my own problems.

16:58.189 --> 16:59.742
My parents
are getting a divorce!

16:59.742 --> 17:01.365
Weezy!

17:03.746 --> 17:06.473
Oh, you poor girl.
Sit here.

17:06.473 --> 17:08.717
What am I gonna do?

17:08.717 --> 17:11.064
I'm gonna come
from a broken home!

17:11.064 --> 17:14.102
Oh, woman, grow up!
People get divorced
every day.

17:14.102 --> 17:17.105
The fact is,
your parents never
should've gotten married.

17:17.105 --> 17:19.107
George! How can
you say that?

17:19.107 --> 17:20.832
Easy. If they ain't
getting married,

17:20.832 --> 17:23.870
they wouldn't have
had no kids and I'd be
sleeping right now!

17:26.700 --> 17:28.116
Can't you help me,
Mrs. Jefferson?

17:28.116 --> 17:30.359
I know they
really love each other.

17:30.359 --> 17:32.051
Well, what can
I do, Florence?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.673
I'm not a marriage counselor.

17:33.673 --> 17:35.778
But you must
know something.

17:35.778 --> 17:37.849
You managed to
stay with him
all these years.

17:42.337 --> 17:44.822
Well, I'll do what
I can in the morning.

17:44.822 --> 17:47.618
But first, I think you
need to get some rest.

17:47.618 --> 17:48.826
Why don't you
get into bed?

17:48.826 --> 17:51.277
It won't do no good,
I still can't sleep.

17:51.277 --> 17:52.623
Maybe you can now.

17:52.623 --> 17:54.866
Just lie down.
Okay.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.703
Florence!
I didn't mean...

18:03.703 --> 18:06.430
Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Jefferson.
You're so kind.

18:06.430 --> 18:07.707
I didn't want to
be alone.

18:07.707 --> 18:09.329
Uh-uh, Weezy.

18:09.329 --> 18:12.746
I'll do a lot of things
for you, but I ain't
sleepin' with my maid!

18:15.680 --> 18:17.786
DORA: Get out of
here, you. Out!

18:17.786 --> 18:19.098
What the hell is that?

18:19.098 --> 18:21.272
Oh, it's my folks.
They're fighting again.

18:21.272 --> 18:23.723
That's it.
It's all over!
They've had it!

18:23.723 --> 18:25.897
George! What are
you gonna do?
Throw 'em out!

18:25.897 --> 18:27.865
Oh, no, Mr. Jefferson.

18:27.865 --> 18:29.246
Then they'll never
get back together.

18:29.246 --> 18:30.764
Let me go talk to them.
Why?

18:30.764 --> 18:32.352
They ain't gonna
listen to nobody.

18:32.352 --> 18:34.837
Oh, there has
to be a way.

18:34.837 --> 18:36.184
Maybe there is.

18:36.184 --> 18:38.427
When I was a little girl,
they used to
hate to see me cry.

18:38.427 --> 18:40.533
They'd do anything for me
to get me to stop.

18:40.533 --> 18:42.259
So what are you gonna do,
go out there and cry?

18:42.259 --> 18:43.950
Yeah. It'll work,
I know it will.

18:43.950 --> 18:45.917
Okay, you got five
minutes, then I throw 'em out.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.368
But remember,
make sure they ain't
standing by no window,

18:48.368 --> 18:50.405
because when I
start throwing,
I just throw!

18:52.614 --> 18:54.340
You saw me!
I didn't see you.

18:54.340 --> 18:56.100
Yes, you did.
You knew who I was.

18:57.515 --> 19:00.311
Hold it!
Stop it now!

19:00.311 --> 19:02.279
Now what's going
on out here?

19:02.279 --> 19:05.489
I went into your mother's
room to get an extra pillow
and she hit me with it.

19:05.489 --> 19:07.284
It was dark.
I couldn't
see who it was.

19:07.284 --> 19:08.802
You hear that?

19:08.802 --> 19:12.081
Your mother's getting
so old her eyes are going.

19:12.081 --> 19:15.533
Last week she tried to
take a shower in the closet.

19:18.122 --> 19:19.468
Look who's
talking about old.

19:19.468 --> 19:22.299
On a quiet night
you can hear
his hair falling out.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.027
In all the years
I've been married to you,

19:27.027 --> 19:29.168
I can't remember
a quiet night.

19:30.410 --> 19:32.205
That's because you've
got such a big mouth.

19:36.244 --> 19:38.004
Oh, shut up, Florence!

19:38.004 --> 19:39.281
Yeah!

19:43.837 --> 19:46.357
Yeah, I never could stand
your blubbering!

19:47.565 --> 19:49.015
Well, I can't
help it.

19:49.015 --> 19:51.535
You're my folks
and I don't want
you to break up.

19:51.535 --> 19:53.261
Now can't you
talk it over?

19:53.261 --> 19:55.366
I ain't got nothing
to say to him.

19:55.366 --> 19:57.230
I've got nothing
to say to her.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.990
But you ain't giving
yourself a chance

19:58.990 --> 20:01.269
if you don't at least
talk it over.

20:01.269 --> 20:03.788
All right,
we'll talk.

20:03.788 --> 20:06.653
You tell him he's
a stubborn old jackass.

20:06.653 --> 20:09.000
Oh, Mama...
Go on, tell him.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.830
He's a stubborn
old jackass.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.074
Daddy?
Yes, baby girl?

20:14.074 --> 20:15.835
You're a
stubborn old jackass!

20:17.146 --> 20:19.908
Now that's no way to
talk to your father!

20:19.908 --> 20:21.427
I didn't say it,
she did!

20:21.427 --> 20:22.945
Well, then, you
tell her for me.

20:22.945 --> 20:26.846
Daddy, it would help if
you'd say something nice
for a change.

20:28.606 --> 20:30.159
Well, all right.

20:30.988 --> 20:32.576
But just for my little girl.

20:33.508 --> 20:35.234
Dora...

20:35.234 --> 20:37.788
Thank you
for the divorce.

20:37.788 --> 20:40.308
Daddy!
Don't blame me!

20:40.308 --> 20:43.000
I've given that woman
the best years of my life.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.484
I wonder which two
they were.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.905
Hey, hey, look.
All right, that's it,
that's it.

20:51.905 --> 20:53.735
Sit down.
The game is over.
It's all over.

20:53.735 --> 20:55.737
You get over there
and sit down, too.

20:55.737 --> 20:57.635
Now, you listen to me.

20:57.635 --> 21:00.189
He came into my room.
Shut up!

21:00.189 --> 21:01.812
Look, she started the...
Shut up! Shut up!

21:09.406 --> 21:10.717
Now it's my turn.

21:10.717 --> 21:12.132
If you didn't want him
to know where you were,

21:12.132 --> 21:14.134
how come you told him
you were coming here?
I didn't...

21:14.134 --> 21:18.380
Well, it might have
just slipped out...
Uh-huh.

21:18.380 --> 21:21.521
And how come you just
happened to show up here
at the same time she did?

21:21.521 --> 21:23.523
Well, it was just
a coincidence.
I never dreamed...

21:23.523 --> 21:25.456
Yeah, that's what
I wanted to hear.

21:25.456 --> 21:27.976
Now, I got an
announcement to make.

21:27.976 --> 21:29.495
I am George Jefferson.

21:29.495 --> 21:31.151
You are the Johnstons.

21:31.151 --> 21:32.601
My name is on
the rent checks.

21:32.601 --> 21:36.571
Your name is on two
tickets back to Canada. Use 'em!

21:36.571 --> 21:38.262
Uh, now,
just a minute, George.

21:38.262 --> 21:40.713
He's throwing them out!
You said you would help.

21:40.713 --> 21:43.163
She's gonna help.
Weezy, help 'em pack!

21:44.613 --> 21:47.444
George, you just
don't kick people
out of your house.

21:47.444 --> 21:51.171
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You give them a reason first,
then you kick them out.

21:51.171 --> 21:53.346
Okay.
Reason number one,

21:53.346 --> 21:55.521
you ain't nothin'
but troublemakers.

21:55.521 --> 21:58.282
Reason number two,
I don't like you.

21:58.282 --> 22:00.491
And it ain't because
you're Florence's parents.

22:00.491 --> 22:02.044
We all make mistakes.

22:04.633 --> 22:07.084
It's because of
reason number three,

22:07.084 --> 22:09.017
you are fools.

22:09.017 --> 22:12.192
All right, George,
you've said enough.
No, I ain't.

22:12.192 --> 22:14.747
Now look, ever since you
two have been here,
I've been listening to you

22:14.747 --> 22:17.646
just chippin' away
at each other
about every little fault.

22:17.646 --> 22:20.200
I mean, after 46 years
you should know 'em all.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.444
And you should know
they ain't important.

22:22.444 --> 22:26.552
Now, me and Weezy have
been married for 25 years.
And you know why it works?

22:26.552 --> 22:28.519
Because I put up
with all her faults.

22:35.492 --> 22:37.252
And she's do the
same for me,

22:37.252 --> 22:38.805
if I had any.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.569
At your age you're lucky
to have each other.

22:43.569 --> 22:45.985
Look, I know how much
Weezy means to me.

22:45.985 --> 22:48.125
And you should know how
much you mean to each other.

22:48.125 --> 22:50.576
Now, if you want to
throw all that away,
you go right ahead.

22:50.576 --> 22:52.405
But that just makes
you damn fools.

22:52.405 --> 22:53.820
And you can just do it
somewhere else.

23:04.279 --> 23:06.177
Boy, he really
told you off.

23:20.329 --> 23:21.779
Oh, George...

23:21.779 --> 23:23.574
I'm sorry, Weezy,
I just had to say it.

23:23.574 --> 23:26.059
I know.
And you did it so well.

23:26.059 --> 23:27.613
Huh?
Come here.

23:38.693 --> 23:40.142
See that, Weezy?

23:40.142 --> 23:41.799
Sometimes you
got to be tough.

23:41.799 --> 23:45.734
Of course it helps when
you're the type
that commands respect.

23:45.734 --> 23:48.012
Don't spoil it, George.

23:48.012 --> 23:49.635
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Jefferson.

23:49.635 --> 23:51.153
My pleasure, Florence.

23:51.153 --> 23:53.708
I should've known
they'd be crazy enough
to listen to you.

23:55.537 --> 23:58.195
Yeah, I figure I'll give
her one more chance.

23:58.195 --> 24:02.406
I guess I'm kinda sorta
used to him by now.

24:02.406 --> 24:04.926
Oh, I'm so glad
to hear that.

24:04.926 --> 24:07.446
They even decided
to start this trip
all over again

24:07.446 --> 24:09.068
and make it
a second honeymoon.

24:09.068 --> 24:11.208
Ah! Now that's what
I wanted to hear!

24:11.208 --> 24:12.520
When are you
gonna start?

24:12.520 --> 24:14.211
Right now.
GEORGE: Hey, good!

24:14.211 --> 24:15.937
Now I can get some sleep.

24:15.937 --> 24:18.767
By the way, where are
they going to spend
their honeymoon?

24:18.767 --> 24:20.044
In Lionel's room.

24:46.761 --> 24:50.799
LOUISE: The Jeffersonswas
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

25:01.948 --> 25:03.743
Movin',
movin' on up
