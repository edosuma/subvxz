straight to us, aren't you?

Aang didn't do anything.

01:21.090 --> 01:22.590
It was an accident.

01:22.670 --> 01:24.090
Yeah, we were on the ship

and there was this booby trap,

01:25.260 --> 01:27.050
and, well, we―

01:27.130 --> 01:28.470
We boobied right into it.

Katara, you shouldn't have
gone on that ship.

Now we could all be in danger.

Don't blame Katara.

Don't you see?

Aang's brought us something

we haven't had in a long time― Fun.

Fun? We can't fight firebenders

Grandmother, please,
don't let Sokka do this.

Katara, you knew going on
that ship was forbidden.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.640
Sokka is right.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.310
I think it best
if the airbender leaves.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.230
Fine, then I'm banished, too.

02:21.310 --> 02:22.900
Come on, Aang, let's go.

over your tribe,

Katara, I don't want to come between

20:55.840 --> 20:57.840
Well, if we go to the north pole,

20:57.930 --> 20:59.890
you can master waterbending.

20:59.970 --> 21:01.310
We could learn it together!

21:01.810 --> 21:03.890
And, Sokka,
I'm sure you'll get to knock

21:03.980 --> 21:05.600
some firebender heads on the way.

21:05.890 --> 21:06.940
I'd like that.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.480
I'd really like that.

21:09.150 --> 21:10.860
Then we're in this together.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.900
All right,
but before I learn waterbending,

21:12.980 --> 21:15.570
we have some
serious business to attend to

21:15.650 --> 21:18.030
here, here, and here.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.700
What's there?

21:19.780 --> 21:21.870
Here we'll ride the hopping llamas.

21:21.950 --> 21:25.040
Then way over here we'll surf
on the backs of giant koi fish.

21:25.370 --> 21:27.870
Then back over here
we'll ride the hog monkeys.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.750
They don't like people riding them,

21:29.830 --> 21:31.250
but that's what makes it fun!
