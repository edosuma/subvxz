01:18.620 --> 01:20.955
<i>'Twas the night before Christmas</i>

01:20.955 --> 01:22.916
<i>And all through the house</i>

01:22.916 --> 01:26.085
<i>Mrs. Two Shoes made
last-minute preparations</i>

01:26.085 --> 01:29.297
<i>For her cat and her mouse</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:33.593
<i>As Tom curled up
Snug in his bed, fast asleep</i>

01:33.593 --> 01:35.845
<i>The tin soldiers stood guard</i>

01:35.845 --> 01:39.432
<i>And from Jerry, not a peep</i>

01:42.435 --> 01:45.271
<i>As stockings were filled
and stuffed to the brim</i>

01:46.648 --> 01:50.735
<i>The catnap took Tom
to the dream world within</i>

05:27.493 --> 05:28.536
<i>Ho, ho, ho.</i>

05:36.169 --> 05:38.588
<i>Ho, ho, ho.</i>

07:24.110 --> 07:25.695
<i>As the next morning came</i>

07:25.695 --> 07:28.197
<i>Mrs. Two Shoes, excited</i>

07:28.197 --> 07:32.869
<i>Ran down the stairs
But she wasn't delighted</i>

07:33.911 --> 07:37.915
<i>For what she saw
Along with Tom and Jerry at rest</i>

07:37.915 --> 07:42.753
<i>Was a big steaming pile
Of nasty "Christmess"</i>

07:42.753 --> 07:44.881
<i>At first she was angry</i>

07:44.881 --> 07:47.341
<i>She was fit to be tied</i>

07:47.717 --> 07:51.429
<i>She made the two critters
Brave the weather outside</i>

07:54.974 --> 07:57.768
<i>But all is forgiven
This one day in December</i>

07:57.768 --> 08:00.271
<i>When foes become friends</i>

08:01.731 --> 08:04.609
<i>On a holiday to remember</i>

10:55.946 --> 10:57.615
Phew.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.914
You two slay me.

11:04.914 --> 11:10.044
Just stay out of my way, and I'll shows
you how a real sledder takes a hill.

11:13.339 --> 11:18.052
I declare myself, Spike, king of the hill.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.901
Make way for the king.

11:40.491 --> 11:45.746
You boys are a regular laugh riot.
Better call in the law. Ha-ha!

11:56.257 --> 11:57.258
Gangway.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.770
Thanks, fellas.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.781
Make way for King Spike.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.295
Here, kitty, kitty.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.143
What are you two looking at?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.687
Admiring my sled, are you?

12:51.687 --> 12:54.690
Well, I dares you to lick it.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.528
It would be better for your health
if you did, cat.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.661
Now it's your turn.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.334
There.

13:15.252 --> 13:19.131
Let's go for a ride, shall we?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.425
What's the matter? Tongue-tied?

13:24.929 --> 13:28.349
I'm Spike, king of the hill.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.396
Let's roll.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.533
Oh, yeah.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.452
Naughty boys.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.127
Thanks, fellas.

14:38.127 --> 14:41.797
That was the best holiday fun ever.

14:44.008 --> 14:48.929
I wanna show you my appreciation
for all that youse done for me.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.937
We're gonna have fun all winter long.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.503
<i>The Arctic wastes...</i>

15:21.503 --> 15:26.342
<i>...where only the hardy
of soul and spirit dare venture.</i>

15:26.342 --> 15:29.386
<i>Where nature runs rampant...</i>

15:29.386 --> 15:33.682
<i>...testing the very mettle
of all creatures great...</i>

15:33.682 --> 15:35.517
<i>...and not so great.</i>

15:37.436 --> 15:38.937
Hmph.

16:03.837 --> 16:04.797
Huh?

16:08.384 --> 16:10.010
Hmph. Huh?
