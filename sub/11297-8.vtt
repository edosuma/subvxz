WEBVTT

00:00.030 --> 00:01.199
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.123 --> 00:04.051
They're calling us a
controversial fringe movement.

00:04.053 --> 00:05.992
This is Evelyn Hernandez,

00:05.992 --> 00:07.001
and these are her kids.

00:07.002 --> 00:08.061
She needs our help.

00:08.061 --> 00:09.921
If darkness falls...

00:09.922 --> 00:11.041
We are Light.

00:11.821 --> 00:13.760
I was looking for Sean.

00:13.761 --> 00:16.690
I need a good man on
the ground in Milton.

00:16.691 --> 00:17.840
Why did you send him away?

00:19.721 --> 00:20.750
You work in the infirmary, right?

00:20.751 --> 00:21.830
Uh-huh.

00:21.831 --> 00:24.710
You know what would really help me?

00:24.711 --> 00:25.770
You haven't been honest.

00:25.771 --> 00:27.730
You said there was no Light.

00:27.731 --> 00:28.830
I want you to take the Walk.

00:28.831 --> 00:31.880
And if you find that you
are still faithless,

00:31.881 --> 00:32.890
don't come back.

00:32.891 --> 00:35.810
I can't see you anymore.

00:35.811 --> 00:37.760
I want to walk with you.

00:37.761 --> 00:38.760
- Son, you, uh...
- Please.

00:38.761 --> 00:39.810
I need to.

00:39.811 --> 00:41.700
Silas, what are you doing here?

00:41.701 --> 00:44.700
It's over. The Movement is dead.

00:44.701 --> 00:46.850
You're an alcoholic salesman.

00:48.761 --> 00:49.910
Argh!

00:49.911 --> 00:51.751
No, no, no!

02:28.391 --> 02:29.470
Oh, shit.

02:31.521 --> 02:32.550
Can I help you?

02:32.551 --> 02:34.680
Oh, yeah. Hey, Isiah.

02:34.681 --> 02:37.580
My, uh, keys.

02:37.581 --> 02:38.660
Where you headed this late?

02:38.661 --> 02:40.520
You know... couldn't sleep.

02:40.521 --> 02:41.660
Just thought I'd take a drive.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.560
I bet.

02:43.561 --> 02:44.690
We're all on pins and needles tonight.

02:44.691 --> 02:46.680
Yeah.

02:46.681 --> 02:48.570
Hey, uh, you need anything,

02:48.571 --> 02:49.660
you let me know.

02:49.661 --> 02:51.660
Yeah, I'll do that. Thanks, man.

03:23.521 --> 03:24.580
Oh, fuck.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.671
Okay...

04:11.651 --> 04:12.680
How much?

04:15.631 --> 04:19.550
My daughter... how much
you gonna pay me for her?

04:22.641 --> 04:25.640
Next time I see you,

04:25.641 --> 04:28.640
I finish the job.

04:56.691 --> 04:59.570
Argh!

06:10.531 --> 06:12.630
Hawk!

06:16.521 --> 06:22.650
Hawk! Hawk!

06:22.651 --> 06:27.510
Someone!

06:27.511 --> 06:30.590
No!

07:16.561 --> 07:17.680
How you feeling?

07:17.681 --> 07:19.600
Hungry.

07:19.601 --> 07:21.580
Oh, you can't be hungry already.

07:21.581 --> 07:22.690
You know how long we have to go?

07:22.691 --> 07:25.650
Messing with you, Dad. I'm fine.

07:25.651 --> 07:27.610
Hey.

07:27.611 --> 07:29.570
You sure about this?

07:29.571 --> 07:31.580
You can always just walk
right across the street,

07:31.581 --> 07:33.560
wait a minute.

07:33.561 --> 07:36.660
They got buses that
go back all the time.

07:36.661 --> 07:39.680
I'm sure.

07:39.681 --> 07:43.510
Well, this is it.

07:43.511 --> 07:46.630
This is where it all began.

07:46.631 --> 07:48.630
You know, Steve was doing top secret

07:48.631 --> 07:50.620
psychological warfare in there...

07:50.621 --> 07:53.530
experimenting on
soldiers, Vietnam vets.

07:53.531 --> 07:54.650
And one day it hits him.

07:54.651 --> 07:57.620
This is messed up.

07:57.621 --> 08:00.540
And he just walks out
through those gates,

08:00.541 --> 08:03.660
leaving his life in the Army behind.

08:03.661 --> 08:06.580
Well, leaving everything else as well.

08:06.581 --> 08:08.520
No idea what was ahead of him.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.660
Just knew he couldn't do
what he was doing anymore.

08:10.661 --> 08:13.540
Can I assist you gentlemen?

08:13.541 --> 08:14.680
Uh, no thank you, sir. We're just...

08:14.681 --> 08:17.670
You mind taking your hands
out of the bags, please?

08:17.671 --> 08:19.580
Yeah, we're just on a walk.

08:19.581 --> 08:20.721
- Just passing through.
- Uhhuh.

08:24.671 --> 08:25.740
And the rocks?

08:25.741 --> 08:27.660
We leave them at every stop,

08:27.661 --> 08:29.640
lightening our physical substance...

08:29.641 --> 08:32.721
Really, it's just for exercise.

10:06.371 --> 10:07.490
Government
has issued what's called

10:07.491 --> 10:10.380
a stay of removal,
essentially calling Uncle

10:10.381 --> 10:13.510
after a standoff at the
Meyerist compound.

10:13.511 --> 10:16.320
The fringe religious
movement was successful

10:16.321 --> 10:18.380
at getting declared a protected space,

10:18.381 --> 10:20.310
meaning the removal of
the Honduran immigrants,

10:20.311 --> 10:21.340
along with their children,

10:21.341 --> 10:22.530
has been indefinitely delayed.

10:22.531 --> 10:24.410
She is.

10:27.411 --> 10:28.490
Ready?

10:38.511 --> 10:40.490
Whoo!

10:45.381 --> 10:47.430
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

10:47.431 --> 10:49.320
You... this is...

10:49.321 --> 10:50.520
this is not necessary.

10:50.521 --> 10:52.530
We are so proud of you.

10:52.531 --> 10:56.340
The Light has never shined
more brightly through you,

10:56.341 --> 10:58.340
or more powerfully.

10:58.341 --> 10:59.490
You've always been the
guide in our family,

10:59.491 --> 11:03.330
and to see you up there
guiding the whole Movement,

11:03.331 --> 11:04.350
it was... it was just...

11:04.351 --> 11:07.380
- Okay.
- Thank you, everyone.

11:07.381 --> 11:09.420
Is the Sarah parade over?

11:09.421 --> 11:12.340
'Cause this baby is
knocking on the door.

11:12.341 --> 11:13.360
Come on.

11:13.361 --> 11:15.320
Let's get you off your feet.

11:15.321 --> 11:16.400
Okay, thank you, everyone...

11:16.401 --> 11:17.490
really.

11:17.491 --> 11:19.380
Hey, you two.

11:20.501 --> 11:22.500
All right, I'm gonna go
put these in some water.

11:22.501 --> 11:25.470
Thank you.

11:25.471 --> 11:27.430
Sarah, Sarah...

11:27.431 --> 11:29.390
I'd love to have a little
private chat with you later,

11:29.391 --> 11:31.310
woman to woman.

11:31.311 --> 11:32.480
Is that something you'd be open to?

11:32.481 --> 11:33.510
Of course.

11:33.511 --> 11:35.310
Okay, I'll track you down.

11:35.311 --> 11:38.400
Okay.

14:38.401 --> 14:40.320
Good morning, friends.

14:40.321 --> 14:41.400
Oh, my God, sir.

14:41.401 --> 14:42.460
Um, hello.

14:42.461 --> 14:43.530
We didn't...

14:43.531 --> 14:45.370
we had no idea you
were coming, or we...

14:45.371 --> 14:47.510
We're, um... this isn't mine.

14:47.511 --> 14:50.510
It's okay.

14:50.511 --> 14:53.390
I'm here for Sean.

14:53.391 --> 14:55.320
Cal is reckless,

14:55.321 --> 14:56.520
and he will bring The Movement down.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.480
His demons will get the better of him.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.510
No one has seen him since last night.

15:01.511 --> 15:03.340
And this is not the first time

15:03.341 --> 15:04.510
he's been unpredictable recently.

15:04.511 --> 15:06.470
Isn't that so?

15:06.471 --> 15:09.340
It's been a challenging time.

15:09.341 --> 15:12.520
I know you and Cal have
a special relationship.

15:12.521 --> 15:14.480
But this is bigger than that.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.470
Change is coming, as Steve prophesied,

15:17.471 --> 15:19.490
at the highest levels of our Movement.

15:19.491 --> 15:21.380
I just want you to breathe a little

15:21.381 --> 15:23.390
on the possibility of taking

15:23.391 --> 15:25.400
a bigger leadership role

15:25.401 --> 15:28.320
when that change comes.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.330
Silas...

15:36.331 --> 15:38.350
That does resemble one of his...

15:40.331 --> 15:42.390
One of his Pachamama idols.

15:42.391 --> 15:44.330
But what is it doing here?

15:50.371 --> 15:53.330
Look at these whackos.
This is ridiculous.

15:53.331 --> 15:54.540
Yeah, you can imagine what
it's costing the taxpayers.

15:54.541 --> 15:56.500
I can't believe we're wasting
our resources on this.

15:56.501 --> 15:57.510
It's bullshit.

15:57.511 --> 15:59.350
Come on, turn that shit off.

15:59.351 --> 16:00.380
Why are you so upset?

16:00.381 --> 16:01.500
Because it's nonsense.

16:01.501 --> 16:03.480
It's just a bunch of political theater.

16:03.481 --> 16:05.490
I thought you were against
deporting the aliens.

16:05.491 --> 16:08.310
First of all, it's undocumented.

16:08.311 --> 16:10.510
No one says aliens anymore. Jesus.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.510
You know, nothing's
getting solved here.

16:12.511 --> 16:15.410
It's just Uncle Sam kicking
a can down the road

16:15.411 --> 16:16.490
as per usual.

16:16.491 --> 16:18.390
When you have a murderous cult

16:18.391 --> 16:20.470
doing more good than they are,

16:20.471 --> 16:22.340
then you know we got problems.

16:22.341 --> 16:23.360
You don't have a murder
case yet, do you?

16:23.361 --> 16:24.520
I'm working on it.

16:24.521 --> 16:26.460
Yeah, I sent out to get
Jason Kemp's police report,

16:26.461 --> 16:28.350
but it's...

16:28.351 --> 16:29.510
you know, getting paperwork out of Peru

16:29.511 --> 16:31.430
is worse than FEMA.

16:31.431 --> 16:33.500
Agent Gaines, mind if I have a word?

16:33.501 --> 16:36.430
Uh, yeah. Of course.

16:36.431 --> 16:37.490
I was wondering if you
could find the time

16:37.491 --> 16:39.500
to have a meal with me... a thank you

16:39.501 --> 16:41.350
for all your hard work.

16:41.351 --> 16:43.420
Wow, boss wants to take me to lunch.

16:43.421 --> 16:44.490
You know I have no problem with that.

16:44.491 --> 16:46.400
Well, I was thinking dinner.

16:46.401 --> 16:47.470
You and your wife join me
and the missus at a club,

16:47.471 --> 16:49.390
say, tomorrow night?

16:49.391 --> 16:50.540
Of course, of course.

16:50.541 --> 16:53.420
You know, I just, uh, need
to check the calendar,

16:53.421 --> 16:55.380
but, um...

16:55.381 --> 16:57.500
- Well, let me know.
- Mm-hmm.

16:57.501 --> 16:59.370
Well, you know... well,
you know, you know,

16:59.371 --> 17:00.430
I... I... I'll check...
check the calendar.

17:00.431 --> 17:01.520
My, my, my.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.450
Someone's moving up in the world.

17:03.451 --> 17:04.530
It's just a thank you dinner.

17:04.531 --> 17:06.430
At his private club? No way.

17:06.431 --> 17:08.480
This is a promotion, you piece of shit.

17:08.481 --> 17:10.480
You bring in one big case...

17:10.481 --> 17:12.359
It's just a dinner.

17:12.361 --> 17:13.480
All I'm saying is,

17:13.481 --> 17:15.430
I've never been invited
to his private club.

17:15.431 --> 17:17.410
Of course not. I mean,
man, look at you.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.480
How long have you had that jacket?

17:25.521 --> 17:28.349
It's not vegetarian.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.350
No, it is not.

17:30.351 --> 17:32.390
Just 'cause we're hungry
doesn't mean we should eat...

17:32.391 --> 17:34.430
We take what we are given.

17:34.431 --> 17:35.471
Come on.

17:47.531 --> 17:49.440
Nice boots.

17:49.441 --> 17:51.370
Better keep those on tonight.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.480
Easy, friend.

17:52.481 --> 17:54.440
I ain't your friend.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.520
All right, back the fuck up.

17:56.521 --> 18:00.370
Back the fuck up right now.

18:27.461 --> 18:30.350
You okay?

18:30.351 --> 18:32.360
Yeah.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.360
Just feel like I have bugs all over me.

18:34.361 --> 18:35.480
Probably just a feeling, though.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.450
Yeah, maybe.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.410
You good there?

18:44.411 --> 18:46.350
They had beds in the other room.

18:46.351 --> 18:47.500
No, not gonna leave you.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.500
I'm fine.

18:58.501 --> 19:01.500
Ashley's mom freaked out.

19:03.341 --> 19:05.390
Took them to the YWCA.

19:09.421 --> 19:12.400
Thinks we're freaks.

19:12.401 --> 19:16.360
Doesn't want Ashley to have
anything to do with me

19:16.361 --> 19:17.440
if I'm in The Movement.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.360
Okay.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.460
What are you gonna do?

19:25.521 --> 19:29.340
Keep walking till I figure it out.

19:51.071 --> 19:54.190
Hey, bud. Hey.

19:54.191 --> 19:57.161
We should probably get going
if we're gonna make our miles.

20:03.061 --> 20:04.230
Hey, Dad, um...

20:04.231 --> 20:07.090
If anyone would like to join
me in a morning prayer?

20:07.091 --> 20:08.180
It's not obligatory.

20:08.181 --> 20:10.090
You still get breakfast if you don't.

20:10.091 --> 20:11.210
But for some of us,

20:11.211 --> 20:14.080
it's a nourishing way to start the day.

20:14.081 --> 20:16.180
So join in if you know it.

20:16.181 --> 20:21.180
Lord, make me an
instrument of thy peace.

20:21.181 --> 20:24.200
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.

20:26.211 --> 20:30.220
Where there is injury, pardon.

20:30.221 --> 20:33.230
Where there is doubt, faith.

20:35.081 --> 20:37.160
Where there is despair, hope.

20:39.101 --> 20:42.170
Where there's darkness, light.

20:42.171 --> 20:44.240
Where there is sadness, joy.

20:44.241 --> 20:47.140
O Divine Master, grant that I may not

20:47.141 --> 20:50.130
so much seek to be consoled

20:50.131 --> 20:52.180
as to console,

20:52.181 --> 20:55.220
to be understood as to understand,

20:55.221 --> 20:58.100
to be loved as to love.

20:58.101 --> 21:00.210
For it is in giving that we receive,

21:00.211 --> 21:03.060
it is pardoning that we are pardoned,

21:03.061 --> 21:05.180
and it is dying that we are born

21:05.181 --> 21:08.161
to eternal life.

21:10.141 --> 21:12.090
How about a "thank you, Mommy"?

21:12.091 --> 21:14.070
Daddy's are a lot fluffier.

21:14.071 --> 21:15.130
You haven't even tried it.

21:15.131 --> 21:17.130
Just taste it.

21:17.131 --> 21:20.160
And he makes banana eyes
and a blueberry mouth.

21:20.161 --> 21:23.110
Hey, I invented the blueberry mouth.

21:23.111 --> 21:25.190
What, you don't believe me?

21:25.191 --> 21:27.091
Watch this.

21:41.071 --> 21:44.230
Cal?

21:44.231 --> 21:46.150
Where have you been?

21:46.151 --> 21:48.070
I need help.

21:48.071 --> 21:50.030
Okay. Come on.

21:50.031 --> 21:51.240
Let's go straight upstairs, okay?

21:51.241 --> 21:54.150
You can take a shower; you can
put on something of Eddie's.

21:54.151 --> 21:56.210
Sarah...

21:56.211 --> 21:58.180
Let's just get you
cleaned up, all right?

21:58.181 --> 21:59.221
Come with me.

22:23.201 --> 22:25.140
You're here.

22:25.141 --> 22:27.220
Cal came and got me.

22:27.221 --> 22:31.080
He did? Why?

22:31.081 --> 22:33.181
He said this was where
I'm supposed to be.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.090
Thank you, William.

22:57.091 --> 22:59.050
This is so nice.

22:59.051 --> 23:00.110
Thanks for coming here.

23:00.111 --> 23:01.200
It's just easier.

23:01.201 --> 23:03.110
We never go to restaurants anymore.

23:03.111 --> 23:04.220
You can't hear yourself talk.

23:04.221 --> 23:08.020
We don't go anywhere
anymore, period.

23:08.021 --> 23:09.170
Kids.

23:09.171 --> 23:11.170
We'll all do
the pot pie, William.

23:11.171 --> 23:12.230
Thanks.

23:12.231 --> 23:14.060
It's Thursday.

23:18.121 --> 23:19.120
Thank you.

23:19.121 --> 23:20.240
Well, Abe.

23:20.241 --> 23:24.060
I want to thank you for
your outstanding service

23:24.061 --> 23:25.160
to the department.

23:25.161 --> 23:28.100
Your hard work and your
excellent instincts

23:28.101 --> 23:29.140
have done us proud.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.100
Thank you.

23:31.101 --> 23:34.230
And your family has made sacrifices.

23:34.231 --> 23:37.190
And I want to thank you
both personally for that...

23:37.191 --> 23:40.200
and to give you some news.

23:40.201 --> 23:43.060
We are officially done

23:43.061 --> 23:46.120
with the Meyerist case.

23:46.121 --> 23:49.210
Excuse me, I'm... I'm not following.

23:49.211 --> 23:52.220
Well, with all the press
around the immigrant standoff,

23:52.221 --> 23:55.140
State Senator De Graw took an interest.

23:55.141 --> 23:57.090
He got Homeland Security involved.

23:57.091 --> 24:00.120
So they'll be taking over from here.

24:00.121 --> 24:02.100
Um...

24:02.101 --> 24:03.100
No, this is a good thing.

24:03.101 --> 24:04.240
Our department did the leg work.

24:04.241 --> 24:06.210
We get the credit for that,
and now DHS handles it.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.170
What's this State Senator De Graw?

24:08.171 --> 24:10.070
Isn't that the guy

24:10.071 --> 24:12.210
that's making a play
for Attorney General?

24:12.211 --> 24:15.020
Well, I try to stay out of that.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.220
No, but you and I know what that is.

24:16.221 --> 24:18.150
- Honey, I don't think...
- It's politics.

24:18.151 --> 24:20.060
This is not about enforcing the law.

24:20.061 --> 24:22.180
It's just some idiot
politician decides...

24:22.181 --> 24:23.220
- Abe...
- No.

24:23.221 --> 24:25.070
You know what? I'm sorry.

24:25.071 --> 24:27.010
But do you know what's gonna happen?

24:27.011 --> 24:28.110
Nothing.

24:28.111 --> 24:30.220
This case gets kicked
over to the IRS...

24:30.221 --> 24:32.140
for years.

24:32.141 --> 24:34.060
We're talking about a potential murder

24:34.061 --> 24:36.060
that these people have committed.

24:36.061 --> 24:38.040
I mean, at least one.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.010
Maybe more.

24:40.011 --> 24:42.230
It's typical government bullshit.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.030
Agent Gaines, I'm gonna have to ask you

24:44.031 --> 24:45.130
to watch your language.

24:45.131 --> 24:47.170
The only thing more fucked up than DHS

24:47.171 --> 24:49.020
is FEMA.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.050
So maybe they can bring those guys in

24:51.051 --> 24:52.190
and get my fucking house fixed!

24:52.191 --> 24:54.150
Abe, if you can't get
a hold of yourself-

24:54.151 --> 24:57.030
You know what? I
fucking hate pot pie!

25:08.171 --> 25:10.140
One tea, two mugs.

25:10.141 --> 25:11.200
Anything else?

25:11.201 --> 25:13.150
That is it. Thank you.

25:19.201 --> 25:22.060
We could split one piece.

25:22.061 --> 25:24.070
We have enough.

25:24.071 --> 25:26.150
Uh, for now.

25:26.151 --> 25:30.120
But we don't know what's coming.

25:30.121 --> 25:33.150
So I think that we can probably

25:33.151 --> 25:37.040
make it to the next shelter tonight.

25:37.041 --> 25:39.050
But if not, I think we
should probably stay here

25:39.051 --> 25:40.160
until it warms up a little.

25:44.191 --> 25:47.190
Did you stop loving Mom?

25:47.191 --> 25:49.130
Buddy...

25:49.131 --> 25:50.180
When you had your thing with...

25:50.181 --> 25:52.200
I know what you're gonna say.

25:55.051 --> 25:57.050
My...

25:57.051 --> 25:59.160
Transgress in Peru

25:59.161 --> 26:01.150
had nothing to do with the love I have

26:01.151 --> 26:04.050
for your mother.

26:04.051 --> 26:06.030
Come on.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.190
I-I tell you stuff...

26:08.191 --> 26:11.010
real stuff, and you
talk to me like that...

26:11.011 --> 26:12.010
like we're in session.

26:12.011 --> 26:14.130
Hey, that's the truth.

26:14.131 --> 26:15.160
Come on.

26:15.161 --> 26:17.050
What... what happened?

26:17.051 --> 26:19.150
I mean, if I can't
even have pie, just...

26:19.151 --> 26:23.170
Look, I was just going
through something

26:23.171 --> 26:26.170
where I was trying to find

26:26.171 --> 26:28.220
where I really belong...

26:28.221 --> 26:30.120
if that makes any sense.

26:30.121 --> 26:32.130
Did you?

26:32.131 --> 26:35.030
Did you find...

26:36.191 --> 26:37.230
What you were looking for?

26:41.131 --> 26:43.130
Where are you boys headed?

26:43.131 --> 26:45.060
Excuse me?

26:45.061 --> 26:48.020
We saw you outside in
the freezing cold.

26:48.021 --> 26:50.200
Surely you're headed somewhere.

26:50.201 --> 26:52.180
Thought it would be
Christian thing to do

26:52.181 --> 26:54.030
to offer you ride.

26:54.031 --> 26:55.110
Oh.

26:55.111 --> 26:57.220
Wow, well, that is very kind of you,

26:57.221 --> 27:02.060
but, uh, we are actually
on a walk, so...

27:02.061 --> 27:03.120
In the middle of winter?

27:03.121 --> 27:05.020
We are headed to Brighton Beach,

27:05.021 --> 27:09.030
so if you are going anywhere
in that direction...

27:09.031 --> 27:11.130
Brighton Beach? My dad grew up there.

27:11.131 --> 27:12.180
No kidding.

27:12.181 --> 27:14.160
Well, not really.

27:14.161 --> 27:16.200
We used to go to Coney Island as a kid,

27:16.201 --> 27:18.020
you know, summers.

27:18.021 --> 27:19.180
Get into trouble.

27:19.181 --> 27:21.160
Is that where you are going now?

27:21.161 --> 27:23.120
We have a couple of, uh,

27:23.121 --> 27:25.230
warm spots in the back seat for you.

27:28.171 --> 27:30.140
It's fate, Dad. Come on.

28:13.151 --> 28:16.010
Mom, is Uncle Cal gonna be okay?

28:16.011 --> 28:17.160
Go back to bed, honey. It's late.

28:17.161 --> 28:18.210
What's wrong with him?

28:18.211 --> 28:20.050
Did he transgress?

28:20.051 --> 28:21.240
Not every illness is of spirit.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.101
Some are just of body.

28:26.041 --> 28:27.040
How you doing?

28:27.041 --> 28:28.240
Uh, better, yeah.

28:28.241 --> 28:31.050
Sorry if I, uh, disturbed you.

28:31.051 --> 28:32.160
No, I was up.

28:32.161 --> 28:34.010
Nicole's been texting me.

28:34.011 --> 28:35.120
It sounds like she's in early labor.

28:35.121 --> 28:37.050
- I might head over there soon.
- All right.

28:37.051 --> 28:38.200
You woke me up.

28:38.201 --> 28:40.120
You sound awful.

28:40.121 --> 28:42.050
It's... it's all right.

28:42.051 --> 28:43.240
It's just leaving your system.

28:43.241 --> 28:46.140
I'll get you some more water.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.200
Good night, honey.

28:47.201 --> 28:48.200
Are you gonna stay with us

28:48.201 --> 28:50.040
until Daddy gets back?

28:50.041 --> 28:51.130
He's gonna stay with us

28:51.131 --> 28:52.190
until he gets feeling better.

28:52.191 --> 28:54.070
We help people who need us, right?

28:54.071 --> 28:58.051
- Like the immigrants.
- Like the immigrants.

29:04.141 --> 29:06.151
I'm not... I'm not all right.

29:08.171 --> 29:09.240
Come here.

29:09.241 --> 29:13.170
I want to show you something.

29:13.171 --> 29:15.010
What am I looking at?

29:15.011 --> 29:16.050
Donations...

29:16.051 --> 29:18.110
from the website.

29:18.111 --> 29:22.010
This is how much came in from
the beginning of the year.

29:22.011 --> 29:25.020
This is how much came in today.

29:25.021 --> 29:26.140
It's staggering.

29:27.231 --> 29:29.080
It's money.

29:29.081 --> 29:30.180
I know it's just money,

29:30.181 --> 29:33.160
but each of these comes
from a person...

29:33.161 --> 29:35.170
an eager new soul ready to believe

29:35.171 --> 29:37.140
because of you.

29:37.141 --> 29:42.020
Now, I know this weakness
you have for alcohol

29:42.021 --> 29:45.030
is the rock that you carry.

29:45.031 --> 29:47.090
We all have them.

29:47.091 --> 29:50.020
But I just want you to know...

29:50.021 --> 29:52.090
that every period of transition...

29:53.091 --> 29:56.100
Every change is difficult,

29:56.101 --> 29:57.170
sometimes even painful,

29:57.171 --> 29:59.070
but you were right.

29:59.071 --> 30:02.100
They saw us as a "sensitive place."

30:02.101 --> 30:04.180
We're legitimate, and
everything you ever hoped for

30:04.181 --> 30:07.160
for The Movement, we're
on the verge of.

30:07.161 --> 30:10.100
We're going to be a powerful
force in the world.

30:11.121 --> 30:13.060
It's all coming true.

30:26.201 --> 30:29.230
I have not been here in so long.

30:29.231 --> 30:32.120
Nobody here.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.241
Yeah.

30:39.031 --> 30:40.120
Freak show?

30:40.121 --> 30:43.060
They don't still have that, do they?

30:43.061 --> 30:45.100
Tattooed lady?

30:45.101 --> 30:48.081
I think it's just some old signs.

30:51.101 --> 30:52.230
What's a funnel cake?

30:54.151 --> 30:57.131
You've never been to any
place like this, have you?

31:03.031 --> 31:04.210
Should we put a rock down?

31:04.211 --> 31:06.110
Uh...

31:06.111 --> 31:10.070
it's not one of the sacred sites.

31:10.071 --> 31:13.230
I mean, but it kind of is...

31:13.231 --> 31:15.121
for you.

31:25.141 --> 31:27.011
You worried?

31:29.061 --> 31:31.030
We're too far off track.

31:31.031 --> 31:33.120
You're worried.

31:33.121 --> 31:35.100
No, it's, um...

31:35.101 --> 31:37.201
it's gonna be fine.

31:44.201 --> 31:47.210
We can just walk faster.

31:47.211 --> 31:49.120
You know? I mean, you said it.

31:49.121 --> 31:50.180
When Doc did this,

31:50.181 --> 31:52.060
he didn't know what was next.

31:52.061 --> 31:55.240
He just knew he couldn't
stay where he was.

31:55.241 --> 31:58.050
Did I say that?

31:58.051 --> 31:59.080
Yeah.

32:05.241 --> 32:07.060
Whoa, Dad.

32:10.021 --> 32:12.120
There's just a lot of memories here.

32:12.121 --> 32:15.080
But, um...

32:15.081 --> 32:16.230
good ones though, right?

32:20.121 --> 32:22.130
With my brother, yeah.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.090
Are you gonna be okay?

32:32.131 --> 32:35.010
Yeah.

32:35.011 --> 32:37.210
Yeah, it's, uh...

32:37.211 --> 32:40.120
it's good.

32:40.121 --> 32:43.070
Come on.

33:00.231 --> 33:03.070
Oh, the Wonder Wheel.

33:03.071 --> 33:05.020
There's this Russian
deli that Johnny used to

33:05.021 --> 33:06.080
steal beer from.

33:06.081 --> 33:08.080
And we'd get the perfect buzz on

33:08.081 --> 33:10.210
and ride that thing all day long,

33:10.211 --> 33:14.060
until we were sick.

33:14.061 --> 33:16.100
That doesn't sound at all smart.

33:16.101 --> 33:18.240
Nah, it wasn't.

33:20.101 --> 33:22.100
Oh, my God.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.120
- This game here?
- Mmhmm?

33:24.121 --> 33:26.090
Johnny figured out if you put

33:26.091 --> 33:29.130
just the perfect spin on the ball...

33:29.131 --> 33:31.110
hit the back rim...

33:31.111 --> 33:33.230
it goes in every time.

33:33.231 --> 33:35.200
Isn't that cheating?

33:35.201 --> 33:37.070
No.

33:37.071 --> 33:38.240
Well...

33:38.241 --> 33:42.020
Yeah, maybe. It's just
gaming the system.

33:42.021 --> 33:44.030
But you'd get the big teddy bears.

33:44.031 --> 33:46.070
The teddy bears would get the girls.

33:46.071 --> 33:49.020
And you'd take the girls
down to the beach, and...

33:49.021 --> 33:52.010
you know, I shouldn't be
telling you any of this.

33:52.011 --> 33:53.130
Ha!

33:53.131 --> 33:55.020
Sorry, had to.

33:55.021 --> 33:57.230
Um...

33:57.231 --> 34:00.030
I'm, uh... I love this stuff.

34:00.031 --> 34:01.090
Like, what...

34:01.091 --> 34:02.210
you never tell me these stories.

34:02.211 --> 34:05.040
You don't ask.

34:05.041 --> 34:06.130
I did when I was a kid.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.231
But it always seemed to bum you out.

34:13.071 --> 34:14.201
Ah.

34:19.031 --> 34:22.199
Oh, no way.

34:22.201 --> 34:25.110
I totally forgot about those.

34:25.110 --> 34:27.130
What are they?

34:27.130 --> 34:29.120
Clam rolls.

34:29.121 --> 34:33.010
Only the greatest thing you
can eat on this planet,

34:33.011 --> 34:34.040
bar none.

34:34.041 --> 34:37.100
Aw, $11!

34:37.101 --> 34:39.040
That's highway robbery.

34:39.041 --> 34:41.040
They were four bucks
when I was a kid...

34:41.041 --> 34:42.080
five with a Coke.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.130
Well, we should get some.

34:44.130 --> 34:46.199
Nah, that's practically
all we have left.

34:46.201 --> 34:48.179
Aw...

34:48.181 --> 34:52.239
I mean, if they're the best
thing you've ever had...

34:52.241 --> 34:55.101
Nah, it's all right.

34:57.071 --> 34:59.180
Hawk...

34:59.181 --> 35:01.030
Hawk!

35:01.031 --> 35:05.020
Two clam rolls, please.

35:05.021 --> 35:07.201
You buying?

35:09.241 --> 35:11.090
He's buying.

35:11.091 --> 35:13.130
Oh, yes.

35:13.131 --> 35:15.091
Yes, I am.

36:07.191 --> 36:08.210
You come back up...

36:08.211 --> 36:10.100
Nico, I'm gonna get you.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.120
Come back upstairs, you're...

36:11.121 --> 36:13.040
she's trying to have a baby!

36:13.041 --> 36:14.200
No running!

36:14.201 --> 36:17.050
Can somebody get them to
stop acting like animals?

36:17.051 --> 36:19.230
I dove on top of Summer just in time...

36:19.231 --> 36:21.060
Oh, how frightening.

36:21.061 --> 36:22.220
But when I look up,

36:22.221 --> 36:24.070
it's not Summer.

36:24.071 --> 36:26.120
It's the Pachamama idol.

36:26.121 --> 36:27.230
Like that one that showed
up in your office?

36:27.231 --> 36:28.240
Exactly.

36:28.241 --> 36:30.110
Okay, major wave coming.

36:30.111 --> 36:33.040
Have you thought about what it means?

36:33.041 --> 36:34.140
I think it's pretty clear. You know?

36:34.141 --> 36:37.040
I've been anxious about Hawk being away

36:37.041 --> 36:38.080
and his safety...

36:38.081 --> 36:39.240
That's too literal.

36:39.241 --> 36:42.020
I mean, you're not just
you in your dreams.

36:42.021 --> 36:43.050
You're everything,

36:43.051 --> 36:45.030
including that Pachamama.

36:45.031 --> 36:46.240
Maybe you're the one

36:46.241 --> 36:48.070
holding yourself back,

36:48.071 --> 36:50.120
afraid to embrace your true power.

36:50.121 --> 36:52.140
Can it not be about Sarah for a second?

36:52.141 --> 36:54.050
I'm trying to have a fucking baby here!

36:54.051 --> 36:56.030
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

36:56.031 --> 36:57.120
- Let's move you...
- Here, here, here.

36:57.121 --> 36:58.230
Into a more comfortable position.

36:58.231 --> 37:00.030
Come on, guys.

37:00.031 --> 37:02.180
No tag in the birth environment.

37:02.181 --> 37:05.230
The baby needs to enter a
peaceful space, not a...

37:05.231 --> 37:07.040
sorry, babe.

37:07.041 --> 37:09.060
What is wrong with this one?

37:09.061 --> 37:11.070
Oh, none of mine have taken this long.

37:11.071 --> 37:12.240
She should be popping out by now.

37:12.241 --> 37:14.230
Every baby has its own journey.

37:16.231 --> 37:18.220
Hey, Cal.

37:18.221 --> 37:21.010
You're already here for the ceremony.

37:21.011 --> 37:23.200
We have no soul to
induct yet, I'm afraid.

37:23.201 --> 37:25.070
Anything I can do?

37:25.071 --> 37:27.150
You can get my kids
to shut the fuck up.

37:27.151 --> 37:29.090
Russel doesn't seem too capable.

37:29.091 --> 37:30.230
- Honey...
- It's okay.

37:30.231 --> 37:33.120
Anger can be a good engine
sometimes, all right?

37:33.121 --> 37:36.020
We need to channel whatever
energy we have right now.

37:37.211 --> 37:39.160
We can call you when the baby comes.

37:39.161 --> 37:40.220
No, I want to stay.

37:40.221 --> 37:41.220
I want to... want to be of help.

37:43.171 --> 37:46.010
Ohhh...

37:46.011 --> 37:49.010
Remember, the pain is
not bigger than you.

37:49.011 --> 37:50.120
It is you.

37:53.211 --> 37:55.030
Let it go.

37:55.031 --> 37:56.050
You're good.

38:01.021 --> 38:03.190
Mmm.

38:03.191 --> 38:05.200
You know...

38:05.201 --> 38:08.210
part of me thought that
these cannot be that good.

38:08.211 --> 38:11.030
You know, it's probably
just the memory.

38:11.031 --> 38:14.100
No, they're awesome.

38:14.101 --> 38:15.240
Right?

38:15.241 --> 38:18.130
Oh.

38:18.131 --> 38:20.020
The greasy, crunchy bit...

38:20.021 --> 38:22.210
I mean, it's so... so terrible,

38:22.211 --> 38:26.130
but it's perfect.

38:26.131 --> 38:28.010
Thank you!

38:47.021 --> 38:49.220
When did you know?

38:49.221 --> 38:53.060
About...

38:53.061 --> 38:55.230
You always hear the Elders

38:55.231 --> 38:58.080
talking about the moment

38:58.081 --> 38:59.180
when they felt it.

38:59.181 --> 39:02.181
Like, the Light just
coming through them.

39:05.171 --> 39:07.190
I'll have to think about that one.

39:07.191 --> 39:10.010
Was it when you took your vows?

39:10.011 --> 39:11.140
Everyone says when it happens,

39:11.141 --> 39:13.010
you just know.

39:13.011 --> 39:16.050
Like, all their questions
are just gone.

39:16.051 --> 39:17.050
There's this clarity.

39:17.051 --> 39:20.040
I mean, no more questions,

39:20.041 --> 39:23.130
no more pain, just...

39:23.131 --> 39:26.230
Joy said...

39:26.231 --> 39:29.200
she could feel her body
lifting off the ground.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.241
Like, she could feel it.

39:34.211 --> 39:38.170
I don't think I've ever had
that feeling, actually.

39:38.171 --> 39:41.091
Well, at least not in The Movement.

39:43.171 --> 39:46.200
Closest thing to it

39:46.201 --> 39:49.190
was probably when

39:49.191 --> 39:51.011
I met your mom.

39:55.181 --> 39:57.230
You know, she can just

39:57.231 --> 40:00.020
lift all my doubts

40:00.021 --> 40:04.010
and pain

40:04.011 --> 40:05.181
just by looking at me.

40:08.161 --> 40:09.241
Hm.

40:22.011 --> 40:24.020
Hey, hey, don't.

40:24.021 --> 40:27.130
Don't do that.

40:27.131 --> 40:29.200
I love her.

40:29.201 --> 40:31.170
I know you just think
it's a Transgress,

40:31.171 --> 40:34.150
but I love Ashley.

40:34.151 --> 40:36.050
She makes me feel like that...

40:36.051 --> 40:38.180
like it might all be okay.

40:38.181 --> 40:40.130
And when she's not here, I just feel

40:40.131 --> 40:43.050
so empty and awful, and...

40:43.051 --> 40:47.150
I mean, how can one person
do all of that for you?

40:49.171 --> 40:51.150
Now I can't even talk to her.

40:51.151 --> 40:53.170
It's just not fair.

40:53.171 --> 40:56.110
It's not.

41:04.111 --> 41:07.150
Come on.

41:07.151 --> 41:11.020
What?

41:11.021 --> 41:14.110
Come on.

41:22.121 --> 41:25.060
I didn't even know there
still were pay phones.

41:25.061 --> 41:26.220
I had a feeling about this one.

41:26.221 --> 41:29.180
I just knew it would still be here.

41:29.181 --> 41:32.120
How do we even know it works?

41:32.121 --> 41:34.050
You have to try.

41:40.021 --> 41:43.060
What if she doesn't want me back?

41:43.061 --> 41:46.180
Then you will know.

41:46.181 --> 41:47.240
I mean, what if she does?

41:47.241 --> 41:50.170
I don't want to have to leave.

41:50.171 --> 41:52.120
Well, you have to know either way.

41:52.121 --> 41:56.110
You know, you can't stay
with your eyes closed.

41:56.111 --> 41:58.070
Come on.

42:15.131 --> 42:18.030
Hey, Ashley.

42:18.031 --> 42:20.010
It's me.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.180
Hey.

43:22.041 --> 43:23.200
I miss you too.

43:26.131 --> 43:27.220
I can't.

43:27.221 --> 43:29.230
We're so close, sweetheart.

43:29.231 --> 43:31.210
One more push, and the
baby's gonna be here.

43:33.051 --> 43:34.050
It's not good.

43:34.051 --> 43:35.150
No, it's not.

43:35.151 --> 43:36.150
Something's bad.

43:36.151 --> 43:37.200
What's she saying?

43:37.201 --> 43:39.030
All right, just bear down here.

43:39.031 --> 43:40.050
- Here it comes.
- Here comes the head.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.050
- Yup.
- That's it!

43:41.051 --> 43:42.120
Beautiful.

43:42.121 --> 43:43.220
Come on.

43:43.221 --> 43:45.030
Yes, here we go!

43:46.031 --> 43:49.220
Oh!

43:52.021 --> 43:53.020
- What?
- You're okay.

43:53.021 --> 43:55.081
Why isn't she crying?

43:57.021 --> 43:58.170
No, I've got it. I've got it.

43:58.171 --> 43:59.200
I've got it. I've got it. What's wrong?

43:59.201 --> 44:00.200
Here we go. Here we go.

44:00.201 --> 44:03.150
Here we go.

44:03.151 --> 44:05.020
Is something
wrong with my baby?

44:05.021 --> 44:06.120
Oh, my God.

44:08.241 --> 44:10.210
What's wrong with my baby?
Something's wrong!

44:10.211 --> 44:13.010
Oh, my God, something's wrong with her!

44:13.011 --> 44:14.230
Oh, my God!

44:14.231 --> 44:16.200
Oh, my God.

44:16.201 --> 44:19.200
Oh, my God, something's wrong with her.

44:19.201 --> 44:21.020
Oh, my God.

44:33.061 --> 44:35.040
Oh...

44:44.201 --> 44:45.210
It's too sweet.

44:45.211 --> 44:47.200
Yes.

44:55.201 --> 44:58.240
Welcome, little one,

44:58.241 --> 45:00.180
to our world.

45:00.181 --> 45:02.160
You are whole,

45:02.161 --> 45:05.110
and you are broken,

45:05.111 --> 45:07.230
just like the rest of us.

45:07.231 --> 45:09.230
We give thanks

45:09.231 --> 45:11.220
for your wholeness.

45:11.221 --> 45:14.150
And we work to heal your brokenness,

45:14.151 --> 45:16.210
- so that one day...
- Oh, yeah.

45:16.211 --> 45:19.110
We will be all that you need us to be.

45:21.171 --> 45:23.190
Yeah.

45:23.191 --> 45:24.240
Thank you.

45:27.231 --> 45:29.200
Okay.

45:29.201 --> 45:31.181
Oh, my God.

45:44.741 --> 45:46.610
Is this right?

45:49.801 --> 45:51.810
There, that's good, yeah.

45:51.811 --> 45:55.800
So may the energy flow through us

45:55.801 --> 45:57.720
and connect us.

45:57.721 --> 46:00.640
May our energy be more
powerful than the past.

46:02.811 --> 46:05.620
Right?

46:05.621 --> 46:08.750
Yeah, that's it.

46:08.751 --> 46:10.760
Do you understand my intention?

46:14.621 --> 46:16.730
Yes.

46:19.651 --> 46:23.620
Are you present for my questions?

46:23.621 --> 46:24.720
I am.

46:24.721 --> 46:27.730
Was there anything between you and Cal?

46:27.731 --> 46:29.640
No.

46:32.731 --> 46:34.730
I think I was confused...

46:36.761 --> 46:38.650
When I first got here.

46:38.651 --> 46:40.610
But that was then.

46:40.611 --> 46:43.620
Now I'm here with you...

46:43.621 --> 46:45.780
all of me.

46:45.781 --> 46:48.750
I'm so happy you're back.

47:00.721 --> 47:03.780
Just one... one second, okay?

47:03.781 --> 47:05.770
Okay.

47:53.731 --> 47:55.721
What you did in there was...

47:57.621 --> 47:59.810
What anyone would have done...

47:59.811 --> 48:01.611
what you would have done.

48:04.781 --> 48:06.730
Magnificent.

48:15.651 --> 48:19.640
You are magnificent.

48:47.611 --> 48:48.740
No, we can't.

48:48.741 --> 48:49.840
It's okay. It's okay.

48:51.811 --> 48:53.680
No.

48:53.681 --> 48:54.770
It's not.

48:54.771 --> 48:56.790
I know things have been
hard with Eddie...

49:00.771 --> 49:02.720
No.

49:02.721 --> 49:04.660
Stop.

49:04.661 --> 49:06.620
Okay.

49:11.641 --> 49:12.790
What is it?

49:12.791 --> 49:14.750
What's going on?

49:14.751 --> 49:15.750
Cal?

49:17.661 --> 49:18.740
There's something that
I haven't told you.

49:18.741 --> 49:20.620
And, um...

49:22.651 --> 49:24.760
Um...

49:24.761 --> 49:26.720
it's been killing me.

49:30.641 --> 49:32.670
I don't think I can keep
it from you any longer.

49:32.671 --> 49:33.770
Um...

49:35.631 --> 49:38.770
You can tell me anything.

49:46.771 --> 49:48.720
He's lying to you.

49:50.771 --> 49:52.760
Eddie's lying to you.

49:55.761 --> 49:59.690
Is that...

49:59.691 --> 50:01.700
why you sent him on The Walk, isn't it?

50:01.701 --> 50:03.710
Yeah.

50:06.711 --> 50:08.740
It's why you sent him on The Walk.
