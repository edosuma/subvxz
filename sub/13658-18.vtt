20:12.745 --> 20:15.646
WE'RE DRAWING UP THAT DOCUMENT
AS I SPEAK.

20:15.648 --> 20:19.116
ALSO, AS REQUESTED,
WE HAVE BROUGHT YOU RUSTY BECK

20:19.118 --> 20:21.886
SO YOU CAN QUESTION HIM,
AFTER WHICH,

20:21.888 --> 20:26.123
PER YOUR PROPOSAL, YOU WILL
GIVE US THE NAME OF THIS KILLER.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.894
THOSE SOUND LIKE MOVES
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, RIOS,

20:29.896 --> 20:32.863
BUT MY CONDITIONS
MUST BE MET FULLY, IN WRITING,

20:32.865 --> 20:35.900
BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN
"TIME IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE,"

20:35.902 --> 20:37.668
AND THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO QUESTION THE BOY

20:37.670 --> 20:39.170
WITHOUT A CROWD
AROUND ME.

20:39.172 --> 20:41.706
YOU CAN'T THINK I'M LEAVING YOU
ALONE WITH RUSTY.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.375
UNLESS YOU WANT
MORE WOMEN TO DIE,

20:44.377 --> 20:47.178
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.247
YOU HAVE AN OFFER
FOR FULL IMMUNITY.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.748
IF YOU REFUSE IT

20:50.750 --> 20:52.683
AND WE FIND OUT THAT
YOU'RE BEHIND THESE MURDERS...

20:52.685 --> 20:56.587
YOU'RE WHO'S BEHIND,
CAPTAIN, NOT ME.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.689
AND I'M NOT THE ONE
PULLING THE STRINGS HERE.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.591
IT'S D.D.A. RIOS
WHO'S IN CHARGE

21:00.593 --> 21:03.761
AND D.D.A. RIOS
WHO'S DELAYING THE PROCESS.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.697
WHEN I HAVE MY DEAL
IN WRITING --

21:06.699 --> 21:08.866
Schaeffer: PHILLIP, IF YOU SHOW
THE POLICE SOME GOODWILL,

21:08.868 --> 21:10.534
THEY MIGHT SHOW YOU SOME
IN RETURN.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.403
DO I STRIKE YOU
AS THE KIND OF PERSON

21:12.405 --> 21:13.871
WHO BELIEVES IN GOODWILL?

21:17.509 --> 21:20.378
NO.
I BELIEVE IN CONTRACTS.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.912
GIVE ME WHAT I WANT,
IN WRITING.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.783
IN RETURN, YOU WILL RECEIVE
A CHANCE TO ARREST A MURDERER --

21:25.785 --> 21:28.753
AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WON'T
COME AROUND AGAIN FOR A WHILE.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.422
"WON'T COME AROUND AGAIN
FOR A WHILE" --

21:31.424 --> 21:33.024
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

21:33.026 --> 21:35.359
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR VICTIM?

21:35.361 --> 21:38.062
THE QUESTION IS,
"HOW COULD YOU NOT?"

21:39.364 --> 21:40.665
UH-OH.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.067
PERHAPS I'VE SAID
TOO MUCH.

21:43.069 --> 21:47.071
THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO THINK ABOUT, ANYWAY.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.873
ARE WE, UH,
WE DONE HERE?

21:48.875 --> 21:51.575
WORKING OUT
HOW YOU QUESTION RUSTY ALONE

21:51.577 --> 21:53.210
IS GONNA TAKE SOME TIME.

21:53.212 --> 21:55.346
YOUR PROBLEM, CAPTAIN.
NOT MINE.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.747
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

21:56.749 --> 21:58.716
I HAVE SOME THINGS
I NEED TO DISCUSS WITH STEPHEN,

21:58.718 --> 22:00.418
IN CASE
THE D.A's OFFICE DECIDES

22:00.420 --> 22:02.219
TO PULL THEIR ACT TOGETHER
IN TIME.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.321
Rusty:
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.022
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TALK TO ME NOW?

22:05.824 --> 22:08.559
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY,
RUSTY.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.928
MAYBE WE'LL SOLVE THIS MURDER
WITHOUT YOU.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.398
AND MAYBE YOU WON'T.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.341
HOW DOES IT FEEL, EMMA,

22:23.343 --> 22:25.009
KNOWING SOMEBODY DIED
BECAUSE OF YOUR INACTION,

22:25.011 --> 22:27.545
AND THAT ANOTHER WOMAN
COULD BE MURDERED

22:27.547 --> 22:28.979
BECAUSE YOU DRAGGED
YOUR FEET?

22:28.981 --> 22:31.749
MR. STROH...

22:31.751 --> 22:33.984
IF YOU TURN DOWN
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY

22:33.986 --> 22:37.088
TO INTERVIEW THE WITNESS
AND TWO MORE WOMEN DIE,

22:37.090 --> 22:38.589
THESE LITTLE TRIPS YOU MAKE

22:38.591 --> 22:41.092
TO CHAT WITH
YOUR OLD FRIEND HERE WILL END,

22:41.094 --> 22:43.861
AND THERE WILL BE NO DEAL.

22:48.633 --> 22:52.236
SET THE BOY UP IN AN
INTERVIEW ROOM AT MAJOR CRIMES.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.938
CHAIN ME TO THE FLOOR.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.707
YOU CAN RUN VIDEO.
OBSERVE ME.

22:56.709 --> 23:00.277
I'LL SWING BY TOMORROW
AND GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.

23:01.079 --> 23:04.849
AND NOW YOU CAN
GET OUT OF MY WAY...

23:04.851 --> 23:07.518
PLEASE.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.826
[ DOOR CLOSES ]
WHAT KIND OF GAME
ARE YOU PLAYING, PHILLIP?

23:15.828 --> 23:18.729
THEY'RE THE ONES PLAYING GAMES,
STEPHEN, NOT ME.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.999
IF THEY'VE AGREED TO MY TERMS,
WHY NOT PUT IT IN WRITING?

23:22.001 --> 23:24.568
YOU DON'T WANT
ANOTHER WOMAN TO DIE, DO YOU?

23:26.104 --> 23:29.073
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY THINK
THAT I CARE ABOUT THE GIRL.

23:33.912 --> 23:37.481
GRAB ME A FILE OUT OF THAT BOX
MARKED "PPE."

23:37.483 --> 23:39.049
I'LL BEGIN
DECODING SOME FILES

23:39.051 --> 23:41.252
THAT MIGHT HELP US EXPEDITE
THE PROCESS

23:41.254 --> 23:44.822
IN CASE THE D.A.'s OFFICE
DECIDES TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.259
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.594
WHEN WE WERE IN LAW SCHOOL
TOGETHER, I ADMIRED YOU.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.664
OH, STEPHEN,
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME COMPLETELY.

23:53.666 --> 23:57.268
BESIDES,
I GAVE THEM A CLUE...

23:58.069 --> 24:01.539
...IF THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH
TO FOLLOW IT.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.773
Tao:
IF THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

24:02.775 --> 24:04.241
THAT WON'T COME AROUND AGAIN
FOR A WHILE,

24:04.243 --> 24:05.543
THEN WE HAVE TO ASSUME

24:05.545 --> 24:07.144
THAT WE'VE HAD
THIS OPPORTUNITY BEFORE.

24:07.146 --> 24:10.014
AND THAT THESE MURDERS
ARE PART OF A PATTERN.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.216
WELL, IT COULD EXPLAIN
HOW HE KNEW

24:12.218 --> 24:14.084
WHERE OR WHEN THE NEXT VICTIM
WOULD BE FOUND.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.620
UP TO A POINT.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.989
I PULLED EVERY DEATH
IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

24:18.991 --> 24:21.192
INVOLVING BOTH PROSTITUTES
AND ARSON,

24:21.194 --> 24:24.695
AND SO FAR,
I'VE FOUND SEVEN OTHER VICTIMS

24:24.697 --> 24:26.363
THAT KIND OF MATCH.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.699
TWO OF THEM,

24:28.701 --> 24:33.404
THESE BLUE STICKERS HERE,
WERE IN FEBRUARY 2013.

24:33.406 --> 24:35.706
THEY DIED WITHIN A WEEK
OF EACH OTHER.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.676
THEN THESE THREE GREEN STICKERS
HERE ARE VICTIMS

24:38.678 --> 24:44.148
FOUND IN FEBRUARY 2011 --
AGAIN WITHIN AROUND EIGHT DAYS.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.484
BUT WE'RE IN JANUARY.

24:47.752 --> 24:51.388
AND IN MARCH OF 2009,
ANOTHER VICTIM,

24:51.390 --> 24:53.190
AND ANOTHER VICTIM
IN MARCH 2007,

24:53.192 --> 24:56.126
THOUGH SHE WAS BURNED UP
IN AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE,

24:56.128 --> 24:57.361
NOT A VACANT RESIDENCE.

24:57.363 --> 25:00.598
NOW, THESE ARE ALMOST TWO YEARS
APART, BUT NOT QUITE.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.733
BUT IF THE TIMING
ISN'T EXACT

25:02.735 --> 25:05.736
AND THE CAUSE OF DEATH
ON SOME OF OUR VICTIMS

25:05.738 --> 25:07.204
IS LISTED AS ACCIDENTAL,

25:07.206 --> 25:10.574
HOW DOES STROH SEE A PATTERN
HERE AND WE DON'T?

25:10.576 --> 25:12.510
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING ELSE.

25:12.512 --> 25:13.944
ALL OF THEM
WERE STREETWALKERS,

25:13.946 --> 25:16.146
THOUGH IT TOOK MONTHS
TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THEM.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.082
THEY WERE ALL BURNT
TO A CRISP.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.984
Oh, God.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.523
THIS MARCH 2009 VICTIM
WAS LAST SEEN ON SLAUSON?

25:25.525 --> 25:27.224
UH, YES, MA'AM.

25:27.226 --> 25:32.096
AND SHE ENDED UP -- BUZZ --
IN THE CRENSHAW NEIGHBORHOOD,

25:32.098 --> 25:33.497
LESS THAN A MILE AWAY.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.832
AND THE SAME
WITH THIS VICTIM OVER HERE.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.134
SHE WAS FOUND
NEAR MANCHESTER AND THE 1,

25:37.136 --> 25:40.504
BUT LAST SEEN GETTING INTO A CAR
NEAR JEFFERSON BOULEVARD.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.540
LESS THAN
A HALF A MILE AWAY.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.475
AND OUR MOST RECENT VICTIM
WAS FOUND

25:44.477 --> 25:45.809
ON HOBART,

25:45.811 --> 25:49.213
WHICH IS VERY CLOSE
TO HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD'S

25:49.215 --> 25:51.382
LESS-GLAMOROUS MOTELS.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.050
IF HE PICKS UP THE GIRL

25:53.052 --> 25:56.754
NEAR WHERE HE INTENDS
TO DUMP THE BODY AND BURN IT...

25:56.756 --> 25:59.890
THEN WE KNOW WHERE
OUR LAST VICTIM WENT MISSING.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.860
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
I THINK WE MAY HAVE FOUND

26:02.862 --> 26:04.995
SOMETHING USEFUL FOR YOU.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.687
YOU LOOKING FOR A DATE?

26:29.689 --> 26:30.754
I SURE AM.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.656
WHY DON'T YOU HOP IN?

26:32.658 --> 26:35.359
WE'LL GO SOMEPLACE
A LITTLE LESS BUSY.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.194
I GOT A ROOM
WE COULD GO TO.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.696
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO GET IN THE CARS.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.230
AW, WELL,
I CAN PUT ON THE HEAT.

26:40.232 --> 26:43.500
I'LL PAY YOU EXTRA, YO.
YOU LIKE EXTRA, DON'T YOU?

26:43.502 --> 26:45.235
NOW WE'RE TALKING.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.445
YOU A COP?!
MAN, I KNEW YOU WAS A COP.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.547
LOOK, I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING
ABOUT WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO

26:56.549 --> 26:58.115
IN THAT ROOM, BRO.
I DON'T WANT TO BUST YOU.
I'M NOT HERE TO BUST YOU.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.850
I'M WORKING ON A CASE.
HEY, THIS IS ENTRAPMENT!

26:59.852 --> 27:01.652
DON'T YOU GOT SOMETHING
BETTER TO DO?
HEY, HEY!

27:01.654 --> 27:03.921
LOOK. I'M TRYING
TO FIND A MISSING GIRL.

27:03.923 --> 27:07.257
IS THERE ANYONE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS,

27:07.259 --> 27:10.527
SOMEONE WHO WORE A DRESS
WITH THIS PATTERN ON IT

27:10.529 --> 27:11.862
OR WORE THIS BRACELET?

27:11.864 --> 27:13.731
NO. CAN I GO NOW?

27:13.733 --> 27:14.932
WHAT? YOU KNOW
I'M GONNA GET IN TROUBLE

27:14.934 --> 27:16.467
FOR TALKING TO THE COPS.
I KNOW.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.669
BUT I'M TRYING TO FIND THE GIRL
WHO WORE THIS DRESS.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.971
YOU HELP ME,
YOU GET TO KEEP THAT.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.140
THAT'S GOT MY NAME
AND MY NUMBER ON IT.

27:23.142 --> 27:26.143
AND THE NEXT TIME YOU
GET PICKED UP FOR SOLICITATION,

27:26.145 --> 27:28.112
THAT BECOMES YOUR
"GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" CARD.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.447
COME ON, YO, THAT'S AT LEAST
WORTH THE GIRL'S NAME, RIGHT?

27:30.449 --> 27:32.883
DENISHA!
GET YOUR ASS OUT OF THE CAR.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.652
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO GET IN ANY CARS!
Denisha: NO, I DIDN'T KNOW!
I DIDN'T KNOW!

27:34.654 --> 27:36.186
GET OUT OF THE CAR!
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW!

27:36.188 --> 27:37.821
AAH!

27:37.823 --> 27:39.757
GET DOWN!
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU,
BITCH?!

27:39.759 --> 27:41.291
PULL UP, COOPER.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.727
LAWYER. LAWYER. LAWYER.

27:43.729 --> 27:44.895
GOOD JOB, SYKES. GOOD JOB.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.130
LAWYER.
I'LL HANDLE THIS DIRTBAG.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.731
LAWYER. LAWYER.
HEY, LISTEN TO ME!

27:47.733 --> 27:49.099
LAWYER.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.035
I JUST ASKED FOR A LAWYER!
YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT,

27:51.037 --> 27:53.404
I JUST ASKED FOR A LAWYER!
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL
BE USED AGAINST YOU

27:53.406 --> 27:55.139
IN A COURT OF LAW...
WHATEVER! LAWYER! LAWYER!

27:55.141 --> 27:58.175
ALL RIGHT, WHY DIDN'T HE
WANT YOU TO GET IN THE CAR?

27:58.177 --> 28:00.010
ANOTHER ONE OF HIS GIRLS,
CAT, LEFT WITH A JOHN

28:00.012 --> 28:01.845
AND DIDN'T COME BACK,
SO FRE$H SAID NO MORE CARS.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.113
WHEN WAS THIS,
A COUPLE DAYS AGO?

28:03.115 --> 28:04.581
NO. IT WAS
A COUPLE OF <i>HOURS</i> AGO.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.050
I DON'T KNOW,
SOME CREEPO PICKED HER UP,

28:06.052 --> 28:07.618
AND I DIDN'T LIKE HIM,
SO HE WENT TO CAT.

28:07.620 --> 28:09.720
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?
W-W-WHAT KIND OF CAR
WAS HE DRIVING?

28:09.722 --> 28:11.188
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE!

28:11.190 --> 28:12.256
I TURNED AWAY.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.757
AND -- AND I DON'T KNOW CARS.
IT WAS OLDER.

28:13.759 --> 28:16.126
MY GOD. HE'S ALREADY GOT
HIS SECOND VICTIM.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.495
YES, AND OUR PIMP
IS ALREADY SCREAMING,

28:18.497 --> 28:20.698
"LAWYER," SEVERAL TIMES.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.332
DAMN IT.

28:22.334 --> 28:26.937
HOW MANY DEALS ARE WE GONNA HAVE
TO MAKE BEFORE THIS IS DONE?

28:30.909 --> 28:33.310
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
MY NAME IS FRE$H,

28:33.312 --> 28:35.312
AND THAT'S A DOLLAR SIGN INSTEAD
OF AN "S", BRO, ALL RIGHT?

28:35.314 --> 28:36.647
OKAY, YOU GOT IT, BRO.

28:36.649 --> 28:38.649
NOW THAT
INTRODUCTIONS ARE OVER,

28:38.651 --> 28:39.850
CAN YOU START
TELLING ME WHY

28:39.852 --> 28:41.485
YOU THINK
YOU CAN HOLD MY CLIENT?

28:41.487 --> 28:44.421
WE HAVE TWO MISSING WOMEN WHO
ARE POSSIBLY CONNECTED TO FRE$H.

28:44.423 --> 28:47.057
MAN, COME ON, MAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THESE GIRLS GO, MAN.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.426
YOU WOULDN'T BE OFFERING
MY CLIENT TWO YEARS

28:49.428 --> 28:51.528
IF YOU THOUGHT HE WAS A SUSPECT
IN KIDNAPPINGS.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.397
WELL, WE WOULDN'T BE
OFFERING HIM THE TIME OF DAY,

28:53.399 --> 28:56.033
EXCEPT WE COULD USE HIS HELP
IN I.D.'ing HIS GIRLS.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.168
AND LET'S REMEMBER, MIRIAM,
THAT PIMPING IS COUNTED

28:58.170 --> 29:00.137
AS SEX TRAFFICKING NOW
IN FEDERAL COURT,

29:00.139 --> 29:02.573
WHICH IS WHERE I'M GOING TO
SEND HIM IF HE DOESN'T HELP --

29:02.575 --> 29:03.974
NOW.
OKAY.

29:03.976 --> 29:08.045
OKAY, LOOK, THEY'RE OFFERING YOU
A GENEROUS DEAL.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.013
TWO YEARS?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

29:10.015 --> 29:12.950
AT THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE,
YOU'LL GET 10, <i>BRO.</i>

29:12.952 --> 29:15.185
GOD, MAN, COME ON,
ALL THIS HARD WORK,

29:15.187 --> 29:17.221
AND IT'S GONE
LIKE IT WERE NOTHING, RIGHT?

29:17.223 --> 29:19.323
THAT'S HOW YOU TREAT PEOPLE
YOU NEED?
Sharon: YES, IT IS.

29:19.325 --> 29:22.159
AND IF YOU DON'T TELL US
WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT CAT,

29:22.161 --> 29:24.461
WE'LL SEE YOU IN A DECADE.
TELL YOU ABOUT CAT?

29:24.463 --> 29:26.063
ABOUT CAT.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU?

29:26.065 --> 29:28.232
I DON'T MAKE THESE GIRLS
FILL OUT I-9s, ALL RIGHT?

29:28.234 --> 29:30.501
AND IF SHE'S MISSING,
IT'S HER OWN DAMN FAULT.

29:30.503 --> 29:31.835
ALL RIGHT?

29:31.837 --> 29:33.604
I TOLD MY BITCHES
