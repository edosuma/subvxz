01:47.505 --> 01:48.407
Get 'em!

02:37.523 --> 02:39.692
- Hills.
- Yeah.

02:40.826 --> 02:42.127
Trees.

02:42.594 --> 02:43.796
Oh, yeah.

02:44.530 --> 02:45.665
A river!

02:46.665 --> 02:47.733
Hm?

02:48.768 --> 02:50.636
You know? I think
your vision's getting better.

02:51.102 --> 02:53.038
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.970
Then can I drive
for a bit?

02:54.972 --> 02:57.642
Yeah. Nice try.

03:00.779 --> 03:01.913
So we're almost there.

03:05.883 --> 03:07.720
You want to swing
by the school and...

03:08.053 --> 03:09.655
get your bearings for tomorrow?

03:10.054 --> 03:12.157
No, I'll just get
my bearings in the morning.

03:13.492 --> 03:14.727
- Imogen, I...
- Mom!

03:15.226 --> 03:16.760
Sorry.

03:16.762 --> 03:17.764
Grace.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.149
Uh...

04:23.562 --> 04:25.198
- Hey, hey!
- Hey.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.200
- Made it.
- Yeah.

04:28.666 --> 04:30.202
I'm a bit
behind schedule, sorry.

04:30.736 --> 04:31.937
Oh.

04:32.303 --> 04:33.702
Okay.

04:33.704 --> 04:35.070
- Hello.
- Hey!

04:35.072 --> 04:36.806
- How are you stranger?
- I'm good, Dad.

04:36.808 --> 04:38.110
- How are you?
- Good.

04:42.981 --> 04:44.613
- I'll get it.
- Yeah?

04:44.615 --> 04:45.685
Yeah.

04:59.731 --> 05:00.966
So...

05:02.868 --> 05:05.036
what have you been doing
for the last two days?

05:06.837 --> 05:07.806
Uh...

05:15.147 --> 05:16.949
- Here we are.
- Oh.

05:18.983 --> 05:19.885
Step.

05:22.954 --> 05:23.889
Oh.

05:24.623 --> 05:25.858
- Good?
- Wow.

05:29.194 --> 05:30.096
Huh.

05:31.596 --> 05:32.664
It looks great.

05:33.065 --> 05:33.966
Yeah.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.904
Let's get started
on the rest of the house.

05:38.303 --> 05:39.204
Yes.

05:40.038 --> 05:40.940
Okay.

05:47.613 --> 05:48.844
- What do you think?
- It's amazing, Dad.

05:48.846 --> 05:50.015
It's a really good, yeah.

05:53.151 --> 05:54.220
Watch that step.

07:03.688 --> 07:05.390
I met a guy
while I was walking.

07:05.957 --> 07:07.856
Danny Chapman, he was fishing.

07:07.858 --> 07:09.661
He's the local chief of police.

07:10.195 --> 07:12.764
And he said that the last owner
was the artist.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.698
Oh, so those are his sculptures.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.899
- Mm-hm.
- I like them.

07:15.901 --> 07:17.166
Hm-hm.

07:18.704 --> 07:19.639
Hear that?

07:20.272 --> 07:22.041
Raccoon. I think.

07:22.740 --> 07:25.075
- Mating?
- Uh, maybe.

07:26.377 --> 07:28.413
It's not a ghost.
There is no ghosts.

07:28.947 --> 07:31.414
- I wouldn't care if there were.
- See? That's the spirit.

07:31.416 --> 07:34.084
That's the spirit, man.
You get it?

07:34.086 --> 07:35.452
Yeah. Okay.

07:35.454 --> 07:36.820
Spirit, we got it.

07:36.822 --> 07:38.290
- Thank you!
- Mm-hm.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.610
<i>I don't know
which one to look at.</i>

09:40.612 --> 09:42.113
- <i>I don't either.</i>
- <i>C'mon.</i>

09:50.088 --> 09:51.223
You said you'd stop.

09:51.589 --> 09:53.858
I know, I know. But...

09:54.425 --> 09:57.530
I mean, it's over, right?
We're starting a new life.

09:58.930 --> 10:00.099
What if she came down?

10:07.037 --> 10:07.972
Shit!

10:10.342 --> 10:13.112
Christ! I've got you!

10:13.645 --> 10:15.345
Jesus! What are you doing?

10:15.347 --> 10:17.914
What the hell were you doing?

10:17.916 --> 10:19.318
I was trying to open it.

10:20.017 --> 10:23.154
- Why?
- To see where those angels go.

10:26.156 --> 10:27.459
Sorry.

10:28.526 --> 10:29.495
It's okay.

10:30.362 --> 10:31.296
It's all right.

11:03.460 --> 11:04.596
Oh, God!

11:05.430 --> 11:06.965
Shit!

11:07.431 --> 11:09.198
- Where's the remote?
- Where did you put it?

11:09.200 --> 11:10.469
I don't know. What...?

11:11.268 --> 11:13.404
Hey, guys?

11:14.406 --> 11:15.972
What's all the noise?

11:15.974 --> 11:18.241
It's just
the TV's going crazy.

11:18.243 --> 11:19.911
It's nothing to worry about.

11:21.313 --> 11:22.214
Okay.

11:24.715 --> 11:26.050
Oh, my God.

11:28.353 --> 11:29.387
Where's the remote?

11:40.665 --> 11:42.166
Are you meeting someone?

11:42.367 --> 11:44.567
Yeah, some kid
from the student council,

11:44.569 --> 11:46.204
said to meet him on the grass.

11:48.006 --> 11:50.276
- I'll wait with you.
- I'm okay.

11:52.609 --> 11:53.579
I love you.

12:02.252 --> 12:04.522
Hey, Jason! Jason!

12:56.641 --> 12:58.207
Hey, my man!

12:58.209 --> 12:59.344
Sup, dude?

13:00.778 --> 13:02.278
Good, man. Good.

13:07.185 --> 13:08.454
Hey, are you new here?

13:10.722 --> 13:11.724
Yeah.

13:13.491 --> 13:14.360
Need help?

13:15.560 --> 13:17.429
I'm actually waiting
for someone.

13:18.396 --> 13:19.365
I'm someone.

13:20.065 --> 13:21.032
Brandon.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.202
Grace.

13:24.234 --> 13:25.403
Why'd you move out here?

13:26.137 --> 13:28.107
My mom bought a drugstore.

13:28.573 --> 13:30.576
Cool. I like drugs.

13:31.475 --> 13:32.443
I don't.

13:33.310 --> 13:34.379
I was kidding!

13:34.612 --> 13:35.714
Sure.

13:37.648 --> 13:39.283
So, what are you into?

13:42.320 --> 13:43.321
I don't know.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.193
Well, it was nice
talking to you.

13:48.693 --> 13:50.193
Sorry, I'm just...

13:50.195 --> 13:51.296
Too cool for me.

13:51.563 --> 13:52.861
No, that's...

13:52.863 --> 13:54.532
Just remember,
it pays to be nice.

13:58.636 --> 13:59.738
Imogen.

14:02.574 --> 14:03.474
Grace!

14:04.843 --> 14:06.111
Sorry.

14:06.777 --> 14:08.813
Your book.
Grace. Sorry.

14:38.376 --> 14:39.244
Oh.

15:15.345 --> 15:16.248
Grace.

15:18.215 --> 15:19.417
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

15:19.883 --> 15:21.486
- I'm Eugene.
- Hi!

15:27.525 --> 15:29.328
I'll take you
to your locker first.

15:32.597 --> 15:33.962
Do you need to grab my arm?

15:33.964 --> 15:35.868
Oh, no.
I just go slower on stairs.

15:36.367 --> 15:37.502
All right.

15:44.342 --> 15:45.674
So you're not scared?

15:45.676 --> 15:47.712
No. It's beautiful.

15:48.378 --> 15:49.912
You know,
if you overlook the quirks

15:49.914 --> 15:51.450
and the lousy internet.

15:52.282 --> 15:53.685
I always wanted to look inside.

15:53.884 --> 15:56.586
I mean, not to be morbid
or anything. Just to...

15:56.588 --> 15:57.890
I don't know, pay my respects.

15:58.323 --> 16:00.225
Well, come on over
for dinner sometime.

16:00.425 --> 16:01.827
Did you know the family at all?

16:02.227 --> 16:04.994
Joanne came in here
before her MS got too bad.

16:04.996 --> 16:07.166
That's when he started
coming in for her meds.

16:07.799 --> 16:08.867
What was he like?

16:09.334 --> 16:10.401
He seemed nice.

16:10.667 --> 16:11.967
He didn't talk much.

16:11.969 --> 16:13.738
You'd never guess
he was capable of...

16:13.938 --> 16:14.940
well, you know.

16:15.772 --> 16:17.209
So, Will's an artist, too?

16:17.608 --> 16:19.844
- Yeah. Mm-hm.
- So cool.

16:51.975 --> 16:53.277
Hey, Imogen.

16:54.278 --> 16:55.711
That's not my name.

16:55.713 --> 16:57.416
So why'd you answer to it?

16:57.781 --> 16:58.916
I didn't.

17:00.852 --> 17:03.387
So your mom
just got confused?

17:05.390 --> 17:07.323
- Must be all the drugs.
- Fuck off!

17:07.325 --> 17:08.392
Leave her alone, man.

17:09.594 --> 17:10.595
She's weird.

17:47.364 --> 17:49.034
Raccoons.

18:57.668 --> 18:58.603
Fuck!

19:00.837 --> 19:01.972
You little bastard.

19:46.616 --> 19:47.786
Why so hostile?

19:48.052 --> 19:49.121
I want to be friends.

19:49.853 --> 19:51.655
Can you just leave me alone?

19:52.590 --> 19:53.892
See? You're doing it again.

19:56.561 --> 19:57.462
Imogen?

20:00.030 --> 20:01.630
Oh, Imogen, Imogen...

20:01.632 --> 20:02.734
My name's Grace.

20:03.834 --> 20:04.870
I changed it.

20:06.603 --> 20:07.506
Why?

20:08.139 --> 20:09.141
I never liked it.

20:10.842 --> 20:11.974
What's the real reason?

20:16.546 --> 20:18.112
Sorry I'm late.

20:18.114 --> 20:19.814
- I had to get a new...
- It's okay, just go.

20:19.816 --> 20:20.786
Okay.

20:30.026 --> 20:31.430
It's the only bar.

20:41.238 --> 20:43.906
- Interesting.
- He's a good guy.

20:43.908 --> 20:45.677
- Hello, Cath.
- Tony!

20:46.177 --> 20:47.846
- Hello.
- Sam.

20:48.179 --> 20:50.545
- A pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

20:50.547 --> 20:52.046
Sam just bought
the drugstore.

20:52.048 --> 20:53.882
Thought you'd want to offer her
a welcome drink.

20:53.884 --> 20:55.751
We can do
one better than that.

20:55.753 --> 20:58.457
How about a welcome dinner,
and we'll see where it takes us?

20:58.722 --> 20:59.688
My place or yours?

20:59.690 --> 21:01.125
I'm married.

21:01.625 --> 21:02.957
I guess it'll be my place.

21:02.959 --> 21:04.560
She moved
into the old farmhouse

21:04.562 --> 21:05.828
on O'Hare.

21:05.830 --> 21:08.197
Oh...
definitely my place.

21:09.767 --> 21:11.199
What can I get you?

21:11.201 --> 21:13.302
Uh... tequila soda
with some lime, please.

21:13.304 --> 21:14.706
Coming right up.

21:27.051 --> 21:29.017
Grace, it's your first day,
for God's sake.

21:29.019 --> 21:30.753
But it's already started.

21:30.755 --> 21:32.157
And you are overreacting.

21:32.623 --> 21:34.790
You look so different,
no one will ever know.

21:34.792 --> 21:35.757
What's happened?

21:35.759 --> 21:36.862
You called her Imogen.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.194
I'm sorry. But I don't think
that he heard me.

21:39.196 --> 21:40.795
No, he did.

21:40.797 --> 21:42.767
He spent the whole day
calling me Imogen.

21:43.034 --> 21:44.099
Okay.

21:44.101 --> 21:45.704
But it's just this one boy.

21:45.969 --> 21:48.704
- Yeah, and when he finds out...
- He's not going to.

21:48.706 --> 21:50.305
We cannot stay here.

21:50.307 --> 21:52.544
- Imogen.
- It's fucking Grace!

21:52.809 --> 21:54.879
Wait.

21:59.816 --> 22:01.819
Grace.

22:07.091 --> 22:08.927
What the fuck.

22:11.661 --> 22:12.863
Will?

22:14.297 --> 22:16.732
Yeah. Yep?

22:16.734 --> 22:17.836
Uh...

22:19.003 --> 22:21.102
I'm sorry.
I should have explained.

22:21.104 --> 22:22.905
- I should have warned you.
- Yeah.

22:22.907 --> 22:24.974
I've moved Grace's things
to the other room, obviously.

22:24.976 --> 22:26.678
- Good.
- And...

22:29.346 --> 22:30.981
I think I've figured this out.

22:32.882 --> 22:34.553
Now. If you look,

22:34.951 --> 22:38.123
there are two alternatives
for him, right?

22:38.922 --> 22:39.891
In the first one

22:40.857 --> 22:42.326
they're at peace. You see?

22:43.794 --> 22:44.763
And the girl...

22:46.796 --> 22:47.899
the girl is happy, see?

22:49.834 --> 22:50.936
The other future,

22:51.969 --> 22:56.607
the one that he chose,
is madness and carnage.

22:59.176 --> 23:01.146
See the way it leads
to the angels?

23:05.282 --> 23:07.719
He is a good artist.
He is a really good artist.

23:09.386 --> 23:10.721
He was a psycho.

23:12.123 --> 23:13.091
Paint over it.

23:14.825 --> 23:16.925
A shotgun? God!

23:16.927 --> 23:19.631
I found it in the attic,
I'm taking it to the cops.

23:20.797 --> 23:22.132
Hey. Hey!

23:26.770 --> 23:28.172
Do you know
what day it is today?

23:58.334 --> 23:59.935
I think I've got the bigger one.

24:03.473 --> 24:04.408
Happy anniversary.

24:04.941 --> 24:06.010
Happy anniversary.

24:21.257 --> 24:22.259
You know, um...

24:24.394 --> 24:26.495
I heard that they're setting up

24:26.497 --> 24:28.733
an adult learning center
in town.

24:29.365 --> 24:31.335
- Mm-hm.
- Cath mentioned it, and...

24:33.003 --> 24:34.939
I just thought maybe
you could teach there.

24:35.305 --> 24:36.775
You're a brilliant teacher.

24:37.274 --> 24:39.444
I'm not a teacher anymore, Sam.

24:40.510 --> 24:42.146
I don't want to teach.

24:42.446 --> 24:44.880
The only reason I taught was
to help you finish your degree,

24:44.882 --> 24:46.281
which I wanted to do, for you.

24:46.283 --> 24:48.283
I know, I was just thinking
it might be nice

24:48.285 --> 24:50.151
to have help with finances

24:50.153 --> 24:52.323
- and that we could find a way...
- Oh, okay. Great. Yeah.

24:56.392 --> 24:59.898
Okay, so you talked to Cath
about our family.

25:00.430 --> 25:02.096
Did you speak to her about...

25:02.098 --> 25:03.165
- Imogen?
- Yeah.

25:03.167 --> 25:04.769
Did you call Imogen "Grace"?

25:05.068 --> 25:06.968
Yes. Yes, I called her Grace.

25:06.970 --> 25:08.871
Okay. It's not a silly question,

25:08.873 --> 25:11.008
because Grace told me

25:11.542 --> 25:14.543
about at school,
at home, in the car.

25:14.545 --> 25:16.311
How hard is that to remember?

25:16.313 --> 25:18.147
You were the one that came up
with the name Grace.

25:18.149 --> 25:20.418
This is... important.

25:23.053 --> 25:24.486
What are you doing?

25:24.488 --> 25:26.056
Hey! No. Come here,
come here. I'm sorry.

25:28.359 --> 25:29.424
I'm sorry.

25:29.426 --> 25:31.062
Oh, fuck!

25:31.362 --> 25:34.399
I'm sorry, baby.
Now, look at me, please? Please.

25:35.298 --> 25:37.199
I'm sorry.

25:37.401 --> 25:38.902
No. It's just...

25:39.335 --> 25:41.439
Come here. You cold?

25:43.340 --> 25:44.242
No.

25:45.508 --> 25:46.411
That feels good.

25:47.210 --> 25:49.012
I love you,
you know that?

25:49.979 --> 25:50.914
I love you.

25:51.347 --> 25:52.450
I love you, too.

26:03.994 --> 26:05.561
These suckers
are driving me insane.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.232
I am going to have to get traps.

26:23.314 --> 26:26.017
You know, the bartender
tried to pick me up tonight?

26:26.417 --> 26:27.352
Hmm.

26:29.085 --> 26:30.087
Were you tempted?

26:57.248 --> 26:58.149
Sorry.

26:59.950 --> 27:02.085
It's okay.

27:07.524 --> 27:09.026
We still have Viagra.

27:12.528 --> 27:13.530
I'm just tired.

27:25.241 --> 27:26.143
You know...

27:27.611 --> 27:29.546
I keep having this fantasy.

27:32.115 --> 27:33.218
A stranger,

27:34.418 --> 27:35.620
from out of town...

27:37.554 --> 27:39.056
is looking at me...

27:40.990 --> 27:42.359
across a crowded room.

27:44.094 --> 27:45.296
He nods.

27:48.332 --> 27:49.601
And leaves.

27:50.566 --> 27:51.469
And...

27:52.436 --> 27:54.138
I get up and follow him.

27:56.073 --> 27:57.374
I get in my car.

28:00.143 --> 28:01.345
And he gets in.

28:04.547 --> 28:06.183
And he says: "Drive."

28:12.690 --> 28:13.892
Then what happens?

28:17.094 --> 28:18.228
I drive.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.400
Imogen.

28:57.301 --> 29:00.238
Imogen.

29:02.605 --> 29:04.541
Imogen.

29:06.744 --> 29:10.014
Imogen.

29:16.719 --> 29:18.288
- Mom?
- Fuck!

29:19.256 --> 29:20.354
There's someone
in the house.

29:20.356 --> 29:21.790
Oh, fuck!

29:21.792 --> 29:23.324
He's calling my name.
My old name.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.328
Okay. Um...

29:25.496 --> 29:26.727
Were you having a dream?

29:26.729 --> 29:29.230
- No! I wasn't.
- Grace.

29:29.232 --> 29:31.033
I swear,
there's someone in the house,

29:31.035 --> 29:32.136
I wasn't dreaming.

29:34.638 --> 29:36.007
Okay, I'll check it out.

30:06.603 --> 30:08.171
All quiet in the Western front.

30:09.139 --> 30:11.376
She's asleep,
so you can sleep in her bed.

31:46.870 --> 31:48.637
Go away, Dad!

31:48.639 --> 31:50.471
I'm not gonna hurt myself.

31:50.473 --> 31:51.374
I know.

31:52.375 --> 31:54.309
I wanted to make sure
you didn't get lost.

31:54.311 --> 31:57.178
Dad, you know I have a better
sense of direction than you.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.116
Yes, that's very true.

31:59.882 --> 32:01.384
Your gran called.

32:02.186 --> 32:03.254
Asked how you were.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.524
Just tell her to stop sending
those stupid old pictures of me.

32:07.757 --> 32:10.260
Why don't you give her a call
and tell her yourself?

32:10.661 --> 32:11.661
Please.

32:12.595 --> 32:13.597
Where are you going?

32:13.863 --> 32:14.899
Don't know!

32:16.799 --> 32:17.801
Okay.

32:35.352 --> 32:36.487
Be careful!

33:06.616 --> 33:08.816
<i>The bunker war
between the Montana chapters</i>

33:08.818 --> 33:12.722
<i>of Bandito Nation and Black Dawn
appears to be over</i>

33:12.956 --> 33:16.358
<i>as leaders from both gangs
met in Missoula last night.</i>

33:16.360 --> 33:19.761
<i>The conflict was inflamed
by the reported disappearance</i>

33:19.763 --> 33:23.864
<i>last month of two longtime
Black Dawn members.</i>

33:23.866 --> 33:27.571
<i>Bandito Nation leaders continue
to claim no involvement.</i>

33:28.037 --> 33:31.473
<i>News of the truce met
a guarded response from police,</i>

33:31.475 --> 33:33.244
<i>who indicated an alliance bet...</i>

34:27.563 --> 34:28.565
Mom?

34:30.100 --> 34:31.601
You must be Grace?

34:32.368 --> 34:34.271
- Yeah.
- You just missed her.

34:34.538 --> 34:36.471
- Damn.
- That's okay.

34:36.473 --> 34:37.675
I can take you home.

34:38.641 --> 34:39.777
Thanks.

34:40.476 --> 34:41.879
So why did you come here?

34:42.812 --> 34:44.813
We wanted to move
to the country.

34:45.947 --> 34:47.516
This place was going for cheap.

34:48.118 --> 34:49.620
Do you know why?

34:50.120 --> 34:52.389
Yeah,
some guy murdered the family.

34:54.024 --> 34:56.960
It wasn't some guy.
It was the father.

34:57.393 --> 35:00.564
He was about to make it big
before Joanne got sick.

35:01.964 --> 35:04.968
He set up his studio in a room
in the house to be close to her.

35:05.701 --> 35:07.071
How do you know that?

35:07.603 --> 35:10.004
He told me.
But he couldn't work.

35:10.006 --> 35:11.672
He had his wife
and a little girl

35:11.674 --> 35:12.810
to take care of.

35:13.442 --> 35:15.379
So why did he kill them?

35:16.480 --> 35:17.915
I figured he blamed them.

35:19.815 --> 35:21.051
What did he do?

35:21.917 --> 35:24.521
One day,
he goes into Joe's Hardware,

35:24.788 --> 35:26.087
buys a hunting knife,

35:26.089 --> 35:28.426
goes straight home
and stabs them.

35:28.892 --> 35:31.025
His daughter first,
right in front of Joanne.

35:31.027 --> 35:32.897
- How old was she?
- Twelve.

35:33.562 --> 35:35.765
Joanne is watching her baby die,

35:36.466 --> 35:38.768
and her in a wheelchair,
just helpless.

35:39.502 --> 35:40.835
Then he cuts her throat.

35:40.837 --> 35:42.506
And hangs himself.

35:42.939 --> 35:44.607
Not right away. Get this.

35:44.808 --> 35:47.445
He stayed in that room
for a whole week.

35:47.877 --> 35:50.647
He slept in that room,
right next to their bodies.

35:53.450 --> 35:54.685
And then he hanged himself.

35:55.752 --> 35:56.954
Which room?

35:57.620 --> 35:58.823
Don't know.

36:01.123 --> 36:02.526
I know.

36:04.995 --> 36:07.895
So you want to come inside
for a second?

36:07.897 --> 36:09.933
Maybe next time.

36:11.067 --> 36:12.803
Hey, I didn't mean
to freak you out.

36:13.636 --> 36:14.671
It's fine.

36:15.205 --> 36:17.408
People are way scarier
than ghosts.

36:37.761 --> 36:38.963
- Hey.
- Hello.

36:41.230 --> 36:43.133
You okay?

36:43.632 --> 36:44.734
Mhm.

36:49.138 --> 36:50.640
She needs to go to school.

36:51.507 --> 36:53.843
Yes, definitely.

36:56.913 --> 36:59.450
Is this your new project?

36:59.915 --> 37:02.085
- Mhm.
- Huh.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.656
Are you copying the painting?

37:07.991 --> 37:10.060
Well, I'm re-imagining it...

37:10.627 --> 37:12.663
- in three dimensions.
- Hmm.

37:14.631 --> 37:15.866
You hate it?

37:18.768 --> 37:20.103
Is it a bit derivative?

37:24.107 --> 37:26.576
And you wonder why
I can't perform.

37:27.076 --> 37:27.877
What?

37:28.844 --> 37:31.045
The first time
in a long time

37:31.047 --> 37:32.516
that I've felt inspired...

37:32.948 --> 37:33.915
and you come in...

37:33.917 --> 37:34.985
And it's my fault?

37:37.687 --> 37:39.089
Well, you're not helping.

37:40.656 --> 37:41.925
Sorry for asking questions.

38:24.801 --> 38:26.067
What?

38:26.069 --> 38:27.701
- My God, that isn't funny!
- What?

38:31.640 --> 38:32.709
Get rid of it.

38:33.576 --> 38:34.944
I didn't put that there.

39:44.381 --> 39:45.946
I don't want to go.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.084
Well, you have to.
It's the law.

39:48.685 --> 39:50.350
What about home schooling?

39:50.352 --> 39:52.085
You want me
to quit my job?

39:52.087 --> 39:54.154
No, but Dad's home
all the time. Maybe...

39:54.156 --> 39:55.625
Working. I work.

39:55.959 --> 39:57.891
I know,
but maybe you could just...

39:57.893 --> 39:59.259
You're saying my work is ugly,

39:59.261 --> 40:00.728
that it's not real work.

40:00.730 --> 40:02.163
She didn't say that.

40:02.165 --> 40:04.098
I'm consumed every minute
of every day.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.799
I don't switch off
at five o'clock.

40:05.801 --> 40:07.701
I still have to be a good Dad,

40:07.703 --> 40:10.971
and I have to be a good husband.
And I want to be those things.

40:10.973 --> 40:12.642
Grace, in the car.

40:18.114 --> 40:19.249
I'll call you.

40:19.783 --> 40:22.016
I'll be working
and then cooking.

40:22.018 --> 40:24.221
Don't cook for me,
I'll be at Tony's.

40:26.221 --> 40:27.725
You look great.

40:35.864 --> 40:38.267
I'm sorry. I know
that you're going through a lot.

40:38.868 --> 40:39.966
I just don't want...

40:39.968 --> 40:41.171
Mom...

40:42.205 --> 40:43.774
it just sucks.

40:45.140 --> 40:46.175
Yeah.

40:48.111 --> 40:49.379
It sucks.

40:53.248 --> 40:56.183
Should I make
a Skype appointment

40:56.185 --> 40:58.085
for you to speak with Cassandra?

40:58.087 --> 40:59.922
I don't need more therapy.

41:02.826 --> 41:03.991
Send Dad.

41:17.272 --> 41:18.675
Hey, Grace.

41:20.743 --> 41:22.946
Where were you yesterday...
Grace?

41:25.013 --> 41:26.015
Grace.

41:26.815 --> 41:28.451
Did you hear me, Grace?

41:31.120 --> 41:33.420
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

41:34.790 --> 41:36.491
Come on, Will. Pick up.

41:36.493 --> 41:38.027
This is pissing me off.

41:39.462 --> 41:41.161
He's just being a baby!

41:41.163 --> 41:42.929
If you need to go,
I can stay.

41:42.931 --> 41:44.000
No.

41:44.901 --> 41:46.203
Screw him.

42:15.931 --> 42:16.866
Need help?

42:18.033 --> 42:19.466
I'm okay.

42:19.468 --> 42:22.238
- Sorry, I thought...
- No, I... I know.

42:23.939 --> 42:25.274
So, uh...

42:26.942 --> 42:28.408
you hear about
the abandoned house

42:28.410 --> 42:29.746
in Boulder River?

42:30.078 --> 42:32.346
It's a bit of a hike
but totally worth it.

42:32.348 --> 42:33.980
If you want, I could take you.

42:33.982 --> 42:35.785
- You'd love it. The river is...
- I...

42:36.118 --> 42:37.919
can't go.
It would just be a blur.

42:39.489 --> 42:42.426
Okay,
but if you change your mind...

42:46.962 --> 42:48.098
Problem?

42:48.564 --> 42:50.066
You lose something?

42:50.899 --> 42:52.035
Give it back.

42:52.902 --> 42:54.538
- Excuse me?
- My iPad.

42:55.839 --> 42:57.071
What?

42:57.073 --> 42:58.873
- Did you take it?
- No.

42:58.875 --> 43:00.574
Yes, you did.
It was just right there!

43:00.576 --> 43:02.513
I didn't take
your fucking iPad.

43:03.212 --> 43:04.846
I've been nothing
but nice to you,

43:04.848 --> 43:06.550
but for some reason,
you have it in for me.

43:07.584 --> 43:09.085
You're a psycho.

43:13.256 --> 43:14.522
Don't worry,
I'll get it back.

43:14.524 --> 43:16.058
Shh!

43:21.464 --> 43:23.230
You want to go grab a drink?

43:23.232 --> 43:24.801
I'm headed to the gym.

43:25.268 --> 43:26.503
Good on you.

43:57.500 --> 43:58.966
Hi.

44:00.636 --> 44:02.236
Eugene?

44:02.238 --> 44:03.306
Yeah.

44:04.239 --> 44:07.210
Did you knock on the door
and get back on your horse?

44:09.145 --> 44:10.614
Yeah.

44:13.116 --> 44:15.016
Um, here.

44:15.018 --> 44:17.286
I thought you could use this.
It's my old one.

44:18.087 --> 44:19.890
You can have it
until we find yours.

44:20.455 --> 44:21.858
Okay.

44:23.459 --> 44:24.895
Thanks.

44:26.129 --> 44:27.364
You know, I...

44:28.364 --> 44:30.132
always wondered
what it's like inside.

44:34.671 --> 44:35.638
He had a real...

44:36.439 --> 44:38.007
death fixation.

44:38.540 --> 44:39.942
I guess.

44:40.643 --> 44:42.179
So your Dad paints too?

44:42.377 --> 44:44.347
- Yeah.
- Is he famous?

44:45.047 --> 44:48.281
No. I mean, he's sold stuff.

44:48.283 --> 44:49.552
Cool.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.319
Can I see some?

44:52.321 --> 44:54.087
Maybe another time.
He's working right now.

44:54.089 --> 44:56.089
Sure. I've got homework
to do anyway.

44:56.091 --> 44:57.960
So, I'll get out of your hair.

45:00.129 --> 45:03.933
Hey, I know Brandon's giving you
a hard time.

45:04.500 --> 45:05.669
He's a creep.

45:06.102 --> 45:07.304
Yeah.

45:08.404 --> 45:11.007
And if you want to go
to Boulder River, let me know.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.442
We'll take Charlie.

45:13.375 --> 45:14.578
Charlie?

45:15.277 --> 45:16.544
My horse.

45:49.544 --> 45:50.446
Tony.

45:51.279 --> 45:52.415
Another one.

46:13.669 --> 46:15.268
Here you go.

46:19.207 --> 46:20.376
Thank you.

46:22.344 --> 46:23.747
Sam.

46:24.279 --> 46:25.281
Oh.

46:28.417 --> 46:30.219
Is that an invitation?

46:31.353 --> 46:32.553
No.

48:28.171 --> 48:29.506
Did you enjoy my drink?

48:32.274 --> 48:34.643
I figured one more
would take you over the limit.

48:35.210 --> 48:38.448
So you're performing
a community service?

48:41.651 --> 48:43.120
I'm going home.

48:43.718 --> 48:45.154
Me too.

48:46.254 --> 48:48.325
- Where's that?
- Calgary.

49:42.712 --> 49:44.314
Keep driving.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.695
Stop.

51:40.763 --> 51:41.765
Hey?

51:44.433 --> 51:45.669
Hey, I've got to go.

51:51.607 --> 51:52.776
Hello?

51:56.946 --> 51:58.315
Hello?

52:03.419 --> 52:04.721
All right, I'm going.

52:10.024 --> 52:12.661
All right, fuck you.
I'm leaving.

52:36.451 --> 52:37.520
Shit!

52:38.921 --> 52:41.056
Fuck.

52:46.462 --> 52:48.495
Okay.

52:51.734 --> 52:52.835
No.

52:57.540 --> 52:59.109
Okay.

53:09.451 --> 53:10.853
The radiator's cracked.

53:11.085 --> 53:12.555
It's lost all the coolant.

53:17.125 --> 53:18.625
What were you doing here?

53:18.627 --> 53:20.063
I got lost.

53:21.163 --> 53:23.433
Our place is the very next road.

53:23.765 --> 53:25.033
I took a wrong turn.

53:27.102 --> 53:28.705
Going to have to get it towed.

53:29.538 --> 53:30.607
Shit.

53:30.806 --> 53:32.776
- Grab your stuff.
- Yeah.

53:43.152 --> 53:44.454
What's this?

53:46.120 --> 53:47.423
I don't know.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.095
Have you got everything?

53:52.727 --> 53:53.962
Yeah.

54:52.187 --> 54:53.256
Will?

54:54.290 --> 54:55.221
Will?

54:55.223 --> 54:56.593
Yeah, I'm in here.

55:01.297 --> 55:05.732
Just now, did you draw a hangman
on the bathroom mirror?

55:05.734 --> 55:07.000
No.

55:07.002 --> 55:08.505
I've been here
since we got back.

55:12.140 --> 55:13.574
Then it must be Imogen.

55:13.576 --> 55:15.341
She's just trying
to mess with us

55:15.343 --> 55:17.279
and get us
out of this house.

55:18.980 --> 55:20.049
I don't know.

55:21.649 --> 55:22.751
Look.

55:24.687 --> 55:26.922
How did this hat
come to be near your car?

55:30.692 --> 55:32.194
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

55:38.200 --> 55:39.602
I don't know.

55:39.868 --> 55:41.170
Hey, it's okay.

55:41.603 --> 55:42.739
Oh, come on.

55:49.210 --> 55:51.013
Don't worry, I'll sort it out.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.048
Okay?

55:54.315 --> 55:55.651
Yeah.

56:04.893 --> 56:06.826
We just wanted you to see.

56:08.696 --> 56:10.830
Imogen, Imogen, Imogen.

56:10.832 --> 56:13.100
You've got to see this.

56:13.102 --> 56:15.238
Imogen!

56:28.183 --> 56:31.984
Imogen!

58:25.533 --> 58:26.835
Bye.

59:04.439 --> 59:05.507
Can I help you?

59:06.575 --> 59:09.178
Oh, I'm just looking
for the owner of this truck.

59:09.944 --> 59:11.046
That's me.

59:14.183 --> 59:15.418
Excuse me.

59:16.118 --> 59:17.286
Sorry.

59:24.493 --> 59:26.529
Hey,
I'm going to walk home today.

59:27.062 --> 59:29.297
- Are you sure?
- I'll be fine, Dad.

59:30.064 --> 59:31.833
Okay. Bye.

59:58.893 --> 01:00:01.263
Fuck.

01:00:04.933 --> 01:00:06.232
Sam?

01:00:06.234 --> 01:00:08.134
Oh, hey.
I can't find my key.

01:00:08.136 --> 01:00:10.540
- It's okay. I've got it.
- Thanks.

01:00:19.114 --> 01:00:21.248
We need to order
some more vitamins today.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.218
Yeah.

01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:27.255
Oh, shit.
The starter cash is gone.

01:00:28.156 --> 01:00:29.859
And a whole lot of oxycodone.

01:00:31.526 --> 01:00:33.129
I'm going to call the cops.

01:00:38.232 --> 01:00:39.334
Shit.

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:14.234
<i>And then I got up
to go to the restroom</i>

01:01:14.236 --> 01:01:17.205
<i>and I must have left
my bag on the table.</i>

01:01:18.406 --> 01:01:20.040
Who else was in the bar?

01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:23.009
Not many people.
Tony, a couple of other guys.

01:01:23.011 --> 01:01:25.111
They were there
the other night... Cath?

01:01:25.113 --> 01:01:27.080
- Lui and George.
- Mm.

01:01:27.082 --> 01:01:28.448
I'll have a word with them.

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:30.118
No, it wasn't them.

01:01:30.685 --> 01:01:34.187
There was this one other guy
who was there,

01:01:34.189 --> 01:01:36.089
and he kept looking at me.

01:01:36.091 --> 01:01:37.357
Describe him.

01:01:38.727 --> 01:01:40.395
I don't really remember.
It's...

01:01:41.163 --> 01:01:43.163
- so dark in there.
- You don't remember

01:01:43.165 --> 01:01:44.233
what he looked like?

01:01:46.368 --> 01:01:49.071
All right.
Well, maybe Tony will.

01:04:59.828 --> 01:05:01.163
Fuck!

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:03.599
Jesus.

01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:58.353
- We need to find a new house.
- But...

01:05:59.553 --> 01:06:01.353
- We're not in danger.
- What?

01:06:01.355 --> 01:06:03.922
He's just trying to make
his presence known.

01:06:03.924 --> 01:06:06.394
- He?
- And show us it's not Grace.

01:06:06.694 --> 01:06:08.560
Are you listening
to what you're saying?

01:06:08.562 --> 01:06:11.200
You just confirmed the presence
of a ghost in this house.

01:06:11.433 --> 01:06:12.665
So do we...

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:13.736
We leave.

01:06:15.002 --> 01:06:16.305
We're leaving.

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:18.474
We're leaving.

01:06:19.274 --> 01:06:20.973
- No.
- I want to leave too.

01:06:20.975 --> 01:06:22.475
No!

01:06:22.477 --> 01:06:23.875
You don't care at all
how we feel.

01:06:23.877 --> 01:06:25.877
Yes,
of course I care. Of course.

01:06:25.879 --> 01:06:27.913
I moved halfway
across the country.

01:06:27.915 --> 01:06:29.549
I gave up
that commission, remember?

01:06:29.551 --> 01:06:31.319
- Yes, I remember that.
- Yeah.

01:06:31.852 --> 01:06:33.252
We didn't know at the time

01:06:33.254 --> 01:06:34.886
that this is what
it would be like.

01:06:34.888 --> 01:06:36.422
Like what?

01:06:36.424 --> 01:06:37.857
- No one's been hurt.
- Not yet.

01:06:37.859 --> 01:06:39.792
I can't believe
I'm debating you on this.

01:06:39.794 --> 01:06:42.395
Listen,
if he wanted to hurt Grace,

01:06:42.397 --> 01:06:44.529
he could have.
He went for the camera.

01:06:44.531 --> 01:06:47.266
- He was protecting you.
- Protecting? Jesus.

01:06:47.268 --> 01:06:49.601
I'm being logical.
There is no reason to go.

01:06:49.603 --> 01:06:52.371
- And I'm doing my best work.
- Good for you.

01:06:52.373 --> 01:06:54.973
You keep doing your best work.
We'll find a place in town.

01:06:54.975 --> 01:06:57.009
In town? I thought you said
we we're leaving?

01:06:57.011 --> 01:06:58.710
I just bought
the drug store.

01:06:58.712 --> 01:07:00.446
We cannot afford
to move right now.

01:07:00.448 --> 01:07:02.250
I hate this town!

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.855
Shut up!

01:07:07.355 --> 01:07:08.955
You go and do
whatever you have to do.

01:07:08.957 --> 01:07:10.491
I'm going to be working.

01:07:13.828 --> 01:07:14.997
I hear you.

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:18.031
<i>Come on!</i>

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:19.966
<i>Come on, Sarah,
you lost the dare.</i>

01:07:24.439 --> 01:07:26.642
What is it? Wait.

01:07:26.975 --> 01:07:28.473
We've got to find Imogen.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.547
- Get down.
- What?

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:35.582
I want to see.

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:37.453
Just walk in.
It's not like she can see.

01:07:37.852 --> 01:07:39.685
Imogen! Imogen!

01:07:39.687 --> 01:07:42.721
<i>Imogen! Imogen! Imogen!</i>

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.462
Where are you going today?

01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:25.529
School's the other way,
you know.

01:08:25.532 --> 01:08:26.801
The big blue building.

01:08:29.636 --> 01:08:32.041
I know you're blind,
but you're not that blind.

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:38.613
I found your iPad.

01:08:41.983 --> 01:08:45.654
I looked through
your Nana's holiday snaps.

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:47.788
I know you're albino.

01:08:50.524 --> 01:08:52.960
And I did some web surfing.

01:08:53.894 --> 01:08:54.696
I found your video.

01:08:57.497 --> 01:08:59.068
Some people
are just such assholes.

01:09:01.836 --> 01:09:03.005
What do you want?

01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:05.773
What I've always wanted.

01:09:05.974 --> 01:09:07.542
Just to be friends.

01:09:08.675 --> 01:09:11.645
No cameras this time.
I'll keep this our secret.

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:46.712
Turns out Tony
has some security footage

01:09:46.714 --> 01:09:47.881
for us to review together.

01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:52.785
Oh, that's great.
From inside the bar?

01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:54.390
Yeah, and outside.

01:09:56.023 --> 01:09:57.392
Now a good time?

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.497
Yes. Let me just get my stuff.

01:10:02.964 --> 01:10:05.164
Hey, Cath, I've got to go answer
some questions.

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.769
Did they find the guy?

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:33.529
I'm sorry. I didn't want
my husband to know. I've...

01:10:35.028 --> 01:10:36.898
never done anything
like this before.

01:10:38.899 --> 01:10:40.635
It was a stupid thing to do.

01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:43.971
Do you know who he is?

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:49.077
You let a stranger
get into your car?

01:10:50.644 --> 01:10:52.080
And then you drove off with him?

01:10:52.279 --> 01:10:53.815
He was a trucker.

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:58.220
He said he was from Calgary.

01:11:01.089 --> 01:11:02.524
Does it matter?

01:11:04.024 --> 01:11:05.958
I don't want to press charges.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.696
We need to release this footage.

01:11:08.662 --> 01:11:10.228
No. Please.

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:12.733
You won't be identified.
We're only interested in him.

01:11:14.102 --> 01:11:15.604
What did he do?

01:11:28.882 --> 01:11:30.051
Dad?

01:11:31.952 --> 01:11:33.154
Dad?

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.696
Dad?

01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:15.764
Grace, what the hell's wrong
with you?

01:12:16.063 --> 01:12:17.532
I didn't do this.

01:12:18.065 --> 01:12:20.333
- This is hours of work!
- I didn't do this!

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:21.734
Yes, you did.

01:12:21.736 --> 01:12:23.005
- What are you doing home?
- Dad!

01:12:24.304 --> 01:12:25.907
The video is up again.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.307
It's not.
I've been checking every day.

01:12:28.309 --> 01:12:29.941
I've been checking. It's not up.

01:12:29.943 --> 01:12:31.712
It is. He found it.

01:12:34.181 --> 01:12:36.915
- Jesus Christ.
- We have to move.

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:38.651
No,
we don't have to move.

01:12:38.653 --> 01:12:39.721
You just deny it.

01:12:40.054 --> 01:12:42.253
He recognized me.
He'll tell everyone.

01:12:42.255 --> 01:12:44.824
- And did you admit it?
- I didn't have to.

01:12:44.826 --> 01:12:46.325
Then you deny it, Grace.

01:12:46.327 --> 01:12:48.060
Dad, we have to move!

01:12:48.062 --> 01:12:50.161
Grace, where will go,
fucking Mars?

01:12:50.163 --> 01:12:51.896
This will follow us everywhere.

01:12:51.898 --> 01:12:53.999
I don't know!
We just keep moving.

01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:56.768
Listen, you were stupid
enough to screw around.

01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:59.840
Now you have to live with that.
We all have to live with that.

01:13:05.912 --> 01:13:06.948
Grace.

01:13:16.357 --> 01:13:17.292
How was work?

01:13:17.959 --> 01:13:19.027
Okay.

01:13:20.161 --> 01:13:23.832
- You?
- Good. Fine. Yeah.

01:13:25.966 --> 01:13:27.835
I think our ghost
likes the news channel.

01:13:29.202 --> 01:13:30.339
Who likes news?

01:13:31.672 --> 01:13:32.873
- Oh.
- Mm.

01:13:34.908 --> 01:13:37.045
Did you do any house hunting?

01:13:38.045 --> 01:13:39.614
No. Why?

01:13:40.915 --> 01:13:42.216
Did you change your mind?

01:13:44.152 --> 01:13:45.187
No.

01:13:49.389 --> 01:13:50.959
Is the car running okay?

01:13:51.224 --> 01:13:53.191
Yes, good as new.

01:13:53.193 --> 01:13:54.759
I need to do homework.

01:13:54.761 --> 01:13:56.061
Grace, if you're scared,
I can...

01:13:56.063 --> 01:13:58.866
- I'm not scared.
- Grace.

01:14:00.334 --> 01:14:01.836
Um, I...

01:14:04.839 --> 01:14:05.974
I'll get the clip down.

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:09.211
And I'm very sorry
for the way I spoke to you.

01:14:27.461 --> 01:14:31.265
My name is Imogen Day.

01:14:32.733 --> 01:14:33.768
Um...

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:38.373
a video went up of me online.

01:14:39.372 --> 01:14:41.742
And, um...

01:14:43.243 --> 01:14:45.080
I tried to start over.

01:14:48.215 --> 01:14:50.251
But it's a sick fucking world.

01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:54.322
So, uh...

01:14:56.023 --> 01:14:59.861
to everyone who has tortured me
for this past year...

01:15:01.528 --> 01:15:02.763
you won.

01:15:05.532 --> 01:15:07.102
I hope you're happy.

01:18:55.395 --> 01:18:58.099
Grace, come on.
We're going to be late.

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:08.977
What have you done?

01:19:10.644 --> 01:19:12.447
I wanted to look like me again.

01:19:13.346 --> 01:19:14.679
I thought the point

01:19:14.681 --> 01:19:16.483
was that you didn't want
to look like you?

01:19:17.251 --> 01:19:19.084
I don't care anymore.

01:19:19.086 --> 01:19:20.718
Grace,
what if the video's up?

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.256
Well, fuck them.

01:19:22.689 --> 01:19:24.323
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:19:24.325 --> 01:19:25.727
They can all just go to hell.

01:19:50.818 --> 01:19:53.154
Abandoned house tonight
at seven, okay?

01:19:56.157 --> 01:19:57.225
You okay?

01:19:57.791 --> 01:19:59.160
Yeah.

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.062
Thanks.

01:20:01.595 --> 01:20:02.697
Imogen.

01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:05.399
You look amazing.

01:20:35.328 --> 01:20:37.228
<i>...were leaked online.</i>

01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:40.164
<i>Mayor Larson questioned
the timing of the revelations</i>

01:20:40.166 --> 01:20:42.703
<i>that appear a month out
from county elections.</i>

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:44.869
<i>She defended the record
of this administration</i>

01:20:44.871 --> 01:20:46.437
<i>and its effort...</i>

01:20:46.439 --> 01:20:47.505
<i>Police have confirmed</i>

01:20:47.507 --> 01:20:49.044
<i>the man pictured is Jason Adair,</i>

01:20:49.376 --> 01:20:51.780
<i>former stand-over man
and convicted felon,</i>

01:20:52.212 --> 01:20:55.414
<i>seen here talking to a local
outside Tony's Bar.</i>

01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:59.183
<i>Adair is wanted for his part
in the killing of three members</i>

01:20:59.185 --> 01:21:02.154
<i>of the Black Dawn
motorcycle gang in March.</i>

01:21:02.156 --> 01:21:04.222
<i>And was, in fact,
believed to be dead</i>

01:21:04.224 --> 01:21:05.557
<i>or in deep hiding until this...</i>

01:21:32.286 --> 01:21:34.189
Never going to be
afraid again.

01:21:35.656 --> 01:21:39.461
Never going to be ashamed.

01:21:40.461 --> 01:21:42.730
Never going to let them
get away with it.

01:21:44.364 --> 01:21:45.666
Because if you do...

01:21:46.332 --> 01:21:50.705
they'll just fuck you over
again and again.

01:21:52.438 --> 01:21:54.142
And it's not fair.

01:21:58.211 --> 01:21:59.746
You just have to stop them.

01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:45.893
You ready to come inside?

01:22:46.693 --> 01:22:47.895
Not yet.

01:22:48.795 --> 01:22:50.361
Are you scared?

01:22:50.363 --> 01:22:52.466
My house is scarier.

01:22:54.867 --> 01:22:56.236
So...

01:22:57.270 --> 01:23:00.507
if I do this,
you promise to leave me alone?

01:23:01.575 --> 01:23:02.743
I promise.

01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:05.580
You haven't told
anyone else about me?

01:23:06.412 --> 01:23:07.514
No.

01:23:08.014 --> 01:23:09.316
You swear?

01:23:09.817 --> 01:23:10.919
I swear.

01:23:12.752 --> 01:23:15.255
You fucking liar.

01:23:19.526 --> 01:23:20.428
What?

01:23:21.528 --> 01:23:22.964
You told Eugene.

01:23:23.397 --> 01:23:24.866
You're both fucking liars!

01:23:30.336 --> 01:23:31.371
Okay.

01:23:31.772 --> 01:23:32.974
So I told Eugene.

01:23:33.674 --> 01:23:34.940
But that's it.

01:23:34.942 --> 01:23:36.374
If you want to keep it
that way...

01:23:36.376 --> 01:23:37.745
- I don't care.
- Hey!

01:23:38.511 --> 01:23:39.543
Hey, don't be stupid.

01:23:39.545 --> 01:23:40.544
Come here.

01:23:40.546 --> 01:23:42.713
Ah! Fuck!

01:23:42.715 --> 01:23:44.318
You want to rape me?

01:23:44.852 --> 01:23:46.720
You better just kill me first.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.655
You have a death wish?

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:50.892
Maybe.

01:23:51.524 --> 01:23:53.357
You're crazy.
You can't even see me.

01:23:53.359 --> 01:23:54.661
I can smell you.

01:23:58.866 --> 01:23:59.934
Eugene!

01:24:00.768 --> 01:24:01.935
What?

01:24:04.071 --> 01:24:05.570
Eugene?

01:24:05.572 --> 01:24:07.007
Ah!

01:24:08.608 --> 01:24:09.908
Eugene!

01:24:12.746 --> 01:24:13.748
Who the fuck are you?

01:24:39.706 --> 01:24:41.675
You fucking pigs.

01:24:45.045 --> 01:24:46.948
<i>911,
what is your emergency?</i>

01:24:48.114 --> 01:24:49.614
<i>Hello?</i>

01:24:49.616 --> 01:24:51.415
<i>...and convicted felon.</i>

01:24:51.417 --> 01:24:52.584
- Oh my God.
- <i>Seen talking</i>

01:24:52.586 --> 01:24:54.418
<i>to a local outside Tony's Bar.</i>

01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:55.986
Who is he with?

01:24:55.988 --> 01:24:57.054
<i>...Adair is wanted
for his part</i>

01:24:57.056 --> 01:24:58.856
<i>in the killing of three members</i>

01:24:58.858 --> 01:25:01.662
<i>of the Black Dawn
motorcycle gang in March.</i>

01:25:02.062 --> 01:25:04.666
<i>Adair reportedly has
a contract out on him,</i>

01:25:04.898 --> 01:25:08.700
<i>and was, in fact, believed
to be dead or in deep hiding</i>

01:25:08.702 --> 01:25:10.468
<i>until this video surfaced.</i>

01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:12.503
If I could get closer,
I could make it out.

01:25:12.505 --> 01:25:14.539
<i>It's likely he is
still in the Livingston area.</i>

01:25:14.541 --> 01:25:17.776
<i>They are calling on the public
to remain vigilant.</i>

01:25:17.778 --> 01:25:21.413
<i>If anyone has information
or believes they've seen Adair,</i>

01:25:21.415 --> 01:25:23.115
- <i>contact the police immediately.</i>
- I've got to go.

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:24.783
Sam?

01:25:24.785 --> 01:25:25.987
See you tomorrow.

01:26:28.448 --> 01:26:29.149
Oh my God.

01:26:35.855 --> 01:26:37.157
I'm so sorry.

01:26:45.565 --> 01:26:46.834
Why would you do this, Sam?

01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:59.746
I... I don't...

01:27:01.614 --> 01:27:02.716
I was...

01:27:03.584 --> 01:27:05.653
I was frustrated, and...

01:27:06.519 --> 01:27:08.922
I was hurting. And I just...

01:27:09.656 --> 01:27:11.690
We haven't been good...

01:27:11.692 --> 01:27:14.726
So you punish me
because I couldn't fuck you.

01:27:14.728 --> 01:27:15.997
No.

01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:18.797
I fucked up.

01:27:18.799 --> 01:27:20.635
So at a bar...

01:27:21.134 --> 01:27:25.102
you pick up this guy
who's a murderer, a killer.

01:27:25.104 --> 01:27:27.140
I didn't know that.
I didn't.

01:27:27.741 --> 01:27:29.676
So you just pick up
a stranger.

01:27:38.919 --> 01:27:40.151
What's going on?

01:27:40.153 --> 01:27:41.556
Nothing. Go to your room.

01:27:44.023 --> 01:27:46.059
Oh my God. What happened?

01:27:46.859 --> 01:27:47.862
What...?

01:27:48.228 --> 01:27:50.027
I want you to stay,

01:27:50.029 --> 01:27:52.062
and I want you to look
at the man in these pictures.

01:27:52.064 --> 01:27:54.164
You look at his face.
You see this guy?

01:27:54.166 --> 01:27:56.301
Will, please don't.

01:27:56.303 --> 01:27:57.869
He's a friend
of your mom's.

01:27:57.871 --> 01:27:59.670
He did t... Shut up!

01:27:59.672 --> 01:28:02.477
He did time for manslaughter.

01:28:03.042 --> 01:28:06.011
Then when he got out,
he killed more people.

01:28:06.013 --> 01:28:07.311
Then he fucked your mother.

01:28:07.313 --> 01:28:08.215
Will.

01:28:09.148 --> 01:28:10.183
Because I couldn't.

01:28:11.984 --> 01:28:13.651
And I couldn't because of you.

01:28:13.653 --> 01:28:15.085
Do not make this about her!

01:28:15.087 --> 01:28:19.059
Ever since
that fucking video surfaced

01:28:19.826 --> 01:28:22.694
I can't function.
I am not a man. I can't work.

01:28:22.696 --> 01:28:25.163
You can't work because
you fucking ran out of ideas!

01:28:25.165 --> 01:28:27.969
- Grace!
- Stop blaming my fucking video!

01:28:28.635 --> 01:28:30.738
I have done everything
for you two.

01:28:31.237 --> 01:28:34.338
I moved us
across the fucking country!

01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:37.008
We moved
because you were ashamed of me!

01:28:39.145 --> 01:28:41.879
You both make me feel
so ashamed.

01:28:41.881 --> 01:28:43.216
Fuck!

01:28:43.817 --> 01:28:46.084
- I have fucking had it with you!
- Will!

01:28:47.354 --> 01:28:48.587
- Will!
- Fuck!

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:50.088
Dad!

01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:51.356
- Fuck!
- Stop it!

01:28:51.358 --> 01:28:53.792
Will! Will.

01:28:55.895 --> 01:28:57.361
Put that thing down.

01:28:59.166 --> 01:29:01.235
Put that down.

01:29:04.871 --> 01:29:06.641
Dad.

01:29:39.739 --> 01:29:40.974
Imogen.

01:29:43.276 --> 01:29:45.313
Imogen.

01:29:49.649 --> 01:29:50.981
Imogen.

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:22.817
Jason?

01:30:44.336 --> 01:30:46.272
Ah, fuck.

01:30:49.809 --> 01:30:51.344
Come on. Come on.

01:31:09.062 --> 01:31:11.431
What have you been doing
for the last two days?

01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:25.011
I keep having this fantasy.

01:31:25.879 --> 01:31:28.849
A stranger from out of town

01:31:29.416 --> 01:31:32.953
is looking at me
across a crowded room.

01:31:33.385 --> 01:31:35.085
Dad, we have to move!

01:31:35.087 --> 01:31:37.088
Grace, where will we go,
fucking Mars?

01:31:37.090 --> 01:31:39.160
This thing is going
to follow us everywhere.

01:31:49.236 --> 01:31:51.168
Imogen.

01:32:02.782 --> 01:32:04.783
- Jesus. I'll get my mom.
- No.

01:32:04.785 --> 01:32:06.116
She knows first aid.

01:32:06.118 --> 01:32:07.985
- No.
- You need a doctor.

01:32:07.987 --> 01:32:10.221
No,
they'll call the cops.

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.125
I know a guy that can help me.

01:32:15.127 --> 01:32:16.831
I've just got to get to him.

01:32:17.797 --> 01:32:18.933
And then what?

01:32:21.468 --> 01:32:22.803
I don't know.

01:32:28.207 --> 01:32:30.745
Find another roof?

01:32:32.278 --> 01:32:34.147
You told me hiding is shit.

01:32:35.447 --> 01:32:39.919
Yeah. You have
no reason to hide.

01:32:41.453 --> 01:32:42.956
I have no choice.

01:32:48.461 --> 01:32:49.897
By the way...

01:32:51.031 --> 01:32:52.500
when I said, "Fuck them,"

01:32:53.265 --> 01:32:56.103
I meant, fucking ignore them.

01:32:56.435 --> 01:32:58.205
Not fucking kill them.

01:33:00.372 --> 01:33:02.143
So why did you stay?

01:33:08.915 --> 01:33:10.484
You looked like
you needed some help.

01:33:15.154 --> 01:33:18.058
Anyway, I'm going to take
a leaf out of your book.

01:33:19.225 --> 01:33:20.460
And do what?

01:33:24.363 --> 01:33:26.263
I'm going to become
somebody else.

01:33:28.501 --> 01:33:30.037
But I need your help.

01:33:31.203 --> 01:33:33.006
<i>There's a couple of bikes</i>

01:33:33.305 --> 01:33:35.276
<i>dumped in the reeds
by the river.</i>

01:33:36.977 --> 01:33:39.246
<i>I'm going to need you
to dig up the keys.</i>

01:33:44.084 --> 01:33:46.884
<i>And then I promise
I'm going to leave you</i>

01:33:46.886 --> 01:33:48.421
<i>and your family alone.</i>

01:33:52.224 --> 01:33:53.227
...two...

01:33:54.394 --> 01:33:55.329
three...

01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:57.364
four.

01:35:06.733 --> 01:35:08.469
Fuck.

01:35:10.403 --> 01:35:11.502
Grace?

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.314
Grace?

01:36:35.188 --> 01:36:36.323
Imogen?

01:36:43.595 --> 01:36:44.732
Imogen?

01:36:45.130 --> 01:36:47.100
Hey, hey, what happened?

01:36:47.399 --> 01:36:48.568
I don't know. I...

01:36:50.603 --> 01:36:52.072
I can't feel my legs.

01:36:52.471 --> 01:36:54.739
What?

01:36:54.741 --> 01:36:56.707
- I can't feel my legs.
- Wait. What?

01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:58.578
I'm going to call 911, okay?

01:36:59.479 --> 01:37:00.647
I'm sorry.

01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:02.248
Why?

01:37:02.514 --> 01:37:04.582
I called you Imogen. I meant...
