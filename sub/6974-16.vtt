00:22.756 --> 00:25.691
Easy there, hon.

00:25.759 --> 00:32.528
You're cleaning so hard l'm afraid you're
gonna stick the dog in the dishwasher.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.427
Hey.

00:37.504 --> 00:40.098
Come on, now, quit it.

00:42.142 --> 00:45.270
This is what we dreamed about.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.779
What we prayed for.

00:47.847 --> 00:50.247
l know. l'm sorry.

00:51.351 --> 00:55.754
- l just can't stop wondering why.
- Hm?

00:55.822 --> 00:59.087
Why give up a child? Give it up to strangers?

00:59.159 --> 01:01.957
God has his reason and his ways.

01:23.216 --> 01:26.208
Mr and Mrs Van De Kamp?

01:26.419 --> 01:27.818
Hi.

01:27.887 --> 01:30.447
This was so hard to find.

01:31.524 --> 01:35.551
l'm so sorry, but there's a page here
that didn't get signed.

01:35.795 --> 01:39.128
lf l can just get you to do that now?
Here we go.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.895
- Right there.
- Thanks.

01:42.902 --> 01:45.097
l keep asking myself a question.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.841
l know there's been a medical exam.

01:52.178 --> 01:54.476
But are you sure he's OK?

01:54.547 --> 01:59.246
- Now, honey...
- Well, why would the mother give him up?

01:59.319 --> 02:04.916
You should understand
this was a life choice by a single mother.

02:04.991 --> 02:08.256
And a terribly difficult decision for her.

02:08.328 --> 02:12.094
But l can say it was
only for the good of the child.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.980
l want you to meet William.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.070
William was a bullfrog

03:27.173 --> 03:30.199
Was a good friend of mine

03:31.311 --> 03:34.803
Never understood a single word he said

03:34.914 --> 03:38.350
But l helped him drink his wine

03:39.052 --> 03:42.385
And it must have been
some mighty fine wine

03:42.455 --> 03:45.549
Joy to the world

03:45.792 --> 03:48.784
All the boys and girls

03:48.861 --> 03:52.058
Joy to the fishes...

03:57.870 --> 04:00.065
ln the deep blue sea

04:00.139 --> 04:03.074
Joy to you and me

04:03.176 --> 04:06.475
lf l were the king of the world...

04:14.053 --> 04:16.521
1,492.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.185
1,493.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.064
20.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.936
They don't pay me enough.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.361
Right there! Hands in the air!

06:11.437 --> 06:14.304
Turn around and step forward.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.973
Step forward!

06:20.847 --> 06:24.339
Let's go, tough guy. All the way down.

06:44.837 --> 06:47.203
Agent Reyes.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.400
Agent Scully.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.170
Do we know who he is?

06:51.244 --> 06:55.078
He says his name is Miller,
but he has no identification on him.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.015
Beyond that we don't know a lot.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.186
Why are the lights off?

07:02.255 --> 07:05.713
- He wouldn't speak with them on.
- What do you mean?

07:06.692 --> 07:10.753
lf you saw him in the light you'd understand.
Something's wrong with his face.

07:10.830 --> 07:15.961
lt's been severely burned,
by fire or maybe acid.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.807
And he says he knows me?

07:21.874 --> 07:24.104
And that he's afraid.

07:24.177 --> 07:28.011
A victim of what he calls the alien conspiracy.

07:34.987 --> 07:38.013
You won't talk to me.
You gonna talk to her, Mr Miller?

07:38.090 --> 07:40.786
lf she'll help me and protect me.

07:40.860 --> 07:44.887
Better hope she's feeling
more charitable than l am, partner.

07:44.964 --> 07:49.697
Agent Scully, he's under arrest
for assaulting a federal officer.

07:49.769 --> 07:52.897
l explained the penalties
but he still refuses a lawyer.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.703
- How did he get in the building?
- We found a card key on him.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.210
He says it was given to him by Fox Mulder.

08:02.081 --> 08:06.347
- His name's Miller?
- Daniel Miller, of Fredericksburg.

08:06.419 --> 08:10.446
Gave us an address
but we're still working on the confirmation.

08:15.061 --> 08:19.828
- What are you doing here?
- l came here to find answers.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.663
- Answers to what?
- To this.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.760
What they did to me.

08:24.837 --> 08:28.238
From your scarring
it appears that you've been burned.

08:28.307 --> 08:33.768
Are you claiming someone burned you and
there is evidence here to incriminate them?

08:33.846 --> 08:39.751
According to Fox Mulder, the men who did
this are part of a government conspiracy.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.859
Go on.

08:50.796 --> 08:53.731
You know who these men are.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.529
Did Mulder tell you that too?

08:59.005 --> 09:00.438
When?

09:00.506 --> 09:04.943
lf l were to tell you that,
you might use the information to find him.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.309
Mulder doesn't wanna be found.

09:07.380 --> 09:12.977
When l searched him, l found those X-Files
stuffed inside his clothes.

09:17.757 --> 09:21.386
- You know who that is?
- lt's his sister.

09:21.460 --> 09:24.327
- Whose?
- Mulder's.

09:26.866 --> 09:30.893
She was abducted from her home
when she was a little girl.

09:31.837 --> 09:35.170
Part of this same government conspiracy.

09:36.909 --> 09:40.310
You seem to know a lot, Mr Miller.

09:40.379 --> 09:44.907
lt gives an impression either
that you are telling the truth

09:44.984 --> 09:47.646
or you just want us to believe that you are.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.622
lf l thought you'd believe me,
l wouldn't have snuck in here.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.830
Agent Doggett?

09:58.898 --> 10:04.302
Would you please arrange
the transfer of this man to Quantico?

10:05.237 --> 10:08.468
l'd like to personally examine his injuries.

10:32.865 --> 10:37.302
From the tissue quality,
your scarring is fairly recent.

10:37.370 --> 10:42.467
The extent of it is severe,
but it's not from burning or chemicals.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.839
No.

10:45.911 --> 10:48.243
What is it, then?

10:51.350 --> 10:53.682
Mr Miller?

10:55.521 --> 10:57.716
l was injected.

11:03.562 --> 11:06.429
lnjected with what?

11:09.535 --> 11:12.197
l don't know. lt burned.

11:13.639 --> 11:17.871
Throughout my whole body, inside and out.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.624
Agent Scully? Agent Reyes?

11:33.693 --> 11:36.184
l need to speak to you.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.433
What is it, Agent Doggett?

11:49.508 --> 11:52.477
l've been out runnin'
this man's supposed lD.

11:52.545 --> 11:57.608
There are seven Daniel Millers
in Fredericksburg. But he isn't one of 'em.

11:57.683 --> 12:00.015
Well, then, who is he?

12:00.086 --> 12:02.850
l got an idea.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.413
But you're not gonna believe it.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.252
Well, who is he?

12:09.395 --> 12:13.161
You asked him how he got in the FBl,
how he knows what he knows?

12:13.232 --> 12:16.565
He said he contacted Agent Mulder,
that Mulder told him...

12:16.635 --> 12:19.968
l don't think so. l don't think
Mulder told him anything.

12:20.039 --> 12:23.907
l think that how he got in here
and the reason he knows what he knows

12:23.976 --> 12:27.673
is because that man in there is Mulder.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.150
That's ridiculous.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.721
- lt's absurd.
- ls it?

12:46.432 --> 12:49.196
What is true and what we want to be true

12:50.002 --> 12:52.698
aren't always the same.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.935
l'm telling you, that's not Mulder.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.979
l hope you prove me wrong.

13:37.016 --> 13:40.417
Open your mouth, sir.
l need to look at your dental work.

13:40.486 --> 13:45.082
You're not gonna tell me
l need braces, are you?

13:56.268 --> 13:58.361
Now your eyes.

14:00.105 --> 14:02.300
Are you going to help me?

14:04.777 --> 14:07.746
l don't know how l can.

14:08.113 --> 14:11.412
Help me make them pay for this.

14:13.018 --> 14:18.285
You refer to them as if l know them,
or know where they are.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.725
They did terrible things to you, too,

14:22.795 --> 14:25.593
when you were abducted.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.171
Sir, you've given us a false name.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.902
We know that your name is not Daniel Miller.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.071
No, it's not.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.278
What is it?

14:45.351 --> 14:47.615
l can't say.

14:51.156 --> 14:54.182
Well, why lie to us if you want us to help you?

14:54.760 --> 15:01.029
There are people here at the FBl who would
kill me if they knew l was being held here.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.563
The same people who would kill Mulder.

15:18.117 --> 15:22.816
- You can put your clothes back on now.
- l'm asking for your help.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.450
But l might be able to help you.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.526
How can you help me?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.793
You're looking for answers too.

15:35.567 --> 15:38.331
We're both looking for answers.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.352
lt's not him.

16:02.361 --> 16:05.489
- lt's not Mulder.
- You're absolutely sure of that?

16:05.564 --> 16:06.826
Yes.

16:06.899 --> 16:11.097
And so will we all be
once you bring me back his DNA test.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.432
What do we do with him now?

16:14.506 --> 16:18.533
Admittedly he's lying about who he is,
but the danger to him may be real.

16:18.610 --> 16:22.546
We need to figure out what he wants,
then see if he lies about that too.

16:22.614 --> 16:28.348
- How are we gonna do that?
- First we need to quietly get him back to DC.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.149
To FBl headquarters.

16:46.739 --> 16:52.541
You came here looking for something.
What is it that you hoped to find?

16:54.046 --> 16:56.742
l didn't find it.

16:57.616 --> 17:02.315
You stole several files pertaining
to the 1973 abduction of Mulder's sister.

17:02.388 --> 17:06.118
But yet you say there's danger
to your life right now.

17:06.258 --> 17:10.251
The conspiracy to keep the truth about aliens
from the American public,

17:10.329 --> 17:12.490
all but destroyed a few years ago,

17:12.564 --> 17:15.931
has given rise to a new conspiracy
in the government now,

17:16.001 --> 17:18.799
by men who are alien themselves.

17:21.673 --> 17:24.164
And what does this have to do with you?

17:24.242 --> 17:26.803
What you can see they did to me

17:26.878 --> 17:30.645
was a failed attempt to turn me
into one of these alien men.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.583
l was a guinea pig, a test subject.

17:35.621 --> 17:39.614
And now l want to expose their evil plans.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.682
What plans are those?

17:45.931 --> 17:48.161
To do this to you.

17:49.935 --> 17:51.926
To everyone.

17:52.971 --> 17:56.065
Mulder said there were files here.

17:56.141 --> 18:01.408
Cases like mine. He gave me case numbers
but l don't see them. They're not here.

18:02.981 --> 18:06.007
Someone's already removed them.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.110
Yes.

18:08.887 --> 18:10.946
Who?

18:26.472 --> 18:29.373
This is what you're looking for.

18:30.809 --> 18:33.243
You trust me.

18:35.147 --> 18:37.081
Thank you.

18:54.867 --> 18:58.064
- What are you doing?
- Proving Agent Doggett wrong,

18:58.137 --> 19:00.298
that that's not Mulder in there.

19:00.372 --> 19:02.431
How? l don't understand.

19:02.708 --> 19:06.166
Mulder and l agreed
to take those files out of the office

19:06.245 --> 19:08.406
and leave them here for safekeeping.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.644
Mulder would have known where they were,
and that man in there didn't.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.065
- What are you doing? Get away from the crib!
- He was crying.

19:32.137 --> 19:34.264
lt's none of your business.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.307
l'm sorry.

19:37.276 --> 19:42.009
l'd heard so much about William.
Mulder told me how he missed him.

19:45.384 --> 19:49.411
Well, if that's true, then where the hell is he?

19:51.957 --> 19:54.255
- Tell me where he is!
- You don't wanna know.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.886
l have to know!

19:56.962 --> 19:59.988
- He's in pain. Terrible pain.
- Then let me go to him.

20:00.065 --> 20:03.228
- There's nothing you can do.
- That's not for you to decide.

20:03.302 --> 20:09.138
You know as well as l that it's Mulder's
decision. He begged me to honor it.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.739
For your safety, and William's.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.947
Here, Dana, let me take him for you.

20:18.016 --> 20:19.210
No.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.248
Please.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.754
May l?

20:25.924 --> 20:28.620
l wanna hold him.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.661
- Mr Miller...
- No, it's important l do this.

20:35.701 --> 20:38.966
l want to hold him, for Mulder.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.145
He's so beautiful.

21:39.598 --> 21:43.261
Assistant Director.
You said you'd spoken to the lab?

21:43.335 --> 21:47.362
- l got info on the exam Scully performed.
- What?

21:47.439 --> 21:51.899
The blood type matches Mulder's,
but aspects of the physiology don't match.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.638
Such as?

21:53.712 --> 21:58.615
The body mass, of course. He's shorter and
weighs considerably less than Mulder did.

21:58.684 --> 22:02.450
You haven't seen this guy,
what they've done to him.

22:02.521 --> 22:06.617
The way he's twisted, he's like an old man.
He could be 100 years old.

22:06.692 --> 22:10.753
l'm just relaying the facts.
And the fact is, he's not 100 years old, is he?

22:10.829 --> 22:13.423
Not the way he attacked you.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.832
Whoever he is, he wants something.

22:16.902 --> 22:19.996
He wants revenge
against the people that burned him.

22:20.072 --> 22:23.803
And Mulder told him where he could find
the files and the people who did it.

22:23.875 --> 22:29.370
That makes no sense. Mulder knows those
files inside out. Why notjust tell him?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.086
Skinner.

22:36.988 --> 22:38.751
Yeah.

22:38.824 --> 22:41.418
You're sure about that?

22:42.761 --> 22:45.161
Right.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.500
What?

22:55.807 --> 22:58.640
That was the lab.

22:58.710 --> 23:03.079
They were able to rush the PCR test and
they came up with a definitive DNA result.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.241
What is it?

23:06.852 --> 23:09.286
Where is this man right now?

23:25.237 --> 23:27.967
lt's all been a good act.

23:30.976 --> 23:33.410
l don't know what you mean.

23:34.479 --> 23:36.413
l think you do.

23:42.687 --> 23:45.952
You knew those files were here.

23:46.024 --> 23:49.425
You pretended not to
so l'd bring you here to see William.

23:49.494 --> 23:50.927
No.

23:51.029 --> 23:53.691
- l want the truth from you.
- What truth?

23:53.765 --> 23:57.201
- The truth that you won't speak.
- l want the same truth you do.

23:57.269 --> 24:01.262
- Don't do this to me. Not you.
- l didn't come here to upset you.

24:01.339 --> 24:04.035
l didn't plan on being caught.

24:05.110 --> 24:09.843
l know you have a hard life - raising a son,
not knowing if you'll see Mulder again.

24:09.915 --> 24:13.544
- How do you know my life?
- l know what Mulder knows.

24:13.618 --> 24:19.784
l know they used you to create the child, and
they continue to use you to take care of it.

24:20.392 --> 24:23.327
- What are you saying?
- You know what l'm saying.

24:23.395 --> 24:26.831
Your son, your child, is part alien.

24:28.233 --> 24:31.361
Just tell me who you are.

24:33.338 --> 24:35.568
Come on. Just say your name.

24:37.242 --> 24:39.005
Say it!

24:39.077 --> 24:41.136
Just say it!

24:42.347 --> 24:46.147
- Agent Scully...
- Could you please leave? And close the door.

24:47.118 --> 24:50.246
- Step out, please.
- This was a private conversation.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.155
l understand. l'm sorry.

24:54.192 --> 24:57.252
- Do you know who that man is?
- Yes, l do.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.025
Agent Scully.

25:00.098 --> 25:02.828
What is this? What?

25:02.901 --> 25:06.098
We got DNA results. Positive lD.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.066
lt's not him.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.909
He wouldn't say these things.

25:12.978 --> 25:15.310
DNA's a match to Fox Mulder's.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.717
lt's not him.

25:44.509 --> 25:47.000
Can we get you anything?

25:48.113 --> 25:50.206
No, thank you.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.916
l just need a minute.

26:09.534 --> 26:12.697
- Where'd he go?
- l don't know.

26:12.771 --> 26:15.467
l'll go check the nursery.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.475
Monica! Stay with Scully!

26:31.823 --> 26:33.518
Hey!

27:21.206 --> 27:25.836
No more running, Mulder.
We're gonna protect you now.

27:31.783 --> 27:34.149
Give him some time.

27:37.389 --> 27:41.325
- You're gonna live, buddy.
- Think that's gonna scar?

27:43.061 --> 27:46.861
We're gonna talk,
but first you're gonna get some sleep.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.733
So what now?

28:25.770 --> 28:28.170
What do you mean?

28:28.239 --> 28:30.673
What do you wanna do?

28:30.742 --> 28:33.336
Keep it a secret, for starters.

28:33.445 --> 28:36.209
That's not gonna be hard.

28:37.482 --> 28:40.679
Nobody's ever gonna believe
that that's Mulder.

28:40.752 --> 28:42.777
Somebody did this to him.

28:42.854 --> 28:47.882
Whoever that is is gonna know it's him.
That's what he's afraid of.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.054
lf he's so afraid then why did he run?

28:53.765 --> 28:56.563
You still don't believe it's him.

28:56.634 --> 28:59.603
You know a person in so many ways.

29:01.639 --> 29:04.802
Ways that a test can't even begin to know.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.708
l'll be happy to run his DNA again for you.

29:08.780 --> 29:14.241
But l don't have to tell you what a long shot
it is. l mean, it came up a perfect match.

29:14.319 --> 29:17.152
You ask why he'd run.

29:17.222 --> 29:22.091
Stop and think how hard this is for him,
the way he looks.

29:25.296 --> 29:27.594
lf that was Mulder,

29:27.665 --> 29:29.656
l wouldn't care.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.866
But he cares.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.805
He has to.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.867
Maybe he's ashamed.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.037
Of what?

29:43.715 --> 29:49.676
Notjust the way he looks. You let him go to
protect him, only he couldn't protect himself.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.816
You believe that?

29:55.860 --> 29:57.760
l don't know.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.090
We'll have a better sense when he wakes up.

32:32.250 --> 32:35.219
- lt's OK.
- ls he OK?

32:42.126 --> 32:45.186
Oh, my God, there's blood! Oh, my God.

32:47.165 --> 32:51.659
- There's blood on the sheets.
- What'd he do to him? What'd he do to him?

32:55.907 --> 32:58.137
- Where's Dr Edwards?
- l'm Dr Newman.

32:58.209 --> 33:02.703
- He's been injected with something.
- We're takin' him straight to Trauma.

33:04.015 --> 33:06.210
Airways are open. Lungs are clear.

33:06.284 --> 33:11.415
- Heart rate slightly elevated. Skin is warm.
- l spoke to a woman, a Dr Edwards.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.980
- l'm Whitney Edwards.
- This is Dana Scully.

33:14.058 --> 33:17.289
- Any idea what he was injected with?
- l don't know.

33:17.362 --> 33:20.593
- We're gonna run tests...
- l'm a medical doctor. Can l...?

33:20.665 --> 33:26.399
Then you know what this is all about. You
just need to sit tight and let us do ourjob.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.943
What'd you do to him? What'd you do?

33:43.221 --> 33:45.587
Where'd you put it?

33:56.567 --> 33:59.661
ls this it? ls this what you used?

33:59.737 --> 34:02.171
- Answer me!
- Yes.

34:04.842 --> 34:11.475
Anything happens to that kid, l'll take you out
personally. l don't care who the hell you are.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.864
Here she comes.

34:38.643 --> 34:42.476
- How is he? ls he all right?
- He's good. He's doing fine.

34:42.547 --> 34:45.516
- Oh, God.
- Can she see him?

34:45.583 --> 34:50.646
We have him in Stepdown as a precaution.
But l think he'll be going home in no time.

34:50.721 --> 34:53.952
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.361
You found nothing?
There has to be something.

34:58.429 --> 35:03.833
There's some bruising on the head
where something broke the skin, but he's fine.

35:03.901 --> 35:07.928
- What about a tox screen?
- There's a lot of iron in his blood.

35:08.005 --> 35:10.906
Other than that,
your son is completely normal.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.608
That doesn't make sense.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.409
No.

35:18.416 --> 35:20.782
l think it does.

35:21.853 --> 35:25.118
lt makes perfect sense now.

35:36.567 --> 35:41.971
l've seen my share of the hideous,
of the disgusting and the repellent.

35:42.039 --> 35:47.272
But you, sir, are
the most perfect expression l will ever see

35:47.345 --> 35:51.008
of all that is vile and hateful in life.

35:51.082 --> 35:55.348
That may well be.
But for a moment you believed it.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.421
That l was him.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.889
l never believed it.

36:02.059 --> 36:04.789
You wanted to believe.

36:07.298 --> 36:10.961
You are as false as your face.

36:11.035 --> 36:16.268
l bet you wish night and day that that bullet
that was meant to kill you had succeeded.

36:18.743 --> 36:21.337
l don't believe this.

36:23.481 --> 36:26.848
- What?
- Who this is.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.079
You're wrong about that.

36:30.922 --> 36:36.360
When l look in the mirror l see something
much different than the world sees.

36:36.427 --> 36:42.525
He could destroy my face and my dignity
when he shot me in that office.

36:51.842 --> 36:55.835
But he couldn't destroy
the one thing l love most.

36:57.014 --> 36:59.778
My hatred of him.

37:00.851 --> 37:04.685
Your cigarette-smoking
son of a bitch of a father.

37:04.755 --> 37:07.315
And Mulder's.

37:07.458 --> 37:10.291
You counted on the DNA.

37:10.361 --> 37:14.354
That we'd buy it without question
and not look any further.

37:14.432 --> 37:17.993
DNA is what Mulder shared
with Jeffrey Spender.

37:28.079 --> 37:31.242
Half-brothers, raised apart.

37:31.315 --> 37:34.807
That's about all that Mulder and l ever shared.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.986
You haven't seen Mulder, have you?

37:41.058 --> 37:44.323
You haven't even talked to him.

37:46.931 --> 37:53.029
So getting caught at the FBl,
winning our trust, was all towards one thing.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.697
lt was only to get to William.

38:00.011 --> 38:05.972
Sitting here, you'd wish me dead.
Shortly l'll do you the favor.

38:06.050 --> 38:08.575
l had this checked.

38:10.921 --> 38:15.085
lt's an unknown metal
that you injected into my son.

38:16.994 --> 38:19.224
lt's a form of magnetite.

38:21.432 --> 38:23.127
A gift.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.532
''A gift''?

38:26.437 --> 38:29.964
Having failed as a conspirator
to control alien colonization,

38:30.041 --> 38:35.001
my father wanted nothing more
than to see the world fail too.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.310
So, what, you've prevented it now?

38:40.384 --> 38:45.549
You've prevented alien colonization
by injecting this metal into my son?

38:45.623 --> 38:48.922
Your son is the one thing the aliens need.

38:50.328 --> 38:54.890
l took revenge on my father
by taking William away from them.

38:55.933 --> 38:58.595
So he's all right now?

38:59.437 --> 39:02.031
l mean, just like that?

39:05.609 --> 39:07.702
So it's over?

39:09.714 --> 39:12.444
They'll let him be?

39:12.516 --> 39:15.007
lt'll never be over.

39:16.087 --> 39:21.719
They'll always know what he was.
They'll never accept what he is.

39:26.063 --> 39:30.500
- Well, l can protect him.
- And if you can't?

39:33.237 --> 39:35.637
Look at me.

39:37.508 --> 39:40.375
What they did.

39:43.514 --> 39:46.915
ls this what you want for your son?

40:03.768 --> 40:05.668
Dana?

40:06.704 --> 40:13.007
The room's all fresh for you. l threw out all
the old bedding and bought new stuff, OK?

40:13.778 --> 40:15.837
Thank you.

40:18.315 --> 40:22.513
l know it's impossible
to stop thinking about what he said.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.487
About William.

40:25.556 --> 40:28.457
But it's all lies, Dana.

40:28.526 --> 40:31.620
And you were the one who proved it.

40:31.695 --> 40:35.187
And how should l prove it now?

40:35.266 --> 40:38.793
By insisting that l can protect him?

40:41.639 --> 40:44.039
Only to learn too late that l can't?

40:47.478 --> 40:50.538
You say it as if you have a choice.

40:51.482 --> 40:54.679
He didn't have a choice to come into this life.

40:57.087 --> 41:00.921
l don't have a choice about what he is or was.

41:04.895 --> 41:09.594
But l do have a choice
about the life my son will have.

41:12.303 --> 41:18.367
And shouldn't l choose that he never
have to be afraid of anyone or anything?

41:22.146 --> 41:25.980
And can l ever really even promise him that?

41:29.587 --> 41:32.112
But who can?

42:49.300 --> 42:51.791
Sweet dreams, baby boy.

43:51.629 --> 43:55.030
