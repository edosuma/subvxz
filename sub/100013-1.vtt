new people.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.400
SHONA: Vish reckons he makes
200 quid a day out there.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.640
‐ Who?

09:21.640 --> 09:23.440
‐ Who?
Homeless guy.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.760
Don't eat that fruit salad.
It's Vish's breakfast.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.920
God, Vish is driving me
nuts right now.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.880
He just keeps alluding
to moving in, you know?
But in a sneaky way.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.240
Like, he makes
his sourdough here.

in his house, you know?

that he'd want you to live

09:46.480 --> 09:48.200
in his mah‐ssive house
rent‐free.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.560

if I move in, then what next?

09:51.560 --> 09:54.120
We either break up
or get married.

get married

10:05.040 --> 10:06.560

on the day to be real.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.000

in marriage

as well tell me now.

I can't get married

isn't it?

with you.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.920
Can I pop it?
‐ No, you cannot pop it.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.000
‐ No, I don't want to, but what
if someone sees your back

11:27.000 --> 11:28.440
tonight and vomits?

11:28.440 --> 11:30.360
‐ Oh, Jesus. Okay, then.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.200
Ow! Fucking hell!
‐ Oh! Oh, God, sorry.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.680
That's disgusting.
