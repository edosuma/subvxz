00:05.739 --> 00:08.541
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>

<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:08.575 --> 00:11.544
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:11.578 --> 00:14.280

01:19.279 --> 01:22.682
 Hey, Screech, l thought l knew
 every hiding
 place in this school.

01:22.716 --> 01:23.883
 How did you find it?

01:23.917 --> 01:26.720
  A bully dumped me down
  the garbage chute.

01:28.321 --> 01:31.224
   Some day I'm gonna
   get even with that girl.

01:33.159 --> 01:37.263
  Wow! Look at these posters.
  Hey,
  we got The Rolling Stones.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.765
  Hey, Jimi Hendrix.

01:38.798 --> 01:42.402
 Who are the three guys
 with Paul McCartney?

01:42.435 --> 01:45.572
  That's The Beatles,
  you idiot.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.873
   Paul never
   would've made it

01:46.906 --> 01:49.809
   if he would've stuck
   with those wimps.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.345
  I wonder what's under here.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.348
  Wow, look at this!

01:57.317 --> 02:01.821
 "KKTY-FM,
 home of Tiger Radio"?

02:01.855 --> 02:04.858
 Screech, Bayside
 has a radio station.

02:04.891 --> 02:06.326
 Wow!

02:08.728 --> 02:11.598
 Look at that.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.866
 Hey!

02:16.302 --> 02:18.638
   Hey there, it's time
   to rock and roll

02:18.672 --> 02:20.340
   with your main music man
   Zack Morris,

02:20.373 --> 02:23.276
here on KKTY, Bayside!

02:23.309 --> 02:24.744
 Cool!

02:25.945 --> 02:27.881
 I wonder if this thing
 still works.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.617
 Well, there's only one way
 to find out.

02:36.222 --> 02:39.492
 Woman:
<i>KKTY, Bayside!</i>

02:48.868 --> 02:51.871
   I think it works.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.941
 Mr. Belding, is it true that
 Bayside had a radio station?

02:54.974 --> 02:59.112
 Absolutely. KKTY was the voice
 of Bayside in the '60s.

02:59.112 --> 03:01.848
It was one smoking
music machine.

03:01.881 --> 03:03.483
Well, who ran it, sir?

03:03.516 --> 03:06.786
   The hippest, hottest,
   most rad DJ ever.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.527
 Oh, wow.
 Hey,
 wasn't that a happening tune?

03:14.561 --> 03:15.829
  I'm The Big Bopper,

03:15.862 --> 03:18.698
 and you beautiful people
 are groovin' to KKTY,

03:18.732 --> 03:22.736
 the most out of sight station
 in the nation. Can you dig it?

03:22.769 --> 03:25.872
  Woman:
 <i>KKTY, Tigers!</i>

03:25.905 --> 03:28.942
   - Now groove to this groove.
   - ( music plays )

03:31.978 --> 03:35.749
 Man: <i>Richard Belding,</i>
<i>this is the principal.</i>

03:35.782 --> 03:37.817
  <i>Report to my</i>
  <i>office immediately.</i>

03:37.851 --> 03:40.787
  Man, what does
  that jerk want now?

03:45.492 --> 03:49.329
  - You were The Big Bopper?
  - I was The Master Blaster!

03:49.362 --> 03:50.597
   The Boss.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.532
 I thought Springsteen
 was The Boss.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.635
   Nah, he stole it from me.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.638
 Sir, we'd like to put
 KKTY back on the air.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.374
 - What?
 - We... would... like... to...

04:01.408 --> 04:05.712
   I heard you!
   The answer is no.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.314
 - Why not?
 - It's just not a good idea.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.783
 Trust me on this one.

04:09.816 --> 04:13.053
 But, Mr. Belding, just think
 how it'd help school spirit.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.488
 It'd give us something
 to listen to besides teachers.

04:16.523 --> 04:21.861
And you could give us
the benefit of your vast
knowledge of, um...

04:21.894 --> 04:23.863
 "radioisms."
 Ahem.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.067
 "Radioisms"?

04:27.067 --> 04:30.503
  Hey, l don't see you
  sucking up.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.340
   Sir, let us follow
   in your footsteps

04:33.373 --> 04:35.575
and learn from
The Big Bopper.

04:35.608 --> 04:39.512
   - Well...
   - All: Bopper,
   Bopper, Bopper...

04:41.414 --> 04:45.618
 All right,
 all right, all right...
 but on one condition.

04:45.652 --> 04:49.089
 I have the final say
 about what goes
 out on the air. Huh?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.658
 All right.
 Now, you were saying?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.994
   Bopper, Bopper...

04:55.095 --> 04:58.932
 All: Bopper, Bopper, Bopper...

04:58.965 --> 05:01.434
  Okay, troops,
  everyone's got
  their assignments.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.670
  It looks like Tiger Radio
  is ready to roar!

05:03.703 --> 05:05.772
 No, wait,
 not so fast, Preppie.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.041
 You've given everyone
 a job but me.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.477
   - What do you want to do?
   - Sports.

05:10.510 --> 05:14.047
 What are you gonna do,
 wrestle on the radio?

05:14.047 --> 05:17.050
  - No, l want to be
  a sportscaster.
  - Well, l didn't know that.

05:17.083 --> 05:20.754
  Sure.
  When l watch the games on TV,
  l turn down the sound,

05:20.787 --> 05:22.622
   and do the play-by-play.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.691
   All right, Slater.
   If you want it,
   hey, you got it.

05:24.724 --> 05:25.759
   All right. Great.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.628
I'm gonna be the most
talked about guy
on Tiger Radio.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.630
   You'll see, man.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.802
 Great trick, Max,
 you shrunk the food.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.804
Now can we have
our real orders?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.839
 Sorry, these are
 your real orders.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.976
   My costs have gone sky high,
   and l had to cut back.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.779
  - Sorry, Max, l didn't know.
  - That's terrible.

05:45.812 --> 05:47.914
   Thanks for understanding.

05:47.947 --> 05:49.649
Hey, good luck
with the radio station.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.618
  - I'm sure
  you'll all be great.
  - Zack: Thanks, Max.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.420
Thanks.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.121
 I haven't seen Max
 that depressed since the time

05:55.155 --> 05:58.224
 he made his dog disappear,
 and forgot how to
 bring Fluffy back.

05:58.258 --> 06:01.695
 I know. I wonder whatever
 happened to that dog?

06:06.099 --> 06:07.467
 What?

06:07.500 --> 06:11.037
   Goo-ood morning, Bayside,

06:11.037 --> 06:14.074
  hey and all you kids cutting
  school in the Palisades
  and at the beach,

06:14.107 --> 06:16.543
this is Wolfman Zack...

06:16.576 --> 06:20.447
  ( howling )

06:20.480 --> 06:22.949
 Hey, it's Bayside's freshest,
 hottest, hippest new station,

06:23.049 --> 06:26.186
 KKTY-FM, Tiger Radio!

06:26.219 --> 06:28.521
   ( roars )

06:28.555 --> 06:32.058
Bad food hits Bayside,
students hit bathrooms.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.828
This is Jessie Spano
for KKTY News.

06:34.861 --> 06:37.897
   I caught up with Mr. Belding
   running out of
   the cafeteria today,

06:37.931 --> 06:42.068
  and he assured
  me that green meat
  would no longer be served.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.903
Hi, this is Lisa,
your Galloping Gossip,

06:43.937 --> 06:47.507
 with everything
 you want to know
 that's none of your business.

06:47.540 --> 06:51.077
Flash! Debbie DeMarco's
new curves came with
Debbie's new sweater.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.080
 Hello, this is Kelly Desire.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.784
   It's evening, the candles
   are lit and you're with
   the one you love.

06:57.817 --> 07:01.554
 All that's missing
 is that special romantic song.

07:03.189 --> 07:07.660
  ( heavy metal music plays )

07:07.694 --> 07:12.465
   Thunder and
   lightning raged outside
   the old Victorian house.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.568
  There was a scream...
  ( screams )

07:15.602 --> 07:18.505
   Evelyn's heart pounded...

07:20.740 --> 07:23.243
   as she slowly opened
   the bedroom door.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.845
  ( creaking sound )

07:25.879 --> 07:30.050
 She saw an axe
 and recognized the face of...

07:30.050 --> 07:31.618
That's all
the time we have today.

07:31.651 --> 07:34.788
  Tune in tomorrow for another
  exciting installment of...

07:34.821 --> 07:38.258
  Screech's Mystery Theatre.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.293
 And now, look alive,
 sports fans,

07:40.326 --> 07:43.630
  'cause on deck
  it's Tiger Radio's
  sportiest reporter,

07:43.663 --> 07:46.299
  AC Slater.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.069
   ( up-tempo music playing )

07:53.673 --> 07:55.809
( music ends )

07:55.842 --> 07:58.545
 Hey, thanks, Wolfman.

07:58.578 --> 08:01.014
   Okay, first things first.

08:01.047 --> 08:04.718
   Let's check out
   the old scoreboard, huh?

08:04.751 --> 08:08.755
   I mean, hey, gimme a break,
   it's not that old, right?

08:08.788 --> 08:11.224
( horn honks )

08:11.257 --> 08:15.195
 Anyway, in local
 high school action it was...

08:16.629 --> 08:20.033
 it was, Bayside 5, Valley 4.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.036
 I guess that means we won,
 right math majors?

08:23.069 --> 08:24.771
  ( honking )

08:25.505 --> 08:28.174
  This is AC Slater.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.277
And just remember, fans,
in the airport of life,

08:31.311 --> 08:34.313
  sports is just the baggage.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.783
   - Think about it.
   - ( honks )

08:38.751 --> 08:41.921
   ( up-tempo music plays )

08:41.955 --> 08:43.323
 - All right.
 - ( pop music plays )

08:43.356 --> 08:45.959
 So what do you think?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.961
   We're thinking about it.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.830
See, Preppie.
I told you l was good.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.669
Hey, guys, l think l know
what would help Slater.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.737
  - Girls: What?
  - A muzzle.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.346
 How can we without
 hurting his feelings?

09:06.379 --> 09:09.182
   Why don't we just wave
   a skunk in front of him?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.618
 You know, Screech,
 for once you have a good idea.

09:11.651 --> 09:14.554
We can't do that.
This is Slater's dream.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.222
 Maybe we're being overcritical

09:16.256 --> 09:17.757
because we expected him
to be better.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.760
I bet the average listener
thinks he's just fine.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.363
Excuse me, what do you guys
think of Tiger Radio?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.298
 - Radical!
 - Really cool!

09:25.331 --> 09:26.766
The best, man!

09:26.800 --> 09:29.769
  And, what do you think of our
  sports reporter, AC Slater?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.604
  - Awful!
  - The worst!

09:31.638 --> 09:34.741
   Someone should wave
   a skunk in front of him.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.711
 See?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.779
  That's it.
  We've got to
  get rid of Slater.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.183
 - Why do we have
 to get rid of him?
 - Yeah, why don't we help him?

09:43.216 --> 09:46.219
Hey, good idea.
We'll staple his lips.

09:48.488 --> 09:51.925
 And so,
 Slater, the less you say,
 the more impact you'll have.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.527
 - You really think so?
 - Hey, l wrote
 the copy for you.

09:54.561 --> 09:57.063
 I mean, you're our top draw.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.566
 We want to leave them
 wanting more.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.668
   I don't know.
   I'm not so sure, Preppie.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.269
 Well, according
 to our latest survey,

10:03.303 --> 10:06.439
 98% of our listeners
 want it short, fast and often.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.309
  Yeah? What do
  the other 2% want?

10:09.342 --> 10:11.745
   A date with Paula Abdul.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.480
Hey, with sizzling
copy like this,

10:13.513 --> 10:15.849
you're headed for
the Radio Hall of Fame.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.718
  "This is AC Slater.

10:18.752 --> 10:22.989
  Today's scores
  are 3-0, 6-1, 10-2.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.791
  Thank you."

10:24.824 --> 10:26.292
  That's it?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.395
  Hey, it's sharp, it's snappy,
  it's bold.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.963
  - Slater, it's you!
  - Yeah.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.332
 When did you say I'll be on?

10:32.932 --> 10:34.668
 Every chance we get.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.636
  You'd be looking at
  twice the airtime!

10:36.670 --> 10:38.738
   Now that l like.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.640
 10-2.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.443
  10-2. 2-10.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.712
  All right.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.414
   Do you think we're doing
   the right thing?

10:47.447 --> 10:49.783
   Hey, is Belding balding?

10:50.917 --> 10:52.352
  Zack, Zack.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.920
   I was
   researching a news story,

10:53.953 --> 10:56.990
 and l found out
 that the Bayside
 School District owns The Max!

10:57.023 --> 10:59.059
   - You're kidding.
   - No.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.062
   And if Max doesn't come up
   with $10,000 in back
   rent by next week,

11:02.062 --> 11:05.331
  our favorite hangout
  will be turned
  into a parking lot!

11:05.365 --> 11:09.069
  - We can't let this happen.
  - But what can we do?

11:11.304 --> 11:14.341
  I think it's time we used
  the power of the airwaves.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.608
 - Let's do it.
 - All right.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.843
   Zack: All right.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.546
Here we go.
Ready, Jessie?

11:20.780 --> 11:23.583
 This is Jessie Spano
 with a Tiger Radio news flash.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.752
It looks like the end
of a student tradition

11:25.785 --> 11:28.321
  if the greedy, deceitful,
  irresponsible

11:28.355 --> 11:30.557
 Bayside School Board
 has its way.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.427
"Greedy"? "Deceitful"?

11:34.461 --> 11:36.463
 Don't forget "irresponsible."

11:36.496 --> 11:38.898
  No, you guys
  are irresponsible!

11:38.932 --> 11:41.368
 We have an obligation
 to report the truth.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.971
   Truth?
   You and Pinocchio Morris?

11:45.005 --> 11:47.907
 The truth is,
 that every member
 of the school board has called

11:47.941 --> 11:51.111
  threatening to have me fired.
  Is that what you want?

11:51.144 --> 11:52.879
Well...

11:53.613 --> 11:55.015
But what about The Max?

11:55.115 --> 11:56.850
  Should we just sit back
  and watch it be demolished?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.985
Better than my career.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.156
   Mr. Belding, The Max
   is very important to us.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.558
   - Can't you help?
   - I wish l could,

12:05.592 --> 12:07.794
   but the school board
   has made their decision,

12:07.827 --> 12:09.763
 and l am not going
 to stick my neck out

12:09.796 --> 12:12.432
 over this radio station again.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.067
Again?

12:14.067 --> 12:17.737
   Now drop the protest,
   and that's final.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.073
 Excuse me, but l have
 to go assure the school board

12:20.073 --> 12:22.409
  that this matter is closed.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.079
   Hold on, Jessie.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.981
 There's something
 he's not telling us.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.949
   - What do you think it is?
   - I don't know.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.619
   You're
   the investigative reporter.
   See what you can dig up.

12:32.652 --> 12:36.856
  - What are you gonna do?
  - I'm gonna play principal.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.760
 This is Mr. Belding.
 School's out!

12:40.794 --> 12:43.863
  - The school paper
  just reviewed us.
  - What did they say?

12:43.897 --> 12:45.865
   I don't know.
   I'm too nervous to look.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.467
   What if he didn't
   like my outfit?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.102
  We're on the radio,
  remember?

12:49.135 --> 12:50.837
   He can't see us.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.741
  Hey, look at this.

12:54.774 --> 12:59.145
 "Tiger Radio really cooks when
 Wolfman Zack is on the prowl."

12:59.179 --> 13:02.582
"Jessie Spano has
a nose for news,
and l smell a winner!"

13:02.615 --> 13:06.753
"Kelly Desire's voice
could heat your Jacuzzi.
The girl is H-O-T."

13:06.786 --> 13:09.055
"Lisa's Galloping Gossip
is off to a fast start.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.524
 She's funny, charming,
 and a great dresser."

13:11.558 --> 13:13.526
 See?

13:13.560 --> 13:14.928
   This guy really liked us.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.497
  Most of us.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.066
  "AC Slater stinks."

13:20.066 --> 13:23.069
   "Someone should wave
   a skunk in front of him"?

13:23.770 --> 13:25.572
 Poor Slater.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.108
 Hey, guys, what's up?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.576
  What are you doing?

13:29.609 --> 13:31.644
  Hey, guys, the station
  just got reviewed!

13:31.678 --> 13:33.813
 Really?
 Hey, what'd he say about me?

13:33.847 --> 13:35.582
  You stink!

13:37.550 --> 13:40.153
   Let me see that.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.856
  "AC Slater is boring, dull,

13:42.889 --> 13:46.092
  and should become a mime."

13:46.092 --> 13:49.863
 Hey, can you believe this guy?
 He thinks I'm no good.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.836
 So that's why
 you cut back my time.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.839
Look,
Slater, we just didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.508
   I'd rather get the truth
   from my friends

14:01.541 --> 14:05.045
   than read it
   in some stupid newspaper.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.479
I quit.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.424
   A peep hole
   in the girls locker room?

14:17.457 --> 14:20.660
   No. I found
   what Belding was hiding.

14:20.694 --> 14:24.431
  Look what's in this old
  school newspaper from 1968.

14:24.464 --> 14:28.468
 "D.J. Belding
 Moons School Board"?

14:28.501 --> 14:31.671
   "Picture on page
   three and four"?

14:33.540 --> 14:34.941
Let's see this.

14:34.974 --> 14:39.846
Whoa, now that's a side
of him I've never seen.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.083
  Apparently Mr. Belding
  was the Zack
  Morris of the '60s.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.719
 - ( knocking on door )
 - Come in.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.655
 ( chuckles )

14:49.823 --> 14:52.092
  Well, Morris,
  what did you do this time?

14:52.092 --> 14:53.893
Been doing
a little reading, sir.

14:53.927 --> 14:57.097
 You know, pages three and four
 are quite interesting.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.767
 Where'd you get that?

15:00.800 --> 15:04.070
   "Hippie Richie Belding was
   ordered to drop
   his on-air protest

15:04.104 --> 15:06.506
of the school ban
on jeans and long hair.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.509
   Belding dropped
   his bellbottoms instead.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.079
  The board responded
  by dropping station KKTY."

15:13.113 --> 15:16.516
   Okay, Morris,
   what do you want?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.084
   I want you to convince
   the school board

15:18.118 --> 15:19.652
  not to close down The Max.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.821
 Oh, I see.
 And if l don't, what,

15:21.855 --> 15:24.924
   you're gonna show
   the student body
   my student body?

15:24.958 --> 15:27.060
  Zack,
  if that picture gets out,
  it could ruin me.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.695
Is that what you want?

15:28.728 --> 15:32.198
 No,
 l just want you to remember
 what it was like to be a kid,

15:32.232 --> 15:35.201
   when you cared as much
   about jeans and long hair

15:35.235 --> 15:36.269
as we do about The Max.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.140
Zack,
that was a different time.
They are not the same.

15:40.173 --> 15:43.843
  No, sir, you're the one
  who's not the same.

15:43.877 --> 15:47.514
  I guess you forget what's
  more important
  when you get old.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.483
   You're not the guy
   I'm looking for.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.519
Here's the guy l need.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.458
 Zack Morris!

15:59.492 --> 16:00.760
 What?

16:04.230 --> 16:06.499
   Help me find the old me?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.570
 Welcome back, Bopper.

16:12.906 --> 16:15.041
( dance music playing )

16:25.552 --> 16:28.688
 Woman:
<i>KKTY, Bayside!</i>

16:28.722 --> 16:32.258
Welcome to the KKTY
Radiothon
broadcast from The Max

16:32.292 --> 16:33.360
   to save The Max!

16:34.527 --> 16:36.262
We've got music,
we've got dancing.
Now all we need is you

16:36.296 --> 16:38.965
 and $10,000 by noon tomorrow!

16:39.065 --> 16:41.868
 Now I'd like to introduce
 the man whose idea this was,

16:41.901 --> 16:44.604
The Big Bopper,
Richie Belding!

16:44.637 --> 16:46.172
 ( cheering )

16:47.807 --> 16:49.275
 Thanks, Wolfman Zack.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.745
 You know, as KKTY's
 first living legend,

16:51.778 --> 16:55.248
   I'd like to kick this off
   the way l used to kick
   off my old show.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.284
It's time for...
Bel-ba-ba-bel,
da-ding, da-ding, ding,

16:58.318 --> 17:01.721
 Bel-ba-ba-bel,
 da-ding, dong, ding, Belding!

17:04.924 --> 17:07.426
  Thank you, Bopper.

17:08.094 --> 17:09.529
   And now, for all the dirt

17:09.561 --> 17:11.731
 "The National Enquirer"
 hasn't found out yet,

17:11.765 --> 17:14.701
 here's Lisa,
 our Galloping Gossip!

17:17.837 --> 17:20.507
Hey, dudes, let's dish!

17:20.540 --> 17:23.510
 Okay, Bobby Tucker thinks he's
 going steady with
 Cindy Wasserman.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.578
  But what Bobby doesn't know
  is that Cindy has been seen

17:25.612 --> 17:27.247
  two nights this week
  with someone else.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.882
 Who?

17:28.915 --> 17:32.452
Hey, if you want
to know the trash,
you gotta pay the cash!

17:34.621 --> 17:37.457
   - ( phone rings )
   - Zack: All right!

17:39.793 --> 17:41.628
   Look who just dropped in.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.730
  It's the star
  of "Married With Children,"

17:43.763 --> 17:47.067
 my favorite
 TV lowlife Al Bundy.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.772
 Give me this.

17:52.806 --> 17:56.242
  It's an honor to be here
  to help you guys...

17:56.276 --> 17:58.611
save this dump.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.014
It's not a dump, Al,
it's a very nice place.

18:01.047 --> 18:04.250
What do I know about taste?
I married Peg.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.153
Hey...

18:07.187 --> 18:09.522
  All right.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.725
   Well, Jessie,
   what's our total so far?

18:11.758 --> 18:14.194
   The amount that people have
   pledged and donated is...

18:14.227 --> 18:19.199
  - $2,853.00.
  - All right.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.901
Keep those pledges coming.
Let's keep them coming.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.803
Here, this is for you.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.109
Hello?

18:29.142 --> 18:32.612
 - Hey, buddy.
 - I want to pledge my savings.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.681
 Put me down for $100.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.649
 Hey, thanks, Slater.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.251
 I'm sorry
 about what happened.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.720
 Why don't you come down?
 We can use your help.

18:40.754 --> 18:43.857
  Hey, you don't need me.
  I'll just ruin everything.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.300
   Well, Jessie,
   add another $100.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.770
   What's our total so far?

18:56.803 --> 18:59.205
  $8,1 34.00!

18:59.239 --> 19:01.808
 We are doing great,
 and we have
 the whole night ahead of us!

19:01.841 --> 19:04.577
  - All right!
  - ( crowd cheering )

19:19.626 --> 19:21.728
 Here's one
 of my favorite songs

19:21.761 --> 19:24.864
from late, great 1968!

19:24.898 --> 19:28.101
 ( rock music plays )

19:28.134 --> 19:30.070
 Mr. Belding,
 what are we gonna do?

19:30.103 --> 19:31.871
   The phones stopped
   ringing hours ago

19:31.905 --> 19:33.773
  and everybody's passed out.

19:33.807 --> 19:36.042
   Don't worry, Wolfman,
   the Big Bopper
   can go all night.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.178
 Just watch me bring it home.

19:42.148 --> 19:46.920
 ( hoarsely ) We
 desperately need
 your support to keep us going.

19:46.953 --> 19:50.056
  We only need 1,600 more...

19:50.090 --> 19:53.159
no, 1,700 more.

19:53.193 --> 19:56.896
Oh, we just need
more money now.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.833
   - ( music plays )
   - <i>Whoa, whoa,</i>
   <i>I need your money</i>

19:59.866 --> 20:01.935
   <i>I need your love</i>

20:01.968 --> 20:04.938
  <i>I need you, honey,</i>
  <i>when a push comes to shove</i>

20:04.971 --> 20:08.274
   - <i>I need...</i>
   - Hey, Preppie,
   Preppie, wake up.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.443
Here's my $100,

20:10.477 --> 20:13.279
 and an extra $25 from my dad.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.448
Thanks, Slater,
but we're still short,

20:15.482 --> 20:17.050
   and I can't talk anymore.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.285
   I don't think The Max
   is gonna make it.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.722
   We'll see about that.
   Give me this mic!

20:22.756 --> 20:24.991
 All right,
 everybody, listen up.

20:25.025 --> 20:28.395
 I'm AC Slater,
 and I've got something to say.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.130
   Zack: <i>Quiet down.</i>

20:30.163 --> 20:32.165
   - Quiet!
   - Shh, shh, shh...

20:32.198 --> 20:34.234
 Now look, l used
 to move around a lot.

20:34.267 --> 20:37.437
I never had a place l could
actually call home

20:37.470 --> 20:39.239
   until l came to Bayside.

20:39.272 --> 20:42.175
   Now, for the first time,

20:42.208 --> 20:44.277
 l have real friends,

20:44.310 --> 20:47.047
 and a cool place to hang out.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.082
  It's kind of
  like a second home.

20:49.115 --> 20:53.353
 Whenever I'm bummed,
there's always
 someone here to help.

20:53.386 --> 20:56.423
 Now l know it's late,
 and everyone's tired,

20:56.456 --> 20:59.826
  and the easy thing to do
  is to quit, right?

20:59.859 --> 21:03.063
 But, hey,
 quitting never works.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.965
 Look, guys, we can't give up.

21:06.066 --> 21:08.468
   We gotta save this place.

21:08.501 --> 21:11.471
 So get off your tails
 and make a donation.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.941
   Let's keep The Max alive!

21:17.444 --> 21:21.381
   All right, hey, hey, hey,
   don't get so excited yet.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.717
  Let's see if anyone calls.

21:26.086 --> 21:28.455
Come on, ring.

21:31.191 --> 21:33.259
( phone rings )

21:33.293 --> 21:36.262
  ( phones ringing )

21:36.296 --> 21:39.232
   ( all cheering )

21:46.906 --> 21:49.542
 ( instrumental music plays )
