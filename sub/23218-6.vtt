00:27.428 --> 00:29.797
MAN:
Hey, look.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.666
WOMAN:
Oh, wow.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.502
:
I feel like I'm dreaming.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.170
MAN:
I told you you'd love it.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.871
WOMAN :
I had to work up the courage.

00:37.905 --> 00:40.241
You've had your pilot's license
for all of a month.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.275
Had no faith.

00:44.145 --> 00:47.415
* Baby, kiss me...

00:47.448 --> 00:49.016
MAN:
Now, look.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.118
Wow.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.853
It's amazing.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.188

KATE:
Our first date.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.527
MAN:
Best day of my life.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.062
-I'm gonna swing us back around,
okay? -Okay.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.865
* All I worship and adore...

01:06.734 --> 01:07.901
-Crap.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.438
-Aah, aah!
-This is not good.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.440
KATE: What's not
What's happening?

01:12.473 --> 01:13.907
MAN: Uh, th-there's a binder
under your seat.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.909
Grab it.
Last page is a checklist.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.645
Um, uh, okay.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.912
-Uh...
-Now, last one.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.448
Okay. Okay, here.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.550
"Emergency landing
without engine power"?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.417
Read the list, babe.

01:23.451 --> 01:26.920
-Um, "Airspeed 65 knots."
-Check.

01:26.954 --> 01:30.057
-KATE: "Mixture idle cutoff."
-MAN: Check.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.725
-"Verify flight ring
is engaged." -Check.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.627
KATE:
"Initiate engagement process."

01:33.661 --> 01:37.731
-Check. -"Confirm pilot is
head over heels in love

01:37.765 --> 01:40.801
with the passenger."

01:40.834 --> 01:42.503
-MAN: Check.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.737
KATE:
"Will the pilot promise

01:43.771 --> 01:45.273
"to love and cherish

01:45.306 --> 01:48.576
the passenger

01:48.609 --> 01:51.445
MAN:
Double check.

01:53.681 --> 01:57.751
-I love you so much, Kate.
-I hate you.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.954
MAN:
What do you say

02:00.988 --> 02:02.523
:
Will you be my copilot?

02:09.029 --> 02:10.431
Kate.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.368
Hey, Kate. Kate?

02:14.402 --> 02:15.769
-Aah!

02:15.803 --> 02:17.505
Kate! Kate! Kate!

02:33.821 --> 02:36.123
Oh, okay.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.891
Tell me what happened
up there, sir.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.361
Was she complaining
of chest pain or nausea?

02:40.394 --> 02:42.530
No, no, nothing.
She just passed out.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.532
Is she on any medications?

02:44.565 --> 02:46.800
Uh, yeah, uh, some kind of
thyroid medication,

02:46.834 --> 02:48.469
but nothing serious.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.003
I can't believe I did this.
I think I did this.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.572
Did what, sir?

02:51.605 --> 02:54.408
I-I pretended there was
something wrong with the plane.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.043
Why would you do that?

02:56.076 --> 02:58.145
I had a proposal written out
on the emergency instructions.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.147
-I was gonna propose
on Valentine's Day -Okay. Um...

03:00.180 --> 03:01.549
and I don't want
to be so on the nose,

03:01.582 --> 03:02.583
so I thought I'd do it
a few days early.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.485
Okay, okay, listen to me.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.019
You have to get her
on the ground.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.021
Have you notified
Air Traffic Control?

03:08.055 --> 03:09.257
Yeah, yeah, they said
I could touch down

03:09.290 --> 03:10.691
at Burbank Airport
in 15 minutes.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.159
Is there any place closer

03:12.192 --> 03:13.427
where you could make
an emergency landing?

03:19.132 --> 03:20.334
Get off. Get off.

03:32.880 --> 03:33.914
Brakes, brakes, brakes.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.673
-All right, let's put her
over here. -Okay.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.112
Does she have any history
of heart problems?

04:05.145 --> 04:06.146
MAN:
No, she's only 32.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.214
How does this happen?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.382
Blood pressure's 80/40.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.817
Still dropping.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.319
Hen, looks like a possible
heart attack.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.686
Nitro sublingual.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.160
-Hey, Abbs, I'm-I'm on a call.
-ABBY: Okay, but don't hang up.

04:20.193 --> 04:21.629
I'm the one who took
the call you're on.

04:21.662 --> 04:22.930
Listen, after he told me
about the stunt that he pulled

04:22.963 --> 04:24.832
and he told me
about her condition,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.233
I called her doctor.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.267
Wait, wh

04:27.301 --> 04:28.268
ABBY:
Oh, he didn't tell you?

04:28.302 --> 04:30.471
Romeo faked an air emergency.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.640
You faked an emergency?

04:32.673 --> 04:34.675
I was proposing.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.176
I thought I was being romantic.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.144
ABBY:
The doctor says

04:37.177 --> 04:38.412
she's on levothyroxine

04:38.446 --> 04:39.647
for her thyroid condition,

04:39.680 --> 04:41.482
which you know can
'cause heart palpitations.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.950
Guys, she's on levothyroxine.

04:44.952 --> 04:45.919
Not a heart attack.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.255
Broken heart syndrome?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.257
-That's what I'm thinking.
-Okay.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.460
-I'll get the adenosine.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.261
Mimics the symptoms
of a heart attack.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.664
It was probably brought on
by her thyroid medication

04:56.697 --> 04:58.298
and you nearly scaring her
half to death.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.867
HEN: You don't treat it
the same as a cardiac event.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.335
That nitro we almost gave her

05:01.369 --> 05:02.670
could've caused
some real damage.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.107
All right, she's coming to.
She's coming to.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.308
That's it.
Take some deep breaths.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.545
Good call, Abby.
She's, uh, she's conscious.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.381
She's conscious,
she's conscious.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.015
-You're okay.
-BOBBY: You're okay.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.216
Deep breaths, deep breaths.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.851
Oh, baby, thank God.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.520
BOBBY: All right,
you think you can sit up?

05:19.553 --> 05:20.654
Here, take it slowly.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.692
KATE :
Can I see the ring again?

05:24.725 --> 05:26.293
Wait, what's happening?

05:26.326 --> 05:29.497
I think she's actually
considering his proposal.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.875
Yes.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.544
She said yes.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.580
And she smacked him.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.516
Love hurts.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.854
Good. All right.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.624
Now, three tablespoons of sugar.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.928
The tablespoons are
the bigger ones, Mom.

06:00.961 --> 06:01.929
I know.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.063
Let her remember.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.733
Remember? Mom.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.336
Honestly? I think this
is the first time

06:09.369 --> 06:11.071
I've ever seen
you bake anything.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.273
Oh.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.208
I mean, Dad always
did the cooking.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.244
Well, I made plenty
of reservations.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.115
And now you're making
Valentine's cookies.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.851
I love Valentine's Day.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.453
It's, like, the one day
of the year

06:25.486 --> 06:29.189
we can be sappy and romantic
and in love with love.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.625
So, then, why are you dating

06:31.659 --> 06:33.461
a guy who only likes
to bone on the phone?

06:33.494 --> 06:36.063
We're not dating, Carla.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.265
Although he did invite me
to the party at the firehouse.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.635
I don't know. It's getting
kind of irritating.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.537
I mean, I'm fine with him
being a boy toy.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.573
You know, I'm all right
with that.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.742
But he's so afraid he's gonna
do something wrong or hurt me

06:48.776 --> 06:50.744
or something.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.880
: Frankly, I just want
to put on some fancy underwear,

06:52.913 --> 06:54.081
-and...

06:54.114 --> 06:56.383
...get my hair done, and go out,

06:56.416 --> 06:58.552
and have a nice time
and feel special.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.488
Amen to that.

07:00.521 --> 07:04.391
Well, maybe if Buck
doesn't pull through,

07:04.424 --> 07:06.326
we'll all do a girls' night.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.729
-Ooh.
-CARLA: No. No way.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.132
A woman like you, smart and sexy
with hair like an angel

07:12.165 --> 07:14.568
deserves a real Valentine's Day.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.336
If he doesn't want to give it
to you, honey, then...

07:16.369 --> 07:18.906
...sayonara, fireboy.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.474
-Oh, yes.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.109
Okay.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.348
God, I hate Valentine's Day.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.951
Everywhere you look,
it's perfume ads, candy ads,

07:30.984 --> 07:32.986
jewelry ads.
It is a fake holiday

07:33.020 --> 07:36.356
designed by women to make guys
feel guilty and go into debt.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.358
You think it's just women
who run the companies

07:38.391 --> 07:39.793
that are trying
to sell you those things?

07:39.827 --> 07:43.531
BUCK:
Well, they're at least in on it.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.266
Well, I know plenty of women...

07:46.299 --> 07:49.302
who don't like Valentine's Day
and plenty of guys who love it.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.938
You?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.339
Yeah.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.207
Here and there,
I've been known

07:54.241 --> 07:57.210
since I was about eight years
old to like Valentine's Day.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.346
And after I met my wife,

07:59.379 --> 08:02.950
I'll tell you what...

08:02.983 --> 08:04.284
you have someone
to share it with,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.119
it could be pretty great.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.889
You must miss her a lot
on Valentine's Day.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.629
Miss her every day, Buck.

08:15.663 --> 08:16.997
Miss her every day.

08:22.603 --> 08:27.474
* Here comes Johnny Yen again

08:27.507 --> 08:29.076
* With the liquor and drugs...

08:29.109 --> 08:30.510
Welcome back, Chim.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.553
Aw, you guys.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.988
BUCK:
How does it feel to be back?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.690
Uh, beats the alternative.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.593
Seriously, though, everybody,

08:45.626 --> 08:48.495
uh, one thing I realized
while I was gone

08:48.528 --> 08:51.498
is that, uh, I really need
you people

08:51.531 --> 08:53.333
like I need a hole in the head!

08:53.366 --> 08:54.935
-Oh! I cannot.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.405
Place hasn't been
the same without you, Chim.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.040
You're the heart
of this firehouse.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.274
I'm glad to have you back.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.943
Thanks, Bobby.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.712
ATHENA: Hey, you had a lot
of people praying for you,

09:04.745 --> 09:06.379
not just this department,
either.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.515
Well, I think somebody
was listening.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.018
Even the doctors kept
using the word "miracle."

09:11.051 --> 09:12.686
I guess if you're gonna have
a piece of rebar

09:12.720 --> 09:15.455
that's sticking through your
skull, that's the way to do it.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.758
-Just you, Buck.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.227
-Oh. Shade, shade, shade, shade,
shade. -Oh, that's not funny.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.195
-Shade, shade. -BOBBY:
All right. Let's light you up

09:22.229 --> 09:24.531
-so you can make a wish.
-All right.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.966
All right, who's got a match?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.601
Really?

09:27.635 --> 09:29.870
Firehouse and
nobody's got a match?

09:49.657 --> 09:53.093
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.562
Can I help you?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.665
Yeah, uh, I'm here
for the party.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.900
Oh, you're a friend
of Chimney's. Come on.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.568
No, I'm not a friend.
I mean, I feel like

10:01.601 --> 10:03.236
I know Chimney, but...
'cause I feel like I...

10:03.270 --> 10:04.972
You're... are you Captain Nash?

10:05.005 --> 10:06.106
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.174
I'm sorry, who are you?

10:07.207 --> 10:09.109
Abby Clark, a friend of Buck's.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.978
Oh, you're the woman
from the phone.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.947
-Yes...
-911 operator.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.248
-Right. Yes, yes, yes.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.449
-BUCK: Hey, Abby.
-Hi.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.851
-You showed. That's so cool.
-Hi.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.653
How are you doing?
It's good to see you.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.354
-Hi.
-Hey.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.256
-BUCK: And you brought cookies.
-ABBY: I brought cookies.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.025
Come on up.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.595
Uh, so, everyone, um,
this is Abby Clark.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.665
She is L.A.'s fiercest
911 operator

10:31.699 --> 10:33.033
and she brought cookies, so...

10:33.066 --> 10:34.868
-Ah, there you go.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.103
Come on in.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.204
This is, uh, this is Chimney.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.672
-The-the guy...
-CHIMNEY: Hi.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.140
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.474
-This is Ab-Abby.
-Oh, I'm good.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.343
-I can barely feel it now.
-ABBY: Oh, great.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.611
Uh, would you like some cake?

10:44.644 --> 10:45.813
-No, I'm good. Thank you.
-Okay.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.447
Uh, okay, come on, come on.
There's...

10:47.480 --> 10:49.316
-It's nice to meet you.
-You, too.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.685
I was gonna light the candle.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.389
I get dumped after surviving
rebar through my skull

10:56.423 --> 10:57.891
and he ends up with her?

10:57.925 --> 11:01.328
What's that kid have
that I don't?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.863
Forget I asked.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.397
-Yes.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.866
-All right.
-I want a lot of ice cream.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.300
ABBY:
Oh, God.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.402
-Yeah, it's...

11:09.436 --> 11:10.838
that's one thing
to say about it.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.806
-It's cool.
-Hey.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.875
-Yeah.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.476
-Nice to see you.
-You, too.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.178
-Oh, you know what,

11:18.211 --> 11:19.646
she's doing fine.
Thank you.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.081
-Thanks for asking.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.683
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.018
I'm Hen.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.319
Hi, Hen, I'm Abby.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.355
I work with your boy here.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.157
-Glad to know you really exist.
-Mm.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.158
ABBY:
Thanks.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.692
He talks about you all the time.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.261
Really?

11:34.294 --> 11:37.064
Little. Little bit.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.331
So, where's he taking you?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.666
Valentine's Day tomorrow.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.401
Oh, we, uh...

11:41.434 --> 11:43.536
-We hadn't really, uh...
-Don't. We don't have a plan.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.672
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I-I have to work, and...

11:45.705 --> 11:47.074
Your shift ends at 2:00.
So does mine.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.609
I'm going home to my wife.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.412
Uh, well,
we're just being casual.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.081
It's no big deal.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.116
It's just...
It's just a day.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.218
Yeah, the only day
he's obligated

11:58.251 --> 11:59.519
to show you a good time.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.956
So, what are you doing
for Valentine's Day?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.557
Me?

12:04.591 --> 12:06.459
Hell,

12:06.493 --> 12:08.261
I put in for a extra shift.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.530
I'm doing whatever I can
to get my mind off romance

12:10.563 --> 12:12.265
-for the night.
-Oh.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.533
So, where you taking her?

12:13.566 --> 12:15.035
And it better not be
a salad bar.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.536
-Whoa.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.705
No, you know,
it'll be someplace,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.908
uh, really nice.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.042
-Okay.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.043
-Great. Yeah.
-Cool.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.978
Getting kinda late for a rezzy.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.446
Well, I know people.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.647
HEN:
Oh.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.382
He knows people.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.951
-He knows people.
-Oh, yeah.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.552
Good-bye, Hen.
Good-bye, Hen.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.720
-Ah...

12:33.753 --> 12:35.422
Um, we gotta go.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.657
Um, tomorrow.
How about 7:00?

12:37.690 --> 12:38.725
-Okay. All right.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.928
-All right, see ya.
-Thanks. Go.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.083
Did you not like it?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.451
It's good, it's just a little
salty for my taste.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.020
Oh. Well, I have a lot
of snacks

13:07.054 --> 13:10.457
for our Valentine's Day
double feature:

13:10.490 --> 13:13.426
The Notebook
and Fatal Attraction.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.762
I'm kidding.
I hate The Notebook.

13:17.464 --> 13:21.334
Uh, we can have sex
during intermission.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.104
You told me you didn't want
to make a V-Day plan,

13:24.137 --> 13:27.640
so that means we get
to do mine instead.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.176
Now is the moment
in my schedule

13:29.209 --> 13:30.643
where you give me my gift.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.512
Oh, right.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.117
-You mentioned, once,

13:37.150 --> 13:38.418
liking that brand, so...

13:42.755 --> 13:44.291
I like chocolate.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.294
I like Le Vian diamonds.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.697
Real diamonds, not Le Vian
diamond-shaped chocolates.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.732
Did you think I was going
to get you real diamonds?

13:52.765 --> 13:54.134
Ted, I had a plan.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.203
A really specific plan
for tonight,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.038
and you're messing it up.

13:58.071 --> 14:01.574
You gave me a $14.00 box of
chocolates for Valentine's Day.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.411
I spent all day cooking
for you and getting waxed

14:04.444 --> 14:06.846
and buying sexy underwear--
I spent hours on tonight.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.481
Maybe you should have spent a
few less hours salting the food.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.651
Okay, that's it, I'm out.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.254
You know, my friends told me
to stay away from you.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.756
Said you had the crazy eyes.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.758
You told me you loved me.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.560
I tell that to everyone.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.930
Okay, you want me to do this
the hard way? Fine.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.331
You're not my only girlfriend.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.033
Okay? I-I can't watch
a movie with you

14:26.066 --> 14:28.035
because I've got plans
with another girl later tonight.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.502
Got her the same box
of chocolates.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.204
You don't mean anything
to me, Melora.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.977
Okay, get out of the way,
Melora.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.830
ATHENA: LAPD.
Open up, please.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.306
You all right, ma'am?

15:06.339 --> 15:08.375
Yes, I'm fine.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.610
We got a noise complaint
from one of your neighbors.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.379
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.481
I got into a fight
with my boyfriend.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.748
It probably got loud.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.150
Is he still here?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.553
:
No, I'm all alone.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.821
Mind if I come in?

15:31.531 --> 15:32.632
I'll just have a look around?

15:32.665 --> 15:34.534
Sure.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.073
MELORA:
Dumped on Valentine's Day.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.408
Can you believe it?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.443
Yeah, well,
men can be dogs.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.746
I just thought he was
a good dog.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.481
Thought he would be the one.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.084
Yeah, well, sometimes the one
isn't even the one.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.153
Take it from me,
you can be married

15:53.186 --> 15:55.788
-and still feel alone.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.957
Sometimes, yeah.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.726
We all do.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.199
But you're wearing
that ring.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.601
Yeah, well, I took a vow.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.038
-That's so beautiful.
-Listen.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.640
Any man who can do this
to you on Valentine's Day,

16:13.673 --> 16:15.042
he ain't worth it.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.509
All right?
You're better off

16:16.543 --> 16:17.544
without him--
you hear me?

16:23.916 --> 16:26.819
That's from a long time ago.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.721
That was really just
a cry for help.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.457
I'll tell you what.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.559
You've been through
a lot tonight.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.394
If the blues come back
and you feel like

16:34.427 --> 16:35.395
crying out for help,

16:35.428 --> 16:37.530
you make a call and talk to me.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.732
This is my card.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.634
I'll be on duty all night.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.936
:
You've got a good heart.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.075
-DISPATCHER: Available units.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.476
Available units,
211 in progress,

16:49.509 --> 16:51.911
corner of Beverly
and Vermont.

16:51.944 --> 16:56.049
727-L-30.
Show me en route.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.150
You okay?

16:57.184 --> 16:58.785
I will be now.
Thank you.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.023
I just got some
excellent advice

17:37.056 --> 17:38.625
from a very wise woman.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.568
You sure you don't
want me to stay?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.203
I feel bad, you and Chimney

17:50.237 --> 17:51.604
having to pull double shifts.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.373
Aw, Chimney's so excited
to be back,

17:53.406 --> 17:55.442
he'd work four shifts in a row
if we asked him to.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.644
I already told Gardner
I'd cover the first half

17:57.677 --> 18:00.046
of his day so he could
spend it with his wife.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.282
So I'm good.
All right, turn around.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.721
What if I screw this up?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.123
Screw it up?

18:10.157 --> 18:12.292
Well, my advice is don't.

18:12.325 --> 18:15.128
Uh, okay, what happens
if we start having sex?

18:15.162 --> 18:17.130
Why would that happen?

18:17.164 --> 18:18.998
'Cause that's what always
happens-- I'm a sex addict.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.133
Self-diagnosed, yeah.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.402
Listen, it's not uncommon

18:22.435 --> 18:25.905
for a guy to use quick,
meaningless sex

18:25.938 --> 18:27.907
to avoid real intimacy.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.009
So you're saying, you know,
it might be okay

18:30.042 --> 18:32.145
to sleep with her, just as long
as I'm not a dick about it?

18:32.179 --> 18:33.246
-I didn't say that.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.182
Is that what
you think I said?

18:35.215 --> 18:36.183
-That's what I heard.
-That's not what I said.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.284
Why don't you try this?

18:37.317 --> 18:38.518
Why don't you try something new?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.353
Why don't you try,
just once,

18:40.387 --> 18:43.022
getting to know her?
Really get to know her.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.457
Okay...

18:45.692 --> 18:47.360
CARLA:
Wow.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.296
It just jumped
ten degrees in here.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.599
You don't look like
a whore at all.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.367
Thanks, Mom.

18:54.401 --> 18:58.871
Well... I'm excited.

18:58.905 --> 19:02.108
And with any luck,
nobody'll get hurt.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.377
Okay, look, I need you
to stop worrying about

19:04.411 --> 19:05.845
everybody else's
wants and feelings,

19:05.878 --> 19:07.214
and start worrying about
your own, okay?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.048
Fine. I'm just...
I'm excited.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.451
It's Valentine's Day
and I'm going out.

19:11.484 --> 19:15.555
Okay, so I should...
not sleep with her tonight.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.156
-Correct.
-Okay.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.158
You should not have sex
with her tonight

19:19.192 --> 19:20.860
if you're really interested
in her.

19:20.893 --> 19:24.163
A woman like that deserves
a little chivalry.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.566
Chivalry?
Okay, I like that.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.001
You know, and...
don't be a dick.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.903
You know what, Buck,
I think if you focus

19:30.937 --> 19:33.640
on the first part, the second
part'll take care of itself.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.342
-Geez. -I got it, I got it.
Let me try on this jacket.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.153
-You look real handsome.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.255
-Yeah.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.056
-Okay. Good.
-Good luck.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.924
I don't want it.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.025
Good luck keeping it
in your pants.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.027
No, I'm not... Bobby!

20:20.152 --> 20:22.221
I need you to back up, sir.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.192
So, what's the situation here?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.794
12 cars, no fatalities.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.296
But we got a medical
transport vehicle

20:29.329 --> 20:31.130
sandwiched in there.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.633
Driver's freaking out.
Says they were delivering

20:33.666 --> 20:35.902
an organ for transplant.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.905
Please, this organ has to get to
Southland Medical immediately.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.240
The patient is critical.
She's prepped and waiting.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.675
I got this.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.948
Buckle up, buttercup.

21:05.164 --> 21:07.434
MED TECH:
Uh, what...

21:07.467 --> 21:09.469
what... okay.
Whoa.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.937
Whoa. Whoa!

21:10.970 --> 21:11.838
Oh, g...

21:13.172 --> 21:15.241
ATHENA:
Hang on.

21:15.274 --> 21:20.012
* There goes my heart...

21:21.514 --> 21:23.149
MED TECH: I don't think
we're gonna make it.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.585
ATHENA:
Oh, we're gonna make it.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.355
* There goes the one I love

21:28.388 --> 21:31.023
This is unit 727-L-30.

21:31.057 --> 21:35.695
I need a manual traffic control
at the 10 freeway onramp

21:35.728 --> 21:36.863
eastbound at Alameda.

21:36.896 --> 21:40.299
* I wasn't worthy of

21:42.234 --> 21:43.703
OFFICER: This is uniform.
We've got you covered.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.406
* There goes my happiness

21:49.008 --> 21:50.309
* It couldn't be...

21:50.343 --> 21:52.445
MED TECH: Red light.
Red--

21:52.479 --> 21:55.314
Red light. Red light!
Ah! Whoa, God!

21:55.348 --> 21:59.251
-* There goes somebody else

22:03.322 --> 22:05.825
The transplant recipient.
Whose life are we saving?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.694
MED TECH:
Her name is Anna Cerritos.

22:07.727 --> 22:11.163
She's a 16-year-old high school
student from Seattle.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.365
Her whole family's flown
out here to be with her.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.300
All right,
we got you, Anna.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.568
* It couldn't last somehow

22:15.602 --> 22:17.537
MED TECH:
Whoa, big truck.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.938
White truck.
Truck truck!

22:20.540 --> 22:24.010
* I never thought...

22:24.043 --> 22:26.513
No, any...!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:28.247 --> 22:29.248
Look out!

22:33.019 --> 22:35.655
* There goes my heart...

22:35.688 --> 22:36.689
ATHENA:
Here we are.

22:39.025 --> 22:39.992
Thank God.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.695
* And here

22:44.764 --> 22:46.098
* Am I.

22:51.137 --> 22:54.073
Thank you, Officer. You may have
saved a life tonight.

22:54.106 --> 22:56.743
ATHENA: Well, I can't
think of anything better

22:56.776 --> 23:00.547
than delivering a heart
on Valentine's Day.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.881
That was a kidney.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.385
Kidneys are good.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.055
:
727-L-30,

23:09.088 --> 23:11.190
this is Dispatch. Come in.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.125
Go for 727-L-30.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.462
DISPATCHER: Sergeant Grant,
police welfare check requested

23:15.495 --> 23:18.364
at 844 Sanborn, Los Angeles.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.633
Show 727-L-30 responding.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.343
-Sergeant Athena, you came.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.818
Uh... I was under
the impression

23:38.851 --> 23:41.253
that, uh, you were
having distress?

23:41.287 --> 23:42.421
I was having a moment.

23:42.455 --> 23:45.592
Happy Valentine's Day!

23:45.625 --> 23:48.561
Did you know See's Candies
is open 24

23:48.595 --> 23:51.297
I just... I wanted to thank you
for your kind words earlier.

23:51.330 --> 23:52.298
Oh...

23:52.331 --> 23:53.566
I ate all the caramel ones.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.101
Uh, wh-- wait, you know,

23:55.134 --> 23:57.436
this is, this is very sweet
of you, but, um...

23:57.470 --> 23:59.506
You really didn't
have to do this.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.642
I just...
You were so kind to me,

24:02.675 --> 24:04.410
and I was thinking,

24:04.443 --> 24:06.913
-we're both members of
The Lonely Hearts Club. -Um...

24:06.946 --> 24:08.414
-To The Lonely Hearts Club!

24:08.447 --> 24:09.849
Oh, my God.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.484
Oh, I'm so sorry.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.419
-Oh, here, let me just, um...
-No. Oh, no, no.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.688
No, no, no, no.
It's fine. It's fine.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.190
I-I appreciate the thought.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.961
Um, may I use your restroom
and then go?

24:21.994 --> 24:25.498
Of course. You're working.
I'm sorry.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.534
It's just down the hall
to the left.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.675
MELORA:
There's hydrogen peroxide

24:35.708 --> 24:37.777
under the sink if you need it.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.179
-Thank you. I'm fine.
-If that doesn't work,

24:40.212 --> 24:41.313
there's ammonia
under there, too.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.883
That works really well on blood.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.482
Melora.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.484
I'm gonna need to get, uh,

25:18.517 --> 25:21.387
your ex-boyfriend's phone number
for my report.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.864
Melora?

25:59.592 --> 26:01.728
Wish you hadn't gone in there.

26:01.761 --> 26:04.897
The superglue's still drying.
It isn't ready yet.

26:10.436 --> 26:11.904
Think this'll work?

26:11.938 --> 26:13.706
I'd actually recommend
this one, sir.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.142
-Okay. -Full-bodied red. Pair
nicely with both of your meals.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.210
-Fantastic. That's what we'll
go with. -ABBY: He's so cute.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.246
-Thank you. -Oh, God, I wonder
if he'll ask to see his ID.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.882
What if he asks
to see his and not mine?

26:24.951 --> 26:26.552
-Ahh.
-Hey.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.220
You weren't kidding.
You really do know people.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.622
I don't know how
you got us in here.

26:29.656 --> 26:32.258
I, uh, I know the owner.
Well, I-I met him, um...

26:32.291 --> 26:35.928
We, uh... we contained
a noxious gas leak for them

26:35.962 --> 26:37.129
-a couple weeks ago, so...
-Oh...

26:37.163 --> 26:38.230
Yeah, just try
not to breathe much.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.265
Yeah, do that.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.100
-Uh...

26:41.133 --> 26:42.334
Um, uh, no.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.303
It's fine.
Uh, he was really appreciative.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.673
Thank you very much.

26:50.643 --> 26:54.613
Uh, yeah, sure.
Tastes like wine to me.

26:55.982 --> 26:58.184
-Thank you.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.652
-Oh, no thanks.

26:59.686 --> 27:02.321
-Oh, please. Go ahead.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.589
BUCK:
Man, she's pretty.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.757
Her hair's amazing.

27:04.791 --> 27:05.958
Look like that before?

27:05.992 --> 27:07.626
Buck, stop.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.996
Remember,
you're not sleeping with her.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.099
ABBY:
I think I can see his muscles

27:13.132 --> 27:14.767
through that jacket.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.535
Cheers. Thank you.

27:16.568 --> 27:17.770
And happy Valentine's Day.

27:17.804 --> 27:21.040
: Cheers.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.109
-Cheers.
-Mm.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.778
-Be cool. I'm not
choking in front of her.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.646
-Yeah.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.316
Oh, God. Oh, God. Wait,
don't drink, 'cause you could...

27:30.349 --> 27:32.451
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.920
Oh, God. Wait, don't drink.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.790
-Do you know the Heimlich
maneuver? -I do. Get him up.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.025
-Okay.
-Get him up.

27:40.159 --> 27:40.993
He's not breathing.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.045
Come on, Buck.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.479
-Call 911.
-We already did.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.314
Call 'em again.
Put 'em on speaker.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.417
OPERATOR: 911.
What's your emergency?

28:05.451 --> 28:08.087
It's emergency dispatcher
Abby Clark, Parker Center.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.421
I'm not on site.

28:09.455 --> 28:10.890
I need to speak
to Stephanie Gaskins

28:10.923 --> 28:13.025
in Emergency Medical Dispatch.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.093
STEPHANIE:
This is EMD Gaskins.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.361
Steph, it's Abby.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.663
-ABBY: I've got an adult male,

28:17.696 --> 28:19.331
fully obstructed air pipe.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.734
-Yes, but he's unconscious.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.569
I can't remove the object.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.271
He stopped breathing
two minutes ago.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.739
Another three minutes,

28:26.773 --> 28:27.907
and he's gonna have
brain damage.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.241
I need you to walk me through

28:29.275 --> 28:30.910
an emergency tracheotomy.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.745
Abby, have you lost your mind?

28:32.779 --> 28:34.113
Come on.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.949
You know the paramedics are
gonna be at least seven minutes.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.350
I can't let this happen.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.119
I've got to do something.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.021
You got a knife?
Something sharp?

28:42.054 --> 28:43.455
And you're going
to need something

28:43.489 --> 28:45.858
to keep the airway open,
like a pen or a straw.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.394
A knife a-and a pen
or a straw, something.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.197
-Okay.
-WAITER: Here.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.032
Thanks.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.600
Find the indentation
between his Adam's apple

28:54.633 --> 28:56.035
and the cricoid cartilage.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.870
Okay.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.872
Yup. Okay, I think I found it.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.874
STEPHANIE: You're going to make
a horizontal incision,

29:01.908 --> 29:03.242
a half-inch wide

29:03.275 --> 29:04.576
and about half-inch deep.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.178
Oh, my God.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.282
Oh, God.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.652
Oh, God. Okay.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.922
STEPHANIE: There shouldn't be
a lot of blood,

29:15.955 --> 29:17.756
but try to keep it
from leaking into his windpipe.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.425
Okay, I did it.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.393
STEPHANIE: Okay, stick
your finger in, open it up.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.296
: Oh, God.
Oh, my God. Okay, okay, okay.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.531
Get the pen in there.

29:27.766 --> 29:28.767
Two quick breaths.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.671
Five seconds. Four...

29:32.704 --> 29:35.541
Three... Two.
Another quick breath.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.751
PARAMEDIC: Excuse me, excuse me.
Gurney coming through.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.420
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.655
-PARAMEDIC: Gurney coming
through. -You're okay.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.711
CHIMNEY: Was the caller
the only one in the house?

30:12.744 --> 30:15.347
BOBBY: As far as I know,
but if not, he could be laid up.

30:15.381 --> 30:16.883
You might have to bust
the door open.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.951
Check in there, too.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.355
LAFD, anybody home?

30:25.391 --> 30:28.660
Los Angeles Fire Department,
anybody home?

30:28.694 --> 30:30.462
-All right, Chim, go ahead.
-All right.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.865
Bust it open.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.169
CHRISTINA:
Um...

30:37.203 --> 30:38.804
Hi. Can I help you?

30:38.837 --> 30:41.540
Uh, yes, a man called 911,
gave us this address.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.143
Said he had fallen,
he was in some kind of distress.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.345
Male in distress?

30:46.378 --> 30:47.980
No.
I'm the only man here,

30:48.014 --> 30:50.016
and pretty sure
I'm not in distress.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.418
And the two of you
have been home all night?

30:52.451 --> 30:54.186
I-I was. Alex...

30:54.220 --> 30:56.655
I told her I had to work
on Valentine's Day.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.259
You should have seen
how pissed off she was at me.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.727
But it was all part of the plan.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.896
He came home and surprised me
with flowers

31:03.930 --> 31:06.232
-and takeout from Mr. Chows.
-Yeah, her favorite.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.866
I'm a serious romantic.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.835
So you weren't
expecting him home until later?

31:09.868 --> 31:12.038
Not for hours.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.872
Uh, would you guys mind

31:13.906 --> 31:15.774
if we took a quick peek
around the perimeter?

31:15.807 --> 31:17.376
It's procedure.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.745
Yeah, yeah. Of course.
You want me to show you around?

31:19.778 --> 31:21.580
No. We've got it. You can
get back to your romance.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.983
Yes.

31:30.456 --> 31:31.590
Got it?

31:31.623 --> 31:32.758
Watch your step, there, Captain.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.793
Watch your step.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.433
See anything, Chim?

31:41.467 --> 31:43.002
Nothing over here.

31:47.173 --> 31:49.141
Hey, Chim.

31:49.175 --> 31:51.043
Over here.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.778
Oh. Shh.

31:52.811 --> 31:55.081
: Come here.
-Don't move. Do not move, sir.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.649
-You jumped from up there,
didn't you? -Yeah. Yes.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.118
Okay.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.253
-How many fingers
am I holding up? -Uh, two.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.322
-Uh, Valentine's Day.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.591
They broken? -Ow.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.160
-Ah... -There's deformity.
They're both broken.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.229
BOBBY: Sir, I'm just gonna
stabilize your neck.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.797
There.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.000
-Ah.
-So you sustained

32:14.033 --> 32:15.901
what we call
a Casanova Fracture.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.670
What, uh, w-why is it called
a Casanova Fracture?

32:18.704 --> 32:20.406
Well, woman is having an affair,

32:20.439 --> 32:23.675
husband comes home early,
the guy jumps off: Casanova.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.011
Oh, God.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.912
-Y-ow, ow, ow!

32:26.945 --> 32:28.247
-Sir, take it easy, we're gonna
roll you over. -Careful. No.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.315
On the count of three.
-No. No!

32:29.348 --> 32:30.416
-One, two, three.
-No. No.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.584
Oh, God! Oh...

32:32.618 --> 32:33.919
CHIMNEY:
You're okay. You're all right.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.087
You're okay. Yeah, okay.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.423
MICKEY:
Oh, God, my leg. Ow!

32:39.458 --> 32:40.993
What the... oh, God.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.028
What the hell is going...?

32:42.061 --> 32:44.963
Was he in here when I got home?

32:44.997 --> 32:46.999
-You said you were gonna be
at work. -Oh.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.434
BOBBY: All right, take a breath.
This man has been

32:48.467 --> 32:50.469
severely injured,
and you can work this

32:50.502 --> 32:51.670
all out with your wife
once we get him

32:51.703 --> 32:53.172
medical attention
and get him out of here.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.674
-She's not my wife.
-She's my wife.

32:59.211 --> 33:00.946
We're separated.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.781
You said it was done
between the two of you.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.350
You asked me to move in here.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.618
-I'm sorry. I-I really am.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.887
There's just so much history
between us.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.289
So many memories.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.790
:
Oh, God!

33:12.891 --> 33:14.060
CHRISTINA:
Baby.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.161
MICKEY:
What?

33:15.194 --> 33:16.395
I am so sorry.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.463
Are you okay?

33:17.496 --> 33:18.797
Uh, I'm okay.

33:18.830 --> 33:19.965
I'm okay. I love you.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.067
I love... I love you.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.401
I love you!

33:22.434 --> 33:23.869
CHRISTINA:
Wait.

33:23.902 --> 33:25.337
Wait, can I ride with him

33:25.371 --> 33:27.139
-BOBBY: Yeah, so long

33:27.173 --> 33:30.042
as the divorce papers
aren't signed yet.

33:35.247 --> 33:37.583
So was that creepy or romantic?

33:37.616 --> 33:39.585
Eh, a little of both.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.620
-Got to love Valentine's Day.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.699
This...

33:53.732 --> 33:56.435
This was supposed
to be a surprise.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.239
Ted didn't seem
to appreciate the effort

34:00.272 --> 34:02.408
I put into
Valentine's Day, but...

34:02.441 --> 34:03.875
he will once I'm done with him.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.345
Once you're done with him?

34:06.378 --> 34:09.715
Melora, you chopped him up and
superglued him back together.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.883
Well, yeah. How would you
have done it?

34:11.917 --> 34:14.720
Melora, stop it.
Look at me.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.522
Look at me.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.023
You're sick.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.591
And it's not your fault.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.193
You're on so many drugs,

34:21.227 --> 34:22.628
you don't know
what you're doing.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.296
No, that's not true.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.898
I know exactly what I'm doing.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.934
And actually, you know what?

34:28.967 --> 34:31.970
I'm so sick of people telling me
what's wrong with me.

34:32.003 --> 34:34.039
There's nothing wrong
with my brain.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.242
It's my heart.
I have a broken heart.

34:36.275 --> 34:40.912
Melora, you're suffering,
and you've been hurt.

34:40.946 --> 34:42.914
And I can relate.

34:42.948 --> 34:45.251
You have to believe me
when I tell you

34:45.284 --> 34:48.387
that heartbreak
doesn't last forever.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.389
But some mistakes do.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.158
Now whatever happens
after tonight,

34:52.191 --> 34:56.595
the system can-can go easy
on a woman scorned,

34:56.628 --> 34:58.630
but not on one who hurts a cop.

35:00.499 --> 35:03.068
So untie me. I can help you,

35:03.101 --> 35:05.971
but you have to untie me.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.408
WOMAN:
Somebody help me, please!

35:09.441 --> 35:12.244
-Help me!
-Well, look who finally woke up.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.180
Who else is here, Melora?

35:14.213 --> 35:15.981
Ashleigh.

35:16.014 --> 35:18.750
The girl Ted was gonna
spend Valentine's Day with.

35:18.784 --> 35:22.087
He met her at the gym because
could he be more of a cliché?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.955
I saw it in their texts.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.657
And then I texted her
from his phone

35:25.691 --> 35:27.359
and told her to come here
for a romantic rendezvous...

35:27.393 --> 35:29.761
-I bashed her over the head

35:29.795 --> 35:31.129
when she came, with a pan,

35:31.163 --> 35:33.098
a couple times,
but not enough, apparently,

35:33.131 --> 35:34.900
'cause she hasn't lost
the ability to speak.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.271
She's not a good person.
She's not like us.

35:39.305 --> 35:43.842
-ASHLEIGH: Please help me!
-Or maybe she's a victim, too.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.312
Maybe Ted duped her,
just like he did you.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.214
No.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.782
Maybe he didn't tell her that
he already had a girlfriend.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.018
No, she knew.

35:53.051 --> 35:56.622
-They probably had a good laugh
about me! -Help, please!

35:56.655 --> 36:01.227
Well, maybe you should bring her
up here so we can find out.

36:01.260 --> 36:02.394
We could talk to her together.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.895
You think I should
kill her up here?

36:03.929 --> 36:05.964
No, you shouldn't
hurt that girl.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.333
She has to die tonight,

36:07.366 --> 36:09.000
because what if she tries
to get Ted back?

36:09.034 --> 36:12.404
Sweetheart, Ted's dead.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.306
He won't be
once I fix him, okay?

36:14.340 --> 36:16.375
Ted was perfect.
He had a job, he was handsome,

36:16.408 --> 36:17.676
the sex was great.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.478
Only problem was that
he had an awful,

36:19.511 --> 36:21.480
cheating heart.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.482
He just needs a new heart,
a good one.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.717
ASHLEIGH:
Help!

36:25.751 --> 36:28.220
-It doesn't work that way.
-Course it does.

36:28.254 --> 36:31.490
You're a really good person,
Athena.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.891
You honored your vows.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.193
You were so nice to me.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.396
That's why I had you
come back here tonight

36:37.429 --> 36:41.333
because your heart
is so wonderful and pure.

36:41.367 --> 36:44.736
And if I can take your heart
and put it in Ted,

36:44.770 --> 36:46.772
then all of my dreams come true.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.016
MELORA:
This says I need a handsaw

36:58.049 --> 36:59.585
to get through your rib cage.
I mean, who the heck

36:59.618 --> 37:00.786
has a handsaw
just lying around?

37:00.819 --> 37:02.888
Whatever, I'll make it work.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.089
That's what Melora does.

37:04.122 --> 37:05.291
Makes the best out of things.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.892
Creating art from garbage.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.594
Get your hands off of me.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.396
How am I supposed to cut your
heart out if I can't touch you?

37:20.238 --> 37:23.174
Do you know the real history
of Valentine's Day?

37:24.443 --> 37:26.111
It started in Roman times

37:26.144 --> 37:29.381
as a pagan ritual
to Lupercalia.

37:29.415 --> 37:32.951
I know this because my daughter
did a report on it for school.

37:32.984 --> 37:36.722
The men of the towns would strip
naked and run down the streets,

37:36.755 --> 37:39.458
beating unmarried women
or infertile women,

37:39.491 --> 37:40.726
because they thought
the beatings

37:40.759 --> 37:43.228
would somehow cure them.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.164
Or help find them a husband.

37:48.166 --> 37:51.637
Then, they sacrificed a dog...

37:51.670 --> 37:52.904
That's not true.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.640
It's to celebrate
Saint Valentine,

37:54.673 --> 37:56.475
the patron saint of love.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.611
ATHENA:
Saint Valentine? Ha!

37:59.645 --> 38:02.448
The patron saint of epileptics,
not lovers.

38:02.481 --> 38:03.782
You're a liar.

38:03.815 --> 38:06.251
And you are a crazy bitch.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.453
Better than a dead one!

38:09.120 --> 38:11.289
SANDRA:
Let me in!

38:11.323 --> 38:12.724
I know you're in there,
you piece of garbage!

38:33.845 --> 38:35.146
Hey, stop it.

38:35.180 --> 38:36.782
Where is he?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.784
-Ted! Ted!
-Miss! Miss, hey!

38:38.817 --> 38:40.185
Hey, who are you?

38:40.218 --> 38:42.287
-Hey! Hey!

38:42.320 --> 38:43.689
Hey! Miss!

38:46.091 --> 38:48.293
Okay, what kind of weird,
kinky crap does he have

38:48.326 --> 38:49.895
-You need to calm down.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.497
Now, who are you?

38:51.530 --> 38:52.831
I'm Sandra.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.866
Ted made a Valentine's date
with me tonight,

38:54.900 --> 38:56.835
and then, he just stood me up.

38:56.868 --> 39:00.506
Ted! You bastard,
I know you're here, you cheater!

39:00.539 --> 39:03.642
I used Find My Phone
to see where you were!

39:03.675 --> 39:05.477
You signed into your iCloud

39:05.511 --> 39:07.646
on my computer
like a damn idiot!

39:07.679 --> 39:10.348
I can track you wherever you are
in this city.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.918
Where is he? I'm gonna kill him.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.520
No, little late for that, honey.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.154
Ted already gave his heart
to someone else.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.056
You were his third date
of the evening.

39:18.089 --> 39:20.559
None of which he's gonna make
because he's dead.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.594
727-L-30 requesting R.A. units,

39:22.628 --> 39:24.396
homicide detectives and backup

39:24.430 --> 39:27.032
at my location
for a crime scene.

39:27.065 --> 39:31.670
Tell them to send a straitjacket
and a horse tranquilizer.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.338
Are you okay?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.340
Yeah.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.742
Thanks to you.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.478
Happy Valentine's Day.

39:40.912 --> 39:43.515
:
Help me, she's crazy.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.585
It's okay, it's okay.
Everything's all right now.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.954
All right,
let's get you out of here.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.889
Who is she?

39:50.922 --> 39:52.791
She?

39:52.824 --> 39:55.026
She's his second date.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.195
You girls need to do better
at picking men.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.601
ANDERSON: Chlorpromazine,
fluphenazine, haloperidol.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.636
These are first-generation
antipsychotics.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.373
ATHENA:
Poor girl.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.610
All she wanted was to be loved.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.712
We'll take it from here,
Sergeant.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.380
Go home and see your husband.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.717
It's Valentine's Day
for a few more hours.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.462
Hi.

40:30.496 --> 40:31.697
BOBBY:
Hi.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.333
How's he doing?

40:35.366 --> 40:38.470
Mm. Still out of it.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.439
Well, from what I understand,

40:41.473 --> 40:43.742
he'd be completely out it
if it hadn't been for you.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.745
Ah. Well...

40:46.778 --> 40:48.647
You saved his life.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.982
The surgeon told me you did
a pretty impressive job, too.

40:52.784 --> 40:56.688
I'm just mostly trying not
to think about it, really.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.863
Listen, you've had
a pretty traumatic night.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.032
If you don't want to sit here
with him, you don't have to.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.166
I can do that.

41:08.199 --> 41:11.069
No, no, no. I-I do, I want to.

41:12.704 --> 41:15.507
I-I'd love the company, though,
if you want to...

41:23.048 --> 41:24.616
Well, some Valentine's Day, huh?

41:26.251 --> 41:28.687
Super romantic.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.622
Well, it's one
he'll never forget.

41:30.656 --> 41:32.658
No. It was all going so great,

41:32.691 --> 41:34.292
until I had to cut a hole
in his throat.

41:36.094 --> 41:40.398
Valentine's Day rarely works out
the way you expect it to.

41:40.431 --> 41:43.301
You know, that's life.
You got to roll with what comes.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.403
Don't know
what's around the corner.

41:45.436 --> 41:47.539
Spoken like
a true first responder.

41:47.573 --> 41:50.642
-No, it's straight
out of the handbook. -Yeah. Yes.

41:50.676 --> 41:53.178
Yeah, I remember.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.413
Seem like you could use
a cup of coffee.

41:55.446 --> 41:59.050
That's okay, right? I mean, you
can't choke on that, can you?

41:59.084 --> 42:01.386
Well, clearly you've never had
the coffee from here before.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.855
-I'll risk it.
-All right.

42:26.712 --> 42:29.514
* One night to be confused

42:29.547 --> 42:32.383
* One night to speed up truth

42:32.417 --> 42:35.220
* We had a promise made

42:35.253 --> 42:37.856
* Four hands and then away

42:37.889 --> 42:40.792
* Both under influence

42:40.826 --> 42:43.461
* We had divine sense

42:43.494 --> 42:46.197
* To know what to say

42:46.231 --> 42:49.935
* Mind is a razor blade

42:49.968 --> 42:54.105
* To call for hands of above

42:54.139 --> 42:56.107
* To lean on

42:56.141 --> 42:59.110
* Wouldn't be good enough

42:59.144 --> 43:02.147
* For me, no

43:06.618 --> 43:09.554
* One night of magic rush

43:09.587 --> 43:12.290
* The start: a simple touch

43:12.323 --> 43:15.126
* One night to push and scream

43:15.160 --> 43:17.763
* And then relief

43:17.796 --> 43:20.766
* Ten days of perfect tunes

43:20.799 --> 43:22.500
* The colors red and blue

43:22.533 --> 43:25.336
* We had a promise made,
we were in love. *
