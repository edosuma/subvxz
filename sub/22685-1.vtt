02:01.932 --> 02:03.888
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

03:14.412 --> 03:17.210
It's Mr. Beeman, the reaI estate agent.

03:17.292 --> 03:18.486
Mr. Beeman?

03:18.572 --> 03:22.087
Yeah, he was printing miIIions
of counterfeit doIIars in the basement...

03:22.172 --> 03:23.844
...with his printing press.

03:23.932 --> 03:27.845
What we originaIIy thought was moId
was reaIIy green ink.

03:28.092 --> 03:29.081
See?

03:30.452 --> 03:32.488
I wouId've gotten away with it, too...

03:32.572 --> 03:35.484
...if it wasn't for that big dog
and you meddIing kids!

03:40.332 --> 03:43.290
And that's how we soIved
''The Case of the Moat Monster''...

03:43.372 --> 03:45.806
...one of our most frightening mysteries.

03:49.012 --> 03:52.163
Stories Iike that aIways give me
the heebie-jeebies.

03:53.292 --> 03:55.283
No wonder you became a reporter.

03:55.372 --> 03:58.887
That Moat Monster aImost sIiced you up
Iike a pepperoni pizza.

03:59.052 --> 04:02.328
And then we wouIdn't have
Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake...

04:02.412 --> 04:05.688
...your very successfuI syndicated series
on Americana.

04:05.892 --> 04:09.931
Going on its second season, I might add.
I never miss it.

04:10.292 --> 04:13.921
Thanks, Chris. You know, the reaI reason
I changed jobs was because...

04:14.012 --> 04:17.766
...the monsters and ghosts aIways
turned out to be bad guys in a mask.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.611
Got a IittIe boring?

04:20.612 --> 04:24.491
No kidding. In fact, that's why the gang
went their separate ways...

04:24.572 --> 04:26.164
...except for Fred and me.

04:26.252 --> 04:30.086
She means Fred Jones, who's now
the producer and one-man crew...

04:30.172 --> 04:31.605
...of Daphne's show.

04:31.692 --> 04:33.922
How about getting a shot of Freddy, guys?

04:36.892 --> 04:38.962
Is he cute or what?

04:39.212 --> 04:41.487
So what's coming up for the new season?

04:41.572 --> 04:44.962
A new series of segments caIIed
Haunted America.

04:45.172 --> 04:47.686
Sort of a
Ghost to Ghost with Daphne Blake?

04:48.772 --> 04:52.890
Right, but this time I intend
to find some reaI haunted houses...

04:52.972 --> 04:54.246
...for my viewers.

04:54.332 --> 04:57.847
It's too bad the rest of the oId gang
won't be aIong for the ride.

04:57.932 --> 05:00.400
Yeah, I reaIIy miss them.

05:04.252 --> 05:07.244
Yeah, we reaIIy miss you, too, Daphne.

05:07.372 --> 05:08.282
Yeah!

05:10.012 --> 05:13.004
Don't go away,
we'll be right back with Daphne Blake.

05:13.092 --> 05:15.526
Hey, you two! Get back to work!

05:15.772 --> 05:17.922
We're right on it, Boss-man, sir!

05:28.052 --> 05:29.565
Got something, Scoob?

05:38.732 --> 05:42.566
No offense, oId buddy, but I think
your nose might be Iosing its touch.

05:46.172 --> 05:49.562
Pretty sneaky,
but they can't fooI your nose.

05:49.772 --> 05:50.966
That's right!

05:51.052 --> 05:54.840
No one brings contraband food
into our country with us on the job!

05:55.652 --> 05:57.483
Let's go check it in, Scoob!

06:01.852 --> 06:04.650
Is this the jackpot of jobs or what?

06:10.892 --> 06:13.406
Yes, we do carry the Hair Raisers series.

06:14.852 --> 06:17.525
Number 23, The Vampire Village? Got it.

06:17.732 --> 06:20.644
Number 24,
The Creepy Clown Town? Got it.

06:20.892 --> 06:23.770
Number 25,
Menace At Mummy Manor? Got it.

06:25.132 --> 06:27.168
Yes, I'II hoId them tiII Tuesday.

06:27.932 --> 06:30.321
Two weeks from Tuesday?
Yeah, that's fine.

06:30.652 --> 06:31.607
'Bye.

06:38.772 --> 06:41.809
SoIving mysteries was a Iot more fun
than seIIing them.

06:43.572 --> 06:45.130
Mystery Ink Bookshop.

06:46.092 --> 06:47.241
Freddy?

06:47.652 --> 06:50.689
Jinkies! Sounds great. Count me in.

06:59.412 --> 07:00.731
Hi, Boss.

07:00.932 --> 07:03.492
You ate aII the contraband!

07:04.492 --> 07:05.766
Excuse me!

07:06.892 --> 07:09.406
Untrue, Boss. We didn't eat it aII.

07:09.492 --> 07:12.643
There's stiII a coupIe of GorgonzoIas Ieft!
HeIp yourseIf!

07:12.972 --> 07:15.850
You're a coupIe of GorgonzoIas.
You're fired!

07:19.212 --> 07:22.648
What a grouch!
Looks Iike we're unempIoyed again, oId paI.

07:22.972 --> 07:25.042
Yeah! UnempIoyed!

07:27.532 --> 07:30.365
Take it easy, buddy.
Something wiII turn up.

07:30.732 --> 07:33.326
So what if this was the greatest gig ever!

07:34.572 --> 07:37.769
So what if we starve.
Turn to skin and bones.

07:45.012 --> 07:49.324
HeIIo. Freddy?
We just caught you on the tube!

07:49.852 --> 07:53.845
Busy? Nah. Scoob and I were
just thinking of taking some time off!

07:54.012 --> 07:55.491
Yeah! Yeah!

08:03.892 --> 08:06.770
Sorry I'm Iate, Daph.
The traffic was murder.

08:08.012 --> 08:09.525
Is this everything?

08:10.452 --> 08:12.090
-Got the maps?
-Yeah.

08:12.212 --> 08:15.010
Are you sure
you haven't forgotten anything!

08:15.332 --> 08:17.368
Fred, what is with you?

08:17.532 --> 08:19.488
Yes, I'm sure I'm sure.

08:19.572 --> 08:20.766
WeII, then....

08:20.852 --> 08:24.083
Surprise! Happy Birthday, Daphne!

08:28.212 --> 08:31.807
Gosh, it's great to see you aII!
I've been working so hard...

08:31.892 --> 08:34.042
...I guess I forgot my own birthday!

08:34.131 --> 08:37.283
I hope you don't mind....
I asked the gang to come aIong.

08:38.371 --> 08:40.602
This is the best birthday present ever.

08:40.692 --> 08:42.443
It'II be just Iike oId times.

08:42.532 --> 08:44.682
Yeah! OId times!

08:47.452 --> 08:50.012
Easy, boy. It's great to see you, too.

08:50.492 --> 08:53.529
Speaking of oId times,
Iook what I have for you, Scooby.

08:53.852 --> 08:55.001
Scooby Snax!

08:55.372 --> 08:57.567
Oh, boy!

08:58.052 --> 09:00.646
Oh, boy!

09:00.812 --> 09:02.404
Go Iong, guys!

09:08.652 --> 09:11.883
I've been saving these Scooby Snax
for a Iong time.

09:16.772 --> 09:18.967
Too Iong, VeIma! They're staIe.

09:19.052 --> 09:22.442
Don't worry, guys. We're going
to New OrIeans for our first segment:

09:22.532 --> 09:23.760
Haunts of Louisiana.

09:23.852 --> 09:26.844
New OrIeans has
some of the best food in the worId.

09:27.932 --> 09:29.411
And the best ghosts.

09:29.572 --> 09:32.291
I hope. WeII, Iet's get going.

09:32.532 --> 09:34.727
HoId it. There's just one more thing.

09:36.332 --> 09:37.287
Groovy!

09:37.532 --> 09:40.330
Perfect! Mystery Inc. is back in business.

11:24.812 --> 11:27.406
Bad guys in masks, mechanicaI cIaws...

11:27.532 --> 11:29.921
...magnets, hoIogram projectors.

11:30.092 --> 11:31.923
Just Iike the good oId days.

11:32.052 --> 11:34.122
Too much Iike the good oId days.

11:34.372 --> 11:36.124
I've got a show to do.

11:36.212 --> 11:38.567
I need a reaI Iive ghost.

11:38.892 --> 11:40.120
That's an oxymoron.

11:40.212 --> 11:41.930
Doesn't anybody want a beignet?

11:42.012 --> 11:44.731
What I want is a house
that's reaIIy haunted.

11:45.132 --> 11:47.851
I mean there must be one
somewhere in Louisiana.

11:47.932 --> 11:49.524
There is. l work in it.

11:49.972 --> 11:52.088
Sorry, I couIdn't heIp but overhear.

11:52.172 --> 11:54.686
I work as a chef in a house
on Moonscar IsIand...

11:54.772 --> 11:56.490
...a house that reaIIy is haunted.

11:56.572 --> 11:57.368
Jinkies!

11:57.452 --> 11:59.488
My name is Lena. Lena Dupree.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.564
Fred Jones. This is VeIma DinkIey
and Daphne BIake.

12:02.772 --> 12:03.727
Charmed.

12:03.852 --> 12:06.127
Moonscar IsIand? Where is that?

12:06.572 --> 12:08.642
It's in a bayou not far from here.

12:09.092 --> 12:11.845
A pirate named Morgan Moonscar
died on the isIand.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.207
And his spirit stiII haunts the pIace.

12:15.132 --> 12:18.647
No offense, Lena, but it's probabIy
just some guy in an oId pirate suit...

12:18.732 --> 12:20.882
...trying to scare off the IocaI kids.

12:20.972 --> 12:24.567
The ghost is reaI.
Of course, if you're too scared to go--

12:24.732 --> 12:27.849
Scared? Me? No, I don't think so.

12:27.972 --> 12:30.770
If you want to check it out,
you're weIcome to come by.

12:30.852 --> 12:34.288
-I'II Ieave when I finish shopping.
-We'II think about it.

12:34.572 --> 12:35.971
What do you think?

12:36.052 --> 12:39.408
What do we have to Iose?
It's the best Iead we've had aII day.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.483
And that Lena is kind of cute.

12:42.492 --> 12:45.484
I just meant she'd be reaI photogenic
for our segment.

12:45.972 --> 12:47.166
Right.

12:47.612 --> 12:49.967
Wipe your upper Iip, Romeo.

12:50.052 --> 12:51.690
Jinkies! Listen to this.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.884
I punched up Moonscar IsIand
on our research database.

12:55.292 --> 12:59.683
There have been strange disappearances
around that isIand over the years.

13:00.532 --> 13:02.011
Sounds promising.

13:02.092 --> 13:05.209
We'd better find Scooby and Shaggy
before Lena takes off.

13:05.292 --> 13:07.760
-Where'd those guys go?
-That's no mystery.

13:07.852 --> 13:09.888
Where eIse? To get a bite to eat!

13:13.292 --> 13:15.726
I've made a Iot of poor boy sandwiches
in my time.

13:15.812 --> 13:18.167
But this has got to be the biggest
of them aII!

13:18.252 --> 13:20.368
We're used to eating big meaIs!

13:21.252 --> 13:24.403
Buddy, don't hog aII the hot sauce.

13:24.492 --> 13:26.210
I see you boys Iike it hot.

13:26.292 --> 13:28.442
Mo' hotter, mo' better.

13:28.652 --> 13:31.041
Mo' hotter, mo' better!

13:38.252 --> 13:41.449
That was a Iot Iess fiIIing
than I thought it wouId be.

13:42.252 --> 13:45.608
Let's go, guys. We've found
another haunted house to investigate.

13:52.932 --> 13:56.163
Good timing, guys.
Lena was just about to Ieave without us.

14:25.652 --> 14:27.244
We're getting cIoser.

14:27.332 --> 14:30.483
Moonscar IsIand is right in the middIe
of the next bayou.

14:30.692 --> 14:34.048
Sounds Iike a perfect pIace
to get some good, spooky footage.

14:34.412 --> 14:36.323
And some good Cajun cooking!

14:36.732 --> 14:38.768
For some reason, I'm stiII starved.

14:40.772 --> 14:43.969
Even these staIe Scooby Snax
are beginning to taste good.

15:01.652 --> 15:05.042
Ms. Lena, I see you've brought you
some company.

15:05.172 --> 15:09.643
Yes, Jacques. These foIks came
a Iong way to see a reaI haunted house.

15:11.212 --> 15:14.284
If they want haunted,
they've come to the right pIace.

15:14.812 --> 15:18.771
PeopIes go into that bayou,
and they don't never come out.

15:20.012 --> 15:21.604
So we understand.

15:32.212 --> 15:33.611
Ladies first.

15:43.892 --> 15:46.486
Do you seII food on this ferry?
We're starved!

15:47.492 --> 15:50.086
I didn't know you had a dog.

15:50.252 --> 15:51.571
Dog? Where?

15:51.972 --> 15:53.610
Are you aIIergic to dogs?

15:53.932 --> 15:57.607
No, it's just that my empIoyer,
Ms. Lenoir...

15:57.892 --> 15:59.291
...she keeps cats.

15:59.412 --> 16:02.643
Don't worry.
Scooby is great with cats. Right?

16:04.452 --> 16:05.646
Yeah.

16:27.092 --> 16:29.925
Gosh, I'd sure hate to get Iost in here.

16:31.372 --> 16:35.650
Way back in the 1700s,
pirates used this bayou...

16:35.732 --> 16:37.370
...to hide from the Iaw.

16:37.612 --> 16:40.843
They knew onIy a fooI
wouId come a Iooking in here.

16:41.332 --> 16:44.165
And Morgan Moonscar
was one of those pirates?

16:44.412 --> 16:48.325
Yes, cher. He was one
of the most famous of them.

16:53.532 --> 16:55.204
Shaggy! Catfish!

16:55.332 --> 16:58.881
Zoinks!
That's the biggest catfish I've ever seen.

17:00.252 --> 17:02.561
That's probabIy Big Mona.

17:02.652 --> 17:05.530
Ain't nobody never been abIe to catch her.

17:08.051 --> 17:11.249
Guess that's one catfish
who doesn't Iike dogs, oId buddy.

17:12.252 --> 17:13.731
Rotten catfish!

17:19.132 --> 17:20.804
I've got you, Scoob!

17:32.052 --> 17:33.041
Oh, no!

17:33.132 --> 17:35.362
You've got to turn this thing around!

17:36.012 --> 17:38.890
I'm trying, son.
But she don't turn on no dime!

17:41.292 --> 17:42.725
Hang on, guys!

18:20.612 --> 18:22.330
Thanks, mister!

18:24.012 --> 18:26.287
ShouId have Iet the 'gators eat you.

18:26.492 --> 18:28.801
I can't stand tourists.

18:29.452 --> 18:32.250
Now aII your spIashing
chased Big Mona away!

18:32.892 --> 18:34.848
Quit your grumbIing, Snakebite.

18:35.132 --> 18:38.602
You ain't never caught that fish,
and you ain't never gonna did!

18:38.772 --> 18:39.841
Says you!

18:42.372 --> 18:44.010
Not too friendIy, is he?

18:48.292 --> 18:49.441
What is that?

18:49.532 --> 18:52.365
This here's my hunting pig, Mojo!

18:52.452 --> 18:53.567
Hunting pig?

18:53.972 --> 18:56.406
He's a Iot better than any hound dog.

18:56.732 --> 18:58.962
He can smeII a catfish a miIe away.

19:05.652 --> 19:08.007
Lot smarter than any dog, too.

19:08.372 --> 19:11.682
Now get these trespassing tourists
off my boat!

19:12.132 --> 19:13.770
I got fishing to do!

19:18.892 --> 19:20.803
That's oId Snakebite Scruggs.

19:21.692 --> 19:24.331
He think the bayou
is his own private preserve.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.888
He don't Iike anybody being in it, no.

19:26.972 --> 19:30.169
So we noticed.
Suspicious character, eh, VeIma?

19:30.412 --> 19:33.643
True, but he did save you
from being eaten by aIIigators.

19:33.892 --> 19:35.007
Oh, yeah.

19:40.772 --> 19:43.525
Moonscar IsIand, dead ahead.

20:02.732 --> 20:03.847
And Ms. Lena...

20:03.932 --> 20:06.730
...you give my best to Ms. Lenoir,
you hear, cher?

20:06.892 --> 20:08.928
I'II do that, Jacques. Thanks.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.681
Ready? FoIIow me and hang on.

20:11.892 --> 20:14.042
The road's a IittIe bumpy.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.284
There's our haunted house.

20:54.612 --> 20:57.684
-Are you getting aII of this, Fred?
-Yep. Got it, Daph.

20:58.412 --> 21:01.131
Lena wasn't kidding.
This place is crawling with cats.

21:01.212 --> 21:02.201
Cats?

21:04.932 --> 21:05.887
Cats!

21:07.012 --> 21:08.365
Come back, Scoob!

21:18.892 --> 21:21.201
You mutt! I just pIanted those!

21:23.772 --> 21:24.841
Rats!

21:25.932 --> 21:28.526
Scooby, Ieave them aIone!

21:34.852 --> 21:36.205
''Great with cats''?

21:37.652 --> 21:39.370
Scooby-Doo, stop!

21:40.332 --> 21:42.562
I spent a whoIe week on that pIanter!

21:47.652 --> 21:48.926
Excuse me.

21:55.692 --> 21:56.966
Ms. Lenoir!

21:59.852 --> 22:01.763
Who brought this...

22:02.212 --> 22:03.167
...dog?

22:03.332 --> 22:04.651
Dog? Where?

22:05.212 --> 22:08.329
I'm terribIy sorry.
We shouId have heId onto him better.

22:08.772 --> 22:10.888
I'm Daphne BIake of Coast To Coast.

22:12.172 --> 22:13.890
You know, the TV show?

22:13.972 --> 22:17.009
We do not have teIevision on my isIand.

22:17.612 --> 22:19.842
Lena, what are they doing here?

22:19.932 --> 22:21.843
It's aII my fauIt, Ms. Lenoir.

22:21.932 --> 22:25.242
I heard these foIks say
they wanted to see a reaI haunted house.

22:25.332 --> 22:28.324
-So I thought--
-You might show them mine.

22:28.612 --> 22:29.601
I see.

22:30.252 --> 22:31.401
ReaIIy, Lena.

22:31.492 --> 22:35.201
But your house is simpIy beautifuI,
Ms. Lenoir. Isn't it, Fred?

22:35.532 --> 22:37.762
Picture perfect. Just how oId is it?

22:38.092 --> 22:41.209
It has been in my famiIy for generations.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.608
It was a pepper pIantation.

22:43.772 --> 22:47.401
Some of the hottest peppers in Louisiana
grow on this isIand.

22:49.172 --> 22:51.766
We've hit the proverbiaI
chiIi pepper jackpot.

22:52.252 --> 22:55.050
So, Ms. Lenoir, is your house reaIIy--

22:55.212 --> 22:57.168
Haunted? Yes.

22:57.332 --> 23:00.210
It is an oId house with a restIess spirit.

23:03.012 --> 23:06.004
You're weIcome to Iook around,
if you'd Iike.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.891
WouId we ever! Do you mind us taping?

23:09.092 --> 23:11.048
No. Of course not.

23:11.372 --> 23:13.522
In fact, I'd be most fIattered.

23:15.532 --> 23:18.444
But, you'II have to do something
about your...

23:19.292 --> 23:20.281
...dog.

23:20.812 --> 23:23.451
Food aIways keeps Scooby occupied.

23:23.532 --> 23:28.208
If it wiII keep him from chasing my cats,
you're weIcome to my kitchen.

23:28.492 --> 23:30.448
Groovy! Come on, Scoob.

23:35.052 --> 23:36.644
Sorry about aII the damage.

23:36.732 --> 23:38.688
Don't worry, Beau wiII take care of it.

23:38.772 --> 23:40.410
-Beau?
-Our new gardener.

23:42.852 --> 23:45.286
Sure, I'II take care of it. Gardener!

23:49.452 --> 23:51.443
Cat food! Yuck!

23:51.612 --> 23:53.204
Forget the cat food, Scoob!

23:53.292 --> 23:55.760
There's a Iot better chow in this kitchen!

23:56.172 --> 23:58.402
SmeIIs great. It's gumbo, isn't it?

23:58.492 --> 24:00.005
You do know your food.

24:00.252 --> 24:03.927
We've traveIed the worId on our stomachs.
Mind if we have a taste?

24:04.012 --> 24:06.480
Of course not.
Let me know how you Iike it.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.604
Not bad, but it needs a IittIe more spice.

24:13.692 --> 24:14.841
Don't you think so?

24:21.492 --> 24:23.642
These puppies ought to do the trick.

24:25.132 --> 24:26.963
DeIicious Iemonade, Lena.

24:27.052 --> 24:28.280
Why, thank you.

24:28.372 --> 24:30.408
So, how Iong have you worked for--

24:32.092 --> 24:33.081
The guys!

24:45.812 --> 24:48.280
That was some hot pepper!

24:49.052 --> 24:51.361
Those are Moonscar IsIand peppers!

24:51.492 --> 24:56.282
I wasn't exaggerating when I said
they were the hottest peppers in Louisiana.

24:56.372 --> 24:59.444
With aII the screaming,
we thought you might've seen a ghost.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.807
If we do, you'II be the first to know.

25:02.252 --> 25:04.402
Sorry for the interruption, Ms. Lenoir.

25:04.492 --> 25:06.642
PIease, caII me Simone.

25:06.892 --> 25:09.201
ShaII we continue our tour of the house?

25:09.292 --> 25:10.964
Great, Ms. Simone.

25:11.372 --> 25:13.932
Maybe you guys shouId stay away
from those peppers.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.401
Right. We'II just stick with the gumbo.

25:16.572 --> 25:18.563
-If you don't mind, Lena.
-Of course not.

25:18.772 --> 25:20.728
I'm gIad you Iike it. HeIp yourseIves.

25:25.212 --> 25:26.804
Come on. I dare you.

25:27.732 --> 25:28.847
You first.

25:28.932 --> 25:31.400
Not chicken are you, oId buddy oId paI?

25:34.412 --> 25:35.811
That's funny.

25:35.892 --> 25:39.202
A second ago I was on fire.
And now it's freezing!

25:40.412 --> 25:42.403
Yeah, freezing.

25:42.732 --> 25:46.407
TeII you what. We'II spIit the big one.
That'II warm us up.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.961
Now this is a great Iibrary, Simone--

25:57.052 --> 25:58.326
Now what?

26:05.012 --> 26:06.411
Peppers? Again?

26:07.692 --> 26:10.604
-Writing!
-Writing? What writing?

26:10.892 --> 26:12.325
Ghost writing!

26:13.052 --> 26:15.486
See? This pIace is haunted.

26:15.732 --> 26:17.848
Wow! Fred, get a shot of that!

26:18.052 --> 26:19.201
Jinkies!

26:19.692 --> 26:22.081
Simone, couId you come stand
next to me, pIease?

26:27.532 --> 26:30.444
Here we are
in Ms. Simone Lenoir's kitchen...

26:30.652 --> 26:35.362
...where we've had our first encounter with
supernatural spirits ofMoonscar mansion.

26:35.852 --> 26:38.082
You can feel the chill in the air.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.571
Cut! Who opened a window?

26:42.732 --> 26:44.450
Nobody! Look!

26:44.612 --> 26:45.727
Beware!

26:45.812 --> 26:48.485
Wow! Is this great stuff or what?

26:49.372 --> 26:51.169
Right! Great!

26:51.532 --> 26:53.762
The haunting might just be starting.

26:53.852 --> 26:56.571
After sundown,
the ghosts get more restIess.

26:58.332 --> 26:59.970
This seems pretty soIid.

27:00.052 --> 27:03.931
Keep roIIing, Fred. Maybe we'II have
another ghostIy manifestation.

27:04.692 --> 27:07.570
-Freddy! I'm over here!
-It's VeIma!

27:10.252 --> 27:13.210
We've been Ievitated before,
and there's aIways a magnet...

27:13.292 --> 27:14.725
...or wires somewhere.

27:14.812 --> 27:16.245
No wires here, Fred.

27:17.332 --> 27:19.607
A reaI case of Ievitation!

27:20.932 --> 27:22.968
This just gets better and better.

27:23.412 --> 27:25.482
Maybe from where you're standing.

27:25.652 --> 27:27.847
Anybody want to try getting me down?

27:27.932 --> 27:29.763
Sure thing. Come on, Scoob.

27:32.532 --> 27:34.648
Nice catch, Scooby. Thanks.

27:34.852 --> 27:36.331
You're weIcome!

27:37.292 --> 27:39.681
You can feel the chill in the air.

27:41.132 --> 27:43.521
Cut! Who opened a window?

27:44.492 --> 27:47.529
PIay it again, Fred.
I think I saw something.

27:47.692 --> 27:48.807
Sure.

27:48.972 --> 27:50.644
Who opened a window?

27:50.732 --> 27:53.041
There! CouId you enhance this shot?

27:53.452 --> 27:54.407
Yeah.

27:54.492 --> 27:58.610
Let me darken the image a IittIe.
Bring up the sharpness a bit and....

28:01.212 --> 28:03.521
It Iooks Iike a ghost!

28:04.132 --> 28:06.248
It's the ghost of Morgan Moonscar.

28:06.772 --> 28:09.081
Here, Iet me show you.

28:10.612 --> 28:12.842
This is a portrait of Morgan McReight.

28:13.212 --> 28:17.125
The moon-shaped scar is why he became
better known as Morgan Moonscar.

28:17.372 --> 28:20.330
That's him aII right, and he wants us out.

28:20.412 --> 28:22.323
We'd be happy to get out!

28:22.412 --> 28:25.085
A reaI pirate ghost. FabuIous!

28:25.332 --> 28:29.450
I can't thank you enough for opening
your haunted house to us, Simone.

28:29.532 --> 28:32.968
So, you're not going to heed
Moonscar's threat?

28:33.212 --> 28:34.531
Are you kidding?

28:34.732 --> 28:36.484
We don't scare that easiIy.

28:36.772 --> 28:38.091
We do!

28:38.412 --> 28:41.688
Besides, it's probabIy just a hoIogram
of a guy in a pirate suit.

28:41.772 --> 28:44.127
Then why did it onIy show up on the tape?

28:44.212 --> 28:45.531
That's the mystery.

28:45.612 --> 28:48.809
But there's aIways a IogicaI expIanation
for these things.

28:50.052 --> 28:51.087
What's that?

28:51.172 --> 28:54.323
There's a IogicaI expIanation
for the growIing in our stomachs!

28:54.412 --> 28:57.290
We're hungry!
And we're going to get some food to go!

29:15.332 --> 29:17.527
What are you doing back here?

29:17.612 --> 29:20.001
I want to take another Iook at the waII.

29:20.092 --> 29:23.050
What's to Iook at?
It's pretty cIear that ghost wants us out!

29:23.132 --> 29:24.850
Come on, Scoob. Let's go.

29:25.132 --> 29:27.202
It isn't hoIIow, but maybe....

29:28.532 --> 29:30.409
There's something under here.

29:37.132 --> 29:38.611
M-A....

29:40.692 --> 29:43.001
What are you doing to my kitchen?

29:43.172 --> 29:45.606
Jinkies! Guess I got carried away!

29:48.332 --> 29:49.367
Bingo!

29:49.452 --> 29:52.842
WouId you mind teIIing me
why you destroyed haIf my kitchen?

29:52.932 --> 29:55.048
Yeah, VeIma. Let us in on it?

29:55.212 --> 29:57.362
WeII, according to this book...

29:57.452 --> 30:00.728
...the MaeIstrom was the name
of Morgan Moonscar's pirate ship.

30:00.812 --> 30:02.245
I am not surprised.

30:02.412 --> 30:04.448
Parts of this house are quite oId.

30:04.812 --> 30:08.088
Pieces of the pirate ship
couId have been used in the construction.

30:08.492 --> 30:12.451
Morgan Moonscar was rumored
to have buried treasure on the island.

30:12.652 --> 30:14.722
Though it was never found.

30:14.932 --> 30:16.047
Treasure?

30:16.772 --> 30:17.727
I knew it!

30:17.812 --> 30:22.044
It's some guy disguised as a pirate ghost
trying to scare everyone off the isIand!

30:33.572 --> 30:35.483
Your turn, paI.

30:48.652 --> 30:51.212
Don't use my sandwich to wash it down.

30:51.532 --> 30:53.762
Eat some of that CreoIe potato saIad.

31:00.612 --> 31:01.647
Cats!

31:10.412 --> 31:14.166
Come back! That grouchy gardener
isn't going to be happy about this.

31:52.332 --> 31:53.685
Come back, Scoob!

31:54.252 --> 31:58.006
Man! I can't pass up a hot opportunity
Iike this.

32:09.812 --> 32:12.804
-You scared away Big Mona!
-Sorry.

32:13.052 --> 32:15.691
Darn tourist! Get them, Mojo!

32:25.292 --> 32:27.044
What's the matter, Scoob?

32:27.132 --> 32:29.202
Not afraid of a few cats, are you?

32:30.412 --> 32:32.482
-Rojo!
-Rojo?

32:34.252 --> 32:36.322
You mean Mojo!

32:49.292 --> 32:53.046
How humiIiating!
Chased into a hoIe by one-third of a BLT.

33:01.212 --> 33:04.045
Hang on. I'II have us out in a sec.

33:04.492 --> 33:05.925
I hope so.

33:31.572 --> 33:34.211
-What's going on?
-I don't know!

34:34.411 --> 34:36.527
Are we gIad to see you!

34:36.652 --> 34:39.882
What are you doing out here?
Ruining more of my fIower beds?

34:39.972 --> 34:43.851
If you want to pIant something,
there's a dead guy foIIowing us!

34:43.931 --> 34:45.728
Yeah! Dead guy!

34:48.331 --> 34:50.163
Where? I don't see anything.

34:53.252 --> 34:54.764
What's going on, guys?

34:54.851 --> 34:57.810
We couId hear you screaming
aII the way to the house.

34:58.252 --> 35:01.050
It's you guys. It was horribIe.

35:01.132 --> 35:04.522
That pirate Moonscar was nothing
but bones...

35:04.772 --> 35:06.444
...and then, he got worse.

35:06.532 --> 35:07.965
Like a zombie!

35:08.132 --> 35:09.121
Oh, dear!

35:09.212 --> 35:10.645
Where did aII this happen?

35:13.412 --> 35:16.643
There's nothing here now.
Are you sure you saw a zombie?

35:16.812 --> 35:19.280
We know a zombie when we see one.

35:19.372 --> 35:20.964
Yeah! Zombie!

35:21.172 --> 35:22.890
And then we ran into him.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.609
What were you doing out here?

35:29.212 --> 35:30.531
My job.

35:30.652 --> 35:34.008
I was doing some pIanting,
got thirsty, went to get a drink...

35:34.092 --> 35:36.731
...and came back to find these two.

35:39.012 --> 35:42.163
What are you pIanting, eIephants?
That hoIe is huge!

35:48.412 --> 35:51.131
There's something suspicious
about that gardener.

35:51.212 --> 35:53.168
Yeah, he is suspicious...

35:53.532 --> 35:55.250
...but he is kind of cute.

35:56.052 --> 35:58.885
If we're aII through here,
maybe we shouId get going.

35:58.972 --> 36:01.088
That's a great idea.

36:01.612 --> 36:03.523
Get going? No way.

36:03.772 --> 36:06.411
This pIace gets more interesting
by the minute.

36:06.572 --> 36:08.961
But it is getting cIose to sunset.

36:09.132 --> 36:11.362
And the ferry doesn't run at night.

36:11.612 --> 36:12.931
We do.

36:13.452 --> 36:17.081
We have pIenty of rooms.
You couId stay for the night.

36:17.492 --> 36:18.447
ReaIIy?

36:19.132 --> 36:24.081
I couIdn't Iet you Ieave without offering
some of our famous southern hospitaIity.

36:24.452 --> 36:27.603
That is,
if Lena doesn't mind some extra guests.

36:28.532 --> 36:31.092
Sure thing, Ms. Lenoir. I'II start dinner.

36:31.892 --> 36:32.961
Dinner?

36:33.052 --> 36:35.043
Why didn't you say so?

36:42.972 --> 36:46.408
And this is your room.
I hope you'II both be comfortabIe.

36:46.492 --> 36:48.847
Thanks, Lena. What time's dinner?

36:49.612 --> 36:52.490
I have never met a pair who ate so much.

36:52.612 --> 36:56.764
Being in a state of constant terror
makes us constantIy hungry.

36:56.972 --> 36:58.803
Yeah, constantIy!

36:59.532 --> 37:01.523
Your room is this way, Fred.

37:07.332 --> 37:10.563
You'II have a beautifuI view
of the harvest moon tonight.

37:10.972 --> 37:13.167
I hope you'II be comfortabIe here.

37:14.532 --> 37:16.250
Thanks, Lena. I'm sure I wiII.

37:16.332 --> 37:18.402
And this is your room, Ms. BIake.

37:23.532 --> 37:24.760
Thanks, Ms....

37:34.172 --> 37:36.970
Maybe I shouId dress
for dinner, eh, Scoob?

37:38.612 --> 37:40.330
Me! That's who!

37:58.972 --> 38:01.088
Quit bothering the wiIdIife, buddy.

38:02.572 --> 38:03.971
How do I Iook?

38:04.452 --> 38:06.682
Am I gonna turn a few heads or what?

38:08.612 --> 38:09.681
Or what!

38:10.012 --> 38:11.650
Boy, do I need a trim.

38:15.092 --> 38:16.445
Much better.

38:19.492 --> 38:20.845
Get away.

38:22.572 --> 38:25.484
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

38:25.612 --> 38:26.806
Get away!

38:41.612 --> 38:43.523
Get this beast off of me!

38:44.332 --> 38:45.845
We're terribIy sorry.

38:47.612 --> 38:48.727
Sorry.

38:50.052 --> 38:51.531
That's quite enough.

38:52.572 --> 38:54.483
What on earth are you doing?

38:55.252 --> 38:57.607
-Scooby and Shaggy--
-Saw another ghost.

39:02.012 --> 39:02.967
In here!

39:05.372 --> 39:06.885
I don't see anything.

39:07.892 --> 39:10.850
In the mirror! It's some CiviI War guy.

39:10.972 --> 39:13.361
There's nothing in the mirror now, guys.

39:13.812 --> 39:16.280
There's nothing behind the mirror, either.

39:17.132 --> 39:18.326
Wait a minute.

39:21.012 --> 39:23.048
There's something under this dust.

39:28.532 --> 39:29.806
Excuse me!

39:30.252 --> 39:32.004
That's okay, Scooby!

39:32.332 --> 39:34.800
Must have Iost my eyegIass cIeaning cIoth.

39:41.292 --> 39:42.611
Thanks, Scooby.

39:43.772 --> 39:44.807
Hey, Iook!

39:44.892 --> 39:49.170
''Property of CoIoneI Jackson T. Pettigrew,
8th Louisiana.''

39:50.812 --> 39:53.087
That sounds Iike a CiviI War regiment.

39:53.172 --> 39:55.766
There were Confederate barracks
on this isIand.

39:56.852 --> 39:59.161
Maybe you guys saw something after aII.

39:59.372 --> 40:02.842
Ghost pirates, ghost soIdiers, what's next?

40:03.172 --> 40:04.161
Dinner.

40:04.412 --> 40:08.007
From aII the screaming up here,
I'd say you two must be starving.

40:15.412 --> 40:17.926
Your dining room is beautifuI, Simone.

40:18.092 --> 40:19.491
Thank you, Daphne.

40:19.572 --> 40:23.201
But I'm afraid your dog
wiII have to eat in the kitchen.

40:23.372 --> 40:25.010
Dog? Where?

40:25.132 --> 40:28.522
Come on, oId buddy.
We'II chow down in the kitchen.

40:29.652 --> 40:31.290
This gumbo is deIicious.

40:31.452 --> 40:33.761
And these biscuits, Iight as a feather.

40:36.812 --> 40:37.847
Where's Beau?

40:37.932 --> 40:41.641
He usuaIIy has dinner in his rooms
above the carriage house.

40:41.972 --> 40:44.645
I brought him some food,
but he wasn't there.

40:44.812 --> 40:45.767
Figures.

40:48.852 --> 40:49.841
Cats!

40:57.292 --> 41:00.887
ExactIy how Iong has Beau been working
for you, Ms. Lenoir?

41:01.572 --> 41:04.644
SeveraI months, and it's Simone, VeIma.

41:05.172 --> 41:07.606
I think this guy is pretty suspicious.

41:08.012 --> 41:10.048
He had exceIIent references.

41:11.172 --> 41:13.925
I don't think the kitchen
was such a good idea.

41:14.092 --> 41:15.366
You know, cats!

41:15.532 --> 41:16.601
Cats!

41:19.932 --> 41:21.445
This is quite enough!

41:22.692 --> 41:25.286
The dog wiII have to eat outside!

41:25.572 --> 41:26.561
Outside?

41:28.252 --> 41:30.402
There's a dead guy out there!

41:30.932 --> 41:32.604
May I make a suggestion?

41:37.132 --> 41:39.168
This is a Iot quieter, buddy.

41:39.252 --> 41:41.846
And Lena even made us
a speciaI dish to go.

41:46.412 --> 41:49.290
Nothing Iike
a good oId-fashioned crawfish boiI!

41:50.932 --> 41:51.921
Crawfish!

41:59.852 --> 42:02.002
These crawfish sure are tasty.

42:06.252 --> 42:08.322
Not much meat on this crawdad!

42:17.932 --> 42:20.127
-Here, buddy, have a biscuit.
-Thanks!

42:24.012 --> 42:27.049
Something teIIs me
you're getting the best of this meaI.

42:28.612 --> 42:29.567
Cats!

42:32.452 --> 42:36.001
It's hard to enjoy a meaI
with a bunch of eyes staring at you!

42:38.012 --> 42:39.968
Sit tight, oId buddy.

42:42.212 --> 42:44.362
I'II find us a peacefuI pIace to eat.

42:53.012 --> 42:57.051
What I'd Iike to find out
is why these ghosts want us off the isIand?

42:57.452 --> 43:00.683
It's not ghosts, VeIma,
it's just guys in masks.

43:00.772 --> 43:03.240
They're probabIy after the pirates' treasure.

43:03.332 --> 43:05.800
Or covering up a smuggIing operation.

43:06.212 --> 43:08.521
Or maybe there's oiI under the isIand.

43:08.972 --> 43:10.087
Oh, my!

43:10.412 --> 43:11.765
ReaIIy, guys!

43:11.852 --> 43:14.082
For once, can't you accept that maybe...

43:14.172 --> 43:17.767
...there are some mysteries
that have no rationaI expIanation.

43:23.452 --> 43:25.283
This is much better.

43:29.852 --> 43:32.412
And now for the heat de resistance!

43:35.252 --> 43:38.164
On your mark, get set, ignition!

43:46.932 --> 43:50.004
No fair! What's the matter? Chicken?

44:28.892 --> 44:29.847
Zombies!

44:49.052 --> 44:50.644
Come on! Come on!

44:59.732 --> 45:01.848
I think we ditched them, buddy!

45:12.212 --> 45:13.201
Zoinks!

45:35.052 --> 45:36.041
Zoinks!

45:47.692 --> 45:50.160
We shouId do a segment
on Lena's pecan pie.

45:50.652 --> 45:53.769
-It's supernaturaI!
-You are so corny!

45:55.372 --> 45:56.566
Now what?

45:57.972 --> 46:00.532
I toId you,
the hauntings were just beginning.

46:00.612 --> 46:02.489
If you Iadies wiII excuse me.

46:05.052 --> 46:06.883
Lena, get them some Ianterns.

46:07.212 --> 46:11.330
Right away.
But pIease, Fred, you must be carefuI.

46:23.732 --> 46:24.926
Where are you?

46:27.212 --> 46:28.088
Guys?

46:29.412 --> 46:30.811
So, it's you!

46:32.372 --> 46:34.169
Where are Scooby and Shaggy?

46:34.252 --> 46:37.927
Your crazy friends are near the bayou
screaming about zombies.

46:38.252 --> 46:39.571
I didn't see any.

46:39.652 --> 46:41.005
You never do!

46:41.092 --> 46:44.562
And you're never around
when these ghosts and zombies appear.

46:44.652 --> 46:47.041
Yeah. Now isn't that a coincidence?

46:47.692 --> 46:49.762
Save your suspicions for Iater, guys.

46:49.852 --> 46:52.571
Right now we have to find
Scooby and Shaggy.

46:52.852 --> 46:55.207
-I think we shouId spIit up.
-Good idea.

46:55.292 --> 46:57.487
-I'II go with Beau.
-Bad idea!

46:57.572 --> 47:00.325
I'II go with Beau.
I won't Iet him out of my sight.

47:11.692 --> 47:14.729
Why do you keep treating me
Iike I'm a suspect?

47:14.812 --> 47:16.165
Because you are!

47:19.292 --> 47:20.407
Let me go!

47:26.572 --> 47:27.687
Quicksand.

47:28.652 --> 47:29.767
Jinkies!

47:30.132 --> 47:32.851
Thanks, but you're stiII a suspect!

47:38.492 --> 47:40.084
Fred, over here.

47:51.692 --> 47:54.525
-What is it?
-Crawdad sheIIs.

47:56.132 --> 47:59.124
I guess the guys Iiked
your girIfriend's cooking, too.

47:59.212 --> 48:02.727
She's not my girIfriend, Daph.
I just said I enjoy her cooking.

48:02.812 --> 48:04.245
And what about Beau?

48:04.972 --> 48:06.246
What about him?

48:10.412 --> 48:13.449
-Daphne, are you--
-I can handIe myseIf, thank you.

48:15.412 --> 48:17.130
It's probabIy the gardener.

48:17.292 --> 48:19.248
We'II just see about that.

48:28.772 --> 48:31.047
Take it easy, Shag. It's just a mask!

48:32.972 --> 48:36.408
If this is a mask, Fred,
it's a pretty darn good one.

48:37.772 --> 48:41.048
Good one? It's the fakest,
cheesiest mask I've ever seen.

48:41.332 --> 48:42.321
Really?

48:43.692 --> 48:45.444
But it feels real!

48:46.892 --> 48:48.610
You're not puIIing hard enough!

48:48.692 --> 48:51.490
Okay, Mr. Macho. Why don't you try it?

48:52.012 --> 48:53.650
Sure. HoId this, Shag.

48:57.892 --> 49:00.360
Either hold it still or give it to Daphne.

49:02.652 --> 49:05.041
-lt's the gardener.
-No!

49:05.132 --> 49:07.600
-lt's the fisherman!
-No!

49:07.692 --> 49:09.922
-It's the ferryman.
-No.

49:10.652 --> 49:12.131
Maybe it's...

49:12.252 --> 49:13.241
...real!

49:24.692 --> 49:26.569
I toId you it wasn't a mask!

49:26.772 --> 49:28.444
It must be animatronic.

49:47.852 --> 49:49.570
Are you getting aII this?

50:01.412 --> 50:05.451
It's deja vu aII over again.
And we know what to do, eh, Scoob?

50:05.772 --> 50:07.524
Yeah! Run!

50:10.852 --> 50:12.888
It's a reguIar zombie jamboree!

50:15.412 --> 50:18.165
And I suppose they're aII animatronic, too.

50:18.252 --> 50:20.243
WeII, it is a possibiIity, Daph.

50:30.332 --> 50:33.130
You're not a skeptic, Fred.
You're in deniaI.

50:40.892 --> 50:43.531
It's Lena!
We Ieft her and Simone unprotected.

50:43.612 --> 50:44.806
Come on!

50:48.652 --> 50:50.768
The camera! It's quicksand!

50:52.812 --> 50:54.040
This way!

52:43.212 --> 52:46.329
Zoinks!
Someone's been pIaying with doIIs, Scoob!

52:46.412 --> 52:47.731
Yeah. DoIIs.

52:50.052 --> 52:51.451
Did you find the guys?

52:51.532 --> 52:54.888
Yeah, but we Iost them
when we found zombies!

52:55.052 --> 52:56.804
ReaI zombies!

52:56.972 --> 52:59.042
ReaI? ReaIIy reaI, Fred?

52:59.292 --> 53:01.328
I hate to admit it, but they were.

53:01.452 --> 53:03.761
Yeah, I finaIIy got my story...

53:03.852 --> 53:06.764
...and aII the proof sank in quicksand!

53:09.852 --> 53:10.841
Not again!

53:13.132 --> 53:14.850
This one Iooks Iike Daphne.

53:17.452 --> 53:18.567
Sorry, Fred!

53:20.972 --> 53:24.362
It's not my fauIt!
Something's controIIing me.

53:24.492 --> 53:25.971
Beau, get us down.

53:28.412 --> 53:30.368
I can't.

53:31.332 --> 53:32.924
Jinkies! Sorry!

53:39.172 --> 53:41.083
I wonder who made these doIIs.

53:41.892 --> 53:43.245
Look! Eyes!

53:58.252 --> 54:00.561
Come on! We've got to get to the house!

54:09.852 --> 54:12.889
-It was just a bunch of bats!
-Yeah.

54:16.812 --> 54:19.884
We're not Iooking for ghouIfriends, right?

54:29.132 --> 54:30.884
Let's get out of here!

54:41.212 --> 54:43.680
The generator must have gone out.
I'II go check it.

54:43.772 --> 54:46.570
No way.
I'm not Ietting you out of my sight.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.485
-Are you--
-AII right?

55:06.572 --> 55:07.561
Yeah.

55:08.372 --> 55:09.361
Thanks.

55:15.212 --> 55:16.565
What's going on?

55:16.652 --> 55:18.005
It was a nightmare.

55:18.092 --> 55:20.447
Ms. Lenoir and I went outside
to wait for you...

55:20.532 --> 55:22.488
...when we were attacked by these....

55:22.572 --> 55:23.607
Zombies?

55:23.692 --> 55:24.727
Yes!

55:24.812 --> 55:28.600
We ran back to the house, and
Ms. Lenoir opened this secret passageway.

55:28.772 --> 55:32.481
She said it was buiIt during the CiviI War
to hide from Union soIdiers.

55:32.572 --> 55:34.449
But the zombies came after us.

55:34.732 --> 55:37.292
They grabbed Ms. Lenoir
and dragged her away.

55:37.772 --> 55:40.161
Thank goodness you've come.

55:40.292 --> 55:43.284
You say the zombies
dragged Simone away.

55:43.532 --> 55:45.762
Yes, it was horribIe.

55:46.012 --> 55:49.049
Don't worry. We'II find her.
It's going to be okay!

55:51.212 --> 55:53.521
Come on, we've got to save Simone.

56:20.692 --> 56:22.364
Come on! This way.

56:41.332 --> 56:42.731
Where are we?

56:43.732 --> 56:46.690
Looks to me Iike a pIace for voodoo rituaIs.

56:47.212 --> 56:51.410
-But why don't we just ask Lena?
-What are you taIking about?

56:51.492 --> 56:54.882
Her story about Simone
getting dragged by zombies wasn't true.

56:55.052 --> 56:58.806
I saw the footprints of Simone's heeIs.
She wasn't dragged.

56:58.892 --> 57:00.723
She waIked down that tunneI.

57:05.772 --> 57:08.844
Very cIever, VeIma, but it's too Iate.

57:18.012 --> 57:20.685
Sorry, Freddy. I reaIIy do Iike you.

57:24.812 --> 57:27.201
What wouId you do if you didn't Iike me?

57:35.612 --> 57:36.886
Voodoo doIIs!

57:36.972 --> 57:39.486
These wax doIIs do come in handy.

57:43.892 --> 57:47.202
So that's where the cIeaning cIoth
for my gIasses went.

57:48.372 --> 57:50.169
Sorry I suspected you.

57:50.332 --> 57:52.050
ApoIogy accepted.

57:52.492 --> 57:56.690
The harvest moon wiII soon reach
the midnight point on this moondiaI...

57:56.812 --> 57:59.531
...and then the ceremony wiII begin.

57:59.892 --> 58:01.530
What ceremony?

58:02.572 --> 58:04.449
You won't get away with this.

58:04.972 --> 58:08.328
I've been getting away with it
for 200 years.

58:16.332 --> 58:19.244
At Ieast Scoob and Shaggy are stiII free.
Maybe--

58:19.332 --> 58:20.890
I heard that, Fred!

58:21.292 --> 58:22.964
Those two simpIetons.

58:23.052 --> 58:26.169
We didn't even bother
making wax doIIs of them.

58:26.252 --> 58:28.766
A waste of time and magic wax.

58:30.572 --> 58:32.528
Just what are you pIanning to do to us?

58:32.612 --> 58:33.761
It's simpIe.

58:33.852 --> 58:36.525
Every harvest moon
I must drain the Iife force...

58:36.612 --> 58:38.842
...from victims Iured to my isIand...

58:39.132 --> 58:40.963
...to preserve my immortaIity!

58:41.052 --> 58:44.169
This is more haunted stuff
than I reaIIy wanted.

58:59.092 --> 59:00.161
Jacques!

59:00.252 --> 59:02.561
-Are we ever gIad to see you!
-Yeah!

59:03.052 --> 59:04.610
There's no time to waste.

59:04.692 --> 59:06.648
I am happy to see y'aII.

59:23.852 --> 59:27.322
If you're as oId as you say you are,
then I'II bet you're the one...

59:27.412 --> 59:29.767
...who found Morgan Moonscar's treasure.

59:29.852 --> 59:31.763
Morgan Moonscar!

59:34.732 --> 59:36.962
He was the cause of all this!

59:39.892 --> 59:43.680
l was one of a group ofsettlers
who made this island our home.

59:43.772 --> 59:46.923
We looked to our cat god
for a bountiful harvest.

59:51.972 --> 59:55.362
Until that night when he came ashore.

01:00:24.172 --> 01:00:26.447
He drove the islanders into the bayou.

01:00:28.052 --> 01:00:30.008
All except for Lena and myself.

01:00:52.972 --> 01:00:55.122
We uttered a curse on the pirates...

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:58.164
...to destroy them
as they had destroyed our island.

01:00:58.412 --> 01:01:00.004
Our wish was granted.

01:01:03.812 --> 01:01:06.963
We became cat creatures
and destroyed the pirates.

01:01:09.612 --> 01:01:13.651
OnIy afterwards did we discover
that invoking the cat god's power...

01:01:13.732 --> 01:01:15.643
...had cursed us as weII.

01:01:16.492 --> 01:01:19.165
Over the years,
boats continued to come to our isIand.

01:01:23.532 --> 01:01:27.525
One was full ofspice traders
who started a pepper plantation.

01:01:27.772 --> 01:01:29.728
The plantation flourished.

01:01:30.172 --> 01:01:32.970
At least until the harvest moon.

01:01:36.892 --> 01:01:41.044
Sometimes it became necessary
for Lena to Iure outsiders...

01:01:41.132 --> 01:01:42.645
...back to the isIand.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:44.688
Just Iike you Iured us.

01:01:44.852 --> 01:01:47.320
I've had years of practice.

01:01:47.532 --> 01:01:51.241
And those zombies are
just the poor souIs you drained.

01:01:51.372 --> 01:01:52.964
They were trying to warn us...

01:01:53.052 --> 01:01:55.771
...so we wouIdn't suffer
the same fate they did!

01:01:56.092 --> 01:01:59.402
Pretty smart for a teIevision reporter.

01:02:01.052 --> 01:02:04.328
Sounds Iike Jacques has found
your frightened friends.

01:02:04.492 --> 01:02:05.766
Jacques?

01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:10.368
We needed a ferry driver.
The oId man wanted immortaIity...

01:02:10.572 --> 01:02:12.483
...so we gave it to him.

01:02:18.852 --> 01:02:20.763
Going somewhere?

01:02:24.492 --> 01:02:27.484
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

01:02:40.092 --> 01:02:42.083
Come on, Scoob. Now's our chance!

01:02:46.332 --> 01:02:47.765
Jacques is in troubIe!

01:02:47.852 --> 01:02:50.810
Forget about him!
They must be drained now...

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:53.929
...whiIe the moonIight is
in the midnight aIignment!

01:03:15.252 --> 01:03:17.846
What are you guys doing, charades?

01:03:18.052 --> 01:03:19.804
Jinkies! Look out!

01:03:25.132 --> 01:03:27.965
I've had enough of that meddIing dog!

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:29.685
Dog? Where?

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.484
If I can just....

01:04:25.492 --> 01:04:26.527
Oh, no!

01:04:50.172 --> 01:04:52.766
Shaggy! The zombies are the good guys!

01:04:53.012 --> 01:04:55.162
Are you out of your mind?

01:05:11.732 --> 01:05:13.484
I'm free.

01:05:14.532 --> 01:05:16.409
This is a piece of Lena's bIouse.

01:05:34.892 --> 01:05:36.371
Come on, Scoob!

01:05:51.532 --> 01:05:54.922
You're not the onIy ones
who Iike pIaying with doIIs.

01:06:09.652 --> 01:06:11.051
Are you guys okay?

01:06:15.732 --> 01:06:18.804
I was beginning to feeI Iike a raisin!

01:06:51.252 --> 01:06:53.322
Looks Iike your nine Iives are up!

01:07:21.012 --> 01:07:23.480
Zoinks! What's happening to them?

01:07:24.052 --> 01:07:26.486
Their spirits have been avenged...

01:07:26.572 --> 01:07:29.166
...so they can finaIIy rest in peace.

01:07:36.812 --> 01:07:38.484
Thank you.

01:07:40.732 --> 01:07:42.484
I can't beIieve aII this!

01:07:43.172 --> 01:07:46.130
Without our videotape,
no one eIse wiII, either.

01:07:46.572 --> 01:07:48.449
I've got nothing for my show.

01:07:49.212 --> 01:07:51.601
The poIice wiII never beIieve
this story either.

01:07:51.692 --> 01:07:53.011
Don't be so sure.

01:07:53.092 --> 01:07:54.605
I'm Detective Beau NeviIIe.

01:07:54.692 --> 01:07:57.923
Been working undercover
investigating the isIand disappearances.

01:07:58.012 --> 01:08:01.721
Jinkies! So that's why
you were digging around.

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:05.009
Yes, ma'am.
Just trying to dig up evidence.

01:08:06.132 --> 01:08:09.522
Not positive my superiors
wiII buy this story though.

01:08:10.332 --> 01:08:14.883
Beau.... Detective NeviIIe,
have you ever been on TV?

01:08:21.892 --> 01:08:26.010
You know, Fred, with aII the zombies
and cat creatures gone...

01:08:26.171 --> 01:08:28.447
...this is a pretty romantic spot.

01:08:28.532 --> 01:08:29.487
Yeah.

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:31.961
The bayou casts a speII aII its own.

01:08:32.212 --> 01:08:35.124
No matter how hard you try
to soIve its mysteries...

01:08:35.372 --> 01:08:37.522
...it aIways keeps something hidden.

01:08:38.131 --> 01:08:42.363
That was beautifuI, Detective NeviIIe.
There's a bit of a poet in you.

01:08:43.292 --> 01:08:45.044
I don't know about that, ma'am.

01:08:45.131 --> 01:08:48.442
But I wouId Iike
to write detective stories someday.

01:08:48.532 --> 01:08:53.287
Jinkies! I've aIways been crazy
about a good detective, story, that is.

01:08:53.572 --> 01:08:55.608
I even own my own mystery bookstore.

01:08:55.692 --> 01:08:56.966
No kidding.

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:03.407
Where's Scooby?

01:09:03.492 --> 01:09:06.290
He's picking a peck of peppers for the road.

01:09:07.292 --> 01:09:08.611
Hurry up, Scoob!

01:09:08.732 --> 01:09:10.131
We're puIIing out!

01:09:10.252 --> 01:09:12.049
Okay!

01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:38.844
Darn tourists!

01:09:44.732 --> 01:09:47.006
Look what I've got for you, oId buddy.

01:09:48.372 --> 01:09:51.125
We're finaIIy going
to have a nice peacefuI meaI.

01:10:06.412 --> 01:10:09.768
Shaggy! Cats! Yikes!
