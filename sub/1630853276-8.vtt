Previously on
"Billy The Kid"...

00:04.395 --> 00:06.397
This guy Murphy, he owns
a big store in Lincoln.

00:06.528 --> 00:07.790
[Baker] They got a company
called The House,

00:07.920 --> 00:09.313
and they run it out
of Murphy's store.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.011
Well, Billy, I want to
say it is a great honor

00:11.141 --> 00:12.838
to finally meet you
in the flesh. Great honor.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.492
My partners here,

00:14.623 --> 00:17.321
-Johnny Riley, Jim Dolan.
-The Santa Fe Ring run

00:17.452 --> 00:19.019
most things
out here in the West, Billy.

00:19.149 --> 00:22.283
They are secret societies
of wealthy people.

00:22.413 --> 00:23.893
An important aspect
to your work will be

00:24.024 --> 00:26.417
to enforce
our business interests.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.419
[Riley] This fellow Tunstall,
you may have seen his new store

00:28.550 --> 00:29.812
down at the end of the street.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.901
You see, what you need
to understand here

00:32.032 --> 00:34.164
is that this is my kingdom.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let

00:34.295 --> 00:35.905
some prick Englishman

00:36.036 --> 00:38.081
take it away from me as long
as you're around, Billy.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.301
[Jesse] We don't wanna see you
within five miles

00:40.431 --> 00:42.520
of our cattle
or our grain stores.

00:42.651 --> 00:45.567
Mr. Tunstall's got legitimate
business interests here.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.525
[Charlie] We're on the verge
of a big war.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.571
A war between Murphy
and Tunstall.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.399
Billy. I would like
to introduce you to my wife.

00:51.529 --> 00:53.053
This is Irene.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.229
It sure is nice to meet
such a handsome outlaw.

00:55.359 --> 00:56.752
See, everyone here,

00:56.882 --> 00:58.406
they want to see
what you can do with a gun.

00:58.536 --> 00:59.407
We expect you to do it.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.065
[Billy] Charlie, who is that?

01:05.195 --> 01:08.242
[Charlie] Her name is
SeÃ±orita Dulcinea del Tobosco.

01:08.372 --> 01:13.899
[speaking Spanish]

01:14.030 --> 01:17.512
These Mexican farmers think
we won't do anything

01:17.642 --> 01:18.991
about them breakin' our deals.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.037
You need to show them
that we mean business.

01:21.168 --> 01:22.778
Mr. Murphy wants you to stop
selling grain

01:22.908 --> 01:24.693
to Tunstall, right now.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.651
This is my home.
I will never leave!

01:26.782 --> 01:28.871
-[cries]
-[woman] No! No!

01:29.001 --> 01:33.093

01:33.223 --> 01:35.486
Sheriff Brady, he wants
to talk to Pat Garrett.

01:35.617 --> 01:38.054
What about the people here?
They're screaming for justice.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.664
Maybe he goes go away
for a while.

01:39.795 --> 01:42.624
Comes back over to your side
as a lawman.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.061
[Riley] We've heard rumors
that Tunstall has hired McSween,

01:45.192 --> 01:47.150
the lawyer that used
to work for you.

01:47.281 --> 01:50.936
I agree to meet with McSween,
it has to be in secret.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.764
A great pleasure to meet you.

01:52.895 --> 01:56.116
Unfortunately, I discovered
that Murphy himself was a crook.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.813
But after tonight,
your whole life will change.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.858
This is the time and place

01:59.989 --> 02:03.514
you have waited for
all your life.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.959
[crickets chirping]

02:14.090 --> 02:16.832
We've all heard quite
a bit about you, Billy.

02:16.962 --> 02:20.531
But the main thing from
our point of view, that is...

02:20.662 --> 02:23.969
myself and my partner,
John Tunstall,

02:24.100 --> 02:26.407
is, of course, that you work
for Mr. Murphy

02:26.537 --> 02:30.933
and The House.

02:31.063 --> 02:32.456
As you undoubtedly know,

02:32.587 --> 02:35.677
we are commercial rivals
of Mr. Murphy's.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.461
[sets glass down]

02:37.592 --> 02:38.680
Have you ever heard
of the Rings, Billy?

02:38.810 --> 02:41.552
Especially the Santa Fe Ring?

02:41.683 --> 02:43.859
As a matter of fact, I have.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.643
A journalist named Ash Upson
told me about 'em

02:45.774 --> 02:47.428
a few years ago.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.081
The Rings take different forms.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.909
Here in New Mexico,
the Rings concentrate

02:51.040 --> 02:52.781
on amassing huge landholdings

02:52.911 --> 02:55.000
through the manipulation
of Spanish land grants.

02:55.131 --> 02:57.612
That's where Murphy comes in.

02:57.742 --> 03:00.528
Precisely. He's been here long
enough to control

03:00.658 --> 03:05.010
the local Republican Party,
the election of judges,

03:05.141 --> 03:07.665
sheriffs, district attorneys,
territorial governors,

03:07.796 --> 03:09.667
you name it.

03:09.798 --> 03:12.061
And that is what Mr. Tunstall
wants to challenge.

03:12.192 --> 03:16.370
I don't see how Mr. Tunstall
could challenge any of that,

03:16.500 --> 03:17.806
even if he wanted to.

03:17.936 --> 03:21.810
Well, Mr. Tunstall is
an Englishman,

03:21.940 --> 03:23.899
an outsider.

03:24.029 --> 03:28.208
He has private wealth,
and he doesn't need the Ring.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.906
He purchased a big range,
between 3,000 and 4,000 acres,

03:31.036 --> 03:33.082
and he's been stocking it.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.823
That's what we're doing, Billy.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.608
Building a business,
so that we can deal honestly

03:37.739 --> 03:39.610
and fairly
with the farmers out here.

03:41.786 --> 03:44.615
I think Mr. Upson would
approve of that.

03:44.746 --> 03:45.877
If he's someone who cares
about justice

03:46.008 --> 03:48.445
in this part of the world,
then I'm certain

03:48.576 --> 03:50.665
he would also approve
of Mr. Tunstall.

but they are training me up

04:02.677 --> 04:04.679

It's the only way they can
keep me out of jail.

Everybody laughs about it.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.295
But watch out, William Bonney.

your friend, Pat Garrett."

Is Garrett for real?

04:26.483 --> 04:29.921
[chuckles]

04:36.972 --> 04:39.540
Hey, Jesse,
what do you think of Murphy?

04:39.670 --> 04:42.107
Oh, I don't know.
He's, uh, rich, I guess.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.805
He gets what he wants.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.811
You think he plays fair?

04:49.941 --> 04:51.203
You know, with all the farmers?

04:51.334 --> 04:52.814
Oh, you mean
the Mexican farmers?

04:52.944 --> 04:54.946
No. I mean all
the small farmers.

04:55.077 --> 04:59.037
Seems like he owns them.

04:59.168 --> 05:02.302
And this Englishman, Tunstall,
I think he's fair competition.

05:06.218 --> 05:09.396
How come you know so much
about Tunstall?

05:13.922 --> 05:16.577
You hear things.

05:21.669 --> 05:22.931
And I don't like
Murphy's henchmen.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.849
I don't like them either, Billy.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.939
But, uh, I'm not being paid
to like them.

05:34.334 --> 05:38.338
I don't see that there's much
justice in the world.

05:38.468 --> 05:42.211
I figure that's just the way
that things are,

05:42.342 --> 05:43.778
the way they've always been.

05:43.908 --> 05:47.477
What if you could change that?

05:47.608 --> 05:50.088
By doing what, exactly?

05:50.219 --> 05:53.614
I don't know. I'm just thinking.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.659
As far as I can see,
Murphy's a crook.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.053

05:58.183 --> 06:00.925
What if he didn't run things?

Well, then you and I...

Get some sleep, will you?

06:13.634 --> 06:16.637
Be careful.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.262
Gentlemen.

07:17.393 --> 07:20.788
Welcome to our regular meeting.

07:20.918 --> 07:24.313
Today we want to discuss some
new business we have for you.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.708
As you know, some of
the farmers down on the Bonito

07:27.838 --> 07:31.059
and the Hondo have broken
their contracts with us,

07:31.189 --> 07:34.802
therefore forfeiting
their rights to their farms.

07:34.932 --> 07:38.240
Now, I've just returned from
a business trip to Santa Fe,

07:38.370 --> 07:40.851
and I found a number
of investors both willing

07:40.982 --> 07:43.724
and eager to buy
those properties.

07:43.854 --> 07:49.425
These current occupiers,
now in default,

07:49.556 --> 07:52.080
they need to be
driven off the farms.

07:52.210 --> 07:56.345
So, here's a list of them
and where you can find them.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.826
Don't use unnecessary force.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.044
But on the other hand,

08:00.175 --> 08:02.394
we do expect you
to do your jobs.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.962
This is a perfectly legal
operation.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.835
These people have no right
to remain on our land.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.880
[Dolan] Boys, uh...

08:10.011 --> 08:13.057
Well, you decide how you're
going to handle it, right?

08:13.188 --> 08:14.929
It's nothing to us.

08:15.059 --> 08:18.106
Now, Major Murphy's throwing
a party this evening,

08:18.236 --> 08:20.195
and he'd like you all to attend.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.937
It's a request he's made.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.330
I hope you all find yourselves
able to oblige.

[Jesse] Come on, boys! Yah!

21:25.284 --> 21:29.505
Your lawyer, Mr. McSween,
told me about your ambitions.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.986
Want to start a business
to rival The House.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.902
Well, I realize that a lot
of what goes on here,

21:35.032 --> 21:39.776
in Lincoln County, especially,
is rather up for grabs.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.779
And, frankly, I plan to grab
every bit of land I can,

21:42.910 --> 21:45.216
for as little as possible.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.131
Can't fault you for that,
Mr. Tunstall.

21:47.262 --> 21:50.265
Please, call me John.

21:50.396 --> 21:54.487
And, if I may,
I shall call you Billy.

21:54.617 --> 21:57.664
[sets glass down]

21:57.794 --> 21:59.622
That's all right by me.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.885
The fact is, Billy,
John is prepared

22:02.016 --> 22:04.627
to pay us farmers fairly,
whatever we produce.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.629
That's true.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.588
I think Murphy is exploiting
his position here,

22:08.718 --> 22:09.937
forcing the farmers into debt,

22:10.067 --> 22:11.721
and then forcing them
off their lands.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.680
Now, I don't intend to do that.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.812
But John and all of us
are aware that Murphy

22:15.943 --> 22:18.467
isn't gonna let go of
his position without a fight.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.339
He's got a lot of guns.

22:26.997 --> 22:30.000
I noticed your lawyer,
McSween...

22:30.131 --> 22:32.786
a very religious man.

22:32.916 --> 22:35.005
He is.

22:35.136 --> 22:40.010
He has his faith,
and he has his principles.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.012
He's a very unusual man
for around here.

22:42.143 --> 22:47.061
What about you, John?

22:47.191 --> 22:48.628
What are your principles?

22:54.721 --> 22:57.288
"To thine own self be true.

22:57.419 --> 23:01.858
And it must follow
as night the day."

23:01.989 --> 23:03.599
[men] Hyah, hyah!

"Thou cannot be false
to any man."

23:18.179 --> 23:22.183

23:22.313 --> 23:24.054
What are you doing
on this land?

23:24.185 --> 23:26.143
This is our land.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.058
Oh, no, no.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.931
Not anymore it's not.

-Whoo!
-[horse whinnies]

23:36.676 --> 23:41.245
Billy...

23:41.376 --> 23:43.465
I would regard it as
a great honor if you would

23:43.596 --> 23:46.860
consider leaving Murphy's
employment and joining mine.

23:46.990 --> 23:50.037
I realize I'm asking you
a great deal.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.735
You must be working
with good friends,

23:52.866 --> 23:54.955
being very well remunerated
by The House,

23:55.085 --> 23:58.828
and I doubt I can offer you
as much.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.918
On the other hand, I think
I canoffer you something

24:02.049 --> 24:06.227
that is perhaps more important
than money.

24:06.357 --> 24:09.186
I want to run
a legitimate business.

24:09.317 --> 24:13.756
I'm not a crook, like Murphy.

24:13.887 --> 24:18.152
Now, I know in certain places
you're wanted for murder,

24:18.282 --> 24:22.722
and in those places,
there's a bounty on your head.

24:22.852 --> 24:28.379
Even so, I am willing
and happy to take you on.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.947
If you go straight,
and you work hard,

24:31.078 --> 24:34.342
both of which I believe
you're very capable of,

24:34.473 --> 24:37.650
in due course, I will petition
the governor on your behalf.

24:41.262 --> 24:45.179
A very big offer to make,
Mr. Tunstall...

24:45.309 --> 24:47.747
especially for someone
you don't know from Adam.

24:47.877 --> 24:50.053
I know.

24:50.184 --> 24:53.753
I believe,
and Charlie here also believes,

24:53.883 --> 24:56.886
that you are trustworthy...

24:57.017 --> 24:57.974
and honest.

25:00.760 --> 25:05.939
Whatever your reputation.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.158
If I switch sides,
there'll be consequences.

25:10.552 --> 25:14.208
I just needed to say
what I've said.

25:14.338 --> 25:17.080
This is a big undertaking.

25:17.211 --> 25:19.126
I would really like you
to be a part of it.

25:32.269 --> 25:35.011
How much for one

25:35.142 --> 25:37.971
It's all right.
We ain't gonna hurt ya.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.408
[Beckwith] Come on.
Toss one over here.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.018

25:44.847 --> 25:46.719
Oh, yeah.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.554
Whoo!

25:55.684 --> 25:57.773
Come on, boy, run.
You gotta go faster than that.

-He's running.
-Look at that.

26:27.368 --> 26:28.717
[driver] Whoa.

26:41.425 --> 26:43.471
This is cold-blooded murder.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.909
I'll send someone out to
Sheriff Brady to report it.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.259
We know exactly
who's behind this.

26:49.390 --> 26:52.219
No doubt about it.

26:52.349 --> 26:55.352
Seems like Murphy's
gotten desperate.

26:55.483 --> 26:56.310
[Tunstall]
You think Sheriff Brady

26:56.440 --> 26:57.746
will do anything about this?

26:57.877 --> 27:01.924
I can't say.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.839
He's an honored war veteran
and a good sheriff,

27:03.970 --> 27:04.884
all things considered.

27:05.014 --> 27:09.366
But?

27:09.497 --> 27:15.416
But he's also had a long-time
friendship with Major Murphy.

27:15.546 --> 27:16.330
I think that answers
my question.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.287
[sighs]

27:22.249 --> 27:24.773
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Hudgens.

27:27.689 --> 27:32.302
I will get their bodies
back to town.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.217
You and your daughter can
come over to my house

27:34.348 --> 27:36.437
and stay with me until
the funerals if it suits you.

27:36.567 --> 27:40.789
[voice breaking]
Thank you, Mr. Tunstall.

Hey, hey!

28:03.594 --> 28:06.032
Missed all the fun today,
Billy.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.468
[Billy] Yeah, what kind of fun?

28:07.598 --> 28:09.905
Well, we did what Mr. Murphy
wanted us to do.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.081
We drove those farmers off
their property.

28:12.212 --> 28:15.171
-Billy!
-Hell, yeah, we did.

28:15.302 --> 28:18.218
You kill any of them?

28:18.348 --> 28:22.004
What do you think?
'Course we did.

28:22.135 --> 28:24.224
Some of those fuckers
fired back at us.

28:24.354 --> 28:25.965
Shot and killed Arly.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.839
How many did you kill?

28:30.970 --> 28:33.320
Oh, I don't know.

Now, why do you care
about those farmers so? Huh?

Is that it?

-Glad you had fun.

Oh, yeah, it was real fun,
Billy.

How's that arm of yours, Jim?

29:31.508 --> 29:33.380
Pretty good.
Thank you, Sheriff.

29:33.510 --> 29:35.512
It's a shame when a woman
like that goes off the rails.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.347
As Sheriff of Lincoln County,

29:44.478 --> 29:46.349
I want to open this inquiry
into the deaths

29:46.480 --> 29:51.354
of 14 persons by firearms
in this county.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.922
Who wants to speak to
the violators of these crimes?

29:54.053 --> 29:56.055
Well, I do, Sheriff.

29:56.185 --> 29:58.057
I'm a lawyer acting
for Mr. John Tunstall,

29:58.187 --> 30:00.407
and we have already registered
that Major Murphy

30:00.537 --> 30:03.018
has openly declared war
on my client.

30:03.149 --> 30:04.759
Sheriff, you don't have
to listen

30:04.890 --> 30:07.109
to this Santa Fe law-speak.
All right?

30:07.240 --> 30:09.459
We don't need lawyers
in Lincoln County.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.200
We're perfectly capable
of sorting out our difficulties

30:11.331 --> 30:13.159
all by ourselves.

30:13.289 --> 30:15.248
Mr. Dolan, the law has to be
respected at all times.

30:15.378 --> 30:18.468
No one can run roughshod
over it.

30:18.599 --> 30:20.993
Do you have any idea why
these people were killed?

30:21.123 --> 30:23.647
No, sir.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.606
These killings,
they were nothing to do

30:25.736 --> 30:27.608
with The House
or Mr. Murphy personally.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.610
He was just as shocked
as everyone else

30:29.740 --> 30:31.568
to hear about them.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.527
Major Murphy is
an interested party.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.616
It's obvious that he wanted
these farmers and their families

30:35.746 --> 30:37.531
run off the land,
one way or another.

30:37.661 --> 30:40.708
They were random shootings
by persons unknown.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.624
Probably some criminal gang just
passing through Lincoln County.

30:43.754 --> 30:46.453
There is indeed a criminal gang
operating inside Lincoln County,

30:46.583 --> 30:48.194
and it's our contention that
The House pays them

30:48.324 --> 30:49.456
for their services.

30:49.586 --> 30:52.285
You got any proof there,
Mr. McSween?

30:52.415 --> 30:54.896
Hmm?

30:55.027 --> 30:55.984
Not yet.

30:56.115 --> 30:58.291
[scoffs] Yeah.

30:58.421 --> 30:59.988
Do you think you should get
Colonel Dudley up at the fort

31:00.119 --> 31:01.337
involved in this, Sheriff?

31:01.468 --> 31:03.557
No, I do not.

31:03.687 --> 31:06.081
This is a civil matter,
and before I do anything else,

31:06.212 --> 31:07.517
my deputies and I
will make inquiries

31:07.648 --> 31:11.086
to determine the facts.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.566
Thank you for your time,
gentlemen.

31:47.514 --> 31:50.169
I understand, SeÃ±or Baca.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.693
It's a terrible crime.
Terrible crime.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.268
We're friends, right?

32:02.398 --> 32:04.487
Claro.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.359
I've always told you
the truth, yes?

32:06.489 --> 32:08.230
SÃ­.

32:08.361 --> 32:11.581
Men who killed Chavez y Chavez's
sons were hired

32:11.712 --> 32:15.107
by the Englishman,
John Tunstall.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.935
Do you know who that is?

32:17.065 --> 32:19.459
SÃ­,I know who he is,
but I never thought--

32:19.589 --> 32:22.723
Now, he's trying to drive me
out of business.

32:22.853 --> 32:25.987
Which is...
It's gonna affect you.

32:26.118 --> 32:28.555
Because you and me, we have
a business together, no?

32:28.685 --> 32:30.731
SÃ­.

32:30.861 --> 32:33.734
You want to keep it
that way, yes?

32:33.864 --> 32:35.997
SÃ­.

32:36.128 --> 32:39.566
So we don't want any trouble
with any of your people.

32:39.696 --> 32:42.612
No trouble.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.788
So, what I want you to do is,
I want you to tell everyone

32:44.919 --> 32:46.921
that those shootings had
nothing to do with me,

32:47.052 --> 32:52.492
they had everything to do
with the Englishman.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.320
Will you do that for me?

We'll send flowers
to the funeral.

Those poor boys.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.433
Why do things have to be like
this these days, my old friend?

33:20.563 --> 33:22.217
Why?

33:22.348 --> 33:27.179
I agree. [clears throat]

so peaceful here.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.586
And it'll be
a beautiful place again.

Believe me, my friend.

up there, Billy?

34:27.804 --> 34:34.550
You are just like one
of those stars.

34:34.681 --> 34:40.904
You can burn so bright.

Those are bright,

I just wanted
to introduce myself.

36:14.084 --> 36:15.869
Well, that is not
a very good reason

36:15.999 --> 36:18.567
to ambush someone in the street.

36:18.698 --> 36:20.047
Do you have another motive?

I'd like to see you again.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.705
Why?

You're annoying the SeÃ±orita.

Gentlemen.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.660
There is little doubt
we are now as good

37:51.791 --> 37:55.011
as at war with Major Murphy
and The House.

37:55.142 --> 37:57.013
So far, in this
commercial conflict,

37:57.144 --> 37:58.928
the law has not been
on our side.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.103
I think we all know
the reason for that.

38:00.234 --> 38:03.585
Yes. The Rings.

38:03.716 --> 38:05.848
Murphy has powerful friends
in important places,

38:05.979 --> 38:08.677
but that doesn't mean
he isn't vulnerable.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.810
His business is failing,
partly through our own efforts.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.812
It's really a house of cards.

38:12.942 --> 38:14.030
You take away a couple
of the bottom cards,

38:14.161 --> 38:15.902
the whole house starts to fall.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.774
We can take them to court
for their illegal activities.

The way they cheat the army
with their beef rations,

38:21.081 --> 38:23.562

to their farmers.

38:23.692 --> 38:25.607
I'm already preparing
the papers,

38:25.738 --> 38:28.393
but there's no point
going to court in Santa Fe.

38:28.523 --> 38:32.658
The head of the Santa Fe Ring
is a man called Thomas Catron,

38:32.788 --> 38:35.530
and he turns out to be
a good friend of Major Murphy.

38:35.661 --> 38:39.012
Meanwhile, The House is
hiring more guns.

38:39.142 --> 38:41.057
I'm afraid that's true.

38:41.188 --> 38:43.146
I've heard of the recruitment
of another six sharp-shooters,

38:43.277 --> 38:46.019
joining those already
in Murphy's employ.

38:46.149 --> 38:49.805
This war is never going to be
won just in the courts.

38:52.025 --> 38:56.159
No.

38:56.290 --> 38:59.815
The truth is,
all our lives are at risk.

38:59.946 --> 39:02.557
If we are to fight this war,

39:02.688 --> 39:04.690
more blood will be spilled.

39:04.820 --> 39:09.129
We'll hire more guns ourselves.

39:09.259 --> 39:12.785
But we'll need an advantage
to survive this.
