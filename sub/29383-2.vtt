00:53.821 --> 00:55.756
Hello?

00:57.291 --> 00:59.293
Anyone here?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.932
I...

01:04.965 --> 01:07.201
I'm looking
for Margaret Booth.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.536
(gasps)

01:08.569 --> 01:10.938
You weren't going to snoop
in my bedroom, were you?

01:10.971 --> 01:12.940
No, of course not.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.543
Ms. Booth,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.611
I've been trying to call, but
I keep getting a busy signal.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.280
Well, that's funny.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.315
Who are you?
What's so important

01:21.349 --> 01:23.217
that you had to come
see me in person?

01:23.251 --> 01:24.618
My name is Karen Hopple.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.155
I'm chief of psychology
at Red Meadows Asylum.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.857
Benjamin Richter has escaped.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.493
You may remember him
as Mister...

01:32.526 --> 01:34.128
No, I know exactly who he is.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.964
Mr. Jingles is the reason
I opened this camp.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.932
And until he's caught,
he's also the reason

01:38.966 --> 01:40.268
you have to shut down.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.935
Oh, I'll be doing no such thing.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.739
I don't think you understand.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.909
He has an obsession with you,
a fantasy of revenge.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.780
Well, Karen,
I also have a fantasy.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.982
Of living a life without fear.

01:55.015 --> 01:58.952
I will not allow him
to take away my power again.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.655
Camp Redwood will open
as scheduled.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.991
-No one is safe.
-Then call the police.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.026
Not that I'll be needing
anything from them.

02:08.028 --> 02:11.832
You know, Karen, God helps those

02:11.865 --> 02:13.767
who help themselves.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.203
I've survived him before,

02:15.236 --> 02:17.271
and if he is stupid enough
to show up,

02:17.305 --> 02:20.574
then I can promise you,
Mr. Jingles will not survive me.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.881
(engine starts)

02:41.329 --> 02:42.830

02:55.843 --> 02:57.278

03:06.954 --> 03:08.222

03:08.256 --> 03:10.258
(engine stops)

03:14.895 --> 03:16.797
(car door closes)

03:19.900 --> 03:21.535
I think it's a flat.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.203
Can you fix it?

03:25.273 --> 03:27.275
(keys jingling)

04:00.641 --> 04:02.810
That looks nasty.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.946
I guess it's my lucky day.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.082
What are the odds
of me meeting you out here?

04:09.116 --> 04:11.084
Pretty good...

04:11.118 --> 04:13.253
since you followed me here.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.956
Benjamin.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.991
(screaming)

04:23.764 --> 04:24.932

-(screams)

04:28.101 --> 04:29.337
(panting)

04:31.372 --> 04:33.374
You were right.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.946
(grunts)

04:45.686 --> 04:48.288
I am a monster.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.192
SHERIFF:
Right now we have
no motive or suspects.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.762
We're urging the public
to be vigilant.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.363
REPORTER:
Is there any connection
to the attacks

06:36.396 --> 06:38.265
and murders that are happening
down in L.A.?

06:38.298 --> 06:40.901
They're calling the killer
the Night Stalker.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.603
I have no comment on that.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.472
ANCHOR:
All that and more
tonight at 11:00.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.373
God, did you guys see that?

06:46.406 --> 06:49.910

Oh, I love this one.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.712
TREVOR:
Oh, this is the-the...

06:51.745 --> 06:52.913
-"Where's the beef?"
-"Where's the beef?"

06:52.946 --> 06:54.314
-(all laugh)
-BROOKE: No, there was a murder

06:54.347 --> 06:56.917
at the gas station.
The one we stopped at.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.119
They're saying it could be
the same guy who attacked me.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.821
Oh, my God.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.090
He's coming after me.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.393
And this is a different killer
from the killer on the phone?

07:06.426 --> 07:09.396
-The one with the keys?
-(all laugh)

07:09.429 --> 07:10.931
I'm not making this up.

-Ms. Booth,
I think we're in danger.
-Yes.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.971
We are in danger.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.607
From sin.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.841
XAVIER:
Brooke's just jumpy

07:20.874 --> 07:22.009
'cause she got a prank call.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.443
It freaked her out.

07:23.477 --> 07:27.180
Well, the locals think I'm crazy
for reopening this camp

07:27.214 --> 07:29.617
to create a sanctuary
of fresh air and exercise

07:29.650 --> 07:31.652
to purify the soul.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.086
But I refuse to let

07:33.120 --> 07:36.156
fear dictate my life.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.659
We've got a big day tomorrow.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.495
Lights out
in exactly 20 minutes.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.296
The boys will leave

07:43.330 --> 07:46.967
-and remove themselves
from temptation.
-(Ray sighs)

07:47.000 --> 07:48.536
Let's go, boys.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.270
Go.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.005
Okay.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.507
Hop to it. Let's go.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.210
You gonna make us pray
the boners away?

07:57.244 --> 07:58.946
(laughs)

07:58.979 --> 08:02.482
A clean body is a clean mind.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.452
How many times do I have
to go over the rules?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.887
Boys shower at night.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.355
No exceptions.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.290
Now go wash the filth off

08:10.323 --> 08:12.225
so you can wake up pure
and refreshed

08:12.259 --> 08:13.761

08:17.097 --> 08:18.966
MONTANA:
Bye.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.001

Bitch.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.907
She has got to get laid.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.042
Otherwise it's gonna be
a long summer. (chuckles)

08:33.881 --> 08:35.082
(door closes)

08:45.693 --> 08:49.496
Look, some dickhead
broke into your apartment

08:49.529 --> 08:51.064
and attacked you.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.900
That's got to be super scary.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.268
I mean, a stranger
once grabbed my boob

08:55.302 --> 08:57.905
outside a Sam Goody,
so I get it.

08:57.938 --> 09:01.008
But not everyone's
out to get you.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.342

09:02.375 --> 09:05.012
I can't be making this all up.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.614
Trauma's a bitch.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.883
When I was six,
my mom sent me away to fat camp.

09:09.917 --> 09:13.420
I was a bit chubs
but super cute.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.056
I'd never been away
from home before.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.291
I was so scared.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.293
Every night,
I'd huddle underneath my covers,

09:20.327 --> 09:21.929
praying for the sun to come up.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.931
Every sound was the bogeyman.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.867
Every shadow was a monster
trying to eat me.

09:26.900 --> 09:31.038
But sometimes a shadow
is just a shadow.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.742
-So the camp helped you
face your demons?
-(scoffs)

09:34.775 --> 09:37.244
Fuck, no. All they taught me
was to nom and vom.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.647
But the point is,

09:39.680 --> 09:42.783
if you imagine the worst,
that's all you see.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.385
You don't have to imagine
the worst

09:45.418 --> 09:47.287
when it's already happened.

I just wanted everything

Dearly beloved,

10:16.850 --> 10:19.086
we are gathered here
on this day to join this man...

10:19.119 --> 10:21.154
I thought he was nervous
or something.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.423
...and this woman
in holy matrimony.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.193
He could be jealous sometimes.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.928
I thought it was romantic.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.963
I thought it meant he loved me.

Joseph Cavanaugh,

10:32.132 --> 10:35.068
do you take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

10:40.207 --> 10:42.710
Don't be afraid.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.177
Okay? You want this.

10:44.211 --> 10:47.447

10:53.420 --> 10:55.388
I went over to your place.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.124
I wanted to tell you
that I couldn't wait

10:57.157 --> 10:58.959
to spend the rest of my life
with you.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.329
Then I saw him.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.965
I saw you, Sam,

11:04.998 --> 11:07.134
go inside.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.904
I waited.
You didn't leave until morning.

Hey, I just-I just crashed
on the couch. That's it.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.043
Nothing happened.
I swear.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.511
You know how scared I get
being alone at night,

11:18.545 --> 11:20.513
and I didn't want to see you
the night before the wedding.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.816

Your mind, your pussy--
he thought it was all his.

And the idea that you wanted to
get your rocks off without him,

12:35.522 --> 12:38.291
that you didn't need him,
drove him freakin' insane.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.499

cheated on Joey.

Smell. Definitely.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.864
-Steal my girl.
-CHET: Oh, my God.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.433
What the hell?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.570
Where are the towels
and little soaps?

13:57.604 --> 14:00.540
You know this isn't a spa,
right?

14:02.075 --> 14:04.677
I'm gonna go get my beach towel.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.213
Save me some hot water.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.714
Yes, ma'am.
(chuckles)

14:07.747 --> 14:09.182
Beach towel?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.170
(crickets chirping)

14:30.203 --> 14:31.972
(leaves crunching)

14:32.605 --> 14:34.541
(laughing)

15:00.934 --> 15:03.036
What the hell, Blake?

15:03.070 --> 15:06.806
That name is reserved
for business associates

15:06.839 --> 15:08.408
and acquaintances.

15:09.442 --> 15:13.146
My boys never call me that.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.016
Fine.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.453
What the hell, Daddy?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.889
(exhales)

15:22.922 --> 15:25.892
You know, it's illegal to
threaten someone over the phone.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.962
Not to mention stalking them.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.899
You always underestimate
yourself, X.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.335
That is your problem.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.005
But you are a goddamn Rembrandt.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.441
Do you think that
I would give up a Rembrandt?

15:42.976 --> 15:44.344
Look,

15:44.377 --> 15:45.912
I'm grateful for all
that you've done for me...

15:45.945 --> 15:49.449
I found you in MacArthur Park,

15:49.482 --> 15:50.984
a needle in your arm,

15:51.018 --> 15:52.986
your blue jeans damp
from your own piss.

15:53.020 --> 15:56.156
I cleaned you up,
inside and out.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.992
Little piece of advice,
by the way:

15:59.026 --> 16:01.094
if you're trying to run away,

16:01.128 --> 16:03.630
don't leave a forwarding address
for your paychecks

16:03.663 --> 16:05.298
at the aerobics studio.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.668
(chuckles): You are as dumb
as you are pretty.

16:08.701 --> 16:13.173
And you are very, very pretty.

16:13.206 --> 16:16.209
You promised me
I only had to do one.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.247
I'm not gay.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.116
Gay for pay, baby.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.852
I'm working so hard
to be a real actor.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.288
You think Michael J. Fox
ever did gay porn?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.023
-Tom Selleck?
-Why are you betting

16:30.057 --> 16:32.825
a one-in-a-million chance
on mainstream success

16:32.859 --> 16:36.429
when I am here
offering you stardom?

16:37.697 --> 16:38.898
Fuck this.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.900
I'm not doing it.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.208
-(grunts)
-(groans, hisses)

16:48.241 --> 16:49.976
You're gonna do what Daddy says.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.713
Or I'm gonna send copies
of that tape to all your friends

16:53.746 --> 16:56.183
and your bosses
at that dance studio.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.717
I might hunt down
that drunk mother of yours,

16:57.750 --> 16:59.486
send a copy to her.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.988
And what if I could get you
someone better to replace me?

17:02.021 --> 17:02.989
Hmm?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.724
(scoffs)

17:04.757 --> 17:06.593
The next John Holmes.

17:06.626 --> 17:07.594
Even bigger.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.895
Huh.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.097

17:10.130 --> 17:11.831

Takes more than it gives.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.688
Cost me that Jane Fonda video.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.924
Most girls can't handle it.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.726

17:39.759 --> 17:42.395

Don't call them corpses, man.
They're human beings.

Satan would show me the path.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.074

19:37.344 --> 19:39.011

You are an observant young man.

Not really.

I dropped out in ninth grade.

And I mean
I killed him dead, no question.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.962
I see.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.230
Was that the first time
you've killed someone?

26:38.264 --> 26:40.566
No.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.436
But it's the first time
I had to do it twice.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.105
I killed him.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.940
And then he was alive again.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.777
-How?
-Well, Jesus, of course.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.013
The point of religion, of God,

26:54.046 --> 26:55.948
is to be there

26:55.982 --> 26:59.085
when there's no other way
to explain something.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.620
And this...

27:01.654 --> 27:04.023
this man in the photo
has been dead

27:04.056 --> 27:06.292
for 14 years.

27:06.325 --> 27:09.762
I saw his lifeless body myself
all those years ago.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.164
That makes no sense.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.868
Let me help you understand.

27:15.902 --> 27:19.638
What's the worst thing
that ever happened to you?

27:19.672 --> 27:23.676
I don't like talking
about myself like that.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.212
Oh, I don't think that's true.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.681
I think...
you just haven't found

27:28.715 --> 27:30.850
the right person to listen

27:30.883 --> 27:33.319
the way that you need.

27:35.888 --> 27:39.525
The worst thing
that ever happened to me...

27:39.558 --> 27:42.528
Everything.

27:42.561 --> 27:44.663
Pain's all I've ever known.

27:44.697 --> 27:47.867
Pain's how the world's
always talked to me.

27:47.900 --> 27:51.570
Why shouldn't pain
be how I talk back?

27:53.105 --> 27:55.307
My mother worked
in a boot factory.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.143
She breathed in all
of those chemicals

27:57.176 --> 27:58.911
when she was pregnant with me.

27:58.945 --> 28:02.749
I was poisoned before
I even took my first breath.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.933
After the swing hit me,
I started having seizures.

28:20.967 --> 28:23.269
(indistinct shouting)

28:23.302 --> 28:25.071
My cousin Mike lived with us.

28:29.776 --> 28:32.411
He was a Green Beret
just back from Vietnam,

28:32.444 --> 28:34.113
and he showed me pictures
of all the girls

28:34.146 --> 28:35.714
he'd killed over there
in the jungle.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.750
You could do anything there,
he told me.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.886
You were free.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.587
His wife didn't like him
showing me.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.356
She didn't want me to be free.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.759
-(gunshot)
-MARGARET: Did you ever wonder

28:46.793 --> 28:50.462
why any of that awful stuff
happened to you?

28:50.496 --> 28:52.832
It happened to you...

28:54.566 --> 28:57.904
...because all of that
had to happen to you

28:57.937 --> 29:01.808
to make you the man
you are today.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.510
The one who was brought here
to me.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.818
A girl brought me here.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.188
But I think I like you better.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.826
I know I do.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.995
You listen to me.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.964
Can I see your feet?

29:29.268 --> 29:32.071
I understand you, Richard.

29:32.104 --> 29:36.475
Do you want to know
the other great thing about God?

29:36.508 --> 29:38.811
You can use him to explain
why something happened,

29:38.845 --> 29:40.813
but you can also use him

29:40.847 --> 29:42.915
to explain why
you did something.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.451
Even something horrible.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.519
Isn't that great?

29:48.988 --> 29:51.924
So I don't have to feel bad
for anything I do?

29:51.958 --> 29:55.094
-Not if you're doing God's work.
-Or Satan's.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.097
And you say
you didn't do well in school.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.367
Your cousin talked to you
about being free.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.435
All you need to have the freedom

30:03.469 --> 30:06.638
to do whatever you want
is two things--

30:06.672 --> 30:09.876
God and trauma.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.980
Freedom.

30:17.183 --> 30:20.019
You're the first person
who really sees me.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.622
I need you, Richard.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.692
This man, or whatever he is,

30:26.725 --> 30:29.628
cannot be terrorizing
the children.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.398
This must be a haven for them.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.868
You need to find him
and make him leave.

30:35.902 --> 30:37.469
How?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.638
I believe in Baby Jesus,
Richard,

30:39.671 --> 30:41.640
and I believe in you.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.210
I'll look
for this mysterious counselor.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.245
But I must insist

30:46.278 --> 30:48.814
that you do not murder anyone
along the way.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.950
There's been enough killing
at this camp.

30:52.919 --> 30:56.355
-(screams)
-(nervous chatter)

30:56.388 --> 30:58.024
-Oh.
-Ah.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.358
-Come on, let's go.
-(engine not turning over)

30:59.391 --> 31:01.093
I can't unsee that shit!

31:01.127 --> 31:03.930
It was gray matter
coming out of his head, man!

31:03.963 --> 31:05.864
Who gives a shit?!
Xavier, just drive!

31:05.898 --> 31:07.499
-TREVOR: Go!
-(engine not turning over)

31:07.533 --> 31:10.102
It's not gonna start.
We're stuck here!

31:10.136 --> 31:11.770
(Montana gasps)

31:11.803 --> 31:13.439
I can't die
with a guilty conscience.

31:13.472 --> 31:14.907
I totally did those steroids.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.442
Yeah, we all fucking know!

31:16.475 --> 31:19.045
-Come on, baby.
-(engine not turning over)

31:19.078 --> 31:21.180
(engine starts)

31:21.213 --> 31:22.781
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh, oh.

31:22.814 --> 31:23.950
-Yeah!
-(all cheering)

31:23.983 --> 31:25.918
(whooping)

31:27.386 --> 31:29.088
-(engine revving)
-Yeah!

31:29.121 --> 31:31.057
(shrieking)

31:31.090 --> 31:32.724
(whooping)

31:32.758 --> 31:34.893
-Yeah! Whoo!
-Fuck you, Camp Redwood!

31:34.927 --> 31:36.462
(laughing)

31:36.495 --> 31:38.897
(yelling)

31:42.334 --> 31:44.903
-(shouts)
-(screaming)

31:52.744 --> 31:55.481
Rita? Are you okay?

31:55.514 --> 31:57.083
Can you sit up?

31:57.116 --> 31:58.951
(Rita groans)

31:58.985 --> 32:00.953
Shit. That's Margaret's car.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.288
That ain't buffing out.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.658
-He's in the infirmary.
-What?

32:06.692 --> 32:09.928
I thought I locked the door, but
then I heard it-- the jingling.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.932
-He's back.
-Oh, fuck.

32:13.966 --> 32:16.102
-(Rita whimpers)
-(groans)

32:16.135 --> 32:17.970
Oh, God.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.341
-Man.
-(engine not turning over)

32:22.374 --> 32:24.010
-(Rita groans)
-CHET: Dude!

32:24.043 --> 32:26.979
Dude! It's dead.

32:27.013 --> 32:28.914
We're all gonna be dead
if we don't get out of here.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.017
I got a car.
It's a Rabbit, though.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.918
-We won't all fit.
-TREVOR: I got my Ninja,

32:32.951 --> 32:35.421
but, uh, I-I mean,
I can fit someone on the back.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.157
-What's a Ninja?
-A badass motorcycle.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.992
One problem--
my keys are in the cabin.

32:40.026 --> 32:42.094
RITA:
I got to get my keys, too.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.430
-Somebody come with me.
-RAY: There are two

32:44.463 --> 32:45.664
crazed killers
roaming around that camp.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.333
And you want us to go back?

32:47.366 --> 32:50.336
-I'm not going alone.
-You bunch of pussies. I'll go.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.338
We should all go. Two groups.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.506
-I mean, we're no safer
out here in the open.
-He's right.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.708
Montana, Xavier with me.
The rest of you with Rita.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.310
Get the keys,
get your asses back here.

32:58.344 --> 33:00.346
-Got it? Let's go.
-Yeah.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.152
(hiker panting)

33:09.488 --> 33:11.457
You're not supposed to be here.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.659
It is you.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.494
You need to leave.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.096
It's not safe.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.568
You're really here, Jonas.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.938
How is this possible?

33:29.175 --> 33:30.776
I know you.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.047
Margaret?

33:36.848 --> 33:38.184
But you look so different.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.419
You look exactly the same.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.854
But I thought you were dead.

33:42.888 --> 33:46.758
I'm not,
but I think you might be.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.262
What? No.

33:50.296 --> 33:53.099
I-I... I don't understand.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.500
Jonas, what year is it?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.668
It's 1970.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.004
What's the last thing
you remember?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.572
Well, I don't know.

34:00.606 --> 34:01.873
I-I... I was running.

34:01.907 --> 34:03.909
-Running from what?
-(crying)

34:03.942 --> 34:06.578
It was horrible.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.880
So much blood.

34:08.914 --> 34:10.782
(screaming)

34:10.816 --> 34:13.152
Whose blood?
What did you see?

34:14.220 --> 34:16.122
Oh, God.

34:17.089 --> 34:20.025
This is all my fault.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.927
I saw you.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.564
(gasps)

34:27.566 --> 34:29.835
-(woman screaming)
-(Jonas whimpers softly)

34:33.305 --> 34:34.540
JONAS:
I should have helped you.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.108
I left you to die.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.779
-(tires screech)
-(grunts)

34:40.812 --> 34:42.581
(Jonas groaning)

34:49.121 --> 34:51.290
(keys jingling)

34:51.323 --> 34:54.593
(crying)

34:54.626 --> 34:56.995
No. Please, please.

34:57.028 --> 34:58.397
No!

34:58.430 --> 35:02.301
MARGARET:
So Jingles was in the truck.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.837
-You saw him?
-I heard him.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.106
The keys.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.010
I-I'm dead.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.247
Am I a ghost?

35:15.281 --> 35:17.483
Oh, who am I, Dan Aykroyd?
I guess.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.084
Ghosts aren't real.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.986
There are ghosts in the Bible,

35:21.019 --> 35:24.122
and you're here,
so they must be real.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.026
Probably would have stayed out
on that road

35:28.059 --> 35:29.961
where you died if those moron
counselors hadn't picked you up

35:29.995 --> 35:31.397
and brought you to camp.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.702
So many people died,

35:36.735 --> 35:39.638
and I just... ran.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.874
I'm a coward.

35:44.009 --> 35:47.012
(crying):
What am I supposed to do now?

36:01.593 --> 36:03.595
(floorboards creaking)

36:10.936 --> 36:12.904
I'm not going inside.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.906
He could still be in there. No.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.743
I don't hear anything.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.147
You know where the keys are.
Let's just get them and get out.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.916
-No, I can't.
-Dude, go first.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.419
-Fuck you. Why me?
-You're a world-class athlete.

36:27.453 --> 36:30.689
-You're faster than all of us.
-I do the fucking pommel horse.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.858
Shh!

36:32.891 --> 36:35.060
I'll go.

36:35.093 --> 36:37.095
(sighs)

36:45.103 --> 36:47.105
Keys are in my desk.

36:57.115 --> 36:59.385
They're not here.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.956
(keys jingling)

37:06.592 --> 37:09.295
-I shouldn't have come here.
-MONTANA: Yeah.

37:09.328 --> 37:11.297
Okay. Bad idea overall.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.531
Trevor, how's it coming?

37:12.564 --> 37:14.300
-Got 'em.
-Let's go.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.102
TREVOR:
Dude, we got to go.

37:17.135 --> 37:20.038
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.973
I just wanted to get away,

37:22.007 --> 37:23.775
have a fun summer--

37:23.809 --> 37:25.777
a-a little fresh air,

37:25.811 --> 37:28.380
some canoeing, archery.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.549
Why are you wigging out?
Now is not the time.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.651
'Cause all this is my fault.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.953
That guy in the showers.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.556
I knew him.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.157
His name was Blake.

37:39.190 --> 37:42.394
He came here because of me,
and now...

37:42.428 --> 37:43.929
Now he's dead.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.097
They got to be in here.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.936
-No.
-(clattering)

37:51.970 --> 37:54.806
Hey.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.808
It's gonna be all right.

37:56.842 --> 37:59.244
We'll walk out of here
if we have to.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.447
Just stay away from me.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.516
Everyone I get close to
ends up getting hurt.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.553
(keys jingling)

38:18.029 --> 38:20.031
(pounding on door)

38:24.970 --> 38:27.038
-(pounding continues)
-XAVIER: He saved me.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.107
And I screwed him over.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.378
And all of this-- my punishment.

38:32.411 --> 38:35.246
-Okay.
-(pounding on door)

38:37.248 --> 38:40.051
Xavier, let's get out of here.
Let's go. He's out there.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.091
-We're all gonna die.
-(pounding continues)
