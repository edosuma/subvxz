01:39.600 --> 01:41.059
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:41.059 --> 01:42.978
I have always

I am so excited to be here!

01:45.731 --> 01:48.066
I promise you guys

Wait, wait, wait.
What's going on here?

02:02.122 --> 02:06.001
Yeah. And aren't you a
little too three dimensional

02:06.001 --> 02:08.169

show, young lady?

02:08.169 --> 02:10.297
Yes, yes, I am.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.924
But I'm doing it anyway
so just deal with it.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.302
But we have hosting
contracts and everything.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.928
Did you read
your contracts?

02:16.928 --> 02:19.056
Nobody reads 'em, they're
like a hundred pages long.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.183
And pages two
through 99 are useless.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.685
Like parsley on a dinner plate.
Nobody eats it.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.687
You know, if they're gonna
put stuff on your plate

02:25.687 --> 02:27.939
that you're not gonna eat, why
not make it something useful,

02:28.023 --> 02:30.942
like a key chain,
or gold doubloons.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.945
Dude, why are you
rambling on about parsley?

02:34.029 --> 02:37.324
You're bringing the entire
energy of the show down!

02:37.824 --> 02:39.951
Maybe you guys
can be my co-hosts!

02:39.951 --> 02:42.204
Co-hosts! I don't like
the sound of that.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.705
Sounds like a demotion.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.207
Enough of you two.

02:45.957 --> 02:49.044
You guys ready?
Let's get this party started!

02:50.796 --> 02:53.298
There were so many
songs to pick from.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.300
I mean, just take
a look at all of them.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.095
Wow, that is

10:18.910 --> 10:20.870
Look, look, look... I'm vogueing...
Vogueing?

10:20.870 --> 10:24.874
I love vogueing.
It's so '90s.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.794
I was a bit of
a secret voguer myself.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.254
Really?
It wasn't a secret.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.256
You know what
we should do then?

10:31.256 --> 10:32.382
Strike a pose.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.676
(CROWD WHISTLING)

10:42.308 --> 10:44.561
Vogue. Vogueing?
That's it.

10:44.561 --> 10:47.313
Look it up, kids. That's
what the Internet is for.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.442
That was fun. Great idea, Kelly.
Thank you.

10:51.526 --> 10:52.819
But, but...
Vogueing was my idea.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.821
I started to say vogueing
and you just cut me off

10:54.821 --> 10:57.824
right before when I just
got "v0" out, you know.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.659
What did you think
I was going to say?

10:59.701 --> 11:01.911
Vociferous? What other
words start with "vo"?

11:01.911 --> 11:03.955
Give it a rest, Heinz.
He's always like this.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.207
That's it.
That is it!

11:06.207 --> 11:11.171
You will rue the day that you demoted
Heinz Doofenshmirtz to co-host!

11:11.588 --> 11:12.672
Hmm.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.550
You know what that means?
I think I do.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.219
More hosting for us!

11:18.219 --> 11:20.221
All right!
Here's a little ditty

11:20.221 --> 11:22.974

(CROWD CHEERING)

13:03.950 --> 13:08.037
Yes! Now that I'm back in my old clothes...

13:08.037 --> 13:11.082

will make a comeback.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.591
So, Phineas, what do you
think of the City of Love?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.802
I wish it was the
city of airplane parts.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.806
You should take a moment
to relax and enjoy it.

<i>L? We could shore o crepe

13:32.603 --> 13:34.689

<i>P Toke o break and smell these

13:43.990 --> 13:46.117

pieces of that hanging around.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.994
The rivets would come in handy.
Oh, Phineas.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.854
who is not your co-host!

15:42.859 --> 15:44.944
Wow. That was close!

15:45.820 --> 15:47.864
Wait. Was that
Perry the Platypus?

15:47.864 --> 15:50.116
Great. They're probably
letting him host the show.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.117

you'd stop by.

to introduce the next song?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.255
Let me translate
for you guys.

16:04.255 --> 16:07.258

he just said was,

16:07.258 --> 16:09.135
"Swinging in at
song number five is..."

16:10.636 --> 16:15.141
Summer. It sounds dangerous yet
oddly compelling. What is it?

16:15.141 --> 16:17.768
What is summer?
Man, where do I begin?

16:19.145 --> 16:22.273

16:43.669 --> 16:48.132
<i>P It's summer!
Mon, where do we begin</i>

16:50.051 --> 16:55.890
<i>P It's ponds and pools and garden

17:02.313 --> 17:05.733
<i>P It's also surfing tidal

18:11.966 --> 18:16.095
That last song just makes me
we want to move and groove,

18:16.095 --> 18:17.930
but enough about me!

18:17.930 --> 18:20.224
Because I have
a surprise for everyone.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.603
A friend of mine wanted
to stop by and say "Hi."

18:23.603 --> 18:24.979
So please put
your hands together

18:24.979 --> 18:28.733
and give a warm welcome
to Maia Mitchell!

18:29.358 --> 18:30.943
Hi.
Hello.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.820
I was uh... I was
watching from backstage

18:32.820 --> 18:34.947
and could not wait
to get out here.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.741
I love all the songs so far.

18:36.741 --> 18:37.867
I know, right?
Aren't they fun?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.118
Yeah! They're amazing.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.330
And Kelly, you're doing
an awesome job of hosting!

18:42.705 --> 18:44.123
Isn't she? I was a
little bit nervous.

18:44.749 --> 18:45.875
MAIA: No. no, you're great.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.127
And Major Monogram.
I'm Maia.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.879
Pleasure to meet you,
young lady.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.132
And Perry!
I love you.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.383
You're my favorite,
actually.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.385
Because we have
something in common.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.137
What's that?
We're both from Australia.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.889
(GASPS) Didn't even
think of that.

18:59.889 --> 19:00.973
That's so cool!

19:00.973 --> 19:03.100
That is so cool.
(CHUCKLES)

19:03.768 --> 19:05.394
Maia, why don't you
introduce the next song?

19:05.394 --> 19:07.647
I was actually waiting
for you to ask me to do that.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.982
Check it out.
It's number four!

19:11.859 --> 19:15.154
Yeah! I'm you from
another dimension!

19:15.154 --> 19:17.907
Well, that would explain
the handsomeness.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.867
Right back at you,
big guy.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.995
Does that mean you and
I are exactly alike?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.789
I suppose so.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.310
<i>P With my irrational fears</i>

19:46.310 --> 19:48.688
But not the vending machine thing.
That's gonna happen.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.190
<i>P But now before me, I see</i>

20:19.343 --> 20:22.096
that your scar goes
over your eye patch.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.347
Yeah?

20:24.098 --> 20:25.474
Nothing.

What's that? I mean, are we
doing a TV show together?

21:14.023 --> 21:15.983
No. It just sort of
sounded like...

21:15.983 --> 21:17.902
I mean, we could.
We should!

21:17.902 --> 21:20.529
Hmm. Maybe we're
not so much alike.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.156
That can be
our catch phrase.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.116
You're the grumpy one.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.412
Wow, there are
so many great songs!

21:28.788 --> 21:30.873
I know! What did you think
about that last song, Perry?

21:30.873 --> 21:31.916
(CHATTERING)

21:32.792 --> 21:35.377
I have a confession.
What's that?

21:35.377 --> 21:38.923
I might uh, make Perry noises
when no one's looking.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.549
(GASPS)
You're kidding, me too!

21:40.549 --> 21:42.051
You do?

you're not supposed
to think my dad is cool.

that I think he's cool.

be really cool?

24:16.163 --> 24:18.040
To write a song.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.042
So next year the song can
be on the countdown!

24:20.042 --> 24:23.462
Well, as a fellow musician,
I heartily agree.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.964
Oh, you're a musician?

24:24.964 --> 24:26.715
Well, yes,

Maia Mitchell?

24:34.556 --> 24:36.308
I'm afraid so.
Ah, bummer.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.727
Anyway, as a musician,
not as a co-host, mind you

24:38.727 --> 24:42.314
I'd like to get in on this little
song-writing thing you're about to do.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.567
Oh, several things, but
my instrument of choice

24:45.567 --> 24:46.986
is the kazoo.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.445
You rock the kaz?
I do.

24:48.445 --> 24:51.240
Fine! Let's start
with the lyrics then.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.201
Maybe we can do some sort of
a round robin kinda thing

24:54.201 --> 24:57.121
and write a line, and the
next person can rhyme it.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.998
Oh, good idea. (CLEARS
THROAT) Me first, me first.

24:58.998 --> 25:03.502
Uh, let's see. "When I wake
up in the morning sun."

"I realize
you're the only one."

Dude, really?

25:12.761 --> 25:14.013
What? What?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.724
There's no rhyme
for the word silver.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.517
She's <i>right.
No. No, look...</i>

What is a bilver?

25:23.647 --> 25:26.275
It's a...
Water moving thingy.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.652
Ibefieve what you're
thinking of is a bilge pump.

25:28.652 --> 25:31.030
Oh, I've always
called it a bilver.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.281
Okay. How about this?

25:32.281 --> 25:35.492
"And by the moon
that's oh so orange."

25:35.492 --> 25:36.744

Thank you so much everybody,
that was so much fun!

32:18.687 --> 32:20.814
