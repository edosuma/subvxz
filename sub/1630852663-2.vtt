WEBVTT

01:52.166 --> 01:53.666
- Did you think
we'd forget about you?

01:53.750 --> 01:55.791
- I can't give you
what I haven't got.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.291
- Find it!

01:57.375 --> 01:58.500
But I can't.

01:58.583 --> 01:59.666
Get the money.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.833
I'll be back to collect it
tomorrow.

02:14.666 --> 02:15.833
- At this rate,
I shall have more clothes

02:15.916 --> 02:17.375
than the Princess of Wales.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.208
- But if Mrs. Van Rhijn
insists...

02:19.291 --> 02:21.708
- Who am I to object?

02:21.791 --> 02:23.500
- It's good of you
to keep me company.

02:23.583 --> 02:24.666
I don't mind.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.041
At least,
I think it's ridiculous

02:26.125 --> 02:28.041
that you're not allowed
to walk out on your own.

02:28.125 --> 02:30.208
But it gives me a chance
to get some air.

02:30.291 --> 02:32.208
Now for the sleeves.

02:32.291 --> 02:35.208
- By the way, someone from home
is coming to the city.

02:35.291 --> 02:36.875
- Oh?
- I got a letter this morning.

02:36.958 --> 02:39.000
- A friend from Pennsylvania?

02:39.083 --> 02:39.958
Not exactly.

02:40.041 --> 02:41.708
The lawyer who managed
my father's affairs

02:41.791 --> 02:42.750
when he died.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.625
Is it about business?

02:44.708 --> 02:47.541
- It may be.
He doesn't really say.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.916
- Will you let him visit
61st Street?

02:50.000 --> 02:50.916
Why?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.083
Would that be very shocking?

02:52.166 --> 02:53.083
It's not that,

02:53.166 --> 02:55.083
although Mrs. Van Rhijn
may think so.

02:55.166 --> 02:58.083
But, uh, I might want
to ask his advice.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.333
Really?

02:59.416 --> 03:02.166
- Any colored lawyer would find
his way back to my father,

03:02.250 --> 03:03.375
and he can't know about it.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.750
- I'm not sure
Mr. Raikes would do it.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.250
- But I can always ask.
- Excuse me--

03:07.333 --> 03:09.375
- And he studied law
in Pennsylvania?

03:09.458 --> 03:10.958
I presume so.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.458
Is this for your writing?

03:13.541 --> 03:15.208
No, it's a personal matter.

03:15.291 --> 03:17.750
- Raise your arms, please.
- How is the writing going?

03:17.833 --> 03:19.041
Are you getting much done?

03:19.125 --> 03:20.541
I think so.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.000
I sent out query letters.

03:22.083 --> 03:23.875
To which publications?

03:23.958 --> 03:26.208
- No, I'll tell you
once I hear back from them.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.041
I don't want to risk bad luck.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.000
- Well, I hope Mr. Raikes
can be of help.

03:31.083 --> 03:35.250
I also hope he hasn't turned up
a pile of Daddy's debts.

03:35.333 --> 03:36.291
<i>What can you mean?</i>

03:36.375 --> 03:38.458
Of course I haven't called
on Mrs. Russell.

03:38.541 --> 03:41.291
- Marian, I hope you don't
encourage her in this.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.625
I don't.

03:42.708 --> 03:44.791
- What do you know about
the Russells' daughter, Glenys?

03:44.875 --> 03:45.958
Is she out?

03:46.041 --> 03:47.625
- Do people like that
bring their daughters out?

03:47.708 --> 03:50.083
I thought they just sold them
to the highest bidder.

03:50.166 --> 03:51.625
- She's called Gladys,
not Glenys.

03:51.708 --> 03:52.916
And I don't think
she is out yet.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.708
- But she's very nice.
- How do you know?

03:54.791 --> 03:56.916
I met her with Aurora Fane.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.166
- Aurora skates so close
to the edge.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.583
- Do you know this Gladys well
enough to ask her to luncheon?

04:01.666 --> 04:04.125
- Not really.
- I should think not.

04:04.208 --> 04:05.916
- Agnes,
you can't have anything

04:06.000 --> 04:07.666
against an innocent
young girl.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.291
I am opposed to her tribe.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.333
- Is this for sending up?
- Right there.

04:19.958 --> 04:21.625
- Are you quite well,
Mrs. Bauer?

04:21.708 --> 04:22.958
Why wouldn't I be?

04:23.041 --> 04:23.958
You seem upset.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.875
- Oh,
I've been chopping onions.

04:28.583 --> 04:31.666
- Miss Scott, have you been
working with Mrs. Van Rhijn?

04:31.750 --> 04:32.833
Yes.

04:32.916 --> 04:34.958
- Suppose you think that
makes you a sort of secretary.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.625
- She is a secretary
and not a "sort of" anything,

04:37.708 --> 04:40.708
which puts her above you in the
pecking order, Miss Armstrong.

04:40.791 --> 04:42.625
- Mr. Oscar's good-looking,
isn't he?

04:42.708 --> 04:43.875
I saw him when he left.

04:43.958 --> 04:45.625
- Mr. Oscar's interested
in one thing only,

04:45.708 --> 04:47.291
- and you haven't got it.
- What's that?

04:47.375 --> 04:49.333
- Money.
- Don't bash her down.

04:49.416 --> 04:52.083
She only said he was
good-looking, and so he is.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.458
- I wonder if they'll try
to set him up with Miss Marian.

04:54.541 --> 04:56.416
- He wants an heiress,
the richest he can find.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.541
And Miss Marian hasn't
a penny to her name.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.583
- If you've finished
demolishing the characters

05:00.666 --> 05:03.166
of every member of this family,
John and I will serve luncheon.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.208
- Are you ready, Mrs. Bauer?
- I am.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.291
Who is this Mr. Raikes?

05:13.375 --> 05:15.833
- The lawyer who settled
Henry's estate.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.833
- Do we have to receive him?
- He waived his fee.

05:18.916 --> 05:20.000
Oh, I see.

05:20.083 --> 05:23.166
Well, let's make it tea
and be quick about it.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.625
Good. Now we can get started.

05:25.708 --> 05:27.416
Has Mr. Raikes arrived
in the city?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.333
He should be here by now.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.166
- Then ask him
for tea tomorrow.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.833
- You don't have to.
- Ada says he waived his fee.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.125
- He did.
- Then you will give him tea.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.333
You cannot be indebted
to these people.

05:38.416 --> 05:41.250
- Very well, I'll ask him
for half past 4:00.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.250
Anne Morris wants me
to call on her at 3:00.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.791
She'd like me to take a stall
in her bazaar.

05:45.875 --> 05:48.083
- What do you mean,
take a stall?

05:48.166 --> 05:50.250
- Run a stall and gather
the things we'll sell.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.416
It's for charity.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.250
- Well, I didn't think
it was for profit.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.583
- They're joining
the Dispensary

05:54.666 --> 05:55.750
for Poor Women and Children

05:55.833 --> 05:58.208
with the Infirmary
for Indigent Women and Children

05:58.291 --> 06:00.166
and they'll move
the whole thing to 7th Street.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.958
- That's sounds sensible,
doesn't it?

06:03.291 --> 06:05.875
- It sounds dull enough
to be respectable, at any rate.

06:12.291 --> 06:13.458
There you are.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.500
Do you still see Mrs. Morris?

06:15.583 --> 06:17.958
- I haven't quarreled with her,
if that's what you mean.

06:18.041 --> 06:19.666
But you don't see her?

06:19.750 --> 06:21.375
- I gave her a check
for her charity,

06:21.458 --> 06:23.166
which, as you
so gallantly pointed out,

06:23.250 --> 06:24.375
was all they wanted from me,

06:24.458 --> 06:25.791
and I haven't heard
from her since.

06:25.875 --> 06:28.375
- You know, she's married
to Alderman Patrick Morris.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.500
- So I believe.
- I'd like to meet him.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.375
- Then invite him
to your office.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.416
I want it to be informal.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.625
- Ask him here for dinner.
- He wouldn't come.

06:36.708 --> 06:37.916
Ask him anyway.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.708
<i>- You're not suggesting</i>
<i>we should go.</i>

06:46.791 --> 06:50.583
- I'm curious as to why
I'm included in her largesse.

06:50.666 --> 06:53.416
I suspect her husband's had
a hand in it.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.583
Does that make a difference?

06:55.666 --> 06:57.583
- George Russell
is a force in this city,

06:57.666 --> 06:59.333
whatever you like to pretend.

06:59.416 --> 07:00.833
But who else would be there?

07:00.916 --> 07:02.458
We could be dining with anyone.

07:02.541 --> 07:04.541
- Won't there just be
the four of us?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.666
- Can't you meet him
at his office?

07:06.750 --> 07:08.666
- It's not what he wants,
is it?

07:08.750 --> 07:10.875
- But how would I explain
to people?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.500
- Why not say you wanted
to invite her

07:13.583 --> 07:14.958
onto the board of your bazaar?

07:15.041 --> 07:15.958
I don't think so.

07:16.041 --> 07:17.833
Aurora Fane's
the chairwoman again,

07:17.916 --> 07:19.208
and they had a falling-out
last time.

07:19.291 --> 07:20.833
You are joint chairwomen.

07:20.916 --> 07:22.666
The choice is yours
as much as hers.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.250
- I'm not sure
its ever successful,

07:25.333 --> 07:27.458
trying to mix different types.

07:27.541 --> 07:29.458
- You won't say as much,
I hope.

07:29.541 --> 07:31.333
Of course not.

07:31.416 --> 07:34.125
And I'll invite her to come
and support us on the day.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.625
She can't be offended at that.

07:35.708 --> 07:37.500
Oh, can't she?

07:40.125 --> 07:42.375
You won't accept

07:42.458 --> 07:45.041
if Mr. Russell makes you
an offer.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.916
I shouldn't think so.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.666
But I'd like to know
what I'm turning down.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.958
- And when Mrs. Astor hears
we've gone to their house,

07:53.041 --> 07:54.041
what then?

07:54.125 --> 07:56.083
- Mrs. Astor knows
how the world works.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.708
Thank you, Bannister.

08:00.791 --> 08:02.791
Please tell Mrs. Bauer
I've asked Mr. Oscar

08:02.875 --> 08:04.333
to join us for tea.

08:04.416 --> 08:06.083
He'll be company
for Miss Marian's friend,

08:06.166 --> 08:08.333
- so we'll be five.
- Very good, ma'am.

08:08.416 --> 08:10.708
- Can Oscar get away?
- He says so.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.666
He's got a luncheon
at the Union

08:12.750 --> 08:15.291
with Ogden Goelet,
and he'll come straight on.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.625
He won't go back to the bank.

08:17.708 --> 08:21.708
- Could he introduce Marian
to some of his friends?

08:21.791 --> 08:24.208
He must know any number
of suitable young men.

08:24.291 --> 08:28.125
- Hmm, well, John Adams wasn't
exactly a roaring success.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.916
But I agree, he must know
other candidates.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.291
- Or perhaps Oscar might
take a shine to her himself.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.875
Take a shine?

08:37.958 --> 08:40.250
- I only meant she's--
- They are first cousins.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.916
And she hasn't a cent.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.625
So I'd be grateful
if you would keep

08:43.708 --> 08:46.041
your servants' hall slang
to yourself.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.625
- Money isn't everything,
Agnes.

08:48.708 --> 08:50.375
Ha, you say that to me

08:50.458 --> 08:52.708
after the sacrifice I made
to save your skin?

08:52.791 --> 08:55.333
- To save both our skins,
Agnes.

09:04.750 --> 09:05.958
- You've heard
we're to entertain

09:06.041 --> 09:08.083
Alderman Morris and his wife?

09:08.166 --> 09:11.500
- And if I know Mrs. Russell,
she'll want quite a show.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.291
- I've made a list
of what I'll need

09:13.375 --> 09:14.458
from the store cupboard

09:14.541 --> 09:16.125
and a few things
that we'll have to order in.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.750
- I'll take care of it,
thank you.

09:17.833 --> 09:18.875
Mm.

09:20.750 --> 09:23.791
Are you starting to feel
at home?

09:23.875 --> 09:25.083
I think so.

09:25.166 --> 09:27.166
But I'm open to advice
if you have any.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.458
- Oh, you look
as if you know the ropes

09:28.541 --> 09:30.291
pretty well, Mrs. Bruce.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.750
Have you always done
this kind of work?

09:32.833 --> 09:34.416
More or less.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.458
My mother answered
an advertisement

09:36.541 --> 09:39.000
for a kitchen maid
when I was 12, and that was it.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.916
- You worked your way
up the ladder.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.750
Were your parents in service?

09:42.833 --> 09:44.083
Oh, no.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.833
My beginnings were very humble.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.166
My father was a farmworker,
and my mother used to pick

09:48.250 --> 09:50.333
- fruit in the fall.
- Pfft.

09:50.416 --> 09:52.416
- I never knew a world
like this existed.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.833
Well, I envy you.

09:54.916 --> 09:56.041
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.833
- If you offered most people
the choice between a top chef

09:58.916 --> 10:01.833
and a spinster housekeeper,
I know which they'd take.

10:01.916 --> 10:03.541
- It doesn't mean
they'd be right.

10:07.166 --> 10:08.666
- So it will be
at the Veterans' Room

10:08.750 --> 10:10.375
at the new
Seventh Regiment Armory.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.000
You're sure they'll agree?

10:12.083 --> 10:14.291
- Mrs. Druett says
they'll be keen to help.

10:14.375 --> 10:15.666
I'll call him there this week.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.125
- And we have enough
stall holders?

10:17.208 --> 10:18.458
- all: Mm-hmm.
- I think so.

10:18.541 --> 10:20.625
We don't want a crush.

10:20.708 --> 10:22.750
- Have you asked Mrs. Russell?
- Hmm?

10:23.833 --> 10:26.000
- We won't go
down that route again.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.000
- Precisely.
- Good.

10:27.083 --> 10:28.583
- I don't see why not.
I like her.

10:28.666 --> 10:30.000
Careful, my dear.

10:30.083 --> 10:32.375
Or I'll report you
to Aunt Agnes.

10:32.458 --> 10:33.708
But why keep her out?

10:33.791 --> 10:34.833
She can give more to the cause

10:34.916 --> 10:36.375
than the rest of us
put together.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.375
- She's welcome to make
a donation.

10:38.458 --> 10:40.041
We're dining with her soon,
and I'll try

10:40.125 --> 10:42.041
to inspire her with our work.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.875
- You're having dinner
with Mrs. Russell?

10:43.958 --> 10:45.375
At her house?

10:45.458 --> 10:47.541
- Her husband has something
he wants to talk about

10:47.625 --> 10:49.166
with Mr. Morris.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.666
- Do I hear my name taken
in vain?

10:50.750 --> 10:53.500
- You're not to disturb
our meeting.

10:53.583 --> 10:56.000
- I wonder, will you include
Mrs. Russell

10:56.083 --> 10:58.625
- among your stall holders?
- Apparently not.

10:58.708 --> 10:59.875
- We still want
her check, though.

10:59.958 --> 11:02.208
We just mean
to insult her first.

11:02.958 --> 11:05.000
- Her husband won't take kindly
to the snub.

11:05.083 --> 11:07.333
- This bazaar
is in aid of children.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.916
We need everything to be
as pure as the driven snow.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.916
- And so you mean to tangle
with the men

11:13.000 --> 11:15.750
who own most of the railroads
in this country?

11:15.833 --> 11:17.666
Money isn't everything.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.583
- It is
when you haven't got it.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.958
Here, this is all I have.

11:51.041 --> 11:52.666
Here, take it.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.375
Take it, please.
Ah!

11:54.458 --> 11:55.791
I don't want your junk.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.750
- I want the money.
- Mrs. Bauer?

11:57.833 --> 11:59.333
- What's happening?
- Huh?

11:59.416 --> 12:00.750
I'll be back to get my money.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.583
Who was that man?

12:05.666 --> 12:07.875
- Tell them to go.
Make them go.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.250
Where did these come from?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.750
Now you know what I am.

12:14.833 --> 12:17.125
- I know you were
badly frightened.

12:17.208 --> 12:21.125
- Oh, no. I'm a thief.
A common thief.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.583
- Oh. I was looking
for Mrs. Russell.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.125
- She's gone with Mr. White,
sir.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.125
He's taken her
to see some pictures.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.333
- I don't like
the sound of that.

12:35.416 --> 12:39.000
- I'm afraid women
are an expensive hobby, sir.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.875
Especially pretty ones.

12:41.750 --> 12:42.833
I'm afraid they are.

12:44.166 --> 12:46.291
If you could ask her to come
and find me when she gets back.

12:46.375 --> 12:47.541
Of course, sir.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.583
- You mean to settle
in New York?

12:51.666 --> 12:52.875
I applied for a position.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.125
It's a bit early to assume
I'll get it.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.125
- So you might come here
to live?

12:56.208 --> 12:58.416
- Doubt I could manage the work
from Doylestown.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.791
- But why?
Aren't you happy there?

13:00.875 --> 13:02.625
Not as happy as I could be.

13:02.708 --> 13:04.125
Good evening, Mr. Oscar.

13:04.208 --> 13:05.500
- I like to think
you'd be pleased.

13:05.583 --> 13:06.791
Right this way.

13:08.375 --> 13:11.166
Mr. Van Rhijn
and Mr. Russell.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.333
Oscar?

13:12.416 --> 13:13.916
- May I present Mr. Russell,
Mama?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.375
We were
at the luncheon together,

13:15.458 --> 13:16.458
and he's anxious to know you.

13:16.541 --> 13:18.083
- I'm afraid I've rather
pushed into

13:18.166 --> 13:20.333
your tea party,
Mrs. Van Rhijn.

13:20.416 --> 13:23.125
- Don't worry.
We have so much cake.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.291
- Are you anything to do
with the Russells

13:26.375 --> 13:27.791
who live across the road?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.041
- I'm one of them.
- Oh.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.083
- This is my sister,
Miss Brook,

13:31.166 --> 13:32.750
and my niece,
Miss Marian Brook.

13:32.833 --> 13:33.875
Hello.

13:33.958 --> 13:37.166
- And Mr. Raikes is visiting
from Pennsylvania.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.500
But now I suppose
you'd better have some tea.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.291
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

13:43.750 --> 13:44.791
Pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Van Rhijn.

13:44.875 --> 13:45.875
How do you know my cousin?

13:45.958 --> 13:48.291
- We met in Newport
with Mrs. Fish.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.625
And then we were both
at a luncheon

13:49.708 --> 13:51.333
at the Union Club today.

13:51.416 --> 13:53.583
I didn't tell him
you and I had already met.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.625
I'm glad to see you here.

13:55.708 --> 13:58.000
- Judging by your aunt's face,
it'll be a while

13:58.083 --> 13:59.625
before you see me here again.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.500
- It is a small town.
And, of course, nothing like...

14:03.583 --> 14:06.083
- You just have to get them
back into the silver cupboard.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.875
But how will I manage it?

14:07.958 --> 14:09.083
How will you manage what?

14:11.791 --> 14:12.750
Tell me.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.083
- You don't want
to be involved.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.333
You don't know what I want.

14:15.416 --> 14:17.041
Tell her.

14:17.125 --> 14:20.000
I couldn't be more ashamed
than I am already.

14:27.958 --> 14:30.375
- Wish I understood
what brings you to New York.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.208
Simple. I want to be here.

14:32.291 --> 14:33.541
- And that's enough
of a reason?

14:33.625 --> 14:35.000
Course it is.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.625
It's always a reason
when you want something enough.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.791
When I see what I really want,
I take it if I can.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.625
- I suspect that's something
you should try to control

14:42.708 --> 14:45.000
if you don't intend
to spend time in a police cell.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.166
So when did you decide
to come to New York?

14:51.250 --> 14:53.291
- It's always been
a dream of mine.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.291
It's become real
comparatively recently.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.208
I see.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.458
- I wish I could convince you
that I mean to be your friend.

15:03.166 --> 15:06.500
- Oddly enough, there is
something you can do for me.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.916
There's a woman who works here
who did me a very good turn,

15:09.000 --> 15:10.916
and it seems she wants
your advice.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.916
- Do you know what it's about?
- No.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.750
But she'll have a solid reason.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.916
I should tell you,
she's colored.

15:18.041 --> 15:19.250
I see.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.166
- She's keen to see a lawyer
who's familiar

15:21.250 --> 15:22.833
with the laws of Pennsylvania.

15:22.916 --> 15:24.500
I don't know why.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.583
- "Curiouser and curiouser,"
said Alice.

15:26.666 --> 15:27.833
- If you don't like
the sound of it,

15:27.916 --> 15:31.166
could you suggest someone who
might handle cases like hers?

15:31.250 --> 15:33.166
But if even that's a nuisance,
I'll understand.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.500
I've told her
it's a lot to ask.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.541
- Nothing is a nuisance
if it gives me the chance

15:36.625 --> 15:37.833
to see you again.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.416
Bring her
to the Bethesda Fountain

15:41.500 --> 15:44.625
in Central Park
tomorrow afternoon at 3:00.

15:44.708 --> 15:45.916
I'll wait for you.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.625
- You're clever to know it.
I don't.

15:47.708 --> 15:48.958
You do now.

15:49.041 --> 15:51.000
I'll see you there.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.458
Bye, Mr. Raikes.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.333
What can have possessed you?

16:04.416 --> 16:06.541
- He's a very handsome
young man.

16:06.625 --> 16:07.875
You know we met in Newport.

16:07.958 --> 16:09.708
So when I saw him
at Ogden's luncheon,

16:09.791 --> 16:11.541
it seemed the obvious thing
to do.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.583
And I think we should know
the Russell family.

16:13.666 --> 16:15.041
I would go further and say

16:15.125 --> 16:16.458
I think it is mad
that we don't.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.041
- You mean you want to know
their daughter.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.375
- When I saw Larry again today,
I asked him here for tea.

16:20.458 --> 16:21.541
<i>Et voilà.</i>

16:21.625 --> 16:24.208
- While I am struggling,
trying to hold back

16:24.291 --> 16:27.083
the tide of vulgarians
that threatens to engulf us.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.000
I feel like King Canute.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.375
- Your policies make
as much sense as his did.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.708
- Now the mother
will try to use it

16:32.791 --> 16:35.125
to push in here, you'll see.

16:35.208 --> 16:36.666
- Has the lawyer gone?
- He has.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.541
I thought he was very nice.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.208
- I hope I'm not going to have
to speak to you again, Ada.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.250
No, Agnes.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.833
He may be moving to New York.

16:43.916 --> 16:45.583
- He will not trouble you
if he does.

16:45.666 --> 16:47.125
What do you mean?

16:47.208 --> 16:49.416
- New York is a collection
of villages, my dear.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.583
We know the people
who live in our own village.

16:51.666 --> 16:53.083
But not the ones who don't.

16:53.166 --> 16:55.750
- The Russells live
in your village, Mama.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.041
I could throw a stone from here
and break their windows.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.583
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not.

16:59.666 --> 17:00.875
I'm stating facts.

17:00.958 --> 17:02.833
I'm not concerned with facts.

17:02.916 --> 17:04.833
Not if they interfere
with my beliefs.

17:04.916 --> 17:06.708
- I give you prejudice
in a nut shell.

17:06.791 --> 17:08.791
- Oh, stop talking to yourself
and ring the bell.

17:08.875 --> 17:11.375
- I'm going up to change.
- I doubt it, Mama.

17:11.458 --> 17:14.208
I'd say you'll come down again
without having changed at all.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.458
So this is what Dido felt

17:38.541 --> 17:39.791
when she was about
to throw herself

17:39.875 --> 17:42.166
- onto the flaming pyre.
- Chin up.

17:42.250 --> 17:43.750
It'll be so awkward.

17:43.833 --> 17:45.291
- If it is, it won't be
the first awkward dinner

17:45.375 --> 17:46.666
we've sat through.

17:46.750 --> 17:47.791
Think of your Aunt Susan.

17:47.875 --> 17:51.083
Oh, you love to tease.

17:51.166 --> 17:53.208
Mr. and Mrs. Morris, welcome.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.583
Do you think we should kneel?

18:04.666 --> 18:05.833
What's that?

18:05.916 --> 18:07.875
- Mrs. Morris was admiring
your house.

18:07.958 --> 18:09.916
- Oh, we're still trying
to get organized.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.708
Please,
come into the drawing room.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.541
Ah, here's Mr. Russell.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.333
- Mr. Morris.
- Mr. Russell.

18:21.541 --> 18:23.458
- Where is the bazaar
to be held?

18:23.541 --> 18:25.541
- In the new armory
on Park Avenue.

18:25.625 --> 18:26.708
How interesting.

18:26.791 --> 18:27.750
Mr. White worked on that,

18:27.833 --> 18:29.125
the man who built this house.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.291
- Why didn't you choose
Richard Morris Hunt?

18:31.375 --> 18:33.708
- People expected us to,
but I like Mr. White.

18:33.791 --> 18:35.333
He seems very unafraid.

18:35.416 --> 18:38.083
- He is unafraid of decoration,
certainly.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.833
- Did Morris Hunt
build your house?

18:42.916 --> 18:44.958
- He did,
but for the Henry Lowells,

18:45.041 --> 18:47.208
so we avoided
the pangs of childbirth.

18:47.291 --> 18:49.333
- Still, it's harder to make it
one's own, isn't it,

18:49.416 --> 18:50.583
when it wasn't built for you?

18:50.666 --> 18:53.041
- Is Morris Hunt a relation?
- No.

18:53.125 --> 18:55.958
- Oh, I suppose Morris
is quite a common name.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.500
This is really delicious.

19:00.583 --> 19:02.041
I can't remember
when I've eaten better.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.416
- Thank you. I'll tell Baudin.
He'll be delighted.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.791
Your chef is French?

19:05.875 --> 19:07.291
Isn't everyone's these days?

19:07.375 --> 19:09.666
- It seems
quite a luxury to me.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.000
We feel it's worth it.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.666
- Well, don't let's overlook
the cost.

19:13.750 --> 19:17.083
- Well, it's excellent,
which is all that matters.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.958
Is the armory settled now?

19:19.041 --> 19:20.500
- Mrs. Druett is sure
it will be,

19:20.583 --> 19:22.041
and her husband
is on the board.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.500
- If anything goes wrong,
you can use the ballroom here.

19:24.583 --> 19:25.875
We'll show you after dinner.

19:25.958 --> 19:29.666
- You plan entertain, then?
- When the time is right.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.250
- I'm afraid New York can be
quite challenging at first.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.583
Can it?

19:33.666 --> 19:35.541
We haven't found it so.
Have we, George?

19:35.625 --> 19:38.625
- There is no challenge
you are not equal to, my dear.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.083
Mm.

19:50.666 --> 19:53.208
- When will you christen it?
- We haven't decided.

19:53.291 --> 19:57.208
- I expect you're rather sorry
you settled on the armory.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.208
- There's something
I'd like to talk to you about

19:59.291 --> 20:01.208
if I could detach you
from the ladies for a moment.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.666
Of course.

20:02.750 --> 20:05.083
- Please excuse us.
- This way.

20:06.958 --> 20:08.916
- I hope you'll come
to the bazaar.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.541
- I'm rather sorry
I couldn't be part of it.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.291
It seems a sensible cause
for once.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.000
I think so.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.750
It seems the two charities
were covering

20:15.833 --> 20:17.500
exactly the same ground.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.291
Well, the offer stands.

20:19.375 --> 20:22.041
If the armory falls through,
you can always come here.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.958
- That is very generous,
Mrs. Russell.

20:24.041 --> 20:25.958
I almost wish we would.

20:28.041 --> 20:30.333
- Gambling?
- It's mainly cards.

20:30.416 --> 20:31.958
Street games
where anyone can play

20:32.041 --> 20:33.583
if they only have
a few nickels.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.375
Why do the police allow it?

20:35.458 --> 20:37.541
- I'd say they do more
than allow it.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.250
How much did she lose?

20:39.333 --> 20:42.083
- Every time she tried to say
the sum, the tears came.

20:42.166 --> 20:43.916
Bridget found some brandy
in the store cupboard.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.208
Did she tell you in the end?

20:46.291 --> 20:48.083
About $50.

20:48.166 --> 20:51.500
- That's why she was crying.
- $50?

20:53.291 --> 20:55.291
The men she owes
will not be kind.

20:55.375 --> 20:58.000
- No.
I've seen that for myself.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.541
Can't we help her?

20:59.625 --> 21:01.125
They like her so much
downstairs,

21:01.208 --> 21:03.708
and I'd hate to see her sacked.

21:03.791 --> 21:06.208
Let me think.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.666
And don't forget
our appointment tomorrow.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.500
- What will you tell
your aunts?

21:10.583 --> 21:12.333
I'll say I'm going for a walk

21:12.416 --> 21:14.500
and that I've asked you
to accompany me.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.625
- And you don't mind lying
to them?

21:16.708 --> 21:18.208
Don't put it like that.

21:19.416 --> 21:20.666
I'm just...

21:20.750 --> 21:22.541
trying to live my life.

21:23.708 --> 21:26.083
- Miss Scott, you shouldn't
be doing that now.

21:26.166 --> 21:27.750
It's far too late.

21:27.833 --> 21:30.458
And don't let
Miss Marian distract you.

21:30.541 --> 21:32.166
I've finished for the night.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.250
- Tomorrow I want you
to go through these.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.375
Letters from
assorted presidents,

21:36.458 --> 21:39.500
secretaries of state,
artists in need of a patron,

21:39.583 --> 21:41.041
that sort of thing.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.041
- How interesting.
- Hmm.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.083
If only Mr. Oscar agreed
with you.

21:46.666 --> 21:49.791
- I do know you've taken
a chance on me, Mrs. Van Rhijn.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.458
And I appreciate it.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.958
- Life has taught me one thing,
Miss Scott.

21:54.041 --> 21:56.000
If you don't want
to be disappointed,

21:56.083 --> 21:58.458
only help those
who help themselves.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.041
And now I'm going to bed.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.291
So there'll be another line

22:04.375 --> 22:06.166
direct from New York
to Chicago.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.375
- That's it.
Through Pennsylvania.

22:08.458 --> 22:10.041
Along the south shore
of Lake Erie.

22:10.125 --> 22:11.708
Across northing Ohio
and Indiana

22:11.791 --> 22:13.458
and on to Chicago
and St. Louis.

22:13.541 --> 22:16.500
- What about the railroads
that already cover the area?

22:16.583 --> 22:18.083
We can manage those.

22:18.166 --> 22:21.208
- And you want to build
a new station in the city?

22:21.291 --> 22:23.416
Which is where you come in.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.083
- Even if I were able
to persuade my fellow aldermen

22:26.166 --> 22:27.416
to pass the law,

22:27.500 --> 22:29.416
I don't quite see--

22:29.500 --> 22:32.708
well, not to put too fine
a point on it.

22:32.791 --> 22:34.750
- You mean
what's in it for them?

22:34.833 --> 22:36.000
Mm.

22:37.666 --> 22:39.208
- Any shares you buy
in the company now

22:39.291 --> 22:41.541
should go sky-high
when the bill is passed.

22:41.625 --> 22:43.166
- But suppose it would be hard
for some of us

22:43.250 --> 22:44.750
to raise the money.

22:44.833 --> 22:47.208
- I imagine you have
a margin account.

22:47.291 --> 22:49.416
Surely most of them do.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.416
- You mean we should
buy shares now on margin

22:51.500 --> 22:53.000
and then pass the law?

22:53.083 --> 22:54.833
- I'm not telling you
to do anything.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.791
And when it comes into law,

22:56.875 --> 22:58.166
the shares will go
through the ceiling.

22:58.250 --> 23:00.666
So there's no risk
in my buying on margin,

23:00.750 --> 23:03.208
as I'll never have to raise
the money to cover it.

23:03.291 --> 23:05.291
That's what you're saying.

23:05.375 --> 23:06.541
I repeat.

23:07.541 --> 23:09.875
I am not giving you
any kind of instruction.

23:11.208 --> 23:13.583
- This is why we're not meeting
in your office.

23:14.833 --> 23:16.958
You look very serious.

23:17.041 --> 23:19.083
Not serious, thoughtful.

23:19.166 --> 23:20.583
- Well, I'm afraid
you're going to have to take

23:20.666 --> 23:21.916
your thoughts home, Mr. Morris.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.083
Mrs. Morris is tired.

23:23.166 --> 23:25.000
I'm to tell you
she wants to leave.

23:25.083 --> 23:27.166
- Well, I hope she's thanked
you for our wonderful evening.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.750
You'll let me know?

23:30.833 --> 23:32.541
Yes. I'll let you know.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.583
Congratulations, my dear.

23:39.666 --> 23:42.500
An excellent dinner,
brilliantly orchestrated.

23:42.583 --> 23:43.666
Hmm.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.958
- I think you've caught me
the fish I was after.

23:46.041 --> 23:47.416
I'm glad.

23:53.583 --> 23:56.291
Well, they've gone.

23:56.375 --> 23:58.458
The master and mistress are
having a drink in the library

23:58.541 --> 24:02.958
to recover, but well done,
monsieur, a triumphant evening.

24:03.041 --> 24:05.291
- You hear that,
Monsieur Baudin?

24:05.375 --> 24:07.458
What a comfort it is to know
that all the hard work

24:07.541 --> 24:09.083
has been worthwhile.

24:09.166 --> 24:10.541
Has it?

24:14.083 --> 24:16.125
- Marian said you wanted
to see me?

24:16.208 --> 24:17.416
Shut the door.

24:19.041 --> 24:22.125
Now, I need
to make one thing clear.

24:22.208 --> 24:25.541
You are not to encourage Marian
over that tiresome young man.

24:25.625 --> 24:27.375
- Oh, but I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

24:27.458 --> 24:28.708
"How nice he is.

24:28.791 --> 24:31.916
What fun it will be for her
to have a friend in the city."

24:32.000 --> 24:33.708
- But it will be.
- Ada...

24:33.791 --> 24:35.208
she hasn't a penny.

24:35.291 --> 24:37.333
And I can't leave her
any of the Van Rhijn money,

24:37.416 --> 24:39.708
which should and will
go to Oscar.

24:39.791 --> 24:41.708
- What will happen to me?
- Oh.

24:41.791 --> 24:43.833
Don't worry about that.
I will outlive you.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.041
Now, as I was saying.

24:45.125 --> 24:48.416
Marian has no income,
and her birth--

24:48.500 --> 24:50.041
thanks to her mother--

24:50.125 --> 24:51.458
is not impeccable.

24:51.541 --> 24:53.500
In short,
without a decent marriage,

24:53.583 --> 24:55.125
she will be lost.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.333
But he's a lawyer.

24:56.416 --> 24:58.166
- Oh, if you ask me,
he's a shyster

24:58.250 --> 24:59.541
with neither background
nor fortune.

24:59.625 --> 25:00.541
It's obvious.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.333
He sees her as a ticket
out of Doylestown.

25:02.416 --> 25:04.750
- But if they like
each other...

25:06.041 --> 25:08.583
Marrying for money
is not always

25:08.666 --> 25:11.166
a guarantee of happiness,
Agnes.

25:12.541 --> 25:15.458
- I don't wish her
to marry for money.

25:15.541 --> 25:19.916
Only to marry for security,
support,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.250
and, God willing, affection.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.000
Would you deny her that?

25:25.625 --> 25:26.583
Of course not.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.708
Then good night.

25:44.625 --> 25:46.208
- I'm afraid
we're a little late.

25:46.291 --> 25:47.250
I'm sure he'll wait.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.833
How is Mrs. Bauer today?

25:48.916 --> 25:50.416
- I believe
she put the silver back,

25:50.500 --> 25:52.541
but in despair
about everything else.

25:52.625 --> 25:53.833
I can find the money.

25:53.916 --> 25:55.291
I just have to figure out
how to get it

25:55.375 --> 25:57.208
without telling anyone
why I need it.

25:57.291 --> 26:00.000
- I don't believe in secrets.
- Really?

26:00.083 --> 26:02.000
- I don't believe in them
because they never work.

26:02.083 --> 26:04.500
Everything always comes out
in the end.

26:04.583 --> 26:05.625
You should know.

26:05.708 --> 26:07.416
You keep secrets
better than most.

26:12.791 --> 26:14.541
Ha!

26:14.625 --> 26:17.541
It's wonderful.
When was it built?

26:17.625 --> 26:19.583
- It was finished
almost ten years ago.

26:19.666 --> 26:21.583
And the statue at the top
was made by a woman.

26:21.666 --> 26:23.166
You'll like that.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.291
I do like it. Who was she?

26:25.375 --> 26:26.833
Emma Stebbins,

26:26.916 --> 26:28.833
the first woman to receive
a sculptural commission

26:28.916 --> 26:30.750
in New York City.

26:30.833 --> 26:32.833
- I hope you just read that
in the guidebook.

26:34.083 --> 26:35.833
- I did.

26:35.916 --> 26:38.000
- What a relief.
You scared me for a moment.

26:39.708 --> 26:40.708
This is Miss Scott.

26:40.791 --> 26:42.041
Good day, Miss Scott.

26:42.125 --> 26:43.541
I gather that you wish
to ask for my help.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.958
- If you don't see it
as impertinent, sir.

26:46.041 --> 26:47.791
- As a matter of fact,
I'm curious.

26:47.875 --> 26:50.333
- Thank you.
- Then I'll leave you to it.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.416
Hello, Miss Brook.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.750
Miss Russell.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.083
- This is my mother's maid,
Turner.

27:08.166 --> 27:10.458
She's been kind enough
to take me to a fitting.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.000
Give us a moment, will you?

27:13.875 --> 27:15.375
She was really spying on me
for my mother

27:15.458 --> 27:17.708
to make sure
I didn't change the design.

27:17.791 --> 27:19.541
I saw your brother yesterday.

27:19.625 --> 27:20.833
He said.

27:20.916 --> 27:23.583
Although he doesn't expect
to be asked back anytime soon.

27:23.666 --> 27:25.333
He had dinner
with your cousin last night

27:25.416 --> 27:26.583
at the Knickerbocker.

27:26.666 --> 27:27.916
Mr. Van Rhijn came
across the street

27:28.000 --> 27:29.833
- and they went together.
- Hmm.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.500
He did make me laugh.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.416
- Yes,
Oscar can be quite witty.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.458
I thought he was charming.

27:35.541 --> 27:36.875
He wanted me
to join them for dinner,

27:36.958 --> 27:38.833
but, of course,
it was out of the question.

27:38.916 --> 27:41.000
How strange these rules are.

27:41.083 --> 27:42.166
Why shouldn't you
go out to dinner

27:42.250 --> 27:43.250
with your brother
and a friend?

27:43.333 --> 27:44.458
What could be more normal?

27:44.541 --> 27:45.750
Not to my mother.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.541
Look. Is that man trying
to catch your attention?

27:49.625 --> 27:50.791
I think he is.

27:50.875 --> 27:53.083
Good day, Miss Russell.

27:53.166 --> 27:54.875
I suspect you ought
to keep an eye on her.

27:54.958 --> 27:56.125
I will.

28:01.583 --> 28:02.791
Is everything settled?

28:02.875 --> 28:04.291
- Miss Scott is going
to write to me.

28:04.375 --> 28:05.916
- You must promise
to send a bill.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.791
Don't worry about that.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.750
And now this really is goodbye.

28:09.833 --> 28:11.125
Had my final interview
this morning

28:11.208 --> 28:12.625
and I leave for home tomorrow.

28:12.708 --> 28:14.541
- I hope you have plans
for tonight.

28:14.625 --> 28:15.708
How could I?

28:15.791 --> 28:18.125
I don't know anyone
in New York except you.

28:18.208 --> 28:20.041
Well, that'll soon change

28:20.125 --> 28:21.708
if you come here to live.

28:21.791 --> 28:24.083
New York has plenty
to offer the new arrival.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.416
- But what would I have
to offer New York?

28:28.041 --> 28:30.041
- You'll let us know
how it turns out?

28:30.125 --> 28:32.083
- Promise?
- Promise.

28:32.166 --> 28:33.833
You'll be the first person
I tell.

28:48.708 --> 28:49.958
- Miss Scott.
- Jack.

28:50.041 --> 28:52.458
- You were in a hurry
when you left this afternoon.

28:52.541 --> 28:54.416
- We were late
for Mr. Raikes and--

28:54.500 --> 28:56.125
Mr. Raikes?

28:56.208 --> 28:58.000
Miss Marian's lawyer?

28:58.083 --> 29:00.083
- He returns to Pennsylvania
in the morning.

29:00.166 --> 29:01.291
She wanted to say goodbye.

29:01.375 --> 29:02.791
I bet she did.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.291
She took her time
saying goodbye to him

29:04.375 --> 29:05.708
when he was here yesterday.

29:05.791 --> 29:07.083
I had to leave them to it
in the hall.

29:07.166 --> 29:09.375
- And where did
she meet him today?

29:09.458 --> 29:11.583
- The Bethesda Fountain
in Central Park.

29:11.666 --> 29:14.958
- Why did you say "we"
were late for Mr. Raikes?

29:15.041 --> 29:17.750
Did I? I meant she was late.

29:17.833 --> 29:19.000
But then why say "we"?

29:19.083 --> 29:20.833
Oh, for heaven's sake.

29:20.916 --> 29:22.500
She kept Miss Marian company

29:22.583 --> 29:24.833
so she could say goodbye
to an old friend.

29:24.916 --> 29:26.666
You know Mrs. Van Rhijn
doesn't like her

29:26.750 --> 29:29.333
- to go out alone.
- I was just asking.

29:29.416 --> 29:30.875
Well, don't.

29:35.666 --> 29:38.166
- Cousin Oscar, I didn't know
you were here for dinner.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.958
- I hope
you're not disappointed.

29:40.041 --> 29:41.500
Quite the contrary.

29:42.625 --> 29:45.041
As a matter of fact,
I need your advice.

29:45.125 --> 29:47.166
- How intriguing.
- We have a problem.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.125
And I want to spare Aunt Agnes
any concern.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.250
- Your coachman
let me wait in here.

30:00.333 --> 30:01.875
I said
you were expecting me.

30:01.958 --> 30:03.250
Is that so?

30:03.333 --> 30:06.083
I must teach him to be more
circumspect in the future.

30:12.708 --> 30:15.541
- We're buying shares now.
All of us.

30:15.625 --> 30:17.000
- When will you announce
the law?

30:17.083 --> 30:19.500
- I'll send a message
when I settle the date.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.041
But there are no objections?

30:21.125 --> 30:23.833
No, not to the plan.

30:23.916 --> 30:25.666
Only to me.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.958
- I'm afraid they're
very snobbish, Mr. Russell.

30:28.041 --> 30:29.541
Are they?

30:31.375 --> 30:33.291
Well, maybe
they're right to be.

30:35.666 --> 30:37.750
Where would you like me
to take you?

30:37.833 --> 30:39.375
Put me down here.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.583
- Stop here, Johnson.
- Whoa!

30:44.875 --> 30:46.416
Good day to you, Mr. Russell.

30:48.333 --> 30:49.708
- A good day for us all,
I think.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.583
- You asked for my advice,
but...

31:07.666 --> 31:10.041
what you really want
is my money.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.958
Why can't Mama pay the debt?

31:12.041 --> 31:14.958
- Because if she knew about it,
she'd dismiss Mrs. Bauer.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.166
And we'd have to break in
a new cook.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.791
- Ah.
I suspect you're softhearted.

31:19.875 --> 31:21.125
I think you feel sorry
for the woman

31:21.208 --> 31:22.625
and don't want her
to lose her job.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.166
No, I don't.

31:25.375 --> 31:27.875
- And would my $50
ever be repaid?

31:27.958 --> 31:28.958
It will.

31:29.041 --> 31:31.416
It may take time,
but I have an allowance.

31:32.375 --> 31:33.625
Hmm.

31:36.083 --> 31:38.666
I wonder if you'd do me
a favor in return.

31:38.750 --> 31:40.208
Of course, if I can.

31:40.291 --> 31:41.750
Then give a luncheon party.

31:41.833 --> 31:44.250
And invite Miss Gladys Russell.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.583
Would she be allowed to come?

31:45.666 --> 31:47.083
- She'd be allowed
to lunch with you.

31:48.458 --> 31:50.041
- But don't you already
know her?

31:50.125 --> 31:51.583
Mm, not well enough.

31:51.666 --> 31:53.541
Let me sit next to her,

31:53.625 --> 31:55.125
and you can save Mrs. Bauer.

31:55.208 --> 31:57.416
That is my final offer.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.125
What's all this?

31:59.208 --> 32:01.166
Never mind, Aunt Ada.

32:01.250 --> 32:04.375
Cousin Marian and I
are just seeing eye to eye.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I saw Charles Fane today.

32:09.083 --> 32:10.666
He said the armory's
fallen through.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.625
It's so tiresome.

32:12.708 --> 32:14.375
It turns out it was
double-booked.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.750
They're very sorry, but
I'm afraid they won't budge.

32:16.833 --> 32:18.166
And we can't change the date.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.625
So what happens now?

32:19.708 --> 32:21.625
- We'll go
to the Fifth Avenue Hotel.

32:21.708 --> 32:24.833
We'll have to pay, of course,
so the profit will come down.

32:24.916 --> 32:27.666
It's really too annoying
to be borne.

32:27.750 --> 32:29.625
- You were offered
Mrs. Russell's ballroom

32:29.708 --> 32:31.625
- for nothing.
- I know, but--

32:31.708 --> 32:33.208
- But what?
It's a lot more splendid

32:33.291 --> 32:35.083
than some down-at-heel hotel.

32:35.166 --> 32:37.500
- It wasn't my decision.
I had to defer to Aurora.

32:37.583 --> 32:40.291
- She'd never
have gone against you.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.708
Why do you care?

32:41.791 --> 32:44.208
- I don't want to annoy
George Russell.

32:44.291 --> 32:45.416
Not at the moment.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.375
- Well, I'm afraid
you're too late.

32:47.458 --> 32:50.000
We're going to the hotel.
It's all settled.

32:51.666 --> 32:52.791
Pity.

33:03.583 --> 33:06.166
- May I have a word?
- Of course.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.083
- The money you were going
to borrow from Oscar--

33:08.166 --> 33:09.458
How did you find out?

33:09.541 --> 33:11.916
- I could see something was up
when I came into the room,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.333
so I got it out of him
after dinner.

33:14.416 --> 33:17.000
Anyway, I told him
I would prefer to pay

33:17.083 --> 33:18.958
Mrs. Bauer's debt myself.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.875
I'm relieved.

33:20.958 --> 33:22.083
But can you manage it?

33:22.166 --> 33:24.875
- I'm not quite penniless,
thank you.

33:24.958 --> 33:27.750
Whatever Agnes likes to imply.

33:27.833 --> 33:29.041
But next time,

33:29.125 --> 33:30.291
please come to me first.

33:30.375 --> 33:31.583
I will.

33:31.666 --> 33:34.708
I would have felt very guilty
selling Gladys Russell to him.

33:34.791 --> 33:36.916
She deserves better
than a fortune hunter.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.416
Or shouldn't I say that?

33:39.500 --> 33:41.041
You can say it to me.

33:42.166 --> 33:44.541
But what I don't understand
is how Mrs. Bauer

33:44.625 --> 33:46.708
fell into debt
in the first place.

33:46.791 --> 33:47.958
And will it happen again?

33:48.041 --> 33:49.625
I don't think so.

33:49.708 --> 33:51.875
She's been foolish,
by her own admission.

33:51.958 --> 33:54.041
But she means to do better
in the future.

33:54.125 --> 33:55.625
Let us pray.

33:56.666 --> 33:58.875
- I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

33:58.958 --> 34:01.291
- You make it up to me
by being here.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.916
- Aunt Ada,
can I ask you something?

34:06.875 --> 34:08.666
You told me Aunt Agnes
hated my father

34:08.750 --> 34:10.166
because he sold
our family house

34:10.250 --> 34:12.791
and abdicated
his responsibility toward you.

34:12.875 --> 34:14.291
I did.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.333
Do you feel the same?

34:16.416 --> 34:18.333
About Daddy?

34:20.208 --> 34:23.125
It's different for me.

34:23.208 --> 34:25.458
Agnes has always carried
the weight of the world

34:25.541 --> 34:27.000
on her shoulders.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.250
I was the baby.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.458
Henry used to tease me
and make me laugh.

34:34.666 --> 34:36.583
So no.

34:36.666 --> 34:38.416
I don't feel the same way.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.083
- Now I have a question.
- Hmm?

34:44.166 --> 34:46.625
- Have you heard back
from Mr. Raikes?

34:46.708 --> 34:48.708
Not yet.

34:48.791 --> 34:51.041
Please.

34:51.125 --> 34:53.833
Be kind to your Aunt Agnes
when you do.

34:53.916 --> 34:55.625
Will she be kind to me?

34:57.375 --> 35:00.583
- All we both want
is your happiness.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.000
You may disagree with us.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.166
But that is all we want.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.791
Please remember it.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.583
Good night, my dear.

35:12.708 --> 35:13.791
Good night.

35:15.208 --> 35:16.375
And, Aunt Ada.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.500
I love you.

35:20.708 --> 35:22.125
I mean it.

35:22.208 --> 35:24.166
- You wouldn't say it
if you did not.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.708
- Well, it does
feel much smaller than...

36:32.791 --> 36:34.250
I hope it won't be too...

36:35.333 --> 36:37.875
How beautiful.

36:37.958 --> 36:39.708
It's so pretty.

36:39.791 --> 36:41.916
- Look over here.
- Oh, beautiful.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.416
Do show me how.

36:47.125 --> 36:48.125
How lovely.

36:48.208 --> 36:49.750
- I think I'll just put
a few out at a time.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.750
Otherwise they look
a bit ordinary.

36:51.833 --> 36:53.708
I'll replace them
as they sell.

36:54.708 --> 36:56.958
- Are you quite ready?
- Almost.

36:57.041 --> 36:58.791
- We're about to open
the doors.

36:58.875 --> 37:00.500
- It's a shame
about the armory.

37:00.583 --> 37:01.625
I know.

37:01.708 --> 37:03.458
We should have accepted
Mrs. Russell's offer,

37:03.541 --> 37:05.125
but Anne Morris
wouldn't hear of it.

37:05.208 --> 37:06.125
What offer?

37:06.208 --> 37:07.791
- She said we could use
her ballroom.

37:07.875 --> 37:09.291
- Wouldn't that
have been better?

37:09.375 --> 37:11.750
- Anne said
we would have been indebted.

37:11.833 --> 37:15.083
Oh, look, here's Mrs. Astor.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.500
Right on time.

37:16.583 --> 37:17.916
Isn't she a marvel?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
A queen among her people.

37:21.666 --> 37:24.083
You are so good and kind
to come.

37:24.166 --> 37:26.916
- Nonsense.
It is what I do.

37:29.250 --> 37:32.916
- Mrs. Astor has agreed
to open the bazaar.

37:33.041 --> 37:36.166
What clearer sign can there be
to show us the value

37:36.250 --> 37:38.125
of our endeavors?

37:38.208 --> 37:39.916
Mrs. Astor?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.541
- I have no speech
beyond a simple desire

37:42.625 --> 37:44.375
that you should spend
what you can

37:44.458 --> 37:46.750
to help
these distressed mothers

37:46.833 --> 37:48.458
and their unhappy children.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.041
So saying,

37:51.125 --> 37:54.791
I declare this bazaar
well and truly open.

38:16.166 --> 38:17.625
- Good morning,
Mrs. Chamberlain.

38:19.208 --> 38:22.083
- You are both polite
and brave, Miss Brook,

38:22.166 --> 38:23.208
since I'm quite sure

38:23.291 --> 38:25.166
Mrs. Van Rhijn
has warned you against me.

38:25.250 --> 38:26.916
- You're clever to know
who I am.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.166
- I know a lot of what goes on
in this city.

38:30.708 --> 38:32.541
Your things are charming.

38:32.625 --> 38:35.541
Let me buy these.

38:35.625 --> 38:36.708
Here.

38:36.791 --> 38:38.291
- It's five cents
for each packet.

38:38.375 --> 38:40.916
- Keep it.
The cause is a good one.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.916
You are very kind.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.041
No, you are kind.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.708
I wish you would
come and call on me,

38:48.791 --> 38:50.875
but I suppose that is
out of the question.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.625
I must leave you, as I think

38:55.708 --> 38:57.791
you are about to pay
for this exchange.

39:02.666 --> 39:04.500
- Why were you talking
to that woman?

39:04.583 --> 39:06.458
- I'm selling handkerchiefs
for charity,

39:06.541 --> 39:08.666
- and she bought some.
- I see I must be blunt.

39:08.750 --> 39:12.416
Mrs. Chamberlain has things,
terrible things, in her past

39:12.500 --> 39:14.750
which render her unsuitable
as an acquaintance

39:14.833 --> 39:16.416
for any well-brought-up
young lady.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.750
- My father would be flattered.
- Marian, I'm serious.

39:18.833 --> 39:21.166
Mrs. Chamberlain's money
is tainted.

39:21.250 --> 39:22.500
- If you were living
in one room

39:22.583 --> 39:23.708
with neither heat nor water,

39:23.791 --> 39:25.583
I'm sure
you would not find it so.

39:25.666 --> 39:27.125
Oh, look.

39:27.208 --> 39:29.750
- Oh, first Mrs. Chamberlain
and now them.

39:29.833 --> 39:32.000
Why don't we just go outside
and roam in the gutter?

39:32.083 --> 39:33.250
It will save time.

39:33.333 --> 39:36.875
- Remember, Agnes, charity
is the order of the day.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.083
- I do not know
how much more I can take.

39:39.166 --> 39:40.083
Try to remain calm.

39:40.166 --> 39:42.333
- Marian.
- Oscar.

39:44.166 --> 39:45.333
You should know,

39:45.416 --> 39:47.625
Aunt Ada is going to pay
Mrs. Bauer's debt.

39:48.875 --> 39:50.916
- Then I must use
every opportunity.

39:55.375 --> 39:56.791
Miss Russell.

39:56.875 --> 39:58.125
How well you look.

39:58.208 --> 40:00.416
Mother, may I present
Mr. Van Rhijn?

40:00.500 --> 40:01.500
- How do you know my daughter,
sir?

40:01.583 --> 40:02.875
Well, I don't. Not really.

40:02.958 --> 40:04.625
But, uh, I want to. Very much.

40:04.708 --> 40:07.000
- We cannot always have
what we want.

40:07.083 --> 40:08.666
- Oh, Mother,
Mr. Van Rhijn is teasing.

40:08.750 --> 40:09.791
He's a friend of Larry's.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.291
We met when he came by
the other evening

40:11.375 --> 40:12.375
to take Larry for dinner.

40:12.458 --> 40:14.041
You know Mr. Van Rhijn
is our neighbor.

40:14.125 --> 40:15.916
Or at least, my mother is.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.458
I was saying to Miss Russell,
we should all

40:17.541 --> 40:18.791
see more of each other.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.041
Maybe.

40:26.416 --> 40:28.833
- Dare I say
we have outdone ourselves?

40:28.916 --> 40:31.041
Yes, I think so too.

40:31.125 --> 40:33.666
Mrs. Morris. Good morning.

40:33.750 --> 40:34.958
Is Mr. Morris here?

40:35.041 --> 40:36.500
He's hoping to look in later.

40:36.583 --> 40:37.541
Then he may miss it.

40:37.625 --> 40:40.166
- I don't understand.
- You will.

40:40.250 --> 40:42.125
And you must be Mrs. Fane.

40:42.208 --> 40:44.458
- Yes, Mr. Russell,
I'm Aurora Fane.

40:44.541 --> 40:46.250
So the pair of you decided

40:46.333 --> 40:48.666
my wife's ballroom
was not good enough

40:48.750 --> 40:50.625
to raise money
for your charity?

40:50.708 --> 40:52.125
- Mr. Russell,
there's no need--

40:52.208 --> 40:53.666
- How much money
do you hope to raise

40:53.750 --> 40:55.791
over the next three days?

40:55.875 --> 40:59.125
- I suppose I'm hoping
for $30 or even $40.

40:59.208 --> 41:01.625
- Here's $100,
on one condition.

41:01.708 --> 41:03.041
What?

41:03.125 --> 41:05.041
- That everything on this stall
is delivered to my house

41:05.125 --> 41:06.750
on Fifth Avenue
within the hour.

41:06.833 --> 41:08.208
This is my card.

41:08.291 --> 41:10.875
- Can you do it?
- Uh, yes, I suppose we can.

41:10.958 --> 41:12.208
It is why we're here, isn't it?

41:12.291 --> 41:14.916
I mean, that is the point.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.500
- Of course!

41:17.583 --> 41:20.041
- So you'll take it.
- Thank you.

41:20.125 --> 41:21.375
Very generous.

41:21.458 --> 41:23.708
You will also close
and dismantle your stall.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.791
This is my address
on Fifth Avenue.

41:27.875 --> 41:29.125
- I see.
- $100.

41:29.208 --> 41:30.666
I'm buying everything,
but it must be delivered

41:30.750 --> 41:31.833
within the hour.

41:31.916 --> 41:34.000
And the stall will be closed
and taken down at once.

41:34.083 --> 41:35.333
As you wish.

41:37.750 --> 41:40.250
- I will buy everything
on your stall for $100.

41:40.333 --> 41:41.750
Please wrap it up...

41:41.833 --> 41:44.958
- Thank you, sir.

41:45.041 --> 41:46.583
- What have we here?
- Gloves, sir.

41:46.666 --> 41:47.916
I will take all of them.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.416
- Mrs. Russell,
can't you stop this?

41:49.500 --> 41:52.083
- Why? The bazaar will be the
most successful of the season.

41:52.166 --> 41:53.583
All right.

41:53.666 --> 41:55.958
- Madam, $100.
- It won't help you, you know.

41:56.041 --> 41:57.916
This sort of stunt
does not impress

41:58.000 --> 41:59.500
the people
you want to win over.

41:59.583 --> 42:02.500
- Mrs. Morris, this sort
of stunt impresses everyone.

42:08.333 --> 42:09.833
- I'm sure
your father means well,

42:09.916 --> 42:12.208
but I'm afraid his generosity
will close the bazaar

42:12.291 --> 42:14.208
before it's really begun.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.250
- I don't think
he means well at all.

42:17.333 --> 42:18.708
- No?
- No.

42:18.791 --> 42:20.750
- And I don't blame him
one little bit.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.416
$100, Miss Brook?

42:25.500 --> 42:26.833
I feel I should say $500,

42:26.916 --> 42:29.041
and we could transform
the whole endeavor.

42:29.125 --> 42:30.500
But I'll take $100.

42:32.541 --> 42:34.833
- Well,
I think that's everyone.

42:34.916 --> 42:36.291
- Can I help
with packing it up?

42:36.375 --> 42:37.791
Oh, no, I'm enjoying myself.

42:37.875 --> 42:40.583
It's not every day you watch
Sherman march into the sea.

42:42.375 --> 42:43.958
- Your party's over,
Mrs. Morris.

42:44.041 --> 42:45.750
You are to be congratulated.

42:45.833 --> 42:48.041
It's been a great success.

42:48.125 --> 42:50.291
And now it's time to go home.

42:50.375 --> 42:51.541
Are you ready, my dear?

42:53.583 --> 42:55.791
- Larry?
- You'd better go.

42:55.875 --> 42:57.750
Sherman's leaving.

42:57.833 --> 42:58.958
Miss Brook.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.541
Goodbye, my dear.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.583
You're not going.

43:06.666 --> 43:09.041
There's nothing to stay for.

43:09.125 --> 43:11.375
The lion has roared.

43:18.458 --> 43:21.000
- Seems to me
the ship is sinking.

43:21.083 --> 43:23.458
Let us follow
the example of rats.

43:23.541 --> 43:26.041
- I don't know
how nice that is, Agnes.

43:27.041 --> 43:29.041
Oh, I'm so sorry, apologies.

43:37.416 --> 43:39.666
Mama, you're back very early.

43:39.750 --> 43:42.125
I thought we were meeting
at Mrs. Morris' bazaar.

43:42.208 --> 43:44.208
The bazaar is over, my dear.

43:44.291 --> 43:46.333
Closed and finished.

43:46.416 --> 43:48.125
- What? I thought it was
to last three days.

43:48.208 --> 43:49.875
So it was.

43:49.958 --> 43:54.291
But a man called George Russell
decided otherwise.

43:54.375 --> 43:56.208
- I'd say they learned
their lesson.

43:57.666 --> 43:59.541
I think neither Mrs. Morris
nor Mrs. Fane

43:59.625 --> 44:01.583
will ever forget this one.

44:01.666 --> 44:03.916
<i>What was he like?</i>

44:04.000 --> 44:07.166
<i>- Well, yesterday I would</i>
<i>have said he was nobody.</i>

44:07.250 --> 44:08.875
But today?

44:08.958 --> 44:13.166
I'm obliged to concede that he
is someone to be reckoned with.

44:14.583 --> 44:15.708
And befriended?

44:15.791 --> 44:16.958
Oh, no.

44:17.041 --> 44:18.958
Not yet, at any rate.

44:19.041 --> 44:20.666
But we will hear of him again.

44:22.250 --> 44:24.041
I rather enjoyed myself.

44:24.125 --> 44:25.708
<i>And now...</i>

44:25.791 --> 44:29.541
I'm going upstairs
to take off my coat.

44:29.625 --> 44:32.083
I have a free morning.

44:32.166 --> 44:34.916
It is a treat to be savored.
