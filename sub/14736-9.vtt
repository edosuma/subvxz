Tradeskees is

my passion costs
about 150 bucks a month,

is refusing to raise

I believe in her,

02:51.552 --> 02:53.133
their guacamole
was terrible.

02:53.133 --> 02:55.175
That's because it was
an avocado face mask.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.559
Well, whatever it was,
it needed lime.

02:58.559 --> 03:00.931

It's at
Wild Wild Vest.

03:02.433 --> 03:05.065
Yes, they're
vests, what else
is there to know?

03:07.067 --> 03:09.149
Wow, there's
a lot to know
about vests.

03:10.441 --> 03:13.113

Those interviews
were just warm-ups.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.532

Hey there, friends.

use some free fudge.
 Don't mind if I do.

03:34.795 --> 03:36.257

really good.

03:38.929 --> 03:40.261
caramel,

toasted sesame?

03:42.343 --> 03:45.015

your fudge.

03:45.015 --> 03:47.107

Don Barnwell.

you're embarrassing me.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.278
My name's Jordan.
I'm the owner of
Fudgie Town.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.410
I don't suppose
I could interest
you in a job?

03:59.410 --> 04:01.412
Ooh, a job?
No, no thanks.

04:01.412 --> 04:04.915
I had a lemonade stand
when I was six,
I'm kinda burned out.

04:04.915 --> 04:08.959
But, Cyd, maybe
you know someone
who does want a job?

04:11.171 --> 04:12.583
Oh! Right, of course.

04:12.583 --> 04:14.585
Yes, my friend Shelby
here is looking
for a job

04:14.585 --> 04:16.837
and all the other people
who have rejected her today

04:16.837 --> 04:18.379
say she has
a lot of potential.

04:20.430 --> 04:23.263
I'll tell you what.
I'll hire you,

04:23.263 --> 04:24.975
if she comes with you.

04:24.975 --> 04:27.017
Cyd, please
do this for me.

Welcome to Fudgie Town.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.075
Hey, Barry.

04:50.411 --> 04:52.042
I have no time
for pleasantries.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.123
Something terrible
has happened!

04:53.123 --> 04:54.415
Did you fall
on the remote?

04:54.415 --> 04:55.506
Yes.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.631
Also, I'm failing
poetry class.

05:00.631 --> 05:03.764
My teacher,
Miss Wentworth,
says I lack imagination,

05:03.764 --> 05:08.599
and emotion and I'm
"alarmingly cynical"
for my age.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.311
I prefer to think of you
as charmingly cynical
for your age.

05:12.393 --> 05:14.855
Well, your blind
devotion to me aside,

05:14.855 --> 05:16.357
I'm getting an "F"

05:16.357 --> 05:18.859
and this notebook full of
bad poetry proves it.

05:21.031 --> 05:24.655
"Roses are red,
but in reality
they are all the colors.

05:24.655 --> 05:27.868
"Only the red wavelength
is reflected
back to the eye.

05:27.868 --> 05:29.079
"Fact."

05:30.621 --> 05:33.043
Okay, so you're
failing poetry.

05:33.043 --> 05:35.045
This is going
to ruin my
grade point average.

05:35.045 --> 05:36.547
A lifetime of hard work

05:36.547 --> 05:40.340
flushed down
the toilet

05:40.340 --> 05:42.633
Well, like a simile
a stupid poet would use.

05:49.269 --> 05:51.932
Well,
you definitely look like
Fudgie Town employees.

05:51.932 --> 05:55.976
Now let's see
if you can dip
like Fudgie Town employees.

05:55.976 --> 05:58.399
Working here
isn't as easy
as it seems.

05:59.740 --> 06:02.403
Really? 'Cause it seems
like you just do this.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.369
Did I miss anything?

06:10.951 --> 06:13.333
Wow, that was great!

06:13.333 --> 06:14.755
I'd hate to follow that.

06:14.755 --> 06:15.756
Shelby, you're up!

06:16.917 --> 06:17.918
No problem!

06:19.550 --> 06:21.592
Here we go,
I'll just, um...

06:24.635 --> 06:27.928
Get a strawberry
here and...

06:27.928 --> 06:31.472
(CHUCKLES) Whoops!
Slippery little sucker
got away from me there.

06:31.472 --> 06:32.773
Let me just,
uh, fish it out.

06:35.185 --> 06:37.067
Yeah, that's gone.
That's never
coming back.

06:40.861 --> 06:41.942
Got it!

06:41.942 --> 06:43.283
Cyd, that was amazing!

06:43.283 --> 06:44.284
How did you know
where to look?

06:44.284 --> 06:46.447
I don't know, it's like
the fudge told me.

06:46.447 --> 06:49.289
Holy cacao,
she's a fudge whisperer.

06:51.582 --> 06:53.584
Well, I've got a lot
to offer, too.

06:53.584 --> 06:55.035
There must be
something I can do.

06:55.035 --> 06:56.086
I have
the perfect thing.

06:59.249 --> 07:00.961
A mop?

07:00.961 --> 07:04.465
It'd be a real shame
to pull an artist like Cyd
off of dipping duty.

07:04.465 --> 07:08.098
Did she just make
a solar system in fudge?

07:08.098 --> 07:09.930
So we've got Mercury,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.261
Venus, the Moon,

07:11.261 --> 07:12.312
Neptupiter,

07:12.312 --> 07:13.433
and Australia.

07:17.768 --> 07:20.981
She didn't even know
Neptupiter was a planet
until I told her.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.330
You know, I know
I wasn't the one
who originally

07:30.330 --> 07:33.163
wanted this job,
but I'm having a blast.

07:33.163 --> 07:35.165
(SIGHING)
I've gotta admit,
this is not how

07:35.165 --> 07:37.167
I saw things going
when we took this job.

07:37.167 --> 07:40.961
I know, right!
This doesn't even feel
like work at all!

07:40.961 --> 07:43.293
Ooh, we're out of kale.

07:43.293 --> 07:45.175
Which doesn't sound
like a problem,

07:45.175 --> 07:46.757
but for some reason
people love it.

07:50.350 --> 07:52.593
Can I help you?
 Do you work here?

07:52.593 --> 07:55.015
Yes, in a very
important capacity.

07:58.438 --> 07:59.810
So what can I get you?

07:59.810 --> 08:01.982
How about a marshmallow?
You can't go wrong
with a classic.

08:07.277 --> 08:09.369
Have you been working
at Fudgie Town long?

08:09.369 --> 08:11.071
Why, does it look
like I know
what I'm doing?

08:14.535 --> 08:16.246
Not really.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.540
So, do I have to make up
a reason why I'm leaving
or can I just go?

08:20.380 --> 08:21.582
You can just go.

08:27.297 --> 08:29.009
(TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)

08:29.009 --> 08:32.222
Wait a minute,
Steve and Beau
are also identical twins?

08:32.222 --> 08:33.764
How many sets
of multiples are there

08:33.764 --> 08:36.135
in the tiny New England
hamlet of Kipp's Harbor?

08:36.135 --> 08:37.768
Someone should
be studying this.

08:40.601 --> 08:43.904
Barry, are you
watching soap operas
and eating nachos?

08:43.904 --> 08:45.065
Why not, Renaldo?

08:45.065 --> 08:46.567
I already
failed poetry.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.408
What's the use
in trying anymore?

08:48.408 --> 08:51.491
This is just the
inevitable next step
in my decline to mediocrity.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.415
I have good news.
 (GRUNTING)

08:57.497 --> 08:58.659
I talked
to your teacher.

08:58.659 --> 09:00.621
You talked
to Miss Wentworth?

09:00.621 --> 09:02.663
On the one hand,
that feels like
an invasion of my privacy.

09:02.663 --> 09:05.005
But on the other hand,
now that I'm
an uninformed member

09:05.005 --> 09:06.256
of the brainwashed masses,

09:06.256 --> 09:08.929
I must accept that
sacrificing my privacy

09:08.929 --> 09:11.802
is just the price I pay
for the vigilance
that keeps me safe.

09:12.883 --> 09:15.135
So what'd you find out?

09:15.135 --> 09:17.437
She said it's not too late
to save your grade.

09:17.437 --> 09:19.810
There's a poetry reading
at the school
this afternoon.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.683
If you go down there
and read one of your
poems, you won't fail.

09:22.683 --> 09:24.985
(SIGHING) But it has
to be a good poem.

09:24.985 --> 09:27.107
And you've read
all of mine,
they're terrible.

09:27.107 --> 09:29.950
I'm just not
sappy enough
to write this junk.

09:29.950 --> 09:31.782
Don't worry, Barry,

09:31.782 --> 09:33.784
there's a great poem
inside of you
and we'll find it.

09:33.784 --> 09:35.616
What do you
know about poetry?

09:35.616 --> 09:37.117
Not much.

09:37.117 --> 09:39.700
But that doesn't stop me
from getting published
in literary journals.

09:43.463 --> 09:44.875
Renaldo, is that you?

09:44.875 --> 09:47.668
Sure is.
The goatee's fake.

09:47.668 --> 09:49.880
And a comment
on the unattainable
expectations

09:49.880 --> 09:51.882
of masculinity
in a post-feminist
world.

09:57.978 --> 09:59.720
Hey, Shelby,
what are you doing?

09:59.720 --> 10:01.141
Nothing, just, uh,

10:01.141 --> 10:02.352
working for the man.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.523
I mean you.
'Cause...

10:03.523 --> 10:04.604
You the man!

10:06.186 --> 10:07.317
I am sorry I asked.

10:08.819 --> 10:10.490
Listen, Jordan,
I was wondering

10:10.490 --> 10:12.653
if maybe you could
take me off of mop duty.

10:12.653 --> 10:15.325
I'm really more of
a big idea person.

10:15.325 --> 10:18.448
Hey, Jordan, what
do you do when
the cash register is full?

10:18.448 --> 10:20.500
Full of what?

10:20.500 --> 10:22.663
Mostly fives and ones,
but there's a couple
of twenties in here.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.335
Whoa, that's
a lot of cash!

10:25.335 --> 10:29.129
I'm gonna go
count this where
the ladies can see.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.130
Be right back.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.712
Cyd, you're in charge.

10:33.213 --> 10:34.675
Cyd's in charge?

10:34.675 --> 10:35.926
I'm in charge?

10:36.516 --> 10:37.928
I'm in charge?

10:37.928 --> 10:39.599

pretty overwhelming for you,

I'm here to help.

10:46.727 --> 10:49.569
How about I run
the register or organize
the display case

10:49.569 --> 10:51.611

a little more basic,

a vertically integrated

if you could
take out the trash.

flipped the script
on us, didn't it?

in charge, asking me
to take out the trash.

11:08.378 --> 11:09.710
Never thought
that would happen.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.842
Wait. Why wouldn't
that happen?

Well, you know, 'cause
you're you and I'm me...

asking you
to take out the trash.

11:21.351 --> 11:22.562

Yes. I can
handle that.

Oh, no!

11:39.780 --> 11:42.202
Okay, Barry,
to write poetry,

11:42.202 --> 11:44.534
you have to be in touch
with your emotions.

11:44.534 --> 11:45.996
How do you feel?

11:45.996 --> 11:48.128
Hmm, right now
I'm feeling...

11:48.128 --> 11:49.209
Warm.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.752
Warm is not an emotion.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.003
Is itchy an emotion?

11:53.003 --> 11:54.424
Nope!

11:54.424 --> 11:56.386
I have no idea how
the human body works,

11:56.386 --> 11:58.338
but I think the tube
connecting your brain

11:58.338 --> 12:00.720
to your feelings-maker
is clogged.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.722
All we gotta do is clear
that clog by blasting

12:02.722 --> 12:05.605
a high-pressure stream
of emotion through
your feelings pipe.

12:05.605 --> 12:07.267
Renaldo, you're right.

12:07.267 --> 12:09.309
You have no idea how
the human body works.

feeling it, Barry?

tipped off that
the police are here,

20:33.813 --> 20:35.775
A strong, empowered
lady cop gave me this.

20:35.775 --> 20:37.487
She bosses
dudes around.
It's awesome.

20:38.818 --> 20:40.700
Shelby, you're
talking crazy.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.782
I'm serious!
The cops can hear
everything through this.

20:45.865 --> 20:47.327
Well, not anymore.

20:47.327 --> 20:48.578
Now it's all
covered in fudge.

20:50.460 --> 20:51.751
I'll get it.

20:53.503 --> 20:54.794
Forget it, I'm
using my hands.

20:56.876 --> 20:58.007
Almost got it.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.258
Shelby!

20:59.258 --> 21:02.472
Hands are one thing we
do not dip in the fudge!

21:02.472 --> 21:03.803
Unless...

21:03.803 --> 21:04.974
Cyd, what do you think?

21:06.726 --> 21:08.518
Got it!
Admit it, Jordan!

21:08.518 --> 21:11.020
You robbed those malls
and you were planning on
doing the same thing here!

21:11.020 --> 21:12.772
Rob the mall.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.654
I would
never do that.

21:19.158 --> 21:20.820
What is that stuff?

21:20.820 --> 21:22.322
Those are
the things
he stole!

21:22.322 --> 21:23.953
Zoe, get out here!

21:23.953 --> 21:26.165
Well, it's been
real nice working
with you two.

21:26.165 --> 21:27.327
Especially you, Cyd.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.408
Shelby, less so.

21:29.078 --> 21:30.410
Hey, wait.

21:30.410 --> 21:31.501
ZOE: What's happening?

21:31.501 --> 21:33.122
All we were
picking up
was static.

21:34.213 --> 21:35.505
That would
explain it.

21:36.836 --> 21:38.338
I'm sorry.
Jordan got away.

21:40.179 --> 21:42.802
But he doesn't have to.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.425
What do you say?
You wanna
work together?

21:45.425 --> 21:46.596
Only if you
take the lead.

21:49.429 --> 21:52.482
There she is!
My partner in crime!

21:52.482 --> 21:54.273
No, I'm not.

21:54.273 --> 21:56.315
This is Cyd Ripley
confirming I am not
his partner in crime.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.858
Zoe, you may
want to get out here.

22:00.149 --> 22:02.281
Why are you two
acting so weird?

22:02.281 --> 22:04.283
Hold it right there!

22:04.283 --> 22:07.787
I think this is what
you're looking for.

22:07.787 --> 22:10.039
I don't know
where all those
things came from.

22:10.039 --> 22:11.711
Tell it to the fudge!

22:14.003 --> 22:15.955
I specifically said
not to say that.

22:18.548 --> 22:20.169
She doesn't
always listen.

22:20.169 --> 22:21.721
But I love her.
(CHUCKLES)

22:29.348 --> 22:31.060
Tell it to the fudge!

22:31.060 --> 22:32.602
That's so good!

22:32.602 --> 22:33.973
What did that
Jordan guy think,
did he laugh?

22:33.973 --> 22:35.685
No, Naldo,
he did not laugh.

22:35.685 --> 22:37.106
Because he was
being arrested.

22:39.238 --> 22:41.901
I still can't
believe our first job
was for a criminal.

22:41.901 --> 22:44.153
I still can't believe
how good I was at working.

22:44.153 --> 22:45.695
I can.
Next job we get,

22:45.695 --> 22:47.407
I'll be happy
to take orders from you.

22:47.407 --> 22:48.748
Whoa,
what do you mean,
"next job"?

22:48.748 --> 22:49.869
I just worked
a full day.

22:49.869 --> 22:50.950
I need at least
a year off.

22:52.452 --> 22:53.993
Shh! Would you guys
keep it down?

22:53.993 --> 22:55.415
I'm trying to watc
 Kipp's Harbor.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.418
Steve is about to tell Kyle
that they're the same person.

23:00.550 --> 23:01.801
Is that Steve?
 Shh!

23:01.801 --> 23:03.092
Why does that dog
have an eyepatch?

23:03.092 --> 23:04.263
Shh!

23:04.263 --> 23:05.925
Does Alexander know
he married a ghost?

23:07.557 --> 23:10.269
I can't do this!
You guys are infuriating!

23:10.269 --> 23:12.772
Oh, I am so angry
I could write a poem!
