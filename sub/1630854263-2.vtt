00:10.401 --> 00:11.924
Yeah, it happens.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.404
You know, usually,
when I bring my car in,

00:13.448 --> 00:14.797
I have to leave it
out on the street.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.407
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

00:16.451 --> 00:17.800

so busy.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.976
Yup.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.981
No, not today.

00:26.461 --> 00:27.592

about it?

00:27.636 --> 00:29.594
I do not.

00:31.596 --> 00:32.945

00:32.989 --> 00:35.861

I can't do that.

00:35.905 --> 00:38.647
All right, look, fine.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.823
Business isn't what
it used to be.

00:40.866 --> 00:44.044
And it's not just the
competition from the big chains,

00:44.087 --> 00:45.480
it's all these new cars.

00:45.523 --> 00:48.004
They don't have driveshafts
and differentials,

00:48.048 --> 00:50.920
it's just motherboards
and chips.

00:50.963 --> 00:53.357
It's like riding around
in a big-ass iPad.

00:55.664 --> 00:56.926
Well...

00:56.969 --> 00:58.884
would you like some
constructive criticism?

00:58.928 --> 01:01.539
Oh... Lord.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.498
Look, this place
is a little old-school.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.500
I mean, you don't
even have free Wi-Fi.

01:05.543 --> 01:06.979
Yes, I do.

01:07.023 --> 01:08.981
It's from the Thai place
next door.

01:10.505 --> 01:12.637
The password
is "padthai22."

01:12.681 --> 01:14.813
They tried to change it,
but I figured it out.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.380
[laughs]

01:16.424 --> 01:17.729
Okay.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.470
Have you ever noticed
one of those businesses

01:19.514 --> 01:21.733
that has a sticker
in the window that reads,

01:21.777 --> 01:23.344
"People love us
on Yelp"?

01:24.562 --> 01:26.347
Yeah, but why would I care
about some sticker?

01:26.390 --> 01:28.827
Well, because your customers
care about them.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.481
I use the site
all the time.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.483
In fact, I have
Elite reviewer status,

01:32.527 --> 01:33.484

01:33.528 --> 01:35.095
Don't worry,
you didn't.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.662
Okay, think about this,

01:37.706 --> 01:39.403

ever read a book

01:39.447 --> 01:40.752
that didn't have
an Oprah sticker on it?

01:40.796 --> 01:43.059
[chuckling] Hell no.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.714

You know, since the day
you met Necie,

09:56.639 --> 09:57.597
♪ Ah...
Yes!

09:57.640 --> 10:00.991
That's your
sweet spot, Kermit.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.297
[laughter]

10:02.340 --> 10:04.516
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't laugh.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.692
Some of y'all
sound like

10:05.735 --> 10:07.389
you got your fingers
slammed in a car door.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.263
Let's go. Again.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.180
This is gonna take a week?

10:16.224 --> 10:17.399
Well, it wouldn't
take a week

10:17.442 --> 10:19.880
if you ever
changed your oil.

10:19.923 --> 10:22.186
Man, you sound like
my father.

10:22.230 --> 10:25.015
Well, I am not your father
because, if I was,

10:25.059 --> 10:28.192
I'd take your car
and give you a bike.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.977
Now take that
to your real daddy.

10:33.589 --> 10:37.201
So, Calvin, just curious,

10:37.245 --> 10:38.899
how do you think that guy's
feeling right now?

10:38.942 --> 10:42.293
[chuckling] Probably stupid
for not changing his oil.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.948
Okay, you know what,
uh, let me rephrase.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.255
What do you think that guy's
gonna say on Yelp?

10:47.298 --> 10:49.257
"Five stars"?

10:51.085 --> 10:52.956
"Guy reminds me of my father"?

10:54.349 --> 10:56.612
Come on, Dave, come on,
don't-don't get in my head

10:56.656 --> 10:58.092
about this.Well, I don't want to,

10:58.135 --> 11:00.268
but with Yelp comes
tremendous responsibility.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.444
I don't want
the responsibility,

11:02.487 --> 11:04.620
I just want the sticker.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.188
You have to earn the sticker.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.886
Now, it's not
that not hard.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.888
You just got to add
a little bit of sunshine.

11:11.932 --> 11:15.283
Now, I've taken the liberty of
making you a little cheat sheet.

11:15.326 --> 11:18.286
Here, "Number one,
ask them how they're doing,

11:18.329 --> 11:19.896
i.e. how their day is."

11:19.940 --> 11:23.117
Their day is terrible.
Their car's broken.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.596
Ugh.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.077
Calvin, come on,
just try it out.

11:27.121 --> 11:30.080
[sighs] All right,
I'll give it a shot,

11:30.124 --> 11:31.908
man.
Okay, look.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.083
[laughs] Yeah, all right.

11:33.127 --> 11:35.607
Hello. Welcome
to Calvin's Pit Stop.

11:35.651 --> 11:38.523
How are you today?
I'd really like to know.

11:46.227 --> 11:47.576
Hey.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.274
Hello, again. How are you?

11:50.318 --> 11:53.190
I need to dump some used
motor oil. Where do I put it?

11:53.234 --> 11:54.626
I'll tell you
where you can put it.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.498
You can put it...[coughs]

11:58.630 --> 12:02.286
Look, I'm sorry, but we only
do that for our customers.

12:02.330 --> 12:06.073
But the recycling center is just
a mile up Lincoln in Altadena.

12:06.116 --> 12:07.596
It's a lovely drive, by the way.

12:07.639 --> 12:08.989
All right, fine.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.338
[Calvin chuckles]

12:10.381 --> 12:13.558
Be sure to love us on Yelp.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.038
Man...

12:15.082 --> 12:16.213
You see that...

12:16.257 --> 12:17.562
Calvin, that showed
amazing restraint.

12:17.606 --> 12:20.652
It sure did.
Did you hear him?Yeah.

12:20.696 --> 12:21.958
"I want
to recycle my oil."

12:22.002 --> 12:24.047
You know what?
I was about to recycle...

12:24.091 --> 12:26.310
Hey, hello.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.138
Welcome to Calvin's Pit Stop.

12:28.182 --> 12:31.141
How can I turn
your Monday a fun day?

12:31.185 --> 12:32.752
Nailed it.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.369
So, I wanted
to show you

12:41.412 --> 12:43.588
what I'm gonna do
with my class tomorrow.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.460
Nobody can teach the difference

12:45.503 --> 12:47.767
between major
and minor keys like

12:47.810 --> 12:50.334
Stevie Wonder. [laughs]

12:50.378 --> 12:51.683
Ooh. Whew.

12:51.727 --> 12:54.948
This is gonna blow
their little unformed minds.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.819
That's awesome.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.779
You're doing a great job.
It's just...

12:59.822 --> 13:01.781
these kids are
pretty sheltered,

13:01.824 --> 13:03.739
and I'm afraid
you're being a

13:03.783 --> 13:06.611
teensy bit... blunt.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.004
Yup. That's me.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.485
[laughs]Yeah.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.791
And that's great.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.923
It's just, maybe you're
a little too blunt.

13:13.967 --> 13:17.492
Just a teensy weensy bit.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.755
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.497
I'm being
"a teensy weensy bit...

13:22.540 --> 13:23.628
too blunt"?

13:23.672 --> 13:26.022
Just try to remember
they're children.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.982
Children with parents who aren't
shy about calling the principal.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.505
But, again,

13:30.548 --> 13:33.900
you're doing great,
so great.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.641
So great, but too blunt, huh?

13:36.685 --> 13:38.513
Just an eensy, teensy,
weensy bit. [chuckles]

13:38.556 --> 13:40.515
And pretty, so pretty.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.000
Whoo! Oh, man!

13:47.043 --> 13:48.871
Man, it's been
a long time.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.394
Last time
I was out like this,

13:50.438 --> 13:53.006
I was a desperate single guy,
striking out with hot women.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.008
[laughs]

13:55.051 --> 13:57.053
Well, it's a grind
out here, man.

13:57.097 --> 13:59.490
You know, you are lucky
you are not on the hunt anymore.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.536
Hey, what can I say, baby?
I'm a lucky man.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.364
[laughs]
[scoffs] Yeah, right.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.977
I am in your way. Forgive me.

14:08.021 --> 14:11.546
Oh, don't worry.
I'll find a way to squeeze in.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.032
What the hell was that?
What?

14:20.816 --> 14:22.078
She was hitting
on you, man.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.646
No, really?
Yes, really.

14:25.734 --> 14:26.953
Save my spot.

14:26.996 --> 14:29.738
At all costs.
[chuckles] Okay.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.393
This spot right here?
Okay, I got it.
Mm-hmm.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.438
[grunting, whooshing]

14:34.482 --> 14:37.746
You're dancing
with me.

14:37.789 --> 14:40.531
[chuckles]Who are you?

14:40.575 --> 14:42.664
I don't know.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.888
[grunts]
Uh-oh.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.065
Baby, why are you frowning?

14:52.108 --> 14:54.023
I can't help it, bae.

14:54.067 --> 14:57.548
I've been fake-smiling all day.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.899
It's like my face
been doing squats.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.859
But, apparently,
that's what you have to do

15:03.903 --> 15:06.079
if I want to get
one of these Yelp stickers.

15:07.123 --> 15:10.518
I mean, God forbid I look
at somebody the wrong way,

15:10.561 --> 15:12.433
and they write a bad review.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.392
Well, that's ridiculous,
Calvin.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.785
Your customers
have always loved you.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.134
I know.

15:18.178 --> 15:19.875
So what if
I'm prickly?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.660
I am who I am.
Exactly.

15:22.704 --> 15:23.966
You know,
like today,

15:24.010 --> 15:25.968
Gemma told me that
I was too blunt.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.535
What's wrong with blunt?

15:27.578 --> 15:28.840
Nothing.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.104
It's not my job
to lie to those kids.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.410
They need honesty
if they're gonna do better.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.978
You know what,
if we are guilty of anything,

15:36.022 --> 15:37.632
it's that
we care too much.

15:37.675 --> 15:38.894
Boom.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.809
[grunts]

15:40.852 --> 15:43.159
I actually like
your bluntness.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.814
Mm.
You are a strong,
blunt woman.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.163
Mm-hmm.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.731
And I like that
you're prickly, you know?

15:49.774 --> 15:51.515
That means
you don't take any crap.

15:51.559 --> 15:54.910
You mess with a porcupine,
your behind's gonna get pricked.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.825
[laughs]

15:56.868 --> 15:59.001
You see, that's why
we are a great couple.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.612
Mm. That's right,
that's right.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.919
Um, baby,
may I be blunt?

16:03.963 --> 16:06.748
I wish that you would.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.011
I want to take you
to the bedroom

16:09.055 --> 16:12.797
and do 17 nasty
things to you.

16:12.841 --> 16:13.973
Seventeen?

16:15.626 --> 16:18.847
Ooh, can we do nine
and get some rest?

16:20.675 --> 16:23.678
No? Well, how about I lay
there, and we can do 12?

16:32.643 --> 16:34.645
[Marty laughing]

16:37.083 --> 16:38.823
Valerie! Valerie.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.739
Valerie, I...
I'm an engaged man.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.872
A very, very flattered
engaged man.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.134
Okay. [laughing]

16:48.703 --> 16:50.487
I feel like a piece of meat,

16:50.531 --> 16:52.489
but I did get a free margatini.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.144
I figured it out.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.494
You know, it all
makes sense now.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.106
See, it used to be,
in situations like this, you...

17:00.149 --> 17:02.151
you always had an air
of desperation about you.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.849
Yeah, no argument there.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.156
But now that
you have a fiancée,

17:07.200 --> 17:08.940
it is totally
different.

17:08.984 --> 17:10.942
You see,
the desperation is gone.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.857
You're loose
and-and funny,

17:12.901 --> 17:14.903
and you are not even
trying at all.

17:14.946 --> 17:16.078
Why didn't I have
this superpower

17:16.122 --> 17:17.558
when I could've enjoyed it?

17:17.601 --> 17:19.647
That is the irony,
my brother.

17:19.690 --> 17:22.693
You only have it
because you don't need it.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.913
You know, this is fun,
man, but...

17:24.956 --> 17:27.176
I am over this dating scene.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.048
got to be honest,
lil' bro...

17:30.571 --> 17:32.660
...I envy what you have
with Necie.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.792
Aw, man.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.925
You know, if you want
to find the one,

17:36.968 --> 17:38.187
you got to meet her
somewhere, right?

17:38.231 --> 17:40.711
Yeah.
Let me

17:40.755 --> 17:42.148
use my powers for good.

17:42.191 --> 17:44.019
What do you mean?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.239
Excuse me, miss.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.589
Do you like Idris Elba?Yes, I do.

17:48.632 --> 17:51.722
Okay, well, what if Idris
was younger, more athletic,

17:51.766 --> 17:53.768
and had a job coaching baseball
at one of the most prestigious

17:53.811 --> 17:55.161
universities in
Southern California?

17:55.204 --> 17:56.684
Whoa, you do?

17:56.727 --> 17:57.902
No, girl. Look at me.

17:59.861 --> 18:02.342
No, I struck out at kickball,
and I'm engaged, but...

18:03.691 --> 18:06.215
...this is my brother,
and he is a catch.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.956
[clears throat]
Hey, I'm Malcolm.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.349
Six two.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.873
Hi, Malcolm. Uh, come sit
with me and my friends.

18:11.916 --> 18:14.571
Oh, I would love to.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.095
Can you do
a British accent?

18:16.138 --> 18:19.010
[British accent]:
I do believe I can.[laughs]

18:22.188 --> 18:24.146
Oh, hey, Calvin.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.888
So, you just wait out here?

18:26.931 --> 18:29.108
Sometimes I do, yes.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.242
What do you want?
Okay, well,

18:33.286 --> 18:35.592
despite my intentions,
which were

18:35.636 --> 18:37.594
very, very good...

18:37.638 --> 18:38.987
[sighs] I messed up.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.208
What the hell?

18:42.251 --> 18:45.254
So my rating went down
a half a star?

18:45.298 --> 18:48.127
I know. Scroll down.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.912
"The owner smiled
the whole time,

18:50.955 --> 18:52.174
it was creepy."

18:54.263 --> 18:56.265
Oh, and then
there's this one.

18:56.309 --> 18:59.050
"Expect a lot
of mindless chitchat."

18:59.094 --> 19:00.791
In my defense,

19:00.835 --> 19:03.794
I happen to love
mindless chitchat.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.014
You know, I should've
followed my instincts.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.799
It just didn't feel right
being so nice.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.673
I'm done, Dave.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.327
I'm bringing back
old Calvin,

19:14.370 --> 19:16.938
and if that doesn't give me
a sticker, then so be it.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.722
No, y-you are getting
that sticker

19:18.766 --> 19:20.942
because you're
a great mechanic.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.639
Look, you were getting
nothing but five stars

19:22.683 --> 19:23.945
until I started getting
in your head.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.120
You're damn right I was.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.122
Yes, you were, and you want
to know why?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.255
Because people
love Prickly Calvin.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.823
I love
Prickly Calvin.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.869
I know you do.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.740
Now get the hell out of my way.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.396
Hey, Calvin.

19:42.311 --> 19:43.965
Welcome back.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.061

Yes! I love it.

20:10.861 --> 20:14.300
That was almost beautiful.

20:14.343 --> 20:17.085
You little germ buckets
can sing.

20:17.128 --> 20:20.741
All right, give me some,
give me some, give me some.

20:20.784 --> 20:24.397
Okay, okay, now,
run me my props.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.268
I think that's what
I'm about to do.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.924
Tina, I'm blown away.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.100
Oh, of course you are.
And by the way?

20:32.143 --> 20:33.928
Five more kids
showed up this week,

20:33.971 --> 20:35.756
and two of them
can actually sing.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.453
[both laugh]

20:37.497 --> 20:39.368
That's great.
Uh-huh.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.022
Look, Gemma, I, um,

20:41.065 --> 20:42.937
I know you're in
a tough position,

20:42.980 --> 20:44.765
but... I got to be me.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.506
And I want you to be.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.290
If I'm gonna be good at my job,

20:48.334 --> 20:49.944
I've got to hire
the best people....
Mm.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.380
...and you are the best.
Mm.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.252
You can be as blunt
as you want to be.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.123
Good. [chuckles]
'Cause those pants

20:55.166 --> 20:56.472
aren't doing your butt
any favors.
