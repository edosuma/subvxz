00:01.669 --> 00:03.604
Harper:
<i>Previously on</i> Secrets
of Sulphur Springs...

00:04.672 --> 00:06.907
Who are you guys?
I'd know it
if you were campers.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.543
Uh, I'm Harry
and this is...

00:09.677 --> 00:11.079
Um, Hermione.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.680
Griffin:
<i>My dad said</i>
<i>he didn't know Savannah.</i>

00:13.247 --> 00:14.215
He lied to me.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.184
It's every place
we felt a cold spot.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.186
In the kitchen,
in the dining room.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.888
There's a room
behind this wall.

00:21.021 --> 00:21.889
A secret room?

00:22.390 --> 00:23.657
Ben:
<i>Probably boarded-up</i>
<i>years ago.</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:25.393
(girl singing on recorder)

00:25.526 --> 00:29.330
<i>* Under sugar maple shade *</i>

00:29.597 --> 00:30.531
-(Ben exclaims)
-(music stops)

00:31.665 --> 00:33.601
Griffin:
<i>Dad's been lying.</i>
<i>He knew Savannah.</i>

00:34.168 --> 00:35.669
You got all this from Harper,
didn't you?

00:35.803 --> 00:37.638
You and Harper
need to take a break.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.307
Is that where you were today?
The Tremont?

00:39.440 --> 00:40.408
Did you used to go
to camp there?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.009
(scoffs)
Of course not.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.512
You're wasting your time
on that freaky Savannah.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.514
You must be new.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.548
I'm Jessica,

00:48.116 --> 00:49.717
but everyone calls me Jess.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.453
Harper:
<i>My mother flat-out said</i>
<i>she never went to camp.</i>

00:52.586 --> 00:54.522
<i>She's covering something up.</i>
<i>Just like your dad.</i>

00:54.655 --> 00:55.889
(door creaking)

00:56.023 --> 00:57.391
Griffin:
<i>How are we gonna</i>
<i>save Savannah?</i>

01:00.428 --> 01:01.862
(door creaking)

01:01.995 --> 01:03.331
Harper:
She's here.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.137
Maybe we should
just throw it out?

01:09.270 --> 01:10.471
No, no.
I can save it.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.605
I just need...

01:13.073 --> 01:14.875
Griffin. Perfect guy
for the job.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.010
We'll put this thing
right in no time.
Won't we, bud?

01:17.145 --> 01:19.847
All right.
I'll let you two guys
get to it.

01:20.814 --> 01:21.949
(phone chimes)

01:24.952 --> 01:26.520
Actually, now's not
a really good time.

01:26.654 --> 01:29.089
Come on, Griff.
Let's show your mom
we can do this on our own.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.191
It'll only take a minute.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.126
What do you need?

01:32.626 --> 01:34.728
Hold this straight
while I secure the base.

01:41.735 --> 01:42.836
Looks good, huh?

01:42.970 --> 01:44.538
Uh, yeah, sure.
Can I go?

01:45.005 --> 01:46.039
Yeah, yeah.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.576
(vehicle approaching)

01:56.350 --> 01:57.218
Grandpa!

01:57.851 --> 01:59.520
(chuckles)
Griffin.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.590
What are you
doing here, Dad?

02:03.391 --> 02:04.525
Better question, son.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.160
What are you doing here?

02:08.196 --> 02:10.898
Hey, go grab my bags
out of the car,
would you, Griffin?

02:11.031 --> 02:12.533
I-- I would,
but I got to go.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.268
Griffin,
help your grandfather,

02:15.469 --> 02:17.571
though I can't imagine
he'll be staying long.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.209
I'll stay as long as it takes
to talk some sense into you.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.412
You shouldn't be here,
Bennett.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.815
None of you should.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.927
(theme music playing)

02:56.844 --> 02:58.546
(objects clattering)

03:00.147 --> 03:01.515
Wyatt:
It's not in here.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.751
It has to be.
Look harder.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.919
(clattering continues)

03:07.921 --> 03:09.623
(door creaking)

03:09.757 --> 03:11.825
-Wyatt.
-I'm looking!

03:11.959 --> 03:14.295
(whooshing)

03:17.097 --> 03:18.632
-Got it.
-(floorboard creaking)

03:21.935 --> 03:23.271
(all scream)

03:24.438 --> 03:25.706
You guys scared me.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.308
We scared you?

03:27.975 --> 03:29.443
Zoey:
Uh, what are
you doing here?

03:29.577 --> 03:30.978
I thought you couldn't
come over anymore.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.514
I snuck in to hang out
with Griffin.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.584
What are
you doing down here?

03:37.485 --> 03:39.687
No one else believes us
about Savannah's ghost.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.722
So we're gonna catch her
on camera.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.358
Just got to figure out
how it works.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.060
Think it needs
a little cassette in there.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.096
My brother's a geek
for that kind of stuff.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.731
He can explain it better.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.199
You should go find him.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.836
You guys aren't supposed
to be down here.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.037
Neither are you.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.472
We won't tell Mom and Dad
if you don't.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.809
Okay fine.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.248
-(footsteps receding)
-(door closes)

04:08.382 --> 04:09.683
You don't think
they found the bunker?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.785
No, but it'll ruin everything
if they did.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.654
We have
to be more careful.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.656
-Are you ready?
-Definitely.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.959
We have to go back
and find out exactly what
our parents are hiding.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.394
And fast.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.029
When we felt Savannah's ghost
in your room last night,

04:22.663 --> 04:25.032
I think it was her way
of urging us on, you know?

04:25.165 --> 04:27.134
-Like she
wanted us to hurry.
-I know what you mean.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.437
We don't have
much time though.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.004
My grandpa just
randomly showed up,

04:31.138 --> 04:32.906
and now we have to have
family dinner tonight.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.107
You can't get out of it?

04:34.241 --> 04:36.310
No way.
With my grandpa
being here,

04:36.444 --> 04:38.245
my dad is acting
even weirder than usual.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.549
I just don't get it.
As a kid, he was so chill.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.018
What happened to him?

04:49.457 --> 04:50.491
Why do you have
to be so bratty?

04:50.624 --> 04:51.959
How can you be
so selfish?

04:52.092 --> 04:54.495
Savannah:
I'm not being selfish.
I'm having fun.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.729
You should try it sometime.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.764
Jess:
Well, sorry if
my idea of fun

04:56.897 --> 04:58.165
doesn't involve
stealing punch

04:58.298 --> 04:59.733
and throwing it
around springs.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.669
I mean, what if
you attracted
grizzly bears here?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.003
Grizzlies?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.538
In Louisiana?

05:04.672 --> 05:06.073
Whatever!

05:06.206 --> 05:07.541
You're going to keep
getting in trouble,

05:07.675 --> 05:09.042
and you're going
to get Ben kicked out.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.645
Ben can do what he wants,
and so can I.

05:12.179 --> 05:14.948
Just because you act like
you're in charge
of everyone here, Jess,

05:15.082 --> 05:16.884
it doesn't mean
you actually are.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.658
Whoa, was that your mom?

05:25.192 --> 05:27.260
Yeah.
She's a lot different now.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.029
Griffin:
I'll go find my dad.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.698
See if I can get him
talking about Savannah.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.200
And I'll ask Jess.
I mean... my mom.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.437
(exhales)
Man, this is so strange.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.505
Tell me about it.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.672
Do you think
she'll talk to you?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.674
Don't worry.
I have a strategy.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.410
Yeah.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.412
Remember,
keep it subtle.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.746
Way ahead of you.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.785
(playing rock guitar riff)

06:01.562 --> 06:02.763
Harry, what's up?

06:03.330 --> 06:04.898
Get kicked out
of the hotel yet?

06:05.833 --> 06:06.667
Not yet.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.770
Why? You and Savannah
need help on your next prank?

06:10.303 --> 06:11.772
As soon as we plan one,
we'll let you know.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.107
What about
the camp dance?

06:14.241 --> 06:15.809
You're probably
going together, right?

06:16.309 --> 06:17.210
Nah.

06:18.446 --> 06:19.947
Sorry. I thought
you liked her.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.249
I mean, sure I like her.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.017
Savannah's different,
you know?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.186
Of course,
not everyone appreciates that.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.394
Hey, you doing okay, Jess?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.764
Do I not look okay?

06:37.364 --> 06:39.667
Oh, no. You do.
I just-- I, uh--

06:39.800 --> 06:41.735
I saw you and Savannah
fighting outside.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.203
It was hardly a fight.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.306
It was Savannah being
her usual obnoxious self.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.477
Yeah, she was
pretty awful to you.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.913
I know, right?
She thinks she's so cool but

06:53.781 --> 06:54.882
it's so fake.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.984
I can't believe
Ben doesn't see it.

06:57.818 --> 06:58.752
Are you, um...

06:59.487 --> 07:01.254
Are you jealous
of her and Ben?

07:01.388 --> 07:03.924
Jealous?
Of Little Orphan Annie?
Please.

07:04.725 --> 07:08.128
I just think
this place would be
a whole lot nicer

07:08.261 --> 07:09.329
if she'd just...

07:10.498 --> 07:12.766
like... go away.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.640
(continues guitar riff)

07:20.340 --> 07:21.274
What song is that?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.544
Uh, just something
I've been working on.

07:24.077 --> 07:24.945
You wrote that?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.014
Uh, yeah.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.317
I'm supposed to be practicing
for the talent show tomorrow.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.285
My dad's coming,
and he wants me to play

07:32.419 --> 07:35.122
something boring
and "classical."

07:35.255 --> 07:36.256
I don't know.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.326
(sighs)
I'd rather play
my own thing, you know?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.894
Then you totally should.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.796
That song you were playing
was awesome.

07:42.930 --> 07:43.731
Really?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.332
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

07:46.399 --> 07:49.102
Uh, well, of course,
I actually need
to finish it first.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.071
Uh, want to help?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.174
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.079
(playing riff)

07:59.212 --> 08:01.448
My mom was
definitely jealous
of Savannah.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.450
Did you get
anything out of Ben?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.485
Um, not a lot.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.055
He showed me a song
he was working on, though.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.290
I got to help with it.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.259
Like actually helped
write it.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.728
It was so cool finally getting
to play guitar with my dad.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.297
Griffin! We're not here
to make friends
with our parents.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.766
We're supposed
to save Savannah.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.067
Yeah, I know that.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.769
But Ben doesn't really seem
to be hiding anything.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.871
We know he is.
Why else would your dad
be lying to us back at home?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.405
Your mom lied too.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.207
Which is why
I'm taking it seriously
when I question her

08:27.340 --> 08:29.242
and not just giggling
over music together.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.978
Ben and I didn't giggle.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.313
You're just mad
that my dad, as a kid, is fun

08:33.446 --> 08:35.148
and your mom,
as a kid, is...

08:35.649 --> 08:36.784
kind of the worst.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.953
We better get back.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.755
Wouldn't want you
to miss dinner
with your fun dad.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.626
(sighs)

08:47.628 --> 08:49.262
Sarah:
I would have
fixed up the guest room

08:49.396 --> 08:51.164
had I known
you were coming, Bennett.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.266
-I hope it's okay.
-Oh, I'll make do.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.868
Griffin,
we've been waiting for you.

08:55.002 --> 08:55.969
Where have you been?

08:57.470 --> 08:58.572
Just, uh...

08:59.873 --> 09:00.974
Just doing homework.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.142
All afternoon?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.476
Good man, Griffin.

09:03.611 --> 09:06.213
Study hard, rise to the top,
and do important things.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.514
It's the Campbell way.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.449
At least it was
until recently.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.686
I am doing something
important here, Dad.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.655
Don't you remember
what this place
used to be like?

09:14.788 --> 09:16.123
All too well.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.991
I'm worried that you're the one
with the faulty memory, Bennett.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.761
You know, it's not too late
for you to go back to Chicago.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.296
I can always get you
reinstated at the firm.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.865
-You were doing so well.
-Ben: Dad.

09:25.465 --> 09:26.299
Enough.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.472
Kids, what are you
hiding under there?

09:34.908 --> 09:35.976
We found it.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.979
Hey, Grandpa,
you're really old.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.381
Do you know how
to find something
called a cassette?

09:41.514 --> 09:42.750
Wyatt!

09:42.883 --> 09:44.484
-I am so sorry.
-It's okay.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.988
So what are you hoping
to record with that thing?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.257
-A ghost.
-Ah.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.325
Savannah's ghost.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.262
Savannah?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.331
How many times
do I have to tell you

09:58.465 --> 10:01.068
we're done talking
about ghosts?

10:18.185 --> 10:19.619
You didn't say much
at dinner.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.960
-What's going on?
-It's just...

10:28.528 --> 10:30.664
Why are boys
so frustrating?

10:31.498 --> 10:33.934
You talking about
any frustrating boy
in particular?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.637
I hope it's not one
who lives in a certain hotel

10:37.771 --> 10:40.107
that I most definitely
asked you to stay away from.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.776
No, it's not Griffin.
Just...

10:43.410 --> 10:44.845
boys in general...

10:44.978 --> 10:46.446
can be so...

10:46.579 --> 10:47.547
immature.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.082
(chuckles)

10:49.216 --> 10:51.351
Yeah, I remember
what that's like.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.154
Come here.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.428
Boys can make
you feel like you're crazy,

11:02.195 --> 11:03.563
especially when
you have a crush.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.701
Did your first crush
make you crazy?

11:08.401 --> 11:10.871
If you count filling up
two notebooks
of Mariah Carey lyrics...

11:11.004 --> 11:12.339
-(Harper chuckles)
-...then yes.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.408
Um... How did it end?

11:15.743 --> 11:17.344
Was it bad?

11:19.579 --> 11:21.381
It ended the way
all crushes do,

11:22.850 --> 11:24.284

getting crushed.

can I ask you something?

11:48.141 --> 11:49.376
Yeah, sure.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.612
Why are you so mad
at Dad for coming back
to Sulphur Springs?

11:52.746 --> 11:54.114
Well...

11:55.248 --> 11:57.684
I've always wanted
what was best for your father,

11:58.518 --> 12:00.253
and sometimes we disagree
on what that is.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.890
You think this place
is bad for my dad?

12:03.023 --> 12:04.257
How come?

12:04.758 --> 12:05.793
Well, look at it.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.962
It's nothing but
a pile of old wood

12:09.096 --> 12:10.931

a backwater swamp.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.366
No place for a Campbell
to end up.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.637
Bad memories?
What kind of bad memories?

12:17.938 --> 12:19.873
The past
belongs in the past.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.741

Look, I know that
you asked Harper
to stay away from Griffin.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.105
It's nothing personal.
Just protecting my daughter.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.673
I completely understand.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.442
It seems those two
are a bad influence
on each other.

I think it makes sense
to keep them apart,
at least for now.

Hmm. Might me easier to do

we're on the same page.

Uh, look, I think
we can both agree

kind of a bust.
-Yeah.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.970

it's better when
we work together.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.106
-As a team.
-Exactly!

And we definitely
still have work to do

14:01.474 --> 14:03.543
if we really wanna find out
what our parents are hiding.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.346
I wish we could
go back now.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.847
How are we gonna
sit around all day,

14:07.981 --> 14:10.483
learning about mitochondria
and eating bologna sandwiches

-when Savannah's life
is on the line?

to listen to you
play that... garbage?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.252
Clearly, sending you

was a mistake.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.054
You embarrassed me today,
Bennett.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.156
You embarrassed yourself.

<i>Next time on</i> Secrets
of Sulphur Springs...

23:25.171 --> 23:27.373
Tonight's the anniversary
of Savannah's disappearance.

23:27.507 --> 23:30.109
she'll be haunting this place
extra hard.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.678
The camp dance starts at 8:00.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.480
That gives us
less than five hours
to save her from...

23:33.613 --> 23:35.214
Just say it, my mom.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.550
-Going somewhere?
-I do have someplace to be.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.519
-But you have to
really cover for me, okay?
-Done.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.523
Jess: <i>Hey, Hermione,</i>
<i>do you wanna come</i>
<i>to the dance with me tonight?</i>

23:43.656 --> 23:46.292
I can always use
a partner in... crime.
