20:50.332 --> 20:52.417
<i>that you started the rumor</i>
<i>and that it's a lie.</i>

20:52.501 --> 20:53.669
- Leave me alone, Brooks.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.921
- Girls?

21:04.930 --> 21:07.015
- Hey, why's my curtain
moving?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.558
- If you don't admit
what you did,

21:08.642 --> 21:09.351
bye-bye curtain.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.229
- You wouldn't dare.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.689
- Yeah, we would.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.399
- What will happen?

21:15.482 --> 21:16.525

[together]
Nine...

It was me!

21:28.412 --> 21:29.830
[all gasping]

21:29.913 --> 21:32.082
Zoey and James

All right?
Everybody happy?

21:34.793 --> 21:35.877
Good. Get out.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.047
[all cheering]

21:39.131 --> 21:41.383

22:06.908 --> 22:08.493
- Oh, the best.
I love thin crust.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.621
- Me too.
What's wrong with Chicago?

22:11.705 --> 22:14.458
- Yeah, don't get me started
on the whole deep dish thing.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.000
It's just wrong.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.794
- I know, right?

22:17.878 --> 22:19.671
- Anyway, I'm glad we squashed

22:19.755 --> 22:21.214
that whole rumor thing.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.883
- Logan's just ridiculous
sometimes.

22:22.966 --> 22:23.759
- Yeah, no doubt.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.553
Hey, I hear
