<i>Previously on</i>SWAT...TAN: Hey, you remember

00:04.860 --> 00:05.970
Miguel Alfaro, Long Beach SWAT.
Was just filling me in

00:06.170 --> 00:07.320
on some of your
LBPD war stories.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.190
Only the good ones, Streeter.
Promise.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.580
I've known Alfaro
since I was 19.

00:10.780 --> 00:11.840
We were in the Academy
together in Long Beach.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.670
<i>I just don't trust him.</i>

00:13.870 --> 00:15.280
NICHELLE:
<i>A couple members on the panel</i>

00:15.480 --> 00:16.720
still see me
as a cop's girlfriend.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.110
I'm afraid they'll
think I'm biased

00:18.310 --> 00:20.200
if I rule
in the officer's favor.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.810
HONDO:
<i>Powell ignored orders,</i>
<i>didn't she?</i>

00:22.010 --> 00:22.900
Look, Powell is stubborn,
but I really do think

00:23.100 --> 00:24.590
that she's worth investing in.

00:24.790 --> 00:25.940
HONDO:
<i>You get Powell squared away.</i>

00:26.140 --> 00:27.290
She's your responsibility now.

00:27.490 --> 00:28.730
This is my wife Bonnie.

00:28.930 --> 00:30.770
Nice to finally meet you.

00:30.970 --> 00:31.950
Last night, I was
at Del Fresco's for dinner.

00:32.150 --> 00:33.120
I saw Bonnie.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.430
She was there with a guy.

00:34.630 --> 00:36.000
We just figured
you'd want to know.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.130
That you think
my wife is cheating on me.

00:37.330 --> 00:38.560
If you don't believe me,
ask her.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.650

01:16.630 --> 01:18.080
Mind watching it?

01:18.280 --> 01:20.000
You're at a bar, man.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, well, some of us
just want to drink in peace.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.520
Then go home.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.260
[sighs]
Can't do that.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.950
You got dumped, huh?

01:29.130 --> 01:31.180
Why don't you back off, man?

01:31.380 --> 01:33.970
I can see why she left you.

01:34.170 --> 01:36.050
Here's hoping
she found someone better.

01:36.570 --> 01:38.090
Hey.

01:38.830 --> 01:41.100
BARTENDER:
Hey, knock it off!

01:42.750 --> 01:46.010

Not this thing again.

swaddling is very important,

02:14.900 --> 02:16.710
Hmm. Wait. What?

02:16.910 --> 02:19.360
What's wrong?Tan spent the night
in the drunk tank.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.840
Wouldn't let anybody
call me till this morning.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.360
He's probably
embarrassed.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.150
Apparently, he got
in a fight in some bar.

02:26.350 --> 02:28.150
Baby, I'm sorry. I got
to bail on breakfast.

02:28.350 --> 02:30.410
I know Hicks is gonna want
to deal with Tan first thing.

02:32.190 --> 02:34.680

02:34.880 --> 02:38.080
Hondo, wait.

02:38.270 --> 02:40.120
I just got a text
about Tan, too.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.510
From the inspector general.I.G.? No, no.

02:42.710 --> 02:45.000
My guy from the Sixth Division
said there was no arrest,

02:45.190 --> 02:47.000
didn't seem like anyone was
going to press charges.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.480
That normally means that
SWAT handles issues internally.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.740
All I know is she's
calling for a meeting

02:50.940 --> 02:52.380
to review the incident.

02:54.210 --> 02:55.180
A bar fight?

02:55.380 --> 02:57.440
Uncontrolled behavior
at its worst?

02:57.640 --> 03:00.100
I expect better
from anyone on the LAPD,

03:00.300 --> 03:03.400
but a SWAT officer?
Disgraceful.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.880
I'm sorry, sir.Damn right, you're sorry.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.630
You're riding the bench
for a month.

03:07.830 --> 03:09.500
What about 20-Squad?

03:09.700 --> 03:11.890
We've already discussed
replacement options.

03:12.090 --> 03:14.580
Is there anything you want
to say about this at all?

03:16.020 --> 03:18.460
I went out, had too much to
drink, I made a stupid choice.

03:18.660 --> 03:21.380
Mostly, I'm glad
nobody got seriously hurt.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.600
Desk duty starts today. I don't
care how hungover you are.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.770
Get to it.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.480
Stupid choice is
an understatement.

03:30.670 --> 03:33.000
[sighs]
Yeah, I'm frustrated
with him, too,

03:33.200 --> 03:35.050
but at least he took
his punishment standing up.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.000
This might not be
the end of it.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.310
Nichelle says the inspector
general's getting involved.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.830
That's ridiculous.

03:40.030 --> 03:41.960
I'll give the I.G. a call,
tell her we got it handled.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.130
You get started
on the paperwork.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.540
Deac.Just heard about Tan.

03:51.740 --> 03:53.930
How is he?Well, I saw him

03:54.130 --> 03:55.670
before he went in
with Hicks and Hondo.

03:55.870 --> 03:57.550
He's a little rough around
the edges, but he's okay.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.940
I'm just surprised.
He's not the type

03:59.140 --> 04:00.670
to lose control like that.

04:02.110 --> 04:03.940
You know something I don't.

04:04.140 --> 04:05.770
I heard something.

04:05.970 --> 04:07.470
It's kind of private.

04:07.670 --> 04:09.170
If Tan's not sharing, I can't.Okay.

04:09.370 --> 04:11.210
I can... I can respect that.

04:11.410 --> 04:13.650
Listen, Hondo's gonna be
tied up with this Tan situation.

04:13.850 --> 04:15.650
And Luca's in San Diego
all weekend with a T-lie thing.

04:15.850 --> 04:18.350
Well, we can't roll out
shorthanded.We won't.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.180
It's next man up.
50-Squad is off today

04:21.380 --> 04:22.790
so Rocker's agreed to join us.

04:22.990 --> 04:24.400
He's bringing one of his guys
with him.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.050
Oh, don't say it.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.840
Miguel Alfaro is available,
and he's solid.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.930
I don't have a problem
with his skills, Deacon.

04:31.130 --> 04:32.840
It's-it's the ego.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.150
ALFARO:
Hey.

04:34.350 --> 04:35.370
What's going on?

04:35.570 --> 04:37.020
Rest easy, 20-Squad.
Duty called,

04:37.220 --> 04:38.630
and the best
of the best answered.

04:38.830 --> 04:40.240
So you just
might be able

04:40.440 --> 04:41.980
to keep up with us?
That's good to know.

04:42.180 --> 04:42.980
Oh, today's gonna be fun.
Uh, Rocker's talking to Hondo.

04:43.180 --> 04:44.680
He'll be out in a second.

04:44.880 --> 04:45.990
DEACON:
I appreciate
you guys joining us.

04:46.180 --> 04:47.990
Why don't you go
get geared up?

04:48.190 --> 04:51.240
[laughs]
Please.

04:52.290 --> 04:56.560
It's just Powell's finally
started to drop the attitude.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.000
And the way Alfaro is...

04:58.200 --> 04:59.830
I don't know. I just...

05:00.020 --> 05:01.350
I don't want him
to trip her up,

05:01.550 --> 05:02.920
get her sliding back
into bad habits.
All right.

05:03.110 --> 05:04.860
Then we'll keep an eye on it.
It's just for one day.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.230
Sergeant Kay,

05:09.430 --> 05:11.360
this is Sergeant Samuel Clark
from Major Crimes.

05:11.560 --> 05:14.140
He's requested 20-Squad
execute a raid today

05:14.340 --> 05:16.150
on an Armenian crime ring,

05:16.350 --> 05:18.280
the culmination
of a lengthy investigation.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.500
The group is
about 12 men strong.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.150
Deals mainly in counterfeiting.
Their leader is David Nazarian.

05:23.350 --> 05:25.110
DEACON:
Yeah, I know this guy.
LAPD's been trying

05:25.310 --> 05:28.070
to build a case against him for
a long time, but charges never

05:28.270 --> 05:29.810
seem to stick.Well, they will this time.

05:30.010 --> 05:31.380
We've had an undercover
embedded for six months,

05:31.580 --> 05:32.810
gathering evidence.

05:33.010 --> 05:35.690
Erik Arkun.Alias Alex Gaspard.

05:35.890 --> 05:37.340
He's pretty young
to be an undercover.

05:37.540 --> 05:38.950
He's one of our best recruits.

05:39.150 --> 05:40.390
Arkun cracked
the ring's inner circle.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.780
Got invited
to a meet-up today

05:41.980 --> 05:43.170
where Nazarian
and seven of his men

05:43.370 --> 05:45.000
are gonna be processing
the latest batch

05:45.200 --> 05:47.130
of counterfeit bills.HICKS:
It'll give us an opportunity

05:47.330 --> 05:49.140
to finally catch
Nazarian red-handed.

05:49.330 --> 05:50.400
Get-together's at
an out-of-business restaurant.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.090

05:52.290 --> 05:53.710

will handle the raid.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.190
Roger that.

05:55.380 --> 05:57.710
Sergeant? Major Crimes
has invested a lot

05:57.910 --> 05:59.750
in developing
Arkun's cover.

05:59.950 --> 06:01.800
Want to keep it intact,
use him for a future operation.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.190
It's simple enough. We will
arrest your guy alongside

06:04.390 --> 06:06.980
Nazarian and the others,
we'll make it look like he got

06:07.180 --> 06:09.150
swept up in the raid.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.940
Goes without saying,

06:12.140 --> 06:15.900
Detective Arkun is my guy,
my responsibility.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.160
Yeah, getting him out safely
is SWAT's top priority.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.740
Major Crimes
is expecting nine guys total,

06:26.940 --> 06:28.350
including Nazarian
and their undercover.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.350
All right. Remember,
we're putting on a show.

06:30.550 --> 06:32.790
You find Detective Arkun, you
cuff him, just like the rest,

06:32.990 --> 06:34.490
but you ID him
over the radio

06:34.680 --> 06:36.180

Commander,
I chose Detective Arkun

09:46.440 --> 09:49.200
for this assignment personally,
and you saw that tape.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.030
If they've realized
he's a cop...

09:51.230 --> 09:52.810
I understand, Sergeant.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.600
Crime techs just called.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.900
They pulled
something interesting

09:56.100 --> 09:57.780
from a trash can
outside of the apartment.

09:57.970 --> 10:00.780
That's Arkun's handwriting.
He left behind a message.

10:00.980 --> 10:02.520
"N." Let's assume
that's Nazarian.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.220
"Into more than dollars." Has
your investigation suggested

10:05.420 --> 10:07.610
that Nazarian's into anything
other than counterfeiting?

10:07.810 --> 10:09.310
Well, Arkun had a theory

10:09.510 --> 10:11.700
that Nazarian was branching out,
but I never bought in.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.700
Well, it looks like Arkun
decided to pursue it on his own.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.880
At least that means
he stayed under voluntarily.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.580
So what are you saying?

10:17.780 --> 10:19.010
We leave him under?

10:19.210 --> 10:20.580
No. He's already attracted

10:20.780 --> 10:22.150
the wrong kind of attention.

10:22.350 --> 10:23.150
And when Nazarian hears
about the raid this morning,

10:23.350 --> 10:25.280
his situation's only
going to get worse.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.280
His instincts
about Nazarian may be correct,

10:27.480 --> 10:29.890
but I think we need
to pull your detective, ASAP.

10:30.090 --> 10:31.420
I agree, but first,
we have to find him.

10:31.620 --> 10:33.200
Well, we've already got
a BOLO out

10:33.400 --> 10:34.420
on the vehicle
they left the restaurant in.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.250
Good. Let's coordinate
with patrol and get unis

10:36.450 --> 10:38.810
checking Nazarian's known
properties and hangouts.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.990
The cops raided the restaurant.

10:43.190 --> 10:44.430
Heard on the way over.

10:44.630 --> 10:45.870
Fortunately, we were
already gone.

10:46.070 --> 10:48.300
Alex's intuition
paid off.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.090
Just saw a cop car parked
in a weird spot, that's all.

10:51.290 --> 10:53.480
They shouldn't have known
about the restaurant.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.820
Somebody's talking.

10:57.910 --> 11:01.100
And I think it's him.Whoa, whoa.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.100
I got us away
from the cops this morning.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.800
We bring him in for real
on the counterfeiting,

11:05.000 --> 11:06.370
and the police bust us.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.370
That's no coincidence.

11:08.570 --> 11:10.500
Or maybe your spot wasn't
as secure as you thought.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.460
We'd all be in lock-up
right now if not for Alex.

11:12.660 --> 11:14.680
Oh?Come on.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.550
Where is the truck?
Outside.

11:17.750 --> 11:18.510
Needs to be unloaded.

11:18.710 --> 11:20.120
Go get it done.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.210
I'm telling you,
we have a leak!

11:21.410 --> 11:22.640
I don't disagree.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.210
Someone is talking.

11:24.410 --> 11:26.690
Until we find out who,
no one leaves alone.

11:26.890 --> 11:29.000
I'm with you, Nazarian.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.220
I swear.NAZARIAN:
Then prove it.

11:31.420 --> 11:34.430
Give Peter your phone and
your gun, let him do his work.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.740
[scoffs]

11:49.750 --> 11:51.110
[knocking]

11:51.310 --> 11:52.760
Nothing from the BOLO yet.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.590
I had Major Crimes send over
their full file

11:54.790 --> 11:56.200
on the Armenian mob.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.030
Their investigation focused
on the counterfeiting,

11:58.230 --> 12:00.590
so, it's possible
they collected a hint

12:00.790 --> 12:02.680
of what Nazarian was expanding
into without knowing it.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.770
Yeah, could help us locate where
Nazarian took Detective Arkun.

12:05.970 --> 12:07.470
Yeah.
Street and Powell are
going through it right now.

12:07.670 --> 12:09.340
HICKS:
All right, good.Commander.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.780
Sorry to interrupt

12:10.980 --> 12:12.000
your busy day.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.910
Edward. I figured
the union would be

12:14.110 --> 12:15.960
sending you over
to see Tan.Yeah.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.920
The inspector general told me
she'd be making a recommendation

12:18.110 --> 12:19.660
about the incident.

12:19.860 --> 12:22.090
Well, she still hasn't
finalized her decision,

12:22.290 --> 12:24.270
but I asked Mr. Yannick
to join us

12:24.470 --> 12:26.490
so I could tell you
all at once.
Mm-hmm.

12:26.690 --> 12:29.930
The I.G. is leaning toward
a heavier punishment for Tan

12:30.130 --> 12:31.660
than what SWAT laid out.What?

12:32.790 --> 12:35.800
How much heavier?Two weeks suspension
without pay.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.850
Okay, wait a minute.

12:38.050 --> 12:40.500
This is Tan's first
and only conduct issue.

12:40.700 --> 12:43.420
He's been on SWAT for eight
years, he was Vice before that.

12:43.620 --> 12:44.810
Not one black mark
in his file.

12:45.010 --> 12:46.380
YANNICK:
This isn't about Tan.

12:46.580 --> 12:49.120
This is about City Hall
sending a statement.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.210
They've got
an image problem

12:51.410 --> 12:52.950
right on the heels
of those two Hollenbeck officers

12:53.150 --> 12:54.870
that got into trouble
last month.

12:55.060 --> 12:56.390
Yeah, brawling in a parking lot
after a basketball game.

12:56.590 --> 12:58.260
Press had
a field day with it.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.260
So Tan's getting swept up
into LAPD's damage control.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.310
Brass comes down hard on him,

13:02.510 --> 13:04.270
they mitigate some of
their bad PR for the department.

13:04.470 --> 13:06.920
You said the I.G. is leaning
toward a heavier punishment.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.140
We're meeting again
this afternoon

13:09.340 --> 13:10.710
to finalize a recommendation.

13:10.910 --> 13:12.450
Nichelle, you know Tan.

13:12.650 --> 13:14.230
You know this was
a one-off stupid mistake.

13:14.430 --> 13:15.490
You have to convince
the inspector general

13:15.690 --> 13:17.410
to leave the politics

13:17.610 --> 13:19.020
out of it.HONDO: We know this
is a lot to ask,

13:19.220 --> 13:21.540
and that the personal side of
this is probably causing trouble

13:21.740 --> 13:23.070
for you as it is.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.900
It's... not that.

13:25.090 --> 13:26.940
I believe

13:27.140 --> 13:28.900
in the recommendation
we're discussing.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.030
I think Tan
should be suspended.

13:32.230 --> 13:34.160
Just wanted to give you
a heads-up.

13:40.290 --> 13:41.510
Hey.

13:43.510 --> 13:46.220
I can't believe
you're supporting this.

13:46.420 --> 13:47.870
The panel talked about Tan
all morning.

13:48.070 --> 13:49.960
We went over all the statements,

13:50.160 --> 13:51.880
all the reports,
and yes, we did talk

13:52.080 --> 13:53.620
about those Hollenbeck officers,

13:53.820 --> 13:55.840
and maybe that influenced
some of the other auditors--

13:56.040 --> 13:57.410
I don't know-- but for me,

13:57.610 --> 13:59.540
this is about what Tan did.

13:59.740 --> 14:02.190
Nichelle, two weeks seems like
nothing, but a suspension...

14:02.390 --> 14:03.980
It'll affect
the rest of his career.

14:04.180 --> 14:06.280
It'll make getting promotions
harder to achieve.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.980
He will stall out.I didn't agree lightly,

14:08.180 --> 14:10.330
Hondo, but I do agree.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.330
And I knew this might upset you.

14:12.530 --> 14:14.210
That's part of why I came over
here to talk in person.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.030
Look, Hondo,
you're allowed to have

14:16.230 --> 14:17.860
complicated feelings
about this.

14:18.060 --> 14:20.170
Tan is your teammate.
You know him better than anyone.

14:20.370 --> 14:22.430
All right, just give me a chance
to figure out

14:22.630 --> 14:24.300
what's going on with my boy.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.780
Right now, I don't understand
his behavior.

14:25.980 --> 14:26.780
I don't know what I'm missing,

14:26.980 --> 14:28.000
but give me a chance.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.260
I'll see if I can
buy you some time.

14:34.650 --> 14:36.360
[sighs]

14:36.560 --> 14:39.190
Man, everything
Major Crimes collected

14:39.390 --> 14:40.880
is about counterfeiting.
Nothing points

14:41.080 --> 14:42.800
to what Nazarian's new
business might be.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.980
Guess I'm gonna lose five bucks.
Alfaro bet me that

14:46.180 --> 14:48.280
the unis searching Nazarian's
properties would get results

14:48.480 --> 14:50.630
faster than you and me
with these records.

14:50.830 --> 14:53.640
Just, uh, don't get caught up
in his games.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.640
Oh, it's just his humor.
He's fine.

14:55.840 --> 14:59.250
Actually, Alfaro told me I might
be perfect for Rocker's team.

14:59.450 --> 15:01.080
Too bad there's no open slots
on 50-Squad.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.430
He told me there's gonna be.

15:02.630 --> 15:04.650
Their P-II
is transferring out.

15:04.850 --> 15:07.390
You see, this is exactly
what I was worried about.

15:07.590 --> 15:09.170
Alfaro might act
like he's top dog,

15:09.370 --> 15:11.570
but he does not have
team authority like that.

15:11.770 --> 15:13.920
Hondo and Rocker
would have to go to Hicks,

15:14.120 --> 15:15.350
and that's
not happening.

15:15.550 --> 15:16.830
So, you don't think
it's a real offer?

15:17.030 --> 15:19.570
What I think is that
he sees me training you,

15:19.770 --> 15:21.660
so he's messing with you
to mess with me.

15:21.860 --> 15:23.580
It's-it's all nonsense.

15:23.780 --> 15:25.410
Okay.
What?

15:25.610 --> 15:28.060
Nothing.
Oh, go on, spill.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.450
You remember what it was like

15:29.650 --> 15:31.060
to be the problem child
on 20-Squad,

15:31.260 --> 15:32.720
every compliment
followed by a "but."

15:32.920 --> 15:34.240
Of course.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.720
It was just nice to have
a fellow SWAT officer

15:35.920 --> 15:36.640
say, "You're skilled,"

15:36.830 --> 15:39.120
end of sentence.Right.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.510
Unis finished searching

15:40.710 --> 15:42.340
Nazarian's properties
and hangouts.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.900
Not even a whiff of him
or Detective Arkun.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.600
Well, then we've officially
hit a dead end.

15:46.800 --> 15:50.170
Not necessarily. We still have
his guys down in holding.

15:50.370 --> 15:51.610
Uh, they're not talking.

15:51.810 --> 15:53.870
No, but I think
this guy might.

15:54.070 --> 15:55.350
POWELL:
Adam Grigoryan. According to
Sergeant Clark's charts,

15:55.550 --> 15:57.220
he's lowest on the totem pole.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.790
So, he's the least trusted.
He's not gonna know anything.

15:59.990 --> 16:02.750
Maybe he doesn't have to.
Just go with me on this.

16:02.950 --> 16:04.230
According to the file,

16:04.430 --> 16:06.320
Nazarian does not have
a driver's license.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.190
This guy takes him everywhere.

16:08.390 --> 16:11.970
So, he may not know what's
going on, but he'll know where.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.370
Already told you,
I'm not talking.[door closes]

16:18.570 --> 16:21.460
Well, that's a shame.
You got no priors,

16:21.660 --> 16:23.730
had no weapon on you
this morning.

16:23.930 --> 16:24.860
STREET:Yeah, the only charge
is counterfeiting,

16:25.060 --> 16:26.030
that's a wobbler.

16:26.230 --> 16:27.770
A wobbler?

16:27.970 --> 16:30.170
The D.A. gets to decide
if it's a felony or misdemeanor.

16:30.370 --> 16:32.210
Big difference between doing
some serious hard time

16:32.410 --> 16:34.080
or summary probation.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.260
STREET:You're not even really
one of them. All you did

16:36.460 --> 16:37.780
was drive
Nazarian around.

16:37.980 --> 16:39.830
Okay? You really want
to spend the next decade

16:40.030 --> 16:41.000
in prison for that?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.090
We don't even want
to know anything

16:42.290 --> 16:43.530
about Nazarian's
operation,

16:43.730 --> 16:45.490
or what he does.
You keep that to yourself.

16:45.690 --> 16:48.010
All we want to know is where
you spend your time, Adam.

16:48.210 --> 16:49.800
We've already
checked out

16:49.990 --> 16:52.180
Nazarian's properties.
What are we missing?

16:53.490 --> 16:55.800
I just tell you
where else we go,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.980
and you'll talk
to the D.A. for me?

16:58.180 --> 16:59.320
I got her
on speed dial.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.510
Sometimes, we visit
an office building downtown.

17:08.710 --> 17:10.370
And yesterday,
we went to a warehouse.

17:12.550 --> 17:14.640
Show us.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.740
Warehouse is up ahead.

17:17.940 --> 17:19.430
All right, Street and Rocker
just finished a walk-through

17:19.630 --> 17:21.260
of the office building
Grigoryan gave up.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.180
No sign of Nazarian
or Arkun.

17:23.380 --> 17:25.660
Then let's hope the warehouse
gets us something.

17:25.860 --> 17:27.570
DISPATCHER [over radio]:
Dispatch to 30-David.

17:27.770 --> 17:29.660
30-David.DISPATCHER: 911 operator
just received

17:29.860 --> 17:31.710
a medical call from the address
you're headed to.

17:31.910 --> 17:33.880
Male, late-20s, cardiac
and respiratory distress.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.710
911 call?

17:35.910 --> 17:38.410
No, the warehouse can't be
Nazarian's business spot.

17:38.610 --> 17:40.280
He'd let his men die
before calling the authorities

17:40.480 --> 17:42.020
to his own door.It could be a trap,

17:42.220 --> 17:44.150
but if it's real,
we're the closest unit.

17:44.350 --> 17:46.160
All right,
take the med kit.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.770
We go in,
but we stay on alert.

17:47.970 --> 17:50.670
30-David, responding.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.470
All right, Powell,
set up a perimeter.

17:58.670 --> 18:00.000
Wait for the EMTs.Roger that.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.080
Two workers, appear unarmed.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.350
All right,
clear out, fellas.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.480
Typical
shipping equipment.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.000
But these aren't
Nazarian's guys.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.050
All right.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.310
LAPD.

18:10.510 --> 18:11.220
Responding to a 911 call.[gasps]

18:11.420 --> 18:12.920
He's over here.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.050
He's having a seizure. Please.DEACON: All right.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.580
Hey, what happened?

18:15.780 --> 18:17.060
WORKER:
One of the crates
fell from the shelf.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.360
Jesse went to clean it up,
and he started

18:18.560 --> 18:19.710
coughing like crazy.

18:19.910 --> 18:21.020
DEACON: Whoa, whoa,
that's powder residue.

18:21.220 --> 18:22.020
That could be
drug exposure.

18:22.220 --> 18:23.060
Everybody out of here now.

18:23.260 --> 18:24.360
Let's go.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.850
He's got blue lips,
difficulty breathing.

18:29.050 --> 18:29.980
Looks like opiates,

18:30.180 --> 18:32.280
could be fentanyl.Come on.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.280
Need to hit him with Narcan.

18:38.590 --> 18:40.990
All right, administering
Narcan now.

18:41.190 --> 18:42.600
Is Jesse gonna be okay?

18:42.800 --> 18:45.000
Narcan blocks opiates
in the system, it should help.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.390
It's not working.

18:46.590 --> 18:47.480
Come on, come on, come on.
All right.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.470
Administering
second dose.

18:52.950 --> 18:56.140
We got here within minutes,
it should be working.

18:56.340 --> 18:59.710
There's no pulse.
He's gone.

18:59.910 --> 19:01.540
[sirens blaring]

19:01.740 --> 19:03.750
ALFARO:
All right, everybody,
move, move.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.280
EMTs tested, confirmed that
it was an opiate exposure,

19:08.480 --> 19:09.760
but it was not
fentanyl.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.760
It's nothing that
they've seen before.

19:11.960 --> 19:13.550
Listen, Commander,
whatever it is, it's potent.

19:13.750 --> 19:14.680
We responded quickly.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.120
I-I gave the poor guy two doses

19:16.320 --> 19:17.730
of Narcan to no effect.

19:17.930 --> 19:19.250
So, we're dealing with
a powerful new mystery drug.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.730
[scoffs] Not welcome news.
Any sign

19:21.930 --> 19:23.990
of Nazarian
or Arkun there?

19:24.190 --> 19:25.390
No, we swept the place.
All clear.

19:25.590 --> 19:27.040
Commander, we did talk
to the manager.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.650
He said that the-the crate
that the drugs were in

19:28.850 --> 19:30.390
was part of a larger shipment
that got picked up

19:30.590 --> 19:32.830
last night. This one
must've got left behind.

19:33.030 --> 19:34.440
All right.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.610
So, this must be the new
business Arkun caught wind of.

19:36.810 --> 19:39.100
Nazarian's branching out
into the L.A. drug scene.

19:39.290 --> 19:40.620
Doing a damn fine job.

19:40.820 --> 19:42.190
He's got crates of a
dangerous unknown opiate,

19:42.380 --> 19:43.660
LAPD officer,

19:43.860 --> 19:45.530
and he's dropped
completely off of our radar.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.440
Damn it.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.200
Talk to me.Narcotics lab took a look

19:55.400 --> 19:56.850
at the mystery drug they found
at the warehouse.

19:57.050 --> 19:59.460
They ID'd it as isotonitazene,
street name "Iso."

19:59.660 --> 20:02.160
It's a cutting-edge
synthetic opiate.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.950
It's even deadlier
than fentanyl.

20:04.150 --> 20:06.080
Crack down on one drug,
someone engineers a newer,

20:06.280 --> 20:08.210
scarier option.ROCKER: Got to be
what Arkun meant

20:08.410 --> 20:10.470
when he said Nazarian was
into something more dangerous.

20:10.670 --> 20:12.350
But we've been all over
Nazarian for a year.

20:12.550 --> 20:13.870
Never found
any trace of drugs

20:14.070 --> 20:17.220
or processing equipment
at any of the known warehouses.

20:17.420 --> 20:18.310
Well, he must have a location
you don't know about.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.480
A place to hide drugs
and Arkun.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.880
Okay, but the problem is, we
have no idea where the Iso went

20:22.080 --> 20:23.440
once it left the warehouse

20:23.640 --> 20:26.320
and no way to track it.Actually, we might.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.450
According to Narcotics,
you need something

20:27.650 --> 20:30.100
called phenylacetic acid
to refine the Iso.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.630
Now, it can be
purchased legally,

20:31.830 --> 20:32.970
but, because it's
a controlled substance,

20:33.170 --> 20:34.980
the FDA tracks it.

20:35.180 --> 20:36.670
Well, if we can get
the purchase records for L.A.,

20:36.870 --> 20:38.070
maybe we can ID
Nazarian's transaction,

20:38.270 --> 20:39.500
see where
it was shipped.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.150
I'll make that call.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.290
That's the last of them.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.290
Hey, hold up.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.960
Stepping out for a smoke.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.480
No one leaves,

21:01.680 --> 21:03.270
especially not you.Okay.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.430
Okay.

21:07.520 --> 21:08.880
Can I have
my phone back yet?

21:09.080 --> 21:10.530
I'm not done with it.

21:13.310 --> 21:14.760
ARKUN:
You're wasting your time.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.370
You're not gonna find
anything on there.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.180
We'll see.

21:29.020 --> 21:30.770
Heard you guys are looking
for a missing undercover.

21:30.970 --> 21:32.560
Yeah, but I realized

21:32.760 --> 21:34.860
I hadn't taken a minute
to see how you're doing.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.950
I feel stupid,
but I'm fine.

21:38.150 --> 21:39.820
Tan.

21:40.020 --> 21:41.090
It's really hard for me
to imagine you snapping

21:41.290 --> 21:43.000
just 'cause you had
a couple of drinks.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.990
I can feel something's up,
so talk to me.

21:46.950 --> 21:48.350
Your ring's gone.

21:48.550 --> 21:50.230
What?

21:50.430 --> 21:53.790
Your wedding ring.Yeah.

21:53.990 --> 21:56.880
Guess I don't know
what to do with it.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.100
Bonnie and I are over.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.320
Over? What happened?

22:01.520 --> 22:03.850
She cheated on me.
Found out a couple days ago.

22:04.050 --> 22:06.940
I went to the bar because, well,
not taking it so well.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.590
Tan, why didn't you say
anything? If I had known you...

22:09.790 --> 22:11.290
There's nothing
you could've done.

22:11.490 --> 22:14.470
Doesn't matter now. It's not
a secret anymore anyway.

22:14.670 --> 22:17.420
Sorry, boss.
I need another coffee.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.740
STREET:
Hey.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.610
Hicks reached out
to the FDA.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.180
Hopefully, there's something
in their purchase records

22:26.370 --> 22:27.790
we can use
to find Nazarian's lab.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.430
Great.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.920
Something else?
Look, um,

22:33.120 --> 22:35.970
please, just stop messing
with Powell.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.320
Uh... I'm not.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.670
Well, I mean, you basically
told her she could switch

22:40.870 --> 22:43.710
to Rocker's team,
which we both know isn't true.

22:43.910 --> 22:46.280
Listen, I'm sorry. Maybe I
shouldn't have said anything.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.630
Look, Powell and I have been
working really hard to get her

22:48.830 --> 22:50.330
trained up
to be on 20-Squad.

22:50.530 --> 22:52.290
You're lucky Hicks
didn't hear this little joke.

22:52.490 --> 22:54.160
I mean, he takes team
assignments really seriously.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.250
I know he does because Rocker
told me how big a deal it was

22:57.450 --> 22:58.950
that Hicks approved us
approaching Powell.

22:59.150 --> 23:02.080
Hicks approved her
switching squads?Yeah.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.040
I might've jumped the gun
talking to Powell about it,

23:05.240 --> 23:06.870
but I wasn't
making it up.

23:07.070 --> 23:08.130
If Hicks signed off on it,
that means

23:08.330 --> 23:09.650
Hondo must've approved
the trade, too.

23:09.850 --> 23:11.870
I assume so.

23:12.070 --> 23:13.660
Look, between
you and me,

23:13.860 --> 23:15.270
look, I heard she had
some problems,

23:15.470 --> 23:17.400
but from what I've seen today,
she's doing great.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.180
Yeah, I thought she was, too.

23:25.310 --> 23:26.840
Heard the FDA
got back to us.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.060
Yep. Got a list
of phenylacetic acid purchases

23:29.260 --> 23:31.280
over the last
few months.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.550
Doesn't look like Nazarian used
any of his shell companies

23:33.750 --> 23:35.330
or his crew members
to make the purchase.

23:35.530 --> 23:37.640
POWELL:
Gorgeous Beauty Supply,

23:37.840 --> 23:39.990
owner is Ellen Ohanyan.
Why is that name familiar?

23:40.190 --> 23:42.380
CLARK:
Because you read it
in Major Crimes' files.

23:42.580 --> 23:43.990
She's Nazarian's daughter.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.690
Estranged

23:45.890 --> 23:48.000
for most of her life,
she reached out to Nazarian

23:48.200 --> 23:49.870
after her mother died
a couple months ago.

23:50.070 --> 23:51.220
Is it possible Ellen's involved

23:51.420 --> 23:52.480
in Nazarian's
criminal activities?

23:52.680 --> 23:54.050
LAPD had no reason
to suspect

23:54.240 --> 23:56.350
Ellen of anything,

23:56.550 --> 23:58.050
and that beauty supply
store is real.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.230
Yeah, but maybe that's why
Nazarian used her.

24:00.420 --> 24:01.530
Ellen could purchase
the chemicals

24:01.730 --> 24:03.270
he needed without
raising any flags.

24:03.470 --> 24:05.010
Where was it delivered?

24:05.210 --> 24:06.800
Wasn't delivered.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.020
FDA says the phenylacetic acid
was claimed

24:10.220 --> 24:11.760
in person
from a depot.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.800
So, we still don't know
where Nazarian took the Iso

24:14.000 --> 24:15.810
or Detective Arkun.DEACON: Yeah, but we now know

24:16.010 --> 24:17.290
about Ellen.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.030
Pull her property records.
It's possible

24:19.230 --> 24:21.190
Nazarian's hiding more
behind her name.

24:23.670 --> 24:24.680
Commander.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.380
Yeah?I spoke to Tan.

24:26.580 --> 24:28.950
He's got something
personal going on

24:29.150 --> 24:31.390
that fed into what happened
last night.All right.

24:31.590 --> 24:33.740
Well, we should call Nichelle
and explain the circumstance.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.870
Maybe she'll change her mind
and get the I.G.

24:36.070 --> 24:38.390
to cut Tan a break.This isn't about Nichelle
or the inspector general.

24:38.590 --> 24:39.830
It's about Tan. I'm worried.

24:40.030 --> 24:42.090
Last night, he snapped
and got in a bar fight.

24:42.290 --> 24:44.140
Uh-huh.Today, it's like
he's completely numb.

24:44.340 --> 24:46.320
Now, what he told me explains
some of it, but I don't know.

24:46.510 --> 24:47.840
Something
still ain't right.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.490
Well, he's in
a bad place.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.360
Sounds like
his marriage is over.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.980
I had no idea they were
having trouble.I guess it was recent.

24:55.180 --> 24:58.460
But what's killing me is
he never said a word about it.

24:58.660 --> 24:59.940
Deacon tells me
that some of the team

25:00.140 --> 25:01.770
knew something was going on,
but they didn't feel like

25:01.960 --> 25:03.900
it was their place to share,
and I hate that.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.810
[phone buzzing]I hate that Tan's been hurting
all alone. That's my guy.

25:06.010 --> 25:08.340
I should've noticed.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.630
Deacon found something.
Let's go.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.480
Sergeant Clark went back over
to Major Crimes.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.000
I wanted to look
at my notes,

25:18.200 --> 25:19.350
see if there's
anything useful

25:19.550 --> 25:21.310
that didn't make it
into Nazarian's file.

25:21.510 --> 25:23.440
He was able to dig up
some of Ellen's records.What'd you find?

25:23.640 --> 25:25.050
Well, Nazarian's daughter
has her storefront,

25:25.250 --> 25:27.230
condo, plus her mother's
old storage unit

25:27.420 --> 25:28.750
and a house in the Valley.

25:28.950 --> 25:30.620
So, if Nazarian is using
one of her places to hide,

25:30.820 --> 25:31.710
he's got options to choose from.

25:31.910 --> 25:33.360
Yeah, but there's more.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.280
Major Crimes was right,
the beauty shop

25:35.480 --> 25:37.760
is legit, but I took a harder
look at her other financials.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.760
The-the bank statements,
the accounts,

25:39.960 --> 25:41.370
they-they
don't add up.

25:41.570 --> 25:43.280
But looking through
past investigations,

25:43.480 --> 25:47.290
it's clear Ellen's been hiding
money for Nazarian for years.

25:47.490 --> 25:48.380
She's the missing piece.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.990
So, Nazarian wasn't using her.

25:50.190 --> 25:51.550
Ellen's up to her neck
in the family business.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.030
Yeah, and now,
she's helping Nazarian

25:53.230 --> 25:54.510
expand into the drug trade.

25:54.710 --> 25:57.080
Okay, at one point,
Arkun was working Ellen,

25:57.280 --> 25:59.820
softening her with the thought
of turning her into a C.I.

26:00.020 --> 26:02.090
So, if he doesn't suspect her,
and he gets into a tight spot,

26:02.290 --> 26:03.780
he might look to Ellen
as a potential ally.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.440
All the more reason
to find him fast.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.430
Let's narrow this down.

26:11.220 --> 26:13.660
Told you so.

26:13.860 --> 26:15.530
If you haven't found
anything by now,

26:15.730 --> 26:18.270
you're not going to.[scoffs]

26:21.360 --> 26:25.240
Nazarian asked me
to look into you, so I am.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.980
At the end of the day,
he trusts me.

26:28.180 --> 26:29.980
When I tell Nazarian

26:30.180 --> 26:33.500
something is off with you,
it's game over.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.430
I'm loyal.

26:36.620 --> 26:38.640
[laughs] Yeah,
keep practicing that.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.720
It's not gonna
save you.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.030
[door opens]

26:45.820 --> 26:48.000
Hey, Ellen,
you got a second?

26:48.200 --> 26:49.920
For you? Always.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.480
I'm glad you're here.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.050
Seeing you
is basically

26:53.250 --> 26:54.310
the silver lining
to being dragged out here,

26:54.510 --> 26:56.750
so...Listen, um,

26:56.950 --> 26:59.100
your father and I
are-are kind of on,

26:59.300 --> 27:02.100
uh, dicey footing
right now.

27:02.300 --> 27:05.850
We talked about this. You know
I don't care what my dad thinks.

27:06.050 --> 27:08.720
Hey, don't worry.
Whatever it is, it'll blow over.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.150
Not this time.

27:13.580 --> 27:15.070
Ellen, I'm a cop,

27:15.270 --> 27:17.160
and the net is about to close
on your father, but I can

27:17.360 --> 27:19.250
keep you clear of it,
if you help me.

27:19.450 --> 27:21.510
You're LAPD?Listen to me,

27:21.710 --> 27:22.910
you're not a part
of Nazarian's world.

27:23.110 --> 27:25.170
You don't have to
get dragged down with him.

27:25.370 --> 27:27.820
I don't understand.Don't be afraid.

27:28.020 --> 27:30.390
Just tell Peter you need
my help with something.

27:30.590 --> 27:31.870
I can get outof here,

27:32.070 --> 27:34.610
and my boss can get you
into witness protection.

27:34.810 --> 27:36.570
And immunity?

27:36.770 --> 27:38.440
Full immunity.I will call

27:38.640 --> 27:40.700
the D.A. myself to ask.

27:42.350 --> 27:44.750
Okay.

27:44.950 --> 27:47.530
Yeah. Let me
go talk to Peter.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.780
Ellen's condo is a loft.
It's not an ideal spot

28:08.980 --> 28:10.560
for Nazarian to refine his Iso.
It's too small.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.830
That still leaves three places
they could've taken Arkun.

28:13.030 --> 28:15.000
The storefront
might be too public?

28:15.200 --> 28:16.530
The shop itself, sure,

28:16.720 --> 28:18.480
but there's a whole stockroom
in the back.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.790
Storage unit and the house
are large and private enough.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.360
[phone buzzes]Hold on, that's my private
number. Give me a second.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.010
Does Nazarian need anything else
to process the Iso?

28:26.210 --> 28:27.490
A furnace, some equipment?

28:27.690 --> 28:29.580
No. It's kitchen chemistry
at this point.

28:29.780 --> 28:31.100
He could do it at any one
of these places.CLARK: It's Arkun.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.670
But the call's not coming
from his number.

28:33.870 --> 28:35.150
What did you do?

28:35.350 --> 28:36.680
ARKUN:Ellen,

28:36.880 --> 28:37.940
don't do this.

28:38.140 --> 28:39.370
He wanted me
to help him.

28:39.570 --> 28:40.550
He said he's a cop.

28:40.750 --> 28:41.940
PETER:
I knew it.

28:42.140 --> 28:43.420
HICKS:
He must've tried to use Ellen.

28:43.620 --> 28:45.290
His cover's blown.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.250
All right, but he got
his hands on a phone.

28:47.450 --> 28:48.510
Clark, conference us in.
If the line stays open,

28:48.710 --> 28:50.030
we can trace the call.

28:52.030 --> 28:53.780
Don't move.

28:53.980 --> 28:56.300
So, you're LAPD, huh?

28:56.500 --> 28:57.390
Come on.

28:57.590 --> 29:00.260
Are you linked up yet?Almost.

29:00.460 --> 29:02.480
PETER:
Can't wait to tell Nazarian
I was right all along.

29:02.680 --> 29:05.220
ARKUN:
Get off me. Get off me!

29:09.000 --> 29:11.450
Got the trace.

29:11.650 --> 29:14.450
All right, the cell signal
pinged off that tower, and

29:14.650 --> 29:16.240
that's within range of Ellen's
mother's house in the Valley.

29:16.440 --> 29:17.540
HONDO:That's got to be
where they took him.

29:17.740 --> 29:19.200
That's Nazarian's hideout.Deacon, get over there.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.020
They know he's a cop.
They're gonna kill him.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.720
SWAT will never get there
in time.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.460
Oh, we have our ways.

29:24.660 --> 29:28.210
PILOT:
Okay, we're about a half klick
from the L.Z.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.770
Infrared drone showed
six heat signatures.

29:29.970 --> 29:31.640
One of them
should be Arkun.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.040
All right, listen up.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.650
Bird got us here quick,
but we lose

29:34.850 --> 29:38.390
the element of surprise,
so keep heads on swivels.

29:38.590 --> 29:39.900
ETA to drop site is one mike.

29:44.390 --> 29:46.310
PILOT:
Estimate in 400.

29:46.510 --> 29:47.870
DEACON:
Let's get ready to drop!

29:50.910 --> 29:52.660
Just let me kill him.

29:52.860 --> 29:54.230
We need to know what information
he passed on to the cops first.

29:54.430 --> 29:57.020
You ready to start talking?

29:57.220 --> 29:58.930
ELLEN:
He needed my help

29:59.130 --> 30:01.060
to get away. I mean, the police
can't know he's here, right?

30:01.260 --> 30:02.840
Do they know about the drugs?

30:04.800 --> 30:06.770
You are going to tell me.

30:06.970 --> 30:09.110
[helicopter whirring]

30:13.890 --> 30:15.170
Chopper!

30:15.360 --> 30:17.860
How did they
find us, huh?

30:18.060 --> 30:19.080
You two, load up what you can.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.990
He is coming with me.

30:22.290 --> 30:24.480
PILOT: Checking for hazards.OFFICER: Prepare the rope!

30:24.680 --> 30:26.650
PILOT: Okay, looks clear.OFFICER: Roger.

30:28.470 --> 30:30.210
OFFICER:
We're good back here.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.620
OFFICER 2: Rope line's away.
Ropes are coming down.

30:34.820 --> 30:36.400
Lines in place.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.840
All right, once we're down,

30:38.040 --> 30:38.970
Street, Alfaro,
and Powell,

30:39.170 --> 30:40.320
you get inside
that house.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.060
Rocker, you and I'll
hook around the front.

30:43.260 --> 30:44.850
First team ready?Ready.

30:45.050 --> 30:46.460
Ready.

30:46.660 --> 30:48.450
We got your backs.
Send them.

30:52.630 --> 30:53.930
ROCKER:
Got guys coming for us.

30:55.720 --> 30:56.850
[gunshots]

31:01.900 --> 31:03.210
STREET:
We're on the ground.

31:03.410 --> 31:05.130
Suspects have gone back inside.

31:05.330 --> 31:06.910
DEACON:
Stand by.

31:07.110 --> 31:08.090
Second team ready?Ready.

31:08.290 --> 31:10.080
Ready.
Send them.

31:19.740 --> 31:21.090
Third roper ready.

31:23.350 --> 31:24.450
He's out on the left.

31:24.650 --> 31:25.980
Halfway.

31:26.170 --> 31:27.500
Copy.[indistinct chatter]

31:27.700 --> 31:29.070
OFFICER: Check.DEACON: I'm down!

31:29.260 --> 31:31.150
Helicopter clear.

31:31.350 --> 31:33.420
PILOT:
Go, go, go.

31:33.620 --> 31:36.900
Go, go, go, go!

31:37.100 --> 31:38.720
OFFICER:
Rope's clear.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.160
Get two.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.160
Two. Powell!

32:01.040 --> 32:03.060
LAPD! Drop your weapons!Drop your weapons!

32:03.260 --> 32:05.010
Drop your weapon!

32:06.620 --> 32:08.760
Drop it.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.060
One suspect down.

32:10.260 --> 32:12.330
Drop your weapon.

32:12.530 --> 32:15.330
On your knees.
Hands behind your back.

32:15.530 --> 32:18.020
Second suspect in custody.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.330
[gunshot]

32:24.680 --> 32:26.170
Hands behind your back.

32:26.370 --> 32:28.160
Third suspect in custody.

32:33.950 --> 32:35.310
[car engine starts]Outside.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.920
LAPD.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.530
Let's go. Come on.Let him go, Nazarian.

32:38.730 --> 32:41.530
Let him go.No!

32:41.730 --> 32:42.750
Don't move.

32:42.950 --> 32:44.880
Hands behind
your head.

32:45.080 --> 32:48.140
Nazarian's getting away in a
black SUV. He's still got Arkun.

32:53.310 --> 32:55.790
STREET:
Nazarian's heading for the gate.

32:56.620 --> 32:57.540
Rocker!

32:59.580 --> 33:00.810
On your knees now.

33:01.010 --> 33:03.460
30-David, we're on him.

33:03.660 --> 33:05.110
[truck engine starts]

33:06.850 --> 33:07.940
[tires screech]

33:15.340 --> 33:18.040
Nazarian's not
an experienced driver,

33:18.240 --> 33:19.120
and this is a narrow road.

33:27.650 --> 33:29.050
[horn honking]

33:32.830 --> 33:35.100
DEACON:
Hang on.

33:46.930 --> 33:48.280
We need a little more.

33:54.980 --> 33:56.810
Gaining.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.780
[grunts]

34:15.830 --> 34:17.800
Show me your hands.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.790
Out of the car.

34:21.270 --> 34:23.070
You okay, Detective?[grunts] Yeah.

34:23.260 --> 34:27.110
On your knees. Now.
It's over, Nazarian.

34:27.310 --> 34:29.200
Very glad to see you guys.Right back at you.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.160
50-David to Command,
we have Arkun, safe and sound.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.430
30-David. We are Code Four.

34:35.620 --> 34:38.330
[indistinct radio chatter]

34:41.070 --> 34:42.610
LAFD swept the house,

34:42.810 --> 34:45.090
found Nazarian's
stockpile of Iso.

34:45.290 --> 34:47.480
Looks like we're gonna be able
to recover all of it.All right.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.740
And Ellen Ohanyan,
she's offering to testify

34:49.940 --> 34:50.960
against her father.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.400
For my money,
Ellen blew her chance

34:52.600 --> 34:54.140
when she
ratted out Arkun,

34:54.340 --> 34:55.790
but the D.A.
can sort that out.

34:55.990 --> 34:57.490
Detective Arkun.

34:57.690 --> 34:59.710
Sergeant Clark's
on his way.

34:59.910 --> 35:02.150
I'm glad to see we're gonna be
able to hand you back to him

35:02.350 --> 35:05.150
in one piece.Barely. [chuckles]

35:05.350 --> 35:07.760
Seriously, SWAT's the reason
I'm alive right now.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.330
Hey, you are the one
that put it all on the line.

35:10.530 --> 35:12.510
LAPD's gonna finally
be able to close the book

35:12.710 --> 35:15.550
on Nazarian's full operation
because of your good work.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.420
Congratulations,
Detective.

35:17.620 --> 35:19.690
Well, I'm gonna go,
uh, get patched up.

35:19.890 --> 35:22.120
Take care.

35:23.990 --> 35:25.690
Well, I got to say,

35:25.890 --> 35:27.520
I expected at least
half a dozen wisecracks

35:27.720 --> 35:30.090
from Rocker about
50-Squad's superiority, but

35:30.290 --> 35:32.130
he's not so bad.Nah, he'll do in a pinch.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.870
Today was about
coming together.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.450
Hey, Hondo.

35:42.650 --> 35:45.060
I know it's been a day,
but I got to talk to you.

35:45.260 --> 35:46.500
What's up?

35:46.700 --> 35:49.330
Alfaro said that
you and Rocker got permission

35:49.520 --> 35:51.590
to trade Powell
to 50-Squad.

35:51.790 --> 35:54.420
Do you think that-that
I've failed with her?Okay, hold up, Street.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.940
No one said that.

35:56.140 --> 35:57.330
None of this was supposed
to be public knowledge.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.290
I was gonna talk to you
this morning.

35:59.490 --> 36:02.120
But then Tan's thing happened.Yeah, yeah, it sure did.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.340
But you still shouldn't have
heard it from someone else.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.600
That's on me.So, I-I don't understand.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.040
Are you trying
to get rid of Powell?No. Look, you've helped

36:08.240 --> 36:11.260
Powell hone her instincts,
curb that attitude.

36:11.460 --> 36:12.910
We haven't had a problem
with her in months.

36:13.110 --> 36:15.050
So, why approve
the trade offer?

36:15.250 --> 36:18.050
Powell had a rough start
with us, to say the least,

36:18.250 --> 36:19.660
but I've been
watching her lately,

36:19.860 --> 36:21.710
and it just made me wonder
if she might not appreciate

36:21.900 --> 36:23.750
a fresh start
with another team.

36:23.950 --> 36:26.840
I don't want
to force her out.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.230
I want to give her
the option.

36:29.430 --> 36:30.760
She wants to be
on 20-Squad.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.240
All right,
listen to me.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.200
The hardest part of being
someone else's mentor,

36:35.400 --> 36:36.850
is getting to that moment
when you realize

36:37.050 --> 36:38.290
that you
got to step back

36:38.490 --> 36:41.810
and let them decide.[sighs]

36:42.010 --> 36:45.560
Way back when, I was terrified
to let you pick your own path.

36:45.750 --> 36:48.690
I thought that if I didn't guide
every little decision,

36:48.890 --> 36:50.210
that you would
pick wrong.

36:50.410 --> 36:51.820
I mean, I did.
I left the team.

36:52.020 --> 36:53.820
Was it wrong?

36:54.020 --> 36:57.480
You came back stronger
and more dialed in.

36:57.680 --> 37:00.000
I stopped hovering,

37:00.200 --> 37:01.740
and look at you now.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.100
I hear you.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.880
I just really don't want her
to trade out.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.350
Her choice to make.

37:19.140 --> 37:21.110
Tan?

37:21.310 --> 37:22.420
I didn't finish
filing everything,

37:22.620 --> 37:24.770
but I'll get back
to it tomorrow.

37:24.970 --> 37:26.550
What's going on?

37:26.750 --> 37:27.860
Tan, your employment status

37:28.060 --> 37:29.990
has been taken out
of SWAT's hands.

37:30.190 --> 37:32.600
HICKS:The inspector general
made a tougher recommendation

37:32.800 --> 37:34.130
to the brass.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.480
Chief called me five minutes ago
and confirmed it.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.220
You've been suspended.

37:39.420 --> 37:40.740
YANNICK:
It's just for two weeks,

37:40.940 --> 37:42.130
but if you want to appeal
the decision...

37:42.330 --> 37:44.480
It's fine.
Anything else?

37:44.680 --> 37:46.430
You're gonna need to surrender
your service weapon.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.400
And your badge.

38:01.100 --> 38:04.590
I'll see you soon, Officer.
If you need anything...

38:04.790 --> 38:06.510
No, sir.
I'll get my head on straight.

38:06.710 --> 38:07.930
You don't need to worry.

38:15.070 --> 38:17.780
Hey.Hey.

38:17.980 --> 38:19.430
Listen, uh,
about Alfaro...

38:19.630 --> 38:22.390
Oh. I should've known
he was blowing smoke.

38:22.590 --> 38:24.220
As it turns out,

38:24.420 --> 38:26.610
he wasn't.

38:26.810 --> 38:29.700
Yeah, I, uh, just
talked to Hondo, and

38:29.900 --> 38:33.050
there is going to be
an open slot on 50-Squad,

38:33.250 --> 38:36.230
and it's yours, if you want it.

38:36.430 --> 38:39.630
Wow. It's real?Yeah, it's real.

38:39.830 --> 38:41.240
Huh.
Hey,

38:41.440 --> 38:44.500
before you make
any decisions... [sighs]

38:44.700 --> 38:47.720
just know that
everyone on 20-Squad

38:47.920 --> 38:50.640
knows that you are
an amazing SWAT officer,

38:50.840 --> 38:52.940
no caveats attached.

38:53.140 --> 38:55.340
Street, you, uh...

38:55.540 --> 38:57.770
you do push me to be better.
I get that.

38:57.970 --> 38:59.860
Well, good, 'cause
that's not gonna change,

39:00.060 --> 39:02.560
no matter what, even if you do
switch to Rocker's team.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.700
Of course, that's gonna make
the inter-squad relay

39:05.890 --> 39:07.180
really complicated
considering I'm gonna be

39:07.370 --> 39:09.090
trying to sabotage you
and cheer you on,

39:09.290 --> 39:11.180
but whatever.

39:11.380 --> 39:13.010
We'll make it work.

39:13.210 --> 39:15.710
Because you're my friend,

39:15.900 --> 39:19.050
and I support whatever
you choose. Cool?

39:20.530 --> 39:21.400
Cool.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.410
I know what I want.

39:28.610 --> 39:31.160
Well, I mean, I-I think
you have a little time.

39:31.350 --> 39:32.680
You don't have to rush it
or anything.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.330
No, I don't need time.
I'm staying on 20-Squad.

39:36.530 --> 39:38.680
I came in
with some baggage,

39:38.880 --> 39:41.600
and I'm still
getting over it, but...

39:41.800 --> 39:44.730
you guys make me feel like
I'm up for the challenge.

39:44.930 --> 39:47.520
No matter how hard
you make it.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.600
I'll see you tomorrow.See you tomorrow.

39:55.610 --> 39:56.880
Hey.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.480
Come on in.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.580
Boss, I understand
why I'm suspended.

40:06.780 --> 40:08.580
I'm not fighting it.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.760
Maybe it'll be good for me.
I'm gonna take the time,

40:10.960 --> 40:14.020
and think
everything over.

40:14.220 --> 40:15.070
I didn't invite you
over here

40:15.270 --> 40:17.420
for a lecture.

40:17.620 --> 40:20.150
We just thought you might like
some dinner and some company.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.640
You not coming in to HQ
doesn't mean

40:23.840 --> 40:25.990
we're not here for whatever
you might need.

40:26.190 --> 40:29.170
And if that's just spaghetti
and mindless gossip,

40:29.370 --> 40:31.000
we can do that.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.480
We started a sewing circle
at the community center,

40:33.680 --> 40:34.910
and the drama in the over-70 set

40:35.110 --> 40:37.470
is real.
[chuckles]

40:41.480 --> 40:44.270
The end was pretty sudden,

40:44.470 --> 40:47.010
but, um, looking back,

40:47.210 --> 40:49.140
Bonnie and I haven't been good
for a while.

40:50.750 --> 40:53.150
I didn't know how
to tell anyone, or

40:53.350 --> 40:55.760
maybe I didn't want to 'cause

40:55.960 --> 40:57.680
if I didn't say anything,

40:57.880 --> 40:59.500
I didn't have to admit
that I failed.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.160
Oh, Tan, honey.Hey, hey, listen to me,

41:01.360 --> 41:03.470
you did not fail.

41:03.660 --> 41:05.990
Okay, but, um, I'm not
supposed to be like this.

41:06.190 --> 41:09.250
I'm not the person that you
got to worry about.

41:09.450 --> 41:11.520
My-my dad got sick,

41:11.720 --> 41:14.080
I-I'm the brother
who stuck around.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.520
When-when Buck left
and Street came,

41:16.720 --> 41:18.440
and everything
was chaos,

41:18.640 --> 41:20.220
I'm the person no one
had to check in on.

41:20.420 --> 41:23.400
I-I handle things.
I-I have it together.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.100
Okay, I need you
to understand something.

41:25.290 --> 41:27.660
No one expects you
to be perfect.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.450
Okay, we take our turns
falling apart,

41:29.650 --> 41:31.670
but then we
lean on each other

41:31.870 --> 41:34.890
when our own road
gets tough, that's it.

41:35.090 --> 41:36.670
I can do that.

41:36.870 --> 41:38.850
Just...

41:39.050 --> 41:41.200
Maybe starting with some
of that spaghetti?

41:41.400 --> 41:43.630
[both chuckle]I thought you'd never ask.

41:46.930 --> 41:49.340
You are my team, Tan.

41:49.540 --> 41:51.240
That means
you're family.

41:52.900 --> 41:54.860
I don't want you
to ever feel alone,

41:55.060 --> 41:56.910
all right?

41:57.110 --> 42:00.390
Come on.
Let's get some grub.
