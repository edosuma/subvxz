00:07.439 --> 00:08.440
Uh...

00:09.400 --> 00:11.400
- Can I get you a drink?
- Sure.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.760
- Uh...
- Where's all your furniture?

00:13.760 --> 00:16.200
Um, I haven't been here that long.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.439
My ex-wife still lives in the family home,
so I don't have much stuff.

00:20.439 --> 00:23.959
We've been separated
for almost a year now.

00:23.959 --> 00:27.160
It's, um... it's been quite an adjustment.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.400
Michael, I don't really wanna
talk about your ex-wife.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.640
Sorry. Yeah.

00:34.559 --> 00:36.640
Why don't we drink afterwards?

00:37.559 --> 00:38.600
After what?

00:42.919 --> 00:43.840
Ah! Oh! Uh...

00:43.840 --> 00:45.400
Uh... uh... Oh. Ooh!

00:45.400 --> 00:46.680
Mmph! Oh... Mmm!

00:46.680 --> 00:49.440
Ah! Uh... Oh...

00:49.440 --> 00:50.360
Uh. Ah!

00:50.360 --> 00:51.559
Oh! Ow!

00:51.559 --> 00:52.840
Ah!

00:52.840 --> 00:55.000
- Ah! Oh! Ah!
- Ah! Oh!

00:55.000 --> 00:57.080
Oh, yes. Oh, that's it!

00:57.760 --> 00:59.000
Ah! Ah!

00:59.000 --> 00:59.919
Oh, hang on.

00:59.919 --> 01:00.879
Oh. Oh.

01:00.879 --> 01:04.000
Sorry. Ah! Sorry.
Sorry. I just need a moment. Um...

01:04.920 --> 01:07.840
Sometimes I have trouble
performing at the drop of a hat.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.479
Do you have any little blue pills?

01:09.479 --> 01:13.960
Uh... no. But I did try one once
when my ex-wife--

01:13.960 --> 01:14.880
Michael.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.440
I don't wanna think about you

01:16.440 --> 01:18.240
- and your ex-wife right now.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.160
- Come on. You can do this.
- Uh-huh.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.320
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

01:23.320 --> 01:25.320
Mm-hmm.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.479
Okay, yeah.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.680
Come on. Come on.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.240
Oh, that's... Oh!

01:31.240 --> 01:32.440
- Come on!
- I can't.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.600
Come on!

01:35.360 --> 01:36.759
Ah!

01:36.759 --> 01:38.720

01:47.759 --> 01:50.199
Or we could just
have a nice cuddle instead.

01:50.199 --> 01:54.000
Thank you for dinner, Michael,
but I need a proper man in the bedroom.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.600
- Someone who wants to rip my clothes off.
- Ah!

01:58.240 --> 02:00.240

Elsie, can you take
Maeve's bag to the car?

02:56.720 --> 02:57.720
Oh, thank you.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.560

Uh, had a chat with your mum, um...

Yeah?

04:03.519 --> 04:06.399
If you want to stay home, you can.

04:06.399 --> 04:10.519
No. I want to go to college.
There's no point worrying about it.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.239
- Jackson.
- Yeah.

04:13.799 --> 04:14.799
Look at me.

04:14.799 --> 04:16.079
It's gonna be okay.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.920
Yeah, I know.

04:17.920 --> 04:18.880
Love you.

04:38.599 --> 04:40.960
I'm your host, Dr. Jean Milburn.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.120
This is your host.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.440
I'm your host, Dr. Jean Milburn,

04:46.080 --> 04:50.160
and I wanted to start today
by talking about male mental health.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.599
Caffeine delivery!

04:51.599 --> 04:53.640
- Sh! I just got her to settle.
- Oh shit. Sorry.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.160
- Thank you.
- There we go.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.039
Oh.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.479
Ooh!

05:00.880 --> 05:02.360
- Mmph.
- So, Jo.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.400
- Mmm?
- Uh...

05:03.400 --> 05:06.520
I've been asked to come in early
to the station this afternoon.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.360
- Would you watch Joy?
- I can't.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.280
Why?

05:09.280 --> 05:12.680
I have got a date
with this guy that I met at the bank.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.240
Oh my God.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.840
What?

05:16.400 --> 05:20.280
Well, I don't know. Just maybe don't do
the thing that you always do?

05:20.280 --> 05:22.680
Just jump into another relationship.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.400
- Mmm.
- Take a breath. Huh?

05:25.400 --> 05:26.560
You can talk.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.880
- I'm just saying.
- Do you know, I... I really...

05:28.880 --> 05:31.680
I don't need you to do
the whole mothering thing right now.

05:31.680 --> 05:32.720
- It's just a date.
- Sh.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.640
Okay.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.240
- Can you not take Joy with you?
- No, I can't.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.800
I'm afraid they're gonna fire me today.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.160
What?

05:40.160 --> 05:42.520
I don't know.
The show hasn't been going very well.

05:43.039 --> 05:45.840
It's been quite bad, actually.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.039
And I just... I can't find my rhythm.

05:48.039 --> 05:52.280
And I just should never have taken the job
in the first place.

05:55.479 --> 05:57.160
Fine. It's fine.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.599
- It's okay.
- No, fine. I can rearrange my date.

05:59.599 --> 06:00.520
No.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.520
If you can do something for me?

06:05.520 --> 06:07.720
I need you to lie really still.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.840
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm going to fart on your head.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.160
- It'll be a squelchy one.
- Jo!

06:11.160 --> 06:13.240
I'm heading out.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.640
- Nice.
- Sorry, I was farting on your mum's head.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.880
Maeve's back, but her mum's in hospital.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.320
What about college, darling?

06:21.320 --> 06:23.919
Well, it's just a day.
Mum, she really needs me.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.680
- Have fun.
- Well, call me later.

06:29.160 --> 06:31.359
- Oh.
- That was definitely his fault, not mine.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.120
My Joy! Hey, baby! Hey!

06:50.120 --> 06:51.120
Who is that?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.440
Uh, it's Jem. Dad owns the place.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.039
Very pretty.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.039
Is she? Uh... didn't notice.

07:00.039 --> 07:02.039
Um... I don't need a lift.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.400
- Dad's gonna give me another lesson.
- Oh, good.

07:06.520 --> 07:11.120
Oh, um... I was gonna ask.
Uh, did your dad ever go on that date?

07:11.120 --> 07:13.239
No, I don't know. Why do you care?

07:13.919 --> 07:15.320
Uh I... I don't care.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.120
I mean, I'm just, um... just, uh...

07:18.120 --> 07:21.080
really happy for him
that he's moving on, that's all.

07:24.719 --> 07:26.479
- Have a lovely day.
- Mm-hmm.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.039
Can you meet me in the riding pen
after lunch, okay?

07:45.080 --> 07:46.680
Hmm.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.159
When I met you, I was but the learner.

07:58.159 --> 08:00.679
Now I am the master.

08:11.159 --> 08:12.599
Can you get that?

08:17.560 --> 08:19.560
My God, Jean!

08:19.560 --> 08:22.640
- Oh!
- No, I'm... I'm Joanna.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.760
I'm Jean's sister.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.400
- Oh!
- Actually, I've just got this thing.

08:25.400 --> 08:30.280
It's supposed to, like, boost my collagen
and make me look 17 years old again.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.799
I hope it works,
'cause it was really fucking expensive.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.799
Oh my God! Sounds fabulous.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.400
Sorry, who are you?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.280
- Oh, I'm... I'm Eric.
- Right.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.240
- Uh, I'm Otis's friend. Is he here?
- Oh. Uh, no, he isn't.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.800
Somebody called "Mavis" has just got back,
so he's gone to see her.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.640
Huh.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.440
Okay.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.040
- Shall I pass on a message? Or...
- Uh, no. No, no.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.959
- Um, nice to meet you, Joanna.
- You too, Eric.

08:55.959 --> 08:58.800
- Good luck with the collagen.
- Thank you. I really need it.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.840
Thank you for letting me know, Otis!

09:36.560 --> 09:38.640
Maeve, Aimee's here.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.440
- Oh.
- Aimes, I missed you.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.280
Thanks for giving me a lift.

09:48.760 --> 09:49.959
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.480
- Oh, is Otis comin'?
- No.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.199
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.560
What are you doing here?

09:59.240 --> 10:01.720
I just thought I'd come
and give you some support.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.000
Sorry, have I done the wrong thing?

10:05.560 --> 10:09.240
Uh... No, no. That's... that's really nice...
that's really nice of you.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.400
It's just I haven't showered
since the plane.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.480
I was hoping to see you
a bit more spruced up, but I'm not--

10:14.480 --> 10:15.800
That's okay. I'm...

10:16.760 --> 10:18.839
It's fine. I can come back. Don't worry.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.839
Nice to see you.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.680
Don't go, actually. Please.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.040
- I've missed you.
- I missed you.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.480
- Ow!
- Sorry.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.440
Carry it 'cause my feet get dead
sweaty when I drive. Knock yourself out.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.040
Hop in.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.120
Fresh blossom?

10:44.160 --> 10:45.199
Fuckin' hell.

11:13.959 --> 11:14.920
What?

11:20.320 --> 11:21.839
Disgustin'.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.280
- We texted all weekend.
- Aw!

11:34.280 --> 11:36.959
- I think I really like him.
- See, I told you.

11:37.719 --> 11:39.800
He's like your nerdy soulmate.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.480
He even told his dad about me.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.240
They're like best mates.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.520
How sweet is that?

11:44.520 --> 11:45.760
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

11:45.760 --> 11:47.480
What? What?

11:47.480 --> 11:48.560
Nothin'.

11:49.680 --> 11:54.040
Viv, you have a bad case of mention-itis.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.760
- You can't stop talkin' about him.
- Stop!

11:55.760 --> 11:58.240
- Okay, I'll stop.
- No, no, look, I'm happy for you.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.280
I am.

12:03.199 --> 12:04.240
Hey, um...

12:06.360 --> 12:10.079
I do need to talk to you about something.
It's a bit awkward. I found a lump.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.640
Like, in my ball sack.

12:13.719 --> 12:15.000
What do you mean? Are you okay?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.680
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

12:18.600 --> 12:19.520
No.

12:20.560 --> 12:23.199
Freakin' out. But they're doin' tests, so...

12:24.360 --> 12:26.520
I wanted to let you know,
you're my best friend.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.120
Okay, well, um...

12:29.440 --> 12:32.760
Thank you for letting me know.
I'm here for you.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.520
Thanks.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.000
Come on.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.560
His video was so relatable.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.280
O's video was too shiny.
I feel like we never really know her.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.480
Yeah, that's crazy.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.160
I'm just, like, really itchy.
I don't know what happened.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.000
Excuse me. No queue-jumping.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.599
Chill. I'm looking for Otis.
I'm his campaign manager.

13:14.599 --> 13:16.880
If you're his campaign manager,
then where is he?

13:16.880 --> 13:19.640
Let me get back to you on that.

13:33.959 --> 13:36.839
- I also have some free T-shirts.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.120
For you. And there's one for you.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.880
- And you.
- Thank you. These are so soft!

14:03.480 --> 14:05.240
There's my dickhead brother.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.880
Do you want us to come in with you?

14:08.440 --> 14:09.760
No, it's fine.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.120
- You sure?
- Yeah. I won't be long.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.640
I hope she's all right.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.920
I know. Me too.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.079
Do you know how to play Scabby Queen?

14:30.079 --> 14:32.120
Hey, Froggy! Ribbit!

14:34.040 --> 14:36.040
Ah!

14:39.839 --> 14:42.520
- Where have you been?
- Oh, just with my mate, um... Mo.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.640
- You know, Mo. He's got...
- No.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.199
I can't believe you've come back
from America for this.

14:47.199 --> 14:49.599
- She'd better be really ill this time.
- Sean.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.680
Do you not remember
last time she ended up in hospital?

14:53.199 --> 14:56.599
She escaped. By the time they caught her,
she was by the train station.

14:56.599 --> 14:59.479
Yeah? In nothing but a hospital gown
with her arse hangin' out.

14:59.479 --> 15:00.439
Wasn't funny.

15:00.439 --> 15:03.000
- Come on. It was a little bit funny.
- I'm not laughing.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.400
Don't let you laugh in America,
do they?

15:09.400 --> 15:12.079
Hey, um... can I walk you to class?

15:12.079 --> 15:13.560
- Ready? Smile!
- Yeah.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.640
Yeah, um... I just wanted to ask

15:15.640 --> 15:19.280
if there's anything goin' on
with you and that Jackson guy?

15:19.800 --> 15:22.240
Because you guys were huggin' earlier,
and I, um...

15:22.839 --> 15:26.560
I... I don't wanna get my hopes up if you're
already involved with someone else.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.040
No. Um...

15:28.839 --> 15:31.959
Jackson's my best mate.
He's going through some personal stuff.

15:31.959 --> 15:34.760
But there is definitely nothing
going on between us.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.360
Okay. Okay, cool.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.680
Okay. I'm... I'm sorry.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.439
I'm sorry. I just...
I get in my head sometimes, and...

15:41.479 --> 15:42.680
I... I really like you.

15:42.680 --> 15:46.280
Uh, um... I know this is fast,
but I've been thinking, actually.

15:46.280 --> 15:49.599
If you wanted to,
do you wanna be my girlfriend?

15:50.280 --> 15:53.719
- If you want. I don't--
- I would love to be your girlfriend.

15:54.920 --> 15:55.760
Okay. Cool.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.199
- Cool.
- Yeah.

15:57.199 --> 15:59.160
- Cool. Shall we--
- Class?

15:59.160 --> 16:01.479
- Class. Yeah.
- Class. Yes. Probably should.

16:01.479 --> 16:03.920
Yeah. There's this statistics book
I'm really enjoying.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.640
- The way it analyzes data...
- Oh, yeah, did you finish the--

16:06.640 --> 16:10.920
Oh no. You have to try it.
It's so invigorating.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.000
- I didn't exfoliate for a week.
- See you!

16:15.000 --> 16:16.640
- Hey.
- Hi, miss.

16:21.479 --> 16:24.079
Yeah, just an idea.
Um, homage to my phone.

16:24.079 --> 16:25.439
It's gonna...

16:31.400 --> 16:32.760
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.000
I'm sorry about the other night.
I was so awkward.

16:36.599 --> 16:37.959
No, you weren't.

16:37.959 --> 16:40.599
People think
I want to kiss them all the time.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.520
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

16:43.199 --> 16:44.479
Just a little bit.

16:48.240 --> 16:54.400
Um... I wanted to explain.
PK and I are ethically non-monogamous.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.240
So, I was wondering

16:57.240 --> 17:00.760
if you might wanna go
on a date sometime with me?

17:00.760 --> 17:02.079
Um...

17:03.319 --> 17:06.000
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Yeah!

17:29.640 --> 17:30.880
Hmm...

17:31.399 --> 17:33.000
- Boom.
- Mm-hmm.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.040
Heh-heh-heh.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.240
Pause.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.399
Ahem.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.960
- Everythin' all right?
- Yeah, it's just Isaac.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.520
- I didn't know you were friends.
- We're not. I just do art class with him.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.000
- It's not like I like him or anythin'.
- Okay. Sure.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.960
Not everything's therapy, Otis.

18:00.760 --> 18:03.360
- You're the Scabby Queen.
- You're like a mind reader.

18:06.840 --> 18:07.840
What shall we do now?

18:10.880 --> 18:12.000
Can I take your photo?

18:12.919 --> 18:13.840
Sure.

18:16.880 --> 18:17.840
That's a nice camera.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.600
Right. Oh God. It gets me every time.

18:56.399 --> 18:58.720
- What?
- It's not an appropriate place to whistle.

19:08.800 --> 19:09.760
Sean.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.280
Sorry.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.240
- Sorry.
- Maeve and Sean Wiley?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.280
Come with me.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.760
If you'd like to come through.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.560
Where's my mum?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.840
Take a seat,
and we can have a chat.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.000
I don't wanna sit.
What are you doing? Get up.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.560
- Sean. Sit down. Sit down.
- Loser, get up. Get up.

20:09.360 --> 20:13.080
I am very sorry to inform you
that your mother has passed away.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.720
Shortly after she was admitted to ICU,

20:18.720 --> 20:21.919
she lost consciousness
and fell into a coma.

20:21.919 --> 20:24.679
It was very unexpected...

20:25.919 --> 20:28.600
Whilst she was initially stable,
she deteriorated quickly,

20:28.600 --> 20:30.480
and her heart stopped working.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.080
We did everything to try and save her,
but I'm afraid we were unsuccessful.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.440
We lost her about 20 minutes ago.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.360
I'm so sorry for your loss.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.880
Take as much time as you need.
This room is for you.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.520
A nurse will be in to see you shortly.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.800
Oh!

21:02.960 --> 21:04.679
- Hi. Hello.
- <i>Hola.</i>

21:04.679 --> 21:06.880
- That's a baby.
- Oh, yeah. No, she's not mine.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.360
- Oh.
- No, she's my niece.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.880
- I couldn't get out of watching her, so...
- Oh.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.040
- Hi. Hello.
- Uh, mange-tout.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.880
- Well, this--
- Mmm!

21:14.880 --> 21:17.679
Maybe I'll just pop another one there
for good luck.

21:17.679 --> 21:19.240
Wow, you smell really...

21:20.000 --> 21:21.960
...fucking nice, actually.
Thanks very much!

21:21.960 --> 21:24.159
Came over here
on my "motorbee-kay."

21:24.159 --> 21:26.919
Wow, a bike. That's, um...

21:27.679 --> 21:29.360
- Oh no.
- It's fine.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.440
Sorry.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.480
Oh, she's been fussing all morning.

21:32.480 --> 21:36.720
I thought I could leave her at home,
but my... my sister had to work, so, uh...

21:36.720 --> 21:39.800
Yeah, I should probably feed her.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.440
- Sorry.
- No, don't apologize.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.960
Go ahead. I, uh... love babies.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.399
- They're, uh, you know... cool.
- Yeah, I'm sure you do.

21:45.399 --> 21:46.919
I do. They're great stuff.

21:46.919 --> 21:48.960
I'm the eldest of, uh, six siblings.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.600
- Oh right?
- Would you believe?

21:50.600 --> 21:53.760
I was around them a lot. My little brother
Billy called me "Daddy Brother."

21:53.760 --> 21:55.080
- Uh-huh.
- Not in a creepy...

21:55.080 --> 21:57.200
- We weren't in a cult. I promise.
- Right.

21:57.200 --> 22:01.480
Just a normal family.
My parents just... loved bangin', I guess.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.000
Hey! Hi there.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.800
Who are you?
You're a handsome little devil.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.159
Oh, she likes you.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.520
So, what about you?
Do you wanna get married?

22:09.520 --> 22:10.800
Pop out some babies? Pop!

22:10.800 --> 22:12.800
Wow! Right to the point.

22:12.800 --> 22:16.200
Sorry. You know what it is?
I just... I go on so many dates.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.640
Honestly, I just wanna settle down,

22:17.640 --> 22:21.200
but most of the women I... I go out with,
they're only interested in, you know...

22:21.200 --> 22:22.320
Mm-hmm.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.600
So I'm... I'm trying out this new thing
where I'm just really honest

22:25.600 --> 22:27.000
so I don't waste people's time.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.399
Yeah, I, uh...
I wanna settle down too.

22:30.399 --> 22:33.960
But I just can't seem
to make anything long-term stick.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.320
You know, it's just, like,
the wrong person.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.919
- Right.
- Or, like, you know, the wrong time.

22:38.919 --> 22:40.600
And there's always that risk

22:40.600 --> 22:44.040
of, like, passing down all of
your dysfunctional shit to an infant.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.320
Not that I've got loads of it.
Just a normal amount.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.040
Right, sure. Like, a normal amount
of dysfunctional shit.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.240
Yeah, that was probably the wrong answer.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.800
It wasn't at all. It really...
It really wasn't.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.600
If you're happy to wait until tomorrow
to see Otis,

23:06.600 --> 23:09.360
he will give you a double appointment
and a regular slot.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.159
I only wanna stop my muff itching.

23:11.159 --> 23:14.040
Any time, that's what I'm here for.
Don't forget to vote for O.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.760
- Bye. Thanks so much.
- Thanks.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.960
Can I help you?

23:16.960 --> 23:18.080
Yes, you can.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.399
You can stop taking Otis's clients.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.919
<i>There will be a student counselor
debate this Thursday lunchtime.</i>

23:23.919 --> 23:27.640
<i>Come and hear Otis and O make the case
for why they deserve your vote.</i>

23:27.640 --> 23:29.720
<i>We'll have free tote bags
for anyone who comes along.</i>

23:29.720 --> 23:31.120
What's this about a debate?

23:31.120 --> 23:33.439
I'm so sorry. Who are you again?

23:33.439 --> 23:36.320
Oh, please stop pretending
that you don't know who I am.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.679
- Why don't we step inside?
- Yeah, shall we?

23:44.240 --> 23:45.280
Take a wee seat.

23:46.159 --> 23:48.880
No, thank you.
I don't want to crease my skirt.

23:52.439 --> 23:55.000
So, what's with this debate?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.679
Oh, uh... I just thought
it might be a good opportunity

23:57.679 --> 23:59.600
for Otis and I to get our points across.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.120
- I was gonna tell him if it got approved.
- I bet you were.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.280
What's your connection to Otis?

24:06.280 --> 24:07.800
Why does that matter?

24:08.800 --> 24:11.200
Just tryin' to work out
what's in this for you.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.880
I mean, you must be pretty good friends
to help him like this.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.080
Yes, we're friends.

24:18.159 --> 24:20.480
But you used to be more?

24:20.480 --> 24:22.280
We dated briefly.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.720
I broke up with him, obviously.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.640
Because his feelings
weren't as strong as yours?

24:27.640 --> 24:30.200
And he still held a torch for that girl?

24:30.200 --> 24:33.720
Oh, what's her name,
the one he's with now, the one in America?

24:34.679 --> 24:35.919
Maeve, is it?

24:36.439 --> 24:37.640
I'm just guessing here.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.560
I don't know, but it would explain
why you're runnin' round after him.

24:41.560 --> 24:45.320
You're hoping
that one day he will see the light

24:46.280 --> 24:50.679
and realize that you're the person
who's always known how special he is,

24:50.679 --> 24:54.679
and he'll say that he loves you
as much as you've always loved him.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.280
That's not true.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.840
Okay.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.640
But I'll give you some advice.

25:06.640 --> 25:11.520
If someone really truly likes you,
they shouldn't be playin' any games.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.560
They shouldn't be leaving you confused.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.240
It'll be clear.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.159
Thank you for the advice.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.360
Now, let me give you some.

25:26.880 --> 25:28.880
Start preparing yourself to lose.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.439
When we were ten,
you decided to make my life a living hell.

25:31.439 --> 25:35.560
And now, I promise you, I plan on
doing the exact same thing to you.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.760
- Was that a threat?
- No, it's a promise, Sarah.

25:39.679 --> 25:42.320
Now, I've got a debate to prepare for.

25:44.199 --> 25:46.040
My name is O.

25:47.399 --> 25:50.159
- Shall I look at you?
- Whatever you want.

25:50.159 --> 25:51.360
Shall I--

25:52.199 --> 25:54.000
Just, kind of, you know, relax.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.240
What's that?

26:00.080 --> 26:03.240
Uh... Sorry. I was just...
I was... I was trying to pose.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.720
Maybe just do nothing.

26:06.360 --> 26:07.280
Ahem. Okay.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.439
I feel like you're still doing something.

26:22.360 --> 26:23.439
Weird.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.240
Oh, okay.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.000
- Not bad.
- Thanks.

26:27.000 --> 26:27.919
Weird.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.240
Are these going in your portfolio?

26:31.240 --> 26:32.919
No, no, no. I'm just practicin'.

26:33.439 --> 26:35.679
I actually think
I wanna take photos of myself.

26:35.679 --> 26:38.159
Isaac showed me these
amazing self-portraits I really like.

26:38.159 --> 26:40.000
I thought you weren't friends with Isaac?

26:40.960 --> 26:41.840
Yeah, I'm not.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.360
Yeah, I don't really know
what I'm trying to say yet

26:46.360 --> 26:48.880
with the self-portraits,
which is annoying.

26:49.399 --> 26:52.880
Like, say with Isaac's work, for example.
It really means something.

26:55.280 --> 26:59.040
Maybe you're thinking about it too much.
Just trust your instincts.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.720
That is exactly what Isaac says.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.480
Otis, will you therapy me?

27:09.800 --> 27:11.360
Uh, what's up?

27:13.040 --> 27:14.480
Right. Um...

27:15.120 --> 27:16.040
Say...

27:17.280 --> 27:20.720
if you thought
you were getting feelings for someone

27:20.720 --> 27:23.480
who your best friend
used to have a thing with,

27:24.080 --> 27:26.640
do you think you would
have to tell your best friend

27:26.640 --> 27:31.040
you were getting feelings for the person
that they used to have the thing with?

27:35.520 --> 27:36.439
I think...

27:37.520 --> 27:41.480
I think if these feelings are real,
and you wanna act on them, then...

27:42.520 --> 27:44.600
yeah, you should be upfront
with your friend.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.320
- Mmm.
- If you don't tell them and they find out,

27:52.399 --> 27:53.640
it'll be a lot worse.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.320
Yeah.

28:00.159 --> 28:02.240
I wasn't talking about Isaac, by the way.

28:03.679 --> 28:05.880
- Didn't think you were.
- That's good. Hold that.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.159
Ahem...

28:08.000 --> 28:11.399
- You changed it again.
- I'm sorry. I did. I know I did.

28:15.640 --> 28:18.560
Hi. I'm doing a survey
for the student counselor election.

28:18.560 --> 28:22.840
Do you feel that O has ever crossed a line
or treated anyone badly?

28:22.840 --> 28:24.840
- No.
- Okay.

28:26.840 --> 28:30.480
Has O's behavior ever been
not inclusive or mean?

28:30.480 --> 28:32.040
- No.
- No.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.919
- No.
- No, not at all.

28:33.919 --> 28:37.240
Has O ever given you advice
that was damaging or incorrect?

28:37.240 --> 28:38.919
- No.
- No.

28:38.919 --> 28:40.679
No. No. No. No.

28:40.679 --> 28:42.439
- No!
- Okay.

28:51.919 --> 28:55.840
In terms of a charity, we should raise
for something different this year.

28:55.840 --> 28:59.600
Hi. I'm doing a survey
for the student counselor election.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.080
- Can I ask a few questions?
- We are in the middle of a meeting.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.320
It'll just take a sec.

29:03.320 --> 29:08.560
So, do you feel that O has ever
crossed the line or treated anyone badly?

29:09.199 --> 29:12.199
Um... No. She's actually helped me out
with a lot of problems.

29:12.199 --> 29:13.520
We think she's great.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.080
Sorry. I didn't catch what you said.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.040
Don't worry, babe. I'll tell you later.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.040
Uh, do you have any more questions?

29:20.040 --> 29:26.080
Yeah. Do you feel that O's behavior
has ever been not inclusive or mean?

29:26.679 --> 29:29.399
- Um... last--
- Look, this is feeling quite bitchy now.

29:29.399 --> 29:31.480
Oh, come on.

29:31.480 --> 29:35.639
I know you don't really buy into the whole
not-talking-behind-people's-back thing

29:35.639 --> 29:38.560
and that, like, being kind is,
you know, your brand.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.639
Love it.

29:39.639 --> 29:42.919
But, uh, I'm not gonna tell anyone.
You can give me the goss.

29:42.919 --> 29:45.560
Being kind isn't a brand.
It's the right thing to do.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.840
Um... we actually do need
to get on with our meetin',

29:48.840 --> 29:50.199
but good luck with your survey.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.679
That girl's energy
is so emotionally draining.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.080
Aisha, that's not gossip. It's a fact.

30:09.399 --> 30:10.760
Ooh! Eric.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.000
Have you seen Otis?
Because he's ignoring my texts.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.520
Uh, no. No, he stood me up this mornin'.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.879
Because you disinvited him
from the club night thing?

30:19.879 --> 30:22.600
- Excuse me?
- No, I'm not judging you, Eric.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.800
Believe me. I disinvite uncool people
from things all the time.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.679
It's just I think he was a bit upset.

30:27.679 --> 30:32.080
Oh my God! No.
No, it's because Maeve is back in town.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.000
And whenever she's around,
nothin' else matters to him.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.240
He's not told you that she's back?

30:39.240 --> 30:40.520
Oh, I'm...

30:41.360 --> 30:43.280
- No, it's fine. Yes.
- Did... Yeah?

30:43.280 --> 30:46.879
- Okay, good. Yes, thank you. Thanks.
- Because I-- Good, yeah. Yeah, okay.

30:59.439 --> 31:00.720
What did I miss?

31:01.399 --> 31:02.240
Ruby.

31:04.439 --> 31:05.280
Of course.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.240
We still need to choose
a charity for the fundraiser.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.560
Do we have any ideas?

31:11.959 --> 31:13.760
Up. No. Keep going.

31:23.679 --> 31:27.040
So, what's going through your head
when you look at Midnight?

31:27.040 --> 31:28.360
Uh...

31:29.480 --> 31:33.320
"If I fall over, you will crush me
with your small metal feet."

31:34.959 --> 31:36.439
Right. Well, take the reins.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.840
You need to let the horse know
you're not afraid.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.080
Come on. We're gonna walk together.
Come on.

31:46.199 --> 31:47.639
Give her a tug. Come on.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.919
Try and... tune into the horse's rhythm.

31:57.840 --> 31:58.760
Okay.

32:01.439 --> 32:02.280
See.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.480
He's not that scary, is he?

32:07.399 --> 32:09.040
Okay, let's get you on.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.199
- Don't I need another lesson?
- Well, you know the old saying.

32:12.199 --> 32:15.159
"Thinking doesn't overcome fear.
Action does." Up.

32:19.719 --> 32:22.159
Ready? Shall I help you?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.199
Okay. One, two, three.

32:26.199 --> 32:27.280
- Ah.
- Okay.

32:28.639 --> 32:29.879
- You good?
- Uh-huh.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.040
- Go on.
- Oof! Okay.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.480
- Slowly, though.
- All right.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.439
- You've got it.
- Slow it down.

32:36.360 --> 32:37.520
- Slowly.
- Okay.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.600
There we go, boy.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.600
That's it. Good boy.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.120
Okay. Ready?

32:45.120 --> 32:48.120
- You're gonna trot now. Come on.
- No. I think I should get down.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.639
Oh my! Oh! Hey.

32:50.639 --> 32:54.040
Ah! Hey! Oh! My balls! My balls!

32:55.080 --> 32:57.399
- Just tune into his rhythm.
- I'm riding. Okay.

32:57.919 --> 33:00.240
Okay, there you go.
You're actually cantering.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.080
- Okay? Yes!
- Okay.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.520
I'm riding. I'm riding a horse.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.639
Yes, you are.

33:10.800 --> 33:14.399
We're moving your mother to the mortuary.
You'll be able to see her soon.

33:14.399 --> 33:16.520
Here are her belongings.

33:19.919 --> 33:22.320
Do you think it's weird
if I finish the sweets?

33:23.320 --> 33:25.399
She's hardly gonna need them now, is she?

33:28.800 --> 33:30.360
Can no one take a joke anymore?

33:31.159 --> 33:33.159
Do you remember when Uncle Pat died?

33:33.679 --> 33:34.600
Um...

33:34.600 --> 33:37.879
Yeah, kinda. His funeral
was the first time I had beer.

33:37.879 --> 33:39.879
- You were eight.
- Yeah.

33:39.879 --> 33:43.639
Uncle Pat's girlfriend gave it to me.
Now she could take a joke. Remember?

33:48.480 --> 33:50.879
I remember seeing him dead.
He didn't look like himself.

33:50.879 --> 33:54.439
After that, I couldn't remember
what alive Uncle Pat looked like.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.320
I don't think I can see Mum like that.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.000
If that's okay.

34:03.639 --> 34:04.480
Yeah.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.159
All right.

34:15.839 --> 34:17.639
Celia?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.040
Sorry. I'll come back.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.159
No. No, no, no, no.
I'm awake. Power napping.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.319
Okay.

34:23.319 --> 34:24.799
Power napping. Come in.

34:26.319 --> 34:29.199
Come in. Sit down.
Sit down, sit down. Sit down.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.760
How about you turn around, bright eyes?

34:38.880 --> 34:41.400
- I'm not moving. This is me for a bit.
- Oh, okay.

34:42.120 --> 34:43.080
Okay.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.520
We need to talk about your last few shows.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.280
- Yes.
- They have not been great.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.040
I know they haven't been very good.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.440
And, um, I am just finding my feet,

34:52.440 --> 34:55.799
but I've done some extra prep,
and I think I've found a way in.

34:55.799 --> 34:58.080
Probably a little bit late for that.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.520
I'm afraid the big boss, Terry,
is a bit worried about the format.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.080
He thinks it's flat.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.120
So what I have done is...

35:06.120 --> 35:11.280
I've found some guests who are going to
come and cohost with you this week, okay?

35:11.280 --> 35:15.680
- Right. What... what kind of guests?
- You know, sex people like yourself.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.560
I've got one woman who makes plaster casts

35:18.560 --> 35:20.160
out of her own vagina.

35:20.160 --> 35:24.080
Um, look.
I... I know that I haven't been on form,

35:24.080 --> 35:29.760
but I would really like the chance to
be able to work out how to do it myself.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.160
I'm really sorry, Jean.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.880
If it was up to me, absolutely.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.000
I'm under a lot of pressure
to make this work.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.360
It could loosen things up.
Could make it fun.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.600
You know, this could be a good thing.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.280
- Hello!
- Oh. O!

35:43.280 --> 35:46.200
That's her name, not an exclamation.
Come on in.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.160
- O, this is Jean. O.
- Oh.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.080
O... Jean, hi.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.640
- O. Co-host.
- Uh...

35:52.560 --> 35:53.960
Yeah. Oh, O-host!

35:53.960 --> 35:57.600
You should, uh... check out her channel.
The videos are great.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.440
Good. No. Remember to indicate.

36:03.960 --> 36:04.920
Round there.

36:07.960 --> 36:11.520
And... All right.
Now let's try a parallel park.

36:15.080 --> 36:17.640
How did your date go
with the, uh... teacher?

36:18.160 --> 36:20.480
Uh... it, uh, wasn't the best.

36:21.799 --> 36:22.960
What did you do?

36:22.960 --> 36:25.640
Well, it's more what I didn't do.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.520
- Did you let her pay for dinner?
- No.

36:27.520 --> 36:32.200
I, uh... struggle, you know, sometimes
to get it going in the penile department.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.000
- Careful!
- Oh my God!

36:34.000 --> 36:36.440
Why did you tell me that?

36:36.440 --> 36:38.799
Oh, the images. Jesus Christ!

36:38.799 --> 36:43.160
- Sorry. I thought we tell stuff now.
- Not that! Never that.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.400
- I thought you took Viagra.
- I do. It...

36:46.240 --> 36:49.200
- Hang on. How did you know?
- We're not talking about that.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.600
I'll go in.
We'll never talk about this again.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.960
Good lesson. Sorry for oversharing.
Won't happen again.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.319
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.120
I... I think you've got performance anxiety.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.960
Thinking doesn't overcome fear.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.160
Action does.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.080
And never take more than one Viagra.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.600
Your penis will explode.

37:34.600 --> 37:39.480
Gloria, it's Michael. I've got the little
blue pills, and I'm feeling manly.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.520
Well, it's definitely Mum.

38:05.640 --> 38:08.520
And she's definitely... dead.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.799
They said that we can go.

38:14.480 --> 38:16.080
I wanna finish my crossword.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.040
It's just, uh... Mo is giving me a lift.

38:27.280 --> 38:31.120
- And I kinda wanna get out of here.
- Mmm. It's okay. You can go. I'm fine.

38:32.520 --> 38:33.839
Okay. Uh...

38:34.720 --> 38:38.160
- What do you want me to tell your mates?
- Tell them I'll be out in a bit.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.080
Okay. Uh...

38:44.440 --> 38:46.400
- Call me if you need anything.
- Mm-hmm.

Oh, uh... I'm so sorry.

Oh, maybe it'll come back.

40:05.680 --> 40:06.600
Uh...

40:06.600 --> 40:10.280
Yeah, uh... I gotta pick up my daughter
from choir practice soon.

40:11.799 --> 40:13.040
Uh...

40:13.040 --> 40:14.880
Oh... Uh...

40:24.400 --> 40:29.240
<i>Hi there.
This is your host, Dr. Jean Milburn.</i>

40:29.240 --> 40:32.640
- I love your mum.
- <i>And joining me on</i> Sexology <i>tonight</i>

40:32.640 --> 40:37.160
<i>is a brilliant young sex educator
and influencer, O.</i>

40:37.160 --> 40:39.799
<i>Wow, thank you so much.
That was a very warm welcome.</i>

40:39.799 --> 40:42.200
- No... No!
<i>- And quite a compliment from yourself!</i>

40:42.200 --> 40:45.160
<i>I am so happy to be here.
I can't articulate that enough.</i>

40:45.160 --> 40:47.680
<i>And I can't wait
to take some of these calls together.</i>

40:48.640 --> 40:49.640
- Otis.
- <i>I mean...</i>

40:49.640 --> 40:52.440
<i>I don't know about yourself,
but working out...</i>

40:54.080 --> 40:55.880
- Hi.
- Hi. Um...

40:56.920 --> 41:00.720
I'm gonna head off,
uh, but Maeve's still in there.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.520
She's just finishing her crossword.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.839
Okay. Is everythin' all right?

41:06.319 --> 41:07.400
No, not really.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.240
My mum died.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.200
Fuck.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.240
Oh my God, Sean. I'm so sorry.

41:13.839 --> 41:15.240
Should we go and get Maeve?

41:15.240 --> 41:16.400
Um...

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
I wouldn't.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.240
I'd just let her do her thing.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.720
Do you wanna sit with us?

41:23.240 --> 41:24.319
Uh...

41:27.080 --> 41:28.080
- No.
- You all right?

41:28.080 --> 41:29.560
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.
- Sure?

41:29.560 --> 41:32.120
Have a good day, guys

41:51.480 --> 41:52.720
Ooh!

41:54.480 --> 41:55.600
Mum. Hello.

41:55.600 --> 41:59.040
Eric, would you like to come and help me
at the soup kitchen tonight?

41:59.040 --> 42:02.720
Oh... I can't. I'm going to Abbi's.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.760
We're watching <i>Jennifer's Body</i>
and gonna do pedicures.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.040
But maybe next time.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
<i>♪ Yes I do, yes I do... ♪</i>

43:06.319 --> 43:07.319
See this.

43:12.240 --> 43:15.280
What? No. Oh my gosh.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.400
Why do birds hate me?

43:19.400 --> 43:21.120
Why are you laughing?

43:21.120 --> 43:23.760
This is the second bird
that has pooed on me today.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.280
That means you're very lucky.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.040
Oh, well, dunno about that.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.520
Can you spare some change
for a meal tonight?

43:29.520 --> 43:31.080
Oh gosh. I don't have any cash on me.

43:31.080 --> 43:34.680
But there is a soup kitchen
at the village hall tonight.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.319
I don't know where that is. Show me?

43:36.319 --> 43:38.720
I can't. I can't go dressed like this.

43:38.720 --> 43:43.720
But, um... if you... if you take this street,
take a left, you'll definitely find it.

43:44.400 --> 43:47.200
Come on, lucky boy.
You can spare a few minutes of your time.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.560
I... I am late, but, yes, we're walking.

44:09.280 --> 44:12.240
Was there anyone I can call for you
to come and pick you up?

44:13.160 --> 44:14.680
No, it's okay. I have a lift.

44:25.520 --> 44:29.040
This is run by my church,
so you'll get a good meal.

44:31.600 --> 44:32.799
Oh my gosh.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.240
Uh... Ah.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.680
Okay, so this is the soup kitchen.

44:38.319 --> 44:40.920
I hope you have a great meal tonight.
I need to go, okay?

44:40.920 --> 44:41.960
You're leaving?

44:42.680 --> 44:45.240
- Yeah.
- This is where you belong.

44:47.080 --> 44:49.640
Eric! You changed your mind.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.440
What are you wearing?

44:51.440 --> 44:54.000
I wasn't supposed to be here, Mum, was I?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.160
We are totally run off our feet.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.480
Okay. I'll make a phone call.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.720
Thank you, my son.

45:04.480 --> 45:07.080
Hey, Abbi, so I'm helpin' out
at the village hall,

45:07.080 --> 45:11.400
at the soup kitchen tonight, and they're
really short on staff, so I'm sorry.

45:12.600 --> 45:13.640
Don't hate me.

45:14.440 --> 45:18.680
All interpersonal relationships
have boundaries.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.600
Now, they aren't often spoken about,

45:23.600 --> 45:26.600
but they are mutually understood

45:26.600 --> 45:29.960
to be limits within the relationship.

45:30.760 --> 45:35.520
Now, if a person
doesn't know their own boundaries,

45:35.520 --> 45:39.160
then that can cause resentment
in the relationship.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.120
- The opposite--
- Uh...

45:41.120 --> 45:43.560
Do you think maybe
we should go to a caller now?

45:45.160 --> 45:47.960
Yes, that's a great idea. Thank you, O.

45:47.960 --> 45:50.240
All right. We have Martin.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.839
Martin, you're on the line.

45:51.839 --> 45:53.040
<i>Yes. Yes. Ahem...</i>

45:53.040 --> 45:54.280
<i>Yes. Hello.</i>

45:54.280 --> 45:58.240
<i>I was calling
because I was having relations</i>

45:58.240 --> 45:59.839
<i>with a new lady friend,</i>

45:59.839 --> 46:02.560
<i>and I was struggling to perform.</i>

46:02.560 --> 46:05.000
I used some Viagra, but it did nothing.

46:06.120 --> 46:07.640
Is there a problem with my manhood?

46:07.640 --> 46:13.160
Uh, for listeners who don't know,
Viagra is the brand name of sildenafil,

46:13.160 --> 46:17.680
which is a medicine
used for erectile dysfunction.

46:17.680 --> 46:20.200
Martin, this lady friend.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.560
Could you tell us more
about that situation?

46:22.560 --> 46:26.440
Well, I've, um... recently separated
from my wife.

46:26.440 --> 46:29.200
I'm living in a new place,
and I've just started a new job.

46:29.200 --> 46:31.280
Wow, sounds like a lot of change.

46:31.280 --> 46:34.520
<i>Well, I wonder if those two things
are maybe related?</i>

46:34.520 --> 46:37.600
And I'm getting the nod here
from Dr. Milburn, so...

46:37.600 --> 46:43.520
Yes, uh, struggles with erections
can often be psychological.

46:43.520 --> 46:47.120
So I think it's important
that you look at the emotional

46:47.120 --> 46:48.480
as well as the physical.

46:48.480 --> 46:51.319
Do you mind me asking
where your brain went during the sex?

46:52.760 --> 46:54.319
I was thinking about my wife.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.680
<i>Sorry. My ex-wife.</i>

46:59.319 --> 47:00.720
I miss her.

47:01.520 --> 47:04.960
<i>She's moved on,
and I thought if I could have a fling,</i>

47:04.960 --> 47:06.680
<i>I might be able to move on too.</i>

47:07.200 --> 47:09.760
<i>But it was humiliating
and made me feel pathetic</i>,

47:09.760 --> 47:11.280
<i>like I'm not a real man.</i>

47:11.799 --> 47:13.600
Can I ask you a question?

47:15.359 --> 47:18.680
Did the sex feel like you were cheating?

47:18.680 --> 47:20.080
It did.

47:20.680 --> 47:21.920
It felt like a betrayal.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.760
I'm wondering, Martin,

47:24.760 --> 47:29.000
if you might be someone
who just operates better

47:29.000 --> 47:31.120
when you have a secure connection.

47:31.120 --> 47:36.000
And when you do,
your penis functions properly.

47:36.760 --> 47:37.640
Do you mean...

47:38.480 --> 47:40.240
my penis has to be in love?

47:40.240 --> 47:45.319
I think that you might need to find a way
to cut all emotional ties with your ex

47:45.319 --> 47:48.600
so that your penis is free
to let go and move on.

47:50.799 --> 47:53.080
Okay. Okay.

47:53.080 --> 47:56.120
<i>And no doubt,
your manhood is still intact,</i>

47:56.120 --> 47:58.760
<i>regardless of the blood flow
to your penis.</i>

47:58.760 --> 48:00.839
- Wow.
- <i>Thanks for your call, Martin.</i>

48:00.839 --> 48:03.160
- God, they're good together.
- <i>Let's go to another one.</i>

48:03.160 --> 48:04.879
- Oh. Sorry.
- <i>Next up, we have Susan.</i>

48:04.879 --> 48:06.799
<i>- Hello, Susan.</i>
- <i>Hi there.</i>

48:06.799 --> 48:08.640
<i>I wanted to talk about role play.</i>

48:08.640 --> 48:09.560
Ta.

48:10.720 --> 48:14.560
- All right, Savior, where do you want me?
- Hi! What are you doing here?

48:14.560 --> 48:17.960
- You said you needed help.
- Are you sure? You really don't need to.

48:17.960 --> 48:19.400
- Yeah, I want to.
- Yeah?

48:19.400 --> 48:22.040
I used to do stuff like this
with my church all the time.

48:22.040 --> 48:24.879
Okay. Well, my mum is over there.
She's in a blue jumper.

48:24.879 --> 48:27.240
She's the boss. She'll tell you
everything you need to know.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.280
- Okay?
- It's Abbi, Eric's friend.

48:29.280 --> 48:32.359
- Oh, hello.
- It's so nice to meet you finally.

48:32.359 --> 48:34.400
How are those potatoes looking?

48:34.400 --> 48:38.080
It's wonderful to have people
outside the church come to help.

48:39.359 --> 48:43.920
It's just so sad we've lost our funding,
so this place will have to shut down.

48:47.680 --> 48:50.120
Um... Sorry. Do you want some plantain?

48:50.120 --> 48:51.280
- Yes please.
- Yeah?

48:51.879 --> 48:53.600
- Thank you.
- There you go. No worries.

48:54.160 --> 48:55.200
Right. Okay. So...

49:05.080 --> 49:07.680
It was a real pleasure, Dr. Milburn.

49:07.680 --> 49:08.799
You too, O.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.319
- She's great.
- Yeah.

49:11.319 --> 49:13.560
And you did a lot better, too,
little fella.

49:14.120 --> 49:15.200
See you next time?

49:15.760 --> 49:17.359
- See you next time.
- Toodle pip.
