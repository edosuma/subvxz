WEBVTT

01:38.599 --> 01:39.759
Kemp: Don't move.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.636
Turn around.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.519
Keep your hands wide.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.743
You want something
from me, mister?

02:07.419 --> 02:09.535
Sure came up quiet.
Got to give you credit.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.129
My name's Tate.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.877
Guess that don't mean
much to you,

02:14.968 --> 02:16.879
or anyone else, huh?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.210
This here is pokey.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.096
You fixing to meet somebody?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.674
Meet somebody? Who?

02:25.228 --> 02:27.389
Wouldn't mind if I did.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.437
Wouldn't care who he was
or where he comes from

02:29.524 --> 02:31.355
or what he does.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.900
A man ought to always
mind his own business, I say.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.276
Looks like you're the one
expecting company.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.030
How long have you been here?

02:42.120 --> 02:45.032
Been poking around these hills
three or four weeks now.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.409
Got no calendar to know exact.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.618
Got nothing to show
for it either.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.498
If you're ready to talk some,
I'd appreciate

02:52.589 --> 02:54.079
your putting that gun down.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.664
You might get bee stung
or something

02:55.759 --> 02:57.295
but I'd be just as dead.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.557
Got some breakfast
coffee boiling.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.260
You want some? = no.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.975
Eh, tobacco?

03:14.820 --> 03:17.732
This party you're asking
after...

03:17.823 --> 03:19.029
Friend of yours?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.406
He killed a marshal.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.708
Kansas?

03:31.795 --> 03:33.205
You've come a ways.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.873
It ain't every peace officer
who'd do that.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.050
I ain't seen Kansas
since before the war,

03:40.137 --> 03:42.970
so I wouldn't know
you to look at.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.014
My name's Tate, like I said.
Jesse Tate.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.223
Howard kemp.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.055
You figure he's back
in these hills, Mr. kemp?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.731
I lost his trail
this side of the river.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.810
- Did you see any sign?
- Hmm.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.145
Ran across a dead fire
the other day.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.358
Where? = back in there.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.990
Got no map to tell you sure.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.945
Now, you can tell me
better than that.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.532
Maybe. If we was going the same
way, but we ain't.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.000
Helping you don't put
no money in my pocket.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.424
- 1 got $20 here.
- $20!

04:21.511 --> 04:24.753
$20. It's yours if you get
me on a fresh trail.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.338
$20! Ah!

04:26.433 --> 04:27.548
$10 now...

04:28.894 --> 04:31.180
$10 now, $10 when we find him.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.353
Start out by showing me
that dead fire.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.224
Does this fellow know
you're after him?

04:37.319 --> 04:38.604
He knows.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.335
Then he might be waiting
behind some rock.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.487
Waiting for us to ride up
in front of his gun.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.533
Uh-huh.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.491
He might.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.716
It was still warm yesterday.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.174
Horses moved out this way.
More than one, for sure.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.054
This fellow got company?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.681
Could be packing an extra horse.

05:13.772 --> 05:16.434
But there might be two of them
waiting for us, huh?

05:16.525 --> 05:18.015
That's why you held
the gun on me.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.474
Come on, let's go. Come on.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.560
Trail's as plain for you
as it is for me.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.788
- Another fire.
- They ain't making much time.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.339
Must be something
wrong with them.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.667
Looks like a horse fell there.
= yeah.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.267
- Well, it's no use guessing.
- Ahhh...

06:17.085 --> 06:18.746
Look out, rocks! = ride!

06:27.262 --> 06:28.614
Well, I guess that's
the end of it.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.300
Yeah, if it was a natural slide.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.644
Jesse: Look out! Look out!

07:43.004 --> 07:44.960
Well, you found him.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.788
Uh, he's got to come
down sometime.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.498
Yeah, but when? A day, a week.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.273
And the chance is
he sneaks down some night

07:50.345 --> 07:51.460
and gets us.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.294
We'll take turn on watch.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.974
Having it out with this fellow
ain't my job, not for no $20.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.096
You've got him,
but he got you too.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.225
Unless there's another
way up there.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.816
You're crazy!
You can't get up there!

08:06.903 --> 08:08.359
Go up the trail
and get some cover

08:08.446 --> 08:09.924
and take a shot at him
every once in a while,

08:09.948 --> 08:12.064
and make him think
we're stuck down here.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.158
Ain't we?

08:16.538 --> 08:17.618
Come on.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.955
Hold it!

08:29.342 --> 08:30.832
- What's the trouble?
- Get down.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.200
I heard some shooting
and came to look.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.304
Who are you?

08:39.185 --> 08:41.301
Oh, that's the way it is?

08:41.396 --> 08:43.603
Lieutenant Roy Anderson,
sixth cavalry.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.180
Indian fighter extraordinary.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.607
You're a long way
from an army post, lieutenant.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.400
I quit playing soldier
last week.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.024
Uh-huh.
Let's see your discharge.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.982
I'm riding east, from fort
Ellis. What's wrong with that?

08:55.076 --> 08:57.783
Nothing, except the Bozeman
trail runs east from Ellis.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.532
How come you're this far off it?

08:59.622 --> 09:01.308
Well, you see, there's some
bad-tempered Indians

09:01.332 --> 09:03.243
along the Bozeman trail and...

09:03.334 --> 09:05.294
Seems this chief's daughter
fell into some trouble

09:05.336 --> 09:08.294
with a handsome,
young army lieutenant, and...

09:08.381 --> 09:09.712
Well, you know how it is.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.639
The army never
did understand me.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.478
Yeah.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.019
Hey, how about these?

09:25.106 --> 09:26.687
Alright, give him back his gun.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.731
Come on.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.184
Oh, you never did tell me

09:31.279 --> 09:33.691
what the shooting was about.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.738
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.783
This here is Mr. kemp.
My name is Tate, Jesse Tate.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.111
You don't say?

09:41.206 --> 09:42.912
We've got an outlaw killer
trapped up there

09:42.999 --> 09:46.036
starting rockslides
every time we show our heads.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.960
An outlaw killer throwing rocks?

09:49.047 --> 09:51.003
That sounds real desperate.
= come on.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.582
Show him the picture, Mr. kemp.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.041
Come on, show me.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.476
You followed him
all the way from Kansas?

10:08.566 --> 10:10.648
He did. I joined up
with him this morning.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.726
Sort of helping out.
Like a deputy.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.280
Looks like you got
yourself a real

10:17.367 --> 10:19.232
interesting problem
in tactics, sheriff.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.943
Yeah. Come on up the trail.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.530
Crazy, ain't it, pokey,
what one man

10:25.625 --> 10:27.490
will do to catch another?

10:30.213 --> 10:31.669
I'd put my carcass to climbing

10:31.756 --> 10:33.417
that cliff and never
think twice.

10:33.508 --> 10:34.623
Hey, come on.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.371
I thought you said
you were going someplace?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.035
Oh, don't mind me,
I won't get in the way.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.563
I'll be right here
behind you, sheriff,

11:52.587 --> 11:54.452
in case the bad man
sticks his head out.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.199
Wonder if I can make it.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.213
- Now, what do you want here?
- Just offering my help.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.010
- Why?
- Why are you turning it down?

12:45.098 --> 12:47.089
If I burn my hands,
I'll let you try it again.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.976
Now, stand by with your gun.
I did as much for you.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.880
Now, ain't that the way?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.633
A man gets set for trouble
head-on,

14:55.728 --> 14:58.595
and it sneaks up behind him
every time.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.849
That's life.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.057
Get up.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.148
Open your gun belt
and let it fall.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.109
No need to fuss there, soldier.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.700
I've been out of cartridges
since abilene.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.418
You can see.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.127
Now why don't you just
do what I say?

15:32.265 --> 15:35.098
Hey, you two! It's all over!

15:35.184 --> 15:36.515
Get him, Ben!

16:04.213 --> 16:05.703
Ohh! Ah!

16:34.118 --> 16:37.281
Alright, Ben. Tie him up!

16:37.371 --> 16:39.737
Lina: Let me go, let me alone!
Let me alone!

16:39.832 --> 16:41.912
Roy: Calm down, sweetheart,
we're not gonna hang you.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.374
I ain't fighting you
no more, Howie.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.341
- Not the three of you, I ain't.
- Who's she?

16:52.428 --> 16:54.714
You remember old frank patch,
don't you, Howie?

16:56.390 --> 16:57.846
This here is his daughter, Lina.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.890
I remember an outlaw,
name of patch,

16:59.977 --> 17:02.013
lying dead in front
of a bank in abilene.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.470
I don't remember
any talk about kinfolk.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.805
He was my father.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.856
Howard: What's she doing
here with you?

17:07.944 --> 17:09.935
I guess she don't know
nobody but me.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.238
And I didn't figure on seeing
Kansas again.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.656
Till now I didn't.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.075
Alright, get up.
Come on, get up!

17:19.497 --> 17:21.488
Here you are, Tate.
That settles us.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.538
I'm much obliged to you.
= thanks.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.538
Say, Mr. kemp, now you've got
two of them to handle,

17:26.629 --> 17:28.995
maybe you still have a mind
to hire up help.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.796
This is my job, I'll do it.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.248
Make you feel any better,
sheriff,

17:32.343 --> 17:35.756
you can make me deputy,
official-like.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.302
You ain't letting
on like you was

17:37.390 --> 17:39.176
a sheriff or something,
are you, Howie?

17:39.267 --> 17:41.974
Why, sure he is. Ain't he?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.268
He told me he was
a peace officer.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.516
I don't know
why you should do that.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.407
No matter who gets me,
the reward still holds.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.145
How's that?

17:50.236 --> 17:52.272
Ain't you showed him
my picture, Howie?

17:52.363 --> 17:53.978
I seen a paper saying
he was wanted,

17:54.073 --> 17:55.438
nothing about no reward.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.615
Maybe he ain't got a good copy
like I have.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.867
Ben: Is that what he showed you?
- How much?

18:07.962 --> 18:12.251
Says $5,000. Why, you talk like
you knowed it all along.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.707
Why else would a man
tear off the bottom of a poster?

18:17.471 --> 18:19.462
I'm taking him back
and I'm gonna do it alone.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.431
You didn't catch him alone.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.804
You was goin' round and round
until you run into me.

18:24.895 --> 18:28.137
You were hired to do a job
and you were paid for it.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.816
You ain't gonna buy
my claim on this for no $20.

18:31.902 --> 18:35.019
What about him?
He done the climbing, didn't he?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.320
Could have gotten killed, too.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.822
Tell you what,
I'll settle for a third.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.904
How about you, Jesse?
Share and share alike?

18:44.999 --> 18:46.364
That's the way it is.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.324
Unless you're of
a mind to kill us all.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.797
Looks like you got yourself
a couple of partners, Howie.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.216
Ahh. Quit acting like we
was friends! You...

18:58.971 --> 19:01.132
Maybe we sat down at the same
card game once or twice

19:01.223 --> 19:03.259
but that don't mean
dirt to me now.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.683
You shot a man in the back

19:05.770 --> 19:07.852
and I'm taking you in
to hang for it.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.894
It wasn't Ben
that killed that man.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.064
Howard: It's him they're paying
the reward on.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.393
Now, where are your horses?
= back at the rocks.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.525
Lina's horse has got a bellyful
of disease. He can't travel.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.278
He can't, huh? Alright,
come on, let's go. Come on.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.916
Easy, boy, easy.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.288
Easy there, boy.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.920
Alright, watch him.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.298
Easy, boy, easy.

19:40.596 --> 19:44.009
He's really sick, mister,
that's why we held up here.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.056
Must have took bad
water some place.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.871
I rode him two days like this
when he should have

19:47.895 --> 19:49.101
rested and throwed it off.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.185
Easy, boy. Easy.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.192
What are you gonna do, mister?

20:00.282 --> 20:02.614
Oh, that horse is suffering,
he can't hardly breathe.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.866
You've seen sicker horses
than this, ain't you, mister?

20:08.958 --> 20:11.119
He's pretty bad, girlie.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.950
No sense in shooting
a good horse

20:13.045 --> 20:14.660
just to hang me a day sooner.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.915
You keep out of this.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.234
Besides, if we ain't
to the big river

20:17.258 --> 20:18.543
before the rains,

20:18.634 --> 20:19.653
it's another week downstream

20:19.677 --> 20:22.293
to find a crossing.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.094
Nobody's gonna touch my horse.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.887
Nobody is.
Nobody is gonna touch my...

20:25.975 --> 20:27.536
Come on, girlie, you don't
want to leave him

20:27.560 --> 20:29.516
for some cat or bear
to rip open.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.766
No, I'm not gonna go, no...

20:32.857 --> 20:34.563
Let me.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.561
Well, there's no reward
for killing my horse!

20:40.740 --> 20:42.150
Ben, don't let them
kill my horse.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.651
Don't let them kill my horse!

20:43.743 --> 20:45.654
Listen to me! Listen to me!

20:45.745 --> 20:48.532
That horse wouldn't have
lasted the night, anyway.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.659
Forget about him. Start worrying
about me swinging from a rope.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.207
You want that? = no.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.706
I need time.
You understand, Lina?

20:55.796 --> 20:58.458
Time. And you've gotta help me.

20:58.549 --> 21:01.837
I've already scratched open
a sore spot over that reward.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.964
The longer we ride,
the more things that can happen.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.467
That's the fight.
Are you listening?

21:09.185 --> 21:10.425
Listen to me.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.189
I heard you, Ben.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.688
I heard you.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.529
Alright, come on.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.308
Move, you lop-eared
cactus-eater!

21:53.395 --> 21:54.726
Quit dragging your feet.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.554
Pokey don't like it
no more than you do.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.443
Honey, first thing I'm gonna get
you out of that reward money

22:03.531 --> 22:06.523
is the biggest steak in Kansas,
for that cheek.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.777
Oh, you're not gonna be mad at
me all the way, are you?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.527
Come on, I'll make it up to you.

22:11.622 --> 22:12.828
What're you doing tonight?

22:17.545 --> 22:19.786
You're having quite a time,
aren't you?

22:19.880 --> 22:22.166
Ahh, come on, loosen up.
Spring is here.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.250
It's gonna be a long,
lonely ride to abilene.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.461
And being as Jesse's too old,
I'll toss you for her.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.217
Right now, she's probably
telling Ben

22:30.307 --> 22:32.798
how to cut your throat.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.813
You don't think that pretty
little thing would...

22:36.230 --> 22:37.686
Roy: Hey, you two,
break it up there!

23:15.311 --> 23:16.676
Here, try it with this.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.808
Come on, don't be stubborn.
Press it against your face.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.811
- Get away from me.
- Like it better this way?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.268
Let me go, let me alone!

23:29.283 --> 23:31.524
If she bothers you so much,
why don't you tie her up

23:31.619 --> 23:32.904
and be done with her?

23:32.995 --> 23:35.532
No bother.
I like to wrestle with her.

23:35.623 --> 23:38.535
You're a big man
for beating up women, ain't you?

23:38.626 --> 23:39.661
And you're no better.

23:40.461 --> 23:41.667
Lina.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.842
That jackass started a misery
in my back.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.139
Can you do me?

24:00.064 --> 24:01.895
Don't get them fired up
all the time.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.973
Best thing on our side
is your pretty face.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.067
They're men, honey,
and you ain't.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.381
- Remember that.
- I'm not gonna...

24:08.405 --> 24:10.771
I ain't asking you
to marry them.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.232
The more they look at you, the
less they'll be seeing of me.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.623
You sure got her trained, Ben.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.621
Tell you, if I was
to have a daughter,

24:23.712 --> 24:26.579
I wouldn't want her no different
than Lina here.

24:26.674 --> 24:29.381
Except she shouldn't have
such sharp nails.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.631
Maybe not so much temper.
= hold still!

24:32.721 --> 24:34.757
Honey, you remember those
cigars I got put away?

24:34.848 --> 24:36.054
I could do with one how.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.473
Get two.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.845
I don't smoke.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.266
Any more at home like her?

24:46.735 --> 24:48.942
She got no home,
that's the trouble.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.145
Ma died in Paso a couple
of months ago

24:51.240 --> 24:53.231
and she come up north
hunting her pa.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.236
He was dead and planted
when she got here.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.535
So, of course, you felt obliged
to look out for her.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.908
Son, her pa was my best friend.

25:10.467 --> 25:14.301
Hey, Jesse! Why don't you get
a pan and do it right?

25:14.388 --> 25:17.095
- What do you know about gold?
- Just what I heard.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.467
Come on, let's get riding.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.424
What's the crazy hurry?
We can camp here.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.225
That's right, Howie,
a day more or less

25:22.312 --> 25:25.054
won't change the price on me.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.437
Of course, it might give one of
you boys time to think.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.063
Plain arithmetic.

25:30.154 --> 25:33.942
Money splits better two ways
instead of three.

25:45.294 --> 25:46.500
Come on.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.935
Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!

26:05.022 --> 26:06.637
Hiyah! Hiyah!

26:37.429 --> 26:40.387
How can you breathe
that stinking rope?

26:40.474 --> 26:42.510
Kills the taste
of your cooking, Jesse.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.849
Nothing like a good woman
to stir a pot.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.477
Nothing like a good woman.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.273
I guess you've got
the years to know

26:52.361 --> 26:55.398
better than any of us, Jesse.
Did you ever marry one of them?

26:55.489 --> 26:57.650
Never had to,
with my good looks.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.113
No sense in asking Roy
here about women.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.365
He'd keep us up all night.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.663
Well, right now,
I'm sort of in between.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.045
Even kemp.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.215
Never should have
marched off to war, Howie.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.792
Should have stayed home
and married the girl.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.673
Of course, it's none
of my business.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.471
That's right, it's none
of your business.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.220
Come on, let's get
this stuff cleaned up.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.050
Alright, girlie, grab a handful.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.761
I'll do mine and Ben's.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.814
You'll do what I tell you,
that's what you'll do.

27:31.900 --> 27:32.900
Women.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.270
I think I'll go along,
to protect her.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.196
Sure works on me.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.244
The way his eyes hang on her.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.621
Fancy-talking eastern boy.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.328
Trouble is, talk's
just the beginning

27:54.423 --> 27:56.664
with wild kids like that.
You watch.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.965
When he's ready,
he'll reach out and take.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.212
And who's to stop him?

28:06.810 --> 28:09.597
Di... did you think
I was gonna jump you?

28:09.688 --> 28:11.770
That's right. = no.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.974
No, I was... just uncramping.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.107
You look almost sorry I didn't.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.273
Yeah, killing me in self-defense

28:22.367 --> 28:24.449
is a lot better than
killing me for money.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.319
Well, it's your choice, Ben.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.915
A bullet right here on the trail
or a rope in abilene.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.499
Choosing the way to die,
what's the difference?

28:38.342 --> 28:40.879
Choosing the way to live,
that's the hard part.

28:42.346 --> 28:43.907
That's what's eating you,
ain't it, Howie?

28:43.931 --> 28:45.171
There's nothing eating me!

28:45.265 --> 28:46.926
Somebody was bound
to collect on you.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.929
Maybe.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.762
I calculated some
horse-thieving scum

28:52.856 --> 28:56.565
would want the price on my hide,
but not you, Howie...

28:56.652 --> 28:57.812
Now, why don't you shut up?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.768
Ben: Not a man of your leanings.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.605
Not a ranching man.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.815
I don't deny you got
a dirty deal, but...

29:06.578 --> 29:08.364
Ahhh!

29:08.455 --> 29:10.912
The things a gal
can do to a man.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.205
Ohhh. Shut up!

29:33.397 --> 29:34.557
Hold it up here!

29:38.527 --> 29:40.563
Might save a day if we went
over instead of around.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.228
A day might make the difference.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.689
Better take a look first
and find some kind of trail.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.365
Wait, I got some glasses.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.202
I knew you had your nuggets
hid somewhere under me.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.577
I wouldn't be
putting up with you

29:59.631 --> 30:01.087
if I had nuggets to take back.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.174
Let me get in there.

30:03.719 --> 30:07.052
Funny you ain't had no luck
in this country.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.300
A fellow I know
struck gold just north of here.

30:10.475 --> 30:12.136
Half a mountain of it, almost.

30:12.227 --> 30:15.435
What fellow was that?
= a fellow I know.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.013
Only thing, he had more trouble
getting it out of the ground

30:18.108 --> 30:20.770
than he had finding it,
that's what I hear.

30:20.861 --> 30:21.861
He don't know much.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.853
Got them from an officer fellow.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.314
Swapped him even
for a paiute tomahawk.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.365
It weren't really paiute,
I made it myself.

30:31.621 --> 30:33.612
I had you figured
for a horse trader.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.668
Jesse!

30:40.756 --> 30:41.916
Keep your eye on 'em, Roy.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.962
Mind if I get off
and stand a while?

30:52.100 --> 30:53.100
Go ahead.

30:56.146 --> 30:57.306
You can, too.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.646
They gone up higher
to look ahead?

31:07.908 --> 31:10.320
Well, if a man could do that
with his own life.

31:12.329 --> 31:15.071
Maybe if I'd seen what was ahead
when I was younger,

31:15.165 --> 31:16.746
I wouldn't be in this fix.

31:18.502 --> 31:19.662
Ahh, of course I would.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.461
Some of the things...

31:25.342 --> 31:26.342
Nope.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.882
Nope, I wouldn't have done
nothing no different.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.725
Except for you, honey.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.304
I wouldn't have
dragged you with me.

31:40.399 --> 31:43.516
You didn't drag me, Ben.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.546
I wish there was some way
to protect you from Howie.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.777
He's gonna start on
you pretty soon.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.479
Kemp?

31:49.574 --> 31:52.236
I've seen him with women.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.658
He'll look and think...

31:55.038 --> 31:57.120
And then he'll
reach out and take.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.726
And the way things are,
who's gonna stop him?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.661
Me. Roy: You better.

32:02.796 --> 32:04.161
I'm the jealous type.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.921
Howard: Ah! It's not
much of a trail.

32:14.015 --> 32:16.506
I think we can make it
right through that pass.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.057
At least the pay is good.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.223
Give me those glasses.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.354
Jesse: What do you make of it?

32:30.449 --> 32:31.564
Howard: Indians.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.445
Two, four, six, seven, eight...

32:34.536 --> 32:36.572
- About 12 of them.
- Are they wearing paint?

32:36.663 --> 32:37.869
It's hard to tell.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.288
Right up there.

32:41.918 --> 32:45.001
Jesse: Yeah, they're
just blackfeet.

32:45.088 --> 32:47.875
Nothing to worry about. Been no
trouble with them for years.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.173
A little far south
for blackfeet, aren't we?

32:50.260 --> 32:52.421
Hunting party, I guess.
= uh-huh.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.628
Hunting what?

33:17.078 --> 33:19.034
Alright, mount up.
We're going over.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.702
Oh yeah, and don't
get nervous if we see

33:22.792 --> 33:24.657
a couple of Indians
coming up behind.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.539
- Indians?
- Don't worry. Don't worry, now.

33:26.630 --> 33:27.836
They're just blackfeet.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.788
Take it easy
on the trail up there.

33:29.883 --> 33:31.027
Wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?

33:31.051 --> 33:32.712
You want to get us all scalped?

33:32.802 --> 33:35.088
We got nothing they want.
Isn't that right, Jesse?

33:35.180 --> 33:37.671
Yup. = Indians are Indians.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.243
We can cover this trail
and finish them off

33:39.267 --> 33:40.473
when they come through.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.720
Howard: Why look for trouble?

33:45.732 --> 33:48.018
What's the matter, lieutenant?

33:48.109 --> 33:50.100
Alright, if you want to know,
they're after me.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.195
They've been hunting me
ever since I left the fort.

33:54.491 --> 33:56.573
Now that's something else again.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.493
This chief's daughter
you was holding hands with,

33:59.579 --> 34:01.240
was she willing?

34:01.331 --> 34:03.663
Never mind the sermon.
We've got a fight on our hands.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.786
Howard: This is your
fight, not ours.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.538
You expect me
to take them alone?

34:07.629 --> 34:09.290
Roy: They don't just kill a man.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.214
He's right. If them Indians
are out to revenge a squaw,

34:12.300 --> 34:14.006
they'll make him holler first.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.676
Do the same thing to us
if we're with him.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.719
Maybe worse.

34:18.807 --> 34:21.594
Alright, you better start riding
the skin off that horse of yours

34:21.685 --> 34:23.391
if you want to stay
out ahead of them.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.727
The reward cuts
bigger two ways, huh?

34:27.649 --> 34:29.014
You're losing time.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.618
Alright, now keep close
together. You ride next to Ben.

34:44.124 --> 34:45.124
Come on.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.851
J oh happy home [

35:51.941 --> 35:54.978
j where art thou now? J

36:41.449 --> 36:42.655
Now just sit easy.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.060
- Get behind that stump.
- Right.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.010
Get down!

39:32.662 --> 39:34.823
Anybody got a match?

39:34.914 --> 39:36.529
You could have
got us all killed.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.909
It worked, didn't it?

39:46.259 --> 39:47.820
Did you think I was
gonna let those Indians

39:47.844 --> 39:49.425
ride me into the ground?

39:49.512 --> 39:51.878
Let them peel my hide
over a slow-burning fire?

39:53.057 --> 39:54.513
Oh, no.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.718
Not me... partners.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.438
Come on, mount up.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.144
You can't sit a horse
with a slug

40:08.239 --> 40:09.399
in your leg, Howie.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.980
You get on that burro.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.235
Come on.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.002
He's done a day's work.

41:52.093 --> 41:53.299
Fix a fire.

42:04.605 --> 42:05.890
Where are they?

42:06.649 --> 42:07.980
Where are they?

42:08.067 --> 42:09.352
Where'd they take her?

42:09.444 --> 42:11.150
Where'd they take her?
Let go now.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.352
Get your hands off.

42:12.447 --> 42:13.983
Get your hands off me.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.188
I've got to find her.

42:15.283 --> 42:16.283
I got to.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.940
I got to... I got to find her.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.072
- I've got to...
- He been like this long?

42:20.163 --> 42:21.448
Not as bad.

42:29.505 --> 42:31.336
What are you trying to do,
drown him?

42:31.424 --> 42:32.960
Here, give me that handkerchief.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.847
Mary, Mary, Mary...

42:46.981 --> 42:48.141
Mary.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.307
Don't worry.

42:51.402 --> 42:54.314
The war won't last a year.
I'll be home before you know it.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.469
No sense getting married,
and then having to say goodbye.

42:58.493 --> 42:59.699
Howard: You understand that.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.990
Sure, I understand.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.664
Now, get some sleep.

43:06.751 --> 43:09.834
You can manage, Mary. The boys
will take care of the stock.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.788
When I get back, it'll be just
like we talked about last night.

43:14.634 --> 43:16.420
You understand, Mary?

43:16.511 --> 43:17.842
You remember what you said?

43:18.805 --> 43:20.636
I remember.

43:20.723 --> 43:23.385
I said, "I'll wait for you."

43:30.566 --> 43:33.023
He got what was coming to him.

43:33.111 --> 43:35.102
Half of abilene knows about it.

43:35.196 --> 43:37.107
I've heard of some big suckers
in my time but...

43:37.198 --> 43:38.859
This ain't our affair.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.486
You know what he done?

43:42.578 --> 43:46.070
He signed over his ranch to this
gal, so she could work it legal.

43:46.165 --> 43:47.746
Guess what?

43:47.834 --> 43:50.075
Come back to find out
she'd sold it.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.626
Used the money to run off
with another fellow.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.078
It's nothing to laugh at.

43:55.216 --> 43:58.208
No? Well, laugh at this then.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.133
What am I supposed to do? Cry?

44:00.221 --> 44:01.506
Feel sorry for him?

44:03.307 --> 44:04.827
Ben: I got nothing against
these fellows.

44:04.851 --> 44:06.637
They just happened along.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.592
But him...

44:08.688 --> 44:12.397
I never hurt him no wise,
and he starts out to hunt me

44:12.483 --> 44:15.145
days, weeks, like an animal.

44:15.236 --> 44:16.851
That's enough.

44:16.946 --> 44:18.402
This ain't none of our business.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.522
He wants his land back.

44:22.618 --> 44:24.654
And I'll tell you something.

44:24.745 --> 44:27.282
His end of the reward
ain't enough to buy it.

44:27.373 --> 44:28.704
That's your business.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.119
I think I'll make some coffee.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.548
Then why did he make a deal
with us, to begin with?

44:40.720 --> 44:43.257
Howie's a practical man.

44:43.347 --> 44:46.054
He needed you fellas' help to
get through this rough country.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.308
But the closer we get to abilene

44:49.395 --> 44:51.101
the more you've got to worry.

45:06.954 --> 45:09.161
Jesse: Give me my choice,
and I'll take hand-panning

45:09.248 --> 45:11.580
in running water, naturally.

45:11.667 --> 45:15.205
Especially when you're working
alone like I do.

45:15.296 --> 45:17.378
Of course, when you get a strike
in high country

45:17.465 --> 45:20.047
like here for instance...

45:20.134 --> 45:21.670
Your big problem
is getting the water

45:21.761 --> 45:23.376
to where you're digging.

45:23.471 --> 45:26.554
Yeah, that's the trouble
my friend had.

45:26.641 --> 45:29.678
Ground full of gold
and no water to work it. Hey!

45:29.769 --> 45:31.009
Now maybe you'll shut up.

45:32.146 --> 45:34.683
I've been meaning to ask...

45:34.774 --> 45:36.210
You talk like you've seen
this fellow's

45:36.234 --> 45:38.190
mine with your own eyes.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.733
I just heard.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.106
Never hit it, huh, Jesse?

45:42.198 --> 45:44.689
Nothing worth the mention.

45:44.784 --> 45:46.820
Seems I've been looking
all my life.

45:47.662 --> 45:49.243
All my life.

45:49.330 --> 45:52.697
That's a long time to look
for something.

45:52.792 --> 45:55.579
Ben: Maybe you've been looking
in the wrong places.

45:55.670 --> 45:58.878
Fellow says, "there's gold in
the valley,” I go to the valley.

45:58.965 --> 46:01.672
Fellow says, "dig here,” I dig.

46:01.759 --> 46:05.343
Fellow says, "there's a rush
on to the north,” I go north.

46:05.429 --> 46:08.421
In '49, I run to California.

46:08.516 --> 46:10.928
Still remember,
spent good money for maps.

46:11.018 --> 46:13.225
Even made my own maps.

46:13.312 --> 46:15.303
I've seen fellows
too drunk to walk

46:15.398 --> 46:17.889
fall on their face
and find gold.

46:17.984 --> 46:19.099
But never me.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.439
Howard: Hey, Jesse!

46:24.824 --> 46:26.940
Where's Roy?

46:27.034 --> 46:30.151
He rode off before dawn.
Didn't say where.

46:30.246 --> 46:32.282
That's enough shaving.
Give me that.

46:34.542 --> 46:35.542
Drop it there.

46:42.425 --> 46:45.963
Well, you slept yourself out.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.964
Must be halfway to noon almost.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.420
Why didn't somebody wake me?

46:49.515 --> 46:51.380
What's everybody lying
around for?

46:51.475 --> 46:53.306
Ooh!

46:53.394 --> 46:55.305
That tells you, better than me.

46:58.399 --> 47:00.014
You get him some breakfast.

47:00.109 --> 47:02.350
You can change
the wrapping, girlie.

47:02.445 --> 47:04.356
- Why me?
- Because I say so.

47:04.447 --> 47:05.903
Don't fuss all the time!

47:05.990 --> 47:07.946
Hold on, Jesse.

47:08.034 --> 47:10.320
This girl's been up half
the night taking care of him.

47:10.411 --> 47:12.072
Ben: She's wore out.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.573
Lina: Never mind, Ben.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.745
- Hey, I'll do it.
- Lay still.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.372
No, you don't have to.
= I'll do it.

47:26.344 --> 47:27.834
You sat up with me? = yeah.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.543
- Why?
- Somebody had to.

47:29.638 --> 47:31.970
You was raving,
so no one could sleep.

47:32.058 --> 47:33.969
Why should you care? =I don't.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.829
I'd have done it for a dog
if he was suffering.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.184
Thank you. = you're welcome.

47:41.108 --> 47:42.723
You said I was raving.
What about?

47:44.070 --> 47:46.106
Nothing that made sense.

47:46.197 --> 47:49.485
You thought I was your girl.
You kept calling me Mary.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.156
You were really out
of your head.

47:51.243 --> 47:53.450
We ain't nothing alike,
Mary and me.

47:53.537 --> 47:54.947
At least, that's what Ben says.

47:55.039 --> 47:56.719
Well, Ben's just like all
the rest of them.

47:56.791 --> 47:58.560
- He never even met her.
- Well, he knows what she did.

47:58.584 --> 47:59.915
What she did is her business.

48:00.002 --> 48:01.355
She had no business
selling your ranch.

48:01.379 --> 48:02.585
Alright, you're different.

48:02.671 --> 48:03.690
You would have done
it different.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.124
Let's let it go.

48:07.968 --> 48:10.050
How do you mean I'm different?

48:11.680 --> 48:13.716
I mean you got a man.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.298
At least you stick to him.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.162
- He's not my man.
- You're with him, ain't you?

48:17.186 --> 48:18.892
- Not like you mean.
- Alright, forget it.

48:25.486 --> 48:27.226
What are you doing
with Ben, anyway?

48:29.156 --> 48:31.488
Did you expect to run
and hide forever?

48:31.575 --> 48:33.566
Ben was taking me to California.

48:33.661 --> 48:34.901
He was gonna start new.

48:34.995 --> 48:36.531
Start new? At what?

48:37.706 --> 48:39.037
Ranching, maybe.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.661
He knows a lot about cattle.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.833
Yeah, other people's cattle.

48:44.672 --> 48:47.334
Did you ever think for a minute
that Ben had the temper

48:47.425 --> 48:49.711
to settle on the land?

48:49.802 --> 48:52.168
To clear it, to build on it?

48:52.263 --> 48:54.925
To bring in the cattle and...

48:55.015 --> 48:56.300
Nurse them through the winter

48:56.392 --> 49:00.260
and round up strays,

49:00.354 --> 49:03.471
brand calves?

49:03.566 --> 49:06.524
Start new? The only thing
Ben'll start is trouble.

49:08.446 --> 49:10.152
He's wild, sure.

49:10.239 --> 49:12.070
Like my father used to be.

49:12.158 --> 49:13.593
But they didn't do
one of the ten things

49:13.617 --> 49:14.737
that people blamed them for.

49:14.785 --> 49:15.985
He's mean. He was born mean...

49:16.036 --> 49:17.617
Ben took me for my father's sake

49:17.705 --> 49:18.765
when there was no cause
for him to,

49:18.789 --> 49:20.120
and he's treated me decent.

49:20.207 --> 49:21.768
Well, that's more than he's done
for most people.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.687
I've never seen him hurt no one,
except in a fair fight.

49:23.711 --> 49:25.591
- Sure, I know, sure.
- And who are you to talk?

49:25.629 --> 49:27.357
You didn't track him all this
way just 'cause he's mean.

49:27.381 --> 49:29.042
I never said I did.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.278
There's a lot of outlaws riding
free with no one after them.

49:31.302 --> 49:32.487
Ben could've killed a dozen men

49:32.511 --> 49:34.047
and you wouldn't
have looked twice

49:34.138 --> 49:35.878
if it wasn't for the reward.

49:47.234 --> 49:48.474
Where have you been?

49:51.947 --> 49:53.903
- How's the leg?
- Here you are.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.276
Breakfast in bed.

49:58.662 --> 49:59.947
What's this?

50:00.039 --> 50:02.121
You better eat it
before we tell you.

50:02.208 --> 50:04.620
I made a map of the trail ahead.
Here, take a look.

50:04.710 --> 50:05.870
I know the way.

50:08.047 --> 50:10.254
Hey, look.

50:10.341 --> 50:11.922
Here's this pony-backed Ridge

50:12.009 --> 50:14.295
marked along this
stretch of trees.

50:14.386 --> 50:16.923
You follow these mountains
right down to the big river

50:17.014 --> 50:18.720
and we'll meet
on the other side.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.968
Meet who?

50:21.060 --> 50:22.971
Well, what he means,
all of you go on ahead

50:23.062 --> 50:25.144
and I use this map
to catch up with you later.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.355
That's right, isn't it?

50:28.442 --> 50:30.182
It's the only smart way.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.608
Riding alone,
he can make up time

50:31.695 --> 50:33.026
it would take us days to cover.

50:33.113 --> 50:34.273
And the rain's coming.

50:36.450 --> 50:38.031
Well, Jesse, what do you think?

50:38.118 --> 50:39.654
I'm thinking if something
goes wrong

50:39.745 --> 50:41.326
and you don't meet up with us

50:41.413 --> 50:44.450
I stand to gain from it
as much as Roy here.

50:44.542 --> 50:46.203
That's a dirty idea.

50:46.293 --> 50:50.081
I ain't much proud of it,
but it's the truth.

50:50.172 --> 50:53.585
It won't be that way with me,
is all I can promise.

50:53.676 --> 50:57.464
As soon as we get across, we
wait for you on the other side.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.796
You got Jesse's word
on it, and mine.

51:13.237 --> 51:15.273
Here, this is yours.

51:15.364 --> 51:18.322
Come on, let's get the horses
ready. I'm riding with you.

51:18.409 --> 51:20.115
What are you trying to do?
Kill yourself?

51:20.202 --> 51:21.908
I ain't going to cheat you.

51:21.996 --> 51:23.265
You know, your trouble
is you just

51:23.289 --> 51:24.904
think of one thing at a time.

51:24.999 --> 51:28.082
If this is his plan to get rid
of me, who's next?

51:28.168 --> 51:29.533
Just think that over.

52:18.260 --> 52:20.842
Jesse: You better let Roy ride
drag. You ain't fit.

52:42.368 --> 52:44.324
You know, Howie

52:44.411 --> 52:47.574
I ain't been tied up like this
since I was knee high to spit.

52:50.292 --> 52:52.157
The time pa sold
our place in Missouri

52:52.252 --> 52:54.959
and started us out for Texas.

52:57.591 --> 52:59.627
I didn't want to go,
so I run off.

52:59.718 --> 53:02.835
He caught me, tied me up
and throwed me in the wagon.

53:05.265 --> 53:07.631
That was a hard winter.

53:07.726 --> 53:10.012
Ma caught the fever
and died on the way.

53:17.152 --> 53:20.019
Pa didn't amount
to much after that.

53:20.114 --> 53:23.072
Got gunned down in a saloon
before we ever saw Texas.

53:25.452 --> 53:26.692
After that I...

53:28.330 --> 53:30.195
Met up with some
wild, young fellows.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.953
You might say I come to no good.

53:43.595 --> 53:45.005
Look out!

54:39.735 --> 54:42.272
Come on, you buzzard bait, move.

55:39.253 --> 55:41.960
- Is it time yet?
- Pretty near.

55:42.047 --> 55:43.253
I can't sleep anyway.

55:46.260 --> 55:48.467
Might be a cat poking around.
I'll go and see.

57:19.811 --> 57:21.722
I better see
what's at the other end.

57:28.111 --> 57:30.898
Now, this ain't bad.

57:30.989 --> 57:33.071
We could all do with some of
Jesse's coffee.

57:36.078 --> 57:38.239
Hey, Roy...

57:38.330 --> 57:40.446
Wet cords are shrinking.
How about it?

57:40.540 --> 57:42.280
I'm not going out
in this weather.

57:58.350 --> 58:00.807
Easy there, girlie,
you'll have it all down on us.

58:06.858 --> 58:08.394
It runs back about 30 yards.

58:08.485 --> 58:09.725
Funnels down to another opening

58:09.778 --> 58:10.984
about big enough for a cat

58:11.071 --> 58:13.187
to crawl through. Or him.

58:15.325 --> 58:17.281
Ben: Hey, Lina, honey...

58:17.369 --> 58:19.781
This weather's creeping
into my bones.

58:21.123 --> 58:22.238
Can you do me?

58:33.468 --> 58:35.629
I wonder if you really need this

58:35.721 --> 58:37.131
or if you just like
to be rubbed.

58:37.222 --> 58:39.508
Same thing.

58:40.684 --> 58:42.299
A man needs what he likes.

58:51.778 --> 58:53.439
Poor old, Howie.

58:53.530 --> 58:57.443
That bad leg's
just about got him wore out.

58:57.534 --> 59:00.150
Might not be too sharp
on his watch tonight.

59:00.245 --> 59:02.156
Shouldn't have to stand one,
the way he is.

59:02.247 --> 59:03.828
Better for us.

59:03.915 --> 59:05.280
This might be our chance.

59:07.419 --> 59:09.410
He's coming around
on his feeling for you.

59:10.756 --> 59:12.496
If you was to sit up
with him tonight

59:12.591 --> 59:14.422
and tell him the things

59:14.509 --> 59:17.922
that a man likes to know,
you know.

59:18.013 --> 59:21.005
It'd only be a minute before I'd
be out of that hole in back.

59:21.099 --> 59:22.577
But if kemp finds out...
= finds out what?

59:22.601 --> 59:24.091
I'll be long gone.

59:25.645 --> 59:27.601
You're not gonna let me down,
are you, honey?

59:28.982 --> 59:30.722
No, Ben,

59:30.817 --> 59:32.353
- only...
- Only what?

59:34.029 --> 59:37.317
He's got no feeling for me.
= no?

59:37.407 --> 59:39.272
All he cares about
is the reward.

59:41.661 --> 59:43.071
Well, you're right, honey.

59:44.498 --> 59:45.954
You're better off out of it.

59:48.210 --> 59:51.043
I guess my only hope is
that he'll drop off

59:51.129 --> 59:53.370
at least long enough for me

59:53.465 --> 59:58.505
to pick up a rock
and smash his head in.

59:58.595 --> 1:00:01.052
I don't want to,
but time's running out.

1:00:05.185 --> 1:00:06.550
I can help you, Ben.

1:00:07.687 --> 1:00:09.473
The way you said.

1:00:09.564 --> 1:00:12.806
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1:00:14.236 --> 1:00:15.897
It'll be alright, honey.

1:00:15.987 --> 1:00:17.022
It'll be alright.

1:00:18.782 --> 1:00:20.192
Now, you get some coffee, huh?

1:01:40.197 --> 1:01:41.607
What's the matter?

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:43.438
Nothing. Restless.

1:01:47.704 --> 1:01:49.114
The stuff's been out
long enough.

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:50.571
It can't hurt. It's alright.

1:02:09.601 --> 1:02:11.557
It's, uh, making music.

1:02:14.147 --> 1:02:16.103
There's a sour one someplace.

1:02:21.363 --> 1:02:22.523
Roy's.

1:02:26.034 --> 1:02:27.345
You know, at that,
it sounds better

1:02:27.369 --> 1:02:28.700
than some fiddlers I've heard.

1:02:30.330 --> 1:02:32.412
Is dancing hard to learn?

1:02:32.499 --> 1:02:34.035
No, not the way I do it.

1:02:35.335 --> 1:02:36.791
Do you like it?

1:02:36.878 --> 1:02:38.743
Howard: Yeah, used to.

1:02:40.924 --> 1:02:43.916
Sometimes I just like to sit
outside by a window

1:02:44.010 --> 1:02:45.125
and listen to the music.

1:02:47.931 --> 1:02:49.171
Like now.

1:02:52.269 --> 1:02:53.884
Did you ever see
Mexican dancing?

1:03:00.110 --> 1:03:02.110
What are you gonna do
when you get back to abilene?

1:03:03.697 --> 1:03:04.982
Help Ben if I can.

1:03:05.073 --> 1:03:07.314
Don't you want anything
for yourself?

1:03:10.996 --> 1:03:13.612
Used to think of going
to California.

1:03:13.707 --> 1:03:14.913
Howard: Why California?

1:03:16.751 --> 1:03:18.787
Someplace new...

1:03:18.878 --> 1:03:22.120
Nobody caring who you are,
or where you come from.

1:03:23.258 --> 1:03:25.419
A place you could belong to.

1:03:26.803 --> 1:03:29.419
A house, maybe even neighbors.

1:03:32.100 --> 1:03:34.386
I had neighbors, you know.

1:03:34.477 --> 1:03:37.093
Tom Webster and his missus,
lived right across the river.

1:03:38.773 --> 1:03:42.311
Had four sons, each one of them
skinnier than the other.

1:03:42.402 --> 1:03:44.188
Always coming over
to lend a hand.

1:03:46.364 --> 1:03:48.229
Didn't give you much chance
to get lonesome.

1:03:49.951 --> 1:03:52.283
Although the house,
the house ain't much,

1:03:52.370 --> 1:03:55.533
but it's just prime
cattle country.

1:03:55.623 --> 1:03:57.113
And the fella
that owns the ranch now

1:03:57.208 --> 1:03:58.618
he's willing to sell.

1:04:02.255 --> 1:04:04.746
Maybe...

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:07.298
Maybe you'd like to take a look
at it after I buy it back.

1:04:09.137 --> 1:04:10.843
With the money you get for Ben?

1:04:10.930 --> 1:04:13.137
Oh, that's something else.
I'm talking to you now.

1:04:14.351 --> 1:04:15.966
Be like stepping on a grave.

1:04:17.937 --> 1:04:19.302
You know what I'm asking you?

1:04:21.441 --> 1:04:25.434
I can't say how I feel,
the way things are.

1:05:35.056 --> 1:05:36.466
Howard: Alright, get up.

1:05:43.356 --> 1:05:44.812
Come on, come on, get up.

1:06:02.208 --> 1:06:04.540
Come on. We're through
fooling with you.

1:06:06.921 --> 1:06:08.877
- Quit that!
- "Dead or alive," it says.

1:06:08.965 --> 1:06:10.626
Stop him!
Ben won't have a chance.

1:06:10.717 --> 1:06:12.332
Chance at what? To kill us all?

1:06:15.221 --> 1:06:17.837
Alright, if that's what you
want, I'll give him a chance.

1:06:17.932 --> 1:06:21.641
There. Now, cut him loose.

1:06:21.728 --> 1:06:23.138
Don't let him do it.

1:06:23.229 --> 1:06:24.469
Cut him loose!

1:06:30.195 --> 1:06:31.560
Alright, Ben.

1:06:33.656 --> 1:06:35.066
It ain't a fair fight, Howie.

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:38.650
My hands ain't fit.

1:06:43.041 --> 1:06:45.202
You're ready now, anytime.

1:06:45.293 --> 1:06:46.783
Howard: Come on, draw.

1:07:01.476 --> 1:07:05.560
I ain't got a prayer
against you, and you know it.

1:07:07.315 --> 1:07:08.771
It's your first move.

1:07:10.276 --> 1:07:13.313
If you're going
to murder me, Howie

1:07:13.404 --> 1:07:15.440
don't try to make it look
like something else.

1:07:17.784 --> 1:07:19.024
Come on, draw.

1:07:23.623 --> 1:07:24.783
Kill him!

1:07:40.265 --> 1:07:41.380
Alright.

1:07:44.435 --> 1:07:46.517
Leave it be.

1:07:46.604 --> 1:07:49.186
It's getting so I don't know
which way to point this no more.

1:07:50.692 --> 1:07:52.523
How many chances does he get?

1:07:52.610 --> 1:07:53.879
Is this part of your
deal with her?

1:07:53.903 --> 1:07:54.903
- I didn't...
- No, no.

1:07:54.946 --> 1:07:55.946
You didn't keep me busy

1:07:55.989 --> 1:07:57.274
while he's making his break.

1:07:58.616 --> 1:07:59.947
No, it just happened that way.

1:08:02.453 --> 1:08:03.818
It just happened that way.

1:08:54.672 --> 1:08:57.539
Well, this is no good.
You got any more shortcuts?

1:09:00.219 --> 1:09:01.779
Well, there's no sense
stewing about it.

1:09:01.804 --> 1:09:03.510
We got here late and that's it.

1:09:03.598 --> 1:09:05.868
That's the time you cost us.
If you'd listened to me we cou...

1:09:05.892 --> 1:09:07.870
Alright, I'll listen to you now
if you got any ideas

1:09:07.894 --> 1:09:09.134
about how to get across here.

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:10.809
No, we can't get across that.

1:09:10.897 --> 1:09:12.433
You gotta get downstream a ways.

1:09:12.523 --> 1:09:14.809
Howard: How far?
- Oh, four, five days.

1:09:14.901 --> 1:09:16.311
If we make time.

1:09:16.402 --> 1:09:18.814
We can swim it here,
so let's start now.

1:09:18.905 --> 1:09:20.816
I'll take the point
if you're afraid.

1:09:20.907 --> 1:09:22.772
At least I got the sense
to be afraid.

1:09:22.867 --> 1:09:24.357
Besides, what about her?

1:09:24.452 --> 1:09:26.534
She wouldn't last two minutes
in that current.

1:09:26.621 --> 1:09:29.454
You want to go downstream?
Take her with you.

1:09:29.540 --> 1:09:31.747
What if Ben gets washed away?
Then we got nothing.

1:09:33.002 --> 1:09:35.618
I bow to your superior wisdom.

1:09:35.713 --> 1:09:37.858
I promise you, Jesse, he'll get
across, one way or the other.

1:09:37.882 --> 1:09:39.318
Howard: Hey, wait a minute.
- Hey, you can't do that.

1:09:39.342 --> 1:09:40.736
I'll try the river,
but not like this.

1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:43.046
Yes, like this. Why not?

1:09:43.137 --> 1:09:45.423
We'll go downstream
before we cross.

1:09:48.226 --> 1:09:50.012
Now what are you worried about,
your girl?

1:09:50.103 --> 1:09:51.843
Don't tell me you're worried
about him.

1:09:56.901 --> 1:09:58.857
Why? It's no different
from the rope in abilene.

1:09:58.945 --> 1:10:00.464
You knew you were gonna
bring him back to die

1:10:00.488 --> 1:10:02.820
when you started after him.
You know that now.

1:10:02.907 --> 1:10:04.192
That hasn't changed.

1:10:04.283 --> 1:10:06.569
He's not a man,
he's a sack of money.

1:10:06.661 --> 1:10:08.743
That's why we're all here,
especially you.

1:10:08.830 --> 1:10:10.445
Why don't you face up to it?

1:12:07.907 --> 1:12:09.613
I don't suppose either
of you object

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:11.110
to stopping the night here.

1:12:13.788 --> 1:12:15.198
Ha! I didn't think so.

1:12:25.383 --> 1:12:27.544
Hey, Lina, honey

1:12:27.635 --> 1:12:29.000
it's my back again.

1:12:30.513 --> 1:12:32.003
Can you do me?

1:12:32.098 --> 1:12:34.259
Let me do you this time.

1:12:34.350 --> 1:12:36.136
Start fixing for a fire, girlie.

1:12:39.355 --> 1:12:40.720
How do you like your rubbing?

1:12:40.815 --> 1:12:42.396
Up and down or side to side?

1:12:42.483 --> 1:12:45.316
Hey, you don't have to do that.

1:12:45.403 --> 1:12:46.859
You better look after
your partners.

1:12:48.197 --> 1:12:49.983
Partners, huh?

1:12:50.074 --> 1:12:51.439
If I didn't need a grubstake

1:12:51.534 --> 1:12:54.321
I'd have walked out
on this deal long ago.

1:12:54.412 --> 1:12:56.573
It's too bad.

1:12:56.664 --> 1:12:58.529
If you'd been lucky
like my friend...

1:12:58.624 --> 1:13:00.831
And I've had about enough of
that, too.

1:13:00.918 --> 1:13:02.704
You got no friend found gold
around here

1:13:02.795 --> 1:13:04.660
you're talking about yourself.

1:13:04.755 --> 1:13:07.497
I knowed I shouldn't have shot
off my mouth in front of you.

1:13:07.592 --> 1:13:10.129
Quit playacting. You wanted me
to know it all along.

1:13:12.346 --> 1:13:13.631
So, let's get at it.

1:13:16.225 --> 1:13:17.886
You tell me where to dig

1:13:17.977 --> 1:13:20.343
and I'll see that your gal
is provided for.

1:13:20.438 --> 1:13:22.269
Don't try to horse-trade me,
Jesse.

1:13:22.356 --> 1:13:24.768
I ain't gonna tell you where my
gold is, but I'll show you.

1:13:27.904 --> 1:13:31.647
I knew that's what you been
scratching for all along.

1:13:31.741 --> 1:13:34.448
Trouble is, I don't trust you
no more than I trust them.

1:13:34.535 --> 1:13:37.242
Well, you don't have
to trust nobody.

1:13:37.330 --> 1:13:39.116
Even if you don't fancy
my gold mine

1:13:39.206 --> 1:13:41.288
you still got me
all to yourself.

1:13:41.375 --> 1:13:43.161
Now, that's saying I trust you.

1:13:43.252 --> 1:13:46.460
Say I tell you where my gold is,
you might still turn me in.

1:13:46.547 --> 1:13:48.412
If I make a deal, I stick by it.

1:13:53.804 --> 1:13:56.170
At least I wouldn't have any
partners to worry about.

1:13:56.265 --> 1:13:58.381
- Except me.
- What do you mean, you?

1:13:58.476 --> 1:14:02.060
If 1 did it, now just if,
it'd be an even swap.

1:14:02.146 --> 1:14:04.011
You go loose,
and I get the gold mine.

1:14:04.106 --> 1:14:05.391
Now, that ain't fair, Jesse

1:14:05.483 --> 1:14:07.144
I got a right to some
of that gold.

1:14:07.234 --> 1:14:09.520
Fair or no, its the only deal
I'd make.

1:14:12.114 --> 1:14:13.729
And it's a poor deal no matter.

1:15:08.170 --> 1:15:11.162
Same deal.
I'll trade you even up.

1:15:11.257 --> 1:15:14.795
Your neck for that gold,
yes or no?

1:15:14.885 --> 1:15:17.467
I ain't fixed for bargaining,
Jesse, you know that.

1:15:21.434 --> 1:15:25.097
Come on then,
I got two horses ready.

1:15:25.187 --> 1:15:26.472
I'll get Lina.

1:15:26.564 --> 1:15:29.772
No, she ain't part of the deal.

1:15:29.859 --> 1:15:31.019
She goes with me.

1:15:33.863 --> 1:15:37.026
If I'm gonna be broke,
I ain't gonna be lonesome.

1:15:39.994 --> 1:15:41.700
Get her up, then.

1:15:41.787 --> 1:15:43.869
Remember, I'm watching you.

1:15:54.091 --> 1:15:56.002
Shh! Shhh!

1:15:56.093 --> 1:15:58.755
I'll tell you later. Come on.

1:16:25.873 --> 1:16:28.205
Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake!

1:16:29.460 --> 1:16:30.916
Where? Where?

1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:35.292
Huh! Whoa! Ben, hey.

1:16:39.303 --> 1:16:41.214
Fun's over.
Get down off that horse.

1:16:42.515 --> 1:16:44.676
I said off, come on, move.

1:16:44.767 --> 1:16:46.223
You alright, honey?

1:16:46.310 --> 1:16:49.268
You got the gun.
What do you care?

1:16:49.355 --> 1:16:50.390
You're alright.

1:16:51.315 --> 1:16:52.680
Get moving.

1:16:54.401 --> 1:16:56.141
I got it coming.

1:16:56.237 --> 1:16:58.899
Do business with the devil
and you'll get it every time.

1:16:58.989 --> 1:17:01.321
Ain't it the truth?

1:17:01.408 --> 1:17:03.899
Get going. Lina, honey,
you take the horse.

1:17:11.377 --> 1:17:12.537
Ben: Hold it, Jesse.

1:17:16.966 --> 1:17:18.251
You better get going, Ben.

1:17:18.342 --> 1:17:19.862
The other two will
be along any minute.

1:17:19.927 --> 1:17:22.714
You mean, we better get going,
don't you, honey?

1:17:22.805 --> 1:17:25.842
If it suits you,
I'll settle for going.

1:17:25.933 --> 1:17:29.676
I don't fancy your friend
with a gun in his hand.

1:17:29.770 --> 1:17:33.308
'Course, I don't suppose Ben
would be fool enough to shoot.

1:17:33.399 --> 1:17:35.811
It'd be heard 20 mile or more.

1:17:35.901 --> 1:17:38.313
Who's talking about shooting?

1:17:38.404 --> 1:17:41.271
Leave him with the burro, Ben,
you don't need him. Please.

1:17:42.324 --> 1:17:44.485
I'm just thinking that...

1:17:44.577 --> 1:17:47.034
From up there,
a man could pick off anything

1:17:47.121 --> 1:17:48.531
that moves in this clearing.

1:17:49.999 --> 1:17:52.331
The only trouble is...

1:17:52.418 --> 1:17:54.454
There's nothing to stop a man.

1:17:54.545 --> 1:17:58.003
Make him hold up for a while.

1:17:58.090 --> 1:18:02.254
Ben, I got to talk a different
way now, I know that.

1:18:02.344 --> 1:18:03.550
But that gold mine still ain't

1:18:03.637 --> 1:18:05.798
gonna do you much good.
I'm thinking...

1:18:05.890 --> 1:18:08.097
Thinking is your weak spot,
Jesse.

1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:13.476
Here, Lina, hold the horses.
Leave the burro.

1:18:22.573 --> 1:18:24.359
Ben! Ben! No!

1:18:28.287 --> 1:18:31.324
You had no reason to kill him.
He couldn't hurt you none.

1:18:31.415 --> 1:18:32.780
Ben: Leave him lay like that.

1:18:34.752 --> 1:18:37.038
They'll come after you sure now.

1:18:37.129 --> 1:18:38.585
That shot will bring them.

1:18:38.672 --> 1:18:40.879
- And they'll finish you.
- I figure they'll come.

1:18:40.966 --> 1:18:43.878
Now get those horses
on the other side of that rock.

1:18:43.969 --> 1:18:45.755
Come on, do as I say,
before I have to knock

1:18:45.846 --> 1:18:47.131
some sense into you.

1:19:23.175 --> 1:19:24.415
Up here.

1:19:46.740 --> 1:19:47.855
Get down.

1:19:50.661 --> 1:19:53.448
Better not move around
too much up here.

1:19:53.539 --> 1:19:55.154
Come on, you too.

1:19:58.210 --> 1:20:01.293
I swear, he ain't half as
worried over it as you are.

1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:02.540
Look at him.

1:20:06.051 --> 1:20:07.791
Lying there peaceful in the sun.

1:20:09.138 --> 1:20:11.504
He ain't never gonna
be hungry again.

1:20:11.598 --> 1:20:13.964
Never want anything
he can't have.

1:20:14.059 --> 1:20:15.299
That's more than we can say.

1:20:16.895 --> 1:20:18.635
Oh!

1:20:18.731 --> 1:20:21.814
Hold still. Hold still.

1:20:21.900 --> 1:20:23.561
You're gonna be still
from now on.

1:20:23.652 --> 1:20:25.612
I ain't been harder on you
'cause I know you never

1:20:25.696 --> 1:20:27.277
seen a man killed close up.

1:20:27.364 --> 1:20:28.854
Well, that'll pass.

1:20:28.949 --> 1:20:30.135
Day after tomorrow,
it'll be just

1:20:30.159 --> 1:20:31.615
like a story you once heard.

1:20:31.702 --> 1:20:34.819
You killed that man
in abilene like kemp said!

1:20:34.913 --> 1:20:38.030
Just another gun I'll never have
to look into, you understand?

1:20:38.125 --> 1:20:41.413
Pretty soon, Roy and your
friend Howie are gonna show up.

1:20:41.503 --> 1:20:45.246
Then I'll get me some more
insurance against dying young.

1:20:45.341 --> 1:20:48.128
Ben, we can get away.
California. We can go there.

1:20:48.218 --> 1:20:49.863
You always said you'd
take me to California.

1:20:49.887 --> 1:20:51.502
Might go to California.

1:20:51.597 --> 1:20:53.533
Kemp didn't kill you when
he had the chance, remember?

1:20:53.557 --> 1:20:54.672
You got to remember that.

1:20:54.767 --> 1:20:56.348
I remember what suits me.

1:20:56.435 --> 1:20:57.454
If you forget this,
I won't ever do anything

1:20:57.478 --> 1:20:58.843
you don't want, I promise.

1:20:58.937 --> 1:20:59.956
I won't talk, I won't
do anything wrong...

1:20:59.980 --> 1:21:01.686
Of course, you won't, honey.

1:21:01.774 --> 1:21:04.891
I decided how it was gonna be
with us when I took you in.

1:21:07.780 --> 1:21:09.941
Boys must be having trouble
finding their way.

1:21:18.582 --> 1:21:20.698
Ain't lost my touch.

1:21:20.793 --> 1:21:22.374
Think I'll try for a pair.

1:21:29.134 --> 1:21:31.466
Quiet now. Here they come.

1:22:06.004 --> 1:22:07.369
That's better, Howie.

1:22:08.799 --> 1:22:10.084
Stand together, boys.

1:24:14.967 --> 1:24:16.173
Howie!

1:24:21.014 --> 1:24:23.346
Lina's hurt bad.

1:24:23.433 --> 1:24:26.550
Ben: Caught a ricochet.
She's bleeding something awful.

1:24:26.645 --> 1:24:28.681
How about a truce
so I can fix her up?

1:24:30.190 --> 1:24:31.475
Ben: What do you say, Howie?

1:25:47.351 --> 1:25:48.591
Lina!

1:25:51.855 --> 1:25:54.096
Lina, are you alright?

1:25:55.275 --> 1:25:56.515
I didn't know what to do.

1:25:57.944 --> 1:25:59.275
Where is... Roy: Kemp!

1:27:09.975 --> 1:27:11.761
Roy! Roy!

1:27:13.145 --> 1:27:15.511
I got him! I got him!

1:27:15.605 --> 1:27:17.470
Come in alone,
we'll pull him in after!

1:27:27.075 --> 1:27:28.315
Stop it!

1:27:28.410 --> 1:27:30.196
Ben's dead. Ain't that enough?

1:27:44.426 --> 1:27:45.426
Look!

1:27:50.974 --> 1:27:52.635
Look out! Let go of him!

1:27:53.810 --> 1:27:55.050
Lina® look out!

1:28:33.934 --> 1:28:35.140
Cut him loose, Howie.

1:28:35.227 --> 1:28:36.967
I'm taking him back.

1:28:37.062 --> 1:28:39.303
This is what I came
after and now I got it.

1:28:39.397 --> 1:28:41.388
No partners like I started.

1:28:43.109 --> 1:28:45.100
He's gonna pay for my land.

1:28:45.195 --> 1:28:47.857
Lina: Jesse, and Roy, and him...

1:28:47.948 --> 1:28:50.109
Howard: They're dead! Finished!

1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:52.316
Ben's not dead
if you take him back.

1:28:52.410 --> 1:28:54.571
He'll never be dead for you.

1:28:54.663 --> 1:28:56.494
I don't care anything
about that but money.

1:28:56.581 --> 1:28:58.768
That's all I care about. That's
all I've ever cared about.

1:28:58.792 --> 1:29:01.249
Roy, he called the turn.
He said, "face up to it."

1:29:01.336 --> 1:29:03.952
Alright, that's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm doing!

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:06.830
Maybe I don't fit your ideas
of me,

1:29:06.925 --> 1:29:08.961
but that's the way I am.

1:29:15.350 --> 1:29:18.513
Alright, if that's the way
you want it, I'll ride with you.

1:29:18.603 --> 1:29:20.264
I'll ride with you all the way.

1:29:20.355 --> 1:29:21.355
I'm taking him back.

1:29:21.398 --> 1:29:24.356
I know. I'll marry you.

1:29:24.442 --> 1:29:27.684
I'll go with you, I'll even
live on that land with you.

1:29:27.779 --> 1:29:29.485
What else do you want from me?

1:29:30.282 --> 1:29:31.522
Why?

1:29:33.410 --> 1:29:34.525
Tell me why?

1:29:35.787 --> 1:29:37.618
I'm taking him back, I swear it.

1:29:40.041 --> 1:29:42.157
I'm gonna sell him for money.

1:30:34.804 --> 1:30:36.590
Howard: You still want
to try California?

1:30:37.974 --> 1:30:39.134
Lina: If you want.

1:30:40.852 --> 1:30:42.012
That's it, then.

1:30:48.985 --> 1:30:51.067
I'll fix some of Jesse's
coffee for you.
