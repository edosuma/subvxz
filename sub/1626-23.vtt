WEBVTT

00:01.368 --> 00:04.403
Okay, chestnut,
it's time to play that game

00:04.405 --> 00:06.972
Where we take shots
while we pay our bills

00:06.974 --> 00:10.542
That max so cleverly named,
"that game where we take shots

00:10.544 --> 00:12.778
While we pay our bills."

00:12.780 --> 00:14.446
Hey, if you want me
to think of a better name,

00:14.448 --> 00:16.248
We should probably stop
taking shots

00:16.250 --> 00:17.983
While we pay our bills.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.753
If this bill says
first warning,

00:20.755 --> 00:22.921
We take a shot,
and chestnut gets a carrot.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.590
If it's a final notice,

00:24.592 --> 00:26.658
Chestnut gets two carrots,
and we take a double shot.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.727
And if it's gone
into collections,

00:28.729 --> 00:31.897
We shoot ourselves,
and chestnut gets three carrots.

00:31.899 --> 00:35.100
And also, I'm gonna take shots
whenever I want to.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.002
All right,
only a couple bills to go

00:37.004 --> 00:38.971
And $149 to pay them.

00:38.973 --> 00:41.006
That's an odd number.
Shots!

00:44.110 --> 00:46.912
Man, our electric bill
is $72.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.214
That's an even number.
Shots!

00:51.851 --> 00:53.919
Next up,
I have gas.

00:53.921 --> 00:57.189
Ah, thanks for the heads-up
this time.

00:57.191 --> 01:01.427
We have $77,
and the bill's only $76.84.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.263
Numbers!
Shots!

01:04.265 --> 01:06.432
This is the first time
we've ever broken even.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.200
Wait, what do we do
when we break even?

01:08.202 --> 01:10.936
Shots?

01:10.938 --> 01:13.038

Hey, everybody.

02:06.926 --> 02:08.427
Big news.

02:08.429 --> 02:12.097
I finally met the man
of my dreams.

02:12.099 --> 02:15.267
Sophie, that's not news.
You've known me for years.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.903
Oh, earl,
another place,

02:17.905 --> 02:19.705

02:21.442 --> 02:24.409
Hey, girls, you better
wipe down my booth.

02:24.411 --> 02:27.045
My boyfriend's parking
his lincoln outside.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.681
Yeah, he dropped me off first
'cause he's a class act

02:29.683 --> 02:34.453
And 'cause he had
to put his pants back on.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.890
There she is.
There's my peanut.

02:37.892 --> 02:42.394
You hear that?
He calls me his peanut.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.296
Holy crap, she's looking
even prettier

02:44.298 --> 02:46.231
Than the last time
I saw her.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.599
What'd you do,

02:47.601 --> 02:49.201
Get some beauty creams
on the way from the car

02:49.203 --> 02:50.435
To the diner?

02:50.437 --> 02:51.703
[laughs and gasps]

02:51.705 --> 02:54.406
Oh, maybe.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.376
Sophie, it's nice to see you
so giddy about something.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.378
Yeah, you're like me
sitting on that broken washer

02:59.380 --> 03:01.613
At the laundromat.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.349
I'm nicky,
but my friends call me

03:04.351 --> 03:07.286
When they need money.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.620
[laughs]

03:08.622 --> 03:09.988
I'm caroline.
This is max.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.356
I'm gonna ask you
the same question

03:11.358 --> 03:12.991
I ask every guy
around your age.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.494
Are you my dad?

03:15.496 --> 03:16.895
Maybe one of you dolls
can get me

03:16.897 --> 03:19.331
A glass of water
to wash down my tums?

03:19.333 --> 03:22.401
Sexy
and he has an ulcer.

03:22.403 --> 03:25.337
Sure, I'll go get you
some menus and the wine list.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.672
Don't get excited.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.040
That's just a list
of everything

03:28.042 --> 03:30.676
Caroline's whined about
in the last year.

03:30.678 --> 03:35.080
What's up with robert de zero
over there?

03:35.082 --> 03:37.049
I used to have
a leather jacket like that.

03:37.051 --> 03:40.686
Then I realized, when you have
the right to bear arms,

03:40.688 --> 03:44.089
You bare them, baby.

03:44.091 --> 03:47.159
Omelet.
Pick up.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.661
I think
oleg just got jealous.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.230
I think oleg
just got underarm dandruff

03:51.232 --> 03:53.265
In these eggs.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.667
Enjoy.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.236
Here are your menus,

03:57.238 --> 03:58.503
And we're out
of everything

03:58.505 --> 03:59.938
In the pictures
since 1974.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.974
So the little girl smiling
eating a waffle,

04:01.976 --> 04:06.645
She's a grandma now,
and she calls penn station home.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.114
Here you go, dolls,
for your trouble.

04:09.116 --> 04:13.185
100 bucks?
It's like free money.

04:13.187 --> 04:14.820
Can you imagine
what he would've given us

04:14.822 --> 04:17.356
If the glasses
were clean?

04:17.358 --> 04:19.524
All this money
and I didn't even do anything.

04:19.526 --> 04:24.029
I'm one mustache away
from being a kardashian.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.131
Yeah, nicky's
a big-shot bookie

04:26.133 --> 04:27.866
With a yorkie
and a membership

04:27.868 --> 04:30.269
To the vip lounge
at the race track.

04:30.271 --> 04:33.005
A yorkie
and a green leather jacket?

04:33.007 --> 04:35.440
Are you even real?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.842
I love horse racing.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.443
I used to go
to the track all the time,

04:38.445 --> 04:41.380
And not to brag,
but I do own a thoroughbred.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.881
Oh, yeah, she does.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.783
I see it eating
out of the garbage can

04:44.785 --> 04:47.152
From my window.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.221
Here, that's chestnut.

04:49.223 --> 04:51.690
That's a beauty,
but not as much a beauty

04:51.692 --> 04:53.659
As my peanut right here.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.961
Oh, he just compared me
to a horse,

04:55.963 --> 05:00.299
But I like it anyway.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.700
Why don't
you two dolls join us

05:01.702 --> 05:03.735
At the track's turf club
some afternoon?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.937
Oh, we're busy,
and it's all the way out in--

05:05.939 --> 05:07.205
Are you paying?

05:07.207 --> 05:08.440
Of course.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.708
Oh, then we're there.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.443
In fact,
can we go right now?

05:11.445 --> 05:13.779
Yeah, we're
not doing anything.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.222
Max, look,
the turf club.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.557
Us way up here,

05:25.559 --> 05:26.958
The horses down there
on the track

05:26.960 --> 05:29.328
Being forced
into their starting gates.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.729
This is so exciting.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.565
[sings <i>first call]</i>

05:33.567 --> 05:35.500
Girl, we've been here
30 seconds,

05:35.502 --> 05:37.602
And you already blew
your bugle.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.838
Pace yourself.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.106
Max, caroline,

05:41.108 --> 05:43.909
Over here!

05:43.911 --> 05:45.644
Wow, I haven't seen
sophie this happy

05:45.646 --> 05:47.112
Since that girl
slipped on the ice

05:47.114 --> 05:49.281
In front
of our building.

05:49.283 --> 05:52.484
That girl was me, max,

05:52.486 --> 05:54.786
And I really hurt
my coccyx.

05:54.788 --> 05:58.423
You have a coccyx?
You want to go out sometime?

05:58.425 --> 05:59.925
Hey, girls.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.427
Come on, peanut.
Get a little closer to me.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.029
Closer.
Little closer.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.331
Closer.
Little closer.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.334
What can I say, girls?
I can't get close enough.

06:09.336 --> 06:13.004
Do you hear that?
He can't get close enough.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.773
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.008
It feels great to be back
at the track again.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.577
Ah, horse racing is,
after all,

06:18.579 --> 06:19.945
The sport of kings.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.279
I'm more interested
in the sport

06:21.281 --> 06:23.615
Of king crab legs
right over there.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.884
So is this
an all-you-can-eat deal here,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.686
Or will a waiter
come drag me away?

06:27.688 --> 06:29.020
Knock yourself out.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.189
How much could a girl
like you possibly eat?

06:31.191 --> 06:33.191
You know how
a cobra can swallow

06:33.193 --> 06:37.262
An entire pig?

06:37.264 --> 06:38.730
It's like that.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.900
Hey, caroline,
you want two or three?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.468
So max tells me
you met

06:43.470 --> 06:46.405
At 24 hour fitness
24 hours ago.

06:46.407 --> 06:51.743
Yup, he spotted me
in a handstand.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.578
Nicky, who am I
gonna bet on?

06:53.580 --> 06:57.549
Who do you like,
besides me?

06:57.551 --> 06:58.784
Sophie,
go with mess in a dress.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.285
She had great
morning sprints,

07:00.287 --> 07:01.620
First-time blinkers,

07:01.622 --> 07:03.021
Jockey weighed in
a pound under,

07:03.023 --> 07:04.289
And at the preakness,

07:04.291 --> 07:05.857
She was second
in seven furlongs,

07:05.859 --> 07:07.492
And this race
is only six furlongs.

07:07.494 --> 07:09.861
Yeah, you're talking
for long.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.697
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna go with number three,

07:12.699 --> 07:13.999
My uncle hank.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.233
My uncle hank?

07:15.235 --> 07:16.968
He's out of jail?

07:16.970 --> 07:18.303
Yeah, we should
probably eat this

07:18.305 --> 07:20.138
And head out.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.473
Oh, see,
that's my horse.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.041
My horse, uncle hank.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.143
And look, see?
He just pooped.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.878
He's trying
to get away from it.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.247
I know about that.
That's how I am.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.251
Okay, got to make
the donuts, but first,

07:33.253 --> 07:34.853
Give me
that kisses, sister.

07:34.855 --> 07:38.056
Aw, so romantic.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.058
Max, maybe we should get in
on the action.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.428
Nah, that's a lot
of tongue for me.

07:43.430 --> 07:46.264
No, I meant place a bet.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.701
And, max,
I think I'm in a three-way.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.837
Well, you look exactly
the way I imagined

07:51.839 --> 07:55.073
You'd look
in a three-way--reading.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.210
Come on,
we have that free money,

07:58.212 --> 08:00.011
And you love to gamble.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.782
Yeah, but nothing stupid,
just, like, not using a condom.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.951
Oh, what the hell?

08:05.953 --> 08:07.686
Wait, wait,
nicky, nicky, here.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.121
Here's your money.
200 on mess in a dress.

08:10.123 --> 08:15.026
Oh, wait, I think
I have a mess in my dress.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.329
You got it, doll,
and I'm sending over

08:17.331 --> 08:19.164
Some of those
special popovers.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.534
Sophie, make sure
you get one.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.636
Oh, do you hear that?

08:24.638 --> 08:29.274
There's gonna be a ring
in one of those popovers.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.876
I didn't hear
any of that.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.978
Well, why else would
someone order popovers

08:32.980 --> 08:36.047
Unless they were gonna
hide a ring in it?

08:36.049 --> 08:39.684
I just ate the entire cast
of   <i>finding ne.</i>

08:39.686 --> 08:41.219
I'm not saying I'm sick.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.122
I'm just saying
that clown fish wants out.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.791
Afternoon, ladies.
Enjoy the popovers.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.494
And are you finished
with that?

08:49.496 --> 08:51.997
Ah, let's just say
it's finished with me.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.398
(track announcer)
and they're off.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.666
This is so exciting.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.535
I know.
I wonder which one it's in.

08:56.537 --> 09:00.205
Oh.
Oh, not that one.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.108
All right.
Whoops, not that one.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.643
Look, look,
there's our horse,

09:04.645 --> 09:05.977
Mess in a dress.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.312
She's in the lead.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.881
Oh, no,
not that one.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.116
Yes, yes, yes.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.751
No, no, no.

09:12.753 --> 09:13.985
(track announcer)
and the winner is

09:13.987 --> 09:15.253
Mess in a dress.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.488
[both shout]

09:16.490 --> 09:17.956
We won!
We won.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.125
Are we being winners
right now?

09:20.127 --> 09:21.793
I don't know
how to be that.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.262
Suddenly I don't know
what to do with my hands.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.630
Nothing.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.632
I mean, who in the hell
would order popovers

09:27.634 --> 09:30.835
And not hide
a diamond ring in it?

09:30.837 --> 09:34.573
Here you go, dolls.
6 big ones.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.676
Max, this is
incredible.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.278
We had 200,
and now we have 600.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.513
Even more free money.

09:41.515 --> 09:44.182
[sings <i>first call]</i>

09:44.184 --> 09:46.151
And, waiter,
bring my peanut

09:46.153 --> 09:49.321
One of those
banana splits.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.089
You hear that?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.425
There's a diamond ring
in the bottom

09:53.427 --> 09:55.527
Of the banana split.

09:55.529 --> 09:57.862
And, leon,
for your trouble.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.364
Really? 100?

09:59.366 --> 10:02.367
Yup, I was a waitress
before I was rich.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.835
And also
after that fish,

10:03.837 --> 10:06.371
I might need you
to carry me to the subway.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.387
Whoever that is
going through my pants,

10:22.389 --> 10:23.955
You should know
I have a gun.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.857
Max, it's me,
caroline.

10:25.859 --> 10:29.461
Why do you think
I bought the gun?

10:29.463 --> 10:30.996
Okay, max,
you know how today

10:30.998 --> 10:34.299
We won 600 on our 200
after just that one horse race?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.001
Yeah, that was weird,
but not as weird

10:36.003 --> 10:37.802
As waking up to see you
standing in the dark

10:37.804 --> 10:39.671
Going to third base
with my pants.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.140
If I bet our winnings
with the three-to-one odds

10:42.142 --> 10:43.408
On this horse tomorrow,

10:43.410 --> 10:45.176
Do you know how much
I can make us?

10:45.178 --> 10:47.045
Let's see.
2, carry the 1--

10:47.047 --> 10:48.346
Get out.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.849
I have the racing form
right back here.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.018
Don't bring that over here.
That's been in your crack.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.386
See?
Right here.

10:54.388 --> 10:55.987
First race tomorrow--
there she blows.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.722
If she's blowing
that early in the morning,

10:57.724 --> 10:59.858
She deserves our money.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.426
I've done
all the research

11:01.428 --> 11:02.994
And checked it
with chestnut.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.096
It's a sure thing,
like the sun coming up tomorrow

11:05.098 --> 11:06.498
Or that somali pirate

11:06.500 --> 11:09.300
Never getting another
acting job again.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.836
You go out and get addicted
to horse racing

11:11.838 --> 11:13.271
After I worked so hard

11:13.273 --> 11:15.306
To put pills and weed
on the table?

11:15.308 --> 11:18.943
I am not addicted.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.478
Now, where's your cash?

11:20.480 --> 11:21.913
'cause it wasn't
in your piggy bank,

11:21.915 --> 11:23.982
Which someone--
not me--broke.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.350
You think
you don't have a problem?

11:25.352 --> 11:26.785
Then, fine, you can
have the money.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.319
You won't be sorry.
Where is it?

11:28.321 --> 11:29.587
In my bra.

11:29.589 --> 11:30.855
Where's your bra?

11:30.857 --> 11:32.490
On my boobs.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.092
You sleep in your bra?

11:34.094 --> 11:35.360
Have to.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.761
Last time I let them
out at night,

11:36.763 --> 11:38.363
They didn't come home
till 4 a.M.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.932
And couldn't tell me
where they'd been.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.600
Max, just take it
out of there, please.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.536
Nope, I'll tell you
what I tell every guy

11:44.538 --> 11:46.204
Who wants
to get in there.

11:46.206 --> 11:50.275
It's 12 bucks for adults
and 10.50 for seniors.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.043
Fine, I'm doing this
for both of us.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.014
Still think you don't
have a problem?

11:57.850 --> 11:59.150
Geez, where is it?

11:59.152 --> 12:01.219
Is there a map
or a tour guide?

12:01.221 --> 12:04.456
Coming up on your left.
You're about 20 minutes away.

12:04.458 --> 12:07.592
It's quite a walk.
You might want to take the tram.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.927
Got it.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.462
Feel good
about yourself?

12:10.464 --> 12:12.697
I will after
that race tomorrow.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.532
And I promise
I'll never do that again.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.102
That's what
my uncle hank said.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.704
No, I meant I'll never
ask you for money again.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.740
That's what
uncle hank's wife said.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.974
No more gambling.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.576
Now I feel like
you read the transcript

12:24.578 --> 12:26.144
Of uncle hank's case.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.313
Oh, wait,
you forgot some.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.548
Just kidding, it's late,
and it felt kind of good.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.090
Max, I hope caroline
gets here soon,

12:39.092 --> 12:42.227
'cause if that girl
walks in one full hour late,

12:42.229 --> 12:44.496
I'll have to respect
the hell out of her.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.397
She's still
at the track,

12:46.399 --> 12:48.666
And I'm dying to know
how our horse did.

12:48.668 --> 12:49.968
So much suspense.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.270
I feel like I should be
peeing on a stick.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.439
You girls are still playing
the horses.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.740
Keep that in check.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.475
My gambling problem
got so bad

12:57.477 --> 12:59.978
I couldn't even afford
my drug problem.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.382
You're back!
So how did we do?

13:04.384 --> 13:05.717
We did great.

13:05.719 --> 13:06.985
We won our bet
on there she blows.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.520
Yes!
How much did we get?

13:08.522 --> 13:12.023
Are we talking
"add avocado" money?

13:12.025 --> 13:16.094
Well, we did do great,
and then we did not great.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.697
And then we did bad,
and then we did real bad.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.233
And then we did terrible.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.701
Long story short,
I'm out of tums,

13:23.703 --> 13:26.037
And we owe nicky $3,000.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.907
You--you owe nicky.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.542
When I got addicted
to pizza pringles,

13:30.544 --> 13:32.710
I didn't make it
your problem.

13:32.712 --> 13:36.881
Your breath made it
all our problems.

13:36.883 --> 13:39.384
Max, nicky's not,
like, dangerous, is he?

13:39.386 --> 13:41.386
I bet he's not,
but even if he is,

13:41.388 --> 13:42.620
Don't worry.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.189
You can survive
in the trunk of lincoln

13:44.191 --> 13:46.191
For five,
six days easy.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.059
Max, I know I can make
all of this money back

13:48.061 --> 13:49.460
If I just win
one more race.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.962
I just need
a sure thing.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.431
There is no such thing
as a sure thing,

13:53.433 --> 13:56.634
Except my mother never
picking me up from school.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.369
Look, there are
two horses tomorrow

13:58.371 --> 14:00.071
That look really good,

14:00.073 --> 14:03.208
Buck that
and little house on the gary.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.610
Little house on the gary--
that's my friend eddie's horse.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.011
We don't have time
to pretend

14:07.013 --> 14:08.980
You have a friend
named eddie right now.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.548
I do.
Eddie jones.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.617
He's a famous jockey.
We met at the tailor.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.852
We got to talking

14:13.854 --> 14:15.954
As we were both
having our jeans hemmed.

14:15.956 --> 14:19.224
Where'd you buy them,
jc puny?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.558
Han, please,
you have to help me.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.026
You have to talk
to your friend eddie

14:22.028 --> 14:23.561
And get me the scoop
on the race tomorrow.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.630
Okay, I'll help
on one condition:

14:25.632 --> 14:27.398
No more short jokes
from max.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.967
She can do that.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.335
You can do that, right, max?
Don't answer.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.636
So no more
short jokes starting right--

14:31.638 --> 14:33.071
Okay, wait,
but first,

14:33.073 --> 14:35.206
Didn't I see you
on a baby food jar?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.908
A mouse set a trap
for you.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.977
And don't you have
to bring a ring to mordor?

14:43.349 --> 14:44.983
Okay, let's do this.

14:47.519 --> 14:49.520
Eddie said
he'd meet us down here.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.256
Han, I really
appreciate this.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.157
You're doing me
such a big, big favor.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.159
Yeah, and we're surprised
you can do anything big.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.861
Okay, that's it.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.096
Han, wait.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.597
I don't need it!

14:59.599 --> 15:01.499
Max, see what you did?

15:01.501 --> 15:02.800
What?
I was on autopilot.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.670
What did I say?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.939
Han, please,
max won't say anything.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.574
Good, 'cause I've had it
up to here.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.843
You don't have it
up to there.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.778
Don't need it!

15:13.780 --> 15:15.313
Max!

15:15.315 --> 15:16.948
Please, you have to
stop with the short jokes.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.182
This is my life.

15:18.184 --> 15:20.318
But that's my life.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.920
Keep it up,
and I'm gonna be at the bottom

15:21.922 --> 15:23.288
Of the east river

15:23.290 --> 15:24.856
With that hipster
artisan cheese truck

15:24.858 --> 15:26.291
You pushed off
the brooklyn bridge.

15:26.293 --> 15:29.027
You're right.
No more short jokes.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.300
Maybe I should wait
outside.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.634
So, han,
where's eddie?

15:36.636 --> 15:38.136
I think we should
talk to him

15:38.138 --> 15:40.772
As quickly as possible
before max passes out.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.675
I don't see him.
I'm sure he'll be here shortly.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.277
And I just bit
the inside of my mouth.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.845
Hey, it's han!

15:47.847 --> 15:50.949
I haven't seen you
since we took our little trip.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.550
No, man, I saw you
after my small business

15:52.552 --> 15:55.553
Owners softball game.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.323
Hey, I got new car,
a mini cooper.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.658
This is hell.
I'm in hell.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.460
Hey, is there anything
you can tell me

16:02.462 --> 16:03.728
About today's race?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.029
Is there a sure thing?

16:05.031 --> 16:06.864
Oh, you get yourself
a bad bet?

16:06.866 --> 16:09.233
Bad bet and beyond.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.468
Well, let me give you
a little tip.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.170
I'll be outside.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.543
(track announcer)
and coming down

16:18.545 --> 16:19.911
The home stretch,
little house on the gary

16:19.913 --> 16:21.245
Has the lead.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.580
Come on,
little house on the gary!

16:22.582 --> 16:24.048
Run! Run like caroline
after sundown

16:24.050 --> 16:26.617
In an ethnic neighborhood.

16:26.619 --> 16:30.788
The hoof, the hoof,
the hoof is on fire!

16:30.790 --> 16:32.623
He's winning.
He's winning.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.891
He's winning!

16:33.893 --> 16:35.827
Oh, no,
what's happening?

16:35.829 --> 16:37.161
He's falling behind.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.697
Oh, lord.
Oh, my sweet, sweet lord.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.899
He's losing.
He's losing.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.802
He's losing.
Han, what is happening?

16:44.804 --> 16:48.039
Well, maybe
I'll take off.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.141
Your friend said
it was a sure thing.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.376
There is no sure thing

16:51.378 --> 16:54.012
Except another
taylor swift breakup song.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.646
(announcer)
and little house on the gary

16:55.648 --> 17:00.218
Falls to pieces
as falls to pieces wins.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.320
So what do we win
if our horse finishes last

17:02.322 --> 17:06.391
And wanders around the track
with a giant erection?

17:06.393 --> 17:08.726
All that
and we lost?

17:08.728 --> 17:11.829
Thanks for lunch.

17:11.831 --> 17:15.566
Han, you're so small
your house is a tic tac box.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.635
You're so small
you ride in your car cupholder.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.903
You're so small
your parents

17:18.905 --> 17:21.305
Are a ladybug
and a tater tot.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.975
I could see that,
actually.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.877
I don't need it!

17:28.647 --> 17:30.114
You see, caroline?

17:30.116 --> 17:32.450
This is why
I quit gambling,

17:32.452 --> 17:36.154
This and the escalator
was always broken.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.656
All right,
let's just calm down.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.992
This is the turf club,
not <i>goodfellas,</i>

17:40.994 --> 17:42.693
Though that was placed
on real-life events

17:42.695 --> 17:44.929
And took place
not that far from here.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.931
Right, and maybe
he won't be so hard on us.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.533
Nicky is sophie's boyfriend.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.935
Well, I just broke up
with nicky.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.303
Why?

17:52.305 --> 17:53.871
I just saw him
beat the crap

17:53.873 --> 17:58.209
Out of some guy
that owed him money.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.744
Oh, no,
here he comes.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.451
There you are, dolls.

18:06.453 --> 18:09.220
My leg is next.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.255
Tough break.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.191
I'm gonna take
my 3 grand and go.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.592
Peanut just broke up
with me,

18:14.594 --> 18:16.294
So I'm gonna go home
and get in bed

18:16.296 --> 18:19.864
With my dog
and my wife.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.233
I have to come clean.
We don't have your money.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.601
I got out of control.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.304
Doll, relax.
I'm a reasonable man.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.039
We can work out
something.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.574
Oh, good.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.975
Hope he shoots me first.

18:30.977 --> 18:34.112
I'd rather be dead
than hear you beg.

18:34.114 --> 18:37.081
Still got
that thoroughbred?

18:37.083 --> 18:41.119
I'll come by tomorrow
to get it.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.820
He can't take my horse.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.088
What am I gonna do?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.423
You can always
move to new york

18:45.425 --> 18:46.657
And change
your name to max.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.259
Wait, I already
did that.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.561
What is wrong
with me?

18:50.563 --> 18:51.929
I should have known better.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.231
My father has problems
with money.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.732
It's in my dna.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.667
And now all because
of a stupid bet,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.402
I'm gonna lose
chestnut.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.937
If it makes you
feel any better,

18:59.939 --> 19:02.073
My mom once lost me
in a bet.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.374
Still can't believe
she thought

19:03.376 --> 19:06.344
Robert redford
was in <i>tootsie.</i>

19:06.346 --> 19:07.812
We can't lose
chestnut.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.481
Damn it, damn it,
damn it, people.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.716
Make me come
out of retirement

19:11.718 --> 19:13.584
Just save
your gambling asses.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.021
Now, all I need
is 100 bucks.

19:17.023 --> 19:20.324
Hey, caroline, how fast
can you have a baby?

19:20.326 --> 19:22.360
Hey.
Hi, leon.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.262
Remember us, the ones
who tipped you 100 bucks?

19:24.264 --> 19:25.730
Oh, of course,
it's hard to find

19:25.732 --> 19:27.398
That kind of generosity
in this place.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.067
It gives you hope again.

19:30.069 --> 19:33.237
Yeah, we're gonna
need that back.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.273
Well, actually,
I need all my money.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.741
I support my mother.

19:36.743 --> 19:40.077
Yeah,
maybe not today.

19:43.949 --> 19:45.750
Max, I can't
believe it.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.686
I screwed me and
the horse I rode in on.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.857
Why don't you film that
and get your money back?

19:52.859 --> 19:55.927
[gasps]
caroline, look.

19:55.929 --> 19:58.462
Earl, you did it.
You saved chestnut.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.598
Yeah, well,
we brown studs

20:00.600 --> 20:03.100
Have to stick together.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.970
And I'll take that.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.472
And since I don't
trust myself,

20:08.474 --> 20:11.709
I'm donating this 200
to my favorite charity,

20:11.711 --> 20:13.945
So here.

20:13.947 --> 20:17.381
Now, no more betting,

20:17.383 --> 20:19.984
'cause the only sure thing
in life is death.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.353
Have a nice day.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.796
One for you,
and one for me.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.798
200, we're back
to our free money,

20:33.800 --> 20:35.066
And this time,
it's going right

20:35.068 --> 20:36.734
In the savings account.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.103
Well, it's not earning
much interest in there.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.605
Here.

20:40.607 --> 20:41.906
We're keeping this
in a bank

20:41.908 --> 20:43.908
With two major branches.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.479
