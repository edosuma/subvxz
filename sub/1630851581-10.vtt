We are standing in front
of the Kasenti tower,

00:37.579 --> 00:40.749
where Mr Kasenti is expected
to issue a statement.

00:40.749 --> 00:44.169
The famous philanthropist,
known for his worldwide...

00:44.169 --> 00:46.964
Oh, no! Where did I put
my Dictaphone?

00:46.964 --> 00:49.091
I can't cover the news
without it!

00:54.513 --> 00:58.267
Well, this ancient thing
will have to do the trick.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.519
Please welcome Mr Kasenti.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.569
We're free!
Now, time for basketball.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.696
‐ Ow!
‐ What's up, Baker?

01:10.696 --> 01:14.032
‐ Catch you off guard?
‐ I'd rather give you a chance!

01:14.032 --> 01:16.451
Hold on, kids!
I have an announcement!

01:16.577 --> 01:19.204
Summer vacation starts tomorrow,
right?

01:19.329 --> 01:24.126
Uh... No, it had something
to do with H20... Oh!

01:24.126 --> 01:27.045
Oh, yes!
Due to the loss of my shorts,

01:27.045 --> 01:29.381
tomorrow's basketball practice
is cancelled.

01:29.548 --> 01:32.426
BOTH: What?

01:32.551 --> 01:35.721
Oh, not to worry,
Asta found my speedos

01:35.721 --> 01:37.723
so you'll have swimming lessons!

01:38.056 --> 01:41.560
‐ S‐swimming? Like in water?
‐ No, in the sky. Duh!

01:41.685 --> 01:44.521
What's the matter,
you scared of water?

01:44.521 --> 01:48.442
Who? Me? Pfft, as if.
I take to water like a fish.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.610
I used to swim with dolphins
all the time!

01:51.194 --> 01:54.364
One of my BFFs
actually is a dolphin.

01:55.032 --> 01:58.327
Back in California,
they called me the Wave Tamer.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.037
What're you playing at, Andy?

02:00.037 --> 02:03.957
‐ One time, I out‐swam a shark!
‐ Really?

02:03.957 --> 02:07.085
‐ You never mentioned that!
‐ 'Cause he's joking, obvi.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.922
Am not! I almost broke
the swimming record that day!

02:10.922 --> 02:13.592
What are talking about?
You can't even swim the crawl.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.097
(Mocking laughter)

02:19.097 --> 02:21.099
You can't swim the crawl?

02:21.099 --> 02:24.019
Where'd they call you
the Wave Tamer, the kiddy pool?

02:24.019 --> 02:26.605
(Laughter)

02:30.692 --> 02:32.027
What?

02:37.115 --> 02:38.450
(Panting)

02:38.450 --> 02:40.077
Mr Kasenti,
what can you tell us

02:40.077 --> 02:41.703
about your new security system?

02:42.079 --> 02:45.165
What about your art collection?
Can you tell us more about that?

02:45.290 --> 02:47.125
Those are personal matters.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.128
Today, I'll be reading
a prepared statement

02:50.128 --> 02:52.589
about Kascorp Tech's
latest tablet.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.308
‐ (Evil laugh)
‐ (Screaming)

03:06.687 --> 03:08.563
Run for...

03:08.563 --> 03:11.149
(Squeaky voice) Huh?
What's happening to my voice?

03:20.534 --> 03:21.743
Hey, Andy!

03:24.454 --> 03:26.081
Wait up, Andy!

03:27.624 --> 03:31.336
‐ Hey, Andy!
‐ Happy, Liv? My rep is ruined!

03:31.336 --> 03:33.588
You'd have ruined it
by paddling your way

03:33.588 --> 03:35.382
through swim class
like a poodle.

03:35.507 --> 03:39.970
‐ I was gonna call in sick!
‐ Come on. It'll blow over.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.515
Yo, Baker! Wanna borrow
my little cousin's water wings?

03:43.515 --> 03:47.102
‐ (Laughter)
‐ Ghost!

03:54.484 --> 03:56.278
What's up with my vocal chords?

03:56.403 --> 03:57.988
(Laughter)

04:01.408 --> 04:04.035
Greetings, kids!
I was just snoozing

04:04.035 --> 04:08.248
when the Boomap popped with a
completely undocumented ghost!

04:08.248 --> 04:11.126
Who knows what this one
is capable of?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.545
(Squeaky)
I've got a pretty good idea!

04:13.670 --> 04:17.215
Oh, I see! I mean... hear.

04:17.215 --> 04:20.302
Let's call this fella...
Vochaos!

04:20.302 --> 04:23.388
Now Boo‐cap its butt
before it boosts!

04:23.513 --> 04:25.557
‐ (Laughter)
‐ Aaah!

04:28.477 --> 04:30.353
(Deep voice) Aaah! What the ‐‐ ?

04:30.479 --> 04:32.314
Help!

04:32.314 --> 04:35.442
Woohoo!
My voice is finally breaking!

04:35.567 --> 04:37.319
Should I hide to transform?

04:37.319 --> 04:39.488
'Cause if you're gonna
blab that secret,

04:39.488 --> 04:42.199
‐ it's not worth the trouble.
‐ Stop it, Andy!

04:42.199 --> 04:45.619
‐ Er, guys, not a good time!
‐ It's not my fault

04:45.619 --> 04:48.079
you were showing off
like some surfer dude!

04:48.079 --> 04:49.748
‐ Um...
‐ You didn't need to wreck

04:49.748 --> 04:51.750
‐ my reputation because of it!
‐ Guys!

04:52.042 --> 04:53.418
BOTH: What? (Gasp)

04:53.543 --> 04:55.253
(Laughter)

05:04.179 --> 05:06.681
(Evil laugh)

05:06.681 --> 05:08.391
‐ Nice one.
‐ Nice one.

05:08.391 --> 05:11.645
(Squeaky)
Uh... Let's go, Ghost Force!

05:12.646 --> 05:15.524
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

05:21.029 --> 05:22.280
Fury!

05:23.031 --> 05:24.491
Krush!

05:25.992 --> 05:27.327
Myst!

05:30.622 --> 05:32.165
Ghost Force!

05:33.416 --> 05:35.168
Aaah!

05:40.966 --> 05:42.634
(Evil laugh)

05:47.055 --> 05:51.601
I order you to hold your tongue,
in the name of the law!

05:51.601 --> 05:53.937
(Voice disappears completely)

05:53.937 --> 05:55.355
(Ghost chuckles)

05:55.355 --> 05:57.649
A Boo energy spike?

05:57.649 --> 06:01.111
Don't tell me Vochaos
has gone into booster mode!

06:01.111 --> 06:04.197
Affirmative. Now it's making
everyone lose their voice.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.032
Oh! What happened?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.993
We had a bit of a hiccup.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.580
Be careful, now.
We don't want you tongue‐tied!

06:11.580 --> 06:14.374
Ha, ha!
Anyway, you should try to find

06:14.374 --> 06:17.669
its primary source of power
before Glowboo arrives!

06:23.216 --> 06:25.427
Aaah!

06:28.263 --> 06:30.682
‐ (Laughter)
‐ No need for backup!

06:34.686 --> 06:37.022
The real MVP is on it!

06:44.195 --> 06:45.238
Aaah!

06:49.743 --> 06:52.329
‐ (Laughter)
‐ (Screaming)

06:57.584 --> 07:01.504
‐ Whoa! We almost got hit!
‐ Thanks to you showing off!

07:04.424 --> 07:08.470
I was just trying to protect
everyone! Have some faith, sis!

07:08.470 --> 07:10.597
Have some faith? Seriously?

07:10.597 --> 07:13.683
Quiet! I've got a plan
to neutralise it!

07:14.017 --> 07:16.394
It's hard to have faith
in a big show off!

07:16.519 --> 07:18.647
It's hard to have faith
in a sister

07:18.647 --> 07:21.483
‐ who spills your secrets!
‐ Enough!

07:21.483 --> 07:23.526
BOTH: Huh?

07:24.069 --> 07:25.195
(Laughter)

07:29.616 --> 07:31.993
Krush!

07:31.993 --> 07:33.620
(Laughter)

07:33.620 --> 07:35.163
Flight‐mode activated.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.170
What is our attack strategy?

07:51.721 --> 07:54.307
Uh‐oh...
Escaping mode activated!

07:57.560 --> 07:59.646
Way to keep your eye
on the ball!

07:59.646 --> 08:02.399
‐ Krush got hit 'cause of you!
‐ You distracted me,

08:02.399 --> 08:04.984
like you've done
since the start!

08:04.984 --> 08:08.071
You know what? Sometimes
I wish I was an only child!

08:08.613 --> 08:10.448
Oh, yeah? Well, me too!

08:21.084 --> 08:25.380
Are you playing charades?
Uh... is it a cat?

08:25.380 --> 08:26.715
No, a dog!

08:27.632 --> 08:29.718
‐ FURY: A shrimp!
‐ A frog.

08:29.718 --> 08:33.304
A sandwich. You mean
you want a Kung fu sandwich!

08:33.304 --> 08:34.723
A Kung fu dog?

08:34.723 --> 08:36.975
Ugh, gross! Lemme go!

08:37.475 --> 08:41.020
Wait. That's his plan!
We freeze Vochaos' tongue

08:41.020 --> 08:44.232
‐ with Krush's fractal boo...
‐ And there goes its power!

08:44.232 --> 08:46.026
Nice one, Krush!

08:46.026 --> 08:47.318
‐ Yeah.
‐ Anyway.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.543
‐ Glowboo!
‐ Warning.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.588
My ghost shield is
a major Boo energy drain.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.303
It's on the other side!

09:18.600 --> 09:20.185
Myst! Look out!

09:21.186 --> 09:22.187
Aaah!

09:23.104 --> 09:24.564
‐ Aaah!
‐ Fury!

09:28.234 --> 09:29.694
Are you OK, bro?

09:34.741 --> 09:38.661
Thanks for that. The ghost
would already be in a Boocap,

09:38.661 --> 09:40.455
if we hadn't fought so much.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.082
We have to fix it...

09:42.749 --> 09:44.167
together?

10:04.521 --> 10:05.563
Ow!

10:06.314 --> 10:08.775
Taste this, you drooly tongue!

10:27.460 --> 10:29.420
Come on, Krush,
let's finish this!

10:36.594 --> 10:39.097
What's up? Cat got your tongue?

10:41.933 --> 10:43.268
Octocat!

10:56.656 --> 10:59.159
Aaah!

11:06.332 --> 11:07.375
Aaah!

11:13.089 --> 11:15.633
Backup!
We need backup on midtown!

11:15.633 --> 11:18.469
Oh... uh... Forget that.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.471
I've got the situation
under control.

11:20.638 --> 11:24.309
I've always been a kind of...
(High‐pitched voice) a poet.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.477
‐ Ha!
‐ (Groans)

11:26.644 --> 11:29.189
(Cheering)

11:29.564 --> 11:33.526
Ah, my magnificent voice!
I've missed you so!

11:33.818 --> 11:36.279
Have to admit
I missed your jokes.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.156
BOTH: I'm sorry.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.658
I shouldn't have blabbed
you can't swim.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.995
Sure, but I shouldn't have
pretended to be someone I'm not.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.080
Took you long enough
to admit that!

11:46.206 --> 11:47.665
Boo‐yah!

11:48.041 --> 11:51.211
This ghost won't be able
to silence the city any more.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.171
Ooh! I can't wait to tame it!

11:53.296 --> 11:59.177
But first, I will finally
be able to finish my nap!

11:59.177 --> 12:00.929
Oh, what are you kids gonna do?

12:01.179 --> 12:05.683
Well, I think some of us have
swim practice back at my pool!

12:05.683 --> 12:08.895
‐ Right, Wave Tamer?
‐ Yeah!

12:26.329 --> 12:29.707
Jay, are you done?
I need your help with the cake!

12:29.707 --> 12:31.167
I'm coming!

12:43.221 --> 12:45.056
He's on the move!

12:46.224 --> 12:50.979
(Humming)

12:50.979 --> 12:53.273
‐ Surprise!
‐ Aaah!

12:53.731 --> 12:57.443
‐ What's going on?
‐ Blow out the candles!

13:04.242 --> 13:05.994
(Laughter)

13:05.994 --> 13:07.161
Huh?

13:08.621 --> 13:09.747
What?

13:12.041 --> 13:13.751
(Laughter)

13:16.713 --> 13:18.923
Happy birthday, Andy!

13:19.882 --> 13:22.677
Cool! Whoa!

13:22.677 --> 13:24.887
The latest Fury action figure?

13:24.887 --> 13:26.889
Sweet!

13:27.015 --> 13:30.893
‐ (Chuckles)
‐ (Laughter)

13:31.769 --> 13:35.148
Bim! Bam! Boo‐yah!
Gotcha, ghost!

13:35.982 --> 13:37.859
‐ What?
‐ Nothing!

13:38.276 --> 13:40.153
Come on, Liv. Spit it out.

13:40.278 --> 13:44.991
It's just that, the box says
it's for ages five and up.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.161
Huh? Yeah, "and up"!

13:48.161 --> 13:51.122
Too bad old lady Liv
is too grown‐up for fun.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.790
Huh? Oh, yeah?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.667
I know how to have fun
without acting

13:54.834 --> 13:55.626
like a toddler!

13:58.629 --> 14:02.717
Piñata time!
Who's up to bat first?

14:10.224 --> 14:12.143
Aaah!

14:14.228 --> 14:16.189
(Laughter)

14:16.814 --> 14:18.357
(Screaming)

14:26.407 --> 14:28.326
‐ Oh, no!
‐ No!

14:44.801 --> 14:45.927
‐ Ah!
‐ Huh?

14:48.054 --> 14:48.096
‐ No!
‐ Ugh!

14:48.471 --> 14:50.473
‐ No!
‐ Ugh!

14:51.724 --> 14:54.727
Hey, that's my toy!

14:54.727 --> 14:57.230
Hey, that's mine!

14:58.272 --> 15:00.733
Um, are your parents
acting like little kids?

15:01.275 --> 15:03.486
(Laughter)

15:06.280 --> 15:08.157
(Screaming)

15:09.784 --> 15:12.411
Hey, I don't like you!

15:12.411 --> 15:14.080
‐ Aaah!
‐ No!

15:17.333 --> 15:19.168
I am ready for the Boo‐fight.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.087
Query. Where is the ghost?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.256
Hey, that's mine!

15:26.384 --> 15:28.094
(Wailing)

15:28.719 --> 15:32.098
‐ Happy birthday, Mike!
‐ Uh, thanks, Ms Jones,

15:32.098 --> 15:34.183
but it's Andy's birthday,
not mine.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.519
Oh, darn! I got it wrong!

15:36.519 --> 15:40.481
Anyhoo, you're dealing
with Alastric, a level‐7 ghost,

15:40.481 --> 15:42.316
and it's not an easy one.

15:42.441 --> 15:45.403
Tell me about it. It's already
merged with one of Andy's

15:45.403 --> 15:48.614
‐ birthday‐cake candles.
‐ I can see its Boo‐signature

15:48.614 --> 15:51.367
heading towards midtown.
You better get a move on!

15:51.367 --> 15:53.578
Hey! That's mine! Quit it!

15:58.624 --> 16:02.503
Hey, here's a mission for you.
Babysitting my parents!

16:02.503 --> 16:06.132
‐ Affirmative.
‐ Let's go, Ghost Force!

16:06.716 --> 16:09.427
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

16:14.765 --> 16:16.184
Fury!

16:16.767 --> 16:18.436
Krush!

16:19.729 --> 16:21.147
Myst!

16:24.567 --> 16:25.776
Ghost Force!

16:29.197 --> 16:32.158
‐ Uh‐oh!
‐ (Evil laugh)

16:39.207 --> 16:41.209
Freeze your wax, fella!

16:41.209 --> 16:44.503
Sorry, but your next
birthday party will be in jail!

16:50.009 --> 16:51.677
Vroom, vroom!

16:54.513 --> 16:55.514
(Laughter)

16:59.352 --> 17:01.604
Looks like
we're on babysitting duty too.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.315
We gotta get everybody
to a child‐proof zone!

17:04.315 --> 17:07.485
I'll deal with kidults,
you go after him.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.448
Come on, this way!

17:13.241 --> 17:15.743
Yoohoo! Why won't anyone listen?

17:16.786 --> 17:18.162
(Chuckles)

17:18.287 --> 17:20.414
(Laughter)

17:20.790 --> 17:22.583
Yo, kidults!

17:24.252 --> 17:26.295
Catch me if you can!

17:26.295 --> 17:28.673
Come on, Fury,
stop playing like a kid!

17:28.673 --> 17:30.424
We have a ghost issue here!

17:32.218 --> 17:34.053
Yoohoo! Ha, ha!

17:34.178 --> 17:35.638
Please stop that!

17:36.264 --> 17:38.307
(Laughter)

17:40.351 --> 17:42.562
‐ You were saying?
‐ Hate to interrupt,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.647
but if you don't capture
the ghost soon,

17:44.647 --> 17:47.066
all of New York
will be a playpen!

17:47.567 --> 17:48.609
Let's go!

17:54.156 --> 17:55.575
Waah! Waah!

17:56.200 --> 17:57.743
(Laughter)

18:02.707 --> 18:04.292
Fractal power!

18:10.214 --> 18:11.257
Fractal trap!

18:15.219 --> 18:17.430
The flame's where he gets
his power from!

18:17.430 --> 18:19.724
‐ If we can get to it ‐‐
‐ It's my birthday!

18:19.724 --> 18:21.267
I'll blow it out!

18:29.191 --> 18:30.151
Easy win!

18:36.365 --> 18:37.283
Fury!

18:44.498 --> 18:46.334
The flame keeps reigniting,

18:46.334 --> 18:49.170
but there's gotta be
some way to snuff it out.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.589
Would you just come up
with a plan?

18:51.589 --> 18:53.466
Excuse me for trying something!

18:53.466 --> 18:55.426
I know how to smother the flame!

18:55.426 --> 18:57.637
I just gotta hit it
with fractal goo and ‐‐

18:57.637 --> 18:59.430
Aaah!

19:00.765 --> 19:02.141
BOTH: Krush!

19:03.351 --> 19:05.603
Krush, are you all right?

19:07.063 --> 19:09.690
(Wails like a baby)

19:09.815 --> 19:13.235
(Laughter)

19:18.699 --> 19:20.409
Krush, use your power!

19:20.534 --> 19:23.454
You handle the ghost,
I'll take care of Baby Krush!

19:32.672 --> 19:33.673
Ho, ho, ho!

19:34.048 --> 19:35.424
The flame, it changes colour!

19:39.470 --> 19:43.641
Hey, Krush! Look at me!
I'm a super‐cool ninja hero!

19:46.352 --> 19:48.479
‐ (Gurgles)
‐ Now, your turn!

19:48.479 --> 19:50.439
Give it a try, little guy!

19:56.779 --> 19:59.573
Did you just get Baby Krush
to use his powers?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.119
Did I?

20:11.127 --> 20:12.044
Watch out!

20:15.172 --> 20:16.132
No!

20:17.258 --> 20:18.384
Spectral gate!

20:25.725 --> 20:27.309
Fury, you OK?

20:27.435 --> 20:31.188
Yeah,
just feeling a little rickety,

20:31.188 --> 20:34.483
and I have a strange urge
to do a crossword puzzle.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.527
OK, weird side‐effect.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.779
Don't ya wanna play
ninja‐hero with Krush?

20:39.113 --> 20:42.658
Pish‐posh, young lady,
I'm too old for horseplay.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.784
(Cracking sound)

20:43.784 --> 20:46.287
Not to mention my poor old back.

20:46.454 --> 20:50.040
‐ What just happened?
‐ (Ghost laughs)

20:55.463 --> 20:56.756
(Cracking sound) Argh!

20:57.089 --> 20:59.175
Its power's changed.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.509
Glowboo, we need backup!

21:00.634 --> 21:02.386
Very sorry, Myst,

21:02.386 --> 21:04.555
but I'm a little tied
up right now.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.475
Can you please stop hitting me?

21:09.101 --> 21:12.313
‐ Pew! Pew!
‐ Hey, Krush! Look at me!

21:16.108 --> 21:19.069
(Groans) Kids these days...

21:19.069 --> 21:21.572
Now, your turn, use your power.

21:21.572 --> 21:24.116
‐ Pew! Pew!
‐ Hello?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.619
Would you please look at me
when I'm speaking to you!

21:27.578 --> 21:30.706
Time out!
You listen to me, Krush!

21:30.706 --> 21:34.293
(Throws tantrum)

21:42.551 --> 21:43.677
Huh?

21:47.640 --> 21:53.354
Whoa! Slow down, whippersnapper.
You'll cause an accident.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.231
Of course!

21:56.524 --> 21:59.610
Boo‐hoo! Catch me if you can!

22:11.664 --> 22:12.623
Spectral gate!

22:21.507 --> 22:23.634
And that is for your birthday!

22:25.678 --> 22:27.179
Octocat!

22:49.577 --> 22:51.036
Waah!

22:55.374 --> 22:56.709
(Sobbing)

22:57.501 --> 22:58.627
BOTH: Yes!

23:02.214 --> 23:04.967
Activate
emergency withdrawal protocol.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.723
Boo‐yah!

23:16.020 --> 23:17.563
Here you go, buddy!

23:20.691 --> 23:24.737
That was a close one,
but we saved the day once again.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.740
I'm just relieved everyone's
finally acting their age,

23:27.740 --> 23:29.366
especially you two!

23:29.366 --> 23:31.660
Who knew I'd be
such a grumpy grandpa?

23:32.369 --> 23:34.788
I'm sorry for
judging you before, Andy.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.750
You were right.
You're never too old for fun.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.585
Speaking of which...

23:39.585 --> 23:43.631
Myst is on a mission!
Spectral gate!

23:43.631 --> 23:47.217
Flexy blast! Bam, bam, bam!

23:47.217 --> 23:50.012
Krush to the rescue!

23:50.012 --> 23:51.305
(Laughter)
