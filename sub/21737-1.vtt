00:40.826 --> 00:42.265
- Okay.

00:42.266 --> 00:43.880
Okay, okay.

00:43.881 --> 00:47.619
- Everyone's asking me, begging me,

00:47.620 --> 00:49.787
to do another masterpiece.

00:51.002 --> 00:54.753
I am so sick and tired of masterpieces.

00:54.754 --> 00:57.662
I cannot begin to tell you.

00:57.663 --> 01:01.386
Who the fuck needs a masterpiece any more?

01:01.387 --> 01:02.220
- Hi.

01:02.221 --> 01:05.319
My name is Todd, and I'm a filmmaker.

01:05.319 --> 01:06.729
- You look around, you look around

01:06.730 --> 01:11.245
and you know there's nothing
worth shooting any more.

01:11.246 --> 01:14.329
That's my 20 years of silence.

01:14.330 --> 01:16.005
I consider that genius.

01:16.006 --> 01:19.726
Everyone considers my other things genius.

01:19.727 --> 01:22.073
Perhaps they were good, but not

01:22.074 --> 01:24.831
as genius as my total silence.

01:24.832 --> 01:27.844
- And I'm reaching out
to you, Mr. Libragy, sir

01:27.845 --> 01:30.345
because you are the master of the form,

01:30.346 --> 01:32.513
and I got your book today,

01:33.360 --> 01:35.141
The Truth At All Costs!

01:35.142 --> 01:38.060
- Shit, that book is shit!

01:38.061 --> 01:39.983
- It's my new bible.

01:39.984 --> 01:42.676
I found at the same time,
which I took as a sign,

01:42.677 --> 01:46.124
this flier for a feminist film festival.

01:46.125 --> 01:47.383
- Stop.

01:47.384 --> 01:49.967
I call that cunt film festival,

01:51.820 --> 01:53.737
and he discovered that,

01:54.996 --> 01:57.381
and he's interested in that.

01:57.382 --> 01:59.056
That's fascinating.

01:59.057 --> 02:00.659
That's a loser.

02:00.660 --> 02:01.585
- Something in me tells me...

02:01.586 --> 02:02.659
- Excuse me, sir.

02:02.660 --> 02:04.819
- That this is what I'm supposed to do.

02:04.820 --> 02:05.653
- Sir.

02:05.654 --> 02:06.818
- I'm gonna make a documentary
about the women in my family

02:06.819 --> 02:08.848
because they are strong
and they are courageous

02:08.848 --> 02:09.787
and I'm reaching out to you

02:09.788 --> 02:11.940
for any kind of help you can
give me, any kind of guidance.

02:11.941 --> 02:12.774
- Come on, come on.

02:12.775 --> 02:14.455
- He needs my help.

02:14.456 --> 02:17.542
I will not give it to him, of course.

02:17.543 --> 02:18.405
- That's my tape.

02:18.405 --> 02:19.238
That's my tape.

02:19.238 --> 02:20.071
The tape belongs to me.

02:20.072 --> 02:21.081
I came in with the tape.

02:21.082 --> 02:22.503
- All right, well take
your tape and you're done.

02:22.504 --> 02:23.347
- You didn't give me it.

02:23.347 --> 02:24.293
You have to give me the tape.

02:24.294 --> 02:28.133
I'm totally ready to do
whatever you want me to do.

02:28.134 --> 02:30.819
I love Eastern Europeans.

02:30.820 --> 02:32.653
I've said that before.

02:33.614 --> 02:37.781
- Then I think this guy
wants to do a documentary.

02:39.071 --> 02:42.378
So, if I do a documentary about some guy

02:42.379 --> 02:44.704
who wants to do a documentary,

02:44.705 --> 02:46.955
all of a sudden, I thought,

02:48.084 --> 02:51.006
that is of interest to me.

02:51.007 --> 02:52.507
Let others suffer.

03:07.495 --> 03:08.495
- Hi.

03:09.509 --> 03:11.565
Just really quick, I just
wanna say that it just,

03:11.566 --> 03:14.036
it means the world to me that you're here,

03:14.037 --> 03:15.663
and I am so respectful

03:15.664 --> 03:20.184
and I've been reading your
book and it's my bible.

03:20.185 --> 03:22.476
Nothing like this has ever happened to me.

03:22.477 --> 03:24.560
It means the world to me.

03:25.618 --> 03:28.510
We're here at my high school reunion.

03:28.511 --> 03:30.532
It was a very small school.

03:30.533 --> 03:33.778
There are 41 people in
my graduating class.

03:33.779 --> 03:36.112
I'm excited to see everyone.

03:37.136 --> 03:38.386
We're going in.

03:40.375 --> 03:44.542
Listen, when I was in high
school, I was kind of a big shot,

03:45.398 --> 03:47.745
and it would mean a lot to
people if I was doing well,

03:47.746 --> 03:50.887
so if we could kinda
act like you're with me,

03:50.888 --> 03:52.555
that would be great.

03:53.988 --> 03:55.773
You're not gonna...

03:55.774 --> 03:57.150
We don't speak, you don't speak.

03:57.151 --> 03:58.520
I understand, I understand.

03:58.521 --> 03:59.354
It was in the book.

03:59.355 --> 04:03.560
- Read my fucking books, even
though when I wrote them,

04:03.561 --> 04:05.690
I must have been drunk,

04:05.691 --> 04:06.818
because I have no idea

04:06.819 --> 04:09.574
why in the world would I write that crap

04:09.575 --> 04:13.167
and why in the world millions
of people would read the crap

04:13.168 --> 04:17.069
and think I'm some kind
of a genius, which I am.

04:17.070 --> 04:18.000
- That's great, Todd.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.834
- Thank you.

04:18.834 --> 04:19.666
- It's good to see you.

04:19.668 --> 04:20.673
- It's good to see you.

04:20.673 --> 04:21.507
You're looking great.

04:21.507 --> 04:22.340
- You too.

04:22.340 --> 04:23.297
- Ah thanks.

04:23.297 --> 04:24.130
- Thanks.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.130
- Thanks.

04:25.914 --> 04:28.416
Is that the kind of stuff you want?

04:28.417 --> 04:30.417
Just candid, just stuff?

04:35.373 --> 04:36.900
Are there snacks or...

04:36.901 --> 04:38.917
I'm a documentary filmmaker now,

04:38.918 --> 04:41.385
and I'm making a documentary
about female empowerment,

04:41.386 --> 04:43.028
and this is Ivan Libragi,

04:43.029 --> 04:45.172
who is a very big deal
in the documentary world.

04:45.173 --> 04:46.800
He wrote this book,
The Truth At All Costs,

04:46.801 --> 04:48.332
and he made big documentaries

04:48.333 --> 04:50.698
about the cruelty of the
bird-watching industry.

04:50.699 --> 04:51.668
- Do you know what, Todd?

04:51.668 --> 04:52.501
- Called Two In the Bush.

04:52.502 --> 04:55.486
- You should talk to Brandon Dietz.

04:55.487 --> 04:57.040
He was AD Club.

04:57.041 --> 04:57.874
- He's right over there.

04:57.874 --> 04:58.739
- He's right over there.

04:58.739 --> 04:59.572
You should talk to him.

04:59.573 --> 05:02.933
He would be so interested
in this kind of thing.

05:02.934 --> 05:03.767
That's what he does.

05:03.768 --> 05:04.922
He does commercials now.

05:04.923 --> 05:06.534
You should talk to him.

05:06.535 --> 05:07.368
- Hey, hey.

05:07.369 --> 05:08.733
- A lot a people don't
understand that the purpose...

05:08.734 --> 05:11.800
- Hey, they were telling me
that you make local commercials.

05:11.801 --> 05:12.651
- It's true.

05:12.652 --> 05:14.788
- Obviously I'm making a documentary.

05:14.789 --> 05:16.888
- I'll let you guys catch up.

05:16.889 --> 05:17.722
- Great talking to you.

05:17.722 --> 05:18.555
- See you.

05:18.555 --> 05:19.553
- I'm just getting into
making documentaries,

05:19.554 --> 05:20.827
and this is Ivan Libragi,
who is a very big...

05:20.828 --> 05:21.849
- Rod.

05:21.850 --> 05:22.683
- Todd.

05:22.683 --> 05:23.516
It's very close, Todd.

05:23.516 --> 05:24.479
- I remember a Rod.

05:24.479 --> 05:25.377
Are you sure?

05:25.378 --> 05:27.716
- Yeah, it's Todd.

05:27.717 --> 05:29.502
- Brandon Dietz.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.017
That's funny.

05:32.018 --> 05:33.004
He makes commercials.

05:33.005 --> 05:35.980
He's a real loser.

05:35.981 --> 05:36.814
- Hi.

05:36.814 --> 05:37.647
- Hey.

05:37.647 --> 05:38.480
- It's Rebecca.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.313
- Hey, Rebecca.

05:39.313 --> 05:40.146
- Nice to see you.

05:40.146 --> 05:40.979
- Aw, come on.

05:40.979 --> 05:41.812
- How are you?

05:41.812 --> 05:42.645
- It's great to see you.

05:42.645 --> 05:43.478
- It's so good to see you.

05:43.478 --> 05:44.311
- You remember Brandon?

05:44.311 --> 05:45.144
- Hey, yeah.

05:45.144 --> 05:45.977
Good to see you.

05:45.977 --> 05:46.810
- Oh yeah, Brandon, nice to see you.

05:46.810 --> 05:47.643
- How are you?

05:47.643 --> 05:48.477
- Good good, great.

05:48.478 --> 05:49.485
- What is all this?

05:49.486 --> 05:51.484
- Yeah, Todd, what's going on?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.691
- I'm becoming a documentary filmmaker

05:53.692 --> 05:56.467
and I'm making a documentary
about female empowerment,

05:56.468 --> 05:59.218
and this is a very famous
documentary filmmaker

05:59.219 --> 06:02.301
and he's documenting me as
I go through my process,

06:02.302 --> 06:03.330
which is why I wanted to talk to you,

06:03.331 --> 06:05.677
because Brandon here, he
makes local commercials,

06:05.678 --> 06:07.656
and I just thought we should network

06:07.657 --> 06:08.707
and get to know each other,

06:08.708 --> 06:11.889
because we're sort of in
the same business now.

06:11.890 --> 06:12.723
- You had braces!

06:12.724 --> 06:14.257
- I would love to come
by and observe your work.

06:14.258 --> 06:15.557
- She definitely had braces.

06:15.558 --> 06:17.149
That's why I wasn't sure...

06:17.150 --> 06:17.983
- I did have braces for so long.

06:17.983 --> 06:18.816
- You look great.

06:18.816 --> 06:19.649
- You don't have them anymore.

06:19.649 --> 06:20.482
- You look great too.

06:20.483 --> 06:21.812
This is amazing you're doing this.

06:21.813 --> 06:22.646
- Oh thanks.

06:22.647 --> 06:24.123
- You always had so much passion.

06:24.124 --> 06:26.374
- Rebecca, nice ass.

06:27.645 --> 06:29.025
- In high school I remember
you were doing that...

06:29.026 --> 06:29.867
- It's Lane!

06:29.867 --> 06:30.700
- Photography project thing.

06:30.700 --> 06:31.533
- Yeah.

06:31.533 --> 06:32.366
- Isn't your last name Lane?

06:32.366 --> 06:33.199
- Yes, yeah, I got married.

06:33.199 --> 06:34.032
- Oh.
- Oh.

06:34.032 --> 06:34.865
- Great.

06:34.866 --> 06:35.919
- You couldn't come.

06:35.920 --> 06:36.753
- Right, yeah.
- That figures, yeah.

06:36.754 --> 06:38.262
- But it was a
photography project, right?

06:38.263 --> 06:39.608
- Right, and I made that film

06:39.609 --> 06:41.596
about the oppression of
the janitors at the school.

06:41.597 --> 06:43.009
- I loved that film!

06:43.010 --> 06:43.843
That was amazing!

06:43.843 --> 06:44.676
- Thank you, thank you, it was...

06:44.677 --> 06:45.682
- I'm sorry, hold on.

06:45.683 --> 06:46.516
Hello?

06:46.516 --> 06:47.349
- But yeah, we can...

06:47.349 --> 06:48.182
- Yeah, no.

06:48.182 --> 06:49.015
- Anytime, I would love to come...

06:49.015 --> 06:49.848
- I'm sorry, it's my husband.

06:49.849 --> 06:50.876
- Oh sure.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.142
- No I can't.

06:52.143 --> 06:55.403
Because I've only been here for...

06:55.404 --> 06:56.237
Okay, fine.

06:56.237 --> 06:57.070
I'm so sorry.

06:57.070 --> 06:57.903
I have to go.

06:57.903 --> 06:58.736
My husband's having a problem at home.

06:58.737 --> 07:00.133
I have to go.

07:00.134 --> 07:01.036
- You're not going going though?

07:01.036 --> 07:01.869
- It was great to see you, Todd.

07:01.870 --> 07:03.035
- Great to see you.

07:03.036 --> 07:04.036
Yeah, yeah.

07:07.091 --> 07:08.656
- If you have a card or
anything, that would be great.

07:08.657 --> 07:09.490
- Sure sure sure sure.

07:09.490 --> 07:10.476
- That would be great.

07:10.476 --> 07:11.440
- Yeah, this is my direct line.

07:11.441 --> 07:13.317
Don't call that, just call
the office right there

07:13.318 --> 07:16.325
and my secretary will do what she does.

07:16.326 --> 07:17.725
It was great to see you.

07:17.726 --> 07:18.684
Good luck.

07:18.685 --> 07:20.339
- All right, all right, all right.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.930
I don't know, something's
happening with me.

07:21.931 --> 07:24.348
I'm on a road, I'm on a path.

07:25.393 --> 07:28.924
I saw that Brandon Dietz
and he's some sort of,

07:28.925 --> 07:30.199
makes local commercials,

07:30.200 --> 07:32.218
and he's definitely an up-and-comer

07:32.219 --> 07:33.866
and he has a business card and a secretary

07:33.867 --> 07:37.098
and I'm gonna follow
through, I'm gonna see him.

07:38.901 --> 07:41.563
I'm sorry, do we have to cut for that?

07:41.564 --> 07:42.894
Sorry.

07:42.895 --> 07:46.112
I'll just let the machine pick up.

07:46.113 --> 07:47.332
It's probably my mom, it's okay.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.166
- Leave a message

07:48.167 --> 07:50.260
and I'll get back to you right away.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.284
- You wanted me to answer
the question again or...

07:51.285 --> 07:54.987
- This is Rebecca
calling, from the reunion.

07:54.988 --> 07:55.821
- Oh.

07:55.822 --> 07:58.043
Excuse me, excuse me just a sec.

07:58.044 --> 07:58.877
- Hope you don't
mind I'm calling you,

07:58.878 --> 08:01.370
I found your number in the phone book.

08:01.371 --> 08:03.249
It was really great to see you and...

08:03.250 --> 08:04.732
- Hello hello hello?

08:04.733 --> 08:05.655
- Todd?

08:05.655 --> 08:06.488
- Hey!

08:06.488 --> 08:07.321
Rebecca?

08:07.321 --> 08:08.154
- Hi.

08:08.154 --> 08:08.987
Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:08.987 --> 08:09.820
- Hi.

08:09.820 --> 08:10.653
- Hi!

08:10.653 --> 08:11.486
How are you?

08:11.487 --> 08:13.070
- I'm good, how are you?

08:13.071 --> 08:15.586
- I'm good, I'm okay.

08:15.587 --> 08:17.863
Hey,

08:18.698 --> 08:20.533
It's funny, I'm calling you.

08:20.534 --> 08:23.745
It was really great to
see you at the reunion.

08:23.746 --> 08:25.406
- It was great to see you too.

08:25.407 --> 08:26.297
- I was thinking

08:26.297 --> 08:27.130
about what you were talking about,

08:27.131 --> 08:28.132
that movie that you're doing,

08:28.133 --> 08:30.066
and I was wondering if there was any way

08:30.067 --> 08:32.299
that I could help you out.

08:32.301 --> 08:33.134
- What do you mean?
- I have to go.

08:33.134 --> 08:33.967
Todd, you know what?

08:33.967 --> 08:35.961
I have to go, but maybe I'll call you.

08:35.962 --> 08:39.364
Shoot, with the money, I
could help you with the money.

08:39.365 --> 08:40.198
- You could?

08:40.198 --> 08:41.030
- I definitely could help.

08:41.030 --> 08:41.864
It's not a problem.

08:41.864 --> 08:42.697
Yeah, I definitely could help
you with the money, all right?

08:42.697 --> 08:43.530
- All right.

08:43.530 --> 08:44.363
- Yeah, it's not a problem.

08:44.364 --> 08:47.157
I'll call you tomorrow and
I can get some cash, okay?

08:47.158 --> 08:48.491
I gotta go, bye.

08:53.350 --> 08:54.183
- What does that mean?

08:54.184 --> 08:55.212
What does that mean?

08:55.213 --> 08:56.046
I'll be just a second.

08:56.047 --> 08:57.207
Just a second, just a second.

08:58.604 --> 08:59.437
Hello?

08:59.438 --> 09:00.591
Hello?

09:00.592 --> 09:01.592
Hello?

09:02.845 --> 09:05.586
- It was his boundless optimism

09:05.587 --> 09:08.651
that I found most disturbing.

09:08.652 --> 09:10.402
It's truly disturbing

09:11.518 --> 09:14.218
in a most tickling way.

09:14.219 --> 09:16.966
It tickled me while it disturbed me,

09:16.967 --> 09:19.134
and it made me feel again.

09:20.567 --> 09:22.720
- While supplies
last, and don't delay,

09:22.721 --> 09:25.054
emancipate your smile today.

09:26.636 --> 09:28.800
- And cut, cut it.

09:28.801 --> 09:29.634
- Hey, hey.

09:29.634 --> 09:30.467
- What are you...

09:30.468 --> 09:31.621
- Your secretary said you
were gonna be down here.

09:31.622 --> 09:32.709
- I'm in the...

09:32.710 --> 09:33.987
- I just thought what you were...

09:33.988 --> 09:34.821
Listen...

09:34.821 --> 09:35.654
- I'm in the middle of doing a commercial.

09:35.654 --> 09:36.487
I'm doing my work here.

09:36.487 --> 09:37.320
- I know, we'll totally be out of the way.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.153
I'm just gonna observe your process.

09:38.154 --> 09:39.316
- Guys, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.298
We're doing a commercial and we don't...

09:41.299 --> 09:42.326
- I'll be quiet, I'll be quiet.

09:42.327 --> 09:43.569
- We don't want you here, all right?

09:43.570 --> 09:44.546
We gotta just do this.

09:44.547 --> 09:45.658
- Look at that camera though.

09:45.659 --> 09:46.492
- I think it's okay.

09:46.493 --> 09:48.361
- Are we doing it again?

09:48.362 --> 09:49.195
- That's okay.

09:49.195 --> 09:50.028
It's cool.

09:50.029 --> 09:51.131
They can come in.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.108
It's good publicity.

09:53.109 --> 09:54.479
- Okay.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.313
Sure.

09:55.314 --> 09:57.003
- Come on in, come on in.

09:57.004 --> 09:57.837
- The more the merrier.

09:57.838 --> 09:59.693
- Let's do it from the top then.

09:59.694 --> 10:01.187
- Can we use the bigger camera?

10:01.188 --> 10:02.254
- No, no.

10:02.255 --> 10:03.304
Just look in here.

10:03.305 --> 10:04.474
Don't look in there.

10:04.475 --> 10:05.808
Nope, over here.

10:07.483 --> 10:08.964
Action.

10:08.965 --> 10:10.910
- Ask not what your teeth can do for you,

10:10.911 --> 10:12.681
but what you can do for your teeth.

10:12.682 --> 10:14.349
Hi, I'm Dan Diamond.

10:16.321 --> 10:19.946
All month at Dr. Diamond's
Downtown Dentistry,

10:19.947 --> 10:21.945
if you come in and get a cap,

10:21.946 --> 10:24.304
you get a free cap.

10:24.305 --> 10:26.548
- While supplies last.

10:26.549 --> 10:30.509
- And don't delay,
emancipate your smile today.

10:30.510 --> 10:31.343
- And cut it.

10:31.344 --> 10:33.692
Okay that was pretty good.

10:33.693 --> 10:34.917
Couple notes, couple notes.

10:34.918 --> 10:36.097
Try to get the line,

10:36.098 --> 10:40.015
"Come in and get your teeth
capped, get a free cap."

10:40.016 --> 10:40.849
- That's what I said.

10:40.849 --> 10:41.682
- No, you kinda just said,

10:41.683 --> 10:43.131
"Come in and get a cap, you get a cap."

10:43.132 --> 10:45.041
They're not gonna understand
what you're talking about.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.920
- And one more thing,

10:46.921 --> 10:50.345
isn't it Kennedy that
said the ask not thing?

10:50.346 --> 10:52.064
- Yeah.

10:52.065 --> 10:53.266
- I'm Lincoln.

10:53.267 --> 10:54.204
- You're obviously a professional

10:54.205 --> 10:55.644
and this thing is happening.

10:55.645 --> 10:57.414
We have financing, we have a producer.

10:57.415 --> 10:59.313
We're leaving for Spokane
very soon and I just...

10:59.314 --> 11:00.150
- That's great.

11:00.151 --> 11:01.517
I wish you a lot of luck with this.

11:01.518 --> 11:02.351
- This is your chance to
do something artistic.

11:02.351 --> 11:03.184
This is something...

11:03.185 --> 11:04.851
- It's wonderful, and good luck with it.

11:04.852 --> 11:05.685
I just got...

11:05.685 --> 11:06.518
- To go to the next stage in...

11:06.519 --> 11:07.880
- I have to do my job right now.

11:07.881 --> 11:10.548
- All right, well I'll call you.

11:13.470 --> 11:14.625
- Todd, hey.

11:14.626 --> 11:15.459
- Hey, hey.

11:15.459 --> 11:16.292
- I'm sorry I'm late.

11:16.292 --> 11:17.252
The babysitter had this
thing with her grandmother.

11:17.252 --> 11:18.085
I brought the doughnuts.

11:18.086 --> 11:20.434
- Listen listen, I don't
think he's gonna go for this.

11:20.435 --> 11:21.392
- What do you mean?

11:21.392 --> 11:22.267
- I tried to talk to him.

11:22.267 --> 11:23.115
He doesn't wanna talk to me.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.120
He's very dismissive about it.

11:24.121 --> 11:25.535
- Let me talk to him, let me talk to him.

11:25.536 --> 11:26.876
- All right, all right.

11:26.877 --> 11:27.877
- Brandon.

11:28.881 --> 11:29.714
Brandon.

11:29.714 --> 11:30.547
- Yeah?

11:30.547 --> 11:31.380
- Excuse me, hi.

11:31.380 --> 11:32.213
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Hi.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.046
- How are you?

11:33.046 --> 11:33.879
- Good good.

11:33.879 --> 11:34.712
I brought doughnuts.

11:34.713 --> 11:35.826
I wanted to come watch the shoot.

11:35.827 --> 11:36.660
- That was nice.

11:36.660 --> 11:37.493
- But I'm a little late,

11:37.493 --> 11:38.326
I had a thing with the babysitter,

11:38.327 --> 11:42.194
but anyway, so Todd's film
seems really exciting,

11:42.195 --> 11:45.286
and I've decided to
help with the financing,

11:45.287 --> 11:46.681
and I think it's really gonna happen,

11:46.682 --> 11:49.194
and we would love it if
you would be part of it.

11:49.195 --> 11:50.394
- You're gonna be involved?

11:50.395 --> 11:52.102
- Yeah.

11:52.103 --> 11:53.550
- Huh.

11:53.551 --> 11:55.272
I'm pretty excited.

11:55.273 --> 11:56.695
The idea of working on a documentary,

11:56.696 --> 11:59.945
I think it's maybe the
next step for my career,

11:59.946 --> 12:03.965
something serious and
substantive and giving back

12:03.966 --> 12:05.310
in a different way from commercials.

12:05.311 --> 12:06.771
So, I'm excited about it.

12:06.772 --> 12:07.947
- How do you like this guy?

12:07.948 --> 12:09.565
How do you like this guy?

12:09.566 --> 12:11.225
We're good, right?

12:11.226 --> 12:12.059
- Yeah.

12:12.059 --> 12:12.892
- We're good.

12:12.892 --> 12:13.725
We are making a film.

12:13.726 --> 12:15.984
In the last 24 hours we have a producer,

12:15.985 --> 12:18.718
we have a director of photography.

12:18.719 --> 12:19.552
Do you have a sound guy?

12:19.553 --> 12:21.179
We need a sound guy.

12:21.180 --> 12:22.180
- I have a

12:23.285 --> 12:24.285
guy.

12:25.074 --> 12:26.389
- Yeah yeah yeah, no, I'm sorry I'm late.

12:26.390 --> 12:27.913
I'm here.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.478
I got Dr. Diamond a chicken sandwich.

12:30.479 --> 12:33.206
No no no, trust me,
chicken's vegetarian, dude.

12:33.207 --> 12:35.790
Okay, I'll see you in a minute.

12:37.122 --> 12:38.080
Oh shit.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.080
Oh fuck.

12:42.889 --> 12:44.007
- I wanna get started.

12:44.008 --> 12:46.176
This is the first
official sort of meeting.

12:46.177 --> 12:48.774
I wanted to touch base
before we went to Spokane.

12:48.775 --> 12:52.261
I'm the director and
leader of the project,

12:52.262 --> 12:55.718
which is tentatively called
A Journey To Courage.

12:55.719 --> 12:57.552
- How do you three know each other?

12:57.553 --> 12:58.386
- We went to high school together.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.219
- Yeah.

12:59.219 --> 13:00.052
- We all went to Lemona High.

13:00.052 --> 13:00.885
- Really?

13:00.886 --> 13:02.244
- Yeah, Rebecca and I were good friends,

13:02.245 --> 13:03.489
and Brandon's an acquaintance.

13:03.490 --> 13:04.323
- I was part of that.

13:04.323 --> 13:05.156
- Wait a second.

13:05.157 --> 13:06.645
Brandon, you went to high school?

13:06.646 --> 13:07.479
- Greg.

13:07.479 --> 13:08.342
- But no, I like that.

13:08.342 --> 13:09.175
- Hilarious.

13:09.175 --> 13:10.008
- I like that.

13:10.009 --> 13:11.689
I think we should have
that kind of banter.

13:12.131 --> 13:13.393
Seriously, I think we should
have that kind of banter

13:13.394 --> 13:14.508
in the group.

13:14.509 --> 13:16.307
- But not in the film.

13:16.308 --> 13:17.209
- No.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.811
Quickly, I don't wanna keep you all,

13:19.812 --> 13:21.059
because we have an early morning.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.761
Here are general information packets.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.227
- I didn't mention this before,

13:25.228 --> 13:27.089
but I was hoping that
it would be all right

13:27.090 --> 13:31.625
if I brought my daughter,
Grace, on the shoot.

13:31.626 --> 13:33.417
I know that probably
seems a little unorthodox,

13:33.418 --> 13:36.480
but I feel bad leaving her.

13:36.481 --> 13:38.003
I just am not really
ready to leave her yet.

13:38.004 --> 13:40.176
She's young and 18 months old.

13:40.177 --> 13:41.010
- No, I like that.

13:41.010 --> 13:41.843
- That'd be nice, yeah.

13:41.843 --> 13:42.676
- I like the idea.

13:42.676 --> 13:43.509
- She's a really good baby.

13:43.510 --> 13:46.267
- This is a family and I want
this to have a family feel

13:46.268 --> 13:47.770
on this project.

13:47.771 --> 13:49.155
- I have a niece I could bring too

13:49.156 --> 13:51.217
who is interested in movies.

13:51.218 --> 13:52.163
Should we...

13:52.164 --> 13:53.919
- No, I don't think...

13:53.920 --> 13:55.252
There's necessity for the baby.

13:55.253 --> 13:57.401
- Yeah, no, if you wanted that.

13:57.402 --> 13:59.416
- I tried to find pictures
of people in my family,

13:59.417 --> 14:01.514
but I don't have great pictures.

14:01.515 --> 14:03.206
That's my Aunt Kirby.

14:03.207 --> 14:04.666
There's a funny story.

14:04.667 --> 14:07.938
She got that raincoat and that
bathing suit the same day,

14:07.939 --> 14:09.904
so it's kind of a whimsical picture.

14:09.905 --> 14:12.322
- Can I keep this one?

14:13.335 --> 14:15.034
- He's a sweet guy too, Todd.

14:15.035 --> 14:16.702
He's a sweet person.

14:19.447 --> 14:20.463
Yeah.

14:20.464 --> 14:22.390
When we were younger, I
remember in high school,

14:22.391 --> 14:24.837
I had braces basically for, I don't know,

14:24.838 --> 14:25.706
through high...

14:25.707 --> 14:29.514
I had them for, I don't know,
seven years, I think it was.

14:29.515 --> 14:31.550
I remember this one time I
had a lot of rubber bands

14:31.551 --> 14:33.554
and they were connecting
the top and the bottom

14:33.555 --> 14:36.224
and they used to snap off.

14:36.225 --> 14:37.134
It was just humiliating.

14:37.135 --> 14:38.384
People would tease me.

14:38.385 --> 14:42.172
I remember one time
three snapped off at once

14:42.173 --> 14:45.613
and Todd was down on his
knees looking for them,

14:45.614 --> 14:47.529
and he never found them,

14:47.530 --> 14:49.530
but the next day he came in
with all these rubber bands.

14:49.531 --> 14:50.474
It was so sweet.

14:50.475 --> 14:53.269
They were big rubber bands,

14:53.270 --> 14:54.409
so it didn't fit,

14:54.410 --> 14:55.770
but it was the thought that counts.

14:55.771 --> 14:59.688
He's just really, really
a sweet, sweet person.

15:01.052 --> 15:02.264
- I'm really excited.

15:02.265 --> 15:03.098
- You should be.

15:03.098 --> 15:03.931
- I'm gonna call my mom.

15:03.932 --> 15:04.990
Remind me to call my mom.

15:04.991 --> 15:08.037
What is this machine that you've got, sir?

15:08.038 --> 15:10.773
Is that a sound machine?

15:10.774 --> 15:12.556
Will I be using one of these?

15:12.557 --> 15:14.522
- It's a mixer, Greg.

15:14.523 --> 15:15.356
- What?

15:15.356 --> 15:16.189
- It's a mixer.

15:16.190 --> 15:18.154
- Oh, what does it do?

15:18.155 --> 15:19.921
- It gives you options.

15:19.922 --> 15:21.425
- What does that mean?

15:21.426 --> 15:24.350
- You can take different mics,

15:24.351 --> 15:25.482
people are mic'ed separately,

15:25.483 --> 15:26.925
and put them all into one machine

15:26.926 --> 15:28.775
and it can be on one or two tracks.

15:28.776 --> 15:29.650
- I don't get that.

15:29.650 --> 15:30.483
- Ow.

15:30.483 --> 15:31.483
Ow.

15:32.347 --> 15:34.197
- What do you mean
they're mic'ed separately?

15:34.198 --> 15:37.267
- You just had a body
mic taken off of you.

15:37.268 --> 15:39.318
- That was a microphone?

15:39.319 --> 15:41.672
- I feel like the planets are aligning.

15:41.673 --> 15:44.872
I had this idea and now we're doing it.

15:44.873 --> 15:46.535
It's like it's what I'm supposed to do

15:46.536 --> 15:50.286
and I am going to do
what I'm supposed to do.

15:53.954 --> 15:57.712
- And they went
to Spokane, Washington.

15:57.713 --> 16:01.880
The Natives call it Spokane,
but that is incorrect.

16:05.316 --> 16:06.923
- We're on a trip.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.768
We're on a trip.

16:08.769 --> 16:09.769
We're free!

16:10.647 --> 16:11.647
We're free!

16:12.604 --> 16:13.604
Sort of.

16:14.454 --> 16:15.287
- Okay.

16:15.288 --> 16:17.731
- We're walking and talking?

16:17.732 --> 16:18.685
- Are we ready?

16:18.685 --> 16:19.685
- Yeah.

16:21.592 --> 16:22.534
- Go.

16:22.535 --> 16:26.300
- My grandmother raised
her three daughters here,

16:26.301 --> 16:28.393
here in Spokane, Washington.

16:28.394 --> 16:32.847
I too was born here, but it's
more than a journey home,

16:32.848 --> 16:35.015
it's a journey to courage.

16:36.963 --> 16:37.796
Yeah?

16:37.796 --> 16:38.629
- And cut it.

16:38.629 --> 16:39.462
Great.

16:39.462 --> 16:40.295
- Okay, cut it.

16:40.295 --> 16:41.128
Will that work.

16:41.128 --> 16:41.961
- That's excellent.

16:41.961 --> 16:42.794
- All right, we'll do
some other crap over here,

16:42.795 --> 16:44.257
maybe get the trees.

16:44.258 --> 16:45.618
That way people know it's Spokane.

16:47.150 --> 16:49.498
It's raining, let's go, let's go!

16:52.079 --> 16:55.816
I'm making kind of a
documentary about, sort of...

16:55.817 --> 16:57.113
- Sorry.

16:57.114 --> 16:58.988
- Female empowerment.

16:58.989 --> 17:01.656
I've always been really inspired

17:03.752 --> 17:05.287
by the women in my family,

17:05.288 --> 17:07.730
and so we're going to uncover that.

17:07.731 --> 17:08.655
- That's good, just keep going.

17:08.656 --> 17:11.444
- All right, all right, honestly
just part of our process,

17:11.444 --> 17:12.412
it's fine.

17:12.413 --> 17:13.493
- Just stand right there.

17:13.494 --> 17:14.910
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

17:14.911 --> 17:16.023
- What, me?

17:16.025 --> 17:17.578
- No, Greg.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.412
- Rolling.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.742
- It's that gonna pick up?

17:19.742 --> 17:21.946
- Don't worry about that.

17:21.948 --> 17:23.499
- You know if I look at
you, you can't be just like,

17:23.500 --> 17:24.781
don't look at me, don't talk to me.

17:24.781 --> 17:26.665
- What am I suppose to interact with you,

17:26.666 --> 17:28.642
you're suppose to, she's the subject.

17:28.643 --> 17:29.476
- Why won't...

17:29.476 --> 17:30.309
- Please.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.355
- I don't think this
interacting is very...

17:31.356 --> 17:32.407
- I'm very sorry, I'm sorry.

17:32.408 --> 17:37.338
- Ivan, we'll be shutting
dawn here in a minute, Ivan.

17:37.339 --> 17:39.190
- Tell me about the day I was born.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.057
- Day you were born...

17:40.057 --> 17:40.890
- Jesus.

17:40.891 --> 17:42.116
- I was 18 years old.

17:42.117 --> 17:42.950
- Who cares?

17:42.950 --> 17:43.783
- And we were in

17:43.783 --> 17:44.616
Long Beach, California.
- I think this is

17:44.616 --> 17:45.449
good stuff.

17:45.449 --> 17:46.282
- Okay, okay.

17:46.283 --> 17:47.760
- Look, maybe if we just had
a quick meeting and got like

17:47.761 --> 17:49.225
how we relate to each other...

17:49.226 --> 17:50.790
- I'm just gonna
take the baby outside.

17:50.791 --> 17:52.252
- Great, fine.

17:52.253 --> 17:54.375
- She's a great producer.

17:54.376 --> 17:56.027
I think we should have
certain ground rules about

17:56.028 --> 17:57.238
how we talk to each other,

17:57.239 --> 17:58.555
and when we talk to each other,

17:58.556 --> 18:00.761
and what respect means in this context.

18:00.762 --> 18:02.662
- I understand, I understand.

18:02.663 --> 18:04.138
I just want you to interview,

18:04.139 --> 18:05.661
you don't have to boom me.

18:05.662 --> 18:06.495
- We're not getting this?

18:06.495 --> 18:07.328
- No.

18:07.329 --> 18:08.355
- Okay, oh this is, this is, oh.

18:08.356 --> 18:10.080
- We're just figuring stuff out.

18:10.081 --> 18:12.277
It's just about her, it's not about us,

18:12.278 --> 18:14.010
so as soon as you're not talking to her,

18:14.011 --> 18:14.943
I'm putting you on track.

18:14.943 --> 18:15.776
- But see when you...

18:15.776 --> 18:16.609
- I'm putting you on track.

18:16.610 --> 18:18.523
- I'm trying to put myself
in the interviewer position,

18:18.524 --> 18:19.924
and when you belittle me in front of her,

18:19.925 --> 18:21.093
then she's not gonna respect me.

18:21.094 --> 18:21.970
- Why are you so sensitive?

18:21.971 --> 18:24.447
I'm not belittling you, I'm
just trying to get at the truth.

18:24.448 --> 18:26.289
- I looked back to see, I
was afraid you would trip,

18:26.290 --> 18:27.418
and I look back and you're instantly like,

18:27.419 --> 18:28.469
"Don't look at us."

18:28.470 --> 18:31.039
- Why are you looking at, we're not,

18:31.040 --> 18:32.020
and now she's not even here.

18:32.021 --> 18:34.223
- Well I'm gonna let the door slam?

18:34.224 --> 18:35.425
- Let's just talk about this later.

18:35.426 --> 18:37.129
- All right, mom.

18:38.304 --> 18:39.274
- What are we doin' here?

18:39.274 --> 18:40.107
- It's okay, boo boo.

18:40.107 --> 18:40.940
- Is she okay?

18:40.941 --> 18:42.023
- She's okay.

18:44.108 --> 18:46.161
- Let's take five, let's take five.

18:46.162 --> 18:47.886
- I think
we're on a five people.

18:47.887 --> 18:49.847
Five everyone.

18:49.848 --> 18:50.681
- What are we doing now?

18:50.682 --> 18:51.748
- Well we're not going to the bathroom,

18:51.749 --> 18:52.843
we're doing that at another time.

18:52.844 --> 18:54.436
- I thought we were broken,
I thought we were stuck.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.142
- You wanna
take this whole thing?

18:56.143 --> 18:57.997
- If there's a lot a
rules that I don't know about.

18:57.998 --> 18:58.853
- Don't yell
at me, don't yell at me.

18:58.853 --> 18:59.786
- Like we don't go to the bathroom,

18:59.787 --> 19:01.280
we don't eat ever.

19:01.281 --> 19:03.205
- I didn't say ever, I just said not now.

19:03.206 --> 19:05.134
- All right, well I
don't exactly understand

19:05.135 --> 19:06.627
when you became the boss.

19:06.628 --> 19:10.388
- As I say in my book,
Indisputable Cinema,

19:10.389 --> 19:12.806
if the filmmaker is invasive,

19:13.859 --> 19:16.109
the subject become evasive.

19:18.338 --> 19:20.490
- I just want you
to go back to that day

19:20.491 --> 19:22.656
when your dad died.

19:22.657 --> 19:24.674
- Honey, I don't
wanna talk about that.

19:24.675 --> 19:26.704
- Mom, it's really important, I just,

19:26.705 --> 19:27.538
this is important to me.

19:27.538 --> 19:28.538
- No.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.858
I think you and your
friends should leave now.

19:33.859 --> 19:34.692
What do we...

19:34.693 --> 19:36.705
Mom, please don't embarrass
me in front of everybody.

19:36.706 --> 19:37.995
This is kind of important to me,

19:37.996 --> 19:38.829
could you just...

19:38.830 --> 19:40.432
- No, Todd.

19:40.433 --> 19:41.433
Leave.

19:42.207 --> 19:44.425
- What exactly
were you thinking, Rod?

19:44.426 --> 19:46.527
I mean we spent, I don't know,

19:46.528 --> 19:48.028
99% of the time
- Shhhh.

19:48.029 --> 19:49.159
Talking to each other.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.264
She's just standing...

19:50.265 --> 19:51.214
- Shh, shh, shh, you guys, shh, shh,

19:51.214 --> 19:52.070
I finally got her to sleep.

19:52.070 --> 19:52.903
- I'm sorry.

19:52.904 --> 19:54.210
- It's like four hours past her bedtime.

19:54.211 --> 19:56.075
- Okay, sorry 'bout that.

19:56.076 --> 19:58.004
We spent all our time
talking to each other,

19:58.005 --> 19:59.152
nothing to her.

19:59.153 --> 20:00.753
There were no questions prepared,

20:00.754 --> 20:03.254
I mean, what exactly happened?

20:04.564 --> 20:05.397
- What do you mean?

20:05.398 --> 20:07.482
This is one day,

20:07.483 --> 20:08.316
one day.

20:08.317 --> 20:11.377
- That went terribly, right?

20:11.378 --> 20:12.211
- It didn't go that bad.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.044
- I don't think so.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.944
- We didn't get any footage.

20:14.945 --> 20:16.508
- Well we're learning to
work together as a team,

20:16.509 --> 20:19.879
we did get a little bit of
footage, I mean the initial.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.692
- We got footage of us
walkin' up to the house.

20:21.693 --> 20:23.725
- I mean that, the initial contact.

20:23.726 --> 20:26.491
- Initially when you talked
to her, Rod, what did she say?

20:26.492 --> 20:28.561
Beforehand, saying we're coming up,

20:28.562 --> 20:29.988
we're gonna talk to you, what,

20:29.989 --> 20:31.742
she was like, "Yeah, I'm
happy to talk to you."

20:31.743 --> 20:32.576
- To my mother?

20:32.576 --> 20:33.409
- Yeah.

20:33.410 --> 20:34.528
- I didn't talk to my mother.

20:34.529 --> 20:36.616
- That wasn't your mother today?

20:36.617 --> 20:39.049
- I think I just gotta pull myself back,

20:39.050 --> 20:40.884
be less of a perfectionist,

20:40.885 --> 20:44.859
and, you know just go
with the flow a little.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.087
- This is guerrilla filmmaking,

20:46.088 --> 20:48.255
we just jump out, we just,

20:49.337 --> 20:51.004
it's like a gorilla.

20:56.462 --> 20:58.171
- Hi, is Shirley there?

20:58.172 --> 21:00.706
I wanna do a documentary
about the women in my family.

21:00.707 --> 21:04.349
So we're gonna be spending
some time with you

21:04.350 --> 21:05.183
in the near future.

21:05.184 --> 21:06.239
- Could we get cleaned up first?

21:06.240 --> 21:08.346
- We're really creating
something important,

21:08.347 --> 21:09.930
something American.

21:11.425 --> 21:13.758
Something that my grandkids,

21:17.440 --> 21:22.115
assuming I get married
and kids then, all that.

21:22.116 --> 21:24.900
That they could sort
of hold on to, and say,

21:24.901 --> 21:26.584
hold up, and say,

21:26.585 --> 21:28.085
"This is something

21:29.501 --> 21:33.091
"that my relative was involved in."

21:33.092 --> 21:34.686
- Oh, my cousin Marcy's here.

21:34.687 --> 21:36.239
- Upstairs, it'll be easier.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.073
- Oh Marcy.

21:37.073 --> 21:37.906
- Marcy's here.

21:37.906 --> 21:38.739
- Hi.

21:38.740 --> 21:40.802
- I really am
not, I'm not ready here.

21:40.803 --> 21:43.526
- We're making a documentary
about female empowerment.

21:43.527 --> 21:44.772
- Do you have
anythings you wanna...

21:44.773 --> 21:45.885
- Probably won't involve you,

21:45.886 --> 21:46.912
but say hi to everyone.

21:46.913 --> 21:47.752
- Hi.

21:47.753 --> 21:48.800
- Tell your name.

21:48.801 --> 21:50.606
- Hi, I'm Marcy.

21:50.607 --> 21:51.756
- This is my cousin Marcy.

21:51.757 --> 21:52.590
- I'm Todd's cousin.

21:52.590 --> 21:53.534
- And you live down here, yeah?

21:53.535 --> 21:54.576
- Yeah, but I gotta get
ready to go to work, so.

21:54.577 --> 21:56.308
- So I bet you're
happy to get rid of it.

21:56.309 --> 21:57.772
Where do you work?

21:57.773 --> 21:59.597
- I'm workin' at Walgreens.

21:59.598 --> 22:00.431
- You work at Walgreens.

22:00.431 --> 22:01.264
- Yeah.

22:01.264 --> 22:02.097
- Why...

22:02.097 --> 22:03.097
- Ready?

22:04.088 --> 22:05.957
- No, why, why are we
doing this with the boom?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.218
- Well, because I thought
you guys didn't want,

22:08.219 --> 22:09.590
I don't have a mixer.

22:09.591 --> 22:13.758
What a mixer can do is, you
can mic every different person

22:14.920 --> 22:18.411
sort of individually, and
then as a sound professional

22:18.412 --> 22:22.162
I can go in and what
they call mix the sound.

22:24.413 --> 22:27.277
And I can turn certain people
down and turn other people up.

22:27.278 --> 22:29.965
Whereas right now what we're
doing, we just have this one,

22:29.966 --> 22:31.896
it's called a boom mic,

22:31.897 --> 22:33.688
and we just have that one mic,

22:33.689 --> 22:36.399
and it sorta picks up all
the sound and then you can't

22:36.400 --> 22:38.326
what they call, mix it.

22:38.327 --> 22:39.722
Or un-mix it.

22:39.723 --> 22:41.783
You can't, you don't have any choices.

22:41.784 --> 22:45.158
And, as an artist I need
choices on my palette.

22:45.159 --> 22:46.384
- You gotta lean back a little for me.

22:46.385 --> 22:47.218
- All right.

22:47.218 --> 22:48.161
So this is just, this
is gonna be very simple,

22:48.162 --> 22:50.668
we're just gonna do some simple things.

22:50.669 --> 22:51.502
- Has to be simple.

22:51.502 --> 22:52.335
- Few questions.

22:52.335 --> 22:53.210
- Has to be simple.

22:53.211 --> 22:57.417
- So what would you
say is the meaning of life,

22:57.418 --> 22:59.585
from a female perspective?

23:01.545 --> 23:05.712
- Well, gee
honey, it's just living

23:07.538 --> 23:10.455
the way you can and doing well, and

23:12.604 --> 23:14.505
as you go through generations

23:14.506 --> 23:17.078
everything changes occur.

23:17.079 --> 23:19.151
First you're a teenager,
then you're a baby,

23:19.152 --> 23:21.678
and then you're older, and
then you have nothing to do.

23:21.679 --> 23:25.523
- Yeah, but how's that pertain
to a woman in particular?

23:25.524 --> 23:27.491
Kind of have a woman focus to this thing.

23:27.492 --> 23:30.575
- Well, my life has always been just,

23:31.691 --> 23:33.370
you know nothing special.

23:33.371 --> 23:37.538
Just that I always had, never
had anything bad happen.

23:38.590 --> 23:39.590
Never had any tough times.

23:39.591 --> 23:41.574
- Oh that's not true, you've
never had anything bad happen.

23:41.575 --> 23:42.955
There were some bad things that happened.

23:42.956 --> 23:46.236
What are some obstacles, some struggles

23:46.237 --> 23:48.088
you've had to overcome, come on.

23:48.089 --> 23:51.517
- Well course the kids'
father, he passed away,

23:51.518 --> 23:52.972
that wasn't a good thing.

23:52.973 --> 23:53.955
He was in the service.

23:53.955 --> 23:54.862
- How did that go?

23:54.863 --> 23:56.005
What happened exactly?

23:56.006 --> 23:57.485
- Well, what happened to him...

23:57.486 --> 23:58.661
- Greg boom, Greg.

23:58.662 --> 24:01.870
That we felt he had an accident.

24:01.871 --> 24:05.341
- This group, whenever they
begin to uncover a story,

24:05.342 --> 24:09.207
they shoot themselves
in the proverbial ass.

24:09.208 --> 24:14.104
- So it's your feeling that
Curly had an accident, yeah?

24:14.105 --> 24:16.549
- Yes, it is, but he probably had...

24:16.550 --> 24:17.507
- Hold please.

24:17.508 --> 24:19.490
- Wait, wait, wait, but ma ma, Greg.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.135
- We got a plane goin' over.

24:21.136 --> 24:21.969
- What?

24:21.969 --> 24:22.802
- Honestly, do you hear a plane?

24:22.802 --> 24:23.635
- Yeah, I hear a plane.

24:23.635 --> 24:24.468
- Shh, shh.

24:24.469 --> 24:25.698
- I don't hear any plane.

24:25.699 --> 24:27.111
- This wouldn't be a
problem if I had a mixer,

24:27.112 --> 24:28.895
we could use the little body mics

24:28.896 --> 24:31.429
and I wouldn't have to be
pickin' in up with this, but.

24:31.430 --> 24:33.314
- Greg there's no
plane, that was the wind.

24:33.315 --> 24:34.490
- You're gonna
campaign for a mixer now,

24:34.491 --> 24:35.324
that's your idea...

24:35.325 --> 24:36.332
- Don't make stuff up.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.083
- I just want it to be as
good as it can be, right?

24:38.084 --> 24:38.917
- All right, can we please...

24:38.917 --> 24:39.750
- Tryin' to do my job...

24:39.751 --> 24:41.320
- Shouldn't make
up aircraft for that purpose.

24:41.321 --> 24:42.469
- I'm not makin' it up...

24:42.470 --> 24:43.303
- Hey Marcy.

24:43.304 --> 24:44.880
- Didn't you hear a plane?

24:44.881 --> 24:46.827
- Marcy, what are you
doin', you're back already.

24:46.828 --> 24:48.388
- I live here, what are you doing here?

24:49.691 --> 24:50.849
- She does.

24:50.850 --> 24:52.057
I do.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.320
- Poor kid, it's
time to get somethin' to eat

24:53.321 --> 24:54.154
and you're...

24:54.155 --> 24:56.146
- Well but,
you're just home already.

24:56.147 --> 25:00.050
- I know, I know, I was
done early, so yeah,

25:00.051 --> 25:03.248
so I'm just gonna be downstairs.

25:03.249 --> 25:04.393
- Well we're
doing a documentary about

25:04.394 --> 25:05.595
the women in my family.

25:05.596 --> 25:08.025
I was hoping to get some
stuff of you, you know.

25:08.026 --> 25:09.324
- The women in your family.

25:09.325 --> 25:10.822
- Well, yeah.

25:10.823 --> 25:12.101
- So you're interview grandma?

25:12.102 --> 25:12.935
- Yeah.

25:12.935 --> 25:13.768
- That's good.

25:13.768 --> 25:14.601
Good, good, good.

25:14.601 --> 25:15.434
- What about you?

25:15.435 --> 25:18.592
- I'm not, I would rather
just, I'll just be downstairs.

25:18.593 --> 25:21.571
But you can come down
afterwards and maybe we can go

25:21.572 --> 25:22.859
grab a drink or somethin' later on.

25:22.860 --> 25:23.693
Do you have time?

25:23.693 --> 25:24.526
Are you leaving right away?

25:24.526 --> 25:25.417
- Yeah, no, no, I'm not leaving.

25:25.418 --> 25:26.882
- You look good by the way,
I really like.

25:26.883 --> 25:27.716
- Oh, thanks.

25:27.717 --> 25:28.717
- Do you have time?

25:28.718 --> 25:29.905
- Yeah, sure, sure.

25:29.906 --> 25:32.154
- Okay, cool, cool, you guys
can come if you want to.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.661
- We'll talk about it,

25:34.662 --> 25:37.037
and maybe I'll get you to participate.

25:37.038 --> 25:39.203
- Ah-ha, yeah, I don't think so.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.131
See you later, bye.

25:40.132 --> 25:41.331
- All right, thanks.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.345
- Can we get back to the interview?

25:42.346 --> 25:44.422
- How is she home from work already?

25:44.423 --> 25:46.756
- A fist rots from the head.

25:48.894 --> 25:51.144
And so does Marcy.

25:51.145 --> 25:54.812
She's like a troll
dwelling in the basement.

25:56.084 --> 25:57.178
- She's very secretive.

25:57.179 --> 25:58.774
She probably has a problem that

25:58.775 --> 26:01.960
maybe she will tell us later, maybe never.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.044
She works short hours and

26:05.294 --> 26:07.117
so she obviously

26:07.118 --> 26:08.599
needs something better in her life,

26:08.600 --> 26:11.336
and I think that she could
get something better.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.774
- She's living in
the basement here, yeah?

26:12.775 --> 26:14.574
- Yes, and maybe,

26:14.575 --> 26:17.228
I wouldn't like to have
her hear me discuss this,

26:17.229 --> 26:18.980
shall we go outside a minute?

26:18.981 --> 26:21.069
I'll show you my flowers.

26:21.070 --> 26:24.490
'Kay now Todd, you know
that Marcy's having trouble.

26:24.491 --> 26:25.324
So if you wanna...

26:25.325 --> 26:26.453
- Can you read lips?

26:26.454 --> 26:28.040
- Not so good.

26:28.041 --> 26:29.518
- Since you're
making this documentary,

26:29.519 --> 26:31.408
that maybe there was a little
something she could do.

26:31.409 --> 26:34.390
Just to get her on the right
direction in another area.

26:34.391 --> 26:36.608
- This isn't a game we're
playing, I can't ju...

26:36.609 --> 26:38.847
People have jobs, she's not a filmmaker.

26:38.848 --> 26:39.932
I can't give her a job.

26:39.933 --> 26:40.965
- Uh like banana.

26:40.966 --> 26:41.799
- Um.

26:41.799 --> 26:42.644
- You either get her a job,

26:42.645 --> 26:44.032
or grandma's gonna have to get tough

26:44.033 --> 26:47.480
and I'm not doing your documentary.

26:47.481 --> 26:48.419
- Are you out a your mind, what?

26:48.420 --> 26:49.766
What is she gonna do?

26:49.767 --> 26:51.188
- Does she have any experience?

26:51.189 --> 26:52.839
- No, she doesn't have any experience.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.022
- She's just gonna get in the way.

26:54.023 --> 26:56.864
- This is not ideal and I apologize,

26:56.865 --> 26:58.224
but I don't see where we have a choice...

26:58.225 --> 26:59.058
- I don't want her around.

26:59.059 --> 27:00.547
- My grandmother controls everything.

27:00.548 --> 27:01.381
She's not gonna participate...

27:01.381 --> 27:02.269
- Come on Rod, be a man.

27:02.270 --> 27:03.649
We don't need, we've got,

27:03.650 --> 27:06.184
we don't have any extra
tasks for her to do.

27:06.185 --> 27:07.587
I mean it doesn't make any sense.

27:07.588 --> 27:08.622
- I really would appreciate
if you guys could

27:08.623 --> 27:11.484
see your way clear to
helping me out with this.

27:11.485 --> 27:13.525
- We are helping you out by saying no.

27:13.526 --> 27:14.359
- My hands are tied.

27:14.359 --> 27:15.192
- Absolutely.

27:15.193 --> 27:16.674
- We don't need her.

27:16.675 --> 27:17.508
- What?

27:17.509 --> 27:18.708
- Would it be okay if she was
like an intern or something?

27:18.709 --> 27:20.025
- Well, are you gonna pay her?

27:20.026 --> 27:21.248
- Maybe you'd do it, or something.

27:21.249 --> 27:22.613
- Maybe I'd volunteer.

27:22.614 --> 27:23.950
- As long as you don't pay her.

27:23.951 --> 27:28.062
I'm not gettin', how much
are you getting paid?

27:28.063 --> 27:29.469
- It's not important, I think...

27:29.470 --> 27:31.463
- We need, I need a mixer.

27:31.464 --> 27:32.963
- Who are we kidding, this is a disaster.

27:32.964 --> 27:34.098
This whole thing is a disaster.

27:34.099 --> 27:36.022
- It's not, it's going great, Todd.

27:36.023 --> 27:37.716
No, you're doing really well.

27:37.717 --> 27:41.044
I think the stuff we've
shot already is great.

27:41.045 --> 27:42.045
Yeah.

27:42.772 --> 27:45.860
- I don't her touching me.

27:45.861 --> 27:46.946
- It's not gonna be a nightmare.

27:46.947 --> 27:47.780
- Hi.

27:47.780 --> 27:48.613
- What?

27:48.614 --> 27:51.077
- I'm sorry, hi, I'm sorry, I didn't wanna

27:51.078 --> 27:53.566
disturb you guys, but, would
you mind, could you just,

27:53.567 --> 27:55.253
you see that bottle, the
Valerian root right there

27:55.254 --> 27:56.754
on the lazy Susan?

27:58.466 --> 27:59.607
Could you just hand that to me?

27:59.608 --> 28:02.004
I'm so sorry, I know you
guys were having a meeting,

28:02.005 --> 28:02.849
and I didn't wanna...

28:02.849 --> 28:03.682
- It's okay.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.515
- Thank you so much.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.475
- Sure thing, yeah.

28:07.476 --> 28:08.309
Jesus Christ,

28:08.310 --> 28:09.416
- Taking sleeping
pills at 2 o'clock?

28:09.417 --> 28:10.591
- Is she a phantom?

28:10.592 --> 28:12.759
- Look, this is the thing.

28:13.969 --> 28:16.073
In something like this,
there's a hierarchy.

28:16.074 --> 28:17.243
And this is it.

28:17.244 --> 28:20.542
I'm the leader, I'm
giving the word on this.

28:20.543 --> 28:21.762
Marcy's involved.

28:21.763 --> 28:24.118
We're gonna move on to
the next thing, okay?

28:24.119 --> 28:26.397
So let's move on to the
next shot, out in the yard.

28:26.398 --> 28:29.065
We're done, thank you very much.

28:32.658 --> 28:33.491
- I think it'll be okay.

28:33.491 --> 28:34.335
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:34.335 --> 28:35.299
- She's family.

28:35.299 --> 28:36.132
- Totally.

28:36.133 --> 28:38.188
- It's sort a part a the story.

28:38.189 --> 28:40.265
- Yeah, I think we'll be fine.

28:40.266 --> 28:42.535
- Yeah, it's gonna be great, just great.

28:42.536 --> 28:44.891
- I'm so touched that he would
want me to be a part of it.

28:44.892 --> 28:48.418
I kind of thought maybe he
was gonna ask me when I,

28:48.419 --> 28:49.492
I kinda thought maybe he would,

28:49.493 --> 28:50.759
because he's always been talkin' about us

28:50.760 --> 28:51.794
workin' on something together.

28:51.795 --> 28:53.227
Or he did, we did, when we were little,

28:53.228 --> 28:54.785
talked about working
on something together.

28:54.786 --> 28:59.269
- I think it will help morale,
if she's not part of it.

28:59.270 --> 29:02.103
- Well, I think if she stays away,

29:02.983 --> 29:05.338
and you know what, I
was thinking about that,

29:05.339 --> 29:07.286
how you wanted that mixer,
and I wasn't quite sure...

29:07.287 --> 29:08.120
- The sound mixer.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.319
- Yeah, in terms of if
we can afford that, and

29:10.320 --> 29:12.017
I think we can.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.172
- I think it's probably
gonna be all right to

29:13.173 --> 29:14.825
have Marcy around, actually.

29:14.826 --> 29:19.066
Because one thing she does
have is a lot of enthusiasm.

29:19.067 --> 29:23.234
And, my dad always said
that that's what I needed.

29:24.923 --> 29:25.759
- What are some things that

29:25.760 --> 29:28.744
you've had to overcome in your life?

29:28.745 --> 29:32.912
- So when I found out my
husband had a girlfriend.

29:35.291 --> 29:36.124
- I didn't know that.

29:36.125 --> 29:37.210
- I was pretty stressed out.

29:37.211 --> 29:38.221
- I never knew that.

29:38.222 --> 29:39.520
- I had a friend who went to church,

29:39.521 --> 29:41.006
so I went and talked to her pastor,

29:41.007 --> 29:44.245
and he explained to me
that we're all sinners.

29:44.246 --> 29:47.538
- Say something profound, Rod.

29:47.539 --> 29:49.783
- That's great.

29:49.784 --> 29:51.059
- We don't need you this close.

29:51.060 --> 29:52.764
- Well I can't zoom if I'm back there.

29:52.765 --> 29:54.969
- How 'bout losing the glasses.

29:54.970 --> 29:56.242
- Well I can't see if I
don't have my glasses.

29:56.243 --> 29:57.853
- It doesn't matter.

29:57.854 --> 30:00.475
Don't worry about focus,
we'll do that in post.

30:00.476 --> 30:01.452
Just go in the...

30:01.453 --> 30:02.501
- You add the focus afterwards?

30:02.502 --> 30:04.395
- That's right, go in the back.

30:04.396 --> 30:06.884
- I think they're gonna be very, very glad

30:06.885 --> 30:08.631
that they have me.

30:08.632 --> 30:09.879
'Cause I think I got
some things that I know

30:09.880 --> 30:11.106
that he wasn't covering.

30:11.107 --> 30:12.297
I could see some things
that he wasn't covering

30:12.298 --> 30:13.131
that I was getting.

30:13.132 --> 30:15.107
And I was getting some
very interesting angles.

30:15.108 --> 30:17.068
- I don't know how many
times, just up, up,

30:17.069 --> 30:17.902
I don't want you

30:17.902 --> 30:18.735
getting filmed.
- How wide are we,

30:18.736 --> 30:20.175
are we wide or tight?

30:20.176 --> 30:21.009
- We're tight.

30:21.009 --> 30:21.842
- We're tight?

30:21.842 --> 30:22.675
- But not that tight.

30:22.675 --> 30:23.508
- Well if we're tight...

30:23.508 --> 30:24.341
- I think Brandon's great.

30:24.342 --> 30:25.525
I think he's got his shit together.

30:25.526 --> 30:26.975
I think he's got his stuff together.

30:26.976 --> 30:29.409
I think that, I'm not really
sure about the sound guy.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.092
What's the sound guy's name again?

30:31.093 --> 30:34.059
- Hey I know, Brandon, here's a good idea.

30:34.060 --> 30:37.071
I'll stand over here,
and I won't be in it.

30:37.072 --> 30:37.905
- He's joking, right?

30:37.906 --> 30:41.827
- For sure, behind the tree, okay?

30:41.828 --> 30:44.304
- Um, I might have to learn sound.

30:44.305 --> 30:47.805
- You are on everybody's ass all the time.

30:48.698 --> 30:50.295
It makes everyone

30:50.296 --> 30:51.227
feel bad.
- Look, if you're

30:51.228 --> 30:52.472
frustrated with how this is
- It makes less

30:52.473 --> 30:53.687
- Going.

30:53.688 --> 30:54.521
- Of everybody.

30:54.522 --> 30:56.386
- Don't take it out on me, okay?

30:56.387 --> 30:59.321
Well, I just think
there's a way of behaving.

30:59.322 --> 31:00.322
Ozer,

31:01.439 --> 31:03.216
Errol Morris,

31:03.217 --> 31:04.050
the big guy,

31:04.051 --> 31:06.160
the big documentary
guys, they don't do that.

31:06.161 --> 31:08.779
They respect the subject.

31:08.780 --> 31:12.384
They let the subject go
where he or she wants.

31:12.385 --> 31:15.646
They don't force it, and
they don't blow up like that.

31:15.647 --> 31:16.630
- I think we're gonna,

31:16.631 --> 31:19.331
we're gonna stop for a little while.

31:19.332 --> 31:20.165
For just a little while.

31:20.166 --> 31:21.963
And don't you pipe up, please.

31:21.964 --> 31:23.047
Jesus Christ.

31:24.648 --> 31:28.815
- Yeah, there's a little
tension on the set, yeah.

31:30.554 --> 31:32.214
- Greg's a project.

31:32.215 --> 31:34.061
He's worked on a lot
a commercials with me,

31:34.062 --> 31:37.562
but never sound, never anything important.

31:39.254 --> 31:43.165
He's primarily, I wouldn't
call him a gopher,

31:43.166 --> 31:47.735
but he does multiple projects
that have limited risk.

31:47.736 --> 31:48.569
- Ooh!

31:48.570 --> 31:50.048
- It may not always look like
we know what we're doing.

31:50.049 --> 31:51.477
And in fact, to tell you the truth,

31:51.478 --> 31:53.112
we may not know what we're doing.

31:53.113 --> 31:54.280
But, it's like

31:55.577 --> 31:57.890
Joseph, Joseph Stalin,

31:57.891 --> 32:01.871
or whoever that, said, follow your bliss.

32:01.872 --> 32:05.285
- Did he tell you about
the cat litter story?

32:05.286 --> 32:07.888
He's probably gonna kill
me for telling you this.

32:07.889 --> 32:09.696
I'm sure, if you just don't tell him that,

32:09.697 --> 32:11.016
well he probably will know eventually

32:11.017 --> 32:12.548
when he sees it on the.

32:12.549 --> 32:16.420
But, he ate the cat poop
outta the cat litter

32:16.421 --> 32:17.792
when he was a little kid.

32:17.793 --> 32:19.640
He was always going after it, you know.

32:19.641 --> 32:21.855
I'm always like slappin'
his hand away, say,

32:21.856 --> 32:24.140
"You can't eat the cat
poop outta the cat litter."

32:24.141 --> 32:26.509
- Someone like Todd, I
feel like he's sort of,

32:26.510 --> 32:28.740
he's like taking a lot
of risks in his life,

32:28.741 --> 32:29.991
and he kind of,

32:32.927 --> 32:35.682
I don't know, he's following
his heart, or his dream.

32:35.683 --> 32:38.408
And it's just really
inspirational to me, I guess.

32:38.409 --> 32:42.345
'Cause I sort of, haven't
always done that, I don't know.

32:42.346 --> 32:43.323
Whatever.

32:43.324 --> 32:47.073
- When you're making
art, it can be that way.

32:50.198 --> 32:52.198
It has to hurt a little.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.421
Hurts a little.

32:54.422 --> 32:56.426
- The only person who
is more inspiring to me

32:56.427 --> 32:58.992
than Todd as an artist,

32:58.993 --> 33:01.654
is Franz, the sound man.

33:01.655 --> 33:05.494
Your sound man, who I think
is an artist with sound.

33:05.495 --> 33:07.328
Have you got a second?

33:09.514 --> 33:12.347
Can I ask you just a couple, like,

33:13.752 --> 33:16.546
there's these knobs here,

33:16.547 --> 33:20.047
this one's for ch 1, and then I have ch 2.

33:21.989 --> 33:23.572
It goes up to ch 5.

33:26.674 --> 33:27.550
I'll figure it out.

33:27.551 --> 33:29.336
This is a sweet baby.

33:29.337 --> 33:30.956
- Where are you from?

33:30.957 --> 33:32.140
- That's a sweet baby.

33:32.141 --> 33:35.058
- I'm from Arizona with these guys.

33:36.269 --> 33:38.847
- Right, right, right, you're
all from Arizona, I forgot.

33:38.848 --> 33:40.054
- Yep.

33:40.055 --> 33:41.536
- Yeah, I heard that's very nice there.

33:41.537 --> 33:43.490
I was gonna go there one time.

33:43.491 --> 33:45.023
- Really, that's great.

33:45.024 --> 33:47.619
- Never quiet made it but,

33:47.620 --> 33:49.037
I heard it was really, really great.

33:49.038 --> 33:49.871
I'd like to go.

33:49.872 --> 33:53.270
Maybe I'll come visit you
guys down there sometime.

33:53.271 --> 33:54.104
- Uh.

33:54.105 --> 33:55.831
- You know, like in post,
when we're doing post,

33:55.832 --> 33:56.832
or whatever.

33:58.508 --> 34:00.891
- You could check it
out now if you wanted.

34:00.892 --> 34:02.919
- I'm a little tired, I'm
running a little jet lag,

34:02.920 --> 34:06.336
and I worry about the baby,
is she okay and stuff.

34:06.337 --> 34:08.860
She's a little tired.

34:08.862 --> 34:11.589
It's an adventure for her
though, so I think that's good,

34:11.590 --> 34:13.790
but I just, I'm just protective of her

34:13.791 --> 34:15.146
and I wanna make sure she's okay.

34:15.147 --> 34:19.087
But I mean in terms of the
film, it seems to be going well.

34:19.088 --> 34:21.373
I just think the footage that
we've got is really good.

34:24.094 --> 34:26.067
You want an orange, boo boo?

34:26.068 --> 34:28.370
You want an orange?

34:29.205 --> 34:30.217
- Oh, oh, oh.

34:30.219 --> 34:32.958
- I'm so sorry, so sorry.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.618
That's with having no alcohol.

34:34.619 --> 34:36.782
See what's gonna happen if I have it?

34:36.783 --> 34:38.623
I don't know, it's sort
of like he married like an

34:38.625 --> 34:41.456
idea or something, of me, not like me.

34:41.458 --> 34:44.629
I don't know, it sounds so cliche but,

34:44.630 --> 34:47.239
sometimes cliches, it's like true.

34:47.241 --> 34:49.751
So you just like say it, and whatever.

34:49.752 --> 34:51.196
- Well you're right,
it wouldn't be a cliche...

34:51.197 --> 34:52.623
- I said whatever
like 68 times in the

34:52.623 --> 34:54.693
last like ten minutes.

34:54.694 --> 34:56.246
I just said it again.

34:56.246 --> 34:59.747
When was your last long term relationship?

35:02.409 --> 35:03.409
- I mean...

35:06.583 --> 35:08.401
- You're think like really hard.

35:08.402 --> 35:10.235
I was a long time ago.

35:11.402 --> 35:13.004
I'm just kidding, I'm
sorry, that was kinda mean.

35:13.005 --> 35:15.670
- I don't, no, listen, I what
I, look, look, look, look.

35:15.671 --> 35:16.606
- I'm like no one to talk,

35:16.607 --> 35:17.607
and I was in this terrible
marriage, and I...

35:17.608 --> 35:19.742
- I don't wanna make a
freak of myself, but I...

35:19.743 --> 35:22.526
- No it's, I'm likely the freaky story,

35:22.527 --> 35:24.543
and I'm like madam freak.

35:24.544 --> 35:27.321
- I've never had a relationship.

35:27.322 --> 35:28.946
- Really?

35:28.947 --> 35:30.608
- When I was doin' it I'd
find that there was a whole

35:30.609 --> 35:32.137
lot a treble, and you kinda need to,

35:32.138 --> 35:35.805
so if you just bring
it down, just a little.

35:36.981 --> 35:39.284
I understand man, it's cool.

35:39.285 --> 35:40.535
You're the man.

35:41.736 --> 35:44.736
Can I get a beer for my friend here.

35:48.460 --> 35:50.377
- You have pretty hair.

35:52.587 --> 35:55.778
- You're.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.034
- I've always thought that.

35:58.035 --> 36:01.167
And today, I was pretend to be asleep

36:01.168 --> 36:03.651
but I wasn't really asleep,

36:03.652 --> 36:04.885
and you put your head on my shoulder and

36:04.886 --> 36:06.803
I kinda leaned over and

36:07.889 --> 36:10.566
your hair smells nice too.

36:10.567 --> 36:12.650
- I wasn't asleep either.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.950
- It's something about the smell,

36:18.973 --> 36:22.140
it smelled the same when we were kids.

36:23.470 --> 36:25.108
Hair.

36:25.109 --> 36:29.232
- Yeah, it's kinda cool, we're
just grabbin' some drinks

36:29.233 --> 36:30.483
and bonding and

36:31.856 --> 36:35.089
connecting with Rebecca, which is great.

36:35.090 --> 36:38.350
'Cause I feel there's
kind of a vibe there.

36:38.351 --> 36:39.350
- Rosanne never talked to her.

36:39.351 --> 36:40.737
- You used to love
the John Davidson show.

36:40.738 --> 36:43.045
- My first sexual
dream was about John Davidson.

36:43.046 --> 36:43.879
- Really?

36:43.879 --> 36:44.712
- Really?

36:44.713 --> 36:45.854
I would say that's probably
true for a lot of people.

36:45.855 --> 36:46.994
- Shh, you think, really?

36:46.995 --> 36:47.838
- Yeah, probably.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.827
- God I had a sexy dream
about John Davidson.

36:49.828 --> 36:51.644
We were kissing in this dream.

36:51.645 --> 36:52.914
- Oh my God.

36:52.915 --> 36:54.081
- Who's John Davidson?

36:54.082 --> 36:54.915
- Oh my God.

36:54.916 --> 36:56.402
- John Davidson, he
had this fabulous hair.

36:56.403 --> 36:57.619
- What are you doing with
this young city woman?

36:57.620 --> 36:59.228
- You don't
know who John Davidson is?

36:59.229 --> 37:01.544
- See, John Davidson, he's great,

37:01.545 --> 37:04.440
people know who John Davidson is.

37:04.441 --> 37:05.359
You know?

37:05.359 --> 37:06.305
- He had a talk show?

37:06.305 --> 37:07.138
- Yes.

37:07.138 --> 37:08.098
Do you know who John Davidson is?

37:08.099 --> 37:09.617
- Joan Rivers had a
talk show, she's funny.

37:09.618 --> 37:10.975
- He doesn't know who John Davidson is.

37:10.976 --> 37:12.467
You're of a different generation.

37:12.468 --> 37:13.396
These young children.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.478
- It's gettin' a little
late, don't you think?

37:16.479 --> 37:17.793
- Yeah, one more round a darts

37:17.794 --> 37:19.606
and we'll be ready to go.

37:19.607 --> 37:21.634
- He was attractive in
a wholesome sort of way.

37:21.635 --> 37:22.849
I would say, wouldn't you?

37:22.850 --> 37:23.683
- Yeah.

37:23.684 --> 37:26.233
- Like who, like who else,

37:26.234 --> 37:27.067
- I don't know.

37:27.067 --> 37:28.017
- Charles Landon?

37:28.017 --> 37:28.850
- It's really late.

37:28.850 --> 37:29.683
- Yeah.

37:29.683 --> 37:30.516
- Michael Landon.

37:30.516 --> 37:31.349
- Michael Landon.

37:31.349 --> 37:32.182
He played Charles...

37:32.183 --> 37:34.897
- You can go home, I mean
you can always catch the bus.

37:34.898 --> 37:36.319
- And Charles in Charge.

37:36.320 --> 37:41.267
- I don't know why I just get
attached to these people and

37:41.268 --> 37:43.851
I kind of wanna take them home,

37:45.723 --> 37:47.758
and enjoy them.

37:47.759 --> 37:48.592
- What does that...

37:48.592 --> 37:49.425
- G-O.

37:49.425 --> 37:50.258
- What is that from?

37:50.259 --> 37:51.915
- G-O, it's from Bingo,
that's all it's from.

37:51.916 --> 37:53.282
- I know Bingo was his name.

37:53.283 --> 37:54.283
B-I.

37:55.182 --> 37:57.475
Did you start with the O, B-I-N-G...

37:57.476 --> 38:01.393
- No, you, once you get
to the end it's like O,

38:03.704 --> 38:04.537
O.

38:04.538 --> 38:05.599
- Oh, but does is go...

38:05.600 --> 38:07.067
- O.

38:07.068 --> 38:09.046
- Oh pansy ass,
that's like an offensive term,

38:09.047 --> 38:10.359
I don't know why.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.786
- Why, oh 'cause
a pansy's a pansy...

38:11.787 --> 38:13.204
- That's for you.

38:14.243 --> 38:15.076
- I don't know...

38:15.077 --> 38:16.733
- except this friend of mine
who likes to say these things

38:16.734 --> 38:18.234
that are kind of outrageous so,

38:18.235 --> 38:20.727
and I just said it now, I
don't even know whether I...

38:20.728 --> 38:21.926
- People are so careful.

38:21.927 --> 38:23.101
- That's true.

38:23.102 --> 38:24.426
I mean, I don't mean anything by it.

38:24.427 --> 38:27.743
- Sometimes I wish people
weren't so careful, you know?

38:27.744 --> 38:29.994
- Yeah, you're not careful.

38:48.459 --> 38:49.792
- I'm so stupid.

38:53.625 --> 38:54.754
I don't know, babies need schedules,

38:54.755 --> 38:56.006
and they need to be able to take naps,

38:56.007 --> 38:57.914
and like I can't function
on four hours sleep,

38:57.915 --> 39:00.139
it's just, I don't know,

39:00.140 --> 39:03.039
I feel so guilty, like this
isn't the place necessarily

39:03.040 --> 39:04.040
for a baby.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.663
I just feel like it's not fair to her.

39:07.935 --> 39:09.815
- Is it one a those kinda
like behind the eye things,

39:09.816 --> 39:12.504
or like back here,
throbby, throbby, throbby.

39:12.505 --> 39:14.167
- It's sort of like, all over.

39:14.168 --> 39:15.373
- Really?

39:15.374 --> 39:17.525
That's what happens
when you drink too much.

39:17.526 --> 39:19.761
- Yeah, guess so.

39:19.762 --> 39:23.845
- You know for what it's
worth, which is nothing,

39:25.191 --> 39:26.592
I'm sorry, all right.

39:26.593 --> 39:27.767
- Oh no, it's not your fault.

39:27.768 --> 39:28.601
I mean you have a schedule.

39:28.602 --> 39:30.429
You're shooting a movie here.

39:30.430 --> 39:33.993
I just don't know if it's
the right place for a baby.

39:33.994 --> 39:36.508
I don't know, I'm just tired.

39:49.980 --> 39:52.387
- Just learning from you has been great.

39:52.388 --> 39:54.949
- I appreciate that, I think you're,

39:54.950 --> 39:56.331
you're comin' along pretty well too.

39:56.332 --> 39:57.699
- Yeah, you think?

39:57.700 --> 40:00.699
- Yeah, kinda thrown into it, and you...

40:00.700 --> 40:02.422
- I feel like I have a knack for it.

40:02.423 --> 40:03.283
- Oh yeah.

40:03.284 --> 40:04.316
- I do.

40:04.317 --> 40:05.150
- Delicious.

40:05.150 --> 40:06.150
- So tired.

40:07.899 --> 40:08.732
- Who's that?

40:08.733 --> 40:10.408
- I'm sorry, 'cuse
me, 'cuse me, sorry.

40:10.409 --> 40:11.263
- What's that?

40:11.263 --> 40:12.182
What's happening?

40:12.183 --> 40:14.341
- I don't
think we've met him yet.

40:14.342 --> 40:15.175
- Hi.

40:15.176 --> 40:16.369
- Yeah, hi, I think your doorbell,

40:16.370 --> 40:17.280
something's wrong with it.

40:17.281 --> 40:18.813
- Excuse me,
hey, hey, hello, hello.

40:18.814 --> 40:19.712
- Hi, hi.

40:19.713 --> 40:22.482
- Hey, come on, let's go.

40:22.483 --> 40:23.916
Oh, you turned the baby against me,

40:23.917 --> 40:25.182
that's wonderful, let's go, come on.

40:25.183 --> 40:26.654
- Hey, hey, I'm sorry, excuse me.

40:26.655 --> 40:28.765
- Fine, bye, bye, it's fine.

40:28.766 --> 40:30.719
- Listen, hey, hey.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.952
- We have a plane we have to catch.

40:31.953 --> 40:33.296
- Can we talk for just a...

40:33.297 --> 40:34.130
- Todd, don't worry.

40:34.131 --> 40:35.216
- Can we cut that, can we cut that please.

40:35.217 --> 40:36.089
- Todd, Todd, I'll...

40:36.089 --> 40:36.922
- Get your stuff.
- Give us two seconds,

40:36.922 --> 40:37.755
please.

40:37.755 --> 40:38.590
- Who the hell are you?

40:38.590 --> 40:39.423
Can you tell me...

40:39.424 --> 40:40.528
- My name is Todd.

40:40.529 --> 40:42.138
- Are you the ring leader
of this little zoo here?

40:42.139 --> 40:43.762
- No.

40:43.763 --> 40:46.192
- Come on, let's go.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.556
Get your stuff on.

40:47.557 --> 40:48.390
- Damn.

40:48.391 --> 40:50.497
- You come up here and you
talk about being depressed,

40:50.498 --> 40:51.970
and I find you up here,

40:51.971 --> 40:54.291
in the land of
- Stop yelling.

40:54.292 --> 40:55.318
Fog and rain.

40:55.319 --> 40:56.257
- Let's just go.

40:56.258 --> 40:57.981
- And depression and suicide.

40:57.982 --> 40:59.815
We're gonna go to Dr. Wolfe,
and we're gonna get that

40:59.816 --> 41:01.820
FSH test, because you got somethin' wrong

41:01.821 --> 41:03.325
with your hormones, I swear to god.

41:03.326 --> 41:04.159
- Jesus Christ.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.317
- You don't tell anybody
what just happened,

41:05.318 --> 41:06.561
you don't tell anybody what just happened,

41:06.562 --> 41:07.395
understand me?

41:07.396 --> 41:08.763
- No nobody, just Brandon
and Marcy and that's it.

41:08.764 --> 41:10.743
- No, you don't tell
anybody, okay, nobody.

41:10.744 --> 41:12.449
- Got it, our little secret.

41:13.284 --> 41:14.619
- Jesus.

41:14.620 --> 41:17.148
- What's wrong with him?

41:17.149 --> 41:19.897
- Whoa, somebody's in a hurry.

41:19.898 --> 41:21.981
- Finally a true asshole.

41:23.311 --> 41:25.002
I love him.

41:25.003 --> 41:27.048
- My wife is a sick woman, all right.

41:27.049 --> 41:28.948
She's suffering, she's
got a lot a depression,

41:28.949 --> 41:30.988
she's got a lot a problems
going on in her life.

41:30.989 --> 41:34.763
She doesn't need some
son-of-a-bitch to come,

41:34.764 --> 41:36.620
I don't know who this guy is,

41:36.621 --> 41:38.887
to come and do something like that to her.

41:38.888 --> 41:43.055
And you tell him, that I
happen to be an attorney.

41:44.307 --> 41:45.534
I don't think he knows that.

41:45.535 --> 41:48.079
And I will sue his ass.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.327
I got credit card bills here,

41:50.328 --> 41:51.954
that read like a road map.

41:51.955 --> 41:56.602
All right, she's got pizzas
all over Spokane, Washington.

41:56.603 --> 41:59.154
Wasn't too hard to find the house.

41:59.155 --> 42:00.738
She's a sick woman.

42:01.648 --> 42:02.996
She's not in her right mind all right,

42:02.997 --> 42:04.244
she's suffering from depression.

42:04.245 --> 42:05.757
She's got all sorts a problems,

42:05.758 --> 42:09.856
and you people, you people
are accessories to this.

42:09.857 --> 42:13.974
Do you think you, look at
this, she's out of her mind.

42:13.975 --> 42:16.209
You better tell him he's
in trouble, I'm serious,

42:16.210 --> 42:18.877
I will come back for him myself.

42:20.206 --> 42:21.806
- What is going on?

42:21.807 --> 42:22.772
- What do you mean?

42:22.773 --> 42:25.064
- What's going on, where is Rebecca?

42:25.065 --> 42:27.292
- Oh she had to,
she was in a big rush,

42:27.293 --> 42:28.541
she had to go all of a sudden.

42:28.542 --> 42:30.039
She enjoyed the party though, she said,

42:30.040 --> 42:31.708
meant to say goodbye to you guys.

42:31.709 --> 42:33.809
- I don't understand what
was the speeding car,

42:33.810 --> 42:35.805
racing away, that was her?

42:35.806 --> 42:37.942
- Yeah, she called a car service.

42:37.943 --> 42:40.038
- What kinda car service
guns it like that?

42:40.039 --> 42:42.255
- One that's very speedy,

42:42.256 --> 42:44.722
one that's very into they
wanna get you there on time.

42:44.723 --> 42:47.112
- Look, look, look, she
had important business,

42:47.113 --> 42:47.946
she went to the business,

42:47.947 --> 42:49.301
that's all we have to talk about, okay,

42:49.302 --> 42:50.135
can we just...

42:50.135 --> 42:50.968
- What kinda business?

42:50.969 --> 42:52.660
- I saw her eat a whole pan a brownies.

42:52.661 --> 42:54.568
- Greg, pull over, can you pull over,

42:54.569 --> 42:55.700
there, we need more beer.

42:55.701 --> 42:56.768
- Are you upset
with me or something?

42:56.769 --> 42:57.820
- No, I'm not upset with you.

42:57.821 --> 42:58.893
- Listen, I gotta tell you,

42:58.894 --> 43:01.517
I'm not really comfortable
with this lying stuff.

43:01.518 --> 43:03.435
I don't, I feel like...

43:04.866 --> 43:07.732
- I've put you in a terrible position.

43:07.733 --> 43:10.238
I don't want you to
have to lie, all right.

43:10.239 --> 43:11.074
- So we'll just tell 'em.

43:11.075 --> 43:13.835
- No, listen to me, listen to me.

43:13.836 --> 43:15.836
You are a cool customer.

43:16.804 --> 43:19.568
The minute I met you I said,
that Greg is a cool customer.

43:19.569 --> 43:22.552
Now Brandon, he's not a cool customer.

43:22.553 --> 43:23.819
The minute he hears of trouble,

43:23.820 --> 43:25.510
he's gonna be on the
next bus back to Arizona

43:25.511 --> 43:26.344
with that camera.

43:26.345 --> 43:28.276
And Marcy cannot be trusted.

43:28.277 --> 43:32.471
You, I can trust, and
you have a cool head,

43:32.472 --> 43:34.065
so I'm going to lie for you.

43:34.066 --> 43:35.741
I'm going to take that
burden off your shoulders,

43:35.742 --> 43:38.156
and you are just gonna
have a nice van ride.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.069
It's not any trouble at all.

43:40.070 --> 43:42.252
Now, we're gonna go get a beer,

43:42.253 --> 43:43.694
and everything's gonna be fine.

43:43.695 --> 43:47.612
- Listen Todd, you know,
she's a married woman.

43:49.638 --> 43:51.231
- Are we, are we going now?

43:51.232 --> 43:53.259
- Yes, yeah, you're doin' great.

43:53.260 --> 43:54.942
- Tell me when we're ready.

43:54.943 --> 43:56.012
- We're ready.

43:56.013 --> 43:57.082
- Are we going?

43:57.083 --> 43:58.580
- Yep.

43:58.581 --> 43:59.914
- Okay, grandma.

44:02.126 --> 44:04.793
Why a,.

44:07.384 --> 44:11.301
Have you ever been really
in love with anybody?

44:12.790 --> 44:14.838
I need a little break.

44:14.839 --> 44:15.672
- What?

44:15.672 --> 44:16.505
- I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna...

44:16.505 --> 44:17.338
- You need to take a break now?

44:17.338 --> 44:18.171
- I'm gonna take a quick break,

44:18.172 --> 44:19.205
it's just a quick, I'm gonna take,

44:19.206 --> 44:20.039
I'm gonna take a quick one...

44:20.040 --> 44:21.188
- You just got back from a break.

44:21.189 --> 44:23.063
- Just a quick break
and then we're gonna be,

44:23.064 --> 44:24.393
we're off and running boy.

44:24.394 --> 44:25.398
- You just got back from a break,

44:25.399 --> 44:26.232
if you take another...

44:26.232 --> 44:27.065
- Well he needs another break.

44:27.065 --> 44:27.898
- I feel like
things are goin' good.

44:27.899 --> 44:29.008
- Well we're all set up,

44:29.009 --> 44:30.525
we can't just keep
taking breaks like this,

44:30.526 --> 44:31.898
we're not gonna get anything done.

44:31.899 --> 44:32.732
- All right, all right.

44:32.732 --> 44:33.565
- We're losing light.

44:33.566 --> 44:34.647
- Why don't we just keep, we'll just keep.

44:34.648 --> 44:36.055
You know what, he'll be back in a second,

44:36.056 --> 44:36.889
we'll just keep going.

44:36.889 --> 44:37.722
- No, we don't
have to take a break,

44:37.723 --> 44:38.790
you guys just, that's right, that's right.

44:38.791 --> 44:39.730
- Yeah, we'll keep going.

44:39.730 --> 44:40.563
- We will.

44:40.563 --> 44:41.396
- Are we going now?

44:41.397 --> 44:42.680
- No, you're doing fine.

44:42.681 --> 44:44.971
- That's what Brandon likes to
do is just shoot things when

44:44.972 --> 44:45.805
Todd's not around so...

44:45.805 --> 44:46.638
- Just go, go, go, go, go.

44:46.638 --> 44:47.471
Just get outta the shot.

44:47.471 --> 44:48.304
- Just step aside, please.

44:48.304 --> 44:49.147
- Excuse me?

44:49.148 --> 44:51.205
- Now we're starting over?

44:51.206 --> 44:52.373
- Now you were

44:55.044 --> 44:56.044
pregnant,

44:56.812 --> 44:57.812
right?

44:58.749 --> 45:02.650
- In the first chapter
of my book Truth at All Costs,

45:02.651 --> 45:07.150
I talk about truth and
its costs, all of 'em.

45:07.151 --> 45:07.984
- Hey guys.

45:07.985 --> 45:09.386
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey.

45:09.387 --> 45:10.220
- Good how are you?

45:10.220 --> 45:11.180
- Good.

45:11.181 --> 45:13.871
You should get dressed
though, 'cause it's chilly.

45:13.872 --> 45:16.431
- I'm gonna stay here a little bit.

45:16.432 --> 45:18.099
Todd's in there, and

45:20.597 --> 45:22.571
he asked that we, you guys,

45:22.572 --> 45:25.063
he needs a little time alone,

45:25.064 --> 45:27.829
because he's feeling
really creative he said,

45:27.830 --> 45:30.163
and so he needs to be alone.

45:31.173 --> 45:32.006
- Oh.

45:32.007 --> 45:36.402
- So he wanted me to ask you
guys to go and get some b-roll.

45:36.403 --> 45:38.830
If you got your stuff in the
car, you can use the camera

45:38.831 --> 45:40.030
to get some b-roll.

45:40.031 --> 45:40.864
- Okay.

45:40.865 --> 45:42.929
- For today and tomorrow.

45:42.930 --> 45:44.869
- Tomorrow, no, tomorrow we're doing...

45:44.870 --> 45:46.422
- No, no, we can't
tomorrow, definitely not.

45:46.423 --> 45:47.887
No, no, no because it's...

45:47.888 --> 45:48.721
- Grandma Shirley.

45:48.722 --> 45:49.997
- It's already set up, and they're not...

45:49.998 --> 45:51.300
- Yeah, Grandma Shirley and Pat Tonies,

45:51.301 --> 45:52.134
we're filming that tomorrow.

45:52.135 --> 45:54.540
- They're having lunch,
but that's been cancelled,

45:54.541 --> 45:57.818
so he wants you to do b-roll
for the next couple days.

45:57.819 --> 45:58.652
- Ah, really?

45:58.653 --> 46:01.934
- Couple days he wants b-roll?

46:01.935 --> 46:02.935
Okay.

46:04.585 --> 46:06.698
- Okay.

46:06.699 --> 46:08.434
- Weird that she would cancel
like that without telling us.

46:08.435 --> 46:09.268
- Cool, see ya.

46:09.268 --> 46:10.101
- Bye.

46:10.101 --> 46:11.101
- Thanks.

46:18.097 --> 46:19.430
- Oh boy.

46:23.050 --> 46:25.835
- How have things been with Todd lately?

46:25.836 --> 46:27.844
Has he been act, does he seem
like he's been okay lately?

46:27.845 --> 46:28.678
- He seems all...

46:28.679 --> 46:29.787
- I mean you know him.

46:29.788 --> 46:30.987
- He seems all right, except we don't

46:30.988 --> 46:32.035
hear from him very much.

46:32.036 --> 46:33.109
You know I don't hear from him very much.

46:33.110 --> 46:33.943
- I never hear from him.

46:33.944 --> 46:36.598
- But then on the other hand,
I don't call him either.

46:36.599 --> 46:39.596
Of course Pat hadn't seen him
for all these years but...

46:39.597 --> 46:40.548
- You remember a little boy.

46:40.549 --> 46:42.027
- Well he was sure a cute little guy,

46:42.028 --> 46:42.861
I can tell you that.

46:42.861 --> 46:43.694
- A cute little fellow.

46:43.695 --> 46:45.360
- And he had that red hair all curly,

46:45.361 --> 46:46.575
oh god he was cute.

46:46.576 --> 46:47.736
- He was really cute.

46:47.737 --> 46:48.801
- Speakin' a Curly,

46:48.802 --> 46:50.216
do you mind talkin'
about Curly a little bit,

46:50.217 --> 46:53.890
so you guys mind talking
about him a little bit for us?

46:53.891 --> 46:57.527
- Shirley was talking about
Curly in really, very...

46:57.528 --> 46:59.019
- I know, wasn't that amazing,

46:59.020 --> 47:01.528
she just really opened up about that.

47:01.529 --> 47:04.102
- I kinda think that
that's really something

47:04.103 --> 47:04.989
we should hook into.

47:04.990 --> 47:06.012
- You know, I was thinking that too,

47:06.013 --> 47:07.203
when she was talking
about it, I was thinking,

47:07.204 --> 47:10.109
I think we're really missing the boat.

47:10.110 --> 47:12.896
- So then he got his uniform,
he had his uniform on

47:12.897 --> 47:15.397
and he got ready, and he left.

47:16.377 --> 47:18.661
And then we didn't see
him of course any more.

47:18.662 --> 47:22.545
And the military police said
they found his motorcycle

47:22.546 --> 47:25.271
and they found his shoes and his watch.

47:25.272 --> 47:28.439
Where it was like his feet got caught,

47:29.519 --> 47:30.855
in one of his shoes.

47:30.856 --> 47:32.574
And so then they started
looking down there,

47:32.575 --> 47:34.549
but it got so dangerous,

47:34.550 --> 47:36.711
was so dangerous, such a surf.

47:36.712 --> 47:39.034
- I'm sort of surprised
this hasn't really been,

47:39.035 --> 47:40.957
at the forefront before, 'cause it's a...

47:40.958 --> 47:42.243
Well you know Todd's been drinking a lot.

47:42.244 --> 47:43.314
- Yeah, that's true.

47:43.315 --> 47:44.148
- So...

47:44.149 --> 47:45.906
- I thought it would kinda
loosen him up a little bit.

47:45.907 --> 47:49.807
Really made him super-loose,
to being incoherent.

47:49.808 --> 47:51.843
- You know it's been a couple
days, Todd's been a little

47:51.844 --> 47:55.386
depressed I think, safe to
say, so we're thinking it out,

47:55.387 --> 47:56.615
figurin' out what we're gonna do.

47:56.616 --> 47:58.025
If we need to get some more money,

47:58.026 --> 47:59.404
we'll do whatever it takes.

47:59.405 --> 48:01.523
- We don't exactly know
where, well Rebecca is?

48:01.524 --> 48:03.809
- She is scouting...

48:03.810 --> 48:06.176
- Location scouting in Spokane.

48:06.177 --> 48:09.495
- For three days, which is a little weird.

48:09.496 --> 48:10.496
- Yes.

48:11.462 --> 48:13.075
- We're not gonna let
the other guys know that

48:13.076 --> 48:13.945
Rebecca's gone for now,

48:13.946 --> 48:16.564
so we told her that she's
off location scouting,

48:16.565 --> 48:19.236
which I think they're totally buying that.

48:19.237 --> 48:20.906
- I've found that when
we go on certain blocks,

48:20.907 --> 48:22.308
I feel like I've been there already,

48:22.309 --> 48:23.234
even though they're different blocks.

48:23.235 --> 48:27.153
So maybe she's having the same problem.

48:27.154 --> 48:28.400
- So yeah, we're keepin' them busy,

48:28.401 --> 48:30.195
they're off doin' some b-roll for us now.

48:30.196 --> 48:32.212
Some stuff we probably
won't even end up using

48:32.213 --> 48:34.805
or anything, but, we just
wanna keep 'em occupied,

48:34.806 --> 48:39.202
so that we can figure out
what the next thing to do is.

48:39.203 --> 48:42.120
If I have to get some kind of a job

48:43.344 --> 48:44.695
or something to raise a little more money,

48:44.696 --> 48:47.326
I'm happy to do that because I've really,

48:47.327 --> 48:50.314
I think I've really found
my calling with sound.

48:50.315 --> 48:51.558
Sound.

48:51.559 --> 48:55.650
And I don't wanna go back to
Arizona at this point, no.

48:55.651 --> 48:57.518
- In a way it's good she's gone, for now.

48:57.519 --> 49:00.602
- Yeah, she'd be good to have around,

49:02.160 --> 49:02.993
ultimately.

49:02.993 --> 49:03.826
- She'd be good to have around ultimately.

49:03.827 --> 49:05.286
I don't know that we
necessarily need her there

49:05.287 --> 49:07.040
all the time on the set.

49:07.041 --> 49:09.938
I think it's, she could do
what she's doing away from

49:09.939 --> 49:11.022
where we are.

49:12.756 --> 49:15.386
- They just interviewed
my grandma and Pat Tonies.

49:15.387 --> 49:17.470
- That's your job.

49:19.636 --> 49:21.733
- I think he's gonna be really
pleased with the footage.

49:21.734 --> 49:23.463
- Yeah, we make a pretty
good team, actually.

49:23.464 --> 49:24.797
- I think we do.

49:29.329 --> 49:31.912
- They're suppose to do b-roll.

49:33.214 --> 49:35.815
- We'll get him back,
we'll get him back, he's,

49:35.816 --> 49:37.585
you need time to blow off steam, I guess.

49:37.586 --> 49:39.718
- But if we
don't, we don't need him.

49:39.719 --> 49:41.584
- I guess you're right.

49:41.585 --> 49:44.600
- I mean, I think we've
proved that today, so.

49:44.601 --> 49:47.870
- True enough, can't argue with that.

49:54.752 --> 49:57.274
- Todd, I want you to know
that I don't want you to feel

49:57.275 --> 50:00.835
badly anymore about that old fish.

50:00.836 --> 50:02.593
She's no good anymore,

50:02.594 --> 50:05.314
but go out and get a new fish.

50:05.315 --> 50:07.871
And get a new pool,
and use some good bait,

50:07.872 --> 50:09.314
you know how to do that.

50:09.315 --> 50:11.732
And throw that old fish away.

50:13.489 --> 50:15.906
Don't think about it anymore,

50:17.818 --> 50:18.818
there.

50:21.354 --> 50:22.581
Are you okay?

50:22.582 --> 50:23.415
- I'm fine.

50:23.415 --> 50:24.248
- Do you feel better now?

50:24.248 --> 50:25.081
- I'm good, thank you.

50:25.081 --> 50:26.081
- Okay.

50:26.865 --> 50:27.865
Ohhhh,

50:30.243 --> 50:31.243
no.

50:32.893 --> 50:34.825
- So you got this all taken care of here.

50:34.826 --> 50:36.279
- I'm not saying
anything, I'm just saying.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.511
- Got it all set, Franz, mic'd up.

50:37.512 --> 50:38.783
- Take a look in the refrigerator,

50:38.784 --> 50:40.143
I mean how many six packs of beer...

50:40.144 --> 50:41.091
- I'm gonna go talk to the guys,

50:41.091 --> 50:41.924
tell 'em to keep it down.

50:41.924 --> 50:42.757
- I heard he just needs to...

50:42.757 --> 50:43.665
- Hey guys, we need to keep it down

50:43.666 --> 50:45.278
just a little bit 'cause
he's doing his OTF.

50:45.279 --> 50:46.112
- Oh, okay.

50:46.112 --> 50:47.034
- Yeah we're really screamin'
- And actually,

50:47.035 --> 50:48.483
this could be, I'm sorry.

50:48.484 --> 50:49.317
- What?

50:49.318 --> 50:50.903
- This could be probably a good time,

50:50.904 --> 50:53.751
if we could just keep our voices down,

50:53.752 --> 50:56.391
for me to talk to you about something.

50:56.392 --> 50:58.736
I know Todd's been really upset,

50:58.737 --> 51:02.017
and you've really hurt him a lot.

51:02.018 --> 51:03.490
- How have we hurt Todd?

51:03.491 --> 51:05.042
- Well let's see if we can guess.

51:05.043 --> 51:07.682
Would it have anything to do with b-roll?

51:07.683 --> 51:08.516
Yeah.

51:08.516 --> 51:09.349
- You know what, you know what...

51:09.349 --> 51:10.182
- We sent you for b-roll,

51:10.183 --> 51:11.982
and I would call what you did a-roll.

51:11.983 --> 51:13.327
You know we got a call
from his grandmother,

51:13.328 --> 51:15.423
and we know you've been
doing important interviews.

51:15.424 --> 51:16.358
- Can I just ask you a quick question,

51:16.359 --> 51:17.907
did you look at the footage?

51:17.908 --> 51:19.199
- I've seen the footage
that Todd's been doing

51:19.200 --> 51:20.033
which is quite beautiful.

51:20.033 --> 51:20.866
- Did you look at the footage?
- You know what

51:20.867 --> 51:22.069
happens, what happens
- Did you look at

51:22.070 --> 51:22.903
the footage?

51:22.903 --> 51:23.861
- Professionals do their job.

51:23.862 --> 51:27.044
When people get erratic and do
booze and drink and go crazy,

51:27.045 --> 51:28.378
other people have to step in.

51:28.379 --> 51:29.636
It's a team effort, Greg.

51:29.637 --> 51:30.605
- You make a good point,

51:30.606 --> 51:32.352
professionals do their job
- If you understood

51:32.353 --> 51:33.186
what a team was, that's right.

51:33.186 --> 51:34.019
- And your job was b-roll.

51:34.020 --> 51:35.079
- The thing is that Todd,
- We stepped up for

51:35.080 --> 51:36.167
someone who didn't...
- Hello.

51:36.168 --> 51:38.335
Todd is in the kitchen and

51:40.468 --> 51:41.484
we love him, but...

51:41.485 --> 51:42.607
- How's your...

51:42.608 --> 51:45.941
- So this asshole Brandon has found this

51:46.975 --> 51:48.800
horny troll,

51:48.801 --> 51:49.801
Marcy.

51:50.576 --> 51:53.032
Two retarded people.

51:53.033 --> 51:56.272
- You are, for all intents and purposes,

51:56.273 --> 51:59.252
the director of this documentary.

51:59.253 --> 52:00.086
- What do you mean?

52:00.087 --> 52:03.019
- And you are a producer, you
have a great sense of story,

52:03.020 --> 52:04.189
and I want you to follow that.

52:04.190 --> 52:06.892
- What a second, all intents
and purpose, or I am?

52:06.893 --> 52:08.087
- Well, ah, well...

52:08.088 --> 52:09.057
- Are we just,
- I don't want a

52:09.057 --> 52:09.890
qualification,
- are we changing the?

52:09.890 --> 52:10.723
- Am I the director?

52:10.723 --> 52:11.556
- No, I mean, I'm still the director...

52:11.556 --> 52:12.389
- Are you drunk?

52:12.390 --> 52:14.174
- But you are the highest of
- We're not gonna

52:14.175 --> 52:15.237
talk about his drinking
- Second in command.

52:15.238 --> 52:16.428
- Problem, I mean I'm sorry.

52:16.429 --> 52:17.262
- Really.

52:17.262 --> 52:18.095
- Who is this guy?

52:18.096 --> 52:19.252
- Okay, you're the director,
you're the director,

52:19.253 --> 52:20.129
I have bigger things.

52:20.130 --> 52:23.191
I have big contracts to
deal with, I can't...

52:23.192 --> 52:24.418
- All right, so
you're giving me the reins.

52:24.419 --> 52:25.253
- I don't understand
what's goin' on with him.

52:25.254 --> 52:26.686
- Yes, I'm giving you the reins.

52:26.687 --> 52:28.670
- All right, before we go any further,

52:28.671 --> 52:30.175
can we just ask you something now?

52:30.176 --> 52:31.009
'Cause you looked at the footage,

52:31.010 --> 52:32.388
and I know that I'm the stupid one,

52:32.389 --> 52:33.850
and I'm the naive one,
and I don't know anything

52:33.851 --> 52:34.744
about filmmaking and everything,

52:34.745 --> 52:37.410
but I'm getting the
feeling the Curly story

52:37.411 --> 52:39.534
is maybe the thing that we should follow?

52:39.535 --> 52:43.118
- Can two retarded make
a genius filmmaker?

52:44.355 --> 52:45.605
Positively yes.

52:46.974 --> 52:50.329
My mother was a retard,
my father was a retard,

52:50.330 --> 52:51.497
and here I am,

52:52.633 --> 52:53.996
genius.

52:53.997 --> 52:57.179
- You have to tell people
what they wanna hear.

52:57.180 --> 52:59.777
You're the most important
person, as far as I'm concerned,

52:59.778 --> 53:01.123
on this production.

53:01.124 --> 53:05.676
Now I need you to go
out and shake the trees,

53:05.677 --> 53:09.090
and find more funding for this movie.

53:09.091 --> 53:10.868
Do you understand?

53:10.869 --> 53:12.194
- Trees?

53:12.195 --> 53:14.008
- Do you have any saucers
for this gentleman today?

53:14.009 --> 53:16.019
- We don't have saucers,
you'll remember that

53:16.020 --> 53:16.857
from your training.

53:16.857 --> 53:17.690
Cups, no saucers.
- There you go,

53:17.690 --> 53:18.523
thank you so much, and that's...

53:18.523 --> 53:19.523
- How much?

53:20.362 --> 53:23.222
- That's, double would be I think that's,

53:23.223 --> 53:25.640
so let's go 3.95 on that one.

53:27.116 --> 53:28.897
- This isn't a garage sale,

53:28.898 --> 53:30.409
the prices are pretty firm.

53:30.410 --> 53:34.296
- Jody, I did it again,
I cleared out the money.

53:34.297 --> 53:35.130
- Do you know how long it takes me

53:35.131 --> 53:36.425
to void out this register?

53:39.015 --> 53:41.232
- Mike Benevento.

53:41.233 --> 53:42.233
Hello.

53:51.598 --> 53:53.423
- I am begging you, will
you please just order

53:53.424 --> 53:55.137
just a regular coffee?

53:55.138 --> 53:57.515
Something, just a regular coffee.

53:57.516 --> 53:59.454
Decaff's fine.

53:59.455 --> 54:02.221
- You're not very bright, are you?

54:03.234 --> 54:06.522
- Ah, fuck, ah, shit, oh god.

54:06.523 --> 54:09.370
- Remember the acronym, it's H, hot,

54:09.371 --> 54:10.436
you should remember that.

54:10.437 --> 54:11.720
- Yes.

54:11.721 --> 54:12.852
- You think I
don't know who this is?

54:12.853 --> 54:14.515
You are a dead man.

54:14.516 --> 54:17.198
- Apparently, see I didn't know this part

54:17.199 --> 54:18.568
until after the fact.

54:18.569 --> 54:22.452
But apparently he got a
phone call from his commander

54:22.453 --> 54:25.484
and his commander wanted
to see him at the base.

54:25.485 --> 54:27.686
I guess it made him really nervous,

54:27.687 --> 54:30.958
but he told us girls that
he was gonna go play golf,

54:30.959 --> 54:32.369
and he left.

54:32.370 --> 54:34.936
But he left without his golf
clubs, which is strange.

54:34.937 --> 54:36.697
The next thing I know,
he didn't come home,

54:36.698 --> 54:37.966
it was night time.

54:37.967 --> 54:39.371
He didn't come home and the MPS,

54:39.372 --> 54:42.190
or whatever you call the air police,

54:42.191 --> 54:46.358
came to the house and told
my mom that they had found

54:47.513 --> 54:51.177
his moped, and some
stuff out at the cliff,

54:51.178 --> 54:54.546
on the golf course where he had gone.

54:54.547 --> 54:56.048
And they couldn't find him though.

54:56.049 --> 54:57.676
And they never found his body.

54:57.677 --> 55:01.235
They just found evidence, like
they found a shoe I think.

55:01.236 --> 55:05.307
Maybe his wallet, and his
watch hangin' on the cliffs.

55:05.308 --> 55:08.068
But the death certificate
said fell, jumped or pushed

55:08.069 --> 55:10.053
'cause they couldn't prove anything.

55:10.054 --> 55:14.221
And for us girls, it was
better if he didn't jump.

55:18.344 --> 55:19.594
- Hello.

55:20.894 --> 55:22.019
Shithead.

55:22.020 --> 55:26.356
- I was about 33 years
old, my uncle told me,

55:26.357 --> 55:29.341
that one of his men, 'cause my
uncle's in the air force too,

55:29.342 --> 55:32.730
had seen my dad either in
Africa or Asia or somewhere.

55:32.731 --> 55:35.084
I don't know where, I forget.

55:35.085 --> 55:36.581
And he called my dad's name,

55:36.582 --> 55:39.000
and whoever this guy was turned around,

55:39.001 --> 55:41.107
saw this Air Force man,

55:41.108 --> 55:43.970
turned around and started running.

55:46.881 --> 55:48.116
- Hello.

55:48.117 --> 55:49.117
- Hi.

55:53.417 --> 55:54.983
- Todd.

55:54.984 --> 55:55.984
Rebecca.

55:57.258 --> 55:58.354
- Wow.

55:58.355 --> 55:59.188
- Okay.

55:59.189 --> 56:00.537
- I thought she'd fallen
off the face of the earth.

56:00.538 --> 56:02.909
- She's been lookin' for
locations I guess, right?

56:02.910 --> 56:03.743
- For a week.

56:03.744 --> 56:05.037
- Hey, hi.

56:05.038 --> 56:07.505
- Good seeing you stranger.

56:07.506 --> 56:09.392
- Where have you been for week, Rebecca?

56:09.393 --> 56:11.908
- Now listen, I wanted to talk about that.

56:11.909 --> 56:14.789
Because the thing is, is those
contracts I told you about,

56:14.790 --> 56:16.658
heavy negotiations.

56:16.659 --> 56:20.887
It's a strange thing, and
it has to do with contracts.

56:20.888 --> 56:23.657
But I think we should not talk about...

56:23.658 --> 56:24.491
- Oh come on.

56:24.492 --> 56:26.780
- Oh we cannot, we cannot, we cannot.

56:26.781 --> 56:28.897
- We haven't seen her in a week.

56:28.898 --> 56:30.244
- I just say something to you guys,

56:30.245 --> 56:32.608
I am so sorry, I am so sorry...

56:32.609 --> 56:33.442
- For what?

56:33.442 --> 56:34.275
- And I want you know...

56:34.275 --> 56:35.108
- why are you sorry?

56:35.109 --> 56:38.280
- That from now on, it's all cash.

56:38.281 --> 56:39.369
- I did come back with cash,

56:39.370 --> 56:42.355
I just feel like, what's better than cash?

56:42.356 --> 56:44.544
- The main thing is, is
that A Journey to Courage

56:44.545 --> 56:47.137
is in good standing,
the team is assembled,

56:47.138 --> 56:48.006
and we're going forward.

56:48.007 --> 56:50.364
- Wait, but when you say
A Journey to Courage,

56:50.365 --> 56:53.088
you mean the Curly story, right?

56:53.089 --> 56:54.455
That's what we agreed that we were

56:54.456 --> 56:55.289
gonna be working on now...

56:55.290 --> 56:58.205
- We agreed that you were
going to explore that,

56:58.206 --> 57:00.326
but I think that that exploration is over,

57:00.327 --> 57:03.982
and I think now we're gonna go
on with A Journey to Courage.

57:03.983 --> 57:05.941
Because I'm going to tell
the story of the women

57:05.942 --> 57:08.345
in my family, and that's
what we talked about.

57:08.346 --> 57:09.886
- I'd kind of rather not talk about this.

57:09.887 --> 57:13.390
I don't know if that's okay, I just,

57:13.391 --> 57:17.012
I mean my husband's home,
and Grace is with my sister,

57:17.013 --> 57:19.706
and that was a difficult situation,

57:19.707 --> 57:21.211
but I felt like I really needed to

57:21.212 --> 57:23.537
come back and finish Todd.

57:23.538 --> 57:25.118
- I think perhaps it might be a good idea

57:25.119 --> 57:27.721
for us to take a little road trip.

57:27.722 --> 57:28.623
- What, for like to relax?

57:28.624 --> 57:29.873
- To San Diego.

57:30.739 --> 57:31.572
- Why?

57:31.573 --> 57:32.822
- To San Diego,

57:34.047 --> 57:36.607
to reenact Curly's disappearance.

57:36.608 --> 57:38.506
- Oh, that is a great idea.

57:38.507 --> 57:39.811
- I think that's a crazy tangent.

57:39.812 --> 57:42.060
- No, no, no, no, it's
a great idea, listen.

57:42.061 --> 57:44.623
If we cut it together with
the stuff that Brandon

57:44.624 --> 57:48.278
and I shot, the interviews,
it would be like this

57:48.279 --> 57:50.007
beautiful rich tapestry, that we could...

57:50.008 --> 57:50.841
- It'll fill it out.

57:50.842 --> 57:51.958
- It would be gorgeous, and it would be...

57:51.959 --> 57:52.808
- No, no.

57:52.809 --> 57:54.910
- Listen, even if we go
- We can afford it.

57:54.911 --> 57:57.156
With the journey to courage angle...

57:57.157 --> 57:57.990
- Even if we go with the

57:57.990 --> 57:58.823
journey to courage...
- If that really is

57:58.823 --> 57:59.656
full of cash.

57:59.656 --> 58:00.489
- All right, listen.

58:00.490 --> 58:03.562
It'll be, just add this depth to it.

58:03.563 --> 58:05.625
- I think it's a good idea.

58:05.626 --> 58:07.466
- I've always wanted
to go to San Diego myself.

58:09.591 --> 58:12.110
- They're off to San Diego.

58:12.111 --> 58:14.361
And I'm off to the crapper.

58:24.030 --> 58:25.940
- It is so great to be in San Diego.

58:25.941 --> 58:27.285
I am so excited to be here.

58:27.286 --> 58:29.453
Oh my gosh, I'm so jazzed.

58:32.092 --> 58:34.123
It's not like any place
I've ever been before.

58:34.124 --> 58:35.737
I mean I've never really
been any place but Spokane,

58:35.738 --> 58:37.639
but it's totally not like Spokane.

58:37.640 --> 58:38.473
It's a little hot though.

58:38.474 --> 58:40.539
I'm a few little heat rash issues,

58:40.540 --> 58:42.222
but other than that, it's great.

58:42.223 --> 58:46.741
- Rebecca's back and she
brings a light with her,

58:46.742 --> 58:49.382
whereas Todd sort of there's a darkness,

58:49.383 --> 58:52.968
kind of a cloud that he brings so,

58:52.969 --> 58:56.703
I guess the net gains
gonna be sort of a gray.

58:56.704 --> 58:58.318
- I don't know what happened with Rebecca.

58:58.319 --> 59:00.525
All that stuff was really weird,

59:00.526 --> 59:02.618
like we have funding,
we don't have funding,

59:02.619 --> 59:04.336
we have a bag of cash.

59:04.337 --> 59:05.587
- I switched to

59:06.709 --> 59:08.792
cash because it's easier.

59:10.253 --> 59:13.586
Just to, it's just simpler to deal with.

59:15.879 --> 59:17.569
- Marcy put an ad in for the Pennysaver,

59:17.570 --> 59:18.561
so I checked out the house

59:18.562 --> 59:20.527
we're gonna do the reenactments in,

59:20.528 --> 59:24.854
and this woman Janice is really wonderful.

59:24.855 --> 59:28.272
She's very specific about what she wants.

59:29.327 --> 59:32.902
I couldn't sit in particular chairs.

59:32.903 --> 59:34.905
Actually, I didn't sit down at all.

59:44.626 --> 59:46.122
- I am so sorry that
this is taking longer...

59:46.123 --> 59:47.671
- Well what is the problem?

59:47.672 --> 59:48.505
- Well, what we're doing is,

59:48.506 --> 59:50.550
we're ready to go, we're just waiting for

59:50.551 --> 59:53.630
one other person to show up
who's playing the grandfather

59:53.631 --> 59:54.751
in the reenactment, and the girls...

59:54.752 --> 59:56.668
- Well I didn't realize
it'd be so long before

59:56.669 --> 59:59.394
you even got anything started at all.

59:59.395 --> 01:00:00.469
- Oh, we'll just make sure...

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:02.552
- Pardon me, young lady,

01:00:02.553 --> 01:00:03.714
please don't touch that.

01:00:03.715 --> 01:00:04.925
- Yeah, oh, please
don't touch anything.

01:00:04.926 --> 01:00:06.591
- That's from my family ancestors

01:00:06.592 --> 01:00:09.640
in Sweden, and it's about 300 years old.

01:00:09.641 --> 01:00:10.695
- Oh it's beautiful though,

01:00:10.696 --> 01:00:11.529
- I would just die

01:00:11.529 --> 01:00:12.449
if anything happened to it.

01:00:12.449 --> 01:00:13.378
- Isn't that just beautiful, yeah.

01:00:13.379 --> 01:00:15.062
- I need a cigarette,
do you have a cigarette?

01:00:15.063 --> 01:00:15.896
- You're going to smoke,

01:00:15.897 --> 01:00:17.016
but you're going to smoke outside, right?

01:00:17.017 --> 01:00:18.039
- Yes mam, we'll take it outside.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:18.873
- Thank you.

01:00:18.873 --> 01:00:19.706
- This is her house,

01:00:19.707 --> 01:00:21.335
we should respect exactly
what she wants and just do...

01:00:21.336 --> 01:00:22.354
- We're gonna have to move things.

01:00:22.355 --> 01:00:24.586
It doesn't look like the
50s or 60s or whatever.

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:25.420
- We'll be fine.

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:28.477
- She's not, she told me not
to look at certain paintings.

01:00:28.478 --> 01:00:29.453
- Well did you look at 'em?

01:00:29.454 --> 01:00:30.695
- I don't know which ones not to look at.

01:00:30.696 --> 01:00:31.835
- Just don't look at any of them.

01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:33.041
- Please be
careful of the door there.

01:00:33.042 --> 01:00:33.875
- Yes, yes, she's
closing it right now.

01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:34.708
- Be sure you shut the door

01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:35.541
- and we've got the shoes off.

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:36.374
- Because I have a dog

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:37.620
somewhere in the house.

01:00:37.621 --> 01:00:38.454
- And they should be here.

01:00:38.454 --> 01:00:39.287
- Ah, finally, thank you.

01:00:39.288 --> 01:00:41.939
- Oh is this Todd?

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.462
- We've been waiting
a half hour to go, let's go.

01:00:44.463 --> 01:00:46.184
- We got the most amazing doughnuts.

01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:47.018
- I got doughnuts.

01:00:47.019 --> 01:00:48.284
- We don't want doughnuts.

01:00:48.285 --> 01:00:49.786
- What we need is to get going.

01:00:49.787 --> 01:00:51.919
Can we start, we lose the
girls in less than an hour.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.947
- All right, so let's get
started, let's get started.

01:00:54.948 --> 01:00:56.898
- Has anybody seen the dog?

01:00:56.899 --> 01:00:58.350
Did anybody see a dog go out?

01:00:58.351 --> 01:00:59.416
A little pug dog?

01:00:59.417 --> 01:01:00.449
- No, I don't
think the dog has been...

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:01.771
- Actually I
did see a little dog.

01:01:01.772 --> 01:01:02.785
- Mugsy, little Grey dog
- I'm pretty sure

01:01:02.786 --> 01:01:03.783
- with a red collar.
- She's still inside,

01:01:03.783 --> 01:01:04.665
I saw her.

01:01:04.666 --> 01:01:05.811
- I think it might have been.

01:01:05.812 --> 01:01:07.564
- And the gate, somebody
left the gate open too.

01:01:07.565 --> 01:01:10.049
That means the dog could
get right out on the street,

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:10.883
for heaven's sake.

01:01:10.884 --> 01:01:14.504
Oh please, will everybody
go out and look for the dog.

01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:15.652
- Mugsy.

01:01:15.653 --> 01:01:16.486
- Mugs.

01:01:16.487 --> 01:01:17.819
- Mugsy.

01:01:18.722 --> 01:01:19.582
- Mugsy.

01:01:19.583 --> 01:01:22.181
- You know I'm really
annoyed with Todd about this.

01:01:22.182 --> 01:01:23.499
- Yeah, well you and me both.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.003
- Actually I'm really annoyed with Rebecca

01:01:25.004 --> 01:01:25.837
is who I'm annoyed with.

01:01:25.838 --> 01:01:27.562
- Why are you annoyed with Rebecca?

01:01:27.563 --> 01:01:29.369
- I don't know, it just seems
like ever since she's been

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:31.432
back Todd has been weird
and unfocused and like...

01:01:31.433 --> 01:01:32.266
- It's nothing to do with
her, it has to do with Todd.

01:01:32.267 --> 01:01:33.973
- He has a look on his face, goofy.

01:01:33.974 --> 01:01:34.807
- She's fine,

01:01:34.808 --> 01:01:36.965
it's Todd who's bringin'
in all this weird stuff.

01:01:36.966 --> 01:01:38.163
- I don't know, I think
it's her, because...

01:01:38.164 --> 01:01:40.207
- She's the only reason we're here.

01:01:40.208 --> 01:01:41.502
She's the only reason we're
getting anything done.

01:01:41.503 --> 01:01:42.768
- I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

01:01:42.769 --> 01:01:44.800
She's very nice, she's very nice.

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:47.431
- You don't have to patronize.

01:01:47.432 --> 01:01:48.482
I'm gonna go look for...

01:01:48.483 --> 01:01:50.566
- Well you don't have to get mad about it.

01:01:50.567 --> 01:01:53.349
God, why are you getting so mad?

01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:56.166
We could still look together.

01:01:56.167 --> 01:01:57.167
Mugsy.

01:01:59.226 --> 01:02:00.226
Mugsy

01:02:02.083 --> 01:02:02.916
- It's so nice here.

01:02:02.917 --> 01:02:05.121
- We found all these, we
found a great coffee shop

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:07.540
and this little place where
they have danish, and...

01:02:07.541 --> 01:02:10.624
- Did you have one of those danishes?

01:02:14.135 --> 01:02:15.772
- Hey guys there's a shitload here.

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:20.367
I don't know how I got it, but
you're welcome to have some.

01:02:20.368 --> 01:02:21.368
Mugsy.

01:02:26.551 --> 01:02:27.551
Seriously.

01:02:30.606 --> 01:02:32.356
I hate raisin danish.

01:02:33.325 --> 01:02:34.826
- Mugsy.

01:02:34.827 --> 01:02:39.097
- It got really sort of intense,
and difficult for awhile.

01:02:39.098 --> 01:02:42.636
But I really, I feel like
we've turned a corner.

01:02:42.637 --> 01:02:43.470
- I do too.

01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:46.396
- I feel like we're
just gonna move forward,

01:02:46.397 --> 01:02:50.750
I don't feel like
anything can stop us now.

01:02:50.751 --> 01:02:53.041
- What is your problem?

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:56.799
- Drinkin' beers with
my wife in some hotel room.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.020
- I'm so sick of
you bullyin' everyone around.

01:02:58.021 --> 01:02:58.854
- What you trying
to do anything about?

01:02:58.855 --> 01:03:00.777
- Come on, go away, stop.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:01.907
- What is your problem?

01:03:01.908 --> 01:03:03.282
- Are you drinkin'
beers with my wife?

01:03:03.283 --> 01:03:05.390
- Stop bullying everyone, shut up.

01:03:05.391 --> 01:03:06.224
- Who the hell are you?

01:03:06.224 --> 01:03:07.057
- And get out of here.

01:03:07.057 --> 01:03:07.890
Leave him alone.

01:03:07.891 --> 01:03:08.908
- Consider yourself served wife thief.

01:03:08.909 --> 01:03:09.742
- Leave him alone, get out of here.

01:03:09.743 --> 01:03:11.439
- What is going on?

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.273
- What is going on?

01:03:12.273 --> 01:03:13.106
- Leave me alone.
- Had a gun, and he was

01:03:13.107 --> 01:03:14.585
pissed off.

01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:16.847
- Why do I keep finding
you with this loser?

01:03:16.848 --> 01:03:18.368
- Why are you always so violent?

01:03:18.369 --> 01:03:19.202
I hate you.

01:03:19.202 --> 01:03:20.035
- Is it so that you hate?

01:03:20.036 --> 01:03:21.557
- You are ruining my life, leave me alone.

01:03:21.558 --> 01:03:23.808
- We have a great marriage.

01:03:41.497 --> 01:03:43.497
- That was really weird.

01:03:44.994 --> 01:03:47.787
I think we'll be all right though, man.

01:03:47.788 --> 01:03:50.631
- Oh, I'm never gonna lose these hiccups.

01:03:50.632 --> 01:03:53.756
- I don't know what else to try Greg.

01:03:53.757 --> 01:03:55.178
I tried scaring you.

01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:58.122
- Ah, please don't do that.

01:03:58.123 --> 01:04:01.118
That's what started it when
he came in with that gun.

01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:02.555
- He didn't have a gun, by the way.

01:04:02.556 --> 01:04:05.714
- He had a gun, I saw
it in his back pocket.

01:04:05.715 --> 01:04:08.414
- Listen, I'm Marcy by the way.

01:04:08.415 --> 01:04:09.832
What's your name?

01:04:12.053 --> 01:04:13.527
- Mike Benevento.
- Hi Mike.

01:04:13.528 --> 01:04:14.361
- He's a big dude.

01:04:14.362 --> 01:04:16.252
- It was fuckin' violent is what it was.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:19.085
I am not, I do not come
from a family that hits.

01:04:19.086 --> 01:04:21.051
I do not come from that kind of family.

01:04:21.052 --> 01:04:21.885
- Me neither.

01:04:21.885 --> 01:04:22.718
- A lot of people do.

01:04:22.718 --> 01:04:23.551
I do not.

01:04:23.552 --> 01:04:24.840
My mother never hit my father.

01:04:24.841 --> 01:04:27.103
- Hey Mike, Mike, Mike.

01:04:27.104 --> 01:04:30.017
Why don't you let everything
cool down just a little bit.

01:04:30.018 --> 01:04:31.229
Just everything needs to cool down.

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:32.797
She needs to cool down,
you need to think about

01:04:32.798 --> 01:04:36.721
what you're doin' here
instead of hittin' people.

01:04:36.722 --> 01:04:39.722
- It was scary, I was really scared.

01:04:40.615 --> 01:04:42.525
- Did you try to defend Rebecca at least?

01:04:42.526 --> 01:04:44.854
- I hit the dirt, and then...

01:04:44.855 --> 01:04:46.105
- You didn't hit the
dirt, you hit the fence.

01:04:46.106 --> 01:04:47.589
Is there dirt on the fence?

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:49.019
- Rust.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.263
- Work on this thing with us.

01:04:51.264 --> 01:04:52.804
You've already put money into it.

01:04:52.805 --> 01:04:54.960
Do you wanna walk away
now and it's just like a

01:04:54.961 --> 01:04:56.731
half-baked piece of poop,

01:04:56.732 --> 01:04:58.531
or do you wanna follow it through

01:04:58.532 --> 01:04:59.821
and see if we can make it into something

01:04:59.822 --> 01:05:01.560
and get your money back?

01:05:02.395 --> 01:05:03.644
- Dude, please.

01:05:05.332 --> 01:05:06.769
- Fine, if she wants to make a movie,

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:07.987
I can make a movie with her.

01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:09.824
I can certainly make a
better movie than that

01:05:09.825 --> 01:05:11.874
little pasty face that
she's with right now,

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:12.853
I'll tell you that much.

01:05:12.854 --> 01:05:16.017
- Well, we could all work together on it.

01:05:16.018 --> 01:05:17.185
I mean we're already here, we're...

01:05:17.186 --> 01:05:20.299
- I haven't, you know what, the movie bi,

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.676
what's the big deal?

01:05:21.677 --> 01:05:23.014
I'm a people person.

01:05:23.015 --> 01:05:23.848
- Right, I can tell.

01:05:23.848 --> 01:05:24.848
- Right?

01:05:37.866 --> 01:05:39.359
Honey, I've been up all night,

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.832
I do not know what to
say other than I'm just,

01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:43.916
I'm really, really sorry.

01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:47.935
I just...

01:05:47.936 --> 01:05:49.834
- I know, I know, I'm sorry too.

01:05:49.835 --> 01:05:50.800
You're always sorry, it's just...

01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:53.345
- I know, I see how important,
all I have to say is

01:05:53.346 --> 01:05:54.179
I see how important...

01:05:54.179 --> 01:05:55.168
- I know that, I see your
side, I don't wanna talk.

01:05:55.169 --> 01:05:57.958
- Can I just say something to you?

01:05:59.403 --> 01:06:02.570
- Meeting at the pool in five minutes.

01:06:06.475 --> 01:06:09.244
Meeting at the pool in five minutes.

01:06:09.245 --> 01:06:10.247
- What is this,
what are you talking about?

01:06:10.248 --> 01:06:11.081
- What's Todd doing?

01:06:11.082 --> 01:06:13.061
- What I'm talking about is,

01:06:13.062 --> 01:06:16.345
there is a new sheriff in town.

01:06:16.346 --> 01:06:19.601
Okay, consider the fact
that I own this picture.

01:06:19.602 --> 01:06:23.111
Mrs. Mike Benevento took a pile of cash

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:25.002
out of Mr. Mike Benevento's account.

01:06:25.003 --> 01:06:26.460
- Well take that up
with Todd, I'm not involved,

01:06:26.461 --> 01:06:27.620
I'm just the camera guy.

01:06:27.621 --> 01:06:29.700
- You signed a contract,

01:06:29.701 --> 01:06:32.599
signed on with Mrs. Mike
Benevento as producer.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.516
In my corporation she's
a principal officer,

01:06:34.517 --> 01:06:36.671
that makes me the person
who really controls,

01:06:36.672 --> 01:06:39.081
and owns, the first part of the picture.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:40.901
I tried to do this the nice way.

01:06:40.902 --> 01:06:43.150
I tried to hand you an olive branch

01:06:43.151 --> 01:06:45.584
and you did not accept it,
so we're gonna do it my way.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:46.729
Okay?

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:48.815
If you ever hope to get a movie done,

01:06:48.816 --> 01:06:51.078
we're going to do it under my terms.

01:06:51.079 --> 01:06:52.669
- Well and if I
just take my camera and go,

01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:53.503
what are you gonna do?

01:06:53.504 --> 01:06:54.981
- Fine, you can take your camera and go.

01:06:54.982 --> 01:06:57.655
And I will hound you
every foot of the way.

01:06:57.656 --> 01:06:58.489
- I'm not gonna do the picture

01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:59.848
if Todd isn't a part of it.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.431
- You are free to go.

01:07:01.432 --> 01:07:02.265
- There's nothing you can do to me,

01:07:02.266 --> 01:07:03.649
I don't have a job, you can't take a lien.

01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:05.808
- What is it you do again?

01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:06.642
- Sound.

01:07:06.642 --> 01:07:07.475
- Sound.

01:07:07.476 --> 01:07:09.473
The, you hold the...

01:07:09.474 --> 01:07:10.726
- It's a little more
complicated than that, sir.

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:12.810
- Oh it is, hey sir, sir,

01:07:13.881 --> 01:07:15.049
- Excuse me?

01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:16.063
I'm sorry, I got a question for you.

01:07:16.064 --> 01:07:17.781
Do you think you can hold the pole

01:07:17.782 --> 01:07:19.979
and kinda move it a little bit.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:20.813
- Sure.

01:07:20.814 --> 01:07:22.664
- Okay, you're hired.

01:07:22.665 --> 01:07:24.184
We've got our sound guy.

01:07:24.185 --> 01:07:27.720
- Actually Mr. Benevento you
make an interesting point.

01:07:27.721 --> 01:07:30.197
I'd like to ask if could
stay for a little bit.

01:07:30.198 --> 01:07:31.474
- Good, welcome back.

01:07:31.475 --> 01:07:32.706
- Thank you so much, nice to meet you.

01:07:32.707 --> 01:07:34.767
- Sir, you're fired.

01:07:34.768 --> 01:07:36.081
See, it's that simple.

01:07:36.082 --> 01:07:38.081
- Can you get off
the phone for five seconds,

01:07:38.082 --> 01:07:40.589
we've gotta do this now.

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:41.423
- I understand that,

01:07:41.423 --> 01:07:42.256
but this guy is having a meltdown.

01:07:42.257 --> 01:07:43.695
- Ladies, please.

01:07:43.696 --> 01:07:45.345
Goddamn, this is why I only hire men.

01:07:45.346 --> 01:07:46.320
- You know what, I got an idea.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.171
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:07:47.172 --> 01:07:48.749
I'm gonna do the walk and talk.

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:49.583
- What?

01:07:49.584 --> 01:07:52.017
- He was my grandfather too,
I don't know why we didn't...

01:07:52.018 --> 01:07:52.851
- What, you gonna get dressed up as Todd?

01:07:52.852 --> 01:07:54.716
- Why didn't we think of this
before, why do we need him?

01:07:54.717 --> 01:07:55.584
- That's right, that's right, of course.

01:07:55.584 --> 01:07:56.417
- He's my grandfather.

01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:57.250
- It's his story.

01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:58.083
- It's her story too.

01:07:58.084 --> 01:08:00.731
- Hello, it's my story too, asshole.

01:08:00.732 --> 01:08:01.732
- Todd.

01:08:02.834 --> 01:08:04.151
Hey baby.

01:08:06.135 --> 01:08:06.976
- Sir.

01:08:06.977 --> 01:08:08.491
- I'm here.

01:08:08.492 --> 01:08:11.092
- Sir, I can't talk right now.

01:08:11.093 --> 01:08:14.891
- I know that, that's what I wanna hear.

01:08:14.892 --> 01:08:15.725
- Please...

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:16.591
- Good, let's talk.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.673
- I just need to be alone, please.

01:08:18.674 --> 01:08:22.145
- I want you to be alone with me.

01:08:22.147 --> 01:08:23.857
You know what I mean.

01:08:23.858 --> 01:08:27.707
There's no loneliness like
loneliness with another fellow.

01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:30.322
- Can we shoot it over here,

01:08:30.323 --> 01:08:31.156
- No.

01:08:31.157 --> 01:08:32.639
- And not near the edge?

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.559
- I'll tell
you, Greg, we'll have you

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.734
facing away from the cliff...

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:36.926
- Be a man will ya, come on, here.

01:08:36.928 --> 01:08:38.478
- Todd?

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:39.634
- Yes.

01:08:39.635 --> 01:08:40.968
- I need to pee.

01:08:43.881 --> 01:08:46.881
Can I come in to pee, just a minute.

01:08:48.698 --> 01:08:51.009
- Benevento,
listen to me for a second.

01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:51.843
We're gonna have to go to the mall

01:08:51.844 --> 01:08:53.080
because I can't,

01:08:53.081 --> 01:08:54.113
Mike I can't,

01:08:54.115 --> 01:08:54.948
- No, you look great.

01:08:54.948 --> 01:08:56.147
- No, I cannot wear my speed thrill shirt

01:08:56.148 --> 01:08:56.981
- You look beautiful.

01:08:56.981 --> 01:08:57.853
- I need something professional looking.

01:08:57.853 --> 01:08:58.685
- We don't have time to do it.

01:08:58.685 --> 01:08:59.519
- Well then it's gonna look stupid.

01:08:59.519 --> 01:09:00.352
- It's gonna take a 15
minute hike to go up the...

01:09:00.353 --> 01:09:02.335
- I wish Curly had gotten hit by a bus.

01:09:02.336 --> 01:09:03.557
- No cameras all right, please.

01:09:03.558 --> 01:09:05.703
- No fucking cameras.

01:09:05.703 --> 01:09:07.813
No fucking cameras guys,

01:09:07.814 --> 01:09:09.314
what with the fuck these cameras.

01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:12.277
It's over, no more cameras.

01:09:12.278 --> 01:09:14.600
Turn everything off.

01:09:14.602 --> 01:09:17.317
You know, you go kill yourself.

01:09:17.318 --> 01:09:18.930
Okay where's the bathroom?

01:09:18.932 --> 01:09:20.433
- Just use the
restroom, it's in there,

01:09:20.434 --> 01:09:21.403
and then please...

01:09:21.404 --> 01:09:22.799
- That's a nice bathroom,
yeah I like that.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.602
And that's a nice room too, huh?

01:09:24.603 --> 01:09:25.658
- No, sir, listen.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:29.144
- Here, just, can you just get like that?

01:09:29.145 --> 01:09:30.816
- You want me to zoom in just on her face?

01:09:30.817 --> 01:09:31.852
- Yeah, that's right.

01:09:31.853 --> 01:09:32.685
- Let me ask you something,

01:09:32.685 --> 01:09:33.624
how are we gonna know it's a cliff?

01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:35.328
- You see water for god's sake.

01:09:35.328 --> 01:09:36.687
- But I'm zooming in on her,

01:09:36.688 --> 01:09:37.859
the background's gonna be her ear.

01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:38.693
- He's gonna see it in my eyes.

01:09:38.694 --> 01:09:39.721
- How are you gonna
know you're at a cliff?

01:09:39.723 --> 01:09:40.555
- You'll see it in my eyes.

01:09:40.557 --> 01:09:41.893
- You'll see it in her eyes.

01:09:41.894 --> 01:09:43.616
- This whole
thing has been a fiasco,

01:09:43.617 --> 01:09:44.450
do you understand?

01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:48.423
I look like a fool, I need
you to get outta here, please.

01:09:48.424 --> 01:09:49.542
- I know, I understand that.

01:09:49.544 --> 01:09:51.143
- Just make it about them.

01:09:51.144 --> 01:09:52.140
I have failed this,

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:53.786
This is what I do, I fail everything.

01:09:53.787 --> 01:09:55.744
I need you to leave me.

01:09:55.745 --> 01:09:59.821
- You have not
failed, never, never.

01:09:59.822 --> 01:10:01.535
Who's telling you that?

01:10:01.536 --> 01:10:02.702
Ivan.

01:10:02.703 --> 01:10:04.512
You think I'm a failure?

01:10:04.513 --> 01:10:05.346
- No, you're great.

01:10:05.346 --> 01:10:06.179
- No.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.891
And do you think I know a failure

01:10:07.892 --> 01:10:09.642
when I see a failure?

01:10:10.676 --> 01:10:12.614
What do you think, do I?

01:10:12.615 --> 01:10:13.448
I do.

01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:14.364
- Yeah, all right, all right, yeah.

01:10:14.365 --> 01:10:17.781
- I do, so you are a huge success.

01:10:18.683 --> 01:10:19.516
- Put it out there, pal.

01:10:19.517 --> 01:10:21.238
- Okay let's get this
out, I'm ready, one take.

01:10:21.239 --> 01:10:22.753
Let's do it.
- Rolling.

01:10:22.754 --> 01:10:24.843
- Let me ask you one
question, quick question.

01:10:24.844 --> 01:10:28.844
Do you think I have a big
dick, or a small dick?

01:10:29.966 --> 01:10:33.022
- Look, just concentrate on my eyes.

01:10:33.023 --> 01:10:35.684
- I'm right here, right here with you.

01:10:35.685 --> 01:10:36.580
- Sir, you...

01:10:36.581 --> 01:10:38.852
- With you, look in my eye.

01:10:38.853 --> 01:10:41.199
Who's right here with you?

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.698
Soul

01:10:42.699 --> 01:10:43.699
to soul.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:47.286
- Ahaa, Ahaa...

01:10:47.287 --> 01:10:48.882
- Here, here on these cliffs.

01:10:48.883 --> 01:10:50.440
- We gotta cut it, Greg, Greg,

01:10:50.441 --> 01:10:51.517
we gotta cut it.

01:10:51.518 --> 01:10:53.658
- You can't make noise like
that while I'm talking.

01:10:53.659 --> 01:10:54.492
- Oh, I can hear my noise.

01:10:54.493 --> 01:10:55.513
- Can we get him something?

01:10:55.514 --> 01:10:57.345
- Do you feel the dignity?

01:10:57.346 --> 01:10:58.346
Tell me,

01:10:59.607 --> 01:11:01.024
you feel dignity?

01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:03.782
- No, I don't feel dignity.

01:11:03.783 --> 01:11:06.680
- Excellent, that's what I wanted to hear.

01:11:06.681 --> 01:11:08.431
Now you will feel it.

01:11:09.491 --> 01:11:11.597
I will give it to you.

01:11:11.598 --> 01:11:12.431
- I'm ready.

01:11:12.431 --> 01:11:13.422
- Go.

01:11:13.422 --> 01:11:14.255
- Here...

01:11:14.256 --> 01:11:15.733
- Sound.

01:11:15.734 --> 01:11:16.753
- Speed.

01:11:16.754 --> 01:11:17.587
- Speed.

01:11:17.588 --> 01:11:19.140
- I see right through you.

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:22.622
I see the success, I see the big man.

01:11:22.623 --> 01:11:26.790
I see the man who counts,
the man who means something.

01:11:29.651 --> 01:11:31.495
You know who this is?

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:32.483
Who's this?

01:11:32.483 --> 01:11:33.372
- It's Elvis.

01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:34.650
- Elvis the King.

01:11:34.651 --> 01:11:37.807
Why do you think he was king?

01:11:37.808 --> 01:11:39.907
- He's very musical.

01:11:39.908 --> 01:11:43.491
Â™« Are you lonesome tonight

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.031
â™« Do you miss me tonight

01:11:49.032 --> 01:11:53.199
â™« Are you sorry we're drifting apart â™«

01:11:55.361 --> 01:11:57.027
- Is everyone ready?

01:11:58.929 --> 01:12:02.833
- Marcy came in and she
infiltrated this whole thing,

01:12:02.834 --> 01:12:04.894
which is so like her.

01:12:04.895 --> 01:12:06.827
She's been doing that since we were kids.

01:12:06.828 --> 01:12:07.661
- She's a con job.

01:12:07.662 --> 01:12:09.908
- But I let her in.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:11.030
- Here on these cliffs.

01:12:11.031 --> 01:12:12.161
- I know, I know, I know.

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:14.829
- What do you think about death?

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:20.183
- I'm the only boy in my family.

01:12:20.184 --> 01:12:25.033
- My grandfather, Elmo, known
to his friends as Curly,

01:12:25.034 --> 01:12:28.117
may, or may not, have met his demise.

01:12:29.974 --> 01:12:30.974
You decide.

01:12:32.022 --> 01:12:35.450
- There was somethin' in me
that was like my grandfather,

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:38.465
and I never even met my grandfather.

01:12:38.466 --> 01:12:39.814
But I'll tell you something,

01:12:39.815 --> 01:12:41.746
he was this desperate guy,

01:12:41.747 --> 01:12:45.080
and he could never find anything, and...

01:12:46.257 --> 01:12:49.424
- But he's happy now, did'nt he?

01:12:51.197 --> 01:12:52.489
- 'Kay let's go, let's go.

01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:53.765
- Baby, you wanna get over here,

01:12:53.766 --> 01:12:55.982
were makin' your movie,
we're doin' this for you.

01:12:55.983 --> 01:12:57.940
- Let's go, let's go.

01:13:15.586 --> 01:13:18.098
- Is your life outta control?

01:13:18.099 --> 01:13:22.182
Or is in perfect order,
and you're outta control.

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.252
When you look in the mirror,

01:13:25.959 --> 01:13:28.075
who's lookin' back?

01:13:28.076 --> 01:13:29.076
You.

01:13:31.502 --> 01:13:33.669
People who walk backwards,

01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:37.017
only see what they've already done.

01:13:37.018 --> 01:13:37.851
- Todd.

01:13:37.851 --> 01:13:38.684
- Hey Greg.

01:13:38.685 --> 01:13:39.759
- What the hell, hey, no hang on...

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.593
- I gotta lie down.

01:13:40.594 --> 01:13:42.044
- No, you can't smoke in here, dude.

01:13:42.045 --> 01:13:44.221
You can't smoke, put that cigarette out.

01:13:44.222 --> 01:13:46.177
Just come out here.

01:13:46.178 --> 01:13:47.045
My god, where have you been?

01:13:47.046 --> 01:13:49.634
- Over here, over here, over here.

01:13:49.635 --> 01:13:52.395
- Okay, have a seat, have a seat.

01:13:52.396 --> 01:13:54.327
- How's Rebecca?

01:13:54.328 --> 01:13:56.831
- She's fine I guess.

01:13:56.832 --> 01:14:00.336
I mean she's pretty depressed
if you wanna know the truth.

01:14:00.337 --> 01:14:02.048
- Listen Greg, I am sorry.

01:14:02.049 --> 01:14:02.965
- What for?

01:14:02.966 --> 01:14:05.468
- I am sorry I dragged
all you guys into this.

01:14:05.469 --> 01:14:07.446
- No, don't be sorry,
we're sorry that you left.

01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:08.859
- This is so stupid.

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:09.802
- You gotta come back,

01:14:09.803 --> 01:14:12.122
you gotta take the reigns
back from that asshole.

01:14:12.123 --> 01:14:13.198
- He's an asshole.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.303
- That's what, he's an asshole.

01:14:14.304 --> 01:14:15.770
- He's pathological.

01:14:15.771 --> 01:14:18.597
- He's a pathological asshole.

01:14:18.598 --> 01:14:21.389
- Now don't
let others do to you,

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:23.968
what you can do to yourself.

01:14:23.969 --> 01:14:26.459
- It's turned into this
whole other story now.

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:29.938
I signed up for something
about feminist empowerment,

01:14:29.939 --> 01:14:33.310
and now it's a Marcy
makin' it into a story

01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:36.323
about this Curly guy, and what is he?

01:14:36.324 --> 01:14:37.324
He's a

01:14:38.578 --> 01:14:39.997
deadbeat dad is what he is.

01:14:39.998 --> 01:14:40.996
- Don't say that Greg.

01:14:40.996 --> 01:14:41.871
- He was.

01:14:41.872 --> 01:14:43.240
- Don't say that.

01:14:43.241 --> 01:14:44.751
- I don't care if he had a hard life.

01:14:44.752 --> 01:14:47.477
He killed himself or just
took off or whatever.

01:14:47.478 --> 01:14:49.433
That guy had three daughters and a wife,

01:14:49.434 --> 01:14:50.721
and you don't do that kinda thing.

01:14:50.722 --> 01:14:52.637
- His life was completely unmanageable.

01:14:52.638 --> 01:14:53.892
- Why does he get to
have a movie about him?

01:14:53.893 --> 01:14:55.144
- Haven't you ever felt like there's just,

01:14:55.145 --> 01:14:57.863
there's nothing you can do?

01:14:57.864 --> 01:15:00.765
Like there's nothing you can do.

01:15:00.766 --> 01:15:05.059
Haven't you ever just
wanted to like, disappear?

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:07.744
- That's what darkness is.

01:15:07.745 --> 01:15:08.828
Moving light.

01:15:09.897 --> 01:15:14.064
Turns into darkness, just
when the cucumber's ready.

01:15:15.828 --> 01:15:17.941
- I don't how you people
do it in movieland,

01:15:17.942 --> 01:15:20.299
but in the corporate world,
when you're suppose to show up,

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:21.785
you show up.

01:15:21.786 --> 01:15:23.611
- We're not exactly
making it easy for Todd.

01:15:23.612 --> 01:15:24.445
- Has he called?

01:15:24.446 --> 01:15:26.225
- I have spoken to Todd, he will be here,

01:15:26.226 --> 01:15:28.083
he's dealing with some stuff, maybe later.

01:15:28.084 --> 01:15:29.358
- Well, dealing with some stuff.

01:15:29.359 --> 01:15:30.192
- Well we have to be patient.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.746
- We gotta a thing to make here.

01:15:32.747 --> 01:15:35.693
What do you call, a production.

01:15:35.694 --> 01:15:36.825
This can't go on anymore,

01:15:36.826 --> 01:15:39.812
and I want this to be
a lesson to all of you.

01:15:39.813 --> 01:15:43.110
Listen very carefully
because Marcy has a plan,

01:15:43.111 --> 01:15:44.673
and this is the plan we're gonna follow.

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:46.191
- I really think you
guys are gonna like this.

01:15:46.192 --> 01:15:47.813
This is gonna be a little
bit more responsibility for

01:15:47.814 --> 01:15:49.113
you Hannah, but this is great.

01:15:49.114 --> 01:15:50.320
It's gonna be a good moment for you,

01:15:50.321 --> 01:15:52.336
good time for you, good opportunity.

01:15:52.337 --> 01:15:55.321
We're gonna do everything with
the camera as Curly's POV.

01:15:55.322 --> 01:15:56.155
- What?

01:15:56.155 --> 01:15:56.988
- We're not gonna have Curly in the scene.

01:15:56.989 --> 01:15:58.806
It's all gonna be, the
camera's gonna be shooting

01:15:58.807 --> 01:16:00.491
Shirley and Patty, the entire time...

01:16:00.492 --> 01:16:01.325
- As though the camera were Curly?

01:16:01.326 --> 01:16:02.843
- And Curly will be a VOICEOVER.

01:16:02.844 --> 01:16:03.677
- A voice?

01:16:03.678 --> 01:16:04.840
- I think it'll be great,
it's gonna work great.

01:16:04.841 --> 01:16:05.674
- It's perfect, it's perfect.

01:16:05.674 --> 01:16:06.507
- We have to discuss this
with Todd, obviously.

01:16:06.507 --> 01:16:07.340
- It's gonna work great.

01:16:07.341 --> 01:16:08.840
Well we can't discuss it
with Todd, he's not here.

01:16:08.841 --> 01:16:11.048
- It's been decided, let's
get ready, let's get going.

01:16:11.049 --> 01:16:13.076
And you and tall guy, no more beers,

01:16:13.077 --> 01:16:14.877
I need you sharp for the shoot.

01:16:14.878 --> 01:16:17.061
- Sharp for the shoot.
- Okay, let's go.

01:16:17.062 --> 01:16:18.291
- Isn't that Todd?

01:16:18.292 --> 01:16:19.125
- Todd.

01:16:19.126 --> 01:16:20.197
- Ah, thank you.

01:16:21.431 --> 01:16:22.306
- Hi everybody.

01:16:22.307 --> 01:16:23.337
- Well, you decide to Dane
up with your presence.

01:16:23.338 --> 01:16:24.171
- Sorry for my absence.

01:16:24.171 --> 01:16:25.005
- Gee, it's only Wednesday.

01:16:25.005 --> 01:16:25.907
- All right, good to see you.

01:16:25.908 --> 01:16:27.114
- Okay, we're gonna shoot this right now,

01:16:27.115 --> 01:16:28.167
but in the house, in the house.

01:16:28.168 --> 01:16:29.024
- We'll shoot it inside?

01:16:29.025 --> 01:16:30.370
- In the house.

01:16:30.371 --> 01:16:31.204
- I think that's a good idea,

01:16:31.205 --> 01:16:32.744
I think the house is a
better location than this.

01:16:32.745 --> 01:16:33.785
- Good, somebody
call me when it's done.

01:16:33.786 --> 01:16:34.772
- We're gonna make this work.

01:16:34.773 --> 01:16:38.793
- And by the way,
I may fight like a girl,

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:40.877
but I'm a great big girl.

01:16:42.323 --> 01:16:45.539
- All right little
girl, let's look sharp now.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:49.123
- So, what is the state
capital of Alabama?

01:16:51.364 --> 01:16:52.707
- I forgot.

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:54.753
- Georgia?

01:16:54.754 --> 01:16:56.118
- Atlanta.

01:16:56.119 --> 01:16:57.952
- Very good, ahhh, hi.

01:16:58.935 --> 01:16:59.768
- Hello.

01:16:59.768 --> 01:17:00.601
- Hi.

01:17:00.601 --> 01:17:01.434
- Do you want a little coffee?

01:17:01.435 --> 01:17:03.101
- No, no, it's fine.

01:17:11.873 --> 01:17:13.373
I'm going golfing.

01:17:15.403 --> 01:17:17.653
- Have a good game.

01:17:19.353 --> 01:17:20.353
- Okay,

01:17:21.153 --> 01:17:22.222
that was

01:17:22.223 --> 01:17:23.312
really good, break.
- Say cut.

01:17:23.313 --> 01:17:24.729
- Break, that was good because it,

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:28.674
it's like I thought that
he was your husband,

01:17:28.675 --> 01:17:30.771
and I thought that he was your father.

01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:34.014
I think we got someplace here, very good.

01:17:34.015 --> 01:17:35.775
- I thought,

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:36.684
so let's just go again, let's go again.

01:17:36.684 --> 01:17:37.517
- Do you wanna do it again?

01:17:37.517 --> 01:17:38.350
- Just go again right away.

01:17:38.351 --> 01:17:39.940
- Then we better do it again right away.

01:17:39.941 --> 01:17:41.471
Where's the guy?

01:17:41.472 --> 01:17:42.305
- Todd.

01:17:42.305 --> 01:17:43.138
- Todd, we're doin' it again, Todd.

01:17:43.139 --> 01:17:45.424
- Back to one.

01:17:45.425 --> 01:17:47.007
- Hello.

01:17:47.008 --> 01:17:48.328
- Is he out, did
he leave, is he outside?

01:17:48.329 --> 01:17:49.312
- Yeah he said
he needed a little walk.

01:17:49.312 --> 01:17:50.304
- Rod, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch, ch.

01:17:50.304 --> 01:17:51.279
- He's just
takin' a little break.

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.751
- Wait, he's sayin' somethin' to me.

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:55.776
He's muttering something.

01:17:55.777 --> 01:17:58.653
He says he really is going golfing.

01:17:58.654 --> 01:18:00.077
- Well, no, but we need
him in here to do the...

01:18:00.078 --> 01:18:01.732
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, whoa, whoa,

01:18:01.733 --> 01:18:02.566
wait a second.

01:18:02.567 --> 01:18:03.673
He just said he really is going golfing?

01:18:03.674 --> 01:18:05.885
- Yeah he just said goodbye,
to say goodbye to everyone,

01:18:05.886 --> 01:18:07.386
I'm going golfing.

01:18:08.236 --> 01:18:09.069
- If he's gonna be anywhere,

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:11.069
it's gonna be down here.

01:18:12.402 --> 01:18:13.402
Oh my gosh.

01:18:18.044 --> 01:18:19.081
Oh my gosh.

01:18:19.082 --> 01:18:20.783
- What, what's that?

01:18:20.784 --> 01:18:22.867
- What is that?

01:18:24.331 --> 01:18:25.331
Oh no.

01:18:46.615 --> 01:18:48.298
- We're deep into the film,

01:18:48.299 --> 01:18:51.132
and it's looking better than ever.

01:18:51.973 --> 01:18:52.806
I don't know if you remember,

01:18:52.807 --> 01:18:55.561
but you probably didn't,
I had a lot a rage.

01:18:55.562 --> 01:18:58.758
And I've really learned to let go.

01:18:58.759 --> 01:19:00.795
- Well he's had to take some classes, so.

01:19:00.796 --> 01:19:03.810
- Well, yeah it's film classes I...

01:19:03.811 --> 01:19:05.796
- It was court-ordered.

01:19:05.797 --> 01:19:07.714
- Welcome to our place.

01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:11.140
Yep, we're living here now.

01:19:12.663 --> 01:19:14.163
It's little tight.

01:19:15.856 --> 01:19:17.708
- Wow, I miss all this.

01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:19.650
- My main goal, and a real money-maker,

01:19:19.651 --> 01:19:21.429
is an idea that I've come up with myself.

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:23.718
Which is a moviemercial.

01:19:23.719 --> 01:19:28.142
- You know, you really had
an influence on me yourself.

01:19:28.143 --> 01:19:32.661
And, I bought your latest,
Letting Go of Reality.

01:19:32.662 --> 01:19:35.801
And I also, not only that,
but I got the large print

01:19:35.802 --> 01:19:36.820
edition as well.

01:19:36.821 --> 01:19:37.958
- Instead of being contained in sort of

01:19:37.959 --> 01:19:39.664
30 second commercial,

01:19:39.665 --> 01:19:41.264
30 minute infomercial,

01:19:41.265 --> 01:19:44.156
you got a 120 minute,
180 minute moviemercial,

01:19:44.157 --> 01:19:46.425
where you are just focused on the product.

01:19:46.426 --> 01:19:50.426
- The most important thing
is my love of coffee.

01:19:52.927 --> 01:19:54.030
Coffee.

01:19:54.031 --> 01:19:56.779
- If you could just sign
this, maybe a little later,

01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:58.738
but more important, I was hoping,

01:19:58.739 --> 01:20:01.852
would you maybe consider getting involved?

01:20:01.853 --> 01:20:02.704
You followed this for a long time.

01:20:02.705 --> 01:20:05.128
- You know, this probably
isn't the best time to,

01:20:05.129 --> 01:20:05.962
why don't we talk to him...

01:20:05.963 --> 01:20:07.144
- No, it is, 'cause this is part a the,

01:20:07.145 --> 01:20:07.978
why don't we do this...

01:20:07.979 --> 01:20:09.730
- Why don't we talk to
him when he's off camera

01:20:09.731 --> 01:20:11.561
about that, 'cause it might embarrass him

01:20:11.562 --> 01:20:12.395
into feeling like he has to...

01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:14.229
- No, we're filmmakers, it's family...

01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:15.833
- You know what though,
would you like some...

01:20:15.834 --> 01:20:16.667
- Take the camera.

01:20:16.667 --> 01:20:17.500
- I think we should...

01:20:17.501 --> 01:20:19.310
- And let's shoot, let's
shoot us shooting him.

01:20:19.311 --> 01:20:21.500
- Why don't we have some
co, could you make us some

01:20:21.501 --> 01:20:22.542
coffee right now for us?

01:20:22.543 --> 01:20:23.651
- Coffee, you want coffee?

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:26.638
- Do you remember how we got
that bag of the french roast,

01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:27.829
which is just great.

01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:29.863
It would be great if we could
have some a that right now.

01:20:29.864 --> 01:20:31.234
- You want a beer?

01:20:31.235 --> 01:20:32.546
- You know nothing in life is perfect.

01:20:32.547 --> 01:20:34.969
- But honestly, that's a
big thing, that I think...

01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:36.761
- Yeah, that's a big
thing that I think we've

01:20:36.762 --> 01:20:37.922
come to terms with,

01:20:37.923 --> 01:20:40.514
is not like just searching for the dream.

01:20:40.515 --> 01:20:42.427
We like, when we jumped into this movie,

01:20:42.428 --> 01:20:44.286
this will save us, this
will make my life perfect,

01:20:44.287 --> 01:20:45.701
this will solve everything.

01:20:45.702 --> 01:20:48.727
And I think there's a realization that

01:20:48.728 --> 01:20:51.847
nothing's gonna do that,
nothing's gonna do that, right?

01:20:51.848 --> 01:20:53.097
- It's not about that.

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:56.431
- She's a hell of a woman, and, oh fuck,

01:20:57.782 --> 01:21:00.966
and the thing is, it's like I've really,

01:21:00.967 --> 01:21:02.147
I've met my soulmate.

01:21:02.148 --> 01:21:06.315
- I'm out, I'm
so out of this, I'm out.

01:21:07.705 --> 01:21:10.584
I have found some investors on my own,

01:21:10.585 --> 01:21:15.514
and Mike is a wonderful
sweet man, and he means well,

01:21:15.515 --> 01:21:17.956
but it's not enough.

01:21:17.957 --> 01:21:20.405
It's just not enough.

01:21:20.406 --> 01:21:25.121
I'm ashamed of the way I
behaved in certain ways.

01:21:25.122 --> 01:21:28.631
- Did you think he could kill himself?

01:21:28.632 --> 01:21:30.969
This little bastard,

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:34.457
he has tiny balls, like a rabbit.

01:21:34.458 --> 01:21:37.076
A bunny.

01:21:37.077 --> 01:21:41.350
Have you ever heard of
a bunny killing himself?

01:21:41.351 --> 01:21:43.443
I don't think so.

01:21:43.444 --> 01:21:44.444
- Rod.

01:21:58.422 --> 01:22:00.896
- I would never wanna
do anything to dishonor

01:22:00.897 --> 01:22:02.147
my grandfather.

01:22:05.575 --> 01:22:08.908
I thought that I wanted to do something.

01:22:09.889 --> 01:22:12.889
But I really wanted to be something.

01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:17.638
And now I feel like, I am something.

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:51.684
- I feel like I've grown,
and that's what enables me

01:22:51.685 --> 01:22:54.361
to write this column, it's
an advice column, and...

01:22:54.362 --> 01:22:55.762
- That's exactly
it, that's exactly it.

01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:56.596
- Yeah, and...

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:57.794
- I think it's because
you bring your experience

01:22:57.795 --> 01:22:59.982
to it, you bring how
much you've been through,

01:22:59.983 --> 01:23:01.719
that the column is such a hit.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.637
- He's so supportive,
it's just so different.

01:23:03.638 --> 01:23:04.471
You know to be with someone
- We get like four

01:23:04.471 --> 01:23:05.416
who's so supportive.
- or five emails a day,

01:23:05.417 --> 01:23:08.247
just saying I love your
column, I read it every week.

01:23:08.248 --> 01:23:11.248
- If it isn't fixed, don't break it.

01:23:13.884 --> 01:23:15.801
Doesn't make any sense.

01:23:20.648 --> 01:23:24.352
- So my blog is at, well
it's not MarcylsAFraud.com

01:23:24.353 --> 01:23:25.565
because that was reserved, so I have

01:23:25.566 --> 01:23:28.368
MarcylsAFraud. biz, B-I-Z.

01:23:28.369 --> 01:23:30.784
And it's a lot punchier, 'cause
people remember that more.

01:23:30.785 --> 01:23:34.169
- Well I think that you need
to ease up on all a that,

01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:35.093
don't you?

01:23:35.094 --> 01:23:38.502
You look so distressed,
and obsessed with her,

01:23:38.503 --> 01:23:40.170
and your blog and...

01:23:41.451 --> 01:23:44.258
- I think you're misunderstanding me,

01:23:44.259 --> 01:23:45.092
It's not an angry thing...

01:23:45.092 --> 01:23:46.071
- I'm sure I probably am.

01:23:46.071 --> 01:23:47.025
Are you sure it's not?

01:23:47.026 --> 01:23:49.011
- I'm just getting the word out about

01:23:49.012 --> 01:23:50.426
all the things she's done.

01:23:50.427 --> 01:23:52.445
I don't, it's about the truth about her.

01:23:52.446 --> 01:23:56.613
About her taking over the
reins, being villainess.

01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:03.017
- Franz, did you get my letters?

01:24:03.018 --> 01:24:04.188
It's really good to,

01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:05.689
I'm sorry, gotcha.

01:24:07.131 --> 01:24:11.070
- The fact that they're
together tells you something.

01:24:11.071 --> 01:24:15.383
Mike found us in Spokane,
through credit card bills.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:16.217
Right?

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:17.050
- Right, right.

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:18.571
- Now how did he find us in San Diego?

01:24:18.572 --> 01:24:19.922
Somebody tipped him off.

01:24:19.923 --> 01:24:20.954
Who would've tipped him off?

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:22.267
Of course it was Marcy.

01:24:22.268 --> 01:24:23.101
- Marcy.

01:24:23.102 --> 01:24:24.784
- Who else would do that.

01:24:24.785 --> 01:24:29.187
- That's great.

01:24:29.188 --> 01:24:30.492
- I'm working on my book, I'm doing a...

01:24:30.493 --> 01:24:32.267
- Oh my god, he's doing this amazing book.

01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:36.888
- A book of photo essays
of women in my family,

01:24:36.889 --> 01:24:37.722
- It's beautiful.

01:24:37.723 --> 01:24:38.985
- Not quite ready to
talk about, but but...

01:24:38.986 --> 01:24:39.989
- It's really beautiful.

01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.867
- It's nice.

01:24:40.868 --> 01:24:41.901
- It's nice, it's amazing.

01:24:41.902 --> 01:24:42.967
I don't whether it'll be
a book, or be published,

01:24:42.968 --> 01:24:46.551
but there'll be some
nice pictures of them.

01:24:47.804 --> 01:24:50.240
I think there should be
some nice pictures of them.

01:24:50.241 --> 01:24:51.787
- Yeah, they're really nice.

01:24:51.788 --> 01:24:54.168
- It's the first thing
I've ever committed to

01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:56.586
that didn't confuse me a lot.

01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:00.687
- If it was so unimportant,

01:25:00.688 --> 01:25:03.490
why would I get so any hits every day?

01:25:03.491 --> 01:25:05.487
- Hits, remind me what that means.

01:25:05.488 --> 01:25:07.341
- Well, it means people check out my site.

01:25:07.342 --> 01:25:10.107
There are hundred, every
time you click on the site

01:25:10.108 --> 01:25:12.771
I get recognition that
somebody's checked out my site,

01:25:12.772 --> 01:25:14.410
and I get like a hundred a day.

01:25:14.411 --> 01:25:15.504
Oopp, somebody else checked out,

01:25:15.505 --> 01:25:17.573
somebody else has checked it out.

01:25:17.574 --> 01:25:18.575
