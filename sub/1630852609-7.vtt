WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.237
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.771
I feel very attacked!

00:04.771 --> 00:07.808
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.544
Oh, my God.

00:10.544 --> 00:14.348
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.348 --> 00:18.352
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.254
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.254 --> 00:22.956
you're only getting
half the story.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.659
Director: That's a break
on the main stage.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.994
All cameras re-po.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.265
RuPaul: DeJa Skye.
Kerri Colby.

00:31.265 --> 00:34.268
Angeria Paris VanMichaels.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.204
You are safe.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.906
You may leave the stage.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.646
Careful of my train, y'all.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.714
Careful of my Cher, bitch.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.550
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.653
Breathe. Breathe.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.988
What the fuck?

00:56.890 --> 00:59.927
Whew! Thank you, Lord.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.328
Oh, my God.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.930
I'm just speechless.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.798
I just wanna
get off this stage right now

01:04.798 --> 01:06.266
before she change her mind.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.035
I'm just so happy right now

01:08.035 --> 01:11.038
that I am not going home.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.206
I was worried,
because I know the judges

01:13.206 --> 01:14.908
were a little critical of me.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.610
It's not a great feeling
to be safe,

01:16.610 --> 01:18.211
but at the same token,
it's a great feeling

01:18.211 --> 01:19.913
to be able to make it
to another week

01:19.913 --> 01:22.916
and prove them wrong.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.985
I'm relieved,

01:24.985 --> 01:27.421
because I did not do my best
on this challenge.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.824
So I'm completely happy
that I'm safe,

01:32.726 --> 01:34.795
Untucked cameras
to the werkroom.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.630
Copy that.
Here we go.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.532
-Yes!
-Oh, bitch!

01:38.532 --> 01:40.133
-Girl.
-Girl.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.201
Oh, thank God.

01:41.201 --> 01:43.670
-Thanks, RuPaul.
-Yes, yes, yes.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.372
-Honey.
-Thanks for that flatulence.

01:45.372 --> 01:47.107
A lot of cocktails
on this table.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.177
Saved by the gas, bitch.
Saved by the gas.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.378
Girl, let's get untucked.

01:51.378 --> 01:52.879
-[laughs]
-Honey.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.548
Uncle Fester.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.916
She farted.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.117
Uh-huh.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.652
[laughs]

01:58.652 --> 02:00.687
-Let's get into this.
-Get it out.

02:00.687 --> 02:03.223
In the moment, we all three
were in our heads.

02:03.223 --> 02:05.792
Watching the final product--

02:05.792 --> 02:07.961
-It came together.
-It came together.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.098
Honestly, bitch,
I don't know who on that stage

02:11.098 --> 02:12.265
is in the bottom.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.101
-I really can't tell.
-Yeah.

02:14.101 --> 02:15.969
What if every ho
on the stage, bitch--

02:15.969 --> 02:17.537
Is top.

02:17.537 --> 02:18.638
They did all do great.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.407
The majority
did really well.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.542
I will say
after walking off set,

02:22.542 --> 02:24.578
I felt awful.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.146
-I saw it all over your face.
-I did.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.814
Do you feel pressure

02:27.814 --> 02:29.349
because you've been
in only the top?

02:29.349 --> 02:30.917
Absolutely.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.319
You said you liked it
a week ago.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.454
No, bitch, I ain't never said
I liked the pressure.

02:34.454 --> 02:35.822
-You said you did.
-I didn't--

02:35.822 --> 02:37.090
You said bring the pressure.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.959
But that's 'cause
you were just at the top.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.660
Well, maybe so.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.129
But, girl,
like, it feel good

02:42.129 --> 02:43.563
when you're at the top.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.665
Btu at the same token,

02:45.665 --> 02:46.867
you know that the judges

02:46.867 --> 02:50.837
are expecting
a certain level from you now,

02:50.837 --> 02:52.039
and I'm, like, hmm.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.607
I think I liked it better

02:53.607 --> 02:56.076
when you didn't expect
much from me.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.144
Yeah.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.246
That's why
I appreciate Jasmine.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.381
Jasmine was like, girl, look.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.417
Every week I'm in my head
and you get me out,

03:03.417 --> 03:04.751
so I got you.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.520
They're about
to start getting ready.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.988
You got this.
Don't overstress.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.856
You got it.
Remember, have fun.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.792
I have full faith in you.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.727
All right, honey. Whew.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.362
Who would have
fucking thought?

03:15.362 --> 03:17.798
I know!
Look at Jasmine.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.332
She's growing up.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.534
Pulling me up
out of my hole and stuff.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.235
[laughs]

03:22.235 --> 03:24.971
Kerri, how do you feel
about your place,

03:24.971 --> 03:26.606
like, in the competition
right now?

03:26.606 --> 03:30.811
I am not what I was expecting.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.180
-Good or bad?
-I was expecting

03:33.180 --> 03:34.414
to kind of like
dominate the scene.

03:36.083 --> 03:39.519
But I think
the judges want me

03:39.519 --> 03:42.622
to come out
of what I'm used to.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.624
And here's the tea
about L.A., y'all.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.393
You don't have to do much.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.727
If you're really pretty,

03:47.727 --> 03:50.097
they worship
the shit out of you.

03:50.097 --> 03:53.266
But I think it developed
a false sense of confidence,

03:53.266 --> 03:55.602
and I do have to
remind myself sometimes

03:55.602 --> 03:58.038
in terms of drag, I'm new.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.573
It doesn't come off
like that, though.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.574
Thank you.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.575
Oh!

04:01.575 --> 04:04.244
Okurr!

04:04.244 --> 04:06.079
Are y'all guys
talking crap about us?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.447
I was talking
a lot of shit

04:07.447 --> 04:08.482
about Willow, girl.

04:08.482 --> 04:11.118
All kinds of shit, bitch.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.552
-What were you saying?
-Wanna sit down, baby?

04:12.552 --> 04:15.055
Ooh. We really
did not have an idea

04:15.055 --> 04:16.389
of who we thought was where.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.458
We really did not.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.593
So I want to know the tea.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.164
-What's the tea, Daya?
-Please tell us.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.398
Was there a top
and a bottom?

04:25.398 --> 04:29.136
So...we were all in the top.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.538
[cheering]

04:31.538 --> 04:33.740
Oh, girl, I'm a real bitch,

04:33.740 --> 04:37.844
and I can say
I would have placed me

04:37.844 --> 04:38.979
in that bottom.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.180
So that's why
I was, like, girl,

04:40.180 --> 04:42.282
the people that I thought
were in the top--

04:42.282 --> 04:43.350
We were so confused.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.751
I'm, like, what is going on?

04:44.751 --> 04:47.521
When y'all got called safe,
I was like, "What the fuck?"

04:47.521 --> 04:49.022
[all laugh]
I was like--

04:49.022 --> 04:50.757
Hold on, bitch, hold on.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.125
You trying to say
we was awful?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.126
We're not in the bottom.
We're safe, motherfucker.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.895
Yes.
[all laugh]

04:54.895 --> 04:56.496
I wanna know
what she said.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.165
Yeah, so Ru basically said

04:58.165 --> 05:01.067
that this week, we all impressed
the shit out of her.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.135
Yay!

05:02.135 --> 05:04.371
So, like, specifics.

05:04.371 --> 05:07.140
They told me that I looked like
I was, like, high fashion.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.709
I was so happy.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.978
Michelle, like, almost
made me cry for a second,

05:11.978 --> 05:15.248
because it just felt
so endearing.

05:15.248 --> 05:18.785
You came in with an intention,
and you delivered.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.454
This look, it is gor-geous.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.557
Everything about it
is high fashion.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.926
The hat, the hair
that you put with it,

05:25.926 --> 05:28.528
it's so, so good.

05:28.528 --> 05:31.131
Before they told us
we were all in the top,

05:31.131 --> 05:33.800
I was like, holy shit.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.503
Like, I can't imagine myself
being in the bottom,

05:36.503 --> 05:39.439
but maybe I am more delusional
than I thought I would be.

05:39.439 --> 05:42.709
So I am so happy.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.078
Miss Daya is just,
like, taking

05:45.078 --> 05:48.515
a round trip destination
to her feelings.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.218
So that was such
a fucking cool compliment.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.820
They said that it was nice
for me to break out,

05:53.820 --> 05:55.155
and, like, it's a good week.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.691
If I'm gonna break out,
now's the week to do it.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.192
She got great reviews
from the judges,

05:59.192 --> 06:03.330
and she's very much feeling
her competitive oats.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.564
What they're gonna do

06:04.564 --> 06:06.566
is they said they're
gonna choose a top two...

06:06.566 --> 06:07.901
Oh, my God!

06:07.901 --> 06:09.035
And they are going
to make whoever

06:09.035 --> 06:11.471
lip sync for the prize.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.340
Yes!

06:13.340 --> 06:15.141
I know. I was like, gagged,
because every, like--

06:15.141 --> 06:17.110
But, like, I feel so much better

06:17.110 --> 06:19.813
than I felt the past
couple of weeks, so...

06:19.813 --> 06:20.947
Let's have Miss Jorgeous
have her moment.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.685
I know. Damn,
y'all bitches talk a lot.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.954
-Ooh!
-It's true.

06:27.954 --> 06:29.189
Enough about me.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.191
No, they said they saw me
really trying this week,

06:31.191 --> 06:34.060
that RuPaul said that
he was having fun watching me.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.229
And I feel so good
knowing that, like,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.531
they're seeing me actually,
like, try in acting.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.601
Because, bitch, the last two
fucking acting challenges,

06:41.601 --> 06:43.436
girl, I was struggling.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.672
I definitely feel
so much more confident,

06:45.672 --> 06:48.174
and seeing myself
within the acting challenges

06:48.174 --> 06:53.213
get better and better, it's
like, okay, like, I can do this.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.615
They said that my look,
it wasn't necessarily chaps,

06:55.615 --> 06:58.518
but they loved it,
so they didn't really care.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.153
Well, of course they loved it,
because you were born for drag.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.622
-Thank you!
-[laughs]

07:02.622 --> 07:04.991
You were working the cameras
beautifully on set.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.393
Thank y'all so much.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.395
Well, my only question
for you, Miss Lady,

07:08.395 --> 07:11.464
is are you ready
to lip sync for your 5.000?

07:11.464 --> 07:15.568
Could this be the week
that you get the win?

07:15.568 --> 07:17.704
Every time we say that,
it doesn't fucking happen!

07:17.704 --> 07:19.806
[all laugh]
It ain't your week, bitch.

07:19.806 --> 07:23.710
I did in my mind think
now is the time to take a risk.

07:23.710 --> 07:27.347
I was really nervous,
doing this fucking reveal.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.283
-Oh!
-Oh!

07:30.283 --> 07:32.052
But they lived for it.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.387
Ru was just, like,
looking at me,

07:34.387 --> 07:35.555
and the world stopped.

07:35.555 --> 07:37.324
Like, they don't give you
any notes.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.292
And, like, it was
just such an honor

07:39.292 --> 07:41.494
for RuPaul to say that
to my face.

07:41.494 --> 07:43.430
You know when
it's, like, that good,

07:43.430 --> 07:44.664
I'm not even really
paying attention.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.033
I'm just like, yeah,
keep it coming!

07:47.033 --> 07:52.172
Wow, I'm just happy that
in an acting challenge--

07:52.172 --> 07:53.907
because my last two
acting challenges

07:53.907 --> 07:55.608
have been God-fucking-awful.

07:55.608 --> 07:56.776
We know.
We were there.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.078
Aah!

07:58.078 --> 08:01.081
Listen, bitch, let me
have my one moment, okay?

08:01.081 --> 08:03.683
-Shut the fuck up.
-Oh, okay.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.753
I feel really happy,

08:06.753 --> 08:08.588
because, like, I don't
see myself as someone

08:08.588 --> 08:10.890
who's like, funny and, like,
irreverent and things like that.

08:10.890 --> 08:11.991
So, like,
it just made me feel--

08:11.991 --> 08:13.493
A reverend?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.395
I don't know
if that's the right word.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.496
A minister.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.265
Okay, I have a question.
I have a question.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.000
Who did you guys
for sure think were tops?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.071
Camden and Bosco for sure.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.706
Camden and Bosco
is what we agreed on.

08:26.706 --> 08:30.210
These bitches don't think
I'm competition, I don't think.

08:30.210 --> 08:34.714
I have a lot in my arsenal,
if you know what I mean.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.149
I really think

08:36.149 --> 08:39.152
that it's going to be Camden
and Jasmine lip syncing.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.154
Ooh, I'm nervous,
I'm nervous.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.156
-Bring it, bitch.
-I will say this now.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.224
This is the best
acting challenge

08:44.224 --> 08:45.191
that has ever been on
Drag Race.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.227
-Yes, bitch!
-Yes!

08:47.227 --> 08:48.528
Them farts.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.563
I was laughing so damn hard.

08:50.563 --> 08:53.032
This is very much just, like,
them, like, fucking with us.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.970
-Yeah.
-And, like, they got us so good.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.471
The first one I thought was me.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.173
The second one, I was like--

09:00.173 --> 09:01.741
-I thought it was you, too.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:01.741 --> 09:05.545
I'm genuinely, though, so, so
happy that you three were safe.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.946
Because, like, all tea,

09:06.946 --> 09:08.982
Angeria, Kerri, and, like, DeJa,

09:08.982 --> 09:10.016
you three have,
like, been my rock

09:10.016 --> 09:11.284
through this entire competition.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.420
And you all are very
maternal feeling in a sense.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.487
In different ways. It feels--

09:14.487 --> 09:16.423
We're the aunties, bitch.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.124
I love you guys for that,
so thank you.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.292
And I just wanna say this
to Jasmine.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.828
What did I say, DeJa,
when they were not here?

09:21.828 --> 09:23.696
Basically that you
got her together.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.498
The fact that you were saying

09:25.498 --> 09:28.301
that I'm normally the one
that has to come to you.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.103
-Yes.
-Like, "Well, girl,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.337
you need to get
outta your head, girl."

09:31.337 --> 09:33.740
And I said, "Bitch,
Jasmine had to be the one

09:33.740 --> 09:35.809
to pull me up outta
that hole, girl," like--

09:35.809 --> 09:39.946
Girl, like, you literally,
like, from the beginning

09:39.946 --> 09:41.414
have coached me out of my head

09:41.414 --> 09:43.082
of, like,
overthinking and stuff.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.151
And I would feel horrible

09:45.151 --> 09:47.587
if I didn't do
at least the same thing

09:47.587 --> 09:49.155
when I know how you're feeling.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.558
Because you're my sister
forever, tried and true, bitch.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.226
I love you so much.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.096
It's so weird, you know,

09:57.096 --> 09:59.332
just being plunged
into a universe

09:59.332 --> 10:02.068
where we can't talk to anybody.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.870
I've been really,
really going through it,

10:03.870 --> 10:08.174
because I'm, like, extremely
attached to my mom and my dad,

10:08.174 --> 10:09.275
and I'm like...

10:09.275 --> 10:10.376
That's amazing.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.245
Like, this is the longest

10:12.245 --> 10:14.447
that I've ever, like, went,
like, not talking to them.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.815
I think it's, like,

10:15.815 --> 10:18.017
one of the scariest things
about being here, because--

10:18.017 --> 10:22.355
This necklace, my mum made
when she was pregnant with me.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.624
-Oh, wow.
-I legit, like--

10:24.624 --> 10:26.292
I haven't seen my mum
in two years.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.961
Like, I haven't hugged
her little body,

10:27.961 --> 10:31.064
and I secretly am hoping
that I get to lip sync to this,

10:31.064 --> 10:34.701
because, like, this is
the shit that she listened to,

10:34.701 --> 10:37.370
like, when she was, like, going
through a divorce with my dad.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.205
So I'm, like, I really hope

10:39.205 --> 10:41.708
I get to lip sync
wearing this fucking necklace.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.743
I don't know about you guys,

10:43.743 --> 10:46.746
but, like, the pandemic
really opened my eyes

10:46.746 --> 10:50.216
to what a horrible human being
I was to my mom.

10:50.216 --> 10:54.821
It just made me feel like
I'm a fucking horrible person

10:54.821 --> 10:56.389
for pushing my mom away,

10:56.389 --> 10:58.892
and she was doing
nothing but her best.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.894
And so the pandemic
really made me realize,

11:00.894 --> 11:04.864
like, I refuse to wake up
feeling on top of the world

11:04.864 --> 11:06.733
for something
like this Drag Race,

11:06.733 --> 11:10.403
and me being not able
to share it with someone

11:10.403 --> 11:13.573
who I pushed away because
of my own insecurities.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.808
This can't happen anymore,
and I need her in my life.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.947
Now, what y'all in here
talking about?

11:20.947 --> 11:23.683
Talking about mamas
and families and things.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.286
Girl, where your wig at?

11:26.286 --> 11:27.987
Aah, it was hot, bitch!

11:27.987 --> 11:30.089
Ladies, I wanna tell you this.

11:30.089 --> 11:33.426
I am so proud of you ladies.

11:33.426 --> 11:38.197
But I was back there watching
you talk about your families,

11:38.197 --> 11:40.066
and I just wanna
really touch on this.

11:40.066 --> 11:43.603
People really don't understand
how important it is

11:43.603 --> 11:47.240
for us LBGTQI and all
the other letters people

11:47.240 --> 11:51.010
to have our families
really support us,

11:51.010 --> 11:53.279
because I remember my story.

11:53.279 --> 11:56.549
I went out into the world,
got involved in a lot of things

11:56.549 --> 11:58.952
that I didn't really
wanna be involved in,

11:58.952 --> 12:01.854
and came back home
scarred, battered.

12:01.854 --> 12:05.358
My mother and I's relationship
was mended from that place.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.061
I often think about
the times of me wishing

12:08.061 --> 12:11.598
that I would have not shut
my mom out during my transition,

12:11.598 --> 12:14.601
and how I wouldn't have been
exposed to the harsh world

12:14.601 --> 12:17.236
the way that
I was exposed to it.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.806
But it grew me as a person,

12:19.806 --> 12:23.443
and I'm here right now
for RuPaul's Drag Race.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.144
Yeah, you're part
of the cast now.

12:25.144 --> 12:29.382
So what are you all expecting
from doing RuPaul's Drag Race?

12:29.382 --> 12:31.818
For me, like, I want
financial stability.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.152
Oh, I don't wanna cry.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.490
COVID has really
fucked me over,

12:37.490 --> 12:39.559
like, with finances
and things like that.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.228
And, like, I haven't even,
like, been, sometimes, like,

12:42.228 --> 12:44.163
even able to, like, afford
to put, like, food on the table.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.999
No.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.133
So, like, actually,
I'm just really looking

12:47.133 --> 12:48.801
to be able to, like, be stable.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.703
Listen, let me tell you this.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.506
God gave you the gift of drag.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.774
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.943
You take your gifts,
and you flip that around.

12:56.943 --> 12:57.944
-Yeah.
-Yes.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.312
You know, we go through
hard times,

12:59.312 --> 13:01.614
we fall down,
we don't stay down.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.083
-Boom!
-Yes!

13:04.083 --> 13:05.852
Now, my last little piece
is for you.

13:05.852 --> 13:09.489
Mama, you are a fierce
piece of puss.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.524
-Yes!
-[laughs]

13:11.524 --> 13:13.326
You are hot, baby!

13:13.326 --> 13:14.560
Thank you so much!

13:14.560 --> 13:16.829
I don't give a damn
what Michelle Visage say.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.264
I like those chaps.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.199
-Yeah!
-Thank you!

13:20.199 --> 13:22.301
You looked really good.
All of you ladies look good.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.336
Thank you.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.337
Everybody did a good job.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.738
Y'all was all tops.

13:25.738 --> 13:26.939
[cheering]

13:26.939 --> 13:28.908
Well, they were safe.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.710
[all laugh]
Okay, bitch!

13:30.710 --> 13:32.745
You motherfucking whore!

13:32.745 --> 13:34.347
Not too much.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.215
There's no more to say, right?

13:36.215 --> 13:38.084
All right, I love you ladies.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.585
-We love you.
-I love you.

13:39.585 --> 13:40.720
All right, y'all, all right.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.288
Now, how in the hell
you get outta here?

13:42.288 --> 13:43.322
That way.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.857
Oh. Now, wait a minute, bitch,

13:44.857 --> 13:46.926
-Bye, baby!
-Love you!

13:46.926 --> 13:49.829
-Love you, too!
-Yes!

13:49.829 --> 13:51.130
She is just
literally everything.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.231
She is.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.233
I'm so happy
I got to meet her, like--

13:54.233 --> 13:58.071
Has anyone ever thought
about transitioning?

13:58.071 --> 14:00.506
I've definitely thought
about transitioning,

14:00.506 --> 14:02.775
especially, like,
during the pandemic.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.411
Like, Bosco's something
that I use to, like,

14:05.411 --> 14:07.780
feel a lot of gender euphoria,

14:07.780 --> 14:10.083
and, like, I had to go
an entire year without her.

14:10.083 --> 14:14.821
I work in customer service,
so I'm spending my entire day

14:14.821 --> 14:17.557
being, like,
he/him'd X, Y, and Z.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.292
And, like, it's not out of hate.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.928
It's just because, like, they've
known me for five seconds.

14:21.928 --> 14:25.498
So, like, without Bosco,
living that life,

14:25.498 --> 14:27.200
like, I absolutely
thought about, like,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.368
do I want to transition?

14:29.368 --> 14:30.369
Right.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.305
And I've kind of
come to the point

14:32.305 --> 14:34.006
where, like,
I'm happy being nonbinary,

14:34.006 --> 14:39.011
but I do want to move
the lever over a little bit.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.146
Okay.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.181
Like, I'm figuring out
what I want to do.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.916
And I'm really lucky
to have a boyfriend

14:43.916 --> 14:45.852
who's, like,
very in it with me.

14:45.852 --> 14:46.853
Oh, I love that.

14:46.853 --> 14:49.522
He's, like,
do what makes you happy.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.992
-Oh!
-And I miss him so, so dearly.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.094
Yeah.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.295
Yeah, girl.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.264
I don't know
where I'm at right now,

14:58.264 --> 15:00.800
and I didn't, like...

15:00.800 --> 15:02.568
Before coming here,

15:02.568 --> 15:04.403
and I didn't...

15:04.403 --> 15:05.805
[exhales]

15:05.805 --> 15:09.876
I didn't think
I was gonna talk about this.

15:12.378 --> 15:15.281
Whatever you're
comfortable with, sister.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.218
Before coming here--

15:19.218 --> 15:21.888
Oh, my God.

15:21.888 --> 15:26.092
Let the emotions flow, baby.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.293
Yeah, I need your hand.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.328
Yeah, baby.

15:29.328 --> 15:32.732
Before coming here,
I was about to start hormones,

15:32.732 --> 15:35.201
and coming here, I was scared,

15:35.201 --> 15:37.837
and I didn't want to
have to go through that process

15:37.837 --> 15:39.572
while going through this.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.842
But, like, seeing Kerri,

15:42.842 --> 15:45.812
seeing how confident she is
in who she is,

15:45.812 --> 15:49.816
it just, like, further,
like, affirmed, like,

15:49.816 --> 15:52.084
what I've been feeling
my whole life.

15:52.084 --> 15:56.689
Like, I as well, like,
I definitely do, like,

15:56.689 --> 16:00.726
feel that, like, I am trans.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.830
[sobs]

16:03.830 --> 16:06.766
And I've been so scared
to say it.

16:06.766 --> 16:11.070
I have held back from it
for so long

16:11.070 --> 16:14.807
because I didn't
wanna hurt my dad.

16:14.807 --> 16:19.278
But, like, I can't lie
about it anymore.

16:19.278 --> 16:23.449
I am trans.

16:23.449 --> 16:26.252
How do you feel
having just said that?

16:26.252 --> 16:29.088
Happy.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.090
-Good.
-Good, girl.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.995
It's just, like, you, like,
your boyfriend is so supportive,

16:35.995 --> 16:38.464
and every boyfriend
at first, like,

16:38.464 --> 16:39.966
didn't even know
what a drag queen was.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.969
I would hide it,
because I was scared

16:42.969 --> 16:44.770
that, like,
he wouldn't accept me.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.340
But at this, like,
tipping point,

16:47.340 --> 16:51.510
I had to tell him,
and he was just like,

16:51.510 --> 16:53.512
"It's not my place
to judge you."

16:55.348 --> 16:57.550
"It's my place
to be here for you."

16:57.550 --> 17:00.953
I'm so thankful
that we have boyfriends

17:00.953 --> 17:05.191
that can, like, take that,
especially in the gay community.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.159
Like, he identifies as gay,

17:07.159 --> 17:09.695
so I didn't want his identity

17:09.695 --> 17:11.631
or things like that
to be messed up.

17:11.631 --> 17:17.336
But after this,
I am going to start therapy,

17:17.336 --> 17:19.906
and I'm going to start hormones,

17:19.906 --> 17:22.875
and I am going to get
to the place where I wanna be.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.277
Yes.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.646
And, like, Kerri,
you were, like,

17:26.646 --> 17:31.817
the idea of, like,
what I wanna be so bad.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.220
You are so beautiful.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.657
If I could even be half of that,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.825
I will be happy with my life.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.460
-Bitch, you are beautiful.
-Yeah.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.495
Thank you, baby.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.063
You are really gorgeous,

17:44.063 --> 17:48.901
and the energy that you need,
you hold in yourself.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.437
You don't have to look
outside yourself to find that,

17:51.437 --> 17:55.341
because the woman that you are
is housed within you.

17:55.341 --> 17:59.278
And the fact that you had the
strength to bring that forward

17:59.278 --> 18:02.081
is the affirmation
that you were needing

18:02.081 --> 18:05.418
to push yourself
into who you're going to be.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.621
When you know what you need,
go and get that.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.757
You owe it to yourself
to be happy

18:11.757 --> 18:13.492
and to live your life

18:13.492 --> 18:16.562
as the human being
that you want to be.

18:16.562 --> 18:19.899
That puts the "T"
in the "LGBTQ."

18:19.899 --> 18:22.601
-It is a family.
-Yes.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.204
Ladies, time for the main stage.
Come on.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.238
All right.

18:26.238 --> 18:28.808
Oh, you're gonna
fuck up my makeup.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.677
Y'all, quit
making me cry, bitches!

18:31.677 --> 18:33.012
[laughs]

18:33.012 --> 18:35.548
I love you, too,
so much, sister.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.818
I really love you so much,
and I'm so proud of you.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.053
That's not easy to do.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.188
It's not.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.222
RuPaul: Welcome back, ladies.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.091
I've made some decisions.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.626
Lady Camden.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.195
Daya Betty.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.496
The time has come

18:50.496 --> 18:52.465
for you to lip sync

18:52.465 --> 18:56.235
for the win!

19:01.374 --> 19:04.276
Lady Camden,
you're a winner, baby.

19:04.276 --> 19:07.413

19:07.413 --> 19:09.548
