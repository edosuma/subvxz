05:05.971 --> 05:07.014
Cheerio, lads.

05:07.139 --> 05:09.183
Keep your voice down, Croker!
You're not out yet.

05:09.308 --> 05:11.059
- Sorry, sir.
- Good luck, Charles.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.185
Bye-bye, Jack.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.478
Remember me
to the old woman, Charlie.

05:13.603 --> 05:15.062
I will, Harry. I will.

05:15.188 --> 05:17.106
Say hello to the big world for me,
Charlie.

05:17.231 --> 05:18.691
Bye-bye.

05:22.695 --> 05:25.031
Goodbye, Mr Bridger.

05:29.952 --> 05:33.247
Did you hear that?
He said, "Goodbye, Mr Bridger. "

05:33.372 --> 05:34.665
Well, he's going, Mr Bridger.

05:34.790 --> 05:37.585
Well, as long as he doesn't come back.
That's all I care.

05:37.710 --> 05:40.213
They say
he's going to do a job in Italy.

05:40.338 --> 05:42.590
Well, I hope he likes spaghetti.

05:42.715 --> 05:45.593
They serve it four times a day
in the Italian prisons.

05:54.936 --> 05:56.395
Charlie.

06:14.037 --> 06:18.959
Well, you're the last person
I expected to see, Lorna.

06:19.084 --> 06:22.546
Oh, Charlie, I've been counting the days.

06:22.671 --> 06:27.092
Yeah? Well, why didn't you come
and see me when I was inside then?

06:27.217 --> 06:29.886
Charlie, you know that's not my scene.

06:30.011 --> 06:32.806
I mean, can you see me sitting there
holding your hands across the table,

06:32.973 --> 06:37.435
with all those weeping wives around
with their howling kids,

06:37.561 --> 06:38.728
and then the guards looking at me

06:38.854 --> 06:41.439
as if I've got something
hidden up my dress?

06:43.859 --> 06:47.279
- I did miss you, Charlie.
- Yeah?

06:48.655 --> 06:53.076
I made an appointment
for you to go to the tailor first.

06:53.201 --> 06:55.078
And then you go to the shirt maker
and...

06:55.203 --> 07:00.125
This car belongs
to the Pakistani ambassador.

07:01.334 --> 07:04.296
- It does?
- Typical, isn't it?

07:04.421 --> 07:08.091
I've been out of jail five minutes
and already I'm in a hot car.

07:08.216 --> 07:12.596
Charlie, I just wanted you
to come out in style, baby.

07:12.721 --> 07:13.805
Take me to my tailor.

07:14.014 --> 07:17.309
Very elegant, sir. I do believe
you've put on a little weight.

07:17.434 --> 07:19.393
Yes, well, I've been in America,
you see.

07:19.518 --> 07:21.437
It's the bread in the hamburgers.

07:21.562 --> 07:22.563
- Is that so?
- Yes.

07:22.688 --> 07:25.107
Well, I'm glad you're out. I mean, back.

07:25.858 --> 07:29.612
I don't want to be rude, Charles,
but times have changed.

07:29.737 --> 07:33.574
I'll tell you something, Adrian,
when I went in that was all the go.

07:34.658 --> 07:37.328
What did you do? Life?

07:38.162 --> 07:42.416
You know, Charles,
you could put all these in a museum.

07:42.791 --> 07:45.794
I'll tell you what I'll do with you, Adrian.
I'll tell you what I'll do.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.255
- I'll take this lot now, eh?
- Quite revolting.

07:48.839 --> 07:51.217
I'll take this lot now. You wrap them up.

07:51.342 --> 07:52.801
- And do us a favour, Adrian.
- Yeah.

07:52.927 --> 07:54.803
Shorten the sleeves will you, love?
I'm not a gorilla.

08:07.191 --> 08:10.820
Yes. Yes.
Well, there we are, Captain Croker.

08:10.945 --> 08:14.240
I think you'll find
we've kept it in perfect tone.

08:14.365 --> 08:16.826
I'll just run the engine for you, shall I?

08:16.951 --> 08:19.829
You'll be able to hear
what it sounds like.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.335
There we are. How's that?

08:26.460 --> 08:29.087
- I say.
- Yes?

08:29.212 --> 08:31.256
- I say.
- Hello?

08:32.799 --> 08:34.509
There you are.
I thought I'd lost you for a second.

08:34.634 --> 08:37.846
No, I came round here.
I was just thinking,

08:37.971 --> 08:39.764
maybe it needs a little more air...

08:39.889 --> 08:42.642
- Yeah.
... through the second carburettor.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.853
- Do you think so?
- Yeah, listen. There.

08:44.978 --> 08:46.020
- Yes, maybe you're right.
- Yes.

08:46.146 --> 08:49.399
- Yes. All right, I'll...
- No, I'll do it. Just stay there.

08:49.566 --> 08:52.569
Would you open the bonnet for me,
please?

08:52.694 --> 08:54.279
- Yes.
- Yes, thank you.

08:56.072 --> 08:58.700
- I wonder if you'd hold this for me?
- The...

08:58.825 --> 09:00.577
- The bonnet, yes.
- Oh, yes, of course.

09:00.702 --> 09:02.537
Thank you.

09:02.662 --> 09:05.206
- I didn't quite...
- Yes. There we are.

09:05.331 --> 09:07.792
- Do you want me to just...
- Hold. Thank you very much.

09:07.917 --> 09:09.919
- There we are.
- Now...

09:10.712 --> 09:13.381
- Yes. I can...
- How are you doing?

09:13.506 --> 09:16.968
I can see what's wrong.
It's very, very small.

09:17.093 --> 09:20.472
Maybe... I don't know.
No, it's all right. Leave it. Leave it.

09:20.597 --> 09:23.850
- Shall I...
- Yes, you shut it and I'll lock it all.

09:24.350 --> 09:25.727
Thank you.

09:25.852 --> 09:27.270
How are you doing? All right?

09:27.395 --> 09:29.397
Yes, it's a long time since I was in here.

09:29.522 --> 09:31.733
I dare say. There we are.

09:31.941 --> 09:34.360
I haven't been in this car for so long.

09:34.486 --> 09:38.531
Yes, I gather you've been in India
for about two years, sir.

09:38.656 --> 09:41.659
- Yeah, shooting tigers.
- Oh, really? Splendid.

09:42.911 --> 09:44.954
The garage bill, sir.

09:45.079 --> 09:49.542
- Yeah?
- Well, I'm afraid it's £200.

09:49.709 --> 09:52.086
But, of course,
if you insist we can charge it.

09:52.212 --> 09:53.588
No, no. Please, please.

09:53.713 --> 09:56.174
There's a bounty for shooting tigers,
you know?

09:56.299 --> 09:58.301
- Well...
- Yes, it's £50 a head.

09:58.426 --> 10:03.264
- Really? There's no need to pay... I see.
- These are wrapped in bundles of 200.

10:03.389 --> 10:05.223
- Well, there's no need to pay...
- No, that's quite all right.

10:05.348 --> 10:09.602
Yes, you must have shot
an awful lot of tigers, sir.

10:09.727 --> 10:11.771
Yes, I used a machine gun.

10:38.631 --> 10:41.467
<i>Calling Mr Williams. Mr R. J. Williams.</i>

10:42.426 --> 10:44.178
<i>Will Mr Williams please come
to reception...</i>

10:44.303 --> 10:49.058
- Lord Croker. I am expected.
- Yes, Your Lordship. Suite 602.

10:49.183 --> 10:51.227
And there's a message.

10:52.478 --> 10:53.980
Thank you.

11:02.572 --> 11:04.073
Hello, Charlie.

11:06.409 --> 11:09.954
Well, shut the door, Charlie.
You're gonna cause a terrible draught.

11:13.833 --> 11:15.126
Ladies?

11:16.836 --> 11:17.879
Hey, Charlie.

11:18.004 --> 11:19.797
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hi, Charlie.

11:19.922 --> 11:21.674
<i>- Love you, Charlie.
- Ciao, Charlie.</i>

11:21.841 --> 11:23.843
- Nice, Charlie.
- Good to see you, Charlie.

11:23.968 --> 11:25.470
Sweet, Charlie.

11:25.595 --> 11:27.972
Well, I thought, a coming-out present.

11:28.097 --> 11:30.433
Very nice. Very nice.

11:30.558 --> 11:34.729
- Now, what would you like?
- Everything.

12:32.911 --> 12:35.705
- Where's your old man?
- He is dead.

12:36.039 --> 12:41.253
In the Alps, in a car crash.
It wasn't an accident.

12:41.878 --> 12:42.879
Oh!

12:43.797 --> 12:47.134
Well, there goes the job, then.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.972
- Wait, Mr Croker.
- Yes, Mrs Beckerman.

12:52.097 --> 12:54.140
This is for you.

12:55.474 --> 12:59.562
What's this?
Some sort of a consolation prize?

12:59.687 --> 13:02.815
These are all the plans that my husband
didn't have time to complete.

13:02.940 --> 13:06.569
- He wants you to finish them.
- Oh, he does, does he?

13:07.945 --> 13:12.867
Tell me, where do you figure

13:12.992 --> 13:17.454
in the plans your husband
didn't have time to complete?

13:17.913 --> 13:18.956
I don't.

13:19.081 --> 13:22.251
I am going to New York
tomorrow morning at 6:00 a. m.

13:23.627 --> 13:25.254
Pity.

13:27.423 --> 13:32.386
But that still gives us four hours to kill.

13:38.934 --> 13:41.395
And you still in your widow's weeds.

14:04.542 --> 14:07.921
<i>- Charlie Croker, I am dead.
- Hello, Roger.</i>

14:08.046 --> 14:12.258
<i>So I have arranged for my widow to
deliver some material to you in England.</i>

14:12.383 --> 14:13.885
Yes, I got it.

14:14.010 --> 14:17.430
<i>There you must find the backing
to do the job.</i>

14:17.555 --> 14:21.392
<i>You must, Charlie,
because it is a work of genius.</i>

14:24.854 --> 14:27.440
<i>Just think of it.</i>

14:27.565 --> 14:31.694
<i>A city in chaos, a smash-and-grab raid</i>

14:32.403 --> 14:37.116
<i>and $4 million through a traffic jam.</i>

14:39.160 --> 14:40.620
<i>Hmm?</i>

14:41.663 --> 14:43.414
$4 million?

14:45.166 --> 14:50.588
<i>This is the city of Turin,
the industrial capital of Italy,</i>

14:50.713 --> 14:54.759
<i>the most modern in Europe,
famed for its architecture,</i>

14:54.884 --> 14:59.263
<i>and soon, I trust, for
the greatest robbery of the 20th century.</i>

15:01.765 --> 15:05.435
<i>This is the Fiat armoured convoy.</i>

15:05.561 --> 15:08.981
<i>It leaves Turin airport every week.</i>

15:09.439 --> 15:12.943
<i>It never carries less than $4 million.</i>

15:13.068 --> 15:15.070
I think we could
take that over, Roger.

15:15.863 --> 15:18.657
<i>To reach its destination,
the convoy has to travel</i>

15:18.782 --> 15:22.161
<i>through one of the busiest
traffic systems in Europe,</i>

15:22.286 --> 15:25.664
<i>a system which is controlled
by television cameras</i>

15:25.789 --> 15:31.587
<i>and by the computer in this building,
the Turin Traffic Control Centre.</i>

15:32.087 --> 15:35.007
<i>If you can get into this room, Charlie,</i>

15:35.132 --> 15:38.719
<i>you will cause the biggest traffic jam
in the history of the world.</i>

15:38.844 --> 15:41.846
<i>Every street in the city
will be paralysed,</i>

15:41.971 --> 15:45.183
<i>and then you will have a chance
to ambush the convoy.</i>

15:45.308 --> 15:46.642
Very nice.

15:48.269 --> 15:51.981
<i>Now, Charlie,
first you neutralise the TV cameras</i>

15:52.106 --> 15:54.400
<i>which overlook the convoy's route.</i>

15:56.152 --> 16:01.324
<i>You do this
with these little gadgets here. Look.</i>

16:02.700 --> 16:04.785
<i>- Yeah.
- Second,</i>

16:05.828 --> 16:11.959
<i>you break into the computer building
and substitute this new programme.</i>

16:12.502 --> 16:14.670
<i>- Got it.
- And this causes the jam.</i>

16:14.796 --> 16:15.963
Right.

16:16.714 --> 16:23.679
<i>Third, you attack the convoy
in your own inimitable way, Charlie.</i>

16:24.555 --> 16:27.350
<i>And fourth, you escape</i>

16:27.475 --> 16:31.854
<i>on the only route out of the city
which is not blocked up with traffic.</i>

16:32.897 --> 16:36.317
<i>You'll find the details of the route
in this portfolio.</i>

16:37.902 --> 16:40.029
<i>Within just two hours,</i>

16:40.154 --> 16:43.241
<i>you will be over the Alps
and into Switzerland.</i>

16:44.075 --> 16:49.205
<i>And within three, you'll have the money
safe and sound in a Geneva bank.</i>

16:49.831 --> 16:53.459
<i>- Make it work, Charlie.
- I will, Roger.</i>

16:59.757 --> 17:04.262
$4 million through a traffic jam.

17:08.558 --> 17:11.894
Money received from the collection
of Brighton so far is £15,000.

17:16.022 --> 17:17.023
Hello. Camp Freddie?

17:17.150 --> 17:19.484
<i>Charlie Croker.
I thought you were in Italy.</i>

17:19.609 --> 17:23.071
- I want to see Bridger.
- Mr Bridger to you.

17:23.614 --> 17:24.615
I've got a job.

17:24.740 --> 17:28.077
<i>If it's the GPO, City Road,
it's being done next week.</i>

17:28.243 --> 17:33.416
Freddie, this job is bigger than anything
Bridger's done up until now.

17:34.292 --> 17:36.586
If it's the Bank of England, it's out.

17:36.794 --> 17:39.589
Mr Bridger's very worried
about the economy of the country.

17:39.714 --> 17:44.886
Exactly, Freddie.
Now, tell Bridger this is a foreign job

17:45.011 --> 17:47.430
to help with this country's balance
of payments.

17:48.139 --> 17:51.559
Charlie, I don't think
you have the kind of scheme

17:51.684 --> 17:55.103
that yields the size of profit
that Mr Bridger is accustomed to.

17:55.479 --> 17:58.773
But, Freddie, this job is big.

17:59.774 --> 18:04.029
Charlie, you wouldn't even know
how to spell big.

18:05.363 --> 18:07.199
B- I-G. Big.

18:08.950 --> 18:11.912
Now then, Butch Harry,
tell us about Fulham.

18:12.704 --> 18:16.874
Well, now, Fulham,
a bit dodgy at the moment.

18:18.542 --> 18:21.128
How are you?
How do you feel about a little outing?

18:21.253 --> 18:26.258
Now I need Hazel.
Hazel, my lovely, out you come.

18:26.717 --> 18:29.302
Come on, then, for me. There you are.

18:29.761 --> 18:33.640
It's a long time since
you've seen the nightlife, innit, darling?

18:34.766 --> 18:39.187
Wait a minute. Where's my torch?
Where's my bloody torch?

19:21.980 --> 19:24.107
- Good evening, Mr Bridger.
- Croker.

19:24.232 --> 19:29.154
- Mr Bridger, I've got a job lined up.
- Get out of here.

19:29.487 --> 19:33.158
It's all here,
maps, drawings, plans, everything.

19:33.283 --> 19:34.492
You've been put up to this, haven't you?

19:34.617 --> 19:38.621
You've been bribed to upset
my natural rhythm and ruin my health.

19:38.746 --> 19:41.458
No, Mr Bridger.
Mr Bridger, this is important.

19:41.583 --> 19:43.877
$4 million. Europe.

19:44.002 --> 19:47.505
The Common Market.
Italy, the Fiat car factory.

19:47.630 --> 19:52.844
- Croker, this is my toilet.
- Please. Just read it, Mr Bridger.

19:53.470 --> 19:54.846
Get out.

19:54.971 --> 19:58.308
Are you all right, Mr Bridger?
You all right?

20:20.497 --> 20:21.831
He's all right.

20:54.155 --> 20:56.825
I can always take it to the Americans.

20:56.950 --> 21:00.245
They're people
who recognise young talent

21:00.370 --> 21:03.414
and give it a chance, they are.

21:32.859 --> 21:36.779
Last night, Mr Governor,
my toilet was broken into.

21:38.990 --> 21:42.034
- Toilet?
- Toilet.

21:43.494 --> 21:46.622
- Broken into?
- Broken into.

21:48.832 --> 21:51.960
Well, I'm terribly sorry.

21:52.294 --> 21:55.881
There are some places, Governor,
which, to an Englishman, are sacred.

21:56.006 --> 22:00.010
- Well, I've apologised, Bridger.
- And so you should have.

22:00.927 --> 22:03.972
You are not doing your job properly.
Her Majesty's prison is there

22:04.097 --> 22:09.311
not only to keep people from getting out,
but to prevent people from getting in.

22:10.020 --> 22:13.148
You are symptomatic of the lazy,
unimaginative management

22:13.273 --> 22:15.817
which is driving this country
on the rocks!

22:15.942 --> 22:19.988
- Well, is there anything else?
- No, thank you, Governor.

22:23.825 --> 22:28.163
By the way, Mr Bridger,
did you happen to recognise the man

22:28.288 --> 22:31.333
who so rudely interrupted you?

22:31.458 --> 22:33.835
I've never seen him before in my life.

22:39.883 --> 22:42.302
I want Charlie Croker
given a good going-over.

22:42.427 --> 22:44.679
- Yes, Mr Bridger.
- Get the word out to Camp Freddie.

22:44.805 --> 22:46.431
Yes, Mr Bridger.

22:46.556 --> 22:50.268
I don't want him killed.
Just given a good going-over.

22:50.393 --> 22:52.771
I understand exactly what you mean,
Mr Bridger.

22:52.896 --> 22:56.024
Do you, Keats?
That's very imaginative of you.

22:56.233 --> 22:59.778
<i>Sir, I've got you the two volumes
of the Anglo-American Trade,</i>

22:59.903 --> 23:03.198
and UK balance of payments,
1966 and '67.

23:03.490 --> 23:08.829
<i>And I've also brought you
The Illustrated London News, sir.</i>

23:08.954 --> 23:10.247
For why, Keats, for why?

23:10.372 --> 23:14.668
- There's a picture of the queen in it, sir.
- Hmm. That's good of you.

23:17.504 --> 23:19.339
- Sir?
- Keats.

23:19.464 --> 23:22.926
I often wonder whether one day
you're going to top your career

23:23.051 --> 23:25.220
by doing a job on their house.

23:25.345 --> 23:29.683
You must learn, Keats, there are more
things to life than breaking and entering.

23:29.808 --> 23:32.018
Yes, Mr Bridger.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.728
By the way, while we're on the subject,

23:33.854 --> 23:38.525
I notice that some of that young mob
in E Block are not standing to attention

23:38.650 --> 23:41.361
while the national anthem is played
at the end of the nightly TV.

23:41.486 --> 23:44.364
Tell them to do so, otherwise
they will incur my displeasure.

23:44.489 --> 23:47.492
- Yes, Mr Bridger.
- All right, be off with you.

23:47.617 --> 23:49.244
Get that word through to Camp Freddie.

23:49.369 --> 23:50.370
Sir.

24:30.826 --> 24:32.119
Charlie?

24:33.954 --> 24:37.291
- Right then, Fred, come on.
- Wait a minute.

24:43.422 --> 24:48.468
Take all your filthy clothes, too.
This is my man, my territory,

24:48.593 --> 24:50.303
and don't come back!

24:50.887 --> 24:52.722
Charlie's been caught on the job.

24:53.431 --> 24:56.601
Okay, Charlie. All right, where are you?

24:56.976 --> 25:00.396
I know you're in here, Charlie.
There's no use hiding.

25:02.106 --> 25:04.567
Charlie, you had three birds in here.

25:04.692 --> 25:06.528
You didn't seem to mind at the hotel,
did you?

25:06.653 --> 25:08.321
That was your coming-out present.

25:08.446 --> 25:10.573
Yeah, well,
I didn't get a chance to enjoy it.

25:10.698 --> 25:12.283
I didn't get a chance to enjoy it today,
neither.

25:12.408 --> 25:13.910
Coming in here, causing a fracas.

25:14.035 --> 25:16.246
Why don't you even ask me
where I've been, Charlie?

25:16.371 --> 25:17.539
You've been with the law, haven't you?

25:17.664 --> 25:20.083
Yeah, they got me
for taking the ambassador's car,

25:20.208 --> 25:22.585
and they got me
for not even paying the hotel bills.

25:22.710 --> 25:23.711
You deserted me, Charlie.

25:24.963 --> 25:26.965
Don't come here all moody, Lorna.
You know how the game is played.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.425
No, you left me to my fate, Charlie.

25:29.551 --> 25:30.677
Usual one, was it?

25:30.802 --> 25:33.471
Twenty-four hours in a prison.
It was humiliating.

25:33.596 --> 25:35.306
Yeah, well, how did you get out, then?
How did you get out?

25:35.431 --> 25:37.976
Because the ambassador for Pakistan
was a very sweet man.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.477
He was a very sweet man, was he?
Go on.

25:39.602 --> 25:41.604
And the hotel manager was very nice.

25:41.729 --> 25:43.605
Lorna. Lorna, I knew you'd be all right.
I knew you'd be all...

25:43.730 --> 25:46.900
Well, it's no thanks to you,
Charlie Croker, I can tell you that.

25:47.025 --> 25:50.195
- Lorna, I was busy, wasn't I?
- So I see.

25:50.320 --> 25:53.157
So I came in here and saw.
I want you out.

25:54.783 --> 25:56.827
- And if you don't think I mean it...
- I was busy doing some work.

25:56.952 --> 25:58.370
...then you're wrong.

26:01.123 --> 26:06.336
- Charlie, it's the law, Charlie.
- What'd you tell them?

26:06.670 --> 26:10.674
- Charlie, would I tell them anything?
- Of course you would.

26:22.895 --> 26:25.481
- Morning, lads.
- Hello, Croker.

26:25.606 --> 26:27.858
We've come
with Mr Bridger's compliments.

26:27.983 --> 26:29.902
Sorry it's like this, Charlie.

26:32.279 --> 26:34.490
Now, listen, lads...

26:37.451 --> 26:41.371
You wouldn't hit a fellow
with no trousers on, would you?

26:41.497 --> 26:43.373
Okay, then, put them on.

26:49.004 --> 26:50.588
Get away from me!

27:18.241 --> 27:20.910
- Have you seen Croker?
- Yes, Mr Bridger.

27:21.035 --> 27:23.329
Well, I want you to see him again.

27:23.454 --> 27:26.374
I don't think he'll take very kindly to that.

27:26.499 --> 27:31.129
- I'm interested in his scheme.
- But, Mr Bridger...

27:31.254 --> 27:34.924
What you fail to realise is, Freddie,
that we have a new objective.

27:35.049 --> 27:40.054
The Chinese are giving Fiat
$4 million in gold

27:40.179 --> 27:43.850
as a down payment on a car plant
they're constructing near Peking.

27:43.975 --> 27:46.477
- But Croker...
- Croker can handle it.

27:46.602 --> 27:48.271
He's got everything going for him.

27:48.396 --> 27:51.899
There's even a football match in Turin
the day before the delivery.

27:52.024 --> 27:53.901
England versus Italy.

27:54.026 --> 27:55.820
So there'll be enough
English supporters wandering about

27:55.945 --> 27:59.574
to cover his movements,
and even to help him, if required.

28:00.074 --> 28:04.744
There's only one snag.
We need an expert in computers,

28:04.870 --> 28:06.663
someone to look after the technical end.

28:06.788 --> 28:09.291
Well, the top man in the country
is Professor Peach.

28:09.416 --> 28:11.293
I've seen him on television.

28:11.460 --> 28:14.254
- Tell Croker to get him.
- But how?

28:14.379 --> 28:16.256
Maybe the Professor's not bent.

28:16.381 --> 28:21.428
Camp Freddie,
everybody in the world is bent.

28:21.553 --> 28:24.973
Yes, well, my brother's no longer
with us, I'm afraid.

28:26.141 --> 28:27.767
No.

28:29.186 --> 28:34.232
- You mean, he's...
- No, no, no. Nothing like that.

28:35.358 --> 28:38.779
Well, actually, he's in a home.

28:38.904 --> 28:42.699
Yes. Well, we thought it best.
For his own good, you know?

28:43.825 --> 28:46.703
Was it serious, Miss Peach?

28:46.828 --> 28:49.956
- Pam.
- Serious, was it?

28:51.374 --> 28:53.293
- What?
Your brother. In the home.

28:53.418 --> 28:56.338
Yes, I'm afraid
it was quite serious, dear.

28:56.797 --> 28:59.966
- Isn't this greenfly awful?
- Yes.

29:00.091 --> 29:04.805
Yes, well,
not to put a too fine point to it,

29:04.930 --> 29:08.141
he was discovered in the lounge.

29:11.978 --> 29:14.356
- Doing what, Miss Peach?
- Where?

29:14.481 --> 29:18.819
- In the lounge.
- Oh, yes, he was doing it. Yes.

29:19.361 --> 29:20.654
What?

29:20.862 --> 29:21.863
Oh!

29:21.988 --> 29:24.825
Something quite obscene with Annette.

29:30.705 --> 29:34.835
- A net?
- Annette. She was terrified, of course.

29:35.669 --> 29:39.420
- Naturally.
- Yes, well. Would you like some tea?

29:41.214 --> 29:43.383
Tea. Would you like some?

29:43.800 --> 29:46.427
- You're very kind. Yes, please.
- Good.

29:46.553 --> 29:48.513
Excuse me a minute.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.183
Annette?

29:52.308 --> 29:55.937
Annette, would you like to serve tea
in the lounge, dear?

29:58.565 --> 30:02.402
Oh, I shouldn't let her do that, dear.
That gives them ideas.

30:08.032 --> 30:10.326
This is Annette.

30:12.745 --> 30:16.124
Professor Peach,
do you see what I'm getting at?

30:16.249 --> 30:20.295
Hmm. Your brawn, my brain.
I'm not stupid, you know.

30:21.629 --> 30:25.592
It's cooperation, isn't it?
Like that flagpole out there.

30:26.342 --> 30:28.887
- Flagpole?
- The flagpole in the yard.

30:29.095 --> 30:33.725
I mean, I know
if there was a convex mirror up there,

30:33.850 --> 30:37.604
27 degrees vertical,
42 degrees horizontal,

30:37.729 --> 30:40.523
I could see
straight into Matron's bedroom.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.735
Of course, somebody else
would have to be up the pole to fix it.

30:43.860 --> 30:45.570
I couldn't do it meself.

30:45.695 --> 30:48.656
It's cooperation, you see?
She's a big woman, you know?

30:48.782 --> 30:52.243
Here, wait till you see them Italian birds.

30:52.368 --> 30:55.246
- Are they big? I like them big.
- They're enormous.

30:55.371 --> 30:58.208
- Really?
- Very, very, very big.

30:58.333 --> 31:01.377
Would we wear stockings
over our heads?

31:01.586 --> 31:04.547
- No need for you to.
- I'd like that.

31:05.173 --> 31:07.884
I could steal one of Matron's, couldn't I?

31:08.009 --> 31:10.386
We'll have you out of here in no time.

31:10.512 --> 31:12.764
Of course, I wouldn't want
to get Matron into trouble.

31:12.889 --> 31:16.558
Not that way, anyway. She's big. Big.

31:17.392 --> 31:18.727
Look out the window, Professor.

31:18.852 --> 31:20.729
- Do what?
- Look out the window at my car.

31:20.854 --> 31:22.439
- Come on.
- Car?

31:22.564 --> 31:24.108
- What car?
- Down there.

31:36.495 --> 31:40.874
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Please, gentlemen. Please.

31:42.126 --> 31:46.547
We are about to do a job in Italy,

31:46.672 --> 31:48.298
and I would like to introduce you all
to each other.

31:48.333 --> 31:49.925
And I would like to introduce you all
to each other.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.929
First, Bill Bailey.
He'll be my number two.

31:54.054 --> 31:57.933
Now, you all know Bill.
He's just done three years in Parkhurst.

31:58.058 --> 32:01.270
He's as honest as the day is long,
and you can trust him.

32:01.395 --> 32:05.399
Second, the getaway.
This will be done in three Mini Coopers.

32:05.524 --> 32:10.529
And they will be driven by Chris,
Tony and Dominic.

32:10.654 --> 32:11.947
Hello, chaps.

32:12.072 --> 32:13.282
- Hello.
- Hello.

32:13.407 --> 32:15.284
All right, all right, all right, all right.

32:15.409 --> 32:17.161
These chinless wonders
will get you out of Turin

32:17.286 --> 32:19.955
faster than anyone else on four wheels.

32:20.664 --> 32:22.166
Remember that.

32:22.583 --> 32:26.127
When we get to the Alps,
we will transfer to a coach.

32:26.252 --> 32:29.422
The coach will be driven
by William here,

32:29.547 --> 32:33.634
better known as Big William,
for very obvious reasons.

32:33.759 --> 32:37.388
Now we come to the professor here.

32:37.513 --> 32:42.477
The professor is in charge of all matters
relating to the Turin computer.

32:42.935 --> 32:47.148
So I don't want anyone putting him down
because he's a man of reading.

32:47.273 --> 32:52.945
I know he's got some very funny habits,
but make him feel at home.

32:53.070 --> 32:55.782
He's very important to the operation.

32:55.907 --> 33:01.204
Finally, and very quickly, I would like
to introduce you to all the lads

33:01.370 --> 33:03.247
who are going to do the job with me.

33:03.372 --> 33:10.254
Arthur, Frank, Rozzer, Coco, Yellow,

33:11.714 --> 33:14.258
Camp Freddie you all know.

33:16.219 --> 33:20.765
Roger, Dave and Lorna
will be in reserve with three fast cars

33:20.890 --> 33:22.725
in case anything goes wrong.

33:22.850 --> 33:23.935
Right?

33:24.060 --> 33:27.021
Now, it's a very difficult job

33:27.146 --> 33:32.526
and the only way to get through it is,
we all work together as a team.

33:32.651 --> 33:36.363
And that means you do everything I say.

33:40.492 --> 33:42.119
Here's Charlie.

33:43.745 --> 33:45.080
Charlie.

33:50.585 --> 33:52.379
Putting the jib on.

33:52.921 --> 33:54.339
Well,
don't just stand there doing nothing.

33:54.464 --> 33:56.174
- Get on with something.
- I am, Charlie. I'm seeing...

33:56.299 --> 33:58.051
Well, get on with it, then.

33:58.552 --> 33:59.553
Rozzer?

33:59.678 --> 34:01.096
Rozzer's having trouble
with his differential there.

34:01.221 --> 34:03.640
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Hurry up.

34:06.309 --> 34:07.978
Dippers for the Continent.
Just changing the...

34:08.103 --> 34:09.103
- The other way round.
- Right.

34:09.228 --> 34:10.938
- Are they quartz-iodide?
- Yeah, that's right, governor.

34:11.063 --> 34:12.399
All right.

34:12.899 --> 34:15.819
We couldn't afford the gold yet,
so we're using lead, Charlie.

34:15.944 --> 34:17.737
Will it take the weight?

34:18.155 --> 34:19.864
- Take the weight.
- Yeah, all right, Charlie.

34:19.989 --> 34:22.826
- Will it take the weight?
- Yeah, yeah, it's all right, Charlie.

34:22.951 --> 34:24.786
Mind your face, Charles.

34:24.911 --> 34:28.248
- How you doing? All right?
- Okay, but I don't like the colour.

34:28.373 --> 34:31.917
It's beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Carry on.

34:33.878 --> 34:35.087
Lorna!

34:40.842 --> 34:43.637
Does he really need all this equipment?

34:43.762 --> 34:45.139
He says he does.

34:59.779 --> 35:00.780
No.

35:01.739 --> 35:04.033
You're meant to use your brakes, Chris.

35:04.742 --> 35:06.410
Terribly sorry, Charles.

35:06.952 --> 35:10.581
- How many cars have we got left, Bill?
- A couple, Charlie.

35:10.790 --> 35:13.958
Send the next one up.
Let's hope he gets it right.

35:32.977 --> 35:35.563
What do you mean they're written off?

35:35.688 --> 35:39.609
A series of accidents, Mr Bridger.
I promise there'll be no more.

35:40.318 --> 35:45.490
Five, four, three,

35:45.615 --> 35:49.369
two, one, go.

36:01.005 --> 36:04.175
You're only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off.

36:28.199 --> 36:31.327
How's your new house, Fred?

36:31.453 --> 36:34.456
Very nice, Mr Bridger, thank you.
Very nice.

36:35.999 --> 36:37.333
My pleasure.

37:01.816 --> 37:04.402
<i>Beckerman's done his homework
very well.</i>

37:04.527 --> 37:07.989
<i>The getaway is possible, but not easy.</i>

37:08.114 --> 37:11.743
<i>For a start, the attack has to be made
in this square</i>

37:13.077 --> 37:17.081
<i>and it must be completed
inside of three minutes.</i>

37:17.207 --> 37:19.584
<i>Apart from knocking over
a few old dears with their carrycots,</i>

37:19.709 --> 37:20.710
<i>I think we can manage it.</i>

37:21.294 --> 37:24.339
Now, you all understand
what you've got to do.

37:24.464 --> 37:26.508
Okay? Now, Bill.

37:29.885 --> 37:30.886
Uh...

37:31.011 --> 37:34.932
Oh, yeah, the transporters
will move in here and here,

37:35.057 --> 37:39.353
- and they'll block off the main drag.
- Right. Roger.

37:40.437 --> 37:42.898
Arthur and Lorna park
the three fast cars here

37:43.023 --> 37:45.484
in case anything goes wrong and
we gotta make a quick getaway, right?

37:45.609 --> 37:48.152
Correct. Now, it's 12:10.

37:48.277 --> 37:50.780
The bullion van
will be entering the piazza

37:50.905 --> 37:54.033
and will be forced slowly
towards the centre.

37:55.326 --> 37:58.746
<i>It's the old over-and-under routine.</i>

37:58.871 --> 38:02.374
<i>First we go over the traffic
and through the museums</i>

38:04.334 --> 38:08.213
<i>and then under again
and up into this church.</i>

38:10.090 --> 38:11.716
<i>The difficulty is here.</i>

38:12.968 --> 38:16.972
<i>If the police can get a car
onto that bridge</i>

38:17.097 --> 38:21.601
<i>before we've got across it,
we're done for,</i>

38:22.602 --> 38:25.355
<i>but it's a gamble we've got to take.</i>

38:41.329 --> 38:46.126
Now, the bullion wagon is here.
Right? Dominic.

38:46.251 --> 38:48.920
We get into the Minis behind the piazza.

38:49.045 --> 38:50.380
Right. Arthur.

38:50.505 --> 38:53.675
We drive the Land Rover
into the square.

38:53.800 --> 38:58.180
- Piazza, Arthur. Piazza.
- Sorry, Charlie. Piazza.

38:58.305 --> 39:03.101
- Now, the Land Rover is in the piazza.
- And we come in right behind target.

39:03.226 --> 39:04.936
That's it. Wallop.

39:05.771 --> 39:08.106
<i>But since the bridge
will be blocked by traffic,</i>

39:08.231 --> 39:12.235
<i>the only possible way out
is across the weir,</i>

39:12.360 --> 39:14.780
<i>which runs along
by the side of the bridge.</i>

39:16.823 --> 39:19.951
<i>I've only one comment to make
about that, Mr Bridger.</i>

39:21.495 --> 39:23.121
<i>Good luck.</i>

39:44.351 --> 39:49.147
Keats,
I think we'd better arrange a funeral.

40:13.004 --> 40:15.674
- All ready to go, Croker?
- Yes, Mr Bridger.

40:15.799 --> 40:18.009
The plans have been worked out
to the last detail?

40:18.135 --> 40:19.845
Yes, Mr Bridger.

40:19.970 --> 40:22.806
- Everything taken care of?
- Yes, Mr Bridger.

40:22.931 --> 40:25.934
Well, Croker,
you've overlooked one thing.

40:26.059 --> 40:29.062
The Mafia. They'll be waiting for you.

40:33.233 --> 40:36.695
In every shot of Camp
Freddie's film there's a Mafia man.

40:36.820 --> 40:40.031
If they were on to Beckerman,
they'll be on to us.

40:40.157 --> 40:42.325
You're not
thinking of calling it off?

40:42.451 --> 40:44.870
As long as you know
what you're taking on, Croker.

40:44.995 --> 40:49.623
- Yes, the Mafia.
- Yes, the Mafia.

40:51.834 --> 40:56.881
Croker, you are about to take
a half a ton of gold,

40:57.006 --> 40:58.591
in broad daylight,
from under their noses.

40:58.716 --> 41:01.968
They won't take kindly to that.
That's why they killed Beckerman.

41:02.093 --> 41:07.599
- It's a question of prestige, is it?
- Yes, Croker, it's a question of prestige.

41:07.724 --> 41:10.018
If you go through with this,
you've got to win.

41:10.143 --> 41:13.313
If you muck it up,
don't ever think of coming back here,

41:13.438 --> 41:15.273
except in your coffin.

41:22.446 --> 41:24.156
We're ready
now to start the service.

41:32.623 --> 41:34.583
Who's that lot over there?

41:35.459 --> 41:36.835
The drivers.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.880
They're the lot
that smashed up my cars.

41:40.547 --> 41:43.091
Practise makes perfect, Mr Bridger.

41:43.258 --> 41:44.927
You pick them, don't you?

41:48.138 --> 41:51.141
- Mr Bridger will now say a few words.
- What?

41:51.266 --> 41:52.935
Your speech, sir.

42:04.822 --> 42:10.285
We have come here to pay our respects
to Great Aunt Nellie.

42:10.661 --> 42:14.081
She brought us up properly
and taught us loyalty.

42:14.790 --> 42:18.293
I want you to remember that
during these next few days.

42:19.378 --> 42:22.464
I also want you to remember

42:22.589 --> 42:25.717
that if you don't come back
with the goods,

42:25.843 --> 42:28.846
Nellie here will turn in her grave

42:28.971 --> 42:30.931
and, likely as not,

42:31.056 --> 42:33.976
jump right out of it
and kick your teeth in.

43:10.220 --> 43:13.807
Dave, take the valley road to Turin,
okay?

43:13.932 --> 43:15.267
Go.

43:15.392 --> 43:18.145
You three take the Minis
along the B road

43:18.270 --> 43:19.772
and keep the speed down, okay?

43:19.897 --> 43:22.649
Right, there you go.
Go on, away you go.

43:22.775 --> 43:24.610
Freddie, stay with the bus.

43:24.735 --> 43:26.987
Big William,
take the bus along the main road.

43:27.112 --> 43:28.822
Go. Go.

43:29.573 --> 43:32.576
You lot, stay with me.
We're going out the mountain route.

43:32.701 --> 43:34.745
Where's Peach?

43:34.870 --> 43:38.498
Hey, what do you think this is?
A Sunday school outing?

43:39.165 --> 43:42.168
Pity people aren't as lovely as flowers,
isn't it?

43:43.252 --> 43:45.505
Take your flowers and get in the car.
Come on.

43:46.547 --> 43:47.715
Hurry up.

44:44.729 --> 44:48.442
- Mr Croker?
- That's right.

44:50.527 --> 44:56.783
Six weeks ago, a friend of yours
met with an accident on this very road.

44:56.950 --> 45:02.122
- So?
- Do you mind if I show you how?

45:03.457 --> 45:04.458
No.

45:37.823 --> 45:42.912
- You just lost him his insurance bonus.
- It cost Beckerman his life.

45:44.079 --> 45:47.583
Listen, the gold arrives tomorrow,

45:47.708 --> 45:52.838
and you think you can pick it up like a
bunch of groceries in the supermarket?

45:54.423 --> 45:57.301
Just how are you going to do it?

45:58.511 --> 45:59.845
Excuse me.

46:11.565 --> 46:17.321
Does Mr Bridger think he can
take over Europe from a prison cell?

46:18.823 --> 46:19.824
Huh?

46:21.158 --> 46:22.451
Your car?

46:26.830 --> 46:27.956
Yeah.

46:41.010 --> 46:42.262
Pretty car.

46:56.025 --> 46:57.485
Paid for?

47:34.730 --> 47:36.565
Very funny.

47:46.450 --> 47:47.451
Hey!

47:56.043 --> 47:59.254
You'll be making a grave error
if you kill us.

48:00.214 --> 48:03.425
There are a quarter of a million Italians
in Britain,

48:03.550 --> 48:06.553
and they'll be made to suffer.

48:06.678 --> 48:11.141
Every restaurant, café,
ice-cream parlour,

48:11.266 --> 48:13.644
gambling den and nightclub

48:13.769 --> 48:19.274
in London, Liverpool and Glasgow,
will be smashed.

48:21.527 --> 48:25.948
Mr Bridger will drive them into the sea.

48:36.208 --> 48:40.838
Well, gentlemen,
it's a long walk back to England,

48:41.296 --> 48:43.340
and it's that way.

48:44.508 --> 48:45.968
Good morning.

49:09.616 --> 49:11.992
May I salute our American cousins,

49:12.117 --> 49:15.328
<i>Signor Francesco Cosca
and his lovely wife?</i>

49:16.580 --> 49:18.039
And may I raise my glass

49:18.165 --> 49:22.377
<i>to Signor Altabani
and his most beautiful wife</i>

49:22.502 --> 49:24.713
to thank him for his hospitality?

49:25.714 --> 49:31.178
And to congratulate him on the way he
handled the English mob this morning.

49:33.388 --> 49:36.016
I would not be too sure
about the English, cousin.

49:36.141 --> 49:37.893
They wouldn't dare.

49:42.355 --> 49:45.358
They are not so stupid as they look.

50:51.215 --> 50:52.925
Candles. Quickly.

52:19.469 --> 52:22.222
Gentlemen,
we must assume they are here.

53:11.937 --> 53:13.105
<i>All passengers</i>

53:13.230 --> 53:16.150
<i>proceed to gate number five
for departure.</i>

53:16.275 --> 53:17.401
<i>Thank you.</i>

53:22.739 --> 53:25.033
- Got your passport?
- I don't know. I think so.

53:25.159 --> 53:27.453
Well, you need your passport
directly after the tickets. Understand?

53:27.578 --> 53:31.373
Now, as you walk out to the plane,
look neither to the right nor to the left.

53:31.498 --> 53:35.127
Just look straight ahead, okay?
Just keep going straight ahead.

53:35.252 --> 53:36.336
Geneva, please.

53:36.462 --> 53:40.090
You all right? You got it?
Neither to the right nor to the left.

53:40.215 --> 53:43.594
- Left, straight ahead.
- Look straight ahead and keep going.

53:57.441 --> 54:00.569
Charlie, listen.
The plan was that we stay here.

54:00.694 --> 54:02.279
The plan's changed.

54:02.404 --> 54:05.990
- But why, Charlie, why?
- Because you're a liability.

54:28.137 --> 54:32.350
Lorna, you see that lot out there?

54:34.185 --> 54:37.271
If we slip up, they'll tear us apart.

54:40.900 --> 54:44.779
And I don't want you involved any more.

54:48.198 --> 54:49.908
- Charlie?
- What?

54:50.492 --> 54:52.035
You care?

54:52.369 --> 54:57.666
Get on the plane. I'll see you in Geneva,

54:58.959 --> 55:01.086
and have a cup of tea ready.

55:06.341 --> 55:07.968
Bye-bye, Charlie.

55:08.844 --> 55:11.596
Get on the plane. Get on the plane.

55:12.097 --> 55:14.182
I love you, Charlie.

55:51.595 --> 55:54.931
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, lads.

55:55.056 --> 55:57.517
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Chris.

55:57.642 --> 56:00.061
- Before we leave, Bill?
- Yes, Charles?

56:00.187 --> 56:02.022
I want every one of those tins burned.

56:02.147 --> 56:04.733
I don't want any fingerprints
on anything in the house.

56:04.858 --> 56:07.611
- We're all wearing our gloves, Charlie.
- Yeah, but you can't be too careful.

56:07.736 --> 56:10.781
- Is there a toilet here?
- If you can call it that. It's out the back.

56:10.906 --> 56:12.991
Yeah, well,
wash the handle and the seat.

56:13.116 --> 56:15.744
I don't want any prints on that, either.

56:15.869 --> 56:20.165
Right, here is the crunch.

56:21.625 --> 56:22.709
Do you all know how to get there?

56:22.834 --> 56:25.504
Actually, we can
all read maps, Charles.

56:25.629 --> 56:30.133
The map will be in your head, Chris.
I'm burning this one. Any questions?

56:30.258 --> 56:34.012
Now we've lost the two Jags
and the Aston,

56:34.137 --> 56:36.098
what happens if anything
does go wrong?

56:36.223 --> 56:37.933
Put your gloves on.

56:39.101 --> 56:40.268
Anything else?

56:40.393 --> 56:44.064
- Shall we synchronise our watches?
- Nuts to your watches.

56:44.189 --> 56:48.944
You just be there by quarter to and
don't get stuck in the traffic jam neither.

56:49.611 --> 56:51.154
Anything else?

56:52.114 --> 56:53.740
Right, away you go.

56:53.990 --> 56:54.991
Oh!

56:55.409 --> 56:59.787
One more thing. Just remember this,

56:59.912 --> 57:03.457
in this country
they drive on the wrong side of the road.

57:16.512 --> 57:18.639
- Bill?
- Yes, Charlie?

57:19.222 --> 57:21.391
- Bill?
- Yes, Charlie?

57:21.516 --> 57:24.561
- Burn this for me, will you?
- Yes, Charlie.

57:26.855 --> 57:29.566
- Bill?
- Yes, Charlie?

57:29.691 --> 57:32.819
- Get rid of this lot.
- Yes, Charlie.

58:25.412 --> 58:27.539
They're in a trattoria in the city.

58:27.664 --> 58:28.874
They know where to put these, do they?

58:28.999 --> 58:32.878
Yes, you can see the cameras
on the rooftops.

59:19.299 --> 59:21.301
- I can't argue...
- I am going in the front.

59:21.427 --> 59:23.429
You are going in the back.

59:23.554 --> 59:25.889
He says he wants to sit up in front
with the driver.

59:26.014 --> 59:27.099
I always get sick in the back.

59:27.224 --> 59:30.394
Listen, if I go in the back I'll get
me migraine, I'll be out like a light.

59:30.519 --> 59:34.940
You... You are not gonna be sick.
You're not gonna have your migraine,

59:35.065 --> 59:37.776
and everybody is gonna sit
in the back of the motor.

59:37.901 --> 59:41.238
Charlie, me in the back of the motor,
with my asthma?

59:47.619 --> 59:51.457
One more word out of you, Arthur...
All right?

59:52.750 --> 59:58.005
All right. Right.
Now, everybody, all your gear in here.

59:58.130 --> 59:59.256
Come on, get your gear out.

01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:03.302
Pens, wallets, passports,
photographs of your girlfriend.

01:00:03.427 --> 01:00:05.387
I want those cards, as well.
Put them in here.

01:00:05.512 --> 01:00:07.639
But I'm going to need these cards,
Charlie.

01:00:07.765 --> 01:00:09.808
What do you mean you're gonna
need the... Put them in here!

01:00:09.933 --> 01:00:13.604
I want mascots, money, bottle openers.

01:00:13.729 --> 01:00:15.773
<i>...in London I was...
- Arthur!</i>

01:00:15.898 --> 01:00:19.318
...and the game was up.
All I had to do, all the time...

01:00:19.443 --> 01:00:20.611
What?

01:00:23.488 --> 01:00:27.492
- I'm getting in a contact, Charlie.
- Let's hear it. Turn it up.

01:00:27.617 --> 01:00:29.160
I'll turn it up.

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:38.919
- How about that?
- How about what?

01:00:41.088 --> 01:00:44.674
- How about what?
- They've finished loading the gold.

01:00:46.384 --> 01:00:48.470
Right, get dressed.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.392
Right, away you go.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.024
Away you go.

01:02:33.949 --> 01:02:35.409
<i>Molto bene, Dad.</i>

01:02:52.176 --> 01:02:53.636
Okay, let's go.

01:03:37.011 --> 01:03:40.098
Can you direct me
to Corso Garibaldi Street?

01:03:48.231 --> 01:03:50.024
Bloody foreigners.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.653
Excuse me.

01:04:10.669 --> 01:04:13.547
Blimey. Bloody Grand Prix.

01:06:03.739 --> 01:06:06.324
- What the devil is happening?
- It's another traffic jam.

01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:09.494
- It gets worse every time.
- We've lost the convoy.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.689
Any minute now.

01:08:45.814 --> 01:08:48.067
It's like the Black Hole of Calcutta
in here.

01:08:48.192 --> 01:08:49.734
Shut it, Arthur.

01:08:51.028 --> 01:08:53.988
- What are they gabbling about, Franco?
- Complaining about the traffic jam.

01:08:54.113 --> 01:08:56.158
Yeah? They'll have something else
to complain about in a minute.

01:09:11.215 --> 01:09:13.341
- Keep calm.
- Get off my feet, will you?

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:17.554
All right! All right! All right!

01:09:18.596 --> 01:09:21.767
Get yourselves sorted out and shut up!

01:09:21.892 --> 01:09:24.478
No one talks any more, except me.

01:09:38.492 --> 01:09:41.953
Now! Now! Now! Now! Get in front of it!

01:09:56.135 --> 01:09:58.220
Right, put your helmets on.

01:10:50.605 --> 01:10:52.023
Hold tight.

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:57.278
Now. Go. Go round. Get in front of it!

01:11:25.765 --> 01:11:28.851
Put that bloody water cannon out.

01:11:53.291 --> 01:11:54.835
Okay, Bill.

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:38.711
In you come. In you come.

01:12:40.755 --> 01:12:42.214
Back! Back! Back!

01:12:42.339 --> 01:12:45.718
Hey! Unload! Unload! Unload!

01:14:00.708 --> 01:14:02.293
Where do you think you're going?
Don't just stand there!

01:14:02.419 --> 01:14:03.711
Get on with it! Get on with it!

01:14:04.587 --> 01:14:07.048
Get in the car. Just get back up there.
Get back up there.

01:14:07.173 --> 01:14:09.801
If anybody comes through there,
hit them.

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.429
Get up there. Right.

01:14:42.875 --> 01:14:44.668
Okay, Charlie, that's it.

01:14:44.793 --> 01:14:47.212
Right. You, you, you in the Dormobile.

01:14:47.337 --> 01:14:48.589
Get in the car.

01:14:49.089 --> 01:14:50.841
Get in the Dormobile.

01:15:00.726 --> 01:15:02.269
Charlie, get your finger out, will you?

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.860
Come on, let's go. Get a move on, then!

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.742
Well, look happy, you stupid bastards.

01:15:58.867 --> 01:16:00.661
We won, didn't we?

01:16:07.042 --> 01:16:08.085
They went thataway.

01:16:38.656 --> 01:16:39.782
I could eat a horse.

01:18:48.993 --> 01:18:50.286
Good luck.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:30.128
Try putting your foot down, Tony.
They're really getting rather close.

01:22:57.279 --> 01:22:58.363
Look out, look out, look out, look out.

01:22:58.488 --> 01:22:59.614
It's Charlie. It's Charlie. It's Charlie.

01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:02.826
Now, as you go around,
look for that bloody exit.

01:23:02.951 --> 01:23:04.369
We can't go round here all night.

01:23:28.142 --> 01:23:29.351
- Manzo?
- Yes, sir.

01:23:29.477 --> 01:23:31.937
Check the railway station, all trains.

01:23:32.063 --> 01:23:34.023
Check all names of passengers

01:23:34.148 --> 01:23:37.068
who boarded aeroplanes
at Linate or Malpensa.

01:23:37.193 --> 01:23:38.861
This was a big operation.

01:23:38.986 --> 01:23:42.490
Those who were engaged in the earlier
part will already have left the town,

01:23:42.615 --> 01:23:43.783
- probably by air.
- Yes, sir.

01:23:43.908 --> 01:23:46.327
- Check the autostradas.
- But the police will be doing this.

01:23:46.452 --> 01:23:49.163
We know who they are, the police don't.
Also, have my plane made ready.

01:23:49.288 --> 01:23:50.956
- Yes, sir.
- They can't get out.

01:23:51.082 --> 01:23:52.416
Nothing can move in this mess.

01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:55.252
If they planned this jam,
they must have planned a way out.

01:24:09.058 --> 01:24:11.435
I think you might make an effort
to keep up with the others, Tony.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.561
All right. All right.

01:24:14.313 --> 01:24:16.065
Here, make a wish.

01:24:20.069 --> 01:24:21.112
Look out. They're behind us.

01:24:21.237 --> 01:24:23.279
You better put your foot down,
we'll lose them easy.

01:26:27.403 --> 01:26:28.821
Hurry up, Dominic.

01:27:10.611 --> 01:27:12.113
Let's go.

01:27:14.115 --> 01:27:16.534
Have you heard the news, sir?
They've done it, Mr Bridger.

01:27:16.659 --> 01:27:19.662
All the men are yelling for you, sir.
They've done it.

01:27:19.787 --> 01:27:22.248
- Done what, Keats?
- The job, sir.

01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:43.936
England!

01:27:46.355 --> 01:27:47.982
England!

01:27:50.526 --> 01:27:52.153
England!

01:27:54.363 --> 01:27:55.990
England!

01:28:45.746 --> 01:28:48.791
Get the wheels in line.
Get the wheels in line with it,

01:28:48.916 --> 01:28:51.127
and then slam your brakes,
or we'll be in the cabin.

01:28:56.757 --> 01:28:59.635
You should've used more speed
on the up, accelerate and...

01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:07.727
England!

01:29:10.271 --> 01:29:11.897
England!

01:29:24.076 --> 01:29:25.077
That's it. Go on now.

01:29:27.705 --> 01:29:29.331
England!

01:29:31.292 --> 01:29:32.835
England!

01:29:42.428 --> 01:29:43.429
Okay, hang on.

01:29:54.147 --> 01:29:55.815
- Be very careful.
- Okay.

01:29:59.903 --> 01:30:01.529
England!

01:30:04.074 --> 01:30:06.826
Right, everybody out.
Start unloading the gold.

01:30:26.137 --> 01:30:27.764
England!

01:30:45.198 --> 01:30:46.866
England!

01:31:03.924 --> 01:31:05.384
England!

01:31:31.368 --> 01:31:32.536
Charlie boy?

01:31:38.208 --> 01:31:39.209
Now!

01:31:56.602 --> 01:31:58.103
Ready, Charlie?

01:32:03.692 --> 01:32:04.735
Now!

01:32:31.094 --> 01:32:32.095
Ready?

01:32:35.473 --> 01:32:36.474
Now!

01:33:03.918 --> 01:33:06.879
Okay, out. Out you come.
Out you come.

01:33:07.004 --> 01:33:10.173
Leave the beer. Leave the beer. Get in.

01:33:11.425 --> 01:33:12.843
Come on.

01:33:14.177 --> 01:33:15.846
Okay, William, go!

01:34:11.734 --> 01:34:13.235
Ooh!

01:34:39.428 --> 01:34:41.180
Hold still.
Hold still. Hold still. Hold still.

01:34:45.267 --> 01:34:46.685
Nobody move.

01:35:00.032 --> 01:35:03.577
We're balancing right on the edge.

01:35:03.703 --> 01:35:07.498
Very slowly, move this way.

01:35:08.958 --> 01:35:11.669
Very slowly.
Don't make a sharp movement.

01:35:12.795 --> 01:35:15.589
Come as far up this end as you can get.

01:35:37.903 --> 01:35:41.073
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it, Bill.

01:35:50.499 --> 01:35:54.712
The gold is pulling it over the edge.
We'll have to get it back.

01:36:16.024 --> 01:36:17.776
Get back! Get back!

01:36:24.782 --> 01:36:28.327
Now hold still. Don't move.
Don't move at all.

01:36:32.915 --> 01:36:37.878
Don't no one get out the door, neither.
Otherwise we'll all go.

01:36:59.190 --> 01:37:03.027
Edge back as far as you can go

01:37:03.152 --> 01:37:07.198
to counterbalance me. Now...

01:38:00.001 --> 01:38:06.007
Hang on a minute, lads.
I've got a great idea.
