Can you just let it go?
Fitz: Let it go?

No! I can't.
Well,
I'm not talking about it.

because you want him here!

00:20.521 --> 00:23.022
You have a wife.
You don't get to be jealous.

00:23.024 --> 00:25.157
I am not jealous.
I am aware.

There's a fox
in my henhouse.

Did you just say henhouse?
It's a metaphor.

what this is about?

00:42.143 --> 00:43.175
Jake is not your father.

Who you made an enemy of!

00:44.478 --> 00:45.744
Your father had to go,

And I needed
someone who was on my side!

to be disloyal to me.

you were doing it for me.

I did not do this for you.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.630
I did this for me.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.365
So I could work
on the campaign.

01:40.367 --> 01:44.103
So I could walk down the street
and not be whispered about!

01:44.105 --> 01:46.238
So I could stop being known

01:46.240 --> 01:48.173
As the woman who screwed
the president!

01:48.175 --> 01:50.776
So the scarlet "a" on my chest
could be invisible!

01:50.778 --> 01:52.845
So I'm not a joke!

01:52.847 --> 01:56.615
I am not a hen.
I am not a prize.

a presidential election,

a presidential election

I did think about it.

No, she's right. I am.

about andrew's drug use, then --

It means the story
isn't coming from leo.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.878
B613 will destroy you.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.582
You can't do this.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.850
I can help you.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.818
No.

19:47.820 --> 19:51.422
I'm helping myself.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.292
Now get out of my car.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.293
I'm not leaving.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.827
Get out.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.498
Or I'll shoot you.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.635
I'm violent now.
Or hadn't you heard?

20:04.637 --> 20:05.903
Quinn, come on.

20:05.905 --> 20:10.274
Get out of my car,
or I'll shoot you!

20:40.706 --> 20:42.006
What?

20:42.008 --> 20:44.008
[ door closes ]
hello to you, too.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.676
You called me.
You said it was important.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.978
You told me to come home early.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.879
I used my official
"boyfriend of olivia pope" key.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.816
And now I'm here.
So what?

20:51.818 --> 20:53.884
How many agents
do you have under you?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.753
[ sighs ]
that's classified.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.321
200? 2,000?

20:57.323 --> 20:58.689
Guessing won't make it
any less classified.

20:58.691 --> 21:02.660
I ask you to watch my father,
see what he's up to,

21:02.662 --> 21:06.330
One of your unknown number
of agents on it,

21:06.332 --> 21:07.732
You assign quinn perkins?

21:07.734 --> 21:08.866
I didn't.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.901
I saw her
staking him out.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.803
After I specifically
asked you not --

21:12.805 --> 21:14.305
You think I'm an idiot?
That depends.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.640
Did you put quinn
on my father?

21:15.642 --> 21:16.941
No. I didn't.
But let me be clear.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.677
You can ask a favor of me.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.979
But you cannot tell me
how to do it, who to task,

21:21.981 --> 21:23.814
Or anything remotely close
to how to do my job

21:23.816 --> 21:26.350
Because you have no idea
how my world works,

21:26.352 --> 21:28.319
The responsibilities I have

21:28.321 --> 21:29.920
Outside of the little errands
you hand me

21:29.922 --> 21:32.657
Or keeping an eye
on your father.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.925
Jake.
And one more thing.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.460
What?

21:36.462 --> 21:41.399
Stock...Your damn...Fridge.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.734
If I'm gonna be
your fake boyfriend all day,

21:43.736 --> 21:44.869
I'm gonna come home
at the end of it

21:44.871 --> 21:48.005
And drink real beer
and eat real food.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.640
Wine is not beer,

21:49.642 --> 21:53.711
And popcorn
is most definitely not food.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.681
What are you doing?
[ sighs ]

21:56.683 --> 21:58.582
I'm gonna take a shower.

21:58.584 --> 22:02.887
And I want to wash it off me
before we have pretend sex.

I'd like to make a donation.

Hollis.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.755
Picked out which cousin you want
for energy chief?

22:37.757 --> 22:39.724
Nah, them boys are all dumber
than a trailer hitch.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.125
But there's a nephew
or two...

22:41.127 --> 22:42.927
Say, our campaign treasurer
tells me

22:42.929 --> 22:45.529
That that check we talked about
hasn't come in yet.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.531
Oh, well,
arrangements got to be made.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.133
Assets moved
from there to yonder.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.402
I got a couple of you sharp
jewish fellas

22:51.404 --> 22:53.037
And a damn sight clever asian
do all that for me.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.072
Just making sure
you're still on board.

22:55.074 --> 22:58.042
I know sally wasn't
100% on her game when we met.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.111
Oh, don't you worry 'bout me.
I'm just like an ol' hound dog.

23:00.113 --> 23:01.679
I got to circle around
a spell

23:01.681 --> 23:03.080
Before settin' down
and settlin' in.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.782
I'll be in touch.

23:06.585 --> 23:09.019
So...

23:09.021 --> 23:10.621
We can count on you?

23:10.623 --> 23:13.758
I could hand-pick me
the next secretary of energy.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.126
Not if they don't win.

23:15.128 --> 23:16.727
You wouldn't be countin'
your chickens,

23:16.729 --> 23:17.995
Now, would you, cy?

23:17.997 --> 23:20.698
Well, now, there's seein',
and there's doin'.

23:20.700 --> 23:24.068
So, we can expect you
at the donor dinner tonight?

23:24.070 --> 23:27.405
For a chute seat
at a texas rodeo.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.842
Into david rosen's
e-mail account.

23:31.844 --> 23:35.746
David? No way.
But he is up to something.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.615
The kind of something
that makes a woman

23:37.617 --> 23:39.083
Want to hack into her
boyfriend's e-mail account?

23:39.085 --> 23:42.119
I just found the doctor who gave
andrew nichols the drugs.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.821
Bnc flew him in

23:43.823 --> 23:45.022
And stashed him in a hotel
before the interview.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.825
There he is --
farragut towers, room 404.

23:49.027 --> 23:50.161
I'm guessing carla steele

23:50.163 --> 23:51.829
Doesn't know
you ditched the p.A.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.030
Who's supposed to be
keeping you in your room.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.498
So, what?
You here to threaten me?

23:54.500 --> 23:55.866
Not if we don't have to.

23:55.868 --> 24:00.471
Your private life
a little little less private.

24:00.473 --> 24:01.872
Trust me.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.842
My dirty laundry's already out
where everyone can see it.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.877
Nothing to do now
but get paid.

24:07.846 --> 24:09.747
You honestly don't care
if you're responsible

24:09.749 --> 24:11.882
For ruining a good man's
political career?

24:11.884 --> 24:15.019
Should have thought of that
before she called me.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.227
I sent chandler
the nsa recording.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.562
She wants to meet publius.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.130
Good.
Good? Not good.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.699
I'm the white house
press secretary.

24:28.701 --> 24:29.700
I can't meet her.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.969
And I'm too close
to all of this.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.672
I'm gonna get caught.
James, relax.

24:34.674 --> 24:37.808
She can't go public
with a story of this magnitude

24:37.810 --> 24:39.810
Without verifying the identity
of her source.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.880
Yeah, I also know what
my husband is capable of.

24:42.882 --> 24:45.549
What if she makes
the story about me?

24:45.551 --> 24:46.917
A traitor inside
the administration --

24:46.919 --> 24:49.086
That is a headline.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.855
Okay, I'll go.
I'll meet her.

24:50.857 --> 24:51.922
She doesn't know
who her source is.

24:51.924 --> 24:54.825
Is to get this story
into the press.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.660
Text vanessa
a meeting place and a time.

to handle it?

The only thing worse
than running for president

Is trying to run for president
while actually being president.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.892

Olivia's suggesting
taking andrew off the ticket.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.228
I just want to make sure
you are not on board with that.

but she may be right.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.265
We're talking about drugs,

If liv can't shut it down,
no one can.

25:36.836 --> 25:37.935
Andrew's a good man.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.270
We shouldn't throw him
overboard

25:39.272 --> 25:40.871
Just because we're taking on
a little water.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.206
I'll discuss it with olivia.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.774
Andrew's in the family.
He's loyal.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.042
I can't believe
you'd even consider --

25:45.044 --> 25:46.777
I will discuss it
with olivia.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.313
Okay. I'll take it off your
plate, and talk to her myself.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.749
Like hell you will.

25:51.751 --> 25:52.750
Fitz,
I'm just trying to be helpful.

25:52.752 --> 25:53.984
Helpful.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.186
And handing her
a list of men to date?

25:56.188 --> 25:58.155
That kind of helpful?

25:58.157 --> 25:59.323
I was solving a problem.

25:59.325 --> 26:02.826
Olivia is not your problem
to solve.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.828
Fitz.
You stay away from olivia.

What does that feel like?

26:08.801 --> 26:10.134

26:10.136 --> 26:15.239
To be so...Hot for someone,
so turned on by them

26:15.241 --> 26:17.608
That you would put everything
you have ever worked for

26:17.610 --> 26:18.943
At risk.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.879
Does it feel good?

26:21.881 --> 26:25.649
Is it an amazing high?

26:25.651 --> 26:27.751
Or is it so intense
that it actually hurts,

26:27.753 --> 26:28.852
Like a fire in your belly?

26:37.095 --> 26:40.030
Mellie...

26:45.937 --> 26:47.905

Really? So me sticking
my fingers down your throat,

27:05.725 --> 27:07.825
That was what,
a typical Tuesday night?

27:07.827 --> 27:10.894
Do you want me to acknowledge
that it happened?

27:10.896 --> 27:12.296
Would that make this
less weird for you?

27:12.298 --> 27:13.797
Or do you want me
to thank you?

27:13.799 --> 27:18.002
For saving me from my sad,
little suicide attempt.

27:18.004 --> 27:20.037
Thank you for agreeing
not to call an ambulance.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.106
Thank you for sitting up
with me all night

Thank you.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.013
Okay? Are we done?

27:29.015 --> 27:30.881
I don't want you
to thank me.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.650
I want you to tell me why.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.690
Because my father-in-law
forced himself on me,

27:39.692 --> 27:41.025
And I don't know
if my son is his,

27:41.027 --> 27:44.762
And sometimes that makes me
not want to be alive.

who andrew's protecting.

I don't know, but the fastest
way to discredit a source

To cancel
carla steele's interview.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.408
Turns out their source
was being paid off,

29:04.410 --> 29:05.743
So the story on andrew
is dead.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.945
That's great news.
Yes.

Believe me. I know.

But it has to stop now.
We have an election to win.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.948
You know.
Mellie --

29:44.950 --> 29:47.851
You know how hard this is for me
because you somehow think

29:47.853 --> 29:50.220
That you screwing my husband
is equal to --

with the chance to cheat,

I kept my knees together,
and I said no.

in san diego,

that doctor again.
