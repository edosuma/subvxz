00:05.840 --> 00:08.002
There's pretty much nothing
the Winchesters can't do

00:08.080 --> 00:09.366
if they work together.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.441
Figured out how to close
the Gates of Hell.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.404
Heaven needs your help, Castiel.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.926
Hello, Castiel.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.489
I deserve to be loved!

01:17.160 --> 01:18.446
Sammy, Stop!

01:18.480 --> 01:20.323
Let it go.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.482
- Ah!
- Sam?

01:30.240 --> 01:31.651
What's happening?

01:32.960 --> 01:33.961
Angels.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.686
They're falling.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.851
This makes no sense.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.247
I mean, how many angels fell?
Hundreds, thousands?

01:49.320 --> 01:51.209
And nobody sees anything?

01:51.280 --> 01:53.726
This is... Look at this.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.569
They're calling it
a meteor shower.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.801
Seriously?

02:00.000 --> 02:00.967
What's going on, man, you okay?

02:01.040 --> 02:02.041
Me?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.850
Yeah.
It's fine. It's just...

02:04.880 --> 02:07.804
Just we got a major frickin'
crap-fest on our hands,

02:07.880 --> 02:08.801
yeah, tell me about it.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.042
Thousands of superpowered dicks
touchin' down

02:11.120 --> 02:13.168
and we got no idea
where to start.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.609
Angels aren't our problem,
right now, okay?

02:16.680 --> 02:18.125
Or demons or Metatron

02:18.240 --> 02:19.605
or whatever the hell
happened to Cass.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.921
Why, because we hugged it out
in that church

02:22.000 --> 02:24.367
and now we're gonna
go to Disneyland?

02:24.400 --> 02:26.209
Dean, you said it yourself,

02:26.240 --> 02:27.571
we're not gonna sleep
till this is done.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.409
I know.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.528
So what's the problem?

02:32.960 --> 02:34.007
You.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.765
Look, there's no easy way
to say this, okay?

02:37.800 --> 02:40.610
But something happened
back there in the church.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.484
Hey, I don't know what,
I don't know why.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.246
You're dying, Sam.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.241
Shut up.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.401
The MRI shows
massive internal burns

03:29.440 --> 03:31.488
affecting many
of the major organs.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.484
Oxygen to the brain
has been severely deprived.

03:35.560 --> 03:39.281
The coma is the result
of the body doing everything

03:39.320 --> 03:42.324
in its limited power to protect
itself from further harm.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.571
So what's supposed to happen?

03:48.600 --> 03:51.410
If your brother continues
on this trajectory,

03:51.560 --> 03:53.847
the machines might
keep him alive, but...

03:53.960 --> 03:55.200
He'll be dead.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.250
Technically, yes.
I'm afraid so.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.330
So, there's...
there's no recovering.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.722
I mean, there's no bounce-back,
there's no nothin'?

04:05.800 --> 04:07.689
I'm afraid
that's in God's hands now.

04:10.440 --> 04:11.362
You're a doctor.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.250
You're a medical professional.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.163
You're trying to tell me
that my brother's life

04:16.240 --> 04:17.526
is in God's hands?

04:17.600 --> 04:19.170
What is that, supposed to be a...
a comfort?

04:19.240 --> 04:20.240
Mr. Doherty...

04:20.320 --> 04:23.164
No, God has nothing to do
with this equation at all!

04:23.280 --> 04:25.000
- I didn't mean...
- That's not good enough!

04:50.760 --> 04:52.046
Cass, you there?

04:56.320 --> 04:57.560
Sammy's hurt.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.321
He's hurt.
He's hurt pretty bad.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.480
And, uh...

05:10.560 --> 05:12.449
I know you think
that I'm pissed at you.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.568
Okay, but I don't care
that the angels fell.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.769
So whatever you did
or didn't do,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.081
it doesn't matter.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.765
Okay, we'll work it out.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.203
Please, man, I need you here.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.081
Screw it.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.120
Okay, listen up.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.161
This one goes out to any angel
with their ears on.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.285
This is Dean Winchester.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.281
And I need your help.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.481
This is Dean Winchester.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.050
And I need your help.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.725
Linwood Memorial Hospital.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.846
Randolph, New York.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.287
The first one who can help me
gets my help in return

06:16.320 --> 06:17.731
and you know that ain't nothing.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.642
Honey?

06:19.720 --> 06:20.767
Now it's no secret

06:20.800 --> 06:22.802
that we haven't always seen
eye-to-eye.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.362
But you know that I am good
for my word.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.925
And, uh...

06:31.360 --> 06:33.328
...I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't needing.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.401
So...

06:42.760 --> 06:44.410
Look, just because you're dying,
doesn't mean you're dead,

06:44.480 --> 06:45.402
not yet, okay?

06:45.480 --> 06:46.606
We have jimmied ourselves
out of worse.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.880
We're gonna fight this.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.008
I got the plan, you just got to
hang on, you hear me?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.001
Absolutely.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.687
- You think I'm lying.
- Pretty much, yeah.

06:57.760 --> 06:58.682
Hey, you understand that

06:58.760 --> 07:00.125
we're not really in this car
right now.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.288
We're in your head.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.687
And you're in a coma
and are dying.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.440
How do you know that?

07:11.480 --> 07:14.927
Because I'm you. And you're you.
All of this is you.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.001
We're in your head!

07:17.280 --> 07:18.361
You're serious.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.083
The whole reason I stopped
doing the Trials was not to die.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.600
Then the next time
we see Naomi

07:31.640 --> 07:34.325
or Metatron or whoever's
to blame for this,

07:34.360 --> 07:35.521
we will get some justice.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.405
But for right now
we got to fight this, man.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.608
Okay.
All right, what's the plan?

07:40.680 --> 07:41.761
I'm working on it.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.365
What does that mean?

07:43.440 --> 07:45.727
I'm... I'm kind of dying
here, apparently.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.689
It means I'm working on it.
All right?

07:49.360 --> 07:52.364
The thing is, if I am dying,

07:52.400 --> 07:53.686
and I believe you, I do.

07:53.720 --> 07:58.521
But if you're you,
but you're really me and...

07:58.560 --> 08:01.245
And you're the part of me
that wants to fight to live...

08:01.280 --> 08:02.520
Yes.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.608
I have no idea what you
just said, but continue.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.484
But if

08:08.560 --> 08:12.770
you don't have any idea
how I'm supposed to fight,

08:12.840 --> 08:14.569
then am I supposed
to be fighting at all?

08:16.040 --> 08:17.087
Are you serious?

08:17.160 --> 08:19.083
Hell, yes, he's serious.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.366
I mean, if you ask me,

08:20.400 --> 08:22.562
I think the kid's got
a good point.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.447
Hey, buddy.

08:54.760 --> 08:55.761
You Okay?

09:00.560 --> 09:02.210
It hurts.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.202
The hell you doin',

09:03.280 --> 09:04.680
in the middle of the road
like that?

09:06.600 --> 09:07.806
I heard angels.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.803
How about we get you
some water, hmm?

09:15.280 --> 09:17.760
I, uh, I don't drink water.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.643
Dehydration's a real bitch
up here, mister.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.647
A phone.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.489
Do you have a phone?

09:23.760 --> 09:24.761
No signal up here.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.050
How about a lift, hmm?

09:31.640 --> 09:33.802
Yes. Good.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.049
I would fly, but I...
I have no wings.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.485
Not anymore.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.921
Right.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.125
Sam wants to die and
you think he's got a point?

09:45.160 --> 09:46.810
Okay, I don't want to die.

09:46.840 --> 09:47.807
I asked if maybe I was
supposed to d...

09:47.840 --> 09:48.807
Shut it, Sam.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.841
You, go.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.604
Oh, and before you
throw me under the bus,

09:51.680 --> 09:53.205
you're welcome
for the Hell rescue.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.891
Hey, first of all,
you didn't rescue jack,

09:55.960 --> 09:57.121
half-wit, Sam did.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.686
Second of all,
Sam, you're in a coma.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.728
Now suck as that may,

10:01.800 --> 10:03.802
sometimes, that's just
the way things go.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.330
What're you talking about?
There's always a way!

10:05.360 --> 10:06.327
You taught us that!

10:06.360 --> 10:07.441
Oh, you mean, like
the way one of you

10:07.520 --> 10:09.648
idjits does some
bass-ackwards, crazy thing

10:09.680 --> 10:11.603
to beat Death,
like sell your soul?

10:11.680 --> 10:13.170
Exactly like selling my soul!

10:13.200 --> 10:15.043
Yeah, like that worked
so well the last time.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.321
Enough, both of you.
I can't hear myself think!

10:21.240 --> 10:22.890
Wait, you're not actually
buying this, are you?

10:22.960 --> 10:24.291
Excuse me.
Are you dead?

10:24.360 --> 10:25.282
Because I am.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.840
And maybe I'm here
because I'm the part of Sam

10:27.880 --> 10:28.881
that actually knows
what the hell

10:28.960 --> 10:29.960
he's talkin' about.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.162
Well, I'm in the front seat,
because Sam put me here,

10:32.200 --> 10:33.531
because he wants to fight.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.561
Right?

10:37.160 --> 10:39.481
Well, that just got
real uncomfortable.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.846
See ya, Dean.

10:40.880 --> 10:41.961
Sam, don't you dare...

10:44.480 --> 10:46.323
Yep, yep, yep, am I right?

10:50.080 --> 10:51.320
Honestly, Bobby, I... I...

10:52.880 --> 10:54.041
I don't know what's right.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.246
Let's walk.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.441
Hey.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.170
No, I can't take your money.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.726
For the phone and a sandwich,
if they have one.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.125
It's okay, I don't eat.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.560
Well, you'll figure something.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.561
Take care, kid.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.686
Uh-huh.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
Hang up the phone.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.961
Right.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.641
Excuse me?

12:05.720 --> 12:07.290
This is an emergency.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.446
I don't want to hurt you.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.001
Hold on, hon.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.169
Sure, you do.
Hurt me.

12:15.800 --> 12:16.961
I'm sorry.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.210
I'm gonna finish this call,

12:28.280 --> 12:30.681
then I'm going to stab you.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.845
- I know you.
- I don't think so.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.285
Castiel.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.409
We met in Heaven.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.130
My name is Hael.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.049
You're an angel.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.088
Am I?

12:47.640 --> 12:49.130
What's an angel
without its wings?

12:55.920 --> 12:57.251
Hi.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.209
I'm just gonna break the ice.
Are you an angel?

12:59.400 --> 13:03.041
Sometimes I wish I were.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.361
My name is Kim Schortz
and I'm a grief counselor

13:05.400 --> 13:06.686
here at the hospital.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.960
Right, yeah, uh...

13:09.000 --> 13:10.126
Sorry, I'm just tired.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.360
Well, all due respect, but, uh,

13:14.720 --> 13:15.687
I'm not grieving.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.131
Not yet, at least. So...

13:17.200 --> 13:18.326
I'm afraid, as hard
as this may be,

13:18.400 --> 13:20.129
this might be
a good time to talk.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.726
About the inevitable.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.886
Look, I'm sure
you're a nice person

13:26.960 --> 13:28.200
and that you mean well.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.322
But inevitable?

13:30.400 --> 13:31.845
That's a fightin' word
where I come from.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.928
There's always a way.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.802
And I'm a prayerful woman
who believes in miracles

13:37.920 --> 13:39.081
as much as the next.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.730
But I also know
how to read an EEG.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.242
And unless you're telling me
you have a direct line

13:45.280 --> 13:47.044
to those angels
that you were looking for...

13:47.080 --> 13:49.924
Yeah. No, I, uh,

13:49.960 --> 13:51.200
guess I don't.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.531
But I might have
something better.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.968
I've got the King of Hell
in my trunk.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.566
That is... Is that...

14:03.600 --> 14:05.489
So, is that a metaphor?

14:12.280 --> 14:13.247
Crowley!

14:13.280 --> 14:14.486
Listen up, you son of a bitch.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.528
One for yes, two for no.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.761
You alive?

14:20.400 --> 14:21.765
Come on, don't be a pouter.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.565
There we go.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.841
You prayed?

14:27.080 --> 14:28.081
Yeah, for help.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.088
Yes. You'll be helping me.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.282
If you lie to me, Dean Winchester,
I will rip your throat out.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.441
Where is Castiel?

14:42.480 --> 14:44.084
Who's askin'?

14:44.120 --> 14:45.690
Try every angel who was
ejected from their home.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.491
Oh. Oh, well, in that case,
I have no clue.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.481
Easy there, brother.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.688
This young man has prayed
for our assistance.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.683
Are we creatures of wrath

14:58.760 --> 15:00.649
or compassion?

15:00.720 --> 15:01.926
I would argue the latter.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.923
Forgive me, brother.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.570
I don't recognize you.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.165
Happy to make your
re-acquaintance

15:08.240 --> 15:09.526
after you disarm.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.361
Come, now.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.925
Is that any way
to treat a brother

15:23.000 --> 15:24.047
injured in the fall?

15:43.320 --> 15:44.401
Who are you?

15:44.480 --> 15:46.209
Never mind me.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.169
You're Dean Winchester.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.601
I heard your prayer.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.409
And I am here to help.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.121
Okay.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.843
It was a normal day
and then just...

16:05.640 --> 16:06.640
...dark.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.201
And then I was just...

16:10.200 --> 16:11.247
...falling.

16:13.520 --> 16:14.851
How could that happen?

16:16.760 --> 16:17.807
I don't know.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.405
Your grace, it's gone?

16:25.560 --> 16:27.847
I do still hear angel radio,
though.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.729
Then you've heard them.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.367
Our brothers and sisters.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.244
Many still circling for vessels,
most just...

16:37.520 --> 16:39.010
...so afraid.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.601
There's nothing to be afraid of.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.489
I can assure you.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.086
In Heaven, there was order,

16:47.160 --> 16:50.482
there was purpose.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.723
Well, believe it or not,

16:53.760 --> 16:55.842
there may be something
even better down here.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.604
I don't understand.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.522
It's an opportunity
for you and the others

17:03.600 --> 17:05.204
who've fallen to finally...

17:06.760 --> 17:08.648
...do what you would
like to do.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.404
Not just what you've been told.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.007
And what would I...

17:14.160 --> 17:15.763
...like to do?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.290
Oh, you tell me.

17:18.440 --> 17:22.365
If you could do anything,
what would it be?

17:28.880 --> 17:31.008
There's a place.

17:31.080 --> 17:35.324
I built it, when I was
last here many years ago.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.728
A grand canyon.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.640
The Grand Canyon.
Yes.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.205
L... I would like to see that.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.730
Let's go see
the Grand Canyon then.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.241
You want to help?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.286
Start with a name.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.081
Ezekiel.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.764
All right, Ezekiel.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.083
How do I know you're not
huntin' me or Castiel,

18:15.160 --> 18:16.366
like the other angels?

18:16.440 --> 18:18.647
Oh, I'm sure there are
many angels who are.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.446
Many more are
on their way here, most likely.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.567
How do you know that?

18:25.640 --> 18:27.404
You put out an open prayer,
like that...

18:27.480 --> 18:29.005
I must really be desperate.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.883
Believe it or not,

18:38.920 --> 18:41.002
some of us still do believe
in our mission.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.486
And that means
we believe in Castiel.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.601
And you.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.928
You said you were hurt
during the fall.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.001
I was.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.487
And tangling with my brother
back there did me no favors.

18:54.560 --> 18:58.281
But what strength
I have left, I offer to you.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.085
I want to fight, I do,
but I just feel like...

19:05.120 --> 19:07.168
Like you got nothing
to swing at?

19:07.240 --> 19:08.765
Like you're punchin' at shadows?

19:10.400 --> 19:11.970
You got to let go of fightin'

19:12.040 --> 19:14.930
and scratchin'
and lookin' for loopholes

19:15.000 --> 19:16.240
'cause that ain't happenin'.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.607
So... so, what, I just die?

19:18.680 --> 19:20.523
Just die?

19:20.560 --> 19:23.006
All the good you've clone,
all the people you've saved,

19:23.080 --> 19:25.526
all the sacrifices you've made?

19:25.600 --> 19:27.409
You saved the world, son.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.245
How many people can say that?

19:30.280 --> 19:31.691
How many people can say

19:31.760 --> 19:34.047
that they have left
this godforsaken hunk of dirt

19:34.080 --> 19:35.730
that much a better place?

19:37.240 --> 19:40.449
What you call dyin',
I call leavin' a legacy.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.807
You still able to cure things?
After the fall?

19:53.920 --> 19:55.410
Yes, I should be, but...

19:56.840 --> 19:58.001
...he's so weak.

20:05.520 --> 20:06.646
Who is this?

20:06.680 --> 20:08.011
Dean.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.800
Cass, what the hell's goin' on?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.803
Metatron tricked me.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.291
It wasn't angel Trials,
it was a spell.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.327
I wanted you to know that.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.131
Okay, well, that's great,
but we got ourselves a problem.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.730
What's wrong?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.928
Sam. He's, um...

20:25.920 --> 20:27.251
They say he's dying.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.446
What happened?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.050
I don't know. At first, he was
okay, and then he wasn't.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.121
And I...
Have you heard my prayers?

20:31.160 --> 20:32.321
I've been praying to you
all night.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.562
Dean, Metatron, he...

20:35.920 --> 20:36.807
He took my grace.

20:36.920 --> 20:37.920
What?

20:37.960 --> 20:39.849
Don't worry about me.
What are you doing for Sam?

20:39.880 --> 20:40.961
Uh, everything I can.

20:41.000 --> 20:41.967
There's actually another angel
in there,

20:42.000 --> 20:42.967
working on him right now.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.126
What other angel?

20:44.160 --> 20:45.730
His name is Ezekiel.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.086
He's cool.
I mean, I think he is.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.924
Ezekiel.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.321
Yes, he's a good soldier.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.165
He should be able to help
until I get there.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.730
Wait, no, no, no, no.
Hey, that's not an option.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.926
Might be a few days, but...

20:57.000 --> 20:58.525
Hey, Cass, listen to me.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.489
There are angels
out there, okay?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.046
And they're lookin'
for you and they're pissed.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.531
Not all of them, Dean.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.211
Some are just looking
for direction.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.686
Some are just lost.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.006
What are you talkin' about?

21:11.080 --> 21:12.127
I've met one.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.531
I think I can help her, Dean.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.046
No, Cass, I know
you want to help, okay, I do.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.485
But helpin' angels is what
got you in trouble

21:17.520 --> 21:18.681
in the first place.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.883
Now I'm begging you.
For once, look out for yourself.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.285
Until we figure out
what the hell is goin' on,

21:23.360 --> 21:24.282
trust nobody.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.806
And do what?
Just abandon them all?

21:26.880 --> 21:28.530
Damn it, Cass,
you hearing yourself?

21:28.640 --> 21:31.120
There's a war on
and it's on you!

21:31.200 --> 21:32.850
There's thousands of 'em,
out th...

21:32.880 --> 21:34.848
You said you lost your grace,
right?

21:34.880 --> 21:35.927
That means you're human.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.809
That means you bleed
and you eat and you sleep

21:37.880 --> 21:39.803
and all the things you never
had to worry about before.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.405
I'm fine, Dean.

21:42.960 --> 21:43.961
What was that?

21:45.080 --> 21:46.080
Whoa.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.120
What's going on?

21:47.200 --> 21:48.770
I think we got more company.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.002
Look, get your ass
to the bunker, alone.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.201
- You hear me?
- Dean...

21:52.240 --> 21:54.083
- Go, Cass!
- Dean...

21:56.680 --> 21:57.761
One of yours?

21:57.840 --> 21:59.569
Trying to secure a vessel.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.005
We need to move.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.128
No, no, if we move him, he dies.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.929
If we stay, we could all die.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.928
I don't understand.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.161
I'll come with you.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.287
We can see your friend together.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.811
It's complicated.

22:22.880 --> 22:23.961
There could be trouble.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.769
It's... It's best
if I go alone.

22:25.800 --> 22:29.566
My friend, he needs my help.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.761
I need help.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.920
You can do this, Hael.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.126
This is your chance,

22:39.120 --> 22:40.281
to help people,

22:42.040 --> 22:43.121
help yourself.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.811
I'm sorry.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.687
Long as these are up,
no angels are comin' in,

23:03.760 --> 23:04.921
no one's comin' out.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.120
You gonna be okay with these?

23:07.040 --> 23:08.121
I'll manage.

23:11.480 --> 23:12.402
What?

23:12.480 --> 23:13.481
They're here.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.040
Okay.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.730
Do not open this door
for anybody but me.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.723
Save him, you hear me?

23:36.280 --> 23:38.681
Everybody out, now!

23:38.760 --> 23:40.046
Get out!

24:01.160 --> 24:03.766
You understand that
I couldn't just let you leave.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.764
I'd be lost
without you, Castiel.

24:09.800 --> 24:10.801
Yes, I'm...

24:11.800 --> 24:13.689
...beginning to see that.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.131
It's the least
I could ask of you.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.246
Considering, well...

24:20.440 --> 24:22.090
This is all your fault,
isn't it?

24:25.600 --> 24:27.011
Making the angels fall?

24:30.200 --> 24:31.167
So,

24:31.200 --> 24:33.521
we'll drive to the Grand Canyon.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.289
You'll tell me
more about humans.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.200
And I'll show you
what I'm capable of.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.086
We're going to become
more than just friends, Castiel.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.211
We're going to become one.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.561
You want to possess me.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.045
Your vessel is strong.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.083
This one won't hold me
much longer.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.726
You were right, Castiel.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.650
With us together...

25:04.760 --> 25:06.360
...I think I could learn
to like it here.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.731
Hey, you got to get out of here.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.761
Come on.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.761
Come on.

25:14.840 --> 25:15.841
Whoa.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.125
Stay behind me.

25:22.760 --> 25:23.761
Or not.

25:28.880 --> 25:29.927
There it is.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.487
Everything inside you need
to help you on your way.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.965
Go on, son.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.802
I'll be waitin' for you
with a couple of cold ones.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.644
Ah!

25:50.280 --> 25:51.486
Sorry, old man.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.841
Dean, are you insane?

25:53.920 --> 25:54.921
Come on, Sammy.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.649
Bobby was the part of you
that wants to die!

25:57.720 --> 26:00.007
I know it stings,
but he had to go.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.770
No, you have to go.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.450
When are you gonna realize?

26:03.480 --> 26:05.130
It's over!

26:05.160 --> 26:06.685
There's nothing to fight for!

26:06.760 --> 26:08.649
No, see, I know
you don't believe that.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.489
Really?

26:12.160 --> 26:14.128
Then what's your plan, Dean?

26:16.840 --> 26:18.001
My plan?

26:19.520 --> 26:21.284
My plan is to fight!

26:21.320 --> 26:23.971
My plan is to try!

26:24.000 --> 26:26.321
My plan is to give a damn!

26:26.360 --> 26:28.488
You tellin' me
there's nothing, huh?

26:28.520 --> 26:29.965
You telling me
there's nothing to fight for?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.002
That there's nothing
to hope for?

26:32.040 --> 26:34.327
No.
I'm telling you there is.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.240
You might not like it,
you might not accept it,

26:38.320 --> 26:39.731
but it's in there.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.801
It's in that house.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.285
You know what's in that house!

26:43.520 --> 26:44.806
Now I can't help you,

26:44.840 --> 26:46.524
if you ain't willing
to fight for yourself!

26:51.880 --> 26:53.041
I know.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.441
It's okay.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.727
It's what I want.

27:21.880 --> 27:23.245
Oh!

27:23.400 --> 27:24.606
Let me make this easy.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.011
Tell me where Castiel is

27:26.080 --> 27:27.570
or your brother's gonna wish
he were dead.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.762
Yeah, good luck
getting past the warding.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.569
But we will.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
Oh!

27:34.080 --> 27:36.970
And when we do,
I'm gonna strip off all his skin

27:37.040 --> 27:38.087
and you're gonna watch.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.201
Bite me.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.803
Oh!

27:50.000 --> 27:52.287
Anybody ever tell you,
you hit like an angel?

28:13.760 --> 28:15.125
Hello, Sam.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.049
I've been waiting for you.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.046
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.245
I'll tell you where Cass is.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.450
I just have one question.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.766
Ask.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.325
If Heaven is locked,

28:42.400 --> 28:44.721
then where do you go
when I do this?

28:45.920 --> 28:48.207
No!

28:57.880 --> 28:59.484
What the hell's happening?

28:59.520 --> 29:01.124
This just started.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.491
And the warding...

29:04.280 --> 29:05.720
I'm afraid
I'm weaker than I thought.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.126
I am sorry, Dean.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.810
No, no, no, no.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.205
No, we had a deal, okay?

29:13.280 --> 29:14.964
I fight, you save!

29:15.000 --> 29:16.206
And would that I could.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.286
I'm just afraid it's too late.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.367
You kidding me?

29:20.920 --> 29:23.120
Are you saying there's no way
to save my brother's life?

29:23.440 --> 29:24.566
No good ways, I'm afraid.

29:24.640 --> 29:25.760
Well, what are the bad ones?

29:27.600 --> 29:28.567
We're out of options here, man!

29:28.640 --> 29:30.165
Good or bad, let me hear 'em!

29:30.200 --> 29:31.361
I cannot promise,

29:32.680 --> 29:34.682
but there is a chance
I can fix your brother.

29:38.720 --> 29:40.609
So, what, you open him up?

29:43.760 --> 29:46.001
What, possession?
You want to possess Sam?

29:46.040 --> 29:47.883
- I told you.
- No way.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.803
Understood.
It's your call.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.801
No, it's Sam's call.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.680
There's no way in hell
he'd say yes

29:54.720 --> 29:56.085
to being possessed by anything.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.730
He would rather die.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.725
I'll leave you two alone then.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.245
Wait.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.205
If I consider this,

30:33.240 --> 30:34.651
and I mean, just consider it...

30:35.920 --> 30:37.570
I need somethin', man.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.443
You got to prove to me
how bad he is.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.081
Close your eyes.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.569
I must admit,
when I heard it was you,

30:54.640 --> 30:57.450
well, I had to come myself.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.402
I bet you get off on this.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.771
Perhaps.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.360
But not in the way you assume.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.568
I consider it
to be quite the honor

31:08.600 --> 31:11.285
to be collecting the likes
of Sam Winchester.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.883
I try so hard
not to pass judgment

31:14.960 --> 31:16.121
at times like this.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.326
Not my bag, you see.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.811
But you...

31:22.080 --> 31:23.684
Well played, my boy-

31:32.240 --> 31:33.844
I need to know one thing.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.487
Yes?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.051
If I go with you...

31:46.120 --> 31:51.047
...can you promise that this time,
it will be final?

31:52.480 --> 31:56.644
That if I'm dead, I stay dead?

31:56.680 --> 31:58.967
Nobody can reverse it,
nobody can deal it away,

32:01.160 --> 32:03.925
and nobody else can get hurt
because of me?

32:07.040 --> 32:08.405
I can promise that.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.321
What the hell
are you doing, Sam?

32:13.360 --> 32:14.600
As you can see,
there's not much time.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.125
I know.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.321
Damn it, I know.

32:46.520 --> 32:47.521
How would it work?

32:49.160 --> 32:51.481
Mutual benefit, I suppose.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.722
I heal Sam while healing myself.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.446
And when he's healed?

32:56.520 --> 32:57.851
I leave.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.721
It's the best
of a bad situation, Dean.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.521
Even if I said yes,
it doesn't mean squat.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.529
Sam would never say yes,
not to you.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.570
But he would say yes to you.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.488
Oh...

34:05.040 --> 34:06.690
I don't want to hurt you.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.649
I didn't want to hurt
any of them.

34:08.679 --> 34:09.841
I want to help you.

34:09.920 --> 34:13.322
I will devote my life
to helping you all.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.324
Do you know
how ridiculous you sound?

34:16.400 --> 34:20.199
Help angels after what you did?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.649
They don't want
your help, Castiel,

34:23.719 --> 34:24.926
they want your head.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.166
You're wrong.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.168
I'm one of you.

34:28.239 --> 34:29.924
I will never stop
being one of you.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.081
Don't you get it?

34:32.239 --> 34:35.083
Together, I can protect you,
Castiel.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.284
I don't need your...

34:40.800 --> 34:43.121
I don't want your protection.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.844
If you leave me here,
in this broken girl,

34:44.880 --> 34:47.770
I swear it, Castiel,
I will tell them where you are!

34:47.840 --> 34:49.728
And they will hunt you.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.165
Until their last breath,

34:51.239 --> 34:53.641
they will seek revenge
on the angel that did this,

34:53.679 --> 34:55.170
who destroyed Heaven!

34:55.199 --> 34:56.326
Stop.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.011
They will seek
a vengeance on you

34:59.040 --> 35:00.849
that will make God striking down

35:00.880 --> 35:02.120
Lucifer seem like child's play!

35:02.200 --> 35:03.122
Stop it.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.646
I will go on angel radio
and tell them everything

35:05.680 --> 35:07.603
unless you open your heart.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.681
Say yes.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.490
It's time, Sam.
Shall we?

35:20.520 --> 35:21.851
Hold on.

35:21.880 --> 35:22.847
Dean.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.291
It's okay, Sam.

35:25.480 --> 35:29.530
I, uh, would've brought cronuts,
but time is short. So...

35:30.480 --> 35:32.130
- By all means.
- What's goin' on?

35:32.200 --> 35:33.122
I found a plan.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.362
It's too late. I'm going.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.526
No, no, no, no, no,
listen to me.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.971
Why are you even here?

35:38.040 --> 35:39.246
I'm not fighting this anymore!

35:39.320 --> 35:40.481
You have to fight this!

35:42.280 --> 35:44.248
I can fix this,

35:44.320 --> 35:45.606
okay, but not
if you shut me out.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.287
It's not his time.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.522
That's for Sam to decide.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.528
Sam, listen to me.
I made you a promise,

35:59.560 --> 36:03.246
in that church.
You and me, come whatever.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.289
Well, hell,
if this ain't whatever.

36:07.320 --> 36:10.563
But you got to let me in, man,
you got to let me help!

36:10.600 --> 36:12.443
There ain't no me,
if there ain't no you!

36:22.560 --> 36:23.641
What do I do?

36:25.040 --> 36:26.166
Is that a yes?

36:30.920 --> 36:32.365
Yes.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.446
Come on.

36:52.800 --> 36:53.801
Who are you?

36:55.280 --> 36:56.520
What the hell is going on here?

36:56.600 --> 36:58.807
I have no idea.

37:03.160 --> 37:07.210
So how's it look in there?

37:07.280 --> 37:08.280
Not good.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.482
There is much work to be done.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.848
Yeah, but he's gonna wake up,
right?

37:13.960 --> 37:14.961
He Will.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.327
So when he does,

37:17.360 --> 37:19.010
what...
What, is he gonna feel you inside,

37:19.040 --> 37:20.485
triaging his spleen?

37:20.560 --> 37:22.050
He will not feel me, no.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.851
There is no reason for Sam
to know I am in here at all.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.604
You're joking.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.444
I mean, no, this is...
This is too big.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.800
And What Will he do,

37:30.840 --> 37:33.047
if you do tell him
he is possessed by an angel?

37:35.840 --> 37:37.080
Well, he'll have to understand.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.730
And if he does not?

37:41.120 --> 37:45.011
Without his acceptance,
Sam can eject me at any time,

37:45.040 --> 37:46.690
especially with me so weak.

37:47.800 --> 37:51.202
And if Sam does eject me,
he will die.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.128
Then we keep it a secret
for now.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.006
Or until Sam's well enough

38:09.040 --> 38:11.884
that he doesn't need
an angelic pacemaker.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.121
Or I find a way to tell him.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.440
I...

38:15.440 --> 38:16.407
As for him
being in the hospital,

38:16.520 --> 38:17.442
I have to figure something out.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.045
I can erase it all if you like.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.644
He will not remember
any of this.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.689
Where are we?

40:20.760 --> 40:22.967
Whoa. Sam?

40:24.840 --> 40:25.807
What?

40:25.840 --> 40:26.807
Okay, take...
Take it easy.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.000
How you, uh, how you feelin'?

40:29.400 --> 40:30.401
Tired.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.688
Like I've slept for a week.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.091
Well, try a day.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.362
You've been out since the sky
was spittin' angels.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.970
What the hell happened?

40:40.400 --> 40:41.606
What do you remember?

40:42.840 --> 40:45.605
The church, feelin' like crap...

40:46.640 --> 40:48.165
The angels falling and...

40:49.360 --> 40:50.327
...that's it.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.805
But you're feelin' good?

40:54.040 --> 40:55.883
Yeah.
I mean, I... I just, um...

40:57.720 --> 40:59.006
What, you've been
driving around with me

40:59.040 --> 41:00.485
passed out in the passenger
seat for a day?

41:00.560 --> 41:01.721
Nah, I mean, I stopped.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.724
You know, let a few Japanese
tourists take some pictures.

41:04.800 --> 41:05.847
Nobody got too handsy.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.565
I knew you'd pull through.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.120
I meant what I said
at the church.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.924
You're capable of anything, Sam.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.241
And hell,
if you didn't prove me right.

41:25.720 --> 41:28.371
Good.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.851
Because we got work to do.
