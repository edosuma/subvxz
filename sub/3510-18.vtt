00:02.633 --> 00:04.348
Welcome to "A Night Of Dance,"

00:04.412 --> 00:06.227
America's favorite
dance competition,

00:06.296 --> 00:07.550
with your host...

00:07.551 --> 00:09.551
Brad Melville!

00:11.271 --> 00:13.580
Hey, hey, hey!

00:14.268 --> 00:16.285
Good evening, America.

00:16.614 --> 00:18.259
It's dance-off time,

00:18.260 --> 00:20.558
and the theme is... Latin.

00:20.559 --> 00:22.270
As always, tonight's challengers

00:22.271 --> 00:24.389
were hand picked by the judges.

00:24.413 --> 00:26.752
Max, are you looking
forward to watching

00:26.753 --> 00:28.053
these two rumba?

00:28.106 --> 00:30.589
I'm looking forward to
Santino redeeming himself

00:30.590 --> 00:33.529
for his samba-inspired
solo dance last week.

00:33.530 --> 00:34.585
Pathetic.

00:34.586 --> 00:35.952
It was like a terrible dream

00:35.953 --> 00:37.355
my dog would have

00:37.356 --> 00:40.907
after eating the leftovers
of my brazilian dinner.

00:40.908 --> 00:41.757
Well, then.

00:41.758 --> 00:43.359
You know our semifinalists.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.818
Our matchup is-- Santino versus...

00:46.819 --> 00:48.272
Odette.

00:48.273 --> 00:51.945
Can the arrogant bad boy
best America's sweetheart?

00:51.946 --> 00:53.739
Let's get right to it.

00:53.786 --> 00:55.204
Tonight's elimination dance

00:55.205 --> 00:56.930
between Santino and Odette

00:56.931 --> 00:59.262
will mean the end of the
road for one of them.

00:59.263 --> 01:02.165
One will be eliminated on
Monday's results show.

01:02.166 --> 01:06.287
The other will be guaranteed
a spot in the final two.

01:06.358 --> 01:07.649
Ladies and gentlemen--

01:07.670 --> 01:10.884
Santino and Odette!

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.839 --> 01:29.456
Odette, are you in there?

01:36.707 --> 01:39.820
Guess who I ran into at
the beauty parlor today?

01:39.821 --> 01:41.424
Mother, I'm at a
critical juncture and--

01:41.425 --> 01:43.010
Oona Marconi.

01:43.011 --> 01:44.896
Oona Marconi the theater critic?

01:44.897 --> 01:46.695
I thought I might
invite her to dinner

01:46.696 --> 01:50.274
ask her to give a little
mention to my acting school,

01:50.275 --> 01:52.265
put it into one of her columns.

01:52.266 --> 01:53.854
It would be
invaluable publicity.

01:53.855 --> 01:55.798
Yes, well, that would
depend on the mention.

01:55.799 --> 01:58.674
You aren't forgetting her
blistering review...

01:58.675 --> 01:59.437
of your performance

01:59.438 --> 02:01.476
of Maggie in "Cat On a
Hot Tin Roof," are you?

02:01.477 --> 02:02.697
That was 1983.

02:02.698 --> 02:03.947
I think I'm over it.

02:03.948 --> 02:06.370
"Martha Rodgers
as Maggie The Cat

02:06.371 --> 02:08.661
"is more of a helpless kitten,

02:08.775 --> 02:11.788
mewing and flapping her hands
when she doesn't get her way."

02:11.902 --> 02:12.742
You memorized it?

02:12.743 --> 02:13.906
I couldn't help it.

02:13.907 --> 02:16.528
You walked around the apartment
quoting it for months.

02:16.529 --> 02:18.139
Mother, I'm just saying,

02:18.140 --> 02:20.243
maybe it's not a
good idea to ask

02:20.244 --> 02:22.073
an important favor of
someone who's been

02:22.074 --> 02:25.103
so... unkind to you in the past.

02:25.104 --> 02:27.935
The operative word
here is "past."

02:27.936 --> 02:30.706
I think I can rise above.

02:30.707 --> 02:31.611
Besides, my acting school

02:31.612 --> 02:33.993
is more important to me
than some old grudge.

02:33.994 --> 02:35.698
Well, that's very
mature of you, mother.

02:35.699 --> 02:36.863
Thank you.

02:37.112 --> 02:40.105
"If Tennessee Williams knew
what crimes Martha Rodgers

02:40.106 --> 02:42.145
"had committed against
this audience in his name,

02:42.146 --> 02:45.061
he would have her
arrested for assault."

02:46.570 --> 02:48.595
Rising above.

02:50.778 --> 02:52.598
Come on, Castle.
How mean can this critic be?

02:52.599 --> 02:55.210
I'm just afraid that she's gonna
get her heart broken, you know?

02:55.211 --> 02:55.994
I mean, you know my mother.

02:55.995 --> 02:57.695
On the exterior, she's
a tough cookie.

02:57.696 --> 03:00.425
But underneath all
that bravado--

03:00.655 --> 03:02.051
gooey center.

03:02.146 --> 03:03.376
Hey, Lanie.

03:03.593 --> 03:04.830
So who's our victim?

03:04.831 --> 03:05.713
Odette Morton.

03:05.714 --> 03:08.344
'Cause of death is a single
GSW to the heart.

03:08.345 --> 03:10.899
Probably a 9 millimeter.
She died instantly.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.185
The bullet went
right through her.

03:12.186 --> 03:14.533
Well, unless our
killer used a silencer

03:14.534 --> 03:15.838
someone must have
heard the shot.

03:15.839 --> 03:17.225
Not necessarily.

03:17.226 --> 03:19.497
According to the stage manager,
this area clears out

03:19.498 --> 03:20.474
once taping starts.

03:20.475 --> 03:23.156
Plus the opening pyrotechnics
could've covered a gunshot.

03:23.157 --> 03:24.625
Well, that's assuming
that she was shot

03:24.626 --> 03:26.067
just as the show started.

03:26.068 --> 03:27.345
It looks like she was.

03:27.346 --> 03:28.550
Yeah, the, uh,

03:28.551 --> 03:31.177
makeup girl finished
with Odette at 2:45,

03:31.178 --> 03:32.726
taping starts at 3:00,

03:32.727 --> 03:34.392
and she was discovered at 3:04.

03:34.393 --> 03:36.518
19 minutes.
That's not a very big window.

03:36.519 --> 03:38.436
All right, see if the crew
saw anyone near this room

03:38.437 --> 03:39.105
around that time.

03:39.106 --> 03:40.337
You got it.

03:40.338 --> 03:42.090
Hey, Ryan. Can I get a list

03:42.091 --> 03:43.800
of all the guests that were
invited to tonight's taping

03:43.801 --> 03:45.495
along with anyone that
checked in at security?

03:45.496 --> 03:46.433
Uh, already on it,

03:46.434 --> 03:48.687
but that's not the
only way in here.

03:48.688 --> 03:50.756
There's an exit door to
the alley down the hall.

03:50.757 --> 03:52.043
The crew guys like
to prop it open

03:52.044 --> 03:53.256
so they can go out for a smoke.

03:53.257 --> 03:54.673
So either our killer got lucky

03:54.674 --> 03:55.551
and found an unlocked door...

03:55.552 --> 03:56.953
Or this was an inside job.

03:56.954 --> 03:58.279
That gets my vote.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.708
Odette was a lock
to win this thing.

04:00.709 --> 04:02.554
I bet it was one of her
backstabbing rivals

04:02.555 --> 04:03.873
that did this.

04:04.290 --> 04:05.461
What? I watch the show.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.463
Odette was my
favorite contestant.

04:07.464 --> 04:10.005
She was an heiress raised
by her rich grandpa,

04:10.006 --> 04:12.004
a party girl headed
down the wrong path,

04:12.005 --> 04:13.917
then a brush with death
made her wake up

04:13.918 --> 04:15.517
and change her bad-girl ways.

04:15.518 --> 04:17.069
That's a great story.

04:17.105 --> 04:18.031
Except for the ending.

04:18.031 --> 04:19.380
I gotta say, Dr. Parish.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.362
I never figured you for a
fan of "A Night Of Dance."

04:21.363 --> 04:23.646
I'm not exactly.

04:23.647 --> 04:24.897
It's just...

04:25.393 --> 04:26.958
when I was young,
more than anything,

04:26.959 --> 04:28.736
I wanted to be a
prima ballerina.

04:28.737 --> 04:31.642
If I wasn't dancing, I was
thinking about dancing.

04:31.643 --> 04:32.413
So what happened?

04:32.414 --> 04:34.793
The girls came along
when I was 13.

04:34.794 --> 04:37.149
Not that many top-heavy
ballerinas out there.

04:37.150 --> 04:38.505
Well, I think there should be.

04:38.506 --> 04:39.309
Of course you do.

04:39.310 --> 04:40.989
That's not what I meant.

04:41.455 --> 04:42.670
Although...

04:42.671 --> 04:44.024
Does Odette have
any next of kin?

04:44.025 --> 04:45.900
Um, Paul Morton, her brother.

04:45.901 --> 04:47.132
Okay, great.
Bring him down here.

04:47.133 --> 04:48.820
And talk to the rest
of the contestants.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.408
I want to see if anyone is
taking this competition

04:50.409 --> 04:52.272
just a little too seriously.

04:52.564 --> 04:53.691
We understand that
you and Odette

04:53.692 --> 04:55.779
were rehearsing your
dance most of the day.

04:55.780 --> 04:56.887
How did she seem?

04:56.888 --> 04:59.052
On edge. We both were.

04:59.105 --> 05:00.831
I mean, one of us was
about to be eliminated,

05:00.832 --> 05:03.043
which is why I can't believe she
just left rehearsal at 11:00

05:03.044 --> 05:04.188
and took off for half an hour.

05:04.189 --> 05:06.271
- To do what?
- She wouldn't say.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.288
But everything was
riding on this dance.

05:08.289 --> 05:09.928
She told me she had
to meet a friend.

05:09.929 --> 05:12.539
She asked me to cover if
anyone was looking for her.

05:14.901 --> 05:16.514
Um... do you have any idea

05:16.515 --> 05:18.167
why she was being so secretive?

05:18.168 --> 05:21.053
The producers don't like us to
leave the studio on show day.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.253
So it must have been important.

05:22.254 --> 05:24.384
Well, the NYPD thanks you

05:24.385 --> 05:25.945
for your cooperation.

05:26.971 --> 05:28.120
You, too.

05:31.093 --> 05:32.177
Damn.

05:32.178 --> 05:33.423
- Did you see that?
- Mm-hmm.

05:33.424 --> 05:35.300
She acted like I
didn't even exist.

05:35.301 --> 05:38.196
You don't. Not since you put
that ring on your finger.

05:38.367 --> 05:41.153
Get used to being invisible
to single women.

05:44.376 --> 05:46.992
I've never seen her happier
than these past couple months.

05:46.993 --> 05:49.188
I can't believe that
my sister's dead.

05:49.461 --> 05:51.458
We understand she had some...

05:51.459 --> 05:52.868
difficulties in the past.

05:52.869 --> 05:55.152
A few years ago, our
grandfather passed away,

05:55.153 --> 05:56.753
and Odette took it hard.

05:56.754 --> 05:57.930
Uh, she quit school,

05:57.931 --> 05:59.962
she broke off her
relationship with a nice guy,

05:59.963 --> 06:01.729
started hanging out
with a bad crowd.

06:01.730 --> 06:02.771
What kind of bad crowd?

06:02.772 --> 06:05.333
You know, partiers and druggies.

06:05.334 --> 06:06.758
She was arrested several times.

06:06.759 --> 06:09.473
But after the accident, she
left all of that behind.

06:09.474 --> 06:10.672
That was her brush with death?

06:10.673 --> 06:13.081
It was a train
derailment last year.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.635
Odette was on board.

06:14.636 --> 06:17.656
She made it out alive, but it
scared the hell out of her.

06:17.657 --> 06:19.215
She turned her life around.

06:19.216 --> 06:22.296
Six months of dance training,
and the next thing that I know,

06:22.297 --> 06:23.793
she's auditioned for
"A Night Of Dance"

06:23.794 --> 06:25.228
and been accepted.

06:25.264 --> 06:27.436
She finally found a
direction in life.

06:27.437 --> 06:29.982
She was so close to
realizing her dream.

06:29.983 --> 06:31.490
Was there anyone in
Odette's old life

06:31.491 --> 06:33.214
that could've come back
to cause trouble for her?

06:33.215 --> 06:34.920
Not that I'm aware of.

06:35.134 --> 06:37.798
What about on the show?
Anyone she didn't get along with?

06:37.799 --> 06:39.652
Uh, uh, she did mention someone,

06:39.653 --> 06:41.127
another contestant.

06:41.128 --> 06:43.103
I think she said his
name was Eddie.

06:47.056 --> 06:48.577
Detective Beckett,
they're waiting for you.

06:48.578 --> 06:49.716
Thank you.

06:51.176 --> 06:52.526
Detective Beckett,

06:52.555 --> 06:55.359
as co-creator and executive
producer of "Night Of Dance,"

06:55.360 --> 06:57.032
I have instructed my
staff to provide you

06:57.033 --> 06:58.757
with anything and
everything you need

06:58.758 --> 07:00.501
to help solve this
terrible murder.

07:00.502 --> 07:02.534
- Anything.
- Absolutely anything.

07:02.535 --> 07:03.146
Thanks.

07:03.147 --> 07:05.201
Now Odette told her brother
that there was someone

07:05.202 --> 07:07.062
on the show that she
didn't get along with.

07:07.063 --> 07:09.518
Eddie Gordon, but he's
not here anymore.

07:09.519 --> 07:11.107
Last week, Eddie and
Odette performed

07:11.108 --> 07:14.209
a Bob-Fosse-inspired number for
the elimination dance-off.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.257
We voted and sent Eddie home.

07:16.258 --> 07:17.877
He was upset.

07:17.878 --> 07:19.981
- How upset?
- Well, you have to understand,

07:19.982 --> 07:21.815
all the contestants
are cast on this show

07:21.816 --> 07:23.325
to tell their unique

07:23.326 --> 07:24.911
yet familiar stories.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.398
Odette was the poor
little rich girl,

07:26.399 --> 07:29.449
and Eddie was the kid from the
wrong side of the tracks.

07:29.577 --> 07:31.609
We cast Eddie to
bring the drama.

07:31.610 --> 07:32.652
Eddie brought the drama

07:32.653 --> 07:34.918
and not just for the cameras.

07:34.931 --> 07:36.732
He was furious when
we sent him packing.

07:36.733 --> 07:38.886
And we all got an
earful about it.

07:38.887 --> 07:40.366
Oh, and he was so rude.

07:40.367 --> 07:41.531
I had to call security.

07:41.532 --> 07:42.391
Was he threatening?

07:42.392 --> 07:46.301
Let's just say, I was
relieved when he was gone.

07:46.418 --> 07:47.286
Ironic, really.

07:47.287 --> 07:48.120
How so?

07:48.121 --> 07:49.248
Well, according to the rules,

07:49.249 --> 07:51.737
when a contestant is
unable to continue,

07:51.738 --> 07:53.589
the last eliminated
dancer returns

07:53.590 --> 07:54.850
to take his or her place.

07:54.851 --> 07:57.756
And that dancer is Eddie Gordon.

07:57.952 --> 07:58.607
Let me tell you something

07:58.608 --> 08:00.326
about Miss
Sweet-And-Innocent Odette.

08:00.327 --> 08:02.228
She threw me under
the bus tonight.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.025
She blew off
rehearsals all week,

08:04.026 --> 08:06.445
then messed up her footwork
and blames it on me.

08:06.586 --> 08:07.554
Where I'm from, we
know what to do

08:07.555 --> 08:09.080
with lying bitches like that.

08:11.119 --> 08:13.204
That was Eddie's exit interview.

08:13.205 --> 08:14.497
The contestants are
encouraged by producers

08:14.498 --> 08:16.136
to speak freely.

08:16.295 --> 08:17.547
He certainly took their advice.

08:17.548 --> 08:19.866
Eddie has got a record
back home in Rochester,

08:19.867 --> 08:21.862
and one of the assistants
at "A Night Of Dance"

08:21.863 --> 08:23.777
says they remember
seeing him in the studio

08:23.778 --> 08:25.466
the afternoon Odette
was murdered.

08:25.745 --> 08:27.649
Okay, so Eddie was eliminated,

08:27.650 --> 08:29.361
but he knew that if Odette
was out of the running,

08:29.362 --> 08:31.177
he'd be asked to return
and take her slot.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.677
So he went back and
eliminated Odette...

08:34.268 --> 08:35.561
permanently.

08:47.615 --> 08:49.029
B&E, robbery--

08:49.030 --> 08:51.781
you were pretty busy up
in Rochester, Eddie.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.589
Yeah, but that was
a long time ago.

08:53.662 --> 08:55.454
When I started dancing,
I gave up thug life.

08:55.455 --> 08:57.130
Yeah, well, that didn't
stop you from going off

08:57.131 --> 08:58.573
on the judges when
you were eliminated.

08:58.574 --> 09:00.477
Me going home was the wrong call

09:00.478 --> 09:01.164
and I said so.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.880
Maybe I said it loud, but
that don't make me no killer.

09:02.881 --> 09:04.878
Now that Odette can't
finish the competition,

09:04.879 --> 09:07.634
the last eliminated contestant
will be asked to return,

09:07.635 --> 09:09.162
and that's you, Eddie.

09:09.163 --> 09:10.106
Like my daddy used to say,

09:10.107 --> 09:11.835
the universe works
in mysterious ways.

09:11.836 --> 09:13.844
And maybe you decided
to give the universe

09:13.845 --> 09:15.597
just a little shove.

09:16.108 --> 09:18.510
So what were you doing at
the studio on show day?

09:18.511 --> 09:20.887
I went by early to
see my boy Santino.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.157
Give him support on his big day.

09:22.158 --> 09:23.540
You got an answer for
everything, don't you, Eddie?

09:23.541 --> 09:24.447
And you know what else you got?

09:24.448 --> 09:26.093
You got motive and opportunity.

09:26.094 --> 09:28.131
Man, I was across town
when that mess happened,

09:28.132 --> 09:29.298
meeting my agent.

09:29.299 --> 09:32.673
But last week, something was
going on with Odette.

09:33.428 --> 09:35.586
Something that didn't have
nothing to do with dancing.

09:35.587 --> 09:37.990
- What do you mean?
- She was out of it.

09:37.991 --> 09:39.628
Missing easy steps,

09:39.629 --> 09:40.882
she'd say she's going
to the ladies room,

09:40.883 --> 09:42.212
and then be gone
for half an hour.

09:42.213 --> 09:43.211
What do you think she was doing?

09:43.212 --> 09:44.687
I know what she was doing.

09:44.688 --> 09:46.634
I saw her go out the back door,

09:46.890 --> 09:48.559
meet some guy in the alley.

09:48.783 --> 09:51.051
They talked real
serious for a minute,

09:51.790 --> 09:53.831
then she handed him
a roll of bills.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.425
Looked like 3 grand easy.

09:55.426 --> 09:56.782
You get a good enough
look at this guy?

09:56.783 --> 09:58.938
You think you can provide
us with a sketch?

09:58.974 --> 10:00.748
Yeah. I can do that.

10:01.693 --> 10:02.345
Hey.

10:02.346 --> 10:04.301
So Eddie Gordon spoke the truth.

10:04.302 --> 10:06.367
He was meeting with his
agent when Odette was shot.

10:06.368 --> 10:07.698
So maybe he was also
telling the truth

10:07.699 --> 10:09.855
about the guy he saw
Odette with in the alley.

10:10.352 --> 10:11.512
Well, he gave us a sketch.

10:11.513 --> 10:12.972
Pretty generic, though.

10:12.973 --> 10:14.684
Handsome, Caucasian, dark hair.

10:14.685 --> 10:17.288
You know, that missing half-hour
when Odette left rehearsal

10:17.289 --> 10:18.790
the day she was shot--

10:18.901 --> 10:20.497
maybe she was with him.

10:20.636 --> 10:22.635
I'll have uniforms circulate
the sketch around the studio,

10:22.636 --> 10:24.084
see if anybody recognizes him.

10:24.085 --> 10:26.103
Okay, so if Odette
had straightened up

10:26.104 --> 10:27.358
after the train accident,

10:27.359 --> 10:28.783
what was she doing
behind the stage door

10:28.784 --> 10:30.751
secretly giving some
guy a roll of bills?

10:30.752 --> 10:31.795
Could be a drug deal.

10:31.796 --> 10:33.913
Maybe Odette was falling
back into old habits.

10:33.914 --> 10:35.594
Any recent withdrawals
in her bank statement?

10:35.595 --> 10:38.495
Yeah, not for that amount
of money, but check out...

10:38.652 --> 10:40.579
these credit card payments.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.207
For the last six months,
Odette's credit card spending

10:43.208 --> 10:45.277
was pretty much steady, and
then about a month ago,

10:45.278 --> 10:46.730
it suddenly shot up.

10:46.731 --> 10:48.617
No kidding.
Her cards were maxed out.

10:48.618 --> 10:50.407
Over 100 grand in charges?

10:50.408 --> 10:52.297
What was she spending
all that money on?

10:52.298 --> 10:54.287
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Lynchberg.

10:54.288 --> 10:56.404
You were Odette's
business manager

10:56.405 --> 10:58.808
as well as the executor of
her grandfather's estate?

10:58.809 --> 11:01.772
And now I have the
unfortunate task

11:01.773 --> 11:03.589
of handling Odette's
estate as well.

11:03.590 --> 11:06.186
And who inherits her share
of the family trust?

11:06.187 --> 11:09.485
Per Odette's wishes, it goes to
the Graham Morton Foundation.

11:09.486 --> 11:11.592
It's a charitable organization.

11:11.701 --> 11:13.422
You know, I noticed
a pretty big spike

11:13.423 --> 11:14.896
in her spending over
the last month.

11:14.897 --> 11:17.182
- Do you have any idea what that was about?
- I'm sure you know

11:17.183 --> 11:19.826
that after Odette's grandfather
passed away three years ago,

11:19.827 --> 11:22.027
she went through a bad period.

11:22.028 --> 11:23.311
Yeah, her brother filled us in--

11:23.312 --> 11:24.497
parties, drugs.

11:24.498 --> 11:26.712
Of particular concern
to me during that time

11:26.713 --> 11:27.751
was her spending.

11:27.752 --> 11:31.245
Odette would get drunk and
spontaneously buy a car

11:31.246 --> 11:34.006
or put a bid down
on a new apartment.

11:34.007 --> 11:35.707
She paid for her
friend's nose job--

11:35.708 --> 11:37.627
just whatever struck her fancy.

11:37.628 --> 11:39.778
But then after the train
accident last year,

11:39.779 --> 11:41.127
all that stopped.

11:41.128 --> 11:44.828
It was, uh, refreshing to those
of us who cared about her.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.672
I was worried that last
month's credit card charges

11:47.673 --> 11:50.054
indicated that she might
have been backsliding.

11:50.099 --> 11:51.673
What was she buying?

11:51.932 --> 11:53.463
Clothing mostly.

11:53.464 --> 11:55.634
The bulk of the charges
were over two days

11:55.635 --> 11:58.031
at one particular 5th Avenue
department store.

11:58.032 --> 12:00.006
I'd like to see the
original receipts.

12:00.007 --> 12:00.972
Of course.

12:00.973 --> 12:04.147
This is the weirdest spending
spree I have ever seen.

12:04.148 --> 12:06.994
Odette spent tens of thousands
of dollars on clothes,

12:06.995 --> 12:09.240
but nothing in her size
according to these receipts.

12:09.241 --> 12:10.830
Everything's in size 4.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.162
And I went through
her apartment.

12:12.163 --> 12:13.937
I didn't see 100 grand
worth of new clothes.

12:13.938 --> 12:14.883
Maybe she hid 'em.

12:14.884 --> 12:17.358
Sounds to me like the
old gas card scam.

12:17.411 --> 12:18.064
What do you mean?

12:18.065 --> 12:19.831
Your parents put you
on a strict allowance,

12:19.832 --> 12:22.053
but they give you a gas card
so you can fill your car.

12:22.054 --> 12:23.433
Well, you fill
your friends cars,

12:23.434 --> 12:25.418
and they give you cash.

12:25.439 --> 12:27.285
Some of my buddies
in boarding school

12:27.286 --> 12:30.136
- nearly doubled their allowance.
- Uh-huh.

12:30.244 --> 12:31.510
Not me, of course.

12:32.857 --> 12:34.101
That...

12:35.344 --> 12:36.657
Don't tell my mother.

12:36.777 --> 12:38.591
So if Odette needed
cash in a hurry to,

12:38.592 --> 12:40.108
say, maybe pay off some
guy in an alley...

12:40.109 --> 12:42.105
But the monthly stipend
from her family trust

12:42.106 --> 12:42.906
wasn't enough to cover it.

12:42.907 --> 12:45.040
So she charges the clothes,
sells them to her friends,

12:45.041 --> 12:45.766
ends in cash flow.

12:45.767 --> 12:46.809
Which is still not enough.

12:46.810 --> 12:49.086
The card's maxed out,
the money train stops,

12:49.087 --> 12:51.313
and she can't make payment
to whoever she owes.

12:51.314 --> 12:52.527
She ends up dead.

12:52.528 --> 12:54.681
Yeah, but do you guys think
that Odette actually had

12:54.682 --> 12:56.041
one size 4 friend

12:56.042 --> 12:59.160
willing to pay 100 grand for
a bunch of pegged jeans

12:59.161 --> 13:02.136
and a faux rabbit purse?

13:02.682 --> 13:04.039
Did you say rabbit?

13:06.318 --> 13:07.649
Jasmine.

13:08.302 --> 13:09.639
We need to talk.

13:12.181 --> 13:13.382
Where'd you get the bag?

13:13.383 --> 13:14.216
A friend gave it to me.

13:14.217 --> 13:16.055
Your friend Odette Morton?

13:16.417 --> 13:17.873
We talked to the
salesperson, Jasmine.

13:17.874 --> 13:19.086
She said that you
were with Odette

13:19.087 --> 13:21.558
when she dropped 100 grand
on clothes for you.

13:21.559 --> 13:22.753
Odette was very generous.

13:22.754 --> 13:23.994
She's also very dead,

13:23.995 --> 13:26.133
and I know a blackmail
scheme when I hear one.

13:26.134 --> 13:27.997
Maybe Odette had something
going on in her life

13:27.998 --> 13:29.197
she wanted to keep secret.

13:29.198 --> 13:30.644
You found out about
it and told her

13:30.645 --> 13:33.070
that the price for your silence
was a closet full of fancy duds.

13:33.071 --> 13:34.103
But why would I kill her?

13:34.104 --> 13:36.554
Maybe she couldn't give
anymore, you got frustrated,

13:36.555 --> 13:37.196
you killed her.

13:37.197 --> 13:38.915
Maybe she decided to
come forward herself,

13:38.916 --> 13:39.912
accuse you of blackmail,

13:39.913 --> 13:40.632
you killed her.

13:40.633 --> 13:42.389
Jasmine, these are just
off the top of my head.

13:42.390 --> 13:44.403
We can finish off this conversation
at the precinct.

13:44.443 --> 13:45.325
Wait.

13:48.940 --> 13:50.747
Last month, I was
here working late,

13:50.748 --> 13:53.106
and I happened to see Odette
walk by my desk real fast,

13:53.107 --> 13:54.592
like she was upset.
Next thing I know,

13:54.593 --> 13:56.850
here comes Brad Melville,
like he's looking for her.

13:56.851 --> 13:58.945
Brad Melville, the show's host?

13:58.946 --> 14:00.503
Why would the host of
"A Night Of Dance"

14:00.504 --> 14:01.602
be looking for a contestant?

14:01.603 --> 14:02.828
Aren't they not
supposed to fraternize?

14:02.829 --> 14:04.287
That's why I followed him.

14:04.288 --> 14:06.247
Brad and Odette were in the
stairwell having a fight.

14:06.248 --> 14:06.982
About what?

14:06.983 --> 14:08.416
I'm not completely sure.

14:08.417 --> 14:09.519
But when I bluffed Odette

14:09.520 --> 14:11.239
that I was going to tell
Max about her and Brad,

14:11.240 --> 14:12.169
she got really nervous.

14:12.170 --> 14:15.159
She offered to buy me some stuff
I wanted if I'd keep quiet.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.949
And I thought that sounded
like a good deal.

14:16.950 --> 14:19.497
But that's it.
I would've never hurt Odette.

14:19.498 --> 14:22.259
You'll have to pardon me if I
don't take you at your word.

14:22.260 --> 14:24.330
Look, if anyone had a
reason to murder Odette,

14:24.331 --> 14:25.035
it was Brad.

14:25.036 --> 14:27.574
Just listen.
I recorded the two of them.

14:29.199 --> 14:29.971
We had a deal.

14:29.972 --> 14:31.824
And I'm willing to stand
by it if you are.

14:31.825 --> 14:33.639
I have worked too hard
to get where I am.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.301
If anyone finds out
about this, Odette,

14:35.302 --> 14:36.996
I swear, I'll kill you.

14:38.689 --> 14:40.725
If Max Renfro found out
that Brad Melville

14:40.726 --> 14:42.456
was in a relationship with
one of the contestants,

14:42.457 --> 14:43.106
what would happen?

14:43.107 --> 14:44.583
She'd be thrown off the show,

14:44.584 --> 14:46.131
and he'd be fired.

14:46.144 --> 14:48.261
Motive for murder, anyone?

14:49.825 --> 14:51.266
If anyone finds out
about this, Odette,

14:51.267 --> 14:52.860
I swear, I'll kill you.

14:53.011 --> 14:54.748
That is completely not
what it sounds like.

14:54.749 --> 14:56.661
What it sounds like,
Brad, is you threatening

14:56.662 --> 14:59.075
Odette Morton's life a few
weeks before she was murdered.

14:59.076 --> 15:00.715
But I was trying to protect her.

15:00.716 --> 15:02.204
Protect her how?

15:02.836 --> 15:04.782
I knew about Odette's
troubled past--

15:04.783 --> 15:06.341
the drugs, the DUIs.

15:06.342 --> 15:08.770
But I also believed her when
she said she was clean now

15:08.771 --> 15:10.579
and that dancing was
all she cared about.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.227
Are you trying to say
that that wasn't true?

15:12.228 --> 15:13.666
What I'm trying to say is,

15:13.667 --> 15:16.286
two months ago, I walked into
makeup early one morning,

15:16.287 --> 15:18.404
and found Odette shooting up.

15:20.727 --> 15:21.610
Are you sure about this?

15:21.611 --> 15:23.262
100% positive.

15:23.263 --> 15:24.708
If Max knew she was using,

15:24.709 --> 15:26.343
she would've been
eliminated on the spot.

15:26.344 --> 15:27.995
But you never told Max.

15:27.996 --> 15:29.687
Odette promised she
would clean up.

15:29.688 --> 15:33.003
I gave her a second chance, but
I also kept an eye on her.

15:33.004 --> 15:34.978
Then a month ago, I
caught her again.

15:34.979 --> 15:37.722
I told her I was going to Max,
that she was on her own.

15:37.723 --> 15:38.346
And did you?

15:38.347 --> 15:41.152
No, because Odette
threatened me.

15:41.153 --> 15:43.865
She said that if I went to Max
and told him what I'd seen,

15:43.866 --> 15:45.914
that she'd go to him and
tell him that I was the one

15:45.915 --> 15:47.430
that let her off the first time.

15:47.431 --> 15:48.699
Max would've fired me

15:48.700 --> 15:50.481
for keeping a secret
that big from him.

15:50.482 --> 15:51.975
I'd be off the show.

15:51.976 --> 15:54.091
I'd be Brian Dunkleman.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.034
Who's Brian Dunkleman?

15:56.035 --> 15:57.290
Exactly.

15:57.371 --> 16:00.751
So... if Odette went down,
she was taking you with her.

16:02.079 --> 16:03.619
Brad was right about
her shooting up.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.317
Found these hidden
in a false bottom

16:05.318 --> 16:07.311
underneath her jewelry box.
No wonder CSU missed it

16:07.312 --> 16:09.165
- when they went through her apartment.
- Could be speed.

16:09.166 --> 16:11.048
Yeah, except I just got
off the phone with Lanie,

16:11.049 --> 16:13.370
and she said that preliminary
tox screen results show

16:13.371 --> 16:14.775
that Odette wasn't using drugs,

16:14.776 --> 16:17.752
at least none of the usual ones.

16:18.804 --> 16:20.976
So what the hell
is in this bottle?

16:28.067 --> 16:31.546
And so I said to Sir
Laurence, "Larry, that is

16:31.547 --> 16:35.017
"the second best performance
of 'Othello' I have ever seen.

16:35.018 --> 16:37.154
"But I'm afraid no
one can improve

16:37.155 --> 16:39.510
the Orson Welles
interpretation."

16:39.511 --> 16:40.643
"Larry," I said,

16:40.644 --> 16:42.560
"you've simply been outdone."

16:43.861 --> 16:45.769
Wow. What did, uh,
Olivier say to that?

16:45.770 --> 16:46.727
He said...

16:46.728 --> 16:48.069
"My dear girl,

16:48.209 --> 16:50.970
you have the makings
of a theater critic."

16:51.488 --> 16:53.184
And so here I am.

16:53.185 --> 16:55.310
Yes, indeed, you are.

16:55.311 --> 16:56.343
Oh, by the way,

16:56.344 --> 16:59.591
I don't know if I told
you that recently,

16:59.592 --> 17:03.499
I opened my own acting school.

17:03.910 --> 17:05.076
Martha.

17:05.077 --> 17:06.698
How wonderful.

17:06.699 --> 17:07.614
Thank you.

17:07.615 --> 17:09.054
How good of you to share

17:09.055 --> 17:12.546
your years and...
years of experience

17:12.547 --> 17:14.405
with a new generation.

17:15.167 --> 17:17.512
Yes, we are very proud.

17:17.597 --> 17:18.467
And I was wondering,

17:18.468 --> 17:20.655
perhaps you might
consider stopping by

17:20.656 --> 17:22.743
and sitting in on
a class or two,

17:22.744 --> 17:24.832
and then if you
felt so inclined,

17:24.833 --> 17:27.454
mentioning our little school

17:27.455 --> 17:30.487
in one of your
wonderful columns.

17:31.019 --> 17:32.585
I'd be happy to do that.

17:32.586 --> 17:34.848
You just tell me where and when.

17:34.849 --> 17:36.932
Well, that's lovely.

17:37.713 --> 17:40.224
I just hope you're not
teaching your students

17:40.225 --> 17:41.985
your little trick of
tilting your head

17:41.986 --> 17:45.183
before delivering an
important line of dialogue.

17:45.942 --> 17:47.045
I don't do that.

17:47.046 --> 17:49.533
Well, you did it when you
played Maggie The Cat.

17:49.692 --> 17:52.709
Oh, and you fluttered your
hands like little bird wings.

17:52.710 --> 17:55.436
I kept waiting for
you to take off.

17:56.436 --> 17:57.509
Who wants pie?

17:57.510 --> 17:58.385
- Alexis, would you--
- Mm-hmm.

17:58.386 --> 17:59.657
Thank you.

17:59.658 --> 18:02.027
I believe that was the year

18:02.028 --> 18:04.375
that I was nominated for a Tony.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.348
Well, perhaps the
american theatre wing

18:06.349 --> 18:09.009
is more tolerant of head tilting

18:09.010 --> 18:11.422
and hand fluttering than I am.

18:12.084 --> 18:14.956
Oh, Martha, I'm just teasing.

18:15.034 --> 18:18.892
You can't possibly still be
upset about that old review.

18:19.284 --> 18:21.574
Let's not say anything
we'll regret.

18:21.824 --> 18:24.268
That was no review.
That was a hatchet job.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.725
It was vicious and
it was uncalled for.

18:26.726 --> 18:29.522
And it was also accurate.

18:32.116 --> 18:35.099
You know what, Oona?
I rescind my request.

18:35.100 --> 18:37.538
There is no way I would
accept your endorsement

18:37.539 --> 18:40.220
of my school now
if you begged me.

18:40.221 --> 18:42.040
Fat chance of that.

18:43.246 --> 18:45.077
Just remember, Martha,

18:45.107 --> 18:48.322
those who can't do teach.

18:49.870 --> 18:51.754
And those who can't teach

18:51.755 --> 18:53.693
become theater critics.

18:58.396 --> 18:59.639
Gram.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.827
Could've been worse.

19:05.005 --> 19:05.980
It couldn't have been worse.

19:05.981 --> 19:07.533
My mother exposed
her gooey center,

19:07.534 --> 19:09.390
and Oona Marconi drove
a stake through it.

19:09.391 --> 19:10.760
Well, tell her, I feel her pain.

19:10.761 --> 19:13.011
Thanks. I will.
Anything new on the case?

19:13.012 --> 19:14.600
Yeah, unis found the cafe

19:14.601 --> 19:16.195
that Odette went to at 11:00 a.m.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.550
The day that she was killed.

19:17.551 --> 19:19.042
Scoring drugs off
her mystery man?

19:19.043 --> 19:22.330
More like scoring
a fat-free latte.

19:22.331 --> 19:25.140
She met up with a
friend for coffee.

19:25.529 --> 19:26.567
Suzanne Steiner.

19:26.568 --> 19:27.752
A friend?

19:27.753 --> 19:30.323
Leaving the studio on show
day was a very big deal.

19:30.324 --> 19:31.910
What was so important
that it couldn't wait?

19:31.911 --> 19:34.115
According to Suzanne, she just
wanted to talk about old times.

19:34.116 --> 19:35.773
Hey, we got a fax from the lab.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.603
That clear vial of liquid

19:37.604 --> 19:39.092
that we found at
Odette's apartment?

19:39.093 --> 19:40.215
It wasn't illegal drugs.

19:40.216 --> 19:41.358
It's insulin.

19:41.359 --> 19:42.319
Odette was diabetic?

19:42.320 --> 19:43.617
Not according to her doctor.

19:43.618 --> 19:45.452
He said he hasn't seen
her in over a year.

19:45.453 --> 19:47.129
Well, maybe she
developed it recently

19:47.130 --> 19:48.576
or maybe she went
to a new doctor.

19:48.577 --> 19:50.365
Then why not just tell
Brad Melville the truth,

19:50.366 --> 19:52.256
that it wasn't speed,
it was insulin?

19:52.257 --> 19:55.306
And why bother buying
Jasmine half of 5th Avenue

19:55.307 --> 19:56.609
to keep it quiet?

19:58.070 --> 19:59.361
Well, I think I can
help with that.

19:59.362 --> 20:01.424
CSU report is back
on Odette's place.

20:01.425 --> 20:02.877
They only found
one set of prints

20:02.878 --> 20:05.042
and they were not Odette's.

20:05.254 --> 20:07.646
They belong to a woman
named Barbra Landau.

20:07.647 --> 20:09.176
Who the hell is Barbra Landau?

20:09.177 --> 20:11.243
Not someone who would run
in Odette's circles.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.116
She was raised in foster care

20:13.117 --> 20:14.145
and was a high school dropout.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.840
So she was staying with Odette?

20:15.841 --> 20:18.083
- We need to talk to her.
- That's gonna be tough.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.878
Officially, Barbra Landau has
been dead for over a year.

20:20.879 --> 20:22.503
Here's her death certificate.

20:22.666 --> 20:24.106
She died of blunt force trauma

20:24.107 --> 20:26.392
from injuries suffered
in a train collision.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.109
That's right.

20:27.110 --> 20:30.308
The same train collision
that Odette survived.

20:31.117 --> 20:32.641
Or did she?

20:32.642 --> 20:34.313
You see that picture of Odette?

20:34.573 --> 20:35.963
Well, this...

20:36.857 --> 20:38.164
is Barbra.

20:40.274 --> 20:41.340
They're identical.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.694
But that's impossible.

20:42.695 --> 20:43.671
Impossible

20:43.672 --> 20:46.153
or the explanation
to everything?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.879
The dramatic change in
Odette after the accident,

20:48.880 --> 20:50.925
the need to hide
being a diabetic,

20:50.926 --> 20:53.445
because Odette was
not a diabetic...

20:54.006 --> 20:56.367
Odette Morton didn't
survive that train crash.

20:56.368 --> 20:57.520
Barbra did.

20:57.521 --> 20:59.584
And like a phoenix
rising from the ashes,

20:59.585 --> 21:02.155
Barbra Landau walked away from
the wreckage of that train

21:02.156 --> 21:05.310
and stole Odette Morton's life.

21:11.608 --> 21:14.452
Twin girls are born and
put up for adoption.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.894
Odette goes to a wealthy,
loving family.

21:16.895 --> 21:18.763
Barbra--not so lucky.

21:18.764 --> 21:21.152
She gets bounced around from
one foster home to the next,

21:21.153 --> 21:22.865
always knowing deep inside

21:22.866 --> 21:24.817
that she was meant for
something better.

21:24.818 --> 21:28.920
Then one day, the two of them
meet on a train bound for Miami.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.582
The connection is instantaneous.

21:30.583 --> 21:32.935
In two days, they learn everything
there is to know about each other,

21:32.936 --> 21:34.105
and Barbra can't help but think,

21:34.106 --> 21:37.851
if only I had landed in the
lap of luxury like Odette,

21:37.852 --> 21:39.856
I could've been anything
I wanted to be.

21:40.607 --> 21:41.589
Are you suggesting that Barbra

21:41.590 --> 21:43.698
purposefully caused
the derailment

21:43.699 --> 21:45.285
to take over Odette's life?

21:45.286 --> 21:47.672
With what, her crazy
wiccan powers?

21:49.139 --> 21:50.938
Wow, that would be
an incredible twist,

21:50.939 --> 21:52.211
but no, no.

21:52.212 --> 21:53.521
The accident happens.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.301
Odette is killed.

21:55.302 --> 21:56.607
Barbra survives.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.625
And in the midst of all
the chaos and rubble,

21:59.626 --> 22:01.977
she sees her chance.

22:02.315 --> 22:04.613
She switches identification
with Odette,

22:04.614 --> 22:06.527
and she changes her destiny.

22:06.528 --> 22:09.209
In one move, Barbra
builds herself

22:09.210 --> 22:12.224
a better future, a perfect life.

22:12.637 --> 22:14.030
Until she was murdered
a year later.

22:14.031 --> 22:16.785
Yeah, well, separated twin
stories never end happily,

22:17.188 --> 22:18.803
except "the parent trap."

22:18.804 --> 22:19.844
Blood tests are back.

22:19.845 --> 22:21.178
Odette and Barbra

22:21.179 --> 22:23.069
were not biologically related.

22:23.070 --> 22:25.291
And Barbra has no living
family we could find.

22:25.292 --> 22:26.853
If they're not related,

22:26.854 --> 22:28.856
how can Barbra look
so much like Odette?

22:28.857 --> 22:29.524
I don't know.

22:29.525 --> 22:32.644
But we do have an address for
her former place of employment,

22:32.645 --> 22:33.667
a strip club in midtown.

22:33.668 --> 22:35.180
See, we've been operating
under the theory

22:35.181 --> 22:37.484
that Odette was murdered
because she was Odette.

22:37.485 --> 22:39.848
But what if she was murdered
because she was really Barbra?

22:39.849 --> 22:41.836
Find out everything
you can about Barbra.

22:41.837 --> 22:42.631
In the meantime,

22:42.632 --> 22:45.153
I'm gonna reinterview
Odette's brother Paul.

22:45.154 --> 22:46.316
Is he a person of interest now?

22:46.317 --> 22:48.892
I'm just having trouble
believing that Barbra managed

22:48.893 --> 22:51.496
to fool Odette's own
brother for over a year.

22:51.497 --> 22:53.556
He's gonna have to convince
me that he didn't know.

22:53.557 --> 22:55.762
Well, that sounds like
something better done

22:55.763 --> 22:57.197
one-on-one, mano a mano.

22:57.198 --> 22:59.299
Meantime, I want to take a
ride downtown with the boys,

22:59.300 --> 23:01.172
- check out that strip club.
- Sorry, Castle.

23:01.173 --> 23:02.527
Three's a crowd.

23:07.461 --> 23:08.832
What's up? Why you freezing
out our boy like that?

23:08.833 --> 23:10.041
I want to try an experiment.

23:10.042 --> 23:12.203
Having Castle along
would mess things up.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.615
Here.

23:15.381 --> 23:16.147
Wear my wedding ring.

23:16.148 --> 23:18.395
What? Get that thing
away from me, man.

23:18.508 --> 23:19.098
It's a mood killer.

23:19.099 --> 23:20.317
Just wear it when
we're at the club.

23:20.318 --> 23:20.920
What for?

23:20.921 --> 23:22.443
See, I been talking to all
my married guy friends,

23:22.444 --> 23:24.479
they say that your
theory is way off.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.780
Wearing a wedding ring

23:25.781 --> 23:28.010
gets them more attention
from women, not less.

23:28.011 --> 23:30.509
- So?
- So wear the ring.

23:30.864 --> 23:32.624
I want to see if women
still flirt with you

23:32.625 --> 23:34.027
and ignore me.

23:34.792 --> 23:36.144
So you didn't want Castle
to come because...

23:36.145 --> 23:37.951
All the women would
flirt with him.

23:39.086 --> 23:40.195
I want to know if
it's just the ring

23:40.196 --> 23:41.809
that's repelling members
of the fairer sex.

23:41.810 --> 23:44.536
It's not the ring, bro.
It's you.

23:44.838 --> 23:46.257
See, once you've been
married for a little while

23:46.258 --> 23:48.762
and you're feeling a little
bored and unsatisfied,

23:48.763 --> 23:51.385
the ring will get you
love from the ladies.

23:51.386 --> 23:52.985
They'll want to take
you away from all that

23:52.986 --> 23:55.092
so that you can be bored
and unsatisfied with them.

23:55.093 --> 23:56.405
Why not now?

23:56.776 --> 23:58.776
'Cause now you're all
blissfully happy

23:58.777 --> 24:00.479
with your wife and whatnot.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.683
You have the stink of
honeymoon phase all over you.

24:03.684 --> 24:05.596
No woman wants to
be around that.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.049
How long does it last?

24:07.389 --> 24:09.198
Well, it's hard to say.

24:09.532 --> 24:10.954
But knowing you and Jenny,

24:10.955 --> 24:12.372
probably forever.

24:23.209 --> 24:24.850
Oh, yeah, Barbie.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.992
All she wanted was to be
a dancer on Broadway.

24:27.993 --> 24:29.876
She used to talk
about it a lot, huh?

24:29.877 --> 24:30.959
More than that.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.625
She got a makeover,
changed her hair,

24:33.626 --> 24:35.888
and then two years ago,
she got her nose done

24:35.889 --> 24:38.039
even though her nose
looked fine before.

24:39.273 --> 24:41.070
Back in the day, did Barbra
have trouble with anybody,

24:41.071 --> 24:43.211
say a customer,
maybe a boyfriend?

24:43.212 --> 24:46.285
Boyfriend, yeah. Jason.

24:46.961 --> 24:48.140
Could this be him?

24:48.141 --> 24:49.380
That's him.

24:49.381 --> 24:51.068
Jason Bagwell.

24:51.069 --> 24:52.602
Do you know where
we can find Jason?

24:52.603 --> 24:55.187
He lived over in Alphabet City.

24:55.211 --> 24:57.320
He was always running some scam,

24:57.353 --> 25:00.341
borrowing money from Barbra
for some new business venture

25:00.342 --> 25:01.951
and never paying her back.

25:01.952 --> 25:03.763
But she loved him.

25:03.764 --> 25:05.173
Crazy love, you know?

25:05.174 --> 25:07.042
Oh, yeah. I do.

25:07.595 --> 25:09.598
Well, you've been very
helpful, Shantell.

25:09.599 --> 25:10.987
Thank you for your time.

25:10.988 --> 25:12.836
If you wanted, you
could come back later.

25:12.837 --> 25:14.385
My show starts at 8:00.

25:14.386 --> 25:14.998
I could probably--

25:14.999 --> 25:17.050
He's gotta get home to the
little woman, Shantell,

25:17.051 --> 25:20.671
but we do thank you for your
time and your cooperation.

25:20.672 --> 25:21.664
All right.

25:25.195 --> 25:26.616
What's wrong with you, man?

25:26.617 --> 25:27.976
Why you gotta throw salt
in my game like that?

25:27.977 --> 25:29.006
You can't pick up on honeys

25:29.007 --> 25:30.218
while wearing the eternal symbol

25:30.219 --> 25:31.987
of my love and
commitment to Jenny.

25:33.172 --> 25:35.040
- Did I just say that out loud?
- Mm-hmm.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.951
No wonder women won't
flirt with me.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.153
I'm a lost cause,

25:38.154 --> 25:40.147
a man in love with his wife.

25:40.841 --> 25:41.989
Enjoy it, my friend.

25:41.990 --> 25:44.333
A lot of men would
switch places with you.

25:45.053 --> 25:47.608
Not me. Mnh-mnh. Other men.

25:47.609 --> 25:49.418
Guys. Unhappy single guys.

25:49.419 --> 25:50.769
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just give me my ring back,

25:50.770 --> 25:52.243
and you can go get
Shantell's phone number.

25:52.244 --> 25:53.458
You're next up.

25:56.336 --> 25:58.989
What the... ow.

25:58.990 --> 25:59.863
What?

26:01.014 --> 26:02.381
It's stuck.

26:04.374 --> 26:06.848
The guys are out picking
up Barbra's ex-boyfriend.

26:06.849 --> 26:08.506
I thought I'd use the
time to follow up

26:08.507 --> 26:10.053
on what they learned
at the club.

26:10.054 --> 26:12.754
Starting with the fact
that Barbra Landau

26:12.755 --> 26:14.513
did get plastic surgery.

26:14.514 --> 26:16.357
Here is her old DMV photo.

26:16.358 --> 26:17.923
- She's a pretty girl.
- Exactly.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.019
Plastic surgery didn't make
her look more beautiful.

26:20.020 --> 26:23.499
It just made her look
more like Odette Morton.

26:23.901 --> 26:26.039
You remember her accountant
Samuel Lynchberg told you

26:26.040 --> 26:28.281
that Odette paid for
her friend's nose job?

26:28.282 --> 26:29.928
And you think Barbra
is that friend?

26:29.929 --> 26:31.183
You think they knew each other?

26:31.184 --> 26:31.818
I know it.

26:31.819 --> 26:33.100
Lynchberg's assistant
confirmed it.

26:33.101 --> 26:35.878
Odette paid for Barbra's
surgery plus expenses.

26:35.879 --> 26:38.375
And I'm guessing you
have a theory as to why.

26:38.603 --> 26:40.605
You know Odette loved to party.

26:40.606 --> 26:41.897
Speaking from
personal experience,

26:41.898 --> 26:44.552
I can tell you that all
that constant carousing

26:44.553 --> 26:46.746
does not come without
consequences,

26:46.747 --> 26:49.623
like arrests, community
service hours,

26:49.624 --> 26:51.152
waking up in a
strange hotel room

26:51.153 --> 26:53.752
with some girl's panties on your head.
That's...

26:54.353 --> 26:55.731
Forget that part.

26:55.732 --> 26:58.858
Here is Odette doing her
community service hours

26:58.859 --> 27:01.199
for her second DUI in 2010.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.045
Here's Odette at a bridal
shower with friends.

27:04.998 --> 27:05.616
So?

27:05.617 --> 27:06.878
So according to the time stamps,

27:06.879 --> 27:08.347
these photos were
taken on the same day

27:08.348 --> 27:10.341
within 20 minutes of each other.

27:10.342 --> 27:12.886
So it was really Barbra
at the soup kitchen.

27:12.887 --> 27:14.255
Odette would do the crime,

27:14.256 --> 27:16.292
but she didn't want
to do the time.

27:16.293 --> 27:19.527
So she created a Faux-Dette
to do her dirty work for her.

27:19.528 --> 27:21.944
A job that I bet paid very well.

27:21.945 --> 27:23.528
Maybe a wild night on the town

27:23.529 --> 27:25.155
brings Odette to the strip club,

27:25.156 --> 27:26.975
where she sees Barbra--

27:26.976 --> 27:28.255
all of Barbra--

27:28.256 --> 27:29.443
and she realizes,

27:29.444 --> 27:30.584
with a little work,

27:30.585 --> 27:33.259
Barbra could be the
perfect double for her,

27:33.260 --> 27:34.786
doing all the unpleasant jobs

27:34.787 --> 27:37.043
that Odette simply couldn't
be bothered to do--

27:37.044 --> 27:39.006
community service
hours, drug tests--

27:39.007 --> 27:41.045
And with a little training
and some surgical tweaks,

27:41.046 --> 27:42.410
Barbra could do even more,

27:42.411 --> 27:44.280
like meetings with
Odette's business manager

27:44.281 --> 27:46.524
or boring luncheons
with her aunt Margaret.

27:46.525 --> 27:48.900
Nobody in Odette's inner circle
could've known about the ruse,

27:48.901 --> 27:50.198
so that when the train crashed,

27:50.199 --> 27:53.276
Barbra saw her chance to go from
understudy to leading lady,

27:53.277 --> 27:54.927
- and she took it.
- Okay, so that explains the transition,

27:54.928 --> 27:56.515
but we still don't
know who killed her.

27:56.516 --> 27:57.858
Maybe we do.

27:57.859 --> 27:59.841
It would have to be
someone that knew

27:59.842 --> 28:03.118
Odette was actually Barbra
when he saw her on TV,

28:03.119 --> 28:04.297
someone who was looking

28:04.298 --> 28:06.349
to cash in on her new life...

28:06.350 --> 28:08.775
Someone like Barbra's
boyfriend Jason.

28:10.221 --> 28:13.232
I'm telling you, this is crazy.
I didn't kill anybody.

28:13.671 --> 28:15.783
Here's what I think happened--

28:15.784 --> 28:17.942
you realized that
Barbra didn't die

28:17.943 --> 28:19.481
in that train accident.

28:19.482 --> 28:20.596
She was alive.

28:20.597 --> 28:22.910
And living as Odette Morton,
which meant she was very rich.

28:22.911 --> 28:25.364
You knew her secret, and you
wanted to be rich, too.

28:25.365 --> 28:26.266
But Barbra wasn't
the kind of girl

28:26.267 --> 28:27.644
to claw her way
into the good life

28:27.645 --> 28:29.935
and then be taken advantage
of by the likes of you.

28:29.936 --> 28:31.867
She rejected you, and
so you shot her.

28:31.868 --> 28:34.584
See, this--this is why
I didn't come forward.

28:34.585 --> 28:36.036
I knew you'd suspect me.

28:36.037 --> 28:39.027
We suspect people
with motive, Jason.

28:39.486 --> 28:40.437
You've got it wrong.

28:40.438 --> 28:42.175
Barbra came to me.

28:42.176 --> 28:44.890
Two weeks ago, she
showed up on my doorstep

28:44.891 --> 28:46.157
and told me the whole story.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.909
Barbra had everything
she could want--

28:47.910 --> 28:49.579
a perfect life.

28:49.580 --> 28:53.042
Why would she risk it all by
getting in touch with you?

28:54.426 --> 28:56.514
Because she missed me.

28:57.889 --> 29:00.823
And Odette's life
wasn't as perfect

29:00.824 --> 29:03.017
as Barbra thought.

29:03.018 --> 29:04.195
Barbra was lonely,

29:04.196 --> 29:06.424
and she wanted to
get back together.

29:06.425 --> 29:08.610
She told me she had found out
some stuff about Odette,

29:08.611 --> 29:10.658
um, secrets from her past.

29:10.659 --> 29:12.293
- What kind of secrets?
- I don't know.

29:12.294 --> 29:14.035
But she said, if
anyone found out,

29:14.036 --> 29:15.865
it would all be over for her.

29:17.122 --> 29:19.421
You think this secret
got her killed?

29:19.422 --> 29:21.925
She said she could use
it to her advantage.

29:23.262 --> 29:24.705
She just needed
more information.

29:24.706 --> 29:26.626
Information was-- was leverage,

29:26.627 --> 29:28.176
it would protect her,

29:28.177 --> 29:30.046
but she had to move fast.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.796
And she didn't move fast enough.

29:33.797 --> 29:36.065
Barbra had been dancing
since she was a little kid,

29:36.066 --> 29:39.696
and all she ever wanted was
to be a star on Broadway.

29:41.670 --> 29:43.627
And she was so close.

29:43.628 --> 29:45.543
So it wasn't something
from her own past

29:45.544 --> 29:47.051
that got Barbra killed.

29:47.556 --> 29:49.391
It was something from Odette's.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.233
Okay, so a week
before her death,

29:57.234 --> 29:59.946
Barbra, as Odette,
is acting odd,

29:59.947 --> 30:01.269
she's missing rehearsals--

30:01.270 --> 30:02.422
She seeks out her ex,

30:02.423 --> 30:05.124
tells him that Odette's
perfect life isn't so perfect

30:05.125 --> 30:06.641
and that there's something
in Odette's past

30:06.642 --> 30:07.494
- that's a problem.
- Right.

30:07.495 --> 30:10.651
So she needs information.
So where does she go?

30:11.184 --> 30:12.191
Suzanne Steiner.

30:12.192 --> 30:13.953
Remember, Barbra met her for
coffee the day she died?

30:13.954 --> 30:16.127
She wanted to talk to
Suzanne about old times.

30:16.128 --> 30:18.850
I'm not sure what help I can be.

30:19.138 --> 30:21.950
Odette seemed fine the
day that I saw her.

30:21.951 --> 30:22.714
Mm-hmm.

30:22.715 --> 30:25.193
Oh, I keep forgetting
that she wasn't Odette.

30:25.194 --> 30:27.292
Oh, the resemblance
was remarkable.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.236
You said that she
wanted to reminisce.

30:29.237 --> 30:30.833
How close were the two of you?

30:30.834 --> 30:32.613
Well, my dad was the butler
in her grandfather's home

30:32.614 --> 30:34.161
for 20 years, so...

30:34.162 --> 30:35.838
we practically grew up together.

30:35.839 --> 30:37.268
And what did she
want to talk about?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.844
Well, she asked about
her grandfather.

30:38.845 --> 30:40.921
Well, Odette's grandfather.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.652
She talked about how
close they had been.

30:44.553 --> 30:46.871
And then she asked about
the day that he died.

30:47.150 --> 30:48.694
- He died in his sleep, didn't he?
- Yeah.

30:48.695 --> 30:50.503
Yeah, he was 98.

30:51.037 --> 30:52.859
It was odd that she asked,

30:52.860 --> 30:55.037
because I wasn't there,

30:55.038 --> 30:56.688
but she was--

30:56.689 --> 30:59.017
Odette was-- along
with my father,

30:59.018 --> 31:01.317
and when I reminded her of that,

31:01.318 --> 31:03.367
she asked about my dad.

31:03.368 --> 31:06.412
She said she wanted to...
catch up with him.

31:06.815 --> 31:08.529
Do you know if the two
of them ever spoke?

31:08.530 --> 31:09.641
Well, I gave her his number,

31:09.642 --> 31:12.593
but I-I'm not sure
what happened.

31:15.801 --> 31:18.379
Mnh-mnh. It's not coming off.

31:18.380 --> 31:20.356
It's like it soldered
itself onto my hand.

31:20.357 --> 31:21.651
Maybe it's possessed, you know,

31:21.652 --> 31:23.892
like some kind of cursed object
from a Stephen King story.

31:23.893 --> 31:26.155
How can I tell my wife that I'm
not wearing my wedding ring

31:26.156 --> 31:27.946
because I lent it to
Esposito as an experiment

31:27.947 --> 31:29.954
to see if strippers
would flirt with me?

31:31.216 --> 31:33.226
Maybe she'll see
the humor in it.

31:34.092 --> 31:35.364
- Not a chance.
- You're a dead man.

31:35.365 --> 31:36.926
So Charles Carson,

31:36.927 --> 31:39.753
former butler to Odette's
late grandfather.

31:39.754 --> 31:42.296
No record, but get this--

31:42.297 --> 31:44.252
his name rang a bell,
so I looked up

31:44.253 --> 31:46.195
the guest list from
Wednesday's taping,

31:46.196 --> 31:47.721
and he's on it.

31:47.722 --> 31:50.867
Odette called in a last-minute
ticket request for Mr. Carson.

31:50.868 --> 31:51.915
So he was at the show.

31:51.916 --> 31:53.942
Yes, security has him
going through at 2:15,

31:53.943 --> 31:56.518
but after that, no one
remembers seeing him.

31:56.519 --> 31:59.585
Okay, so Suzanne
said that Faux-Dette

31:59.586 --> 32:01.873
wanted to talk about the
day her grandfather died.

32:01.874 --> 32:04.690
What if this was the secret
that Barbra was on to?

32:04.691 --> 32:06.435
What if Graham Morton didn't
die of natural causes

32:06.436 --> 32:08.062
and she felt somehow
Charles Carson here

32:08.063 --> 32:09.381
had something to do with it?

32:09.382 --> 32:12.413
We need to see Graham
Morton's autopsy report.

32:13.077 --> 32:14.883
Based on my reading of
the coroner's report,

32:14.884 --> 32:17.697
I can see why Graham Morton's
death was ruled natural causes.

32:17.698 --> 32:18.509
However--

32:18.510 --> 32:20.153
Ooh. There's a however.

32:20.154 --> 32:22.615
A very big however. Tell 'em.

32:22.616 --> 32:24.906
There were some anomalies
I found suspicious.

32:24.907 --> 32:26.719
Evidence of petechiae
in both eyes,

32:26.720 --> 32:29.002
fresh bruising on the right side
of Mr. Morton's nose,

32:29.003 --> 32:30.998
which could have
happened if, say,

32:30.999 --> 32:33.986
someone was holding a
pillow over his face.

32:33.987 --> 32:36.251
All in all, I think
there's ample evidence

32:36.252 --> 32:38.884
that Mr. Morton was murdered.

32:39.557 --> 32:40.433
Ample.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.206
Murdered.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.056
I am just so proud.

32:44.057 --> 32:46.538
- Dad, work. Boundaries.
- Right.

32:46.539 --> 32:48.474
One more thing.
When I requested the file

32:48.475 --> 32:49.952
be sent over, the clerk told me

32:49.953 --> 32:52.651
that I was the second person
this week to ask for it.

32:52.652 --> 32:55.341
Odette Morton was
there on Tuesday.

32:55.342 --> 32:58.642
So Barbra realized Odette's
grandfather was murdered

32:58.643 --> 32:59.925
and must have thought
Carson the butler

32:59.926 --> 33:00.760
had something to do with it.

33:00.761 --> 33:02.766
And then when Carson figured
out that Barbra knew too much,

33:02.767 --> 33:03.774
he killed her.

33:03.775 --> 33:05.219
We're gonna bring him in
first thing in the morning.

33:05.220 --> 33:07.321
And arrest him for
a double murder.

33:13.174 --> 33:14.075
Good morning.

33:14.076 --> 33:15.824
Speak for yourself.

33:16.103 --> 33:18.952
Oh, Richard. I really messed up.

33:18.953 --> 33:21.417
I just let my ego get
the better of me,

33:21.418 --> 33:24.579
now Oona Marconi is never
gonna endorse my school.

33:24.580 --> 33:26.531
She'll probably write
something negative

33:26.532 --> 33:27.951
just out of spite.

33:27.952 --> 33:30.085
Well, there is a chance you
can still turn this around.

33:30.086 --> 33:32.910
But are you willing to
apologize to someone

33:32.911 --> 33:34.091
who doesn't really deserve it?

33:34.092 --> 33:35.519
Darling, I don't think
a simple apology

33:35.520 --> 33:37.331
is gonna get me out of this.

33:37.332 --> 33:40.457
Then in the wise words
of Don Vito Corleone...

33:41.205 --> 33:42.824
You need to make her an offer

33:42.825 --> 33:44.657
she can't refuse.

33:45.602 --> 33:47.316
And if there's anything--

33:47.317 --> 33:49.070
if there's anything
I can do to help,

33:49.071 --> 33:51.057
- you let me know.
- I will.

33:51.058 --> 33:52.362
I will.

33:56.158 --> 33:58.116
Mr. Carson, you worked
for Graham Morton

33:58.117 --> 33:59.596
for over 25 years.

33:59.597 --> 34:01.370
I understand that you were

34:01.371 --> 34:03.159
very close with his grandkids.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.837
Well, as--as close
as one could be

34:05.838 --> 34:07.179
while still maintaining

34:07.180 --> 34:09.187
the employer-servant
relationship.

34:09.188 --> 34:11.275
So when the victim called
you and invited you

34:11.275 --> 34:13.888
to the "Night Of Dance"
taping on Wednesday,

34:14.168 --> 34:16.471
- you said yes.
- I was delighted.

34:16.472 --> 34:18.550
She asked me to
meet her afterwards

34:18.551 --> 34:20.034
and said that she had
a question for me,

34:20.036 --> 34:22.136
but of course, as you know,
they canceled the show,

34:22.137 --> 34:25.034
and I didn't find out until the
next day what had happened.

34:27.121 --> 34:29.784
I had no idea

34:29.786 --> 34:32.047
that that girl wasn't Odette

34:32.049 --> 34:34.210
and no idea why she
wanted to talk to me.

34:34.210 --> 34:37.982
She wanted to talk to you about
the day that Graham Morton died.

34:39.067 --> 34:40.811
Why would she care about that?

34:40.812 --> 34:41.896
It seems she had some evidence

34:41.897 --> 34:44.697
that Mr. Morton didn't
die of natural causes.

34:46.248 --> 34:48.739
I don't understand.
Are you saying that he was murdered?

34:48.739 --> 34:51.237
You were at the house
that day, weren't you?

34:51.649 --> 34:53.623
Oh, good lord.
You don't think that I had--

34:53.625 --> 34:55.563
You were the person
closest to him.

34:55.563 --> 34:57.317
You had ample opportunity.

34:57.318 --> 34:58.384
We've seen the will.

34:58.385 --> 35:00.269
He left you a generous bequest.

35:01.404 --> 35:04.556
I would never have hurt
Mr. Morton.

35:08.132 --> 35:11.831
But that woman--the woman who
pretended to be Odette--

35:11.832 --> 35:13.356
she might be right
about his death.

35:13.357 --> 35:17.312
In fact, it's possible that she
believed that I knew something.

35:17.313 --> 35:18.653
Tell me,

35:19.113 --> 35:20.889
how did Mr. Morton die?

35:21.395 --> 35:23.010
Was he smothered?

35:24.494 --> 35:26.259
Why would you ask that?

35:26.260 --> 35:29.016
The month he died, there was
tension in the household.

35:29.017 --> 35:30.823
Odette was seeing someone

35:30.824 --> 35:33.202
of whom Mr. Morton
did not approve.

35:33.203 --> 35:33.979
Do you know who?

35:33.980 --> 35:35.964
No, but he ordered
her to break it off,

35:35.965 --> 35:38.406
and of course, that day
Odette was crying,

35:38.407 --> 35:40.563
she spent most of the
morning in her room.

35:40.564 --> 35:44.243
At about 1:00, Mr. Morton said that
he wanted to take a nap,

35:44.244 --> 35:46.680
so I cleared the bed
of all the pillows.

35:46.681 --> 35:48.880
He preferred a-a flat surface.

35:48.881 --> 35:49.798
Now a few moments later,

35:49.799 --> 35:51.537
there was a commotion
down in the kitchen.

35:51.538 --> 35:54.927
Odette had put a sandwich in
the toaster oven too long,

35:54.928 --> 35:56.978
and it had caused a small fire.

35:56.979 --> 35:57.867
We put it out,

35:57.868 --> 36:01.156
and then I went back upstairs
to check on Mr. Morton,

36:01.157 --> 36:02.920
and he was dead.

36:02.921 --> 36:05.960
And that's when I noticed it.

36:05.961 --> 36:07.160
Noticed what?

36:07.161 --> 36:09.502
A pillow on the bed.

36:09.503 --> 36:12.501
And I was sure that I
had taken them all off.

36:12.827 --> 36:14.142
So I told Odette about it,

36:14.143 --> 36:17.245
but she said my mind was
playing tricks on me,

36:17.246 --> 36:18.383
so I let it go.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.018
Mr. Carson, when you
were in the kitchen,

36:20.019 --> 36:23.293
was there ever a moment that
Odette was out of your sight?

36:23.869 --> 36:24.705
No.

36:26.286 --> 36:28.053
I-I knew she was innocent.

36:28.054 --> 36:29.356
She wasn't innocent.

36:29.357 --> 36:30.432
She was the distraction.

36:30.433 --> 36:31.531
Odette got you down
to the kitchen

36:31.532 --> 36:34.244
while her accomplice went and
murdered her grandfather.

36:34.245 --> 36:36.465
And then when Barbra Landau
figured out the truth,

36:36.466 --> 36:38.981
the accomplice
murdered her, too.

36:46.666 --> 36:48.942
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Lynchberg.

36:49.547 --> 36:50.895
Mr. Lynchberg,

36:51.251 --> 36:53.611
being the Morton family
financial advisor,

36:53.612 --> 36:55.233
that must give you
pretty good insight

36:55.234 --> 36:57.417
into their-- their
personal lives, right?

36:57.418 --> 36:59.564
Well, looking at what people
spend their money on,

36:59.565 --> 37:01.638
you get to know
folks pretty well.

37:01.639 --> 37:04.078
And how well did
you know Odette?

37:04.928 --> 37:07.050
As well as any of my clients.

37:07.051 --> 37:09.773
But given the lectures that I
gave her about her lifestyle,

37:09.774 --> 37:10.799
maybe more so.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.586
We understand, about the
time her grandfather died,

37:13.587 --> 37:15.132
Odette was dating someone,

37:15.133 --> 37:17.435
someone her grandfather
didn't approve of.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.257
Mm. Well, that's not surprising.

37:19.258 --> 37:21.028
The two of them rarely
saw eye to eye.

37:21.029 --> 37:23.829
This boyfriend-- do you
remember who he was?

37:24.431 --> 37:25.517
No. Why?

37:25.518 --> 37:27.069
Well, because we think
that he conspired

37:27.070 --> 37:28.676
with Odette to kill
her grandfather

37:28.677 --> 37:30.038
and then he killed Barbra

37:30.039 --> 37:31.904
when she was on the verge
of figuring it all out.

37:31.905 --> 37:33.468
You're sure you don't remember?

37:33.469 --> 37:34.097
Mnh-mnh.

37:34.098 --> 37:35.722
Well, we just spoke
with Odette's brother,

37:35.723 --> 37:37.391
and he remembers.

37:37.664 --> 37:39.846
In fact, he remembers
it being you.

37:40.110 --> 37:42.302
He said that the two of you
wanted to get married,

37:42.303 --> 37:45.331
but Odette's grandfather
threatened to cut her off.

37:45.332 --> 37:46.576
Now a girl like Odette,

37:46.577 --> 37:49.056
she could never be
happy living off

37:49.057 --> 37:51.879
a meager 6-figure
salary like yours.

37:52.681 --> 37:54.424
She needed to inherit.

37:54.425 --> 37:56.089
But that old man refused to die.

37:56.090 --> 37:57.022
So she convinced you

37:57.023 --> 38:00.317
to go upstairs and smother
him to death with a pillow

38:00.318 --> 38:02.378
while she created a
distraction in the kitchen.

38:02.379 --> 38:03.618
Problem solved.

38:03.619 --> 38:05.984
Except once she had her money,

38:05.985 --> 38:08.313
she left you, went back to
her partying lifestyle.

38:08.314 --> 38:11.123
She used you, but there wasn't
anything you could do about it.

38:11.124 --> 38:13.445
At least not without
admitting to the murder.

38:13.446 --> 38:14.462
You can't prove that.

38:14.463 --> 38:16.129
His death wasn't even
ruled a homicide.

38:16.130 --> 38:18.423
No, but Barbra Landau's was.

38:20.955 --> 38:22.907
Uniforms found this 9 millimeter

38:22.908 --> 38:25.198
in the dumpster
behind your offices.

38:25.199 --> 38:26.265
Ballistics match.

38:26.266 --> 38:29.188
This is the same gun that was
used to kill Barbra Landau.

38:29.189 --> 38:30.475
And it's got...

38:30.843 --> 38:33.530
your fingerprints all over it.

38:41.978 --> 38:44.537
Last month, when her credit
card bills were so high,

38:44.538 --> 38:47.498
I thought she was slipping
back into her old ways.

38:47.499 --> 38:48.753
I said to her,

38:48.754 --> 38:50.933
"We didn't risk everything
to get this money

38:50.934 --> 38:53.682
so you could let it
ruin your life."

38:54.479 --> 38:56.122
And she looked at me, and...

38:57.076 --> 38:57.721
I could tell,

38:57.722 --> 38:59.966
she had no idea what
I was talking about.

39:00.626 --> 39:01.271
In that moment,

39:01.272 --> 39:04.221
I knew that she
wasn't my Odette.

39:04.222 --> 39:05.797
And that's how she
got on to you.

39:05.798 --> 39:08.443
So this Barbra told me
that if I kept her secret,

39:08.444 --> 39:09.653
she would keep mine.

39:09.654 --> 39:11.076
She thought we were even.

39:11.077 --> 39:14.254
She thought that she could
just take the place of Odette.

39:15.788 --> 39:17.397
I mean, wh-what-- what
was I supposed to do,

39:17.398 --> 39:19.423
just let some dirty
stripper live in her house

39:19.424 --> 39:22.299
and wear her clothes
and--and blackmail me?

39:22.300 --> 39:23.992
Odette deserved better.

39:40.566 --> 39:41.818
What's going on?

39:41.819 --> 39:42.441
I was just thinking

39:42.442 --> 39:45.413
how we rely on dreams to
keep us going in life

39:45.414 --> 39:46.178
and how sad it is

39:46.179 --> 39:47.892
when they become the
things that tear us down.

39:47.893 --> 39:50.199
Yeah, well, that might be
the case for Barbra Landau,

39:50.200 --> 39:53.134
but not for everyone with
dreams that didn't come true.

39:54.882 --> 39:56.859
I mean, take Lanie for instance.

39:56.860 --> 39:59.734
She wanted to be a dancer.
She became a doctor.

40:00.030 --> 40:01.679
That's not so bad, is it?

40:01.680 --> 40:04.491
Hmm. What about you?

40:04.492 --> 40:05.388
I mean, I know you became a cop

40:05.389 --> 40:06.308
because your mother
was murdered,

40:06.309 --> 40:09.127
but there had to be
something before that.

40:09.128 --> 40:11.653
What did little Kate Beckett
want to be when she grew up?

40:11.654 --> 40:13.511
At Stanford, I was pre-law.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.168
So your dream

40:15.169 --> 40:17.377
was to argue a case
before the supreme court.

40:17.378 --> 40:18.714
Mm-hmm. Yep, I was on my way

40:18.715 --> 40:21.596
to becoming the first
female Chief Justice.

40:21.597 --> 40:23.232
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.469
Not bad.

40:30.581 --> 40:33.695
Ah, it won't-- yeah,
you know what?

40:33.696 --> 40:35.609
I'm late for my
stripper date, man.

40:35.610 --> 40:37.016
Whoa. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

40:37.017 --> 40:39.591
I cannot go home again without
ring on my finger tonight.

40:39.592 --> 40:41.127
Our couch has a loose spring.
My back--

40:41.128 --> 40:42.284
Did you try soap?

40:42.285 --> 40:43.509
Yeah. Yeah, that was, like,
the first thing we did.

40:43.510 --> 40:44.856
Cooking spray?
I didn't think about cooking spray.

40:44.857 --> 40:45.864
Where am I gonna
find cooking spray?

40:45.865 --> 40:46.689
Here.

40:52.397 --> 40:54.108
It's like silk.

40:54.857 --> 40:56.233
That might work.

40:57.467 --> 41:00.546
- Oh, yeah. I think it's coming.
- Yeah?

41:06.821 --> 41:08.488
At least it's off my finger.

41:11.597 --> 41:14.588
Oona, thank you so
much for stopping by.

41:14.589 --> 41:15.840
Thank you, Martha.

41:15.841 --> 41:18.721
And I'll be sure to find a
few inches of column space

41:18.722 --> 41:20.190
to mention your little school.

41:20.191 --> 41:22.800
Oh, good. Thank you.
I really appreciate that dear.

41:22.801 --> 41:23.740
Oh, Richard, good.

41:23.741 --> 41:25.443
You're just in time to
say good-bye to Oona.

41:25.444 --> 41:26.927
Oh. How nice to see you again.

41:26.928 --> 41:28.453
It's lovely to see you as well.

41:28.454 --> 41:31.641
And I, uh, look forward
to hearing from you.

41:31.642 --> 41:32.414
Hearing from--

41:32.415 --> 41:35.008
Well, I know you're in a
hurry, dear, and, uh,

41:35.009 --> 41:36.839
I'll call you.
We will have lunch.

41:36.840 --> 41:38.530
- Yes.
- Bye-bye.

41:40.826 --> 41:43.027
All's well that ends well.

41:43.028 --> 41:44.939
Mother, why would Oona
Marconi be looking forward

41:44.940 --> 41:45.910
to hearing from me?

41:45.911 --> 41:48.609
Well, you did say, if there was
any way that you could help--

41:48.610 --> 41:49.656
That you should let me know.

41:49.657 --> 41:52.888
Exactly what did you promise
her without asking me first?

41:54.222 --> 41:56.031
That you would read her novel...

41:56.032 --> 41:56.858
Oh, mother.

41:56.859 --> 41:59.418
And critique it and give
it to your publisher.

41:59.419 --> 42:01.224
It is the inspiring story

42:01.225 --> 42:03.781
of a young woman's journey
from department store clerk

42:03.782 --> 42:07.026
to world-renowned Broadway star.

42:07.027 --> 42:09.169
Chick lit?
Mother this is really not my--

42:09.170 --> 42:10.271
Oh, and, darling,

42:10.272 --> 42:11.862
when you give her your
thoughts, do be kind,

42:11.863 --> 42:15.424
because it's always been her
dream to be a novelist.

42:18.710 --> 42:20.153
Be kind.

42:21.183 --> 42:22.441
For you, mother,

42:23.470 --> 42:24.940
I can be kind.
