WEBVTT

00:04.613 --> 00:05.875
Alright, just one more beer

00:05.962 --> 00:07.268
and then I need to get home
and help Molly

00:07.355 --> 00:08.878
with last-minute wedding stuff.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.967
What about helping me
with the bachelor party?

00:11.054 --> 00:12.142
I'm tired of you
makin' this whole weddin'

00:12.229 --> 00:14.884
about you and Molly.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.538
Now time for
the tough questions.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.540
Number one, topless or all nude?

00:20.455 --> 00:22.152
Whatever, I just don't
wanna get dragged onstage

00:22.239 --> 00:24.024
by three girls named Cinnamon,
so they can play

00:24.111 --> 00:27.070
Let's-Humiliate-The-Fat-Guy.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.724
Hey, it's not humiliating.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.552
They just take your shirt off,
strap you to a chair

00:30.639 --> 00:32.075
and rub their oily butts
in your face.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.513
Don't read too much into this

00:35.600 --> 00:37.950
but I had a very similar
experience at boy scout camp

00:38.038 --> 00:39.561
and that wasn't at all sexy.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.653
Noted, so you're probably gonna
want one of the classier places.

00:44.740 --> 00:48.004
Not too near the railroad tracks
or a mental institution.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.571
Exactly, maybe one that provides

00:49.658 --> 00:51.138
a limo service
so we can all drink.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.530
No, no, the places
that offer the free shuttles

00:52.617 --> 00:54.402
are usually desperate
for customers

00:54.489 --> 00:56.839
so I'm guessing those girls are
probably all nude and half dude.

01:00.321 --> 01:03.672
We don't want
to spin that wheel.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.891
No, we don't, it's hard to enjoy
bonding with your buddies

01:05.978 --> 01:08.329
when you got some he-she shaking
her furry gonads in your face.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.463
Again, boy scout camp.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.685
Okay, so no he-shes
and we rent our own limo.

01:16.772 --> 01:19.818
But keep in mind, the all nude
joints do not serve alcohol.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.385
We're definitely
gonna want booze.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.300
- It is my bachelor party.
- Absolutely.

01:23.387 --> 01:24.867
'Cause when you're
pleasantly buzzed

01:24.954 --> 01:27.174
the strip club is
like an erotic sexual playpen.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.567
Stone-cold sober
and you're just a dirty freak

01:29.654 --> 01:31.003
paying an unwed mother
to smack you around

01:31.091 --> 01:33.136
with her silicone fun bags.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.618
Well, if the father
of the groom gets a vote

01:36.705 --> 01:39.534
I say all-nude and get drunk
in the parking lot.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.494
Dad?

01:43.581 --> 01:49.021
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

01:49.109 --> 01:52.155
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:02.948 --> 02:05.603
Close that gaping pie hole
and give your old man a hug.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.518
Yes, sir.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.216
You dropped some tonnage boy.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.827
My hands can actually wave
at each other behind your back.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.091
How long you been sitting here?

02:15.178 --> 02:16.614
You walked by me twice.

02:16.701 --> 02:19.617
I guess we know why
you haven't made detective yet.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.532
You're gonna introduce me
to your best man?

02:21.619 --> 02:24.187
Oh, yeah, dad, this is
my partner Carl McMillan.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.841
And you, sir,
need no introduction.

02:25.928 --> 02:28.713
Sergeant Jack Biggs is
legendary around our precinct.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.411
I see the department's
still big on going

02:30.498 --> 02:33.718
salt and pepper
in their squad car.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.416
I rode with a black fella
for years.

02:35.503 --> 02:36.808
Officer Tony Clements.

02:36.895 --> 02:39.115
Great guy,
used to call me fat Casper.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.553
Hell of a cop.

02:42.640 --> 02:46.122
His second wife blew a hole
in him with a 12-gauge.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.037
She was white.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.821
I mean, just saying,
sometimes it works

02:49.908 --> 02:51.258
sometimes it doesn't.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.044
Well, we certainly have
our good days and bad days.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.828
Sit down, dad.

02:56.915 --> 02:59.440
I thought you weren't coming
to town until next week.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.485
Well, that was the plan,
but your stepmom and I

03:01.572 --> 03:03.661
are going through
kind of a rough patch.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.533
Oh, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.709
Eh, marriage has
its ups and downs.

03:07.796 --> 03:10.233
One day, you're madly in love,
the next day, you're fishin'

03:10.320 --> 03:11.887
your clothes out of the birdbath

03:11.974 --> 03:14.194
and sleeping in the backseat
of your Buick Skylark.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.110
Well, I'm sure
things will work out.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.808
Uh, better than it did
for poor Tony.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.549
I'd rather have to fight
some crow for my undies

03:21.636 --> 03:22.898
instead of getting donut-holed

03:22.985 --> 03:24.291
by some crazy bitch
with a shotgun.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.859
Ain't that the truth?

03:27.946 --> 03:30.035
Poor bastard
never saw it coming.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.386
How could he? He was laying
on the neighbor lady.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.346
Hey.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.565
To Tony.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.131
[both]
Tony.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.313
I'm sure happy for you, son,
but I hope

03:46.400 --> 03:49.011
you've sown all your wild oats.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.405
I've done fine
in that area, dad.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.886
I married your mom too young
and I was trapped.

03:54.973 --> 03:58.107
Year after year,
making love to the same woman

03:58.194 --> 03:59.848
in the same position

03:59.935 --> 04:02.503
with the same time limit.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.679
Time limit?

04:04.766 --> 04:07.421
Your mother would say,
when "Mork & Mindy" is finished

04:07.508 --> 04:08.770
so are you.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.991
Well, look, I appreciate
your fatherly advice

04:13.078 --> 04:14.819
but I've lived most
of my life without it

04:14.906 --> 04:15.907
and I'm doing just fine.

04:15.994 --> 04:18.519
Oh, I see, you're a man now.

04:18.606 --> 04:21.304
You got it all
figured out, do you?

04:21.391 --> 04:25.134
I bet I can still pin
your ass in under six seconds.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.136
Dad, no, I'm not
gonna wrestle you.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.877
Nothing to be scared of.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.835
I'm just an old man

04:30.922 --> 04:32.533
talking gibberish.

04:32.620 --> 04:33.838
Stop it.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.840
What's the matter?
You gonna cry?

04:35.927 --> 04:39.366
Did your mama raise you
to be a big sissy girl?

04:39.453 --> 04:41.368
Alright, it's on, old man!

04:45.285 --> 04:46.503
Mike, is that you?

04:46.590 --> 04:49.114
Hi, sweetie, this is my dad.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.423
Hey, sunshine,
nice to meet you.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.077
You, too.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.558
Oh, I can see the resemblance.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.996
[grunts]

05:04.391 --> 05:06.349
So this is Mike's father, huh?

05:06.436 --> 05:09.265
Still got most of his hair.
That's a good sign.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.832
I think baldness
is on the mom's side

05:10.919 --> 05:12.660
and it skips a generation.

05:12.747 --> 05:13.965
Oh, that's right.

05:14.052 --> 05:17.229
I saw pictures
of Vince's maternal grandma.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.754
She looked like Tweetie Pie
with a monobrow.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.975
[snores]

05:24.062 --> 05:25.586
Whoa.

05:25.673 --> 05:29.329
Apparently that doesn't
skip a generation.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.809
And it doesn't get cuter
with age.

05:31.896 --> 05:34.856
All in all though,
a pleasant-looking man.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.859
Yeah, hard to believe
he was married to Mike's mom.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.775
Well, based on his breath,
I'm guessing

05:40.862 --> 05:42.907
the whisky
impaired his judgment.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.129
- Mornin'.
- Shh.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.131
Hey, sweetie, do you
want some breakfast?

05:49.218 --> 05:51.220
I got a pretty bad hangover.
Just coffee for now.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.004
I'll eat after I throw up.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.704
Listen, I'm happy your dad
is staying here

05:56.791 --> 05:58.662
but you need to get him
out of the house tonight.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.664
You want me to take him
to my bachelor party?

06:00.751 --> 06:03.319
Well, I certainly don't want him
here for my bachelorette party

06:03.406 --> 06:04.886
with your mother in attendance.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.409
What, why the hell
is my mom coming?

06:06.496 --> 06:08.411
Because you said and I quote..

06:08.498 --> 06:10.457
[imitating Mike]
"I think it'd be nice
if you asked my mother."

06:13.764 --> 06:16.376
Okay, first of all,
I do not talk like that.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.855
And second of all,
I can't take my dad

06:17.942 --> 06:19.727
to my bachelor party,
he'll ruin everything.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.859
Ruin what? You said
you were just gonna..

06:21.946 --> 06:24.688
[imitating Mike]
"...Grab a steak, smoke a cigar,
drink some scotch."

06:24.775 --> 06:25.863
Blah, blah, blah.

06:28.692 --> 06:31.129
Is that seriously
how you think I sound?

06:33.088 --> 06:34.785
Wait a minute, you don't
want your dad to go along

06:34.872 --> 06:36.744
because Carl is taking you
to the strip club.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.573
What? He'd better not be.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.183
I hate those places.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.315
The guys are all perverts,
the women are all sad.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.579
I can't think of a worse place
to have a bachelor party.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.841
Yuck.

06:51.846 --> 06:54.457
Fine, I'll take my dad!

06:54.544 --> 06:56.546
See, you sound
just like yourself.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.775
Didn't see you
in the cafeteria today.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.560
You missed a good one.
Frito pie and blueberry crumble.

07:10.647 --> 07:13.650
That's why the windows are open.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.652
Hey, grease, cheese and Fritos.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.915
It ain't gonna come out pretty.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.221
Anyway, I brought you
a little something.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.005
What's this for?

07:21.092 --> 07:23.138
Well, I won't be attending
your soireetonight

07:23.225 --> 07:24.618
so I thought
I'd give you my gift here.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.097
And don't get your hopes up.

07:26.184 --> 07:29.144
It's not dirty
and you can't eat it.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.624
Oh, you're not coming?

07:30.711 --> 07:33.801
Aw, gosh, that's just a stinker.

07:33.888 --> 07:36.934
- Darn it.
- Hey, cut the crap.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.675
You and I both know
you only invited me

07:38.762 --> 07:39.937
'cause Mike told you to.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.157
What? It was totally my idea.

07:42.244 --> 07:43.593
I love your company.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.553
You are...a hoot.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.819
Well, I got better things to do
than sitting at a hen party

07:51.906 --> 07:55.431
drinking pink squirrels and
giggling over rubber wienies.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.085
I understand your trepidation.

07:57.172 --> 07:59.391
Plus, you might wanna
steer clear of my house.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.569
Your ex is in town
and he's staying with us.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.528
So Jack's here?

08:05.615 --> 08:08.444
Yeah, and it's probably best
if you guys don't have

08:08.531 --> 08:11.621
your first eye-to-eye
in 20 years in my living room.

08:11.708 --> 08:12.840
It's hard enough
getting my mom's

08:12.927 --> 08:15.886
red wine stains out of the rug.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.801
Hey, I got no beef with the man.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.803
Nothin' to prove
and no ax to grind.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.196
Really?

08:21.283 --> 08:24.373
Oh, I moved on
with my life long ago.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.028
Did he bring the whore?

08:27.115 --> 08:29.857
No, he came by himself.

08:29.944 --> 08:30.901
Between you and me,
I think there's

08:30.988 --> 08:32.468
a little trouble in paradise.

08:32.555 --> 08:33.948
Hmm, what a shame.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.340
Sure do hate to hear that

08:35.427 --> 08:37.386
when bad things happen
to nice people.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.826
What time is your shindig again?

08:42.913 --> 08:46.221
Uh, s-seven-ish. Why?

08:46.308 --> 08:48.136
Well, you're gonna be
my daughter-in-law

08:48.223 --> 08:50.399
and I'd hate to miss
your special night.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.835
You know what?
You're right.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.011
It'll probably get
pretty raunchy

08:54.098 --> 08:56.884
so...don't come.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.670
I'll be by early
to help you set up.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.586
I'll bring some sipping whisky
and an X-rated board game.

09:03.673 --> 09:06.067
- X-rated board game?
- Dirty scrabble.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.677
It's actually just
regular scrabble

09:07.764 --> 09:09.636
with extra F's, B's and J's.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.510
Man, I can't believe
you're bringing your dad

09:14.597 --> 09:15.816
to my bachelor party.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.252
I thought it was
mybachelor party.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.036
Did you plan it?

09:19.123 --> 09:20.385
Are you the one that's
been going to strip clubs

09:20.472 --> 09:23.084
for three months
trying to find the best one?

09:23.171 --> 09:24.868
I'm sorry, Carl,
there's nothing I can do.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.043
I can't leave him
at Molly's house.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.523
My mom's gonna be there.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.133
So why don't you drop
your dad off at a movie?

09:29.220 --> 09:31.222
Or buy him a sweat suit
and let him walk the mall?

09:31.309 --> 09:33.268
Yeah, old people love going all
knees and elbows at the mall.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.228
He's coming and I don't wanna
hear another word about it.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.665
He'll ruin everything.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.841
You ever seen strippers
around a cute, old dude?

09:40.928 --> 09:42.930
It's like bringing
a puppy or a midget.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.584
They get all the attention.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.324
I promise
I'll keep him occupied.

09:46.411 --> 09:49.371
You guys can
still have a good time.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.852
Yeah, a stripper slaps him
in the face with her boob

09:51.939 --> 09:53.897
and his teeth wind up
in my watery Sprite.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.468
Hey, Molly. What?

09:59.555 --> 10:01.078
My mom's on her way
to the house?

10:01.165 --> 10:02.602
Yeah, my dad's there.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.386
He's probably still
asleep on the couch.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.909
Alright, on my way.
Hit the siren.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.476
We gotta get there
before we have to arrest

10:07.563 --> 10:09.652
my mom and tag and bag my dad.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.349
[police siren blaring]

10:17.747 --> 10:19.096
This is gonna be nice.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.490
Just us gals sitting around

10:21.577 --> 10:24.449
sipping some cocktails,
having a little girl talk.

10:24.536 --> 10:25.755
Sure.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.583
But keep in the back
of your mind

10:27.670 --> 10:30.194
it's not too late to go out
and do something fun.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.244
Yeah, I was hoping for a big
hunk of penis-shaped cake

10:36.331 --> 10:39.334
or seeing a big hunk's penis.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.944
Mom.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.251
Ooh, there's a place
you can go downtown

10:43.338 --> 10:45.819
where you can lick whipped
cream off a guy's bare chest.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.909
Ooh, won't be able to do that
after you're married.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.606
[doorbell rings]
Have you met my fiance?

10:50.693 --> 10:53.174
His chest hair's
like an Easter basket.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.610
That's not hyperbole.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.656
One time, I actually
found a jelly bean.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.660
Two of them have
to make everything dirty.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.097
It's like my confirmation party
all over again.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.018
Whoa. Peggy.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.934
Hope I'm not too early.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.632
- Boys still here?
- No, they left.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.113
Damn it!

11:19.200 --> 11:21.202
- Are you okay?
- 'Couldn't be better.'

11:21.289 --> 11:22.507
Here you go.

11:22.594 --> 11:25.554
Another gift
for the bride-to-be.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.469
Please tell me
that's French bread.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.256
Okay, but that French bread's
black and it vibrates.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.695
[vibrates]

11:41.831 --> 11:43.398
Thanks for letting me
join you boys.

11:43.485 --> 11:44.747
I'm sure none
of you fellas wanted

11:44.834 --> 11:46.531
the groom's old man
tagging along.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.667
Happy to have you, dad.
Right, guys?

11:51.754 --> 11:54.322
[all mumbling]
Yeah.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.237
Sorry we had to rush you
out of the house so early.

11:56.324 --> 11:57.934
Mom was coming over
and I didn't want a repeat

11:58.021 --> 11:59.327
of our last little
get-together.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.546
Yeah, I still got the scar
where she clocked me

12:01.633 --> 12:04.419
behind the ear
with that disposable camera.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.682
It did liven up my high
school graduation though.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.380
And believe it or not, the
pictures still came out great.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.208
So what's the deal?

12:11.295 --> 12:13.080
Are we going to a strip club
or are you guys gonna be

12:13.167 --> 12:15.125
the biggest boobs
I see all night?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.173
We can't go to
a nudie bar this early.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.783
The sun's still out.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.960
And our coupons don't
kick in till 7:00 p.m.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.093
Plus, the day shift
is still on the pole

12:26.180 --> 12:28.617
and they're tired, cranky
and sometimes pregnant.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.100
Not to mention the sad,
desperate clientele

12:33.187 --> 12:35.580
that hangs out there
during the day.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.800
Lonely losers blowing
their rent money

12:37.887 --> 12:40.542
trying to get one of the girls
to love 'em back.

12:40.629 --> 12:43.153
And they never do.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.547
I got a lot of respect
for you, kid.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.592
If I were dealt your hand,
I'd have jumped in the lake

12:47.679 --> 12:50.595
with a pocket full
of rocks years ago.

12:50.682 --> 12:53.076
My mom sews my pockets shut.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.778
Look, we got this limo
for the whole night.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.518
It's climate-controlled.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.172
Got a fully-stocked bar
and we can go anywhere we want

13:02.259 --> 13:03.826
in one of the greatest
cities in the world.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.349
You guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:05.436 --> 13:06.655
White Castle drive-through?

13:06.742 --> 13:09.092
- Fine with me!
- Yes!

13:09.179 --> 13:11.138
God, you can read me
like a book.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.618
Well, it's easy when every
chapter is titled I Could Eat.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.015
It's just a little something
I thought might come

13:19.102 --> 13:20.234
in handy on the honeymoon.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.583
Ooh!

13:21.670 --> 13:23.672
- Sexy panties?
- No.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.109
- Flavored love jellies?
- No.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.459
Ball gag and nipple clamps?

13:34.422 --> 13:36.380
God, no!
It's just a clip-on book light.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.643
I thought
we weren't going dirty.

13:38.730 --> 13:39.993
[doorbell rings]

13:40.080 --> 13:43.823
Oh, my goodness.
I wonder who that is.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.955
I hope someone
didn't call the police

13:46.042 --> 13:48.915
because we were being
too loud and naughty.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.702
Please tell me that
she didn't get a stripper.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.835
Please tell me
she didn't say ball gag.

13:58.272 --> 14:01.536
Oh, no, officer.
Are we in trouble?

14:01.623 --> 14:04.452
- Big trouble.
- There's the ringleader.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.933
And she's been a bad, bad girl.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.545
I've been worse.

14:12.503 --> 14:16.116
I'm hiding drugs
and I ain't got pockets.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.945
[upbeat music]

14:19.032 --> 14:20.424
Well, you'll all pay the price

14:20.511 --> 14:22.470
but the bride-to-be
gets the first crack.

14:22.557 --> 14:23.993
Enjoy, ladies.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.691
Touch, cup or tug,
he's paid for till 10:00.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.696
That is...very nice

14:31.783 --> 14:33.873
but I really would just like

14:33.960 --> 14:35.875
to know your secret
for hair removal.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.880
Alright, we still got
another hour to kill

14:40.967 --> 14:41.924
before we can head over
to the strip club.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.708
Only an hour?

14:43.795 --> 14:47.538
But I was so enjoying this
man-thigh on man-thigh action.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.280
Well, if we're looking
for something to do

14:50.367 --> 14:52.717
we could swing by my mom's
and I could prove to her

14:52.804 --> 14:54.763
I do, too, have friends.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.678
Seriously, I would have
plugged in the toaster

14:56.765 --> 14:58.898
and jumped right in the tub.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.247
God love you.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.033
Well, since we got the time,
why don't we go ahead

15:04.120 --> 15:05.730
and do our
little Mike Biggs tribute?

15:05.817 --> 15:07.341
No, come on.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.038
Why don't we moon that kid
at the gas station again?

15:09.125 --> 15:11.040
He'd never expect it
a second time.

15:11.127 --> 15:14.217
No, this evening is about
celebrating you, Mike Biggs.

15:14.304 --> 15:17.786
The man, the myth, the Mountain.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.396
Come on, son,
let your friends honor you.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.224
You think this is
gonna be an honor?

15:21.311 --> 15:23.009
It's gonna be a bunch
of smart-ass comments

15:23.096 --> 15:25.794
humiliating stories
and half a dozen fat jokes.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.361
Hey, these are your pals.

15:27.448 --> 15:28.840
I'm sure these guys
have plenty more

15:28.928 --> 15:30.538
to talk about
besides your waistline.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.974
I'm out.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.933
I grabbed the fat ball
and ran with it.

15:36.283 --> 15:38.807
I said nothing about fat,
but I did lean pretty hard

15:38.894 --> 15:40.678
on your homoerotic relationship
with Carl.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.508
With friends like these,
huh, dad?

15:44.595 --> 15:45.857
Yeah.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.294
- I'll go.
- 'Alright, Harry.'

15:47.381 --> 15:48.860
Let me have it.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.386
"How do you say I love you

15:52.473 --> 15:54.997
to your hero?"

15:55.084 --> 15:56.433
I don't think you do.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.046
I don't mean to belabor it

16:00.133 --> 16:02.048
but how do you even get out
of bed in the morning?

16:07.488 --> 16:09.446
Okay, fun's over.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.709
Take these cuffs off.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.190
Okay, pal, that is getting

16:14.277 --> 16:17.237
very close to my face.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.239
That's what they're talking
about when they say

16:19.326 --> 16:20.805
the long arm of the law.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.636
- It's not funny.
- No, that was pretty funny.

16:25.723 --> 16:29.075
When she said arm,
she meant penis.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.772
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no. Stop.

16:30.859 --> 16:31.860
No, stop it!

16:31.947 --> 16:34.036
Oh, my God.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.038
Is that thing winkin' at me?

16:38.519 --> 16:40.390
[dog barking]

16:43.524 --> 16:45.482
"And even though
we kid around a lot

16:45.569 --> 16:47.267
"when you get down to it,
I could not have asked

16:47.354 --> 16:49.660
"for a better partner
or a better friend.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.707
"I know you always have my back
and I always have yours.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.578
"And I'm so happy
you found Molly

16:54.665 --> 16:57.799
because you deserve a partner
as good as the one I got."

16:57.886 --> 16:59.888
Thanks, pal.

16:59.975 --> 17:02.412
To the man of the hour,
Mr. Mike Biggs.

17:02.499 --> 17:03.544
- Hear, hear.
- Salud.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.459
Love you, man.

17:05.546 --> 17:06.808
Lovely toast.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.244
Really beautiful.

17:08.331 --> 17:09.680
How come his is beautiful

17:09.767 --> 17:12.161
and I'm a big, sappy fruit?

17:12.248 --> 17:15.121
I don't know, they were
saying now it's genetics.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.257
All nude, girls, girls, girls.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.954
Boy, that sounds
way better than all men

17:23.042 --> 17:25.174
and farts, farts, farts.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.350
Remember not to lay out
all your cash at the rail.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.961
Buck at a time
like you're feeding baby ducks.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.833
I've given myself a $200 limit

17:31.920 --> 17:34.401
so if you see me reach
for my ATM card

17:34.488 --> 17:36.316
throw a cold beer in my lap.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.497
I'll see you gentlemen inside.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.717
Only thing better than
an old guy or a midget?

17:46.804 --> 17:49.242
Blind guy.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.331
Hey, wait up!
Somebody's got to lead me in.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.639
You ready, dad?

17:55.726 --> 17:58.207
- I'll meet you inside.
- What's the matter?

17:59.817 --> 18:01.341
I'm just..

18:01.428 --> 18:04.561
...so proud of how
you've turned out.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.389
You got people who love
and respect you.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.783
And I-I know
it's not because of me.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.219
It's in spite of me.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.352
- Oh, don't say that.
- It's true.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.616
I ran off and left you.

18:15.703 --> 18:19.010
And at a time
when a boy really needs his dad.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.621
That's in the past.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.579
You're here now.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.973
That's all that matters.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.410
Appreciate you
letting me off the hook.

18:27.497 --> 18:30.500
I promise
I'll make it up to you.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.502
Try to be more of a dad
than I have been.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.897
I'd like that.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.247
Hey, what do you say
we get the limo driver

18:38.334 --> 18:41.076
to cruise us around
the old neighborhood?

18:41.163 --> 18:44.297
It's your night.
Do whatever you want.

18:44.384 --> 18:45.820
But I'm headin' in.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.566
Ah, it'd be a shame to waste
this precious father-son time.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.052
I hope you and the wife
work things out.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.924
Well, if we don't,
I think I got a real shot

19:03.011 --> 19:05.144
with that Cuban stripper.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.449
- I think she really liked you.
- Yeah.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.234
I mean, until you
ran out of money.

19:08.321 --> 19:09.931
Yeah, strip clubs
aren't a good place

19:10.018 --> 19:12.542
for a man on a fixed income.

19:12.629 --> 19:14.762
By the way,
my last three lap dances

19:14.849 --> 19:17.068
were your wedding present.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.462
Well, it's important for you
to enjoy what little time

19:19.549 --> 19:21.377
you got left, old man.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.727
Oh, game on, boy.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.257
Hello, Jack.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.782
Long time, no see.

19:34.869 --> 19:38.089
This is Lieutenant Sexy
and he's giving me a ride home.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.179
Then he's gonna
drop me off at the house.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.310
Get it?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.793
Who the hell was that?

19:45.880 --> 19:47.534
I have no idea.

19:52.147 --> 19:53.453
Him, I know.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.157
[theme music]
