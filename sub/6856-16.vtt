- <i>How are you doing over there?</i>
- We're set.

00:45.653 --> 00:48.005
I've got some guys here
that are anxious to get going.

00:58.011 --> 00:59.511
We're back, general.

00:59.991 --> 01:02.141
Good. The show is about to begin.

01:04.489 --> 01:06.539
How's that cannon coming, boys?

01:06.664 --> 01:09.360
We'll have this one back in business
in no time, sir.

01:13.446 --> 01:14.782
The droids are advancing.

01:18.415 --> 01:21.615
I'm seeing a full battalion
coming right on schedule.

01:23.155 --> 01:24.792
Tanks! They brought tanks.

01:34.415 --> 01:35.715
A little closer.

01:39.698 --> 01:41.142
They're splitting up.

01:41.648 --> 01:42.398
What?

01:44.810 --> 01:46.939
Something's gone wrong.
Prepare all troops for...

01:58.702 --> 02:00.102
Abort the mission!

02:04.762 --> 02:06.862
Our position's been compromised.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.048
Obi-Wan, what's going on?

02:13.962 --> 02:16.412
We're cut off.
The droids are onto us.

02:22.822 --> 02:25.978
Gunship, come in. Hawk,
we need an e-vac in the south tower.

02:26.429 --> 02:28.429
Roger that, sir. We're coming.

02:31.645 --> 02:34.695
- South tower? We're in the north.
- Not for long.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.574
Rex, fire your cables.

02:46.540 --> 02:47.590
Blast them!

03:03.016 --> 03:05.643
- This way is clear.
- How did you get over here?

03:05.896 --> 03:07.046
I improvised.

03:25.993 --> 03:26.914
Now what?

04:07.346 --> 04:10.441
Maybe this tactical droid will tell us
how they knew our plan.

04:18.322 --> 04:21.423
<i>The Republic army
is in the north and south towers:</i>

04:21.921 --> 04:22.933
<i>level 46.</i>

04:23.807 --> 04:25.267
It just doesn't make sense.

04:29.149 --> 04:29.949
Blast!

04:31.516 --> 04:34.148
Well, at least we're not the only ones
having a bad day.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.266
Generals,

04:37.443 --> 04:38.986
they had all our intel.

04:39.416 --> 04:41.044
That would explain the ambush.

04:41.169 --> 04:44.241
How could we have left ourselves
so vulnerable to a security breach?

04:45.348 --> 04:47.923
- I don't think we did.
- You think someone

04:48.048 --> 04:50.548
- infiltrated our defenses?
- Possibly.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.560
It'd have to be someone
cunning and resourceful enough

04:53.685 --> 04:55.547
to gain access to all our plans.

04:55.672 --> 04:58.172
But that's still wouldn't explain
how they got our intel.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.224
No. You're right.

05:00.989 --> 05:03.969
They wouldn't act alone. They'd have
someone working with them.

05:04.298 --> 05:05.348
A spy, sir?

05:06.046 --> 05:09.224
But who would want
to betray our troops to the Seppies?

05:09.479 --> 05:11.112
Excellent question, Commander.

05:11.237 --> 05:13.861
Perhaps it's time we made a visit
behind enemy lines.

05:13.986 --> 05:16.815
- I think we'll find our answers there.
- We'll get right on it.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.902
No, Captain. I need you here
to find the security breach.

05:20.295 --> 05:23.095
- You can count on us, sir.
- One more thing:

05:23.243 --> 05:25.612
this mission
is extremely confidential.

05:25.737 --> 05:27.423
The spy could be anyone.

05:27.548 --> 05:29.495
Let no one know of our mission.

05:30.474 --> 05:31.774
Understood, sir.

05:39.230 --> 05:40.923
Someone left this comlink on.

05:41.446 --> 05:42.508
Someone

05:42.717 --> 05:45.127
has been listening
to everything we said.

05:46.749 --> 05:47.680
Hey! Stop!

05:50.102 --> 05:51.152
Who's that?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.547
I'll follow him.
You take the west corridor.

05:57.672 --> 05:58.672
I'm on it.

06:13.076 --> 06:14.999
He must have gone in the mess hall.

06:19.769 --> 06:21.469
We've got a big problem.

06:22.166 --> 06:22.916
Yeah.

06:23.495 --> 06:25.992
The only people in here
are brothers.

06:30.687 --> 06:31.687
One of us?

06:32.351 --> 06:33.898
Great, but which one?

06:35.145 --> 06:38.522
We'll have to wait for his next move.
Keep this to ourselves.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.300
Better contact the Jedi.

06:40.425 --> 06:41.425
I'm on it.

06:57.063 --> 07:00.163
Don't shoot. Just keep
their communications jammed.

07:00.444 --> 07:01.594
Roger, roger.

07:02.206 --> 07:04.206
We can't reach General Kenobi.

07:04.331 --> 07:07.178
Whoever it is has blocked
our communications.

07:07.303 --> 07:10.003
We're gonna have
to find this guy ourselves.

07:10.570 --> 07:12.620
R2, come over here and plug in.

07:16.641 --> 07:17.804
What are you doing?

07:17.929 --> 07:20.489
The guard got his messages
out there somehow.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.864
- We just got to find them.
- What do you think?

07:22.989 --> 07:26.227
- He just sat down and wrote a note?
- You have to start somewhere.

07:30.543 --> 07:32.804
We appear to have picked up
some friends.

07:32.929 --> 07:33.867
Indeed.

07:33.992 --> 07:37.664
In fact, I believe the number of eyes
watching us has been steadily growing.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.627
Great. Perhaps this means our adversary
has learned about our mission.

07:41.877 --> 07:42.920
Perhaps it does.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.506
Of course,
nobody's tried to stop us yet.

07:45.814 --> 07:46.992
Also true.

07:47.117 --> 07:49.428
They want us to get to
the Separatist headquarters,

07:49.553 --> 07:51.242
which means this is a trap.

07:51.367 --> 07:52.554
I imagine it is.

07:52.866 --> 07:55.140
Well, that's unfortunate...
For them.

07:59.082 --> 08:00.632
R2's found something.

08:01.571 --> 08:03.315
What is it? Is it the traitor?

08:04.220 --> 08:05.370
I'm not sure.

08:06.583 --> 08:09.029
- Maybe.
- What is he looking for?

08:09.334 --> 08:13.033
Wavelength interference,
weak frequencies, spotty, irregular.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.467
See, how it shows up every few days

08:15.592 --> 08:18.330
then disappears?
Day to day, you wouldn't notice it.

08:20.005 --> 08:21.905
- What?
- It's the pattern.

08:22.374 --> 08:25.824
The band's only coming off
one terminal in the whole base.

08:26.241 --> 08:27.391
Check it out.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.633
Slick's barracks.

08:29.969 --> 08:32.344
Only Sslick's men
would have access to that terminal.

08:33.809 --> 08:35.681
Slick's not gonna like that.

08:35.998 --> 08:37.148
No, he's not.

08:37.273 --> 08:40.173
But if one of his men
is giving away our intel,

08:40.366 --> 08:42.395
we have to find him
and sort this out.

08:52.723 --> 08:54.648
No guards, no barricades,

08:55.697 --> 08:58.704
you'd think the Separatist headquarters
would be better protected.

09:01.805 --> 09:05.207
But clearly, keeping us out
is not what they intend.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.853
No way. My guys are the best.

09:13.479 --> 09:15.721
No way they're capable
of something like this.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.389
Something like what?

09:20.828 --> 09:23.247
- You called them here?
- Of course we did.

09:23.372 --> 09:25.898
We're getting to the bottom of this...
Now.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.140
Look, let me have a few minutes
with them first.

09:29.798 --> 09:31.243
It's gonna hit them hard.

09:31.368 --> 09:34.618
They trust each other,
and if one of our own betrayed us...

09:34.743 --> 09:38.193
I don't think that's necessary.
Your men are tough, right?

09:38.746 --> 09:40.396
Take a seat, gentlemen.

09:43.731 --> 09:45.613
We have a turncoat in our midst,

09:46.668 --> 09:48.618
and we think it's one of you.

09:59.025 --> 10:01.225
So this is the belly of the beast.

10:09.060 --> 10:10.010
Ventress.

10:10.581 --> 10:13.111
And here I thought this mission
would be unpleasant.

10:13.473 --> 10:16.524
The pleasure's all mine,
my dear Obi-Wan.

10:17.525 --> 10:18.825
I've missed you.

10:26.310 --> 10:29.878
I don't know, I was doing the things
I always do after a mission.

10:30.434 --> 10:32.834
- Things like what?
- I'm sorry, sir.

10:33.117 --> 10:35.968
I'm just a little nervous.
You're my C.O.

10:36.530 --> 10:38.030
The way I figure it,

10:38.155 --> 10:41.372
you tell the truth,
you got nothing to be nervous about.

10:41.497 --> 10:44.698
Jester is telling the truth. He cleans
his weapon after every mission.

10:44.823 --> 10:47.932
First thing, every time.
He's kind of obsessed that way.

10:48.057 --> 10:49.079
Is that right?

10:49.204 --> 10:51.191
- You were cleaning your weapon?
- Yes, sir.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.129
Go on the computer
while you were in here?

10:53.313 --> 10:56.363
No, sir. I didn't even power it up.
You can check.

10:58.571 --> 11:00.071
Show me your weapon.

11:02.225 --> 11:03.825
Yep, freshly scrubbed.

11:04.401 --> 11:07.302
- The rag's over there in the corner.
- Good man.

11:07.427 --> 11:08.233
You.

11:08.485 --> 11:11.835
- You were cleaning your weapon too?
- No, I was hungry.

11:12.075 --> 11:13.775
I went back to the mess.

11:14.288 --> 11:15.924
- Right away?
- Yeah.

11:17.346 --> 11:18.427
Anyone with you?

11:19.594 --> 11:20.694
Sketch, sir.

11:20.819 --> 11:24.182
We got to the mess at the same time,
got our grub, and sat together.

11:24.471 --> 11:27.811
Anyone else in the mess able to confirm
what you two are saying?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.058
Lots of guys there.
Ask any of them.

11:30.684 --> 11:33.483
- We will.
- Captain, give me a moment with them.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.810
No, it's okay, Sarge.
I got nothing to hide.

11:35.935 --> 11:37.237
I was in the infirmary.

11:37.825 --> 11:40.308
Got banged up pretty good
by one of those clankers.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.189
A med droid was fixing me up.

11:42.314 --> 11:45.514
Doc's got all the records there
if you want to check.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.368
So, Chopper, old boy,

11:50.934 --> 11:53.211
- what's your alibi?
- I was in the mess hall.

11:53.517 --> 11:54.713
No, you weren't!

11:55.130 --> 11:56.438
I mean, you...

11:56.925 --> 11:59.551
If you know something, kid,
you should speak up.

12:00.523 --> 12:02.888
Chopper came in a lot later.

12:03.399 --> 12:04.900
After everyone else.

12:15.796 --> 12:19.198
My loyal informant let me know
you were coming.

12:19.801 --> 12:22.449
Well, then, we thank you
for your hospitality.

12:36.414 --> 12:38.688
Where were you
before you went to the mess, Chopper?

12:38.813 --> 12:40.801
Nowhere. Walking around.

12:41.089 --> 12:43.887
Son, you know we'll need
a better answer than that.

12:45.707 --> 12:46.807
I was hiding

12:47.576 --> 12:48.976
at the south exit.

12:49.767 --> 12:52.104
I didn't want anyone to see me
string these together.

12:54.009 --> 12:55.774
Battle droid fingers.

12:57.368 --> 12:58.318
I just...

12:58.757 --> 13:00.689
I just wanted something back.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.989
I guess I felt like they owed me.

13:03.732 --> 13:06.326
I always knew there was something
deficient about you.

13:09.512 --> 13:12.656
This isn't good, Chopper.
Lying about where you were,

13:12.781 --> 13:15.431
taking forbidden items
from a battlefield.

13:16.132 --> 13:16.982
I know.

13:17.170 --> 13:20.170
I put up with the attitude
'cause you have skill.

13:20.392 --> 13:23.802
But if you could break these rules,
your whole character's in question here.

13:24.175 --> 13:25.575
Wait, no! Hang on.

13:26.076 --> 13:27.126
I'm no spy!

13:37.387 --> 13:39.064
Chopper, we're all brothers.

13:39.189 --> 13:41.839
But how can we trust anything
you say now?

13:42.382 --> 13:45.582
- No, sir, I'm telling you, I did not...
- It's okay.

13:45.869 --> 13:47.941
We'll get you
a proper investigation.

13:48.066 --> 13:51.558
You don't have to say anything
till the Jedi come back and talk to you.

13:51.683 --> 13:54.040
Maybe you should talk, sir.
Tell them where you went.

13:54.327 --> 13:56.441
I was at the south exit, remember?

13:56.566 --> 13:58.690
I saw you go in go in, sir.
I saw you.

13:58.815 --> 14:00.628
Chopper, I have been patient.

14:00.753 --> 14:03.442
Everyone else turned right
toward the barracks and the mess.

14:03.567 --> 14:06.217
You turned left,
toward the command center.

14:07.138 --> 14:11.141
- Where were you going, sir?
- Obviously, the kid feels cornered.

14:11.691 --> 14:14.993
Sergeant, what did you mean,
"Till the Jedi come back"?

14:15.686 --> 14:17.814
How did you know the Jedi were gone?

14:19.615 --> 14:22.462
I really wish
you hadn't noticed that, sir.

14:24.996 --> 14:25.864
It's Slick?

14:28.261 --> 14:29.761
Slick's the traitor?

14:51.946 --> 14:55.042
- I've got someone by the gunships.
- That's our Slick.

14:55.167 --> 14:57.771
Now that he's exposed,
he has to get out of this base.

14:58.993 --> 15:01.743
There's no escape now,
you piece of rankweed!

15:06.750 --> 15:07.800
Move. Move!

15:20.568 --> 15:22.568
He took out our weapons depot.

15:24.655 --> 15:26.355
He knew where we'd look.

15:26.706 --> 15:28.382
He's not trying to escape.

15:28.507 --> 15:31.457
He knows all our moves
before we even make them.

15:35.697 --> 15:36.893
Give up, Ventress!

15:37.469 --> 15:38.882
I am all yours,

15:39.007 --> 15:40.063
Obi-Wan.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.449
You've served your purpose.

15:51.744 --> 15:54.953
- We have to get back. Now!
- It's already too late.

15:55.243 --> 15:58.790
So hard to know
whom to trust these days, isn't it?

15:59.152 --> 16:00.852
What's the plan, Master?

16:00.977 --> 16:03.577
Bringing us here was a mistake,
my sweet.

16:04.290 --> 16:06.590
You've overestimated your abilities.

16:07.130 --> 16:07.980
Really?

16:20.300 --> 16:21.900
Come and get me, boys!

16:24.873 --> 16:27.402
You didn't tell us
you were bringing friends.

16:27.944 --> 16:29.262
Poor Obi-Wan.

16:29.825 --> 16:31.375
You've been betrayed.

16:31.632 --> 16:34.451
And now we're about
to take control of this world.

16:38.429 --> 16:40.579
- How do we get this guy?
- Sir.

16:40.984 --> 16:42.667
Slick ran into the command center.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.543
You guys stay here.
Seal the perimeter.

17:14.412 --> 17:16.367
Prepare to march on the city.

17:23.066 --> 17:26.516
Have General Loathesome
delay the Jedi as long as possible.

17:26.727 --> 17:30.377
I will need time to execute
the next part of my Master's plan.

17:30.695 --> 17:31.895
Yes, Mistress.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.343
Pretend you're Slick.
What's in your head?

17:51.676 --> 17:53.659
My cover's blown, it's time to go,

17:53.784 --> 17:57.134
but I decide not to use a ship
because it's too obvious.

18:03.495 --> 18:04.645
The lockdown.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.918
He wants to get around the lockdown.

18:07.166 --> 18:09.375
He's blinded us
by taking out the power.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.715
He could disable
the entire security system.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.552
But he knows we'd expect him
to do that.

18:18.966 --> 18:20.016
Or does he?

18:20.551 --> 18:23.852
- Yeah, I see what you're getting at.
- Go to the south exit.

18:24.181 --> 18:28.012
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll stay here, get the power back up.

18:28.137 --> 18:29.937
- That'll help.
- Got it.

18:36.815 --> 18:38.289
Hey, there, Slick.

18:39.387 --> 18:40.452
Gun's empty.

18:43.349 --> 18:45.399
You know what's funny, traitor?

18:45.980 --> 18:49.836
We knew you'd never take a chance
on the exits while they were blocked.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.050
I'd stay here
to open them myself first.

18:53.638 --> 18:54.838
Just like you.

18:55.204 --> 18:58.762
Don't do a job till you've guaranteed
the best odds, right?

18:59.305 --> 19:00.805
You knew I was here.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.540
Of course we knew.

19:03.081 --> 19:04.809
You think we wouldn't have a plan?

19:05.137 --> 19:06.637
I'm not the traitor.

19:07.323 --> 19:08.223
You are!

19:22.495 --> 19:25.649
All of you just blindly
following orders, for what?

19:30.133 --> 19:33.228
At least I got something
out of all this suffering.

19:35.167 --> 19:38.551
I bet you sold out your brothers
for some real shiny coin.

19:45.823 --> 19:47.623
Yes, she offered me money.

19:48.092 --> 19:50.138
But she offered me
something more important.

19:50.263 --> 19:52.963
Something you wouldn't understand.
Freedom!

19:58.304 --> 20:00.954
I think freedom's
gonna have to wait, kid.

20:03.749 --> 20:04.549
Slick?

20:05.016 --> 20:07.705
- It was you?
- He gave us a bit of a chase, sir.

20:07.941 --> 20:10.176
You couldn't be
a greater disappointment.

20:10.301 --> 20:12.210
How could you do this
to your brothers?

20:13.477 --> 20:15.327
Only a Jedi would ask that.

20:16.319 --> 20:19.069
It's the Jedi
who keep my brothers enslaved.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.918
We do your bidding.

20:21.075 --> 20:22.675
We serve at your whim.

20:23.232 --> 20:25.139
I just wanted something more.

20:25.264 --> 20:29.114
And all you had to do to get it
was put the rest of us all at risk.

20:31.150 --> 20:32.600
I love my brothers.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.594
You're too blind to see it,

20:34.719 --> 20:36.860
but I was striking the blow
for all clones.

20:37.286 --> 20:40.936
If you loved your brothers,
you wouldn't have put them at risk.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.308
You betrayed everyone of us.

20:44.495 --> 20:45.945
Take him to lockup.

20:50.005 --> 20:52.709
Were you able to salvage anything
from the weapons depot?

20:53.236 --> 20:55.837
Slick pretty much scorched
the whole thing.

20:55.962 --> 20:58.203
That seemed to be
what he was going for all along.

20:58.328 --> 21:00.453
We managed to save
the heavy cannons, though.

21:00.578 --> 21:01.578
That's good,

21:01.703 --> 21:04.637
'cause there are about
1,000 battle droids on their way here.

21:04.928 --> 21:06.878
The fight goes on, gentlemen.

21:07.305 --> 21:13.797
