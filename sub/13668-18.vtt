WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:03.320
Previously on St. Elsewhere.

00:03.320 --> 00:05.960
Does he really think
I raped those women? Do you?

00:05.960 --> 00:07.520
Peter, I don't know who to believe.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.240
So we're still on for this evening?

00:09.240 --> 00:10.560
Yeah.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.560
I'm coming up on a birthday
and I don't want to face it.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.160
And I don't want to face it
with only one breast.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.400
And when can I go back to work?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.000
We'll see.  Yeah, but, I promised...

00:20.000 --> 00:21.760
For once, give yourself some time.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.040
This is Paul Revere.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.680
And that is my ailing steed.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.240
Tonight, on St. Elsewhere.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.680
What are you going to do?
Scrape the lump off and sew me up?

00:28.680 --> 00:29.880
It's not that simple. &gt;

00:29.880 --> 00:31.680
Your testicle has to be removed.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.800
And what do I tell the next girl
I go to bed with?

00:33.800 --> 00:34.720
She won't know.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.000
She won't know.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.800
We need to see if anything's broken,
it won't hurt.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.880
Then, can I wear your hat?

00:39.880 --> 00:42.840
Then, can I wear your hat?

00:42.840 --> 00:44.280
&lt; I'll make you a deal,

00:44.280 --> 00:46.160
we'll do it together.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.960
I hardly know you.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.840
We've been ordered to let White
re-join the residency programme.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.360
Peter White is yet to be convicted
of a crime.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.360
You step out of line once,
I'm going to break you in two.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.120
&lt; Argh.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.480
Quite whining, at least they didn't
tear up your knee.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.320
Here we go,
back to sophomore year, right?

02:47.320 --> 02:49.960
Hey, if it weren't for my knee,
I'd have been all Ivy.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.680
Instead, you're all washed up.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.120
When they dragged me off the field
and brought me in here.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.760
Yeah.  The nurses were weird.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.320
They just stood
at the end of the bed.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.040
Not cos they didn't want
to get near you,

02:59.040 --> 03:00.920
they wanted to look up
your hospital gown.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.800
Ha-ha. Guys, don't make me laugh,
it hurts.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.840
Ah, yes, table for three
with a view, please.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.200
What's the problem?

03:06.200 --> 03:08.960
Our friend Kevin Hooper, here,
has been the victim

03:08.960 --> 03:12.960
of a most unfortunate personal foul
in the well-spring of his progeny.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.160
The groin?

03:14.160 --> 03:17.400
We've got to get him in shape
for spring break, we're heading
for Hilton Head.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.160
I thought all you college kids
went down to Fort Lauderdale.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.600
Not Harvard.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.440
Well, boom, boom.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.880
Well, boom, boom.

03:23.880 --> 03:24.920
Yo.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.280
Oh, Kevin, old sport,
if you're not feeling up to it,

03:28.280 --> 03:30.000
perhaps I should go in your place.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.040
This way, please.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.560
This way, please.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.760
You sure, big fella?

03:33.760 --> 03:35.600
Positive.
I'll see you at the apartment.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.280
He's in good hands. Let's go.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.800
I'm Doctor Cavanero.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.320
Cavanero, that's Italian.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.680
Yes, I know.
Do you want to tell me what happened?

03:44.680 --> 03:48.080
My friend Ryan forgot the meaning
of the words touch football.

03:48.080 --> 03:52.000
Hmm. I'll need you to stand.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.560
You've got to take down your pants,
so I can have a look.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.960
&lt; This is a little embarrassing.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.320
I'm a doctor.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.880
I guess, if you've seen one.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.680
Turn your head and bear down.

04:01.680 --> 04:02.360
Do you mean cough?

04:02.360 --> 04:06.360
Do you mean cough?

04:06.600 --> 04:10.600
Hm.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.520
Well?

04:14.520 --> 04:16.600
The left side is a little swollen.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.800
But I'll live?

04:17.800 --> 04:18.760
Kevin, I'm going to admit you.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.079
Kevin, I'm going to admit you.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.279
I'd like to run some tests

04:21.279 --> 04:23.880
and have a urologist
take a look at your other testicle.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.160
There seems to be an irregularity
on the right side.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.400
I've never noticed it.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.400
It could be nothing, but, as long as
you're here, let's get it checked.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.880
Feels like someone took
all the lubricants out of my body. &gt;

04:37.880 --> 04:41.560
I have aches and pains in places
I didn't even know I had.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.040
We'll get you loosened up
in the whirlpool later.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.680
I'd like that, believe me.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.720
&lt; Hi, Amanda.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.760
Hi, Phil.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.320
Mr Barnes, how you coming along?

04:50.320 --> 04:52.640
Arthritis is still
a barrel of laughs.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.840
Did you get the tickets?

04:54.840 --> 04:56.000
No.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.640
Why not?

04:57.640 --> 04:59.160
Ah, we'll talk about it later.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.960
What's the big mystery?

05:00.960 --> 05:02.840
&lt; There's no mystery.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.560
You two going on a date?

05:04.560 --> 05:07.680
We're supposed to be going to see
the Alvin Ailey Dance Company,

05:07.680 --> 05:10.160
but something has obviously
changed our plans.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.720
Mr Barnes, you should be ready
to go home in a couple of days.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.040
Mr Barnes, you should be ready
to go home in a couple of days.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.080
I'll check on you again tomorrow.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.840
Amanda, could I see you outside?

05:17.840 --> 05:20.120
I want to talk to you
about treatment for Mrs Mac.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.520
Sure.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.520
See you at the whirlpool, Mr Barnes.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.240
Amanda, I don't think it's wise
for us to discuss our personal life

05:31.240 --> 05:32.320
in front of patients.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.000
Why not?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.600
Why not?

05:35.600 --> 05:38.680
I see, doctors aren't supposed
to be human beings.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.320
I see, doctors aren't supposed
to be human beings.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.560
Yeah. I was going
to kiss you goodbye, but...

05:43.560 --> 05:44.680
Oh-oh-oh.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.080
Oh-oh-oh.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.200
OK.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.200
Bye-bye.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.920
What are you doing here?

06:00.920 --> 06:02.000
I work here, remember.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.200
I work here, remember.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.000
"To get to know my new breast,"
as you put it.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.200
Yeah, well, you said
you couldn't wait till I got back.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.200
When Doctor Caldwell sees you,
he's going to hit the ceiling.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.000
Why do there always seem to be
tornados in Mississippi?

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, actually, it's a phenomenon
associated with the vernal equinox,

06:22.400 --> 06:24.200
a time of natural upheaval.

06:24.200 --> 06:28.200
I believe that the Gulf of Mexico
provides a moist body of air
in the spring

06:29.040 --> 06:33.040
which, when pushed out by
a cold front, makes violent updrafts.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.920
That's the most I've ever heard
him say in one sitting.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.840
So, Wendy, you didn't have time
for breakfast this morning? &gt;

06:44.840 --> 06:48.720
So, Wendy, you didn't have time
for breakfast this morning? &gt;

06:48.720 --> 06:52.720
Well, are you going to tell us why
or do we have to guess?

06:53.680 --> 06:56.960
I just testified at Peter White's
pre-trial rape hearing.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.880
His lawyer is a real shyster.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.880
Tried to make what happened
in the locker room &gt;

07:00.880 --> 07:03.080
seem like an overblown incident
of hostility. &gt;

07:03.080 --> 07:06.120
This guy tries to rape me
and the court reduces the charge

07:06.120 --> 07:08.000
to indecent assault and battery.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
What about the two other women
Peter actually raped?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.160
He wore a ski mask.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.000
Oh. So they can't
positively identify him. &gt;

07:16.000 --> 07:17.480
And the best part is,

07:17.480 --> 07:20.680
the judge released Peter on his own
recognizance until the trial.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.960
No bail?

07:21.960 --> 07:23.920
That's right.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.800
And now I'm supposed
to forget all about it

07:25.800 --> 07:29.800
and spend the rest of the day
smiling at my patients.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.960
Hm.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.840
&lt; Well, better get to work.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.280
Oh!

07:38.280 --> 07:39.480
Nurse Rosenthal.

07:39.480 --> 07:40.200
Are you OK?

07:40.200 --> 07:41.360
Are you OK?

07:41.360 --> 07:43.880
Sorry, I just wanted to tell you
that Dr Levine's wife wants

07:43.880 --> 07:45.040
another shot of insulin.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.840
I'll take care of it.  Thanks.

07:46.840 --> 07:47.880
Are you sure you're OK?

07:47.880 --> 07:51.880
Are you sure you're OK?

07:59.160 --> 08:03.160
Oh.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.800
Dr Barton?

08:08.800 --> 08:10.640
Here are Kevin Hooper's
test results.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.360
A non-functioning mass
showed up on the testicular scan

08:13.360 --> 08:15.480
and appears solid on the ultrasound.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.480
Slight elevation alpha-fetoprotein,

08:18.480 --> 08:22.480
beta HCG negative, chest X-ray
negative, CAT scan negative.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.440
Schedule surgery
for later this afternoon.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.520
I'll have to remove
the malignant testicle.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.160
Throw this in his chart.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.000
Looking good, Mr Murphy.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.240
If I find a pure seminoma,
there's an end to it.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.640
You'll talk to Kevin?

08:36.640 --> 08:38.320
I'm in O.R. the rest of the morning.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.120
I won't see him until just before
surgery, you'll have to tell him.

08:41.120 --> 08:45.120
But, Dr Barton,
I don't think I'm the one who...

08:45.680 --> 08:47.520
I was taking a throw
from the shortstop, &gt;

08:47.520 --> 08:50.960
when one of the big kids slid
into me at second.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.840
And on the first day
of outdoor recess too.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.120
Did you tag him out?

08:55.120 --> 08:55.720
Double play.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.640
Double play.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.080
Three over four swelling
to the lateral malleolus,

09:01.080 --> 09:03.840
indicating forced inversion injury.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.200
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

09:05.200 --> 09:06.680
You sure you're a real doctor?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.600
If I'm not, I wasted a lot of time
and money in med school.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.680
I've never seen a doctor wearing
a baseball hat before.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.800
This is my lucky hat.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.800
I wear this for protection
against the forces of evil.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.360
All right, take him down to X-ray,

09:18.360 --> 09:20.440
we need an AP and a lateral
of his ankle. &gt;

09:20.440 --> 09:21.240
AP and lateral, check.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.840
AP and lateral, check.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.600
X-rays are radioactive.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.160
X-rays are radioactive.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.440
There's no such thing as an
acceptable level of contamination.

09:30.440 --> 09:34.200
Well, we need to see
if anything's broken. It won't hurt.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.920
I promise.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.680
Then, can I wear your hat?

09:37.680 --> 09:39.840
My hat? What for?

09:39.840 --> 09:43.640
Protection against
the forces of evil.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.400
No.  Please.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.400
&lt; Couldn't he just wear it
down to X-ray?

09:47.400 --> 09:49.520
This hat never leaves my head.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.440
Even when you shower?

09:50.440 --> 09:54.440
Even when you shower?

09:54.560 --> 09:58.560
All right, Elliot, but I'm holding
you personally responsible.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.000
Did I tell you Myra came
to see me? &gt;

10:15.000 --> 10:17.440
Did I tell you Myra came
to see me? &gt;

10:17.440 --> 10:21.440
Something must have come up.

10:21.840 --> 10:25.280
Ha-ha. Man, I'll tell you something,
it's good to be home.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.960
Myra!

10:27.960 --> 10:31.600
Honey!

10:31.600 --> 10:33.640
Wait right there. I just want
to change before we go back.

10:33.640 --> 10:34.720
Wait right there. I just want
to change before we go back.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.720
&lt; Myra!

10:40.080 --> 10:43.440
&lt; Myra!

10:43.440 --> 10:47.440
&lt; Myra!

10:49.960 --> 10:53.960
Hmm.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.240
Myra?

11:03.280 --> 11:05.280
They're gone.  What?

11:05.280 --> 11:08.520
The toys and the clothes
and everything, just gone.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.160
When Myra came to see you,
did she...?

11:10.160 --> 11:13.200
When Myra came to see you,
did she...?

11:13.200 --> 11:15.240
&lt; I mean, I did most of the talking.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.640
I told her that...

11:18.640 --> 11:20.360
I loved her
and how much she meant to me.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.800
&lt; Huh.

11:21.800 --> 11:25.800
What? Does she think I'm guilty?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.720
How could she do that?

11:27.720 --> 11:31.160
Well, I don't know why she left,
Peter, but it's...

11:31.160 --> 11:34.640
probably not what you're thinking.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.640
Myra loves you too much.  Right.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.960
Look, you go on
and I'll catch up with you.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.080
What?

11:43.080 --> 11:47.080
Yeah. Go on, go on. I'll catch up
with you at the hospital.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.840
Peter?

11:53.840 --> 11:54.840
You sure? &gt;

11:54.840 --> 11:57.280
You sure? &gt;

11:57.280 --> 12:01.280
OK.

12:13.280 --> 12:17.280
APPLAUSE

12:20.680 --> 12:24.120
It was at the urging
of my husband's mother

12:24.120 --> 12:27.080
to join the Women's Auxiliary
at St. Eligius.

12:27.080 --> 12:31.080
She was always inspiring me
to do charitable acts and,

12:31.120 --> 12:35.120
I must admit, I've found enormous
pleasure in this past year. &gt;

12:36.160 --> 12:38.960
St. Eligius's financial problems
are far... &gt;

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
You mean to tell me,
there's nothing we can do about it?

12:40.960 --> 12:42.720
You mean to tell me,
there's nothing we can do about it?

12:42.720 --> 12:43.920
The court was very clear,

12:43.920 --> 12:47.160
we've been ordered to let White
re-enter the residency programme.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.800
I don't like it any more
than you do, Donald.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.080
But the fact remains

12:51.080 --> 12:54.240
that Peter White is yet
to be convicted of a crime.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.240
&lt; We live in a country
where a person is innocent
until proven otherwise.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.840
I present St. Eligius
with an endowment

13:00.840 --> 13:03.440
in the name
of my beloved mother-in-law.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.720
Well, I can't believe
he wants to come back here.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.720
We can send him
anywhere we choose, right?

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
Of course.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.320
Of course.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.120
..to the sum of ¤50,000.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.120
APPLAUSE

13:18.800 --> 13:22.800
And, in her memory,
I dedicate her bust.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.880
APPLAUSE

13:31.120 --> 13:35.120
Once again, Mrs Jesmer and
Mr Jesmer, thank you from everyone

13:35.200 --> 13:38.800
at St. Eligius
for your generous contribution.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.480
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
would you please join us all

13:41.480 --> 13:42.880
for some champagne.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.880
for some champagne.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.120
&lt; How do we explain White's presence
to the women who work here?

13:50.120 --> 13:52.920
Convincing them that he's within
his constitutional rights

13:52.920 --> 13:54.800
isn't going to make them feel
any safer.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.320
No need to kill the messenger,
Dr Westphall.

13:56.320 --> 13:57.440
No need to kill the messenger,
Dr Westphall.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.560
Well, let's go
and get some of the champagne.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.640
Excellent speech, Mrs Jesmer.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.760
Excellent speech, Mrs Jesmer.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.760
Do you think Mother Jesmer
would have liked it?

14:04.760 --> 14:05.840
Undoubtedly.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.960
Undoubtedly.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.480
I tell you something, from the minute
he walks in that door,

14:11.480 --> 14:13.880
I'm going to have somebody
following him everywhere.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.440
He's not wandering
through these halls scaring people.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.880
His lawyers could sue
for harassment.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.400
His lawyers could sue
for harassment.

14:19.400 --> 14:19.920
Care for some champagne? &gt;

14:19.920 --> 14:21.280
Care for some champagne? &gt;

14:21.280 --> 14:22.080
Donald?

14:22.080 --> 14:26.080
Donald?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.400
Well, how did I do?

14:32.400 --> 14:34.760
Doctor Barton and I agree
that there's an irregularity

14:34.760 --> 14:37.080
on your right testicle.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.880
What do you mean?

14:38.880 --> 14:39.920
A tumour.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.920
The tests indicate
some kind of carcinoma.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.080
I got cancer?

14:46.080 --> 14:50.080
There's a chance
that the tumour's benign.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.640
I suppose that means radiation or
chemo, I'll be bald for graduation.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.840
We have to operate.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.920
I've scheduled surgery
for this afternoon. &gt;

14:59.920 --> 15:03.120
So fast? You just checked me in
last night and now you want to...

15:03.120 --> 15:05.680
We need to identify the type
of tumour as soon as possible.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.880
What? Am I going to die?

15:06.880 --> 15:10.240
I think we caught it
in the early stages.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.480
So, what are you going to do?

15:11.480 --> 15:13.840
You're going to scrape the lump off
and sew me up?

15:13.840 --> 15:16.800
It's not that simple.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.480
Your testicle has to be removed.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.480
If we find that the mass
is well localised, &gt;

15:22.480 --> 15:23.640
then it's not as serious &gt;

15:23.640 --> 15:27.640
and your chances for recovery
are excellent. &gt;

15:27.880 --> 15:31.280
Sounds pretty damn serious to me.

15:31.280 --> 15:35.240
You ready?

15:35.240 --> 15:36.400
Ooh.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.480
You wanted to know what dipping
your hand in paraffin feels like.

15:39.480 --> 15:43.120
Yeah, it feels kind of nice.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.720
Hey, Dr Chandler, could you get us
a bottle of champagne,

15:45.720 --> 15:49.720
dim the lights, maybe put on
a little Barry White.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.600
Hey, wait a minute,
I was just getting relaxed.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.040
We'll wait until it dries,
then we'll do it again.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.520
Luther, don't you have something
better to do with your time?

15:58.520 --> 16:00.400
Oh, not in my wildest dreams.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.800
I think it's hard enough,
so let's do it again.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.800
Ooh, when hot wax is joined together,
let no man separate.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.760
Now. Luther.

16:17.520 --> 16:21.520
Amanda, I'll never wash this hand.

16:22.160 --> 16:26.160
(GIGGLES)

16:26.440 --> 16:30.160
Look, I'm, erm, sorry
about what happened this morning.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.200
I understand.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.600
I thought I'd make it up to you.
I traded shifts with Jack
this evening, so we...

16:34.600 --> 16:36.160
Phil.

16:36.160 --> 16:40.160
I'm going to a party with Luther.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.400
Dr Ridley,
can I bother you for a minute?

16:54.400 --> 16:58.400
Sure. Come on in.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.720
I've stopped dreaming in colour.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.839
Don't you think that means something?

17:06.839 --> 17:10.839
Probably. Here, have a seat.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.240
I wonder what that does mean.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.480
I know everyone thinks I'm lonely
and that I'm paranoid.

17:17.480 --> 17:21.359
Actually, I'm a very open person,
but he knows everything about me,

17:21.359 --> 17:23.440
where I live, where I work,
the hours I keep.

17:23.440 --> 17:27.440
Damn it, I don't want to give
Peter White a reason to hurt me.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.920
Cathy, you have every reason
to feel confused,

17:29.920 --> 17:33.920
a terrible, terrible thing
has happened to you.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.360
You probably feel like
you've lost some sense of control

17:36.360 --> 17:40.360
over your life.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.800
Am I close?

17:43.800 --> 17:45.960
You see, I don't think
you'll feel so helpless

17:45.960 --> 17:49.960
if you work real hard to try
and get that sense of control back.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.240
I know that, intellectually.

17:54.240 --> 17:58.120
But, in my heart,
I've got to stop being afraid.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.040
I've got to do something to make sure
I know that he won't attack me.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.320
Or anyone else again.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.960
That makes perfect sense.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.440
I want to testify
against him in court.

18:10.440 --> 18:13.680
I'm the only one who can give
a positive identification.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.840
I pulled the ski mask off.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.040
I'd say you'd better testify,

18:19.040 --> 18:23.040
if only to restore
your own sense of dignity and worth.

18:23.520 --> 18:27.520
I'd just like to dream
in colour again.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.880
Nurse Daniels,
have you seen Dr Fiscus?

18:39.880 --> 18:41.720
He went to the bank.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.960
Elliot?  Yes.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.680
Your patient's been
in a car accident,

18:44.680 --> 18:46.080
you need to check for kidney damage,
what do you do?

18:46.080 --> 18:48.040
you need to check for kidney damage,
what do you do?

18:48.040 --> 18:51.080
Right.
I need a complete urinalysis STAT.

18:51.080 --> 18:55.080
STAT.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.640
Ah!

19:48.640 --> 19:50.520
My God.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.400
God. Urgh!

19:52.400 --> 19:56.400
He's going to kill me.

20:12.760 --> 20:16.760
Slow down, Elliot.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.200
200 degrees.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.360
Ten minutes.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.400
That ought to do it.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.640
I resent doing
another doctor's dirty work.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.640
Isaac Barton is a busy surgeon &gt;

20:30.640 --> 20:32.600
and I'm sure he'll see this patient
when he can.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.680
and I'm sure he'll see this patient
when he can.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.800
Annie, giving bad news
is part of the job. &gt;

20:35.800 --> 20:37.480
Next to the hours,
it's the worst part,

20:37.480 --> 20:39.240
but you do it all the time,
we all do.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.960
If Barton gets in there
and finds embryonal carcinoma.

20:41.960 --> 20:45.960
Annie, you didn't give the boy
this disease.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.680
I can talk about treating cancer,

20:50.680 --> 20:52.360
but I can't talk
about being a young man.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.800
but I can't talk
about being a young man.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.440
You're a woman, so you can't know
what this means to him, huh?

20:56.440 --> 20:58.800
I don't buy that.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.680
Fine.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.400
Annie? &gt;

21:03.400 --> 21:05.720
If a boyfriend of yours
had the same operation,

21:05.720 --> 21:07.480
would it make any difference to you?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.000
Maybe.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.920
I don't feel very good about that.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.920
You shouldn't.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.760
Oh, OK, over here.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.040
Why don't you put them
on the counter, right there.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.760
Thank you.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.040
Well, isn't that nice?

21:31.040 --> 21:33.840
You can always tell what the season
is by the flower arrangements.

21:33.840 --> 21:36.240
After a long winter
of chrysanthemums and dried leaves,

21:36.240 --> 21:38.080
it's so nice to see tulips again,
isn't it?

21:38.080 --> 21:42.080
Here's Mr Armand Trod's
medication schedule.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.200
It's not fair.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.360
It's not fair.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.760
How can somebody eat a whole box
of crullers and stay so thin?

21:47.760 --> 21:48.800
How can somebody eat a whole box
of crullers and stay so thin?

21:48.800 --> 21:49.920
(SNIFFS)

21:49.920 --> 21:52.560
Do you smell something burning?

21:52.560 --> 21:55.800
Ah!

21:55.800 --> 21:59.800
Oh!

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Oh! Ah-ah.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.240
My God!

22:06.240 --> 22:08.640
ALARM RINGS

22:08.640 --> 22:12.640
What on Earth is going on?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.040
Dr Westphall?

22:20.040 --> 22:22.640
Dr Westphall?

22:22.640 --> 22:24.040
I'm going to make this quick

22:24.040 --> 22:26.720
because I can't stand being
in the same room with you.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.360
Oh, so you think I'm guilty?

22:28.360 --> 22:29.680
You're damn right I do.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.280
I don't know what loophole
your crawled through to get in...

22:31.280 --> 22:33.000
I don't know what loophole
your crawled through to get in...

22:33.000 --> 22:36.040
I've been doing nothing but listening
to your problems for a year.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.880
I gave you every chance in the book &gt;

22:37.880 --> 22:40.600
because, for some stupid reason,
I thought you deserved them.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.800
Now I'm going to get
the "I let you down" lecture.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.560
No. No, not me.

22:45.560 --> 22:49.080
This hospital. Do you have any idea
the damage you've caused?

22:49.080 --> 22:52.440
You violated a trust.
You've made us all suspect.

22:52.440 --> 22:56.440
I feel I've been sheltering an animal
here, these past months.

22:56.560 --> 23:00.560
Is there an official reason
for this meeting?

23:01.400 --> 23:04.640
From the time you leave this office,
there's going to be a security guard

23:04.640 --> 23:08.640
on your back,
every minute you're on call.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.520
Anything else?

23:12.520 --> 23:16.520
You step out of line once,
I'm going to break you in two.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.320
Hoops.  Yo.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.000
Savouring the ambiance.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.600
For you, chief.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.920
All these sick people
in one place, urgh.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.280
What are they keeping you
here for, anyway?

23:35.280 --> 23:36.520
A few more tests.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.640
A few more tests.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.240
What kind of tests? &gt;

23:40.240 --> 23:41.840
Since when do they keep you
overnight

23:41.840 --> 23:44.880
for taking a shot
below the belt, huh?

23:44.880 --> 23:46.640
Guys, I'm kind of tired.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.120
Erm, can we talk tomorrow?

23:48.120 --> 23:51.560
Hoops, we are packing for
Hilton Head, when are they
letting you out of here?

23:51.560 --> 23:52.800
I don't know.

23:52.800 --> 23:56.000
Wh...? Hoops, we have a tradition
of debauchery to uphold.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.560
Yah.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.720
I'm not going.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.400
I'm not going.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.680
You're not going?

24:02.680 --> 24:04.520
Still got to pay
your share of the deposit.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.760
Money is
all this clown thinks about.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.560
Why don't we take up the great
debate of last month's phone bill, &gt;

24:09.560 --> 24:10.280
while we we're at it. &gt;

24:10.280 --> 24:13.040
while we we're at it. &gt;

24:13.040 --> 24:14.080
You what?

24:14.080 --> 24:17.040
One of my testicles.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.040
Come on, Kev, that's not even funny.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.600
No, that's the good news.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.440
The bad news is, if it's spread,

24:22.440 --> 24:24.800
they're going to cut
from here to here

24:24.800 --> 24:27.000
and they're going to take out
a bunch of lymph nodes

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
and, if I'm real lucky...

24:29.000 --> 24:30.440
I'll live.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.640
&lt; All he did was knee you, man.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.120
When are they going to operate?

24:35.120 --> 24:37.680
Today.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.320
Well, I wouldn't let them. &gt;

24:39.320 --> 24:43.320
I'd get a second opinion at a real
hospital, like, er, Boston General.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.640
I don't need a second opinion,

24:45.640 --> 24:47.520
they're going to cut off
my testicle.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.120
This hospital smell is
really getting to me.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.480
You coming, Ryan?

24:52.480 --> 24:55.280
Yeah.

24:55.280 --> 24:59.280
Kevin.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.320
You're kidding, right?

25:09.320 --> 25:11.320
I didn't do it on purpose,
it was an accident.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.720
Do you have any idea
what you've done.

25:13.720 --> 25:14.960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.080
Elliot, this wasn't just a hat,
this was a way of life.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.240
Elliot, this wasn't just a hat,
this was a way of life.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.280
You can't
replace something that's priceless.

25:20.280 --> 25:20.400
You know who gave me that hat?

25:20.400 --> 25:22.720
You know who gave me that hat?

25:22.720 --> 25:23.240
He did?

25:23.240 --> 25:24.600
He did?

25:24.600 --> 25:27.560
I stole it from him
after a game in Fenway in 1979.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.520
Oh, Wayne. I didn't know, I'll make
it up to you somehow, I promise.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.880
No, no.  I'll do it.

25:31.880 --> 25:32.960
We need you, Wayne. &gt;

25:32.960 --> 25:35.320
Elliot, I was your friend,
even though you're stupid,

25:35.320 --> 25:39.320
fat, incompetent, I was still
your friend and you betrayed me.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.440
Luther, I've got something
I want you to do.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.880
Oh, I can't right now,
I'm watching little Pete.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.520
I'm doing my Michael Jackson routine.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.840
Don't you have something better
to do with your time?

26:19.840 --> 26:23.000
Babysitting for little Pete is fine,
at least you're helping someone.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.240
But spending the rest of your day
shucking and jiving

26:25.240 --> 26:29.240
and clowning around is pathetic.

26:29.400 --> 26:33.400
Don't you want to do something
with your life?

26:40.440 --> 26:44.440
Hello, Kevin. I'm Dr Westphall,
director of medicine.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.000
If this is
another pre-operation pep talk,

26:47.000 --> 26:50.680
Dr Burton already told me,
it's as simple as opening an oyster.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.400
I'm in and out in 30 minutes.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.440
Are your parents aware
of what's going on?

26:54.440 --> 26:56.400
I'm sure they're going
to be happy to know

26:56.400 --> 27:00.400
their son is on his way to becoming
the daughter they never had(!)

27:01.160 --> 27:04.600
Kevin, this is a diseased organ
that has nothing whatsoever to do

27:04.600 --> 27:06.680
with how masculine you are,

27:06.680 --> 27:10.440
how deep your voice is or how many
children you're going to have.

27:10.440 --> 27:11.920
Business as usual.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.920
That's right. 100%.

27:13.920 --> 27:17.160
No change in your sexuality,
your fertility or your performance.

27:17.160 --> 27:21.160
See, Kevin, nature has
a wonderful pattern of redundancy.

27:21.840 --> 27:25.200
A man has two testicles,
but he only needs one.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.920
Yeah, and what do I tell
the next girl I go to bed with?

27:27.920 --> 27:29.680
She won't know.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.720
A prosthesis can fool even a doctor.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.640
I'll know.

27:33.640 --> 27:37.640
Yup.

27:39.400 --> 27:42.240
I can't help thinking that I'm being
punished for something I did wrong.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.640
I can't help thinking that I'm being
punished for something I did wrong.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.120
Disease can't be
a punishment for our thoughts, Kevin.

27:46.120 --> 27:49.360
If it were, hospitals would be even
more overcrowded than they are.

27:49.360 --> 27:53.360
(EXHALES)

27:54.360 --> 27:58.360
I'm scared to death.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.160
Wayne, you look different.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.440
How?

28:03.440 --> 28:05.520
You shaved your beard off?

28:05.520 --> 28:09.520
Oh.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.480
Mind if I join you?

28:11.480 --> 28:15.480
Mind if I join you?

28:16.960 --> 28:18.920
&lt; Her mum's up in the roof.

28:18.920 --> 28:22.240
&lt; (LAUGHING)

28:22.240 --> 28:24.840
Wayne, what happened?

28:24.840 --> 28:27.800
&lt; Don't. Just don't.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.160
So, how are the
wedding plans going, Bobby?

28:30.160 --> 28:31.920
&lt; You're getting married?

28:31.920 --> 28:33.120
&lt; You're getting married?

28:33.120 --> 28:35.560
Do we have to talk about marriage?

28:35.560 --> 28:38.320
Sorry. Still no word
from Roberta, huh? &gt;

28:38.320 --> 28:40.480
Her lawyer called to
find out who my lawyer was.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.480
I don't have a lawyer.
I don't even have a regular barber.

28:45.160 --> 28:47.680
&lt; Instead of eating it,
I should just attach it to my thigh,

28:47.680 --> 28:49.720
cos that's where
it would end up anyway.

28:49.720 --> 28:52.080
Ladies?  Hi.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.960
I mean, I just don't know
how you can eat so much at one time.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.080
I'm starved,
I haven't had a bite all day.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.840
Did you two hear the rumour?

28:58.840 --> 28:59.520
&lt; Which rumour?

28:59.520 --> 29:02.760
&lt; Which rumour?

29:02.760 --> 29:04.520
in the second year residency
programme next year.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.840
in the second year residency
programme next year.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.280
When I went from first year
to second, they cut ten people.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.440
It's a given
that not everybody's asked back.

29:10.440 --> 29:14.440
Which one of us
is going to get the axe?

29:14.800 --> 29:18.800
Here comes my vote.

29:19.680 --> 29:23.680
I'll get some air.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.040
Why did you rape me, Peter?

29:31.040 --> 29:34.920
You're crazy, everybody knows it.

29:34.920 --> 29:38.000
I never touched you.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.840
You're a liar.

29:39.840 --> 29:43.200
You're a despicable human being!

29:43.200 --> 29:47.200
SILENCE

29:53.280 --> 29:55.800
I want the special.

29:55.800 --> 29:59.800
Dr Barton has delivered
the testicle into the wound

29:59.920 --> 30:02.320
and is ready for, er...

30:02.320 --> 30:03.760
for removal.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.560
Thank you, Dr Ehrlich.

30:06.560 --> 30:10.400
There is an elevation on
the inferior portion of the testicle,

30:10.400 --> 30:14.400
approximately one by two centimetres
in area.

30:15.280 --> 30:19.280
The tumour's well-circumscribed
and appears to be non-invasive.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.120
Send this to pathology.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.680
Send this to pathology.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.000
You're skittish, Dr Ehrlich.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
Sorry, sir, but this procedure hits
me at the very root of my being.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.720
Prosthesis.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.720
Ah. Poor kid.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.960
We're saving his life.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.960
I know, but a marble
made of silicon gel, come on.

30:40.040 --> 30:42.520
They used to be made
of sterilised ping pong balls.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.320
Oh, great. Table tennis, anyone?

30:46.320 --> 30:48.720
Testicular cancer isn't
a joking matter

30:48.720 --> 30:51.640
for a man your age, Dr Ehrlich.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.440
Do you examine yourself once a month?

30:54.440 --> 30:58.440
No.  You should.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.360
Not now, Ehrlich.

31:02.360 --> 31:06.360
Yes, sir.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.920
Judging from the swelling,
I'd say you took quite a shot.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.480
Yes, unbelievably tender.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.400
Maybe I should have been wearing
shoulder pads.

31:17.400 --> 31:21.400
Maybe I should have been wearing
shoulder pads.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.880
How's that?

31:24.880 --> 31:28.440
It's sore.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.280
You came back way too early.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.760
Well, I was home the same length
of time after my mastectomy.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.960
Well, I was home the same length
of time after my mastectomy.

31:34.960 --> 31:38.960
Now, I want you to go home and rest.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.920
I couldn't stand being at home,

31:40.920 --> 31:44.520
all that time to think that maybe
I shouldn't have had this implant.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.760
all that time to think that maybe
I shouldn't have had this implant.

31:47.760 --> 31:51.480
Because it doesn't look exactly
the way I thought it would.

31:51.480 --> 31:55.480
Because I didn't really need it.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.560
It's not the same size
as my real breast.

31:59.560 --> 32:02.480
Because...

32:02.480 --> 32:04.840
Huh. Because, because...

32:04.840 --> 32:07.200
Look, Helen.

32:07.200 --> 32:10.040
You're never going to be able
to replace the organ that you lost,

32:10.040 --> 32:12.840
but you're jeopardising the shape
and position of the implant.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.560
You want to go through
all this again?

32:14.560 --> 32:18.560
No.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.200
Please.

32:22.200 --> 32:26.200
OK.

32:30.520 --> 32:34.520
&lt; I don't know what I'm going to do.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.720
I haven't had any sleep in two days.

32:38.720 --> 32:41.160
I have an emergency medicine exam
tomorrow

32:41.160 --> 32:44.360
and I haven't even cracked a book.

32:44.360 --> 32:48.280
I don't know how much more of this
I can take.

32:48.280 --> 32:52.040
I just don't have what it takes
to be a doctor.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.440
(SIGHS)

32:53.440 --> 32:57.080
Everyone thinks I'm a joke.

32:57.080 --> 33:01.080
I have one friend in this
entire hospital and what do I do?

33:01.080 --> 33:03.320
I set his hat on fire.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.560
His prize possession.

33:05.560 --> 33:09.520
So, of course, now he hates me.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.000
I don't know.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.800
I don't know what to do.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.000
I should've gone to dental school.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.520
I mean, there wouldn't have been
the drama of saving lives, but

33:18.520 --> 33:22.520
I bet there's a lot of satisfaction
in fighting tooth decay.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.640
Yeah. I mean, clean a few teeth

33:25.640 --> 33:28.400
and, Wednesdays,
play a few rounds of golf.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.000
It's not a bad life.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.800
Err.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.320
I don't mean to bore you, I'm sorry.
I just...

33:35.320 --> 33:38.320
You're the lucky one,
you're anaesthetised.

33:38.320 --> 33:41.400
Look at you, sleeping like a baby.

33:41.400 --> 33:45.400
No cares, no worries.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.400
No pulse.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.920
You have no pulse!

33:51.920 --> 33:55.440
Oh, Mr Gleeson,
so this is where you've been hiding.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.560
&lt; And I thought we'd lost you.

33:57.560 --> 34:01.560
Take him down to pathology,
will you?

34:08.360 --> 34:10.760
Excuse me.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.760
I must see a doctor at once.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.360
What seems to be the problem?

34:14.360 --> 34:17.199
It's about my steed.

34:17.199 --> 34:20.679
(HORSE SNORTS)

34:20.679 --> 34:23.000
&lt; We were on our way to conquer
and her legs bucked.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.920
I didn't know what to do,
St. Eligius was close,
so I brought her here.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.040
You won't let her die, will you?

34:28.040 --> 34:30.560
Wow, what's going on?

34:30.560 --> 34:31.719
This is Paul Revere.

34:31.719 --> 34:34.560
My name is Christopher Samus Paine,

34:34.560 --> 34:36.760
president of the Paul Revere Society

34:36.760 --> 34:39.760
and that is my ailing steed,
Unknown.

What do you expect us to do?

34:45.280 --> 34:47.679
It's all right, I'm here.

34:47.679 --> 34:51.600
Thought we could have expected
better treatment at the hands of
the Tories.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.080
She's lactating, isn't she?

34:53.080 --> 34:57.080
Yes, she's got a beautiful,
little colt named Minute Man.

Nurse Daniels, IV, normal saline,
250cc an hour.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.560
We're going to need a large bore
needle, 18-gauge should do it,

35:04.560 --> 35:06.400
and a red top tube.

35:06.400 --> 35:09.160
Fiscus, get these people out of
here, I need some room to work, OK?

35:09.160 --> 35:10.280
Do you know what you're doing?

35:10.280 --> 35:13.160
Do you know what you're doing?

35:13.160 --> 35:15.360
Is she going to be all right?

35:15.360 --> 35:18.160
She probably has hypocalcaemia.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.480
It's a calcium deficiency,

35:19.480 --> 35:21.840
it's expected in lactating
or pregnant mares.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.480
I'd never forgive myself
if anything happens to Unknown.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.600
She was named
for Paul Revere's horse. &gt;

35:26.600 --> 35:30.080
Heartbeat's about 60, it's a little
elevated, it should be 35 or 40.

35:30.080 --> 35:34.080
We wanted to walk in the footsteps
of history by re-tracing the root
of Paul Revere's Ride.

35:34.120 --> 35:37.320
This was a dry run so we wouldn't
get lost on the anniversary
next month. &gt;

The Midnight Ride Of Paul Revere?

Paul Revere didn't have to work
in the morning, there was a war on.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.080
Thanks.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.720
Shall I make it a little warmer,
Mr Barnes?

36:41.720 --> 36:44.120
Shall I make it a little warmer,
Mr Barnes?

36:44.120 --> 36:46.680
First class treatment, eh,
Mr Barnes?

36:46.680 --> 36:47.840
Amanda.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.920
Can I talk with you a minute?

36:49.920 --> 36:51.200
You'll have to wait.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.480
You'll have to wait.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.240
Still working on them, Mr Barnes.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.120
Should I turn on the jets?

36:57.120 --> 36:58.240
Yeah, give me a blast.

36:58.240 --> 37:02.160
I just want to talk.
I can't concentrate on my work.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.480
How's that, Mr Barnes?

37:03.480 --> 37:07.480
&lt; All I need is a pair
of water skis. Ha.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.200
About Luther.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.240
You didn't have to yell at him,
Phil.

37:11.240 --> 37:14.120
I thought we had something better
going, but you'd rather spend

37:14.120 --> 37:17.960
your time with some guy who plays
step and fetch it just to get
a laugh.

37:17.960 --> 37:21.960
You're really cruel.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.640
I don't get it. I don't get it.
What do you see in him?

37:24.640 --> 37:27.080
Someone who's not caught up
in himself.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.360
Someone who's not
so serious all the time.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.080
I'm a doctor, he's an orderly.

37:31.080 --> 37:31.520
So what?

37:31.520 --> 37:34.320
So what?

37:34.320 --> 37:36.000
telling jokes, that's not
what I'm here to do.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.480
telling jokes, that's not
what I'm here to do.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.600
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.360
I don't want to talk
about this any more.

37:43.360 --> 37:47.360
Could you turn down the heat?

37:51.120 --> 37:55.120
You know, I think you're better off
not going to that dance with him.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.040
But she's dead.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.600
What do you mean she's dead?

38:02.600 --> 38:06.160
I have an order for Mead,
for three pepperoni specials,

38:06.160 --> 38:09.080
somebody owes me 33.75 plus tip.

38:09.080 --> 38:12.560
¤33 for pizza?

38:12.560 --> 38:13.480
Extra cheese.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.080
Extra cheese.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.280
Now we're getting somewhere.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.880
Now we're getting somewhere.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.120
I just had a visit
with Kevin Hooper.

38:20.120 --> 38:23.720
Pathologist report showed
pure seminoma, no metastasis.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.240
I guess I didn't handle it very well,
but thanks for talking to him.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.920
I didn't say anything to him,
his body did.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.760
I didn't say anything to him,
his body did.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.920
A dream he just had.

38:32.920 --> 38:36.920
An erotic dream
about a woman named Annie.

38:37.040 --> 38:41.040
Night.

38:41.160 --> 38:45.160
(BABY GURGLES)

38:48.880 --> 38:52.880
&lt; I thought you left already.

39:02.480 --> 39:05.880
(SIGHS)

39:05.880 --> 39:08.240
How would you describe me?

39:08.240 --> 39:10.000
Smart?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.560
Silly?

39:11.560 --> 39:15.560
Funny?

39:17.480 --> 39:21.480
I don't know, I like you, I think
you're a nice guy, a good doctor.

39:22.680 --> 39:25.080
Average?

39:25.080 --> 39:26.360
Boring?

39:26.360 --> 39:27.520
Boring?

39:27.520 --> 39:30.840
That's what you think, right?
That's what you meant.

39:30.840 --> 39:34.840
Everybody thinks I'm just a nice
doctor, always on his P's and Q's.

39:37.320 --> 39:40.560
Always trying to maintain
a squeaky clean, professional image.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.080
Being a doctor's got nothing to do
with your personality.

39:43.080 --> 39:47.080
If you were a lawyer or a CPA, you'd
still be the same Phil Chandler. &gt;

39:47.360 --> 39:51.360
A dull, black guy
with no sense of rhythm.

39:51.440 --> 39:55.440
It's OK, so what? I'm a dull,
white guy with no sense of rhythm.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.840
Well, it's not a problem for you.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.520
See, I'm black.

40:03.520 --> 40:07.520
I'm supposed to be cool,
tell jokes, have a certain flair.

40:08.000 --> 40:08.640
That's ridiculous. Come on.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.000
That's ridiculous. Come on.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.440
You're stereotyping.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.560
Am I?

40:13.560 --> 40:17.560
&lt; (BABY GURGLES)

40:22.560 --> 40:26.560
All right, look,
I know you're just joking,

40:26.680 --> 40:30.360
but most people, I just don't live up
to their idea of what I should be.

40:30.360 --> 40:31.960
Well, that's their problem.

40:31.960 --> 40:35.080
Yeah.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.600
Yeah.

40:36.600 --> 40:40.600
It's mine too.

40:40.800 --> 40:44.000
You see, I grew up
in an all-white neighbourhood.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.800
Went to an all-white school.

40:46.800 --> 40:50.440
On the one hand, my black friends
feel like I sold out.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.480
Not white enough
for my white friends.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.080
People here at the hospital,
they don't think...

40:54.080 --> 40:56.680
People here at the hospital,
they don't think...

40:56.680 --> 41:00.320
You're exaggerating.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.320
Besides...

41:01.320 --> 41:02.680
Besides...

41:02.680 --> 41:04.400
I should just be the best person
I can be, right?

41:04.400 --> 41:05.920
I should just be the best person
I can be, right?

41:05.920 --> 41:09.920
Yeah, well. We can't all be
masters at it like you, Jack.

41:09.920 --> 41:13.920
Phil.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.680
Well, then,

41:18.680 --> 41:22.680
guess I'd better go run now.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.520
BANG BANG

41:27.520 --> 41:31.400
BANG BANG

41:31.400 --> 41:33.120
(HORSE NEIGHS)

41:33.120 --> 41:34.360
&lt; Get up.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.720
Up, oh!

41:36.720 --> 41:39.040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:39.040 --> 41:42.920
Calcium deficiencies have
some pretty frightening symptoms,

41:42.920 --> 41:44.240
but with the right treatment,

41:44.240 --> 41:46.520
the patient can bounce back
real quickly.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.200
Now, don't forget that diet
we talked about, OK?

41:48.200 --> 41:49.560
Now, don't forget that diet
we talked about, OK?

41:49.560 --> 41:51.240
We're going back
to the paddock tonight

41:51.240 --> 41:52.480
to rest up for the real thing.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.560
Thank you.

41:53.560 --> 41:57.560
Thank you.

42:05.480 --> 42:07.000
What did you think?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.320
I need a neuro check
on the woman in three, STAT.

42:09.320 --> 42:13.160
I need a neuro check
on the woman in three, STAT.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.560
What d'you think?

42:14.560 --> 42:16.200
Please, Elliot, you're in the way.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.600
Please, Elliot, you're in the way.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.520
Elliot, you did a good job,
but it's no big deal,

42:22.520 --> 42:26.120
we don't have time here for glory,
we just move on to the next one.

42:26.120 --> 42:29.520
Neuro check in three.

42:29.520 --> 42:31.800
Dr Fiscus.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.520
I'll replace that hat for you.

42:34.520 --> 42:38.520
You bet you will.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.640
(KNOCKS)

42:48.640 --> 42:52.640
Kevin?

43:09.880 --> 43:12.800
How are you feeling?

43:12.800 --> 43:15.920
Like a bullfighter
who just ran out of luck.

43:15.920 --> 43:18.680
Ha-ha.

43:18.680 --> 43:21.360
You should be halfway
to South Carolina.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.520
Ah, pfft, change of plans.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.640
Andy decided to go alone.

43:27.640 --> 43:30.360
And I thought Andy never had
any smarts.

43:30.360 --> 43:34.360
Yeah.

43:34.480 --> 43:38.480
When I was 15, my grandmother died
and I was real close to her.

43:40.520 --> 43:44.520
And my uncle said, erm,
"Toughen up, real men don't cry."

43:44.520 --> 43:48.520
&lt; And so I held it in all day,
through the wake and the church,

43:49.040 --> 43:50.480
&lt; the cemetery.

43:50.480 --> 43:51.880
&lt; Until, finally I got home

43:51.880 --> 43:55.440
and I went up to my room and, erm...

43:55.440 --> 43:59.440
I couldn't stop weeping.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.440
But I felt better.

44:01.440 --> 44:02.880
My uncle was a jerk.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.600
You run into guys like that.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.120
&lt; Yeah, everywhere.

44:06.120 --> 44:10.120
Kev, when you told us
what they were going to do to you,

44:10.760 --> 44:14.640
I could see you were scared,
but I was scared too, you know.

44:14.640 --> 44:18.640
It's, like,
it's like cancer was contagious.

44:19.400 --> 44:22.840
&lt; And I know it isn't, I know that,
but I was still scared.

44:22.840 --> 44:24.720
Welcome to the club.

44:24.720 --> 44:28.720
Cos it could happen to me.

44:29.600 --> 44:32.320
Kev, you're still a man.

44:32.320 --> 44:34.920
I'm a jerk.

44:34.920 --> 44:36.800
It's OK.

44:36.800 --> 44:39.840
Well, I'm sorry for not being
a better friend.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.440
And for kneeing you.

44:41.440 --> 44:45.440
You probably saved my life.

44:45.760 --> 44:46.880
What's that?

44:46.880 --> 44:50.880
Oh.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.280
Spring break.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.000
OK?  You clown.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.520
We're talking about some
industrial strength sun burning.

45:14.520 --> 45:17.160
As a matter of fact,
soak yourself, bud.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.560
Oh, thanks.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.360
Not far behind you, pal.

45:21.360 --> 45:25.360
You got the groove yet?

45:28.760 --> 45:30.840
OK, hotshot.

45:30.840 --> 45:33.200
You go long,
I'll hit you at the first palm tree.
