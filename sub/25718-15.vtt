WEBVTT

01:02.437 --> 01:03.646
Are you wearing it?

01:07.984 --> 01:09.694
I used to hate this scent so much.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.824
But it's growing on me now.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.856
You smell nice too.

01:50.026 --> 01:53.154
-I don't wear anything.
-I can smell it.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.698
Your scent.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.919
But what is this smell?

02:10.588 --> 02:11.840
Which one?

02:15.093 --> 02:16.219
Wait.

02:25.478 --> 02:29.482
What should I do?
I'm screwed. It dried out.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.904
Don't touch it.
It's still hot.

02:36.865 --> 02:37.991
I'll clean it up.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.371
And let's have cake.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.884
-Why is it one candle?
-It's our first day.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.389
-Blow it out?
-Okay.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.434
One, two, and three.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.146
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
<i>MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY! </i>BY KI MAENG-GI

03:16.529 --> 03:18.156
-Bottoms up!
-Huh?

03:19.574 --> 03:20.617
It's non-alcoholic.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.505
Here.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.301
-What's this?
-I bought it for you.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.269
I wanted to thank you.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.273
I turned you down twice,
but you waited for me.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.150
Take a look inside.

04:05.954 --> 04:06.788
Thank you.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.517
-Hello?
<i>-Where you at?</i>

04:28.142 --> 04:30.687
-Huh?
<i>-Are you okay? Did it go well?</i>

04:32.021 --> 04:34.983
-Why are you talking so loudly?
-It's crowded here.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.152
So what happened with her?
Didn't go well?

04:39.445 --> 04:44.033
Well, it did... go well.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.495
<i>Hey! Then you should've told me first.</i>

04:47.870 --> 04:49.080
<i>Who is she?</i>

04:53.042 --> 04:54.794
I'll catch you later. Bye.

04:56.879 --> 04:57.839
Hey, wait.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.634
Ah, I don't get it.
Why won't he tell me about her?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.433
It's Yoo-jin. He was there
when we had drinks.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.102
What if...

05:12.103 --> 05:13.438
he finds out about us?

05:13.563 --> 05:14.939
He probably won't say much.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.442
He will be happy for us.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.780
Don't worry. I won't tell.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.036
I'm still scared of people
finding out about our relationship.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.413
But...

05:31.080 --> 05:33.875
if we have to keep dating
secretly like this,

05:36.127 --> 05:37.378
it'll be sad.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.548
I'm sorry to keep you staying in
all the time.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.593
I'm fine with that.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.222
Should we just tell them?

05:53.227 --> 05:54.103
I want to.

05:55.229 --> 05:59.817
Hyun-jung, Woo-young, and Ms. Na.
We have already three people on our side.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.739
Isn't it enough to have those three?

06:04.822 --> 06:05.990
Don't push hard.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.117
I'm okay.

06:09.994 --> 06:10.828
No.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.414
I think I can do this.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.173
Alright, Mi-rae.
I can do this.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.801
Hang in there.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.563
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

07:20.064 --> 07:21.023
Nothing.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.248
Oh, you two arriving together?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.376
-I'm in a hurry, my stomach.
-We are...

07:43.337 --> 07:46.591
Is it a weird timing to say
we're dating each other to him?

07:47.341 --> 07:50.428
You don't have to tell them first.
If someone asks, then say.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.471
Okay.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.894
I don't think they will even ask.

08:00.605 --> 08:04.442
I don't think they are interested in us
that much.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.449
-Shall we go now?
-Yes.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.956
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.003
Eun, are you a close friend of Sua's?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.464
-Pardon?
-What do you think of her?

08:27.548 --> 08:28.549
What is this about?

08:28.633 --> 08:31.511
The other day, I saw her
alone with Tae-young.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.011
I saw them.

08:33.386 --> 08:34.472
What?

08:34.554 --> 08:38.893
Jung-yeob and Chan-woo fought
over her last night. My god!

08:39.684 --> 08:43.438
She says she likes Kyung-seok.
But she hit on everyone.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.982
Isn't it weird?

08:45.733 --> 08:49.904
Well... I'm not really sure.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.740
We need to ask Sua directly.

08:53.407 --> 08:56.244
If we do so, do you think
she's going to tell the truth?

08:57.161 --> 08:59.664
Tae-young doesn't pick up my calls.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.585
<i>Sua, where are you now?</i>

09:14.804 --> 09:17.807
Sua, you are like a model
whenever I take your photos.

09:17.890 --> 09:21.644
I hope you stop taking photos
without asking me first.

09:22.436 --> 09:25.147
Taking photos without consent
is illegal, isn't it?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.649
See you.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.126
-What do you want to say?
-Are you still stalking me?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.628
-What?
-You took my photos secretly.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.965
And you posted themÂ online, didn't you?

09:51.048 --> 09:52.049
You got me wrong.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.846
I shared them only on my group chat.

10:00.141 --> 10:03.185
Do you want me to report you
and get you thrown into prison?

10:04.520 --> 10:07.273
-Into prison?
-Liking me, and talking back at me...

10:08.858 --> 10:11.569
You are more pathetic
than I thought you are.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.195
Hey.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.116
Is there something wrong here?

10:18.367 --> 10:19.493
No, we're fine.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.503
Delete all the photos.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.757
-And don't tell anyone.
-What?

10:40.056 --> 10:42.600
Jeez, I can't believe this.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.237
DELETE

10:57.114 --> 10:59.575
DELETE THE PICTURE?
CANCEL / DELETE

11:11.587 --> 11:12.630
Hey, Sua.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.134
You didn't like Kyung-seok, right?

11:18.511 --> 11:19.345
Did you?

11:20.805 --> 11:21.722
What is he saying?

11:22.890 --> 11:24.809
Jesus, what's wrong?

11:35.069 --> 11:38.781
So far, we've searched
for our own personal scents.

11:38.906 --> 11:44.954
On the basis of it, today we're going
to make our own perfumes. Let's try.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.122
Okay.

11:46.580 --> 11:50.543
Don't think too much.
Simply try mixing your favorite ones.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.672
Actually,

11:55.548 --> 11:57.967
I don't think I'm really fond of perfumes.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.385
Why not?

11:59.468 --> 12:02.054
I prefer natural scent from skin.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.766
Something natural is better
than something artificial.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.936
Well, people have different tastes.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.690
You're allowed to take the perfumes
you make today.

12:12.857 --> 12:18.070
After three weeks,
your perfume will deliver deeper scents.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.998
You guys can also try making one
as a couple.

12:29.081 --> 12:29.999
Pardon?

12:37.381 --> 12:38.507
Did I misunderstand?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.509
Sorry, I got it wrong.

12:44.722 --> 12:45.556
No.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.187
-You were right.
-She's my girlfriend.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.149
Right? I thought I was wrong.

12:56.650 --> 12:57.735
Oh, my gosh.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.875
Tell me!

13:13.501 --> 13:14.543
Since when?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.504
It hasn't been that long.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.633
Awesome! Now I see.
That's why you were coming together.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.176
Since when?

13:22.259 --> 13:25.596
-Not been long.
-You've always been together.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.891
You came with Mi-rae
when I was with Yoon-byeol?

13:29.517 --> 13:30.351
Right.

13:30.434 --> 13:34.814
You could've just told us the truth.
You got surprised for nothing.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.691
I thought you guys were dating.
You look good together.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.110
<i>Good together?</i>

13:41.445 --> 13:45.324
-I'm so jealous.
-I'm jealous, too.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.081
I can't understand.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.376
How come he dumped you
and dated Mi-rae?

13:56.126 --> 13:59.213
Hah, do they really mean
that they look good together?

14:02.007 --> 14:03.551
What bullshit.

14:16.772 --> 14:17.982
So, this is it.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.068
You didn't have to be worried.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.372
You wanted to come outside
to hold my hand, didn't you?

14:33.497 --> 14:34.373
Huh?

14:36.709 --> 14:40.170
-Any other reason?
-Well...

14:40.796 --> 14:43.549
I thought Sua might feel uncomfortable
around us there.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.722
Why do we have to even care?

14:50.890 --> 14:53.225
-But still.
-I've been thinking.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.686
I want you to be less nice.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.899
I'm not as nice as you think.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.234
-Only idiots are nicer than you.
-What?

15:02.943 --> 15:05.654
-Hey, don't.
-See? It doesn't hurt at all.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.911
-Sorry. Did it hurt?
-See? Not strong enough.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.376
-Stop.
-What do you want to eat?

15:20.169 --> 15:21.211
Well...

15:23.464 --> 15:25.966
-There!
-Okay.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.811
Are you all right?

15:39.688 --> 15:43.317
-What do you mean?
-I just wondered if you were eating well.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.780
I didn't even date him.
I'm perfectly fine.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.699
Yes, you're right. All is fine.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.160
He seems to have low standards.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.668
-What?
-Can you stop saying such stuff?

16:09.718 --> 16:11.470
I'm impressed with her ego.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.682
She's weirder the more I look at her.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.206
It ended up being nothing.

16:40.290 --> 16:43.585
-I'm sorry to have made you uncomfortable.
-No, don't be.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.682
-This is good.
-Yes.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.727
He took mine.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.480
What's wrong?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.316
Nothing.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.111
Is it exam week?

17:09.444 --> 17:11.155
How can they be here now?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.618
I used to get jealous of such things.

17:21.707 --> 17:26.170
Hanging out together with boys
after school looked cool.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.593
It doesn't mean I wanted
to hang out with boys.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.638
Just... I couldn't get a chance.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.392
-Then do it.
-What?

17:40.476 --> 17:42.728
Do it. Do you still have
your school uniform?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.191
-Did you throw it away?
-Well...

17:47.900 --> 17:51.320
I don't think I did.
But school uniforms?

17:51.945 --> 17:53.655
I think I have mine at home, too.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.325
-You also want to?
-How can I let you do that alone?

18:09.421 --> 18:12.091
<i>I think something happened to your Dad.</i>

18:12.758 --> 18:17.262
<i>I'm going to take care of Kyung-hee.</i>
<i>I hope you take care of yourself well.</i>

18:17.805 --> 18:20.349
<i>You can drop by whenever you want.</i>

18:31.860 --> 18:34.571
MAYOR DO SANG-WON'S DAUGHTER DOES
A SHOW-OFF STREAMING.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.532
HE BOUGHT HIS DAUGHTER
AN EXPENSIVE BAG.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.790
There he comes!

18:47.292 --> 18:50.671
Mr. Mayor is not around here now.
So please leave.

18:50.754 --> 18:54.091
-Where is he now?
-Did he ever know about her video?

18:54.174 --> 18:57.136
Did she buy the brand-name bags herself?
Or were they gifts?

18:57.219 --> 19:00.889
-Could you give us an answer?
-Tell us something!

19:14.403 --> 19:15.737
I can't stand it any more.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.448
I need to ask her why she met him.

19:18.532 --> 19:22.870
She will never tell you the truth.
Do you think she'll admit that?

19:24.538 --> 19:27.332
People will think you're venting anger
after your breakup.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.171
But I want to at least hear her excuses.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.382
Wait.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.002
What is she doing?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.435
Is she try to throw up?

20:28.518 --> 20:32.564
She doesn't get fat because
she throws it all up after eating.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.816
I wondered about that.

20:34.983 --> 20:38.028
She never gained weight,
even after heavy meals.

20:38.111 --> 20:41.114
She used to go to the restroom
right after lunch.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.574
To puke.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.369
My gosh, I can't believe it.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.412
Hi.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.082
I think you're mistaken.

20:51.541 --> 20:56.338
The other day, I heard that
she used to have digestion problems.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.840
I also have the same problems.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.551
No, she checked out the stalls
to see if anyone was inside

21:01.635 --> 21:04.388
before trying to throw up.
I saw it all.

21:12.354 --> 21:16.066
Oh, my. Did you see her face just now?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.651
Creepy.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.743
Sua, please wait.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.585
Don't worry. No one will...

21:38.130 --> 21:39.673
You're driving me nuts.

21:41.591 --> 21:44.011
-Do you feel pity towards me?
-No, I'm just...

21:44.094 --> 21:47.180
Now that you're dating him,
you think your class has gone up?

21:49.641 --> 21:50.976
Do you think you're a winner?

21:56.857 --> 21:57.941
Hilarious.

22:00.777 --> 22:04.156
Do you believe you could've met him
if you didn't have the surgery?

22:04.990 --> 22:09.578
Even when he liked you first
you must have avoided him.

22:10.996 --> 22:15.375
You fixed your appearance, and now
you pretend not interested in beauty?

22:16.877 --> 22:18.587
You should be honest.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.924
And stop worrying about me.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.595
I'm not worried about you.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.935
And how dare you judge
how much I care about him.

22:35.979 --> 22:38.899
How would you know that
I would've given up on him?

22:44.029 --> 22:44.863
What if I do?

23:02.672 --> 23:03.965
Hi!

23:08.929 --> 23:09.930
Sua.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.520
She was caught while vomiting.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.438
It must be embarrassing.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.441
You guys always stick together
but you didn't know?

23:21.525 --> 23:24.653
She threw up each time
she went to brush her teeth.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.036
Sua.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.664
Hyun Sua!

24:01.273 --> 24:04.151
-I warned you, delete them.
-Delete what?

24:04.234 --> 24:06.570
-Just delete them!
-What are you talking about?

24:10.782 --> 24:14.161
We were taking photos of ourselves,
as today is our last day here.

24:19.749 --> 24:23.628
Sua, do you think I still like you
and stalk you?

24:25.005 --> 24:27.549
I deleted all three photos of yours.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.010
And I deleted my group chat.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.137
Happy now?

24:33.513 --> 24:35.182
Kyung-seok was right.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.351
I'm happy that he chose Mi-rae over you.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.273
Why are you so harsh on him?

24:43.857 --> 24:45.484
He liked you so much.

24:46.067 --> 24:49.404
Are you venting your anger
after getting dumped by Kyung-seok?

24:57.204 --> 24:58.413
So it wasn't him?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.166
He'll never admit it.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.554
How strange.

25:57.764 --> 26:01.685
The uniform can't be here with this.
Oh, I was wrong.

26:17.617 --> 26:19.744
I never wanted to see this uniform again.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.499
Ah, so sweaty.

26:38.388 --> 26:41.349
Yes, she stocked up.
Good girl.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.062
Gosh, I ate too much.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.233
Welcome home!

26:51.693 --> 26:53.695
Why are you sweating?
Did you work out?

26:54.154 --> 26:57.824
Yes, I did some stretching a bit.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.701
Feels like I'm gaining weight.

26:59.909 --> 27:03.872
Hey, you are tall. One or two kilograms
will make no difference.

27:04.581 --> 27:07.584
My body changes instantly,
even with 500 grams.

27:47.457 --> 27:48.416
Why are you here?

27:49.542 --> 27:51.211
You wanted to see me suffering?

27:51.961 --> 27:54.255
DAEJIN DAILY

27:54.339 --> 27:57.008
Your mom really got back at me.

27:58.051 --> 28:02.389
All this wouldn't have happened,
had Kyung-hee not run away from home

28:02.472 --> 28:04.516
and removed her mask.

28:05.350 --> 28:10.980
She never studied, just stayed in
and uploaded those videos.

28:11.481 --> 28:13.233
Actually I pitied her.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.778
-What?
-I was sorry for her.

28:19.823 --> 28:23.702
-What are you talking about?
-She wanted attention and love.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.954
But I couldn't do it for her.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.292
Mom is not to blame.

28:32.627 --> 28:34.045
You did all this.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.926
I don't want to listen any more. Leave!

28:48.059 --> 28:49.352
Good night.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.242
-Didn't have dinner?
-No.

29:05.368 --> 29:07.787
-Are you guys already having a fight?
-No.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.748
Then why didn't you have dinner with him?

29:09.831 --> 29:13.251
Kyung-seok said he needed to go somewhere.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.967
Hey, actually...

29:21.050 --> 29:23.720
-I told everyone.
-About what?

29:24.387 --> 29:25.388
That I'm dating him.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.933
Really? What did they say?

29:30.226 --> 29:32.896
Well, nothing reallyÂ in front of me.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.689
They congratulated us.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.693
Thank goodness.
Now, I can be relieved.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.700
I have always been a burden to you.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.285
No way.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.038
You had a hard time because of me, too.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.873
You taught me math.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.042
Right!

29:54.584 --> 29:57.128
I had to solve one problem three times.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.881
Hey, not three times. Twice.

30:00.006 --> 30:03.885
-Sometimes, it was five times.
-Try remembering it correctly.

30:18.441 --> 30:19.859
Be quiet.

30:21.694 --> 30:22.779
Be quiet.

30:33.081 --> 30:36.584
What am I doing, just to make
my stupid childhood wish come true?

30:56.396 --> 30:58.273
You look like a school uniform model.

30:59.607 --> 31:00.441
You, too.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.319
Pretty.

31:07.782 --> 31:10.076
I didn't know
you could make such a remark.

31:12.996 --> 31:16.249
-Why did you come out so early?
<i>-</i>Before Hyun-jung wakes up.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.252
She will tease me.

31:22.338 --> 31:24.257
By the way, where are we going to?

31:24.799 --> 31:30.555
Although now everyone knows we are dating
it will be a bit awkward to run into...

31:32.724 --> 31:35.226
-How about going to our middle school?
-What?

31:35.310 --> 31:37.103
I wanted to visit at least once.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.772
You did?

31:41.190 --> 31:43.610
<i>I have no good memories from school.</i>

31:47.864 --> 31:49.282
You don't want to go?

31:52.452 --> 31:53.453
Any place you want?

31:54.829 --> 31:57.540
Let's just go.
I want to go there.

32:11.512 --> 32:12.972
A lot has changed, hasn't it?

32:13.473 --> 32:14.515
Yes.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.852
Some have changed while others have not.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.025
Did we ever bump into each other
on the streets?

32:25.693 --> 32:27.195
I rarely went outside.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.239
I was stuck in my room after school.

32:32.533 --> 32:33.493
I was, too.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.961
Let's walk around a lot today.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.798
Can we do this in our uniforms?

32:48.049 --> 32:50.635
I see lots of students these days
holding hands.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.679
It's true.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.646
Wow, he's so handsome.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.648
Which school uniform is that?

33:04.065 --> 33:05.525
I don't think it's near here.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.611
That girl is from
Jaryong high school.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.572
Is she really a high school student?

33:11.698 --> 33:12.949
I guess so.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.117
Something wrong?

33:15.243 --> 33:16.202
See someone you know?

33:17.161 --> 33:18.121
No.

33:18.621 --> 33:20.081
No one can recognize me.

33:24.168 --> 33:28.840
Students seem to have finished exams.
They're all out here.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.527
-You don't like hamburgers?
-Yes, I do.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.404
Then why are you eating like that?

33:55.324 --> 33:56.492
It is too big.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.584
I won't look at you. Just eat.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.628
I'm not looking.

34:11.757 --> 34:12.800
Okay.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.559
Did you eat?

34:22.476 --> 34:23.311
Yes.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.531
Was that your one bite?

34:38.659 --> 34:39.619
Cute.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.543
Jung-yeob and the Mop
fought over Sua.

34:49.504 --> 34:53.341
Sua is just out of control now.
Okay, see you. Bye.

34:55.842 --> 34:57.136
-Chan-woo.
-Yes.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.431
I heard you were beaten up
by Jung-yeob, too.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.059
Who said that? Jung-yeob?

35:03.142 --> 35:06.646
-I beat him more.
-Now everyone knows.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.607
You fought over Sua with him
at the Berlin pub.

35:09.690 --> 35:10.566
Stop.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.069
By the way, what did Sua do?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.738
She made Tae-young
and Tae-hee break up.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.908
-What? For real?
-Yes.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.994
It was a huge fight.
He broke all the glasses.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.080
-Wow.
-Whoa...

35:24.330 --> 35:27.166
I never thought
she was hitting on everyone.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.502
I never knew that she threw up.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.087
-Throw up?
-Yes.

35:31.170 --> 35:34.257
She threw it all up
to pretend she doesn't easily get fat.

35:34.340 --> 35:38.010
You were her best friend.
How can you say such things?

35:38.094 --> 35:40.138
Hey, I'm also annoyed.

35:40.304 --> 35:43.057
People might think I'm weird
because I'm her friend.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.811
You are already weird on your own.

35:46.894 --> 35:48.187
Wait, what?

36:02.743 --> 36:04.370
<i>She threw up.</i>

36:05.746 --> 36:09.041
<i>She pretended to not get fat easily.</i>
<i>She lied!</i>

36:09.125 --> 36:11.460
<i>Jung-yeob and the Mop fought over her.</i>

36:12.962 --> 36:15.464
<i>She's so out of control now.</i>

36:29.854 --> 36:31.564
YOO EUN

36:58.925 --> 37:01.302
I'm Eun. What's up?

37:02.011 --> 37:06.057
-Why did you call me?
<i>-Just to have lunch with you.</i>

37:06.724 --> 37:07.558
It's okay.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.686
Please leave me alone.

37:10.770 --> 37:14.815
Then, can I just see you for a minute?
Where are you? Home?

37:16.859 --> 37:19.946
What do you want to hear from me?

37:20.029 --> 37:21.614
Nothing really.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.700
If you want to say something, I'll listen.

37:26.494 --> 37:30.665
<i>If I don't do anything right now,</i>
<i>I know I'll regret it.</i>

37:31.290 --> 37:33.084
<i>Sorry if I bothered you.</i>

37:47.306 --> 37:51.978
-This is where you were cleaning.
<i>-</i>Yes. It's when I misunderstood you.

37:52.853 --> 37:54.230
I made you misunderstand me.

37:56.232 --> 37:59.610
Have you ever seen me in other places
besides here and the bus stop?

38:00.611 --> 38:02.446
-Many times.
-Really?

38:03.656 --> 38:05.074
You were always alone.

38:05.992 --> 38:06.826
I was, too.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.958
Why did you hang around alone
without Hyun-jung?

38:15.042 --> 38:16.168
I was sorry.

38:18.879 --> 38:22.133
She used to fight many times with friends
because of me.

38:23.217 --> 38:27.263
That's why I didn't get along with her
at school.

38:31.475 --> 38:34.103
So we played at each other's homes.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.355
Sometimes we studied together.

38:39.025 --> 38:41.277
When I was with her,
I felt the most comfortable.

38:43.904 --> 38:45.573
I'd better be nicer to her.

38:47.825 --> 38:48.909
Like how?

38:51.162 --> 38:53.706
Buy some lunches?

38:56.042 --> 38:59.670
She's on a diet
to make a boyfriend.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.218
The classrooms must be empty now.

39:20.733 --> 39:21.567
Nothing's changed.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.864
Of course. It's only been six years.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.501
KANG ORC

39:39.293 --> 39:40.795
Really, nothing changed.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.049
-Did we have a basketball court there?
-Huh?

39:48.969 --> 39:49.845
Where?

39:57.520 --> 39:59.146
I couldn't do that either.

40:00.356 --> 40:01.190
What?

40:03.943 --> 40:07.822
You know, girls shout on the side
when boys are playing basketball.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.075
I also wanted to join and watch.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.077
But I couldn't.

40:16.705 --> 40:19.375
-You should do it, too.
-What?

40:20.459 --> 40:22.753
Let's go. You can cheer for me.

40:25.631 --> 40:27.258
You're going to play basketball?

40:27.967 --> 40:28.926
Right now?

40:29.718 --> 40:31.720
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.225
Can I play with you guys?

40:37.101 --> 40:38.018
Who is he?

40:38.102 --> 40:39.145
Who's that?

40:42.356 --> 40:44.400
-My gosh.
-He's so good-looking.

40:45.359 --> 40:47.278
-Can I play with you guys?
-Sure.

40:47.361 --> 40:49.488
-Let's play with him.
-How should we split?

40:49.572 --> 40:51.031
-Two against three?
-Sure.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.576
I guess he's really going to play.

40:54.368 --> 40:55.494
Pass.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.246
Block him.

41:00.082 --> 41:00.958
Good job.

41:03.627 --> 41:04.879
Don't you dare stop me.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.424
-My gosh.
-He's so good.

41:09.341 --> 41:10.843
Get the ball.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.138
Come on. Block him.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.102
Good job, Kyung-seok.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.062
-No!
-Come on.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.105
Nice!

41:24.565 --> 41:25.441
Hey.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.569
-Gosh, seriously.
-Do Kyung-seok!

41:28.652 --> 41:30.529
Do Kyung-seok!

41:35.701 --> 41:37.369
You were really good.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.247
You cheered pretty well.

41:41.582 --> 41:42.583
I know, right?

41:43.292 --> 41:45.794
I didn't know I'd be so good at cheering.

41:46.879 --> 41:47.713
Excuse me.

41:49.089 --> 41:50.508
Is he your boyfriend?

41:51.175 --> 41:52.009
Yes.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.220
-I'm so jealous.
-Me too.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.185
Shall we go now?

42:08.776 --> 42:10.611
-Bye.
-Bye.

42:12.696 --> 42:17.076
But didn't she call him Do Kyung-seok
just a while ago?

42:18.244 --> 42:20.746
Wait, I think I heard it too.

42:22.164 --> 42:24.083
So that's right.

42:24.667 --> 42:27.086
He's the legendary handsome boy
from our school.

42:28.712 --> 42:29.547
Awesome.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.174
What should we do now?

42:34.969 --> 42:37.680
Shall we eat and watch a movie?

42:38.097 --> 42:39.098
A movie?

42:40.432 --> 42:43.185
You'll be teased all day long
if you go back in that uniform.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.854
You should go late when she's asleep.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.274
You're right.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.462
Sua.

43:19.305 --> 43:20.681
Have you eaten?

43:20.764 --> 43:22.016
What for?

43:22.391 --> 43:24.184
I'd throw up after eating anyway.

43:26.061 --> 43:28.355
I guess everyone thinks
I'm a psycho now.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.066
I even lied to you.

43:31.525 --> 43:32.901
My grandma is alive.

43:34.737 --> 43:37.364
I once told Kyung-seok
that I had a grandma,

43:37.823 --> 43:39.283
so you must've known.

43:39.366 --> 43:41.577
He isn't the type who'd say such a thing.

43:42.745 --> 43:43.579
Right.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.498
He's not even interested in me.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.084
He cares only about Mi-rae.

43:51.754 --> 43:54.715
Do you hate her because of Kyung-seok?

43:58.093 --> 44:00.304
I don't think it's because of him.

44:00.763 --> 44:02.306
The way I see it,

44:02.765 --> 44:04.975
you've hated her from the start.

44:07.686 --> 44:10.356
That's right. I did.

44:11.857 --> 44:12.691
Why?

44:13.859 --> 44:17.863
Becoming pretty
isn't the only purpose of plastic surgery.

44:18.530 --> 44:21.450
They do it because they want to do
something afterwards.

44:22.868 --> 44:25.537
I had a close friend
when I was in middle school.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.916
She was good to me,

44:29.541 --> 44:30.668
like a servant.

44:31.543 --> 44:33.295
She had an ordinary face,

44:33.379 --> 44:36.173
but she got double eyelid surgery
as she entered high school.

44:36.256 --> 44:37.841
She became really pretty.

44:39.343 --> 44:43.347
And she dated a guy
whom I had a crush on,

44:45.432 --> 44:47.393
even when she knew that I liked him.

44:47.476 --> 44:50.104
But you hated Mi-rae from the beginning.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.563
Because she's pretty.

44:53.357 --> 44:56.318
I guess I hated her
because her surgeries were done so well.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.245
Hey.

45:06.370 --> 45:10.374
Did you post a picture of the beauty
in my department

45:10.749 --> 45:12.543
-somewhere online?
<i>-No.</i>

45:13.001 --> 45:16.088
<i>I showed the picture to others,</i>
<i>but I never posted it online.</i>

45:16.171 --> 45:19.758
<i>By the way, I saw some pictures</i>
<i>that looked like her on the Internet.</i>

45:19.883 --> 45:21.385
<i>She wore the same clothes too.</i>

45:21.927 --> 45:23.345
What are you talking about?

45:37.443 --> 45:38.485
Hello?

45:40.112 --> 45:42.197
Hi, Won-ho. What's up?

45:42.281 --> 45:44.950
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

45:45.033 --> 45:46.118
What is it about?

45:48.495 --> 45:49.455
Now?

46:10.517 --> 46:12.311
-Hello.
-Hi.

46:12.644 --> 46:14.021
Did something happen?

46:14.563 --> 46:16.690
I think so.

46:17.649 --> 46:18.484
What is it?

46:19.067 --> 46:22.821
-You know who Hyun Sua is, right?
-Yes, I do. What about her?

46:23.614 --> 46:27.409
She said some strange stuff to me,
so I wondered what it was about.

46:31.580 --> 46:33.457
I found this.

46:38.420 --> 46:39.254
Who is this?

46:39.338 --> 46:42.591
Her face isn't in the picture,
but it's Sua. I'm sure of it.

46:43.592 --> 46:47.137
But she thinks I took this picture
and posted it online.

46:47.930 --> 46:50.015
I took another picture of her before,

46:51.266 --> 46:52.434
but it really isn't me.

46:55.062 --> 46:57.314
Please help her.

47:06.365 --> 47:08.992
We have to go catch the last bus
as soon as it ends.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.702
Let's go right after then.

47:10.786 --> 47:11.662
Okay.

47:12.329 --> 47:15.040
I can't believe
those little punks are dating.

47:31.765 --> 47:32.933
Don't mind it.

47:38.814 --> 47:42.067
They won't make it to college like that.
Gosh.

48:04.590 --> 48:08.093
Gosh, I hope my daughter isn't like that.

48:09.094 --> 48:10.262
Goodness.

48:13.432 --> 48:15.392
Whom did you mean just now?

48:19.062 --> 48:22.232
I was talking to myself.

48:39.625 --> 48:41.043
You've changed a lot.

48:43.003 --> 48:45.964
I told you before.
I usually don't get intimidated.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.864
Didn't you say
you don't usually get intimidated?

49:14.451 --> 49:16.286
I'm not intimidated.

49:28.298 --> 49:29.675
Why are you eating that alone?

49:44.690 --> 49:46.274
<i>It's gross.</i>

49:46.400 --> 49:48.151
<i>Are you a beggar, Sua?</i>

49:48.235 --> 49:53.407
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors
and make the loser kiss Sua?

49:53.782 --> 49:55.409
I might get sick.

49:56.493 --> 49:58.537
I heard her parents abandoned her.

49:59.037 --> 50:00.789
Poor thing.

50:01.206 --> 50:02.749
But why?

50:03.208 --> 50:04.251
-Because she's dirty?
-Because she's dirty?

50:04.334 --> 50:06.003
-Telepathy.
-We thought the same.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.588
How funny.

50:08.964 --> 50:11.842
-I'd abandon her if I were her parents.
-Same here.

50:41.413 --> 50:42.998
Don't you wash yourself?

51:13.487 --> 51:15.238
Make sure you wash yourself.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.620
You can go home alone, right?

51:24.539 --> 51:25.874
Finish that before you go.

51:27.626 --> 51:29.086
Don't go.

51:30.378 --> 51:32.130
Don't abandon me again.

51:35.884 --> 51:36.843
I can't do that.

51:39.971 --> 51:40.931
Why?

51:44.392 --> 51:47.562
You have no friends,
but I hope you do well.

51:48.605 --> 51:49.481
Mom.

51:51.316 --> 51:52.359
Mom.

52:02.244 --> 52:04.788
<i>Hey, is that Hyun Sua?</i>

52:04.871 --> 52:06.248
That's Hyun Sua?

52:07.249 --> 52:08.208
My goodness.

52:08.708 --> 52:09.918
It is her.

52:10.877 --> 52:12.671
I didn't know she was so pretty.

52:12.754 --> 52:15.382
I know, right?
Why did she look like that before?

52:15.507 --> 52:16.925
<i>I'm pretty?</i>

52:17.425 --> 52:18.927
Your skin is so fair.

52:19.010 --> 52:21.096
-Are you wearing makeup or something?
-No.

52:21.179 --> 52:24.349
Don't you think Sua is the prettiest girl
in the entire school?

52:24.432 --> 52:25.892
-No, I'm not.
-You are.

52:25.976 --> 52:27.894
Sua, this guy has a crush on you.

52:27.978 --> 52:30.313
-Hey, cut it out!
-What was that about?

52:31.773 --> 52:33.400
Hey, did you see that?

52:33.483 --> 52:36.027
-Her face looked so cute just now.
-I know, right?

52:37.154 --> 52:38.738
<i>To be loved,</i>

52:39.239 --> 52:42.367
<i>I must be pretty and cute.</i>

52:43.034 --> 52:45.704
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>I mustn't know that I'm pretty.</i>

52:45.787 --> 52:49.791
<i>I must be obedient,</i>
<i>and I should never be too smart.</i>

52:50.458 --> 52:53.545
<i>I must always smile and agree with others.</i>

52:54.379 --> 52:56.298
<i>I must always be kind and friendly.</i>

53:21.573 --> 53:22.616
Let's go.

53:22.699 --> 53:24.451
Right, the bus. We have to hurry.

53:35.170 --> 53:36.338
We're two minutes late.

53:37.297 --> 53:38.632
What should we do now?

53:40.050 --> 53:42.302
-Should we take a taxi?
-All the way there?

53:43.762 --> 53:45.680
Let me see how much cash I have on me.

53:49.476 --> 53:51.228
I have 26,000 won. You?

53:52.771 --> 53:54.773
If we're short,
I can bring money from home.

53:58.526 --> 53:59.778
Then I'll call a taxi.

54:07.869 --> 54:10.288
SEARCHING FOR A TAXI NEARBY

54:14.793 --> 54:16.378
NO TAXIS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

54:16.461 --> 54:19.339
-There are no taxis available.
-Then what should we do?

54:22.801 --> 54:25.845
Then should we just go to a sauna?

54:25.929 --> 54:27.138
A sauna?

54:27.597 --> 54:31.059
<i>Minors can't use our facilities</i>
<i>from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.</i>

54:31.810 --> 54:35.522
<i>We're actually college students.</i>
<i>Can't we show you our school ID cards?</i>

54:35.605 --> 54:38.316
SAUNA
OPEN FOR 24 HOURS

54:38.900 --> 54:41.736
I've only been here with my mom,
so I didn't think about that.

54:43.196 --> 54:44.906
Are there any cars going to Seoul?

54:48.410 --> 54:49.703
Okay, thank you.

54:54.791 --> 54:57.252
Shall we just go to my parents' place?

55:00.338 --> 55:01.840
It's not a good idea, right?

55:01.923 --> 55:04.175
-You should go home.
-Then what about you?

55:04.259 --> 55:07.387
I'll wait a few hours
and take the first bus.

55:07.971 --> 55:10.307
-Then I'll wait with you.
-Just go home.

55:10.390 --> 55:12.392
No, I don't want you to wait alone.

55:15.437 --> 55:17.188
Let's just go to my parents' place.

55:18.148 --> 55:19.816
We have no choice.

55:23.403 --> 55:24.904
-Just go...
-Hi, Mom.

55:26.948 --> 55:28.158
You're still awake?

55:32.162 --> 55:33.038
Where are you?

55:33.121 --> 55:36.291
We're at your grandmother's
70th birthday party.

55:36.416 --> 55:39.169
We can't go home now
because your dad has been drinking.

55:39.294 --> 55:41.546
-Who is it?
-Mi-rae.

55:41.796 --> 55:43.340
My pretty daughter?

55:44.174 --> 55:45.633
Mi-rae!

55:45.717 --> 55:48.345
Dad sounds really drunk.

55:49.346 --> 55:52.474
<i>-Is something wrong?</i>
-No, nothing's wrong.

55:52.557 --> 55:54.142
Then when will you come home...

55:54.309 --> 55:56.311
I mean, when will you go home?

55:56.978 --> 55:58.563
<i>Mi-rae, Mi-rae!</i>

55:58.646 --> 56:00.815
When can we go to karaoke again?

56:00.899 --> 56:02.650
Go in. Go inside, okay?

56:03.276 --> 56:07.113
By the way, why did you call me?
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

56:07.197 --> 56:09.783
Yes, don't worry. Everything is fine.

56:10.742 --> 56:11.785
Yes.

56:12.327 --> 56:15.330
Then tomorrow, come home...
I mean, get home safely tomorrow.

56:15.830 --> 56:19.084
Wait until Dad sobers up completely.
All right.

56:23.671 --> 56:25.882
My parents aren't home now.

56:38.686 --> 56:39.729
This is it.

56:46.319 --> 56:47.946
Did you live here back then too?

56:48.530 --> 56:51.658
Yes, we've been living here
since I was in elementary school.

56:55.537 --> 56:56.788
Shall we go in?

57:24.482 --> 57:26.943
This is where my family lives.

57:33.408 --> 57:34.784
Have a seat.

57:35.660 --> 57:36.494
Okay.

57:46.921 --> 57:49.757
I'll go bring something to eat.

57:50.300 --> 57:51.176
All right.

57:58.808 --> 58:00.268
SQUID

58:02.020 --> 58:03.062
This is squid.

58:05.398 --> 58:06.441
This is also squid.

58:08.902 --> 58:10.069
This is beef jerky.

58:12.280 --> 58:14.324
Gosh, they're all bar snacks.

58:15.450 --> 58:16.576
Are there any chips?

58:22.749 --> 58:24.501
TOMATO KETCHUP

58:28.838 --> 58:29.964
Soju.

58:36.095 --> 58:37.555
Do you want some soju?

58:38.806 --> 58:39.641
Sure.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.612
I couldn't find many snacks to eat.

58:52.862 --> 58:54.280
There's a lot here.

58:56.241 --> 58:57.992
Isn't the uniform uncomfortable?

58:59.035 --> 59:00.078
No, it's fine.

59:01.246 --> 59:02.914
Yours must be more uncomfortable.

59:03.581 --> 59:04.874
Get changed.

59:07.544 --> 59:08.545
I'll be right back.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:06.686
Hey!

1:00:09.272 --> 1:00:11.065
Hey, you can't.

1:00:11.691 --> 1:00:13.776
-Come on. You can't see that.
-Why not?

1:00:13.901 --> 1:00:14.736
Give it back.

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:16.738
A quick look. I know your old face.

1:00:16.821 --> 1:00:18.656
What's there to see? Give it back.

1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:21.951
No, you can't see it. Gosh, give it back.
Give it back.

1:00:22.035 --> 1:00:23.828
-Just...
-No, don't be like this.

1:00:56.194 --> 1:00:57.153
Are you mad at me?

1:00:57.987 --> 1:00:59.697
Yes, I am.

1:01:02.867 --> 1:01:04.118
I'm sorry.

1:01:34.232 --> 1:01:36.442
But there's something I'm curious about.

1:01:41.823 --> 1:01:45.410
How can you like me
when you know how I used to look?

1:01:46.452 --> 1:01:49.122
If I had kept that face,

1:01:51.332 --> 1:01:53.209
would you still have liked me?

1:02:00.133 --> 1:02:01.217
You're just you.

1:02:05.596 --> 1:02:07.056
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

1:02:12.687 --> 1:02:13.771
But...

1:02:16.941 --> 1:02:18.609
I do miss your old face.

1:02:38.588 --> 1:02:40.131
Then just for a moment...

1:02:42.467 --> 1:02:45.887
You can see it for like a split second.

1:02:48.556 --> 1:02:51.684
No, it's okay. I don't have to see it
if you don't want me to.

1:03:24.717 --> 1:03:28.012
Just for three seconds.
No more than that, okay?

1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:30.181
Here we go.

1:03:34.644 --> 1:03:36.979
One, two...

1:03:38.648 --> 1:03:39.565
Three.

1:03:46.906 --> 1:03:49.200
If you still like me after seeing this,

1:03:50.493 --> 1:03:53.788
that means you really like me.

1:05:39.268 --> 1:05:41.479
<i>I had my first kiss.</i>

1:05:41.562 --> 1:05:42.813
<i>-Who's he?</i>
<i>-Mi-rae's boyfriend.</i>

1:05:42.897 --> 1:05:45.483
<i>That guy is super handsome!</i>

1:05:45.566 --> 1:05:47.902
Her phone is still off.
I can't get a hold of her.

1:05:47.985 --> 1:05:50.905
It was obviously taken without consent.
Why can't you delete it?

1:05:50.988 --> 1:05:54.075
<i>A victim? No, I don't want people</i>
<i>to think weirdly of me.</i>

1:05:54.158 --> 1:05:56.869
I think Kyung-seok likes you more.
Am I right?

1:05:56.953 --> 1:05:59.205
<i>This would be a nice spot</i>
<i>to propose later on.</i>

1:05:59.288 --> 1:06:01.749
You said hi to me first. You smiled at me.

1:06:01.832 --> 1:06:04.502
-Do you know what this is?
-Have you seen Sua today?

1:06:04.585 --> 1:06:05.920
What did you do?
