WEBVTT

00:04.270 --> 00:05.862
Lemon?

00:07.107 --> 00:08.631
Which of these pictures
do you like better?

00:12.212 --> 00:15.115
Um... the one on the left?

00:15.115 --> 00:16.416
So the wacky one?

00:16.416 --> 00:18.685
Sure. What's the picture for?

00:18.685 --> 00:20.687
I'm giving the keynote address

00:20.687 --> 00:22.555
at the company's Six Sigma Retreat

00:22.555 --> 00:24.891
to Move Forward in Croton-on-Hudson.

00:24.891 --> 00:26.526
Oh, Is that like a corporate retreat?

00:26.526 --> 00:28.461
I used to have to perform
at those all the time

00:28.461 --> 00:30.395
back when Jenna and I were
in that improv troupe.

00:30.897 --> 00:32.499
The audience suggestion is...

00:32.499 --> 00:34.701
Sling Blade and Oprah on a date.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.541
I sure do like them
French-fried "pataters."

00:41.541 --> 00:43.532
No, you don't, Oprah.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.312
Jenna is not a great improviser.

00:46.312 --> 00:49.883
To be honest, Lemon, uh...

00:49.883 --> 00:52.010
I'm a little apprehensive
about going to this thing.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.587
I haven't seen a lot of these people

00:54.587 --> 00:59.159
since the C.E.O. debacle and my
time in the Bush Administration.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.860
Yeah, Jack, you never really told me

01:00.860 --> 01:02.225
what happened in Washington.

01:04.964 --> 01:07.000
Please be gentle.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.836
The point is a lot has happened to me

01:09.836 --> 01:10.970
since the retreat last year.

01:10.970 --> 01:12.472
So I hope that
when I return

01:12.472 --> 01:14.107
they still think of me as the same guy.

01:14.107 --> 01:15.442
You've got camp jitters.

01:15.442 --> 01:16.843
What?

01:16.843 --> 01:18.945
You haven't seen your little
business camp friends in a year

01:18.945 --> 01:20.080
and now you're afraid everybody's

01:20.080 --> 01:21.247
going to think you got weird.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.283
Uh, Lemon, the Retreat to Move Forward

01:23.283 --> 01:25.618
is a global meeting of G.E.'s
best and brightest.

01:25.618 --> 01:27.187
Careers are made there.

01:27.187 --> 01:28.455
It would be helpful to have

01:28.455 --> 01:30.190
someone with me who's got my back.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.492
Oh, no, don't make me be your camp friend.

01:32.492 --> 01:33.993
I hate those corporate things...

01:33.993 --> 01:35.962
a bunch of drunk people
talking about synergy.

01:35.962 --> 01:37.452
First of all, never bad-mouth synergy.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.300
And I'm asking you to do this as a favor.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.768
Oh, fine, I'll go.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.802
For you.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.337
As long as this place has a spa.

01:44.337 --> 01:45.605
They do.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.973
Where you are allowed to eat in the sauna

01:46.973 --> 01:48.270
because at some places, they get mad.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.131 --> 02:13.199
Writers?

02:13.199 --> 02:15.135
We need to gather for an actor announcement.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.337
As you probably know

02:17.337 --> 02:20.406
I have been cast in an upcoming feature film.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.842
Is it a movie where you swap
brains with your granddaughter?

02:22.842 --> 02:26.713
No, Frank. I will be playing Janis Joplin.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.381
Or depending on

02:28.381 --> 02:31.684
how some legal matters pan out,
a Janis Joplin-type character

02:31.684 --> 02:35.555
named Janet Jopler or Janie Jimplin.

02:35.555 --> 02:37.223
Why are you telling us this?

02:37.223 --> 02:39.726
Because I will be employing
the Method method of acting.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.461
So, for the next few weeks,
I will only respond

02:41.461 --> 02:42.996
to "Janis" or "Miss Joplin."

02:42.996 --> 02:44.164
If you're nasty.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.300
If anyone has anything to say to me, Jenna

02:47.300 --> 02:48.701
now would be your last chance.

02:48.701 --> 02:49.702
Oh, your hands are weird.

02:49.702 --> 02:50.904
I don't think you went to high school.

02:50.904 --> 02:51.971
I'm not busy Friday.

02:51.971 --> 02:53.006
I just said I was.

02:53.006 --> 02:53.995
Okay, I am Janis now.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.843
You are all saying those things to Janis Joplin.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.367
The veil is drawn.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.014
Oh, hey.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.348
You should do your Janis

03:02.348 --> 03:03.383
research on Wikipedia.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.852
It's online, so anyone can update it.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.820
You know, because people are
finding out new things

03:07.820 --> 03:10.023
about Janis Joplin every day.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.090
Really?

03:11.090 --> 03:12.692
Yeah.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.826
Thank you, Frank.

03:13.826 --> 03:17.421
"Wikipedia." I'm going to check that out.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.402
Okay, I'm on Wikipedia.

03:22.402 --> 03:23.503
"Edit page."

03:23.503 --> 03:25.738
Did you know that Janis Joplin

03:25.738 --> 03:29.609
speed-walked everywhere and
was afraid of toilets?

03:29.609 --> 03:31.711
I have heard that, yes.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.678
Was she really?

03:34.981 --> 03:37.217
So how am I looking, Dr. Spaceman?

03:37.217 --> 03:40.812
Well, Tracy, I...
I don't know how to say this.

03:41.921 --> 03:44.757
"Dee-ay-butt-ees"?

03:44.757 --> 03:46.659
Diabetes?

03:46.659 --> 03:48.428
That's it!

03:48.428 --> 03:49.861
Well, now we know what
we're dealing with.

03:51.097 --> 03:52.899
Unless you make some serious
lifestyle changes

03:52.899 --> 03:56.135
you're in danger of becoming diabetic.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.805
So how bad is diabetes, really?

03:58.805 --> 04:00.206
It's quite serious.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.975
If left untreated, you could lose a foot.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.745
Could I replace it with a wheel
like Rosie from "The Jetsons"?

04:05.745 --> 04:07.313
I suppose.

04:07.313 --> 04:10.714
But then, you'd have to register
as a motor vehicle.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.156
Well, buddy, here we go.

04:18.156 --> 04:19.926
Bases loaded, bottom of the ninth.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.229
Are you going to step up?
Oh, yeah.

04:23.229 --> 04:26.221
Because it's winning time,
you magnificent son of a bitch!

04:28.635 --> 04:30.603
You go in there and show them.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.972
Make Mommy proud of her big boy
because he's the best.

04:32.972 --> 04:35.108
Just do it. Is it in you?
I'm loving it!

04:35.108 --> 04:36.209
Are you okay?

04:36.209 --> 04:39.679
Oh. I'm sorry.
I was just, uh...

04:39.679 --> 04:42.649
Were you psyching yourself up
in the mirror?

04:42.649 --> 04:44.117
I do that sometimes before I go to a party

04:44.117 --> 04:45.551
where I don't know a lot of people.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.186
Stop sweating, you idiot.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.313
What is wrong with you, you stupid bitch?

04:50.523 --> 04:51.958
I wish you hadn't seen that.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.960
It's okay. Now you're ready
to get in there.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.657
You're psyched up, you've got
your camp buddy. Just do it!

04:59.332 --> 05:00.333
You are a lion.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.062
Take what's yours.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.377
There they are.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.012
The Six Sigmas themselves.

05:13.012 --> 05:14.213
They're dudes?

05:14.213 --> 05:15.915
Each of them embodies a pillar

05:15.915 --> 05:17.717
of the Six Sigma business philosophy...

05:17.717 --> 05:21.421
teamwork, insight, brutality...

05:21.421 --> 05:22.955
male enhancement...

05:22.955 --> 05:24.390
"handshake-ful-ness"

05:24.390 --> 05:25.925
and play hard.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.916
Wish me luck.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.099
Men? If I'd known your wives were alone

05:33.099 --> 05:34.157
I would have stayed in New York.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.406
Jack Donaghy. We've been waiting
all day for you to show up.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.941
Uh, this is my friend...

05:41.941 --> 05:44.068
The guys over in War Machines
have been dying to see you.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.215
The Finulus data suggest
we should be leveraging

05:49.215 --> 05:50.650
disintermediation paradigms.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.552
Well, obviously, the Finular analysis

05:52.552 --> 05:54.153
will concur with any synergized

05:54.153 --> 05:55.321
mindshare classifications.

05:55.321 --> 05:56.856
Bladorian frankles.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.458
Hi. I'm Liz.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.160
I am Prashant.
This is Joan.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.162
We're M-7s.
What level are you?

06:03.162 --> 06:05.365
Oh, no. I'm just here with my friend.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.400
Or I was.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.435
So you're like a "G" or an "H"?

06:09.435 --> 06:12.638
No, I'm not part of this.
I'm not any letter.

06:12.638 --> 06:14.572
"J"?

06:20.847 --> 06:22.348
Morning, Mr. Jordan.

06:22.348 --> 06:23.783
What's that on your foot, sir?

06:23.783 --> 06:26.986
It's a practice wheel for when
I lose my foot to diabetes.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.822
You can't eat candy if you have diabetes!

06:29.822 --> 06:32.425
There's no link between diabetes and diet.

06:32.425 --> 06:33.585
That's a white myth, Ken...

06:34.527 --> 06:36.662
Iike Larry Bird or Colorado.

06:36.662 --> 06:39.432
It's not a myth!
Gentlemen, back me up here.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.800
I don't know.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.535
My dad had diabetes and
he ate whatever he wanted

06:42.535 --> 06:44.303
until he died on the day I was born.

06:44.303 --> 06:47.507
How do you not see the connection?

06:47.507 --> 06:50.243
You know, there's a conspiracy
theory that after the Civil War

06:50.243 --> 06:53.179
the U.S. government spread false
information about diabetes...

06:53.179 --> 06:54.146
Word.

06:54.647 --> 06:55.982
...to keep the newly-freed
slaves sluggish and docile.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.950
And I heard that from Yusef Jackson.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.385
Toofer:... to this day

06:59.385 --> 07:00.620
most African Americans don't
understand that diabetes is

07:00.620 --> 07:02.247
caused by sleeping on your back.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.191
I don't think that's right.

07:05.191 --> 07:07.193
Diabetes and diet.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.195
Next, you'll be telling me that leasing a sports car

07:09.195 --> 07:10.753
is a bad investment.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.503
Hey, nice suit, Squaresville.

07:17.503 --> 07:18.704
Where's the bank?

07:18.704 --> 07:21.474
Uh, what can I do for you,
Miss... Jimplin?

07:21.474 --> 07:23.376
Well, according to my Wikipedia page

07:23.376 --> 07:26.479
I'm going to need some cherry
juice, buttermilk and tequila

07:26.479 --> 07:29.248
to make my signature Janis Joplin cocktail

07:29.248 --> 07:30.738
The Frankschlong.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.855
Good grief.

07:35.855 --> 07:37.190
Hey, Jack...

07:37.190 --> 07:38.558
where have you been hiding?

07:38.558 --> 07:40.560
Oh, Lemon, there you are.
I'm sorry I got distracted.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.196
Yeah, seems like you don't need
your camp buddy.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.464
I know. It's going great.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.732
I'm actually joining
the Six Sigmas for lunch.

07:46.732 --> 07:50.102
Oh. Okay. I like lunch.

07:50.102 --> 07:54.539
Right. Yes.
Well... join us.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.245
What is this?

07:59.245 --> 08:00.546
It's "LUNCH."

08:00.546 --> 08:03.115
Lego Utilization for Negating Crisis Hierarchies.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.184
It's a competitive team-building exercise

08:05.184 --> 08:06.953
where one person
directs his teammates

08:06.953 --> 08:09.522
in the construction of a Lego
model that only he can see.

08:09.522 --> 08:12.892
Lemon? Why don't you
join Team Donaghy?

08:12.892 --> 08:14.126
We'll win this thing and
then we'll go to class.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.561
I don't want to go to a class.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.029
No, Lemon, "CLASS."

08:17.029 --> 08:19.398
It's an acronym for Consuming
Lunch And Simple Socializing.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.730
Now, that just seems
intentionally confusing.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.976
K...

08:33.645 --> 08:37.650
What's up with this disgusting stuff?

08:37.650 --> 08:40.186
Mr. Jordan, I've seen too many
folks back home die of diabetes

08:40.186 --> 08:42.488
and Go-Kart accidents to sit idly by

08:42.488 --> 08:45.458
while you ruin your health.
You need to eat better.

08:45.458 --> 08:49.662
N-O-E... no! E.

08:49.662 --> 08:53.232
Okay, Mr. Jordan...
whatever you like.

08:53.232 --> 08:56.068
I just hope you don't get eaten
by the Hill Witch.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.770
Hmm, what's that?

08:57.770 --> 08:59.338
I didn't say anything.

08:59.338 --> 09:02.742
Oh, you want to hear a tale of the Hill Witch?

09:02.742 --> 09:06.279
My Mee-maw saw her once

09:06.279 --> 09:09.282
taking away a boy who wouldn't
eat his vegetables.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.651
She's a shriveled crone...

09:11.651 --> 09:13.819
1,000 years old.

09:13.819 --> 09:16.355
One look turns you to stone

09:16.355 --> 09:20.826
and then she gorges on your living brain.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.328
Through the stone?

09:22.328 --> 09:23.963
Well...

09:23.963 --> 09:25.965
Really, Ken?

09:25.965 --> 09:27.033
That was your plan.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.200
Doubt me if you dare.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.537
But beware the omens of her coming...

09:31.537 --> 09:33.673
crops will fail.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.641
Animals will run wild.

09:35.641 --> 09:39.912
And my page desk will be turned sideways.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.779
Ooh...

09:45.718 --> 09:48.354
Frank, you have got
to check out Maroney.

09:48.354 --> 09:51.380
Your Wikipedia
prank is inspired.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.360
Okay, Janis did it.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.622
You can do it.

09:59.532 --> 10:04.003
I'm gonna do it.
I'm going to eat this cat.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.004
Jenna, don't!

10:05.004 --> 10:06.005
That's from "ALF."

10:06.005 --> 10:07.006
"ALF" ate cats.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.541
What?

10:08.541 --> 10:10.509
I put all that stuff
on Wikipedia. None of it's true.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.211
Why would you do that?

10:12.211 --> 10:13.479
I'm sorry.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.181
I didn't know you were going
to take it so seriously.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.716
Well, of course I'm taking it seriously.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.352
This is my chance to win an Oscar.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.887
The Academy loves dead singers
and the handicapped

10:21.887 --> 10:23.356
and Janis was both!

10:23.356 --> 10:26.592
No, she wasn't. Her legs bent
the right way.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.661
What? I speed-walked home on these!

10:28.661 --> 10:30.029
You pathetic load!

10:30.029 --> 10:33.899
You mess with me because
your life is miserable!

10:33.899 --> 10:36.493
Because you're disgusting!

10:37.670 --> 10:38.938
What?

10:38.938 --> 10:41.340
Nothing, just... you're yelling
at me, you're a mess

10:41.340 --> 10:43.075
you're Joplin-ed out on tequila.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.744
It's kind of working for me.

10:44.744 --> 10:47.580
Ugh, are you turned on right
now? What is wrong with you?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.445
I've got a thing for damaged goods.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.719
But if you can get this raw in the movie

10:53.719 --> 10:55.254
you are going to win the Oscar.

10:55.254 --> 10:56.312
Really?

11:06.799 --> 11:08.401
Two minutes.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.603
Don't stop talking, Jack!
Always be talking!

11:10.603 --> 11:12.104
Hands in pockets, Joan!

11:12.104 --> 11:13.867
Prashant, your job is to watch Joan.

11:16.642 --> 11:18.577
Say something, Haircut!

11:18.577 --> 11:20.713
Uh, you can't have more wheels
on one side than the other.

11:20.713 --> 11:21.737
Uh-doy-ee!

11:22.548 --> 11:23.983
It goes on top!
It's a smoke stack!

11:27.219 --> 11:28.654
Yeah!

11:28.654 --> 11:31.257
Suck it, nerds!

11:31.257 --> 11:33.092
What happened to you, Donaghy?

11:33.092 --> 11:34.393
What do you mean?

11:34.393 --> 11:35.661
That woman is a subordinate of yours.

11:35.661 --> 11:37.997
Her behavior is totally inappropriate...

11:37.997 --> 11:40.900
the familiarity, nickname-ification.

11:40.900 --> 11:41.934
And you seem to encourage it.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.492
Well, Lemon is unique.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.473
Okay, but the old Jack Donaghy
wouldn't have stood for that.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.245
Sorry, I dropped it when I was
pretending it was my penis.

11:53.245 --> 11:54.906
Robot penis.

11:56.615 --> 12:00.574
We won!

12:05.357 --> 12:08.194
Oh, hey, Jenna.
Um, about last night...

12:08.194 --> 12:09.695
Oh, God.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.430
I just want to make sure you haven't

12:11.430 --> 12:12.598
told anyone what happened.

12:12.598 --> 12:13.833
I have a lot of irons in the fire around here.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.668
You'll keep it to yourself, right?

12:15.668 --> 12:19.638
Oh, yes. Of course.
Thank you.

12:19.638 --> 12:20.706
Yeah.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.509
Wait... I'm sorry.

12:23.509 --> 12:24.977
You don't want people to know about us?

12:24.977 --> 12:27.680
Oh, God, no.
I mean, it's so embarrassing.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.282
Yeah, for me. You should want
to brag about it.

12:30.282 --> 12:33.652
Don't worry about that. Last
night was stupid. Stupid, Frank!

12:33.652 --> 12:35.654
No, last night was the best thing

12:35.654 --> 12:38.624
that's ever happened to you.
It was my mistake, not yours.

12:38.624 --> 12:41.327
I'm the one who had to take the
"Silkwood" shower this morning.

12:41.327 --> 12:44.230
Okay, fine, whatever,
but you'll be cool about this?

12:44.230 --> 12:47.800
You... the one who cool should be!

12:47.800 --> 12:51.070
Oh, all right. Cool.

12:51.070 --> 12:54.406
Ooh... what the hell was that?

12:59.111 --> 13:00.546
First of all, there's an omelet
bar downstairs.

13:00.546 --> 13:03.015
So you should probably go get
yourself an omelet.

13:03.015 --> 13:04.650
Second, I wanted to see

13:04.650 --> 13:05.985
if your room is bigger than mine.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.885
Aw, you have a sitting area?
You jag!

13:08.988 --> 13:09.955
Please come in.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.365
Lemon, I give you a certain
amount of leeway at work.

13:19.365 --> 13:23.769
Uh, but while we're here, I need
you to behave appropriately.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.237
What are you talking about?

13:25.237 --> 13:27.540
Well, the, uh, nicknames, the
arm-punching, the familiarity

13:27.540 --> 13:29.599
the way you were behaving at "LUNCH."

13:30.476 --> 13:33.979
You can't say "uh-doy-ee"
to me in mixed company.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.081
Oh. Okay.

13:36.081 --> 13:38.951
So when I helped you win that Lego thing

13:38.951 --> 13:40.753
when I thought we were having fun together

13:40.753 --> 13:43.322
I was actually embarrassing you?
Is that right, Jack?

13:43.322 --> 13:45.958
Uh, while we're here, I need you
to call me Mr. Donaghy.

13:45.958 --> 13:48.060
I get it.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.862
You brought me here in case you needed me

13:49.862 --> 13:51.764
but now that you have your cool
Six Sigma friends

13:51.764 --> 13:54.900
I can go back to the lake with
the fat kids and make bracelets.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.135
Lemon, you know how important
this is to me.

13:56.135 --> 13:57.303
I've got my speech tonight.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.205
Yeah, don't worry.
I get boundaries.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.639
"Oh, sorry, Liz.

14:00.639 --> 14:03.008
"My parents' basement only has
room for five sleeping bags" or

14:03.008 --> 14:06.378
"No, I'll come over after prom
and we'll make nachos together."

14:06.378 --> 14:07.746
Lemon, this is a part of our problem.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.782
I give you a simple managerial suggestion in

14:09.782 --> 14:12.051
a professional context and
I get back the second half

14:12.051 --> 14:13.319
of a Judy Blume novel.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.054
Whatever. This place is dumb.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.288
We're going to be back at work tomorrow.

14:16.288 --> 14:18.190
Let's not make this bigger than it is.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.092
Too late. Friendship over!

14:20.092 --> 14:22.083
Good Lord.

14:26.498 --> 14:28.295
Like a waitress.

14:34.340 --> 14:38.344
Mr. Jordan, I am begging you
as a friend to eat better.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.679
I just don't want to see
anything bad happen to you.

14:40.679 --> 14:42.248
I'm fine, Ken.

14:42.248 --> 14:45.451
I have so much energy
my hand keeps dancing!

14:45.451 --> 14:49.154
I just don't know what has
to happen for you to start...

14:49.154 --> 14:51.891
Oh, no! The signs!

14:51.891 --> 14:52.958
What?

14:52.958 --> 14:53.959
My desk is sideways!

14:53.959 --> 14:55.294
The Hill Witch approaches.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.261
Ooh!

15:00.799 --> 15:02.534
Dudes, the craziest thing
happened to me last night.

15:02.534 --> 15:05.104
You're not going to believe it

15:05.104 --> 15:07.973
but I found the secret skate
park in Grand Theft Auto Four.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.074
Nice!

15:09.074 --> 15:12.278
Are you seriously talking about video games?

15:12.278 --> 15:14.613
Oh, hey... Jenna.
What's up?

15:14.613 --> 15:15.637
How dare you?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.083
How dare you be cool about this?

15:18.083 --> 15:19.251
Frank and I hooked up last night.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.377
Okay?

15:21.487 --> 15:23.088
Oh, stop acting like you're ashamed.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.256
I'm the one who's ashamed.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.091
I mean, it's disgusting, right?

15:26.091 --> 15:28.260
I slutted it up on this dirt bag.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.728
It is disgusting.

15:29.728 --> 15:31.063
Thank you, Lutz.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.331
Jenna, this is a mistake.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.765
No. Last night was a mistake.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.699
This is a victory for hot women everywhere.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.348
So what are we doing after this?

15:49.348 --> 15:51.817
Um, Prashant and I have plans.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.085
Did you guys hook up?

15:53.085 --> 15:54.987
What happens in Croton-on-Hudson

15:54.987 --> 15:56.386
stays in Croton-on-Hudson.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.624
Uh, Miss Lemon...

15:58.624 --> 16:01.427
I do still have a seat at my table up front.

16:01.427 --> 16:04.530
No, thank you, Mr. Donaghy.
I'm happier here.

16:04.530 --> 16:05.698
Prashant, that is my foot.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.765
My wrongness.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.334
Excuse me, Mr. Donaghy?

16:08.334 --> 16:10.825
I need to put a microphone
on you for your speech.

16:12.104 --> 16:14.006
I need you put
a microphone on you

16:14.006 --> 16:15.441
for your speech.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.110
I can't believe you don't
want to sit with Jack Donaghy.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.846
He's not that great.
You guys are my friends.

16:20.846 --> 16:21.947
We should start

16:21.947 --> 16:23.449
calling ourselves "The Three Musketeers."

16:23.449 --> 16:24.850
Not.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.554
Good one, Prashant.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.889
So I heard about you and Frank.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.925
Ugh, I know, it's hard to believe.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.259
Now, Dog the Bounty Hunter is

16:34.259 --> 16:35.661
the second-grossest guy I've been with.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.663
You shouldn't have done
that with Frank, Jenna.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.797
Tell me about it.

16:38.797 --> 16:40.699
Because he's mine.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.668
Wait, what are you doing?

16:42.668 --> 16:45.604
Ow! Why is my scalp burning more than usual?

16:45.604 --> 16:47.539
I told you not
to tell anyone!

16:47.539 --> 16:49.141
Oh, what are you doing to my hair?

16:49.141 --> 16:50.540
You stay away from my Frank!

16:53.479 --> 16:55.276
Who is with my Frank?

16:56.115 --> 16:59.084
Katie, Euzebia, please, let me explain.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.789
Hmm...

17:03.789 --> 17:05.222
What is this?

17:06.825 --> 17:11.262
Eat your vegetables.

17:11.262 --> 17:13.866
Damn, K. That is weak.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.534
I'm a 40-year-old man.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.203
You think I'ma be scared into
eating some stuff because...

17:18.203 --> 17:19.505
Look at me!

17:19.505 --> 17:21.507
I'm a monster!

17:22.641 --> 17:24.843
The Hill Witch!

17:25.844 --> 17:27.367
Cover your brain!

17:30.449 --> 17:31.473
Eat your vegetables!

17:35.154 --> 17:36.688
Oh, come on, guys.

17:36.688 --> 17:38.991
Okay,
uh, your microphone is all set.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.959
I'll come back right before
your speech to turn it on.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.128
And thanks for being so cool with me.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.130
This is my first day.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.428
No problem.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.443
Well, buddy, here we go.

17:57.443 --> 17:58.644
Bottom of the ninth...

17:58.644 --> 18:00.412
Bases loaded.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.314
Oh, yeah.
It's winning time...

18:02.314 --> 18:03.982
you magnificent son of a bitch!

18:03.982 --> 18:05.017
What is that?

18:05.017 --> 18:06.485
It's his psych-up speech.

18:06.485 --> 18:07.786
He doesn't know his microphone is on.

18:07.786 --> 18:08.821
We've got to tell him!

18:08.821 --> 18:10.089
Why would we?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.853
When a big one falls, four little ones move up.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.394
You go in there and show
those turds who's boss.

18:16.728 --> 18:19.264
Make Mommy
proud of her big boy.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.599
Because he's the best!

18:20.599 --> 18:23.035
Just do it. Is it in you?
I'm loving it!

18:23.035 --> 18:25.537
Just don't say your name, Jack.
Please don't say your name.

18:25.537 --> 18:29.241
- You are Jack
- titan, maverick, lover.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.833
Excuse me, where is the bathroom?

18:35.080 --> 18:37.349
Your mic is on... in the ballroom.

18:37.349 --> 18:38.450
What?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.219
How much did they hear?

18:41.353 --> 18:44.345
Oh, God. I'm ruined.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.359
I'm never gonna live this down.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.394
They're going to talk about this forever.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.230
No, no, no, I'll help you.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.288
It's gonna be okay.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.900
I got nothing.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.973
Whoo! What's up, Six Sigma?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.142
It's Liz Lemon

19:03.142 --> 19:05.144
from the Entertainment Division.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.779
I just fooled y'all with
my Jack Donaghy impression

19:07.779 --> 19:11.750
where I say crazy things that he would never say.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.953
So let's maximize our fun quadrant tonight.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.322
Shout out any other impression
you want to hear

19:17.322 --> 19:18.824
and, uh, I'll do it. I dare you.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.825
Do Jack Donaghy again!

19:19.825 --> 19:21.460
No! What else?

19:21.460 --> 19:23.162
How about Cher?
Al Pacino!

19:23.162 --> 19:24.463
Cher!

19:24.463 --> 19:25.930
I believe I heard "Sling Blade."

19:27.065 --> 19:29.168
Mmm, I love
them French-fried "pataters."

19:29.168 --> 19:30.302
Get off!

19:30.302 --> 19:31.770
What's that? Mrs. Cunningham

19:31.770 --> 19:32.971
from Happy Days?

19:32.971 --> 19:34.273
Oh, Howard.

19:34.273 --> 19:37.265
Oh, Arthur.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.811
What's your name, guy?

19:39.811 --> 19:41.146
Dave.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.347
And what's the craziest thing
that's happened to you

19:42.347 --> 19:44.316
this weekend, Dave?

19:44.316 --> 19:46.818
Hearing Jack Donaghy talk on that microphone.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.324
Well, uh, not anymore 'cause...

19:52.324 --> 19:54.026
check this out.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.196
# Everybody dance now?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.637
Lemon, that was heroic.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.839
And I think it actually worked.

20:07.839 --> 20:09.841
A lot of people from the
conference e-mailed me to ask

20:09.841 --> 20:11.877
if I was there when the bra lady went crazy.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.648
They completely forgot about me.
So... thank you.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.183
Sure.

20:18.183 --> 20:19.785
