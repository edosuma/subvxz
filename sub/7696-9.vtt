WEBVTT

01:33.092 --> 01:34.552
My fellow citizens,

01:34.635 --> 01:37.888
it is with great civic pride
that we gather here today

01:37.972 --> 01:41.142
to break ground
on the new Gotham penitentiary,

01:41.684 --> 01:43.728
which is been funded
by the Wayne Foundation.

01:44.937 --> 01:48.357
As you know,
this project was the dream of one man.

01:48.983 --> 01:51.152
And he's with us here today.

01:51.527 --> 01:54.989
Gotham's new District Attorney,
Harvey Dent.

01:58.034 --> 02:02.038
From this field of weeds and
wild flowers will grow a new institution

02:02.121 --> 02:04.415
to build a better, safer Gotham.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.634
Go! Go! Go!

03:09.438 --> 03:10.898
This is Gordon. What?

03:11.982 --> 03:14.318
We've got a prison break by air.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.112
The chopper's heading this way.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.135
We're home free.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.020
Whoa! What was that?

03:50.104 --> 03:51.188
Just some turbulence.

04:14.962 --> 04:16.297
Thank you, Andre.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.715
I'm starving. Let's eat.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.929
Shouldn't we wait for your friend?

04:24.013 --> 04:27.475
Bruce? Nah. He's always late.
He probably got hung up on business.

04:43.991 --> 04:45.493
What happened?

04:51.165 --> 04:52.583
I hear he's rich.

04:53.042 --> 04:56.003
Yeah, Bruce runs around
with a high-class crowd.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.399
But he still manages to get his kicks.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.989
There's nothing
we don't know about each other.

05:25.407 --> 05:27.618
Who... Who are you?

05:28.118 --> 05:30.037
I'm your worst nightmare.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.875
This is the police! Nobody move!

05:38.963 --> 05:40.589
I think you'll like him.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.424
If he's your friend, I know I will.

05:43.592 --> 05:45.010
Big wings.

05:45.469 --> 05:48.389
Yeah, yeah, big wings.
Move it along, pal.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.310
Alfred, I'm running
a little behind schedule.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.271
<i>I have alerted Mr. Dent, sir.</i>

05:55.354 --> 05:58.858
<i>He and Miss Isley patiently await
your arrival at the Rose Cafe.</i>

05:59.441 --> 06:00.943
How's the food there?

06:01.026 --> 06:03.696
<i>In my humble opinion, sir, exquisite.</i>

06:12.955 --> 06:14.874
I'll be taking the Cord this evening.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.750
As I anticipated, sir.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.712
It is idling out front
with a full tank of gas.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.882
May I recommend
the Trout Amandine?

06:23.257 --> 06:25.009
I'll give it a try, Alfred.

06:25.426 --> 06:26.969
Wise decision, sir.

06:27.052 --> 06:28.137
Bon appetit.

06:32.099 --> 06:33.767
You should've seen Harvey's face.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.607
Oh, look at the time. I have to run.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.233
So soon?

06:41.317 --> 06:44.570
I'm sorry. I have an early meeting
tomorrow. But you stay.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.323
- No.
- I insist.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.491
Spend some time with your crazy friend.

06:50.117 --> 06:53.829
And call me the minute you get home,
Mr. District Attorney.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.719
I'll call you.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.220
Good.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.681
- Nice meeting you, Bruce.
- Same here.

07:12.973 --> 07:15.517
Well, I've been talking to my broker,
and his recommendation was that...

07:15.601 --> 07:16.936
Ooh.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.609
- So what do you think?
- Does she have a sister?

07:24.026 --> 07:26.820
Nope. Pam's one of a kind.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.822
That's why I asked her to marry me.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.283
What?

07:31.367 --> 07:33.702
Yup. That's the Page 1 headline.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.872
Is it getting warm in here?

07:37.164 --> 07:39.708
You're still flushed
from that last kiss.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.294
Harvey, you just met her last week.

07:42.586 --> 07:45.005
And I already know she's the one.

07:45.172 --> 07:46.799
Gosh, it's hot in here.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.343
Marriage is a major step, Harv.

07:49.426 --> 07:52.179
- Don't you think you're rushing it?
- No way.

07:52.388 --> 07:56.183
The moment I laid eyes on Pam,
love hit me right in the face.

08:00.896 --> 08:04.024
Harv, you've lost your mind.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.485
Knock it off.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.570
Harv? Harvey?

08:13.701 --> 08:15.703
Hang on, Harvey. Hang on.

08:30.551 --> 08:31.719
- He's not breathing.
- What's the blood pressure?

08:31.802 --> 08:33.303
Isn't that the District Attorney?

08:34.138 --> 08:35.723
- Get his blood pressure, stat.
- Get the EKG

08:35.806 --> 08:38.225
and move him into OR,
ICU Number 3, stat.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.687
Do we have a pulse?
We need a pulse here.

08:44.356 --> 08:47.776
Get the EKG and move him
into the OR, ICU Number 3, stat.

08:52.781 --> 08:54.450
This is Gordon. What?

08:55.576 --> 08:58.370
Harvey Dent's in a coma
at the medical center. Move out.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.401
So, what's the story, Doctor?
Heart attack?

09:29.735 --> 09:33.113
No, Commissioner.
Mr. Dent has been poisoned.

09:33.697 --> 09:37.785
For criminy sakes.
Bullock, get down to that restaurant.

09:37.993 --> 09:41.205
- What's it called, Wayne?
- Uh, the Rose Cafe.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.666
The Rose Cafe.
And find out who did this.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.085
With pleasure.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.129
I want police guards
on duty here around the clock.

09:49.421 --> 09:50.547
Yes, sir.

09:51.882 --> 09:55.094
Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.

09:58.722 --> 10:00.224
<i>Dr. Kravitz...</i>

10:00.307 --> 10:04.144
Excuse me, Doctor. Are we talking
about food poisoning here?

10:04.228 --> 10:05.270
I doubt it.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.232
This is the most virulent strain
of poison I've ever come across.

10:08.315 --> 10:10.275
We're doing everything we can,
Mr. Wayne.

10:10.692 --> 10:12.194
Is Harvey going to make it?

10:12.277 --> 10:14.238
The poison is racing through his system.

10:14.321 --> 10:18.283
If he's going to make it,
we need to find the antidote, and fast.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.389
So what'd you put in this mousse?

10:40.681 --> 10:43.767
Chocolate, sugar, eggs, cream...

10:44.434 --> 10:45.978
Strychnine?

10:46.061 --> 10:47.813
No, no, no. No strychnine.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.774
But I added just a pinch of vanilla.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.527
You know who did it? Talk!

10:54.111 --> 10:56.321
Hey, I just clean the dishes, okay?

11:01.285 --> 11:03.662
We've isolated the toxin, Alfred.

11:06.039 --> 11:08.041
Indeed we have, sir.

11:08.125 --> 11:13.130
It is a lethal poison derived
from the plant <i>Rosaceae Vularis,</i>

11:13.463 --> 11:16.425
commonly known as the wild thorny rose.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.428
I'll get a plant sample
from the Gotham Botanical Gardens.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.930
We can use it to work up an antidote.

11:22.764 --> 11:25.684
- I'm afraid this is unfeasible.
- Why?

11:25.767 --> 11:30.272
Because, sir, the wild thorny rose
has been extinct for nearly five years.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.984
- Which means, I'm afraid...
- There's no antidote.

11:53.670 --> 11:55.714
Fight, Harvey, fight.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.637
Oh, Bruce, I came
as soon as I got your call.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.181
- How is he?
- We're not sure.

12:05.849 --> 12:08.852
- I want to see him.
- Sorry, ma'am, no visitors.

12:08.977 --> 12:10.604
Commissioner Gordon's orders.

12:15.943 --> 12:20.072
You should try to get some sleep.
Come on, I'll walk you to your car.

12:26.286 --> 12:28.747
Promise to call me
if there's any change?

12:29.122 --> 12:31.458
I will. You get some rest.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.503
Harvey's lucky to have
such a good friend.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.178
- Goodnight, Bruce.
- Goodnight, Pam.

12:55.482 --> 12:56.650
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

12:56.733 --> 12:59.569
Alfred, dig up anything you can
on Pamela Isley.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.698
Who she is, where she's been,
what she does... The works.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.366
<i>Consider it done, sir.</i>

13:11.748 --> 13:12.958
What do you have, Alfred?

13:13.083 --> 13:15.544
Well, sir, Miss Isley
is a research chemist

13:15.794 --> 13:18.380
with Chez Gerard, the cosmetics firm.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.675
She works on the development
of new fragrances.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.262
Their newest
is a perfume called Nightshade.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.306
<i>It's deadly.</i>

13:28.056 --> 13:31.810
Miss Isley has a PhD in botany
from Gotham University,

13:32.185 --> 13:34.730
where she offers
a monthly lecture series

13:34.813 --> 13:37.566
on endangered and extinct plant species.

13:39.526 --> 13:42.112
I think Harvey's engagement is off.

14:31.828 --> 14:35.374
Oh, you've done so well today,
sweetheart.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.292
Now get some rest.

14:37.626 --> 14:41.922
And don't worry, I won't clip off
any more of your beautiful petals

14:42.089 --> 14:43.840
unless I need them.

15:31.054 --> 15:32.222
Huh?

16:00.917 --> 16:04.087
What has my sweet little flytrap
caught this time?

16:17.100 --> 16:19.478
Um, a little big for a fly.

16:32.532 --> 16:34.951
Batman.

16:35.410 --> 16:38.872
A late night rendezvous?
To what do I owe the honor?

16:38.955 --> 16:41.041
Harvey Dent.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.127
Oh, the poor District Attorney.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.880
I hear he's not expected to live.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.549
Oh, it's so sad.

16:55.597 --> 16:56.973
Why, Isley?

16:57.349 --> 17:00.602
Oh, please, call me Poison Ivy.

17:01.853 --> 17:04.856
You see,
Harvey had to pay for his crime.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.691
What crime?

17:07.317 --> 17:09.402
Why, murder, of course.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.322
Plowing up a field
of beautiful wild flowers

17:12.405 --> 17:14.783
for that silly penitentiary of his.

17:15.158 --> 17:19.538
This little rose would be extinct today,
if I hadn't saved my precious

17:19.621 --> 17:21.831
from those horrible bulldozers.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.211
The blood of those flowers
are on his hands.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.384
Uh...

17:32.467 --> 17:33.760
Hmm.

17:34.469 --> 17:36.137
So his fate was sealed...

17:40.725 --> 17:42.227
With a kiss.

17:43.019 --> 17:44.271
<i>And</i> now,

17:44.354 --> 17:46.273
so is yours.

17:58.827 --> 18:02.539
Oh, what's wrong? Afraid I have cooties?

18:04.624 --> 18:05.917
Oh...

18:06.042 --> 18:08.712
Now you've gone and hurt my feelings.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.716
Too bad. I was going to share
the antidote with you.

18:15.218 --> 18:17.429
Lovely fragrance, don't you think?

18:20.599 --> 18:23.059
I call it "Rose From the Dead."

19:01.014 --> 19:02.432
Murderer!

20:16.339 --> 20:17.841
Huh?

20:22.303 --> 20:25.640
Enjoy extinction, Batman.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.851
I'm not going alone.

20:31.312 --> 20:33.982
The bottle for the weed.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.401
What's it going to be?

20:39.612 --> 20:41.406
My baby.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.575
My precious baby!

20:51.791 --> 20:53.668
My pretty baby.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.387
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.765
Why? What happened?

21:07.307 --> 21:10.059
You passed out
into your chocolate mousse.

21:10.185 --> 21:12.020
But you're going to be fine.

21:12.353 --> 21:15.523
Now, Harv, about your engagement
to Pamela Isley...

21:15.940 --> 21:17.734
- We're good friends, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:17.817 --> 21:19.611
I have to be honest with you,
don't I?

21:19.694 --> 21:21.154
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay, then...

21:21.654 --> 21:23.281
I think Pam is wrong for you.

21:23.364 --> 21:24.449
Huh?

21:32.999 --> 21:37.420
They can bury me in the ground
as deep as they like.

21:38.713 --> 21:40.423
But I'll grow back.

21:40.715 --> 21:42.467
We always grow back.

21:43.426 --> 21:44.969
Don't we, baby?

22:17.252 --> 22:18.253
English - SDH
