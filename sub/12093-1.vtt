01:45.272 --> 01:47.821
<i>Someone help us!</i>

01:57.409 --> 01:58.786
Giddap!

02:05.917 --> 02:09.045
- It's the fourth ﬂoor, upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.758
Come on.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.519
No!

02:15.677 --> 02:18.601
Not my daughter! Mercy!

02:23.143 --> 02:25.020
Give us room.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.531
Stay there. Come on.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.243
Not her!

02:58.220 --> 03:00.894
- Break it down.
- Yes, sir.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.603
Baltimore Police!

03:08.814 --> 03:10.908
Give me some light.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.056
Oh, no.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.113
- It's empty.
- That's impossible.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.574
We heard a door lock.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.632
Damn it, the window!

04:20.844 --> 04:22.471
It's nailed shut.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.669
Dear God.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.913
Phylum Chordata...

05:26.076 --> 05:28.704
Subphylum Vertebrata.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.083
With kittens...

05:35.544 --> 05:39.720
The ways of God in nature,
as in providence, are not our ways.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.745
Lovely to see you all again.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.333
Hello, Reagan. Did you miss me?

06:15.500 --> 06:18.049
I'm naturally delighted
to be back in Baltimore,

06:18.211 --> 06:21.215
but in all honesty
I'm feeling <i>a</i> bit under the weather.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.102
However, it has been said that
what brandy cannot cure has no cure.

06:25.260 --> 06:29.140
So what say you to a snifter
for an old, ailing friend?

06:30.265 --> 06:31.767
I'm sorry. What?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.981
Nothing.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.613
I can assume, then,
that you're out of brandy?

06:36.771 --> 06:41.652
- We've got many bottles back there.
- So it's a question of finances.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.743
I don't mean to shock you, Poe,
but we haven't seen you in a while.

06:45.906 --> 06:49.285
Last time you were here,
well, things got rather ugly.

06:49.451 --> 06:53.547
Been back in town only a few days
to find quite shockingly,

06:53.705 --> 07:00.133
I seem to have exhausted
any sort of credit I once had.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.469
Fine, fine. If it's money you want...

07:05.050 --> 07:07.394
Try not to shit yourself.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.099
That's real.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.981
Spot these sailors a round, too,
on me.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.198
Christ, man, now what?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.826
That'll just about
cover the last tab.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.907
Are you really gonna be this cruel?

07:25.070 --> 07:29.541
The "Patriot" is publishing a review
tomorrow. I'll be ﬂush by dawn.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.827
If the paper publishes
anything you write,

07:31.993 --> 07:34.416
you come back tomorrow,
I'll buy you the shot.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.957
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow I might be dead.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.672
Or you might be.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.586
- I'll risk it.
- How's this?

07:45.256 --> 07:47.884
I get a drink for any man here
who recognises me

07:48.051 --> 07:49.473
or one of my poems.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.059
Better get to the door
before I split your head open.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.941
My head is already split open,
you overgrown mouth-breather.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.774
So show me some respect
or I'll give you a personal tour.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.189
I'm an internationally lauded poet.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.483
That's why you've got no money.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.027
- I am Poe.
- That's what I said.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.321
Not poor, mouth-breather! Poe!

08:07.487 --> 08:09.956
Poe! Edgar Allan Poe!
Does it ring a bell?!

08:10.115 --> 08:11.617
No.

08:11.783 --> 08:16.914
A drink to any man in this room
who can finish this line!

08:17.080 --> 08:18.548
"Quoth the Raven..."

08:18.707 --> 08:21.677
- Piss off!
- By IP Daley!

08:24.254 --> 08:26.848
I repeat: "Quoth the Raven"!

08:27.007 --> 08:29.135
- "Nevermore!"
- Hah! Hah!

08:29.300 --> 08:31.598
It is a very favourite poem.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.559
- Vive la France!

08:34.722 --> 08:37.145
Slobs!

08:37.308 --> 08:38.684
Philistines!

08:38.852 --> 08:41.696
You wouldn't recognise
an authentic American literary voice

08:41.855 --> 08:44.608
if it hissed in one ear
and slithered out the other.

08:45.358 --> 08:49.408
We know it hurts to pick
your teeth up with broke fingers.

08:49.571 --> 08:53.121
Is that your imagination's limit,
you mental oyster?

08:53.283 --> 08:56.002
I can conjure a multitude
of more exquisite torments.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.880
Your eyeballs dissolving
in a teaspoon of lye!

08:59.039 --> 09:02.760
Your tongue torn from your throat
with a blacksmith's tongs!

09:02.917 --> 09:07.218
An enema of boiling tar!
A testicle impaled on a kebab skewer!

09:07.380 --> 09:09.678
Get out, you shit!

09:09.841 --> 09:11.935
Slowly. Here.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.022
Put her down.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.808
She's just a girl.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.228
What kind of monster would do this?

09:37.869 --> 09:40.463
Katherine LaForte, 36.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.499
Her daughter Anna, 12.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.132
She was strangled.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.757
She's so young.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.178
He was a large man.

09:54.344 --> 09:58.520
By the extent of his grip, over eight
inches from thumb to forefinger.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.527
You agree someone
locked the door from the inside?

10:06.689 --> 10:09.408
Absolutely. We heard the door lock
as we arrived.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.537
And by the time you broke down
the door, the murderer was gone.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.163
Not a trace.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.667
The window was closed
when you came into the room?

10:17.826 --> 10:20.375
Not just closed, nailed shut.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.936
Tell me, how does such a large man
escape so quickly

10:37.095 --> 10:41.225
from a room in which the door
has been locked from the inside...

10:42.725 --> 10:45.444
and the window nailed shut?

10:45.603 --> 10:50.734
I'm not sure, but the mayor
wants results this time, Inspector.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.446
Question the neighbours.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.491
I want a list of all the men
who visited these premises.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.125
Yes, sir.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.436
A lock... triggered by a spring.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.438
But the nail had...

11:21.472 --> 11:22.849
Cut, mid-shaft.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.940
I checked the window ten times
and never found a spring.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.981
I wouldn't have found it either
except...

11:29.147 --> 11:30.774
What is it?

11:37.655 --> 11:39.999
This crime is familiar to me.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.248
Giddap!

11:49.292 --> 11:50.965
Whoa!

11:51.127 --> 11:53.505
Not again, Mr Poe.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.173
Christ.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.842
Good morning, Percy.

11:57.008 --> 12:00.057
Contrary to precedent, Captain
Hamilton, I've no intention...

12:00.220 --> 12:02.018
..of asking for money.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.898
What do you want, Poe?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.435
I've come back to town
for your daughter.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.615
- Over my dead body.
- Is that an option?

12:11.773 --> 12:13.366
Poe, please.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.744
You know I find you as revolting
as some of your stupid stories.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.496
Some, but not all.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.123
You look lovely today.

12:20.281 --> 12:24.036
Get out, Poe,
before I shoot you where you sit.

12:24.202 --> 12:28.548
And risk splattering blood and brains
over your daughter's fine silk dress?

12:30.708 --> 12:33.006
- Out.
- Is an invitation...

12:33.169 --> 12:35.672
...to the costume ball
out of the question?

12:37.423 --> 12:40.142
- Father, don't.
- Sorry, Charles.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.599
- See you at the track.
- See you, Edgar.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.514
Giddap!

12:50.019 --> 12:51.612
Another abject humiliation.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.155
Please! Mercy!

13:00.321 --> 13:02.870
I have children!

13:04.200 --> 13:06.999
Why are you doing this? Why?!

13:10.623 --> 13:12.466
I'm only a critic!

13:23.678 --> 13:25.521
- Aaaaarghhh!

13:37.734 --> 13:39.702
Good morning. "Baltimore Patriot."

13:39.861 --> 13:41.659
Mr Poe! Your clothes.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.823
Just beating the mudslingers to it.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.867
Fortitude, Ivan, fortitude.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.621
I'm afraid you might need
more than this, Mr Poe.

13:49.787 --> 13:54.668
- Why?
- It's a crime, a terrible crime.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.552
Out with it, man. What is it?

13:56.711 --> 14:00.011
Did that marsupial of an editor
dare to change my review again?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.471
I told him not to touch it.
I told him, Mr Poe.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.557
Where's my review? Where is it?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.393
What has he done?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.728
He said there was no more room
in the layout.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.985
No more room? No more room?

14:12.143 --> 14:16.865
Pray tell, what fine twat
did he deem more worthy?

14:17.023 --> 14:18.491
Longfellow!

14:18.649 --> 14:20.743
Longfellow?!

14:20.902 --> 14:23.075
Longfellow!

14:23.237 --> 14:24.614
Where is it?

14:24.781 --> 14:26.499
- Where is what?
- The trash bin.

14:26.657 --> 14:32.881
That is where all this brain-sucking,
soul-warping fish wrap should be put!

14:33.039 --> 14:34.416
That's lovely, Eddy.

14:34.582 --> 14:38.177
A real show of adjectival fireworks
from the great Poe himself.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.715
Not only do you refuse
to print my review of Longfellow,

14:41.881 --> 14:44.134
but you run
his third-rate poem instead!

14:44.300 --> 14:46.894
- People like Longfellow.
- Editors like you tell them to.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.430
Have you no soul, Henry?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.725
Does the artistic enrichment
of your readers mean nothing to you?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.734
Artistic enrichment?

14:53.893 --> 14:57.363
You've got some gall, barging
into my office and lecturing me

14:57.522 --> 14:59.820
when ail you do
is criticise others' work!

14:59.982 --> 15:01.575
Not true. Not true at all.

15:01.734 --> 15:06.285
You called Emerson
a "sad, festering literary whore".

15:06.447 --> 15:08.040
Because he is precisely that.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.499
Is honesty now a vice, or do you
prefer that jaded hack, Griswold,

15:11.661 --> 15:15.131
fawning over some steaming mound
of hackneyed tripe?

15:15.289 --> 15:18.634
- Doesn't think much of YOUR stuff.
- He's an intellectual nonentity.

15:18.793 --> 15:22.172
He's a buffoon, which is probably why
he's so at home here with you.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.715
Aw, you're out of control.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.102
I'm broke.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.639
Then try writing
another "Tell-Tale Heart".

15:30.805 --> 15:33.183
People love blood. They love death.

15:33.349 --> 15:36.774
If I couldn't churn out a "Tell-Tale
Heart" or a "Pit and the Pendulum“,

15:36.936 --> 15:39.189
I'd indenture
my very soul to the devil.

15:39.355 --> 15:42.029
You've got to publish my review.
I'm desperate.

15:42.191 --> 15:45.070
I need stories. Gripping stories.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.036
I've got nothing left.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.295
I've used up all my tricks.

15:54.454 --> 15:58.004
Try laying off the liquor and
tinctures. It's rotting your brain.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.043
I only drink occasionally,

16:00.209 --> 16:03.133
to be social,
to alleviate my shyness.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.474
And the tinctures
are purely therapeutic.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.057
A slight palliative against the chill
of an orphan's despair.

16:12.138 --> 16:16.314
- Write me something I can sell.
- You're a real bastard, Henry.

16:19.520 --> 16:24.276
Why are you doing this?!
Why?!

16:24.442 --> 16:26.570
What have I done?!

16:27.612 --> 16:29.364
Please!

16:29.530 --> 16:31.453
No!

16:52.803 --> 16:54.305
Aargh!

16:59.602 --> 17:01.980
Agh! Argh!

17:05.023 --> 17:06.992
Aaaargh!

17:16.536 --> 17:18.003
AAARGHH!

17:30.174 --> 17:33.144
Consider, Carl, if you will,
the human heart.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.679
This small chamber,

17:34.845 --> 17:37.018
a vacancy,
where gases are wed to ﬂuids

17:37.181 --> 17:40.105
and all the secrets and mysteries
of our species are hidden.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.746
Write another "Tell-Tale Heart".

18:11.090 --> 18:13.218
You think you're so clever,
don't you?

18:13.384 --> 18:14.931
Miss Hamilton.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.196
"The angels,"

18:27.189 --> 18:28.782
"not half so happy in heaven,"

18:28.941 --> 18:31.490
"Went envying her and me"

18:31.652 --> 18:34.997
"Yes - that was the reason,"

18:35.156 --> 18:38.456
"as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea,"

18:38.618 --> 18:42.748
"That the wind
came out of the clouds by night"

18:42.913 --> 18:46.042
"Chilling and killing
my Annabel Lee."

18:46.208 --> 18:47.585
Continue.

18:49.211 --> 18:54.183
"But our love...
it was stronger by far than the love"

18:54.342 --> 18:57.095
"Of those who were older than we"

18:57.261 --> 19:01.437
"Of many far wiser than we"

19:01.599 --> 19:05.900
"And neither the angels
in heaven above,"

19:06.062 --> 19:11.319
"Nor the demons
down under the sea,"

19:11.484 --> 19:15.534
"Can ever dissever my soul
from the soul"

19:15.696 --> 19:20.748
"Of the beautiful Annabel Lee."

19:23.120 --> 19:25.088
Do you like it?

19:25.247 --> 19:28.968
I think that it is the most romantic
thing I've ever read.

19:37.718 --> 19:42.940
So, I had to hear about your stunt
all afternoon.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.603
I wanted to see if I could get that
vein on the side of his neck

19:46.769 --> 19:49.067
- to finally explode.

19:49.230 --> 19:52.279
I think Father has begun to suspect.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.327
Yes, and I consider it my duty

19:55.486 --> 19:58.330
to wrestle you away
from that gun-toting Philistine.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.662
And into the arms of you,
of all people?

20:00.825 --> 20:03.169
- Who better?
- Then why antagonise him?

20:03.327 --> 20:06.001
I can't help it.
I despise people who despise me.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.632
Edgar, we need to talk.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.089
- What is Carl eating?
- A heart.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.634
- A human heart?
- Mm-hm.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.426
- How in heaven did you come by it?
- An admirer works at the morgue.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.218
I was searching for inspiration.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.309
So tell me again exactly...

20:22.471 --> 20:27.602
how much... money you made

20:27.768 --> 20:31.238
from your self-proclaimed
world-famous poem about that bird?

20:31.397 --> 20:34.241
Raven. $9. But did I mention
that it's world-famous?

20:34.400 --> 20:36.619
Edgar... Edgar.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.654
We can't go on like this.

20:38.821 --> 20:42.917
Emily, what do you want?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.873
I want you to get up off your knees

20:45.035 --> 20:47.959
unless you intend to use
that position for another purpose.

20:48.122 --> 20:51.171
The imagination reels
with possibilities.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.711
But what did you have in mind
specifically?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.755
A proposal.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.720
- You mean marriage?

20:58.883 --> 21:03.229
It's not such a horrible thought.
People still do it from time to time.

21:03.387 --> 21:07.187
- Really? When?
- When they're in love, I suppose.

21:07.349 --> 21:13.447
If I were in love with that person,
would I think about her all the time?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.074
Most likely.

21:15.232 --> 21:19.282
And would I spend
every waking moment

21:19.445 --> 21:21.698
desiring to smother the other
with affection?

21:21.864 --> 21:23.616
It has been described as such.

21:23.783 --> 21:28.254
Emily, you are my greatest
- and only - inspiration.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.460
Emily Hamilton,

21:30.623 --> 21:32.591
will you be my wife?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.297
Yes.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.096
I love you.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.395
You ridiculous man.

21:44.553 --> 21:48.729
Now, what do we do about
your dear, dear, gun-toting father?

21:48.891 --> 21:50.939
I've been thinking about that.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.277
We'll tell him at my birthday ball,

21:55.439 --> 21:57.817
in front of all of Baltimore.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.362
If I were a better man,
I'd forbid it.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.658
But you're not.
- I know.

22:07.910 --> 22:11.005
I found some possibilities
for you, Inspector.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.416
All are gruesome, if you ask me.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.723
"A careful search soon
brought to light the hidden spring."

22:20.881 --> 22:23.384
"I pressed it,
and, satisfied with the discovery,"

22:23.551 --> 22:25.428
"forbore to upraise the sash."

22:26.887 --> 22:28.981
That's it.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.150
Edgar Allan Poe.

22:32.309 --> 22:36.815
Find the Raven, never flitting
still is sitting, still is sitting

22:36.981 --> 22:40.736
On that pallid bust of Pallas
just above my chamber door;

22:40.901 --> 22:45.907
And his eyes have all the seeming
of a demon's that is dreaming,

22:46.073 --> 22:51.421
And the lamp-light o'er him steaming
throws his shadow on the ﬂoor;

22:51.579 --> 22:56.460
My soul from out that shadow
that lies ﬂoating on the ﬂoor

22:56.625 --> 23:00.050
Shall be lifted...

23:00.212 --> 23:02.465
nevermore.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.721
Who's next?

23:12.892 --> 23:16.613
It's called
"The Butterﬂy and the Bee".

23:16.770 --> 23:18.568
An exquisite title, Mrs Bradley.

23:20.274 --> 23:26.031
"The butterﬂy to her brother bee
did sing a song of spring."

23:26.196 --> 23:31.748
'"Come, listen to my ode of thee,
thou honey-making thing..."

23:31.911 --> 23:33.504
Stop, please.

23:35.039 --> 23:38.168
It's terrible. I suspected it was.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.177
"Thou honey-making thing"?

23:40.336 --> 23:44.386
- I attempted to rhyme the lyric.
- You've succeeded.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.848
The juxtaposition
of the beauty of nature

23:48.010 --> 23:51.640
with the whores
of our recently mechanized society,

23:51.805 --> 23:57.027
reducing brother bee to nothing more
than a "honey-making thing",

23:57.186 --> 24:00.235
a meaningless cog
bound for destruction

24:00.397 --> 24:02.491
within the machine of nature.

24:02.650 --> 24:06.075
It's brilliant, Mrs Bradley!
It's terrifying, but it's brilliant.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.534
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

24:08.697 --> 24:12.042
- Someone's here to see you.
- Excellent. Who?

24:14.036 --> 24:15.583
Mr Poe?

24:16.747 --> 24:20.126
Barbarian with a badge.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.343
What's going on?

24:26.840 --> 24:30.640
- Why is hair attracted to a magnet?
- What?

24:30.803 --> 24:34.979
Soot is merely carbon residue
from coal and wood.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.017
Am I under arrest?

24:37.184 --> 24:39.482
I'm Detective Fields.
Please, sit down, Mr Poe.

24:39.645 --> 24:43.070
Yes, the infamous Detective Fields.
Am I under arrest?

24:44.316 --> 24:46.159
No. Not as yet.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.071
Then I'd rather stand.
It makes it easier to leave.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.990
I am...

24:51.156 --> 24:53.375
I'm a reader of your work.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.378
I admit my admirers have gone
to great lengths to meet me.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.539
I didn't say I was an admirer.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.333
And yet you read them.

25:04.044 --> 25:07.014
The night before last a girl
and her mother were found murdered,

25:07.172 --> 25:08.845
the daughter lodged in a chimney,

25:09.008 --> 25:11.887
the mother's head nearly severed
with a straight razor.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.770
The killer ﬂed through a window

25:13.929 --> 25:17.183
in which a lock was feigned
with a nail sawn in half.

25:18.225 --> 25:22.196
Does any of this
sound familiar to you, Mr Poe?

25:23.188 --> 25:25.611
But you're talking about my story.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.697
A work of fiction.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.785
I'm afraid I'm not.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.924
According to various witnesses,
you were seen drunk two nights ago

25:42.082 --> 25:43.880
in a tavern near the harbour.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.588
What time did you leave?

25:50.090 --> 25:52.138
I don't remember.

25:52.301 --> 25:56.727
My leaving was... involuntary.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.519
Do you actually think
that I murdered these people?

26:02.936 --> 26:04.654
May I see your hand?

26:05.647 --> 26:07.194
Which one?

26:07.357 --> 26:09.405
Either will do.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.495
Perhaps with the aid of accomplices

26:15.657 --> 26:18.706
such a scenario
might be conceivable,

26:19.912 --> 26:22.210
however improbable.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.170
Yet what cannot be disputed

26:27.336 --> 26:31.807
is the fact that your imagination
has inspired a horrendous crime.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.842
Am I to be charged, then?

26:34.885 --> 26:37.183
Is imagination now a felony?

26:37.346 --> 26:39.098
- Come!

26:39.264 --> 26:41.813
Inspector, can I have a word?

26:56.573 --> 26:59.247
This is Henry Maddux,
editor of the "Baltimore Patriot".

26:59.409 --> 27:01.958
He was brought in
to identify the body.

27:02.121 --> 27:07.048
His name is... I mean, was...
Gris... Griswold.

27:07.209 --> 27:09.758
- Ludwig Griswold.
- He worked for you?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.639
- Freelance writer.
- What things did he write?

27:12.798 --> 27:15.802
Some poetry. Mostly criticism.
You know, the easy stuff.

27:15.968 --> 27:19.222
Did he have a relationship
with Edgar Allan Poe?

27:19.388 --> 27:22.983
Of course. They hated each other.
Had a vicious feud a year ago.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.894
Sold a lot of papers.

27:25.060 --> 27:29.190
- How long have you known Mr Poe?
- Edgar? Well, the past ten years.

27:29.356 --> 27:32.280
You published his story,
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue".

27:32.442 --> 27:35.195
He wrote that several years back
in Philadelphia.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.239
I reprinted it
a couple of times here.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.625
People love the gory ones.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.168
So they do.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.001
Edgar isn't a suspect,
is he, Inspector?

27:45.164 --> 27:48.008
At this point everyone is a suspect,
Mr Maddux.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.044
Forgive me.

27:51.837 --> 27:56.343
I know there is a darkness
to Edgar, but...

27:56.508 --> 27:58.101
they're all up in here.

27:58.260 --> 28:01.184
Every woman he's ever loved
has died in his arms.

28:01.346 --> 28:07.069
I believe that God gave him a spark
of genius and quenched it in misery.

28:07.227 --> 28:10.777
But as far as something like this...

28:10.939 --> 28:16.412
The only thing he's ever killed
is a bottle of brandy.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.447
Thank you for your time, sir.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.129
This may come
as a shock to you, Mr Poe,

28:26.288 --> 28:30.464
but we are in dire need
of your unwholesome expertise.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.520
I really hadn't imagined
the counterweight to be... so large.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.939
We have reason to believe
you knew the victim.

28:52.105 --> 28:54.199
- Really?
- If you would?

28:59.821 --> 29:01.744
I don't believe I know him.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.080
Then perhaps
this will jar your memory.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.752
"Never has
the perfunctoriness of plot"

29:08.914 --> 29:11.588
"been so mechanized and twisted
by soulless contrivance..."

29:11.750 --> 29:15.254
- Griswold.
- So you do know him.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.797
Yes.

29:16.964 --> 29:20.468
We traded barbs, as in words
not actual weapons of any sort

29:20.634 --> 29:23.103
as writers do to sell
a few newspapers.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.981
"The Pit and the Pendulum",
when was it published?

29:26.139 --> 29:29.063
'42. "Tales of Ratiocination."

29:29.226 --> 29:32.355
Are there other stories
in the collection?

29:32.521 --> 29:35.320
- Many.
- Specifically about murder?

29:35.482 --> 29:36.950
I'm afraid so.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.111
As unfortunate as this is,

29:39.278 --> 29:43.249
you may be uniquely qualified
to cast light on our killer.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.580
There is logic
underlying these deaths.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.086
Do you think this comes
from a logical mind?

29:48.245 --> 29:50.418
A man who carves
a human being in half

29:50.580 --> 29:52.674
doesn't come from a place of logic.

29:52.833 --> 29:57.680
- Then from where?
- Mental disease. Obsession.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.431
Passion.

30:00.382 --> 30:03.556
I believe the killer is taunting us.

30:03.719 --> 30:06.347
He wants us to know
he's gonna strike again.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.564
What do you make of this?

30:11.727 --> 30:16.574
- It was covering the victim's face.
- "The Masque of the Red Death."

30:20.527 --> 30:22.120
What is it?

30:23.780 --> 30:27.375
The quote from the story mentions
Prospero, a character I created

30:27.534 --> 30:31.380
to symbolise man's arrogance even
when confronted with certain death.

30:31.538 --> 30:36.135
Prospero hosts a costume ball
where Death comes in disguise.

30:36.293 --> 30:39.923
Charles Hamilton is hosting
a ball tomorrow night at the museum.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.552
<i>"And one by one
dropped the revellers"</i>

30:44.718 --> 30:47.141
<i>"in the blood-bedewed halls
of their revel, "</i>

30:47.304 --> 30:51.309
If "The Masque of the Red Death"
is his next intended story,

30:51.475 --> 30:55.150
we must use this opportunity
to capture this man at your ball.

30:55.312 --> 30:58.441
Too harsh. I want something older.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.200
"And Darkness and Decay..."

31:00.359 --> 31:03.283
Six cases should be enough.

31:03.445 --> 31:06.790
"And Darkness and Decay
and the Red Death"

31:06.948 --> 31:09.292
"held illimitable dominion over all."

31:14.706 --> 31:18.336
So this gentleman dresses up
like a... what? Like a...

31:18.502 --> 31:22.097
The figure was shrouded “head to foot
in the habiliments of the grave“.

31:22.255 --> 31:25.179
Like a corpse, or a skeleton?

31:25.342 --> 31:28.892
Then, at the stroke of midnight,
he comes in and kills everybody?

31:31.264 --> 31:34.484
Poe is a damn viper.
I ordered him away from Emily.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.737
- Now he's trying to...
- Sir...

31:36.895 --> 31:39.694
The similarities
are too coincidental.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.109
I'm asking you again.

31:42.275 --> 31:46.530
Allow me to have my men scattered
about your ball, in costume,

31:46.696 --> 31:48.869
so we can hopefully
catch this monster.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.998
I'll hire extra security myself,

31:52.160 --> 31:55.664
but I will not have this turned into
<i>a</i> policeman's ball.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.424
Understood?

31:57.582 --> 32:00.711
I've seen the effects
of this man's determination.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.800
If he has chosen your gathering to...

32:02.963 --> 32:06.684
You will not destroy an evening
Baltimore looks forward to each year.

32:06.842 --> 32:09.186
Then I insist my officers be present.

32:09.344 --> 32:13.770
Fine. Just make sure
they scrape the shit off their boots.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.980
Who was Prospero?

32:22.524 --> 32:25.323
He was the host of the ball.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.738
And the first to die.

32:31.992 --> 32:35.542
CHOPIN'S "NOCTURNE")

32:46.756 --> 32:50.556
She's so wonderfully full of life.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.121
- I've been reading...
- What's he doing here?

33:14.284 --> 33:16.378
- He's with me. We were just leaving.
- Captain.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.959
Just proving how easy it is
to penetrate the breach.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.341
I presume the police are here
to keep me out.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.800
Mr Fields, if Mr Poe
is a part of your investigation...

33:24.961 --> 33:28.386
Mr Poe has a unique perspective
on aspects of this crime.

33:28.548 --> 33:32.178
Why? Is the killer an alcoholic,
an opium addict and atheist?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.472
An atheist?
You misconstrue me, sir.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.107
Poe, you stay away from my daughter.

33:37.265 --> 33:40.769
Father, I've decided to change
my costume for the ball tomorrow.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.313
No.

33:42.479 --> 33:45.653
Mr Fields, I'm happy to indulge
your request for security,

33:45.815 --> 33:49.786
but if I see him tomorrow night,
you'll have to protect him from me.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.572
Why do we need security?

33:51.738 --> 33:55.117
My writing has become
the inspiration to an actual killer.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.660
Quite gruesome, really.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.545
If I'd known my work had
a morbid effect on people,

33:59.704 --> 34:01.502
I'd have devoted more time
to eroticism.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.133
You're a vile little man.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.089
As I said, we were just leaving.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.801
- Yes.
- Percy, show this man to the door.

34:09.755 --> 34:12.225
Mrs Bradley, could you join me
in the other room?

34:12.384 --> 34:14.478
What is going on?

34:14.636 --> 34:16.228
Emily.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.436
We should reconsider
our announcement.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.817
- Why? Are you backing out?
- No, never.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.728
If your father sees me there,
he may have me shot.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.444
And a depraved killer
may be on the guest list.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.234
It's a bit much for one night,
don't you think?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.495
I think it sounds thrilling.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.246
Does it? Why?

34:33.405 --> 34:38.411
How else should Edgar Allan Poe
commit himself to eternal love

34:38.577 --> 34:41.376
other than under threat of death?

34:58.888 --> 35:03.109
The Grim Reaper. A ghost.
The Headless Horseman, if you like.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.191
He should be easy to spot.

35:05.353 --> 35:08.152
Elderidge, take some of these men
and patrol the back.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.192
Sir.

35:18.658 --> 35:22.754
You must be selling a lot of
newspapers. Two murders in a week.

35:22.912 --> 35:27.213
Circulation has indeed improved,
despite unfortunate events.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.137
Time for a piss.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.690
- May I have this dance?
- Father.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.824
Not now.

35:53.443 --> 35:57.823
I'm not sure what's troubling you,
but your future happiness

35:57.989 --> 36:00.583
means more to me
than I could possibly describe.

36:00.742 --> 36:05.248
I really hope you feel that way
at the end of the evening.

36:05.413 --> 36:08.417
Whatever this is about,
I need you to be more social.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.132
It is an important gathering
for me and for us.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.968
Father, I know what's expected.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.978
Excuse me! Please.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.776
Please, step aside.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.980
Step aside!

37:48.516 --> 37:50.939
Fields' men aren't causing
any trouble?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.570
No, sir.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.824
What of Poe? Any sign of him?

37:56.983 --> 37:58.576
Not so far.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.581
A glass of wine, sir?

38:22.759 --> 38:25.012
You look just stunning, my dear.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.526
Nevermore.

38:35.063 --> 38:39.660
"..Can ever dissever my soul
from the soul"

38:39.818 --> 38:42.697
"Of the..."
I'm sorry, I'm waiting for someone.

38:42.862 --> 38:46.992
"Of the beautiful Annabel... Lee."

39:28.199 --> 39:30.873
You dance passionately, sir.

39:31.035 --> 39:34.084
If I could, I would dance with you
throughout time.

39:34.247 --> 39:37.251
- I love you, Edgar.
- And I you.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.258
- You really are a reckless girl...

39:41.421 --> 39:44.220
...to dance with a stranger
with a mask,

39:44.382 --> 39:46.760
with a murderer in our midst.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.936
- Speaking of which...

39:52.098 --> 39:54.192
- Courage, Edgar.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.900
- It's happening! This way.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.611
Oh, Edgar!

40:04.777 --> 40:06.154
Emily!

40:14.537 --> 40:15.914
Agh!

40:16.080 --> 40:18.208
He told me you'd ordered it
for the party.

40:18.374 --> 40:21.844
- Who? Who ordered it?
- I'm supposed to deliver this.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.303
My daughter. He has her.

40:26.466 --> 40:28.889
- Percy! Seal off this building!
- Find her!

40:29.052 --> 40:31.771
- Come on!

40:40.188 --> 40:43.283
"I challenge the brilliant
detective mind of Edgar Allan Poe."

40:43.441 --> 40:46.365
"A game of wits
with Emily's life in the balance."

40:46.527 --> 40:49.656
"You will immortalise for the
exquisite pleasure of your readers"

40:49.822 --> 40:53.918
“this, your very own
'Descent into the Maelstrom',"

40:54.077 --> 40:58.048
"which shall appear in serial form
in the 'Baltimore Patriot'."

40:58.206 --> 41:00.629
"Know that I will kill again,
and on that new corpse"

41:00.792 --> 41:04.137
"I will leave you clues
that will lead to Emily."

41:04.295 --> 41:06.844
"If I do not read a vivid
accounting of this convergence"

41:07.006 --> 41:10.852
"of fact and fiction,
then dear Emily will die."

41:11.010 --> 41:14.105
"Your only hope
is to imagine a way to save her."

41:14.263 --> 41:16.982
"I dare you to try to conceive
of the painstaking care"

41:17.141 --> 41:18.893
"I have taken to secure her"

41:19.060 --> 41:23.031
"and the elegant means
leading inexorably to her end."

41:23.189 --> 41:26.489
"Are you up to the task, Mr Poe?"

41:26.651 --> 41:28.528
"Are you even capable of imagining"

41:28.695 --> 41:31.073
"the means to save
your beloved's life?"

41:31.239 --> 41:34.960
"Or shall this tale end
as all your stories do,"

41:35.118 --> 41:39.715
"with Madness, Sin and Horror
the soul of the plot?"

41:41.082 --> 41:43.380
Your men are right. I've killed her.

41:43.543 --> 41:46.012
We must assume
Miss Hamilton is still alive.

41:46.170 --> 41:50.425
Why must we assume that? Because
it's more convenient to do so?

41:50.591 --> 41:52.969
Why am I to blame?

41:53.136 --> 41:55.639
Where were all these officers
last night?!

41:55.805 --> 41:57.978
Where were you?!

41:58.141 --> 41:59.768
He told you he was coming!

41:59.934 --> 42:01.686
Mr Poe, listen to me.

42:02.228 --> 42:03.946
This killer is methodical.

42:04.105 --> 42:06.699
He will keep her alive
to keep you involved.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.987
It's part of his game and that's
the logic that will trap him.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.906
It's the facts of this case
that give us the advantage.

42:13.072 --> 42:16.872
Did you tell your people to
familiarise themselves with my face?

42:17.035 --> 42:20.039
They'll see it every hour
till my daughter is returned to me.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.581
Mr Hamilton, I'm very sorry.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.627
As well you should be!
She was taken under your watch.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.921
- Sir, if you would please...
- What the hell is HE doing here?

42:29.297 --> 42:31.299
- Bastard!
- Hey!

42:33.468 --> 42:36.688
Arrest him. It's his fault.

42:36.846 --> 42:39.895
There is plenty of fault
to be passed around.

42:40.058 --> 42:43.528
I'm sure you understand
what I mean by that, Mr Hamilton.

42:43.686 --> 42:48.943
Mr Poe here is our only connection
to the man who has your daughter.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.156
I suggest you remember that.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.997
Out of the way.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.002
We will reconvene in two hours.

43:08.169 --> 43:11.298
Until then, I want every street
in Baltimore manned. Understood?

43:11.464 --> 43:13.137
Yes, sir.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.933
Lord help my poor soul.

43:32.401 --> 43:33.823
Oh. Oh, Lord.

43:39.700 --> 43:42.670
Wait. No. No...

43:42.829 --> 43:46.709
Wait... Please...

43:46.874 --> 43:49.502
- Help! Let me out!

43:49.669 --> 43:51.046
Let me out of here!

43:51.212 --> 43:55.558
- No, stop! Stop!

43:59.846 --> 44:02.190
Shut it, Emily,

44:02.348 --> 44:05.227
or I'll shut it for you.

44:07.395 --> 44:08.863
OK.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.529
OK. I'm sorry.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.825
- Sorry.

44:31.210 --> 44:34.089
The human body is to be revered.

44:34.255 --> 44:37.099
We must at all times be respectful

44:37.258 --> 44:43.436
and remember that a cadaver
is more than a mere learning tool.

44:43.598 --> 44:45.600
We shall examine the lungs.

44:45.766 --> 44:49.316
This man is an alleged victim
of consumption.

44:53.441 --> 44:56.240
Professor? What is it?

44:58.321 --> 44:59.994
Dear God.

45:21.302 --> 45:24.556
She could be a prostitute,
the way she's painted up.

45:27.266 --> 45:28.859
Did you open this?

45:30.311 --> 45:32.814
Were your hands clean?

45:32.980 --> 45:36.951
Yes. I don't believe
I left that smudge, Inspector.

45:38.069 --> 45:41.243
She must have fought him
or scratched him.

45:41.405 --> 45:43.078
She didn't fight him.

45:44.575 --> 45:48.421
There are no wounds on her wrists.
It can't be her blood, Inspector.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.752
He came at her from behind.

45:51.958 --> 45:54.052
Strangled.

45:56.045 --> 45:58.594
Another of your stories?

45:58.756 --> 46:03.057
Mr Poe, I asked
is this another of your stories?

46:04.303 --> 46:06.726
"The Mystery of Marie Roget."

46:10.559 --> 46:12.482
It's a sailing knot.

46:12.645 --> 46:15.364
It's a bowline knot, to be exact.

46:15.523 --> 46:17.116
Just as it was in the story.

46:17.275 --> 46:20.154
All right. Then what of it?

46:20.319 --> 46:22.196
Who was she?

46:22.363 --> 46:26.618
She was a girl...
who worked in the stores in Paris

46:26.784 --> 46:29.207
near the Quais.

46:29.370 --> 46:33.420
She drowned. There was no mention
of blood on her hands.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.835
He added that detail.

46:38.462 --> 46:41.261
You must write it now. Every detail.

46:41.424 --> 46:44.803
The knot, her dress, her hands.

46:46.595 --> 46:49.314
Her eyes. Her end.

46:54.854 --> 46:57.733
<i>Her smile portended nothing.</i>

46:57.898 --> 47:02.529
<i>Her innocence was the first part
of her soul to die.</i>

47:02.695 --> 47:07.201
<i>And while it happened,
he stood still,</i>

47:07.366 --> 47:11.496
<i>watching to fully enjoy
the dreadful metamorphosis</i>

47:11.662 --> 47:14.632
<i>from a life full of hope</i>

47:14.790 --> 47:16.884
<i>to death without purpose.</i>

47:27.303 --> 47:28.771
Mr Poe.

47:29.972 --> 47:32.816
I've been, erm...

47:32.975 --> 47:36.149
I'm sorry to disturb you but...

47:36.312 --> 47:38.406
I was a little concerned
about your...

47:38.564 --> 47:40.942
- My progress?
- Yes.

47:41.984 --> 47:46.990
I feel as if I've gone from author
to character in one of my tales.

47:47.156 --> 47:50.877
As trapped and bedevilled as any of
the hapless bastards I ever created.

47:51.952 --> 47:53.499
I can appreciate that.

48:02.296 --> 48:05.846
Regardless of what
you think of me, Fields,

48:06.008 --> 48:08.852
I am a master of my art,

48:09.011 --> 48:11.355
and I will not fail her.

48:12.515 --> 48:14.984
I know that.

48:19.271 --> 48:23.071
Look, I... I think I was overly harsh
with you the other day,

48:23.234 --> 48:26.579
and for that I'd like to apologise.

48:35.830 --> 48:39.710
My wife was singing at the piano
when she first coughed up blood.

48:40.960 --> 48:46.683
I prepared myself for the worst,
but Virginia seemed to recover,

48:46.841 --> 48:48.935
and foolishly I succumbed to hope.

48:52.638 --> 48:56.233
But by year's end
the blood came again...

48:56.392 --> 48:57.769
and again.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.404
Great effusions of blood.

49:00.563 --> 49:06.161
Raging fevers, her sheets spattered
with crimson, drenched with sweat.

49:06.318 --> 49:08.662
I often thought I could hear
the sound of darkness

49:08.821 --> 49:12.200
as it stole across the horizon
rushing towards me.

49:12.908 --> 49:14.581
But here I...

49:16.412 --> 49:21.293
I was overwhelmed
by <i>a</i> sorrow so poignant,

49:21.459 --> 49:26.465
when she finally died I felt
in all candour a great release.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.678
But it was supplanted by the return

49:28.841 --> 49:33.267
of that dark and morbid melancholy
that followed me like a black dog...

49:35.556 --> 49:37.229
all my life...

49:40.102 --> 49:41.945
until I met Emily.

49:47.401 --> 49:49.950
Time is running out, Inspector.

49:50.112 --> 49:53.662
Do you really believe
she's still alive?

49:55.910 --> 49:57.787
I'm sure of it.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.839
Magnificent.

50:50.005 --> 50:51.632
Poe, you have done it again.

50:51.799 --> 50:55.474
The invention is... breath-taking.

50:55.636 --> 51:00.517
The line of truth and fiction
has never been so...

51:00.683 --> 51:02.435
So...

51:02.601 --> 51:04.603
I'm not sure about your headline.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.898
Henry, you will not change one word.

51:07.064 --> 51:09.158
Fine. Ivan? Ivan...

51:11.485 --> 51:13.328
Reset page one immediately.

51:20.578 --> 51:25.425
<i>..melancholy that's followed me
like a black dog all my life...</i>

51:25.583 --> 51:27.506
<i>I love you, Edgar.</i>

51:34.300 --> 51:36.394
Fields!

51:36.552 --> 51:39.351
- The blood, Poe, it's fake!
- The blood?

51:39.513 --> 51:43.609
The prostitute. She's no prostitute.
It's stage blood. She's an actress.

51:43.767 --> 51:46.270
- The blood on the hands. "Macbeth."
- Exactly.

51:49.565 --> 51:53.115
Poe's like the hangman, the bastard,
making money off the dead.

51:53.277 --> 51:56.952
Get your paper!
About a serial killer on the loose!

51:57.114 --> 52:00.038
Cantrell is at the theatre.
All the exits are secured.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.953
The Imperial, I'm assuming.
My mother's playhouse.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.997
The victim was still in her costume,

52:05.164 --> 52:08.384
which suggests she was abducted
directly from the theatre.

52:14.131 --> 52:15.678
We'll find her.

52:17.176 --> 52:20.806
I would gladly give my life for hers,
Mr Fields.

52:22.806 --> 52:25.025
I know you would.

52:39.114 --> 52:41.412
Out, damned spot. Out, I say!

52:41.575 --> 52:43.919
One, two...

52:46.789 --> 52:49.212
...then, 'tis time to do it!

52:51.543 --> 52:53.386
Hell is murky!

52:54.880 --> 52:56.257
Who are you?

52:56.423 --> 52:59.017
Police. I have a warrant
to search these premises.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.644
What for? There's a show on!

53:00.803 --> 53:03.682
- Bring all stagehands now.
- They have to man the ropes.

53:03.847 --> 53:07.021
First Lady Macbeth takes a powder,
and now you bastards...

53:08.310 --> 53:09.778
Ten seconds.

53:15.984 --> 53:18.487
Put out your hands.

53:22.700 --> 53:26.170
Ladies and gentlemen,
the play will resume shortly.

53:26.328 --> 53:27.955
Please take your seats.

53:29.581 --> 53:31.925
You, step forth.
Take off the gloves.

53:32.084 --> 53:34.928
- Is this your entire crew?
- Yes.

53:35.087 --> 53:36.885
- Are you sure?
- I am.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.846
- Count them again.

53:40.008 --> 53:42.010
What are you doin?!

53:42.177 --> 53:44.521
We've got seven minutes
before the act change.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.774
- You, where are you from?
- Liverpool.

53:46.932 --> 53:49.811
Got three days' shore leave
to make extra scratch.

53:49.977 --> 53:52.400
- So if you don't mind, please...
- Read it.

53:55.107 --> 53:57.576
It's "Macbeth". I know the play.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.908
- Someone's missing.
- Who?

54:00.070 --> 54:01.538
- Maurice.
- Where is he?

54:01.697 --> 54:05.122
I don't know, but nobody's allowed
to leave until the show is over.

54:05.284 --> 54:06.957
He's here.

54:07.119 --> 54:09.417
If any of them try to leave,
shoot them.

54:09.580 --> 54:11.253
Yes, sir.

54:36.982 --> 54:38.950
...put on your nightgown...

55:11.016 --> 55:13.940
You there, come out. Show yourself.

55:24.446 --> 55:25.914
Stop!

55:26.615 --> 55:28.083
Show yourself!

55:29.076 --> 55:30.453
I will kill you!

55:35.707 --> 55:37.380
I have a pistol aimed on you.

55:37.543 --> 55:40.888
Come out now. Put your hands
where I can see them or I will fire.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.356
Don't shoot me!
I'm in the play!

56:00.232 --> 56:03.156
You're all right.
You stay here, OK?

56:08.615 --> 56:10.788
- What happened?
- My pistol, I lost it.

56:10.951 --> 56:12.544
- I saw him.
- Damn it.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.797
- Seal the doors! He's here!
- Yes, sir!

56:14.955 --> 56:17.049
The missing stagehand,
what was his name?

56:17.207 --> 56:18.584
Maurice.

56:18.750 --> 56:20.673
Hey! Where do the crew
keep their things?

56:20.836 --> 56:22.304
We have lockers downstairs.

56:34.099 --> 56:36.193
Here. Poe!

56:38.812 --> 56:40.780
Fields, up here.

56:56.538 --> 56:58.336
What is that?

56:58.498 --> 57:00.592
Looks like a piece of fish.

57:01.710 --> 57:03.383
That is a human tongue.

57:05.589 --> 57:07.466
What does it mean?

57:09.301 --> 57:13.056
Wait. Yes. "The Facts
in the Case of M Valdemar."

57:13.221 --> 57:15.895
A man's suspended
between life and death by mesmerism.

57:16.058 --> 57:19.733
A living corpse who can only speak
via the vibrations of his tongue.

57:19.895 --> 57:21.272
It's a bit of burlesque.

57:21.438 --> 57:22.815
But the tongue wasn't severed.

57:22.981 --> 57:26.451
Mr Poe! Sir,
there's been an accident.

57:27.277 --> 57:28.745
Put your backs into it!

57:31.239 --> 57:33.708
Come on! Keep it going!
We're gonna need more!

57:33.867 --> 57:36.495
The fire's not going
to put itself out! Come on!

57:36.662 --> 57:39.381
Jack, get all those people
back from the building!

57:39.539 --> 57:42.964
Please, step back! Move back!
It's not safe. Get back, sir.

57:43.126 --> 57:45.345
Everybody, get back!

57:47.798 --> 57:49.675
A damnation on earth.

57:49.841 --> 57:56.099
Hell's brimstone his food,
consumed from birth, in solitude.

57:57.516 --> 58:00.235
Let's go, men! Move it, move it!

58:03.730 --> 58:08.406
The windows were shattered first.
I don't think it was an accident.

58:10.654 --> 58:12.031
I'm certain you're correct.

58:12.197 --> 58:14.916
- Sir, we also found this.

58:15.075 --> 58:19.080
I'll take it if it's not yours.
He's stuck with us since we got here.

58:19.246 --> 58:22.170
I can tell from the sound
of his voice he's mine.

58:23.667 --> 58:25.965
Thank you, Officer.

59:47.542 --> 59:50.045
Why are you doing this to me?

59:54.674 --> 59:56.972
Please let me out.

59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.389
I can't.

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.980
Yes, you can.

01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:06.486
You can.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:09.615
Please.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.241
I'm so cold.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.663
Why are you doing it?

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:34.135
Please don't let me die in here.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:39.556
Miss Hamilton...

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:15.801
No! No! No!

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:01.051
Mr Poe.

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:04.812
I'm afraid I found myself
without lodgings.

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.190
Yes, I heard.

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:09.477
I don't mean to impose.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:13.193
Oh, yes, of course.
Forgive me, please. Come in.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:18.027
It appears to Baltimore I've become
one of the very demons I conceived.

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:21.072
- The fire was intentional.
- Yes, I heard.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.536
The town is angry.
The mayor wants results.

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:26.542
Another set of unsolved murders?
Is that it?

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:39.222
He was inches away.
If I hadn't dropped my weapon...

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:42.517
Perhaps.

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:45.350
But we have made some headway.

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:50.609
According to theatre records, the
sailor's name is Maurice Robichaux.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.815
Does that mean anything to you?

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:55.072
No.

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.983
Cantrell and I made some inquiries
at the docks.

01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:01.619
He was signed on to a trading vessel
which made port five days ago.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.200
The start of the murders.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:06.082
And, like many sailors,
he took employment in the theatre,

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.335
working the backstage riggings.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.962
But, as we know,
he wasn't there today.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.715
Everything down to our entrance
was prearranged.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.717
Look, it may be arduous,

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:20.722
but I've learned, in order
to find a needle in a haystack,

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.723
you have to go through the hay.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:26.386
- These ship's records I think...
- Ship's records?

01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:29.932
I must remind you, Mr Poe,
every detail here is essential.

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:36.105
Tell me, are you not piqued
by your abject failure

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:38.148
to ferret out this assassin?

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:41.489
Your reputation is at stake.
Look at me.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.494
Four people are dead!

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.455
An angel breaks on the rack
of some depraved beast,

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:54.339
but this clerk squints over his
eyeshades at ledgers and timetables!

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.465
Is this a fucking joke?!

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:58.092
What else should we do?!

01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:01.676
Run around all of Baltimore
screaming out her name?!

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.625
Now, please, think.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.250
Start with the sailor.

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:36.915
Have you ever written
anything about a sailor?

01:04:37.082 --> 01:04:38.459
No.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.883
Did you speak with the ship captain?

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.973
- I did.
- And?

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:52.765
Robichaux was a valued crewman.
Well liked.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.774
Had a family back home.

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:57.903
- Where?
- In France.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:00.155
Nimes.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.190
- Anything?
- No.

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:04.906
Yes. Possibly. Who knows?

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:11.826
You see, what I keep asking myself
is... why Baltimore?

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:15.662
The Fortunato had docked
in ports around the world.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:17.672
- The what?
- All over the world.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:20.710
- The name of the ship, say it again.
- Fortunato.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:26.469
"The thousand injuries of Fortunato
I had borne as I best could."

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.008
What is that?

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.927
The first sentence of
"The Cask of Amontillado".

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.813
- Go on.
- A story I wrote about revenge.

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:37.977
A man kills his rival by walling him
up. Fortunato is entombed alive.

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:40.441
- Where?
- In the catacombs of a palazzo.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:43.823
- The story is set in Italy.
- There are no catacombs here.

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:47.657
No, but there are tunnels
underneath the city.

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:49.905
Tunnels?

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:51.698
The waterworks.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:57.629
You are looking for anything that
would indicate recently laid masonry.

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.164
We will be timing this.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:02.925
I will blow my whistle as such...

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:06.429
We will then shout her name in unison
from all areas of the tunnels.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.682
Emily!

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:13.474
There'll be a pause
often seconds of absolute silence

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.934
when we will listen
for the smallest sound.

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.941
Anything to indicate movement
from behind the walls.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.944
If an officer detects something,
he will blow his whistle

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.481
and we will examine the wall
at that point.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:26.741
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.777
Then move out.

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:01.560
Emily!

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:04.479
Emily!

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.402
Emily!

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:09.738
- Shh!

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:37.053
Emily!

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:45.149
- Emily!

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.154
EMILY!

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:56.623
Over here.
They're down here.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:59.625
The mortar's a different colour.
Look.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:04.797
Hold that.

01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:08.051
Here. Stand back.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.389
What is it? Do you have hen?

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:24.434
- Give me that.
- What is it, Inspector?

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:30.240
- Keep digging.
- Yes, sir.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.500
Halt!

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:42.429
Aaarghhh!

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:55.200
- Get the doctor.

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:09.168
"Do not bemoan the sailor's life."

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:12.049
"He was always sure to die anyway."

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:16.054
"But his demise did serve a purpose
of leaving you clues."

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.510
"Godspeed, Poe.
Emily weakens by the hour,"

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:20.641
"both physically and spiritually."

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.056
I will kill him.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:27.895
No matter how this ends,
I will kill this perversion of a man.

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:31.277
"Godspeed"?
Even his prose is barbaric.

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:33.154
Why dress him up like Miss Hamilton?

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:35.610
For the thrill of watching me suffer.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.328
Here, John. Bring the light closer.

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:43.285
I think I've found something.

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:47.414
What is that?

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.204
Help me turn him over.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:58.384
I think we've found
our missing sailor.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:04.143
It's a sextant.

01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:06.771
Natural choice for a seaman,
I suppose.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.897
My brother, he went to sea.

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:11.559
A lot of men,
they get these in the Orient.

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:16.482
This notch in the ﬂesh is fresh.
It's still clotted.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.615
The killer did this.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.369
Think it was part of the struggle?

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:24.576
- Too deliberate.
- It's a latitudinal co-ordinate.

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:27.162
If you mark the angle of the sun
at its highest point

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:29.293
it shows you how far you are
from the equator.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.329
It's useless without longitude.

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:36.293
Even in the army
they teach basic navigation.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.177
I went to West Point.

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:40.054
I was expelled, don't worry.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:41.806
Fields, look there.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.928
Get me a scalpel.

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:50.807
Here.

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:11.661
His tongue has been removed.

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.044
And this...

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:16.674
has replaced it.

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:19.176
What's it for?

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.053
Longitude.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:23.180
Pen and paper.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.341
He's giving us a location.

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:32.941
- Open up! Open the door!

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:34.567
Where's Hamilton?

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:36.648
- Hamilton!
- What's happened?

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:39.690
We need your navigational maps
and celestial almanacs.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.780
- Why?
- He gave us the location of Emily.

01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:47.246
This watch is mine.

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:49.533
I thought I'd lost it.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:51.497
- The kilter left this?
- On the dead sailor.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:54.082
- In, to be more exact.
- The utter gall.

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:56.418
Along with
the latitudinal co-ordinates.

01:12:58.457 --> 01:12:59.834
Incredible.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:04.097
Forgive me. I have no background
in navigational techniques.

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:06.724
To plot an exact position,
you need three things:

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:10.478
a sextant, an accurate chronometer
and a celestial almanac.

01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:16.689
The almanac tells the exact time
at which the sun hits its zenith.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:18.444
- Exact noon.
- Shall I bring more?

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:20.901
Leave it! Please.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.407
It's all right, Percy. Get another.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:28.788
If your watch is set to Greenwich
Mean Time, you can calculate

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:31.290
how far east or west
of Greenwich, London you are.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:35.170
Twelve... twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight, rather.

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.626
- Which one, damn it?
- Twenty-eight.

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:39.631
- Twelve twenty-eight, right?
- Yes.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:43.385
Longitude is a measure of time
east or west.

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:47.469
Latitude, distance from the equator.
That's north or south.

01:13:47.632 --> 01:13:49.350
Seventeen degrees north.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:54.267
The West Indies? It can't be.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:58.025
He couldn't have
transported her that far.

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.357
Here. St Croix.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:05.195
That's impossible. The Danish
West Indies is <i>a</i> two-week journey.

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:08.077
It's not an island, St Croix.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:10.488
Holy Cross.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:12.032
Holy Cross!

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:14.576
Holy Cross Church.
That's our parish.

01:14:20.247 --> 01:14:21.794
Giddap!

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:39.935
Cantrell, you and the others
around back.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:42.945
Spread out. If need be, break
a window. We must get inside!

01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:45.607
- Emily!
- Come on!

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:04.793
Emily!

01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:25.939
North-west corner!

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.580
John!

01:15:38.409 --> 01:15:40.832
- Don't move, John.

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:43.214
- Argh!

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.919
He's over here!

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:48.969
There! Black horse!

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.016
Steady.

01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:58.812
- Fields?
- Get him!

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:01.770
Find him, Edgar! Go!

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.519
- Your name!

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:26.855
You coward!

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:36.819
Who are you?!

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.833
Poe!

01:18:29.914 --> 01:18:32.258
Poe!

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:42.392
The killer escaped.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.474
My horse is gone.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:53.738
What about Fields? He was shot.

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:55.523
He's at Doc Clements'.

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:57.987
What of you?

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.699
The paper goes to press
in three hours.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:04.991
There was an empty grave.
It had Emily's name on it.

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:08.081
That was his clue.
That's why he sent us there.

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:12.248
Perhaps, or to kill again.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:16.802
I'm sorry, Poe. This is my fault.

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:19.464
I should never have gene ahead
with the hall.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:21.974
These were my stories.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:25.477
Your daughter's love for me
is the reason another man's dead.

01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:27.013
Go to Doc Clements.

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:29.056
I have one more story to write.

01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:37.405
Edgar.

01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:40.067
For today, she's still alive.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.454
Doctor, let me go!

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:55.750
Let me go!
We're running out of time!

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.214
For God's sake,
a bullet is in your chest!

01:19:58.377 --> 01:20:01.426
Lie down and let me do my job
before you bleed to death.

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:03.932
The son of a bitch
is gonna kill her today.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:06.935
So you cut the bullet out
and you patch me up now!

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:10.724
There's a bottle of whiskey
in the kitchen. Bring it here.

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.273
- What the hell is that?
- A magnet.

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:17.530
To find the bullet to cut it out.

01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:22.159
Soak that pillowcase in the whiskey,
and give him the rest. He'll need it.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.502
<i>The gossamer white of bone</i>

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:43.013
<i>was now visible beneath
the tattered meat of her fingertips,</i>

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:46.927
<i>as Emily clawed madly
at the wooden slats of her coffin,</i>

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:49.811
<i>a desperate, drowning animal.</i>

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:55.768
<i>The dirt rose around her,
the inescapable sand of an hourglass,</i>

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:57.481
<i>as her final breath of air</i>

01:20:57.644 --> 01:21:01.945
<i>slipped her into the twilight
of consciousness until.</i>

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:41.006
<i>He knew now that all hope was lost.</i>

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:45.545
<i>He had failed his beloved, and
there was one last thing left to do.</i>

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:47.713
<i>One last act.</i>

01:22:51.758 --> 01:22:56.559
"A final desperate plea:
one life offered for another's."

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:59.100
Oh, Mr Poe, no... No, you can't!

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:01.689
- Set the print, Ivan.
- But, sir...

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:03.820
Do it!

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:06.198
You can't take it as your fault,
Mr Poe.

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:08.279
Is there someone else you'd blame?

01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:10.490
It's the killer who's to blame, sir.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:13.155
- Let me read that.
- Sir, I need to...

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:20.880
"Poe could feel the poison
already feeding on his blood,"

01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:23.461
"as the maggots were soon to do."

01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:25.422
Jesus, Edgar...

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:28.929
- Making enough money, Henry?!
- Mr Poe, don't! Mr Poe!

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:30.555
Will it sell?!

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:32.591
- Will it?!
- Mr Poe!

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:34.180
You madman!

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:37.472
I'll have you thrown in jail,
you damned animal!

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:40.517
I'll send you to hell! Huh?! Hell!

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:43.310
Mr Poe, don't. It's not worth it.

01:24:11.672 --> 01:24:13.549
Clements!

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:58.849
I'm sorry, Mr Poe. I fell asleep
waiting for you and the inspector.

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.810
- What time is it?
- Just past six, sir.

01:25:01.972 --> 01:25:04.066
The paper's here for you.

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:09.943
Rather remarkable seeing that
people are stealing others' papers.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:12.608
They can't print enough,
with the election today

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:15.368
and this horrible killing
they keep writing about.

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:19.247
Here's something else for you,
Mr Poe.

01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:30.509
"It is a masterpiece, Mr Poe.
An epitaph worthy of your gifts."

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:35.973
- When did this come?
- I don't know, but before the paper.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.759
- How do you know that?
- It was under the paper.

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:41.019
Impossible.
Look at the streaks in the ink.

01:25:41.178 --> 01:25:43.556
- I don't understand.
- It's been rained on.

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:48.273
- It rained last night before dawn.
- But the newspaper is bone dry.

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:50.529
I'm not sure what...

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:54.533
The paper was delivered later,
after it stopped raining.

01:25:54.691 --> 01:25:58.662
This note was written in response
to what I wrote in this newspaper.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:02.745
He delivered the note
before the paper.

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:05.286
So he knew the story in advance.

01:26:07.954 --> 01:26:10.673
He'd already read it.

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.715
Where's my gun?!

01:26:25.305 --> 01:26:26.852
Damn it.

01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:46.710
The ink.

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:56.840
It's printing ink.

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:02.304
The "Patriot".

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:12.110
Henry, you're gonna tell me
where she is.

01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:14.067
- Henry!

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:18.734
Tell me, where is sh...?

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.768
Ivan.

01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:54.402
Surprised?

01:27:56.563 --> 01:27:58.440
Where is she?

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:00.860
Dying.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.199
More quickly than I expected.

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:06.490
So I had to speed things along
and deliver the morning edition

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:09.409
so you could finally realise
it had to be...

01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:12.671
none other than your humble
typesetter and biggest fan.

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:17.801
A drink?

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:25.683
You don't know how I've looked
forward to this moment, sir.

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:27.685
To sit here like this,

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:29.437
no more masks,

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:31.064
artist to artist.

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:33.066
Artist to artist.

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:36.729
Though I admit,
as I read your final chapter,

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:39.273
I felt more muse than artist.

01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:45.491
You're mad.

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:51.292
Really, Mr Poe?

01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:53.670
You're one to talk.

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:59.259
Where is Emily?

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:02.045
Just like that?

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:07.013
No probing the devious twists
and turns of man's darkest motives?

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:10.019
No prying into the mysteries
of his conscience?

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:11.805
So very unlike you, Mr Poe.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.475
Where is she?!

01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:16.518
Ow!

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:22.157
A rather disappointing denouement,
I have to say.

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:24.909
But that's life, isn't it?

01:29:25.068 --> 01:29:27.787
So much less satisfying than fiction.

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:30.324
It's time this story comes to an end.

01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:33.418
Very well.

01:29:33.577 --> 01:29:35.875
Give me the gun.

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:40.967
You've come this far, Mr Poe.
Are you really gonna back out now?

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:46.636
You know what happens next.
You wrote it, after all.

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:50.428
You either pull that trigger
and kill me and young Miss Emily

01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:52.847
or you give me the gun.

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:55.440
She will live.

01:29:55.599 --> 01:29:58.694
That was your solution, right?

01:30:10.697 --> 01:30:13.200
I have to admit, I don't cry easily,

01:30:13.366 --> 01:30:17.621
but you had me bawling like a baby.

01:30:17.787 --> 01:30:19.960
And I've always had a fancy
for poisons.

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:21.750
That's how I done my dad.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.636
The idea of drinking something
that will kill you

01:30:24.794 --> 01:30:27.092
but having time to carry on
a conversation

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:31.635
is, as they say, fraught
with dramatic possibilities, right?

01:30:31.801 --> 01:30:34.771
Listen to me.
Talking about dramatic possibilities

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:37.979
with one of the greatest writers
of our time.

01:30:38.141 --> 01:30:42.863
I must say, it has been a profound
honour working with you, sir.

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:45.566
Working with me?

01:30:45.732 --> 01:30:48.736
I know they're your ideas.
I'm just borrowing.

01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:51.576
Except for Valdemar's tongue.
That was me.

01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:54.742
- Quite a subtle metaphor, I thought.
- Subtle?

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:56.785
It made no sense at all.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:31:00.422
Even in the end,
I'm confronted by a plagiarist

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:04.050
without even the originality
to invent themselves.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:05.802
I've concocted you.

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:09.181
I couldn't agree more.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:12.058
I am your crowning achievement.

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:14.720
Your masterpiece.

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:18.732
In whose world do we each exist
right now, Edgar?

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:21.188
Mine, or yours?

01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:24.900
I don't really know the answer.

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:28.366
It's quite brilliant.

01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:31.862
Well... go on, sir.

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:38.493
Bottoms up.

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:46.926
I need a carriage now!

01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:48.632
- Inspector!
- I need a carriage.

01:31:48.795 --> 01:31:51.218
And send a messenger
to Charles Hamilton's house.

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:54.225
Tell him to get to
the "Baltimore Patriot". Do it!

01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:10.234
<i>So it has been written:
I will die today.</i>

01:32:12.569 --> 01:32:15.448
<i>A hole of mouldering earth awaits.</i>

01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:20.289
<i>It is a just end to a man
consumed by death his entire life.</i>

01:32:20.452 --> 01:32:23.831
<i>Emily, take this kiss upon thy brow.</i>

01:32:23.997 --> 01:32:26.921
Really good stuff, sir.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:28.676
A poet to the end.

01:32:30.587 --> 01:32:32.885
I suppose this bit
is for Miss Hamilton.

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:35.637
Where is she?

01:32:36.926 --> 01:32:39.645
- Where is she?
- I tell you, Mr Poe,

01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:43.354
I used to live for your stories,
just live for them.

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:45.939
When you stopped writing...

01:32:47.687 --> 01:32:49.860
I guess I went a little nuts.

01:32:50.023 --> 01:32:53.197
But I kept on believing,
even when you closed me out.

01:32:53.359 --> 01:32:55.111
I still believed in your vision,

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:57.701
in a future where people
would stand in lines

01:32:57.864 --> 01:33:02.665
to see the kind of things that
only people like you and I could see.

01:33:02.827 --> 01:33:05.671
I knew you had one more in you, sir.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:11.003
No one will ever forget you.

01:33:16.716 --> 01:33:18.559
Have you ever been to France?

01:33:18.718 --> 01:33:21.813
There's a young writer over there -
Jules Verne.

01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:24.065
- You heard of him?
- What?

01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:25.726
Paris...

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:29.024
He really reminds me of you, sir.

01:33:29.187 --> 01:33:32.236
Where is she? You owe me!
Where is she?!

01:33:32.398 --> 01:33:35.072
"Anything was better than this agony."

01:33:35.235 --> 01:33:38.580
"Anything was more tolerable
than this derision."

01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:42.538
"I could bear those hypocritical
smiles no longer."

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.953
"The Tell-Tale Heart."

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.999
She's here... She's here.

01:33:48.164 --> 01:33:50.587
- Carriage for Mr Reynolds!

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:54.095
On my way in just a moment!

01:33:54.254 --> 01:33:56.473
Goodbye, Mr Poe.

01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:01.185
I've enjoyed our time together.

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:04.522
Reynolds...

01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:14.650
Almost...

01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:05.833
Emily!

01:35:16.419 --> 01:35:18.672
Emily?

01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:20.932
Answer me.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.929
Emily! Please, answer me!

01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:38.032
Oh, my God.

01:36:04.926 --> 01:36:06.553
Emily...

01:37:07.363 --> 01:37:09.741
Emily... Emily...

01:37:24.297 --> 01:37:26.470
Emily.

01:37:26.632 --> 01:37:31.889
Open your eyes.

01:37:32.055 --> 01:37:34.399
Emily, open your eyes.

01:37:35.892 --> 01:37:37.860
Yeah.

01:37:42.607 --> 01:37:44.701
Oh, yeah.

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:47.863
Is it really you?

01:37:49.947 --> 01:37:52.917
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:37:56.204 --> 01:37:58.252
I'm here.

01:37:58.414 --> 01:38:00.792
I came for you.

01:38:02.835 --> 01:38:05.179
Okay.

01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:13.642
Stay awake.

01:38:13.805 --> 01:38:16.183
I have you, always.

01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:19.486
We're going home.

01:38:19.644 --> 01:38:22.989
- You did mean it?
- Mean what?

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:25.525
When you said you would marry me.

01:38:25.691 --> 01:38:27.819
In this life and the next.

01:38:31.989 --> 01:38:34.492
Clear the way! Clear the way!

01:38:34.659 --> 01:38:36.411
What's wrong with you? Make way!

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:38.955
- Where's Poe?
- He was here a moment ago.

01:38:39.122 --> 01:38:40.715
Poe!

01:38:40.873 --> 01:38:42.921
Hurry!

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:48.965
Where is Edgar? Where is Edgar?

01:38:49.132 --> 01:38:50.975
Now, be careful.

01:38:51.134 --> 01:38:52.602
Go, go, go!

01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:18.123
Sir?

01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:20.288
You are Edgar Poe, correct?

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.250
I am.

01:39:25.418 --> 01:39:27.216
For a few more minutes, anyway.

01:39:27.378 --> 01:39:30.598
Are you all right?
You look a little the worse for wear.

01:39:30.756 --> 01:39:32.804
Is there someone I can call for you?

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:37.062
- Reynolds.
- You want me to find Reynolds?

01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:39.223
Does he have a first name?

01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:40.983
No.

01:39:42.143 --> 01:39:46.944
Tell Fields...
his last name is Reynolds.

01:39:47.106 --> 01:39:50.531
I'm sorry, sir,
you're not making much sense.

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:57.954
Tell Fields.

01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:07.297
The Lord help my poor soul.

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:49.965
Mr Fields?

01:40:50.127 --> 01:40:52.630
- I'm Dr John Morgan.
- Doctor.

01:40:53.673 --> 01:40:56.847
- Do you have a cause of death?
- I'm sorry, I don't.

01:40:57.009 --> 01:40:58.886
I have a few ideas but...

01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:02.353
As you know, he was brought in
in a very deranged state.

01:41:02.515 --> 01:41:04.483
I'm told he was ranting.

01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:06.110
Yes.

01:41:06.269 --> 01:41:10.866
He kept going on and on about telling
you that your last name is Reynolds.

01:41:11.023 --> 01:41:13.572
Is that helpful, or just gibberish?

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:15.577
Maybe both.

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:21.455
Well, thank you for your help,
Doctor.

01:41:21.617 --> 01:41:24.336
I'd be interested in hearing
your final analysis.

01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:32.337
<i>Take this kiss upon thy brow,</i>

01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:38.010
<i>And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow</i>

01:41:38.175 --> 01:41:44.023
<i>You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream.</i>

01:41:44.181 --> 01:41:49.654
<i>All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.</i>

01:41:57.445 --> 01:42:00.574
Mr Reynolds, please follow me
to your carriage.

01:42:28.476 --> 01:42:30.820
Merci pour votre aide.

01:42:34.357 --> 01:42:36.200
Hello, Ivan.
