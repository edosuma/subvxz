00:24.791 --> 00:25.758
Michael!

00:26.960 --> 00:28.359
I want to find out
who killed her.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.690
That's why I'm here.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.924
Beautiful models,
all bringing in fortunes

00:32.064 --> 00:34.260
in jewels,
only to have them stolen.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.561
Until two years ago,
it seems you didn't exist.

00:36.636 --> 00:37.762
You could have fooled me.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.703
How nice of you to join us.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.468
KITT, get over here.

00:42.442 --> 00:45.536
That young man was talking
to his car, Maurice.

00:45.612 --> 00:47.170
Too late to slow down, pal.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.010
And it may be
too late to turbo, Michael.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.640
Better not be.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.263
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:08.335 --> 01:10.530
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:10.604 --> 01:12.231
who does not exist.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.840
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:20.914 --> 01:23.314
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent

01:23.383 --> 01:25.681
the helpless, the powerless

01:25.752 --> 01:28.744
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.497
So, I looked Mr.
Hollywood Producer right in the eye,

02:20.573 --> 02:21.733
and I said:

02:22.042 --> 02:25.534
"Do you really expect to put
a price on beauty like this?

02:26.179 --> 02:28.977
That would be like
trying to sell the sunrise. "

02:29.049 --> 02:31.040
So Mr. Producer nods and says

02:31.117 --> 02:33.312
that is exactly
what he wants to do,

02:33.386 --> 02:35.081
to sell the sunrise.

02:35.355 --> 02:36.879
So what could I do?

02:37.123 --> 02:39.182
I smiled dramatically,
and I said:

02:39.459 --> 02:40.949
"Well,
if that's the way you feel,

02:41.094 --> 02:42.891
make sure
it's a big price. "

02:44.798 --> 02:47.028
Rachel, it's our
chance to get out of here

02:47.100 --> 02:49.091
it's something we
always hoped for.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.434
It's not right.
Not this way.

02:53.373 --> 02:54.670
Chris, we can wait.

02:54.741 --> 02:55.901
For what?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.209
Old age?

03:00.280 --> 03:01.975
There's got to be
another way, Chris.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.810
There's got to be.

03:04.484 --> 03:05.849
Please.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.351
I can't.
I'm sorry.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.117
Rachel, wait a minute.

03:15.795 --> 03:16.762
Hey, are you okay?

03:16.830 --> 03:17.762
Yes.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.494
No, I don't know.

03:21.568 --> 03:22.830
Lauren, I'm going home.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.231
Well, I'll
drive you then.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.465
No, you shouldn't leave.
It's okay.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.804
I'll hardly be missed. Look, I'll
take you, and I'll come right back.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.827
Are you gonna be all right?

04:29.769 --> 04:32.203
Michael, I'm
not sure I understand.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.330
What will these
models be wearing?

04:34.407 --> 04:35.897
Next spring's fashions. Why?

04:35.975 --> 04:38.307
The clothing last spring
seemed satisfactory.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.777
Why create new apparel?

04:39.846 --> 04:42.076
KITT, people's tastes change.

04:42.148 --> 04:44.446
They like new designs,
new lines.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.184
Why can't people be content
with what they have?

04:47.253 --> 04:49.016
Think of it this way, KITT,

04:49.122 --> 04:52.558
if Detroit had been content,
you'd still be a Model T.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.613
Faster! That's it.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.775
Great,
really sexy, just there.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.318
That's wonderful.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.885
Lauren,
try that. That's it.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.218
Light's all right.
Wonderful.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.349
Move it over to the left.

05:26.459 --> 05:27.949
That's it. That's perfect!

05:28.061 --> 05:29.585
That's wonderful.
Just a little more.

05:29.696 --> 05:30.663
Come on.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.527
Really sexy.
I can feel it. Really sexy.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.089
That's it.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.862
Lauren, fall back.

05:37.737 --> 05:40.399
That's it.
Why don't you take a break?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.569
Hi.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.442
Mmm.

05:59.058 --> 06:01.822
By the way,
I'm Michael Knight.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.593
After all this,
you had better be.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.928
Mr. Miles
described you perfectly.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.331
Thanks for coming.

06:08.401 --> 06:09.663
Oh, it's my pleasure.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.897
I told everyone that
you were an old flame.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.496
That'll help
explain you being here.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.769
That's what the hug
and kiss were all about.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.037
Oh.

06:18.778 --> 06:19.904
Not a bad cover.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.606
Why don't we go
somewhere we can talk?

06:21.681 --> 06:22.943
Okay.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.083
What do you think
about these earrings?

06:32.258 --> 06:33.953
They are okay.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.592
What do you
think of these?

06:35.728 --> 06:37.127
They are okay.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.063
Glad to be of service.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.235
I don't care what
the police report said,

06:46.372 --> 06:48.203
Rachel did not
commit suicide.

06:48.274 --> 06:49.901
Lauren,
I never said that she did.

06:49.976 --> 06:53.002
All I'm saying is that
everything pointed to that.

06:53.079 --> 06:57.038
No sign of struggle, no
forced entry, nothing stolen

06:57.116 --> 06:59.414
and an empty bottle
of sleeping pills.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.817
She had those
pills for over a year.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.515
Michael, the night
she died, she was upset.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.592
More than upset,
she was scared.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.490
She said she had
an argument with Chris,

07:08.561 --> 07:09.960
but it was more than that.

07:10.029 --> 07:12.395
That's why I came
to the Foundation.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.195
Look, she couldn't
have killed herself.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.696
She had too much to live for.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.267
I want to find
who killed her.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.206
Who and why.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.809
Me, too.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.572
Lauren,
that's why I'm here.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.011
Thanks.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.239
I better get back.

07:31.317 --> 07:32.284
Okay.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.746
Come on,
Nancy, we got to get going.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.048
Lauren's got another booking.

07:36.155 --> 07:37.247
There's Lauren.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.552
If you want to book her, it's
gonna be more money for you.

07:39.659 --> 07:40.751
Let me
check that artwork.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.918
Who's the quarterback?

07:42.028 --> 07:44.895
Oh, that's Nina Jurgenson,
Bernie's right hand.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.933
Bernie Mitchell, "The Man
who Makes the Stars Shine. "

07:48.001 --> 07:50.265
Well, that's some
press agent's creation.

07:50.336 --> 07:52.201
Actually,
Bernie is a really sweet guy

07:52.272 --> 07:55.366
who happens to be a genius
at developing talent.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.405
Rachel was one
of his favorites.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.708
Lauren, darling, we said
take a break, not a vacation.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.077
Okay, see you later.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.512
Bye, sweetheart.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.675
I am Nina Jurgenson,
Mr. Knight.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.376
Lauren told me all about you.

08:07.453 --> 08:09.944
Very nice to meet you, but
please, call me Michael.

08:10.056 --> 08:12.115
Oh, Michael.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.992
We don't encourage the
boyfriends to attend the sessions

08:16.062 --> 08:18.963
the girls tend to
lose their concentration.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.393
Well, we wouldn't
want that, would we?

08:21.534 --> 08:23.058
Certainly not.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.369
Okay, girls,
let's get moving quicker.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.912
Come on, Lauren.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.349
KITT, give me
an address on Chris Carlson.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.447
Right away, Michael.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.028
The address is
997 Grandby Street.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.728
Michael, I didn't realize
you knew that young woman.

08:57.804 --> 09:01.433
Lauren? I don't. I didn't.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.374
For two strangers, you
appeared awfully familiar.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.037
Were you spying on me?

09:07.146 --> 09:08.477
I was simply monitoring you.

09:08.614 --> 09:09.979
It's part of my job.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.450
Yeah, well, what you were
monitoring was part of my job.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.814
It's nice work
when you can get it. Mmm!

09:42.415 --> 09:44.508
"Carlson. Number 5."

10:30.830 --> 10:33.264
KITT, see if you can
trace the incoming call.

10:33.499 --> 10:34.898
Yes, Michael.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.099
Hello?

10:39.172 --> 10:40.469
Monsieur Carlson, please.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.805
Speaking.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.207
Mr. Carlson,
this is Phillip Rambeaux.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.174
We have received
your cable regarding

10:47.313 --> 10:49.076
the diamond
necklace and earrings.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.514
If the gems are of the
quality you indicated,

10:51.584 --> 10:54.075
we would be most happy
to represent them for you.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.211
Okay, good.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.552
Your cable indicated you might be
in Europe as early as next week.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.216
I look forward to
hearing from you.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.293
Good.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.292
Au revoir.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.558
Any luck?

11:07.633 --> 11:10.193
It was placed from the
offices of Rambeaux and Sons

11:10.269 --> 11:12.169
in Geneva, Switzerland.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.002
Rambeaux and
Sons is one of the largest

11:19.078 --> 11:21.103
jewelry makers
in all of Europe.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.273
But... but
that doesn't make sense.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.546
Rachel and Chris put every
penny they earned into the bank

11:26.619 --> 11:28.450
to buy a farm
back in Ohio.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.682
The closest Rachel ever got to
diamonds was the costume jewelry

11:31.791 --> 11:34.555
that Bernie gave us to
wear in the photo sessions.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.460
He gave it to you?
You mean, to keep?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.792
Sometimes.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.833
In fact, Rachel just
got back from France

11:40.967 --> 11:42.935
with a really
beautiful necklace.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.096
If you don't mind, I'd
like to see that necklace.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.635
Why?

11:50.977 --> 11:53.468
I don't know, got a hunch.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.738
Wait a minute.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.678
If that stuff were real,
it would be worth a fortune.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.083
Easily worth
a trip to Switzerland.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.483
But I don't get it.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.614
I mean, why would
Bernie give it to Rachel

12:05.725 --> 12:07.192
and not tell her about it?

12:26.245 --> 12:28.145
If you keep abusing that vehicle,

12:28.214 --> 12:31.012
I'm going to report
you to the Auto Club.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.594
Oh, my God.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.826
The guy who just left
the building, ID his car.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.492
You stay here and
don't touch a thing.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.900
What...

12:57.877 --> 12:59.572
KITT, get over here.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.816
What do you have?

13:10.923 --> 13:12.390
The plates on
the car were stolen.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.925
It's heading north.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.798
That young man was talking
to his car, Maurice.

13:24.837 --> 13:28.705
Can you imagine talking to
something that can't talk back?

13:31.944 --> 13:34.208
Michael, the car we're
pursuing just parked

13:34.280 --> 13:35.645
at 997 Grandby Street.

13:35.715 --> 13:38.343
That's where
Rachel's boyfriend lives.

14:12.084 --> 14:13.108
Carlson!

14:13.185 --> 14:15.016
Michael, be careful.
My sensors indicate...

14:39.311 --> 14:40.471
Michael, are you all right?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.672
No.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.575
This job is getting to
be a pain in the neck.

15:15.214 --> 15:17.739
Michael, there's
a lot of traffic up ahead.

15:29.895 --> 15:32.056
Michael, there's a red light.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.829
And he ran it.
Too late to slow down, pal.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.630
And it may be too
late to turbo, Michael.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.227
Better not be.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.206
Michael, we can't.

16:27.286 --> 16:28.514
I know.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.015
I know.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.283
Doesn't make any sense, Michael.

16:35.394 --> 16:38.329
All this intrigue
over costume jewelry?

16:42.268 --> 16:45.533
What if the costume jewelry
wasn't just cut glass?

16:45.704 --> 16:48.070
What if it was real?
Devon, I did some checking.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.608
It turns out Rachel's boyfriend
was an amateur rock hound.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.473
And he could
recognize real jewels.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.103
He could have.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.647
And if he did,

16:55.714 --> 16:57.375
and he wanted to
sell the jewelry,

16:57.449 --> 17:01.112
that might explain why Rachel was
so worried the night she was killed.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.519
Are you suggesting
that he killed her?

17:03.622 --> 17:08.457
No. Rachel came home that night
very early, very unexpected.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.588
She surprised
someone in her apartment.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.497
What if that guy was
looking for jewelry?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.233
Yes, you may have something,
Michael.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.194
In the last year
and a half, six models

17:20.271 --> 17:22.240
from the Mitchell
Agency were robbed.

17:22.308 --> 17:25.106
And each reported
costume jewelry missing.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.906
She surprised him.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.545
And the guy who killed her tried
to make it look like suicide.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.380
But he couldn't
find the necklace.

17:33.452 --> 17:36.182
Which explains the man you
saw leaving Lauren's apartment.

17:36.288 --> 17:38.813
That's right, but he still
couldn't find the necklace.

17:38.924 --> 17:41.017
So, he figures
Rachel's boyfriend's got it,

17:41.126 --> 17:42.923
decides to head
over to his place.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.859
Unfortunately, for him.

17:49.001 --> 17:53.404
Beautiful models, all
bringing in fortunes in jewels

17:53.472 --> 17:56.339
from foreign countries,
only to have them stolen.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.741
It's intriguing, but it just
doesn't quite make sense.

18:00.779 --> 18:03.111
I mean, what possible
purpose could it serve?

18:03.182 --> 18:04.581
I don't know.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.845
It's a question I'd
like to ask Mr. Mitchell.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.011
Tea?

18:08.187 --> 18:09.586
No, thank you.

18:09.688 --> 18:11.485
I'm going to a party.

18:22.568 --> 18:24.695
I suppose this
party is another phase

18:24.837 --> 18:26.998
of your undercover
work with Lauren.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.302
Hey, it's a tough job but...

18:29.375 --> 18:31.900
I know, someone has to do it.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.944
I am delighted to see you
wearing a tuxedo, though.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.641
I thought you
weren't into fashions.

18:36.715 --> 18:38.842
I'm not into
the irrational need

18:38.984 --> 18:41.111
to constantly change
the design of clothing.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.381
Oh, well, excuse me.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.557
The tuxedo,
however, is a classic,

18:45.658 --> 18:48.422
it has changed very little
during the past 100 years.

18:48.494 --> 18:49.961
Oh, yeah?
Just so you know,

18:50.062 --> 18:52.792
this tuxedo
is hot and scratchy and stiff.

18:53.332 --> 18:56.165
A small price to pay
for style and elegance.

18:56.235 --> 18:57.259
Oh, is that right?

18:57.336 --> 18:59.702
Well, maybe I should fit you
with a Continental Kit

18:59.772 --> 19:02.070
and a pair of mud flaps,
and see how you like it.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.233
You wouldn't dare!
Would you?

19:05.010 --> 19:06.568
Don't tempt me.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.874
Look's like its
quite a party, huh, KITT?

19:13.452 --> 19:15.716
Yes, it seems like it, Michael.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.043
Good evening.

19:51.557 --> 19:55.049
Well, it
happened in October, 1951.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.694
We had just parachuted
about 50 kilometers

19:58.764 --> 20:00.823
behind the North Korean lines,

20:00.899 --> 20:03.026
and the three guys
I jumped with, my buddies,

20:03.102 --> 20:05.935
they all bought it, pow,
pow, pow, just like that.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.566
And old Bernie bought
about four pounds of shrapnel

20:10.009 --> 20:12.170
into various
parts of his body

20:12.244 --> 20:15.975
that I'm afraid to mention, in
the presence of the gentlemen.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.311
But, I'm alive, right?
And it's no problem.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.952
Maybe a little one.

20:24.156 --> 20:28.286
Uh, when I go to airports, I have
to go through the metal detectors,

20:28.394 --> 20:30.294
you ought to see
the looks I get.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.961
Now, I have another story
that might be funny,

20:35.034 --> 20:37.161
I mean,
this one was not that hot.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.303
I don't know who is he,
or what he's up to,

20:43.375 --> 20:44.808
but I don't like it.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.209
He didn't pass security,
either.

20:47.312 --> 20:48.506
He could be a problem.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.912
Could be?
He is a problem.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.111
If he isn't what he
says he is, we'll find out.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.252
Excuse me.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.853
I can't believe
it's Bernie.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.995
I can't believe it, I mean,

21:05.064 --> 21:06.793
he's been like
a father to us.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.533
I can't believe it.
Why Rachel?

21:09.601 --> 21:11.068
I don't know.

21:11.136 --> 21:13.627
That's what we're
here to find out.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.268
Lauren?

21:16.375 --> 21:18.275
I'm going to find
out what's going on.

21:18.343 --> 21:21.073
That's not the way
to do it, believe me.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.445
I talked to Rachel's
mom and dad last night.

21:31.557 --> 21:34.025
It was hard enough
for them to lose her,

21:35.094 --> 21:37.062
but to think that
she killed herself

21:37.129 --> 21:39.324
is just destroying them.

21:42.367 --> 21:45.894
We're going to find out what
really happened to Rachel.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.336
I promise.

21:48.574 --> 21:51.771
But we got to take
things one step at a time.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.206
Okay?

21:53.679 --> 21:56.739
Now, first thing that I want
to do is take a look around.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.942
Where is Bernie's office?

21:59.618 --> 22:00.744
It's at the end
of the hall.

22:00.853 --> 22:01.979
Okay.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.578
Michael,
I'm going with you.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.054
No, you're not.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.024
I want you to stay,
keep an eye on things.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.923
Michael, I want to...
Lauren,

22:09.061 --> 22:10.892
we're supposed to
be in love here.

22:11.697 --> 22:14.825
Now, the first commandment
of being undercover

22:14.900 --> 22:18.461
is never, never, never,
blow your cover.

22:27.246 --> 22:30.147
Oh, excuse me.
Thank you.

22:31.650 --> 22:32.617
Enjoying yourself?

22:32.684 --> 22:33.582
Terrific.

22:33.652 --> 22:37.110
You know, Bernie sure knows
how to throw a great party.

22:37.656 --> 22:40.352
Bernie's a warm,
generous person.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.961
What about you, Michael?

22:43.061 --> 22:43.993
Me?

22:44.062 --> 22:45.927
Yes, you.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.155
We ran a check on you.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.599
Until two years ago,
it seems you didn't exist.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.798
No kidding.
You could have fooled me.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.135
KITT, I know there is a safe
in here somewhere.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.876
Give me a
clue, will you, buddy?

23:46.758 --> 23:48.851
Very, very nice!

23:49.728 --> 23:52.196
Okay, I'm gonna need
some help with this.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.058
Slowly, Michael.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.062
Good.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.036
There. Forty-three.
Now to the right.

24:00.572 --> 24:03.268
There. Twenty-seven.
To the left.

24:04.743 --> 24:07.234
That's it. Eleven.
Now to the right again.

24:10.482 --> 24:11.813
Seventeen.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.046
Voila!

24:15.120 --> 24:16.382
Call me if
somebody is coming.

24:21.059 --> 24:22.526
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

24:32.371 --> 24:34.737
KITT, you tell me,
are these real?

24:35.507 --> 24:37.441
Yes, real glass.

24:38.443 --> 24:39.671
Glass?

24:40.412 --> 24:42.744
Michael,
someone is approaching!

24:53.225 --> 24:54.351
Come on.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.021
Mmm.

25:20.719 --> 25:22.277
KITT, I'm in trouble.

25:22.387 --> 25:24.446
My sensors indicate
they're not armed, Michael.

25:24.556 --> 25:26.649
No, no,
not that kind of trouble.

25:26.758 --> 25:27.918
I'm stuck in a closet.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.823
Are they holding you captive?

25:29.895 --> 25:32.386
No. They're too busy
holding each other.

25:32.497 --> 25:34.897
Listen, just do something,
will you? Create a diversion.

25:34.966 --> 25:38.197
Oh, dear. What kind of
diversion would be appropriate?

25:38.270 --> 25:41.205
I don't care what you do!
Just get them out of here.

26:35.894 --> 26:37.361
Poltergeist!

26:54.279 --> 26:55.541
Poltergeist?

27:08.927 --> 27:10.792
So, Bernie's got
dummy corporations

27:10.862 --> 27:13.262
and numbered bank accounts
in the Grand Caymans.

27:13.331 --> 27:14.389
He's a busy man.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.400
And an extremely
wealthy man, too,

27:16.535 --> 27:18.469
if these
figures are accurate.

27:18.537 --> 27:22.496
Devon, can we find out where Bernie's
models have traveled last year?

27:22.574 --> 27:23.939
Hmm, certainly.

27:26.077 --> 27:29.103
The Grand Caymans are the
Caribbean version of Switzerland.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.046
It's an ideal
place to hide money,

27:31.116 --> 27:32.947
if you don't want
anyone to know about it.

27:33.018 --> 27:34.952
Or launder the stuff
you shouldn't have.

27:35.053 --> 27:38.352
Well, they've been to
Spain, France, Greece, and Chile.

27:38.457 --> 27:41.221
Devon, don't those
countries have currency restriction?

27:41.293 --> 27:42.817
Extremely strict regulations.

27:42.928 --> 27:46.159
In fact, it is impossible to transfer
large sums of money out of them.

27:46.231 --> 27:49.394
But if you used that money
to buy expensive jewels...

27:49.468 --> 27:52.631
And switched the real jewels in
place of the costume jewelry...

27:52.704 --> 27:54.797
You could whisk them
right through customs.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.966
On the necks and wrists of
beautiful American models.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.840
Once they're back in the States,
Bernie converts the jewelry to cash,

27:59.911 --> 28:02.505
transfers the cash to
those numbered bank accounts

28:02.581 --> 28:04.242
in the Grand Caymans
and takes

28:04.316 --> 28:06.443
a healthy percentage
off the top for himself.

28:07.252 --> 28:08.947
If you're
on the right track,

28:09.054 --> 28:12.148
these necklaces are
for Bernie's next customers.

28:13.458 --> 28:15.221
Orozco and Perrera.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.157
Well, they
certainly fit the profile.

28:17.295 --> 28:20.458
Wealthy industrialists who are
trying to get money out of Mexico.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.262
Devon, the next agency
shoot is in Mexico City.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.969
Lauren is scheduled
to leave tomorrow.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.597
I don't think Lauren
should be there alone.

28:28.673 --> 28:30.265
Oh, and Michael,
remember,

28:30.408 --> 28:33.343
the Foundation has no legal
jurisdiction in Mexico.

28:33.411 --> 28:36.539
Neither does Bernie Mitchell.
I'm gonna go talk to Lauren.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.105
Keep an eye on things, buddy.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.031
Of course, Michael.

29:08.213 --> 29:09.271
Keep that up,

29:09.347 --> 29:11.815
and you'll be on the wrong end
of a "Car Bites Dog" story!

29:34.272 --> 29:35.637
Lauren.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.882
Devon, I'm convinced
he forced her to go with him!

29:52.991 --> 29:55.152
Now I want to get down there.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.194
I'll make arrangements
to get you and KITT

29:57.262 --> 29:59.230
on a plane to Mexico City
as soon as possible.

29:59.331 --> 30:02.596
I do not intend to set one
wheel inside an airplane.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.227
KITT, buddy, I need
you to translate for me.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.292
Why don't you want to go?

30:06.371 --> 30:07.429
Because

30:08.807 --> 30:10.172
I don't like flying.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.402
But, KITT,
you've never flown before.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.674
One doesn't have to be bitten
by a dog to dislike dog bites.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.874
Besides,
if cars were meant to fly,

30:18.016 --> 30:20.143
they would have
been made with wings.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.819
All right, if that's how
you feel, I'll go alone.

30:22.921 --> 30:25.651
I'll just pick up
a rental car in Mexico City.

30:25.757 --> 30:28.988
A rental car?
Michael, you wouldn't.

30:30.629 --> 30:33.462
Perhaps I could make this
one flight an exception.

30:33.531 --> 30:36.398
I had a feeling you
would see it that way.

30:36.468 --> 30:37.833
Given what's happened,

30:37.902 --> 30:40.598
I'm still concerned about
sending you down there alone.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.606
Particularly
without any kind of plan.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.404
Funny you should mention
that, because I have an idea

30:45.477 --> 30:47.377
that makes this
a team effort

30:47.445 --> 30:49.606
and help us get
all the hard evidence we need

30:49.681 --> 30:52.514
to nail this guy
Bernie once and for all.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.415
That wasn't so bad, was it?

31:27.485 --> 31:29.578
Three hours in
a cargo hold was bad.

31:29.688 --> 31:32.885
Two hours in a Mexican
traffic jam was impossible.

31:33.191 --> 31:35.819
I only hope there was
a good reason for all this.

31:35.927 --> 31:38.521
KITT, I need you to record
everything that goes on inside.

31:38.596 --> 31:42.327
It would have been far easier and
cheaper to bring a tape recorder.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.095
Sure,
but it wouldn't be the same

31:44.169 --> 31:45.796
without your
cheery personality.

31:45.870 --> 31:47.269
Very funny.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.599
Feel the sun. Feel it.

31:49.674 --> 31:52.734
Feel it against each other.
It's really hot.

31:52.977 --> 31:55.002
Midday. Great!

31:55.346 --> 31:57.314
Uh, play with the burro,
por favor.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.815
Get behind his ear.
Okay, good.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.284
That's it! Good.
Good.

32:03.321 --> 32:06.256
Okay, take a break.
Uh, do we have any jewelry?

32:06.324 --> 32:07.416
There.

32:07.525 --> 32:08.992
Good. Let's see
one on...

32:16.468 --> 32:17.730
I'm so happy you are here.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.133
Yeah, me, too.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.636
Let's go
somewhere we can talk.

32:21.706 --> 32:23.037
Okay.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.441
Something's happening,
Michael.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.310
Something really big.

32:31.382 --> 32:34.943
Bernie's throwing a big party
tonight for some Mexican VIPs.

32:35.019 --> 32:38.182
Their names wouldn't happen to
be Perrera and Orozco, would they?

32:38.790 --> 32:39.882
Yes.

32:39.991 --> 32:41.481
Look out,
here comes Lady Macbeth.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.424
I'll fill you in later.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.759
I suppose, you are just
passing through town?

32:45.830 --> 32:48.128
You know, it's a beautiful day
for a drive. Isn't it?

32:48.199 --> 32:51.396
Oh, it's lovely that you don't
have to work for a living.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.595
But she does.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.069
Lauren,
they're waiting for you.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.572
Bye.
See you, sweetheart.

32:57.842 --> 33:00.538
You're becoming more trouble
than you're worth, Mr. Knight.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.705
I think Bernie would be
a better judge of that.

33:02.781 --> 33:05.648
Actually, I've got a
business proposition for him.

33:05.717 --> 33:09.676
Mr. Mitchell does not do business
with his models' boyfriends.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.255
Don't put money on it.

33:11.389 --> 33:12.879
Nina, we're ready.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.788
Be right with you, Nancy.

33:14.859 --> 33:16.759
We'll see, Mr. Knight.

33:18.229 --> 33:20.959
Pop in that cassette, buddy.
You're about to earn your keep.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.428
All right,
young man, I'm very busy.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.902
So why don't you tell me
what it is you want?

33:26.971 --> 33:28.962
If you don't mind,
I'd like a little privacy.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.405
After all,
it is confidential.

33:30.475 --> 33:31.806
Spit it out, lover boy.

33:31.876 --> 33:34.106
I thought we
would discuss money.

33:35.313 --> 33:36.575
Lots of it.

33:36.648 --> 33:39.947
Tucked away in cozy little
accounts in the Grand Caymans.

33:40.051 --> 33:41.575
Ring any bells?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.011
You've got no idea what
you're talking about.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.646
No?

33:46.024 --> 33:48.857
Five accounts in the
Chartered Bank of Grand Cayman.

33:48.927 --> 33:52.522
zero, ten, twelve

33:52.897 --> 33:55.058
sixty-two to sixty-six.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.595
That's for starters.

33:56.668 --> 33:57.862
Wait a minute.

33:58.937 --> 34:02.134
Just tell me something.
Who are you?

34:02.574 --> 34:05.202
Well, I'm more than
a persistent boyfriend.

34:05.276 --> 34:08.973
Just like you are more than
the owner of a modeling agency.

34:09.246 --> 34:12.909
I happen to represent a very
wealthy English expatriate

34:13.083 --> 34:15.348
who has vast
holdings in Mexico.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.909
Now, this particular
gentleman

34:16.987 --> 34:18.545
is planning to
leave the country

34:18.656 --> 34:20.647
and he'd like to
take his money with him.

34:20.757 --> 34:22.589
I have
letters of introduction.

34:23.328 --> 34:25.193
If you'd like
to check him out.

34:25.362 --> 34:27.024
I'd like to check him out.

34:27.098 --> 34:30.931
That's good, because he's looking
forward to meeting you, too.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.494
Adios, amigos.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.028
Lovely party, Bernie.

34:59.163 --> 35:00.528
Oh, thank you, Nina.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.769
Think our cover is working?

35:08.907 --> 35:10.238
So far.

35:11.542 --> 35:13.203
But we can't let
our guard down.

35:13.344 --> 35:15.039
Not even for a second.

35:19.550 --> 35:21.916
You take your work
very seriously, don't you?

35:21.986 --> 35:24.113
I'm a dedicated
professional.

35:24.555 --> 35:26.648
Almost compulsive
at times.

35:27.825 --> 35:31.022
I think I'm beginning to like
this undercover stuff.

35:31.095 --> 35:33.222
Think I could make
a career out of it?

35:33.298 --> 35:36.756
With practice
and qualified instruction.

35:41.906 --> 35:44.602
Senor, welcome.
Senorita.

35:44.776 --> 35:47.643
Senor Miles,
how nice of you join us.

35:48.046 --> 35:51.504
"But, soft! What light
through yonder window breaks?"

35:54.152 --> 35:56.211
I spend my life
around beautiful women.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.312
How could I
have missed you?

35:58.690 --> 36:00.351
Ships in the night,
perhaps.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.154
You,
my dear, could be a star.

36:04.095 --> 36:07.189
Mr. Mitchell, I'm afraid we
have a limited amount of time.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.495
Business, business,
always business.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.795
Never enough time for
life's true pleasure.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.963
See you later.
Come.

36:20.645 --> 36:22.772
Does he do that to
every woman he meets?

36:22.914 --> 36:25.075
Just the ones he likes.

36:25.149 --> 36:27.276
You must be Lauren.
I'm April.

36:27.418 --> 36:29.579
Michael's told me
so much about you.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.614
I didn't think there
was that much to tell.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.885
According to
Michael there is.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.552
Listen, I know how hard
this must be for you.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.663
But, I promise
it'll be okay, believe me.

36:47.271 --> 36:50.365
Letters of
introduction can be forged.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.369
Phone calls can't.

36:52.643 --> 36:55.840
Let's see if Senor Perez
really wrote this letter.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.246
KITT, intercept the call, will you?

37:03.154 --> 37:05.247
Intercept it?
And then what?

37:05.757 --> 37:06.883
Cover me, KITT.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.422
I hope my Spanish is up to par.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.230
Senor Bernie Mitchell
calling.

37:24.642 --> 37:27.270
Mr. Perez is
out for the evening.

37:27.845 --> 37:29.005
I see.

37:29.447 --> 37:31.039
It's important
that I speak with him.

37:31.182 --> 37:32.809
Do you know where he is?

37:32.884 --> 37:35.853
Si, he's visiting
his nephew, Arturo

37:35.953 --> 37:39.719
and then he's meeting Senor
Devon Miles for a late supper.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.292
I see, muchas gracias.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.630
My apologies, Mr. Miles.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.130
I beg your pardon?

37:48.199 --> 37:52.397
You're having a late supper with
Alfredo, please give him my regards.

37:52.470 --> 37:54.097
I'd be glad to.

37:54.172 --> 37:56.037
Now, if we can
conclude our business?

37:56.107 --> 37:57.665
I hate keeping
Alfredo waiting.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.909
Have you time
for one tequila?

38:00.011 --> 38:01.410
Of course.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.210
Gracias.

38:42.353 --> 38:44.150
Thanks, Bernie,
you don't have to come up.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.450
No, no, no,
darling, it's my pleasure.

38:48.926 --> 38:50.757
This won't take long.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.295
Lead the way.

38:58.736 --> 39:02.502
Flight 147
arriving at Gate 4 from Mexico City.

39:03.841 --> 39:06.207
No, no,
that part went just fine.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.211
Devon,
Lauren sailed through customs

39:08.279 --> 39:10.975
wearing a fortune in jewels,
no one even looked twice.

39:11.048 --> 39:13.346
Good. Now, all you
have to do is wait until

39:13.417 --> 39:15.681
Bernie Mitchell tries
to retrieve the jewels.

39:15.786 --> 39:17.754
Once he does, he's ours.

39:18.222 --> 39:21.157
That's the problem,
we're stuck here in customs.

39:21.392 --> 39:23.622
There's a small
army going over KITT

39:23.694 --> 39:26.629
with a fine-tooth comb, and
they won't take no for an answer.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.494
We'll see about that.

39:30.268 --> 39:32.896
Get me the senior officer
in customs, please.

39:35.072 --> 39:36.630
Thanks for
bringing me home, Bernie.

39:36.707 --> 39:37.935
Are you kidding?

39:38.009 --> 39:40.204
For my favorite model,
I'd move a mountain.

39:40.278 --> 39:43.145
Forget the mountain, Bernie. We
got a dozen things to do today.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.047
Yes, you were sensational,
sweetheart, let me tell you,

39:46.117 --> 39:48.483
take a few days off,
get some beauty rest, huh?

39:48.553 --> 39:50.043
Oh, um,

39:50.688 --> 39:53.623
maybe you better give me
the costume jewelry.

39:55.626 --> 39:57.491
Bernie, you said
that I could keep it.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.725
I know, but I've been looking
at it, it's not right for you.

40:00.798 --> 40:03.289
It's much too gaudy.

40:07.104 --> 40:10.164
All right, darling,
the charade is now over

40:10.241 --> 40:13.108
and Bernie is very
disappointed in you.

40:14.445 --> 40:16.208
I don't know
what you mean.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.771
I was watching you
on the flight back.

40:18.849 --> 40:21.044
I've given
diamonds to women before

40:21.118 --> 40:23.780
and I know how a woman acts
when she's wearing them.

40:23.888 --> 40:28.621
There's a special quality
in her eyes, a luminescence.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.957
I saw that quality in
your eyes. I saw that look.

40:34.599 --> 40:37.397
I saw it,
and I said to myself:

40:37.468 --> 40:41.996
"Why, why does she have
that look in her eye?

40:43.140 --> 40:46.007
"This beautiful young lady
should think

40:46.077 --> 40:48.875
she's wearing glass,
and she has that look. "

40:49.914 --> 40:53.680
Then, I realized that
you knew what was happening,

40:53.851 --> 40:56.285
you and your friends.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.689
Rachel liked you so much.

40:59.557 --> 41:01.047
She trusted you.

41:04.695 --> 41:06.458
You killed Rachel!

41:08.799 --> 41:10.391
You murdered her!

41:11.369 --> 41:14.236
I'm sorry you said that,
my lovely Lauren.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.567
It could cost you your life.

41:25.950 --> 41:28.350
It was absolutely outrageous!

41:28.586 --> 41:31.817
They poked and prodded me like
I was a common getaway car.

41:31.922 --> 41:33.651
How much further
to Lauren's?

41:33.758 --> 41:35.453
Approximately 11 minutes.

41:37.261 --> 41:39.855
Just when we were about to
close in on Bernie.

41:39.930 --> 41:42.057
You're worried about Lauren,
aren't you?

41:42.133 --> 41:44.897
Bernie's already
killed two people, KITT.

41:44.969 --> 41:47.733
It wouldn't be too
hard to make it three.

41:47.805 --> 41:50.069
That's Bernie Mitchell's car.

41:52.410 --> 41:54.571
Michael, they have
Lauren in that vehicle.

41:54.645 --> 41:56.112
That's what I was afraid of.

41:56.247 --> 41:57.737
What are you planning to do?

41:57.815 --> 41:59.407
Can't do much, pal,
except follow them

41:59.483 --> 42:01.417
and wait for an opening.

42:01.819 --> 42:04.549
He could kill her
if we make a move now.

42:05.122 --> 42:06.851
You know what, KITT?

42:07.758 --> 42:10.022
We need an ace in the hole.

42:10.094 --> 42:11.994
I recognize the tone
in your voice, Michael.

42:12.063 --> 42:13.325
Do you have an idea?

42:13.397 --> 42:15.627
Tell me what you
know about banks.

42:15.700 --> 42:16.689
Banks?

42:16.767 --> 42:20.669
Banks, and the electronic
transfer of money.

42:34.685 --> 42:36.482
Any progress, KITT?

42:36.554 --> 42:38.112
Come on, what did you get?

42:38.222 --> 42:40.417
I'm a computer,
not a miracle worker.

42:40.524 --> 42:43.982
Don't count miracles out,
we may need one.

42:58.509 --> 43:02.411
All right,
there's Bernie's mansion,

43:03.147 --> 43:05.707
let's see how he feels
about party crashers.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.394
Buzz me as soon as
you get something.

43:34.412 --> 43:36.107
What do you want,
lover boy?

43:36.180 --> 43:37.545
I want Lauren.

43:38.115 --> 43:39.480
Don't we all?

43:40.017 --> 43:43.885
Unfortunately, we can't always
get the things we want in life.

43:44.588 --> 43:46.055
I want Lauren.

43:48.159 --> 43:49.649
Give her to me.

43:50.895 --> 43:54.058
Or you can add kidnapping
to your list of charges.

43:54.965 --> 43:56.762
What list of charges?

43:57.401 --> 44:00.268
I plan to leave
the country within an hour.

44:00.771 --> 44:03.365
I found a lovely little island
in the Caribbean.

44:03.441 --> 44:04.635
I call it paradise.

44:04.708 --> 44:07.643
Unfortunately, you'll
never be able to see it.

44:07.745 --> 44:09.110
Michael, I've done it!

44:09.180 --> 44:11.512
Sorry, Bernie.
I just got word,

44:11.582 --> 44:13.209
there's trouble in paradise.

44:13.284 --> 44:14.581
What're you talking about?

44:14.652 --> 44:15.880
You're broke.

44:15.953 --> 44:19.218
Seems all the money's been transferred
from your numbered accounts.

44:19.323 --> 44:20.915
Some sort
of computer mix-up.

44:21.025 --> 44:22.390
Me broke?

44:22.460 --> 44:24.291
You don't believe me?
Check your computer.

44:24.929 --> 44:27.557
Come inside, ding-a-ling.

44:35.139 --> 44:36.538
Me broke!

44:37.241 --> 44:39.106
We'll wait right here.

44:55.459 --> 44:58.155
Wait a minute.
There's something wrong.

44:58.229 --> 45:01.255
It says only a dollar left!

45:02.066 --> 45:03.829
You could write
one of those books,

45:03.901 --> 45:05.960
"Grand Caymans on
a Dollar-a-Day. "

45:08.372 --> 45:11.739
You've done something wrong
here, something illegal!

45:21.352 --> 45:22.284
Michael!

45:28.192 --> 45:29.921
Hold it right there.

46:21.412 --> 46:23.607
Very nice, buddy.
Very nice.

46:23.781 --> 46:26.306
You can always
bank on me, Michael.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.288
It didn't take long
for Nina

46:38.362 --> 46:39.624
to start singing
like a canary.

46:40.064 --> 46:44.023
Turns out they got state and
federal authorities lined up,

46:44.101 --> 46:46.331
waiting for
a piece of Bernie.

46:47.838 --> 46:48.736
Here you go.

46:50.140 --> 46:51.334
Thanks.

46:55.079 --> 46:57.445
I remember when Rachel
and I moved in,

46:57.514 --> 47:00.381
we had such high hopes,
grand illusions.

47:00.484 --> 47:02.452
Lauren, you didn't pick
the wrong profession.

47:02.486 --> 47:04.420
You just picked
the wrong people.

47:04.521 --> 47:06.682
Besides, you're moving into
a new apartment.

47:06.790 --> 47:08.121
You wait and see.

47:08.192 --> 47:10.023
You're going to hang
in there, aren't you?

47:11.362 --> 47:13.091
Will I see you again?

47:13.163 --> 47:15.961
Unless you change your name
and move to Okinawa.

47:18.602 --> 47:19.933
You know what I'd like,

47:20.004 --> 47:22.529
now that we don't
have to pretend anymore?

47:23.340 --> 47:26.639
No, but I got a feeling
you are gonna tell me.

47:28.812 --> 47:30.177
To do it for real.

47:41.825 --> 47:43.053
Bye.

47:43.927 --> 47:45.087
Bye.

47:45.295 --> 47:48.196
Careful, wait a minute,
I need that mirror.

47:51.268 --> 47:52.462
Young man,

47:52.536 --> 47:54.060
Maurice and I
have reported you

47:54.138 --> 47:56.003
and that talking car
to the authorities.

47:59.410 --> 48:01.275
Cars don't talk,
do they, KITT?

48:01.578 --> 48:02.840
Absolutely not.

48:02.913 --> 48:04.847
No self-respecting car,
that is.

48:06.083 --> 48:08.881
You took the words
right out of my mouth, pal.
