00:01.301 --> 00:02.069
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
<i>"DEVIOUS MAIDS"...</i>

00:02.069 --> 00:03.971
MR. SPENCE?!

00:03.971 --> 00:06.974
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME HAPPENED?
MR. SPENCE HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

00:06.974 --> 00:09.209
ABOUT YOUR TRUST FUND...
IT'S GONE, TOO?

00:09.209 --> 00:10.711
YOU ALWAYS COULD PARTY
WITH THE BEST OF THEM.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.380
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT
IN A WHILE.
YOU OWE ME.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.450
(Valentina) YOU'RE
TAKING THIS REALLY WELL.
(sniffs) NO, NO, I'M GOOD.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.252
I'M--I'M GREAT, ACTUALLY.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.287
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M JULIE.

00:20.287 --> 00:21.989
I WORK NEXT DOOR
FOR THE HIGGINS.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.425
ARE YOU JEALOUS?
I AM JEALOUS.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.464
(Evelyn) MARISOL HAD
A NASTY LITTLE SHOCK TODAY.

00:30.464 --> 00:34.301
I BELIEVE SHE HAPPENED UPON
ONE OF YOUR NAUSEATING DVDs.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.502
THIS COULD BE DEVASTATING

00:35.502 --> 00:37.571
IF ANY OF THESE GOT OUT.
OH, MY GOD.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.605
MICHAEL!
(smack)

00:38.605 --> 00:39.706
(clinks and shatters)

00:39.706 --> 00:41.241
YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOU PERVERT.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.277
I AM NOT LEAVING HERE
WITHOUT THOSE DVDs!

00:43.277 --> 00:45.145
I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM
WHAT THEY CAME FOR...
(switch clicks)

00:45.145 --> 00:47.247
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS
NASTY LITTLE MESS BEHIND US.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.750
OH, AND, MARISOL...

00:49.750 --> 00:51.118
YOU'RE FIRED.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.731
YOU LIED TO OUR FACES.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.367
PRETENDING TO BE A MAID.

01:07.367 --> 01:11.038
PRETENDING TO BE OUR <i>FRIEND!</i>

01:11.038 --> 01:12.239
YOU WERE CLOSE TO FLORA.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.341
AND I NEEDED TO KNOW
THE TRUTH ABOUT HER.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.476
SO YOU ADMIT
YOU WERE JUST USING US?

01:16.476 --> 01:18.979
I AM TRYING TO GET
MY SON OUT JAIL!

01:18.979 --> 01:20.447
WELL, YOU CAN STOP
PRETENDING,

01:20.447 --> 01:23.083
'CAUSE I AM TELLING <i>EVERYONE</i>
WHO YOU REALLY ARE!

01:23.083 --> 01:25.385
I DON'T THINK SO.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.087
YOU JUST WATCH ME.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.423
WELL, THEN I GUESS I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TELL PERI WESTMORE

01:29.423 --> 01:32.125
THAT YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH HER HUSBAND.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.994
(voice trembles) WHAT?

01:33.994 --> 01:37.764
<i>YEAH.</i>
I KNOW ABOUT SPENCE.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.434
SO HERE IS THE DEAL.

01:40.434 --> 01:44.404
YOU DON'T TELL MY SECRET,
AND I WON'T TELL YOURS.

01:47.240 --> 01:50.110
I... <i>HATE</i> YOU!
(door opens and closes)

01:50.110 --> 01:52.546
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.
(Zoila) GUYS?

01:54.514 --> 01:57.017
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

02:01.054 --> 02:07.060
♪♪♪

02:21.308 --> 02:23.677
(doorbell rings)

02:26.980 --> 02:28.982
I'VE COME TO APOLOGIZE.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.052
REALLY?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.987
I FEEL SO BADLY...

02:33.987 --> 02:35.689
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER NIGHT.

02:35.689 --> 02:39.259
I HAD NO IDEA MR. STAPPORD
WOULD ATTACK YOUR HUSBAND.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.495
IS THAT ALL?

02:41.495 --> 02:45.532
I ALSO...
WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT

02:45.532 --> 02:49.202
I'VE GROWN FOND
OF YOU AND MR. POWELL.

02:49.202 --> 02:52.572
AND IF YOU COULD
FIND IT IN YOUR HEART

02:52.572 --> 02:54.174
TO FORGIVE ME,

02:54.174 --> 02:57.744
I WOULD LOVE TO COME BACK
AND WORK FOR YOU.

02:57.744 --> 03:01.415
GOOD HELP DOES MORE THAN
FOLD SHIRTS AND WASH DISHES.

03:01.415 --> 03:05.118
THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR US
MUST ALSO KEEP OUR SECRETS.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.721
AND SINCE YOU ARE INCAPABLE
OF DOING THAT,

03:07.721 --> 03:09.089
I'M SURE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND
WHY WE WILL NEVER

03:09.089 --> 03:11.191
ALLOW YOU
IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.765
(exhales deeply)

03:18.765 --> 03:22.502
(woman speaking Spanish
indistinctly)
(Rosie) SHH! SHH!

03:22.502 --> 03:25.572
MARISOL! COME HERE. SIT.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.174
TAKE OFF YOUR LOAD.

03:27.174 --> 03:30.210
SHE MEANT TO SAY...
(chuckles)
I GOT IT.

03:30.210 --> 03:34.347
THANK YOU.
<i>SO</i> HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

03:34.347 --> 03:37.084
WE'RE GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

03:37.084 --> 03:39.720
I'M FINE. WHY?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.521
WE HEARD THE POWELLS
FIRED YOU.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.191
NEWS TRAVELS FAST.

03:44.191 --> 03:45.759
ESPECIALLY ON THE L.P.L.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.328
(mouths words)
THE LATINA PIPELINE.

03:48.328 --> 03:49.763
OH. (laughs)

03:49.763 --> 03:51.998
WE ALSO HEARD MICHAEL STAPPORD

03:51.998 --> 03:54.634
GOT INTO A FISTFIGHT
WITH MR. POWELL.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.970
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GOSSIP
IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.405
BUT WHEN YOU DO...

03:58.405 --> 04:00.307
WE ARE SO HERE FOR YOU.

04:00.307 --> 04:03.176
THERE WAS SOME DRAMA, YES.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.344
AND YOU'RE OKAY?

04:04.344 --> 04:05.746
OH, I'M FINE.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.215
MM, GOOD.

04:08.215 --> 04:11.518
(envelope rustling)

04:11.518 --> 04:13.453
WHAT IS THIS?

04:13.453 --> 04:16.123
IT'S FROM ALL OF US.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.693
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.329
IT WAS OBVIOUS YOU TOOK
THAT JOB WITH THE POWELLS

04:22.329 --> 04:24.264
BECAUSE YOU NEEDED
THE EXTRA MONEY.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.733
(envelope rustles)
SO... UNTIL YOU FIND
ANOTHER JOB--

04:26.733 --> 04:28.268
WHICH WON'T BE LONG

04:28.268 --> 04:30.103
BECAUSE WE HEAR ABOUT
EVERY JOB THAT OPENS UP.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.239
GOD BLESS THE L.P.L.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.307
(sighs deeply)

04:34.307 --> 04:37.177
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GUYS DID THIS.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.045
WELL,
WHAT'S THE BIG SURPRISE?

04:39.045 --> 04:40.514
YOU'RE OUR FRIEND.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.985
AND THAT MEANS
WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.356
DID I SAY THAT RIGHT?
YOU DID.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.258
ABSOLUTELY. (chuckles)

04:51.258 --> 04:52.526
(chuckles)

05:00.333 --> 05:01.334
REMI?

05:01.334 --> 05:02.969
HEY, YOU.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.604
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
SO EARLY?

05:04.604 --> 05:07.040
IT'S, UH,
9:00 IN THE MORNING.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.477
IS IT? WOW. MUST HAVE
LOST TRACK OF TIME.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.646
YOU SPILLED SOMETHING
ON YOUR JACKET.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.248
OH. I'M NOT SURPRISED.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.683
ME AND SOME BUDDIES
WENT TO THIS CLUB LAST NIGHT.

05:16.683 --> 05:19.186
IT WAS <i>INSANE!</i>
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE GONE.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.221
I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE
ASKED ME TO GO.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.523
ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET ME
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.192
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:25.192 --> 05:27.060
MAY I HAVE THIS DANCE?

05:27.060 --> 05:29.229
(scoffs) HOW MUCH
DID YOU HAVE TO DRINK?

05:29.229 --> 05:31.665
NOT ONE DROP. COME ON.
DANCE WITH ME.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.600
REMI, THIS IS SILLY.
WHY?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.969
FOR STARTERS,
THERE'S NO MUSIC.

05:35.969 --> 05:41.007
THEN I'LL SING. (humming)

05:41.007 --> 05:42.709
YOU KNOW WHAT'S CRAZY?

05:42.709 --> 05:45.345
ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT NEVER DANCE.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.180
I MEAN, THE WORLD
IS FULL OF MUSIC,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.381
AND THEY CAN'T HEAR IT...

05:48.381 --> 05:52.485
WHICH IS SAD
BECAUSE LIFE IS SHORT.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.988
AND WE HAVE TO DANCE
WHILE WE CAN.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.990
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR EYES?

05:56.990 --> 06:00.060
WHAT?
YOUR PUPILS ARE <i>TINY.</i>

06:00.060 --> 06:03.029
OH. UH... IT'S--
IT'S--IT'S NOTHING.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.532
I'M JUST TIRED.
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GO TO BED.
OKAY.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.500
YOU WANT ME TO CLEAN
YOUR JACKET?

06:07.500 --> 06:10.437
UH, JUST GET IT LATER.
I'M GONNA GO CONK OUT.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.672
THANKS FOR THE DANCE.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.278
(indistinct conversations)

06:18.278 --> 06:20.580
(cell phone alert chimes)

06:24.384 --> 06:27.387
(buttons clicking)

06:31.258 --> 06:33.393
(cell phone alert chimes)

06:39.466 --> 06:41.735
I FELT AWFUL, IDA.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.737
THESE WOMEN DON'T MAKE
THAT MUCH.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.238
WHAT DID THEY HAVE
TO SACRIFICE

06:45.238 --> 06:47.173
TO SCRAPE
THAT MONEY TOGETHER?

06:47.173 --> 06:48.975
WELL, ONCE WE GET EDDIE
OUT OF JAIL,

06:48.975 --> 06:51.044
YOU CAN COME BACK
AND WRITE THEM <i>ALL</i> A CHECK.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.513
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.
THEY REALLY...

06:53.513 --> 06:55.048
CARE ABOUT ME.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.450
AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL
LIKE I'M USING THEM.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.519
YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT THAT
RIGHT NOW.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.121
EYES ON THE PRIZE.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.523
I mean,
we're getting so close.

07:03.523 --> 07:06.660
(sighs) THAT'S WHAT
I KEEP TELLING MYSELF.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.729
I'M ABOUT TO MEET ROSIE.
WE'LL TALK LATER?
Sure.

07:09.729 --> 07:12.165
OKAY. BYE.
(cell phone beeps)

07:14.467 --> 07:17.470
(cell phone alert chimes)

07:23.576 --> 07:27.180
(buttons clicking)

07:27.180 --> 07:28.481
HEY, YOU!
(gasps)

07:29.749 --> 07:32.085
SORRY. I'LL GET THAT
FOR YOU.
NO, NO!

07:32.085 --> 07:33.186
I'LL GET IT.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.990
I NEEDED ONE OF THESE
ANYWAY.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.226
YOU NEED
AN AFRICAN HORNED MELON?
YEAH.

07:40.226 --> 07:43.263
I'M MAKING, UM...
FLAN.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.232
SO... AFTER WE'RE DONE
SHOPPING,

07:46.232 --> 07:48.501
YOU WANT TO HAVE LUNCH?
MY TREAT.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.471
I CAN AFFORD
MY OWN LUNCH, ROSIE.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.707
BUT SURE. THAT'D BE--
THAT'D BE NICE.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.711
PROFESSOR SUAREZ?

07:57.711 --> 08:00.447
I SHOULD STOP BY
THE DELI COUNTER.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.481
OH, MY GOSH.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.984
I <i>KNEW</i> THAT WAS YOU.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.385
DO I KNOW YOU?

08:05.385 --> 08:07.988
PROFESSOR SUAREZ, IT'S ME--
MELISSA MORGAN.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.358
I HAD YOU FOR ENGLISH LIT.
PROFESSOR?

08:11.358 --> 08:13.393
"WE ARE ALL IN THE GUTTER,

08:13.393 --> 08:16.663
BUT SOME OF US ARE
LOOKING AT THE STARS."

08:16.663 --> 08:20.433
OSCAR WILDE. YOU WERE THE REASON
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.068
I READ YOUR BOOK TWICE.

08:22.068 --> 08:27.240
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M NOT
WHO YOU THINK I AM.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.710
WOW. OKAY.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.013
YOU JUST
<i>REALLY</i> LOOK LIKE HER.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.984
EXCUSE ME.

08:40.086 --> 08:43.223
WELL... THAT WAS WEIRD.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.758
YEAH.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.093
I GUESS I JUST HAVE
ONE OF THOSE FACES.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.462
HEY, LET'S HURRY UP
SO WE CAN TO GO LUNCH.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.664
I'M STARVING!

09:07.247 --> 09:11.284
(inhales deeply and sighs)

09:14.054 --> 09:16.489
(moans) WHATCHA DOING?

09:16.489 --> 09:18.992
WATCHING YOU SLEEP.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.427
THAT'S SORT OF CREEPY.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.629
(chuckles)
CAN'T HELP MYSELF,

09:22.629 --> 09:25.398
'CAUSE MOST WOMEN ARE NOT
THIS BEAUTIFUL IN THE MORNING.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.101
MM.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.169
MORNING?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.037
I SPENT THE NIGHT?

09:31.037 --> 09:32.972
(chuckles)
HEY, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.708
IT IS A VERY BIG DEAL.
WE HAD AN AMAZING TIME.

09:35.708 --> 09:38.578
WHY ARE YOU FREAKING OUT?
WE'RE FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.280
STAYING OVERNIGHT
IS AGAINST THE RULES.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.983
IT LEADS TO... EMOTIONS AND--
AND OTHER BAD STUFF.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.453
WAIT. YOU DON'T THINK
LAST NIGHT WAS EMOTIONAL?

09:46.453 --> 09:48.655
AFTER WE MADE LOVE,
I SEEM TO RECALL

09:48.655 --> 09:50.623
SOMEONE SHEDDING
A FEW TEARS.

09:50.623 --> 09:54.527
YEAH.
YOU GOTTA STOP THAT.
(chuckles)

09:54.527 --> 09:56.262
LOOK, MAKE ALL THE JOKES
YOU WANT.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.530
THIS IS MORE THAN
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.365
(zips dress)
NO. IT'S NOT.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.668
IT IS FOR ME, CARMEN.

10:01.668 --> 10:05.205
LOOK, I CAN REALLY SEE MYSELF
FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.707
AW.
OW!

10:07.707 --> 10:10.510
WORDS LIKE "LOVE"
AND "FOREVER" MAKE ME CRAZY.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.378
I'M NOT READY
TO GO THERE YET.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.080
AND IF YOU KEEP IT UP,
I SWEAR TO GOD,

10:14.080 --> 10:15.248
I'M GOING TO
RUN FOR THE EXIT.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.517
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT SLOW?
I GET IT.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.752
BUT I GOTTA FEEL LIKE
I'M MORE THAN JUST A BUDDY,

10:19.752 --> 10:21.621
ESPECIALLY AFTER LAST NIGHT.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.658
OKAY.
YOU CAN BE MY <i>BOYFRIEND.</i>

10:25.658 --> 10:28.261
YES!
DON'T GET EXCITED.
IT'S ANNOYING.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.629
UH, SORRY.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.598
BUT I'M VERY PLEASED
WITH THIS TURN OF EVENTS.

10:31.598 --> 10:34.000
(chuckles) AND JUST KNOW
WE'RE GONNA BE SO GOOD TOGETHER.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.735
(gasps) I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU
TO MEET MY MAMA.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.504
SHE'S GONNA L-- (grunts)
(slaps)

10:37.504 --> 10:41.574
(sighs)
YEAH, I DESERVED THAT ONE.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.577
(wheels clacking)

10:46.012 --> 10:47.380
(Evelyn) HERE SHE IS.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.483
THE TRAY LOOKS
ABSOLUTELY LOVELY.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.318
THANK YOU, DONG MEI.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.255
THIS IS YOUR NEW MAID?
ISN'T SHE PRECIOUS?

10:55.255 --> 10:58.258
LIKE A VASE FROM
THE MING DYNASTY.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.392
THE YEARS HAVE CRACKED
THE SURFACE,

10:59.392 --> 11:01.661
BUT THE FRAGILE BEAUTY
STILL REMAINS.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.598
(clattering)
OH, WATCH THE TRAY,
DARLING.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.501
DON'T WANT TO SPILL.
(speaks Chinese dialect)
(tray clatters)

11:08.501 --> 11:10.170
HER ENGLISH IS LIMITED.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.972
I'VE HAD TO LEARN CANTONESE
TO BRIDGE THE GAP.

11:12.972 --> 11:14.374
CANTONESE?

11:14.374 --> 11:15.575
(saucers clattering)
JUST A FEW USEFUL PHRASES.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.377
LIKE, "GET THE MOP,"
"WIPE THAT UP,"

11:17.377 --> 11:20.613
"PUT YOUR TEETH IN."
THINGS LIKE THAT.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.183
(clattering)

11:23.183 --> 11:25.251
ISN'T SHE A BIT OLD?

11:25.251 --> 11:26.519
SEE, NOW I THINK
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.021
HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN SAY
THEY HAVE A MAID

11:28.021 --> 11:30.256
WHO WAS THERE WHEN
THEY INVENTED THE WON TON?

11:30.256 --> 11:32.125
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.094
BUT SURELY THE AGENCY
HAD MORE SUITABLE CHOICES.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.664
THEY WON'T SEND ME ANYONE...

11:37.664 --> 11:40.266
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED
TO FLORA.
(clattering)

11:40.266 --> 11:41.267
(rattling)

11:41.267 --> 11:42.569
CAREFUL, SWEETNESS.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.338
HERE, LOOK AT--
LOOK AT THE CUP.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.241
LOOK--OKAY, JUST GIVE--
JUST GIVE ME THE POT.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.110
(speaks Cantonese)
DONG MEI.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.512
WHY DON'T YOU GET US

11:52.512 --> 11:55.548
SOME OF YOUR DELICIOUS
ALMOND COOKIES? ALL RIGHT?

11:58.451 --> 12:01.321
WHY NOT ASK MARISOL
TO COME BACK?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.623
(pot clatters, liquid pours)
MARISOL BETRAYED US.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.291
SHE'S THE REASON
ADRIAN IS HAVING

12:05.291 --> 12:07.026
RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
AS WE SPEAK.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.062
SHE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING

12:09.062 --> 12:10.663
MICHAEL WOULD REACT
SO VIOLENTLY.
(liquid pouring,
plates clacking)

12:10.663 --> 12:13.266
AND IF ADRIAN HADN'T
MADE THOSE VIDEOS...

12:13.266 --> 12:15.501
I TOLD YOU THAT
IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.104
I'M NOT JUDGING.
I'M TRYING TO HELP.

12:18.104 --> 12:21.975
WHEN I THINK OF THE HANDS
LIFE KEEPS DEALING YOU--

12:21.975 --> 12:25.178
THE LOSS OF YOUR SON,
ADRIAN'S DEVIANCY,

12:25.178 --> 12:28.214
AND THEN TO HAVE YOUR MAID
MURDERED IN THIS VERY ROOM...

12:28.214 --> 12:31.384
(dishes crash)
YOUR MAID MURDERED?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.020
WELL... (chuckles)

12:34.020 --> 12:36.322
THAT HAPPENED
A <i>LONG</i> TIME AGO.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.124
WAIT, WHY ARE YOU
TAKING OFF YOUR APRON?

12:38.124 --> 12:40.260
I NO WORK IN MURDER HOUSE!

12:40.260 --> 12:43.529
NO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
NO NEED TO BE CHILDISH!
(cup clatters)

12:43.529 --> 12:46.666
(shouting in Cantonese)

12:46.666 --> 12:48.368
YES, I HAD A MAID
WHO WAS MURDERED,

12:48.368 --> 12:49.969
BUT THAT MEANS THE ODDS
OF YOU BEING KILLED

12:49.969 --> 12:51.271
ARE PRACTICALLY NIL.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.074
EVEN AFTER SHE SAID,

12:55.074 --> 12:58.111
"YOU'VE MISTAKEN ME
FOR SOMEONE ELSE,"

12:58.111 --> 13:02.382
THIS GIRL WAS SURE THAT
MARISOL WAS PROFESSOR SUAREZ.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.151
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S STRANGE?
NOT REALLY.

13:05.151 --> 13:08.354
PEOPLE STOP ME ALL THE TIME
AND ASK IF I'M PENELOPE CRUZ.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.656
THAT HAPPENED ONCE
OVER TWO YEARS AGO.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.391
LET IT GO.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.761
THIS MAN WAS SO CONVINCED,
HE MADE ME SIGN AN AUTOGRAPH.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.630
BUT HE BECAME SUSPICIOUS
WHEN SHE MISSPELLED "PENELOPE."
(sugar packet rustles)

13:17.630 --> 13:19.265
ZOILA.
GUYS...

13:19.265 --> 13:22.702
I'M ASKING
A SERIOUS QUESTION HERE.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.571
WHAT IF MARISOL ISN'T
WHO SHE SAYS SHE IS?

13:25.571 --> 13:29.642
COME ON. WHY WOULD A PROFESSOR
PRETEND TO BE A MAID?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.377
MAYBE SHE'S HIDING
SOMETHING.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.646
MAYBE YOU'RE PARANOID.
HEY.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.648
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID
MARISOL WAS ASKING

13:35.648 --> 13:38.251
TOO MANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT FLORA, REMEMBER?

13:38.251 --> 13:40.153
THAT'S WHEN SHE FIRST
CAME HERE.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.221
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW HER,
I TRUST HER.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.524
YEAH.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.592
BUT SHE NEVER TALKS
ABOUT HER LIFE

13:46.592 --> 13:48.528
OR WHAT SHE DID
BEFORE SHE CAME HERE.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.663
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S WEIRD?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.466
I DON'T TELL YOU GUYS
EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.502
AND I'VE HAD SOME <i>CRAZY</i> STUFF
HAPPEN TO ME. (chuckles)

13:56.502 --> 13:59.439
DID SOMEONE ONCE MISTAKE YOU
FOR JENNIFER LOPEZ?

13:59.439 --> 14:03.476
YOU RESENT MY BEAUTY.
JUST ADMIT IT.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.644
(sugar packet rustles)
(chuckles)

14:04.644 --> 14:06.379
I DON'T KNOW.

14:06.379 --> 14:10.316
I THINK MARISOL
HAS SOME KIND OF SECRET.

14:10.316 --> 14:13.386
SO WHAT IF SHE DOES?
MARISOL IS OUR FRIEND.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.722
WHEN SHE IS READY TO TELL US
WHAT HER SECRET IS,

14:15.722 --> 14:17.357
WE WILL BE THERE FOR HER.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.392
OKAY?

14:19.392 --> 14:22.595
CAN I HAVE SOME SUGAR,
BEYONCé?

14:22.595 --> 14:24.731
I NEVER LIKED YOU.
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.065
(chuckles)
(laughs)

14:26.065 --> 14:28.234
(knock on door)

14:43.383 --> 14:45.318
(buckle clacks)

15:06.372 --> 15:08.975
(footsteps approach)

15:08.975 --> 15:10.510
I'M OFF TO THE DRY CLEANERS.
ANYTHING ELSE?

15:10.510 --> 15:14.514
YES. HERE'S REMI'S JACKET.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.016
GOD, WHAT DID HE DO
LAST NIGHT?

15:17.016 --> 15:18.384
THIS SMELLS <i>AWFUL.</i>

15:18.384 --> 15:20.987
YOU SHOULD SMELL THE CLOTHES
IN HIS DUFFEL BAG.

15:20.987 --> 15:23.990
HAVE THOSE NOT BEEN WASHED
SINCE HE CAME HOME FROM COLLEGE?
(washing machine door opens)

15:23.990 --> 15:25.291
I DON'T THINK THEY'VE
BEEN WASHED

15:25.291 --> 15:26.659
SINCE HE WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.528
(washing machine door closes)
I DON'T GET IT.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.296
THE BOY'S SMART ENOUGH
TO GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL,

15:30.296 --> 15:33.199
BUT HE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW
TO OPERATE A WASHING MACHINE?

15:33.199 --> 15:35.268
HE LEFT SOME DETERGENT IN HERE,

15:35.268 --> 15:38.037
SO AT LEAST HE WAS PLANNING
ON DOING SOME LAUNDRY.

15:38.037 --> 15:40.106
(Zoila) WHAT A PRINCE.

15:49.248 --> 15:50.516
(sighs)

16:06.332 --> 16:09.669
HEY! HAVE YOU SEEN
MY DUFFEL BAG?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.504
I-IT'S OVER THERE.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.379
THIS--THIS IS EMPTY.
W-WHY IS THIS EMPTY?

16:20.379 --> 16:22.381
I TOOK OUT THE DIRTY CLOTHES
TO WASH THEM.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.483
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.018
NOTHING. NOTHING. UM...

16:26.018 --> 16:27.987
I-I-I'M JUST CURIOUS.
WHEN YOU TOOK OUT THE CLOTHES,

16:27.987 --> 16:30.056
DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
A LITTLE PLASTIC BAGGIE IN HERE?

16:30.056 --> 16:32.325
YOU MEAN THE ONE
WITH THE DETERGENT?
HUH?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.526
THE DETERGENT.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.262
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
THAT'S--THAT'S--

16:36.262 --> 16:37.530
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH

16:37.530 --> 16:40.266
THE, UH, DETERGENT?
I USED IT.

16:40.266 --> 16:43.236
WHAT?
I USED IT TO WASH
YOUR DIRTY CLOTHES.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.207
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO
NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:48.207 --> 16:51.077
(whirring)
NO!

16:51.077 --> 16:53.579
REMI, WHAT IS GOING ON?

16:53.579 --> 16:58.117
THE STUFF IN THAT BAG
COST ME $6,000. (sighs)

16:58.117 --> 17:01.020
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
USING TIDE?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.622
IT'S A LOT CHEAPER.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.992
IT WASN'T DETERGENT,
VALENTINA.

17:05.992 --> 17:09.195
IT WAS COCAINE.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.064
<i>COCAINE?</i>

17:12.064 --> 17:14.267
I'VE BEEN A LITTLE
STRESSED OUT LATELY, ALL RIGHT?

17:14.267 --> 17:16.168
WITH MY MOM'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
AND SCHOOL...

17:16.168 --> 17:18.971
WHAT'S GOING ON AT SCHOOL?

17:18.971 --> 17:22.008
I'M FAILING ALL MY CLASSES.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.013
OH.
LOOK... (sniffs)

17:27.013 --> 17:28.314
I JUST NEEDED A LITTLE BIT

17:28.314 --> 17:30.283
TO HELP ME GET
THROUGH THE DAY. THAT'S ALL.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.751
ARE YOU DOING
ANYTHING ELSE?

17:31.751 --> 17:33.686
LIKE WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.055
AM I GONNA FIND ECSTASY
IN YOUR BEDROOM?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.524
WELL, IF YOU DID, YOU'D PROBABLY
USE IT AS FABRIC SOFTENER.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.459
REMI, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

17:40.459 --> 17:41.627
(sighs)

17:41.627 --> 17:44.664
I'VE JUST BEEN DOING COKE,
THAT'S ALL.

17:44.664 --> 17:48.034
OKAY.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.335
LISTEN TO ME.

17:49.335 --> 17:53.439
YOU CANNOT TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS, ALL RIGHT?

17:53.439 --> 17:54.707
MY MOM WILL FREAK,

17:54.707 --> 17:56.208
AND SHE'S ALREADY
BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.044
YOU'RE PUTTING ME
IN A HORRIBLE POSITION.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.979
I'M BROKE. (chuckles)
I'M BROKE.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.747
I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.516
ALL RIGHT? NOW COME ON.

18:03.516 --> 18:07.520
IF YOU CARE ABOUT ME AT ALL,
YOU'LL PROMISE.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.223
OKAY. I PROMISE.

18:11.223 --> 18:14.126
THANK YOU.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.063
(sniffs)

18:23.002 --> 18:25.796
(chuckles)

18:25.796 --> 18:27.698
GIRLFRIEND?

18:27.698 --> 18:29.867
YES, <i>BOYFRIEND?</i>

18:29.867 --> 18:32.603
WHY DO YOU
BUY STEAKS HERE?

18:32.603 --> 18:35.940
THE BUTCHER IS A FAN OF MINE,
SO SHE GIVES ME A DISCOUNT.

18:35.940 --> 18:39.277
HMM. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
A LADY BUTCHER.

18:39.277 --> 18:40.878
WELL, BERTHA ISN'T LIKE
OTHER PEOPLE.

18:40.878 --> 18:43.214
SHE'S A LITTLE... ODD.
ODD?

18:43.214 --> 18:45.116
HOW IS SHE... ODD?
(doors open)

18:45.116 --> 18:48.786
HEY, SUPERSTAR!
GIVE ME A HUG!
(laughs)

18:48.786 --> 18:50.588
I'D LOVE TO, BERTHA.
BUT... (voice screeches)

18:50.588 --> 18:54.325
OH, SORRY. SOMETIMES I FORGET
HOW DISGUSTING I AM.

18:54.325 --> 18:55.793
(Sam and Carmen laugh)
UHH!

18:55.793 --> 18:58.663
OH! HOW YOU DOING?
(moans)
MM, GOOD.

18:58.663 --> 19:00.631
DID YOU GET SOME
NICE STEAKS FOR ME TODAY?

19:00.631 --> 19:03.701
OOH, YOU KNOW I DO.
HENRY! GRAB THOSE STEAKS

19:03.701 --> 19:05.670
THAT I PUT INSIDE
FOR MISS CARMEN.

19:05.670 --> 19:08.606
AND GET MY PILL CASE.
FORGOT TO TAKE MY MEDS TODAY.
(chuckles)

19:08.606 --> 19:11.542
BERTHA... I WANT YOU
TO MEET SOMEONE.

19:11.542 --> 19:15.012
THIS ISN'T THE BOYFRIEND,
IS IT?
IT SURE IS.

19:15.012 --> 19:16.747
OH, IT'S AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE.

19:16.747 --> 19:19.083
MISS CARMEN TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

19:19.083 --> 19:21.686
AND HER EYES JUST LIGHT UP.

19:21.686 --> 19:26.224
DO THEY <i>REALLY?</i>
REMEMBER, SHE FORGOT
TO TAKE HER MEDS.

19:26.224 --> 19:27.825
OKAY. (chuckles)

19:27.825 --> 19:29.961
SO, UH, HOW DID
YOU TWO MEET?

19:29.961 --> 19:33.197
WELL, UH, CARMEN IS A MAID
FOR ALEJANDRO RUBIO,

19:33.197 --> 19:35.066
AND I'M SORT OF HIS BUTLER.

19:35.066 --> 19:36.934
OH, I BET YOU ARE.
(chuckles)

19:36.934 --> 19:40.071
OKAY. CALM DOWN, BERTHA.

19:40.071 --> 19:42.306
NOW I KNOW THAT MISS CARMEN
IS GOING TO BE A FAMOUS SINGER.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.742
HOW ABOUT YOU? WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?

19:44.742 --> 19:47.078
ACTUALLY,
I'M HAPPY DOING WHAT I DO.

19:47.078 --> 19:48.579
GOOD FOR YOU, SAM.

19:48.579 --> 19:51.682
SO MANY PEOPLE
HATE THEIR JOBS.
NOT ME.

19:51.682 --> 19:53.184
GOOD HOURS,
NICE PLACE TO LIVE.

19:53.184 --> 19:56.187
I WOULDN'T MIND BEING A BUTLER
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

19:56.187 --> 19:58.623
I LIKE YOU, SAM.

19:58.623 --> 20:00.925
WOULD YOU LIKE FREE MEAT?
I'VE GOT A T-BONE OVER HERE

20:00.925 --> 20:02.860
I'VE BEEN SAVING
FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL.

20:02.860 --> 20:04.629
COME ON.
ALL RIGHT. (chuckles)

20:07.031 --> 20:09.700
(sniffling)
(door closes,
footsteps approach)

20:09.700 --> 20:13.604
(gasps) OLIVIA!
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

20:13.604 --> 20:14.972
WHAT ON EARTH IS WRONG?
(voice breaking) OH.

20:14.972 --> 20:17.041
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR VOICEMAIL.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.744
YOU WERE SO HYSTERICAL.
I'M AT MY WIT'S END.
I REALLY AM. (sniffles)

20:19.744 --> 20:21.078
JUST CALM DOWN.
TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED.

20:21.078 --> 20:23.814
(breathing heavily)
OH, OLIVIA.

20:23.814 --> 20:27.685
(exhales sharply)
IT'S MY VACUUM CLEANER.

20:30.821 --> 20:33.190
YOUR VACUUM CLEANER?
(sniffles)

20:33.190 --> 20:35.226
IT DOESN'T WORK.

20:35.226 --> 20:39.063
AND IT SHOULD,
BECAUSE IT'S BRAND-NEW.

20:39.063 --> 20:43.267
YOU CALLED ME OVER HERE
TO FIX YOUR VACUUM?

20:43.267 --> 20:45.202
FOR GOD SAKE, EVELYN!

20:45.202 --> 20:47.938
I THOUGHT SOMEONE
HAD ATTACKED YOU.
PLEASE DON'T YELL AT ME.

20:47.938 --> 20:50.241
I LEFT A MEETING
WITH MY THERAPIST FOR YOU.

20:50.241 --> 20:52.243
AND I APPRECIATE IT.
WELL, I DON'T.

20:52.243 --> 20:54.045
NEXT TIME,
CALL SOMEONE ELSE.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.546
WHO SHOULD I CALL?

20:55.546 --> 20:57.848
MY FRIENDS DON'T REALLY
CARE ABOUT ME.

20:57.848 --> 21:00.951
(sobbing) MY HUSBAND
WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

21:00.951 --> 21:04.789
(sobbing continues)

21:04.789 --> 21:08.659
I DON'T HAVE A CHILD.

21:08.659 --> 21:11.095
(sniffling)

21:14.165 --> 21:16.834
(sighs)

21:16.834 --> 21:20.104
YOU KNOW WHAT MY PROBLEM IS?

21:20.104 --> 21:23.541
I'M ALL ALONE
IN THIS BIG HOUSE,

21:23.541 --> 21:25.876
AND I'VE GOT TOO MUCH TIME
TO THINK ABOUT MY LIFE.

21:25.876 --> 21:27.778
(chuckles)

21:27.778 --> 21:30.014
WELL, I KNOW WHAT
THAT'S LIKE.

21:30.014 --> 21:31.682
(sighs)

21:35.219 --> 21:36.320
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

21:36.320 --> 21:39.623
WHAT? (sniffling)

21:39.623 --> 21:42.126
WE WILL FIND YOU A MAID.

21:42.126 --> 21:46.130
(chuckles)
SOMEONE WHO WILL TAKE
<i>WONDERFUL</i> CARE OF YOU

21:46.130 --> 21:48.799
AND MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER.

21:48.799 --> 21:50.801
IT'S IRONIC.

21:50.801 --> 21:52.636
WHAT IS?

21:52.636 --> 21:58.209
MY LIFE SUCKS...
BUT MY VACUUM DOESN'T.

22:00.678 --> 22:03.280
(both chuckle)

22:05.816 --> 22:08.219
(sniffles)

22:08.219 --> 22:10.788
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:10.788 --> 22:12.757
NOTHING.

22:15.059 --> 22:16.894
SINCE WHEN DO YOU CRY
OVER NOTHING?

22:16.894 --> 22:18.996
(sighs) I'VE JUST BEEN
WORRIED ABOUT, UM,

22:18.996 --> 22:23.067
A FRIEND WHO HAS GOTTEN HIMSELF
INTO SOME TROUBLE.

22:23.067 --> 22:26.003
AND YOU CAN'T HELP HIM?

22:26.003 --> 22:30.074
(voice breaking) I WANT TO,
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.

22:30.074 --> 22:32.610
I BET I'D KNOW.

22:35.679 --> 22:37.214
HE MADE ME PROMISE
NOT TO TELL.

22:37.214 --> 22:40.551
NOW WHY WOULD REMI
MAKE YOU PROMISE THAT?

22:40.551 --> 22:42.753
HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT'S REMI?

22:42.753 --> 22:44.588
YOU'RE IN HIS ROOM.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIS PICTURE.

22:44.588 --> 22:46.957
BEHOLD, MY PSYCHIC POWER.

22:46.957 --> 22:48.692
<i>MAMI,</i> I CAN'T
TALK ABOUT THIS.

22:48.692 --> 22:49.827
HE'D BE SO ANGRY WITH ME.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.529
DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT HIM?

22:51.529 --> 22:53.998
OF COURSE! I LOVE HIM.
THEN DO WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM

22:53.998 --> 22:56.934
AND NOT WHAT'S
COMFORTABLE FOR YOU.

23:02.873 --> 23:05.776
REMI IS USING DRUGS.

23:05.776 --> 23:07.077
COCAINE?

23:08.746 --> 23:09.947
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

23:11.248 --> 23:13.317
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.

23:13.317 --> 23:14.819
REALLY?

23:14.819 --> 23:17.555
REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

23:17.555 --> 23:20.558
HE WENT TO LONDON
TO STUDY FOR THE SUMMER?

23:20.558 --> 23:23.227
HE WAS ACTUALLY IN REHAB.

23:24.995 --> 23:26.297
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

23:26.297 --> 23:28.132
YOU WERE 12.

23:28.132 --> 23:30.100
I WASN'T GONNA
DISCUSS ADDICTION

23:30.100 --> 23:33.971
WITH SOMEBODY WHO WAS
STILL PLAYING WITH DOLLS.

23:36.941 --> 23:39.076
SO MRS. DELATOUR KNEW?
YEAH.

23:39.076 --> 23:42.079
SHE FELL APART.
SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HELP HIM.

23:42.079 --> 23:43.848
(crying)

23:43.848 --> 23:47.151
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO HELP HIM EITHER.

23:47.151 --> 23:48.819
IT'S OKAY, BABY...

23:48.819 --> 23:51.222
BECAUSE I DO.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.324
COME HERE.

23:57.928 --> 24:00.931
(keys clacking)

24:02.733 --> 24:05.069
(cell phone alert chimes)

24:05.069 --> 24:07.037
(beep)

24:10.808 --> 24:13.878
(buttons clicking)

24:13.878 --> 24:16.547
(cell phone whooshes, clatters)

24:19.149 --> 24:21.552
(cell phone alert chimes)

24:23.554 --> 24:25.022
(sighs)

24:25.022 --> 24:28.025
(buttons clicking)

24:29.960 --> 24:32.062
(cell phone whooshes)

24:38.903 --> 24:40.204
(typing)

24:44.008 --> 24:47.011
(typing continues)

24:53.017 --> 24:54.118
(keys clack)

25:00.090 --> 25:01.792
HEY, ROSIE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:01.792 --> 25:04.094
I NEED TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

25:06.797 --> 25:09.800
THAT WOMAN AT THE STORE
WAS RIGHT.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.136
YOU ARE
AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.872
I CAN EXPLAIN.
CAN YOU?

25:14.872 --> 25:18.075
MOST MAIDS LEARN ENGLISH.
THEY DON'T TEACH IT.

25:18.075 --> 25:19.777
THE UNIVERSITY MADE
BUDGET CUTS.

25:19.777 --> 25:21.312
I LOST MY JOB,
AND I NEEDED MONEY.

25:21.312 --> 25:22.780
SO YOU THOUGHT,

25:22.780 --> 25:25.783
"WHY NOT CLEAN HOUSES
FOR A LIVING?"

25:25.783 --> 25:28.152
IT'S BEVERLY HILLS.
(papers rustle)

25:28.152 --> 25:30.688
THE PAY
IS SURPRISINGLY GOOD.

25:30.688 --> 25:33.223
SO WHY DID YOU
NEVER SAY ANYTHING?

25:34.959 --> 25:37.928
I WAS EMBARRASSED.

25:37.928 --> 25:39.196
SEE...

25:39.196 --> 25:42.032
I THINK YOU'RE LYING.

25:44.635 --> 25:46.804
THAT IS NOT
A NICE THING TO SAY.

25:46.804 --> 25:49.807
I DON'T LIKE SAYING IT.

25:49.807 --> 25:52.610
WE ARE FRIENDS, MARISOL.

25:52.610 --> 25:54.979
IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE,
I'LL HELP YOU.

25:54.979 --> 25:57.815
BUT I NEED TO KNOW
THE TRUTH.

26:00.084 --> 26:03.020
(sighs) OKAY.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.688
YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:04.688 --> 26:08.158
I DID HAVE A SECRET REASON
FOR TAKING THIS JOB.

26:08.158 --> 26:10.227
WHAT WAS IT?

26:10.227 --> 26:13.197
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHO KILLED FLORA HERNANDEZ.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.666
WHY?

26:15.666 --> 26:17.201
THEY ALREADY
ARRESTED THAT BOY.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.802
DO YOU NOT THINK
HE DID IT?

26:18.802 --> 26:22.973
NO! NO! YOU SEE,
HE LOVED HER.

26:22.973 --> 26:25.676
HE WOULD NEVER
HAVE HURT HER.

26:25.676 --> 26:27.144
YOU KNOW THAT BOY?

26:30.714 --> 26:33.083
HE'S MY SON.

26:35.686 --> 26:37.655
<i>DIOS SANTO.</i>

26:37.655 --> 26:40.257
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE,
I'VE BEEN COLLECTING EVIDENCE.

26:40.257 --> 26:42.993
AND I'VE LEARNED THINGS
ABOUT FLORA.
YEAH, THINGS WE TOLD YOU!

26:42.993 --> 26:44.828
SHE WAS <i>NOT</i>
WHO SHE SEEMED TO BE!

26:44.828 --> 26:48.932
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY...
COMING FROM YOU.
PLEASE UNDERSTAND.

26:48.932 --> 26:51.535
I AM TRYING TO SAVE
MY SON'S LIFE!

26:51.535 --> 26:55.039
LET GO OF ME.
ROSIE, WE'RE FRIENDS.

26:55.039 --> 26:57.941
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
HELP ME.

26:57.941 --> 27:00.577
I DON'T WANT TO HELP
A MURDERER.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.213
AND WE ARE <i>NOT</i> FRIENDS.

27:04.682 --> 27:07.584
NOT ANYMORE.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.954
(door opens and closes)

27:19.596 --> 27:21.265
(line rings)

27:21.265 --> 27:22.966
(ring, click)

27:22.966 --> 27:24.802
<i>(woman) You've reached</i>
<i>the office of Ida Hayes,</i>

27:24.802 --> 27:27.071
<i>Attorney-at-Law.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>
(beep)

27:27.071 --> 27:30.774
IDA, IT'S MARISOL.
ROSIE KNOWS ABOUT EDDIE.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.143
I THINK SHE'S GONNA
TELL THE GIRLS...
(cell phone alert chimes)

27:33.143 --> 27:35.779
UM... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.081
CAN YOU CALL ME
AS SOON AS YOU CAN?

27:37.081 --> 27:39.083
THANKS.
(cell phone alert chimes)

27:42.286 --> 27:43.754
(chimes)

27:43.754 --> 27:44.822
(beep)

27:51.528 --> 27:54.798
(Sam grunts)
DO YOU NEED HELP?

27:54.798 --> 27:56.233
(strained voice)
NOPE. NOPE.

27:56.233 --> 27:58.268
CHIVALRY IS NOT DEAD,
JUST A LITTLE OUT OF SHAPE.

27:58.268 --> 28:01.038
SAM, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
(grunts)

28:01.038 --> 28:04.041
WHEN WE WERE AT THE STORE
TALKING TO BERTHA,

28:04.041 --> 28:06.210
WERE YOU JOKING?
(normal voice) ABOUT WHAT?

28:06.210 --> 28:07.878
BEING A BUTLER.

28:07.878 --> 28:11.081
I MEAN, YOU REALLY THINK
THIS IS THE PERFECT JOB FOR YOU?

28:11.081 --> 28:12.816
SURE.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.552
BUT YOU'RE SO SMART
AND TALENTED.

28:15.552 --> 28:17.955
YOU COULD BE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO BE.

28:17.955 --> 28:20.224
AS IT TURNS OUT,
I WANT TO BE A BUTLER.

28:20.224 --> 28:21.892
(chuckles)

28:21.892 --> 28:23.227
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

28:23.227 --> 28:24.595
WHY NOT?

28:24.595 --> 28:25.996
I DON'T KNOW.

28:25.996 --> 28:29.199
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE...
AMBITIOUS... LIKE ME.

28:29.199 --> 28:30.934
(chuckles)
HERE'S A NEWS FLASH, CARMEN.

28:30.934 --> 28:32.636
NOT EVERYONE IS LIKE YOU.

28:32.636 --> 28:34.905
WELL, THEY SHOULD BE.
REALLY?

28:34.905 --> 28:36.874
EVERYONE SHOULD WANT
TO BE A STAR?

28:36.874 --> 28:38.308
EVERYONE SHOULD WANT
TO ACCOMPLISH

28:38.308 --> 28:40.944
AS MUCH AS THEY CAN IN LIFE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

28:40.944 --> 28:43.113
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH?

28:43.113 --> 28:44.681
HAPPINESS.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.317
OKAY. SO YOU'RE HAPPY
FIXING SOMEONE ELSE'S DRAIN?

28:47.317 --> 28:49.887
YOU'RE HAPPY WAXING
SOMEONE ELSE'S BENTLEY?

28:49.887 --> 28:51.955
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I AM.

28:51.955 --> 28:54.158
<i>REALLY?</i>
HOW ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE 80...

28:54.158 --> 28:56.293
LIVING IN
A RAT-INFESTED APARTMENT?

28:56.293 --> 28:58.028
IS THAT GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY?

28:58.028 --> 29:00.764
HMM? WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN
AFFORD TO PAY THE RENT?

29:00.764 --> 29:03.267
I FEEL IF I SAVE MY MONEY
AND INVEST WISELY,

29:03.267 --> 29:04.802
I'LL ALWAYS BE ABLE
TO AFFORD

29:04.802 --> 29:06.770
A RAT-INFESTED APARTMENT.

29:06.770 --> 29:08.071
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

29:08.071 --> 29:09.239
JUST PUT AWAY THE GROCERIES.
CARMEN!

29:09.239 --> 29:10.874
IT'S MENIAL LABOR.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.576
I'M SURE IT'S GONNA MAKE YOU
ORGASM WITH HAPPINESS.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.678
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
SUCH A SNOB ABOUT MONEY?

29:14.678 --> 29:17.214
THIS ISN'T ABOUT MONEY.
IT'S ABOUT AMBITION.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.783
YOU SHOULD WANT TO DO SOMETHING
<i>AMAZING</i> WITH YOUR LIFE.

29:19.783 --> 29:21.018
WHY ARE YOU BEING
THIS WAY?

29:21.018 --> 29:22.786
LOOK, I'VE BEEN A BUTLER
SINCE YOU MET ME.

29:22.786 --> 29:23.887
WHAT'S CHANGED?

29:23.887 --> 29:27.024
YOU'RE MY... BOYFRIEND NOW.

29:27.024 --> 29:31.762
SO?
SO I'M STARTING TO...

29:31.762 --> 29:34.731
TO FEEL... THINGS FOR YOU.
DEEP THINGS.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.067
BUT THAT'S GREAT.

29:37.067 --> 29:41.038
I MEAN,
WHY DOES THAT MAKE YOU SAD?

29:41.038 --> 29:43.807
BECAUSE... WE CAN'T HAVE
A FUTURE TOGETHER

29:43.807 --> 29:46.009
IF YOU'RE HAPPY
TREADING WATER.

29:46.009 --> 29:47.878
WHY DOES IT MATTER
WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING?

29:47.878 --> 29:50.981
SAM... I KNOW ME.

29:50.981 --> 29:54.117
AND I'M NEVER GONNA MARRY
A BUTLER.

30:08.799 --> 30:10.033
(door handle clacks)

30:10.033 --> 30:11.568
CAN I COME IN?

30:11.568 --> 30:13.303
THERE'S SOME THINGS
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

30:13.303 --> 30:14.705
WHY BOTHER?

30:14.705 --> 30:17.808
I WON'T BELIEVE
A WORD YOU SAY.

30:17.808 --> 30:22.212
TWO MINUTES.
THAT'S ALL I ASK.

30:27.818 --> 30:29.253
(door closes)

30:36.560 --> 30:37.794
WHAT IS THAT?

30:37.794 --> 30:40.664
IT'S THE MONEY
YOU AND THE GIRLS GAVE ME.

30:40.664 --> 30:43.133
I GUESS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR
DOESN'T NEED A LOAN.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.635
SOME MIGHT.

30:44.635 --> 30:45.936
BUT I DON'T.

30:45.936 --> 30:49.006
DID IT MAKE YOU LAUGH?

30:49.006 --> 30:51.875
WATCHING US
TRYING TO HELP YOU?

30:51.875 --> 30:54.945
NOT AT ALL.
I WAS INCREDIBLY TOUCHED.

30:54.945 --> 30:57.080
YOU LIED TO OUR FACES.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.815
PRETENDING TO BE A MAID.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.785
PRETENDING TO BE OUR <i>FRIEND.</i>

31:01.785 --> 31:03.153
YOU WERE CLOSE TO FLORA,

31:03.153 --> 31:05.088
AND I NEEDED TO KNOW
THE TRUTH ABOUT HER.

31:05.088 --> 31:07.090
SO YOU ADMIT
YOU WERE JUST USING US?

31:07.090 --> 31:09.693
I AM TRYING TO GET
MY SON OUT OF JAIL!

31:12.062 --> 31:14.197
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?

31:14.197 --> 31:16.099
I GOT THIS WEIRD
PHONE CALL FROM ROSIE.

31:16.099 --> 31:17.768
IT'S SOMETHING
ABOUT MARISOL.

31:17.768 --> 31:19.136
SHE SAID SHE NEEDED US HERE
IMMEDIATELY.

31:19.136 --> 31:22.039
SHE SOUNDED HYSTERICAL.

31:22.039 --> 31:23.707
WELL,
YOU CAN STOP PRETENDING

31:23.707 --> 31:25.943
'CAUSE I AM TELLING <i>EVERYONE</i>
WHO YOU REALLY ARE!

31:25.943 --> 31:28.211
I DON'T THINK SO.

31:28.211 --> 31:30.280
YOU JUST WATCH ME.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.683
WELL, THEN I GUESS I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TELL PERI WESTMORE

31:32.683 --> 31:35.052
THAT YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH HER HUSBAND.

31:35.052 --> 31:36.787
(voice breaking) WHAT?

31:36.787 --> 31:40.557
<i>YEAH.</i> I KNOW ABOUT SPENCE.

31:40.557 --> 31:42.259
HOW?

31:47.030 --> 31:49.566
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

31:49.566 --> 31:53.136
YOU DON'T TELL MY SECRET.
I WON'T TELL YOURS.

31:56.807 --> 31:59.676
I... <i>HATE</i> YOU!

31:59.676 --> 32:01.545
(door closes)
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.213
(Zoila) GUYS?

32:04.681 --> 32:06.817
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

32:06.817 --> 32:12.222
WE'RE JUST HAVING
A LITTLE... DISAGREEMENT.

32:12.222 --> 32:14.091
ABOUT WHAT?

32:16.093 --> 32:19.029
MARISOL DOESN'T WANT
OUR MONEY.

32:21.531 --> 32:23.066
I'M SORRY?

32:23.066 --> 32:27.571
YEAH. SHE SAID
SHE DOESN'T NEED IT.

32:27.571 --> 32:30.073
AND ROSIE WAS
SOMEWHAT INSULTED.

32:30.073 --> 32:33.744
WELL...
THAT'S NOTHING TO FIGHT OVER.

32:33.744 --> 32:36.079
IF SHE DOESN'T NEED IT,
SHE DOESN'T NEED IT.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.048
I HOPE
YOU WEREN'T OFFENDED.

32:38.048 --> 32:40.550
NO. NOT AT ALL.

32:40.550 --> 32:43.954
IT MADE ME REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT
YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS TO ME.

32:43.954 --> 32:47.557
I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

32:47.557 --> 32:51.128
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN ALL
MEET UP FOR LUNCH TOMORROW?

32:51.128 --> 32:53.630
SOUNDS GREAT.
YEAH.

32:53.630 --> 32:56.133
I'M BUSY TOMORROW.

32:56.133 --> 32:58.869
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

33:03.073 --> 33:06.943
SHE'LL BE FINE. LET'S GO.

33:13.550 --> 33:14.684
(sighs)

33:14.684 --> 33:16.653
ZOILA, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY CAR KEYS?

33:16.653 --> 33:18.688
ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

33:18.688 --> 33:21.091
A FRIEND'S HAVING A PARTY.
I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY.

33:21.091 --> 33:24.928
OKAY.

33:24.928 --> 33:29.533
SO... CAR KEYS?

33:29.533 --> 33:30.801
THEY'RE IN THE KITCHEN.

33:32.235 --> 33:34.905
BEFORE YOU GO...

33:34.905 --> 33:36.673
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

33:36.673 --> 33:38.542
I GUESS.

33:42.779 --> 33:44.614
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

33:44.614 --> 33:48.952
DO YOU REMEMBER THE DAY
YOU LEARNED HOW TO RIDE A BIKE?

33:48.952 --> 33:51.188
NO.
I DO.

33:51.188 --> 33:53.590
(chuckles) YOUR MOTHER TRIED
TO TEACH YOU,

33:53.590 --> 33:55.192
BUT YOU KEPT FALLING.

33:55.192 --> 33:57.294
AND YOUR MOTHER
BECAME SO FRUSTRATED,

33:57.294 --> 34:00.197
<i>SHE</i> STARTED TO CRY.
(chuckles)

34:00.197 --> 34:01.932
YOU FINALLY TOLD HER
NOT TO WORRY.

34:01.932 --> 34:03.600
SHE COULD GO INSIDE, AND YOU
COULD LEARN TO RIDE THE BIKE

34:03.600 --> 34:06.903
ALL BY YOURSELF.
(chuckles) YOU WERE SO CUTE.

34:06.903 --> 34:09.840
HOW OLD WAS I?

34:09.840 --> 34:11.975
YOU WERE 6.

34:11.975 --> 34:14.845
IT'S THE STORY
OF YOUR LIFE--

34:14.845 --> 34:16.279
YOU TAKING CARE
OF YOUR MOTHER

34:16.279 --> 34:18.215
WHEN SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
TAKING CARE OF YOU.

34:18.215 --> 34:20.550
WELL, SHE DOES THE BEST
SHE CAN.

34:20.550 --> 34:22.953
BUT IT'S NOT RIGHT.

34:22.953 --> 34:25.956
WHEN CHILDREN FALL,
THEY NEED TO KNOW

34:25.956 --> 34:29.693
SOMEONE WILL BE THERE
TO PICK THEM UP.

34:29.693 --> 34:32.596
WHY ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT THIS?

34:32.596 --> 34:34.664
I'VE WATCHED YOU
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

34:34.664 --> 34:37.567
TRYING SO HARD TO BE
THE PERFECT SON

34:37.567 --> 34:40.670
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
YOUR MOTHER DEPENDS UPON YOU.

34:40.670 --> 34:42.539
BUT WHO DO YOU DEPEND UPON?

34:42.539 --> 34:44.674
WHO DO YOU TURN TO
WHEN YOU'RE STRESSED OUT

34:44.674 --> 34:48.745
ABOUT SCHOOL OR MONEY...
OR RELATIONSHIPS?

34:50.714 --> 34:52.215
VALENTINA TOLD YOU,
DIDN'T SHE?

34:52.215 --> 34:56.019
AND I'M TELLING <i>YOU</i>
THAT IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO FALL

34:56.019 --> 34:57.821
BECAUSE THOSE OF US
WHO LOVE YOU

34:57.821 --> 34:59.723
WILL BE THERE
TO PICK YOU UP AGAIN.
(sighs)

34:59.723 --> 35:03.326
WHERE ARE MY CAR KEYS?
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO THAT PARTY.

35:03.326 --> 35:06.163
MY PERSONAL LIFE
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
(vehicle approaches)

35:06.163 --> 35:07.731
YOU'RE THE HOUSEKEEPER.

35:08.932 --> 35:11.201
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

35:11.201 --> 35:14.204
(vehicle door closes)
IT'S TRUE.
I CAN'T MAKE YOU DO ANYTHING.

35:14.204 --> 35:18.208
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THE ONE PERSON WHO CAN.

35:18.208 --> 35:19.643
(door opens)

35:19.643 --> 35:21.811
(door closes)

35:21.811 --> 35:24.014
DAD?

35:24.014 --> 35:26.049
WHERE'S HIS SUITCASE?

35:26.049 --> 35:27.651
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

35:27.651 --> 35:29.686
WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:29.686 --> 35:31.721
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO REHAB.

35:31.721 --> 35:33.723
WHAT?! NO! DAD, COME ON!
SORRY, SON.

35:33.723 --> 35:35.559
I HAVE FINALS COMING UP.

35:35.559 --> 35:37.894
I CAN'T--
COLLEGE WILL STILL BE HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

35:37.894 --> 35:40.730
I AM NOT OUT OF CONTROL
THIS TIME.

35:40.730 --> 35:44.034
I SWEAR.
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

35:44.034 --> 35:46.536
PLEASE.
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

35:46.536 --> 35:48.205
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS
<i>TO</i> YOU.

35:48.205 --> 35:50.874
WE'RE DOING IT <i>FOR</i> YOU.

35:52.008 --> 35:53.777
LET'S GO, SON.

36:08.825 --> 36:12.796
(door closes)

36:17.701 --> 36:20.036
(switch clicks)

36:22.672 --> 36:25.075
I NEED TO TELL YOU
ABOUT MY DAD.

36:25.075 --> 36:28.111
(sighs) SAM, IT'S 1:00
IN THE MORNING.

36:28.111 --> 36:30.547
HE WORKED AT THIS
INSURANCE FIRM FOR 30 YEARS,

36:30.547 --> 36:34.084
AND HE HATED IT, BUT HE DID IT
TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY.

36:34.084 --> 36:36.253
AND THEN HE HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

36:36.253 --> 36:38.955
AND HE DIED.

36:40.690 --> 36:43.226
I DON'T THINK HE EVER
REALLY ENJOYED HIS LIFE.

36:43.226 --> 36:47.063
UH, WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

36:47.063 --> 36:49.165
BECAUSE I THINK
I'VE BEEN USING IT

36:49.165 --> 36:51.668
AS AN EXCUSE
NOT TO PUSH MYSELF.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.971
I'M CAPABLE OF MORE,
BUT IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING

36:54.971 --> 36:56.806
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

36:56.806 --> 36:58.808
THAT'S GREAT.

36:58.808 --> 37:02.212
OKAY, C-CAN WE MAYBE TALK
ABOUT THIS IN THE MORNING?

37:02.212 --> 37:03.813
I WON'T BE HERE
IN THE MORNING.

37:03.813 --> 37:06.249
I JUST QUIT.
I'M LEAVING TONIGHT.

37:06.249 --> 37:08.084
<i>WHAT?</i>

37:08.084 --> 37:10.186
I-I'VE GIVEN THIS
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.554
AND I'M GOING TO BE SOMEBODY

37:11.554 --> 37:12.956
YOU WANT TO SPEND
YOUR LIFE WITH.

37:12.956 --> 37:16.226
YOU CAN'T JUST QUIT.
TH-THAT'S <i>CRAZY.</i>

37:16.226 --> 37:17.661
IT'S NOT.

37:17.661 --> 37:19.029
YOU WERE RIGHT....

37:19.029 --> 37:21.197
ABOUT ALL OF IT.

37:21.197 --> 37:24.968
I CAN BE MORE.
I CAN DO MORE.

37:24.968 --> 37:28.071
YOU'RE ONLY WRONG
ABOUT ONE THING.

37:28.071 --> 37:32.942
(chuckles) I AS AM AMBITIOUS
AS ANY MAN WHO'S EVER LIVED.

37:32.942 --> 37:35.111
BUT MY REAL AMBITION...

37:35.111 --> 37:37.681
IS YOU.

37:37.681 --> 37:40.550
(voice breaking)
SAM, PLEASE. DON'T DO THIS.

37:45.255 --> 37:49.693
IT'S OKAY. I'LL BE BACK.

37:56.066 --> 37:57.567
(knock on door)

38:01.137 --> 38:03.807
<i>BUEN DíA,</i> RAUL.

38:03.807 --> 38:07.077
(speaking Spanish)

38:07.077 --> 38:10.914
(envelope rustles)

38:48.952 --> 38:50.653
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

38:50.653 --> 38:53.823
UH... SURE.

38:58.561 --> 39:01.164
MY SON SENT ME THIS.

39:04.768 --> 39:07.270
OH, REALLY?

39:07.270 --> 39:09.539
(chuckles)
MIGUEL DREW THIS?

39:09.539 --> 39:11.941
THIS IS WHAT HE THINKS
HE WILL LOOK LIKE

39:11.941 --> 39:14.544
WHEN HE COMES TO AMERICA.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

39:14.544 --> 39:17.080
THAT'S HIM
GETTING OFF THE PLANE,

39:17.080 --> 39:20.717
AND THAT IS ME WAITING
FOR HIM. (chuckles)

39:20.717 --> 39:23.086
IT'S SO SWEET.

39:23.086 --> 39:24.788
WHEN I SAW THIS,

39:24.788 --> 39:27.791
IT MADE ME THINK
ABOUT MY SON.

39:27.791 --> 39:31.194
HE'S SO KIND AND SWEET.

39:31.194 --> 39:34.697
IF SOMEONE SAID
HE HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG,

39:34.697 --> 39:36.132
I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THEM.

39:37.967 --> 39:40.537
AND I WOULD DO
<i>EVERYTHING</i> I COULD

39:40.537 --> 39:42.138
TO PROTECT HIM.

39:42.138 --> 39:45.308
JUST LIKE YOU ARE DOING
FOR YOUR SON.

39:45.308 --> 39:46.943
OH, ROSIE. I AM...

39:46.943 --> 39:50.814
I AM <i>SO</i> SORRY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

39:50.814 --> 39:52.682
I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.717
IT'S TORN ME UP INSIDE

39:54.717 --> 39:56.586
NOT TO BE HONEST
WITH ALL OF YOU, REALLY.

39:56.586 --> 39:57.921
BUT NO MORE.

39:57.921 --> 39:59.989
I'M GOING TO TELL
CARMEN AND ZOILA TODAY.

39:59.989 --> 40:05.562
NO. YOU KEEP YOUR SECRET.
IT'S SAFER.

40:05.562 --> 40:08.932
ARE YOU SURE?

40:08.932 --> 40:11.734
YEAH.

40:11.734 --> 40:13.770
BUT IT'S GOOD
I KNOW THE TRUTH,

40:13.770 --> 40:16.072
BECAUSE NOW I CAN HELP YOU.

40:18.074 --> 40:19.209
YOU WOULD DO THAT
FOR ME?

40:19.209 --> 40:21.544
OF COURSE.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.680
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

40:23.680 --> 40:26.716
NOW TELL ME,
WHAT CAN I DO? HMM?

40:29.652 --> 40:31.788
(doorbell rings)

40:33.189 --> 40:35.558
HELLO.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.628
I HEARD YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR A NEW MAID?
